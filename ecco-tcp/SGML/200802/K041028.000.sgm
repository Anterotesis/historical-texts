<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON A LATE STATE OF THE NATION.</HEAD>
<P>PARTY divi&s;ions, whether on the whole operating for good or evil, are things in&s;eparable from free government. This is a truth which, I believe, admits little di&s;pute, having been e&s;tabli&s;hed by the uniform experience of all ages. The part a good citizen ought to take in the&s;e divi&s;ions, has been a matter of much deeper controver&s;y. But God forbid, that any controver&s;y relating to our e&s;&s;ential morals &s;hould admit of no deci&s;ion. It appears to me, that this que&s;tion, like mo&s;t of the others which regard our duties in life, is to be determined by our &s;tation in it. Private men may be wholly neutral, and entirely innocent: but they who are legally inve&s;ted with public tru&s;t, or &s;tand on the high ground of rank and dignity, which is tru&s;t implied, can hardly in any ca&s;e remain indifferent, without the certainty of &s;inking into in&s;ignifi|cance; and thereby in effect de&s;erting that po&s;t in which with the fulle&s;t authority, and for the wi&s;e&s;t purpo&s;es, the laws and in&s;titutions of their country had fixed them. However, if it be the office of tho&s;e who are thus circum&s;tanced, to take a decided part, it is no le&s;s their duty that it &s;hould be a &s;ober one. It ought to be circum&s;cribed by the &s;ame laws of decorum, and balanced by the &s;ame temper, which bound and regulate all the virtues. In a word, we ought to act in party with all the modera|tion which does not ab&s;olutely enervate that vigour and quench that
<PB N="2" REF="3">
fervency of &s;pirit without which the be&s;t wi&s;hes for the public good mu&s;t evaporate in empty &s;peculation.</P>
<P>It is probably from &s;ome &s;uch motives that the friends of a very re&s;pectable party in this kingdom have been hitherto &s;ilent. For the&s;e two years pa&s;t, from one and the &s;ame quarter of politicks, a continual fire has been kept upon them; &s;ometimes from the unweildy column of quartos and octavos; &s;ometimes from the light &s;quadrons of occa&s;ional pamphlets and flying &s;heets. Every month has brought on its periodi|cal calumny. The abu&s;e has taken every &s;hape which the ability of the writers could give it; plain invective, clum&s;y raillery, mi&s;repre&s;ented anecdote <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of the Minority. Hi&s;tory of the Repeal of the Stamp-act. Con&s;iderations on Trade and Finances. Political Regi&s;ter, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE> No method of vilifying the mea&s;ures, the abilities, the inten|tions, or the per&s;ons which compo&s;e that body, has been omitted.</P>
<P>On their part nothing was oppo&s;ed but patience and character. It was a matter of the mo&s;t &s;erious and indignant affliction to per&s;ons, who thought them&s;elves in con&s;cience bound to oppo&s;e a mini&s;try, dangerous from its very con&s;titution, as well as its mea&s;ures, to find them&s;elves, whenever they faced their adver&s;aries, continually attacked on the rear by a &s;et of men, who pretended to be actuated by motives &s;imilar to theirs. They &s;aw that the plan long pur&s;ued with but too fatal a &s;ucce&s;s, was to break the &s;trength of this kingdom; by frittering down the bodies which compo&s;e it; by fomenting bitter and &s;anguinary animo&s;ities, and by di&s;&s;olving every tie of &s;ocial affection and public tru&s;t. The&s;e virtuous men, &s;uch I am warranted by public opinion to call them, were re&s;olved rather to endure every thing, than cooperate in that de&s;ign. A diver&s;ity of opinion upon almo&s;t every principle of politics, had indeed drawn a &s;trong line of &s;eparation between them and &s;ome others. However, they were de&s;irous not to extend the misfortune by un|nece&s;&s;ary bitterne&s;s; they wi&s;hed to prevent a difference of opinion on the commonwealth from fe&s;tering into rancorous and incurable ho&s;tility. Accordingly they endeavoured that all pa&s;t controver&s;ies &s;hould be for|gotten; and that enough for the day &s;hould be the evil thereof. There is however a limit at which forbearance cea&s;es to be a virtue. Men may tolerate injuries, whil&s;t they are only per&s;onal to them&s;elves. But it is not the fir&s;t of virtues to bear with moderation the indignities that are offered to our country. A piece has at length appeared, from the quarter of all the former attacks, which upon every public con&s;ideration demands an an&s;wer. Whil&s;t per&s;ons more equal to this bu&s;ine&s;s may be engaged in affairs of greater moment, I hope I &s;hall be excu&s;ed, if, in a few hours of a time not very important, and from &s;uch materials as I have by me (more
<PB N="3" REF="4">
than enough however for this purpo&s;e) I undertake to &s;et the facts and arguments of this wonderful performance in a proper light. I will en|deavour to &s;tate what this piece is; the purpo&s;e for which I take it to have been written; and the effects (&s;uppo&s;ing it &s;hould have any effect at all) it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily produce.</P>
<P>This piece is called, <HI>The pre&s;ent State of the Nation.</HI> It may be con&s;idered as a &s;ort of dige&s;t of the avowed maxims of a certain po|litical &s;chool, the effects of who&s;e doctrines and practices this country will feel long and &s;everely. It is made up of a farrago of almo&s;t every topic which has been agitated in parliamentary debate, or private con|ver&s;ation, on national affairs, for the&s;e &s;even la&s;t years. The olde&s;t controver&s;ies are hawled out of the du&s;t with which time and neglect had covered them. Arguments ten times repeated, a thou&s;and times an&s;wered before, are here repeated again. Public accounts formerly printed and reprinted revolve once more, and find their old &s;tation in this &s;ober meridian. All the common-place lamentations upon the decay of trade, the encrea&s;e of taxes, and the high price of labour and provi&s;ions, are here retailed again and again in the &s;ame tone with which they have drawled through columns of Gazetteers and Adverti&s;ers for a century together. Paradoxes which affront common &s;en&s;e, and un|intere&s;ting barren truths which generate no conclu&s;ion, are thrown in to augment unweildy bulk, without adding any thing to weight. Be|cau&s;e two accu&s;ations are better than one, contradictions are &s;et &s;taring one another in the face, without even an attempt to reconcile them. And to give the whole a &s;ort of portentous air of labour and infor|mation, the table of the Hou&s;e of Commons is &s;wept into this grand re&s;ervoir of politicks.</P>
<P>As to the compo&s;ition, it bears a &s;triking and whim&s;ical re&s;emblance to a funeral &s;ermon, not only in the pathetic prayer with which it concludes, but in the &s;tyle and tenour of the whole performance. It is piteou&s;ly doleful, nodding every now and then towards dulne&s;s; well &s;tored with pious frauds, and, like mo&s;t di&s;cour&s;es of the &s;ort, much better calculated for the private advantage of the preacher than the edification of the hearers.</P>
<P>The author has indeed &s;o involved his &s;ubject that it is frequently far from being ea&s;y to comprehend his meaning. It is happy for the pub|lic that it is never difficult to fathom his de&s;ign. The apparent inten|tion of this author is to draw the mo&s;t aggravated, hideous and deformed picture of the &s;tate of this country, which his querulous eloquence, aided by the arbitrary dominion he a&s;&s;umes over fact, is capable of exhibiting. Had he attributed our misfortunes to their true cau&s;e, the injudicious
<PB N="4" REF="5">
tampering of bold, improvident, and vi&s;ionary mini&s;ters at one period, or to their &s;upine negligence and traiterous di&s;&s;entions at another, the com|plaint had been ju&s;t, and might have been u&s;eful. But far the greater and much the wor&s;t part of the &s;tate which he exhibits is owing, accord|ing to his repre&s;entation, not to accidental and extrin&s;ic mi&s;chiefs at|tendant on the nation, but to its radical weakne&s;s, and con&s;titutional di&s;tempers. All this however is not without purpo&s;e. The author is in hopes that when we are fallen into a fanatical terror for the na|tional &s;alvation, we &s;hall then be ready to throw our&s;elves, in a &s;ort of precipitate tru&s;t, &s;ome &s;trange di&s;po&s;ition of the mind jumbled up of pre&s;umption and de&s;pair, into the hands of the mo&s;t pretending and forward undertaker. One &s;uch undertaker at lea&s;t he has in readine&s;s for our &s;ervice. But let me a&s;&s;ure this generous per&s;on, that, however he may &s;ucceed in exciting our fears for the public danger, he will find it hard indeed to engage us to place any confidence in the &s;y&s;tem he propo&s;es for its &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>His undertaking is great. The purpo&s;e of this pamphlet, and at which it aims directly or obliquely in every page, is to per&s;uade the pub|lic of three or four of the mo&s;t difficult points in the world&mdash;that all the advantages of the late war were on the part of the Bourbon alliance; that the peace of Paris perfectly con&s;ulted the dignity and intere&s;t of this country; and that the American Stamp act was a ma&s;ter piece of policy and finance; that the only good mini&s;ter this nation has en|joyed &s;ince his maje&s;ty's acce&s;&s;ion, is the earl of Bute; and the only good managers of revenue we have &s;een are lord De&s;pen&s;er and Mr. George Gren|ville; and under the de&s;cription of men of virtue and ability, he holds them out to us as the only per&s;ons fit to put our affairs in order. Let not the reader mi&s;take me; he does not actually name the&s;e per&s;ons; but having highly applauded their conduct in all its parts, and heavily cen|&s;ured every other &s;et of men in the kingdom, he then recommends us to his men of virtue and ability.</P>
<P>Such is the author's &s;cheme. Whether it will an&s;wer his purpo&s;e, I know not. But &s;urely that purpo&s;e ought to be a wonderfully good one to warrant the methods he has taken to compa&s;s it. If the facts and rea&s;onings in this piece are admitted, it is all over with us. The conti|nuance of our tranquillity depends upon the compa&s;&s;ion of our rivals. Unable to &s;ecure to our&s;elves the advantages of peace, we are at the &s;ame time utterly unfit for war. It is impo&s;&s;ible, if this &s;tate of things be credited abroad, that we can have any alliance; all nations will &s;ly from &s;o dangerous a connection, le&s;t, in&s;tead of being partakers of our &s;trength, they &s;hould only become &s;harers in our ruin. If it is believed at home, all that firmne&s;s of mind, and dignified national courage, which u&s;ed to
<PB N="5" REF="6">
be the great &s;upport of this i&s;le again&s;t the powers of the world, mu&s;t melt away, and fail within us.</P>
<P>In &s;uch a &s;tate of things can it be ami&s;s, if I aim at holding out &s;ome comfort to the nation; another &s;ort of comfort indeed, than that which this writer provides for it; a comfort, not from its phy&s;ician, but from its con&s;titution; if I attempt to &s;hew that all the arguments upon which he founds the decay of that con&s;titution, and the nece&s;&s;ity of that phy|&s;ician, are vain and frivolous? I will follow the author clo&s;ely in his own long career, through the war, the peace, the finances, our trade, and our foreign politicks: not for the &s;ake of the particular mea&s;ures, which he di&s;cu&s;&s;es; that can be of no u&s;e; they are all decided; their good is all enjoyed, or their evil incurred: but for the &s;ake of the principles of war, peace, trade, and finances. The&s;e principles are of infinite mo|ment. They mu&s;t come again and again under con&s;ideration; and it imports the public, of all things, that tho&s;e of its mini&s;ter be enlarged, and ju&s;t, and well confirmed upon all the&s;e &s;ubjects. What notions this author entertains, we &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently; notions in my opinion very irrational, and extremely dangerous; and which, if they &s;hould crawl from pamphlets into coun&s;els, and be realized from private &s;peculation into national mea&s;ures, cannot fail of ha&s;tening and compleating our ruin.</P>
<P>This author, after having paid his compliment to the &s;hewy appearances of the late war in our favour, is in the utmo&s;t ha&s;te to tell you that the&s;e appearances were <HI>fallacious,</HI> that they were no more than an <HI>impo&s;ition.&mdash;</HI> I fear I mu&s;t trouble the reader with a pretty long quotation, in order to &s;et before him the more clearly this author's peculiar way of conceiving and rea&s;oning:</P>
<P><Q>Happily (the K.) was then advi&s;ed by mini&s;ters, who did not &s;uffer them&s;elves to be dazzled by the glare of brilliant appearances; but, knowing them to be <HI>fallacious,</HI> they wi&s;ely re&s;olved to profit of their &s;plendour before our enemies &s;hould al&s;o <HI>di&s;cover the impo&s;ition.&mdash;</HI> The increa&s;e in the exports was found to have been occa&s;ioned chiefly by the demands of <HI>our own fleets and armies,</HI> and, in&s;tead of bringing wealth to the nation, were to be paid for by oppre&s;&s;ive taxes upon the people of England. While the Briti&s;h &s;eamen were con&s;uming on board our men of war and privateers, &s;oreign &s;hips and foreign &s;eamen were employed in the tran&s;portation of our merchandize; and the car|rying trade, &s;o great a &s;ource of wealth and marine, <HI>was intirely engro&s;&s;ed by the neutral nations.</HI> The number of Briti&s;h &s;hips annually arriving in our ports was reduced to 1756 &s;ail, containing 92.559 tons, on a medium of the &s;ix years war, compared with the &s;ix years of peace pre|ceding it.&mdash;The conque&s;t of the Havannah bad, indeed, &s;topped the remittance of &s;pecie from Mexico to Spain; but it had not enabled
<PB N="6" REF="7">
England to &s;eize it: on the contrary, our merchants &s;uffered by the detention of the galleons, as their <HI>corre&s;pondents in Spain were di&s;abled from paying them for their goods &s;ent to America. The lo&s;s of the trade to Old Spain was a farther bar to an influx of &s;pecie;</HI> and the attempt upon Portugal had not only deprived us of an import of bullion from thence, but the payment of our troops employed in its defence was a fre&s;h drain opened for the diminution of our circulating &s;pecie.&mdash;The high premiums given for new loans had &s;unk the price of the old &s;tock near a third of its original value, &s;o that the purcha&s;ers had an obliga|tion from the &s;tate to repay them with an addition of 33 <HI>per cent.</HI> to their capital. Every new loan required new taxes to be impo&s;ed; new taxes mu&s;t add to the price of our manufactures, <HI>and le&s;&s;en their con&s;umption among foreigners.</HI> The decay of our trade mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily <HI>occa&s;ion a decrea&s;e of the public revenue;</HI> and a deficiency of our funds mu&s;t either be made up by fre&s;h taxes, which would only add to the calamity, or our national credit mu&s;t be de&s;troyed, by &s;hewing the public creditors the inability of the nation to repay them their principal money.&mdash;Bounties had already been given for recruits which exceeded the year's wages of the plowman and reaper; and as the&s;e were exhau&s;ted, and <HI>hu&s;bandry &s;tood &s;till for want of hands,</HI> the manu|facturers were next to be tempted to quit the anvil and the loom by higher offers.<HI>&mdash;France, bankrupt France, had no &s;uch calamities impend|ing over her; her di&s;tre&s;&s;es were great, but they were immediate and tem|porary; her want of credit pre&s;erved her from a great increa&s;e of debt, and the lo&s;s of her ultra-marine dominions le&s;&s;ened her expences. Her colonies had, indeed, put them&s;elves into the hands of the Engli&s;h; but the property of her &s;ubjects had been pre&s;erved by capitulations, and a way opened for making her tho&s;e remittances, which the war had before &s;u&s;pended, with as much &s;ecurity as in time of peace.&mdash;</HI> Her armies in Germany had been hitherto prevented from &s;eizing upon Hanover; but they continued to encamp on the &s;ame ground on which the fir&s;t battle was fought; and, as it mu&s;t ever happen from the policy of that government, <HI>the la&s;t troops &s;he &s;ent into the field were always found to be the be&s;t, and her frequent lo&s;&s;es only &s;erved to fill her regiments with better &s;oldiers. The conque&s;t of Hanover became therefore every campaign more probable.</HI> It is to be noted, that the French troops received &s;ub&s;i&s;tence only, for the la&s;t three years of the war; and that although large arrears were due to them at its conclu&s;ion, the charge was the le&s;s during its con|tinuance <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">P. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</NOTE></Q></P>

If any one be willing to &s;ee to how much greater lengths the author carries the&s;e ideas, he will recur to the book. This is &s;ufficient for a &s;peci|men of his manner of thinking. I believe one reflection uniformly ob|trudes it&s;elf upon every reader of the&s;e paragraphs. For what purpo&s;e in any cau&s;e &s;hall we hereafter contend with France? can we ever flat|ter our&s;elves that we &s;hall wage a more &s;ucce&s;sful war? If, on our part, in a war the mo&s;t pro&s;perous we ever carried on, by &s;ea and by land, and in every part of the globe, attended with the unparalleled circum&s;tance of an immen&s;e increa&s;e of trade and augmentation of re|venue; if a continued &s;eries of di&s;appointments, di&s;graces, and de|feats, followed by public bankruptcy on the part of France, if all the&s;e &s;till leave her a gainer on the whole balance, will it not be downright phrenzy in us ever to look her in the face again, or to contend with her any, even the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential points, &s;ince victory and defeat, though by different ways equally conduct us to our ruin? Subjection to France without a &s;truggle will indeed be le&s;s for our honour, but on every prin|ciple of our author it mu&s;t be more for our advantage. According to his repre&s;entation of things, the que&s;tion is only concerning the mo&s;t ea&s;y fall. France had not di&s;covered, our &s;tate&s;man tells us, at the end of that war the triumphs of defeat, and the re&s;ources which are derived from bankruptcy. For my poor part, I do not altogether wonder at their blind|ne&s;s. But the Engli&s;h mini&s;ters &s;aw further. Our author has at length let foreigners al&s;o into the &s;ecret, and made them altogether as wi&s;e as our|&s;elves. It is their own fault if <HI>(vulgato imperii arcano)</HI> they are impo&s;ed upon any longer. They now are apprized of the &s;entiments which the great candidate for the government of this great empire entertains; and they will act accordingly. They are taught our weakne&s;s and their own ad|vantages.</P>
<P>He tells the world, that if France carries on the war again&s;t us in Germany, every lo&s;s &s;he &s;u&s;tains contributes to the atchievement of her <MILESTONE N="9, 10." UNIT="P."> conque&s;t. If her armies are three years unpaid, &s;he is the le&s;s exhau&s;ted by expence. If her credit is de&s;troyed, &s;he is the le&s;s oppre&s;&s;ed with debt. If her troops are cut to pieces, they will by her policy (and a wonderful policy it is) be improved, and will be &s;upplied with much better men. If the war is carried on in the colonies, he tells them that the lo&s;s of her ultramarine dominions le&s;&s;ens her expences, and encrea&s;es <MILESTONE N="1" UNIT="P."> her remittances:

The only way which the author's principles leave for our e&s;cape, is to rever&s;e our condition into that of France, and to take her lo&s;ing cards into our hands. But, though his principles drive him to it, his politicks will not &s;uffer him to walk on this ground. Talking at our ea&s;e and of other countries, we may bear to be diverted with &s;uch &s;peculations; but in England we &s;hall never be taught to look upon the annihilation of our trade, the ruin of our credit, the defeat of our armies, and the lo&s;s of our ultramarine dominions (whatever the author may think of them), to be the high road to pro&s;perity and greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>The reader does not, I hope, imagine that I mean &s;eriou&s;ly to &s;et about the refutation of the&s;e uningenious paradoxes and reveries without ima|gination. I &s;tate them only that we may di&s;cern a little in the que&s;tions of war and peace, the mo&s;t weighty of all que&s;tions, what is the wi&s;dom of tho&s;e men, who are held out to us as the only hope of an expiring na|tion. The pre&s;ent mini&s;try is indeed of a &s;trange character: at once indolent and di&s;tracted. But if a mini&s;terial &s;y&s;tem &s;hould be formed actuated by &s;uch maxims as are avowed in this piece, the vices of the pre&s;ent mini&s;|try would become their virtues; their indolence would be the greate&s;t of all public benefits, and a di&s;traction that entirely defeated every one of their &s;chemes would be our only &s;ecurity from de&s;truction.</P>
<P>To have &s;tated the&s;e rea&s;onings is enough, I pre&s;ume, to do their bu&s;i|ne&s;s. But they are accompanied with facts and records, which may &s;eem of a little more weight. I tru&s;t however that the facts of this author will be as far from bearing the touch&s;tone, as his arguments. On a little inquiry, they will be found as great an impo&s;ition as the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es they are meant to depreciate; for they are all either fal&s;e or fal|laciou&s;ly applied; or not in the lea&s;t to the purpo&s;e for which they are produced.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t the author, in order to &s;upport his favourite paradox, that our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the French colonies was of no detriment to France, has thought proper to inform us that <Q>they put them&s;elves into the hands of the Engli&s;h.</Q> He u&s;es the &s;ame a&s;&s;ertion, in nearly the &s;ame words, <MILESTONE N="9"> in another place; "Her colonies had put them&s;elves into our hands." <MILESTONE N="6" UNIT="P."> Now, in ju&s;tice not only to fact and common &s;en&s;e, but to the incompara|ble valour and per&s;everance of our military and naval forces thus un|hand&s;omely traduced, I mu&s;t tell this author, that the French colonies did not "put them&s;elves into the hands of the Engli&s;h." They were compelled to &s;ubmit; they were &s;ubdued by dint of Engli&s;h valour. Will the five years war carried on in Canada, in which fell one of the principal hopes of this nation; and all the battles lo&s;t and gained during that anxious period, convince this author of his mi&s;take. Let him in|quire of Sir Jeffery Amher&s;t, under who&s;e conduct that war was
<PB N="9" REF="10">
carried on; of Sir Charles Saunders, who&s;e &s;teadine&s;s and pre&s;ence of mind &s;aved our fleet, and were &s;o eminently &s;erviceable in the whole cour&s;e of the &s;iege of Quebec; of General Monkton, who was &s;hot through the body there, whether France <Q>put her colonies into the hands of the Engli&s;h?</Q></P>
<P>Though he has made no exception, yet I would be liberal to him; per|haps he means to confine him&s;elf to her colonies in the We&s;t Indies. But &s;urely it will fare as ill with him there as in North America, whil&s;t we remember that in our fir&s;t attempt on Martinico we were actually de|feated; that it was three months before we reduced Guadaloupe; and that the conque&s;t of the Havannah was atchieved by the highe&s;t con|duct, aided by circum&s;tances of the greate&s;t good fortune. He knows the expence both of men and trea&s;ure at which we bought that place. However, if it had &s;o plea&s;ed the peace-makers, it was no dear pur|cha&s;e; for it was deci&s;ive of the fortune of the war and the terms of the treaty: the duke of Nivernois thought &s;o; France, England, Europe, con&s;idered it in that light; all the world except the then friends of the then mini&s;try, who wept for our victories, and were in ha&s;te to get rid of the burthen of our conque&s;ts. This author knows that France did not put tho&s;e colonies into the hands of England; but he well knows who did put the mo&s;t valuable of them into the hands of France.</P>
<P>In the next place our author is plea&s;ed to con&s;ider the conque&s;t of the&s;e colonies in no other light than as a convenience for the remittances to <MILESTONE N="9" UNIT="P."> France, which he a&s;&s;erts that the war had before &s;u&s;pended, but for which a way was opened (by our conque&s;t) as &s;ecure as in time of peace. I charitably hope he knows nothing of the &s;ubject. I referred him lately to our commanders for the re&s;i&s;tance of the French colonies; I now wi&s;h he would apply to our cu&s;tom-hou&s;e entries, and our merchants, for the advantages which we derived from them.</P>
<P>In 1761, there was no entry of goods from any of the conquered places but Guadaloupe; in that year, it &s;tood thus:

Be&s;ides, I find in the account of bullion imported and brought to the Bank, that, during the period in which the intercour&s;e with the Havannah was open, we received at that one &s;hop, in trea&s;ure, from that one place, &pound;. 559.810; in the year 1763, &pound;. 389.450; &s;o that the import from the&s;e places in that year amounted to &pound;. 1.395.300.</P>
<P>On this &s;tate the reader will ob&s;erve, that I take the imports from, and not the exports to, the&s;e conque&s;ts, as the mea&s;ure of the advantages which we derived from them. I do &s;o for rea&s;ons which will be &s;omewhat wor|thy the attention of &s;uch readers as are fond of this &s;pecies of inquiry. I &s;ay therefore I choo&s;e the import article, as the be&s;t, and indeed the only &s;tandard we can have, of the value of the We&s;t India trade. Our ex|port entry does not comprehend the greate&s;t trade we carry on with any of the We&s;t India i&s;lands, the &s;ale of negroes; nor does it give any idea of two other advantages we draw from them; the remittances for money &s;pent here, and the payment of part of the balance of the North American trade. It is therefore quite ridiculous, to &s;trike a balance merely on the face of an exce&s;s of imports and exports, in that commerce; though, in mo&s;t foreign branches, it is, on the whole, the be&s;t method. If we &s;hould take that &s;tandard, it would appear, that the balance with our own i&s;lands is, annually, &s;everal hundred thou&s;and pounds again&s;t this country <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><P><TABLE>

In this, which is the common way of &s;tating the balance, it will appear upwards of two mil|lions again&s;t us; which is ridiculous.</P></NOTE>. Such is its a&s;pect on the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e entries; but we know the direct contrary to be the fact. We know that the We&s;t Indians are always
<PB N="11" REF="12">
indebted to our merchants, and that the value of every &s;hilling of We&s;t India produce is Engli&s;h property. So that our import from them, and not our export, ought always to be con&s;idered as their true value; and this corrective ought to be applied to all general balances of our trade, which are formed on the ordinary principles.</P>
<P>If po&s;&s;ible, this was more emphatically true of the French We&s;t India i&s;lands, whil&s;t they continued in our hands. That none, or only a very contemptible part, of the value of this produce, could be remitted to France, the author will &s;ee, perhaps with unwillingne&s;s, but with the cleare&s;t conviction, if he con&s;iders, that in the year 1763, <HI>after we had cea&s;ed to export</HI> to the i&s;les of Guadaloupe and Martinico, and to the Ha|vannah, and after the colonies were free, to &s;end all their produce to Old France and Spain, if they had any remittance to make; he will &s;ee, that we imported from the&s;e places, in that year, to the amount of &pound;. 1.395.300. So far was the whole annual produce of the&s;e i&s;lands from being adequate to the payments of their annual call upon us, that this mighty additional importation was nece&s;&s;ary, though not quite &s;uf|ficient, to di&s;charge the debts contracted in the few years we held them. The property, therefore, of their whole produce, was ours, not only during the war, but even for more than a year after the peace. The author, I hope, will not again venture upon &s;o ra&s;h and di&s;couraging a propo&s;ition, concerning the nature and effect of the&s;e conque&s;ts, as to call them a convenience to the remittances of France; he &s;ees by this account, that what he a&s;&s;erts, is not only without foundation, but even impo&s;&s;ible to be true.</P>
<P>As to our trade at that time, he labours with all his might to repre&s;ent it as ab&s;olutely ruined, or on the very edge of ruin. Indeed, as u&s;ual with him, he is often as equivocal in his expre&s;&s;ion, as he is clear in his de&s;ign. Sometimes he more than in&s;inuates a decay of our commerce in that war; &s;ometimes he admits an encrea&s;e of exports; but it is in order to depreciate the advantages we might appear to derive from that encrea&s;e, whenever it &s;hould come to be proved again&s;t him. He tells you, <MILESTONE N="6" UNIT="P."> <Q>that it was chiefly occa&s;ioned by the demands of our own fleets and armies, and in&s;tead of bringing wealth to the nation, were to be paid for by oppre&s;&s;ive taxes upon the people of England.</Q> Never was any thing more de&s;titute of foundation. It might be proved with the greate&s;t ea&s;e, from the nature and quality of the goods exported, as well as from the &s;ituation of the places to which our merchandi&s;e was &s;ent, and which the war could no ways affect, that the &s;upply of our fleets and armies could not have been the cau&s;e of this wonderful encrea&s;e of trade: its cau&s;e was evident to the whole world; the ruin of the trade of France, and our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her colonies.

Here is the &s;tate of our trade in 1761, compared with a very good year of profound peace: both are taken from the authentic entries of the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e. How the author can contrive to make this encrea&s;e of the export of Engli&s;h produce agree with his account of the dreadful want of hands in England, p. 9, unle&s;s he &s;uppo&s;es manufactures to be made without hands, I really do not &s;ee. It is painful to be &s;o frequently obliged to &s;et this author right in matters of fact. This &s;tate will fully refute all that he has &s;aid or in&s;inuated upon the difficulties and decay of our trade, p. 6, 7, and 9.</NOTE>; and he will form on that account &s;ome judgment of the authors candour or information.</P>
<P>Admit however that a great part of our export, which is the remote&s;t in the world from fact, was owing to our &s;upply of our fleets and armies; was it not &s;omething?&mdash;was it not peculiarly fortunate for a nation, that &s;he was able from her own bo&s;om to contribute largely to the &s;upply of her armies militating in &s;o many di&s;tant countries? The author allows that France did not enjoy the &s;ame advantages. But it is remark|able throughout his whole book, that tho&s;e circum&s;tances which have ever been con&s;idered as great benefits, and deci&s;ive proofs of national &s;u|periority, are, when in our hands, taken either in diminution of &s;ome other apparent advantage, or even &s;ometimes as po&s;itive misfortunes. The opticks of that politician mu&s;t be of a &s;trange conformation, who be|holds every thing in this di&s;torted light.</P>
<P>So far as to our trade. With regard to our navigation, he is &s;till more unea&s;y at our &s;ituation, and &s;till more fallacious in his &s;tate of it. In his text, he affirms it "to have been <HI>entirely</HI> engro&s;&s;ed by the neutral nations <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">P. 7. See al&s;o p. 13.</NOTE>." This he a&s;&s;erts roundly and boldly, and without the lea&s;t concern; al|though it co&s;t no more than a &s;ingle glance of the eye upon his own margin to &s;ee the full refutation of this a&s;&s;ertion. His own account proves again&s;t him, that in the year 1761 the Briti&s;h &s;hipping amounted to 527,557 tons&mdash;the foreign to no more than 180,102. The medium
<PB N="13" REF="14">
of his &s;ix years Briti&s;h, 2,449,555 tons&mdash;foreign only, 906,690. This &s;tate (his own) demon&s;trates that the neutral nations did not <HI>entirely engro&s;s our navigation.</HI></P>
<P>I am willing from a &s;train of candour to admit that this author &s;peaks at random; that he is only &s;lovenly and inaccurate, and not fallacious. In matters of account, however, this want of care is not excu&s;able: and the difference between neutral nations entirely engro&s;&s;ing our navi|gation, and being only &s;ub&s;idiary to a va&s;tly augmented trade, makes a mo&s;t material difference to his argument. From that principle of fair|ne&s;s, though the author &s;peaks otherwi&s;e, I am willing to &s;uppo&s;e he means no more than that our navigation had &s;o declined as to alarm us with the probable lo&s;s of this valuable object. I &s;hall however &s;hew, that his whole propo&s;ition, whatever modifications he may plea&s;e to give it, is without foundation; that our navigation was not decrea&s;ed; that on the contrary it was greatly encrea&s;ed in the war; that it was encrea&s;ed by the war; and that it was probable the &s;ame cau&s;e would continue to augment it to a &s;till greater height; to what an height it is hard to &s;ay, had our &s;ucce&s;s continued.</P>
<P>But fir&s;t I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, I am much le&s;s &s;olicitous whether his fact be true or no, than whether his principle is well e&s;tabli&s;hed. Ca&s;es are dead things, principles are living and productive. I then affirm that, if in time of war our trade had the good fortune to encrea&s;e, and at the &s;ame time a large, nay the large&s;t, proportion of carriage had been en|gro&s;&s;ed by neutral nations, it ought not in it&s;elf to have been con&s;idered as a circum&s;tance of di&s;tre&s;s. War is a time of inconvenience to trade; in ge|neral it mu&s;t be &s;traitened, and mu&s;t find its way as it can. It is often happy for nations that they are able to call in neutral navigation. They all aim at it. France endeavoured at it, but could not compa&s;s it. Will this au|thor &s;ay, that, in a war with Spain, &s;uch a convenience would not be of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, that it would not be the mo&s;t gro&s;s of all follies to refu&s;e it?</P>
<P>In the next place, his method of &s;tating a medium of &s;ix years of war, and &s;ix years of peace, to decide this que&s;tion, is altogether unfair. To &s;ay, in derogation of the advantages of a war, that navigation is not equal to what it was in time of peace, is what hitherto has never been heard of. No war ever bore that te&s;t but the war which he &s;o bitterly laments. One may lay it down as a maxim, that an average e&s;timate of an object in a &s;teady cour&s;e of ri&s;ing or of falling, mu&s;t in its nature be an unfair one; more particularly if the cau&s;e of the ri&s;e or fall be vi&s;ible, and its continuance in any degree probable. Average e&s;timates are never ju&s;t but when the object fluctuates; and no rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned why it &s;hould not continue &s;till to fluctuate. The author chu&s;es to allow nothing
<PB N="14" REF="15">
at all for this: he has taken an average of &s;ix years of the war. He knew, for every body knows, that the fir&s;t three years were on the whole rather un&s;ucce&s;sful; and that, in con&s;equence of this ill &s;ucce&s;s, trade &s;unk, and navigation declined with it; but <HI>that grand delu&s;ion</HI> of the three la&s;t years turned the &s;cale in our favour. At the beginning of that war (as in the commencement of every war), traders were &s;truck with a &s;ort of pa|nick. Many went out of the freighting bu&s;ine&s;s. But by degrees, as the war continued the terror wore off; the danger came to be bet|ter appreciated, and better provided again&s;t; our trade was car|ried on in large fleets, under regular conduct, and with great &s;afety. The freighting bu&s;ine&s;s revived. The &s;hips were fewer, but much larger; and though the number decrea&s;ed, the tonnage was va&s;tly aug|mented; in&s;omuch that in 1761 the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;hipping had ri&s;en by the author's own account to 527.557 tons.&mdash;In the la&s;t year he has given us of the peace it amounted to no more than 494.772; that is, in the la&s;t year of the war it was 32.785 tons more than in the corre&s;pondent year of his peace average. No year of the peace exceeded it except one, and that but little.</P>
<P>The fair account of the matter is this. Our trade had, as we have ju&s;t &s;een, encrea&s;ed to &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing a degree in 1761, as to employ Briti&s;h and foreign &s;hips to the amount of 707.659 tons, which is 139.500 more than we employed in the la&s;t year of the peace.&mdash;Thus our trade en|crea&s;ed nearly a fifth; our Briti&s;h navigation had encrea&s;ed likewi&s;e with this a&s;toni&s;hing increa&s;e of trade, but was not able to keep pace with it; and we added about 60,000 ton more of foreign &s;hipping than had been employed in the la&s;t year of peace.&mdash;Whatever happened to our &s;hipping in the former years of the war, this would be no true &s;tate of the ca&s;e at the time of the treaty. If we had lo&s;t &s;omething in the beginning, we had then recovered, and more than recovered, all our lo&s;&s;es. Here is the &s;ubject of the doleful complaints of the author, that <HI>the carrying trade was wholly engro&s;&s;ed by the neutral nations.</HI></P>
<P>I have done fairly, and even very moderately, in taking this year, and not his average, as the &s;tandard of what might be expected in future, had the war continued. The author will be compelled to allow it, unle&s;s he undertakes to &s;hew; fir&s;t, that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Canada, Martinico, Guadaloupe, Granada, the Havannah, the Philippines, the whole Afri|can trade, the whole Ea&s;t India trade, and the whole Newfoundland fi&s;h|ery, had no certain inevitable tendency to increa&s;e the Briti&s;h &s;hipping; unle&s;s, in the &s;econd place, he can prove that tho&s;e trades were, or might by law or indulgence, be carried on in foreign ve&s;&s;els: and unle&s;s, third|ly, he can demon&s;tate that the premium of in&s;urance on Briti&s;h &s;hips was ri&s;ing as the war continued. He can prove not one of the&s;e points.
<PB N="15" REF="16">
I will &s;hew him a fact more, that is mortal to his a&s;&s;ertions. It is the &s;tate of our &s;hipping in 1762. The author had his rea&s;ons for &s;topping &s;hort at the preceding year. It would have appeared, had he proceeded farther, that our tonnage was in a cour&s;e of uniform augmentation, owing to the freights derived from our foreign conque&s;ts, and to the perfect &s;e|curity of our navigation from our clear and decided &s;uperiority at &s;ea. This, I &s;ay, would have appeared from the &s;tate of the two years:

</TABLE>
The two be&s;t years of the peace were in no degree equal to the&s;e. Much of the navigation of 1763 was al&s;o owing to the war; this is manife&s;t from the large part of it employed in the carriage from the ceded i&s;lands, with which the communication &s;till continued open. No &s;uch circum&s;tances of glory and advantage ever attended upon a war. Too happy will be our lot, if we &s;hould again be forced into a war, to behold any thing that &s;hall re&s;emble them; and if we were not then the bet|ter for them, it is not in the ordinary cour&s;e of God's providence to mend our condition.</P>
<P>In vain does the author declaim on the high premiums given for the loans during that war. His long note &s;welled with calculations (even &s;uppo&s;ing the mo&s;t inaccurate of all calculations to be ju&s;t) on that <MILESTONE N="8" UNIT="P."> &s;ubject would be entirely thrown away, did it not &s;erve to rai&s;e a won|derful opinion of his financial &s;kill in tho&s;e who are not le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed than edified, when, with a &s;olemn face and my&s;terious air, they are told that two and two make four. For what el&s;e do we learn from this note? That the more expence that is incurred by a nation, the more money will be required to defray it; that, in proportion to the continuance of that expence, will be the continuance of borrowing; that the increa&s;e of bor|rowing and the increa&s;e of debt will go hand in hand; and la&s;tly, that the more money you want, the harder it will be to get it; and that the &s;carcity of the commodity will enhance the price. Who ever doubted the truth, or the in&s;ignificance, of the&s;e propo&s;itions? what do they prove? that war is expen&s;ive, and peace de&s;irable. They contain nothing more than a common-place again&s;t war; the ea&s;ie&s;t of all topics. To bring them home to his purpo&s;e, he ought to have &s;hewn, that our enemies had money upon better terms; which he has not &s;hewn, neither can he. I &s;hall &s;peak more fully to this point in another place. He ought to have &s;hewn, that the money they rai&s;ed, upon whatever terms, had procured them a more lucrative return. He knows that our expenditure purcha&s;ed commerce and conque&s;t; theirs acquired nothing but defeat and bankruptey.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="17">
Thus the author has laid down his ideas on the &s;ubject of war. Next follow tho&s;e he entertains on that of peace. The treaty of Paris upon the whole has his approbation. Indeed, if his account of the war be ju&s;t, he might have &s;pared him&s;elf all further trouble. The re&s;t is drawn on as an inevitable conclu&s;ion. If the Hou&s;e of Bourbon had the advantage, <MILESTONE N="12, 13" UNIT="P."> &s;he mu&s;t give the law; and the peace, though it were much wor&s;e than it is, had &s;till been a good one. But as the world is yet <HI>deluded</HI> on the &s;tate of that war, other arguments are nece&s;&s;ary; and the au|thor has in my opinion very ill &s;upplied them. He tells of many things we have got, and of which he has made out a kind of bill. This matter may be brought within a very narrow compa&s;s, if we come to con&s;ider the requi&s;ites of a good peace under &s;ome plain di&s;|tinct heads. I apprehend they may be reduced to the&s;e: 1. &s;tability; 2. indemnification; 3. alliance.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t, the author more than ob&s;curely hints in &s;everal places; that he thinks the peace not likely to la&s;t. However, he does furni&s;h a &s;e|curity; a &s;ecurity, in any light, I fear, but in&s;ufficient; on his hypothe&s;is &s;urely a very odd one. <Q>By &s;tipulating for the entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <MILESTONE N="17" UNIT="P."> continent, (&s;ays he) the re&s;tored French i&s;lands are become in &s;ome mea&s;ure dependent on the Briti&s;h empire, and the good faith of France in ob&s;erving the treaty is guaranted by the value at which &s;he e&s;timates their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</Q> This author &s;oon grows weary of his principles. They &s;eldom la&s;t him for two pages together. When the advan|tages of the war were to be depreciated, then the lo&s;s of the ul|tramarine colonies lightened the expences of France, facilitated her remittances, and therefore <HI>her coloni&s;ts put them into our hands.</HI> Ac|cording to this author's &s;y&s;tem, the actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e colo|nies ought to give us little or no advantage in the negotiation for peace; and yet the chance of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them on a future occa&s;ion gives a perfect &s;ecurity for the pre&s;ervation of that peace.

The author &s;ets very little by conque&s;ts; I &s;uppo&s;e it is becau&s;e he <MILESTONE N="12, 13." UNIT="P."> makes them &s;o very lightly. On this &s;ubject he &s;peaks with the greate&s;t certainty imaginable. We have, according to him, nothing to do, but to go and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, whenever we think proper, of the French and Spani&s;h &s;ettlements. It were better that he had examined a little what advantage the peace gave us towards the inva&s;ion of the&s;e colonies, which we did not po&s;&s;e&s;s before the peace. It would not have been ami&s;s if he had con&s;ulted the public experience, and our commanders, concern|ing the ab&s;olute certainty of tho&s;e conque&s;ts on which he is plea&s;ed to found our &s;ecurity. And if, after all, he &s;hould have di&s;covered them to be &s;o very &s;ure, and &s;o very ea&s;y, he might, at lea&s;t, to pre&s;erve con|&s;i&s;tency, have looked a few pages back, and (no unplea&s;ing thing to him) li&s;tened to him&s;elf, where he &s;ays, <Q>that the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful enterpri&s;e <MILESTONE N="6" UNIT="P."> could not compen&s;ate to the nation for the wa&s;te of its people, by carrying on war in unhealthy climates.</Q> A po&s;ition which he repeats again, p. 9. So that, according to him&s;elf, his &s;ecurity is not worth the &s;uit. According to fact, he has only a chance, God knows what a chance, of getting at it. And therefore, according to rea&s;on, the giving up the mo&s;t valuable of all po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, in hopes to conquer them back, under any advantage of &s;ituation, is the mo&s;t ridiculous &s;ecurity that ever was imagined for the peace of a nation. It is true his friends did not give up Canada; they could not give up every thing; let us make the mo&s;t of it. We have Canada, we know its value. We have not the French any longer to fight in North America; and, from this circum|&s;tance, we derive con&s;iderable advantages. But here let me re&s;t a little. The author touches upon a &s;tring, which &s;ounds under his fingers but a tre|mulous and melancholy note.&mdash;North America was once indeed a great &s;trength to this nation, in opportunity of ports, in &s;hips, in provi&s;ions, in men. We &s;ound her a &s;ound, an active, a vigorous member of the em|pire. I hope, by wi&s;e management, &s;he will again become &s;o. But one of our capital pre&s;ent misfortunes is, her di&s;content and di&s;|obedience. To which of the author's favourites this di&s;content is owing, we all know but too &s;ufficiently.&mdash;It would be a di&s;mal event, if this foundation of his &s;ecurity, and indeed of all our public &s;trength, &s;hould, in reality, become our weakne&s;s: and if all the powers of this empire, which ought to fall with a compacted weight upon the head of our enemies, &s;hould be di&s;&s;ipated and di&s;tracted by a jealous vigilance, or by ho&s;tile attempts upon one another. Ten Canadas cannot re&s;tore that &s;ecurity for the peace, and for every thing valuable to this country, which we have lo&s;t along with the affection and the obedience of our colonies. He is the wi&s;e mini&s;ter, he is the true friend to Britain, who &s;hall be able to re&s;tore it.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="19">
To return to the &s;ecurity for the peace. The author tells us, that <MILESTONE N="12" UNIT="P."> the original great purpo&s;es of the war were more than accompli&s;hed by the treaty. Surely he has experience and reading enough to know that, in the cour&s;e of a war, events may happen, that render its original very far from being its principal purpo&s;e. This original may dwindle by circum&s;tances &s;o as to become not a purpo&s;e of the &s;econd or even the third magnitude. I tru&s;t this is &s;o obvious, that it will not be nece&s;&s;ary to put ca&s;es for its illu&s;tration. In that war, as &s;oon as Spain entered into the quarrel, the &s;ecurity of North-America was no longer the &s;ole nor the foremo&s;t object. The <HI>Family compact</HI> had been I know not how long before in agitation. But then it was that we &s;aw produced into daylight and action the mo&s;t odious and mo&s;t formidable of all the con&s;piracies again&s;t the liberties of Europe, that ever has been framed. The war with Spain was the fir&s;t fruits of that league; and a &s;ecurity again&s;t that league ought to have been the fundamental point of a pacification with the powers who compo&s;e it. We had materials in our hands to have con&s;tructed that &s;ecurity in &s;uch a manner as never to be &s;haken. But how did the virtuous and able men of our author labour for this great end? They took no one &s;tep towards it. On the contrary they countenanced, and indeed, as far as it depended on them, recognized it in all its parts; for our plenipotentiary treated with tho&s;e who acted for the two crowns, as if they had been different mini&s;ters of the &s;ame monarch. The Spani&s;h mini&s;ter received his in&s;tructions, not from Ma|drid, but from Ver&s;ailles.</P>
<P>This was not hid from our mini&s;ters at home, and the di&s;covery ought to have alarmed them, if the good of their country had been the object of their anxiety. They could not but have &s;een that the whole Spani&s;h mo|narchy was melted down into the cabinet of Ver&s;ailles. But they thought this circum&s;tance an advantage; as it enabled them to go through with their work the more expeditiou&s;ly. Expedition was every thing to them; becau&s;e France might happen during a protracted negotiation to di&s;cover the great impo&s;ition of our victories.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame &s;pirit they negotiated the terms of the peace. If it were thought advi&s;able not to take any po&s;itive &s;ecurity from Spain, the mo&s;t ob|vious principles of policy dictated that the burthen of the ce&s;&s;ions ought to fall upon France; and that every thing which was of grace and favour &s;hould be given to Spain. Spain could not, on her part, have executed a capital article in the family compact, which obliged her to compen&s;ate the lo&s;&s;es of France. At lea&s;t &s;he could not do it in America; for &s;he was expre&s;sly precluded by the treaty of Utrecht from ceding any territory or giving any advantage in trade to that power. What did our mini&s;ters? They took from Spain the territory of Florida, an object of no value except to &s;hew
<PB N="19" REF="20">
our di&s;po&s;itions to be quite equal at lea&s;t towards both powers; and they enabled France to compen&s;ate Spain by the gift of Loui&s;iana; loading us with all the har&s;hne&s;s, leaving the act of kindne&s;s with France, and opening thereby a door to the fulfilling of this the mo&s;t con&s;olidating article of the family compact. Accordingly that dangerous league, thus abetted and authorized by the Engli&s;h mini&s;try without an attempt to invalidate it in any way, or in any of its parts, exi&s;ts to this hour; and has grown &s;tronger and &s;tronger, every hour of its exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>As to the &s;econd component of a good peace, <HI>compen&s;ation,</HI> I have but little trouble; the author has &s;aid nothing upon that head. He has nothing to &s;ay. After a war of &s;uch expence, this ought to have been a capital con&s;ideration. But on what he has been &s;o prudently &s;ilent, I think it is right to &s;peak plainly. All our new acqui&s;itions together, at this time, &s;carce afford matter of revenue either at home or abroad, &s;ufficient to defray the expence of their e&s;tabli&s;h|ments; not one &s;hilling towards the reduction of our debt. Guada|loupe or Martinico alone would have given us material aid; much in the way of duties, much in the way of trade and navigation. A good mini&s;try would have con&s;idered how a renewal of the <HI>A&s;&s;iento</HI> might have been obtained. We had as much right to a&s;k it at the treaty of Paris as at the treaty of Utrecht. We had incomparably more in our hands to purcha&s;e it. Floods of trea&s;ure would have poured into this kingdom from &s;uch a &s;ource; and, under proper management, no &s;mall part of it would have taken a public direction, and have fructified an exhau&s;ted exchequer.</P>
<P>If this gentleman's hero of finance, in&s;tead of flying from a treaty, which though he now defends, he could not approve, and would not oppo&s;e, if he, in&s;tead of &s;hifting into an office, which removed him from the ma|nufacture of the treaty, had, by his credit with the then great director, acquired for us the&s;e, or any of the&s;e objects, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Guadaloupe or Martinique, or of the renewal of the <HI>A&s;&s;iento,</HI> he might have held his head high in his country; becau&s;e he would have performed real &s;ervice; ten thou&s;and times more real &s;ervice, than all the oeconomy of which this writer is perpetually talking, or all the little tricks of finance, which the experte&s;t juggler of the trea&s;ury can practi&s;e, could amount to in a thou&s;and years. But the occa&s;ion is lo&s;t; the time is gone, per|haps, for ever.</P>
<P>As to the third requi&s;ite, <HI>alliance,</HI> there too the author is &s;ilent. What &s;trength of that kind did they acquire? They got no one new ally; they &s;tript the enemy of not a &s;ingle old one. They di&s;gu&s;ted (how ju&s;tly, or un|ju&s;tly, matters not) every ally we had; and, from that time to this, we &s;tand friendle&s;s in Europe. But of this naked condition of their country, I
<PB N="20" REF="21">
know &s;ome people are not a&s;hamed. They have their &s;y&s;tem of politics; our ance&s;tors grew great by another. In this manner the&s;e virtuous men concluded the peace; and their practice is only con&s;onant to their theory.</P>
<P>Many things more might be ob&s;erved on this curious head of our au|thor's &s;peculations. But, taking leave of what the writer &s;ays in his &s;e|rious part, if he be &s;erious in any part, I &s;hall only ju&s;t point out a piece of his plea&s;antry. No man, I believe, ever denied that the time for making peace is that in which the be&s;t terms may be obtained. But what that time is, together with the u&s;e that has been made of it, we are to judge by &s;eeing whether terms, adequate to our advantages, and to our nece&s;&s;ities, have been actually obtained.&mdash;Here is the pinch of the que&s;tion, and to which the author ought to have &s;et his &s;houlders in ear|ne&s;t. In&s;tead of doing this, he &s;lips out of the harne&s;s by a je&s;t; and &s;neeringly tells us, that, to determine this point, we mu&s;t know the &s;ecrets of the French and Spani&s;h cabinets <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Something however has tran&s;pired in the quarrels among tho&s;e concerned in that tran&s;|action. It &s;eems the <HI>good Genius</HI> of Britain, &s;o much vaunted by our author, did his duty nobly. Whil&s;t we were gaining &s;uch advantages, the court of France was a&s;toni&s;hed at our conce&s;&s;ions. <Q>J'ai apporte &agrave; Ver&s;ailles, il e&s;t vrai, les ratifications du Roi d'Angleterre <HI>&agrave; vo&s;tre grand etonnement, et &agrave; celui de bien d'autres.</HI> Je dois cela an bontes du Roi d'Angleterre, &agrave; celles de Milord Bute, &agrave; Mon&s;. le Comte de Viry, &agrave; Mon&s;. le Due de Nivernois, et &agrave; &s;in a mon &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">avoir faire.</Q> Letters, &amp;c. du Chev. D'Eon, p. 51.</NOTE>, and that parliament was plea&s;ed to approve the treaty of peace without calling for the corre&s;pondence concerning it. How ju&s;t this &s;arca&s;m on that parlia|ment may be, I &s;ay not; but how becoming in the author, I leave it to his friends to determine.</P>
<P>Having thus gone through the que&s;tions of war and peace, the author proceeds to &s;tate our debt, and the intere&s;t which it carried, at the time of the treaty, with the unfairne&s;s and inaccuracy, however, which di&s;tin|gui&s;h all his a&s;&s;ertions, and all his calculations. To detect every fallacy, and rectify every mi&s;take, would be endle&s;s. It will be enough to point out a few of them, in order to &s;hew how un&s;afe it is to place any thing like an implicit tru&s;t in &s;uch a writer.</P>
<P>The intere&s;t of debt contracted during the war, is &s;tated by the author at &pound;. 2. 614. 892. The particulars appear in pages 14 and 15. Among them is &s;tated the unfunded debt, &pound;. 9. 975. 017 &s;uppo&s;ed to carry intere&s;t on a medium at 3 <HI>per cent.</HI> which amounts to &pound;. 299. 250. We are re|ferred to the <HI>Con&s;iderations on the Trade and Finances of the Kingdom,</HI> p. 22, for the particulars of that unfunded debt. Turn to the work, and to the place referred to by the author him&s;elf, if you have a mind to &s;ee a clear detection of a capital fallacy of this article in his account. You will there &s;ee that this unfunded debt con&s;i&s;ts of the nine following ar|ticles; the remaining &s;ub&s;idy to the duke of Brun&s;wick; the remaining
<PB N="21" REF="22">
<HI>dedommagement</HI> to the landgrave of He&s;&s;e; the German demands; the army and ordnance extraordinaries; the deficiencies of grants and funds; Mr. Touchit's claim; the debts due to Nova Scotia and Barbadoes; Ex|chequer bills; and Navy debt. The extreme fallacy of this &s;tate cannot e&s;cape any reader who will be at the pains to compare the intere&s;t money, with which he affirms us to have been loaded, in his <HI>State of the Nation,</HI> with the items of the principal debt to which he refers in his <HI>Con&s;iderations.</HI> The reader mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that of this long li&s;t of nine articles, only two, the Exchequer bills, and part of the Navy debt, carried any intere&s;t at all. The fir&s;t amounted to &pound;. 1. 800. 000; and this undoubtedly carried inter|e&s;t. The whole navy debt indeed amounted to &pound;. 4. 576. 915; but of this only a <HI>part</HI> carried intere&s;t. The author of the <HI>Con&s;iderations,</HI> &amp;c. labours to prove this very point in p. 18; and Mr. G. has always defended him&s;elf upon the &s;ame ground, for the in&s;ufficient provi&s;ion he made for the di&s;|charge of that debt. The reader may &s;ee their own authority for it <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>The navy bills are not due till &s;ix months after they have been i&s;&s;ued; &s;ix months al&s;o of the &s;eamens wages by act of parliament mu&s;t be, and, in con&s;equence of the rules pre&s;cribed by that act, twelve months wages generally, and often much more, are retain|ed; and there has been be&s;ides at all times a large arrear of pay, which, though kept in the account, could never be claimed, the per&s;ons to whom it was due having left neither a&s;&s;ignees nor repre&s;entatives. The preci&s;e amount of &s;uch &s;ums cannot be a&s;certained; but they can hardly be reckoned le&s;s than 13 or 14 hundred thou&s;and pounds. On 31&s;t Dec. 1754, when the navy debt was reduced nearly as low as it could be, it &s;till amount|ed to 1. 296. 567 <HI>l.</HI> 18 <HI>s.</HI> 11 &frac34; <HI>d.</HI> con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of articles which could not then be di&s;|charged; &s;uch articles will be larger now, in proportion to the encrea&s;e of the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment; and an allowance mu&s;t always be made for them in judging of the &s;tate of the navy debt, though they are not di&s;tingui&s;hable in the account. In providing for that which is payable, the principal object of the legi&s;lature is always to di&s;charge the bills for they are the greate&s;t article; they bear an intere&s;t of 4 <HI>per Cent.;</HI> and, when the quan|tity of them is large, they are a heavy incumbrance upon all money tran&s;actions.</Q></P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Mr. G. did in fact provide no more than &pound;. 2. 150. 000 for the di&s;|charge of the&s;e bills in two years. It is much to be wi&s;hed that the&s;e gentlemen would lay their heads together, that they would con&s;ider well this matter, and agree upon &s;omething. For when the &s;canty provi&s;ion made for the unfunded debt is to be vindicated, then we are told it is a very <HI>&s;mall part</HI> of that debt which carries intere&s;t. But when the public &s;tate is to be repre&s;ented in a mi&s;erable condition, and the con&s;equences of the late war to be laid before us in dreadful colours, then we are to be told that the unfunded debt is within a trifle of ten millions, and &s;o large a portion of it carries intere&s;t that we mu&s;t not compute le&s;s than 3 <HI>per cent.</HI> upon the <HI>whole.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1764, parliament voted &pound;. 650. 000 towards the di&s;charge of the navy debt. This &s;um could not be applied &s;olely to the di&s;charge of bills carrying intere&s;t: becau&s;e part of the debt due on &s;eamens wages mu&s;t have been paid, and &s;ome bills carried no intere&s;t at all. Notwith|&s;tanding

this, we find by an account in the Journals of the H. of C. in the following &s;e&s;&s;ion, that the navy debt carying intere&s;t was on the 31&s;t of December 1764 no more than &pound;. 1.687.442. I am &s;ure therefore that I admit too much when I admit the navy debt carrying intere&s;t, after the creation of the navy annuities in the year 1763 to have been &pound;. 2.200.000. Add the exchequer bills, and the whole unfunded debt carrying intere&s;t will be four millions in&s;tead of ten; and the annual intere&s;t paid for it at 4 <HI>per cent.</HI> will be &pound;. 160.000 in&s;tead of &pound;. 299.250. An error of no &s;mall magnitude, and which could not have been owing to inadvertency.</P>
<P>The mi&s;repre&s;entation of the encrea&s;e of the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment is &s;till more extraordinary than that of the intere&s;t on the unfunded debt. The encrea&s;e is great undoubtedly. However, the author finds no fault with it, and urges it only as a matter of argument to &s;upport the &s;trange chi|merical propo&s;als he is to make us in the clo&s;e of his work for the en|crea&s;e of revenue. The greater he made that e&s;tabli&s;hment, the &s;tronger he expected to &s;tand in argument: but, whatever he expected or propo&s;ed, he &s;hould have &s;tated the matter fairly. He tells us that this e&s;tabli&s;hment is near &pound;. 1.500.000 more than it was in 1752, 1753, and other years of peace. This he has done in his u&s;ual manner, by a&s;&s;ertion, without troubling him&s;elf either with proof or probability. For he has not given us any &s;tate of the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment in the years 1753 and 1754, the time which he means to compare with the pre&s;ent. As I am obliged to force him to that preci&s;ion, from which he always flies as from his mo&s;t danger|ous enemy, I have been at the trouble to &s;earch the Journals in the period between the two la&s;t wars: and I find that the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment, con|&s;i&s;ting of the navy, the ordnance, and the &s;everal incidental expences, amounted to &pound;. 2.346.594. Now is this writer wild enough to imagine, that the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment of 1764 and the &s;ub&s;equent years, made up from the &s;ame articles, is &pound;. 3.800.000 and upwards? His a&s;&s;ertion how|ever goes to this. But I mu&s;t take the liberty of correcting him in this gro&s;s mi&s;take, and from an authority he cannot refu&s;e, from his favourite work, and &s;tanding authority, the Con&s;iderations.

the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment of 1764 and 1765 &s;tated at &pound;. 3.609.700. This is near two hundred thou&s;and pounds le&s;s than that given in the State of the Nation. But even from this, in order to render the articles which compo&s;e the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment in the two periods corre&s;pondent (for otherwi&s;e they cannot be compared), we mu&s;t deduct fir&s;t, his articles of the deficiency of land and malt, which amount to &pound;. 300.000. They certainly are no part of the e&s;tabli&s;hment, nor are they included in that &s;um, which I have &s;tated above for the e&s;tabli&s;hment in the time of the former peace. If they were proper to be &s;tated at all, they ought to be &s;tated in both accounts. We mu&s;t al&s;o deduct the deficiencies of funds &pound;. 202.400. The&s;e deficiencies are the difference between the intere&s;t charged on the public for monies borrowed, and the produce of the taxes laid for the di&s;charge of that intere&s;t. Annual provi&s;ion is indeed to be made for them by parliament: but in the enquiry before us, which is only what charge is brought on the public by intere&s;t paid or to be paid for money borrowed, the utmo&s;t that the author &s;hould do is to bring into the account the full intere&s;t for all that money. This he has done in p. 15, and he repeats it in p. 18, the very page I am now examin|ing, &pound;. 2.614.892. To comprehend afterwards in the peace e&s;tabli&s;h|ment the deficiency of the fund created for payment of that intere&s;t, would be laying twice to the account of the war part of the &s;ame &s;um. Suppo&s;e ten millions, borrowed at 4 <HI>per cent.</HI> and the fund for payment of the intere&s;t to produce no more than &pound;. 200.000. The whole annual charge on the public is &pound;. 400.000. It can be no more. But to charge the intere&s;t in one part of the account, and then the deficiency in the other, would be charging &pound;. 600.000. The deficiency of funds mu&s;t therefore be al&s;o deducted from the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment in the Con&s;ide|rations; and then the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment in that author will be reduced to the &s;ame articles with tho&s;e included in the &s;um I have already men|tioned for the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment before the la&s;t war, in the year 1753, and 1754.</P>

<P>It is true, the extraordinaries of the army have been found con&s;iderably greater than the author of the Con&s;iderations was plea&s;ed to foretell they would be. The author of the Pre&s;ent State avails him&s;elf of that encrea&s;e, and, finding it &s;uit his purpo&s;e, &s;ets the whole down in the peace-e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the pre&s;ent times. If this is allowed him, his error perhaps may be reduced to &pound;. 700.000. But I doubt the author of the Con&s;iderations will not thank him for admitting &pound;. 200.000. and upwards, as the peace|e&s;tabli&s;hment for extraordinaries, when that author has &s;o much la|boured to confine them within &pound;. 35.000.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome of the capital fallacies of the author. To break the thread of my di&s;cour&s;e as little as po&s;&s;ible, I have thrown into the margin many in&s;tances, though God knows far from the whole, of his inaccuracies, incon&s;i&s;tencies, and want of common care. I think my&s;elf obliged to take &s;ome notice of them, in order to take off from any authority this writer may have; and to put an end to the deference which carele&s;s men are apt to pay to one who boldly arrays his accounts, and mar&s;hals his figures, in perfect confidence that their correctne&s;s will never be examined <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><P>Upon the money borrowed in 1760, the premium of 1 <HI>per cent.</HI> was for 21 years, not for 20; this annuity has been paid 8 years in&s;tead of 7; the &s;um paid is therefore &pound;. 640&punc;000 in|&s;tead of &pound;. 560.000; the remaining term is worth 10 years and a quarter in&s;tead of 11 years*; its value is &pound;. 820.000 in&s;tead of &pound;. 880.000; and the whole value of that premium is &pound;. 1.460.000 in&s;tead of 1.440.000. The like errors are ob&s;ervable in his computation on the additional capital of 3 <HI>per cent.</HI> on the loan of that year. In like manner, on the loan of 1762, the author computes on 5 years payments in&s;tead of 6; and &s;ays in expre&s;s terms, that take 5 from 19, and there remains 13. The&s;e are not errors of the pen or the pre&s;s; the &s;everal computations pur&s;ued in this part of the work with great diligence and earne&s;tne&s;s prove them errors upon much deliberation. Thus the premiums in 1759 are ca&s;t up &pound;. 90.000 too little, an error in the fir&s;t rule of arithmetic. <Q>The annuities borrowed in 1756 and 1758 are,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>to continue till redeemed by parliament.</Q> He does not take notice that the fir&s;t are irredeemable till February 1771, the other till July 1782. In this the amount of the premiums is computed on the time which they have run. Weakly and ignorantly; for he might have added to this and &s;trengthened his argument, &s;uch as it is, by charging al&s;o the value of the additional 1 <HI>per cent.</HI> from the day on which he wrote to at lea&s;t that day on which the&s;e annuities become redeemable. To make ample amends, however, he has added to the premiums of 15 <HI>per cent.</HI> in 1759, and 3 <HI>per cent.</HI> in 1760, the annuity paid for them &s;ince their commencement; the fallacy of which is manife&s;t: for the premiums in the&s;e ca&s;es can be neither more or le&s;s than the additional capital for which the public &s;tands engaged, and is ju&s;t the &s;ame whether 5 or 500 years annuity has been paid for it. In private life, no man per&s;uades him&s;elf that he has borrowed &pound;. 200, be|cau&s;e he happens to have paid 20 years intere&s;t on loan of &pound;. 100.</P>

However, for argument, I am content to take his &s;tate of it. The debt was and is enormous. The war was expen&s;ive. The be&s;t oeco|nomy had not perhaps been u&s;ed. But I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that war and oeconomy are things not ea&s;ily reconciled; and that the attempt of leaning towards par&s;imony in &s;uch a &s;tate may be the wor&s;t management, and in the end the wor&s;t oeconomy in the world, hazarding the total lo&s;s of all the charge incurred, and of every thing el&s;e along with it.</P>
<P>But <HI>cui bono</HI> all this detail of our debt? Has the author given a &s;ingle light towards any material reduction of it? Not a glimmering. We &s;hall &s;ee in its place what &s;ort of thing he propo&s;es. But before he commen|ces his operations, in order to &s;care the public imagination, he rai&s;es by art magic a thick mi&s;t before our eyes, through which glare the mo&s;t gha&s;tly and horrible phantoms:
<Q><L>Hunc igitur terrorem animi tenebrasque nece&s;&s;e e&s;t,</L>
<L>Non radii &s;olis, neque lucida tela diei</L>
<L>Di&s;cutiant, &s;ed naturae &s;pecies ratioque.</L></Q>
Let us therefore calmly, if we can for the fright into which he has put us, appreciate tho&s;e dreadful and deformed gorgons and hydras, which in|habit the joyle&s;s regions of an imagination, fruitful in nothing but the production of mon&s;ters.</P>
<P>His whole repre&s;entation is founded on the &s;uppo&s;ed operation of our debt, upon our manufactures, and our trade. To this cau&s;e he attri|butes a certain &s;uppo&s;ed dearne&s;s of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, which mu&s;t compel our manufacturers to emigrate to cheaper countries, particularly to France, and with them the manufacture. Thence con&s;umption de|clining, and with it revenue. He will not permit the real balance of our trade to be e&s;timated &s;o high as &pound;. 2.500.000, and the intere&s;t of the debt to foreigners carries off &pound;. 1.500.000 of that balance. That

France is not in the &s;ame condition. Then follow his wailings and lamentings, which he renews over and over, according to his cu&s;tom&mdash;a declining trade, and decrea&s;ing &s;pecie&mdash;on the point of becoming tri|butary to France&mdash;of lo&s;ing Ireland&mdash;of having the colonies torn away from us.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing upon which I &s;hall ob&s;erve is, what he takes for granted as the cleare&s;t of all propo&s;itions, the emigration of our manufacturers to <MILESTONE N="30, 31, 32." UNIT="P."> France. I undertake to &s;ay that this a&s;&s;ertion is totally groundle&s;s, and I challenge the author to bring any &s;ort of proof of it. If living is cheaper in France, that is, to be had for le&s;s &s;pecie, wages are proportionably lower. No manufacturer, let the living be what it will, was ever known to fly for refuge, to low wages. Money is the fir&s;t thing which attracts him. Accordingly our wages attract artificers from all parts of the world. From two &s;hillings to one &s;hilling, is a fall, in all mens imaginations, which no calculation upon a difference in the price of the nece&s;&s;aries of life can compen&s;ate. But it will be hard to prove, that a French arti|ficer is better fed, cloathed, lodged, and warmed, than one in England; for that is the &s;en&s;e, and the only &s;en&s;e, of living cheaper. If, in truth and fact, our artificer fares as well in all the&s;e re&s;pects, as one in the &s;ame &s;tate in France&mdash;how &s;tands the matter in point of opinion and prejudice, the &s;prings by which people in that cla&s;s of life are chiefly actuated? The idea of our common people, concerning French living, is dreadful; altogether as dreadful as our author's can po&s;&s;ibly be of the &s;tate of his own country; a way of thinking that will hardly ever prevail on them to de&s;ert to France <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">In a cour&s;e of years a few manufacturers have been tempted abroad, not by cheap living, but by immen&s;e premiums, to &s;et up as ma&s;ters, and to introduce the manufacture. This mu&s;t happen in every country eminent for the &s;kill of its artificers, and has nothing to do with taxes and the price of provi&s;ion.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But, leaving the author's &s;peculations, the fact is, they have not de&s;ert|ed; and of cour&s;e the manufacture cannot be departed, or departing, with them. I am not indeed able to get at all the details of all our manufac|ture; though, I think, I have taken full as much pains for that purpo&s;e as our author. Some I have by me; and they do not hitherto, thank God, &s;upport the author's complaint, unle&s;s a va&s;t increa&s;e of the quantity of goods manufactured, be a proof of lo&s;ing the manufacture. On a view of the regi&s;ters in the We&s;t-riding of York&s;hire, for three years before the war, and for the three la&s;t, it appears, that the quantities of cloths entered were as follow:

<P>In this manner this capital branch of manufacture has encrea&s;ed, un|der the encrea&s;e of taxes; and this not from a declining, but from a greatly flouri&s;hing period of commerce. I may &s;ay the &s;ame on the be&s;t authority of the fabrick of thin goods at Halifax; of the bays at Roch|dale; and of that infinite variety of admirable manufactures that grow and extend every year among the &s;pirited, inventive, and enterprizing traders of Manche&s;ter.</P>
<P>A trade &s;ometimes &s;eems to peri&s;h when it only a&s;&s;umes a differ|ent form. Thus the coar&s;e&s;t woollens were formerly exported in great quantities to Ru&s;&s;ia. The Ru&s;&s;ians now &s;upply them&s;elves with the&s;e goods. But the export thither of finer cloths has encrea&s;ed in pro|portion, as the other has declined. Po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome parts of the kingdom may have felt &s;omething like a languor in bu&s;ine&s;s. Objects like trade and manufacture, which the very attempt to confine would certainly de|&s;troy, frequently change their place; and thereby, far from being lo&s;t, are often highly improved. Thus &s;ome manufactures have decayed in the we&s;t and &s;outh, which have made new and more vigorous &s;hoots when tran&s;planted into the north. And here it is impo&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s by, though the author has &s;aid nothing upon it, the va&s;t addition to the ma&s;s of Briti&s;h trade, which has been made by the improvement of Scotland. What does he think of the commerce of the city of Gla&s;gow, and of the manufactures of Pai&s;ley and all the adjacent county? Has this any thing like the deadly a&s;pect and <HI>facies Hippocratica</HI> which the fal&s;e diagno&s;tic of our &s;tate phy&s;ician has given to our trade in general? Has he not heard of the iron works of &s;uch magnitude even in their cradle which are &s;et up on
<PB N="28" REF="29">
the Carron, which at the &s;ame time have drawn nothing from Sheffield, Birmingham, or Wolverhampton?</P>
<P>This might perhaps be enough to &s;hew the entire fal&s;ity of the com|plaint concerning the decline of our manufactures. But every &s;tep we advance, this matter clears up more and more; and the fal&s;e terrors of the author are di&s;&s;ipated, and fade away as the light appears. <Q>The trade and manufactures of this country (&s;ays he) going to ruin, and a diminution of our <HI>revenue from con&s;umption</HI> mu&s;t attend the lo&s;s of &s;o many &s;eamen, and artificers.</Q> Nothing more true than the general ob&s;ervation: no|thing more fal&s;e than its application to our circum&s;tances. Let the re|venue on con&s;umption &s;peak for it&s;elf:

</TABLE>
Here is no diminution. Here is, on the contrary, an immen&s;e encrea&s;e. This is owing, I &s;hall be told, to the new duties, which may encrea&s;e the total bulk; but at the &s;ame time may make &s;ome diminution of the pro|duce of the old. Were this the fact, it would be far from &s;upporting the author's complaint. It might have proved that the burthen lay rather too heavy; but it would never prove that the <HI>revenue from con&s;umption</HI> was impaired, which was his bu&s;ine&s;s to do. But what is the real fact? Let us take, as the be&s;t in&s;tance for the purpo&s;e, the produce of the old hereditary and temporary exci&s;e granted in the reign of Charles the Se|cond, who&s;e object is that of mo&s;t of the new impo&s;itions, from two ave|rages, each of 8 years:

I have taken the&s;e averages as including in each, a war and a peace pe|riod; the fir&s;t before the impo&s;ition of the new duties, the other &s;ince tho&s;e impo&s;itions; and &s;uch is the &s;tate of the olde&s;t branch of the reve|nue from con&s;umption. Be&s;ides the acqui&s;ition of &s;o much new, this article, to &s;peak of no other, has rather encrea&s;ed under the pre&s;&s;ure of all tho&s;e additional taxes to which the author is plea&s;ed to attribute its de&s;truction. But as the author has made his grand effort again&s;t tho&s;e moderate, judicious, and nece&s;&s;ary levies, which &s;upport all the dig|nity, the credit, and the power of his country, the reader will excu&s;e a
<PB N="29" REF="30">
little further detail on this &s;ubject; that we may &s;ee how little oppre&s;&s;ive tho&s;e taxes are on the &s;houlders of the publick, with which he labours &s;o earne&s;tly to load its imagination. For this purpo&s;e we take the &s;tate of that &s;pecific article upon which the two capital burthens of the war leaned the mo&s;t immediately, by the additional duties on malt, and upon beer:

</TABLE>
Here is the effect of two &s;uch daring taxes as <HI>3d.</HI> by the bu&s;hel addi|tional on malt, and <HI>3s.</HI> by the barrel additional on beer. Two impo&s;itions laid without remi&s;&s;ion one upon the neck of the other; and laid upon an object which before had been immen&s;ely loaded. They did not in the lea&s;t impair the con&s;umption: it has grown under them. It appears that, upon the whole, the people did not feel &s;o much inconvenience from the new duties as to oblige them to take refuge in the private brewery. Quite the contrary happened in both the&s;e re&s;pects in the reign of king William; and it happened from much &s;lighter impo&s;itions <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Although the public brewery has con&s;iderably encrea&s;ed in this latter period, the produce of the malt tax has been &s;omething le&s;s than in the former; this cannot be attributed to the new malt tax. Had this been the cau&s;e of the le&s;&s;ened con&s;umption, the public brewery, &s;o much more burthened, mu&s;t have felt it more. The cau&s;e of this diminution of the malt tax, I take to have been principally owing to the greater dearne&s;s of corn in the &s;econd period than the fir&s;t, which, in all its con&s;equences, affected the people in the country much more than tho&s;e in the towns. But the revenue from con&s;umption was not on the whole impaired, as we have &s;een in the foregoing page.</NOTE>. No people can long con|&s;ume a commodity for which they are not well able to pay. An enlight|ened reader laughs at the incon&s;i&s;tent chimera of our author, of a people univer&s;ally luxurious, and at the &s;ame time oppre&s;&s;ed with taxes and de|clining in trade. For my part, I cannot look on the&s;e duties as the au|thor does. He &s;ees nothing but the burthen. I can perceive the burthen as well as he; but I cannot avoid contemplating al&s;o the &s;trength that &s;up|ports it. From thence I draw the mo&s;t comfortable a&s;&s;urances of the future vigour, and the ample re&s;ources, of this great mi&s;repre&s;ented coun|try; and can never prevail on my&s;elf to make complaints which have no cau&s;e, in order to rai&s;e hopes which have no foundation.</P>
<P>When a repre&s;entation is built on truth and nature, one member &s;upports the other, and mutual lights are given and received from every part. Thus, as our manufacturers have not de&s;erted, nor the manufacture left us, nor the con&s;umption declined, nor the revenue &s;unk, &s;o neither has trade,

which is at once the re&s;ult, mea&s;ure, and cau&s;e of the whole, in the lea&s;t decayed, as our author has thought proper &s;ometimes to affirm, con&s;tantly to &s;uppo&s;e, as if it were the mo&s;t indi&s;putable of all propo&s;itions. The rea|dear will &s;ee below the comparative &s;tate of our trade in three of the be&s;t years before our encrea&s;e of debt and taxes, and with it the three la&s;t years &s;ince the author's date of our ruin <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><TABLE>

<P>In the la&s;t three years the whole of our exports was between 44 and 45 millions. In the three years preceding the war, it was no more than from 35 to 36 millions. The average balance of the former period was &pound;. 3. 706. 000; of the latter, &s;omething above four millions. It is true, that whil&s;t the impre&s;&s;ions of the author's de&s;tructive war continued, our trade was greater than it is at pre&s;ent. One of the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equen|ces of the peace was, that France mu&s;t gradually recover a part of tho&s;e markets of which &s;he had been originally in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. However, after all the&s;e deductions, &s;till the gro&s;s trade in the wor&s;t year of the pre&s;ent is better than in the be&s;t year of any former period of peace. A very great part of our taxes, is not the greate&s;t, has been impo&s;ed &s;ince the begin|ning of this century. On the author's principles, this continual encrea&s;e of taxes mu&s;t have ruined our trade, or at lea&s;t entirely checked its growth. But I have a manu&s;cript of Davenant, which contains an ab|&s;tract of our trade for the years 1703 and 1704; by which it appears,
<PB N="31" REF="32">
that the whole export from England did not then exceed &pound;. 6. 552. 019. It is now con&s;iderably more than double that amount. Yet England was then a rich and flouri&s;hing nation.</P>
<P>The author endeavours to derogate from the balance in our favour as it &s;tands on the Entries, and reduces it from 4 millions as it there appears to no more than &pound;. 2. 500. 000. His ob&s;ervation on the loo&s;ene&s;s and inaccura|cy of the export entries is ju&s;t; and that the error is always an error of exce&s;s, I readily admit. But becau&s;e, as u&s;ual, he has wholly omitted &s;ome very material facts, his conclu&s;ion is as erroneous as the entries he complains of.</P>
<P>On this point of the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e entries I &s;hall make a few ob&s;erva|tions. 1&s;t, The inaccuracy of the&s;e entries can extend only to FREE GOODS, that is, to &s;uch Briti&s;h products and manufactures, as are exported without drawback and without bounty; which do not in general amount to more than two thirds at the very utmo&s;t of the whole export even of <HI>our home products.</HI> The valuable articles of corn, malt, leather, hops, beer, and many others, do not come under this objection of inaccuracy. The ar|ticle of CERTIFICATE GOODS re-exported, a va&s;t branch of our commerce, admits of no error (except &s;ome &s;maller frauds which cannot be e&s;timated), as they have all a drawback of duty, and the exporter mu&s;t therefore cor|rectly &s;pecify their quantity and kind. The author therefore is not war|ranted from the known error in &s;ome of the entries, to make a general defalcation from the whole balance in our favour. This error cannot affect more than half, if &s;o much, of the export article. 2dly, In the ac|count made up at the in&s;pector general's office, they e&s;timate only the original co&s;t of Briti&s;h products as they are here purcha&s;ed; and on foreign goods, only the prices in the country from whence they are &s;ent. This was the method e&s;tabli&s;hed by Mr. Davenant; and, as far as it goes, it certainly is a good one. But the profits of the merchant at home, and of our factories abroad, are not taken into the account: which profit on &s;uch an immen&s;e quantity of goods exported and re-exported cannot fail of being very great; five <HI>per cent.</HI> upon the whole, I &s;hould think a very mode|rate allowance. 3dly, It does not comprehend the advantage ari&s;ing from the employment of 600. 000 tons of &s;hipping, which mu&s;t be paid by the foreign con&s;umer, and which, in many bulky articles of commerce, is equal to the value of the commodity. This can &s;carcely be rated at le&s;s than a million annually. 4thly, The whole import from Ireland and America, and from the We&s;t Indies, is &s;et again&s;t us in the ordinary way of &s;triking a balance of imports and exports; whereas the import and ex|port are both our own. This is ju&s;t as ridiculous, as to put again&s;t the general balance of the nation, how much more goods Che&s;hire receives from London, than London from Che&s;hire. The whole revolves and circu|lates through this kingdom, and is, &s;o far as it regards our profit, in the nature
<PB N="32" REF="33">
of home trade, as much as if the &s;everal countries of America and Ireland were all pieced to Cornwall. The cour&s;e of exchange with all the&s;e places is fully &s;ufficient to demon&s;trate that this kingdom has the whole advantage of their commerce. When the final profit upon a whole &s;y&s;tem of trade re&s;ts and centers in a certain place, a balance &s;truck in that place merely on the mutual &s;ale of commodities is quite fallacious. 5thly, The cu&s;tom-hou&s;e entries furni&s;h a mo&s;t defective, and indeed ridiculous idea, of the mo&s;t va|luable branch of trade we have in the world, that with Newfoundland. Ob&s;erve what you export thither; a little &s;pirits, provi&s;ion, fi&s;hing lines, and fi&s;hing hooks. Is this <HI>export</HI> the true idea of the Newfoundland trade in the light of a beneficial branch of commerce? nothing le&s;s. Examine our <HI>imports</HI> from thence; it &s;eems, upon this vulgar idea of exports and im|ports, to turn the balance again&s;t you. But your exports to Newfound|land are your own goods. Your import is your own food; as much your own, as that you rai&s;e with your ploughs out of your own &s;oil; and not your lo&s;s, but your gain; your riches, not your poverty. But &s;o fallacious is this way of judging, that neither the export nor import, nor both toge|ther, &s;upply any idea approaching to adequate of that branch of bu&s;ine&s;s. The ve&s;&s;els in that trade go &s;trait from Newfoundland to the foreign mar|ket; and the &s;ale there, not the import here, is the mea&s;ure of its value. That trade which is one of your greate&s;t and be&s;t is hardly &s;o much as &s;een in the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e entries; and it is not of le&s;s annual value to this nation than &pound;. 400. 000. 6thly, The quality of your imports mu&s;t be con&s;ider|ed as well as the quantity. To &s;tate the whole of the foreign import <HI>as lo&s;s,</HI> is exceedingly ab&s;urd. All the iron, hemp, flax, cotton, Spani&s;h wool, raw &s;ilk, woolen and linen yarn, which we import, are by no means to be con&s;idered, as the matter of a merely luxurious con&s;umption; which is the idea too generally and loo&s;ely annexed to our import article. The&s;e above|mentioned are materials of indu&s;try, not of luxury, which are wrought up here, in many in&s;tances, to ten times, and more, of their original value. Even where they are not &s;ub&s;ervient to our exports, they &s;till add to our in|ternal wealth, which con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;tock of u&s;eful commodities, as much as in gold and &s;ilver. In looking over the &s;pecific articles of our export and import, I have often been a&s;toni&s;hed for how &s;mall a part of the &s;upply of our con&s;umption, either luxurious or convenient, we are indebted to na|tions properly foreign to us.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations are entirely pa&s;&s;ed over by the author; they have been but too much neglected by mo&s;t who have &s;peculated on this &s;ubject. But they ought never to be omitted by tho&s;e who mean to come to any thing like the true &s;tate of the Briti&s;h trade. They compen&s;ate, and they more than compen&s;ate, every thing which the author can cut off with any appearance of rea&s;on for the over-entry of Briti&s;h goods; and they re&s;tore
<PB N="33" REF="34">
to us that balance of four millions, which the author has thought proper on &s;uch a very poor and limited comprehen&s;ion of the object to reduce to &pound;. 2. 500. 000.</P>
<P>In general this author is &s;o circum&s;tanced, that to &s;upport his theory he is obliged to a&s;&s;ume his facts; and then, if you allow his facts, they will not &s;upport his conclu&s;ions. What if all he &s;ays of the &s;tate of this ba|lance were true? did not the &s;ame objections always lie to cu&s;tom-hou&s;e entries? do they defalcate more from the entries of 1766 than from tho&s;e of 1754? If they prove us ruined, we were always ruined. Some ravens have always indeed croaked out this kind of &s;ong. They have a malignant delight in pre&s;aging mi&s;chief when they are not employed in doing it: they are mi&s;erable and di&s;apointed at every in&s;tance of the public pro&s;perity. They overlook us like the malevolent being of the poet:</P>
<Q><L>Tritonida con&s;picit arcem</L>
<L>Ingeniis, opibu&s;que, et fe&s;ta pace virentem;</L>
<L>Vixque tenet lacrymas quia nil lacrymabile vidit.</L></Q>
<P>It is in this &s;pirit that &s;ome have looked upon tho&s;e accidents, that ca&s;t an occa&s;ional damp upon trade. Their imaginations entail the&s;e ac|cidents upon us in perpetuity. We have had &s;ome bad harve&s;ts. This mu&s;t very di&s;advantageou&s;ly affect the balance of trade, and the navigation of a people, &s;o large a part of who&s;e commerce is in grain. But, in knowing the cau&s;e, we are morally certain, that, according to the cour&s;e of events, it cannot long &s;ub&s;i&s;t. In the three la&s;t years we have exported &s;carcely any grain; in good years that export hath been worth twelve hundred thou&s;and pounds and more; in the two la&s;t years, far from exporting, we have been obliged to import to the amount perhaps of our former ex|portation. So that in this article the balance mu&s;t be &pound;. 2. 000. 000 again&s;t us; that is, one million in the cea&s;ing of gain, the other in the increa&s;e of expenditure. But none of the author's promi&s;es or projects could have prevented this misfortune; and, thank God, we do not want him or them to relieve us from it; although, if his friends &s;hould now come into power, I doubt not but they will be ready to take credit for any encrea&s;e of trade or exci&s;e, that may ari&s;e from the happy circum|&s;tance of a good harve&s;t.</P>
<P>This connects with his loud laments and melancholy progno&s;tications concerning the high price of the nece&s;&s;aries of life and the products of labour. With all his others I deny this fact; and I again call upon him to prove it. Take average and not accident, the grand and fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary of life is cheap in this country; and that too as weighed, not again&s;t labour, which is its true counterpoi&s;e, but again&s;t money. Does he call the price of
<PB N="34" REF="35">
wheat at this day, between 32 and 40 &s;hillings <HI>per</HI> quarter in London, dear <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">It is dearer in &s;ome places, and rather cheaper in others; but it mu&s;t &s;oon all come to a level.</NOTE>? He mu&s;t know that fuel (an object of the highe&s;t order in the nece&s;|&s;aries of life, and of the fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ity in almo&s;t every kind of manufacture) is in many of our provinces cheaper than in any part of the globe. Meat is on the whole not exce&s;&s;ively dear, whatever its price may be at particular times and from particular accidents. If it has had any thing like an uniform ri&s;e, this enhancement may ea&s;ily be proved not to be owing to the encrea&s;e of taxes, but to uniform encrea&s;e of con&s;umption and of money. Dimini&s;h the latter, and meat in your markets will be &s;ufficiently cheap in account, but much dearer in effect; becau&s;e fewer will be in a condition to buy. Thus your apparent plenty will be real indigence. At pre&s;ent, even under temporary di&s;advantages, the u&s;e of fle&s;h is greater here than any where el&s;e; it is continued without any in|terruption of Lents or meagre days; it is &s;u&s;tained and growing even with the encrea&s;e of our taxes. But &s;ome have the art of converting even the &s;igns of national pro&s;perity into &s;ymptoms of decay and ruin. And our author, who &s;o loudly di&s;claims popularity, never fails to lay hold of the mo&s;t vulgar popular prejudices and humours, in hopes to captivate the crowd. Even tho&s;e peevi&s;h di&s;po&s;itions, which grow out of &s;ome tran&s;itory &s;uffering, tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ing clouds which float in our changeable atmo&s;phere, are by him indu&s;triou&s;ly figured into frightful &s;hapes, in order fir&s;t to terrify and then to govern the populace.</P>
<P>It was not enough for the author's purpo&s;e to give this fal&s;e and di&s;cou|raging picture of the &s;tate of his own country. It did not fully an&s;wer his end, to exaggerate her butthens, to depreciate her &s;ucce&s;&s;es and to vilify her character. Nothing had been done unle&s;s the &s;ituation of France were exalted in proportion as that of England had been aba&s;ed. The reader will excu&s;e the citation I make at length from his book; he out|does him&s;elf upon this occa&s;ion. His confidence is indeed unparalleled, and altogether of the heroic ca&s;t.</P>
<P><Q>If our rival nations were in the &s;ame circum&s;tances with our&s;elves, the <HI>augmentation of our Taxes would produce no ill con&s;equences:</HI> if we were obliged to rai&s;e our prices, they mu&s;t, from the &s;ame cau&s;es, do the like, and could take no advantage by under-&s;elling and under|working us. But the alarming con&s;ideration to Great Britain is, <HI>that France is not in the &s;ame condition.</HI> Her di&s;tre&s;&s;es, during the war, were great, but they were immediate; her want of credit, as has been &s;aid, compelled her to impoveri&s;h her people by rai&s;ing the greate&s;t part of her &s;upplies within the year; <HI>but the burdens &s;he impo&s;ed on them were, in a great mea&s;ure, temporary, and mu&s;t be greatly dimini&s;hed by a</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="36">
<HI>few years of peace.</HI> She could procure no con&s;iderable loans, there|fore &s;he has mortgaged no <HI>&s;uch oppre&s;&s;ive taxes as tho&s;e of Great Britain has impo&s;ed in perpetuity for payment of intere&s;t.</HI> Peace mu&s;t, therefore, &s;oon re-e&s;tabli&s;h her commerce and manufactures, e&s;pecially as the comparative <HI>lightne&s;s of taxes,</HI> and the cheapne&s;s of living, in that country, mu&s;t make France an a&s;ylum for Briti&s;h manufactures and artificers.</Q> On this the author re&s;ts the merits of his whole &s;y&s;tem. And on this point I will join i&s;&s;ue with him. If France is not at lea&s;t in the <HI>&s;ame condition,</HI> even in that very condition which the author fal&s;ely repre&s;ents to be ours, if the very rever&s;e of his propo&s;ition be not true, then I will admit his State of the Nation to be ju&s;t; and all his inferences from that &s;tate to be logical and conclu&s;ive. It is not &s;urprizing, that the author &s;hould hazard our opinion of his veracity. That is a virtue on which great &s;tate&s;men do not perhaps pique them&s;elves &s;o much: but it is &s;omewhat extraordinary, that he &s;hould &s;take on a very poor calcu|lation of chances, all credit for care, for accuracy, and for knowledge of the &s;ubject of which he treats. He is ra&s;h and inaccurate, becau&s;e he thinks he writes to a public ignorant and inattentive. But he may find him&s;elf in that re&s;pect, as in many others, greatly mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>In order to contra&s;t the light and vigorous condition of France with that of England, weak, and &s;inking under her burthens, he &s;tates in his 10th page, that France had rai&s;ed &pound;. 50. 314. 378 &s;terling <HI>by taxes within the &s;everal years</HI> from the year 1756 to 1762 both inclu&s;ive. An Engli&s;hman mu&s;t &s;tand agha&s;t at &s;uch a repre&s;entation: To find France able to <HI>rai&s;e within the year</HI> &s;ums little inferior to all that we were able even to <HI>borrow</HI> on intere&s;t with all the re&s;ources of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed credit in the world! Europe was filled with a&s;toni&s;hment when they &s;aw Eng|land <HI>borrow</HI> in one year twelve millions. It was thought, and very ju&s;tly, no &s;mall proof of national &s;trength and financial &s;kill to find a &s;und for the payment of the intere&s;t upon this &s;um. The intere&s;t of this, com|puted with the one <HI>per cent.</HI> annuities, amounted only to &pound;. 600.000 a year. This, I &s;ay, was thought a &s;urprizing effort even of credit. But this author talks, as of a thing not worth proving, and but ju&s;t worth ob|&s;erving, that France in one year rai&s;ed &s;ixteen times that &s;um without borrowing, and continued to rai&s;e &s;ums not far from equal to it for &s;eve|ral years together? Suppo&s;e &s;ome Jacob Henriques had propo&s;ed, in the year 1762, to prevent a perpetual charge on the nation by rai&s;ing ten millions within the year. He would be con&s;idered not as a har&s;h financier who laid an heavy hand on the public; but as a poor vi&s;ionary, who had run mad on &s;upplies and taxes. They who know that the whole land tax of England at <HI>4s.</HI> in the pound, rai&s;es but two millions; will not ea&s;ily apprehend that any &s;uch &s;ums as the author has conjured
<PB N="36" REF="37">
up can be rai&s;ed even in the mo&s;t opulent nations. France owed a large debt, and was incumbered with heavy e&s;tabli&s;hments, before that war. The author does not formally deny that &s;he borrowed &s;omething in every year of its continuance; let him produce the funds for this a&s;toni&s;hing annual addition to all her va&s;t preceding taxes, an addition equal to the whole exci&s;e, cu&s;toms, land and malt taxes of England taken together.</P>
<P>But what mu&s;t be the reader's a&s;toni&s;hment, perhaps his indignation, if he &s;hould find that this great financier has fallen into the mo&s;t unac|countable of all errors, no le&s;s an error than that of mi&s;taking the <HI>identi|cal &s;ums borrowed by France upon intere&s;t, for &s;upplies rai&s;ed within the year.</HI> Can it be conceived that any man only entered into the fir&s;t rudiments of finance &s;hould make &s;o egregious a blunder; &s;hould write it, &s;hould print it; &s;hould carry it to a &s;econd edition; &s;hould take it not collaterally and incidentally, but lay it down as the corner &s;tone of his whole &s;y&s;tem in &s;uch an important point as the comparative &s;tates of France and Eng|land? But it will be &s;aid, that it was his misfortune to be ill inform|ed. Not at all. A man of any loo&s;e general knowledge, and of the mo&s;t ordinary &s;agacity, never could have been mi&s;informed in &s;o gro&s;s a manner; becau&s;e he would have immediately rejected &s;o wild and extra|vagant an account.</P>
<P>The fact is this: the credit of France, bad as it might have been, did enable her (not to rai&s;e within the year) but to <HI>borrow</HI> the very &s;ums the author mentions; that is to &s;ay 1.106.916.261 livres, making in the author's computation &pound;. 50.314.378. The credit of France was low; but it was not annihilated. She did not derive, as our author choo&s;es to a&s;&s;ert, any advantages from the debility of her credit. Its con&s;equence was the natural one: &s;he borrowed; but &s;he borrowed upon bad terms, indeed on the mo&s;t exorbitant u&s;ury.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking of a foreign revenue, the very pretence to accuracy would be the mo&s;t inaccurate thing in the world. Neither the author nor I can with certainty authenticate the information we communicate to the public, nor in an affair of eternal fluctuation arrive at perfect exactne&s;s. All we can do, and this we may be expected to do, is to avoid gro&s;s errors and blunders of a capital nature. We cannot order the proper officer to lay the accounts before the hou&s;e. But the reader mu&s;t judge on the pro|bability of the accounts we lay before him. The author &s;peaks of France as rai&s;ing her &s;upplies for war by taxes within the year; and of her debt, as a thing &s;carcely worthy of notice. I affirm that &s;he borrowed large &s;ums in every year; and has thereby accumulated an immen&s;e debt. This debt continued after the war infinitely to embarra&s;s her affairs; and to find &s;ome means for its reduction was then and has ever &s;ince been the fir&s;t object of her policy. But &s;he has &s;o little &s;ucceeded in all her efforts,
<PB N="37" REF="38">
that the <HI>perpetual</HI> debt of France is at this hour little &s;hort of &pound;. 100.000.000 &s;terling; that &s;he &s;tands charged with at lea&s;t 40.000.000 of Engli&s;h pounds of life-rents and tontines. The annuities paid at this day at the Hotel de Ville of Paris, which are by no means her &s;ole payments of that nature, amount to 139.000.000 of livres, that is, to 6.318.000 pounds; be&s;ides <HI>Billets an porteur,</HI> and various detached and unfunded debts, to a great amount, and which bear an intere&s;t.</P>
<P>At the end of the war, the intere&s;t payable on her debt amounted to upwards of &s;even millions &s;terling. M. De la Verdy, the la&s;t hope of the French finances, was called in, to aid in the reduction of an intere&s;t, &s;o light to our author, &s;o intolerably heavy upon tho&s;e-who are to pay it. After many un&s;ucce&s;sful efforts towards reconciling arbitrary reduction with public credit, he was obliged to go the plain high road of power, and to impo&s;e a tax of 10 <HI>per cent.</HI> upon a very great part of the capital debt of that kingdom; and this mea&s;ure of pre&s;ent ea&s;e, to the de&s;truc|tion of future credit, produced about &pound;. 500.000 a year, which was carried to their <HI>Cai&s;&s;e d'amorti&s;&s;ement,</HI> or &s;inking fund. But &s;o un|faithfully and un&s;teadily has this and all the other articles which compo&s;e that fund been applied to their purpo&s;es, that they have given the &s;tate but very little even of pre&s;ent relief, &s;ince it is known to the whole world that &s;he is behind hand on every one of her e&s;tabli&s;hments. Since the year 1763, there has been no operation of any con&s;equence on the French finances: and in this enviable condition is France at pre&s;ent with regard to her debt.</P>
<P>Every body knows that the principle of the debt is but a name; the intere&s;t is the only thing which can di&s;tre&s;s a nation. Take this idea, which will not be di&s;puted, and compare the intere&s;t paid by England with that paid by France:

The author cannot complain, that I &s;tate the intere&s;t paid by England as too low. He takes it him&s;elf as the extreme&s;t term. Nobody who knows any thing of the French finances will affirm that I &s;tate the in|tere&s;t paid by that kingdom too high. It might be ea&s;ily proved to amount to a great deal more: even this is near two millions above what is paid by England.</P>

There are three &s;tandards to judge of the good condition of a nation with regard to its finances. 1&s;t, The relief of the people. 2d, The equa|lity of &s;upplies to e&s;tabli&s;hments. 3d, The &s;tate of public credit. Try France on all the&s;e &s;tandards.</P>
<P>Although our author very liberally admini&s;ters relief to the people of France, its government has not been altogether &s;o gracious. Since the peace, &s;he has taken off but a &s;ingle <HI>Vingtieme,</HI> or &s;hilling in the pound, and &s;ome &s;mall matter in the capitation. But if the government has relieved them in one point, it has only burthened them the more heavily in another. The <HI>Taille</HI> <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">A tax rated by the intendant in each generality on the pre&s;umed fortune of every per&s;on below the degree of a gentleman.</NOTE>, that grievous and de&s;tructive impo&s;ition, which all their financiers lament, without being able to remove or to replace, has been augmented no le&s;s than 6 millions of livres, or 270.000 pounds Engli&s;h. A further augmentation of this or other duties is now talked of; and it is certainly nece&s;&s;ary to their affairs: &s;o exceedingly remote from either truth or veri&s;imilitude is the author's amazing a&s;&s;ertion, <HI>that the burthens of France in the war were in a great mea&s;ure temporary, and mu&s;t be greatly dimini&s;hed by a few years of peace.</HI></P>
<P>In the next place, if the people of France are not lightened of taxes, &s;o neither is the &s;tate di&s;burthened of charges. I &s;peak from very good information, that the annual income of that &s;tate is at this day 30 mil|lions of livres, or &pound;. 1.350.000 &s;terling, &s;hort of a provi&s;ion for their or|dinary peace e&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;o far are they from the attempt or even hope to di&s;charge any part of the capital of their enormous debt. Indeed un|der &s;uch extreme &s;traitne&s;s and di&s;traction labours the whole body of their finances, &s;o far does their charge outrun their &s;upply in every particular, that no man, I believe, who has con&s;idered their affairs with any degree of attention or information, but mu&s;t hourly look for &s;ome extraordinary convul&s;ion in that whole &s;y&s;tem; the effect of which on France and even on all Europe it is difficult to conjecture.</P>
<P>In the third point of view, their credit. Let the reader ca&s;t his eye on a table of the price of French funds, as they &s;tood a few weeks ago, com|pared with the &s;tate of &s;ome of our Engli&s;h &s;tocks, even in their pre&s;ent low condition:

<P>This &s;tate of the funds of France and England is &s;ufficient to convince even prejudice and ob&s;tinacy, that if France and England are not in the &s;ame condition (as the author affirms they are not) the difference is
<PB N="39" REF="40">
infinitely to the di&s;advantage of France. This depreciation of their funds has not much the air of a nation lightening burthens and di&s;charging debts.</P>
<P>Such is the true comparative &s;tate of the two kingdoms in tho&s;e capi|tal points of view. Now as to the nature of the taxes which provide for this debt, as well as for their ordinary e&s;tabli&s;hments, the author has thought proper to affirm that <Q>they are comparatively light;</Q> <Q>that &s;he has mortgaged no &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ive taxes as ours:</Q> his effrontery on this head is intolerable. Does the author recollect a &s;ingle tax in England to which &s;omething parallel in nature, and as heavy in burthen, does not exi&s;t in France? does he not know that the lands of the noble&s;&s;e are &s;till under the load of the greater part of the old feudal charges, from which the gentry of England have been relieved for upwards of 100 years, and which were in kind, as well as burthen, much wor&s;e than our mo|dern land tax? Be&s;ides that all the gentry of France &s;erve in the army on very &s;lender pay, and to the utter ruin of their fortunes: All tho&s;e who are not noble have their lands heavily taxed. Does he not know that wine, brandy, &s;oap, candles, leather, &s;alt-petre, gunpowder, are taxed in France? has he not heard that government in France has made a monopoly of that great article of <HI>&s;alt?</HI> that they compel the peo|ple to take a certain quantity of it, and at a certain rate, both rate and quantity fixed at the arbitrary plea&s;ure of the impo&s;er <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Before the war it was &s;old to, or rather forced on, the con&s;umer at 11 &s;ous, or about <HI>5d.</HI> the pound. What it is at pre&s;ent, I am not informed. Even this will appear no trivial impo&s;i|tion. In London, &s;alt may be had at a penny &s;aithing per pound from the la&s;t retailer.</NOTE>? That they pay in France the <HI>Taille,</HI> an arbitrary impo&s;ition on pre&s;umed property? That a tax is laid in fact and name, on the &s;ame arbitrary &s;tandard, upon the acqui&s;itions of their <HI>indu&s;try?</HI> and that in France a heavy <HI>capitation-tax</HI> is al&s;o paid, from the highe&s;t to the very poore&s;t &s;ort of people? have we taxes of &s;uch weight, or any thing at all of the compul&s;ion, in the ar|ticle of <HI>&s;alt?</HI> do we pay any <HI>taillage,</HI> any <HI>faculty-tax,</HI> any <HI>indu&s;try-tax?</HI> do we pay any <HI>capitation-tax</HI> what&s;oever. I believe the people of Lon|don would fall into an agony to hear of &s;uch taxes propo&s;ed upon them as are paid in Paris. There is not a &s;ingle article of provi&s;ion for man or bea&s;t, which enters that great city, and is not exci&s;ed; corn, hay, meal, butchers meat, fi&s;h, &s;owls, every thing. I do not here mean to cen&s;ure the policy of taxes laid on the con&s;umption of great luxu|rious cities. I only &s;tate the fact. We &s;hould be with difficulty brought to hear of a tax of 50 <HI>s.</HI> upon every ox &s;old in Smithfield. Yet this tax is paid in Paris. Wine, the lower &s;ort of wine, little better than Engli&s;h &s;mall beer, pays <HI>2d.</HI> a bottle. We indeed tax our beer: but the impo&s;ition on &s;mall beer is very far from heavy. In no part of
<PB N="40" REF="41">
England are eatables of any kind the object of taxation. In almo&s;t every other country in Europe they are exci&s;ed; more or le&s;s, in one place or in another. I have by me the &s;tate of the revenues of many of the princi|pal nations on the continent; and on comparing them with ours, I think I am fairly warranted to a&s;&s;ert, that England is the mo&s;t lightly taxed of any of the great &s;tates of Europe. They who&s;e unnatural and &s;ullen joy ari&s;es from a contemplation of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of their country will revolt at this po&s;ition. But, if I am called upon, I will prove it beyond all po&s;&s;ibi|lity of di&s;pute; even though this proof &s;hould deprive the&s;e gentlemen of the &s;ingular &s;atisfaction of con&s;idering their country as undone; and though the be&s;t civil government, the be&s;t con&s;tituted, and the be&s;t ma|naged revenue that ever the world beheld, &s;hould be thoroughly vindi|cated from their perpetual clamours and complaints. As to our neigh|bour and rival France in addition to what I have here &s;ugge&s;ted, I &s;ay, and when the author choo&s;es formally to deny, I &s;hall formally prove it, that her &s;ubjects pay more than England, on a computation of the wealth of both countries; that her taxes are more injudiciou&s;ly and more op|pre&s;&s;ively impo&s;ed; more vexatiou&s;ly collected; come in a &s;maller pro|portion to the royal coffers, and are le&s;s applied by far to the public &s;er|vice. I am not one of tho&s;e who choo&s;e to take the author's word for this happy and flouri&s;hing condition of the French finances, rather than at|tend to the changes, the violent pu&s;hes, and the de&s;pair, of all her own financiers. Does he choo&s;e to be referred for the ea&s;y and happy condi|tion of the &s;ubject in France to the remon&s;trances of their own parlia|ments, written with &s;uch an eloquence, feeling, and energy, as I have not &s;een exceeded in any other writings? The author may &s;ay their complaints are exaggerated, and the effects of faction. I an&s;wer, that they are the repre&s;entations of numerous, grave, and mo&s;t re&s;pectable bodies of men, upon the affairs of their own country. But, allowing that di&s;content and faction may pervert the judgment of &s;uch venerable bodies in France, we have as good a right to &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;ame cau&s;es may full as probably have produced from a private, however re&s;pectable per&s;on, that frightful, and, I tru&s;t I have &s;hewn, groundle&s;s repre&s;entation of our own affairs in England.</P>
<P>The author is &s;o con&s;cious of the dangerous effects of that repre&s;enta|tion, that he thinks it nece&s;&s;ary, and very nece&s;&s;ary it is, to guard again&s;t them. He a&s;&s;ures us <Q>that he has not made that di&s;play of the difficul|ties of his country, to expo&s;e her coun&s;els to the ridicule of other &s;tates, or to provoke a vanqui&s;hed enemy to in&s;ult her; nor to excite the peo|ples rage again&s;t their governors, or &s;ink them into a de&s;pondency of the public welfare.</Q> I readily admit this apology for his intentions. God forbid I &s;hould think any man capable of entertaining &s;o execrable and
<PB N="41" REF="42">
&s;en&s;ele&s;s a de&s;ign. The true cau&s;e of his drawing &s;o &s;hocking a picture is no more than this; and it ought rather to claim our pity than excite our indignation. He finds him&s;elf out of power; and this condition is into|lerable to him. The &s;ame &s;un which gilds all nature, and exhilarates the whole creation, does not &s;hine upon di&s;appointed ambition. It is &s;ome|thing that rays out of darkne&s;s, and in&s;pires nothing but gloom and me|lancholy. Men in this deplorable &s;tate of mind find a comfort in &s;pread|ing the contagion of their &s;pleen. They find an advantage too; for it is a general popular error to imagine the loude&s;t complainers for the public, to be the mo&s;t anxious for its welfare. If &s;uch per&s;ons can an&s;wer the ends of relief and profit to them&s;elves, they are apt to be carele&s;s enough about either the means or the con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Whatever this complainant's motives may be, the effects can by no po&s;&s;ibility be other than tho&s;e which he &s;o &s;trongly, and, I hope truely, di&s;claims all intention of producing. To verify this, the reader has only to con&s;ider how dreadful a picture he has drawn in his 32d page of the &s;tate of this kingdom; &s;uch a picture as, I believe, has hardly been appli|cable without &s;ome exaggeration to the mo&s;t degenerate and undone commonwealth that ever exi&s;ted. Let this view of things be compared with the pro&s;pect of a remedy which he propo&s;es in the page directly op|po&s;ite and the &s;ub&s;equent. I believe no man living could have imagined it po&s;&s;ible, except for the &s;ake of burle&s;quing a &s;ubject, to propo&s;e re|medies &s;o ridiculou&s;ly di&s;proportionate to the evil, &s;o full of uncertainty in their operation, and depending for their &s;ucce&s;s in every &s;tep upon the happy event of &s;o many new, dangerous, and vi&s;ionary projects. It is not ami&s;s, that he has thought proper to give the publick &s;ome little notice of what they may expect from his friends when our affairs &s;hall be com|mitted to their management. Let us &s;ee how the accounts of di&s;ea&s;e and remedy are balanced in his State of the Nation. In the fir&s;t place, on the &s;ide of evils, he &s;tates, <Q>An empoveri&s;hed and heavily-burthened public. A declining trade and decrea&s;ing &s;pecie. The power of the crown never &s;o much extended over the great; but the great without influence over the lower &s;ort. Parliament lo&s;ing its reverence with the people. The voice of the multitude &s;et up again&s;t the &s;en&s;e of the le|gi&s;lature; a people luxurious and licentious, impatient of rule, and de&s;pi&s;ing all authority. Government relaxed in every &s;inew, and a corrupt &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit pervading the whole. An opinion of many, that the form of government is not worth contending for. No attachment in the bulk of the people towards the con&s;titution. No reverence for the cu&s;toms of our ance&s;tors. No attachment but to private intere&s;t, nor any zeal but for &s;elfi&s;h gratifications. Trade and manufactures going to ruin. Great Britain in danger of becoming tributary to France,
<PB N="42" REF="43">
and the de&s;cent of the crown dependent on her plea&s;ure. Ireland in ca&s;e of war to become a prey to France; and Great Britain, unable to recover Ireland, cede it by treaty (the author never can think of a treaty without making ce&s;&s;ions), in order to purcha&s;e peace for her&s;elf. The colonies left expo&s;ed to the ravages of a dome&s;tic, or the conque&s;t of a foreign enemy.</Q>&mdash;Gloomy enough, God knows. The author well ob&s;erves, <HI>that a mind not totally devoid of feeling cannot look upon &s;uch a pro&s;pect without horror; and an heart capable of humanity mu&s;t be</HI> <MILESTONE N="31" UNIT="P."> <HI>unable to bear its de&s;cription.</HI> He ought to have added, that no man of common di&s;cretion ought to have exhibited it to the public, if it were true; or of common hone&s;ty, if it were fal&s;e.</P>
<P>But now for the comfort; the day-&s;tar which is to ari&s;e in our hearts; the author's grand &s;cheme for totally rever&s;ing this di&s;mal &s;tate of things, and making us <Q>happy at home and re&s;pected abroad, formidable in war and flouri&s;hing in peace. <MILESTONE N="33" UNIT="P."></Q></P>
<P>In this great work he proceeds with a facility equally a&s;toni&s;hing and plea&s;ing. Never was financier le&s;s embara&s;&s;ed by the burthen of e&s;ta|bli&s;hments, or with the difficulty of finding ways and means. If an e&s;ta|bli&s;hment is trouble&s;ome to him, he lops off at a &s;troke ju&s;t as much of it as he choo&s;es. He mows down, without giving quarter, or a&s;&s;igning rea|&s;on, army, navy, ordnance, ordinary, extraordinaries; nothing can &s;tand before him. Then, when he comes to provide, <HI>Amalthea's</HI> horn is in his hands; and he pours out with an inexhau&s;tible bounty, taxes, duties, loans, and revenues, without unea&s;ine&s;s to him&s;elf, or burthen to the publick. In&s;omuch, that when we con&s;ider the abundance of his re&s;our|ces, we cannot avoid being &s;urprized at his extraordinary attention to &s;a|vings. But it is all the exuberance of his goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>This book has &s;o much of a certain tone of power, that one would be almo&s;t tempted to think it written by &s;ome per&s;on who had been in high office. A man is generally rendered &s;omewhat a wor&s;e rea&s;oner for ha|ving been a mini&s;ter. In private, the a&s;&s;ent of li&s;tening and ob&s;equious friends; in publick, the venal cry and prepared vote of a pa&s;&s;ive &s;enate, confirm him in habits of begging the que&s;tion with impunity, and a&s;|&s;erting without thinking him&s;elf obliged to prove. Had it not been for &s;ome &s;uch habits, the author could never have expected that we &s;hould take his e&s;timate for a peace e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;olely on his word.</P>
<P>This e&s;timate which he gives, is the great ground-work of his plan for the national redemption; and it ought to be well and firmly laid, <MILESTONE N="33" UNIT="P."> or what mu&s;t become of the &s;uper&s;tructure? One would have thought the natural method in a plan of reformation would be, to take the pre|&s;ent exi&s;ting e&s;timates as they &s;tand; and then to &s;hew what may be prac|ticably and &s;afely defalcated from them. This would, I &s;ay, be the
<PB N="43" REF="44">
natural cour&s;e; and what would be expected from a man of bu&s;ine&s;s. But this author takes a very different method. For the ground of his &s;pe|culation of a pre&s;ent peace e&s;tabli&s;hment, he re&s;orts to a former &s;pecu|lation of the &s;ame kind, which was in the mind of the mini&s;ter of the year 1764. Indeed it never exi&s;ted any where el&s;e. "The plan," &s;ays <MILESTONE N="33" UNIT="P."> he, with his u&s;ual ea&s;e, <Q>has been already formed, and the outline drawn by the admini&s;tration of 1764. I &s;hall attempt to fill up the void and obliterated parts and trace its operation. The &s;tanding ex|pence of the pre&s;ent (his projected) peace e&s;tabli&s;hment <HI>improved by the experience of the two la&s;t years may be thus e&s;timated;</HI></Q> and he e&s;ti|mates it at &pound;. 3. 468. 161.</P>
<P>Here too it would be natural to expect &s;ome rea&s;ons for condemning the &s;ub&s;equent actual e&s;tabli&s;hments which have &s;o much tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the limits of his plan of 1764, as well as &s;ome arguments in favour of his new project; which has in &s;ome articles exceeded, in others fallen &s;hort, but on the whole is much below his old one. Hardly a word on any of the&s;e points, the only points however that are in the lea&s;t e&s;&s;ential; for unle&s;s you a&s;&s;ign rea&s;ons for the encrea&s;e or diminution of the &s;everal ar|ticles of public charge, the playing at e&s;tabli&s;hments and e&s;timates is an amu&s;ement of no higher order, and of much le&s;s ingenuity, than <HI>Que&s;|tions and commands,</HI> or <HI>What is my thought like?</HI> To bring more di&s;tinctly under the reader's view this author's &s;trange method of proceeding, I will lay before him the three &s;chemes; <HI>viz.</HI> the idea of the mini&s;ters in 1764, the actual e&s;timates of the two la&s;t years as given by the author him&s;elf, and la&s;tly the new project of his political millennium:

<P>It is not from any thing our author has any where &s;aid, that you are enabled to find the ground, much le&s;s the ju&s;tification, of the immen&s;e difference between the&s;e &s;everal &s;y&s;tems; you mu&s;t compare them your|&s;elf, article by article; no very plea&s;ing employment, by the way, to compare the agreement or di&s;agreement of two chimeras. I now only &s;peak of the compari&s;on of his own two projects. As to the latter of them, it differs from the former, by having &s;ome of the articles dimini&s;h|ed, and others encrea&s;ed. I find the chief article of <HI>reduction</HI> ari&s;es from <NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;id. p. 43. St. of N. p. 33.</NOTE> the &s;maller <HI>deficiency</HI> of <HI>land and malt,</HI> and of the <HI>annuity funds,</HI> which
<PB N="44" REF="45">
he brings down to &pound;. 295. 000 in his new e&s;timate, from &pound;. 502. 400, which he had allowed for tho&s;e articles in the Con&s;iderations. With this <HI>reduction,</HI> owing, as it mu&s;t be, merely to a &s;maller deficiency of funds, he has nothing at all to do. It can be no work and no merit of his. But with regard to the <HI>encrea&s;e,</HI> the matter is very different. It is all his own; the publick is loaded (for any thing we can &s;ee to the contrary) entirely <HI>gratis.</HI> The chief articles of the <HI>encrea&s;e</HI> are on the <HI>navy,</HI> and on the <HI>army</HI> and <HI>ord|nance extraordinaries;</HI> the <HI>navy</HI> being e&s;timated in his <HI>State of the Nation</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;id. p. 43. S. of N. l. 33.</NOTE> &pound;. 50. 000 a year more, and the <HI>army</HI> and <HI>ordnance extraordinaries</HI> &pound;. 40. 000 more than he had thought proper to allow for them in that e&s;timate in his <HI>Con&s;iderations,</HI> which he makes the foundation of his pre&s;ent project. He has given no &s;ort of rea&s;on, &s;tated no &s;ort of nece&s;&s;ity for this additional allowance either in the one article or the other. What is &s;till &s;tronger, he admits that his allowance for the army and ordnance extras is too great, and expre&s;sly refers you to the <HI>Con&s;iderations;</HI> where, far from <MILESTONE N="34" UNIT="P."> giving &pound;. 75. 000 a year to that &s;ervice, as the <HI>State of the Nation</HI> has done, the author apprehends his own &s;canty provi&s;ion of &pound;. 35. 000 to be by far too con&s;iderable, and thinks it may well admit of further reductions <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">The author of the State of the Nation, p. 34, informs us, that the &s;um of &pound;. 75. 000, allowed by him for the extras of the army and ordnance, is far le&s;s than was allowed for the &s;ame &s;ervice in the years 1767 and 1768. It is &s;o undoubtedly, and by at lea&s;t &pound;. 200. 000. He &s;ees that he cannot abide by the plan of the Con&s;iderations in this point, nor is he willing wholly to give it up. Such an enormous difference as that between &pound;. 35. 000 and &pound;. 300. 000 puts him to a &s;tand. Should he adopt the latter plan of encrea&s;ed expence, he mu&s;t then confe&s;s, that he had, on a former occa&s;ion, egregiou&s;ly trifled with the publick; at the &s;ame time all his future promi&s;es of reduction mu&s;t fall to the ground. If he &s;tuck to the &pound;. 35. 000, he was &s;ure that every one mu&s;t expect from him &s;ome account how this mon&s;trous charge came to continue ever &s;ince the war, when it was clearly unnece&s;&s;ary; how all tho&s;e &s;ucce&s;|&s;ions of mini&s;ters (his own included), came to pay it; and why his great friend in parliament, and his partizans without doors, came not to pur&s;ue to ruin, at lea&s;t to utter &s;hame, the au|thors of &s;o groundle&s;s and &s;candalous a profu&s;ion. In this &s;trait he took a middle way; and to come nearer the real &s;tate of the &s;ervice, he outbid the Con&s;iderations, at one &s;troke, &pound;. 40. 000; at the &s;ame time he hints to you, that you may <HI>expect</HI> &s;ome benefit al&s;o from the original plan. But the author of the Con&s;iderations will not &s;uffer him to e&s;cape &s;o. He has pinned him down to his &pound;. 35. 000; for that is the &s;um he has cho&s;en, not as what he thinks will probably be required, but as making the mo&s;t ample allowance for every po&s;&s;ible contingency. See that author, p. 42 and 43.</NOTE>. Thus, according to his own principles, this great oeconomi&s;t falls into a vicious prodigality; and is as far in his e&s;timates from a con&s;i&s;tency with his own principles as with the real nature of the &s;ervices.</P>
<P>Still, however, his pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment differs from its archetype of 1764, by being, though rai&s;ed in particular parts, upon the whole about &pound;. 141. 000 &s;maller. It is improved, he tells us, by the experience of the two la&s;t years. One would have concluded that the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment of the&s;e two years had been le&s;s than that of 1764, in order to &s;ugge&s;t to
<PB N="45" REF="46">
the author his improvements, which enabled him to reduce it. But how does that turn out?</P>

The experience then of the two la&s;t years ought naturally to have given the idea of an heavier e&s;tabli&s;h|ment; but this writer is able to dimini&s;h by encrea&s;ing, and to draw the effects of &s;ubtraction from the operations of addition. By means of the&s;e new powers he may certainly do whatever he plea&s;es. He is indeed mo|derate enough in the u&s;e of them, and conde&s;cends to &s;ettle his e&s;tabli&s;h|ment at &pound;. 3. 468. 161 a year.</P>
<P>However, he has not yet done with it; he has further ideas of &s;aving, and new re&s;ources of revenue. The&s;e additional &s;avings are principally two: 1&s;t, <HI>It is to be hoped,</HI> &s;ays he, that the &s;um of &pound;. 250. 000 (which in the e&s;timate he allows for the deficiency of land and malt) will be le&s;s <MILESTONE N="34" UNIT="P."> by &pound;. 37. 924. <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><P>In making up this account he falls into a &s;urpri&s;ing error of arithmetic. <Q>The deficien|cy <MILESTONE N="33" UNIT="P."> of the land-tax in the year 1754 and 1755, when it was at <HI>2s.</HI> amounted to no more, on a medium, than &pound;. 49. 372; to which, if we add <HI>half the &s;um,</HI> it will give us &pound;. 79. 058 as the peace deficiency at <HI>3s.</HI></Q></P>

<P>2d, That the &s;um of &pound;. 20. 000 allowed for the Foundling Ho&s;pital, and &pound;. 1. 800 for American Surveys, will &s;oon cea&s;e to be nece&s;&s;ary, as the &s;ervices will be compleated.</P>
<P>What follows with regard to the re&s;ources is very well worthy of the <MILESTONE N="Ibid."> reader's attention. <Q>Of this e&s;timate, &s;ays he, upwards of &pound;. 300. 000 will be for the plantation &s;ervice; and that &s;um, <HI>I hope,</HI> the people of Ireland and the colonies <HI>might be induced</HI> to take off Great Britain, and defray between them in the proportion of &pound;. 200. 000 by the colonies, and &pound;. 100. 000 by Ireland.</Q></P>
<P>Such is the whole of this mighty &s;cheme. Take his reduced e&s;timate, and his further reductions, and his re&s;ources all together, and the re&s;ult
<PB N="46" REF="47">
will be; He will <HI>certainly</HI> lower the provi&s;ion made for the navy. He will cut off largely (God knows what or how) from the army and ord|nance extraordinaries. He may be <HI>expected</HI> to cut off more. He <HI>hopes</HI> that the deficiencies on land and malt will be le&s;s than u&s;ual; and he <HI>hopes</HI> that America and Ireland might be <HI>induced</HI> to take off &pound;. 300.000 of our annual charges.</P>
<P>If any one of the&s;e Hopes, Mights, In&s;inuations, Expectations, and In|ducements &s;hould fail him, there will be a formidable gaping breach in his whole project. If all of them &s;hould fail, he has left the nation without a glimmering of hope in this thick night of terrors which he has thought fit to &s;pread about us. If every one of them, which attended with &s;ucce&s;s, would &s;ignify any thing to our revenue, can have no effect but to add to our di&s;tractions and dangers, we &s;hall be if po&s;&s;ible in a &s;till wor&s;e condition from his projects of cure than he repre&s;ents us from our original di&s;orders.</P>
<P>Before we examine into the con&s;equence of the&s;e &s;chemes, and the probability of the&s;e &s;avings, let us &s;uppo&s;e them all real and all &s;afe, and then &s;ee what it is they amount to, and how he rea&s;ons on them:

This is the amount of the only articles of &s;aving he &s;peci&s;ies; and yet <MILESTONE N="43" UNIT="P."> he choo&s;es to a&s;&s;ert <Q>that we may venture on the credit of them to re|duce the &s;tanding expences of the e&s;timate (from &pound;. 3.468.161) to &pound;. 3.300.000;</Q> that is, for a &s;aving of &pound;. 58.000, he is not a&s;hamed to take credit for a defalcation from his own ideal e&s;tabli&s;hment in a &s;um of no le&s;s than &pound;. 168.161! Suppo&s;e even that we were to take up the e&s;timate of the Con&s;iderations (which is however abandoned in the State of the Nation), and reduce his &pound;. 75.000 extraordinaries to the original &pound;. 35.000. Still all the&s;e &s;avings joined together give us but &pound;. 98.000; that is, near &pound;. 70.000 &s;hort of the credit he calls for, and for which he has neither given any rea&s;on, or furni&s;hed any data what&s;oever for others to rea&s;on upon.</P>
<P>Such are his &s;avings, as operating on his own project of a peace e&s;ta|bli&s;hment. Let us now con&s;ider them as they affect the exi&s;ting e&s;tabli&s;h|ment and our actual &s;ervices. He tells us, the &s;um allowed in his e&s;ti|mate for the navy is <Q>&pound;. 69.321 le&s;s than the grant for that &s;ervice in 1767; but in that grant &pound;. 30.000 was included for the purcha&s;e of
<PB N="47" REF="48">
hemp, and a &s;aving of about &pound;. 25.000 was made in that year.</Q> The author has got &s;ome &s;ecret in arithmetick. The&s;e two &s;ums put toge|ther amount, in the ordinary way of computing, to &pound;. 55.000, and not to &pound;. 69.321. On what principle has he cho&s;en to take credit for &pound;. 14.321 more? To what this &s;trange inaccuracy is owing, I cannot po&s;&s;ibly comprehend; nor is it very material, where the logic is &s;o bad, and the policy &s;o erroneous, whether the arithmetic be ju&s;t or otherwi&s;e. But in a &s;cheme for making this nation <Q>happy at home and re&s;pected abroad, formidable in war and flouri&s;hing in peace,</Q> it is &s;urely a little unfortunate for us, that he has picked out the <HI>Navy,</HI> as the very fir&s;t object of his oeconomical experiments. Of all the public &s;ervices, that of the navy is the one in which tampering may be of the greate&s;t dan|ger, which can wor&s;t be &s;upplied upon an emergency, and of which any failure draws after it the longe&s;t and heavie&s;t train of con&s;equences. I am far from &s;aying, that this or any &s;ervice ought not to be conducted with oeconomy. But I will never &s;uffer the &s;acred name of oeconomy to be be&s;towed upon arbitrary defalcation of charge. The author tells us him&s;elf, <Q>that to &s;uffer the navy to rot in harbour for want of repairs and marines, would be to invite de&s;truction.</Q> It would &s;o. When the author talks therefore of &s;avings on the navy e&s;timate, it is incumbent on him to let us know, not what &s;ums he will cut off, but what branch of that &s;ervice he deems &s;uperfluous. In&s;tead of putting us off with un|meaning generalities, he ought to have &s;tated what naval force, what na|val works, and what naval &s;tores, with the lowe&s;t e&s;timated expence, are nece&s;&s;ary to keep our marine in a condition commen&s;urate to its great ends. And this too not for the contracted and deceitful &s;pace of a &s;ingle year, but for &s;ome rea&s;onable term. Every body knows that many charges can|not be in their nature regular or annual. In the year 1767 a &s;tock of hemp, &amp;c. was to be laid in; that charge intermits, but it does not end. Other charges of other kinds take their place. Great works are now carrying on at Port&s;mouth, but not of greater magnitude than utility; and they mu&s;t be provided for. A year's e&s;timate is therefore no ju&s;t idea at all of a permanent peace e&s;tabli&s;hment. Had the author opened this matter upon the&s;e plain principles, a judgment might have been formed, how far he had contrived to reconcile national defence with public oeconomy. Till he has done it, tho&s;e who had rather depend on any man's rea&s;on than the greate&s;t man's authority, will not give him credit on this head for the &s;aving of a &s;ingle &s;hilling. As to tho&s;e &s;avings which are already made, or in cour&s;e of being made, whether right or wrong, he has nothing at all to do with them; they can be no part of his project, con&s;idered as a plan of reformation. I greatly fear that the error has not lately been on the &s;ide of profu&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="49">
Another head is the &s;aving on the Army and Ordnance extraordinaries, particularly in the American branch. What or how much reduction may be made, none of us, I believe, can with any fairne&s;s pretend to &s;ay; very little, I am convinced. The &s;tate of America is extremely un&s;ettled; more troops have been &s;ent thither; new di&s;po&s;itions have been made; and this augmentation of number, and change of di&s;po&s;ition, has rarely, I believe, the effect of le&s;&s;ening the bill for extraordinaries, which, if not this year, yet in the next, we mu&s;t certainly feel. Care has not been wanting to introduce oeconomy into that part of the &s;ervice. The au|thor's great friend has made, I admit, &s;ome regulations; his immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors have made more, and better. This part will be handled more ably and more minutely at another time; but none can cut down this bill of extraordinaries at his plea&s;ure. The author has given us nothing, but his word, for any certain or con&s;iderable reduction; and this we ought to be the more cautious in taking, as he has promi&s;ed great &s;avings in his <HI>Con&s;iderations,</HI> which he has not cho&s;en to abide by in his <HI>State of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>On this head al&s;o of the American extraordinaries, he can take credit for nothing. As to his next, the le&s;&s;ening of the deficiency of the land and malt-tax, particularly of the malt-tax; any per&s;on the lea&s;t conver|&s;ant in that &s;ubject cannot avoid a &s;mile. This deficiency ari&s;es from charge of collection, from anticipation, and from defective produce. What has the author &s;aid on the reduction of any head of this deficiency upon the land tax? On the&s;e points he is ab&s;olutely &s;ilent. As to the deficiency on the malt tax, which is chiefly owing to a defective produce, he has, and can have, nothing to propo&s;e. If this deficiency &s;hould be le&s;|&s;ened by the encrea&s;e of malting in any years more than others (as it is a greatly fluctuating object), how much of this obligation &s;hall we owe to this author's mini&s;try? will it not be the ca&s;e under any admini&s;tration? mu&s;t it not go to the general &s;ervice of the year, in &s;ome way or other, let the finances be in who&s;e hands they will? But why take credit for &s;o extremely reduced a deficiency at all? I can tell him he has no rational ground for it in the produce of the year 1767, and I &s;u&s;pect will have full as little rea&s;on from the produce of the year 1768. That produce may indeed become greater, and the deficiency of cour&s;e will be le&s;s. It may too be far otherwi&s;e. A fair and judicious financier will not, as this wri|ter has done, for the &s;ake of making out a &s;pecious account, &s;elect a fa|vourable year or two, at remote periods, and ground his calculations on tho&s;e. In 1768 he will not take the deficiencies of 1753 and 1754 for his &s;tandard. Sober men have hitherto (and mu&s;t continue this cour&s;e to pre|&s;erve this character) taken indifferently the mediums of the years imme|diately preceding. But a per&s;on who has a &s;cheme from which he pro|mi&s;es
<PB N="49" REF="50">
much to the publick ought to be &s;till more cautious; he would choo&s;e to ground his &s;peculation rather on the lowe&s;t mediums; becau&s;e all new &s;chemes are known to be &s;ubject to &s;ome defect or failure not fore&s;een; and which therefore every prudent propo&s;er will be ready to allow for, in order to lay his foundation as low and as &s;olid as po&s;&s;ible. Quite contrary is the practice of &s;ome politicians. They fir&s;t propo&s;e &s;avings, which they well know cannot be made, in order to get a reputa|tion for oeconomy. In due time they a&s;&s;ume another, but a different me|rit, by providing for the &s;ervice they had before cut off or &s;traitened, and which they can then very ea&s;ily prove to be nece&s;&s;ary. In the &s;ame &s;pirit, they rai&s;e magnificent ideas of revenue on funds which they know to be in&s;ufficient. Afterwards, who can blame them, if they do not &s;atisfy the public de&s;ires? They are great artificers; but they cannot work without materials.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome of the little arts of great &s;tate&s;men. To &s;uch we leave them, and follow where the author leads us, to his next re&s;ource, the Foundling-ho&s;pital. Whatever particular virtue there is in the mode of this &s;aving, there &s;eems to be nothing at all new, and indeed nothing won|derfully important in it. The &s;um annually voted for the &s;upport of the Foundling-ho&s;pital has been in a former parliament limited to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the children then in the ho&s;pital. When they are ap|prenticed, this provi&s;ion will cea&s;e. It will therefore fall in more or le&s;s at different times; and will at length cea&s;e intirely. But, until it does, we cannot reckon upon it as the &s;aving on the e&s;tabli&s;hment of any given year: nor can any one conceive how the author comes to mention this, any more than &s;ome other articles, as a part of a <HI>new</HI> plan of oeconomy which is to retrieve our affairs. This charge will indeed cea&s;e in its own time. But will no other &s;ucceed to it? Has he ever known the publick free from &s;ome contingent charge, either for the ju&s;t &s;upport of royal dig|nity, or for national magnificence, or for public charity, or for public &s;ervice? does he choo&s;e to flatter his readers that no &s;uch will ever re|turn? or does he in good earne&s;t declare, that let the rea&s;on, or nece&s;&s;ity, be what they will, he is re&s;olved not to provide for &s;uch &s;ervices?</P>
<P>Another re&s;ource of oeconomy yet remains, for the gleans the field very clo&s;ely, &pound;. 1. 800 for the American &s;urveys. Why what &s;ignifies a di&s;pute about trifles? he &s;hall have it. But while he is carrying it off, I &s;hall ju&s;t whi&s;per in his ear, that neither the &s;aving that is allowed, or that which is doubted of, can at all belong to that future propo&s;ed admi|&s;tration, who&s;e touch is to cure all our evils. Both the one and the other belong equally (as indeed all the re&s;t do) to the pre&s;ent admini|&s;tration, to any admini&s;tration; becau&s;e they are the gift of time, and not the bounty of the exchequer.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="51">
I have now done with all the minor preparatory parts of the au|thor's &s;cheme, the &s;everal articles of &s;aving which he propo&s;es. At length comes the capital operation, his new re&s;ources. Three hun|dred thou&s;and pounds a year from America and Ireland.&mdash;Alas! alas! if that too &s;hould fail us, what will become of this poor undone nation? The author, in a tone of great humility, <HI>hopes</HI> they may be <HI>induced</HI> to pay it. Well, if that be all, we may hope &s;o too: and for any light he is plea&s;ed to give us into the ground of this hope, and the ways and means of this inducement, here is a &s;peedy end both of the que&s;tion and the revenue.</P>
<P>It is the con&s;tant cu&s;tom of this author, in all his writings, to take it for granted, that he has given you a revenue, whenever he can point out to you where you may have money, if you can contrive how to get at it; and this &s;eems to be the ma&s;ter-piece of his financial ability. I think however, in his way of proceeding, he has behaved rather like an har&s;h &s;tep-dame, than a kind nur&s;ing mother to his country. Why &s;top at &pound;. 300, 000? If his &s;tate of things be at all founded, America and Ireland are much better able to pay &pound;. 600, 000, than we are to &s;atisfy our|&s;elves with half that &s;um. However, let us forgive him this one in|&s;tance of tenderne&s;s towards Ireland and the colonies.</P>
<P>He &s;pends a va&s;t deal of time, in an endeavour to prove, that Ireland is able to bear greater impo&s;itions. He is of opinion, that the poverty <MILESTONE N="35" UNIT="P."> of the lower cla&s;s of people there is, in a great mea&s;ure, owing to <HI>a want</HI> of judicious taxes; that a land tax will enrich her tenants; that taxes are paid in England which are not paid there; that the colony trade is encrea&s;ed above &pound;. 100. 000 &s;ince the peace; that &s;he <HI>ought</HI> to have further indulgences in that trade; and <HI>ought</HI> to have further privileges in the woollen manufacture. From the&s;e premi&s;es, of what &s;he has, what &s;he has not, and what &s;he ought to have, he infers that Ireland will contribute &pound;. 100. 000 towards the extraordinaries of the American e&s;ta|bli&s;hment.</P>
<P>I &s;hall make no objections what&s;oever, logical or financial, to this rea|&s;oning: many occur; but they would lead me from my purpo&s;e, from which I do not intend to be diverted, becau&s;e it &s;eems to me of no &s;mall importance. It will be ju&s;t enough to hint, what I dare &s;ay many readers have before ob&s;erved, that when any man propo&s;es new taxes in a country with which he is not per&s;onally conver&s;ant by re&s;idence or office, he ought to lay open its &s;ituation much more minutely and critically than this author has done, or than perhaps he is able to do. He ought not to content him&s;elf with &s;aying that a &s;ingle article of her trade is encrea&s;ed &pound;. 100. 000 a year; he ought, if he argues from the encrea&s;e of trade to an encrea&s;e of taxes, to &s;tate the whole trade, and not one branch of
<PB N="51" REF="52">
trade only, he ought to enter fully into the &s;tate of its remittances, and the cour&s;e of its exchange, he ought likewi&s;e to examine whether all its e&s;tabli&s;hments are encrea&s;ed or dimini&s;hed; and whether it incurs or di&s;charges debt annually. But I pa&s;s over all this; and am content to a&s;k a few plain que&s;tions.</P>
<P>Does the author then &s;eriou&s;ly mean to propo&s;e in parliament a land tax, or any tax for &pound;. 100. 000 a year upon Ireland? If he does, and that fatally, by his temerity and our weakne&s;s, he &s;hould &s;ucceed, then I &s;ay he will throw the whole empire from one end of it to the other into mor|tal convul&s;ions. What is it that can &s;atisfy the furious and perturbed mind of this man? is it not enough for him that &s;uch projects have alienated our colonies from the mother country, and not to propo&s;e violently to tear our &s;i&s;ter kingdom al&s;o from our &s;ide, and to convince every de|pendent part of the empire, that, when a little money is to be rai&s;ed, we have no &s;ort of regard to their antient cu&s;toms, their opinions, their circum&s;tances, or their affections? He has however a <HI>douceur</HI> for Ireland in his pocket; benefits in trade, by opening the woollen manufacture to that nation. A very right idea in my opinion; but not more &s;trong in rea&s;on, than likely to be oppo&s;ed by the mo&s;t powerful and mo&s;t violent of all local prejudices and popular pa&s;&s;ions. Fir&s;t, a fire is already kindled by his &s;chemes of taxation in America; he then propo&s;es one which will &s;et all Ireland in a blaze; and his way of quenching both is by a plan which may kindle perhaps ten times a greater flame in Britain.</P>
<P>Will the author pledge him&s;elf, previous to his propo&s;al of &s;uch a tax, to carry this enlargement of the Iri&s;h trade? if he does not, then the tax will be certain; the benefit will be le&s;s than problematical. In this view, his compen&s;ation to Ireland vani&s;hes into &s;moke; the tax, to their pre|judices, will appear &s;tark naked in the light of an act of arbitrary power and oppre&s;&s;ion. But, if he &s;hould propo&s;e the benefit and tax together, then the people of Ireland, a very high and &s;pirited people, would think it the wor&s;t bargain in the world. They would look upon the one as wholly vitiated and poi&s;oned by the other; and, if they could not be &s;e|parated, would infallibly re&s;i&s;t them both together. Here would be taxes indeed, amounting to an hand&s;ome &s;um; &pound;. 100. 000 very effectually voted, and pa&s;&s;ed through the be&s;t and mo&s;t authentic forms; but how to be collected?&mdash;This is his perpetual manner. One of his projects depends for &s;ucce&s;s upon another project, and this upon a third, all of them equally vi&s;ionary. His finance is like the Indian philo&s;ophy; his Earth is poi&s;ed on the horns of a Bull, his Bull &s;tands on an Elephant, his Ele|phant is &s;upported by a Tortoi&s;e; and &s;o on for ever.</P>
<P>As to his American &pound;. 200. 000 a year, he is &s;atisfied to repeat gravely, as he has done an hundred times before, that the Americans are able to
<PB N="52" REF="53">
pay it. Well, and what then? does he lay open any part of his plan how they may be compelled to pay it, without plunging our&s;elves into cala|mities that outweigh ten fold the propo&s;ed benefit? or does he &s;hew how they may be induced to &s;ubmit to it quietly? or does he give any thing like &s;atisfaction concerning the mode of levying it, in commercial colonies one of the mo&s;t important and difficult of all con&s;iderations? Nothing like it. To the &s;tamp act, whatever its excellencies may be, I think he will not in reality recur, or even choo&s;e to a&s;&s;ert that he means to do &s;o, in ca&s;e his mini&s;ter &s;hould come again into power. If he does, I will predict that &s;ome of the fa&s;te&s;t friends of that mini&s;ter will de&s;ert him upon this point. As to port duties, he has damned them all in the lump, by declaring them <Q>contrary to the fir&s;t principles of coloni|zation, and not le&s;s prejudicial to the intere&s;ts of Great Britain than to <MILESTONE N="37" UNIT="P."> tho&s;e of the colonies.</Q> Surely this &s;ingle ob&s;ervation of his, ought to have taught him a little caution; he ought to have begun to doubt, whe|ther there is not &s;omething in the nature of commercial colonies, which renders them an unfit object of taxation; when port duties, &s;o large a fund of revenue in almo&s;t all countries, are by him&s;elf found, in this ca&s;e, not only improper, but de&s;tructive. However, he has here pretty well nar|rowed the field of taxation. Stamp act, hardly to be re&s;umed. Port duties, mi&s;chievous. Exci&s;es, I believe he will &s;carcely think worth the collection (if any revenue &s;hould be &s;o) in America. Land tax (not|with&s;tanding his opinion of its immen&s;e u&s;e to agriculture), he will not directly propo&s;e, before he has thought again and again on the &s;ubject. Indeed he very readily recommends it for Ireland, and &s;eems to think it not improper for America; becau&s;e, he ob&s;erves, they already rai&s;e mo&s;t of their taxes internally, including this tax. A mo&s;t curious rea&s;on truly! becau&s;e their lands are already heavily burthened, he thinks it right to burthen them &s;till further. But he will recollect, for &s;urely he cannot be ignorant of it, that the lands of America are not, as in England, let at a rent certain in money, and therefore cannot, as here, be taxed at a certain pound rate. They value them in gro&s;s among them&s;elves; and none but them&s;elves in their &s;everal di&s;tricts can value them. Without their hearty concurrence and cooperation, it is evident we cannot advance a &s;tep in the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing or collecting any land tax. As to the taxes which in &s;ome places the Americans pay by the acre, they are merely duties of regula|tion; they are &s;mall; and to encrea&s;e them, notwith&s;tanding the &s;ecret virtues of a land tax, would be the mo&s;t effectual means of preventing that cultivation they are intended to promote. Be&s;ides, the whole coun|try is heavily in arrear already for land taxes and quit rents. They have different methods of taxation in the different provinces, agreeable to their &s;everal local circum&s;tances. In New England by far the

greate&s;t part of their revenue is rai&s;ed by <HI>faculty taxes</HI> and <HI>capitations.</HI> Such is the method in many others. It is obvious that parliament, una&s;|&s;i&s;ted by the colonies them&s;elves, cannot take &s;o much as a &s;ingle &s;tep in this mode of taxation. Then what tax is it he will impo&s;e? Why, after all the boa&s;ting &s;peeches and writings of his faction for the&s;e four years, after all the vain expectations which they have held out to a deluded pub|lick, this their great advocate, after twi&s;ting the &s;ubject every way, after writhing him&s;elf into every po&s;ture, after knocking at every door, is obliged fairly to abandon every mode of taxation what&s;oever in America. He thinks it the be&s;t method for parliament to impo&s;e the &s;um, and re&s;erve <MILESTONE N="37, 38." UNIT="P."> the account to it&s;elf, leaving the mode of taxation to the colonies. But how and in what proportions? what does the author &s;ay? O, not a &s;ingle &s;ylla|ble on this the mo&s;t material part of the whole que&s;tion. Will he, in parliament, undertake to &s;ettle the proportions of &s;uch payments from Nova Scotia to Nevis, in no fewer than &s;ix and twenty different countries, varying in almo&s;t every po&s;&s;ible circum&s;tance one from another? if he does, I tell him, he adjourns his revenue to a very long day. If he leaves it to them&s;elves to &s;ettle the&s;e proportions, he adjourns it to dooms-day.</P>
<P>Then what does he get by this method on the &s;ide of acquie&s;cence? will the people of America reli&s;h this cour&s;e, of giving and granting and applying their money, the better becau&s;e their a&s;&s;emblies are made commi&s;&s;ioners of the taxes? This is far wor&s;e than all his former projects; for here, if the a&s;&s;emblies &s;hall refu&s;e, or delay, or be negligent, or fraudulent, in this new|impo&s;ed duty, we are wholly without remedy; and neither our cu&s;tom|hou&s;e officers, nor our troops, nor our armed &s;hips, can be of the lea&s;t u&s;e in the collection. Nothing can be a more contemptible idea (I will not call it an oppre&s;&s;ive one, the har&s;hne&s;s is lo&s;t in the folly) than that of propo&s;ing to get any revenue from the Americans but by their free&s;t and mo&s;t chearful con|&s;ent. Mo&s;t monied men know their own intere&s;t right well; and are as able, as any financier, in the valuation of ri&s;ques. Yet I think this financier will &s;carcely find that adventurer hardy enough, at any premium, to ad|vance a &s;hilling upon a vote of &s;uch taxes. Let him name the man, or &s;et of men, that would do it. This is the only proof of the value of reve|nues; what would an intere&s;ted man rate them at? His &s;ub&s;cription would be at ninety nine <HI>per cent.</HI> di&s;count the very fir&s;t day of its opening. Here is our only national &s;ecurity from ruin; a &s;ecurity upon which no man in his &s;en&s;es would venture a &s;hilling of his fortune. Yet he puts down tho&s;e articles as gravely in his &s;upply for his peace e&s;tabli&s;hment, as if the money had been all fairly lodged in the exchequer.</P>

Very hand&s;ome indeed&punc; but if &s;upply is to be got in &s;uch a manner, fare|well the lucrative my&s;tery of finance! If you are to be credited for &s;avings, without &s;hewing how, why, or with what &s;afety, they are to be made; and for revenues, without &s;pecifying on what articles, or by what means, or at what expence, they are to be collected; there is not a clerk in a public office who may not outbid this author, or his friend, for the de|partment of chancellor of the exchequer; not an apprentice in the city, that will not &s;trike out, with the &s;ame advantages, the &s;ame, or a much larger, plan of &s;upply.</P>
<P>Here is the whole of what belongs to the author's &s;cheme for &s;aving us from impending de&s;truction. Take it even in its mo&s;t favourable point of view, as a thing within po&s;&s;ibility; and imagine what mu&s;t be the wi&s;dom of this gentleman, or his opinion of ours, who could fir&s;t think of repre&s;enting this nation in &s;uch a &s;tate, as no friend can look upon but with horror, and &s;carce an enemy without compa&s;&s;ion, and afterwards of diverting him&s;elf with &s;uch inadequate, impracticable, puerile methods for our relief? If the&s;e had been the dreams of &s;ome unknown, unnamed, and namele&s;s writer, they would excite no alarm; their weakne&s;s had been an antidote to their malignity. But as they are univer&s;ally believed to be written by the hand, or, what amounts to the &s;ame thing, under the immediate direction, of a per&s;on who has been in the management of the highe&s;t affairs, and may &s;oon be in the &s;ame &s;ituation, I think it is not to be reckoned among&s;t our greate&s;t con&s;olations, that the yet remaining power of this kingdom is to be employed in an attempt to realize notions, that are at once &s;o frivolous, and &s;o full of danger. That con&s;ideration will ju&s;tify me in dwelling a little longer on the difficulties of the nation, and the &s;olutions of our author.</P>
<P>I am then per&s;uaded that he cannot be in the lea&s;t alarmed about our &s;ituation, let his outcry be what he plea&s;es. I will give him a rea&s;on for my opinion, which, I think, he cannot di&s;pute. All that he be&s;tows upon the nation, which it does not po&s;&s;e&s;s without him, and &s;uppo&s;ing it all &s;ure money, amounts to no more than a &s;um of &pound;. 300.000 a year. This, he thinks, will do the bu&s;ine&s;s compleatly, and render us flouri&s;hing at home, and re&s;pectable abroad. If the option between glory and &s;hame, if our &s;alvation or de&s;truction, depended on this &s;um, it is impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould have been active, and made a merit of that activity, in taking off a &s;hilling in the pound of the land tax, which came up to his grand de&s;ideratum, and upwards of &pound;. 100.000 more. By this manoeuvre he left our trade, navigation and manufactures on the verge of de&s;truction, our finances in ruin, our credit expiring, Ireland on the point of being ceded to France, the colonies of being torn to pieces, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown at the mercy of our great rival, and
<PB N="55" REF="56">
the kingdom it&s;elf on the very point of becoming tributary to that haugh|ty power. All this for want of &pound;. 300.000; for I defy the reader to point out any other revenue, or any other preci&s;e and defined &s;cheme of politics, which he a&s;&s;igns for our redemption.</P>
<P>I know that two things may be &s;aid in his defence, as bad rea&s;ons are always at hand in an indifferent cau&s;e, that he was not &s;ure the money would be applied as he thinks it ought to be, by the pre&s;ent mini&s;ters. I think as ill of them, as he does to the full. They have done very near as much mi&s;chief as they can do, to a con&s;titution &s;o robu&s;t as this. Nothing can make them more dangerous, but that as they are already in general compo&s;ed of his di&s;ciples and in&s;truments, they may add to the public calamity of their own mea&s;ures, the adoption of his projects. But be the mini&s;ters what they may, the author knows that they could not avoid applying this &pound;. 450.000 to the &s;er|vice of the e&s;tabli&s;hment, as faithfully as he, or any other mini&s;ter, could do. I &s;ay they could not avoid it, and have no merit at all for the application. But &s;uppo&s;ing that they &s;hould greatly mi&s;manage this reve|nue. Here is a good deal of room for mi&s;take and prodigality before you come to the edge of ruin. The difference between the amount of that real, and his imaginary revenue is, &pound;. 150.000 a year, at lea&s;t; a tolerable &s;um for them to play with: and this, in one article, might compen&s;ate the difference between the author's oeconomy, and their profu&s;ion; and &s;till, notwith&s;tanding their vices and ignorance, the nation might be &s;aved. The author ought al&s;o to recollect, that a good man would hardly deny, even to the wor&s;t of mini&s;ters, the means of doing their duty; e&s;pecially in a cri&s;is when our being depended on &s;upplying them with &s;ome means or other. In &s;uch a ca&s;e their penury of mind, in di&s;covering re&s;ources, would make it rather the more nece&s;&s;ary, not to &s;trip &s;uch poor providers of the little &s;tock they had in hand.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, here is another &s;ubject of di&s;tre&s;s, and a very &s;erious one, which puts us again to a &s;tand. The author may po&s;&s;ibly not come into power (I only &s;tate the po&s;&s;ibility); he may not always continue in it: and if the contrary to all this &s;hould fortunately for us happen, what in|&s;urance on his life can be made for a &s;um adequate to his lo&s;s? Then we are thus unluckily &s;ituated, that the <HI>chance</HI> of an American and Iri&s;h re|venue of &pound;. 300.000 to be managed by him, is to &s;ave us from ruin two or three years hence at be&s;t, to make us happy at home and glorious abroad; and the actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &pound;. 450.000 Engli&s;h taxes cannot &s;o much as protract our ruin without him. <HI>Propria haec &s;i dona fui&s;&s;ent!</HI> So we are &s;taked on four chances; his power, its permanence, the &s;uc|ce&s;s of his projects, and the duration of his life. Any one of the&s;e failing,
<PB N="56" REF="57">
we are gone. This is no unfair repre&s;entation; ultimately all hangs on his life, becau&s;e, in his account of every &s;et of men that have held or &s;upported admini&s;tration, he finds neither virtue or ability in any but him&s;elf. Indeed he pays (through their mea&s;ures) &s;ome compliments to Lord Bute and Lord De&s;pen&s;er. But to the latter, this is, I &s;uppo&s;e, but a civility to old acquaintance; to the former, a little &s;troke of poli|ticks. We may therefore fairly &s;ay, that our only hope is his life; and he has, to make it the more &s;o, taken care to cut off any re&s;ource which we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed independent of him.</P>
<P>In the next place it may be &s;aid, to excu&s;e any appearance of incon&s;i&s;t|ency between the author's actions and his declarations, that he thought it right to relieve the landed intere&s;t, and lay the burthen, where it ought to lie, on the colonies. What to take off a revenue &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to our being, before any thing what&s;oever was acquired in the place of it? In prudence he ought to have waited at lea&s;t for the fir&s;t quarter's receipt of the new anonymous American revenue, and Iri&s;h land tax. Is there &s;omething &s;o &s;pecific for our di&s;orders in American, and &s;omething &s;o poi&s;onous in Eng|li&s;h money, that one is to heal, the other to de&s;troy us? To &s;ay that the landed intere&s;t <HI>could</HI> not continue to pay it for a year or two longer, is more than the author will attempt to prove. To &s;ay that they <HI>would</HI> pay it no longer, is to treat the landed intere&s;t, in my opinion, very &s;curvily. To &s;uppo&s;e that the gentry, clergy, and freeholders of England do not rate the commerce, the credit, the religion, the liberty, the independency of their country, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of their crown, at a &s;hilling in the pound land tax! They never gave him rea&s;on to think &s;o meanly of them. And if I am rightly informed, when that mea&s;ure was debated in parlia|ment, a very different rea&s;on was a&s;&s;igned by the author's great friend, as well as by others, for that reduction: one very different from the critical and almo&s;t de&s;perate &s;tate of our finances. Some people then endeavoured to prove, that the reduction might be made without detriment to the national credit, or the due &s;upport of a proper peace e&s;tabli&s;hment; otherwi&s;e it is obvious that the reduction could not be defended in argument. So that this author cannot de&s;pair &s;o much of the commonwealth without this American and Iri&s;h revenue, as he pretends to do. If he does, the reader &s;ees how hand&s;omely he has provided for us, by voting away one reve|nue, and by giving us a pamphlet on the other.</P>
<P>I do not mean to blame the relief which was then given by parliament to the land. It was grounded on very weighty rea&s;ons. The admini|&s;tration contended only for its continuance for a year, in order to have the merit of taking off the &s;hilling in the pound immediately before the elections; and thus to bribe the freeholders of England with their own money.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="58">
It is true the author, in his e&s;timate of ways and means, takes credit for &pound;. 400. 000 a year, <HI>Indian revenue.</HI> But he will not very po&s;itively in&s;i&s;t, that we &s;hould put this revenue to the account of his plans or his power; and for a pretty plain rea&s;on: we are already near two years in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. By what means we came to that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, is a pretty long &s;tory; however, I &s;hall give nothing more than a &s;hort ab&s;tract of the proceeding, in order to &s;ee whether the author will take to him&s;elf any part in that mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The fact is this; the Ea&s;t India company had for a good while &s;ollicited the mini&s;try for a negotiation, by which they propo&s;ed to pay largely for &s;ome advantages in their trade, and for the renewal of their charter. This had been the former method of tran&s;acting with that body. Government having only lea&s;ed the monopoly for &s;hort terms, the company has been obliged to re&s;ort to it frequently for renewals. The&s;e two parties had always negotiated (on the true principle of credit) not as government and &s;ubject, but as equal dealers, on the footing of mutual advantage. The public had derived great benefit from &s;uch dealing. But at that time new ideas prevailed. The mini&s;try, in&s;tead of li&s;tening to the propo&s;als of that company, cho&s;e to &s;et up a claim of the crown to their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. The original plan &s;eems to have been, to get the hou&s;e of commons to compli|ment the crown with a &s;ort of juridical declaration of a title to the company's acqui&s;itions in India; which the crown, on its part, with the be&s;t air in the world, was to be&s;tow upon the public. Then it would come to the turn of the hou&s;e of commons again to be liberal and grateful to the crown. The civil li&s;t debts were to be paid off; with perhaps a pretty augmentation of income. All this was to be done on the mo&s;t public-&s;pirited principles, and with a politene&s;s and mutual interchange of good offices, that could not but have charmed. But, what was be&s;t of all, the&s;e civilities were to be without a farthing of charge to either of the kind and obliging parties.&mdash;The Ea&s;t India company was to be covered with infamy and di&s;grace, and at the &s;ame time was to pay the whole bill.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this &s;cheme, the terrors of a parliamentary enquiry were hung over them. A judicature was a&s;&s;erted in parliament to try this que&s;tion. But, le&s;t this judicial character &s;hould chance to in&s;pire certain &s;tubborn ideas of law and right, it was argued, that the judicature was arbitrary, and ought not to determine by the rules of law, but by their opinion of policy and expediency. Nothing exceeded the violence of &s;ome of the managers, except their impotence. They were bewildered by their pa&s;&s;ions, and by their want of knowledge or want of con&s;ideration of the &s;ubject. The more they advanced, the further they found them&s;elves from their object.&mdash;All things ran into confu&s;ion. The mini&s;ters quarrelled among them&s;elves. They di&s;claimed one another. They &s;u&s;pended vio|lence, and &s;hrunk from treaty. The inquiry was almo&s;t at its la&s;t ga&s;p;
<PB N="58" REF="59">
when &s;ome active per&s;ons of the company were given to under&s;tand, that this ho&s;tile proceeding was only &s;et up in <HI>in terrorem;</HI> that government was far from an intention of &s;eizing upon the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the company. Admini&s;tration, they &s;aid, was &s;en&s;ible, that the idea was in every light full of ab&s;urdity; and that &s;uch a &s;eizure was not more out of their power, than remote from their wi&s;hes; and therefore, if the company would come in a liberal manner to the hou&s;e, they certainly could not fail of putting a &s;peedy end to this di&s;agreeable bu&s;ine&s;s, and of opening the way to an advantageous treaty.</P>
<P>On this hint the company acted: they came at once to a re&s;olution of getting rid of the difficulties which aro&s;e from the complication of their trade with their revenue; a &s;tep which de&s;poiled them of their be&s;t defen|&s;ive armour, and put them at once into the power of admini&s;tration. They threw their whole &s;tock of every kind, the revenues, the trade, and even their debt from government, into one fund, which they computed on the &s;ure&s;t grounds would amount to &pound;. 800.000, with a large probable &s;urplus for the payment of debt. Then they agreed to divide this &s;um in equal por|tions between them&s;elves and the public, &pound;. 400.000 to each. This gave to the proprietors of that fund an annual augmentation of no more than &pound;. 80.000 dividend. They ought to receive from government &pound;. 120.000 for the loan of their capital. So that in fact the whole, which on this plan they re&s;erved to them&s;elves, from their va&s;t revenues, from their exten&s;ive trade, and in con&s;ideration of the great ri&s;ques and mighty expences which pur|cha&s;ed the&s;e advantages, amounted to no more than &pound;. 280.000, whil&s;t government was to receive, as I &s;aid, &pound;. 400.000.</P>
<P>This propo&s;al was thought by them&s;elves liberal indeed; and they expected the highe&s;t applau&s;es for it. However, their reception was very different from their expectations. When they brought up their plan to the hou&s;e of commons, the offer, as it was natural, of &pound;. 400.000, was very well reli&s;hed. But nothing could be more di&s;gu&s;tful than the &pound;. 80.000 which the company had divided among&s;t them&s;elves. A violent tempe&s;t of public indignation and fury ro&s;e again&s;t them. The heads of people turned. The company was held well able to pay &pound;. 400.000 a year to government; but bankrupts, if they attempted to divide the fifth part of it among them|&s;elves. An <HI>ex po&s;t facto</HI> law was brought in with great precipitation, for an|nulling this dividend. In the bill was in&s;erted a clau&s;e, which &s;u&s;pended for about a year the right, which, under the public faith, the company enjoyed, of making their own dividends. Such was the di&s;po&s;ition and temper of the hou&s;e, that, although the plain face of facts, rea&s;on, arithmetic, all the authority, parts, and eloquence in the kingdom, were again&s;t this bill; though all the chancellors of the exchequer, who had held that office from the beginning of this reign, oppo&s;ed it, yet, a few placemen
<PB N="59" REF="60">
of the &s;ubordinate departments &s;prung out of their ranks, took the lead, and, by an opinion <HI>of &s;ome &s;ort of &s;ecret &s;upport,</HI> carried the bill with an high hand, leaving the then &s;ecretary of &s;tate, and the chancellor of the exchequer, in a very moderate minority. In this di&s;tracted &s;ituation, the managers of the bill, notwith&s;tanding their triumph, did not venture to propo&s;e the payment of the civil li&s;t debt. The chancellor of the exchequer was not in good humour enough, after his late defeat by his own troops, to cooperate in &s;uch a de&s;ign; &s;o they made an act, to lock up the money in the exchequer until they &s;hould have time to look about them, and &s;ettle among them&s;elves what they are to do with it.</P>
<P>Thus ended this unparalleled tran&s;action. The author, I believe, will not claim any part of the glory of it: he will leave it whole and entire to the authors of the mea&s;ure. The money was the voluntary free gift of the company; the re&s;cinding bill was the act of legi&s;lature, to which they and we owe &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion: the author has nothing to do with the one or with the other. However, he cannot avoid rubbing him&s;elf again&s;t this &s;ubject, merely for the plea&s;ure of &s;tirring controver&s;ies, and grati|fying a certain pruriency of taxation that &s;eems to infect his blood. It is merely to indulge him&s;elf in &s;peculations of taxing, that he choo&s;es to harangue on this &s;ubject. For he takes credit for no greater &s;um than the public is already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of. He does not hint, that the company means, or has ever &s;hewn any di&s;po&s;ition, if managed with common pru|dence, to pay le&s;s in future; and he cannot doubt that the pre&s;ent mini&s;try are as well inclined to drive them, by their mock enquiries, and real re&s;cind|ing bills, as he can po&s;&s;ibly be with his taxes. Be&s;ides, it is obvious, that as great a &s;um might have been drawn from that company, without affecting property, or &s;haking the con&s;titution, or endangering the principle of public credit, or running into his golden dreams of cockets on the Ganges, or vi&s;ions of &s;tamp duties on <HI>Perwanna's, Du&s;tucks, Ki&s;tbundees,</HI> and <HI>Hu&s;bulhookums.</HI> For once, I will di&s;appoint him in this part of the di&s;pute, and only in a very few words recommend to his con&s;ideration, how he is to get off the dangerous idea of taxing a public fund, if he levies tho&s;e duties in England; and if he is to levy them in India, what provi&s;ion he has made for a revenue e&s;tabli&s;hment there; &s;uppo&s;ing that he undertakes this new &s;cheme of finance independently of the company, and again&s;t its inclinations.</P>
<P>So much for the revenues, which are nothing but his vi&s;ions, or already the national po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions without any act of his. It is ea&s;y to parade with an high talk of parliamentary rights, of the univer&s;ality of legi&s;lative powers, and of uniform taxation. Men of &s;en&s;e, when new projects come before them, always think, a di&s;cour&s;e proving the mere right or mere power of acting in the manner propo&s;ed, to be no more than a very un|plea&s;ant way of mi&s;pending time. They mu&s;t &s;ee the object to be of proper
<PB N="60" REF="61">
magnitude to engage them; they mu&s;t &s;ee the means of compa&s;&s;ing it to be next to certain; the mi&s;chiefs not to counterbalance the profit; they will examine how a propo&s;ed impo&s;ition or regulation agrees with the opi|nions of tho&s;e who are likely to be affected by it; they will not de&s;pi&s;e the con&s;ideration even of their habitudes and prejudices. They wi&s;h to know how it accords or di&s;agrees with the true &s;pirit of prior e&s;tabli&s;hments, whether of government or of finance; becau&s;e they well know, that in the complicated oeconomy of great kingdoms, and immen&s;e revenues, which, in a length of time, and by a variety of accidents, have coale&s;ced into a &s;ort of body, an attempt towards a compul&s;ory equality in all circum|&s;tances, and an exact practical definition of the &s;upreme rights in every ca&s;e, is the mo&s;t dangerous and chimerical of all enterprizes. The old building &s;tands well enough, though part Gothic, part Grecian, and part Chine&s;e, until an attempt is made to &s;quare it into uniformity. Then it may come down upon our heads all together in much uniformity of ruin; and great will be the fall thereof. Some people, in&s;tead of inclining to debate the matter, only feel a &s;ort of nau&s;ea, when they are told, that <Q>protection calls for &s;upply,</Q> and that <Q>all the parts ought to contribute to the &s;upport of the whole.</Q> Strange argument for great and grave deliberation! As if the &s;ame end may not, and mu&s;t not be compa&s;&s;ed according to its circum&s;tances, by a great diver&s;ity of ways. Thus in Great Britain &s;ome of our e&s;tabli&s;hments are apt for the &s;upport of credit. They &s;tand therefore upon a principle of their own, di&s;tinct from, and in &s;ome re&s;pects contrary to, the relation between prince and &s;ubject. It is a new &s;pecies of contract &s;uperinduced upon the old contract of the &s;tate. The idea of power mu&s;t as much as po&s;&s;ible be bani&s;hed from it; for power and credit are things adver&s;e, incompatible, <HI>Non bene conveniunt, nec in una &s;ede morantur.</HI> Such e&s;tabli&s;hments are our great <HI>monied</HI> companies. To tax them would be critical and dangerous, and contradictory to the very purpo&s;e of their in&s;titution; which is credit, and cannot therefore be taxation. But the nation, when it gave up that power, did not give up the advantage; but &s;uppo&s;ed, and with rea&s;on, that government was over|paid in credit for what it &s;eemed to lo&s;e in authority. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, to talk of the rights of &s;overeignty, is quite idle. Other e&s;tabli&s;hments &s;upply other modes of public contribution. Our <HI>trading</HI> companies, as well as individual importers, are a fit &s;ubject of a revenue by cu&s;toms. Some e&s;ta|bli&s;hments pay us by a <HI>monopoly</HI> of their con&s;umption and their produce. This, nominally no tax, in reality comprehends all taxes. Such e&s;tabli&s;h|ments are our colonies. To tax them, would be as erroneous in policy, as rigorous in equity. Ireland &s;upplies us by furni&s;hing troops in war; and by bearing part of our foreign e&s;tabli&s;hment in peace. She aids us at all times by the money that her ab&s;entees &s;pend among&s;t us; which is no &s;mall part
<PB N="61" REF="62">
of the rental of that kingdom. Thus Ireland contributes her part. Some objects bear port duties. Some are fitter for an inland exci&s;e. The mode varies, the object is the &s;ame. To &s;train the&s;e from their old and inveterate leanings might impair the old benefit, and not an&s;wer the end of the new project. Among all the great men of antiquity, <HI>Procru&s;tes</HI> &s;hall never be my hero of legi&s;lation; with his iron bed, the allegory of his government, and the type of &s;ome modern policy, by which the long limb was to be cut &s;hort, and the &s;hort tortured into length. Such was this &s;tate bed of uniformity! He would, I conceive, be a very indif|ferent farmer, who complained that his &s;heep did not plough, or his hor&s;es yield him wool; though it would be an idea full of equality. They may think this right in ru&s;tic oeconomy, who think it available in the politic;</P>

<P>As the author has &s;tated this Indian taxation for no vi&s;ible purpo&s;e rela|tive to his plan of &s;upply; &s;o he has &s;tated many other projects with as little, if any di&s;tinct end; unle&s;s perhaps to &s;hew you how full he is of projects for the public good; and what va&s;t expectations may be formed of him or his friends, if they &s;hould be tran&s;lated into admini&s;|tration. It is always from &s;ome opinion that the&s;e &s;peculations may one day become our public mea&s;ures, that I think it worth while to trouble the reader at all about them.</P>
<P>Two of them &s;tand out in high relievo beyond the re&s;t. The fir&s;t is a change in the internal repre&s;entation of this country, by enlarging our number of con&s;tituents. The &s;econd is an addition to our repre&s;entatives, by new American members of parliament. I pa&s;s over here all con&s;i|derations how far &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem will be an improvement of our con&s;titu|tion according to any &s;ound theory. Not that I mean to condemn &s;uch &s;peculative enquiries concerning this great object of the national attention. They may tend to clear doubtful points, and po&s;&s;ibly may lead, as they have often done, to real improvements. What I object to, is their introduction into a di&s;cour&s;e relating to the immediate &s;tate of our affairs, and recommending plans of practical government, In this view, I &s;ee nothing in them but what is u&s;ual with the author; an attempt to rai&s;e di&s;content in the people of England, to balance tho&s;e di&s;contents the mea&s;ures of his friends had already rai&s;ed in America. What other rea|&s;on can he have for &s;ugge&s;ting, that we are not happy enough to enjoy a &s;ufficient number of voters in England? I believe that mo&s;t &s;ober thinkers on this &s;ubject are rather of opinion, that our fault is on the other &s;ide; and that it would be more in the &s;pirit of our con&s;titution, and more agree|able to the pattern of our be&s;t laws, by le&s;&s;ening the number, to add to the weight and independency of our voters. And truly, con&s;idering the
<PB N="62" REF="63">
immen&s;e and dangerous charge of elections; the pro&s;titute and daring venality, the corruption of manners, the idlene&s;s and profligacy of the lower &s;ort of voters, no prudent man would propo&s;e to encrea&s;e &s;uch an evil, if it be, as I fear it is, out of our power to admini&s;ter to it any remedy. The author propo&s;es nothing further. If he has any improvements that may balance or may le&s;&s;en this inconvenience, he has thought proper to keep them as u&s;ual in his own brea&s;t. Since he has been &s;o re&s;erved, I &s;hould have wi&s;hed he had been as cautious with regard to the project it&s;elf. Fir&s;t, becau&s;e he ob&s;erves ju&s;tly, that his &s;cheme, however it might improve the platform, can add nothing to the authority of the legi&s;lature; much I fear it will have a contrary operation. For, authority depending on opinion at lea&s;t as much as on duty, an idea circulated among the people that our con&s;titution is not &s;o perfect as it ought to be, before you are &s;ure of mending it, is a certain method of le&s;&s;ening it in the public opinion. Of this irreverent opinion of parliament, the author him&s;elf complains in one part of his book; and he endeavours to encrea&s;e it in the other. Has he well con&s;i|dered what an immen&s;e operation any change in our con&s;titution is? how many di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, parties, and pa&s;&s;ions, it will nece&s;&s;arily excite; and when you open it to enquiry in one part, where the enquiry will &s;top? Experience &s;hews us, that no time can be fit for &s;uch changes but a time of general confu&s;ion; when good men, finding every thing already broke up, think it right to take advantage of the opportunity of &s;uch de|rangement in favour of an u&s;eful alteration. Perhaps a time of the greate&s;t &s;ecurity and tranquillity both at home and abroad may likewi&s;e be fit; but will the author affirm this to be ju&s;t &s;uch a time? Transferring an idea of military to civil prudence, he ought to know how dangerous it is to make an alteration of your di&s;po&s;ition in the face of an enemy.</P>
<P>Now comes his American repre&s;entation. Here too, as u&s;ual, he takes no notice of any difficulty, or propo&s;es any &s;ort of &s;olution. He throws you his politics, as he does his revenue; do you make &s;omething of them if you can. Is not the reader a little a&s;toni&s;hed at the propo&s;al of an American repre&s;entation from that quarter? It is propo&s;ed merely as a project of &s;peculative improvement; not from the nece&s;&s;ity in the ca&s;e, not to add any thing to the authority of parliament: but that we may afford a greater attention to the concerns of the Ame|ricans, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="P."> <MILESTONE N="39. 40." UNIT="P."> and give them a better opportunity of &s;tating their grievances, and of obtaining redre&s;s. I am glad to find the author has at length di&s;|covered, that we have not given a &s;ufficient attention to their concerns, or a proper redre&s;s to their grievances. His great friend would once have been exceedingly di&s;plea&s;ed with any per&s;on, who &s;hould tell him, that he did not attend &s;ufficiently to tho&s;e concerns. He thought he did &s;o,
<PB N="63" REF="64">
when he regulated the colonies over and over again: he thought he did &s;o, when he formed two general &s;y&s;tems of revenue; one of port-duties, and the other of internal taxation. The&s;e &s;y&s;tems &s;uppo&s;ed, or ought to &s;uppo&s;e, the greate&s;t attention to, and the mo&s;t detailed information of, all their affairs. However, by contending for the American repre&s;enta|tion, he &s;eems at la&s;t driven virtually to admit, that great caution ought to be u&s;ed in the exerci&s;e of <HI>all</HI> our legi&s;lative rights over an object &s;o remote from our eye, and &s;o little connected with our immediate feelings; that in prudence we ought not to be quite &s;o ready with our taxes, until we can &s;ecure the de&s;ired repre&s;entation in parliament. Perhaps it may be &s;ome time before this hopeful &s;cheme can be brought to perfect ma|turity; although the author &s;eems to be no wi&s;e aware of any ob&s;tructi|ons that lie in the way of it. He talks of his union, ju&s;t as he does of his taxes and his &s;avings, with as much <HI>&s;ang froid</HI> and ea&s;e, as if his wi&s;h and the enjoyment were exactly the &s;ame thing. He appears not to have troubled his head with the infinite difficulty of &s;ettling that repre|&s;entation on a fair balance of wealth and numbers throughout the &s;everal provinces of America and the We&s;t-Indies, under &s;uch an infinite variety of circum&s;tances. It co&s;ts him nothing to fight with nature, and to conquer the order of Providence, which manife&s;tly oppo&s;es it&s;elf to the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch a parliamentary union.</P>
<P>But let us, to indulge his pa&s;&s;ion for projects and power, &s;uppo&s;e the happy time arrived, when the author comes into the mini&s;try, and is to reali&s;e his &s;peculations. The writs are i&s;&s;ued for electing members for America and the We&s;t-Indies. Some provinces receive them in &s;ix weeks, &s;ome in ten, &s;ome in twenty. A ve&s;&s;el may be lo&s;t, and then &s;ome pro|vinces may not receive them at all. But let it be, that they all receive them at once, and in the &s;horte&s;t time. A proper &s;pace mu&s;t be given for proclamation and for the election; &s;ome weeks at lea&s;t. But the mem|bers are cho&s;en, and if &s;hips are ready to &s;ail, in about &s;ix more they arrive in London. In the mean time the parliament has &s;at, and bu&s;ine&s;s far advanced without American repre&s;entatives. Nay, by this time, it may happen, that the parliament is di&s;&s;olved; and then the members &s;hip them|&s;elves again, to be again elected. The writs may arrive in America, before the poor members of a parliament in which they never &s;at, can arrive at their &s;everal provinces. A new intere&s;t is formed, and they find other members are cho&s;en whil&s;t they are on the high &s;eas. But if the writs and members arrive together, here is at be&s;t a new trial of &s;kill among&s;t the candidates, after one &s;et of them have well aired them&s;elves with their two voyages of 6000 miles.</P>
<P>However, in order to facilitate every thing to the author, we will &s;up|po&s;e them all once more elected, and &s;teering again to old England with a good heart, and a fair we&s;terly wind in their &s;tern. On their arrival,
<PB N="64" REF="65">
they find all in a hurry and bu&s;tle; in and out; condolence and congra|tulation; the crown is demi&s;ed. Another parliament is to be called. Away back to America again on a fourth voyage, and to a third election. Does the author mean to make our kings as immortal in their per&s;onal as in their politick character? Or, whil&s;t he bountifully adds to their life, will he take from them their prerogative of di&s;&s;olving parliaments, in fa|vour of the American union? Or are the American repre&s;entatives to be perpetual, and to feel neither demi&s;es of the crown, nor di&s;&s;olutions of parliament?</P>
<P>But the&s;e things may be granted to him without bringing him much nearer to his point. What does he think of re-election? is the American member the only one who is not to take a place, or the only one to be exempted from the ceremony of re-election? How will this great politician pre&s;erve the rights of electors, the fairne&s;s of returns, and the privilege of the hou&s;e of commons, as the &s;ole judge of &s;uch conte&s;ts? It would un|doubtedly be a glorious &s;ight to have eight or ten petitions or double returns, from Bo&s;ton and Barbadoes, from Philadelphia and Jamaica, the members returned, and the petitioners with all their train of attornies, &s;olicitors, mayors, &s;elect-men, provo&s;t mar&s;hals, and about five hundred or a thou&s;and witne&s;&s;es, come to the bar of the hou&s;e of commons-Po&s;&s;ibly we might be interrupted in the enjoyment of this plea&s;ing &s;pecta|cle, if a war &s;hould break out, and our con&s;titutional fleet, loaded with members of parliament, returning officers, petitioners, and witne&s;&s;es, the electors and elected, &s;hould become a prize to the French, or Spani|ards, and be conveyed to Carthagena, or to La vera Cruz, and from thence perhaps to Mexico or Lima, there to remain until a cartel for members of parliament can be &s;ettled, or until the war is ended.</P>
<P>In truth, the author has little &s;tudied this bu&s;ine&s;s, or he might have known, that &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable provinces of America, &s;uch for in&s;tance as Connecticut and Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Bay, have not in each of them, two men who can afford, at a di&s;tance from their e&s;tates, to &s;pend a thou&s;and pounds a year. How can the&s;e provinces be repre&s;ented at We&s;tmin&s;ter? If their province pays them, they are American agents, with &s;alaries, and not independent members of parliament. It is true, that formerly in England members had &s;alaries from their con&s;tituents; but they all had &s;alaries, and were all, in this way, upon a par. If the&s;e American repre&s;entatives have no &s;alaries, then they mu&s;t add to the li&s;t of our pen&s;ioners and dependants at court, or they mu&s;t &s;tarve. There is no alternative.</P>
<P>Enough of this vi&s;ionary union; in which much extravagance appears without any fancy, and the judgement is &s;hocked without any thing to refre&s;h the imagination. It looks as if the author had dropped down from
<PB N="65" REF="66">
the moon, without any knowledge of the general nature of this globe, of the general nature of its inhabitants, without the lea&s;t acquaintance with the affairs of this country. Governor Pownal has handled the &s;ame &s;ubject. To do him ju&s;tice, he treats it upon far more rational principles of &s;peculation; and much more like a man of bu&s;ine&s;s. He thinks (erroneou&s;ly, I conceive) but he does think, that our legi&s;lative rights are incomplete without &s;uch a repre&s;entation. It is no wonder therefore, that he endeavours by every means to obtain it. Not like our author, who is always on velvet, he is aware of &s;ome difficulties; and he propo&s;es &s;ome &s;olutions. But nature is too hard for both the&s;e authors; and America is, and ever will be, without actual repre&s;entation in the hou&s;e of commons: nor will any mini&s;ter be wild enough even to pro|po&s;e &s;uch a repre&s;entation in parliament; however he may choo&s;e to throw out that project, together with others equally far from his real opinions, and remote from his de&s;igns, merely to fall in with the different views, and captivate the affections, of different &s;orts of men.</P>
<P>Whether the&s;e projects ari&s;e from the author's real political principles, or are only brought out in &s;ub&s;ervience to his political views, they compo&s;e the whole of any thing that is like preci&s;e and definite, which the author has given us to expect from that admini&s;tration which is &s;o much the &s;ubject of his prai&s;es and prayers. As to his general propo&s;itions, that <Q>there is a deal of difference between impo&s;&s;ibilities and great difficul|ties;</Q> <Q>that a great &s;cheme cannot be carried unle&s;s made the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive admini&s;trations;</Q> that <Q>virtuous and able men are the fitte&s;t to &s;erve their country;</Q> all this I look on no more than &s;o much rubble to fill up the &s;paces between the regular ma&s;onry. Pretty much in the &s;ame light, I cannot forbear con&s;idering his detached ob&s;ervations on commerce; &s;uch as, that <Q>the &s;y&s;tem for colony regulations would be very &s;imple, and mu|tually beneficial to Great Britain and her colonies, if the old navigation <MILESTONE N="39" UNIT="P."> laws were adhered to.</Q> That <Q>the tran&s;portation &s;hould be in all ca&s;es in &s;hips belonging to Briti&s;h &s;ubjects.</Q> That <Q>even Briti&s;h &s;hips &s;hould not be <HI>generally</HI> received into the colonies from any part of Europe, except the dominions of Great Britain.</Q>&mdash;That <Q>it is unrea&s;onable that corn and &s;uch like products &s;hould be re&s;trained to come fir&s;t to a Briti&s;h port.</Q> What do all the&s;e fine ob&s;ervations &s;ignify? &s;ome of them condemn as ill prac|tices, things that never were practi&s;ed at all. Some recommend to be done, things that always have been done. Others indeed convey, though obliquely and loo&s;ely, &s;ome in&s;inuations highly dangerous to our commerce. If I could prevail on my&s;elf to think the author meant to ground any practice upon the&s;e general propo&s;itions, I &s;hould think it very nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;k a few que&s;tions about &s;ome of them. For in&s;tance, what does he mean by talking of an adherence to the old navigation laws? Does he mean,
<PB N="66" REF="67">
that the particular law, 12 Car. II, c. 19, commonly called the act of navigation, is to be adhered to, and that the &s;everal &s;ub&s;equent additions, amendments, and exceptions, ought to be all repealed? If &s;o, he will make a &s;trange havock in the whole &s;y&s;tem of our trade laws, which have been univer&s;ally acknowledged to be full as well founded in the alterations and exceptions, as the act of Charles the Second, in the original provi&s;ions; and to pur&s;ue full as wi&s;ely, the great end of that very politic law, the encrea&s;e of the Briti&s;h navigation. I fancy the writer could hardly propo&s;e any thing more alarming to tho&s;e immediately intere&s;ted in that navi|gation than &s;uch a repeal. If he does not mean this, he has got no farther than a nugatory propo&s;ition, which nobody can contradict, and for which no man is the wi&s;er.</P>
<P>That <Q>the regulations for the colony trade would be few and &s;imple if the old navigation laws were adhered to,</Q> I utterly deny as a fact. That they ought to be &s;o, &s;ounds well enough; but this propo&s;ition is of the &s;ame nugatory nature with &s;ome of the former. The regulations for the co|lony trade ought not to be more nor fewer, nor more or le&s;s complex, than the occa&s;ion requires. And, as that trade is in a great mea&s;ure a &s;y&s;tem of art and re&s;triction, they can be neither few nor &s;imple. It is true, that the very principle may be de&s;troyed by multiplying to exce&s;s the means of &s;ecuring it. Never did a mini&s;ter depart more from the author's ideas of &s;impli|city, or more embarra&s;s the trade of America with the multiplicity and intricacy of regulations and ordinances, than his boa&s;ted mini&s;ter of 1764. That mini&s;ter &s;eemed to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with &s;omething, hardly &s;hort of a rage, for regulation and re&s;triction. He had &s;o multiplied bonds, certificates, affidavits, warrants, &s;ufferances, and cockets; had &s;upported them with &s;uch &s;evere penalties, and extended them without the lea&s;t con|&s;ideration of circum&s;tances to &s;o many objects, that, had they all continu|ed in their original force, commerce mu&s;t &s;peedily have expired under them. Some of them, the mini&s;try which gave them birth, was obliged to de&s;troy: with their own hand they &s;igned the condemnation of their own regulations; confe&s;&s;ing in &s;o many words, in the preamble of their act of the 5th Geo. III. that &s;ome of the&s;e regulations had laid <HI>an un|nece&s;&s;ary re&s;traint on the trade and corre&s;pondence of his Maje&s;ty's American &s;ubjects.</HI> This, in that mini&s;try, was a candid confe&s;&s;ion of a mi&s;take; but every alteration made in tho&s;e regulations by their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, is to be the effect of envy, and American mi&s;repre&s;entation. So much for the author's &s;implicity in regulation.</P>
<P>I have now gone through all which I think immediately e&s;&s;ential in the author's ideas of war, of peace, of the comparative &s;tates of England and France, of our actual &s;ituation; of his projects of oeconomy, of finance, of commerce, and of con&s;titutional improvement. There remains nothing
<PB N="67" REF="68">
now to be con&s;idered, except his heavy cen&s;ures upon the admini&s;tration which was formed in 1765; which is commonly known by the name of the Marquis of Rockingham's admini&s;tration, as the admini&s;tration which pre|ceded it is by that of Mr. Grenville. The&s;e cen&s;ures relate chiefly to three heads: 1. To the repeal of the American &s;tamp act. 2. To the com|mercial regulations then made. 3. To the cour&s;e of foreign negotiations during that &s;hort period.</P>
<P>A per&s;on who knew nothing of public affairs but from the writings of this author, would be led to conclude, that, at the time of the change in June 1765, &s;ome well-dige&s;ted &s;y&s;tem of admini&s;tration, founded in national &s;trength, and in the affections of the people, proceeding in all points with the mo&s;t reverential and tender regard to the laws, and pur|&s;uing with equal wi&s;dom and &s;ucce&s;s every thing which could tend to the internal pro&s;perity, and to the external honour and dignity of this country, had been all at once &s;ubverted by an irruption of a &s;ort of wild, licentious, unprincipled invaders, who wantonly, and with a barbarous rage, had defaced a thou&s;and fair monuments of the con&s;titutional and po|litical &s;kill of their predece&s;&s;ors. It is natural indeed that this author &s;hould have &s;ome di&s;like to the admini&s;tration which was formed in 1765. Its views in mo&s;t things were different from tho&s;e of his friends; in &s;ome, altogether oppo&s;ite to them. It is impo&s;&s;ible that both of the&s;e admini|&s;trations &s;hould be the objects of public e&s;teem. Their different princi|ples compo&s;e &s;ome of the &s;tronge&s;t political lines which di&s;criminate the parties even now &s;ub&s;i&s;ting among&s;t us. The mini&s;ters of 1764 are not indeed followed by very many in their oppo&s;ition; yet a large part of the people now in office entertain, or pretend to entertain, &s;entiments en|tirely conformable to theirs; whil&s;t &s;ome of the former collegues of the mini&s;try which was formed in 1765, however they may have abandoned the connexion, and contradicted by their conduct the principles of their for|mer friends, pretend, on their parts, &s;till to adhere to the &s;ame maxims. All the le&s;&s;er divi&s;ions, which are indeed rather names of per&s;onal attach|ment than of party di&s;tinction, fall in with the one or the other of the&s;e leading parties.</P>
<P>I intend to &s;tate as &s;hortly as I am able, the general condition of public affairs, and the di&s;po&s;ition of the minds of men, at the time of the remark|able change of &s;y&s;tem in 1765. The reader will have thereby a more di&s;tinct view of the comparative merits of the&s;e &s;everal plans, and will re|ceive more &s;atisfaction concerning the ground and rea&s;on of the mea&s;ures which were then pur&s;ued, than, I believe, can be derived from the peru&s;al of tho&s;e partial repre&s;entations contained in the State of the Nation, and the other writings of tho&s;e who have continued, for now near three years,
<PB N="68" REF="69">
in the undi&s;turbed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pre&s;s. This will, I hope, be &s;ome apology for my dwelling a little on this part of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>On the re&s;ignation of the Earl of Bute, in 1763, our affairs had been delivered into the hands of three mini&s;ters of his recommendation; Mr. Grenville, the Earl of Egremont, and the Earl of Halifax. This arrange|ment, notwith&s;tanding the retirement of Lord Bute, announced to the publick a continuance of the &s;ame mea&s;ures; nor was there more rea&s;on to expect a change from the death of the Earl of Egremont. The Earl of Sandwich &s;upplied his place. The Duke of Bedford, and the gentlemen who act in that connexion, and who&s;e general character and politics were &s;ufficiently under&s;tood, added to the &s;trength of the mini&s;try, without making any alteration in their plan of conduct. Such was the con&s;titu|tion of the mini&s;try which was changed in 1765.</P>
<P>As to their politics, the principles of the peace of Paris governed in fo|reign affairs. In dome&s;tic, the &s;ame &s;cheme prevailed, of contradicting the opinions, and di&s;gracing mo&s;t of the per&s;ons, who had been countenanced and employed in the late reign. The inclinations of the people were little attended to; and a di&s;po&s;ition to the u&s;e of forcible methods ran through the whole tenour of admini&s;tration. The nation in general was unea&s;y and di&s;&s;atisfied. Sober men &s;aw cau&s;es for it in the con&s;titu|tion of the mini&s;try, and the conduct of the mini&s;ters. The mini&s;ters, who have u&s;ually a &s;hort method on &s;uch occa&s;ions, attributed their unpopularity wholly to the efforts of faction. However this might be, the licentiou&s;ne&s;s and tumults of the common people, and the con|tempt of government, of which our author &s;o often and &s;o bitterly com|plains, as owing to the mi&s;management of the &s;ub&s;equent admini&s;trations, had at no time ri&s;en to a greater or a more dangerous height. The mea&s;ures taken to &s;uppre&s;s that &s;pirit, were as violent and licentious as the &s;pirit it&s;elf; injudicious, precipitate, and &s;ome of them illegal. In|&s;tead of allaying, they tended infinitely to inflame the di&s;temper; and who|ever will be at the lea&s;t pains to examine, will find tho&s;e mea&s;ures, not only the cau&s;es of the tumults which then prevailed, but the real &s;ources of almo&s;t all the di&s;orders which have ari&s;en &s;ince that time: more in|tent on making a victim to party, than an example of ju&s;tice, they blun|dered in the method of pur&s;uing their vengeance. By this means a di&s;|covery was made of many practices, common indeed in the office of &s;ecre|tary of &s;tate, but wholly repugnant to our laws, and the genius of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution. One of the wor&s;t of the&s;e was, the wanton and indi&s;criminate &s;eizure of papers, even in ca&s;es where the &s;afety of the &s;tate was not pretended in ju&s;tification of &s;o har&s;h a proceeding. The temper of the mini&s;try had excited a jealou&s;y, which made the people more than commonly vigilant, concerning every power which was exerci&s;ed by
<PB N="69" REF="70">
government. The abu&s;e, however &s;anctioned by cu&s;tom, was evident; but the mini&s;try, in&s;tead of re&s;ting in a prudent inactivity, or (what would have been &s;till more prudent) taking the lead, in quieting the minds of the people, and a&s;certaining the law upon tho&s;e delicate points, made u&s;e of the whole influence of government to prevent a parliamentary re&s;o|lution again&s;t the practices of office. And le&s;t the colourable rea&s;ons, of|fered in argument again&s;t this parliamentary procedure, &s;hould be mi&s;|taken for the real motives of their conduct, all the advantage of privilege, all the arts and fine&s;&s;es of pleading, and great &s;ums of public money, were lavi&s;hed, to prevent any deci&s;ion upon tho&s;e practices in the courts of ju&s;tice. In the mean time, in order to weaken, &s;ince they could not immediately de&s;troy, the liberty of the pre&s;s, the privilege of parliament was voted away in all accu&s;ations for a &s;editious libel. The freedom of debate in parliament it&s;elf was no le&s;s menaced. Officers of the army, of long and meritorious &s;ervice, and of &s;mall fortunes, were cho&s;en as victims for a &s;ingle vote; by an exertion of mini&s;terial power, which had been very rarely u&s;ed, and which is extremely unju&s;t, as depriving men not only of a place, but a profe&s;&s;ion, and is indeed of the mo&s;t per|nicious example both in a civil and a military light.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t all things were managed at home with &s;uch a &s;pirit of di&s;order|ly de&s;poti&s;m; abroad there was a proportionable abatement of all &s;pirit. Some of our mo&s;t ju&s;t and valuable claims were in a manner abandoned. This indeed &s;eemed not very incon&s;i&s;tent conduct in the mini&s;ters who had made the treaty of Paris. With regard to our dome&s;tic affairs, there was no want of indu&s;try; but there was a great deficiency of temper, and judgment, and manly comprehen&s;ion of the public intere&s;t. The nation certainly wanted relief, and government attempted to admini&s;ter it. Two ways were principally cho&s;en for this great purpo&s;e. The fir&s;t by regu|lation; the &s;econd by new funds of revenue. Agreeably to this plan, a new naval e&s;tabli&s;hment was formed at a good deal of expence, and to little effect, to aid in the collection of the cu&s;toms. Regulation was added to regulation; and the &s;tricte&s;t and mo&s;t unre&s;erved orders were given, for a prevention of all contraband trade here, and in every part of Ameri|ca. A teazing cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, and a multiplicity of perplexing regulations, ever have, and ever will appear, the ma&s;ter-piece of finance to people of narrow views; as a paper again&s;t &s;muggling, and the importation of French finery, never fails of furni&s;hing a very popular column in a news-paper.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of the&s;e regulations were made for America; and they fell &s;o indi&s;criminately on all &s;orts of contraband, or &s;uppo&s;ed contraband, that &s;ome of the mo&s;t valuable branches of trade were driven violently from our ports; which cau&s;ed an univer&s;al con&s;ternation throughout the
<PB N="70" REF="71">
colonies. Every part of the trade was infinitely di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by them. Men of war now for the fir&s;t time, armed with regular commi&s;&s;ions of cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers, inve&s;ted the coa&s;ts, and gave to the collection of reve|nue the air of ho&s;tile contribution. About the &s;ame time that the&s;e regula|tions &s;eemed to threaten the de&s;truction of the only trade from whence the plantations derived any &s;pecie, an act was made, putting a &s;top to the future emi&s;&s;ion of paper currency, which u&s;ed to &s;upply its place among them. Hand in hand with this went another act for obliging the colonies to pro|vide quarters for &s;oldiers. In&s;tantly followed another law, for levying throughout all America new port duties, upon a va&s;t variety of commodi|ties of their con&s;umption, and &s;ome of which lay heavy upon objects nece&s;|&s;ary for their trade and fi&s;hery. Immediately upon heels of the&s;e, and amid&s;t the unea&s;ine&s;s and confu&s;ion produced by a crowd of new impo|&s;itions and regulations, &s;ome good, &s;ome evil, &s;ome doubtful, all crude and ill-con&s;idered, came another act, for impo&s;ing an univer&s;al &s;tamp-duty on the colonies; and this was declared to be little more than an experiment, and a foundation of future revenue. To render the&s;e proceedings the more irritating to the colonies, the principal argument u&s;ed in favour of their ability to pay &s;uch duties, was the liberality of the grants of their a&s;|&s;emblies during the late war. Never could any argument be more in|&s;ulting and mortifying to a people habituated to the granting of their own money.</P>
<P>Taxes for the purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing revenue had hitherto been &s;paringly attempted in America. Without ever doubting the extent of its lawful power, parliament always doubted the propriety of &s;uch impo&s;itions. And the Americans on their part never thought of conte&s;ting a right by which they were &s;o little affected. Their a&s;&s;emblies in the main an&s;wered all the purpo&s;es nece&s;&s;ary to the internal oeconomy of a free people, and provided for all the exigences of government which aro&s;e among&s;t them|&s;elves. In the mid&s;t of that happy enjoyment, they never thought of cri|tically &s;ettling the exact limits of a power which was nece&s;&s;ary to their union, their &s;afety, their equality, and even their liberty. Thus the two very difficult points, &s;uperiority in the pre&s;iding &s;tate, and freedom in the &s;ubordinate, were on the whole &s;ufficiently, that is, practically, reconciled; without agitating tho&s;e vexatious que&s;tions, which in truth, rather belong to metaphy&s;icks than politicks, and which can never be moved without &s;haking the foundations of the be&s;t governments that have ever been con&s;tituted by human wi&s;dom. By this mea&s;ure was let loo&s;e that dangerous &s;pirit of di&s;qui&s;ition, not in the coolne&s;s of philo|&s;ophical enquiry, but enflamed with all the pa&s;&s;ions of an haughty re&s;entful people, who thought them&s;elves deeply injured, and that they were con|tending for every thing that was valuable in the world.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="72">
In England, our mini&s;ters went on without the lea&s;t attention to the&s;e alarming di&s;po&s;itions; ju&s;t as if they were doing the mo&s;t common things, in the mo&s;t u&s;ual way, and among a people not only pa&s;&s;ive, but plea&s;ed. They took no one &s;tep to divert the dangerous &s;pirit, which began even then to appear in the colonies, to compromi&s;e with it, to mollify it, or to &s;ubdue it. No new arrangements were made in civil govern|ment; no new powers or in&s;tructions were given to governors; no augmentation was made, or new di&s;po&s;ition, of forces. Never was &s;o critical a mea&s;ure pur&s;ued with &s;o little provi&s;ion again&s;t its nece&s;&s;ary con|&s;equences. As if all common prudence had abandoned the mini&s;ters, and as if they meant to plunge them&s;elves and us headlong into that gulph which &s;tood gaping before them, by giving a year's notice of the project of their &s;tamp act, they allowed time for all the di&s;contents of that country to fe&s;ter and come to a head, and for all the arrangements which factious men could make towards an oppo&s;ition to the law. At the &s;ame time they carefully concealed from the eye of parliament, tho&s;e remon&s;trances which they had actually received; and which in the &s;tronge&s;t manner indicated the di&s;content of &s;ome of the colonies, and the con&s;equences which might be expected; they concealed them, even in defiance of an order of council, that they &s;hould be laid before parliament. Thus, by concealing the true &s;tate of the ca&s;e, they ren|dered the wi&s;dom of the nation as improvident as their own temerity, either in preventing or guarding again&s;t the mi&s;chief. It has indeed, from the beginning to this hour, been the uniform policy of this &s;et of men, in order at any hazard to obtain a pre&s;ent credit, to propo&s;e what|ever might be plea&s;ing, as attended with no difficulty; and afterwards to throw all the di&s;appointment of the wild expectations they had rai&s;ed, upon tho&s;e who have the hard ta&s;k of freeing the publick from the con&s;e|quences of their pernicious projects.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the commerce, and tranquillity, of the whole empire were &s;ha|ken in this manner, our affairs grew &s;till more di&s;tracted by the internal di&s;&s;entions of our mini&s;ters. Treachery and ingratitude was charged from one &s;ide; de&s;poti&s;m and tyranny from the other; the vertigo of the regency bill; the awkward reception of the &s;ilk bill in the hou&s;e of com|mons, and the incon&s;iderate and abrupt rejection of it in the hou&s;e of lords; the &s;trange and violent tumults which aro&s;e in con&s;equence, and which were rendered more &s;erious, by being charged by the mini&s;ters upon one another; the report of a gro&s;s and brutal treatment of the&mdash;, by a mini&s;try at the &s;ame time odious to the people; all con&s;pired to leave the publick, at the clo&s;e of the &s;e&s;&s;ion of 1765, in as critical and perilous a &s;ituation, as ever the nation was, or could be, in a time when &s;he was not immediately threatened by her neighbours.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="73">
It was at this time, and in the&s;e circum&s;tances, that a new admini&s;tra|tion was formed. Profe&s;&s;ing even indu&s;triou&s;ly, in this public matter, to avoid anecdotes; I &s;ay nothing of tho&s;e famous reconciliations and quar|rels, which weakened the body that &s;hould have been the natural &s;upport of this admini&s;tration. I run no ri&s;que in affirming, that, &s;urrounded as they were with difficulties of every &s;pecies, nothing but the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t uncorrupt &s;en&s;e of their duty to the publick could have prevailed upon &s;ome of the per&s;ons who compo&s;ed it to undertake the king's bu&s;ine&s;s at &s;uch a time. Their preceding character, their mea&s;ures while in power, and the &s;ub&s;equent conduct of many of them, I think, leave no room to charge this a&s;&s;ertion to flattery. Having undertaken the commonwealth, what remained for them to do? to piece their conduct upon the broken chain of former mea&s;ures? If they had been &s;o inclined, the ruinous nature of tho&s;e mea&s;ures which began in&s;tantly to appear, would not have per|mitted it. Scarcely had they entered into office, when letters arrived from all parts of America, making loud complaints backed by &s;trong rea|&s;ons, again&s;t &s;everal of the principal regulations of the late mini&s;try, as threatening de&s;truction to many valuable branches of commerce. The&s;e were attended with repre&s;entations from many merchants, and ca|pital manufacturers at home, who had all their intere&s;ts involved in the &s;upport of lawful trade, and in the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of every &s;ort of contraband. Whil&s;t the&s;e things were under con&s;ideration, that conflagration blazed out at once in North America, an univer&s;al di&s;obedience, and open re&s;i&s;t|ance to the &s;tamp act; and, in con&s;equence, an univer&s;al &s;top to the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, and to trade and navigation, throughout that great im|portant country; an interval during which the trading intere&s;t of England lay under the mo&s;t dreadful anxiety which it ever felt.</P>
<P>The repeal of that act was propo&s;ed. It was much too &s;erious a mea|&s;ure, and attended with too many difficulties upon every &s;ide, for the then mini&s;try to have undertaken it, as &s;ome paltry writers have a&s;&s;erted, from envy and di&s;like to their predece&s;&s;ors in office. As little could it be owing to per&s;onal cowardice, and dread of con&s;equences to them&s;elves. Mini|&s;ters, timorous from their attachment to place and power, will fear more from the con&s;equences of one court intrigue, than from a thou&s;and diffi|culties to the commerce and credit of their country, by di&s;turbances at three thou&s;and miles di&s;tance. From which of the&s;e the mini&s;ters had mo&s;t to apprehend at that time, is known, I pre&s;ume, univer&s;ally. Nor did they take that re&s;olution from a want of the fulle&s;t &s;en&s;e of the incon|veniencies which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily attend a mea&s;ure of conce&s;&s;ion from the &s;overeign to the &s;ubject. That it mu&s;t encrea&s;e the in&s;olence of the mu|tinous &s;pirits in America, was but too obvious. No great mea&s;ure indeed, at a very difficult cri&s;is, can be pur&s;ued, which is not attended with &s;ome
<PB N="73" REF="74">
mi&s;chief; none but conceited pretenders in public bu&s;ine&s;s will hold any other language; and none but weak and unexperienced men will believe them, if they &s;hould. If we were found in &s;uch a cri&s;is, let tho&s;e who&s;e bold de&s;igns, and who&s;e defective arrangements, brought us into it, an&s;wer for the con&s;equences. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the then mini&s;try evidently was, to take &s;uch &s;teps, not as the wi&s;hes of our author, or as their own wi&s;hes dictated, but as the bad &s;ituation in which their predece&s;&s;ors had left them ab&s;olutely required.</P>
<P>The di&s;obedience to this act was univer&s;al throughout America; no|thing, it was evident, but the &s;ending a very &s;trong military, backed by a very &s;trong naval force, would reduce the &s;editious to obedience. To &s;end it to one town, would not be &s;ufficient; every province of America mu&s;t be traver&s;ed, and mu&s;t be &s;ubdued. I do not entertain the lea&s;t doubt but this could be done. We might, I think, without much difficulty have de|&s;troyed our colonies. This de&s;truction might be effected, probably in a year, or in two at the utmo&s;t. If the que&s;tion was upon a foreign nation, where every &s;ucce&s;sful &s;troke adds to your own power, and takes from that of a rival, a ju&s;t war with &s;uch a certain &s;uperiority would be undoubtedly an ad|vi&s;eable mea&s;ure. But <HI>four million</HI> of debt due to our merchants, the to|tal ce&s;&s;ation of a trade annually worth <HI>four million</HI> more, a large foreign traffick, much home manufacture, a very capital immediate revenue ari|&s;ing from colony imports, indeed the produce of every one of our reve|nues greatly depending on this trade, all the&s;e were very weighty accu|mulated con&s;iderations, at lea&s;t well to be weighed, before that &s;word was drawn, which even by its victories mu&s;t produce all the evil effects of the greate&s;t national defeat. How public credit mu&s;t have &s;uffered, I need not &s;ay. If the condition of the nation, at the clo&s;e of our foreign war, was what this author repre&s;ents it, &s;uch a civil war would have been a bad couch on which to repo&s;e our wearied virtue. Far from being able to have entered into new plans of oeconomy, we mu&s;t have launched into a new &s;ea, I fear a boundle&s;s &s;ea, of expence. Such an addition of debt, with &s;uch a diminution of revenue and trade, would have left us in no want of a <HI>State of the Nation</HI> to aggravate the picture of our di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Our trade felt this to its vitals: and our then mini&s;ters were not a&s;hamed to &s;ay, that they &s;ympathi&s;ed with the feelings of our merchants. The univer&s;al alarm of the whole trading body of England will never be laughed at by them as an ill-grounded or a pretended panick. The uni|ver&s;al de&s;ire of that body will always have great weight with them in every con&s;ideration connected with commerce; neither ought the opinion of that body to be &s;lighted (notwith&s;tanding the contemptuous and inde|cent language of this author, and his a&s;&s;ociates), in any con&s;ideration what&s;oever, of revenue. Nothing among&s;t us is more quickly or deeply
<PB N="74" REF="75">
affected by taxes of any kind, than trade; and if an American tax was a real relief to England, no part of the community would be &s;ooner, or more materially, relieved by it than our merchants. But they well know that the trade of England mu&s;t be more burthened by one penny rai&s;ed in America, than by three in England; and if that penny be rai&s;ed with the unea&s;ine&s;s, the di&s;content, and the confu&s;ion of America, more than by ten.</P>
<P>If the opinion and wi&s;h of the landed intere&s;t is a motive, and it is a fair and ju&s;t one, for taking away a real and a large revenue, the de&s;ire of the trading intere&s;t of England ought to be a ju&s;t ground for taking away a tax, of little better than &s;peculation, which was to be collected by a war, which was to be kept up with the perpetual di&s;content of tho&s;e who were to be affected by it, and the value of who&s;e produce, even after the <HI>ordi|nary</HI> charges of collection, was very uncertain <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">It is ob&s;ervable, that the partizans of American taxation, when they have a mind to repre|&s;ent this tax as wonderfully beneficial to England, &s;tate it as worth &pound;. 100.000 a year; when they are to repre&s;ent it as very light on the Americans, it dwindles to &pound;. 60000. Indeed it is very difficult to compute what its produce might have been.</NOTE>; after the <HI>extraordinary,</HI> the deare&s;t purcha&s;ed revenue that ever was made by any nation.</P>
<P>The&s;e were &s;ome of the motives drawn from principles of convenience for that repeal. When the object came to be more narrowly in&s;pected, every motive concurred. The&s;e colonies were evidently founded in &s;ub|&s;ervience to the commerce of Great Britain. From this principle, the whole &s;y&s;tem of our laws concerning them became a &s;y&s;tem of re&s;triction. A double monopoly was e&s;tabli&s;hed on the part of the parent country; 1. a monopoly of their whole import, which is to be altogether from Great Britain; 2. a monopoly of all their export, which is to be no where but to Great Britain, as far as it can &s;erve any purpo&s;e here. On the &s;ame idea it was contrived that they &s;hould &s;end all their products to us raw, and in their fir&s;t &s;tate; and that they &s;hould take every thing from us in the la&s;t &s;tage of manufacture.</P>
<P>Were ever a people under &s;uch circum&s;tances, that is, a people who were to export raw, and to receive manufactured, and this, not a few lux|urious articles, but all articles, even to tho&s;e of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t, mo&s;t vulgar, and nece&s;&s;ary con&s;umption, a people who were in the hands of a general monopo|li&s;t, were ever &s;uch a people &s;u&s;pected of a po&s;&s;ibility of becoming a ju&s;t object of revenue? All the ends of their foundation mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed ut|terly contradicted before they could become &s;uch an object. Every trade|law we have made mu&s;t have been eluded, and become u&s;ele&s;s, before they could be in &s;uch a condition.</P>
<P>The partizans of the new &s;y&s;tem, who, on mo&s;t occa&s;ions, take credit for full as much knowledge as they po&s;&s;e&s;s, think proper on this occa&s;ion

to counterfeit an extraordinary degree of ignorance, and in con&s;equence of it to a&s;&s;ert <Q>that the balance (between the colonies and Great Britain), <NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;id. p. 74.</NOTE> is unknown, and that no important conclu&s;ion can be drawn from pre|mi&s;es &s;o very uncertain.</Q> Now to what can this ignorance be owing? were the navigation laws made, that this balance &s;hould be unknown? is it from the cour&s;e of exchange that it is unknown, which all the world knows to be greatly and perpetually again&s;t the colonies? is it from the doubtful nature of the trade we carry on with the colonies? are not the&s;e &s;chemi&s;ts well apprized, that the coloni&s;ts, particularly tho&s;e of the nor|thern provinces, import more from Great Britain, ten times more, than they &s;end in return to us? That a great part of their foreign balance is, and mu&s;t be, remitted to London? I &s;hall be ready to admit that the colonies ought to be taxed to the revenues of this country, when I know that they are out of debt to its commerce. This author will furni&s;h &s;ome ground to his theories, and communicate a di&s;covery to the publick, if he can &s;hew this, by any medium. But he tells us, <Q>that their &s;eas are covered <NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;id. p. 79.</NOTE> with &s;hips, and their rivers floating with commerce.</Q> This is &s;till true. But it is with <HI>our</HI> &s;hips that they are covered; and they float with Briti&s;h commerce. The American merchants are our factors; all in reality, mo&s;t even in name. They trade, they navigate, they cultivate with Engli&s;h capitals; to their own advantage, to be &s;ure; for without the&s;e capitals their ploughs would be &s;topped, and their &s;hips wind|bound. But he who employs the capital mu&s;t, on the whole, be the per|&s;on principally benefited; the per&s;on who works upon it, profits on his part too; but he profits in a &s;ubordinate way, as our colonies do; that is, as the &s;ervant of a wi&s;e and indulgent ma&s;ter, and no otherwi&s;e. We have all, except the <HI>peculium,</HI> without which even &s;laves will not labour.</P>
<P>If the author's principles, which are the common notions, be right, that the price of our manufactures is &s;o greatly enhanced by our taxes; then the Americans already pay in that way a &s;hare of our impo&s;itions. He is not a&s;hamed to a&s;&s;ert, <Q>that France and China may be &s;aid, on the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;id. p. 74.</NOTE> &s;ame principle, to bear a part of our charges, for they con&s;ume our com|modities.</Q> Was ever &s;uch a method of rea&s;oning heard of? Do not the laws ab&s;olutely confine the colonies to buy from us, whether foreign nations &s;ell cheaper or not? On what other idea are all our prohibitions, regulations, guards, penalties, and forfeitures, framed? To &s;ecure to us, not a commercial preference, which &s;tands in need of no penalties to enforce it; it finds its own way; but to &s;ecure to us a trade, which is a creature of law and in&s;titution. What has this to do with the principles of a foreign trade, which is under no monopoly, and in which we cannot rai&s;e the price of our goods, without hazarding the demand for them? None but the au|thors of &s;uch mea&s;ures could ever think of making u&s;e of &s;uch arguments.</P>

Whoever goes about to rea&s;on on any part of the policy of this country with regard to America, upon the mere ab&s;tract principles of government, or even upon tho&s;e of our own antient con&s;titution, will be often mi&s;led. Tho&s;e who re&s;ort for arguments to the mo&s;t re&s;pectable autho|rities, antient or modern, or re&s;t upon the cleare&s;t maxims, drawn from the experience of other &s;tates and empires, will be liable to the greate&s;t errors imaginable. The object is wholly new in the world. It is &s;ingular: it is grown up to this magnitude and importance within the memory of man; nothing in hi&s;tory is parallel to it. All the rea&s;onings about it, that are likely to be at all &s;olid, mu&s;t be drawn from its actual circum|&s;tances. In this new &s;y&s;tem, a principle of commerce, of artificial com|merce, mu&s;t predominate. This commerce mu&s;t be &s;ecured by a multi|tude of re&s;traints very alien from the &s;pirit of liberty; and a powerful authority mu&s;t re&s;ide in the principal &s;tate, in order to enforce them. But the people who are to be the objects of the&s;e re&s;traints are de&s;cendants of Engli&s;hmen; and of an high and free &s;pirit. To hold over them a government made up of nothing but re&s;traints, and penalties, and taxes in the granting of which they can have no &s;hare, will neither be wi&s;e, nor long practicable. People mu&s;t be governed in a manner agreeable to their temper and di&s;po&s;ition; and men of free character and &s;pirit mu&s;t be ruled with, at lea&s;t, &s;ome conde&s;cen&s;ion to this &s;pirit and this character. The Briti&s;h coloni&s;t mu&s;t &s;ee &s;omething which will di&s;tingui&s;h him from the co|loni&s;ts of other nations. Tho&s;e rea&s;onings, which infer from the many re&s;traints under which we have already laid America, to our right to lay it under &s;till more, and indeed under all manner of re&s;traints, are con|clu&s;ive; conclu&s;ive as to right; but the very rever&s;e as to policy and practice. We ought rather to infer from our having laid the colonies under many re&s;traints, that it is rea&s;onable to compen&s;ate them by every indulgence that can by any means be reconciled to our intere&s;t. We have a great empire to rule, compo&s;ed of a va&s;t ma&s;s of heterogeneous governments, all more or le&s;s free and popular in their forms, all to be kept in peace, and kept out of con&s;piracy, with one another, all to be held in &s;ubordination to this country; while the &s;pirit of an exten&s;ive and intricate trading intere&s;t pervades the whole, always qualifying, and often controlling, every general idea of con&s;titution and government. It is a great and difficult object; and I wi&s;h we may po&s;&s;e&s;s wi&s;dom and temper enough to govern it as we ought. Its importance is infinite. I believe the reader will be &s;truck, as I have been, with one &s;ingular fact. In the year 1704, but &s;ixty-five years ago, the whole trade with our plantations was but a few thou&s;and pounds more in the export article, and a third le&s;s in the import, than that which we now carry on with the &s;ingle i&s;land of Jamaica:

<P>From the &s;ame information I find that our dealing with mo&s;t of the European nations is but little encrea&s;ed; the&s;e nations have been pretty much at a &s;tand &s;ince that time; and we have rivals in their trade. This colony intercour&s;e is a new world of commerce in a manner created; it &s;tands upon principles of its own; principles hardly worth endangering for any little con&s;ideration of extorted revenue.</P>
<P>The reader &s;ees, that I do not enter &s;o fully into this matter, as obvi|ou&s;ly I might. I have already been led into greater lengths than I intended. It is enough to &s;ay, that, before the mini&s;ters of 1765 had determined to propo&s;e the repeal of the &s;tamp act in parliament, they had the whole of the American con&s;titution and commerce very fully before them. They con&s;idered maturely; they decided with wi&s;dom: let me add, with firmne&s;s. For they re&s;olved, as a preliminary to that repeal, to a&s;&s;ert in the fulle&s;t and lea&s;t equivocal terms the unlimited legi&s;lative right of this country over its colonies; and, having done this, to propo&s;e the repeal, on principles, not of con&s;titutional right, but on tho&s;e of ex|pediency, of equity, of lenity, and of the true intere&s;ts pre&s;ent and future of that great object, for which alone the colonies were founded, naviga|tion and commerce. This plan, I &s;ay, required an uncommon degree of firmne&s;s; when we con&s;ider that &s;ome of tho&s;e per&s;ons who might be of the greate&s;t u&s;e in promoting the repeal, violently with&s;tood the declaratory act; and they who agreed with admini&s;tration in the principles of that law, equally made, as well the rea&s;ons on which the declaratory act it&s;elf &s;tood, as tho&s;e on which it was oppo&s;ed, grounds for an oppo&s;ition to the repeal.</P>
<P>If the then mini&s;try re&s;olved fir&s;t to declare the right, it was not from any opinion they entertained of its future u&s;e in regular taxation. Their opinions were full and declared again&s;t the ordinary u&s;e of &s;uch a power. But it was plain, that the general rea&s;onings which were employed again&s;t that power, went directly to our whole legi&s;lative right; and one part of it could not be yielded to &s;uch arguments, without a virtual &s;urrender of all the re&s;t. Be&s;ides, if that very &s;pecific power of levying money in the colonies were not retained as a &s;acred tru&s;t in the hands of Great Britain (to be u&s;ed, not in the fir&s;t in&s;tance for &s;upply, but in the la&s;t exigence for controul) it is obvious, that the pre&s;iding authority of Great Britain, as the head, the arbiter and director of the whole empire, would vani&s;h into an empty name, without operation or energy. With the habitual exerci&s;e of &s;uch a power in the ordinary cour&s;e of &s;upply, no
<PB N="78" REF="79">
trace of freedom could remain to America <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">I do not here enter into the un&s;atisfactory di&s;qui&s;ition concerning repre&s;entation real or pre&s;umed. I only &s;ay, that a great people, who have their property, without any re&s;erve, in all ca&s;es, di&s;po&s;ed of by another people at an immen&s;e di&s;tance from them, will not think them&s;elves in the enjoyment of freedom. It will be hard to &s;hew to tho&s;e who are in &s;uch a &s;tate, which of the u&s;ual parts of the definition or de&s;cription of a free people are appli|cable to them; and it is neither plea&s;ant nor wi&s;e to attempt to prove that they have no right to be comprehended in &s;uch a de&s;cription.</NOTE>. If Great Britain were &s;tripped of this right, every principle of unity and &s;ubordination in the empire was gone for ever. Whether all this can be reconciled in legal &s;peculation, is a matter of no con&s;equence. It is reconciled in policy; and politics ought to be adju&s;ted, not to human rea&s;onings, but to human nature; of which the rea&s;on is but a part; and by no means the greate&s;t part.</P>
<P>Founding the repeal on this ba&s;is, it was judged proper to lay before parliament the whole detail of the American affairs, as fully as it had been laid before the mini&s;try them&s;elves. Ignorance of tho&s;e affairs had mi&s;led parliament. Knowledge alone could bring it into the right road. Every paper of office was laid upon the table of the two hou&s;es; every denomination of men, either of America, or connected with it by office, by re&s;idence, by commerce, by intere&s;t, even by injury; men of civil and military capacity, officers of the revenue, merchants, ma|nufacturers of every &s;pecies, and from every town in England, attended at the bar. Such evidence never was laid before parliament. If an emulation aro&s;e among the mini&s;ters, and members of parliament, as the author rightly ob&s;erves, for the repeal of this act, as well as for the other regulations, it was not on the confident a&s;&s;ertions, the airy &s;peculations, <MILESTONE N="21" UNIT="P."> or the vain promi&s;es of mini&s;ters, that it aro&s;e. It was the &s;en&s;e of parliament on the evidence before them. No one &s;o much as &s;u&s;pects, that mini&s;terial allurements or terrors had any &s;hare in it.</P>
<P>Our author is very much di&s;plea&s;ed, that &s;o much credit was given to the te&s;timony of merchants. He has an habit of railing at them; and he may, if he plea&s;es, indulge him&s;elf in it. It will not do great mi&s;chief to that re&s;pectable &s;et of men. The &s;ub&s;tance of their te&s;timony was, that their debts in America were very great: That the Americans declined to pay them, or to renew their orders, whil&s;t this act continued: That, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, they de&s;paired of the recovery of their debts, or the renewal of their trade in that country: That they appre|hended a general failure of mercantile credit. The manufacturers depo&s;ed to the &s;ame general purpo&s;e, with this addition, that many of them had di&s;charged &s;everal of their artificers; and, if the law, and the re&s;i&s;tance to it &s;hould continue, mu&s;t di&s;mi&s;s them all.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="80">
This te&s;timony is treated with great contempt by our author. It mu&s;t be, I &s;uppo&s;e, becau&s;e it was contradicted by the plain nature of things. Suppo&s;e then, that the merchants had, to gratify this author, given a contrary evidence; and had depo&s;ed, that while America remained in a &s;tate of re&s;i&s;t|ance, whil&s;t four million of debt remained unpaid, whil&s;t the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice was &s;u&s;pended for want of &s;tamped paper, &s;o that no debt could be recovered, whil&s;t there was a total &s;top to trade, becau&s;e every &s;hip was &s;ub|ject to &s;eizure for want of &s;tamped clearances, and while the colonies were to be declared in rebellion, and &s;ubdued by armed force, that in the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances they would &s;till continue to trade chearfully and fearle&s;sly as before; would not &s;uch witne&s;&s;es provoke univer&s;al indignation for their folly or their wickedne&s;s, and be de&s;ervedly hooted from the bar <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Here the author has a note altogether in his u&s;ual &s;train of rea&s;oning; he finds out that &s;ome|body, in the cour&s;e of this multifarious evidence, had &s;aid, <Q>that a very con&s;iderable part of the orders of 1765 tran&s;mitted from America had been afterwards &s;u&s;pended; but that, in ca&s;e the &s;tamp act was repealed, tho&s;e orders were to be executed in the pre&s;ent year 1766;</Q> and that, on the repeal of the &s;tamp act, <Q>the exports to the colonies would be at lea&s;t double the value of the exports of the pa&s;t year.</Q> He then triumphs exceedingly on their having fallen &s;hort of it, on the &s;tate of the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e entries. I do not know well what con|clu&s;ion he draws applicable to his purpo&s;e, from the&s;e facts. He does not deny that all the orders which came from America &s;ub&s;equent to the di&s;turbances of the &s;tamp act were on the condition of that act being repealed; and he does not a&s;&s;ert that, notwith&s;tanding that act &s;hould be enforced by a &s;trong hand, &s;till the orders would be executed. Neither does he quite venture to &s;ay that this decline of the trade in 1766 was owing to the repeal. What does he therefore infer from it, favourable to the enforcement of that law? It only comes to this, and no more; tho&s;e merchants, who thought our trade would be doubled in the &s;ub&s;e|quent year, were mi&s;taken in their &s;peculations. So that the &s;tamp act was not to be repealed unle&s;s this &s;peculation of theirs was a probable event. But it was not repealed in order to double our trade in that year, as every body knows (whatever &s;ome merchants might have &s;aid), but le&s;t in that year we &s;hould have no trade at all. The fact is, that, during the greate&s;t part of the year 1765, that is, until about the month of October, when the accounts of the di&s;turbances came thick upon us, the American trade went on as u&s;ual. Before this time the &s;tamp act could not affect it. Afterwards, the merchants fell into a great con&s;ternation; a general &s;tagnation in trade en&s;ued. But as &s;oon as it was known that the mini&s;try favoured the repeal of the &s;tamp act, &s;everal of the bolder merchants ventured to execute their orders; others more timid hung back; in this manner the trade continued in a &s;tate of dreadful fluctuation beween the fears of tho&s;e who had ventured, for the event of their boldne&s;s, and the anxiety of tho&s;e who&s;e trade was &s;u&s;pended, until the royal a&s;&s;ent was finally given to the bill of repeal. That the trade of 1766 was not equal to that of 1765, could not be owing to the repeal; it aro&s;e from quite different cau&s;es, of which the author &s;eems not to be aware: 1&s;t, Our conque&s;ts during the war had laid open the trade of the French and Spani&s;h We&s;t Indies to North America much more largely than &s;he had ever enjoyed it; this continued for &s;ome time after the peace; but at length it was extremely contracted, and in &s;ome places reduced to nothing. Such in particular was the &s;tate of Jamaica. On the taking the Havannah, all their &s;tores were emptied into that place, which produced unu&s;ual orders for goods, for &s;upplying their own con&s;umption, as well as for further &s;peculations of trade. The&s;e cea&s;ing, the trade &s;tood on its own bottom. This is one cau&s;e of the dimini&s;hed</NOTE>? would
<PB N="80" REF="81">
any human faith have given credit to &s;uch a&s;&s;ertions? The te&s;timony of the merchants was nece&s;&s;ary for the detail, and to bring the matter home to the feeling of the hou&s;e; as to the general rea&s;ons, they &s;poke abun|dantly for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e principles was the act repealed, and it produced all the good effect which was expected from it: quiet was re&s;tored; trade generally returned to its antient channels; time and means were furni&s;hed for the better &s;trengthening of government there, as well as for recovering, by judicious mea&s;ures, the affections of the people, had that mini&s;try continued, or had a mini&s;try &s;ucceeded with di&s;po&s;itions to improve that opportunity.</P>
<P>Such an admini&s;tration did not &s;ucceed. In&s;tead of profiting of that &s;ea&s;on of tranquillity, in the very next year they cho&s;e to return to mea|&s;ures of the very &s;ame nature with tho&s;e which had been &s;o &s;olemnly con|demned; though upon a &s;maller &s;cale. The effects have been cor|re&s;pondent. America is again in di&s;order; not indeed in the &s;ame degree as formerly, nor any thing like it. Such good effects have attended the repeal of the &s;tamp act, that the colonies have actually paid the taxes; and they have &s;ought their redre&s;s (upon however improper principles), not in their own violence, as formerly <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">The di&s;turbances have been in Bo&s;ton only; and were not in con&s;equence of the late duties.</NOTE>; but in the experienced benignity of parliament. They are not ea&s;y indeed, nor ever will be &s;o, under this author's &s;chemes of taxation; but we &s;ee no longer the &s;ame general fury and confu&s;ion, which attended their re&s;i&s;tance to the &s;tamp act. The author may rail at the repeal, and tho&s;e who propo&s;ed it, as he plea&s;es. Tho&s;e hone&s;t men &s;uffer all his obloquy with plea&s;ure, in the mid&s;t of the quiet which they have been the means of giving to their country; and would think his prai&s;es for their per&s;everance in a pernicious &s;cheme, a very bad compen|&s;ation for the di&s;turbance of our peace, and the ruin of our commerce. Whether the return to the &s;y&s;tem of 1764, for rai&s;ing a revenue in America, the di&s;contents which have en&s;ued in con&s;equence of it, the general &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the a&s;&s;emblies in con&s;equence of the&s;e di&s;contents,
<PB N="81" REF="82">
the u&s;e of the military power, and the new and dangerous commi&s;&s;ions which now hang over them, will produce equally good effects, is greatly to be doubted. Never, I fear, will this nation and the colonies fall back upon their true centre of gravity, and natural point of repo&s;e, until the ideas of 1766 are re&s;umed, and &s;teadily pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>As to the regulations, a great &s;ubject of the author's accu&s;ation, they are of two &s;orts; one of a mixed nature; of revenue and trade; the other &s;imply relative to trade. With regard to the former I &s;hall ob&s;erve, that, in all deliberations concerning America, the ideas of that admini&s;tration were principally the&s;e; to take trade as the primary object, and revenue but as a very &s;ubordinate con&s;ideration; where the trade was likely to &s;uffer, they did not he&s;itate for an in&s;tant to prefer it to taxes, who&s;e produce at be&s;t was contemptible, in compari&s;on of the object which they might endanger. The other of their principles was, to &s;uit the revenue to the object. Where the difficulty of collection, from the nature of the country, and of the revenue e&s;tabli&s;hment, is &s;o very notorious, it was their policy to hold out as few temptations to &s;muggling as po&s;&s;ible, by keeping the duties as nearly as they could on a balance with the ri&s;que. On the&s;e principles, they made many alterations in the port duties of 1764, both in the mode, and in the quantity. The author has not attempted to prove them erroneous. He complains enough to &s;hew that he is in an ill hu|mour, not that his adver&s;aries have done ami&s;s.</P>
<P>As to the regulations which were merely relative to commerce, many were then made; and they were all made upon this principle; that many of the colonies, and tho&s;e &s;ome of the mo&s;t abounding in people, were &s;o &s;ituated as to have very few means of traffick with this country. It became therefore our object to let them into as much foreign trade as could be given them without interfering with our own; and to &s;ecure by every method the returns to the mother country. Without &s;ome &s;uch &s;cheme of enlargement, it was obvious, that any benefit we could expect from the&s;e colonies mu&s;t be extremely limited. Accordingly many facilities were given to their trade with the foreign plantations, and with the Southern parts of Europe. As to the confining the returns to this country, admini&s;tration &s;aw the mi&s;|chief and folly of a plan of indi&s;criminate re&s;traint. They applied their remedy to that part where the di&s;ea&s;e exi&s;ted, and to that only; on this idea they e&s;tabli&s;hed regulations, far more likely to check the danger|ous clande&s;tine trade with Hamburgh and Holland, than this author's friends, or any of their predece&s;&s;ors, had ever done.</P>
<P>The friends of the author have a method &s;urely a little whim&s;i|cal in all this &s;ort of di&s;cu&s;&s;ions. They have made an innumerable multitude of commercial regulations, at which the trade of England exclaimed with one voice, and many of which have been altered on the
<PB N="82" REF="83">
unanimous opinion of that trade. Still they go on, ju&s;t as before, in a &s;ort of droning panegyric on them&s;elves, talking of the&s;e regulations as prodigies of wi&s;dom; and, in&s;tead of appealing to tho&s;e who are mo&s;t affected and the be&s;t judges, they turn round in a perpetual circle of their own rea&s;onings and pretences; they hand you over from one of their own pamphlets to another; "&s;ee," &s;ay they, <Q>this demon&s;trated in The Regulations of the Colonies.</Q> <Q>See this &s;atisfactorily proved in The Con&s;iderations.</Q> By and by we &s;hall have another; <Q>&s;ee for this The State of the Nation.</Q> I wi&s;h to take another method in vin|dicating the oppo&s;ite &s;y&s;tem. I refer to the petitions of merchants for the&s;e regulations; to their thanks when they were obtained; and to the &s;trong and grateful &s;en&s;e they have ever &s;ince expre&s;&s;ed of the benefits received under that admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>All admini&s;trations have in their commercial regulations been generally aided by the opinion of &s;ome merchants; too frequently by that of a few, and tho&s;e a &s;ort of favourites: they have been directed by the opinion of one or two merchants, who were to merit in flatteries, and to be paid in contracts; who frequently advi&s;ed, not for the general good of trade, but for their pri|vate advantage. During the admini&s;tration of which this author complains, the meeting of merchants upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of trade were numerous and public; &s;ometimes at the hou&s;e of the Marquis of Rockingham, &s;ometimes at Mr. Dowde&s;well's; &s;ometimes at Sir George Savile's, an hou&s;e always open to every deliberation favourable to the liberty or the commerce of his country. Nor were the&s;e meetings confined to the merchants of London. Merchants and manufacturers were invited from all the con&s;iderable towns of England. They conferred with the mini&s;ters and active members of parlia|ment. No private views, no local intere&s;ts prevailed. Never were points in trade &s;ettled upon a larger &s;cale of information. They who attended the&s;e meetings well know, what mini&s;ters they were who heard the mo&s;t pa|tiently, who comprehended the mo&s;t clearly, and who provided the mo&s;t wi&s;ely. Let then this author and his friends &s;till continue in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the practice of exalting their own abilities in their pamphlets, and in the news-papers. They never will per&s;uade the publick, that the merchants of England were in a general confederacy to &s;acrifice their own intere&s;ts to tho&s;e of North America, and to de&s;troy the vent of their own goods in favour of the manufactures of France and Holland.</P>
<P>Had the friends of this author taken the&s;e means of information, his extreme terrors of contraband in the We&s;t India I&s;lands would have been greatly quieted, and his objections to the opening of the ports would have cea&s;ed. He would have learned, from the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory analy&s;is of the We&s;t India trade, that we have the advantage in every e&s;&s;ential article of it; and, that almo&s;t every re&s;triction on our communication with our neigh|bours there, is a re&s;triction unfavourable to our&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="84">
Such were the principles that guided, and the authority which &s;anctioned, the&s;e regulations. No man ever &s;aid, that, in the multiplicity of regu|lations made in the admini&s;tration of their predece&s;&s;ors, none were u&s;e|ful: &s;ome certainly were &s;o; and I defy the author to &s;hew a commercial regulation of that period, which he can prove, from any authority except his own, to have a tendency beneficial to commerce, that has been repealed. So far were that mini&s;try from being guided by a &s;pirit of contradiction or of innovation.</P>
<P>The author's attack on that admini&s;tration, for their neglect of our claims on foreign powers, is by much the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing in&s;tance he has given, or that, I believe, any man ever did give, of an intrepid effrontery. It relates to the Manilla ran&s;om; to the Canada bills; and to the Ru&s;&s;ian treaty. Could one imagine, that the&s;e very things, which he thus choo&s;es to object to others, have been the principal &s;ubjects of charge again&s;t his favourite mini&s;try; in&s;tead of clearing them of the&s;e charges, he appears not &s;o much as to have heard of them, but throws them directly upon the admini&s;tration which &s;ucceeded to that of his friends.</P>
<P>It is not always very plea&s;ant to be obliged to produce the detail of this kind of tran&s;actions to the public view. I will content my&s;elf therefore with giving a &s;hort &s;tate of facts, which, when the author choo&s;es to contradict, he &s;hall &s;ee proved, more, perhaps, to his conviction, than to his liking. The fir&s;t fact then is, that the demand for the Manilla ran&s;om had been, in the author's favourite admini&s;tration, &s;o neglected, as to appear to have been little le&s;s than tacitly abandoned. At home, no countenance was given to the claimants; and when it was mentioned in parliament, the then leader did not &s;eem, at lea&s;t, <HI>a very &s;anguine advocate in favour of the claim.</HI> The&s;e things made it a matter of no &s;mall difficulty to re&s;ume and pre&s;s that negotiation with Spain. However, &s;o clear was our right, that the then mini&s;ters re&s;olved to revive it; and &s;o little time was lo&s;t, that, though that admini&s;tra|tion was not compleated until the ninth of July, 1765; on the 20th of the following Augu&s;t, General Conway tran&s;mitted a &s;trong and full remon&s;trance on that &s;ubject, to the Earl of Rochfort. The argument, on which the court of Madrid mo&s;t relied, was the dereliction of that claim by the preceding mini&s;ters. However, it was &s;till pu&s;hed with &s;o much vi|gour, that the Spaniards, from a po&s;itive denial to pay, offered to refer the demand to arbitration. That propo&s;ition was rejected; and the demand being &s;till pre&s;&s;ed, there was all the rea&s;on in the world to expect its being brought to a favourable i&s;&s;ue; when it was thought proper to change the admini&s;tration. Whether, under their circum&s;tances, and in the time they continued in power, more could be done, the reader will judge; who will hear with a&s;toni&s;hment a charge of remi&s;&s;ne&s;s from tho&s;e very men,
<PB N="84" REF="85">
who&s;e inactivity, to call it by no wor&s;e a name, laid the chief difficulties in the way of the revived negotiation.</P>
<P>As to the Canada bills, this author thinks proper to a&s;&s;ert, <Q>that the <MILESTONE N="24" UNIT="P."> proprietors found them&s;elves under a nece&s;&s;ity of compounding their demands upon the French court, and accepting terms which they had often rejected; and which the Earl of Halifax had declared he would &s;ooner forfeit his hand than &s;ign.</Q> When I know that the Earl of Halifax &s;ays this, the Earl of Halifax &s;hall have an an&s;wer; but I per&s;uade my&s;elf that his Lord&s;hip has given no authority for this ridiculous rant. In the mean time, I &s;hall only &s;peak of it as a common concern of that mini&s;try.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place then I ob&s;erve, that a convention, for the liquida|tion of the Canada bills, was concluded under the admini&s;tration of 1766; when nothing was concluded under that of the favourites of this author.</P>
<P N="2">2. This tran&s;action was, in every &s;tep of it, carried on in concert with the per&s;ons intere&s;ted, and was terminated to their entire &s;atisfaction. They would have acquie&s;ced perhaps in terms &s;omewhat lower than tho&s;e which were obtained. The author is indeed too kind to them. He will, however, let them &s;peak for them&s;elves, and &s;hew what their own opinion was of the mea&s;ures pur&s;ued in their favour <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>They are happy in having &s;ound, in your zeal for the dignity of this nation, the means of liquidating their claims, and of concluding with the court of France, a convention for the final &s;atisfaction of their demands; and have given us commi&s;&s;ion, in their names, and on their behalf, mo&s;t earne&s;tly to entreat your acceptance of their grateful acknowledg|ments.&mdash;Whether they con&s;ider them&s;elves as Britons, or as men more particularly profit|ing by your generous and &s;pirited interpo&s;ition; they &s;ee great rea&s;ons to be thankful, for having been &s;upported by a mini&s;ter, in who&s;e public affections, in who&s;e wi&s;dom and ac|tivity, both the national honour, and the intere&s;ts of individuals, have been at once &s;o well &s;upported and &s;ecured.</Q> Thanks of the Canada merchants to General Conway, London, April 28, 1766.</P></NOTE>.

<P>The author's la&s;t charge on that mini&s;try, with regard to foreign affairs, is the Ru&s;&s;ian treaty of commerce, which the author thinks fit to a&s;&s;ert, was concluded <Q>on terms the Earl of Buckingham&s;hire had refu&s;ed to <MILESTONE N="23" UNIT="P."> accept of, and which had been deemed by former mini&s;ters di&s;advanta|geous to the nation, and by the merchants un&s;afe and unprofitable.</Q></P>
<P>Both the a&s;&s;ertions in this paragraph are equally groundle&s;s. The treaty then concluded by Sir George Macartney, was not on the terms which the Earl of Buckingham&s;hire had refu&s;ed. The Earl of Buckingham&s;hire never did refu&s;e terms, becau&s;e the bu&s;ine&s;s never came to the point of refu&s;al, or acceptance; all that he did was, to receive the Ru&s;&s;ian project for a treaty of commerce, and to tran&s;mit it to England. This was in November 1764; and he left Peter&s;burgh the January following, before he could even receive an an&s;wer from his own court. The conclu&s;ion of the treaty fell to his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. Whoever will be at the trouble to compare it with the treaty of 1734, will, I believe, confe&s;s, that, if the former mini&s;ters could have ob|tained &s;uch terms, they were criminal in not accepting them.</P>
<P>But the merchants <Q>deemed them un&s;afe and unprofitable.</Q> What mer|chants? As no treaty ever was more maturely con&s;idered, &s;o the opinion of the Ru&s;&s;ian merchants in London was all along taken; and all the in&s;truc|tions &s;ent over were in exact conformity to that opinion. Our mini&s;ter there made no &s;tep without having previou&s;ly con&s;ulted our merchants re&s;ident in Peter&s;burgh, who, before the &s;igning the treaty, gave the mo&s;t full and unanimous te&s;timony in its favour. In their addre&s;s to our mini&s;ter at that court, among other things, they &s;ay, <Q>It may afford &s;ome additio|nal &s;atisfaction to your excellency, to receive a public acknowledgment of <HI>the entire and unre&s;erved approbation of every article</HI> in this treaty, from us who are &s;o immediately and &s;o nearly concerned in its con|&s;equences.</Q> This was &s;igned by the con&s;ul general, and every Briti&s;h merchant in Peter&s;burgh.</P>
<P>The approbation of tho&s;e immediately concerned in the con&s;equences is nothing to this author. He and his friends have &s;o much tenderne&s;s for people's intere&s;ts, and under&s;tand them &s;o much better than they do them&s;elves, that, whil&s;t the&s;e politicians are contending for the be&s;t of po&s;&s;ible terms, the claimants are obliged to go without any terms at all.</P>
<P>One of the fir&s;t and ju&s;te&s;t complaints again&s;t the admini&s;tration of the author's friends, was the want of vigour in their foreign negotiations. Their immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors endeavoured to correct that error, along
<PB N="86" REF="87">
with others; and there was &s;carcely a foreign court, in which the new &s;pirit that had ari&s;en was not &s;en&s;ibly felt, acknowledged, and &s;ome|times complained of. On their coming into admini&s;tration, they found the demolition of Dunkirk entirely at a &s;tand: in&s;tead of demolition, they found con&s;truction; for the French were then at work on the repair of the jettees. On the remon&s;trances of General Conway, &s;ome parts of the&s;e jettees were immediately de&s;troyed. The Duke of Richmond per&s;onally &s;urveyed the place, and obtained a fuller knowledge of its true &s;tate and con|dition than any of our mini&s;ters had done; and, in con&s;equence, had larger offers from the Duke of Choi&s;eul, than had ever been received. But, know|ing the&s;e to be &s;hort of our ju&s;t expectations under the treaty, he rejected them. Our then mini&s;ters, knowing that, in their admini&s;tration, the peoples minds were &s;et at ea&s;e upon all the e&s;&s;ential points of public and private liberty, and that no projects of theirs could endanger the concord of the empire, were under no re&s;traint from pur&s;uing every ju&s;t demand upon foreign nations.</P>
<P>The author, towards the end of this work, falls into reflections upon the &s;tate of public morals in this country: He draws u&s;e from his doctrine, by recommending his friend to the King and the publick, as another Duke of Sully; and he concludes the whole performance with a very devout prayer. The prayers of politicians may &s;ometimes be &s;incere; and as this prayer is in &s;ub&s;tance, that the author, or his friends, may be &s;oon brought into power, I have great rea&s;on to believe it is very much from the heart. However, after he has drawn &s;uch a picture, &s;uch a &s;hocking picture, of the &s;tate of this country, he has great faith in thinking the means he prays for, &s;ufficient to relieve us: after the character he has given of its inhabitants of all ranks and cla&s;&s;es, he has great charity in caring much about them; and indeed, no le&s;s hope, in being of opinion, that &s;uch a dete&s;table nation can ever become the care of Providence. He has not even found five good men in our devoted city.</P>
<P>He talks indeed of men of virtue and ability. But, where are his <HI>men</HI> of virtue and ability to be found? Are they in the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration? never were a &s;et of people more blackened by this author. Are they among the party of tho&s;e (no &s;mall body) who adhere to the &s;y&s;tem of 1766? the&s;e, it is the great purpo&s;e of this book, to calumniate. Are they the per&s;ons who acted with his great friend, &s;ince the change in 1762, to his removal in 1765? &s;carcely any of the&s;e are now out of employment; and we are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his de&s;ideratum. Yet I think he hardly means to &s;elect, even &s;ome of the highe&s;t of them, as examples fit for the re|formation of a corrupt world.</P>
<P>He ob&s;erves, that the virtue of the mo&s;t exemplary prince that ever &s;wayed a &s;cepter <Q>can never warm, or illuminate the body of his people, <MILESTONE N="46" UNIT="P.">

Were ever the favours and emoluments of the &s;tate more lavi&s;hly &s;quan|dered upon per&s;ons &s;candalous in their lives, than during that period? In the&s;e &s;candalous lives, was there any thing more &s;candalous than the mode of puni&s;hing <HI>one culpable individual?</HI> In that individual, is any thing more culpable, than his having been &s;educed by the example of &s;ome of tho&s;e very per&s;ons by whom he was thus per&s;ecuted?</P>
<P>The author is &s;o eager to attack others, that he provides but indif|ferently for his own defence. I believe, without going beyond the page I have now before me, he is very &s;en&s;ible, that I have &s;ufficient matter of further, and, if po&s;&s;ible, of heavier charge, again&s;t his friends, upon his own principles. But it is becau&s;e the advantage is too great, that I decline making u&s;e of it. I wi&s;h the author had not thought, that all methods are lawful in party. Above all, he ought to have taken care not to wound his enemies through the &s;ides of his country. This he has done, by making that mon&s;trous and overcharged picture of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of our &s;ituation. No wonder, that he, who finds this country in the &s;ame condition with that of France at the time of Henry the Fourth, could al&s;o find a re&s;emblance between his political friend and the Duke of Sully. As to tho&s;e per&s;onal re&s;emblances, people will often judge of them from their affections: they may image in the&s;e clouds what&s;oever figures they plea&s;e; but what is the conformation of that eye which can di&s;cover a re&s;emblance of this country and the&s;e times, to tho&s;e with which the author compares them. France, a country ju&s;t recovered out of twenty|five years of the mo&s;t cruel and de&s;olating civil war that perhaps was ever known. The kingdom, under a veil of momentary quiet, full of the mo&s;t atrocious political, operating upon the mo&s;t furious fanatical factions. Some pretenders even to the crown; and tho&s;e who did not pretend to the whole, aimed at the partition of the monarchy. There were almo&s;t as many competitors as provinces; and all abetted by the greate&s;t, the mo&s;t ambitious, and mo&s;t enterprizing power in Europe.

No place &s;afe from trea&s;on; no, not the bo&s;oms on which the mo&s;t ami|able prince that ever lived, repo&s;ed his head; not his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; not even his queen. As to the finances, they had &s;carce an exi&s;tence, but as a matter of plunder to the managers, and of grants to in&s;atiable, and un|grateful courtiers.</P>
<P>How can our author have the heart to de&s;cribe this as any &s;ort of par|allel to our &s;ituation? To be &s;ure, an April &s;hower has &s;ome re&s;emblance to a water &s;pout, for they are both wet; and there is &s;ome likene&s;s be|tween a &s;ummer evening's breeze, and an hurricane; they are both wind: but who can compare our di&s;turbances, our &s;ituation, or our finances, to tho&s;e of France? Great Britain is indeed at this time wearied, but not brok|en, with the efforts of a victorious foreign war; not &s;ufficiently relieved by an inadequate peace; but &s;omewhat benefited by that peace, and infi|nitely by the con&s;equences of that war. The powers of Europe awed by our victories, and lying in ruins upon every &s;ide of us. Burthened indeed we are with debt, but abounding with re&s;ources. We have a trade, not perhaps equal to our wi&s;hes, but more than ever we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. In effect, no pretender to the crown; nor nutriment for &s;uch de&s;perate and de&s;tructive factions as have formerly &s;haken this kingdom.</P>
<P>As to our finances, the author trifles with us. When Sully came to tho&s;e of France, in what order was any part of the financial &s;y&s;tem? or what &s;y&s;tem was there at all? There is no man in office who mu&s;t not be &s;en&s;ible, that ours is, without the act of any parading mini&s;ter, the mo&s;t regular and orderly &s;y&s;tem perhaps that was ever known; the be&s;t &s;e|cured again&s;t all frauds in the collection, and all mi&s;application in the expenditure of public money.</P>
<P>I admit that, in this flouri&s;hing &s;tate of things, there are appearances enough to excite unea&s;ine&s;s and apprehen&s;ion. I admit there is a canker|worm in the ro&s;e:

This is nothing el&s;e than a &s;pirit of di&s;connection, of di&s;tru&s;t, and of trea|chery, among&s;t public men. It is no accidental evil; nor has its effect been tru&s;ted to the u&s;ual frailty of nature: the di&s;temper has been inocu|lated. The author is &s;en&s;ible of it, and we lament it together. This di&s;temper is alone &s;ufficient to take away con&s;iderably from the benefits of our con&s;titution and &s;ituation, and perhaps to render their continuance precarious. If the&s;e evil di&s;po&s;itions &s;hould &s;pread much farther, they mu&s;t end in our de&s;truction; for nothing can &s;ave a people de&s;titute of public and private faith. However, the author, for the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, has extended the charge by much too widely; as men are but too apt to
<PB N="89" REF="90">
take the mea&s;ure of all mankind from their own particular acquaintance. Barren as this age may be in the growth of honour and virtue, the coun|try does not want, at this moment, as &s;trong, and tho&s;e not a few exam|ples, as were ever known, of an un&s;haken adherence to principle, and at|tachment to connexion, again&s;t every allurement of intere&s;t. Tho&s;e examples are not furni&s;hed by the great alone; nor by tho&s;e who&s;e activity in public affairs may render it &s;u&s;pected that they make &s;uch a character one of the rounds in their ladder of ambition; but by men more quiet, and more in the &s;hade, on whom an unmixed &s;en&s;e of honour alone could operate. Such examples indeed are not furni&s;hed in great abundance among&s;t tho&s;e who are the &s;ubjects of the author's panegyrick. He mu&s;t look for them in another camp. He who complains of the ill effects of a divided and heterogeneous admini&s;tration is not ju&s;tifiable in labouring to render odious in the eyes of the publick tho&s;e men, who&s;e principles, who&s;e maxims of policy, and who&s;e per&s;onal character, can alone ad|mini&s;ter a remedy to this capital evil of the age; neither is he con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, in con&s;tantly extolling tho&s;e whom he knows to be the au|thors of the very mi&s;chief of which he complains, and which the whole nation feels &s;o deeply.</P>
<P>The per&s;ons who are the objects of his di&s;like and complaint, are many of them of the fir&s;t families, and weightie&s;t properties, in the kingdom; but infinitely more di&s;tingui&s;hed for their untainted honour public and private, and their zealous but &s;ober attachment to the con&s;titution of their country, than they can be by any birth, or any &s;tation. If they are the friends of any one great man, rather than another, it is not that they make his aggrandi&s;ement the end of their union; or becau&s;e they know him to be the mo&s;t active in caballing for his connexions the large&s;t and &s;peedie&s;t emoluments. It is becau&s;e they know him, by per&s;onal experience, to have wi&s;e and enlarged ideas of the public good, and an invincible con|&s;tancy in adhering to it; becau&s;e they are convinced, by the whole tenour of his conduct, that he will never negotiate away their honour, or his own: and that, in or out of power, change of &s;ituation will make no al|teration in his conduct. This will give to &s;uch a per&s;on, in &s;uch a body, an authority and re&s;pect that no mini&s;ter ever enjoyed among his venal dependants, in the highe&s;t plenitude of his power; &s;uch as &s;ervility never can give, &s;uch as ambition never can receive or reli&s;h.</P>
<P>This body will often be reproached by their adver&s;aries, for want of ability in their political tran&s;actions; they will be ridiculed for mi&s;&s;ing many fa|vourable conjunctures, and not profiting of &s;everal brilliant opportunities of fortune: but they mu&s;t be contented to endure that reproach; for they cannot acquire the reputation of <HI>that kind</HI> of ability, without lo&s;ing all the other reputation they po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="91">
They will be charged too with a dangerous &s;pirit of exclu&s;ion and pro|&s;cription, for being unwilling to mix in &s;chemes of admini&s;tration, which have no bond of union, or principle of confidence. That charge too they mu&s;t &s;uffer with patience. If the rea&s;on of the thing had not &s;poken loudly enough, the mi&s;erable examples of the &s;everal admini&s;trations, con&s;tructed upon the idea of &s;y&s;tematic di&s;cord, would be enough to frighten them from &s;uch mon&s;trous and ruinous conjunctions. It is however fal&s;e, that the idea of an united admini&s;tration carries with it that of a pro&s;cription of any other party. It does indeed imply the nece&s;&s;ity of having the great &s;trong holds of government in well-united hands, in order to fecure the predominance of right and uniform princi|ples; of having the capital offices of deliberation and execution in tho&s;e who can deliberate with mutual confidence, and who will execute what is re&s;olved with firmne&s;s and fidelity. If this &s;y&s;tem cannot be rigorou&s;ly adhered to in practice (and what &s;y&s;tem can be &s;o?) it ought to be the con&s;tant aim of good men to approach as nearly to it as po&s;&s;ible. No &s;y&s;tem of that kind can be formed, which will not leave room fully &s;ufficient for healing coalitions: but no coalition, which, under the &s;pe|cious name of independency, carries in its bo&s;om the unreconciled prin|ciples of the original di&s;cord of parties, ever was, or will be, an healing coalition. Nor will the mind of our Sovereign ever know repo&s;e, his kingdom &s;ettlement, or his bu&s;ine&s;s order, efficiency, or grace with his people, until things are e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the ba&s;is of &s;ome &s;et of men, who are tru&s;ted by the publick, and who can tru&s;t one another.</P>
<P>This comes rather nearer to the mark than the author's de&s;cription of a proper admini&s;tration, under the name of <HI>men of ability and virtue,</HI> which conveys no definite idea at all; nor does it apply &s;pecifically to our grand national di&s;temper. All parties pretend to the&s;e qualities. The pre&s;ent mini&s;try, no favourites of the author, will be ready enough to declare them&s;elves per&s;ons of virtue and ability; and if they choo&s;e a vote for that purpo&s;e, perhaps it would not be quite impo&s;&s;ible for them to procure it. But, if the di&s;ea&s;e be this di&s;tru&s;t and di&s;connection, it is ea&s;y to know who are &s;ound, and who are tainted; who are fit to re&s;tore us to health, who to continue, and to &s;pread the contagion. The pre&s;ent mini&s;try being made up of draughts from all parties in the kingdom, if they &s;hould pro&s;e&s;s any adherence to the connexions they have left, they mu&s;t convict them&s;elves of the bracke&s;t treachery. They therefore choo&s;e rather to re|nounce the principle it&s;elf, and to brand it with the name of pride and faction. This te&s;t with certainty di&s;criminates the opinions of men. The other is a de&s;cription vague and un&s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>As to the unfortunate gentlemen who may at any time compo&s;e that &s;y&s;tem, which, under the plau&s;ible title of an admini&s;tration, &s;ub&s;i&s;ts but

for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of weakne&s;s and confu&s;ion; they fall into different cla&s;&s;es, with different merits. I think the &s;ituation of &s;ome people in that &s;tate, may de&s;erve a certain degree of compa&s;&s;ion; at the &s;ame time that they furni&s;h an example, which, it is to be hoped, by being a &s;evere one, will have its effect, at lea&s;t, on the growing generation; if an original &s;eduction, on plau&s;ible but hollow pretences, into lo&s;s of honour, friend&s;hip, con&s;i&s;tency, &s;ecurity, and repo&s;e, can furni&s;h it. It is po&s;&s;ible to draw, even from the very pro&s;perity of ambition, examples of terror, and motives to compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I believe the in&s;tances are exceedingly rare of mens immediately pa&s;&s;ing over a clear marked line of virtue into declared vice and corruption. There are a &s;ort of middle tints and &s;hades between the two extremes; there is &s;omething uncertain on the confines of the two empires which they fir&s;t pa&s;s through, and which renders the change ea&s;y and imperceptible. There are even a &s;ort of &s;plendid impo&s;itions &s;o well contrived, that, at the very time the path of rectitude is quitted for ever, men &s;eem to be advancing into &s;ome higher and nobler road of public conduct. Not that &s;uch impo&s;itions are &s;trong enough in them&s;elves; but a powerful in|tere&s;t, often concealed from tho&s;e whom it affects, works at the bottom, and &s;ecures the operation. Men are thus debauched away from tho&s;e legitimate connections, which they had formed on a judgement, early perhaps, but &s;ufficiently mature and wholly unbia&s;&s;ed. They do not quit them upon any ground of complaint, for grounds of ju&s;t complaint may exi&s;t, but upon the flattering and mo&s;t dangerous of all principles, that of mending what is well. Gradually they are habituated to other company; and a change in their habitudes &s;oon makes a way for a change in their opinions. Certain per&s;ons are no longer &s;o very fright|ful, when they come to be known and to be &s;erviceable. As to their old friends, the tran&s;ition is ea&s;y; from friend&s;hip to civility; from civility to enmity; few are the &s;teps from dereliction to per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>People not very well grounded in the principles of public morality, find a &s;et of maxims in office ready made for them, which they a&s;&s;ume as naturally and inevitably, as any of the in&s;ignia or in&s;truments of the &s;itu|ation. A certain tone of the &s;olid and practical is immediately acquired. Every former profe&s;&s;ion of public &s;pirit is to be con&s;idered as a debauch of youth, or, at be&s;t, as a vi&s;ionary &s;cheme of unattainable perfection. The very idea of con&s;i&s;tency is exploded. The convenience of the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day is to furni&s;h the principle for doing it. Then the whole mini&s;terial cant is quickly got by heart. The prevalence of faction is to be lamented. All oppo&s;ition is to be regarded as the effect of di&s;content. All admini&s;trations are declared to be alike. The &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity ju&s;tifies all their mea&s;ures. It is no longer a matter of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, who or what
<PB N="92" REF="93">
admini&s;tration is; but admini&s;tration is to be &s;upported as a general maxim. Flattering them&s;elves, that their power is become nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of all order and government; every thing which tends to the &s;upport of that power is &s;anctified, and becomes a part of the public intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Growing every day more formed to affairs, and better knit in their limbs, when the occa&s;ion (now the only rule) requires it, they be|become capable of &s;acrificing tho&s;e very per&s;ons, to whom they had before &s;acrificed their original friends. It is now only in the ordinary cour&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s to alter an opinion, or to betray a connexion. Frequently relin|qui&s;hing one &s;et of men and adopting another, they grow into a total indifference to human feeling, as they had before to moral obligation; until, at length, no one original impre&s;&s;ion remains upon their minds; every principle is obliterated; every &s;entiment effaced.</P>
<P>In the mean time, that power which all the&s;e changes aimed at &s;ecuring, remains &s;till as tottering and as uncertain as ever. They are delivered up into the hands of tho&s;e who feel neither re&s;pect for their per&s;ons, nor gratitude for their favours; who are put about them in appearance to &s;erve, in reali|ty to govern them; and, when the &s;ignal is given, to abandon and de&s;troy them; in order to &s;et up &s;ome newer dupe of ambition, who, in his turn, is to be abandoned and de&s;troyed. Thus living in a &s;tate of con|tinual unea&s;ine&s;s and ferment, &s;oftened only by the mi&s;erable con&s;olation of giving now and then preferments to tho&s;e for whom they have no value; they are unhappy in their &s;ituation, and find it impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;ign it. Until, at length, &s;oured in temper, and di&s;appointed by the very attain|ment of their ends, in &s;ome angry, in &s;ome haughty, or &s;ome negligent moment, they incur the di&s;plea&s;ure of tho&s;e upon whom they have ren|dered their very being dependent. Then <HI>perierunt tempora longi &s;ervitii;</HI> they are ca&s;t off with &s;corn; they are turned out, emptied of all natural character, of all intrin&s;ic worth, of all e&s;&s;ential dignity, and deprived of every con&s;o|lation of friend&s;hip. Having rendered all retreat to old principles ridicu|lous, and to old regards impracticable, not being able to counterfeit plea|&s;ure, or to di&s;charge di&s;content, nothing being &s;incere, or right, or balan|ced in their minds, it is more than a chance, that, in the delirium of the la&s;t &s;tage of their di&s;tempered power, they make an in&s;ane political te&s;ta|ment, by which they throw all their remaining weight and con&s;equence into the &s;cale of their declared enemies, and the avowed authors of their de&s;truction. Thus they fini&s;h their cour&s;e. Had it been po&s;&s;ible that the whole, or even a great part of the&s;e effects on their minds, I &s;ay no|thing of the effect upon their fortunes, could have appeared to them in their fir&s;t departure from the right line, it is certain they would have re|jected every temptation with horror. The principle of the&s;e remarks,
<PB N="93" REF="94">
like every good principle in morality, is trite; but its frequent application is not the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>As to others, who are plain practical men, they have been guiltle&s;s at all times of all public pretence. Neither the author, nor any one el&s;e, has rea|&s;on to be angry with them. They belonged to his friend for their intere&s;t; for their intere&s;t they quitted him; and when it is their intere&s;t, he may depend upon it, they will return to their former connexion. Such peo|ple &s;ub&s;i&s;t at all times, and, though the nu&s;ance of all, are at no time a worthy &s;ubject of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. It is fal&s;e virtue and plau&s;ible error that do the mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>If men come to government with right di&s;po&s;itions, they have not that unfavourable &s;ubject which this author repre&s;ents to work upon. Our cir|cum&s;tances are indeed critical; but then they are the critical circum&s;tan|ces of a &s;trong and mighty nation. If corruption and meanne&s;s are greatly &s;pread, they are not &s;pread univer&s;ally. Many public men are hitherto examples of public &s;pirit, and integrity. Whole parties, as far as large bodies can be uniform, have pre&s;erved character. However they may be deceived in &s;ome particulars, I know of no &s;et of men among&s;t us, which does not contain per&s;ons, on whom the nation, in a difficult exigence, may well value it&s;elf. Private life, which is the nur&s;ery of the commonwealth, is yet in general pure, and on the whole di&s;po&s;ed to virtue; and the people at large want neither genero&s;ity nor &s;pirit. No &s;mall part of that very luxury, which is &s;o much the &s;ubject of the author's declamation, but which, in mo&s;t parts of life, by being well balanced and diffu&s;ed, is only decency and convenience, has perhaps as many, or more, good than evil con&s;equences attending it. It certainly excites indu&s;try, nouri&s;hes emu|lation, and in&s;pires &s;ome &s;en&s;e of per&s;onal value into all ranks of people. What we want is, to e&s;tabli&s;h more fully an opinion of uniformity, and con&s;i&s;tency of character, in the leading men of the &s;tate; &s;uch as will re&s;tore &s;ome confidence to profe&s;&s;ion and appearance, &s;uch as will fix &s;ub|ordination upon e&s;teem. Without this, all &s;chemes are begun at the wrong end. All who join in them are liable to their con&s;equences. All men who, under whatever pretext, take a part in the formation, or the &s;upport of &s;y&s;tems con&s;tructed in &s;uch a manner, as mu&s;t, in their nature, di&s;able them from the execution of their duty, have made them&s;elves guilty of all the pre&s;ent di&s;traction, and of the future ruin, which they may bring upon their country.</P>
<P>It is a &s;erious affair, this &s;tudied di&s;union in government. In ca&s;es where union is mo&s;t con&s;ulted in the con&s;titution of a mini&s;try, and where per&s;ons are be&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to promote it, differences, from the various ideas of men, will ari&s;e; and, from their pa&s;&s;ions, will often ferment into violent heats, &s;o as greatly to di&s;order all public bu&s;ine&s;s. What mu&s;t be
<PB N="94" REF="95">
the con&s;equence, when the very di&s;temper is made the ba&s;is of the con&s;titution; and the original weakne&s;s of human nature is &s;till further enfeebled by art and contrivance? It mu&s;t &s;ubvert government from the very foundation. It turns our public councils into the mo&s;t mi&s;|chievous cabals; where the con&s;ideration is not how the nation's bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hall be carried on, but how tho&s;e who ought to carry it on &s;hall cir|cumvent each other. In &s;uch a &s;tate of things, no order, uniformity, dignity, or effect, can appear in our proceedings either at home or abroad. Nor will it make much difference, whether &s;ome of the con&s;tituent parts of &s;uch an admini&s;tration are men of virtue or ability, or not; &s;uppo&s;ing it po&s;&s;ible that &s;uch men, with their eyes open, &s;hould choo&s;e to make a part in &s;uch a body.</P>
<P>The effects of all human contrivances are in the hand of Providence. I do not like to an&s;wer, as our author &s;o readily does, for the event of any &s;peculation. But &s;ure the nature of our di&s;orders, if any thing, mu&s;t indicate the proper remedy. Men who act &s;teadily on the principles I have &s;tated, may in all events be very &s;erviceable to their country; in one ca&s;e, by furni&s;hing (if their Sovereign &s;hould be &s;o advi&s;ed) an admi|ni&s;tration formed upon ideas very different from tho&s;e which have for &s;ome time been unfortunately fa&s;hionable. But, if this &s;hould not be the ca&s;e, they may be &s;till &s;erviceable; for the example of a large body of men, &s;teadily &s;acrificing ambition to principle, can never be without u&s;e. It will certainly be prolific, and draw others to an imitation. <HI>Vera gloria radices agit, atque etiam propagatur.</HI></P>
<P>I do not think my&s;elf of con&s;equence enough to imitate my author, in troubling the world with the prayers or wi&s;hes I may form for the publick: full as little am I di&s;po&s;ed to imitate his profe&s;&s;ions; tho&s;e pro|fe&s;&s;ions are long &s;ince worn out in the political &s;ervice. If the work will not &s;peak for the author, his own declarations de&s;erve but little credit.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>SO much mi&s;placed indu&s;try has been u&s;ed by the author of The State of the Nation, as well as by other writers, to infu&s;e di&s;content into the People, on account of the late war, and of the effects of our national debt; that nothing ought to be omitted which may tend to di&s;abu&s;e the publick upon the&s;e &s;ubjects. When I had gone through the foregoing &s;heets, I recollected, that, in my pages 39 and 40, I only gave the comparative &s;tates of the duties collected by the exci&s;e at large; together with the quantities of &s;trong beer brewed in the two periods which are there compared. It might be &s;till thought, that &s;ome other articles of popular con&s;umption, of general convenience, and connected with our manufac|tures, might po&s;&s;ibly have declined. I therefore now think it right to lay before the reader the &s;tate of the produce of three capital duties on &s;uch articles; duties which have frequently been made the &s;ubject of popular complaint. The duty on candles; that on &s;oap, paper, &amp;c. and that on hides.</P>

<P>This encrea&s;e has not ari&s;en from any additional duties. None have been impo&s;ed on the&s;e articles during the war. Notwith&s;tanding the burthens of the war, and the late dearne&s;s of provi&s;ions, the con&s;umption of all the&s;e articles has encrea&s;ed, and the revenue along with it.</P>
<P>There is another point in The State of the Nation, to which, I fear, I have not been as full in my an&s;wer as I ought to have been, and as I am well warranted to be. The author has endeavoured to throw a &s;u&s;picion, or &s;omething more, on that &s;alutary, and indeed nece&s;|&s;ary, mea&s;ure of opening the ports in Jamaica. "Orders were given," &s;ays he, <Q>in <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> <MILESTONE N="His note, P. 22."> 1765, for the free admi&s;&s;ion of Spani&s;h ve&s;&s;els into all the colonies.</Q> He then ob&s;erves, that the exports to Jamaica fell &pound;. 40.904 &s;hort of tho&s;e of 1764; and that the exports of the &s;ucceeding year, 1766, fell &s;hort of tho&s;e of 1765, about eighty pounds; from whence he wi&s;ely infers, that, this decline of exports being <HI>&s;ince</HI> the relaxation of the laws of trade,
<PB N="96" REF="97">
there is a ju&s;t ground of &s;u&s;picion, that the colonies have been &s;upplied with foreign commodities in&s;tead of Briti&s;h.</P>
<P>Here, as u&s;ual with him, the author builds on a fact which is ab&s;olutely fal&s;e; and which, being &s;o, renders his whole hypothe&s;is ab&s;urd and impo&s;&s;ible. He a&s;&s;erts, that the order for admitting Spani&s;h ve&s;&s;els was given in <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1765. That order was not <HI>&s;igned at the trea|&s;ury board until the 15th day of the November following;</HI> and therefore &s;o far from affecting the exports of the year 1765: that &s;uppo&s;ing all po&s;&s;ible diligence in the commi&s;&s;ioners of the cu&s;toms in expediting that order, and every advantage of ve&s;&s;els ready to fail, and the mo&s;t favourable wind, it would hardly even arrive in Jamaica within the limits of that year.</P>
<P>This order could therefore by no po&s;&s;ibility be a cau&s;e of the decrea&s;e of exports in 1765. If it had any mi&s;chievous operation, it could not be before 1766. In that year, according to our author, the exports &s;ell &s;hort of the preceding, ju&s;t <HI>eighty</HI> pounds. He is welcome to that diminution; and to all the con&s;equences he can draw from it.</P>
<P>But, as an auxiliary to account for this dreadful lo&s;s, he brings in the Free-port act, which he ob&s;erves (for his convenience) to have been made in &s;pring, 1766; but (for his conveni|ence likewi&s;e) he forgets, that, by the expre&s;s provi&s;ion of the act, the regulation was not to be in force in Jamaica, until the November following. Miraculous mu&s;t be the activity of that contraband who&s;e operation in America could, before the end of that year, have re|acted upon England, and checked the exportation from hence! unle&s;s he choo&s;es to &s;uppo&s;e, that the merchants, at who&s;e &s;olicitation this act had been obtained, were &s;o frighted at the accompli&s;hment of their own mo&s;t earne&s;t and anxious de&s;ire, that, before any good or evil effect from it could happen, they immediately put a &s;top to all further exportation.</P>
<P>It is obvious that we mu&s;t look for the true effect of that act at the time of its fir&s;t po&s;&s;ible operation, that is, in the year 1767. On this idea how &s;tands the account?</P>

<P>This author, for the &s;ake of a pre&s;ent momentary credit, will hazard any future and perma|nent di&s;grace. At the time he wrote, the account of 1767 could not be made up. This was the very fir&s;t year of the trial of the free-port act; and we find that the &s;ale of Briti&s;h commodities is &s;o far from le&s;&s;ened by that act, that the export of 1767 amounts to &pound;. 52.000 more than that of either of the two preceding years, and is &pound;. 11.000 above that of his &s;tandard year 1764. If I could prevail on my&s;elf to argue in favour of a great com|mercial &s;cheme from the appearance of things in a &s;ingle year, I &s;hould from this encrea&s;e of export, infer the beneficial effects of that mea&s;ure. In truth, it is not wanting. Nothing but the thicke&s;t ignorance of the Jamaica trade could have made any one entertain a fancy, that the lea&s;t ill effect on our commerce could follow from this opening of the ports. But, if the author argues the effect of regulations in the American trade from the export of the year in which they are made, or even of the following; why did he not apply this rule to his own? He had the &s;ame paper before him which I have now before me. He mu&s;t have &s;een that in his &s;tandard year (the year 1764), the principal year of his new regulations, the export fell no le&s;s than &pound;. 128.450 &s;hort of that in 1763! Did the export trade revive by the&s;e regulations in 1765, during which year they continued in their full force? It fell about &pound;. 40.000 &s;till lower. Here is a fall of &pound;. 168 000; to account for which, would have become the author much better than piddling for an &pound;. 80 fall in the year 1766 (the only year in which <HI>the order</HI> he objects to could operate), or in pre&s;uming a fall of exports from a regulation which took place only in November 1766; who&s;e effects could not appear until the following year; and which, when they do appear, utterly overthrow all his &s;lim&s;y rea&s;ons and affected &s;u&s;picions upon the effect of opening the ports.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="98">
This author, in the &s;ame paragraph, &s;ays, that <Q>it was a&s;&s;erted by <HI>the American factors and agents,</HI> that the commanders of our &s;hips of war and tenders, having cu&s;tom-hou&s;e com|mi&s;&s;ions, and the &s;trict orders given in 1764 for a due execution of the laws of trade in the colonies, had deterred the Spaniards from trading with us; that the &s;ale of Briti&s;h manu|factures in the We&s;t Indies had been greatly le&s;&s;ened, and the receipt of large &s;ums in &s;pecie prevented.</Q></P>
<P>If the <HI>American factors and agents</HI> a&s;&s;erted this, they had good ground for their a&s;&s;ertion. They knew that the Spani&s;h ve&s;&s;els had been driven from our ports. The author does not po&s;itively deny the fact. If he &s;hould, it will be proved. When the factors con|nected this mea&s;ure and its natural con&s;equences, with an actual fall in the exports to Jamaica, to no le&s;s an amount than &pound;. 128.450 in one year, and with a further fall in the next, is their a&s;&s;ertion very wonderful? The author him&s;elf is full as much alarmed by a fall of only &pound;. 40.000; for, giving him the facts which he chu&s;es to coin, it is no more. The expul&s;ion of the Spani&s;h ve&s;&s;els mu&s;t certainly have been one cau&s;e, if not of the fir&s;t de|clen&s;ion of the exports, yet of their continuance in their reduced &s;tate. Other cau&s;es had their operation, without doubt. In what degree each cau&s;e produced its effect it is hard to determine. But the fact of a fall of exports upon the re&s;training plan, and of a ri&s;e upon the taking place of the enlarging plan, is e&s;tabli&s;hed beyond all contradiction.</P>
<P>This author &s;ays, that the facts relative to the Spani&s;h trade, were a&s;&s;erted by <HI>American factors and agents;</HI> in&s;inuating, that the mini&s;try of 1766 had no better authority for their plan of enlargement than &s;uch a&s;&s;ertions. The moment he choo&s;es it, he &s;hall &s;ee the very &s;ame thing a&s;&s;erted by governours of provinces, by commanders of men of war, and by officers of the cu&s;toms; per&s;ons the mo&s;t bound in duty to prevent contraband, and the mo&s;t intere&s;ted in the &s;eizures to be made in con&s;equence of &s;trict regulation. I &s;uppre&s;s them for the pre&s;ent; wi&s;hing that the author may not drive me to a more full di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this matter than it may be altogether prudent to enter into. I wi&s;h he had not made any of the&s;e di&s;cu&s;&s;ions nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
