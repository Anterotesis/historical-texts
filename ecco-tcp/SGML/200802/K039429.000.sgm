<LG>
<L>YE virgin-train, that whilom wak'd your lyres,</L>
<L>Fa&s;t by the chry&s;tal &s;prings of <HI>Helicon,</HI></L>
<L>To heav'nly &s;trains of joy tho&s;e dulcet Notes</L>
<L>Ill &s;uit a Nation's univer&s;al moan,</L>
<L>When ev'ry hope with their lo&s;t Prince is gone.</L>
<L>The thrilling voice of joy no longer floats</L>
<L>O'er pale <HI>Britannia's</HI> &s;adly-&s;ilent &s;hore;</L>
<L>MARCELLUS is no more!</L>
<L>But oh, the doleful change! the plaintive mu&s;e,</L>
<L>In cypre&s;s crown'd, mu&s;t pour her piteous loan</L>
<L>Of &s;igh, and tear, and heart-empiercing groan!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="3">
<L>Come then, <HI>Melpomene,</HI> begin the Lay,</L>
<L>With rueful Tears your &s;orrowing Dirges &s;teep,</L>
<L>Such tears as er&s;t your &s;i&s;ter-mu&s;e did weep</L>
<L>For her dear twin<HI>-Palici:</HI> every &s;tream</L>
<L>Shall &s;top to hear your theme,</L>
<L>Then &s;adly murmur to the plaintive &s;hore</L>
<L>MARCELLUS is no more!</L>
<L>And feeble Echo from her aery cave</L>
<L>Shall back return the note, and ev'ry vale,</L>
<L>With all its flow'rs &s;hall droop to hear the tale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How can he lie unwept who knew to rai&s;e</L>
<L>E&s;teem and love in every loyal heart.</L>
<L>He was the pride of ev'ry Shepherd's prai&s;e,</L>
<L>Grac'd with each decent and each princely part.</L>
<L>Nor did the mu&s;e ungrateful pour her lays;</L>
<L>He oft wou'd li&s;ten to the poet's art:</L>
<L>And oft alone, beneath the mu&s;e's grot,</L>
<L>Hid from a nation's eye, he &s;at and thought.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="4">
<L>Full many an hour, his Offspring pratling round,</L>
<L>In gentle dalliance has he fondly &s;mil'd;</L>
<L>Full many an hour, &s;eque&s;ter'd from annoys,</L>
<L>In tender amorous talk, has he beguil'd,</L>
<L>With the dear Partner of his deare&s;t joys.</L>
<L>Mean while the foe of Life, with treacherous art,</L>
<L>In &s;ly de&s;truction prey'd upon his heart;</L>
<L>And yet no fatal &s;ymptom did appear;</L>
<L>The blood &s;till mantled on his ro&s;y cheek.</L>
<L>As <HI>Phaebus</HI> oft the clouds with gold doth &s;treak,</L>
<L>While brooding &s;torms engender in the air.</L>
</LG>

<L>Where was your knowledge then, you &s;apient Tribe,</L>
<L>That boa&s;t commandment o'er the pul&s;e of life?</L>
<L>Was not a Prince&s;s' tears &s;ufficient bribe,</L>
<L>Cou'd not a King's, a Nation's pray'rs prevail</L>
<L>To make your nice&s;t &s;kill explore his ail?</L>
<L>Some few more Years the breath of Life &s;upply,</L>
<L>And keep him from the Sky&mdash;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="5">
Ah me, what boots your &s;kill?&mdash;Not all the pray'rs</L>
<L>That pale <HI>Britannia,</HI> and her King might pour;</L>
<L>Not all <HI>Augu&s;ta</HI>'s &s;adly-flowing Tears,</L>
<L>Not <HI>Ae&s;culapius'</HI> Sons with all their care,</L>
<L>Might ward the black inevitable hour.</L>
<L>Or could their Prince's vital Band repair,</L>
<L>Which in their mood the fatal Si&s;ters tore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ala&s;s, he droop'd in life's mature&s;t age,</L>
<L>While <HI>Albion</HI>'s &s;ceptre hung before his view;</L>
<L>And thrice the wi&s;e <HI>Machaon</HI> did pre&s;age</L>
<L>That <HI>Febris</HI> her inflaming rage withdrew;</L>
<L>Yet then renewing her malignant &s;trife,</L>
<L>The deadly Fiend unhous'd his tender Life.</L>
<L>Then &s;tream'd the tear from ev'ry <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> eye.</L>
<L>But chief th' unhappy &s;ire, in di&s;mal plight,</L>
<L>Dete&s;ts the odious light,</L>
<L>And with loud wailings tears the arched &s;ky.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="6">
And calls on death to bring a kind reprieve,</L>
<L>And lay his cruel &s;orrows in the grave.</L>

<L>But ah! my Mu&s;e, how may thy voice record,</L>
<L>Tho' well I ween thou &s;har'&s;t her piteous &s;tate,</L>
<L>The tender unimaginable woe,</L>
<L>Of his dear Con&s;ort for her ravi&s;h'd Lord,</L>
<L>Torn by the hand of unrelenting Fate!</L>
<L>Then hide the tears thou can&s;t not give to flow.</L>
<L>Enough, that when reviving life did cha&s;e</L>
<L>Death's di&s;mal image from her pallid face;</L>
<L>With manly &s;hew &s;he ma&s;k'd her &s;orrows dread;</L>
<L>And greatly &s;trove to chear with kind relief</L>
<L>Her tender Offspring's &s;ympathetic grief,</L>
<L>Who at their Mother's wretched plight grew &s;ad.</L>
<L>What heart &s;o &s;tony but did melt in tears?</L>
<L>See pale <HI>Britannia</HI> wears,</L>
<L>Thro' all her Sons, one di&s;mal face of woe.</L>
<L>Nor <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> eyes alone do overflow;</L>

By Ocean's wat'ry barrier &s;under'd far,</L>

<L>Night's drowzy ear, with tollings, deep and &s;low;</L>

<L>The winking Lamps a du&s;ky lu&s;tre &s;hed</L>
<L>Along the Man&s;ions of the Dead,</L>
<L>Where mould'ring Kings in &s;ilent du&s;t repo&s;e.</L>
<L>And now with often interrupted &s;ighs,</L>
<L>The Lawn-rob'd Prelate his la&s;t duty pays,</L>
<L>And du&s;t to du&s;t conveys:</L>
<L>And now entomb'd his &s;acred body lies,</L>
<L>Free from the cares, that this vain life enclo&s;e.</L>
<L>Up to yon regions of eternal day,</L>
<L>The free, unbodied &s;pirit wings its way;</L>
<L>There in the bo&s;om of its god doth bide</L>
<L>In pure, immaculate, un&s;haken bli&s;s;</L>
<L>Nor recks the lo&s;s of earthly Kingdom's pride,</L>
