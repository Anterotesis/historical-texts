<P>Mr. COLMAN'S conduct re&s;pecting this lit|tle Piece is its own panegyric. The fir&s;t &s;cenes were &s;ent to that gentleman anonymou&s;ly: he deemed them not de&s;titute of merit, and there|fore encouraged the Author to compleat the re&s;t. Mr. COLMAN has &s;ince devoted the utmo&s;t care and attention to prepare the Piece for repre&s;entation; and, in &s;hort, has intere&s;ted him&s;elf warmly in its &s;ucce&s;s, though the Author remains unknown to him.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>PRAY let me alone, Captain Wilmot&mdash;you forget that you are making love to me in&s;tead of my mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. Wilmot.</SPEAKER>
<P>"Why faith, Kitty, your beauty is &s;o much a type of my dear Charlotte's, that, like a Roman Catholic, I almo&s;t adore the <HI>image</HI> for its likene&s;s to the <HI>&s;aint.</HI>"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>"Well," let us leave fooling&mdash;and con&s;i|der how you are to &s;ecure Mi&s;s Charlotte&mdash;You find her father, old Bootekin, is re&s;olved to marry her to his nephew Bob.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. Wilmot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I have a &s;cheme to pre|vent that.&mdash;But tell me, Kitty, how did this <HI>rage</HI> for Engli&s;h Readings reach a town &s;o far from London?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mrs. Poplin, the Iri&s;h mantua-maker, who came down from London, introduced it&mdash;
<PB N="6" REF="5">
You know from the moment that my ma&s;ter quit|ted bu&s;ine&s;s, as a &s;hoemaker in town, and came down here to live on his <HI>means,</HI> Mrs. Poplin and he cou'd never &s;et their hor&s;es together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. Wilmot.</SPEAKER>
<P>"I think they quarrel'd who &s;hou'd have the be&s;t <HI>pew</HI> at church."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>"And ever &s;ince have been at open war.&mdash;Mrs. Poplin <HI>took the field</HI> by giving a ball; and tho' old Bootekin hates the &s;ound of a fiddle, he let all the heavy-heel'd ru&s;tics in the neighbourhood <HI>right hand and left</HI> in our hall, till they made the hou&s;e &s;hake to its founda|tion.&mdash;Next, the lady had card-parties;&mdash;deter|min'd not to be behind-hand, the old man quitted his pipe and bottle for <HI>Loo</HI> and <HI>Pope Joan.</HI>"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. Wilmot.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now the whim of burle&s;que|ing a rational and elegant amu&s;ement&mdash;giving <HI>Readings,</HI> has &s;eiz'd her lady&s;hip&mdash;he is to have the &s;ame on a more exten&s;ive &s;cale of ab&s;urdity&mdash;"as if re&s;olv'd that all his follies, like the <HI>&s;hadows</HI> of her's, &s;hall not only keep pace with, but become <HI>larger</HI> than their <HI>originals.</HI>"</P>
<STAGE>Enter CHARLOTTE.</STAGE>
<P>Well, my dear Charlotte, what news?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charlotte.</SPEAKER>
<P>My father has ju&s;t told me that I am to marry my hopeful cou&s;in, Bob Bootekin, next week.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. Wilmot.</SPEAKER>
<P>How unfortunate!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charlotte.</SPEAKER>
<P>How <HI>fortunate</HI> you mean&mdash;if he had left my choice free, ten to one if I &s;hou'd have come to a re&s;olution for this twelvemonth; but an attempt to force my inclinations drives me to a determination at once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. Wilmot.</SPEAKER>
<P>"Charming Charlotte!"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>"Take her at her word, Sir.&mdash;The cap|tain

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charlotte.</SPEAKER>
<P>"Aye&mdash;but then I &s;hall be &s;o clo&s;ely watch'd."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. Wilmot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll contrive to put them off their guard, and make this &s;cheme of the <HI>Read|ings</HI> turn to our advantage&mdash;"if we can but per|&s;uade your father to alter the place of exhibi|tion from his own hou&s;e to the large room at the George Inn."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hu&s;h!&mdash;Lud, Mi&s;s Charlotte, here comes your father&mdash;and that booby, Di&s;mal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. Wilmot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I mu&s;t e'en quit the field&mdash;but while I can carry off &s;o charming a prize, <HI>retreat</HI> is victory.</P>

<P>Well, ma&s;ter, I have done&mdash;I'll &s;ay no more.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bootekin.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what &s;ignifies your <HI>&s;aying</HI> no more&mdash;your cur&s;ed inflexible countenance has contradiction in every feature.&mdash;When I liv'd in London, I dreaded your appearance in the &s;hop&mdash;the very &s;ight of you put my cu&s;tomers in ill hu|mour&mdash;and they then were &s;ure to &s;wear their &s;hoes did not fit 'em.</P>

<P>No more I an't&mdash;I never read but two books in my life&mdash;my <HI>ca&s;h-book,</HI> and my <HI>jour|nal</HI>&mdash;but I'm re&s;olved to like reading now, from mere oppo&s;ition&mdash;What the devil, an't I a bet|ter gentleman, by a <HI>hundred</HI> a year, than any man in the neighbourhood?&mdash;and &s;hall a paultry man|tua-maker&mdash;a walking <HI>pincu&s;hion</HI>&mdash;a <HI>remnant</HI> of old tabby, pretend to give <HI>Readings,</HI> when I hardly know whether I can read or not?</P>
