<HEAD>TO THE Right Honorable, and Publick-Spirited, The <HI>Pre&s;ident, Officers,</HI> and <HI>Committee,</HI> OF THE SOCIETY FOR <HI>Encouragement</HI> of LEARNING.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords, and Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LEST it &s;hou'd be con&s;ider'd as a Di&s;regard of Pro|priety, when a Poem of a <HI>Satirical</HI> Species, is ad|dre&s;s'd to the Patronage mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h'd for Ex|tent of Humanity, plea&s;e to receive it, as a poetical <HI>Janus</HI>; of who&s;e Oppo&s;ite two Faces, the faire&s;t and be&s;t drawn you will find to be <HI>Panegyric.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, on That Side, you were <HI>attach'd.</HI>&mdash;And, &s;uch devoted Admirers of the <HI>Life</HI> wou'd with Difficulty have been brought to allow a <HI>Re&s;emblance</HI> in the <HI>Picture.</HI> Whereas, on the Side of the <HI>Satire,</HI> you cou'd not po&s;|&s;ibly
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
be Parties concerned: and were, therefore, be&s;t qualify'd, to judge it, impartially.</P>
<P>YET, &s;ince it is not by any Merit of mine, that you are &s;o &s;afe on the Satirical Quarter, It was fit I &s;hou'd do <HI>&s;omething,</HI> that might have room to expect your Acknow|ledgment. I have, therefore, declin'd any <HI>Encomium</HI> on your generous Society; or on Any of its particular Mem|bers: tho', to Every Reader, <HI>not &s;uch,</HI> It wou'd have in|creas'd the <HI>Delight</HI> of the Poem.</P>
<P>BUT, You are &s;uch Enemies to every Kind of <HI>Corrup|tion,</HI> that I apprehended the very Appearance, of an Attempt at evading your <HI>Judgment,</HI> by engaging your <HI>Genero&s;ity</HI> in my Favour.</P>
<P>IN this Situation, there are pre&s;erv'd to you all the na|tural Rights of the <HI>Critic.</HI> Yet, I am under no Pain from the U&s;e you may make of that Freedom: For, what candid Writer wou'd wi&s;h to e&s;cape a Reproach, where, being &s;ure of its <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> he can be made but the Wi&s;er, from Effect of its <HI>Severity?</HI> And, as to the more de&s;irable <HI>Rever&s;e</HI> of the Pro&s;pect, no Man is in Danger of mi&s;&s;ing your <HI>Approbation,</HI> unle&s;s he has, no where, <HI>de&s;erved</HI> it.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Mu&s;es</HI> have u&s;ed you too kindly, not to expect your <HI>Concern,</HI> for the Fate you will find 'em reduc'd to: And, to hear of <HI>your</HI> Grief, and good Wi&s;hes in their Be|half, may, from the Knowledge they have of your <HI>Con&s;e|quence,</HI>
<PB N="v" REF="4">
de&s;erve to be thought little le&s;s, than a <HI>Balance,</HI> for the Neglect they are under, from Thou&s;ands.</P>
<P>BUT, to &s;peak a plain Truth, without <HI>Metaphor,</HI> what|ever Advantage the Poetical World wou'd have deriv'd from imaginary <HI>Mu&s;es,</HI> might be, <HI>really,</HI> an Effect, of &s;ome &s;uch confederate Influence as yours, in good Earne&s;t ex|erted.</P>
<P>HOW many great and de&s;irable Changes in literate Ta&s;te, may we not rea&s;onably expect, from the a&s;&s;ociated Preva|lence of Numbers, united, as <HI>you</HI> are, upon the mo&s;t ge|nerous Principle in Nature, an unprofitable and voluntary Pur&s;uit of the Benefit of Others, from Effect of your own Co&s;t, and Labour?</P>
<P>TO in&s;tance, in One, the mo&s;t obvious and ea&s;y of many: How &s;oon wou'd our pre&s;ent low Reli&s;h for <HI>dra|matical Buffoonery</HI> give Way, to your <HI>nobler Example?</HI>&mdash;per&s;evering (indeed, with &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary Ob&s;tinacy) to applaud, and &s;upport, good <HI>Tragedy</HI> and <HI>Comedy:</HI> till what is now but mere <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> might have the Honour to be con&s;ider'd as <HI>Fa&s;hion</HI>&mdash;by Concurrence of your munifi|cent Endeavours, but for one or two &s;hort Winters?</P>
<P>AND, yet, what a National Deliverance were This!&mdash;With what Effu&s;ion of <HI>unmercenary</HI> Gratitude would it immortalize tho&s;e generous Conquerors, who, protecting the noble&s;t of our Youth from bad Principles, had, by
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
expelling Mean-&s;piritedne&s;s, Corruption, and Folly, from our <HI>Theatres,</HI> intercepted them in their Pa&s;&s;age upward, into Situations whence their Effects, extended wider, be|come in Proportion more dreadful.</P>
<P>WHATEVER Mi&s;conceptions have ari&s;en, with View to your more immediate and particular good Purpo&s;e, from its Relation to the <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion</HI> of a con&s;iderable Body, in Trade, who&s;e Intere&s;t may appear to be concern'd, not in the <HI>Intention,</HI> but <HI>Effect,</HI> of your E&s;tabli&s;hment, There will never, I am per&s;uaded, lie any Objection at all again&s;t this opener and ea&s;ier Road, to the Redemption of one Branch of Polite Learning, that &s;tands in too vi&s;ible Need of your Patronage.</P>
<P>AND, now, &s;ince All the Motive I had to this di&s;tant Addre&s;s was the Plea&s;ure of profe&s;&s;ing, in public, my Re|&s;pect for &s;o <HI>public</HI> a <HI>Spirit</HI>; you will forgive me, that I with-hold from your Knowledge a Di&s;covery of &s;o little Importance, as the <HI>Name,</HI> of</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>NOT a&s;&s;uming &s;uch an Air of Authority, as to give Rules, much le&s;s <HI>Examples,</HI> of Writing, the Author in the fol|lowing Ver&s;es intended no more, than an humble Attempt, from mere private Curio&s;ity, upon an Idea of <HI>Satire,</HI> which appear'd to be <HI>New:</HI> or not <HI>practis'd.</HI></P>
<P>There is indeed, &s;omething &s;o like <HI>Cruelty</HI> in the <HI>Face</HI> of that Species of Poetry, that it can only be reconcil'd to <HI>Humanity,</HI> by the general Benevolence of its <HI>Purpo&s;e:</HI> attacking Particulars, for the Public Advantage.</P>
<P>But, methinks, It gives up this <HI>End,</HI> (which is Reformation) when, mi&s;taking the <HI>Means,</HI> It attempts the good Work with a Hand either too <HI>rough,</HI> or too <HI>gentle.</HI></P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Ca&s;e, It <HI>corrodes,</HI> where It profe&s;&s;es to <HI>cure:</HI> In the &s;econd, It is only &s;portive and wanton, with what It &s;hou'd <HI>correct,</HI> and di&s;countenance.</P>
<P>The <HI>Medium</HI> perhaps might be found, in an Art like that of the <HI>Painters:</HI> who, by oppo&s;ing their <HI>Shades</HI> again&s;t <HI>LIGHTS,</HI> call out Darkne&s;s into open Di&s;tinction.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="7">So, Enormities, which <HI>Satiri&s;ts</HI> wou'd cen&s;ure, are but dimly and imperfectly mark'd, till the <HI>Defect</HI> admits Di&s;grace, from the Neighbourhood of <HI>Perfection.</HI>&mdash;Then Contempt &s;tings more &s;carply, in <HI>One,</HI> by the compar'd Admiration of the <HI>Other:</HI> Be|&s;ides, that the Cen&s;ur'd are driven, at the &s;ame Time, from their la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t little Refuge of Vanity, and can no longer recriminate upon the Cen&s;urer his <HI>Ill-nature,</HI> and Malevolence of Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I am afraid, there is another Particular, that calls aloud for the Regard of the <HI>Satiri&s;t:</HI> and That is, a Reflexion, how far Decency may make it a <HI>Duty,</HI> to abandon his per&s;onal Self, and in&s;inuate Opinions, with <HI>Mode&s;ty.</HI> I mean from the Mouth of &s;ome <HI>figurative Speaker,</HI> whom He ought to <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> of more Con|&s;equence; and who&s;e Sentiments the Reader will <HI>be &s;ure</HI> to receive with le&s;s Scruple.</P>
<P>There is a Meaning, in the very <HI>Name,</HI> of a <HI>Poet,</HI> that &s;hou'd &s;eem to pre&s;cribe us this Duty: And the U&s;e and Nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>In|vention</HI> can never be more manife&s;t, than where the Subject is &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">vidious, as <HI>Satire.</HI></P>
<P>Who is there, to &s;ay Truth, &s;o unguilty of the Follies of Life, that he dares, in his own proper Per&s;on, &s;tand out and <HI>ju&s;tify</HI> the Right he a&s;&s;umes, of reproaching the Conduct of Others?</P>
<P>Reproof is too bitter a Potion, to be welcome from our Sen&s;e of its <HI>U&s;e.</HI> And the admini&s;tring Hand &s;hou'd be <HI>dear,</HI> not <HI>di&s;gu&s;tful,</HI> if it would incline us to ta&s;te it, with Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>I thought it but nece&s;&s;ary, to prefix this &s;hort Note, to an E&s;|&s;ay toward a <HI>New Kind of Satire.</HI> I will not pretend to a&s;&s;ert my own Sy&s;tem: becau&s;e it is the mo&s;t probable Thing in the World, that I &s;hou'd conceive a <HI>mi&s;taken Idea.</HI> Yet, &s;ince by frequent At|tempts and Mi&s;carriages, there are &s;tarted, at lea&s;t, &s;ome good <HI>Hints,</HI> He, who&s;e fal&s;e Steps have contributed either to the Caution, or Direction, of Others, may be &s;aid to have <HI>err'd, with Good Fortune.</HI></P>
