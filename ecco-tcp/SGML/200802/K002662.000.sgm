<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>HE, who (in any Station of Life) depends on the Publick, cannot pay too great a De|ference or Regard to 'em; 'tis his Intere&s;t and his Duty; from which Motive alone, the following Letters are &s;ubmitted to the Peru&s;al of the Humane, the Sen&s;ible, the Candid, and Impar|tial. The unhappy injur'd Per&s;on who wrote 'em, hopes, they will be regarded as an opening only, to a Ca&s;e to be publi&s;h'd at a convenient Opportunity; wherein, 'tis po&s;&s;ible, it will be made appear,&mdash;however great a Man's Injuries,&mdash;however ag|gravating the Circum&s;tances,&mdash;it may not al|ways prove the highe&s;t Prudence to expect Repa|ration from Law; &s;ince, however excellent the Laws may be, however worthy and upright the&mdash;; however wi&s;e and learned the&mdash;; nay tho' a&mdash;, &s;hould be wholly unbias'd, or unpre|judic'd;&mdash;What Defence can there be again&s;t un&s;u&s;pected Treachery, and a clo&s;e laid Con&s;pi|racy? A Series of which, can be prov'd to have been acted, a long Time (particularly by a Set of the mo&s;t unworthy, ungrateful People,
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
that ever any one, by Marriage, was unfortu|nately ally'd to) again&s;t a Man, who&s;e gro&s;&s;e&s;t Crimes, perhaps, will appear to have been, Cre|dulity, Indi&s;cretion, and a too forgiving Temper.</P>
<P>It may not be improper to premi&s;e the Readers, there is not a &s;ingle Fact hinted at, in the&s;e Let|ters, that many living Witne&s;&s;es do not know to be Truth: And as to the Marriage Articles mentioned in 'em; on their being examin'd by able Lawyers, they appear'd to be not worth one Shilling to the Wife, tho' they were drawn by a Per&s;on, cho&s;e by her own Family, who&s;e Trouble the Husband hand&s;omely rewarded: The Hus|band has &s;corn'd to take any bad Advantage of 'em, tho' 'tis evident, they were never de&s;ign'd in his Favour.</P>
<P>The Verdict, in a pa&s;t Trial, is not complain|ed of; 'twas all the Money too much for the Woman, and more than the Husband ever de|&s;ir'd to receive, tho' not equal, perhaps (as &s;ome may think) to the Damages and Injuries the Re|lations, the Friends, the Children, and the Cre|ditors of that Husband may have &s;u&s;tained by the Cau&s;e of Trial. Had the Husband's Views been mercenary, there are many Men of Honour living who know, a private Compo&s;ition was frequently propos'd, and as con&s;tantly rejected, in a proper Manner. The Readers are left to make their own Remarks on the following Epi|&s;tles, and only entreated to con&s;ider, the different Times and Sea&s;ons they were wrote in; as well as to allow for the Agitations of the Author's di&s;tracted Mind; and then, if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;u&s;|pend
<PB N="v" REF="4">
their final Judgment 'till the whole is impartially &s;tated, and &s;ubmitted to 'em. And &s;hould it appear, creditable Witne&s;&s;es are living, who, if call'd, would have confronted the Guil|ty, and confuted many fal&s;e, &s;candalous and vile A&s;&s;ertions, made to the Prejudice of the Plain|tiff; What can be &s;aid? or what may not be thought? As the Author of the&s;e is well known and ready, on Occa&s;ion, to appear (and as they contain Truth alone) 'tis left to the Con&s;ideration of the impartial Reader what Sort of Countenance, or Belief, ought to be given to any Libels, publi&s;h|ed as pretended An&s;wers, &s;hould any &s;uch appear, (as has been too frequently, and ba&s;ely practis'd again&s;t many) di&s;pers'd by unknown Hands.</P>
<P>Should the Husband, in Time, recover his Sen&s;es enough, even to &s;mile at the romantic Stuff and &s;ublime Non&s;en&s;e, he, in his Extravagance of frantic Pa&s;&s;ion may (when wandring Abroad) have wrote to the Wife at Home;&mdash;nay, &s;hould he, hereafter, endeavour to divert Others with what may have made him too long &s;erious, 'tis hop'd, 'twill not be imputed to him, as any Breach of good Manners, or Morality: If there are any &s;uch &s;evere, grave Thinkers, he humbly begs Leave to &s;ay to 'em, (with the philo&s;ophical Satiri&s;t)
<Q>Ridentem dicere Verum quis vetat?</Q>
But to detain the Readers no longer, the follow|ing Pages are left to their Cen&s;ure or Ap|probation, with this Intimation alone,&mdash;No|thing

but the la&s;t Nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould have occa&s;ion'd the printing of what was meant for a private Peru&s;al only. They were not, when wrote, de&s;ign'd for publick View, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but flow'd from the Weakne&s;s of his blind Infatuation and pa&s;&s;ionate wounded Heart, who&s;e cooler Judgment now convinces him, the Per&s;ons they are addre&s;&s;ed to, de&s;erv'd not a &s;ingle Line from him.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A Letter from the Husband to the Wife <HI>(once thought virtuous)</HI> left for her in her Servant's Hands the Day before the Husband went Abroad, which was on <HI>Sunday April</HI> the 16th, 1738, &s;he having confe&s;&s;ed her Love for another.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Deare&s;t <HI>Su&s;anna Maria,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_NOT Strength of Con&s;titution, Spirits, Re&s;olution, Rea&s;on, or all I can call to my A&s;&s;i&s;tance, will, I find, pre|vent my having a violent Fit of Ill|ne&s;s which increa&s;es daily: If God plea&s;es to di&s;mi&s;s me this Life, it will be an Act of Mer|cy. My Heart trembles, my Sen&s;es &s;tagger, what a State of De&s;pair! I own the Hand of Providence, and &s;ubmit to its eternal Ju&s;tice; my Condition is greatly terrible: My own Faults glare upon me, and Self convicted I own; I ought to &s;uffer much, yet, &s;ure, mine is the heavie&s;t Calamity that ever oppre&s;s'd hu|man Nature: How vain, were an Attempt, to expre&s;s it in Words: 'Tis not to be conceiv'd; 'tis only to be felt, and felt by me alone.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="7">Where is the Religion, where the un&s;potted Truth, the whiten'd Innocence, that once &s;hone out, &s;o brightly, in a certain Mind? All lo&s;t! I hope not irrecoverably lo&s;t, in violent Pa&s;&s;ions and wild Notions, that impo&s;e upon the Under&s;tanding, and mi&s;lead the Mind be|nighted, 'till the Day may break and waken us, from cheating Dreams, to Certainty of Pain.</P>
<P>I have broke off to addre&s;s the Almighty with a truly penitent, contrite Heart, with bit|ter Tears, unfeign'd Sorrow: Do you join in the Prayer; humbly implore that great divine In&s;tructor, to illuminate your Mind, to waken a Sen&s;e of Truth, and convince, that without &s;uch A&s;&s;i&s;tance, our own Rea&s;on is too weak to let us know when we err. The Indul|gence of &s;trong Pa&s;&s;ions will never permit us to judge candidly. How nece&s;&s;ary is it to beg Grace of the divine Power; to do it fervently and unfeignedly, 'tis the only true Check on our wrong Thoughts, that otherwi&s;e lead us to wrong Actions; one brings on another, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to avoid it, if not timely &s;topp'd. How di&s;mal are my Nights? How mi&s;erable my Days? Oh, Child, be cautious, le&s;t, too late, you own with me, 'tis a bitter aggravating Cir|cum&s;tance of Sorrow, to be con&s;cious, our Follies may, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure have de&s;erv'd it. May the ju&s;t, the all-gracious God, hear, and be my Witne&s;s, &s;ince I was married, that I never thought of any one, with the Ideas of Love, but my own dear Wife; whom now I
<PB N="3" REF="8">
love with all the E&s;teem, Tenderne&s;s, cordial Affection, and fond Concern, that ever po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd the Brea&s;t of Man, as a Husband or Lover: No Parent, not even a Mother, can more fondly dote on her only new-born Child. That I have been heretofore negligent of my Per&s;on, my Fortune, and Character, with Shame and Sorrow, I own; and God only knows how terrible my Puni&s;hment! He far|ther knows, and may his gracious unbounded Mercy &s;trengthen my Mind to an hone&s;t Re|&s;olution: He al&s;o knows, I &s;ay, how de&s;irous I am of being ju&s;t for the Time to come. I'll not incourage the lea&s;t contrary Thought, nor omit ought may lead me to that Hap|pine&s;s. May my Crimes be pardon'd, as I par|don all committed towards me. Would the indulgent Omnipotent recall the dear wander|ing Heart, who&s;e Lo&s;s I mourn with Agony; be Witne&s;s, God, with what a Rapture my Heart would open, to receive the Ble&s;&s;ing; and never, in a &s;ingle Thought, would dare to reprove, or chide, the too dear Frail One: Heaven grant this, or I am lo&s;t for ever.</P>
<P>My Heart's Fondling, my deare&s;t <HI>Molly,</HI> you may have the &s;ole Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and full Command, of the Heart of a Husband that beats to you alone; that wi&s;hes, the vital Blood may no longer warm it, than while it flows for you. Take Example of Heaven, and da&s;h not away the Tears of Penitence: I have been highly too blame, and I as truly repent, I will err no more, I here give up
<PB N="4" REF="9">
all Views of idle Plea&s;ures, all Vanities what|&s;oever; I will live very near, that I may re|cover my Circum&s;tances, I give up every Thing, but your <HI>Heart</HI>; let me recover that Trea&s;ure, and I &s;hall repine at nothing; my Heart will be delighted in Exta&s;y, while I can &s;ee your Countenance &s;mile, and wear the Looks of cordial Affection.</P>
<P>Return and &s;ave me from the la&s;t Mi&s;ery; my Sen&s;es will certainly be lo&s;t, if not my Life, unle&s;s this happens: Human Nature can't &s;upport it long. Sure you will, you will re|turn; I mu&s;t not &s;uppo&s;e you could bear to think, you were unhappily the Cau&s;e of my untimely End, and thereby hazard my Soul's eternal Re&s;t: All Right of Command I change to Intreaty, and fondly implore this of you. No Indulgence &s;hall equal mine, and think, how glorious the Triumph will be, when Hu|manity and Virtue conquers unwarrantable Pa&s;|&s;ions; it is the greate&s;t Progre&s;s we can make towards reaching divine Perfection: Such a Victory is a nobler In&s;tance of a great Mind than can be given by tho&s;e who never had Struggle: On one Side, appears Comfort and everla&s;ting Happine&s;s, warranted, and protect|ed, by the Laws of God and Man: On the other, I dare not paint it, the Pro&s;pect is too indelicate, for me, to &s;hew you, and too terrible for us both to look at. I mu&s;t, tho' with a bleeding Heart, &s;ay &s;omething, tho' very poorly, expre&s;&s;ive of the Truth; Is it not for the pre&s;ent Indulgence of unju&s;tifiable Pa&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="5" REF="10">
and deceiving Plea&s;ures; Is it not hoarding up of perpetual Mi&s;eries to come? Minds may change! Re&s;entments may awake! unfore&s;een Revolutions may happen, and Shame and Scorn en&s;ue! Truth will conquer all. You are high in the E&s;teem of the Be&s;t; lo&s;e it not for God's Sake: Think of your Days of Innocence and Delight; awake the Memory of tho&s;e Joys, tho&s;e con&s;cious Joys, we have known; return, return entire, and give a Joy beyond 'em all; crown the Evening of my Life with this Ble&s;s|ing, and have my eternal Prayers. Experi|ence will teach us; Bread and Water, with &s;uch Reflections, afford greater Delight than all the namele&s;s Vanities that Luxury, in all its deceitful Shapes, can give; &s;uch cannot la&s;t, and Mi&s;ery mu&s;t be the Con&s;equence: Revive the Memory of your own dear Innocence; let not fal&s;e Names cheat you to mi&s;take &s;ome|thing for it that is not it. Save my Life, &s;ave my Soul, and of a mi&s;erable Object of De&s;pair, make me the happie&s;t of Men: My Heart &s;prings at the Thought: But alas! it &s;inks again, and &s;wells, with throbbing Grief, to think it is not &s;o: Yet let me hope it tho'&mdash;If nothing but my everla&s;ting Ruin can con|tent you, you may &s;oon enjoy the Sacrifice; but have more Regard to your&s;elf, your Rela|tions, your Friends, and the aching Heart of a forgiving, a repentant, and truly affectionate Husband: Think how you have been delight|ed to &s;ee my Name joined thereto, and by ble&s;&s;ing me, beyond Expre&s;&s;ion, renew tho&s;e
<PB N="6" REF="11">
Delights, &s;uch as will give our Hearts more la&s;ting, real Joy, than all we can propo&s;e be|&s;ide. Had God permitted our tender Babes to have remained on Earth, tho&s;e innocent Angels would have pleaded in my Behalf be|yond the Rhetorick of Man, much more be|yond all my poor di&s;concerted Brain will enable me to &s;ay. I would proceed, but big Pa&s;&s;ions choak me: I have been torn by many, but my Love and Concern for you conquers all.</P>
<P>Let me not imagine any thing can entirely efface the Memory of a Husband, whom, you own, you entertain'd as the fir&s;t welcome Gue&s;t of an innocent Heart: Let no &s;econd Thought, for God's Sake, drive me quite from thence; you know my E&s;teem of you is &s;o great, &s;o fond my Opinion of you, my tender Heart has been more ready to form Excu&s;es for you, than you to make 'em&mdash;My Dear, Affliction is a ju&s;t, tho' &s;evere Monitor, the &s;incere&s;t Friend; it &s;hews the Truth; I &s;ee, I feel it. To declare I lo&s;e my Appetite, that I want Sleep, are but poor In&s;tances of Pain: I want much more, I want my Peace of Mind; you alone can re&s;tore it. Kneel, kneel, and implore the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of our great Creator; to tru&s;t alone to our fallible Mind, is running on in Error; it leads to Perdition: Be a&s;&s;ur'd, this is &s;o, and may the Almighty Power waken you to a right Sen&s;e, e'er mine is lo&s;t in Madne&s;s: My Pro&s;|pects, otherwi&s;e, are the&s;e, a lingring Death in a Jail, Madne&s;s in <HI>Bedlam,</HI> a broken Heart, or the terrible Chance, that in &s;ome Fren&s;y of
<PB N="7" REF="12">
my Pa&s;&s;ion, I may at once ru&s;h into that Eter|nity, of which, the wi&s;e&s;t Man is but an arro|gant Fool, who pre&s;umes he can give a full and certain Notion; and then, where's my Re|treat? From all this, you, and you alone can &s;ave me. The Recovery of thee, my ine&s;ti|mable Jewel, would give a Tran&s;port to my Heart, beyond all I ever knew; that were a bridal Hour indeed! Then my Mind might calm to give me leave to look into my Affairs, which, if this happens, are not irretrieveable; but one cannot be without the other. My Hor&s;es, and all Superfluities, belonging to me, I &s;hall order to be &s;old; I am determined to think nothing nece&s;&s;ary but what may merely keep me clean, and &s;ub&s;i&s;t me; and &s;hall em|ploy one, among my Creditors, who &s;hall make &s;uch rea&s;onable Propo&s;als, as I cannot but think will be comply'd with. If Riding is nece&s;&s;ary for you, as I think it may, I can have your little Mare, or borrow &s;ome other for you, and you cannot have a faithfuller Servant, than my|&s;elf, to attend you. Give me my Peace of Mind, give me your&s;elf, give me your Heart&mdash;your Mind, my Soul's Darling, my only Com|fort and remaining Hope; and what cannot I undertake and accompli&s;h, with his great A&s;&s;i&s;tance, who&s;e Aid I &s;hall frequently im|plore; the Repetition of which, you well know, is the only Way to keep our Mind in a right Habit. Let not fal&s;e Notions, glo&s;s'd over with &s;pecious Appearances, win you from the&s;e Thoughts; I would be delicately tender of
<PB N="8" REF="13">
&s;hocking your Mind with rude Images, yet, Duty compels me, gently to inform you, in the Way you are, you are trying to &s;teal your Heart again&s;t a fond, tho' erring Husband, but a truly penitent one; 'tis driving from your Mind all conjugal Affections, &s;etting at nought the Peace of all Relations, all Friends, and ri&s;quing your own eternal Quiet; 'tis teaching your&s;elf a &s;trange unhappy Le&s;&s;on; 'tis plung|ing in Guilt, believe it; oh God! 'tis fearing your Con&s;cience, mid&s;t all the Calamities and Di&s;appointments you ever met: Examine your Mind and tell me; Did there not appear great Solace from the Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a well di&s;|po&s;ed and warrantable Inclination, and gave not Religion a Comfort, which nought el&s;e can &s;o effectually do? I have been too well ac|quainted with the Volence of &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ions, and know how much they blind our Rea&s;on: But Truth will prevail at la&s;t, and when we find that has not been our Guide, how &s;hock|ing our Condition! Your true&s;t Friend tells you this, who knows it, by &s;ad Experience; profit by the Example: The Struggle will over pay it&s;elf. Ah! my Life, I wi&s;h not to cure the Wounds of your dear Mind with Corro&s;ives; I would pour the Balm of Comfort, tho' I am mentioning what is a Dagger in my Heart; but thy kind Hand can remove it, and I will draw a Veil over it, that the Operation may not too &s;trongly affect you: Think this,&mdash;Ju&s;tice, Honour, Duty, all the Ties of Religion, Vir|tue, Truth, and Humanity, plead my unhap|py

Cau&s;e; your not complying, ends in the Ruin of all; it mu&s;t end in mine, and, which, to me, appears &s;till wor&s;e, I fear your own De&s;truction. I here, in expre&s;s Terms, de|clare, what's pa&s;s'd I forgive, and nothing, but the Prevention of my future Ea&s;e, &s;hall ever rouze a Thought of it in me; nor do I de&s;ire a better Security, for my Quiet, than your own Word: Be a&s;&s;ur'd, all unwarrantable Pa&s;|&s;ions are to be got the better of, with much more Ea&s;e, and le&s;s Time, than tho&s;e which Virtue in&s;pires, which Honour warrants, which Truth demands, and which 'tis unju&s;t to waver in, but more heinous not to recover, to cheri&s;h and &s;upport. Wi&s;er Heads than mine, may dre&s;s up other Sentiments in a more plea&s;ing Garb; but Time alone will convince, there's nothing &s;o charming (however other Things may be artfully di&s;guis'd) as &s;imple, naked Truth. I have begg'd of God, and I hope he has heard my Prayers, to enable me to &s;up|pre&s;s all Pa&s;&s;ion, but one; that one ought to be indulg'd, my Love I mean: Again I re|peat it.&mdash;I'll &s;hew no Ill-Will or Re&s;entment to any; no Thought, but what terminates in an hone&s;t De&s;ire of making my dear Wife happy: Wife and Husband are the tendere&s;t Names; do not lo&s;e all Sen&s;e of 'em. Re|trieve me from Perdition, my Heart's Darling, and be, in a true literal Sen&s;e, my Guardian Angel.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A Letter from the Husband, in Town, to a Gentleman <HI>(once thought a Friend.)</HI> Deli|ver'd into his own Hands, in the Country, by a Man Servant, the latter End of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1738.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THO' the Occa&s;ion of my writing to you is the mo&s;t extraordinary that ever was, I &s;hall come to the Point, without Ceremo|ny. A certain fine Lady [who&s;e Name I never choo&s;e to mention again] will, by that Time you have this, receive a Letter, to inform her of my determin'd Re&s;olution as to her&s;elf: Something remains to be &s;aid to you, Sir. I
<PB N="11" REF="16">
mu&s;t forget I ever look'd on you with a friend|ly Eye, or, as a Gentleman, whom, perhaps, I once greatly e&s;teem'd, and thought my&s;elf honour'd in Acquaintance: How I ought to think of you, or act towards you now, Sir, let your own Under&s;tanding determine for me, in Spite of Prejudice to me, or your own Self-Love. I mu&s;t now change the Stile I have often talk'd to you in; but I &s;hall be calm, tho' determinate; and, as I &s;corn to &s;peak be|neath a Gentleman, you need not apprehend ought unfitting a Gentleman to hear. Reflect, Sir, how much Ruin I owe to the mo&s;t de|ceitful of Women: And what &s;hall I call you, Sir? the mo&s;t artful of Men. Can you have &s;o &s;trong a Sen&s;e of Pride and Shame, as you &s;ay you have, and not blu&s;h, when you reflect how much you have made me the unhap|pie&s;t of Men. You know you have; by my G&mdash;d you do: You have &s;een me &s;inking under the mo&s;t calamitous heart-felt Angui&s;h and Agony, while I &s;mother'd Pa&s;&s;ions in my Brea&s;t, that di&s;order'd my Sen&s;es, and were near depriving me of Life: I blu&s;h to think I have endur'd &s;o much. But nothing le&s;s than Extreams could have cur'd me of that exce&s;|&s;ive, that uncommon, I mu&s;t now add, &s;hame|ful Love, that I once had for the unworthie&s;t of Women.&mdash;I cannot &s;ay le&s;s of her, and &s;corn to &s;ay more, I own, I have often de|bated with my&s;elf, whether I &s;hould not have de&s;troy'd you, her, and my&s;elf; I have had it in my Power, could I have reconcil'd my Mind
<PB N="12" REF="17">
to &s;o damn'd, &s;o execrable an Action. I am not a&s;ham'd to avow, Sir, I believe in a God, and think Self-Murder the mo&s;t impudent Crime can be committed towards him; tho' I have had too many melancholy Debates with my&s;elf thereon: Nay, I think it, indeed, in one Sen&s;e, a cowardly Act: My farther Thoughts, on that Subject, I have no need to explain now.&mdash;As to her, I could not bear the Idea of hurting, what was once, too dear, too precious to me; I will not &s;ay now how much &s;o: And for you, Sir, let me tell you, while I had the lea&s;t Interval of Rea&s;on, I could not but &s;corn a ba&s;e, malicious Re&s;ent|ment, even to the Man who has depriv'd me of all I once thought valuable. I have had my Cure from her own flagrant Behaviour: But I will not be &s;o meanly ungenerous, to &s;ay all I think of her to you; do you think of her Ingratitude (to &s;ay the lea&s;t) towards me, as a high Merit to you. If the &s;tronge&s;t Guilt can de&s;erve a favourable Thought, you owe it to her.&mdash;Sir, I mu&s;t tell you plainly, I know now, I believe, the whole Progre&s;s of a de|te&s;ted Affair, even from the Ma&s;querade and Chappel Meetings you had long &s;ince; yes, Sir, and the dear Lady's beginning a literary Corre&s;pondence, at a Time, when, I believe, I may &s;afely call God to Witne&s;s, I had never exchang'd three Words with you; nay, bare|ly recollected your Face, and &s;carcely remem|bred your Name; (you mu&s;t know, and ought to own this) I thank the delicate Dame for

the Commencement of our Acquaintance.

<P>I Am about to write to you for the la&s;t Time, con&s;equently may be drawn into a long Letter, as I purpo&s;e, never more, but once, to &s;et my Hand to ought concerning you; I mean, by that once, when I may &s;ign an In|&s;trument that may leave you to all that Liberty your own Licentiou&s;ne&s;s has made Choice of;&mdash;you know, &s;ome Time ago, I bid you prepare for a determin'd Separation, which Re&s;olution, no Con&s;equence upon Earth &s;hall &s;hake. Re|member 'tis your own &s;eeking&mdash;'Twas your own Choice, at a Time when I was running di&s;tracted, and breaking my Heart Abroad, for what I blu&s;h to have ever &s;et &s;o much Va|lue on: Your Behaviour, and my own Re|flections, have fix'd my Mind irrevocable.

to act again&s;t his Thought, is, I think, unpardonable.</P>
<P>I am greatly at a Lo&s;s to proceed, &s;ince what can I &s;ay to you that will not be &s;hocking, (tho' I &s;hall &s;ay nothing but Truth) unle&s;s I were to demean my&s;elf, if po&s;&s;ible, more than I have done, &s;o much have I been lo&s;t in Love, (and a fond, fooli&s;h Hope of recovering what I ought not to have &s;ought after) which Love you have torn from my Heart by the Roots, yes, Madam, entirely; tho' I once lov'd to Folly and Madne&s;s: My only Obligation to you is, you have ab&s;olutely cur'd me, which not long &s;ince, I thought could never have hap|pen'd. I think a generous good-natur'd Mind &s;hould be &s;low to &s;u&s;pect, as Humanity will be ready to forgive; how mine have been de|ceiv'd, I have been too &s;urely convinc'd by un|deniable Facts, and the Confe&s;&s;ions gain'd from your&s;elf. However wildly I may often have appear'd in general to have acted, yet, in Matters of the highe&s;t Con&s;equence, you may have had &s;ome Proof: I can be &s;trangely &s;teady, can keep my Mind to my&s;elf, can &s;ift to the very Bottom of Things, am &s;low in my De|termination; and being fix'd, no Power, no Force, no Threat, no Bribe, no Terror, nor any Temptation whatever can alter me, know|ing my Re&s;olves are grounded on Truth, Ho|nour and Ju&s;tice.

Your cunning Artifice, your &s;trange Conduct in having private Meetings (long &s;ince, and all un&s;u&s;pected by me) at Chapels, Ma&s;que|rades, and Places that &s;hock me to think of; and your &s;low and &s;ly Manner of drawing me into an Intimacy, an Acquaintance and Friend|&s;hip; and &s;cheming my being under Obliga|tions, have made me &s;tart, but now I could al|mo&s;t &s;mile at 'em: And all this ere I had the lea&s;t Imagination or Sugge&s;tion that you either had &s;uffered, or would &s;uffer any one to whi&s;|per a &s;ingle Accent of Love in your Ear; nay,

before I knew a certain Per&s;on had even (in publick or private) ever exchang'd a Syllable with you. Thou &s;trange, &s;trange Creature! never had Man greater Confidence, nor was ever Confidence more ungenerou&s;ly betray'd than mine has been. Your pre&s;uming to lay a Plan for our living together, on &s;uch auda|cious Terms as you cou'd propo&s;e, makes me &s;hudder to think you cou'd utter 'em; while I &s;mile at your ridiculous Folly that cou'd &s;up|po&s;e I would go thro' with it. I chu&s;e to &s;mile, Madam, becau&s;e I &s;corn to be angry with what is become beneath my Re&s;entment. You have cho&s;e &s;trange Extreams, Madam, and, I thank God, tho&s;e Extreams have cur'd me. Ma|dam, no Con&s;ideration upon Earth &s;hall ever make me again eat a Meal with you, nor &s;leep under the &s;ame Roof; nor dare to think I will ever have the lea&s;t Obligation or Friend&s;hip from you; your Lip or Hand I never more will offer to touch, and all I expect of you is good Manners and Di&s;tance, if ever we are com|pell'd by any Accident to meet again; tho' I own I could wi&s;h we were never more to &s;ee each other. I &s;hall talk to you, Madam, by a third Per&s;on only, whom I &s;hall pitch upon with Caution: What's proper for you to wear, Madam, you &s;hall have; but I have no For|tune to compliment away, and have enough to do with that little, that extreme little that belongs to me. I once thought it an Honour to call you by my Name,&mdash;gue&s;s what I think it now; however &s;light, or lowly you have
<PB N="30" REF="35">
taught your&s;elf to think of me, you'll find I have Re&s;olution enough yet to act with &s;trict Ju&s;tice and Honour, to all who ought to ex|pect or demand it from me. Waken'd from my unhappy Lethargy of Love, Recollection now awakens to my Memory innumerable In|&s;tances, long &s;ince pa&s;t, of your mercenary Self-love, Deceit, and Ba&s;ene&s;s of Mind to|wards me, that had remained unheeded, but for &s;ome &s;hocking Provocations which recall the Remembrance of 'em, and ju&s;tify me in a &s;trong Belief (rather let me &s;ay A&s;&s;urance) you never meant to act ju&s;tly by me; or ever was what I once fondly thought you. I now can &s;ee thro' you clearly, Madam;&mdash;when I ca&s;t my Eyes over your Letters, I can point out the Places where a &s;uperior Under&s;tanding to your own was the Dictator; and what &s;hocks me to think of is, even the Feeling, the Humanity, or Tenderne&s;s towards me, that may appear in 'em, I am now convinc'd was Art; tho&s;e feign'd Sentiments came not from your Heart, I am certain; I rather ow'd 'em to another,&mdash;&s;hock|ing, aggravating Circum&s;tance of your Guilt and Folly! You artfully kept alive my Love, to take Advantage of my Weakne&s;s; ba&s;e Wretch! Can I, on Reflection, think otherwi&s;e? What &s;ignifies your Words, when your Ac|tions have &s;poke you too plain to me? How readily you catch'd at my Words when I pro|pos'd going abroad, to remove a painful Object from your Eyes? The Ceremony indeed appear'd to &s;hock you,&mdash;why? alas! my fond Credulity
<PB N="31" REF="36">
then mi&s;interpreted all; but now I'll tell you the true Rea&s;ons, Madam, and God forgive me if I injure you: You were hurt, not from what I was to &s;uffer, but from the Hazards you ran your&s;elf; your Pride began to be a|larm'd, le&s;t you &s;hou'd lo&s;e that Reputation your Virtue &s;hou'd have de&s;erv'd. 'Twas un|doubtedly, no plea&s;ant Circum&s;tance (to think of me only in the Light of a Companion, that had often added to your Entertainment and Mirth) to &s;ee a Man bur&s;ting with Ago|ny, yet, endeavouring to &s;upport him&s;elf with Spirit, turning his Back on his native Country, with a Thought of never beholding it more: Nor was it agreeable to &s;ee my Furniture thrown in a Heap, de&s;igned for Sale, which it never &s;hould have been, but that I knew not other|wi&s;e (till I could fix &s;ome Scheme or Re&s;olu|tion) how to &s;upport my&s;elf abroad, unle&s;s I had been as low in my Mind as your &s;imple Lady&s;hip was pleas'd to think me, and wou'd have &s;ubmitted to have ow'd my Support where I wou'd &s;ooner have &s;acrific'd my Life. How dar'd you, Madam, to have &s;uch an audacious in&s;ulting Thought of me? If I dwell on it I &s;hall lo&s;e my Temper, and talk beneath my|&s;elf. You know my little Support was from my|&s;elf alone. I will &s;uppo&s;e, at that Juncture too, your Con&s;cience &s;tir'd within you, and mov'd your Countenance to &s;uch expre&s;&s;ive Looks as even now I cannot bear the Thought of; and I mu&s;t pau&s;e e'er I can go on&mdash;Cur&s;e on the Weakne&s;s that &s;tops me. I ought, while I talk

to you, to dive&s;t my&s;elf of all Feeling and Humanity, of Memory if po&s;&s;ible; yet let me recollect; you let me go, and, Madam, &s;pite of your Art, &s;pite of all Di&s;gui&s;e, I cou'd find, by your Writing, your Mind felt a Relief the Moment you heard I was landed on another Shore. How unhappy my Life was there I &s;corn to tell you now. But how were you alarm'd when I thought of returning, when you pretended (I had like to have &s;aid impu|dently) you wou'd live with me again, if I pleas'd; but the Conditions were &s;o pretty, I mu&s;t laugh, Madam, le&s;t a ju&s;t Anger &s;hou'd waken me to Terms I &s;corn to u&s;e; tho' all wou'd be far &s;hort of your De&s;ervings; you, who cou'd pretend to be in your Sen&s;es, and dare to think &s;o damnably of me. I mu&s;t break off, for how can I go on? Is it a Sub|ject to &s;mile at? Mon&s;trous! after all I have endur'd, &s;hould I revive any &s;oft Ideas in my Memory? 'twere the Extreme of Folly: Shall I be angry? I owe more to my own Pride than to think you worth it. I find &s;uch Variety of Thoughts pour in upon me, I mu&s;t determine to ha&s;ten to a Conclu&s;ion, or this Subject will be endle&s;s; whatever may remain to be &s;aid, I &s;hall think of, and deliver el&s;ewhere.</P>
