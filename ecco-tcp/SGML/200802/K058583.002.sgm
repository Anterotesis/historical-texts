<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<P>ALMORAN had now reached the gallery; and when the mul|titude &s;aw him, they &s;houted as in tri|umph, and demanded that he &s;hould &s;urrender. HAMET, who al&s;o perceived him at a di&s;tance, and was unwilling that any violence &s;hould be offered to
<PB N="2" REF="4">
his per&s;on, pre&s;&s;ed forward, and when he was come near, commanded &s;ilence. At this moment ALMORAN, with a loud voice, reproached them with im|piety and folly; and appealing to the power, whom in his per&s;on they had offended, the air &s;uddenly grew dark, a flood of lightning de&s;cended from the &s;ky, and a peal of thunder was ar|ticulated into the&s;e words:
<Q><L>Divided &s;way, the God who reigns alone</L>
<L>Abhors; and gives to ALMORAN the throne.</L></Q></P>
<P>The multitude &s;tood agha&s;t at the prodigy; and hiding their faces with their hands, every one departed in &s;i|lence and confu&s;ion, and HAMET and OMAR were left alone. OMAR was taken by &s;ome of the &s;oldiers who had
<PB N="3" REF="5">
adhered to ALMORAN, but HAMET made his e&s;cape.</P>
<P>ALMORAN, who&s;e wi&s;hes were thus far accompli&s;hed by the intervention of a power &s;uperior to his own, exulted in the anticipation of that happine&s;s which he now &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ecured; and was fortified in his opinion, that he had been wretched only becau&s;e he had been weak, and that to multiply and not to &s;uppre&s;s his wi&s;hes was the way to acquire felicity.</P>
<P>As he was returning from the gallery, he was met by O&s;myn and Caled, who had heard the &s;upernatural declaration in his behalf, and learned its effects. ALMORAN, in that ha&s;ty flow of un|bounded but capricious favour, which,
<PB N="4" REF="6">
in contracted minds, is the effect only of unexpected good fortune, rai&s;ed O&s;myn from his feet to his bo&s;om: 'As in the trial,' &s;aid he, <Q>thou ha&s;t been faithful, I now inve&s;t thee with a &s;uperior tru&s;t. The toils of &s;tate &s;hall from this moment devolve upon thee; and from this moment, the delights of empire unallayed &s;hall be mine: I will recline at ea&s;e, re|mote from every eye but tho&s;e that reflect my own felicity; the felicity that I &s;hall ta&s;te in &s;ecret, &s;urround|ed by the &s;miles of beauty, and the gaities of youth. Like heaven, I will reign un&s;een; and like heaven, though un&s;een, I will be adored.</Q> O&s;myn received this delegation of power with a tumultuous plea&s;ure, that was expre&s;&s;ed only by &s;ilence and con|fu&s;ion.
<PB N="5" REF="7">
ALMORAN remarked it; and exulting in the pride of power, he &s;ud|denly changed his a&s;pect, and regard|ing O&s;myn, who was yet blu&s;hing, and who&s;e eyes were &s;wimming in tears of gratitude, with a &s;tern and ardent coun|tenance; 'Let me, however,' &s;aid he, <Q>warn thee to be watchful in thy tru&s;t: beware, that no rude commotion vio|late my peace by thy fault; le&s;t my anger &s;weep thee in a moment to de|&s;truction.</Q> He then directed his eye to Caled: 'And thou too,' &s;aid he, <Q>ha&s;t been faithful; be thou next in honour and in power to O&s;myn. Guard both of you my paradi&s;e from dread and care; fulfill the duty that I have a&s;&s;igned you, and live.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8">
He was then informed by a me&s;&s;en|ger, that HAMET had e&s;caped, and that OMAR was taken. As he now de&s;pi&s;ed the power both of HAMET and OMAR, he expre&s;&s;ed neither concern nor anger that HAMET had fled; but he ordered OMAR to be brought be|fore him.</P>
<P>When OMAR appeared bound and di&s;armed, he regarded him with a &s;mile of in&s;ult and deri&s;ion; and a&s;ked him, what he had now to hope. <Q>I have, indeed,</Q> &s;aid OMAR, <Q>much le&s;s to hope, than thou ha&s;t to fear.</Q> <Q>Thy in&s;olence,</Q> &s;aid ALMORAN, <Q>is equal to thy folly: what power on earth is there, that I &s;hould fear?</Q> <Q>Thy own,</Q> &s;aid OMAR. <Q>I have not lei|&s;ure now,</Q> replied ALMORAN, <Q>to
<PB N="7" REF="9">
hear the paradoxes of thy philo&s;ophy explained: but to &s;hew thee, that I fear not thy power, thou &s;halt live. I will leave thee to hopele&s;s regret; to wiles that have been &s;corned and defeated; to the unheeded pe|tulance of dotage; to the fondne&s;s that is repayed with neglect; to re&s;t|le&s;s wi&s;hes, to credulous hopes, and to derided command: to the &s;low and complicated torture of de&s;pi&s;ed old age; and that, when thou &s;halt long have abhorred thy being, &s;hall de&s;troy it.</Q> 'The mi&s;ery,' &s;aid OMAR, <Q>which thou ha&s;t menaced, it is not in thy power to inflict. As thou ha&s;t taken from me all that I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the bounty of thy father, it is true that I am poor; it is true al&s;o, that my knees are now feeble, and
<PB N="8" REF="10">
bend with the weight of years that is upon me. I am, as thou art, a man; and therefore I have erred: but I have &s;till kept the narrow path in view with a faithful vigilance, and to that I have &s;oon returned: the pa&s;t, therefore, I do not regret; and the fu|ture I have no cau&s;e to fear. In Him who is mo&s;t merciful, I have hope; and in that hope even now I rejoice before thee. My portion in the pre|&s;ent hour, is adver&s;ity: but I receive it, not only with humility, but thank|fulne&s;s; for I know, that whatever is ordained is be&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>ALMORAN, in who&s;e heart there were no traces of OMAR'S virtue, and therefore no foundation for his confi|dence; &s;u&s;tained him&s;elf again&s;t their
<PB N="9" REF="11">
force, by treating them as hypocri&s;y and affectation: 'I know,' &s;ays he, <Q>that thou ha&s;t long learned to eccho the &s;pecious and pompous &s;ounds, by which hypocrites conceal their wretch|edne&s;s, and excite the admiration of folly and the contempt of wi&s;dom: yet thy walk in this place, &s;hall be &s;till unre&s;trained. Here the &s;plendor of my felicity &s;hall fill thy heart with envy, and cover thy face with con|fu&s;ion; and from thee &s;hall the world be in&s;tructed, that the enemies of ALMORAN can move no pa&s;&s;ion in his brea&s;t but contempt, and that mo&s;t to puni&s;h them is to permit them to live.</Q></P>
<P>OMAR, who&s;e eye had till now been fixed upon the ground, regarded AL|MORAN
<PB N="10" REF="12">
with a calm but &s;teady counte|nance: 'Here then,' &s;aid he, <Q>will I follow thee, con&s;tant as thy &s;hadow; tho</Q>, as thy &s;hadow, <Q>unnoticed or ne|glected: here &s;hall mine eye watch tho&s;e evils, that were appointed from everla&s;ting to attend upon guilt: and here &s;hall my voice warn thee of their approach. From thy brea&s;t may they be averted by righteou&s;ne&s;s! for without this, though all the worlds that roll above thee &s;hould, to aid thee, unite all their power, that power can aid thee only to be wretched.</Q></P>
<P>ALMORAN, in all the pride of gra|tified ambition, inve&s;ted with domi|nion that had no limits, and allied with powers that were more than mor|tal;
<PB N="11" REF="13">
was overawed by this addre&s;s, and his countenance grew pale. But the next moment, di&s;daining to be thus controuled by the voice of a &s;lave, his cheeks were &s;uffu&s;ed with the blu&s;hes of indignation: he turned from OMAR, in &s;corn, anger, and confu&s;ion, without reply; and OMAR departed with the calm dignity of a benevolent and &s;upe|rior being, to whom the &s;miles and frowns of terre&s;trial tyranny were alike indifferent, and in whom abhorrence of the turpitude of vice was mingled with compa&s;&s;ion for its folly.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<P>IN the mean time, ALMEIDA, who had been conveyed to an apart|ment in ALMORAN's &s;eraglio, and de|livered to the care of tho&s;e who attend|ed upon his women, &s;uffered all that grief and terror could inflict upon a ge|nerous, a tender, and a delicate mind; yet in this complicated di&s;tre&s;s, her at|tention was principally fixed upon HAMET. The di&s;appointment of his hope, and the violation of his right, were the chief objects of her regret and her fears, in all that had already happened, and in all that was &s;till to come; every in&s;ult that might be of|fered
<PB N="13" REF="15">
to her&s;elf, &s;he con&s;idered as an injury to him. Yet the thoughts of all that he might &s;uffer in her per&s;on, gave way to her apprehen&s;ions of what might befall him in his own: in his &s;i|tuation, every calamity that her imagi|nation could conceive, was po&s;&s;ible; her thoughts were, therefore, bewil|dered amid&s;t an endle&s;s variety of dreadful images, which &s;tarted up be|fore them which way &s;oever they were turned; and it was impo&s;&s;ible that &s;he could gain any certain intelligence of his fate, as the &s;plendid pri&s;on in which &s;he was now confined, was &s;urrounded by mutes and eunuchs, of whom no|thing could be learned, or in who&s;e re|port no confidence could be placed.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="16">
While her mind was in this &s;tate of agitation and di&s;tre&s;s, &s;he perceived the door open, and the next mo|ment ALMORAN entered the apartment. When &s;he &s;aw him, &s;he turned from him with a look of unutterable an|gui&s;h; and hiding her face in her veil, &s;he bur&s;t into tears. The tyrant was moved with her di&s;tre&s;s; for unfeel|ing obduracy is the vice only of the old, who&s;e &s;en&s;ibility has been worn away by the habitual perpetration of reiterated wrongs.</P>
<P>He approached her with looks of kindne&s;s, and his voice was involun|tarily modulated to pity; &s;he was, however, too much ab&s;orbed in her own &s;orrows, to reply. He gazed upon her with tenderne&s;s and admira|tion;
<PB N="15" REF="17">
and taking her hand into his own, he pre&s;&s;ed it ardently to his bo|&s;om: his compa&s;&s;ion &s;oon kindled into de&s;ire, and from &s;oothing her di&s;tre&s;s, he began to &s;olicit her love. This in|&s;tantly rou&s;ed her attention, and re|&s;entment now &s;u&s;pended her grief: &s;he turned from him with a firm and haughty &s;tep, and in&s;tead of an&s;wer|ing his profe&s;&s;ions, reproached him with her wrongs. ALMORAN, that he might at once addre&s;s her virtue and her pa&s;|&s;ions, ob&s;erved, that though he had lov|ed her from the fir&s;t moment he had &s;een her, yet he had concealed his pa&s;&s;ion even from her, till it had received the &s;anction of an invi&s;ible and &s;uperior pow|er; that he came, therefore, the me&s;|&s;enger of heaven; and that he offered her unrivalled empire and everla&s;ting
<PB N="16" REF="18">
love. To this &s;he an&s;wered only by an impatient and fond enquiry after HAMET. 'Think not of HAMET,' &s;aid ALMORAN; <Q>for why &s;hould he who is rejected of Heaven, be &s;till the fa|vourite of ALMEIDA?</Q> 'If thy hand,' &s;aid ALMEIDA, <Q>could quench in everla&s;ting darkne&s;s, that vital &s;park of intellectual fire, which the word of the Almighty has kindled in my brea&s;t to burn for ever, then might ALMEIDA cea&s;e to think of HAMET; but while that &s;hall live, whatever form it &s;hall inhabit, or in whatever world it &s;hall re&s;ide, his image &s;hall be for ever pre&s;ent, and to him &s;hall my love be for ever true.</Q> This glowing declaration of her love for HA|MET, was immediately &s;ucceeded by a tender anxiety for his &s;afety; and a &s;ud|den
<PB N="17" REF="19">
reflection upon the probability of his death, and the danger of his &s;itua|tion if alive, threw her again into tears.</P>
<P>ALMORAN, whom the ardour and impetuo&s;ity of her pa&s;&s;ions kept &s;ome|times &s;ilent, and &s;ometimes threw into confu&s;ion, again attempted to &s;ooth and comfort her: &s;he often urged him to tell her what was become of his bro|ther, and he as often evaded the que&s;|tion. As &s;he was about to renew her enquiry, and reflected that it had al|ready been often made, and had not yet been an&s;wered, &s;he thought that AL|MORAN had already put him to death: this threw her into a new agony, of which he did not immediately di&s;cover the cau&s;e; but as he &s;oon learned it from
<PB N="18" REF="20">
her reproaches and exclamations, he perceived that he could not hope to be heard, while &s;he was in doubt about the &s;afety of HAMET. In order, there|fore, to &s;ooth her mind, and pre|vent its being longer po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an image that excluded every other; he a&s;&s;umed a look of concern and a&s;toni&s;h|ment at the imputation of a crime, which was at once &s;o horrid and &s;o un|nece&s;&s;ary. After a &s;olemn deprecation of &s;uch enormous guilt, he ob&s;erved, that as it was now impo&s;&s;ible for HA|MET to &s;ucceed as his rival, either in empire or in love, without the breach of a command, which he knew his vir|tue would implicitly obey; he had no motive either to de&s;ire his death, or to re&s;train his liberty: 'His walk,' &s;ays he, <Q>is &s;till uncircum&s;cribed in
<PB N="19" REF="21">
Per&s;ia; and except this chamber, there is no part of the palace to which he is not admitted.</Q></P>
<P>To this declaration ALMEIDA li&s;t|ened, as to the mu&s;ic of paradi&s;e; and it &s;u&s;pended for a-while every pa&s;&s;ion, but her love: the &s;udden ea&s;e of her mind made her regardle&s;s of all about her, and &s;he had in this interval &s;uffered ALMORAN to remove her veil, without reflecting upon what he was doing. The moment &s;he recollected her&s;elf, &s;he made a gentle effort to recover it, with &s;ome confu&s;ion, but without an|ger. The plea&s;ure that was expre&s;&s;ed in her eyes, the blu&s;h that glowed up|on her cheek, and the conte&s;t about the veil, which to an amorous imagina|tion had an air of dalliance, concurred
<PB N="20" REF="22">
to heighten the pa&s;&s;ion of ALMORAN almo&s;t to phren&s;y: &s;he perceived her danger in his looks, and her &s;pirits in|&s;tantly took the alarm. He &s;eized her hand, and gazing ardently upon her, he conjured her, with a tone and em|pha&s;is that &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed the tu|multuous vehemence of his wi&s;hes, that &s;he would renounce the rites which had been forbidden above, and that &s;he would receive him to whom by mi|racle &s;he had been alloted.</P>
<P>ALMEIDA, whom the manner and voice of ALMORAN had terrified into &s;ilence, an&s;wered him at fir&s;t only with a look that expre&s;&s;ed aver&s;ion and di&s;|dain, over-awed by fear. <Q>Wilt thou not,</Q> &s;aid ALMORAN, <Q>fulfill the decrees of Heaven? I conjure thee,
<PB N="21" REF="23">
by Heaven, to an&s;wer.</Q> From this &s;olemn reference to Heaven, ALMEI|DA derived new fortitude: &s;he in|&s;tantly recollected, that &s;he &s;tood in the pre&s;ence of Him, by who&s;e per|mi&s;&s;ion only every other power, whe|ther vi&s;ible or invi&s;ible, can di&s;pen&s;e evil or good: 'Urge no more,' &s;aid &s;he, <Q>as the decree of Heaven, that which is incon&s;i&s;tent with Divine per|fection. Can He, in who&s;e hand my heart is, command me to wed the man whom he has not enabled me to love? Can the Pure, the Ju&s;t, the Merciful, have ordained that I &s;hould &s;uffer embraces which I loath, and violate vows which His laws per|mitted me to make? Can He have ordained a perfidious, a love|le&s;s, and a joyle&s;s pro&s;titution? What
<PB N="22" REF="24">
if a thou&s;and prodigies &s;hould con|cur to enforce it a thou&s;and times, the deed it&s;elf would be a &s;tronger proof that tho&s;e prodigies were the works of darkne&s;s, than tho&s;e prodi|gies that the deed was commanded by the Father of light.</Q></P>
<P>ALMORAN, who&s;e hopes were now bla&s;ted to the root, who perceived that the virtue of ALMEIDA could neither be deceived nor overborne; that &s;he at once contemned his power, and ab|horred his love; gave way to all the furies of his mind, which now &s;lum|bered no more: his countenance ex|pre&s;&s;ed at once anger, indignation, and de&s;pair; his ge&s;ture became furious, and his voice was lo&s;t in menaces and execrations. ALMEIDA beheld him
<PB N="23" REF="25">
with an earne&s;t yet &s;teady countenance, till he vowed to revenge the indignity he had &s;uffered, upon HAMET. At the name of HAMET, her fortitude for|&s;ook her; the pride of virtue gave way to the &s;oftne&s;s of love; her cheeks be|came pale, her lips trembled, and tak|ing hold of the robe of ALMORAN, &s;he threw her&s;elf at his feet. His fury was at fir&s;t &s;u&s;pended by hope and ex|pectation; but when from her words, which grief and terror had rendered &s;carce articulate, he could learn only that &s;he was pleading for HAMET, he bur&s;t from her in an exta&s;y of rage; and forcing his robe from her hand, with a violence that dragged her after it, he ru&s;hed out of the chamber, and left her pro&s;trate upon the ground.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="26">
As he pa&s;&s;ed through the gallery with a ha&s;ty and di&s;ordered pace, he was &s;een by OMAR; who knowing that he was returned from an interview with ALMEIDA, and conjecturing from his appearance what had happened, judged that he ought not to neglect this opportunity to warn him once more of the delu&s;ive phantoms, which, under the appearance of plea&s;ure, were lead|ing him to de&s;truction: he, therefore, followed him unperceived, till he had reached the apartment in which he had been u&s;ed to retire alone, and heard again the loud and tumultuous excla|mations, which were wrung from his heart by the angui&s;h of di&s;appoint|ment: 'What have I gained,' &s;aid he, <Q>by ab&s;olute dominion! The &s;lave who, &s;ecluded from the gales of life
<PB N="25" REF="27">
and from the light of heaven, toils without hope in the darkne&s;s of the mine, riots in the delights of para|di&s;e compared with me. By the ca|price of one woman, I am robbed not only of enjoyment but of peace, and condemned for ever to the tor|ment of un&s;atisfied de&s;ire.</Q></P>
<P>OMAR, who was impatient to ap|prize him that he was not alone, and to prevent his di&s;clo&s;ing &s;entiments which he wi&s;hed to conceal, now threw him&s;elf upon the ground at his feet. 'Pre&s;umptuous &s;lave!' &s;aid ALMO|RAN, <Q>from whence, and wherefore art thou come?</Q> 'I am come,' <Q>&s;aid OMAR, to tell thee that not the ca|price of a woman, but the wi&s;hes of ALMORAN, have made ALMORAN
<PB N="26" REF="28">
wretched.</Q> The king, &s;tung with the reproach, drew back, and with a fu|rious look laid his hand upon his poig|nard; but was immediately re&s;trained from drawing it, by his pride. <Q>I am come,</Q> &s;aid OMAR, <Q>to repeat that truth, upon which, great as thou art, thy fate is &s;u&s;pended. Thy power extends not to the mind of another; exert it, therefore, upon thy own: &s;uppre&s;s the wi&s;hes, which thou can&s;t not fulfill; and &s;ecure the happine&s;s that is within thy reach.</Q></P>
<P>ALMORAN, who could bear no lon|ger to hear the precepts which he di&s;|dained to practi&s;e, &s;ternly commanded OMAR to depart: 'Be gone,' &s;aid he, <Q>le&s;t I cru&s;h thee like a noi&s;ome rep|tile, which men cannot but abhor,
<PB N="27" REF="29">
though it is too contemptible to be feared.</Q> 'I go,' &s;aid OMAR, <Q>that my warning voice may yet again re|call thee to the path of wi&s;dom and of peace, if yet again I &s;hall behold thee while it is to be found.</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<P>ALMORAN was now left alone; and throwing him&s;elf upon a &s;ofa, he &s;at &s;ome time motionle&s;s and &s;ilent, as if all his faculties had been &s;u&s;pended in the &s;tupefaction of de&s;pair. He revolved in his mind the wi&s;hes that had been gratified, and the happi|ne&s;s of which he had been di&s;appoint|ed: 'I de&s;ired,' &s;aid he, <Q>the pomp and power of undivided dominion; and HAMET was driven from the throne which he &s;hared with me, by a voice from heaven: I de&s;ired to break off his marriage with ALMEI|DA; and it was broken off by a pro|digy,
<PB N="29" REF="31">
when no human power could have accompli&s;hed my de&s;ire. It was my wi&s;h al&s;o to have the per&s;on of ALMEIDA in my power, and this wi&s;h al&s;o has been gratified; yet I am &s;till wretched. But I am wretched, only becau&s;e the means have not been ade|quate to the end: what I have hi|therto obtained, I have not de&s;ired for it&s;elf; and of that, for which I de&s;ired it, I am not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed: I am, therefore, &s;till wretched, becau&s;e I am weak. With the &s;oul of ALMO|RAN, I &s;hould have the form of HA|MET: then my wi&s;hes would indeed be filled; then would ALMEIDA ble&s;s me with con&s;enting beauty, and the &s;plendor of my power &s;hould di&s;tin|gui&s;h only the intervals of my love; my enjoyments would then be certain

and permanent, neither bla&s;ted by di&s;appointment, nor withered by &s;a|tiety.</Q> When he had uttered the&s;e reflections with the utmo&s;t vehemence and agitation, his face was again ob|&s;cured by gloom and de&s;pair; his po&s;|ture was again fixed; and he was fall|ing back into his former &s;tate of &s;ilent ab&s;traction, when he was &s;uddenly rou&s;ed by the appearance of the Ge|nius, the &s;incerity of who&s;e friend|&s;hip he began to di&s;tru&s;t.</P>

great lu&s;tre, cut into a figure that had four and twenty &s;ides, on each of which was engraven a different letter. <Q>Thou &s;ee&s;t,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>this tali&s;man: on each &s;ide of it is engraven one of tho&s;e my&s;terious characters, of which are formed all the words of all the languages that are &s;poken by angels, genii, and men. This &s;hall enable thee to change thy figure: and what, under the form of ALMORAN, thou can&s;t not accompli&s;h; thou &s;halt &s;till be able to effect, if it can be effected by thee, in the form of any other. Point only to the letters that com|po&s;e the name of him who&s;e appear|ance thou would&s;t a&s;&s;ume, and it is done. Remember only, that upon him, who&s;e appearance thou &s;hall a&s;|&s;ume, thine &s;hall be impre&s;t, till thou
<PB N="32" REF="34">
re&s;tore&s;t his own. Hide the charm in thy bo&s;om, and avail thy&s;elf of its power.</Q> ALMORAN received the ta|li&s;man in a tran&s;port of gratitude and joy, and the Genius immediately di&s;|appeared.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of this tali&s;man was &s;o ob|vious, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to overlook it. ALMORAN in&s;tantly conceived the de&s;ign with which it was given, and determined in&s;tantly to put it in exe|cution: 'I will now,' &s;aid he, <Q>a&s;|&s;ume the figure of HAMET; and my love, in all its ardour, &s;hall be return|ed by ALMEIDA.</Q> As his fancy kind|led at the anticipation of his happine&s;s, he &s;tood mu&s;ing in a plea&s;ing &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and indulged him&s;elf in the contem|plation of the &s;everal gradations, by
<PB N="33" REF="35">
which he &s;hould a&s;cend to the &s;ummit of his wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at this moment, O&s;myn, whom he had commanded to attend him at this hour, approached his apartment: AL|MORAN was rou&s;ed by the &s;ound of his foot, and &s;uppo&s;ed it to be OMAR, who had again intruded upon his privacy; he was enraged at the interruption which had broken a &s;eries of imagina|tions &s;o flattering and luxurious; he &s;natched out his poignard, and lifting up his arm for the &s;troke, ha&s;tily turn|ed round to have &s;tabbed him; but &s;eeing O&s;myn, he di&s;covered his mi&s;take ju&s;t in time to prevent the blow.</P>
<P>O&s;myn, who was not con&s;cious of any crime, nor indeed of any act that
<PB N="34" REF="36">
could have given occa&s;ion of offence; &s;tarted back terrified and amazed, and &s;tood trembling in &s;u&s;pen&s;e whe|ther to remain or to withdraw. ALMO|RAN, in the mean time, &s;heathed the in&s;trument of death, and bid him fear nothing, for he &s;hould not be hurt. He then turned about; and putting his hand to his forehead, &s;tood again &s;ilent in a mu&s;ing po&s;ture: he recol|lected, that if he a&s;&s;umed the figure of HAMET, it was nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould give orders for HAMET to be admitted to ALMEIDA, as he would otherwi&s;e be excluded by the delegates of his own authority; turning, therefore, to O&s;myn, 'Remember,' &s;aid he, <Q>that whenever HAMET &s;hall return, it is my command, that he be admitted to ALMEIDA.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="37">
O&s;myn, who was plea&s;ed with an opportunity of recommending him&s;elf to ALMORAN, by prai&s;ing an act of ge|nerous virtue which he &s;uppo&s;ed him now to exert in favour of his brother, received the command with a look, that expre&s;&s;ed not only approbation but joy: 'Let the &s;word of de&s;truction,' &s;aid he, <Q>be the guard of the tyrant; the &s;trength of my lord &s;hall be the bonds of love: tho&s;e, who honour thee as ALMORAN, &s;hall rejoice in thee as the friend of HAMET.</Q> To ALMORAN, who was con&s;cious to no kindne&s;s for his brother, the prai&s;e of O&s;myn was a reproach: he was offend|ed at the joy which he &s;aw kindled in his countenance, by a command to &s;hew favour to HAMET; and was fired
<PB N="36" REF="38">
with &s;udden rage at that condemnation of his real conduct, which was implied by an encomium on the genero&s;ity of which he a&s;&s;umed the appearance for a malevolent and perfidious purpo&s;e: his brow was contracted, his lip quivered, and the hilt of his dagger was again gra&s;ped in his hand. O&s;myn was again overwhelmed with terror and confu&s;ion; he had again offended, but knew not his offence. In the mean time, ALMORAN recollecting that to expre&s;s di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t O&s;myn was to betray his own &s;ecret, endeavoured to &s;uppre&s;s his an|ger; but his anger was &s;ucceeded by remor&s;e, regret, and di&s;appointment. The angui&s;h of his mind broke out in imperfect murmurs: 'What I am, &s;aid he, <Q>is, to this wretch, the object not only of hatred but of &s;corn; and
<PB N="37" REF="39">
he commends only what I am not, in what to him I would &s;eem to be.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ounds, which, tho' not arti|culate, were yet uttered with great emotion, were &s;till mi&s;taken by O&s;|myn for the overflowings of capricious and cau&s;ele&s;s anger: 'My life,' &s;ays he to him&s;elf, <Q>is even now &s;u&s;pend|ed in a doubtful balance. When|ever I approach this tyrant, I tread the borders of de&s;truction: like a hood-winked wretch, who is left to wander near the brink of a precipice, I know my danger; but which way &s;oever I turn, I know not whether I &s;hall incur or avoid it.</Q></P>
<P>In the&s;e reflections, did the &s;ove|reign and the &s;lave pa&s;s tho&s;e moments,
<PB N="38" REF="40">
in which the &s;overeign intended to ren|der the &s;lave &s;ub&s;ervient to his plea&s;ure or his &s;ecurity, and the &s;lave intended to expre&s;s a zeal which he really felt, and a homage which his heart had al|ready paid. O&s;myn was at length, however, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with an a&s;&s;urance, that all was well; and ALMORAN was again left to reflect with angui&s;h upon the pa&s;t, to regret the pre&s;ent, and to anticipate the future with &s;olicitude, anxiety, and perturbation.</P>
<P>He was, however, determined to a&s;|&s;ume the figure of his brother, by the tali&s;man which had been put into his power by the Genius: but ju&s;t as he was about to form the &s;pell, he re|collected, that by the &s;ame act he would impre&s;s his own likene&s;s upon HAMET,
<PB N="39" REF="41">
who would con&s;equently be inve&s;ted with his power, and might u&s;e it to his de&s;truction. This held him &s;ome time in &s;u&s;pen&s;e: but reflecting that HA|MET might not, perhaps, be apprized of his advantage, till it was too late to improve it; that he was now a fugi|tive, and probably alone, leaving Per|&s;ia behind him with all the &s;peed he could make; and that, at the wor&s;t, if he &s;hould be &s;till near, if he &s;hould know the transformation as &s;oon as it &s;hould be made, and &s;hould in&s;tantly take the mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures to im|prove it; yet as he could di&s;&s;olve the charm in a moment, whenever it &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary for his &s;afety, no formi|dable danger could be incurred by the experiment, to which he, therefore, proceeded without delay.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<P>IN the mean time, HAMET, to whom his own &s;afety was of no importance but for the &s;ake of ALMEIDA, re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to conceal him&s;elf near the city. Having, therefore, reached the confines of the de&s;ert, by which it was bounded on the ea&s;t, he quitted his hor&s;e, and determined to remain there till the multitude was di&s;per&s;ed, and the darkne&s;s of the evening might con|ceal his return, when in le&s;s than an hour he could reach the palace.</P>
<P>He &s;at down at the foot of the mountain Kabe&s;&s;ed, without con&s;ider|ing,
<PB N="41" REF="43">
that in this place he was mo&s;t like|ly to be found, as tho&s;e who travel the de&s;ert &s;eldom fail to enter the cave that winds its way under the mountain, to drink of the water that i&s;&s;ues there from a clear and copious &s;pring.</P>
<P>He reviewed the &s;cenes of the day that was now nearly pa&s;&s;ed, with a mixture of a&s;toni&s;hment and di&s;tre&s;s, to which no de&s;cription can be equal. The &s;udden and amazing change that a few hours had made in his &s;ituation, appeared like a wild and di&s;tre&s;sful dream, from which he almo&s;t doubted whether he &s;hould not wake to the power and the felicity that he had lo&s;t. He &s;at &s;ome time bewildered in the hurry and multiplicity of his thoughts, and at length bur&s;t out into pa&s;&s;ionate
<PB N="42" REF="44">
exclamations: 'What,' &s;ays he, <Q>and where am I? Am I, indeed, HA|MET; that &s;on of Solyman who di|vided the dominion of Per&s;ia with his brother, and who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the love of ALMEIDA alone? Dreadful vici&s;&s;itude! I am now an outca&s;t, friendle&s;s and forlorn; without an a&s;|&s;ociate, and without a dwelling: for me the cup of adver&s;ity overflows, and the la&s;t dregs of &s;orrow have been wrung out for my portion: the powers not only of the earth, but of the air, have combined again&s;t me; and how can I &s;tand alone be|fore them? But is there no power that will interpo&s;e in my behalf? If He, who is &s;upreme, is good, I &s;hall not peri&s;h. But wherefore am I thus? Why &s;hould the de&s;ires of vice be
<PB N="43" REF="45">
accompli&s;hed by &s;uperior powers; and why &s;hould &s;uperior powers be permitted to di&s;appoint the expecta|tions of virtue? Yet let me not ra&s;hly que&s;tion the ways of Him, in who&s;e balance the world is weighed: by Him, every evil is rendered &s;ub|&s;ervient to good; and by His wi&s;dom, the happine&s;s of the whole is &s;ecured. Yet I am but a part only, and for a part only I can feel. To me, what is that goodne&s;s of which I do not partake? In my cup the gall is unmixed; and have I not, therefore, a right to complain? But what have I &s;aid? Let not the gloom that &s;ur|rounds me, hide from me the pro&s;|pect of immortality. Shall not eter|nity atone for time? Eternity, to which the duration of ages is but
<PB N="44" REF="46">
as an atom to a world! Shall I not, when this momentary &s;eparation is pa&s;t, again meet ALMEIDA to part no more? and &s;hall not a purer flame than burns upon the earth, unite us? Even at this moment, her mind, which not the frauds of &s;orcery can taint or alienate, is mine: that plea&s;ure which &s;he re&s;erved for me, cannot be taken by force; it is in the con&s;ent alone that it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts; and from the joy that &s;he feels, and from that only, proceeds the joy &s;he can be&s;tow.</Q></P>
<P>With the&s;e reflections he &s;oothed the angui&s;h of his mind, till the dreadful moment arrived, in which the power of the tali&s;man took place, and the fi|gure of ALMORAN was changed into
<PB N="45" REF="47">
that of HAMET, and the figure of HA|MET into that of ALMORAN.</P>
<P>At the moment of transformation, HAMET was &s;eized with a &s;udden lan|guor, and his faculties were &s;u&s;pended as by the &s;troke of death. When he recovered, his limbs &s;till trembled, and his lips were parched with thir&s;t: he ro&s;e, therefore, and entering the ca|vern, at the mouth of which he had been &s;itting, he &s;tooped over the well to drink; but glancing his eyes upon the water, he &s;aw, with a&s;toni&s;hment and horror, that it reflected, not his own countenance, but that of his bro|ther. He &s;tarted back from the pro|digy; and &s;upporting him&s;elf again&s;t the &s;ide of the rock, he &s;tood &s;ome time like a &s;tatue, without the power
<PB N="46" REF="48">
of recollection: but at length the thought &s;uddenly ru&s;hed into his mind, that the &s;ame &s;orcery which had &s;u&s;|pended his marriage, and driven him from the throne, was &s;till practi&s;ed again&s;t him; and that the change of his figure to that of ALMORAN, was the effect of ALMORAN's having a&s;&s;um|ed his likene&s;s, to obtain, in this di&s;|gui&s;e, whatever ALMEIDA could be|&s;tow. This thought, like a whirlwind of the de&s;ert, totally &s;ubverted his mind; his fortitude was borne down, and his hopes were rooted up; no principles remained to regulate his con|duct, but all was phren&s;y, confu&s;ion, and de&s;pair. He ru&s;hed out of the cave with a furious and di&s;tracted look; and went in ha&s;te towards the city, without having formed any de|&s;ign,
<PB N="47" REF="49">
or con&s;idered any con&s;equence that might follow.</P>
<P>The &s;hadows of the mountains were now lengthened by the declining &s;un; and the approach of evening had invited OMAR to meditate in a grove, that was adjacent to the gardens of the palace. From this place he was &s;een at &s;ome di&s;tance by HAMET, who came up to him with a ha&s;ty and di&s;ordered pace; and OMAR drew back with a cold and di&s;tant reverence, which the power and the character of ALMORAN concurred to excite. HAMET, not reflecting upon the cau&s;e of this behaviour, was of|fended, and reproached him with the want of that friend&s;hip he had &s;o often profe&s;&s;ed: the vehemence of his ex|pre&s;&s;ion and demeanor, &s;uited well with
<PB N="48" REF="50">
the appearance of ALMORAN; and OMAR, as the be&s;t proof of that friend|&s;hip which had been impeached, took this opportunity to repeat his admoni|tions in the behalf of HAMET: <Q>What ever evil,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>thou can&s;t bring upon HAMET, will be doubled to thy&s;elf: to his virtues, the Power that fills infinitude is a friend, and he can be afflicted only till they are per|fect; but thy &s;ufferings will be the puni&s;hment of vice, and as long as thou art vicious they mu&s;t increa&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>HAMET, who in&s;tantly recollected for whom he was mi&s;taken, and the angui&s;h of who&s;e mind was for a mo|ment &s;u&s;pended by this te&s;timony of e&s;teem and kindne&s;s, which could not po&s;&s;ibly be feigned, and which was
<PB N="49" REF="51">
paid him at the ri&s;que of life, when it could not be known that he received it; ran forward to embrace the hoary &s;age, who had been the guide of his youth, and cried out, in a voice that was broken by contending pa&s;&s;ions,
<Q><L>'The face is the face of ALMORAN;</L>
<L>'but the heart is the heart of HAMET.'</L></Q></P>
<P>OMAR was &s;truck dumb with a&s;to|ni&s;hment; and HAMET, who was impa|tient to be longer mi&s;taken, related all the circum&s;tances of his transforma|tion, and reminded him of &s;ome parti|culars which could be known only to them&s;elves: <Q>Can&s;t thou not yet be|lieve,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>that I am HAMET? when thou ha&s;t this day &s;een me bani&s;hed from my kingdom; when thou ha&s;t now met me a fugitive
<PB N="50" REF="52">
returning from the de&s;ert; and when I learnt from thee, &s;ince the &s;un was ri&s;en which is not yet &s;et, that more than mortal powers were combined again&s;t me.</Q> <Q>I now believe,</Q> &s;aid OMAR, <Q>that thou, indeed, art HAMET.</Q> <Q>Stay me not then, &s;aid HAMET;</Q> <Q>but come with me to revenge.</Q> 'Beware,' &s;aid O|MAR, <Q>le&s;t thou endanger the lo&s;s of more than empire and ALMEIDA.</Q> 'If not to revenge,' &s;aid HAMET, <Q>I may at lea&s;t be permitted to puni&s;h.</Q> 'Thy mind,' &s;ays OMAR, <Q>is now in &s;uch a &s;tate, that to puni&s;h the crimes by which thou ha&s;t been wronged, will dip thee in the guilt of blood. Why el&s;e are we forbidden to take vengeance for our&s;elves? and why is it re&s;erved as the prerogative of the
<PB N="51" REF="53">
Mo&s;t High? In Him, and in Him alone, it is goodne&s;s guided by wi&s;|dom: He approves the means, only as nece&s;&s;ary to the end; He wounds only to heal, and de&s;troys only to &s;ave; He has complacence, not in the evil, but in the good only which it is appointed to produce. Remember, therefore, that he, to whom the puni&s;hment of another is &s;weet; though his act may be ju&s;t with re&s;pect to others, with re|&s;pect to him&s;elf it is a deed of darkne&s;s, and abhorred by the Al|mighty.</Q> HAMET, who had &s;tood ab&s;tracted in the contemplation of the new injury he had &s;uffered, while OMAR was per&s;uading him not to revenge it, <Q>&s;tarted from his po&s;|ture in all the wildne&s;s of di&s;trac|tion;
<PB N="52" REF="54">
and bur&s;ting away from OMAR, with an ardent and furious look ha&s;ted toward the palace, and was &s;oon out of &s;ight.</Q></P>

<P>IN the mean time, ALMORAN, after having effected the transformation, was met, as he was going to the apart|ment of ALMEIDA, by O&s;myn. O&s;myn had already experienced the mi&s;ery of de|pendent greatne&s;s, that kept him conti|nually under the eye of a capricious ty|rant, who&s;e temper was various as the gales of &s;ummer, and who&s;e anger was &s;udden as the bolt of heaven; who&s;e purpo&s;e and pa&s;&s;ions were dark and im|petuous as the midnight &s;torm, and at who&s;e command death was inevita|ble as the approach of time. When
<PB N="54" REF="56">
he &s;aw ALMORAN, therefore, in the likene&s;s of HAMET, he felt a &s;ecret de&s;ire to apprize him of his &s;ituation, and offer him his friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>ALMORAN, who with the form a&s;|&s;umed the manners of HAMET, ad|dre&s;&s;ed O&s;myn with a mild though mournful countenance: 'At length,' &s;aid he, <Q>the will of ALMORAN alone is law; does it permit me to hold a private rank in this place, without mole&s;tation? It permits,</Q> &s;aid O&s;myn, <Q>yet more; he has commanded, that you &s;hould have admittance to AL|MEIDA.</Q> ALMORAN, who&s;e vanity betrayed him to flatter his own pow|er in the per&s;on of HAMET, replied with a &s;mile: <Q>I know, that ALMO|RAN, who pre&s;ides like a God in &s;i|lent
<PB N="55" REF="57">
and di&s;tant &s;tate, reveals the &s;e|crets of his will to thee; I know that thou art</Q>&mdash;'I am,' &s;aid O&s;myn, <Q>of all thou &s;ee&s;t, mo&s;t wretch|ed.</Q> At this declaration, ALMORAN turned &s;hort, and fixed his eyes upon O&s;myn with a look of &s;urprize and an|ger: <Q>Does not the favour of ALMO|RAN,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>who&s;e &s;mile is pow|er, and wealth, and honour, &s;hine upon thee?</Q> 'My lord,' &s;aid O&s;|myn, <Q>I know &s;o well the &s;everity of thy virtue, that if I &s;hould, even for thy &s;ake, become perfidious to thy brother</Q>&mdash;ALMORAN, who was unable to pre&s;erve the character of HAMET with propriety, interrupted him with a fierce and haughty tone: 'How!' &s;aid he, <Q>perfidious to
<PB N="56" REF="58">
my brother! to ALMORAN perfidi|ous!</Q></P>
<P>O&s;myn, who had now gone too far to recede, and who &s;till &s;aw before him the figure of HAMET, proceeded in his purpo&s;e: <Q>'I knew,' &s;aid he, that in thy judgment I &s;hould be condemned; and yet, the pre&s;erva|tion of life is the &s;tronge&s;t principle of nature, and the love of virtue is her proude&s;t boa&s;t.</Q> <Q>Explain thy|&s;elf,</Q> <Q>&s;aid ALMORAN, for I cannot comprehend thee.</Q> <Q>'I mean,' &s;aid O&s;myn, that he, who&s;e life depends upon the caprice of a tyrant, is like the wretch who&s;e &s;entence is already pronounced; and who, if the wind does but ru&s;h by his dungeon, ima|gines that it is the bow-&s;tring and the

I am that &s;lave; the &s;lave of a tyrant whom I hate.</Q> The confu&s;ion of ALMORAN was now too great to be concealed, and he &s;tood &s;ilent with rage, fear, and indignation. O&s;myn, &s;uppo&s;ing that his wonder &s;u&s;|pended his belief of what he had heard, confirmed his declaration by an oath.</P>
<P>Whoever thou art, to who&s;e mind ALMORAN, the mighty and the proud,

is pre&s;ent; before whom, the lord of ab&s;olute dominion &s;tands trembling and rebuked; who &s;ee&s;t the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of power by which nature is controuled, pale and &s;ilent with angui&s;h and di&s;ap|pointment: if, in the fury of thy wrath, thou ha&s;t aggravated weakne&s;s into guilt; if thou ha&s;t chilled the glow of affection, when it flu&s;hed the cheek in thy pre&s;ence, with the frown of di&s;plea|&s;ure, or repre&s;&s;ed the ardour of friend|&s;hip with indifference or neglect; now, let thy heart &s;mite thee: for, in thy folly, thou ha&s;t ca&s;t away that gem, which is the light of life; which power can never &s;eize, and which gold can never buy!</P>
<P>The tyrant fell at once from his pride, like a &s;tar from Heaven; and

O&s;myn, &s;till addre&s;&s;ing him as HA|MET, at once increa&s;ed his mi&s;ery and his fears: 'O,' &s;aid he, <Q>that the throne of Per&s;ia was thine! then &s;hould innocence enjoy her birth-right of peace, and hope &s;hould bid hone&s;t indu&s;try look upward. There is not one to whom ALMORAN has delegat|ed power, nor one on whom his tran&s;ient favour has be&s;towed any gift, who does not already feel his heart throb with the pangs of boding terror.

as did not &s;uit the character he had a&s;&s;umed; and telling O&s;myn, that he thanked him for his friend&s;hip, and would improve the advantages it offered him, he directed him to ac|quaint the eunuchs that they were to admit him to ALMEIDA.

<P>His fir&s;t thought was to put O&s;myn to death: but he con&s;idered, that by this he would gain no advantage, as he would be in equal danger from who|ever &s;hould &s;ucceed him: he con&s;i|dered al&s;o, that again&s;t O&s;myn he was upon his guard; and that he might at any time learn, from him, whatever
<PB N="62" REF="64">
de&s;ign might be formed in favour of HAMET, by a&s;&s;uming HAMET's ap|pearance: that he would thus be the confident of every &s;ecret, in which his own &s;afety was concerned; and might di&s;concert the be&s;t contrived project at the very moment of its execution, when it would be too late for other mea&s;ures to be taken: he determined, therefore, to let O&s;myn live; at lea&s;t, till it became more nece&s;&s;ary to cut him off. Having in &s;ome degree &s;oothed and fortified his mind by the&s;e reflections, he entered the apart|ment of ALMEIDA.</P>
<P>His hope was not founded upon a de&s;ign to marry her under the appear|ance of HAMET; for that would be im|po&s;&s;ible, as the ceremony mu&s;t have been performed by the prie&s;ts who &s;up|po&s;ed
<PB N="63" REF="65">
the marriage with HAMET to have been forbidden by a divine com|mand; and who, therefore, would not have con&s;ented, even &s;uppo&s;ing they would otherwi&s;e have ventured, at the reque&s;t of HAMET, to perform a cere|mony which they knew would be di&s;|plea&s;ing to ALMORAN: but he hoped to take advantage of her tenderne&s;s for his brother, and the particular circum|&s;tances of her &s;ituation, which made the &s;olemnities of mariage impo&s;&s;ible, to &s;educe her to gratify his de&s;ires, without the &s;anction which alone ren|dered the gratification of them lawful: if he &s;ucceeded in this de&s;ign, he had rea&s;on to expect, either that his love would be extingui&s;hed by enjoyment; or that, if he &s;hould &s;till de&s;ire to marry ALMEIDA, he might, by di&s;clo&s;|ing to her the artifice by which he had
<PB N="64" REF="66">
effected his purpo&s;e, prevail upon her to con&s;ent, as her connexion with HA|MET, the chief ob&s;tacle to her marriage with him, would then be broken for ever; and as &s;he might, perhaps, wi&s;h to &s;anctify the plea&s;ure which &s;he might be not unwilling to repeat, or at lea&s;t to make that lawful which it would not be in her power to prevent.</P>
<P>In this di&s;po&s;ition, and with this de|&s;ign, he was admitted to ALMEIDA; who, without &s;u&s;picion of her danger, was expo&s;ed to the &s;evere&s;t trial, in which every pa&s;&s;ion concurred to oppo&s;e her virtue: &s;he was &s;olicited by all the powers of &s;ubtilty and de&s;ire, under the appearance of a lover who&s;e ten|derne&s;s and fidelity had been long tried, and who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion &s;he returned with
<PB N="65" REF="67">
equal con&s;tancy and ardour; and &s;he was thus &s;olicited, when the rites which alone could con&s;ecrate their union, were im|po&s;&s;ible, and were rendered impo&s;&s;ible by the guilty de&s;igns of a rival, in who&s;e power &s;he was, and from whom no other expedient offered her a deliver|ance. Thus deceived and betrayed, &s;he received him with an exce&s;s of ten|derne&s;s and joy, which flattered all his hopes, and for a moment &s;u&s;pended his mi&s;ery. She enquired, with a &s;ond and gentle &s;olicitude, by what means he had gained admittance, and how he had provided for his retreat. He received and returned her care&s;&s;es with a vehemence, in which, to le&s;s partial eyes, de&s;ire would have been more ap|parent than love; and in the tumult of his pa&s;&s;ion, he almo&s;t neglected her
<PB N="66" REF="68">
enquiries: finding, however, that &s;he would be an&s;wered, he told her, that being by the permi&s;&s;ion of ALMORAN admitted to every part of the palace, except that of the women, he had found means to bribe the eunuch who kept the door; who was not in danger of detection, becau&s;e ALMORAN, wea|ried with the tumult and fatigue of the day, had retired to &s;leep, and given order to be called at a certain hour. She then complained of the &s;o|licitations to which &s;he was expo&s;ed, expre&s;&s;ed her dread of the con&s;equences &s;he had rea&s;on to expect from &s;ome &s;ud|den &s;ally of the tyrant's rage, and re|lated with tears the brutal outrage &s;he had &s;uffered when he la&s;t left her: 'Though I abhorred him,' &s;aid &s;he, <Q>I yet kneeled before him for thee.
<PB N="67" REF="69">
Let me bend in reverence to that Power, at who&s;e look the whirlwinds are &s;ilent, and the &s;eas are calm, that his fury has hitherto been re&s;trained from hurting thee!</Q></P>
<P>At the&s;e words, the face of ALMO|RAN was again covered with the blu&s;hes of confu&s;ion: to be &s;till beloved only as HAMET, and as ALMORAN to be &s;till hated; to be thus reproached with|out anger, and wounded by tho&s;e who knew not that they &s;truck him; was a &s;pecies of mi&s;ery peculiar to him&s;elf, and had been incurred only by the ac|qui&s;ition of new powers, which he had reque&s;ted and received as nece&s;&s;ary to obtain that felicity, which the par&s;i|mony of nature had placed beyond his reach. His emotions, however, as by
<PB N="68" REF="70">
ALMEIDA they were &s;uppo&s;ed to be the emotions of HAMET, &s;he imputed to a different cau&s;e: 'As Heaven,' &s;ays &s;he, <Q>has pre&s;erved thee from death; &s;o has it, for thy &s;ake, pre|&s;erved me from violation.</Q> ALMO|RAN, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion had in this inter|val again &s;urmounted his remor&s;e, gazed eagerly upon her, and catching her to his bo&s;om; 'Let us at lea&s;t,' &s;ays he, <Q>&s;ecure the happine&s;s that is now of|fered; let not the&s;e ine&s;timable mo|ments pa&s;s by us unimproved; but to &s;hew that we de&s;erve them, let them be devoted to love.</Q> <Q>Let us then,</Q> &s;aid ALMEIDA, <Q>e&s;cape toge|ther.</Q> 'To e&s;cape with thee,' &s;aid ALMORAN, <Q>is impo&s;&s;ible. I &s;hall re|tire, and, like the &s;haft of Arabia, leave no mark behind me; but the
<PB N="69" REF="71">
flight of ALMEIDA will at once be traced to him by whom I was ad|mitted, and I &s;hall thus retaliate his friend&s;hip with de&s;truction.</Q> <Q>Let him then,</Q> &s;aid ALMEIDA, <Q>be the partner of our flight.</Q> <Q>Urge it not now, &s;aid ALMORAN;</Q> <Q>but tru&s;t to my prudence and my love, to &s;elect &s;ome hour that will be more favour|able to our purpo&s;e. And yet,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>even then, we &s;hall, as now, &s;igh in vain for the completion of our wi&s;hes: by whom &s;hall our hands be joined, when in the opinion of the prie&s;ts it has been forbidden from above?</Q> 'Save thy&s;elf then,' &s;aid AL|MEIDA, 'and leave me to my fate.' 'Not &s;o,' &s;aid ALMORAN. <Q>What el&s;e,</Q> replied ALMEIDA, <Q>is in our power?</Q> 'It is in our power,' &s;aid
<PB N="70" REF="72">
ALMORAN, <Q>to &s;eize that joy, to which a public form can give us no new claim; for the public form can only declare that right by which I claim it now.</Q></P>
<P>As they were now reclining upon a &s;ofa, he threw his arm round her; but &s;he &s;uddenly &s;prung up, and bur&s;t from him: the tear &s;tarted to her eye, and &s;he gazed upon him with an earne&s;t but yet tender look: 'Is it?' &s;ays &s;he<Q>&mdash;No &s;ure, it is not the voice of HAMET!</Q> 'O! yes,' &s;aid ALMORAN, <Q>what other voice &s;hould call thee to cancel at once the wrongs of HAMET and ALMEIDA; to &s;ecure the trea&s;ures of thy love from the hand of the rob|ber; to hide the joys, which if now we lo&s;e we may lo&s;e for ever, in the
<PB N="71" REF="73">
&s;acred and inviolable &s;tores of the pa&s;t, and place them beyond the power not of ALMORAN only but of fate?</Q> With this wild effu&s;ion of de&s;ire, he caught her again to his brea&s;t, and finding no re&s;i&s;tance his heart exulted in his &s;ucce&s;s; but the next moment, to the total di&s;appointment of his hopes, he perceived that &s;he had fainted in his arms. When &s;he recovered, &s;he once more di&s;engaged her&s;elf from him, and turning away her face, &s;he bur&s;t into tears. When her voice could be heard, &s;he covered her&s;elf with her veil, and turning again towards him, <Q>All but this,</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q>I had learnt to bear; and how has this been de&s;erved by AL|MEIDA of HAMET? You was my only &s;olace in di&s;tre&s;s; and when the tears have &s;tolen from my eyes in &s;ilence
<PB N="72" REF="74">
and in &s;olitude, I thought on thee; I thought upon the cha&s;te ardour of thy &s;acred friend&s;hip, which was &s;oftened, refined, and exalted into love. This was my hoarded trea&s;ure; and the thoughts of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing this, &s;oothed all my angui&s;h with a mi&s;er's happine&s;s, who, ble&s;t in the con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s of hidden wealth, de&s;pi&s;es cold and hunger, and rejoices in the mid&s;t of all the mi&s;eries that make poverty dreadful: this was my la&s;t retreat; but I am now de&s;olate and forlorn, and my &s;oul looks round, with terror, for that refuge which it can never find.</Q> 'Find that refuge,' &s;aid ALMORAN, 'in me.' 'Alas!' &s;aid ALMEIDA, <Q>can he afford me re|fuge from my &s;orrows, who, for the guilty plea&s;ures of a tran&s;ient mo|ment,
<PB N="73" REF="75">
would for ever &s;ully the purity of my mind, and aggravate misfor|tune by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt?</Q></P>
<P>As ALMORAN now perceived, that it was impo&s;&s;ible, by any importunity, to induce her to violate her principles; he had nothing more to attempt, but to &s;ubvert them. 'When,' &s;aid he, <Q>&s;hall ALMEIDA awake, and the&s;e dreams of folly and &s;uper&s;tition va|ni&s;h? That only is virtue, by which happine&s;s is produced; and whatever produces happine&s;s, is therefore vir|tue; and the forms, and words, and rites, which prie&s;ts have pretended to be required by Heaven, are the fraudful arts only by which they go|vern mankind.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="76">
ALMEIDA, by this impious in&s;ult, was rou&s;ed from grief to indignation: 'As thou ha&s;t now dared,' &s;aid &s;he, <Q>to deride the laws, which thou would&s;t fir&s;t have broken; &s;o ha&s;t thou broken for ever the tender bonds, by which my &s;oul was united to thine. Such as I fondly believed thee, thou art not; and what thou art, I have never loved. I have loved a delu&s;ive phantom only, which, while I &s;trove to gra&s;p it, has va|ni&s;hed from me.</Q> ALMORAN attempt|ed to reply; but on &s;uch a &s;ubject, neither her virtue nor her wi&s;dom would permit debate. 'That prodigy,' &s;aid &s;he, <Q>which I thought was the &s;leight of cunning, or the work of &s;orcery, I now revere as the voice of Heaven; which, as it knew thy heart,
<PB N="75" REF="77">
has in mercy &s;aved me from thy arms. To the will of Heaven &s;hall my will be obedient; and my voice al&s;o &s;hall pronounce, to ALMORAN ALMEIDA.</Q></P>
<P>ALMORAN, who&s;e whole &s;oul was now &s;u&s;pended in attention, conceived new hopes of &s;ucce&s;s; and fore&s;aw the cer|tain accompli&s;hment of his purpo&s;e, though by an effect directly contrary to that which he had laboured to pro|duce. Thus to have incurred the ha|tred of ALMEIDA in the form of HA|MET, was more fortunate than to have taken advantage of her love; the path that led to his wi&s;hes was now clear and open; and his marriage with AL|MEIDA in his own per&s;on, waited only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ill he could re&s;ume it. He, therefore,
<PB N="76" REF="78">
in&s;tead of &s;oothing, provoked her re|&s;entment: <Q>If thou ha&s;t loved a phan|tom,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>which exi&s;ted only in imagination; on &s;uch a phantom my love al&s;o has been fixed: thou ha&s;t, indeed, only the form of what I called ALMEIDA; my love thou ha&s;t rejected, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t never loved; the object of thy pa&s;&s;ion was not HAMET, but a throne; and thou ha&s;t made the ob&s;ervance of rituals, in which folly only can &s;uppo&s;e there is good or ill, a pretence to violate thy faith, that thou may&s;t &s;till gra|tify thy ambition.</Q></P>
<P>To this injurious reproach, ALMEI|DA made no reply; and ALMORAN immediately quitted her apartment, that he might rea&s;&s;ume his own figure,
<PB N="77" REF="79">
and take advantage of the di&s;po&s;ition which, under the appearance of HA|MET, he had produced in favour of him&s;elf: But O&s;myn, who &s;uppo&s;ing him to be HAMET, had intercepted and detained him as he was going to ALMEI|DA, now intercepted him a &s;econd time at his return, having placed him&s;elf near the door of the apartment for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>O&s;myn was by no means &s;atisfied with the i&s;&s;ue of their la&s;t interview: he had perceived a perturbation in the mind of ALMORAN, for which, imagin|ing him to be HAMET, he could not ac|count; and which &s;eemed more extra|ordinary upon a review, than when it happened; he, therefore, again entered into conver&s;ation with him, in which he
<PB N="78" REF="80">
farther di&s;clo&s;ed his &s;entiments and de|&s;igns. ALMORAN, notwith&s;tanding the impatience natural to his temper and &s;ituation, was thus long detained li&s;tening to O&s;myn, by the united in|fluence of his curio&s;ity and his fears; his enquiries &s;till alarmed him with new terrors, by di&s;covering new objects of di&s;tru&s;t, and new in&s;tances of di&s;affec|tion: &s;till, however, he re&s;olved, not yet to remove O&s;myn from his po&s;t, that he might give no alarm by any appearance of &s;u&s;picion, and con&s;e|quently learn with more ea&s;e, and de|tect with more certainty, any project that might be formed again&s;t him.</P>

<P>ALMEIDA, as &s;oon as &s;he was left alone, began to review the &s;cene that had ju&s;t pa&s;t; and was every moment affected with new wonder, grief, and re&s;entment. She now de|plored her own misfortune; and now conceived a de&s;ign to puni&s;h the au|thor of it, from who&s;e face &s;he &s;up|po&s;ed the hand of adver&s;ity had torn the ma&s;k under which he had deceived her: it appeared to her very ea&s;y, to take a &s;evere revenge upon HAMET for the indignity which &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed he had offered her, by complaining of it
<PB N="80" REF="82">
to ALMORAN; and telling him, that he had gained admittance to her by brib|ing the eunuch who kept the door. The thought of thus giving him up, was one moment rejected, as ari&s;ing from a vindictive &s;pirit; and the next indulged, as an act of ju&s;tice to ALMORAN, and a puni&s;hment due to the hypocri&s;y of HAMET: to the fir&s;t &s;he inclined, when her grief, which was &s;till mingled with a tender remembrance of the man &s;he loved, was predominant; and to the la&s;t, when her grief gave way to indig|nation.</P>
<P>Thus are we inclined to con&s;ider the &s;ame action, either as a virtue, or a vice, by the influence of different pa&s;|&s;ions, which prompt us either to per|form or to avoid it. ALMEIDA, from de|liberating
<PB N="81" REF="83">
whether &s;he &s;hould accu&s;e HAMET to ALMORAN, or conceal his fault, was led to con&s;ider what puni&s;h|ment he would either incur or e&s;cape in con&s;equence of her determination; and the images that ru&s;hed into her mind, the moment this became the ob|ject of her thoughts, at once deter|mined her to be &s;ilent: <Q>Could I bear to &s;ee,</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q>that hand, which has &s;o often trembled with delight when it enfolded mine, convul&s;ed and black! tho&s;e eyes, that as often as they gazed upon me were di&s;&s;olv|ed in tears of tenderne&s;s and love, &s;tart from the &s;ockets! and tho&s;e lips that breathed the &s;ofte&s;t &s;ighs of ele|gant de&s;ire, di&s;torted and ga&s;ping in the convul&s;ions of death!</Q></P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="84">
From this image, her mind recoiled in an agony of terror and pity; her heart &s;unk within her; her limbs trem|bled; &s;he &s;unk down upon the &s;ofa, and bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>By this time, HAMET, on who&s;e form the likene&s;s of ALMORAN was &s;till impre&s;&s;ed, had reached the palace. He went in&s;tantly towards the apart|ment of the women. In&s;tead of that chearful alacrity, that mixture of zeal and reverence and affection, which his eye had been u&s;ed to find where|ever it was turned, he now ob&s;erved confu&s;ion, anxiety and terror; whoever he met, made ha&s;te to pro&s;trate them|&s;elves before him, and feared to look up till he was pa&s;t. He went on, how|ever, with a ha&s;ty pace; and coming up
<PB N="83" REF="85">
to the eunuch's guard, he &s;aid with an impatient tone; 'TO ALMEIDA.' The &s;lave immediately made way before him, and conducted him to the door of the apartment, which he would not otherwi&s;e have been able to find, and for which he could not directly en|quire.</P>
<P>When he entered, his countenance expre&s;&s;ed all the pa&s;&s;ions that his &s;itua|tion had rou&s;ed in his mind. He fir&s;t looked &s;ternly round him, to &s;ee whe|ther ALMORAN was not pre&s;ent; and then fetching a deep &s;igh he turned his eyes, with a look of mournful tender|ne&s;s, upon ALMEIDA. His fir&s;t view was to di&s;cover, whether ALMORAN had already &s;upplanted him; and for this purpo&s;e he collected the whole &s;trength
<PB N="84" REF="86">
of his mind: he con&s;idered that he ap|peared now, not as HAMET, but as ALMORAN; and that he was to que&s;|tion ALMEIDA concerning ALMORAN, while &s;he had mi&s;taken him for HA|MET; he was therefore to maintain the character, at whatever expence, till his doubts were re&s;olved, and his fears either removed or confirmed: he was &s;o firmly per&s;uaded, that ALMO|RAN had been there before him, that he did not a&s;k the que&s;tion, but &s;uppo&s;ed the fact; he re&s;trained alike both his tenderne&s;s and his fears; and looking earne&s;tly upon ALMEIDA, who had ri&s;en up in his pre&s;ence with blu&s;hes and confu&s;ion, 'To me,' &s;ays he, <Q>is ALMEIDA &s;till cold? and has &s;he la|vi&s;hed all her love upon HAMET?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="87">
At the name of HAMET, the blu&s;hes and confu&s;ion of ALMEIDA increa&s;ed: her mind was &s;till full of the images, which had ri&s;en from the thought of what HAMET might &s;uffer, if ALMO|RAN &s;hould know that he had been with her; and though &s;he feared that their interview was di&s;covered, yet &s;he hoped it might be only &s;u&s;pected, and in that ca&s;e the removal or confirma|tion of the &s;u&s;picions, on which the fate of HAMET depended, would de|volve upon her.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, &s;he, who had but a few moments before doubted, whe|ther &s;he &s;hould not voluntarily give him up, when nothing more was ne|ce&s;&s;ary for his &s;afety than to be &s;ilent; now determined, with whatever reluc|tance,
<PB N="86" REF="88">
to &s;ecure him, though it could not be done without di&s;&s;imulation, and though it was probable that in this di&s;&s;imulation &s;he would be detected. In&s;tead, therefore, of an&s;wering the que&s;tion, &s;he repeated it: <Q>On whom &s;aid my lord, on HAMET?</Q> HAMET, who&s;e &s;u&s;picions were increa&s;ed by the eva&s;ion, replied with great emotion, <Q>Aye, on HAMET; did he not this moment leave you?</Q> <Q>Leave me this moment?</Q> &s;aid ALMEIDA, with yet greater confu&s;ion, and deeper blu&s;hes. HAMET, in the impatience of his jea|lou&s;y, concluded, that the pa&s;&s;ions which he &s;aw expre&s;&s;ed in her counte|nance, and which aro&s;e from the &s;trug|gle between her regard to truth and her tenderne&s;s for HAMET, proceeded
<PB N="87" REF="89">
from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of what he had mo&s;t rea&s;on to dread, and &s;he to con|ceal, a breach of virtue, to which &s;he had been betrayed by his own ap|pearance united with the vices of his brother: he, therefore, drew back from her with a look of inexpre&s;&s;ible an|gui&s;h, and &s;tood &s;ome time &s;ilent. She ob&s;erved, that in his countenance there was more expre&s;&s;ion of trouble, than rage; &s;he, therefore, hoped to divert him from per&s;uing his enquiries, by at once removing his jealou&s;y; which &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed would be at an end, as &s;oon as &s;he &s;hould di&s;clo&s;e the re&s;olution &s;he had taken in his favour. Addre&s;&s;|ing him, therefore, as ALMORAN, with a voice which though it was gentle and &s;oothing, was yet mournful and tremu|lous; 'Do not turn from me,' &s;aid &s;he,
<Q><PB N="88" REF="90">
with tho&s;e unfriendly and frowning looks; give me now that love which &s;o lately you offered, and with all the future I will atone the pa&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>Upon HAMET, who&s;e heart involun|tarily an&s;wered to the voice of AL|MEIDA, the&s;e words had irre&s;i&s;tible and in&s;tantaneous force; but recollecting, in a moment, who&s;e from he bore, and to whom they were addre&s;&s;ed, they &s;truck him with new a&s;toni&s;hment, and increa&s;ed the torments of his mind. Suppo&s;ing what he at fir&s;t feared had happened, and that ALMORAN had &s;e|duced her as HAMET; he could not ac|count for her now addre&s;&s;ing him, as ALMORAN, with words of favour and compliance: he, therefore, renewed his enquiries concerning him&s;elf, with ap|prehen&s;ions
<PB N="89" REF="91">
of a different kind. She, who was &s;till &s;olicitous to put an end to the enquiry, as well for the &s;ake of HAMET, as to prevent her own em|barra&s;&s;ment, replied with a &s;igh, <Q>Let not thy peace be interrupted by one thought of HAMET; for of HAMET ALMEIDA &s;hall think no more.</Q> HA|MET, who, though he had fortified him&s;elf again&s;t whatever might have happened to her per&s;on, could not bear the alienation of her mind, cried out, with looks of di&s;traction and a voice &s;carcely human, <Q>Not think of HAMET!</Q> ALMEIDA, who&s;e a&s;toni&s;h|ment was every moment increa&s;ing, re|plied, with a tender and intere&s;ting en|quiry, <Q>IS ALMORAN then offended, that ALMEIDA &s;hould think of HA|MET no more?</Q> HAMET, being thus
<PB N="90" REF="92">
addre&s;&s;ed by the name of his brother, again recollected his &s;ituation; and now fir&s;t conceived the idea, that the alte|ration of ALMEIDA's &s;entiments with re&s;pect to him&s;elf, might be the effect of &s;ome violence offered her by ALMO|RAN in his likene&s;s; he, therefore, re|curred to his fir&s;t purpo&s;e, and deter|mined, by a direct enquiry, to di&s;co|ver, whether &s;he had &s;een him under that appearance. This enquiry he urged with the utmo&s;t &s;olemnity and ardour, in terms &s;uitable to his pre&s;ent appearance and &s;ituation: 'Tell me,' &s;aid he, <Q>have the&s;e doors been open to HAMET?

To this double que&s;tion, ALMEIDA an&s;wered by a &s;ingle negative; and her an&s;wer, therefore, was both fal&s;e and true: it was true that her per&s;on was &s;till inviolate, and it was true al&s;o that HAMET had not been admitted to her; yet her denial of it was fal&s;e, for &s;he believed the contrary; ALMORAN only had been admitted, but &s;he had re|ceived him as his brother. HAMET, however, was &s;atisfied with the an&s;wer, and did not di&s;cover its fallacy. He looked up to Heaven, with an expre&s;|&s;ion of gratitude and joy; and then turning to ALMEIDA, 'Swear then,' &s;aid he, <Q>that thou ha&s;t granted to HAMET, no pledge of thy love which &s;hould be re&s;erved for me.</Q> ALMEI|DA, who now thought nothing more than the a&s;&s;everation nece&s;&s;ary to quiet
<PB N="92" REF="94">
his mind, immediately complied: <Q>I &s;wear,</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q>that to HAMET I have given nothing, which thou would&s;t wi&s;h me to with-hold: the power that has devoted my per&s;on to thee, has di&s;united my heart from HAMET, whom I renounce in thy pre&s;ence for ever.</Q></P>
<P>HAMET, who&s;e fortitude and recol|lection were again overborne, was thrown into an agitation of mind, which di&s;covered it&s;elf by looks and ge&s;tures very different from tho&s;e which ALMEIDA had expected, and over|whelmed her with new confu&s;ion and di&s;appointment: that he, who had &s;o lately &s;olicited her love with all the ve|hemence of a de&s;ire impatient to be gratified, &s;hould now receive a decla|ration
<PB N="93" REF="95">
that &s;he was ready to comply, with marks of di&s;tre&s;s and anger, was a my&s;tery which &s;he could not &s;olve. In the mean time, the &s;truggle in his brea&s;t became every moment more violent: 'Where then,' &s;aid he, <Q>is the con|&s;tancy which you vowed to HAMET; and for what in&s;tance of his love is he now for&s;aken?</Q></P>
<P>ALMEIDA was now more embarra&s;|&s;ed than before; &s;he felt all the force of the reproof, &s;uppo&s;ing it to have been given by ALMORAN; and &s;he could be ju&s;tified only by relating the particular, which at the expence of her &s;incerity &s;he had determined to conceal. AL|MORAN was now exalted in her opi|nion, while his form was animated by the &s;pirit of HAMET; as much as
<PB N="94" REF="96">
HAMET had been degraded, while his form was animated by the &s;pirit of ALMORAN. In his re&s;entment of her perfidy to his rival, though it favoured his fonde&s;t and mo&s;t ardent wi&s;hes, there was an abhorrence of vice, and a ge|nero&s;ity of mind, which &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed to have been incompatible with his character. To his reproach, &s;he could reply only by complaint; and could no otherwi&s;e evade his que&s;tion, than by ob&s;erving the incon&s;i&s;tency of his own behaviour: 'Your words,' &s;aid &s;he, <Q>are daggers to my heart. You condemn me for a compliance with your own wi&s;hes; and for obedience to that voice, which you &s;uppo&s;ed to have revealed the will of Heaven. Has the caprice of de&s;ire already wander|ed to a new object? and do you
<PB N="95" REF="97">
now &s;eek a pretence to refu&s;e, when it is freely offered, what &s;o lately you would have taken by force?</Q></P>
<P>HAMET, who was now fired with re|&s;entment again&s;t ALMEIDA, whom yet he could not behold without de&s;ire; and who, at the &s;ame moment, was impatient to revenge his wrongs upon ALMORAN; was &s;uddenly prompted to &s;atisfy all his pa&s;&s;ions, by taking ad|vantage of the wiles of ALMORAN, and the perfidy of ALMEIDA, to defeat the one and to puni&s;h the other. It was now in his power in&s;tantly to con|&s;ummate his marriage, as a prie&s;t might be procured without a moment's delay, and as ALMEIDA's con&s;ent was already given; he would then obtain the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of her per&s;on, by the very act
<PB N="96" REF="98">
in which &s;he perfidiou&s;ly re&s;igned it to his rival; to whom he would then leave the beauties he had already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and ca&s;t from him in di&s;dain, as united with a mind that he could never love. As his imagination was fired with the fir&s;t conception of this de&s;ign, he caught her to his brea&s;t with a fury, in which all the pa&s;&s;ions in all their rage were at once concentered: <Q>Let the prie&s;t,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>in&s;tantly unite us. Let us comprize, in one mo|ment, in this in&s;tant, NOW, our whole of being, and exclude alike the fu|ture and the pa&s;t!</Q> Then gra&s;ping her &s;till in his arms, he looked up to heaven: 'Ye powers,' &s;aid he, <Q>in|vi&s;ible but yet pre&s;ent, who mould my changing and unre&s;i&s;ting form; prolong, but for one hour, that
<PB N="97" REF="99">
my&s;terious charm, that is now upon me, and I will be ever after &s;ub&s;er|vient to your will!</Q></P>
<P>ALMEIDA, who was terrified at the furious ardor of this unintelligible ad|dre&s;s, &s;hrunk from his embrace, pale and trembling, without power to re|ply. HAMET gazed tenderly upon her; and recollecting the purity and tenderne&s;s with which he had loved her, his virtues &s;uddenly recovered their force; he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her from his em|brace; and turning from her, he dropped in &s;ilence the tear that &s;tarted to his eye, and expre&s;&s;ed, in a low and faultering voice, the thoughts that ru&s;h|ed upon his mind: 'No,' &s;aid he; <Q>HAMET &s;hall &s;till di&s;dain the joy, which is at once &s;ordid and tran&s;ient:
<PB N="98" REF="100">
in the brea&s;t of HAMET, lu&s;t &s;hall not be the pander of revenge. Shall I, who have langui&s;hed for the pure delight which can ari&s;e only from the interchange of &s;oul with &s;oul, and is endeared by mutual confi|dence and complacency; &s;hall I &s;natch under this di&s;gui&s;e, which belies my features and degrades my virtue, a ca&s;ual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of faithle&s;s beauty, which I de&s;pi&s;e and hate? Let this be the portion of tho&s;e, that hate me without a cau&s;e; but let this be far from me!</Q> At this thought, he felt a &s;udden elation of mind; and the con&s;cious dignity of virtue, that in &s;uch a conflict was victorious, render|ed him, in this glorious moment, &s;upe|rior to misfortune: his ge&s;ture became calm, and his countenance &s;edate; he
<PB N="99" REF="101">
con&s;idered the wrongs he &s;uffered, not as a &s;ufferer, but as a judge; and he determined at once to di&s;cover him&s;elf to ALMEIDA, and to reproach her with her crime. He remarked her confu|&s;ion without pity, as the effect not of grief but of guilt; and fixing his eyes upon her, with the calm &s;everity of a &s;uperior and offended being, 'Such,' &s;aid he, <Q>is the benevolence of the Almighty to the children of the du&s;t, that our misfortunes are, like poi|&s;ons, antidotes to each other.</Q></P>
<P>ALMEIDA, who&s;e faculties were now &s;u&s;pended by wonder and expectation, looked earne&s;tly at him, but continued &s;ilent. 'Thy looks,' &s;aid HAMET, <Q>are full of wonder; but as yet thy wonder has no cau&s;e, in compari&s;on
<PB N="100" REF="102">
of that which &s;hall be revealed. Thou knowe&s;t the prodigy, which &s;o lately parted HAMET and ALMEIDA: I am that HAMET, thou art that ALMEI|DA.</Q> ALMEIDA would now have in|terrupted him; but HAMET rai&s;ed his voice, and demanded to be heard: <Q>At that moment,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>wretched as I am, the child of error and di&s;|obedience, my heart repined in &s;ecret at the de&s;tiny which had been written upon my head; for I then thought thee faithful and con&s;tant: but if our hands had been then united, I &s;hould have been more wretched than I am; for I now know that thou art fickle and fal&s;e. To know thee, though it has pierced my &s;oul with &s;orrow, has yet healed the wound which was inflicted when I lo&s;t thee:
<PB N="101" REF="103">
and though I am now compelled to wear the form of ALMORAN, who&s;e vices are this moment di&s;gracing mine, yet in the balance I &s;hall be weighed as HAMET, and I &s;hall &s;uffer only as I am found wanting.</Q></P>
<P>ALMEIDA, who&s;e mind was now in a tumult that bordered upon di&s;trac|tion, bewildered in a labyrinth of doubt and wonder, and alike dreading the con&s;equence of what &s;he heard, whe|ther it was fal&s;e or true, was yet impa|tient to confute or confirm it; and as &s;oon as &s;he had recovered her &s;peech, urged him for &s;ome token of the pro|digy he a&s;&s;erted, which he might ea&s;ily have given, by relating any of the in|cidents which them&s;elves only could know. But ju&s;t at this moment, AL|MORAN,
<PB N="102" REF="104">
having at la&s;t di&s;engaged him|&s;elf from O&s;myn, by whom he had been long detained, re&s;umed his own figure: and while the eyes of ALMEI|DA were fixed upon HAMET, his powers were &s;uddenly taken from him, and re|&s;tored in an in&s;tant; and &s;he beheld the features of ALMORAN vani&s;h, and gazed with a&s;toni&s;hment upon his own: 'Thy features change!' &s;aid &s;he, <Q>and thou indeed art HAMET.</Q> <Q>The &s;ud|den trance,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>has re&s;tored me to my&s;elf; and from my wrongs where &s;halt thou be hidden?</Q> This reproach was more than &s;he could &s;u&s;|tain; but he caught her as &s;he was fal|ling, and &s;upported her in his arms. This incident renewed in a moment all the tenderne&s;s of his love: while he beheld her di&s;tre&s;s, and pre&s;&s;ed her by
<PB N="103" REF="105">
the embrace that &s;u&s;tained her to his bo&s;om, he forgot every injury which he &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he had done him; and per|ceived her recover with a plea&s;ure, that for a moment &s;u&s;pended the &s;en&s;e of his misfortunes.</P>
<P>Her fir&s;t reflection was upon the &s;nare, in which &s;he had been taken; and her fir&s;t &s;en&s;ation was joy that &s;he had e&s;caped: &s;he &s;aw at once the whole complication of events that had de|ceived and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed her; and nothing more was now nece&s;&s;ary, than to ex|plain them to HAMET; which, how|ever, &s;he could not do, without di&s;co|vering the in&s;incerity of her an&s;wers to the enquiries which he had made, while &s;he mi&s;took him for his brother: <Q>If in my heart,</Q> &s;ays &s;he, <Q>thou ha&s;t
<PB N="104" REF="106">
found any virtue, let it incline thee to pity the vice that is mingled with it: by the vice I have been en&s;nared, but I have been delivered by the vir|tue. ALMORAN, for now I know that it was not thee, ALMORAN, when he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed thy form, was with me: he prophaned thy love, by at|tempts to &s;upplant my virtue; I re|&s;i&s;ted his importunity, and e&s;caped perdition; but the guilt of ALMO|RAN drew my re&s;entment upon HA|MET. I thought the vices which, under thy form, I di&s;covered in his bo&s;om, were thine; and in the an|gui&s;h of grief, indignation, and di&s;|appointment, my heart renounced thee: yet, as I could not give thee up to death, I could not di&s;cover to ALMORAN the attempt which I im|puted
<PB N="105" REF="107">
to thee; when you que&s;tioned me, therefore, as ALMORAN, I was betrayed to di&s;&s;imulation, by the ten|derne&s;s which &s;till melted my heart for HAMET.</Q> 'I believe thee,' &s;aid HAMET, catching her in a tran&s;port to his brea&s;t: <Q>I love thee for thy vir|tue; and may the pure and exalted beings, who are &s;uperior to the pa&s;|&s;ions that now throb in my heart, forgive me, if I love thee al&s;o for thy fault. Yet, let the danger to which it betrayed thee, teach us &s;till to walk in the &s;trait path, and com|mit the keeping of our peace to the Almighty; for he that wanders in the maze of fal&s;ehood, &s;hall pa&s;s by the good that he would meet, and &s;hall meet the evil that he would &s;hun.

<P>BUT while ALMEIDA and HAMET were thus congratulating each o|ther upon the evils which they had e&s;caped, they were threatened by o|thers, which, however obvious, they had overlooked.</P>
<P>ALMORAN, who was now exulting in the pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s that had ex|ceeded his hopes, and who &s;uppo&s;ed the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of ALMEIDA before the end of the next hour, was as certain as that the next hour would arrive, &s;uddenly entered the apartment; but upon di&s;covering HAMET, he &s;tarted

By tho&s;e arts in which thy vices have employed the powers of darkne&s;s, I have been brought hither; and by tho&s;e arts I have gained admittance: thy form which they have impo&s;ed upon me, was my pa&s;&s;port; and by the re&s;tora|tion of my own, I have detected and di&s;appointed the fraud, which the double change was produced to exe|cute.
<PB N="109" REF="111">
ALMEIDA, whom, as HA|MET, thou could&s;t teach to hate thee, it is now impo&s;&s;ible that, as ALMO|RAN, thou &s;hould&s;t teach to love.</Q></P>
<P>ALMEIDA, who perceived the &s;torm to be gathering which the next mo|ment would bur&s;t upon the head of HAMET, interpo&s;ed between them, and addre&s;&s;ed each of them by turns; urg|ing HAMET to be &s;ilent, and conjuring ALMORAN to be merciful. AL|MORAN, however, without regarding ALMEIDA, or making any reply to HAMET, &s;truck the ground with his foot, and the me&s;&s;engers of death, to whom the &s;ignal was familiar, appeared at the door. ALMORAN then com|manded them to &s;eize his brother, with a countenance pale and livid, and a
<PB N="110" REF="112">
voice that was broken by rage. HA|MET was &s;till unmoved; but ALMEI|DA threw her&s;elf at the feet of ALMO|RAN, and embracing his knees was about to &s;peak, but he broke from her with &s;udden fury: <Q>If the world &s;hould &s;ue,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>I would &s;purn it off. There is no pang that cunning can invent, which he &s;hall not &s;uffer: and when death at length &s;hall di&s;ap|point my vengeance, his mangled limbs &s;hall be ca&s;t out unburied, to feed the bea&s;ts of the de&s;ert and the fowls of heaven.</Q> During this me|nace, ALMEIDA &s;unk down without &s;igns of life; and HAMET &s;truggling in vain for liberty to rai&s;e her from the ground, &s;he was carried off by &s;ome women who were called to her a&s;|&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="113">
In this awful cri&s;is, HAMET, who felt his own fortitude give way, look|ed up; and though he conceived no words, a prayer a&s;cended from his heart to heaven, and was accepted by Him, to whom our thoughts are known while they are yet afar off. For HAMET, the fountain of &s;trength was opened from above; his eye &s;parkled with confidence, and his brea&s;t was di|lated by hope. He commanded the guard that were leading him away to &s;top, and they implicitly obeyed; he then &s;tretched out his hand towards ALMORAN, who&s;e &s;pirit was rebuked before him: 'Hear me,' &s;aid he, <Q>thou tyrant! for it is thy genius that &s;peaks by my voice.

derived from undivided empire? what joy from the prohibition of my mar|riage with ALMEIDA? what good from that power, which &s;ome evil daemon has added to thy own? what, at this moment, is thy portion, but rage and angui&s;h, di&s;appointment, and de&s;pair? Even I, whom thou &s;ee&s;t the captive of thy power, whom thou ha&s;t wronged of empire, and yet more of love; even I am happy, in compari&s;on of thee.

<P>As the words of HAMET &s;truck AL|MORAN with terror, and over-awed him by an influence which he could not &s;ur|mount;
<PB N="114" REF="116">
HAMET was forced from his pre&s;ence, before any other orders had been given about him, than were im|plied in the menace that was addre&s;&s;ed to ALMEIDA: no violence, therefore, was yet offered him; but he was &s;e|cured, till the king's plea&s;ure &s;hould be known, in a dungeon not far from the palace, to which he was conducted by a &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age; and the door being clo&s;ed upon him, he was left in &s;ilence, darkne&s;s, and &s;olitude, &s;uch as may be imagined before the voice of the Almighty produced light and life.</P>
<P>When ALMORAN was &s;ufficiently re|collected to con&s;ider his &s;ituation, he de&s;paired of prevailing upon ALMEIDA to gratify his wi&s;hes, till her attach|ment to HAMET was irreparably bro|ken;

errand?</Q> 'Who,' replied the Genius, <Q>but thy&s;elf? Ha&s;t thou not the power to a&s;&s;ume the form of whom&s;oever thou would&s;t have &s;ent?</Q> <Q>I would have &s;ent O&s;myn,</Q> &s;aid ALMORAN, <Q>but that I know him to be a traitor.</Q> 'Let the form of O&s;myn then,' &s;aid the Genius, <Q>be thine.

from the moment that ALMORAN was e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the throne, to find &s;ome opportunity &s;ecretly to de&s;troy O&s;myn: in this re&s;olution, he was con|firmed by the enmity, which inferior minds never fail to conceive again&s;t that merit, which they cannot but en|vy without &s;pirit to emulate, and by which they feel them&s;elves di&s;graced without an effort to acquire equal ho|nour; it was confirmed al&s;o by the hope which Caled had conceived, that, upon the death of O&s;myn, he &s;hould &s;ucceed to his po&s;t: his apprehen&s;ions likewi&s;e were increa&s;ed, by the gloom which he remarked in the countenance of O&s;myn; and which not knowing that it aro&s;e from fear, he imputed to jea|lou&s;y and malevolence.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="125">
When ALMORAN, who had now a&s;|&s;umed the appearance of O&s;myn, had pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ubterranean avenue to the dungeon in which HAMET was confined, he was met by Caled; of whom he de|manded admittance to the prince, and produced his own &s;ignet, as a te&s;timony that he came with the authority of the king. As it was Caled's intere&s;t to &s;ecure the favour of O&s;myn till an op|portunity &s;hould offer to cut him off, he received him with every po&s;&s;ible mark of re&s;pect and reverence; and when he was gone into the dungeon, he commanded a beverage to be pre|pared for him again&s;t he &s;hould return, in which &s;uch &s;pices were infu&s;ed, as might expel the malignity which, in that place, might be received with the breath of life; and taking him&s;elf the
<PB N="124" REF="126">
key of the pri&s;on, he waited at the door.</P>
<P>When ALMORAN entered the dun|geon, with a lamp which he had re|ceived from Caled, he found HAMET &s;itting upon the ground: his counte|nance was impre&s;&s;ed with the charac|ters of grief; but it retained no marks either of anger or fear. When he looked up, and &s;aw the features of O&s;myn, he judged that the mutes were behind him; and, therefore, ro&s;e up, to prepare him&s;elf for death. ALMO|RAN beheld his calmne&s;s and fortitude with the involuntary prai&s;e of admira|tion; yet per&s;i&s;ted in his purpo&s;e with|out remor&s;e. 'I am come,' &s;aid he, <Q>by the command of ALMORAN, to denounce that fate, the bitterne&s;s of
<PB N="125" REF="127">
which I will enable thee to avoid.</Q> And what is there,' &s;aid HAMET, <Q>in my fortunes, that has prompted thee to the danger of this attempt?</Q> <Q>The utmo&s;t that I can give thee,</Q> &s;aid ALMORAN, <Q>I can give thee with|out danger to my&s;elf: but though I have been placed, by the hand of for|tune, near the per&s;on of the tyrant, yet has my heart in &s;ecret been thy friend. If I am the me&s;&s;enger of evil, impute it to him only by whom it is devi&s;ed. The rack is now pre|paring to receive thee; and every art of ingenious cruelty will be ex|hau&s;ted to protract and to increa&s;e the agonies of death.</Q> 'And what,' &s;aid HAMET, <Q>can thy friend&s;hip offer me?</Q> 'I can offer thee,' &s;aid ALMO|RAN, <Q>that which will at once di&s;mi&s;s
<PB N="126" REF="128">
thee to tho&s;e regions, where the wick|ed cea&s;e from troubling, and the weary re&s;t for ever.</Q> He then pro|duced the poignard from his bo&s;om; and pre&s;enting it to HAMET, <Q>Take this, &s;aid he, 'and &s;leep in peace.'</Q></P>
<P>HAMET, who&s;e heart was touched with &s;udden joy at the &s;ight of &s;o un|expected a remedy for every evil, did not immediately reflect, that he was not at liberty to apply it: he &s;natched it in a tran&s;port from the hand of AL|MORAN, and expre&s;&s;ed his &s;en&s;e of the obligation by cla&s;ping him in his arms, and &s;hedding the tears of gratitude in his brea&s;t. 'Be quick,' &s;aid ALMORAN: <Q>this moment I mu&s;t leave thee; and in the next, perhaps, the me&s;&s;engers of de&s;truction may bind thee to the
<PB N="127" REF="129">
rack.</Q> 'I will be quick,' &s;aid HA|MET; <Q>and the &s;igh that &s;hall la&s;t linger upon my lips, &s;hall ble&s;s thee.</Q> They then bid each other farewel: ALMORAN retired from the dungeon, and the door was again clo&s;ed upon HAMET.</P>
<P>Caled, who waited at the door till the &s;uppo&s;ed O&s;myn &s;hould return, pre&s;ented him with the beverage which he had prepared, of which he recounted the virtues; and ALMORAN received it with plea&s;ure, and having eagerly drank it off, returned to the palace. As &s;oon as he was alone, he re&s;umed his own figure, and &s;ate, with a confident and impatient expectation, that in a &s;hort time a me&s;&s;enger would be di&s;|patched to acquaint him with the death
<PB N="128" REF="130">
of HAMET. HAMET, in the mean time, having gra&s;ped the dagger in his hand, and rai&s;ed his arm for the blow, 'This,' &s;aid he, <Q>is my pa&s;&s;port to the realms of peace, the immediate and only object of my hope!</Q> But at the&s;e words, his mind in&s;tantly took the alarm: 'Let me reflect,' &s;aid he, <Q>a moment: from what can I derive hope in death?&mdash;from that patient and per&s;evering virtue, and from that alone, by which we fulfill the ta&s;k that is a&s;&s;igned us upon the earth. Is it not our duty, to &s;uffer, as well as to act? If my own hand con&s;igns me to the grave, what can it do but perpetuate that mi&s;ery, which, by di&s;obedience, I would &s;hun? what can it do, but cut off my life and hope together?</Q> With this reflec|tion
<PB N="129" REF="131">
he threw the dagger from him; and &s;tretching him&s;elf again upon the ground, re&s;igned him&s;elf to the di&s;po|&s;al of the Father of man, mo&s;t Merci|ful and Almighty.</P>
<P>ALMORAN, who had now re&s;olved to &s;end for the intelligence which he long|ed to hear, was di&s;patching a me&s;&s;en|ger to the pri&s;on, when he was told that Caled de&s;ired admittance to his pre&s;ence. At the name of Caled, he &s;tarted up in an exta&s;y of joy; and not doubting but that HAMET was dead, he ordered him to be in&s;tantly admitted. When he came in, ALMO|RAN made no enquiry about HAMET, becau&s;e he would not appear to expect the event, which yet he &s;uppo&s;ed he had brought about; he, therefore,
<PB N="130" REF="132">
a&s;ked him only upon what bu&s;ine&s;s he came. 'I come, my lord,' &s;aid he, <Q>to apprize thee of the treachery of O&s;|myn.</Q> 'I know,' &s;aid ALMORAN, <Q>that O&s;myn is a traitor; but of what do&s;t thou accu&s;e him?</Q> 'As I was but now,' &s;aid he, <Q>changing the guard which is &s;et upon HAMET, O&s;myn came up to the door of the pri&s;on, and producing the royal &s;ig|net demanded admittance. As the command which I received, when he was delivered to my cu&s;tody, was ab|&s;olute, that no foot &s;hould enter, I doubted whether the token had not been obtained, by fraud, for &s;ome other purpo&s;e; yet, as he required ad|mittance only, I complied: but that if any treachery had been contrived, I might detect it; and that no arti|fice
<PB N="131" REF="133">
might be practi&s;ed to favour an e&s;cape; I waited my&s;elf at the door, and li&s;tening to their di&s;cour&s;e I over-heard the trea&s;on that I &s;u&s;pected.</Q> 'What then,' &s;aid ALMORAN, <Q>did&s;t thou hear?</Q> A part of what was &s;aid,' replied Caled, <Q>e&s;caped me: but I heard O&s;myn, like a perfidious and pre&s;umptuous &s;lave, call ALMORAN a tyrant; I heard him profe&s;s an in|violable friend&s;hip for HAMET, and a&s;&s;ure him of deliverance. What were the means, I know not; but he talked of &s;peed, and &s;uppo&s;ed that the effect was certain.</Q></P>
<P>ALMORAN, though he was &s;till im|patient to hear of HAMET; and di&s;co|vered, that if he was dead, his death was unknown to Caled; was yet
<PB N="132" REF="134">
notwith&s;tanding rejoiced at what he heard: and as he knew what Caled told him to be true, as the conver&s;ation he related had pa&s;&s;ed between him&s;elf and HAMET, he exulted in the plea&s;|ing confidence that he had yet a friend; the glooms of &s;u&s;picion, which had in|volved his mind, were di&s;&s;ipated, and his countenance brightened with com|placency and joy. He had delayed to put O&s;myn to death, only becau&s;e he could appoint no man to &s;ucceed him, of whom his fears did not render him equally &s;u&s;picious: but having now found, in Caled, a friend, who&s;e fide|lity had been approved when there had been no intention to try it; and being impatient to reward his zeal, and to inve&s;t his fidelity with that power, which would render his &s;ervices mo&s;t
<PB N="133" REF="135">
important; he took a ring from his own finger, and putting it upon that of Caled, 'Take this,' &s;aid he, <Q>as a pledge, that to-morrow O&s;myn &s;hall lo&s;e his head; and that, from this moment, thou art inve&s;ted with his power.</Q></P>
<P>Caled having, in the conver&s;ation between ALMORAN and HAMET, di&s;|cerned indubitable treachery, which he imputed to O&s;myn who&s;e appearance AL|MORAN had then a&s;&s;umed, eagerly &s;eized the opportunity to de&s;troy him; he, therefore, not tru&s;ting to the event of his accu&s;ation, had mingled poi&s;on in the bowl which he pre&s;ented to ALMO|RAN when he came out from HAMET: this, however, at fir&s;t he had re&s;olved to conceal.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="136">
In con&s;equence of his accu&s;ation, he &s;uppo&s;ed O&s;myn would be que&s;tioned upon the rack; he &s;uppo&s;ed al&s;o, that the accu&s;ation, as it was true, would be confirmed by his confe&s;&s;ion; that what ever he &s;hould then &s;ay to the preju|dice of his accu&s;er, would be di&s;be|lieved; and that when after a few hours the poi&s;on &s;hould take effect, no inqui&s;ition would be made into the death of a criminal, whom the bow|&s;tring or the &s;cimitar would otherwi&s;e have been employed to de&s;troy. But he now hoped to derive new merit from an act of zeal, which ALMORAN had approved before it was known, by condemning his rival to die, who&s;e death he had already in&s;ured: <Q>May the wi&s;hes of my lord,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>be always anticipated; and may it be
<PB N="135" REF="137">
found, that whatever he ordains is already done: may he accept the zeal of his &s;ervant, whom he has delight|ed to honour; for, before the light of the morning &s;hall return, the eyes of O&s;myn &s;hall clo&s;e in everla&s;ting darkne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>At the&s;e words, the countenance of ALMORAN changed; his cheeks be|came pale, and his lips trembled: 'What then,' &s;aid he, <Q>ha&s;t thou done?</Q> Caled, who was terrified and a&s;toni&s;hed, threw him&s;elf upon the ground, and was unable to reply. AL|MORAN, who now, by the utmo&s;t ef|fort of his mind, re&s;trained his confu|&s;ion and his fear, that he might learn the truth from Caled without di&s;&s;imu|lation or di&s;gui&s;e, rai&s;ed him from the
<PB N="136" REF="138">
ground and repeated his enquiry. <Q>If I have erred,</Q> &s;aid Caled, <Q>impute it not: when I had detected the trea|chery of O&s;myn, I was tran&s;ported by my zeal for thee. For proof that he is guilty, I appeal now to him&s;elf; for he yet lives: but that he might not e&s;cape the hand of ju&s;tice, I mingled, in the bowl I gave him, the drugs of death.</Q></P>
<P>At the&s;e words, ALMORAN, &s;trik|ing his hands together, looked up|ward in an agony of de&s;pair and hor|ror, and fell back upon a &s;ofa that was behind him. Caled, who&s;e a&s;toni&s;h|ment was equal to his di&s;appointment and his fears, approached him with a trembling though ha&s;ty pace; but as he &s;tooped to &s;upport him, ALMO|RAN
<PB N="137" REF="139">
&s;uddenly drew his dagger and &s;tabbed him to the heart; and repeat|ed the blow with reproaches and exe|crations, till his &s;trength failed him.</P>
<P>In this dreadful moment, the Genius once more appeared before him; at the &s;ight of whom he waved his hand, but was unable to &s;peak. 'Nothing,' &s;aid the Genius, <Q>that has happened to AL|MORAN, is hidden from me. Thy peace has been de&s;troyed alike by the defection of O&s;myn, and by the zeal of Caled: thy life may yet be pre&s;erved; but it can be pre&s;erved only by a charm, which HAMET mu&s;t apply.</Q> ALMORAN, who had rai&s;ed his eyes, and conceived &s;ome languid hope, when he heard that he might yet
<PB N="138" REF="140">
live; ca&s;t them again down in de&s;pair, when he heard that he could receive life only from HAMET. <Q>From HA|MET,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>I have already taken the power to &s;ave me; I have, by thy coun&s;el, given him the in&s;tru|ment of death, which, by thy coun|&s;el al&s;o, I urged him to u&s;e: he re|ceived it with joy, and he is now doubtle&s;s numbered with the dead.</Q> HAMET,' &s;aid the Genius, <Q>is not dead; but from the fountain of vir|tue he drinks life and peace. If what I &s;hall propo&s;e, he refu&s;es to per|form, not all the powers of earth, and &s;ea, and air, if they &s;hould com|bine, can give thee life: but if he complies, the death, that is now &s;u&s;|pended over thee, &s;hall fall upon his head; and thy life &s;hall be again de|livered
<PB N="139" REF="141">
to the hand of time.</Q> <Q>Make ha&s;te then,</Q> &s;aid ALMORAN, <Q>and I will here wait the event.</Q> <Q>The event,</Q> &s;aid the Genius, <Q>is not di&s;|&s;tant; and it is the la&s;t experiment which my power can make, either upon him or thee: when the &s;tar of the night, that is now near the ho|rizon, &s;hall &s;et, I will be with him.</Q></P>
<P>When ALMORAN was alone, he re|flected, that every act of &s;upernatural power which the Genius had enabled him to perform, had brought upon him &s;ome new calamity, though it always promi&s;ed him &s;ome new advantage. As he would not impute this di&s;appoint|ment to the purpo&s;es for which he em|ployed the power that he had received, he indulged a &s;u&s;picion, that it pro|ceeded
<PB N="140" REF="142">
from the perfidy of the Being by whom it was be&s;towed; in his mind, therefore, he thus rea&s;oned with him|&s;elf: <Q>The Genius, who has pretend|ed to be the friend of ALMORAN, has been &s;ecretly in confederacy with HAMET: why el&s;e do I yet &s;igh in vain for ALMEIDA? and why el&s;e did not HAMET peri&s;h, when his life was in my power? By his coun&s;el, I per|&s;uaded HAMET to de&s;troy him&s;elf; and, in the very act, I was betrayed to drink the potion, by which I &s;hall be de&s;troyed: I have been led on, from mi&s;ery to mi&s;ery, by ineffectual expedients, and fallacious hopes. In this cri&s;is of my fate, I will not tru&s;t, with implicit confidence, in another: I will be pre&s;ent at the interview of this powerful, but &s;u&s;pected Being,
<PB N="141" REF="143">
with HAMET; and who can tell, but that if I detect a fraud, I may be able to di&s;appoint it: however pow|erful, he is not omni&s;cient; I may, therefore, be pre&s;ent, unknown and un&s;u&s;pected even by him, in a form that I can chu&s;e by a thought, to which he cannot be con&s;cious.</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX.</HEAD>
<P>IN con&s;equence of this re&s;olution, ALMORAN, having commanded one of the &s;oldiers of the guard that attended upon HAMET into an inner room of the palace, he ordered him to wait there till his return: then mak|ing fa&s;t the door, he a&s;&s;umed his fi|gure, and went immediately to the dungeon; where producing his &s;ignet, he &s;aid, he had received orders from the king to remain with the pri&s;oner, till the watch expired.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="145">
As he entered without &s;peaking, and without a light, HAMET continued &s;tretched upon the ground, with his face towards the earth; and ALMO|RAN, having &s;ilently retired to a re|mote corner of the place, waited for the appearance of the Genius.</P>
<P>The dawn of the morning now broke; and, in a few minutes, the pri&s;on &s;hook, and the Genius appeared. He was vi&s;ible by a lambent light that played around him; and HAMET &s;tart|ing from the ground, turned to the vi|&s;ion with reverence and wonder: but as the Omnipotent was ever pre&s;ent to his mind, to whom all beings in all worlds are obedient, and on whom alone he relied for protection, he was neither confu&s;ed nor afraid. 'HAMET,' &s;aid
<PB N="144" REF="146">
the Genius, <Q>the cri&s;is of thy fate is near.</Q> 'Who art thou,' &s;aid HAMET, <Q>and for what purpo&s;e art thou come?</Q> 'I am,' replied the Genius, <Q>an inha|bitant of the world above thee; and to the will of thy brother, my pow|ers have been obedient: upon him they have not conferred happine&s;s, but they have brought evil upon thee. It was my voice, that forbad thy mar|riage with ALMEIDA; and my voice, that decreed the throne to ALMO|RAN: I gave him the power to a&s;|&s;ume thy form; and, by me, the hand of oppre&s;&s;ion is now heavy upon thee. Yet I have not decreed, that he &s;hould be happy, nor that thou &s;hould&s;t be wretched: darkne&s;s as yet re&s;ts upon my purpo&s;e; but my heart in &s;ecret is thy friend.</Q> <Q>If
<PB N="145" REF="147">
thou art, indeed my friend,</Q> &s;aid HAMET, <Q>deliver me from this pri&s;on; and pre&s;erve HAMET for ALMEIDA.</Q> 'Thy deliverance,' &s;aid the Genius, <Q>mu&s;t depend upon thy&s;elf. There is a charm, of which the power is great; but it is by thy will only, that this power can be exerted.</Q></P>
<P>The Genius then held out towards him a &s;croll, on which the &s;eal of &s;e|ven powers was impre&s;&s;ed. 'Take,' &s;aid he, <Q>this &s;croll, in which the my&s;|terious name of Oro&s;mades is writ|ten. Invoke the &s;pirits, that re&s;ide we&s;tward from the ri&s;ing of the &s;un; and northward, in the regions of cold and darkne&s;s: then &s;tretch out thy hand, and a lamp of &s;ulphur, &s;elf kindled, &s;hall burn before thee. In the fire of this lamp, con&s;ume that
<PB N="146" REF="148">
which I now give thee; and as the &s;moke, into which it changes, &s;hall mix with the air, a mighty charm &s;hall be formed, which &s;hall defend thee from all mi&s;chief: from that in&s;tant, no poi&s;on, however potent, can hurt thee; nor &s;hall any pri|&s;on confine: in one moment, thou &s;halt be re&s;tored to the throne, and to ALMEIDA; and the Angel of death, &s;hall lay his hand upon thy brother; to whom, if I had confided this la&s;t be&s;t effort of my power, he would have &s;e|cured the good to him&s;elf, and have transferred the evil to thee.</Q></P>
<P>ALMORAN, who had li&s;tened un&s;een to this addre&s;s of the Genius to HA|MET, was now confirmed in his &s;u&s;pici|ons, that evil had been ultimately in|tended again&s;t him; and that he had
<PB N="147" REF="149">
been entangled in the toils of perfidy, while he believed him&s;elf to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the efforts of friend&s;hip: he was al&s;o convinced, that by the Genius he was not known to be pre&s;ent. HAMET, however, &s;tood &s;till doubtful, and AL|MORAN was kept &s;ilent by his fears. 'Whoever thou art,' &s;aid HAMET, <Q>the condition of the advantages which thou ha&s;t offered me, is &s;uch as it is not lawful to fulfill: the&s;e horrid rites, and this commerce with unholy powers, are prohibited to mortals in the Law of life.</Q> 'See thou to that,' &s;aid the Genius: <Q>Good and evil are before thee; that which I now offer thee, I will offer no more.</Q></P>
<P>HAMET, who had not fortitude to give up at once the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;e|curing
<PB N="148" REF="150">
the advantages that had been of|fered, and who was &s;educed by human frailty to deliberate at lea&s;t upon the choice; &s;tretched out his hand, and re|ceiving the &s;croll, the Genius in&s;tantly di&s;appeared. That which had been propo&s;ed as a trial of his virtue, AL|MORAN believed indeed to be an offer of advantage; he had no hope, there|fore, but that HAMET would refu&s;e the conditions, and that he &s;hould be able to obtain the tali&s;man, and fulfill them him&s;elf: he judged that the mind of HAMET was in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and was doubtful to which &s;ide it might finally incline; he, therefore, in&s;tantly a&s;&s;umed the voice and the per&s;on of OMAR, that by the influence of his council he might be able to turn the &s;cale.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="151">
When the change was effected, he called HAMET by his name; and HA|MET, who knew the voice, an&s;wered him in a tran&s;port of joy and wonder: 'My friend,' &s;aid he, <Q>my father! in this dreary &s;olitude, in this hour of trial, thou art welcome to my &s;oul as liberty and life! Guide me to thee by thy voice; and tell me, while I hold thee to my bo&s;om, how and wherefore thou art come?</Q> <Q>Do not now a&s;k me,</Q> &s;aid ALMORAN: <Q>it is enough that I am here; and that I am permitted to warn thee of the precipice, on which thou &s;tand|e&s;t. It is enough, that concealed in this darkne&s;s, I have overheard the &s;pecious guile, which &s;ome evil de|mon has practi&s;ed upon thee.</Q> <Q>Is it then certain,</Q> &s;aid HAMET, <Q>that

this being is evil?</Q> <Q>Is not that be|ing evil, &s;aid ALMORAN,</Q> <Q>who pro|po&s;es evil, as the condition of good?</Q> 'Shall I then,' &s;aid HAMET, <Q>renounce my liberty and life? The rack is now ready; and, perhaps, the next mo|ment, its tortures will be inevitable.</Q> 'Let me a&s;k thee then,' &s;aid ALMO|RAN, <Q>to pre&s;erve thy life, wilt thou de&s;troy thy &s;oul?</Q> 'O! &s;tay,' &s;aid HAMET<Q>&mdash;Let me not be tried too far! Let the &s;trength of Him who is Almighty, be manife&s;t in my weak|ne&s;s!</Q> HAMET then pau&s;ed a few mo|ments; but he was no longer in doubt: and ALMORAN, who di&s;be|lieved and de&s;pi&s;ed the arguments, by which he intended to per&s;uade him to renounce what, upon the &s;ame condi|tion, he was impatient to &s;ecure for
<PB N="151" REF="153">
him&s;elf, conceived hopes that he &s;hould &s;ucceed; and tho&s;e hopes were in&s;tantly confirmed.' 'Take then,' &s;aid HA|MET, <Q>this unholy charm; and re|move it far from me, as the &s;ands of Alai from the trees of Oman; le&s;t, in &s;ome dreadful hour, my virtue may fail me, and thy coun&s;el may be want|ing!</Q> Give it me then,' &s;aid ALMO|RAN; and feeling for the hands of each other, he &s;natched it from him in an exta&s;y of joy, and in&s;tantly re&s;uming his own voice and figure, he cried out, <Q>At length I have prevailed: and life and love, dominion and revenge, are now at once in my hand!</Q></P>
<P>HAMET heard and knew the voice of his brother, with a&s;toni&s;hment; but it was too late to wi&s;h that he had with|held
<PB N="152" REF="154">
the charm, which his virtue would not permit him to u&s;e. <Q>Yet a few moments pa&s;s,</Q> &s;aid ALMORAN, <Q>and thou art nothing.</Q> HAMET, who doubted not of the power of the ta|li&s;man, and knew that ALMORAN had no principles which would re&s;train him from u&s;ing it to his de&s;truction, re&s;ign|ed him&s;elf to death, with a &s;acred joy that he had e&s;caped from guilt. AL|MORAN then, with an elation of mind that &s;parkled in his eyes, and glowed upon his cheek, &s;tretched out his hand, in which he held the &s;croll; and a lamp of burning &s;ulphur was immediately &s;u&s;pended in the air before him: he held the my&s;terious writing in the flame; and as it began to burn, the place &s;hook with reiterated thunder, of which every peal was more terrible and more

loud. HAMET, wrapping his robe round him, cried out, <Q>In the Fountain of Life that flows for ever, let my life be mingled! Let me not be, as if I had never been; but &s;till con&s;cious of my being, let me &s;till glorify Him from whom it is derived, and be &s;till happy in his love!</Q></P>
<P>ALMORAN, who was ab&s;orbed in the anticipation of his own felicity, heard the thunder without dread, as the proclamation of his triumph: <Q>Let thy hopes,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>be thy por|tion; and the plea&s;ures that I have &s;ecured, &s;hall be mine.</Q> As he pro|nounced the&s;e words, he &s;tarted as at a &s;udden pang; his eyes became fixed, and his po&s;ture immoveable; yet his &s;en&s;es &s;till remained, and he perceived

the Genius once more to &s;tand before him. 'ALMORAN,' &s;aid he, <Q>to the la&s;t founds which thou &s;halt hear, let thine ear be attentive! Of the &s;pirits that rejoice to fulfill the purpo&s;e of the Almighty, I am one. To HA|MET, and to ALMORAN, I have been commi&s;&s;ioned from above: I have been appointed to perfect virtue, by adver&s;ity; and in the folly of her own projects, to entangle vice. The charm, which could be formed only by guilt, has power only to produce mi&s;ery: of every good, which thou, ALMORAN, would&s;t have &s;ecured by di&s;obedience, the oppo&s;ite evil is thy portion; and of every evil, which thou, HAMET, wa&s;t, by obedience, willing to incur, the oppo&s;ite good is be&s;towed upon thee. To thee, HA|MET,

are now given the throne of thy father, and ALMEIDA. And thou, ALMORAN, who, while I &s;peak, art incorporating with the earth, &s;halt re|main, through all generations, a me|morial of the truths which thy life has taught!</Q></P>
<P>At the words of the Genius, the earth trembled beneath, and above the walls of the pri&s;on di&s;appeared: the fi|gure of ALMORAN, which was har|dened into &s;tone, expanded by degrees; and a rock, by which his form and at|titude are &s;till rudely expre&s;&s;ed, became at once a monument of his puni&s;hment and his guilt.</P>
<P>Such are the events recorded by AC|MET, the de&s;cendant of the Prophet,
<PB N="156" REF="158">
and the preacher of righteou&s;ne&s;s! for, to ACMET, that which pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ecret was revealed by the Angel of in&s;truc|tion, that the world might know, that, to the wicked, increa&s;e of power is in|crea&s;e of wretchedne&s;s; and that tho&s;e who condemn the folly of an attempt to defeat the purpo&s;e of a Genius, might no longer hope to elude the ap|pointment of the Mo&s;t High.</P>
