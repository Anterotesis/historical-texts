<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>HOW highly the Writings of wi&s;e and good Men concerning Government have bin e&s;teem'd in all Ages, the te&s;timony of Hi&s;tory, and the pre&s;ervation of &s;o many Books com|pos'd by the Antients on that Subject, do &s;ufficiently ma|nife&s;t. And it may be truly &s;aid, that unle&s;s men have utterly abandon'd them&s;elves to all that is dete&s;table, they have &s;eldom attempted to detract from the worth of the A&s;&s;ertors of Liberty, tho Ambition and other pa&s;&s;ions have influenc'd them to act in oppo&s;ition to it. When <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> had &s;urpriz'd a young <HI>Roman</HI> who was related to him, reading a political Di&s;cour&s;e of <HI>Cicero,</HI> he commended his judgment in that choice. The Hi&s;tory of <HI>France,</HI> written by the Pre&s;ident <HI>de Thou,</HI> with a &s;pirit of Freedom that might have bin worthy of tho&s;e who liv'd before the violation of their Liberty, has bin &s;o generally valu'd by men of all ranks in that Nation, that 'tis hard to find a Book on any important Subject which has had &s;o many Editions. And the ju&s;t e&s;teem that the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth made of the Memoirs of <HI>Philip de Com|mines</HI> (tho that Author has given &s;o many in&s;tances of his dete&s;tation of Tyranny) may be enough to put this matter out of di&s;pute. But if all other proof were wanting, the implacable hatred, and unweary'd indu&s;try of the wor&s;t of men to &s;uppre&s;s &s;uch Writings, would abundantly te&s;tify their excellency.</P>
<P>That Nations &s;hould be well inform'd of their Rights, is of the mo&s;t ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity: becau&s;e the happine&s;s or infelicity of any People intirely depends upon the enjoyment or deprivation of Liberty; which is &s;o invincibly prov'd in the following Di&s;cour&s;es, that to endeavour to make i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> more clear, would be an unpardonable pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>If any man think the publication of this Work to be un&s;ea&s;onable a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> this time, he is de&s;ir'd to con&s;ider, that as men expect good Laws only from a good Government, &s;o the Reign of a Prince, who&s;e Title is founded upon the principle of Liberty which is here defended, cannot but be the mo&s;t proper, if not the only time to inform the People of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> ju&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">, that from a due &s;en&s;e of their ine&s;timable value, they may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> encourag'd to a&s;&s;ert them again&s;t the attempts of ill men in time to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ome.</P>
<P><PB REF="4" MS="y">
'Tis not nece&s;&s;ary here to &s;ay anything concerning the Per&s;on of the Author. He was &s;o well known in the world, &s;o univer&s;ally e&s;teem'd by tho&s;e who knew how to &s;et a ju&s;t value upon true Merit, and will appear &s;o admirable in the following Di&s;cour&s;es, as not to &s;tand in need of a flattering Panegyrick. But it may not be ami&s;s to &s;ay &s;omething of the Di&s;cour&s;es now publi&s;h'd.</P>
<P>The Paper deliver'd to the Sheriffs immediately before his death in|forms us, that he had left a Large and a Le&s;&s;er Treati&s;e written again&s;t the Principles contain'd in <HI>Filmer</HI>'s Book; and that a &s;mall part of the le&s;&s;er Treati&s;e had bin produc'd for evidence again&s;t him at his Trial. 'Tis there al&s;o &s;aid, that the le&s;&s;er Treati&s;e neither was, nor pro|bably ever &s;hould have bin fini&s;h'd. This therefore is the Large Work mention'd in that Paper, and not the Le&s;&s;er, upon part of which the wicked Sentence pronounc'd, and executed again&s;t him, was grounded.</P>
<P>It remains only to add a few words for &s;atisfaction of the Publick, that the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es are genuine. And here I &s;hall not need to &s;ay, that they were put into the hands of a Per&s;on of eminent Quality and Integrity by the Author him&s;elf; and that the Original is, in the judg|ment of tho&s;e who knew him be&s;t, all written by his own hand: His inimitable manner of treating this noble Subject, is in&s;tead of a thou&s;and demon&s;trations, that the Work can belong to no other than the Great Man who&s;e Name it bears.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION I. INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING lately &s;een a Book intitul'd <HI>Patriarcha,</HI> written by Sir <HI>Robert Filmer,</HI> concerning the Univer&s;al and undi&s;tin|gui&s;h'd Right of all Kings, I thought a time of lei&s;ure might be well employ'd in examining his Doctrin, and the Que|&s;tions ari&s;ing from it; which &s;eem &s;o far to concern all Mankind, that, be&s;ides the Influence upon our future Life, they may be &s;aid to comprehend all that in this World de&s;erves to be car'd for. If he &s;ay true, there is but one Government in the World that can have any thing of Ju&s;tice in it: and tho&s;e who have hitherto bin e&s;teem'd the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of Men, for having con&s;tituted Commonwealths or Kingdoms; and taken much pains &s;o to proportion the Powers of &s;everal Magi&s;tracys, that they might all concur in procuring the Publick Good; or &s;o to divide the Powers between the Magi&s;trats and People, that a well-regulated Harmony might be pre&s;erv'd in the whole, were the mo&s;t unju&s;t and foo|li&s;h of all Men. They were not builders, but overthrowers of Govern|ments: their bu&s;ine&s;s was to &s;et up Ari&s;tocratical, Democratical or mix'd Governments, in oppo&s;ition to that Monarchy which by the immutable Laws of God and Nature is impos'd upon Mankind; or pre&s;umptuou&s;ly to put Shackles upon the Monarch, who by the &s;ame Laws is to be ab&s;o|lute and uncontrol'd: They were rebellious and di&s;obedient Sons, who ro&s;e up again&s;t their Father; and not only refus'd to hearken to his Voice, but made him bend to their Will. In their Opinion, &s;uch only de&s;erv'd to be call'd Good Men, who endeavour'd to be good to Mankind; or to that Country to which they were more particularly related: and in as much as that Good con&s;i&s;ts in a Felicity of E&s;tate, and Perfection of Per&s;on, they highly valued &s;uch as had endeavour'd to make Men better, wi&s;er and happier. This they under&s;tood to be the end for which Men enter'd into Societys: And tho <HI>Cicero</HI> &s;ays, that Commonwealths were in&s;tituted for the obtaining of Ju&s;tice, he contradicts them not, but comprehends all in that
<PB N="2" REF="10">
  word; becau&s;e 'tis ju&s;t that who&s;oever receives a Power, &s;hould employ it wholly for the accompli&s;hment of the Ends for which it was given. This Work could be perform'd only by &s;uch as excell'd in Virtue; but le&s;t they &s;hould deflect from it, no Government was thought to be well con&s;ti|tuted, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Potentiora Legum quam hominum Im|peria. <HI>Tacit.</HI></NOTE>unle&s;s the Laws prevail'd above the Commands of Men; and they were accounted as the wor&s;t of Bea&s;ts, who did not prefer &s;uch a Condi|tion before a Subjection to the fluctuating and irregular Will of a Man.</P>
<P>If we believe Sir <HI>Robert,</HI> all this is mi&s;taken. Nothing of this kind was ever left to the Choice of Men. They are not to inquire what conduces to their own good: God and Nature have put us into a way from which we are not to &s;werve: We are not to live to him, nor to our &s;elves, but to the Ma&s;ter that he hath &s;et over us. One Government is e&s;tabli&s;h'd over all, and no Limits can be &s;et to the Power of the Per&s;on that manages it. This is the Prerogative, or, as another Author of the &s;ame Stamp calls it, the <HI>Royal Charter</HI> granted to Kings by God. They all have an equal right to it; Women and Children are Patriarchs; and the next in Blood, with|out any regard to Age, Sex, or other Qualitys of the Mind or Body, are Fathers of as many Nations as fall under their Power. We are not to examin, whether he or &s;he be young or old, virtuous or vicious, &s;ober minded or &s;tark mad; the Right and Power is the &s;ame in all. Whether Virtue be exalted or &s;uppre&s;t; whether he that bears the Sword be a Prai&s;e to tho&s;e that do well, and a Terror to tho&s;e that do evil; or a Prai&s;e to tho&s;e that do evil, and a Terror to &s;uch as do well, it concerns us not; for the King mu&s;t not lo&s;e his Right, nor have his Power dimini&s;h'd on any account. I have bin &s;ometimes apt to wonder, how things of this nature could enter into the head of any Man: Or, if no Wickedne&s;s or Folly be &s;o great, but &s;ome may fall into it, I could not well conceive why they &s;hould publi&s;h it to the World. But the&s;e thoughts ceas'd, when I con&s;ider'd that a People from all Ages in love with Liberty, and de&s;irous to maintain their own Privileges, could never be brought to re&s;ign 'em, unle&s;s they were made to believe that in Con&s;cience they ought to do it; which could not be, unle&s;s they were al&s;o per&s;uaded to believe, that there was a Law &s;et to all Mankind which none might tran&s;|gre&s;s, and which put the Examination of all tho&s;e Matters out of their power. This is our Author's Work. By this it will appear who&s;e Throne he &s;eeks to advance, and who&s;e Servant he is, whil&s;t he pretends to &s;erve the King. And that it may be evident he has made u&s;e of Means &s;utable to the Ends propos'd for the Service of his great Ma&s;ter, I hope to &s;hew that he has not us'd one Argument that is not fal&s;e, nor cited one Author whom he has not perverted and abus'd. Whil&s;t my work is &s;o to lay open the&s;e Snares that the mo&s;t &s;imple may not be taken in them, I &s;hall not examin how Sir <HI>Robert</HI> came to think him&s;elf a Man fit to un|dertake &s;o great a Work, as to de&s;troy the Principles, which from the be|ginning &s;eem to have bin common to all Mankind; but only weighing the Po&s;itions and Arguments that he alledges, will, if there be either truth or &s;trength in them, confe&s;s the Di&s;covery comes from him that gave us lea&s;t rea&s;on to expect it; and that in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e of the Antients, there is not in the World a Piece of Wood out of which a <HI>Mercury</HI> may not be made.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II.   The common Notions of Liberty are not from School-Divines, but from Nature.</HEAD>
<P>IN the fir&s;t Lines of his Book he &s;eems to denounce War again&s;t Man|kind, endeavouring to overthrow the Principle of Liberty in which God created us, and which includes the chief Advantages of the Life we enjoy, as well as the greate&s;t helps towards the Felicity, that is the end of our hopes in the other. To this end he ab&s;urdly imputes to the School-Di|vines that which was taken up by 'em as a common Notion, written in the Hearts of all Men, denied by none but &s;uch as are degenerated into Bea&s;ts, from whence they might prove &s;uch Points as of them&s;elves were le&s;s evi|dent. Thus did <HI>Euclid</HI> lay down certain Axioms, which none could deny that did not renounce common Sen&s;e, from whence he drew the Proofs of &s;uch Propo&s;itions as were le&s;s obvious to the Under&s;tanding; and they may with as much rea&s;on be accus'd of Pagani&s;m, who &s;ay that the Whole is greater than a Part, that two Halfs make the Whole, or that a &s;treight Line is the &s;horte&s;t way from Point to Point, as to &s;ay, that they who in Politicks lay &s;uch Foundations as have bin taken up by Schoolmen and others as undeniable Truths, do therefore follow them, or have any regard to their Authority. Tho the Schoolmen were corrupt, they were neither &s;tupid nor unlearned: They could not but &s;ee that which all Men &s;aw, nor lay more approv'd Foundations, than, That Man is naturally free; That he cannot ju&s;tly be depriv'd of that Liberty without cau&s;e, and that he dos not re&s;ign it, or any part of it, unle&s;s it be in con&s;ideration of a greater good, which he propo&s;es to him&s;elf. But if he unju&s;tly imputes the In|vention of this to School-Divines, he in &s;ome mea&s;ure repairs his Fault in &s;aying, <HI>This has bin fo&s;ter'd by all &s;ucceeding Papi&s;ts for good Divinity: The Divines of the reformed Churches have entertain'd it, and the Common Peo|ple every where tenderly embrace it.</HI> That is to &s;ay, all Chri&s;tian Divines, whether reform'd or unreform'd, do approve it, and the People every where magnify it, as the height of human Felicity. But <HI>Filmer</HI> and &s;uch as are like to him, being neither reform'd nor unreform'd Chri&s;tians, nor of the People, can have no Title to Chri&s;tianity; and, in as much as they &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t that which is the height of human Felicity, they declare them&s;elves Enemys to all that are concern'd in it, that is, to all Mankind.</P>
<P>But, &s;ays he, <HI>They do not remember that the de&s;ire of Liberty was the fir&s;t cau&s;e of the Fall of Man:</HI> and I de&s;ire it may not be forgotten, that the Liberty a&s;&s;erted is not a Licentiou&s;ne&s;s of doing what is plea&s;ing to every one again&s;t the Command of God; but an Exemption from all human Laws, to which they have not given their a&s;&s;ent. If he would make us believe there was any thing of this in <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sin, he ought to have prov'd, that the Law which he tran&s;gre&s;t was impos'd upon him by Man, and con&s;equently that there was a Man to impo&s;e it; for it will ea&s;ily appear that neither the reform'd or unreform'd Divines, nor the People following them, do place the Felicity of Man in an exemption from the Laws of God, but in a mo&s;t perfect conformity to them. Our Saviour taught us <HI>not to fear &s;uch as could kill the Body, but him that could kill and ca&s;t into</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="12">
  <HI>Hell:</HI> And the Apo&s;tle tells us that <HI>we &s;hould obey God rather than Man.</HI> It has bin ever hereupon ob&s;erv'd, that they who mo&s;t preci&s;ely adhere to the Laws of God, are lea&s;t &s;ollicitous concerning the Commands of Men, unle&s;s they are well grounded; and tho&s;e who mo&s;t delight in the glorious Liberty of the Sons of God, do not only &s;ubject them&s;elves to him, but are mo&s;t regular Ob&s;ervers of the ju&s;t Ordinances of Man, made by the con&s;ent of &s;uch as are concern'd according to the Will of God.</P>
<P>The Error of not ob&s;erving this may perhaps de&s;erve to be pardon'd in a Man that had read no Books, as proceeding from Ignorance; if &s;uch as are gro&s;ly ignorant can be excus'd, when they take upon them to write of &s;uch Matters as require the highe&s;t knowledg: But in Sir <HI>Robert</HI> 'tis pre|varication and fraud to impute to Schoolmen and Puritans that which in his fir&s;t Page he acknowledg'd to be the Doctrin of all Reform'd and Un|reform'd Chri&s;tian Churches, and that he knows to have bin the Princi|ple in which the <HI>Grecians, Italians, Spaniards, Gauls, Germans,</HI> and <HI>Bri|tans,</HI> and all other generous Nations ever liv'd, before the Name of Chri&s;t was known in the World; in&s;omuch that the ba&s;e effeminate <HI>A&s;iaticks</HI> and <HI>Africans,</HI> for being carele&s;s of their Liberty, or unable to govern them|&s;elves, were by <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> and other wi&s;e Men call'd <HI>Slaves by Nature,</HI> and look'd upon as little different from Bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>This which hath its Root in common Sen&s;e, not being to be overthrown by Rea&s;on, he &s;pares his pains of &s;eeking any; but thinks it enough to render his Doctrin plau&s;ible to his own Party, by joining the Je&s;uits to <HI>Geneva,</HI> and coupling <HI>Buchanan</HI> to <HI>Doleman,</HI> as both maintaining the &s;ame Doctrin: tho he might as well have join'd the <HI>Puritans</HI> with the <HI>Turks,</HI> becau&s;e they all think that one and one makes two. But whoever marks the Proceedings of <HI>Filmer</HI> and his Ma&s;ters, as well as his Di&s;ciples, will ra|ther believe that they have learn'd from <HI>Rome</HI> and the Je&s;uits to hate <HI>Gene|va,</HI> than that <HI>Geneva</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> can agree in any thing farther than as they are oblig'd to &s;ubmit to the Evidence of Truth; or that <HI>Geneva</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> can concur in any De&s;ign or Intere&s;t that is not common to Mankind.</P>
<P><HI>The&s;e Men allow'd to the People a liberty of depo&s;ing their Princes. This is a de&s;perate Opinion.</HI> Bellarmin <HI>and</HI> Calvin <HI>look a&s;quint at it.</HI> But why is this a de&s;perate Opinion? If Di&s;agreements happen between King and People, why is it a more de&s;perate Opinion to think the King &s;hould be &s;ubject to the Cen&s;ures of the People, than the People &s;ubject to the Will of the King? Did the People make the King, or the King make the Peo|ple? Is the King for the People, or the People for the King? Did God create the <HI>Hebrews</HI> that <HI>Saul</HI> might reign over them? or did they, from an opinion of procuring their own Good, ask a King, that might judg them, and fight their Battels? If God's interpo&s;ition, which &s;hall be hereafter explain'd, dos alter the Ca&s;e; did the <HI>Romans</HI> make <HI>Romulus, Numa, Tullus Ho&s;tilius,</HI> and <HI>Tarquinius Pri&s;cus</HI> Kings? or did they make or beget the <HI>Romans?</HI> If they were made Kings by the <HI>Romans,</HI> 'tis certain they that made them &s;ought their own good in &s;o doing; and if they were made by and for the City and People, I de&s;ire to know if it was not better, that when their Succe&s;&s;ors departed from the End of their In&s;titution, by en|deavouring to de&s;troy it, or all that was good in it, they &s;hould be cen|&s;ur'd and ejected, than be permitted to ruin that People for who&s;e good they were created? Was it more ju&s;t that <HI>Caligula</HI> or <HI>Nero</HI> &s;hould be &s;uf|fer'd to de&s;troy the poor Remains of the <HI>Roman</HI> Nobility and People, with the Nations &s;ubject to that Empire, than that the Race of &s;uch Mon&s;ters
<PB N="5" REF="13">
&s;hould be extingui&s;h'd, and a great part of Mankind, e&s;pecially the be&s;t,   again&s;t whom they were mo&s;t fierce, pre&s;erv'd by their Death?</P>
<P>I pre&s;ume our Author thought the&s;e Que&s;tions might be ea&s;ily decided; and that no more was requir'd to &s;hew the foremention'd A&s;&s;ertions were not at all de&s;perate, than to examin the Grounds of them; but he &s;eeks to divert us from this enquiry, by propo&s;ing the dreadful Con&s;equences of &s;ubjecting Kings to the Cen&s;ures of their People: whereas no Con&s;equence can de&s;troy any Truth; and the wor&s;t of this is, That if it were receiv'd, &s;ome Princes might be re&s;train'd from doing Evil, or puni&s;h'd if they will not be re&s;train'd. We are therefore only to con&s;ider whether the People, Senat, or any Magi&s;tracy made by and for the People, have, or can have &s;uch a Right; for if they have, what&s;oever the Con&s;equences may be, it mu&s;t &s;tand: And as the one tends to the Good of Mankind in re&s;training the Lu&s;ts of wicked Kings; the other expo&s;es'em without Remedy to the Fury of the mo&s;t &s;avage of all Bea&s;ts. I am not a&s;ham'd in this to concur with <HI>Buchanan, Calvin,</HI> or <HI>Bellarmin;</HI> and without Envy leave to <HI>Filmer</HI> and his A&s;&s;ociats the Glory of maintaining the contrary.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding our Author's aver&s;ion to Truth, he confe&s;&s;es, <HI>That</HI> Hayward, Blackwood, Barclay, <HI>and others who have bravely vindicated the Right of Kings in this Point, do with one con&s;ent admit, as an unque&s;tiona|ble Truth, and a&s;&s;ent unto the natural Liberty and Equality of Mankind, not &s;o much as once que&s;tioning or oppo&s;ing it.</HI> And indeed I believe, that tho &s;ince the Sin of our fir&s;t Parents the Earth has brought forth Briars and Brambles, and the Nature of Man has bin fruitful only in Vice and Wick|edne&s;s; neither the Authors he mentions, nor any others, have had impu|dence enough to deny &s;uch evident Truth as &s;eems to be planted in the Hearts of all Men; or to publi&s;h Doctrins &s;o contrary to common Sen&s;e, Virtue, and Humanity, till the&s;e Times. The production of <HI>Laud, Man|waring, Sibthorp, Hobbs, Filmer</HI> and <HI>Heylin,</HI> &s;eems to have bin re&s;erv'd as an additional Cur&s;e to compleat the Shame and Mi&s;ery of our Age and Country. Tho&s;e who had Wit and Learning, with &s;omething of Inge|nuity and Mode&s;ty, tho they believ'd that Nations might po&s;&s;ibly make an ill u&s;e of their Power, and were very de&s;irous to maintain the Cau&s;e of Kings, as far as they could put any good colour upon it; yet never denied that &s;ome had &s;uffer'd ju&s;tly (which could not be, i&s; there were no Pow|er of judging them) nor ever a&s;&s;erted any thing that might arm them with an irre&s;i&s;tible Power of doing mi&s;chief, animate them to per&s;i&s;t in the mo&s;t flagitious Cour&s;es, with a&s;&s;urance of perpetual Impunity, or en|gage Nations in an inevitable nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uffering all manner of Outra|ges. They knew that the Actions of tho&s;e Princes who were not altoge|ther dete&s;table, might be defended by particular Rea&s;ons drawn from them, or the Laws of their Country; and would neither undertake the defence of &s;uch as were abominable, nor bring Princes, to whom they wi&s;h'd well, into the odious extremity of ju&s;tifying them&s;elves by Argu|ments that favour'd <HI>Caligula</HI> and <HI>Nero,</HI> as well as them&s;elves, and that mu&s;t be taken for a Confe&s;&s;ion, that they were as bad as could be ima|gin'd; &s;ince nothing could be &s;aid for them that might not as well be ap|plied to the wor&s;t that had bin, or could be. But <HI>Filmer, Heylin,</HI> and their A&s;&s;ociats, &s;corning to be re&s;train'd by &s;uch con&s;iderations, boldly lay the Ax to the Root of the Tree, and rightly enough affirm, <HI>That the whole Fabrick of that which they call Popular Sedition would fall to the ground, if the Principle of natural Liberty were remov'd.</HI> And on the other hand it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd that the whole Fabrick of Tyranny will

  be much weaken'd, if we prove, That Nations have a right to make their own Laws, con&s;titute their own Magi&s;trats; and that &s;uch as are &s;o con&s;tituted, owe an account of their Actions to tho&s;e by whom, and for whom they are appointed.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III. Implicit Faith belongs to Fools, and Truth is comprehended by examin|ing Principles.</HEAD>
<P>WHILST <HI>Filmer</HI>'s bu&s;ine&s;s is to overthrow Liberty and Truth, he, in his Pa&s;&s;age, mode&s;tly profe&s;&s;es <HI>not to meddle with Mysterys of State,</HI> or <HI>Arcana Imperii.</HI> He renounces tho&s;e Inquirys thro an <HI>implicit Faith,</HI> which never enter'd into the head of any but Fools, and &s;uch as, thro a carele&s;ne&s;s of the Point in que&s;tion, acted as if they were &s;o. This is the Foundation of the Papal Power, and it can &s;tand no longer than tho&s;e that compo&s;e the <HI>Roman</HI> Church can be per&s;uaded to &s;ubmit their Con&s;ciences to the Word of the Prie&s;ts, and e&s;teem them&s;elves di&s;charg'd from the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;earching the Scriptures, in order to know whether the things that are told them are true of fal&s;e. This may &s;hew whether our Author or tho&s;e of <HI>Geneva</HI> do be&s;t agree with the <HI>Roman</HI> Doctrin. But his In&s;tance is yet more &s;otti&s;h than his Profe&s;&s;ion: <HI>An Implicit Faith,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>is given to the meane&s;t Artificer.</HI> I wonder by whom! Who will wear a Shoo that hurts him, becau&s;e the Shoo-maker tells him 'tis well made? or who will live in a Hou&s;e that yields no defence again&s;t the ex|tremitys of Weather, becau&s;e the Ma&s;on or Carpenter a&s;&s;ures him 'tis a very good Hou&s;e? Such as have Rea&s;on, Under&s;tanding, or common Sen&s;e, will, and ought to make u&s;e of it in tho&s;e things that concern them&s;elves and their Po&s;terity, and &s;u&s;pect the Words of &s;uch as are in|tere&s;ted in deceiving or per&s;uading them not to &s;ee with their own Eyes, that they may be more ea&s;ily deceiv'd. This Rule obliges us &s;o far to &s;earch into Matters of State, as to examin the Original Principles of Government in general, and of our own in particular. We cannot di&s;tin|gui&s;h Truth from Fal&s;hood, Right from Wrong, or know what Obedi|ence we owe to the Magi&s;trat, or what we may ju&s;tly expect from him, unle&s;s we know what he is, why he is, and by whom he is made to be what he is. The&s;e perhaps may be call'd <HI>Mysterys of State,</HI> and &s;ome would per&s;uade us they are to be e&s;teem'd <HI>Arcana;</HI> but who&s;oever confe&s;&s;es him|&s;elf to be ignorant of 'em, mu&s;t acknowledg he is uncapable of giving any judgment upon things relating to the Super&s;tructure, and in &s;o doing evidently &s;hews to others, that they ought not at all to hearken to what he &s;ays.</P>
<P>His Argument to prove this is more admirable. <HI>If an Implicit Faith,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>is given to the meane&s;t Artificer in his Craft, much more to a Prince in the profound Secrets of Government.</HI> But where is the Con&s;equence? If I tru&s;t to the judgment of an Artificer, or one of a more ingenuous Pro|fe&s;&s;ion, 'tis not becau&s;e he is of it, but becau&s;e I am per&s;uaded he dos well under&s;tand it, and that he will be &s;aithful to me in things relating to his Art. I do not &s;end for <HI>Lower</HI> or <HI>Micklethwait</HI> when I am &s;ick, nor ask the Advice of <HI>Maynard</HI> or <HI>Jones</HI> in a Suit of Law, becau&s;e the fir&s;t are Phy&s;icians, and the other Lawyers; but becau&s;e I think them wi&s;e, learned,
<PB N="7" REF="15">
diligent, and faithful, there being a multitude of others who go under   the &s;ame name, who&s;e Opinion I would never ask. Therefore if any Conclu&s;ion can be drawn from thence in favour of Princes, it mu&s;t be of &s;uch as have all the Qualitys of Ability and Integrity, that &s;hould create this confidence in me; or it mu&s;t be prov'd that all Princes, in as much as they are Princes, have &s;uch Qualitys. No general Conclu&s;ion can be drawn from the fir&s;t Ca&s;e, becau&s;e it mu&s;t depend upon the Circum|&s;tances, which ought to be particularly prov'd: And if the other be a&s;|&s;erted, I de&s;ire to know whether <HI>Caligula, Claudius, Nero, Vitellius, Do|mitian, Commodus, Heliogabalus,</HI> and others not unlike to them, had tho&s;e admirable Endowments, upon which an Implicit Faith ought to have bin grounded; how they came by them; and whether we have any Promi&s;e from God, that all Princes &s;hould for ever excel in tho&s;e Vertues, or whe|ther by experience we find that they do &s;o. If they are or have bin want|ing in any, the whole falls to the ground; for no Man enjoys as a Prince that which is not common to all Princes: And if every Prince has not Wi&s;dom to under&s;tand the&s;e profound Secrets, Integrity to direct him, ac|cording to what he knows to be good, and a &s;ufficient mea&s;ure of Indu|&s;try and Valour to protect me, he is not the Artificer to whom the Impli|cit Faith is due. His Eyes are as &s;ubject to dazle as my own. But 'tis a &s;hame to in&s;i&s;t on &s;uch a Point as this. We &s;ee Princes of all &s;orts; they are born as other Men: The vile&s;t Flatterer dares not deny that they are wi&s;e or fooli&s;h, good or bad, valiant or cowardly, like other Men: and the Crown dos neither be&s;tow extraordinary Qualitys, ripen &s;uch as are found in Princes &s;ooner than in the meane&s;t, nor pre&s;erve them from the decays of Age, Sickne&s;s, or other Accidents, to which all Men are &s;ubject. And if the greate&s;t King in the World falls into them, he is as uncapable of that my&s;terious Knowledg, and his Judgment is as little to be relied on, as that of the poore&s;t Pea&s;ant.</P>
<P>This Matter is not mended by &s;ending us to &s;eek tho&s;e Vertues in the Mini&s;ters, which are wanting in the Prince. The ill effects of <HI>Rehobo|am</HI>'s Folly could not be corrected by the Wi&s;dom of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Coun&s;el|lors: He rejected them; and &s;uch as are like to him will always do the &s;ame thing. <HI>Nero</HI> advis'd with none but Mu&s;icians, Players, Chariot|drivers, or the abominable Mini&s;ters of his Plea&s;ures and Crueltys. <HI>Ar|cadius</HI> his Senat was chiefly compos'd of Buffoons and Cooks, influenc'd by an old ra&s;cally Eunuch. And 'tis an eternal Truth, that a weak or wicked Prince can never chu&s;e a wi&s;e Council, nor receive any benefit by one that is impos'd upon him, unle&s;s they have a Power of acting with|out him, which would render the Government in effect Ari&s;tocratical, and would probably di&s;plea&s;e our Author as much as if it were &s;o in name al&s;o. Good and wi&s;e Coun&s;ellors do not grow up like Mu&s;hrooms; great Judgment is requir'd in chu&s;ing and preparing them. If a weak or vi|cious Prince &s;hould be &s;o happy to find them cho&s;en to his hand, they would avail him nothing. There will ever be variety of Opinions a|mong&s;t 'em; and he that is of a perverted Judgment will always chu&s;e the wor&s;e of tho&s;e that are propos'd, and favour the wor&s;t Men, as mo&s;t like to him&s;elf. Therefore if this Implicit Faith be grounded upon a &s;up|po&s;ition of profound Wi&s;dom in the Prince, the Foundation is over|thrown, and cannot &s;tand; for to repo&s;e confidence in the Judgment and Integrity of one that has none, is the mo&s;t bruti&s;h of all Follys. So that if a Prince may have or want the Qualitys, upon which my Faith in him can be rationally grounded, I cannot yield the Obedience he requires, un|le&s;s

He enjoins an active or pa&s;&s;ive Obedience, before he &s;hews what &s;hould ob|lige or per&s;uade us to it. This indeed were a compendious way of obvia|ting that which he calls <HI>Popular Sedition,</HI> and of expo&s;ing all Nations, that fall under the Power of Tyrants, to be de&s;troy'd utterly by them. <HI>Nero</HI> or <HI>Domitian</HI> would have de&s;ir'd no more, than that tho&s;e who would not execute their wicked Commands, &s;hould patiently have &s;uffer'd their Throats to be cut by &s;uch as were le&s;s &s;crupulous: And the World that had &s;uffer'd tho&s;e Mon&s;ters for &s;ome years, mu&s;t have continu'd under their Fury, till all that was good and virtuous had bin aboli&s;h'd. But in tho&s;e Ages and Parts of the World, where there has bin any thing of Vertue and Goodne&s;s, we may ob&s;erve a third &s;ort of Men, who would neither do Villanys, nor &s;uffer more than the Laws did permit, or the con&s;ideration of the publick Peace did require. Whil&s;t Tyrants with their Slaves, and the In&s;truments of their Crueltys, were accounted the Dregs of Mankind, and made the objects of dete&s;tation and &s;corn, the&s;e Men who deliver'd their Countrys from &s;uch Plagues were thought to have &s;omething of Divine in them, and have bin famous above all the re&s;t of Mankind to this day. Of this &s;ort were <HI>Pelopidas, Epaminondas, Thra|&s;ibulus, Harmodius, Ari&s;togiton, Philopemen, Lucius Brutus, Publius Va|lerius, Marcus Brutus, C. Ca&s;&s;ius, M.

Such as were In&s;truments of the like De|liverances among&s;t the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> as <HI>Mo&s;es, Othniel, Ehud, Barac, Gideon, Samp&s;on, Jephtha, Samuel, David, Jehu,</HI> the <HI>Maccabees</HI> and others, have from the Scriptures a certain Te&s;timony of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of their Proceedings, when they neither would act what was evil, nor &s;uffer more than was rea&s;onable. But le&s;t we &s;hould learn by their Examples, and the Prai&s;es given to them, our Author confines the Subject's choice to acting or &s;uffering, that is, doing what is commanded, or lying down to have his Throat cut, or to &s;ee his Family and Country made de&s;olate.

<HEAD>SECT. V. To depend upon the Will of a Man is Slavery.</HEAD>
<P>THis, as he thinks, is farther &s;weeten'd, by a&s;&s;erting, that he dos not inquire what the Rights of a People are, but from whence; not con&s;idering, that whil&s;t he denies they can proceed from the Laws of natural Liberty, or any other Root than the Grace and Bounty of the Prince, he declares they can have none at all. For as Liberty &s;olely con|&s;i&s;ts in an independency upon the Will of another, and by the name of Slave we under&s;tand a Man, who can neither di&s;po&s;e of his Per&s;on nor Goods, but enjoys all at the will of his Ma&s;ter; there is no &s;uch thing in nature as a Slave, if tho&s;e Men or Nations are not Slaves, who have no other title to what they enjoy, than the grace of the Prince, which he may revoke when&s;oever he plea&s;es. But there is more than ordinary Ex|travagance in his A&s;&s;ertion, That <HI>the greate&s;t Liberty in the World is for a People to live under a Monarch,</HI> when his whole Book is to prove, That this Monarch has his Right from God and Nature, is endow'd with an unlimited Power of doing what he plea&s;es, and can be re&s;train'd by no Law. If it be Liberty to live under &s;uch a Government, I de&s;ire to know what is Slavery. It has bin hitherto believ'd in the World, that the <HI>A&s;&s;y|rians, Medes, Arabs, Egyptians, Turks,</HI> and others like them, liv'd in Slavery, becau&s;e their Princes were Ma&s;ters of their Lives and Goods: Whereas the <HI>Grecians, Italians, Gauls, Germans, Spaniards,</HI> and <HI>Cartha|ginians,</HI> as long as they had any Strength, Vertue or Courage among&s;t 'em, were e&s;teem'd free Nations, becau&s;e they abhor'd &s;uch a Subjection. They were, and would be govern'd only by Laws of their own making: <HI>Potentiora erant Legum quam hominum Imperia.</HI> Even their <HI>Princes had the</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">C. Tacit&punc; Ibid.</NOTE><HI>Authority or Credit of Per&s;uading, rather than the Power of Commanding.</HI> But all this was mi&s;taken: The&s;e Men were Slaves, and the <HI>A&s;iaticks</HI> were Freemen. By the &s;ame rule the <HI>Venetians, Switzers, Gri&s;ons,</HI> and <HI>Hol|landers,</HI> are not free Nations: but Liberty in its perfection is enjoy'd in <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Turky.</HI> The Intention of our Ance&s;tors was, without doubt, to e&s;tabli&s;h this among&s;t us by <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> and other preceding or &s;ub|&s;equent Laws; but they ought to have added one clau&s;e, That the Con|tents of 'em &s;hould be in &s;orce only &s;o long as it pleas'd the King. King <HI>Alfred,</HI> upon who&s;e Laws <HI>Magna Charta</HI> was grounded, when he &s;aid the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation was as free as the internal thoughts of a Man, did only mean, that it &s;hould be &s;o as long as it pleas'd their Ma&s;ter.

<P>We owe the di&s;covery of the&s;e Secrets to our Author, who after having gravely declar'd 'em, thinks no offence ought to be taken at the freedom he a&s;&s;umes of examining things relating to the Liberty of Mankind, be|cau&s;e he has the Right which is common to all. But he ought to have con&s;ider'd, that in a&s;&s;erting that Right to him&s;elf, he allows it to all Mankind. And as the temporal good of all Men con&s;i&s;ts in the pre&s;erva|tion of it, he declares him&s;elf to be their mortal Enemy, who endeavours to de&s;troy it. If he were alive, this would de&s;erve to be an&s;wer'd with Stones rather than Words. He that oppugns the publick Liberty, over|throws his own, and is guilty of the mo&s;t bruti&s;h of all Follys, whil&s;t he arrogates to him&s;elf that which he denies to all Men.</P>
<P>I cannot but commend his Mode&s;ty and Care <HI>not to detract from the Worth of Learned Men;</HI> but it &s;eems they were all &s;ubject to error, except him&s;elf, who is render'd infallible thro Pride, Ignorance, and Impudence. But if <HI>Hooker</HI> and <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> were wrong in their Fundamentals concerning natural Liberty, how could they be in the right when they built upon it? Or if they did mi&s;take, how can they de&s;erve to be cited? or rather, why is &s;uch care taken to pervert their Sen&s;e? It &s;eems our Author is by their Errors brought to the knowledg of the Truth. <HI>Men have heard of a Dwarf &s;tanding on the Shoulders of a Giant, who &s;aw farther than the Giant; but now that the Dwarf &s;tanding on the Ground &s;ees that which the Giant did overlook,</HI> we mu&s;t learn from him. If there be Sen&s;e in this, the Giant mu&s;t be blind, or have &s;uch eyes only as are of no u&s;e to him. He minded only the things that were far from him: The&s;e Great and Learned Men mi&s;took the very Principle and Foundation of all their Doctrin. If we believe our Author, this misfortune befel them, becau&s;e they too much tru&s;ted to the Schoolmen. He names <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> and I pre&s;ume intends to comprehend <HI>Plato, Plutarch, Thucydides, Xenophon, Polybius,</HI> and all the antient <HI>Grecians, Italians,</HI> and others, who a&s;&s;erted the natural Free|dom of Mankind, only in imitation of the Schoolmen, to advance the Power of the Pope; and would have compa&s;t their de&s;ign, if <HI>Filmer</HI> and his A&s;&s;ociats had not oppos'd 'em. The&s;e Men had taught us to make the <HI>unnatural Di&s;tinction between Royali&s;t and Patriot;</HI> and kept us from &s;eeing, <HI>That the relation between King and People is &s;o great that their well-being is reciprocal.</HI> If this be true, how came <HI>Tarquin</HI> to think it good for him to continue King at <HI>Rome,</HI> when the People would turn him out? or the People to think it good for them to turn him out, when he de&s;ir'd to continue in? Why did the <HI>Syracu&s;ians</HI> de&s;troy the Tyranny of <HI>Diony&s;ius,</HI> which he was not willing to leave, till he was pull'd out by the heels? How could <HI>Nero</HI> think of burning <HI>Rome?</HI> Or why did <HI>Caligula</HI> wi&s;h the People had but one Neck, that he might &s;trike it off at one blow, if their Wel&s;are was thus reciprocal? 'Tis not enough to &s;ay, The&s;e were wicked or mad Men; for other Princes may be &s;o al&s;o, and there may be the &s;ame rea&s;on of differing from them. For if the Propo&s;ition be not univer&s;ally true, 'tis not to be receiv'd as true in relation to any, till it be particularly prov'd; and then 'tis not to be imputed to the Quality of Prince, but to the per&s;onal Vertue of the Man.</P>

<P>BUT Sir <HI>Robert de&s;ires to make Ob&s;ervations on</HI> Bellarmin<HI>'s words, before he examins or refutes them;</HI> and indeed it were not po&s;&s;ible to make &s;uch &s;tuff of his Doctrin as he dos, if he had examin'd or did under&s;tand it. Fir&s;t, he very wittily concludes, <HI>That if by the Law of God, the Power be immediatly in the People, God is the Author of a Democracy:</HI> And why not as well as of a Tyranny? Is there any thing in it repugnant to the Being of God? Is there more rea&s;on to impute to God <HI>Caligula</HI>'s Monarchy, than the Democracy of <HI>Athens?</HI> Or is it more for the Glory of God, to a&s;&s;ert his Pre&s;ence with the <HI>Ottoman</HI> or <HI>French</HI> Monarchs, than with the popular Governments of the <HI>Swit&s;ers</HI> and <HI>Gri&s;ons?</HI> Is Pride, Malice, Luxury and Violence &s;o &s;utable to his Being, that they who exerci&s;e them are to be reputed his Mini&s;ters? And is Mode&s;ty, Humility, Equality, and Ju&s;tice &s;o contrary to his Nature, that they who live in them &s;hould be thought his Enemys? Is there any ab&s;urdity in &s;aying, that &s;ince God in Goodne&s;s and Mercy to Mankind, has with an equal hand given to all the Benefit of Liberty, with &s;ome mea&s;ure of under&s;tanding how to employ it, 'tis lawful for any Nation, as occa&s;ion &s;hall require, to give the Exerci&s;e of that Power to one or more Men, under certain Limitations or Conditions; or to retain it in them&s;elves, if they think it good for them? If this may be done, we are at the end of all Controver&s;ys concerning one Form of Government e&s;tabli&s;h'd by God, to which all Mankind mu&s;t &s;ubmit; and we may &s;afely conclude, that having given to all Men in &s;ome degree a Capacity of judging what is good for them&s;elves, he has granted to all likewi&s;e a Liberty of inventing &s;uch Forms as plea&s;e them be&s;t, without favouring one more than another.</P>
<P>His &s;econd Ob&s;ervation is grounded upon a Fal&s;ity in matter of Fact. <HI>Bellarmin</HI> dos not &s;ay, that Democracy is an Ordinance of God more than any other Government; nor that the People have no Power to make u&s;e of their Right; but that they do, that is to &s;ay ordinarily, tran&s;mit the Exerci&s;e of it to one or more. And 'tis certain they do &s;ometimes,
<PB N="12" REF="20">
  e&s;pecially in &s;mall Citys, retain it in them&s;elves: But whether that were ob&s;erv'd or not by <HI>Bellarmin,</HI> makes nothing to our Cau&s;e, which we defend, and not him.</P>
<P>The next Point is &s;ubtile, and he thinks thereby to have brought <HI>Bel|arrmin,</HI> and &s;uch as agree with his Principle, to a Nonplus. He doubts who &s;hall judg of the lawful cau&s;e of changing the Govern|ment, and &s;ays, It is <HI>a pe&s;tilent Conclu&s;ion to place that Power in the Multitude.</HI> But why &s;hould this be e&s;teem'd pe&s;tilent? or to whom? If the allowance of &s;uch a Power to the Senat was pe&s;tilent to <HI>Ne|ro,</HI> it was beneficial to Mankind; and the denial of it, which would have given to <HI>Nero</HI> an opportunity of continuing in his Villanys, would have bin pe&s;tilent to the be&s;t of Men, whom he endea|vour'd to de&s;troy, and to all others that receiv'd benefit from them. But this Que&s;tion depends upon another; for if Governments are con|&s;tituted for the Plea&s;ure, Greatne&s;s or Profit of one Man, he mu&s;t not be interrupted; for the oppo&s;ing of his Will, is to overthrow the In&s;ti|tution. On the other &s;ide, if the Good of the Governed be &s;ought, care mu&s;t be taken that the End be accompli&s;h'd, tho it be with the prejudice of the Governor: If the Power be originally in the Multitude, and one or more Men, to whom the exerci&s;e of it, or a part of it was committed, had no more than their Brethren, till it was confer'd on him or them, it cannot be believ'd that rational Creatures would advance one or a few of their Equals above them&s;elves, unle&s;s in con&s;ideration of their own Good; and then I find no inconvenience in leaving to them a right of judging, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cujus e&s;t in|&s;tituere, ejus e&s;t abrogate.</NOTE>whether this be duly perform'd or not. We &s;ay in general, <HI>He that in&s;ti|tutes, may al&s;o abrogate,</HI> mo&s;t e&s;pecially when the In&s;titution is not only by, but for him&s;elf. If the Multitude therefore do in&s;titute, the Multitude may abrogate; and they them&s;elves, or tho&s;e who &s;ucceed in the &s;ame Right, can only be fit Judges of the performance of the Ends of the In&s;titu|tion. Our Author may perhaps &s;ay, The publick Peace may be hereby di&s;turb'd: but he ought to know, There can be no Peace, where there is no Ju&s;tice; nor any Ju&s;tice, if the Government in&s;tituted for the good of a Nation be turn'd to its ruin. But in plain Engli&s;h, the Inconveni|ence with which &s;uch as he endeavour to afright us, is no more than that He or They, to whom the Power is given, may be re&s;train'd or cha&s;tis'd, if they betray their Tru&s;t; which I pre&s;ume will di&s;plea&s;e none, but &s;uch as would rather &s;ubject <HI>Rome</HI> with the be&s;t part of the World depending on it, to the Will of <HI>Caligula</HI> or <HI>Nero,</HI> than <HI>Caligula</HI> or <HI>Nero</HI> to the Judg|ment of the Senat and People; that is, rather to expo&s;e many great and brave Nations to be de&s;troy'd by the rage of a &s;avage Bea&s;t, than &s;ubject that Bea&s;t to the Judgment of all, or the choice&s;t Men of them, who can have no intere&s;t to pervert them, or other rea&s;on to be &s;evere to him, than to prevent the Mi&s;chiefs he would commit, and to &s;ave the People from ruin.</P>
<P>In the next place he recites an Argument of <HI>Bellarmin,</HI> That <HI>'tis evident in Scripture God has ordain'd Powers; but God has given them to no particu|lar Per&s;on, becau&s;e by Nature all Men are equal; therefore he has given Power to the People or Multitude.</HI> I leave him to untie that Knot if he can; but, as 'tis u&s;ual with Impo&s;tors, he goes about by Surmi&s;es to elude the Force of this Argument, pretending that in &s;ome other place he had contradict|ed him&s;elf, and acknowledg'd that every Man was Prince of his Po&s;teri|ty; <HI>becau&s;e that if many Men had bin created together, they ought all to have bin Princes of their Po&s;terity.</HI> But 'tis not nece&s;&s;ary to argue upon Pa&s;&s;ages

On the contrary, The &s;ame Law that gave to my Father a Power over me, gives me the like over my Children; and if I had a thou&s;and Brothers, each of them would have the &s;ame over their Children. <HI>Bellarmin</HI>'s Argument there|fore being no way enervated by the alledg'd Pa&s;&s;age, I may ju&s;tly in&s;i&s;t upon it, and add, That God has not only declar'd in Scripture, but written on the Heart of every Man, that as it is better to be cloth'd, than to go naked; to live in a Hou&s;e, than to lie in the Fields; to be defended by the united Force of a Multitude, than to place the hopes of his Security &s;olely in his own &s;trength; and to prefer the Benefits of Society, before a &s;a|vage and barbarous Solitude: he has al&s;o taught them to frame &s;uch So|cietys, and to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch Laws as were nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve them. And we may as rea&s;onably affirm, that Mankind is for ever oblig'd to u&s;e no other Clothes than leather Breeches, like <HI>Adam;</HI> to live in hollow Trees, and eat Acorns, or to &s;eek after the Model of his Hou&s;e for a Ha|bitation, and to u&s;e no Arms except &s;uch as were known to the Patriarchs; as to think all Nations for ever oblig'd to be govern'd as they govern'd their Familys. This I take to be the genuin &s;en&s;e of the Scripture, and the mo&s;t re&s;pectful way of interpreting the Places relating to our purpo&s;e. 'Tis hard to imagin, that God who has left all things to our choice, that are not evil in them&s;elves, &s;hould tie us up in this; and utterly incredible that he &s;hould impo&s;e upon us a nece&s;&s;ity of following his Will, without declaring it to us. In&s;tead of con&s;tituting a Government over his People, con&s;i&s;ting of many Parts, which we take to be a Model fit to be imitated by others, he might have declar'd in a word, That the elde&s;t Man of the elde&s;t Line &s;hould be King; and that his Will ought to be their Law. This had bin more &s;utable to the Goodne&s;s and Mercy of God, than to leave us in a dark Labyrinth, full of Precipices; or rather, to make the Government given to his own People, a fal&s;e Light to lead us to de&s;tructi|on. This could not be avoided, if there were &s;uch a thing as our Author calls a <HI>Lord Paramount over his Childrens Children to all Generations.</HI> We &s;ee nothing in Scripture, of Precept or Example, that is not utterly ab|horrent to this Chimera. The only &s;ort of Kings mention'd there with approbation, is &s;uch a one <HI>as may not rai&s;e his Heart above his Brethren.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 17.</NOTE> If God had con&s;tituted a Lord Paramount with an ab&s;olute Power, and mul|titudes of Nations were to labour and fight for his Greatne&s;s and Plea&s;ure, this were to rai&s;e his Heart to a height, that would make him forget he was a Man. Such as are vers'd in Scripture, not only know that it neither agrees with the Letter or Spirit of that Book; but that it is unrea|&s;onable in it &s;elf, unle&s;s he were of a Species different from the re&s;t of Mankind. His exaltation would not agree with God's Indulgence to his Creatures, tho he were the better for it; much le&s;s when probably he
<PB N="14" REF="22">
  would be made more unhappy, and wor&s;e, by the Pride, Luxury and other Vices, that always attend the highe&s;t Fortunes. 'Tis no le&s;s incre|dible that God, who di&s;po&s;es all things in Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s, and ap|points a due Place for all, &s;hould, without di&s;tinction, ordain &s;uch a Power, to every one &s;ucceeding in &s;uch a Line, as cannot be executed; the Wi&s;e would refu&s;e, and Fools cannot take upon 'em the burden of it, without ruin to them&s;elves, and &s;uch as are under them: or expo&s;e Man|kind to a multitude of other Ab&s;urditys and Mi&s;chiefs; &s;ubjecting the Aged to be govern'd by Children; the Wi&s;e to depend on the Will of Fools; the Strong and Valiant, to expect defence from the Weak or Cowardly; and all in general to receive Ju&s;tice from him, who neither knows nor cares for it.</P>

<P>IF any Man &s;ay, that we are not to &s;eek into the depth of God's Coun|&s;els; I an&s;wer, That if he had, for Rea&s;ons known only to him&s;elf, affix'd &s;uch a Right to any one Line, he would have &s;et a Mark upon tho&s;e who come of it, that Nations might know to whom they owe Sub|jection; or given &s;ome te&s;timony of his Pre&s;ence with <HI>Filmer</HI> and <HI>Heylin,</HI> if he had &s;ent them to reveal &s;o great a My&s;tery. Till that be done, we may &s;afely look upon them as the wor&s;t of Men, and teachers only of Lies and Follys. This per&s;uades me little, to examin what would have bin, if God had it once created many Men, or the Conclu&s;ions that can be drawn from <HI>Adam</HI>'s having bin alone. For nothing can be more evident than that if many had bin created, they had bin all equal, unle&s;s God had given a Preference to one. All their Sons had inherited the &s;ame Right after their death; and no Dream was ever more empty, than his Whim&s;y of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Kingdom, or that of the en&s;uing Patriarchs. To &s;ay the truth, 'tis hard to &s;peak &s;eriou&s;ly of <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Kingdom, or to think any Man to be in earne&s;t who mentions it. He was a Stranger, and a Pilgrim in the Land where he liv'd, and pretended to no Authority beyond his own Family, which con&s;i&s;ted only of a Wife and Slaves. He liv'd with <HI>Lot</HI> as with his Equal, and would have no Conte&s;t with him, becau&s;e they were Brethren. His Wife and Servants could neither make up, nor be any part of a Kingdom, in as much as the de&s;potical Government, both in Practice and Principle, differs from the Regal. If his Kingdom was to be grounded on the Paternal Right, it vani&s;h'd away of it &s;elf; he had no Child: <HI>Eliezer</HI> of <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> for want of a better, was to be his Heir: <HI>Lot,</HI> tho his Nephew, was excluded: He dur&s;t not own his own Wife: He had not one foot of Land, till he bought a Field for a burying-place: His three hundred and eighteen Men were Servants, (bought according to the cu&s;tom of tho&s;e days) or their Children; and the War he made with them, was like to <HI>Gideon</HI>'s Enterprize; which &s;hews only that God can &s;ave by a few as well as by many, but makes nothing to our Author's purpo&s;e. For if they had bin as many in number as the Army of <HI>Semira|mis,</HI> they could have no relation to the Regal, much le&s;s to the Paternal Power; for a Father dos not buy, but beget Children.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="23">
Notwith&s;tanding this, our Author be&s;tows the proud Title of Lord Pa|ramount   upon him, and tran&s;mits it to <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> who was indeed a King like his Father, great, admirable, and glorious in Wi&s;dom and Holine&s;s, but utterly void of all worldly &s;plendor or power. This &s;piritual Kingdom was inherited by <HI>Jacob,</HI> who&s;e Title to it was not founded on Prerogative of Birth, but Election and peculiar Grace; but he never enjoy'd any other worldly Inheritance, than the Field and Cave which <HI>Abraham</HI> had bought for a burying-place, and the Goods he had gain'd in <HI>Laban</HI>'s Service.</P>
<P>The Example of <HI>Judah</HI> his Sentence upon <HI>Thamar</HI> is yet farther from the purpo&s;e, if it be po&s;&s;ible; for he was then a Member of a privat Fa|mily, the fourth Son of a Father then living; neither in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, nor under the promi&s;e of the Privileges of Primogeniture, tho <HI>Ruben, Simeon</HI> and <HI>Levi</HI> fell from it by their Sins. What&s;oever therefore the Right was, which belong'd to the Head of the Family, it mu&s;t have bin in <HI>Jacob;</HI> but as he profe&s;t him&s;elf a keeper of Sheep, as his Fathers had bin, the exerci&s;e of that Employment was &s;o far from Regal, that it de&s;erves no explication. If that Act of <HI>Judah</HI> is to be imputed to a Royal Power, I have as much as I ask: He, tho living with his Father, and elder Bro|thers, when he came to be of Age to have Children, had the &s;ame Power over &s;uch, as were of, or came into his Family, as his Father had over him; for none can go beyond the Power of Life and Death: The &s;ame in the utmo&s;t extent, cannot at the &s;ame time equally belong to many. If it be divided equally, it is no more than that Univer&s;al Liberty which God has given to Mankind; and every Man is a King till he deve&s;ts him|&s;elf of his Right, in con&s;ideration of &s;omething that he thinks better for him.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VIII. <HI>Nimrod</HI> was the fir&s;t King, during the Life of <HI>Chu&s;h, Cham, Shem,</HI> and <HI>Noah.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Creation is exactly de&s;crib'd in the Scripture; but we know &s;o little of what pa&s;t between the fini&s;hing of it and the Flood, that our Author may &s;ay what he plea&s;es, and I may leave him to &s;eek his Proofs where he can find them. In the mean time I utterly deny, that any Power did remain in the Heads of Familys after the Flood, that dos in the lea&s;t degree re&s;emble the Regal in Principle or Practice. If in this I am mi&s;taken, &s;uch Power mu&s;t have bin in <HI>Noah,</HI> and tran&s;mitted to one of his Sons. The Scripture &s;ays only, that he built an Altar, &s;acri|fic'd to the Lord, was a Husbandman, planted a Vineyard, and per|form'd &s;uch Offices as bear nothing of the Image of a King, for the &s;pace of three hundred and fifty Years. We have rea&s;on to believe, that his Sons after his Death continu'd in the &s;ame manner of Life, and the Equality properly belonging to Brethren. 'Tis not ea&s;y to determin, whether <HI>Shem</HI> or <HI>Japhet</HI> were the Elder; but <HI>Ham</HI> is declar'd to be the younger: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 9.</NOTE>and <HI>Noah</HI>'s Ble&s;&s;ing to <HI>Shem</HI> &s;eems to be purely Prophetical and Spiritual, of what &s;hould be accompli&s;h'd in his Po&s;terity; with which <HI>Japhet</HI> &s;hould be per&s;uaded to join. If it had bin worldly, the whole Earth mu&s;t have bin brought under him, and have for ever continu'd in his Race, which never was accompli&s;h'd, otherwi&s;e than in the Spiritual Kingdom of
<PB N="16" REF="24">
  Chri&s;t, which relates not to our Author's Lord Paramount.</P>
<P>As to earthly Kings, the fir&s;t of 'em was <HI>Nimrod,</HI> the &s;ixth Son of <HI>Chu&s;h</HI> the Son of <HI>Ham, Noah</HI>'s younger and accur&s;ed Son. This Kingdom was &s;et up about a hundred and thirty Years after the Flood, whil&s;t <HI>Chu&s;h, Ham, Shem</HI> and <HI>Noah</HI> were yet living: whereas if there were any thing of Truth in our Author's Propo&s;ition, all Mankind mu&s;t have continu'd under the Government of <HI>Noah</HI> whil&s;t he liv'd; and that Power mu&s;t have bin tran&s;mitted to <HI>Shem,</HI> who liv'd about three hundred and &s;eventy Years after the erection of <HI>Nimrod</HI>'s Kingdom; and mu&s;t have come to <HI>Japhet</HI> if he was the Elder, but could never come to <HI>Cham,</HI> who is de|clar'd to have bin certainly the Younger, and condemn'd to be a Ser|vant to them both; much le&s;s to the younger Son of his Son, whil&s;t he, and tho&s;e to whom he and his Po&s;terity were to be Subjects, were &s;till living.</P>
<P>This Rule therefore, which the Partizans of Ab&s;olute Monarchy fancy to be univer&s;al and perpetual, falling out in its fir&s;t beginning, directly con|trary to what they a&s;&s;ert; and being never known to have bin recover'd, were enough to &s;ilence them, if they had any thing of mode&s;ty or regard to Truth. But the matter may be carried farther: For the Scripture not only te&s;tifys, that this Kingdom of <HI>Nimrod</HI> was an U&s;urpation, void of all Right, proceeding from the mo&s;t violent and mi&s;chievous Vices, but exercis'd with the utmo&s;t fury, that the mo&s;t wicked Man of the accur&s;ed Race, who &s;et him&s;elf up again&s;t God, and all that is good, could be capable of. The progre&s;s of this Kingdom was &s;utable to its In&s;titution: that which was begun in wickedne&s;s, was carried on with madne&s;s, and pro|duc'd Confu&s;ion. The mighty Hunter, whom the be&s;t Interpreters call a <HI>cruel Tyrant,</HI> receding from the &s;implicity and innocence of the Patriarchs, who were Husbandmen or Shepherds, arrogating to him&s;elf a Domi|nion over <HI>Shem,</HI> to whom he and his Fathers were to be Servants, did thereby &s;o peculiarly become the Heir of God's Cur&s;e, that what&s;oever has bin &s;aid to this day, of the Power that did mo&s;t directly &s;et it &s;elf again&s;t God and his People, has related literally to the <HI>Babel</HI> that he built, or figuratively to that which re&s;embles it in Pride, Cruelty, Inju&s;tice and Madne&s;s.</P>
<P>But the &s;hamele&s;s rage of &s;ome of the&s;e Writers is &s;uch, that they ra|ther chu&s;e to a&s;cribe the beginning of their Idol to this odious Violence, than to own it from the con&s;ent of a willing People; as if they thought, that as all Action mu&s;t be &s;utable to its Principle, &s;o that which is unju&s;t in its practice, ought to &s;corn to be deriv'd from that which is not dete&s;ta|ble in its principle. 'Tis hardly worth our pains to examin whether the Nations, that went from <HI>Babel</HI> after the confu&s;ion of Languages, were more or le&s;s than &s;eventy two, for they &s;eem not to have gone according to Familys, but every one to have a&s;&s;ociated him&s;elf to tho&s;e that un|der&s;tood his Speech; and the chief of the Fathers, as <HI>Noah</HI> and his Sons, were not there, or were &s;ubject to <HI>Nimrod;</HI> each of which Points doth de&s;troy, even in the Root, all pretence to Paternal Government. Be|&s;ides, 'tis evident in Scripture, that <HI>Noah</HI> liv'd three hundred and fifty Years after the Flood; <HI>Shem</HI> five hundred; <HI>Abraham</HI> was born about two hundred and ninety Years after the Flood, and liv'd one hundred &s;eventy five Years: He was therefore born under the Government of <HI>Noah,</HI> and died under that of <HI>Shem:</HI> He could not therefore exerci&s;e a regal Power whil&s;t he liv'd, for that was in <HI>Shem:</HI> So that in leaving his Country, and &s;etting up a Family for him&s;elf, that never acknowledg'd any Supe|rior, and never pretending to reign over any other, he fully &s;hew'd he
<PB N="17" REF="25">
thought him&s;elf free, and to owe &s;ubjection to none: And being as far   from arrogating to him&s;elf any Power upon the Title of Paternity, as from acknowledging it in any other, left every one to the &s;ame liberty.</P>
<P>The punctual enumeration of the Years that the Fathers of the holy Seed lived, gives us ground of making a more than probable conjecture, that they of the collateral Lines were, in number of days, not unequal to them; and if that be true, <HI>Ham</HI> and <HI>Chu&s;h</HI> were alive when <HI>Nimrod</HI> &s;et him&s;elf up to be King. He mu&s;t therefore have u&s;urp'd this Power over his Father, Grandfather, and great Grandfather; or, which is more probable, he turn'd into Violence and Oppre&s;&s;ion the Power given him by a Multi|tude; which, like a Flock without a Shepherd, not knowing whom to obey, &s;et him up to be their Chief. I leave to our Author the liberty of chu&s;ing which of the&s;e two dos be&s;t &s;ute with his Paternal Monarchy; but as far as I can under&s;tand, the fir&s;t is directly again&s;t it, as well as again&s;t the Laws of God and Man; the other being from the con&s;ent of the Mul|titude, cannot be extended farther than they would have it, nor turn'd to their prejudice, without the mo&s;t abominable ingratitude and treache|ry, from whence no Right can be deriv'd, nor any ju&s;tifiable Example taken.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, if our Author re&s;olve that <HI>Abraham</HI> was al&s;o a King, he mu&s;t pre&s;ume that <HI>Shem</HI> did emancipate him, before he went to &s;eek his Fortune. This was not a Kingly po&s;ture; but I will not contradict him, if I may know over whom he reign'd. Paternal Monarchy is exercis'd by the Father of the Family over his De&s;cendents, or &s;uch as had bin under the Dominion of him who&s;e Heir he is. But <HI>Abraham</HI> had neither of the&s;e: Tho&s;e of his neare&s;t Kindred continu'd in <HI>Me&s;opotamia,</HI> as ap|pears by what is &s;aid of <HI>Bethuel</HI> and <HI>Laban.</HI> He had only <HI>Lot</HI> with him, over whom he pretended no right: He had no Children till he was a hundred Years old, (that is to &s;ay, he was a King without a Subject) and then he had but one. I have heard that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><P>Omni&s;que pote&s;tas im|patiens con|&s;ortis erit.</P>
<P>Lucan.</P></NOTE> <HI>Sovereigns do impatiently bear Competitors;</HI> but now I find Subjection al&s;o doth admit of none. <HI>A|braham</HI>'s Kingdom was too great when he had two Children; and to di&s;|burden it, <HI>I&s;hmael</HI> mu&s;t be expel'd &s;oon a&s;ter the birth of <HI>I&s;aac.</HI> He ob|&s;erv'd the &s;ame method after the death of <HI>Sarah:</HI> He had Children by <HI>Keturah;</HI> but he gave them Gifts and &s;ent 'em away, leaving <HI>I&s;aac</HI> like a Stoical King reigning in and over him&s;elf, without any other Subject till the birth of <HI>Jacob</HI> and <HI>E&s;au.</HI> But his Kingdom was not to be of a larger extent than that of his Father: The two Twins could not agree: <HI>Jacob</HI> was &s;ent away by his Mother; he reign'd over <HI>E&s;au</HI> only, and 'tis not ea&s;y to determin who was the Heir of his worldly Kingdom; for tho <HI>Jacob</HI> had the birth-right, we do not find he had any other Goods than what he had gotten in <HI>Laban</HI>'s &s;ervice. If our Author &s;ay true, the right of Primogeniture, with the Dominion perpetually annex'd by the Laws of God and Nature, mu&s;t go to the elde&s;t: <HI>I&s;aac</HI> therefore, tho he had not bin deceiv'd, could not have con&s;er'd it upon the younger; for Man cannot overthrow what God and Nature have in&s;tituted. <HI>Jacob,</HI> in the Court-Language, had bin a double Rebel, in beguiling his Father, and &s;upplanting his Brother: The ble&s;&s;ing of being Lord over his Brethren, could not have taken place. Or if <HI>I&s;aac</HI> had Power, and his Act was good, the Prerogative of the Elder is not rooted in the Law of God or Nature, but is a matter of conveniency only, which may be chang'd at the Will of the Father, whether he know what he dos or not. But if this Paternal Right to Dominion were of any value, or Dominion over Men
<PB N="18" REF="26">
  were a thing to be de&s;ir'd; why did <HI>Abraham, I&s;aac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> content them&s;elves with &s;uch a narrow Territory, when after the death of their Ance&s;tors, they ought, according to that rule, to have bin Lords of the World? All Authors conclude that <HI>Shem</HI> was the elde&s;t by birth, or pre|fer'd by the appointment of God, &s;o as the Right mu&s;t have bin in him, and from him tran&s;mitted to <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>I&s;aac:</HI> but if they were &s;o po&s;|&s;e&s;t with the contemplation of a Heavenly Kingdom, as not to care for the greate&s;t on Earth; 'tis &s;trange that <HI>E&s;au,</HI> who&s;e mode&s;ty is not much commended, &s;hould &s;o far forget his Intere&s;t, as neither to lay claim to the Empire of the World, nor di&s;pute with his Brother the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Field and Cave bought by <HI>Abraham,</HI> but rather to fight for a dwel|ling on Mount <HI>Seir,</HI> that was neither po&s;&s;e&s;t by, nor promis'd to his Fa|thers. If he was fallen from his Right, <HI>Jacob</HI> might have claim'd it; but God was his Inheritance, and being a&s;&s;ur'd of his Ble&s;&s;ing, he contented him&s;elf with what he could gain by his Indu&s;try, in a way that was not at all &s;utable to the Pomp and Maje&s;ty of a King.

<HEAD>SECT. IX. The Power of a Father belongs only to a Father.</HEAD>
<P>THIS leads us to an ea&s;y determination of the Que&s;tion, which our Author thinks in&s;oluble; <HI>If</HI> Adam <HI>was Lord of his Children, he dos not &s;ee how any can be free from the &s;ubjection of his Parents.</HI> For as no good Man will ever de&s;ire to be free from the re&s;pect that is due to his Father, who did beget and educate him, no wi&s;e Man will ever think the like to be due to his Brother or Nephew that did neither. If <HI>E&s;au</HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI> were equally free; if <HI>Noah,</HI> as our Author affirms, divided <HI>Europe, A&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> among&s;t his three Sons, tho he can't prove it; and if &s;e|venty two Nations under &s;o many Heads or Kings went from <HI>Babylon</HI> to people the Earth, about a hundred and thirty years after the Flood, I know not why, according to the &s;ame rule and proportion, it may not be &s;afely concluded, that in four thou&s;and years Kings are &s;o multiplied, as to be in number equal to the Men that are in the World; that is to &s;ay, they are, according to the Laws of God and Nature, all free, and inde|pendent upon each other, as <HI>Shem, Ham,</HI> and <HI>Japhet</HI> were. And there|fore, tho <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Noah</HI> had reign'd alone when there were no Men in the World except &s;uch as i&s;&s;u'd from them, that is no rea&s;on why any o|ther &s;hould reign over tho&s;e that he has not begotten. As the Right of <HI>Noah</HI> was divided among&s;t the Children he le&s;t, and when he was dead, no one of them depended on the other, becau&s;e no one of them was Fa|ther of the other; and the Right of a Father can only belong to him that is &s;o, the like mu&s;t for ever attend every other Father in the World. This paternal Power mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily accrue to every Father: He is a King by the &s;ame Right as the Sons of <HI>Noah;</HI> and how numerous &s;oever Familys may be upon the increa&s;e of Mankind, they are all free, till they agree

<P>REASON leads them to this: No one Man or Family is able to provide that which is requi&s;ite for their convenience or &s;ecurity, whil&s;t every one has an equal Right to every thing, and none acknow|ledges a Superior to determin the Controver&s;ys, that upon &s;uch occa&s;ions mu&s;t continually ari&s;e, and will probably be &s;o many and great, that Man|kind cannot bear them.

Some &s;mall numbers of Men, living within the Pre|cincts of one City, have, as it were, ca&s;t into a common Stock, the Right which they had of governing them&s;elves and Children; and by common Con&s;ent joining in one body, exercis'd &s;uch Power over every &s;ingle Per&s;on as &s;eem'd beneficial to the whole: and this Men call perfect <HI>Democracy.</HI> Others cho&s;e rather to be govern'd by a &s;elect number of &s;uch as mo&s;t excell'd in Wi&s;dom and Vertue; and this, according to the &s;ig|nification of the word, was call'd <HI>Ari&s;tocracy:</HI> Or when one Man excell'd all others, the Government was put into his hands under the name of <HI>Mo|narchy.</HI> But the wi&s;e&s;t, be&s;t, and far the greate&s;t part of Mankind, re|jecting the&s;e &s;imple Species, did form Governments mix'd or compos'd of the three, as &s;hall be prov'd hereafter, which commonly receiv'd their re&s;pective Denomination from the Part that prevail'd, and did de&s;erve prai&s;e or blame, as they were well or ill proportion'd.</P>
<P>It were a &s;olly hereupon to &s;ay, that the Liberty for which we contend, is of no u&s;e to us, &s;ince we cannot endure the Solitude, Barbarity, Weak|ne&s;s, Want, Mi&s;ery and Dangers that accompany it whil&s;t we live alone, nor can enter into a Society without re&s;igning it; for the choice of that So|ciety, and the liberty of framing it according to our own Wills, for our own good, is all we &s;eek. This remains to us whil&s;t we &s;orm Govern|ments, that we our &s;elves are Judges how far 'tis good for us to recede &s;rom our natural Liberty; which is of &s;o great importance, that from thence only we can know whether we are Freemen or Slaves: and the difference between the be&s;t Government and the wor&s;t, dos wholly de|pend upon a right or wrong exerci&s;e of that Power. If Men are naturally free, &s;uch as have Wi&s;dom and Under&s;tanding will always frame good Governments: But if they are born under the nece&s;&s;ity of a perpetual Slavery, no Wi&s;dom can be of u&s;e to them; but all mu&s;t for ever depend on the Will of their Lords, how cruel, mad, proud or wicked &s;oever they be.</P>

<HEAD>  SECT. XI. No Man comes to command many, unle&s;s by Con&s;ent or by Force.</HEAD>
<P>BUT becau&s;e I cannot believe God has created Man in &s;uch a &s;tate of Mi&s;ery and Slavery as I ju&s;t now mention'd; by di&s;covering the vanity of our Author's whim&s;ical Patriarchical Kingdom, I am led to a certain conclu&s;ion, That every Father of a Family is free and exempt from the domination of any other, as the &s;eventy two that went from <HI>Babel</HI> were. 'Tis hard to comprehend how one Man can come to be ma&s;ter of many, equal to him&s;elf in Right, unle&s;s it be by Con&s;ent or by Force. If by Con&s;ent, we are at an end of our Controver&s;ys: Governments, and the Magi&s;trats that execute them, are created by Man. They who give a being to them, cannot but have a right of regulating, limiting and di|recting them as be&s;t plea&s;es them&s;elves; and all our Author's A&s;&s;ertions concerning the ab&s;olute Power of one Man, fall to the ground: If by Force, we are to examin how it can be po&s;&s;ible or ju&s;tifiable. This &s;ub|duing by Force we call Conque&s;t; but as he that forces mu&s;t be &s;tronger than tho&s;e that are forc'd, to talk of one Man who in &s;trength exceeds many millions of Men, is to go beyond the extravagance of Fables and Romances. This Wound is not cur'd by &s;aying, that he fir&s;t conquers one, and then more, and with their help others: for as to matter of fact, the fir&s;t news we hear of <HI>Nimrod</HI> is, that he reign'd over a great multi|tude, and built va&s;t Citys; and we know of no Kingdom in the World, that did not begin with a greater number than any one Man could po&s;&s;ibly &s;ubdue. If they who chu&s;e one to be their Head, did under his conduct &s;ubdue others, they were Fellow-conquerors with him; and nothing can be more bruti&s;h, than to think, that by their Vertue and Valour they had purchas'd perpetual Slavery to them&s;elves and their Po&s;terity. But if it were po&s;&s;ible, it could not be ju&s;tifiable; and whil&s;t our Di&s;pute is con|cerning Right, that which ought not to be is no more to be receiv'd, than if it could not be. No Right can come by conque&s;t, unle&s;s there were a Right of making that Conque&s;t, which, by rea&s;on of the Equality that our Author confe&s;&s;es to have bin among&s;t the Heads of Familys, and as I have prov'd goes into Infinity, can never be on the Aggre&s;&s;or's &s;ide. No Man can ju&s;tly impo&s;e any thing upon tho&s;e who owe him nothing. Our Author therefore, who <HI>a&s;cribes the enlargement of</HI> Nimrod<HI>'s Kingdom to &V;&s;urpation and Tyranny,</HI> might as well have acknowledg'd the &s;ame in the beginning, as he &s;ays all other Authors have done. However, he ought not to have imputed to Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> an Approbation of his Right, as Lord or King over his Family; &s;or he could never think him to be a Lord by the right of a Father, who by that rule mu&s;t have liv'd and died a Slave to his Fathers that overliv'd him. Who&s;oever therefore like <HI>Nim|rod</HI> grounds his preten&s;ions of Right upon U&s;urpation and Tyranny, de|clares him&s;elf to be, like <HI>Nimrod,</HI> a U&s;urper and a Tyrant, that is, an Enemy to God and Man, and to have no Right at all. That which was unju&s;t in its beginning, can of it &s;elf never change its nature. <HI>Tempus in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e,</HI> &s;aith <HI>Grotius, nullam habet vim effectricem.</HI> He that per&s;i&s;ts in doing Inju&s;tice, aggravates it, and takes upon him&s;elf all the guilt of his Prede|ce&s;&s;ors. But if there be a King in the World, that claims a Right by Con|que&s;t,

and would ju&s;tify it, he might do well to tell whom he conquer'd,   when, with what a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and upon what rea&s;on he undertook the War: for he can ground no title upon the ob&s;curity of an un&s;earchable antiquity; and if he dos it not, he ought to be look'd upon as a u&s;urping <HI>Nimrod.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SECT. XII. The pretended Paternal Right is divi&s;ible or indivi&s;ible: if divi&s;ible, 'tis extingui&s;h'd; if indivi&s;ible, univer&s;al.</HEAD>
<P>THis paternal right to Regality, if there be any thing in it, is divi&s;i|ble or indivi&s;ible; if indivi&s;ible, as <HI>Adam</HI> has but one Heir, one Man is rightly Lord of the whole World, and neither <HI>Nimrod</HI> nor any of his Succe&s;&s;ors could ever have bin Kings, nor the &s;eventy two that went from <HI>Babylon: Noah</HI> &s;urviv'd him near two hundred years: <HI>Shem</HI> continu'd one hundred and fifty years longer. The Dominion mu&s;t have bin in him, and by him tran&s;mitted to his Po&s;terity for ever. Tho&s;e that call them&s;elves Kings in all other Nations, &s;et them&s;elves up again&s;t the Law of God and Nature: This is the Man we are to &s;eek out, that we may yield obedience to him. I know not where to find him; but he mu&s;t be of the race of <HI>Abraham. Shem</HI> was prefer'd before his Brethren: The Inheritance that could not be divided mu&s;t come to him, and from him to <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> who was the fir&s;t of his De&s;cendents that outliv'd him. 'Tis pity that <HI>Jacob</HI> did not know this, and that the Lord of all the Earth, thro ignorance of his Title, &s;hould be forc'd to keep one of his Subjects Sheep for wages; and &s;trange, that he who had wit enough to &s;upplant his Bro|ther, did &s;o little under&s;tand his own bargain, as not to know that he had bought the perpetual Empire of the World. If in con&s;cience he could not take &s;uch a price for a di&s;h of Pottage, it mu&s;t remain in <HI>E&s;au:</HI> How|ever our Lord Paramount mu&s;t come from <HI>I&s;aac.</HI> If the Deed of Sale made by <HI>E&s;au</HI> be good, we mu&s;t &s;eek him among&s;t the <HI>Jews;</HI> if he could not &s;o ea&s;ily deve&s;t him&s;elf of his Right, it mu&s;t remain among&s;t his De&s;cendents, who are <HI>Turks.</HI> We need not &s;cruple the reception of either, &s;ince the late <HI>Scots</HI> Act tells us, <HI>That Kings derive their Royal Power from God alone; and no difference of Religion, &amp;c. can divert the right of Succe&s;&s;ion.</HI> But I know not what we &s;hall do, if we cannot find this Man; for <HI>de non appa|rentibus &amp; non exi&s;tentibus eadem e&s;t ratio.</HI> The Right mu&s;t fall if there be none to inherit: If we do not know who he is that has the Right, we do not know who is near to him: All Mankind mu&s;t inherit the Right, to which every one has an equal title; and that which is Dominion, if in one, when 'tis equally divided among all Men, is that univer&s;al Liberty which I a&s;&s;ert. Wherefore I leave it to the choice of &s;uch as have inhe|rited our Author's opinions, to produce this <HI>Jew</HI> or <HI>Turk</HI> that ought to be Lord of the whole Earth, or to prove a better title in &s;ome other Per&s;on, and to per&s;uade all the Princes and Nations of the World to &s;ubmit: If this be not done, it mu&s;t be confe&s;t this Paternal Right is a mere whim|&s;ical Fiction, and that no Man by birth has a Right above another, or can have any, unle&s;s by the conce&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e who are concern'd.</P>
<P>If this Right to an univer&s;al Empire be divi&s;ible, and <HI>Noah</HI> did actually divide it among his three Sons: if &s;eventy and two ab&s;olute Monarchs
<PB N="22" REF="30">
  did at once ari&s;e out of the Multitude that had a&s;&s;embl'd at <HI>Babel; Noah,</HI> nor his Sons, nor any of the holy Seed, nor probably any elder than <HI>Nim|rod</HI> having bin there; many other Monarchs mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have ari&s;en from them al&s;o. <HI>Abraham,</HI> as our Author &s;ays, was a King: <HI>Lot</HI> mu&s;t have bin &s;o al&s;o; for they were equals: his Sons <HI>Ammon</HI> and <HI>Moab</HI> had no dependence upon the De&s;cendents of <HI>Abraham: I&s;mael</HI> and <HI>E&s;au</HI> &s;et up for them&s;elves, and great Nations came of them: <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Sons by <HI>Ke|turah</HI> did &s;o al&s;o; that is to &s;ay, every one as &s;oon as he came to be of age to provide for him&s;elf, did &s;o, without retaining any dependence upon the Stock from whence he came: Tho&s;e of that Stock, or the Head of it, pretended to no Right over tho&s;e who went from them. Nay, nearne&s;s in Blood was &s;o little regarded, that tho <HI>Lot</HI> was <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Brother's Son, <HI>Eliezer</HI> his Servant had bin his Heir, if he had died childle&s;s. The like continu'd among <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Sons; no Juri&s;diction was given to one above the re&s;t: an equal divi&s;ion of Land was made among&s;t 'em: Their Judges and Magi&s;trats were of &s;everal Tribes and Familys, without any other preference of one before another, than what did ari&s;e from the advantages God had given to any particular Per&s;on. This I take to be a proof of the utmo&s;t extent and certainty, that the Equality among&s;t Mankind was then perfect: He therefore that will deny it to be &s;o now, ought to prove that neither the Prophets, Patriarchs, or any other Men did ever under|&s;tand or regard the Law deliver'd by God and Nature to Mankind; or that having bin common and free at the fir&s;t, and &s;o continu'd for many hundreds of years after the Flood, it was afterwards aboli&s;h'd, and a new one introduc'd. He that a&s;&s;erts this mu&s;t prove it; but till it dos appear to us, when, where, how, and by whom this was done, we may &s;afely believe there is no &s;uch thing; and that no Man is or can be a Lord among&s;t us, till we make him &s;o; and that by nature we are all Brethren.</P>
<P>Our Author, by endeavouring farther to illu&s;trate the Patriarchical Power, de&s;troys it, and cannot deny to any Man the Right which he ac|knowledges to have bin in <HI>I&s;mael</HI> and <HI>E&s;au.</HI> But if every Man has a Right of &s;etting up for him&s;elf with his Family, or before he has any, he cannot but have a right of joining with others if he plea&s;es; as his joining or not joining with others, and the choice of tho&s;e others depends upon his own will, he cannot but have a right of judging upon what conditions 'tis good for him to enter into &s;uch a Society, as mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily hinder him from exerci&s;ing the Right which he has originally in him&s;elf. But as it cannot be imagin'd that Men &s;hould generally put &s;uch Fetters upon them&s;elves, unle&s;s it were in expectation of a greater good thereby to accrue to them, no more can be requir'd to prove that they do voluntarily enter into the&s;e Societys, in&s;titute them for their own good, and pre&s;cribe &s;uch Rules and Forms to them as be&s;t plea&s;e them&s;elves, without giving account to any. But if every Man be free, till he enter into &s;uch a Society as he chu&s;es for his own good, and tho&s;e Societys may regulate them&s;elves as they think &s;it; no more can be requir'd to prove the natural Equality in which all Men are born, and continue, till they re&s;ign it as into a common &s;tock, in &s;uch mea&s;ure as they think fit for the con&s;tituting of Societys for their own good, which I a&s;&s;ert, and our Author denies.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XIII.   There was no &s;hadow of a Paternal Kingdom amongst the Hebrews, nor precept for it.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author is &s;o mode&s;t to confe&s;s, that <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Kingdom, con&s;i&s;t|ing of &s;eventy two Per&s;ons, was &s;wallow'd up by the power of the greater Monarch <HI>Pharaoh:</HI> But if this was an Act of Tyranny, 'tis &s;trange that the &s;acred and eternal Right, grounded upon the immutable Laws of God and Nature, &s;hould not be re&s;tor'd to God's cho&s;en People, when he deliver'd them from that Tyranny. Why was not <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Mo|narchy confer'd upon his right Heir? How came the People to neglect a Point of &s;uch importance? Or if they did forget it, why did not <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> put 'em in mind of it? Why did not <HI>Jacob</HI> declare to whom it did belong? Or if he is under&s;tood to have declar'd it, in &s;aying the Scepter &s;hould not depart &s;rom <HI>Judah,</HI> why was it not deliver'd into his hands, or into his Heirs? If he was hard to be found in a People of one kindred, but four degrees remov'd from <HI>Jacob</HI> their Head, who were exact in ob&s;erving Ge|nealogys; how can we hope to find him after &s;o many thou&s;and years, when we do not &s;o much as know from whom we are deriv'd? Or rather how comes that Right, which is eternal and univer&s;al, to have bin nip'd in the bud, and &s;o aboli&s;h'd before it could take any effect in the World, as never to have bin heard of among&s;t the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> nor the People of God, either before or after the Captivity, from the death of <HI>Jacob</HI> to this day? This I a&s;&s;ert, and I give up the Cau&s;e if I do not prove it. To this end I begin with <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> the fir&s;t Rulers of the People, who were nei|ther of the elde&s;t Tribe according to birth, nor the di&s;po&s;ition of <HI>Jacob,</HI> if he did, or could give it to any; nor were they of the elde&s;t Line of their own Tribe: and even between them the Superiority was given to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> who was the younger; as 'tis &s;aid, <HI>I have made thee a God to</HI> Pharaoh, <HI>and</HI> Aaron <HI>thy Brother &s;hall be thy Prophet.</HI> If <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was a King, as our Au|thor &s;ays, but I deny, and &s;hall hereafter prove, the matter is wor&s;e: He mu&s;t have bin an U&s;urper of a mo&s;t unju&s;t Dominion over his Bre|thren; and this Patriarchical power, which by the Law of God was to be perpetually fix'd in his De&s;cendents, peri&s;h'd with him, and his Sons con|tinu'd in an ob&s;cure rank among&s;t the Levites. <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> of the Tribe of <HI>Ephraim</HI> &s;ucceeded him; <HI>Othniel</HI> was of <HI>Judah, Ehud</HI> of <HI>Benjamin, Barak</HI> of <HI>Napthalim,</HI> and <HI>Gideon</HI> of <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh.</HI> The other Judges were of &s;eve|ral Tribes; and they being dead, their Children lay hid among the com|mon People, and we hear no more of 'em. The fir&s;t King was taken out of the lea&s;t Family of the lea&s;t and younge&s;t Tribe. The &s;econd, whil&s;t the Children of the fir&s;t King were yet alive, was the younge&s;t of eight Sons of an ob&s;cure Man in the Tribe of <HI>Judah: Solomon</HI> one of his younge&s;t Sons &s;ucceeded him: Ten Tribes de&s;erted <HI>Rehoboam,</HI> and by the command of God &s;et up <HI>Joroboam</HI> to be their King. The Kingdom of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> by the de&s;truction of one Family pa&s;s'd into another: That of <HI>Ju|dah</HI> by God's peculiar promi&s;e continu'd in <HI>David</HI>'s race till the Captivity; but we know not that the elde&s;t Son was always prefer'd, and have no rea&s;on to pre&s;ume it. <HI>David</HI> their mo&s;t reverenced King left no precept &s;or it, and gave an example to the contrary: he did not &s;et up the Elde&s;t,
<PB N="24" REF="32">
  but the Wi&s;e&s;t. After the Captivity, they who had mo&s;t wi&s;dom or va|lour to defend the People, were thought mo&s;t fit to command; and the Kingdom at the la&s;t came to the <HI>A&s;monean</HI> Race, whil&s;t the Po&s;terity of <HI>David</HI> was buried in the ma&s;s of the common People, and utterly depriv'd of all worldly Rule or Glory. If the Judges had not a Regal Power, or the Regal were only ju&s;t, as in&s;tituted by God, and eternally annex'd to Paternity, all that they did was evil: There could be nothing of Ju&s;tice in the Powers exercis'd by <HI>Mo&s;es, Jo&s;hua, Gideon, Samuel,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Judges. If the Power was regal and ju&s;t, it mu&s;t have continu'd in the De&s;cendents of the fir&s;t: <HI>Saul, David,</HI> and <HI>Solomon</HI> could never have bin Kings: The Right failing in them, their De&s;cendents could in|herit none from them; and the others after the Captivity were guilty of the like inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Now as the Rule is not general, to which there is any one ju&s;t excep|tion, there is not one of the&s;e Examples that would not overthrow our Author's Doctrin: If one deviation from it were lawful, another might be, and &s;o to infinity. But the utmo&s;t degree of impudent madne&s;s to which perhaps any Man in the world has ever arriv'd, is to a&s;&s;ert that to be univer&s;al and perpetual, which cannot be verify'd by any one Example to have bin in any place of the World, nor ju&s;tify'd by any Precept.</P>
<P>If it be objected, That all the&s;e things were done by God's immediat di&s;po&s;ition: I an&s;wer, that it were an impious madne&s;s to believe that God did perpetually &s;end his Prophets to overthrow what he had ordain'd from the beginning, and as it were in &s;pite to bring the minds of Men into inextricable confu&s;ion and darkne&s;s; and by particular Commands to over|throw his univer&s;al and eternal Law. But to render this point more clear, I de&s;ire it may be con&s;ider'd, That we have but three ways of di|&s;tingui&s;hing between good and evil.</P>
<P>1. When God by his Word reveals it to us.</P>
<P>2. When by his Deeds he declares it; becau&s;e that which he dos is good, as that which he &s;ays is true.</P>
<P>3. By the Light of Rea&s;on, which is good, in as much as it is from God.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t; It cannot be &s;aid we have an explicit word for that conti|nuance of the Power in the elde&s;t; for it appears not, and having none, we might conclude it to be le&s;t to our liberty: For it agrees not with the goodne&s;s of God to leave us in a perpetual ignorance of his Will in a mat|ter of &s;o great importance, nor to have &s;uffer'd his own People, or any other, to per&s;i&s;t, without the lea&s;t reproof or admonition, in a perpetual oppo&s;ition to it, if it had di&s;pleas'd him.</P>
<P>To the 2<HI>d.</HI> The Di&s;pen&s;ations of his Providence, which are the ema|nations of his Will, have gone contrary to this pretended Law: There can therefore be no &s;uch thing; for God is con&s;tant to him&s;elf: his Works do not contradict his Word, and both of them do equally declare to us that which is good.</P>
<P>Thirdly; If there be any Precept that by the light of Nature we can in matters of this kind look upon as certain, 'tis that the Government of a People &s;hould be given to him that can be&s;t perform the Dutys of it: No Man has it &s;or him&s;elf, or from him&s;el&s;; but for and from tho&s;e who be|fore he had it were his Equals, that he may do good to them. If there were a Man, who in Wi&s;dom, Valour, Ju&s;tice and Purity, &s;urpa&s;s'd all others, he might be call'd a King by Nature, becau&s;e he is be&s;t able to bear the weight of &s;o great a charge; and like a good Shepherd to lead the People to good. <HI>Detur digniori</HI> is the voice of Rea&s;on and that we may
<PB N="25" REF="33">
be &s;ure <HI>Detur &s;eniori</HI> is not &s;o, <HI>Solomon</HI> tells us, <HI>That a wi&s;e Child is better than an old and fooli&s;h King.</HI> But if this pretended Right do not belong to him that is truly the elde&s;t, nothing can be more ab&s;urd than a fanta&s;tical pretence to a Right deduc'd from him that is not &s;o. Now le&s;t I &s;hould be thought to follow my own Inventions, and call them Rea&s;on, or the Light of God in us, I de&s;ire it may be ob&s;erv'd that God him&s;elf has ever taken this method. When he rais'd up <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to be the leader of his Peo|ple, he endow'd him with the mo&s;t admirable gifts of his Spirit that ever he be&s;tow'd upon a Man: When he cho&s;e &s;eventy Men to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, he endow'd them with the &s;ame &s;pirit. <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> had no other title to &s;ucceed him than the like evidence of God's Pre&s;ence with him. When the Peo|ple thro &s;in fell into mi&s;ery, he did not &s;eek out their De&s;cendents, nor &s;uch as boa&s;ted in a prerogative of Birth; but &s;hew'd whom he de&s;ign'd for their Deliverer, by be&s;towing &s;uch gifts upon him as were requir'd for the performance of his work; and never fail'd of doing this, till that mi&s;erable &s;inful People rejecting God and his Government, de&s;ir'd that which was in u&s;e among their accur&s;ed Neighbours, that they might be as like to them in the mo&s;t &s;hameful Slavery to Man, as in the Wor&s;hip of Idols &s;et up again&s;t God.</P>
<P>But if this pretended Right be grounded upon no word or work of God, not the rea&s;on of Man, 'tis to be accounted a mere figment, that has no|thing of truth in it.</P>

But I may go far|ther, and affirm, that tho there had bin &s;uch a Right in the fir&s;t Fathers of Mankind exercis'd by them, and for &s;ome ages individually tran&s;mitted to their elde&s;t Sons, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily peri&s;h, &s;ince the Generations of Men are &s;o confus'd, that no Man knows his own original, and con&s;e|quently this Heir is no where to be found; for 'tis a folly for a Man to pretend to an Inheritance, who cannot prove him&s;elf to be the right Heir. If this be not true, I de&s;ire to know from which of <HI>Noah</HI>'s Sons the Kings of <HI>England, France,</HI> or <HI>Spain</HI> do deduce their original; or what rea&s;on they can give why the title to Dominion, which is fancied to be in <HI>Noah,</HI> did rather belong to the fir&s;t of their re&s;pective Races, that attain'd to the Crowns they now enjoy, than to the meane&s;t Pea&s;ant of their Kingdoms; or how that can be tran&s;mitted to them, which was not in the fir&s;t. We know that no Man can give what he has not; that if there be no giver,
<PB N="26" REF="34">
  there is no gift; if there be no root, there can be no branch; and that the fir&s;t point failing, all that &s;hould be deriv'd from it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily fail.</P>
<P><HI>Our Author, who is good at re&s;olving difficultys, &s;hews us an ea&s;y way out of this &s;trait.</HI> 'Tis true, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> all Kings are not natural Parents of their Subjects; yet they either are, or are to be reputed the next Heirs to tho&s;e fir&s;t Progenitors, who were at fir&s;t the natural Parents of the whole People, and in their right &s;ucceed to the exerci&s;e of the &s;upreme Juri&s;diction: and &s;uch Heirs are not only Lords of their own Children, but al&s;o of their Brethren, and all tho&s;e that were &s;ubject to their Father, &amp;c. By this means it comes to pa&s;s, that many a Child &s;ucceeding a King, hath the right of a Father over many a grey-headed multitude, and hath the title of <HI>Pater Patriae.</HI></P>
<P>An A&s;&s;ertion comprehending &s;o many Points, upon which the mo&s;t important Rights of all Mankind do depend, might de&s;erve &s;ome proof: But he being of opinion we ought to take it upon his credit, dos not vouch|&s;afe to give us &s;o much as the &s;hadow of any. Neverthele&s;s being un|willing either crudely to receive, or ra&s;hly to reject it, I &s;hall take the li|berty of examining the Propo&s;ition, and hope I may be pardon'd, if I dwell a little more than ordinarily upon that which is the foundation of his Work.</P>
<P>We are beholden to him for confe&s;&s;ing mode&s;tly that all Kings are not the natural Fathers of their People, and &s;paring us the pains of proving, that the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> who reign'd from the <HI>Indies</HI> to the <HI>Helle&s;pont,</HI> did not beget all the Men that liv'd in tho&s;e Countrys; or that the Kings of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> who began to reign before they were five years old, were not the natural Fathers of the Nations under them. But if all Kings are not Fathers, none are, as they are Kings: If any one is, or ever was, the Rights of Paternity belong to him, and to no other who is not &s;o al&s;o. This mu&s;t be made evident; for matters of &s;uch importance require proof, and ought not to be taken upon &s;uppo&s;ition. If <HI>Filmer</HI> therefore will pre|tend that the right of Father belongs to any one King, he mu&s;t prove that he is the Father of his People; for otherwi&s;e it dos not appertain to him: he is not the Man we &s;eek.</P>
<P>'Tis no le&s;s ab&s;urd to &s;ay he is to be reputed Heir to the fir&s;t Progenitor: for it mu&s;t be fir&s;t prov'd, that the Nation did de&s;cend from one &s;ingle Progenitor without mixture of other races: That this Progenitor was the Man, to whom <HI>Noah</HI> (according to <HI>Filmer</HI>'s whim&s;ical divi&s;ion of <HI>A&s;ia, Europe,</HI> and <HI>Africa</HI> among his Sons) did give the Land now inhabited by that People: That this Divi&s;ion &s;o made was not capable of Subdivi&s;ions; and that this Man is by a true and uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion de&s;cended from the fir&s;t and elde&s;t Line of that Progenitor: and all fails, if every one of the&s;e points be not made good. If there never was any &s;uch Man who had that Right, it cannot be inherited from him. If by the &s;ame rule that a parcel of the World was allotted to him, that parcel might be &s;ubdivided among&s;t his Children as they increas'd, the &s;ubdivi&s;ions may be infinite, and the right of Dominion thereby de&s;troy'd. If &s;everal Na|tions inhabit the &s;ame Land, they owe obedience to &s;everal Fathers: that which is due to their true Father, cannot be render'd to him that is not &s;o; for he would by that means be depriv'd of the Right which is in|&s;eparably annex'd to his Per&s;on: And la&s;tly, what&s;oever the Right of an Heir may be, it can belong only to him that is Heir.</P>
<P>Le&s;t any &s;hould be &s;educ'd from the&s;e plain Truths by frivolous &s;ug|ge&s;tions, 'tis good to con&s;ider that the title of <HI>Pater Patriae,</HI> with which our Author would cheat us, has no relation to the matters of Right, upon
<PB N="27" REF="35">
which we di&s;pute. 'Tis a figurative &s;peech, that may have bin rightly   enough applied to &s;ome excellent Princes on account of their care and love to their People, re&s;embling that of a Father to his Children; and can relate to none but tho&s;e who had it. No man that had common &s;en&s;e, or valu'd truth, did ever call <HI>Phalaris, Diony&s;ius, Nabis, Nero,</HI> or <HI>Caligula,</HI> Fathers of their Countrys; but Mon&s;ters, that to the utmo&s;t of their power endeavour'd their de&s;truction: which is enough to prove, that &s;acred Name cannot be given to all, and in con&s;equence to none but &s;uch, as by their Virtue, Piety, and good Government do de&s;erve it.</P>
<P>The&s;e matters will yet appear more evident, if it be con&s;ider'd, that tho <HI>Noah</HI> had reign'd as a King; that <HI>Zoroa&s;ter,</HI> as &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e, was <HI>Ham,</HI> who reign'd over his Children, and that thereby &s;ome Right might perhaps be deriv'd to &s;uch as &s;ucceeded them; yet this can have no influ|ence upon &s;uch as have not the like Original: and no man is to be pre|&s;um'd to have it, till it be prov'd, &s;ince we have prov'd that many had it not. If <HI>Nimrod</HI> &s;et him&s;elf up again&s;t his Grandfather; and if <HI>Ninus,</HI> who was de&s;cended from him in the fifth Generation, &s;lew him, they ill de&s;erv'd the name and rights of Fathers; and none, but tho&s;e who have renounc'd all Humanity, Virtue, and common Sen&s;e, can give it to them, or their Succe&s;&s;ors. If therefore <HI>Noah</HI> and <HI>Shem</HI> had not &s;o much as the &s;hadow of Regal Power, and the actions of <HI>Nimrod, Ninus,</HI> and others who were Kings in their times, &s;hew they did not reign in the right of Fathers, but were &s;et up in a direct oppo&s;ition to it, the titles of the fir&s;t Kings were not from Paternity, nor con&s;i&s;tent with it.</P>
<P>Our Author therefore, who &s;hould have prov'd every point, dos nei|ther prove any one, nor a&s;&s;ert that which is agreeable to divine or human Story, as to matter of fact; and as little conformable to common &s;en&s;e. It dos not only appear contrary to his general Propo&s;ition, That all Go|vernments have not begun with the Paternal Power; but we do not find that any ever did. They who according to his rules &s;hould have bin Lords of the whole Earth, liv'd and died private men, whil&s;t the mo&s;t wicked and boi&s;terous of their Children commanded the greate&s;t part of the then inhabited World, not excepting even tho&s;e Countrys where they &s;pent and ended their days; and in&s;tead of entring upon the Government by the right of Fathers, or managing it as Fathers, they did by the mo&s;t outrageous inju&s;tice u&s;urp a violent Domination over their Brethren and Fathers.</P>
<P>It may ea&s;ily be imagin'd what the Right is that could be thus acquir'd, and tran&s;mitted to their Succe&s;&s;ors. Neverthele&s;s our Author &s;ays, <HI>All Kings either are, or ought to be reputed next Heirs,</HI> &amp;c. But why reputed, if they are not? How could any of the accur&s;ed race of <HI>Ham</HI> be reputed Father of <HI>Noah</HI> or <HI>Shem,</HI> to whom he was to be a Servant? How could <HI>Nimrod</HI> and <HI>Ninus</HI> be reputed Fathers of <HI>Ham,</HI> and of tho&s;e whom they ought to have obey'd? Can Rea&s;on oblige me to believe that which I know to be fal&s;e? Can a Lie, that is hateful to God and good Men, not only be excus'd, but enjoin'd, when (as he will perhaps &s;ay) it is for the King's Service? Can I &s;erve two Ma&s;ters, or, without the mo&s;t unpar|donable inju&s;tice, repute him to be my Father, who is not my Father; and pay the obedience due to him who did beget and educate me, to one from whom I never receiv'd any good? If this be &s;o ab&s;urd, that no man dares affirm it in the per&s;on of any, 'tis as prepo&s;terous in relation to his Heirs: For <HI>Nimrod</HI> the fir&s;t King could be Heir to no man as King, and could tran&s;mit to no man a Right which he had not. If it was ridiculous
<PB N="28" REF="36">
  and abominable to &s;ay that he was Father of <HI>Chu&s;h, Ham, Shem</HI> and <HI>Noah;</HI> 'tis as ridiculous to &s;ay, he had the Right of Father, if he was not their Father; or that his Succe&s;&s;ors inherited it from him, if he never had it. If there be any way thro this, it mu&s;t have accru'd to him by the extirpa|tion of all his Elders, and their Races; &s;o as he who will a&s;&s;ert this pre|tended Right to have bin in the <HI>Babylonian</HI> Kings, mu&s;t a&s;&s;ert, that <HI>Noah, Shem, Japhet, Ham, Chu&s;h,</HI> and all <HI>Nimrod</HI>'s elder Brothers, with all their De&s;cendents, were utterly extirpated before he began to reign, and all Mankind to be de&s;cended from him.</P>
<P>This mu&s;t be, if <HI>Nimrod,</HI> as the Scripture &s;ays, was the fir&s;t that be|came mighty in the Earth; unle&s;s men might be Kings, without having more Power than others: for <HI>Chu&s;h, Ham</HI> and <HI>Noah</HI> were his Elders and Progenitors in the direct Line, and all the Sons of <HI>Shem</HI> and <HI>Japhet,</HI> and their De&s;cendents in the Collaterals, were to be prefer'd before him; and he could have no Right at all that was not directly contrary to tho&s;e Prin|ciples which, our Author &s;ays, are grounded upon the eternal and indi&s;|pen&s;able Laws of God and Nature. The like may be &s;aid of the &s;eventy two Heads of Colonys, which (following, as I &s;uppo&s;e, Sir <HI>Walter Ra|leigh)</HI> he &s;ays went out to people the Earth, and whom he calls Kings: for according to the &s;ame Rule, <HI>Noah, Shem</HI> and <HI>Japhet,</HI> with their De&s;cen|dents, could not be of the number; &s;o that neither <HI>Nimrod,</HI> nor the o|thers that e&s;tabli&s;h'd the Kingdoms of the World, and from whence he thinks all the re&s;t to be deriv'd, could have any thing of Ju&s;tice in them, unle&s;s it were from a Root altogether incon&s;i&s;tent with his Principles. They are therefore fal&s;e, or the E&s;tabli&s;hments beforemention'd could have no Right. If they had none, they cannot be reputed to have any; for no man can think that to be true, which he knows to be fal&s;e: having none, they could tran&s;mit none to their Heirs and Succe&s;&s;ors. And if we are to believe, that all the Kingdoms of the Earth are e&s;tabli&s;h'd upon this Paternal Right; it mu&s;t be prov'd that all tho&s;e, who in birth ought to have bin prefer'd before <HI>Nimrod,</HI> and the &s;eventy two, were extirpat|ed; or that the fir&s;t and true Heir of <HI>Noah</HI> did afterwards aboli&s;h all the&s;e unju&s;t U&s;urpations; and making him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the whole, left it to his Heirs, in whom it continues to this day. When this is done, I will acknowledg the Foundation to be well laid, and admit of all that can be rightly built upon it; but if this fails, all fails: The poi&s;on of the Root continues in the Branches. If the right Heir be not in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he is not the right who is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: If the true Heir be known, he ought to be re&s;tor'd to his Right: If he be not known, the Right mu&s;t peri&s;h: For nothing can be &s;aid to belong to any man, if no man knows to whom it belongs, and can have no more effect than if it were not. This conclu|&s;ion will continue unmovable, tho the divi&s;ion into &s;eventy two Kingdoms were allow'd; which cannot be without de&s;troying the Paternal Power, or &s;ubjecting it to be &s;ubdivided into as many parcels as there are men, which de&s;troys Regality; for the &s;ame thing may be requir'd in every one of the di&s;tinct Kingdoms, and others deriv'd from them. Or we mu&s;t know who was that true Heir of <HI>Noah,</HI> that recover'd all: How, when, and to whom he gave the &s;everal Portions; and that every one of them do continue in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e, who by this prerogative of Birth are rais'd above the re&s;t of mankind: and if they are not, 'tis an impious folly to repute them &s;o, to the prejudice of tho&s;e that are; and if they do not appear, to the prejudice of all mankind; who being equal, are thereby made &s;ubject to them. For as Truth is the Rule of Ju&s;tice;

there can be none, when he is reputed &s;uperior to all who is certainly in|ferior   to</P>
<P>[In this place two Pages are wanting in the Original Manu&s;cript.]</P>
<P>&mdash;degenerated from that Rea&s;on which di&s;tingui&s;hes men from bea&s;ts. Tho it may be fit to u&s;e &s;ome Ceremonys before a man be admitted to practi&s;e Phy&s;ick, or &s;et up a Trade, 'tis his own Skill that makes him a Doctor or an Artificer, and others do but declare it. An A&s;s will not leave his &s;tupidity, tho he be cover'd with Scarlet; and he that is by na|ture a Slave, will be &s;o &s;till, tho a Crown be put upon his Head: and 'tis hard to imagin a more violent inver&s;ion of the Laws of God and Nature, than to rai&s;e him to the Throne, whom Nature intended for the Chain; or to make them Slaves to Slaves, whom God has endow'd with the Virtues requir'd in Kings. Nothing can be more prepo&s;terous, than to impute to God the frantick Domination, which is often exercis'd by wicked, fooli&s;h and vile Per&s;ons, over the wi&s;e, valiant, ju&s;t and good; or to &s;ubject the be&s;t to the rage of the wor&s;t. If there be any Family therefore in the world, that can by the Law of God and Nature, di&s;tinct from the Ordinance of Man, pretend to an hereditary Right of Domi|nion over any People, it mu&s;t be one that never did, and never can pro|duce any Per&s;on that is not free from all the Infirmitys and Vices that ren|der him unable to exerci&s;e the Sovereign Power; and is endow'd with all the Virtues requir'd to that end; or at lea&s;t a Promi&s;e from God, verify'd by Experience, that the next in Blood &s;hall ever be able and fit for that work. But &s;ince we do not know that any &s;uch has yet appear'd in the World, we have no rea&s;on to believe that there is, or ever was any &s;uch; and con&s;equently none upon whom God has confer'd the Rights that can|not be exercis'd without them.</P>
<P>If there was no &s;hadow of a Paternal Right in the In&s;titution of the Kingdoms of <HI>Saul</HI> and <HI>David,</HI> there could be none in tho&s;e that &s;ucceeded. <HI>Rehoboam</HI> could have no other than from <HI>Solomon:</HI> When he reign'd over two Tribes, and <HI>Jeroboam</HI> over ten, 'tis not po&s;&s;ible that both of 'em could be the next Heir of their la&s;t common Father <HI>Jacob;</HI> and 'tis ab&s;urd to &s;ay, that ought to be reputed which is impo&s;&s;ible: for our thoughts are ever to be guided by Truth, or &s;uch an appearance of it, as dos per|&s;uade or convince us.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Title of Father is yet more ridiculou&s;ly or odiou&s;ly apply'd to the &s;ucceeding Kings. <HI>Baa&s;ha</HI> had no other Title to the Crown, than by killing <HI>Nadab</HI> the Son of <HI>Jeroboam,</HI> and de&s;troying his Family. <HI>Zimri</HI> purchas'd the &s;ame honour by the &s;laughter of <HI>Elah</HI> when he was drunk, and dealing with the Hou&s;e of <HI>Baa&s;ha,</HI> as he had done with that of <HI>Jero|boam. Zimri</HI> burning him&s;elf, transfer'd the &s;ame to <HI>Omri,</HI> as a reward for bringing him to that extremity. As <HI>Jehu</HI> was more fierce than the&s;e, he &s;eems to have gain'd a more excellent recompence than any &s;ince <HI>Jero|boam,</HI> even a conditional Promi&s;e of a perpetual Kingdom; but falling from the&s;e glorious Privileges, purchas'd by his Zeal in killing two wick|ed Kings, and above one hundred of their Brethren, <HI>Shallum</HI> mu&s;t have inherited them, by de&s;troying <HI>Zachary</HI> and all that remain'd of his Race. This in plain Engli&s;h is no le&s;s than to &s;ay, that who&s;oever kills a King, and invades a Crown, tho the act and means of accompli&s;hing it be never &s;o dete&s;table, dos thereby become Father of his Country, and Heir of all the Divine Privileges annex'd to that glorious Inheritance. And tho

  I cannot tell whether &s;uch a Doctrin be more &s;otti&s;h, mon&s;trous or im|pious, I dare affirm, that if it were receiv'd, no King in the World could think him&s;elf &s;afe in his Throne for one day: They are already encom|pa&s;t with many dangers; but le&s;t Pride, Avarice, Ambition, Lu&s;t, Rage, and all the Vices that u&s;ually reign in the hearts of worldly men, &s;hould not be &s;ufficient to invite 'em perpetually to di&s;turb Mankind, thro the de&s;ire of gaining the Power, Riches and Splendor that accompa|ny a Crown, our Author propo&s;es to 'em the mo&s;t &s;acred Privileges, as a reward of the mo&s;t execrable Crimes. He that was &s;tir'd up only by the violence of his own Nature, thought that a Kingdom could never be bought at too dear a rate;

But if the &s;acred Character of God's Anointed or Vicegerent, and Father of a Country, were added to the other Advantages that follow the high|e&s;t Fortunes; the mo&s;t mode&s;t and ju&s;t men would be fill'd with fury, that they might attain to them.

This is a Doctrin worthy of <HI>Filmer</HI>'s Invention, and <HI>Heylin</HI>'s Approbation; which being well weigh'd, will &s;hew to all good and ju&s;t Kings how far they are oblig'd to tho&s;e, who under pretence of advancing their Authority, fill the minds of men with &s;uch Notions as are &s;o de&s;peratly pernicious to them.</P>

<P>IF the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> who&s;e Lawgiver was God, had no King in the fir&s;t In&s;titution of their Government, 'tis no wonder that other Nations &s;hould not think them&s;elves oblig'd to &s;et up any: if they who came all of one &s;tock, and knew their Genealogys, when they did in&s;titute Kings, had no regard to our Author's Chimerical right of Inheritance, nor were taught by God or his Prophets to have any; 'tis not &s;trange that Nations, who did not know their own Original, and who probably, if not cer|tainly, came of &s;everal Stocks, never put them&s;elves to the trouble of &s;eek|ing one, who by his birth de&s;erv'd to be prefer'd before others: and va|rious Changes happening in all Kingdoms (whereby in proce&s;s of time the Crowns were tran&s;ported into divers Familys, to which the Right of Inheritance could not without the utmo&s;t impiety and madne&s;s be im|puted) &s;uch a fancy certainly could only enter into the heads of Fools; and we know of none &s;o fooli&s;h to have harbour'd it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grecians,</HI> among&s;t others who follow'd the Light of Rea&s;on, knew no other original Title to the Government of a Nation, than that Wi&s;|dom,

The&s;e   Qualitys gave beginning to tho&s;e Governments, which we call <HI>Heroum Regna;</HI> and the Veneration paid to &s;uch as enjoy'd them, proceeded from a grateful &s;en&s;e of the Good receiv'd from them: They were thought to be de&s;cended from the Gods, who in Vertue and Beneficence &s;urpa&s;s'd other men: The &s;ame attended their De&s;cendents, till they came to abu&s;e their Power, and by their Vices &s;hew'd them&s;elves like to, or wor&s;e than others. Tho&s;e Nations did not &s;eek the mo&s;t antient, but the mo&s;t worthy; and thought &s;uch only worthy to be prefer'd before others, who could be&s;t perform their Duty. The <HI>Spartans</HI> knew that <HI>Hercules</HI> and <HI>Achilles</HI> were not their Fathers, for they were a Nation before either of them were born; but thinking their Children might be like to them in Valour, they brought them from <HI>Thebes</HI> and <HI>Epirus</HI> to be their Kings.

We know not that ever they had any Children; but we are &s;ure they could not be Fathers of the People that flock'd to them from &s;everal places, nor in any manner be reputed Heirs of him or them that were &s;o: for they never knew who was their own Father; and when their Mother came to be di&s;cover'd, they ought to have bin Subjects to <HI>Amulius</HI> or <HI>Numitor.</HI> They could not be his Heirs whil&s;t he liv'd, and were not when he died: The Government of the <HI>Latins</HI> continu'd at <HI>Alba,</HI> and <HI>Romulus</HI> reign'd over tho&s;e who join'd with him in building <HI>Rome.</HI> The Power not coming to him by Inheritance, mu&s;t have bin gain'd by Force, or confer'd upon him by Con&s;ent: It could not be acquir'd by Force; for one Man could not force a multitude of fierce and valiant men, as they appear to have bin.

If the Regal Power, which our Author &s;ays was in the Con&s;uls, could be divided into two parts, limited to a Year, and &s;uffer &s;uch re&s;trictions as the People pleas'd to lay upon it, they might have divided it into as many parcels, and put it in|to &s;uch form, as be&s;t &s;uted with their Inclinations; and the &s;everal Ma|gi&s;tracys which they did create for the exerci&s;e of the Kingly, and all other Powers, &s;hews they were to give account to none but them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The <HI>I&s;raelites, Spartans, Romans</HI> and others, who thus fram'd their Governments according to their own Will, did it not by any peculiar Pri|viledg, but by a univer&s;al Right confer'd upon them by God and Nature: They were made of no better Clay than others: They had no Right, that dos not as well belong to other Nations; that is to &s;ay, The Con&s;ti|tion of every Government is refer'd to tho&s;e who are concern'd in it, and no other has any thing to do with it.</P>
<P>Yet if it be a&s;&s;erted, that the Goverment of <HI>Rome</HI> was Paternal, or they had none at all; I de&s;ire to know, how they came to have &s;ix Fathers of &s;everal Familys, whil&s;t they liv'd under Kings; and two or more new ones every Year afterwards: Or how they came to be &s;o excellent in Vertue and Fortune, as to conquer the be&s;t part of the World, if they had no Government. <HI>Hobbs</HI> indeed dos &s;currilou&s;ly deride <HI>Cicero, Plato</HI> and <HI>Ari|&s;totle, Caetero&s;&abque; Romanae &amp; Graecae Anarchiae fautores.</HI> But 'tis &s;trange that this Anarchy, which he re&s;embles to a Chaos, full of darkne&s;s and confu&s;ion, that can have no Strength or regular Action, &s;hould overthrow all the Monarchys that came within their reach, <HI>If</HI> (as our Authors &s;ays) <HI>the be&s;t order, greate&s;t &s;trength, and mo&s;t &s;tability be in them.</HI> It mu&s;t therefore be confe&s;t, that the&s;e Governments are, in their various Forms, rightly in&s;tituted by &s;everal Nations, without any regard to Inhe|ritance; or that the&s;e Nations have had no Governments, and were more &s;trong, vertuous and happy without Government, than under it, which is mo&s;t ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>But if Governments ari&s;e from the Con&s;ent of Men, and are in&s;tituted by Men according to their own Inclinations, they do therein &s;eek their own Good; for the Will is ever drawn by &s;ome real Good, or the appearance of it. This is that which man &s;eeks by all the regular or irregular mo|tions of his mind: Rea&s;on and Pa&s;&s;ion, Vertue and Vice do herein con|cur, tho they differ va&s;tly in the Objects, in which each of 'em thinks this Good to con&s;i&s;t. A People therefore that &s;ets up Kings, Dictators, Con&s;uls, Pretors or Emperors, dos it not, that they may be great, glo|rious, rich or happy, but that it may be well with them&s;elves and their Po&s;terity. This is not accompli&s;h'd &s;imply by &s;etting one, a few, or more men in the admini&s;tration of Powers, but by placing the Authority in tho&s;e who may rightly perform their Office. This is not every man's Work: Valour, Integrity, Wi&s;dom, Indu&s;try, Experience and Skill, are requir'd for the management of tho&s;e Military and Civil Affairs that nece&s;&s;arily fall under the care of the chief Magi&s;trats.

<P><HI>Marius, Sylla, Catiline, Julius</HI> or <HI>Octavius Cae&s;ar,</HI> and all tho&s;e who by force or fraud u&s;urp'd a Dominion over their Brethren, could have no Title to this Right; much le&s;s could they become Fathers of the People,
<PB N="33" REF="41">
by u&s;ing all the mo&s;t wicked means that could well be imagin'd to de&s;troy   them; and not being regularly cho&s;en for their Vertues, or the opinion of them, nor prefer'd on account of any Prerogative that had bin from the beginning annex'd to their Familys, they could have no other Right than Occupation could confer upon them. If this can confer a Right, there is an end of all Di&s;putes concerning the Laws of God or Man. If <HI>Julius</HI> and <HI>Octavius Cae&s;ar</HI> did &s;ucce&s;&s;ively become Lords and Fathers of their Country, by &s;laughtering almo&s;t all the Senat, and &s;uch Per&s;ons as were eminent for Nobility or Vertue, together with the greater part of the People, it cannot be denied, that a Thief, who breaks into his Neighbour's Hou&s;e, and kills him, is ju&s;tly Ma&s;ter of his E&s;tate; and may exact the &s;ame obedience from his Children, that they render'd to their Father. If this Right could be transfer'd to <HI>Tiberius,</HI> either thro the malice of <HI>Octavius,</HI> or the fraud of his Wife; a wet Blanket laid over his face, and a few corrupted Soldiers could inve&s;t <HI>Caligula</HI> with the &s;ame. A vile Ra&s;cal pulling <HI>Claudius</HI> out by the heels from behind the Hangings where he had hid him&s;elf, could give it to him. A di&s;h of Mu&s;hrooms well &s;ea&s;on'd by the infamous Strumpet his Wife, and a Potion prepar'd for <HI>Britannicus</HI> by <HI>Locu&s;ta,</HI> could transfer it to her Son, who was a &s;tran|ger to his Blood. <HI>Galba</HI> became Heir to it, by driving <HI>Nero</HI> to de&s;pair and death. Two common Soldiers by exciting his Guards to kill him, could give a ju&s;t Tittle to the Empire of the World to <HI>Otho,</HI> who was thought to be the wor&s;t man in it. If a Company of Villains in the <HI>German</HI> Ar|my, thinking it as fit for them as others to create a Father of Mankind, could con&s;er the Dignity upon <HI>Vitellius;</HI> and if <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian,</HI> cau&s;ing him to be kill'd, and thrown into a Jakes le&s;s impure than his Life, did inherit all the glorious and &s;acred Privileges belonging to that Title, 'tis in vain to inquire after any man's right to any thing.</P>
<P>But if there be &s;uch a thing as Right or Wrong to be examin'd by men, and any Rules &s;et, whereby the one may be di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the other; the&s;e Extravagancys can have no effect of Right. Such as commit 'em, are not to be look'd upon as Fathers, but as the mo&s;t mortal Enemys of their re&s;pective Countrys. No Right is to be acknowledg'd in any, but &s;uch as is confer'd upon them by tho&s;e who have the right of conferring, and are concern'd in the exerci&s;e of the Power, upon &s;uch conditions as be&s;t plea&s;e them&s;elves. No Obedience can be due to him or them, who have not a right of commanding; which cannot rea&s;onably be confer'd upon any, that are not e&s;teem'd willing and able rightly to execute it. This ability to perform the highe&s;t Works that come within the reach of Men; and integrity of Will not to be diverted from it by any temptati|on, or con&s;ideration of privat Advantages, comprehending all that is mo&s;t commendable in Man; we may ea&s;ily &s;ee, that when&s;oever men act according to the Law of their own Nature, which is Rea&s;on, they can have no other rule to direct them in advancing one above another, than the opinion of a man's Vertue and Ability, be&s;t to perform the Duty in|cumbent upon him; that is, by all means to procure the good of the Peo|ple committed to his charge.

<HEAD>SECT. XVII. God having given the Government of the World to no one Man, nor de|clar'd how it &s;hould be divided, left it to the VVill of Man.</HEAD>
<P><HI>OUR Author's next Inquiry is,</HI> What becomes of the Right of Father|hood, in ca&s;e the Crown &s;hould e&s;cheat for want of an Heir? Whether it doth not e&s;cheat to the People? <HI>His an&s;wer is,</HI> 'Tis but the negligence or ignorance of the People, to lo&s;e the knowledg of the true Heir, &amp;c. <HI>And a little below,</HI> The Power is not devolv'd to the Multitude: No; the Kingly Power e&s;cheats on independent Heads of Familys: All &s;uch prime Heads have Power to con&s;ent in the uniting, or conferring their Fatherly Right of Sove|reign Authority on whom they plea&s;e; and he that is &s;o elected, claims not his Power as a Donative from the People, but as being &s;ub&s;tituted by God, from whom he receives his Royal Charter of Univer&s;al Father, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In my opinion, before he had ask'd, What &s;hould be done in ca&s;e the Crown &s;hould e&s;cheat for want of an Heir? he ought to have prov'd, there had bin a Man in the world, who had the Right in him&s;elf, and telling who he was, have &s;hew'd how it had bin tran&s;mitted for &s;ome Generations, that we might know where to &s;eek his Heir: and before he accus'd the Multitude of ignorance or negligence, in not knowing this Heir, he ought to have inform'd us, how it may be po&s;&s;ible to know him, or what it would avail us if we did know him; for 'tis in vain to know to whom a Right belongs, that never was, and never can be executed. But we may go farther, and affirm, that as the Univer&s;al Right mu&s;t have bin in <HI>Noah</HI> and <HI>Shem</HI> (if in any) who never exercis'd it; we have rea&s;on to believe there never was any &s;uch thing: And having prov'd from Scripture and Human Hi&s;tory, That the fir&s;t Kingdoms were &s;et up in a direct oppo&s;ition to this Right, by <HI>Nimrod</HI> and others, he that &s;hould &s;eek and find their Heirs, would only find tho&s;e, who by a mo&s;t accur&s;ed Wickedne&s;s, had u&s;urp'd and continu'd a Dominion over their Fathers,
<PB N="36" REF="44">
  contrary to the Laws of God and Nature; and we &s;hould neither be more wi&s;e, nor more happy than we are, tho our Author &s;hould furni&s;h us with certain and authentick Genealogys, by which we might know the true Heirs of <HI>Nimrod,</HI> and the &s;eventy two Kings that went from <HI>Babylon,</HI> who, as he &s;uppo&s;es, gave beginning to all the Kingdoms of the Earth.</P>
<P>Moreover, if the Right be Univer&s;al, it mu&s;t be in one; for the World being butone, the whole Right of commanding it cannot at the &s;ame time be in many, and proceed from the Ordinance of God, or of Man. It cannot proceed from the Ordinance of God; for he dos nothing in vain: He never gave a Right that could not be executed. No man can govern that which he dos not &s;o much as know: No man did ever know all the World; no man therefore did or could govern it: and none could be ap|pointed by God to do that which is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to be done; for it could not con&s;i&s;t with his Wi&s;dom. We find this in our &s;elves. It were a &s;hame for one of us poor, weak, &s;hort-&s;ighted Creatures, in the di&s;po|&s;al of our Affairs, to appoint &s;uch a method, as were utterly ineffectual for the Pre&s;ervation of our Familys, or de&s;tructive to them; and the bla&s;phemy of imputing to God &s;uch an Ordinance as would be a reproach to one of us, can &s;ute only with the wicked and impudent Fury of &s;uch as our Author, who delights in Mon&s;ters. This al&s;o &s;hews us that it can|not be from Men: One, or a few, may commit Follys, but Mankind dos not univer&s;ally commit, and perpetually per&s;i&s;t in any: They cannot therefore, by a general and permanent Authority, enact that which is ut|terly ab&s;urd and impo&s;&s;ible; or if they do, they de&s;troy their own Nature, and can no longer de&s;erve the Name of rea&s;onable Creatures. There can be therefore no &s;uch man; and the Folly of &s;eeking him, or his Heir that never was, may be left to the Di&s;ciples of <HI>Filmer.</HI></P>
<P>The Difficultys are as great, if it be &s;aid, The World might be divi|ded into parcels, and we are to &s;eek the Heirs of the fir&s;t Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors; for be&s;ides that no man can be oblig'd to &s;eek that which cannot be found, (all men knowing that <HI>Caligino&s;a nocte haec premit Deus)</HI> and that the Genealogys of Mankind are &s;o confus'd, that, unle&s;s po&s;&s;ibly among the <HI>Jews,</HI> we have rea&s;on to believe there is not a man in the world who knows his own Original, it could be of no advantage to us tho we knew that of every one; for the Divi&s;ion would be of no value, unle&s;s it were at the fir&s;t rightly made by him who had all the Authority in him&s;elf, (which dos no where appear) and rightly deduc'd to him, who, accor|ding to that divi&s;ion, claims a right to the Parcel he enjoys. And I fear our Author would terribly &s;hake the Crowns, in which the Nations of <HI>Europe</HI> are concern'd, if they &s;hould be per&s;uaded to &s;earch into the Ge|nealogys of their Princes, and to judg of their Rights according to the proofs they &s;hould give of Titles rightly deduc'd by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Blood from the &s;eventy two fir&s;t Kings, from whom our Author fancys all the Kingdoms of the World to be deriv'd.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, tho this were done, it would be to no purpo&s;e; for the &s;eventy two were not &s;ent out by <HI>Noah,</HI> nor was he or his Sons of that number; but they went, or were &s;ent, from <HI>Babylon</HI> where <HI>Nimrod</HI> reign'd, who, as has bin already prov'd, neither had, nor could have any right at all, but was a mighty Hunter, even a proud and cruel Tyrant, u&s;urping a Power to which he had no right, and which was perpetually exercis'd by him and his Succe&s;&s;ors again&s;t God and his People. From whence I may &s;afely conclude, That no right can ever be deriv'd; and may ju&s;tly pre&s;ume
<PB N="37" REF="45">
it will be denied by none who are of better Morals, and of more &s;ound   Principles in matters of Law and Religion than <HI>Filmer</HI> and <HI>Heylin;</HI> &s;ince 'tis no le&s;s ab&s;urd to deduce a right from him that had none, than to ex|pect pure and whole&s;om Waters from a filthy, polluted, and poi&s;onous Fountain.</P>
<P>If it be pretended that &s;ome other man &s;ince <HI>Noah</HI> had this univer&s;al Right, it mu&s;t either remain in one &s;ingle per&s;on as his right Heir, or be divided. If in one, I de&s;ire to know who he is, and where we may find him, that the Empire of the World may be deliver'd to him. But if he cannot be found, the bu&s;ine&s;s is at an end: for every man in the World may pretend him&s;elf to be the per&s;on; and the infinite controver&s;ys ari|&s;ing thereupon can never be decided, unle&s;s either the Genealogys of eve|ry one from <HI>Noah</HI> were extant and prov'd, or we had a Word from Heaven, with a &s;ufficient te&s;timony of his mi&s;&s;ion who announces it. When this is done, 'twill be time to con&s;ider what kind of obedience is due to this wonderfully happy and glorious Per&s;on. But whil&s;t the fir&s;t appears to be ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible, and we have no promi&s;e or rea&s;on to expect the other, the Propo&s;ition is to be e&s;teem'd one of our Author's empty whim&s;ys, which cannot be receiv'd by mankind, unle&s;s they come all to be po&s;&s;e&s;t with an Epidemical madne&s;s, which would ca&s;t them into that which <HI>Hobbs</HI> calls <HI>Bellum omnium contra omnes;</HI> when eve|ry man's Sword would be drawn again&s;t every man, if God &s;hould &s;o abandon the World to &s;uffer them to fall into &s;uch mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>If this pretended Right be divided, it concerns us to know by whom, when, how, and to whom: for the divi&s;ion cannot be of any value, unle&s;s the Right was originally in one; that he did exerci&s;e this Right in making the divi&s;ion; that the parcels into which the World is divided are ac|cording to the allotment made; and that the Per&s;ons claiming them by virtue of it are the true Heirs of tho&s;e to whom they were fir&s;t granted.

<P>But if the Dominion of the whole World cannot belong to any one man, and every one has an equal title to that which &s;hould give it; or if it did belong to one, none did ever exerci&s;e it in governing the whole, or dividing it; or if he did divide it, no man knows how, when, and to whom; &s;o that they who lay claim to any parcels can give no te&s;ti|mony of that divi&s;ion, nor &s;hew any better title than other men deriv'd from his fir&s;t Progenitor, to whom 'tis &s;aid to have bin granted; and that we have neither a Word, nor the promi&s;e of a Word from God to decide the controver&s;ys ari&s;ing thereupon, nor any Prophet giving te&s;timony of his mi&s;&s;ion that takes upon him to do it, the whole Fabrick of our Au|thor's Patriarchical Dominion falls to the ground; and they who propo&s;e the&s;e Doctrins, which (if they were receiv'd) would be a root of perpetu|al and reconcilable hatred in every man again&s;t every man, can be accoun|ted no le&s;s than Mini&s;ters of the Devil, tho they want the abilitys he has &s;ometimes infus'd into tho&s;e who have bin imploy'd upon the like occa&s;i|ons.

  and continue in greater or le&s;&s;er Societys, as be&s;t plea&s;es our &s;elves: The right of Paternity as to Dominion is at an end, and no more remains, but the love, veneration, and obedience, which proceeding from a due &s;en&s;e of the benefits of Birth and Education, have their root in Gratitude, and are e&s;teem'd &s;acred and inviolable by all that are &s;ober and vertuous. And as 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to transfer the&s;e Benefits by inheritance, &s;o 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to transfer the Rights ari&s;ing from them. No man can be my Father but he that did beget me; and 'tis as ab&s;urd to &s;ay I owe that Duty to one who is not my Father, which I owe to my Father, as to &s;ay, he did beget me, who did not beget me; for the obligation that ari&s;es from benefits can only be to him that confer'd them. 'Tis in vain to &s;ay the &s;ame is due to his Heir; for that can take place only when he has but one, which in this ca&s;e &s;ignifies nothing: For if I being the only Son of my Father, inherit his Right, and have the &s;ame power over my Children as he had over me; if I had one hundred Brothers, they mu&s;t all inherit the &s;ame; and the Law of <HI>England,</HI> which acknowledges one only Heir, is not ge|neral, but municipal, and is &s;o far from being general, as the precept of God and Nature, that I doubt whether it was ever known or us'd in any Nation of the World beyond our I&s;land. The words of the Apo&s;tle, <HI>If we are Children, we are therefore Heirs and Co-heirs with Chri&s;t,</HI> are the voice of God and Nature; and as the univer&s;al Law of God and Nature is al|ways the &s;ame, every one of us who have Children, have the &s;ame Right over them, as <HI>Abraham, I&s;aac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI> had over theirs; and that Right which was not devolv'd to any one of them, but inherited by them all (I mean the right of Father as Father) not the peculiar promi&s;es, which were not according to the Law of Nature, but the election of Grace, is al&s;o inherited by every one of us, and ours, that is, by all Mankind. But if that which could be inherited was inherited by all, and it be impo&s;&s;ible that a right of Dominion over all can be due to every one, then all that is or can be inherited by every one is that exemption from the Dominion of another, which we call Liberty, and is the gift of God and Nature.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XVIII. If a right of Dominion were e&s;teem'd Hereditary according to the Law of Nature, a multitude of de&s;tructive and inextricable Controver&s;ys would thereupon ari&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>THere being no &s;uch thing therefore, according to the Law of Na|ture, as an Hereditary Right to the Dominion of the World, or any part of it; nor any one man that can derive to him&s;elf a title from the fir&s;t Fathers of Mankind, by which he can rightly pretend to be pre|fer'd before others to that command, or a part of it; and none can be de|riv'd from <HI>Nimrod,</HI> or other U&s;urpers, who had none in them&s;elves, we may ju&s;tly &s;pare our pains of &s;eeking farther into this matter. But as things of the highe&s;t importance can never be too fully explain'd; it may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, That if Mankind could be brought to believe that &s;uch a right of Dominion were by the Law of God and Nature here|ditary, a great number of the mo&s;t de&s;tructive and inextricable Contro|ver&s;ys mu&s;t thereupon ari&s;e, which the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of God can

never enjoin, and Nature, which is Rea&s;on, can never intend; but at   pre&s;ent I &s;hall only mention two, from whence others mu&s;t perpetually &s;pring. Fir&s;t if there be &s;uch a Law, no Human Con&s;titution can alter it; no length of time can be a defence again&s;t it: All Governments that are not conformable to it are vicious and void even in their root, and mu&s;t be &s;o for ever: That which is originally unju&s;t may be ju&s;tly overthrown. We do not know of any (at lea&s;t in that part of the World in which we are mo&s;t concern'd) that is e&s;tabli&s;h'd, or exercis'd with an ab&s;olute Pow|er, as by the Authors of tho&s;e opinions is e&s;teem'd in&s;eparable from it: Many, as the Empire, and other States, are directly contrary; and on that account can have no Ju&s;tice in them. It being certain therefore that he or they who exerci&s;e tho&s;e Governments have no right: that there is a Man to whom it dos belong, and no man knowing who he is, there is no one man who has not as good a title to it as any other: There is not there|fore one who has not a right, as well as any, to overthrow that which has none at all. He that has no part in the Government may de&s;troy it, as well as he that has the greate&s;t; for he neither has that which God or|dain'd he &s;hould have, nor can &s;hew a title to that which he enjoys from that original Prerogative of Birth, from whence it can only be deriv'd.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid, that &s;ome Governments are arbitrary, as they ought to be; and <HI>France, Turkey,</HI> and the like be alledg'd as in&s;tances, the matter is not mended: for we do not only know when tho&s;e, who de&s;erve to be re|garded by us, were not ab&s;olute, and how they came to be &s;o; but al&s;o, that tho&s;e very Familys which are now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion are not of very long continuance, had no more title to the original right we &s;peak of than any other men, and con&s;equently can have none to this day. And tho we cannot perhaps &s;ay that the Governments of the barbarous Ea&s;tern Na|tions were ever other than they are, yet the known Original of them deprives them of all pretence to the Patriarchical Inheritance; and they may be as ju&s;tly as any other depriv'd of the Power to which they have no title.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd place, tho all mens Genealogys were extant, and ful|ly verifi'd, and it were allow'd that the Dominion of the World, or eve|ry part of it, did belong to the right Heir of the fir&s;t Progenitor, or any other to whom the fir&s;t did rightly a&s;&s;ign the Parcel, which is under que&s;tion; yet it were impo&s;&s;ible for us to know who &s;hould be e&s;teem'd the true Heir, or according to what rule he &s;hould be judg'd &s;o to be: for God has not by a preci&s;e word determin'd it, and Men cannot agree a|bout it, as appears by the various Laws and Cu&s;toms of &s;everal Nations, di&s;po&s;ing &s;everally of Hereditary Dominions.</P>
<P>'Tis a folly to &s;ay, they ought to go to the next in blood; for 'tis not known who is that next. Some give the preference to him who among&s;t many Competitors is the fewe&s;t degrees remov'd from their common Pro|genitor who fir&s;t obtain'd the Crown: Others look only upon the la&s;t that po&s;&s;e&s;t it. Some admit of Repre&s;entation, by which means the Grand|child of a King by his elde&s;t Son, is prefer'd before his &s;econd Son, he being &s;aid to repre&s;ent his dead Father, who was the elde&s;t: Others ex|clude the&s;e, and advance the younger Son, who is nearer by one degree to the common Progenitor that la&s;t enjoy'd the Crown than the Grand|child. According to the fir&s;t rule, <HI>Richard</HI> II. was advanc'd to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> as Son of the elde&s;t Son of <HI>Edward</HI> III. before his Uncles, who by one degree were nearer to the la&s;t Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or: And in pur&s;uance of the &s;econd, <HI>Sancho</HI> &s;irnam'd the Brave, &s;econd Son of <HI>Alphon&s;o</HI> the Wi&s;e,
<PB N="40" REF="48">
  King of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> was prefer'd before <HI>Alphon&s;o</HI> Son of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> his elde&s;t Brother, according to the Law of <HI>Thane&s;try,</HI> which was in force in <HI>Spain</HI> ever &s;ince we have had any knowledg of that Country, as appears by the conte&s;t between <HI>Corbis</HI> and <HI>Or&s;ua,</HI> decided by Combat before <HI>Scipio Africanus;</HI> continu'd in full force as long as the Kingdom of the <HI>Goths</HI> la&s;t|ed, and was ever highly valu'd, till the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Country, and introduc'd Laws and Cu&s;toms formerly unknown to the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>The Hi&s;torys of all Nations furni&s;h us with innumerable Examples of both &s;orts; and who&s;oever takes upon him to determin which &s;ide is in the right, ought to &s;hew by what authority he undertakes to be the Judg of Mankind, and how the infinite breaches thereby made upon the rights of the governing Familys &s;hall be cur'd, without the overthrow of tho&s;e that he &s;hall condemn, and of the Nations where &s;uch Laws have bin in force as he di&s;likes: and till that be done, in my opinion, no place will afford a better lodging for him that &s;hall impudently a&s;&s;ume &s;uch a Pow|er, than the new buildings in <HI>Moor-Fields.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis no le&s;s hard to decide whether this next Heir is to be &s;ought in the Male Line only, or whether Females al&s;o may be admitted. If we fol|low the fir&s;t as the Law of God and Nature, the title of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Kings is wholly aboli&s;h'd; for not one of them &s;ince <HI>Henry</HI> the 1<HI>&s;t</HI> has had the lea&s;t pretence to an inheritance by the Ma&s;culine Line; and if it were nece&s;&s;ary, we have enough to &s;ay of tho&s;e that were before him.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid, that the &s;ame Right belongs to Females, it ought to be prov'd that Women are as fit as Men to perform the Office of a King, that is, as the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> &s;aid to <HI>Samuel,</HI> to go in and out before us, to judg us, and to fight our Battels; for it were an impious folly to &s;ay that God had ordain'd tho&s;e for the Offices on which the good of Mankind &s;o much de|pends, who by nature are unable to perform the dutys of them. If on the other &s;ide, the &s;weetne&s;s, gentlene&s;s, delicacy, and tenderne&s;s of the Sex render them &s;o unfit for manly exerci&s;es, that they are accounted ut|terly repugnant to, and incon&s;i&s;tent with that mode&s;ty which dos &s;o emi|nently &s;hine in all tho&s;e that are good among&s;t them; that Law of Na|ture which &s;hould advance them to the Government of Men, would over|throw its own Work, and make tho&s;e to be the Heads of Nations, which cannot be the Heads of privat Familys; for, as the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>The Wo|man is not the head of the Man, but the Man is the head of the Women.</HI> This were no le&s;s than to oblige Mankind to lay a&s;ide the name of rea&s;onable Creature: for if Rea&s;on be his Nature, it cannot enjoin that which is con|trary to it &s;elf; if it be not, the definition <HI>Homo e&s;t animal rationale,</HI> is fal&s;e, and ought no longer to be a&s;&s;um'd.</P>
<P>If any man think the&s;e Arguments to be mi&s;taken or mi&s;appli'd, I de|&s;ire him to enquire of the <HI>French</HI> Nation on what account they have al|ways excluded Females, and &s;uch as de&s;cended from them? How comes the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon</HI> to be advanc'd to the Throne before a great Num|ber of Familys that come from the Daughters of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Valois?</HI> Or what title tho&s;e could have before the Daughters of the other Lines, de&s;cended from <HI>Hugh Capet, Pepin, Meroveus,</HI> or <HI>Pharamond?</HI> I know not how &s;uch que&s;tions would be receiv'd; but I am inclin'd to think that the wickedne&s;s and folly of tho&s;e who &s;hould thereby endeavour to over|throw the mo&s;t antient and mo&s;t venerated Con&s;titutions of the greate&s;t Nations, and by that means to involve them in the mo&s;t inextricable diffi|cultys, would be requited only with Stones.</P>

When God de&s;cribes who &s;hould be the King of his People (if they would have one) and how he &s;hould govern; no mention is made <NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 17.</NOTE>of Daughters. The <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> offer'd the Kingdom to <HI>Gideon,</HI> and to his Sons: God promis'd, and gave it to <HI>Saul, David, Jeroboam, Jehu,</HI> and their Sons. When all of them, &s;ave <HI>David,</HI> by their Crimes fell from the Kingdom, the Males only were extirpated; and the Females who had no part in the Promi&s;es, did not fall under the Penaltys, or the Ven|geance that was executed upon tho&s;e Familys: and we do not in the Word of God, or in the Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Jews,</HI> hear of any Feminin Reign, except that which was u&s;urp'd by <HI>Athaliah;</HI> nor that any con&s;ideration was had of their De&s;cendents in relation to the Kingdom: which is e|nough to &s;hew that it is not according to the Law of God, nor to the Law of Nature, which cannot differ from it. So that Females, or &s;uch as derive their right by inheritance from Females, mu&s;t have it from &s;ome other Law, or they can have none at all.</P>
<P>But tho this que&s;tion were authentically decided, and concluded that Females might or might not &s;ucceed, we &s;hould not be at the end of our conte&s;ts: for if they were excluded, it would not from thence follow, as in <HI>France,</HI> that their De&s;cendents &s;hould be &s;o al&s;o; for the Privilege which is denied to them, becau&s;e they cannot, without receding from the mode&s;ty and gentlene&s;s of the Sex, take upon them to execute all the Dutys requir'd, may be transfer'd to their Children, as <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;econd and <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh were admitted, tho their Mothers were re|jected.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid that every Nation ought in this to follow their own Con|&s;titutions, we are at an end of our Controver&s;ys; for they ought not to be follow'd, unle&s;s they are rightly made: They cannot be rightly made, if they are contrary to the univer&s;al Law of God and Nature. If there be a general Rule, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible but &s;ome of them, being directly contrary to each other, mu&s;t be contrary to it. If therefore all of them are to be follow'd, there can be no general Law given to all; but every People is by God and Nature left to the liberty of regulating the&s;e matters relat|ing to them&s;elves according to their own prudence or convenience: and this &s;eems to be &s;o certainly true, that who&s;oever dos, as our Author, propo&s;e Doctrins to the contrary, mu&s;t either be thought ra&s;hly to utter that which he dos not under&s;tand, or maliciou&s;ly to ca&s;t balls of Divi&s;ion among all Nations, whereby every man's Sword would be drawn again&s;t every man, to the total &s;ubver&s;ion of all Order and Government.</P>

<HEAD>  SECT. XIX. Kings cannot confer the right of Father upon Princes, nor Princes upon Kings.</HEAD>
<P>LEST what has bin &s;aid before by our Author &s;hould not be &s;uffici|ent to accompli&s;h his de&s;ign of bringing confu&s;ion upon Mankind, and &s;ome may yet lie &s;till for want of knowing at who&s;e command he &s;hould cut his Brother's throat, if he has not power or courage to &s;et up a title for him&s;elf, he has a new project that would certainly do his work, if it were receiv'd. Not content with the ab&s;urditys and untruths alrea|dy utter'd in giving the incommunicable right of Fathers, not only to tho&s;e who, as is manife&s;tly te&s;tify'd by &s;acred and profane Hi&s;torys, did u&s;urp a power over their Fathers, or &s;uch as ow'd no manner of obedi|ence to them: and ju&s;tifying tho&s;e U&s;urpations, which are mo&s;t odious to God and all good men, he now fancys a Kingdom &s;o gotten may e&s;|cheat for want of an Heir; whereas there is no need of &s;eeking any, if U&s;urpation can confer a Right, and that he who gets the Power into his hands, ought to be reputed the right Heir of the fir&s;t Progenitor; for &s;uch a one will &s;eldom be wanting, if violence and fraud be ju&s;tified by the command of God, and Nations &s;tand oblig'd to render obedience, till a &s;tronger or more &s;ucce&s;sful Villain throws him from the Throne he had invaded. But if it &s;hould come to pa&s;s that no man would &s;tep into the vacant place, he has a new way of depriving the People of their Right to provide for the Government of them&s;elves. <HI>Becau&s;e,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>the de|pendency of antient Familys is oft ob&s;cure, and worn out of knowledg; there|fore the Wi&s;dom of all or mo&s;t Princes has thought fit many times to adopt tho&s;e for Heads of Familys, and Princes of Provinces, who&s;e merits, abili|tys, or fortunes have ennobled them, and made them fit and capable of &s;uch Royal Favours: All &s;uch prime Heads and Fathers have power to con&s;ent to the uniting and conferring of their fatherly Right and Sovereignty on whom they plea&s;e,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I may ju&s;tly ask how any one or more Familys come to be e&s;teem'd more antient than others, if all are de&s;cended from one common Father, as the Scriptures te&s;tify; or to what purpo&s;e it were to inquire what Fa|milys were the mo&s;t antient, if there were any &s;uch, when the younge&s;t and mo&s;t mean by u&s;urpation gets an ab&s;olute right of Dominion over the elde&s;t, tho his own Progenitors, as <HI>Nimrod</HI> did: but I may certainly conclude, That whatever the Right be that belongs to tho&s;e antient Fa|milys, it is inherent in them, and cannot be confer'd on any other by any human Power; for it proceeds from Nature only. The Duty I owe to my Father dos not ari&s;e from an u&s;urp'd or delegated Power, but from my birth deriv'd from him; and 'tis as impo&s;&s;ible for any man to u&s;urp or receive, by the grant of another, the right of a Father over me, as for him to become, or pretend to be made my Father by another who did not beget me. But if he &s;ay true, this right of Father dos not ari&s;e from Nature; nor the obedience that I owe to him that begot me, from the benefits which I receiv'd, but is merely an artificial thing depending upon the Will of another: and that we may be &s;ure there can be no error in this, our Author attributes it to the wi&s;dom of Princes. But before this
<PB N="43" REF="51">
comes to be authentick, we mu&s;t at the lea&s;t be &s;ure that all Princes have   this great and profound Wi&s;dom, which our Author acknowledges to be in them, and which is certainly nece&s;&s;ary for the doing of &s;uch great things, if they were refer'd to them. They &s;eem to us to be born like other men, and to be generally no wi&s;er than other men. We are not oblig'd to believe that <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> was wi&s;e, till God had given him the heart of a man; or that his Grand&s;on <HI>Bel&s;hazzar,</HI> who being laid in the balance was found too light, had any &s;uch profound Wi&s;dom. <HI>Aha|&s;uerus</HI> &s;hew'd it not in appointing all the People of God to be &s;lain, upon a Lie told to him by a Ra&s;cal; and the matter was not very much mend|ed, when being inform'd of the truth, he gave 'em leave to kill as many of their Enemys as they pleas'd. The hardne&s;s of <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s heart, and the overthrow thereby brought upon him&s;elf and People, dos not argue &s;o profound a Judgment as our Author pre&s;umes every Prince mu&s;t have: And 'tis not probable that <HI>Samuel</HI> would have told <HI>Saul, He had done foo|li&s;hly,</HI> if Kings had always bin &s;o exceeding wi&s;e: Nay, if Wi&s;dom had bin annex'd to the Character, <HI>Solomon</HI> might have &s;par'd the pains of asking it from God, and <HI>Rehoboam</HI> mu&s;t have had it. Not to multiply ex|amples out of Scripture, 'tis believ'd that <HI>Xerxes</HI> had not inflicted Stripes upon the Sea for breaking his Navy in pieces, if he had bin &s;o very wi&s;e. <HI>Caligula</HI> for the &s;ame rea&s;on might have &s;av'd the labour of making love to the Moon, or have cho&s;en a fitter Subject to advance to the Con&s;ulat than his Hor&s;e <HI>Incitatus: Nero</HI> had not endeavour'd to make a Woman of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sueton.</NOTE>a Man, nor married a Man as a Woman. Many other Examples might be alledg'd to &s;hew that Kings are not always wi&s;e: and not only the <HI>Ro|man</HI> Satyri&s;t, who &s;ays <HI>Quicquid delirant Reges,</HI> &amp;c. &s;hews that he did <NOTE PLACE="marg">Horat.</NOTE>not believe them to be generally wi&s;er than other men; but <HI>Solomon</HI> him|&s;elf judges them to be as liable to infirmitys, when he prefers a wi&s;e Child before an old and fooli&s;h King. If therefore the &s;trength of our Author's Argument lies in the certainty of the Wi&s;dom of Kings, it can be of no value, till he proves it to be more univer&s;al in them than Hi&s;tory or Experience will permit us to believe. Nay, if there be Truth or Wi&s;dom in the Scripture, which frequently repre&s;ents the wicked Man as a Fool, we cannot think that all Kings are wi&s;e, unle&s;s it be prov'd that none of them have bin wicked; and when this is perform'd by <HI>Filmer</HI>'s Di&s;ci|ples, I &s;hall confe&s;s my error.</P>
<P>Men give te&s;timony of their Wi&s;dom, when they undertake that which they ought to do, and rightly perform that which they undertake; both which points do utterly fail in the &s;ubject of our Di&s;cour&s;e. We have of|ten heard of &s;uch as have adopted tho&s;e to be their Sons who were not &s;o, and &s;ome Civil Laws approve it. This &s;ignifies no more, than that &s;uch a Man, either thro affection to one who is not his Son, or to his Parents&punc; or for &s;ome other rea&s;on, takes him into his Family, and &s;hews kindne&s;s to him, as to his Son: but the adoption of Fathers is a whim&s;ical piece of non&s;en&s;e. If this be capable of an aggravation, I think none can be greater, than not to leave it to my own di&s;cretion, who having no Fa|ther, may re&s;olve to pay the Duty I ow'd to my Father to one who may have &s;hew'd Kindne&s;s to me; but for another to impo&s;e a Father upon a Man, or a People compos'd of Fathers, or &s;uch as have Fathers, where|by they &s;hould be depriv'd of that natural Honour and Right which he makes the foundation of his Di&s;cour&s;e, is the utmo&s;t of all ab&s;urditys. If any Prince therefore has ever undertaken to appoint Fathers of his Peo|ple, he cannot be accounted a man of profound Wi&s;dom, but a Fool or a
<PB N="44" REF="52">
  Madman; and his Acts can be of no value. But if the thing were con|&s;onant to Nature, and refer'd to the Will of Princes (which I ab&s;o|lutely deny) the frequent Extravagancys committed by them in the ele|vation of their Favorites, &s;hews that they intend not to make them Fa|thers of the People, or know not what they do when they do it.</P>
<P>To chu&s;e or in&s;titute a Father is non&s;en&s;e in the very term; but if any were to be cho&s;en to perform the Office of Fathers to &s;uch as have none, and are not of age to provide for them&s;elves (as men do Tutors or Guar|dians for Orphans) none could be capable of being elected, but &s;uch as in kindne&s;s to the per&s;on they were to take under their care, did mo&s;t re|&s;emble his true Father, and had the virtues and abilitys requir'd rightly to provide for his good. If this fails, all Right cea&s;es; and &s;uch a corruption is introduc'd as we &s;aw in our Court of Wards, which the Nation could not bear, when the In&s;titution was perverted, and the King, who ought to have taken a tender care of the Wards and their E&s;tates, deliver'd 'em as a prey to tho&s;e whom he favour'd.</P>
<P>Our Author ridiculou&s;ly attributes the Title and Authority of Father to the word <HI>Prince;</HI> for it has none in it, and &s;ignifies no more than a Man, who in &s;ome kind is more eminent than the Vulgar. In this &s;en&s;e <NOTE PLACE="marg">Trecenti Ro|manae juventu|tis Principes. <HI>T.

<P>The like are and ought to be the Princes of every Nation; and tho &s;omething of Honour may ju&s;tly be attributed to the De&s;cendents of &s;uch as have done great Services to their Country, yet they who degenerate from them cannot be e&s;teem'd Princes; much le&s;s can &s;uch Honours or Rights be confer'd upon Court-creatures or Favorites. <HI>Tiberius, Cali|gula, Claudius, Nero, Galba,</HI> and others, could advance <HI>Macro, Pallas, Narci&s;&s;us, Tigellinus, Vinnius, Laco,</HI> and the like, to the highe&s;t de|grees of Riches and Power; but they &s;till continu'd to be Villains, and &s;o they died.</P>
<P>No wi&s;e or good Man ever thought otherwi&s;e of tho&s;e, who thro the folly of Princes have bin advanc'd to the highe&s;t places in &s;everal Coun|trys. The madne&s;s of attributing to them a paternal power, &s;eems to have bin peculiarly re&s;erv'd to compleat the in&s;amy of our Author; for he only could acknowledg a cooptitious Father, or give to another man the power of chu&s;ing him. I confe&s;s that a man in his infancy may have bin expos'd, like <HI>Mo&s;es, Cyrus, Oedipus, Romulus:</HI> He may have bin taken in War; or by the charity of &s;ome good per&s;on &s;av'd from the teeth of wild Bea&s;ts, or from the Sword by which his Parents fell, and may have bin educated with that care which Fathers u&s;ually have of their Children: 'tis rea&s;onable that &s;uch a one in the whole cour&s;e of his life &s;hould pay that veneration and obedience to him, who gave him as it were a &s;econd birth, which was due to his natural Father; and this, tho improperly,
<PB N="45" REF="53">
may be call'd an Adoption. But to think that any man can a&s;&s;ume it to   him&s;elf, or confer it upon another, and thereby arrogate to him&s;elf the &s;ervice and obedience, which, by the mo&s;t tender and &s;acred Laws of Nature, we owe to tho&s;e from whom we receive Birth and Education, is the mo&s;t prepo&s;terous folly that hitherto has ever enter'd into the heart of man.</P>
<P>Our Author neverthele&s;s is not a&s;ham'd of it, and gives Rea&s;ons no way un&s;utable to the Propo&s;ition. <HI>Men are,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>adopted Fathers of Provinces for their Abilitys, Merits, or Fortunes.</HI> But the&s;e Abilitys can &s;imply de&s;erve nothing; for it they are ill employ'd, they are the wor&s;t of Vices, and the mo&s;t powerful In&s;truments of Mi&s;chief. Merits, in regard of another, are nothing unle&s;s they be to him; and he alone can merit from me the re&s;pect due to a Father, who has confer'd Benefits upon me, in &s;ome mea&s;ure proportionable to tho&s;e which we u&s;ually re|ceive from our Fathers: and the world may judg, whether all the Court-Mini&s;ters and Favorites that we have known, do upon this account de|&s;erve to be e&s;teem'd Fathers of Nations. But to allow this on account of their Fortunes, is, if po&s;&s;ible, more extravagant than any thing that has bin yet utter'd. By this account <HI>Mazarin</HI> mu&s;t have bin Father of the <HI>French</HI> Nation: The &s;ame Right was inherited by his cha&s;t Niece, and remain'd in her, till &s;he and her &s;illy Husband di&s;&s;ipated the Trea&s;ures which her Uncle had torn from the Bowels of that People. The Parti|zans may generally claim the &s;ame Right over the Provinces they have pillag'd: <HI>Old Audley, Dog Smith,</HI> Bp <HI>Duppa, Brownloe, Child, Da&s;hwood, Fox,</HI> &amp;c. are to be e&s;teem'd Fathers of the People of <HI>England.</HI> This Doctrin is perfectly Canonical, if <HI>Filmer</HI> and <HI>Heylin</HI> were good Divines; and Legal, if they judg'd more rightly touching matters of Law. But if it be ab&s;urd and dete&s;table, they are to be reputed Men, who, by attri|buting the highe&s;t Honours to the vile&s;t Wretches of the world, for what they had gain'd by the mo&s;t abominable means, endeavour to encrea&s;e tho&s;e Vices, which are already come to &s;uch a height, that they can by no other way be brought to a greater. Daily experience too plainly &s;hews, with what rage Avarice u&s;ually fills the hearts of men. There are not many de&s;tructive Villanys committed in the World, that do not proceed from it. In this re&s;pect 'tis call'd <HI>Idolatry,</HI> and <HI>the root of all evil. Solomon</HI> warns us to beware of &s;uch as make ha&s;t to grow rich, and &s;ays, they &s;hall not be innocent. But 'tis no matter what the Pro|phets, the Apo&s;tles, or the wi&s;e&s;t of men &s;ay of Riches, and the ways of gaining them; for our Author tells us, that men of the greate&s;t Fortunes, without examining how they came to them, or what u&s;e they make of them, de&s;erve to be made Fathers of Provinces.</P>
<P>But this is not his only quarrel with all that is ju&s;t and good: His whole Book goes directly again&s;t the letter and &s;pirit of the Scripture. The work of all tho&s;e, whom God in &s;everal Ages has rais'd up to announce his Word, was to abate the Lu&s;ts and Pa&s;&s;ions that ari&s;e in the hearts of men; to &s;hew the vanity of worldly Enjoyments, with the dangers that accom|pany Riches and Honors, and to rai&s;e our hearts to the love of tho&s;e Trea|&s;ures that peri&s;h not. Hone&s;t and wi&s;e men, following the Light of Na|ture, have in &s;ome mea&s;ure imitated this. Such as liv'd private lives, as <HI>Plato, Socrates, Epictetus,</HI> and others, made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to abate mens Lu&s;ts, by &s;hewing the folly of &s;eeking vain Honors, u&s;ele&s;s Riches, or un&s;atis&s;ying Plea&s;ures; and tho&s;e who were like to them, if they were rais'd to &s;upreme Magi&s;tracys, have endeavour'd by the &s;evere&s;t Puni&s;h|ments

  to re&s;train men from commiting the Crimes by which Riches are mo&s;t commonly gain'd: but <HI>Filmer</HI> and <HI>Heylin</HI> lead us into a new way. If they de&s;erve credit, who&s;oever would become &s;upreme Lord and Father of his Country, ab&s;olute, &s;acred and inviolable, is only to kill him that is in the head of the Government: U&s;urpation confers an equal Right with Election or Inheritance: We are to look upon the Pow|er, not the Ways by which it is obtain'd: Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion only is to be re|garded; and men mu&s;t venerate the pre&s;ent Power, as &s;et up by God, tho gain'd by Violence, Treachery or Poi&s;on: Children mu&s;t not impo&s;e Laws upon, nor examin the Actions of their Father. Tho&s;e who are a little more mode&s;t, and would content them&s;elves with the Honour of being Fathers and Lords only of Provinces, if they get Riches by the &s;a|vour of the King, or the favour of the King by Riches, may receive that honour from him: The Lord Paramount may make them peculiar Lords of each Province as &s;acred as him&s;elf; and by that means every man &s;hall have an immediat and a &s;ubaltern Father. This would be a Spur to excite even the mo&s;t &s;leeping Lu&s;ts; and a Poi&s;on that would fill the gentle&s;t Spirits with the mo&s;t violent Furys. If men &s;hould believe this, there would hardly be found one of whom it might not be &s;aid, <HI>Hac &s;pe, minanti fulmen occurret Jovi.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Senec.

And I doubt, whether the wickedne&s;s of filling mens heads with &s;uch Notions was ever equal'd, unle&s;s by him who &s;aid, <HI>Ye &s;hall not die, but be as Gods.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;ince our Author is pleas'd to teach us the&s;e &s;trange things, I wi&s;h he would al&s;o have told us, how many men in every Nation ought to be look'd upon as adopted Fathers: What proportion of Riches, Ability or Merit, is naturally or divinely requir'd to make them capable of this &s;ublime Character: Whether the Right of this Chimerical Father dos not de&s;troy that of the Natural; or whether both continue in force, and men thereby &s;tand oblig'd, in de&s;pite of what Chri&s;t &s;aid, to &s;erve two Ma&s;ters. For if the Right of my Artificial Father ari&s;e from any Act of the King, in favour of his Riches, Abilitys or Merit, I ought to know whether he is to excel in all, or any one of the&s;e Points; How far, and which of 'em gives the preference; &s;ince 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for me to deter|min whether my Father, who may be wi&s;e, tho not rich, is thereby deve&s;ted of his Right, and it comes to be transfer'd to another, who may be rich tho not wi&s;e, nor of any per&s;onal merit at all, till that Point be decided; or, &s;o much as to gue&s;s when I am emancipated from the Duty I owe to him, by whom I was begotten and educated, unle&s;s I know whether he be fallen from his Right, thro want of Merit, Wi&s;dom or E&s;tate; and that can never be, till it be determin'd, that he has forfeited his Right, by being defective in all, or any of the three; and what pro|portion of Merit, Wi&s;dom or E&s;tate is requir'd in him, &s;or the enjoy|ment of his Right, or in another that would acquire it: for no man can &s;ucceed to the Right of another, unle&s;s the fir&s;t Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or be rightly de|priv'd of it; and it cannot belong to them both, becau&s;e common &s;en&s;e univer&s;ally teaches, that two di&s;tinct Per&s;ons cannot, at the &s;ame time, and in the &s;ame degree, have an equal Right to the &s;ame individual thing.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="55">
The Right of Father cannot therefore be confer'd upon Princes by   Kings, but mu&s;t for ever follow the Rule of Nature. The Character of a Father is indelible, and incommunicable: The Duty of Children ari&s;ing from Benefits receiv'd is perpetual, becau&s;e they can never not have receiv'd them, and can be due only to him from whom they are receiv'd. For the&s;e Rea&s;ons we &s;ee, that &s;uch as our Author calls Prin|ces, cannot confer it upon a King; for they cannot give what they have not in them&s;elves: They who have nothing, can give nothing: They who are only &s;uppo&s;ititious, cannot make another to be real; and the Whim&s;y of Kings making Princes to be Fathers, and Princes conferring that Right on Kings, comes to nothing.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XX. All ju&s;t Magi&s;tratical Power is from the People.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING prov'd that the Right of a Father proceeds from the Generation and Education of his Children: That no man can have that Right over tho&s;e, whom he has not begotten and educated: That every man has it over tho&s;e who owe their Birth and Education to him: That all the Sons of <HI>Noah, Abraham, I&s;aac, Jacob,</HI> and others, did equally inherit it: That by the &s;ame Rea&s;ons, it dos for ever belong to every man that begets Children; it plainly appears, that no Father can have a Right over others, unle&s;s it be by them granted to him, and that he receive his Right from tho&s;e who granted it. But our Au|thor, with an admirable &s;agacity peculiar to him&s;elf, di&s;covers, and with equal confidence tells us, that that which is from the People, or the chief Heads of them, is not from the People: <HI>He that is &s;o elected,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>claims not his Right from the People as a Donative, but from God.</HI> That is, if I mi&s;take not, <HI>Romulus</HI> was not made King of the <HI>Romans</HI> by that People, but by God: Tho&s;e men being newly gather'd together, had two Fathers, tho neither of them had any Children; and no man knew who was their Father, nor which of 'em was the elder: But <HI>Romulus</HI> by the &s;laughter of his Brother decided all Que&s;tions, and purchas'd to him&s;elf a Royal Charter from God; and the Act of the People which confer'd the Power on him, was the Act of God. We had formerly learnt, that what&s;oever was done by Monarchs, was to be imputed to God; and that who&s;oever murder'd the Father of a People, acquir'd the &s;ame Right to him&s;elf: but now it &s;eems, that Nations al&s;o have the &s;ame privilege, and that God dos what they do. Now I under&s;tand why it was &s;aid of old, <HI>Vox Populi e&s;t Vox Dei:</HI> But if it was &s;o in regard of <HI>Romulus,</HI> the &s;ame mu&s;t be confe&s;t of <HI>Tullus Ho&s;tilius, Ancus Martius, Tarquinius Pri&s;cus,</HI> and <HI>Servius Tullus;</HI> who being all &s;trangers to each other, and mo&s;t of them Aliens al&s;o, were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively advanc'd by the &s;ame People, without any re&s;pect to the Children, Relations or Heirs of their Predece&s;&s;ors. And I cannot comprehend, why the Act of the &s;ame People &s;hould not have the &s;ame Virtue, and be equally attributed to God, when they gave the &s;ame or more power to Con&s;uls, Military Tribunes, <HI>Decemviri,</HI> or Dictators; or why the &s;ame Divine Character &s;hould not be in the &s;ame manner confer'd upon any Magi&s;tracys, that by any Peo|ple have bin, are, or &s;hall be at any time erected for the &s;ame ends.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="56">
  Upon the &s;ame grounds we may conclude, that no Privilege is pecu|liarly annex'd to any Form of Government; but that all Magi&s;trats are equally the Mini&s;ters of God, who perform the Work for which they were in&s;tituted; and that the People which in&s;titutes them, may propor|tion, regulate and terminate their Power, as to time, mea&s;ure, and num|ber of Per&s;ons, as &s;eems mo&s;t convenient to them&s;elves, which can be no other than their own good. For it cannot be imagin'd that a multitude of People &s;hould &s;end for <HI>Numa,</HI> or any other Per&s;on to whom they ow'd nothing, to reign over 'em, that he might live in Glory and Plea&s;ure; or for any other rea&s;on, than that it might be good for them and their Po&s;terity. This &s;hews the Work of all Magi&s;trats to be always and every where the &s;ame, even the doing of Ju&s;tice, and procuring the Wel|fare of tho&s;e that create them. This we learn from common &s;en&s;e: <HI>Plato, Ari&s;totle, Cicero,</HI> and the be&s;t human Authors lay it as an un|movable Foundation, upon which they build their Arguments relating to matters of that nature: And the Apo&s;tle from better Authority declares, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 13.</NOTE><HI>That Rulers are not a terror to good Works, but to Evil: Wilt thou then not be afraid of the Power? do that which is good, and thou &s;halt have prai&s;e of the &s;ame; for he is the Mini&s;ter of God unto thee for good: But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he bears not the Sword in vain; for he is the Mini&s;ter of God, a revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doth evil.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Tim. 2.</NOTE>And the rea&s;on he gives <HI>for praying for Kings, and all that are in Autho|rity,</HI> is, <HI>that we may live a quiet and peaceable life, in all godline&s;s and hone|&s;ty.</HI> But if this be the Work of the Magi&s;trate, and the glorious Name of God's Mini&s;ter be given to him for the performance of it, we may ea|&s;ily &s;ee to whom that Title belongs. <HI>His Children and Servants ye are; who&s;e Works ye do.</HI> He therefore, and he only, is the Servant of God, who dos the Work of God; who is a terror to tho&s;e that do evil, and a prai&s;e to tho&s;e that do well; who bears the Sword for the puni&s;hment of Wickedne&s;s and Vice, and &s;o governs, that the People may live quietly in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty. The order of his In&s;titution is inverted, and the In&s;titution vacated, if the Power be turn'd to the prai&s;e of tho&s;e that do evil, and becomes a terror to &s;uch as do well; and that none who live hone&s;tly and ju&s;tly can be quiet under it. If God be the Fountain of Ju&s;tice, Mercy and Truth, and tho&s;e his Servants who walk in them, no exerci&s;e of Violence, Fraud, Cruelty, Pride, or Avarice, is patroniz'd by him: and they who are the Authors of tho&s;e Villanys, cannot but be the Mini&s;ters of him, who &s;ets him&s;elf up again&s;t God; becau&s;e 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible that Truth and Fal&s;hood, Mercy and Cruelty, Ju&s;tice and the mo&s;t violent Oppre&s;&s;ion can proceed from the &s;ame Root. It was a folly and a lie in tho&s;e <HI>Jews,</HI> to call them&s;elves the Children of <HI>Abraham,</HI> who did not the Works of <HI>Abraham;</HI> and Chri&s;t declar'd them to be the Chil|dren <NOTE PLACE="marg">John 8. 39.</NOTE>of the Devil, who&s;e Works they did; which words proceeding from the Eternal Truth, do as well indicate to us who&s;e Child and Ser|vant every man is to be accounted, as to tho&s;e who fir&s;t heard them.</P>
<P>If our Author's former A&s;&s;ertions were void of Judgment and Truth, his next Clau&s;e &s;hews a great defect in his Memory, and contradicts the former: <HI>The Judgments of God,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>who has Power to give and take away Kingdoms, are mo&s;t ju&s;t; yet the mini&s;try of Men, who execute God's Judgments without Commi&s;&s;ion, is &s;inful and damnable.</HI> If it be true, as he &s;ays, that we are to look at the Power, not the Ways by which it is gain'd; and that he who has it, whether it be by U&s;urpation, Conque&s;t, or any other means, is to be accounted as Father, or right Heir to the

Father of the People, to which Title the mo&s;t &s;ublime and divine Pri|vileges   are annex'd; a man who by the mo&s;t wicked and unju&s;t Actions advances him&s;elf to the Power, becomes immediatly the Father of the Peo|ple, and the Mini&s;ter of God; which I take to be a piece of Divinity worthy our Author and his Di&s;ciples.</P>
<P>It may be doubted what he means by a Commi&s;&s;ion from God; for we know of none but what is outwardly by his Word, or inwardly by his Spirit; and I am apt to think, that neither he nor his Abettors allowing of either as to the Point in que&s;tion, he dos foully prevaricate, in alledg|ing that which he thinks cannot be of any effect. If any man &s;hould &s;ay, that the Word of God to <HI>Mo&s;es, Jo&s;hua, Ehud, Gideon, Samuel, Jerobo|am</HI> and <HI>Jehu,</HI> or any others, are, in the like ca&s;es, Rules to be ob&s;erv'd by all; becau&s;e that which was from God was good, that which was good, is good; and he that dos good, is ju&s;tified by it: He would proba|bly tell us, that what was good in them, is not good in others; and that the Word of God dos ju&s;tify tho&s;e only to whom it is &s;poken: That is to &s;ay, No man can execute the ju&s;t Judgments of God, to the benefit of mankind, according to the Example of tho&s;e Servants of God, without damnable &s;in, unle&s;s he have a preci&s;e Word particularly directed to him for it, as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> had. But if any man &s;hould pretend that &s;uch a Word was come to him, he would be accounted an Enthu&s;ia&s;t, and obtain no credit. So that, which way &s;oever the Clau&s;e be taken, it appears to be full of Fraud, confe&s;&s;ing only in the Theory, that which he thinks can never be brought into practice; that his beloved Villanys may be thereby &s;ecur'd, and that the glorious Examples of the mo&s;t heroick Actions, per|form'd by the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t men that ever were in the World for the benefit of mankind, may never be imitated.</P>
<P>The next Clau&s;e &s;hews, that I did our Author no wrong in &s;aying, that he gave a right to U&s;urpation; for he plainly &s;ays, <HI>That whether the Prince be the &s;upreme Father of his People, or the true Heir of &s;uch a Father; or whether he come to the Crown by &V;&s;urpation, or Election of the Nobles or People, or by any other way what&s;oever, &amp;c. it is the only Right and Authority of the natural Father.</HI> In the 3<HI>d Chap.</HI> Sect. 8. <HI>It skills not which way the King comes by his Power, whether by Election, Donation, Succe&s;&s;ion, or by any other means.</HI> And in another place, <HI>That we are to regard the Power, not the Means by which it is gain'd.</HI> To which I need &s;ay no more, than that I cannot &s;ufficiently admire the ingeniou&s;ly invented Title of Father by U&s;urpation; and confe&s;s, that &s;ince there is &s;uch a thing in the World, to which not only privat men, but whole Nations owe obedience, what&s;o|ever has bin &s;aid antiently, (as was thought to expre&s;s the highe&s;t exce&s;s of Fury and Inju&s;tice) as, <HI>Jus datum &s;celeri; Jus omne in ferro e&s;t &s;itum;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lucan. &amp;c.</NOTE><HI>Jus licet in jugulos no&s;tros &s;ibi fecerit en&s;e; Sylla potens Mariu&s;&abque; ferox &amp; Cinna cruentus, Cae&s;areaeque domus &s;eries;</HI> were &s;olid Truths, good Law and Divinity; which did not only &s;ignify the actual exerci&s;e of the Pow|er, but induc'd a con&s;cientious Obligation of obeying it.

The like may be &s;aid of <HI>Agathocles, Diony&s;ius, Phalaris, Bu&s;iris, Machanidas, Peter</HI> the Cruel of <HI>Ca&s;tile, Chri&s;tiern</HI> of <HI>Denmark,</HI> the la&s;t Princes of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Valois</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Philip</HI> the Second of <HI>Spain.</HI> Tho&s;e Actions of theirs which men have ever e&s;teem'd mo&s;t dete&s;table, and the whole cour&s;e of their abominable Government, did not proceed from Pride, Avarice, Cruelty, Madne&s;s and Lu&s;t, but from the tender care of mo&s;t pious Fathers. <HI>Tacitus</HI> &s;adly de&s;cribes the &s;tate of his Country: <HI>&V;rbs incendiis va&s;tata, con&s;umptis antiqui&s;&s;imis delubris, ip&s;o Capitolio Civium manibus incen&s;o; pollutae Ceremoniae; magna Adulteria; plenum Exiliis mare; infecti caedibus &s;copuli; atrocius in &V;rbe &s;aevitum; Nobilitas, opes, omi&s;&s;i vel ge&s;ti honores pro crimine, &amp; ob virtutes certi&s;&s;i|mum exitium:</HI> But he was to blame; all this proceeded from the ardency of a paternal Affection. When <HI>Nero,</HI> by the death of <HI>Helvidius Pri&s;cus</HI> and <HI>Thra&s;eas,</HI> endeavour'd to cut up Vertue by the roots, <HI>ip&s;am ex&s;cindere virtutem,</HI> he did it, becau&s;e he knew it was good for the World that there &s;hould be no vertuous man in it. When he fir'd the City, and when <HI>Caligula</HI> wi&s;h'd the People had but one Neck that he might &s;trike it off at one blow, they did it thro a prudent care of their Childrens good, knowing it would be for their advantage to be de&s;troy'd; and that the empty de&s;olated World would be no more troubled with popular Sediti|ons. By the &s;ame rule <HI>Pharaoh, Eglon, Nebuchodono&s;or, Antiochus, He|rod,</HI> and the like, were Fathers of the <HI>Hebrews.</HI> And without looking far backward, or depending upon the Faith of Hi&s;tory, we may enume|rate many Princes, who in a perpetual care of their People, have not yielded to <HI>Nero</HI> or <HI>Caligula.</HI> If our Author &s;ay true, all tho&s;e Actions of theirs, which we have ever attributed to the utmo&s;t exce&s;s of Pride, Cru|elty, Avarice and Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s, proceeded from their princely Wi&s;dom and fatherly Kindne&s;s to the Nations under 'em: and we are beholden to him for the di&s;covery of &s;o great a My&s;tery, which has bin hid from man|kind from the beginning of the World to this day: if not, we may &s;till look upon them as Children of the Devil; and continue to believe, that Princes as well as other Magi&s;trats were &s;et up by the People for the pub|lick Good; that the Prai&s;es given to &s;uch as are Wi&s;e, Ju&s;t and Good, are purely per&s;onal, and can belong only to tho&s;e, who by a due exerci&s;e of their Power do de&s;erve it, and to no others.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. I. That 'tis natural for Nations to govern, or to chu&s;e Governors; and that Vertue only gives a natural preference of one man above another, or rea&s;on why one &s;hould be cho&s;en rather than another.</HEAD>
<P>IN this Chapter our Author fights valiantly again&s;t <HI>Bellarmin</HI> and <HI>Sua|rez,</HI> &s;eeming to think him&s;elf victorious, if he can &s;hew that either of them has contradicted the other, or him&s;elf; but being no way concern'd in them, I &s;hall leave their followers to defend their Quar|rel: My work is to &s;eek after Truth; and, tho they may have &s;aid &s;ome things, in matters not concerning their beloved Cau&s;e of Popery, that are agreeable to Rea&s;on, Law, or Scripture, I have little hope of finding it among tho&s;e who apply them&s;elves chiefly to School Sophi&s;try, as the be&s;t means to &s;upport Idolatry. That which I maintain, is the Cau&s;e of Mankind; which ought not to &s;uffer, tho Champions of corrupt Princi|ples have weakly defended, or maliciou&s;ly betray'd it: and therefore not at all relying on their Authority, I intend to reject what&s;oever they &s;ay that agrees not with Rea&s;on, Scripture, or the approv'd Examples of the be&s;t poli&s;h'd Nations. He al&s;o attacks <HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> upon who&s;e Opinions I &s;et a far greater value, in as much as they &s;eem to have pene|trated more deeply into the &s;ecrets of human Nature; and not only to have judg'd more rightly of the Intere&s;ts of Mankind, but al&s;o to have comprehended in their Writings the Wi&s;dom of the <HI>Grecians,</HI> with all that they had learn'd from the <HI>Phaenicians, Egyptians,</HI> and <HI>Hebrews;</HI> which may lead us to the di&s;covery of the Truth we &s;eek. If this be our work, the que&s;tion is not, whether it be a <HI>Paradox,</HI> or <HI>a receiv'd Opinion, That People naturally govern, or chu&s;e Governors;</HI> but whether it be true or not: for many Paradoxes are true, and the mo&s;t gro&s;s Errors have often bin mo&s;t common. Tho I hope to prove, that what he calls a Paradox, is not only true; but a Truth planted in the hearts of men, and acknowledg'd &s;o to be by all that have hearkned to the voice of Nature, and di&s;approv'd by none, but &s;uch as thro wickedne&s;s, &s;tupidity, or ba&s;ene&s;s of Spirit, &s;eem to have degenerated into the wor&s;t of bea&s;ts, and to have retain'd nothing of men, but the outward &s;hape, or the ability of doing tho&s;e mi&s;|chiefs which they have learn'd from their Ma&s;ter the Devil.</P>
<P>We have already &s;een, that the Patriarchical Power re&s;embles not the Regal in principle or practice: that the beginning and continuance of Regal Power was contrary to, and incon&s;i&s;tent with the Patriarchical: that the fir&s;t Fathers of mankind left all their Children independent on each other, and in an equal liberty of providing for them&s;elves: that every man con|tinu'd in this liberty, till the number &s;o increas'd, that they became trou|ble&s;om

  and dangerous to each other; and finding no other remedy to the di&s;orders growing, or like to grow among them, join'd many Familys into one civil Body, that they might the better provide for the convenien|cy, &s;afety, and defence of them&s;elves and their Children. This was a collation of every man's privat Right into a publick Stock; and no one having any other right than what was common to all, except it were that of Fathers over their Children, they were all equally free when their Fa|thers were dead; and nothing could induce 'em to join, and le&s;&s;en that natural liberty by joining in Societys, but the hopes of a publick Advan|tage. Such as were wi&s;e and valiant procur'd it, by &s;etting up regular Governments, and placing the be&s;t Men in the Admini&s;tration; whil&s;t the weake&s;t and ba&s;e&s;t fell under the power of the mo&s;t boi&s;terous and violent of their Neighbours. Tho&s;e of the fir&s;t &s;ort had their root in Wi&s;dom and Ju&s;tice, and are call'd lawful Kingdoms or Commonwealths; and the Rules by which they are govern'd, are known by the name of Laws. The&s;e Governments have ever bin the Nur&s;es of Vertue: The Nations living under them have flouri&s;h'd in Peace and Happine&s;s, or made Wars with Glory and Advantage: whereas the other &s;ort &s;pring|ing from Violence and Wrong, have ever gone under the odious title of Tyrannys; and by fomenting Vices, like to tho&s;e from whence they grew, have brought &s;hame and mi&s;ery upon tho&s;e who were &s;ubject to them. This appears &s;o plainly in Scripture, that the a&s;&s;ertors of Liberty want no other Patron than God him&s;elf; and his Word &s;o fully ju&s;tifies what we contend for, that it were not nece&s;&s;ary to make u&s;e of human Au|thority, if our Adver&s;arys did not oblige us to examin &s;uch as are cited by them. This, in our pre&s;ent ca&s;e, would be an ea&s;y work, if our Au|thor had rightly mark'd the pa&s;&s;ages he would make u&s;e of, or had bin faithful in his Interpretation or Explication of &s;uch as he truly cites; but failing gro&s;ly in both, 'tis hard to trace him.</P>
<P>He cites the 16<HI>th</HI> Chapter of the third Book of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s Politicks, and I do not find there is more than twelve; or tho that Wound might be cur'd, by &s;aying the Words are in the twelfth, his Fraud in pervert|ing the Sen&s;e were unpardonable, tho the other mi&s;take be pa&s;t over. 'Tis true that <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> dos there &s;eem to doubt whether there be any &s;uch thing as one man naturally a Lord over many Citizens, &s;ince a City con|&s;i&s;ts of Equals: but in the whole &s;cope of that Chapter, Book, and his other Writings, he fully &s;hews his doubt did not ari&s;e from an imaginati|on that one man could naturally inherit a Right of Dominion over many not de&s;cended from him; or that they were born under a nece&s;&s;ity of be|ing Slaves to him (for &s;uch fancys can proceed only from di&s;temper'd Brains) but that Civil Societys aiming at the publick good, tho&s;e who by nature were endow'd with &s;uch Vertues or Talents as were mo&s;t benefi|cial to them, ought to be prefer'd. And nothing can be more contrary to the frantick whim&s;y of our Author, who fancys an hereditary Preroga|tive of Dominion inherent to a per&s;on as Father of a People, or Heir, or to be reputed Heir of the fir&s;t Father, when 'tis certain he is not, but that either he or his Predece&s;&s;or came in by Election or U&s;urpation, than to &s;hew that 'tis only Wi&s;dom, Ju&s;tice, Valour, and other commendable Vertues, which are not hereditary, that can give the pre&s;erence; and that the only rea&s;on why it &s;hould be given, is, that Men &s;o qualify'd can better than others accompli&s;h the end for which Societys are con&s;tituted: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t.

<PB N="53" REF="61">
which is ju&s;t among Equals, is ju&s;t only among Equals; but &s;uch as are   ba&s;e, ignorant, vicious, &s;lothful, or cowardly, are not equal in natural or acquir'd Vertues, to the generous, wi&s;e, valiant, and indu&s;trious; nor equally u&s;eful to the Societys in which they live: they cannot there|fore have an equal part in the Government of 'em, they cannot equally provide for the common good; and 'tis not a per&s;onal, but a publick Be|nefit that is &s;ought in their con&s;titution and continuance. There may be a hundred thou&s;and men in an Army, who are all equally free; but they only are naturally mo&s;t fit to be Commanders or Leaders, who mo&s;t ex|cel in the Vertues requir'd for the right performance of tho&s;e Offices; and that, not becau&s;e 'tis good for them to be rais'd above their Brethren, but becau&s;e 'tis good for their Brethren to be guided by them, as 'tis ever good to be govern'd by the wi&s;e&s;t and the be&s;t. If the nature of man be Rea&s;on, <HI>Detur digniori,</HI> in matters of this kind, is the voice of Nature; and it were not only a deviation from Rea&s;on, but a mo&s;t de&s;perate and mi&s;chievous madne&s;s, for a Company going to the <HI>Indies,</HI> to give the gui|dance of their Ship to the Son of the be&s;t Pilot in the world, if he want the skill requir'd to that employment, or to one who was maliciou&s;ly &s;et to de&s;troy them: and he only can have a Right grounded upon the dictates of Nature, to be advanc'd to the Helm, who be&s;t knows how to govern it, and has given the be&s;t te&s;timonys of his Integrity and Intentions to imploy his skill for the good of tho&s;e that are imbark'd. But as the work of a Magi&s;trat, e&s;pecially if he be the &s;upreme, is the highe&s;t, noble&s;t, and mo&s;t difficult that can be committed to the charge of a man, a more excellent Vertue is requir'd in the Per&s;on to be advanc'd to it, than for any other; and he that is mo&s;t excellent in that Vertue, is rea&s;onably and naturally to be prefer'd before any other. <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> having this in his view, &s;eems to think, that tho&s;e who believ'd it not to be natural for one man to be Lord of all the Citizens, &s;ince a City con&s;i&s;ts of Equals, had not ob&s;erv'd that inequality of Endowments, Vertues and Abilitys in men, which render &s;ome more fit than others for the performance of their Du|tys, and the Work intended; but it will not be found, as I &s;uppo&s;e, that he did ever dream of a natural Superiority, that any man could ever have in a civil Society, unle&s;s it be &s;uch a &s;uperiority in Vertue as mo&s;t conduces to the publick good.</P>
<P>He confirms this in proceeding to examin the different &s;orts of Govern|ments, according to the different di&s;po&s;itions of Nations; and is &s;o bold to &s;ay, That a <HI>popular Government is the be&s;t for a People, who are natural|ly generous and warlike: that the Government of a few &s;utes be&s;t with tho&s;e, among whom a few men are found to excel others in tho&s;e Vertues that are profitable to Societys; and that the Government of one is good, when that one dos &s;o far &s;urpa&s;s all others in tho&s;e Vertues, that he has more of them than all the re&s;t of the people together.</HI> And for the &s;ame rea&s;on that induc'd him to believe that equality is ju&s;t among&s;t Equals, he concludes inequali|ty of Power to be mo&s;t unju&s;t, unle&s;s there be inequality of Merit; and equality of Power to be &s;o al&s;o, when there is inequality of Vertue, that being the only rule by which every man's part ought to be regulated.</P>
<P>But if it be neither rea&s;onable nor ju&s;t that tho&s;e who are not equal in Vertue &s;hould be made equal in Power, or that &s;uch as are equal in Ver|tue &s;hould be unequal in Power; the mo&s;t brutal and abominable of all extravagancys is to make one or a few, who in Vertue and Abilitys to perform Civil Functions are inferior to others, &s;uperior to all in power: and the Mi&s;erys &s;uffer'd by tho&s;e Nations, who, inverting the Laws of Na|ture

  and Rea&s;on, have plac'd Children or Men of no Vertue in the Go|vernment, when men that excel'd in all Vertues were not wanting, do &s;o far manife&s;t this Truth, that the pains of proving it may be &s;par'd.</P>
<P>'Tis not nece&s;&s;ary for me to inquire, whether it be po&s;&s;ible to find &s;uch a Man as <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> calls <HI>Natur&acirc; Regem;</HI> or whether he intended to recom|mend <HI>Alexander</HI> to the world for the Man de&s;ign'd by God and Nature to be King over all, becau&s;e no man was equal to him in the Vertues that were beneficial to all. For pur&s;uing my Po&s;ition, that Vertue only can give a ju&s;t and natural preference, I ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;s, that when &s;uch a Man, or race of Men as he de&s;cribes, &s;hall appear in the world, they carry the true marks of Sovereignty upon them: We ought to believe, that God has rais'd 'em above all, whom he has made to excel all: It were an impious folly to think of reducing him to the ordinary level of Man|kind, whom God has placed above it. 'Twere better for us to be guid|ed by him, than to follow our own judgment; nay, I could almo&s;t &s;ay, 'twere better to &s;erve &s;uch a Ma&s;ter, than to be free. But this will be nothing to the purpo&s;e, till &s;uch a Man, or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of men do appear; and if our Author would per&s;uade us, that all Mankind, or every parti|cular, is oblig'd to a perpetual &s;ubjection to one Man or Family, upon any other condition, he mu&s;t do it by the credit of tho&s;e who favour his De|&s;ign more than <HI>Ari&s;totle.</HI></P>
<P>I know not who that will be, but am confident he will find no help from <HI>Plato:</HI> for if his Principles be examin'd, by which a grave Author's &s;en&s;e is be&s;t comprehended, it will appear, that all his Books of Laws, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato de Leg. c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> de Republ.</NOTE>and of a Commonwealth, are chiefly grounded upon this, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That Magi|&s;trats are cho&s;en by Societys, &s;eeking their own good; and that the be&s;t men ought to be cho&s;en for the attaining of it:"</Q> whereas his whole de&s;ign of &s;eeking which is the be&s;t form of Government, or what Laws do mo&s;t conduce to its perfection and permanency, (if one Rule were by nature appointed for all, and none could ju&s;tly tran&s;gre&s;s it; if God had de&s;ign'd an univer&s;al Lord over the whole World, or a particular one over every Nation, who could be bound by no Law) were utterly ab|&s;urd; and they who write Books concerning Political matters, and take upon 'em to in&s;truct Nations how to govern them&s;elves, would be found either fooli&s;hly to mi&s;pend their time, or impiou&s;ly to incite People to re|bel again&s;t the Ordinance of God. If this can ju&s;tly be imputed to <HI>Plato;</HI> he is not the wi&s;e Man he is &s;uppos'd to have bin; and can le&s;s de&s;erve the title of Divine, which our Author gives him: but if he remain ju&s;t|ly free from &s;uch Cen&s;ures, it mu&s;t be confe&s;t, that whil&s;t he &s;eeks what is good for a people, and to convince 'em by rea&s;on that it is &s;o, he takes it for granted, that they have a liberty of chu&s;ing that which appears to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato de Leg.</NOTE>be the be&s;t to them. He fir&s;t &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That this Good con&s;i&s;ts in the ob|taining of Ju&s;tice; but farther explaining him&s;elf, he &s;hews that un|der the name of Ju&s;tice, he comprehends all that tends to their perfecti|on and felicity: in as much as every People, by joining in a civil Socie|ty, and creating Magi&s;trats, doth &s;eek its own good; and 'tis ju&s;t, that he or they who are created, &s;hould, to the utmo&s;t of their power, accompli&s;h the end of their Creation, and lead the People to Ju&s;tice, without which there is neither perfection nor happine&s;s: That the pro|per act of Ju&s;tice is to give to every one his due; to Man that which belongs to Man, and to God that which is God's. But as no man can be ju&s;t, or de&s;ire to be &s;o, unle&s;s he know that Ju&s;tice is good; nor know that it is good, unle&s;s he know that original Ju&s;tice and Good|ne&s;s,

If our Au|thor therefore would make u&s;e of <HI>Plato</HI>'s Doctrin to his end, he ought to have prov'd that there is a Family in every Nation, to the chief of which, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to the next in Blood, God dos ever reveal and infu&s;e &s;uch a knowledg of him&s;elf, as may render him a Light to others; and failing in this, all that he &s;ays is to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The weakne&s;s in which we are born, renders us unable to attain this Good of our &s;elves: we want help in all things, e&s;pecially in the greate&s;t. The fierce Barbarity of a loo&s;e Multitude, bound by no Law, and regu|lated by no Di&s;ciplin, is wholly repugnant to it: Whil&s;t every man fears his Neighbour, and has no other defence than his own &s;trength, he mu&s;t live in that perpetual anxiety which is equally contrary to that happine&s;s, and that &s;edate temper of mind which is requir'd for the &s;earch of it. The fir&s;t &s;tep towards the cure of this pe&s;tilent Evil, is for many to join in one body, that every one may be protected by the united force of all, and the various Talents that men po&s;&s;e&s;s, may by good di&s;ciplin be ren|der'd u&s;eful to the whole; as the meane&s;t piece of wood or &s;tone being plac'd by a wi&s;e Architect, conduces to the beauty of the mo&s;t glorious Building. But every man bearing in his own brea&s;t Affections, Pa&s;&s;ions, and Vices repugnant to this end, and no man owing any &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his Neighbour; none will &s;ubject the correction or re&s;triction of them|&s;elves to another, unle&s;s he al&s;o &s;ubmit to the &s;ame Rule. They are rough pieces of timber or &s;tone, which 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to cleave, &s;aw, or cut: This is the work of a skilful Builder, and he only is capable of e|recting a great Fabrick, who is &s;o: Magi&s;trats are Political Architects; and they only can perform the Work incumbent on them, who excel in Political Vertues. Nature, in variou&s;ly framing the minds of men, ac|cording to the variety of U&s;es in which they may be employ'd, in order to the in&s;titution and pre&s;ervation of Civil Societys, mu&s;t be our Guide, in allotting to every one his proper work. And <HI>Plato</HI> ob&s;erving this Va|riety, affirms, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the Laws of Nature cannot be more ab&s;urdly vio|lated, than by giving the Government of a People to &s;uch, as do not excel others in tho&s;e Arts and Vertues that tend to the ultimate Ends for which Governments are in&s;tituted."</Q> By this means tho&s;e who are Slaves by Nature, or render'd &s;o by their Vices, are often &s;et above tho&s;e that God and Nature had fitted for the highe&s;t Commands; and Societys which &s;ub&s;i&s;t only by order, fall into corruption, when all Order is &s;o prepo&s;terou&s;ly inverted, and the mo&s;t extreme Confu&s;ion introduc'd. This is an Evil that <HI>Solomon</HI> dete&s;ted: <HI>Folly is &s;et in great dignity, and the</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccl. 10. 7&punc;</NOTE>

Therefore if the&s;e Authors are to be tru&s;ted, what&s;oever place a Man is advanc'd to in a City, 'tis not for his own &s;ake, but for that of the City; and we are not to ask who was his Father, but what are his Vertues in relation to it. This induces a nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;tingui&s;hing between a &s;imple and a relative Inequality; for if it were po&s;&s;ible for a man to have great Vertues, and yet no way bene|ficial to the Society of which he is, or to have &s;ome one Vice that renders 'em u&s;ele&s;s, he could have no pretence to a Magi&s;tratical Power more than any other. They who are equally free, may equally enjoy their freedom; but the Powers that can only be executed by &s;uch as are endow'd with great Wi&s;dom, Ju&s;tice and Valor, can belong to none, nor be rightly confer'd upon any, except &s;uch as excel in tho&s;e Vertues. And if no &s;uch can be found, all are equally by turns to participate of the Ho|nors annex'd to Magi&s;tracy; and Law, which is &s;aid to be written Rea|&s;on, cannot ju&s;tly exalt tho&s;e, whom Nature, which is Rea&s;on, has de|pre&s;t, nor depre&s;s tho&s;e whom Nature has exalted. It cannot make Kings Slaves, nor Slaves Kings, without introducing that Evil, which, if we believe <HI>Solomon,</HI> and the Spirit by which he &s;poke, <HI>the Earth cannot bear.</HI> This may di&s;cover what Lawgivers de&s;erve to be reputed wi&s;e or ju&s;t; and what Decrees or Sanctions ought to be reputed Laws. <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> proceeding by this Rule, rather tells us who is naturally a King, than where we &s;hould find him; and after having given the highe&s;t Prai&s;es to this true natural King and his Government, he &s;ticks not to declare that of one Man, in Vertue equal or inferior to others, to be a mere Tyran|ny, even the wor&s;t of all, as it is the corruption of the be&s;t, (or, as our Author calls it, the mo&s;t Divine) and &s;uch as can be fit only for tho&s;e barbarous and &s;tupid Nations, which, tho bearing the &s;hape of Men, are little different from Bea&s;ts. Whoever therefore will from <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s words in&s;er, that Nature has de&s;ign'd one Man, or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Men, to be Lords of every Country, mu&s;t &s;hew that Man to be endow'd with all the Vertues that render him fit for &s;o great an Office, which he dos not bear for his own Plea&s;ure, Glory or Profit, but for the good of tho&s;e that are under him; and if that be not done, he mu&s;t look after other Pa|trons than <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> for his opinion.</P>

<HI>Plato</HI> dos more explicitly &s;ay, that the Civil or Politick Man, the Shep|herd,   Father, or King of the People, is the &s;ame, de&s;ign'd for the &s;ame Work, enabled to perform it by the excellency of the &s;ame Vertues, and made perfect by the infu&s;ion of the divine Wi&s;dom.

He that &s;hould pretend to the &s;ame Privileges, without the &s;ame Abilitys to perform the Works for which they are granted, would exceed the fol|ly of a Child, that takes upon him a burden which can only be born by a Giant; or the madne&s;s of one who pre&s;umes to give Phy&s;ick, and un|der&s;tands not the Art of a Phy&s;ician, thereby drawing guilt upon him|&s;elf, and death upon his Patient. It were as vain to expect that a Child &s;hould carry the Giant's burden, and that an ignorant man &s;hould give whol&s;om Phy&s;ick, as that one who lives void of all knowledg of Good, &s;hould conduct men to it. When&s;oever therefore &s;uch a Man, as is a|bove-de&s;crib'd, dos not appear, Nature and Rea&s;on in&s;truct us to &s;eek him or them who are mo&s;t like to him; and to lay &s;uch burdens upon 'em as are proportionable to their &s;trength; which is as much as to &s;ay, to prefer every man according to his merit, and a&s;&s;ign to every one &s;uch Works as he &s;eems able to accompli&s;h.</P>
<P>But that <HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> may neither be thought unrea&s;onably ad|dicted to Monarchy; nor, wholly rejecting it, to have talk'd in vain of a Monarch, that is not to be found; 'tis good to con&s;ider that this is not a &s;iction. <HI>Mo&s;es, Jo&s;hua, Samuel,</HI> and others, were &s;uch as they define; and were made to be &s;uch, by that communion with God which <HI>Plato</HI> requires: And he in all his Writings, intending the in&s;titution of &s;uch a Di&s;ciplin as &s;hould render men happy, wi&s;e and good, could take no bet|ter way to bring his Countrymen to it, than by &s;hewing 'em that Wi&s;dom, Vertue, and Purity only could make a natural difference a|mong men.</P>
<P>'Tis not my work to ju&s;tify the&s;e Opinions of <HI>Plato</HI> and his Scholar <HI>A|ri&s;totle:</HI> They were men, and, tho wi&s;e and learned, &s;ubject to error.

<P>I Am not concern'd in making good what <HI>Suarez</HI> &s;ays: A Je&s;uit may &s;peak that which is true; but it ought to be receiv'd, as from the Devil, cautiou&s;ly, le&s;t mi&s;chief be hid under it: and Sir <HI>Robert</HI>'s fre|quent prevarications upon the Scripture, and many good Authors, give rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect he may have fal&s;ify'd one, that few Prote&s;tants read, if it &s;erv'd to his purpo&s;e; and not mentioning the place, his fraud cannot ea&s;ily be di&s;cover'd, unle&s;s it be by one who has lei&s;ure to examin all his va&s;tly voluminous Writings. But as to the point in que&s;tion, that pains
<PB N="59" REF="67">
may be &s;av'd; there is nothing that can be imputed to the invention of   <HI>Suarez;</HI> for, <HI>that</HI> Adam <HI>had only an Oeconomical, not a Political Power,</HI> is not the voice of a Je&s;uit, but of Nature and common Sen&s;e: for Po|litick &s;ignifying no more in Greek, than Civil in Latin; 'tis evident there could be no Civil Power, where there was no Civil Society; and there could be none between him and his Children, becau&s;e a Civil Society is compos'd of Equals, and fortify'd by mutual compacts, which could not be between him and his Children, at lea&s;t if there be any thing of truth in our Author's Doctrin, <HI>That all Children do perpetually and ab&s;olutely de|pend upon the Will of their Father. Suarez</HI> &s;eems to have bin of another opinion; and ob&s;erving the benefits we receive from Parents, and the Ve|neration we owe to 'em to be reciprocal, he could not think any Duty could extend farther than the knowledg of the Relation upon which it was grounded; and makes a difference between the Power of a Father, before and after his Children are made free; that is in truth, before and after they are able to provide for them&s;elves, and to deliver their Parents from the burden of taking care of them. Which will appear rational to any who are able to di&s;tingui&s;h between what a Man of 50 years old, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting by him&s;elf, and having a Family of his own, or a Child of eight, dos owe to his Father: The &s;ame rea&s;on that obliges a Child to &s;ubmit intirely to the Will of his Parents, when he is utterly ignorant of all things, dos per|mit, and often enjoin men of ripe age to examin the Commands they receive before they obey them; and 'tis not more plain that I owe all manner of duty, affection, and re&s;pect to him that did beget and educate me, than that I can owe nothing on any &s;uch account to one that did neither.</P>
<P>This may have bin the opinion of <HI>Suarez:</HI> but I can hardly believe &s;uch a notion, as, <HI>that</HI> Adam <HI>in proce&s;s of time might have Servants,</HI> could proceed from any other brain than our Author's: for if he had liv'd to this day, he could have had none under him but his own Children; and if a Family be not compleat without Servants, his mu&s;t always have bin defective; and his Kingdom mu&s;t have bin &s;o too, if that has &s;uch a re|&s;emblance to a Family as our Author fancies. This is evident, that a hard Father may u&s;e his Children as Servants, or a rebellious, &s;tubborn Son may de&s;erve to be &s;o us'd; and a gentle and good Ma&s;ter may &s;hew that kindne&s;s to faithful and well-de&s;erving Servants, which re&s;embles the &s;weetne&s;s of a fatherly rule: but neither of 'em can change their nature; a Son can never grow to be a Servant, nor a Servant to be a Son. If a Family therefore be not compleat, unle&s;s it con&s;i&s;t of Chil|dren and Servants, it cannot be like to a Kingdom or City, which is compos'd of Freemen and Equals: Servants may be in it, but are not Members of it. As Truth can never be repugnant to Ju&s;tice, 'tis impo&s;|&s;ible this &s;hould be a prejudice to the paternal Rule, which is mo&s;t ju&s;t; e&s;pecially when a grateful remembrance of the benefits receiv'd, dos &s;till remain, with a nece&s;&s;ary and perpetual obligation of repaying them in all affection and duty: whereas the care of ever providing for their Familys, as they did probably increa&s;e in the time of our fir&s;t long-living Fathers, would have bin an in&s;upportable burden to Parents, if it had bin incum|bent on 'em. We do not find that <HI>Adam</HI> exercis'd any &s;uch power over <HI>Cain,</HI> when he had &s;lain <HI>Abel,</HI> as our Author fancies to be Regal: The Murderer went out, and built a City for him&s;elf, and call'd it by the name of his fir&s;t-born. And we have not the lea&s;t re&s;on to believe, that after <HI>Adam</HI>'s death <HI>Cain</HI> had any Dominion over his Brethren, or their Po&s;terity; or any one of them over him and his. He fear'd that who&s;o|ever
<PB N="60" REF="68">
  &s;aw him would kill him, which language dos not agree with the Rights belonging to the haughty Title of Heir apparent to the Dominion of the whole Earth. The like was practis'd by <HI>Noah</HI> and his Sons, who &s;et up Colonys for them&s;elves; but liv'd as privat men in ob&s;cure places, whil&s;t their Children of the fourth or fifth Generation, e&s;pecially of the younge&s;t and accur&s;ed Son, were great and powerful Kings, as is fully prov'd in the fir&s;t Chapter.</P>
<P>Tho this had bin otherwi&s;e, it would have no effect upon us; for no argument drawn from the examples of <HI>Shem, Ham,</HI> and <HI>Japhet,</HI> if they and their Children had continu'd under the Dominion of <HI>Noah</HI> as long as he liv'd, can oblige me to re&s;ign my &s;elf and all my concernments ab&s;o|lutely into the hands of one who is not my Father. But when the con|trary is evidently true in them, and their next en&s;uing Generations, 'tis an admirable boldne&s;s in our Author to think of impo&s;ing upon us for an eternal and univer&s;al Law (when the knowledg of our fir&s;t Progenitors is utterly extingui&s;h'd) that which was not at all regarded by tho&s;e, who could not be ignorant of their own Original, or the Duty thereby incumbent upon them, or their immediate Fathers then living, to whom the Rights mu&s;t have belong'd, if there had bin any &s;uch thing in nature, or that they had bin of any advantage to them: whereas in truth, if there had bin &s;uch a Law in the beginning, it mu&s;t have vani&s;h'd of it &s;elf, for want of being exercis'd in the beginning, and could not po&s;&s;ibly be reviv'd after four thou&s;and years, when no man in the world can po&s;&s;ibly know to whom the univer&s;al right of Dominion over the whole World or particular Nations dos belong; for 'tis in vain to &s;peak of a Right, when no one man can have a better Title to it than any other. But there being no precept in the Scripture for it, and the examples directed or ap|prov'd by God him&s;elf and his mo&s;t faithful Servants, being incon&s;i&s;tent with, and contrary to it, we may be &s;ure there never was any &s;uch thing; and that men being left to the free u&s;e of their own under&s;tanding, may order and di&s;po&s;e of their own Affairs as they think fit: No man can have a better title than another, unle&s;s for his per&s;onal Vertues; every man that in the judgment of tho&s;e concern'd excels in them, may be ad|vanc'd: and tho&s;e Nations that thro mi&s;take &s;et up &s;uch as are unworthy, or do not take right mea&s;ures in providing for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of men worthy, and other things nece&s;&s;ary to their welfare, may be guilty of great folly, to their own &s;hame and mi&s;ery; but can do no inju&s;tice to any in rela|tion to an hereditary Right, which can be naturally in none.</P>

<P>Yet if the Apo&s;tle had not declar'd him&s;elf &s;o fully in this Point, we might ea&s;ily have &s;een that <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Noah</HI> did leave their Children in that equality; for Fathers are ever under&s;tood to embrace all their Chil|dren with equal Affection, till the di&s;covery of per&s;onal Vertues or Vi|ces makes a difference. But the per&s;onal Vertues, that give a rea&s;onable preference of one before another, or make him more fit to govern than the others, cannot appear before he is, nor can be annex'd to any one Line: Therefore the Father cannot be thought to have given to one Man, or his De&s;cendents, the Government of his Brethren and their De&s;cen|dents.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, tho the Law of <HI>England</HI> may make one man to be &s;ole Heir of his Father, yet the Laws of God and Nature do not &s;o. All the Children of <HI>Noah</HI> were his Heirs: The Land promis'd to <HI>Abraham, I|&s;aac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> was equally divided among their Children. If the Chil|dren of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> made two Tribes, it was not as the fir&s;t-born, but by the Will of <HI>Jacob,</HI> who adopted <HI>Ephraim</HI> and <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh;</HI> and they thereby became his Sons, and obtain'd an Inheritance equal to that of the other Tribes. The Law allow'd a double Portion to the fir&s;t begotten; but this made a difference between Brothers only in <HI>proportion,</HI> whereas that between Lord and Servant is in <HI>&s;pecie,</HI> not in degree. And if our Au|thor's Opinion might take place, in&s;tead of &s;uch a divi&s;ion of the common
<PB N="63" REF="71">
Inheritance between Brothers, as was made between the Children of <HI>Ja|cob,</HI>   all mu&s;t continue for ever Slaves to one Lord; which would e&s;tabli&s;h a difference in <HI>&s;pecie</HI> between Brethren, which Nature abhors.</P>
<P>If Nature dos not make one man Lord over his Brethren, he can never come to be their Lord, unle&s;s they make him &s;o, or he &s;ubdue them. If he &s;ubdue them, it is an act of Violence, contrary to Right, which may con&s;equently be recover'd: If they make him Lord, 'tis for their own &s;akes, not for his; and he mu&s;t &s;eek their good, not his own, le&s;t, as <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> &s;ays, he degenerat from a King into a Tyrant. He therefore who would per&s;uade us, that the Dominion over every Nation dos natu|rally belong to one Man, Woman or Child, at a venture; or to the Heir, what&s;oever he or &s;he be, as to Age, Sex, or other Qualifications, mu&s;t prove it good for all Nations to be under them. But as Rea&s;on is our Nature, that can never be natural to us that is not rational. Rea&s;on gives <HI>Paria paribus,</HI> equal Power to tho&s;e who have equal Abilitys and Merit: It allots to every one the part he is mo&s;t fit to perform; and this fitne&s;s mu&s;t be equally la&s;ting with the Law that allots it. But as it can never be good for great Nations, having men among&s;t 'em of Vertue, Expe|rience, Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s, to be govern'd by Children, Fools, or vicious and wicked Per&s;ons; and we neither find that the Ver|tues requir'd in &s;uch as de&s;erve to govern them, did ever continue in any race of men, nor have rea&s;on to believe they ever will, it can never be rea&s;onable to annex the Dominion of a Nation to any one Line. We may take this upon <HI>Solomon</HI>'s word, <HI>Wo to thee, O Land, when thy King</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccl. 10. 16.</NOTE><HI>is a Child, and thy Princes eat in the morning!</HI> And I wi&s;h the experience of all Ages did not make this Truth too evident to us. This therefore can never be the Work, much le&s;s the Law of Nature; and if there be any &s;uch thing in the world, as the Dominion over a Nation in&s;eparably united to a Man and his Family, it can have no other Root than a civil or muni|cipal Law, which is not the &s;ubject of our Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Moreover, every Father's Right mu&s;t cea&s;e, when he cea&s;es to be; or be tran&s;mitted to tho&s;e, who, being al&s;o Fathers, have the &s;ame Title to it. And tho the contrary method of annexing the whole Inheritance to one Per&s;on, or expo&s;ing all his Brethren to be de&s;troy'd by his rage if they will not &s;ubmit, may conduce to the enlargement of a proud and violent Empire, as in <HI>Turky;</HI> where he that gains the Power, u&s;ually begins his Reign with the &s;laughter of his Brothers and Nephews: yet it can never agree with the piety, gentlene&s;s and wi&s;dom of the Patriarchs, or the Laws of God and Nature.</P>
<P>The&s;e thing being agreed, we need not trouble our &s;elves with the Li|mits or Definition of a Family, and as little with the Titles given to the Head of it: 'Tis all one to us, whether it be confin'd to one Roof and Fire, or extended farther; and none but &s;uch as are &s;trangers to the pra|ctice of mankind, can think that titles of Civility have a power to create a right of Dominion. Every man in Latin is call'd <HI>Dominus,</HI> unle&s;s &s;uch as are of the vile&s;t condition, or in a great &s;ubjection to tho&s;e who &s;peak to them; and yet the word &s;trictly taken, relates only to <HI>Servus,</HI> for a Man is Lord only of his Servant or Slave. The <HI>Italians</HI> are not le&s;s li|beral of the Titles of <HI>Signore</HI> and <HI>Padrone,</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of <HI>Sennor;</HI> but he would be ridiculous in tho&s;e Countrys, who thereupon &s;hould ar|rogate to him&s;elf a right of Dominion over tho&s;e who are &s;o civil. The vanity of our Age &s;eems to carry this Point a little higher, e&s;pecially a|mong the <HI>French,</HI> who put a great weight upon the word <HI>Prince;</HI> but
<PB N="64" REF="72">
  they cannot change the true &s;ignification of it; and even in their &s;en&s;e, <HI>Prince du Sang</HI> &s;ignifys no more than a chief Man of the Royal Blood, to whom they pay much re&s;pect, becau&s;e he may come to the Crown; as they at <HI>Rome</HI> do to Cardinals, who have the Power of chu|&s;ing Popes, and out of who&s;e number, for &s;ome Ages, they have bin cho|&s;en. In this &s;en&s;e did <HI>Scevola,</HI> when he was apprehended by <HI>Por&s;enna,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">T. Liv. l. 2.</NOTE>&s;ay, <HI>Trecenti conjuravimus Romanae juventutis Principes;</HI> which was ne|ver otherwi&s;e under&s;tood, than of &s;uch young Citizens as were remarka|ble among&s;t their Companions. And nothing can be more ab&s;urd than to think, if the name of Prince had carried an ab&s;olute and de&s;potical Power with it, that it could belong to three hundred in a City, that po&s;&s;e&s;t no more than a ten miles territory; or that it could have bin given to them, whil&s;t they were young, and the mo&s;t part of their Fathers, as is mo&s;t probable, &s;till living.</P>
<P>I &s;hould, like our Author, run round in a Circle, if I &s;hould refute what he &s;ays of a Regal Power in our fir&s;t Parents; or &s;hew, that the Regal, where it is, is not ab&s;olute as often as he dos a&s;&s;ert it. But having already prov'd, that <HI>Adam, Noah, Abraham, I&s;aac, Jacob,</HI> &amp;c. enjoy'd no &s;uch Power; tran&s;mitted to every one of their Sons that which they had, and they became Fathers of many great Nations, who always con|tinu'd independent on each other; I leave to our Author to prove, when and by what Law the Right of &s;ubdividing the Paternal Power was &s;top'd, and how any one or more of their De&s;cendents came to have that Power over their Brethren, which none of their immediate Children had over theirs.</P>
<P>His que&s;tion to <HI>Suarez,</HI> how and when Sons become free, favours more of Je&s;uitical Sophi&s;try, than any thing &s;aid by the Je&s;uit; but the Solu|tion is ea&s;y: for if he mean the re&s;pect, veneration and kindne&s;s proceed|ing from gratitude, it cea&s;es only with the Life of the Father to whom it is due, and the memory of it mu&s;t la&s;t as long as that of the Son; and if they had bin po&s;&s;e&s;t of &s;uch an ab&s;olute Power as he fancys, it mu&s;t have ceas'd with the rea&s;ons upon which it was grounded.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Becau&s;e the Power, of which a Father would probably have made a wi&s;e and gentle u&s;e, could not be rightly tru&s;ted in the hands of one who is not a Father; and that which tended only to the pre&s;ervation of all the Children, could not be turn'd to the increa&s;e of the Pride, Luxury and Violence of one, to the oppre&s;&s;ion of others who are equally Heirs.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd place, Societys cannot be in&s;tituted, unle&s;s the Heads of the Familys that are to compo&s;e them, re&s;ign &s;o much of their Right as &s;eems convenient into the publick Stock, to which every one becomes &s;ub|ject: But that the &s;ame Power &s;hould, at the &s;ame time, continue in the true Father, and the figurative Father, the Magi&s;trate; and that the Children &s;hould owe intire Obedience to the Commands of both, which may often cro&s;s each other, is ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>Thirdly, It cea&s;es when it cannot be executed; as when men live to &s;ee four or five Generations, as many do at this day; becau&s;e the Son cannot tell whether he &s;hould obey his Father, Grandfather, or Great-Grandfather, and cannot be equally &s;ubject to them all; mo&s;t e&s;pecially, when they live in divers places, and &s;et up Familys of their own, as the Sons of the Patriarchs did: which being ob&s;erv'd, I know no place where this Paternal Power could have any effect, unle&s;s in the fabulous I&s;land of <HI>Pines;</HI> and even there it mu&s;t have ceas'd, when he died, who,
<PB N="65" REF="73">
by the Inventor of the &s;tory, is &s;aid to have &s;een above ten thou&s;and Per|&s;ons   i&s;&s;ued of his body.</P>
<P>And if it be &s;aid, that <HI>Noah, Shem, Abraham,</HI> &amp;c. con&s;ented that their Children &s;hould go where they thought fit, and provide for them&s;elves; I an&s;wer, that the like has bin done in all Ages, and mu&s;t be done for ever. 'Tis the Voice of Nature, obey'd not only by Mankind, but by all living Creatures; and there is none &s;o &s;tupid as not to under&s;tand it. A Hen leaves her Chickens, when they can &s;eek their own nouri&s;hment: A Cow looks after her Calf no longer, than till it is able to feed: A Lion gives over hunting for his Whelps, when they are able to &s;eek their own Prey, and have &s;trength enough to provide what is &s;ufficient for them|&s;elves. And the contrary would be an in&s;upportable burden to all living Creatures, but e&s;pecially to Men; for the good order that the rational Nature delights in, would be overthrown, and Civil Societys, by which it is be&s;t pre&s;erv'd, would never be e&s;tabli&s;h'd.</P>
<P>We are not concern'd to examin, Whether the Political and Oecono|mical Powers be intirely the &s;ame, or in what they differ: for that ab&s;o|lute Power which he contends for, is purely de&s;potical, different from both, or rather incon&s;i&s;tent with either as to the &s;ame Subject; and that which the Patriarchs exercis'd, having bin equally inherited by their Chil|dren, and con&s;equently by every one of their Po&s;terity, 'tis as much as is requir'd for my purpo&s;e of proving the natural, univer&s;al Liberty of Man|kind; and I am no way concern'd in the Que&s;tion, Whether the fir&s;t Pa|rents of Mankind had a Power of Life and Death over their Children, or not.</P>

<P>THis being e&s;tabli&s;h'd, I &s;hall leave <HI>Filmer</HI> to fight again&s;t <HI>Suarez</HI> and <HI>Bellarmin;</HI> or to turn one of them again&s;t the other, without any concernment in the Combat, or the &s;ucce&s;s of it. But &s;ince he there|upon rai&s;es a Que&s;tion, <HI>Whether the &s;upreme Power be &s;o in the People, that there is but one and the &s;ame Power in all the People of the World; &s;o that no Power can be granted, unle&s;s all Men upon the Earth meet, and agree to chu&s;e a Governor:</HI> I think it de&s;erves to be an&s;wer'd, and might do it by pro|po&s;ing a Que&s;tion to him; Whether in his opinion, the Empire of the whole World dos, by the Laws of God and Nature, belong to one Man, and who that Man is? Or, how it came &s;o to be divided, as we have ever known it to have bin, without &s;uch an injury to the Univer&s;al Mo|narch, as can never be repair'd? But intending to proceed more candidly, and not to trouble my &s;elf with <HI>Bellarmin</HI> or <HI>Suarez,</HI> I &s;ay, that they who place the Power in a Multitude, under&s;tand a Multitude compos'd of Free|men, who think it for their convenience to join together, and to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch Laws and Rules as they oblige them&s;elves to ob&s;erve: which Mul|titude, whether it be great or &s;mall, has the &s;ame Right, becau&s;e ten Men are as free as ten Millions of Men; and tho it may be more prudent in &s;ome ca&s;es to join with the greater than the &s;maller number, becau&s;e there is more &s;trength, it is not &s;o always: But however, every Man mu&s;t there|in
<PB N="66" REF="74">
  be his own judg, &s;ince if he mi&s;take, the hurt is only to him&s;elf; and the ten may as ju&s;tly re&s;olve to live together, frame a Civil Society, and oblige them&s;elves to Laws, as the greate&s;t number of Men that ever met together in the World.</P>
<P>Thus we find that a few Men a&s;&s;embling together upon the Banks of the <HI>Tiber,</HI> re&s;olv'd to build a City, and &s;et up a Government among them|&s;elves: And the Multitude that met at <HI>Babylon,</HI> when their de&s;ign of building a Tower that &s;hould reach up to Heaven fail'd, and their Lan|guage was confounded, divided them&s;elves, as our Author &s;ays, into &s;e|venty two parcels, and by the &s;ame Right might have divided into more, as their De&s;cendents did into almo&s;t an infinite number before the death of their common Father <HI>Noah.</HI> But we cannot find a more perfect Picture of Freemen, living according to their own Will, than in <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Lot;</HI> they went together into <HI>Canaan,</HI> continu'd together as long as was convenient for them, and parted when their Sub&s;tance did &s;o increa&s;e, that they became trouble&s;om to each other. In the like manner <HI>I&s;mael, I&s;aac,</HI> and <HI>Abraham</HI>'s &s;ix Sons by <HI>Keturah,</HI> might have continu'd together and made one Nation; <HI>I&s;aac</HI> and <HI>E&s;au, Moab</HI> and <HI>Ammon,</HI> might have done &s;o too; or all of them that came of the &s;ame Stock might have united toge|ther; but they did not: And their De&s;cendents by the &s;ame rule might have &s;ubdivided perpetually, if they had thought it expedient for them|&s;elves: and if the Sons of <HI>Jacob</HI> did not do the like, 'tis probable they were kept together by the hope of an Inheritance promis'd to 'em by God, in which we find no &s;hadow of a de&s;potical Dominion, affected by one as Father or Heir to the fir&s;t Father, or reputed to be the Heir; but all con|tinu'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 13.</NOTE>in that fraternal equality, which according to <HI>Abraham</HI>'s words to <HI>Lot</HI> they ought to do. There was no Lord, Slave or Va&s;&s;al; no &s;trife was to be among them: They were Brethren; they might live together, or &s;eparate, as they found it convenient for them&s;elves. By the &s;ame Law that <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Lot, Moab</HI> and <HI>Ammon, I&s;mael, I&s;aac,</HI> and the Sons of <HI>Keturah, Jacob, E&s;au,</HI> and their De&s;cendents, did divide and &s;et up &s;eve|ral Governments, every one of their Children might have done the like: and the &s;ame Right remain'd to their I&s;&s;ue, till they had by agreement engag'd them&s;elves to each other. But if they had no dependence upon each other, and might live together in that fraternal equality which was between <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Lot;</HI> or &s;eparate, and continue in that &s;eparation, or reunite; they could not but have a right of framing &s;uch conditions of their union as be&s;t pleas'd them&s;elves. By this means every number of Men, agreeing together and framing a Society, became a compleat Body, having all Power in them&s;elves over them&s;elves, &s;ubject to no other hu|man Law than their own. All tho&s;e that compo&s;e the Society, being equally free to enter into it or not, no Man could have any Prerogative above others, unle&s;s it were granted by the con&s;ent of the whole: and nothing obliging them to enter into this Society, but the con&s;ideration of their own Good; that Good, or the opinion of it, mu&s;t have bin the Rule, Motive and End of all that they did ordain. 'Tis lawful therefore for any &s;uch Bodys to &s;et up one, or a few Men to govern them, or to re|tain the Power in them&s;elves; and he or they who are &s;et up, having no other Power but what is &s;o confer'd upon them by that Multitude, whe|ther great or &s;mall, are truly by them made what they are; and by the Law of their own Creation, are to exerci&s;e tho&s;e Powers according to the proportion, and to the ends for which they were given.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="75">
The&s;e Rights, in &s;everal Nations and Ages, have bin variou&s;ly execu|ted,   in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of <HI>Monarchys, Ari&s;tocracys, Democracys,</HI> or <HI>mix'd Governments,</HI> according to the variety of Circum&s;tances; and the Go|vernments have bin good or evil, according to the rectitude or pravity of their In&s;titution, and the vertue and wi&s;dom, or the folly and vices of tho&s;e to whom the Power was committed: but the end which was ever propos'd, being the good of the Publick, they only perform'd their duty, who procur'd it according to the Laws of the Society, which were equally valid as to their own Magi&s;trats, whether they were few or many.</P>
<P>This might &s;uffice to an&s;wer our Author's Que&s;tion; but he endeavours further to perplex it, by a fiction of his own brain, <HI>That God gave this Power to the whole Multitude met, and not to every particular A&s;&s;embly of Men:</HI> And expects a proof, <HI>That the whole Multitude met, and divided this Power which God gave them in gro&s;s, by breaking it into parcels, and by ap|pointing a di&s;tinct Power to each Commonwealth.</HI> He al&s;o fathers it upon the A&s;&s;ertors of Liberty; <HI>and dos not &s;ee,</HI> as he &s;ays, <HI>how there can be an Election of a Magi&s;trate by any Commonwealth, that is not an &V;&s;urpation upon the Privilege of the whole World, unle&s;s all Mankind had met together, and divided the Power into parcels which God had given them in gro&s;s.</HI> But be|fore I put my &s;elf to the trouble of an&s;wering that which is but an Ap|pendix to a whim&s;y of his own, I may ju&s;tly ask, What hurt he finds in U&s;urpation, who a&s;&s;erts, that the &s;ame Obedience is due to all Monarchs, whether they come in by Inheritance, Election or U&s;urpation? If U&s;ur|pation can give a Right to a Monarch, why dos it not confer the &s;ame up|on a People? Or rather, if God did in gro&s;s confer &s;uch a Right upon all Mankind, and they neither did, nor can meet together by con&s;ent to di&s;|po&s;e of it for the good of the whole; why &s;hould not tho&s;e who can, and do con&s;ent to meet together, agree upon that which &s;eems mo&s;t expedient to them for the Government of them&s;elves? Did God create Man under the nece&s;&s;ity of wanting Government, and all the good that proceeds from it; becau&s;e at the fir&s;t all did not, and afterwards all could not meet to agree upon Rules? Or did he ever declare, that unle&s;s they &s;hould u&s;e the fir&s;t opportunity of dividing them&s;elves into &s;uch parcels as were to re|main unalterable, the right of reigning over every one &s;hall fall to the fir&s;t Villain that &s;hould dare to attempt it? Is it not more con&s;onant to the Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s of God, to leave to every Nation a liberty of re|pairing the Mi&s;chiefs fallen upon them thro the omi&s;&s;ion of their fir&s;t Pa|rents, by &s;etting up Governments among them&s;elves, than to lay 'em un|der a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubmitting to any that &s;hould in&s;olently a&s;pire to a Do|mination over them? Is it not more ju&s;t and rea&s;onable to believe, that the univer&s;al Right not being executed, devolves upon particular Nations, as Members of the great Body, than that it &s;hould become the reward of Violence or Fraud? Or is it po&s;&s;ible that any one Man can make him&s;elf Lord of a People, or parcel of that Body, to whom God had given the liberty of governing them&s;elves, by any other means than Violence or Fraud, unle&s;s they did willingly &s;ubmit to him? If this Right be not de|volv'd upon any one Man, is not the inva&s;ion of it the mo&s;t outrageous Injury that can be done to all Mankind, and mo&s;t particularly to the Na|tion that is en&s;lav'd by it? Or if the Ju&s;tice of every Government depends nece&s;&s;arily upon an original Grant, and a Succe&s;&s;ion certainly deduc'd from our fir&s;t Fathers, dos not he by his own Principles condemn all the Mo|narchys of the World, as the mo&s;t dete&s;table U&s;urpations, &s;ince not one of 'em that we know do any way pretend to it?

<P>If our Author was ignorant of the&s;e things, which are the mo&s;t com|mon in all Hi&s;torys, he might have &s;par'd the pains of writing upon more ab&s;tru&s;e Points; but 'tis a &s;tupendous folly in him, to pre&s;ume to rai&s;e Doctrins depending upon the univer&s;al Law of God and Nature, with|out examining the only Law that ever God did in a publick manner give to Man. If he had look'd into it, he might have learnt, That all <HI>I&s;rael</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 10.</NOTE>was, by the command of God, a&s;&s;embl'd at <HI>Mi&s;peth</HI> to chu&s;e a King, and did chu&s;e <HI>Saul:</HI> He being &s;lain, all <HI>Judah</HI> came to <HI>Hebron,</HI> and made <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 2.</NOTE><HI>David</HI> their King: After the death of <HI>I&s;hbo&s;heth,</HI> all the Tribes went to <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 5.</NOTE><HI>Hebron,</HI> and anointed him King over them, and he made a Covenant with them before the Lord.

The &s;ame People in the time of the Judges, had general A&s;&s;emblys, as often as occa&s;ion did re|quire, to &s;et up a Judg, make War, or the like: And the &s;everal Tribes had their A&s;&s;emblys to treat of Bu&s;ine&s;&s;es relating to them&s;elves. The Hi|&s;torys of all Nations, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e that have peopled the be&s;t parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> are &s;o full of Examples in this kind, that no man can que&s;tion them, unle&s;s he be brutally ignorant, or maliciou&s;ly contentious. The great matters among the <HI>Germans</HI> were tran&s;acted <HI>omnium con&s;en&s;u. De</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">C. Tacit. de mor.

All the foremention'd Nor|thern Nations had the like cu&s;toms among 'em: The Governments they had were &s;o in&s;tituted. The utmo&s;t that any now remaining pretends to, is, to derive their right from them: If, according to <HI>Filmer,</HI> the&s;e fir&s;t A&s;&s;emblys could not confer it upon the fir&s;t, they had none: Such as claim under 'em, can inherit none from tho&s;e that had none; and there can be no right in all the Governments we &s;o much venerate; and nothing can tend more to their overthrow than the reception of our Author's Doctrin.</P>
<P>Tho any one In&s;tance would be &s;ufficient to overthrow his general ne|gative Propo&s;ition (for a Rule is not generally true, if there be any ju&s;t Exception again&s;t it) I have alledg'd many, and find it &s;o ea&s;y to in|crea&s;e the number, that there is no Nation, who&s;e Original we know, out of who&s;e Hi&s;torys I will not undertake to produce the like: But I have not bin &s;olicitous preci&s;ely to di&s;tingui&s;h, which Nations have acted

  in their own Per&s;ons, and which have made u&s;e of Delegats; nor in what times they have chang'd from one way to the other: for if any have act|ed by them&s;elves, the thing is po&s;&s;ible; and what&s;oever is done by dele|gated Powers, mu&s;t be refer'd to their Principals; for none can give to any a Power which they have not in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>He is graciou&s;ly pleas'd to confe&s;s, That <HI>when Men are a&s;&s;embled by a human Power, that Power that dos a&s;&s;emble them, may al&s;o limit the manner of the execution of that Power, &amp;c. But in A&s;&s;emblys that take their Au|thority from the Law of Nature, it is not &s;o; for what liberty or freedom is due to any man by the Law of Nature, no inferior Power can alter, limit or dimini&s;h: No one man, or multitude of men, can give away the natural Right of another,</HI> &amp;c. The&s;e are &s;trong Lines, and &s;uch as, if there be any &s;en&s;e in them, utterly overthrow all our Author's Doctrin; for if any A&s;&s;embly of men did ever take their Authority from the Law of Nature, it mu&s;t be of &s;uch as, remaining in the intire fruition of their natural Liberty, and re&s;train'd by no Contract, meet together to deliberate of &s;uch matters as concern them&s;elves; and if they can be re&s;trnin'd by no one man, or number of men, they may di&s;po&s;e of their own Affairs as they think fit. But becau&s;e no one of them is oblig'd to enter into the So|ciety that the re&s;t may con&s;titute, he cannot enjoy the benefit of that So|ciety unle&s;s he enter into it: He may be gone and &s;et up for him&s;elf, or &s;et up another with &s;uch as will agree with him. But if he enter into the Society, he is oblig'd by the Laws of it; and if one of tho&s;e Laws be, that all things &s;hould be determin'd by the plurality of Voices, his A&s;&s;ent is afterwards comprehended in all the Re&s;olutions of that Plurali|ty. <HI>Reuben</HI> or <HI>Simeon</HI> might, according to the Laws of Nature, have divided them&s;elves from their Brethren, as well as <HI>Lot</HI> from <HI>Abraham,</HI> or <HI>I&s;mael</HI> and the Sons of <HI>Keturah</HI> from <HI>I&s;aac;</HI> but when they, in hopes of having a part in the Inheritance promis'd to their Fathers, had join'd with their Brethren, a few of their De&s;cendents could not have a right, by their di&s;&s;ent, to hinder the Re&s;olutions of the whole Body, or &s;uch a part of it as by the fir&s;t Agreement was to pa&s;s for an Act of the whole. And the <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 10.</NOTE>Scripture teaches us, that when the Lot was fallen upon <HI>Saul,</HI> they who de&s;pis'd him were &s;til'd <HI>Men of Belial;</HI> and the re&s;t, after his Victory over the <HI>Ammonites,</HI> would have &s;lain 'em if he had permitted. In the like manner, when a number of Men met together to build <HI>Rome,</HI> any man who had di&s;lik'd the de&s;ign, might ju&s;tly have refus'd to join in it; but when he had enter'd into the Society, he could not by his Vote invalidate the Acts of the whole, nor de&s;troy the Rights of <HI>Romulus, Numa,</HI> and the others, who by the Senat and People were made Kings; nor tho&s;e of the other Magi&s;trats, who after their expul&s;ion were legally created.</P>
<P>This is as much as is requir'd to e&s;tabli&s;h the natural Liberty of Man|kind in its utmo&s;t extent, and cannot be &s;haken by our Author's &s;urmi&s;e, <HI>That a Gap is thereby open'd for every &s;editious multitude to rai&s;e a new Com|monwealth:</HI> For till the Commonwealth be e&s;tabli&s;h'd, no multitude can be &s;editious, becau&s;e they are not &s;ubject to any human Law; and Sedi|tion implies an unju&s;t and di&s;orderly oppo&s;ition of that Power which is legally e&s;tabli&s;h'd; which cannot be when there is none, nor by him who is not a Member of the Society that makes it; and when it is made, &s;uch as enter'd into it, are oblig'd to the Laws of it.</P>
<P>This &s;hewing the root and foundation of Civil Powers, we may judg of the u&s;e and extent of them, according to the letter of the Law, or the true intentional meaning of it; both which declare them to be purely

<P>His cavils concerning Proxys, and the way of u&s;ing them, de&s;erve no an&s;wer, as relating only to one &s;ort of Men among&s;t us, and can have no influence upon the Laws of Nature, or the proceedings of A&s;&s;emblys, acting according to &s;uch Rules as they &s;et to them&s;elves. In &s;ome places they have voted all together in their own per&s;ons, as in <HI>Athens:</HI> In others by Tribes, as in <HI>Rome:</HI> Sometimes by Delegats, when the number of the whole People is &s;o great, that no one place can contain them, as in the Parliaments, Diets, General A&s;&s;emblys of E&s;tates, long us'd in the great Kingdoms of <HI>Europe.</HI> In other Parts many Citys are join'd together in Leagues, as antiently the <HI>Achaians, Etolians, Samnites, Tu&s;cans;</HI> and in the&s;e times the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> and Cantons of <HI>Switzerland:</HI> but our Author not regarding &s;uch matters, in pur&s;uance of his folly, with an ignorance as admirable as his &s;tupidity, repeats his Challenge; <HI>I ask,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>but one Example out of the Hi&s;tory of the whole World; let the Common|wealth be nam'd, wherever the Multitude, or &s;o much as the major part of it, con&s;ented either by Voice or Procuration to the Election of a Prince:</HI> not ob&s;erving, that if an An&s;wer could not be given, he did overthrow the Rights of all the Princes that are, or ever have bin in the World: for if the Liberty of one Man cannot be limited or dimini&s;h'd by one, or any number of Men, and none can give away the Right of another; 'tis plain that the Ambition of one Man, or of many, a faction of Citizens, or the mutiny of an Army, cannot give a Right to any over the Libertys of a whole Nation. Tho&s;e who are &s;o &s;et up, have their root in Violence or Fraud, and are rather to be accounted Robbers and Pirats, than Magi|&s;trats. <HI>Leo Africanus</HI> ob&s;erving in his Hi&s;tory, that &s;ince the extinction <NOTE PLACE="marg">Leonis Afr. Hi&s;t.

If the Power be limited, what&s;oever is done according to that limitation, has the &s;ame Authority. If it dos there|fore appear (as is te&s;tify'd by the Laws and Hi&s;torys of all our Northern Nations) that the power of every People is either wholly, or to &s;uch a degree as is nece&s;&s;ary for creating Kings, granted to their &s;everal Gemotes, Diets, Cortez, A&s;&s;emblys of E&s;tates, Parliaments, and the like; all the Kings that they have any where, or at any time cho&s;en, do reign by the &s;ame authority, and have the &s;ame right, as if every individual Man of tho&s;e Nations had a&s;&s;ented to their Election. But that the&s;e Gemotes, Diets, and other A&s;&s;emblys of State, have every where had &s;uch Powers, and executed them by rejecting or &s;etting up Kings; and that the Kings now in being among us have receiv'd their beginning from &s;uch Acts, has bin fully prov'd, and is &s;o plain in it &s;elf, that none but tho&s;e who are gro&s;ly &s;tupid or impudent can deny it: which is enough to &s;hew that all Kings are not &s;et up by violence, deceit, faction of a few powerful Men, or the mutinys of Armys; but from the con&s;ent of &s;uch multitudes, as joining together, frame Civil Societys; and either in their own Per&s;ons at general A&s;&s;emblys, or by their Delegats, confer a ju&s;t and legal Power upon them; which our Author rejecting, he dos, as far as in him lies, prove them all to be U&s;urpers and Tyrants.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VI.   They who have a right of chu&s;ing a King, have the right of making a King.</HEAD>
<P>THO the Right of Magi&s;trats dos e&s;&s;entially depend upon the con|&s;ent of tho&s;e they govern, it is hardly worth our pains to examin, <HI>Whether the &s;ilent acceptation of a Governor by part of the People be an argu|ment of their concurring in the election of him; or by the &s;ame rea&s;on the tacit con&s;ent of the whole Commonwealth may be maintain'd:</HI> for when the que&s;tion is concerning Right, fraudulent &s;urmi&s;es are of no value; much le&s;s will it from thence follow, <HI>that a Prince commanding by Succe&s;&s;ion, Conque&s;t, or &V;&s;urpation, may be &s;aid to be elected by the People;</HI> for evident marks of di&s;&s;ent are often given: Some declare their hatred; others murmur more privatly; many oppo&s;e the Governour or Government, and &s;ucceed ac|cording to the mea&s;ure of their Strength, Virtue, or Fortune. Many would re&s;i&s;t, but cannot; and it were ridiculous to &s;ay, that the Inhabi|tants of <HI>Greece,</HI> the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> or Dutchy of <HI>Tu&s;cany,</HI> do tacitly a&s;&s;ent to the Government of the Great <HI>Turk,</HI> King of <HI>Spain,</HI> or Duke of <HI>Florence;</HI> when nothing is more certain than that tho&s;e mi&s;erable Nations abhor the Tyrannys they are under; and if they were not ma&s;ter'd by a Power much too great for them, they would &s;oon free them&s;elves. And they who are under &s;uch Governments do no more a&s;&s;ent to them, tho they may be &s;ilent, than a Man approves of being robb'd, when, with|out &s;aying a word, he delivers his Pur&s;e to a Thief that he knows to be too &s;trong for him.</P>
<P>'Tis not therefore the bare &s;ufferance of a Government when a di&s;gu&s;t is declar'd, nor a &s;ilent &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion when the power of oppo&s;ing is wan|ting, that can imply an A&s;&s;ent, or Election, and create a Right; but an explicit act of Approbation, when Men have ability and courage to re&s;i&s;t or deny. Which being agreed, 'tis evident that our Author's di&s;tinction between <HI>eligere</HI> and <HI>in&s;tituere</HI> &s;ignifys nothing: tho, if the power of in&s;ti|tuting were only left to Nations, it would be &s;ufficient; for he is in vain elected who is not in&s;tituted; and he that is in&s;tituted is certainly elected, for his In&s;titution is an Election. As the <HI>Romans</HI> who cho&s;e <HI>Romulus, Numa,</HI> and <HI>Ho&s;tilius</HI> to be Kings; and <HI>Brutus, Valerius,</HI> or <HI>Lucretius</HI> to be Con&s;uls; did make them &s;o, and their Right was &s;olely grounded up|on their Election. The Text brought by our Author again&s;t this dos fully prove it, <HI>Him &s;halt thou &s;et King over thee whom the Lord &s;hall chu&s;e;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 17.</NOTE>for God did not only make the in&s;titution of a King to be purely an act of the People, but left it to them to in&s;titute one or not, as &s;hould be&s;t plea&s;e them&s;elves: and the words, <HI>whom the Lord &s;hall chu&s;e,</HI> can have no other &s;ignification, than that the People re&s;olving to have a King, and follow|ing the Rules pre&s;crib'd by his Servant <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> he would direct 'em in their choice; which relates only to that particular People in covenant with God, and immediately under his Government, which no other was.

The <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> could not have bin three hundred years with|out a King, and then left to the liberty of making one, or not, if he by a perpetual Law had ordain'd that every Nation &s;hould have one; and it

  had bin as well impertinent as unju&s;t to deliberate who &s;hould be King, if the Dominion had by right of Inheritance belong'd to one: They mu&s;t have &s;ubmitted to him whether they would or not: No care was to be taken in the election or in&s;titution of him, who by his birth had a Right annex'd to his Per&s;on that could not be alter'd: He could not have bin forbidden <HI>to multiply Silver or Gold,</HI> who by the Law of his Creation might do what he pleas'd: It had bin ridiculous to &s;ay, <HI>he &s;hould not rai&s;e his Heart above his Brethren,</HI> who had no Brethren, that is, no Equals; but was rais'd above all by God, who had impos'd upon all others a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of obeying him.

<P>Our Author endeavouring by <HI>Hooker</HI>'s authority to e&s;tabli&s;h his di&s;tin|ction between <HI>eligere</HI> and <HI>in&s;tituere,</HI> de&s;troys it, and the paternal Right, which he makes the foundation of his Doctrine. <HI>Heaps of Scripture are alledg'd,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>concerning the &s;olemn Coronation and Inauguration of</HI> Saul, David, Solomon <HI>and others, by Nobles, Antients, and People of the Com|monwealth of</HI> I&s;rael: which is enough to prove that the whole work was theirs; that no other had any title more than what they be&s;tow'd upon him; that the Kings were &s;et up by the Nobles, Antients and People: Even God did no otherwi&s;e intervene than by &s;uch a &s;ecret di&s;po&s;ition of the Lots by his Providence, as is exercis'd in the Government of all the things in the World; and we cannot have a more certain evidence, that a paternal right to Dominion is a mere Whim&s;y, than that God did not cau&s;e the Lot to fall upon the elde&s;t, of the elde&s;t Line, of the elde&s;t Tribe; but upon <HI>Saul,</HI> a young Man, of the younge&s;t Tribe: and after|wards, tho he had de&s;ign'd <HI>David, Solomon, Jerobvam,</HI> and others, who had no pretence to the paternal Right, to be Kings, he left both the election and in&s;titution of them to the Elders and People.</P>
<P><HI>But</HI> Hooker <HI>being well examin'd, it will appear that his opinions are as contrary to the Doctrin of our Author, as tho&s;e we have mention'd out</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hooker</HI> Eccl. Pol. l. 1. c. 10.</NOTE><HI>of</HI> Plato <HI>and</HI> Ari&s;totle. <HI>He plainly &s;ays,</HI> It is impo&s;&s;ible that any &s;hould have a compleat lawful power over a multitude con&s;i&s;ting of &s;o many Familys, as eve|ry politick Society dos, but by con&s;ent of Men, or immediate appointment from God: Becau&s;e not having the natural Superiority of Fathers, their Power mu&s;t needs be u&s;urp'd, and then unlawful; or if lawful, then either granted or con|&s;ented to by them over whom they exerci&s;e the &s;ame, or el&s;e given extraordina|rily by God. <HI>And tho he thinks Kings to have bin the fir&s;t Governors &s;o con&s;tituted, he adds,</HI> That this is not the only Regiment that has bin receiv'd in the World. The inconveniences of one kind have caus'd &s;undry others to be devis'd. So that in a word, all publick Regiment, of what kind &s;oever, &s;eems evidently to have ri&s;en from deliberate advice, con&s;ultation and compo&s;i|tion between Men, judging it convenient and behoofeful. <HI>And a little below,</HI> Man's Nature &s;tanding therefore as it doth, &s;ome kind of regiment the Law of Nature dos require; yet the kinds thereof being many, Nature ties not to any one, but leaves the choice as a thing arbitrary. <HI>And again,</HI> To live by one Man's will, became all Mens mi&s;ery: This con&s;train'd them to come unto Laws, &amp;c. But as tho&s;e Laws do not only teach that which is good, but enjoin it, they have in them a con&s;training force. To con&s;train Men to any thing inconve|nient &s;eems unrea&s;onable: Mo&s;t requi&s;ite therefore it is that to devi&s;e Laws,
<PB N="75" REF="83">
which all Men &s;hould be forc'd to obey, none but wi&s;e Men &s;hould be admitted.   Moreover that which we &s;ay concerning the power of Government, mu&s;t here be apply'd to the power of making Laws, whereby to govern; which Power God has over all; and by the natural Law, whereunto he has made all &s;ubject, the lawful power of making Laws to command whole politick Societys of men, belongs &s;o properly to the &s;ame intire Societys, that for any Prince or Poten|tate, of what kind &s;oever upon Earth, to exerci&s;e the &s;ame of him&s;elf, and not either by expre&s;s commi&s;&s;ion immediately from God, or el&s;e by authority de|riv'd at the fir&s;t from their con&s;ent, upon who&s;e per&s;ons they impo&s;e Laws, it is no better than mere Tyranny. Laws therefore they are not, which publick con&s;ent has not made &s;o. <HI>The humour of our Age con&s;ider'd, I &s;hould not have ventur'd to &s;ay &s;o much: But if</HI> Hooker <HI>be a Man of &s;uch great Au|thority, I cannot offend in tran&s;cribing his words, and &s;hewing how vilely he is abus'd by</HI> Filmer; <HI>concluding, that if he be in the right, the choice and con&s;titution of Government, the making of Laws, Coro|nation, Inauguration, and all that belongs to the chu&s;ing and making of Kings, or other Magi&s;trats, is merely from the People; and that all Power exercis'd over them, which is not &s;o, is U&s;urpation and Tyranny, unle&s;s it be by an immediate Commi&s;&s;ion from God; which if any man has, let him give te&s;timony of it, and I will confe&s;s he comes not within the reach of our rea&s;onings, but ought to be obey'd by tho&s;e to whom he is &s;ent, or over whom he is plac'd.</HI></P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s our Author is of another opinion; but &s;corning to give us a rea&s;on, he adds to <HI>Hooker</HI>'s words, <HI>As if the&s;e Solemnitys were a kind of deed, whereby the right of Dominion is given; which &s;trange, untrue, and unnatural Conceits are &s;et abroad by Seed&s;men of Rebellion:</HI> And a little farther, <HI>&V;nle&s;s we will openly proclaim defiance to all Law, Equity, and Rea&s;on, we mu&s;t &s;ay (for there is no remedy) that in Kingdoms hereditary, Birthright giveth a Right to Sovereign Dominion, &amp;c. Tho&s;e Solemnitys do either &s;erve for an open te&s;tification of the Inheritor's Right, or belong to the form of inducing him into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</HI> The&s;e are bold Cen&s;ures, and do not only reach Mr. <HI>Hooker,</HI> who&s;e mode&s;ty and peaceablene&s;s of &s;pirit is no le&s;s e&s;teem'd than his Learning; but the Scriptures al&s;o, and the be&s;t of human Authors, upon which he founded his Opinions. But why &s;hould it be thought a &s;trange, untrue, or unnatural Conceit, to believe that when the Scriptures &s;ay <HI>Nimrod</HI> was the fir&s;t that grew powerful in the Earth, long before the death of his Fathers, and could con&s;equently nei|ther have a right of Dominion over the Multitude met together at <HI>Baby|lon,</HI> nor &s;ubdue them by his own &s;trength, he was &s;et up by their Con|&s;ent; or that they who made him their Governor, might pre&s;cribe Rules by which he &s;hould govern? Nothing &s;eems to me le&s;s &s;trange, than that a multitude of rea&s;onable Creatures, in the performance of Acts of the greate&s;t importance, &s;hould con&s;ider why they do them. And the infinite variety which is ob&s;erv'd in the con&s;titution, mixture, and regu|lation of Governments, dos not only &s;hew that the &s;everal Nations of the World have con&s;ider'd them; but clearly prove that all Nations have perpetually continu'd in the exerci&s;e of that Right. Nothing is more natural than to follow the voice of Mankind: The wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t have ever employ'd their &s;tudys in forming Kingdoms and Commonwealths, or in adding to the perfections of &s;uch as were already con&s;tituted; which had bin contrary to the Laws of God and Nature, if a general Rule had bin &s;et, that had oblig'd all to be for ever &s;ubject to the Will of one; and they had not bin the be&s;t, but the wor&s;t of men who had departed
<PB N="76" REF="84">
  from it. Nay, I may &s;ay, that the Law given by God to his peculiar People, and the Commands deliver'd by his Servants in order to it, or the pro&s;ecution of it, had bin contrary to his own eternal and univer&s;al Law; which is impo&s;&s;ible. A Law therefore having bin given by God, which had no relation to, or con&s;i&s;tency with the ab&s;olute paternal pow|er; Judges and Kings created, who had no pretence to any preference before their Brethren, till they were created, and commanded not to rai&s;e their Hearts above them when they &s;hould be created; the Wi&s;dom and Vertue of the be&s;t men in all ages &s;hewn in the con&s;titution or reforma|tion of Governments; and Nations in variou&s;ly framing them, pre&s;erv|ing the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their natural Right, to be govern'd by none, and in no other way than they &s;hould appoint: The opinions of <HI>Hooker, That all publick Regiment, of what kind &s;oever, ari&s;es from the deliberate advice of men &s;eeking their own good, and that all other is mere Tyranny;</HI> are not <HI>untrue and unnatural conceits &s;et abroad</HI> by the <HI>Seed&s;men of Rebellion,</HI> but real Truths grounded upon the Laws of God and Nature, acknowledg'd and practis'd by Mankind. And no Nation being ju&s;tly &s;ubject to any but &s;uch as they &s;et up, nor in any other manner than according to &s;uch Laws as they ordain, the right of chu&s;ing and making tho&s;e that are to govern them, mu&s;t wholly depend upon their Will.</P>

<DIV3 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. VII. The Laws of every Nation are the mea&s;ure of Magi&s;tratical Power.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author lays much weight upon the word <HI>Hereditary:</HI> but the que&s;tion is, What is inherited in an Hereditary Kingdom, and how it comes to be hereditary? 'Tis in vain to &s;ay <HI>the Kingdom;</HI> for we do not know what he means by the Kingdom: 'tis one thing in one place, and very different in others; and I think it not ea&s;y to find two in the World that in power are exactly the &s;ame. If he under&s;tands all that is comprehended within the precincts over which it reaches, I deny that any &s;uch is to be found in the World: If he refers to what preceding Kings enjoy'd, no determination can be made, till the fir&s;t original of that Kingdom be examin'd, that it may be known what that fir&s;t King had, and from whence he had it.</P>
<P>If this variety be denied, I de&s;ire to know whether the Kings of <HI>Spar|ta</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> had the &s;ame power over their Subjects; if the &s;ame, whe|ther both were ab&s;olute, or both limited; if limited, how came the De|crees of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Kings to pa&s;s for Laws? If ab&s;olute, how could the <HI>Spartan</HI> Kings be &s;ubject to Fines, Impri&s;onment, or the &s;entence of Death; and not to have power to &s;end for their own Supper out of the Common Hall? Why did <HI>Xenophon</HI> call <HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI> a good and faithful King, obedient to the Laws of his Country, when, upon the command of the <HI>Ephori,</HI> he left the War that he had with &s;o much glory begun in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> if he was &s;ubject to none? How came the <HI>Ephori</HI> to be e&s;tabli&s;h'd to re&s;train the Power of Kings, if it could no way be re&s;train'd, if all ow'd obedience to them, and they to none? Why did <HI>Theopompus</HI> his Wife reprove him for &s;uffering his power to be dimini&s;h'd by their crea|tion, if it could not be dimini&s;h'd? Or why did he &s;ay he had made the
<PB N="77" REF="85">
Power more permanent in making it lefs odious, if it was perpetual and   unalterable? We may go farther, and taking <HI>Xenophon</HI> and <HI>Plutarch</HI> for our guides, a&s;&s;ert that the Kings of <HI>Sparta</HI> never had the powers of War or Peace, Life and Death, which our Author e&s;teems in&s;eparable from Regality, and conclude either that no King has them, or that all Kings are not alike in power. If they are not in all places the &s;ame, Kings do not reign by an univer&s;al Law, but by the particular Laws of each Coun|try; which give to every one &s;o much power, as in the opinion of the givers conduces to the end of their In&s;titution, which is the publick good.</P>
<P>It may be al&s;o worth our inquiry how this inherited Power came to be hereditary. We know that the Sons of <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> inheri|ted the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, tho their Fathers had no &s;uch title: But having gain'd the Empire by violence, which <HI>Hooker</HI> &s;ays is mere Tyranny that can create no right, they could devolve none to their Children. The Kings of <HI>France</HI> of the three Races have inherited the Crown; but <HI>Me|roveus, Pepin,</HI> and <HI>Hugh Capet</HI> could neither pretend title nor conque&s;t, or any other Right than what was confer'd upon them by the Clergy, Nobili|ty, and People; and con&s;equently what&s;oever is inherited from them can have no other Original; for that is the gift of the People which is be|&s;tow'd upon the fir&s;t, under whom the Succe&s;&s;ors claim, as if it had bin by a peculiar Act given to every one of them. It will be more hard to &s;hew how the Crown of <HI>England</HI> is become hereditary, unle&s;s it be by the Will of the People; for tho it were granted that &s;ome of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings came in by inheritance (which I do not, having, as I think, prov'd them to have bin ab&s;olutely elective) yet <HI>William</HI> the <HI>Norman</HI> did not, for he was a Ba&s;tard, and could inherit nothing. <HI>William Rufus</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> did not; for their Elder Brother <HI>Robert</HI> by right of Inheritance ought to have bin prefer'd before 'em: <HI>Stephen</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;econd did not; for <HI>Maud</HI> the only Heire&s;s of <HI>Henry</HI> the fir&s;t was living when both were crown'd: <HI>Richard</HI> and <HI>John</HI> did not, for they were Ba&s;tards born in a|dultery. They mu&s;t therefore have receiv'd their Right from the Peo|ple, or they could have none at all; and their Succe&s;&s;ors fall under the &s;ame condition.</P>
<P>Moreover, I find great variety in the deduction of this hereditary Right. In <HI>Sparta</HI> there were two Kings of different Familys, endow'd with an equal power. If the <HI>Heraclidae</HI> did reign as Fathers of the Peo|ple, the <HI>Aeacidae</HI> did not: if the right was in the <HI>Aeacidae,</HI> the <HI>Heraclidae</HI> could have none; for 'tis equally impo&s;&s;ible to have two Fathers as two thou&s;and. 'Tis in vain to &s;ay that two Familys join'd, and agreed to reign jointly: for 'tis evident the <HI>Spartans</HI> had Kings before the time of <HI>Hercules</HI> or <HI>Achilles,</HI> who were the Fathers of the two Races. If it be &s;aid that the Regal power with which they were inve&s;ted did entitle 'em to the right of Fathers, it mu&s;t in like manner have belong'd to the <HI>Ro|man</HI> Con&s;uls, Military Tribunes, Dictators and Pretors; for they had more Power than the <HI>Spartan</HI> Kings; and that glorious Nation might change their Fathers every year, and multiply or dimini&s;h the number of 'em as they pleas'd. If this be mo&s;t ridiculous and ab&s;urd, 'tis certain that the Name and Office of King, Con&s;ul, Dictator, or the like, dos not confer any determin'd Right upon the Per&s;on that has it: Every one has a right to that which is allotted to him by the Laws of the Country by which be is created.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="86">
  As the <HI>Per&s;ians, Spartans, Romans</HI> or <HI>Germans,</HI> might make &s;uch Ma|gi&s;trats, and under &s;uch names as be&s;t pleas'd them&s;elves, and accord|ingly enlarge or dimini&s;h their Power; the &s;ame Right belongs to all Na|tions, and the Rights due unto, as well as the Dutys incumbent upon eve|ry one, are to be known only by the Laws of that place. This may &s;eem &s;trange to tho&s;e who know neither Books nor Things, Hi&s;torys nor Laws; but is well explain'd by <HI>Grotius,</HI> who denying the Sovereign Power to be annex'd to any Name, &s;peaks of divers Magi&s;trats under &s;everal names that had, and others that under the &s;ame names had it not; and di&s;tin|gui&s;hes <NOTE PLACE="marg">Grot. de Jur. bel. &amp; pac. l. 1. c. 1.</NOTE>tho&s;e who have the <HI>Summum Imperium &s;ummo modo,</HI> from tho&s;e who have it <HI>modo non &s;ummo:</HI> and tho probably he look'd on the fir&s;t &s;ort as a thing merely &s;peculative, if by that <HI>&s;ummo modo,</HI> a right of do|ing what one plea&s;es be under&s;tood; yet he gives many Examples of the other. Among tho&s;e who had <HI>liberrimum imperium,</HI> if any had it, he names the Kings of the <HI>Sabeans;</HI> who neverthele&s;s were under &s;uch a condition, that tho they were, as <HI>Agatharchidas</HI> reports, obey'd in all things, whil&s;t they continu'd within the Walls of their Palace, might be &s;ton'd by any that met 'em without it. He finds al&s;o another Ob&s;tacle to the Ab&s;olute power, <HI>Cum Rex partem habeat &s;ummi Imperii, partem Senatus, &s;ive Populus;</HI> which parts are proportion'd according to the Laws of each Kingdom, whether Hereditary or Elective, both being equally regulated by them.</P>
<P>The Law that gives and mea&s;ures the Power, pre&s;cribes Rules how it &s;hould be tran&s;mitted. In &s;ome places the &s;upreme Magi&s;trats are annu|ally elected, in others their Power is for life; in &s;ome they are merely elective, in others hereditary under certain Rules or Limitations. The antient Kingdoms and Lord&s;hips of <HI>Spain</HI> were hereditary; but the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion went ordinarily to the elde&s;t of the reigning Family, not to the neare&s;t in Blood. This was the ground of the Quarrel between <HI>Corbis</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">T. Liv. l. 28.</NOTE>the Brother, and <HI>Or&s;ua</HI> the Son of the la&s;t Prince, decided by combat be|fore <HI>Scipio.</HI> I know not whether the <HI>Goths</HI> brought that cu&s;tom with 'em when they conquer'd <HI>Spain,</HI> or whether they learnt it from the In|habitants; but certain it is, that keeping them&s;elves to the Familys of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Saavedra coro|na Gothica.</NOTE>the <HI>Balthei,</HI> and <HI>Amalthei,</HI> they had more regard to Age than Proximity; and almo&s;t ever prefer'd the Brother, or elde&s;t Kin&s;man of the la&s;t King <NOTE PLACE="marg">Marian. Hi&s;t. Hi&s;pan.</NOTE>before his Son. The like cu&s;tom was in u&s;e among the <HI>Moors</HI> in <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> who according to the &s;everal Changes that happen'd among the Familys of <HI>Almohades, Almoranides,</HI> and <HI>Benemerini,</HI> did always take one of the reigning Blood; but in the choice of him had mo&s;t re&s;pect to Age and Capacity. This is u&s;ually call'd the Law of <HI>Thane&s;try;</HI> and, as in many other places, prevail'd al&s;o in <HI>Ireland,</HI> till that Country fell under the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Government.</P>
<P>In <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Turky</HI> the Male that is neare&s;t in Blood, &s;ucceeds; and I do not know of any deviation from that Rule in <HI>France,</HI> &s;ince <HI>Henry</HI> the Fir&s;t was prefer'd before <HI>Robert</HI> his elder Brother, Grandchild to <HI>Hugh Capet:</HI> But notwith&s;tanding the great veneration they have for the Royal Blood, they utterly exclude Females, le&s;t the Crown &s;hould fall to a Stranger; or a Woman that is &s;eldom able to govern her &s;elf, &s;hould come to govern &s;o great a People. Some Nations admit Females, either &s;imply, as well as Males; or under a condition of not marrying out of their Country, or without the con&s;ent of the E&s;tates, with an ab&s;olute exclu&s;ion of them and their Children if they do; according to which Law, now in force among the <HI>Swedes, Charles Gu&s;tavus</HI> was cho&s;en King
<PB N="79" REF="87">
upon the re&s;ignation of Queen <HI>Chri&s;tina,</HI> as having no Title; and the   Crown &s;etled upon the Heirs of his Body, to the utter exclu&s;ion of his Brother <HI>Adolphus,</HI> their Mother having married a <HI>German.</HI> Tho divers Nations have differently di&s;pos'd their Affairs; all tho&s;e that are not na|turally Slaves, and like to Bea&s;ts, have prefer'd their own Good before the per&s;onal Intere&s;ts of him that expects the Crown, &s;o as upon no pre|tence whatever to admit of one who is evidently guilty of &s;uch Vices as are prejudicial to the State. For this rea&s;on the <HI>French,</HI> tho much ad|dicted to their Kings, rejected the vile remainders of <HI>Meroveus</HI> his Race, and made <HI>Pepin</HI> the Son of <HI>Charles Martel</HI> King: And when his De&s;cen|dents fell into the like Vices, they were often depos'd, till at la&s;t they were wholly rejected, and the Crown given to <HI>Capet</HI> and to his Heirs Male as formerly. Yet for all this <HI>Henry</HI> his Grandchild, being e&s;teem'd more fit to govern than his elder Brother <HI>Robert,</HI> was, as is &s;aid before, made King, and that Crown &s;till remains in his De&s;cendents; no con&s;i|deration being had of the Children of <HI>Robert,</HI> who continu'd Dukes of <HI>Burgundy</HI> during the reigns of ten Kings. And in the memory of our Fa|thers, <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Navarr</HI> was rejected by two A&s;&s;emblys of the E&s;tates, becau&s;e he differ'd in Religion from the Body of the Nation, and could never be receiv'd as King, till he had renounc'd his own, tho he was cer|tainly the next in Blood; and that in all other re&s;pects he excel'd in tho&s;e Vertues which they mo&s;t e&s;teem.</P>
<P>We have already prov'd, that our own Hi&s;tory is full of the like Ex|amples, and might enumerate a multitude of others, if it were not too tedious: and as the various Rules, according to which all the hereditary Crowns of the World are inherited, &s;hew, that none is &s;et by Nature, but that every People proceeds according to their own Will; the fre|quent deviations from tho&s;e Rules do evidently te&s;tify, that <HI>Salus Populi e&s;t Lex &s;uprema;</HI> and that no Crown is granted otherwi&s;e, than in &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to it.</P>
<P>But tho there were a Rule, which in no ca&s;e ought to be tran&s;gre&s;t, there mu&s;t be a Power of judging to whom it ought to be applied. 'Tis perhaps hard to conceive one more preci&s;e than that of <HI>France,</HI> where the elde&s;t Legitimate Male in the direct Line is prefer'd; and yet that alone is not &s;ufficient. There may be Ba&s;tardy in the ca&s;e: Ba&s;tards may be thought legitimate, and legitimate Sons Ba&s;tards. The Children born of <HI>I&s;abel</HI> of <HI>Portugal</HI> during her Marriage with <HI>John</HI> the Third of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> were declar'd Ba&s;tards; and the Title of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> to that Crown, depends upon that Declaration. We often &s;ee that Marriages which have bin contracted, and for a long time taken to be good, have bin declar'd null; and the legitimation of the pre&s;ent King of <HI>France</HI> is founded &s;olely upon the abolition of the Marriage of <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth with <HI>Marguerite</HI> of <HI>Valois,</HI> which for the &s;pace of twenty &s;even Years was thought to have bin good. Whil&s;t <HI>Spain</HI> was divided into five or &s;ix Kingdoms, and the &s;everal Kings link'd to each other by mutual Allian|ces, ince&s;tuous Marriages were often contracted, and upon better con&s;i|deration annul'd; many have bin utterly void, thro the preingagement of one of the Partys. The&s;e are not feign'd Ca&s;es, but &s;uch as happen frequently; and the diver&s;ity of Accidents, as well as the humours of Men, may produce many others, which would involve Nations in the mo&s;t fatal Di&s;orders, if every one &s;hould think him&s;elf oblig'd to follow &s;uch a one who pretended a Title, that to him might &s;eem plau&s;ible, when another &s;hould &s;et up one as plea&s;ing to others, and there were no Power
<PB N="80" REF="88">
  to terminate tho&s;e Di&s;putes to which both mu&s;t &s;ubmit, but the deci&s;ion mu&s;t be left to the Sword.</P>
<P>This is that which I call the Application of the Rule, when it is as plain and certain as human Wi&s;dom can make it; but if it be left more at large, as where Females inherit, the difficultys are inextricable: and he that &s;ays, the next Heir is really King when one is dead, before he be &s;o declar'd by a Power that may judg of his Title, dos, as far as in him lies, expo&s;e Nations to be &s;plit into the mo&s;t de&s;perate Factions, and every man to fight for the Title which he fancies to be good, till he de&s;troy tho&s;e of the contrary Party, or be de&s;troy'd by them. This is the ble&s;&s;ed way propos'd by our Author to prevent Sedition: But, God be thank'd, our Ance&s;tors found a better. They did not look upon <HI>Robert</HI> the <HI>Norman</HI> as King of <HI>England</HI> after the death of his Father; and when he did proudly endeavour, on pretence of Inheritance, to impo&s;e him&s;elf upon the Nation, that thought fit to prefer his younger Brothers before him, he paid the penalty of his folly, by the lo&s;s of his Eyes and Liberty. The <HI>French</HI> did not think the Grandchild of <HI>Pharamond</HI> to be King after the death of his Father, nor &s;eek who was the next Heir of the <HI>Merovin|gian</HI> Line, when <HI>Chilperic</HI> the Third was dead; nor regard the Title of <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Lorrain</HI> after the death of his Brother <HI>Lothair,</HI> or of <HI>Robert</HI> of <HI>Burgundy</HI> elde&s;t Son of King <HI>Robert;</HI> but advanc'd <HI>Meroveus, Pepin, Ca|pet</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the Fir&s;t, who had no other Right than what the Nobility and People be&s;tow'd upon them. And if &s;uch Acts do not de&s;troy the Pretences of all who lay claim to Crowns by Inheritance, and do not create a Right, I think it will be hard to find a lawful King in the world, or that there ever has bin any; &s;ince the fir&s;t did plainly come in like <HI>Nimrod,</HI> and tho&s;e who have bin every where &s;ince Hi&s;torys are known to us, ow'd their exaltation to the Con&s;ent of Nations, arm'd or unarm'd, by the depo&s;ition or exclu&s;ion of the Heirs of &s;uch as had reign'd before them.</P>
<P>Our Author not troubling him&s;elf with the&s;e things, or any other re|lating to the matter in que&s;tion, is pleas'd to &s;light <HI>Hooker</HI>'s Opinions concerning Coronation and Inauguration, with <HI>the heaps of Scripture</HI> up|on which he grounds them; whereas tho&s;e Solemnitys would not only have bin fooli&s;h and impertinent, but profane and impious, if they were not Deeds by which the Right of Dominion is really confer'd. What could be more wickedly &s;uper&s;titious, than to call all <HI>I&s;rael</HI> together be|fore the Lord, and to ca&s;t Lots upon every Tribe, Family and Per&s;on, for the election of a King, if it had bin known to whom the Crown did belong by a natural and unalterable Right? Or if there had bin &s;uch a thing in Nature, how could God have caus'd that Lot to fall upon one of the younge&s;t Tribe, for ever to di&s;countenance his own Law, and divert Nations from taking any notice of it? It had bin ab&s;urd for the Tribe of <HI>Judah</HI> to chu&s;e and anoint <HI>David,</HI> and for the other Tribes to follow their example after the death of <HI>I&s;hbo&s;heth,</HI> if he had bin King by a Right not depending on their Will. <HI>David</HI> did wor&s;e in &s;laying the Sons of <HI>Rim|mon,</HI> &s;aying, they had kill'd a righteous Man lying upon his bed, if <HI>I&s;h|bo&s;heth,</HI> who&s;e Head they pre&s;ented, had mo&s;t unrighteou&s;ly detain'd from him, as long as he liv'd, the Dominion of the ten Tribes: The King, Elders and People, had mo&s;t &s;cornfully abus'd the mo&s;t &s;acred things, by u&s;ing &s;uch Ceremonys in making him King, and com|pleating their Work in a Covenant made between him and them before the Lord, if he had bin already King, and if tho&s;e Acts
<PB N="81" REF="89">
had bin empty Ceremonys conferring no Right at all.  </P>
<P>I dare not &s;ay that a League dos imply an ab&s;olute equality between both Partys; for there is a <HI>Foedus inequale,</HI> wherein the weaker, as <HI>Groti|us</HI> &s;ays, dos u&s;ually obtain protection, and the &s;tronger honour; but there can be none at all, unle&s;s both Partys are equally free to make it, or not to make it. <HI>David</HI> therefore was not King, till he was elected, and tho&s;e Covenants made; and he was made King by that Election and Covenants.</P>
<P>This is not &s;haken by our Author's Suppo&s;ition, <HI>That the People would not have taken</HI> Joas, Mana&s;&s;eh <HI>or</HI> Jo&s;iah, <HI>if they had had a right of chu&s;ing a King; &s;ince</HI> Solomon <HI>&s;ays, Wo unto the Kingdom who&s;e King is a Child!</HI> For, fir&s;t, they who at the fir&s;t had a right of chu&s;ing whom they pleas'd to be King, by the Covenant made with him whom they did chu&s;e, may have depriv'd them&s;elves of the farther execution of it, and render'd the Crown hereditary even to Children, unle&s;s the Conditions come to be violated upon which it was granted. In the &s;econd place, if the Infancy of a King brings Wo upon a People, the Government of &s;uch a one can|not be according to the Laws of God and Nature; for Governments are not in&s;tituted by either for the plea&s;ure of a Man, but for the good of Nations; and their Weal, not their Wo, is &s;ought by both: And if Children are any where admitted to rule, 'tis by the particular Law of the place, grounded perhaps upon an opinion, that it is the be&s;t way to prevent dangerous Conte&s;ts; or that other ways may be found to prevent the Inconveniences that may proceed from their weakne&s;s. Thirdly, It cannot be concluded that they might not reject Children, becau&s;e they did not: Such matters require po&s;itive Proofs, Suppo&s;itions are of no value in relation to them, and the whole matter may be alter'd by par|ticular Circum&s;tances. The <HI>Jews</HI> might rea&s;onably have a great venera|tion for the Hou&s;e of <HI>David:</HI> they knew what was promis'd to that Family; and whatever re&s;pect was paid, or privilege granted on that ac|count, can be of no advantage to any other in the world. They might be farther induc'd to &s;et up <HI>Joas,</HI> in hope the defects of his Age might be &s;upplied by the Vertue, Experience and Wi&s;dom of <HI>Jehoiada.</HI> We do not know what good opinion may have bin conceiv'd of <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh</HI> when he was twelve years old; but much might be hop'd from one that had bin virtuou&s;ly educated, and was probably under the care of &s;uch as had bin cho&s;en by <HI>Hezekiah:</HI> and tho the contrary did fall out, the mi&s;chiefs brought upon the People by his wicked Reign, proceeded not from the weakne&s;s of his Childhood, but from the malice of his riper Years. And both the Examples of <HI>Joas</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;iah</HI> prove, that neither of 'em came in by their own right, but by the choice of the People. Jehoiada <HI>gather'd the</HI> Levites <HI>out of all the Citys of</HI> Judah, <HI>and the chief of the Fa|thers</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Chron. 23.</NOTE><HI>of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>and they came to</HI> Jeru&s;alem: <HI>And all the Congregation made a Covenant with the King in the Hou&s;e of God, and brought out the King's Son, and put upon him the Crown, and gave him the Te&s;timony, and made him King;</HI> whereupon they &s;lew <HI>Athaliah. And when</HI> Ammon <HI>was &s;lain,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Chron. 33.</NOTE><HI>the people of the Land &s;lew them that had con&s;pir'd again&s;t King</HI> Ammon; <HI>and the people of the Land made</HI> Jo&s;iah <HI>his Son King in his &s;tead:</HI> which had bin mo&s;t impertinent, if he was of him&s;elf King before they made him &s;o. Be&s;ides, tho Infancy may be a ju&s;t cau&s;e of excepting again&s;t, and rejecting the next Heir to a Crown, 'tis not the greate&s;t or &s;tronge&s;t. 'Tis far more ea&s;y to find a Remedy again&s;t the folly of a Child (if the State be well regulated) than the more rooted Vices of grown men.

<HEAD>SECT. VIII. There is no natural propen&s;ity in Man or Bea&s;t to Monarchy.</HEAD>
<P>I SEE no rea&s;on to believe that God did approve the Government of one over many, becau&s;e he created but one: but to the contrary, in as much he did endow him, and tho&s;e that came from him, as well the younge&s;t as the elde&s;t Line, with under&s;tanding to provide for them&s;elves, and by the invention of Arts and Sciences to be beneficial to each other; he &s;hew'd, that they ought to make u&s;e of that under&s;tanding in forming Governments according to their own convenience, and &s;uch occa&s;ions as &s;hould ari&s;e, as well as in other matters. And it might as well be infer'd, that it is unlawful for us to build, clothe, arm, defend, or nouri&s;h our &s;elves, otherwi&s;e than our fir&s;t Parents did, before or &s;oon after the Flood, as to take from us the liberty of in&s;tituting Governments that were not known to them. If they did not find out all that conduces to the u&s;e of man, but a Faculty as well as a Liberty was left to every one, and will be to the end of the World, to make u&s;e of his Wit, Indu&s;try, and Ex|perience, according to pre&s;ent Exigences, to invent and practi&s;e &s;uch things as &s;eem convenient to him&s;elf and others in matters of the lea&s;t impor|tance; it were ab&s;urd to imagin, that the political Science, which of all
<PB N="83" REF="91">
others is the mo&s;t ab&s;tru&s;e and variable according to Accidents and Cir|cum&s;tances,   &s;hould have bin perfectly known to them who had no u&s;e of it; and that their De&s;cendents are oblig'd to add nothing to what they practis'd. But the rea&s;on given by our Author to prove this extravagant fancy, is yet more ridiculous than the thing it &s;elf; <HI>God,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>&s;hew'd his opinion,</HI> viz. that all &s;hould be govern'd by one, <HI>when he endow'd not only Men, but Bea&s;ts with a natural propen&s;ity to Monarchy: Neither can it be doubted, but a natural propen&s;ity is refer'd to God who is the Author of Nature:</HI> Which I &s;uppo&s;e may appear if it be con&s;ider'd.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s I cannot but commend him in the fir&s;t place for intro|ducing God &s;peaking &s;o mode&s;tly, not declaring his Will, but his Opi|nion. He puts haughty and maje&s;tick Language into the mouth of Kings. They command and decide, as if they were &s;ubject to no Error, and their Will ought to be taken for perpetual Laws; but to God he a&s;cribes an humble delivery of his Opinion only, as if he fear'd to be mi&s;taken. In the &s;econd place, I deny that there is any &s;uch general propen&s;ity in Man or Bea&s;t, or that Monarchy would thereby be ju&s;tify'd tho it were found in them. It cannot be in Bea&s;ts, for they know not what Govern|ment is; and being uncapable of it, cannot di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;everal &s;orts, nor con&s;equently incline to one more than another. <HI>Salma&s;ius</HI> his &s;tory of Bees is only fit for old Women to prate of in Chimny-corners; and they who repre&s;ent Lions and Eagles as Kings of Birds and Bea&s;ts, do it only to &s;how, that their Power is nothing but bruti&s;h Violence, exercis'd in the de&s;truction of all that are not able to oppo&s;e it, and that has nothing of goodne&s;s or ju&s;tice in it: which Similitude (tho it &s;hould prove to be in all re&s;pects adequate to the matter in que&s;tion) could only &s;hew, that tho&s;e who have no &s;en&s;e of Right, Rea&s;on or Religion, have a natural propen|&s;ity to make u&s;e of their &s;trength to the de&s;truction of &s;uch as are weake<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> than they; and not that any are willing to &s;ubmit, or not to re&s;i&s;t it if they can; which I think will be of no great advantage to Monarchy. But whatever propen&s;ity may be in Bea&s;ts, it cannot be attributed gene|rally to Men; for if it were, they never could have deviated from it, un|le&s;s they were violently put out of their natural cour&s;e; which in this ca&s;e cannot be, for there is no Power to force them. But that they have mo&s;t frequently deviated, appears by the various Forms of Government e&s;tabli&s;h'd by them. There is therefore no natural propen&s;ity to any one, but they chu&s;e that which in their judgment &s;eems be&s;t for them. Or, if he would have that incon&s;iderate impul&s;e, by which bruti&s;h and ignorant men may be &s;way'd when they know no better, to pa&s;s for a Propen&s;ity; others are no more oblig'd to follow it, than to live upon Acorns, or inhabit hollow Trees, becau&s;e their Fathers did it when they had no better dwel|lings, and found no better nouri&s;hment in the uncultivated World. And he that exhibits &s;uch Examples, as far as in him lies, endeavours to take from us the u&s;e of Rea&s;on, and, extingui&s;hing the light of it, to make us live like the wor&s;t of Bea&s;ts, that we may be fit Subjects to ab&s;olute Monarchy. This may perhaps be our Author's intention, having learn'd from <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> that &s;uch a Government is only &s;utable to the nature of the mo&s;t be&s;tial men, who being uncapable of governing them&s;elves, fall un|der the Power of &s;uch as will take the conduct of 'em: But he ought with|al to have remember'd, that, according to <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s opinion, this Con|ductor mu&s;t be in nature different from tho&s;e he takes the charge of; and if he be not, there can be no Government, nor Order, by which it &s;ub|&s;i&s;ts: Bea&s;ts follow Bea&s;ts, and the blind lead the blind to de&s;truction.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="92">
  But tho I &s;hould grant this Propen&s;ity to be general, it could not be imputed to God, &s;ince man by Sin is fallen from the Law of his Creation. <HI>The wickedne&s;s of man</HI> (even in the fir&s;t Ages) <HI>was great in the World: All the imaginations of his heart are evil, and that continually. All men are liars: There is none that doth good, no not one. Out of the heart proceed evil Thoughts, Murders, Adulterys, Fornications, Thefts, fal&s;e Te&s;timonys,</HI> &amp;c. The&s;e are the Fruits of our corrupted nature, which the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erving, dos not only make a difference between the natural and the &s;piritual Man, who&s;e proceeding only can be refer'd to God, and that on|ly &s;o far as he is guided by his Spirit; but &s;hews, that the natural man is in a perpetual enmity again&s;t God, without any po&s;&s;ibility of being re|concil'd to him, unle&s;s by the de&s;truction of the old Man, and the rege|nerating or renewing him thro the Spirit of Grace. There being no foot|&s;teps of this in our Author's Book, he and his Ma&s;ter <HI>Heylin</HI> may have differ'd from the Apo&s;tle, referring that Propen&s;ity of Nature to God, which he declares to be utter enmity again&s;t him; and we may conclude, that this Propen&s;ity, however general it may be, cannot be attributed to God as the Author of Nature, &s;ince it cannot be more general than the Corruptions into which we are fallen.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IX. The Government in&s;tituted by God over the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> was Ari&s;tocratical.</HEAD>
<P>NOtwith&s;tanding all this, our Author is re&s;olv'd that Monarchy mu&s;t be from God: <HI>What form of Government,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>God ordain'd by his Authority, may be gather'd by that Commonwealth which he in&s;tituted a|mongst the</HI> Hebrews; <HI>which was not Ari&s;tocratical, as</HI> Calvin <HI>&s;ays, but plainly Monarchical.</HI> I may in as few words deny the Government &s;et up by God to have bin Monarchical, as he a&s;&s;erts it; but finding &s;uch Lan|guage ordinarily to proceed from a mixture of folly, impudence and pride, I chu&s;e rather to &s;hew upon what I ground my Opinions, than nakedly to deliver them; mo&s;t e&s;pecially, when by in&s;i&s;ting upon the Government in&s;tituted by God over his People, he refers us to the Scripture. And I do this the more boldly, &s;ince I follow <HI>Calvin</HI>'s Expo&s;ition, and believe that he having bin highly e&s;teem'd for his Wit, Judgment, and Learning, by &s;uch as were endow'd with the like, and reverenc'd as a glorious Ser|vant of God, might, if he were now alive, comfort him&s;elf, tho he had the misfortune to fall under the cen&s;ures of <HI>Filmer</HI> and his followers. 'Tis probable he gave &s;ome Rea&s;ons for his Opinions; but our Author having maliciou&s;ly conceal'd 'em, and I not having lea&s;ure at pre&s;ent to examin all his Writings to find 'em, mu&s;t content my &s;elf with &s;uch as my &s;mall under&s;tanding may &s;ugge&s;t, and &s;uch as I have found in ap|proved Authors.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place I may &s;afely &s;ay, he was not alone of that opinion: <HI>Jo&s;ephus, Philo,</HI> and <HI>Mo&s;es Maimonides,</HI> with all the be&s;t of the Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian Authors, had long before deliver'd the &s;ame. <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.

<PB N="85" REF="93">
to God nor his Word, but to the fury of the &s;inful People. <HI>Abarbe|nel</HI>   &s;ays, it proceeded from their delight in the Idolatry to which their <NOTE PLACE="marg">Abar. in 1 Sam. 8.</NOTE>Neighbours were addicted, and which could be upheld only by a Go|vernment, in practice and principle contrary to that which God had in|&s;tituted. <HI>Maimonides</HI> frequently &s;ays the &s;ame thing, grounded upon the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Maim. More-Nevochim.</NOTE>words of <HI>Ho&s;ea, I gave them Kings in my Wrath;</HI> and who&s;oever will call that a divine In&s;titution, may give the &s;ame name to Plagues or Fa|mines, and induce a nece&s;&s;ity incumbent upon all men to go and &s;earch the one where they may find it, and to leave their Lands for ever unculti|vated that they may be &s;ure of the other: which being too be&s;tial to be a&s;&s;erted by a man, I may &s;afely &s;ay the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Kings were not in&s;tituted by God, but given as a puni&s;hment of their Sin, who de&s;pis'd the Go|vernment he had in&s;tituted: and the above-mention'd Authors agree in the &s;ame thing, calling the Peoples de&s;ire to have a King, furious, mad, wicked, and proceeding from their love to the Idolatry of their Neigh|bours, which was &s;uted to their Government; both which were incon&s;i|&s;tent with what God had e&s;tabli&s;h'd over his own People.</P>
<P>But waving the opinions of men, 'tis good to &s;ee what we can learn from the Scripture, and inquire if there be any Precept there expre&s;ly commanding them to make a King; or any Example that they did &s;o whil&s;t they continu'd obedient to the Word of God; or any thing from whence we may rea&s;onably infer they ought to have done it: all which, if I mi&s;take not, will be found directly contrary.</P>
<P>The only Precept that we find in the Law concerning Kings, is that of <HI>Deut.</HI> 17. already mention'd; and that is not a Command to the People to make, but In&s;tructions what manner of King they &s;hould make if they de&s;ir'd to have one: There was therefore none at all.</P>
<P>Examples do as little favour our Author's A&s;&s;ertions. <HI>Mo&s;es, Jo&s;hua,</HI> and the other Judges, had not the name or power of Kings: They were not of the Tribe to which the Scepter was promis'd: They did not tran&s;|mit the Power they had to their Children, which in our Adver&s;ary's opi|nion is a Right in&s;eparable from Kings; and their Power was not conti|nu'd by any kind of Succe&s;&s;ion, but created occa&s;ionally, as need requir'd, according to the Vertues di&s;cover'd in tho&s;e who were rais'd by God to deliver the Nation in the time of their di&s;tre&s;s; which being done, their Children lay hid among the re&s;t of the People. Thus were <HI>Ehud, Gide|on, Jephtha,</HI> and others &s;et up: <HI>Who&s;oever will give battel</HI> (&s;ay the Prin|ces <NOTE PLACE="marg">Judg. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>and People of <HI>Gilead) to the Children of</HI> Ammon, <HI>&s;hall be head over the Inheritance of</HI> Gilead: and finding <HI>Jephtha</HI> to be &s;uch a man as they &s;ought, they made him their Chief, and all <HI>I&s;rael</HI> follow'd them. When <HI>Othniel</HI> had &s;hew'd his Valour in taking <HI>Kiriath Sepher,</HI> and delivering his Bre|thren from <HI>Cu&s;han-Ri&s;hathaim,</HI> he was made Judg: When <HI>Ehud</HI> had kill'd <HI>Eglon;</HI> when <HI>Shamgar</HI> and <HI>Sam&s;on</HI> had de&s;troy'd great numbers of the <HI>Phili&s;tins;</HI> and when <HI>Gideon</HI> had defeated the <HI>Midianites,</HI> they were &s;it to be advanc'd above their Brethren. The&s;e Dignitys were not inhe|rent in their Per&s;ons or Familys, but confer'd upon them; nor confer'd, that they might be exalted in Riches and Glory, but that they might be Mini&s;ters of Good to the People. This may ju&s;tify <HI>Plato</HI>'s opini|on, that if one man be found incomparably to excel all others in the Vertues that are beneficial to Civil Societys, he ought to be advanc'd a|bove all: but I think it will be hard from thence to deduce an Argument in favour of &s;uch a Monarchy as is nece&s;&s;arily to de&s;cend to the next in Blood, whether Man, Woman, or Child, without any con&s;ideration of
<PB N="86" REF="94">
  Vertue, Age, Sex, or Ability; and that failing, it can be of no u&s;e to our Author. But whatever the dignity of a <HI>Hebrew</HI> Judg was, and how|&s;oever he was rais'd to that Office, it certainly differ'd from that of a King. <HI>Gideon</HI> could not have refus'd to be a King when the People would have made him &s;o, if he had bin a King already; or that God from the beginning had appointed they &s;hould have one: The Elders and People <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 8.</NOTE>could not have ask'd a King of <HI>Samuel,</HI> if he had bin King; and he could not without impiety have bin di&s;pleas'd with them for asking &s;uch a one as God had appointed; neither would God have &s;aid to him, <HI>They have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me that I &s;hould not reign over them,</HI> if he had ordain'd what they de&s;ir'd.</P>
<P>They did not indeed reject God with their Mouths: They pretended to u&s;e the liberty he had given them to make a King; but would have &s;uch a one as he had forbidden: They drew near to him with their Lips, but their Hearts were far from him; and he &s;eeing their Hypocri&s;y, &s;e|verely cha&s;tis'd 'em in granting their ill conceiv'd reque&s;t; and foretold the Mi&s;erys that &s;hould thereupon befal 'em, from which he would not deliver 'em, tho they &s;hould cry to him by rea&s;on of what they &s;uf|fer'd from their King&punc; He was their Creature, and the mi&s;chiefs thereby brought upon them were the fruits of their own labour.</P>
<P>This is that which our Author calls God's in&s;titution of Kings; but the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ho&s;. 13.</NOTE>Prophet explains the matter much better, <HI>I gave them Kings in my anger, and took them away in my wrath:</HI> in de&s;troying them God brought de&s;olati|on upon the people that had &s;inn'd in asking for them, and following their example in all kind of Wickedne&s;s. This is all that our Author has to boa&s;t of: but God who acknowledges tho&s;e works only to be his own, which proceed from his goodne&s;s and mercy to his People, di&s;owns this; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ho&s;. 8.</NOTE><HI>I&s;rael hath ca&s;t off the thing that is good</HI> (even the Government that he had e&s;tabli&s;h'd) <HI>the Enemy &s;hall pur&s;ue him: They have &s;et up Kings, but not by me; and Princes, but I know them not.</HI> As if he &s;ought to ju&s;tify the &s;everity of his Judgments brought upon them by the wickedne&s;s of their Kings, that they, not he, had ordain'd.</P>
<P>Having &s;een what Government God did not ordain, it may be &s;ea&s;ona|ble to examin the Nature of the Government which he did ordain; and we &s;hall ea&s;ily find that it con&s;i&s;ted of three parts, be&s;ides the Magi&s;trats of the &s;everal Tribes and Citys. They had a chief Magi&s;trat, who was <NOTE PLACE="marg">Numb. 11.</NOTE>call'd Judg or Captain, as <HI>Jo&s;hua, Gideon,</HI> and others; a Council of &s;e|venty cho&s;en men; and the General A&s;&s;emblys of the People.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t was merely occa&s;ional, like to the Dictators of <HI>Rome:</HI> and as the <HI>Romans</HI> in times of danger frequently cho&s;e &s;uch a Man as was much e&s;teem'd for Valour and Wi&s;dom, God's peculiar People had a peculiar re|gard to that Wi&s;dom and Valour which was accompanied with his Pre|&s;ence, hoping for deliverance only from him.</P>
<P>The &s;econd is known by the name of the Great <HI>Sanhedrin,</HI> which be|ing in&s;tituted by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> according to the command of God, continu'd, till they were all &s;ave one &s;lain by <HI>Herod.</HI> And the third part, which is the A&s;&s;embly of the People, was &s;o common, that none can be ignorant of it, but &s;uch as never look'd into the Scripture. When the Tribes of <HI>Reu|ben, Gad,</HI> and half that of <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh</HI> had built an Altar on the &s;ide of <HI>Jor|dan,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jo&s;h. 22.</NOTE><HI>The whole Congregation of the Children of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>gather'd together at</HI> Shiloh <HI>to go up to war again&s;t them, and &s;ent</HI> Phineas <HI>the Son of</HI> Eleazer, <HI>and with him ten Princes,</HI> &amp;c. This was the highe&s;t and mo&s;t important action that could concern a People, even War or Peace, and that not

with Strangers, but their own Brethren. <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> was then alive: The   Elders never fail'd: yet this was not tran&s;acted by him or them, but by the collected body of the People; <HI>for They &s;ent Phineas.</HI> This Demo|cratical Emba&s;&s;y was Democratically receiv'd: It was not directed to one Man, but to all the Children of <HI>Reuben, Gad,</HI> and <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh,</HI> and the An&s;wer was &s;ent by them all; which being plea&s;ing to <HI>Phineas,</HI> and the ten that were with him, they made their report to the Congregation, and all was quiet.</P>
<P>The la&s;t eminent Act perform'd by <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> was the calling of a like A&s;|&s;embly to <HI>Shechem,</HI> compos'd of Elders, Heads of Familys, Judges, Of|ficers, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jo&s;. 24.</NOTE>and all the People, to whom he propos'd, and they agreeing made a Covenant before the Lord.</P>
<P><HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> being dead, the Proceedings of every Tribe were grounded up|on Coun&s;els taken at &s;uch A&s;&s;emblys among them&s;elves for their own concerns, as appears by the Actions of <HI>Judah, Simeon,</HI> &amp;c. again&s;t the <HI>Canaanites;</HI> and when the <HI>Levite</HI> complain'd that his Wife had bin forc'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">Judg. 1.</NOTE>by tho&s;e of <HI>Gibeah,</HI> the whole Congregation of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> met together at <HI>Mi&s;peth</HI> from all parts, <HI>even from</HI> Dan <HI>to</HI> Beer&s;heba, as one man, and there re&s;olv'd upon that terrible War which they made again&s;t the Tribe of <HI>Benjamin.</HI> The like A&s;&s;embly was gather'd together for the election of <HI>Saul,</HI> every man was there: and tho the Elders only are &s;aid to have ask'd a King of <HI>Samuel,</HI> they &s;eem to have bin deputed from the whole Congregation; for God &s;aid, <HI>Hearken to the Voice of the People.</HI> In the <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 8. 7.</NOTE>&s;ame manner the Tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> and after that the re&s;t, cho&s;e and a|nointed <HI>David</HI> to be their King. After the death of <HI>Solomon</HI> all <HI>I&s;rael</HI> met together to treat with <HI>Rehoboam;</HI> and not receiving &s;atisfaction from him, ten of the Tribes abrogated his Kingdom.</P>
<P>If the&s;e Actions were con&s;ider'd &s;ingly by them&s;elves, <HI>Calvin</HI> might have given the name of a Democracy to the Hebrew Government, as well as to that of <HI>Athens;</HI> for without doubt they evidently manife&s;t the &s;u|preme Power to have bin in the &s;upreme manner in the&s;e General A&s;&s;em|blys: but the Government (as to its outward order) con&s;i&s;ting of tho&s;e three parts, which comprehend the three &s;imple <HI>&s;pecies;</HI> and no times having bin appointed, nor occa&s;ions &s;pecify'd, upon which Judges &s;hould be cho&s;en, or the&s;e A&s;&s;emblys call'd, whereas the <HI>Sanhedrim,</HI> which was the Ari&s;tocratical part, was permanent; the whole might rightly be call'd an Ari&s;tocracy, that part prevailing above the others: and tho <HI>Jo|&s;ephus</HI> calls it a Theocracy, by rea&s;on of God's pre&s;ence with his People; yet in relation to man he calls it an Ari&s;tocracy, and &s;ays that <HI>Saul</HI>'s fir&s;t Sin by which he fell from the Kingdom was, that <HI>Gubernationem optimatum &s;u&s;tulit;</HI> which could not be, if they were govern'd by a Monarch before he was cho&s;en.</P>
<P>Our Author taking no notice of the&s;e matters, fir&s;t endeavours to prove the excellency of Monarchy from natural in&s;tinct; and then begging the que&s;tion, &s;ays, that God did always govern his People by Monarchy: whereas he ought in the fir&s;t place to have ob&s;erv'd that this in&s;tinct (if there be any &s;uch thing) is only an irrational appetite, attributed to Bea&s;ts, that know not why they do any thing; and is to be follow'd only by tho&s;e men who being equally irrational, live in the &s;ame igno|rance: and the &s;econd being prov'd to be ab&s;olutely fal&s;e by the ex|pre&s;s words of the Scripture, <HI>There was then no King in</HI> I&s;rael, &s;eve|ral <NOTE PLACE="marg">Judg. 18.</NOTE>times repeated, and the whole &s;eries of the Hi&s;tory, he has no other eva&s;ion than to &s;ay, <HI>That even then the</HI> I&s;raelites <HI>were under the</HI>

  <HI>Kingly Government of the Fathers of particular Familys.</HI></P>
<P>It appears by the foremention'd Text cited al&s;o by our Author, that in the A&s;&s;embly of the People, gather'd together to take coun&s;el concerning the War again&s;t <HI>Benjamin,</HI> were four hundred thou&s;and Footmen that drew Sword: They all aro&s;e together, &s;aying, Not a man of us &s;hall go to his Tent. <HI>So all the men of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>were gather'd together again&s;t the City.</HI> This is repeated &s;everal times in the relation. The <HI>Benjamites</HI> proceeded in the like manner in preparing for their defence; and if all the&s;e who did &s;o meet to con&s;ult and determin were Monarchs, there were then in <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and <HI>Benjamin</HI> four hundred twenty &s;ix thou&s;and &s;even hundred Monarchs or Kings, tho the Scripture &s;ays there was not one.</P>
<P>If yet our Author in&s;i&s;ts upon his notion of Kingly Government, I de|&s;ire to know who were the Subjects, if all the&s;e were Kings; for the Text &s;ays, that the <HI>whole Congregation was gather'd together as one man from</HI> Dan <HI>to</HI> Beer&s;heba. If there can be &s;o many Kings without one Subject, what becomes of the Right of <HI>Abraham, I&s;aac</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> that was to have bin devolv'd upon one Man as Heir to them, and thereby Lord of all? If e|very man had an equal part in that inheritance, and by virtue of it be|came a King, why is not the &s;ame eternally &s;ubdivided to as many men as are in the World, who are al&s;o Kings? If this be their natural condi|tion, how comes it to be alter'd, till they dethrone them&s;elves by con&s;ent, to &s;et up one or more to have a power over them all? Why &s;hould they deve&s;t them&s;elves of their natural Right to &s;et up one above them|&s;elves, unle&s;s in con&s;ideration of their own good? If the 426700 Kings might retain the power in them&s;elves, or give it to one, why might they not give it to any &s;uch number of men as &s;hould be&s;t plea&s;e them&s;elves, or retain it in their own hands, as they did till the days of <HI>Saul;</HI> or frame, limit, and direct it according to their own plea&s;ure? If this be true, God is the Author of Democracy; and no a&s;&s;ertor of human Li|berty did ever claim more than the People of God did enjoy and exerci&s;e at the time when our Author &s;ays they were under the Kingly Govern|ment; which Liberty being not granted by any peculiar conce&s;&s;ion or in|&s;titution, the &s;ame mu&s;t belong to all Mankind.</P>
<P>'Tis in vain to &s;ay the 426700 men were heads of Familys; for the Scripture only &s;ays, <HI>They were Footmen that drew the Sword,</HI> or rather all the men of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> from <HI>Dan</HI> to <HI>Beer&s;heba,</HI> who were able to make War. When &s;ix hundred <HI>Benjamites</HI> did only remain of the 26700, 'tis plain that no more were left of that Tribe, their Women and Children having bin de&s;troy'd in the Citys after their defeat. The next Chapter makes the matter yet more plain; for when all that were at the Congregation in <HI>Mi&s;peth</HI> were found to have &s;worn, they would not give their Daughters to any of the Tribe of <HI>Benjamin,</HI> no <HI>I&s;raelite</HI> was free from the Oath, but <NOTE PLACE="marg">J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">dg. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">1.</NOTE>the men of <HI>Jabe&s;h Gilead,</HI> who had not bin at the A&s;&s;embly: All the re&s;t of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> was therefore comprehended; and they continuing to govern in a popular way with ab&s;olute power, &s;ent twelve thou&s;and of their mo&s;t valiant men to de&s;troy all the Males of <HI>Jabe&s;h Gilead,</HI> and the Women that had lain by Man, re&s;erving the Virgins for the <HI>Benjamites.</HI> This is enough for my purpo&s;e: for the que&s;tion is not concerning the power that every Hou&s;holder in <HI>London</HI> has over his Wife, Children and Servants; but whether they are all perpetually &s;ubject to one man and Family; and I intend not to &s;et up their Wives, Prentices, and Children again&s;t them, or to dimini&s;h their Rights, but to a&s;&s;ert them, as the gift of God and Nature, no otherwi&s;e to be re&s;train'd than by Laws made with their own con&s;ent.</P>

Rea&s;on failing, our Author plea&s;es him&s;elf with terms of his own In|vention:   <HI>When the People beg'd a King of</HI> Samuel, <HI>they were govern'd by a Kingly power: God out of a &s;pecial love and care to the Hou&s;e of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>did chu&s;e to be their King him&s;elf, and did govern them at that time by his Vice|roy</HI> Samuel <HI>and his Sons.</HI> The behaviour of the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> towards <HI>Samuel</HI> has bin thought proud, perver&s;e, and ob&s;tinate; but the fine Court-word <HI>begging</HI> was never before apply'd to them; and their in&s;olent fury was not only &s;een again&s;t <HI>Samuel,</HI> but again&amp;;st God; <HI>They have not rejected thee,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 8.</NOTE><HI>but they have rejected me.</HI> And I think <HI>Filmer</HI> is the fir&s;t who ever found that Beggars in begging did reject him of whom they beg'd: Or if they were Beggars, they were &s;uch as would not be denied; for after all that <HI>Samuel</HI> had &s;aid to di&s;&s;uade them from their wicked de&s;ign, they &s;aid, <HI>Nay, but we will have a King.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ver. 19.</NOTE></P>
<P>But le&s;t I &s;hould be thought too much inclin'd to contradict our Au|thor, I confe&s;s that once he has happen'd to be in the right. <HI>God out of a &s;pecial love to the Hou&s;e of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>cho&s;e to be their King: He gave them Laws, pre&s;crib'd a Form of Government, rais'd up Men in a wonderful man|ner to execute it, fill'd them with his Spirit, was ever pre&s;ent when they call'd up|on him: He gave them coun&s;el in their doubts, and a&s;&s;istance in all their ex|tremitys: He made a Covenant with them, and would be exalted by them.</HI> But what is this to an earthly Monarch? Who can from hence derive a Right to any one man to play the Lord over his Brethren, or a rea&s;on why any Nation &s;hould &s;et him up? God is our Lord by right of creation, and our only Lord, becau&s;e he only has created us. If any other were equal to him in Wi&s;dom, Power, Goodne&s;s, and Beneficence to us, he might challenge the &s;ame duty from us. If growing out of our &s;elves, re|ceiving being from none, depending on no providence, we were offer'd the protection of a Wi&s;dom &s;ubject to no error, a Goodne&s;s that could never fail, and a Power that nothing could re&s;i&s;t; it were rea&s;onable for us to enter into a Covenant, &s;ubmit our &s;elves to him, and with all the facultys of our minds to addict our &s;elves to his Service. But what Right can from hence accrue to a mortal Creature like to one of us, from whom we have receiv'd nothing, and who &s;tands in need of help as much as we? Who can from hence deduce an argument to per&s;uade us to depend upon his Wi&s;dom, who has as little as other men? To &s;ubmit to his Will who is &s;ubject to the &s;ame Frailtys, Pa&s;&s;ions, and Vices with the re&s;t of Mankind? Or to expect protection and defence from him who&s;e life depends upon as &s;lender threds as our own; and who can have no power but that which we confer upon him? If this cannot be done, but is of all things the mo&s;t contrary to common &s;en&s;e, no man can in him&s;elf have any right over us; we are all as free as the four hundred twenty &s;ix thou&s;and &s;even hundred Hebrew Kings: We can naturally owe allegiance to none; and I doubt whether all the lu&s;ts that have reign'd among&s;t Men &s;ince the beginning of the World, have brought more guilt and mi&s;ery upon them than that prepo&s;terous and impudent pretence of imitating what God had in&s;tituted.

<P>OUR Author well ob&s;erves that <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> is hardly brought to give a general opinion in favour of Monarchy, as if it were the be&s;t form of Government, or to &s;ay true, never dos it. He u&s;es much caution, propo&s;es conditions and limitations, and makes no deci&s;ion but accord|ing to circum&s;tances. Men of Wi&s;dom and Learning are &s;ubject to &s;uch doubts; but none ought to wonder if &s;tupidity and ignorance defend <HI>Fil|mer</HI> and his Followers from them; or that their hatred to the antient Vertue &s;hould give 'em an aver&s;ion to the Learning that was the Nur&s;e of it. Tho&s;e who neither under&s;tand the &s;everal Species of Government, nor the various Tempers of Nations, may without fear or &s;hame give their opinions in favour of that which be&s;t plea&s;es them; but wi&s;e men will always proportion their prai&s;es to the merit of the Subject, and never commend that &s;imply which is good only according to circum&s;tances. <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> highly applauds Monarchy, when the Monarch has more of tho&s;e Vertues that tend to the good of a Commonwealth, than all they who compo&s;e it. This is the King mention'd in his <HI>Ethicks,</HI> and extol'd in his <HI>Politicks:</HI> He is above all by Nature, and ought not by a muni|cipal Law to be made equal to others in Power: He ought to go|vern, becau&s;e 'tis better for a People to be govern'd by him, than to enjoy their Liberty; or rather, they do enjoy their Liberty, which is never more &s;afe, than when defended by one who is a liv|ing Law to him&s;elf and others. Where&s;oever &s;uch a man appears, he ought to reign: He bears in his Per&s;on the Divine Character of a Sove|reign: God has rais'd him above all; and &s;uch as will not &s;ubmit to him, ought to be accounted Sons of <HI>Belial,</HI> brought forth and &s;lain. But he dos withal confe&s;s, that if no &s;uch man be found, there is no natural King: All the Prerogatives belonging to him vani&s;h, for want of one who is capable of enjoying them. He lays &s;evere Cen&s;ures upon tho&s;e who not being thus qualified take upon them to govern men, equal to or better than them&s;elves; and judges the a&s;&s;umption of &s;uch Powers by per&s;ons not naturally adapted to the admini&s;tration of them, as barbarous U&s;urpations, which no Law or Rea&s;on can ju&s;tify; and is not &s;o much tran&s;ported with the excellency of this true King, as not to <NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">t. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">t. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE>confe&s;s he ought to be limited by Law: <HI>Qui legem praee&s;&s;e jubet, videtur jubere praee&s;&s;e Deum &amp; Leges: qui autem hominem praee&s;&s;e jubet, adjungit &amp; be&s;tiam; libido quippe talis e&s;t, atque obliquos agit, etiam viros optimos qui &s;unt in pot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tate, ex quo mens atque appetitus Lex e&s;t.</HI> This agrees with the words of the be&s;t King that is known to have bin in the world, pro|ceeding, as is mo&s;t probable, from a &s;en&s;e of the Pa&s;&s;ions that reign'd in his own brea&s;t; <HI>Man being in honour, has no under&s;tanding, but is like to the bea&s;t that peri&s;hes.</HI> This &s;hews that &s;uch as deny that Kings do reign

And as our Author thinks Learning makes men &s;editious, <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> al&s;o acknow|ledges, that tho&s;e who have Under&s;tanding and Courage, which may be taken for Learning, or the effect of it, will never endure the Govern|ment of one or a few that do not excel them in Vertue: but no where di&s;prai&s;es a Popular Government, unle&s;s the Multitude be compos'd of &s;uch as are barbarous, &s;tupid, leud, vicious, and uncapable of the Hap|pine&s;s for which Governments are in&s;tituted; who cannot live to them|&s;elves, but like a herd of Bea&s;ts mu&s;t be brought under the dominion of another; or who, having among them&s;elves &s;uch an excellent Per&s;on as is above de&s;crib'd, will not &s;ubmit to him, but either kill, bani&s;h, or bring him to be equal with others, whom God had made to excel all. I do not trouble my &s;elf, or the Reader, with citing here and there a Line out of his Books, but refer my &s;elf to tho&s;e who have perus'd his Moral and Political Writings, &s;ubmitting to the &s;evere&s;t Cen&s;ures, if this be not the true Sen&s;e of 'em; and that Vertue alone, in his opinion, ought to give the preheminence. And as <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> following the wi&s;e Men of tho&s;e times, &s;hews us how far Rea&s;on, improv'd by Meditation, can advance in the knowledge and love of that which is truly good; &s;o we may in <HI>Filmer</HI> guided by <HI>Heylin,</HI> &s;ee an Example of corrupted Chri&s;tians, who extingui|&s;hing the Light of Religion by their Vices, and degenerating into Bea&s;ts (whil&s;t they endeavour to &s;upport the per&s;onal Intere&s;t of &s;ome men, who are rais'd to Dignitys by the con&s;ent of Nations, or by unwarran|table ways and means) would ca&s;t all the Power into the hands of &s;uch as happen to be born in certain Familys; as if Governments had not bin in&s;tituted for the common good of Nations, but only to increa&s;e their Pride, and foment their Vices; or that the care and direction of a great People were &s;o ea&s;y a work, that every Man, Woman, or Child, how young, weak, fooli&s;h or wicked &s;oever, may be worthy of it, and able to manage it.</P>

<P>OUR Author's judgment, as well as inclinations to Vertue, are ma|nife&s;ted in the preference he gives to the manners of the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians</HI> and other Ea&s;tern Nations, before the <HI>Grecians</HI> and <HI>Romans:</HI> Whereas the fir&s;t were never remarkable for any thing, but Pride, Leudne&s;s, Treachery, Cruelty, Cowardice, Madne&s;s, and hatred to all that is good; whil&s;t the others excel'd in Wi&s;dom, Valour, and all the Vertues that de&s;erve imitation. This was &s;o well ob&s;erv'd by St. <HI>Augu&s;tin,</HI> that <NOTE PLACE="marg">De Civ. Dei.</NOTE>he brings no &s;tronger Argument to prove, that God leaves nothing that is good in man unrewarded, than that he gave the dominion of the be&s;t part of the World to the <HI>Romans,</HI> who in moral Vertues excel'd all other Na|tions. And I think no Example can be alledg'd of a Free People that has ever bin conquer'd by an Ab&s;olute Monarch, unle&s;s he did incomparably &s;urpa&s;s them in Riches and Strength; whereas many great Kings have bin overthrown by &s;mall Republicks: and the &s;ucce&s;s being con&s;tantly the &s;ame, it cannot be attributed to Fortune, but mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the pro|duction of Vertue and good Order. <HI>Machiavel</HI> di&s;cour&s;ing of the&s;e mat|ters, finds Vertue to be &s;o e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to the e&s;tabli&s;hment and pre&s;ervation of Liberty, that he thinks it impo&s;&s;ible for a corrupted Peo|ple to &s;et up a good Government, or for a Tyranny to be introduc'd if they be vertuous; and makes this <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Si puo far que&s;ta conclu&s;ione, che dove la materia non e corrotta, i tumulti ed altri &s;candali non nuocono: l&agrave; dove la e corrotta le buone Leggi non giovano. <BIBL><HI>Machiav.</HI> Di&s;c. &s;opra <HI>T. Livio,</HI> lib. 1.</BIBL></NOTE>Conclu&s;ion, <HI>That where the Matter</HI> (that is, the body of the People) <HI>is not corrupted, Tumults and Di&s;orders do no hurt; and where it is corrupted, good Laws do no good:</HI> Which being confirm'd by Rea&s;on and Experience, I think no wi&s;e man has ever con|tradicted him.</P>
<P>But I do not more wonder that <HI>Filmer</HI> &s;hould look upon Ab&s;olute Mo|narchy to be the Nur&s;e of Vertue, tho we &s;ee they did never &s;ub&s;i&s;t toge|ther, than that he &s;hould attribute Order and Stability to it; whereas Order principally con&s;i&s;ts in appointing to every one his right Place, Of|fice or Work; and he lays the whole weight of the Government upon one Per&s;on, who very often dos neither de&s;erve, nor is able to bear the lea&s;t part of it. <HI>Plato, Ari&s;totle, Hooker,</HI> and (I may &s;ay in &s;hort) all wi&s;e men have held, that Order requir'd that the wi&s;e&s;t, be&s;t, and mo&s;t valiant &s;hould be plac'd in the Offices where Wi&s;dom, Vertue and Va|lour are requi&s;it. If common &s;en&s;e did not teach us this, we might learn it from the Scripture. When God gave the conduct of his People to <HI>Mo&s;es, Jo&s;hua, Samuel,</HI> and others, he endow'd them with all the Ver|tues and Graces requir'd for the right performance of their Duty. When the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> were oppre&s;t by the <HI>Midianites, Phili&s;tins</HI> and <HI>Ammonites,</HI> they expected help from the mo&s;t vi&s;e and valiant. When <HI>Hannibal</HI> was at the Gates of <HI>Rome,</HI> and had fill'd <HI>Italy</HI> with Fire and Blood; or when the <HI>Gauls</HI> overwhelm'd that Country with their multitudes and fury, the Senat and People of <HI>Rome</HI> put them&s;elves under the conduct of <HI>Ca|millus,</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="101">
<HI>Manlius, Fabius, Scipio,</HI> and the like; and when they fail'd to   chu&s;e &s;uch as were fit for the work to be done, they receiv'd &s;uch defeats as convinc'd 'em of their Error. But if our Author &s;ay true, Order re|quir'd that the Power of defending the Country &s;hould have bin annex'd as an Inheritance to one Family, or left to him that could get it, and the exerci&s;e of all Authority committed to the next in Blood, tho the weake&s;t of Women, or the ba&s;e&s;t of Men.</P>
<P>The like may be &s;aid of judging, or doing of Ju&s;tice; and 'tis ab&s;urd to pretend that either is expected from the Power, not the Per&s;on of the Monarch; for experience dos too well &s;hew how much all things halt in relation to Ju&s;tice or Defence, when there is a defect in him that ought to judg us, and to fight our Battels. But of all things this ought lea&s;t to be alledg'd by the Advocats for ab&s;olute Monarchy, who deny that the Authority can be &s;eparated from the Per&s;on, and lay it as a fundamental Principle, that who&s;oever has it may do what he plea&s;es, and be accoun|table to no man.</P>
<P>Our Author's next work is to &s;hew, that Stability is the effect of this good Order; but he ought to have known, that Stability is then only worthy of prai&s;e, when it is in that which is good. No man delights in &s;ickne&s;s or pain, becau&s;e it is long, or incurable; nor in &s;lavery and mi&s;ery, becau&s;e it is perpetual: much le&s;s will any man in his &s;en&s;es com|mend a permanency in vice and wickedne&s;s. He mu&s;t therefore prove, that the Stability he boa&s;ts of is in things that are good, or all that he &s;ays of it &s;ignifies nothing.</P>
<P>I might leave him here with as little fear, that any man who &s;hall e|&s;pou&s;e his Quarrel, will ever be able to remove this Ob&s;tacle, as that he him&s;elf &s;hould ri&s;e out of his Grave and do it. But I hope to prove, that of all things under the Sun, there is none more mutable or un&s;table than ab&s;olute Monarchy; which is all that I di&s;pute again&s;t, profe&s;&s;ing much veneration for that which is mix'd, regulated by Law, and directed to the Publick Good.</P>
<P>This might be prov'd by many Arguments, but I &s;hall confine my &s;elf to two; the one drawn from Rea&s;on, the other from matters of Fact.</P>
<P>Nothing can be call'd &s;table, that is not &s;o in Principle and Practice, in which re&s;pect human Nature is not well capable of Stability; but the ut|mo&s;t deviation from it that can be imagin'd, is, when &s;uch an Error is laid for a Foundation as can never be corrected. All will confe&s;s, that if there be any &s;tability in man, it mu&s;t be in Wi&s;dom and Vertue, and in tho&s;e Actions that are thereby directed; for in weakne&s;s, folly and mad|ne&s;s, there can be none. The Stability therefore that we &s;eek, in rela|tion to the exerci&s;e of Civil and Military Powers, can never be found, unle&s;s care be taken that &s;uch as exerci&s;e tho&s;e Powers, be endow'd with the Qualitys that &s;hould make them &s;table. This is utterly repugnant to our Author's Doctrin: He lays for a Foundation, That the Succe&s;&s;ion goes to the next in Blood, without di&s;tinction of Age, Sex, or per&s;onal Qualitys; whereas even he him&s;elf could not have the impudence to &s;ay, that Children, and Women (where they are admitted) or Fools, Mad|men, and &s;uch as are full of all wickedne&s;s, do not come to be the Heirs of reigning Familys, as well as of the meane&s;t. The Stability therefore that can be expected from &s;uch a Government, either depends upon tho&s;e who have none in them&s;elves, or is refer'd wholly to Chance, which is directly oppo&s;ite to Stability.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="102">
  This would be the ca&s;e, tho it were (as we &s;ay) an even Wager, whether the Per&s;on would be fit or unfit, and that there were as many men in the world able, as unable to perform the Duty of a King; but Experience &s;hewing that among many millions of men, there is hardly one that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the Qualitys requir'd in a King, 'tis &s;o many to one, that he upon whom the Lot &s;hall fall, will not be the man we &s;eek, in who&s;e Per&s;on and Government there can be &s;uch a &s;tability as is a&s;&s;erted. And that failing, all mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily fail; for there can be no &s;tability in his Will, Laws or Actions, who has none in his Per&s;on.</P>
<P>That we may &s;ee whether this be verify'd by Experience, we need not &s;earch into the dark relations of the <HI>Babylonian</HI> and <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI> Monarchys: Tho&s;e rude Ages afford us little in&s;truction; and tho the fragments of Hi&s;tory remaining do &s;ufficiently &s;how, that all things there were in per|petual fluctuation, by rea&s;on of the madne&s;s of their Kings, and the vio|lence of tho&s;e who tran&s;ported the Empire from one Place or Family to another, I will not much rely upon them, but &s;lightly touching &s;ome of their Storys, pa&s;s to tho&s;e that are better known to us.</P>
<P>The Kings of tho&s;e Ages &s;eem to have liv'd rather like Bea&s;ts in a Fo|re&s;t, than Men join'd in Civil Society: they follow'd the Example of <HI>Nimrod</HI> the mighty Hunter; Force was the only Law that prevail'd, the &s;tronger devour'd the weaker, and continu'd in Power till ejected by one of more &s;trength or better fortune. By this means the race of <HI>Ninus</HI> was de&s;troy'd by <HI>Belochus: Arbaces</HI> rent the Kingdom a&s;under, and took <HI>Media</HI> to him&s;elf: <HI>Morodach</HI> extingui&s;h'd the Race of <HI>Belochus,</HI> and was made King: <HI>Nabuchodono&s;or</HI> like a Flood overwhelm'd all for a time, de&s;troy'd the Kingdoms of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> and <HI>Egypt,</HI> with many others, and found no ob&s;tacle, till his rage and pride turn'd to a mo&s;t be&s;tial madne&s;s: And the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI> Empire was wholly aboli&s;h'd at the death of his Grand|child <HI>Bel&s;hazzar;</HI> and no Stability can be found in the reigns of tho&s;e great Kings, unle&s;s that name be given to the Pride, Idolatry, Cruelty, and Wickedne&s;s in which they remain'd con&s;tant. If we examin matters more di&s;tinctly, we &s;hall find that all things vari'd according to the hu|mour of the Prince. Whil&s;t <HI>Pharaoh</HI> liv'd, who had receiv'd many &s;ig|nal Services from <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> were well us'd: but when another ro&s;e up who knew him not, they were per&s;ecuted with all the extremitys of Inju&s;tice and Cruelty, till the furious King per&s;i&s;ting in his de&s;ign of exterminating them, brought de&s;truction upon him&s;elf and the Nation. Where the like Power has prevail'd, it has ever produc'd the like effects. When &s;ome great men of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> had per&s;uaded <HI>Darius,</HI> that it was a fine thing to command that no man for the &s;pace of thirty days &s;hould make any Petition to God or Man, but to the King only, <HI>Daniel</HI> the mo&s;t wi&s;e and holy Man then in the world mu&s;t be thrown to the Lions. When God <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>had miraculou&s;ly &s;av'd him, the &s;ame Sentence was pa&s;s'd again&s;t the Princes of the Nation. When <HI>Haman</HI> had fill'd <HI>Aha&s;uerus</HI> his ears with Lies, all the <HI>Jews</HI> were appointed to be &s;lain; and when the fraud of that Villain was detected, leave was given them, with the like precipitancy, to kill whom they pleas'd. When the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> came to have Kings, they were &s;ubject to the &s;ame Storms, and always with their Blood &s;uffer'd the Penalty of their Princes madne&s;s. When one kind of Fury po&s;&s;e&s;t <HI>Saul,</HI> he &s;lew the Prie&s;ts, per&s;ecuted <HI>David,</HI> and would have kill'd his brave Son <HI>Jonathan:</HI> When he fell under another, he took upon him to do the Prie&s;t's Office, pretended to under&s;tand the Word of God better than <HI>Samuel,</HI> and &s;par'd tho&s;e that God had commanded him to de&s;troy:
<PB N="95" REF="103">
Upon another whim&s;y he kill'd the <HI>Gibeonites,</HI> and never re&s;ted from   finding new Inventions to vex the People, till he had brought many thou|&s;ands of them to peri&s;h with him&s;elf and his Sons on Mount <HI>Gilboa.</HI> We do not find any King, in Wi&s;dom, Valour and Holine&s;s, equal to <HI>Da|vid;</HI> and yet he falling under the temptations that attend the greate&s;t Fortunes, brought Civil Wars and a Plague upon the Nation. When <HI>Solomon</HI>'s heart was drawn away by &s;trange Women, he fill'd the Land with Idols, and oppre&s;t the People with intolerable Tributes. <HI>Rehobo|am</HI>'s Folly made that Rent in the Kingdom which could never be made up. Under his Succe&s;&s;ors the people &s;erv'd God, <HI>Baal</HI> or <HI>A&s;htaroth,</HI> as be&s;t pleas'd him who had the Power; and no other marks of Stability can be alledg'd to have bin in that Kingdom, than the con&s;tancy of their Kings in the practice of Idolatry, their cruelty to the Prophets, hatred to the <HI>Jews,</HI> and civil Wars producing &s;uch Slaughters as are reported in few other Storys: The Kingdom was in the &s;pace of about two hundred years po&s;&s;e&s;t by nine &s;everal Familys, not one of 'em getting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion otherwi&s;e than by the &s;laughter of his Predece&s;&s;or, and the extinction of his Race; and ended in the Bondage of the ten Tribes, which continues to this day.</P>
<P>He that de&s;ires farther proofs of this Point, may &s;eek 'em in the Hi&s;to|rys of <HI>Alexander</HI> of <HI>Macedon,</HI> and his Succe&s;&s;ors: He &s;eems to have bin endow'd with all the Vertues that Nature improv'd by Di&s;ciplin did ever attain, &s;o that he is believ'd to be the man meant by <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> who on account of the excellency of his Vertues was by Nature fram'd for a King; and <HI>Plutarch</HI> a&s;cribes his Conque&s;ts rather to tho&s;e, than to his Fortune. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. in Vic. Alex.</NOTE>But even that Vertue was overthrown by the Succe&s;&s;es that accompanied it: He burnt the mo&s;t magnificent Palace of the world in a frolick, to plea&s;e a mad drunken Whore: Upon the mo&s;t frivolous &s;ugge&s;tions of Eunuchs and Ra&s;cals, he kill'd the be&s;t and brave&s;t of his Friends; and his Valour, which had no equal, not &s;ub&s;i&s;ting without his other Ver|tues, peri&s;h'd when he became leud, proud, cruel and &s;uper&s;titious; &s;o as it may be truly &s;aid, he died a Coward. His Succe&s;&s;ors did not differ from him: When they had kill'd his Mother, Wife and Children, they exercis'd their fury again&s;t one another; and tearing the Kingdom to pieces, the Survivors left the Sword as an Inheritance to their Familys, who peri&s;h'd by it, or under the weight of the <HI>Roman</HI> Chains.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Romans</HI> had lo&s;t that Liberty which had bin the Nur&s;e of their Vertue, and gain'd the Empire in lieu of it, they attain'd to our Author's applauded Stability. <HI>Julius</HI> being &s;lain in the Senat, the fir&s;t Que&s;tion was, whether it could be re&s;tor'd, or not? And that being de|cided by the Battel of <HI>Philippi,</HI> the Conquerors &s;et them&s;elves to de&s;troy all the eminent men in the City, as the be&s;t means to e&s;tabli&s;h the Mo|narchy. <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> gain'd it by the death of <HI>Antonius,</HI> and the corruption of the Soldiers; and he dying naturally, or by the fraud of his Wife, the Empire was transfer'd to her Son <HI>Tiberius;</HI> under whom the mi|&s;erable People &s;uffer'd the wor&s;t effects of the mo&s;t impure Lu&s;t and inhuman Cruelty: He being &s;tifled the Government went on with much uniformity and &s;tability; <HI>Caligula, Claudius, Nero, Galba, Otho, Vitellius</HI> regularly and con&s;tantly did all the mi&s;chief they could, and were not more like to each other in the Villanys they committed, than in the Deaths they &s;uffer'd. <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI>'s more gentle Reign did no way com|pen&s;ate the Blood he &s;pilt to attain the Empire: And the Benefits receiv'd from <HI>Titus</HI> his &s;hort liv'd Vertue, were infinitly overbalanc'd by the de|te&s;table
<PB N="96" REF="104">
  Vices of his Brother <HI>Domitian,</HI> who turn'd all things into the old Channel of Cruelty, Lu&s;t, Rapine and Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s. His &s;laugh|ter gave a little breath to the ga&s;ping peri&s;hing World; and men might be vertuous under the Government of <HI>Nerva, Trajan, Antoninus, Aure|lius,</HI> and a few more; tho even in their time Religion was always dange|rous. But when the Power fell into the hands of <HI>Commodus, Heliogaba|lus, Caracalla,</HI> and others of that &s;ort, nothing was &s;afe but ob&s;curity, or the utmo&s;t exce&s;&s;es of leudne&s;s and ba&s;ene&s;s. However, whil&s;t the Will of the Governor pa&s;s'd for a Law, and the Power did u&s;ually fall into the hands of &s;uch as were mo&s;t bold and violent, the utmo&s;t &s;ecurity that any man could have for his Per&s;on or E&s;tate, depended upon his temper; and Princes them&s;elves, whether good or bad, had no longer Lea&s;es of their lives, than the furious and corrupted Soldiers would give them; and the Empire of the World was changeable, according to the Succe&s;s of a Battel.</P>
<P>Matters were not much mended when the Emperors became Chri&s;ti|ans: Some favour'd tho&s;e who were call'd <HI>Orthodox,</HI> and gave great Re|venues to corrupt the Clergy. Others &s;upported <HI>Ariani&s;m,</HI> and per&s;ecu|ted the Orthodox with as much a&s;perity as the Pagans had done. Some revolted, and &s;hew'd them&s;elves more fierce again&s;t the profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity, than they that had never had any knowledg of it. The World was torn in pieces among&s;t them, and often &s;uffer'd as great mi&s;e|rys by their &s;loth, ignorance and co wardice, as by their fury and mad|ne&s;s, till the Empire was totally di&s;&s;olv'd and lo&s;t. That which under the weakne&s;s and irregularity of a popular Government, had conquer'd all from the <HI>Euphrates</HI> to <HI>Britain,</HI> and de&s;troy'd the Kingdoms of <HI>A&s;ia, E|gypt, Macedon, Numidia,</HI> and a multitude of others, was made a Prey to unknown barbarous Nations, and rent into as many pieces as it had bin compos'd of, when it enjoy'd the Stability that accompanys Divine and Ab&s;olute Monarchy.</P>
<P>The like may be &s;aid of all the Kingdoms in the World: they may have their ebbings and flowings according to the Vertues or Vices of Prin|ces or their Favorites; but can never have any Stability, becau&s;e there is, and can be none in them. Or if any Exception may be brought again&s;t this Rule, it mu&s;t be of tho&s;e Monarchys only which are mix'd and regu|lated by Laws, where Diets, Parliaments, A&s;&s;emblys of E&s;tates, or Se|nats, may &s;upply the defects of a Prince, re&s;train him if he prove extra|vagant, and reject &s;uch as are found to be unworthy of their Office, which are as odious to our Author and his Followers, as the mo&s;t popular Go|vernments, and can be of no advantage to his Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>There is another ground of perpetual Fluctuation in Ab&s;olute Monar|chys; or &s;uch as are grown &s;o &s;trong, that they cannot be re&s;train'd by Law, tho according to their In&s;titution they ought to be, di&s;tinct from, but in &s;ome mea&s;ure relating to the Inclinations of the Monarch, that is, the impul&s;e of Mini&s;ters, Favorites, Wives or Whores, who frequently govern all things according to their own Pa&s;&s;ions or Intere&s;ts. And tho we cannot &s;ay who were the Favorites of every one of the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI> or <HI>Egyptian</HI> Kings, yet the Examples before-mention'd of the different me|thod follow'd in <HI>Egypt</HI> before and after the death of <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> and in <HI>Per&s;is</HI> whil&s;t the idolatrous Princes, and <HI>Haman,</HI> or <HI>Daniel, E&s;ther</HI> and <HI>Mor|decai</HI> were in credit; the violent Changes happening thereupon, give us rea&s;on to believe the like were in the times of other Kings: and if we ex|amin the Hi&s;torys of latter Ages, and the Lives of Princes that are more
<PB N="97" REF="105">
exactly known, we &s;hall find that Kingdoms are more frequently &s;way'd   by tho&s;e who have Power with the Prince, than by his own Judgment: So that who&s;oever has to deal with Princes concerning Foreign or Dome|&s;tick Affairs, is oblig'd more to regard the humour of tho&s;e Per&s;ons, than the mo&s;t important Intere&s;ts of a Prince or People.</P>
<P>I might draw too much envy upon my &s;elf, if I &s;hould take upon me to cite all the Examples of this kind that are found in modern Hi&s;torys, or the Memoirs that do more preci&s;ely &s;hew the Temper of Princes, and the &s;ecret Springs by which they were mov'd. But as tho&s;e who have well ob&s;erv'd the management of Affairs in <HI>France</HI> during the Reigns of <HI>Francis</HI> the Fir&s;t, <HI>Henry</HI> the Second, <HI>Francis</HI> the Second, <HI>Charles</HI> the Ninth, <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, and <HI>Lewis</HI> the Thirteenth, will confe&s;s, that the Intere&s;ts of the Dukes of <HI>Montmorency</HI> and <HI>Gui&s;e,</HI> Queen <HI>Katherine de Medicis,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Epernon, La <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;&s;eu&s;e, Madame de Guiche, de Gabriele, d' Entragues,</HI> the <HI>Marechal d' Ancre,</HI> the Con&s;table <HI>de Luines,</HI> and the Cardinal <HI>de Richelieu,</HI> were more to be con&s;ider'd by tho&s;e who had any publick or private Bu&s;ine&s;s to treat at Court, than the Opinions of tho&s;e Princes, or the mo&s;t weighty Concernments of the State; &s;o it cannot be denied, that other Kingdoms where Princes legally have, or wrongfully u&s;urp the like Power, are govern'd in the like manner; or if it be, there is hardly any Prince's Reign that will not furni&s;h abun|dant proof of what I have a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P>I agree with our Author, that <HI>good Order and Stability produce Strength.</HI> If Monarchy therefore excel in them, Ab&s;olute Monarchys &s;hould be of more &s;trength than tho&s;e that are limited, according to the proportion of their Riches, extent of Territory, and number of People that they go|vern; and tho&s;e limited Monarchys in the like proportion more &s;trong than popular Governments or Commonwealths. If this be &s;o, I wonder how a few of <HI>tho&s;e giddy Greeks who,</HI> according to our Author, <HI>had learn|ing enough only to make them &s;editious,</HI> came to overthrow the va&s;t Armys of the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> as often as they met with 'em; and &s;eldom found any other difficulty than what aro&s;e from their own Countrymen, who &s;ometimes &s;ided with the Barbarians. Seditions are often rais'd by a little prating; but when one Man was to fight again&s;t fifty, or a hundred, as at the Bat|tels of <HI>Salamis, Platea, Marathon,</HI> and others, then Indu&s;try, Wi&s;dom, Skill and Valour were requir'd; and if their Learning had not made 'em to excel in tho&s;e Vertues, they mu&s;t have bin overwhelm'd by the prodi|gious multitudes of their Enemys. This was &s;o well known to the <HI>Per&s;i|ans,</HI> that when <HI>Cyrus</HI> the younger prepar'd to invade his Brother <HI>Artax|erxes,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. vit. Artax.</NOTE>he brought together indeed a va&s;t Army of <HI>A&s;iaticks;</HI> but chiefly re|lied upon the Coun&s;el and Valour of ten thou&s;and <HI>Grecians,</HI> whom he had engag'd to &s;erve him. The&s;e giddy heads, accompanied with good hands, in the great Battel near <HI>Babylon,</HI> found no re&s;i&s;tance from <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> his Army; and when <HI>Cyrus</HI> was kill'd by accident in the pur&s;uit of the Vic|tory they had gain'd, and their own Officers treacherou&s;ly murder'd, they made good their retreat into <HI>Greece</HI> under the conduct of <HI>Xenophon,</HI> in de|&s;pite of above four hundred thou&s;and Hor&s;e and Foot, who endeavour'd to oppo&s;e them. They were de&s;titute of Hor&s;e, Mony, Provi&s;ions, Friends and all other help, except what their Wi&s;dom and Valour fur|ni&s;h'd them; and thereupon relying, they pa&s;s'd over the Bellys of all the Enemys that ventur'd to appear again&s;t them in a march of a thou&s;and miles.

<P>It may in like manner appear &s;trange, that <HI>Alexander</HI> with the Forces of <HI>Greece,</HI> much dimini&s;h'd by the <HI>Phocean, Peloponne&s;ian, Theban,</HI> and other inte&s;tin Wars, could overthrow all the Powers of the Ea&s;t, and conquer more Provinces than any other Army ever &s;aw; if &s;o much order and &s;tability were to be found in ab&s;olute Monarchys, and if the Liberty in which the <HI>Grecians</HI> were educated did only fit them for Sedi|tions: And it would &s;eem no le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hing, that <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Greece,</HI> whil&s;t they were free, &s;hould furni&s;h &s;uch numbers of men excelling in all moral Vertues, to the admiration of all &s;ucceeding Ages; and thereby become &s;o powerful that no Monarchs were able to re&s;i&s;t them; and that the &s;ame Countrys &s;ince the lo&s;s of their Liberty, have always bin weak, ba&s;e, cowardly and vicious, if the &s;ame Liberty had not bin the Mother and Nur&s;e of their Vertue, as well as the root of their Power.</P>
<P>It cannot be &s;aid that <HI>Alexander</HI> was a Monarch in our Author's &s;en&s;e; for the power of the <HI>Macedonian</HI> Kings was &s;mall. <HI>Philip</HI> confe&s;t the People were Freemen, and his Son found them to be &s;o, when his For|tune had overthrown his Vertue, and he fell to hate and fear that genero|&s;ity of Spirit which it creates. He made his Conque&s;ts by it, and lov'd it as long as he de&s;erv'd to be lov'd. His Succe&s;&s;ors had the &s;ame fortune: When their Hearts came to be fill'd with Barbarick Pride, and to delight only in rendring men Slaves, they became weak and ba&s;e, and were ea&s;ily overthrown by the <HI>Romans,</HI> who&s;e Vertue and Fortune did al&s;o peri&s;h with their Liberty. All the Nations they had to deal with, had the &s;ame fate. They never conquer'd a Free People without extreme difficulty: They receiv'd many great defeats, and were often nece&s;&s;itated to fight for their Lives again&s;t the <HI>Latins, Sabins, Tu&s;cans, Samnites, Carthaginians, Spaniards;</HI> and in the height of their Power found it a hard work to &s;ubdue a few poor <HI>Etolians:</HI> But the greate&s;t Kings were ea&s;ily overcome. When <HI>Antiochus</HI> had in&s;olently boa&s;ted that he would <NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. in vit. Q. Flamin.</NOTE>cover <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> with the multitude of his Troops, <HI>Quintius Flami|nius</HI> ingeniou&s;ly compar'd his Army of <HI>Per&s;ians, Chaldeans, Syrians, Me&s;opotamians, Cappadocians, Arabians,</HI> and other ba&s;e <HI>A&s;tatic</HI> Slaves, to a Supper &s;et before him by a Grecian Freind, which &s;eeming to be of &s;eve|ral &s;orts of Veni&s;on, was all cut out of one Hog, variou&s;ly dre&s;s'd; and not long after, that va&s;t multitude was as ea&s;ily &s;laughter'd as the Hog had bin. The greate&s;t danger of the War with <HI>Mithridates</HI> was to avoid his Poi|&s;ons and Treacherys; and to follow him thro the De&s;erts where he fled. When <HI>Lucullus</HI> with le&s;s than twenty thou&s;and men had put <HI>Tigranes</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. in vit.

If this be not enough to prove the Fal&s;hood of our Au|thor's Propo&s;ition, I de&s;ire it may be con&s;ider'd whether good Order or Stability be wanting in <HI>Venice:</HI> Whether <HI>Tu&s;cany,</HI> be in a better condition to defend it &s;elf &s;ince it fell under the power of the <HI>Medices,</HI> or when it was full of free Citys: Whether it were an ea&s;y work to conquer <HI>Swit|zerland:</HI> Whether the <HI>Hollanders</HI> are of greater &s;trength &s;ince the recovery

<HEAD>SECT. XII. The Glory, Vertue, and Power of the <HI>Romans</HI> began and ended with their Liberty.</HEAD>
<P>AMong many fine things propos'd by our Author, I &s;ee none more to be admir'd, or that better declares the &s;oundne&s;s of his Judgment, than that he is only pleas'd with the beginning and end of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire; and &s;ays, <HI>that their time of Liberty</HI> (between tho&s;e two ex|tremes) <HI>had nothing of good in it, but that it was of &s;hort continuance.</HI> Whereas I dare affirm that all that was ever de&s;irable, or worthy of prai&s;e and imitation in <HI>Rome,</HI> proceeded from its Liberty, and grew up and pe|ri&s;h'd with it: which I think will not be contradicted by any, but tho&s;e who prefer the mo&s;t &s;ordid Vices before the mo&s;t eminent Vertues; who believe the People to have bin more worthily employ'd by the <HI>Tarquins</HI> in clean&s;ing Jakes and common Shores, than in acquiring the Dominion of the be&s;t part of Mankind; and account it better for a People to be op|pre&s;t with hard labour under a proud Ma&s;ter, in a &s;teril, unhealthy ten|mile Territory, than to command all the Countrys that lie between the <HI>Fuphrates</HI> and <HI>Britain.</HI> Such Opinions will hardly find any better Patrons than <HI>Filmer</HI> and his Di&s;ciples, nor the matters of fact, as they are repre|&s;ented, be denied by any that know the Hi&s;torys of tho&s;e times. Many <HI>Romans</HI> may have had &s;eeds of vertue in them, whil&s;t in the in&s;ancy of that City they liv'd under Kings; but they brought forth little fruit. <HI>Tarquin,</HI> &s;irnam'd the Proud, being a <HI>Grecian</HI> by extraction, had perhaps ob&s;erv'd that the Vertue of that Nation had render'd them aver&s;e to the Divine Government he de&s;ir'd to &s;et up; and having by his well|natur'd <HI>Tullia</HI> poi&s;on'd his own Brother her Husband, and his own Wife her Si&s;ter, married her, kill'd her Father, and &s;par'd none that he thought able to oppo&s;e his de&s;igns, to fini&s;h the work, he butcher'd the Senat, with &s;uch as &s;eem'd mo&s;t eminent among the People, and like a mo&s;t pious Father endeavour'd to render the City de&s;olate: during that time they who would not be made in&s;truments of tho&s;e Villanys, were oblig'd for their own &s;afety to conceal their Vertues; but he being re|mov'd, they &s;hin'd in their Glory. Whil&s;t he reign'd, <HI>Brutus, Vale|rius, Horatius, Herminius, Larcius,</HI> and <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> lay hid and unre|garded; but when they came to fight for them&s;elves, and to imploy their Valour for the good of their Country, they gave &s;uch te&s;timonys of Bra|very as have bin admir'd by all &s;ucceeding ages, and &s;ettled &s;uch a Di&s;ci|plin, as produc'd others like to them, or more excellent than they, as long as their Liberty la&s;ted. In two hundred and &s;ixty years that they re|main'd under the Government of Kings, tho all of 'em, the la&s;t only ex|cepted, were cho&s;en by the Senat and People, and did as much to advance
<PB N="100" REF="108">
  the publick Service as could rea&s;onably be expected from them, their Do|minion hardly extended &s;o far as from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Hown&s;low:</HI> But in little more than three hundred years after they recover'd their Liberty, they had &s;ubdu'd all the warlike Nations of <HI>Italy,</HI> de&s;troy'd va&s;t Armys of the <HI>Gauls, Cimbri,</HI> and <HI>Germans,</HI> overthrown the formidable power of <HI>Car|thage,</HI> conquer'd the Ci&s;alpine and Tran&s;alpine <HI>Gauls,</HI> with all the Nati|ons of <HI>Spain,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the ferocity of the one, and the more con|&s;tant valour of the other, with the prodigious multitudes of both: They had brought all <HI>Greece</HI> into &s;ubjection, and by the conque&s;t of <HI>Macedon</HI> the Spoils of the World to adorn their City; and found &s;o little difficulty in all the Wars that happen'd between them and the greate&s;t Kings after the Death of <HI>Alexander</HI> of <HI>Epirus</HI> and <HI>Pirrhus,</HI> that the defeats of <HI>Siphax, Per&s;es, Antiochus, Pru&s;ias, Tigranes, Ptolomy,</HI> and many others, did hardly de&s;erve to be number'd among&s;t their Victorys.</P>
<P>It were ridiculous to impute this to chance, or to think that Fortune, which of all things is the mo&s;t variable, could for &s;o many Ages continue the &s;ame cour&s;e, unle&s;s &s;upported by Vertue; or to &s;uppo&s;e that all the&s;e Monarchys which are &s;o much extol'd, could have bin de&s;troy'd by that Commonwealth, if it had wanted Strength, Stability, Vertue, or good Order. The &s;ecret Coun&s;els of God are impenetrable; but the ways by which he accompli&s;hes his de&s;igns are often evident: When he intends to exalt a People, he fills both them and their Leaders with the Vertues &s;uta|ble to the accompli&s;hment of his end; and takes away all Wi&s;dom and Vertue from tho&s;e he re&s;olves to de&s;troy. The Pride of the <HI>Babylonians</HI> and <HI>A&s;&s;yrians</HI> fell thro the ba&s;ene&s;s of <HI>Sardanapalus;</HI> and the great City was taken while <HI>Bel&s;hazzar</HI> lay drunk among&s;t his Whores: The Em|pire was tran&s;ported to the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Grecians</HI> by the valour of <HI>Cyrus, Alexander,</HI> and the brave Armys that follow'd them. Hi&s;torys furni&s;h us with innumerable examples of this kind: But I think none can be found of a cowardly, weak, effeminate, fooli&s;h, ill-di&s;ciplin'd People, that have ever &s;ubdu'd &s;uch as were eminent in Strength, Wi&s;dom, Valor, and good Di&s;ciplin; or that the&s;e qualitys have bin found or &s;ub&s;i&s;ted any where, unle&s;s cultivated and nouri&s;h'd by a well-order'd Govern|ment. If this therefore was found among the <HI>Romans,</HI> and not in the Kingdoms they overthrew, they had the order and &s;tability which the Monarchys had not; and the Strength and Vertue by which they ob|tain'd &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, was the product of them. But if this Vertue and the glorious effects of it did begin with Liberty, it al&s;o expir'd with the &s;ame. The be&s;t men that had not fallen in Battel were glean'd up by the Pro&s;criptions, or circumvented for the mo&s;t part by fal&s;e and frivo|lous Accu&s;ations. Mankind is inclin'd to Vice, and the way to Vertue is &s;o hard, that it wants encouragement; but when all Honours, Advanta|ges and Preferments are given to Vice, and de&s;pis'd Vertue finds no other reward than Hatred, Per&s;ecution, and Death, there are few who will follow it. <HI>Tacitus</HI> well de&s;cribes the State of the Empire, when the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> Tacit. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words"></NOTE>Power was ab&s;olutely fallen into the hands of one: <HI>Italia novis cladibus, vel po&s;t longam &s;eculorum &s;eriem repetitis, afflicta; Vrbs incendiis va&s;tata, con&s;umptis antiqui&s;&s;imis delubris, ip&s;o Capitolio Civium manibus incen&s;o; pol|lutae ceremoniae; magna adulteria; plenum exiliis mare; infecti caedibus &s;co|puli; atrocius in urbe &s;aevitum; Nobilitas, opes, omi&s;&s;i vel ge&s;ti honores pro crimine, &amp; ob virtutes certi&s;&s;imum exitium.</HI> His following words &s;hew, that the rewards of the&s;e abominations were not le&s;s odious than the things them&s;elves: The highe&s;t Dignitys were be&s;tow'd upon the <HI>Dela|tores,</HI>

The fir&s;t fruit was &s;uch an intire degeneracy from all good, that <HI>Rome</HI> may be ju&s;tly &s;aid never to have produc'd a brave Man &s;ince the fir&s;t age of her Slavery. <HI>Germanicus</HI> and <HI>Corbulo</HI> were born <HI>expirante Libertate;</HI> and the recompence they receiv'd did &s;o little encourage others to follow their example, that none have bin found in any degree like to them; and tho&s;e of the mo&s;t noble Familys applied them&s;elves to &s;leep, lazine&s;s, and luxury, that they might not be &s;u&s;pected to be better than their Ma&s;ters. <HI>Thra&s;eas, Soranus,</HI> and <HI>Helvidius</HI> were worthy men, who re&s;olv'd to per&s;i&s;t in their Integrity, tho they &s;hould die for it; but that was the only thing that made them eminent; for they were of unknown Familys, not <HI>Romans</HI> by birth, nor ever employ'd in War: And tho&s;e Emperors who did arrive to any degree of Vertue, were <HI>Spaniards, Gauls, Africans, Thracians,</HI> and of all Nations, except <HI>Romans.</HI> The Patrician and Plebeian Familys, which for many ages had fill'd the World with great Commanders, and &s;uch as excel'd in all Vertues, being thus extin|gui&s;h'd or corrupted, the common People fell into the lowe&s;t degree of ba&s;ene&s;s: <HI>Plebs &s;ordida Circo &amp; Theatris &s;ueta.</HI> That People which in <NOTE PLACE="marg">C.

Whether their Emperors were good or bad, they u&s;ually rejoic'd at their Death, in hopes of getting a little Mony or Victuals from the Succe&s;&s;or. Tho the Empire was by this means grown weak and bloodle&s;s, yet it could not fall on a &s;udden: So va&s;t a Body could not die in a moment: All the neighbouring Nations had bin &s;o much broken by their Power, that none was able to take ad|vantage of their Weakne&s;s; and life was pre&s;erv'd by the &s;trength of hungry Barbarians, allur'd by the greatne&s;s of the Pay they receiv'd to defend tho&s;e, who had no power left to defend them&s;elves. This preca|rious and accidental help could not be durable. They who for a while had bin contented with their Wages, &s;oon began to think it fit for them rather to fight for them&s;elves, than for their weak Ma&s;ters; and there|upon fell to &s;et up Emperors depending on them&s;elves, or to &s;eize upon the naked Provinces, where they found no other difficulty than to con|tend with other Strangers, who might have the like de&s;ign upon the &s;ame.

They had nothing left but Riches gather'd out of their va&s;t Dominions; and they learn'd by their ruin, that an Em|pire acquir'd by Vertue could not long be &s;upported by Mony. They who by their Valour had arriv'd at &s;uch a height of Glory, Power, Greatne&s;s, and Happine&s;s, that was never equal'd, and who in all ap|pearance had nothing to fear from any foreign Power, could never have fallen, unle&s;s their Vertue and Di&s;ciplin had decay'd, and the corruption of their Manners excited 'em to turn their victorious Swords into their own bowels.

There was no Vertue in the <HI>Junii, Horatii, Cornelii, Quintii, Decii, Manlii;</HI> but the generous and tender-hearted Princes before-mention'd were perfect examples of it: Whil&s;t annual Magi&s;trats govern'd, there was no &s;tability; <HI>Sejanus, Ma|cro</HI> and <HI>Tigellinus</HI> introduc'd good order: Vertue was not e&s;teem'd by the antient Senat and People; <HI>Me&s;&s;alina, Agrippina, Poppaea, Narci&s;&s;us, Pallas, Vinnius,</HI> and <HI>Laco</HI> knew how to put a ju&s;t value upon it: The irregularitys of popular A&s;&s;emblys, and want of Prudence in the Senat, was repair'd by the temperate proceedings of the <HI>German, Pannonian</HI> and Ea&s;tern Armys&punc; or the mode&s;t di&s;cretion of the Pretorian Bands: The City was deliver'd by them from the burden of governing the World, and for its own good frequently plunder'd, fir'd; and at la&s;t, with the re&s;t of de&s;olated <HI>Italy,</HI> and the noble&s;t Provinces of <HI>Europe, A&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> brought under the yoke of the mo&s;t barbarous and cruel Na|tions.

<HEAD>SECT. XIII. There is di&s;order or prejudice in changing the name or number of Magi&s;trats, whil&s;t the root and principle of their Power continues intire.</HEAD>
<P>IN the next place our Author would per&s;uade us that the <HI>Romans</HI> were incon&s;tant, becau&s;e of their changes from annual Con&s;uls to Military Tribunes, <HI>Decemviri,</HI> and Dictators; and gives the name of Sedition to the complaints made again&s;t U&s;ury, or the conte&s;ts concerning Marriages or Magi&s;tracy: But I affirm,</P>
<P>1. That no change of Magi&s;tracy, as to the name, number, or form, dos te&s;tify irregularity, or bring any manner of prejudice, as long as it is done by tho&s;e who have a right of doing it, and he or they who are created continue within the power of the Law to accompli&s;h the end of their in&s;titution; many forms being in them&s;elves equally good, and may be us'd as well one as another, according to times and other circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>2. In the &s;econd place, 'tis a rare thing for a City at the fir&s;t to be rightly con&s;tituted: Men can hardly at once fore&s;ee all that may happen in many Ages, and the changes that accompany them ought to be pro|vided for. <HI>Rome</HI> in its foundation was &s;ubject to the&s;e defects, and the inconveniences ari&s;ing from them were by degrees di&s;cover'd and reme|di'd. They did not think of regulating U&s;ury, till they &s;aw the mi&s;|chiefs proceeding from the cruelty of U&s;urers; or of &s;etting limits to the proportion of Land that one man might enjoy, till the avarice of a few had &s;o far &s;ucceeded, that their Riches were grown formidable, and ma|ny by the poverty to which they were reduc'd became u&s;ele&s;s to the City. It was not time to make a Law that the Plebeians might marry with the Patricians, till the di&s;tinction had rais'd the Patricians to &s;uch Pride, as to look upon them&s;elves to have &s;omething of divine, and the others to be <HI>Inau&s;picati,</HI> or profane, and brought the City into danger by that divi|&s;ion; nor to make the Plebeians capable of being elected to the chief Magi&s;tracys, till they had men able to perform the dutys of them. But the&s;e things being ob&s;erv'd, remedys were &s;ea&s;onably apply'd without any blood&s;hed or mi&s;chief, tho not without noi&s;e and wrangling.</P>
<P>3. All human Con&s;titutions are &s;ubject to corruption, and mu&s;t peri&s;h, unle&s;s timely renew'd and reduc'd to their fir&s;t principles: This was chief|ly done by means of tho&s;e Tumults which our Author ignorantly blames: The whole People by whom the Magi&s;tracy had bin at fir&s;t created, exe|cuted their power in tho&s;e things which comprehend Sovereignty in the highe&s;t degree, and brought every one to acknowledg it: There was no|thing that they could not do, who fir&s;t confer'd the &s;upreme Honours up|on the Patricians, and then made the Plebeians equal to them. Yet their Mode&s;ty was not le&s;s than their Power or Courage: and therefore when by the Law they might have made a Plebeian Con&s;ul, they did not chu&s;e one in forty years; and when they did make u&s;e of their Right in ad|vancing men of their own Order, they were &s;o prudent, that they can|not

  be &s;aid to have bin mi&s;taken in their Elections three times, whil&s;t their Votes were free: whereas, of all the Emperors that came in by U&s;urpation, pretence of Blood from tho&s;e who had u&s;urp'd, or that were &s;et up by the Soldiers, or a few Electors, hardly three can be nam'd who de&s;erv'd that Honour, and mo&s;t of them were &s;uch as &s;eem'd to be born for Plagues to Mankind.</P>
<P>4. He manife&s;ts his fraud or ignorance in attributing the Legi&s;lative power &s;ometimes to the Senat, and &s;ometimes to the People; for the Se|nat never had it. The &s;tile of <HI>Senatus cen&s;uit, Populus ju&s;&s;it,</HI> was never alter'd; but the right of Advi&s;ing continuing in the Senat, that of En|acting ever continu'd in the People.</P>
<P>5. An occa&s;ion of commending ab&s;olute Power, in order to the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of Hereditary Monarchy, is ab&s;urdly drawn from their Cu|&s;tom of creating a Dictator in time of danger; for no man was ever crea|ted, but &s;uch as &s;eem'd able to bear &s;o great a burden, which in hereditary Governments is wholly left to chance. Tho his Power was great, it did ari&s;e from the Law; and being confin'd to &s;ix months, 'twas almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible for any man to abu&s;e it, or to corrupt &s;o many of tho&s;e who had enjoy'd the &s;ame honour, or might a&s;pire to it, as to bring them for his plea&s;ure to betray their Country: and as no man was ever cho&s;en who had not given great te&s;timonys of his Vertues, &s;o no one did ever for&s;eit the good opinion conceiv'd of him. Vertue was then honour'd, and thought &s;o nece&s;&s;arily to comprehend a &s;incere love and fidelity to the Commonwealth, that without it the mo&s;t eminent qualitys were reputed vile and odious; and the memory of former Services could no way ex|piate the guilt of con&s;piring again&s;t it. This &s;eeming Severity was in truth the greate&s;t Clemency: for tho our Author has the impudence to &s;ay, that during the <HI>Roman Liberty the be&s;t men thriv'd wor&s;t, and the wor&s;t be&s;t,</HI> he cannot alledg one example of any eminent <HI>Roman</HI> put to death (except <HI>Manlius Capitolinus)</HI> from the expul&s;ion of the <HI>Tarquins</HI> to the time of the <HI>Gracchi,</HI> and the Civil Wars not long after en&s;uing; and of very few who were bani&s;h'd. By the&s;e means Crimes were prevented; and the temptations to evil being remov'd, Treachery was de&s;troy'd in the root; and &s;uch as might be naturally ambitious, were made to &s;ee there was no other way to Honour and Power, than by acting ver|tuou&s;ly.</P>
<P>But le&s;t this &s;hould not be &s;ufficient to re&s;train a&s;piring men, what Power &s;oever was granted to any Magi&s;trate, the Sovereignty &s;till re|main'd in the People, and all without exception were &s;ubject to them. This may &s;eem &s;trange to tho&s;e who think the Dictators were ab&s;olute, becau&s;e they are &s;aid to have bin <HI>&s;ine provocatione;</HI> but that is to be only under&s;tood in relation to other Magi&s;trats, and not to the People, as is clearly prov'd in the ca&s;e of <HI>Q.

<P>LIttle pains is requir'd to confute our Author, who imputes much blood&s;hed to the popular Government of <HI>Rome;</HI> for he cannot prove that one man was unju&s;tly put to death, or &s;lain in any Sedition before <HI>Publius Gracchus:</HI> The Foundations of the Commonwealth were then &s;o &s;haken, that the Laws could not be executed; and what&s;oever did then fall out, ought to be attributed to the Monarchy for which the great Men began to contend.

  unruly and &s;editious; 'twas hard, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to pre&s;erve a Civil equality, when the Spoils of the greate&s;t Kingdoms were brought to adorn the Hou&s;es of private men; and they who had the greate&s;t Ci|tys and Nations to be their Dependents and Clients, were apt to &s;corn the power of the Law. This was a mo&s;t dangerous Di&s;ea&s;e, like tho&s;e to which human Bodys are &s;ubject, when arriv'd to that which Phy&s;icians call the Athletick habit, proceeding from the highe&s;t perfection of Health, Activity and Strength, that the be&s;t Con&s;titution by Diet and Exerci&s;e can attain.

and all that our Author blames, is not to be imputed to their Con&s;titution, but their departing from it. All men were ever &s;ubject to error, and it may be &s;aid that the mi&s;taken People in the &s;pace of about three hundred years did unju&s;tly fine or bani&s;h five or &s;ix men; but tho&s;e mi&s;takes were &s;o frankly acknowledg'd, and carefully repair'd by Honours be&s;tow'd upon the injur'd Per&s;ons, as appears by the Examples of <HI>Camillus, Livius Sali|nator, Paulus Emylius,</HI> and others, that they de&s;erve more prai&s;e than if they had not fail'd.</P>
<P>If for the above-mention'd time Seditions were harmle&s;s or profitable, they were al&s;o ab&s;olutely exempted from Civil Wars. Tho&s;e of <HI>Apulia</HI> and <HI>Greece</HI> were Revolts of conquer'd Nations, and can no way fall un|der that name: But 'tis mo&s;t ab&s;urdly apply'd to the &s;ervile and gladiato|rian Wars; for the Gladiators were Slaves al&s;o, and Civil Wars can be made only by tho&s;e who are Members of the Civil Society, which Slaves are not. Tho&s;e that made the <HI>bellum Sociale,</HI> were Freemen, but not Ci|tizens; and the War they made could not be call'd Civil. The <HI>Romans</HI> had three ways of dealing with conquer'd Nations.</P>
<P>1. Some were receiv'd into the body of the City, <HI>Civitate donati,</HI> as the <HI>Latins</HI> by <HI>Romulus;</HI> the <HI>Albans</HI> by <HI>Ho&s;tilius;</HI> the <HI>Privernates</HI> when their Amba&s;&s;ador declar'd, that no Peace could be durable unle&s;s it were ju&s;t and ea&s;y; and the Senat &s;aid, <HI>Se viri &amp; liberi vocem audivi&s;&s;e, ta|le&s;&abque; dignos e&s;&s;e ut Romani &s;iant;</HI> and the like Favour was &s;hown to many others.</P>

when the Laws, by which it had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, were enervated; &s;o tho&s;e   that happen'd between <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Pompey, Octavius</HI> and <HI>Antonius,</HI> with the Pro&s;criptions, Triumvirate, and all the Mi&s;chiefs that accompany'd them, are to be imputed wholly to the Monarchy for which they con|tended, as well as tho&s;e between <HI>Nero, Galba, Otho, Vitellius,</HI> and <HI>Ve&s;|pa&s;ian,</HI> that hardly ever ceas'd till the Empire was aboli&s;h'd; for the name of a Commonwealth continu'd to the end; and I know not why <HI>Tiberius</HI> or <HI>Nero</HI> might not u&s;e it as well as <HI>Sylla</HI> or <HI>Marius.</HI></P>
<P>Yet if our Author be re&s;olv'd to impute to Popular Government all that pa&s;s'd before <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> made him&s;elf perpetual Dictator, he will find no more than is &s;een in all places. We have known few &s;mall States, and no great one free from Revolts of Subjects or Allies; and the greate&s;t Empire of the Ea&s;t was overthrown by the rebellion of the <HI>Mammalukes</HI> their Slaves. If there is any difference to be ob&s;erv'd between what happen'd at <HI>Rome,</HI> 'tis chiefly, that whil&s;t there was any &s;hadow of Liberty, the Slaves, Gladiators, Subjects or Allies, were always beaten and &s;uppre&s;s'd; whereas in the time of the Emperors, the Revolt of a Province was &s;ufficient to give a new Ma&s;ter to the be&s;t part of Mankind; and he having no more power than was requir'd for a pre&s;ent Mi&s;chief, was for the mo&s;t part, in a &s;hort time, de&s;troy'd by another. But to plea&s;e our Author, I will acknowledg a &s;econd defect, even that Wantonne&s;s to which he a&s;cribes all their Di&s;orders; tho I mu&s;t withal de&s;ire him to con&s;ider from whence Wantonne&s;s dos proceed. If the People of <HI>Turky</HI> or <HI>France</HI> did rebel, I &s;hould think they were driven to it by Mi&s;ery, Beggery, or De&s;pair; and could lay Wantonne&s;s only to the charge of tho&s;e who enjoy much Pro&s;perity. Nations that are oppre&s;t and made mi&s;erable, may fall into Rage, but can never grow wanton. In the time of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, the Pretorian Cohorts, or the Armys that had the liberty of ravaging the riche&s;t Provinces, might be proud of their Strength, or grow wanton thro the abundance of their Enjoyments: The Janizarys in later Ages may, for the &s;ame rea&s;ons, have fallen into the like exce&s;&s;es; but &s;uch as have lo&s;t their Liberty are in no danger of them. When all the Nobility of <HI>Rome</HI> was de&s;troy'd, and tho&s;e who excel'd in Reputation or Vertue, were fallen in the Wars, or by the Pro|&s;criptions; when two thirds of the People were &s;lain, the be&s;t Citys and Colonys burnt, the Provinces exhau&s;ted, and the &s;mall remains left in them oppre&s;t with a mo&s;t mi&s;erable &s;lavery, they may have revolted, and &s;ometimes did, as the <HI>Britans, Batavians,</HI> and others mention'd in the <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;tory: But they were driven to tho&s;e Revolts by Fury and Nece&s;&s;ity, ari&s;ing from the Mi&s;erys and Indignitys they &s;uffer'd under an in&s;upportable Tyranny; and Wantonne&s;s had no part in them. The People of <HI>Rome,</HI> when they were a little freed from the Terror of the Soldiers, did &s;ometimes for the &s;ame rea&s;ons con&s;pire again&s;t the Empe|rors; and when they could do no more, expre&s;t their hatred by breaking their Statues: But after the Battels of <HI>Phar&s;alia, Philippi,</HI> and the Pro|&s;criptions, they never committed any folly thro Wantonne&s;s. In the like manner <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Sicily</HI> have revolted within the&s;e few years; and &s;ome who are well acquainted with the State of tho&s;e Kingdoms, think them ready again to do the like: but if it &s;hould &s;o happen, no man of un|der&s;tanding would impute it to Wantonne&s;s. The Pre&s;&s;ures under which they groan, have cur'd 'em of all &s;uch Di&s;ea&s;es; and the <HI>Romans</HI> after the lo&s;s of their Liberty could never fall into them.

For the illu&s;tration of which, I de&s;ire the&s;e few things may be con&s;ider'd.</P>
<P>1. That the fir&s;t Monarchy of <HI>Rome</HI> was not ab&s;olute: The Kings were made by the People without regard to any Man's Title, or other rea|&s;on than the common Good, chu&s;ing him that &s;eem'd mo&s;t likely to procure it; &s;etting up at the &s;ame time a Senat con&s;i&s;ting of a hundred of the mo&s;t eminent Men among them; and, after the reception of the <HI>Sabins</HI> into the City, adding as many more to them, and committing the principal part of the Government to their care, retaining the power of making tho&s;e Laws to which the Kings who reign'd by their Command were &s;ub|ject, and re&s;erving to them&s;elves the Judgment of all great Matters upon Appeal. If any of their Kings de&s;erv'd to be call'd a Monarch, according to <HI>Filmer</HI>'s Definition, it was the la&s;t <HI>Tarquin;</HI> for he alone of all their <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.

If he had continu'd, he had cur'd the People of all Vices proceeding from Wantonne&s;s; but his farthe&s;t Conque&s;t was of the &s;mall Town of <HI>Gabii</HI> ten miles di&s;tant from <HI>Rome,</HI> which he effected by the fraud of his dete&s;ta|ble Son; and that being then the utmo&s;t limit of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, mu&s;t de&s;erve to be call'd the World, or the Empire of it was not gain'd by their Kings.</P>
<P>2. The Extent of Conque&s;ts is not the only, nor the chief thing that ought to be con&s;ider'd in them; regard is to be had to the Means whereby they are made, and the Valour or Force that was employ'd by the Ene|my.

But I deny that the <HI>Romans</HI> did ever make any con&s;iderable acqui&s;ition after the lo&s;s of their Liberty. They had already &s;ubdu'd all <HI>Italy, Greece, Macedon,</HI> the I&s;lands of the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea, <HI>Thracia, Illyrium, A&s;ia</HI> the Le&s;s, <HI>Pontus, Armenia, Syria, Egypt, Africa, Gaul</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI> The Forces of <HI>Germany</HI> were broken; a Bridg laid over the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and all the Countrys on this &s;ide &s;ubdu'd. This was all that was ever gain'd by the Valour of their own Forces, and that could bring either Honour or Profit. But I know of no Conque&s;t made after that time, unle&s;s the name of Conque&s;t be gi|ven to <HI>Caligula</HI>'s Expedition, when he &s;aid he had &s;ubdu'd the Sea, in making an u&s;ele&s;s Bridg from <HI>Puteoli</HI> to <HI>Baiae;</HI> or that of the other Fool, who enter'd <HI>Rome</HI> in triumph, for having gather'd &s;hells on the Sea|&s;hore. <HI>Trajan</HI>'s Expedition into the Ea&s;t, was rather a Journy than a War: He rambled over the Provinces that <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> had abandon'd as not worth keeping, and others that had nothing to defend them, but ill|arm'd and unwarlike Barbarians: Upon the whole matter, he &s;eems to have bin led only by Curio&s;ity; and the vanity of looking upon them as Conque&s;ts, appears in their being relinqui&s;h'd as &s;oon as gain'd. <HI>Britain</HI> was ea&s;ily taken from a naked and unskilful, tho a brave People; hardly kept, and &s;hamefully lo&s;t. But tho the Emperors had made greater Wars than the Commonwealth, vanqui&s;h'd Nations of more valour and skill than their <HI>Italian</HI> Neighbours, the <HI>Grecians</HI> or <HI>Carthaginians;</HI> &s;ub|du'd and &s;laughter'd tho&s;e that in Numbers and Ferocity had exceeded the <HI>Cimbri, Gauls</HI> and <HI>Teutons,</HI> encounter'd Captains more formidable than <HI>Pirrhus</HI> and <HI>Hannibal,</HI> it might indeed increa&s;e the Glory of him that &s;hould have done it, but could add nothing of Honour or Advantage to the <HI>Roman</HI> Name: The Nobility was extirpated long before, the People corrupted and en&s;lav'd, <HI>Italy</HI> lay de&s;olate, &s;o as a <HI>Roman</HI> was hardly to be found in a <HI>Roman</HI> Army, which was generally compos'd of &s;uch, as fight|ing for them&s;elves or their Commander, never thought of any thing le&s;s than the Intere&s;t of <HI>Rome.</HI> And as it is impo&s;&s;ible that what is &s;o neglected and betray'd, &s;hould be durable, that Empire which was acquir'd by the Valour and Conduct of the brave&s;t and be&s;t di&s;ciplin'd People of the World, decay'd and peri&s;h'd in the hands of tho&s;e Ab&s;olute Monarchs who ought to have pre&s;erv'd it.</P>
<P>3. Peace is de&s;irable by a State that is con&s;tituted for it, who contenting them&s;elves with their own Territorys, have no de&s;ires of enlarging them: Or perhaps it might &s;imply de&s;erve prai&s;e, if Mankind were &s;o fram'd, that a People intending hurt to none, could pre&s;erve them&s;elves; but the World being &s;o far of another temper, that no Nation can be &s;afe without Valour and Strength, tho&s;e Governments only de&s;erve to be commended, which by Di&s;ciplin and Exerci&s;e increa&s;e both, and the <HI>Roman</HI> above all, that excel'd in both. Peace therefore may be good in its &s;ea&s;on, and was &s;o in <HI>Numa</HI>'s Reign; yet two or three &s;uch Kings would have encou|rag'd &s;ome active Neighbours to put an end to that a&s;piring City, be|fore its Territory had extended beyond <HI>Fidenae.</HI> But the Di&s;ciplin that
<PB N="110" REF="118">
  be&s;t agreed with the Temper and De&s;igns of a Warlike People, being renew'd by his brave Succe&s;&s;ors, the Dangers were put on their Enemys; and all of them, the la&s;t only excepted, per&s;i&s;ting in the &s;ame way, did rea&s;onably well perform their Duty. When they were remov'd, and the Affairs of the City depended no longer upon the Temper or Capacity of one Man, the ends for which the City was con&s;tituted were vigorou&s;ly pur&s;u'd, and &s;uch Magi&s;trats annually cho&s;en, as would not long continue in a univer&s;al Peace, till they had gotten the Empire to which they a&s;pir'd, or were by ill Fortune brought to &s;uch weakne&s;s, as to be no longer able to make War. Both of the&s;e happen'd in the &s;o much magnify'd Reign of <HI>Augustus.</HI> He found the Empire &s;o great, that all Additions might rationally be rejected as u&s;ele&s;s or prejudicial; and <HI>Italy</HI> &s;o exhau&s;ted, that Wars could only be carry'd on by the &s;trength of Strangers: It was time to lie &s;till when they had no power to act; and they might do it &s;afely, whil&s;t the Reputation gain'd by former Victorys pre&s;erv'd them from Foreign Inva&s;ions. When <HI>Cra&s;&s;us, Pompey,</HI> and <HI>Ce&s;ar,</HI> who had torn the Commonwealth into three Monarchys, were kill'd, and the Flower of the <HI>Roman</HI> Nobility and People de&s;troy'd with them, or by them: When <HI>Cato</HI>'s Vertue had prov'd too weak to &s;upport a falling State, and <HI>Brutus</HI> with <HI>Ca&s;&s;ius</HI> had peri&s;h'd in their noble Attempt to re&s;tore their Liberty: When the be&s;t part of the Senat had bin expos'd for a Prey to the Vulturs and Wolves of <HI>The&s;&s;aly,</HI> and one hundred and thirty of tho&s;e who de|&s;erv'd the hatred of Tyrants, and had e&s;cap'd the fury of War, had bin de&s;troy'd by the Pro&s;criptions: When neither Captains nor Soldiers remain'd in the de&s;olate City; when the Tyrant abhor'd and fear'd all tho&s;e who had either Reputation or Vertue, and by the mo&s;t &s;ubtil Arts endeavour'd &s;o to corrupt or break the Spirits of the remaining People, that they might not think of their former Greatne&s;s, or the ways of re|covering it, we ought not to wonder that they ceas'd from War. But &s;uch a Peace is no more to be commended, than that which Men have in the Grave; as in the Epitaph of the Marque&s;s <HI>Trivultio</HI> &s;een at <HI>Milan, Qui nunquam quievit, quie&s;cit, tace.</HI> This Peace is in every Wilderne&s;s: The Turks have e&s;tabli&s;h'd it in the empty Provinces of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Greece.</HI> Where there are no men, or if tho&s;e men have no Courage, there can be no War. Our Ance&s;tors the <HI>Britans</HI> ob&s;erv'd, that the Peace which in that Age the <HI>Romans</HI> e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the Provinces, con&s;i&s;ted in the mo&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">C.

The Countrys were ve|ry quiet, when wild Bea&s;ts only were left to fight in them, or a few mi|&s;erable Wretches, who had neither &s;trength nor courage to re&s;i&s;t their violence. This was the Peace the <HI>Romans</HI> enjoy'd under <HI>Augu&s;tus:</HI> A few of tho&s;e who made them&s;elves &s;ub&s;ervient to his Plea&s;ure, and Mini|&s;ters of the publick Calamitys, were put into a flouri&s;hing condition; but the re&s;t pin'd, wither'd, and never recover'd. If yet our Author will have us to think the Liberty and People of <HI>Rome</HI> oblig'd to <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> who procur'd &s;uch a Peace for them, he ought to remember that be&s;ides what they &s;uffer'd in &s;ettling it, they paid dear for it even in the future; for <HI>Italy</HI> was thereby &s;o weaken'd, as never to recover any &s;trength or ver|tue to de&s;end it &s;elf; but depending ab&s;olutely upon barbarous Nations, or Armys compos'd of them, was ravag'd and torn in pieces by every In|vader.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="119">
4. That Peace is only to be valu'd which is accompany'd with Ju&s;tice;   and tho&s;e Governments only de&s;erve prai&s;e, who put the Power into the hands of the be&s;t Men. This was wholly wanting during the Reigns of <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> and his Succe&s;&s;ors. The wor&s;t of men gain'd the Sovereignty by Alliance, Fraud, or Violence, and advanc'd &s;uch as mo&s;t re&s;embled them&s;elves. <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> was wor&s;e in the beginning than in the latter end of his Reign; but his bloody and impure Succe&s;&s;or grew every day more wicked as long as he liv'd: Whil&s;t he &s;at upon the Rocks at <HI>Capreae</HI> with his <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> he meditated nothing but Lu&s;t or Mi&s;chief, and had <HI>Sejanus</HI> and <HI>Macro</HI> always ready to execute his dete&s;table De&s;igns. <HI>Cali|gula</HI> could find none equal to him&s;elf in all manner of Villanys; but &s;a|vour'd tho&s;e mo&s;t who were like&s;t to him. <HI>Claudius</HI> his &s;tupidity, drun|kenne&s;s, and &s;ubjection to the fury of two impudent Strumpets, and manumis'd Slaves, prov'd as hurtful to the Empire, as the &s;avage fury of his Predece&s;&s;or. Tho <HI>Nero</HI> was a Mon&s;ter that the World could not bear, yet the raging Soldiers kill'd <HI>Galba,</HI> and gave the Empire to <HI>Otho</HI> for no other rea&s;on, than that he had bin the Companion of his De|bauches, and of all men was thought mo&s;t to re&s;emble him. With them all Evils came in like a Flood; and their Succe&s;&s;ors finding none &s;o bad as them&s;elves, but the Favorites, Whores and Slaves that govern'd them, would &s;uffer no Vertue to grow up; and fill'd the City with a ba&s;e, leud, and mi&s;erable Rabble, that car'd for nothing beyond Stage-plays and Bread. Such a People could not be &s;editious; but <HI>Rome</HI> had bin de&s;o|late, if they had not thus fill'd it. And tho this temper and condition of a People may plea&s;e our Author; yet it was an incurable Wound to the State, and in con&s;equence to the be&s;t part of the World.</P>
<P>When the City had bin burnt by the <HI>Gauls,</HI> it was &s;oon re&s;tor'd: The Defeats of <HI>Ticinum, Trebia, Thra&s;imene,</HI> and <HI>Cannae,</HI> were repair'd with equal or greater Victorys: The War of the Allies ended in their over|throw: The Fury of the Gladiators was extingui&s;h'd with their Blood: The Commonwealth lo&s;t Battels, but was never conquer'd in any War: and in the end triumph'd over all that had contended with them. Whil&s;t Liberty continu'd, it was the Nur&s;e of Vertue; and all the Lo&s;&s;es &s;uf|fer'd in Foreign or Civil Wars, were ea&s;ily recover'd: but when Liber|ty was lo&s;t, Valour and Vertue was torn up by the roots, and the <HI>Roman</HI> Power proceeding from it, peri&s;h'd.</P>
<P>I have not dwelt &s;o long upon this point to expo&s;e the folly of our Au|thor, but to &s;how that the abovemention'd Evils did proceed from a per|manent cau&s;e, which will always produce the like effects; and Hi&s;torys te&s;tify, that it has done the &s;ame in all places. <HI>Carthage</HI> was rebuilt, af|ter i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> had bin de&s;troy'd by <HI>Scipio,</HI> and continu'd to be a rich City for al|mo&s;t a thou&s;and years, but produc'd no &s;uch Men as <HI>Amilcar, A&s;drubal</HI> and <HI>Hannibal: Cleomenes</HI> and <HI>Euclidas</HI> were the la&s;t that de&s;erv'd to be call'd <HI>Spartans: Athens</HI> never had an eminent Man, after it felt the weight of the <HI>Macedonian</HI> Yoke, and <HI>Philopemen</HI> was the la&s;t of the <HI>Achaians.</HI> Tho the Commonwealths of <HI>Italy</HI> in later Ages, having too much apply'd them&s;elves to the acqui&s;ition of Mony, wanted that greatne&s;s of Spirit which had reign'd in their Ance&s;tors, yet they have not bin without Valour and Vertue. That of <HI>Pi&s;a</HI> was famous for Power at Sea, till the <HI>Genoe&s;es</HI> overthrew them. <HI>Florence</HI> had a brave Nobility, and a &s;tout People. <HI>Arezzo, Pi&s;toia, Cortona, Sienna,</HI> and other &s;mall Towns of <HI>Tu&s;cany,</HI> were not without &s;trength, tho for the mo&s;t part unhappily ex|ercis'd in the Factions of <HI>Ghibelins</HI> and <HI>Guelphs, Neri</HI> and <HI>Bianchi,</HI> that
<PB N="112" REF="120">
  divided all <HI>Italy;</HI> but &s;ince the introduction of <HI>Filmer</HI>'s divine Ab&s;olute Monarchy, all Power, Vertue, Reputation and Strength, are utterly peri&s;h'd from among them, and no man dares to oppo&s;e the publick Mi&s;|chiefs. They u&s;ually decide private Quarrels by A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination or Poi&s;on; and in other re&s;pects they enjoy the happine&s;s of that Peace which is al|ways found within empty Walls and de&s;olated Countrys: And if this be according to the Laws of God and Nature, it cannot be deny'd, that Weakne&s;s, Ba&s;ene&s;s, Cowardice, De&s;truction and De&s;olation are &s;o likewi&s;e. The&s;e are the Ble&s;&s;ings our well-natur'd Author would confer upon us; but if they were to be e&s;teem'd &s;o, I cannot tell why tho&s;e that felt them, com|plain'd &s;o much of 'em. <HI>Tacitus</HI> reciting what pa&s;t in his time, and &s;omewhat before (for want of a Chri&s;tian Spirit) in the bitterne&s;s of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">. Tacit. l. 1.</NOTE>his Soul &s;ays, <HI>Nec unquam atrocioribus Populi Romani cladibus, magi&s;que ju&s;tis indiciis probatum e&s;t, non e&s;&s;e curae Deis &s;ecuritatem no&s;tram e&s;&s;e ultio|nem.</HI> Some thought that no Puni&s;hments could be ju&s;tly de&s;erv'd by a People that had &s;o much favour'd Vertue; others, that even the Gods they ador'd, envied their Felicity and Glory; but all confe&s;s'd they were fallen from the highe&s;t pitch of human Happine&s;s into the lowe&s;t degree of Infamy and Mi&s;ery: And our Author being the fir&s;t that ever found they had gain'd by the change, we are to attribute the di&s;covery of &s;o great a Spirit to the excellency of his Wi&s;dom. If, &s;u&s;pending my Judgment in this point, till it be prov'd by better Authority than his word, I in the mean time follow the opinion of tho&s;e who think Slavery dos naturally produce meanne&s;s of Spirit, with its wor&s;t effect, flattery, which <HI>Tacitus</HI> calls <HI>foedum &s;ervitutis crimen;</HI> I mu&s;t believe, that the Im|pudence of carrying it to &s;uch a height, as to commend nothing in the mo&s;t glorious Liberty, that made the mo&s;t vertuous People in the world, but the &s;hortne&s;s of its continuance, and to prefer the Tyran|ny of the ba&s;e&s;t of Men, or wor&s;t of Mon&s;ters, is peculiar to <HI>Filmer;</HI> and that their wickedne&s;s, which had never bin equal'd, is &s;urpa&s;t by him, who recommends as the Ordinance of God, the Principles that cer|tainly produce them.</P>
<P><HI>But,</HI> &s;ays our Author, <HI>tho</HI> Rome <HI>was for a while miraculou&s;ly upheld in Glory by a greater Prudence than its own, yet in a &s;hort time, after manifold Alterations, &s;he was ruin'd by her own hand.</HI> But 'tis ab&s;urd to &s;ay, that the overthrow of a Government, which had nothing of good in it, can be a ruin; or that the Glory in which it continu'd, had nothing of good in it; and mo&s;t of all, that it could be ruin'd by no hands but its own, if that Glory had not bin gain'd, and immediately or in&s;trumentally &s;upported by &s;uch vertue and &s;trength as is worthily to be prefer'd before all other temporal Happine&s;s, and dos ever produce it. This &s;hews that Liars ought to have good memorys. But pa&s;&s;ing over &s;uch fooli&s;h Contradicti|ons, I de&s;ire to know, how that <HI>Prudence, greater than its own</HI> (which till I am better inform'd, I mu&s;t think to be in&s;eparably united to Ju&s;tice and Goodne&s;s) came miraculou&s;ly to &s;upport a Government, which was not only evil in it &s;elf, as contrary to the Laws of God and Nature; but &s;o perpetually bent again&s;t that Monarchy, which he &s;ays is according to them, as to hate all Monarchs, de&s;pi&s;e all that would live under them, de&s;troy as many of them as came within their reach; and make a Law by which any man was authoris'd to kill him, who &s;hould endeavour to &s;et up this Divine Power among them. Moreover, no human Prudence pre|&s;erv'd the Roman Glory but their own: the others directly &s;et them&s;elves to oppo&s;e it, and the mo&s;t eminent fell under it. We know of no Pru|dence
<PB N="113" REF="121">
&s;urpa&s;&s;ing the human, unle&s;s it be the Divine: But the Divine   Prudence did never miraculou&s;ly exert it &s;elf, except to bear witne&s;s to the Truth, and to give authority to tho&s;e that announc'd it. If therefore the Glory of this Popular Government was miraculou&s;ly &s;upported by a more than human Prudence, it was good in it &s;elf; the Miracles done in favour of it did te&s;tify it, and all that our Author &s;ays again&s;t it is fal&s;e and abominable.</P>
<P>If I lay a&s;ide the word <HI>Miraculous,</HI> as put in by chance, 'twill be hard to know how God (who in the u&s;ual cour&s;e of his Providence guides all things by &s;uch a gentle and undi&s;cern'd Power, that they &s;eem to go on of them&s;elves) &s;hould give &s;uch vertue to this popular Government, and the Magi&s;trats bred up under it, that the greate&s;t Monarchs of the Earth were as du&s;t before them, unle&s;s there had bin an excellency in their Di&s;ciplin, far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing that of their Enemys; or how that can be call'd ill in its Principle, and &s;aid to comprehend no good, which God did &s;o gloriou&s;ly &s;upport, and no man was ever able to re&s;i&s;t. This can|not be better an&s;wer'd than by our Author's Citation, <HI>Suis &amp; ip&s;a Roma viribus ruit;</HI> That City which had overthrown the greate&s;t Powers of the World mu&s;t, in all appearance, have la&s;ted for ever, if their Vertue and Di&s;ciplin had not decay'd, or their Forces bin turn'd again&s;t them|&s;elves. If our Author therefore &s;ay true, the greate&s;t good that ever be|fel the <HI>Romans,</HI> was the decay of their Vertue and Di&s;ciplin; and the turning of their own Arms again&s;t them&s;elves, was not their Ruin but their Pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>When they had brought the warlike Nations of <HI>Italy</HI> into &s;ubjection, or a&s;&s;ociation; often repre&s;t the fury of the <HI>Gauls, Cimbri</HI> and <HI>Teutons;</HI> overthrown the Wealth, Power and Wit of <HI>Carthage,</HI> &s;upported by the Skill, Indu&s;try and Valour of <HI>Hannibal</HI> and his brave Relations; almo&s;t extirpated the valiant <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who would no other way be &s;ubdu'd; defeated <HI>Philip, Per&s;es, Antiochus, Gentius, Syphax</HI> and <HI>Jugurtha;</HI> &s;truck an aw into <HI>Ptolomy;</HI> avoided the &s;nares and poi&s;ons of <HI>Mithridates;</HI> fol|low'd him in his Flights, reveng'd his Treacherys, and carry'd their vic|torious Arms beyond his conquer'd Kingdoms to the Banks of <HI>Tygris:</HI> When neither the Revolt of their <HI>Italian</HI> A&s;&s;ociats, nor the Rebellion of their Slaves led by <HI>Spartacus</HI> (who in skill &s;eems to have bin equal to <HI>Hannibal,</HI> and above him in Courage) could put a &s;top to their Victorys: When <HI>Greece</HI> had bin reduc'd to yield to a Vertue rather than a Power greater than their own, we may well &s;ay that Government was &s;uppor|ted by a more than human prudence, which led them thro Vertue to a height of Glory, Power and Happine&s;s, that till that day had bin un|known to the World, and could never have bin ruin'd, if by the decay of that Vertue they had not turn'd their victorious Arms again&s;t them|&s;elves. That City was a Giant that could die by no other hand than his own; like <HI>Hercules</HI> poi&s;on'd and driven into madne&s;s, after he had de|&s;troy'd Thieves, Mon&s;ters and Tyrants, and found nothing on the Earth able to re&s;i&s;t him. The wi&s;e&s;t of men in antient times, looking upon this as a point of more than human Perfection, thought or feign'd to think, that he was de&s;cended from the Gods, and at his death receiv'd into their number, tho perhaps <HI>Filmer</HI> would prefer a weak, ba&s;e and effeminate Slave before him. The matter will not be much different, if we adhere to the foremention'd &s;imilitude of the <HI>Athletick Habit;</HI> for the danger proceeds only from the perfection of it, and he who di&s;likes it, mu&s;t commend that Weakne&s;s and Vice which may peri&s;h, but can ne|ver
<PB N="114" REF="122">
  be chang'd into any thing wor&s;e than it &s;elf, as tho&s;e that lie upon the ground can never fall. However this Fall of the <HI>Romans,</HI> which our Author, &s;peaking truth again&s;t his will, calls their Ruin, was into that which he recommends as the Ordinance of God: Which is as much as to &s;ay, that they were ruin'd when they fell from their own unnatural In|ventions to follow the Law of God and of Nature; that Luxury al&s;o thro which they fell, was the product of their Felicity; and that the Na|tions that had bin &s;ubdu'd by them, had no other way of avenging their Defeats, than by alluring their Ma&s;ters to their own Vices: This was the Root of their Civil Wars. When that proud City found no more re&s;i|&s;tance, it grew <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>&mdash;Saevior armis</L>
<L>Luxuria incubuit, victum&abque; ulci&s;citur orbem. <BIBL>Lucan.</BIBL></L></Q></NOTE> wanton. Hone&s;t Poverty became unea&s;y, when Ho|nours were given to ill-gotten Riches. This was &s;o Monarchical, that a People infected with &s;uch a Cu&s;tom mu&s;t needs fall by it. They who by Vice had exhau&s;ted their Fortunes, could repair them only by bringing their Country under a Government that would give impunity to Rapine; and &s;uch as had not Vertues to de&s;erve Advancement from the Senat and Peo|ple, would always endeavour to &s;et up a Man that would be&s;tow the Honours due to Vertue, upon tho&s;e who would be mo&s;t abjectly &s;ub&s;er|vient to his Will and Intere&s;ts. When mens minds are fill'd with this Fury, they &s;acrifice the common Good to the advancement of their pri|vate Concernments. This was the temper of <HI>Catiline</HI> expre&s;t by <HI>Sallu&s;t,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sallu&s;t. Bell. Catilin.</NOTE><HI>Luxuria principi gravis, paupertas vix &agrave; privato toleranda;</HI> and this put him upon that de&s;perate extremity to &s;ay, <HI>Incendium meum ruin&acirc; extin|guam.</HI> Others in the &s;ame manner being fill'd with the &s;ame rage, he could not want Companions in his mo&s;t villanous De&s;igns. 'Tis not long &s;ince a Per&s;on of the highe&s;t Quality, and no le&s;s famous for Learning and Wit, having ob&s;erv'd the State of <HI>England,</HI> as it &s;tood not many years ago, and that to which it has bin reduc'd &s;ince the year &s;ixty, as is thought very much by the Advice and Example of <HI>France,</HI> &s;aid, That they were now taking a mo&s;t cruel Vengeance upon us for all the Over|throws receiv'd from our Ance&s;tors, by introducing their mo&s;t damna|ble Maxims, and teaching us the wor&s;t of their Vices. 'Tis not for me to determin whether this Judgment was rightly made or not; for I intend not to &s;peak of our Affairs: but all Hi&s;torians agreeing, that the change of the <HI>Roman</HI> Government was wrought by &s;uch means as I have mention'd; and our Author acknowledging that change to have bin their ruin, as in truth it was, I may ju&s;tly conclude, that the overthrow of that Government could not have bin a ruin to them, but good for them, unle&s;s it had bin good; and that the Power which did ruin it, and was &s;et up in the room of it, cannot have bin according to the Laws of God or Nature, for they confer only that which is good, and de&s;troy nothing that is &s;o; but mu&s;t have bin mo&s;t contrary to that good which was over|thrown by it.</P>

But this no way obliges men to run into the other extreme, in as much as the variety of Forms between mere Demo|cracy and Ab&s;olute Monarchy is almo&s;t infinite: And if I &s;hould under|take to &s;ay, there never was a good Government in the world, that did not con&s;i&s;t of the three &s;imple Species of Monarchy, Ari&s;tocracy and Democracy, I think I might make it good. This at the lea&s;t is certain, that the Government of the <HI>Hebrews</HI> in&s;tituted by God, had a Judg, the great <HI>Sanhedrin,</HI> and General A&s;&s;emblys of the People: <HI>Sparta</HI> had two Kings, a Senat of twenty eight cho&s;en Men, and the like A&s;&s;emblys: All the <HI>Dorian</HI> Citys had a chief Magi&s;trat, a Senat, and occa&s;ional A&s;&s;em|blys: The <HI>Ionian, Athens,</HI> and others, had an <HI>Archon,</HI> the <HI>Areopagi;</HI> and all Judgments concerning matters of the greate&s;t importance, as well as the Election of Magi&s;trats, were refer'd to the People. <HI>Rome</HI> in the be|ginning had a King and a Senat, whil&s;t the Election of Kings, and Judg|ments upon Appeals remain'd in the People; afterwards Con&s;uls repre|&s;enting Kings, and ve&s;ted with equal Power, a more numerous Senat, and more frequent meetings of the People. <HI>Venice</HI> has at this day a Duke, the Senat of the <HI>Pregadi,</HI> and the Great A&s;&s;embly of the Nobility, which is the whole City, the re&s;t of the Inhabitants being only <HI>Incolae,</HI> not <HI>Cives;</HI> and tho&s;e of the other Citys or Countrys are their Subjects, and do not participate of the Government. <HI>Genoa</HI> is govern'd in like man|ner: <HI>Luca</HI> not unlike to them. <HI>Germany</HI> is at this day govern'd by an Emperor, the Princes or great Lords in their &s;everal Precincts, the Citys by their own Magi&s;trats, and by general Diets, in which the whole Pow|er of the Nation re&s;ides, and where the Emperor, Princes, Nobility, and Citys have their places in per&s;on, or by their Deputys. All the Nor|thern Nations, which upon the di&s;&s;olution of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire po&s;&s;e&s;t the be&s;t Provinces that had compos'd it, were under that form which is u&s;ually call'd the <HI>Gothick</HI> Polity: They had King, Lords, Commons, Diets, A&s;&s;emblys of E&s;tates, Cortez, and Parliaments, in which the So|vereign Powers of tho&s;e Nations did re&s;ide, and by which they were exer|cis'd. The like was practis'd in <HI>Hungary, Bohemia, Sweden, Denmark, Poland;</HI> and if things are chang'd in &s;ome of the&s;e places within a few years, they mu&s;t give better proofs of having gain'd by the change than are yet &s;een in the World, before I think my &s;elf oblig'd to change my opinion.</P>
<P>Some Nations not liking the name of King, have given &s;uch a power as Kings enjoy'd in other places to one or more Magi&s;trats, either limited

  to a certain time, or left to be perpetual, as be&s;t pleas'd them&s;elves: Others approving the Name, made the Dignity purely elective. Some have in their Elections principally regarded one Family as long as it la&s;t|ed: Others con&s;ider'd nothing but the fitne&s;s of the Per&s;on, and re|&s;erv'd to them&s;elves a Liberty of taking where they pleas'd. Some have permitted the Crown to be hereditary as to its ordinary cour&s;e; but re&s;train'd the Power, and in&s;tituted Officers to in&s;pect the Proceedings of Kings, and to take care that the Laws were not violated: Of this &s;ort were the <HI>Ephori</HI> of <HI>Sparta,</HI> the <HI>Maires du Palais,</HI> and afterwards the Con|&s;table of <HI>France;</HI> the <HI>Ju&s;ticia</HI> in <HI>Arragon;</HI> the <HI>Rijc&s;hofmei&s;ter</HI> in <HI>Denmark;</HI> the High Steward in <HI>England;</HI> and in all places &s;uch A&s;&s;emblys as are be|fore mention'd under &s;everal names, who had the Power of the whole Na|tion. Some have continu'd long, and it may be always in the &s;ame form; others have chang'd it: Some being incens'd again&s;t their Kings, as the <HI>Romans</HI> exa&s;perated by the Villanys of <HI>Tarquin,</HI> and the <HI>Tu&s;cans</HI> by the Crueltys of <HI>Mezentius,</HI> aboli&s;h'd the name of King: Others, as <HI>Athens, Sici|on, Argos, Corinth, Thebes,</HI> and the <HI>Latins,</HI> did not &s;tay for &s;uch extremitys; but &s;et up other Governments when they thought it be&s;t for them&s;elves, and by this conduct prevented the evils that u&s;ually fall upon Nations, when their Kings degenerate into Tyrants, and a Nation is brought to en|ter into a War by which all may be lo&s;t, and nothing can be gain'd which was not their own before. The <HI>Romans</HI> took not this &s;alutary Cour&s;e; the mi&s;chief was grown up before they perceiv'd, or &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t it; and when the effects of Pride, Avarice, Cruelty and Lu&s;t were grown to &s;uch a height, that they could no longer be endur'd, they could not free them&s;elves without a War: and whereas upon other occa|&s;ions their Victorys had brought them increa&s;e of Strength, Territory, and Glory; the only reward of their Vertue in this was, to be deliver'd from a Plague they had unadvi&s;edly &s;uffer'd to grow up among them. I confe&s;s this was mo&s;t of all to be e&s;teem'd; for if they had bin over|thrown, their condition under <HI>Tarquin</HI> would have bin more intolerable than if they had fallen under the power of <HI>Pirrhus</HI> or <HI>Hannibal;</HI> and all their following Pro&s;perity was the fruit of their recover'd Liberty: But it had bin much better to have reform'd the State after the death of one of their good Kings, than to be brought to fight for their Lives again&s;t that abo|minable Tyrant. Our Author in pur&s;uance of his aver&s;ion to all that is good, di&s;approves this; and wanting rea&s;ons to ju&s;tify his di&s;like, accor|ding to the cu&s;tom of Impo&s;tors and Cheats, has recour&s;e to the ugly terms of a <HI>Back-door, Sedition,</HI> and <HI>Faction:</HI> as if it were not as ju&s;t for a People to lay a&s;ide their Kings when they receive nothing but evil, and can rationally hope for no benefit by them, as for others to &s;et them up in expectation of good from them. But if the truth be examin'd, nothing will be found more orderly than the changes of Government, or of the Per&s;ons and Races of tho&s;e that govern'd, which have bin made by many Nations. When <HI>Pharamond</HI>'s Grand&s;on &s;eem'd not to de&s;erve the Crown he had worn, the <HI>French</HI> gave it to <HI>Meroveus,</HI> who more re&s;embled him in Vertue: In proce&s;s of time when this Race al&s;o degenerated, they were rejected, and <HI>Pepin</HI> advanc'd to the Throne; and the mo&s;t remote in blood of his De&s;cendents having often bin prefer'd before the neare&s;t, and Ba&s;tards before the legitimate I&s;&s;ue, they were at la&s;t all laid a&s;ide; and the Crown remains to this day in the Family of <HI>Hugh Capet,</HI> upon whom it was be&s;tow'd on the rejection of <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Lorrain.</HI> In like manner the <HI>Ca&s;tilians</HI> took <HI>Don Sancho</HI> &s;irnam'd the Brave, &s;econd Son to <HI>Alphon&s;o</HI> the

Wi&s;e, before <HI>Alphon&s;o el De&s;heredado,</HI> Son of the elder Brother <HI>Ferdinand.</HI>   The States of <HI>Arragon</HI> prefer'd <HI>Martin,</HI> Brother to <HI>John</HI> the fir&s;t, before <HI>Mary</HI> his Daughter marry'd to the Count <HI>de Foix,</HI> tho Females were not excluded from the Succe&s;&s;ion; and the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> now enjoys that Crown from <HI>Joan</HI> Daughter to <HI>Ferdinand.</HI> In that and many other King|doms, Ba&s;tards have bin advanc'd before their legitimate Brothers. <HI>Hen|ry</HI> Count of <HI>Tra&s;tamara,</HI> Ba&s;tard to <HI>Alphon&s;o</HI> XI. King of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> receiv'd the Crown as a reward of the good Service he had done to his Country again&s;t his Brother <HI>Peter</HI> the Cruel, without any regard had to the Hou&s;e of <HI>La Cerda</HI> de&s;cended from <HI>Alphon&s;o el De&s;heredado,</HI> which to this day never enjoy'd any greater honour than that of Duke <HI>de Medina Celi.</HI> Not long after the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> conceiving a di&s;like of their King <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> and his Daughter marry'd to <HI>John</HI> King of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> rejected her and her Uncle by the Father's &s;ide, and gave the Crown to <HI>John</HI> a Knight of <HI>Cala|trava,</HI> and Ba&s;tard to an Uncle of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> their King. About the begin|ning of this age the <HI>Swedes</HI> depos'd their King <HI>Sigi&s;mund</HI> for being a Papi&s;t, and made <HI>Charles</HI> his Uncle King. Divers Examples of the like nature in <HI>England</HI> have bin already mention'd. All the&s;e tran&s;portations of Crowns were Acts perform'd by A&s;&s;emblys of the three E&s;tates in the &s;everal King|doms, and the&s;e Crowns are to this day enjoy'd under Titles deriv'd from &s;uch as were thus brought in by the depo&s;ition or rejection of tho&s;e, who according to de&s;cent of blood had better Titles than the pre&s;ent Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors. The Acts therefore were lawful and good, or they can have no Title at all; and they who made 'em, had a ju&s;t power &s;o to do.</P>
<P>If our Author can draw any advantage from the re&s;emblance of Re|gality that he finds in the <HI>Roman</HI> Con&s;uls and <HI>Athenian</HI> Archons, I &s;hall without envy leave him the enjoyment of it; but I am much mi&s;taken if that dos not prove my a&s;&s;ertion, that tho&s;e Governments <HI>were compos'd of the three &s;imple &s;pecies:</HI> for if the Monarchical part was in them, it cannot be deny'd that the Ari&s;tocratical was in the Senat or <HI>Areopagi,</HI> and the Democratical in the People. But he ought to have remember'd, that if there was &s;omething of Monarchical in tho&s;e Governments when they are &s;aid to have bin Popular, there was &s;omething of Ari&s;tocratical and De|mocratical in tho&s;e that were call'd Regal; which ju&s;tifys my propo&s;ition on both &s;ides, and &s;hews that the denomination was taken from the part that prevail'd: and if this were not &s;o, the Governments of <HI>France, Spain,</HI> and <HI>Germany</HI> might be call'd Democracys, and tho&s;e of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Athens</HI> Monarchys, becau&s;e the People have a part in the one, and an image of Monarchy was pre&s;erv'd in the other.</P>
<P>If our Author will not allow the ca&s;es to be altogether equal, I think he will find no other difference, than that the Con&s;uls and Archons were regularly made by the Votes of the con&s;enting People, and orderly re|&s;ign'd their Power, when the time was expir'd for which it was given; whereas <HI>Tarquin, Diony&s;ius, Agathocles, Nabis, Phalaris, Ce&s;ar,</HI> and al|mo&s;t all his Succe&s;&s;ors, whom he takes for compleat Monarchs, came in by violence, fraud, and corruption, by the help of the wor&s;t men, by the &s;laughter of the be&s;t, and mo&s;t commonly (when the method was once e&s;tabli&s;h'd) by that of his Predece&s;&s;or, who, if our Author &s;ays true, was the Father of his Country, and his al&s;o. This was the root and foundation of the only Government that de&s;erves prai&s;e: this is that which &s;tampt the divine character upon <HI>Agathocles, Diony&s;ius</HI> and <HI>Ce&s;ar,</HI> and that had be&s;tow'd the &s;ame upon <HI>Manlius, Marius,</HI> or <HI>Catiline,</HI> if they had gain'd the Monarchys they affected. But I &s;uppo&s;e that &s;uch as

  God has ble&s;t with better judgment, and a due regard to Ju&s;tice and Truth, will &s;ay, that all tho&s;e who have attain'd to &s;uch greatne&s;s as de|&s;troys all manner of good in the places where they have &s;et up them&s;elves by the mo&s;t dete&s;table Villanys, came in by a <HI>backdoor;</HI> and that &s;uch Magi&s;trats as were orderly cho&s;en by a willing People, were the true Shep|herds who came in by the gate of the Sheepfold, and might ju&s;tly be call'd the Mini&s;ters of God, &s;o long as they perform'd their duty in pro|viding for the good of the Nations committed to their charge.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XVII. Good Governments admit of Changes in the Super&s;tructures, whil&s;t the Foundations remain unchangeable.</HEAD>
<P>IF I go a &s;tep farther, and confe&s;s the <HI>Romans</HI> made &s;ome changes in the outward Form of their Government, I may &s;afely &s;ay they did well in it, and pro&s;per'd by it. After the Expul&s;ion of the Kings, the Power was chiefly in the Nobility, who had bin Leaders of the People; but it was nece&s;&s;ary to humble them, when they began to pre&s;ume too much upon the advantages of their Birth; and the City could never have bin great, unle&s;s the Plebeians who were the Body of it, and the main &s;trength of their Armys, had bin admitted to a participation of Ho|nours. This could not be done at the fir&s;t: They who had bin &s;o vilely oppre&s;t by <HI>Tarquin,</HI> and hara&s;s'd with making or clean&s;ing Sinks, were not then fit for Magi&s;tracys, or the Command of Armys: but they could not ju&s;tly be excluded from them, when they had men who in courage and conduct were equal to the be&s;t of the Patricians; and it had bin ab|&s;urd for any man to think it a di&s;paragement to him to marry the Daugh|ter of one whom he had obey'd as Dictator or Con&s;ul, and perhaps fol|low'd in his Triumph. <HI>Rome</HI> that was con&s;tituted for War, and &s;ought its Grandeur by that means, could never have arriv'd to any con&s;iderable height, if the People had not bin exercis'd in Arms, and their Spirits rais'd to delight in Conque&s;ts, and willing to expo&s;e them&s;elves to the greate&s;t fatigues and dangers to accompli&s;h them. Such men as the&s;e were not to be us'd like Slaves, or oppre&s;t by the unmerciful hand of U&s;u|rers. They who by their &s;weat and blood were to defend and enlarge the Territorys of the State, were to be convinc'd they fought for them|&s;elves; and they had rea&s;on to demand a Magi&s;tracy of their own, ve&s;ted with a Power that none might offend, to maintain their Rights, and to protect their Familys whil&s;t they were abroad in the Armys. The&s;e were the Tribuns of the People, made, as they call'd it, <HI>Sacro&s;ancti</HI> or inviolable; and the creation of them was the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Change that happen'd till the time of <HI>Marius,</HI> who brought all into di&s;order. The creation or abolition of Military Tribuns with Con&s;ular Power, ought to be accounted as nothing; for it imported little whether that Au|thority were exercis'd by two, or by five: That of the <HI>Decemviri</HI> was as little to be regarded: they were intended only for a Year; and tho new ones were created for another, on pretence the Laws they were to frame could not be brought to perfection in &s;o &s;hort a time, yet they were &s;oon thrown down from the Power they u&s;urp'd, and endeavour'd to retain contrary to Law: The creation of Dictators was no novelty, they
<PB N="119" REF="127">
were made occa&s;ionally from the beginning, and never otherwi&s;e than   occa&s;ionally, till <HI>Julius Ce&s;ar</HI> &s;ubverted all order, and invading that &s;u|preme Magi&s;tracy by force <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jura omnium in &s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span">.</NOTE>, u&s;urp'd the Right which belong'd to all. This indeed was a mortal Change even in root and principle. All other Magi&s;trats had bin created by the People for the publick good, and al|ways were within the power of tho&s;e that had created them. But <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> coming in by force, &s;ought only the &s;atisfaction of his own raging Ambi|tion, or that of the Soldiers, whom he had corrupted to de&s;troy their Country; and his Succe&s;&s;ors governing for them&s;elves by the help of the like Villains, perpetually expos'd the Empire to be ravag'd by them. But whatever opinion any man may have of the other Changes, I dare affirm, there are few or no Monarchys (who&s;e Hi&s;torys are &s;o well known to us as that of <HI>Rome)</HI> which have not &s;uffer'd Changes incompa|rably greater and more mi&s;chievous than tho&s;e of <HI>Rome</HI> whil&s;t it was free. The <HI>Macedonian</HI> Monarchy fell into pieces immediately after the death of <HI>Alexander:</HI> 'Tis thought he peri&s;h'd by Poi&s;on: His Wives, Children and Mother, were de&s;troy'd by his own Captains: The be&s;t of tho&s;e who had e&s;cap'd his fury, fell by the Sword of each other. When the famous <HI>Argyra&s;pides</HI> might have expected &s;ome Reward of their labours, and a little re&s;t in old age, they were maliciou&s;ly &s;ent into the Ea&s;t by <HI>An|tigonus,</HI> to peri&s;h by hunger and mi&s;ery, after he had corrupted them to betray <HI>Eumenes.</HI> No better fate attended the re&s;t; all was in confu&s;ion, every one follow'd whom he pleas'd, and all of them &s;eem'd to be fill'd with &s;uch a rage, that they never ceas'd from mutual &s;laughters till they were con&s;um'd; and their Kingdoms continu'd in perpetual Wars again&s;t each other, till they all fell under the <HI>Roman</HI> Power. The fortune of <HI>Rome</HI> was the &s;ame after it became a Monarchy: Treachery, Murder and Fury, reign'd in every part; there was no Law but Force; he that could corrupt an Army, thought he had a &s;ufficient Title to the Empire: by this means there were frequently three or four, and at one time thirty &s;e|veral Pretenders, who call'd them&s;elves Emperors; of which number he only reign'd that had the happine&s;s to de&s;troy all his Competitors; and he him&s;elf continu'd no longer than till another dur&s;t attempt the de&s;truction of him and his Po&s;terity. In this &s;tate they remain'd, till the wa&s;ted and bloodle&s;s Provinces were po&s;&s;e&s;t by a multitude of barbarous Nations. The Kingdoms e&s;tabli&s;h'd by them enjoy'd as little Peace or Ju&s;tice; that of <HI>France</HI> was frequently divided into as many parts as the Kings of <HI>Mero|veus</HI> or <HI>Pepin</HI>'s Race had Children, under the names of the Kingdoms of <HI>Paris, Orleans, Soi&s;&s;ons, Arles, Burgundy, Au&s;tra&s;ia,</HI> and others: The&s;e were perpetually vex'd by the unnatural fury of Brothers or neare&s;t Rela|tions, whil&s;t the mi&s;erable Nobility and People were oblig'd to fight up|on their fooli&s;h Quarrels, till all fell under the power of the &s;tronge&s;t. This mi&s;chief was in &s;ome mea&s;ure cur'd by a Law made in the time of <HI>Hugh Capet,</HI> that the Kingdom &s;hould no more be divided: But the <HI>Ap|panages,</HI> as they call them, granted to the King's Brothers, with the &s;e|veral Dukedoms and Earldoms erected to plea&s;e them and other great Lords, produc'd frequently almo&s;t as bad effects. This is te&s;tify'd by the de&s;perate and mortal Factions, that went under the names of <HI>Burgundy</HI> and <HI>Orleans, Armagnac</HI> and <HI>Orleans, Montmorency</HI> and <HI>Gui&s;e:</HI> The&s;e were fol|low'd by tho&s;e of the League, and the Wars of the <HI>Hugonots:</HI> They
<PB N="120" REF="128">
  were no &s;ooner fini&s;h'd by the taking of <HI>Rochel,</HI> but new ones began by the Intrigues of the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> Brother to <HI>Lewis</HI> the 13<HI>th,</HI> and his Mother; and pur&s;u'd with that animo&s;ity by them, that they put them|&s;elves under the protection of <HI>Spain:</HI> To which may be added, that the Hou&s;es of <HI>Conde, Soi&s;&s;ons, Montmorency, Gui&s;e, Vendo&s;me, Angouleme, Bouillon, Rohan, Longueville, Rochefocault, Epernon,</HI> and I think I may &s;ay every one that is of great eminency in that Kingdom, with the Citys of <HI>Paris, Bourdeaux,</HI> and many others, in the &s;pace of the&s;e la&s;t fifty years, have &s;ided with the perpetual Enemys of their own Country.</P>
<P>Again, other great Alterations have happen'd within the &s;ame King|dom: The Races of Kings four times wholly chang'd: Five Kings de|pos'd in le&s;s than 150 Years after the death of <HI>Charles</HI> the Great: The Offices of <HI>Maire du Palais,</HI> and Con&s;table, erected and laid a&s;ide: The great Dukedoms and Earldoms, little inferior to Sovereign Principalitys, e&s;tabli&s;h'd and &s;uppre&s;t: The deci&s;ion of all Cau&s;es, and the execution of the Laws, plac'd ab&s;olutely in the hands of the Nobility, their Deputys, Sene&s;chals, or Vice-Sene&s;chals, and taken from them again: Parliaments &s;et up to receive Appeals from the other Courts, and to judg &s;overeignly in all ca&s;es, expre&s;ly to curb them: The Power of the&s;e Parliaments, af|ter they had cru&s;h'd the Nobility, brought &s;o low, that within the la&s;t twenty years they are made to regi&s;ter, and give the Power of Laws, to Edicts, of which the Titles only are read to them; and the General A&s;|&s;emblys of E&s;tates, that from the time of <HI>Pepin</HI> had the Power of the Nation in their hands, are now brought to nothing, and almo&s;t forgotten.</P>
<P>Tho I mention the&s;e things, 'tis not with a de&s;ign of blaming them, for &s;ome of them de&s;erve it not; and it ought to be con&s;ider'd, that the Wi&s;dom of man is imperfect, and unable to fore&s;ee the Effects that may proceed from an infinite variety of Accidents, which according to Emer|gences, nece&s;&s;arily require new Con&s;titutions, to prevent or cure the mi&s;|chiefs ari&s;ing from them, or to advance a good that at the fir&s;t was not thought on: And as the noble&s;t work in which the Wit of man can be exercis'd, were (if it could be done) to con&s;titute a Government that &s;hould la&s;t for ever, the next to that is to &s;ute Laws to pre&s;ent Exigences, and &s;o much as is in the power of man to fore&s;ee: And he that &s;hould re&s;olve to per&s;i&s;t ob&s;tinately in the way he fir&s;t enter'd upon, or to blame tho&s;e who go out of that in which their Fathers had walk'd, when they find it nece&s;&s;ary, dos as far as in him lies, render the wor&s;t of Errors perpetual. Changes therefore are unavoidable, and the Wit of man can go no farther than to in&s;titute &s;uch, as in relation to the Forces, Manners, Nature, Religion or Intere&s;ts of a People and their Neighbours, are &s;utable and adequate to what is &s;een, or apprehended to be &s;een: And he who would oblige all Nations at all times to take the &s;ame cour&s;e, would prove as fooli&s;h as a Phy&s;ician who &s;hould apply the &s;ame Medicin to all Di&s;tempers, or an Architect that would build the &s;ame kind of Hou&s;e for all Per&s;ons, without con&s;idering their E&s;tates, Dignitys, the number of their Children or Servants, the Time or Climate in which they live, and many other Circum&s;tances; or, which is, if po&s;&s;ible, more &s;otti&s;h, a General who &s;hould ob&s;tinately re&s;olve always to make War in the &s;ame way, and to draw up his Army in the &s;ame form, without examining the nature, number and &s;trength of his own and his Enemys Forces, or the advantages and di&s;advantages of the Ground. But as there may be &s;ome univer&s;al Rules in Phy&s;ick, Architecture and Military Di&s;ciplin, from which men ought never to depart; &s;o there are &s;ome in Politicks al&s;o,
<PB N="121" REF="129">
which ought always to be ob&s;erv'd: and wi&s;e Legi&s;lators adhering to   them only, will be ready to change all others as occa&s;ion may require, in order to the publick Good. This we may learn from <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> who laying the Foundation of the Law given to the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> in that Ju&s;tice, Charity and Truth, which having its root in God, is &s;ubject to no change, left them the liberty of having Judges or no Judges, Kings or no Kings, or to give the Sovereign Power to High Prie&s;ts or Captains, as be&s;t pleas'd them&s;elves; and the Mi&s;chiefs they afterwards &s;uffer'd, proceeded not &s;imply from chang|ing, but changing for the wor&s;e. The like judgment may be made of the Alterations that have happen'd in other places. They who aim at the publick Good, and wi&s;ely in&s;titute means proportionable and adequate to the attainment of it, de&s;erve prai&s;e; and tho&s;e only are to be di&s;lik'd, who either fooli&s;hly or maliciou&s;ly &s;et up a corrupt private Intere&s;t in one or a few men. Who&s;oever therefore would judg of the <HI>Roman</HI> Changes, may &s;ee, that expelling the <HI>Tarquins,</HI> creating Con&s;uls, abating the vio|lence of U&s;urers, admitting <HI>Plebeians</HI> to marry with the <HI>Patricians,</HI> ren|dring them capable of Magi&s;tracys, deducing Colonys, dividing Lands gain'd from their Enemys, erecting Tribuns to defend the Rights of the Commons, appointing the <HI>Decemviri</HI> to regulate the Law, and abrogating their Power when they abus'd it, creating Dictators and Military Tri|buns with a Con&s;ular Power, as occa&s;ions requir'd; they acted in the face of the Sun for the good of the Publick; and &s;uch Acts having always produc'd Effects &s;utable to the rectitude of their Intentions, they con&s;e|quently de&s;erve prai&s;e. But when another Principle began to govern, all things were chang'd in a very different manner: Evil De&s;igns, tending only to the advancement of private Intere&s;ts, were carry'd on in the dark by means as wicked as the end. If <HI>Tarquin</HI> when he had a mind to be King, poi&s;on'd his fir&s;t Wife and his Brother, contracted an ince&s;tuous Mar|riage with his &s;econd by the death of her fir&s;t Husband, murder'd her Fa|ther and the be&s;t men in <HI>Rome,</HI> yet <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> did wor&s;e: He favour'd <HI>Catiline</HI> and his villanous A&s;&s;ociats, brib'd and corrupted Magi&s;trats; con&s;pir'd with <HI>Cra&s;&s;us</HI> and <HI>Pompey;</HI> continu'd in the Command of an Army beyond the time pre&s;crib'd by Law, and turn'd the Arms with which he had bin intru&s;ted for the &s;ervice of the Commonwealth, to the de&s;truction of it; which was rightly repre&s;ented by his Dream, that he had con&s;tuprated his Mother: In the like manner when <HI>Octavius, Antonius</HI> and <HI>Lepidus,</HI> divided the Empire, and then quarrel'd among them&s;elves; and when <HI>Galba, Otho, Vitellius</HI> and <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI> &s;et up Partys in &s;everal Provinces, all was manag'd with Treachery, Fraud and Cruelty; nothing was intended but the advancement of one Man, and the Recompence of the Villains that &s;erv'd him: And when the Empire had &s;uffer'd infinite Calamitys by pulling down or rejecting one, and &s;etting up another, it was for the mo&s;t part difficult to determin who was the wor&s;t of the two; or whe|ther the prevailing &s;ide had gain'd or lo&s;t by their Victory. The que&s;tion therefore upon which a Judgment may be made to the prai&s;e or di&s;prai&s;e of the <HI>Roman</HI> Government, before or after the lo&s;s of their Liberty, ought not to be, Whether either were &s;ubject to changes, for neither they nor any thing under the Sun was ever exempted from them; but whether the Changes that happen'd after the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Ab&s;olute Power in the Emperors, did not &s;olely proceed from Ambition, and tend to the publick Ruin: whereas tho&s;e Alterations related by our Author concern|ing Con&s;uls, Dictators, <HI>Decemviri,</HI> Tribunes and Laws, were far more rare, le&s;s violent, tending to, and procuring the publick Good, and there|fore

  de&s;erving prai&s;e. The like having bin prov'd by the Examples of other Kingdoms, and might be farther confirm'd by many more, which on account of brevity I omit, is in my opinion &s;ufficient to manife&s;t, that whil&s;t the Foundation and Principle of a Government remains good, the Super&s;tructures may be chang'd according to occa&s;ions, without any pre|judice to it.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XVIII. <HI>Xenophon</HI> in blaming the Di&s;orders of Democracys, favours Ari&s;tocracys, not Monarchys.</HEAD>
<P>IN the next place our Author introduces <HI>Xenophon di&s;allowing Popular Governments:</HI> Cites <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Athens</HI> as Places <HI>where the be&s;t Men thriv'd wor&s;t, and the wor&s;t be&s;t;</HI> and condemns the <HI>Romans</HI> for making it capital to pa&s;s Sentence <HI>of Death, Bani&s;hment, lo&s;s of Liberty, or Stripes upon any Citizen of</HI> Rome. But le&s;t his Fraud in this &s;hould be detected, he cites no preci&s;e Pa&s;&s;age of any Author, alledges few Examples, and tho&s;e mi&s;taken; never tells us what that Law was, when made, or where to be found: whereas I hope to prove, that he has upon the whole mat|ter abominably prevaricated, and advanc'd things that he knows to be either impertinent or fal&s;e.</P>
<P>1. To this end we are in the fir&s;t place to con&s;ider, whether <HI>Xenophon</HI> &s;peaks of Popular Governments &s;imply, or comparatively: if &s;imply, 'tis confe&s;t that a pure Democracy can never be good, unle&s;s for a &s;mall Town; if comparatively, we mu&s;t examin to what he compares it: We are &s;ure it was not to Ab&s;olute Monarchy; there was no &s;uch thing a|mong&s;t the <HI>Greeks</HI> e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Law: The little Tyrants who had en|&s;lav'd their own Countrys, as <HI>Ja&s;on, Phaereus, Phalaris,</HI> and the like, had no pretence to it, and were accounted as the wor&s;t of Bea&s;ts: None but &s;uch as in all be&s;tiality were like to 'em, did ever &s;peak or think well of them. <HI>Xenophon</HI>'s Opinion in this point, may be ea&s;ily found out by what pa&s;s'd between his Ma&s;ter <HI>Plato</HI> and the <HI>Sicilian</HI> Tyrant; and the matter will not be mended by referring to his own experience: He had &s;een the va&s;t Monarchy of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> torn in pieces by the fury of two Bro|thers, and more than a million of men brought to fight upon their private quarrel: In&s;tead of that Order, Stability and Strength which our Author a&s;cribes to Ab&s;olute Monarchy as the effect of Wi&s;dom and Ju&s;tice, he knew, that by filling one man with pride and cruelty, it brought un&s;peak|able mi&s;erys upon all others, and infected 'em with all the Vices that ac|company Slavery: Men liv'd like Fi&s;hes, the great ones devour'd the &s;mall; and as appear'd by <HI>Ti&s;&s;aphernes, Pharnabazus,</HI> and others with whom he had to deal, the wor&s;t and ba&s;e&s;t were made to be the greate&s;t: The <HI>Satrapes</HI> in&s;ulted over tho&s;e of meaner rank, with an in&s;olence and cruelty that equal'd the depth of their &s;ervil &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their proud Ma&s;ter. Luxury and Avarice reign'd in all: many great Nations were made to live for the &s;ervice of one man, and to foment his Vices. This produc'd weakne&s;s and cowardice; no number of tho&s;e Slaves were able to &s;tand again&s;t a few free <HI>Grecians.</HI> No man knew this better than <HI>Xe|nophon,</HI> who after the death of <HI>Cyrus</HI> the younger, and the treacherous murder of <HI>Clearchus,</HI> and other Officers that commanded the <HI>Greeks</HI> who
<PB N="123" REF="131">
had &s;erv'd him, made his retreat from <HI>Babylon</HI> to the <HI>Helle&s;pont</HI> with ten   thou&s;and foot, and pa&s;&s;ed over the bellys of all that dar'd to oppo&s;e him. He would never have &s;pent his life in exciting his Countrymen to at|tempt the Conque&s;t of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> nor per&s;uaded <HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI> to put him&s;elf at the head of the Enterprize, if he had thought there was &s;uch admirable Order, Stability and Strength in that Monarchy, and in the <HI>Greeks</HI> no|thing but <HI>giddine&s;s of Spirit, and &s;o much Learning as made them &s;editious:</HI> Nor could he, being a wi&s;e man and an excellent Captain, have conceiv'd &s;uch a de&s;ign, if he had not by experience found that Liberty in&s;pir'd his Countrymen with &s;uch &s;olid Vertue, and produc'd &s;uch Stability, good Order and Strength, that with &s;mall numbers of them he might hope to overthrow the vain Pomp of the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> and to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of their Riches, tho they could bring more than a hundred men to fight again&s;t one; which De&s;ign being interrupted in his time by dome&s;tick Wars, was &s;oon after his death accompli&s;h'd by <HI>Alexander.</HI></P>
<P>But that <HI>Xenophon</HI>'s meaning may be better under&s;tood, 'tis good to con&s;ider, that he &s;poke of &s;uch Governments as were then in u&s;e among the <HI>Greeks;</HI> which tho mix'd, yet took their denomination from the pre|vailing part: &s;o that the <HI>Dorians,</HI> who plac'd the Power chiefly in the hands of a few cho&s;en men, were &s;aid to be govern'd Ari&s;tocratically; and the <HI>Ionians</HI> giving more Power to the common People, Democrati|cally: And he, tho an <HI>Ionian,</HI> either thro friend&s;hip to <HI>Age&s;ilaus,</HI> con|ver&s;ation with the <HI>Spartans,</HI> or for other rea&s;ons be&s;t known to him&s;elf, prefer'd the Government of <HI>Sparta,</HI> or &s;ome other which he thought he could frame, and de&s;ir'd to introduce, before that of <HI>Athens;</HI> as <HI>Cimon, Thucydides,</HI> and many other excellent men of that City are &s;aid to have done: And if I acknowledg they were in the right, and that <HI>Athens</HI> was more &s;ubject to di&s;order, and had le&s;s Stability than <HI>Sparta,</HI> I think it will be of little advantage to Ab&s;olute Monarchy.</P>
<P>2. The <HI>Athenians</HI> did bani&s;h &s;ome worthy men, and put others to death; but our Author, like the Devil, never &s;peaking truth, unle&s;s to turn it into a lie, prevaricates in his report of them. The temporary ba|ni&s;hment, which they call'd <HI>O&s;traci&s;m,</HI> was without hurt or di&s;honour, never accounted as a Puni&s;hment, nor intended for any other end, than to put a &s;top to the too eminent greatne&s;s of a man, that might prove dange|rous to the City; and &s;ome excellent Per&s;ons who fell under it, were &s;oon recall'd, and brought home with glory. But I am not &s;olicitous whether that rea&s;on be &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify it or not: We are upon a general <HI>The&s;is</HI> relating to the Laws of God and Nature; and if the <HI>Athenians,</HI> by a fancy of their own, did make an imprudent u&s;e of their Liberty, it can|not prejudice the publick Cau&s;e. They who make the wor&s;t of it can only &s;ay, that by &s;uch means they, for a time, depriv'd them&s;elves of the benefits they might have receiv'd from the Vertues of &s;ome excellent men, to the hurt of none but them&s;elves; and the application of it as an in|ju&s;tice done to <HI>Themi&s;tocles,</HI> is ab&s;olutely fal&s;e: He was a man of great Wit, Indu&s;try and Valour, but of uncertain Faith, too much addicted to his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. in vit. Themi&s;t.</NOTE>own Intere&s;t, and held a mo&s;t dangerous Corre&s;pondence with the <HI>Per|&s;ians,</HI> who then threaten'd the de&s;truction of <HI>Greece.</HI> Thro envy and &s;pite to <HI>Ari&s;tides,</HI> and to increa&s;e his own Power, he rais'd dangerous Factions in the City, and being &s;ummon'd to render an account of his Pro|ceedings, he declin'd the Judgment of his Country, fled to their Enemys, and ju&s;tly de&s;erv'd the Sentence pronounc'd again&s;t him. Some among them were unju&s;tly put to death, and above all <HI>Socrates;</HI> but the People,
<PB N="124" REF="132">
  who, deceiv'd by fal&s;e Witne&s;&s;es, (again&s;t whom neither the Laws of God or Man have ever pre&s;crib'd a &s;ufficient defence) had condemn'd him, did &s;o much lament their Crime, when the truth was di&s;cover'd to them, that I doubt whether a more righteous Judgment had given bet|ter te&s;timony of their righteous Intentions. But our Author's impudence appears in the highe&s;t exce&s;s, in imputing the death of <HI>Phocion</HI> to the po|pular State of <HI>Athens:</HI> Their Forces had bin broken in the <HI>Sicilian</HI> War; the City taken, and the principal Men &s;lain by <HI>Ly&s;ander;</HI> the remains of the mo&s;t Worthy de&s;troy'd by the thirty Tyrants &s;et up by him; their ill-recover'd Liberty overthrown by the <HI>Macedonians,</HI> and the death of <HI>Phocion</HI> compa&s;t by <HI>Polyperchon,</HI> who with Foreign Soldiers, Slaves, Va|gabonds, and Outlaws, overpower'd the People.</P>
<P>The proceedings of <HI>Rome</HI> may be more compleatly ju&s;tify'd: <HI>Coriola|nus</HI> was duly condemn'd, he &s;et too great a price upon his own Valour, and arrogated to him&s;elf a Power in <HI>Rome,</HI> which would hardly have bin indur'd in <HI>Corioli:</HI> His violence and pride overbalanc'd his Services; and he that would &s;ubmit to no Law, was ju&s;tly driven out from the So|ciety which could &s;ub&s;i&s;t only by Law. <HI>Quintius</HI> was not unlike him, and <HI>Manlius Capitolinus</HI> far wor&s;e than either. Their Vertues were not to be con&s;ider'd when they departed from them. Con&s;ideration ought to be had of human frailty, and &s;ome indulgence may be extended to tho&s;e who commit Errors, after having done important Services; but a State cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t, which compen&s;ating evil Actions with good, gives impu|nity to the mo&s;t dangerous Crimes, in remembrance of any Services whatever. He that dos well, performs his Duty, and ought always to do &s;o: Ju&s;tice and Prudence concur in this; and 'tis no le&s;s ju&s;t than pro|fitable, that every Action be con&s;ider'd by it &s;elf, and &s;uch a reward or puni&s;hment allotted to it, as in nature and proportion it be&s;t de|&s;erves.</P>
<P>This, as I &s;uppo&s;e, is enough for their Ca&s;es; but relates not to tho&s;e of <HI>Mamercus, Camillus, Livius Salinator,</HI> and <HI>Emylius Paulus;</HI> their Ver|tue was compleat, they were wrongfully &s;entenc'd. But the be&s;t Princes, Senat or People that ever was in the world, by the deceit of evil men, may and have bin drawn out of the way of Ju&s;tice: Yet of all the States that are known to us, none was ever &s;o free from Crimes of malice and wilful inju&s;tice; none was ever guilty of &s;o few Errors as that of <HI>Rome;</HI> and none did ever give better te&s;timonys of Repentance, when they were di&s;cover'd, than the <HI>Romans</HI> did by the Veneration they &s;hew'd to tho&s;e worthy Per&s;ons, and the Honors they confer'd upon them afterwards. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Liv.</NOTE><HI>Mamercus</HI> was made Dictator, to repair the unju&s;t mark of Infamy laid upon him by the Cen&s;ors. <HI>Camillus</HI> being recall'd from his bani&s;hment, often enjoy'd the &s;ame honour, and died the mo&s;t reverenc'd Man that had ever bin in that City. <HI>Livius Salinator</HI> was not only made Con&s;ul after he had bin fin'd, but the People (as it were to expiate the guilt of having condemn'd him) &s;uffer'd that a&s;perity of &s;peech and manners, which might have per&s;uaded &s;uch as had bin le&s;s confident of his Vertue and their own, that he de&s;ir'd to be reveng'd, tho it were with the ruin of the City. They dealt in the like manner with <HI>Paulus Emylius,</HI> repairing the injury of a Fine unduly impos'd. Their genero&s;ity in leaving the Tri|buns in the <HI>Forum,</HI> with their Accu&s;ation again&s;t <HI>Scipio Africanus,</HI> and following him to celebrate an annual Sacrifice in the Capitol, in comme|moration of his victory again&s;t <HI>Hannibal,</HI> was no le&s;s admirable than the greatne&s;s of his mind, who thought his Vertue &s;hould be &s;o well known,
<PB N="125" REF="133">
that no account ought to be expected from him; which was an Error   proceeding from a noble Root, but not to be born in a well-govern'd Commonwealth. The Laws that aim at the publick Good, make no di|&s;tinction of Per&s;ons; and none can be exempted from the Penaltys of them, otherwi&s;e than by approv'd Innocence, which cannot appear with|out a Trial: He that will not bend his mind to them, &s;hakes off the e|quality of a Citizen, and u&s;urps a Power above the Law, to which no man &s;ubmits upon any other condition, than that none &s;hould be exemp|ted from the power of it. And <HI>Scipio</HI> being the fir&s;t <HI>Roman</HI> that thus di&s;dain'd the Power of the Law, I do not know whether the prejudice brought upon the City by &s;o dangerous an Example, did not outweigh all the Services he had done: Neverthele&s;s the people contented with his re|tirement to his own hou&s;e, and afterwards convinc'd of his Innocence, would probably (if he had not dy'd in a few months) have brought him back with the Honours that Fate re&s;erv'd for his a&s;hes.</P>
<P>I do not at pre&s;ent remember any other eminent men, who can be &s;aid in any re&s;pect to have <HI>thriv'd ill,</HI> whil&s;t the People and Senat of <HI>Rome</HI> acted freely; and if this be not &s;ufficient to clear the point, I de&s;ire to know the names of tho&s;e <HI>wor&s;t men that thriv'd be&s;t.</HI> If they may have bin judg'd to thrive, who were frequently advanc'd to the &s;upreme Ma|gi&s;tracys, and enjoy'd the chief Honors; I find no men &s;o eminent as <HI>Brutus, Publicola, Quintius Cincinnatus,</HI> and <HI>Capitolinus,</HI> the two <HI>Fabii</HI> &s;irnam'd <HI>Maximi, Corvinus, Torquatus, Camillus,</HI> and the like: and if the&s;e were the wor&s;t Men that <HI>Rome</HI> produc'd in tho&s;e Ages, Valor, Wi&s;dom, Indu&s;try in the Service of their Country, and a mo&s;t intire Love to it, mu&s;t have bin the wor&s;t of qualitys; and I pre&s;ume our Author may have thought them &s;o, &s;ince they were invincible ob&s;tacles to the in|troduction of that Divine Monarchy which <HI>Appius Claudius</HI> the Decem|vir, <HI>Manlius Capitolinus, Spurius Ca&s;&s;ius, Sp. Melius,</HI> and &s;ome others may be thought to have affected.</P>
<P>However, the&s;e in&s;tances are not to be under&s;tood as they are &s;imply in them&s;elves, but comparatively with what has happen'd in other places under ab&s;olute Monarchys: for our inquiry is not after that which is per|fect, well knowing that no &s;uch thing is found among men; but we &s;eek that human Con&s;titution which is attended with the lea&s;t, or the mo&s;t pardonable inconveniences. And if we find that in the &s;pace of three hundred years, while the Senat, People, and legally created Magi&s;trats govern'd <HI>Rome,</HI> not one worthy Man was put to death, not above five or &s;ix condemn'd to Fines by the beguil'd People, and tho&s;e injurys re|pair'd by the mo&s;t honourable &s;atisfaction that could be given; &s;o that Vertue continu'd ever flouri&s;hing; the be&s;t men that could be found were put into the chief Commands, and the City was fill'd with more excel|lent men than were ever known to be in any other place: And on the other &s;ide, if the Emperors &s;o &s;oon as the Government was chang'd, made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to de&s;troy the be&s;t, and &s;o far &s;ucceeded in their de&s;ign, that they left none; and never fail'd to advance the wor&s;t, unle&s;s it fell out as to Queen <HI>Katherine de Medicis,</HI> who is &s;aid never to have done any good but by mi&s;take, and &s;ome few may have prov'd better than was in|tended; it will appear, that our Author's A&s;&s;ertions are in the utmo&s;t de|gree fal&s;e. Of this we need no better witne&s;s than <HI>Tacitus.</HI> The Civil Wars, and the Pro&s;criptions upon which he touches, are ju&s;tly to be at|tributed to that Monarchy which was then &s;etting up, the only que&s;tion being who &s;hould be the Monarch, when the Liberty was already over|thrown.
<PB N="126" REF="134">
  And if any eminent Men e&s;cap'd, it was much again&s;t the will of tho&s;e who had u&s;urp'd the Power: He acknowledges his Hi&s;torys to be a continu'd relation of the &s;laughter of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious Per&s;ons, and that in the times of which he writes, Vertue was attended with certain de&s;truction. After the death of <HI>Germanicus</HI> and his elde&s;t Children, <HI>Vale|rius A&s;iaticus, Seneca, Corbulo,</HI> and an infinite number more who were thought mo&s;t to re&s;emble them, found this to be true at the expence of their lives: <HI>Nero,</HI> in pur&s;uance of the &s;ame tyrannical de&s;ign, murder'd <HI>Helvidius</HI> and <HI>Thra&s;eas,</HI> that he might <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ip&s;am ex&s;cindere virtutem. <BIBL>Tacit.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>tear up Vertue by the roots: Domi|tian</HI> &s;par'd none willingly that had either Vertue or Reputation; and tho <HI>Trajan,</HI> with perhaps &s;ome other, might grow up under him in the re|mote Provinces, yet no good Man could e&s;cape who came under his eye, and was &s;o eminent as to be ob&s;erv'd by him. Whil&s;t the&s;e, who were thought to be the be&s;t Men that appear'd in the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, did <HI>thrive</HI> in this manner, <HI>Sejanus, Macro, Narci&s;&s;us, Pallas, Tigellinus, Icetus, Vin|nius, Laco,</HI> and others like to 'em, had the power of the Empire in their hands. Therefore, unle&s;s Mankind has bin mi&s;taken to this day, and that the&s;e, who have hitherto bin accounted the wor&s;t of Villains, were indeed the be&s;t Men in the world; and that tho&s;e de&s;troy'd by them, who are thought to have bin the be&s;t, were truly the wor&s;t, it cannot be deny'd that the be&s;t Men, during the Liberty of <HI>Rome, thriv'd</HI> be&s;t; that good Men &s;uffer'd no indignity, unle&s;s by &s;ome fraud impos'd upon the well-meaning People; and that &s;o &s;oon as the Liberty was &s;ubverted, the wor&s;t men <HI>thriv'd</HI> be&s;t. The be&s;t Men were expos'd to &s;o many Calami|tys and Snares, that it was thought a matter of great wonder to &s;ee a vertuous man die in his bed: and if the account were well made, I think it might appear, that every one of the Emperors before <HI>Titus</HI> &s;hed more noble and innocent Blood, than <HI>Rome</HI> and all the Commonwealths in the world have done, whil&s;t they had the free enjoyment of their own Liber|ty. But if any man in favour of our Author &s;eeks to dimini&s;h the va&s;t di&s;proportion between the two differing &s;orts of Government, and imputes the di&s;orders that happen'd in the time of the <HI>Gracchi,</HI> and others, whil&s;t <HI>Rome</HI> was &s;trugling for her Liberty, to the Government of a Common|wealth, he will find them no more to be compar'd with tho&s;e that fell out afterwards, than the railings of a turbulent Tribune again&s;t the Senat, to the Villanys and Crueltys that corrupted and di&s;peopl'd the Provinces from <HI>Babylon</HI> to <HI>Scotland.</HI> And whereas the State never fail'd to recover from any di&s;orders, as long as the Root of Liberty remain'd untouch'd, and became more powerful and glorious than ever, even after the Wars of <HI>Marius</HI> and <HI>Sylla;</HI> when that was de&s;troy'd, the City fell into a lan|gui&s;hing condition, and grew weaker and weaker, till that and the whole Empire was ruin'd by the Barbarians.</P>
<P>3.

The Laws were the &s;ame in the time of the Kings, when that Office was executed by Con&s;uls, excepting &s;uch changes as are already mention'd. The <HI>Lex perduellionis</HI> cited by <HI>Livy</HI> in the ca&s;e of <HI>Horatius</HI> who had kill'd his Si&s;ter, continu'd in force from the foundation to the end of that Government: the condemnation was to death, the words of the Sentence the&s;e, <HI>Caput obnubito, infelici arbore re&s;te &s;u&s;pendito; verberato intra Pomaerium vel extra Pomaerium.</HI> He was try'd by this Law upon an appeal made to the People by his Father, and ab&s;olv'd <HI>admiratione magis virtutis quam jure cau&s;ae;</HI> which could not have bin, if by the Law no Citizen might be put to death. The Sons of <HI>Brutus</HI> were condemn'd to death in publick, and executed with the <HI>Aquilii</HI> and <HI>Vitellii</HI> their Companions in the &s;ame Con&s;piracy: <HI>Manlius Capitolinus</HI> was put to death by the vote of the People: <HI>Titus Manlius</HI> by the command of his Father <HI>Torquatus,</HI> for fighting without order: Two Legions were decimated by <HI>Appius Claudius: Spurius Melius</HI> refu|&s;ing to appear before the Dictator, was kill'd by <HI>Servilius Ahala</HI> General of the Hor&s;e, and pronounc'd <HI>jure cae&s;um: Quintus Fabius</HI> was by <HI>Papi|rius</HI> the Dictator condemn'd to die, and could not have bin &s;av'd but by the interce&s;&s;ion and authority of the People. If this be not &s;o, I de|&s;ire to be inform'd what the Senat meant by condemning <HI>Nero</HI> to be put to death <HI>more majorum,</HI> if <HI>more majorum</HI> no Citizen might be put to death: Why the Con&s;uls, Dictators, Military Tribuns, <HI>Decemviri,</HI> caus'd Rods and Axes to be carry'd before them, as well within as with|out the City, if no u&s;e was to be made of 'em. Were they only vain Badges of a Power never to be executed; or upon whom was the Supreme Power &s;ignify'd by them, to be exercis'd within and without the City, if the Citizens were not &s;ubject to it? 'Tis &s;trange that a man who had ever read a Book of matters relating to the Affairs of <HI>Rome,</HI> &s;hould fancy the&s;e things; or hope to impo&s;e them upon the World, if he knew them to be fooli&s;h, fal&s;e, and ab&s;urd. But of all the marks of a mo&s;t &s;upine &s;tupi|dity that can be given by a man, I know none equal to this of our Au|thor, who in the &s;ame Clau&s;e wherein he &s;ays no Citizen could be put to death or bani&s;h'd, adds, that the Magi&s;trats were upon pain of death forbidden to do it; for if a Magi&s;trate might be put to death for bani&s;hing a Citizen, or cau&s;ing him to be executed, a Citizen might be put to death; for the Magi&s;trats were not Strangers, but Citizens. If this was not &s;o, he mu&s;t think that no Crime was capital, but the puni&s;hment of capital Crimes; or that no man was &s;ubject to the Supreme Power, but he that was created for the execution of it. Yet even this will not &s;top the gap; for the Law that condemn'd the Magi&s;trate to die, could be of no effect, if there were no man to execute it; and there could be none if the Law prohibited it, or that he who did it was to die for it: And this goes on to infinity. For if a Magi&s;trate could not put a Citizen to death, I &s;uppo&s;e a Citizen could not put to death a Magi&s;trate; for he al&s;o is a Citizen. So that upon the whole matter we may conclude, that Malice is blind, and that Wickedne&s;s is Madne&s;s. 'Tis hard to &s;ay more in prai&s;e of Popular Governments than will re&s;ult from what he &s;ays again&s;t them: his reproaches are Prai&s;es, and his Prai&s;es reproaches. As Government is in&s;tituted for the pre&s;ervation of the Governed, the <HI>Romans</HI> were &s;paring
<PB N="128" REF="136">
  of Blood, and are wi&s;ely commended by <HI>Livy</HI> for it: <HI>Nulli unquam Popu|lo mitiores placuere poenae;</HI> which gentlene&s;s will never be blam'd, unle&s;s by tho&s;e who are pleas'd with nothing &s;o much as the fury of tho&s;e Mon|&s;ters, who with the ruin of the be&s;t part of Mankind, u&s;urp'd the domi|nion of that glorious City. But if the <HI>Romans</HI> were gentle in puni&s;hing Offences, they were al&s;o diligent in preventing them: the excellence of their Di&s;ciplin led the Youth to Vertue, and the Honors they receiv'd for recompence confirm'd them in it. By this means many of 'em became Laws to them&s;elves; and they who were not the mo&s;t excellent, were yet taught &s;o much of good, that they had a veneration for tho&s;e they could not equal, which not only ferv'd to incite them to do well accord|ing to their Talents, but kept them in &s;uch a w as to fear incurring their ill opinion by any bad action, as much as by the penalty of the Law. This integrity of manners made the Laws as it were u&s;ele&s;s; and whil&s;t they &s;eem'd to &s;leep, ignorant per&s;ons thought there were none: But their Di&s;ciplin being corrupted by Pro&s;perity, tho&s;e Vices came in which made way for the Monarchy; and Wickedne&s;s being plac'd in the Throne, there was no &s;afety for any but &s;uch as would be of the &s;ame &s;pirit, and the Empire was ruin'd by it.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XIX. That Corruption and Venality which is natural to Courts, is &s;eldom found in Popular Governments.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author's next work is, with that mode&s;ty and truth which is natural to him, to impute Corruption and Venality to Common|wealths. He knows that Monarchys are exempted from tho&s;e evils, and has di&s;cover'd this truth from the integrity ob&s;erv'd in the modern Courts of <HI>England, France,</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> or the more antient of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia:</HI> But after many fal&s;hoods in matter of fact, and mi&s;repre&s;entations of that which is true, he &s;hews that the Corruption, Venality, and Violence he blames, were neither the effects of Liberty, nor con&s;i&s;tent with it. <HI>Cneius Manlius,</HI> who with his <HI>A&s;iatic</HI> Army brought in the Luxury that gave birth to tho&s;e mi&s;chiefs, did probably follow the loo&s;ene&s;s of his own di&s;po&s;ition; yet the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t men of that time knew from the be|ginning that it would ruin the City, unle&s;s a &s;top might be put to the cour&s;e of that evil: But they who had &s;een Kings under their feet, and could no longer content them&s;elves with that equality which is nece&s;&s;ary among Citizens, fomented it as the chief means to advance their am|bitious de&s;igns. Tho <HI>Marius</HI> was rigid in his nature, and car'd nei|ther for Mony nor &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ures, yet he favour'd tho&s;e Vices in others, and is &s;aid to be the fir&s;t that made u&s;e of 'em to his advantage. <HI>Catiline</HI> was one of the leude&s;t men in the world, and had no other way of com|pa&s;&s;ing his de&s;igns than by rendring others as bad as him&s;elf: and <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> &s;et up his Tyranny by &s;preading that corruption farther than the others had bin able to do; and tho he, <HI>Caligula,</HI> and &s;ome others were &s;lain, yet the be&s;t men found it as impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;tore Liberty to the City when it was corrupted, as the wor&s;t had done to &s;et up a Tyranny whil&s;t the inte|grity of their manners did continue. Men have a &s;trange propen&s;ity to run into all manner of exce&s;&s;es, when plenty of means invite, and there
<PB N="129" REF="137">
is no power to deter; of which the &s;ucceeding Emperors took advantage,   and knowing that even their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence depended upon it, they thought them&s;elves oblig'd by intere&s;t as well as inclination to make Honors and Preferments the rewards of Vice: and tho it be not always true in the utmo&s;t extent that all men follow the example of the King; yet it is of great effica|cy: Tho &s;ome are &s;o good that they will not be perverted, and others &s;o bad that they will not be corrected; yet a great number dos always follow the cour&s;e that is favour'd and rewarded by tho&s;e that govern. There were Idolaters doubtle&s;s among the <HI>Jews</HI> in the days of <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Heze|kiah;</HI> but they pro&s;per'd better under <HI>Jeroboam</HI> and <HI>Ahab: England</HI> was not without Papi&s;ts in the time of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> but they thriv'd much better during the Reign of her furious Si&s;ter. Fal&s;e Witne&s;&s;es and Accu|&s;ers had a better trade under <HI>Tiberias,</HI> who call'd them <HI>Cu&s;todes Legum,</HI> than under <HI>Trajan</HI> who abhor'd them; and Whores, Players, and Fid|lers, with other &s;uch Vermin, abounded certainly more when encourag'd by <HI>Nero,</HI> than when de&s;pis'd by <HI>Antoninus</HI> and <HI>Marcus Aurelius.</HI> But as every one of the&s;e manife&s;ted what he was by tho&s;e he favor'd or pu|ni&s;h'd, and that a man can only be judg'd by his principles or practices, he that would know whether ab&s;olute Monarchys or mix'd Govern|ments do mo&s;t foment or puni&s;h Venality and Corruption, ought to ex|amin the principle and practice of both, and compare them one with the other.</P>
<P>As to the Principle, the above-mention'd Vices may be profitable to ptivate men, but they can never be &s;o to the Government, if it be popu|lar or mix'd: No People was ever the better for that which renders them weak or ba&s;e; and a duly created Magi&s;tracy, governing a Nation with their con&s;ent, can have no intere&s;t di&s;tinct from that of the Publick, or de&s;ire to dimini&s;h the &s;trength of the People, which is their own, and by which they &s;ub&s;i&s;t. On the other &s;ide, the ab&s;olute Monarch who go|verns for him&s;elf, and chiefly &s;eeks his own pre&s;ervation, looks upon the &s;trength and bravery of his Subjects as the root of his greate&s;t danger, and frequently de&s;ires to render them weak, ba&s;e, corrupt, and unfaithful to each other, that they may neither dare to attempt the breaking of the Yoke he lays upon them, nor tru&s;t one another in any generous de&s;ign for the recovery of their Liberty. So that the &s;ame corruption which pre|&s;erves &s;uch a Prince, if it were introduc'd by a People, would weaken, if not utterly de&s;troy them.</P>
<P>Again, all things have their continuance from a principle in Nature &s;u|table to their Original: all Tyrannys have had their beginnings from cor|ruption. The Hi&s;torys of <HI>Greece, Sicily,</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> &s;hew that all tho&s;e who made them&s;elves Tyrants in &s;everal places, did it by the help of the wor&s;t, and the &s;laughter of the be&s;t: Men could not be made &s;ub&s;ervient to their Lu&s;ts whil&s;t they continu'd in their integrity; &s;o as their bu&s;ine&s;s was to de&s;troy tho&s;e who would not be corrupted. They mu&s;t therefore endeavour to maintain or increa&s;e the corruption by which they attain their greatne&s;s: If they fail in this point, they mu&s;t fall as <HI>Tarquin, Pi&s;i&s;tratus,</HI> and others have done; but if they &s;ucceed &s;o far that the vi|cious part do much prevail, the Government is &s;ecure, tho the Prince may be in danger. And the &s;ame thing dos in a great mea&s;ure accidentally conduce to the &s;afety of his Per&s;on: For they who for the mo&s;t part are the Authors of great Revolutions, not being &s;o much led by a particular hatred to the Man, as by a de&s;ire to do good to the Publick, &s;eldom &s;et them&s;elves to con&s;pire again&s;t the Tyrant, unle&s;s he be altogether dete&s;ta|ble
<PB N="130" REF="138">
  and intolerable, if they do not hope to overthrow the Tyranny.</P>
<P>The contrary is &s;een in all popular and well-mix'd Governments: they are ever e&s;tabli&s;h'd by wi&s;e and good men, and can never be upheld other|wi&s;e than by Vertue: The wor&s;t men always con&s;piring again&s;t them, they mu&s;t fall, if the be&s;t have not power to pre&s;erve them. Where&s;o|ever therefore a People is &s;o govern'd, the Magi&s;trats will obviate afar off the introduction of Vices, which tend as much to the ruin of their Per&s;ons and Government, as to the pre&s;ervation of the Prince and his. This is evidenc'd by experience. 'Tis not ea&s;y to name a Monarch that had &s;o many good qualitys as <HI>Julius Ce&s;ar,</HI> till they were extingui&s;h'd by his Ambition, which was incon&s;i&s;tent with them: He knew that his &s;trength lay in the corruption of the People, and that he could not accom|pli&s;h his de&s;igns without increa&s;ing it. He did not &s;eek good men, but &s;uch as would be for him; and thought none &s;ufficiently addicted to his Intere&s;ts, but &s;uch as &s;tuck at the performance of no wickedne&s;s that he commanded: he was a Soldier according to <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI>'s heart who &s;aid,
<Q><L>Pectore &s;i fratris gladium jugulo&abque; parentis</L>
<L>Condere me jubeas, gravidaeve in vi&s;cera partu</L>
<L>Conjugis, invita peragam tamen omnia dextra. <BIBL>Lucan.</BIBL></L></Q>
And le&s;t &s;uch as were devoted to him &s;hould grow faint in Villany, he indu&s;triou&s;ly inflam'd their fury:
<Q><L>&mdash;Vult omnia Cae&s;ar</L>
<L>A &s;e &s;aeva peti, vult praemia Martis amari. <BIBL>Ib.</BIBL></L></Q>
Having &s;pread this Poi&s;on among&s;t the Soldiers, his next work was by cor|rupting the Tribuns to turn that Power to the de&s;truction of the People, which had bin erected for their pre&s;ervation; and pouring the Trea&s;ures he had gain'd by rapine in <HI>Gaul</HI> into the Bo&s;om of <HI>Curio,</HI> made him an in&s;trument of mi&s;chief, who had bin a mo&s;t eminent Supporter of the Laws. Tho he was thought to have affected the glory of &s;paring <HI>Cato,</HI> and with trouble to have found that he de&s;pis'd life when it was to be ac|counted his gift; yet in &s;u&s;pecting <HI>Brutus</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;&s;ius,</HI> he &s;hew'd he could not believe that vertuous men who lov'd their Country could be his Friends. Such as carry on the like de&s;igns with le&s;s Valor, Wit, and Genero&s;ity of Spirit, will always be more bitterly bent to de&s;troy all that are good, knowing that the deformity of their own Vices is render'd mo&s;t manife&s;t, when they are compar'd with the good qualitys of tho&s;e who are mo&s;t unlike them; and that they can never defend them&s;elves again&s;t the &s;corn and hatred they incur by their Vices, unle&s;s &s;uch a num|ber can be infected with the &s;ame, and made to delight in the recompences of iniquity that foment them, as may be able to keep the re&s;t of the Peo|ple in &s;ubjection.</P>
<P>The &s;ame thing happens even when the U&s;urpation is not &s;o violent as that of <HI>Agathocles, Diony&s;ius,</HI> or the la&s;t King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> who in one day by the &s;trength of a mercenary Soldiery overthrew all the Laws of his Country: and a lawfully created Magi&s;trate is forc'd to follow the &s;ame ways as &s;oon as he begins to affect a Power which the Laws do not confer upon him. I wi&s;h I could &s;ay there were few of the&s;e; but experience &s;hews that &s;uch a proportion of Wi&s;dom, moderation of Spirit, and Ju&s;tice is requir'd in a &s;upreme Magi&s;trate, to render him content with a
<PB N="131" REF="139">
limited Power, as is &s;eldom found. Man is of an a&s;piring nature, and   apt to put too high a value upon him&s;elf; they who are rais'd above their Brethren, tho but a little, de&s;ire to go farther; and if they gain the name of King, they think them&s;elves wrong'd and degraded, when they are not &s;uffer'd to do what they <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Sanctitas, pietas, &s;ides</L>
<L>Privata bona &s;unt: Qua juvat reges eant. <BIBL>Senec. Thyest.</BIBL></L></Q></NOTE> plea&s;e. In the&s;e things they never want Ma&s;ters; and the nearer they come to a Power that is not ea&s;ily re&s;train'd by Law, the more pa&s;&s;ionately they de&s;ire to aboli&s;h all that oppo&s;es it: and when their Hearts are fill'd with this fury, they never fail to chu&s;e &s;uch Mini&s;ters as will be &s;ub&s;ervient to their Will: and this is &s;o well known, that tho&s;e only approach them who re&s;olve to be &s;o. Their in|tere&s;ts as well as their inclinations incite them to diffu&s;e their own manners as far as they can, which is no le&s;s than to bring tho&s;e who are under their power to all that wickedne&s;s of which the nature of man is capable; and no greater te&s;timony can be given of the efficacy of the&s;e means towards the utter corruption of Nations, than the accur&s;ed effects we &s;ee of 'em in our own and the neighboring Countrys.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid that &s;ome Princes are &s;o full of Vertue and Goodne&s;s, as not to de&s;ire more power than the Laws allow, and are not oblig'd to chu&s;e ill men, becau&s;e they de&s;ire nothing but what the be&s;t are willing to do. This may be, and &s;ometimes is: the Nation is happy that has &s;uch a King; but he is hard to find, and more than a human Power is requir'd to keep him in &s;o good a way. The &s;trength of his own affections will ever be again&s;t him: Wives, Children, and Servants will always join with tho&s;e Enemys that ari&s;e in his own brea&s;t to pervert him: if he has any weak &s;ide, any Lu&s;t un&s;ubdu'd, they will gain the victory. He has not &s;earch'd into the nature of Man, who thinks that any one can re&s;i&s;t when he is thus on all &s;ides a&s;&s;aulted: Nothing but the wonderful and im|mediate power of God's Spirit can pre&s;erve him; and to alledg it will be nothing to the purpo&s;e, unle&s;s it can be prov'd that all Princes are ble&s;t with &s;uch an a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or that God has promis'd it to them and their Succe&s;&s;ors for ever, by what means &s;oever they came to the Crowns they enjoy.</P>
<P>Nothing is farther from my intention than to &s;peak irreverently of Kings; and I pre&s;ume no wi&s;e man will think I do &s;o, if I profe&s;s, that having ob&s;erv'd as well as I can what Hi&s;tory and daily Experience teach us concerning the Vertues and Religions that are or have bin from the be|ginning of the World encourag'd and &s;upported by Monarchs, the me|thods they have follow'd &s;ince they have gone under the name of Chri&s;tians, their moral as well as theological Graces, together with what the Scriptures tell us of tho&s;e who in the la&s;t days will principally &s;upport the Throne of Antichri&s;t; I cannot be confident that they are generally in an extraordina|ry manner pre&s;erv'd by the hand of God from the Vices and Frailtys to which the re&s;t of mankind is &s;ubject. If no man can &s;hew that I am in this mi&s;taken, I may conclude, that as they are more than any other men in the world expos'd to temptations and &s;nares, they are more than any in danger of being corrupted, and made In&s;truments of corrupting others, if they are no otherwi&s;e defended than the re&s;t of men.</P>
<P>This being the &s;tate of the matter on both &s;ides, we may ea&s;ily collect, that all Governments are &s;ubject to corruption and decay; but with this difference, that Ab&s;olute Monarchy is by principle led unto, or rooted
<PB N="132" REF="140">
  in it; whereas mix'd or popular Governments are only in a po&s;&s;ibility of falling into it: As the fir&s;t cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t, unle&s;s the prevailing part of the people be corrupted; the other mu&s;t certainly peri&s;h, unle&s;s pre&s;erv'd in a great mea&s;ure free from Vices. And I doubt whether any better rea&s;on can be given, why there have bin and are more Monarchys than popular Governments in the world, than that Nations are more ea&s;ily drawn into corruption than defended from it; and I think that Monarchy can be &s;aid to be natural in no other &s;en&s;e, than that our deprav'd Nature is mo&s;t in|clin'd to that which is wor&s;t.</P>
<P>To avoid unnece&s;&s;ary Di&s;putes, I give the name of Popular Govern|ments to tho&s;e of <HI>Rome, Athens, Sparta,</HI> and the like, tho improperly, unle&s;s the &s;ame may al&s;o be given to many that are u&s;ually called Monar|chys, &s;ince there is nothing of violence in either; the Power is confer'd upon the chief Magi&s;trats of both by the free con&s;ent of a willing People, and &s;uch a part as they think fit is &s;till retain'd and executed in their own A&s;&s;emblys; and in this &s;en&s;e it is that our Author &s;eems to &s;peak again&s;t them. As to Popular Government in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e, (that is pure De|mocracy, where the People in them&s;elves, and by them&s;elves, perform all that belong to Government) I know of no &s;uch thing; and if it be in the World, have nothing to &s;ay for it. In a&s;&s;erting the Liberty, generally, as I &s;uppo&s;e, granted by God to all mankind, I neither deny, that &s;o ma|ny as think fit to enter into a Society, may give &s;o much of their Power as they plea&s;e to one or more men, for a time or perpetually, to them and their Heirs, according to &s;uch Rules as they pre&s;cribe; nor approve the Di&s;orders that mu&s;t ari&s;e if they keep it intirely in their own hands. And looking upon the &s;everal Governments, which under different forms and names have bin regularly con&s;tituted by Nations, as &s;o many undeniable Te|&s;timonys, that they thought it good for them&s;elves and their Po&s;terity &s;o to do, I infer, that as there is no man who would not rather chu&s;e to be go|vern'd by &s;uch as are ju&s;t, indu&s;trious, valiant and wi&s;e, than by tho&s;e that are wicked, &s;lothful, cowardly and fooli&s;h; and to live in &s;ociety with &s;uch as are qualify'd like tho&s;e of the fir&s;t &s;ort, rather than with tho&s;e who will be ever ready to commit all manner of Villanys, or want experience, &s;trength or courage, to join in repelling the Injurys offer'd by others: So there are none who do not according to the mea&s;ure of their under&s;tand|ing, endeavour to &s;et up tho&s;e who &s;eem to be be&s;t qualify'd, and to pre|vent the introduction of tho&s;e Vices which render the Faith of the Ma|gi&s;trate &s;u&s;pected, or make him unable to perform his duty, in providing for the execution of Ju&s;tice, and the publick defence of the State again&s;t Foreign or Dome&s;tick Enemys. For as no man who is not ab&s;olutely mad, will commit the care of a Flock to a Villain, that has neither skill, diligence, nor courage to defend them, or perhaps is maliciou&s;ly &s;et to de|&s;troy them, rather than to a &s;tout, faithful, and wi&s;e Shepherd; 'tis le&s;s to be imagin'd that any would commit the &s;ame error in relation to that Soci|ety which comprehends him&s;elf with his Children, Friends, and all that is dear to him.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Con&s;iderations are of equal force in relation to the Body of every Nation: For &s;ince the Magi&s;trate, tho the mo&s;t perfect in his kind, cannot perform his duty, if the people be &s;o ba&s;e, vicious, effeminate and cowardly, as not to &s;econd his good Intentions; tho&s;e who expect good from him, cannot de&s;ire &s;o to corrupt their Companions that are to help him, as to render it impo&s;&s;ible for him to accompli&s;h it. Tho I believe there have bin in all Ages bad men in every Nation, yet I doubt whether there was
<PB N="133" REF="141">
one in <HI>Rome,</HI> except a <HI>Catiline</HI> or a <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> who de&s;ign'd to make them&s;elves   Tyrants, that would not rather have wi&s;h'd the whole People as brave and vertuous as in the time of the <HI>Carthaginian</HI> Wars, than vile and ba&s;e as in the days of <HI>Nero</HI> and <HI>Domitian.</HI> But 'tis madne&s;s to think, that the whole Body would not rather wi&s;h to be as it was when Vertue flou|ri&s;h'd and nothing upon Earth was able to re&s;i&s;t their power, than weak, mi&s;erable, ba&s;e, &s;lavi&s;h, and trampled under foot by any that would in|vade them; and forc'd as a Chattel to become a prey to tho&s;e that were &s;tronge&s;t. Which is &s;ufficient to &s;hew, that a People acting according to the liberty of their own Will, never advance unworthy men, unle&s;s it be by mi&s;take, nor willingly &s;uffer the introduction of Vices: Whereas the Ab&s;olute Monarch always prefers the wor&s;t of tho&s;e who are addicted to him, and cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t unle&s;s the prevailing part of the People be ba&s;e and vicious.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid, that tho&s;e Governments in which the Democratical part governs mo&s;t, do more frequently err in the choice of men, or the means of pre&s;erving that purity of Manners which is requir'd for the well-being of a People, than tho&s;e wherein Ari&s;tocracy prevails; I confe&s;s it, and that in <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Athens</HI> the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t men did for the mo&s;t part incline to Ari&s;tocracy. <HI>Xenophon, Plato, Ari&s;totle, Thucydides, Livy, Tacitus, Cicero,</HI> and others, were of this &s;ort: But if our Author there &s;eek Pa|trons for his Ab&s;olute Monarchy, he will find none but <HI>Phalaris, Agatho|cles, Diony&s;ius, Catiline, Cethegus, Lentulus,</HI> with the corrupted Crew of mercenary Ra&s;cals, who did, or endeavor'd to &s;et 'em up. The&s;e are they <HI>quibus ex hone&s;to nulla e&s;t &s;pes;</HI> they abhor the Dominion of the Law, becau&s;e it curbs their Vices, and make them&s;elves &s;ub&s;ervient to the Lu&s;ts of a man who may nouri&s;h them. Similitude of Intere&s;ts, Manners, and De&s;igns, is a link of Union between them: Both are Enemys to po|pular and mix'd Government; and tho&s;e Governments are Enemys to them, and by pre&s;erving Vertue and Integrity, oppo&s;e both; know|ing, that if they do not, they and their Governments mu&s;t certainly pe|ri&s;h.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XX. Man's natural love to Liberty is temper'd by Rea&s;on, which originally is his Nature.</HEAD>
<P>THAT our Author's Book may appear to be a heap of Incongrui|tys and Contradictions, 'tis not ami&s;s to add to what has already bin ob&s;erv'd, that having a&s;&s;erted Ab&s;olute Monarchy to be <HI>the only natu|ral Government,</HI> he now &s;ays, <HI>that the nature of all People is to de&s;ire Li|berty without re&s;traint.</HI> But if Monarchy be that Power which above all re&s;trains Liberty, and &s;ubjects all to the Will of one; this is as much as to &s;ay, that all People naturally de&s;ire that which is again&s;t Nature; and by a wonderful exce&s;s of extravagance and folly to a&s;&s;ert contrary Propo|&s;itions, that on both &s;ides are equally ab&s;urd and fal&s;e. For as we have already prov'd that no Government is impos'd upon men by God or Na|ture, 'tis no le&s;s evident, that Man being a rational Creature, nothing can be univer&s;ally natural to him, that is not rational. But this Liberty without re&s;traint being incon&s;i&s;tent with any Government, and the
<PB N="134" REF="142">
  Good which man naturally de&s;ires for him&s;elf, Children and Friends, we find no place in the world where the Inhabitants do not enter into &s;ome kind of Society or Government to re&s;train it: and to &s;ay that all men de&s;ire Liberty without re&s;traint, and yet that all do re&s;train it, is ridi|culous. The truth is, man is hereunto led by Rea&s;on which is his Na|ture. Every one &s;ees they cannot well live a&s;under, nor many together, without &s;ome Rule to which all mu&s;t &s;ubmit. This &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is a re|&s;traint of Liberty, but could be of no effect as to the Good intended, un|le&s;s it were general; nor general, unle&s;s it were natural. When all are born to the &s;ame freedom, &s;ome will not re&s;ign that which is their own, unle&s;s others do the like: This general con&s;ent of all to re&s;ign &s;uch a part of their Liberty as &s;eems to be for the good of all, is the voice of Na|ture, and the act of Men (according to natural Rea&s;on) &s;eeking their own Good: And if all go not in the &s;ame way, according to the &s;ame form, 'tis an evident te&s;timony that no one is directed by Nature; but as a few or many may join together, and frame &s;maller or greater Societys, &s;o tho&s;e Societys may in&s;titute &s;uch an order or form of Government as be&s;t plea&s;es them&s;elves; and if the ends of Government are obtain'd, they all equally follow the voice of Nature in con&s;tituting them.</P>
<P>Again, if man were by nature &s;o tenacious of his Liberty without re|&s;traint, he mu&s;t be rationally &s;o. The creation of Ab&s;olute Monarchys, which intirely extingui&s;hes it, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be mo&s;t contrary to it, tho the people were willing; for they thereby abjure their own Nature. The u&s;urpation of them can be no le&s;s than the mo&s;t abominable and out|rageous violation of the Laws of Nature that can be imagin'd: The Laws of God mu&s;t be in the like mea&s;ure broken; and of all Govern|ments, Democracy, in which every man's Liberty is lea&s;t re&s;train'd, be|cau&s;e every man has an equal part, would certainly prove to be the mo&s;t ju&s;t, rational and natural; whereas our Author repre&s;ents it as a perpe|tual &s;pring of di&s;order, confu&s;ion and vice. This con&s;equence would be unavoidable, if he &s;aid true; but it being my fate often to differ from him, I hope to be excus'd if I do &s;o in this al&s;o, and affirm, that nothing but the plain and certain dictates of Rea&s;on can be generally applicable to all men as the Law of their Nature; and they who, according to the be&s;t of their under&s;tanding provide for the good of them&s;elves and their Po&s;terity, do all equally ob&s;erve it. He that inquires more exactly into the matter may find, that Rea&s;on enjoins every man not to arrogate to him&s;elf more than he allows to others, nor to retain that Liberty which will prove hurtful to him; or to expect that others will &s;uffer them&s;elves to be re&s;train'd, whil&s;t he, to their prejudice, remains in the exerci&s;e of that freedom which Nature allows. He who would be exempted from this common Rule, mu&s;t &s;hew for what rea&s;on he &s;hould be rais'd above his Brethren; and if he dos it not, he is an enemy to them. This is not Popularity, but Tyranny; and Tyrants are &s;aid <HI>exui&s;&s;e hominem,</HI> to throw off the Nature of men, becau&s;e they do unju&s;tly and unrea&s;onably a&s;|&s;ume to them&s;elves that which agrees not with the frailty of human Na|ture, and &s;et up an Intere&s;t in them&s;elves contrary to that of their Equals, which they ought to defend as their own. Such as favour them are like to them; and we know of no Tyranny that was not &s;et up by the wor&s;t, nor of any that have bin de&s;troy'd, unle&s;s by the be&s;t of men. The &s;e|veral Tyrannys of <HI>Syracu&s;e</HI> were introduc'd by <HI>Agathocles, Diony&s;ius, Hieronymus, Hippocrates, Epicides,</HI> and others, by the help of lend, di&s;|&s;olute, mercenary Villains; and overthrown by <HI>Timoleon, Dion, Theo|dorus,</HI>

and others, who&s;e Vertues will be remember'd in all ages. The&s;e,   and others like to them, never &s;ought liberty without re&s;traint, but &s;uch as was re&s;train'd by Laws tending to the publick Good; that all might concur in promoting it, and the unruly de&s;ires of tho&s;e who affected Power and Honours which they did not de&s;erve might be repre&s;t.</P>
<P>The like was &s;een in <HI>Rome:</HI> When <HI>Brutus, Valerius,</HI> and other ver|tuous Citizens had thrown out the leud <HI>Tarquins,</HI> they tru&s;ted to their own innocence and reputation; and thinking them &s;afe under the pro|tection of the Law, contented them&s;elves with &s;uch Honors as their Countrymen thought they de&s;erv'd.

But if our Author &s;ays true, the licentious fury of the&s;e leud young men, who endeavour'd to &s;ubvert the Con&s;titution of their Country to procure the impunity of their own Crimes, would have bin more natural, that is more rea&s;onable than the ordinary proceedings of the mo&s;t vertuous, who de&s;ir'd that the Law might be the rule of their Actions, which is mo&s;t ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>The like vicious Wretches have in all times endeavour'd to put the Power into the hands of one man, who might protect 'em in their Villanys, and advance 'em to exorbitant Riches or unde&s;erv'd Honors; whil&s;t the be&s;t men tru&s;ting in their Innocence, and de&s;iring no other Riches or Pre|ferments than what by their Equals they were thought to de&s;erve, were contented with a due Liberty, under the protection of a ju&s;t Law: and I mu&s;t tran&s;cribe the Hi&s;torys of the World, or at lea&s;t &s;o much of them as concerns the Tyrannys that have bin &s;et up or ca&s;t down, if I &s;hould here in&s;ert all the proofs that might be given of it. But I &s;hall come nearer to the point, which is not to compare Democracy with Monarchy, but a regular mix'd Government with &s;uch an Ab&s;olute Monarchy, as leaves all to the will of that Man, Woman, or Child, who happens to be born in the reigning Family, how ill &s;oever they may be qualify'd. I de&s;ire tho&s;e who are lovers of Truth to con&s;ider, whether the wi&s;e&s;t, be&s;t, and brave&s;t of Men, are not naturally led to be pleas'd with a Go|verment that protects them from receiving wrong, when they have not the lea&s;t inclination to do any? Whether they who de&s;ire no unju&s;t ad|vantage above their Brethren, will not always de&s;ire that a People or Se|nat con&s;tituted as that of <HI>Rome,</HI> from the expul&s;ion of <HI>Tarquin</HI> to the &s;etting up of <HI>Ce&s;ar,</HI> &s;hould rather judg of their Merit, than <HI>Tarquin, Ce&s;ar,</HI> or his Succe&s;&s;ors? Or whether the leud or corrupted Pretorian, Bands, with <HI>Macro, Sejanus, Tigellinus,</HI> and the like, commanding them will not ever, like <HI>Brutus</HI> his Sons, abhor the inexorable Power of the Laws, with the nece&s;&s;ity of living only by their innocence, and favour the Intere&s;t of Princes like to tho&s;e that advanc'd them? If this be not &s;ufficient, they may be pleas'd a little to reflect upon the Affairs of our own Country, and &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider whether <HI>H&mdash;de, Cl&mdash;f&mdash;d, F-lm th, Arl-ng-n</HI> and <HI>D&mdash;nby,</HI> could have pretended to the chief places, if the
<PB N="136" REF="144">
  di&s;po&s;al of them had bin in a free and well-regulated Parliament?

Whether all men, good and bad, do not favour that &s;tate of things, which favours them and &s;uch as they are? Whether <HI>Cl-v-l-d, P-rt&s;m-th,</HI> and others of the &s;ame trade, have attain'd to the Riches and Honors they enjoy by Services done to the Commonwealth?

Whether the old Arts of begging, &s;tealing and bawding, or the new ones of informing and trepanning, thrive be&s;t under one man who may be weak or vicious, and is always &s;ubject to be circumvented by Flatterers, or under the &s;e|vere &s;crutinys of a Senat or People? In a word, whether they who live by &s;uch Arts, and know no other, do not always endeavour to advance the Government under which they enjoy, or may hope to obtain the high|e&s;t Honors, and abhor that, in which they are expos'd to all manner of &s;corn and puni&s;hment? Which being determin'd, it will ea&s;ily appear why the wor&s;t men have ever bin for Ab&s;olute Monarchy, and the be&s;t again&s;t it; and which of the two in &s;o doing can be &s;aid to de&s;ire an un|re&s;train'd Liberty of doing that which is evil.</P>

<P>BEing no way concern'd in the defence of Democracy; and having prov'd that <HI>Xenophon, Thucydides,</HI> and others of the Antients, in &s;peaking again&s;t the over-great Power of the common People, intended to add Reputation to the Ari&s;tocratical Party to which they were addicted, and not to &s;et up Ab&s;olute Monarchy, which never fell under di&s;cour&s;e among them, but as an object of &s;corn and hatred, evil in it &s;elf, and only to be endur'd by ba&s;e and barbarous People; I may leave our Knight, like <HI>Don Quixote,</HI> fighting again&s;t the Phanta&s;ms of his own brain, and &s;aying what he plea&s;es again&s;t &s;uch Governments as never were, unle&s;s in &s;uch a place as <HI>San Marino</HI> near <HI>Sinigaglia</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> where a hundred Clowns go|vern a barbarous Rock that no man invades, and relates nothing to our que&s;tion. If his Doctrin be true, the Monarchy he extols is not only to be prefer'd before unruly Democracy, and mix'd Governments, but is the only one that, without a gro&s;s violation of the Laws of God and Na|ture, can be e&s;tabli&s;h'd over any Nation. But having, as I hope, &s;uf|ficiently prov'd, that God did neither in&s;titute, nor appoint any &s;uch to be in&s;tituted, nor approve tho&s;e that were; that Nature dos not incline us to it, and that the be&s;t as well as the wi&s;e&s;t men have always abhor'd it; that it has bin agreeable only to the mo&s;t &s;tupid and ba&s;e Nations; and if others have &s;ubmitted to it; they have done &s;o only as to the great|e&s;t of Evils brought upon them by Violence, Corruption or Fraud; I may now proceed to &s;hew that the Progre&s;s of it has bin in all re&s;pects &s;utable to its beginning.</P>
<P>To this end 'twill not be ami&s;s to examin our Author's words. <HI>Thus,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>do they paint to the life this Bea&s;t with many heads: Let me give</HI>
<PB N="137" REF="145">
<HI>the Cypher of their Form of Government; as it is begot by Sedition, &s;o it is nouri&s;h'd by Crimes: It can never &s;tand without Wars, either with an Enemy abroad, or with Friends at home.</HI> And in order to this I will not criticize upon the terms, tho the Cypher of a Form, and War with Friends, may be ju&s;tly call'd Non&s;en&s;e; but coming to his A&s;&s;ertions, that popular or mix'd Governments have their birth in Sedition, and are ever after|terwards vex'd with Civil or Foreign Wars, I take liberty to &s;ay, That whereas there is no Form appointed by God or Nature, tho&s;e Govern|ments only can be call'd Ju&s;t, which are e&s;tabli&s;h'd by the con&s;ent of Na|tions. The&s;e Nations may at the fir&s;t &s;et up popular or mix'd Govern|ments, and without the guilt of Sedition introduce them afterwards, if that which was fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h'd prove unprofitable or hurtful to them; and tho&s;e that have done &s;o, have enjoy'd more Ju&s;tice in times of Peace, and managed Wars, when occa&s;ion requir'd, with more vertue and bet|ter &s;ucce&s;s, than any Ab&s;olute Monarchys have done. And whereas he &s;ays, that <HI>in popular Governments each man has a care of his particular, and thinks ba&s;ely of the common Good; They look upon approaching Mi&s;chiefs as they do upon Thunder, only every man wi&s;hes it may not touch his own Per&s;on:</HI> I &s;ay, that men can no otherwi&s;e be engag'd to take care of the Publick, than by having &s;uch a part in it, as Ab&s;olute Monarchy dos not allow; for under it they can neither obtain the Good for them&s;elves, Po&s;terity and Friends, that they de&s;ire, nor prevent the Mi&s;chiefs they fear, which are the principal Arguments that per&s;uade men to expo&s;e them&s;elves to la|bours or dangers. 'Tis a folly to &s;ay, that the vigilance and wi&s;dom of the Monarch &s;upplies the defect of care in others; for we know that no men under the Sun were ever more void of both, and all manner of ver|tue requir'd to &s;uch a work, than very many Monarchs have bin: And, which is yet wor&s;e, the &s;trength and happine&s;s of the People being fre|quently dangerous to them, they have not &s;o much as the will to pro|mote it: nay, &s;ometimes &s;et them&s;elves to de&s;troy it. Antient Monar|chys afford us frequent examples of this kind; and if we con&s;ider tho&s;e of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Turky,</HI> which &s;eem mo&s;t to flouri&s;h in our Age, the People will appear to be &s;o mi&s;erable under both, that they cannot fear any change of Governor or Government; and all, except a few Mini&s;ters, are kept &s;o far from the knowledg of, or power in the management of Affairs, that if any of them &s;hould fancy a po&s;&s;ibility of &s;omething that might befal them wor&s;e than what they &s;uffer, or hope for that which might allevi|ate their mi&s;ery, they could do nothing towards the advancement of the one, or prevention of the other. <HI>Tacitus</HI> ob&s;erves, that in his time no man was able to write what pa&s;t, <HI>In&s;citia Reipublicae ut alienae.</HI> They <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tacit. An. l. 1.</NOTE>neglected the publick Affairs in which they had no part. In the &s;ame Age it was &s;aid, that the People, who whil&s;t they fought for their own Intere&s;ts had bin invincible, being en&s;lav'd, were grown &s;ordid, idle, ba&s;e, running after Stage-plays and Shows; &s;o as the whole &s;trength of the <HI>Roman</HI> Armys con&s;i&s;ted of Strangers. When their Spirits were de|pre&s;t by &s;ervitude, they had neither courage to defend them&s;elves, nor will to fight for their wicked Ma&s;ters; and lea&s;t of all to increa&s;e their Power, which was de&s;tructive to them&s;elves. The &s;ame thing is found in all places. Tho the <HI>Turk</HI> commands many va&s;t Provinces, that natu|rally produce as good Soldiers as any, yet his greate&s;t &s;trength is in Chil|dren that do not know their Fathers; who not being very many in num|ber, may peri&s;h in one Battel, and the Empire by that means be lo&s;t, the mi&s;erable Nations that groan under that Tyranny having neither courage,
<PB N="138" REF="146">
  power, nor will to defend it. This was the fate of the <HI>Mamalukes.</HI> They had for the &s;pace of almo&s;t two hundred years domineer'd in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and a great part of <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> but the people under them being weak and di&s;af|fected, they could never recover the Defeat they received from <HI>Selim</HI> near <HI>Tripoli,</HI> who pur&s;uing his Victory, in a few months utterly aboli&s;h'd their Kingdom.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the pre&s;ent Pride of <HI>France,</HI> the numbers and war|like Inclinations of that People, the bravery of the Nobility, extent of Dominion, convenience of Situation, and the va&s;t Revenues of their King, his greate&s;t Advantages have bin gain'd by the mi&s;taken Coun&s;els of <HI>England,</HI> the valor of our Soldiers unhappily &s;ent to &s;erve him, and the Strangers of whom the &s;trength of his Armys con&s;i&s;ts; which is &s;o un&s;teddy a &s;upport, that many who are well vers'd in Affairs of this na|ture, incline to think he &s;ub&s;i&s;ts rather by little Arts, and corrupting Mi|ni&s;ters in Foreign Courts, than by the Power of his own Armys; and that &s;ome reformation in the Coun&s;els of his Neighbours might prove &s;ufficient to overthrow that Greatne&s;s which is grown formidable to <HI>Eu|rope;</HI> the &s;ame mi&s;ery to which he has reduc'd his People, rendring them as unable to defend him, upon any change of Fortune, as to defend their own Rights again&s;t him.</P>
<P>This proceeds not from any particular defect in the <HI>French</HI> Government, but that which is common to all Ab&s;olute Monarchys. And no State can be &s;aid to &s;tand upon a &s;teddy Foundation, except tho&s;e who&s;e &s;trength is in their own Soldiery, and the body of their own People. Such as &s;erve for Wages, often betray their Ma&s;ters in di&s;tre&s;s, and always want the courage and indu&s;try which is found in tho&s;e who fight for their own Intere&s;ts, and are to have a part in the Victory. The bu&s;ine&s;s of Mer|cenarys is &s;o to perform their duty as to keep their Employments, and to draw profit from them; but that is not enough to &s;upport the Spirits of men in extreme dangers. The Shepherd who is a hireling, flies when the Thief comes; and this adventitious help failing, all that a Prince can rea&s;onably expect from a di&s;affected and oppre&s;t People is, that they &s;hould bear the Yoke patiently in the time of his Pro&s;perity; but upon the change of his Fortune they leave him to &s;hift for him&s;elf, or join with his Enemys to avenge the Injurys they had receiv'd. Thus did <HI>Al|phon&s;o</HI> and <HI>Ferdinand</HI> Kings of <HI>Naples,</HI> and <HI>Lodovico Sforza</HI> Duke of <HI>Mi|lan</HI> fall in the times of <HI>Charles</HI> the Eighth and <HI>Louis</HI> the Twelfth, Kings of <HI>France.</HI> The two fir&s;t had bin fal&s;e, violent, and cruel; nothing within their Kingdom could oppo&s;e their fury: but when they were in|vaded by a foreign Power, they lo&s;t all, as <HI>Guicciardin</HI> &s;ays, without breaking one Lance; and <HI>Sforza</HI> was by his own mercenary Soldiers de|liver'd into the hands of his Enemys.</P>
<P>I think it may be hard to find Examples of &s;uch as proceeding in the &s;ame way have had better Succe&s;s: But if it &s;hould &s;o fall out, that a Peo|ple living under an Ab&s;olute Monarchy, &s;hould thro cu&s;tom, or fear of &s;omething wor&s;e (if that can be) not only &s;uffer patiently, but de&s;ire to uphold the Government; neither the Nobility, nor Commonalty can do any thing towards it. They are &s;trangers to all publick Concern|ments: All things are govern'd by one, or a &s;ew men, and others know nothing either of Action or Coun&s;el. <HI>Filmer</HI> will tell us 'tis no matter; the profound Wi&s;dom of the Prince provides for all. But what if this Prince be a Child, a Fool, a &s;uperannuated Dotard, or a Madman? Or if he dos not fall under any of the&s;e extremitys, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;uch a
<PB N="139" REF="147">
proportion of Wit, Indu&s;try, and Courage as is ordinarily &s;een in men,   how &s;hall he &s;upply the Office that indeed requires profound Wi&s;dom, and an equal mea&s;ure of Experience and Valor? 'Tis to no purpo&s;e to &s;ay a good Council may &s;upply his defects; for it dos not appear how he &s;hould come by this Council, nor who &s;hould oblige him to follow their advice: If he be left to his own will to do what he plea&s;es, tho good advice be given to him; yet his judgment being perverted, he will always incline to the wor&s;t: If a nece&s;&s;ity be impos'd upon him of act|ing according to the advice of his Council, he is not that ab&s;olute Mo|narch of whom we &s;peak, nor the Government Monarchical, but Ari|&s;tocratical. The&s;e are imperfect Figleave coverings of Nakedne&s;s. It was in vain to give good Coun&s;el to <HI>Sardanapalus;</HI> and none could defend the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI> Empire, when he lay wallowing among&s;t his Whores, with|out any other thought than of his Lu&s;ts. None could pre&s;erve <HI>Rome,</HI> when <HI>Domitian</HI>'s chief bu&s;ine&s;s was to kill Flies, and that of <HI>Honorius</HI> to take care of his Hens. The Monarchy of <HI>France</HI> mu&s;t have peri&s;h'd under the ba&s;e Kings they call <HI>Les Roys faineants,</HI> if the Scepter had not bin wre&s;ted out of their unworthy hands. The World is full of Exam|ples in this kind: and when it plea&s;es God to be&s;tow a ju&s;t, wi&s;e, and valiant King as a ble&s;&s;ing upon a Nation, 'tis only a momentary help, his Vertues end with him; and there being neither any divine Promi&s;e nor human Rea&s;on, moving us to believe that they &s;hall always be renew'd and continu'd in his Succe&s;&s;ors, men cannot rely upon it; and to alledg a po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch a thing is nothing to the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide, in a popular or mix'd Government every man is concern'd: Every one has a part according to his quality or merit; all changes are prejudicial to all: What&s;oever any man conceives to be for the publick good, he may propo&s;e it in the Magi&s;tracy, or to the Ma|gi&s;trate: The body of the People is the publick defence, and every man is arm'd and di&s;ciplin'd: the advantages of good &s;ucce&s;s are communi|cated to all, and every one bears a part in the lo&s;&s;es. This makes men generous and indu&s;trious, and fills their hearts with Love to their Coun|try: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Amor patriae, laudi&s;que immen&s;a cupido. <BIBL>Virg.</BIBL></NOTE>This, and the de&s;ire of that prai&s;e which is the Reward of Vertue, rais'd the <HI>Romans</HI> above the re&s;t of Mankind; and where&s;oever the &s;ame ways are taken, they will in a great mea&s;ure have the &s;ame effects. By this means they had as many Soldiers to fight for their Country as there were Freemen in it. Whil&s;t they had to deal with the free Nations of <HI>Italy, Greece, Africa</HI> or <HI>Spain,</HI> they never conquer'd a Country, till the Inhabitants were exhau&s;ted: But when they came to fight again&s;t Kings, the &s;ucce&s;s of a Battel was enough to bring a Kingdom under their power. <HI>Antiochus</HI> upon a ruffle receiv'd from <HI>Acilius</HI> at <HI>Thermopylae,</HI> left all that he po&s;&s;e&s;t in <HI>Greece;</HI> and being defeated by <HI>Scipio Na&s;ica,</HI> he quitted all the Kingdoms and Territorys of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> on this &s;ide <HI>Taurus. Paulus Emilius</HI> became Ma&s;ter of <HI>Macedon</HI> by one pro&s;perous fight again&s;t <HI>Per&s;es. Sy|phax, Gentius, Tigranes, Ptolomy,</HI> and others, were more ea&s;ily &s;ubdu'd. The mercenary Armys on which they rely'd being broken, the Citys and Countrys not caring for their Ma&s;ters, &s;ubmitted to tho&s;e who had more vertue, and better fortune. If the <HI>Roman</HI> Power had not bin built upon a more &s;ure foundation, they could not have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted. Notwith|&s;tanding their Valor, they were often beaten; but their lo&s;&s;es were imme|diately
<PB N="140" REF="148">
  repair'd by the excellence of their Di&s;ciplin. When <HI>Hannibal</HI> had gain'd the Battels of <HI>Trebia, Ticinum, Thra&s;imene,</HI> and <HI>Cannae;</HI> defeated the <HI>Romans</HI> in many other Encounters, and &s;lain above two hundred thou&s;and of their Men, with <HI>Paulus Emilius, C. Servilius, Sempronius Gracchus, Quintius, Marcellus,</HI> and many other excellent Commanders: When about the &s;ame time the two brave <HI>Scipio</HI>'s had bin cut off with their Armys in <HI>Spain,</HI> and many great Lo&s;&s;es had bin &s;u&s;tain'd in <HI>Sicily</HI> and by Sea, one would have thought it impo&s;&s;ible for the City to have re&s;i&s;ted: But their Vertue, love to their Country, and good Government was a &s;trength that increas'd under all their Calamitys, and in the end overcame all. The nearer <HI>Hannibal</HI> came to the Walls, the more ob&s;ti|nate was their re&s;i&s;tance. Tho he had kill'd more great Captains than any Kingdom ever had, others daily &s;tep'd up in their place, who excel'd them in all manner of Vertue. I know not, if at any time that con|quering City could glory in a greater number of men fit for the highe&s;t En|terpri&s;es, than at the end of that cruel War, which had con&s;um'd &s;o ma|ny of them; but I think that the fini&s;hing Victorys by them obtain'd, are but ill proofs of our Author's a&s;&s;ertion, that they <HI>thought ba&s;ely of the common Good, and &s;ought only to &s;ave them&s;elves.</HI> We know of none ex|cept <HI>Cecilius Metellus,</HI> who after the Battel of <HI>Cannae</HI> had &s;o ba&s;e a thought as to de&s;ign the withdrawing him&s;elf from the publick ruin; but <HI>Scipio</HI> (afterwards &s;irnam'd <HI>Africanus)</HI> threatning death to tho&s;e who would not &s;wear never to abandon their Country, forc'd him to leave it. This may in general be imputed to good Government and Di&s;ciplin, with which all were &s;o &s;ea&s;on'd from their infancy, that no affection was &s;o rooted in them, as an ardent love to their Country, and a re&s;olution to die for it, or with it; but the means by which they accompli&s;h'd their great Ends, &s;o as after their defeats to have &s;uch men as carry'd on their noble&s;t De&s;igns with more glory than ever, was their annual Elections of Magi&s;trats, many being thereby advanc'd to the &s;upreme Commands, and every one by the Honors he enjoy'd, fill'd with a de&s;ire of rendring him|&s;elf worthy of them.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not much in&s;i&s;t upon the&s;e things, if they had bin &s;een only in <HI>Rome:</HI> but tho their Di&s;ciplin &s;eems to have bin more perfect, better ob&s;erv'd, and to have produc'd a Vertue that &s;urpa&s;t all others; the like has bin found, tho perhaps not in the &s;ame degree, in all Nations that have enjoy'd their Liberty, and were admitted to &s;uch a part of the Go|vernment, as might give them a love to it. This was evident in all the Nations of <HI>Italy.</HI> The <HI>Sabins, Vol&s;ci, Aequi, Tu&s;cans, Samnites</HI> and o|thers, were never conquer'd, till they had no men left. The <HI>Samnites</HI> alone inhabiting a &s;mall and barren Province, &s;uffer'd more defeats before they were &s;ubdu'd, than all the Kingdoms of <HI>Numidia, Aegypt, Mace|don,</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> and, as 'tis expre&s;t in their Emba&s;&s;y to <HI>Hannibal,</HI> never yielded, till they who had brought va&s;t numbers of men into the Field, and by them defeated &s;ome of the <HI>Roman</HI> Armys, were reduc'd to &s;uch weakne&s;s, that they could not re&s;i&s;t one Legion. We hear of &s;ew <HI>Spar|tans</HI> who did not willingly expo&s;e their Lives for the &s;ervice of their Country; and the Women them&s;elves were &s;o far inflam'd with the &s;ame affection, that they refus'd to mourn for their Children and Husbands who dy'd in the defence of it. When the brave <HI>Bra&s;idas</HI> was &s;lain, &s;ome eminent men went to comfort his Mother upon the news of his death; and telling her he was the mo&s;t valiant man in the City, &s;he <NOTE PLACE="marg">Thucyd. de Bell. Pelopon.</NOTE>an&s;wer'd, that he was indeed a valiant man, and dy'd as he ought to do,
<PB N="141" REF="149">
but that thro the goodne&s;s of the Gods, many others were left as valiant   as he.</P>
<P>When <HI>Xerxes</HI> invaded <HI>Greece,</HI> there was not a Citizen of <HI>Athens</HI> able to bear Arms, who did not leave his Wife and Children to &s;hift for them|&s;elves in the neighbouring Citys, and their Hou&s;es to be burnt when they imbark'd with <HI>Themi&s;tocles;</HI> and never thought of either till they had de|feated the <HI>Barbarians</HI> at <HI>Salamis</HI> by Sea, and at <HI>Platea</HI> by Land. When men are thus &s;pirited, &s;ome will ever prove excellent: and as none did ever &s;ur|pa&s;s tho&s;e who are bred under this di&s;ciplin in all moral, military and civil Vertues; tho&s;e very Countrys where they flouri&s;h'd mo&s;t, have not pro|duc'd any eminent men &s;ince they lo&s;t that Liberty which was the Mo|ther and Nur&s;e of them.</P>
<P>Tho I &s;hould fill a Volume with examples of this kind (as I might ea|&s;ily do) &s;uch as our Author will &s;ay, that in Popular Governments men look upon Mi&s;chiefs as Thunder, and only wi&s;h it may not touch them|&s;elves: But leaving them to the &s;corn and hatred they de&s;erve by their impudence and folly, I conclude this point with the an&s;wer, that <HI>Trajano</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ragion. 99.</NOTE><HI>Boccalini</HI> puts into the mouth of <HI>Apollo,</HI> to the Princes who complain'd that their Subjects had not that love to their Countrys, as had bin, and was daily &s;een in tho&s;e who liv'd under Commonwealths; which amounted to no more than to tell them, that their ill Government was the cau&s;e of that defect, and that the prejudices incur'd by Rapine, Violence, and Fraud, were to be repair'd only by Liberality, Ju&s;tice, and &s;uch a care of their Subjects, that they might live happily under them.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXII. Commonwealths &s;eek Peace or War according to the Variety of their Con&s;titutions.</HEAD>
<P>IF I have hitherto &s;poken in general of popular or mix'd Govern|ments, as if they were all founded on the &s;ame principle, it was only becau&s;e our Author without di&s;tinction has generally blam'd them all, and generally imputed to every one tho&s;e Faults, which perhaps never were many; but mo&s;t certainly are directly oppo&s;ite to the temper and con&s;titu|tion of many among them. Malice and Ignorance reign &s;o equally in him, that 'tis not ea&s;y to determin from which of the two this fal&s;e repre|&s;entation proceeds. But le&s;t any man &s;hould thereby be impos'd upon, 'tis time to ob&s;erve, That the Con&s;titutions of Commonwealths have bin &s;o various, according to the different temper of Nations and Times, that if &s;ome of them &s;eem to have bin principally con&s;tituted for War, others have as much delighted in Peace; and many having taken the middle, and (as &s;ome think) the be&s;t way, have &s;o moderated their love to Peace, as not to &s;uffer the Spirits of the People to fall, but kept them in a perpe|tual readine&s;s to make War when there was occa&s;ion: and every one of tho&s;e having follow'd &s;everal ways and ends, de&s;erve our particular con&s;i|deration.</P>
<P>The Citys of <HI>Rome, Sparta, Thebes,</HI> and all the A&s;&s;ociations of the <HI>Eto|lians, Achaians, Sabins, Latins, Samnites,</HI> and many others that antient|ly flouri&s;h'd in <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> &s;eem to have intended nothing but the ju&s;t pre&s;ervation of Liberty at home, and making War abroad. All the Na|tions
<PB N="142" REF="150">
  of <HI>Spain, Germany,</HI> and <HI>Gaul</HI> &s;ought the &s;ame things. Their prin|cipal work was to render their People valiant, obedient to their Com|manders, lovers of their Country, and always ready to fight for it: And for this rea&s;on when the Senators of <HI>Rome</HI> had kill'd <HI>Romulus,</HI> they per|&s;uaded <HI>Julius Proculus</HI> to affirm, that he had &s;een him in a mo&s;t glorious form a&s;cending to Heaven, and promi&s;ing great things to the City, <HI>Proinde rem militarem colant.</HI> The <HI>Athenians</HI> were not le&s;s inclin'd to War, but apply'd them&s;elves to Trade, as &s;ub&s;ervient to that end, by increa&s;ing the number of the People, and furni&s;hing them with the means of carrying it on with more vigor and power. The <HI>Phenician</HI> Citys, of which <HI>Car|thage</HI> was the mo&s;t eminent, follow'd the &s;ame method; but knowing that Riches do not defend them&s;elves, or &s;corning &s;lothfully to enjoy what was gain'd by Commerce, they &s;o far apply'd them&s;elves to War, that they grew to a Power, which <HI>Rome</HI> only was able to overthrow. <HI>Ve|nice, Florence, Genoa, Lucca,</HI> and &s;ome other Citys of <HI>Italy</HI> &s;eem chiefly to have aim'd at Trade; and placing the hopes of their &s;afety in the pro|tection of more powerful States, have unwillingly enter'd into Wars, e&s;pecially by Land; and when they did, they made them by mercenary Soldiers.</P>
<P>Again, &s;ome of tho&s;e that intended War de&s;ir'd to enlarge their Terri|torys by conque&s;t; others only to pre&s;erve their own, and to live with freedom and &s;afety upon them. <HI>Rome</HI> was of the fir&s;t &s;ort; and know|ing that &s;uch ends cannot be accompli&s;h'd without great numbers of men, they freely admitted Strangers into the City, Senat, and Magi&s;tracy. <HI>Nu|ma</HI> was a <HI>Sabin: Tarquinius Pri&s;cus</HI> was the Son of a <HI>Grecian:</HI> One hundred of tho&s;e <HI>Sabins</HI> who came with <HI>Tatius</HI> were admitted into the Senat: <HI>Appi|us Claudius</HI> of the &s;ame People came to <HI>Rome,</HI> was made a Member of the Senat, and created Con&s;ul. They demoli&s;h'd &s;everal Citys, and brought the Inhabitants to their own; gave the right of Citizens to many others (&s;ome|times to whole Citys and Provinces) and car'd not how many they re|ceiv'd, &s;o they could engraft them upon the &s;ame intere&s;t with the old &s;tock, and &s;ea&s;on them with the &s;ame Principles, Di&s;ciplin, and Man|ners. On the other &s;ide, the <HI>Spartans</HI> de&s;iring only to continue free, ver|tuous, and &s;afe in the enjoyment of their own Territory; and thinking them&s;elves &s;trong enough to defend it, fram'd a mo&s;t &s;evere Di&s;ciplin, to which few Strangers would &s;ubmit. They bani&s;h'd all tho&s;e curious Arts, that are u&s;eful to Trade; prohibited the importation of Gold and Silver; appointed the <HI>Helotes</HI> to cultivate their Lands, and to exerci&s;e &s;uch Trades as are nece&s;&s;ary to life; admitted few Strangers to live among&s;t them; made none of them free of their City, and educated their Youth in &s;uch exer|ci&s;es only as prepar'd them for War. I will not take upon me to judg whether this proceeded from &s;uch a moderation of Spirit, as plac'd Felicity rather in the fulne&s;s and &s;tability of Liberty, Integrity, Vertue, and the enjoyment of their own, than in Riches, Power, and Dominion over others; nor which of the&s;e two different methods de&s;erves mo&s;t to be commended: But certain it is that both &s;ucceeded according to the inten|tion of the Founders.</P>
<P><HI>Rome</HI> conquer'd the be&s;t part of the World, and never wanted men to defend what was gain'd: <HI>Sparta</HI> liv'd in &s;uch happine&s;s and reputation, that till it was invaded by <HI>Epimanondas,</HI> an Enemys Trumpet had not bin heard by tho&s;e within the Town for the &s;pace of eight hundred years, and never &s;uffer'd any great di&s;a&s;ter, till receding from their own In&s;titu|tions, they were brought by pro&s;perity to affect the principality of <HI>Greece,</HI>
<PB N="143" REF="151">
and to undertake &s;uch Wars as could not be carry'd on without Mony,   and greater numbers of men than a &s;mall City was able to furni&s;h; by which means they were oblig'd to beg a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Barba|rians, whom they &s;corn'd and hated, as appears by the Storys of <HI>Callicra|tidas, Ly&s;ander,</HI> and <HI>Age&s;ilaus,</HI> and fell into &s;uch &s;traits as were never re|cover'd.</P>
<P>The like variety has bin ob&s;erv'd in the Con&s;titutions of tho&s;e Nor|thern Nations that invaded the Roman Empire: for tho all of them in|tended War, and look'd upon tho&s;e only to be Members of their Com|monwealths who us'd arms to defend them, yet &s;ome did immediately incorporate them&s;elves with tho&s;e of the conquer'd Countrys. Of this number were the <HI>Franks,</HI> who pre&s;ently became one Nation with the <HI>Gauls;</HI> others kept them&s;elves in a di&s;tinct Body, as the <HI>Saxons</HI> did from the <HI>Britains:</HI> And the <HI>Goths</HI> for more than three hundred years that they reign'd in <HI>Spain,</HI> never contracted Marriages, or otherwi&s;e mix'd with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> till their Kingdom was overthrown by the <HI>Moors.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e things, and others of the like nature, being weigh'd, many have doubted whether it were better to con&s;titute a Commonwealth for War or for Trade; and of &s;uch as intend War, whether tho&s;e are mo&s;t to be prais'd who prepare for defence only, or tho&s;e who de&s;ign by con|que&s;t to enlarge their Dominions. Or, if they admit of Trade, whe|ther they &s;hould propo&s;e the acqui&s;ition of Riches for their ultimate end, and depend upon foreign or mercenary Forces to defend them; or to be as helps to enable their own People to carry on tho&s;e Wars in which they may be frequently engag'd. The&s;e Que&s;tions might perhaps be ea&s;ily decid|ed, if Mankind were of a temper to &s;uffer tho&s;e to live in peace, who of|fer no injury to any; or that men who have Mony to hire Soldiers when they &s;tand in need of them, could find &s;uch as would valiantly and faith|fully defend them, whil&s;t they apply them&s;elves to their Trades. But experience teaching us that tho&s;e only can be &s;afe who are &s;trong; and that no People was ever well defended but tho&s;e who fought for them&s;elves; the be&s;t Judges of the&s;e matters have always given the preference to tho&s;e Con&s;titutions that principally intend War, and make u&s;e of Trade as a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing to that end: and think it better to aim at conque&s;t, rather than &s;im|ply to &s;tand upon their own defence; &s;ince he that lo&s;es all if he be over|come, &s;ights upon very unequal terms; and if he obtain the Victory, gains no other advantage, than for the pre&s;ent to repel the danger that threaten'd him.</P>
<P>The&s;e Opinions are confirm'd by the examples of the <HI>Romans,</HI> who pro&s;per'd much more than the <HI>Spartans:</HI> And the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> who made u&s;e of Trade as a help to War, rais'd their City to be one of the mo&s;t potent that ever was in the World: Whereas the <HI>Venetians</HI> having rely'd on Trade and mercenary Soldiers, are always forc'd too much to depend upon foreign Potentats; very often to buy Peace with ignomi|nious and prejudicial conditions; and &s;ometimes to fear the infidelity of their own Commanders, no le&s;s than the violence of their Enemys. But that which ought to be valu'd above all in point of Wi&s;dom as well as Ju&s;tice, is the Government given by God to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> which chiefly fitted them for War, and to make Conque&s;ts. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> divided them un|der &s;everal Captains, into thou&s;ands, hundreds, fiftys, and tens: This was a perpetual Ordinance among&s;t them: In numbring them, tho&s;e only were counted, who were able to bear arms: Every man was oblig'd to go out to War, except &s;uch as had marry'd a Wife, or upon other
<PB N="144" REF="152">
  &s;pecial occa&s;ions were for a time excus'd; and the whole &s;eries of the &s;a|cred Hi&s;tory &s;hews that there were always as many Soldiers to fight for their Country as there were men able to fight. And if this be taken for a Picture of a many-headed Bea&s;t delighting in Blood, begotten by Sedi|tion, and nouri&s;h'd by Crimes, God him&s;elf was the drawer of it.</P>
<P>In this variety of Con&s;titutions, and Effects proceeding from them, I can &s;ee nothing more ju&s;tly and generally to be attributed to them all, than that Love to their Country, which our Author impudently affirms to be wanting in all. In other matters their proceedings are not only diffe|rent, but contrary to each other: yet it cannot be &s;aid that any Nations have injoy'd &s;o much Peace as &s;ome Republicks. The <HI>Venetians</HI> too great inclination to Peace is accounted to be a mortal error in their Con&s;titu|tion; and they have not bin le&s;s free from dome&s;tick Seditions than fo|reign Wars: the Con&s;piracys of the <HI>Falerii</HI> and <HI>Tiepoli</HI> were extingui&s;h'd by their puni&s;hment, and that of <HI>La Cueva</HI> cru&s;h'd before it was ripe. <HI>Genoa</HI> has not bin altogether &s;o happy: the factions of the <HI>Guelphs</HI> and <HI>Ghibelins</HI> that &s;pread them&s;elves over all <HI>Italy,</HI> infected that City; and the malice of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>French</HI> rais'd others under the <HI>Frego&s;i</HI> and <HI>Adorni;</HI> but they being compos'd, they have for more than a hundred and fifty years re&s;ted in quiet.</P>
<P>There is another &s;ort of Commonwealth compos'd of many Citys a&s;|&s;ociated together, and living <HI>aequo jure;</HI> every one retaining and exerci|&s;ing a Sovereign Power within it &s;elf, except in &s;ome ca&s;es expre&s;t in the Act of Union, or League made between them. The&s;e I confe&s;s are more hardly pre&s;erv'd in Peace. Di&s;putes may ari&s;e among them concerning Limits, Juri&s;diction, and the like. They cannot always be equally con|cern'd in the &s;ame things. The injurys offer'd to one do not equally af|fect all. Their Neighbors will &s;ow Divi&s;ions among them; and not having a Mother-City to decide their Controver&s;ys by her authority, they may be apt to fall into quarrels, e&s;pecially if they profe&s;s Chri&s;tianity; which having bin &s;plit into variety of opinions ever &s;ince it was preach'd, and the Papi&s;ts by their cruelty to &s;uch as di&s;&s;ent from them, &s;hewing to all, that there is no other way of defending them&s;elves again&s;t them, than by u&s;ing the &s;ame, almo&s;t every man is come to think he ought (as far as in him lies) to impo&s;e his belief on others, and that he can give no better te&s;timony of his Zeal, than the exce&s;s of his violence on that account. Neverthele&s;s the Cantons of the <HI>Switzers,</HI> tho accompany'd with all the mo&s;t dangerous circum&s;tances that can be imagin'd, being thirteen in number, independent on each other, govern'd in a high degree popular|ly, profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tianity differing in mo&s;t important points; eight of them much influenc'd by the Je&s;uits, and perpetually excited to War a|gain&s;t their Brethren by the powerful Crowns of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> have ever &s;ince they ca&s;t off the in&s;upportable Yoke of the Earls of <HI>Hap&s;|burg,</HI> enjoy'd more peace than any other State of <HI>Europe,</HI> and from the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable people, are grown to &s;uch a Power, that the greate&s;t Monarchs do mo&s;t &s;ollicitou&s;ly &s;eek their Friend&s;hip; and none have dar'd to invade them, &s;ince <HI>Charles</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> did it to his ruin: and he who for a long time had bin a terror to the great, dangerous, and &s;ub|til King of <HI>France,</HI> gave by the lo&s;s of three Armys and his own life, a la&s;ting te&s;timony of his temerity in a&s;&s;aulting a free and valiant, tho a poor people, fighting in their own quarrel. <HI>Commines</HI> well relates that War; but a va&s;t heap of Bones remaining to this day at <HI>Muret</HI> with this in&s;cription, <HI>Caroli forti&s;&s;imi Burgundiorum Ducis exercitus Muretum ob|&s;idens</HI>

No Government was ever more free from popular Sedi|tions; the revolts of their Subjects have bin few, weak, and ea&s;ily &s;up|pre&s;t; the di&s;&s;en&s;ion rais'd by the Je&s;uits between the Cantons of <HI>Zurich</HI> and <HI>Lucern</HI> was as &s;oon compos'd as the rebellion of the County of <HI>Vaux</HI> again&s;t the Canton of <HI>Bern;</HI> and tho&s;e few of the like nature that have happen'd among them have had the like &s;ucce&s;s: So that <HI>Thuanus</HI> in the Hi&s;tory of his time, comprehending about fifty years, and relating the horrid dome&s;tick and foreign Wars, that di&s;tracted <HI>Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Flanders, England, Scotland, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, Hungary, Tran&s;ilvania, Mu&s;covy, Turky, Africk,</HI> and other places, has no more to &s;ay of them than to &s;hew what Arts had bin in vain us'd to di&s;turb their &s;o much envy'd quiet. But if the mode&s;t temper of the People, together with the Wi&s;dom, Ju&s;tice, and Strength of their Go|vernment, could not be di&s;compos'd by the mea&s;ures of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> by the indu&s;try of their Emba&s;&s;adors, or the malicious craft of the Je&s;u|its, we may &s;afely conclude that their State is as well &s;ettled as any thing among men can be, and can hardly comprehend what is like to interrupt it. As much might be &s;aid of the Citys of the <HI>Han&s;eatick</HI> Society, if they had an intire Sovereignty in them&s;elves: But the Citys of the United Provinces in the Low Countrys being every one of them Sovereign with|in them&s;elves, and many in number, &s;till continuing in their Union in &s;pite of all the endeavours that have bin us'd to divide them, give us an example of &s;uch &s;teddine&s;s in practice and principle, as is hardly to be pa|rallel'd in the world, and that undeniably prove a temper in their Con|&s;titutions directly oppo&s;ite to that which our Author imputes to all popu|lar Governments: and if the Death of <HI>Barnevelt</HI> and <HI>De Wit,</HI> or the pre|&s;erment of &s;ome mo&s;t unlike to them, be taken for a te&s;timony that the be&s;t men thrive wor&s;t, and the wor&s;t be&s;t, I hope it may be con&s;ider'd that tho&s;e Violences proceeded from that which is mo&s;t contrary to Popu|larity, tho I am not very willing to explain it.</P>
<P>If the&s;e matters are not clear in them&s;elves, I de&s;ire they may be com|par'd with what has happen'd between any Princes that from the begin|ning of the world have bin join'd in League to each other, whether they were of the &s;ame or of different Nations. Let an example be brought of &s;ix, thirteen, or more Princes or Kings who enter'd into a League; and for the &s;pace of one or more Ages, did neither break it, nor quarrel upon the explication of it. Let the States of the <HI>Switzers, Gri&s;ons,</HI> or <HI>Hollanders,</HI> be compar'd with that of <HI>France,</HI> when it was &s;ometimes divided between two, three, or four Brothers of <HI>Meroveus</HI> or <HI>Pepin</HI>'s Races; with the Heptarchy of <HI>England;</HI> the Kingdoms of <HI>Leon, Arra|gon, Navarr, Ca&s;tile</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> under which the Chri&s;tians in <HI>Spain</HI> were divided; or tho&s;e of <HI>Cordoua, Sevil, Malaga, Granada,</HI> and others under the Power of the <HI>Moors:</HI> and if it be not evident, that the popu|lar States have bin remarkable for Peace among them&s;elves, con&s;tancy to their Union, and Fidelity to the Leagues made with their A&s;&s;ociats; whereas all the abovemention'd Kingdoms, and &s;uch others as are known among men to have bin join'd in the like Leagues, were ever infe&s;ted with dome&s;tick Rebellions and Quarrels ari&s;ing from the Ambition of Princes,
<PB N="146" REF="154">
  &s;o as no Confederacy could be &s;o cautiou&s;ly made, but they would find ways to elude it, or &s;o &s;olemn and &s;acred, but they would in far le&s;s time break thro it: I will confe&s;s, that Kingdoms have &s;ometimes bin as free from civil di&s;turbances; and that Leagues made between &s;everal Princes, have bin as con&s;tantly and religiou&s;ly ob&s;erv'd, as by Commonwealths. But if no &s;uch thing dos appear in the World, and no man who is not impudent or ignorant dare pretend it, I may ju&s;tly conclude, that tho every Commonwealth has its Action &s;utable to its Con&s;titution, and that many a&s;&s;ociated together are not &s;o free from di&s;turbances, as tho&s;e that wholly depend upon the Authority of a Mother City; yet we know of none that have not bin, and are more regular and quiet than any Princi|palitys; and as to Foreign Wars, they &s;eek or avoid them according to their various Con&s;titutions.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXIII. That is the be&s;t Government, which be&s;t provides for War.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author having huddled up all popular and mix'd Governments into one, has in &s;ome mea&s;ure forc'd me to explain the various Con|&s;titutions and Principles upon which they are grounded: But as the wi&s;|dom of a Father is &s;een, not only in providing Bread for his Family, or increa&s;ing his Patrimonial E&s;tate, but in making all po&s;&s;ible provi&s;ion for the &s;ecurity of it; &s;o that Government is evidently the be&s;t, which, not relying upon what it dos at fir&s;t enjoy, &s;eeks to increa&s;e the number, &s;trength, and riches of the People; and by the be&s;t Di&s;ciplin to bring the Power &s;o improv'd into &s;uch order as may be of mo&s;t u&s;e to the Pub|lick. This comprehends all things conducing to the admini&s;tration of Ju|&s;tice, the pre&s;ervation of dome&s;tick Peace, and the increa&s;e of Com|merce, that the People being pleas'd with their pre&s;ent condition, may be fill'd with love to their Country, encourag'd to fight boldly for the publick Cau&s;e, which is their own; and as men do willingly join with that which pro&s;pers, that Strangers may be invited to fix their Habita|tions in &s;uch a City, and to e&s;pou&s;e the principles that reign in it. This is nece&s;&s;ary for &s;everal rea&s;ons; but I &s;hall principally in&s;i&s;t upon one, which is, that all things in their beginning are weak: The Whelp of a Lion newly born has neither &s;trength nor fiercene&s;s. He that builds a Ci|ty, and dos not intend it &s;hould increa&s;e, commits as great an ab&s;urdity, as if he &s;hould de&s;ire his Child might ever continue under the &s;ame weak|ne&s;s in which he is born. If it dos not grow, it mu&s;t pine and peri&s;h; for in this World nothing is permanent: that which dos not grow better will grow wor&s;e. This increa&s;e al&s;o is u&s;ele&s;s, or perhaps hurtful, if it be not in Strength, as well as in Riches or Number; for every one is apt to &s;eize upon ill-guarded Trea&s;ures: and the terror that the City of <HI>Lon|don</HI> was po&s;&s;e&s;t with, when a few Dutch Ships came to <HI>Chatham,</HI> &s;hews that no numbers of men, tho naturally valiant, are able to defend them|&s;elves, unle&s;s they be well arm'd, di&s;ciplin'd and conducted. Their Mul|titude brings confu&s;ion: their Wealth, when 'tis like to be made a prey, increa&s;es the fears of the owners; and they, who if they were brought into good order, might conquer a great part of the World, being de&s;ti|tute of it, dur&s;t not think of defending them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="155">
If it be &s;aid that the wi&s;e Father mention'd by me endeavours to &s;ecure   his Patrimony by Law, not by Force; I an&s;wer, that all defence termi|nates in force; and if a private man dos not prepare to defend his E&s;tate with his own Force, 'tis becau&s;e he lives under the protection of the Law, and expects the force of the Magi&s;trate &s;hould be a &s;ecurity to him: but Kingdoms and Commonwealths acknowledging no Superior, except God alone, can rea&s;onably hope to be protected by him only; and by him, if with indu&s;try and courage they make u&s;e of the means he has given them for their own defence. God helps tho&s;e who help them&s;elves; and men are by &s;everal rea&s;ons (&s;uppo&s;e to prevent the increa&s;e of a &s;u&s;pected Power) induc'd to &s;uccour an indu&s;trious and brave People: But &s;uch as neglect the means of their own pre&s;ervation, are ever left to peri&s;h with &s;hame. Men cannot rely upon any League: The State that is defended by one Potentat again&s;t another, becomes a Slave to their Pro|tector: Mercenary Soldiers always want Fidelity or Courage, and mo&s;t commonly both. If they are not corrupted or beaten by the Invader, they make a prey of their Ma&s;ters. The&s;e are the followers of Camps who have neither Faith nor Piety <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">&mdash;Ibi fas ubi maxima merces. <BIBL>Lucan.</BIBL></NOTE>but prefer Gain before Right. They who expo&s;e their Blood to &s;ale, look where they can make the be&s;t bargain, and never fail of pretences for following their intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>Moreover, private Familys may by &s;everal arts increa&s;e their Wealth, as they increa&s;e in number; but when a People multiplies (as they will always do in a good Climat under a good Government) &s;uch an enlarge|ment of Territory as is nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence can be acquir'd only by War. This was known to the Northern Nations that invaded the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire; but for want of &s;uch Con&s;titutions as might be&s;t im|prove their Strength and Valor, the numbers they &s;ent out when they were overburden'd, provided well for them&s;elves, but were of no u&s;e to the Countrys they left; and whil&s;t tho&s;e <HI>Goths, Vandals, Franks,</HI> and <HI>Normans</HI> enjoy'd the mo&s;t opulent and delicious Provinces of the World, their Fathers langui&s;h'd ob&s;curely in their frozen Climats. For the like rea&s;ons, or thro the &s;ame defect, the <HI>Switzers</HI> are oblig'd to &s;erve other Princes, and often to imploy that valor in advancing the power of their Neighbors, which might be us'd to increa&s;e their own. <HI>Genoua, Lucca, Geneva,</HI> and other &s;mall Commonwealths, having no Wars, are not able to nouri&s;h the men they breed; but &s;ending many of their Children to &s;eek their Fortunes abroad, &s;carce a third part of tho&s;e that are born a|mong them, die in tho&s;e Citys; and if they did not take this cour&s;e, they would have no better than the Nations inhabiting near the River <HI>Niger,</HI> who &s;ell their Children as the increa&s;e of their Flocks.</P>
<P>This dos not le&s;s concern Monarchys than Commonwealths; nor the ab&s;olute le&s;s than the mix'd: All of them have bin pro&s;perous or mi&s;era|ble, glorious or contemptible, as they were better or wor&s;e arm'd, di&s;ci|plin'd, or conducted. The <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI> Valor was irre&s;i&s;tible under <HI>Nabu|chodonozor;</HI> but was brought to nothing under his ba&s;e and luxurious Grand&s;on <HI>Bel&s;hazzar:</HI> The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> who under <HI>Cyrus</HI> conquer'd <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> were like Swine expos'd to &s;laughter when their Di&s;ciplin fail'd, and they were commanded by his proud, cruel, and cowardly Succe&s;&s;ors. The <HI>Mace|donian</HI> Army overthrown by <HI>Paulus Emilius</HI> was not le&s;s in number than that with which <HI>Alexander</HI> gain'd the Empire of the Ea&s;t; and perhaps had not bin inferior in Valor, if it had bin as well commanded. Many poor and almo&s;t unknown Nations have bin carry'd to &s;uch a height of
<PB N="148" REF="156">
  Glory by the Bravery of their Princes, that I might incline to think their Government as fit as any other for di&s;ciplining a People to War, if their Vertues continu'd in their Familys, or could be tran&s;mitted to their Suc|ce&s;&s;ors. The impo&s;&s;ibility of this is a breach never to be repair'd; and no account is to be made of the good that is always uncertain, and &s;eldom enjoy'd. This di&s;ea&s;e is not only in ab&s;olute Monarchys, but in tho&s;e al&s;o where any regard is had to Succe&s;&s;ion of Blood, tho under the &s;tricte&s;t limitations. The Fruit of all the Victorys gain'd by <HI>Edward</HI> the Fir&s;t and Third, or <HI>Henry</HI> the Fifth of <HI>England,</HI> peri&s;h'd by the ba&s;ene&s;s of their Succe&s;&s;ors: the glory of our Arms was turn'd into &s;hame; and we, by the lo&s;s of Trea&s;ure, Blood, and Territory, &s;uffer'd the puni&s;h|ment of their Vices. The effects of the&s;e changes are not always equally violent; but they are frequent, and mu&s;t fall out as often as occa&s;ion is pre&s;ented. It was not po&s;&s;ible for <HI>Lewis</HI> the Thirteenth of <HI>France</HI> to pur|&s;ue the great de&s;igns of <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth: <HI>Chri&s;tina</HI> of <HI>Sweden</HI> could not &s;upply the place of her brave Father; nor the pre&s;ent King in his In|fancy accompli&s;h what the great <HI>Charles Gu&s;tavus</HI> had nobly undertaken: and no remedy can be found for this mortal infirmity, unle&s;s the power be put into the hands of tho&s;e who are able to execute it, and not left to the blindne&s;s of fortune. When the Regal Power is committed to an an|nual or otherwi&s;e cho&s;en Magi&s;tracy, the Vertues of excellent men are of u&s;e, but all dos not depend upon their per&s;ons: One man fini&s;hes what a|nother had begun; and when many are by practice render'd able to per|form the &s;ame things, the lo&s;s of one is ea&s;ily &s;upply'd by the election of another. When good Principles are planted, they do not die with the per&s;on that introduc'd 'em; and good Con&s;titutions remain, tho the Au|thors of 'em peri&s;h. <HI>Rome</HI> did not fall back into &s;lavery when <HI>Brutus</HI> was kill'd, who had led them to recover their Liberty: Others like to him pur&s;u'd the &s;ame ends; and notwith&s;tanding the lo&s;s of &s;o many great Commanders con&s;um'd in their almo&s;t continual Wars, they never wanted &s;uch as were fit to execute whatever they could de&s;ign. A well|govern'd State is as fruitful to all good purpo&s;es, as the &s;even-headed Ser|pent is &s;aid to have bin in evil; when one head is cut off, many ri&s;e up in the place of it. Good Order being once e&s;tabli&s;h'd, makes good men; and as long as it la&s;ts, &s;uch as are fit for the greate&s;t imployments will never be wanting. By this means the <HI>Romans</HI> could not be &s;urpris'd: No King or Captain ever invaded them, who did not find many excellent Com|manders to oppo&s;e him; whereas they them&s;elves found it ea&s;y to over|throw Kingdoms, tho they had bin e&s;tabli&s;h'd by the brave&s;t Princes, thro the ba&s;ene&s;s of their Succe&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>But if our Author &s;ays true, 'tis of no advantage to a popular State to have excellent men; and therefore he impo&s;es <HI>a nece&s;&s;ity upon every People to chu&s;e the wor&s;t men for being the wor&s;t, and mo&s;t like to them&s;elves; le&s;t that if vertuous and good men &s;hould come into power, they &s;hould be ex|cluded for being vicious and wicked,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Wi&s;e men would &s;eize upon the State, and take it from the People.</HI> For the under&s;tanding of the&s;e words, 'tis good to con&s;ider whether they are to be taken &s;imply, as u&s;ually ap|ply'd to the Devil and &s;ome of his in&s;truments, or relatively, as to the thing in que&s;tion: If &s;imply, it mu&s;t be concluded that <HI>Valerius, Brutus, Cincinnatus, Capitolinus, Mamercus, Paulus Emilius, Na&s;ica,</HI> and others like to 'em, were not only the wor&s;t men of the City; but that they were &s;o often advanc'd to the &s;upreme Magi&s;tracy becau&s;e they were &s;o: if in the other &s;en&s;e relating to Magi&s;tracy, and the command of
<PB N="149" REF="157">
Armys, the wor&s;t are the mo&s;t ignorant, unfaithful, &s;lothful, or coward|ly;   and our Author, to make good his propo&s;ition, mu&s;t prove, that when the People of <HI>Rome, Carthage, Athens,</HI> and other States had the power of chu&s;ing whom they pleas'd, they cho&s;e <HI>Camillus, Corvinus. Tor|quatus, Fabius, Rullus, Scipio, Amilcar, Hannibal, A&s;drubal, Pelopidas, Epaminondas, Pericles, Ari&s;tides, Themi&s;tocles, Phocion, Alcibiades,</HI> and others like to them, for their Ignorance, Infidelity, Sloth, and Cowar|dice; and on account of tho&s;e Vices, mo&s;t like to tho&s;e who cho&s;e them. But if the&s;e were the wor&s;t, I de&s;ire to know what wit or eloquence can de&s;cribe or comprehend the excellency of the be&s;t; or of the Di&s;ciplin that brings whole Nations to &s;uch perfection, that wor&s;e than the&s;e could not be found among them? And if they were not &s;o, but &s;uch as all &s;uc|ceeding Ages have ju&s;tly admir'd for their Wi&s;dom, Vertue, Indu&s;try, and Valor, the impudence of &s;o wicked and fal&s;e an A&s;&s;ertion ought to be rejected with &s;corn and hatred.</P>
<P>But if all Governments, whether Monarchial or Popular, ab&s;olute or limited, de&s;erve prai&s;e or blame as they are well or ill con&s;tituted for ma|king War; and that the attainment of this end dos intirely depend upon the qualifications of the Commanders, and the Strength, Courage, Number, Affection, and temper of the People out of which the Ar|mys are drawn; tho&s;e Governments mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the be&s;t which take the be&s;t care that tho&s;e Armys may be well commanded; and &s;o provide for the good of the People, that they may daily increa&s;e in Num|ber, Courage, and Strength, and be &s;o &s;atisfy'd with the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, as to fear a change, and fight for the pre&s;ervation or advancement of the publick Intere&s;t as of their own. We have already found that in Hereditary Monarchys no care at all is taken of the Commander: He is not cho&s;en, but comes by chance; and dos not only frequently prove defective, but for the mo&s;t part utterly uncapable of performing any part of his duty; whereas in Popular Governments excellent men are general|ly cho&s;en; and there are &s;o many of them, that if one or more peri&s;h, others are ready to &s;upply their places. And this Di&s;cour&s;e having (if I mi&s;take not) in the whole &s;eries &s;hewn, that the advantages of popu|lar Governments, in relation to the increa&s;e of Courage, Number, and Strength in a People, out of which Armys are to be form'd, and bringing them to &s;uch a temper as prepares 'em bravely to perform their duty, are as much above tho&s;e of Monarchys, as the prudence of Choice &s;urpa&s;&s;es the accidents of Birth; it cannot be deny'd that in both re&s;pects the part which relates to War is much better perform'd in Popular Governments than in Monarchys.</P>
<P>That which we are by rea&s;on led to believe, is confirm'd to us by experi|ence. We every where &s;ee the difference between the Courage of men fighting for them&s;elves and their po&s;terity, and tho&s;e that &s;erve a Ma&s;ter who by good &s;ucce&s;s is often render'd in&s;upportable. This is of &s;uch effi|cacy, that no King could ever boa&s;t to have overthrown any con&s;iderable Commonwealth, unle&s;s it were divided within it &s;elf, or weaken'd by Wars made with &s;uch as were al&s;o free; which was the ca&s;e of the <HI>Greci|an</HI> Commonwealths when the <HI>Macedonians</HI> fell in upon them. Whereas the greate&s;t Kingdoms have bin ea&s;ily de&s;troy'd by Commonwealths; and the&s;e al&s;o have lo&s;t all Strength, Valor and Spirit, after the change of their Government. The Power and Vertue of the <HI>Italians</HI> grew up, de|cay'd and peri&s;h'd with their Liberty. When they were divided into many Commonwealths, every one of them was able to &s;end out great
<PB N="150" REF="158">
  Armys, and to &s;uffer many Defeats before they were &s;ubdu'd; &s;o that their Citys were deliver'd up by the old Men, Women, and Children, when all tho&s;e who were able to bear arms had bin &s;lain: And when they were all brought under the <HI>Romans,</HI> either as A&s;&s;ociats or Subjects, they made the greate&s;t Strength that ever was in the World.</P>
<P><HI>Alexander</HI> of <HI>Epirus</HI> was in Valor thought equal, and in Power little inferior to <HI>Alexander</HI> of <HI>Macedon:</HI> but having the fortune to attack tho&s;e who had bin brought up in Liberty, taught to hazard or &s;uffer all things for it, and to think that God has given to men Hands and Swords only to defend it, he peri&s;h'd in his attempt; whil&s;t the other encountring &s;lavi&s;h Nations, under the conduct of proud, cruel and for the mo&s;t part unwarlike Tyrants, became Ma&s;ter of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pyrrhus</HI> &s;eems to have bin equal to either of them; but the Victo|rys he obtain'd by an admirable Valor and Conduct, co&s;t him &s;o dear, that he de&s;ir'd Peace with tho&s;e Enemys who might be defeated, not &s;ub|du'd.</P>
<P><HI>Hannibal</HI> wanting the prudence of <HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> lo&s;t the fruits of all his Victorys; and being torn out of <HI>Italy,</HI> where he had ne&s;ted him&s;elf, fell under the Sword of tho&s;e who&s;e Fathers he had defeated or &s;lain; and dy'd a bani&s;h'd man from his ruin'd Country.</P>
<P>The <HI>Gauls</HI> did once bring <HI>Rome,</HI> when it was &s;mall, to the brink of De&s;truction; but they left their Carca&s;es to pay for the mi&s;chiefs they had done; and in &s;ucceeding times their Inva&s;ions were mention'd as Tumults rather than Wars.</P>
<P>The <HI>Germans</HI> did perhaps &s;urpa&s;s them in numbers and &s;trength, and were equal to them in fortune as long as <HI>Rome</HI> was free. They often enter'd <HI>Italy,</HI> but they continu'd not long there, unle&s;s under the weight of their Chains. Whereas the &s;ame Nations, and others like to them, a&s;&s;aulting that Country, or other Provinces under the Emperors, found no other difficulty than what aro&s;e upon conte&s;ts among them&s;elves who &s;hould be Ma&s;ter of them. No manly Vertue or Di&s;ciplin remain'd among the <HI>Italians:</HI> Tho&s;e who govern'd them, rely'd upon tricks and &s;hifts; they who could not defend them&s;elves, hir'd &s;ome of tho&s;e Nations to under|take their Quarrels again&s;t others. The&s;e trinklings could not la&s;t. The <HI>Goths</HI> &s;corning to depend upon tho&s;e who in Valor and Strength were much inferior to them&s;elves, &s;eiz'd upon the City that had commanded the World, whil&s;t <HI>Honorius</HI> was &s;o bu&s;y in providing for his Hens, that he could not think of defending it. <HI>Arcadius</HI> had the luck not to lo&s;e his prin|cipal City; but pa&s;&s;ing his time among Fidlers, Players, Eunuchs, Cooks, Dancers, and Buffoons, the Provinces were &s;ecurely plunder'd and ran&s;ack'd by Nations, that are known only from their Victorys a|gain&s;t him.</P>
<P>'Tis in vain to &s;ay that this proceeded from the fatal corruption of that Age; for that corruption proceeded from the Government, and the en|&s;uing de&s;olation was the effect of it. And as the like di&s;order in Govern|ment has bin ever &s;ince in <HI>Greece</HI> and the greate&s;t part of <HI>Italy,</HI> tho&s;e Coun|trys which for Extent, Riches, convenience of Situation, and numbers of men, are equal to the be&s;t in the world, and for the Wit, Courage, and Indu&s;try of the Natives, perhaps ju&s;tly preferable to any, have &s;ince that time bin always expos'd as a prey to the fir&s;t Invader. <HI>Charles</HI> the Eighth of <HI>France</HI> is by <HI>Guicciardin,</HI> and other Writers, repre&s;ented as a Prince equal|ly weak in Body, Mind, Mony, and Forces; but as an ill Hare is &s;aid to make a good Dog, he conquer'd the be&s;t part of <HI>Italy</HI> without breaking

<P>The &s;ame things are no le&s;s evident in <HI>Spain.</HI> No People ever defended them&s;elves with more Ob&s;tinacy and Valor than the <HI>Spaniards</HI> did again&s;t the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> who &s;urpa&s;t them in Wealth and Skill. <HI>Livy</HI> calls them <HI>Gentem ad bella gerenda &amp; reparanda natam,</HI> and who ge|nerally kill'd them&s;elves when they were ma&s;ter'd and di&s;arm'd, <HI>Nullam &s;ine armis vitam e&s;&s;e rati.</HI> But tho the mixture of <HI>Roman</HI> Blood could not impair their Race, and the conjunction of the <HI>Goths</HI> had improv'd their Force; yet no more was requir'd for the overthrow of them all, than the weakne&s;s and ba&s;ene&s;s of the two leud Tyrants, <HI>Witza</HI> and <HI>Rodrigo,</HI> who di&s;dain'd all Laws, and re&s;olv'd to govern according to their Lu&s;t. They who for more than two hundred years had re&s;i&s;ted the <HI>Romans,</HI> were intirely &s;ubdu'd by the vile, half-naked <HI>Moors,</HI> in one &s;light Skirmi&s;h; and do not to this day know what became of the King who brought the De|&s;truction upon them. That Kingdom after many Revolutions, is with many others come to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and enjoys all the Wealth of the <HI>Indys;</HI> whereupon they are thought to have affected an univer&s;al Mo|narchy. <HI>Sed ut &s;unt levia Aulicorum ingenia,</HI> this was grounded upon nothing except their own Vanity: They had Mony and Craft; but wanting that &s;olid Vertue and Strength which makes and pre&s;erves Con|que&s;ts, their Kings have nothing but <HI>Milan</HI> that did not come to them by Marriage: And tho they have not receiv'd any extraordinary di&s;a&s;ters in War, yet they langui&s;h and con&s;ume thro the defects of their own Go|vernment, and are forc'd to beg a&s;&s;i&s;tance from their mortal and formerly de&s;pis'd Enemys. The&s;e are the be&s;t hopes of defence that they have from abroad; and the only Enemy an Invader ought to fear in their de|&s;olate Territorys, is that Want and Famin which te&s;tifys the good Order, Strength and Stability of our Author's divine Monarchy; the profound Wi&s;dom of their Kings in &s;ubtilly finding out &s;o &s;ure a way of defending the Country; their paternal care in providing for the good of their Sub|jects; and that what&s;oever is defective in the Prince, is a&s;&s;uredly &s;upply'd by the Sedulity of a good Council.</P>
<P>We have already &s;aid enough to obviate the objections that may be drawn from the pro&s;perity of the <HI>French</HI> Monarchy. The beauty of it is fal&s;e and painted. There is a rich and haughty King, who is ble&s;t with &s;uch Neighbours as are not likely to di&s;turb him, and has nothing to fear from his mi&s;erable Subjects; but the whole body of that State is full of boils, and wounds, and putrid &s;ores: There is no real &s;trength in it. The People are &s;o unwilling to &s;erve him, that he is &s;aid to have put to death above four &s;core thou&s;and of his own Soldiers within the &s;pace of fifteen years, for flying from their Colours; and if he were vigorou&s;ly attack'd, little help could be expected from a di&s;contented Nobility, or a &s;tarving and de&s;pairing People. If to dimini&s;h the force of the&s;e arguments and examples, it be &s;aid, that in two or three thou&s;and years all things are chang'd; the antient Vertue of Mankind is extingui&s;h'd; and the love that every one had to his Country is turn'd into a care of his private In|tere&s;ts:

  I an&s;wer, that Time changes nothing, and the Changes produc'd in this time proceed only from the change of Governments.

<HEAD>SECT. XXIV. Popular Governments are le&s;s &s;ubject to Civil Di&s;orders than Monar|chys; manage them more ably, and more ea&s;ily recover out of them.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS in vain to &s;eek a Government in all points free from a po&s;&s;ibility of Civil Wars, Tumults, and Seditions: that is a Ble&s;&s;ing de|ny'd to this life, and re&s;erv'd to compleat the Felicity of the next. But if the&s;e are to be accounted the greate&s;t evils that can fall upon a People, the rectitude or defects of Governments will be&s;t appear if we examin which <HI>Species</HI> is more or le&s;s expos'd to, or exempted from them.</P>
<P>This may be done two ways.</P>
<P>1. By &s;earching into the cau&s;es from whence they may, or u&s;ually do ari&s;e.</P>
<P>2. Which kind has actually bin mo&s;t frequently and dangerou&s;ly di|&s;turb'd by them.</P>
<P>To the fir&s;t: Seditions, Tumults, and Wars do ari&s;e from mi&s;take, or from malice; from ju&s;t occa&s;ions, or unju&s;t. From mi&s;take, when a Peo|ple think an evil to be done or intended, which is not done nor intended; or take that to be evil which is done, tho in truth it be not &s;o. Well re|gulated Citys may fall into the&s;e errors. The <HI>Romans</HI> being jealous of their newly recover'd Liberty, thought that <HI>Valerius Publicola</HI> de&s;ign'd to make him&s;elf King, when he built a Hou&s;e in a place that &s;eem'd too &s;trong and eminent for a private man. The <HI>Spartans</HI> were not le&s;s &s;u&s;|picious of <HI>Lycurgus;</HI> and a leud young Fellow in a Sedition put out one of his eyes: but no People ever continu'd in a more con&s;tant af|fection to their be&s;t de&s;erving Citizens, than both the <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Spartans</HI> afterwards manife&s;ted to tho&s;e vertuous and wrongfully &s;u&s;pect|ed men.</P>
<P>Sometimes the fact is true, but otherwi&s;e under&s;tood than was intend|ed. When the <HI>Tarquins</HI> were expel'd from <HI>Rome,</HI> the Patricians retain'd to them&s;elves the principal Magi&s;tracys; but never thought of bringing back Kings, or of &s;etting up a corrupt Oligarchy among them&s;elves, as the Plebeians imagin'd: And this mi&s;take being di&s;cover'd, the fury they
<PB N="153" REF="161">
had conceiv'd, vani&s;h'd; and they who &s;eem'd to intend nothing le&s;s   than the extirpation of all the Patrician Familys, grew quiet. <HI>Menenius Agrippa</HI> appeas'd one of the mo&s;t violent Seditions that ever happen'd a|mong&s;t them (till civil Intere&s;ts were pur&s;u'd by arm'd Troops) with a Fable of the &s;everal parts of the Body that murmur'd again&s;t the Belly: and the mo&s;t dangerous of all was compos'd by creating Tribuns to protect them. Some of the Patrician young men had favour'd the <HI>De|cemviri,</HI> and others being unwilling to appear again&s;t them, the People believ'd they had all con&s;pir'd with tho&s;e new Tyrants: but <HI>Valerius</HI> and <HI>Horatius</HI> putting them&s;elves at the head of tho&s;e who &s;ought their de|&s;truction, they perceiv'd their Error, and look'd upon the <HI>Patricians</HI> as the be&s;t defenders of their Libertys: <HI>Et inde,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Livy, auram Libertatis captare, unde &s;ervitutem timui&s;&s;ent.</HI> Democratical Governments are mo&s;t liable to the&s;e mi&s;takes: In Ari&s;tocracys they are &s;eldom &s;een, and we hear of none in <HI>Sparta</HI> after the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Laws by <HI>Lycurgus.</HI> But Ab&s;olute Monarchys &s;eem to be totally exempted from them. The mi&s;chiefs de&s;ign'd are often di&s;&s;embled or deny'd, till they are pa&s;t all po&s;|&s;ibility of being cur'd by any other way than force: and &s;uch as are by nece&s;&s;ity driven to u&s;e that remedy, know they mu&s;t perfect their work or peri&s;h. He that draws his Sword again&s;t the Prince, &s;ay the <HI>French,</HI> ought to throw away the Scabbard; for tho the de&s;ign be never &s;o ju&s;t, yet the Authors are &s;ure to be ruin'd if it mi&s;carry. Peace is &s;eldom made, and never kept, unle&s;s the Subject retain &s;uch a Power in his hands, as may oblige the Prince to &s;tand to what is agreed; and in time &s;ome trick is found to deprive them of that benefit.</P>
<P>Seditions proceeding from malice, are &s;eldom or never &s;een in popular Governments; for they are hurtful to the People, and none have ever willingly and knowingly hurt them&s;elves. There may be, and often is malice in tho&s;e who excite them; but the People are ever deceiv'd, and what&s;oever is thereupon done, ought to be imputed to error, as I &s;aid be|fore. If this be di&s;cover'd in time, it u&s;ually turns to the de&s;truction of the Contriver; as in the ca&s;es of <HI>Manlius Capitolinus, Spurius Melius,</HI> and <HI>Sp. Ca&s;&s;ius:</HI> if not, for the mo&s;t part it produces a Tyranny, as in tho&s;e of <HI>Agathocles, Diony&s;ius, Pi&s;istrates,</HI> and <HI>Ce&s;ar.</HI> But in Ab&s;olute Monarchys, almo&s;t all the Troubles that ari&s;e, proceed from malice; they cannot be reform'd, the extinction of them is exceeding difficult, if they have continu'd long enough to corrupt the People; and tho&s;e who appear again&s;t 'em, &s;eek only to &s;et up them&s;elves, or their Friends. Thus we &s;ee that in the Civil Wars of the Ea&s;t, the que&s;tion was, Whe|ther <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> or <HI>Cyrus, Phraartes</HI> or <HI>Bardanes,</HI> &s;hould reign over the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Parthians:</HI> The People &s;uffer'd equally from both whil&s;t the Conte&s;ts la&s;ted; and the deci&s;ion left 'em under the power of a proud and cruel Ma&s;ter. The like is &s;een in all places. After the death of <HI>Brutus</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;&s;ius,</HI> no War was ever undertaken in the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire upon a better account than one man's private concernments: The Provinces &s;uffer'd un|der all; and he, whom they had a&s;&s;i&s;ted to overthrow one wicked Tyrant, very often prov'd wor&s;e than his Predece&s;&s;or. And the only ground of all the Di&s;&s;en&s;ions with which <HI>France</HI> was vex'd under the Princes of <HI>Me|roveus</HI> and <HI>Pepin</HI>'s Races, were, which of them &s;hould reign, the People remaining mi&s;erable under them all.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e is not much different in mix'd Monarchys: Some Wars may be undertaken upon a ju&s;t and publick account, but the pretences are com|monly fal&s;e: a la&s;ting Reformation is hardly introduc'd, an intire Change
<PB N="154" REF="162">
  often di&s;lik'd. And tho &s;uch Kingdoms are frequently and terribly di|&s;tracted, as appears by the beforemention'd Examples of <HI>England, Spain,</HI> &amp;c. the Quarrels are for the mo&s;t part begun upon per&s;onal Titles, as be|tween <HI>Henry</HI> the Fir&s;t and <HI>Robert; Stephen</HI> and <HI>Maud;</HI> or the Hou&s;es of <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> and <HI>York:</HI> and the People who get nothing by the Victory which way &s;oever it fall, and might therefore prudently leave the Com|petitors to decide their own Quarrels, like <HI>Theore&s;tes</HI> and <HI>Polinices,</HI> with their own Swords, become cruelly engag'd in them.</P>
<P>It may &s;eem &s;trange to &s;ome that I mention Seditions, Tumults, and Wars, upon ju&s;t occa&s;ions; but I can find no rea&s;on to retract the term. God intending that men &s;hould live ju&s;tly with one another, dos certainly intend that he or they who do no wrong, &s;hould &s;uffer none; and the Law that forbids Injurys, were of no u&s;e, if no Penalty might be in|flicted on tho&s;e who will not obey it. If Inju&s;tice therefore be evil, and Injurys forbidden, they are al&s;o to be puni&s;h'd; and the Law in&s;tituted for their prevention, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily intend the avenging of &s;uch as can|not be prevented. The work of the Magi&s;tracy is to execute this Law; the Sword of Ju&s;tice is put into their hands to re&s;train the fury of tho&s;e within the Society who will not be a Law to them&s;elves; and the Sword of War to protect the people again&s;t the violence of Foreigners. This is without exception, and would be in vain if it were not. But the Magi|&s;trate who is to protect the People from Injury, may, and is often known not to have done it: he &s;ometimes renders his Office u&s;ele&s;s by neglecting to do Ju&s;tice; &s;ometimes mi&s;chievous by overthrowing it. This &s;trikes at the root of God's general Ordinance, That there &s;hould be Laws; and the particular Ordinances of all Societys, that appoint &s;uch as &s;eem be&s;t to them. The Magi&s;trate therefore is comprehended under both, and &s;ub|ject to both, as well as private men.</P>
<P>The ways of preventing or puni&s;hing Injurys, are Judicial or Extraju|dicial. Judicial proceedings are of force again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;ubmit or may be brought to trial, but are of no effect again&s;t tho&s;e who re&s;i&s;t, and are of &s;uch power that they cannot be con&s;train'd. It were ab&s;urd to cite a man to appear before a Tribunal who can aw the Judges, or has Armys to de|fend him; and impious to think that he who has added Treachery to his other Crimes, and u&s;urp'd a Power above the Law, &s;hould be protected by the enormity of his wickedne&s;s. Legal proceedings therefore are to be us'd when the Delinquent &s;ubmits to the Law; and all are ju&s;t, when he will not be kept in order by the legal.</P>
<P>The word Sedition is generally apply'd to all numerous A&s;&s;emblys, without or again&s;t the Authority of the Magi&s;trate, or of tho&s;e who a&s;|&s;ume that Power. <HI>Athaliah</HI> and <HI>Jezabel</HI> were more ready to cry out Trea|&s;on than <HI>David;</HI> and examples of that &s;ort are &s;o frequent, that I need not alledg them.</P>
<P>Tumult is from the di&s;orderly manner of tho&s;e A&s;&s;emblys, where things can &s;eldom be done regularly; and War is that <HI>Decertatio per vim,</HI> or trial by force, to which men come when other ways are inef|fectual.</P>
<P>If the Laws of God and Men are therefore of no effect, when the Magi&s;tracy is left at liberty to break them; and if the Lu&s;ts of tho&s;e who are too &s;trong for the Tribunals of Ju&s;tice, cannot be otherwi&s;e re&s;train'd than by Sedition, Tumults and War, tho&s;e Seditions, Tumults, and Wars, are ju&s;tify'd by the Laws of God and Man.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="163">
I will not take upon me to enumerate all the ca&s;es in which this may be   done, but content my &s;elf with three, which have mo&s;t frequently given occa&s;ion for proceedings of this kind.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is, When one or more men take upon them the Power and Name of a Magi&s;tracy, to which they are not ju&s;tly call'd.</P>
<P>The &s;econd, When one or more being ju&s;tly call'd, continue in their Magi&s;tracy longer than the Laws by which they are call'd do pre&s;cribe.</P>
<P>And the third, When he or they who are rightly call'd, do a&s;&s;ume a Power, tho within the time pre&s;crib'd, that the Law dos not give; or turn that which the Law dos give, to an end different and contrary to that which is intended by it.</P>
<P>For the fir&s;t; <HI>Filmer</HI> forbids us to examin Titles: he tells us, we mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the Power, whether acquir'd by U&s;urpation or otherwi&s;e, not ob&s;erving the mi&s;chievous Ab&s;urdity of rewarding the mo&s;t dete&s;table Villanys with the highe&s;t Honors, and rendering the veneration due to the &s;upreme Magi&s;trate as Father of the People, to one who has no other ad|vantage above his Brethren, than what he has gain'd by injuriou&s;ly di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing or murdering him that was &s;o. <HI>Hobbs</HI> fearing the advantages that may be taken from &s;uch de&s;perate non&s;en&s;e, or not thinking it nece&s;|&s;ary to his end to carry the matter &s;o far, has no regard at all to him who comes in without Title or Con&s;ent; and denying him to be either King or Tyrant, gives him no other name than <HI>Ho&s;tis &amp; Latro,</HI> and allows all things to be lawful again&s;t him, that may be done to a publick Enemy or Pyrat: which is as much as to &s;ay, any man may de&s;troy him how he can. Whatever he may be guilty of in other re&s;pects, he dos in this fol|low the voice of Mankind, and the dictates of common &s;en&s;e: for no man can make him&s;elf a Magi&s;trate for him&s;elf, and no man can have the <NOTE PLACE="marg">De Civ. l. 2.</NOTE>right of a Magi&s;trate, who is not a Magi&s;trate. If he be ju&s;tly account|ed an Enemy to all, who injures all; he above all mu&s;t be the publick Enemy of a Nation, who by u&s;urping a power over them, dos the greate&s;t and mo&s;t publick injury that a People can &s;uffer: For which rea|&s;on, by an e&s;tabli&s;h'd Law among the mo&s;t vertuous Nations, every man might kill a Tyrant; and no Names are recorded in Hi&s;tory with more honor, than of tho&s;e who did it.</P>
<P>The&s;e are by other Authors call'd <HI>Tyranni &s;ine titulo,</HI> and that name is given to all tho&s;e who obtain the &s;upreme Power by illegal and unju&s;t means. The Laws which they overthrow can give them no protection; and every man is a Soldier again&s;t him who is a publick E|nemy.</P>
<P>The &s;ame rule holds, tho they are more in number; as the <HI>Magi,</HI> who u&s;urp'd the Dominion of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> after the death of <HI>Camby&s;es;</HI> the thirty Tyrants at <HI>Athens</HI> overthrown by <HI>Thra&s;ibulus;</HI> tho&s;e of <HI>Thebes</HI> &s;lain by <HI>Pelopidas;</HI> the <HI>Decemviri</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> and others: For tho the multitude of Offenders may &s;ometimes procure impunity, yet that act which is wicked in one, mu&s;t be &s;o in ten or twenty; and what&s;oever is lawful again&s;t one U&s;urper, is &s;o again&s;t them all.</P>
<P>2. If tho&s;e who were rightly created, continue beyond the time li|mited by the Law, 'tis the &s;ame thing. That which is expir'd, is as if it had never bin. He that was created Con&s;ul for a year, or Dictator for &s;ix months, was after that a private man; and if he had continu'd in the exerci&s;e of his Magi&s;tracy, had bin &s;ubject to the &s;ame puni&s;hment as if he had u&s;urp'd it at the fir&s;t. This was known to <HI>Epaminondas,</HI> who finding that his Enterprize again&s;t <HI>Sparta</HI> could not be accompli&s;h'd
<PB N="156" REF="164">
  within the time for which he was made <HI>Boeotarches,</HI> rather cho&s;e to tru&s;t his Countrymen with his life than to de&s;i&s;t, and was &s;av'd merely thro an admiration of his Vertue, a&s;&s;urance of his good Intentions, and the glory of the Action.</P>
<P>The <HI>Roman Decemviri,</HI> tho duly elected, were proceeded again&s;t as private men u&s;urping the Magi&s;tracy, when they continu'd beyond their time. Other Magi&s;trats had ceas'd; there was none that could regularly call the Senat or People to an A&s;&s;embly: but when their ambition was manife&s;t, and the People exa&s;perated by the death of <HI>Virginia,</HI> they laid a&s;ide all ceremonys. The Senat and People met, and exerci&s;ing their Authority in the &s;ame manner as if they had bin regularly call'd by the Magi&s;trate appointed to that end, they abrogated the Power of the <HI>De|cemviri,</HI> proceeded again&s;t them as Enemys and Tyrants, and by that means pre&s;erv'd them&s;elves from utter ruin.</P>
<P>3. The &s;ame cour&s;e is ju&s;tly us'd again&s;t a legal Magi&s;trate, who takes upon him (tho within the time pre&s;crib'd by the Law) to exerci&s;e a Power which the Law dos not give; for in that re&s;pect he is a private man, <HI>Quia,</HI> as <HI>Grotius</HI> &s;ays, <HI>eatenus non habet imperium;</HI> and may be re|&s;train'd as well as any other, becau&s;e he is not &s;et up to do what he li&s;ts, but what the Law appoints for the good of the People: and as he has no other Power than what the Law allows, &s;o the &s;ame Law limits and di|rects the exerci&s;e of that which he has. This Right naturally belonging to Nations, is no way impair'd by the name of <HI>Supreme</HI> given to their Magi&s;trats; for it &s;ignifys no more, than that they do act &s;overeignly in the matters committed to their charge. Thus are the Parliaments of <HI>France</HI> call'd <HI>Cours Souveraines;</HI> for they judg of Life and Death, deter|min Controver&s;ys concerning E&s;tates; and there is no appeal from their Decrees: but no man ever thought, that it was therefore lawful for them to do what they pleas'd; or that they might not be oppos'd, if they &s;hould attempt to do that which they ought not. And tho the <HI>Roman</HI> Dicta|tors and Con&s;uls were &s;upreme Magi&s;trats, they were &s;ubject to the Peo|ple, and might be puni&s;h'd as well as others if they tran&s;gre&s;t the Law. <HI>Thuanus</HI> carrys the word &s;o far, that when <HI>Barlotta, Giu&s;tiniano,</HI> and others who were but Colonels, were &s;ent as Commanders in chief of three or four thou&s;and men upon an Enterprize, he always &s;ays, <HI>Sum|mum Imperium ei delatum. Grotius</HI> explains this point, by di&s;tingui&s;hing tho&s;e who have the <HI>&s;ummum Imperium &s;ummo modo,</HI> from tho&s;e who have it <HI>modo non &s;ummo.</HI> I know not where to find an Example of this Sove|reign Power, enjoy'd without re&s;triction, under a better title than <HI>Occu|pation;</HI> which relates not to our purpo&s;e, who &s;eek only that which is legal and ju&s;t. Therefore laying a&s;ide that point for the pre&s;ent, we may <NOTE PLACE="marg">De Jur. Bell. &amp; Pac. l. 2.</NOTE>follow <HI>Grotius</HI> in examining the right of tho&s;e who are certainly limited: <HI>&V;bi partem Imperii habet Rex, partem Senatus &s;ive Populus;</HI> in which ca&s;e he &s;ays, <HI>Regi in partem non &s;uam involanti, vis ju&s;ta opponi pote&s;t,</HI> in as much as they who have a part, cannot but have a right of defend|ing that part. <HI>Quia data facultate, datur jus facultatem tuendi,</HI> without which it could be of no effect.</P>
<P>The particular limits of the Rights belonging to each, can only be judg'd by the preci&s;e Letter, or general Intention of the Law. The Dukes of <HI>Venice</HI> have certainly a part in the Government, and could not be call'd Magi&s;trats if they had not.

<P>Again, &s;ome Magi&s;trats are intru&s;ted with a power of providing Ships, Arms, Ammunition, and Victuals for War; rai&s;ing and di&s;ciplining Soldiers, appointing Officers to command in Forts and Gari&s;ons, and making Leagues with Foreign Princes and States. But if one of the&s;e &s;hould imbezel, &s;ell, or give to an Enemy tho&s;e Ships, Arms, Ammuni|tion or Provi&s;ions; betray the Forts; employ only or principally, &s;uch men as will &s;erve him in tho&s;e wicked Actions; and, contrary to the tru&s;t repos'd in him, make &s;uch Leagues with Foreigners, as tend to the advancement of his per&s;onal Intere&s;ts, and to the detriment of the Pub|lick, he abrogates his own Magi&s;tracy; and the Right he had, peri&s;hes (as the Lawyers &s;ay) <HI>fru&s;tratione finis.</HI> He cannot be protected by the Law which he has overthrown, nor obtain impunity for his Crimes from the Authority that was confer'd upon him, only that he might do good with it. He was <HI>&s;ingulis major</HI> on account of the excellency of his Office; but <HI>univer&s;is minor,</HI> from the nature and end of his In&s;titution. The &s;ure&s;t way of extingui&s;hing his Prerogative, was by turning it to the hurt of tho&s;e who gave it.

It requires Courage, Expe|rience, Indu&s;try, Fidelity and Wi&s;dom. <HI>The good Shepherd,</HI> &s;ays our Saviour, <HI>lays down his life for his Sheep:</HI> The Hireling who flies in time of danger, is repre&s;ented under an ill character; but he that &s;ets him&s;elf to de&s;troy his Flock, is a Wolf. His Authority is incompatible with their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; and whoever di&s;approves Tumults, Seditions or War, by which he may be remov'd from it, if gentler means are ineffectual, &s;ub|verts the Foundation of all Law, exalts the fury of one man to the de|&s;truction of a Nation; and giving an irre&s;i&s;tible Power to the mo&s;t abo|minable Iniquity, expo&s;es all that are good to be de&s;troy'd, and Vertue to be utterly extingui&s;h'd.</P>
<P>Few will allow &s;uch a Preeminence to the Dukes of <HI>Venice</HI> or <HI>Genoa,</HI> the Advoyers of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> or the Burgoma&s;ters of <HI>Am&s;terdam.</HI> Ma|ny will &s;ay the&s;e are Ra&s;cals if they prove fal&s;e, and ought rather to be hang'd, than &s;uffer'd to accompli&s;h the Villanys they de&s;ign. But if this be confe&s;t in relation to the highe&s;t Magi&s;trats that are among tho&s;e Na|tions, why &s;hould not the &s;ame be in all others, by what name &s;oever they are call'd? When did God confer upon tho&s;e Nations the extraor|dinary privilege of providing better for their own &s;afety than others?

Is there a charm in words, or any name of &s;uch effi|cacy, that he who receives it &s;hould immediately become Ma&s;ter of tho&s;e that created him, whereas all others do remain for ever &s;ubject to them? Would the <HI>Venetian</HI> Government change its nature, if they &s;hould give the name of King to their Prince? Are the <HI>Polanders</HI> le&s;s &s;ree &s;ince the title of King is confer'd upon their Dukes; or are the <HI>Mo&s;covites</HI> le&s;s Slaves, be|cau&s;e their chief Magi&s;trate has no other than that of Duke? If we exa|min things but a little, 'twill appear that Magi&s;trats have enjoy'd large Powers, who never had the name of Kings; and none were ever more re&s;train'd by Laws than tho&s;e of <HI>Sparta, Arragon,</HI> the <HI>Goths</HI> in <HI>Spain, Hungary, Bohemia, Sweden, Denmark, Poland,</HI> and others, who had that Title. There is therefore no &s;uch thing as a Right univer&s;ally belonging to a Name; but every one enjoys that which the Laws, by which he is, con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">er upon him. The Law that gives the Power, regulates it; and they who give no more than what they plea&s;e, cannot be oblig'd to &s;uffer him to whom they give it, to take more than they thought fit to give, or to go unpuni&s;h'd if he do. The Agreements made are always con|firm'd by Oath, and the treachery of violating them is con&s;equently ag|gravated by Perjury. They are good Philo&s;ophers and able Divines, who think this can create a Right to tho&s;e who had none; or that the Laws can be a protection to &s;uch as overthrow them, and give op|portunity of doing the mi&s;chiefs they de&s;ign. If it do not, then he that was a Magi&s;trate, by &s;uch actions returns into the condition of a private man; and whatever is lawful again&s;t a Thief who &s;ubmits to no Law, is lawful again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Men who delight in cavils may ask, Who &s;hall be the Judg of the&s;e oc|ca&s;ions? And whether I intend to give to the People the deci&s;ion of their own Cau&s;e? To which I an&s;wer, that when the conte&s;t is between the Ma|gi&s;trate and the People, the party to which the determination is refer'd, mu&s;t be the Judg of his own ca&s;e; and the que&s;tion is only, Whether the Magi&s;trate &s;hould depend on the Judgment of the People, or the Peo|ple on that of the Magi&s;trate; and which is mo&s;t to be &s;u&s;pected of inju|&s;tice: That is, whether the People of <HI>Rome</HI> &s;hould judg <HI>Tarquin,</HI> or <HI>Tarquin</HI> judg the People. He that knew all good men abhor'd him for the murder of his Wife, Brother, Father-in-law, and the be&s;t of the Senat, would cer|tainly &s;trike off the heads of the mo&s;t eminent remaining Poppys; and having incur'd the general hatred of the people by the wickedne&s;s of his Government, he fear'd revenge; and endeavouring to de&s;troy tho&s;e he fear'd (that is the City) he might ea&s;ily have accompli&s;h'd his work, if the judgment had bin refer'd to him. If the People judg <HI>Tarquin,</HI> 'tis hard to imagin how they &s;hould be brought to give an unju&s;t Sentence: They lov'd their former Kings, and hated him only for his Villanys: They did not fancy, but know his cruelty. When the be&s;t were &s;lain, no man that any way re&s;embled them could think him&s;elf &s;ecure. <HI>Brutus</HI> did not pretend to be a Fool, till by the murder of his Brother he found how dangerous a thing it was to be thought wi&s;e. If the people, as our Author &s;ays, be always leud, fooli&s;h, mad, wicked, and de&s;irous to put the Power into the hands of &s;uch as are mo&s;t like to them&s;elves, he and his Sons were &s;uch men as they &s;ought, and he was &s;ure to find favoura|ble Judges: If vertuous and good, no inju&s;tice was to be fear'd from them, and he could have no other rea&s;on to decline their judgment, than what was &s;ugge&s;ted by his own wickedne&s;s. <HI>Caligula, Nero, Domitian,</HI> and the like, had probably the &s;ame con&s;iderations: But no man of com|mon

&s;en&s;e ever thought that the Senat and People of <HI>Rome</HI> did not better   de&s;erve to judg, whether &s;uch Mon&s;ters &s;hould reign over the be&s;t part of mankind to their de&s;truction, than they to determin whether their Crimes &s;hould be puni&s;h'd or not.</P>
<P>If I mention &s;ome of the&s;e known Ca&s;es, every man's experience will &s;ugge&s;t others of the like nature; and who&s;oever condemns all Seditions, Tumults and Wars rais'd again&s;t &s;uch Princes, mu&s;t &s;ay, that none are wicked, or &s;eek the ruin of their People, which is ab&s;urd: for <HI>Caligula</HI> wi&s;h'd the People had but one Neck, that he might cut it off at a blow; <HI>Nero</HI> &s;et the City on fire; and we have known &s;uch as have bin wor&s;e than either of them: They mu&s;t either be &s;uffer'd to continue in the free exerci&s;e of their rage, that is, to do all the mi&s;chief they de&s;ign; or mu&s;t be re&s;train'd by a legal, judicial, or extrajudicial way; and they who di&s;allow the extrajudicial, do as little like the judicial. They will not hear of bringing a &s;upreme Magi&s;trate before a Tribunal, when it may be done. <HI>They will,</HI> &s;ays our Author, <HI>depo&s;e their Kings.</HI> Why &s;hould they not be depos'd, if they become Enemys to their People, and &s;et up an intere&s;t in their own per&s;ons incon&s;i&s;tent with the publick good, for the promoting of which they were erected? If they were created by the publick con&s;ent, for the publick good, &s;hall they not be remov'd when they prove to be of publick damage? If they &s;et up them&s;elves, may they not be thrown down? Shall it be lawful for them to u&s;urp a Power over the liberty of others, and &s;hall it not be lawful for an injur'd People to re|&s;ume their own? If inju&s;tice exalt it &s;elf, mu&s;t it be for ever e&s;tabli&s;h'd? Shall great Per&s;ons be render'd &s;acred by rapine, perjury and murder? Shall the crimes for which private men do ju&s;tly &s;uffer the mo&s;t grievous puni&s;hments, exempt them from all, who commit them in the highe&s;t ex|ce&s;s, with mo&s;t power, and mo&s;t to the prejudice of mankind? Shall the Laws that &s;olely aim at the prevention of Crimes, be made to patronize them, and become &s;nares to the innocent whom they ought to protect? Has every man given up into the common &s;tore his right of avenging the Injurys he may receive, that the publick Power which ought to protect or avenge him, &s;hould be turn'd to the de&s;truction of him&s;elf, his Po&s;te|rity, and the Society into which they enter, without any po&s;&s;ibility of redre&s;s? Shall the Ordinance of God be render'd of no effect; or the Powers he has appointed to be &s;et up for the di&s;tribution of Ju&s;tice, be made &s;ub&s;ervient to the lu&s;ts of one or a &s;ew men, and by impunity in|courage them to commit all manner of crimes? Is the corruption of man's Nature &s;o little known, that &s;uch as have common &s;en&s;e &s;hould expect Ju&s;tice from tho&s;e, who &s;ear no puni&s;hment if they do Inju&s;tice; or that the mode&s;ty, integrity, and innocence, which is &s;eldom found in one man, tho never &s;o cautiou&s;ly cho&s;en, &s;hould be con&s;tantly found in all tho&s;e who by any means attain to Greatne&s;s, and continue for ever in their Succe&s;&s;ors; or that there can be any &s;ecurity under their Government, if they have them not? Surely if this were the condition of men living under Government, Fore&s;ts would be more &s;afe than Citys; and 'twere better for every man to &s;tand in his own defence, than to enter into Societys. He that lives alone might encounter &s;uch as &s;hould a&s;&s;ault him upon equal terms, and &s;tand or fall according to the mea&s;ure of his courage and &s;trength; but no Valor can defend him, if the malice of his Enemy be upheld by a publick Power. There mu&s;t therefore be a right of pro|ceeding judicially or extrajudicially again&s;t all per&s;ons who tran&s;gre&s;s the Laws, or el&s;e tho&s;e Laws, and the Societys that &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t by them,

Extraju|dicial proceedings by Sedition, Tumult, or War, mu&s;t take place, when the per&s;ons concern'd are of &s;uch power, that they cannot be brought un|der the Judicial. They who deny this, deny all help again&s;t an u&s;urp|ing Tyrant, or the perfidiou&s;ne&s;s of a lawfully created Magi&s;trate, who adds the crimes of Ingratitude and Treachery to U&s;urpation. The&s;e of all men are the mo&s;t dangerous Enemys to &s;upreme Magi&s;trats: for as no man de&s;ires indemnity for &s;uch Crimes as are never committed, he that would exempt all from puni&s;hment, &s;uppo&s;es they will be guilty of the wor&s;t; and by concluding that the People will depo&s;e them if they have the power, acknowledg that they pur&s;ue an Intere&s;t annex'd to their Per|&s;ons, contrary to that of their People, which they would not bear if they could deliver them&s;elves from it. This &s;hewing all tho&s;e Governments to be tyrannical, lays &s;uch a burden upon tho&s;e who admini&s;ter them, as mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily weigh them down to de&s;truction.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid that the word Sedition implys that which is evil; I an&s;wer, that it ought not then to be apply'd to tho&s;e who &s;eek nothing but that which is ju&s;t; and tho the ways of delivering an oppre&s;t People from the violence of a wicked Magi&s;trate, who having arm'd a Crew of leud Villains, and fatted them with the Blood and Confi&s;cations of &s;uch as were mo&s;t ready to oppo&s;e him, be extraordinary, the inward righteou&s;|ne&s;s of the Act dos fully ju&s;tify the Authors. He that has vertue and power to &s;ave a People, can never want a right of doing it. <HI>Valerius A&s;iaticus</HI> had no hand in the death of <HI>Caligula;</HI> but when the furious Guards began tumultuou&s;ly to inquire who had kill'd him, he appea&s;ed them with <HI>wi&s;hing he had bin the man.</HI> No wi&s;e man ever ask'd by what authority <HI>Thra&s;ibulus, Harmodius, Ari&s;togiton, Pelopidas, Epaminondas, Dion, Timoleon, Lucius Brutus, Publicola, Horatius, Valerius, Marcus Brutus, C. Ca&s;&s;ius,</HI> and the like, deliver'd their Countrys from Tyrants. Their Actions carry'd in them their own ju&s;tification, and their Vertues will never be forgotten whil&s;t the names of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> are remem|ber'd in the World.</P>
<P>If this be not enough to declare the Ju&s;tice inherent in, and the Glory that ought to accompany the&s;e Works, the examples of <HI>Mo&s;es, Aaron, Othniel, Ehud, Barac, Gideon, Samuel, Jephtha, David, Jehu, Jehoiada,</HI> the <HI>Maccabees,</HI> and other holy men rais'd up by God for the deliverance of his People from their Oppre&s;&s;ors, decide the Que&s;tion. They are perpetually renown'd for having led the People by extraordinary ways (which &s;uch as our Author expre&s;s under the names of Sedition, Tumult, and War) to recover their Libertys, and avenge the injurys receiv'd from foreign or dome&s;tick Tyrants. The work of the Apo&s;tles was not in their time to &s;et up or pull down any civil State; but they &s;o behav'd them&s;elves in relation to all the Powers of the Earth, that they gain'd the name of pe&s;tilent &s;editious Fellows, Di&s;turbers of the People; and left it as an inheritance to tho&s;e, who in &s;ucceeding Ages by following their &s;teps &s;hould de&s;erve to be call'd their Succe&s;&s;ors; whereby they were expos'd to the hatred of corrupt Magi&s;trats, and brought under the nece&s;&s;ity of pe|ri&s;hing by them, or de&s;ending them&s;elves again&s;t them: and he that de|nys them that right, dos at once condemn the mo&s;t glorious Actions of the wi&s;e&s;t, be&s;t, and holie&s;t men that have bin in the world, together with the Laws of God and Man, upon which they were founded.</P>

Neverthele&s;s, there is a &s;ort of Sedition, Tumult, and War proceeding   from Malice, which is always dete&s;table, aiming only at the &s;atisfaction of private Lu&s;t, without regard to the publick Good. This cannot hap|pen in a Popular Government, unle&s;s it be among&s;t the Rabble; or when the Body of the People is &s;o corrupted, that it cannot &s;tand; but is mo&s;t frequent in, and natural to ab&s;olute Monarchys. When <HI>Abimelech</HI> de&s;ir'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">Judg. 9.</NOTE>to make him&s;elf King, he rais'd a Tumult among the ba&s;e&s;t of the Peo|ple: He hir'd light and vain Per&s;ons, &s;ome Tran&s;lations call them leud Vagabonds, kill'd his Brethren, but peri&s;h'd in his de&s;ign; the corrupt party that favor'd him not having Strength enough to &s;ubdue the other, who were more &s;incere. <HI>Sp. Melius, Sp. Ca&s;&s;ius,</HI> and <HI>Manlius</HI> attempted the like in <HI>Rome:</HI> they acted maliciou&s;ly, their pretences to procure the publick Good were fal&s;e. 'Tis probable that &s;ome in the City were as bad as they, and knew that mi&s;chief was intended; but the Body of the People not being corrupted, they were &s;uppre&s;t. It appear'd, &s;ays <HI>Livy, Nihil e&s;&s;e minus populare quam regnum:</HI> they who had favor'd <HI>Manlius,</HI> condemn'd him to death when it was prov'd, that <HI>egregias alioqui virtutes foeda regni cupidine macula&s;&s;et.</HI> But when the People is generally corrup|ted, &s;uch de&s;igns &s;eldom mi&s;carry, and the &s;ucce&s;s is always the erection of a Tyranny. Nothing el&s;e can plea&s;e vain and profligate per&s;ons, and no Tyranny was ever &s;et up by &s;uch as were better qualify'd. The ways of attaining it have always bin by corrupting the manners of the People, bribing Soldiers, entertaining mercenary Strangers, opening Pri&s;ons, giving Liberty to Slaves, alluring indigent per&s;ons with hopes of aboli&s;hing Debts, coming to a new divi&s;ion of Lands, and the like. Seditions rais'd by &s;uch men always tend to the ruin of popular Govern|ments; but when they happen under ab&s;olute Monarchys, the hurt intended is only to the Per&s;on, who being remov'd, the Promoters of 'em &s;et up another; and he that is &s;et up, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting only by the &s;trength of tho&s;e who made him, is oblig'd to foment the Vices that drew them to &s;erve him; tho another may perhaps make u&s;e of the &s;ame again&s;t him.</P>
<P>The con&s;equence of this is, That tho&s;e who uphold popular Govern|ments, look upon Vice and Indigence as mi&s;chiefs that naturally increa&s;e each other, and equally tend to the ruin of the State. When men are by Vice brought into want, they are ready for mi&s;chief: there is no Villany that men of profligate Lives, lo&s;t Reputation, and de&s;perate Fortunes will not undertake. Popular Equality is an enemy to the&s;e; and they who would pre&s;erve it, mu&s;t pre&s;erve integrity of Manners, Sobriety, and an hone&s;t contentedne&s;s with what the Law allows. On the other &s;ide, the ab&s;olute Monarch, who will have no other Law than his own Will, de&s;ires to increa&s;e the number of tho&s;e who thro leudne&s;s and beg|gery may incline to depend upon him; tho the &s;ame temper of Mind, and condition of Fortune prepare them al&s;o for &s;uch Seditions as may bring him into danger; and the &s;ame corruption which led them to &s;et him up, may invite them to &s;ell him to another that will give them better wages.</P>
<P>I do not by this conclude that all Monarchs are vicious men; but that whoever will &s;et up an ab&s;olute Power, mu&s;t do it by the&s;e means; and that if &s;uch a Power be already e&s;tabli&s;h'd, and &s;hould fall into the hands of a per&s;on, who by his Vertue and the gentlene&s;s of his Nature &s;hould endeavor to render the Yoke &s;o ea&s;y, that a better di&s;ciplin'd People might be contented to bear it; yet this method could la&s;t no longer than

  his life, and probably would be a means to &s;horten it; that which was at fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h'd by evil Arts always returning to the &s;ame: That which was vicious in the principle, can never be long upheld by Vertue; and we &s;ee that the wor&s;t of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors were not in greater dan|ger from &s;uch good men as remain'd unde&s;troy'd, than the be&s;t from the corrupt Party that would not be corrected, and &s;ought &s;uch a Ma&s;ter as would lay no re&s;triction upon their Vices. Tho&s;e few who e&s;cap'd the rage of the&s;e Villains, only gave a little breathing time to the afflicted World, which by their Children or Succe&s;&s;ors was again plung'd into that extremity of mi&s;ery, from which they intended to deliver it. An ex|traordinary Vertue was requir'd to keep a Prince in a way contrary to the principles of his own Government; which being rarely found, and ne|ver continuing long in a Family or Succe&s;&s;ion of men, the endeavors of the be&s;t became ineffectual, and either they them&s;elves peri&s;h'd in them, or after their death all things return'd into the old polluted Chan|nel.</P>
<P>Tho the Power of the Hebrew Kings was not unlimited, yet it ex|ceeded the Rules &s;et by God, and was &s;ufficient to increa&s;e the number of the wor&s;t of men, and to give them opportunitys of rai&s;ing perpetual di&s;turbances. On the King's &s;ide there were Flatterers and In&s;truments of mi&s;chief: On the other &s;ide there were indebted and di&s;contented Per&s;ons. Notwith&s;tanding the Ju&s;tice of <HI>David</HI>'s cau&s;e, the Wi&s;dom, Valor, and Piety of his Per&s;on, none would follow him, except a few of his own Kindred (who knew what God had promis'd to him) and &s;uch as were unea&s;y in their worldly circum&s;tances. After the death of <HI>Saul</HI> there was a long and bloody War between <HI>I&s;hbo&s;heth</HI> and <HI>David.</HI> The former being kill'd, the &s;lighte&s;t matters were &s;ufficient to put the whole Nation into blood. <HI>Ab&s;alom</HI> with a few fair words was able to rai&s;e all <HI>I&s;rael</HI> again&s;t his Father: <HI>Sheba</HI> the Son of <HI>Bichri</HI> with as much ea&s;e rais'd a more dangerous Tumult: <HI>David,</HI> by Wi&s;dom, Valor, and the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, &s;urmounted the&s;e Difficultys, and prepar'd a peace|able Reign for <HI>Solomon:</HI> but after his death they broke out into a Flame that was never quench'd, till the Nation was &s;o di&s;pers'd that no man knew where to find his Enemys. <HI>Solomon</HI> by his Magnificence had reduc'd <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to &s;uch poverty, as inclin'd them to revolt upon the fir&s;t offer of an opportunity by <HI>Jeroboam.</HI> From that time forward <HI>I&s;rael</HI> was perpetually vex'd with Civil Seditions and Con&s;piracys, or Wars with their Brethren of <HI>Judah.</HI> Nine Kings with their Familys were de&s;troy'd by the fir&s;t, and the latter brought &s;uch Slaughters upon the mi&s;erable People, as were never &s;uffer'd by any who were not agitated by the like Fury; and the cour&s;e of the&s;e mi&s;chiefs was never interrupted, till they had brought the Nation into Captivity, and the Country to De&s;olation. Tho God ac|cording to his promi&s;e did pre&s;erve a light in the Hou&s;e of <HI>David,</HI> yet the Tribe of <HI>Judah</HI> was not the more happy. <HI>Joa&s;h</HI> was &s;lain by a pri|vate Con&s;piracy, and <HI>Amaziah</HI> (as is mo&s;t probable) by publick Autho|rity, for having fooli&s;hly brought a terrible Slaughter upon <HI>Judah.

The whole Story is a Tragedy: and if it be pretended that this proceeded rather from the wrath of God again&s;t his People for their Idolatry, than from &s;uch cau&s;es as are applicable to other Nations; I an&s;wer, that this Idolatry was the

Notwith&s;tanding the admirable Ver|tue and Succe&s;s of <HI>Alexander,</HI> his Reign was full of Con&s;piracys, and his knowledg of them prompted him to de&s;troy <HI>Parmenio, Philotas, Clitus, Cali&s;thenes, Hermolaus,</HI> and many more of his be&s;t Friends. If he e|&s;cap'd the Sword, he fell by Poi&s;on. The Murder of his Wives, Mo|ther, and Children, by the rage of his own Soldiers; the Fury of his Captains imploy'd in mutual Slaughters, till they were con&s;um'd; his pa|ternal Kingdom after many Revolutions transfer'd to <HI>Ca&s;&s;ander</HI> his mo&s;t mortal Enemy; the utter extinction of his conquering Army, and parti|cularly the famous <HI>Argyra&s;pides,</HI> who being grown faithle&s;s and &s;editious, after the death of <HI>Eumenes</HI> were &s;ent to peri&s;h in unknown parts of the Ea&s;t, abundantly te&s;tify the admirable &s;tability, good order, peace, and quiet that is enjoy'd under ab&s;olute Monarchy. The next Government of the like nature that appear'd upon the Stage of the World was that of <HI>Rome,</HI> introduc'd by Wars that con&s;um'd two thirds of the People; con|firm'd by Pro&s;criptions, in which all that were eminent for Nobility, Riches, or Vertue, peri&s;h'd. The peace they had under <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> was like that which the Devil allow'd to the Child in the Go&s;pel, whom he rent <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mark 9. 26.</NOTE>&s;orely, and left as dead. The mi&s;erable City was only ca&s;t into a Swound: after long and violent vexations by Seditions, Tumults, and Wars, it lay as dead; and finding no helper like to him who cur'd the Child, it was deliver'd to new Devils to be tormented, till it was utterly de&s;troy'd. <HI>Tiberius</HI> was appointed as a fit in&s;trument for &s;uch a purpo&s;e. It was thought that tho&s;e who &s;hould feel the effects of his Pride, Cruelty, and Lu&s;t, would look upon the Death of <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> as a lo&s;s. He perform'd the work for which he was cho&s;en; his Reign was an uninterrupted Se|ries of Murders, Subornations, Perjurys, and Poi&s;onings, intermix'd with the mo&s;t dete&s;table Impuritys, the revolts of Provinces, and Muti|nys of Armys. The matter was not mended by his Succe&s;&s;ors: <HI>Caligula</HI> was kill'd by his own Guards; <HI>Claudius</HI> poi&s;on'd by his Wife: <HI>Spain, Gaul, Germany, Pannonia, Mae&s;ia, Syria,</HI> and <HI>Aegypt,</HI> revolted at once from <HI>Nero;</HI> the People and Senat follow'd the example of the Provinces. This I think was, in our Author's &s;en&s;e, Sedition with a witne&s;s. <HI>Nero</HI> being dead by the hand of a Slave, or his own, to prevent that of the Hangman, <HI>Galba</HI> enter'd the City with Blood and Slaughter; but when his own Soldiers found he would not give the Mony for which they intended to &s;ell the Empire, they kill'd him: and to &s;hew the &s;tability of Ab&s;olute Monarchy, it may be ob&s;erv'd, that this was not done by the advice of the Senat, or by a con&s;piracy of great men; <HI>Su&s;cepere duo ma|nipulares</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">C. Tacit. Hi&s;t&punc; l. 1.</NOTE><HI>Populi Romani Imperium transferendum, &amp; tran&s;tulerunt.</HI> Two Ra&s;cals gave the Empire to <HI>Otho,</HI> and the whole Senat was like to be butcher'd for not being &s;o ready to follow their venerable Authority as they ought to have bin, and hardly e&s;cap'd the fury of their mad and drunken Companions. As a farther te&s;timony that the&s;e Monarchys are not &s;ubject to Seditions and Tumults, he had at once only two Competi|tors again&s;t whom he was to defend the well-acquir'd Empire: His Ar|my was de&s;eated at <HI>Bre&s;cia,</HI> he kill'd him&s;elf; and his Succe&s;&s;or <HI>Vitellius</HI> was &s;oon after thrown into the Common-&s;hore. The &s;ame method &s;till continu'd: <HI>Rome</HI> was fill'd with Blood and A&s;hes; and to recite all the
<PB N="164" REF="172">
  publick Mi&s;chiefs would be to tran&s;cribe the Hi&s;tory: For as <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> be|ing ask'd who &s;hould &s;ucceed him, an&s;wer'd, He who has the &s;harpe&s;t Sword; that was the only Law that govern'd in the following ages. Whoever could corrupt two or three Legions, thought he had a good ti|tle to the Empire; and unle&s;s he happen'd to be kill'd by Treachery, or another Tumult of his own Soldiers, he &s;eldom receded from it without a Battel, wherein he that was mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful, had no other &s;ecurity than what the pre&s;ent temper of the Soldiers afforded him: and the mi&s;erable Provinces having neither Vertue nor Force, were oblig'd &s;lavi&s;hly to follow the fury or fortune of tho&s;e Villains. In this &s;tate did <HI>Rome</HI> de|dicate to <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Triumphal Arch that had bin prepar'd for <HI>Maxentius;</HI> and tho&s;e Provinces which had &s;et up <HI>Albinus</HI> and <HI>Niger</HI> &s;ubmitted to <HI>Septimius Severus.</HI> In the va&s;t variety of Accidents that in tho&s;e Ages di&s;turb'd the World, no Emperor had a better title than what he purchas'd by Mony or Violence; and enjoy'd it no longer than tho&s;e helps continu'd, which of all things were the mo&s;t uncertain. By this means mo&s;t of the Princes peri&s;h'd by the Sword, <HI>Italy</HI> was made de&s;o|late, and <HI>Rome</HI> was &s;everal times &s;ack'd and burnt. The Mi&s;tre&s;s of the World being made a Slave, the Provinces which had bin acquir'd by the Blood of her antient vertuous Citizens, became part of an U&s;urper's Patrimony, who without any regard to the publick good, di&s;tributed 'em to his Children according to their number, or his pa&s;&s;ion. The&s;e ei|ther de&s;troy'd one another, or fell under the Sword of a third who had the fortune of their Father, the greate&s;t part mo&s;t commonly falling to the &s;hare of the wor&s;t. If at any time the contrary happen'd, the Go|vernment of the be&s;t was but a lucid interval, and well-wi&s;hing men grew more extremely to abhor the darkne&s;s that follow'd when they were gone. The be&s;t of 'em could do no more than &s;u&s;pend mi&s;chief for a while, but could not correct the corrupt principle of their Government; and &s;ome of 'em were de&s;troy'd as &s;oon as they were thought to intend it: Others who fini&s;h'd their days in peace, left the Empire to &s;uch per|&s;ons of their relations as were mo&s;t unlike to them. <HI>Domitian</HI> came in as Brother to <HI>Titus. Commodus</HI> and <HI>Heliogabalus</HI> were recommended by the memory of tho&s;e Vertues that had bin found in <HI>Antoninus</HI> and <HI>Aure|lius. Honorius</HI> and <HI>Arcadius,</HI> who by their ba&s;ene&s;s brought utter ruin upon the We&s;tern and Ea&s;tern Empires, were the Sons of the brave <HI>Theo|do&s;ius.</HI> They who could keep their hands free from Blood, and their Hearts from Malice, Covetou&s;ne&s;s, and Pride, could not tran&s;mit their Vertues to their Succe&s;&s;ors, nor correct the perver&s;ene&s;s that lay at the root and foundation of their Government. The whole ma&s;s of Blood was vitia|ted: the Body was but one va&s;t Sore, which no hand but that of the Al|mighty could heal; and he who from an abhorrence of iniquity had de|clar'd he would not hear the crys of his own people, when they had cho|&s;en the thing that was not good, would not &s;hew mercy to Strangers who had done the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P>I have in&s;i&s;ted upon the <HI>Hebrew, Macedonian</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;torys, be|cau&s;e they are the mo&s;t eminent and be&s;t known to us: We are in the dark concerning the <HI>Babylonian, A&s;&s;yrian, Chaldean, Bactrian,</HI> and <HI>Egyp|tian</HI> Monarchys: We know little more of them than the Scripture occa|&s;ionally relates concerning their barbarous cruelty, be&s;tial pride, and ex|travagant folly. Others have bin like to them, and I know not where to find a peaceable Monarchy unle&s;s it be in <HI>Peru,</HI> where the <HI>Ynca Gar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ila&s;&s;o de la Vega</HI> &s;ays, that a Man and a Woman, Children of the Sun and the
<PB N="165" REF="173">
Moon, appearing among&s;t a barbarous people living without any Reli|gion   or Law, e&s;tabli&s;h'd a Government among&s;t them, which continu'd in much Peace and Ju&s;tice for twelve Generations: But this &s;eeming to be as fabulous as their Birth, we may pa&s;s it over, and fix upon tho&s;e that are better known; of which there is not one that has not &s;uffer'd more dan|gerous and mi&s;chievous Seditions, than all the popular Governments that have bin in the World: And the condition of tho&s;e Kingdoms which are not ab&s;olute, and yet give a preference to Birth, without con&s;ideration of Merit or Vertue, is not much better.</P>
<P>This is prov'd by the Rea&s;ons of tho&s;e Seditions and Tumults, as well as from the Fact it &s;elf.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;ons ari&s;e from the violence of the Pa&s;&s;ions that incite men to them, and the intricacy of the Que&s;tions concerning Succe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Every man has Pa&s;&s;ions; few know how to moderate, and no one can wholly extingui&s;h them. As they are various in their nature, &s;o they are govern'd by various Objects; and men u&s;ually follow that which is pre|dominant in them, whether it proceed from Anger or De&s;ire, and whe|ther it terminate in Ambition, Covetou&s;ne&s;s, Lu&s;t, or any other more or le&s;s blamable Appetite. Every manner of life furni&s;hes &s;omething, that in &s;ome mea&s;ure may foment the&s;e; but a Crown comprehends all that can be grateful to the mo&s;t violent and vicious. He who is covetous, has va&s;t Revenues, be&s;ides what he may get by fraud and rapine, to &s;atisfy his Appetite. If he be given to Sen&s;uality, the variety of plea&s;ures, and the facility of accompli&s;hing whatever he de&s;ires, tends farther to inflame that Pa&s;&s;ion. Such as are ambitious, are incited by the greatne&s;s of their Power to attempt great matters; and the mo&s;t &s;otti&s;h or lazy may di&s;|charge them&s;elves of Cares, and hope that others will be ea&s;ily hir'd to take the burden of Bu&s;ine&s;s upon them whil&s;t they lie at ea&s;e. They who naturally incline to pride and cruelty, are more violently tempted to u&s;urp Dominion; and the wicked Advices of Flatterers, always con|curring with their Pa&s;&s;ions, incite them to exerci&s;e the Power they have gotten with the utmo&s;t rigor, to &s;atiate their own rage, and to &s;ecure them&s;elves again&s;t the effects of the publick hatred, which they know they have de&s;erv'd. If there be, as our Author &s;ays, no other Rule than Force and Succe&s;s, and that he mu&s;t be taken for the Father of a People who is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Power over them; whoever has the one, may put the other to a trial. Nay, even tho&s;e who have regard to Ju&s;tice, will &s;eldom want Rea&s;ons to per&s;uade them that it is on their &s;ide. Something may be ami&s;s in the State; Injurys may be done to them&s;elves and their Friends. Such Honors may be deny'd as they think they de|&s;erve; or others of le&s;s Merit, as they &s;uppo&s;e, may be prefer'd before them. Men do &s;o rarely make a right e&s;timate of their own Merits, that tho&s;e who mean well may be often deceiv'd: and if nothing but Succe&s;s be requir'd to make a Monarch, they may think it ju&s;t to attempt whatever they can hope to accompli&s;h. This was the ca&s;e of <HI>Julius Cae|&s;ar;</HI> he thought all things <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Viribus utendum e&s;t quas fecimus: arma cenenti</L>

The&s;e Enterprizes &s;eem to belong to men of great Spirits; but there are none &s;o ba&s;e not to be capable of un|dertaking, and (as things may &s;tand) of bringing 'em to perfection. Hi|&s;tory

  repre&s;ents no man under a more contemptible character of &s;otti&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Lazine&s;s, Cowardice, and Drunkenne&s;s, than <HI>Vitellius;</HI> no one more impure and &s;ordid than <HI>Galba: Otho</HI> was advanc'd for being in his man|ners like to <HI>Nero: Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI> was &s;corn'd for his Avarice, till the Power fell into &s;uch hands as made the world believe none could be unworthy of the Empire; and in the following Ages the wor&s;t men by the wor&s;t means mo&s;t frequently obtain'd it.</P>
<P>The&s;e Wounds are not cur'd by &s;aying, that the Law of God and Na|ture prevents this mi&s;chief, by annexing the Succe&s;&s;ion of Crowns to proximity of Blood; for mankind had not bin continually afflicted with them if there had bin &s;uch a Law, or that they could have bin prevent|ed by it: and tho there were &s;uch a Law, yet more Que&s;tions would a|ri&s;e about that Proximity, than any wi&s;e man would dare to determin. The Law can be of no effect, unle&s;s there be a Power to decide the Con|te&s;ts ari&s;ing upon it: But the fundamental Maxim of the great Monar|chys is, that there can be no <HI>Interregnum:</HI> The Heir of the Crown is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as &s;oon as he who did injoy it is dead. <HI>Le Mort,</HI> as the <HI>French</HI> &s;ay, <HI>Sai&s;it le vif:</HI> There can be therefore no &s;uch Law, or it &s;erves for nothing. If there be Judges to interpret the Law, no man is a King till judgment be given in his favor; and he is not King by his own Title, but by the Sentence given by them. If there be none, the Law is merely imaginary, and every man may in his own ca&s;e make it what he plea&s;es. He who has a Crown in his view, and Arms in his hand, wants nothing but &s;ucce&s;s to make him a King; and if he pro&s;pers, all men are oblig'd to obey him.</P>
<P>'Tis a folly to &s;ay the matter is clear, and needs no deci&s;ion; for every man knows that no Law concerning privat Inheritances can be &s;o exactly drawn, but many Controver&s;ys will ari&s;e upon it, that mu&s;t be decided by a Power to which both Partys are &s;ubject: and the di&s;putes concerning Kingdoms are &s;o much the more difficult, becau&s;e this Law is no where to be found; and the more dangerous, becau&s;e the Competitors are for the mo&s;t part more powerful.</P>
<P>Again, this Law mu&s;t either be general to all Mankind, or particular to each Nation. If particular, a matter of &s;uch importance requires good proof, when, where, how, and by whom it was given to every one. But the Scriptures te&s;tifying to the contrary, that God gave Laws to the <HI>Jews</HI> only, and that no &s;uch thing as hereditary Monarchy, ac|cording to proximity of Blood, was pre&s;crib'd by them, we may &s;afely &s;ay, that God never gave any &s;uch Law to every particular, nor to any Nation. If he did not give it to any one, he did not give it to all, for eve|ry one is comprehended in all; and if no one has it, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible that all can have it; or that it &s;hould be obligatory to all, when no man knows or can tell, when, where, and by what hand it was given, nor what is the &s;en&s;e of it: all which is evident by the various Laws and Cu&s;toms of Nations in the di&s;po&s;al of hereditary Succe&s;&s;ions: And no one of them, that we know, has to this day bin able to &s;hew that the method follow'd by them, is more according to nature than that of others.</P>
<P>If our Author pretends to be God's Interpreter, and to give the &s;olu|tion of the&s;e doubts, I may ask which of the five following ways are appointed by God, and then we may examin Ca&s;es re&s;ulting from them.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="175">
1. In <HI>France, Turky,</HI> and other places, the Succe&s;&s;ion comes to the   next Male, in the &s;treight elde&s;t Line, according to which the Son is pre|fer'd before the Brother of him who la&s;t enjoy'd the Crown, (as the pre&s;ent King of <HI>France</HI> before his Uncle the Duke of <HI>Orleans)</HI> and the Son of the elde&s;t before the Brothers of the elde&s;t; as in the ca&s;e of <HI>Richard</HI> the Second of <HI>England,</HI> who was advanc'd preferably to all the Brothers of the black Prince his Father.</P>
<P>2. Others keep to the Males of the reigning Family, yet have more regard to the elde&s;t Man than to the elde&s;t Line: and Repre&s;entation tak|ing no place among them, the elde&s;t Man is thought to be neare&s;t to the fir&s;t King; and a &s;econd Son of the Per&s;on that la&s;t reign'd, to be nearer to him than his Grandchild by the elde&s;t Son: according to which Rule, any one of the Sons of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third remaining after his death, &s;hould have bin prefer'd before <HI>Richard</HI> the Second who was his Grand|child.</P>
<P>3. In the two ca&s;es beforemention'd, no manner of regard is had to Fe|males, who being thought naturally uncapable of commanding Men, or performing the Functions of a Magi&s;trate, are, together with their De|&s;cendents, utterly excluded from the &s;upreme as well as from the inferior Magi&s;tracys; and in <HI>Turky, France,</HI> and other great Kingdoms, have no pretence to any Title: But in &s;ome places, and particularly in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> the advantages of Proximity belong to them as well as to Males; by which means our Crown has bin tran&s;ported to &s;everal Familys and Nations.</P>
<P>4. As in &s;ome places they are utterly rejected, and in others receiv'd &s;imply without any condition; &s;o tho&s;e are not wanting, where that of not marrying out of the Country, or without the con&s;ent of the E&s;tates, is impos'd, of which <HI>Sweden</HI> is an Example.</P>
<P>5. In &s;ome places Proximity of Blood is only regarded, whether the I&s;&s;ue be legitimate, or illegitimate; in others Ba&s;tards are wholly ex|cluded.</P>
<P>By this variety of Judgments made by &s;everal Nations upon this Point, it may appear, that tho it were agreed by all that the next in Blood ought to &s;ucceed, yet &s;uch Conte&s;ts would ari&s;e upon the interpretation and ap|plication of the general Rule, as mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be a perpetual Spring of irreconcilable and mortal Quarrels.</P>
<P>If any man &s;ay, The Rule ob&s;erv'd in <HI>England</HI> is that which God gave to Mankind; I leave him fir&s;t to di&s;pute that point with the Kings of <HI>France,</HI> and many others, who can have no right to the Crowns they wear, if it be admitted; and in the next place to prove that our Ance|&s;tors had a more immediate communication with God, and a more certain knowledg of his Will than others, who for any thing we know, may be of Authority equal to them: But in the mean time we may rationally conclude, that if there be &s;uch a Rule, we have had no King in <HI>England</HI> for the &s;pace of almo&s;t a thou&s;and years, having not had one who did not come to the Crown by a mo&s;t manife&s;t violation of it; as appears by the forecited Examples of <HI>William</HI> the Fir&s;t and Second; <HI>Henry</HI> the Fir&s;t; <HI>Henry</HI> the Second and his Children; <HI>John, Edward</HI> the Third, <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth and his Children; <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, and all that claim under any of them. And if Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or Succe&s;s can give a right, it will I think follow, that <HI>Jack Straw, Wat Tyler, Perkin War|beck,</HI> or any other Ra&s;cal, might have had it if he had bin as happy as bold in his Enterprize. This is no le&s;s than to expo&s;e Crowns to the fir&s;t
<PB N="168" REF="176">
  that can &s;eize them, to de&s;troy all Law and Rule, and to render Right a &s;lave to Fortune. If this be &s;o, a late Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> who&s;e under|&s;tanding was not thought great, judg'd rightly when he &s;aid his Grandfa|ther was a wi&s;e man tho he could neither write nor read, in as much as he re&s;olv'd to follow the Crown, tho it were upon a Coal&s;taff. But if this be &s;ufficient to make a wi&s;e man, 'tis pity the &s;ecret was no &s;ooner di&s;co|ver'd, &s;ince many, who for want of it liv'd and dy'd in all the infamy that ju&s;tly accompanys Knavery, Cowardice and Folly, might have gain'd the reputation of the mo&s;t excellent Men in their &s;everal ages. The bloody Factions with which all Nations &s;ubject to this &s;ort of Mo|narchy have bin perpetually vex'd, might have bin prevented by throw|ing up cro&s;s or pile, or by battel between the Competitors body to body, as was done by <HI>Corbis</HI> and <HI>Or&s;ua, Cleore&s;tes</HI> and <HI>Polinices, Iron&s;ide</HI> and <HI>Canutus;</HI> it being mo&s;t unrea&s;onable, or rather impiou&s;ly ab&s;urd, for any to venture their Lives and Fortunes, when their Con&s;ciences are not concern'd in the Conte&s;t, and that they are to gain nothing by the Victory.</P>
<P>If Rea&s;on teaches, that till this expeditious way of ending Controver|&s;ys be receiv'd, the Ambition of men will be apt to imbroil Nations in their Quarrels; and others judging variou&s;ly of tho&s;e matters, which can be reduc'd to no certain Rule, will think them&s;elves in Con&s;cience oblig'd to follow the party that &s;eems to them to be mo&s;t ju&s;t: Experience mani|fe&s;ts the &s;ame, and that Ambition has produc'd more violent mi&s;chiefs than all the other de&s;ires and pa&s;&s;ions that have ever po&s;&s;e&s;t the hearts of men. That this may appear, it will not be ami&s;s to divide the&s;e mi&s;chiefs, into &s;uch as proceed from him who is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Power, thro jea|lou&s;y of State, as they call it, to prevent the enterprizes of tho&s;e who would di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s him, and &s;uch as ari&s;e between Competitors contending for it.</P>
<P><HI>Tarquin</HI>'s Coun&s;el concerning the Poppys, and <HI>Periander</HI>'s heads of Corn, are of the fir&s;t &s;ort. The mo&s;t eminent are always mo&s;t fear'd, as the readie&s;t to undertake, and mo&s;t able to accompli&s;h great De&s;igns. This eminence proceeds from Birth, Riches, Vertue, or Reputation, and is &s;ometimes wrought up to the greate&s;t height by a conjunction of all the&s;e. But I know not where to find an example of &s;uch a man, who could long &s;ub&s;i&s;t under Ab&s;olute Monarchy. If he be of high Birth, he mu&s;t, like <HI>Brutus,</HI> conceal his Vertue, and gain no reputation, or re|&s;olve to peri&s;h, if he do not prevent his own death by that of the Ty|rant: All other ways are ineffectual; the &s;u&s;picions, fears and hatred thereupon ari&s;ing, are not to be remov'd: Per&s;onal re&s;pects are forgotten, and &s;uch &s;ervices as cannot be &s;ufficiently valu'd, mu&s;t be blotted out by the death of tho&s;e who did them. Various ways may be taken, and pre|tences us'd according to the temper of Times and Nations; but the thing mu&s;t be done; and whether it be colour'd by a trick of Law, or per|form'd by a Mute with a Bow&s;tring, imports little. <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth was made King by the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and his brave Son <HI>Hot|&s;pur; Edward</HI> the fourth by the valiant Earl of <HI>Warwick; Henry</HI> the &s;e|venth by <HI>Stanley:</HI> but neither of 'em could think him&s;elf &s;afe, till his Benefactor was dead. No continu'd fidelity, no te&s;timonys of mode&s;ty and humility can prevent this. The mode&s;ty of <HI>Germanicus</HI> in rejecting the Honors that were offer'd to him, and his indu&s;try in quieting the mu|tiny'd Legions, accelerated his ruin: When 'twas evident he might be Emperor if he pleas'd, he mu&s;t be &s;o, or die: There was no middle &s;tati|on

'Tis probable that <HI>Caligula, Nero,</HI> and other Bea&s;ts like to them, might hate Vertue for the good which is in it; but I cannot think that either they, their Predece&s;&s;ors or Succe&s;&s;ors, would have put them&s;elves upon the de&s;perate de&s;ign of extir|pating it, if they had not found it to be incon&s;i&s;tent with their Govern|ment; and that being once concluded, they &s;par'd none of their neare&s;t Relations. <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> kill'd his Son <HI>Darius: Herod</HI> murder'd the be&s;t of his Wives, and all his Sons except the wor&s;t. <HI>Tiberius</HI> de&s;troy'd <HI>Agrippa Po&s;tuhmus,</HI> and <HI>Germanicus</HI> with his Wife and two Sons.

For after his death the mi&s;erable Nations &s;uf|fer'd as much &s;rom the madne&s;s of his Sons, as they had done by him&s;elf and his Brothers. They had learn'd from their Predece&s;&s;ors not to be &s;low in doing mi&s;chief, but were farther incited by the rage of two infa|mous Strumpets, <HI>Fredegonde</HI> and <HI>Brunehaud,</HI> which is a &s;ort of Vermin that, I am inclin'd to think, has not u&s;ually govern'd Senats or Popular A&s;&s;emblys. <HI>Chilperic</HI> the &s;econd, who by the &s;laughter of many Per&s;ons of the Royal Blood, with infinite numbers of the Nobility and People, came to be Ma&s;ter of &s;o much of the Country as procur'd him the name of King of <HI>France,</HI> kill'd his elde&s;t Son on &s;u&s;picion he was excited a|gain&s;t him by <HI>Brunehaud,</HI> and his &s;econd, le&s;t he &s;hould revenge the death of his Brother: he marry'd <HI>Fredegonde,</HI> and was &s;oon after kill'd by her Adulterer <HI>Landry.</HI> The Kingdom continu'd in the &s;ame mi&s;ery thro the rage of the &s;urviving Princes, and found no relief, tho mo&s;t of 'em fell by the Sword; and that <HI>Brunehaud</HI> who had bin a principal Cau&s;e of tho&s;e Tragedys, was ty'd to the tails of four wild Hor&s;es, and &s;uffer'd a death as foul as her life. The&s;e were Lions and Leopards. They in|volv'd the Kingdom in de&s;perate troubles; but being Men of valor and indu&s;try, they kept up in &s;ome mea&s;ure the Reputation and Power of the Nation, and he who attain'd to the Crown defended it. But they being fallen by the hands of each other, the poi&s;onous Root put forth another Plague more mortal than their Fury. The vigor was &s;pent, and the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion becoming more &s;ettled, ten ba&s;e and &s;lothful Kings, by the <HI>French</HI> called <HI>Les Roys faineans,</HI> &s;ucceeded. Some may &s;ay, They who do no|thing, do no hurt; but the Rule is fal&s;e in relation to Kings. He that takes upon him the Government of a People, can do no greater evil than by doing nothing, nor be guilty of a more unpardonable Crime, than by Negligence, Cowardice, Voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, and Sloth, to de&s;ert his charge. Vertue and Manhood peri&s;h under him; good Di&s;ciplin is for|gotten; Ju&s;tice &s;lighted; the Laws perverted or render'd u&s;ele&s;s; the People corrupted; the publick Trea&s;ures exhau&s;ted; and the Power of the Government always falling into the hands of Flatterers, Whores, Favorites, Bauds, and &s;uch ba&s;e Wretches as render it contemptible, a way is laid open for all manner of di&s;orders. The greate&s;t cruelty that has bin known in the world, if accompany'd with wit and courage, never did &s;o much hurt as this &s;lothful be&s;tiality; or rather the&s;e &s;lothful Bea&s;ts have ever bin mo&s;t cruel. The Reigns of <HI>Septimius Severus, Ma|homet</HI> the &s;econd, or <HI>Selim</HI> the &s;econd, were cruel and bloody; but their fury was turn'd again&s;t Foreigners, and &s;ome of their near Rela|tions, or again&s;t &s;uch as fell under the &s;u&s;picion of making attempts again&s;t them: The condition of the People was tolerable; tho&s;e who would be quiet might be &s;afe; the Laws kept their right cour&s;e; the Re|putation of the Empire was maintain'd, the Limits defended, and the publick Peace pre&s;erv'd. But when the Sword pa&s;t into the hands of leud, &s;lothful, fooli&s;h, and cowardly Princes, it was of no power again&s;t foreign Enemys, or the di&s;turbers of dome&s;tic Peace, tho always &s;harp again&s;t the be&s;t of their own Subjects. No man knew how to &s;ecure him&s;elf again&s;t them, unle&s;s by rai&s;ing civil Wars; which will always be &s;requent, when a Crown defended by a weak hand is propos'd as a Prize to any that dare invade it. This is a perpetual Spring of di&s;orders; and no Nation was ever quiet, when the mo&s;t eminent men found le&s;s danger in the mo&s;t violent Attempts, than in &s;ubmitting patiently to the
<PB N="171" REF="179">
Will of a Prince, that &s;uffers his Power to be manag'd by vile Per&s;ons,   who get credit by flattering him in his Vices. But this is not all; &s;uch Princes naturally hate and fear tho&s;e who excel them in Vertue and Re|putation, as much as they are inferior to them in Fortune; and think their Per&s;ons cannot be &s;ecur'd, nor their Authority enlarg'd, except by their de&s;truction. 'Tis ordinary for them, <HI>inter &s;corta &amp; ganeas prin|cipibus</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">C. Tacit.</NOTE><HI>viris perniciem machinare,</HI> and to make Cruelty a cover to Igno|rance and Cowardice. Be&s;ides the Mi&s;chiefs brought upon the Publick by the lo&s;s of eminent Men, who are the Pillars of every State, &s;uch Reigns are always accompany'd with Tumults and Civil Wars, the great Men &s;triving with no le&s;s violence who &s;hall get the weak Prince into his power, when &s;uch regard is had to &s;ucce&s;&s;ion that they think it not fit to deve&s;t him of the Title, than when with le&s;s re&s;pect they contend for the Sovereignty it &s;elf. And whil&s;t this &s;ort of Princes reign'd, <HI>France</HI> was not le&s;s afflicted with the Conte&s;ts between <HI>Grimbauld, Ebroin, Grimoald,</HI> and others, for the Mayoralty of the Palace, than they had bin before by the rage of tho&s;e Princes who had conte&s;ted for the Crown. The I&s;&s;ue al&s;o was the &s;ame: After many Re|volutions, <HI>Charles Martel</HI> gain'd the Power of the Kingdom, which he had &s;o bravely defended again&s;t the <HI>Saracens;</HI> and having tran&s;mitted it to his Son <HI>Pepin,</HI> the General A&s;&s;embly of E&s;tates, with the approbation of Mankind, confer'd the Title al&s;o upon him. This gave the Nation ea&s;e for the pre&s;ent; but the deep-rooted Evil could not be &s;o cur'd; and the Kingdom, that by the Wi&s;dom, Valor, and Reputation of <HI>Pepin,</HI> had bin pre&s;erv'd from civil Troubles during his life, fell as deeply as ever into them &s;o &s;oon as he was dead. His Sons, <HI>Carloman</HI> and <HI>Charles,</HI> di|vided the Dominions, but in a little time each of them would have all. <HI>Carloman</HI> fill'd the Kingdom with Tumult; rais'd the <HI>Lombards,</HI> and march'd with a great Army again&s;t his Brother, till his cour&s;e was inter|rupted by death, caus'd, as is &s;uppos'd, by &s;uch helps as Princes liberally afford to their a&s;piring Relations. <HI>Charles</HI> depriv'd his two Sons of their Inheritance, put them in Pri&s;on, and we hear no more of them. His third Brother <HI>Griffon</HI> was not more quiet, nor more &s;ucce&s;sful; and there could be no Peace in <HI>Ga&s;cony, Italy,</HI> or <HI>Germany,</HI> till he was kill'd. But all the Advantages which <HI>Charles,</HI> by an extraordinary Vertue and Fortune, had purchas'd for his Country, ended with his Life. He left his Son <HI>Lewis</HI> the <HI>Gentle</HI> in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Empire, and Kingdom of <HI>France,</HI> and his Grand&s;on <HI>Bernard</HI> King of <HI>Italy:</HI> But the&s;e two could not agree, and <HI>Bernard</HI> falling into the hands of <HI>Lewis,</HI> was depriv'd of his Eyes, and &s;ome time after kill'd. This was not enough to pre&s;erve the Peace: <HI>Lothair, Lewis</HI> and <HI>Pepin,</HI> all three Sons to <HI>Lewis,</HI> rebel'd again&s;t him; call'd a Council at <HI>Lions,</HI> depos'd him, and divided the Empire among&s;t them&s;elves. After five years he e&s;cap'd from the Mona&s;tery where he had bin kept, renew'd the War, and was again taken Pri&s;oner by <HI>Lo|thair.</HI> When he was dead, the War broke out more fiercely than ever between his Children: <HI>Lothair</HI> the Fmperor a&s;&s;aulted <HI>Lewis</HI> King of <HI>Ba|varia</HI> and <HI>Charles</HI> King of <HI>Rhetia;</HI> was defeated by them, and confin'd to a Mona&s;tery, where he dy'd. New Quarrels aro&s;e between the two Brothers, upon the divi&s;ion of the Countrys taken from him, and <HI>Lor|rain</HI> only was le&s;t to his Son. <HI>Lewis</HI> dy'd &s;oon after, and <HI>Charles</HI> getting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Empire and Kingdom, ended an inglorious Reign in an unpro&s;perous attempt to deprive <HI>Hermingrade,</HI> Daughter to his Brother <HI>Lewis,</HI> of the Kingdom of <HI>Arles,</HI> and other places left to her by her Fa|ther.
<PB N="172" REF="180">
  <HI>Lewis</HI> his Son, call'd the <HI>Stutterer,</HI> reign'd two years in much trouble; and his only legitimate Son, <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>Simple,</HI> came not to the Crown till after the death of his two Ba&s;tard Brothers, <HI>Lewis</HI> and <HI>Carlo|man, Charles le Gros,</HI> and <HI>Eudes</HI> Duke of <HI>Anjou. Charles le Gros</HI> was depos'd from the Empire and Kingdom, &s;trip'd of his Goods, and left to peri&s;h thro poverty in an ob&s;cure Village. <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>Simple,</HI> and the Nations under him, thriv'd no better: <HI>Robert</HI> Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> rais'd War again&s;t him, and was crown'd at <HI>Rheims;</HI> but was him&s;elf &s;lain &s;oon af|ter in a bloody battel near <HI>Soi&s;&s;ons.</HI> His Son-in-law, <HI>Hebert</HI> Earl of <HI>Ver|mandois,</HI> gather'd up the remains of his &s;catter'd Party, got <HI>Charles</HI> into his power, and call'd a General A&s;&s;embly of E&s;tates, who depos'd him, and gave the Crown to <HI>Raoul</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgundy;</HI> tho he was no other|wi&s;e related to the Royal Blood than by his Mother, which in <HI>France</HI> is nothing at all. He being dead, <HI>Lewis</HI> Son to the depos'd <HI>Charles</HI> was made King; but his Reign was as inglorious to him, as mi&s;erable to his Subjects. This is the Peace which the <HI>French</HI> enjoy'd for the &s;pace of five or &s;ix Ages under their Monarchy; and 'tis hard to determin whether they &s;uffer'd mo&s;t by the Violence of tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;t, or the Ambition of others who a&s;pir'd to the Crown; and whether the fury of active, or the ba&s;ene&s;s of &s;lothful Princes was mo&s;t pernicious to them: But upon the whole matter, thro the defects of tho&s;e of the latter &s;ort, they lo&s;t all they had gain'd by &s;weat and blood under the conduct of the former. <HI>Henry</HI> and <HI>Otho</HI> of <HI>Saxony,</HI> by a Vertue like that of <HI>Charlemagne,</HI> depriv'd them of the Empire, and &s;ettled it in <HI>Germany,</HI> leaving <HI>France</HI> only to <HI>Lewis</HI> &s;irnam'd <HI>Outremer,</HI> and his Son <HI>Lothair.</HI> The&s;e &s;eem'd to be e|qually compos'd of Treachery, Cruelty, Ambition, and Ba&s;ene&s;s: They were always mutinous, and always beaten: Their frantick Pa&s;&s;ions put 'em always upon unju&s;t de&s;igns, and were &s;uch plagues to their Subjects and Neighbours, that they became equally dete&s;ted and de&s;pis'd. The&s;e things extingui&s;h'd the veneration due to the memory of <HI>Pepin</HI> and <HI>Charles;</HI> and oblig'd the whole Nation rather to &s;eek relief from a Stranger, than to be ruin'd by their worthle&s;s De&s;cendents. They had try'd all ways that were in their power, depos'd four crowned Kings within the &s;pace of a hundred and fifty years; crown'd five who had no other Title than the People confer'd upon them, and re&s;tor'd the De&s;cen|dents of tho&s;e they had rejected, but all was in vain: Their Vices were incorrigible, the Mi&s;chiefs produc'd by them intolerable; they never ceas'd from murdering one another in battel, or by treachery, and bring|ing the Nation into Civil Wars upon their wicked or fooli&s;h Quarrels, till the whole Race was rejected, and the Crown plac'd upon the head of <HI>Hugh Capet.</HI> The&s;e Mi&s;chie&s;s rag'd not in the &s;ame extremity under him and his De&s;cendents, but the abatement proceeded from a cau&s;e no way advantageous to Ab&s;olute Monarchy. The <HI>French</HI> were by their Cala|mitys taught more &s;trictly to limit the Regal Power; and by turning the Dukedoms and Earldoms into Patrimonys, which had bin Offices, gave an Authority to the chief of the Nobility, by which that of Kings was curb'd; and tho by this means the Commonalty were expos'd to &s;ome Pre&s;&s;ures, yet they were &s;mall in compari&s;on of what they had &s;uffer'd in &s;ormer times. When many great Men had E&s;tates of their own that did not depend upon the Will of Kings, they grew to love their Coun|try; and tho they chearfully &s;erv'd the Crown in all ca&s;es of publick Concernment, they were not ea&s;ily engag'd in the per&s;onal quarrels of tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;t it, or had a mind to gain it.

in this condition, they were oblig'd to u&s;e their Va&s;&s;als gently; and this   continuing in &s;ome mea&s;ure till within the la&s;t fifty years, the Monarchy was le&s;s tumultuous, than when the King's Will had bin le&s;s re&s;train'd. Neverthele&s;s they had not much rea&s;on to boa&s;t; there was a Root &s;till remaining, that from time to time produc'd poi&s;onous Fruit: Civil Wars were frequent among them, tho not carry'd on with &s;uch de&s;perate mad|ne&s;s as formerly; and many of them upon the account of di&s;putes be|tween Competitors for the Crown. All the Wars with <HI>England,</HI> &s;ince <HI>Ed|ward</HI> the Second marry'd <HI>I&s;abella</HI> Daughter, and, as he pretended, Heir of <HI>Philip Le Bel,</HI> were of this nature. The defeats of <HI>Crecy, Poitiers,</HI> and <HI>Agincourt,</HI> with the &s;laughters and deva&s;tations &s;uffer'd from <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, the black Prince, and <HI>Henry</HI> the Fifth, were merely upon Con|te&s;ts for the Crown. The Factions of <HI>Orleans</HI> and <HI>Burgundy, Orleans</HI> and <HI>Armagnac,</HI> proceeded from the &s;ame Spring; and the Murders that &s;eem to have bin the immediate cau&s;es of tho&s;e Quarrels, were only the effects of the hatred growing from their competition.

Our own Age furni&s;hes us with more than one attempt of the &s;ame kind, attended with the like &s;ucce&s;s. The Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> was &s;everal times in arms again&s;t <HI>Lewis</HI> the 13<HI>th</HI> his Brother; the Queen-mother drew the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to favour him; <HI>Montmorency</HI> pe|ri&s;h'd in his Quarrel; <HI>Fontrailles</HI> reviv'd it by a Treaty with <HI>Spain,</HI> which &s;truck at the King's head as well as the Cardinal's, and was &s;uppre&s;t by the death of <HI>Cinq Mars</HI> and <HI>de Thou.</HI> Tho&s;e who under&s;tand the Affairs of that Kingdom, make no doubt that the Count <HI>de Soi&s;&s;ons</HI> would have &s;et up for him&s;elf, and bin follow'd by the be&s;t part of <HI>France,</HI> if he had not bin kill'd in the pur&s;uit of his Victory at the Battel of <HI>Sedan.</HI> Since that time the Kingdom has &s;uffer'd &s;uch Di&s;turbances as &s;how, that more was intended than the removal of <HI>Mazarin:</HI> And the <HI>Marechal de Turenne</HI> was often told, that the check he gave to the Prince of <HI>Cond&eacute;</HI> at <HI>Gien,</HI> af|ter he had defeated <HI>Hocquincourt,</HI> had pre&s;erv'd the Crown upon the King's Head. And to te&s;tify the Stability, good Order, and dome&s;tick Peace that accompanys Ab&s;olute Monarchy, we have in our own days &s;een the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon</HI> often divided within it &s;elf; the Duke of <HI>Or|leans,</HI> the Count <HI>de Soi&s;&s;ons,</HI> and the Princes of <HI>Cond&eacute;</HI> and <HI>Conti</HI> in war again&s;t the King; the Dukes of <HI>Angoule&s;me, Vendome, Longueville,</HI> the Count <HI>de Moret,</HI> and other Ba&s;tards of the Royal Family, following their example; the Hou&s;es of <HI>Gui&s;e, D' Elbeuf, Bouillon, Nemours, Rochefo|cault,</HI> and almo&s;t all the mo&s;t eminent in <HI>France,</HI> with the Parliaments of <HI>Paris, Bourdeaux,</HI> and &s;ome others, joining with them.

<P>But the Mi&s;erys of <HI>England,</HI> upon the like occa&s;ions, &s;urpa&s;s all. <HI>Wil|liam</HI> the <HI>Norman</HI> was no &s;ooner dead, but the Nation was rent in pieces by his elde&s;t Son <HI>Robert,</HI> conte&s;ting with his younger Sons <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> for the Crown. They being all dead and their Sons, the like hap|pen'd between <HI>Stephen</HI> and <HI>Maud: Henry</HI> the Second was made King to terminate all Di&s;putes, but it prov'd a fruitle&s;s Expedient: Such as were more &s;candalous, and not le&s;s dangerous, did &s;oon ari&s;e between him and his Sons; who be&s;ides the Evils brought upon the Nation, vex'd him to death by their Rebellion. The Reigns of <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the Third were yet more tempe&s;tuous. <HI>Edward</HI> the Second's leud, fooli&s;h, infa|mous and dete&s;table Government, ended in his depo&s;ition and death, to which he was brought by his Wife and Son. <HI>Edward</HI> the Third em|ploy'd his own and his Subjects Valor again&s;t the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Scots;</HI> but whil&s;t the Foundations were out of order, the Nation could never re|ceive any advantage by their Victorys: All was calculated for the Glory, and turn'd to the Advantage of one Man. He being dead, all that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> held in <HI>Scotland</HI> and in <HI>France,</HI> was lo&s;t thro the ba&s;ene&s;s of his Succe&s;&s;or, with more Blood than it had bin gain'd; and the Civil Wars rais'd by his wickedne&s;s and madne&s;s, ended as tho&s;e of <HI>Edward</HI> the Se|cond had done.

Vertue and Victorys, that none dar'd to invade the Crown during his   life; but immediately after his death the Storms prepar'd again&s;t his Fa|mily, broke out with the utmo&s;t violence. His Son's weakne&s;s encou|rag'd <HI>Richard</HI> Duke of <HI>York</HI> to &s;et up a new Title, which produc'd &s;uch Mi&s;chiefs as hardly any People have &s;uffer'd, unlefs upon the like occa&s;i|on: For be&s;ides the &s;laughter of many thou&s;ands of the People, and e&s;pe|cially of tho&s;e who had bin accu&s;tom'd to Arms, the deva&s;tation of the be&s;t parts of the Kingdom, and the lo&s;s of all that our Kings had inhe|rited in <HI>France,</HI> or gain'd by the blood of their Subjects, four&s;core Prin|ces of the Blood, as <HI>Philip de Commines</HI> calls them, dy'd in Battel, or under the hand of the Hangman. Many of the mo&s;t noble Familys were extingui&s;h'd; others lo&s;t their mo&s;t eminent Men. Three Kings and two pre&s;umptive Heirs of the Crown were murder'd, and the Na|tion brought to that &s;hameful exigence, to &s;et up a young Man to reign over them, who had no better cover for his &s;ordid extraction than a Welch Pedegree, that might &s;hew how a Tailor was de&s;cended from Prince <HI>Arthur, Cadwallader</HI> and <HI>Brutus.</HI> But the Wounds of the Nation were not to be heal'd with &s;uch a Plai&s;ter. He could not rely upon a Title made up of &s;uch &s;tuff, and patch'd with a Marriage to a Prince&s;s of a very que&s;tionable Birth. His own meanne&s;s inclin'd him to hate the Nobility; and thinking it to be as ea&s;y for them to take the Crown from him, as to give it to him, he indu&s;triou&s;ly apply'd him&s;elf to glean up the Remainders of the Hou&s;e of <HI>York,</HI> from whence a Competitor might ari&s;e, and by all means to cru&s;h tho&s;e who were mo&s;t able to oppo&s;e him. This exceedingly weaken'd the Nobility, who held the Balance between him and the Commons, and was a great &s;tep towards the di&s;&s;o|lution of our antient Government: but he was &s;o far from &s;ettling the Kingdom in peace, that &s;uch Ra&s;cals as <HI>Perkin Warbeck</HI> and <HI>Simnel</HI> were able to di&s;turb it. The Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth was turbulent and bloody; that of <HI>Mary</HI> furious, and &s;uch as had brought us into &s;ubjection to the mo&s;t powerful, proud and cruel Nation at that time in the World, if God had not wonderfully protected us. Nay, <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth, and Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the natural excellency of their Di&s;po|&s;itions, and their knowledg of the Truth in matters of Religion, were forc'd, by that which men call <HI>Jealou&s;y of State,</HI> to foul their hands &s;o of|ten with illu&s;trious Blood, that if their Reigns de&s;erve to be accounted a|mong&s;t the mo&s;t gentle of Monarchys, they were more heavy than the Government of any Commonwealth; and yet their Lives were ne|ver &s;ecure again&s;t &s;uch as con&s;pir'd again&s;t them upon the account of Title.</P>
<P>Having in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;hew'd what Mi&s;erys have bin u&s;ually, if not perpetually brought upon Nations &s;ubject to Monarchys by the violence of &s;ome Princes, and the ba&s;ene&s;s, folly, and cowardice of others, toge|ther with what they have &s;uffer'd in Conte&s;ts for the &s;everal Crowns, whil&s;t men divided into divers Factions, &s;trive with as much vehemen|cy to advance the Per&s;on they favour, as if they or their Country were intere&s;ted in the quarrel; and fight as fiercely for a Ma&s;ter as they might rea&s;onably do to have none; I am not able to determin which of the two Evils is the mo&s;t mortal. 'Tis evident the Vices of Princes re&s;ult to the Damage of the People; but whether Pride and Cruelty, or Stupidity and Sloth be the wor&s;t, I cannot tell. All Monarchys are &s;ubject to be afflicted with Civil Wars: but whether the mo&s;t frequent and bloody do ari&s;e from the quarrels of divers Competitors for Crowns before any one

  gain the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, or afterwards thro the fears of him that would keep what he has gain'd, or the rage of tho&s;e who would wre&s;t it from him, is not &s;o ea&s;ily decided. But Commonwealths are le&s;s trou|bled with tho&s;e Di&s;tempers. Women, Children, or &s;uch as are notoriou&s;|ly fooli&s;h or mad, are never advanc'd to the Supreme Power. Whil&s;t the Laws, and that Di&s;ciplin which nouri&s;hes Vertue is in force, Men of Wi&s;dom and Valor are never wanting; and every man de&s;ires to give te&s;timony of his Vertue, when he knows 'twill be rewarded with Ho|nor and Power. If unworthy Per&s;ons creep into Magi&s;tracys, or are by mi&s;take any way prefer'd, their Vices for the mo&s;t part turn to their own hurt; and the State cannot ea&s;ily receive any great damage by the incapa|city of one who is not to continue in Office above a year; and is u&s;ually encompa&s;t with tho&s;e who having born, or are a&s;piring to the &s;ame, are by their Vertue able to &s;upply his defects; cannot hope for a Reward from one unable to corrupt 'em, and are &s;ure of the favor of the Senat and Peo|ple to &s;upport 'em in the defence of the publick Intere&s;t. As long as this good Order continues, private Quarrels are &s;uppre&s;t by the Authority of the Magi&s;trate, or prove to be of little effect. Such as ari&s;e between the Nobles and Commons frequently produce good Laws for the maintenance of Liberty, as they did in <HI>Rome</HI> for above three hundred years after the expul&s;ion of <HI>Tarquin;</HI> and almo&s;t ever terminate with little or no blood. Sometimes the Errors of one or both Partys are di&s;cover'd by the di&s;cour&s;e of a wi&s;e and good Man; and tho&s;e who have mo&s;t violently oppos'd one another become the be&s;t Friends, every one joining to remove the evil that cau&s;es the divi&s;ion. When the Senat and People of <HI>Rome</HI> &s;eem'd to be mo&s;t furiou&s;ly incens'd again&s;t each other, the creation of Tribuns, communication of Honors and Marriages between the Patrician and Ple|beian Familys, or the mitigation of U&s;ury, compos'd all; and the&s;e were not only harmle&s;s things, but &s;uch as gave opportunitys of correcting the defects that had bin in the fir&s;t Con&s;titution of the Government, without which they could never have attain'd to the Greatne&s;s, Glory and Happi|ne&s;s they afterwards enjoy'd. Such as had &s;een that People meeting in tumult, running thro the City, crying out again&s;t the Kings, Con&s;uls, Senat, or <HI>Decemviri,</HI> might have thought they would have fill'd all with blood and &s;laughter; but no &s;uch thing happen'd. They de&s;ir'd no more than to take away the Kingdom which <HI>Tarquin</HI> had wickedly u|&s;urp'd; and never went about &s;o much as to puni&s;h one Mini&s;ter of the mi&s;chiefs he had done, or to take away his Goods, till upon pretence of treating, his Emba&s;&s;adors by a new Treachery had ca&s;t the City into greater danger than ever. Tho the <HI>Decemviri</HI> had by the like Villanys e|qually provok'd the People, they were us'd with the like gentlene&s;s: <HI>Appius</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">T. Liv. l. 3.</NOTE><HI>Claudius</HI> and <HI>Oppius</HI> having by voluntary death &s;ub&s;tracted them&s;elves from publick puni&s;hment, their Collegues were only bani&s;h'd, and the Magi&s;tracys of the City reduc'd to the former order, without the effu&s;ion of more blood. They who contended for their ju&s;t Rights, were &s;ati&s;|fy'd with the recovery of them; whereas &s;uch as follow the impul&s;e of an unruly Ambition, never think them&s;elves &s;afe till they have de&s;troy'd all that &s;eem able to di&s;turb them, and &s;atiated their rage with the blood of their Adver&s;arys. This makes, as well as &s;hews the difference be|tween the Tumults of <HI>Rome,</HI> or the &s;ece&s;&s;ion of the common People to Mount <HI>Aventine,</HI> and the Battels of <HI>Towton, Teuxbury, Eve&s;hal, Lewes, Hexham, Barnet, St. Albans,</HI> and <HI>Bo&s;worth.</HI> 'Tis in vain to &s;ay the&s;e ought rather to be compar'd to tho&s;e of <HI>Phar&s;alia, Actium,</HI> or <HI>Philippi;</HI>

&s;or when the Laws of a Commonwealth are aboli&s;h'd, the Name al&s;o   cea&s;es. Whatever is done by force or fraud to &s;et up the Intere&s;ts and Lu&s;ts of one man in oppo&s;ition to the Laws of his Country, is purely and ab&s;olutely Monarchical. What&s;oever pa&s;t between <HI>Marius, Sylla, Cinna, Catiline, Cae&s;ar, Pompey, Cra&s;&s;us, Augu&s;tus, Antonius,</HI> and <HI>Lepi|dus,</HI> is to be imputed to the Conte&s;ts that ari&s;e between Competitors for Monarchy, as well as tho&s;e that in the next age happen'd between <HI>Galba, Otho, Vitellius,</HI> and <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian:</HI> Or, which is wor&s;e, whereas all men in Commonwealths fight for them&s;elves when there is occa&s;ion, and if they &s;ucceed, enjoy the fruits of their Victory&punc; &s;o as even tho&s;e who remain of the vanqui&s;h'd party, partake of the Liberty thereby e&s;tabli&s;h'd, or the good Laws thereupon made; &s;uch as follow'd the En&s;igns of tho&s;e men who &s;ought to &s;et up them&s;elves, did, rather like bea&s;ts than men, hazard and &s;uffer many un&s;peakable evils to purcha&s;e mi&s;ery to them|&s;elves and their Po&s;terity, and to make one their Ma&s;ter, who increa&s;ing in Pride, Avarice, and Cruelty, was to be thrown down again with as much Blood as he had bin &s;et up.</P>
<P>The&s;e things, if I mi&s;take not, being in the la&s;t degree evident, I may leave to our Author all the advantages he can gain by his rhetorical De&s;cription of the Tumults of <HI>Rome, when Blood was in the Market-place &s;uckt up with Sponges, and the Jakes &s;tuff'd with Carca&s;es;</HI> to which he may add the crimes of <HI>Sylla</HI>'s Life, and the mi&s;erys of his Death: But withal I de&s;ire to know what number of Sponges were &s;ufficient to &s;uck up the Blood of five hundred thou&s;and men &s;lain in one day, when the Hou&s;es of <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Jeroboam</HI> contended for the Crown of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> or of four hundred thou&s;and who fell in one battel between <HI>Joa&s;h</HI> and <HI>Amaziah</HI> on the &s;ame occa&s;ion; what Jakes were capacious enough to contain the Carca&s;es of tho&s;e that peri&s;h'd in the quarrels between the Succe&s;&s;ors of <HI>Alexander,</HI> the &s;everal Competiors for the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire; or tho&s;e which happen'd in <HI>France, Spain, England,</HI> and other places upon the like occa&s;ions. If <HI>Sylla</HI> for &s;ome time acted as an ab&s;olute Monarch, 'tis no wonder that he dy'd like one, or that God puni&s;h'd him as <HI>Herod, Philip</HI> the &s;econd of <HI>Spain,</HI> and &s;ome others, becau&s;e the hand of his fellow&punc;Ci|tizens had unju&s;tly &s;par'd him.

<HEAD>SECT. XXV. Courts are more &s;ubject to Venality and Corruption than Popular Governments.</HEAD>
<P>THO Court-flatterers impute many evils to Popular Governments they no way de&s;erve, I could not think any &s;o impudent as to lay Corruption and Venality to their charge, till I found it in our Author. They might in my opinion have taken tho&s;e faults upon them&s;elves, &s;ince they certainly abound mo&s;t where Bawds, Whores, Buffoons, Players, Slaves, and other ba&s;e people who are naturally mercenary, are mo&s;t
<PB N="180" REF="186">
  prevalent. And who&s;oever would know whether this dos more frequent|ly befal Commonwealths than Monarchys, e&s;pecially if they are ab&s;olute, need only to inquire whether the <HI>Cornelii, Junii, Fabii, Valerii, Quintii, Curii, Fabritii,</HI> and others who mo&s;t prevail'd in <HI>Rome</HI> after the expul&s;ion of the Kings, or <HI>Sejanus, Macro, Narci&s;&s;us, Pallas, Icetus, Tigellinus, Vinnius, Laco, Agrippina, Me&s;&s;alina, Lollia, Poppaea,</HI> and the like, were mo&s;t &s;ubject to tho&s;e ba&s;e Vices: Whether it were more ea&s;y to corrupt one or two of tho&s;e Villains and Strumpets, or the Senats and People of <HI>Rome, Carthage, Athens,</HI> and <HI>Sparta;</HI> and whether that &s;ort of Rabble had more power over the Princes they &s;erv'd, than &s;uch as mo&s;t re&s;embled them had whil&s;t the Popular Government continu'd. 'Tis in vain to &s;ay tho&s;e Princes were wicked and vile, for many others are &s;o likewi&s;e; and when the Power is in the hands of one man, there can be no a&s;&s;urance he will not be like them. Nay, when the Power is &s;o plac'd, ill men will always find opportunitys of compa&s;&s;ing their de&s;ires: <HI>Bonus, cautus, opti|mus Imperator venditur,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Diocle&s;ian;</HI> and tho he was no unwi&s;e man, yet that which principally induc'd him to renounce the Empire, was the impo&s;&s;ibility he found of defending him&s;elf again&s;t tho&s;e that were in cre|dit with him, who daily betray'd and &s;old him. They &s;ee with the eyes of other men, and cannot re&s;i&s;t the frauds that are perpetually put upon them. <HI>Antoninus Pius</HI> and <HI>Marcus Aurelius</HI> &s;eem to have bin the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of all the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors; but the two <HI>Fau&s;tina</HI>'s had &s;uch an a&s;cendent over them, as was mo&s;t &s;hameful to their per&s;ons, and mi&s;|chievous to the Empire and the be&s;t men in it. Such as the&s;e may gain too much upon the affections of one man in the be&s;t regulated Govern|ment; but that could be of no great danger to the Publick, when many others equal, or not much inferior to him in authority, are ready to oppo&s;e whatever he &s;hould endeavour to promote by their impul&s;e: but there is no remedy when all depends upon the Will of a &s;ingle per&s;on who is go|vern'd by them. There was more of acutene&s;s and je&s;t, than of truth in that &s;aying of <HI>Themi&s;tocles, That his little boy had more power than any man in</HI> Greece; <HI>for he govern'd his Mother, &s;he him, he</HI> Athens, <HI>and</HI> Athens Greece. For he him&s;elf was found to have little power, when for private pa&s;&s;ions and concernments he departed from the intere&s;t of the Publick; and the like has bin found in all places that have bin govern'd in the like manner.</P>
<P>Again; Corruption will always reign mo&s;t, where tho&s;e who have the power do mo&s;t favour it, where the rewards of &s;uch Crimes are great|e&s;t, ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t valu'd, and where the puni&s;hment of them is lea&s;t &s;ear'd.</P>
<P>1. For the fir&s;t, we have already prov'd that Liberty cannot be pre|&s;erv'd, if the manners of the People are corrupted, nor ab&s;olute Monar|chy introduc'd where they are &s;incere; which is &s;ufficient to &s;hew that tho&s;e who manage free Governments ought always to the utmo&s;t of their power to oppo&s;e Corruption, becau&s;e otherwi&s;e both they and their Go|vernment mu&s;t inevitably peri&s;h; and that on the other hand, the ab&s;o|lute Monarch mu&s;t endeavour to introduce it, becau&s;e he cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without it. 'Tis al&s;o &s;o natural for all &s;uch Monarchs to place men in power who pretend to love their Per&s;ons, and will depend upon their plea|&s;ure, that po&s;&s;ibly 'twould be hard to find one in the world who has not made it the rule of his Government: And this is not only the way to cor|ruption, but the mo&s;t dangerous of all. For tho a good man may love a good Monarch, he will obey him only when he commands that which
<PB N="181" REF="187">
is ju&s;t; and no one can engage him&s;elf blindly to do whatever he is com|manded,   without renouncing all Vertue and Religion; becau&s;e he knows not whether that which &s;hall be commanded is con&s;i&s;tent with either, or directly contrary to the Laws of God and Man. But if &s;uch a Monarch be evil, and his Actions &s;uch as they are too o&s;ten found to be, whoever bears an affection to him, and &s;econds his de&s;igns, declares him&s;elf an Enemy to all that is good; and the advancement of &s;uch men to power dos not only introduce, foment, and increa&s;e Corruption, but fortifys it in &s;uch a manner, that without an intire renovation of that State, it can|not be remov'd. Ill men may po&s;&s;ibly creep into any Government; but when the wor&s;t are plac'd neare&s;t to the Throne, and rais'd to Honors for being &s;o, they will with that force endeavour to draw all men to a conformity of Spirit with them&s;elves, that it can no otherwi&s;e be pre|vented, than by de&s;troying them and the Principle in which they live.</P>
<P>2. To the &s;econd; Man naturally follows that which is good, or &s;eems to him to be &s;o. Hence it is that in well-govern'd States, where a value is put upon Vertue, and no one honor'd unle&s;s for &s;uch Qualitys as are be|neficial to the Publick, men are from the tendere&s;t years brought up in a belief, that nothing in this world de&s;erves to be &s;ought after, but &s;uch Honors as are acquir'd by vertuous Actions: By this means Vertue it &s;elf becomes popular, as in <HI>Sparta, Rome,</HI> and other places, where Riches (which with the Vanity that follows them, and the Honors men give to them, are the root of all evil) were either totally bani&s;h'd, or little re|garded. When no other advantage attended the greate&s;t Riches than the opportunity of living more &s;umptuou&s;ly or deliciou&s;ly, men of great Spirits &s;lighted them. When <HI>Ari&s;tippus</HI> told <HI>Cleanthes,</HI> that if he would go to Court and flatter the Tyrant, he need not &s;eek his Supper under a hedg; the Philo&s;opher an&s;wer'd, that he who could content him&s;elf with &s;uch a Supper, neednot go to Court, or flatter the Tyrant. <HI>Epaminondas, Ari&s;tides, Phocion,</HI> and even the <HI>Lacedemonian</HI> Kings, found no inconve|nience in Poverty, whil&s;t their Vertue was honor'd, and the riche&s;t Prin|ces in the world fear'd their Valor and Power. It was not difficult for <HI>Curius, Fabricius, Cincinnatus,</HI> or <HI>Emilius Paulus,</HI> to content them&s;elves with the narrowe&s;t Fortune, when it was no ob&s;tacle to them in the pur|&s;uit of tho&s;e Honors which their Vertues de&s;erv'd. 'Twas in vain to think of bribing a man who &s;up'd upon the Coleworts of his own Gar|den. He could not be gain'd by Gold, who did not think it nece&s;&s;ary. He that could ri&s;e from the Plow to the triumphal Chariot, and conten|tedly return thither again, could not be corrupted; and he that left the &s;en&s;e of his Poverty to his Executors, who found not wherewith to bury him, might leave <HI>Macedon</HI> and <HI>Greece</HI> to the pillage of his Soldiers, with|out taking to him&s;elf any part of the Booty. But when Luxury was brought into fa&s;hion, and they came to be honor'd who liv'd magnificent|ly, tho they had in them&s;elves no qualitys to di&s;tingui&s;h them from the ba&s;e&s;t of Slaves, the mo&s;t vertuous men were expos'd to &s;corn if they were poor: and that poverty which had bin the mother and nur&s;e of their Vertue, grew in&s;upportable. The Poet well under&s;tood what effect this change had upon the World, who &s;aid,

  When Riches grew to be nece&s;&s;ary, the de&s;ire of them, which is the &s;pring of all mi&s;chief, follow'd. They who could not obtain Honors by the noble&s;t Actions, were oblig'd to get Wealth, or purcha&s;e them from Whores and Villains, who expos'd them to &s;ale: and when they were once enter'd into this track, they &s;oon learn'd the Vices of tho&s;e from whom they had receiv'd their Preferment, and to delight in the ways that had brought them to it. When they were come to this, nothing could &s;top them: All thought and remembrance of good was extingui&s;h'd. They who had bought the Commands of Armys or Provinces, from <HI>Icetus</HI> or <HI>Narci&s;&s;us,</HI> &s;ought only how to draw Mony from them, to enable them to purcha&s;e higher Dignitys, or gain a more a&s;&s;ur'd protection from tho&s;e Patrons. This brought the Government of the World under a mo&s;t infamous Traf|fick; and the Trea&s;ures ari&s;ing from it were, for the mo&s;t part, di&s;&s;ipa|ted by wor&s;e vices, than the Rapine, Violence and Fraud with which they had bin gotten. The Authors of tho&s;e Crimes had nothing left but their Crimes, and the nece&s;&s;ity of committing more, thro the indigence into which they were plung'd by the extravagance of their Expences. The&s;e things are in&s;eparable from the life of a Courtier: for as &s;ervile Natures are guid|ed rather by &s;en&s;e than rea&s;on, &s;uch as addict them&s;elves to the &s;ervice of Courts, find no other con&s;olation in their mi&s;ery, than what they receive from &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures, or &s;uch vanitys as they put a value upon; and have no other care, than to get Mony for their &s;upply by begging, &s;tealing, brib|ing, and other infamous practices. Their Offices are more or le&s;s e&s;teem'd according to the opportunitys they afford for the exerci&s;e of the&s;e Vertues; and no man &s;eeks them for any other end than for gain, nor takes any other way than that which conduces to it. The u&s;ual means of attaining them are, by ob&s;erving the Prince's Humor, flattering his Vices, &s;erving him in his Plea&s;ures, fomenting his Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ions, and by advancing his wor&s;t De&s;igns, to create an opinion in him that they love his per&s;on, and are intirely ad|dicted to his Will. When Valor, Indu&s;try and Wi&s;dom advanc'd men to Offices, it was no ea&s;y matter for a man to per&s;uade the Senat he had &s;uch Qualitys as were requir'd, if he had them not: But when Princes &s;eek only &s;uch as love them, and will do what they command, 'tis ea&s;y to impo&s;e upon them; and becau&s;e none that are good will obey them when they command that which is not &s;o, they are always encom|pa&s;t by the wor&s;t. Tho&s;e who follow them only for Reward, are mo&s;t liberal in profe&s;&s;ing affection to them, and by that means ri&s;e to places of Authority and Power. The Fountain being thus corrupted, nothing that is pure can come from it. The&s;e mercenary Wretches having the ma|nagement of Affairs, Ju&s;tice and Honors are &s;et at a price, and the mo&s;t lucrative Traffick in the world is thereby e&s;tabli&s;h'd. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>&mdash;Nunc uberiore rapina</L>

tho&s;e who could bribe them, were &s;ure to be advanc'd to the highe&s;t   Offices; and whatever they did, fear'd no puni&s;hment. Like Effects will ever proceed from the like Cau&s;es. When Vanity, Luxury and Prodiga|lity are in fa&s;hion, the de&s;ire of Riches mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily increa&s;e in pro|portion to them: And when the Power is in the hands of ba&s;e mercenary per&s;ons, they will always (to u&s;e the Courtiers phra&s;e) make as much profit of their places as they can. Not only matters of Favor, but of Ju&s;tice too, will be expos'd to &s;ale; and no way will be open to Honors or Magi&s;tracys, but by paying largely for them. He that gets an Office by the&s;e means, will not execute it <HI>gratis:</HI> he thinks he may &s;ell what he has bought; and would not have enter'd by corrupt ways, if he had not in|tended to deal corruptly. Nay, if a well-meaning man &s;hould &s;uffer him&s;elf to be &s;o far carry'd away by the &s;tream of a prevailing Cu&s;tom, as to purcha&s;e Honors of &s;uch Villains, he would be oblig'd to continue in the &s;ame cour&s;e, that he might gain Riches to procure the continuance of his Benefactors protection, or to obtain the favor of &s;uch as happen to &s;ucceed them: And the corruption thus beginning in the Head, mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily diffu&s;e it &s;elf into all the Members of the Commonwealth. Or, if any one (which is not to be expected) after having bin guilty of one Villany, &s;hould re&s;olve to commit no more, it could have no other effect than to bring him to ruin; and he being taken away, all things would re|turn to their former channel.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, who&s;oever de&s;ires to advance him&s;elf, mu&s;t u&s;e &s;uch means as are &s;utable to the time in which he lives, and the humor of the per&s;ons with whom he is to deal. It had bin as ab&s;urd for any man void of merit to &s;et him&s;elf up again&s;t <HI>Junius Brutus, Cincinnatus, Papirius Cur&s;or, Camillus, Fabius Maximus,</HI> or <HI>Scipio;</HI> and by bribing the Senat and People of <HI>Rome,</HI> think to be cho&s;en Captain again&s;t the <HI>Tarquins, Tu&s;cans, Latins, Samnites, Gauls</HI> or <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> as for the mo&s;t vertu|ous men by the mo&s;t certain proofs of their Wi&s;dom, Experience, Inte|grity and Valor, to expect advancement from <HI>Caligula, Claudius,</HI> and <HI>Nero,</HI> or the leud Wretches that govern'd them. They hated and fear'd all tho&s;e that excel'd in Vertue, and &s;etting them&s;elves to de&s;troy the be&s;t for being the be&s;t, they plac'd the &s;trength of the Government in the hands of the wor&s;t, which produc'd the effects beforemention'd. This &s;eems to have bin &s;o well known, that no man pretended to be great at Court, but tho&s;e who had ca&s;t off all thoughts of honor and common hone&s;ty: <HI>Revertar cum Leno, Meretrix, Scurra, Cinaedus ero,</HI> &s;aid one who &s;aw what manners prevail'd there; and where&s;oever they do prevail, &s;uch as will ri&s;e, mu&s;t render them&s;elves conformable in all corruption and venality. And it may be ob&s;erv'd, that a noble Per&s;on now living among&s;t us, who is a great enemy to Bribery, was turn'd out from a con|&s;iderable Office, as a &s;candal to the Court; for, &s;aid the principal Mini&s;ter, he will make no profit of his place, and by that means ca&s;ts a &s;candal up|on tho&s;e that do.</P>
<P>If any man &s;ay, this is not generally the fate of all Courts, I confe&s;s it; and that if the Prince be ju&s;t, vertuous, wi&s;e, of great Spirit, and not pretending to be ab&s;olute, he may chu&s;e &s;uch men as are not merce|nary, or take &s;uch a cour&s;e as may render it hard for them to de&s;erve Bribes, or to pre&s;erve them&s;elves from puni&s;hment, if they &s;hould deflect from his intention. And a Prince of this Age, &s;peaking familiarly with &s;ome great Men about him, &s;aid, he had heard much of va&s;t Gains made by tho&s;e who were near to Princes, and ask'd if they made the like? one

  of them an&s;wer'd, that they were as willing as others to get &s;omething, but that no man would give them a farthing; for every one finding a free admittance to his Maje&s;ty, no man needed a Sollicitor: And it was no le&s;s known that he did of him&s;elf grant tho&s;e things that were ju&s;t, than that none of them had &s;o much credit as to promote &s;uch as were not &s;o. I will not &s;ay &s;uch a King is a Phenix; perhaps more than one may be found in an Age; but they are certainly rare, and all that is good in their Government proceeding from the excellency of their per&s;onal Vertues, it mu&s;t fail when that Vertue fails which was the root of it. Experience &s;hews how little we can rely upon &s;uch a help; for where Crowns are hereditary, Children &s;eldom prove like to their Fathers; and &s;uch as are elective have al&s;o their defects. Many &s;eem to be mode&s;t and innocent in private Fortunes, who prove corrupt and vicious when they are rais'd to Power. The violence, pride and malice of <HI>Saul,</HI> was never di&s;cover'd till the People had plac'd him in the Throne. But where the Govern|ment is Ab&s;olute, or the Prince endeavours to make it &s;o, this integrity can never be found: He will always &s;eek &s;uch as are content to de|pend upon his Will, which being always unruly, good men will never comply; ill men will be paid for it, and that opens a gap to all manner of corruption. Something like to this may befal regular Monarchys, or po|pular Governments. They who are plac'd in the principal Offices of tru&s;t, may be treacherous; and when they are &s;o, they will always by the&s;e means &s;eek to gain Partizans and Dependents upon them&s;elves. Their de&s;igns being corrupt, they mu&s;t be carry'd on by corruption: But &s;uch as would &s;upport Monarchy in its regularity, or popular Govern|ments, mu&s;t oppo&s;e it, or be de&s;troy'd by it. And nothing can better manife&s;t how far Ab&s;olute Monarchys are more &s;ubject to this venality and corruption than the regular and popular Governments, than that they are rooted in the principle of the one, which cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without them; and are &s;o contrary to the others, that they mu&s;t certainly peri&s;h unle&s;s they defend them&s;elves from them.</P>
<P>If any man be &s;o far of another opinion, as to believe that <HI>Brutus, Camillus, Scipio, Fabius, Hannibal, Pericles, Ari&s;tides, Age&s;ilaus, Epami|nondas</HI> or <HI>Pelopidas,</HI> were as ea&s;ily corrupted as <HI>Sejanus, Tigellinus, Vinni|us</HI> or <HI>Laco:</HI> That the Senat and People of <HI>Rome, Carthage, Athens, Sparta</HI> or <HI>Thebes,</HI> were to be bought at as ea&s;y rates as one profligate Villain, a Slave, an Eunuch or a Whore; or tho it was not in former Ages, yet it is &s;o now: he may be pleas'd to con&s;ider by what means men now ri&s;e to places of Judicature, Church-preferment, or any Offices of tru&s;t, honor or profit under tho&s;e Monarchys which we know, that either are or would be ab&s;olute. Let him examin how all the Offices of Ju&s;tice are now di&s;pos'd in <HI>France;</HI> how <HI>Mazarin</HI> came to be advanc'd; what traf|fick he made of Abbys and Bi&s;hopricks, and what trea&s;ures he gain'd by that means: Whether the like has not continu'd &s;ince his death, and as a laudable Example bin tran&s;mitted to us &s;ince his Maje&s;ty's happy re&s;taura|tion: Whether Bauds, Whores, Thieves, Buffoons, Para&s;ites, and &s;uch vile wretches as are naturally mercenary, have not more Power at <HI>Whitehall, Ver&s;ailles,</HI> the Vatican, and the E&s;curial, than in <HI>Venice, Am&s;terdam,</HI> and <HI>Switzerland:</HI> Whether <HI>H-de, Arl-ngt-n, D-nby,</HI> their Graces of <HI>Cleveland</HI> and <HI>Port&s;mouth, S-nd-rl-nd, Jenkins</HI> or <HI>Chiffinch,</HI> could probably have attain'd &s;uch Power as they have had among&s;t us, if it had bin di&s;pos'd by the Suffrages of the Parliament and People: Or la&s;tly, Whether &s;uch as know only how to work upon the per&s;onal Vices of a man, have more

<P>But if he who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es or affects an ab&s;olute Power be by his intere&s;t led to introduce that corruption which the People, Senat, and Magi&s;trats who uphold Popular Governments, abhor, as that which threatens them with de&s;truction: if the example, arts, and means us'd by him and his dependents be of wonderful efficacy towards the introduction of it: if nothing but an admirable Vertue, which can hardly be in one that enjoys or de&s;ires &s;uch a Power, can divert him from that de&s;ign; and if &s;uch Vertue never did, nor probably ever will continue long in any one Fami|ly, we cannot rationally believe there ever was a race of men inve&s;ted with, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;uch a Power, or that there will ever be any, who have not and will not endeavour to introduce that corruption, which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the defence of their Per&s;ons, and mo&s;t important Concern|ments, and certainly accompli&s;h their great De&s;ign, unle&s;s they are op|pos'd or remov'd.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXVI. Civil Tumults and Wars are not the greate&s;t Evils that befal Nations.</HEAD>
<P><HI>B&V;T skin for skin,</HI> &s;ays our Author, <HI>and all that a man has will he give for his life.</HI> And &s;ince it was nece&s;&s;ary to grace his Book with &s;ome Scripture-phra&s;es, none could be fitter for that purpo&s;e than tho&s;e that were &s;poken by the Devil; but they will be of little u&s;e to him: For tho I &s;hould &s;o far recede from truth, as to avow tho&s;e words to be true, I might &s;afely deny the Conclu&s;ions he draws from them, <HI>That tho&s;e are the wor&s;t Governments under which mo&s;t men are &s;lain; or, that more are &s;lain in Popular Governments than in Ab&s;olute Monarchys.</HI> For having prov'd that all the Wars and Tumults that have happen'd in Commonwealths, have never produc'd &s;uch &s;laughters as were brought upon the Empires of <HI>Macedon</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> or the Kingdoms of <HI>I&s;rael, Judah, France, Spain, Scotland</HI> or <HI>England,</HI> by Conte&s;ts between &s;everal Competitors for tho&s;e Crowns; if Tumult, War, and Slaughter, be the point in que&s;tion, tho&s;e are the wor&s;t of all Governments where they have bin mo&s;t fre|quent and cruel. But tho the&s;e are terrible Scourges, I deny that Govern|ment to be &s;imply the wor&s;t that has mo&s;t of them. 'Tis ill that men &s;hould kill one another in Seditions, Tumults and Wars; but 'tis wor&s;e to bring Nations to &s;uch mi&s;ery, weakne&s;s and ba&s;ene&s;s, as to have nei|ther &s;trength nor courage to contend for any thing; to have nothing left worth defending, and to give the name of Peace to de&s;olation. I take <HI>Greece</HI> to have bin happy and glorious, when it was full of populous Ci|tys, flouri&s;hing in all the Arts that de&s;erve prai&s;e among men: When they were courted and fear'd by the greate&s;t Kings, and never a&s;&s;aulted by any but to his own lo&s;s and confu&s;ion: When <HI>Babylon</HI> and <HI>Su&s;a</HI> trem|bled at the motion of their Arms; and their valor exercis'd in the&s;e Wars and Tumults, which our Author looks upon as the greate&s;t Evils, was rais'd to &s;uch a power that nothing upon Earth was found able to re&s;i&s;t them: and I think it now mi&s;erable, when Peace reigns within their
<PB N="186" REF="192">
  empty walls, and the poor remains of tho&s;e exhau&s;ted Nations &s;hel|tering them&s;elves under the ruins of the de&s;olated Citys, have neither any thing that de&s;erves to be di&s;puted among&s;t them, nor &s;pirit or force to repel the Injurys they daily &s;uffer from a proud and in&s;upportable Ma|&s;ter.</P>
<P>The like may be &s;aid of <HI>Italy:</HI> Whil&s;t it was inhabited by Nations go|verning them&s;elves by their own Will, they fell &s;ometimes into dome&s;tick Seditions, and had frequent Wars with their Neighbors. When they were free, they lov'd their Country, and were always ready to fight in its defence. Such as &s;ucceeded well, increas'd in vigor and power; and even tho&s;e that were the mo&s;t unfortunate in one Age, found means to repair their greate&s;t lo&s;&s;es if their Government continu'd. Whil&s;t they had a propriety in their goods, they would not &s;uffer the Country to be invaded, &s;ince they knew they could have none if it were lo&s;t. This gave occa&s;ion to Wars and Tumults; but it &s;harpen'd their Courage, kept up a good Di&s;ciplin, and the Nations that were mo&s;t exercis'd by them, always increas'd in power and number; &s;o that no Country &s;eems ever to have bin of greater &s;trength than <HI>Italy</HI> was when <HI>Hannibal</HI> inva|ded it: and after his defeat, the re&s;t of the World was not able to refi&s;t their Valor and Power. They &s;ometimes kill'd one another; but their Enemys never got any thing but burying-places within their Territorys. All things are now brought into a very different method by the ble&s;&s;ed Governments they are under. The fatherly care of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> the Pope, and other Princes, has e&s;tabli&s;h'd Peace among&s;t them. We have not in many Ages heard of any Sedition among the <HI>Latins, Sabins, Vol&s;ci, Equi, Samnites,</HI> or others. The thin, half-&s;tarv'd Inhabitants of Walls &s;upported by Ivy, &s;ear neither popular Tumults, or foreign Alarms; and their &s;leep is only interrupted by Hunger, the crys of their Children, or the howling of Wolves. In&s;tead of many turbulent, con|tentious Citys, they have a few &s;catter'd &s;ilent Cottages; and the fierce|ne&s;s of tho&s;e Nations is &s;o temper'd, that every ra&s;cally Collector of Taxes extorts without fear from every man, that which &s;hould be the nouri&s;hment of his Family. And if any of tho&s;e Countrys are free from that pernicious Vermin, 'tis thro the extremity of their Poverty. Even in <HI>Rome</HI> a man may be circumvented by the fraud of a Prie&s;t, or poi&s;on'd by one who would have his E&s;tate, Wife, Whore, or Child; but no|thing is done that looks like Tumult or Violence. The Governors do as little fear <HI>Gracchus</HI> as <HI>Hannibal;</HI> and in&s;tead of wearying their Sub|jects in Wars, they only &s;eek, by perverted Laws, corrupt Judges, fal&s;e Witne&s;&s;es, and vexatious Suits, to cheat them of their Mony and Inheri|tance. This is the be&s;t part of their condition. Where the&s;e Arts are us'd, there are men, and they have &s;omething to lo&s;e; but for the mo&s;t part the Lands ly wa&s;t, and they who were &s;ormerly troubled with the di&s;orders incident to populous Citys, now enjoy the quiet and peaceable e&s;tate of a Wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P>Again; there is a way of killing wor&s;e than that of the Sword: for as <HI>Tertullian</HI> &s;ays upon a different occa&s;ion, <HI>prohibere na&s;ci e&s;t occidere;</HI> tho&s;e Governments are in the highe&s;t degree guilty of Blood, which by taking from men the means of living, bring &s;ome to peri&s;h thro want, drive others out of the Country, and generally di&s;&s;uade men from marriage, by taking from them all ways of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting their Familys. Notwith&s;tan|ding all the Seditions of <HI>Florence,</HI> and other Citys of <HI>Tu&s;cany,</HI> the horrid Factions of <HI>Guelphs</HI> and <HI>Gibelins, Neri</HI> and <HI>Bianchi,</HI> Nobles and Commons,
<PB N="187" REF="193">
they continu'd populous, &s;trong, and exceeding rich; but in the &s;pace of   le&s;s than a hundred and fifty years, the peaceable Reign of the <HI>Medices</HI> is thought to have de&s;troy'd nine parts in ten of the people of that Pro|vince. Among&s;t other things 'tis remarkable, that when <HI>Philip</HI> the &s;e|cond of <HI>Spain</HI> gave <HI>Sienna</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Florence,</HI> his Emba&s;&s;ador then at <HI>Rome</HI> &s;ent him word, that he had given away more than &s;ix hundred and fifty thou&s;and Subjects; and 'tis not believ'd there are now twenty thou|&s;and Souls inhabiting that City and Territory. <HI>Pi&s;a, Pi&s;toia, Arezzo, Cor|tona,</HI> and other Towns that were then good and populous, are in the like proportion dimini&s;h'd, and <HI>Florence</HI> more than any. When that City had bin long troubled with Seditions, Tumults, and Wars, for the mo&s;t part unpro&s;perous, they &s;till retain'd &s;uch &s;trength, that when <HI>Charles</HI> the eighth of <HI>France</HI> being admitted as a Friend with his whole Army, which <NOTE PLACE="marg">Guicciard.</NOTE>&s;oon after conquer'd the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> thought to ma&s;ter them, the people taking up Arms &s;truck &s;uch a terror into him, that he was glad to depart upon &s;uch conditions as they thought fit to impo&s;e. <HI>Machiavel</HI> reports, that in that time <HI>Florence</HI> alone, with the <HI>Vald' Arno,</HI> a &s;mall Ter|ritory belonging to that City, could, in a few hours, by the &s;ound of a Bell, bring together a hundred and thirty five thou&s;and well arm'd men; where|as now that City, with all the others in that Province, are brought to &s;uch de&s;picable weakne&s;s, emptine&s;s, poverty and ba&s;ene&s;s, that they can nei|ther re&s;i&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ions of their own Prince, nor defend him or them|&s;elves if they were a&s;&s;aulted by a foreign Enemy. The People are di&s;|pers'd or de&s;troy'd, and the be&s;t Familys &s;ent to &s;eek Habitations in <HI>Ve|nice, Genoa, Rome,</HI> and <HI>Lucca.</HI> This is not the effect of War or Pe&s;tilence; they enjoy a perfect peace, and &s;uffer no other plague than the Govern|ment they are under. But he who has thus cur'd 'em of Di&s;orders and Tumults, dos, in my opinion, de&s;erve no greater prai&s;e than a Phy&s;ician, who &s;hould boa&s;t there was not a &s;ick per&s;on in a hou&s;e committed to his care, when he had poi&s;on'd all that were in it. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> have e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd the like peace in the Kingdoms of <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Sicily,</HI> the <HI>We&s;t-Indys,</HI> and other places. The <HI>Turks</HI> by the &s;ame means prevent Tu|mults in their Dominions. And they are of &s;uch efficacy in all places, that <HI>Mario Chigi,</HI> Brother to Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> the &s;eventh, by one &s;ordid cheat upon the &s;ale of Corn, is &s;aid within eight years to have de&s;troy'd above a third part of the people in the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical State; and that Coun|try, which was the &s;trength of the <HI>Romans</HI> in the time of the <HI>Carthagini|an</HI> Wars, &s;uffer'd more by the covetou&s;ne&s;s and fraud of that Villain, than by all the defeats receiv'd from <HI>Hannibal.</HI></P>
<P>'Twere an endle&s;s work to mention all the places where this peace|able &s;olitude has bin introduc'd by ab&s;olute Monarchy; but Popular and regular Governments have always apply'd them&s;elves to increa&s;e the Number, Strength, Power, Riches, and Courage of their People, by providing comfortable ways of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for their own Citizens, invit|ing Strangers, and filling them all with &s;uch a love to their Country, that every man might look upon the publick Cau&s;e as his own, and be always ready to defend it. This may &s;ometimes give occa&s;ion to Tu|mults and Wars, as the mo&s;t vigorous Bodys may fall into Di&s;tempers: When every one is &s;olicitous for the Publick, there may be difference of opinion, and &s;ome by mi&s;taking the way may bring prejudice when they intend profit: But unle&s;s a Tyrant dos ari&s;e, and de&s;troy the Government which is the root of their felicity; or they be overwhelm'd by the irre&s;i|&s;tible power of a Vertue or Fortune greater than their own, they &s;oon re|cover,

  and for the mo&s;t part ri&s;e up in greater Glory and Pro&s;perity than be|fore. This was &s;een in the Commonwealths of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> which for this rea&s;on were ju&s;tly called Nur&s;erys of Vertue, and their Magi&s;trats Pre&s;ervers of men; whereas our Author's peace-making Monarchs can de&s;erve no better title than that of Enemys and De&s;troyers of Mankind.</P>
<P>I cannot think him in earne&s;t when he exaggerates <HI>Sylla</HI>'s Crueltys, as a proof that the mi&s;chiefs &s;uffer'd under free States are more univer&s;al than under Kings and Tyrants: For there never was a Tyrant in the World if he was not one; tho thro wearine&s;s, infirmity of body, fear, or perhaps the horror of his own wickedne&s;s, he at length re&s;ign'd his Power; but the evil had taken root &s;o deep, that it could not be remov'd: There was nothing of Liberty remaining in <HI>Rome:</HI> The Laws were overthrown by the violence of the Sword; the remaining Conte&s;t was who &s;hould be Lord: and there is no rea&s;on to believe that if <HI>Pompey</HI> had gain'd the Bat|tel of <HI>Phar&s;alia,</HI> he would have made a more mode&s;t u&s;e of his Victory than <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> did; or that <HI>Rome</HI> would have bin more happy under him than under the other. His Cau&s;e was more plau&s;ible becau&s;e the Senat fol|low'd him, and <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> was the Invader; but he was no better in his per|&s;on, and his de&s;igns &s;eem to have bin the &s;ame. He had bin long before <HI>&s;uarum legum auctor &amp; ever&s;or.</HI> He gave the beginning to the fir&s;t Tri|umvirat; and 'twere folly to think that he who had bin in&s;olent when he was not come to the highe&s;t pitch of Fortune, would have prov'd mode|rate if &s;ucce&s;s had put all into his hands. The proceedings of <HI>Marius, Cinna, Catiline, Octavius,</HI> and <HI>Antonius</HI> were all of the &s;ame nature. No Laws were ob&s;erv'd: no publick Good intended; the ambition of private per&s;ons reign'd; and what&s;oever was done by them, or for their intere&s;ts, can no more be apply'd to Popular, Ari&s;tocratical or mix'd Governments, than the furys of <HI>Caligula</HI> and <HI>Nero.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXVII. The Mi&s;chiefs and Crueltys proceeding from Tyranny, are greater than any that can come from Popular or mix'd Governments.</HEAD>
<P>'TIs now time to examin the rea&s;ons of our Author's general Maxims. <HI>The Crueltys,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>of a Tyrant extend ordinarily no farther than &s;ome particular men that offend him, and not to the whole Kingdom. It is truly &s;aid of his late Maje&s;ty King</HI> James, <HI>A King can never be &s;o notoriou&s;ly vicious, but he will generally favour Ju&s;tice, and maintain &s;ome order. Even cruel</HI> Domitian, Diony&s;ius <HI>the Tyrant, and many others are commended in Hi&s;torys as great ob&s;ervers of Ju&s;tice, except in particular ca&s;es, wherein his inordinate lu&s;ts may carry him away.</HI> It may be &s;aid of Popular Govern|ments, that tho a People thro error do &s;ometimes hurt a private per&s;on, and that injury may po&s;&s;ibly re&s;ult to the publick damage, becau&s;e the man that is offended or de&s;troy'd, might have bin u&s;eful to the Society, yet they never do it otherwi&s;e than by error: For having the Government in them&s;elves, whatever is prejudicial to it, is &s;o to them; and if they ruin it, they ruin them&s;elves, which no man ever did willingly and knowingly. But in ab&s;olute Monarchys the matter is quite otherwi&s;e. A Prince that &s;ets up an intere&s;t in him&s;elf, becomes an Enemy to the Publick: in fol|lowing his own lu&s;ts he offends all, except a few of his corrupt Creatures,
<PB N="189" REF="195">
by who&s;e help he oppre&s;&s;es others with a Yoke they are unwilling to bear,   and thereby incurs the univer&s;al hatred. This hatred is always proporti|onable to the injurys receiv'd, which being extreme, that mu&s;t be &s;o too; and every People being powerful in compari&s;on to the Prince that governs, he will always fear tho&s;e that hate him, and always hate tho&s;e he fears. When <HI>Luigi Farne&s;e</HI> fir&s;t Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> had by his Tyranny incens'd the People of that &s;mall City, their hatred was not le&s;s mortal to him than that of the whole Empire had bin to <HI>Nero;</HI> and as the one burnt <HI>Rome,</HI> the other would have de&s;troy'd <HI>Parma,</HI> if he had not bin prevent|ed. The like has bin, and will be every where, in as much as every man endeavours to de&s;troy tho&s;e whom he hates and fears; and the great|ne&s;s of the danger often drives this <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cuncta &s;erit dum cuncta timet. <BIBL>Lucan.</BIBL></NOTE>fear to rage and madne&s;s. For this rea&s;on <HI>Caligula</HI> wi&s;h'd but one Neck to all the People; and <HI>Nero</HI> tri|umph'd over the burning City, thinking by that ruin he had prevented his own danger. I know not who the good Authors are that commend <HI>Domitian</HI> for his Ju&s;tice: but <HI>Tacitus</HI> calls him <HI>Principem virtutibus infe|&s;tum;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tacit. in Vit. Agric.</NOTE>and 'tis hard to find out how &s;uch a man can be an ob&s;erver of ju&s;tice; unle&s;s it be ju&s;t, that whoever dares to be vertuous under a vici|ous and ba&s;e Prince &s;hould be de&s;troy'd. Another <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Cum jam &s;emianimem laceraret Flavius orbem</L>
<L>Tertius, &amp; calvo &s;erviret Roma Tyranno. <BIBL>Juvenal.</BIBL></L></Q></NOTE> Author of the &s;ame time &s;peaking of him, dos not &s;ay he was unju&s;t, but gives us rea&s;on to think he was &s;o (unle&s;s it were ju&s;t for him, who had a power over the be&s;t part of the World, to de&s;troy it) and that he who by his cruelty had brought it to the la&s;t ga&s;p, would have fini&s;h'd the work, if his rage had not bin extingui&s;h'd.</P>
<P>Many Princes not having in them&s;elves power to de&s;troy their People, have &s;tir'd up foreign Nations again&s;t them, and plac'd the only hopes of their &s;afety in the publick Calamity; and lawful Kings when they have fall n <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nto the fir&s;t degree of madne&s;s, &s;o as to a&s;&s;ume a power above that which was allow'd by the Law, have in fury prov'd equal to the wor&s;t U&s;urpers. <HI>Cleonymus</HI> of <HI>Sparta</HI> was of this &s;ort: He became, &s;ays <HI>Plu|tarch,</HI> an Enemy to the City, becau&s;e they would not allow him the ab&s;o|l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">e <NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. Vit.

We&s;tm.</NOTE>People, who were incens'd again&s;t him for his Leudne&s;s, Cruelty, and Ba&s;ene&s;s. King <HI>John</HI> for the like rea&s;ons offer'd the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> to the <HI>Moors,</HI> and to the Pope. <HI>Peter</HI> the Cruel, and other Kings of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> brought va&s;t Armys of <HI>Moors</HI> into <HI>Spain</HI> to the ruin of their own People, who dete&s;ted their Vices, and would not part with their Privileges. Many other examples of the like nature might be alledg'd; and I wi&s;h our own experience did not too well prove that &s;uch de&s;igns are common. Let him that doubts this examin the Cau&s;es of the Wars with <HI>Scotland</HI> in the Years 1639, 1640; the &s;laughters of the Prote&s;tants in <HI>Ireland</HI> 1641; the whole cour&s;e of Alliances and Treatys for the &s;pace of four&s;core Years; the friend&s;hip contracted with the <HI>French;</HI> frequent Quarrels with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> together with other circum&s;tances that are already made too pub|lick. If he be not convinc'd by this, he may &s;oon &s;ee a man in the Throne, who had rather be a Tributary to <HI>France</HI> than a lawful King of <HI>England,</HI> whil&s;t either Parliament or People &s;hall dare to di&s;pute his
<PB N="190" REF="196">
  Commands, in&s;i&s;t upon their own Rights, or defend a Religion incon&s;i|&s;tent with that which he has e&s;pous'd; and then the truth will be &s;o evi|dent as to require no proof.</P>
<P><HI>Grotius</HI> was never accus'd of dealing hardly with Kings, or laying too much weight upon imaginary ca&s;es; neverthele&s;s among&s;t other rea&s;ons that in his opinion ju&s;tify Subjects in taking arms again&s;t their Princes, he <NOTE PLACE="marg">De Jur. Bel.</NOTE>alledges this, <HI>propter immanem &s;aevitiam,</HI> and <HI>quando Rex in Populi exitium fertur;</HI> in as much as it is <HI>contrary to, and incon&s;i&s;tent with the ends for which Governments are in&s;tituted:</HI> which were mo&s;t impertinent, if no &s;uch thing could be; for that which is not, can have no effect. There are therefore Princes who &s;eek the de&s;truction of their People, or none could be ju&s;tly oppos'd on that account.</P>
<P>If King <HI>James</HI> was of another opinion, I could wi&s;h the cour&s;e of his Government had bin &s;uted to it. When he &s;aid that whil&s;t he had the power of making Judges and Bi&s;hops, he would make that to be Law and Go&s;pel which be&s;t pleas'd him, and accordingly fill'd tho&s;e places with &s;uch as turn'd both according to his Will and Intere&s;ts; I mu&s;t think that by overthrowing Ju&s;tice, which is the rule of civil and moral Acti|ons, and perverting the Go&s;pel which is the light of the &s;piritual man, he left nothing unattempted that he dur&s;t attempt, by which he might bring the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and univer&s;al evils upon our Nation that any can &s;uffer. This would &s;tand good, tho Princes never err'd, unle&s;s they were <HI>tran&s;ported with &s;ome inordinate Lu&s;ts;</HI> for 'tis hard to find one that dos not live in the perpetual power of them. They are naturally &s;ubject to the impul&s;e of &s;uch appetites as well as others; and whatever evil reigns in their Nature is fomented by Education. 'Tis the handle by which their Flatterers lead them; and he that di&s;covers to what Vice a Prince is mo&s;t inclin'd, is &s;ure to govern him by rendring him&s;elf &s;ub&s;ervient. In this con&s;i&s;ts the chief art of a Courtier, and by this means it comes to pa&s;s that &s;uch Lu&s;ts as in private men are curb'd by fear, do not only rage as in a wild Bea&s;t, but are perpetually inflam'd by the malice of their own Servants: their hatred to the Laws of God or Men that might re|&s;train them, increa&s;es in proportion with their Vices, or their fears of be|ing puni&s;h'd for them. When they are come to this, they can &s;et no li|mits to their &s;ury, and there is no extravagance into which they do not fre|quently fall. But many of 'em do not expect the&s;e violent motives: the perver&s;ity of their own nature carrys them to the extremitys of evil. They hate Vertue for its own &s;ake, and vertuous men for being mo&s;t un|like to them&s;elves. Vertue is the dictate of Rea&s;on, or the remains of Divine Light, by which men are made beneficent and beneficial to each other. Religion proceeds from the &s;ame &s;pring, and tends to the &s;ame end; and the good of Mankind &s;o intirely depends upon the&s;e two, that no People ever enjoy'd any thing worth de&s;iring that was not the product of them; and what&s;oever any have &s;uffer'd that de&s;erves to be abhor'd and fear'd, has proceeded either from the defect of the&s;e, or the wrath of God again&s;t them. If any Prince therefore has bin an enemy to Vertue and Religion, he mu&s;t al&s;o have bin an enemy to Mankind, and mo&s;t e&s;pecially to the People under him. What&s;oever he dos again&s;t tho&s;e that excel in Vertue and Religion, tends to the de&s;truction of the People who &s;ub&s;i&s;t by them. I will not take upon me to define who they are, or to tell the number of tho&s;e that do this: but 'tis certain there have bin &s;uch; and I wi&s;h I could &s;ay they were few in number, or that they had liv'd only in pa&s;t ages. <HI>Tacitus</HI> dos not fix this upon one Prince, but
<PB N="191" REF="197">
upon all that he writes of; and to give his Readers a ta&s;t of what he was   to write, he &s;ays, <HI>that Nobility and Honors were dangerous, but that Vertue</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tacit, H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t. l. 1.</NOTE><HI>brought mo&s;t certain de&s;truction;</HI> and in another place, that <HI>after the &s;laugh|ter of many excellent men,</HI> Nero <HI>re&s;olv'd to cut down Vertue it &s;elf, and</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Annal. l. 4.</NOTE><HI>therefore kill'd</HI> Thra&s;eas Paetus <HI>and</HI> Bareas Soranus. And who&s;oever exa|mins the Chri&s;tian or Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;torys, will find tho&s;e Princes to have bin no le&s;s enemys to Vertue and Religion than their Predece&s;&s;ors, and con&s;equently enemys to the Nations under them, unle&s;s Religion and Vertue be things prejudicial or indifferent to Mankind.</P>
<P>But our Author may &s;ay, the&s;e were particular ca&s;es; and &s;o was the &s;laughter of the Prophets and Apo&s;tles, the crucifixion of Chri&s;t, and all the Villanys that have ever bin committed; yet they proceeded from a univer&s;al principle of hatred to all that is good, exerting it &s;elf as far as it could, to the ruin of mankind: And nothing but the overruling Power of God, who re&s;olv'd to pre&s;erve to him&s;elf a People, could &s;et bounds to their Rage, which in other re&s;pects had as full &s;ucce&s;s as our Author or the Devil could have wi&s;h'd.</P>
<P><HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> (his other example of Ju&s;tice) de&s;erves ob&s;ervation: More fal&s;hood, leudne&s;s, treachery, ingratitude, cruelty, ba&s;ene&s;s, avarice, impudence and hatred to all manner of Good, was hardly ever known in in a mortal Creature. For this rea&s;on <HI>Diogenes</HI> &s;eeing him at <HI>Corinth,</HI> tho in a poor and contemptible condition, &s;aid, he rather de&s;erv'd to have continu'd in the mi&s;ery, fears and villanys of his Tyranny, than to be &s;uf|fer'd peaceably to conver&s;e with hone&s;t men. And if &s;uch as the&s;e are to be call'd ob&s;ervers of Ju&s;tice, it mu&s;t be concluded that the Laws of God and of Men, are either of no value, or contrary to it; and that the de&s;truction of Nations is a better work than their pre&s;ervation. No Faith is to be ob&s;erv'd: Temples may be ju&s;tly &s;ack'd; the be&s;t men &s;lain for daring to be better than their Ma&s;ters; and the whole World, if it were in the power of one Man, rightly torn in pieces and de&s;troy'd.</P>
<P>His Rea&s;ons for this are as good as his Doctrin: <HI>It is,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>the mul|titude of people and abundance of riches, that are the glory and &s;trength of eve|ry Prince: the bodys of his Subjects do him &s;ervice in War, and their goods &s;upply his wants. Therefore if not out of affection to his people, yet out of na|tural love unto him&s;elf, every Tyrant de&s;ires to pre&s;erve the lives and goods of his Subjects.</HI> I &s;hould have thought that Princes, tho Tyrants, being God's Vicegerents, and Fathers of their People, would have &s;ought their good, tho no advantage had thereby redounded to them&s;elves, but it &s;eems no &s;uch thing is to be expected from them. They con&s;ider Nati|ons, as Gra&s;iers do their Herds and Flocks, according to the profit that can be made of them: and if this be &s;o, a People has no more &s;ecurity under a Prince, than a Herd or Flock under their Ma&s;ter. Tho he de|&s;ire to be a good Husband, yet they mu&s;t be deliver'd up to the &s;laughter when he finds a good Market, or a better way of improving his Land; but they are often fooli&s;h, riotous, prodigal, and wantonly de&s;troy their Stock, tho to their own prejudice. We thought that all Princes and Ma|gi&s;trats had bin &s;et up, that under them we might live quietly and peace|ably, in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty: but our Author teaches us, that they only &s;eek what they can make of our Bodys and Goods, and that they do not live and reign for us, but for them&s;elves. If this be true, they look upon us not as Children, but as Bea&s;ts; nor do us any good for our own &s;akes, or becau&s;e it is their duty, but only that we may be u&s;eful to them, as Oxen are put into plentiful Pa&s;tures that they may be &s;trong for labour,
<PB N="192" REF="198">
  or fit for &s;laughter. This is the divine Model of Government that he of|fers to the World. The ju&s;t Magi&s;trate is the Mini&s;ter of God for our good: but this Ab&s;olute Monarch has no other care of us, than as our Riches and Multitude may increa&s;e his own Glory and Strength. We might ea&s;ily judg what would be the i&s;&s;ue of &s;uch a Principle, when the Being of Nations depending upon his will, mu&s;t al&s;o depend upon his opi|nion whether the Strength, Multitude and Riches of a People do con|duce to the increa&s;e of Glory and Power or not, tho Hi&s;torys were &s;ilent in the ca&s;e; for the&s;e things &s;peak of them&s;elves. The judgment of a &s;ingle man is not to be rely'd upon; the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t do o&s;ten err, the fooli&s;h and perver&s;e always; and our di&s;cour&s;e is not of what <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> or <HI>Samuel</HI> would do, but what may come into the fancy of a furious or wicked man who may u&s;urp the &s;upreme Power, or a child, a woman, or a fool, that may inherit it. Be&s;ides, the Propo&s;ition upon which he builds his Conclu&s;ion, proves often fal&s;e: for as the Riches, Power, Num|ber and Courage of our Friends is for our advantage, and that of our Enemys threatens us with ruin; tho&s;e Princes only can rea&s;onably believe the &s;trength of their Subjects beneficial to them, who govern &s;o as to be a&s;&s;ur'd of their Affection, and that their Strength will be imploy'd for them: But tho&s;e who know they are, or ju&s;tly de&s;erve to be hated, can|not but think it will be employ'd again&s;t them, and always &s;eek to dimi|ni&s;h that which creates their danger. This mu&s;t  certainly befal as many as are leud, fooli&s;h, negligent, imprudent, cowardly, wicked, vicious, or any way unworthy the places they obtain; for their Reign is a perpetu|al exerci&s;e of the mo&s;t extreme and ruinous Inju&s;tice: Every man that follows an hone&s;t Intere&s;t, is prejudic'd: Every one who finds the Power that was ordain'd for his good, to be turn'd to his hurt, will be angry and hate him that dos it: If the People be of uncorrupted manners, this hatred will be univer&s;al, becau&s;e every one of them de&s;ires that which is ju&s;t; if compos'd of good and evil, the fir&s;t will always be aver&s;e to the evil Government, and the others endeavouring to uphold it, the &s;afe|ty of the Prince mu&s;t depend upon the prevalence of either Party. If the be&s;t prove to be the &s;tronge&s;t, he mu&s;t peri&s;h: and knowing him&s;elf to be &s;upported only by the wor&s;t, he will always de&s;troy as many of his Enemys as he can; weaken tho&s;e that remain; enrich his Creatures with their Spoils and Confi&s;cations; by fraud and rapine accumulate Trea&s;ures to increa&s;e the number of his Party, and advance them into all places of power and tru&s;t, that by their a&s;&s;i&s;tance he may cru&s;h his Adver&s;arys; and every man is accounted his Adver&s;ary, who has either E&s;tate, Honor, Vertue or Reputation. This naturally ca&s;ts all the Power into the hands of tho&s;e who have no &s;uch dangerous qualitys, nor any thing to recom|mend them, but an ab&s;olute re&s;ignation of them&s;elves to do whatever they are commanded. The&s;e men having neither will nor knowledg to do good, as &s;oon as they come to be in power, Ju&s;tice is perverted, military Di&s;ci|plin neglected, the publick Trea&s;ures exhau&s;ted, new Projects invented to rai&s;e more; and the Prince's wants daily increa&s;ing, thro their igno|rance, negligence, or deceit, there is no end of their devices and tricks to gain &s;upplys. To this end &s;warms of Spys, Informers, and fal&s;e Witne&s;|&s;es are &s;ent out to circumvent the riche&s;t and mo&s;t eminent men: The Tri|bunals are fill'd with Court-Para&s;ites of profligate Con&s;ciences, Fortunes and Reputation, that no man may e&s;cape who is brought before them. If Crimes are wanting, the diligence of well&punc;cho&s;en Officers and Pro&s;e|cutors, with the favor of the Judges, &s;upply all defects; the Law is made a
<PB N="193" REF="199">
Snare; Vertue &s;uppre&s;s'd, Vice fomented, and in a &s;hort time Hone&s;ty   and Knavery, Sobriety and Leudne&s;s, Vertue and Vice, become Badges of the &s;everal Factions; and every man's conver&s;ation and manners &s;hew|ing to what Party he is addicted, the Prince who makes him&s;elf head of the wor&s;t, mu&s;t favour them to the overthrow of the be&s;t, which is &s;o &s;treight a way to an univer&s;al ruin, that no State can prevent it, unle&s;s that cour&s;e be interrupted.</P>
<P>The&s;e things con&s;ider'd, no general Judgment can be made of a Magi|&s;trate's Coun&s;els, from his Name or Duty. He that is ju&s;t, and become grateful to the People by doing good, will find his own Honor and Secu|rity in increa&s;ing their Number, Riches, Vertue, and Power: If on the other &s;ide, by doing evil, he has drawn upon him&s;elf the publick hatred, he will always endeavour to take from them the power of doing him any hurt, by bringing them into the utmo&s;t weakne&s;s, poverty, and ba&s;ene&s;s. And whoever would know whether any particular Prince de&s;ires to in|crea&s;e or de&s;troy the bodys and goods of his Subjects, mu&s;t examin whe|ther his Government be &s;uch as renders him grateful or odious to them; and whether he dos pur&s;ue the publick Intere&s;t, or for the advancement of his own Authority &s;et up one in him&s;elf contrary to that of his People; which can never befal a Popular Government, and con&s;equently no mi&s;chief equal to it can be produc'd by any &s;uch, unle&s;s &s;omething can be imagin'd wor&s;e than corruption and de&s;truction.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXVIII. Men living under Popular or Mix'd Governments, are more careful of the publick Good, than in Ab&s;olute Monarchys.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author delighting in &s;trange things, dos in the next place, with an admirable &s;agacity, di&s;cover two faults in Popular Governments, that were never found by any man before him; and the&s;e are no le&s;s than Ignorance and Negligence. Speaking of the Care of Princes to pre&s;erve their Subjects, he adds; <HI>On the contrary in a Popular State, every man knows the publick Good doth not wholly depend upon his Care, but the Common|wealth may be well enough govern'd by others, tho he only tend his private bu&s;i|ne&s;s.</HI> And a little below, <HI>Nor are they much to be blam'd for their Negli|gence, &s;ince it is an even wager their Ignorance may be as great. The Magi|&s;trats amongst the people being for the mo&s;t part annual, do always lay down their Office before they under&s;tand it; &s;o as a Prince of a duller under&s;tanding mu&s;t needs excel them.</HI> This is bravely determin'd, and the world is be|holden to <HI>Filmer</HI> for the di&s;covery of the Errors that have hitherto bin Epidemical. Mo&s;t men had believ'd, that &s;uch as live in Free States, are u&s;ually pleas'd with their condition, de&s;ire to maintain it; and every man finding his own good comprehended in the Publick, as tho&s;e that &s;ail in the &s;ame Ship, employs the Talent he has in endeavouring to pre&s;erve it, knowing that he mu&s;t peri&s;h if that mi&s;carry. This was an incou|ragement to Indu&s;try; and the continual Labors and Dangers to which the <HI>Romans</HI> and other free Nations expos'd them&s;elves, have bin taken for Te&s;timonys that they thought them&s;elves concern'd in the bu&s;ine&s;&s;es that pa&s;t among them, and that every one did not neglect them thro an opinion that they would be done well enough by others. It was al&s;o thought
<PB N="194" REF="200">
  that free Citys, by frequent Elections of Magi&s;trats, became Nur&s;erys of great and able Men, every man endeavouring to excel others, that he might be advanc'd to the Honor he had no other title to than what might ari&s;e from his Merit or Reputation; in which they &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that one of them may be ju&s;tly &s;aid to have produc'd more eminent Men, than all the Ab&s;olute Monarchys that have bin in the World. But the&s;e were mi&s;takes. Perhaps <HI>Brutus, Valerius,</HI> and other <HI>Roman</HI> Senators or Magi&s;trats, for the &s;pace of three hundred years, might have taken &s;ome care of the Commonwealth, if they had thought it wholly depended upon one of them: But believing it would be well enough govern'd by others, they neglected it. <HI>Camillus, Cincinnatus, Papirius, Fabius, Rullus</HI> and <HI>Maximus, Scipio Africanus, Amilcar, Hannibal, Pericles, Themi&s;tocles, Alcibiades, Epaminondas, Philopemen,</HI> and others, might have prov'd able Men in affairs of War or Government; but they were remov'd from their Offices before they under&s;tood them, and mu&s;t needs be excel'd in both by Princes, tho of duller under&s;tanding. This may be enough to excu&s;e them for performing their Duty &s;o &s;lackly and meanly: But 'tis &s;trange that <HI>Tacitus,</HI> and others, &s;hould &s;o far overlook the Rea&s;on, and &s;o gro&s;ly mi&s;take the matter of Fact, as not only to &s;ay, that great and excellent Spirits fail'd when Liberty was lo&s;t, and all Preferments given to tho&s;e who were mo&s;t propen&s;e to Slavery; but that there wanted men <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tacit.

This was the &s;tudy then in reque&s;t; and the mo&s;t cunning in this Art were call'd <HI>Scientes temporum:</HI> No other wi&s;dom was e&s;teem'd in that and the en&s;uing Ages, and no more was re|quir'd, &s;ince the Paternal Care, deep Wi&s;dom, and profound Judgment of the Princes provided for all; and tho they were of duller under&s;tand|ings, they mu&s;t needs excel other Magi&s;trats, who having bin created only for a year, left their Offices before they could under&s;tand the Dutys of them.

<PB N="195" REF="201">
had flouri&s;h'd in all manner of Vertue, as much or more than any that   has bin yet known in the world, produc'd no more; the Di&s;ciplin was di&s;&s;olv'd that nouri&s;h'd it; no man could hope to advance a publick Good, or obviate an Evil by his diligence and valor; and he who acquir'd repu|tation by either, could expect no other reward than a cruel death. If <HI>Germanicus</HI> and <HI>Corbulo,</HI> who were born when Liberty was expiring, be brought for Examples again&s;t the fir&s;t part of my A&s;&s;ertion, their ends will ju&s;tify the latter; and no eminent <HI>Roman</HI> Family is known to have brought forth a man that de&s;erv'd to be nam'd in Hi&s;tory &s;ince their time. This is as probable in rea&s;on, as true in fact. Men are valiant and indu|&s;trious, when they fight for them&s;elves and their Country; they prove excellent in all the Arts of War and Peace, when they are bred up in ver|tuous Exerci&s;es, and taught by their Fathers and Ma&s;ters to rejoice in the Honors gain'd by them: they love their Country, when the good of every particular man is comprehended in the publick Pro&s;perity, and the &s;ucce&s;s of their Atchievements is improv'd to the general advantage: They undertake hazards and labors for the Government, when 'tis ju&s;t|ly admini&s;ter'd; when Innocence is &s;afe, and Vertue honour'd; when no man is di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the vulgar, but &s;uch as have di&s;tingui&s;h'd them&s;elves by the bravery of their actions; when no honor is thought too great for tho&s;e who do it eminently, unle&s;s it be &s;uch as cannot be communicated to others of equal merit: They do not &s;pare their Per&s;ons, Pur&s;es, or Friends, when the publick Powers are employ'd for the pub|lick Benefit, and imprint the like affections in their Children from their Infancy. The di&s;ciplin of Obedience in which the <HI>Romans</HI> were bred, taught them to command: and few were admitted to the Magi&s;tracys of inferior rank, till they had given &s;uch proof of their Vertue as might de|&s;erve the Supreme. <HI>Cincinnatus, Camillus, Papirius, Mamercus, Fabius Maximus,</HI> were not made Dictators, that they might learn the Dutys of the Office; but becau&s;e they were judg'd to be of &s;uch Wi&s;dom, Valor, Integrity and Experience, that they might be &s;afely tru&s;ted with the highe&s;t Powers; and whil&s;t the Law reign'd, not one was advanc'd to that honor, who did not fully an&s;wer what was expected from him. By this means the City was &s;o repleni&s;h'd with men fit for the greate&s;t employ|ments, that even in its infancy, when three hundred and &s;ix of the <HI>Fabii, Quorum neminem,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Livy, ducem &s;perneret quibu&s;libet temporibus Senatus,</HI> were kill'd in one day, the City did lament the lo&s;s, but was not &s;o weak|en'd to give any advantage to their Enemys: and when every one of tho&s;e who had bin eminent before the &s;econd Punic War, <HI>Fabius Maximus</HI> on|ly excepted, had peri&s;h'd in it, others aro&s;e in their places, who &s;ur|pa&s;t them in number, and were equal to them in Vertue. The City was a perpetual &s;pring of &s;uch men as long as Liberty la&s;ted; but that was no &s;ooner overthrown, than Vertue was torn up by the roots; the People became ba&s;e and &s;ordid, the &s;mall remains of the Nobility &s;loth&s;ul and effeminate; and their <HI>Italian</HI> A&s;&s;ociats becoming like to them, the Empire whil&s;t it &s;tood, was only &s;u&s;tain'd by the &s;trength o&s; Foreigners.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grecian</HI> Vertue had the &s;ame fate, and expir'd with Liberty: in|&s;tead of &s;uch Soldiers as in their time had no equals, and &s;uch Generals of Armys and Fleets, Legi&s;lators and Governors, as all &s;ucceeding Ages have ju&s;tly admir'd, they &s;ent out &s;warms of Fidlers, Je&s;ters, Chariot-drivers, Players, Bawds, Flatterers, Mini&s;ters of the mo&s;t impure Lu&s;ts; or idle, babling, hypocritical Philo&s;ophers, not much better than they.

  the nece&s;&s;ity our Author imagins that Princes mu&s;t needs under&s;tand matters of Government better than Magi&s;trats annually cho|&s;en, they did for the mo&s;t part prove &s;o bruti&s;h as to give them&s;elves and the World to be govern'd by &s;uch as the&s;e, and that without any great prejudice, &s;ince none could be found more ignorant, leud, and ba&s;e than them&s;elves.</P>
<P>'Tis ab&s;urd to impute this to the change of times; for time changes no|thing; and nothing was chang'd in tho&s;e times but the Government, and that chang'd all things. This is not accidental, but according to the rules given to Nature by God, impo&s;ing upon all things a nece&s;&s;ity of perpetu|ally following their Cau&s;es. Fruits are always of the &s;ame nature with the Seeds and Roots from which they come, and Trees are known by the fruits they bear: As a Man begets a Man, and a Bea&s;t a Bea&s;t; that Society of Men which con&s;titutes a Government upon the foundation of Ju&s;tice, Vertue, and the common Good, will always have men to pro|mote tho&s;e ends; and that which intends the advancement of one man's de&s;ires and vanity, will abound in tho&s;e that will foment them. Men follow that which &s;eems advantageous to them&s;elves. Such as are bred under a good di&s;ciplin, and &s;ee that all benefits procur'd to their Country by vertuous Actions, redound to the honor and advantage of them&s;elves, their Children, Friends, and Relations, contract from their infancy a love to the Publick, and look upon the common Concernments as their own. When they have learnt to be vertuous, and &s;ee that Vertue is in e&s;teem, they &s;eek no other preferments than &s;uch as may be obtain'd that way; and no Country ever wanted great numbers of excellent men, where this method was e&s;tabli&s;h'd. On the other &s;ide, when 'tis evident that the be&s;t are de&s;pis'd, hated, or mark'd out for de&s;truction; all things calculated to the humor or advantage of one man, who is often the wor&s;t, or govern'd by the wor&s;t; Honors, Riches, Commands, and Dignitys di&s;pos'd by his Will, and his favor gain'd only by a mo&s;t ob&s;equious re|&s;pect, or a pretended affection to his per&s;on, together with a &s;ervile obe|dience to his commands, all Applications to vertuous Actions will cea&s;e; and no man caring to render him&s;elf or his Children worthy of great Im|ployments, &s;uch as de&s;ire to have them will, by little intrigues, corrup|tion, &s;currility and flattery, endeavour to make way to them; by which means true Merit in a &s;hort time comes to be aboli&s;h'd, as fell out in <HI>Rome</HI> as &s;oon as the <HI>Cae&s;ars</HI> began to reign.</P>
<P>He who dos not believe this, may &s;ee whether the like did not happen in all the other Commonwealths of <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Greece;</HI> or if modern exam|ples are thought to be of more value, let him examin whether the No|blemen of <HI>Venice,</HI> who are born and bred in Familys that never knew a Ma&s;ter; who act for them&s;elves, and have a part in all the good or evil that befals the Commonwealth, and know that if it be de&s;troy'd, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> mu&s;t peri&s;h, or at lea&s;t that all changes are to their prejudice, do neglect the publick Intere&s;ts, as thinking that the whole not depending upon any one of them, things will be well enough govern'd, tho they attend only their private benefit. Let it be ob&s;erv'd whether they do better under|&s;tand the common concernments, than the great men of <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Spain,</HI> who never come to the knowledg of any thing, unle&s;s they happen to be favor'd by the King or his Mini&s;ters, and know them&s;elves never to be more mi&s;erable than when their Ma&s;ter is mo&s;t pro&s;perous.

Whereas <HI>Portugal</HI> having in our age revolted from the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> no one doubts that it had bin immediately reduc'd, if the great men of <HI>Spain</HI> had not bin pleas'd with &s;uch a le&s;&s;ening of their Ma&s;ter's power, and re&s;olv'd not to repair it by the recovery of that Kingdom, or to deprive them&s;elves of an ea&s;y retreat when they &s;hould be oppre&s;t by him or his Favorites.

The brave Mon|&s;ieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> is &s;aid to have carry'd this to a greater height in his la&s;t Di&s;cour&s;e to the pre&s;ent King of <HI>France:</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You think, &s;aid he, you have Armys, but you have none; the one half of the Officers are the Baw|dy-hou&s;e Companions of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de xxx,</HI> or the Creatures of his Whore Madam <HI>de xxx:</HI> the other half may be men of experience, and fit for their Imployments; but they are &s;uch as would be pleas'd with nothing more than to &s;ee you lo&s;e two or three Battels, that com|ing to &s;tand in need of them, you might cau&s;e them to be better us'd by your Mini&s;ters than of late they have bin."</Q> It may ea&s;ily be ima|gin'd how men in &s;uch &s;entiments do &s;erve their Ma&s;ter; and nothing is more evident than that the <HI>French</HI> in this age have had &s;o great advanta|ges, that they might have brought <HI>Europe,</HI> and perhaps <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> under their power, if the intere&s;t of the Nation had bin united to that of the Go|vernment, and the Strength, Vigor, and Bravery of the Nobility em|ploy'd that way. But &s;ince it has pleas'd God to &s;uffer us to fall into a condition of being little able to help our &s;elves, and that they are in &s;o good terms with the <HI>Turk</HI> as not to attack him, 'tis our happine&s;s that they do not know their own &s;trength, or cannot without ruin to them&s;elves turn it to our prejudice.</P>
<P>I could give yet more pregnant te&s;timonys of the difference between men fighting for their own intere&s;ts in the Offices to which they had bin advanc'd by the votes of numerous A&s;&s;emblys, and &s;uch as &s;erve for pay, and get preferments by corruption or favor, if I were not unwilling to &s;tir the &s;pleen of &s;ome men, by obliging them to reflect upon what has pa&s;t in our own Age and Country; to compare the Ju&s;tice of our Tribunals within the time of our memory, and the integrity of tho&s;e who for a while manag'd the publick Trea&s;ure; the Di&s;ciplin, Valor and Strength
<PB N="198" REF="204">
  of our Armys and Fleets; the increa&s;e of our Riches and Trade; the &s;ucce&s;s of our Wars in <HI>Scotland, Ireland,</HI> and at Sea; the glory and reputation not long &s;ince gain'd, with that condition into which we are of late fallen. But I think, I &s;hall offend no wi&s;e or good man, if I &s;ay, that as neither the <HI>Romans</HI> nor <HI>Grecians</HI> in the time of their Liberty ever perform'd any actions more glorious than freeing the Country from a Civil War that had rag'd in every part, the conque&s;t of two &s;uch Kingdoms as <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and cru&s;hing the formidable power of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> by Sea; nor ever produc'd more examples of Valor, Indu&s;try, Integrity, and in all re&s;pects compleat, di&s;intere&s;ted, unmoveable and incorruptible Ver|tue than were at that time &s;een in our Nation: So neither of them upon the change of their Affairs did exceed us in weakne&s;s, cowardice, ba&s;e|ne&s;s, venality, leudne&s;s, and all manner of corruption. We have rea&s;on therefore not only to believe that all Princes do not nece&s;&s;arily under&s;tand the affairs of their People, or provide better for them than tho&s;e who are otherwi&s;e cho&s;en; but that as there is nothing of Greatne&s;s, Power, Riches, Strength, and Happine&s;s, which we might not rea&s;onably have hop'd for if we had rightly improv'd the advantages we had; &s;o there is nothing of &s;hame and mi&s;ery which we may not ju&s;tly fear, &s;ince we have neglected them.</P>
<P>If any man think that this evil of advancing Officers for per&s;onal re|&s;pects, favor or corruption, is not of great extent, I de&s;ire him to con&s;i|der, that the Officers of State, Courts of Ju&s;tice, Church, Armys, Fleets and Corporations, are of &s;uch number and power as wholly to corrupt a Nation when they them&s;elves are corrupted; and will ever be corrupt, when they attain to their Offices by corruption. The good management of all Affairs, Civil, Military, and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, nece&s;&s;ari|ly depends upon good order and di&s;ciplin; and 'tis not in the power of common men to reform abu&s;es patroniz'd by tho&s;e in Authority, nor to prevent the mi&s;chiefs thereupon en&s;uing; and not having power to direct publick actions to the publick good, they mu&s;t con&s;equently want the indu&s;try and affection that is requir'd to bring them to a good i&s;&s;ue. The <HI>Romans</HI> were ea&s;ily beaten under the <HI>Decemviri,</HI> tho immediately before the erection, and after the extinction of that Power, none of their Neighbours were able to re&s;i&s;t them. The <HI>Goths,</HI> who with much Glory had reign'd in <HI>Spain</HI> for about three hundred years, had neither &s;trength nor courage under their leud and odious King <HI>Rodrigo,</HI> and were in one day &s;ubdu'd with little lo&s;s of blood by the <HI>Saracens,</HI> and could not in le&s;s than eight hundred years free their Country from them. That brave Nation having of late fallen under as ba&s;e a conduct, has now as little heart or power to defend it &s;elf: Court-Para&s;ites have render'd Valor ridiculous; and they who have ever &s;hew'd them&s;elves as much inclin'd to Arms as any people of the world, do now abhor them, and are &s;ent to the Wars by force, laid in Carts, bound like Calves brought to the Shambles, and left to &s;tarve in <HI>Flanders</HI> as &s;oon as they arrive. It may ea&s;ily be judg'd what &s;ervice can be expected from &s;uch men, tho they &s;hould happen to be well commanded: but the great Officers, by the corruption of the Court, think only of enriching them&s;elves; and encrea&s;ing the mi&s;ery of the Soldiers by their frauds, both become equally u&s;ele&s;s to the State.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the &s;eeming pro&s;perity of <HI>France,</HI> matters there are not much better manag'd. The warlike temper of that people is &s;o worn out by the frauds and crueltys of corrupt Officers, that few men li&s;t them|&s;elves willingly to be Soldiers; and when they are engag'd or forc'd, they
<PB N="199" REF="205">
are &s;o little able to endure the mi&s;erys to which they are expos'd, that   they daily run away from their Colors, tho they know not whither to go, and expect no mercy if they are taken. The King has in vain at|tempted to correct this humor by the &s;everity of martial Law; but mens minds will not be forc'd; and tho his Troops are perfectly well arm'd, cloth'd, and exercis'd, they have given many te&s;timonys of little worth. When the Prince of <HI>Cond&eacute;</HI> had by his own Valor, and the Strength of the King's Guards, broken the fir&s;t line of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Army at the battel of <HI>Seneff,</HI> he could not make the &s;econd and third line of his own Army to advance and reinforce the fir&s;t, by which means he lo&s;t all the fair hopes he had conceiv'd of an intire Victory. Not long after, the Mare&s;chal <HI>de Crequi</HI> was abandon'd by his whole Army near <HI>Trier,</HI> who ran away, hardly &s;triking a &s;troke, and left him with &s;ixteen hor&s;e to &s;hift for him&s;elf. When <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Turenne,</HI> by the excellency of his Conduct and Valor, had gain'd &s;uch a Reputation among&s;t the Soldiers, that they thought them&s;elves &s;ecure under him, he did not &s;uffer &s;uch di&s;graces; but he being kill'd, they return'd to the u&s;ual temper of forc'd and ill-us'd Soldiers: half the Army was lo&s;t in a retreat, little differing from a flight; and the re&s;t, as they them&s;elves confe&s;s, &s;av'd by the bra|very of two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Regiments. The Prince of <HI>Cond&eacute;</HI> was &s;oon after &s;ent to command; but he could not with all his courage, skill and repu|tation, rai&s;e their fallen Spirits, nor pre&s;erve his Army any other way, than by lodging them in a Camp near <HI>Schle&s;tadt,</HI> &s;o fortify'd by Art and Nature that it could not be forc'd.</P>
<P>To the&s;e we may add &s;ome Examples of our own. In our late War the <HI>Scots</HI> Foot, whether Friends or Enemys, were much inferior to tho&s;e of the Parliament, and their Hor&s;e e&s;teem'd as nothing. Yet in the year 1639 and 1640, the King's Army, tho very numerous, excellently arm'd and mounted, and in appearance able to conquer many &s;uch King|doms as <HI>Scotland,</HI> being under the conduct of Courtiers, and affected as men u&s;ually are towards tho&s;e that u&s;e them ill, and &s;eek to de&s;troy them, they could never re&s;i&s;t a wretched Army commanded by <HI>Leven;</HI> but were &s;hamefully beaten at <HI>Newborn,</HI> and left the Northern Countys to be ravag'd by them.</P>
<P>When <HI>Van Tromp</HI> &s;et upon <HI>Blake</HI> in <HI>Fole&s;ton-Bay,</HI> the Parliament had not above thirteen Ships again&s;t three&s;core, and not a man that had ever &s;een any other fight at Sea, than between a Merchant-&s;hip and a Pirat, to op|po&s;e the be&s;t Captain in the world, attended with many others in valor and experience not much in&s;erior to him. Many other difficultys were ob&s;erv'd in the un&s;etled State: Few Ships, want of Mony, &s;everal Fa|ctions, and &s;ome who to advance particular Intere&s;ts betray'd the Publick. But &s;uch was the power of Wi&s;dom and Integrity in tho&s;e that &s;at at the Helm, and their diligence in chu&s;ing men only for their Merit, was ble&s;t with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that in two years our Fleets grew to be as famous as our Land Armys; the Reputation and Power of our Nation ro&s;e to a grea|ter height, than when we po&s;&s;e&s;t the better half of <HI>France,</HI> and the Kings of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> were our Pri&s;oners. All the States, Kings and Potentates of <HI>Europe,</HI> mo&s;t re&s;pectfully, not to &s;ay &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively, &s;ought our Friend&s;hip; and <HI>Rome</HI> was more afraid of <HI>Blake</HI> and his Fleet, than they had bin of the great King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> when he was ready to invade <HI>Italy</HI> with a hundred thou&s;and men. This was the work of tho&s;e, who, if our Author &s;ays true, <HI>thought ba&s;ely of the publick Concernments;</HI> and believing things might be well enough manag'd by others, minded only
<PB N="200" REF="206">
  their private Affairs. The&s;e were the effects of the negligence and igno|rance of tho&s;e, who being &s;uddenly advanc'd to Offices, were remov'd before they under&s;tood the Dutys of them. The&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es, which pro|ceed from popular corruption and irregularity, were certainly cur'd by the re&s;titution of that Integrity, good Order and Stability that accompany divine Monarchy. The Ju&s;tice of the War made again&s;t <HI>Holland</HI> in the year 1665; the probity of the Gentleman, who without partiality or bribery, cho&s;e the mo&s;t part of the Officers that carry'd it on; the Wi&s;|dom, Diligence and Valor manife&s;ted in the conduct, and the Glory with which it was ended, ju&s;tifys all that our Author can &s;ay in its commenda|tion. If any doubt remains, the &s;ubtilty of making the King of <HI>France</HI> de&s;ire that the <HI>Netherlands</HI> might be an acce&s;&s;ion to his Crown; the inge|nious ways taken by us to facilitate the conque&s;t of them; the Indu&s;try of our Emba&s;&s;adors in diverting the <HI>Spaniards</HI> from entring into the War till it was too late to recover the Lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tain'd; the honourable De&s;ign upon the <HI>Smyrna</HI> Fleet, and our frankne&s;s in taking the quarrel upon our &s;elves, together with the important Figure we now make in <HI>Europe,</HI> may wholly remove it; and in confirmation of our Author's Doctrin, &s;hew, that Princes do better perform the Offices that require Wi&s;dom, Indu&s;try and Valor, than annual Magi&s;trats; and do more &s;eldom err in the choice of Officers, than Senats and popular A&s;&s;emblys.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXIX. There is no a&s;&s;urance that the Di&s;tempers of a State &s;hall be cur'd by the Wi&s;dom of a Prince.</HEAD>
<P><HI>B&V;T,</HI> &s;ays our Author, <HI>the Vertue and Wi&s;dom of a Prince &s;upplys all. Tho he were of a duller under&s;tanding, by u&s;e and experience he mu&s;t needs excel all:</HI> Nature, Age, or Sex, are, as it &s;eems, nothing to the ca&s;e. A Child as &s;oon as he comes to be a King, has experience; the head of a Fool is fill'd with Wi&s;dom, as &s;oon as a Crown is &s;et upon it, and the mo&s;t vicious do in a moment become vertuous. This is more &s;trange than that an A&s;s being train'd to a Cour&s;e, &s;hould outrun the be&s;t <HI>Arabian</HI> Hor&s;e; or a Hare bred up in an Army, become more &s;trong and fierce than a Lion: for Fortune dos not only &s;upply all natural defects in Princes, and correct their vices, but gives them the benefit of u&s;e and experience when they have none. Some Rea&s;ons and Examples might have bin expected to prove this extraordinary Propo&s;ition: But according to his laudable cu&s;tom, he is pleas'd to trouble him&s;elf with neither; and thinks that the impudence of an A&s;&s;ertion is &s;ufficient to make that to pa&s;s, which is repugnant to experience and common &s;en&s;e, as may appear by the following di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>I will not in&s;i&s;t upon terms; for tho <HI>duller under&s;tanding</HI> &s;igni&s;ys no|thing, in as much as no under&s;tanding is dull, and a man is &s;aid to be dull only becau&s;e he wants it; but pre&s;uming he means little under&s;tanding, I &s;hall &s;o take it. This defect may po&s;&s;ibly be repair'd in time; but to conclude it mu&s;t be &s;o, is ab&s;urd, for no one has this u&s;e and experience when he begins to reign. At that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ime many Errors may be committed to the ruin of him&s;elf or people, and many have peri&s;h'd even in their be|ginning. <HI>Edward</HI> the fifth and &s;ixth of <HI>England, Francis</HI> the &s;econd of
<PB N="201" REF="207">
<HI>France,</HI> and divers other Kings have dy'd in the beginning of their youth:   <HI>Charles</HI> the ninth liv'd only to add the furys of youth to the follys of his childhood; and our <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;econd, <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;econd, <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, and <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, &s;eem to have bin little wi&s;er in the la&s;t, than in the fir&s;t year of their Reign or Life. The pre&s;ent Kings of <HI>Spain, France,</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI> came to the Crowns they wear before the &s;ixth year of their Age; and if they did then &s;urpa&s;s all annual Magi&s;trats in Wi&s;|dom and Valor, it was by a peculiar Gift of God, which, for any thing we know, is not given to every King, and it was not U&s;e and Experi|ence that made them to excel. If it be pretended that this Experience, with the Wi&s;dom that it gives, comes in time and by degrees; I may mode&s;tly ask, what time is requir'd to render a Prince excellent in Wi&s;|dom who is a Child or a Fool? and who will give &s;ecurity that he &s;hall live to that time, or that the Kingdom &s;hall not be ruin'd in the time of his folly? I may al&s;o doubt how our Author, who concludes that every King in time mu&s;t needs become excellent in Wi&s;dom, can be reconcil'd to <HI>Solomon,</HI> who in preferring a wi&s;e Child before an old and fooli&s;h King that will not be advis'd, &s;hews that an old King may be a Fool, and he that will not be advis'd is one. Some are &s;o naturally bruti&s;h and &s;tupid, that neither education nor time will mend them. 'Tis probable that <HI>Solomon</HI> took what care he could to in&s;truct his only Son <HI>Rehoboam;</HI> but he was certainly a Fool at forty years of age, and we have no rea&s;on to believe that he de&s;erv'd a better name. He &s;eems to have bin the very Fool his Father intended, who tho bray'd in a mortar would never leave his folly: He would not be advis'd, tho the hand of God was again&s;t him; ten Tribes revolted from him, and the City and Temple was pil|lag'd by the <HI>Egyptians.</HI> Neither experience nor afflictions could mend him, and he is call'd to this day by his own Countrymen <HI>Stultitia Gen|tium.</HI> I might offend tender ears, if I &s;hould alledg all the Examples of Princes mention'd in Hi&s;tory, or known in our own Age, who have liv'd and dy'd as fooli&s;h and incorrigible as he: but no man, I pre&s;ume, will be &s;candaliz'd if I &s;ay, that the ten la&s;t Kings of <HI>Meroveus</HI> his Race, whom the <HI>French</HI> Hi&s;torians call <HI>Les Roys faineants,</HI> were &s;o far from ex|celling other men in under&s;tanding, that they liv'd and dy'd more like bea&s;ts than men. Nay, the Wi&s;dom and Valor of <HI>Charles Martel</HI> ex|pir'd in his Grandchild <HI>Charles</HI> the Great; and his Po&s;terity grew to be &s;o &s;otti&s;h, that the <HI>French</HI> Nation mu&s;t have peri&s;h'd under their conduct, if the Nobility and People had not rejected them, and plac'd the Crown upon a more de&s;erving Head.</P>
<P>This is as much as is nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;aid to the general Propo&s;ition; for it is fal&s;e, if it be not always true; and no conclu&s;ion can be made upon it. But I need not be &s;o &s;trict with our Author, there being no one fou d part in his A&s;&s;ertion. Many Children come to be Kings when they h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">e no experience; and die, or are depos'd, before they can gain any. Many are by nature &s;o &s;otti&s;h that they can learn nothing: Others fal|ling under the power of Women, or corrupt Favorites and Mini&s;ters, are per&s;uaded and &s;educ'd from the good ways to which their own natural un|der&s;tanding or experience might lead them; the Evils drawn upon them|&s;elves or their Subjects, by the Errors committed in the time of their ig|norance, are o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ten grievous, and &s;ometimes irreparable, tho they &s;hould be made wi&s;e by time and experience. A per&s;on of royal Birth and ex|cellent Wit, was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of this as to tell me, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the condition of Kings was mo&s;t mi&s;erable, in as much as they never heard Truth till
<PB N="202" REF="208">
  they were ruin'd by Lies; and then every one was ready to tell it to them, not by way of advice, but reproach, and rather to vent their own &s;pite, than to &s;eek a remedy to the evils brought upon them and the people."</Q> Others attain to Crowns when they are of full Age, and have experience as Men, tho none as Kings; and therefore are apt to commit as great mi&s;takes as Children: And upon the whole matter all the Hi&s;torys of the world &s;hew, that in&s;tead of this profound Judgment and incomparable Wi&s;dom which our Author generally attributes to all Kings, there is no &s;ort of men that do more frequently and intirely want it.</P>
<P>But tho Kings were always wi&s;e by nature, or made to be &s;o by expe|rience, it would be of little advantage to Nations under them, unle&s;s their Wi&s;dom were pure, perfect, and acompany'd with Clemency, Magna|nimity, Ju&s;tice, Valor and Piety. Our Author him&s;elf dur&s;t hardly have &s;aid, that the&s;e Vertues or Graces are gain'd by Experience, or annex'd by God to any rank of Men or Familys. He gives them where he plea|&s;es without di&s;tinction. We &s;ometimes &s;ee tho&s;e upon Thrones, who by God and Nature &s;eem to have bin de&s;ign'd for the mo&s;t &s;ordid Offices; and tho&s;e have bin known to pa&s;s their lives in meanne&s;s and poverty, who had all the Qualitys that could be de&s;ir'd in Princes. There is like|wi&s;e a kind of ability to di&s;patch &s;ome &s;ort of Affairs, that Princes who continue long in a Throne may to a degree acquire or increa&s;e: Some men take this for Wi&s;dom, but K <HI>James</HI> more rightly call'd it by the name of <HI>Kingcraft;</HI> and as it principally con&s;i&s;ts in Di&s;&s;imulation, and the arts of working upon mens Pa&s;&s;ions, Vanitys, private Intere&s;ts or Vices, to make them for the mo&s;t part in&s;truments of Mi&s;chief, it has the advance|ment or &s;ecurity of their own Per&s;ons for its object, is frequently exercis'd with all the exce&s;&s;es of Pride, Avarice, Treachery and Cruelty; and no men have bin ever found more notoriou&s;ly to deflect from all that de&s;erves prai&s;e in a Prince, or a Gentleman, than tho&s;e that have mo&s;t excel'd in <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tacit. An. l. 11, 12.</NOTE>it. <HI>Phara&s;menes</HI> King of <HI>Iberia,</HI> is recorded by <HI>Tacitus</HI> to have bin well vers'd in this Science. His Brother <HI>Mithradates</HI> King of <HI>Armenia</HI> had marry'd his Daughter, and given his own Daughter to <HI>Rhadami&s;tus</HI> Son of <HI>Phara&s;menes.</HI> He had &s;ome Conte&s;ts with <HI>Mithradates,</HI> but by the help of the&s;e mutual Alliances, nearne&s;s of Blood, the diligence of <HI>Rhada|mi&s;tus,</HI> and an Oath, &s;trengthen'd with all the Ceremonys that among&s;t tho&s;e Nations were e&s;teem'd mo&s;t &s;acred, not to u&s;e Arms or Poi&s;on again&s;t him, all was compos'd; and by this means getting him into his power, he &s;tifled him with a great weight of clothes thrown upon him, kill'd his Children, and not long after his own Son <HI>Rhadami&s;tus</HI> al&s;o. <HI>Louis</HI> the eleventh of <HI>France, James</HI> the third of <HI>Scotland, Henry</HI> the &s;e|venth of <HI>England,</HI> were great Ma&s;ters of the&s;e Arts; and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;e who are acquainted with Hi&s;tory, will ea&s;ily judg how happy Nations would be if all Kings did in time certainly learn them.</P>
<P>Our Author, as a farther te&s;timony of his Judgment, having &s;aid that Kings mu&s;t needs excel others in Under&s;tanding, and grounded his Do|ctrin upon their profound Wi&s;dom, imputes to them tho&s;e <HI>ba&s;e and panick &s;ears</HI> which are incon&s;i&s;tent with it, or any royal Vertue: and to carry the point higher, tells us, <HI>There is no Tyrant &s;o barbarou&s;ly wicked, but his own rea&s;on and &s;en&s;e will tell him, that tho he be a God, yet he mu&s;t die like a Man; and that there is not the meane&s;t of his Subjects, but may find a means to revenge him&s;elf of the Injurys offer'd him:</HI> and from thence concludes, that <HI>there is no &s;uch Tyranny as that of a Multitude which is &s;ubject to no</HI>
<PB N="205" REF="209">
<HI>&s;ach fears.</HI> But if there be &s;uch a thing in the World, as a barbarous and   wicked Tyrant, he is &s;omething different from a King, or the &s;ame; and his Wi&s;dom is con&s;i&s;tent or incon&s;i&s;tent with Barbarity, Wickedne&s;s, and Tyranny. If there be no difference, the prai&s;es he gives, and the rights he a&s;cribes to the one belong al&s;o to the other: and the excellency of Wi&s;dom may con&s;i&s;t with Barbarity, Wickedne&s;s, Tyranny, and the panick fears that accompany them; which hitherto have bin thought to comprehend the utmo&s;t exce&s;&s;es of Folly and Madne&s;s; and I know no better te&s;timony of the truth of that Opinion, than that Wi&s;dom always di&s;tingui&s;hing good from evil, and being &s;een only in the rectitude of that di&s;tinction, in following and adhering to the good, rejecting that which is evil, preferring &s;afety before danger, happine&s;s before mi&s;ery, and in knowing rightly how to u&s;e the means of attaining or pre&s;erving the one, and preventing or avoiding the other, there cannot be a more extravagant deviation from Rea&s;on, than for a man, who in a private condition might live &s;afely and happily, to invade a Principality: or if he be a Prince, who by governing with Ju&s;tice and Clemency might obtain the inward &s;atisfaction of his own Mind, hope for the ble&s;&s;ing of God upon his ju&s;t and vertuous Actions, acquire the love and prai&s;es of men, and live in &s;afety and happine&s;s among&s;t his &s;afe and happy Subjects, to fall into that Barbarity, Wickedne&s;s, and Tyranny, which brings upon him the di&s;|plea&s;ure of God, and dete&s;tation of men, and which is always attended with tho&s;e ba&s;e and panick fears, that comprehend all that is &s;hameful and mi&s;erable. This being perceiv'd by <HI>Machiavel,</HI> he could not think <NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;cor&s;. &s;opra T. Liv. l. 1. c. 10.</NOTE>that any man in his &s;en&s;es would not rather be a <HI>Scipio</HI> than a <HI>Ce&s;ar;</HI> or if he came to be a Prince, would not rather chu&s;e to imitate <HI>Age&s;ilaus, Ti|moleon,</HI> or <HI>Dion,</HI> than <HI>Nabis, Phalaris,</HI> or <HI>Diony&s;ius;</HI> and imputes the contrary choice to madne&s;s. Neverthele&s;s 'tis too well known that ma|ny of our Author's profound wi&s;e men in the depth of their Judgment, made perfect by u&s;e and experience, have fallen into it.</P>
<P>If there be a difference between this barbarous wicked Tyrant, and a King, we are to examin who is the Tyrant, and who the King; for the name confer'd or a&s;&s;um'd cannot make a King, unle&s;s he be one. He who is not a King, can have no Title to the rights belonging to him who is truly a King: &s;o that a People who find them&s;elves wickedly and barbarou&s;ly oppre&s;t by a Tyrant, may de&s;troy him and his Tyranny without giving offence to any King.</P>
<P>But 'tis &s;trange that <HI>Filmer</HI> &s;hould &s;peak of the Barbarity and Wicked|ne&s;s of a Tyrant, who looks upon the World to be the Patrimony of one man; and for the foundation of his Doctrin, a&s;&s;erts &s;uch a power in eve|ry one that makes him&s;elf ma&s;ter of any part, as cannot be limited by any Law. His Title is not to be que&s;tion'd; U&s;urpation and Violence confer an inconte&s;table Right: the exerci&s;e of his Power is no more to be di&s;puted than the Acqui&s;ition: his will is a Law to his Subjects; and no Law can be impos'd by them upon his Conduct. For if the&s;e things be true, I know not how any man could ever be call'd a Tyrant, that name having never bin given to any unle&s;s for u&s;urping a Power that did not be|long to him, or an unju&s;t exerci&s;e of that which had bin confer'd upon him, and violating the Laws which ought to be a rule to him. 'Tis al&s;o hard to imagin how any man can be call'd barbarous and wicked, if he be oblig'd by no Law but that of his own Plea&s;ure; for we have no other notion of wrong, than that it is a breach of the Law which determins what is right. If the lives and goods of Subjects depend upon the Will
<PB N="206" REF="210">
  of the Prince, and he in his profound Wi&s;dom pre&s;erve them only to be beneficial to him&s;elf, they can have no other right than what he gives, and without inju&s;tice may retain when he thinks fit: If there be no wrong, there can be no ju&s;t revenge; and he that pretends to &s;eek it, is not a free man vindicating his Right, but a perver&s;e &s;lave ri&s;ing up again&s;t his Ma&s;ter. But if there be &s;uch a thing as a barbarous and wicked Ty|rant, there mu&s;t be a rule relating to the acqui&s;ition and exerci&s;e of the Power, by which he may be di&s;tingui&s;h'd from a ju&s;t King; and a Law &s;uperior to his Will, by the violation of which he becomes barbarous and wicked.</P>
<P>Tho our Author &s;o &s;ar forgets him&s;elf, to confe&s;s this to be true, he &s;eeks to de&s;troy the fruits of it by &s;uch flattery as comprehends all that is mo&s;t dete&s;table in Profanene&s;s and Bla&s;phemy, and gives the name of Gods to the mo&s;t execrable of men. He may by &s;uch language de&s;erve the name of <HI>Heylin</HI>'s Di&s;ciple; but will find few among the Heathens &s;o ba&s;e|ly &s;ervile, or &s;o boldly impious. Tho <HI>Claudius Ce&s;ar</HI> was a drunken &s;ot, and tran&s;ported with the extravagance of his Fortune, he dete&s;ted the im|pudence of his Predece&s;&s;or <HI>Caligula,</HI> (who affected that Title) and in his Re&s;cript to the Procurator of <HI>Judea,</HI> gives it no better name than <HI>turpem Caii in&s;aniam.</HI> For this rea&s;on it was rejected by all his Pagan Succe&s;&s;ors, who were not as furiou&s;ly wicked as he: yet <HI>Filmer</HI> has thought fit to renew it, for the benefit of Mankind, and the Glory of the Chri&s;tian Religion.</P>
<P>I know not whether the&s;e extreme and barbarous Errors of our Au|thor are to be imputed to wickedne&s;s or madne&s;s; or whether, to &s;ave the pains of a di&s;tinction, they may not rightly be &s;aid to be the &s;ame thing: but nothing le&s;s than the exce&s;s of both could induce him to attri|bute any thing of good to the fears of a Tyrant, &s;ince they are the chief cau&s;es of all the mi&s;chiefs he dos. <HI>Tertullian</HI> &s;ays they are <HI>Metu quam fu|rore &s;aeviores;</HI> and <HI>Tacitus,</HI> &s;peaking of a mo&s;t wicked King, &s;ays, that he did <HI>Saevitiam ignaviae obtendere:</HI> and we do not more certainly find that Cowards are the cruelle&s;t of men, than that wickedne&s;s makes them Cowards; that every man's fears bear a proportion with his guilt, and with the number, vertue, and &s;trength of tho&s;e he has offended. He who u&s;urps a power over all, or abu&s;es a Tru&s;t repos'd in him by all, in the highe&s;t mea&s;ure offends all; he fears and hates tho&s;e he has offended, and to &s;ecure him&s;elf, aggravates the former Injurys: When the&s;e are publick, they beget a univer&s;al Hatred, and every man de&s;ires to extin|gui&s;h a Mi&s;chief that threatens ruin to all. This will always be terrible to one that knows he has de&s;erv'd it; and when tho&s;e he dreads are the body of the People, nothing but a publick de&s;truction can &s;atisfy his rage, and appea&s;e his fears.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h I could agree with <HI>Filmer,</HI> in exempting multitudes from fears; for they having &s;eldom committed any inju&s;tice, unle&s;s thro fear, would, as far as human fragility permits, be free from it. Tho the <HI>Attick O&s;traci&s;m</HI> was not an extreme Puni&s;hment, I know nothing u&s;ually practis'd in any Commonwealth, that did &s;o much &s;avor of inju&s;tice: but it proceeded &s;olely from a fear that one man, tho in appearance vertuous, when he came to be rais'd too much above his fellow-Citizens, might be tempted to invade the publick Liberty. We do not find that the <HI>Athenians,</HI> or any other free Citys, ever injur'd any man, unle&s;s thro &s;uch a jealou&s;y, or the perjury of Witne&s;&s;es, by which the be&s;t Tribunals that ever were, or can be e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the world, may be mi&s;led; and no inju&s;tice could
<PB N="207" REF="211">
be apprehended from any, if they did not fall into &s;uch fears.  </P>
<P>But tho Multitudes may have fears as well as Tyrants, the Cau&s;es and Effects of them are very different. A People, in relation to dome&s;tick Affairs, can de&s;ire nothing but Liberty, and neither hate or fear any but &s;uch as do, or would, as they &s;u&s;pect, deprive them of that Happine&s;s: Their endeavors to &s;ecure that &s;eldom hurt any except &s;uch as invade their Rights; and if they err, the mi&s;take is for the mo&s;t part di&s;cover'd be|fore it produce any mi&s;chief; and the greate&s;t that ever came that way, was the death of one, or a few men. Their Hatred and de&s;ire of Revenge can go no farther than the &s;en&s;e of the Injury receiv'd or fear'd, and is extingui&s;h'd by the death or bani&s;hment of the Per&s;ons; as may be ga|ther'd from the examples of the <HI>Tarquins, Decemviri, Ca&s;&s;ius, Melius,</HI> and <HI>Manlius Capitolinus.</HI> He therefore that would know whether the hatred and fear of a Tyrant, or of a People, produces the greater mi&s;|chiefs, needs only to con&s;ider, whether it be better that the Tyrant de|&s;troy the People, or that the People de&s;troy the Tyrant: or at the wor&s;t, whether one that is &s;u&s;pected of affecting the Tyranny &s;hould peri&s;h, or a whole People, among&s;t whom very many are certainly innocent; and experience &s;hows that &s;uch are always fir&s;t &s;ought out to be de&s;troy'd for being &s;o: Popular furys or fears, how irregular or unju&s;t &s;oever they may be, can extend no farther; general Calamitys can only be brought upon a People by tho&s;e who are enemys to the whole Body, which can never be the Multitude, for they are that Body. In all other re&s;pects, the fears that render a Tyrant cruel, render a People gentle and cautious; for every &s;ingle man knowing him&s;elf to be of little power, not only fears to do in|ju&s;tice becau&s;e it may be reveng'd upon his Per&s;on, by him, or his Friends, Kindred and Relations, that &s;uffers it; but becau&s;e it tends to the over|throw of the Government, which comprehends all publick and private Concernments, and which every man knows cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t unle&s;s it be &s;o ea&s;y and gentle, as to be plea&s;ing to tho&s;e who are the be&s;t, and have the greate&s;t power: and as the publick Con&s;iderations divert them from do|ing tho&s;e Injurys that may bring immediate prejudice to the Publick, &s;o there are &s;trict Laws to re&s;train all &s;uch as would do private Injurys. If neither the People nor the Magi&s;trats of <HI>Venice, Switzerland,</HI> and <HI>Hol|land,</HI> commit &s;uch extravagances as are u&s;ual in other places, it dos not perhaps proceed from the temper of tho&s;e Nations different from others, but from a knowledg, that who&s;oever offers an injury to a private per&s;on, or attempts a publick mi&s;chief, is expos'd to the impartial and inexorable Power of the Law; whereas the chief work of an ab&s;olute Monarch is to place him&s;elf above the Law, and thereby rendring him&s;elf the Au|thor of all the evils that the People &s;uffer, 'tis ab&s;urd to expect that he &s;hould remove them.</P>

<P>OUR Author's next &s;tep is not only to reject Popular Governments, but all &s;uch Monarchys as are not ab&s;olute: <HI>for if the King,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>admits the People to be his Companions, he leaves to be a King.</HI> This

<P>1. It &s;eems ab&s;urd to &s;peak of Kings admitting the Nobility or People to part of the Government: for tho there may be, and are Nations with|out Kings, yet no man can conceive a King without a People. The&s;e mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have all the power originally in them&s;elves; and tho Kings may and often have a power of granting Honors, Immunitys, and Privileges to private Men or Corporations, he dos it only out of the publick Stock, which he is entru&s;ted to di&s;tribute; but can give nothing to the People, who give to him all that he can rightly have.</P>
<P>2. 'Tis &s;trange that he who frequently cites <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> and <HI>Plato,</HI> &s;hould unluckily acknowledg &s;uch only to be Kings as they call Tyrants, and deny the name of King to tho&s;e, who in their opinion are the only Kings.</P>
<P>3. I cannot under&s;tand why the Scripture &s;hould call tho&s;e Kings who&s;e Powers were limited, if they only are Kings who are ab&s;olute; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 17.</NOTE>or why <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> did appoint that the power of Kings in <HI>I&s;rael</HI> &s;hould be li|mited (if they re&s;olv'd to have them) if that limitation de&s;troy'd the be|ing of a King.</P>
<P>4. And la&s;tly, how he knows that in the Kingdoms which have a &s;hew of Popularity, the Power is wholly in the King.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t point was prov'd when we examin'd the beginning of Monar|chys, and found it impo&s;&s;ible that there could be any thing of ju&s;tice in them, unle&s;s they were e&s;tabli&s;h'd by the common con&s;ent of tho&s;e who were to live under them; or that they could make any &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hment, unle&s;s the right and power were in them.</P>
<P>Secondly, Neither <HI>Plato</HI> nor <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> acknowledg either rea&s;on or ju|&s;tice in the power of a Monarch, unle&s;s he has more of the Vertues con|ducing to the good of the Civil Society than all tho&s;e who compo&s;e it; and employ them for the publick advantage, and not to his own plea&s;ure and profit, as being &s;et up by tho&s;e who &s;eek their own good, for no other rea&s;on than that he &s;hould procure it. To this end a Law is &s;et as a rule to him, and the be&s;t men, that is &s;uch as are mo&s;t like to him&s;elf, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Plat. de Leg. Ari&s;t. Polit.</NOTE>made to be his A&s;&s;i&s;tants, becau&s;e, &s;ay they, <HI>Lex e&s;t mens &s;ine affectu, &amp; qua&s;i Deus;</HI> whereas the be&s;t of men have their affections and pa&s;&s;ions, and are &s;ubject to be mi&s;led by them: Which &s;hews, that as the Monarch is not for him&s;elf nor by him&s;elf, he dos not give, but receive power, nor ad|mit others to the participation of it, but is by them admitted to what he has. Whereupon they conclude, that to prefer the ab&s;olute power of a man, as in tho&s;e Governments which they call <HI>Barbarorum regna,</HI> be|fore the regular Government of Kings ju&s;tly exerci&s;ing a power in&s;ti|tuted by Law, and directed to the publick good, is to chu&s;e rather to be &s;ubject to the lu&s;t of a Bea&s;t, than to be govern'd by a God. And becau&s;e &s;uch a choice can only be made by a Bea&s;t, I leave our Author to find a de|&s;cription of him&s;elf in their Books, which he &s;o often cites.</P>
<P>But if <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> de&s;erves credit, the Princes who reign for them&s;elves and not for the People, preferring their own plea&s;ure or profit before the publick, become Tyrants; which in his language is Enemys to God and

<P>In the third place, The Scriptures declare the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;etting bounds to tho&s;e who are plac'd in the highe&s;t dignitys. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;eems to have had as great abilitys as any man that ever liv'd in the world; but he alone was not able to bear the weight of the Government, and therefore God ap|pointed Seventy cho&s;en men to be his a&s;&s;i&s;tants. This was a perpetual Law to <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> and as no King was to have more power than <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> or more abilitys to perform the Dutys of his Office, none could be exempted from the nece&s;&s;ity of wanting the like helps. Our Author therefore mu&s;t confe&s;s that they are Kings who have them, or that Kingly Government is contrary to the Scriptures. When God by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> gave liberty to his People to make a King, he did it under the&s;e conditions. <HI>He mu&s;t be one</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 17.</NOTE><HI>of their Brethren: They mu&s;t chu&s;e him: he mu&s;t not multiply Gold, Silver, Wives, or Hor&s;es: he mu&s;t not lift up his Heart above his Brethren.</HI> And <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> paraphra&s;ing upon the place, &s;ays, <HI>He &s;hall do nothing without the</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Antiq.

They did lift up their hearts above their Brethren, which was forbidden by the Law. All the Kings of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and mo&s;t of the Kings of <HI>Judah,</HI> utterly rejected it; and every one of them did very much depart from the ob&s;ervation of it. I will not deny that the People in their in&s;titution of a King intended they &s;hould do &s;o: they had done it them&s;elves, and would have a King that might uphold them in their di&s;obedience; they were addicted to the Idolatry of their accur&s;ed Neighbours, and de&s;ir'd that Government by which it was maintain'd among&s;t them. In doing this they did not reject <HI>Samuel;</HI> but they rejected God that he &s;hould not reign over them. They might perhaps believe that unle&s;s their King were &s;uch as the Law did not per|mit, he would not perform what they intended; or that the name of King did not belong to him, unle&s;s he had a power that the Law deny'd. But &s;ince God and his Prophets give the name of King to the chief Magi&s;trate, endow'd with a power that was re&s;train'd within very narrow limits, whom they might without offence &s;et up, we al&s;o may &s;afely give the &s;ame to tho&s;e of the &s;ame nature, whether it plea&s;e <HI>Filmer</HI> or not.</P>
<P>4. The practice of mo&s;t Nations, and (I may truly &s;ay) of all that de&s;erve imitation, has bin as directly contrary to the ab&s;olute power of one man as their Con&s;titutions: or if the original of many Governments lie hid in

  the impenetrable darkne&s;s of Antiquity, their progre&s;s may &s;erve to &s;hew the intention of the Founders. <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> &s;eems to think that the fir&s;t Monarchs having bin cho&s;en for their Vertue, were little re&s;train'd in the exerci&s;e of their Power; but that they or their Children falling into Cor|ruption and Pride, grew odious; and that Nations did on that account either aboli&s;h their Authority, or create Senats and other Magi&s;trats, who having part of the Power, might keep them in order. The <HI>Spartan</HI> Kings were certainly of this nature; and the <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> till they conquer'd <HI>Babylon.</HI> Nay, I may &s;afely &s;ay, that neither the Kings which the fran|tick people &s;et up in oppo&s;ition to the Law of God, nor tho&s;e of the bor|dering Nations, who&s;e example they cho&s;e to follow, had that ab&s;olute power which our Author attributes to all Kings as in&s;eparable from the name. <HI>Achi&s;h</HI> the <HI>Phili&s;tin</HI> lov'd and admir'd <HI>David;</HI> he look'd upon him as an Angel of God, and promis'd that he &s;hould be the keeper of <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 29.</NOTE>his Head for ever: but when the Princes &s;u&s;pected him, and &s;aid <HI>he &s;hall not go down with us to Battel,</HI> he was oblig'd to di&s;mi&s;s him. This was not the language of Slaves, but of tho&s;e who had a great part in the Govern|ment; and the King's &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their will, &s;hows that he was more like to the Kings of <HI>Sparta,</HI> than to an ab&s;olute Monarch, who dos what|ever plea&s;es him. I know not whether the <HI>Spartans</HI> were de&s;cended from the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> as &s;ome think; but their Kings were under a regulati|on much like that of the 17<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Deuter.</HI> tho they had two: Their Senate of twenty eight, and the <HI>Ephori,</HI> had a power like to that of the <HI>Sanhedrin;</HI> and by them Kings were condemn'd to fines, impri&s;onment, bani&s;hment, and death, as appears by the examples of <HI>Pau&s;anias, Cleony|mus, Leonidas, Agis,</HI> and others. The <HI>Hebrew</HI> Di&s;ciplin was the &s;ame; <NOTE PLACE="marg">More Nevo|chim.</NOTE><HI>Reges Davidicae &s;tirpis,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Maimonides, judicabant &amp; judicabantur.</HI> They gave te&s;timony in judgment when they were call'd, and te&s;timony was given again&s;t them. Whereas the Kings of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> as the &s;ame Au|thor <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE>&s;ays, were <HI>&s;uperbi, corde elati, &amp; &s;pertores legis, nec judicabant, nec judicabantur;</HI> proud, in&s;olent, and contemners of the Law, who would neither judg, nor &s;ubmit to judgment as the Law commanded. But the Fruits they gather'd were &s;utable to the Seed they had &s;own, and their Crimes were not left unpuni&s;h'd: they who de&s;pis'd the Law were de&s;troy'd without Law; and when no ordinary cour&s;e could be taken again&s;t them for their exce&s;&s;es, they were overthrown by force, and the Crown within the &s;pace of few years was tran&s;ported into nine &s;everal Familys&punc; with the utter extirpation of tho&s;e that had po&s;&s;e&s;t it. On the other hand, there never was any Sedition again&s;t the <HI>Spartan</HI> Kings; and after the moderate Di&s;ciplin, according to which they liv'd, was e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd, none of them dy'd by the hands of their Subjects, except only two, who were put to death in a way of Ju&s;tice: the Kingdom continu'd in the &s;ame races, till <HI>Cleomenes</HI> was defeated by <HI>Antigonus,</HI> and the Go|vernment overthrown by the <HI>Macedonians.</HI> This gave occa&s;ion to tho&s;e be&s;tial Tyrants <HI>Nabis</HI> and <HI>Machanidas</HI> to &s;et up &s;uch a Government as our Author recommends to the World, which immediately brought de&s;tructi|on upon them&s;elves, and the whole City. The <HI>Germans,</HI> who pretend|ed to be de&s;cended from the <HI>Spartans,</HI> had the like Government. Their <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"> de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> Germ.</NOTE>Princes according to their merit had the <HI>credit of per&s;uading, not the power of commanding;</HI> and the que&s;tion was not what part of the Government they would allow to the Nobility and People, but what the Nobility and People would give to their Princes: and 'tis not much material to our pre&s;ent di&s;pute, whether they learnt this from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ome ob&s;cure knowledg of

the Law which God gave to his People, or whether led by the light of   Rea&s;on, which is al&s;o from God, they di&s;cover'd what was altogether conformable to that Law. Whoever under&s;tands the affairs of <HI>Germany,</HI> knows that the pre&s;ent Emperors, notwith&s;tandiug their haughty Title, have a power limited as in the days of <HI>Tacitus.</HI> If they are good and wi&s;e, they may per&s;uade; but they can command no farther than the Law allows. They do not admit the Princes, Noblemen, and Citys to the power which they all exerci&s;e in their general Diets, and each of them within their own Precincts; but they exerci&s;e that which has bin by publick con&s;ent be&s;tow'd upon them. All the Kingdoms peopled from the North ob&s;erv'd the &s;ame rules. In all of them the powers were divided between the Kings, the Nobility, Clergy, and Commons; and by the Decrees of Councils, Diets, Parliaments, Cortez, and A&s;&s;em|blys of E&s;tates, Authority and Liberty were &s;o balanc'd, that &s;uch Prin|ces as a&s;&s;um'd to them&s;elves more than the Law did permit, were &s;everely puni&s;h'd; and tho&s;e who did by force or fraud invade Thrones, were by force thrown down from them.</P>
<P>This was equally beneficial to Kings and People. The Powers, as <HI>Theopompus</HI> King of <HI>Sparta</HI> &s;aid, were mo&s;t &s;afe when they were lea&s;t envy'd and hated. <HI>Lewis</HI> the 11<HI>th</HI> of <HI>France</HI> was one of the fir&s;t that broke this Golden Chain; and by more &s;ubtil Arts than had bin formerly known, &s;ubverted the Laws, by which the fury of Kings had bin re|&s;train'd, and taught others to do the like; tho all of them have not &s;o well &s;av'd them&s;elves from puni&s;hment. <HI>James</HI> the third of <HI>Scotland</HI> was one of his mo&s;t apt Scholars; and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ab hominibus infimae &s;ortis in omnia &s;imul vitia e&s;t praeceps datus: tempora etiam corrupta &amp; vicinorum regum exempla non parum ad eum evertendum juverunt: Nam &amp; Edvardus in A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">glia, Car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lus in Burgundia, Ludovicus undecimus in Gallia, Joannes &s;ecundus in Lu&s;itania, tyran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">idis fundamenta jec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">runt: Richardus tertius in A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">glia eam immani&s;&s;ime exercuit. <BIBL>Hi&s;t.

This is &s;ufficiently clear by the forecited examples of <HI>Pharamond</HI>'s Grandchildren, and the degenerated Races of <HI>Meroveus</HI> and <HI>Pepin;</HI> of which many were depos'd, &s;ome of the neare&s;t in Blood excluded; and when their Vices &s;eem'd to be incorrigible, they were wholly rejected. All this was done by virtue of that rule which they call the <HI>Salique Law:</HI> And tho &s;ome of our Princes pretending to the Inheritance of that Crown by marrying the Heirs Ge|neral, deny'd that there was any &s;uch thing, no man can &s;ay that for the &s;pace of above twelve hundred years, Females, or their De&s;cendents, who are by that Law excluded, have ever bin thought to have any right to the Crown: And no Law, unle&s;s it be explicitely given by God, can be of greater Authority than one which has bin in force for &s;o many Ages. What the beginning of it was is not known: But <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;ixth reced|ing from this Law, and thinking to di&s;po&s;e of the Succe&s;&s;ion otherwi&s;e than was ordain'd by it, was e&s;teem'd mad, and all his Acts re&s;cinded. And tho the Reputation, Strength and Valor of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> commanded by <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, one of the brave&s;t Princes that have ever bin in the world, was terrible to the <HI>French</HI> Nation; yet they oppos'd him to the utmo&s;t of their power, rather than &s;uffer that Law to be broken. And tho our Succe&s;s under his Conduct was great and admirable; yet &s;oon af|ter his death, with the expence of much Blood and Trea&s;ure, we lo&s;t all that we had on that &s;ide, and &s;uffer'd the Penalty of having unadvi&s;edly enter'd into that Quarrel. By virtue of the &s;ame Law, the Agreement made by King <HI>John</HI> when he was Pri&s;oner at <HI>London,</HI> by which he had alie|nated part of that Dominion, as well as that of <HI>Francis</HI> the fir&s;t, conclud|ed when he was under the &s;ame Circum&s;tances at <HI>Madrid,</HI> were reputed null; and upon all occa&s;ions that Nation has given &s;ufficient te&s;timony, that the Laws by which they live are their own, made by them&s;elves, and not impos'd upon them. And 'tis as impo&s;&s;ible for them who made and depos'd Kings, exalted or depre&s;t reigning Familys, and pre&s;crib'd Rules to the Succe&s;&s;ion, to have receiv'd from their own Creatures the Power, or part of the Government they had, as for a man to be begotten by his own Son. Nay, tho their Con&s;titution was much chang'd by <HI>Lewis</HI> the 11<HI>th,</HI> yet they retain'd &s;o much of their antient Liberty, that in the la&s;t Age, when the Hou&s;e of <HI>Valois</HI> was as much deprav'd as tho&s;e of <HI>Meroveus</HI> and <HI>Pepin</HI> had bin, and <HI>Henry</HI> the third by his own Leud|ne&s;s, Hypocri&s;y, Cruelty and Impurity, together with the ba&s;ene&s;s of his Minions and Favorites, had render'd him&s;elf odious and contemptible to the Nobility and People; the great Citys, Parliaments, the greater and (in political matters) the &s;ounder part of the Nation declar'd him to be fallen from the Crown, and pur&s;u'd him to the death, tho the blow was given by the hand of a ba&s;e and half-di&s;tracted Monk.</P>

<P>Whoever imputes the acknowledgment of this to Kingcraft, and &s;ays, that they who avow this when 'tis for their advantage, will deny it on a

  different occa&s;ion, is of all men their mo&s;t dangerous Enemy. In laying &s;uch fraud to their charge, he de&s;troys the veneration by which they &s;ub|&s;i&s;t, and teaches Subjects not to keep Faith with tho&s;e, who by the mo&s;t malicious deceits &s;how, that they are ty'd by none. Human Societys are maintain'd by mutual Contracts, which are of no value if they are not ob&s;erv'd. Laws are made, and Magi&s;trats created to cau&s;e them to be perform'd in publick and private matters, and to puni&s;h tho&s;e who vio|late them. But none will ever be ob&s;erv'd, if he who receives the greate&s;t benefit by them, and is &s;et up to over&s;ee others, give the example <NOTE PLACE="marg">Suarum legum lator &amp; ever|&s;or. <HI>Tacit.</HI></NOTE>to tho&s;e who of them&s;elves are too much inclin'd to break them. The fir&s;t &s;tep that <HI>Pompey</HI> made to his own ruin was, by violating the Laws he him&s;elf had propos'd. But it would be much wor&s;e for Kings to break tho&s;e that are e&s;tabli&s;h'd by the Authority of a whole People, and con|firm'd by the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of many Ages.</P>
<P>I am far from laying any &s;uch blemi&s;hes on them, or thinking that they de&s;erve them. I mu&s;t believe the <HI>French</HI> King &s;peaks &s;incerely, when he &s;ays he can do nothing again&s;t the Laws of his Country: And that our King <HI>James</HI> did the like, when he acknowledg'd him&s;elf to be the Ser|vant of the Commonwealth; and the rather, becau&s;e 'tis true, and that he is plac'd in the Throne to that end. Nothing is more e&s;&s;ential and fundamental in the Con&s;titutions of Kingdoms, than that Diets, Parlia|ments, and A&s;&s;emblys of E&s;tates &s;hould &s;ee this perform'd. 'Tis not the King that gives them a right to judg of matters of War or Peace, to grant Supplys of men and mony, or to deny them; and to make or abrogate Laws at their plea&s;ure: All the Powers rightly belonging to Kings, or to them, proceed from the &s;ame root. The Northern Nations &s;eeing what mi&s;chiefs were generally brought upon the Ea&s;tern, by refer|ring too much to the irregular will of a man; and what tho&s;e who were more generous had &s;uffer'd, when one man by the force of a corrupt mercenary Soldiery had overthrown the Laws by which they liv'd, fear'd they might fall into the &s;ame mi&s;ery; and therefore retain'd the greater part of the Power to be exercis'd by their General A&s;&s;emblys, or by Delegates, when they grew &s;o numerous that they could not meet. The&s;e are the Kingdoms of which <HI>Grotius</HI> &s;peaks, <HI>where the King has his part, and the Senat or People their part of the &s;upreme Authority;</HI> and where the Law pre&s;cribes &s;uch limits, <HI>that if the King attempts to &s;eize that part which is not his, he may ju&s;tly be oppos'd:</HI> Which is as much as to &s;ay, that the Law upholds the Power it gives, and turns again&s;t tho&s;e who abu&s;e it.</P>
<P>This Doctrin may be di&s;plea&s;ing to Court-Para&s;ites; but is no le&s;s pro|fitable to &s;uch Kings as follow better Coun&s;els, than to the Nations that live under them: the Wi&s;dom and Vertue of the be&s;t is always fortify'd by the concurrence of tho&s;e who are plac'd in part of the Power; they always do what they will, when they will nothing but that which is good; and 'tis a happy impotence in tho&s;e, who thro ignorance or malice de&s;ire to do evil, not to be able to effect it. The weakne&s;s of &s;uch as by defects of Nature, Sex, Age, or Education, are not able of them&s;elves to bear the weight of a Kingdom, is thereby &s;upported, and they together with the People under them pre&s;erv'd from ruin; the furi|ous ra&s;hne&s;s of the In&s;olent is re&s;train'd; the extravagance of tho&s;e who are naturally leud, is aw'd; and the be&s;tial madne&s;s of the mo&s;t violent|ly wicked and outrageous, &s;uppre&s;t. When the Law provides for the&s;e matters, and pre&s;cribes ways by which they may be accompli&s;h'd, every
<PB N="215" REF="219">
man who receives or fears any Injury, &s;eeks a remedy in a legal way,   and vents his Pa&s;&s;ions in &s;uch a manner as brings no prejudice to the Commonwealth: If his Complaints again&s;t a King may be heard, and redre&s;t by Courts of Ju&s;tice, Parliaments, and Diets, as well as again&s;t private men, he is &s;atisfy'd, and looks no farther for a Remedy. But if Kings, like tho&s;e of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> will neither judg nor be judg'd, and there be no Power orderly to redre&s;s private or publick Injurys, every man has re|cour&s;e to force, as if he liv'd in a Wood where there is no Law; and that force is generally mortal to tho&s;e who provoke it: No Guards can pre&s;erve a hated Prince from the vengeance of one re&s;olute hand; and they as often fall by the Swords of their own Guards as of others: Wrongs will be done, and when they that do them cannot or will not be judg'd publickly, the injur'd Per&s;ons become Judges in their own ca&s;e, and Exe|cutioners of their own &s;entence. If this be dangerous in matters of pri|vate concernment, 'tis much more &s;o in tho&s;e relating to the publick. The leud extravagances of <HI>Edward</HI> and <HI>Richard</HI> the Seconds, whil&s;t they acknowledg'd the power of the Law, were gently reprov'd and re|&s;train'd with the removal of &s;ome profligate Favorites; but when they would admit of no other Law than their own Will, no relief could be had but by their Depo&s;ition. The lawful <HI>Spartan</HI> Kings, who were obe|dient to the Laws of their Country, liv'd in &s;afety, and dy'd with glory; whereas 'tis a &s;trange thing to &s;ee a lawle&s;s Tyrant die without &s;uch in|famy and mi&s;ery, as held a ju&s;t proportion with the wickedne&s;s of his Life. They did, as <HI>Plutarch</HI> &s;ays of <HI>Diony&s;ius, many mi&s;chiefs, and &s;uf|fer'd</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Vit. Timoleon&punc;</NOTE><HI>more.</HI> This is confirm'd by the examples of the Kingdom of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and of the Empires of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Greece;</HI> they who would &s;ubmit to no Law, were de&s;troy'd without any. I know not whether they thought them&s;elves to be Gods, as our Author &s;ays they were; but I am &s;ure the mo&s;t part of them dy'd like Dogs, and had the burial of A&s;&s;es rather than of Men.</P>
<P>This is the happine&s;s to which our Author would promote them all. <HI>If a King admits a People to be his companions, he cea&s;es to be a King, and the State becomes a Democracy.</HI> And a little farther: <HI>If in &s;uch A&s;&s;emblys, the King, Nobility, and People, have equal &s;hares in the Sovereignty, then the King has but one voice, the Nobility likewi&s;e one, and the People one; and then any two of the&s;e voices &s;hould have power to overrule the third: Thus the Nobility and Commons &s;hould have a power to make a Law to bridle the King, which was never &s;een in any Kingdom.</HI> We have heard of Nations that admitted a man to reign over them (that is, made him King) but of no man that made a People. The <HI>Hebrews</HI> made <HI>Saul, David, Jeroboam,</HI> and other Kings: when they return'd from Captivity, they confer'd the &s;ame Title upon the <HI>A&s;monean</HI> race, as a reward of their Valor and Ver|tue. The <HI>Romans</HI> cho&s;e <HI>Romulus, Numa, Ho&s;tilius,</HI> and others to be their Kings; the <HI>Spartans</HI> in&s;tituted two, one of the <HI>Heraclidae,</HI> the other of the <HI>Aeacid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e.</HI> Other Nations &s;et up one, a few, or more Magi&s;trats to govern them: and all the World agrees, that <HI>Qui dat e&s;&s;e, dat modum e&s;&s;e;</HI> He that makes him to be, makes him to be what is: and nothing can be more ab&s;urd than to &s;ay, that he who has nothing but what is given, can have more than is given to him. If <HI>Saul</HI> and <HI>Romulus</HI> had no other title to be Kings, than what the People confer'd upon them, they could be no otherwi&s;e Kings than as pleas'd the People: They therefore did not admit the People to be partakers of the Government; but the People who had all in them&s;elves, and could not have made a King if
<PB N="216" REF="220">
  they had not had it, be&s;tow'd upon him what they thought fit, and re|tain'd the re&s;t in them&s;elves. If this were not &s;o, then in&s;tead of &s;aying to the multitude, <HI>Will ye have this man to reign?</HI> they ought to &s;ay to the man, <HI>Wilt thou have this multitude to be a People?</HI> And whereas the No|bles of <HI>Arragon</HI> us'd to &s;ay to their new made King, <HI>We who are as good as you, make you our King, on condition you keep and maintain our Rights and Libertys, and if not, not;</HI> he &s;hould have &s;aid to them, I who am better than you, make you to be a People, and will govern you as I plea&s;e. But I doubt whether he would have &s;ucceeded, till that Kingdom was join'd to others of far greater &s;trength, from whence a power might be drawn to force them out of their u&s;ual method.</P>
<P>That which has bin &s;aid of the Governments of <HI>England, France,</HI> and o|ther Countrys, &s;hows them to be of the &s;ame nature; and if they de&s;erve not the name of Kingdoms, and that their Princes will by our Author's Arguments be per&s;uaded to leave them, tho&s;e Nations perhaps will be &s;o humble to content them&s;elves without that magnificent Title, rather than re&s;ign their own Libertys to purcha&s;e it: and if this will not plea&s;e him, he may &s;eek his glorious &s;overeign Monarchy among the wild <HI>Arabs,</HI> or in the I&s;land of <HI>Ceylon;</HI> for it will not be found among civiliz'd Nations.</P>
<P>However more ignorance cannot be expre&s;t, than by giving the name of <HI>Democracy</HI> to tho&s;e Governments that are compos'd of the three &s;imple &s;pecies, as we have prov'd that all the good ones have ever bin: for in a &s;trict &s;en&s;e it can only &s;ute with tho&s;e, where the People retain to them|&s;elves the admini&s;tration of the &s;upreme Power; and more largely, when the popular part, as in <HI>Athens,</HI> greatly overbalances the other two, and that the denomination is taken from the prevailing part. But our Author, if I mi&s;take not, is the fir&s;t that ever took the antient Governments of <HI>I&s;rael, Sparta</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> or tho&s;e of <HI>England, France, Germany</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> to be <HI>Democracys,</HI> only becau&s;e every one of them had Senats and A&s;&s;em|blys of the People, who in their Per&s;ons, or by their Deputys, did join with their chief Magi&s;trats in the exerci&s;e of the &s;upreme Power. That of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> to the time of <HI>Saul,</HI> is call'd by <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> an <HI>Ari&s;tocracy.</HI> The &s;ame name is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ven to that of <HI>Sparta</HI> by all the <HI>Greek</HI> Authors; and the great conte&s;t in the <HI>Peloponne&s;ian</HI> War was between the two kinds of Go|vernment; the Citys that were govern'd Ari&s;tocratically, or de&s;ir'd to be &s;o, following the <HI>Lacedemonians,</HI> and &s;uch as delighted in <HI>Democracy,</HI> taking part with the <HI>Athenians.</HI> In like manner <HI>Rome, England,</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> were &s;aid to be under Monarchys; not that their Kings might do what they pleas'd, but becau&s;e one man had a preheminence above any other. Yet if the <HI>Romans</HI> could take <HI>Romulus,</HI> the Son of a man that was never known, <HI>Numa</HI> a <HI>Sabin, Ho&s;tilius</HI> and <HI>Ancus Martius</HI> pri|vate men, and <HI>Tarquinius Pri&s;cus</HI> the Son of a bani&s;h'd <HI>Corinthian,</HI> who had no Title to a preference before others till it was be&s;tow'd upon them; 'tis ridiculous to think, that they who gave them what they had, could not &s;et what limits they pleas'd to their own gift.</P>
<P>But, &s;ays our Author, <HI>The Nobility will then have one Voice, and the Peo|ple another, and they joining may overrule the third, which was never &s;een in any Kingdom.</HI> This may perhaps be one way of regulating the Monar|chical Power, but it is not nece&s;&s;ary, nor the only one: There may be a Senate, tho the People be excluded; that Senate may be compos'd of men cho&s;en for their Vertue, as well as for the Nobility of their Birth: The Government may con&s;i&s;t of King and People without a Senate; or the
<PB N="217" REF="221">
Senate may be compos'd only of the Peoples Delegates. But if I &s;hould   grant his a&s;&s;ertion to be true, the rea&s;onablene&s;s of &s;uch a Con&s;titution cannot be de&s;troy'd by the con&s;equences he endeavors to draw from it; for he who would in&s;truct the world in matters of State, mu&s;t &s;how what is, or ought to be, not what he fancys may thereupon en&s;ue. Be&s;ides, it dos not follow, that where there are three equal Votes, Laws &s;hould be always made by the plurality; for the con&s;ent of all the three is in many places requir'd: and 'tis certain that in <HI>England,</HI> and other parts, the King and one of the E&s;tates cannot make a Law without the concur|rence of the other. But to plea&s;e <HI>Filmer,</HI> I will avow, that where the Nobles and Commons have an equal Vote, they may join and over-rule or limit the power of the King: and I leave any rea&s;onable man to judg, whether it be more &s;afe and fit, that tho&s;e two E&s;tates comprehending the whole body of the Nation in their Per&s;ons, or by repre&s;entation, &s;hould have a right to over-rule or limit the power of that man, woman, or child, who &s;its in the Throne; or that he or &s;he, young or old, wi&s;e or fooli&s;h, good or bad, &s;hould over rule them, and by their vices, weakne&s;s, folly, impertinence, incapacity, or malice, put a &s;top to their proceedings; and whether the chief concernments of a Nation may more &s;afely and prudently be made to depend upon the votes of &s;o many emi|nent Per&s;ons, among&s;t whom many wi&s;e and good men will always be found if there be any in the Nation, and who in all re&s;pects have the &s;ame intere&s;t with them, or upon the will of one, who may be, and often is as vile, ignorant, and wretched as the meane&s;t Slave; and either has, or is for the mo&s;t part made to believe he has, an intere&s;t &s;o contrary to them, that their &s;uppre&s;&s;ion is his Advancement. Common &s;en&s;e &s;o naturally leads us to the deci&s;ion of this Que&s;tion, that I &s;hould not think it po&s;&s;ible for Mankind to have mi&s;taken, tho we had no examples of it in Hi&s;tory: and 'tis in vain to &s;ay, that all Princes are not &s;uch as I repre|&s;ent; for if a right were annex'd to the being of a Prince, and that his &s;ingle judgment &s;hould over-balance that of a whole Nation, it mu&s;t be|long to him as a Prince, and be enjoy'd by the wor&s;t and ba&s;e&s;t, as well as by the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t, which would inevitably draw on the ab&s;urditys above mention'd. But that many are, and have bin &s;uch, no man can deny, or rea&s;onably hope that they will not often prove to be &s;uch, as long as any preference is granted to tho&s;e who have nothing to recom|mend them, but the Familys from whence they derive; a continual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e who excel in Vertue, Wi&s;dom, and Experience, being promis'd to none, nor rea&s;onably to be expected from any. Such a Right therefore cannot be claim'd by all; and if not by all, then not by any, unle&s;s it proceed from a particular grant in con&s;ideration of per&s;onal Vertue, Ability, and Integrity, which mu&s;t be prov'd: and when any one goes about to do it, I will either acknowledg him to be in the right, or give the rea&s;ons of my denial.</P>
<P>However this is nothing to the general Propo&s;ition: nay, if a man were to be found, who had more of the qualitys requir'd for making a right judgment in matters of the greate&s;t importance, than a whole Nation, or an A&s;&s;embly of the be&s;t men cho&s;en out of it (which I never heard to have bin, unle&s;s in the Per&s;ons of <HI>Mo&s;es, Jo&s;hua,</HI> or <HI>Samuel,</HI> who had the Spirit of God for their guide) it would be nothing to our purpo&s;e; for even he might be bia&s;s'd by his per&s;onal Intere&s;ts, which Governments are not e&s;tabli&s;h'd to promote.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="222">
  I may go a &s;tep farther, and truly &s;ay, that as &s;uch va&s;t Powers cannot be generally granted to all who happen to &s;ucceed in any Familys without evident danger of utter De&s;truction, when they come to be executed by children, women, fools, vicious, incapable or wicked per&s;ons, they can be rea&s;onably granted to none, becau&s;e no man knows what any one will prove till he be try'd; and the importance of the Affair requires &s;uch a trial as can be made of no man till he be dead. He that re&s;i&s;ts one Temptation may fall under the Power of another; and nothing is more common in the world, than to &s;ee tho&s;e men fail gro&s;ly in the la&s;t actions of their lives, who had pa&s;s'd their former days without reproach: Wi&s;e and good men will with <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;ay of them&s;elves, <HI>I cannot bear the burden;</HI> and every man who is concern'd for the publick Good, ought to let fools know they are not fit to undergo it, and by Law to re&s;train the fury of &s;uch as will not be guided by rea&s;on. This could not be deny'd, tho Governments were con&s;tituted for the good of the Governor. 'Tis good for him that the Law appoints helps for his Infirmitys, and re&s;trains his Vices: but all Nations ought to do it tho it were not &s;o, in as much as Kingdoms are not e&s;tabli&s;h'd for the good of one man, but of the People; and that King who &s;eeks his own good before that of the People, departs from the end of his In&s;titution.</P>
<P>This is &s;o plain, that all Nations who have acted freely, have &s;ome way or other endeavour'd to &s;upply the defects, or re&s;train the vices of their &s;upreme Magi&s;trats; and tho&s;e among them de&s;erve mo&s;t prai&s;e, who by appointing means adequate to &s;o great a work, have taken care that it might be ea&s;ily and &s;afely accompli&s;h'd: Such Nations have always flouri&s;h'd in Vertue, Power, Glory, and Happine&s;s, whil&s;t tho&s;e who wanted their Wi&s;dom, have &s;uffer'd all manner of Calamitys by the weakne&s;s or inju&s;tice of their Princes, or have had their hands perpetual|ly in Blood to pre&s;erve them&s;elves from their fury. We need no better example of the fir&s;t, than that of the <HI>Spartans,</HI> who by appointing &s;uch Limits to the power of their Kings as could hardly be tran&s;gre&s;t, conti|nu'd many Ages in great union with them, and were never troubled with civil Tumults. The like may be &s;aid of the <HI>Romans</HI> from the expul&s;ion of the <HI>Tarquins,</HI> till they overthrew their own Orders, by continuing <HI>Marius</HI> for five years in the Con&s;ulat, whereas the Laws did not permit a man to hold the &s;ame Office two years together; and when that rule was broken, their own Magi&s;trats grew too &s;trong for them, and &s;ubver|ted the Commonwealth. When this was done, and the power came into the hands of one man, all manner of evils and calamitys broke in like a flood: 'Tis hard to judg, whether the mi&s;chiefs he did, or tho&s;e he &s;uffer'd were the greater. He who &s;et up him&s;elf to be Lord of the World, was like to a Bea&s;t crown'd for the &s;laughter, and his greatne&s;s was the forerunner of his ruin. By this means &s;ome of tho&s;e who &s;eem not to have bin naturally prone to evil, were by their fears put upon &s;uch cour&s;es to pre&s;erve them&s;elves, as being rightly e&s;timated, were wor&s;e than the death they apprehended: and the &s;o much celebrated <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great dy'd no le&s;s polluted with the Blood of his neare&s;t Relations and Friends, than <HI>Nero</HI> him&s;elf. But no place can &s;how a more lively <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE>picture of this, than the Kingdoms of <HI>Granada,</HI> and others po&s;&s;e&s;t by the <HI>Moors</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> where there being neither Senate nor A&s;&s;emblys of the Nobility and People, to re&s;train the violence and fury of their Kings, they had no other way than to kill them when their vices became in&s;up|portable; which happening for the mo&s;t part, they were almo&s;t all mur|der'd;
<PB N="219" REF="223">
and things were brought to &s;uch extremity, that no man would   accept a Crown, except he who had neither Birth nor Vertue to de|&s;erve it.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid that Kings have now found out more ea&s;y ways of doing what they plea&s;e, and &s;ecuring them&s;elves; I an&s;wer, that they have not prov'd &s;o to all, and it is not yet time for &s;uch as tread in the &s;ame &s;teps to boa&s;t of their &s;ucce&s;s: many have fallen when they thought their de&s;igns accompli&s;h'd; and no man, as long as he lives, can rea&s;onably a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf the like &s;hall not befal him. But if in this corrupted Age, the treachery and perjury of Princes be more common than formerly; and the number of tho&s;e who are brought to delight in the rewards of inju&s;tice, be &s;o increas'd, that their partys are &s;tronger than formerly: this rather &s;hows that the balance of Power is broken, or hard to be kept up, than that there ought to be none; and 'tis difficult for any man, without the Spirit of Prophecy, to tell what this will produce. Whil&s;t the antient Con&s;titutions of our Northern Kingdoms remain'd intire, &s;uch as conte&s;ted with their Princes, &s;ought only to reform the Governments, and by re|dre&s;&s;ing what was ami&s;s, to reduce them to their fir&s;t Principles; but they may not perhaps be &s;o mode&s;t, when they &s;ee the very nature of their Government chang'd, and the foundations overthrown. I am not &s;ure that they who were well pleas'd with a moderate Monarchy, will &s;ubmit to one that is ab&s;olute; and 'tis not improbable, that when men &s;ee there is no medium between Tyranny and Popularity, they who would have bin contented with the reformation of their Government, may proceed farther, and have recour&s;e to Force, when there is no help in the Law. This will be a hard work in tho&s;e places where Vertue is wholly aboli&s;h'd; but the difficulty will lie on the other &s;ide, if any &s;parks of that remain: if Vice and Corruption prevail, Liberty cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t; but if Vertue has the advantage, arbitrary Power cannot be e&s;tabli&s;h'd. Tho&s;e who boa&s;t of their <HI>Loyalty,</HI> and think they give te&s;timonys of it, when they addict them&s;elves to the will of one Man, tho contrary to the Law from whence that Quality is deriv'd, may con&s;ider, that by putting their Ma&s;ters upon illegal cour&s;es, they certainly make them the wor&s;t of men, and bring them into danger of being al&s;o the mo&s;t mi&s;erable. Few or no good Princes have fallen into di&s;a&s;ters, unle&s;s thro an extremity of corrup|tion introduc'd by the mo&s;t wicked; and cannot properly be call'd unhap|py, if they peri&s;h'd in their Innocence; &s;ince the bitterne&s;s of Death is a&s;&s;uag'd by the tears of a loving People, the a&s;&s;urance of a glorious me|mory, and the quiet of a well-&s;atisfy'd mind. But of tho&s;e who have abandon'd them&s;elves to all manner of Vice, follow'd the impul&s;e of their own fury, and &s;et them&s;elves to de&s;troy the be&s;t men for oppo&s;ing their pernicious de&s;igns, very few have dy'd in peace. Their Lives have bin mi&s;erable, Death infamous, and Memory dete&s;table.</P>
<P>They therefore who place Kings within the power of the Law, and the Law to be a guide to Kings, equally provide for the good of King and People: Whereas they who admit of no participants in power, and ac|knowledg no rule but their own Will, &s;et up an intere&s;t in them&s;elves again&s;t that of their People, lo&s;e their affections, which is their mo&s;t im|portant Trea&s;ure, and incur their hatred, from whence re&s;ults their greate&s;t danger.</P>

<HEAD>  SECT. XXXI. The Libertys of Nations are from God and Nature, not from Kings.</HEAD>
<P>WHat&s;oever is u&s;ually &s;aid in oppo&s;ition to this, &s;eems to proceed from a groundle&s;s conceit, that the Libertys enjoy'd by Nations ari&s;e from the Conce&s;&s;ions of Princes. This point has bin already treated: but being the foundation of the Doctrin I oppo&s;e, it may not be ami&s;s far|ther to examin how it can be po&s;&s;ible for one man, born under the &s;ame condition with the re&s;t of Mankind, to have a Right in him&s;elf that is not common to all others, till it be by them or a certain number of them confer'd upon him; or how he can without the utmo&s;t ab&s;urdity be &s;aid to grant Libertys and Privileges to them who made him to be what he is.</P>
<P>If I had to do with a man that &s;ought after Truth, I &s;hould think he had bin led into this extravagant opinion by the terms ordinarily us'd in Patents and Charters granted to particular men; and not di&s;tingui&s;hing between the Proprietor and the Di&s;pen&s;er, might think Kings had given, as their own, that which they only di&s;tribute out of the publick Trea&s;ury, and could have had nothing to di&s;tribute by parcels, if it had not bin given to them in gro&s;s by the Publick. But I need not u&s;e our Author &s;o gently. The perver&s;ity of his judgment, and ob&s;tinate hatred to Truth, is &s;ufficient to draw him into the mo&s;t ab&s;urd errors, without any other inducement; and it were not charity, but folly to think otherwi&s;e of one who attributes in general to all Princes, without any regard to the ways by which they attain to their Power, &s;uch an Authority as never ju&s;tly belong'd to any.</P>
<P>This will be evident to all tho&s;e who con&s;ider, that no man can confer upon others that which he has not in him&s;elf: If he be originally no more than they, he cannot grant to them or any of them more than they to him. In the 7<HI>th,</HI> 8<HI>th,</HI> 9<HI>th,</HI> and &s;ub&s;equent Sections of the fir&s;t Chapter, it has bin prov'd that there is no re&s;emblance between the paternal Right, and the ab&s;olute Power which he a&s;&s;erts in Kings: that the right of a Father, whatever it be, is only over his Children; that this right is equally inherited by them all when he dies: that every one cannot in|herit Dominion; for the right of one would be incon&s;i&s;tent with that of all others: that the right which is common to all is that which we call Li|berty, or exemption from Dominion: that the fir&s;t Fathers of Mankind after the Flood had not the exerci&s;e of Regal Power; and what&s;oever they had was equally devolv'd to every one of their Sons, as appears by the examples of <HI>Noah, Shem, Abraham, I&s;aac, Jacob,</HI> and their Children: that the erection of <HI>Nimrod</HI>'s Kingdom was directly contrary to, and in|con&s;i&s;tent with the paternal right, if there was any regality in it: that the other Kingdoms of that time were of the &s;ame nature: that <HI>Nimrod</HI> not exceeding the age of three&s;core years when he built <HI>Babel,</HI> could not be the Father of tho&s;e that a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in that attempt: that if the &s;eventy two Kings, who, as our Author &s;ays, went from <HI>Babylon</HI> upon the con|&s;u&s;ion of Languages, were not the Sons of <HI>Nimrod,</HI> he could not govern them by the right of a Father; if they were, they mu&s;t have bin very voung, and could not have Children of their own to people the Kingdoms they &s;et up: that who&s;e Children &s;oever they were, who out of a part of
<PB N="221" REF="225">
Mankind did within a hundred and thirty two years after the Flood, di|vide   into &s;o many Kingdoms, they &s;hew'd that others in proce&s;s of time might &s;ubdivide into as many as they pleas'd; and Kingdoms multiply|ing in the &s;pace of four thou&s;and years &s;ince the 72, in the &s;ame proporti|on they did in one hundred and thirty two years into &s;eventy two, there would now be as many Kings in the World as there are men; that is, no man could be &s;ubject to another: that this equality of Right and exemption from the domination of any other, is call'd Liberty: that he who enjoys it cannot be depriv'd of it, unle&s;s by his own con&s;ent, or by force: that no one man can force a Multitude, or if he did, it could con|fer no right upon him: that a Multitude con&s;enting to be govern'd by one man, dos confer upon him the power of governing them; the pow|ers therefore that he has, are from them, and they who have all in them&s;elves can receive nothing from him, who has no more than every one of them, till they do inve&s;t him with it. This is prov'd by &s;acred and profane Hi&s;torys. The <HI>Hebrews</HI> in the creation of Judges, Kings, or other Magi&s;trats, had no regard to Paternity, or to any who by ex|traction could in the lea&s;t pretend to the right of Fathers: God did never direct them to do it, nor reprove them for neglecting it: If they would chu&s;e a King, he commanded them to take one of their Brethren, not one who call'd him&s;elf their Father: When they did re&s;olve to have one, he commanded them to chu&s;e him by lot, and caus'd the Lot to fall upon a young man of the younge&s;t Tribe: <HI>David</HI> and the other Kings of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> or <HI>Judah</HI> had no more to &s;ay for them&s;elves in that point than <HI>Saul:</HI> All the Kings of that Nation before and after the Captivity, ordinarily or extra|ordinarily &s;et up, ju&s;tly or unju&s;tly, were rais'd without regard to any Pre|rogative they could claim or arrogate to them&s;elves on that account. All that they had therefore was from their elevation, and their elevation from tho&s;e that elevated them: 'Twas impo&s;&s;ible for them to confer any thing upon tho&s;e from whom they receiv'd all they had; or for the People to give power to Kings, if they had not had it in them&s;elves; which Power univer&s;ally re&s;iding in every one, is that which we call Liberty. The method of other Nations was much like to this. They plac'd tho&s;e in the Throne who &s;eem'd be&s;t to de&s;erve &s;o great an Honour, and mo&s;t able to bear &s;o great a Burden: The Kingdoms of the Heroes were nothing el&s;e but the Government of tho&s;e who were mo&s;t beneficent to the Nations among&s;t whom they liv'd, and who&s;e Vertues were thought fit to be rais'd above the ordinary level of the World. Tho perhaps there was not any one <HI>Athenian</HI> or <HI>Roman</HI> equal to <HI>The&s;eus</HI> or <HI>Romulus</HI> in courage and &s;trength, yet they were not able to &s;ubdue many: or if any man &s;hould be &s;o vain to think that each of them did at fir&s;t &s;ubdue one man, then two, and &s;o proceeding by degrees conquer'd a whole People, he cannot without madne&s;s a&s;cribe the &s;ame to <HI>Numa,</HI> who being &s;ent for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rom a &s;oreign Country, was immediately made King of a fierce People, that had already conquer'd many of their Neighbours, and was grown too boi&s;terous even for <HI>Romulus</HI> him&s;elf. The like may be &s;aid of the fir&s;t <HI>Tarquin,</HI> and of <HI>Servius;</HI> they were Strangers: and tho <HI>Tullus Ho&s;tilius</HI> and <HI>Ancus Martius</HI> were <HI>Romans,</HI> they had as little title to a Dominion over their Fellow-Citizens, or means of attaining to it, as if they had come &s;rom the farthe&s;t parts of the Earth. This mu&s;t be in all places, unle&s;s one man could prove by a perfect and uninterrupted Genealogy, that he is the elde&s;t Son of the elde&s;t Line of <HI>Noah,</HI> and that Line to have
<PB N="222" REF="226">
  continu'd perpetually in the Government of the World: for if the Power has bin divided, it may be &s;ubdivided to infinity; if interrupted, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e chain is broken, and can never be made whole. But if our Author can perform this for the &s;ervice of any man, I willingly &s;urrender my Arms, and yield up the Cau&s;e I defend. If he fail, 'tis ridiculous to pretend a Right that belongs to no man, or to go about to retrieve a Right which for the &s;pace of four thou&s;and years has lain dormant; and much more to create that which never had a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. This leads us nece&s;&s;arily to a conclu&s;ion, That all Kingdoms are at the fir&s;t erected by the con&s;ent of Nations, and given to whom they plea&s;e; or el&s;e all are &s;et up by force, or &s;ome by force, and &s;ome by con&s;ent: If any are &s;et up by the con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ent of Nations, their Kings do not confer Libertys upon tho&s;e Nations, but re|ceive all from them, and the general Propo&s;ition is fal&s;e. If our Author therefore, or his Followers, would confute me, they mu&s;t prove that all the Kingdoms of the World have their beginning from force, and that Force dos always create a Right; or if they recede from the general Pro|po&s;ition, and attribute a peculiar right to one or more Princes, who are &s;o ab&s;olute Lords of their People, that tho&s;e under them have neither Li|berty, Privilege, Property or Part in the Government, but by their Con|ce&s;&s;ions, they mu&s;t prove that tho&s;e Princes did by force gain the Power they have, and that their Right is deriv'd from it. This Force al&s;o mu&s;t have bin perpetually continu'd; for if that force be the root of the Right that is pretended, another force by the &s;ame rule may overturn, extingui&s;h or transfer it to another hand. If Contracts have interven'd, the force cea&s;es; and the Right that afterwards dos accrue to the per&s;ons, mu&s;t proceed from, and be regulated according to tho&s;e Contracts.</P>
<P>This may be &s;ufficient to my purpo&s;e: For having already prov'd, that the Kingdoms of <HI>I&s;rael, Judah, Rome, Sparta, France, Spain, England,</HI> and all that we are concern'd in, or that de&s;erve to be examples to us, did ari&s;e from the con&s;ent of the re&s;pective Nations, and were frequently re|duc'd to their fir&s;t Principles, when the Princes have endeavour'd to tran&s;gre&s;s the Laws of their In&s;titution; it could be nothing to us, tho <HI>Attila</HI> or <HI>Tamerlan</HI> had by force gain'd the Dominions they po&s;&s;e&s;t. But I dare go a &s;tep further, and boldly a&s;&s;ert, that there never was or can be a man in the world that did, or can &s;ubdue a Nation; and that the right of one grounded upon force, is a mere whim&s;y. It was not <HI>Agathocles, Diony&s;ius, Nabis, Marius, Sylla</HI> or <HI>Ce&s;ar,</HI> but the mercenary Soldiers, and other Villains that join'd with them, who &s;ubdu'd the <HI>Syracu&s;ans, Spar|tans,</HI> or <HI>Romans:</HI> And as the work was not perform'd by tho&s;e Tyrants alone, if a right had bin gain'd by the violence they us'd, it mu&s;t have bin common to all tho&s;e that gain'd it; and he that commanded them could have had no more than they thought fit to con&s;er upon him. When <NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. in V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t.

<PB N="223" REF="227">
the impul&s;e of a be&s;tial rage, and aiming at nothing but the &s;atisfacti|on   of their own lu&s;ts, always advance one from whom they expect the greate&s;t advantages to them&s;elves, and give him &s;uch Powers as mo&s;t con|duce to the accompli&s;hment of their own ends: but as to the Per&s;on 'tis the &s;ame thing. <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Nero</HI> did no more make them&s;elves what they were, than <HI>Numa;</HI> and could no more confer any Right, Liberty or Privilege upon the Army that gave them all they had, than the mo&s;t regu|lar Magi&s;trate could upon the Senat or People that cho&s;e him.</P>
<P>This al&s;o is common to the wor&s;t as well as the be&s;t, that they who &s;et up either, do, as into a publick Trea&s;ury, confer upon the Per&s;on they chu&s;e, a Power of di&s;tributing to particular men, or numbers of men, &s;uch Honors, Privileges and Advantages, as they may &s;eem, according to the Principles of the Government, to de&s;erve. But there is this diffe|rence, that the ends of the one being good, and tho&s;e of the other evil, the fir&s;t do for the mo&s;t part limit the Powers, that &s;omething may remain to reward Services done to the Publick, in a manner proportion'd to the merit of every one; placing other Magi&s;trats to &s;ee it really perform'd, &s;o as they may not, by the weakne&s;s or vices of the Governor, be turn'd to the publick detriment: the others think they never give enough, that the Prince having all in his Power, may be able to gratify their mo&s;t exor|bitant de&s;ires, if by any ways they can get his favour; and his infirmi|tys and vices being mo&s;t beneficial to them, they &s;eldom allow to any o|ther Magi&s;trate a power of oppo&s;ing his Will, or &s;uffer tho&s;e who for the publick good would a&s;&s;ume it. The World affords many examples of both &s;orts, and every one of them have had their progre&s;s &s;utable to their Con&s;titution. The regular Kingdoms of <HI>England, France, Spain, Po|land, Bohemia, Denmark, Sweden,</HI> and others, whether elective or here|ditary, have had High Stewards, Con&s;tables, Mayors of the Palace, Rixhofmei&s;ters, Parliaments, Diets, A&s;&s;emblys of E&s;tates, Cortez, and the like, by which tho&s;e have bin admitted to &s;ucceed who &s;eem'd mo&s;t fit for the publick Service; the unworthy have bin rejected; the infir|mitys of the weak &s;upply'd; the malice of the unju&s;t re&s;train'd; and when nece&s;&s;ity requir'd, the Crown transfer'd from one Line or Family to another. But in the furious Tyrannys that have bin &s;et up by the vio|lence of a corrupted Soldiery, as in the antient <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, the King|doms of the <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Arabians,</HI> the Tyrannys of <HI>Ezzelino</HI> of <HI>Padoa,</HI> tho&s;e of the <HI>Vi&s;conti</HI> and <HI>Sforze&s;chi</HI> of <HI>Milan, Ca&s;truccio Ca&s;traccani</HI> of <HI>Lucca, Ce&s;ar Borgia,</HI> and others, there was nothing of all this. The Will of the Prince was a Law; all Power was in him, and he kept it, till ano|ther &s;tept up and took it from him, by the &s;ame means that he had gain'd it. This fell out &s;o frequently, that tho all the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors endea|vour'd to make their Power hereditary, it hardly continu'd three Gene|rations in one Line from <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> to <HI>Augu&s;tulus,</HI> unle&s;s in that of <HI>Con&s;tan|tine,</HI> and that with extreme confu&s;ion and di&s;order. They who had madly &s;et up a Man to be their Head, and expos'd &s;o much of the World as was under their power, to be de&s;troy'd by him, did by the like fury throw him down, and never ceas'd till they had brought the Empire to utter ruin.</P>
<P>But if this paternal Sovereignty be a mere fiction that never had any effect; and no Nation was ever commanded by God to make it their rule, nor any reprov'd for the neglect of it; none ever learnt it from the light of nature, nor were by wi&s;e men taught to regard it: If the fir&s;t Fathers claim'd no Privilege from it when every man's Genealogy was
<PB N="224" REF="228">
  known; and tho there were &s;uch a thing in nature, it could be of no u&s;e at this day, when the &s;everal Races of men are &s;o confus'd, that not one in the world can prove his own Original: If the fir&s;t Kingdoms, whether well or ill con&s;tituted, according to the Command of God, or the Inventions of Men, were contrary to, and incompatible with it; and there can have bin no ju&s;tice in any, if &s;uch a Rule was to have bin ob&s;erv'd; the continuance of an unju&s;t u&s;urpation can never have created a Right, but aggravated the in|ju&s;tice of overthrowing it: If no man could ever by his own &s;trength and courage &s;ubdue a multitude, nor gain any other right over them, if he did, than they might have to tear it from him; Whoever denies King|doms or other Magi&s;tracys to have bin &s;et up by men, according to their own will, and from an opinion of receiving benefit by them, accu&s;es all the Governments that are, or ever have bin in the world, of that outra|geous inju&s;tice in their Foundation which can never be repair'd. If there be therefore, or ever was any ju&s;t Government among&s;t men, it was con&s;ti|tuted by them; and whether their Proceedings were regular or violent, ju&s;t or unju&s;t, the Powers annex'd to it were their Donation: The Magi&s;tracys erected by them, whether in one or more men, temporary or perpetual, elective or hereditary, were their Creatures; and receiving all from them, could confer nothing upon them.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXXII. The Contracts made between Magi&s;trats, and the Nations that created them, were real, &s;olemn, and obligatory.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author having with big words and little &s;en&s;e inveigh'd a|gain&s;t Popular and Mix'd Governments, proceeds as if he had prov'd that they could not, or ought not to be. <HI>If it be,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>unna|tural for the Multitude to chu&s;e their Governors, or to govern, or to par|take in the Government; what can be thought of that damnable Conclu&s;ion which is made by too many, that the Multitude may correct or depo&s;e their Princes, if need be? Surely the unnaturalne&s;s and inju&s;tice of this Po&s;ition cannot &s;ufficiently be expre&s;t. For admit that a King make a Contract or Paction with his People originally in his Ance&s;tors, or per&s;onally at his Coro|nation (for both the&s;e Pactions &s;ome dream of, but cannot offer any proof of either) yet by no Law of any Nation can a Contract be thought broken, except fir&s;t a lawful trial be had by the ordinary Judg of the breakers thereof; or el&s;e every man may be both Party and Judg in his own ca&s;e, which is ab&s;urd once to be thought: for then it will lie in the hands of the headle&s;s multitude, when they plea&s;e, to ca&s;t off the Yoke of Government that God has laid upon them, and to judg and puni&s;h him, by whom they &s;hould be judg'd and puni&s;h'd them|&s;elves.</HI> To this I an&s;wer fir&s;t briefly, That if it be natural for the Mul|titude to chu&s;e their Governors, or to govern, or to participate of the Government as be&s;t plea&s;es them&s;elves; or that there never was a Govern|ment in the World that was not &s;o &s;et up by them, in pur&s;uance of the Power naturally inherent in them&s;elves; what can be thought of that damnable Conclu&s;ion, which has bin made by Fools or Knaves, That the Multitude may not, if need be, correct or depo&s;e their own Magi&s;trats? Surely the unnaturalne&s;s and inju&s;tice of &s;uch a Po&s;ition cannot be &s;uffi|ciently expre&s;t. If that were admitted, all the mo&s;t &s;olemn Pacts and
<PB N="225" REF="229">
Contracts made between Nations and their Magi&s;trats, originally or per|&s;onally,   and confirm'd by Laws and mutual Oaths, would be of no value. He that would break the mo&s;t &s;acred Bonds that can be among&s;t men, &s;hould by perjury and wickedne&s;s become Judg of his own ca&s;e, and by the wor&s;t of crimes procure impunity for all. It would be in his power, by folly, wickedne&s;s and madne&s;s, to de&s;troy the Multitude which he was created and &s;worn to pre&s;erve, tho wi&s;e, vertuous and ju&s;t, and headed by the wi&s;e&s;t and ju&s;te&s;t of men; or to lay a Yoke upon tho&s;e who by the Laws of God and Nature ought to be free: He might in his own ca&s;e judg that Body by which he ought to be judg'd; and who in con&s;idera|tion of them&s;elves and their own good, made him to be what&s;oever he is more than every one of them: The Governments in&s;tituted for the pre|&s;ervation of Nations, would turn to their de&s;truction: It would be im|po&s;&s;ible to check the fury of a corrupt and perfidious Magi&s;trate: The wor&s;t of men would be rais'd to a height that was never de&s;erv'd by the be&s;t; and the a&s;&s;urance of indemnity would, by increa&s;ing their in&s;o|lence, turn their other vices into madne&s;s, as has bin too often &s;een in tho&s;e who have had more power than they de&s;erv'd, and were more hardly brought to account for their actions than ought to have bin; tho I never heard of any who had &s;o much as our Author a&s;&s;erts to be in all, nor that any was ab&s;olutely a&s;&s;ur'd he &s;hould not be que&s;tion'd for the abu&s;e of what he had.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, if every People may govern, or con&s;titute and chu&s;e one or more Governors, they may divide the Powers between &s;everal Men, or ranks of men, allotting to every one &s;o much as they plea&s;e, or retaining &s;o much as they think fit. This has bin prac|tis'd in all the Governments, which under &s;everal forms have flou|ri&s;h'd in <HI>Pale&s;tine, Greece, Italy, Germany, France, England,</HI> and the re&s;t of the World. The Laws of every place &s;how what the Power of the re&s;pective Magi&s;trate is, and by declaring how much is allow'd to him, declare what is deny'd; for he has not that which he has not, and is to be accounted a Magi&s;trate whil&s;t he exerci&s;es that which he has.</P>
<P>If any doubts do hereupon ari&s;e, I hope to remove them, proving in the fir&s;t place, that &s;everal Nations have plainly and explicitly made Con|tracts with their Magi&s;trats.</P>
<P>2. That they are implicit, and to be under&s;tood, where they are not plainly expre&s;t.</P>
<P>3. That they are not dreams, but real things, and perpetually obliging.</P>
<P>4. That Judges are in many places appointed to decide the Conte&s;ts ari&s;ing from the breach of the&s;e Contracts; and where they are not, or the party offending is of &s;uch force or pride that he will not &s;ubmit, Na|tions have bin oblig'd to take the extreme&s;t cour&s;es.</P>
<P>To the fir&s;t: I &s;uppo&s;e it will not be deny'd, that the annual Magi|&s;trats of divers Commonwealths are under &s;ome Compact, and that there is a power of con&s;training them to perform the contents, or to puni&s;h them for the violation. The mode&s;t behaviour of the <HI>Roman</HI> Con&s;uls and Dictators (as long as their Laws were in force) might not probably proceed from their good nature. Tho the people had not bin, as our Au|thor &s;ays, <HI>mad, fooli&s;h, and always de&s;irous to chu&s;e the wor&s;t men for being mo&s;t like to them&s;elves,</HI> but admirably wi&s;e and vertuous, 'tis not to be imagin'd that in the &s;pace of three or four hundred years they &s;hould never have fallen upon one who would have tran&s;gre&s;t, if he could have done it &s;afely, tho they had us'd the utmo&s;t caution in their choice.

<P>The Scripture is more clear in the ca&s;e. The Judges are &s;aid to have bin in power equal to Kings; and I may perhaps ackowledg it, with re|lation to the Deuteronomical King, or &s;uch as the People might have cho&s;en without offending God. The <HI>Gileadites</HI> made a Covenant with <HI>Jephtha,</HI> that he &s;hould be their Head and Captain: He would not return to his Country till they had done it. This was perform'd &s;olemnly be|fore the Lord in <HI>Mi&s;peth,</HI> and all <HI>I&s;rael</HI> follow'd them. They might therefore make a Covenant with their Kings, for the difference of name dos not increa&s;e or dimini&s;h the Right. Nay, they were in duty oblig'd to do it: The words of the 17<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Deuter. He &s;hall not multiply Wives, &amp;c. that his Heart be not lifted up above his Brethren,</HI> can have no other &s;igni|fication, than that they &s;hould take care he did it not, or, as <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays, hinder him if he attempt it; for the Law was not given to the King who was not, but tho&s;e who might make him if they thought fit. In pur&s;u|ance of this Law&mdash;</P>

<HEAD>SECT. I. Kings not being Fathers of their People, nor excelling all others in Ver|tue, can have no other ju&s;t Power than what the Laws give; nor any title to the privileges of the Lord's Anointed.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING prov'd that the right of Fathers is from Nature, and incommunicable, it mu&s;t follow, that every man dos per|petually owe all love, re&s;pect, &s;ervice, and obedience to him that did beget, nouri&s;h, and educate him, and to no other un|der that name. No man therefore can claim the right of a Father over any, except one that is &s;o; no man can &s;erve two Ma&s;ters; the extent and perpetuity of the Duty which every man owes to his Father, ren|ders it impo&s;&s;ible for him to owe the &s;ame to any other: This right of Father cannot be devolv'd to the Heir of the Father, otherwi&s;e than as every Son by the Law of Nature is Heir to his Father, and has the &s;ame right of commanding his Children, as his Father had of commanding him when he was a Child: no man can owe to his Brother that which he ow'd to his Father, becau&s;e he cannot receive that from him which he had from his Father: but the utmo&s;t of all ab&s;urditys that can enter into the Heart of man is, for one to exact the rights due to a Father, who has no other title than force and u&s;urpation, it being no le&s;s than to &s;ay, that I owe as much to one who has done me the greate&s;t of all Injurys, as to him who has confer'd upon me the greate&s;t Benefits: or, which is yet wor&s;e, if po&s;&s;ible, that as the&s;e u&s;urpations cannot be made but by rob|bing, &s;poiling, impri&s;oning, or killing the Per&s;on in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; that Duty, which by the eternal Law of Nature I owe to my Father, &s;hould oblige me to pay the &s;ame veneration, obedience, and &s;ervice, to the man that has &s;poil'd, impri&s;on'd, or kill'd my Father, as I ow'd to him; or that the &s;ame Law which oblig'd me to obey and defend my Father, be|cau&s;e he was &s;o, &s;hould oblige me to obey and defend his enemy, becau&s;e he has impri&s;on'd or kill'd him; and not only to pa&s;s over the Law of God, which makes me the avenger of my Father's Blood, but to re|ward his Murderer with the rights that comprehend all that is mo&s;t tender and &s;acred in Nature, and to look upon one that has done me the greate&s;t of all inju&s;tices and injurys, as upon him to whom I owe my Birth and Education. This being evident to all tho&s;e who have any mea&s;ure of common &s;en&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e it may be &s;afely concluded, that what right &s;oever a Father may have over his Family, it cannot relate to that which a King has over his People; unle&s;s he, like the man in the I&s;land of <HI>Pines,</HI> mention'd before, be al&s;o the Father of them all. That which is
<PB N="228" REF="232">
  ab&s;olutely unlike in manner and &s;ub&s;tance, in&s;titution and exerci&s;e, mu&s;t be unlike in all re&s;pects; and the Conclu&s;ions, which have their &s;trength from Similitude and Parity, can have none when there is not the lea&s;t &s;imilitude of either. And tho it were true, that Fathers are held by no contracts, (which generally 'tis not; for when the Son is of age, and dos &s;omething for the Father to which he is not oblig'd, or gives him that which he is not bound to give, &s;uppo&s;e an Inheritance receiv'd from a Friend, goods of his own acqui&s;ition, or that he be emancipated, all good Laws look upon tho&s;e things as a valuable con&s;ideration, and give the &s;ame force to contracts thereupon made, as to tho&s;e that pa&s;s between &s;trangers) it could have no relation to our que&s;tion concerning Kings. One prin|cipal rea&s;on that renders it very little nece&s;&s;ary by the Laws of Nations, to re&s;train the power of Parents over their Children is, becau&s;e 'tis pre|&s;um'd they cannot abu&s;e it: they are thought to have a Law in their Bowels, obliging them more &s;trictly to &s;eek their good, than all tho&s;e that can be laid upon them by another Power; and yet if they depart from it, &s;o as inhumanly to abu&s;e or kill their Children, they are puni&s;h'd with as much rigor, and accounted more unpardonable than other men. Igno|rance or wilful malice per&s;uading our Author to pa&s;s over all this, he bold|ly affirms, <HI>That the Father of a Family governs it by no other Law than his own Will;</HI> and from thence infers, that the condition of Kings is the &s;ame. He would &s;eem to &s;often the har&s;hne&s;s of this Propo&s;ition by &s;aying, <HI>That a King is always ty'd by the &s;ame Law of Nature to keep this general ground, that the &s;afety of the Kingdom is his chief Law.</HI> But he &s;poils it in the next page, by a&s;&s;erting, <HI>That it is not right for Kings to do injury, but it is right that they go unpuni&s;h'd by the People, if they do; &s;o that in this point it is all one, whether</HI> Samuel <HI>de&s;cribe a King or a Tyrant, for patient obedience is due un|to both; no remedy in the Text again&s;t Tyrants, but crying and praying unto God in that day.</HI> In this our Author, according to the cu&s;tom of Thea|ters, runs round in a Circle, pretends to grant that which is true, and then by a lie endeavours to de&s;troy all again. Kings by the Law of Na|ture are oblig'd to &s;eek chiefly the good of the Kingdom; but there is no remedy if they do it not: which is no le&s;s than to put all upon the Con|&s;cience of tho&s;e who manife&s;tly have none. But if God has appointed that all other tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of the Laws of Nature, by which a private man receives damage, &s;hould be puni&s;h'd in this world, notwith&s;tanding the right re&s;erv'd to him&s;elf of a future puni&s;hment; I de&s;ire to know, why this alone, by which whole Nations may be, and often are de&s;troy'd, &s;hould e&s;cape the hands of Ju&s;tice? If he pre&s;ume no Law to be nece&s;&s;ary in this ca&s;e, becau&s;e it cannot be thought that Kings will tran&s;gre&s;s, as there was no Law in <HI>Sparta</HI> again&s;t Adultery, becau&s;e it was not thought po&s;&s;ible for men educated under that di&s;ciplin, to be guilty of &s;uch a Crime; and as divers Nations left a liberty to Fathers to di&s;po&s;e of their Children as they thought fit, becau&s;e it could not be imagin'd that any one would abu&s;e that power; he ought to remember that the <HI>Spartans</HI> were mi&s;taken, and for want of that Law which they e&s;teem'd u&s;ele&s;s, Adul|terys became as common there as in any part of the world: and the other error being almo&s;t every where di&s;cover'd, the Laws of all civiliz'd Na|tions make it capital for a man to kill his Children; and give redre&s;s to Children, if they &s;uffer any other extreme injurys from their Parents, as well as to other per&s;ons. But tho this were not &s;o, it would be nothing to our que&s;tion, unle&s;s it could be &s;uppos'd, that whoever gets the power of a Nation into his hands, mu&s;t be immediately fill'd with the &s;ame tender|ne&s;s
<PB N="229" REF="233">
of affection to the People under him, as a Father naturally has to|wards   the Children he has begotten. He that is of this opinion, may examin the lives of <HI>Herod, Tiberius, Caligula,</HI> and &s;ome later Princes of like inclinations, and conclude it to be true, if he find that the whole cour&s;e of their actions, in relation to the People under them, do well &s;ute with the tender and &s;acred name of Father; and altogether fal&s;e, if he find the contrary. But &s;ince every man that con&s;iders what has bin, or &s;ees what is every day done in the world, mu&s;t confe&s;s, that Princes, or tho&s;e who govern them, do mo&s;t frequently &s;o utterly reject all thoughts of tenderne&s;s and piety towards the Nations under them, as rather to &s;eek what can be drawn from them, than what &s;hould be done for them, and &s;ometimes become their mo&s;t bitter and publick enemys; 'tis ridiculous to make the &s;afety of Nations to depend upon a &s;uppo&s;ition, which by daily experience we find to be fal&s;e; and impious, to prefer the lu&s;ts of a man who violates the mo&s;t &s;acred Laws of Nature, by de&s;troying tho&s;e he is oblig'd to pre&s;erve, before the welfare of that People for who&s;e good he is made to be what he is, if there be any thing of ju&s;tice in the Power he exerci&s;es.</P>
<P>Our Author fooli&s;hly thinks to cover the enormity of this non&s;en&s;e, by turning <HI>Salutem Populi</HI> into <HI>Salutem Regni:</HI> for tho <HI>Regnum</HI> may be taken for the power of commanding, in which &s;en&s;e the pre&s;ervation of it is the u&s;ual object of the care of Princes, yet it dos more rightly &s;ignify the Body of that Nation which is govern'd by a King. And therefore if the Maxim be true, as he acknowledges it to be, then <HI>Salus Populi e&s;t Lex &s;uprema;</HI> and the fir&s;t thing we are to inquire is, whether the Government of this or that man dos conduce to the accompli&s;hment of that &s;upreme Law, or not; for otherwi&s;e it ought to have bin &s;aid, <HI>Salus Regis e&s;t Lex &s;uprema,</HI> which certainly never enter'd into the head of a wi&s;er or better man than <HI>Filmer.</HI></P>
<P>His Rea&s;ons are as good as his Doctrin: <HI>No Law,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>can be im|pos'd on Kings, becau&s;e there were Kings before any Laws were made.</HI> This would not follow, tho the Propo&s;ition were true; for they, who impos'd no Laws upon the Kings they at fir&s;t made, from an opinion of their Vertue, as in tho&s;e call'd by the Antients <HI>Heroum regna,</HI> might lay re|&s;trictions upon them, when they were found not to an&s;wer the expecta|tion conceiv'd of them, or that their Succe&s;&s;ors degenerated from their Vertue. Other Nations al&s;o being in&s;tructed by the ill effects of an un|limited Power given to &s;ome Kings (if there was any &s;uch) might wi&s;e|ly avoid the Rock upon which their Neighbours had &s;plit, and ju&s;tly mo|derate that Power which had bin pernicious to others. However a Pro|po&s;ition of &s;o great importance ought to be prov'd; but that being hard, and perhaps impo&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e the original of Nations is almo&s;t wholly unknown to us, and their practice &s;eems to have bin &s;o various, that what is true in one is not &s;o in another; he is pleas'd only to affirm it, without giving the lea&s;t &s;hadow of a rea&s;on to per&s;uade us to believe him. This might ju&s;tify me, if I &s;hould reject his a&s;&s;ertion as a thing &s;aid <HI>gratis:</HI> but I may &s;afely go a &s;tep farther, and affirm, That men liv'd under Laws before there were any Kings; which cannot be deny'd, if &s;uch a Power nece&s;&s;arily belongs to Kings as he a&s;cribes to them. For <HI>Nimrod,</HI> who e&s;tabli&s;h'd his Kingdom in <HI>Babel,</HI> is the fir&s;t who by the Scripture is &s;aid to have bin a mighty one in the Earth. He was therefore the fir&s;t King, or Kings were not mighty; and he being the fir&s;t King, Mankind mu&s;t have liv'd till his time without Laws, or el&s;e Laws were made before
<PB N="230" REF="234">
  Kings. To &s;ay that there was then no Law, is in many re&s;pects mo&s;t ab&s;urd; for the Nature of man cannot be without it, and the violences committed by ill men before the Flood, could not have bin blam'd if there had bin no Law; for that which is not, cannot be tran&s;gre&s;t. <HI>Cain</HI> could not have fear'd that every man who met him would &s;lay him, if there had not bin a Law to &s;lay him that had &s;lain another. But in this ca&s;e the Scripture is clear, at lea&s;t from the time that <HI>Noah</HI> went out of the Ark; for God then gave him a Law &s;ufficient for the &s;tate of things at that time, if all violence was prohibited under the name of &s;hedding Blood, tho not under the &s;ame penalty as Murder. But Penal Laws be|ing in vain, if there be none to execute them, &s;uch as know God dos nothing in vain, may conclude that he who gave this Law, did appoint &s;ome way for its execution, tho unknown to us. There is therefore a Law not given by Kings, but laid upon &s;uch as &s;hould be Kings, as well as on any other Per&s;ons, by one who is above them; and perhaps I may &s;ay, that this Law pre&s;&s;es mo&s;t upon them, becau&s;e they who have mo&s;t power, do mo&s;t frequently break out into acts of Violence, and mo&s;t of all di&s;dain to have their Will re|&s;train'd: and he that will exempt Kings from this Law, mu&s;t either find that they are excepted in the Text, or that God who gave it has not a Power over them.</P>
<P>Moreover, it has bin prov'd at the beginning of this Treati&s;e, that the fir&s;t Kings were of the accur&s;ed race, and reign'd over the accur&s;ed Nations, whil&s;t the holy Seed had none. If therefore there was no Law where there was no King, the accur&s;ed Po&s;terity of <HI>Cham</HI> had Laws, when the ble&s;&s;ed De&s;cendents of <HI>Shem</HI> had none, which is mo&s;t ab&s;urd; the word <HI>Outlaw</HI> or <HI>Lawle&s;s,</HI> being often given to the wicked, but never to the ju&s;t and righteous.</P>
<P>The impious folly of &s;uch A&s;&s;ertions goes farther than our Author per|haps &s;u&s;pected: for if there be no Law where there is no King, the <HI>I&s;rae|lites</HI> had no Law till <HI>Saul</HI> was made King, and then the Law they had was from him. They had no King before, for they ask'd one. They could not have ask'd one of <HI>Samuel,</HI> if he had bin a King. He had not bin offend|ed, and God had not imputed to them the &s;in of rejecting him, if they had ask'd that only which he had &s;et over them. If <HI>Samuel</HI> were not King, <HI>Mo&s;es, Jo&s;hua,</HI> and the other Judges were not Kings; for they were no more than he. They had therefore no King, and con&s;equently, if our Author &s;ays true, no Law. If they had no Law till <HI>Saul</HI> was King, they never had any; for he gave them none; and the Prophets were to blame for denouncing judgments again&s;t them for receding from, or breaking their Law, if they had none. He cannot &s;ay that <HI>Samuel</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 10.</NOTE>gave them a Law; for that which he wrote in a Book, and laid up be|fore the Lord, was not a Law to the People, but to the King. If it had bin a Law to the People, it mu&s;t have bin made publick; but as it was only to the King, he laid it up before God, to te&s;tify again&s;t him if he &s;hould adventure to break it. Or if it was a Law to the People, the matter is not mended; for it was given in the time of a King by one who was not King. But in truth it was the Law of the Kingdom by which he was King, and had bin wholly impertinent, if it was not to bind him; for it was given to no other per&s;on, and to no other end.</P>
<P>Our Author's A&s;&s;ertion on which all his Doctrin is grounded, <HI>That there is no Nation that allows Children any action or remedy for being unju&s;tly go|vern'd,</HI> is as impudently fal&s;e as any other propos'd by him: for tho a Child
<PB N="231" REF="235">
will not be heard that complains of the Rod; yet our own Law gives   relief to Children again&s;t their Fathers, as well as again&s;t other per&s;ons that do them injurys, upon which we &s;ee many ill effects, and I do rather relate than commend the practice. In other places the Law gives relief again&s;t the extravagances of which Fathers may be guilty in relation to their Children, tho not to that exce&s;s as to bring them &s;o near to an equality as in <HI>England:</HI> They cannot impri&s;on, &s;ell, or kill their Chil|dren, without expo&s;ing them&s;elves to the &s;ame puni&s;hments with other men; and if they take their E&s;tates from them, the Law is open, and gives relief again&s;t them: but on the other &s;ide, Children are puni&s;h'd with Death, if they &s;trike or outrageou&s;ly abu&s;e their Parents; which is not &s;o with us.</P>
<P>Now, if the Laws of Nations take &s;uch care to pre&s;erve private men from being too hardly us'd by their true and natural Fathers, who have &s;uch a love and tenderne&s;s for them in their own Blood, that the mo&s;t wicked and barbarous do much more frequently commit crimes for them than again&s;t them; how much more nece&s;&s;ary is it to re&s;train the fury that Kings, who at the be&s;t are but phanta&s;tical Fathers, may exerci&s;e to the de&s;truction of the whole People? 'Tis a folly to &s;ay that <HI>David</HI> and &s;ome other Kings have had, or that all &s;hould have as tender an affection towards their People as towards their Children; for be&s;ides that even the fir&s;t Propo&s;ition is not acknowledg'd, and will be hard|ly verify'd in any one in&s;tance, there is a va&s;t di&s;tance between what men ought to be, and what they are. Every man ought to be ju&s;t, true and charitable; and if they were &s;o, Laws would be of no u&s;e: but it were a madne&s;s to aboli&s;h them upon a &s;uppo&s;ition that they are &s;o; or to leave them to a future puni&s;hment, which many do not believe, or not regard. I am not oblig'd to believe that <HI>David</HI> lov'd every <HI>I&s;raelite</HI> as well as his Son <HI>Ab&s;alom;</HI> but tho he had, I could not from thence infer that all Kings do &s;o, unle&s;s I were &s;ure that all of them were as wi&s;e and vertuous as he.</P>
<P>But to come more clo&s;e to the matter: Do we not know of many Kings who have come to their Power by the mo&s;t wicked means that can enter into the heart of man, even by the mo&s;t outrageous injurys done to the People, &s;ometimes by a foreign aid? as Kings were by the power of the <HI>Romans</HI> impos'd upon the <HI>Britans,</HI> that they might wa&s;t the Forces, and break the Spirits of that fierce people. This <HI>Tacitus</HI> acknowledges, and &s;ays, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inter in&s;trumenta &s;ervitutis reges habuere. <BIBL>Tacit.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>That among other in&s;truments of in&s;laving Nations, they im|pos'd Kings upon them.</HI> The <HI>Medices</HI> were made Ma&s;ters of <HI>Florence</HI> by the force of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth's Army. Sometimes by a corrupt party in their own Country they have de&s;troy'd the be&s;t men, and &s;ubdu'd the re&s;t; as <HI>Agathocles, Diony&s;ius,</HI> and <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> did at <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Syracu&s;e.</HI> Others taking upon them to defend a People, have turn'd the Arms with which they were entru&s;ted again&s;t their own Ma&s;ters; as <HI>France&s;co Sforza,</HI> who being cho&s;en by tho&s;e of <HI>Milan</HI> to be their General again&s;t the <HI>Venetians,</HI> made peace with them, and by their a&s;&s;i&s;tance made him&s;elf Prince, or, in our Author's phra&s;e, Father of that great City. If the&s;e be acts of ten|derne&s;s, love, ju&s;tice, and charity, tho&s;e who commit them may well think they have gain'd the affections of their People, and grow to love tho&s;e from whom they fear nothing, and by whom they think they are
<PB N="232" REF="236">
  lov'd. But if on the other hand they know they have attain'd to their greatne&s;s by the wor&s;t of all Villanys, and that they are on that account become the object of the publick hatred, they can do no le&s;s than hate and fear tho&s;e by whom they know them&s;elves to be hated. The <HI>Italians</HI> ordinarily &s;ay that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chi fa in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">uria non perdona mai.</NOTE>he who dos an injury never pardons, becau&s;e he thinks he is never pardon'd: But he that en&s;laves and oppre&s;&s;es a People dos an injury which can never be pardon'd, and therefore fears it will be re|veng'd.</P>
<P>Other Princes who come to their Thrones by better ways, and are not contented with the power that the Law allows, draw the &s;ame hatred upon them&s;elves when they endeavour by force or fraud to enlarge it; and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily fear and hate their own People as much as he who by the ways beforemention'd has betray'd or &s;ubdu'd them. Our Author makes nothing of this; but taking it for granted that it was all one whether <HI>Samuel</HI> &s;poke of a King or a Tyrant, declares that the &s;ame patient obe|dience is due to both; but not being pleas'd to give any rea&s;on why we &s;hould believe him, I intend to offer &s;ome why we &s;hould not.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, there is nothing in the nature or in&s;titution of Monarchy that obliges Nations to bear the exorbitances of it when it degenerates into Tyranny.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd place, we have no precept for it.</P>
<P>Thirdly, we have many approv'd examples, and occa&s;ional particular commands to the contrary.</P>
<P>1. To the fir&s;t: The point of Paternity being explain'd; the duty of Children to Parents prov'd to proceed from the benefits receiv'd from them, and that the power over them, which at the fir&s;t &s;eems to have bin left at large, becau&s;e it was thought they would never abu&s;e it, has long &s;ince bin much re&s;train'd in all civiliz'd Nations, and particularly in our own; We may conclude that men are all made of the &s;ame pa&s;te, and that one ows no more to another than another to him, unle&s;s for &s;ome benefit re|ceiv'd, or by virtue of &s;ome promi&s;e made. The duty ari&s;ing from a benefit receiv'd mu&s;t be proportionable to it: that which grows from a promi&s;e is determin'd by the promi&s;e or contract made, according to the true &s;en&s;e and meaning of it. He therefore that would know what the <HI>Babylonians, Hebrews, Athenians,</HI> or <HI>Romans</HI> did owe to <HI>Nimrod, Saul, The&s;eus</HI> or <HI>Romulus,</HI> mu&s;t inquire what benefits were receiv'd from them, or what was promis'd to them. It cannot be &s;aid that any thing was due to them for the &s;ake of their Parents; they could have no prerogative by birth: <HI>Nimrod</HI> was the &s;ixth Son of <HI>Chu&s;h</HI> the Son of <HI>Cham,</HI> who was the younge&s;t Son of <HI>Noah;</HI> his Kingdom was erected whil&s;t <HI>Noah</HI> and his elder Sons <HI>Shem</HI> and <HI>Japhet,</HI> as well as <HI>Cham, Chu&s;h</HI> and his elder Sons were &s;till living. <HI>Saul</HI> was the Son of <HI>Chi&s;h,</HI> a man of <HI>Benjamin,</HI> who was the younge&s;t Son of <HI>Jacob;</HI> and he was cho&s;en in the mo&s;t Democra|tical way by Lot among&s;t the whole People. <HI>The&s;eus</HI> according to the cu&s;tom of the times pretended to be the Son of <HI>Neptune;</HI> and <HI>Rhea</HI> was &s;o well pleas'd with the Soldier that had gotten her with child, that &s;he re&s;olv'd to think or &s;ay that <HI>Mars</HI> was the Father of the Children, that is to &s;ay they were Ba&s;tards; and therefore whatever was due to them was
<PB N="233" REF="237">
upon their own per&s;onal account, without any regard to their Progeni|tors.   This mu&s;t be mea&s;ur'd according to what they did for tho&s;e Na|tions before they were Kings, or by the manner of their advancement. No|thing can be pretended before they were Kings: <HI>Nimrod</HI> ro&s;e up after the con|fu&s;ion of Languages, and the People that under&s;tood the tongue he &s;poke, follow'd him; <HI>Saul</HI> was a young man unknown in <HI>I&s;rael; The&s;eus</HI> and <HI>Ro|mulus</HI> had nothing to recommend them before other <HI>Athenians</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> except the reputation of their Valor; and the Honors confer'd upon them for that rea&s;on, mu&s;t proceed from expectation or hope, and not from gratitude or obligation. It mu&s;t therefore proceed from the manner by which they came to be Kings. He that neither is nor has any title to be a King, can come to be &s;o only by force or by con&s;ent. If by force, he dos not confer a Benefit upon the People, but injures them in the mo&s;t out|rageous manner. If it be po&s;&s;ible therefore or rea&s;onable to imagin that one man did ever &s;ubdue a multitude, he can no otherwi&s;e re&s;emble a Father, than the wor&s;t of all Enemys who dos the greate&s;t mi&s;chiefs, re&s;embles the be&s;t of all Friends who confers the mo&s;t ine&s;timable bene|fits; and con&s;equently dos as ju&s;tly de&s;erve the utmo&s;t effects of hatred, as the other dos of love, re&s;pect, and &s;ervice. If by con&s;ent, he who is rais'd from among&s;t the people, and plac'd above his Brethren, receives great honors and advantages, but confers none. The obligations of gra|titude are on his &s;ide, and what&s;oever he dos in acknowledgment to his Benefactors for their love to him, is no more than his duty; and he can demand no more from them than what they think fit to add to the favors already receiv'd. If more be pretended, it mu&s;t be by virtue of that contract, and can no otherwi&s;e be prov'd than by producing it to be exa|min'd, that the true &s;en&s;e, meaning, and intention of it may be known.</P>
<P>This Contract mu&s;t be in form and &s;ub&s;tance according to a general Rule given to all mankind, or &s;uch as is left to the will of every Nation. If a general one be pretended, it ought to be &s;hown, that by inquiring into the contents, we may under&s;tand the force and extent of it. If this cannot be done, it may ju&s;tly pa&s;s for a fiction, no conclu&s;ion can be drawn from it; and we may be &s;ure, that what Contracts &s;oever have bin made between Nations and their Kings, have bin fram'd ac|cording to the will of tho&s;e Nations; and con&s;equently how many &s;oever they are, and what&s;oever the &s;en&s;e of any or all of them may be, they can oblige no man, except tho&s;e, or at the mo&s;t the De&s;cendents of tho&s;e that made them. Whoever therefore would per&s;uade us, that one or more Nations are, by virtue of tho&s;e Contracts, bound to bear all the in&s;olences of Tyrants, is oblig'd to &s;how, that by tho&s;e Contracts they did for ever indefinitely bind them&s;elves &s;o to do, how great &s;oever they might be.</P>
<P>I may ju&s;tly go a &s;tep farther, and affirm, That if any &s;uch &s;hould ap|pear in the world, the folly and turpitude of the thing would be a &s;uffi|cient evidence of the madne&s;s of tho&s;e that made it, and utterly de&s;troy the contents of it: but no &s;uch having bin as yet produc'd, nor any rea&s;on given to per&s;uade a wi&s;e man, that there has ever bin any &s;uch, at lea&s;t among civiliz'd Nations, (for whom only we are concern'd) it may be concluded there never was any; or i&s; there were, they do not at all relate to our &s;ubject; and con&s;equently that Nations &s;till continue in their na|tive Liberty, and are no otherwi&s;e oblig'd to endure the in&s;olence of Ty|rants, than they, or each of them may e&s;teem them tolerable.</P>

  2. To the &s;econd: Tho the words of <HI>Samuel</HI> had imply'd a nece&s;&s;ity incumbent upon the <HI>Hebrews</HI> to bear all the Injurys that their Kings &s;hould do to them, it could no way relate to us; for he dos not &s;peak of all Kings, but of &s;uch as they had ask'd, even &s;uch as reign'd over the &s;lavi&s;h <HI>A&s;ia|ticks</HI> their Neighbors, who are no le&s;s infamous in the world for their ba&s;ene&s;s and cowardice, than dete&s;table for their idolatry and vices. It was not a plot or trick of <HI>Samuel</HI> to keep the Government in him&s;elf and Family; &s;uch &s;currilous expre&s;&s;ions or thoughts are fit only for <HI>Filmer, Heylin,</HI> and their Di&s;ciples: But the Prophet being troubled at the folly and wickedne&s;s of the people, who cho&s;e rather to &s;ubject them&s;elves to the irregular Will of a Man, than to be govern'd by God and his Law, did, by the immediate command of God, declare to them what would be the event of their fury; that &s;ince they would be like to their Neigh|bors in &s;in and folly, he told 'em they &s;hould be like to them in &s;hame and mi&s;ery; &s;ince they de&s;ir'd to ca&s;t off the thing that was good, they &s;hould &s;uffer evil as the product of their own Coun&s;els; and that when they &s;hould cry to the Lord from a &s;en&s;e of their mi&s;erys, he dos not tell them, as our Author fal&s;ly &s;ays, they &s;hould have no other remedy again&s;t Ty|rants but crying and praying, but that their crys and prayers &s;hould not be heard. It was ju&s;t that when they had rejected God, he &s;hould reject them, and leave them under the weight of the calamitys they had brought upon them&s;elves. In all other ca&s;es God had ever &s;aid, that when his People return'd to him, he would hear and &s;ave them. When they cry'd by rea&s;on of the oppre&s;&s;ions they &s;uffer'd under the <HI>Egyptians, Cananites, Midianites, Phili&s;tins,</HI> and others, tho their crimes had de&s;erv'd them all, yet God heard and reliev'd them. But when they meditated this final defection from his Law, and rejection of his Government, God &s;eem'd to change his Nature, and forget to be gracious; <HI>When ye &s;hall cry to me by rea&s;on of your King, I will not hear you.</HI> This was the &s;tronge&s;t de|hortation from their wicked Intention that can be imagin'd; but being not enough to reclaim them, they an&s;wer'd, <HI>Nay, but we will have a King.</HI> They were like to their Neighbors in folly and vice, and would be like to them in Government; which brought all the Calamitys upon them that the others &s;uffer'd. But I know not what conclu&s;ion can be drawn from hence in favor of our Author's Doctrin, unle&s;s all Nations are oblig'd furiou&s;ly to run into the &s;ame crimes with the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> or to take upon them&s;elves the &s;ame puni&s;hment, tho they do not commit the &s;ame crimes.</P>
<P>If this was not a Precept to the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> in&s;tructing them what they &s;hould do, but a denunciation of what they &s;hould &s;uffer for the evil which they had committed, the Old Te&s;tament will afford none; and I hope in due time to an&s;wer &s;uch as he alledges from the New. Nay, we may conclude there can be none there, becau&s;e being dictated by the &s;ame Spirit, which is always uniform and con&s;tant to it &s;elf, it could not agree with the 17<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Deuteron.</HI> which &s;o extremely re&s;trains &s;uch a King as God allow'd, as not to &s;uffer him in any manner to rai&s;e his heart above his Brethren; and was &s;aid in vain, if at the &s;ame time it gave him a Power which might not be re&s;i&s;ted, or forbad others to re&s;i&s;t him if he would not obey the Law.</P>

<HI>Ehud, Barak, Gideon, Samp&s;on, Jephtha, Samuel,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Judges,   comes expre&s;ly under the particular Precepts and Examples promis'd by me, to &s;how, that God had occa&s;ionally commanded, and his Servants executed his Commands in re&s;i&s;ting and de&s;troying the Per&s;ons of Kings, who were their own Kings al&s;o, if Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was only to be regarded. And tho this be &s;ufficient to overthrow our Author's Doctrin; <HI>That we are not to examin the Titles of Kings, whether they be from u&s;urpation, or any other means; but only to look upon the Power:</HI> Yet they who &s;eek Truth, ought not to content them&s;elves merely with Victory; or to e&s;teem that a Victory, which is obtain'd by what the Schools call <HI>Argumentum ad hominem,</HI> grounded upon a fal&s;e Propo&s;ition, and is of no force except again&s;t tho&s;e who are &s;o ill advis'd to advance it.

This is prov'd by the Example of <HI>Saul;</HI> Tho the people &s;inn'd grievou&s;ly in asking a King, yet God a&s;&s;enting to their demand, no Prince was ever more &s;olemnly in&s;tituted than he. The People cho&s;e him by Lot from among&s;t all the Tribes, and he was plac'd in the Throne by the general con&s;ent of the whole Nation: But he turning his lawful Power into Ty|ranny, di&s;obeying the word of the Prophet, &s;laying the Prie&s;ts, &s;paring the <HI>Amalekites,</HI> and oppre&s;&s;ing the Innocent, overthrew his own Right; and God declar'd the Kingdom, which had bin given him under a con|ditional promi&s;e of perpetuity, to be intirely abrogated. This did not only give a right to the whole People of oppo&s;ing him, but to every par|ticular man; and upon this account <HI>David</HI> did not only fly from his fury, but re&s;i&s;ted it. He made him&s;elf head of all the di&s;contented Per&s;ons that would follow him: he had at fir&s;t four, and afterwards &s;ix hundred men; he kept the&s;e in Arms again&s;t <HI>Saul,</HI> liv'd upon the Country, and re&s;olv'd to de&s;troy <HI>Nabal</HI> with all his Hou&s;e, only for refu&s;ing to &s;end Provi&s;ions for his men. Finding him&s;elf weak and un&s;afe, he went to <HI>Achi&s;h</HI> the <HI>Phili&s;tin,</HI> and offer'd his &s;ervice even again&s;t <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> This was never re|puted a &s;in in <HI>David,</HI> or in tho&s;e that follow'd him, by any except the wicked Court-flatterer <HI>Doeg</HI> the <HI>Edomite,</HI> and the drunken fool <HI>Nabal,</HI> who is &s;aid to have bin a man of <HI>Belial.</HI></P>
<P>If it be objected, That this was rather a Flight than a War, in as much as he neither kill'd <HI>Saul</HI> nor his men, or that he made war as a King anointed by <HI>Samuel;</HI> I an&s;wer, that he who had &s;ix hundred men, and entertain'd as many as came to him, &s;ufficiently &s;hew'd his intention rather to re&s;i&s;t than to fly: And no other rea&s;on can be given why he did not farther pur&s;ue that intention, than that he had no greater power: and he who arms &s;ix hundred men again&s;t his Prince, when he can have no more, can no more be &s;aid to obey patiently, than if he had &s;o many
<PB N="236" REF="240">
  hundreds of thou&s;ands. This holds, tho he kills no man, for that is not the War, but the manner of making it: and 'twere as ab&s;urd to &s;ay <HI>David</HI> made no War, becau&s;e he kill'd no men, as that <HI>Charles</HI> the eighth made no War in <HI>Italy,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>Guicciardin</HI> &s;ays, he conquer'd <HI>Naples</HI> without breaking a Lance. But as <HI>David</HI>'s &s;trength increas'd, he grew to be le&s;s &s;paring of Blood. Tho&s;e who &s;ay Kings never die, but that the right is immediately transfer'd to the next Heirs, cannot deny that <HI>I&s;hbo&s;heth</HI> inherited the right of <HI>Saul,</HI> and that <HI>David</HI> had no other right of making war again&s;t him, than again&s;t <HI>Saul,</HI> unle&s;s it were confer'd upon him by the Tribe of <HI>Judah</HI> that made him King. If this be true, it mu&s;t be confe&s;t that not only a whole People, but a part of them, may at their own plea&s;ure abrogate a Kingdom, tho never &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;h'd by common con&s;ent; for none was ever more &s;olemnly in&s;tituted than that of <HI>Saul;</HI> and few Subjects have more &s;trongly oblig'd them&s;elves to be obedient. If it be not true, the example of <HI>Nabal</HI> is to be follow'd; and <HI>David,</HI> tho guided by the Spirit of God, de&s;erves to be condemn'd as a fellow that ro&s;e up again&s;t his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>If to elude this it be &s;aid, That God in&s;tituted and abrogated <HI>Saul</HI>'s Kingdom, and that <HI>David</HI> to whom the right was tran&s;mitted, might therefore proceed again&s;t him and his Heirs as privat men: I an&s;wer, that if the obedience due to <HI>Saul</HI> proceeded from God's In&s;titution, it can ex|tend to none but tho&s;e who are &s;o peculiarly in&s;tituted and anointed by his Command, and the hand of his Prophet, which will be of little advan|tage to the Kings that can give no te&s;timony of &s;uch an In&s;titution or Unction; and an indi&s;putable right will remain to every Nation of abro|gating the Kingdoms which are in&s;tituted by and for them&s;elves. But as <HI>David</HI> re&s;i&s;ted the Authority of <HI>Saul</HI> and <HI>I&s;hbo&s;heth,</HI> without a&s;&s;uming the Power of a King, tho de&s;ign'd by God, and anointed by the Prophet, till he was made King of <HI>Judah</HI> by that Tribe; or arrogating to him&s;elf a Power over the other Tribes till he was made King by them, and had enter'd into a Covenant with them; 'tis much more certain that the Per|&s;ons and Authority of ill Kings, who have no title to the Privileges due to <HI>Saul</HI> by virtue of his in&s;titution, may be ju&s;tly re&s;i&s;ted; which is as much as is nece&s;&s;ary to my purpo&s;e.</P>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 26.</NOTE>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> But <HI>David</HI>'s Heart &s;mote him when he had cut off the skirt of <HI>Saul</HI>'s Garment, and he would not &s;uffer <HI>Abi&s;hai</HI> to kill him. This might be of &s;ome force, if it were pretended that every man was oblig'd to kill an ill King, when&s;oever he could do it, which I think no man ever did &s;ay; and no man having ever affirm'd it, no more can be concluded than is confe&s;t by all. But how is it po&s;&s;ible that a man of a generous Spirit, like <HI>David,</HI> could &s;ee a great and valiant King, cho&s;en from among&s;t all the Tribes of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> anointed by the command of God and the hand of the Prophet, famous for victorys obtain'd again&s;t the enemys of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and a wonderful deliverance thereby purchas'd to that People, ca&s;t at his feet to receive Life or Death from the hand of one whom he had &s;o furi|ou&s;ly per&s;ecuted, and from whom he lea&s;t de&s;erv'd, and could lea&s;t expect mercy, without extraordinary commotion of mind, mo&s;t e&s;pecially when <HI>Abi&s;hai,</HI> who &s;aw all that he did, and thereby ought be&s;t to have known his thoughts, expre&s;t &s;o great a readine&s;s to kill him? This could not but make him reflect upon the in&s;tability of all that &s;eem'd to be mo&s;t glorious in men, and &s;hew him that if <HI>Saul,</HI> who had bin nam'd even among the Prophets, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in an extraordinary manner to accompli&s;h &s;uch great things, was &s;o abandon'd and given over to fury, mi&s;ery and &s;hame;
<PB N="237" REF="241">
he that &s;eem'd to be mo&s;t firmly e&s;tabli&s;h'd ought to take care le&s;t he   &s;hould fall.</P>
<P>Surely the&s;e things are neither to be thought &s;trange in relation to <HI>Saul,</HI> who was God's Anointed, nor communicable to &s;uch as are not: Some may &s;uppo&s;e he was King by virtue of God's unction (tho if that were true, he had never bin cho&s;en and made King by the People) but it were madne&s;s to think he became God's Anointed by being King: for if that were &s;o, the &s;ame Right and Title would belong to every King, even to tho&s;e who by his command were accurs'd and de&s;troy'd by his Servants <HI>Mo&s;es, Jo&s;hua</HI> and <HI>Samuel.</HI> The &s;ame men, at the &s;ame time, and in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, would be both his anointed and accurs'd, lov'd and dete&s;ted by him, and the mo&s;t &s;acred Privileges made to extend to the wor&s;t of his enemys.</P>
<P>Again; the War made by <HI>David</HI> was not upon the account of being King, as anointed by <HI>Samuel,</HI> but upon the common natural right of de|fending him&s;elf again&s;t the violence and fury of a wicked man; he tru&s;t|ed to the promi&s;e, <HI>that he &s;hould be King,</HI> but knew that as yet he was not &s;o: and when <HI>Saul</HI> found he had &s;par'd his Life, he &s;aid, <HI>I now know well that thou &s;halt &s;urely be King, and that the Kingdom of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>&s;hall &s;urely be e&s;tabli&s;h'd in thy hand;</HI> not that it was already Nay <HI>David</HI> him|&s;elf was &s;o far from taking upon him to be King, till the Tribe of <HI>Judah</HI> had cho&s;en him, that he often acknowledg'd <HI>Saul</HI> to be his Lord. When <HI>Baanah</HI> and <HI>Rechab</HI> brought the head of <HI>I&s;hbo&s;heth</HI> to him, he commanded them to be &s;lain; <HI>Becau&s;e they had kill'd a righteous man upon his Bed, in</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 4.</NOTE><HI>his own Hou&s;e;</HI> which he could not have &s;aid, if <HI>I&s;hbo&s;heth</HI> had unju&s;tly detain'd from him the ten Tribes, and that he had a right to reign over them before they had cho&s;en him. The Word of God did not make him King, but only foretold that he &s;hould be King; and by &s;uch ways as he pleas'd prepar'd the hearts of the People to &s;et him up; and till the time de&s;ign'd by God for that work was accompli&s;h'd, he pretended to no other Authority, than what the &s;ix hundred men who fir&s;t follow'd him, afterwards the Tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> and at la&s;t all the re&s;t of the Peo|ple, confer'd upon him.</P>
<P>I no way defend <HI>Ab&s;alom</HI>'s revolt; he was wicked, and acted wicked|ly: but after his death no man was ever blam'd or que&s;tion'd for &s;iding with him; and <HI>Ama&s;a</HI> who commanded his Army, is repre&s;ented in Scripture as a good man, even <HI>David</HI> &s;aying, that <HI>Joab,</HI> by &s;laying <HI>Abner</HI> and <HI>Ama&s;a,</HI> had kill'd <HI>two men who were better than him&s;elf:</HI> which could <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 20&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE>not have bin, unle&s;s the People had a right of looking into matters of Go|vernment, and of redre&s;&s;ing abu&s;es; tho being deceiv'd by <HI>Ab&s;alom,</HI> they &s;o far err'd, as to prefer him, who was in all re&s;pects wicked, before the man, who, except in the matter of <HI>&V;riah,</HI> is &s;aid to be after God's own heart. This right was acknowledg'd by <HI>David</HI> him&s;elf, when he com|manded <HI>Hu&s;hai</HI> to &s;ay to <HI>Ab&s;alom, I will be thy Servant, O King;</HI> and by <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Kings.</NOTE><HI>Hu&s;hai</HI> in the following Chapter, <HI>Nay, but whom the Lord and his People, and all the men of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>chu&s;e, his will I be, and with him will I abide:</HI> which could have no &s;en&s;e in it, unle&s;s the People had a right of chu&s;ing, and that the choice in which they generally concur'd, was e&s;teem'd to be from God.</P>
<P>But if <HI>Saul,</HI> who was made King by the whole People, and anointed by the command of God, might be lawfully re&s;i&s;ted when he departed from the Law of his In&s;titution; it cannot be doubted that any other for the like rea&s;on may be re&s;i&s;ted.

<HEAD>SECT. II. The Kings of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and <HI>Judah</HI> were under a Law not &s;afely to be tran&s;gre&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author might be pardon'd if he only vented his own follys; but he aggravates his crime, by imputing them to men of more Credit; and tho I cannot look upon Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> as a very good In|terpreter of Scripture, he had too much under&s;tanding to &s;ay, <HI>That if practice declare the greatne&s;s of Authority, even the be&s;t Kings of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>and</HI> Judah <HI>were not ty'd to any Law, but they did what&s;oever they pleas'd in the greate&s;t matters;</HI> for there is no &s;en&s;e in tho&s;e words. <HI>If Practice declares the greatne&s;s of Authority, even the be&s;t of Kings were ty'd to no Law,</HI> &s;igni|fies nothing, for Practice cannot declare the greatne&s;s of Authority. <HI>Peter</HI> the Cruel of <HI>Ca&s;tille,</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tiern</HI> the 2<HI>d</HI> of <HI>Denmark,</HI> kill'd whom they pleas'd; but no man ever thought they had therefore a right to do &s;o: and if there was a Law, all were ty'd by it, and the be&s;t were le&s;s likely to break it than the wor&s;t. But if Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI>'s opinion, which <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 L.

The Tribes that did not &s;ubmit to <HI>David,</HI> nor crown him till they thought fit, and then made a Covenant with him, took care it might be ob&s;erv'd whether he would or not. <HI>Ab&s;alom</HI>'s Rebellion follow'd by almo&s;t all <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> was a terrible check to his Will. That of <HI>Sheba,</HI> the Son of <HI>Bichri,</HI> was like to have bin wor&s;e, if it had not bin &s;uppre&s;t by <HI>Joab</HI>'s diligence; and <HI>David</HI> often confe&s;t the Sons of <HI>Zerviah</HI> were too hard for him. <HI>Solomon</HI> indeed, overthrowing the Law given by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> multiplying Gold and Silver, Wives and Hor&s;es, introducing Idolatry,

and lifting up his heart above his Brethren, did what he pleas'd; but <HI>Re|hoboam</HI>   paid for all: the ten Tribes revolted from him, by rea&s;on of the heavy burdens laid upon them; &s;ton'd <HI>Adoram</HI> who was &s;ent to levy the Tributes, and &s;et up <HI>Jeroboam,</HI> who, as Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> &s;ays in the place before cited, had no other Title than the courte&s;y of the People, and utterly rejected the hou&s;e of <HI>David.</HI> If practice therefore declares a right, the practice of the People to avenge the injurys they &s;uffer'd from their Kings, as &s;oon as they found a man fit to be their Leader, &s;hews they had a right of doing it.</P>
<P>'Tis true, the be&s;t of the Kings, with <HI>Mo&s;es, Jo&s;hua,</HI> and <HI>Samuel,</HI> may in one &s;en&s;e be &s;aid to have done what they pleas'd, becau&s;e they de&s;ir'd to do that only which was good. But this will hardly be brought to con|fer a right upon all Kings: And I deny that even the Kings of <HI>Judah</HI> did what they pleas'd, or that it were any thing to our que&s;tion if they did. <HI>Zedekiah</HI> profe&s;t to the great men (that is, to the <HI>Sanhedrin) that without</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jerem. 38.</NOTE><HI>them he could do nothing.</HI> When <HI>Amaziah,</HI> by his folly, had brought a great &s;laughter upon the Tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> they con&s;pir'd again&s;t him in Publick Council; whereupon he fled to <HI>Lachi&s;h,</HI> and they pur&s;uing him <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Kings 14.</NOTE>thither, kill'd him, avow'd the Fact, and it was neither que&s;tion'd, nor blam'd: which examples agree with the paraphra&s;e of <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> on <HI>Deut.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Antiq. Jud</NOTE>17. <HI>He &s;hall do nothing without the con&s;ent of the</HI> Sanhedrin; <HI>and if he at|tempt it, they &s;hall hinder him.</HI> This was the Law of God, not to be ab|rogated by Man; a Law of Liberty directly oppo&s;ite to the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubmitting to the will of a man. This was a Gift be&s;tow'd by God upon his Children and People; whereas &s;lavery was a great part of the Cur&s;e denounc'd again&s;t <HI>Cham</HI> for his wickedne&s;s, and perpetually incumbent upon his Po&s;terity. The great <HI>Sanhedrin</HI> were con&s;tituted Judges, as <HI>Grotius</HI> &s;ays, mo&s;t particularly of &s;uch matters as concern'd their Kings; and <HI>Maimonides</HI> affirms, that the Kings were judg'd by them: The di&s;tri|bution of the power to the inferior <HI>Sanhedrins,</HI> in every Tribe and City, with the right of calling the People together in general A&s;&s;emblys as often as occa&s;ion requir'd, were the foundations of their Liberty; and being added to the Law of the Kingdom pre&s;crib'd in the 17<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> if they &s;hould think fit to have a King, e&s;tabli&s;h'd the Freedom of that People upon a &s;olid foundation. And tho in their fury they did in a great mea&s;ure wave the benefits God had be&s;tow'd upon 'em; yet there was enough left to re&s;train the Lu&s;ts of their Kings. <HI>Ahab</HI> did not treat with <HI>Naboth</HI> as with a Servant, who&s;e Per&s;on and E&s;tate depended upon his Will; and dos not &s;eem to have bin &s;o tender-hearted to grieve much for his refu&s;al, if by virtue of his Royal Authority he could have taken away his Vineyard and his Life: But that failing, he had no other way of ac|compli&s;hing his de&s;ign, than by the fraud of his accur&s;ed Wife, and the perfidious Wretches &s;he imploy'd. And no better proof that it did fail, can rea&s;onably be requir'd, than that he was oblig'd to have recour&s;e to &s;uch &s;ordid, odious, and dangerous Remedys: But we are furni&s;h'd with one that is more unque&s;tionable; <HI>Ha&s;t thou kill'd, and al&s;o taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion?</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Kings 21.</NOTE><HI>In the place where Dogs lick'd the blood of</HI> Naboth, <HI>&s;hall they lick thy Blood, even thine.</HI> This &s;hews that the Kings were not only under a Law, but under a Law of equality with the re&s;t of the People, even that of Reta|liation. He had rais'd his heart above his Brethren; but God brought him down, and made him to &s;uffer what he had done; he was in all re&s;pects wicked, but the ju&s;tice of this &s;entence con&s;i&s;ted in the Law he had broken, which could not have bin, if he had bin &s;ubject to none.

<HEAD>SECT. III. <HI>Samuel</HI> did not de&s;cribe to the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> the glory of a free Monarchy; but the Evils the People &s;hould &s;uffer, that he might divert them from de&s;iring a King.</HEAD>
<P>THO no re&s;traint had bin put upon the Hebrew Kings, it could be no prejudice to any other Nation. They deflected from the Law of God; and rejecting him that he &s;hould reign over them no longer, they fell into that mi&s;ery which could affect none but tho&s;e who enjoy the &s;ame Ble&s;&s;ings, and with the &s;ame fury de&s;pi&s;e them. If their Kings had more Power than con&s;i&s;ted with their welfare, they gave it, and God renounces the in&s;titution of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ye have cho&s;en Kings, but not by me; and Princes, but I know them not. <BIBL>Ho&s;.</BIBL></NOTE>&s;uch. He gave them a Law of Liberty; and if they fell into the &s;hame and mi&s;ery that accompanys &s;lavery, it was their own work. They were not oblig'd to have any King; and could not without a crime have any but one, who mu&s;t not rai&s;e his heart above the re&s;t of them. This was taught by <HI>Mo&s;es:</HI> And <HI>Samuel,</HI> who &s;poke by the &s;ame Spirit, could not contradict him; and in telling the People what &s;uch a King as they de&s;ir'd would do when he &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;h'd, he did announce to them the mi&s;ery they would bring upon them&s;elves, by chu&s;ing &s;uch a one as he had forbidden. This free Mo|narchy, which our Author thinks to be &s;o maje&s;tically de&s;crib'd, was not only di&s;plea&s;ing to the Prophet, but declar'd by God to be a rejection of him, and incon&s;i&s;tent with his reign over them. This might have bin &s;ufficient to divert any other people from their furious re&s;olution; but the Prophet farther enforcing his di&s;&s;ua&s;ion, told them, that God (who had in all other ca&s;es bin their helper) would not hear them when they &s;hould cry to him by rea&s;on of their King. This is the maje&s;tick de&s;crip|tion of that free Monarchy with which our Author is &s;o much pleas'd: It was di&s;plea&s;ing to the Prophet, hateful to God, an aggravation of all the crimes they had committed &s;ince they came out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and that which would bring (as it did) mo&s;t certain and irreparable de&s;truction upon them.</P>
<P>But it &s;eems the Regal Maje&s;ty in that Age was in its infancy, and little in compari&s;on of that which we find de&s;crib'd by <HI>Tacitus, Suetonius,</HI> and others in later times. He &s;hall take your Sons, &s;ays <HI>Samuel,</HI> and &s;et them over his Chariots, and your Daughters to make them Confectioners and Cooks; but the Maje&s;ty of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors was carry'd to a higher pitch of Glory. <HI>Ahab</HI> could not, without employing treachery and fraud, get a &s;mall &s;pot of ground for his mony to make a Garden of Herbs: But
<PB N="241" REF="247">
<HI>Tiberius, Caligula</HI> and <HI>Nero</HI> kill'd whom they pleas'd, and took what they   pleas'd of their E&s;tates. When they had &s;atiated their cruelty and ava|rice by the murders and confi&s;cations of the mo&s;t eminent and be&s;t men, they commonly expos'd their Children to the Lu&s;t of their Slaves. If the power of doing evil be glorious, the utmo&s;t exce&s;s is its perfection; and 'tis pity that <HI>Samuel</HI> knew no more of the effects produc'd by unre&s;train'd Lu&s;t, that he might have made the de&s;cription yet more maje&s;tick: and as nothing can be &s;uffer'd by man beyond con&s;tupration, torments and death, in&s;tead of &s;uch trifles as he mention'd, he might have &s;hew'd them the effects of Fury in its greate&s;t exaltation.</P>
<P>If it be good for a Nation to live under &s;uch a Power, why did not God of his own goodne&s;s in&s;titute it? Did his Wi&s;dom and Love to his People fail? or if he him&s;elf had not &s;et up the be&s;t Government over them, could he be di&s;pleas'd with them for asking it? Did he &s;eparate that Nation from the re&s;t of Mankind, to make their condition wor&s;e than that of others? Or can they be &s;aid to have &s;in'd and rejected God, when they de&s;ir'd nothing but the Government, which by a perpetual Ordinance he had e&s;tabli&s;h'd over all the Nations of the World? Is not the Law of Nature a Rule which he has given to things? and the Law of man's Na|ture, which is Rea&s;on, an emanation of the divine Wi&s;dom, or &s;ome foot&s;teps of divine Light remaining in us? Is it po&s;&s;ible that this which is from God, can be contrary to his Will; and can he be offended with tho&s;e who de&s;ire to live in a conformity to that Law? Or could it ju&s;tly be &s;aid, The People had cho&s;en that which is not good, if nothing in Go|vernment be good but what they cho&s;e?</P>
<P>But as the wor&s;t men delight in the wor&s;t things, and Fools are pleas'd with the mo&s;t extreme ab&s;urditys, our Author not only gives the highe&s;t prai&s;es to that which bears &s;o many marks of God's hatred; but after hav|ing &s;aid that <HI>Abraham, I&s;aac, Jacob,</HI> and <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> were Kings, he tells us, <HI>The</HI> I&s;raelites <HI>beg'd a King of</HI> Samuel; which had bin impertinent, if the Magi&s;trats in&s;tituted by the Law were Kings: and tho it might be a folly in them to ask what they had already, it could be no &s;in to de&s;ire that which they enjoy'd by the Ordinance of God. If they were not Kings, it follows that the only Government &s;et up by God among&s;t men wanted the principal part, even the Head and Foundation, from whence all the other parts have their action and being; that is, God's Law is again&s;t God's Law, and de&s;troys it &s;elf.</P>
<P>But if God did neither by a general and perpetual Ordinance e&s;tabli&s;h over all Nations the Monarchy which <HI>Samuel</HI> de&s;cribes, nor pre&s;cribe it to his own People by a particular Command, it was purely the Peoples Crea|ture, the production of their own fancy, conceiv'd in wickedne&s;s, and brought forth in iniquity, an Idol &s;et up by them&s;elves to their own de|&s;truction, in imitation of their accur&s;ed Neighbours; and their Reward was no better than the conce&s;&s;ion of an impious Petition, which is one of God's heavie&s;t Judgments. <HI>Samuel</HI>'s words are acknowledg'd by all Interpreters, who were not malicious or mad, to be a di&s;&s;ua&s;ion from their wicked purpo&s;e; not a de&s;cription of what a King might ju&s;tly do by virtue of his Office, but what tho&s;e who &s;hould be &s;et up again&s;t God and his Law would do when they came to have the power in their hands: And I leave &s;uch as have the under&s;tandings of men, and are not aban|don'd by God, to judg what influence this ought to have upon other Na|tions, either as to obligation or imitation.</P>

<HEAD>  SECT. IV. No People can be oblig'd to &s;uffer from their Kings what they have not a right to do.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author's next work is to tell us, That <HI>the &s;cope of</HI> Samuel <HI>was to teach the People a dutiful obedience to their King, even in the things that they think mi&s;chievous or inconvenient: For by telling them what the King would do, he indeed in&s;tructs them what a Subject mu&s;t &s;uffer: Yet not &s;o that it is right for Kings to do injury, but it is right for them to go unpuni&s;h'd by the People if they do it; &s;o that in this point it is all one whether</HI> Samuel <HI>de&s;cribe a King or a Tyrant.</HI> This is hard, but the Conclu&s;ion is grounded upon nothing. There is no relation between a Prediction that a thing &s;hall be attempted or done to me, and a Precept that I &s;hall not defend my &s;elf, or puni&s;h the per&s;on that attempts or dos it. If a Prophet &s;hould &s;ay that a Thief lay in the way to kill me, it might rea&s;onably per&s;uade me not to go, or to go in &s;uch a manner as to be able to defend my &s;elf; but can no way oblige me to &s;ubmit to the violence that &s;hall be offer'd, or my Friends and Children not to avenge my death if I fall: much le&s;s can other men be depriv'd of the natural right of defending them&s;elves, by my imprudence or ob&s;tinacy in not taking the warning given, whereby I might have pre&s;erv'd my life. For every man has a right of re&s;i&s;ting &s;ome way or other that which ought not to be done to him; and tho human Laws do not in all ca&s;es make men Judges and A|vengers of the Injurys offer'd to them, I think there is none that dos not ju&s;tify the man who kills another that offers violence to him, if it appears that the way pre&s;crib'd by the Law for the pre&s;ervation of the Innocent cannot be taken. This is not only true in the ca&s;e of outrageous attempts to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nate or rob on the high way, but in divers others of le&s;s moment. I knew a man who being appointed to keep his Ma&s;ter's Park, kill'd three men in one night that came to de&s;troy his Deer; and putting him&s;elf into the hands of the Magi&s;trate, and confe&s;&s;ing the Fact both in matter and manner, he was at the publick A&s;&s;izes not only acquitted, but commended for having done his duty; and this in a time when 'tis well known Ju&s;tice was &s;everely admini&s;ter'd, and little favor expected by him or his Ma|&s;ter. Nay, all Laws mu&s;t fall, human Societys that &s;ub&s;i&s;t by them be di&s;&s;olv'd, and all innocent per&s;ons be expos'd to the violence of the mo&s;t wicked, if men might not ju&s;tly defend them&s;elves again&s;t inju&s;tice by their own natural right, when the ways pre&s;crib'd by publick Autho|rity cannot be taken.</P>
<P>Our Author may perhaps &s;ay, this is true in all except the King: And I de&s;ire to know why, if it be true in all except the King, it &s;hould not be true in relation to him? Is it po&s;&s;ible that he who is in&s;tituted for the obtaining of Ju&s;tice, &s;hould claim the liberty of doing Inju&s;tice as a Privi|lege? Were it not better for a people to be without Law, than that a Power &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Law to commit all manner of violen|ces with impunity? Did not <HI>David</HI> re&s;i&s;t tho&s;e of <HI>Saul?</HI> Did he not make him&s;elf head of the Tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> when they revolted again&s;t his Son, and afterwards of the ten Tribes that rejected his Po&s;te|rity?
<PB N="243" REF="249">
Did not the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> &s;tone <HI>Adoram</HI> who collected the Taxes, revolt   from the Hou&s;e of <HI>David,</HI> &s;et up <HI>Jeroboam;</HI> and did not the Prophet &s;ay it was from the Lord? If it was from the Lord, was it not good? If it was good then, is it not &s;o for ever? Did good proceed from one root then, and from another now? If God had aveng'd the Blood of <HI>Naboth</HI> by fire from Heaven, and de&s;troy'd the Hou&s;e of <HI>Ahab,</HI> as he did the two Cap|tains and their men who were &s;ent to apprehend <HI>Elijah,</HI> it might be &s;aid, he re&s;erv'd that vengeance to him&s;elf; but he did it by the Sword of <HI>Jehu</HI> and the Army (which was the People who had &s;et him up) for an Ex|ample to others.</P>
<P>But 'tis good to examin what this <HI>dutiful Obedience</HI> is that our Author mentions. Men u&s;ually owe no more than they receive. 'Tis hard to know what the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> ow'd to <HI>Saul, David, Jeroboam, Ahab,</HI> or any other King, whether good or bad, till they were made Kings: And the Actof the People by which &s;o great a dignity was confer'd, &s;eems to have laid a duty upon them, who did receive more than they had to give: &s;o that &s;omething mu&s;t be due from them, unle&s;s it were releas'd by vir|tue of a Covenant or Promi&s;e made; and none could accrue to them from the people afterwards, unle&s;s from the merit of the per&s;on in rightly exe|cuting his Office. If a Covenant or Promi&s;e be pretended, the nature and extent of the Obligation can only be known by the contents expre&s;t, or the true intention of it. If there be a general form of Covenant &s;et and agreed upon, to which all Nations mu&s;t &s;ubmit, it were good to know where it may be found, and by who&s;e Authority it is e&s;tabli&s;h'd, and then we may examin the &s;en&s;e of it. If no &s;uch do appear, we may ra|tionally look upon tho&s;e to be Impo&s;tors, who &s;hould go about from thence to derive a right: And as that which dos not appear, is as if it were not, we may ju&s;tly conclude there is no other, or none that can have any effect, but &s;uch as have bin made by particular Nations with their Princes; which can be of no force or obligation to others, nor to them&s;elves, any farther than according to the true intention of tho&s;e that made them. There is no &s;uch thing therefore as a dutiful obedience, or duty of being obedient, incumbent upon all Nations by virtue of any Co|venant; nor upon any particular Nation, unle&s;s it be expre&s;t by a Cove|nant: and whoever pretends to a right of taking our Sons and Daugh|ters, Lands or Goods, or to go unpuni&s;h'd if he do, mu&s;t &s;how that the&s;e things are expre&s;t or intended by the Covenant.</P>
<P>But tho Nations for the mo&s;t part owe nothing to Kings till they are Kings, and that it can hardly be conceiv'd, that any people did ever owe &s;o much to a man, as might not be fully repaid by the honor and advan|tages of &s;uch an advancement; yet 'tis po&s;&s;ible that when they are made Kings, they may by their good Government lay &s;uch Obligations upon their Subjects, as ought to be recompens'd by obedience and &s;ervice. There is no mortal Creature that de&s;erves &s;o well from mankind, as a wi&s;e, valiant, diligent and ju&s;t King, who as a Father cheri&s;hes his People; as a Shepherd feeds, defends, and is ready to lay down his life for his flock; who is a terror to evil doers, and a prai&s;e to tho&s;e that do well. This is a glorious Prerogative, and he who has it is happy. But before this can be adjudg'd to belong to all, it mu&s;t be prov'd that all have the Vertues that de&s;erve it; and he that exacts the dutiful Obedi|ence that ari&s;es from them, mu&s;t prove that they are in him. He that dos this, need not plead for impunity when he dos injurys; for if he do them, he is not the man we &s;peak of: Not being &s;o, he can have no title
<PB N="244" REF="250">
  to the duty by human In&s;titution or Covenant; nor by divine Law, &s;ince, as is already prov'd, God has neither e&s;tabli&s;h'd Kings over all Nations by Precept, nor recommended them by Example, in &s;etting them over his own People. He has not therefore done it at all; there is no &s;uch thing in nature; and Nations can owe nothing to Kings merely as Kings, but what they owe by the Contract made with them.</P>
<P>As the&s;e Contracts are made voluntarily, without any previous obli|gation, 'tis evident that men make them in con&s;ideration of their own good, and they can be of force no longer, than he with whom they are made perform his part in procuring it; and that if he turn the power which was given to him for the publick good, to the publick inconveni|ence and damage, he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily lo&s;e the benefit he was to receive by it. The word <HI>think</HI> is fooli&s;hly and affectedly put in by our Author; for tho&s;e matters are very often &s;o evident, that even the weake&s;t know them. No great &s;agacity is requir'd to under&s;tand that leud, &s;lothful, ignorant, fal&s;e, unju&s;t, covetous and cruel Princes bring inconveniences and mi&s;chiefs upon Nations; and many of them are &s;o evidently guilty of &s;ome or all the&s;e Vices, that no man can be mi&s;taken in imputing them; and the utmo&s;t Calamitys may rationally be expected from them, unle&s;s a Remedy be apply'd.</P>
<P>But, &s;ays he, <HI>Samuel</HI> by telling them <HI>what the King would do, in&s;tructs them what the Subjects mu&s;t &s;uffer, and that 'tis right he &s;hould go unpuni&s;h'd.</HI> But, by his favor, <HI>Samuel</HI> &s;ays no &s;uch thing; neither is it to be conclud|ed, that becau&s;e a King will do wickedly, he mu&s;t be &s;uffer'd, any more than a private man, who &s;hould take the &s;ame Re&s;olution. But he told them, that <HI>when they &s;hould cry to the Lord by rea&s;on of their King, he would not hear them.</HI> This was as much as to &s;ay, their ruin was una|voidable; and that, having put the power into the hands of tho&s;e, who in&s;tead of protecting would oppre&s;s them; and thereby having provok'd God again&s;t them, &s;o as he would not hearken to their cries, they could have no relief. But this was no &s;ecurity to the Authors of their Calamity. The Hou&s;es of <HI>Jeroboam, Baa&s;ha</HI> and <HI>Omri,</HI> e&s;cap'd not unpuni&s;h'd, tho the People did not thereby recover their Liberty. The Kings had intro|duc'd a Corruption that was incon&s;i&s;tent with it. But they who could not &s;ettle upon a right Foundation to prevent future mi&s;chiefs, could a|venge &s;uch as they had &s;uffer'd, upon the heads of tho&s;e who had caus'd 'em, and frequently did it mo&s;t &s;everely. The like be&s;el the <HI>Romans,</HI> when by the violence of Tyranny all good Order was overthrown, good Di&s;ci|plin extingui&s;h'd, and the People corrupted. Ill Princes could be cut in pieces, and mi&s;chiefs might be reveng'd, tho not prevented. But 'tis not &s;o every where, nor at all times; and nothing is more irrational, than from one or a few Examples to conclude a general nece&s;&s;ity of future E|vents. They alter according to Circum&s;tances: and as &s;ome Nations by de&s;troying Tyrants could not de&s;troy Tyranny; others in removing the Tyrant, have cut up Tyranny by the roots. This variety has bin &s;een in the &s;ame Nation at different times: The <HI>Romans</HI> recover'd their Liber|ty by expelling <HI>Tarquin;</HI> but remain'd Slaves notwith&s;tanding the &s;laugh|ter of <HI>Ce&s;ar.</HI> Whil&s;t the Body of the People was uncorrupted, they cur'd the Evil wrought by the Per&s;on, in taking him away. It was no hard matter to take the Regal Power that by one man had bin enjoy'd for life, and to place it in the hands of two annual Magi&s;trats, whil&s;t the Nobility and People were, according to the condition of that Age, &s;trong and ready to maintain it. But when the mi&s;chief had taken deeper root;
<PB N="245" REF="251">
when the be&s;t part of the people had peri&s;h'd in the Civil Wars; when   all their eminent men had fallen in battel, or by the Pro&s;criptions; when their Di&s;ciplin was lo&s;t, and Vertue aboli&s;h'd, the poor remains of the di&s;tre&s;t people were brought under the power of a mercenary Soldie|ry, and found no relief. When they kill'd one Tyrant, they often made room for a wor&s;e: It avail'd them nothing to cut off a rotten Branch, whil&s;t the accur&s;ed Root remain'd, and &s;ent forth new Sprouts of the &s;ame nature to their de&s;truction, Other generous Nations have bin &s;ub|du'd beyond a po&s;&s;ibility of recovery; and tho&s;e that are naturally ba&s;e, &s;lide into the like mi&s;ery without the impul&s;e of an exterior Power. They are Slaves by nature, and have neither the under&s;tanding nor courage that is requir'd for the con&s;titution and management of a Government within them&s;elves. They can no more &s;ub&s;i&s;t without a Ma&s;ter, than a flock without a Shepherd. They have no comprehen&s;ion of Liberty, and can neither de&s;ire the good they do not know, nor enjoy it if it were be&s;tow'd upon them. They bear all burdens; and whatever they &s;uffer, they have no other remedy or refuge, than in the mercy of their Lord. But &s;uch Nations as are naturally &s;trong, &s;tout, and of good under&s;tanding, who&s;e vigor remains unbroken, manners uncorrupted, reputation unble|mi&s;h'd, and increa&s;ing in numbers; who neither want men to make up &s;uch Armys as may defend 'em again&s;t foreign or dome&s;tick Enemys, nor Leaders to head them, do ordinarily &s;et limits to their patience. They know how to pre&s;erve their Liberty, or to vindicate the violation of it; and the more patient they have bin, the more inflexible they are when they re&s;olve to be &s;o no longer.

<HEAD>SECT. V. The Mi&s;chiefs &s;uffer'd from wicked Kings are &s;uch as render it both rea&s;onable and ju&s;t for all Nations that have Vertue and Power, to exert both in repelling them.</HEAD>
<P>IF our Author de&s;erve credit, we need not examin whether Nations have a right of re&s;i&s;ting, or a rea&s;onable hope of &s;ucceeding in their endeavours to prevent or avenge the Mi&s;chiefs that are fear'd or &s;uffer'd, for 'tis not worth their pains. <HI>The Inconveniences,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>and Mi&s;erys which are reckon'd up by</HI> Samuel, <HI>as belonging to Kingly Government, were not intolerable, but &s;uch as have bin and &s;till are born by the Subjects free con&s;ent from their Princes. Nay at this day, and in this Land, many Tenants by their Tenures are ty'd unto the &s;ame &s;ubjection, even unto &s;ubordinate and inferior Lords.</HI> He is an excellent Advocate for Kingly Government, that accounts Inconveniences and Mi&s;erys to be &s;ome of the e&s;&s;entials of it; which others e&s;teem to be only incidents. Tho many Princes are violent and wicked, yet &s;ome have bin gentle and ju&s;t: tho many have brought mi&s;ery upon Nations, &s;ome have bin beneficial to them: and they who are e&s;teem'd mo&s;t &s;evere again&s;t Monarchy, think the evils often
<PB N="246" REF="252">
  &s;uffer'd under that form of Government proceed from the Corruption of it, or deviation from the principle of its in&s;titution; and that they are rather to be imputed to the vices of the Per&s;on, than to the thing it &s;elf: but if our Author &s;peak truth, it is univer&s;ally and eternally naught, inconve|nience and mi&s;ery belong to it.</P>
<P>He thinks to mend this by &s;aying, they are not intolerable: but what is intolerable, if Inconveniences and Mi&s;erys be not? For what end can he think Governments to have bin e&s;tabli&s;h'd, unle&s;s to prevent or re|move Inconveniences and Mi&s;erys? or how can that be call'd a Govern|ment which dos not only permit, but cau&s;e them? What can incline Nations to &s;et up Governments? Is it that they may &s;uffer Inconveniences, and be brought to mi&s;ery? or if it be to enjoy happine&s;s, how can that &s;ub&s;i&s;t under a Government, which not by accident, deflection or cor|ruption, but by a nece&s;&s;ity inherent in it &s;elf, cau&s;es Inconveniences and Mi&s;erys? If it be pretended that no human Con&s;titution can be altoge|ther free from Inconveniences; I an&s;wer, that the be&s;t may to &s;ome degree fall into them, becau&s;e they may be corrupted: but evil and mi&s;ery can properly belong to none that is not evil in its own nature. If <HI>Samuel</HI> de|&s;erve credit, or may be thought to have &s;poken &s;en&s;e, he could not have enumerated the evils which he fore&s;aw the People &s;hould &s;uffer from their Kings, nor &s;ay that they &s;hould cry to the Lord by rea&s;on of them, unle&s;s they were in them&s;elves grievous, and in compari&s;on greater than what they had &s;uffer'd or known; &s;ince that would not have diverted them from their intention, but rather have confirm'd 'em in it. And I leave it to our Author to &s;how, why any People &s;hould for the plea&s;ure of one or a few men, erect or &s;uffer that Government which brings more of evil with it than any other.</P>
<P>Moreover, there is a great difference between that which Nations &s;ometimes &s;uffer under Kings, and that which they willingly &s;uffer; mo&s;t e&s;pecially if our Author's Maxim be receiv'd, That all Laws are the Mandates of Kings, and the Subjects Libertys and Privileges no more than their gracious Conce&s;&s;ions; for how patient &s;oever they are under the Evils they &s;uffer, it might rea&s;onably be believ'd they are &s;o becau&s;e they know not how to help it: And this is certainly the ca&s;e of too many places that are known to us. Whoever doubts of this, if he will not put him&s;elf to the trouble of going to <HI>Turky</HI> or <HI>Morocco,</HI> let him pa&s;s only into <HI>Normandy,</HI> and ask the naked, bare-footed and half-&s;tarv'd people whether they are willing to &s;uffer the Mi&s;erys under which they groan; and whether the magnificence of <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> and the pomp of their haugh|ty Ma&s;ter, do any way alleviate their Calamitys. If this al&s;o be a mat|ter of too much pains, the Wretches that come hither every day will in|form him, that it is not by their own con&s;ent they are depriv'd of all Honors and Offices in the Commonwealth, even of tho&s;e, which by a corrupt Cu&s;tom that had gain'd the force of a Law, they had dearly bought; prohibited to exerci&s;e any trade; expos'd to the utmo&s;t effects of fraud and violence, if they refu&s;e to adore their Ma&s;ter's Idols. They will tell him, that 'tis not willingly they leave their Lands and E&s;tates to &s;eek a &s;helter in the mo&s;t remote parts of the World; but becau&s;e they are under a force which they are notable to re&s;i&s;t; and becau&s;e one part of the Nation, which is enrich'd with the Spoils of the other, have fooli&s;hly contributed to lay a Yoke upon them which they cannot break.</P>
<P>To what he &s;ays concerning Tenures, I an&s;wer; No man in <HI>England</HI> ows any &s;ervice to his Lord, unle&s;s by virtue of a Contract made by him|&s;elf
<PB N="247" REF="253">
or his Predece&s;&s;ors, under which he holds the Land granted to him on   that condition by the Proprietor. There may be &s;omething of hard&s;hip, but nothing of inju&s;tice. 'Tis a voluntary act in the beginning and con|tinuance; and all men know that what is done to one who is willing <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Volenti non fit injuria.</NOTE>is no injury. He who did not like the Conditions, was not oblig'd to take the Land; and he might leave it, if afterwards he came to di&s;like them. If any man &s;ay, the like may be done by any one in the King|dom, I an&s;wer, That it is not always true; the Prote&s;tants now in <HI>France</HI> cannot without extreme hazard go out of that Country, tho they are contented to lo&s;e their E&s;tates. 'Tis accounted a Crime, for which they are condemn'd perpetually to the Gallys, and &s;uch as are aiding to them to grievous Fines. But before this be acknowledg'd to have any &s;imilitude or relation to our di&s;cour&s;e concerning Kings, it mu&s;t be prov'd, that the pre&s;ent King, or tho&s;e under whom he claims, is or were Pro|prietors of all the Lands in <HI>England,</HI> and granted the &s;everal parcels under the condition of &s;uffering patiently &s;uch Inconveniences and Mi&s;erys as are above-mention'd: or that they who did confer the Crown upon any of them, did al&s;o give a Propriety in the Land; which I do not find in any of the fifteen or &s;ixteen Titles that have bin &s;ince the coming in of the <HI>Normans:</HI> and if it was not done to the fir&s;t of every one, it cannot ac|crue to the others, unle&s;s by &s;ome new act to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, which will not ea&s;ily be produc'd.</P>
<P>It will be no le&s;s difficult to prove that any thing unworthy of Freemen is by any Tenures impos'd in <HI>England,</HI> unle&s;s it be the offering up of the Wives and Daughters of Tenants to the Lu&s;t of Abbots and Monks; and they are &s;o far from being willingly &s;uffer'd, that &s;ince the Dens and Nur|&s;erys of tho&s;e Bea&s;ts were aboli&s;h'd, no man that &s;ucceeds them has had impudence &s;ufficient to exact the performance: and tho the letter of the Law may favor them, the turpitude of the thing has extingui&s;h'd the u&s;age.</P>
<P>But even the Kings of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and <HI>Judah,</HI> who brought upon the Peo|ple tho&s;e evils that had bin foretold by <HI>Samuel,</HI> did not think they had a right to the Powers they exercis'd. If the Law had given a right to <HI>Ahab</HI> to take the be&s;t of their Vineyards, he might without ceremony have taken that of <HI>Naboth,</HI> and by the maje&s;tick power of an ab&s;olute Monarch, have cha&s;tis'd the churli&s;h Clown, who refus'd to &s;ell or change it for another: but for want of it, he was oblig'd to take a very different cour&s;e. If the lives of Subjects had in the like manner depended on the will of Kings, <HI>David</HI> might without &s;cruple have kill'd <HI>&V;riah,</HI> rather than to place him in the front of the Army that he might fall by his own courage. The malice and treachery of &s;uch Proceedings argues a defect of power; and he that acts in &s;uch an oblique manner, &s;hews that his actions are not warranted by the Law which is boldly executed in the face of the Sun. This &s;hews the interpretation put upon the words, <HI>Again&s;t thee only have I &s;inn'd,</HI> by Court-flatterers, to be fal&s;e. For if he had not &s;inn'd again&s;t <HI>Bath&s;heba</HI> whom he corrupted, <HI>&V;riah</HI> whom he caus'd to be kill'd, the People that he &s;candaliz'd, and the Law which he vio|lated, he had never endeavour'd to cover his guilt by &s;o vile a fraud. And as he did not thereby fly the &s;ight of God, but of men, 'tis evident that in that action he fear'd men more than God.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="254">
  If by the Examples of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and <HI>Judah,</HI> we may judg whether the Inconveniences and Mi&s;erys brought upon Nations by their Kings be to|lerable or intolerable, it will be enough to con&s;ider the madne&s;s of <HI>Saul</HI>'s cruelty towards his Subjects, and the &s;laughter brought upon them by the hand of the <HI>Phili&s;tins</HI> on Mount <HI>Gilboa,</HI> where he fell with the flower of all <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> the Civil Wars that happen'd in the time of <HI>David,</HI> and the Plague brought upon the People by his wickedne&s;s; the heavy burdens laid upon them by <HI>Solomon,</HI> and the Idolatry favor'd by him; the wret|ched folly of <HI>Rehoboam,</HI> and the defection of the ten Tribes caus'd by it; the Idolatry e&s;tabli&s;h'd by <HI>Jeroboam</HI> and the Kings of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> with that of many of tho&s;e of <HI>Judah</HI> al&s;o; the frequent Wars and unheard of Slaughters en&s;uing thereupon between the Tribes; the daily deva&s;tations of the Country by all &s;orts of Strangers; the murders of the Prophets; the abolition of God's Wor&s;hip; the de&s;olation of Towns and Provinces; the di&s;per&s;ion of the ten Tribes carry'd away into unknown Countrys; and in the end the abolition of both Kingdoms, with the captivity of the Tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> and the utter de&s;truction of the City. It cannot be &s;aid that the&s;e things were &s;uffer'd under Kings, and not from or by them; for the de&s;olation of the Citys, People and Country, is in many places of Scripture imputed to the Kings that taught <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to &s;in, as appears by <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 King. 14. 2 King. 21. 2 King. 20.</NOTE>what was denounc'd again&s;t <HI>Jeroboam, Jehu, Ahaz, Mana&s;&s;eh, Zedekiah,</HI> and others. Nay, the Captivity of <HI>Babylon</HI> with the evils en&s;uing, were fir&s;t announc'd to <HI>Hezekiah</HI> for his vanity; and <HI>Jo&s;iah</HI> by the like, brought a great &s;laughter upon him&s;elf and people.

<P>If it be pretended that God's People living under an extraordinary Di&s;|pen&s;ation can be no example to us, I de&s;ire other Hi&s;torys may be examin'd; for I confe&s;s I know no Nation &s;o great, happy and pro&s;pe|rous, nor any Power &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;h'd, that two or three ill Kings im|mediatly &s;ucceeding each other, have not bin able to de&s;troy and bring to &s;uch a condition, that it appear'd the Nations mu&s;t peri&s;h, unle&s;s the Senats, Diets, and other A&s;&s;emblys of State had put a &s;top to the mi&s;chief, by re&s;training or depo&s;ing them.

<HEAD>SECT. VI. 'Tis not good for &s;uch Nations as will have Kings, to &s;uffer them to be glorious, powerful, or abounding in Riches.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author having hitherto &s;poken of all Nations, as born under a nece&s;&s;ity of being &s;ubject to Ab&s;olute Monarchy, which he pretends to have bin &s;et up by the univer&s;al and indi&s;pen&s;ible Law of God and Nature, now &s;eems to leave to their di&s;cretion, whether they will have a King or not; but &s;ays, that tho&s;e <HI>who will have a King, are bound to allow him Royal Maintenance, by providing Revenues for the Crown; &s;ince it is for the Honor, Profit and Safety of the People, to have their King glorious, powerful, and abounding in Riches.</HI> If there be any thing of &s;en&s;e in this Clau&s;e, there is nothing of truth in the foundation or principle of his whole Book. For as the right and being of a Father is natural or inherent, and no ways depending upon the will of the Child; that of a King is &s;o al&s;o, if he be, and ought to enjoy the Rights belonging to the Father of the People: And 'tis not le&s;s ridiculous to &s;ay, <HI>tho&s;e who will have a King,</HI> than it would be to &s;ay, <HI>he that will have a Father;</HI> for every one mu&s;t have one whether he will or not. But if the King be a Father, as our Author from thence infers, that all Laws are from him, none can be impos'd upon him; and what&s;oever the Subject enjoys is by his con|ce&s;&s;ions; 'tis ab&s;urd to &s;peak of an Obligation lying upon the people to allow him Royal maintenance, by providing Revenues, &s;ince he has all in him&s;elf, and they have nothing that is not from him, and depending upon his Will. For this rea&s;on a worthy Gentleman of the Hou&s;e of Commons in the year 1640. de&s;ir'd that the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Judges, who in the Star-Chamber had given for their Opinion concerning Shipmony, <HI>That in ca&s;es of Nece&s;&s;ity the King might provide it by his own Authority, and that he was Judg of that Nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> might be fir&s;t examin'd, that they might know whether they had any thing to give, before they &s;hould &s;peak of giving. And as 'tis certain, that if the Sentence of tho&s;e perjur'd Wret|ches had &s;tood, the Subjects of <HI>England</HI> by con&s;equence would have bin &s;ound to have nothing to give; 'tis no le&s;s &s;ure, that if our Author's prin|ciple concerning the Paternal and Ab&s;olute Power of Kings be true, it will by a more compendious way appear, that it is not left to the choice of any Nation, whether they will have a King or not; for they mu&s;t have him, and can have nothing to allow him, but mu&s;t receive all from him.</P>
<P>But if tho&s;e only who <HI>will have a King,</HI> are bound to have one, and to allow this <HI>Royal maintenance,</HI> &s;uch as will not have a King, are by one and the &s;ame act deliver'd from the nece&s;&s;ity of having one, and from provid|ing Maintenance for him: which utterly overthrows the magnificent Fa|brick of Paternal Monarchy; and the Kings who were lately repre&s;ented by our Author, plac'd on the Throne by God and Nature, and endow'd with an ab&s;olute Power over all, appear to be purely the Creatures of the People, and to have nothing but what is receiv'd from them.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="256">
  From hence it may be rationally infer'd, that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Qui dat e&s;&s;e, dat modum e&s;&s;e.</NOTE>he who makes a thing to be, makes it to be only what he plea&s;es. This mu&s;t hold in relation to Kings as well as other Magi&s;trats; and as they who made Con&s;uls, Dictators, and Military Tribuns, gave them only &s;uch Power, and for &s;uch a time as be&s;t pleas'd them&s;elves, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould not have the &s;ame right in relation to Kings, in making them what they plea&s;e, as well as not to make them unle&s;s they plea&s;e; except there be a Charm belonging to the Name, or the Letters that compo&s;e it; which cannot be|long to all Nations, for they are different in every one according to the &s;everal Languages.</P>
<P>But, &s;ays our Author, 'tis <HI>for the Honor, Profit, and Safety of the Peo|ple that the King &s;hould be glorious, powerful, and abounding in Riches.</HI> There is therefore no obligation upon them, and they are to judg whether it be &s;o or not. The Scripture &s;ays plainly the contrary: <HI>He &s;hall not mul|tiply Silver and Gold, Wives and Hor&s;es; he &s;hall not lift up his Heart above his Brethren.</HI> He &s;hall not therefore be glorious, powerful, or abounding in Riches. Rea&s;on and Experience teach us the &s;ame thing: If tho&s;e Nations that have bin proud, luxurious and vicious, have de&s;ir'd by Pomp and Riches to foment the Vices of their Princes, thereby to cheri&s;h their own; &s;uch as have excel'd in Vertue and good Di&s;ciplin have abhor'd it, and except the immediate exerci&s;e of their Office, have kept their &s;upreme Magi&s;trats to a manner of living little different from that of private men: and it had bin impo&s;&s;ible to maintain that frugality, in which the integri|ty of their manners did chiefly con&s;i&s;t, if they had &s;et up an Example directly contrary to it, in him who was to be an Example to others; or to provide for their own &s;afety, if they had overthrown that integrity of manners by which it could only be obtain'd and pre&s;erv'd. There is a nece&s;&s;ity incumbent upon every Nation that lives in the like Principle, to put a &s;top to the entrance of tho&s;e Vices that ari&s;e from the &s;uperfluity of Riches, by keeping their Kings in that hone&s;t Poverty, which is the Mother and Nur&s;e of Mode&s;ty, Sobriety, and all manner of Vertue: And no man can deny this to be well done, unle&s;s he will affirm that Pride, Luxury and Vice is more profitable to a Nation than the Vertues that are upheld by frugality.</P>
<P>There is another rea&s;on of no le&s;s importance to tho&s;e Nations, who tho they think fit to have Kings, yet de&s;ire to pre&s;erve their Liberty, which obliges them to &s;et limits to the Glory, Power and Riches of their Kings; and that is, That they can no otherwi&s;e be kept within the Rules of the Law. Men are naturally propen&s;e to corruption; and if he who&s;e Will and Intere&s;t it is to corrupt them, be furni&s;h'd with the means, he will never fail to do it. Power, Honors, Riches, and the Plea&s;ures that attend them, are the baits by which men are drawn to prefer a per&s;onal Intere&s;t before the publick Good; and the number of tho&s;e who covet them is &s;o great, that he who abounds in them will be able to gain &s;o many to his &s;ervice as &s;hall be &s;ufficient to &s;ubdue the re&s;t. 'Tis hard to find a Tyranny in the world that has not bin introduc'd this way: for no man by his own &s;trength could ever &s;ubdue a multitude; none could ever bring many to be &s;ub&s;ervient to his ill de&s;igns, but by the rewards they receiv'd or hop'd. By this means <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> accompli&s;h'd his work, and over|threw the Liberty of his Country, and with it all that was then good
<PB N="251" REF="257">
in the world. They who were corrupted in their minds, de&s;ir'd to put   all the Power and Riches into his hands, that he might di&s;tribute them to &s;uch as &s;erv'd him. And he who was nothing le&s;s than covetous in his own nature, de&s;ir'd Riches, that he might gain Followers; and by the plunder of <HI>Gaul</HI> he corrupted tho&s;e that betray'd <HI>Rome</HI> to him. And tho I do not delight to &s;peak of the Affairs of our own time, I de&s;ire tho&s;e who know the pre&s;ent State of <HI>France</HI> to tell me, whether it were po&s;&s;ible for the King to keep that Nation under &s;ervitude, if a va&s;t Revenue did not enable him to gain &s;o many to his particular &s;ervice as are &s;ufficient to keep the re&s;t in &s;ubjection: and if this be not enough, let them con&s;ider whether all the dangers that now threaten us at home, do not proceed from the madne&s;s of tho&s;e who gave &s;uch a Revenue, as is utterly un|proportionable to the Riches of the Nation, un&s;utable to the mode&s;t be|haviour expected from our Kings, and which in time will render Parlia|ments unnece&s;&s;ary to them.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the poverty and &s;implicity of the <HI>Spartan</HI> Kings was no le&s;s &s;afe and profitable to the People than truly glorious to them. <HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI> deny'd that <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> was greater than he, unle&s;s he were more temperate or more valiant; and he made good his words &s;o well, that without any other a&s;&s;i&s;tance than what his Wi&s;dom and Valor af|forded, he &s;truck &s;uch a terror into that great, rich, powerful and ab&s;o|lute Monarch, that he did not think him&s;elf &s;afe in <HI>Babylon</HI> or <HI>Ecbatane,</HI> till the poor <HI>Spartan</HI> was, by a Captain of as great valor, and greater poverty, oblig'd to return from <HI>A&s;ia</HI> to the defence of his own Country. This was not peculiar to the &s;evere <HI>Laconic</HI> Di&s;ciplin. When the <HI>Roman</HI> Kings were expel'd, a few Carts were prepar'd to tran&s;port their goods: and their Lands, which were con&s;ecrated to <HI>Mars,</HI> and now go under the name of <HI>Campus Martius,</HI> hardly contain ten Acres of ground. Nay the Kings of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> who led &s;uch va&s;t Armys into the field (that is, were follow'd by all the people who were able to bear Arms) &s;eem to have po&s;|&s;e&s;t little. <HI>Ahab,</HI> one of the mo&s;t powerful, was &s;o fond of <HI>Naboth</HI>'s Vineyard (which being the Inheritance of his Fathers, according to their equal divi&s;ion of Lands, could not be above two Acres) that he grew &s;ick when it was refus'd.</P>
<P>But if an allowance is to be made to every King, it mu&s;t be either ac|cording to a univer&s;al Rule or Standard, or mu&s;t depend upon the Judgment of Nations. If the fir&s;t, they who have it, may do well to produce it; if the other, every Nation proceeding according to the mea&s;ure of their own di&s;cretion, is free from blame.</P>
<P>It may al&s;o be worth ob&s;ervation, whether the Revenue given to a King be in &s;uch manner committed to his care, that he is oblig'd to em|ploy it for the publick Service without the power of Alienation; or whe|ther it be granted as a Propriety, to be &s;pent as he thinks fit. When &s;ome of the antient Jews and Chri&s;tians &s;crupled the paiment of Tribute to the Emperors, the rea&s;ons alledg'd to per&s;uade them to a compliance, &s;eem to be grounded upon a &s;uppo&s;ition of the fir&s;t: for, &s;aid they, the defence of the State lies upon them, which cannot be perform'd without Armys and Gari&s;ons; the&s;e cannot be maintain'd without pay, nor mony rais'd to pay them without Tributes and Cu&s;toms. This carrys a face of rea&s;on with it, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e Countrys which are perpetually or fre|quently &s;ubject to Inva&s;ions; but this will not content our Author.

<HEAD>SECT. VII. When the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> ask'd for &s;uch a King as the Nations about them had, they ask'd for a Tyrant, tho they did not call him &s;o.</HEAD>
<P><HI>NOW that</HI> Saul <HI>was no Tyrant,</HI> &s;ays our Author, <HI>note, that the people ask'd a King as all Nations had: God an&s;wers, and bids</HI> Samuel <HI>to hear the voice of the People in all things which they &s;pake, and appoint them a King. They did not ask a Tyrant; and to give them a Tyrant when they ask'd a King, had not bin to hear their voice in all things, but rather when they ask'd an Egg to have given them a Scorpion; unle&s;s we will &s;ay that all Nations had Tyrants.</HI> But before he drew &s;uch a Conclu&s;ion, he &s;hould have ob&s;erv'd, that God did not give them a Scorpion when they ask'd an Egg, but told them that was a Scorpion which they call'd an Egg: They would have a King to judg them, to go out before them, and to fight their Battels; but God in effect told them, he would overthrow all Ju&s;tice,
<PB N="253" REF="259">
and turn the Power that was given him, to the ruin of them and their Po|&s;terity.   But &s;ince they would have it &s;o, he commanded <HI>Samuel</HI> to hear|ken to their Voice, and for the puni&s;hment of their &s;in and folly to give them &s;uch a King as they ask'd, that is, one who would turn to his own profit and their mi&s;ery, the Power with which he &s;hould be entru&s;ted; and this truly denominates a Tyrant. <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> makes no other di&s;tinction between a King and a Tyrant, than that <HI>the King governs for the good of the People, the Tyrant for his own plea&s;ure or profit:</HI> and they who ask'd &s;uch a one, ask'd a Tyrant, tho they call'd him a King. This is all could be done in their Language: for as they who are skill'd in the Oriental Tongues a&s;&s;ure me, there is no name for a Tyrant in any of them, or any other way of expre&s;&s;ing the thing than by circumlocution, and adding proud, in&s;olent, lu&s;tful, cruel, violent, or the like Epithets, to the word Lord, or King. They did in effect ask a Tyrant: They would not have &s;uch a King as God had ordain'd, but &s;uch a one as the Nations had. Not that all Nations had Tyrants; but tho&s;e who were round about them, of whom they had knowledg, and which in their manner of &s;peaking went under the name of all, were ble&s;t with &s;uch Ma&s;ters. This way of expre&s;&s;ion was us'd by <HI>Lot</HI>'s Daughters, who &s;aid, There was not a man in all the earth to come in to them; becau&s;e there was none in the neighborhood with whom it was thought fit they &s;hould accompany. Now that the Ea&s;tern Nations were then, and are &s;till under the Govern|ment of tho&s;e which all free People call Tyrants, is evident to all men. God therefore in giving them a Tyrant, or rather a Government that would turn into Tyranny, gave them what they ask'd under another name; and without any blemi&s;h to the Mercy promis'd to their Fathers, &s;uffer'd them to bear the penalty of their wickedne&s;s and folly in rejecting him that he &s;hould not reign over them.</P>
<P>But tho the name of Tyrant was unknown to them, yet in <HI>Greece,</HI> from whence the word comes, it &s;ignify'd no more than one who go|vern'd according to his own will, di&s;tingui&s;h'd from Kings that govern'd by Law; and was not taken in an ill &s;en&s;e, till tho&s;e who had bin ad|vanc'd for their Ju&s;tice, Wi&s;dom and Valor, or their De&s;cendents, were found to depart from the ends of their In&s;titution, and to turn that Power to the oppre&s;&s;ion of the people, which had bin given for their protection. But by the&s;e means it grew odious, and that kind of Government came to be thought only tolerable by the ba&s;e&s;t of men; and tho&s;e who de&s;troy'd it, were in all places e&s;teem'd to be the be&s;t.</P>
<P>If Monarchy had bin univer&s;ally evil, God had not in the 17<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Deu|teronomy</HI> given leave to the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> to &s;et up a King; and if that kind of King had bin ask'd, he had not bin di&s;pleas'd: and they could not have bin &s;aid to reject God, if they had not ask'd that which was evil; for nothing that is good is contrary, or incon&s;i&s;tent with a peoples obedi|ence to him. The Monarchy they ask'd was di&s;plea&s;ing to God, it was therefore evil. But a Tyrant is no more than an evil or corrupted Mo|narch: The King therefore that they demanded was a Tyrant: God in granting one who would prove a Tyrant, gave them what they ask'd; and that they might know what they did, and what he would be, he told 'em they rejected him, and &s;hould cry by rea&s;on of the King they de&s;ir'd.</P>
<P>This denotes him to be a Tyrant: for as the Government of a King ought to be gentle and ea&s;y, tending to the good of the people, re&s;embling the tender care of a Father to his Family; if he who is &s;et up to be a
<PB N="254" REF="260">
  King, and to be like to that Father, dos lay a heavy Yoke upon the peo|ple, and u&s;e them as Slaves and not as Children, he mu&s;t renounce all re&s;emblance of a Father, and be accounted an Enemy.</P>
<P><HI>But,</HI> &s;ays our Author, <HI>whereas the peoples crying argues &s;ome tyrannical oppre&s;&s;ion, we may remember that the peoples Crys are not always an Argument of their living under a Tyrant. No man will &s;ay</HI> Solomon <HI>was a Tyrant, yet all the Congregation complain'd that</HI> Solomon <HI>made their Yoke grievous.</HI> 'Tis &s;trange, that when Children, nay when Whelps cry, it &s;hould be accounted a mark that they are troubled, and that the Cry of the whole People &s;hould be none: Or that the Government which is erected for their ea&s;e, &s;hould not be e&s;teem'd tyrannical if it prove grievous to tho&s;e it &s;hould relieve. But as I know no example of a People that did generally complain without cau&s;e, our Adver&s;arys mu&s;t alledg &s;ome other than that of <HI>Solomon,</HI> before I believe it of any. We are to &s;peak reverently of him: He was excellent in Wi&s;dom; he built the Temple, and God ap|pear'd twice to him: But it mu&s;t be confe&s;t, that during a great part of his life he acted directly contrary to the Law given by God to Kings, and that his ways were evil and oppre&s;&s;ive to the people, if tho&s;e of God were good. Kings were forbidden to multiply Hor&s;es, Wives, Silver and Gold: But he brought together more Silver and Gold, and provided more Hor&s;es, Wives and Concubines than any man is known to have had: And tho he did not actually return to <HI>Egypt,</HI> yet he introduc'd their abominable Idolatry, and &s;o far rais'd his heart above his Brethren, that he made them &s;ub&s;ervient to his Pomp and Glory. The People might pro|bably be pleas'd with a great part of this; but when the Yoke became grievous, and his fooli&s;h Son would not render it more ea&s;y, they threw it off; and the thing being from the Lord, it was good, unle&s;s he be evil.</P>
<P>But as ju&s;t Governments are e&s;tabli&s;h'd for the good of the governed, and the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> de&s;ir'd a King, that it might be well with them, not with him who was not yet known to them; that which exalts one to the preju|dice of tho&s;e that made him, mu&s;t always be evil, and the People that &s;uffers the prejudice mu&s;t needs know it better than any other. He that denies this, may think the &s;tate of <HI>France</HI> might have bin be&s;t known from <HI>Bulion</HI> the late Trea&s;urer, who finding <HI>Lewis</HI> the Thirteenth to be troubled at the peoples mi&s;ery, told him they were too happy, &s;ince they were not reduc'd to eat gra&s;s. But if words are to be under&s;tood as they are ordinarily us'd, and we have no other than that of <HI>Tyranny</HI> to expre&s;s a Monarchy that is either evil in the in&s;titution, or fallen into corruption, we may ju&s;tly call that <HI>Tyranny</HI> which the Scripture calls a <HI>grievous Yoke,</HI> and which neither the old nor the new Coun&s;ellors of <HI>Rehoboam</HI> could deny to be &s;o; for tho the fir&s;t advis'd him to promi&s;e amendment, and the others to do wor&s;e, yet all agreed that what the people &s;aid was true.</P>
<P>This Yoke is always odious to &s;uch as are not by natural &s;tupidity and ba&s;ene&s;s fitted for it; but tho&s;e who are &s;o, never complain. An A&s;s will bear a multitude of blows patiently, but the lea&s;t of them drives a Lion into rage. He that &s;aid, the rod is made for the back of fools, con|fe&s;t that oppre&s;&s;ion will make a wi&s;e man mad. And the mo&s;t unnatu|ral of all oppre&s;&s;ions is to u&s;e Lions like A&s;&s;es, and to lay that Yoke upon a generous Nation, which only the ba&s;e&s;t can de&s;erve; and for want of a better word we call this Tyranny.</P>
<P>Our Author is not contented to vindicate <HI>Solomon</HI> only, but extends his Indulgence to <HI>Saul.</HI> His cu&s;tom is to patronize all that is dete&s;table, and no better te&s;timony could be given of it. <HI>It is true,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>Saul lo&s;t his</HI>
<PB N="255" REF="261">
<HI>Kingdom, but not for being too cruel or tyrannical to his Subjects, but for being too merciful to his Enemys.</HI> But he alledges no other rea&s;on, than that the &s;laughter of the Prie&s;ts is not blam'd; not ob&s;erving that the Writers of the Scripture in relating tho&s;e things that are known to be abominable by the Light of Nature, frequently &s;ay no more of them: And if this be not &s;o, <HI>Lot</HI>'s drunkenne&s;s and ince&s;t, <HI>Reuben</HI>'s pollution of his Fa|ther's bed, <HI>Abimelech</HI>'s &s;laughter of his &s;eventy Brothers, and many of the mo&s;t wicked Acts that ever were committed, may pa&s;s for laudable and innocent. But if <HI>Saul</HI> were not to be blam'd for killing the Prie&s;ts, why was <HI>David</HI> blam'd for the death of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thou ha&s;t killed <HI>Uriah</HI> with the Sword of the Children of <HI>Ammon:</HI> Now therefore the Sword &s;hall never depart from thy Hou&s;e, <BIBL>2 Sam. 12.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>&V;riah?</HI> Why were the Dogs to lick the blood of <HI>Ahab</HI> and <HI>Jezebel,</HI> if they did nothing more than Kings might do without blame? Now if the &s;laughter of one man was &s;o &s;everely aveng'd upon the Authors and their Familys, none but &s;uch as <HI>Filmer</HI> can think that of &s;o many innocent men, with their Wives and Children, could e&s;cape unreprov'd or unpuni&s;h'd. But the whole &s;eries of the Hi&s;to|ry of <HI>Saul</HI> &s;hewing evidently that his Life and Reign were full of the mo&s;t violent cruelty and madne&s;s, we are to &s;eek no other rea&s;on for the ruin threaten'd and brought upon him and his Family. And as tho&s;e Princes who are mo&s;t barbarou&s;ly &s;avage again&s;t their own people, are u&s;ually mo&s;t gentle to the Enemys of their Country, he could not give a more certain te&s;timony of his hatred to tho&s;e he ought to have pro|tected, than by pre&s;erving tho&s;e Nations who were their mo&s;t irrecon|cilable Enemies. This is prov'd by rea&s;on as well as by experience; for every man knows he cannot bear the hatred of all mankind: Such as know they have Enemys abroad, endeavour to get Friends at home: Tho&s;e who command powerful Nations, and are belov'd by them, fear not to offend Strangers. But if they have render'd their own people Enemys to them, they cannot hope for help in a time of di&s;tre&s;s, nor &s;o much as a place of retreat or refuge, unle&s;s from &s;trangers, nor from them unle&s;s they de&s;erve it, by favoring them to the prejudice of their own Country. As no man can &s;erve two Ma&s;ters, no man can pur&s;ue two contrary Inte|re&s;ts. <HI>Mo&s;es, Jo&s;hua, Gideon</HI> and <HI>Samuel,</HI> were &s;evere to the <HI>Amorites, Midianites</HI> and <HI>Cananites,</HI> but mild and gentle to the <HI>Hebrews. Saul,</HI> who was cruel to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> &s;par'd the <HI>Amalekites,</HI> who&s;e pre&s;ervation was their de&s;truction: and whil&s;t he de&s;troy'd tho&s;e he &s;hould have &s;av'd, and &s;av'd tho&s;e that by a general and particular command of God he &s;hould have de&s;troy'd, he lo&s;t his ill govern'd Kingdom, and left an example to po&s;terity of the end that may be expected from pride, folly and tyranny.</P>
<P>The matter would not be much alter'd, if I &s;hould confe&s;s, that in the time of <HI>Saul</HI> all Nations were govern'd by Tyrants (tho it is not true, for <HI>Greece</HI> did then flouri&s;h in Liberty, and we have rea&s;on to be|lieve that other Nations did &s;o al&s;o) for tho they might not think of a good Government at the fir&s;t, nothing can oblige men to continue under one that is bad, when they di&s;cover the evils of it, and know how to mend it. They who tru&s;ted men that appear'd to have great Vertues, with &s;uch a power as might ea&s;ily be turn'd into Tyranny, might ju&s;tly retract, limit or aboli&s;h it, when they found it to be abus'd. And tho no condition had bin re&s;erv'd, the publick Good, which is the end of all <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Salus populi &s;uprema Lex.</NOTE>Government,

  had bin &s;ufficient to abrogate all that &s;hould tend to the contrary. As the malice of Men and their Inventions to do mi&s;chief increa&s;e daily, all would &s;oon be brought under the power of the wor&s;t, if care were not taken, and opportunitys embrac'd to find new ways of preventing it. He that &s;hould make War at this day as the be&s;t Commanders did two hundred years pa&s;t, would be beaten by the meane&s;t Soldier. The Pla|ces then accounted impregnable are now &s;lighted as indefen&s;ible; and if the Arts of defending were not improv'd as well as tho&s;e of a&s;&s;aulting, none would be able to hold out a day. Men were &s;ent into the World rude and ignorant; and if they might not have us'd their natural Facultys to find out that which is good for them&s;elves, all mu&s;t have bin condemn'd to continue in the ignorance of our fir&s;t Fathers, and to make no u&s;e of their under&s;tanding to the ends for which it was given.</P>
<P>The be&s;tial Barbarity in which many Nations, e&s;pecially of <HI>Africa, America</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> do now live, &s;hews what human Nature is, if it be not improv'd by Art and Di&s;ciplin: and if the fir&s;t errors, committed thro ignorance, might not be corrected, all would be oblig'd to continue in them; and for any thing I know, we mu&s;t return to the Religion, Manners and Policy that were found in our Country at <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI>'s landing. To affirm this is no le&s;s than to de&s;troy all that is commendable in the world, and to render the under&s;tanding given to men utterly u&s;ele&s;s. But if it be lawful for us by the u&s;e of that under&s;tanding to build Hou|&s;es, Ships and Forts better than our Ance&s;tors, to make &s;uch Arms as are mo&s;t fit for our defence, and to invent Printing, with an infinite number of other Arts beneficial to mankind, why have we not the &s;ame right in mat|ters of Government, upon which all others do almo&s;t ab&s;olutely depend? If men are not oblig'd to live in Caves and hollow Trees, to eat Acorns, and to go naked, why &s;hould they be for ever oblig'd to continue under the &s;ame form of Government that their Ance&s;tors happen'd to &s;et up in the time of their ignorance? Or if they were &s;o ignorant to &s;et up one that was not good enough for the age in which they liv'd, why &s;hould it not be alter'd, when tricks are found out to turn that to the prejudice of Na|tions, which was erected for their good? From whence &s;hould malice and wickedne&s;s gain a privilege of putting new Inventions to do mi&s;chief every day into practice? and who is it that &s;o far protects them, as to for|bid good and innocent men to find new ways al&s;o of defending them|&s;elves? If there be any that do this, they mu&s;t be &s;uch as live in the &s;ame principle; who whil&s;t they pretend to exerci&s;e Ju&s;tice, provide only for the indemnity of their own Crimes, and the advancement of unju&s;t de|&s;igns. They would have a right of attacking us with all the advantages of the Arms now in u&s;e, and the Arts which by the practice of &s;o many ages have bin wonderfully refin'd, whil&s;t we &s;hould be oblig'd to employ no others in our ju&s;t defence, than &s;uch as were known to our naked An|ce&s;tors when <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> invaded them, or to the <HI>Indians</HI> when they fell under the dominion of the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> This would be a compendious way of placing uncontrol'd Iniquity in all the Kingdoms of the World, and of overthrowing all that de&s;erves the name of Good by the introduction of &s;uch accur&s;ed Maxims. But if no man dares to acknowledg any &s;uch, except tho&s;e who&s;e acknowledgment is a di&s;credit, we ought not to &s;uffer them to be obliquely obtruded upon us, nor to think that God has &s;o far abandon'd us into the hands of our Enemys, as not to leave us the liber|ty of u&s;ing the &s;ame Arms in our defence as they do to offend and in|jure us.</P>

We &s;hall be told, that Prayers and Tears were the only Arms of the   fir&s;t Chri&s;tians, and that Chri&s;t commanded his Di&s;ciples to pray for tho&s;e that per&s;ecuted them. But be&s;ides that tho&s;e Precepts of the mo&s;t extreme lenity do ill &s;ute with the violent practices of tho&s;e who attempt to en&s;lave Nations, and who by alledging them do plainly &s;hew either that they do not extend to all Chri&s;tians, or that they them&s;elves are none whil&s;t they act contrary to them; they are to know, that tho&s;e Precepts were merely temporary, and directed to the Per&s;ons of the Apo&s;tles, who were arm'd only with the &s;word of the Spirit; that the Primitive Chri&s;ti|ans us'd Prayers and Tears only no longer than whil&s;t they had no other arms.

The fir&s;t of the <HI>Ce&s;ars</HI> had not bin &s;et up by them: The &s;eries of them had not bin conti|nu'd by their con&s;ent: They had not interrupted the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion by placing or di&s;placing &s;uch as they pleas'd: They had not brought in Strangers or Ba&s;tards, nor prefer'd the remote&s;t in blood before the neare&s;t: They had no part in making the Laws by which they were govern'd, nor had the <HI>Ce&s;ars</HI> &s;worn to them: They had no <HI>Great Charter,</HI> acknowledging their Libertys to be innate or inherent in them, confirm'd by immemorial Cu&s;|tom, and &s;trengthen'd by thirty acts of their own general A&s;&s;emblys, with the a&s;&s;ent of the <HI>Romans:</HI> The <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> who then govern'd came not to the power by their con&s;ent: The que&s;tion, <HI>Will ye have this man to reign?</HI> had never bin ask'd; but he being impos'd upon them, they were to &s;ubmit to the Laws by which he govern'd their Ma&s;ters. This can be nothing to us, who&s;e ca&s;e is in every re&s;pect mo&s;t unlike to theirs. We have no Dictatorian Power over us; and neither we nor our Fathers have render'd or ow'd obedience to any human Laws but our own, nor to any other Magi&s;tracy than what we have e&s;tabli&s;h'd. We have a King who reigns by Law. His power is from the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lex facit ut &s;it Rex. <BIBL>Bracton.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>Law that makes him King:</HI> and we can know only from thence what he is to command, and what we are oblig'd to obey. We know the power of the <HI>Ce&s;ars</HI> was u&s;urp'd, maintain'd and exercis'd with the mo&s;t dete&s;table violence, inju&s;tice and cruelty. But tho it had bin e&s;tabli&s;h'd by the con&s;ent of the <HI>Romans,</HI> from an opinion that it was good for them in that &s;tate of affairs, it were no|thing to us: and we could be no more oblig'd to follow their example in that, than to be govern'd by Con&s;uls, Tribuns, and <HI>Decemviri,</HI> or to con&s;titute &s;uch a Government as they &s;et up when they expel'd their Kings. Their Authority was as good at one time as at the other; or if a difference ought to be made, the preference is to be given to what they did when their Manners were mo&s;t pure, the People mo&s;t free, and when Vertue was mo&s;t flouri&s;hing among them. But if we are not oblig'd to &s;et up &s;uch a Magi&s;tracy as they had, 'tis ridiculous to think that &s;uch an obedience is due to one who is not in being as they paid to him that was. And if I &s;hould confe&s;s that <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> holding the Senat and People of <HI>Rome</HI> under the power of the Sword, impos'd what tribute he pleas'd upon the Provin|ces; and that the <HI>Jews,</HI> who had no part in the Government, were oblig'd to &s;ubmit to his will, our liberty of paying nothing, except what the Parliament appoints, and yielding obedience to no Laws but &s;uch as are made to be &s;o by their Authority, or by our own immemorial Cu&s;toms, could not be thereby infring'd. But we may ju&s;tly affirm, that the Tri|bute impos'd was not, as our Author infers, <HI>all their Coin,</HI> nor a con&s;ide|rable part of it, nor more than what was under&s;tood to go for the defray|ing of the publick Charges. Chri&s;t by asking who&s;e Image and Super|&s;cription was &s;tampt upon their Mony, and thereupon commanding them to give to <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> that which was <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI>'s, did not imply that all was his; but that <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI>'s Mony being current among&s;t them, it was a continual and evident te&s;timony, that they acknowledg'd them&s;elves to be under his juri&s;diction, and therefore could not refu&s;e to pay the Tribute laid upon them by the &s;ame Authority, as other Nations did.</P>
<P>It may al&s;o be ob&s;erv'd, that Chri&s;t did not &s;o much &s;ay this to deter|min the que&s;tions that might ari&s;e concerning <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI>'s Power; for he plain|ly

&s;ays, that was not his work; but to put the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> to &s;ilence who   tempted him. According to the opinion of the <HI>Jews,</HI> that the Me&s;&s;ias would re&s;tore the Kingdom of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> they thought his fir&s;t work would be to throw off the <HI>Roman</HI> Yoke; and not believing him to be the man, they would have brought him to avow the thing, that they might de&s;troy him. But as that was not his bu&s;ine&s;s, and that his time was not yet come, it was not nece&s;&s;ary to give them any other an&s;wer, than &s;uch as might di&s;appoint their purpo&s;e. This &s;hews that, without detracting from the honor due to <HI>Au&s;tin, Ambro&s;e,</HI> or <HI>Tertullian,</HI> I may ju&s;tly &s;ay, that the deci&s;ion of &s;uch que&s;tions as ari&s;e concerning our Government mu&s;t be decided by our Laws, and not by their Writings. They were excellent Men; but living in another time, under a very different Go|vernment, and applying them&s;elves to other matters, they had no know|ledg at all of tho&s;e that concern us. They knew what Government they were under, and thereupon judg'd what a broken and di&s;pers'd People ow'd to that which had given Law to the be&s;t part of the World before they were in being, under which they had bin educated, and which after a mo&s;t cruel per&s;ecution was become propitious to them. They knew that the Word of the Emperor was a Law to the Senat and People, who were under the power of that man that could get the be&s;t Army; but perhaps had never heard of &s;uch mix'd Governments as ours, tho about that time they began to appear in the world. And it might be as rea|&s;onably concluded, that there ought to be no rule in the Succe&s;&s;ion or Election of Princes, becau&s;e the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors were &s;et up by the vio|lence of the Soldiers, and for the mo&s;t part by the &s;laughter of him who was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Power, as that all other Princes mu&s;t be ab&s;olute when they have it, and do what they plea&s;e, till another more &s;trong and more happy may by the like means wre&s;t the &s;ame Power from them.</P>
<P>I am much mi&s;taken if this be not true; but without prejudice to our Cau&s;e, we may take that which they &s;ay, according to their true mean|ing, in the utmo&s;t extent.

If our Author will not acknowledg this, then no man was ever guilty of a more vile prevarication than he, who alledges tho&s;e words in favor of his Cau&s;e, which have their only &s;trength in Opinions that he thinks fal&s;e, and in the Authority of a man whom in that very thing he condemns; and mu&s;t do &s;o, or overthrow all that he endeavours to &s;upport. But <HI>Tertullian</HI>'s Opinions concerning the&s;e matters have no relation to our pre|&s;ent Que&s;tion. The de&s;ign of his Apology, and the Treati&s;e to <HI>Scapula</HI> almo&s;t upon the &s;ame &s;ubject, was to &s;how, that the Civil Magi&s;tracy which he comprehends under the name of <HI>Ce&s;ar,</HI> had nothing to do with matters of Religion; and that, as no man could be a Chri&s;tian who would undertake the work of a Magi&s;trate, they who were jealous the publick Offices might be taken out of their hands, had nothing to fear from Chri&s;tians who re&s;olv'd not to meddle with them. Whereas our que&s;tion is only, Whether that Magi&s;tratical Power, which by Law or U&s;urpation was then in <HI>Ce&s;ar,</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily in all times, and in all places, be in one man, or may be divided and balanc'd according to the Laws of every Country, concerning which he &s;ays nothing: Or whe|ther we, who do not renounce the u&s;e of the Civil or Military Sword, who have a part in the Government, and think it our duty to apply our &s;elves to publick Cares, &s;hould lay them a&s;ide becau&s;e the antient Chri&s;ti|ans every hour expecting death, did not trouble them&s;elves with them.</P>
<P>If <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI> after he was a Bi&s;hop, employ'd the ferocity of a Soldier, which he &s;till retain'd, rather in advancing the power of the Clergy, than the good of Mankind by re&s;training the rage of Tyrants, it can be no prejudice to our Cau&s;e, of which he had no cogni&s;ance.

before his Bapti&s;m, and &s;eems to have had no knowledg of the <HI>Gothick</HI>   Polity, that within a few years grew famous by the overthrow of the <HI>Roman</HI> Tyranny, and delivering the world from the Yoke which it could no longer bear. And if <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> might &s;ay, That <HI>the Emperor is &s;ubject to no Laws, becau&s;e he has a Power of making Laws;</HI> I may ju&s;tly &s;ay, that our Kings are &s;ubject to Laws, becau&s;e they can make no Law, and have no Power but what is given by the Laws. If this be not the ca&s;e, I de&s;ire to know who made the Laws, to which they and their Predece&s;&s;ors have &s;worn; and whether they can according to their own will abrogate tho&s;e antient Laws, by which they are made to be what they are, and by which we enjoy what we have; or whether they can make new Laws by their own Power? If no man but our Author have impudence enough to a&s;&s;ert any &s;uch thing; and if all the Kings we ever had, except <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, did renounce it, we may conclude that <HI>Au&s;tin</HI>'s words have no relation to our di&s;pute; and that 'twere to no purpo&s;e to examin, whether the Fathers mention any re&s;ervation of Power to the Laws of the Land, or to the People; it being as lawful for all Nations, if they think fit, to frame Governments different from tho&s;e that were then in being, as to build Ba&s;tions, Halfmoons, Hornworks, Ravelins or Counter&s;carps, or to make u&s;e of Muskets, Cannon, Mortars, Carabines or Pi&s;tols, which were unknown to them.</P>
<P>What <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ays of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Kings, dos as little concern us. We have already prov'd their Power not to have bin ab&s;olute, tho greater than that which the Law allows to ours. It might upon occa&s;ion be a prudent advice to private per&s;ons living under &s;uch Governments as were u&s;ual in the Ea&s;tern Countrys, <HI>to keep the King's Commandments, and not to &s;ay, What do&s;t thou? becau&s;e where the Word of a King is, there is Power, and all that he plea&s;eth he will do.</HI> But all the&s;e words are not his; and tho&s;e that are, mu&s;t not be taken in a general &s;en&s;e; for tho his Son was a King, yet in his words there was no power: He could not do what he pleas'd, nor hinder others from doing what they pleas'd: He would have added weight to the Yoke that lay upon the necks of the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> but he could not; and we do not find him to have bin ma&s;ter of much more than his own Tongue, to &s;peak as many fooli&s;h things as he pleas'd. In other things, whether he had to deal with his own people, or with &s;tran|gers, he was weak and impotent; and the wretches who flatter'd him in his follys, could be of no help to him. The like has befallen many o|thers: Tho&s;e who are wi&s;e, vertuous, valiant, ju&s;t, and lovers of their People, have and ought to have Power; but &s;uch as are leud, vicious, fooli&s;h, and haters of their People, ought to have none, and are often depriv'd of all. This was well known to <HI>Solomon,</HI> who &s;ays, That <HI>a wi&s;e Child is better than an old and fooli&s;h King that will not be advis'd.</HI> When <HI>Nabuchodono&s;or</HI> &s;et him&s;elf in the place of God, his Kingdom was taken from him, and he was driven from the &s;ociety of men to herd with bea&s;ts. There was Power for a time in the word of <HI>Nero:</HI> he murder'd many excellent men; but he was call'd to account, and the World aban|don'd the Mon&s;ter it had too long endur'd. He found none to defend him, nor any better help, when he de&s;ir'd to die, than the hand of a Slave. Be&s;ides, &s;ome Kings by their In&s;titution have little Power; &s;ome have bin depriv'd of what they had, for abu&s;ing, or rendring them&s;elves unworthy of it; and Hi&s;torys afford us innumerable examples of both &s;orts.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="270">
  But tho I &s;hould confe&s;s that there is always Power in the word of a King, it would be nothing to us who di&s;pute concerning Right, and have no regard to that Power which is void of it. A Thief or a Pyrat may have Power: but that avails him not, when, as often befel the <HI>Ce&s;ars,</HI> he meets with one who has more; and is always un&s;afe, &s;ince having no effect upon the Con&s;ciences of men, every one may de&s;troy him that can. And I leave it to Kings to con&s;ider how much they &s;tand oblig'd to tho&s;e, who placing their Rights upon the &s;ame foot, expo&s;e their Per&s;ons to the &s;ame dangers.</P>
<P>But if Kings de&s;ire that in their Word there &s;hould be power, let them take care that it be always accompany'd with Truth and Ju&s;tice. Let them &s;eek the good of their People, and the hands of all good men will be with them. Let them not exalt them&s;elves in&s;olently, and every one will de&s;ire to exalt them. Let them acknowledg them&s;elves to be the Servants of the Publick, and all men will be theirs. Let &s;uch as are mo&s;t addicted to them, talk no more of <HI>Ce&s;ars,</HI> nor the Tributes due to them. We have nothing to do with the name of <HI>Ce&s;ar.</HI> They who at this day live under it, reject the Prerogatives antiently u&s;urp'd by tho&s;e who had it, and are govern'd by no other Laws than their own. We know no Law to which we owe obedience, but that of God, and our &s;elves. <HI>A&s;ia|tick</HI> Slaves u&s;ually pay &s;uch Tributes as are impos'd upon them; and whil&s;t braver Nations lay under the <HI>Roman</HI> Tyranny, they were forc'd to &s;ubmit to the &s;ame burdens. But even tho&s;e Tributes were paid for maintaining Armys, Fleets and Gari&s;ons, without which the poor and abject life they led could not have bin pre&s;erv'd. We owe none but what we freely give. None is or can be impos'd upon us, unle&s;s by our &s;elves. We mea&s;ure our Grants according to our own Will, or the pre&s;ent occa|&s;ions, for our own &s;afety. Our Ance&s;tors were born free, and, as the be&s;t provi&s;ion they could make for us, they left us that Liberty intire, with the be&s;t Laws they could devi&s;e to defend it. 'Tis no way impair'd by the Opinions of the Fathers. The words of <HI>Solomon</HI> do rather confirm it. The happine&s;s of tho&s;e who enjoy the like, and the &s;hameful mi&s;ery under which they lie, who have &s;uffer'd them&s;elves to be forc'd or cheated out of it, may per&s;uade, and the ju&s;tice of the Cau&s;e encourage us to think no|thing too dear to be hazarded in the defence of it.</P>

<P>IF that which our Author calls Divinity did reach the things in di&s;pute between us, or that the Opinions of the Fathers which he alledges, related to them, he might have &s;par'd the pains of examining our Laws: for a municipal Sanction were of little force to confirm a perpetual and univer&s;al Law given by God to mankind, and of no value again&s;t it, &s;ince man cannot abrogate what God has in&s;tituted, nor one Nation free it &s;elf from a Law that is given to all. But having abus'd the Scriptures, and the Writings of the Fathers, (who&s;e Opinions are to be valu'd only &s;o far as they rightly interpret them) he &s;eems de&s;irous to try whether he can as well put a fal&s;e &s;en&s;e upon our Law. According to his cu&s;tom he

takes pieces of pa&s;&s;ages from good Books, and turns them directly again&s;t   the plain meaning of the Authors, expre&s;t in the whole &s;cope and de&s;ign of their Writings. To &s;how that he intends to &s;pare none, he is not a|&s;ham'd to cite <HI>Bracton,</HI> who of all our antient Law-writers is mo&s;t oppo|&s;ite to his Maxims. He liv'd, &s;ays he, in <HI>Henry</HI> the third's time, &s;ince Parliamenns were in&s;tituted: as if there had bin a time when <HI>England</HI> had wanted them; or that the e&s;tabli&s;hment of our Liberty had bin made by the <HI>Normans,</HI> who, if we will believe our Author, came in by force of Arms, and oppre&s;t us. But we have already prov'd the E&s;&s;ence of Par|liaments to be as antient as our Nation, and that there was no time in which there were not &s;uch Councils or A&s;&s;emblys of the People as had the power of the whole, and made or unmade &s;uch Laws as be&s;t pleas'd them&s;elves. We have indeed a <HI>French</HI> word from a People that came from <HI>France,</HI> but the Power was always in our &s;elves: and the <HI>Norman</HI> Kings were oblig'd to &s;wear they would govern according to the Laws that had bin made by tho&s;e A&s;&s;emblys. It imports little whether <HI>Bracton</HI> liv'd before or after they came among&s;t us. His words are, <HI>Omnes &s;ub eo, &amp; ip&s;e &s;ub nullo, &s;ed tantum &s;ub Deo; All are under him, and he under none but God only. If he offend, &s;ince no Writ can go out again&s;t him, their Remedy is by petitioning him to amend his Faults; which if he will not do, it is puni&s;hment enough for him to expect God as an avenger.

He gave the name of King to the &s;overeign Power of the Nation, as <HI>Jacob</HI> call'd that of his De&s;cendents The Scepter; which he &s;aid &s;hould not depart from <HI>Judah</HI> till <HI>Shiloh</HI> came, tho all men know that his Race did not reign the third part of that time over his own Tribe, nor full &s;our&s;core years over the whole Nation. The &s;ame man|ner of &s;peech is us'd in all parts of the world. <HI>Tertullian</HI> under the name of <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> comprehended all magi&s;tratical Power, and imputed to him the Acts of which in his per&s;on he never had any knowledg. The <HI>French</HI> &s;ay, their King is always pre&s;ent, <HI>&s;ur &s;on lit de ju&s;tice,</HI> in all the Sovereign Courts of the Kingdom, which are not ea&s;ily number'd; and that Max|im could have in it neither &s;en&s;e nor truth, if by it they meant a Man, who can be but in one place at one time, and is always comprehended within the Dimen&s;ions of his own Skin. The&s;e things could not be un|known to <HI>Bracton,</HI> the like being in u&s;e among&s;t us; and he thought it no offence &s;o far to follow the dictates of Rea&s;on prohibited by no Law, as to make a difference between the invi&s;ible and omnipre&s;ent King, who never dies, and the Per&s;on that wears the Crown, whom no man with|out the guilt of Trea&s;on may endeavour to kill &s;ince there is an Act of Parliament in the ca&s;e.

God can &s;ufficiently puni&s;h Thieves and Mur|derers: but the future Judgment, of which perhaps they have no belief, is not &s;ufficient to re&s;train them from committing more Crimes, nor to deter others from following their example. God was always able to pu|ni&s;h Murderers, but yet by his Law he commands man to &s;hed the blood of him who &s;hould &s;hed man's blood; and declares that the Land cannot be purg'd of the Guilt by any other means. He had Judgments in &s;tore for <HI>Jeroboam, Ahab,</HI> and tho&s;e that were like them; but yet he com|manded, that, according to that Law, their Hou&s;es &s;hould be de&s;troy'd from the earth.

<HEAD>  SECT. X. The words of St. <HI>Paul</HI> enjoining obedience to higher Powers, favor all &s;orts of Governments no le&s;s than Monarchy.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author's next quarrel is with St. <HI>Paul, who did not,</HI> at he &s;ays, <HI>in enjoining &s;ubjection to the higher Powers, &s;ignify the Laws of the Land, or mean the highe&s;t Powers, as well Ari&s;tocratical and Democratical as Regal, but a Monarch that carries the Sword,</HI> &amp;c. But what if there be no Monarch in the place? or what if he do not carry the Sword? Had the Apo&s;tle &s;poken in vain, if the liberty of the <HI>Romans</HI> had not bin overthrown by the fraud and violence of <HI>Ce&s;ar?</HI> Was no obedience to be exacted whil&s;t that people enjoy'd the benefit of their own Laws, and Vertue flouri&s;h'd under the moderate Government of a legal and ju&s;t Magi&s;tracy, e&s;tabli&s;h'd for the common good, by the common con&s;ent of all? Had God no Mini&s;ter among&s;t them till Law and Ju&s;tice was overthrown, the be&s;t part of the people de&s;troy'd by the fury of a cor|rupt mercenary Soldiery, and the world &s;ubdu'd under the Tyranny of the wor&s;t Mon&s;ters that it had ever produc'd? Are the&s;e the ways of e&s;tabli&s;hing God's Vicegerents, and will he patronize no Governors or Governments but &s;uch as the&s;e? Dos God uphold evil, and that only? If the world has bin hitherto mi&s;taken, in giving the name of evil to that which is good, and calling that good which is evil; I de&s;ire to know what can be call'd good among&s;t men, if the Government of the <HI>Romans,</HI> till they enter'd <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and were corrupted by the Luxury of both, do not de&s;erve that name? or what is to be e&s;teem'd evil, if the e&s;tabli&s;hment and exerci&s;e of the <HI>Ce&s;ars</HI> Power were not &s;o?

Was there no Sword in that Nation and their Magi&s;trats, who overthrew the King|doms of <HI>Armenia, Egypt, Numidia, Macedon,</HI> with many others, and whom none of the Monarchs were able to re&s;i&s;t?

Who is it that defends the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in &s;uch a manner, that the greate&s;t Monarchs with all their Swords have had no great rea&s;on to boa&s;t of any Advantages gain'd again&s;t them? at lea&s;t till we (whom they could not re&s;i&s;t when we had no Monarch, tho we have bin di&s;gracefully beaten by them &s;ince we had one) by making Leagues again&s;t them, and &s;owing divi&s;ions among&s;t them, in&s;tigated and a&s;&s;i&s;ted the greate&s;t Power now in the world to their de&s;truction and our own. But our Author is &s;o accu&s;tom'd to fraud, that he never cites a pa&s;&s;age of Scripture which he dos not abu&s;e or vitiate; and that he may do the &s;ame in this place, he leaves out the following words, <HI>For there is no power but of God,</HI> that he might intitle one &s;ort only to his protection. If therefore the People and popu|lar Magi&s;trats of <HI>Athens;</HI> the two Kings, <HI>Ephori</HI> and Senat of <HI>Sparta;</HI> the <HI>Sanhedrins</HI> among&s;t the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> the Con&s;uls, Tribuns, Pretors and

Senat of <HI>Rome;</HI> the Magi&s;trats of <HI>Holland, Switzerland</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> have   or had power, we may conclude that they al&s;o were ordain'd by God; and that according to the precept of the Apo&s;tle, the &s;ame obedience for the &s;ame rea&s;on is due to them as to any Monarch.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle farther explaining him&s;elf, and &s;hewing who may be accounted a Magi&s;trate, and what the duty of &s;uch a one is, informs us when we &s;hould fear, and on what account. <HI>Rulers,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>are not a terror to good works, but to the evil: Wilt thou then not be afraid of the Power? do that which is good, and thou &s;halt have prai&s;e of the &s;ame; for he is the Mini&s;ter of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.</HI> He therefore is only the Mini&s;ter of God, who is not a terror to good works, but to evil; who executes wrath upon tho&s;e that do evil, and is a prai&s;e to tho&s;e that do well. And he who dos well, ought not to be afraid of the power, for he &s;hall receive prai&s;e. Now if our Au|thor were alive, tho he was a man of a hard forehead, I would ask him, whether in his Con&s;cience he believ'd, that <HI>Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero,</HI> and the rabble of &s;ucceeding Mon&s;ters, were a prai&s;e to tho&s;e who did well, and a terror to tho&s;e who did ill; and not the contrary, a prai&s;e to the wor&s;t, and a terror to the be&s;t men of the world? or for what rea&s;on <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ob virtutes certi&s;&s;imum exitium.</NOTE><HI>Tacitus</HI> could &s;ay, that Vertue brought men who liv'd under 'em to certain de&s;truction, and recite &s;o many Examples of the brave and good, who were murder'd by them for being &s;o, unle&s;s they had endeavour'd to extingui&s;h all that was good, and to <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ip&s;am ex&s;cindere virtutem.</NOTE>tear up Vertue by the roots? Why did he call <HI>Domitian</HI> an <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Virtutibus infe&s;tum.</NOTE>Enemy to Vertue, if he was a terror only to tho&s;e that did evil? If the world has hitherto bin mi&s;led in the&s;e things, and given the name of Vertue to Vice, and of Vice to Vertue, then <HI>Germanicus, Valerius A&s;iaticus, Corbulo, Helvidius Pri&s;cus, Thra&s;eas, Soranus</HI> and others that re&s;embled them, who fell under the rage of tho&s;e Bea&s;ts, nay <HI>Paul</HI> him&s;elf and his Di&s;ciples were evil doers; and <HI>Macro, Narci&s;&s;us, Pallas, Vinnius, Laco</HI> and <HI>Tigellinus</HI> were vertuous and good men. If this be &s;o, we are beholden to <HI>Filmer</HI> for admoni&s;hing mankind of the error in which they had &s;o long continu'd. If not, tho&s;e who per&s;ecuted and murder'd them for their Vertues, were not a terror to &s;uch as did evil, and a prai&s;e to tho&s;e who did well. The wor&s;t men had no need to fear them; but the be&s;t had, becau&s;e they were the be&s;t. All Princes therefore that have power are not to be e&s;teem'd equally the Mini&s;ters of God. They that are &s;o, mu&s;t receive their dignity from a title that is not common to all, even from a ju&s;t employment of their power to the incouragement of Vertue, and to the di&s;couragement of Vice. He that pretends to the veneration and obedience due to the Mini&s;ters of God, mu&s;t by his actions manife&s;t that he is &s;o. And tho I am unwilling to advance a propo&s;ition that may &s;ound har&s;hly to tender ears, I am inclin'd to believe, that the &s;ame rule, which obliges us to yield obedience to the good Magi&s;trate who is the Mini&s;ter of God, and a&s;&s;ures us that in obeying him we obey God, dos equally oblige us not to obey tho&s;e who make them&s;elves the Mini&s;ters of the Devil, le&s;t in obeying them, we obey the Devil, who&s;e works they do.</P>
<P>That none but &s;uch as are wilfully ignorant may mi&s;take <HI>Paul</HI>'s mean|ing, <HI>Peter,</HI> who was directed by the &s;ame Spirit, &s;ays di&s;tinctly, <HI>Submit</HI>
<PB N="268" REF="276">
  <HI>your &s;elves to every Ordinance of man for the Lord's &s;ake.</HI> If therefore there be &s;everal Ordinances of men tending to the &s;ame end, that is, the obtaining of Ju&s;tice, by being a terror to&punc; the evil and a prai&s;e to the good, the like obedience is for con&s;cience &s;ake enjoin'd to all, and upon the &s;ame condition. But as no man dares to &s;ay, that <HI>Athens</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia, Carthage</HI> and <HI>Egypt, Switzerland</HI> and <HI>France, Venice</HI> and <HI>Turky</HI> were and are under the &s;ame Government; the &s;ame obedience is due to the Ma|gi&s;trate in every one of tho&s;e places, and all others on the &s;ame account, whil&s;t they continue to be the Mini&s;ters of God.</P>
<P>If our Author &s;ay, that <HI>Peter</HI> cannot comprehend Kings under the name of human Ordinances, &s;ince <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays they are the Ordinance of God, I may as well &s;ay that <HI>Paul</HI> cannot call that the Ordinance of God, which <HI>Peter</HI> calls the ordinance of man. But as it was &s;aid of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Samuel,</HI> that they who &s;poke by the &s;ame Spirit could not contradict each other, <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> being full of Wi&s;dom and Sanctity, and in&s;pir'd by the &s;ame Spirit, mu&s;t needs &s;ay the &s;ame thing; and <HI>Grotius</HI> &s;hews that they perfectly agree, tho the one calls Kings, Rulers and Governors, the Ordinance of Man, and the other the Ordinance of God; ina&s;much as God having from the beginning ordain'd that men &s;hould not live like Wolves in woods, every man by him&s;elf, but together in Civil Societys, left to every one a liberty of joining with that Society which be&s;t pleas'd him, and to every Society to create &s;uch Magi&s;trats, and frame &s;uch Laws as &s;hould &s;eem mo&s;t conducing to their own good, according to the mea&s;ure of light and rea&s;on they might have. And every Magi&s;tracy &s;o in&s;tituted might rightly be call'd the Ordinance of Man who was the In&s;tituter, and the Ordinance of God according to which it was in&s;tituted; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quia &s;alubrem hominum Con&s;titutionem Deus probavit &amp; &s;auxie. <BIBL>De Jur. Bel. &amp; Pac.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>becau&s;e,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>God approv'd and ratify'd the &s;alutary Con&s;titutions of Government made by men.</HI></P>
<P>But, &s;ays our Author, <HI>Peter</HI> expounds his own words of the human Ordinance to be the King, who is the <HI>Lex loquens:</HI> but he &s;ays no &s;uch thing, and I do not find that any &s;uch thought ever enter'd into the Apo&s;tle's mind. The words are often found in the works of <HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> but apply'd only to &s;uch a man as is a King by nature, who is endow'd with all the vertues that tend to the good of human Societys in a greater mea&s;ure than any or all tho&s;e that compo&s;e them; which Cha|racter, I think, will be ill apply'd to all Kings. And that this may ap|pear to be true, I de&s;ire to know whether it would well have agreed with <HI>Nero, Caligula, Domitian,</HI> or others like to them; and if not with them, then not with all, bot only with tho&s;e who are endow'd with &s;uch Vertues. But if the King be made by man, he mu&s;t be &s;uch as man makes him to be; and if the power of a Law had bin given by any hu|man Sanction to the word of a fooli&s;h, mad or wicked man (which I hardly believe) it would be de&s;troy'd by its own iniquity and turpitude, and the People left under the obligation of rendring obedience to tho&s;e, who &s;o u&s;e the Sword that the Nations under them may live &s;oberly, peaceably and hone&s;tly.</P>
<P>This obliges me a little to examin what is meant by the Sword. The Pope &s;ays there are two Swords, the one temporal, the other &s;piritual; and that both of them were given to <HI>Peter</HI> and to his Succe&s;&s;ors. Others more rightly under&s;tand the two Swords to be that of War and that of
<PB N="269" REF="277">
Ju&s;tice, which according to &s;everal Con&s;titutions of Government have   bin committed to &s;everal hands, under &s;everal conditions and limitations. The Sword of Ju&s;tice comprehends the Legi&s;lative and the Executive Power: the one is exercis'd in making Laws, the other in judging Con|trover&s;ys according to &s;uch as are made. The military Sword is us'd by tho&s;e Magi&s;trats who have it, in making War or Peace with whom they think fit; and &s;ometimes by others who have it not, in pur&s;uing &s;uch Wars as are re&s;olv'd upon by another Power. The Jewi&s;h Doctors generally agree that the Kings of <HI>Judah</HI> could make no Law, becau&s;e there was a cur&s;e denounc'd again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;hould add to, or detract from that which God had given by the hand of <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> that they might &s;it in Judgment with the High Prie&s;t and Sanhedrin, but could not judg by them&s;elves, unle&s;s the Sanhedrin did plainly fail of performing their duty. Upon this account <HI>Maimonides</HI> excu&s;es <HI>David</HI> for commanding <HI>Solomon</HI> not to &s;uffer the grey hairs of <HI>Joab</HI> to go down to the grave in peace, and <HI>Solomon</HI> for appointing him to be kill'd at the foot of the Al|tar: for he having kill'd <HI>Abner</HI> and <HI>Ama&s;a,</HI> and by tho&s;e actions &s;hed the blood of war in time of peace, the Sanhedrin &s;hould have puni&s;h'd him; but being protected by favor or power, and even <HI>David</HI> him&s;elf fearing him, <HI>Solomon</HI> was put in mind of his duty, which he perform'd, tho <HI>Joab</HI> laid hold upon the horns of the Altar, which by the expre&s;s words of the Law gave no protection to wilful Murderers.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of the military Sword among&s;t them was al&s;o moderated. Their Kings might make War upon the &s;even accur&s;ed Nations that they were commanded to de&s;troy, and &s;o might any other man; for no peace was to be made with them: but not again&s;t any other Nation, without the a&s;&s;ent of the Sanhedrin. And when <HI>Amaziah</HI> contrary to that Law had fooli&s;hly made war upon <HI>Joa&s;h</HI> King of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and there|by brought a great &s;laughter upon <HI>Judah,</HI> the Princes, that is the Sanhedrin, combin'd again&s;t him, pur&s;u'd him to <HI>Lachi&s;h,</HI> and kill'd him there.</P>
<P>The Legi&s;lative Power of <HI>Sparta</HI> was evidently in the People. The Laws that go under the name of <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> were propos'd by him to the general A&s;&s;embly of the People, and from them receiv'd their Authority: But the di&s;ciplin they contain'd was of &s;uch efficacy &s;or framing the minds of men to vertue, and by bani&s;hing Silver and Gold they &s;o far bani&s;h'd all manner of Crimes, that from the in&s;titution of tho&s;e Laws to the times of their Corruption, which was more than eight hundred years, we hardly find that three men were put to death, of whom two were Kings; &s;o that it &s;eems difficult to determin where the power of judging did re&s;ide, tho 'tis mo&s;t probable, con&s;idering the nature of their Government, that it was in the Senat, and in Ca&s;es extraordinary in the <HI>Ephori,</HI> with a right of appealing to the People. Their Kings there&s;ore conld have little to do with the Sword of Ju&s;tice, neither the Legi&s;lative nor the Judicial Power being any ways in them.</P>
<P>The military Sword was not much more in their power, unle&s;s the excellency of their Vertues gave them the credit of per&s;uading, when the Law deny'd the right of commanding. They were oblig'd to make war again&s;t tho&s;e, and tho&s;e only, who were declar'd Enemys by the Senat and <HI>Ephori,</HI> and in the manner, place and time they directed: &s;o that <HI>Age&s;ilaus,</HI> tho carrying on a glorious War in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> no &s;ooner re|ceiv'd the Parchment Roll, wherein he was commanded by the <HI>Ephori</HI> to come home for the de&s;ence of his own Country, than he immediately

<P>By this it appears that there are Kings, who may be fear'd by tho&s;e that do ill, and not by &s;uch as do well; for having no more power than what the Law gives, and being oblig'd to execute it as the Law directs, they cannot depart from the Precept of the Apo&s;tle.

<P>The like may be &s;aid of almo&s;t all the Nations of the world, that have had any thing of Civil Order among&s;t them.

<P>If it be pretended that our later Kings are more to be fear'd than <HI>William</HI> the <HI>Norman,</HI> or his Predece&s;&s;ors, it mu&s;t not be, as has bin prov'd, either from the general right of Kings, or from the Doctrin of the Apo|&s;tle, but from &s;omething el&s;e that is peculiar and &s;ub&s;equent, which I leave our Author's Di&s;ciples to prove, and an an&s;wer may be found in due time. But to &s;how that our Ance&s;tors did not mi&s;take the words of the Apo&s;tle, 'tis good to con&s;ider when, to whom, and upon what occa&s;ion he &s;poke. The Chri&s;tian Religion was then in its infancy: his di&s;cour&s;es were addre&s;t to the Profe&s;&s;ors of it, who tho they &s;oon grew to be con&s;iderable in number, were for the mo&s;t part of the meane&s;t &s;ort of People, Servants or Inhabitants of the Citys, rather than Citi|zens and Freemen; join'd in no civil Body or Society, nor &s;uch as had or could have any part in the Government. The occa&s;ion was to &s;uppre&s;s the dangerous mi&s;take of many converted Jews and others, who know|ing them&s;elves to be freed from the power of Sin and the Devil, pre|&s;um'd they were al&s;o freed from the obligation of human Laws. And if this Error had not bin crop'd in the bud, it would have given occa|&s;ion to their Enemys, (who de&s;ir'd nothing more) to de&s;troy them all;
<PB N="272" REF="280">
  and who knowing that &s;uch Notions were &s;tirring among them, would have bin glad, that they who were not ea&s;ily to be di&s;cover'd, had by that means di&s;cover'd them&s;elves.</P>
<P>This induc'd a nece&s;&s;ity of diverting a poor, mean, &s;catter'd People from &s;uch thoughts concerning the State; to convince them of the Error into which they were fallen, that Chri&s;tians did not owe the &s;ame obe|dience to Civil Laws and Magi&s;trats as other men; and to keep them from drawing de&s;truction upon them&s;elves by &s;uch ways, as not being war|ranted by God, had no promi&s;e of his Protection. St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s work was to pre&s;erve the Profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity, as appears by his own words: <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 2.</NOTE><HI>I exhort, that fir&s;t of all, Supplications, Prayers, Interce&s;&s;ions, and giving of thanks be made for all men; for Kings, and for all that are in Authority, that we may live a quiet and peaceable life in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty. Put</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tit. 3.</NOTE><HI>them in mind to be &s;ubject to Principalitys and Powers, to obey Magi&s;trats, to be ready for every good work.</HI> St. <HI>Peter</HI> agrees with him fully in de&s;cribing the Magi&s;trate and his Duty; &s;hewing the rea&s;ons why obedience &s;hould be paid to him, and teaching Chri&s;tians to be humble and contented with their condition, as free, yet not u&s;ing their Liberty for a cover to malice; and not only to fear God and honor the King (of which conjunction of words &s;uch as <HI>Filmer</HI> are very proud) but <HI>to honor all men,</HI> as is &s;aid in the &s;ame ver&s;e. This was in a peculiar manner the work of that time, in which tho&s;e who were to preach and propagate the Go&s;pel, were not to be diverted from that Duty, by entangling them&s;elves in the care of State-affairs; but it dos in &s;ome &s;en&s;e agree with all times: for it can ne|ver be the duty of a good man to oppo&s;e &s;uch a Magi&s;trate as is the Mini|&s;ter of God, in the exerci&s;e of his Office, nor to deny to any man that which is his due.</P>
<P>But as the Chri&s;tian Law exempts no man from the Duty he ows to his Father, Ma&s;ter, or the Magi&s;trate, it dos not make him more a Slave than he was before, nor deprive him of any natural or civil Right; and if we are oblig'd to pay Tribute, Honor, or any other thing where it is not due, it mu&s;t be by &s;ome Precept very different from that which com|mands us to give to <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> that which is <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI>'s. If he define the Magi|&s;trate to be the Mini&s;ter of God doing Ju&s;tice, and from thence draws the Rea&s;ons he gives for rendring Obedience to him, we are to inquire who&s;e Mini&s;ter he is who overthrows it, and look for &s;ome other rea&s;on for rendring obedience to him than the words of the Apo&s;tles. If <HI>David,</HI> who was willing to lay down his life for the people, who <HI>hated iniquity,</HI> and would not <HI>&s;uffer a liar to come into his pre&s;ence,</HI> was the Mini&s;ter of God, I de&s;ire to know who&s;e Mini&s;ter <HI>Caligula</HI> was, who &s;et up him&s;elf to be wor&s;hip'd for a God, and would at once have de&s;troy'd all the people that he ought to have protected? Who&s;e Mini&s;ter was <HI>Nero,</HI> who, be|&s;ides the abominable impuritys of his life, and hatred to all Vertue as con|trary to his Per&s;on and Government, &s;et fire to the great City? If it be true, that <HI>contrariorum contraria e&s;t ratio,</HI> the&s;e que&s;tions are ea&s;ily decid|ed; and if the rea&s;ons of things are eternal, the &s;ame di&s;tinction grounded upon truth will be good for ever. Every Magi&s;trate and every man by his works will for ever declare who&s;e Mini&s;ter he is, in what &s;pirit he lives, and con&s;equently what obedience is due to him according to the Precept of the Apo&s;tle. If any man ask what I mean by Ju&s;tice, I an|&s;wer, That the Law of the Land, as far as it is <HI>Sanctio rect a, jubens ho|ne&s;ta, prohibens contraria,</HI> declares what it is. But there have bin and are Laws that are neither ju&s;t nor commendable. There was a Law in <HI>Rome,</HI>
<PB N="273" REF="281">
that no God &s;hould be wor&s;hip'd without the con&s;ent of the Senat: Up|on   which <HI>Tertullian</HI> &s;ays &s;coffingly, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ni&s;i homini Deus placuerit, Deus non erit.</NOTE><HI>That God &s;hall not be God, unle&s;s he plea&s;e Man:</HI> and by virtue of this Law the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians were expos'd to all manner of crueltys; and &s;ome of the Emperors (in other re&s;pects excellent Men) mo&s;t foully polluted them&s;elves and their Government with innocent Blood. <HI>Antoninus Pius</HI> was taken in this &s;nare; and <HI>Ter|tullian</HI> bitterly derides <HI>Trajan</HI> for glorying in his Clemency, when he had commanded <HI>Pliny,</HI> who was Procon&s;ul in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> not to make any &s;earch for Chri&s;tians, but only to puni&s;h them according to Law when they &s;hould be brought before him.

The&s;e, and an infinite number of others like to them, were not right Sanctions, but &s;uch as have produc'd un&s;peakable mi&s;chiefs and calamitys. They were not therefore Laws: the name of Ju&s;tice is abu&s;ively attributed to them: Tho&s;e that govern by them cannot be the Mini&s;ters of God: and the Apo&s;tle com|manding our obedience to the Mini&s;ter of God for our good, commands us not to be obedient to the Mini&s;ter of the Devil to our hurt; for we cannot &s;erve two Ma&s;ters.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XI. That which is not ju&s;t, is not Law; and that which is not Law, ought not to be obey'd.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author having for a long time pretended Con&s;cience, now pulls off his Mask, and plainly tells us, that 'tis not on account of Con|&s;cience, but for fear of puni&s;hment or in hope of reward, that Laws are to be obey'd. <HI>That familiar di&s;tinction of the Schoolmen,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>whereby they &s;ubject Kings to the directive, but not to the coactive Power of the Law, is a confe&s;&s;ion, that Kings are not bound by the po&s;itive Laws of any Nation, &s;ince the compul&s;ory Power of Laws is that which properly makes Laws to be Laws.</HI> Not troubling my &s;elf with this di&s;tinction of the Schoolmen, nor acknow|ledging any truth to be in it, or that they are competent Judges of &s;uch matters, I &s;ay, that if it be true, our Author's conclu&s;ion is altogether fal&s;e; for the directive Power of the Law, which is certain, and grounded upon the inherent good and rectitude that is in it, is that alone which has a power over the Con&s;cience, whereas the coercive is merely contingent; and the mo&s;t ju&s;t powers commanding the mo&s;t ju&s;t things, have &s;o o&s;ten fallen under the violence of the mo&s;t unju&s;t men command|ing the mo&s;t execrable villanys, that if they were therefore to be obey'd, the Con&s;ciences of men mu&s;t be regulated by the &s;ucce&s;s of a Battel or Con&s;piracy, than which nothing can be affirm'd more impious and ab|&s;urd.
<PB N="274" REF="282">
  By this rule <HI>David</HI> was not to be obey'd, when by the wicked|ne&s;s of his Son he was driven from <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and depriv'd of all coer|cive Power; and the con&s;cientious obedience that had bin due to him was transfer'd to <HI>Ab&s;alom,</HI> who &s;ought his life. And in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s time, it was not from him who was guided only by the Spirit of God, and had no manner of coercive Power, that Chri&s;tians were to learn their duty, but from <HI>Caligula, Claudius,</HI> and <HI>Nero,</HI> who had that Power well e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd by the mercenary Legions. If this were &s;o, the Governments of the World might be ju&s;tly call'd <HI>Magna Latrocinia;</HI> and men laying a&s;ide all con&s;iderations of Rea&s;on or Ju&s;tice, ought only to follow tho&s;e who can inflict the greate&s;t Puni&s;hments, or give the greate&s;t Rewards. But &s;ince the reception of &s;uch opinions would be the extirpation of all that can be call'd good, we mu&s;t look for another rule of our obedience, and &s;hall find that to be the Law, which being, as I &s;aid before, <HI>Sanctio recta,</HI> mu&s;t be founded upon that eternal Principle of Rea&s;on and Truth, from whence the rule of Ju&s;tice which is &s;acred and pure ought to be deduc'd, and not from the deprav'd will of man, which fluctuating according to the different Intere&s;ts, Humors and Pa&s;&s;ions that at &s;everal times reign in &s;everal Nations, one day abrogates what had bin enacted the other. The Sanction therefore that de&s;erves the name of a Law, <HI>which derives not its excellency from Antiquity, or from the dignity of the Legi&s;lators, but from an intrin&s;ick equity and ju&s;tice,</HI> ought to be made in pur&s;uance of that uni|ver&s;al Rea&s;on to which all Nations at all times owe an equal veneration and obedience. By this we may know whether he who has the Power dos ju&s;tice or not: Whether he be the Mini&s;ter of God to our good, a protector of good, and a terror to ill men; or the Mini&s;ter of the Devil to our hurt, by encouraging all manner of evil, and endeavouring by vice and corruption to make the people wor&s;e that they may be mi&s;erable, and mi&s;erable that they may be wor&s;e. I dare not &s;ay I &s;hall never fear &s;uch a man if he be arm'd with power: But I am &s;ure I &s;hall never e&s;teem him to be the Mini&s;ter of God, and &s;hall think I do ill if I fear him. If he has therefore a coercive Power over me, 'tis thro my weakne&s;s; <HI>for</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Qui cogi pote&s;t ne&s;cit mori.</NOTE><HI>he that will &s;uffer him&s;elf to be compel'd, knows not how to die.</HI> If there|fore he who dos not follow the directive Power of the Law, be not the Mini&s;ter of God, he is not a King, at lea&s;t not &s;uch a King as the Apo&s;tle commands us to obey: And if that Sanction which is not ju&s;t be not a Law, and can have no obligation upon us, by what Power &s;oever it be e&s;tabli&s;h'd, it may well fall out, that the Magi&s;trate who will not follow the directive Power of the Law, may fall under the coercive; and then the fear is turn'd upon him, with this aggravation, that it is not only actual, but ju&s;t. This was the ca&s;e of <HI>Nero;</HI> the coercive Power was no longer in him, but again&s;t him. He that was forc'd to fly and to hide him&s;elf, that was abandon'd by all men, and condemn'd to die <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">More Majorum. <BIBL>Sueton.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>accord|ing to antient Cu&s;tom,</HI> did, as I &s;uppo&s;e, fear, and was no way to be fear'd.

If any man &s;ay the&s;e things ought not to have bin done, an an&s;wer   may be given in a proper place; tho 'twere enough to &s;ay, that the Ju&s;tice of the world is not to be overthrown by a mere A&s;&s;ertion without proof: but that is nothing to the pre&s;ent Que&s;tion. For if it was ill done to drive <HI>Nero</HI> to de&s;pair, or to throw <HI>Vitellius</HI> into the common Shore, it was not becau&s;e they were the Mini&s;ters of God; for their Lives were no way conformable to the character which the Apo&s;tle gives of tho&s;e who de|&s;erve that Sacred Name. If tho&s;e only are to be fear'd who have the Power, there was a time when they were not to be fear'd, for they had none; and if &s;uch Princes are not oblig'd by the Law as are not under the coercive Power, it gave no exemption to tho&s;e, for they fell under it: and as we know not what will befal others who walk in their &s;teps till they are dead, we cannot till then know whether they are free from it or not.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XII. The Right and Power of a Magi&s;trate depends upon his In&s;ti|tution, not upon his Name.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS u&s;ual with Impo&s;tors to obtrude their deceits upon men, by putting fal&s;e names upon things, by which they may perplex mens minds, and from thence deduce fal&s;e Conclu&s;ions. But the points above&punc;mention'd being &s;ettled, it imports little whether the Governors to whom <HI>Peter</HI> enjoins obedience, were only Kings, and &s;uch as are employ'd by them, or all &s;uch Magi&s;trats as are the Mini&s;ters of God; for he informs us of their Works that we may know them, and accordingly yield obe|dience to them. This is that therefore which di&s;tingui&s;hes the Magi|&s;trate to whom obedience is due, from him to whom none is due, and not the name that he either a&s;&s;umes, or others put upon him. But if there be any virtue in the word King, and that the admirable Prerogatives, of which our Author dreams, were annex'd to that Name, they could not be apply'd to the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, nor their &s;ub&s;tituted Officers, for they had it not. 'Tis true, <HI>Mark Anthony,</HI> in a drunken fit, at the celebra|tion of the impure <HI>Lupercalia,</HI> did offer a Diadem to <HI>Julius Ce&s;ar,</HI> which &s;ome flatterers pre&s;t him to accept, (as our great Lawyers did <HI>Cromwel)</HI> but he dur&s;t not think of putting it upon his Head. <HI>Caligula</HI>'s affecta|tion of that title, and the en&s;igns of Royalty he wore, were taken for the mo&s;t evident marks of his madne&s;s: and tho the greate&s;t and brave&s;t of their men had fallen by the Wars or Pro&s;criptions; tho the be&s;t part of the Senat had peri&s;h'd in <HI>The&s;&s;aly;</HI> tho the great City was exhau&s;ted, and <HI>Italy</HI> brought to de&s;olation, yet they were not reduc'd &s;o low as to endure a King. <HI>Pi&s;o</HI> was &s;ufficiently addicted to <HI>Tiberius,</HI> yet he could not &s;uf|fer that <HI>Germanicus</HI> &s;hould be treated as the Son of a King; <HI>Prin|cipis Romani non Parthorum regis &s;ilio has epulas dari.</HI> And whoever un|der&s;tands the Latin Tongue, and the Hi&s;tory of tho&s;e times, will ea&s;ily perceive that the word <HI>Princeps</HI> &s;ignify'd no more than a principal or emi|nent man, as has bin already prov'd: and the words of <HI>Pi&s;o</HI> could have no other meaning, than that the Son of a <HI>Roman</HI> ought not to be di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd from others, as the Sons of the <HI>Parthian</HI> Kings were. This is verify'd by his Letter to <HI>Tiberius</HI> under the name of Friend, and the

They exercis'd as they pleas'd, or as they dur&s;t, the power that had bin gain'd by violence or fraud. The exorbitances they committed, could not have bin ju&s;tify'd by a Title, any more than tho&s;e of a Pyrat who &s;hould take the &s;ame.

If this be too ab&s;urd and abominable to enter into the heart of a man, it mu&s;t be concluded, that their intention was only to divert the poor People to whom they preach'd, from involving them&s;elves in the care of Civil matters, to which they had no call. And the Coun&s;el would have bin good (as things &s;tood with them) if they had bin under the power of a Pyrat, or any other villain &s;ub&s;ti|tuted by him.</P>
<P>But tho the Apo&s;tles had look'd upon the Officers &s;et over the Pro|vinces belonging to the Roman Empire, as &s;ent by Kings, I de&s;ire to know whether it can be imagin'd, that they could think the &s;ubordinate Governors to be &s;ent by Kings, in the Countrys that had no Kings; or that obedience became due to the Magi&s;trats in <HI>Greece, Italy,</HI> or other Provinces under the juri&s;diction of <HI>Rome,</HI> only after they had Emperors, and that none was due to them before? The <HI>Germans</HI> had then no King: The brave <HI>Arminius</HI> had bin lately kill'd for aiming at a Crown. When he had blemi&s;h'd all his Vertues by that attempt, they forgot his former Services. They never con&s;ider'd how many Roman Legions he had cut in pieces, nor how many thou&s;ands of their Allies he had de&s;troy'd. His Valor was a crime de&s;erving death, when he &s;ought to make a Prey of his Country, which he had &s;o bravely defended, and to en&s;lave tho&s;e who with him had fought for the publick Liberty. But if the Apo&s;tles were to be under&s;tood to give the name of God's Mini&s;ters only to Kings, and tho&s;e who are employ'd by them, and that obedience is due
<PB N="277" REF="285">
to no other, a dome&s;tick Tyrant had bin their greate&s;t Benefactor. He   had &s;et up the only Government that is authoriz'd by God, and to which a con&s;cientious obedience is due. <HI>Agathocles, Diony&s;ius, Phalaris, Phaereus, Pi&s;i&s;tratus, Nabis, Machanidas,</HI> and an infinite number of the mo&s;t dete&s;table Villains that the world has ever produc'd, did confer the &s;ame benefits upon the Countrys they en&s;lav'd. But if this be equally fal&s;e, &s;otti&s;h, ab&s;urd, and execrable, all tho&s;e Epithets belong to our Author and his Doctrin, for attempting to depre&s;s all mode&s;t and regular Magi&s;tracys, and endeavouring to corrupt the Scripture to patronize the greate&s;t of Crimes. No man therefore who dos not delight in error, can think that the Apo&s;tle de&s;ign'd preci&s;ely to determin &s;uch que&s;tions as might ari&s;e concerning any one man's right, or in the lea&s;t degree to pre|fer any one form of Government before another. In acknowledging the Magi&s;trate to be Man's Ordinance, he declares that Man who makes him to be, may make him to be what he plea&s;es; and tho there is found more prudence and vertue in one Nation than in another, that Magi&s;tra|cy which is e&s;tabli&s;h'd in any one ought to be obey'd, till they who made the e&s;tabli&s;hment think fit to alter it. All therefore whil&s;t they continue, are to be look'd upon with the &s;ame re&s;pect. Every Nation acting freely, has an equal right to frame their own Government, and to employ &s;uch Officers as they plea&s;e. The Authority, Right and Power of the&s;e mu&s;t be regulated by the judgment, right and power of tho&s;e who appoint them, without any relation at all to the name that is given; for that is no way e&s;&s;ential to the thing. The &s;ame name is frequently given to tho&s;e, who differ exceedingly in right and power; and the &s;ame right and power is as often annex'd to Magi&s;tracys that differ in name. The &s;ame power which had bin in the Roman Kings, was given to the Con|&s;uls; and that which had bin legally in the Dictators for a time not ex|ceeding &s;ix months, was afterwards u&s;urp'd by the <HI>Ce&s;ars,</HI> and made perpetual. The &s;upreme Power (which &s;ome pretend belongs to all Kings) has bin and is enjoy'd in the fulle&s;t extent by &s;uch as never had the name; and no Magi&s;tracy was ever more re&s;train'd than tho&s;e that had the name of Kings in <HI>Sparta, Arragon, England, Poland,</HI> and other places. They therefore that did thus in&s;titute, regulate and re&s;train, create Magi&s;tracys, and give them names and powers as &s;eem'd be&s;t to them, could not but have in them&s;elves the coercive as well as the di|rective over them: for the regulation and re&s;triction is coercion; but mo&s;t of all the in&s;titution, by which they could make them to be or not to be. As to the exterior &s;orce, 'tis &s;ometimes on the &s;ide of the Ma|gi&s;trate, and &s;ometimes on that of the People; and as Magi&s;trats under &s;everal names have the &s;ame work incumbent upon 'em, and the &s;ame Power to per&s;orm it, the &s;ame Duty is to be exacted from them, and render'd to them: which being di&s;tinctly proportion'd by the Laws of every Country, I may conclude, that all Magi&s;tratical Power being the Ordinance of Man in pur&s;uance of the Ordinance of God, receives its being and mea&s;ure from the Legi&s;lative Power of every Nation. And whether the power be plac'd &s;imply in one, a few, or many men; or in one body compos'd of the three &s;imple Species; whether the &s;ingle Per|&s;on be call'd King, Duke, Marque&s;s, Emperor, Sultan, Mogol, or Grand Signor; or the number go under the name of Senat, Council, Pregadi, Diet, A&s;&s;embly of E&s;tates and the like, 'tis the &s;ame thing. The &s;ame obedience is equally due to all, whil&s;t according to the Precept of the Apo&s;tle, they do the work of God for our good: and if they

  depart from it, no one of them has a better Title than the other to our obedience.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XIII. Laws were made to direct and in&s;truct Magi&s;trats, and, if they will not be directed, to re&s;train them.</HEAD>
<P>I Know not who they are that our Author introduces to &s;ay, that <HI>the fir&s;t invention of Laws was to bridle or moderate the overgreat Power of Kings;</HI> and unle&s;s they give &s;ome better proof of their judg|ment in other things, &s;hall little e&s;teem them. They &s;hould have con|&s;ider'd, that there are Laws in many places where there are no Kings; that there were Laws in many before there were Kings, as in <HI>I&s;rael</HI> the Law was given three hundred years before they had any; but mo&s;t e&s;pecially, that as no man can be a rightful King except by Law, nor have any ju&s;t Power but from the Law, if that Power be found to be overgreat, the Law that gave it mu&s;t have bin before that which was to moderate or re&s;train it; for that could not be moderated which was not in being. Leaving therefore our Author to fight with the&s;e Adver&s;arys if he plea&s;e when he finds them, I &s;hall proceed to examin his own Po|&s;itions. <HI>The truth is,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>the Original of Laws was for the keeping of the Multitude in order. Popular E&s;tates could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t at all without Laws, whereas Kingdoms were govern'd many Ages without them. The Peo|ple of</HI> Athens, <HI>as &s;oon as they gave over Kings, were forc'd to give power to</HI> Draco <HI>fir&s;t, then to</HI> Solon, <HI>to make them Laws.</HI> If we will believe him therefore, where&s;oever there is a King, or a man who by having power in his hands is in the place of a King, there is no need of Law. He takes them all to be &s;o wi&s;e, ju&s;t, and good, that they are Laws to them|&s;elves, <HI>Leges viventes.</HI> This was certainly verify'd by the whole &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Ce&s;ars,</HI> the ten la&s;t Kings of <HI>Pharamond</HI>'s Race, all the Succe&s;&s;ors of <HI>Charles</HI> the Great, and others that I am not willing to name; but referring my &s;elf to Hi&s;tory, I de&s;ire all rea&s;onable men to con&s;ider, whether the piety and tender care that was natural to <HI>Caligula, Nero</HI> or <HI>Domitian,</HI> was &s;uch a &s;ecurity to the Nations that liv'd under them, as without Law to be &s;ufficient for their pre&s;ervation: for if the contrary appear to be true, and that their Government was a perpetual exerci&s;e of rage, malice and madne&s;s, by which the wor&s;t of men were arm'd with power to de&s;troy the be&s;t, &s;o that the Empire could only be &s;av'd by their de&s;truction, 'tis mo&s;t certain, that mankind can never fall into a condition which &s;tands more in need of Laws to protect the innocent, than when &s;uch Mon&s;ters reign who endeavour their extirpation, and are too well furni&s;h'd with means to accompli&s;h their dete&s;table de&s;igns. Without any prejudice therefore to the Cau&s;e that I defend, I might con|fe&s;s that all Nations were at the fir&s;t govern'd by Kings, and that no Laws were impos'd upon tho&s;e Kings, till they or the Succe&s;&s;ors of tho&s;e who had bin advanc'd for their vertues, by falling into vice and cor|ruption, did manife&s;tly di&s;cover the inconveniences of depending upon their will. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are al&s;o children, women and fools, that often come to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Kingdoms, who&s;e weakne&s;s and igno|rance &s;tands in as great need of &s;upport and direction, as the de&s;perate
<PB N="279" REF="287">
fury of the others can do of re&s;triction. And if &s;ome Nations had bin   &s;o &s;otti&s;h, not to fore&s;ee the mi&s;chief of leaving them to their will, o|thers, or the &s;ame in &s;ucceeding Ages di&s;covering them, could no more be oblig'd to continue in &s;o pernicious a folly, than we are to live in that wretched Barbarity in which the <HI>Romans</HI> found our Ance&s;tors, when they fir&s;t enter'd this I&s;land.</P>
<P>If any man &s;ay, that <HI>Filmer</HI> dos not &s;peak of Mon&s;ters, nor of Chil|dren, Women or Fools, but of wi&s;e, ju&s;t and good Princes: I an&s;wer, that if there be a right inherent in Kings, as Kings, of doing what they plea&s;e; and in tho&s;e who are next in blood, to &s;ucceed them and inherit the &s;ame, it mu&s;t belong to all Kings, and &s;uch as upon title of blood would be Kings. And as there is no family that may not, and dos not often produce &s;uch as I mention'd, it mu&s;t al&s;o be acknowledg'd in them: and that power which is left to the wi&s;e, ju&s;t and good, upon a &s;uppo&s;i|tion that they will not make an ill u&s;e of it, mu&s;t be devolv'd to tho&s;e who will not or cannot make a good one; but will either maliciou&s;ly turn it to the de&s;truction of tho&s;e they ought to protect, or thro weakne&s;s &s;uf|fer it to fall into the hands of tho&s;e that govern them, who are found by experience to be for the mo&s;t part the wor&s;t of all, mo&s;t apt to u&s;e the ba&s;e&s;t arts, and to flatter the humors, and foment the vices that are mo&s;t prevalent in weak and vicious Princes. <HI>Germanicus, Corbulo, Valerius A&s;iaticus, Thra&s;eas, Soranus, Helvidius Pri&s;cus, Julius Agricola,</HI> and other excellent men liv'd in the times of <HI>Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius</HI> and <HI>Nero;</HI> but the power was put into the hands of <HI>Sejanus, Macro, Tigellinus,</HI> and other Villains like to them: and I wi&s;h there were not too many modern examples to &s;hew that weak and vicious Princes will never chu&s;e &s;uch as &s;hall pre&s;erve Nations from the mi&s;chiefs that would en&s;ue upon their own incapacity or malice; but that they mu&s;t be impos'd upon them by &s;ome other power, or Nations be ruin'd for want of them. This impo|&s;ition mu&s;t be by Law or by Force. But as Laws are made to keep things in good order without the nece&s;&s;ity of having recour&s;e to force, it would be a dangerous extravagance to arm that Prince with force, which pro|bably in a &s;hort time mu&s;t be oppos'd by force; and tho&s;e who have bin guilty of this error, as the Kingdoms of the Ea&s;t, and the antient <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, where no provi&s;ion was made by Law again&s;t ill-governing Princes, have found no other remedy than to kill them, when by extreme &s;ufferings they were driven beyond patience: and this fell out &s;o often, that few of their Princes were ob&s;erv'd to die by a common death. But &s;ince the Empire was tran&s;mitted to <HI>Germany,</HI> and the Emperors re&s;train'd by I aws, that Nation has never bin brought to the odious extremitys of &s;uffering all manner of Indignitys, or revenging them upon the heads of Princes. And if the Pope had not di&s;turb'd 'em upon the account of Re|ligion, nor driven their Princes to di&s;turb others, they might have pa&s;s'd many ages without any civil Di&s;&s;en&s;ion, and all their Emperors might have liv'd happily, and dy'd peaceably, as mo&s;t of them have done.</P>
<P>This might be &s;ufficient to my purpo&s;e: for if all Princes without di&s;tinc|tion, whether good or bad, wi&s;e or fooli&s;h, young or old, &s;ober or mad, cannot be intru&s;ted with an unlimited power; and if the power they have, ought to be limited by Law, that Nations may not, with danger to them|&s;elves, as well as to the Prince, have recour&s;e to the la&s;t remedy, this Law mu&s;t be given to all, and the good can be no otherwi&s;e di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the bad, and the wi&s;e from the fooli&s;h, than by the ob&s;ervation or viola|tion of it. But I may ju&s;tly go a &s;tep farther, and affirm, that this Law
<PB N="280" REF="288">
  which by re&s;training the Lu&s;ts of the vicious and fooli&s;h, frequently pre|&s;erves them from the de&s;truction they would bring upon them&s;elves or people, and &s;ometimes upon both, is an a&s;&s;i&s;tance and direction to the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t; &s;o that they al&s;o as well as the Nations under them are gainers by it. This will appear &s;trange only to tho&s;e who know not <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quam grave &amp; intolerandum &s;it cuncta regendi onus. <BIBL>Tacit.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>how difficult and in&s;upportable the Government of great Nations is,</HI> and how un|able the be&s;t man is to bear it. And if it &s;urpa&s;s the &s;trength of the be&s;t, it may ea&s;ily be determin'd how ordinary men will behave them&s;elves under it, or what u&s;e the wor&s;t will make of it. I know there have bin wi&s;e and good Kings; but they had not an ab&s;olute Power, nor would have accepted it, tho it had bin offer'd: much le&s;s can I believe that any of them would have tran&s;mitted &s;uch a power to their po&s;terity, when none of them could know any more than <HI>Solomon,</HI> whether his Son would be a wi&s;e man or a fool. But if the be&s;t might have de&s;ir'd, and had bin able to bear it (tho <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> by his own confe&s;&s;ion was not) that could be no rea&s;on why it &s;hould be given to the wor&s;t and weake&s;t, or tho&s;e who probably will be &s;o: Since the a&s;&s;urance that it will not be a|bus'd during the life of one man, is nothing to the con&s;titution of a State which aims at perpetuity: And no man knowing what men will be, e&s;pe|cially if they come to the power by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which may properly e|nough be call'd by chance, 'tis rea&s;onably to be fear'd they will be bad, and con&s;equently nece&s;&s;ary &s;o to limit their power, that if they prove to be &s;o, the Commonwealth may not be de&s;troy'd, which they were in&s;ti|tuted to pre&s;erve. The Law provides for this in leaving to the King a full and ample power of doing as much good as his heart can wi&s;h, and in re&s;training his power &s;o, that if he &s;hould depart from the duty of his Office, the Nation may not peri&s;h. This is a help to tho&s;e who are wi&s;e and good, by directing them what they are to do, more certainly than any one man's per&s;onal judgment can do; and no prejudice at all, &s;ince no &s;uch man did ever complain he was not &s;uffer'd to do the evil which he would abhor if it were in his power; and is a mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary curb to the fury of bad Princes, preventing them from bringing de&s;truction upon the people. Men are &s;o &s;ubject to vices and pa&s;&s;ions, that they &s;tand in need of &s;ome re&s;traint in every condition; but mo&s;t e&s;pecially when they are in power. The rage of a private man may be pernicious to one or a few of his Neighbours; but the fury of an unlimited Prince would drive whole Nations into ruin: And tho&s;e very men who have liv'd mo|de&s;tly when they had little power, have often prov'd the mo&s;t &s;avage of all Mon&s;ters, when they thought nothing able to re&s;i&s;t their rage. 'Tis &s;aid of <HI>Caligula,</HI> that no man ever knew <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Nec meliorem &s;ervum, nec deteriorem dominum.</NOTE><HI>a better Servant, nor a wor&s;e Ma&s;ter.</HI> The want of re&s;traint made him a Bea&s;t, who might have con|tinu'd to be a Man. And tho I cannot &s;ay, that our Law nece&s;&s;arily ad|mits the next in Blood to the Succe&s;&s;ion (for the contrary is prov'd) yet the facility of our Ance&s;tors, in receiving children, women, or &s;uch men as were not more able than them&s;elves to bear the weight of a Crown, convinces me fully, that they had &s;o fram'd our Laws, that even chil|dren, women, or ill men, might either perform as much as was nece&s;&s;ari|ly requir'd of 'em, or be brought to rea&s;on if they tran&s;gre&s;t, and arro|gated to them&s;elves more than was allow'd. For 'tis not to be imagin'd,
<PB N="281" REF="289">
that a company of men &s;hould &s;o far degenerate from their own Nature,   which is Rea&s;on, to give up them&s;elves and their Po&s;terity, with all their concernments in the world, to depend upon the will of a child, a woman, an ill man, or a fool.</P>
<P>If therefore Laws are nece&s;&s;ary to popular States, they are no le&s;s to Monarchys; or rather, that is not a State or Government which has them not: and 'tis no le&s;s impo&s;&s;ible for any to &s;ub&s;i&s;t without 'em, than for the body of a man to be, and perform its functions without Nerves or Bones. And if any People had ever bin &s;o fooli&s;h to e&s;tabli&s;h that which they call'd a Government, without Laws to &s;upport and regulate it, the impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting would evidence the madne&s;s of the Con&s;titution, and ought to deter all others from following their example.</P>
<P>'Tis no le&s;s incredible, that tho&s;e Nations which rejected Kings, did put them&s;elves into the Power of one man, to pre&s;cribe to 'em &s;uch Laws as he pleas'd. But the in&s;tances alledg'd by our Author are evidently fal&s;e. The <HI>Athenians</HI> were not without Laws when they had Kings: <HI>Aegeus</HI> was &s;ubject to the Laws, and did nothing of importance without the con&s;ent of the People; and <HI>The&s;eus</HI> not being able to plea&s;e them, dy'd a bani&s;h'd man: <HI>Draco</HI> and <HI>Solon</HI> did not make, but propo&s;e Laws, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. vit. Solon.</NOTE>they were of no force till e&s;tabli&s;h'd by the Authority of the People. The <HI>Spartans</HI> dealt in the &s;ame manner with <HI>Lycurgus;</HI> he invented their Laws, but the People made them: and when the A&s;&s;embly of all the Citizens had approv'd and &s;worn to ob&s;erve them till his return from <HI>Crete,</HI> he re&s;olv'd rather to die in a voluntary bani&s;hment, than by his re|turn to ab&s;olve them from the Oath they had taken. The <HI>Romans</HI> al&s;o had Laws during the Government of their Kings; but not finding in 'em that Perfection they de&s;ir'd, the <HI>Decemviri</HI> were cho&s;en to frame others, which yet were of no value till they were pa&s;s'd by the People in the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ingenti hominum con&s;en&s;u propo&s;itis decem Tabulis Populum ad concionem convocarunt, &amp; quod bonum, fau&s;tum foelix&abque; &s;it Reipublicae, ip&s;is, liberi&s;&abque; eorum e&s;&s;et, ire, &amp; legere propo&s;itas ju&s;&s;ere. <BIBL>T.

But if we may believe our Author, the Powers Judicial and Legi&s;lative, that of judging as well as that of go|verning, is not too much for any man, woman, or child what&s;oever: and that he &s;tands in no need, either of God's Statutes to direct him, or Man's Coun&s;el to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, unle&s;s it be when he is otherwi&s;e employ'd; and his Will alone is &s;ufficient for all. But what if he be not bu&s;y'd in greater matters, or di&s;tracted with publick cares; is every Prince capable of this work? Tho <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> had not found it too great for him; or it &s;hould be granted that a man of excellent natural Endowments, great Wi&s;dom, Learning, Experience, Indu&s;try, and Integrity might perform it, is it certain that all tho&s;e who happen to be born in reigning Familys are &s;o? If <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> had the Law of God before his eyes, and could repair to God him&s;elf for the application or explanation of it; have all Princes the &s;ame A&s;&s;i&s;tance? Do they all &s;peak with God face to face, or can they do what he did, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance he had? If all Kings of mature years are of that perfection, are we a&s;&s;ur'd that none &s;hall dy before his Heir arrive to the &s;ame? Or &s;hall he have the &s;ame ripene&s;s of Judgment in his Infan|cy? If a Child come to a Crown, dos that immediately infu&s;e the mo&s;t admirable Endowments and Graces? Have we any promi&s;e from Hea|ven, that Women &s;hall enjoy the &s;ame Prerogatives in tho&s;e Countrys where they are made capable of the Succe&s;&s;ion? Or dos that Law which renders them capable, not only defend them again&s;t the frailty of their own Nature, but confer the mo&s;t &s;ublime vertues upon them? But who knows not, that no Familys do more frequently produce weak or ill men, than the greate&s;t? and that which is wor&s;e, their greatne&s;s is a &s;nare to
<PB N="283" REF="291">
them; &s;o that they, who in a low condition might have pa&s;s'd unregard|ed,   being advanc'd to the highe&s;t, have often appear'd to be, or became the wor&s;t of all Bea&s;ts; and they who advance them are like to them: For if the Power be in the Multitude, as our Author is forc'd to confe&s;s (otherwi&s;e the <HI>Athenians</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> could not have given all as he &s;ays, nor a part as I &s;ay, to <HI>Draco, Solon,</HI> or the <HI>Decemviri)</HI> they mu&s;t be Bea&s;ts al&s;o, who &s;hould have given away their Right and Liberty, in hopes of receiving Ju&s;tice from &s;uch as probably will neither under&s;tand nor regard it, or protection from tho&s;e who will not be able to help them&s;elves, and expect &s;uch Vertue, Wi&s;dom, and Integrity &s;hould be, and for ever remain in the Family they &s;et up, as was never known to continue in any. If the Power be not confer'd upon them, they have it not; and if they have it not, their want of lei&s;ure to do Ju&s;tice, cannot have bin the cau&s;e for which Laws are made; and they cannot be the &s;ignification of their Will, but are that to which the Prince ows obedience, as well as the meane&s;t Subject. This is that which <HI>Bracton</HI> calls <HI>e&s;&s;e &s;ub lege,</HI> and &s;ays, that <HI>Rex in regno &s;uperiores habet Deum &amp; Legem. Forte&s;cue</HI> &s;ays, The Kings of <HI>England</HI> cannot change the Laws: and indeed, they are &s;o far from having any &s;uch Power, that the Judges &s;wear to have no regard to the King's Letters or Commands, but if they receive any, to proceed according to Law, as if they had not bin. And the breach of this Oath dos not only bring a blemi&s;h upon their Reputation, but expo&s;es them to capital Puni&s;hments, as many of them have found. 'Tis not therefore the King that makes the Law, but the Law that makes the King. It gives the rule for Succe&s;&s;ion, making Kingdoms &s;ometimes Heredi|tary, and &s;ometimes Elective, and (more often than either &s;imply) He|reditary under condition. In &s;ome places Males only are capable of in|heriting, in others Females are admitted. Where the Monarchy is regular, as in <HI>Germany, England,</HI> &amp;c. the Kings can neither make nor change Laws: They are under the Law, and the Law is not under them; their Letters or Commands are not to be regarded: In the ad|mini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice, the que&s;tion is not what plea&s;es them, but what the Law declares to be right, which mu&s;t have its cour&s;e, whether the King be bu&s;y or at lei&s;ure, whether he will or not. The King who ne|ver dys, is always pre&s;ent in the &s;upreme Courts, and neither knows nor regards the plea&s;ure of the man that wears the Crown. But le&s;t by his Riches and Power he might have &s;ome influence upon judicial Pro|ceedings, the <HI>great Charter</HI> that recapitulates and acknowledges our an|tient inherent Libertys, obliges him to &s;wear, that he will neither &s;ell, delay, nor deny Ju&s;tice to any man, according to the Laws of the Land: which were ridiculous and ab&s;urd, if tho&s;e Laws were only the &s;ignifi|cation of his Plea&s;ure, or any way depended upon his Will. This Char|ter having bin confirm'd by more than thirty Parliaments, all &s;ucceeding Kings are under the obligation of the &s;ame Oath, or mu&s;t renounce the benefit they receive from our Laws, which if they do, they will be &s;ound to be equal to every one of us.</P>
<P>Our Author, according to his cu&s;tom, having laid down a fal&s;e pro|po&s;ition, gos about to ju&s;tify it by mi&s;applying the examples of <HI>Draco, Solon,</HI> the <HI>Decemviri,</HI> and <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> of whom no one had the Power he attributes to them, and it were nothing to us if they had. The <HI>Atheni|ans</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> as was &s;aid before, were &s;o far from re&s;igning the ab|&s;olute Power without appeal to them&s;elves, that nothing done by their Magi&s;trats was o&s; any force, till it was enacted by the People. And the
<PB N="284" REF="292">
  power given to the <HI>Decemviri, &s;ine provocatione,</HI> was only in private ca&s;es, there being no &s;uperior Magi&s;trate then in being, to whom Ap|peals could be made. They were ve&s;ted with the &s;ame Power the Kings and Dictators enjoy'd, from whom there lay no Appeal, but to the People, and always to them; as appears by the ca&s;e of <HI>Horatius</HI> in the time of <HI>Tullus Ho&s;tilius,</HI> that of <HI>Marcus Fabius</HI> when <HI>Papyrius Cur&s;or</HI> was Dictator, and of <HI>Nenius</HI> the Tribun when <HI>Q. Fabius Maximus</HI> was in the &s;ame Office; all which I have cited already, and refer to them. There was therefore a re&s;ervation of the &s;upreme Power in the People, notwith&s;tanding the creation of Magi&s;trats without Appeal; and as it was quietly exercis'd in making Strangers, or whom they pleas'd Kings, re&s;training the power of Dictators to &s;ix months, and that of the <HI>Decem|viri</HI> to two years; when the la&s;t did, contrary to Law, endeavour by force to continue their Power, the People did by force de&s;troy it and them.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> is yet more clear: he was the mo&s;t humble and gentle of all men: he never rais'd his heart above his brethren, and com|manded Kings to live in the &s;ame mode&s;ty: he never de&s;ir'd the People &s;hould depend upon his will: In giving Laws to them he fulfill'd the will of God, not his own; and tho&s;e Laws were not the &s;ignification of his will, but of the will of God. They were the production of God's Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s, not the invention of Man; given to purify the People, not to advance the glory of their Leader. He was not proud and in&s;olent, nor pleas'd with that o&s;tentation of Pomp, to which Fools give the name of Maje&s;ty: and whoever &s;o far exalts the power of a man, to make Nations depend upon his plea&s;ure, dos not only lay a bur|den upon him, which neither <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> nor any other could ever bear, and every wi&s;e man will always abhor; but with an impious fury, endea|vours to &s;et up a Government contrary to the Laws of God, pre&s;umes to accu&s;e him of want of wi&s;dom, or goodne&s;s to his own People, and to correct his Errors, which is a work fit to be undertaken by &s;uch as our Author.</P>
<P>From hence, as upon a &s;olid foundation, he proceeds, and making u&s;e of King <HI>James</HI>'s words, infers, that Kings are above the Laws, becau&s;e he &s;o teaches us. But he might have remember'd, that having affirm'd the People could not judg of the di&s;putes that might happen between them and Kings, becau&s;e they mu&s;t not be judges in their own ca&s;e, 'tis ab&s;urd to make a King judg of a ca&s;e &s;o nearly concerning him&s;elf, in the deci&s;ion of which his own Pa&s;&s;ions and Intere&s;ts may probably lead him into errors. And if it be pretended that I do the &s;ame, in giving the judgment of tho&s;e matters to the People, the ca&s;e is utterly different, both in the nature and con&s;equences. The King's judgment is merely for him&s;elf; and if that were to take place, all the Pa&s;&s;ions and Vices that have mo&s;t power upon men, would concur to corrupt it. He that is &s;et up for the publick good, can have no conte&s;t with the whole People who&s;e good he is to procure, unle&s;s he deflect from the end of his In&s;ti|tution, and &s;et up an Intere&s;t of his own in oppo&s;ition to it. This is in its nature the highe&s;t o&s; all delinquencys; and if &s;uch a one may be judg of his own crimes, he is not only &s;ure to avoid puni&s;hment, but to obtain all that he &s;ought by them; and the wor&s;e he is, the more violent will his d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ires be, to get all the power into his hands, that he may grati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y his lu&s;ts, and execute his pernicious de&s;igns. On the other &s;ide, in a popular A&s;&s;embly, no man judges for him&s;elf, otherwi&s;e than as his good
<PB N="285" REF="293">
is comprehended in that of the publick: Nothing hurts him, but what   is prejudicial to the Commonwealth: Such among&s;t them as may have receiv'd private injurys, are &s;o far only con&s;ider'd by others, as their &s;ufferings may have influence upon the publick; if they be few, and the matters not great, others will not &s;uffer their quiet to be di&s;turb'd by them; if they are many and grievous, the Tyranny thereby appears to be &s;o cruel, that the Nation cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t, unle&s;s it be corrected or &s;uppre&s;t. Corruption of Judgment proceeds from private Pa&s;&s;ions, which in the&s;e ca&s;es never govern: and tho a zeal for the publick good may po&s;&s;ibly be mi&s;guided, yet till it be &s;o, it can never be capable of exce&s;s. The la&s;t <HI>Tarquin,</HI> and his leud Son, exercis'd their Fury and Lu&s;t in the murders of the be&s;t men in <HI>Rome,</HI> and the rape of <HI>Lucretia. Appius Claudius</HI> was fill'd with the like madne&s;s. <HI>Caligula</HI> and <HI>Nero</HI> were &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the power of committing the wor&s;t of Vil|lanys, that we do not hear of any man that offer'd to defend him&s;elf, or woman that pre&s;um'd to refu&s;e them. If they had bin judges in the&s;e ca&s;es, the utmo&s;t of all Villanys and Mi&s;chiefs had bin e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Law: but as long as the judgment of the&s;e matters was in the People, no private or corrupt Pa&s;&s;ion could take place. <HI>Lucius Brutus, Valerius, Horatius</HI> and <HI>Virginius,</HI> with the People that follow'd them, did not by the expul&s;ion of the Kings, or the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Decemviri,</HI> a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves a power of committing Rapes and Murders, nor any ad|vantages beyond what their equals might think they de&s;erv'd by their vertues, and &s;ervices to the Commonwealth; nor had they more credit than others for any other rea&s;on, than that they &s;hew'd them&s;elves mo&s;t forward in procuring the publick Good, and by their Valor and Conduct be&s;t able to promote it.</P>
<P>What&s;oever happen'd after the overthrow of their Liberty, belongs not to my Subject, for there was nothing of popularity in the judgments that were made. One Tyrant de&s;troy'd another; the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ions and Vices for the mo&s;t part reign'd in both: The la&s;t was often as bad as his Predece&s;&s;or whom he had overthrown; and one was &s;ometimes approv'd by the People for no other rea&s;on, than that it was thought impo&s;&s;ible for him to be wor&s;e than he who was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Power. But if one in&s;tance can be of force among&s;t an infinite number of various Accidents, the words of <HI>Valerius A&s;iaticus,</HI> who, by wi&s;hing he had bin the man that had kill'd <HI>Caligula,</HI> did in a moment pacify the fury of the Soldiers who were looking for tho&s;e that had done it, &s;hew, that as long as men retain any thing of that Rea&s;on which is truly their Nature, they never fail of judging rightly of Vertue and Vice; whereas violent and ill Princes have always done the contrary, and even the be&s;t do often deflect from the rules of Ju&s;tice, as appears not only by the examples of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t and third, who were brought to confe&s;s it, but even tho&s;e of <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Solomon.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, to &s;hew that the deci&s;ion of the&s;e Controver&s;ys cannot belong to any King, but to the People, we are only to con&s;ider, that as Kings and all other Magi&s;trats, whether &s;upreme or &s;ubordinate, are con&s;tituted only for the good of the People, the People only can be fit to judg whether the end be accompli&s;h'd. A Phy&s;ician dos not exerci&s;e his Art for him&s;elf, but for his Patients; and when I am, or think I &s;hall be &s;ick, I &s;end for him of whom I have the be&s;t opinion, that he may help me to recover or pre&s;erve my health; but I lay him a&s;ide if I find him to be negligent, ignorant or unfaithful: and it would be ridiculous for
<PB N="286" REF="294">
  him to &s;ay, I make my &s;elf judg in my own ca&s;e, for I only, or &s;uch as I &s;hall con&s;ult, am fit to be the judg of it. He may be treacherous, and thro corruption or malice endeavour to poi&s;on me, or have other defects that render him unfit to be tru&s;ted: but I cannot by any corrupt pa&s;&s;ion be led wilfully to do him inju&s;tice, and if I mi&s;take, 'tis only to my own hurt. The like may be &s;aid of Lawyers, Stewards, Pilots, and gene|rally of all that do not act for them&s;elves, but for tho&s;e who employ them. And if a Company going to the <HI>Indys,</HI> &s;hould find that their Pilot was mad, drunk, or treacherous, they who&s;e lives and goods are concern'd, can only be fit to judg, whether he ought to be tru&s;ted or not, &s;ince he cannot have a right to de&s;troy tho&s;e he was cho&s;en to pre|&s;erve; and they cannot be thought to judg perver&s;ly, becau&s;e they have nothing to lead them but an opinion of truth, and cannot err but to their own prejudice. In the like manner, not only <HI>Solon</HI> and <HI>Draco,</HI> but <HI>Romulus, Numa, Ho&s;tilius,</HI> the Con&s;uls, Dictators and <HI>Decemviri,</HI> were not di&s;tingui&s;h'd from others, that it might be well with them, <HI>Sed ut bonum, faelix, fau&s;tum&abque; &s;it Populo Romano;</HI> but that the pro&s;|perity and happine&s;s of the People might be procur'd: which being the thing always intended, it were ab&s;urd to refer the judgment of the per|formance to him who is &s;u&s;pected of a de&s;ign to overthrow it, and who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, intere&s;ts, and vices, if he has any, lead him that way. If King <HI>James</HI> &s;aid any thing contrary to this, he might be an&s;wer'd with <NOTE PLACE="marg">Speech in Star-Chamber, <HI>1616.</HI></NOTE>&s;ome of his own words; <HI>I was,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>&s;worn to maintain the Laws of the Land, and therefore had bin perjur'd if I had broken them.</HI> It may al&s;o be pre&s;um'd, he had not forgotten what his Ma&s;ter <HI>Buchanan</HI> had taught <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;t. Scot.</NOTE>in the Books he wrote chiefly for his In&s;truction, that the violation of the Laws of <HI>Scotland</HI> could not have bin &s;o fatal to mo&s;t of his Predece&s;&s;ors, <NOTE PLACE="marg">De Jure Reg. apud Scot.</NOTE>Kings of that Country (nor as he him&s;elf had made them to his Mother) if Kings as Kings were above them.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XV. A general pre&s;umption that Kings will govern well, is not a &s;ufficient &s;ecurity to the People.</HEAD>
<P><HI>B&V;T,</HI> &s;ays our Author, <HI>yet will they rule their Subjects by the Law; and a King governing in a &s;ettled Kingdom, leaves to be a King, and degenerates into a Tyrant, &s;o &s;oon as he cea&s;es to rule according unto his Laws: Yet where he &s;ees them rigorous or doubtful, he may mitigate or inter|pret.</HI> This is therefore an effect of their goodne&s;s; they are above Laws, but will rule by Law, we have <HI>Filmer</HI>'s word for it. But I know not how Nations can be a&s;&s;ur'd their Princes will always be &s;o good: Good|ne&s;s is always accompany'd with Wi&s;dom, and I do not find tho&s;e admi|rable qualitys to be generally inherent or entail'd upon &s;upreme Magi|&s;trats. They do not &s;eem to be all alike, and we have not hitherto found them all to live in the &s;ame Spirit and Principle. I can &s;ee no re&s;em|blance between <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Caligula, Jo&s;hua</HI> and <HI>Claudius, Gideon</HI> and <HI>Nero, Sam&s;on</HI> and <HI>Vitellius, Samuel</HI> and <HI>Otho, David</HI> and <HI>Domitian;</HI> nor indeed between the be&s;t of the&s;e and their own Children. If the Sons of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> had bin like to them in wi&s;dom, valor and integrity, 'tis pro|bable
<PB N="287" REF="295">
they had bin cho&s;en to &s;ucceed them; if they were not, the like   is le&s;s to be pre&s;um'd of others. No man has yet ob&s;erv'd the Mode|ration of <HI>Gideon</HI> to have bin in <HI>Abimelech;</HI> the Piety of <HI>Eli</HI> in <HI>Hophni</HI> and <HI>Phineas;</HI> the Purity and Integrity of <HI>Samuel</HI> in <HI>Joel</HI> and <HI>Abiah,</HI> nor the Wi&s;dom of <HI>Solomon</HI> in <HI>Rehoboam.</HI> And if there was &s;o va&s;t a difference between them and their Children, who doubtle&s;s were in&s;tructed by tho&s;e excellent men in the ways of Wi&s;dom and Ju&s;tice, as well by Pre|cept as Example, were it not madne&s;s to be confident, that they who have neither precept nor good example to guide them, but on the con|trary are educated in an utter ignorance or abhorrence of all vertue, will always be ju&s;t and good; or to put the whole power into the hands of every man, woman, or child that &s;hall be born in governing Familys, upon a &s;uppo&s;ition, that a thing will happen which never did; or that the weake&s;t and wor&s;t will perform all that can be hop'd, and was &s;el|dom accompli&s;h'd by the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t, expo&s;ing whole Nations to be de&s;troy'd without remedy, if they do it not? And if this be madne&s;s in all extremity, 'tis to be pre&s;um'd that Nations never intended any &s;uch thing, unle&s;s our Author prove that all Nations have bin mad from the beginning, and mu&s;t always continue to be &s;o. To cure this, he &s;ays, <HI>They degenerate into Tyrants;</HI> and if he meant as he &s;peaks, it would be enough. For a King cannot degenerate into a Tyrant by departing from that Law which is only the product of his own will. But if he do degenerate, it mu&s;t be by departing from that which dos not depend upon his will, and is a rule pre&s;crib'd by a power that is above him. This indeed is the Doctrin of <HI>Bracton,</HI> who having &s;aid that the Power of the King is the Power of the Law, becau&s;e the Law makes him King, adds, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quia &s;i faciat injuriam, definit e&s;&s;e Rex, &amp; degenerat in tyrannum, &amp; fit vicarius Diaboli. <BIBL>Bract.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>That if he do inju&s;tice, he cea&s;es to be King, degenerates into a Tyrant, and becomes the Vicegerent of the Devil.</HI> But I hope this mu&s;t be under&s;tood with temperament, and a due con&s;ideration of human frailty, &s;o as to mean only tho&s;e injurys that are extreme; for otherwi&s;e he would terribly &s;hake all the Crowns of the World.</P>
<P>But le&s;t our Author &s;hould be thought once in his life to have dealt &s;in|cerely, and &s;poken truth, the next lines &s;hew the fraud of his la&s;t A&s;&s;er|tion, by giving to the Prince a power of <HI>mitigating or interpreting the Laws that he &s;ees to be rigorous or doubtful.</HI> But as he cannot degenerate into a Tyrant by departing from the Law which proceeds from his own will, &s;o he cannot mitigate or interpret that which proceeds from a &s;uperior Power, unle&s;s the right of mitigating or interpreting be con|fer'd upon him by the &s;ame. For as all wi&s;e men confe&s;s that <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cujus e&s;t in&s;tituere, ejus e&s;t abrogare.</NOTE><HI>none can abrogate but tho&s;e who may in&s;titute,</HI> and that all mitigation and interpre|tation varying from the true &s;en&s;e is an alteration, that alteration is an abrogation; for <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Quicquid mutatut di&s;&s;olvitur, interit ergo.</NOTE>what&s;oever is chang'd is di&s;&s;olv'd, and therefore the power of mitigating is in&s;eparable from that of in&s;tituting. This is &s;ufficiently evidenc'd by <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth's An&s;wer to the Speech made to him by the Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Commons 1545. in which he, tho one of the mo&s;t violent Princes we ever had, confe&s;&s;es the Parliament to be the Law-makers, and that an obligation lay upon him rightly to u&s;e the power with which he was entru&s;ted. The right therefore of altering
<PB N="288" REF="296">
  being in&s;eparable from that of making Laws, the one being in the Par|liament, the other mu&s;t be &s;o al&s;o. <HI>Forte&s;cue</HI> &s;ays plainly, the King cannot change any Law; <HI>Magna Charta</HI> ca&s;ts all upon <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leges terrae &amp; Con&s;uetudines Angliae.</NOTE>the Laws of the Land and Cu&s;toms of <HI>England:</HI> But to &s;ay that the King can by his will make that to be a Cu&s;tom, or an antient Law, which is not, or that not to be &s;o, which is, is mo&s;t ab&s;urd. He mu&s;t therefore take the Laws and Cu&s;toms as he finds them, and can neither detract from, nor add any thing to them. The ways are pre&s;crib'd as well as the end. Judgments are given by equals, <HI>per Pares.</HI> The Judges who may be a&s;&s;i&s;ting to tho&s;e, are &s;worn to proceed according to Law, and not to regard the King's Letters or Commands. The doubtful Ca&s;es are re|&s;erv'd, and to be refer'd to the Parliament, as in the Statute of 35 <HI>Edw.</HI> 3<HI>d</HI> concerning Trea&s;ons, but never to the King. The Law intending that the&s;e Parliaments &s;hould be annual, and leaving to the King a power of calling them more often if occa&s;ion require, takes away all pretence of a nece&s;&s;ity that there &s;hould be any other power to interpret or miti|gate Laws. For 'tis not to be imagin'd that there &s;hould be &s;uch a pe&s;tilent evil in any antient Law, Cu&s;tom, or later Act of Parliament, which being on the &s;udden di&s;cover'd, may not without any great pre|judice continue for forty days, till a Parliament may be call'd; whereas the force and e&s;&s;ence of all Laws would be &s;ubverted, if under color of mitigating and interpreting, the power of altering were allow'd to Kings, who often want the inclination, and for the mo&s;t part the capa|city of doing it rightly. 'Tis not therefore upon the uncertain will or under&s;tanding of a Prince, that the &s;afety of a Nation ought to depend. He is &s;ometimes a child, and &s;ometimes overburden'd with years. Some are weak, negligent, &s;lothful, fooli&s;h or vicious: others, who may have &s;omething of rectitude in their intentions, and naturally are not uncapable of doing well, are drawn out of the right way by the &s;ubtilty of ill men who gain credit with them. That rule mu&s;t always be un|certain, and &s;ubject to be di&s;torted, which depends upon the fancy of a man. He always fluctuates, and every pa&s;&s;ion that ari&s;es in his mind, or is infus'd by others, di&s;orders him. The good of a People ought to be e&s;tabli&s;h'd upon a more &s;olid foundation. For this rea&s;on the Law is e&s;tabli&s;h'd, which no pa&s;&s;ion can di&s;turb. 'Tis void of de&s;ire and fear, lu&s;t and anger. 'Tis <HI>Mens &s;ine affectu,</HI> written Rea&s;on, retaining &s;ome mea&s;ure of the Divine Perfection. It dos not enjoin that which plea&s;es a weak, frail man, but without any regard to per&s;ons commands that which is good, and puni&s;hes evil in all, whether rich or poor, high or low. 'Tis deaf, inexorable, inflexible.</P>
<P>By this means every man knows when he is &s;afe or in danger, becau&s;e he knows whether he has done good or evil. But if all depended upon the will of a man, the wor&s;t would be often the mo&s;t &s;afe, and the be&s;t in the greate&s;t hazard: Slaves would be often advanc'd, the good and the brave &s;corn'd and neglected. The mo&s;t generous Nations have above all things &s;ought to avoid this evil: and the vertue, wi&s;dom and genero&s;ity of each may be di&s;cern'd by the right fixing of the rule that mu&s;t be the guide of every man's life, and &s;o con&s;tituting their Magi|&s;tracy that it may be duly ob&s;erv'd. Such as have attain'd to this per|fection, have always flouri&s;h'd in vertue and happine&s;s: They are, as
<PB N="289" REF="297">
<HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> &s;ays, govern'd by God, rather than by men, whil&s;t tho&s;e who   &s;ubjected them&s;elves to the will of a man were govern'd by a bea&s;t.</P>
<P>This being &s;o, our Author's next clau&s;e, That <HI>tho a King do frame all his Actions to be according unto Law, yet he is not bound thereunto, but as his good will, and for good example, or &s;o far forth as the general Law for the &s;afety of the Commonwealth doth naturally bind him,</HI> is wholly im|pertinent. For if the King who governs not according to Law, de|generates into a Tyrant, he is oblig'd to frame his actions according to Law, or not to be a King; for a Tyrant is none, but as contrary to him, as the wor&s;t of men is to the be&s;t. But if the&s;e obligations were unty'd, we may ea&s;ily gue&s;s what &s;ecurity our Author's words can be to us, that the King of his own good will, and for a good example, will frame his actions according to the Laws; when experience in&s;tructs us, that not|with&s;tanding the &s;tricte&s;t Laws, and mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Con&s;titutions, that men of the be&s;t abilitys in the world could ever invent to re&s;train the irregular appetites of tho&s;e in power, with the dreadful examples of vengeance taken again&s;t &s;uch as would not be re&s;train'd, they have fre|quently broken out; and the mo&s;t powerful have for the mo&s;t part no otherwi&s;e di&s;tingui&s;h'd them&s;elves from the re&s;t of men, than by the enormity of their vices, and being the mo&s;t forward in leading others to all manner of crimes by their example.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XVI. The ob&s;ervation of the Laws of Nature is ab&s;urdly expected from Tyrants, who &s;et them&s;elves up again&s;t all Laws: and he that &s;ubjects Kings to no other Law than what is common to Tyrants, de&s;troys their being.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author's la&s;t clau&s;e, acknowledging Kings to be bound by a general Law to provide for the &s;afety of the People, would be &s;ufficient for my purpo&s;e if it were &s;incere; for municipal Laws do only &s;hew how that &s;hould be perform'd: and if the King by departing from that rule degenerates, as he &s;ays, into a Tyrant, 'tis ea&s;ily deter|min'd what ought then to be done by the People. But his whole Book being a heap of contradictions and frauds, we can rely upon nothing that he &s;ays: And his following words, which under the &s;ame Law comprehend both Kings and Tyrants, &s;hew that he intends Kings &s;hould be no otherwi&s;e oblig'd than Tyrants, which is, not at all. <HI>By this means,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>are all Kings, even Tyrants and Conquerors, bound to pre|&s;erve the Lands, Goods, Libertys and Lives of all their Subjects, not by any municipal Law of the Land, &s;o much as by the natural Law of a Father, which obligeth them to ratify the Acts of their Forefathers and Predece&s;&s;ors in things nece&s;&s;ary for the publick good of their Subjects.</HI> If he be therefore in the right, Tyrants and Conquerors are Kings and Fathers. The words that have bin always thought to comprehend the mo&s;t irreconcila|ble contrariety, the one expre&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t tender love and care, evi|dently te&s;tify'd by the greate&s;t obligations confer'd upon tho&s;e who are under it; the other the utmo&s;t of all injurys that can be offer'd to men, &s;ignify the &s;ame thing: There is no difference between a Magi&s;trate who
<PB N="290" REF="298">
  is what he is by Law, and a publick Enemy, who by force or fraud &s;ets him&s;elf up again&s;t all Law: And what he &s;aid before, that Kings degene|rated into Tyrants, &s;ignifys nothing, for Tyrants al&s;o are Kings.</P>
<P>His next words are no le&s;s incomprehen&s;ible; for neither King nor Ty|rant can be oblig'd to pre&s;erve the Lands, Goods and Libertys of their Subjects if they have none. But as Liberty con&s;i&s;ts only in being &s;ubject to no man's will, and nothing denotes a Slave but a dependence upon the will of another; if there be no other Law in a Kingdom than the will of a Prince, there is no &s;uch thing as Liberty. Property al&s;o is an ap|pendage to Liberty; and 'tis as impo&s;&s;ible for a man to have a right to Lands or Goods, if he has no Liberty, and enjoys his Life only at the plea&s;ure of another, as it is to enjoy either when he is depriv'd of 'em. He therefore who &s;ays Kings and Tyrants are bound to pre&s;erve their Subjects Lands, Libertys, Goods and Lives, and yet lays for a foundation, that Laws are no more than the &s;ignifications of their Plea&s;ure, &s;eeks to delude the world with words which &s;ignify nothing.</P>
<P>The vanity of the&s;e Whim&s;ys will farther appear, if it be con&s;ider'd, that as Kings are Kings by Law, and Tyrants are Tyrants by overthrowing the Law, they are mo&s;t ab&s;urdly join'd together; and 'tis not more ridi|culous to &s;et him above the Law, who is what he is by the Law, than to expect the ob&s;ervation of the Laws that enjoin the pre&s;ervation of the Lands, Libertys, Goods and Lives of the People, from one who by fraud or violence makes him&s;elf ma&s;ter of all, that he may be re&s;train'd by no Law, and is what he is by &s;ubverting all Law.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, if the <HI>&s;afety of the People</HI> be <HI>the &s;upreme Law,</HI> and this &s;afety extend to, and con&s;i&s;t in the pre&s;ervation of their Libertys, Goods, Lands and Lives, that Law mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the root and beginning, as well as the end and limit of all magi&s;tratical Power, and all Laws mu&s;t be &s;ub&s;ervient and &s;ubordinate to it. The que&s;tion will not then be what plea|&s;es the King, but what is good for the People; not what conduces to his profit or glory, but what be&s;t &s;ecures the Libertys he is bound to pre&s;erve: he dos not therefore reign for him&s;elf, but for the People; he is not the Ma&s;ter, but the Servant of the Commonwealth; and the utmo&s;t extent of his Prerogative is to be able to do more good than any private Man. If this be his work and duty, 'tis ea&s;ily &s;een whether he is to judg of his own performance, or they by whom and for whom he reigns; and whether in order to this he be to give Laws, or to receive them. 'Tis or|dinarily &s;aid in <HI>France, Il faut que chacun &s;oit &s;ervi &agrave; &s;a mode;</HI> Every man's bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t be done according to his own mind: and if this be true in particular Per&s;ons, 'tis more plainly &s;o in whole Nations. Many eyes &s;ee more than one: the collected wi&s;dom of a People much &s;urpa&s;&s;es that of a &s;ingle Per&s;on; and tho he &s;hould truly &s;eek that which is be&s;t, 'tis not probable he would &s;o ea&s;ily find it, as the body of a Nation, or the principal men cho&s;en to repre&s;ent the whole. This may be &s;aid with ju&s;tice of the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t Princes that ever were; but another Lan|guage is to be us'd when we &s;peak of tho&s;e who may &s;ucceed, and who very often, thro the defects of Age, Per&s;on, or Sex, are neither fit to judg of other mens affairs, nor of their own; and are &s;o far from being ca|pable of the highe&s;t Concernments relating to the &s;afety of whole Na|tions, that the mo&s;t trivial cannot rea&s;onably be refer'd to them.</P>
<P>There are few men (except &s;uch as <HI>Filmer,</HI> who by bidding defiance to the Laws of God and Man, &s;eems to declare war again&s;t both) whom I would not tru&s;t to determin whether a People, that can never fall into
<PB N="291" REF="299">
Nonage or Dotage, and can never fail of having men of Wi&s;dom and   Vertue among&s;t 'em, be not more fit to judg in their own Per&s;ons, or by Repre&s;entatives, what conduces to their own good, than one who at a venture may be born in a certain Family, and who, be&s;ides his own Infir|mitys, Pa&s;&s;ions, Vices, or Intere&s;ts, is continually &s;urrounded by &s;uch as endeavour to divert him from the ways of Truth and Ju&s;tice. And if no rea&s;onable man dare prefer the latter before the former, we mu&s;t rely up|on the Laws made by our Forefathers, and interpreted by the Nation, and not upon the will of a man.</P>
<P>'Tis in vain to &s;ay that a wi&s;e and good Council may &s;upply the defects, or correct the Vices of a young, fooli&s;h, or ill di&s;pos'd King. For <HI>Filmer</HI> denys that a King, whatever he be without exception, (for he attributes profound wi&s;dom to all) is oblig'd to follow the advice of his Council; and even he him&s;elf would hardly have had the impudence to &s;ay, That good Coun&s;el given to a fooli&s;h or wicked Prince were of any value, unle&s;s he were oblig'd to follow it. This Council mu&s;t be cho&s;en by him, or impos'd upon him: if it be impos'd upon him, it mu&s;t be by a Power that is above him, which he &s;ays cannot be. If cho&s;en by one who is weak, fooli&s;h, or wicked, it can never be good; becau&s;e &s;uch vertue and wi&s;dom is requir'd to di&s;cern and chu&s;e a few good and wi&s;e men, from a multitude of fooli&s;h and bad, as he has not. And it will generally fall out, that he will take for his Coun&s;ellors rather tho&s;e he believes to be addicted to his Per&s;on or Intere&s;ts, than &s;uch as are fitly qualify'd to perform the duty of their places. But if he &s;hould by chance, or contrary to his intentions, make choice of &s;ome good and wi&s;e men, the matter would not be much mended, for they will certainly differ in opinion from the wor&s;t. And tho the Prince &s;hould intend well, of which there is no a&s;&s;urance, nor any rea&s;on to put &s;o great a power into his hands if there be none; 'tis almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for him to avoid the &s;nares that will be laid to &s;educe him. I know not how to put a better face upon this mat|ter: for if I examin rather what is probable than po&s;&s;ible, fooli&s;h or ill Princes will never chu&s;e &s;uch as are wi&s;e and good; but favouring tho&s;e who are mo&s;t like to them&s;elves, will prefer &s;uch as &s;econd their vices, humors, and per&s;onal Intere&s;ts, and by &s;o doing will rather fortify and rivet the evils that are brought upon the Nation thro their defects, than cure them. This was evident in <HI>Rehoboam:</HI> he had good Coun&s;el, but he would not hearken to it. We know too many of the &s;ame &s;ort; and tho it were not impo&s;&s;ible (as <HI>Machiavelli</HI> &s;ays it is) for a weak Prince to receive any benefit from a good Council, we may certainly conclude, that a People can never expect any good from a Council cho&s;en by one who is weak or vicious.</P>
<P>If a Council be impos'd upon him, and he be oblig'd to follow their ad|vice, it mu&s;t be impos'd by a Power that is above him; his Will there|fore is not a Law, but mu&s;t be regulated by the Law: the Monarchy is not above the Law; and if we will believe our Author, 'tis no Monarchy, becau&s;e the Monarch has not his will, and perhaps he &s;ays true. For if that be an Ari&s;tocracy, where tho&s;e that are, or are reputed to be the be&s;t do govern, then that is certainly a mix'd State, in which the will of one man dos not prevail. But if Princes are not oblig'd by the Law, all that is founded upon that &s;uppo&s;ition falls to the ground: They will always follow their own humors, or the &s;ugge&s;tions of tho&s;e who &s;econd them. <HI>Tiberius</HI> hearken'd to none but <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> or the mini&s;ters of his impu|ritys and crueltys: <HI>Claudius</HI> was govern'd by Slaves, and the profligate
<PB N="292" REF="300">
  Strumpets his Wives. There were many wi&s;e and good men in the Se|nat during the reigns of <HI>Caligula, Nero,</HI> and <HI>Domitian;</HI> but in&s;tead of following their Coun&s;el, they endeavour'd to de&s;troy them all, le&s;t they &s;hould head the People again&s;t them; and &s;uch Princes as re&s;emble them will always follow the like cour&s;es.</P>
<P>If I often repeat the&s;e hateful names, 'tis not for want of fre&s;her exam|ples of the &s;ame nature; but I chu&s;e &s;uch as Mankind has univer&s;ally condemn'd, again&s;t whom I can have no other cau&s;e of hatred than what is common to all tho&s;e who have any love to vertue, and which can have no other relation to the Controver&s;ys of later Ages, than what may flow from the &s;imilitude of their cau&s;es, rather than &s;uch as are too well known to us, and which every man, according to the mea&s;ure of his experience, may call to mind in reading the&s;e. I may al&s;o add, that as nothing is to be receiv'd as a general Maxim, which is not generally true, I need no more to overthrow &s;uch as <HI>Filmer</HI> propo&s;es, than to prove how frequently they have bin found fal&s;e, and what de&s;perate mi&s;chiefs have bin brought upon the World as often as they have bin practis'd, and exce&s;&s;ive Powers put into the hands of &s;uch as had neither inclination nor ability to make a good u&s;e of them: And therefore,</P>
<P>1. If the &s;afety of Nations be the end for which Governments are in|&s;tituted, &s;uch as take upon them to govern, by what Title &s;oever, are by the Law of Nature bound to procure it; and in order to this, to pre&s;erve the Lives, Lands, Libertys and Goods of every one of their Subjects: and he that upon any title what&s;oever pretends, a&s;&s;umes, or exerci&s;es a power of di&s;po&s;ing of them according to his own will, violates the Laws of Nature in the highe&s;t degree.</P>
<P>2. If all Princes are oblig'd by the Law of Nature to pre&s;erve the Lands, Goods, Lives and Libertys of their Subjects, tho&s;e Subjects have by the Law of Nature a right to their Libertys, Lands, Goods, &amp;c. and cannot depend upon the will of any man, for that dependance de&s;troys Liberty, &amp;c.</P>
<P>3. Ill men will not, and weak men cannot provide for the &s;afety of the People; nay the work is of &s;uch extreme difficulty, that the greate&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t men that have bin in the world are not able by them&s;elves to per|form it; and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Coun&s;el is of no u&s;e, unle&s;s Princes are oblig'd to follow it. There mu&s;t be therefore a power in every State to re&s;train the ill, and to in&s;truct weak Princes by obliging them to follow the Coun&s;els given, el&s;e the ends of Government cannot be accompli&s;h'd, nor the rights of Nations pre&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>All this being no more than what is &s;aid by our Author, or nece&s;&s;arily to be deduc'd from his Propo&s;itions, one would think he were become as good a Commonwealths-man as <HI>Cato;</HI> but the wa&s;h'd Swine will return to the Mire. He overthrows all by a prepo&s;terous conjunction of the rights of Kings which are ju&s;t and by Law, with tho&s;e of Tyrants which are utterly again&s;t Law; and gives the &s;acred and gentle name of Father to tho&s;e Bea&s;ts, who by their actions declare them&s;elves enemys not only to all Law and Ju&s;tice, but to Mankind that cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without them. This requires no other proof, than to examin whether <HI>Attila</HI> or <HI>Tamerlan</HI> did well de&s;erve to be call'd Fathers of the Countrys they de&s;troy'd. The fir&s;t of the&s;e was u&s;ually call'd the &s;courge of God, and he glory'd in the Name. The other being reprov'd for the dete&s;table crueltys he <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 line">.</NOTE>exercis'd, made an&s;wer, <HI>You &s;peak to me as to a man; I am not a man, but the &s;courge of God and plague of Mankind.</HI> This is certainly &s;weet and
<PB N="293" REF="301">
gentle Language, &s;avouring much of a fatherly tenderne&s;s: There is no   doubt that tho&s;e who u&s;e it will provide for the &s;afety of the Nations un|der them, and the pre&s;ervation of the Laws of Nature is rightly refer'd to them; and 'tis al&s;o very probable, that they who come to burn the Countrys, and de&s;troy the Nations that fall under their power, &s;hould make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to pre&s;erve them, and look upon the former Gover|nors <HI>as their Fathers, who&s;e Acts they are oblig'd to confirm,</HI> tho they &s;eldom attain to the Dominion by any other means than the &s;laughter of them and their Familys.</P>
<P>But if the enmity be not again&s;t the Nation, and the cau&s;e of the war be only for Dominion again&s;t the ruling Per&s;on or Family, as that of <HI>Baa&s;ha</HI> again&s;t the hou&s;e of <HI>Jeroboam,</HI> of <HI>Zimri</HI> again&s;t that of <HI>Baa&s;ha,</HI> of <HI>Omri</HI> again&s;t <HI>Zimri,</HI> and of <HI>Jehu</HI> again&s;t <HI>Joram,</HI> the pro&s;ecution of it is a &s;trange way of becoming the Son of the Per&s;on de&s;troy'd. And <HI>Filmer</HI> alone is &s;ubtil enough to di&s;cover, that <HI>Jehu</HI> by extingui&s;hing the hou&s;e of <HI>Ahab,</HI> drew an obligation upon him&s;elf, of looking on him as his Father, and confirming his acts. If this be true, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was oblig'd to confirm the acts of the Kings of the <HI>Amalekites, Moabites</HI> and <HI>Amo|rites</HI> that he de&s;troy'd; the &s;ame duty lay upon <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> in relation to the <HI>Canaanites:</HI> but 'tis not &s;o ea&s;ily decided, to which of them he did owe that deference; for the &s;ame could not be due to all, and 'tis hard to be|lieve, that by killing above thirty Kings, he &s;hould purcha&s;e to him&s;elf &s;o many Fathers; and the like may be &s;aid of divers others.</P>
<P>Moreover, there is a &s;ort of Tyrant who has no Father, as <HI>Agathocles, Dio|ny&s;ius, Ce&s;ar,</HI> and generally all tho&s;e who &s;ubvert the Libertys of their own Country. And if they &s;tood oblig'd to look upon the former Magi&s;trats as their Predece&s;&s;ors, and to confirm their Acts, the fir&s;t &s;hould have bin to give impunity and reward to any that would kill them, it having bin a fundamental Maxim in tho&s;e States, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Uni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ui&abque; licere Tyrannum occidere.</NOTE><HI>That any man might kill a Tyrant.</HI></P>
<P>This being in all re&s;pects ridiculous and ab&s;urd, 'tis evident that our Author, who by propo&s;ing &s;uch a fal&s;e &s;ecurity to Nations for their Liber|tys, endeavours to betray them, is not le&s;s treacherous to Kings, when under a pretence of defending their Rights, he makes them to be the &s;ame with tho&s;e of Tyrants, who are known to have none (and are Tyrants becau&s;e they have none) and gives no other hopes to Nations of being pre&s;erv'd by the Kings they &s;et up for that end, than what upon the &s;ame account may be expected from Tyrants, whom all wi&s;e men have ever abhor'd, and affirm'd to have bin <HI>produc'd</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In generis humani exitium natos.</NOTE><HI>to bring de&s;truction upon the World,</HI> and who&s;e Lives have verify'd the Sentence.</P>
<P>This is truly to depo&s;e and aboli&s;h Kings, by aboli&s;hing that by which and for which they are &s;o. The greatne&s;s of their Power, Riches, State, and the plea&s;ures that accompany them cannot but create enemys. Some will envy that which is accounted Happine&s;s; others may di&s;like the u&s;e they make of their Power: &s;ome may be unju&s;tly exa&s;perated by the be&s;t of their Actions when they find them&s;elves incommoded by them; others may be too &s;evere judges of &s;light mi&s;carriages. The&s;e things may rea|&s;onably temper the joys of tho&s;e who delight mo&s;t in the advantages of Crowns. But the wor&s;t and mo&s;t dangerous of all their enemys are the&s;e accur&s;ed Sycophants, who, by making tho&s;e that ought to be the be&s;t of men, like to the wor&s;t, de&s;troy their Being; and by per&s;uading the world they aim at the &s;ame things, and are bound to no other rule than is com|mon to all Tyrants, give a fair pretence to ill men to &s;ay, They are all of
<PB N="294" REF="302">
  one kind. And if this &s;hould be receiv'd for truth, even they who think the mi&s;carriages of their Governors may be ea&s;ily redre&s;t, and de&s;ire no more, would be the mo&s;t fierce in procuring the de&s;truction of that which is naught in Principle, and cannot be corrected.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XVII. Kings cannot be the Interpreters of the Oaths they take.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author's Book is &s;o full of ab&s;urditys and contradictions, that it would be a rope of Sand, if a continu'd &s;eries of frauds did not, like a &s;tring of Poi&s;ons running thro the whole, give it &s;ome con&s;i&s;t|ence with it &s;elf, and &s;hew it to be the work of one and the &s;ame hand. After having endeavour'd to &s;ubvert the Laws of God, Nature and Na|tions, mo&s;t e&s;pecially our own, by abu&s;ing the Scriptures, fal&s;ly alledging the Authority of many good Writers, and &s;eeking to obtrude upon Man|kind a univer&s;al Law, that would take from every Nation the right of con&s;tituting &s;uch Governments within them&s;elves as &s;eem mo&s;t convenient for them, and giving rules for the admini&s;tration of &s;uch as they had e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd, he gives us a full view of his Religion and Morals, by de&s;troying the force of the Oath taken by our Kings at their Coronation. <HI>Others,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>affirm, that altho Laws of them&s;elves do not bind Kings, yet the Oaths of Kings at their Coronation ty them to keep all the Laws of their King|doms. How far this is true, let us but examin the Oath of the Kings of</HI> Eng|land <HI>at their Coronation, the words whereof are the&s;e. Art thou pleas'd to cau&s;e to be admini&s;ter'd in all thy judgments, indifferent and upright Ju&s;tice, and to u&s;e di&s;cretion with Mercy and Verity? Art thou pleas'd that our up|right Laws and Cu&s;toms be ob&s;erv'd, and do&s;t thou promi&s;e that tho&s;e &s;hall be protected and maintain'd by thee?</HI> &amp;c. To which the King <HI>an&s;wers in the Affirmative, being fir&s;t demanded by the Archbi&s;hop of</HI> Canterbury, <HI>Plea&s;eth it you to confirm and ob&s;erve the Laws and Cu&s;toms of the antient times, granted from God by ju&s;t and devout Kings unto the Engli&s;h Nation, by Oath unto the &s;aid People, e&s;pecially the Laws, Libertys and Cu&s;toms granted unto the Clergy and Laity by the famous King</HI> Edward? From this he infers, That the King <HI>is not to ob&s;erve all Laws, but &s;uch as are upright, becau&s;e he finds evil Laws mention'd in the Oath of</HI> Richard <HI>the</HI> 2d, <HI>which he &s;wears to aboli&s;h: Now what Laws are upright and what evil, who &s;hall judg but the King? &amp;c. So that in effect the King doth &s;wear to keep no Laws but &s;uch as in his judgment are upright, &amp;c.

But fir&s;t I &s;hall take leave to remark, that tho&s;e who for private intere&s;ts   addict them&s;elves to the per&s;onal &s;ervice of Princes, tho to the ruin of their Country, find it impo&s;&s;ible to per&s;uade Mankind that Kings may govern as they plea&s;e, when all men know there are Laws to direct and re&s;train them, unle&s;s they can make men believe they have their power from a univer&s;al and &s;uperior Law; or that Princes can attempt to di&s;&s;olve the obligations laid upon them by the Laws, which they &s;o &s;olemnly &s;wear to ob&s;erve, without rendring them&s;elves dete&s;table to God and Man, and &s;ubject to the revenging hands of both, unle&s;s they can invalidate tho&s;e Oaths. Mr. <HI>Hobbes</HI> I think was the fir&s;t, who very ingeniou&s;ly contriv'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. de Cive&punc;</NOTE>a compendious way of ju&s;tifying the mo&s;t abominable Perjurys, and all the mi&s;chiefs en&s;uing thereupon, by pretending, that as the King's Oath is made to the People, the People may ab&s;olve him from the obligation; and that the People having confer'd upon him all the Power they had, he can do all that they could: he can therefore ab&s;olve him&s;elf, and is actu|ally free, &s;ince he is &s;o when he plea&s;es. This is only fal&s;e in the minor: for the People not having confer'd upon him all, but only a part of their Power, that of ab&s;olving him remains in them&s;elves, otherwi&s;e they would never have oblig'd him to take the Oath. He cannot therefore ab&s;olve him&s;elf. The Pope indeed finds a help for this, and as Chri&s;t's Vicar pretends the power of Ab&s;olution to be in him, and exercis'd it in ab|&s;olving K. <HI>John.</HI> But our Author de&s;pairing to impo&s;e either of the&s;e up|on our Age and Nation, with more impudence and le&s;s wit, would ener|vate all Coronation-Oaths by &s;ubjecting them to the di&s;cretion of the taker; whereas all men have hitherto thought their force to con&s;i&s;t in the declar'd &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e who give them. This doctrin is &s;o new, that it &s;urpa&s;&s;es the &s;ubtilty of the Schoolmen, who, as an ingenious Per&s;on &s;aid of 'em, had minc'd Oaths &s;o fine, that a million of 'em, as well as Angels, may &s;tand upon the point of a needle; and were never yet equal'd but by the Je&s;uits, who have overthrown them by mental re&s;ervations; which is &s;o clearly demon&s;trated from their books, that it cannot be deny'd, but &s;o horrible, that even tho&s;e of their own Order who have the lea&s;t &s;park of common hone&s;ty condemn the practice. And one of them, being a Gentleman of a good family, told me, he would go the next day and take all the Oaths that &s;hould be offer'd, if he could &s;atisfy his con&s;cience in u&s;ing any manner of equivocation or mental re&s;ervation, that he might put any other &s;en&s;e upon them, than he knew to be intend|ed by tho&s;e who offer'd them. And if our Author's con&s;cience were not more corrupted than that of the Je&s;uit, who had liv'd fi&s;ty years under the wor&s;t Di&s;ciplin that I think ever was in the world, I would ask him &s;eriou&s;ly, if he truly believe, that the Nobility, Clergy and Commonal|ty o&s; <HI>England,</HI> who have bin always &s;o zealous for their antient Laws, and &s;o re&s;olute in defending 'em, did mean no more by the Oaths they &s;o &s;olemnly impos'd, and upon which they laid &s;o much weight, than that the King &s;hould &s;wear to keep 'em, &s;o far only as he &s;hould think fit.</P>

How can that be under&s;tood otherwi&s;e than that tho&s;e who give the Oath, do declare their Laws and Cu&s;toms to be upright and good, and he by taking the Oath affirms them to be &s;o?

<P><HI>Magna Charta</HI> being only an abridgment of our antient Laws and Cu&s;toms, the King that &s;wears to it, &s;wears to them all; and not being admitted to be the interpreter of it, or to determin what is good or evil, fit to be ob&s;erv'd or annul'd in it, can have no more power over the re&s;t. This having bin confirm'd by more Parliaments than we have had Kings &s;ince that time, the &s;ame obligation mu&s;t &s;till lie upon them all, as upon <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Henry,</HI> in who&s;e time that claim of right was compil'd. The Act was no le&s;s &s;olemn than important; and the mo&s;t dreadful cur&s;es that could be conceiv'd in words, which were denounc'd again&s;t &s;uch as &s;hould any way infringe it, by the Clergy in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI> in the pre&s;ence and with the a&s;&s;ent of K. <HI>Henry</HI> III. many of the principal Nobility, and all the E&s;tates of the Kingdom, &s;hew whether it was refer'd to the King's Judg|ment or not; when 'tis evident they fear'd the violation from no other than him&s;elf, and &s;uch as he &s;hould employ. I confe&s;s the Church (as they then call'd the Clergy) was fallen into &s;uch corruption, that their Arms were not much to be fear'd by one who had his con&s;cience clear; but that could not be in the ca&s;e of perjury: and our Ance&s;tors could do no better, than to imploy the &s;piritual &s;word, re&s;erving to them&s;elves the u&s;e of the other in ca&s;e that &s;hould be de&s;pis'd. Tho the Pope's Excommunications prov'd &s;ometimes to be but <HI>bruta fulmina,</HI> when a ju&s;t cau&s;e was want|ing, it may be ea&s;ily judg'd what obedience a Prince could expect from his Subjects, when every man knew he had by perjury drawn the mo&s;t heavy cur&s;es upon him&s;elf. K. <HI>John</HI> was certainly wicked, but he dur&s;t not break the&s;e bonds till he had procur'd the Pope's ab&s;olution for a cover; and when he had done &s;o, he found him&s;elf un&s;afe under it, and could not make good what he had promis'd to the Pope to obtain it, the Parliament declaring that his grants to the Pope were unju&s;t, illegal, contrary to his Coronation-Oath, and that they would not be held by them. This went &s;o far in that King's time, that Writs were i&s;&s;ued out to men of all con|ditions to oblige them&s;elves by oath to keep the great Charter; and if o|ther means &s;ail'd, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Er quod ip&s;um Regem per captionem di&s;tringerent &amp; gravarent ad prafata exequenda.</NOTE><HI>to compel the King to perform the conditions.</HI> 'Tis ex|pre&s;ly &s;aid in his Charter, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Et ip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> Barones cum Communitate totius terra di&s;tringent &amp; gravabunt nos modis omnibus qui|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">us poterunt, &s;ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">cet per captionem ca&s;trorum, terrarum, po&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ionum, &amp; aliis modis quibus potuerint, don<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> emendatum <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">uerit &s;ecundum arbitrium cor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">m.</NOTE><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the Barons and Commonalty of the land &s;hall &s;traiten and compel us by all means po&s;&s;ible, as by &s;eiz|ing our Towns, Lands, and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, or any other way, till &s;ati&s;|faction be made according to their plea&s;ure."</Q> And in the Charter of his Son <HI>Henry,</HI> 'tis, upon the &s;ame &s;uppo&s;ition of not performing the agree|ment, &s;aid, <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Licet omnibus de regno no&s;tro contra no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;urg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">re, &amp; omni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ere qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> gravamen no&s;trum re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">piciant&punc; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> nobi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n nul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> ten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rentur.</NOTE><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It &s;hall be lawful for all men in our Kingdom to ri&s;e up again&s;t us, and to do all things that may be grievous to us, as if they were ab&s;olutely free from any engagements to our per&s;on."</Q> The&s;e words &s;eem to have bin contriv'd to be &s;o full and &s;trong <HI>propter duplicita|tem Regis,</HI> which was with too much rea&s;on &s;u&s;pected.

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But, &s;ays our Author, Kings cannot be more oblig'd by voluntary Oaths than other men, and may be reliev'd from unju&s;t and unrea&s;onable promi&s;es, if they be induc'd by deceit, error, force or fear, or the performance be grievous."</Q> Which is to &s;ay, that no Oath is of any obli|gation: for there is none that is not voluntary or involuntary, and there never was any upon which &s;ome &s;uch thing may not be pretended, which would be the &s;ame if &s;uch as <HI>Filmer</HI> had the direction of their con&s;ciences who take the Oaths, and of tho&s;e who are to exact the performance. This would &s;oon de&s;troy all confidence between King and People, and not only unhinge the be&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h'd Governments, but by a dete&s;table practice of annihilating the force of Oaths and mo&s;t &s;olemn Contracts that can be made by men, overthrow all Societys that &s;ub&s;i&s;t by them. I leave it to all rea&s;onable men to judg how fit a work this would be for the &s;upreme Magi&s;trate, who is advanc'd to the highe&s;t degree of human glory and happine&s;s, that he may pre&s;erve them; and how that Ju&s;tice, for the obtaining of which Governments are con&s;tituted, can be admi|ni&s;ter'd, if he who is to exact it from others, dos in his own per&s;on ut|terly &s;ubvert it; and what they de&s;erve, who by &s;uch ba&s;e prevarica|tions would teach 'em to pervert and aboli&s;h the mo&s;t &s;acred of all Con|tracts. A worthy per&s;on of our Age was accu&s;tom'd to &s;ay that Con|tracts in writing were invented only to bind Villains, who having no Law, Ju&s;tice or Truth within them&s;elves, would not keep their words, unle&s;s &s;uch te&s;timonys were given as might compel them. But if our Author's Doctrin were receiv'd, no contract would be of more value than a Cobweb. Such as are not ab&s;olutely of a profligate con&s;cience, &s;o far reverence the religion of an Oath, to think that even tho&s;e which are mo&s;t unju&s;tly and violently impos'd, ought to be ob&s;erv'd; and <HI>Julius Ce&s;ar,</HI> who I think was not over-&s;crupulous, when he was taken by Py|rats, and &s;et at liberty upon his word, caus'd the Ran&s;om he had promis'd to be paid to them. We &s;ee the like is practis'd every day by Pri&s;oners taken in unju&s;t as well as ju&s;t Wars: And there is no hone&s;t man that would not abhor a Per&s;on, who being taken by the Pyrats of <HI>Algier</HI> &s;hould not pay what he had promis'd for his Liberty. 'Twere in vain to &s;ay they had no right of exacting, or that the performance was grievous; he mu&s;t return to the chains, or pay. And tho the People of <HI>Artois, Al|&s;atia,</HI> or <HI>Flanders,</HI> do perhaps with rea&s;on think the King of <HI>France</HI> has no right to impo&s;e Oaths of Allegiance upon them, no man doubts, that if they chu&s;e rather to take tho&s;e Oaths, than to &s;uffer what might en&s;ue upon their refu&s;al, they are as much bound to be faithful to him as his an|tient Subjects.</P>
<P>The like may be &s;aid of promi&s;es extorted by fraud; and no other example is nece&s;&s;ary to prove they are to be perform'd than that of <HI>Jo|&s;hua</HI>
<PB N="298" REF="306">
  made to the <HI>Gibeonites.</HI> They were an accur&s;ed Nation, which he was commanded to de&s;troy: They came to him with lies, and by deceit induc'd him to make a League with them, which he ought not to have done; but being made, it was to be perform'd, and on that account he did not only &s;pare but defend them, and the action was approv'd by God. When <HI>Saul</HI> by a prepo&s;terous zeal violated that League, the Anger of God for that breach of faith could no otherwi&s;e be appeas'd than by the death of &s;even of his Children. This ca&s;e is &s;o full, &s;o preci&s;e, and of &s;uch undoubted authority, that I &s;hall not trouble my &s;elf with any o|ther. But if we believe our man of good morals, voluntary Oaths and Promi&s;es are of no more value than tho&s;e gain'd by force or deceit, that is to &s;ay, none are of any. For voluntary &s;ignifying nothing but free, all human Acts are either free or not free, that is, from the will of the per&s;on, or &s;ome impul&s;e from without. If therefore there be no force in tho&s;e that are free, nor in tho&s;e that are not free, there is none in any.</P>
<P>No better u&s;e can be made of any <HI>preten&s;ion of error,</HI> or that the <HI>per|formance was grievous;</HI> for no man ought to be griev'd at the performance of his Contract. <HI>David</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, that a good man performs his agree|ment tho he lo&s;e by it; and the Lord Chancellor <HI>Egerton</HI> told a Gentle|man, who de&s;ir'd relief again&s;t his own Deed, upon an Allegation that he knew not what he did when he &s;ign'd it, that he did not &s;it to relieve fools.</P>
<P>But tho voluntary Promi&s;es or Oaths, when, to u&s;e the Lawyers lan|guage, there is not a valuable con&s;ideration, were of no obligation; or that men brought by force, fear or error, into &s;uch Contracts as are grie|vous in the performance, might be reliev'd; this would not at all reach the ca&s;es of Princes, in the Contracts made between them and their Sub|jects, and confirm'd by their Oaths, there being no color of force or fraud, fear or error for them to alledg; nor any thing to be pretended that can be grievous to perform, otherwi&s;e than as it may be grievous to an ill man not to do the mi&s;chiefs he had conceiv'd.</P>
<P>Nations according to their own will frame the Laws by which they re&s;olve to be govern'd; and if they do it not wi&s;ely, the damage i only to them&s;elves. But 'tis hard to find an example of any People that did by force oblige a man to take upon him the Government of them. <HI>Gideon</HI> was indeed much pre&s;s'd by the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> to be their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ing; and the Army of <HI>Germanicus</HI> in a Mutiny more fiercely urg'd him to be Emperor; but both de&s;i&s;ted when their Offers were refus'd. If our Kings have bin more mode&s;t, and our Ance&s;tors more pertinacious in compelling them to ac|cept the Crowns they offer'd, I &s;hall upon proof of the matter change my opinion. But till that do appear, I may be pardon'd if I think there was no &s;uch thing. <HI>William</HI> the <HI>Norman</HI> was not by force brought into <HI>Eng|land,</HI> but came voluntarily, and de&s;ir'd to be King: The Nobility, Cler|gy, and Commons propos'd the Conditions upon which they would re|ceive him. The&s;e conditions were to govern according to their antient Laws, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that had bin granted, or rather collected in the time of the famous King <HI>Edward.</HI> Here was neither force nor fraud; i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> he had di&s;lik'd the terms, he might have retir'd as freely as he came.

Here was therefore no force, deceit or error; and what&s;oever equity there might be to relieve one that had bin forc'd, frighted or circumvented, it was nothing to this ca&s;e. We do not find that <HI>William</HI> the 2<HI>d,</HI> or <HI>Henry,</HI> were forc'd to be Kings; no Sword was put to their Throats; and for any thing we know, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation was not then &s;o contemptible but men might have bin found in the world, who would willingly have accepted the Crown, and even their elder Brother <HI>Robert</HI> would not have refus'd: but the Nobility and Commons tru&s;ting to their Oaths and Pro|mi&s;es, thought fit to prefer them before him; and when he endeavour'd to impo&s;e him&s;elf upon the Nation by force, they &s;o &s;everely puni&s;h'd him, that no better proof can be requir'd to &s;hew they were accu&s;|tom'd to have no other Kings than &s;uch as they approv'd. And this was one of the Cu&s;toms that all their Kings &s;wore to maintain, it being as antient, ju&s;t, and well approv'd as any other.</P>
<P>Having already prov'd, that all the Kings we have had &s;ince that time, have come in upon the &s;ame title; that the <HI>Saxon</HI> Laws to which all have &s;worn, continue to be of force among&s;t us, and that the words pronounc'd four times on the four &s;ides of the Scaffold by the Archbi&s;hop, <HI>Will ye have this Man to reign?</HI> do te&s;tify it; I may &s;pare the pains of a repetition, and ju&s;tly conclude, That if there was neither force nor fraud, fear nor error, to be pretended by the fir&s;t, there could be none in tho&s;e that fol|low'd.</P>
<P>But the <HI>ob&s;ervation of this Oath may be grievous.</HI> If I receiv'd mony the la&s;t year upon Bond, Promi&s;e, or &s;ale of a Mannor or Farm, can it be thought grievous to me to be compel'd to repay, or make over the Land according to my agreement? Or if I did not &s;eal the Bond till I had the mony, mu&s;t not I perform the condition, or at the lea&s;t re&s;tore what I had receiv'd? If it be grievous to any King to pre&s;erve the Libertys, Lives, and E&s;tates of his Subjects, and to govern according to their Laws, let him re&s;ign the Crown, and the People to whom the Oath was made, will probably relea&s;e him. Others may po&s;&s;ibly be found who will not think it grievous: or if none will accept a Crown unle&s;s they may do what they plea&s;e, the People mu&s;t bear the misfortune of being oblig'd to govern them&s;elves, or to in&s;titute &s;ome other &s;ort of Magi&s;tra|cy that will be &s;atisfy'd with a le&s;s exorbitant Power.

When that is done, we will acknowledg that what&s;oever we have is deriv'd from the favor of our Ma&s;ter. But no &s;uch thing yet appearing among&s;t us, we may be pardon'd if we think we are Free-men govern'd by our own Laws, and that no man has a Power over us, which is not given and re|gulated by them; nor that any thing but a new Law made by our &s;elves, can exempt our Kings from the obligation of performing their Oaths taken, to govern according to the old, in the true &s;en&s;e of the words, as they are under&s;tood in our Language by tho&s;e who give them, and conducing to the ends for which they are given, which can be no other than to defend us from all manner of arbitrary Power, and to fix a rule to which we are to conform our Actions, and from which, according to our de&s;erts, we may expect reward or puni&s;hment. And tho&s;e who by prevarications, cavils or equivocations, endeavour to di&s;&s;olve the&s;e Obligations, do either maliciou&s;ly betray the cau&s;e of Kings, by repre&s;enting them to the world as men who prefer the &s;atisfaction of their irregular Appetites before the performance of their duty, and trample under foot the mo&s;t &s;acred bonds of human Society; or from the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ignorance do not &s;ee, that by teaching Nations how little they can rely upon the Oaths of their Princes, they in&s;truct them as little to ob&s;erve their own; and that not only becau&s;e men are generally inclin'd to follow the examples of tho&s;e in power, but from a mo&s;t certain conclu&s;ion, that he who breaks his part of a Contract cannot without the utmo&s;t impu|dence and folly expect the performance of the other; nothing being more known among&s;t men, than that all Contracts are of &s;uch mutual obligation, that he who fails of his part di&s;charges the other. If this be &s;o between man and man, it mu&s;t needs be &s;o between one and many millions of men: If he were free, becau&s;e he &s;ays he is, every man mu&s;t be free al&s;o when he plea&s;es; if a private man who receives no benefit, or perhaps prejudice from a Contract, be oblig'd to perform the conditions, much more are Kings who receive the greate&s;t advantages the world can give. As they are not by them&s;elves nor for them&s;elves, &s;o they are not different <HI>in &s;pecie</HI> from other men: they are born, live and die as we all do. The &s;ame Law of Truth and Ju&s;tice is given to all by God and Na|ture; and perhaps I may &s;ay the performance of it is mo&s;t rigorou&s;ly exacted from the greate&s;t of men. The liberty of Perjury cannot be a privilege annex'd to Crowns; and 'tis ab&s;urd to think that the mo&s;t vene|rable Authority that can be confer'd upon a man, is increas'd by a liberty to commit, or impunity in committing &s;uch crimes as are the greate&s;t aggravations of infamy to the ba&s;e&s;t villains in the world.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XVIII.   The next in blood to deceas'd Kings cannot generally be &s;aid to be Kings till they are crown'd.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS hereupon u&s;ually objected, that Kings do not come in by Con|tract nor by Oath, but are Kings by, or according to proximity of Blood, before they are crown'd. Tho this be a bold Propo&s;ition, I will not &s;ay 'tis univer&s;ally fal&s;e. 'Tis po&s;&s;ible that in &s;ome places the rule of Succe&s;&s;ion may be &s;et down &s;o preci&s;ely, that in &s;ome ca&s;es every man may be able to &s;ee and know the &s;en&s;e, as well as the Per&s;on de&s;ign'd to be the Succe&s;&s;or: but before I acknowledg it to be univer&s;ally true, I mu&s;t de&s;ire to know what this rule of Succe&s;&s;ion is, and from whence it draws its original.</P>
<P>I think I may be excus'd if I make the&s;e &s;cruples, becau&s;e I find the thing in di&s;pute to be variou&s;ly adjudg'd in &s;everal places, and have ob|&s;erv'd five different manners of di&s;po&s;ing Crowns e&s;teem'd Hereditary, be&s;ides an infinite number of collateral Controver&s;ys ari&s;ing from them, of which we have divers examples; and if there be one univer&s;al rule ap|pointed, one of the&s;e only can be right, and all the others mu&s;t be vicious. The fir&s;t gives the inheritance to the elde&s;t Male of the elde&s;t legitimate Line, as in <HI>France,</HI> according to that which they call the <HI>Salique Law.</HI> The &s;econd, to the elde&s;t legitimate Male of the reigning Family, as an|tiently in <HI>Spain,</HI> according to which the Brother of the deceas'd King has bin often, if not always prefer'd before the Son, if he were elder, as may appear by the di&s;pute between <HI>Corbis</HI> and <HI>Or&s;ua,</HI> cited before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rom <HI>Titus Livius;</HI> and in the &s;ame Country during the reign of the <HI>Goths,</HI> the elde&s;t Male &s;ucceeded, whether Legitimate or Illegitimate. The fourth receives Females or their De&s;cendents, without any other condition di&s;tin|gui&s;hing them from Males, except that the younger Brother is prefer'd before the elder Si&s;ter, but the daughter of the elder Brother is prefer'd before the Son of the younger. The fifth gives the Inheritance to Females under a condition, as in <HI>Sweden,</HI> where they inherit, unle&s;s they marry out of the Country without the con&s;ent of the E&s;tates; according to which rule <HI>Charles Gu&s;tavus</HI> was cho&s;en, as any Stranger might have bin, tho Son to a Si&s;ter of <HI>Gu&s;tavus Adolphus,</HI> who by marrying a <HI>German</HI> Prince had forfeited her right. And by the &s;ame act of E&s;tates, by which her el|de&s;t Son was cho&s;en, and the Crown entail'd upon the Heirs of his Body, her &s;econd Son the Prince <HI>Adolphus</HI> was wholly excluded.</P>
<P>Till the&s;e que&s;tions are decided by a Judg of &s;uch undoubted Authority, that all men may &s;afely &s;ubmit, 'tis hard for any man who really &s;eeks the &s;atisfaction of his Con&s;cience, to know whether the Law of God and Nature (tho he &s;hould believe there is one general Law) do ju&s;tify the Cu&s;toms of the antient <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LG>

  as unfit to reign over men, and utterly unable to perform the duty of a &s;upreme Magi&s;trate, as we &s;ee they are every where excluded from the exerci&s;e of all other Offices in the Commonwealth. If it be &s;aid that we ought to follow the Cu&s;toms of our own Country, I an&s;wer, that tho&s;e of our own Country de&s;erve to be ob&s;erv'd, becau&s;e they are of our own Country: But they are no more to be call'd the Laws of God and Nature than tho&s;e of <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Germany;</HI> and tho I do not be|lieve that any general Law is appointed, I wi&s;h I were &s;ure that our Cu&s;toms in this point were not more repugnant to the light of Nature, and prejudicial to our &s;elves, than tho&s;e of &s;ome other Nations. But if I &s;hould be &s;o much an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-man, to think the will of God to have bin more particularly reveal'd to our Ance&s;tors, than to any other Nation, and that all of them ought to learn from us; yet it would be difficult to de|cide many que&s;tions that may ari&s;e. For tho the Parliament in the 36<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, made an Act in favour of <HI>Richard</HI> Duke of <HI>York,</HI> de&s;cended from a Daughter of <HI>Mortimer,</HI> who marry'd the Daughter of the Duke of <HI>Clarence,</HI> elder Brother to <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Gaunt,</HI> they rather a&s;|&s;erted their own power of giving the Crown to whom they pleas'd, than determin'd the que&s;tion. For if they had believ'd that the Crown had belong'd to him by a general and eternal Law, they mu&s;t immediately have rejected <HI>Henry</HI> as a U&s;urper, and put <HI>Richard</HI> into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Right, which they did not. And tho they did &s;omething like to this in the ca&s;es of <HI>Maud</HI> the Empre&s;s in relation to King <HI>Stephen,</HI> and her Son <HI>Henry</HI> the 2<HI>d;</HI> and of <HI>Henry</HI> the 7<HI>th</HI> in relation to the hou&s;e of <HI>York,</HI> both before he had marry'd a Daughter of it, and after her death; they did the contrary in the ca&s;es of <HI>William</HI> the fir&s;t and &s;econd, <HI>Henry</HI> the 1<HI>&s;t, Stephen, John, Richard</HI> the 3<HI>d, Henry</HI> the 7<HI>th, Mary, Elizabeth,</HI> and others. So that, for any thing I can yet find, 'tis equally difficult to di&s;cover the true &s;en&s;e of the Law of Nature that &s;hould be a guide to my Con&s;cience, whether I &s;o far &s;ubmit to the Laws of my Country, to think that <HI>England</HI> alone has produc'd men that rightly under&s;tand it, or examin the Laws and Practices of other Nations.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t this remains undecided, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for me to know to whom I owe the obedience that is exacted from me. If I were a <HI>French</HI>-man, I could not tell whether I ow'd allegiance to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> Duke of <HI>Lor|rain,</HI> Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> or many others de&s;cended from Daughters of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Valois,</HI> one of whom ought to inherit, if the Inheritance belongs to Fe|males; or to the hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> who&s;e only title is founded upon the ex|clu&s;ion of them. The like Controver&s;ys will be in all places; and he that would put Mankind upon &s;uch inquirys, goes about to &s;ubvert all the Go|vernments of the World, and arms every man to the de&s;truction of his neighbor.</P>
<P>We ought to be inform'd when this right began: If we had the Ge|nealogy of every man from <HI>Noah,</HI> and the Crowns of every Nation had &s;ince his time continu'd in one Line, we were only to inquire into how many Kingdoms he appointed the World to be divided, and how well the divi&s;ion we &s;ee at this day agrees with the allotment made by him. But Mankind having for many ages lain under &s;uch a va&s;t confu&s;ion, that no man pretends to know his own original, except &s;ome <HI>Jews,</HI> and the Princes of the hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> we cannot &s;o ea&s;ily arrive at the end of our work; and the Scriptures making no other mention of this part of the world, than what may induce us to think it was given to the Sons of <HI>Japhet,</HI> we have nothing that can lead us to gue&s;s how it was to be &s;ubdi|vided,
<PB N="303" REF="311">
nor to whom the &s;everal parcels were given: So that the difficultys   are ab&s;olutely inextricable; and tho it were true, that &s;ome one man had a right to every parcel that is known to us, it could be of no u&s;e; for that Right mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily peri&s;h which no man can prove, nor indeed claim. But as all natural Rights by Inheritance mu&s;t be by De&s;cent, this De&s;cent not being prov'd, there can be no natural Right; and all Rights being either natural, created or acquir'd, this Right to Crowns not being natural, mu&s;t be created or acquir'd, or none at all.</P>
<P>There being no general Law common to all Nations, creating a Right to Crowns (as has bin prov'd by the &s;everal methods us'd by &s;everal Nations in the di&s;po&s;al of them, according to which all tho&s;e that we know are enjoy'd) we mu&s;t &s;eek the Right concerning which we di&s;pute, from the particular Con&s;titutions of every Nation, or we &s;hall be able to find none.</P>
<P>Acquir'd Rights are obtain'd, as men &s;ay, either by fair means or by foul, that is, by force or by con&s;ent: &s;uch as are gain'd by force, may be recover'd by force; and the extent of tho&s;e that are enjoy'd by con&s;ent, can only be known by the rea&s;ons for which, or the conditions upon which that con&s;ent was obtain'd, that is to &s;ay, by the Laws of every People. According to the&s;e Laws it cannot be &s;aid that there is a King in every Nation before he is crown'd. <HI>John Sobietski</HI> now reigning in <HI>Poland,</HI> had no relation in blood to the former Kings, nor any title till he was cho&s;en. The la&s;t King of <HI>Sweden</HI> acknowledg'd he had none, but was freely elected; and the Crown being confer'd upon him and the Heirs of his Body, if the pre&s;ent King dies without I&s;&s;ue, the right of electing a Succe&s;&s;or returns undoubtedly to the E&s;tates of the Country. The Crown of <HI>Denmark</HI> was Elective till it was made Hereditary by an Act of the General Diet held at <HI>Copenhagen</HI> in the year 1660; and 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible that a Right &s;hould otherwi&s;e accrue to a younger Brother of the hou&s;e of <HI>Hol&s;tein,</HI> which is deriv'd from a younger Brother of the Counts of <HI>Oldenburgh.</HI> The <HI>Roman</HI> Empire having pa&s;s'd thro the hands of ma|ny Per&s;ons of different Nations, no way relating to each other in blood, was by <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> transfer'd to <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> and after many Revolu|tions coming to <HI>Theodo&s;ius,</HI> by birth a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> was divided between his two Sons <HI>Arcadius</HI> and <HI>Honorius.</HI> From thence pa&s;&s;ing to &s;uch as could gain mo&s;t credit with the Soldiers, the We&s;tern Empire being brought almo&s;t to nothing, was re&s;tor'd by <HI>Charles</HI> the Great of <HI>France;</HI> and con|tinuing for &s;ome time in his de&s;cendents, came to the <HI>Germans;</HI> who having created &s;everal Emperors of the Hou&s;es of <HI>Suevia, Saxony, Ba|varia</HI> and others, as they pleas'd, about three hundred years pa&s;t cho&s;e <HI>Rodolphus</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria:</HI> and tho &s;ince that time they have not had any Em|peror who was not of that Family; yet &s;uch as were cho&s;en had no|thing to recommend them, but the merits of their Ance&s;tors, their own per&s;onal Vertues, or &s;uch political con&s;iderations as might ari&s;e from the power of their hereditary Countrys, which being join'd with tho&s;e of the Empire, might enable 'em to make the better defence again&s;t the <HI>Turks.</HI> But in this Line al&s;o they have had little regard to inheritance according to blood; for the elder branch of the Family is that which reigns in <HI>Spain;</HI> and the Empire continues in the de&s;cendents of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> younger Bro|ther to <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, tho &s;o unfix'd even to this time, that the pre&s;ent Emperor <HI>Leopold</HI> was in great danger of being rejected.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid that the&s;e are elective Kingdoms, and our Author &s;peaks of &s;uch as are hereditary; I an&s;wer, that if what he &s;ays be true, there
<PB N="304" REF="312">
  can be no Elective Kingdom, and every Nation has a natural Lord to whom obedience is due. But if &s;ome are Elective, all might have bin &s;o if they had pleas'd, unle&s;s it can be prov'd, that God created &s;ome un|der a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubjection, and left to others the enjoyment of their li|berty. If this be &s;o, the Nations born under that nece&s;&s;ity may be &s;aid to have a natural Lord, who has all the power in him&s;elf, before he is crown'd, or any part confer'd on him by the con&s;ent of the people; but it cannot extend to others. And he who pretends a right over any Na|tion upon that account, &s;tands oblig'd to &s;hew when and how that Na|tion came to be di&s;criminated by God from others, and depriv'd of that liberty which he in goodne&s;s had granted to the re&s;t of mankind. I con|fe&s;s I think there is no &s;uch Right, and need no better proof than the va|rious ways of di&s;po&s;ing Inheritances in &s;everal Countrys, which not be|ing naturally or univer&s;ally better or wor&s;e one than another, cannot &s;pring from any other root, than the con&s;ent of the &s;everal Nations where they are in force, and their opinions that &s;uch methods were be&s;t for them. But if God has made a di&s;crimination of people, he that would there|upon ground a Title to the dominion of any one, mu&s;t prove that Nation to be under the cur&s;e of Slavery, which for any thing I know, was only denounc'd again&s;t <HI>Cham:</HI> and 'tis as hard to determin whether the &s;en&s;e of it be temporal, &s;piritual, or both, as to tell preci&s;ely what Nations by being de&s;cended from him, fall under the Penaltys threaten'd.</P>
<P>If the&s;e therefore be either intirely fal&s;e, or impo&s;&s;ible to be prov'd true, there is no di&s;crimination, or not known to us; and every People has a right of di&s;po&s;ing of their Government, as well as the <HI>Polanders, Danes, Swedes, Germans,</HI> and &s;uch as are or were under the <HI>Roman</HI> Em|pire. And if any Nation has a natural Lord before he be admitted by their con&s;ent, it mu&s;t be by a peculiar act of their own; as the Crown of <HI>France</HI> by an act of that Nation, which they call the Salique Law, is made hereditary to Males in a direct Line, or the neare&s;t to the direct; and others in other places are otherwi&s;e di&s;pos'd.</P>
<P>I might re&s;t here with full a&s;&s;urance that no Di&s;ciple of <HI>Filmer</HI> can prove this of any people in the world, nor give &s;o much as the &s;hadow of a rea&s;on to per&s;uade us there is any &s;uch thing in any Nation, or at lea&s;t in tho&s;e where we are concern'd; and pre&s;ume little regard will be had to what he has &s;aid, &s;ince he cannot prove of any that which he &s;o boldly affirms of all. But becau&s;e good men ought to have no other ob|ject than Truth, which in matters of this importance can never be made too evident, I will venture to go farther, and a&s;&s;ert, That as the various ways by which &s;everal Nations di&s;po&s;e of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to their re&s;pective Crowns, &s;hew they were &s;ubject to no other Law than their own, which they might have made different, by the &s;ame right they made it to be what it is, even tho&s;e who have the greate&s;t veneration for the reigning Familys, and the highe&s;t regard for proximity of blood, have always prefer'd the &s;afety of the Commonwealth before the concernments of any Per&s;on or Family, and have laid a&s;ide the neare&s;t in blood, not only when they were found to be notoriou&s;ly vicious and wicked, but when they have thought it more convenient to take others: And to prove this I intend to make u&s;e of no other Examples than tho&s;e I find in the Hi&s;torys of <HI>Spain, France</HI> and <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Whil&s;t the <HI>Goths</HI> govern'd <HI>Spain,</HI> not above four per&s;ons in the &s;pace of three hundred years were the immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of their Fathers, but the Brother, Cou&s;in German, or &s;ome other man of the Familys of the

<HI>Balthei</HI> or <HI>Amalthei</HI> was prefer'd before the Children of the deceas'd King:   and if it be &s;aid, this was according to the Law of that Kingdom, I an|&s;wer, that it was therefore in the power of that Nation to make Laws for them&s;elves, and con&s;equently others have the &s;ame right.

<P>This Kingdom being not long after overthrown by the <HI>Moors,</HI> a new one aro&s;e from its a&s;hes in the per&s;on of <HI>Don Pelayo</HI> fir&s;t King of the <HI>A&s;tu|ria</HI>'s, which increa&s;ing by degrees at la&s;t came to comprehend all <HI>Spain,</HI> and &s;o continues to this day: But not troubling my &s;elf with all the de|viations from the common rule in the collateral Lines of <HI>Navarr, Arragon</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> I find that by fifteen &s;everal In&s;tances in that one &s;eries of Kings in the <HI>A&s;turia</HI>'s and <HI>Leon</HI> (who afterwards came to be Kings of <HI>Ca&s;tille)</HI> it is fully prov'd, that what re&s;pect &s;oever they &s;hew'd to the next in blood, who by the Law were to &s;ucceed, they prefer'd &s;ome other per|&s;on, as often as the &s;upreme Law of <HI>taking care that the Nation might re|ceive no detriment,</HI> per&s;uaded them to it.</P>

<P>1. When a King of <HI>Pharamond</HI>'s Race dy'd, the Kingdom was divid|ed into as many parcels as he had Sons; which could not have bin, if one certain Heir had bin a&s;&s;ign'd by nature, for he ought to have had the whole: and if the Kingdom might be divided, they who inhabited the &s;everal parcels, could not know to whom they ow'd obedience, till the divi&s;ion was made, unle&s;s he who was to be King of <HI>Paris, Metz, Soi&s;|&s;ons</HI> or <HI>Orleans,</HI> had worn the Name of his Kingdom upon his forehead. But in truth, if there might be a divi&s;ion, the Doctrin is fal&s;e, and there was no Lord of the whole. This wound will not be heal'd, by &s;aying, The Father appointed the divi&s;ion, and that by the Law of nature every man may di&s;po&s;e of his own as he thinks fit; for we &s;hall &s;oon prove that the Kingdom of <HI>France</HI> neither was, nor is di&s;po&s;able as a Patrimo|ny or Chattel. Be&s;ides, if that Act of Kings had bin then grounded upon the Law of nature, they might do the like at this day. But the Law, by which &s;uch Divi&s;ions were made, having bin abrogated by the A&s;&s;em|bly <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;t. de Fr. en la Vie de Hu|gues Capet.</NOTE>of E&s;tates in the time of <HI>Hugh Capet,</HI> and never practis'd &s;ince, it follows that they were grounded upon a temporary Law, and not upon the Law of Nature which is eternal. If this were not &s;o, the pretended certainty could not be; for no man could know to whom the la&s;t King had bequeath'd the whole Kingdom, or parcels of it, till the Will were open'd; and that mu&s;t be done before &s;uch Witne&s;&s;es as may de&s;erve cre|dit in a matter of this importance, and are able to judg whether the Be|que&s;t be rightly made; for otherwi&s;e no man could know, whether the Kingdom was to have one Lord or many, nor who he or they were to be; which intermi&s;&s;ion mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;ubvert their Polity, and this Doctrin.

<P>2. This matter was made more clear under the &s;econd race. If a Lord had bin a&s;&s;ign'd to them by nature, he mu&s;t have bin of the Royal Family: But <HI>Pepin</HI> had no other Title to the Crown, except the merits of his Father, and his own, approv'd by the Nobility and People who made him King. He had three &s;ons, the elde&s;t was made King of <HI>Italy,</HI> and dying before him left a Son call'd <HI>Bernard</HI> Heir of that Kingdom. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Paul. Aemil. Hi&s;t. Franc&punc;</NOTE>The E&s;tates of <HI>France</HI> divided what remain'd between <HI>Charles</HI> the Great and <HI>Carloman,</HI> The la&s;t of the&s;e dying in a few years, left many Sons, but the Nobility made <HI>Charles</HI> King of all <HI>France,</HI> and he di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;t <HI>Ber|nard</HI> of the Kingdom of <HI>Italy</HI> inherited from his Father: &s;o that he al&s;o was not King of the whole, before the expul&s;ion of <HI>Bernard</HI> the Son of his elder Brother; nor of <HI>Aquitain,</HI> which by inheritance &s;hould have belong'd to the Children of his younger Brother, any otherwi&s;e than by the will of the E&s;tates. <HI>Lewis</HI> the <HI>Debonair</HI> &s;ucceeded upon the &s;ame title, was depos'd and put into a Mona&s;tery by his three Sons <HI>Lothair, Pepin</HI> and <HI>Lewis,</HI> whom he had by his fir&s;t Wife. But tho the&s;e left many Sons, the Kingdom came to <HI>Charles</HI> the Bald. The Nobility and People di&s;liking the elde&s;t Son of <HI>Charles,</HI> gave the Kingdom to <HI>Lewis le Begue,</HI> who had a legitimate Son called <HI>Charles le Simple;</HI> but his two Ba&s;tards, <HI>Lewis</HI> and <HI>Carloman,</HI> were made Kings. <HI>Carloman</HI> had a Son call'd <HI>Lewis le faineant;</HI> he was made King, but afterwards depos'd for his vi|cious Life. <HI>Charles le Gro&s;s</HI> &s;ucceeded him, but for his ill Govern|ment was al&s;o depos'd; and <HI>Odo,</HI> who was a &s;tranger to the Royal Blood, was made King. The &s;ame Nobility that had made five Kings &s;ince <HI>Lewis le Begue,</HI> now made <HI>Charles le Simple</HI> King, who according to his name was entrap'd at <HI>Peronne</HI> by <HI>Ralph</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and forc'd to re&s;ign his Crown, leaving only a Son call'd <HI>Lewis,</HI> who fled into <HI>England. Ralph</HI> being dead, they took <HI>Lewis</HI> &s;irnam'd <HI>Outremer,</HI> and plac'd him in the Throne: he had two Sons, <HI>Lothair</HI> and <HI>Charles. Lothair</HI> &s;ucceeded him, and dy'd without I&s;&s;ue. <HI>Charles</HI> had as fair a title as could be by Birth, and the E&s;tates confe&s;t it; but their Emba&s;&s;adors told him, that he having by an unworthy Life render'd him&s;elf unworthy of the Crown, they, who&s;e principal care was to have a good Prince at the head of them, had cho&s;en <HI>Hugh Capet;</HI> and the Crown continues in his race to this day, tho not altogether without interruption. <HI>Robert</HI> Son to <HI>Hugh Capet</HI> &s;ucceeded him. He left two Sons <HI>Robert</HI> and <HI>Henry;</HI> but <HI>Henry</HI> the younger Son appearing to the E&s;tates of the Kingdom to be more fit to reign than his elder Brother, they made him King, <HI>Robert</HI> and his de&s;cen|dents continuing Dukes of <HI>Burgundy</HI> only for about ten Generations; at which time his I&s;&s;ue Male failing, that Dutchy return'd to the Crown during the Life of King <HI>John,</HI> who gave it to his &s;econd Son <HI>Philip</HI> for an <HI>Apannage</HI> &s;till depending upon the Crown. The &s;ame Province of <HI>Burgundy</HI> was by the Treaty of <HI>Madrid</HI> granted to the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;i&s;th by <HI>Francis</HI> the fir&s;t: but the People refus'd to be alienated, and the E&s;tates of the Kingdom approv'd their refu&s;al. By the &s;ame Authority <HI>Charles</HI> the 6<HI>th</HI> was remov'd from the Government, when he appear'd to be mad; and other examples of a like nature may be alledg'd. From which we may &s;afely conclude, that if the death of one King dos really inve&s;t the next Heir with the Right and Power, or that he who is &s;o inve&s;ted, be &s;ubject to no Law but his own Will, all matters relating
<PB N="308" REF="316">

<P>3. If the next Heir be actually King, &s;eiz'd of the power by the death of his Predece&s;&s;or, &s;o that there is no intermi&s;&s;ion; then all the Solem|nitys and religious Ceremonys us'd at the Coronations of their Kings, with the Oaths given and taken, are the mo&s;t profane abu&s;es of &s;acred things in contempt of God and Man that can be imagin'd, mo&s;t e&s;pecially if the Act be (as our Author calls it) voluntary, and the King receiving nothing by it, be bound to keep it no longer than he plea&s;es. The Prince who is to be &s;worn, might &s;pare the pains of watching all night in the Church, fa&s;ting, praying, confe&s;&s;ing, communicating, and &s;wearing, <HI>that he will to the utmo&s;t of his power defend the Clergy, maintain the union of the Church, obviate all exce&s;s, rapine, extortion and iniquity; take care that in all judgments Ju&s;tice may be ob&s;erv'd, with Equity and Mercy, &amp;c. or of invoking the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Holy Gho&s;t for the better performance of his Oath;</HI> and without ceremony tell the Nobility and People, that he would do what he thought fit. 'Twere to as little purpo&s;e for the Arch|bi&s;hop of <HI>Rheims</HI> to take the trouble of &s;aying Ma&s;s, delivering to him the Crown, Scepter, and other en&s;igns of Royalty, explaining what is &s;ignify'd by them, anointing him with the Oil which they &s;ay was de|liver'd by an Angel to St. <HI>Remigius,</HI> ble&s;&s;ing him, and praying to God to ble&s;s him if he rightly perform'd his Oath to God and the People, and de|nouncing the contrary in ca&s;e of failure on his part, if the&s;e things con|fer'd nothing upon him but what he had before, and were of no obliga|tion to him. Such ludifications of the mo&s;t &s;acred things are too odious and impious to be imputed to Nations that have any vertue, or profe&s;s Chri&s;tianity. This cannot fall upon the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who had certainly a great zeal to Religion, whatever it was; and were &s;o eminent &s;or moral Vertues as to be a reproach to us, who live in an Age of more Knowledg.

of his Reputation, Valor, Victorys, and Affability, could never be admit|ted,   till he had made him&s;elf capable of the ceremonys of his Coronation, by conforming to the Religion which by the Oath he was to defend. Nay this pre&s;ent King, tho haughty enough by nature, and elevated by many &s;ucce&s;&s;es, has acknowledg'd, as he &s;ays, with joy, that he can do nothing contrary to Law, and calls it a happy impotence; in pur&s;uance of which he has annul'd many Acts of his Father and Grandfather, alie|nating the demea&s;nes of the Crown, as things contrary to Law, and not within their power.</P>
<P>The&s;e things being confirm'd by all the good Authors of that Nation, <HI>Filmer</HI> finds only the wor&s;t to be fit for his turn; and neither minding Law nor Hi&s;tory, takes his Maxims from a vile flattering di&s;cour&s;e of <HI>Bellay,</HI> calculated for the per&s;onal Intere&s;t of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth then King of <HI>Navarr,</HI> in which he &s;ays, <HI>That the Heir apparent, tho furious, mad,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Apol. Cathol.</NOTE><HI>a fool, vicious, and in all re&s;pects abominably wicked, mu&s;t be admitted to the Crown.</HI> But <HI>Bellay</HI> was &s;o far from attaining the ends de&s;ign'd by his Book, that by &s;uch Doctrins, which fill'd all men with horror, he brought great prejudice to his Ma&s;ter, and procur'd little favor from <HI>Henry,</HI> who de&s;ir'd rather to recommend him&s;elf to his People as the be&s;t man they could &s;et up, than to impo&s;e a nece&s;&s;ity upon 'em of taking him if he had bin the wor&s;t. But our Author, not contented with what this Sycophant &s;ays, in relation to &s;uch Princes as are plac'd in the Govern|ment by a Law e&s;tabli&s;hing the Succe&s;&s;ion by inheritance, with an impu|dence peculiar to him&s;elf, a&s;&s;erts the &s;ame right to be in any man, who by any means gets into Power; and impo&s;es the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity of obedi|ence upon the Subject where there is no Law, as <HI>Bellay</HI> dos by virtue of one that is e&s;tabli&s;h'd.</P>
<P>4. In the la&s;t place: As <HI>Bellay</HI> acknowledges that the right belongs to Princes only where 'tis e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Law, I deny that there is, was, or ever can be any &s;uch. No People is known to have bin &s;o mad or wicked, as by their own con&s;ent, for their own good, and for the obtaining of Ju&s;|tice, to give the power to Bea&s;ts, under whom it could never be ob|tain'd: or if we could believe that any had bin guilty of an act &s;o full of folly, turpitude and wickedne&s;s, it could not have the force of a Law, and could never be put in execution; for tho the rules, by which the proximity &s;hould be judg'd, be never &s;o preci&s;e, it will &s;till be doubted who&s;e ca&s;e &s;utes be&s;t with them. Tho the Law in &s;ome places gives pri|vate Inheritances to the next Heir, and in others makes allotments accord|ing to &s;everal proportions, no one knows to whom, or how far the benefit &s;hall accrue to any man, till it be adjudg'd by a Power to which the par|tys mu&s;t &s;ubmit. Conte&s;ts will in the like manner ari&s;e concerning &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ions to Crowns, how exactly &s;oever they be di&s;pos'd by Law: For tho every one will &s;ay that the next ought to &s;ucceed, yet no man knows who is the next; which is too much verify'd by the bloody deci&s;ions of &s;uch di&s;putes in many parts of the world: and he that &s;ays the next in blood is actually King, makes all que&s;tions thereupon ari&s;ing impo&s;&s;ible to be otherwi&s;e determin'd than by the Sword; the pretender to the right being plac'd above the judgment of man, and the Subjects (for any thing I know) oblig'd to believe, &s;erve and obey him, if he &s;ays he has it. For otherwi&s;e, if either every man in particular, or all together have a right of judging his title, it can be of no value till it be adjudg'd.</P>

  I confe&s;s that the Law of <HI>France,</HI> by the utter exclu&s;ion of Females and their de&s;cendents, dos obviate many dangerous and inextricable difficul|tys; but others remain which are &s;ufficient to &s;ubvert all the Polity of that Kingdom, if there be not a power of judging them; and there can be none if it be true that <HI>Le mort &s;ai&s;it le vif.</HI> Not to trouble my &s;elf with feign'd ca&s;es, that of Legitimation alone will &s;uffice. 'Tis not e|nough to &s;ay that the Children born under marriage are to be reputed le|gitimate; for not only &s;everal Children born of <HI>Joan</HI> Daughter to the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> Wife to <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth of <HI>Ca&s;tille,</HI> during the time of their Marriage, were utterly rejected as begotten in Adultery, but al&s;o her Daughter <HI>Joan,</HI> whom the King during his life, and at the hour of his death acknowledg'd to have bin begotten by him; and the only Title that <HI>I&s;abel,</HI> who was marry'd to <HI>Ferdinand</HI> of <HI>Arragon,</HI> had to the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> was deriv'd from their rejection. It would be tedious, and might give offence to many great Per&s;ons, if I &s;hould relate all the dubious ca&s;es, that have bin, or &s;till remain in the World, touching mat|ters of this nature: but the Lawyers of all Nations will te&s;tify, that hardly any one point comes before them, which affords a greater number of difficult Ca&s;es, than that of Marriages, and the Legitimation of Chil|dren upon them; and Nations mu&s;t be involv'd in the mo&s;t inextricable difficultys, if there be not a power &s;omewhere to decide them; which cannot be, if there be no intermi&s;&s;ion, and that the next in blood (that is, he who &s;ays he is the next) be immediately inve&s;ted with the right and power. But &s;urely no people has bin &s;o carele&s;s of their mo&s;t important Concernments, to leave them in &s;uch uncertainty, and &s;imply to depend upon the humor of a man, or the faith of women, who be&s;ides their other Frailtys, have bin often accus'd of &s;uppo&s;ititious Births: and mens pa&s;&s;ions are known to be &s;o violent in relation to Women they love or hate, that none can &s;afely be tru&s;ted with tho&s;e Judgments. The vertue of the be&s;t would be expos'd to a temptation, that fle&s;h and blood can hardly re&s;i&s;t; and &s;uch as are le&s;s perfect would follow no other rule than the blind impul&s;e of the pa&s;&s;ion that for the pre&s;ent reigns in them. There mu&s;t therefore be a judg of &s;uch di&s;putes as may in the&s;e ca&s;es ari&s;e in every Kingdom; and tho 'tis not my bu&s;ine&s;s to determin who is that judg in all places, yet I may ju&s;tly &s;ay, that in <HI>England</HI> it is the Parlia|ment. If no inferior Authority could debar <HI>Ignotus</HI> Son to the Lady <HI>Ro&s;&s;e,</HI> born under the Protection, from the inheritance of a private Fami|ly, none can certainly a&s;&s;ume a power of di&s;po&s;ing of the Crown upon any occa&s;ion. No Authority but that of the Parliament could legitimate the Children of <HI>Catherine Swinford,</HI> with a provi&s;o, not to extend to the inheritance of the Crown. Others might &s;ay, if they were lawfully begotten, they ought to inherit every thing, and nothing if they were not: But the Parliament knew how to limit a particular favor, and pre|vent it from extending to a publick mi&s;chief. <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth took an expeditious way of obviating part of the Controver&s;ys that might ari&s;e from the multitude of his Wives, by cutting off the heads of &s;ome, as &s;oon as he was weary of them, or had a mind to take another; but hav|ing bin hinder'd from dealing in the &s;ame manner with <HI>Catherine</HI> by the greatne&s;s of her birth and kindred, he left &s;uch as the Parliament only could re&s;olve. And no le&s;s power would ever have thought of making <HI>Mary</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth</HI> capable of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, when, according to ordi|nary rules, one of 'em mu&s;t have bin a Ba&s;tard; and it had bin ab&s;urd to &s;ay, that both of 'em were immediately upon the death of their Prede|ce&s;&s;ors

  him&s;elf any other Wi&s;e, Children or Goods, than he can procure by his own Sword.</P>
<P>Some may perhaps think that the endeavours of our Author to intro|duce &s;uch accur&s;ed Principles as tend to the ruin of Mankind, proceed from his ignorance. But tho he appears to have had a great mea&s;ure of that quality, I fear the evil proceeds from a deeper root; and that he at|tempts to promote the intere&s;ts of ill Magi&s;trats, who make it their bu&s;i|ne&s;s to de&s;troy all good principles in the People, with as much indu&s;try as the good endeavour to pre&s;erve them where they are, and teach them where they are wanting. Rea&s;on and Experience in&s;truct us, that every man acts according to the end he propo&s;es to him&s;elf. The good Magi|&s;trate &s;eeks the good of the People committed to his care, that he may perform the end of his In&s;titution: and knowing that chiefly to con&s;i&s;t in Ju&s;tice and Vertue, he endeavours to plant and propagate them; and by doing this he procures his own good, as well as that of the Publick. He knows there is no Safety where there is no Strength, no Strength without Union, no Union without Ju&s;tice; no Ju&s;tice where Faith and Truth, in accompli&s;hing publick and private Contracts, is wanting. This he perpetually inculcates, and thinks it a great part of his duty, by precept and example, to educate the Youth in a love of Vertue and Truth, that they may be &s;ea&s;on'd with them, and fill'd with an abhor|rence of Vice and Fal&s;hood, before they attain that Age which is expos'd to the mo&s;t violent temptations, and in which they may by their crimes bring the greate&s;t mi&s;chiefs upon the publick. He would do all this, tho it were to his own prejudice. But as good Actions always carry a re|ward with them, the&s;e contribute in a high mea&s;ure to his advantage. By preferring the intere&s;t of the People before his own, he gains their affection, and all that is in their power comes with it; whil&s;t he unites them to one another, he unites all to him&s;elf: In leading them to vertue, he increa&s;es their &s;trength, and by that means provides for his own &s;afety, glory and power.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide, &s;uch as &s;eek different ends mu&s;t take different ways. When a Magi&s;trate fancys he is not made for the People, but the Peo|ple for him; that he dos not govern for them, but for him&s;elf; and that the People live only to increa&s;e his glory, or to furni&s;h matter for his plea&s;ures, he dos not inquire what he may do for them, but what he may draw from them. By this means he &s;ets up an intere&s;t of profit, plea&s;ure or pomp in him&s;elf, repugnant to the good of the publick for which he is made to be what he is. The&s;e contrary ends certainly divide the Nation into partys; and whil&s;t every one endeavours to advance that to which he is addicted, occa&s;ions of hatred for injurys every day done, or thought to be done and receiv'd, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e. This creates a mo&s;t fierce and irreconcilable enmity, becau&s;e the occa&s;ions are frequent, important and univer&s;al, and the cau&s;es thought to be mo&s;t ju&s;t. The People think it the greate&s;t of all crimes, to convert that power to their hurt, which was in&s;tituted for their good; and that the inju&s;tice is ag|gravated by perjury and ingratitude, which comprehend all manner of ill; and the Magi&s;trate gives the name of Sedition or Rebellion to what|&s;oever they do for the pre&s;ervation of them&s;elves and their own Rights. When mens Spirits are thus prepar'd, a &s;mall matter &s;ets them on fire; but if no accident happen to blow them into a flame, the cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice is certainly interrupted, the publick affairs are neglected; and when any occa&s;ion whether foreign or dome&s;tick ari&s;es, in which the Magi&s;trate
<PB N="313" REF="321">
&s;tands in need of the Peoples a&s;&s;i&s;tance, they, who&s;e affections are alie|nated,   not only &s;hew an unwillingne&s;s to &s;erve him with their Per&s;ons and E&s;tates, but fear that by delivering him from his di&s;tre&s;s they &s;treng|then their enemy, and enable him to oppre&s;s them: and he fancying his will to be unju&s;tly oppos'd, or his due more unju&s;tly deny'd, is fill'd with a di&s;like of what he &s;ees, and a fear of wor&s;e for the future. Whil&s;t he endeavours to ea&s;e him&s;elf of the one, and to provide again&s;t the other, he u&s;ually increa&s;es the evils of both, and jealou&s;ys are on both &s;ides mul|tiply'd. Every man knows that the Governed are in a great mea&s;ure un|der the power of the Governor; but as no man, or number of men, is willingly &s;ubject to tho&s;e who &s;eek their ruin, &s;uch as fall into &s;o great a misfortune, continue no longer under it than force, fear, or nece&s;&s;ity may be able to oblige them. But as &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ity can hardly lie longer upon a great People, than till the evil be fully di&s;cover'd and comprehended, and their Vertue, Strength and Power be united to expel it; the ill Magi|&s;trate looks upon all things that may conduce to that end, as &s;o many pre|paratives to his ruin; and by the help of tho&s;e who are of his party, will endeavour to prevent that Union, and dimini&s;h that Strength, Ver|tue, Power and Courage, which he knows to be bent again&s;t him. And as truth, faithful dealing, due performance of Contracts, and integrity of Manners, are bonds of Union, and helps to good, he will always by tricks, artifices, cavils, and all means po&s;&s;ible endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h fal&s;hood and di&s;hone&s;ty; whil&s;t other Emi&s;&s;arys and in&s;truments of Ini|quity, by corrupting the Youth, and &s;educing &s;uch as can be brought to leudne&s;s and debauchery, bring the People to &s;uch a pa&s;s, that they may neither care nor dare to vindicate their Rights, and that tho&s;e who would do it, may &s;o far &s;u&s;pect each other, as not to confer upon, much le&s;s to join in any action tending to the publick Deliverance.</P>
<P>This di&s;tingui&s;hes the good from the bad Magi&s;trate, the faithful from the unfaithful; and tho&s;e who adhere to either, living in the &s;ame prin|ciple, mu&s;t walk in the &s;ame ways. They who uphold the rightful power of a ju&s;t Magi&s;tracy, encourage Vertue and Ju&s;tice, and teach men what they ought to do, &s;uffer, or expect from others; they fix them upon principles of Hone&s;ty, and generally advance every thing that tends to the increa&s;e of the valor, &s;trength, greatne&s;s and happine&s;s of the Nation, creating a good Union among them, and bringing every man to an exact under&s;tanding of his own and the publick Rights. On the other &s;ide, he that would introduce an ill Magi&s;trate; make one evil who was good, or pre&s;erve him in the exerci&s;e of inju&s;tice when he is corrup|ted, mu&s;t always open the way for him by vitiating the People, corrupting their Manners, de&s;troying the validity of Oaths and Contracts, teaching &s;uch eva&s;ions, equivocations and frauds, as are incon&s;i&s;tent with the thoughts that become men of vertue and courage; and overthrowing the confidence they ought to have in each other, make it impo&s;&s;ible for them to unite among them&s;elves. The like Arts mu&s;t be us'd with the Magi&s;trate: He cannot be for their turn, till he is per&s;uaded to believe he has no dependence upon, and ows no duty to the People; that he is of him&s;elf, and not by their In&s;titution; that no man ought to inquire into, nor be judg of his actions; that all obedience is due to him, whether he be good or bad, wi&s;e or fooli&s;h, a father or an enemy to his Country. This being calculated for his per&s;onal intere&s;t, he mu&s;t pur&s;ue the &s;ame de&s;igns, or his Kingdom is divided within it &s;elf, and cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t. By this means tho&s;e who flatter his humor, come to be accounted his
<PB N="314" REF="322">
  Friends, and the only men that are thought worthy of great Tru&s;ts, whil&s;t &s;uch as are of another mind are expos'd to all per&s;ecution. The&s;e are always &s;uch as excel in Vertue, Wi&s;dom, and greatne&s;s of Spirit: they have Eyes, and they will always &s;ee the way they go; and leaving fools to be guided by implicit Faith, will di&s;tingui&s;h between good and evil, and chu&s;e that which is be&s;t; they will judg of men by their acti|ons, and by them di&s;covering who&s;e Servant every man is, know whe|ther he is to be obey'd or not. Tho&s;e who are ignorant of all good, care|le&s;s, or enemys to it, take a more compendious way: their &s;lavi&s;h, vi|tious and ba&s;e natures inclining them to &s;eek only private and pre&s;ent ad|vantages, they ea&s;ily &s;lide into a blind dependence upon one who has Wealth and Power; and de&s;iring only to know his will, care not what inju&s;tice they do, if they may be rewarded. They wor&s;hip what they find in the Temple, tho it be the vile&s;t of Idols, and always like that be&s;t which is wor&s;t, becau&s;e it agrees with their inclinations and prin|ciples. When a party comes to be erected on &s;uch a foundation, debau|chery, leudne&s;s and di&s;hone&s;ty are the true badges of it. Such as wear them are cheri&s;h'd; but the principal marks of favor are re&s;erv'd for tho&s;e who are the mo&s;t indu&s;trious in mi&s;chief, either by &s;educing the People with the allurements of &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ures, or corrupting their Under&s;tandings by fal&s;e and &s;lavi&s;h Doctrins. By this means a man who calls him&s;elf a Philo&s;opher or a Divine, is often more u&s;eful than a great number of Tap&s;ters, Cooks, Buffoons, Players, Fidlers, Whores or Bauds. The&s;e are the Devil's Mini&s;ters of a lower Order; they &s;educe &s;ingle Per&s;ons, and &s;uch as fall into their &s;nares are for the mo&s;t part men of the &s;impler &s;ort: but the principal &s;upporters of his Kingdom, are they, who by fal&s;e Doctrins poi&s;on the &s;prings of Religion and Vertue, and by preaching or writing (if their fal&s;hood and wickedne&s;s were not detected) would extingui&s;h all principles of common hone&s;ty, and bring whole Nations to be be&s;t &s;atisfy'd with them&s;elves, when their actions are mo&s;t abominable. And as the means mu&s;t always be &s;utable to the end propos'd, the Governments that are to be e&s;tabli&s;h'd or &s;upported by &s;uch ways mu&s;t needs be the wor&s;t of all, and comprehend all manner of evil.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XX. Unju&s;t Commands are not to be obey'd; and no man is oblig'd to &s;uffer for not obeying &s;uch as are again&s;t Law.</HEAD>
<P>IN the next place our Author gravely propo&s;es a que&s;tion, <HI>Whether it be a &s;in to di&s;obey the King, if he command any thing contrary to Law?</HI> and as gravely determins, <HI>that not only in human Laws, but even in Divine, a thing may be commanded contrary to Law, and yet obedience to &s;uch a Com|mand is nece&s;&s;ary. The &s;anctifying of the Sabbath is a divine Law, yet if a Ma&s;ter command his Servant not to go to Church upon a Sabbath-day, the be&s;t Divines teach us, the Servant mu&s;t obey, &amp;c. It is not &s;it to ty the Ma&s;ter to acquaint the Servant with his &s;ecret Coun&s;el.</HI> Tho he frequently contradicts in one line what he &s;ays in another, this whole Clau&s;e is uniform and &s;utable to the main de&s;ign of his Book. He &s;ets up the au|thority

of Man in oppo&s;ition to the command of God, gives it the pre|ference,   and &s;ays, the be&s;t Divines in&s;truct us &s;o to do. St. <HI>Paul</HI> then mu&s;t have bin one of the wor&s;t, for he knew that the Powers under which he liv'd, had under the &s;evere&s;t penaltys forbidden the publication of the Go&s;pel; and yet he &s;ays, <HI>Wo to me if I preach it not.</HI> St. <HI>Peter</HI> was no better than he, for he tells us, <HI>That it is better to obey God than Man:</HI> and they could not &s;peak otherwi&s;e, unle&s;s they had forgotten the words of their Ma&s;ter, who told them, <HI>They &s;hould not fear them that could on|ly kill the Body, but him who could kill and ca&s;t into Hell.</HI> And if I mu&s;t not fear him that can only kill the Body, not only the rea&s;on, but all ex|cu&s;e for obeying him is taken away.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 14&punc;</NOTE> To prove what he &s;ays, he cites a pertinent Example from St. <HI>Luke,</HI> and very logically concludes, that becau&s;e Chri&s;t approv'd the hypocri&s;y of the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> (who generally adher'd to the external and circum&s;tantial part of the Law, neglecting the e&s;&s;ential, and taking upon them&s;elves to be the interpreters of that which they did not under&s;tand) the Law of God is not to be obey'd: and as &s;trongly proves, that becau&s;e Chri&s;t &s;hew'd them that the &s;ame Law, which by their own confe&s;&s;ion permit|ted them to pull an A&s;s out of a pit on the Sabbath-day, could not but give a liberty of healing the &s;ick, therefore the commands of Kings are to be obey'd, tho they &s;hould be contrary to human and divine Laws. But if perver&s;ene&s;s had not blinded him, he might have &s;een, that this very Text is wholly again&s;t his purpo&s;e; for the Magi&s;tratical Power was on the &s;ide of the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> otherwi&s;e they would not have &s;ought an occa&s;ion to en&s;nare him; and that power having perverted the Law of God by fal&s;e glo&s;&s;es, and a &s;uperinduction of human Traditions, pro|hibited the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary acts of Charity to be done on the Sabbath|day, which Chri&s;t reprov'd, and re&s;tor'd the &s;ick man to his health in their &s;ight.</P>
<P>But I could wi&s;h our Author had told us the names of tho&s;e Divines, who, he &s;ays, are the be&s;t, and who pretend to teach us the&s;e fine things. I know &s;ome who are thought good, that are of a contrary opinion, and &s;ay, that God having requir'd that Day to be &s;et apart for his Service and Wor&s;hip, man cannot di&s;pen&s;e with the Obligation, unle&s;s he can abro|gate the Law of God. Perhaps, for want of other Arguments to prove the contrary, I may be told, that this &s;avours too much of Puritani&s;m and Calvini&s;m. But I &s;hall take the reproach, till &s;ome better Patrons than <HI>Laud</HI> and his creatures may be found for the other opinion. By the advice and in&s;tigation of the&s;e men, from about the year 1630, to 1640, &s;ports and revelings, which ended for the mo&s;t part in drunkenne&s;s and leudne&s;s, were not only permitted on that day, but enjoin'd. And tho this did advance human Authority in derogation to the Divine, to a de|gree that may plea&s;e &s;uch as are of our Author's mind, yet others re&s;olv|ing rather to obey the Laws of God than the Commands of Men, could not be brought to pa&s;s the Lord's day in that manner. Since that time no man except <HI>Filmer</HI> and <HI>Heylin</HI> have bin &s;o wicked to conceive, or &s;o impudent to a&s;&s;ert &s;uch brutal ab&s;urditys. But leaving the farther con|&s;ideration of the original of this abu&s;e, I de&s;ire to know, whether the Authority given to Ma&s;ters to command things contrary to the Law of God, be peculiar in relation to the Sabbath, or to a few other points, or ought generally to extend to all God's Laws; and whether he who may command his Servant to act contrary to the Law of God, have not a right in him&s;elf of doing the &s;ame. If peculiar, &s;ome Authority or Pre|cept
<PB N="316" REF="324">
  mu&s;t be produc'd, by which it may appear that God has &s;lighted his Ordinance concerning that Day, and &s;uffer'd it to be contemn'd, whil&s;t he exacts obedience to all others. If we have a liberty left to us of &s;light|ing others al&s;o, more or le&s;s in number, we ought to know how many, what they are, and how it comes to pa&s;s, that &s;ome are of obligation and others not. If the Empire of the world is not only divided between God and <HI>Ce&s;ar,</HI> but every man al&s;o who can give five pounds a year to a Servant, has &s;o great a part in it, that in &s;ome ca&s;es his commands are to be obey'd preferably to tho&s;e of God, it were fit to know the limits of each Kingdom, le&s;t we happen prepo&s;terou&s;ly to obey man when we ought to obey God, or God when we are to follow the commands of men. If it be general, the Law of God is of no effect, and we may &s;afely put an end to all thoughts and di&s;cour&s;es of Religion: the word of God is nothing to us; we are not to inquire what he has commanded, but what plea&s;es our Ma&s;ter, how in&s;olent, fooli&s;h, vile or wicked &s;o|ever he may be. The Apo&s;tles and Prophets who dy'd for preferring the commands of God before tho&s;e of men, fell like fools, and peri&s;h'd in their &s;ins. But if every particular man that has a &s;ervant, can exempt him from the commands of God, he may al&s;o exempt him&s;elf, and the Laws of God are at once abrogated throout the world.</P>
<P>'Tis a folly to &s;ay there is a pa&s;&s;ive, as well as an active Obedience, and that he who will not do what his Ma&s;ter commands ought to &s;uffer the puni&s;hment he inflicts: for if the Ma&s;ter has a right of commanding, there is a duty incumbent on the &s;ervant of obeying. He that &s;uffers for not doing that which he ought to do, draws upon him&s;elf both the guilt and the puni&s;hment. But no one can be oblig'd to &s;uffer for that which he ought not to do, becau&s;e he who pretends to command, has not &s;o far an Authority. However, our que&s;tion is, whether the Servant &s;hould forbear to do that which God commands, rather than whether the Ma&s;ter &s;hould put away or beat him if he do not: for if the Servant ought to obey his Ma&s;ter rather than God, as our Author &s;ays the be&s;t Divines a&s;&s;ert, he &s;ins in di&s;obeying, and that guilt cannot be expiated by his &s;uf|fering. If it be thought I carry this point to an undue extremity, the limits ought to be demon&s;trated, by which it may appear that I exceed them, tho the nature of the ca&s;e cannot be alter'd: for if the Law of God may not be abrogated by the commands of men, a Servant cannot be exempted from keeping the Sabbath according to the Ordinance of God, at the will of his Ma&s;ter. But if a power be given to man at his plea&s;ure to annul the Laws of God, the Apo&s;tles ought not to have preach'd, when they were forbidden by the Powers to which they were &s;ubject: The tortures and deaths they &s;uffer'd for not obeying that com|mand were in their own wrong, and their blood was upon their own heads.</P>
<P>His &s;econd in&s;tance concerning Wars, in which he &s;ays the Subject is not to examin whether they are ju&s;t or unju&s;t, but mu&s;t obey, is weak and frivolous, and very often fal&s;e; whereas con&s;equences can rightly be drawn from &s;uch things only as are certainly and univer&s;ally true. Tho God may be merciful to a Soldier, who by the wickedne&s;s of a Magi|&s;trate whom he hone&s;tly tru&s;ts, is made a Mini&s;ter of inju&s;tice, 'tis nothing to this ca&s;e. For if our Author &s;ay true, that the word of a King can ju&s;tify him in going again&s;t the command of God, he mu&s;t do what is commanded tho he think it evil: The Chri&s;tian Soldiers under the Pagan Emperors were oblig'd to de&s;troy their Brethren, and the be&s;t
<PB N="317" REF="325">
men in the world for being &s;o: Such as now live under the <HI>Turk</HI> have the   &s;ame obligation upon them of defending their Ma&s;ter, and &s;laughtering tho&s;e he reputes his Enemys for adhering to Chri&s;tianity: And the King of <HI>France</HI> may when he plea&s;es, arm one part of his Prote&s;tant Subjects to the de&s;truction of the other; which is a godly doctrin, and worthy our Author's invention.</P>
<P>But if this be &s;o, I know not how the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> can be &s;aid to have &s;inn'd in following the examples of <HI>Jeroboam, Omri, Ahab,</HI> or other wicked Kings: they could not have &s;inn'd in obeying, if it had bin a &s;in to di&s;obey their commands; and God would not have puni&s;h'd them &s;o &s;everely, if they had not &s;inn'd. 'Tis impertinent to &s;ay they were oblig'd to &s;erve their Kings in unju&s;t Wars, but not to &s;erve Idols; for tho God be jealous of his glory, yet he forbids Rapine and Murder as well as Idolatry. If there be a Law that forbids the Subject to examin the com|mands tending to the one, it cannot but enjoin obedience to the other. The &s;ame Authority which ju&s;tifys Murder, takes away the guilt of Idolatry; and the Wretches, both Judges and Witne&s;&s;es, who put <HI>Naboth</HI> to death, could as little alledg ignorance, as tho&s;e that wor&s;hip'd <HI>Jeroboam</HI>'s Calves; the &s;ame light of Nature by which they &s;hould have known, that a ridi|culous Image was not to be ador'd as God, in&s;tructing them al&s;o, that an innocent man ought not under pretence of Law to be murder'd by per|jury.</P>

<P>THAT we may not be di&s;pleas'd, or think it dangerous and &s;lavi&s;h to depend upon the will of a man, which perhaps may be irregu|lar or extravagant in one who is &s;ubject to no Law, our Author very dex|trou&s;ly removes the &s;cruples by telling us,</P>

<P>But nothing can be more ab&s;urd than to &s;ay, that one man has an ab&s;o|lute power above Law to govern according to his will, <HI>for the Peoples good, and the pre&s;ervation of their Liberty:</HI> For no Liberty can &s;ub&s;i&s;t where there is &s;uch a Power; and we have no other way of di&s;tingui&s;h|ing between free Nations and &s;uch as are not &s;o, than that the free are govern'd by their own Laws and Magi&s;trats according to their own mind, and that the others either have willingly &s;ubjected them&s;elves, or are by force brought under the power of one or more men, to be rul'd accord|ing to his or their plea&s;ure. The &s;ame di&s;tinction holds in relation to particular per&s;ons. He is a free man who lives as be&s;t plea&s;es him&s;elf, under Laws made by his own con&s;ent; and the name of &s;lave can belong to no man, unle&s;s to him who is either born in the hou&s;e of a Ma&s;ter, bought, taken, &s;ubdu'd, or willingly gives his ear to be nail'd to the po&s;t, and &s;ubjects him&s;elf to the will of another. Thus were the <HI>Gre|cians</HI> &s;aid to be free in oppo&s;ition to the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> as <HI>Artabanus</HI> acknowledg'd in his Di&s;cour&s;e to <HI>Themi&s;tocles.</HI> In the &s;ame manner the <HI>Italians, Germans</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> were di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the Ea&s;tern Na|tions. who for the mo&s;t part were under the power of Tyrants. <HI>Rome</HI> was &s;aid to have recover'd liberty by the expul&s;ion of the <HI>Tarquins;</HI> or, as <HI>Tacitus</HI> expre&s;&s;es it, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Libertatem &amp; Con&s;ulatum L.

may be beaten and kill'd whenever it plea&s;es their in&s;olent Ma&s;ters, are   Free-men. But &s;urely the world is not &s;o much mi&s;taken in the &s;ignifi|cation of words and things. The weight of Chains, number of Stripes, hardne&s;s of labor, and other effects of a Ma&s;ter's cruelty, may make one &s;ervitude more mi&s;erable than another: but he is a &s;lave who &s;erves the be&s;t and gentle&s;t man in the world, as well as he who &s;erves the wor&s;t; and he dos &s;erve him if he mu&s;t obey his commands, and depends upon his will. For this rea&s;on the Poet ingeniou&s;ly flattering a good Emperor, &s;aid, that Liberty was not more de&s;irable, than to &s;erve a gentle Ma&s;ter; but &s;till acknowledg'd that it was a &s;ervice, di&s;tinct from, and contrary to Liberty: and it had not bin a hand&s;om complement, unle&s;s the evil of &s;ervitude were &s;o extreme, that nothing but the vertue and goodne&s;s of the Ma&s;ter could any way compen&s;ate or alleviate it. Now tho it &s;hould be granted that he had &s;poken more like to a Philo&s;opher than a Poet; that we might take his words in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e, and think it po&s;&s;ible to find &s;uch Conveniences in a &s;ubjection to the will of a good and wi&s;e Ma&s;ter, as may balance the lo&s;s of Liberty, it would be no|thing to the que&s;tion; becau&s;e that Liberty is thereby acknowledg'd to be de&s;troy'd by the Prerogative, which is only in&s;tituted to pre&s;erve it. If it were true, that no liberty were to be prefer'd before the &s;ervice of a good Ma&s;ter, it could be of no u&s;e to the peri&s;hing world, which <HI>Filmer</HI> and his Di&s;ciples would by &s;uch arguments bring into a &s;ubjection to children, fools, mad or vicious men. The&s;e are not ca&s;es feign'd upon a di&s;tant imaginary po&s;&s;ibility, but &s;o frequently found among&s;t men, that there are few examples of the contrary. And as 'tis folly to &s;uppo&s;e that Princes will always be wi&s;e, ju&s;t and good, when we know that few have bin able alone to bear the weight of a Government, or to re&s;i&s;t the temptations to ill, that accompany an unlimited power, it would be madne&s;s to pre&s;ume they will for the future be free from infirmitys and vices. And if they be not, the Nations under them will not be in &s;uch a condition of &s;ervitude to a good Ma&s;ter as the Poet compares to Liberty, but in a mi&s;erable and &s;hameful &s;ubjection to the will of tho&s;e who know not how to govern them&s;elves, or to do good to others. Tho <HI>Mo&s;es, Jo&s;hua</HI> and <HI>Samuel</HI> had bin able to bear the weight of an unre&s;train'd Power: tho <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Solomon</HI> had never abus'd that which they had; what effect could this have upon a general Propo&s;ition? Where are the Familys that always produce &s;uch as they were? When did God pro|mi&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t all tho&s;e who &s;hould attain to the Sovereign Power, as he did them whom he cho&s;e for the works he de&s;ign'd? Or what te&s;timony can <HI>Filmer</HI> give us, that he has bin pre&s;ent with all tho&s;e who have hi|therto reign'd in the world? But if we know that no &s;uch thing either is, or has bin; and can find no promi&s;e to a&s;&s;ure us, nor rea&s;on to hope that it ever will be, 'tis as fooli&s;h to found the hopes of pre&s;erving a People upon that which never was, or is &s;o likely to fail, nay rather which in a &s;hort time mo&s;t certainly will fail, as to root up Vines and Figtrees in expectation of gathering grapes and figs from thi&s;tles and briars. This would be no le&s;s than to extingui&s;h the light of common &s;en&s;e, to neglect the means that God has given us to provide for our &s;ecu|rity, and to impute to him a di&s;po&s;ition of things utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with his Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s. If he has not therefore order'd that thorns and thi&s;tles &s;hould produce figs and grapes, nor that the mo&s;t important works in the world, which are not without the utmo&s;t difficulty, if at all, to be perform'd by the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of men, &s;hould be put into

And if men cannot be guilty of &s;o great an ab&s;urdity to tru&s;t the weake&s;t and wor&s;t with a Power which u&s;ually &s;ubverts the Wi&s;dom and Vertue of the be&s;t; or to expect &s;uch effects of Vertue and Wi&s;dom from tho&s;e who come by chance, as can hardly, if at all, be hop'd from the mo&s;t excellent; our Author's Propo&s;ition can neither be grounded upon the Ordinance of God, nor the In&s;titution of men. Nay, if any &s;uch thing had bin e&s;tabli&s;h'd by our fir&s;t Parents in their &s;implicity, the utter impo&s;&s;ibility of attaining what they expected from it, mu&s;t wholly have abrogated the E&s;tabli&s;hment: Or rather, it had bin void from the beginning, becau&s;e it was not <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sanctio recta, jubens hone&s;ta, prohibens <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ontra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ia. <BIBL>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">er.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>a ju&s;t Sanction, commanding things good, and forbidding the contrary,</HI> but a fooli&s;h and per|ver&s;e Sanction, &s;etting up the unruly appetites of one per&s;on to the &s;ub|ver&s;ion of all that is good in the world, by making the wi&s;dom of the aged and experienc'd to depend upon the will of Women, Children and Fools; by &s;ending the &s;trong and the brave to &s;eek protection from the mo&s;t weak and cowardly, and &s;ubjecting the mo&s;t vertuous and be&s;t of men to be de&s;troy'd by the mo&s;t wicked and vicious. The&s;e being the effects of that unlimited prerogative, which our Author &s;ays was only in&s;tituted for the good and defence of the people, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily fall to the ground, unle&s;s &s;lavery, mi&s;ery, infamy, de&s;truction and de&s;olation tend to the pre&s;ervation of Liberty, and are to be prefer'd before &s;trength, glory, plenty, &s;ecurity and happine&s;s. The &s;tate of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire after the U&s;urpation of <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> will &s;et this matter in the cleare&s;t light; but having done it already in the former parts of this work, I content my &s;elf to refer to tho&s;e places. And tho the Calamitys they &s;uffer'd were a little allay'd and moderated by the Vertues of <HI>Antoninus</HI> and <HI>M.

<P>But &s;ays our Author, <HI>there can be no Law where there is not a &s;upreme Power;</HI> and from thence very &s;trongly concludes it mu&s;t be in the King; for <HI>otherwi&s;e there can be no Sovereign Maje&s;ty in him, and he is but an equi|vocal King.</HI> This might have bin of &s;ome force, if Governments were e&s;tabli&s;h'd, and Laws made only to advance that Sovereign Maje&s;ty; but nothing at all to the purpo&s;e, if (as he confe&s;&s;es) the power which he has be given for the good of the People, and for the defence of every private man's Life, Liberty, Lands and Goods: for that which is in&s;ti|tuted, cannot be abrogated for want of that which was never intended in the in&s;titution.

But what is this Sovereign Maje&s;ty, &s;o in&s;eparable from Royalty, that   one cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without the other? <HI>Caligula</HI> plac'd it in a power of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Omnia mihi in omnes licere. <BIBL>Sueton.</BIBL></NOTE>doing what he pleas'd to all men: <HI>Nimrod, Nabuchodono&s;or</HI> and others, with an impious and barbarous in&s;olence, boa&s;ted of the greatne&s;s of their power. They thought it a glorious Privilege to kill or &s;pare whom they pleas'd. But &s;uch Kings as by God's permi&s;&s;ion might have bin &s;et up over his people, were to have nothing of this. They were not to multiply Gold, Silver, Wives or Hor&s;es; they were not to govern by <NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 17.</NOTE>their own will, but according to the Law; from which they might not recede, nor rai&s;e their Hearts above their brethren. Here were Kings without that unlimited Power, which makes up the Sovereign Maje&s;ty, that <HI>Filmer</HI> affirms to be &s;o e&s;&s;ential to Kings, that without it they are only equivocal; which proving nothing but the incurable perver&s;ne&s;s of his judgment, the malice of his heart or malignity of his fate, always to oppo&s;e rea&s;on and truth, we are to e&s;teem tho&s;e to be Kings who are de&s;crib'd to be &s;o by the Scriptures, and to give another name to tho&s;e who endeavour to advance their own glory, contrary to the precept of God and the intere&s;t of mankind.</P>
<P>But unle&s;s the light of rea&s;on had bin extingui&s;h'd in him, he might have &s;een, that tho no Law could be made without a &s;upreme Power, that Supremacy may be in a Body con&s;i&s;ting of many men, and &s;everal orders of men. If it be true, which perhaps may be doubted, that there have bin in the world &s;imple Monarchys, Ari&s;tocracys or Democracys legally e&s;tabli&s;h'd, 'tis certain that the mo&s;t part of the Governments of the world (and I think all that are or have bin good) were mix'd. Part of the Power has bin confer'd upon the King, or the Magi&s;trate that repre&s;ented him, and part upon the Senat and People, as has bin prov'd in relation to the Governments of the <HI>Hebrews, Spar|tans, Romans, Venetians, Germans,</HI> and all tho&s;e who live under that which is u&s;ually call'd the Gothic Polity. If the &s;ingle Per&s;on participa|ting of this divided Power di&s;like either the Name he bears, or the Au|thority he has, he may renounce it; but no rea&s;on can be from thence drawn to the prejudice of Nations, who give &s;o much as they think con|&s;i&s;tent with their own good, and re&s;erve the re&s;t to them&s;elves, or to &s;uch other Officers as they plea&s;e to e&s;tabli&s;h.</P>
<P>No man will deny that &s;everal Nations have had a right of giving power to Con&s;uls, Dictators, Archons, Suffetes, Dukes and other Ma|gi&s;trats, in &s;uch proportions as &s;eem'd mo&s;t conducing to their own good; and there mu&s;t be a right in every Nation of allotting to Kings &s;o much as they plea&s;e, as well as to the others, unle&s;s there be a charm in the word King, or in the Letters that compo&s;e it. But this cannot be; for there is no &s;imilitude between <HI>King, Rex,</HI> and <HI>Ba&s;ileus:</HI> they mu&s;t there|fore have a right of regulating the Power of Kings, as well as that of Con&s;uls or Dictators; and it had not bin more ridiculous in <HI>Fabius, Sci|pio, Camillus</HI> or <HI>Cincinnatus,</HI> to a&s;&s;ert an ab&s;olute power in him&s;elf, under pretence of advancing his Sovereign Maje&s;ty again&s;t the Law, than for any King to do the like. But as all Nations give what form they plea&s;e to their Government, they are al&s;o judges of the name to be impos'd upon each man who is to have a part in the power: and 'tis as lawful for us to call him King, who has a limited Authority among&s;t us, as for the <HI>Medes</HI> or <HI>Arabs</HI> to give the &s;ame name to one who is more ab&s;olute.
<PB N="322" REF="330">
  If this be not admitted, we are content to &s;peak improperly, but utterly deny that when we give the name, we give any thing more than we plea&s;e; and had rather his Maje&s;ty &s;hould change his name than to renounce our own Rights and Libertys which he is to pre&s;erve, and which we have re|ceiv'd from God and Nature.</P>
<P>But that the folly and wickedne&s;s of our Author may not be capable of any farther aggravation, he &s;ays, <HI>That it skills not how he come by the power.</HI> Violence therefore or fraud, treachery or murder, are as good as Election, Donation, or legal Succe&s;&s;ion.

Our Author tells us in &s;hort, it matters not how he that has the power comes by it.</P>
<P>It has bin hitherto thought, that to kill a King (e&s;pecially a good King) was a mo&s;t abominable action. They who did it, were thought to be incited by the wor&s;t of pa&s;&s;ions that can enter into the hearts of men; and the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hments have bin invented to deter them from &s;uch attempts, or to avenge their death upon tho&s;e who &s;hould accompli&s;h it. But if our Author may be credited, it mu&s;t be the mo&s;t commendable and glorious act that can be perform'd by man: for be&s;ides the outward ad|vantages that men &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ire, he that dos it, is pre&s;ently inve&s;ted with the Sovereign Maje&s;ty, and at the &s;ame time becomes God's Vice|gerent, and the father of his Country, po&s;&s;e&s;t of that Government, which in exclu&s;ion to all other forms is only favour'd by the Laws of God and Nature. The only inconvenience is, that all depends upon &s;ucce&s;s, and he that is to be the Mini&s;ter of God, and father of his Country if he &s;ucceed, is the wor&s;t of all villains if he fail; and at the be&s;t may be depriv'd of all by the &s;ame means he employ'd to gain it. Tho a Prince &s;hould have the wi&s;dom and vertues of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> the valor of <HI>Jo&s;hua, Da|vid</HI> and the <HI>Maccabees,</HI> with the gentlene&s;s and integrity of <HI>Samuel,</HI> the mo&s;t fooli&s;h, vitious, ba&s;e and dete&s;table man in the world that kills him, and &s;eizes the power, becomes his Heir, and father of the People that he govern'd; it <HI>skills</HI> not how he did it, whether in open battel or &s;ecret treachery, in the field or in the bed, by poi&s;on or by the &s;word: The vile&s;t &s;lave in <HI>I&s;rael</HI> had become the Lord's anointed, if he could have kill'd <HI>David</HI> or <HI>Solomon,</HI> and found villains to place him in the Throne. If this be right, the world has to this day liv'd in darkne&s;s, and the actions which have bin thought to be the mo&s;t dete&s;table, are the mo&s;t commendable and glorious. But not troubling my &s;elf at pre|&s;ent to decide this que&s;tion, I leave it to Kings to con&s;ider how much they are beholden to <HI>Filmer</HI> and his di&s;ciples, who &s;et &s;uch a price upon their heads, as would render it hard to pre&s;erve their Lives one day, if the Doctrins were receiv'd, which they endeavour to infu&s;e into the Minds of the People; and concluding this point, only &s;ay, that we in <HI>England</HI> know no other King than he who is &s;o by Law, nor any power in that King except that which he has by Law: And tho the Roman Empire was held by the power of the Sword; and <HI>&V;lpian</HI> a corrupt Lawyer undertakes to fay, that <HI>the Prince is not oblig'd by the Laws;</HI> yet <HI>Theodo&s;ius</HI> con&s;e&s;t, that it was the glory of a good Emperor to acknowledg him&s;elf bound by them.</P>

<P>OUR Author's next &s;hift is to place the King above the Law, that he may mitigate the rigor of it, without which, he &s;ays, <HI>the ca&s;e of the Subject would be de&s;perately mi&s;erable.</HI> But this cure would prove wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e.

The wi&s;dom of Nations has provided more a&s;&s;ured helps; and none could have bin &s;o bruti&s;h and negligent of the publick Concern|ments, to &s;uffer the Succe&s;&s;ion to fall to women, children, &amp;c. if they had not re&s;erv'd a power in them&s;elves to prefer others before the neare&s;t in blood, if rea&s;on require; and pre&s;crib'd &s;uch rules as might pre&s;erve the publick from ruin, notwith&s;tanding their infirmitys and vices. The&s;e helps provided by our Laws, are principally by grand and petit Jurys, who are not only Judges of matters of fact, as whether a man be kill'd, but whether he be kill'd criminally. The&s;e Men are upon their Oaths, and may be indicted of Perjury if they prevaricate: The Judges are pre&s;ent not only to be a check upon them, but to explain &s;uch points of the Law as may &s;eem difficult. And tho the&s;e Judges may be &s;aid in &s;ome &s;en&s;e to be cho&s;en by the King, he is not under&s;tood to do it otherwi&s;e than by the advice of his Council, who cannot perform their duty, unle&s;s they propo&s;e &s;uch as in their con&s;ciences they think mo&s;t worthy of the Office, and mo&s;t capable of performing the duty rightly; nor he accompli&s;h the Oath of his Coronation, unle&s;s he admit tho&s;e, who upon deliberation &s;eem to be the be&s;t.

And be&s;ides the offence again&s;t God, their Country, and the Commonwealth, they alledg'd the example of <HI>Emp&s;on</HI> and <HI>Dudley, whereby,</HI> they &s;aid, <HI>they were deter'd from obeying her illegal Commands.</HI> They who had &s;worn to keep the Law notwith&s;tanding the King's Writs, knew that the Law depended not upon his will: and the &s;ame Oath that oblig'd them not to regard any command they &s;hould receive from him, &s;hew'd that they were not to expect indemnity by it; and not only that the King had neither the power of making, altering, miti|gating or interpreting the Law, but that he was not at all to be heard, in general or particular matters, otherwi&s;e than as he &s;peaks in the com|mon cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice, by the Courts legally e&s;tabli&s;h'd, which &s;ay the &s;ame thing, whether he be young or old, ignorant or wi&s;e, wicked or good. And nothing dos better evidence the wi&s;dom and care of our Ance&s;tors, in framing the Laws and Government we live under, than that the People did not &s;uffer extremitys by the vices or infirmitys of Kings, till an Age more full of malice than tho&s;e in which they liv'd, had found tricks to pervert the rule, and fru&s;trate their hone&s;t intentions. It was not &s;afe for the Kings to violate their Oaths by an undue inter|po&s;ition of their Authority; but the Mini&s;ters who &s;erv'd them in tho&s;e violations, have &s;eldom e&s;cap'd puni&s;hment. This is to be under&s;tood when the deviations from Ju&s;tice are extreme and mi&s;chievous, for &s;ome|thing mu&s;t always be allow'd to human frailty: The be&s;t have their defects, and none could &s;tand if a too exact &s;crutiny were made of all their actions. <HI>Edward</HI> the third, about the twentieth year of his Reign, acknowledg'd his own in Parliament, and as well for the ea&s;e of his Con&s;cience, as the &s;atisfaction of his People, promoted an Act, <HI>Com|manding all Judges to do Ju&s;tice, notwith&s;tanding any Writs, Letters or Com|mands from him&s;elf; and forbidding tho&s;e that belong'd to the King, Queen and Prince, to intermeddle in tho&s;e matters.</HI> But if the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of our Princes, in the &s;trength and maturity of their years, had their failings, and every act proceeding from them that tended to the interruption of Ju&s;tice was a failing, how can it be &s;aid that the King in his per&s;onal ca|pacity, directly or indirectly, may enter into the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the&s;e mat|ters, much le&s;s to determin them according to his will?</P>
<P><HI>But,</HI> &s;ays our Author, <HI>the Law is no better than a Tyrant; general Pardons at the Coronation and in Parliament, are but the bounty of the Pre|rogative,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>There may be hard ca&s;es:</HI> and citing &s;ome perverted pieces from <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s Ethicks and Politicks, adds, <HI>That when &s;omething falls out be&s;ides the general rule, then it is fit that what the Lawmaker has omitted, or where he has err'd by &s;peaking generally, it &s;hould be corrected and &s;upply'd, as if the Lawmaker were pre&s;ent that ordain'd it. The Go|vernor, whether he be one man or more, ought to be Lord of the&s;e things, whereof it was impo&s;&s;ible that the Law &s;hould &s;peak exactly.</HI> The&s;e things are in part true; but our Author makes u&s;e of them as the Devil dos of Scripture, to &s;ubvert the truth. There may be &s;omething of rigor in the Law, that in &s;ome ca&s;es may be mitigated; and the Law it &s;elf (in relation to <HI>England)</HI> dos &s;o far acknowledg it, as to refer much to the con&s;ciences of Jurys, and tho&s;e who are appointed to a&s;&s;i&s;t them; and the mo&s;t difficult Ca&s;es are refer'd to the Parliament as the only judges that are able to determin them.
<PB N="325" REF="333">
Thus the Statute of 35 <HI>Edw.</HI> III. enumerating the crimes then declar'd   to be Trea&s;on, leaves to future Parliaments to judg what other facts equivalent to them may de&s;erve the &s;ame puni&s;hment: and 'tis a general rule in the Law, which the Judges are &s;worn to ob&s;erve, that difficult Ca&s;es &s;hould be re&s;erv'd till the Parliament meet, who are only able to decide them: and if there be any inconvenience in this, 'tis becau&s;e they do not meet &s;o frequently as the Law requires, or by &s;ini&s;ter means are interrupted in their &s;itting. But nothing can be more ab&s;urd than to &s;ay, that becau&s;e the King dos not call Parliaments as the Law and his Oath requires, that power &s;hould accrue to him, which the Law and the con&s;ent of the Nation has plac'd in them.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o &s;uch a thing in the Law as a general or particular Par|don, and the King may in &s;ome degree be entru&s;ted with the power of giving it, e&s;pecially for &s;uch crimes as merely relate to him&s;elf, as every man may remit the injurys done to him&s;elf; but the confe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>That the Oath of the Crown had not bin kept by rea&s;on of</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">14 Edw. 3. 15.</NOTE><HI>the grant of Pardons contrary to Statutes,</HI> and a new Act made, <HI>that all &s;uch Charters of Pardon from henceforth granted again&s;t the Oath of the Crown and the &s;aid Statutes, &s;hould be held for none,</HI> demon&s;trates that this power was not in him&s;elf, but granted by the Nation, and to be executed according to &s;uch rules as the Law pre&s;crib'd, and the Parlia|ment approv'd.</P>
<P>Moreover, there have bin many, and &s;ometimes bloody conte&s;ts for the Crown, upon which the Nation was almo&s;t equally divided; and it being difficult for them to know, or even for us who have all the partys before us, to judg which was the better &s;ide, it was under&s;tood that he who came to be crown'd by the con&s;ent of the People, was acceptable to all: and the que&s;tion being determin'd, it was no way fit that he &s;hould have a liberty to make u&s;e of the publick Authority then in his hands, to revenge &s;uch per&s;onal injurys as he had, or might &s;uppo&s;e to have receiv'd, which might rai&s;e new, and perhaps more dan|gerous troubles, if the Authors of them were &s;till kept in fear of being pro&s;ecuted; and nothing could be more unrea&s;onable than that he &s;hould employ his power to the de&s;truction of tho&s;e who had con&s;ented to make him King. This made it a matter of cour&s;e for a King, as &s;oon as he was crown'd, to i&s;&s;ue out a general Pardon, which was no more than to declare, that being now what he was not before, he had no enemy upon any former account. For this rea&s;on <HI>Lewis</HI> the twelfth of <HI>France,</HI> when he was incited to revenge him&s;elf again&s;t tho&s;e, who in the reign of his Predece&s;&s;or <HI>Charles</HI> the eighth had caus'd him to be impri&s;on'd with great danger of his life, made this an&s;wer, <HI>That the King of</HI> France <HI>did not care to revenge the injurys done to the Duke of</HI> Orleans: and the la&s;t King of <HI>Sweden</HI> &s;eem'd no otherwi&s;e to remember who had oppos'd the Queen's Abdication and his Election, than by conferring honors upon them; becau&s;e he knew they were the be&s;t men of the Nation, and &s;uch as would be his friends when they &s;hould &s;ee how he would govern, in which he was not deceiv'd. But le&s;t all tho&s;e who might come to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> &s;hould not have the &s;ame prudence and genero&s;ity, the Kings were oblig'd by a Cu&s;tom of no le&s;s force than a Law, immediately to put an end to all di&s;putes, and the inconveniences that might ari&s;e from them. This did not proceed from the bounty of the Prerogative (which I think is non&s;en&s;e, for tho he that enjoys the Prerogative may have bounty,
<PB N="326" REF="334">
  the Prerogative can have none) but from common &s;en&s;e, from the King's obligation, and the care of his own &s;afety; and could have no other effect in Law, than what related to his per&s;on, as appears by the fore|mention'd Statute.</P>
<P>Pardons granted by Act of Parliament are of another nature: For as the King who has no other power than by Law, can no otherwi&s;e di&s;|pen&s;e with the crimes committed again&s;t the Laws, than the Law dos enable him; the Parliament that has the power of making Laws, may intirely aboli&s;h the crimes, and unque&s;tionably remit the puni&s;hment as they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Tho &s;ome words of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s Ethicks are without any coherence &s;huffled together by our Author, with others taken out of his Politicks, I do not much except again&s;t them. No Law made by man can be per|fect, and there mu&s;t be in every Nation a power of correcting &s;uch de|fects as in time may ari&s;e or be di&s;cover'd. This power can never be &s;o rightly plac'd as <HI>in the &s;ame Hand that has the right of making Laws, whe|ther in one per&s;on or in many.</HI> If <HI>Filmer</HI> therefore can tell us of a place, where one man, woman or child, however he or &s;he be qualify'd, has the power of making Laws, I will acknowledg that not only the <HI>hard Ca&s;es,</HI> but as many others as he plea&s;es, are refer'd to his or her judgment, and that they may give it, whether they have any under&s;tanding of what they do or not, whether they be drunk or &s;ober, in their &s;en&s;es or &s;tark mad. But as I know no &s;uch place, and &s;hould not be much concern'd for the &s;ufferings of a People that might bring &s;uch mi&s;ery upon them&s;elves, as mu&s;t accompany an ab&s;olute dependence upon the unruly will of &s;uch a creature, I may leave him to &s;eek it, and re&s;t in a perfect a&s;&s;urance that he dos not &s;peak of <HI>England,</HI> which acknowledges no other Law than its own; and in&s;tead of receiving any from Kings, dos to this day obey none, but &s;uch as have bin made by our Ance&s;tors, or our &s;elves, and never admitted any King that did not &s;wear to ob&s;erve them. And if <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> de&s;erve credit, the power of altering, mitigating, explaining or correcting the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> is only in the Parliament, <HI>becau&s;e none but the</HI> Parliament <HI>can make them.</HI></P>

<P>OUR Author having fal&s;ly cited and perverted the &s;en&s;e of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> now brings him in &s;aying, <HI>That a perfect Kingdom is that wherein the King rules all according to his own Will.</HI> But tho I have read his books of Government with &s;ome attention, I can find no &s;uch thing in them, unle&s;s the word which &s;ignifies <HI>mere</HI> or <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> may be ju&s;tly tran&s;lated into <HI>perfect:</HI> which is &s;o far from <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s meaning, that he di&s;tingui&s;h|es the ab&s;olute or de&s;potical Kingdoms from the Legitimate; and com|mending the latter, gives no better name than that of <HI>barbarous</HI> to the fir&s;t, which he &s;ays can agree only with the nature of &s;uch Nations as are ba&s;e and &s;tupid, little differing from Bea&s;ts; and having no skill to

govern, or courage to defend them&s;elves, mu&s;t re&s;ign all to the will of   one that will take care of them. Yet even this cannot be done, unle&s;s he that &s;hould take that care be wholly exempted from the vices which oblige the others to &s;tand in need of it: for otherwi&s;e 'tis no better than if a Sheep &s;hould undertake to govern Sheep, or a Hog to command Swine; <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> plainly &s;aying, <HI>That as men are by nature equal, if it were</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Polit. l. 2. c. 1.</NOTE><HI>po&s;&s;ible all &s;hould be Magi&s;trats.</HI> But that being repugnant to the nature of Government, he finds no other way of &s;olving the difficulty, than by <HI>obeying and commanding alternately;</HI> that they may do by turns that which they cannot do all together, and to which no one man has more right than another, becau&s;e they are all by nature equal. This might be com|pos'd by a more compendious way, if, according to our Author's doctrin, Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion could give a Right. But <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> &s;peaking like a Philo&s;opher, and not like a publick Enemy to Mankind, examins what is ju&s;t, rea&s;on|able and beneficial to men; that is, what ought to be done, and which being done, is to be accounted ju&s;t, and therefore to be &s;upported by good men. But as <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quod ab initio inju&s;tum e&s;t, nullum pote&s;t habere juris effectum. <BIBL>Grot. de jur. bel. &amp; pac. l. <HI>3.</HI></BIBL></NOTE><HI>that which is unju&s;t in the beginning, can never have the effect of Ju&s;tice;</HI> and it being manife&s;tly unju&s;t for one or a few men to a&s;&s;ume a power over tho&s;e who by nature are equal to them, no &s;uch power can be ju&s;t or beneficial to mankind; nor fit to be upheld by good men, if it be unju&s;t and prejudicial. In the opinion of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> this natural equality continues till vertue makes the di&s;tinction; which mu&s;t be either &s;imply compleat and perfect in it &s;elf, &s;o that he who is endu'd with it, is a God among men, or relatively, as far as concerns civil Socie|ty, and the ends for which it is con&s;tituted, that is, defence, and the ob|taining of Ju&s;tice. This requires a mind unbia&s;s'd by pa&s;&s;ion, full of goodne&s;s and wi&s;dom, firm again&s;t all the temptations to ill, that may ari&s;e from de&s;ire or fear; tending to all manner of good, thro a perfect knowledg and affection to it; and this to &s;uch a degree, that he or they have more of the&s;e vertues and excellencys than all the re&s;t of the Society, tho computed together. Where &s;uch a man is found, he is by nature a <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. l. 3.</NOTE>King, and 'tis be&s;t for the Nation where he is that he govern. If a few men, tho equal and alike among them&s;elves, have the &s;ame advantages above the re&s;t of the People, Nature for the &s;ame rea&s;on &s;eems to e&s;ta|bli&s;h an Ari&s;tocracy in that place; and the power is more &s;afely commit|ted to them, than left in the hands of the multitude. But if this excel|lency of vertue dos not appear in one, nor in a few men, the right and power is by nature equally lodg'd in all; and to a&s;&s;ume or appropriate that power to one, or a few men, is unnatural and tyrannical, which in <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s language comprehends all that is dete&s;table and abominable.</P>
<P>If any man &s;hould think <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> a trifler, for &s;peaking of &s;uch a man as can never be found, I an&s;wer, that he went as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ar as his way could be warranted by rea&s;on or nature, and was oblig'd to &s;top there by the de|fect of his Subject. He could not &s;ay that the Government o&s; one was &s;imply good, when he knew &s;o many qualifications were requir'd in the per&s;on to make it &s;o; nor that it is good for a Nation to be under the power of a &s;ool, a coward, or a villain, becau&s;e 'tis good to be under a man of admirable wi&s;dom, valor, indu&s;try and goodne&s;s; or that the Government of one &s;hould be continu'd in &s;uch as by chance &s;ucceed in a Family, becau&s;e it was given to the fir&s;t who had all the vertues requir'd,
<PB N="328" REF="336">
  tho all the rea&s;ons for which the power was given fail in the Succe&s;&s;or; much le&s;s could he &s;ay that any Government was good, which was not good for tho&s;e who&s;e good only it was con&s;tituted to promote.</P>
<P>Moreover, by &s;hewing who only is fit to be a Monarch, or may be made &s;uch, without violating the Laws of Nature and Ju&s;tice, he &s;hews who cannot be one: and he who &s;ays that no &s;uch man is to be found, as according to the opinion of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> can be a Monarch, dos mo&s;t ridiculou&s;ly alledg his Authority in favor of Monarchs, or the power which &s;ome a|mong&s;t us would attribute to them. If any thing therefore may be con|cluded from his words, 'tis this, That &s;ince no power ought to be admit|ted which is not ju&s;t; that none can be ju&s;t which is not good, profitable to the People, and conducing to the ends for which it is con&s;tituted; that no man can know how to direct the power to tho&s;e ends, can de&s;erve, or admini&s;ter it, unle&s;s he dos &s;o far excel all tho&s;e that are under him in wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice, valor and goodne&s;s, as to po&s;&s;e&s;s more of tho&s;e vertues than all of them: I &s;ay, if no &s;uch man or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of men be found, no &s;uch power is to be granted to any man, or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of men. But if &s;uch power be granted, the Laws of nature and rea&s;on are overthrown, and the ends for which Societys are con&s;tituted, utterly perverted, which nece&s;&s;arily implys an annihilation of the Grant. And if a Grant &s;o made by tho&s;e who have a right of &s;etting up a Government among&s;t them|&s;elves, do peri&s;h thro its own natural iniquity and perver&s;ity, I leave it to any man, who&s;e under&s;tanding and manners are not &s;o intirely cor|rupted as tho&s;e of our Author, to determin what name ought to be given to that per&s;on, who not excelling all others in Civil and Moral Vertues, in the proportion requir'd by <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> dos u&s;urp a power over a Nation, and what obedience the People owe to &s;uch a one.

The <HI>Roman</HI> Liberty, and that bravery of &s;pirit by which it had bin maintain'd, was not only aboli&s;h'd, but almo&s;t forgotten.

<P>TRUTH being uniform in it &s;elf, tho&s;e who de&s;ire to propagate it for the good of Mankind, lay the foundations of their rea&s;on|ings in &s;uch Principles, as are either evident to common &s;en&s;e, or ea&s;ily prov'd: but Cheats and Impo&s;tors delighting in ob&s;curity, &s;uppo&s;e things that are dubious and fal&s;e, and think to build one fal&s;hood upon another; and our Author can find no better way to per&s;uade us, that all our Privileges and Laws are from the King, than by &s;aying, <HI>That the fir&s;t Power was the Kingly Power, which was both in this and all other Nations</HI>
<PB N="330" REF="338">
  <HI>in the world, long before any Laws or any other kind of Government was thought of; from whence we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily infer, that the common Law, or common Cu&s;toms of this Land were originally the Laws and Commands of the King.</HI> But denying both the&s;e points, I affirm,</P>
<P>1. That there was a power to make Kings before there was any King.</P>
<P>2. Tho Kings had bin the fir&s;t created Magi&s;trats in all places (as per|haps they were in &s;ome it dos not follow) that they mu&s;t continue for ever, or that Laws are from them.</P>
<P>To the fir&s;t; I think no man will deny, that there was a People at <HI>Babylon,</HI> before <HI>Nimrod</HI> was King of that place. This People had a Power; for no number of men can be without it: Nay this People had a power of making <HI>Nimrod</HI> King, or he could never have bin King. He could not be King by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, for the Scripture &s;hews him to have bin the fir&s;t. He was not King by the right of Father, for he was not their Father, <HI>Chu&s;h, Cham,</HI> with his elder Brothers and Father <HI>Noah</HI> be|ing &s;till living; and, which is wor&s;t of all, were not Kings: for if they who liv'd in <HI>Nimrod</HI>'s time, or before him, neither were Kings, nor had Kings, he that ought to have bin King over all by the right of nature (if there had bin any &s;uch thing in nature) was not King. Tho&s;e who immediately &s;ucceeded him, and mu&s;t have inherited his right, if he had any, did not inherit or pretend to it: and therefore he that &s;hall now claim a right from nature as Father of a People, mu&s;t ground it upon &s;omething more certain than <HI>Noah</HI>'s right of reigning over his Children, or it can have no &s;trength in it.</P>
<P>Moreover, the Nations who in and before the time of <HI>Nimrod</HI> had no Kings, had Power, or el&s;e they could have perform'd no Act, nor con|&s;tituted any other Magi&s;trate to this day, which is ab&s;urd. There was therefore a power in Nations before there were Kings, or there could never have bin any; and <HI>Nimrod</HI> could never have bin King, if the Peo|ple of <HI>Babylon</HI> had not made him King, which they could not have done if they had not had a power of making him &s;o. 'Tis ridiculous to &s;ay he made him&s;elf King, for tho he might be &s;trong and valiant, he could not be &s;tronger than a multitude of men. That which forces mu&s;t be &s;tron|ger than that which is forc'd; and if it be true, according to the antient &s;aying, that <HI>Hercules</HI> him&s;elf is not &s;ufficient to encounter two, 'tis &s;ure more impo&s;&s;ible for one man to force a multitude, for that mu&s;t be &s;trong|er than he. If he came in by per&s;ua&s;ion, they who were per&s;uaded, were per&s;uaded to con&s;ent that he &s;hould be King. That Con&s;ent there|fore made him King. But, <HI>Qui dat e&s;&s;e, dat modum e&s;&s;e:</HI> They who made him King, made him &s;uch a King as be&s;t pleas'd them&s;elves. He had therefore nothing but what was given: his greatne&s;s and power mu&s;t be from the multitude who gave it: and their Laws and Libertys could not be from him; but their Libertys were naturally inherent in them&s;elves, and their Laws were the product of them.</P>
<P>There was a People that made <HI>Romulus</HI> King. He did not make or beget that People, nor, for any thing we know, one man of them. He could not come in by inheritance, for he was a Ba&s;tard, the Son of an un|known man; and when he dy'd, the right that had bin confer'd upon him reverted to the People, who, according to that right, cho&s;e <HI>Numa, Ho&s;tilius, Martius, Tarquinius Pri&s;cas,</HI> and <HI>Servius,</HI> all Stranges to his blood, and without any other right than what was be&s;tow'd upon them: and <HI>Tarquinius Superbus,</HI> who invaded the Throne <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sinc ju&s;&s;u populi. <BIBL>T. Liv. l. <HI>1.</HI></BIBL></NOTE><HI>without the command</HI>
<PB N="331" REF="339">
<HI>of the People,</HI> was ejected, and the Government of Kings aboli&s;h'd by   the &s;ame power that had created it.</P>
<P>We know not certainly by what Law <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and the Judges created by the advice of <HI>Jethro,</HI> govern'd the <HI>I&s;raelites;</HI> but may probably con|jecture it to have bin by that Law which God had written in the hearts of mankind; and the People &s;ubmitted to the judgment of good and wi&s;e men, tho they were under no coercive Power. But 'tis certain they had a Law and a regular Magi&s;tracy under which they liv'd, four hun|dred years before they had a King, for <HI>Saul</HI> was the fir&s;t. This Law was not therefore from the King, nor by the King; but the King was cho&s;en and made by the People, according to the liberty they had by the Law, tho they did not rightly follow the rules therein pre&s;crib'd, and by that means brought de&s;truction upon them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The Country in which we live lay long conceal'd under ob&s;cure bar|barity, and we know nothing of the fir&s;t Inhabitants, but what is in|volv'd in fables that leave us &s;till in the dark. <HI>Julius Ce&s;ar</HI> is the fir&s;t who &s;peaks di&s;tinctly of our affairs, and gives us no rea&s;on to believe there was any Monarchy then e&s;tabli&s;h'd among&s;t us. <HI>Ca&s;&s;ivellaunus</HI> was occa&s;ionally cho&s;en by the Nations that were mo&s;t expos'd to the violence <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cae&s;. Com|ment. l. 5.</NOTE>of the <HI>Romans,</HI> for the management of tho&s;e wars again&s;t them. By others we hear of <HI>Boadicia, Arviragus, Galgacus,</HI> and many more &s;et up afterwards when need requir'd; but we find no foot&s;teps of a regular Succe&s;&s;ion either by inheritance or election. And as they had then no Kings, or any other general Magi&s;trate, that can be &s;aid to be equivalent to a King, they might have had none at all unle&s;s they had thought fit. <HI>Tacitus</HI> mentions a &s;ort of Kings, us'd by the <HI>Romans</HI> to keep <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Inter in&s;trumenta &s;ervitutis reges habu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">re. <BIBL>C. Tacit.</BIBL></NOTE>Nations in &s;ervitude to them: and tho it were true that there had bin &s;uch a man as <HI>Lucius,</HI> and he one of this &s;ort, he is to be accounted only as a <HI>Roman</HI> Magi&s;trate, and &s;ignifys no more to our di&s;pute, than if he had bin call'd Procon&s;ul, Pretor, or by any other name. However there was no &s;eries of them: that which was temporary and occa&s;ional, depended upon the will of tho&s;e, who thinking there was occa&s;ion, created &s;uch a Magi|&s;trate, and omitted to do &s;o, when the occa&s;ion ceas'd, or was thought to cea&s;e; and might have had none at all, if they had &s;o pleas'd. The Magi&s;tracy therefore was from them, and depenedd upon their will.</P>
<P>We have already mention'd the Hi&s;torys of the <HI>Saxons, Danes</HI> and <HI>Normans,</HI> from which Nations, together with the <HI>Britans,</HI> we are de|&s;cended: and finding that they were &s;evere A&s;&s;ertors of their Libertys, acknowledg'd no human Laws but their own, receiv'd no Kings but &s;uch as &s;wore to ob&s;erve them, and depos'd tho&s;e who did not well perform their Oaths and Duty, 'tis evident that their Kings were made by the People according to the Law; and that the Law, by which they became what they were, could not be from them&s;elves. Our Ance&s;tors were &s;o fully convinc'd that in the creation of Kings they exercis'd their own right, and were only to con&s;ider what was good for them&s;elves, that without regard to the memory of tho&s;e who had gone before, they were accu&s;tom'd to take &s;uch as &s;eem'd mo&s;t like, wi&s;ely, ju&s;tly and gently to perform their office; refus'd tho&s;e that were &s;u&s;pected of pride, cruelty, or any other vice that might bring prejudice upon the Publick, what title &s;oever they pretended; and remov'd &s;uch as had bin plac'd in the Throne, if they did not an&s;wer the opinion conceiv'd of
<PB N="332" REF="340">
  their vertue; which I take to be a manner of proceeding that agrees better with the quality of Ma&s;ters, making Laws and Magi&s;trats for them|&s;elves, than of Slaves receiving &s;uch as were impos'd upon them.</P>
<P>2. To the &s;econd. Tho it &s;hould be granted, that all Nations had at the fir&s;t bin govern'd by Kings, it were nothing to the que&s;tion; for no man or number of Men was ever oblig'd to continue in the errors of his Predece&s;&s;ors. The Authority of Cu&s;tom as well as of Law (I mean in relation to the Power that made it to be) con&s;i&s;ts only in its rectitude: And the &s;ame rea&s;on which may have induc'd one or more Nations to create Kings, when they knew no other form of Government, may not only induce them to &s;et up another, if that be found inconvenient to them, but proves that they may as ju&s;tly do &s;o, as remove a man who performs not what was expected from him. If there had bin a Rule given by God, and written in the minds of men by nature, it mu&s;t have bin from the beginning, univer&s;al and perpetual; or at lea&s;t mu&s;t have bin ob&s;erv'd by the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t in&s;tructed Nations: which not being in any mea&s;ure (as I have prov'd already) there can be no rea&s;on, why a polite People &s;hould not relinqui&s;h the errors committed by their An|ce&s;tors in the time of their barbari&s;m and ignorance, and why they &s;hould not do it in matters of Government, as well as in any other thing relating to life. Men are &s;ubject to errors, and 'tis the work of the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t to di&s;cover and amend &s;uch as their Ance&s;tors may have committed, or to add perfection to tho&s;e things which by them have bin well invented. This is &s;o certain, that what&s;oever we enjoy beyond the mi&s;ery in which our barbarous Ance&s;tors liv'd, is due only to the liberty of correcting what was ami&s;s in their practice, or inventing that which they did not know: and I doubt whether it be more bruti&s;h to &s;ay we are oblig'd to continue in the Idolatry of the <HI>Druids,</HI> with all the mi&s;erys and follys that accompany the mo&s;t &s;avage barbarity; or to confe&s;s, that tho we have a right to depart from the&s;e, yet we are for ever bound to continue the Government they had e&s;tabli&s;h'd, whatever inconveniences might at|tend it. <HI>Tertullian</HI> di&s;puting with the <HI>Pagans,</HI> who objected the novelty of the Chri&s;tian Religion, troubled not him&s;elf with refuting that error; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nullum tempu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ulla prae&s;criptio occurrit vericuti. <BIBL>Tertul.</BIBL> Id antiquius quod verius. <BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>but proving Chri&s;tianity to be good and true, he thought he had &s;uffi|ciently prov'd it to be antient. A wi&s;e Architect may &s;hew his skill, and de&s;erve commendation for building a poor hou&s;e of vile materials, when he can procure no better; but he no way ought to hinder others from erecting more glorious Fabricks if they are furni&s;h'd with the means re|quir'd. Be&s;ides, &s;uch is the imperfection of all human Con&s;titutions, that they are &s;ubject to perpetual fluctuation, which never permits them to continue long in the &s;ame condition: Corruptions &s;lide in in&s;en&s;ibly; and the be&s;t Orders are &s;ometimes &s;ubverted by malice and violence: &s;o that he who only regards what was done in &s;uch an age, often takes the corruption of the State for the in&s;titution, follows the wor&s;t example, thinks that to be the fir&s;t that is the mo&s;t antient he knows; and if a brave People &s;eeing the original defects of their Government, or the corruption into which it may be fallen, do either correct and reform what may be amended, or aboli&s;h that which was evil in the in&s;titution, or &s;o perver|ted, that it cannot be re&s;tor'd to integrity, the&s;e men impute it to &s;edi|tion, and blame tho&s;e actions, which of all that can be perform'd by men are the mo&s;t glorious. We are not therefore &s;o much to inquire after
<PB N="333" REF="341">
that which is mo&s;t antient, as that which is be&s;t, and mo&s;t conducing to   the good ends to which it was directed. As Governments were in&s;tituted for the obtaining of Ju&s;tice, and (as our Author &s;ays) the pre&s;ervation of Liberty, we are not to &s;eek what Government was the fir&s;t, but what be&s;t provides for the obtaining of Ju&s;tice, and the pre&s;ervation of Liber|ty. For what&s;oever the In&s;titution be, and how long &s;oever it may have la&s;ted, 'tis void, if it thwarts, or dos not provide for the end of its e&s;ta|bli&s;hment. If &s;uch a Law or Cu&s;tom therefore as is not good in it &s;elf, had in the beginning prevail'd in all parts of the world (which in rela|tion to ab&s;olute or any kind of Monarchy is not true) it ought to be abo|li&s;h'd; and if any man &s;hould &s;hew him&s;elf wi&s;er than others by pro|po&s;ing a Law or Government, more beneficial to mankind than any that had bin formerly known, providing better for Ju&s;tice and Liberty than all others had done, he would merit the highe&s;t veneration. If any man ask, who &s;hall be Judg of that rectitude or pravity which either autho|ri&s;es or de&s;troys a Law? I an&s;wer, that as this con&s;i&s;ts not in formalitys and nicetys, but in evident and &s;ub&s;tantial truths, there is no need of any other Tribunal than that of common &s;en&s;e, and the light of nature, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o determin the matter: and he that travels thro <HI>France, Italy, Turky, Germany</HI> and <HI>Switzerland,</HI> without con&s;ulting <HI>Bartolus</HI> or <HI>Baldus,</HI> will ea&s;ily under&s;tand whether the Countrys that are under the Kings of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> the Pope and the Great <HI>Turk,</HI> or &s;uch as are under the care of a well-regulated Magi&s;tracy, do be&s;t enjoy the benefits of Ju&s;tice and Liberty. 'Tis as ea&s;ily determin'd whether the <HI>Grecians</HI> when <HI>Athens</HI> and <HI>Thebes</HI> flouri&s;h'd were more free than the <HI>Medes;</HI> whether Ju&s;tice was better admini&s;ter'd by <HI>Agathocles, Diony&s;ius</HI> and <HI>Phalaris,</HI> than by the legal Kings and regular Magi&s;trats of <HI>Sparta;</HI> or whether more care was taken that Ju&s;tice and Liberty might be pre&s;erv'd by <HI>Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero</HI> and <HI>Vitellius,</HI> than by the Senat and People of <HI>Rome</HI> whil&s;t the Laws were more powerful than the commands of men. The like may be &s;aid of particular Laws, as tho&s;e of <HI>Nabuchodono&s;or</HI> and <HI>Caligula,</HI> for wor&s;hipping their Statues; our Acts of Parliament again&s;t Hereticks and Lollards, with the Statutes and Orders of the Inqui&s;ition which is call'd the Holy Office. And if that only be a Law which is <HI>Sanctio recta, jubens hone&s;ta, prohibens contraria,</HI> the meane&s;t under&s;tand|ing, if free from pa&s;&s;ion, may certainly know that &s;uch as the&s;e cannot be Laws, by what Authority &s;oever they were enacted; and that the u&s;e of them, and others like to them, ought to be aboli&s;h'd for their turpi|tude and iniquity. Infinite examples of the like nature might be alledg'd, as well concerning divine as human things. And if there be any Laws which are evil, there cannot be an inconte&s;table rectitude in all; and if not in all, it concerns us to examin where it is to be found. Laws and Con&s;titutions ought to be weigh'd; and whil&s;t all due reverence is paid to &s;uch as are good, every Nation may not only retain in it &s;elf a power of changing or aboli&s;hing all &s;uch as are not &s;o, but ought to exerci&s;e that Power according to the be&s;t of their under&s;tanding; and in the place of what was either at fir&s;t mi&s;taken, or afterwards corrupted, to con&s;titute that which is mo&s;t conducing to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Ju&s;tice and Liberty.</P>
<P>But &s;uch is the condition of mankind, that nothing can be &s;o perfectly fram'd as not to give &s;ome te&s;timony of human imbecillity, and frequent|ly to &s;tand in need of reparations and amendments. Many things are unknown to the wi&s;e&s;t, and the be&s;t men can never wholly deve&s;t them|&s;elves of pa&s;&s;ions and affections. By this means the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t are
<PB N="334" REF="342">
  &s;ometimes led into Error, and &s;tand in need of Succe&s;&s;ors like to them&s;elves, who may find remedys for the faults they have committed; and nothing can or ought to be permanent but that which is perfect. No natural body was ever &s;o well temper'd and organiz'd, as not to be &s;ubject to di&s;ea&s;es, wounds or other accidents, and to need medicins and other occa|&s;ional helps as well as nouri&s;hment and exerci&s;e: and he who under the name of Innovation would deprive Nations of the like, dos, as much as lies in him, condemn them all to peri&s;h by the defects of their own foun|dations. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;cor&s;. di Macchiav. l. 2.</NOTE>Some men ob&s;erving this, have propos'd a nece&s;&s;ity of reducing every State once in an age or two, to the integrity of its fir&s;t principle: but they ought to have examin'd, whether that principle be good or evil, or &s;o good that nothing can be added to it, which none ever was; and this being &s;o, tho&s;e who would admit of no change would render Errors perpetual, and depriving Mankind of the benefits of Wi&s;dom, Indu&s;try, Experience, and the right u&s;e of Rea&s;on, oblige all to continue in the mi&s;erable barbarity of their Ance&s;tors, which &s;utes better with the nature of a Wolf than that of a Man.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are of better under&s;tanding, weigh all things, and often find rea&s;on to abrogate that which their fathers, according to the mea&s;ure of the knowledg they had, or the &s;tate of things among them, had rightly in&s;tituted, or to re&s;tore that which they had abrogated; and there can be no greater mark of a mo&s;t bruti&s;h &s;tupidity, than for men to continue in an evil way, becau&s;e their fathers had brought them into it. But if we ought not too &s;trictly to adhere to our own Con&s;titutions, tho&s;e of other Nations are le&s;s to be regarded by us; for the Laws that may be good for one People are not for all, and that which agrees with the manners of one Age, is utterly abhorrent from tho&s;e of another. It were ab&s;urd to think of re&s;toring the Laws of <HI>Lycurgus</HI> to the pre&s;ent inhabitants of <HI>Peloponne&s;us,</HI> who are accu&s;tom'd to the mo&s;t abject &s;lavery. It may ea&s;ily be imagin'd, how the <HI>Romans, Sabins</HI> and <HI>Latins,</HI> now under the tyran|ny of the Pope, would reli&s;h &s;uch a di&s;ciplin as flouri&s;h'd among them after the expul&s;ion of the <HI>Tarquins;</HI> and it had bin no le&s;s prepo&s;terous to give a liberty to the <HI>Parthians</HI> of governing them&s;elves, or for them to a&s;&s;ume it, than to impo&s;e an ab&s;olute Monarch upon the <HI>German</HI> Na|tion. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;t. l. 2.</NOTE><HI>Titus Livius</HI> having ob&s;erv'd this, &s;ays, that if a popular Govern|ment had bin &s;et up in <HI>Rome</HI> immediately upon the building of the City; and if that fierce people, which was compos'd of unruly &s;hepherds, herd&s;|men, fugitive &s;laves, and out law'd per&s;ons, who could not &s;uffer the Government under which they wereborn, had come to be incited by tur|bulent Orators, they would have brought all into confu&s;ion: whereas that boi&s;terous humor being gradually temper'd by di&s;ciplin under <HI>Romu|lus,</HI> or taught to vent its fury again&s;t foreign enemys, and &s;often'd by the peaceable reign of <HI>Numa,</HI> a new Race grew up, which being all of one blood, contracted a love to their Country, and became capable of Liber|ty, which the madne&s;s of their la&s;t King, and the leudne&s;s of his Son, gave them occa&s;ion to re&s;ume. If this was commendable in them, it mu&s;t be &s;o in other Nations. If the <HI>Germans</HI> might pre&s;erve their Liber|ty, as well as the <HI>Parthians</HI> &s;ubmit them&s;elves to ab&s;olute Monarchy; 'tis as lawful for the de&s;cendents of tho&s;e <HI>Germans</HI> to continue in it, as for the Ea&s;tern Nations to be &s;laves. If one Nation may ju&s;tly chu&s;e the Government that &s;eems be&s;t to them, and continue or alter it according to the changes of times and things, the &s;ame right mu&s;t belong to others. The great variety of Laws that are or have bin in the world, proceeds
<PB N="335" REF="343">
from this; and nothing can better &s;hew the wi&s;dom and vertue, or the   vices and folly of Nations, than the u&s;e they make of this right: they have bin glorious or infamous, powerful or de&s;picable, happy or mi&s;era|ble, as they have well or ill executed it.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid that the Law given by God to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> proceed|ing from his wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, mu&s;t needs be perfect and obliga|tory to all Nations: I an&s;wer, that there is a &s;imple and a relative perfection; the fir&s;t is only in God, the other in the things he has cre|ated. <HI>He &s;aw that they were good;</HI> which can &s;ignify no more than that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 1.</NOTE>they were good in their kind, and &s;uted to the end for which he de&s;ign'd them. For if the perfection were ab&s;olute, there could be no difference between an Angel and a Worm; and nothing could be &s;ubject to change or death, for that is imperfection. This relative perfection is &s;een al&s;o by his Law given to mankind in the per&s;ons of <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Noah.</HI> It was good in the kind, fit for tho&s;e times, but could never have bin enlarg'd or alter'd, if the perfection had bin &s;imple; and no better evidence can be given to &s;hew that it was not &s;o, than that God did afterwards give one much more full and expli|cit to his People. This Law al&s;o was peculiarly applicable to that People and Sea&s;on; for if it had bin otherwi&s;e, the Apo&s;tles would have oblig'd Chri&s;tians to the intire ob&s;ervation of it, as well as to ab&s;tain from idolatry, fornication and blood. But if all this be not &s;o, then their judicial Law, and the form of their Commonwealth mu&s;t be receiv'd by all; no human Law can be of any value; we are all Brethren, no man has a prerogative above another; Lands mu&s;t be equally divided among&s;t all; Inheritances cannot be alienated for above fifty years; no man can be rais'd above the re&s;t unle&s;s he be call'd by God, and enabled by his Spirit to conduct the People: When this man dies, he that has the &s;ame Spirit mu&s;t &s;ucceed, as <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> did to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and his Children can have no title to his Office: when &s;uch a man appears, a <HI>Sanhedrim</HI> of &s;eventy men cho&s;en out of the whole People, are to judg &s;uch cau&s;es as relate to them&s;elves, whil&s;t tho&s;e of greater extent and importance are refer'd to the General A&s;&s;em|blys. Here is no mention of a King, and con&s;equently, if we mu&s;t take this Law for our pattern, we cannot have one: If the point be driven to the utmo&s;t, and the precept of <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> where God permitted them to have a King, if they thought fit, when they came into the promis'd Land, be under&s;tood to extend to all Nations, every one of them mu&s;t have the &s;ame liberty of taking their own time, chu&s;ing him in their own way, dividing the Kingdom, having no King, and &s;etting up other Governors when they plea&s;e, as before the E|lection of <HI>Saul,</HI> and after the return from the Captivity: and even when they have a King, he mu&s;t be &s;uch a one as is de&s;crib'd in the &s;ame Chapter, who no more re&s;embles the Sovereign Maje&s;ty that our Author adores, and agrees as little with his Maxims, as a Tribun of the Roman People.</P>
<P>We may therefore conclude, that if we are to follow the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> we mu&s;t take it with all the appendages; a King can be no more, and no otherwi&s;e than he makes him: for whatever we read of the Kings they had, were extreme deviations from it. No Nation can make any Law, and our Lawyers burning their Books may betake them&s;elves to the &s;tudy of the Pentateuch, in which tho &s;ome of them may be well vers'd, yet probably the profit ari&s;ing from thence will not be very great.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="344">
  But if we are not oblig'd to live in a conformity to the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> every People may frame Laws for them&s;elves, and we cannot be deny'd the right that is common to all. Our Laws were not &s;ent from Heaven, but made by our Ance&s;tors according to the light they had, and their pre&s;ent occa&s;ions. We inherit the &s;ame right from them; and, as we may without vanity &s;ay that we know a little more than they did, if we find our &s;elves prejudic'd by any Law that they made, we may repeal it. The &s;afety of the People was their &s;upreme Law, and is &s;o to us: neither can we be thought le&s;s fit to judg what conduces to that end, than they were. If they in any Age had bin per&s;uaded to put them|&s;elves under the power, or, in our Author's phra&s;e, under the &s;overeign Maje&s;ty of a child, a fool, a mad or de&s;perately wicked per&s;on, and had annex'd the right confer'd upon him to &s;uch as &s;hould &s;ucceed, it had not bin a <HI>ju&s;t and right Sanction;</HI> and having none of the qualitys e&s;&s;en|tially belonging to a Law, could not have the effect of a Law. It can|not be for the good of a People to be govern'd by one, who by nature ought to be govern'd, or by age or accident is render'd unable to govern him&s;elf. The publick intere&s;ts, and the concernments of private men in their lands, goods, libertys and lives (for the pre&s;ervation of which, our Author &s;ays, the regal Prerogative is only con&s;tituted) cannot be pre&s;erv'd by one who is tran&s;ported by his own pa&s;&s;ions or follys, a &s;lave to his lu&s;ts and vices; or, which is &s;ometimes wor&s;e, govern'd by the vile&s;t of men and women who flatter him in them, and pu&s;h him on to do &s;uch things as even they would abhor, if they were in his place. The turpitude and impious madne&s;s of &s;uch an act mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily make it void, by overthrowing the ends for which it was made, &s;ince that ju&s;tice which was &s;ought cannot be obtain'd, nor the evils that were fear'd prevented; and they for who&s;e good it was intended, mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily have a right of aboli&s;hing it. This might be &s;ufficient for us, tho our Ance&s;tors had en&s;lav'd them&s;elves. But, God be thank'd, we are not put to that trouble: We have no rea&s;on to believe we are de|&s;cended from &s;uch fools and bea&s;ts, as would willingly ca&s;t them&s;elves and us into &s;uch an exce&s;s of mi&s;ery and &s;hame, or that they were &s;o tame and cowardly to be &s;ubjected by force or fear. We know the value they &s;et upon their Libertys, and the courage with which they de|fended them: and we can have no better example to incourage us, never to &s;uffer them to be violated or dimini&s;h'd.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXVI. Tho the King may be entru&s;ted with the power of chu&s;ing Judges, yet that by which they act is from the Law.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I Confe&s;s that no Law can be &s;o perfect,</HI> to provide exactly for every ca&s;e that may fall out, &s;o as to leave nothing to the di&s;cretion of the Judges, <HI>who in &s;ome mea&s;ure are to interpret them: But</HI> that Laws or Cu&s;toms are ever few, or that the paucity is the rea&s;on that they cannot give &s;pecial rules, or that Judges do re&s;ort to tho&s;e Principles or Common Law Axioms, whereupon former Judgments in ca&s;es &s;omething alike have bin
<PB N="337" REF="345">
given by former Judges, who all receive their Authority from the King in   his right to give Sentence, <HI>I utterly deny; and affirm,</HI></P>
<P>1. That in many places, and particularly in <HI>England,</HI> the Laws are &s;o many, that the number of them has introduc'd an uncertainty and confu&s;ion, which is both dangerous and trouble&s;om; and the infinite variety of adjudg'd ca&s;es thwarting and contradicting each other, has render'd the&s;e difficultys inextricable. <HI>Tacitus</HI> imputes a great part of the mi&s;erys &s;uffer'd by the <HI>Romans</HI> in his time to this abu&s;e, and tells us, that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Et in corrupti&s;&s;ima Republica plurimae Leges.</NOTE><HI>the Laws grew to be innumerable in the wor&s;t and mo&s;t corrupt &s;tate of things,</HI> and that Ju&s;tice was overthrown by them. By the &s;ame means in <HI>France, Italy,</HI> and other places, where the Civil Law is render'd municipal, Judgments are in a manner arbitrary; and tho the intention of our Laws be ju&s;t and good, they are &s;o numerous, and the volumes of our Statutes with the Interpretations and adjudg'd Ca&s;es &s;o va&s;t, that hardly any thing is &s;o clear and fix'd, but men of wit and learning may find what will &s;erve for a pretence to ju&s;tify almo&s;t any judgment they have a mind to give. Whereas the Laws of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> as to the Judicial part, being &s;hort and few, Judgments were ea&s;y and certain; and in <HI>Switzerland, Sweden,</HI> and &s;ome parts of <HI>Denmark,</HI> the whole Volume that contains them may be read in few hours, and by that means no inju&s;tice can be done which is not immediately made evident.</P>
<P>2. Axioms are not rightly grounded upon judg'd Ca&s;es, but Ca&s;es are to be judg'd according to Axioms: the certain is not prov'd by the uncertain, but the uncertain by the certain; and every thing is to be e&s;teem'd uncertain till it be prov'd to be certain. Axioms in Law are, as in Mathematicks, evident to common &s;en&s;e; and nothing is to be taken for an Axiom, that is not &s;o. <HI>Euclid</HI> dos not prove his Axioms by his Propo&s;itions, but his Propo&s;itions, which are ab&s;tru&s;e, by &s;uch Ax|ioms as are evident to all. The Axioms of our Law do not receive their Authority from <HI>Coke</HI> and <HI>Hales,</HI> but <HI>Coke</HI> and <HI>Hales</HI> de&s;erve prai&s;e for giving judgment according to &s;uch as are undeniably true.</P>
<P>3. The Judges reeeive their Commi&s;&s;ions from the King; and per|haps it may be &s;aid, that the Cu&s;tom of naming them is grounded upon a right with which he is entru&s;ted; but their power is from the Law, as that of the King al&s;o is. For he who has none originally in him&s;elf, can give none unle&s;s it be fir&s;t confer'd upon him. I know not how he can well perform his Oath to govern according to Law, unle&s;s he execute the power with which he is entru&s;ted, in naming tho&s;e men to be Judges, whom in his con&s;cience, and by the advice of his Council, he thinks the be&s;t and able&s;t to perform that Office: But both he and they are to learn their duty from that Law, by which they are, and which allots to every one his proper work. As the Law intends that men &s;hould be made Judges for their integrity and knowledg in the Law, and that it ought not to be imagin'd that the King will break his tru&s;t by chu&s;ing &s;uch as are not &s;o, till the violation be evident, nothing is more rea&s;onable than to intend that the Judges &s;o qualify'd &s;hould in&s;truct the King in matters of Law. But that he who may be a child, over-ag'd, or otherwi&s;e ignorant and uncapable, &s;hould in&s;truct the Judges, is equally ab&s;urd, as for a blind man to be a guide to tho&s;e who have the be&s;t eyes; and &s;o abhorrent from the meaning of the Law, that the Judges (as I &s;aid be|fore)
<PB N="338" REF="346">
  are &s;worn to do ju&s;tice according to the Laws, without any regard to the King's words, letters or commands. If they are therefore to act according to a &s;et rule, from which they may not depart what command &s;oever they receive, they do not act by a power from him, but by one that is above both. This is commonly confe&s;t; and tho &s;ome Judges have bin found in &s;everal ages, who in hopes of reward and preferment have made little account of their Oath, yet the &s;ucce&s;s that many of them have had, may rea&s;onably deter others from following their example: and if there are not more in&s;tances in this kind, no better rea&s;on can be given, than that <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Jure igitur plectimur; ni&s;i enim multorum impunita feeler<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> tuli&s;&s;emus, nunquam ad unum tanta perveni&s;&s;et licentia. <BIBL>Cicero.</BIBL></NOTE>Nations do frequently fail, by being too remi&s;s in a&s;&s;erting their own rights or puni&s;hing offenders, and hardly ever err on the &s;everer &s;ide.</P>

In <HI>England</HI> the Kings do not judg, but are judg'd: and <HI>Bracton</HI> &s;ays, <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">In ju&s;titia recipienda rex cuilibet ex plebe aqualis e&s;t.</NOTE><HI>That in receiving ju&s;tice the King is equal to another man;</HI> which could not be, if judgments were given by him, and he were exempted from the judgment of all by that Law, which has put all judgments into the hands of the People. This power is executed by them in grand or petty Jurys, and the Judges are a&s;&s;i&s;tants to them in explaining the difficult points of the Law, in which 'tis pre|&s;um'd they &s;hould be learned. The &s;trength of every judgment con&s;i&s;ts in the verdict of the&s;e Jurys, which the Judges do not give, but pro|nounce or declare: and the &s;ame Law that makes good a verdict given contrary to the advice or direction of the Judges, expo&s;es them to the utmo&s;t penaltys, if upon their own heads, or a command from the King, they &s;hould pre&s;ume to give a Sentence, without or contrary to a Ver|dict; and no preten&s;ions to a power of interpreting the Law can exempt them if they break it. The power al&s;o with which the Judges are en|tru&s;ted, is but of a moderate extent, and to be executed <HI>bona &s;ide.</HI> Preva|rications are capital, as they prov'd to <HI>Tre&s;ilian, Emp&s;on, Dudley,</HI> and many others. Nay even in &s;pecial Verdicts, the Judges are only a&s;&s;i&s;t|ants to the Jurys who find it &s;pecially, and the Verdict is from them; tho the Judges having heard the point argu'd, declare the &s;en&s;e of the Law thereupon. Wherefore if I &s;hould grant that the King might per&s;onally a&s;&s;i&s;t in judgments, his work could only be to prevent frauds, and by the advice of the Judges to &s;ee that the Laws be duly executed, or perhaps to in&s;pect their behaviour. If he has more than this, it mu&s;t be by vir|tue of his politick capacity, in which he is under&s;tood to be always pre|&s;ent in the principal Courts, where Ju&s;tice is always done whether he who wears the Crown be young or old, wi&s;e or ignorant, good or bad, or whether he like or di&s;like what is done.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="347">
Moreover, as Governments are in&s;tituted for the obtaining of Ju&s;tice,   and the King is in a great mea&s;ure entru&s;ted with the power of executing it, 'tis probable that the Law would have requir'd his pre&s;ence in the di&s;tribution, if there had bin but one Court; that at the &s;ame time he could be pre&s;ent in more than one; that it were certain he would be guilty of no mi&s;carriages; that all mi&s;carriages were to be puni&s;h'd in him as well as in the Judges; or that it were certain he &s;hould always be a man of &s;uch wi&s;dom, indu&s;try, experience and integrity, as to be an a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance to, and a watch over tho&s;e who are appointed for the admini&s;tra|tion of Ju&s;tice. But there being many Courts &s;itting at the &s;ame time of equal Authority, in &s;everal places far di&s;tant from each other; it being impo&s;&s;ible for the King to be pre&s;ent in all; there being no manner of a&s;&s;urance that the &s;ame or greater mi&s;carriages may not be committed in his pre&s;ence than in his ab&s;ence, by him&s;elf than others; no opportunity of puni&s;hing every delict in him, without bringing the Nation into &s;uch di&s;order, as may be of more prejudice to the publick than an injury done to a private man; the Law which intends to obviate offences, or to pu|ni&s;h &s;uch as cannot be obviated, has directed, that tho&s;e men &s;hould be cho&s;en who are mo&s;t knowing in it, impo&s;es an Oath upon them, not to be diverted from the due cour&s;e of ju&s;tice by fear or favor, hopes or re|ward, particularly by any command from the King; and appoints the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hments for them if they prove fal&s;e to God and their Country.</P>
<P>If any man think that the words cited from <HI>Bracton</HI> by our Author upon the que&s;tion, <HI>Quis primo &amp; principaliter po&s;&s;it &amp; debeat judicare, &amp;c. Sciendum e&s;t quod Rex &amp; non alius, &s;i &s;olus ad haec &s;ufficere po&s;&s;it; cum ad hoc per virtutem Sacramenti teneatur,</HI> are contrary to what I have &s;aid, I de&s;ire the context may be con&s;ider'd, that his opinion may be truly un|der&s;tood, tho the words taken &s;imply and nakedly may be enough for my purpo&s;e. For 'tis ridiculous to infer that the King has a right of doing any thing, upon a &s;uppo&s;ition that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for him to do it. He therefore who &s;ays the King cannot do it, &s;ays it mu&s;t be done by others, or not at all. But having already prov'd that the King, merely as King, has none of the qualitys requir'd for judging all or any ca&s;es, and that many Kings have all the defects of age and per&s;on that render men mo&s;t unable and unfit to give any Sentence; we may conclude, without con|tradicting <HI>Bracton,</HI> that no King as King has a power of judging, be|cau&s;e &s;ome of them are utterly unable and unfit to do it; and if any one has &s;uch a power, it mu&s;t be confer'd upon him by tho&s;e who think him able and fit to perform that work. When <HI>Filmer</HI> finds &s;uch a man, we mu&s;t inquire into the extent of that power which is given to him; but this would be nothing to his general propo&s;ition, for he him&s;elf would hardly have infer'd, that becau&s;e a power of judging in &s;ome ca&s;es was confer'd upon one Prince on account of his fitne&s;s and ability, therefore all of 'em, however unfit and unable, have a power of deciding all ca&s;es. Be&s;ides, if he believe <HI>Bracton,</HI> this power of judging is not inherent in the King, but incumbent upon him by virtue of his Oath, which our Author endeavours to enervate and annul. But as that Oath is grounded upon the Law, and the Law cannot pre&s;ume impo&s;&s;ibilitys and ab&s;urditys, it cannot intend, and the Oath cannot require, that a man &s;hould do that which he is unable and unfit to do. Many Kings are unfit to judg cau&s;es, the Law cannot therefore intend they &s;hould do it. The Context al&s;o &s;hews, that this imagination of the King's judging all cau&s;es, if he
<PB N="340" REF="348">
  could, is merely chimerical: for <HI>Bracton</HI> &s;ays in the &s;ame Chapter, that <HI>the power of the King is the Power of the Law;</HI> that is, that he has no power but by the Law. And the Law that aims at ju&s;tice, cannot make it to depend upon the uncertain humor of a Child, a Woman, or a fooli&s;h Man; for by that means it would de&s;troy it &s;elf. The Law can|not therefore give any &s;uch power, and the King cannot have it.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid that all Kings are not &s;o; that &s;ome are of mature age, wi&s;e, ju&s;t and good; or that the que&s;tion is not what is good for the Subject, but what is glorious to the King, and that he mu&s;t not lo&s;e his right tho the People peri&s;h; I an&s;wer, fir&s;t, that what&s;oever belongs to Kings as Kings, belongs to all Kings: this Power of judging cannot be|long to all for the Rea&s;ons above-mention'd: it cannot therefore belong to any as King, nor without madne&s;s be granted to any, till he has given te&s;timony of &s;uch Wi&s;dom, Experience, Diligence and Goodne&s;s, as is requir'd for &s;o great a work. It imports not what his Ance&s;tors were; Vertues are not entail'd; and it were le&s;s improper for the Heirs of <HI>Hales</HI> and <HI>Harvey,</HI> to pretend that the Clients and Patients of their Ance&s;tors &s;hould depend upon their advice in matters of Law and Phy&s;ick, than for the Heirs of a great and wi&s;e Prince to pretend to Powers given on account of vertue, if they have not the &s;ame talents for the performance of the works requir'd.</P>
<P>Common &s;en&s;e declares, that Governments are in&s;tituted, and Judica|tures erected for the obtaining of ju&s;tice. The Kings Bench was not e&s;tabli&s;h'd that the Chief Ju&s;tice &s;hould have a great Office, but that the oppre&s;&s;ed &s;hould be reliev'd, and right done. The Honor and Profit he receives, comes in as it were by accident, as the rewards of his &s;ervice, if he rightly perform his duty: but he may as well pretend he is there for his own &s;ake, as the King. God did not &s;et up <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> or <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> that they might glory in having &s;ix hundred thou&s;and men under their command, but that they might lead the People into the Land they were to po&s;&s;e&s;s: that is, they were not for them&s;elves, but for the People; and the glory they acquir'd was by rightly performing the end of their in&s;titution. Even our Author is oblig'd to confe&s;s this, when he &s;ays, that the King's Prerogative is in&s;tituted for the good of tho&s;e that are un|der it. 'Tis therefore for them that he enjoys it, and it can no otherwi&s;e &s;ub&s;i&s;t than in concurrence with that end. He al&s;o yields that <HI>the &s;afety of the People is the &s;upreme Law.</HI> The right therefore that the King has mu&s;t be conformable and &s;ubordinate to it. If any one therefore &s;et up an intere&s;t in him&s;elf that is not &s;o, he breaks this &s;upreme Law; he dos not live and reign for his People but for him&s;elf, and by departing from the end of his in&s;titution de&s;troys it: and if <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> (to whom our Au|thor &s;eems to have a great deference) de&s;erves credit, &s;uch a one cea&s;es to be a King, and becomes a Tyrant; he who ought to have bin the be&s;t of men is turn'd into the wor&s;t; and he who is recommended to us under the name of a Father, becomes a publick Enemy to the People. The que&s;tion therefore is not, what is good for the King, but what is good for the People, and he can have no right repugnant to them.</P>
<P><HI>Bracton</HI> is not more gentle. <HI>The King,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>is oblig'd by his Oath, to the utmo&s;t of his power, to pre&s;erve the Church, and the Chri&s;tian World in peace; to hinder rapine, and all manner of iniquity; to cau&s;e ju&s;tice and mercy to be ob&s;erv'd: He has no power but from the Law: that only is to be taken for Law, quod recte fuerit definitum:</HI> he is therefore to cau&s;e ju&s;tice to be done according to that rule, and not to pervert it for his own plea|&s;ure,

<P>Tho <HI>&V;lpian</HI>'s words, <HI>Princeps legibus non tenetur,</HI> be granted to have bin true in fact, with relation to the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, in the time when he liv'd; yet they can conclude nothing again&s;t us.

Every Na|tion is to take care of their own Laws; and whether any one has had the Wi&s;dom, Vertue, Fortune and Power to defend them or not, concerns only them&s;elves. The Examples of great and good men acting freely de&s;erve con&s;ideration, but they only peri&s;h by the ill &s;ucce&s;s of their de|&s;igns; and what&s;oever is afterwards done by their &s;ubdu'd Po&s;terity ought to have no other effect upon the re&s;t of the world, than to admoni&s;h them &s;o to join in the defence of their Libertys, as never to be brought under the nece&s;&s;ity of acting by the command of one, to the prejudice of them&s;elves and their Country. If the <HI>Roman</HI> greatne&s;s per&s;uade us to put an extraordinary value upon what pa&s;s'd among them, we ought rather to examin what they did, &s;aid, or thought when they enjoy'd that Liberty which was the Mother and Nur&s;e of their Vertue, than what they &s;uffer'd, or were forc'd to &s;ay, when fallen under that Slavery which produc'd all manner of corruption, and made them the mo&s;t ba&s;e and mi&s;erable People of the world.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="350">
  For what concerns us, the Actions of our Ance&s;tors re&s;emble tho&s;e of the antient rather than the later <HI>Romans:</HI> tho our Government be not the &s;ame with theirs in form, yet it is in principle; and if we are not de|generated, we &s;hall rather de&s;ire to imitate the <HI>Romans</HI> in the time of their vertue, glory, power and felicity, than what they were in that of their &s;lavery, vice, &s;hame and mi&s;ery. In the be&s;t times, when <HI>the Laws were more powerful than the commands of men,</HI> fraud was accounted a crime &s;o dete&s;table as not to be imputed to any but Slaves; and he who had &s;ought a power above the Law under color of interpreting it, would have bin expos'd to &s;corn, or greater puni&s;hments, if any can be greater than the ju&s;t &s;corn of the be&s;t men. And as neither the <HI>Romans,</HI> nor any people of the world, have better defended their libertys than the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation when any attempt has bin made to oppre&s;s them by force, they ought to be no le&s;s careful to pre&s;erve them from the more dangerous efforts of fraud and fal&s;hood.</P>
<P>Our Ance&s;tors were certainly in a low condition in the time of <HI>William</HI> the Fir&s;t: Many of their be&s;t men had peri&s;h'd in the Civil Wars or with <HI>Harold:</HI> their valor was great, but rough, and void of skill: The <HI>Nor|mans</HI> by frequent Expeditions into <HI>France, Italy</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> had added &s;ub|tilty to the boi&s;terous violence of their native climate: <HI>William</HI> had en|gag'd his Faith, but broke it, and turn'd the power with which he was entru&s;ted to the ruin of tho&s;e that had tru&s;ted him. He de&s;troy'd many worthy men, carry'd others into <HI>Normandy,</HI> and thought him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of all. He was crafty, bold, and elated with Victory; but the re&s;olu|tion of a brave People was invincible. When their Laws and Libertys were in danger, they re&s;olved to die or to defend them, and made him &s;ee he could no otherwi&s;e pre&s;erve his Crown and Life than by the per|formance of his Oath, and accompli&s;hing the ends of his Election. They neither took him to be the giver or interpreter of their Laws, and would not &s;uffer him to violate tho&s;e of their Ance&s;tors. In this way they always continu'd; and tho perhaps they might want skill to fall upon the &s;ure&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t means of re&s;training the lu&s;ts of Princes, yet they main|tain'd their rights &s;o well, that the wi&s;e&s;t Princes &s;eldom invaded them; and the &s;ucce&s;s of tho&s;e who were &s;o fooli&s;h to attempt it was &s;uch, as may ju&s;tly deter others from following their unpro&s;perous Examples. We have had no King &s;ince <HI>William</HI> the Fir&s;t more hardy than <HI>Henry</HI> the 8<HI>th,</HI> and yet he &s;o intirely acknowledg'd the power of making, changing and repealing Laws to be in the Parliament, as never to attempt any extraor|dinary thing otherwi&s;e than by their Authority. It was not he, but the Parliament, that di&s;&s;olv'd the Abbys: He did not take their Lands to him|&s;elf, but receiv'd what the Parliament thought fit to give him: He did not reject the Supremacy of the Pope, nor a&s;&s;ume any other power in &s;pi|ritual matters, than the Parliament confer'd upon him. The intricacys of his Marriages, and the legitimation of his Children were &s;ettled by the &s;ame Power: At lea&s;t one of his Daughters could not inherit the Crown upon any other Title; they who gave him a power to di&s;po&s;e of the Crown by will, might have given it to his Groom; and he was too haughty to ask it from them, if he had it in him&s;elf, which he mu&s;t have had, if the Laws and Judicatures had bin in his hand.</P>
<P>This is farther evidenc'd by what pa&s;s'd in the Tower between Sir <HI>Tho|mas Moor</HI> and <HI>Rich</HI> the King's Sollicitor, who asking, If it would not be <NOTE PLACE="marg">Herberts<HI>'s</HI> Hen. 8<HI>th.</HI></NOTE>trea&s;on to oppo&s;e <HI>Richard Rich,</HI> if the Parliament &s;hould make him King, <HI>Moor</HI> &s;aid that was <HI>Ca&s;us levis;</HI> for the Parliament could make and depo&s;e

This may be enough to prove that the King cannot have a power over the Law; and if he has it not, the power of interpreting Law is ab&s;urdly attributed to him, &s;ince it is founded upon a &s;uppo&s;ition that he can make them, which is fal&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXVII. <HI>Magna Charta</HI> was not the Original, but a Declaration of the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Libertys. The King's Power is not re&s;train'd, but created by that and other Laws; and the Nation that made them can only cor|rect the defects of them.</HEAD>
<P>I Agree with our Author that <HI>Magna Charta was not made to re&s;train the ab&s;olute Authority;</HI> for no &s;uch thing was in being or pretended (the folly of &s;uch vi&s;ions &s;eeming to have bin re&s;erv'd to compleat the misfortune and ignominy of our age) but it was to a&s;&s;ert the native and original Libertys of our Nation by the confe&s;&s;ion of the King then be|ing, that neither he nor his Succe&s;&s;ors &s;hould any way encroach upon them: and it cannot be &s;aid that the power of Kings is dimini&s;h'd by that or any other Law; for as they are Kings only by Law, the Law may confer power upon one in particular, or upon him and his Succe&s;&s;ors, but can take nothing from them, becau&s;e they have nothing except what is given to them. But as that which the Law gives, is given by tho&s;e who make the Law, they only are capable of judging, whether he to whom they gave it, do well or ill imploy that power, and con&s;equently are only fit to correct the defects that may be found in it. Therefore tho I &s;hould confe&s;s that faults may be found in many Statutes, and that the whole bo|dy of them is greatly defective, it will not follow that the compendious way of referring all to the will of the King &s;hould be taken. But what defects &s;oever may be in our Law, the di&s;ea&s;e is not &s;o great to re|quire extreme remedys, and we may hope for a cheaper cure. Our Law may po&s;&s;ibly have given away too much from the People, and provided only in&s;ufficient defences of our Libertys again&s;t the incroachments of bad Princes; but none who are not in judgment and hone&s;ty like to our Au|thor, can propo&s;e for a remedy to the evils that proceed from the error of giving too much, the re&s;ignation of all the re&s;t to them. And whatever he &s;ays, 'tis evident that he knows this to be true, tho when he denys that the power of King can be re&s;train'd by Acts of Parliament, he endeavours to take advantage of &s;uch clau&s;es as were either fraudulently in&s;erted by the King's Officers, who till the days of <HI>Henry</HI> the Fifth for the mo&s;t part had the penning of the publick Acts, or thro negligence did not fully ex|plain the intentions of the Legi&s;lators; which would be to no purpo&s;e if all were put into the hands of the King by a general Law from God, that
<PB N="344" REF="352">
  no human power could dimini&s;h or enlarge; and as his la&s;t &s;hift would obliquely put all into the power of the King, by giving him a right of inter|preting the Law, and judging &s;uch ca&s;es as are not clearly decided; which would be equally impertinent, if he had openly and plainly a right of de|termining all things according to his will.</P>
<P>But what defect &s;oever may be in any Statutes, no great inconve|niencys could probably en&s;ue, if that for annual Parliaments was ob&s;erv'd, as of right it ought to be. Nothing is more unlikely, than that a great A&s;&s;embly of eminent and cho&s;en men &s;hould make a Law evidently de|&s;tructive to their own de&s;igns; and no mi&s;chief that might emerge upon the di&s;covery of a mi&s;take, could be &s;o extreme that the cure might not be defer'd till the meeting of the Parliament, or at lea&s;t forty days (in which time the King may call one) if that which the Law has fix'd &s;eem to be too long. If he fails of this, he performs not his tru&s;t; and he that would reward &s;uch a breach of it with a va&s;t and uncontrolable power, may be ju&s;tly thought equal in madne&s;s to our Author, who by forbidding us to examin the titles of Kings, and enjoining an intire veneration of the power, by what means &s;oever obtain'd, encourages the wor&s;t of men to murder the be&s;t of Princes, with an a&s;&s;urance that if they pro&s;per they &s;hall enjoy all the honors and advantages that this World can afford.</P>
<P>Princes are not much more beholden to him for the haughty language he puts into their mouths, it having bin ob&s;erv'd that the wor&s;t are al|ways mo&s;t ready to u&s;e it; and their extravagances having bin often cha|&s;tis'd by Law, &s;ufficiently proves, that their power is not deriv'd from a higher original than the Law of their own Countrys.</P>
<P>If it were true, that the an&s;wer &s;ometimes given by Kings to Bills pre|&s;ented for their A&s;&s;ent, did, as our Author &s;ays, amount to a denial, it could only &s;hew that they have a negative voice upon that which is agreed by the Parliament, and is far from a power of acting by them&s;elves, be|ing only a check upon the other parts of the Government. But indeed it is no more than an elu&s;ion; and he that dos by art obliquely elude, confe&s;&s;es he has not a right ab&s;olutely to refu&s;e. 'Tis natural to Kings, e&s;pecially to the wor&s;t, to &s;crue up their Authority to the height; and nothing can more evidently prove the defect of it, than the nece&s;&s;ity of having recour&s;e to &s;uch pitiful eva&s;ions, when they are unwilling to do that which is re|quir'd. But if I &s;hould grant that the words import a denial, and that (notwith&s;tanding tho&s;e of the Coronation Oath, <HI>Quas vulgus elegerit)</HI> they might deny; no more could be infer'd from thence, than that they are en|tru&s;ted with a power equal in that point, to that of either Hou&s;e, and can|not be &s;upreme in our Author's &s;en&s;e, unle&s;s there were in the &s;ame State at the &s;ame time three di&s;tinct &s;upreme and ab&s;olute Powers, which is ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>His ca&s;es relating to the proceedings of the Star Chamber and Council-Table, do only prove that &s;ome Kings have incroach'd upon the rights of the Nation, and bin &s;uffer'd till their exce&s;&s;es growing to be extreme, they turn'd to the ruin of the Mini&s;ters that advis'd them, and &s;ometimes of the Kings them&s;elves. But the Juri&s;diction of the Council having bin re|gulated by the Statute of 17 <HI>Car.</HI> 1. and the Star-Chamber more lately aboli&s;h'd, they are nothing to our di&s;pute.</P>
<P>Such as our Author u&s;ually impute to Trea&s;on and Rebellion the changes that upon the&s;e occa&s;ions have en&s;u'd; but all impartial men do not only ju&s;tify them, but acknowledg that all the Crowns of <HI>Europe</HI> are at this day enjoy'd by no other title than &s;uch Acts &s;olemnly perform'd by the re&s;pe|ctive
<PB N="345" REF="353">
Nations, who either di&s;liking the Per&s;on that pretended to the Crown   (tho next in blood) or the Government of the pre&s;ent Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, have thought fit to prefer another Per&s;on or Family. They al&s;o &s;ay, as that no Government can be &s;o perfect but &s;ome defect may be originally in it, or af|terwards introduc'd, none can &s;ub&s;i&s;t unle&s;s they be from time to time re|duc'd to their fir&s;t integrity, by &s;uch an exertion of the power of tho&s;e for who&s;e &s;ake they were in&s;tituted, as may plainly &s;hew them to be &s;ubject to no power under Heaven, but may do whatever appears to be for their own good. And as the &s;afety of all Nations con&s;i&s;ts in rightly placing and mea&s;uring this Power, &s;uch have bin found always to pro&s;per who have given it to tho&s;e from whom U&s;urpations were lea&s;t to be fear'd, who have bin lea&s;t &s;ubject to be aw'd, cheated or corrupted; and who having the greate&s;t intere&s;t in the Nation, were mo&s;t concern'd to pre&s;erve its power, liberty and welfare. This is the greate&s;t tru&s;t that can be repos'd in men. This power was by the <HI>Spartans</HI> given to the <HI>Ephori</HI> and the Senat of twenty eight; in <HI>Venine</HI> to that which they call <HI>Concilio de Pre|gadi;</HI> in <HI>Germany, Spain, France, Swedeland, Denmark, Poland, Hungary, Bohemia, Scotland, England,</HI> and generally all the Nations that have liv'd under the <HI>Gothick</HI> Polity, it has bin in their General A&s;&s;emblys, under the names of Diets, Cortez, Parliaments, Senats, and the like. But in what hands &s;oever it is, the power of making, abrogating, changing, correct|ing and intepreting Laws, has bin in the &s;ame; Kings have bin rejected or depos'd; the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Crown &s;ettled, regulated or chang'd: and I defy any man to &s;hew me one King among&s;t all the Nations abovemen|tion'd, that has any right to the Crown he wears, unle&s;s &s;uch acts are good.</P>
<P>If this power be not well plac'd, or rightly proportion'd to that which is given to other Magi&s;trats, the State mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily fall into great di&s;|orders, or the mu&s;t violent and dangerous means mu&s;t be frequently us'd to pre&s;erve their Liberty. <HI>Sparta</HI> and <HI>Venice</HI> have rarely bin put to that trouble, becau&s;e the Senats were &s;o much above the Kings and Dukes in power, that they could without difficulty bring them to rea&s;on. The <HI>Gothick</HI> Kings in <HI>Spain</HI> never ventur'd to di&s;pute with the Nobility; and <HI>Witza</HI> and <HI>Rodrigo</HI> expos'd the Kingdom as a prey to the <HI>Moors,</HI> rather by weakning it thro the neglect of Military di&s;ciplin, join'd to their own ignorance and cowardice, and by evil example bringing the youth to re|&s;emble them in leudne&s;s and ba&s;ene&s;s, than by e&s;tabli&s;hing in them&s;elves a power above the Law. But in <HI>England</HI> our Ance&s;tors, who &s;eem to have had &s;ome &s;uch thing in their eye, as balancing the powers, by a fatal mi|&s;take plac'd u&s;ually &s;o much in the hands of the King, that when&s;oever he happen'd to be bad, his extravagances could not be repre&s;t without great danger. And as this has in &s;everal ages co&s;t the Nation a va&s;t proportion of generous blood, &s;o 'tis the cau&s;e of our pre&s;ent difficultys, and threatens us with more, but can never deprive usof the rights we inherit from our fathers.</P>

  interpret them and decide hard ca&s;es, it plainly appears there can be no truth in our Author's a&s;&s;ertion, That <HI>the King is the Author, Corrector and Moderator of both Statute and Common Law:</HI> and nothing can be more frivolous than what he adds, that <HI>neither of them can be a diminution of that natural power which Kings have over their People as fathers;</HI> in as much as the differences between paternal and monarchical Power (as he a&s;&s;erts it) are va&s;t and irreconcilable in principle and practice, as I have prov'd at large in the former parts of this Work.</P>
<P><HI>But le&s;t we &s;hould be too proud of the honor he is pleas'd to do to our Parliaments by making u&s;e of their Authority, he &s;ays,</HI> We are first to re|member that till the Conquest <HI>(which name for the glory of our Nation he gives to the coming in of the</HI> Normans) there could be no Parliament a&s;|&s;embled of the General States, becau&s;e we cannot learn that until tho&s;e days it was intirely united in one. <HI>Secondly he doubts,</HI> Whether the Parlia|ment in the time of the <HI>Saxons</HI> were compos'd of the Nobility and Clergy, or whether the Commons were al&s;o call'd; <HI>but concludes,</HI> there could be no Knights of any Shires, becau&s;e there were no Shires. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> That <HI>Henry</HI> the First caus'd the Commons first to a&s;&s;emble Knights and Burge&s;&s;es of their own chu&s;ing; <HI>and would make this to be an Act of grace and favor from that King: but adds, that</HI> it had bin more for the honor of Parliaments, if a King who&s;e title to the Crown had bin better, had bin the Author of the form of it.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to the fir&s;t, I do not think my &s;elf oblig'd to in&s;i&s;t upon the name or form of the Parliament; for the Authority of a Magi&s;tracy pro|ceeds not from the number of years that it has continu'd, but the recti|tude of the In&s;titution, and the Authority of tho&s;e that in&s;tituted it. The power of <HI>Saul, David</HI> and <HI>Jeroboam</HI> was the &s;ame with that which be|long'd to the la&s;t Kings of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and <HI>Judah.</HI> The Authority of the <HI>Ro|man</HI> Con&s;uls, Dictators, Pretors and Tribuns, was the &s;ame as &s;oon as it was e&s;tabli&s;h'd; was as legal and ju&s;t as that of the Kings of <HI>Denmark,</HI> which is &s;aid to have continu'd above three thou&s;and years. For as time can make nothing lawful or ju&s;t, that is not &s;o of it &s;elf (tho men are unwilling to change that which has pleas'd their Ance&s;tors, unle&s;s they di&s;cover great inconveniences in it) that which a People dos rightly e&s;ta|bli&s;h for their own good, is of as much force the fir&s;t day, as continuance can ever give to it: and therefore in matters of the greate&s;t importance, wi&s;e and good men do not &s;o much inquire what has bin, as what is good and ought to be; for that which of it &s;elf is evil, by continuance is made wor&s;e, and upon the fir&s;t opportunity is ju&s;tly to be aboli&s;h'd. But if that Liberty in which God created man, can receive any &s;trength from continuance, and the rights of <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> can be render'd more unque|&s;tionable by pre&s;cription, I &s;ay that the Nations who&s;e rights we inherit, have ever enjoy'd the Libertys we claim, and always exercis'd them in go|verning them&s;elves popularly, or by &s;uch Repre&s;entatives as have bin in&s;ti|tuted by them&s;elves, from the time they were fir&s;t known in the World.</P>

  'Tis as ea&s;ily prov'd that the <HI>Saxons</HI> or <HI>Angli,</HI> from whom we de&s;cend, were eminent among tho&s;e, who&s;e power, vertue, and love to Liberty the abovemention'd Hi&s;torian &s;o highly extols, in as much as be&s;ides what he &s;ays in general of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> he names the <HI>Angli;</HI> de&s;cribes their ha|bitation near the <HI>Elb,</HI> and their religious wor&s;hip of the Godde&s;s <HI>Erthum,</HI> or the Earth, celebrated in an I&s;land lying in the mouth of that River, thought to be <HI>Heyligland;</HI> in re&s;emblance of which a &s;mall one lying over again&s;t <HI>Berwick,</HI> is call'd Holy I&s;land. If they were free in their own Country, they mu&s;t have bin &s;o when they came hither. The manner of their coming &s;hews they were more likely to impo&s;e, than &s;ub|mit to &s;lavery; and if they had not the name of Parliament, it was becau&s;e they did not &s;peak <HI>French;</HI> or, not being yet join'd with the <HI>Normans,</HI> they had not thought fit to put their Affairs into that method: but having the root of Power and Liberty in them&s;elves, they could not but have a right of e&s;tabli&s;hing the one in &s;uch a form as be&s;t pleas'd them, for the pre&s;ervation of the other.</P>
<P>This being, as I &s;uppo&s;e, undeniable, it imports not whether the A&s;|&s;emblys in which the Supreme Power of each Nation did re&s;ide, were frequent or rare; compos'd of many or few Per&s;ons, &s;itting altogether in one place, or in more; what name they had; or whether every Free man did meet and vote in his own per&s;on, or a few were delegated by many. For they who have a Right inherent in them&s;elves, may re&s;ign it to others; and they who can give a Power to others, may exerci&s;e it them&s;elves, unle&s;s they recede from it by their own act; for it is only matter of convenience, of which they alone can be the Judges, becau&s;e 'tis for them&s;elves only that they judg. If this were not &s;o, it would be very prejudicial to Kings: for 'tis certain that <HI>Ca&s;&s;ivellaunus, Caractatus, Arvi|ragus, Galgacus, Hengist, Hor&s;a,</HI> and others among&s;t the <HI>Britans</HI> and <HI>Saxons,</HI> what name &s;oever may have bin abu&s;ively given to them, were only temporary Magi&s;trats cho&s;en upon occa&s;ion of pre&s;ent Wars; but we know of no time in which the <HI>Britans</HI> had not their Great Council to determin their mo&s;t important Affairs: and the <HI>Saxons</HI> in their own Coun|try had their Councils, where all were pre&s;ent, and in which <HI>Taci|tus</HI> a&s;&s;ures us they di&s;patch'd their greate&s;t Bu&s;ine&s;s. The&s;e were the &s;ame with the <HI>Micklegemots</HI> which they afterwards held here, and might have bin call'd by the &s;ame name, if <HI>Tacitus</HI> had &s;poken <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>If a People therefore have not a power to create at any time a Magi|&s;tracy which they had not before, none could be created at all, for no Magi&s;tracy is eternal: And if for the validity of the Con&s;titution it be nece&s;&s;ary, that the beginning mu&s;t be unknown, or that no other could have bin before it, the Monarchy among&s;t us cannot be e&s;tabli&s;h'd up|on any right; for tho our Ance&s;tors had their Councils and Magi&s;trats, as well here as in <HI>Germany,</HI> they had no Monarchs. This appears plain|ly by the te&s;timony of <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Tacitus;</HI> and our later Hi&s;torys &s;how, that as &s;oon as the <HI>Saxons</HI> came into this Country, they had their <HI>Mickle|gemots,</HI> which were general A&s;&s;emblys of the Noble and Free men, who had in them&s;elves the Power of the Nation: and tho when they in|creas'd in numbers, they erected &s;even Kingdoms, yet every one re|tain'd the &s;ame u&s;age within it &s;elf. The&s;e A&s;&s;emblys were evident|ly the &s;ame in power with our Parliaments; and tho they differ'd in name or form, it matters not, for they who could act in the one, could not but have a power of in&s;tituting the other; that is, the &s;ame People that could meet together in their own Per&s;ons, and according to their
<PB N="349" REF="357">
own plea&s;ure order all matters relating to them&s;elves, whil&s;t three or   four Countys only were under one Government, and their numbers were not &s;o great, or their habitation &s;o far di&s;tant, that they might not meet al|together without inconvenience, with the &s;ame Right might depute others to repre&s;ent them, when being join'd in one, no place was capable of re|ceiving &s;o great a multitude, and that the Frontiers would have bin expos'd to the danger of foreign Inva&s;ions, if any &s;uch thing had bin practis'd.</P>
<P>But if the Authority of Parliaments, for many Ages repre&s;enting the whole Nation, were le&s;s to be valu'd (as our Author in&s;inuates) becau&s;e they could not repre&s;ent the whole, when it was not join'd in one Body, that of Kings mu&s;t come to nothing; for there could be no one King over all, when the Nation was divided into &s;even di&s;tinct Governments: And 'tis mo&s;t ab&s;urd to think that the Nation, which had &s;even Great Councils, or Micklegemots, at the &s;ame time they had &s;even Kingdoms, could not as well unite the &s;even Councils as the &s;even Kingdoms into one. 'Tis to as little purpo&s;e to &s;ay, that the Nation did not unite it &s;elf, but the &s;everal parcels came to be inherited by one; for that one could inherit no more from the others than what they had; and the &s;even being only Ma|gi&s;trats &s;et up by the Micklegemots, &amp;c. the one mu&s;t be al&s;o. And 'tis neither rea&s;onable to imagin, nor po&s;&s;ible to prove, that a fierce Nation, jealous of Liberty, and who had ob&s;tinately defended it in <HI>Germany</HI> a|gain&s;t all Invaders, &s;hould conquer this Country to en&s;lave them&s;elves, and purcha&s;e nothing by their Valor but that Servitude which they abhor'd; or be le&s;s free when they were united into one State, than they had bin when they were divided into &s;even; and lea&s;t of all, that one man could fir&s;t &s;ubdue his own People, and then all the re&s;t, when by endeavouring to &s;ubdue his own, he had broken the Tru&s;t repos'd in him, and lo&s;t the Right confer'd upon him, and without them had not power to &s;ubdue any. But as it is my fate almo&s;t ever to di&s;&s;ent from our Author, I affirm, That the variety of Government, which is ob&s;erv'd to have bin among&s;t the <HI>Saxons,</HI> who in &s;ome Ages were divided, in others united; &s;ometimes under Captains, at other times under Kings; &s;ometimes meeting per&s;onally in the Micklege|mots, &s;ometimes by their Delegats in the Wittenagemots, dos evi|dently te&s;tify, that they order'd all things according to their own plea|&s;ure; which being the utmo&s;t Act of Liberty, it remain'd inviolable under all tho&s;e changes, as we have already prov'd by the Examples of <HI>Offa, Ina, Alfred, Canutus, Edward,</HI> and other particular, as well as univer&s;al Kings: And we may be &s;ure tho&s;e of the <HI>Norman</HI> Race can have no more power, &s;ince they came in by the &s;ame way, and &s;wore to govern by the &s;ame Laws.</P>
<P>2. I am no way concern'd in our Author's doubt, <HI>Whether Parlia|ments did in tho&s;e days con&s;ist of Nobility and Clergy; or, Whether the Commons were al&s;o call'd.</HI> For if it were true, as he a&s;&s;erts, that ac|cording to the eternal Law of God and Nature, there can be no Go|vernment in the World but that of an ab&s;olute Monarch, who&s;e Sove|reign Maje&s;ty can be dimini&s;h'd by no Law or Cu&s;tom, there could be Parliaments, or other Magi&s;tracys, that did not derive their Power and Being from his Will. But having prov'd that the <HI>Saxons</HI> had their Gene|ral Councils and A&s;&s;emblys when they had no Kings; that by them Kings were made, and the greate&s;t Affairs determin'd, whether they had Kings or not; it can be of no importance, whether in one or more Ages the Commons had a part in the Government, or not. For the &s;ame
<PB N="350" REF="358">
  Power that in&s;tituted a Parliament without them, might, when they thought fit, receive them into it: or rather, if they who had the Govern|ment in their hands, did, for rea&s;ons known to them&s;elves, recede from the exerci&s;e of it, they might re&s;ume it when they pleas'd.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s it may be worth our pains to inquire what our Au|thor means by Nobility. If &s;uch, as at this day by means of Patents ob|tain'd for mony, or by favor, without any regard to Merit in the Per&s;ons or their Ance&s;tors, are call'd Dukes, Marque&s;&s;es, &amp;c. I give him leave to impute as late and ba&s;e an Original to them as he plea&s;es, without fear|ing that the Rights of our Nation can thereby be impair'd; and am con|tent, that if the King do not think fit to &s;upport the Dignity of his own Creatures, they may fall. But if by Noblemen we are to under&s;tand &s;uch as have bin ennobl'd by the vertues of their Ance&s;tors, manife&s;ted in Services done to their Country, I &s;ay, that all Nations, among&s;t whom Vertue has bin e&s;teem'd, have had a great regard to them and their Po|&s;terity: and tho Kings, when they were made, have bin entru&s;ted by the <HI>Saxons,</HI> and other Nations, with a Power of ennobling tho&s;e who by Services render'd to their Country might de&s;erve that Honor, yet the Body of the Nobility was more antient than &s;uch; for it had bin equally impo&s;&s;ible <HI>to take</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Reges ex nobilitate, duces ex virtute &s;umere.</P>

<P>As among the <HI>Turks,</HI> and mo&s;t of the Ea&s;tern Tyrannys, there is no Nobility, and no man has any con&s;iderable advantage above the common People, unle&s;s by the immediate favor of the Prince; &s;o in all the legal Kingdoms of the North, the &s;trength of the Government has always bin plac'd in the Nobility; and no better defence has bin found again&s;t the en|croachments of ill Kings, than by &s;etting up an Order of Men, who by holding large Territorys, and having great numbers of Tenants and De|pendents, might be able to re&s;train the exorbitances, that either the Kings or the Commons might run into. For this end <HI>Spain, Germany, France, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, Scotland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> were almo&s;t wholly di|vided into Lord&s;hips under &s;everal names, by which every particular Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or ow'd Allegiance (that is, &s;uch an Obedience as the Law requires) to the King, and he reciprocally &s;wore to perform that which the &s;ame Law exacted from him.</P>
<P>When the&s;e Nations were converted to the Chri&s;tian Religion, they had a great veneration for the Clergy; and not doubting that the Men
<PB N="351" REF="359">
whom they e&s;teem'd holy, would be ju&s;t, thought their Libertys could   not be better &s;ecur'd, than by joining tho&s;e who had the direction of their Con&s;ciences, to the Noblemen who had the command of their Forces. This &s;ucceeded &s;o well (in relation to the defence of the publick Rights) that in all the foremention'd States, the Bi&s;hops, Abbots, &amp;c. were no le&s;s zealous or bold in defending the publick Liberty, than the be&s;t and greate&s;t of the Lords: And if it were true, that things being thus e&s;tabli&s;h'd, the Commons did neither per&s;onally, nor by their Repre&s;entatives, enter into the General A&s;&s;emblys, it could be of no advantage to Kings; for &s;uch a Power as is abovemention'd, is equally incon&s;i&s;tent with the ab&s;olute Sove|reignty of Kings, if plac'd in the Nobility and Clergy, as if the Commons had a part. If the King has all, no other Man, nor number of Men can have any. If the Nobility and Clergy have the power, the Commons may have their &s;hare al&s;o. But I affirm, that tho&s;e whom we now call Commons, have always had a part in the Government, and their place in the Councils that manag'd it; for if there was a di&s;tinction, it mu&s;t have bin by Patent, Birth, or Tenure.</P>
<P>As for Patents, we know they began long after the coming of the <HI>Nor|mans;</HI> and tho&s;e that now have them cannot pretend to any advantage on ac|count of Birth or Tenure, beyond many of tho&s;e who have them not. Nay, be&s;ides the &s;everal Branches of the Familys that now enjoy the mo&s;t an|tient Honors, which con&s;equently are as noble as they, and &s;ome of them of the elder Hou&s;es, we know many that are now call'd Commoners, who in antiquity and eminency are no way inferior to the chief of the titular Nobility: and nothing can be more ab&s;urd, than to give a Prerogative of Birth to <HI>Cr-v-n, T-ft-n, H-de, B-nn-t, Osb-rn,</HI> and others, before the <HI>Cliftons, Hampdens, Courtneys, Pelhams, St. Johns, Baintons, Wilbrahams, Hungerfords,</HI> and many others. And if the Tenures of their E&s;tates be con&s;ider'd, they have the &s;ame, and as antient as any of tho&s;e who go un|der the names of Duke, or Marque&s;s. I forbear to mention the &s;ordid ways of attaining to Titles in our days; but whoever will take the pains to examin them, &s;hall find that they rather defile than ennoble the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ors. And whereas Men are truly ennobl'd only by Vertue, and re&s;pect is due to &s;uch as are de&s;cended from tho&s;e who have bravely &s;erv'd their Country, becau&s;e it is pre&s;um'd (till they &s;hew the contrary) that they will re&s;emble their Ance&s;tors, the&s;e modern Courtiers, by their Names and Titles, frequently oblige us to call to mind &s;uch things as are not to be men|tion'd without blu&s;hing. Whatever the antient Noblemen of <HI>England</HI> were, we are &s;ure they were not &s;uch as the&s;e. And tho it &s;hould be confe&s;t that no others than Dukes, Marque&s;&s;es, Earls, Vi&s;counts, and Barons, had their places in the Councils mention'd by <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Tacitus,</HI> or in the great A&s;&s;emblys of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> it could be of no advantage to &s;uch as are now call'd by tho&s;e names. They were the titles of Offices confer'd upon tho&s;e, who did and could be&s;t conduct the People in time of War; give Coun|&s;el to the King; admini&s;ter Ju&s;tice, and perform other publick dutys; but were never made hereditary except by abu&s;e; much le&s;s were they &s;old for mony, or given as recompences of the vile&s;t &s;ervices. If the an|tient Order be totally inverted, and the ends of its In&s;titution perverted, they who from thence pretend to be di&s;tingui&s;h'd from other men, mu&s;t build their Claim upon &s;omething very different from Antiquity.</P>
<P>This being &s;ufficient (if I mi&s;take not) to make it appear, That the antient Councils of our Nation did not con&s;i&s;t of &s;uch as we now call Noblemen, it may be worth our pains to examin of what &s;ort of men they

<P>If any man ask how the Nobility came to be &s;o numerous; I an&s;wer, That the Northern Nations, who were perpetually in Arms, put a high e&s;teem upon Military Valor; &s;ought by conque&s;t to acquire better Coun|trys than their own; valu'd them&s;elves according to the numbers of men they could bring into the field; and to di&s;tingui&s;h them from Villains, call'd tho&s;e Noblemen, who nobly defended and enlarg'd their Domini|ons by War; and for a reward of their Services, in the divi&s;ion of Lands gain'd by conque&s;t, they di&s;tributed to them Freeholds, under the obliga|tion of continuing the &s;ame Service to their Country. This appears by the name of Knights Service, a Knight being no more than a Soldier, and a Knight's Fee no more than was &s;ufficient to maintain one. 'Tis plain, that Knighthood was always e&s;teem'd Nobility; &s;o that no man, of what quality &s;oever, thought a Knight inferior to him, and tho&s;e of the highe&s;t birth could not act as Noblemen till they were knighted. Among the <HI>Goths</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> the cutting off the Hair (which being long was the mark of Knighthood) was accounted a degrading, and look'd upon to be &s;o great a mark of Infamy, that he who had &s;uffer'd it, could never bear any honor or office in the Commonwealth; and there was no dignity &s;o high, but e|very Knight was capable of it. There was no di&s;tinction of men above it, and even to this day <HI>Baron,</HI> or <HI>Varon,</HI> in their Language, &s;ignifys no more than <HI>Vir</HI> in Latin, which is not properly given to any man unle&s;s he be free. The like was in <HI>France</HI> till the coming in of the third race of Kings, in which time the 12 Peers (of whom 6 only were Laymen) were rais'd to a higher dignity, and the Commands annex'd made hereditary; but
<PB N="353" REF="361">
the honor of Knighthood was thereby no way dimini&s;h'd. Tho there   were Dukes, Earls, Marque&s;&s;es and Barons in the time of <HI>Froi&s;&s;art,</HI> yet he u&s;ually calls them Knights: And <HI>Philip de Commines,</HI> &s;peaking of the mo&s;t eminent men of his time, calls them good, wi&s;e or valiant Knights. Even to this day the name of Gentleman comprehends all that is rais'd above the common people: <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth u&s;ually call'd him&s;elf the fir&s;t Gentleman in <HI>France;</HI> and 'tis an ordinary phra&s;e among them, when they &s;peak of a Gentleman of good Birth, to &s;ay, <HI>Il e&s;t noble comme le Roy, He is as noble as the King.</HI> In their General A&s;&s;embly of E&s;tates, <HI>The Chamber of the Noble&s;&s;e,</HI> which is one of Three, is compos'd of the Deputys &s;ent by the Gentry of every Province; and in the inquiry made about the Year 1668 concerning Nobility, no notice was taken of &s;uch as had a&s;&s;um'd the Titles of Earl, Marque&s;s, Vi&s;count, or Baron, but only of tho&s;e who call'd them&s;elves Gentlemen; and if they could prove that name to belong to them, they were left to u&s;e the other Titles as they pleas'd. When Duels were in fa&s;hion (as all know they were lately) no man except the Princes of the Blood, and Marechals of <HI>France,</HI> could with honor refu&s;e a Challenge from any Gentleman: The fir&s;t, becau&s;e it was thought unfit, that he who might be King, &s;hould fight with a Subject to the danger of the Commonwealth, which might by that means be depriv'd of its Head: The others being by their Office Commanders of the Nobility, and Judges of all the Controver&s;ys relating to Honor that happen among&s;t them, cannot rea&s;onably be brought into private Conte&s;ts with any. In <HI>Denmark Nobleman</HI> and <HI>Gentleman</HI> is the &s;ame thing, and till the year 1660, they had the principal part of the Govern|ment in their hands. When <HI>Charles Gu&s;tavus,</HI> King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> invaded <HI>Poland</HI> in the year 1655, 'tis &s;aid, that there were above three hundred thou&s;and Gentlemen in Arms to re&s;i&s;t him. This is the Nobility of that Country, Kings are cho&s;en by them: Every one of them will &s;ay, as in <HI>France, He is noble as the King.</HI> The la&s;t King was a private man among them, not thought to have had more than four hundred pounds a year. He who now reigns was not at all above him in birth or e&s;tate, till he had rais'd him&s;elf by great &s;ervices done for his Country in many wars; and there was not one Gentleman in the Nation who might not have bin cho&s;en as well as he, if it had pleas'd the A&s;&s;embly that did it.</P>
<P>This being the Nobility of the Northern Nations, and the true Baro|nage of <HI>England,</HI> 'tis no wonder that they were call'd <HI>Nobiles,</HI> the mo&s;t eminent among them <HI>Magnates, Principes, Proceres;</HI> and &s;o numerous that they were e&s;teem'd to be <HI>Multitudo infinita.</HI> One place was hardly able to contain them; and the inconveniences of calling them all together appear'd to be &s;o great, that in time they cho&s;e rather to meet by Repre|&s;entatives, than every one in his own per&s;on. The power therefore re|maining in them, it matters not what method they ob&s;erv'd in the execu|tion. They who had the &s;ub&s;tance in their hands, might give it what form they pleas'd. Our Author &s;ufficiently manife&s;ts his ignorance, in &s;aying there could be no Knights of the Shires in the time of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> becau&s;e there were no Shires; for the very word is <HI>Saxon,</HI> and we find the names of <HI>Bark&s;hire, Wilt&s;hire, Devon&s;hire, Dor&s;et&s;hire,</HI> and others mo&s;t frequently in the writings of tho&s;e times; and Dukes, Earls, Thanes or Aldermen, appointed to command the Forces, and look to the di&s;tribution of Ju&s;tice in them. <HI>Selden</HI> cites <HI>Ingulphus</HI> for &s;aying, that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Selden<HI>'s Tit. of Honor,</HI> p. 2. c. 5.</NOTE><HI>Alfred was the fir&s;t that chang'd the Provinces, &amp;c. into Countys:</HI> but re|futes him, and proves that the di&s;tinction of the Land into Shires or
<PB N="354" REF="362">
  Countys (for Shire &s;ignify'd no more than the &s;hare or part committed to the care of the Earl or <HI>Comes)</HI> was far more antient. Whether the fir&s;t divi&s;ions by the <HI>Saxons</HI> were greater or le&s;&s;er than the Shires or Coun|tys now are, is nothing to the que&s;tion: they who made them to be as they were, could have made them greater or le&s;&s;er as they pleas'd. And whether they did immediately, or &s;ome ages after that di&s;tinction, cea&s;e to come to their great A&s;&s;emblys, and rather chu&s;e to &s;end their Deputys; or whether &s;uch Deputys were cho&s;en by Countys, Citys and Boroughs, as in our days, or in any other manner, can be of no advantage or preju|dice to the Cau&s;e that I maintain. If the power of the Nation, when it was divided into &s;even Kingdoms, or united under one, did re&s;ide in the Micklegemots or Wittenagemots; if the&s;e con&s;i&s;ted of the Nobility and People, who were &s;ometimes &s;o numerous that no one place could well contain them; and if the preference given to the chief among them, was on account of the Offices they executed, either in relation to war or ju&s;tice, which no man can deny, I have as much as &s;erves for my pur|po&s;e. 'Tis indifferent to me, whether they were call'd Earls, Dukes, Aldermen, Herotoghs or Thanes; for 'tis certain that the titular Nobi|lity now in mode among&s;t us has no re&s;emblance to this antient Nobility of <HI>England.</HI> The novelty therefore is on the other &s;ide, and that of the wor&s;t &s;ort; becau&s;e by giving the name of Noblemen (which antiently belong'd to &s;uch as had the greate&s;t intere&s;ts in Nations, and were the &s;upporters of their Liberty) to Court-creatures, who often have none, and either acquire their Honors by mony, or are prefer'd for &s;ervile and &s;ometimes impure &s;ervices render'd to the Per&s;on that reigns, or el&s;e for mi&s;chiefs done to their Country, the Con&s;titution has bin wholly in|verted, and the tru&s;t repos'd in the Kings (who in &s;ome mea&s;ure had the di&s;po&s;al of Offices and Honors) mi&s;employ'd. This is farther aggravated by appropriating the name of Noblemen &s;olely to them; whereas the Nation having bin antiently divided only into Freemen or Noblemen (who were the &s;ame) and Villains; the fir&s;t were, as <HI>Tacitus</HI> &s;ays of their An|ce&s;tors the <HI>Germans,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exempti oneribus &amp; collationibus, &amp; tantum in u&s;um praliorum repo&s;iti, v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">luti tela &amp; arma <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">llis re&s;ervantur. <BIBL><HI>Corn.

And I leave any rea&s;onable man to judg, whether the latter condition be that of tho&s;e we now call Commoners. Neverthele&s;s, he that will be|lieve the title of Noblemen &s;till to belong to tho&s;e only who are &s;o by Patent, may gue&s;s how well our wars would be manag'd if they were left &s;olely to &s;uch as are &s;o by that title. If this be approv'd, his Maje&s;ty may do well with his hundred and fifty Noblemen, eminent in valor and military experience as they are known to be, to make &s;uch wars as may fall upon him, and leave the de&s;pis'd Commons under the name of Vil|lains, to provide for them&s;elves if the &s;ucce&s;s do not an&s;wer his expecta|tions. But if the Commons are as free as the Nobles, many of them in birth equal to the Patentees, in E&s;tate &s;uperior to mo&s;t of them; and that it is not only expected they &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t him in wars with their Per&s;ons and Pur&s;es, but acknowledg'd by all, that the &s;trength and vertue of the Nation is in them it mu&s;t be confe&s;t that they are true Noblemen of <HI>England,</HI> and that all the privileges antiently enjoy'd by &s;uch, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily belong to them, &s;ince they perform the Offices to which they were
<PB N="355" REF="363">
annex'd. This &s;hews how the Nobility were ju&s;tly &s;aid to be almo&s;t   infinite in number, &s;o that no one place was able to contain them. The <HI>Saxon</HI> Armys that came over into this Country to a whole&s;om and gene|rative climat, might well increa&s;e in four or five ages to tho&s;e va&s;t num|bers, as the <HI>Franks, Goths</HI> and others had done in <HI>Spain, France, Italy,</HI> and other parts: and when they were grown &s;o numerous, they found them&s;elves nece&s;&s;arily oblig'd to put the power into the hands of Repre|&s;entatives cho&s;en by them&s;elves, which they had before exercis'd in their own per&s;ons. But the&s;e two ways differing rather in form than e&s;&s;entially, the one tending to Democracy, the other to Ari&s;tocracy, they are equally oppo&s;ite to the ab&s;olute dominion of one man reigning for him&s;elf, and governing the Nation as his Patrimony; and equally a&s;&s;ert the rights of the People to put the Government into &s;uch a form as be&s;t plea&s;es them|&s;elves. This was &s;utable to what they had practis'd in their own Coun|try; <HI>De minoribus con&s;ultant Principes, de majoribus omnes.</HI> Nay, even <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tacit. de mor&punc; Germ.</NOTE>the&s;e <HI>&s;maller matters</HI> cannot be &s;aid properly to relate to the King; for he is but one, and the word <HI>Principes</HI> is in the plural number, and can only &s;ignify &s;uch principal men, as the &s;ame Author &s;ays were cho&s;en by the General A&s;&s;emblys to do ju&s;tice, &amp;c. and to each of them one hundred <HI>Comites</HI> join'd, not only to give advice, but authority to their actions.</P>
<P>The word <HI>Omnes</HI> &s;poken by a <HI>Roman,</HI> mu&s;t likewi&s;e be under&s;tood as it was us'd by them, and imports all the Citizens, or &s;uch as made up the body of the Commonwealth. If he had &s;poken of <HI>Rome</HI> or <HI>Athens</HI> whil&s;t they remain'd free, he mu&s;t have us'd the &s;ame word (becau&s;e all tho&s;e of whom the City con&s;i&s;ted had votes) how great &s;oever the num|ber of &s;laves or &s;trangers might have bin. The <HI>Spartans</HI> are rightly &s;aid to have gain'd, lo&s;t and recover'd the Lord&s;hip or Principality of <HI>Greece.</HI> They were all Lords in relation to their <HI>Helots;</HI> and &s;o were the <HI>Dorians</HI> in relation to that &s;ort of men, which under &s;everal names they kept, as the <HI>Saxons</HI> did their Villains, for the performance of the Offices which they thought too mean for tho&s;e who were ennobl'd by Liberty, and the u&s;e of Arms, by which the Commonwealth was defended and enlarg'd. Tho the <HI>Romans</HI> &s;corn'd to give the title of Lord to tho&s;e who had u&s;urp'd a power over their Lives and Fortunes; yet every one of them was a Lord in relation to his own Servants, and altogether are often call'd <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Romanos rerum Dominos. <BIBL>Virg.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>Lords of the world:</HI> the like is &s;een almo&s;t every where. The Government of <HI>Venice</HI> having continu'd for many ages in the &s;ame Familys, has ennobl'd them all. No phra&s;e is more common in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> than <HI>the Lords of Bern,</HI> or <HI>the Lords of Zurich</HI> and other places, tho perhaps there is not a man among&s;t them who pretends to be a Gentleman, according to the modern &s;en&s;e put upon that word. The States of the United Provinces are call'd High and Mighty Lords, and the &s;ame title is given to each of them in particular. Nay, the word <HI>Heer,</HI> which &s;ignifys Lord both in high and low <HI>Dutch,</HI> is as common as Mon&s;ieur in <HI>France,</HI> Signor in <HI>Italy,</HI> or Sennor in <HI>Spain;</HI> and is given to every one who is not of a &s;ordid con|dition, but e&s;pecially to Soldiers: and tho a common Soldier be now a much meaner thing than it was antiently, no man &s;peaking to a company of Soldiers in <HI>Italian,</HI> u&s;es any other &s;tile than <HI>Signori Soldati;</HI> and the like is done in other Languages. 'Tis not therefore to be thought &s;trange, if the <HI>Saxons,</HI> who in their own Country had &s;corn'd any other employ|ment than that of the Sword, &s;hould think them&s;elves farther ennobl'd,

  when by their Arms they had acquir'd a great and rich Country, and driven out or &s;ubdu'd the former inhabitants. They might well di&s;tin|gui&s;h them&s;elves from the Villains they brought with them, or the <HI>Britans</HI> they had en&s;lav'd. They might well be call'd <HI>Magnates, Proceres regni, Nobiles, Angliae Nobilitas, Barones;</HI> and the A&s;&s;emblys of them ju&s;tly call'd <HI>Concilium Regni Generale, &V;niver&s;itas totius Angliae Nobilium, &V;ni|ver&s;itas Baronagii,</HI> according to the variety of times and other occurrences. We have &s;uch foot&s;teps remaining of the name of Baron, as plainly &s;hew the &s;ignification of it. The Barons of <HI>London</HI> and the Cinq Ports are known to be only the Freemen of tho&s;e places. In the petty Court&punc;Ba|rons, every man who may be of a Jury is a Baron. The&s;e are Noble|men; for there are noble Nations as well as noble men in Nations. The <HI>Mammalukes</HI> accounted them&s;elves to be all noble, tho born &s;laves; and when they had ennobl'd them&s;elves by the u&s;e of Arms, they look'd up|on the noble&s;t of the <HI>Egyptians</HI> as their &s;laves. <HI>Tertullian</HI> writing, not to &s;ome eminent men, but to the whole People of <HI>Carthage,</HI> calls them <HI>An|tiquitate Nobiles, Nobilitate felices.</HI> Such were the <HI>Saxons,</HI> ennobl'd by a perpetual application to tho&s;e exerci&s;es that belong to Noblemen, and an abhorrence to any thing that is vile and &s;ordid.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXIX.   The King was never Ma&s;ter of the Soil.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE who without regard to truth, re&s;olve to in&s;i&s;t upon &s;uch points as they think may &s;erve their de&s;igns, when they find it can|not be deny'd that the powers before mention'd have bin exercis'd by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and other Nations, &s;ay, that they were the conce&s;&s;ions of Kings, who being ma&s;ters of the Soil, might be&s;tow parcels upon &s;ome Per&s;ons with &s;uch conditions as they pleas'd, retaining to them&s;elves the &s;upreme dominion of the whole: and having already, as they think, made them the Fountains of Honor, they proceed to make them al&s;o the Fountains of Property; and for proof of this alledg, that all Lands, tho held of mean Lords, do by their Tenures at la&s;t re&s;ult upon the King, as the Head from whom they are enjoy'd. This might be of force if it were true: but matters of the highe&s;t importance requiring a mo&s;t evident proof, we are to examin, Fir&s;t, if it be po&s;&s;ible; and in the next place, if it be true.</P>
<P>1. For the fir&s;t; No man can give what he has not. Whoever there|fore will pretend that the King has be&s;tow'd this propriety, mu&s;t prove that he had it in him&s;elf. I confe&s;s, that the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portu|gal</HI> obtain'd from the Pope grants of the Territorys they po&s;&s;e&s;t in the <HI>We&s;t-Indys;</HI> and this might be of &s;ome &s;trength, if the Pope as Vicar of Chri&s;t had an ab&s;olute dominion over the whole earth; but if that fail, the whole falls to the ground, and he is ridiculou&s;ly liberal of that which no way belongs to him. My bu&s;ine&s;s is not to di&s;pute that point; but before it can have any influence upon our Affairs, our Kings are to prove, that they are Lords of <HI>England</HI> upon the &s;ame Title, or &s;ome other equi|valent to it. When that is done, we &s;hall know upon whom they have a dependence, and may at lei&s;ure con&s;ider, whether we ought to acknow|ledg and &s;ubmit to &s;uch a Power, or give rea&s;ons for our re&s;u&s;al. But there being no &s;uch thing in our pre&s;ent ca&s;e, their property mu&s;t be grounded upon &s;omething el&s;e, or we may ju&s;tly conclude they have none.</P>
<P>In order to this 'tis hardly worth the pains to &s;earch into the ob&s;cure remains of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;torys: For when the <HI>Romans</HI> de&s;erted our I&s;land, they did not confer the right they had (whether more or le&s;s) up|on any man, but left the enjoyment of it to the poor remainders of the Nation, and their own e&s;tabli&s;h'd Colonys, who were grown to be one People with the Natives. The <HI>Saxons</HI> came under the conduct of <HI>Hengi&s;t</HI> and <HI>Hor&s;a,</HI> who &s;eem to have bin &s;turdy Pirats; but did not (that I can learn) bear any Characters in their per&s;ons of the &s;o much admir'd So|vereign Maje&s;ty, that &s;hould give them an ab&s;olute dominion or pro|priety, either in their own Country, or any other they &s;hould &s;et their feet upon. They came with about a hundred men; and chu&s;ing rather <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. We&s;t. Flor. Hi&s;t.</NOTE>to &s;erve <HI>Vortigern,</HI> than to depend upon what they could get by rapine at Sea, liv'd upon a &s;mall proportion of Land by him allotted to them. Tho this &s;eems to be but a &s;lender encouragement, yet it was enough to invite many others to follow their Example and Fortune; &s;o that their
<PB N="358" REF="366">
  number increa&s;ing, the County of <HI>Kent</HI> was given to them, under the obligation of &s;erving the <HI>Britans</HI> in their Wars. Not long after, Lands in <HI>Northumberland</HI> were be&s;tow'd upon another company of them with the &s;ame condition. This was all the Title they had to what they enjoy'd, till they treacherou&s;ly kill'd four hundred and &s;ixty, or, as <HI>William</HI> of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE><HI>Malmsbury</HI> &s;ays, three hundred principal men of the Nobility, and made <HI>Vortigern</HI> Pri&s;oner, who had bin &s;o much their Benefactor, that he &s;eems never to have de&s;erv'd well but from them, and to have incens'd the <HI>Britans</HI> by the favor he &s;hew'd them, as much as by the wor&s;t of his Vices. And certainly actions of this kind, compos'd of fal&s;hood and cruelty, can never create a right, in the opinion of any better men than <HI>Filmer</HI> and his Di&s;ciples, who think that the power only is to be regarded, and not the means by which it is obtain'd. But tho it &s;hould be granted that a right had bin thus acquir'd, it mu&s;t accrue to the Nation, not to <HI>Hengi&s;t</HI> and <HI>Hor&s;a.</HI> If &s;uch an acqui&s;ition be call'd a Conque&s;t, the benefit mu&s;t belong to tho&s;e that conquer'd. This was not the work of two men; and tho&s;e who had bin free at home, can never be thought to have left their own Country, to fight as &s;laves for the glory and profit of two men in another. It cannot be &s;aid that their wants compel'd them, for their Leaders &s;uffer'd the &s;ame, and could not be reliev'd but by their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and whether their enterprize was good or bad, ju&s;t or unju&s;t, it was the &s;ame to all: No one man could have any right peculiar to him&s;elf, unle&s;s they who gain'd it, did confer it upon him: and 'tis no way probable, that they who in their own Country had kept their Princes within very narrow limits, as has bin prov'd, &s;hould re&s;ign them|&s;elves, and all they had, as &s;oon as they came hither. But we have al|ready &s;hewn that they always continu'd mo&s;t ob&s;tinate defenders of their Liberty, and the Government to which they had bin accu&s;tom'd; that they manag'd it by them&s;elves, and acknowledg'd no other Laws than their own. Nay, if they had made &s;uch a re&s;ignation of their Right, as was nece&s;&s;ary to create one in their Leaders, it would be enough to over|throw the propo&s;ition; for 'tis not then the Leader that gives to the Peo|ple, but the People to the Leader. If the people had not a right to give what they did give, none was confer'd upon the receiver: if they had a right, he that &s;hould pretend to derive a benefit from thence, mu&s;t prove the grant, that the nature and intention of it may appear.</P>
<P>2. To the &s;econd: If it be &s;aid that Records te&s;tify all Grants to have bin originally from the King; I an&s;wer, That tho it were con|fe&s;t, (which I ab&s;olutely deny, and affirm that our Rights and Li|bertys are innate, inherent, and enjoy'd time out of mind before we had Kings) it could be nothing to the que&s;tion, which is concerning Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice; and if they are wanting, the defect can never be &s;upply'd by any matter of fact, tho never &s;o clearly prov'd. Or if a Right be pretended to be grounded upon a matter of fact, the thing to be prov'd is, that the people did really confer &s;uch a right upon the fir&s;t, or &s;ome other Kings: And if no &s;uch thing do appear, the proceedings of one or more Kings as if they had it, can be of no value. But in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, no &s;uch grant is pretended to have bin made, either to the fir&s;t, or to any of the following Kings; the Right they had not, their Succe&s;&s;ors could not inherit, and con&s;e|quently cannot have it, or at mo&s;t no better title to it than that of U&s;urpation.</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="367">
But as they who inquire for truth ought not to deny or conceal any   thing, I may grant that Mannors, &amp;c. were enjoy'd by tenure from Kings; but that will no way prejudice the cau&s;e I defend, nor &s;ignify more than that the Countrys which the <HI>Saxons</HI> had acquir'd, were to be divided among them; and to avoid the quarrels that might ari&s;e, if every man took upon him to &s;eize what he could, a certain method of making the di&s;tribution was nece&s;&s;arily to be fix'd; and it was fit, that every man &s;hould have &s;omething in his own hands to ju&s;tify his Title to what he po&s;&s;e&s;t, according to which controver&s;ys &s;hould be determin'd. This mu&s;t be te&s;tify'd by &s;ome body, and no man could be &s;o fit, or of &s;o much credit as he who was chief among them; and this is no more than is u&s;ual in all the Societys of the World.

The Grants of our Kings are of the &s;ame nature, tho the words <HI>mero motu no&s;tro</HI> &s;eem to imply the contrary; for Kings &s;peak always in the plural number, to &s;hew that they do not act for them&s;elves, but for the Societys over which they are plac'd; and all the veneration that is, or can be given to their Acts, dos not exalt them, but tho&s;e from whom their Authority is deriv'd, and for whom they are to execute. The Tyrants of the Ea&s;t, and other Barbarians, who&s;e power is mo&s;t ab&s;olute, &s;peak in the &s;ingle number, as appears by the decrees of <HI>Nabu|chodono&s;or, Cyrus, Darius</HI> and <HI>Aha&s;uerus</HI> recited in Scripture, with others that we hear of daily from tho&s;e parts: but where&s;oever there is any thing of civility or regularity in Government, the Prince u&s;es the plural, to &s;hew that he acts in a publick capacity.

The que&s;tion is not whether &s;uch a one be ju&s;tly or unju&s;tly de|priv'd (for that concerns only tho&s;e who do it or &s;uffer it) but whether he can oblige the People; and 'tis ridiculous for any Nation to treat with a man that cannot perform what &s;hall be agreed, or for him to &s;tipulate that which can oblige, and will be made good only by him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But tho much may be left to the di&s;cretion of Kings in the di&s;tribution of Lands and the like, yet it no way dimini&s;hes the right of the People, nor confers any upon them otherwi&s;e to di&s;po&s;e of what belongs to the publick, than may tend to the common good, and the accompli&s;hment of tho&s;e ends for which they are intru&s;ted. Nay, if it were true, that a conquer'd Country did belong to the Crown, the King could not di&s;po&s;e of it, becau&s;e 'tis annex'd to the Office, add not alienable by the Per&s;on. This is not only found in regular mix'd Monarchys (as in <HI>Sweden,</HI> where the Grants made by the la&s;t Kings have bin lately re&s;cinded by the General A&s;&s;embly of E&s;tates, as contrary to Law) but even in the mo&s;t ab&s;olute,

<HEAD>SECT. XXX. <HI>Henry</HI> the Fir&s;t was King of <HI>England</HI> by as good a Title as any of his Predece&s;&s;ors or Succe&s;&s;ors.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING made it appear, as I &s;uppo&s;e, that the antient Nobility of <HI>England</HI> was compos'd of &s;uch men as had bin ennobl'd by bear|ing Arms in the defence or enlargement of the Commonwealth; that the Dukes, Earls, &amp;c. were tho&s;e who commanded them; that they and their dependents receiv'd Lands for &s;uch &s;ervices, under an obligation of continuing to render the like, and according to their &s;everal degrees and proportions, to provide and maintain Hor&s;es, Arms and Men for the &s;ame u&s;es; it cannot be deny'd that they were &s;uch Gentlemen and Lords of Mannors, as we now call Commoners, together with the Freehold|ers, and &s;uch as in war were found mo&s;t able to be their Leaders. Of the&s;e the Micklegemots, Wittenagemots, and other publick A&s;&s;emblys did con&s;i&s;t; and nothing can be more ab&s;urd than to a&s;&s;ign the names and rights of Duke, Earl and Vicount, which were names of Offices, to tho&s;e who have not the Offices, and are no way fit for them. If our Author therefore had &s;aid, that &s;uch as the&s;e, who had always com|pos'd the great Councils of our Nation, had in favour of <HI>Henry</HI> the Fir&s;t, be&s;tow'd the Crown upon him, as they had done upon his Father and Brother, I &s;hould agree with him: but 'tis the utmo&s;t extravagance to &s;ay, that he who had neither title nor po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;hould give the power to tho&s;e who had always bin in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and exercis'd it in giving to him what&s;oever he had. But I mo&s;t wonder he &s;hould &s;o far forget him&s;elf, to call this <HI>Henry</HI> a U&s;urper, and detract from the validity of his Acts, becau&s;e he had no title; whereas there neither is, was, or can be a U&s;urper if there be any truth in his Doctrin: for he plainly tells us, we are only to look to the power, and not at all to the means and ways by which it is obtain'd; and making no difference between a King and a Tyrant, enjoins an equal &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the commands of both. If this were only a &s;lip of his Pen, and he did really take this <HI>Henry</HI> to be a U&s;urper, becau&s;e he had not a good title, I &s;hould de&s;ire to know the marks by which a lawful King is di&s;tingui&s;h'd from an U&s;urper, and in what a ju&s;t Title dos con&s;i&s;t. If he place it in an hereditary Succe&s;&s;ion, we ought to be inform'd, whether this right mu&s;t be deduc'd from one univer&s;al Lord of Mankind, or from a particular Lord of every People: If from the univer&s;al Lord, the &s;ame de&s;cent that gives him a right to the dominion of any one Country, en&s;laves the whole world to him;
<PB N="361" REF="369">
if from the particular Lord of one place, proof mu&s;t be given how he   came to be &s;o: for if there was a defect in the fir&s;t, it can never be re|pair'd, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is no more than a continu'd U&s;urpation. But having already prov'd the ab&s;urdity of any pretence to either, I &s;hall for|bear the repetition, and only &s;ay, that if the cour&s;e of Succe&s;&s;ion may never be ju&s;tly interrupted, the Family of <HI>Meroveus</HI> could not have had any right to the Crown of <HI>France; Pepin</HI> was a U&s;urper, if it mu&s;t for ever have continu'd in the de&s;cendents of <HI>Meroveus,</HI> and <HI>Hugh Capet</HI> could have no title, if the Race of <HI>Pepin</HI> might not be di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;t. I leave our Author to di&s;pute this point with the King of <HI>France;</HI> and when he has &s;o far convinc'd him thathe is a U&s;urper, as to per&s;uade him to re&s;ign his Crown to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> claiming from <HI>Pharamond,</HI> or to that of <HI>Lorrain</HI> as de&s;cended from <HI>Pepin,</HI> I can give him half a dozen more knots which will not be with le&s;s difficulty unty'd, and which in&s;tead of e&s;tabli&s;hing the Titles of &s;uch Kings as are known to us, will overthrow them all, unle&s;s a Right be given to U&s;urpation, or the con&s;ent of a People do confer it.</P>
<P>But if there be &s;uch a thing as a U&s;urper, and a Rule by which men may judg of U&s;urpation, 'tis not only lawful but nece&s;&s;ary to examin the Titles of &s;uch as go under the name of Kings, that we may know whether they are truly &s;o or not, le&s;t thro ignorance we chance to give the Veneration and Obedience that is due to a King, to one who is not a King, and deny it to him, who by an uninterruptible Line of De&s;cent is our natural Lord; and thereby prefer the wor&s;t of men and our mo&s;t bitter enemy before the Per&s;on we ought to look upon as our Father: and if this prove dangerous to one or more Kings, 'tis our Author's fault, not mine.</P>
<P>If there be no U&s;urper, nor Rule of di&s;tingui&s;hing him from a lawful Prince, <HI>Filmer</HI> is the wor&s;t of all triflers and impo&s;tors, who grounds his Arguments in the mo&s;t &s;erious matters upon what he e&s;teems to be fal&s;e; but the truth is, he &s;eems to have &s;et him&s;elf again&s;t humanity and com|mon &s;en&s;e, as much as again&s;t Law and Vertue: and if he who &s;o fre|quently contradicts him&s;elf, can be &s;aid to mean any thing, he would au|thorize rapine and murder, and per&s;uade us to account tho&s;e to be right|ful Kings, who by treachery and other unju&s;t means overthrow the right of De&s;cent which he pretends to e&s;teem &s;acred, as well as the Li|bertys of Nations, which by better Judges are thought to be &s;o; and gives the odious name of U&s;urpation to the Advancement of one who is made King by the con&s;ent of a willing People.</P>
<P>But if <HI>Henry</HI> the Fir&s;t were a U&s;urper, I de&s;ire to know whether the &s;ame name belongs to all our Kings, or which of them de&s;erves a better; that we may under&s;tand who&s;e acts ought to be reputed legal, and to who&s;e De&s;cent we owe veneration, or whether we are wholly exempted from all: for I cannot &s;ee a po&s;&s;ibility of fixing the guilt of U&s;urpation upon <HI>Henry</HI> the Fir&s;t, without involving many, if not all our Kings in the &s;ame.</P>
<P>If his Title was not good becau&s;e his Brother <HI>Robert</HI> was &s;till living, that of <HI>Rufus</HI> is by the &s;ame rea&s;on overthrown; and <HI>William</HI> their Fa|ther being a ba&s;tard could have none. This fundamental defect could never be repair'd: &s;or the Succe&s;&s;ors could inherit no more than the right of the fir&s;t, which was nothing. <HI>Stephen</HI> could deduce no Title either from <HI>Norman</HI> or <HI>Saxon;</HI> what&s;oever <HI>Henry</HI> the Second pretended, mu&s;t be from his Mother <HI>Maud,</HI> and any other might have bin pre&s;er'd before her as well as he. If her Title was from the <HI>Normans,</HI> it mu&s;t be void,
<PB N="362" REF="370">
  &s;ince they had none, and the &s;tory of <HI>Edgar Atheling</HI> is too impertinent to de&s;erve mention. But however, it could be of no advantage to her; for <HI>David</HI> King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Brother to her Mother from whom only her Title could be deriv'd, was then alive with his Son <HI>Henry,</HI> who dying not long after, left three Sons and three Daughters, who&s;e po&s;terity be|ing di&s;tributed into many Familys of <HI>Scotland,</HI> remains to this day; and if proximity of blood is to be con&s;ider'd, ought always to have bin pre|fer'd before her and her De&s;cendents, unle&s;s there be a Law that gives the preference to Daughters before Sons. What right &s;oever <HI>Henry</HI> the Second had, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have peri&s;h'd with him, all his Children having bin begotten in manife&s;t Adultery on <HI>Eleanor</HI> of <HI>Ga&s;cony,</HI> during the life of <HI>Lewis</HI> King of <HI>France</HI> her fir&s;t Husband: and nothing could be alledg'd to color the bu&s;ine&s;s, but a Di&s;pen&s;ation from the Pope directly again&s;t the Law of God, and the words of our Saviour, who &s;ays, <HI>That a Wife cannot be put away unle&s;s for Adultery, and he that marrys her that is put away commits Adultery.</HI> The pollution of this &s;pring is not to be cur'd; but tho it &s;hould pa&s;s unregarded, no one part of the Succe&s;&s;ion &s;ince that time has remain'd intire. <HI>John</HI> was prefer'd before <HI>Arthur</HI> his elder Bro|ther's Son: <HI>Edward</HI> the Third was made King by the depo&s;ition of his Father: <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth by that of <HI>Richard</HI> the Second. If the Hou&s;e of <HI>Mortimer</HI> or <HI>York</HI> had the right, <HI>Henry</HI> the 4<HI>th,</HI> 5<HI>th,</HI> and 6<HI>th</HI> were not Kings, and all who claim under them have no Title. However, <HI>Richard</HI> the Third could have none; for the Children of his elder Brother the Duke of <HI>Clarence</HI> were then living. The Children of <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth may be &s;u&s;pected of Ba&s;tardy; and tho it may have bin otherwi&s;e, yet that matter is not &s;o clear as things of &s;uch importance ought to be, and the con&s;equence may reach very far. But tho that &s;cruple were remov'd, 'tis certain that <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh was not King in the right of his Wife <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> for he reign'd before and after her; and for his other Titles, we <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mem. de Commin.</NOTE>may believe <HI>Philip de Commines,</HI> who &s;ays, <HI>He had neither cro&s;s nor pile.</HI> If <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth had a right in him&s;elf, or from his Mother, he &s;hould have reign'd immediately after her death, which he never pre|tended, nor to &s;ucceed till his Father was dead, thereby acknowledging he had no right but from him, unle&s;s the Parliament and People can give it. The like may be &s;aid of his Children. <HI>Mary</HI> could have no Title if &s;he was a Ba&s;tard, begotten in Ince&s;t; but if her Mother's Marriage was good and &s;he legitimate, <HI>Elizabeth</HI> could have none.</P>
<P>Yet all the&s;e were lawful Kings and Queens; their Acts continue in force to this day to all intents and purpo&s;es: the Parliament and People made them to be &s;o, when they had no other Title. The Parliament and People therefore have the power of making Kings: Tho&s;e who are &s;o made are not U&s;urpers: We have had none but &s;uch for more than &s;even hundred years. They were therefore lawful Kings, or this Na|tion has had none in all that time; and if our Author like this conclu&s;ion, the account from whence it is drawn may without difficulty be carry'd as high as our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hi&s;torys do reach.</P>
<P>This being built upon the &s;teddy Foundation of Law, Hi&s;tory and Rea&s;on, is not to be remov'd by any Man's opinion; e&s;pecially by one ac|company'd with &s;uch circum&s;tances as Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> was in during the la&s;t years of his life: And there is &s;omething of ba&s;ene&s;s, as well as prevarication, in turning the words of an eminent Per&s;on, reduc'd to great difficultys, to a &s;en&s;e no way agreeing with his former Actions or Writ|ings, and no le&s;s tending to impair his Reputation than to deceive others.
<PB N="363" REF="371">

<P>A Perverted Judgment always leads men into a wrong way, and per|&s;uades them to believe that tho&s;e things favor their cau&s;e, that ut|terly overthrow it. For a proof of this, I de&s;ire our Author's words may be con&s;ider'd. <HI>In the former Parliaments,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>in&s;tituted and continu'd &s;ince</HI> Henry <HI>the First his time, is not to be found the u&s;age of any natural Li|berty of the People: For all tho&s;e Libertys that are claim'd in Parliament, are Libertys of Grace from the King, and not the Libertys of Nature to the People: For if the Liberty were natural, it would give power to the multitude to a&s;|&s;emble them&s;elves, when and where they pleas'd, to be&s;tow the Sovereignty, and by pactions to limit and direct the exerci&s;e of it.</HI> And I &s;ay that Nations be|ing naturally free, may meet, when and where they plea&s;e; may di&s;|po&s;e of the Sovereignty, and may direct or limit the exerci&s;e of it, unle&s;s by their own Act they have depriv'd them&s;elves of that Right: and there could never have bin a lawful A&s;&s;embly of any People in the World, if they had not had that Power in them&s;elves. It was prov'd in the prece|ding Section, that all our Kings having no Title, were no more than what the Nobility and People made them to be; that they could have no Power but what was given to them, and could confer none except what they had receiv'd. If they can therefore call Parliaments, the power of calling them mu&s;t have bin given to them, and could not be given by any who had it not in them&s;elves. The <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> met together, and cho&s;e <HI>Ehud, Gideon, Samp&s;on, Jephtha,</HI> and others, to be their Leaders, whom they judg'd fit
<PB N="364" REF="372">
  to deliver them from their Enemys. By the &s;ame right they a&s;&s;embl'd at <HI>Mi&s;peth</HI> to make War again&s;t the Tribe of <HI>Benjamin,</HI> when Ju&s;tice was deny'd to be done again&s;t tho&s;e who had villanou&s;ly abus'd the Levite's Concubine. In the like manner they would have made <HI>Gideon</HI> King, but he refus'd. In the &s;ame place they met, and cho&s;e <HI>Saul</HI> to be their King. He being dead, the men of <HI>Judah</HI> a&s;&s;embl'd them&s;elves, and anointed <HI>Da|vid:</HI> not long after, all the Tribes met at <HI>Hebron,</HI> made a Contract with him, and receiv'd him as their King. In the &s;ame manner, tho by wor&s;e Coun&s;el, they made <HI>Ab&s;alom</HI> King. And the like was attempted in favor of <HI>Sheba</HI> the Son of <HI>Bichri,</HI> tho they then had a King cho&s;en by them&s;elves. When they found them&s;elves oppre&s;t by the Tributes that had bin laid upon them by <HI>Solomon,</HI> they met at <HI>Shechem;</HI> and being di&s;pleas'd with <HI>Rehoboam</HI>'s an&s;wer to their complaints, ten of the Tribes made <HI>Jeroboam</HI> King. <HI>Jehu,</HI> and all the other Kings of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> whether good or bad, had no other Title than was confer'd upon them by the prevailing part of the People; which could not have given them any, unle&s;s they had met to|gether; nor meet together without the con&s;ent, and again&s;t the will of tho&s;e that reign'd, unle&s;s the Power had bin in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Where Governments are more exactly regulated, the Power of judging when 'tis fit to call the Senat or People together, is refer'd to one or more Magi&s;trats; as in <HI>Rome</HI> to the Con&s;uls or Tribuns, in <HI>Athens</HI> to the Archons, and in <HI>Thebes</HI> to the Beotarches: but none of them could have the&s;e Pow|ers, unle&s;s they had bin given by tho&s;e who advanc'd them to the Ma|gi&s;tracys to which they were annex'd; nor could they have bin &s;o an|nex'd, if tho&s;e who created them had not had the right in them&s;elves. If they Officers neglected their duty of calling &s;uch A&s;&s;emblys when the publick Affairs requir'd, the People met by their own Authority, and pu|ni&s;h'd the Per&s;on, or abrogated the Magi&s;tracy, as appears in the ca&s;e of the <HI>Decemviri,</HI> and many others that might be alledg'd, if the thing were not &s;o plain as to need no further proof. The rea&s;on of this is, that they who in&s;titute a Magi&s;tracy, be&s;t know whether the end of the In&s;titution be rightly pur&s;u'd or not: And all ju&s;t Magi&s;tracys being the &s;ame in e&s;|&s;ence, tho differing in form, the &s;ame right mu&s;t perpetually belong to tho&s;e who put the Sovereign Power into the hands of one, a few, or many men, which is what our Author calls the Di&s;po&s;al of the Sovereign|ty. Thus the <HI>Romans</HI> did when they created Kings, Con&s;uls, Military Tribuns, Dictators, or <HI>Decemviri:</HI> and it had bin mo&s;t ridiculous to &s;ay, that tho&s;e Officers gave authority to the People to meet and chu&s;e them; for they who are cho&s;en are the Creatures of tho&s;e who chu&s;e, and are nothing more than others till they are cho&s;en. The la&s;t King of <HI>Sweden, Charles Gu&s;tavus,</HI> told a Gentleman who was Emba&s;&s;ador there, That the <HI>Swedes</HI> having made him King, when he was poor and had nothing in the World, he had but one work to do, which was &s;o to reign, that they might never repent the good opinion they had conceiv'd of him. They might therefore meet, and did meet to con&s;er the Sovereignty upon him, or he could never have had it: For tho the Kingdom be hereditary to Males or Females, and his Mother was Si&s;ter to the Great <HI>Gu&s;tavus;</HI> yet having marry'd a &s;tranger without the con&s;ent of the E&s;tates, &s;he per|form'd not the Condition upon which Women are admitted to the Succe&s;|&s;ion; and thereby falling from her Right, he pretended not to any. The Act of his Election declares he had none, and gives the Crown to him and the Heirs of his Body, with this farther Declaration, that the benefit of his Election &s;hould no way extend to his Brother Prince <HI>Adolphus;</HI> and
<PB N="365" REF="373">
'tis confe&s;t by all the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Nation, that if the King now reigning &s;hould   die without Children, the E&s;tates would proceed to a new Election.</P>
<P>'Tis rightly ob&s;erv'd by our Author, that if the People might meet and give the Sovereign Power, they might al&s;o direct and limit it; for they did meet in this and other Countrys, they did confer the Sovereign Pow|er, they did limit and direct the exerci&s;e; and the Laws of each People &s;hew in what manner and mea&s;ure it is every where done. This is as cer|tain in relation to Kings, as any other Magi&s;trats. The Commi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Roman</HI> Dictators was, to take care <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ne quid detrimenti Re&s;publica accipiat. <BIBL>T.

This power of conferring the Sovereignty was exercis'd in <HI>France</HI> by tho&s;e who made <HI>Meroveus</HI> King, in the prejudice of the two Grandchildren of <HI>Pharamond,</HI> Sons to <HI>Clodion;</HI> by tho&s;e who excluded his Race, and gave the Crown to <HI>Pepin;</HI> by tho&s;e who depos'd <HI>Lewis le Debonair,</HI> and <HI>Charles le Gro&s;s;</HI> by tho&s;e who brought in five Kings, that were either Ba&s;tards or Strangers, between him and <HI>Charles le Simple;</HI> by tho&s;e who rejected his Race, and advanc'd <HI>Hugh Capet;</HI> by tho&s;e who made <HI>Henry</HI> the Fir&s;t King, to the prejudice of <HI>Robert</HI> his elder Brother, and continu'd the Crown in the Race of <HI>Henry</HI> for ten Generations, whil&s;t the De&s;cendents of <HI>Robert</HI> were only Dukes of <HI>Burgundy.</HI> The like was done in <HI>Ca&s;tille</HI> and <HI>Arragon,</HI> by frequently preferring the younger before the elder Brother; the De&s;cendents of Fe|males before tho&s;e of the Male-line in the &s;ame degree; the more remote in Blood before the neare&s;t; and &s;ometimes Ba&s;tards before the legitimate I&s;&s;ue. The &s;ame was done in <HI>England</HI> in relation to every King, &s;ince the coming in of the <HI>Normans,</HI> as I &s;hew'd in the la&s;t Section, and other pla|ces of this Work.</P>
<P>That they who gave the Sovereignty, might al&s;o circum&s;cribe and di|rect it, is manife&s;t by the &s;everal ways of providing for the Succe&s;&s;ion in|&s;tituted by &s;everal Nations. Some are merely elective, as the Empire of <HI>Germany</HI> and the Kingdom of <HI>Poland</HI> to this day; the Kingdom of <HI>Den|mark</HI> till the year 1660; that of <HI>Sweden</HI> till the time of <HI>Gu&s;tavus Eric&s;on,</HI> who deliver'd that Nation from the oppre&s;&s;ion of <HI>Chri&s;tern</HI> II. the cruel King of the <HI>Danes.</HI> In others the Election was confin'd to one or more Fa|milys, as the Kingdom of the <HI>Goths</HI> in <HI>Spain</HI> to the <HI>Balthei</HI> and <HI>Amalthei.</HI> In &s;ome, the elde&s;t Man of the reigning Family was prefer'd before the neare&s;t, as in <HI>Scotland</HI> before the time of <HI>Kennethus.</HI> In other places the neare&s;t in Blood is prefer'd before the elder if more remote. In &s;ome, no regard is had to Females, or their De&s;cendents, as in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Turky:</HI> in others, they or their De&s;cendents are admitted, either &s;imply as well as Males; or under a condition of marrying in the Country, or with the con&s;ent of the E&s;tates, as in <HI>Sweden.</HI> And no other rea&s;on can be given for this almo&s;t infinite variety of Con&s;titutions, than that they who made
<PB N="366" REF="374">
  them would have it &s;o; which could not be, if God and Nature had ap|pointed one General Rule for all Nations. For in that ca&s;e, the Kingdom of <HI>France</HI> mu&s;t be elective, as well as that of <HI>Poland</HI> and the Empire; or the Empire and <HI>Poland</HI> hereditary, as that of <HI>France:</HI> Daughters mu&s;t &s;ucceed in <HI>France,</HI> as well as in <HI>England,</HI> or be excluded in <HI>England</HI> as in <HI>France;</HI> and he that would e&s;tabli&s;h one as the Ordinance of God and Na|ture, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity overthrow all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>A farther exerci&s;e of the natural Liberty of Nations is di&s;cover'd in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">De jur. bel. &amp; pac.</NOTE>&s;everal Limitations put upon the Sovereign Power. Some Kings, &s;ays <HI>Grotius,</HI> have the <HI>Summum Imperium &s;ummo modo;</HI> others, <HI>modo non &s;um|mo:</HI> and among&s;t tho&s;e that are under Limitations, the degrees as to more or le&s;s, are almo&s;t infinite, as I have prov'd already by the example of <HI>Ar|ragon,</HI> antient <HI>Germany,</HI> the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings, the <HI>Normans,</HI> the Kings of <HI>Ca|&s;tille,</HI> the pre&s;ent Empire, with divers others. And I may &s;afely &s;ay, that the antient Government of <HI>France</HI> was much of the &s;ame nature to the time of <HI>Charles</HI> the 7<HI>th,</HI> and <HI>Lewis</HI> the 11<HI>th:</HI> but the work of emancipating them&s;elves, as they call it, begun by them, is now brought to perfection in a boundle&s;s elevation of the King's Greatne&s;s and Riches, to the un|&s;peakable mi&s;ery of the People.</P>
<P>'Twere a folly to think this Variety proceeds from the Conce&s;&s;ions of Kings, who naturally delight in Power, and hate that which cro&s;&s;es their Will. It might with more rea&s;on be imagin'd, that the <HI>Roman</HI> Con&s;uls, who were brought up in liberty, who had contracted a love to their Country, and were contented to live upon an equal foot with their fellow Citizens, &s;hould confine the Power of their Magi&s;tracy to a year; or that the Dukes of <HI>Venice</HI> &s;hould be graciou&s;ly pleas'd to give power to the <HI>Coun|cil of Ten</HI> to puni&s;h them capitally if they tran&s;gre&s;t the Laws, than that Kings &s;hould put &s;uch Fetters upon their Power, which they &s;o much ab|hor; or that they would &s;uffer them, if they could be ea&s;ily broken. If any one of them &s;hould prove &s;o moderate, like <HI>Trajan,</HI> to command the Pre|fect of the Pretorian Guard to u&s;e the Sword for him if he govern'd well, and again&s;t him if he did not, it would &s;oon be re&s;cinded by his Succe&s;&s;or; the Law which has no other &s;trength than the act of one man, may be an|nul'd by another. So that nothing dos more certainly prove, that the Laws made in &s;everal Countrys to re&s;train the Power of Kings, and va|riou&s;ly to di&s;po&s;e of the Succe&s;&s;ion, are not from them, than the frequent examples of their fury, who have expos'd them&s;elves to the greate&s;t dan|gers, and brought infinite mi&s;erys upon the People, thro the de&s;ire of break|ing them. It mu&s;t therefore be concluded, that Nations have power of meeting together, and of conferring, limiting, and directing the Sovereignty; or all mu&s;t be grounded upon mo&s;t manife&s;t Inju&s;tice and U&s;urpation.</P>
<P>No man can have a power over a Nation otherwi&s;e than <HI>de jure,</HI> or <HI>de facto.</HI> He who pretends to have a power <HI>de jure,</HI> mu&s;t prove that it is originally inherent in him or his predece&s;&s;or from whom he inherits; or that it was ju&s;tly acquir'd by him. The vanity of any pretence to an ori|ginal Right appears &s;ufficiently, I hope, from the proofs already given, that the fir&s;t Fathers of Mankind had it not; or if they had, no man could now inherit the &s;ame, there being no man able to make good the Genea|logy that &s;hould give him a right to the Succe&s;&s;ion. Be&s;ides, the facility we have of proving the beginnings of all the Familys that reign among us, makes it as ab&s;urd for any of them to pretend a perpetual right to Domi|nion, as for any Citizen of <HI>London,</HI> who&s;e Parents and Birth we know, to &s;ay he is the very man <HI>Noah,</HI> who liv'd in the time of the Flood, and is now four or five thou&s;and years old.</P>
<P><PB N="367" REF="375">
If the power were confer'd on him or his Predece&s;&s;ors, 'tis what we   ask; for the Collation can be of no value, unle&s;s made by tho&s;e who had a right to do it; and the original Right by De&s;cent failing, no one can have any over a Free People but them&s;elves, or tho&s;e to whom they have given it.</P>
<P>If Acqui&s;ition be pretended, 'tis the &s;ame thing; for there can be no right to that which is acquir'd, unle&s;s the right of invading be prov'd; and that being done, nothing can be acquir'd except what belong'd to the Per&s;on that was invaded, and that only by him who had the right of in|vading. No man ever did or could conquer a Nation by his own &s;trength; no man therefore could ever acquire a per&s;onal right over any; and if it was confer'd upon him by tho&s;e who made the Conque&s;t with him, they were the People that did it. He can no more be &s;aid to have the Right ori|ginally in and from him&s;elf, than a Magi&s;trate of <HI>Rome</HI> or <HI>Athens</HI> imme|diately after his Creation; and having no other at the beginning, he can have none to eternity; for the Nature of it mu&s;t refer to the Original, and cannot be chang'd by time.</P>
<P>What&s;oever therefore proceeds not from the con&s;ent of the People, mu&s;t be <HI>de facto</HI> only, that is void of all right; and 'tis impo&s;&s;ible there &s;hould not be a right of de&s;troying that which is grounded upon none; and by the &s;ame rule that one man enjoys what he gain'd by violence, another may take it from him. <HI>Cyrus</HI> overthrew the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians</HI> and <HI>Babylonians, Alexander</HI> the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians;</HI> and if they had no right of making war upon tho&s;e Nations, the Nations could not but have a right of recovering all that had bin unju&s;tly taken from them, and avenging the evils they had &s;uffer'd. If the cau&s;e of the war was originally ju&s;t, and not corrupted by an intemperate u&s;e of the victory, the conquer'd People was per|haps oblig'd to be quiet; but the conquering Armys that confer'd upon their Generals what they had taken from their Enemys, might as ju&s;tly expect an account of what they had given, and that it &s;hould be imploy'd according to the intention of the givers, as the People of any City might do from their regularly created Magi&s;trats; becau&s;e it was as impo&s;&s;ible for <HI>Cyrus, Alexander</HI> or <HI>Ce&s;ar,</HI> to gain a power over the Armys they led, without their con&s;ent, as for <HI>Pericles, Valerius,</HI> or any other di&s;arm'd Ci|tizen to gain more power in their re&s;pective Citys, than was voluntarily confer'd upon them. And I know no other difference between Kingdoms &s;o con&s;tituted by conquering Armys, and &s;uch as are e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the mo&s;t orderly manner, than that the fir&s;t u&s;ually incline more to War, the latter to Ju&s;tice and Peace. But there have not bin wanting many of the fir&s;t &s;ort (e&s;pecially the Nations coming from the North) who were no le&s;s exact in ordaining that which tended to the pre&s;ervation of Liberty, nor le&s;s &s;evere in &s;eeing it punctually perform'd, than the mo&s;t regular Com|monwealths that ever were in the World. And it can with no more rea|&s;on be pretended, that the <HI>Goths</HI> receiv'd their Privileges from <HI>Alan</HI> or <HI>Theodoric,</HI> the <HI>Francs</HI> from <HI>Pharamond</HI> or <HI>Meroveus,</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> from <HI>Ina</HI> or <HI>Ethelred,</HI> than that the Liberty of <HI>Athens</HI> was the gift of <HI>Themi&s;to|cles</HI> or <HI>Pericles,</HI> that the Empire of <HI>Rome</HI> proceeded from the liberality of <HI>Brutus</HI> or <HI>Valerius,</HI> and that the Commonwealth of <HI>Venice</HI> at this day &s;ub|&s;i&s;ts by the favor of the <HI>Contarini</HI> or <HI>More&s;ini:</HI> which mu&s;t reduce us to matter of Right, &s;ince that of Fact void of Right can &s;ignify nothing.</P>

<HEAD>  SECT. XXXII. The Powers of Kings are &s;o various according to the Con&s;titutions of &s;everal States, that no Con&s;equence can be drawn to the prejudice or advantage of any one, merely from the Name.</HEAD>
<P>IN oppo&s;ition to what is above &s;aid, &s;ome alledg the name of <HI>King,</HI> as if there were a charm in the word; and our Author &s;eems to put more weight upon it, than in the Rea&s;ons he brings to &s;upport his Cau&s;e. But that we may &s;ee there is no efficacy in it, and that it conveys no other right than what particular Nations may annex to it, we are to con&s;ider,</P>
<P>1. That the mo&s;t ab&s;olute Princes that are or have bin in the World, never had the name of King: whereas it has bin frequently given to tho&s;e who&s;e powers have bin very much re&s;train'd. The <HI>Ce&s;ars</HI> were never call'd Kings, till the &s;ixth Age of Chri&s;tianity: the Califs and Soldan of <HI>Egypt</HI> and <HI>Babylon,</HI> the Great <HI>Turk,</HI> the Cham of <HI>Tartary,</HI> or the Great <HI>Mogol</HI> never took that name, nor any other of the &s;ame &s;ignification. The <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mo&s;covy</HI> has it not, tho he is as ab&s;olute a Monarch, and his People as mi&s;erable &s;laves as any in the World. On the other &s;ide, the chief Ma|gi&s;trats of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Athens</HI> for &s;ome time, tho&s;e of <HI>Sparta, Arragon, Sweden, Denmark</HI> and <HI>England, who could do nothing but by Law,</HI> have bin call'd Kings. This may be enough to &s;hew, that a Name being no way e&s;&s;en|tial, what Title &s;oever is given to the Chief Magi&s;trate, he can have no other power than the Laws and Cu&s;toms of his Country do give, or the People confer upon him.</P>
<P>2. The names of Magi&s;trats are often chang'd, tho the power continue to be the &s;ame; and the powers are &s;ometimes alter'd tho the name re|main. When <HI>Octavius Ce&s;ar</HI> by the force of a mad corrupted Soldiery had overthrown all Law and Right, he took no other Title in relation to Mi|litary Affairs than that of <HI>Imperator,</HI> which in the time of Liberty was by the Armys often given to Pretors and Con&s;uls: In Civil matters he was, as he pretended, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> unitia pote&s;tate contentus. <BIBL>C. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">it.</BIBL></NOTE>content with the power of Tribun; and the like was ob&s;erv'd in his Succe&s;&s;or, who to new invented U&s;urpations, <HI>gave old and approv'd names.</HI> On the other &s;ide, tho&s;e Titles which have bin render'd odious and execrable by the violent exerci&s;e of an ab&s;olute Power, are &s;ometimes made popular by moderate limitations; as in <HI>Germany,</HI> where, tho the Monarchy &s;eem to be as well temper'd as any, the Princes retain the &s;ame names of <HI>Imperator, Ce&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> as tho&s;e had done, who by the exce&s;s of their rage and fury had de&s;olated and corrupted the be&s;t part of the World.</P>
<P>Sometimes the name is chang'd, tho the power in all re&s;pects continue <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">vedra. M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">na. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE>the &s;ame. The Lords of <HI>Ca&s;tille</HI> had for many Ages no other Title than that of Count; and when the Nobility and People thought good, they chang'd it to that of King, without any addition to the power.</P>
<P>The Sovereign Magi&s;trat in <HI>Poland</HI> was call'd Duke till within the la&s;t two hundred years, when they gave the title of King to one of the <HI>Jagellan</HI> Family; which title has continu'd to this day, tho without any change in the nature of the Magi&s;tracy. And I pre&s;ume, no wi&s;e man will think, that if the <HI>Venetians</HI> &s;hould give the name of King to their Duke, it could
<PB N="369" REF="377">
confer any other power upon him than he has already, unle&s;s more &s;hould   be confer'd by the Authority of the <HI>Great Council.</HI></P>
<P>3. The &s;ame names which in &s;ome places denote the Supreme Magi|&s;tracy, in others are &s;ubordinate or merely titular. In <HI>England, France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> Dukes and Earls are Subjects: in <HI>Germany</HI> the Electors and &s;ome Princes who are call'd by tho&s;e names, are little le&s;s than Sovereigns; and the Dukes of <HI>Savoy, Tu&s;cany, Mo&s;covy</HI> and others, acknowledg no Superior, as well as tho&s;e of <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;tille</HI> had none, when they went under tho&s;e titles. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of Kings. Some are &s;ubject to a foreign power, as divers of them were &s;ubject to the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> and <HI>Babylonian</HI> Mo|narchs, who for that rea&s;on were call'd the Kings of Kings. Some al&s;o are tributarys; and when the <HI>Spaniards</HI> fir&s;t landed in <HI>America,</HI> the great Kings of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru</HI> had many others under them. Three&s;core and ten Kings gather'd up meat under the Table of <HI>Adonibezek.</HI> The <HI>Romans</HI> had many Kings depending upon them. <HI>Herod</HI> and tho&s;e of his Race were of this number; and the di&s;pute between him and his Sons <HI>Ari&s;tobulus</HI> and <HI>A|lexander,</HI> was to be determin'd by them; neither dur&s;t he decide the matter till it was refer'd to him. But a right of Appeal did &s;till remain, as appears by the ca&s;e of St. <HI>Paul</HI> when <HI>Agrippa</HI> was King. The Kings of <HI>Mauritania</HI> from the time of <HI>Ma&s;&s;ini&s;&s;a,</HI> were under the like dependence: <HI>Jugurtha</HI> went to <HI>Rome</HI> to ju&s;tify him&s;elf for the death of <HI>Micip&s;a: Juba</HI> was command|ed by the <HI>Roman</HI> Magi&s;trats, <HI>Scipio, Petreius</HI> and <HI>Afranius;</HI> another <HI>Juba</HI> was made King of the &s;ame Country by <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> and <HI>Tiridates</HI> of <HI>Armenia</HI> by <HI>Nero;</HI> and infinite examples of this nature may be alledg'd. Moreover, their powers are variou&s;ly regulated, according to the variety of tempers in Nations and Ages. Some have re&s;train'd the powers that by experience were found to be exorbitant; others have di&s;&s;olv'd the bonds that were laid upon them: and Laws relating to the In&s;titution, Abrogation, Enlarge|ment or Re&s;triction of the Regal Power, would be utterly in&s;ignificant if this could not be done. But &s;uch Laws are of no effect in any other Coun|try than where they are made. The lives of the <HI>Spartans</HI> did not depend upon the will of <HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI> or <HI>Leonidas,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>Nabuchodono&s;or</HI> could kill or &s;ave whom he pleas'd: and tho the King of <HI>Marocco</HI> may &s;tab his Sub|jects, throw them to the Lions, or hang them upon tenterhooks; yet a King of <HI>Poland</HI> would probably be call'd to a &s;evere account, if he &s;hould unju&s;tly kill a &s;ingle man.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXXIII. The Liberty of a People is the Gift of God and Nature.</HEAD>
<P>IF any man ask how Nations come to have the power of doing the&s;e things, I an&s;wer, That Liberty being only an exemption from the dominion of another, the que&s;tion ought not to be, how a Nation can come to be free, but how a man comes to have a dominion over it; for till the right of Dominion be prov'd and ju&s;tify'd, Liberty &s;ub&s;i&s;ts as ari&s;ing from the Nature and Being of a man. <HI>Tertullian</HI> &s;peaking of the Emperors &s;ays, <HI>Ab eo Imperium &agrave; quo &s;piritus;</HI> and we taking man in his fir&s;t condition may ju&s;tly &s;ay, <HI>ab eo Libertas &agrave; quo &s;piritus;</HI> for no man can owe more than he has receiv'd. The Creature having nothing, and being nothing but what the Creator makes him, mu&s;t owe all to him, and nothing to any one from whom he has receiv'd nothing. Man there|fore
<PB N="370" REF="378">
  mu&s;t be naturally free, unle&s;s he be created by another power than we have yet heard of. The obedience due to Parents ari&s;es from hence, in that they are the in&s;truments of our Generation; and we are in&s;tructed by the light of Rea&s;on, that we ought to make great returns to tho&s;e from whom under God we have receiv'd all. When they die we are their Heirs, we enjoy the &s;ame rights, and devolve the &s;ame to our Po&s;terity. God only, who con|fers this right upon us, can deprive us of it: and we can no way under&s;tand he dos &s;o, unle&s;s he had &s;o declar'd by expre&s;s Revelation, or had &s;et &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hing marks of Dominion and Subjection upon men; and, as an ingenious Per&s;on not long &s;ince &s;aid, caus'd &s;ome to be born with Crowns on their heads, and all others with Saddles upon their backs. This Liberty therefore mu&s;t continue, till it be either forfeited or willingly re&s;ign'd. The forfeiture is hardly comprehen&s;ible in a multitude that is not enter'd into any Society; for as they are all equal, and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Par in parem non habet imperium.</NOTE><HI>equals can have no right over each other,</HI> no man can forfeit any thing to one who can ju&s;tly demand nothing, unle&s;s it may be by a per&s;onal injury, which is nothing to this ca&s;e; be|cau&s;e where there is no Society, one man is not bound by the actions of an|other. All cannot join in the &s;ame Act, becau&s;e they are join'd in none; or if they &s;hould, no man could recover, much le&s;s tran&s;mit the forfeiture; and not being tran&s;mitted, it peri&s;hes as if it had never bin, and no man can claim any thing from it.</P>
<P>'Twill be no le&s;s difficult to bring re&s;ignation to be &s;ub&s;ervient to our Author's purpo&s;e; for men could not re&s;ign their Liberty, unle&s;s they naturally had it in them&s;elves. Re&s;ignation is a publick declaration of their a&s;&s;ent to be govern'd by the Per&s;on to whom they re&s;ign; that is, they do by that Act con&s;titute him to be their Governor. This nece&s;&s;a|rily puts us upon the inquiry, Why they do re&s;ign, how they will be go|vern'd, and proves the Governor to be their creature; and the right of di&s;|po&s;ing the Government mu&s;t be in them, or they who receive it can have none. This is &s;o evident to common &s;en&s;e, that it were impertinent to ask who made <HI>Carthage, Athens, Rome</HI> or <HI>Venice</HI> to be free Citys. Their Charters were not from men, but from God and Nature. When a number of <HI>Phenicians</HI> had found a Port on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> they might perhaps agree with the Inhabitants for a parcel of Ground, but they brought their Liberty with them. When a company of <HI>Latins, Sabins</HI> and <HI>Tu&s;cans</HI> met together upon the Banks of the <HI>Tiber,</HI> and cho&s;e rather to build a City for them&s;elves, than to live in &s;uch as were adjacent, they carry'd their Liberty in their own Brea&s;ts, and had Hands and Swords to defend it. This was their Charter; and <HI>Romulus</HI> could confer no more upon them, than <HI>Dido</HI> upon the <HI>Carthaginians.</HI> When a multitude of barbarous Na|tions infe&s;ted <HI>Italy,</HI> and no protection could be expected from the corrup|ted and peri&s;hing Empire, &s;uch as agreed to &s;eek a place of refuge in the &s;catter'd I&s;lands of the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Gulf, had no need of any man's Au|thority to ratify the In&s;titution of their Government. They who were the formal part of the City, and had built the material, could not but have a right of governing as they pleas'd, &s;ince if they did ami&s;s, the hurt was only to them&s;elves. 'Tis probable enough that &s;ome of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, as Lords of the Soil, might have pretended to a Do|minion over them, if there had bin any color for it: but nothing of that kind appearing in thirteen hundred years, we are not like to hear of any
<PB N="371" REF="379">
&s;uch cavils. 'Tis agreed by Mankind, that &s;ubjection and protection are   relative; and that he who cannot protect tho&s;e that are under him, in vain pretends to a Dominion over them. The only ends for which Go|vernments are con&s;tituted, and obedience render'd to them, are the ob|taining of Ju&s;tice and Protection; and they who cannot provide for both, give the People a right of taking &s;uch ways as be&s;t plea&s;e them&s;elves, in or|der to their own &s;afety.</P>
<P>The matter is yet more clear in relation to tho&s;e who never were in any Society, as at the beginning, or renovation of the World after the Flood; or who upon the di&s;&s;olution of the Societys to which they did once belong, or by &s;ome other accident, have bin oblig'd to &s;eek new habita|tions. Such were tho&s;e who went from <HI>Babylon</HI> upon the confu&s;ion of Tongues, tho&s;e who e&s;cap'd from <HI>Troy</HI> when it was burnt by the <HI>Greci|ans;</HI> almo&s;t all the Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> with many of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> up|on the di&s;&s;olution of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire. To which may be added a mul|titude of Northern Nations, who, when they had increas'd to &s;uch num|bers that their Countrys could no longer nouri&s;h them, or becau&s;e they wanted skill to improve their Lands, were &s;ent out to provide for them|&s;elves, and having done &s;o, did erect many Kingdoms and States, either by them&s;elves, or in union and coalition with the antient Inhabitants.</P>
<P>'Tis in vain to &s;ay, that where&s;oever they came, the Land did belong to &s;ome body, and that they who came to dwell there mu&s;t be &s;ubject to the Laws of tho&s;e who were Lords of the Soil, for that is not always true in fact. Some come into de&s;ert Countrys that have no Lord, others into &s;uch as are thinly peopled, by men who knowing not how to improve their Land, do either grant part of it upon ea&s;y terms to the new comers, or grow into a union with them in the enjoyment of the whole; and Hi&s;torys furni&s;h us with infinite examples of this nature.</P>
<P>If we will look into our own original, without troubling our &s;elves with the &s;en&s;le&s;s &s;torys of <HI>Samothes</HI> the Son of <HI>Japhet,</HI> and his Magicians, or the Giants begotten by Spirits upon the thirty Daughters of <HI>Danaus,</HI> &s;ent from <HI>Phenicia</HI> in a Boat without Sails, Oars or Rudder, we &s;hall find that when the <HI>Romans</HI> abandon'd this I&s;land, the Inhabitants were left to a full li|berty of providing for them&s;elves: and whether we deduce our Original from them or the <HI>Saxons,</HI> or from both, our Ance&s;tors were perfectly free; and the <HI>Normans</HI> having inherited the &s;ame Right when they came to be one Nation with the former, we cannot but continue &s;o &s;till, unle&s;s we have en&s;lav'd our &s;elves.</P>
<P>Nothing is more contrary to rea&s;on than to imagin this. When the fierce barbarity of the <HI>Saxons</HI> came to be &s;oftned by a more gentle Climat, the Arts and Religion they learnt, taught them to reform their Manners, and better enabled them to frame Laws for the pre&s;ervation of their Li|berty, but no way dimi&s;h'd their love to it: and tho the <HI>Normans</HI> might de&s;ire to get the Laads of tho&s;e who had join'd with <HI>Harold,</HI> and of others into their hands; yet when they were &s;ettled in the Country, and by mar|riages united to the antient Inhabitants, they became true Engli&s;hmen, and no le&s;s lovers of Liberty, and re&s;olute defenders of it, than the <HI>Saxons</HI> had bin. There was then neither conquering <HI>Norman</HI> nor conquer'd <HI>Saxon,</HI> but a great and brave People compos'd of both, united in blood and in|tere&s;t in the defence of their common Rights, which they &s;o well main|tain'd, that no Prince &s;ince that time has too violently encroach'd upon them, who, as the reward of his folly, has not liv'd mi&s;erably, and dy'd &s;hamefully.</P>
<P><PB N="372" REF="380">
  Such actions of our Ance&s;tors do not, as I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;avor much of the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which patrimonial &s;laves do u&s;ually render to the will of their Lord. On the contrary, what&s;oever they did was by a power inhe|rent in them&s;elves to defend that Liberty in which they were born.

<HEAD>SECT. XXXIV. No Veneration paid, or Honor confer'd upon a ju&s;t and lawful Magi|&s;trate, can dimini&s;h the Liberty of a Nation.</HEAD>
<P>SOME have &s;uppos'd, that tho the People be naturally free, and Ma|gi&s;trats created by them, they do by &s;uch Creations deprive them|&s;elves of that natural Liberty; and that the names of <HI>King, Sovereign Lord,</HI> and <HI>Dread Sovereign,</HI> being no way con&s;i&s;tent with Liberty, they who give &s;uch Titles do renounce it. Our Author carrys this very far, and lays great weight upon the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Language us'd by the Peo|ple, when they <HI>humbly crave that his Maje&s;ty would be pleas'd to grant their accu&s;tom'd freedom of &s;peech, and acce&s;s to his Per&s;on;</HI> and <HI>give the name of Supplications and Petitions to the Addre&s;&s;es made to him:</HI> Whereas he an&s;wers in the haughty Language of <HI>Le Roy le veut, Le Roy s'avi&s;era,</HI> and the like. But they who talk at this rate, &s;hew, that they neither un|der&s;tand the nature of Magi&s;tracy, nor the practice of Nations. Tho&s;e who have liv'd in the highe&s;t exerci&s;e of their Liberty, and have bin mo&s;t tenacious of it, have thought no Honor too great for &s;uch Magi&s;trats as were eminent in the defence of their Rights, and &s;et up for that end. The name of Dread Sovereign might ju&s;tly have bin given to a <HI>Roman</HI> Dictator, or Con&s;ul, for they had the Sovereign Authority in their hands, and power &s;ufficient for its execution. Whil&s;t their Magi&s;tracy continu'd, they were a terror to the &s;ame men, who&s;e Axes and Rods had bin a terror to them the year or month before, and might be &s;o again the next. The <HI>Romans</HI> thought they could not be guilty of exce&s;s in carrying the power and veneration due to their Dictator to the highe&s;t: And <HI>Livy</HI> tells us, that his <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edictum Dictatoris pro numine ob&s;ervatum. <BIBL><HI>Hi&s;t.</HI> l. 8.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>Edicts were e&s;teem'd &s;acred.</HI> I have already &s;hewn that this haughty People, who might have commanded, conde&s;cended to join with their Tribuns in a Petition to the Dictator <HI>Papirius,</HI> for the Life of <HI>Quintus Fabius,</HI> who had fought a Battel in his ab&s;ence, and with|out his order, tho he had gain'd a great and memorable Victory. The &s;ame <HI>Fabius,</HI> when Con&s;ul, was commended by his Father <HI>Q. Fabius Maximus,</HI>
<PB N="373" REF="381">
for obliging him by his Lictors to di&s;mount from his Hor&s;e, and to pay   him the &s;ame re&s;pect that was due from others. The Tribuns of the Peo|ple, who were in&s;tituted for the pre&s;ervation of Liberty, were al&s;o e|&s;teem'd &s;acred and inviolable, as appears by that phra&s;e, <HI>Sacro&s;ancta Tri|bunorum pote&s;tas,</HI> &s;o common in their antient Writers. No man, I pre|&s;ume, thinks any Monarchy more limited, or more clearly deriv'd from a delegated Power, than that of the <HI>German</HI> Emperors; and yet <HI>Sacra Cae&s;area Maje&s;tas</HI> is the publick &s;tile. Nay, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> at this day call their Burgerma&s;ters, tho they &s;ee them &s;elling Herring or Tar, <HI>High and Mighty Lords,</HI> as &s;oon as they are advanc'd to be of the 36, 42 or 48 Magi&s;trats of a &s;mall Town. 'Tis no wonder therefore, if a great Na|tion &s;hould think it conducing to their own glory, to give magnificent Titles, and u&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive language to that one man, whom they &s;et up to be their Head; mo&s;t e&s;pecially, if we con&s;ider that they came from a Country where &s;uch Titles and Languages were principally invented.</P>
<P>Among the <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Grecians</HI> we hear nothing of Maje&s;ty, High|ne&s;s, Serenity and Excellence appropriated to a &s;ingle Per&s;on, but receive them from <HI>Germany</HI> and other Northern Countrys. We find <HI>Maje&s;tas Populi Romani,</HI> and <HI>Maje&s;tas Imperii,</HI> in their be&s;t Authors; but no man &s;peaking to <HI>Julius</HI> or <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> or even to the vanie&s;t of their Succe&s;&s;ors, ever us'd tho&s;e empty Titles, nor took upon them&s;elves the name of Ser|vants, as we do to every fellow we meet in the Streets. When &s;uch ways of &s;peaking are once introduc'd, they mu&s;t needs &s;well to a more than ordinary height in all tran&s;actions with Princes. Mo&s;t of them na|turally delight in vanity, and Courtiers never &s;peak more truth than when they mo&s;t extol their Ma&s;ters, and a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves the names that be&s;t expre&s;s the mo&s;t abject &s;lavery. The&s;e being brought into mode, like all ill Cu&s;toms, increa&s;e by u&s;e; and then no man can omit them without bringing that danger and hatred upon him&s;elf, which few will un|dergo, except for &s;omething that is evidently of great importance. Mat|ters of ceremony and title at the fir&s;t &s;eem not to be &s;o; and being for &s;ome time neglected, they acquire &s;uch &s;trength as not to be ea&s;ily re|mov'd. From private U&s;age they pa&s;s into publick Acts; and tho&s;e Flatterers who gave a beginning to them, propo&s;ing them in publick Councils, where too many of that &s;ort have always in&s;inuated them&s;elves, gain credit enough to make them pa&s;s. This work was farther advanc'd by the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> according to their cu&s;tom of favouring that mo&s;t, which is mo&s;t vain and corrupt; and it has bin u&s;ual with the Popes and their adherents, liberally to gratify Princes for Services render'd to the Church, with Titles that tended only to the prejudice of the people. The&s;e poi&s;onous Plants having taken root, grew up &s;o fa&s;t, that the Titles, which, within the &s;pace of a hundred years, were thought &s;uffi|cient for the Kings and Queens of <HI>England,</HI> have of late bin given to <HI>Monk</HI> and his honourable Dutche&s;s. New phra&s;es have bin invented to plea&s;e Princes, or the &s;en&s;e of the old perverted, as has happen'd to that of <HI>Le Roy s' avi&s;era:</HI> And that which was no more than a liberty to con|&s;ult with the Lords upon a Bill pre&s;ented by the Commons, is by &s;ome men now taken &s;or a Right inherent in the King of denying &s;uch Bills as may be offer'd to him by the Lords and Commons; tho the Coronation Oath obliges him to hold, keep and defend the ju&s;t Laws and Cu&s;toms, <HI>quas vulgus elegerit.</HI> And if a &s;top be not put to this exorbitant abu&s;e, the words &s;till remaining in Acts of Parliament, which &s;hew that their Acts are our Laws, may perhaps be al&s;o aboli&s;h'd.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="382">
  But tho this &s;hould come to pa&s;s, by the &s;lackne&s;s of the Lords and Commons, it could neither create a new Right in the King, nor dimini&s;h that of the People: But it might give a better color to tho&s;e who are Ene|mys to their Country, to render the Power of the Crown arbitrary, than any thing that is yet among us.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXXV. The Authority given by our Law to the Acts perform'd by a King <HI>de facto,</HI> detract nothing from the Peoples right of creating whom they plea&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>THEY who have more regard to the prevailing Power than to Right, and lay great weight upon the Statute of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;e|venth, which authorizes the Acts of a <HI>King de facto,</HI> &s;eem not to con|&s;ider, that thereby they de&s;troy all the pretended right of Inheritance; that he only is King <HI>de facto,</HI> who is receiv'd by the People; and that this reception could neither be of any value in it felf, nor be made valid by a Statute, unle&s;s the People, and their Repre&s;entatives who make the Statute, had in them&s;elves the power of receiving, authorizing and cre|ating whom they plea&s;e. For he is not King <HI>de facto</HI> who calls him&s;elf &s;o, as <HI>Perkin</HI> or <HI>Simnel,</HI> but he who by the con&s;ent of the Nation is po&s;|&s;e&s;t of the Regal Power. If there were &s;uch a thing in nature, as a natu|ral Lord over every Country, and that the right mu&s;t go by de&s;cent, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for any other man to acquire it, or for the people to confer it upon him, and to give the Authority to the Acts of one, who neither is nor can be a King, which belongs only to him who has the right inherent in him&s;elf, and in&s;eparable from him. Neither can it be deny'd, that the &s;ame power which gives the validity to &s;uch Acts as are perform'd by one who is not a King, that belongs to tho&s;e of a true King, may al&s;o make him King; for the e&s;&s;ence of a King con&s;i&s;ts in the validity of his Acts. And 'tis equally ab&s;urd for one to pretend to be a King, who&s;e Acts as King are not valid, as that his own can be valid, if tho&s;e of another are; for then the &s;ame indivi&s;ible Right which our Author, and tho&s;e of his principles a&s;&s;ert to be in&s;eparable from the Per&s;on, would be at the &s;ame time exercis'd and enjoy'd by two di&s;tinct and contrary Powers.</P>
<P>Moreover, it may be ob&s;erv'd, that this Statute was made after frequent and bloody Wars concerning Titles to the Crown; and whether the cau&s;e were good or bad, tho&s;e who were overcome, were not only &s;ub|ject to be kill'd in the field, but afterwards to be pro&s;ecuted as Traitors under the color of Law. He who gain'd the Victory, was always &s;et up to be King by tho&s;e of his party; and he never fail'd to proceed again&s;t his Enemys as Rebels. This introduc'd a horrid &s;eries of the mo&s;t de|&s;tructive mi&s;chiefs. The Fortune of War vary'd often; and I think it may be &s;aid, that there were few, if any, great Familys in <HI>England,</HI> that were not either de&s;troy'd, or at lea&s;t &s;o far &s;haken, as to lo&s;e their Chiefs, and many con&s;iderable branches of them: And experience taught, that in&s;tead of gaining any advantage to the Publick in point of Govern|ment,
<PB N="375" REF="383">
he for whom they fought &s;eldom prov'd better than his Enemy.   They &s;aw that the like might again happen, tho the title of the reigning King &s;hould be as clear as de&s;cent of blood could make it. This brought things into an unea&s;y po&s;ture; and 'tis not &s;trange, that both the Nobi|lity and Commonalty &s;hould be weary of it. No Law could prevent the dangers of battel; for he that had followers, and would venture him|&s;elf, might bring them to &s;uch a deci&s;ion, as was only in the hand of God. But thinking no more could ju&s;tly be requir'd to the full performance of their Duty to the King, than to expo&s;e them&s;elves to the hazard of battel for him; and not being an&s;werable for the &s;ucce&s;s, they would not have that Law which they endeavour'd to &s;upport, turn'd to their de&s;truction by their Enemys, who might come to be the interpreters of it. But as they could be exempted from this danger only by their own Laws, which could authorize the Acts of a King without a Title, and ju&s;tify them for acting under him; 'tis evident that the power of the Law was in their hands, and that the acts of the per&s;on who enjoy'd the Crown, were of no value in them&s;elves. The Law had bin impertinent, if it could have bin done without Law; and the Intervention of the Parliament u&s;ele&s;s, if the Kings <HI>de facto</HI> could have given authority to their own Acts. But if the Parliament could make that to have the effect of Law, which was not Law, and exempt tho&s;e that acted according to it from the penaltys of the Law, and give the &s;ame force to the Acts of one who is not King as of one who is, they cannot but have a power of making him to be King, who is not &s;o; that is to &s;ay, all depends intirely upon their Au|thority.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, he is not King who a&s;&s;umes the title to him&s;elf, or is &s;et up by a corrupt party; but he who according to the u&s;ages requir'd in the ca&s;e is made King. If the&s;e are wanting, he is neither <HI>de facto</HI> nor <HI>de jure,</HI> but <HI>Tyrannus &s;ine Titulo.</HI> Neverthele&s;s, this very man, if he comes to be receiv'd by the People, and plac'd in the Throne, he is thereby made King <HI>de facto.</HI> His Acts are valid in Law; the &s;ame &s;ervice is due to him as to any other: they who render it are in the &s;ame manner protected by the Law; that is to &s;ay, he is truly King. If our Author therefore do allow &s;uch to be Kings, he mu&s;t confe&s;s that power to be good which makes them &s;o, when they have no right in them&s;elves. If he deny it, he mu&s;t not only deny that there is any &s;uch thing as a King <HI>de facto,</HI> which the Statute acknowledges, but that we ever had any King in <HI>Eng|land;</HI> for we never had any other than &s;uch, as I have prov'd before.</P>
<P>By the &s;ame means he will &s;o unravel all the Law, that no man &s;hall know what he has, or what he ought to do or avoid; and will find no remedy for this, unle&s;s he allow, that Laws made without Kings are as good as tho&s;e made with them, which returns to my purpo&s;e: for they who have the power of making Laws, may by Law make a King as well as any other Magi&s;trate. And indeed the intention of this Statute could be no other than to &s;ecure mens Per&s;ons and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and &s;o far to de|clare the power of giving and taking away the Crown to be in the Parlia|ment, as to remove all di&s;putes concerning Titles, and to make him to be a Legal King, whom they acknowledg to be King.</P>

<HEAD>  SECT. XXXVI. The general revolt of a Nation cannot be call'd a Rebellion.</HEAD>
<P>AS Impo&s;tors &s;eldom make lies to pa&s;s in the world, without putting fal&s;e names upon things, &s;uch as our Author endeavour to per&s;uade the People they ought not to defend their Libertys, by giving the name of Rebellion to the mo&s;t ju&s;t and honourable actions that have bin perform'd fer the pre&s;ervation of them; and to aggravate the matter, tell us that Rebellion is like the &s;in of Witchcraft. But tho&s;e who &s;eek after truth, will ea&s;ily find, that there can be no &s;uch thing in the world as the rebel|lion of a Nation again&s;t its own Magi&s;trats, and that Rebellion is not al|ways evil. That this may appear, it will not be ami&s;s to con&s;ider the word, as well as the thing commonly under&s;tood by it, as it is us'd in an evil &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>The word is taken from the Latin <HI>rebellare,</HI> which &s;ignifys no more than to renew a war. When a Town or Province had bin &s;ubdu'd by the <HI>Ro|mans,</HI> and brought under their dominion, if they violated their Faith after the &s;ettlement of Peace, and invaded their Ma&s;ters who had &s;par'd them, they were &s;aid to rebel. But it had bin more ab&s;urd to apply that word to the People that ro&s;e again&s;t the <HI>Decemviri,</HI> Kings or other Magi&s;trats, than to the <HI>Parthians</HI> or any of tho&s;e Nations who had no dependence upon them; for all the circum&s;tances that &s;hould make a Rebellion were wanting, the word implying a &s;uperiority in them again&s;t whom it is, as well as the breach of an e&s;tabli&s;h'd Peace. But tho every private man &s;ingly taken be &s;ubject to the commands of the Magi&s;trate, the whole body of the People is not &s;o; for he is by and for the People, and the Peo|ple is neither by nor for him. The obedience due to him from private men is grounded upon, and mea&s;ur'd by the General Law; and that Law regarding the welfare of the People, cannot &s;et up the intere&s;t of one or a few men again&s;t the publick. The whole body therefore of a Na|tion cannot be ty'd to any other obedience than is con&s;i&s;tent with the com|mon good, according to their own judgment: and having never bin &s;ub|du'd or brought to terms of peace with their Magi&s;trats, they cannot be &s;aid to revolt or rebel again&s;t them, to whom they owe no more than &s;eems good to them&s;elves, and who are nothing of or by them&s;elves, more than other men.</P>
<P>Again, the thing &s;ignify'd by rebellion is not always evil; for tho eve|ry &s;ubdu'd Nation mu&s;t acknowledg a &s;uperiority in tho&s;e who have &s;ub|du'd them, and rebellion dos imply a breach of the peace, yet that &s;upe|riority is not infinite; the peace may be broken upon ju&s;t grounds, and it may be neither a crime nor infamy to do it. The <HI>Privernates</HI> had bin more than once &s;ubdu'd by the <HI>Romans,</HI> and had as often rebel'd. Their <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.

<PB N="377" REF="385">
<HI>be expected from them, if the puni&s;hment &s;hould be remitted:</HI> The Emba&s;&s;a|dor   an&s;wer'd, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Si bonam dederitis, fidam &amp; perpetuam; &s;i malam, haud diuturnam. <BIBL>Liv.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>If the terms you give be good, the Peace will be ob&s;erv'd by us faithfully and perpetually; if bad, it will &s;oon be broken.</HI> And tho &s;ome were offended with the ferocity of the an&s;wer, yet the be&s;t part of the Senat approv'd it as <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Viri &amp; liberi vocem auditam. <BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>worthy of a man and a freeman;</HI> and confe&s;&s;ing that no Man or Nation would continue under an unea&s;y condition longer than they were compel'd by force, &s;aid, <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Eos demum, qui nihil praeterquam de libertate cogitant, dignos e&s;&s;e, qui Romani fiant. <BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>They only were fit to be made</HI> Romans, <HI>who thought nothing valuable but Liberty.</HI> Upon which they were all made Citizens of <HI>Rome,</HI> and obtain'd what&s;oever they had de&s;ir'd.</P>
<P>I know not how this matter can be carry'd to a greater height; for if it were po&s;&s;ible, that a People re&s;i&s;ting oppre&s;&s;ion, and vindicating their own Liberty, could commit a crime, and incur either guilt or infamy, the <HI>Privernates</HI> did, who had bin often &s;ubdu'd, and often pardon'd; but even in the judgment of their Conquerors whom they had offended, the re&s;olution they profe&s;t of &s;tanding to no agreement impos'd upon them by nece&s;&s;ity, was accounted the highe&s;t te&s;timony of &s;uch a Vertue as render'd them worthy to be admitted into a Society and equality with them&s;elves, who were the mo&s;t brave and vertuous people of the world.</P>
<P>But if the patience of a conquer'd People may have limits, and they who will not bear oppre&s;&s;ion from tho&s;e who had &s;par'd their Lives, may de&s;erve prai&s;e and reward from their conquerors, it would be madne&s;s to think, that any Nation can be oblig'd to bear what&s;oever their own Ma|gi&s;trats think fit to do again&s;t them. This may &s;eem &s;trange to tho&s;e who talk &s;o much of conque&s;ts made by Kings; Immunitys, Libertys and Privileges granted to Nations; Oaths of Allegiance taken, and wonder|ful benefits confer'd upon them. But having already &s;aid as much as is needful concerning Conque&s;ts, and that the Magi&s;trate who has nothing except what is given to him, can only di&s;pen&s;e out of the publick Stock &s;uch Franchi&s;es and Privileges as he has receiv'd for the reward of Ser|vices done to the Country, and encouragement of Vertue, I &s;hall at pre|&s;ent keep my &s;elf to the two la&s;t points.</P>
<P>Allegiance &s;ignifys no more (as the words <HI>ad legem</HI> declare) than &s;uch an obedience as the Law requires. But as the Law can require nothing from the whole People, who are ma&s;ters of it, Allegiance can only relate to particulars, and not to the whole Nation. No Oath can bind any other than tho&s;e who take it, and that only in the true &s;en&s;e and meaning of it: but &s;ingle men only take this Oath, and therefore &s;ingle men are only oblig'd to keep it: the body of a People neither dos, nor can perform any &s;uch act: Agreements and Contracts have bin made; as the Tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> and the re&s;t of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> afterward, made a Covenant with <HI>David,</HI> upon which they made him King; but no wi&s;e man can think, that the Nation did thereby make them&s;elves the Creature of their own Creature.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e al&s;o of an Oath ought to be con&s;ider'd. No man can by an Oath be oblig'd to any thing beyond, or contrary to the true meaning of it; private men who &s;wear obedience <HI>ad Legem,</HI> &s;wear no obedience <HI>extra</HI> or <HI>contra Legem:</HI> what&s;oever they promi&s;e or &s;wear, can detract nothing from the publick Liberty, which the Law principally intends to pre&s;erve. Tho many of them may be oblig'd in their &s;everal Stations and Capacitys to render peculiar &s;ervices to a Prince, the People continue as &s;ree as the
<PB N="378" REF="386">
  internal thoughts of a man, and cannot but have a right to pre&s;erve their Liberty, or avenge the violation.</P>
<P>If matters are well examin'd, perhaps not many Magi&s;trats can pretend to much upon the title of merit, mo&s;t e&s;pecially if they or their progeni|tors have continu'd long in Office. The conveniences annex'd to the exerci&s;e of the Sovereign power, may be thought &s;ufficient to pay &s;uch &s;cores as they grow due, even to the be&s;t: and as things of that nature are handled, I think it will hardly be found, that all Princes can pretend to an irre&s;i&s;tible power upon the account of beneficence to their People. When the family of <HI>Medices</HI> came to be ma&s;ters of <HI>Tu&s;cany,</HI> that Country was without di&s;pute, in men, mony and arms, one of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Provinces in the World, as appears by <HI>Macchiavel</HI>'s account, and the rela|tion of what happen'd between <HI>Charles</HI> the eighth and the Magi&s;trats of <HI>Florence,</HI> which I have mention'd already from <HI>Guicciardin.</HI> Now who|ever &s;hall con&s;ider the &s;trength of that Country in tho&s;e days, together with what it might have bin in the &s;pace of a hundred and forty years, in which they have had no war, nor any other plague, than the extortion, fraud, rapin and cruelty of their Princes, and compare it with their pre|&s;ent de&s;olate, wretched and contemptible condition, may, if he plea&s;e, think that much veneration is due to the Princes that govern them, but will never make any man believe that their Title can be grounded upon beneficenee. The like may be &s;aid of the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> who pretend|ing (upon I know not what account) that every Pea&s;ant in the Dutchy ought to pay him two Crowns every half year, did in 1662 &s;ubtilly find out, that in every year there were thirteen halves; &s;o that a poor man who had nothing but what he gain'd by hard labor, was thro his father|ly Care and Beneficence, forc'd to pay &s;ix and twenty Crowns to his Royal Highne&s;s, to be employ'd in his di&s;creet and vertuous plea&s;ures at <HI>Turin.</HI></P>
<P>The condition of the &s;eventeen Provinces of the <HI>Netherlands</HI> (and even of <HI>Spain</HI> it &s;elf) when they fell to the hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> was of the &s;ame nature: and I will confe&s;s as much as can be requir'd, if any other marks of their Government do remain, than &s;uch as are manife&s;t evidences of their Pride, Avarice, Luxury and Cruelty.</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> in outward appearance makes a better &s;how; but nothing in this world is more mi&s;erable, than that people under the fatherly care of their triumphant Monarch. The be&s;t of their condition is, like A&s;&s;es and Ma&s;tiff dogs, to work and fight, to be oppre&s;t and kill'd for him; and tho&s;e among them who have any under&s;tanding well know, that their indu&s;try, courage, and good &s;ucce&s;s, is not only unprofitable, but de|&s;tructive to them; and that by increa&s;ing the power of their Ma&s;ter, they add weight to their own Chains. And if any Prince, or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Princes, have made a more mode&s;t u&s;e of their Power, or more faith|fully di&s;charg'd the tru&s;t repos'd in them, it mu&s;t be imputed peculiarly to them, as a te&s;timony of their per&s;onal Vertue, and can have no effect upon others.</P>
<P>The Rights therefore of Kings are not grounded upon Conque&s;t; the Libertys of Nations do not ari&s;e from the Grants of their Princes; the Oath of Allegiance binds no private man to more than the Law directs, and has no influence upon the whole Body of every Nation: Many Prin|ces are known to their Subjects only by the injurys, lo&s;&s;es and mi&s;chiefs brought upon them; &s;uch as are good and ju&s;t, ought to be rewarded for their per&s;onal Vertue, but can confer no right upon tho&s;e who no way
<PB N="379" REF="387">
re&s;emble them; and whoever pretends to that merit, mu&s;t prove it by   his Actions: Rebellion being nothing but a renew'd War, can never be again&s;t a Government that was not e&s;tabli&s;h'd by War, and of it &s;elf is neither good nor evil, more than any other War; but is ju&s;t or unju&s;t ac|cording to the cau&s;e or manner of it. Be&s;ides, that Rebellion which by <HI>Samuel</HI> is compar'd to Witchcraft, is not of private men, or a People a|gain&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 15. 23.</NOTE>the Prince, but of the Prince again&s;t God: The <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> are often &s;aid to have rebel'd again&s;t the Law, Word, or Command of God; but tho they frequently oppos'd their Kings, I do not find Rebellion imputed to them on that account, nor any ill character put upon &s;uch actions. We are told al&s;o of &s;ome Kings who had bin &s;ubdu'd, and afterwards rebel'd again&s;t <HI>Chedorlaomer</HI> and other Kings; but their cau&s;e is not blam'd, and we have &s;ome rea&s;on to believe it good, becau&s;e <HI>Abraham</HI> took part with tho&s;e who had rebel'd. However it can be of no prejudice to the cau&s;e I defend: for tho it were true, that tho&s;e &s;ubdu'd Kings could not ju&s;tly ri&s;e again&s;t the per&s;on who had &s;ubdu'd them; or that generally no King being once vanqui&s;h'd, could have a right of Rebellion again&s;t his Con|queror, it could have no relation to the actions of a People vindicating their own Laws and Libertys again&s;t a Prince who violates them; for that War which never was, can never be renew'd. And if it be true in any ca&s;e, that hands and &s;words are given to men, that they only may be &s;laves who have no courage, it mu&s;t be when Liberty is overthrown by tho&s;e, who of all men ought with the utmo&s;t indu&s;try and vigor to have defended it.</P>
<P>That this &s;hould be known, is not only nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;afety of Na|tions, but advantageous to &s;uch Kings as are wi&s;e and good. They who know the frailty of human Nature, will always di&s;tru&s;t their own; and de&s;iring only to do what they ought, will be glad to be re&s;train'd from that which they ought not to do. Being taught by rea&s;on and experience, that Nations delight in the Peace and Ju&s;tice of a good Government, they will never fear a general In&s;urrection, whil&s;t they take care it be rightly admini&s;ter'd; and finding them&s;elves by this means to be &s;afe, will never be unwilling, that their Children or Succe&s;&s;ors &s;hould be oblig'd to tread in the &s;ame &s;teps.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid that this may &s;ometimes cau&s;e di&s;orders, I acknowledg it; but no human condition being perfect, &s;uch a one is to be cho&s;en, which carrys with it the mo&s;t tolerable inconveniences: And it being much bet|ter than the irregularitys and exce&s;&s;es of a Prince &s;hould be re&s;train'd or &s;uppre&s;t, than that whole Nations &s;hould peri&s;h by them, tho&s;e Con&s;ti|tutions that make the be&s;t provi&s;ion again&s;t the greate&s;t evils, are mo&s;t to be commended. If Governments were in&s;tituted to gratify the lu&s;ts of one man, tho&s;e could not be good that &s;et limits to them; but all rea&s;onable men confe&s;&s;ing that they are in&s;tituted for the good of Nations, they only can de&s;erve prai&s;e, who above all things endeavour to procure it, and ap|point means proportion'd to that end. The great variety of Governments which we &s;ee in the World, is nothing but the effect of this care; and all Nations have bin, and are more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">or le&s;s happy, as they or their Ance|ce&s;tors have had vigor of Spirit, integrity of Manners, and wi&s;dom to invent and e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch Orders, as have better or wor&s;e provided for this common Good, which was &s;ought by all. But as no Rule can be &s;o exact, to make provi&s;ion again&s;t all conte&s;tations; and all di&s;putes about Right do naturally end in force when Ju&s;tice is deny'd (ill men never wil|lingly &s;ubmitting to any deci&s;ion that is contrary to their pa&s;&s;ions and in|tere&s;ts) the be&s;t Con&s;titutions are of no value, if there be not a Power to
<PB N="380" REF="388">
  &s;upport them. This Power fir&s;t exerts it &s;elf in the execution of Ju&s;tice by the ordinary Officers; but no Nation having bin &s;o happy, as not &s;ome|times to produce &s;uch Princes as <HI>Edward</HI> and <HI>Richard</HI> the Seconds, and &s;uch Mini&s;ters as <HI>Gave&s;ton, Spencer,</HI> and <HI>Tre&s;ilian,</HI> the ordinary Officers of Ju&s;tice often want the will, and always the power to re&s;train them. So that the Rights and Libertys of a Nation mu&s;t be utterly &s;ubverted and aboli&s;h'd, if the power of the whole may not be employ'd to a&s;&s;ert them, or puni&s;h the violation of them. But as it is the fundamental Right of every Nation to be govern'd by &s;uch Laws, in &s;uch Manner, and by &s;uch Per&s;ons as they think mo&s;t conducing to their own good, they cannot be accountable to any but them&s;elves for what they do in that mo&s;t impor|tant affair.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXXVII. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Government was not ill con&s;tituted, the defects more lately ob&s;erv'd proceeding from the change of manners, and corruption of the times.</HEAD>
<P>I Am not ignorant that many hone&s;t and good men acknowledging the&s;e Rights, and the care of our Ance&s;tors to pre&s;erve them, think they wanted wi&s;dom rightly to proportionate the means to the end. 'Tis not enough, &s;ay they, for the General of an Army to de&s;ire Victory; he only can de&s;erve prai&s;e, who has skill, indu&s;try, and courage to take the be&s;t mea&s;ures of obtaining it. Neither is it enough for wi&s;e Legi&s;lators to pre&s;erve Liberty, and to erect &s;uch a Government as may &s;tand for a time; but to &s;et &s;uch clear Rules to tho&s;e who are to put it in execution, that every man may know when they tran&s;gre&s;s; and appoint &s;uch means for re&s;training or puni&s;hing them, as may be us'd &s;peedily, &s;urely, and ef|fectually, without danger to the Publick. <HI>Sparta</HI> being thus con&s;tituted, we hardly find that, for more than eight hundred years, any King pre|&s;um'd to pa&s;s the limits pre&s;crib'd by the Law. If any <HI>Roman</HI> Con&s;ul grew in&s;olent, he might be reduc'd to order without blood, or danger to the Publick; and no Dictator ever u&s;urp'd a power over Liberty till the time of <HI>Sylla,</HI> when all things in the City were &s;o chang'd, that the an|tient foundations were become too narrow. In <HI>Venice</HI> the power of the Duke is &s;o circum&s;crib'd, that in 1300 years, no one except <HI>Falerio</HI> and <HI>Tiepoli,</HI> has dar'd to attempt any thing again&s;t the Laws: and they were immediately &s;uppre&s;t with little commotion in the City. On the other &s;ide, our Law is &s;o ambiguous, perplext and intricate, that 'tis hard to know when 'tis broken. In all the publick conte&s;ts we have had, men of good judgment and integrity have follow'd both partys. The means of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing and procuring Partizans to make good by force the mo&s;t no|torious violations of Liberty, have bin &s;o ea&s;y, that no Prince who has endeavour'd it, ever fail'd to get great numbers of followers, and to do in|finite mi&s;chiefs before he could be remov'd. The Nation has bin brought to &s;ight again&s;t tho&s;e they had made to be what they were, upon the un|equal terms of hazarding all again&s;t nothing. If they had &s;ucce&s;s, they gain'd no more than what was their own before, and which the Law ought to have &s;ecur'd: whereas 'tis evident, that if at any one time the contrary
<PB N="381" REF="389">
had happen'd, the Nation had bin utterly en&s;lav'd; and no victory was   ever gain'd without the lo&s;s of much noble and innocent blood.</P>
<P>To this I an&s;wer, that no right judgment can be given of human things, without a particular regard to the time in which they pa&s;s'd. We e&s;teem <HI>Scipio, Hannibal, Pyrrhus, Alexander, Epimanondas</HI> and <HI>Ce&s;ar,</HI> to have bin admirable Commanders in War, becau&s;e they had in a mo&s;t eminent degree all the qualitys that could make them &s;o, and knew be&s;t how to employ the Arms then in u&s;e according to the di&s;ciplin of their times; and yet no man doubts, that if the mo&s;t skilful of them could be rais'd from the Grave, re&s;tor'd to the utmo&s;t vigor of mind and body, &s;et at the head of the be&s;t Armys he ever commanded, and plac'd upon the Frontiers of <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Flanders,</HI> he would not know how to advance or retreat, nor by what means to take any of the places in tho&s;e parts, as they are now fortify'd and defended; but would mo&s;t certainly be beaten by any in|&s;ignificant fellow with a &s;mall number of men, furni&s;h'd with &s;uch Arms as are now in u&s;e, and following the methods now practis'd. Nay, the manner of marching, encamping, be&s;ieging, attacking, defending and fighting, is &s;o much alter'd within the la&s;t three&s;core years, that no man ob&s;erving the di&s;ciplin that was then thought to be the be&s;t, could po&s;&s;ibly defend him&s;elf again&s;t that which has bin &s;ince found out, tho the terms are &s;till the &s;ame. And if it be con&s;ider'd that political matters are &s;ub|ject to the &s;ame mutations (as certainly they are) it will be &s;ufficient to excu&s;e our Ance&s;tors, who &s;uting their Government to the Ages in which they liv'd, could neither fore&s;ee the changes that might happen in fu|ture Generations, nor appoint remedys for the mi&s;chiefs they did not fore&s;ee.</P>
<P>They knew that the Kings of &s;everal Nations had bin kept within the limits of the Law, by the vertue and power of a great and brave Nobi|lity; and that no other way of &s;upporting a mix'd Monarchy had ever bin known in the World, than by putting the balance into the hands of tho&s;e who had the greate&s;t intere&s;ts in Nations, and who by Birth and E&s;tate enjoy'd greater advantages than Kings could confer upon them for rewards of betraying their Country. They knew that when the No|bility was &s;o great as not ea&s;ily to be number'd, the little that was left to the King's di&s;po&s;al, was not &s;ufficient to corrupt many; and if &s;ome might fall under the temptation, tho&s;e who continu'd in their integrity, would ea&s;ily be able to cha&s;ti&s;e them for de&s;erting the publick Cau&s;e, and by that means deter Kings from endeavouring to &s;educe them from their duty. Whil&s;t things continu'd in this po&s;ture, Kings might &s;afely be tru&s;ted (with the advice of their Council) to confer the commands of the Militia in Towns and Provinces upon the mo&s;t eminent men in them: And whil&s;t tho&s;e Kings were exercis'd in almo&s;t perpetual Wars, and plac'd their glory in the greatne&s;s of the Actions they atchiev'd by the power and valor of their People, it was their intere&s;t always to chu&s;e &s;uch as &s;eem'd be&s;t to de&s;erve that honor. It was not to be imagin'd that thro the weakne&s;s of &s;ome, and the malice of others, tho&s;e Dignitys &s;hould by degrees be turn'd into empty Titles, and become the rewards of the great|e&s;t crimes, and the vile&s;t &s;ervices; or that the noble&s;t of their De&s;cendents for want of them, &s;hould be brought under the name of Commoners, and depriv'd of all privileges except &s;uch as were common to them with their Grooms. Such a &s;tupendous change being in proce&s;s of time in&s;en&s;ibly introduc'd, the foundations of that Government which they had e&s;tabli&s;h'd, were remov'd, and the &s;uper&s;tructure overthrown. The balance by which
<PB N="382" REF="390">
  it &s;ub&s;i&s;ted was broken; and 'tis as impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;tore it, as for mo&s;t of tho&s;e who at this day go under the name of Noblemen, to perform the du|tys requir'd from the antient Nobility of <HI>England.</HI> And tho there were a charm in the name, and tho&s;e who have it &s;hould be immediately fill'd with a &s;pirit like to that which animated our Ance&s;tors, and endeavor to de&s;erve the Honors they po&s;&s;e&s;s, by &s;uch Services to the Country as they ought to have perform'd before they had them, they would not be able to accompli&s;h it. They have neither the Intere&s;t nor the E&s;tates re|quir'd for &s;o great a work. Tho&s;e who have E&s;tates at a rack Rent, have no dependents. Their Tenants, when they have paid what is agreed, owe them nothing; and knowing they &s;hall be turn'd out of their Tene|ments, as &s;oon as any other will give a little more, they look upon their Lords as men who receive more from them than they confer upon them. This dependence being lo&s;t, the Lords have only more mony to &s;pend or lay up than others, but no command of men; and can therefore neither protect the weak, nor curb the in&s;olent. By this means all things have bin brought into the hands of the King and the Commoners, and there is nothing left to cement them, and to maintain the union. The perpe|tual jarrings we hear every day; the divi&s;ion of the Nation into &s;uch fa|ctions as threaten us with ruin, and all the di&s;orders that we &s;ee or fear, are the effects of this rupture. The&s;e things are not to be imputed to our original Con&s;titutions, but to tho&s;e who have &s;ubverted them: And if they who by corrupting, changing, enervating and annihilating the No|bility, which was the principal &s;upport of the antient regular Monarchy, have driven tho&s;e who are truly Noblemen into the &s;ame intere&s;t and name with the Commons, and by that means increas'd a party which never was, and I think never can be united to the Court, they are to an&s;wer for the Con&s;equences; and if they peri&s;h, their de&s;truction is from them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The inconveniences therefore proceed not from the In&s;titution, but from the Innovation. The Law was plain, but it has bin indu&s;triou&s;ly render'd perplex: They who were to have upheld it are overthrown. That which might have bin ea&s;ily perform'd when the People was arm'd, and had a great, &s;trong, vertuous and powerful Nobility to lead them, is made dif|ficult, now they are di&s;arm'd, and that Nobility aboli&s;h'd. Our Ance|&s;tors may evidently appear, not only to have intended well, but to have taken a right cour&s;e to accompli&s;h what they intended. This had effect as long as the cau&s;e continu'd; and the only fault that can be a&s;crib'd to that which they e&s;tabli&s;h'd is, that it has not prov'd to be perpetual; which is no more than may be ju&s;tly &s;aid of the be&s;t human Con&s;titutions that ever have bin in the world. If we will be ju&s;t to our Ance&s;tors, it will become us in our time rather to pur|&s;ue what we know they intended, and by new Con&s;titutions to re|pair the breaches made upon the old, than to accu&s;e them of the defects that will for ever attend the Actions of men. Taking our Affairs at the wor&s;t, we &s;hall &s;oon find, that if we have the &s;ame &s;pirit they had, we may ea&s;ily re&s;tore our Nation to its antient Liberty, Dignity and Happi|ne&s;s; and if we do not, the fault is owing to our &s;elves, and not to any want of vertue and wi&s;dom in them.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXXVIII.   The power of calling and di&s;&s;olving Parliaments is not &s;imply in the King. The variety of Cu&s;toms in chu&s;ing Parliament men, and the Errors a People may commit, neither prove that Kings are or ought to be Ab&s;olute.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE original of Magi&s;tratical Power, the intention of our Ance&s;tors in its creation, and the ways pre&s;crib'd for the direction and limi|tation of it may, I pre&s;ume, &s;ufficiently appear by what has bin &s;aid. But becau&s;e our Author, taking hold of every twig, pretends,</HI> That Kings may call and di&s;&s;olve Parliaments at their plea&s;ure, <HI>and from thence infers</HI> the Power to be wholly in them; <HI>alledges</HI> the various Cu&s;toms in &s;everal parts of this Nation us'd in the Elections of Parliament men, to procced from the King's will; <HI>and</HI> becau&s;e a People may commit Errors, <HI>thinks</HI> all Power ought to be put into the hands of the King:</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, 1. That the Power of calling and di&s;&s;olving Parliaments is not &s;imply in Kings. They may call Parliaments, if there be occa&s;ion, at times when the Law dos not exact it; they are plac'd as Sentinels, and ought diligently to ob&s;erve the motions of the Enemy, and give notice of his approach: But if the Sentinel falls a&s;leep, neglects his duty, or mali|ciou&s;ly endeavors to betray the City, tho&s;e who are concern'd may make u&s;e of all other means to know their danger, and to pre&s;erve them&s;elves. The ignorance, incapacity, negligence or luxury of a King, is a great calamity to a Nation, and his malice is wor&s;e, but not an irreparable ruin. Remedys may be, and often have bin found again&s;t the wor&s;t of their Vices. The la&s;t <HI>French</HI> Kings of the Races of <HI>Meroveus</HI> and <HI>Pe|pin</HI> brought many mi&s;chiefs upon the Kingdom, but the de&s;truction was prevented. <HI>Edward</HI> and <HI>Richard</HI> the Seconds of <HI>England</HI> were not un|like them, and we know by what means the Nation was pre&s;erv'd. The que&s;tion was not who had the Right, or who ought to call Parliaments, but how the Commonwealth might be &s;av'd from ruin. The Con|&s;uls, or other chief Magi&s;trats in <HI>Rome,</HI> had certainly a right of a&s;&s;em|bling and di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the Senat: But when <HI>Hannibal</HI> was at the Gates, or any other imminent danger threaten'd them with de&s;truction; if that Magi&s;trate had bin drunk, mad, or gain'd by the Enemy, no wi&s;e man can think that formalitys were to have bin ob&s;erv'd. In &s;uch ca&s;es eve|ry Man is a Magi&s;trate; and he who be&s;t knows the danger, and the means of preventing it, has a right of calling the Senat or People to an A&s;&s;embly. The People would, and certainly ought to follow him, as they did <HI>Brutus</HI> and <HI>Valerius</HI> again&s;t <HI>Tarquin,</HI> or <HI>Horatius</HI> and <HI>Va|lerius</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Decemviri;</HI> and whoever &s;hould do otherwi&s;e, might for &s;otti&s;hne&s;s be compar'd to the Courtiers of the two la&s;t Kings of <HI>Spain.</HI> The fir&s;t of the&s;e, by name <HI>Philip</HI> the Third, being indi&s;pos'd in cold weather, a <HI>Braziero</HI> of Coals was brought into his Chamber, and plac'd &s;o near to him, that he was cruelly &s;corch'd. A Nobleman then pre&s;ent &s;aid to one who &s;tood by him, <HI>The King burns;</HI> the other an&s;wer'd, it was true, but the Page who&s;e Office it was to bring and re|move
<PB N="384" REF="392">
  the <HI>Braziero,</HI> was not there; and before he could be found, his Maje&s;ty's Legs and Face were &s;o burnt, that it caus'd an <HI>Ery&s;ipelas,</HI> of which he dy'd. <HI>Philip</HI> the Fourth e&s;cap'd not much better, who being &s;urpriz'd as he was hunting by a violent &s;torm of Rain and Hail, and no man pre&s;uming to lend the King a Cloke, he was &s;o wet before the Offi|cer could be found who carry'd his own, that he took a cold, which ca&s;t him into a dangerous Fever. If Kings like the con&s;equences of &s;uch a Re|gularity, they may cau&s;e it to be ob&s;erv'd in their own Familys; but Nations looking in the fir&s;t place to their own &s;afety, would be guilty of the mo&s;t extreme &s;tupidity, if they &s;hould &s;uffer them&s;elves to be ruin'd for adhering to &s;uch Ceremonys.</P>
<P>This is &s;aid upon a &s;uppo&s;ition, that the whole power of calling and di&s;|&s;olving Parliaments is by the Law plac'd in the King: but I utterly deny that it is &s;o; and to prove it, &s;hall give the following Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>(1.) That the King can have no &s;uch Power, unle&s;s it be given to him, for every man is originally free; and the &s;ame power that makes him King, gives him all that belongs to his being King. 'Tis not therefore an inhe|rent, but a delegated Power; and whoever receives it, is accountable to tho&s;e that gave it; for, as our Author is forc'd to confe&s;s, <HI>they who give Authority by Commi&s;&s;ion, do always retain more than they grant.</HI></P>
<P>(2.) The Law for annual Parliaments expre&s;ly declares it not to be in the King's power, as to the point of their meeting, nor con&s;equently their continuance. For they meet to no purpo&s;e if they may not continue to do the work for which they meet: and it were ab&s;urd to give them a power of meeting, if they might not continue till it be done: For, as <HI>Gro|tius</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Qui dat finem, dat media ad finem nece&s;&s;aria.</HI> The only rea&s;on why Parliaments do meet, is to provide for the publick good; and they by Law ought to meet for that end. They ought not therefore to be di&s;|&s;olv'd, till it be accompli&s;h'd. For this rea&s;on the opinion given by <HI>Tre|&s;ilian,</HI> that Kings might di&s;&s;olve Parliaments at their plea&s;ure, was adjudg'd to be a principal part of his Trea&s;on.</P>
<P>(3.) We have already prov'd, that <HI>Saxons, Danes, Normans,</HI> &amp;c. who had no Title to the Crown, were made Kings by Micklegemots, Witte|nagemots, and Parliaments; that is, either by the whole People, or their Repre&s;entatives: Others have bin by the &s;ame Authority re&s;train'd, brought to order, or depos'd. But as it is impo&s;&s;ible that &s;uch as were not Kings, and had no title to be Kings, could by virtue of a kingly Power call Parliaments, when they had none; and ab&s;urd to think that &s;uch as were in the Throne, who had not govern'd according to Law, would &s;uffer them&s;elves to be re&s;train'd, impri&s;on'd, or depos'd by Parliaments, call'd and &s;itting by them&s;elves, and &s;till depending upon their will to be or not to be: 'Tis certain that Parliaments have in them&s;elves a Power of &s;itting and acting for the publick Good.</P>
<P>2. To the &s;econd. The various cu&s;toms us'd in Elections are nothing to this que&s;tion. In the Countys, which make up the Body of the Na|tion, all Freeholders have their Votes: the&s;e are properly <HI>Cives,</HI> Mem|bers of the Commonwealth, in di&s;tinction from tho&s;e who are only <HI>Incolae,</HI> or Inhabitants, Villains, and &s;uch as being under their Parents, are not yet <HI>&s;ui juris.</HI> The&s;e in the beginning of the <HI>Saxons</HI> reign in <HI>England,</HI> compos'd the Micklegemots; and when they grew to be fo numerous that one place could not contain them, or &s;o far di&s;pers'd, that without trouble and danger they could not leave their habitations, they deputed &s;uch as &s;hould repre&s;ent them. When the Nation came to
<PB N="385" REF="393">
be more poli&s;h'd, to inhabit Citys and Towns, and to &s;et up &s;everal Arts   and Trades; tho&s;e who exercis'd them were thought to be as u&s;eful to the Commonwealth, as the Freeholders in the Country, and to de&s;erve the &s;ame Privileges. But it not being rea&s;onable that every one &s;hould in this ca&s;e do what he pleas'd, it was thought fit that the King with his Council (which always con&s;i&s;ted of the <HI>Proceres</HI> and <HI>Magnates Regni)</HI> &s;hould judg what numbers of men, and what places de&s;erv'd to be made Corporations or Bodys Politick, and to enjoy tho&s;e Privileges; by which he did not confer upon them any thing that was his, but according to the tru&s;t repos'd in him, did di&s;pen&s;e out of the publick Stock parcels of what he had receiv'd from the whole Nation: And whether this was to be enjoy'd by all the Inhabitants, as in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter;</HI> by the Common Hall, as in <HI>London;</HI> or by the Mayor, Aldermen, Jurats and Corpora|tion, as in other places, 'tis the &s;ame thing: for in all the&s;e ca&s;es the King dos only di&s;tribute, not give, and under the &s;ame condition that he might call Parliaments, that is, for the publick good. This indeed increa&s;es the Honor of the per&s;on intru&s;ted, and adds weight to the obligation incumbent upon him; but can never change the nature of the thing, &s;o as to make that an inherent, which is only a delegated Power. And as Parliaments, when occa&s;ion requir'd, have bin a&s;&s;embled, have refus&punc;d to be di&s;&s;olv'd till their work was fini&s;h'd, have &s;everely puni&s;h'd tho&s;e who went about to per&s;uade Kings, that &s;uch matters depended ab&s;o|lutely upon their will, and made Laws to the contrary: 'tis not to be imagin'd, that they would not al&s;o have interpos'd their Authority in matters of Charters, if it had bin ob&s;erv'd that any King had notoriou&s;ly abus'd the tru&s;t repos'd in him, and turn'd the Power to his private ad|vantage, with which he was intru&s;ted for the publick good.</P>
<P>That which renders this mo&s;t plain and &s;afe, is, that men cho&s;en in this manner to &s;erve in Parliament, do not act by them&s;elves, but in conjunction with others who are &s;ent thither by pre&s;cription; nor by a Power deriv'd from Kings, but from tho&s;e that chu&s;e them. If it be true therefore that tho&s;e who delegate Powers, do always retain to them&s;elves more than they give, they who &s;end the&s;e men, do not give them an ab&s;olute power of doing what&s;oever they plea&s;e, but retain to them&s;elves more than they confer upon their Deputys: They mu&s;t therefore be ac|countable to their Principals, contrary to what our Author a&s;&s;erts. This continues in force, tho he knows not, that <HI>any Knights and Burge&s;&s;es have ever bin que&s;tion'd by tho&s;e that &s;ent them;</HI> for it cannot be concluded they ought not, or may not be que&s;tion'd, becau&s;e none have bin que&s;tion'd. But in truth they are frequently que&s;tion'd: The People do perpetually judg of the behaviour of their Deputys. When&s;oever any of them has the mi&s;|fortune not to &s;atisfy the major part of tho&s;e that cho&s;e him, he is &s;ure to be rejected with di&s;grace the next time he &s;hall de&s;ire to be cho&s;en. This is not only a &s;ufficient puni&s;hment for &s;uch faults, as he who is but one of five hundred may probably commit, but as much as the greate&s;t and free&s;t People of the World did ever inflict upon their Commanders that brought the greate&s;t lo&s;&s;es upon them. <HI>Appius Claudius, Pomponius,</HI> and <HI>Terentius Varro,</HI> &s;urviv'd the greate&s;t defeats that ever the <HI>Romans</HI> &s;uffer'd; and tho they had caus'd them by their folly and perver&s;ne&s;s, were never puni&s;h'd. Yet I think no man doubts that the <HI>Romans</HI> had as much right over their own Officers, as the <HI>Athenians</HI> and <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> who frequently put them to death. They thought the mind of a Com|mander would be too much di&s;tracted, if at the &s;ame time he &s;hould
<PB N="386" REF="394">
  &s;tand in fear both of the Enemy and his own Countrymen: And as they always endeavour'd to chu&s;e the be&s;t men, they would lay no other ne|ce&s;&s;ity upon them of performing their duty, than what was &s;ugge&s;ted by their own vertue and love to their Country. 'Tis not therefore to be thought &s;trange, if the people of <HI>England</HI> have follow'd the mo&s;t ge|nerous and mo&s;t pro&s;perous Examples. Be&s;ides, if any thing has bin de|fective in their u&s;ual proceedings with their Delegats, the inconvenience has bin repair'd by the mode&s;ty of the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of them that were cho&s;en. Many in all Ages, and &s;ometimes the whole body of the Com|mons have refus'd to give their opinion in &s;ome ca&s;es, till they had con|&s;ulted with tho&s;e that &s;ent them: The Hou&s;e have bin often adjourn'd to give them time to do it; and if this were done more frequently, or that the Towns, Citys and Countys, had on &s;ome occa&s;ions given in&s;tructions to their Deputys, matters would probably have gone better in Parliament than they have often done.</P>
<P>3. The que&s;tion is not, whether the Parliament be impeccable or in|fallible, but whether an A&s;&s;embly of Nobility, with a Hou&s;e of Com|mons compos'd of tho&s;e who are be&s;t e&s;teem'd by their Neighbors in all the Towns and Countys of <HI>England,</HI> are more or le&s;s &s;ubject to error or corruption, than &s;uch a man, woman or child as happens to be next in blood to the la&s;t King. Many men do u&s;ually &s;ee more than one; and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 11. 14.</NOTE>if we may believe the wi&s;e&s;t King, <HI>In the multitude of Coun&s;ellors there is &s;afety.</HI> Such as are of mature Age, good Experience, and approv'd re|putation for Vertue and Wi&s;dom, will probably judg better than children or fools. Men are thought to be more fit for War than women; and tho&s;e who are bred up in Di&s;ciplin, to under&s;tand it better than tho&s;e who never knew any thing of it. If &s;ome Countys or Citys fail to chu&s;e &s;uch men as are eminently capable, all will hardly be &s;o mi&s;taken as to chu&s;e tho&s;e who have no more of Wi&s;dom or Vertue, than is u&s;ually intail'd upon Familys. But <HI>Filmer</HI> at a venture admires the profound Wi&s;dom of the King; tho be&s;ides &s;uch as we have known, Hi&s;torys give us too many proofs, that all tho&s;e who have bin po&s;&s;e&s;t of Crowns, have not excel'd that way. He &s;peaks of Kings in general, and makes no difference between <HI>Solomon</HI> and his fooli&s;h Son. He di&s;tingui&s;hes not our <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t from <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;econd; <HI>Edward</HI> the third from <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd; or <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth from <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth. And becau&s;e all of them were Kings, all of them, if he de&s;erves credit, mu&s;t needs have bin endow'd with profound Wi&s;dom. <HI>David</HI> was wi&s;e as an Angel of God; therefore the pre&s;ent Kings of <HI>France, Spain</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI> mu&s;t have bin &s;o al&s;o, when they were but five years old: <HI>Joan</HI> of <HI>Ca&s;tille</HI> could not be mad, nor the two <HI>Joans</HI> of <HI>Naples</HI> infamous Strumpets, or all his Arguments fall to the ground. For tho <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Wi&s;dom &s;urpa&s;t that of all the people, yet men could not rely equally upon that of <HI>Reho|boam,</HI> unle&s;s it had bin equal. And if they are all equal in Wi&s;dom when they come to be equally Kings, <HI>Per&s;es</HI> of <HI>Macedon</HI> was as great a Captain as <HI>Philip</HI> or <HI>Alexander; Commodus</HI> and <HI>Heliogabalus</HI> were as wi&s;e and ver|tuous as <HI>Marcus Aurelius</HI> and <HI>Antoninus Pius:</HI> Nay, <HI>Chri&s;tina</HI> of <HI>Sweden</HI> in her infancy was as fit to command an Army as her valiant Father. If this be mo&s;t ab&s;urd and fal&s;e, there can be neither rea&s;on nor &s;en&s;e in propo&s;ing, as our Author dos, that the Power &s;hould be in the King, be|cau&s;e the Parliament is not infallible. <HI>It is,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>for the Head to cor|rect, and not to expect the con&s;ent of the Members or Partys peccant to be Judges in their own ca&s;es; nor is it needful to confine the King,</HI> &amp;c.
<PB N="387" REF="395">
Be&s;ides that this is directly contrary to his own fundamental Maxim,   that no man mu&s;t be the Judg of his own ca&s;e, in as much as this would put the Power into the King's hands, to decide the Controver&s;ys between him&s;elf and the people, in which his own Pa&s;&s;ions, private Intere&s;t, and the corrupt Coun&s;els of ill Mini&s;ters, will always lead him out of the way of Ju&s;tice, the inconveniences that may ari&s;e from a po&s;&s;ibility that the Parliament or People is not infallible, will be turn'd to the mo&s;t cer|tain and de&s;tructive mi&s;chiefs; as mu&s;t have fallen out in <HI>Spain,</HI> if, upon a &s;uppo&s;ition that the E&s;tates of <HI>Ca&s;tille</HI> might err, the correction of &s;uch Errors had bin left to the profound Wi&s;dom and exqui&s;it Judgment of <HI>Joan</HI> their Queen and Head, who was &s;tark mad. And the like may be &s;aid of many other Princes, who thro natural or accidental infirmitys, want of age, or dotage, have bin utterly unable to judg of any thing.</P>
<P>The matter will not be much mended, tho I pa&s;s from Ideots and Luna|ticks, to &s;uch as know well enough how to clothe and feed them&s;elves, and to perform the ordinary functions of life; and yet have bin as unca|pable of giving a right judgment concerning the weighty matters of Go|vernment, as the weake&s;t of Children, or the mo&s;t furious of Madmen. Good manners forbid me to enumerate the examples of this kind, which <HI>Europe</HI> has produc'd even in this Age: But I &s;hould commit a greater fault, if I did in &s;ilence pa&s;s over the extravagances of tho&s;e, who being mo&s;t weak in judgment, and irregular in their appetites, have bin mo&s;t impatient of any re&s;traint upon their will. The brave <HI>Gu&s;tavus Adolphus,</HI> and his Nephew <HI>Carolus Gu&s;tavus,</HI> who was not inferior to him in Valor, Wi&s;dom, and love to his people, were content with the Power that the Laws of their Country gave to them: But <HI>Frederick</HI> the fourth of <HI>Den|mark</HI> never re&s;ted till he had overthrown the Liberty of that Nation. <HI>Ca&s;imir</HI> by attempting the like in <HI>Poland,</HI> lo&s;t almo&s;t half that Kingdom; and flying from the other, left all to be ravag'd by <HI>Swedes, Tartars,</HI> and <HI>Co&s;acks.</HI> The pre&s;ent Emperor, who pa&s;s'd his time in &s;etting Songs in Mu&s;ick with a wretched Italian Eunuch, when he ought to have bin at the Head of a brave Army, rais'd to oppo&s;e the Turks in the year 1664, and which under good conduct might have overthrown the Ottoman Empire, as &s;oon as he was deliver'd from the fear of that Enemy, fell upon his own Subjects with &s;uch cruelty, that they are now forc'd to fly to the Turks for protection; the Prote&s;tants e&s;pecially, who find their condition more tolerable under tho&s;e profe&s;t Enemys to Chri&s;tianity, than to be expos'd to the pride, avarice, perfidiou&s;ne&s;s and violence of the Je&s;uits by whom he is govern'd. And the qualitys of the King of <HI>Portu|gal</HI> are &s;o well known, together with the condition to which he would have brought his Kingdom if he had not bin &s;ent to the <HI>Tercera</HI>'s, that I need not &s;peak particularly of him.</P>
<P>If Kings therefore, by virtue of their Office, are con&s;tituted Judges over the body of their People, becau&s;e the People, or Parliaments repre|&s;enting them, are not infallible; tho&s;e Kings who are children, fools, di&s;abled by age, or madmen, are &s;o al&s;o; women have the &s;ame right where they are admitted to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; tho&s;e men who, tho of ripe age and not &s;uperannuated, nor directly fools or madmen, yet ab&s;olutely uncapable of judging important Affairs, or by their pa&s;&s;ions, intere&s;ts, vices, or the malice and wickedne&s;s of their Mini&s;ters, Servants and Fa|vorites, are &s;et to oppre&s;s and ruin the people, enjoy the &s;ame privilege: than which nothing can be imagin'd more ab&s;urd and abominable, nor more directly tending to the corruption and de&s;truction of the Nations

<HEAD>SECT. XXXIX. Tho&s;e Kings only are heads of the People, who are good, wi&s;e, and &s;eek to advance no Intere&s;t but that of the Publick.</HEAD>
<P>THE wor&s;t of men &s;eldom arrive to &s;uch a degree of impudence, as plainly to propo&s;e the mo&s;t mi&s;chievous follys and enormitys. They who are enemys to Vertue, and fear not God, are afraid of men, and dare not offer &s;uch things as the world will not bear, le&s;t by that means they &s;hould overthrow their own de&s;igns. All poi&s;on mu&s;t be di&s;guis'd, and no man can be per&s;uaded to eat Ar&s;enic, unle&s;s it be co|ver'd with &s;omething that appears to be harmle&s;s. <HI>Creu&s;a</HI> would have abhor'd <HI>Medea</HI>'s pre&s;ent, if the pe&s;tilent venom had not bin hidden by the exterior lu&s;tre of Gold and Gems. The Garment that de&s;troy'd <HI>Hercules</HI> appear'd beautiful; and <HI>Eve</HI> had neither eaten of the forbidden Tree, nor given the Fruit to her Husband, if it had not &s;eem'd to be good and plea&s;ant, and &s;he had not bin induc'd to believe that by eating it they &s;hould both be as Gods. The Servants of the Devil have always follow'd the &s;ame method: their malice is carry'd on by fraud, and they have &s;el|dom de&s;troy'd any, but &s;uch as they had fir&s;t deceiv'd. Truth can never conduce to mi&s;chief, and is be&s;t di&s;cover'd by plain words; but nothing is more u&s;ual with ill men than to cover their mi&s;chievous de&s;igns with figurative phra&s;es. It would be too ridiculous to &s;ay in plain terms, that all Kings without di&s;tinction are better able to judg of all matters than any or all their people; they mu&s;t therefore be call'd <HI>the Head,</HI> that thereby they may be inve&s;ted with all the preeminences which in a natu|ral body belong to that part; and men mu&s;t be made to believe the ana|logy between the natural and political body to be perfect. But the mat|ter mu&s;t be better examin'd before this mortal poi&s;on &s;eems fit to be &s;wallow'd.</P>
<P>The word <HI>Head</HI> is figuratively us'd both in Scripture and profane Au|thors in &s;everal &s;en&s;es, in relation to places or per&s;ons, and always im|plys &s;omething of real or &s;eeming preeminence in point of honor or ju|ri&s;diction. Thus <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> is &s;aid to be the head of <HI>Syria; Samaria</HI> of <HI>Ephraim,</HI> and <HI>Ephraim</HI> of the ten Tribes: that is, <HI>Ephraim</HI> was the chief <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Chron. 5.</NOTE>Tribe; <HI>Samaria</HI> was the chief City of <HI>Ephraim,</HI> and <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> of <HI>Syria:</HI> tho it be certain that <HI>Ephraim</HI> had no juri&s;diction over the other Tribes, nor <HI>Samaria</HI> over the other Citys of <HI>Ephraim,</HI> but every one according to the Law had an equal power within it &s;elf, or the Territorys belonging to it; and no privileges were granted to one above another, except to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> in the matter of Religion, becau&s;e the Temple was plac'd there.</P>
<P>The words Head, Prince, principal Man, or Captain, &s;eem al&s;o to be equivocal; and in this &s;en&s;e the &s;ame men are call'd Heads of the Tribes, Princes in the hou&s;es of their Fathers: and 'tis &s;aid, that two hundred Heads of the Tribe of <HI>Reuben</HI> were carry'd away captive by <HI>Tiglath Pilezer,</HI> and proportionably in the other Tribes; which were a &s;trange thing, if the word did imply that &s;upreme, ab&s;olute and infinite Power that our Author attributes to it: and no man of le&s;s under&s;tanding
<PB N="389" REF="397">
than he, can comprehend how there &s;hould be two hundred or more   &s;overeign unlimited Powers in one Tribe, mo&s;t e&s;pecially when 'tis certain that one &s;eries of Kings had for many Ages reign'd over that Tribe and nine more; and that every one of tho&s;e Tribes, as well as the particular Citys, even from their fir&s;t entrance into the promis'd Land, had a full juri&s;diction within it &s;elf. When the <HI>Gileadites</HI> came to <HI>Jephtha,</HI> he &s;u&s;pected them, and ask'd whether indeed they intended to make him <NOTE PLACE="marg">Judg. 12.</NOTE>their Head? they an&s;wer'd, if he would lead them again&s;t the <HI>Ammo|nites,</HI> he &s;hould be their Head. In the like &s;en&s;e when <HI>Jul. Cae&s;ar</HI> in de&s;pair would have kill'd him&s;elf, one of his Soldiers di&s;&s;uaded him from that de&s;ign, by telling him, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LG>
<L>Cum tot ab hac anima populorum vita &s;alu&s;&abque;</L>
<L>Pendeat, &amp; tantus caput hoc &s;ibi fecerit orbis,</L>
<L>Savitia e&s;t volui&s;&s;e mori. <BIBL>Lucan.</BIBL></L>
</LG></NOTE> <HI>That the &s;afety of &s;o many Nations that had made him their Head, depending upon his life, it would be cruelty in him to take &s;uch a re&s;olution.</HI> But for all that, when this Head was taken off, the Body did &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t: upon which I ob&s;erve many fundamental diffe|rences between the relation of this figurative Head (even when the word is rightly apply'd) and that of the natural Head to their re&s;pective Bodys.</P>
<P>The figurative Heads may be many, the natural but one.</P>
<P>The People make or create the figurative Head; the natural is from it &s;elf, or connate with the Body.</P>
<P>The natural Body cannot change or &s;ub&s;i&s;t without the natural Head; but a People may change and &s;ub&s;i&s;t very well without the artificial. Nay, if it had bin true, that the World had cho&s;en <HI>Ce&s;ar,</HI> as it was not, (for he was cho&s;en only by a factious mercenory Army, and the &s;ounde&s;t part &s;o far oppos'd that Election, that they brought him to think of kil|ling him&s;elf) there could have bin no truth in this flattering a&s;&s;ertion, <HI>That the &s;afety of the whole depended upon his Life:</HI> for the World could not only &s;ub&s;i&s;t without him, but without any &s;uch Head, as it had done before he by the help of his corrupted Soldiery had u&s;urp'd the Power; which al&s;o &s;hews that a civil Head may be a matter of convenience, but not of nece&s;&s;ity. Many Nations have had none; and if the expre&s;&s;ion be &s;o far &s;tretch'd, as to make it extend to the annual or temporary Ma|gi&s;trats &s;et up by the <HI>Athenians, Carthaginians, Romans,</HI> and other antient Commonwealths, or to tho&s;e at this day in <HI>Venice, Holland, Switzerland,</HI> and other places, it mu&s;t be confe&s;t that the People who made, depos'd, abrogated, or aboli&s;h'd both the Magi&s;trats and Magi&s;tracys, had the power of framing, directing and removing their Heads, which our Author will &s;ay is mo&s;t ab&s;urd. Yet they did it without any prejudice to them&s;elves, and very often much to their advantage.</P>
<P>In mentioning the&s;e va&s;t and e&s;&s;ential differences between the natural and political Head, I no way intend to exclude others that may be of equal weight; but as all figurative expre&s;&s;ions have their &s;trength only from &s;imilitude, there can be little or none in this, which differs in &s;o many im|portant points, and can therefore be of no effect.</P>
<P>However, Right proceeds from identity, and not from &s;imilitude. The right of a man over me is by being my Father, and not by being like my Father. If I had a Brother &s;o perfectly re&s;embling me as to deceive our Parents, which has &s;ometimes happen'd to Twins, it could give him no right to any thing that is mine. If the power therefore of correcting the partys peccant, which our Author attributes to Kings, be grounded
<PB N="390" REF="398">
  upon the name of Head, and a re&s;emblance between the Heads of the Body politick and Body natural; if this re&s;emblance be found to be ex|ceedingly imperfect, uncertain, or perhaps no way relating to the matter in que&s;tion; or tho it did, and were ab&s;olutely perfect, could confer no right; the allegation of it is impertinent and ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>This being clear'd, 'tis time to examin what the Office of the Head is in a natural Body, that we may learn from thence why that name is &s;ometimes given to tho&s;e who are eminent in political Bodys, and to whom it dos belong.</P>
<P>Some men account the Head to be &s;o ab&s;olutely the &s;eat of all the Sen&s;es, as to derive even that of feeling, which is exercis'd in every part, from the Brain: but I think 'tis not doubted that all the re&s;t have both their &s;eat and function in the Head; and what&s;oever is u&s;eful or hurtful to a man, is by them repre&s;ented to the under&s;tanding; as <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Nihil e&s;t in intellectu, quod non &s;it prius in &s;en&s;u.</HI> This is properly the part of every Magi&s;trate: He is the Sentinel of the Publick, and is to repre&s;ent what he di&s;covers beneficial or hurtful to the Society; which Office belongs not only to the &s;upreme, but proportionably to the &s;ubor|dinate. In this &s;en&s;e were the chief men among the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> call'd <HI>Heads</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Chron. 7. 40.</NOTE><HI>of their Fathers hou&s;e, choice and mighty men of valor, chief of the Princes.</HI> And in the following Chapter mention is made of <HI>nine hundred and fifty Benjamites, chief men in the Hou&s;e of their Fathers.</HI> The&s;e men exercis'd a charitable care over &s;uch as were inferior to them in power and valor, without any &s;hadow of &s;overeignty, or po&s;&s;ibility that there could be &s;o many Sovereigns: and &s;uch as were under their care are &s;aid to be their Brethren; which is not a word of maje&s;ty and domination, but of dear|ne&s;s and equality. The name therefore of Head may be given to a Sove|reign, but it implys nothing of &s;overeignty; and mu&s;t be exercis'd with charity, which always terminates in the good of others. The Head can|not correct or cha&s;ti&s;e; the proper work of that part is only to indicate, and he who takes upon him to do more, is not the Head. A natural body is homogeneous, and cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t if it be not &s;o. We cannot take one part of a Hor&s;e, another of a Bear, and put upon them the head of a Lion; for it would be a Mon&s;ter, that would have neither action nor life. The Head mu&s;t be of the &s;ame nature with the other Members, or it cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t. But the Lord or Ma&s;ter differs <HI>in &s;pecie</HI> from his Ser|vants and Slaves, he is not therefore properly their Head.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the Head cannot have a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence without the Body, nor any intere&s;t contrary to that of the Body; and 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for any thing to be good for the Head, that is hurtful to the Body. A Prince therefore, or Magi&s;trate, who &s;ets up an intere&s;t in him&s;elf di&s;tinct from, or repugnant to that of the people, renounces the title or quality of their Head. In|deed <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was the Head of the <HI>I&s;raelites;</HI> for when God threaten'd to de&s;troy that People, and promis'd to make him a great Nation, he wav'd the particular advantages offer'd to him&s;elf, interceded for them, and pro|cur'd their pardon. Yet he was not able to bear the weight of the Govern|ment alone, but de&s;ir'd that &s;ome might be appointed to a&s;&s;i&s;t him. <HI>Gideon</HI> was the Head of the &s;ame people, but he would not reign him&s;elf, nor &s;uffer his Sons to reign over them. <HI>Samuel</HI> was al&s;o their Head; he took nothing from any man, defrauded none, took bribes from no man, op|pre&s;t none: God and the People were his witne&s;&s;es: He blam'd them for their Rebellion again&s;t God in asking a King, but was no way concern'd for him&s;elf or his Family. <HI>David</HI> likewi&s;e had a right to that Title; for
<PB N="391" REF="399">
he de&s;ir'd that God would &s;pare the People, and turn the effect of his an|ger   again&s;t him&s;elf, and the hou&s;e of his Father. But <HI>Rehoboam</HI> was not their Head; for tho he acknowledg'd that his Father had laid a heavy yoke upon them, yet he told them he would add to the weight; and that if his Father had cha&s;tis'd them with Whips, he would cha&s;ti&s;e them with Scorpions. The Head is no burden to the Body, and can lay none upon it; the Head cannot cha&s;ti&s;e any member; and he who dos &s;o, be it more or le&s;s, cannot be the Head. <HI>Jeroboam</HI> was not the Head of the revolting Tribes; for the Head takes care of the Members, and provides for the &s;afety of the whole: But he thro fear that the people, going to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to wor&s;hip, &s;hould return to the hou&s;e of <HI>David,</HI> by &s;etting up Idols to &s;ecure his own intere&s;ts, drew guilt and de&s;truction upon them. Tho it &s;hould be granted that <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> by a gentle u&s;e of his power, had in a manner expiated the dete&s;table Villanys committed in the acqui&s;ition, and had truly de&s;erv'd to be call'd the Head of the <HI>Romans;</HI> yet that title could no way belong to <HI>Caligula, Claudius, Nero</HI> or <HI>Vitellius,</HI> who neither had the qualitys requir'd in the Head, nor the under&s;tanding or will to perform the office. Nay, if I &s;hould carry the matter farther, and acknowledg that <HI>Brutus, Cincinnatus, Fabius, Camillus,</HI> and others, who, in the time of their annual or &s;horter Magi&s;tracys, had by their vigilance, vertue, and care to pre&s;erve the City in &s;afety, and to provide for the publick good, perform'd the office of the Head, and might de|&s;erve the name; I might ju&s;tly deny it to the greate&s;t Princes that have bin in the world, who having their power for life, and leaving it to de|&s;cend to their children, have wanted the Vertues requir'd for the perfor|mance of their duty: And I &s;hould le&s;s fear to be guilty of an ab&s;urdity in &s;aying, that a Nation might every year change its Head, than that he can be the Head, who cares not for the Members, nor under&s;tands the things that conduce to their good, mo&s;t e&s;pecially if he &s;ets up an Intere&s;t in him&s;elf again&s;t them. It cannot be &s;aid that the&s;e are imaginary ca&s;es, and that no Prince dos the&s;e things; for the proof is too ea&s;y, and the examples too numerous. <HI>Caligula</HI> could not have wi&s;h'd the <HI>Romans</HI> but one Head, that he might cut it off at once, if he had bin that Head, and had advanc'd no Intere&s;t contrary to that of the Members. <HI>Nero</HI> had not burnt the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> if his concernments had bin in&s;eparably uni|ted to tho&s;e of the people. He who caus'd above three hundred thou&s;and of his innocent unarm'd Subjects to be murder'd, and fill'd his whole Kingdom with fire and blood, did &s;et up a per&s;onal Intere&s;t repugnant to that of the Nation; and no better te&s;timony can be requir'd to &s;hew that he did &s;o, than a Letter written by his Son, to take off the penalty due to one of the chief Mini&s;ters of tho&s;e crueltys, for this rea&s;on, that what he had done, was <HI>by the command and for the &s;ervice of his Royal Father.</HI> King <HI>John</HI> did not pur&s;ue the advantage of his people, when he endea|vour'd to &s;ubject them to the Pope or the <HI>Moors.</HI> And whatever Prince &s;eeks a&s;&s;i&s;tance from foreign Powers, or makes Leagues with any &s;tranger or enemy for his own advantage again&s;t his people, however &s;ecret the Treaty may be, declares him&s;elf not to be the Head, but an enemy to them. The Head cannot &s;tand in need of an exterior help again&s;t the Bo|dy, nor &s;ub&s;i&s;t when divided from it. He therefore that courts &s;uch an a&s;&s;i&s;tance, divides him&s;elf from the Body; and if he dos &s;ub&s;i&s;t, it mu&s;t be by a li&s;e he has in him&s;elf, di&s;tinct from that of the Body, which the Head cannot have.</P>
<P><PB N="392" REF="400">
  But be&s;ides the&s;e enormitys, that te&s;tify the mo&s;t wicked rage and fury in the highe&s;t degree, there is another practice, which no man that knows the world can deny to be common with Princes, and incompatible with the nature of a Head. The Head cannot de&s;ire to draw all the nouri&s;h|ment of the Body to it &s;elf, nor more than a due proportion. If the re&s;t of the parts are &s;ick, weak or cold, the Head &s;uffers equally with them; and if they peri&s;h, mu&s;t peri&s;h al&s;o. Let this be compar'd with the actions of many Princes we know, and we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee which of them are Heads of their people. If the Gold brought from the <HI>Indys</HI> has bin equally di&s;tributed by the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> to the body of that Nation, I con&s;ent they may be call'd the Heads. If the Kings of <HI>France</HI> a&s;&s;ume no more of the Riches of that great Kingdom than their due proportion, let them al&s;o wear that honourable name. But if the naked backs and empty bellys of their mi&s;erable Subjects evince the contrary, it can by no means belong to them. If tho&s;e great Nations wa&s;t and langui&s;h; if nothing be &s;o common in the be&s;t Provinces belonging to them, as mi&s;ery, famin, and all the effects of the mo&s;t outrageous oppre&s;&s;ion, whil&s;t their Princes and Favorites po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch trea&s;ures as the mo&s;t wanton prodiga|lity cannot exhau&s;t; if that which is gain'd by the &s;weat of &s;o many millions of men, be torn out of the mouths of their &s;tarving Wives and Children, to foment the vices of tho&s;e luxurious Courts, or reward the Mini&s;ters of their lu&s;ts, the nouri&s;hment is not di&s;tributed equally to all the parts of the Body; the oeconomy of the whole is overthrown, and they who do the&s;e things, cannot be the Heads, nor parts of the Body, but &s;omething di&s;tinct from and repugnant to it. 'Tis not therefore he who is found in, or advanc'd to the place of the Head, who is truly the Head: 'Tis not he who ought, but he who dos perform the office of the Head, that de&s;erves the name and privileges belonging to the Head. If our Author therefore will per&s;uade us that any King is Head of his People, he mu&s;t do it by Arguments peculiarly relating to him, &s;ince tho&s;e in general are found to be fal&s;e. If he &s;ay that the King as King may direct or correct the people, and that the power of determining all controver&s;ys mu&s;t be refer'd to him, becau&s;e they may be mi&s;taken, he mu&s;t &s;how that the King is infallible; for unle&s;s he dos &s;o, the wound is not cur'd. This al&s;o mu&s;t be by &s;ome other way, than by &s;aying he is their Head; for &s;uch Powers belong not to the office of the Head, and we &s;ee that all Kings do not de&s;erve that Name: Many of them want both under&s;tanding and will to perform the functions of the Head; and many act directly contrary in the whole cour&s;e of their Government. If any therefore among them have merited the glorious name of Heads of Nations, it mu&s;t have bin by their per&s;onal Vertues, by a vigilant care of the good of their People, by an in&s;eparable conjunction of intere&s;ts with them, by an ardent love to every member of the Society, by a mode|ration of &s;pirit affecting no undue Superiority, or a&s;&s;uming any &s;ingular advantage which they are not willing to communicate to every part of the political Body. He who finds this merit in him&s;elf, will &s;corn all the advantages that can be drawn from mi&s;apply'd names: He that knows &s;uch honor to be peculiarly due to him for being the be&s;t of Kings, will ne|ver glory in that which may be common to him with the wor&s;t. Nay, whoever pretends by &s;uch general di&s;cour&s;es as the&s;e of our Author, to ad|vance the particular Intere&s;ts of any one King, dos either know he is of no merit, and that nothing can be &s;aid for him which will not as well agree with the wor&s;t of men; or cares not what he &s;ays &s;o he may do mi&s;chief;
<PB N="393" REF="401">

<HEAD>SECT. XL. Good Laws pre&s;cribe ea&s;y and &s;afe Remedys again&s;t the Evils proceeding from the vices or infirmitys of the Magi&s;trate; and when they fail, they mu&s;t be &s;upply'd.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE who de&s;ire to advance the power of the Magi&s;trate above the Law, would per&s;uade us, that the difficultys and dangers of inquiring into his actions, or oppo&s;ing his will when employ'd in violence and inju&s;tice, are &s;o great, that the remedy is always wor&s;e than the di&s;|ea&s;e; and that 'tis better to &s;uffer all the evils that may proceed from his infirmitys and vices, than to hazard the con&s;equences of di&s;plea&s;ing him. But on the contrary, I think and hope to prove,</P>
<P>1. That in well&punc;con&s;tituted Governments, the remedys again&s;t ill Ma|gi&s;trats are ea&s;y and &s;afe.</P>
<P>2. That 'tis good, as well for the Magi&s;trate as the People, &s;o to con|&s;titute the Government, that the Remedys may be ea&s;y and &s;afe.</P>
<P>3. That how dangerous and difficult &s;oever they may be thro the de|fects of the fir&s;t Con&s;titution, they mu&s;t be try'd.</P>
<P>To the fir&s;t: 'Tis mo&s;t evident that in well-regulated Governments the&s;e Remedys have bin found to be ea&s;y and &s;afe. The Kings of <HI>Sparta</HI> were not &s;uffer'd in the lea&s;t to deviate from the rule of the Law: And <HI>Theopompus</HI> one of tho&s;e Kings, in who&s;e time the <HI>Ephori</HI> were created, and the regal Power much re&s;train'd, doubted not to affirm, that it was by <NOTE PLACE="marg">Plutarch.</NOTE>that means become more la&s;ting and more &s;ecure. <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> had not the name of King, but commanded in the War again&s;t <HI>Xerxes</HI> with more than regal Power; neverthele&s;s being grown in&s;olent, he was without any trouble to that State bani&s;h'd and afterwards put to death. <HI>Leonidas</HI> Fa|ther of <HI>Cleomenes,</HI> was in the like manner bani&s;h'd. The &s;econd <HI>Agis</HI> was mo&s;t unju&s;tly put to death by the <HI>Ephori,</HI> for he was a brave and a good Prince; but there was neither danger nor difficulty in the action. Many of the <HI>Roman</HI> Magi&s;trats, after the expul&s;ion of the Kings, &s;eem to have bin de&s;irous to extend their Power beyond the bounds of the Law; and perhaps &s;ome others as well as the <HI>Decemviri,</HI> may have de&s;ign'd an ab&s;olute Tyranny; but the fir&s;t were re&s;train'd, and the others without much difficulty &s;uppre&s;t. Nay, even the Kings were &s;o well kept in order, that no man ever pretended to the Crown unle&s;s he were cho&s;en, nor made any other u&s;e of his Power than the Law permitted, except the la&s;t <HI>Tarquin,</HI> who by his in&s;olence, avarice and cruelty, brought ruin upon him&s;elf and his family. I have already mention'd one or two Dukes of <HI>Venice</HI> who were not le&s;s ambitious, but their crimes return'd upon their own heads, and they peri&s;h'd without any o|ther danger to the State than what had pa&s;s'd before their Trea|&s;ons were di&s;cover'd. Infinite examples of the like nature may be alledg'd; and if matters have not at all times, and in all places, &s;uc|ceeded in the &s;ame manner, it has bin becau&s;e the &s;ame cour&s;es were
<PB N="394" REF="402">
  not every where taken; for all things do &s;o far follow their cau|&s;es, that being order'd in the &s;ame manner, they will always produce the &s;ame effects.</P>
<P>2. To the &s;econd: Such a regulation of the magi&s;tratical Power is not at all grievous to a good Magi&s;trate. He who never de&s;ires to do any thing but what he ought, cannot de&s;ire a Power of doing what he ought not, nor be troubled to find he cannot do that which he would not do if he could. This inability is al&s;o advantageous to tho&s;e who are evil or un|wi&s;e; that &s;ince they cannot govern them&s;elves, a Law may be impos'd upon them, le&s;t by following their own irregular will, they bring de|&s;truction upon them&s;elves, their familys and people, as many have done. If <HI>Apollo</HI> in the Fable had not bin too indulgent to <HI>Phaeton,</HI> in granting his ill conceiv'd reque&s;t, the furious Youth had not brought a nece&s;&s;ity upon <HI>Jupiter,</HI> either of de&s;troying him, or &s;uffering the world to be de|&s;troy'd by him.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, good and wi&s;e men know the weight of Sovereign Power, and mi&s;doubt their own &s;trength. Sacred and human Hi&s;torys furni&s;h us with many examples of tho&s;e who have fear'd the lu&s;tre of a Crown. Men that find in them&s;elves no delight in doing mi&s;chief, know not what thoughts may in&s;inuate into their minds, when rais'd too much above their Sphere. They who were able to bear adver&s;ity, have bin precipitated into ruin by pro&s;perity. When the Prophet told <HI>Hazael</HI> the Villanys he would commit, he an&s;wer'd, <HI>Is thy Servant a dog, that I &s;hould do the&s;e things?</HI> but yet he did them. I know not where to find an ex|ample of a man more excellently qualify'd than <HI>Alexander</HI> of <HI>Macedon;</HI> but he &s;ell under the weight of his own fortune, and grew to exceed tho&s;e in vice, whom he had conquer'd by his vertue. The nature of man can hardly &s;uffer &s;uch violent changes without being di&s;order'd by them; and every one ought to enter into a ju&s;t diffidence of him&s;elf, and fear the temp|tations that have de&s;troy'd &s;o many. If any man be &s;o happily born, &s;o carefully educated, &s;o e&s;tabli&s;h'd in vertue, that no &s;torm can &s;hake him, nor any poi&s;on corrupt him, yet he will con&s;ider he is mortal; and know|ing no more than <HI>Solomon,</HI> whether his Son &s;hall be a wi&s;e man or a fool, he will always fear to take upon him a power, which mu&s;t prove a mo&s;t pe&s;tilent evil both to the per&s;on that has it, and to tho&s;e that are under it, as &s;oon as it &s;hall fall into the hands of one, who either knows not how to u&s;e it, or may be ea&s;ily drawn to abu&s;e it. Supreme Magi&s;trats always walk in ob&s;cure and &s;lippery places: but when they are advanc'd &s;o high, that no one is near enough to &s;upport, direct or re&s;train them, their fall is inevitable and mortal. And tho&s;e Nations that have wanted the prudence rightly to balance the powers of their Magi&s;trats, were frequently oblig'd to have recour&s;e to the mo&s;t violent remedys, and with much difficulty, danger and blood, to puni&s;h the crimes which they might have prevented. On the other &s;ide, &s;uch as have bin more wi&s;e in the con&s;titution of their Governments, have always had regard to the frailty of human nature, and the corruption reigning in the hearts of men; and being le&s;s liberal of the power over their lives and libertys, have re&s;erv'd to them&s;elves &s;o much as might keep their Magi&s;trats within the limits of the Law, and oblige them to perform the ends of their In&s;titution. And as the Law which denounces &s;evere penaltys for crimes, is indeed merciful both to ill men, who are by that means deter&punc;d from committing them; and to the good, who otherwi&s;e vvould be de&s;troy'd; &s;o tho&s;e Nations
<PB N="395" REF="403">
that have kept the reins in their hands, have by the &s;ame act provided as   well for the &s;afety of their Princes as for their own. They who know the Law is well defended, &s;eldom attempt to &s;ubvert it: they are not ea&s;i|ly tempted to run into exce&s;&s;es, when &s;uch bounds are &s;et, as may not &s;afely be tran&s;gre&s;t; and whil&s;t they are by the&s;e means render'd more moderate in the exerci&s;e of their Power, the People are exempted from the odious nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uffering all manner of indignitys and mi&s;erys from their Princes, or by their de&s;truction to prevent or avenge them.</P>
<P>3. To the third: If the&s;e Rules have not bin well ob&s;erv'd in the fir&s;t con&s;titution, or from the changes of times, corruption of manners, in&s;en|&s;ible encroachments, or violent u&s;urpations of Princes, have bin render'd ineffectual, and the People expos'd to all the calamitys that may be brought upon them by the weakne&s;s, vices and malice of the Prince, or tho&s;e who govern him, I confe&s;s the remedys are more difficult and dangerous: but even in tho&s;e ca&s;es they mu&s;t be try'd. Nothing can be fear'd that is wor&s;e than what is &s;uffer'd, or mu&s;t in a &s;hort time fall upon tho&s;e who are in this condition. They who are already fallen into all that is odious, &s;hame|ful and mi&s;erable, cannot ju&s;tly fear. When things are brought to &s;uch a pa&s;s, the bolde&s;t coun&s;els are the mo&s;t &s;afe; and if tho&s;e mu&s;t <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Moriendum victis, moriendum deditis: id &s;olum intere&s;t, an inter cruciatus &amp; ludibria, an per virtutem expiremus. <BIBL>C. Tacit.</BIBL> Quod &s;i nocentes innocente&s;&abque; idem exitus maneat, acrioris viri e&s;t merit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> perire. <BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>peri&s;h who lie &s;till, and they can but peri&s;h who are mo&s;t active, the choice is ea&s;ily made. Let the danger be never &s;o great, there is a po&s;&s;ibility of &s;afety, whil&s;t men have life, hands, arms, and courage to u&s;e them; but that People mu&s;t certainly peri&s;h, who tamely &s;uffer them&s;elves to be op|pre&s;t, either by the inju&s;tice, cruelty and malice of an ill Magi&s;trate, or by tho&s;e who prevail upon the vices and infirmitys of weak Princes. 'Tis in vain to &s;ay, that this may give occa&s;ion to men of rai&s;ing tumults or ci|vil war; for tho the&s;e are evils, yet they are not the greate&s;t of evils. Ci|vil War in <HI>Macchiavel</HI>'s account is a Di&s;ea&s;e, but Tyranny is the Death of a State. Gentle ways are fir&s;t to be us'd, and 'tis be&s;t if the work can be done by them; but it mu&s;t not be left undone if they fail. 'Tis good to u&s;e &s;upplications, advices and remon&s;trances; but tho&s;e who have no re|gard to Ju&s;tice, and will not hearken to Coun&s;el, mu&s;t be con&s;train'd. 'Tis folly to deal otherwi&s;e with a man who will not be guided by Rea&s;on, and a Magi&s;trate who de&s;pi&s;es the Law: or rather to think him a man, who rejects the e&s;&s;ential principle of a man; or to account him a Magi|&s;trate who overthrows the Law by which he is a Magi&s;trate. This is the la&s;t re&s;ult; but tho&s;e Nations mu&s;t come to it, which cannot otherwi&s;e be pre&s;erv'd. <HI>Nero</HI>'s madne&s;s was not to be cur'd, nor the mi&s;chievous ef|fects of it any otherwi&s;e to be &s;uppre&s;t than by his death. He who had &s;par'd &s;uch a Mon&s;ter when it was in his power to remove him, had brought de&s;truction upon the whole Empire; and by a fooli&s;h clemency made him&s;elf the Author of his future villanys. This would have bin yet more clear, if the World had then bin in &s;uch a temper as to be capable of an intire liberty. But the antient foundations had bin over|thrown, and nothing better could be built upon the new, than &s;ome|thing that might in part re&s;i&s;t that torrent of iniquity, which had over|flow'd the be&s;t part of the World, and give Mankind a little time to breath under a le&s;s barbarous Ma&s;ter. Yet all the be&s;t men did join in the work that was then to be done, tho they knew it would prove
<PB N="396" REF="404">
  but imperfect. The Sacred Hi&s;tory is not without examples of this kind: When <HI>Ahab</HI> had &s;ubverted the Law, &s;et up fal&s;e Witne&s;&s;es and corrupt Judges to de&s;troy the innocent, kill'd the Prophets, and e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd Idolatry, his hou&s;e mu&s;t then be cut off, and his blood be lick'd up by dogs. When matters are brought to this pa&s;s, the deci&s;ion is ea&s;y. The que&s;tion is only, Whether the puni&s;hment of crimes &s;hall fall upon one or a few Per&s;ons who are guilty of them, or upon a whole Nation that is innocent.

<HEAD>SECT. XLI.   The People for whom and by whom the Magi&s;trate is created, can only judg whether he rightly perform his Office or not.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS commonly &s;aid, that no man ought to be the Judg of his own ca&s;e; and our Author lays much weight upon it as a fun|damental Maxim, tho according to his ordinary incon&s;tancy he over|throws it in the ca&s;e of Kings, where it ought to take place if in any; for it often falls out that no men are le&s;s capable of forming a right judgment than they. Their pa&s;&s;ions and intere&s;ts are mo&s;t powerful to di&s;turb or pervert them. No men are &s;o liable to be diverted from Ju&s;tice by the flatterys of corrupt Servants. They never act as Kings, except for tho&s;e by whom and for whom they are created; and acting for others, the account of their actions cannot depend upon their own will. Never|thele&s;s I am not afraid to &s;ay, that naturally and properly a man is the judg of his own concernments. No one is or can be depriv'd of this pri|vilege, unle&s;s by his own con&s;ent, and for the good of that Society into which he enters. This Right therefore mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily belong to every man in all ca&s;es, except only &s;uch as relate to the good of the Communi|ty, for who&s;e &s;ake he has deve&s;ted him&s;elf of it. If I find my &s;elf af|flicted with hunger, thir&s;t, wearine&s;s, cold, heat, or &s;ickne&s;s, 'tis a folly to tell me, I ought not to &s;eek meat, drink, re&s;t, &s;helter, refre&s;hment, or phy&s;ick, becau&s;e I mu&s;t not be the judg of my own ca&s;e. The like may be &s;aid in relation to my hou&s;e, land, or e&s;tate; I may do what I plea&s;e with them, if I bring no damage upon others. But I mu&s;t not &s;et fire to my hou&s;e, by which my Neighbour's hou&s;e may be burnt. I may not erect Forts upon my own Lands, or deliver them to a foreign Ene|my, who may by that means infe&s;t my Country. I may not cut the Banks of the Sea, or tho&s;e of a River, le&s;t my Neighbour's Ground be overflown, becau&s;e the Society into which I am incorporated, would by &s;uch means receive prejudice. My Land is not &s;imply my own, but up|on condition that I &s;hall not thereby bring damage upon the Publick, by which I am protected in the peaceable enjoyment and innocent u&s;e of what I po&s;&s;e&s;s. But this Society leaves me a liberty to take Servants, and put them away at my plea&s;ure. No man is to direct me, of what qua|lity or number they &s;hall be, or can tell me whether I am well or ill &s;erv'd by them. Nay, the State takes no other cognizance of what pa&s;|&s;es between me and them, than to oblige me to perform the contracts I make, and not to do that to them which the Law forbids: that is to &s;ay, the Power to which I have &s;ubmitted my &s;elf, exerci&s;es that juri&s;diction over me, which was e&s;tabli&s;h'd by my con&s;ent, and under which I enjoy all the benefits of Life, which are of more advantage to me than my Li|berty could have bin, if I had retain'd it wholly in my &s;elf. The nature al&s;o and mea&s;ure of this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be determin'd by the rea&s;ons that induc'd me to it. The Society in which I live cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t unle&s;s by rule; the equality in which men are born is &s;o perfect, that no man will &s;uffer his natural Liberty to be abridg'd, except others do the like: I cannot rea|&s;onably expect to be defended from wrong, unle&s;s I oblige my &s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> to do none; or to &s;uffer the puni&s;hment pre&s;crib'd by the Law, if I perform not
<PB N="398" REF="406">
  my engagement. But without prejudice to the Society into which I en|ter, I may and do retain to my &s;elf the Liberty of doing what I plea&s;ein all things relating peculiarly to my &s;elf, or in which I am to &s;eek my own convenience.</P>
<P>Now if a private man is not &s;ubject to the judgment of any other, than tho&s;e to whom he &s;ubmits him&s;elf for his own &s;afety and convenience; and notwith&s;tanding that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, &s;till retains to him&s;elf the right of ordering according to his own will all things merely relating to him|&s;elf, and of doing what he plea&s;es in that which he dos for his own &s;ake; the &s;ame right mu&s;t more certainly belong to whole Nations. When a controver&s;y happens between <HI>Caius</HI> and <HI>Seius</HI> in a matter of Right, neither of them may determin the cau&s;e, but it mu&s;t be refer'd to a Judg &s;uperior to both; not becau&s;e 'tis not fit that a man &s;hould be judg of his own ca&s;e, but becau&s;e they have both an equal Right, and neither of them ows any &s;ubjection to the other. But if there be a conte&s;t between Me and my Servant concerning my Service, I only am to decide it: He mu&s;t &s;erve me in my own way, or be gone if I think fit, tho he &s;erves me never &s;o well; and I do him no wrong in putting him away, if either I intend to keep no Servant, or find that another will plea&s;e me better. I cannot therefore &s;tand in need of a Judg, unle&s;s the conte&s;t be with one who lives upon an equal foot with me. No man can be my Judg, unle&s;s he be my Superior; and he cannot be my Su|perior, who is not &s;o by my con&s;ent, nor to any other purpo&s;e than I con|&s;ent to. This cannot be the ca&s;e of a Nation, which can have no equal within it &s;elf. Controver&s;ys may ari&s;e with other Nations, the deci&s;ion of which may be left to Judges cho&s;en by mutual agreement; but this relates not to our Que&s;tion. A Nation, and mo&s;t e&s;pecially one that is powerful, cannot recede from its own Right; as a private man from the knowledg of his own weakne&s;s and inability to defend him&s;elf, mu&s;t come under the protection of a greater Power than his own. The &s;trength of a Nation is not in the Magi&s;trate, but the &s;trength of a Magi&s;trate is in the Nation. The wi&s;dom, indu&s;try and valor of a Prince may add to the glory and greatne&s;s of a Nation, but the foundation and &s;ub&s;tance will al|ways be in it &s;elf. If the Magi&s;trate and People were upon equal terms, as <HI>Caius</HI> and <HI>Seius,</HI> receiving equal and mutual advantages from each other, no man could be judg of their differences, but &s;uch as they &s;hould &s;et up for that end. This has bin done by many Nations. The antient <HI>Germans</HI> refer'd the deci&s;ion of the mo&s;t difficult matters to their Prie&s;ts: the <HI>Gauls</HI> and <HI>Britans</HI> to the <HI>Druides:</HI> the <HI>Mahometans</HI> for &s;ome Ages to the Califs of <HI>Babylon:</HI> the <HI>Saxons</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> when they had embrac'd the Chri&s;tian Religion, to their Clergy. Whil&s;t all <HI>Eu|rope</HI> lay under the Popi&s;h Super&s;tition, the deci&s;ion of &s;uch matters was fre|quently a&s;&s;um'd by the Pope; men often &s;ubmitted to his judgment, and the Princes that re&s;i&s;ted were for the mo&s;t part excommunicated, depos'd, and de&s;troy'd. All this was done for the &s;ame rea&s;ons. The&s;e men were accounted holy and in&s;pir'd, and the Sentence pronounc'd by them was u|&s;ually reverenc'd as the Judgment of God, who was thought to direct them; and all tho&s;e who refus'd to &s;ubmit, were e&s;teem'd execrable. But no man, or number of men, as I think, at the in&s;titution of a Magi&s;trate, did ever &s;ay, If any difference happen between you or your Succe&s;&s;ors and us, it be &s;hall determin'd by your &s;elf or by them, whether they be men, women, children, mad, fooli&s;h, or vicious. Nay, if any &s;uch thing had bin,
<PB N="399" REF="407">
the folly, turpitude and madne&s;s of &s;uch a &s;anction or &s;tipulation mu&s;t   nece&s;&s;arily have de&s;troy'd it. But if no &s;uch thing was ever known, or could have no effect if it had bin in any place, 'tis mo&s;t ab&s;urd to impo&s;e it upon all. The People therefore cannot be depriv'd of their natural rights upon a frivolous pretence to that which never was and never can be. They who create Magi&s;tracys, and give to them &s;uch name, form and power as they think fit, do only know, whether the end for which they were created, be perform'd or not. They who give a being to the power which had none, can only judg whether it be employ'd to their welfare, or turn'd to their ruin. They do not &s;et up one or a few men, that they and their po&s;terity may live in &s;plendor and greatne&s;s, but that Ju&s;tice may be admini&s;ter'd, Vertue e&s;tabli&s;h'd, and provi&s;ion made for the publick &s;afety. No wi&s;e man will think this can be done, if tho&s;e who &s;et them&s;elves to overthrow the Law, are to be their own Judges. If <HI>Caligula, Nero, Vitellius, Domitian,</HI> or <HI>Heliogabalus,</HI> had bin &s;ubject to no other judgment, they would have compleated the de&s;truction of the Empire. If the di&s;putes between <HI>Dur&s;tus, Evenus</HI> the third, <HI>Dar|dannus,</HI> and other Kings of <HI>Scotland,</HI> with the Nobility and People, might have bin determin'd by them&s;elves, they had e&s;cap'd the puni&s;h|ments they &s;uffer'd, and ruin'd the Nation as they de&s;ign'd. Other methods were taken; they peri&s;h'd by their madne&s;s; better Princes were brought into their places, and their Succe&s;&s;ors were by their exam|ple admoni&s;h'd to avoid the ways that had prov'd fatal to them. If <HI>Ed|ward</HI> the &s;econd of <HI>England</HI> with <HI>Gave&s;ton</HI> and the <HI>Spencers, Richard</HI> the &s;econd with <HI>Tre&s;ilian</HI> and <HI>Vere,</HI> had bin permitted to be the Judges of their own ca&s;es, they who had murder'd the be&s;t of the Nobility would have pur&s;u'd their de&s;igns to the de&s;truction of &s;uch as remain'd, the en&s;laving of the Nation, the &s;ubver&s;ion of the Con&s;titution, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a mere Tyranny in the place of a mix'd Monarchy. But our Ance&s;tors took better mea&s;ures: They who had felt the &s;mart of the vices and follys of their Princes, knew what remedys were mo&s;t fit to be apply'd, as well as the be&s;t time of applying them. They found the effects of extreme corruption in Government to be &s;o de&s;perately pernicious, that Nations mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily peri&s;h, unle&s;s it be corrected, and the State reduc'd to its fir&s;t principle, or alter'd. Which being the ca&s;e, it was as ea&s;y for them to judg, whether the Governor who had introduc'd that corruption &s;hould be brought to order, or remov'd if he would not be reclaim'd; or whether he &s;hould be &s;uffer'd to ruin them and their po&s;terity; as it is for me to judg, whether I &s;hould put away my Servant, if I knew he intended to poi&s;on or murder me, and had a certain facility of accompli&s;hing his de&s;ign; or whether I &s;hould continue him in my &s;ervice till he had perform'd it. Nay, the matter is &s;o much the more plain on the &s;ide of the Nation, as the di&s;proportion of merit between a whole people, and one or a few men entru&s;ted with the power of governing them, is greater than between a private man and his &s;ervant. This is &s;o fully confirm'd by the general con&s;ent of mankind, that we know no Government that has not frequently either bin alter'd in form, or reduc'd to its original purity, by changing the familys or per&s;ons who abus'd the power with which they had bin entru&s;ted. Tho&s;e who have wanted Wi&s;dom and Vertue rightly and &s;ea&s;onably to perform this, have bin &s;oon de&s;troy'd; like the <HI>Goths</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> who by omitting to curb the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mariana.</NOTE>fury of <HI>Witza</HI> and <HI>Rodrigo</HI> in time, became a prey to the <HI>Moors.</HI> Their Kingdom, by this means de&s;troy'd, was never re&s;tor'd; and the remain|der
<PB N="400" REF="408">
  of that Nation, joining with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> whom they had kept in &s;ubjection for three or four Ages, could not in le&s;s than eight hun|dred years, expel tho&s;e enemys they might have kept out, only by removing two ba&s;e and vitious Kings. Such Nations as have bin &s;o corrupted, that when they have apply'd them&s;elves to &s;eek reme|dys to the evils they &s;uffer'd by wicked Magi&s;trats, could not fall upon &s;uch as were proportionable to the di&s;ea&s;e, have only vented their Pa&s;&s;ions in de&s;troying the immediate in&s;truments of their op|pre&s;&s;ion, or for a while delay'd their utter ruin. But the root &s;till remaining, it &s;oon produc'd the &s;ame poi&s;onous fruit, and either quite de&s;troy'd, or made them langui&s;h in perpetual mi&s;ery. The <HI>Roman</HI> Empire was the mo&s;t eminent example of the fir&s;t; many of the mon&s;ters that had tyranniz'd over them were kill'd, but the grea|te&s;t advantage gain'd by their death, was a re&s;pite from ruin; and the Government, which ought to have bin e&s;tabli&s;h'd by good Laws, depending only upon the Vertue of one man, his Life prov'd to be no more than a lucid interval, and at his death they relaps'd into the depth of Infamy and Mi&s;ery: and in this condition they continu'd till that Empire was totally &s;ubverted.</P>
<P>All the Kingdoms of the <HI>Arabians, Medes, Per&s;ians, Moors,</HI> and others of the Ea&s;t, are of the other &s;ort. Common &s;en&s;e in&s;tructs them, that barbarous pride, cruelty, and madne&s;s grown to extre|mity, cannot be born: but they have no other way than to kill the Tyrant, and to do the like to his Succe&s;&s;or if he falls into the &s;ame crimes. Wanting that Wi&s;dom and Valor which is requir'd for the in&s;titution of a good Government, they langui&s;h in perpetual &s;lavery, and propo&s;e to them&s;elves nothing better than to live under a gentle Ma&s;ter, which is but a precarious life, and little to be valu'd by men of bravery and &s;pirit. But tho&s;e Nations that are more generous, who &s;et a higher value upon Liberty, and better under&s;tand the ways of pre&s;erving it, think it a &s;mall matter to de&s;troy a Tyrant, unle&s;s they can al&s;o de&s;troy the Tyranny. They endeavour to do the work thorowly, either by changing the Government intirely, or reform|ing it according to the fir&s;t in&s;titution, and making &s;uch good Laws as may pre&s;erve its integrity when reform'd. This has bin &s;o fre|quent in all the Nations (both antient and modern) with who&s;e actions we are be&s;t acquainted, as appears by the foregoing examples, and many others that might be alledg'd if the ca&s;e were not clear, that there is not one of them which will not furni&s;h us with many in&s;tances; and no one Magi&s;tracy now in being which dos not owe its original to &s;ome Judgment of this nature. So that they mu&s;t either derive their right from &s;uch actions, or confe&s;s they have none at all, and leave the Nations to their original Liberty of &s;etting up tho&s;e Magi|&s;tracys which be&s;t plea&s;e them&s;elves, without any re&s;triction or obligati|on to regard one per&s;on or family more than another.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XLII.   The Per&s;on that wears the Crown cannot determin the Affairs which the Law refers to the King.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author, with the re&s;t of the vulgar, &s;eems to have bin led in|to gro&s;s errors by the form of Writs &s;ummoning per&s;ons to appear before the King. The common &s;tile us'd in the trial of Delinquents; the name of the King's Witne&s;&s;es given to tho&s;e who accu&s;e them; the Ver|dicts brought in by Jurys, <HI>coram domino Rege,</HI> and the pro&s;ecution made in the King's name, &s;eem to have caus'd this. And they who under&s;tand not the&s;e Phra&s;es, render the Law a heap of the mo&s;t gro&s;s ab&s;urditys, and the King an Enemy to every one of his Subjects, when he ought to be a Father to them all; &s;ince without any particular con&s;ideration or examination of what any Witne&s;s depo&s;es in a Court of Ju&s;tice, tending to the death, confi&s;cation, or other puni&s;hment of any man, he is call'd the King's Witne&s;s whether he &s;peak the truth or a lie, and on that ac|count favor'd. 'Tis not nece&s;&s;ary to alledg many in&s;tances in a ca&s;e that is &s;o plain; but it may not be ami&s;s to in&s;ert two or three of the mo&s;t important rea&s;ons to prove my a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>1. If the Law did intend that he or &s;he who wears the Crown, &s;hould in his or her per&s;on judg all cau&s;es, and determin the mo&s;t difficult que&s;ti|ons, it mn&s;t like our Author pre&s;ume that they will always be of pro|found wi&s;dom to comprehend all of them, and of perfect integrity al|ways to act according to their under&s;tanding. Which is no le&s;s than to lay the foundation of the Government upon a thing merely contingent, that either never was, or very often fails, as is too much verify'd by ex|perience, and the Hi&s;torys of all Nations; or el&s;e to refer the deci&s;ion of all to tho&s;e who thro the infirmitys of age, &s;ex or per&s;on, are often unca|pable of judging the lea&s;t, or &s;ubject to &s;uch pa&s;&s;ions and vices as would divert them from Ju&s;tice tho they did under&s;tand it; both which &s;eem to be almo&s;t equally prepo&s;terous.</P>
<P>2. The Law mu&s;t al&s;o pre&s;ume that the Prince is always pre&s;ent in all the places where his name is us'd. The King of <HI>France</HI> is (as I have &s;aid already) e&s;teem'd to be pre&s;ent <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sur &s;on lit de ju&s;tice.</NOTE><HI>on the &s;eat of Ju&s;tice</HI> in all the Parliaments and &s;overeign Courts of the Kingdom: and if his corporeal Pre&s;ence were by that phra&s;e to be under&s;tood, he mu&s;t be in all tho&s;e di&s;tinct and far di&s;tant places at the &s;ame time; which ab&s;urdity can hardly be parallel'd, unle&s;s by the Popi&s;h opinion of <HI>Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation.</HI> But indeed they are &s;o far from being guilty of &s;uch mon&s;trous ab&s;urdity, that he cannot in per&s;on be pre&s;ent at any trial, and no man can be judg'd if he be. This was plainly a&s;&s;erted to <HI>Lewis</HI> the 13<HI>th</HI> (when he would have bin at the Trial of the Duke of <HI>Candale)</HI> by the Pre&s;ident <HI>de Bellievre,</HI> who told him that as he could judg no man him&s;elf, &s;o they could not judg any if he were pre&s;ent: upon which he retir'd.</P>
<P><PB N="402" REF="410">
  3. The Laws of mo&s;t Kingdoms giving to Kings the Confi&s;cation of Delinquents e&s;tates, if they in their own per&s;ons might give judgment upon them, they would be con&s;tituted both Judges and Partys; which, be&s;ides the foremention'd incapacitys to which Princes are as much &s;ub|ject as other men, would tempt them by their own per&s;onal intere&s;t to &s;ubvert all manner of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>This therefore not being the meaning of the Law, we are to inquire what it is; and the thing is &s;o plain that we cannot mi&s;take, unle&s;s we do it wilfully. Some name mu&s;t be us'd in all manner of Tran&s;actions, and in matters of publick concernment none can be &s;o fit as that of the prin|cipal Magi&s;trate. Thus are Leagues made, not only with Kings and Em|perors, but with the Dukes of <HI>Venice</HI> and <HI>Genoa,</HI> the Avoyer and Senat of a Canton in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> and the Burgerma&s;ter of an Imperial Town in <HI>Germany,</HI> and the States General of the United Provinces. But no man thinking, I pre&s;ume, the&s;e Leagues would be of any value, if they could only oblige the Per&s;ons who&s;e names are us'd, 'tis plain that they do not &s;tipulate only for them&s;elves; and that their &s;tipulations would be of no value if they were merely per&s;onal. And nothing can more certainly prove they are not &s;o, than that we certainly know, tho&s;e Dukes, Avoyers and Burgerma&s;ters can do nothing of them&s;elves. The power of the States-General of the United Provinces is limited to the points mention'd in the Act of Union made at <HI>&V;trecht.</HI> The Empire is not oblig'd by any &s;tipulation made by the Emperor without their con&s;ent. Nothing is more common than for one King making a League with another, to ex|act a confirmation of their Agreement, by the Parliaments, Diets or Ge|neral <NOTE PLACE="marg">De Jur. Bel. l. 3.</NOTE>E&s;tates; becau&s;e, &s;ays <HI>Grotius,</HI> a <HI>Prince dos not &s;tipulate for him&s;elf, but for the People under his Government;</HI> and <HI>a King depriv'd of his King|dom, lo&s;es the right of &s;ending an Emba&s;&s;ador.</HI> The Powers of <HI>Europe</HI> &s;hew'd them&s;elves to be of this opinion in the ca&s;e of <HI>Portugal.</HI> When <HI>Philip</HI> the &s;econd had gain'd the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, they treated with him concerning the affairs relating to that Kingdom: Few regarded <HI>Don Antonio;</HI> and no man con&s;ider'd the Dukes of <HI>Savoy, Parma</HI> or <HI>Braganza,</HI> who perhaps had the mo&s;t plau&s;ible Titles: But when his Grand&s;on <HI>Philip</HI> the fourth had lo&s;t that Kingdom, and the People had &s;et up the Duke of <HI>Braganza,</HI> they all treated with him as King. And the Engli&s;h Court, tho then in amity with <HI>Spain,</HI> and not a little influenc'd by a Spani&s;h faction, gave example to others, by treating with him and not with <HI>Spain</HI> touching mat|ters relating to that State. Nay, I have bin inform'd by tho&s;e who well under&s;tood the Affairs of that time, that the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> advi&s;ing the late King not to receive any per&s;ons &s;ent from the Duke of <HI>Braganza,</HI> Re|bel to his Ally the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> in the quality of Emba&s;&s;adors; the King an&s;wer'd, that he mu&s;t look upon that per&s;on to be King of <HI>Por|tugal,</HI> who was acknowledg'd by the Nation. And I am mi&s;taken if his Maje&s;ty now reigning did not find all the Princes and States of the world to be of the &s;ame mind, when he was out of his Kingdom, and could oblige no man but him&s;elf and a few followers by any Treaty he could make.</P>
<P>For the &s;ame rea&s;on the names of Kings are us'd in Treatys, when they are either Children, or otherwi&s;e uncapable of knowing what Alliances are fit to be made or rejected; and yet &s;uch Treatys do equally oblige them, their Succe&s;&s;ors and People, as if they were of mature age and fit for government, No man therefore ought to think it &s;trange, if the King's name be us'd in dome&s;tick affairs, of which he neither
<PB N="403" REF="411">
ought nor can take any cognizance. In the&s;e ca&s;es he is perpetually   a Minor: he mu&s;t &s;uffer the Law to take its due cour&s;e; and the Judges, thonominated by him, are oblig'd by Oath not to have any re|gard to his Letters or per&s;onal Commands. If a Man be &s;u'd, he mu&s;t appear; and a Delinquent is to be try'd <HI>coram rege,</HI> but no otherwi&s;e than <HI>&s;ecundum legem terrae, according to the Law of the Land,</HI> not the King's per&s;onal will or opinion. And the judgments given mu&s;t be executed, whether they plea&s;e him or not, it being always under&s;tood that he can &s;peak no otherwi&s;e than the Law &s;peaks, and is always pre&s;ent as far as the Law requires. For this rea&s;on a noble Lord who was irregularly de|tain'd in pri&s;on in 1681, being by <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> brought to the Bar of the King's Bench, where he &s;u'd to be releas'd upon bail; and an igno|rant Judg telling him he mu&s;t apply him&s;elf to the King, he reply'd, that he came thither for that end; that the King might eat, drink, or &s;leep where he pleas'd, but when he render'd Ju&s;tice he was always in that place. The King that renders Ju&s;tice is indeed always there; he never &s;leeps; he is &s;ubject to no infirmity; he never dies unle&s;s the Nation be extin|gui&s;h'd, or &s;o di&s;&s;ipated as to have no Government. No Nation that has a &s;overeign Power within it &s;elf, dos ever want this King. He was in <HI>Athens</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> as well as at <HI>Babylon</HI> and <HI>Su&s;a;</HI> and is as proper|ly &s;aid to be now in <HI>Venice, Switzerland</HI> or <HI>Holland,</HI> as in <HI>France, Morocco</HI> or <HI>Turky.</HI> This is he to whom we all owe a &s;imple and unconditional obe|dience. This is he <HI>who never dos any wrong:</HI> 'Tis before him we appear, when we demand Juice, or render an account of our actions. All Jurys give their verdict in his &s;ight: They are his Commands that the Judges are bound and &s;worn to obey, when they are not at all to con&s;ider &s;uch as they receive from the per&s;on that wears the Crown. 'Twas for Trea|&s;on again&s;t him that <HI>Tre&s;ilian,</HI> and others like to him in &s;everal ages were hang'd. They gratify'd the lu&s;ts of the vi&s;ible Powers, but the invi&s;ible King would not be mock'd. He caus'd Ju&s;tice to be executed upon <HI>Emp|&s;on</HI> and <HI>Dudley.</HI> He was injur'd when the perjur'd wretches, who gave that accurs'd Judgment in the ca&s;e of Shipmony, were &s;uffer'd to e&s;cape the like puni&s;hment by means of the en&s;uing troubles which they had chiefly rais'd. And I leave it to tho&s;e who are concern'd, to con&s;ider how many in our days may expect vengeance for the like crimes.</P>
<P>I &s;hould here conclude this point, if the power of granting a <HI>Noli pro&s;eq: Ce&s;&s;et Proce&s;&s;us,</HI> and Pardons which are &s;aid to be annex'd to the per&s;on of the King, were not taken for a proof that all proceedings at Law depend upon his will. But whoever would from hence draw a general conclu&s;ion mu&s;t fir&s;t prove his propo&s;ition to be univer&s;ally true. If it be wholly fal&s;e, no true deduction can be made; and if it be true only in &s;ome ca&s;es, 'tis ab&s;urd to draw from thence a general conclu&s;ion; and to erect a va&s;t fabrick upon a narrow foundation is impo&s;&s;ible. As to the ge|neral propo&s;ition, I utterly deny it. The King cannot &s;top any Suit that I begin in my own name, or invalidate any Judgment I obtain up|on it: He cannot relea&s;e a Debt of ten &s;hillings due to me, nor a Sen|tence for the like &s;um given upon an action of Battery, A&s;&s;ault, Tre&s;pa&s;s, publick Nui&s;ance, or the like. He cannot pardon a man condemn'd up|on an Appeal, nor hinder the per&s;on injur'd from appealing. His power therefore is not univer&s;al: if it be not univer&s;al, it cannot be inherent, but confer'd upon him, or entru&s;ted by a &s;uperior Power that limits it.</P>
<P><PB N="404" REF="412">
  The&s;e limits are fix'd by the Law, the Law therefore is above him. His proceedings mu&s;t be regulated by the Law, and not the Law by his will. Be&s;ides, the extent of tho&s;e limits can only be known by the inten|tion of the Law that &s;ets them; and are &s;o vi&s;ible, that none but &s;uch as are wilfully blind can mi&s;take. It cannot be imagin'd that the Law, which dos not give a power to the King of pardoning a man that breaks my hedg, can intend he &s;hould have power to pardon one who kills my father, breaks my hou&s;e, robs me of my goods, abu&s;es my children and &s;ervants, wounds me, and brings me in danger of my life. Whatever power he has in &s;uch ca&s;es, is founded upon a pre&s;umption, that he who has &s;worn not to deny or delay ju&s;tice to any man, will not break his Oath to inter|rupt it. And farther, as he dos nothing but what he may rightly do, <HI>cum magnatum &amp; &s;apientum con&s;ilio;</HI> and that 'tis &s;uppos'd, they will never advi&s;e him to do any thing, but what ought to be done, in order to at|tain the great ends of the Law, Ju&s;tice, and the publick &s;afety: never|thele&s;s le&s;t this &s;hould not be &s;ufficient to keep things in their due order, or that the King &s;hould forget his Oath, not to delay or deny ju&s;tice to any man, his Coun&s;ellors are expos'd to the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hments, if they advi&s;e him to do any thing contrary to it, and the Law upon which it is grounded. So that the utmo&s;t advantage the King can pretend to in this ca&s;e, is no more than that of the <HI>Norman,</HI> who &s;aid he had gain'd his cau&s;e, becau&s;e it depended upon a point that was to be decided by his Oath; that is to &s;ay, if he will betray the tru&s;t repos'd in him, and perjure him&s;elf, he may &s;ometimes exempt a Villain from the puni&s;hment he de|&s;erves, and take the guilt upon him&s;elf. I &s;ay &s;ometimes; for Appeals may be brought in &s;ome ca&s;es, and the Waterman who had bin par|don'd by his Maje&s;ty in the year 1680, for a murder he had committed, was condemn'd and hang'd at the A&s;&s;izes upon an Appeal. Nay, in ca|&s;es of Trea&s;on, which &s;ome men think relate mo&s;t particularly to the per&s;on of the King, he cannot always do it. <HI>Gave&s;ton,</HI> the two <HI>Spen|cers, Tre&s;ilian, Emp&s;on, Dudley,</HI> and others, have bin executed as Trai|tors for things done by the King's command; and 'tis not doubted they would have bin &s;av'd, if the King's power had extended &s;o far. I might add the ca&s;es of the Earls of <HI>Strafford</HI> and <HI>Danby;</HI> for tho the King &s;ign d a Warrant for the execution of the fir&s;t, no man doubts he would have &s;av'd him, if it had bin in his power. The other continues in pri&s;on notwith&s;tanding his pardon; and for any thing I know he may continue where he is, or come out in a way that will not be to his &s;atisfaction un|le&s;s he be found innocent, or &s;omething fall out more to his advantage than his Maje&s;ty's approbation of what he has done. If therefore the King cannot interpo&s;e his authority to hinder the cour&s;e of the Law in conte&s;ts between private men, nor remit the debts adjudg'd to be due, or the damages given to the per&s;ons agriev'd, he can in his own per&s;on have no other power in things of this nature, than in &s;ome degree to mitigate the vindictive power of the Law; and this al&s;o is to be ex|ercis'd no other way than as he is entru&s;ted. But if he acts even in this capacity by a delegated power, and in few ca&s;es, he mu&s;t act according to the ends for which he is &s;o entru&s;ted, as the &s;ame Law &s;ays, <HI>Cum mag|natum &amp; &s;apientum con&s;ilio,</HI> and is not therein to pur&s;ue his own will and intere&s;ts: If his Oath farther oblige him not to do it; and his Mini|&s;ters are liable to puni&s;hment, if they advi&s;e him otherwi&s;e: If in matters of Appeal he has no Power: and if his pardons have bin of no value, when contrary to his Oath he has abus'd that with which he
<PB N="405" REF="413">
is entru&s;ted, to the patronizing of crimes, and exempting &s;uch delin|quents   from puni&s;hment, as could not be pardon'd without prejudice to the Publick: I may ju&s;tly conclude, that the King, before whom every man is bound to appear, who dos perpetually and impartially di&s;tribute Ju&s;tice to the Nation, is not the Man or Woman that wears the Crown; and that He or She cannot determin tho&s;e matters, which by the Law are refer'd to the King. Whether therefore &s;uch matters are ordinary or extraordinary, the deci&s;ion is and ought to be plac'd where there is mo&s;t wi&s;dom and &s;tability, and where pa&s;&s;ion and private intere&s;t dos lea&s;t prevail to the ob&s;truction of Ju&s;tice. This is the only way to ob|viate that confu&s;ion and mi&s;chief, which our Author thinks it would in|troduce. In ca&s;es of the fir&s;t &s;ort, this is done in <HI>England</HI> by Judges and Jurys: In the other by the Parliament, which being the Repre&s;entative Body of the People, and the collected Wi&s;dom of the Nation, is lea&s;t &s;ub|ject to error, mo&s;t exempted from pa&s;&s;ion, and mo&s;t free from corruption, their own good both publick and private depending upon the rectitude of their Sanctions. They cannot do any thing that is ill without damage to them&s;elves and their po&s;terity; which being all that can be done by human under&s;tanding, our Lives, Libertys and Propertys are by our Laws di|rected to depend upon them.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XLIII. Proclamations are not Laws.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author, according to his u&s;ual method and integrity, lays great weight upon Proclamations, as the &s;ignifications of the King's plea&s;ure, which in his opinion is our only Law. But neither Law nor Rea&s;on openly directing, nor by con&s;equences in&s;inuating, that &s;uch a Power &s;hould be put into an uncertain or &s;u&s;pected hand, we may &s;afely deny them to be Laws, or in any &s;en&s;e to have the ef|fect of Laws. Nay, they cannot be &s;o much as Significations of his Will; for as he is King, he can have no Will but as the Law directs. If he depart from the Law, he is no longer King, and his Will is no|thing to us. Proclamations, at mo&s;t, are but temporary, by the ad|vice of Council, in pur&s;uance of the Law. If they be not &s;o, the Sub|ject is no way oblig'd to obey them, and the Coun&s;ellors are to be pu|ni&s;h'd for them. The&s;e Laws are either immemorial Cu&s;toms, or Sta|tutes. The fir&s;t have their beginning and continuance from the univer&s;al con&s;ent of the Nation. The latter receive their Authority and Force of Laws from Parliaments, as is frequently expre&s;t in the Preambles. The&s;e are under God the be&s;t defence of our Lives, Libertys, and E&s;tates: they proceed not from the blind, corrupt, and fluctuating humor of a man, but from the mature deliberation of the choice&s;t Per&s;ons of the Nation, and &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s have the greate&s;t intere&s;t in it. Our Ance&s;tors have always rely'd up|on the&s;e Laws; and 'tis to be hop'd we &s;hall not be &s;o abandon'd by God, &s;o depriv'd of courage and common &s;en&s;e, to &s;uffer our &s;elves to be cheat|ed of the Inheritance which they have &s;o frequently, &s;o bravely, and &s;o con&s;tantly defended. Tho Experience has too well taught us, that Par|liaments may have their failings, and that the Vices, which are indu|&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread among them, may be too prevalent; yet they are the be&s;t
<PB N="406" REF="414">
  helps we have, and we may much more rea&s;onably depend upon them, than upon tho&s;e who propagate that corruption among them for which only they can de&s;erve to be &s;u&s;pected. We hope they will take care of our concernments, &s;ince they are as other men &s;o &s;oon as a Se&s;&s;ion is ended, and can do nothing to our prejudice that will not equally af|fect them and their po&s;terity; be&s;ides the guilt of betraying their Coun|try, which can never be wa&s;h'd off. If &s;ome &s;hould prove fal&s;e to their tru&s;t, 'tis probable that others would continue in their integrity: Or if the ba&s;e arts, which are u&s;ually practis'd by tho&s;e who endeavor to de|lude, corrupt, en&s;lave and ruin Nations, &s;hould happen to prevail upon the younge&s;t and weake&s;t, it may be rea&s;onably hop'd, that the wi&s;e&s;t will &s;ee the &s;nares, and in&s;truct their Companions to avoid them. But if all things were &s;o put into the hands of one man, that his Proclamations were to be e&s;teem'd Laws, the Nation would be expos'd to ruin, as &s;oon as it &s;hould chance to fall into an ill hand. 'Tis in vain to &s;ay we have a good King, who will not make an ill u&s;e of his Power; for even the be&s;t are &s;ubject to be deceiv'd by Flatterers, and Crown'd Heads are almo&s;t ever encompa&s;t by them. The principal Art of a Courtier is to ob&s;erve his Ma&s;ter's Pa&s;&s;ions, and to attack him on that &s;ide where he &s;eems to be mo&s;t weak. It would be a &s;trange thing to find a man im|pregnable in every part; and if he be not, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould re&s;i&s;t all the attempts that are made upon him. If his Judgment comes to be pre|po&s;&s;e&s;t, he and all that depend on him are lo&s;t. Contradictions, tho ne|ver &s;o ju&s;t, are then un&s;afe, and no man will venture upon them, but he who dares &s;acrifice him&s;elf for the publick good. The nature of man is frail, and &s;tands in need of a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Vertuous actions that are pro|fitable to the Commonwealth, ought to be made, as far as 'tis po&s;&s;ible, &s;afe, ea&s;y, and advantageous: and 'tis the utmo&s;t imprudence to tempt men to be enemys to the Publick, by &s;uffering the mo&s;t pernicious actions to be the means of obtaining Honor and Favor, whil&s;t no man can &s;erve his Country, but with the ruin of him&s;elf and his family.</P>
<P>However in this ca&s;e the Que&s;tion is not concerning a Per&s;on: the &s;ame Coun&s;els are to be follow'd when <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> or <HI>Samuel</HI> is in the Throne, as if <HI>Caligula</HI> had invaded it. Laws ought to aim at perpetuity, but the Ver|tues of a man dy with him, and very often before him. Tho&s;e who have de&s;erv'd the highe&s;t prai&s;es for wi&s;dom and integrity, have frequently left the honors they enjoy'd to fooli&s;h and vicious Children. If Vertue may in any re&s;pect be &s;aid to outlive the Per&s;on, it can only be when good men frame &s;uch Laws and Con&s;titutions as by favoring it pre&s;erve them&s;elves. This has never bin done otherwi&s;e, than by balancing the Powers in &s;uch a manner, that the corruption which one or a few men might fall into, &s;hould not be &s;uffer'd to &s;pread the contagion to the ruin of the whole. The long continuance of <HI>Lycurgus</HI> his Laws is to be attributed to this: They re&s;train'd the lu&s;ts of Kings, and reduc'd tho&s;e to order who ad|ventur'd to tran&s;gre&s;s them: Whereas the whole fabrick mu&s;t have fallen to the ground in a &s;hort time, if the fir&s;t that had a fancy to be ab&s;olute, had bin able to effect his de&s;ign. This has bin the fate of all Govern|ments that were made to depend upon the vertue of a man, which never continues long in any family, and when that fails all is lo&s;t. The Nations therefore that are &s;o happy to have good Kings, ought to make a right u&s;e of them, by e&s;tabli&s;hing the good that may outla&s;t their Lives. Tho&s;e of them that are good, will readily join in this work, and take care that their Succe&s;&s;ors may be oblig'd in doing the like, to be equally beneficial
<PB N="407" REF="415">
to their own Familys, and the People they govern. If the Rulers of   Nations be re&s;train'd, not only the People are by that means &s;ecur'd from the mi&s;chiefs of their vices and follys, but they them&s;elves are pre&s;erv'd from the greate&s;t temptations to ill, and the terrible effects of the vengeance that frequently en&s;ues upon it. An unlimited Prince might be ju&s;tly compar'd to a weak &s;hip expos'd to a violent &s;torm, with a va&s;t Sail and no Rudder. We have an eminent example of this in the Book of <HI>E&s;ther.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 3.</NOTE> A wicked Villain having fill'd the ears of a fooli&s;h King with fal&s;e &s;torys of the <HI>Jews,</HI> he i&s;&s;ues out a Proclamation for their utter extirpation; and not long after being inform'd of the truth, he gave them leave by another Proclamation to kill whom they pleas'd, which they executed upon &s;eventy thou&s;and men. The Books of <HI>Ezra, Nehemiah</HI> and <HI>Daniel,</HI> manife&s;tly di&s;cover the like fluctuation in all the Coun&s;els of <HI>Nabuchodono&s;or, Cyrus, Darius,</HI> and <HI>Artaxerxes.</HI> When good men had credit with them, they favor'd the <HI>I&s;raelites;</HI> &s;ent them back to their own Country; re&s;tor'd the &s;acred Ve&s;&s;els that had bin taken away; gave them all things nece&s;&s;ary for the rebuilding of the City, and advanc'd the chief of them to the highe&s;t employments. But if they fell into ill hands, three ju&s;t men mu&s;t be thrown into the burning Furnace for refu&s;ing to wor|&s;hip an Idol; <HI>Daniel</HI> mu&s;t be ca&s;t to the Lions; the holy City e&s;teem'd re|bellious, and tho&s;e who endeavor'd to rebuild it, enemys to Kings. Such was the &s;tate of things, when their Proclamations pa&s;s'd for Laws, and numbers of flattering Slaves were ready to execute their Commands, with|out examining whether they were ju&s;t or unju&s;t, good or bad. The life and death of the be&s;t men, together with the very being of Nations, was expos'd to chance, and they were either pre&s;erv'd or de&s;troy'd accord|ing to the humor of that man who &s;poke la&s;t to the King, or happen'd to have credit with him. If a frantick fancy come into the head of a drunken whore, <HI>Per&s;epolis</HI> mu&s;t be burnt, and the hand of <HI>Alexander</HI> is ready to execute her will. If a dancing wench plea&s;e <HI>Herod,</HI> the mo&s;t venerable of all human Heads mu&s;t be offer'd in a di&s;h for a &s;acrifice to the rage of her impure mother. The nature of man is &s;o frail, that where&s;o|ever the word of a &s;ingle Per&s;on has had the force of a Law, the innume|rable extravagances and mi&s;chiefs it has produc'd have bin &s;o notorious, that all Nations who are not &s;tupid, &s;lavi&s;h and bruti&s;h, have always abomi|nated it, and made it their principal care to find out remedys again&s;t it, by &s;o dividing and balancing the Powers of their Government, that one or a few men might not be able to oppre&s;s and de&s;troy tho&s;e they ought to pre&s;erve and protect. This has always bin as grateful to the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t Princes, as nece&s;&s;ary to the weake&s;t and wor&s;t, as I have prov'd already by the examples of <HI>Theopompus, Mo&s;es,</HI> and others. The&s;e con|&s;iderations have given beginning, growth and continuance to all the mix'd Governments that have bin in the World; and I may ju&s;tly &s;ay there ne|ver was a good one that was not mix'd. If other proofs of their rectitude were wanting, our Author's hatred would be enough to ju&s;tify them. He is &s;o bitter an enemy to Mankind, as to be di&s;pleas'd with nothing but that which tends to their good; and &s;o perver&s;e in his judgment, that we have rea&s;on to believe that to be good which he mo&s;t abhors. One would think he had taken the model of the Government he propo&s;es, from the mon|&s;trous Tyranny of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> an I&s;land in the <HI>East-Indys,</HI> where the King knows no other Law than his own will. He kills, tears in pieces, empales, or throws to his Elephants whom&s;oever he plea&s;es: No man has any thing that he can call his own: He &s;eldom fails to de&s;troy tho&s;e who have
<PB N="408" REF="416">
  bin employ'd in his dome&s;tick Service, or publick Offices; and few ob|tain the favor of being put to death and thrown to the Dogs without tor|ments. His Subjects approach him no otherwi&s;e, than on their knees, lick|ing the du&s;t, and dare a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves no other name than that of Dogs, or limbs of Dogs. This is a true pattern of <HI>Filmer</HI>'s <HI>Patriarchical Monarch.</HI> His Maje&s;ty, I &s;uppo&s;e, is &s;ufficiently exalted; for he dos what|ever he plea&s;es. The exerci&s;e of his power is as gentle as can rea&s;onably be expected from one who has all by the unque&s;tionable right of u&s;urpa|tion; and knows the People will no longer &s;uffer him, and the Villains he hires to be the in&s;truments of his Cruelty, than they can be kept in &s;uch ignorance, weakne&s;s and ba&s;ene&s;s, as neither to know how to provide for them&s;elves, or dare to re&s;i&s;t him. We ought to e&s;teem our &s;elves happy, if the like could be e&s;tabli&s;h'd among us; and are much oblig'd to our Author for &s;o kindly propo&s;ing an expedient that might terminate all our di&s;putes. Let Proclamations obtain the power of Laws, and the bu&s;ine&s;s is done. They may be &s;o ingeniou&s;ly contriev'd, that the antient Laws, which we and our Fathers have highly valu'd, &s;hall be aboli&s;h'd, or made a &s;nare to all tho&s;e that dare remember they are <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> and are guilty of the unpardonable crime of loving their Country, or have the courage, conduct, and reputation requir'd to defend it. This is the &s;um of <HI>Filmer</HI>'s Philo&s;ophy, and this is the Legacy he has left to te&s;tify his affection to the Nation; which having for a long time lain unregarded, has bin lately brought into the light again, as an introduction of a Popi&s;h Succe&s;&s;or, who is to be e&s;tabli&s;h'd, as we ought to believe, for the &s;ecurity of the Prote&s;tant Religion, and our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Libertys. Both will undoubtedly flouri&s;h under a Prince who is made to believe the Kingdom is his Pa|trimony; that his Will is a Law, and that he has a Power which none may re&s;i&s;t. If any man doubt whether he will make a good u&s;e of it, he may only examin the Hi&s;torys of what others in the &s;ame circum|&s;tances have done in all places where they have had power. The prin|ciples of that Religion are fo full of meekne&s;s and charity; the Popes have always &s;hew'd them&s;elves &s;o gentle towards tho&s;e who would not &s;ubmit to their Authority; the Je&s;uits, who may be accounted the Soul that give Life to the whole Body of that Faction, are &s;o well natur'd, faithful and exact in their Morals, &s;o full of innocence, ju&s;tice and truth, that no violence is to be fear'd from &s;uch as are govern'd by them. The fatherly care &s;hew'd to the Prote&s;tants of <HI>France,</HI> by the five la&s;t Kings of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Valois;</HI> the mercy of <HI>Philip</HI> the Second of <HI>Spain</HI> to his Pagan Subjects in the <HI>West-Indys,</HI> and the more hated Prote&s;tants in the <HI>Netherlands;</HI> the moderation of the Dukes of <HI>Savoy</HI> towards the <HI>Vaudois</HI> in the Marqui&s;at of <HI>Saluzzo</HI> and the Vallys of <HI>Piedmont;</HI> the gentlene&s;s and faith of the two <HI>Marys</HI> Queens of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland;</HI> the kindne&s;s of the Papi&s;ts to the Prote&s;tants of <HI>Ireland</HI> in 1641; with what we have rea&s;on to believe they did and do &s;till intend, if they can accompli&s;h the ends o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> their Con&s;piracy: In a word, the &s;weetne&s;s and Apo&s;tolical meekne&s;s of the Inqui&s;ition, may &s;ufficiently convince us that nothing is to be &s;ear'd where that Principle reigns. We may &s;uffer the word of &s;uch a Prince to be a Law, and the People to be made to believe it ought to be &s;o&punc; when he is expected. Tho we &s;hould wave the Bill of Exclu|&s;ion, and not only admit him to reign as other Kings have done, but re|&s;ign the whole Power into his hands, it would neither bring inconvenience or danger on the pre&s;ent King. He can with patience expect that na|ture &s;hould take her cour&s;e, and would neither anticipate nor &s;ecure his
<PB N="409" REF="417">
entrance into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Power, by taking one day from the   Life of his Brother. Tho the Papi&s;ts know that like a true Son of their Church, he would prefer the advancement of their Religion before all other con&s;iderations; and that one &s;tab with a Dagger, or a do&s;e of Poi&s;on, would put all under his feet, not one man would be found among them to give it. The A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins were Mahometans, not Pupils of the hone&s;t Je|&s;uits, nor ever employ'd by them. The&s;e things being certain, all our con|cernments would be &s;ecure, if in&s;tead of the fooli&s;h Statutes and antiqua|ted Cu&s;toms on which our Ance&s;tors and we have hitherto doted, we may be troubled with no Law but the King's will, and a Proclamation may be taken for a &s;ufficient declaretion of it. We &s;hall by this means be deli|ver'd from that <HI>Liberty with a mi&s;chief,</HI> in which our mi&s;taken Nation &s;eems &s;o much to delight. This phra&s;e is &s;o new, and &s;o peculiar to our Autor, that it de&s;erves to be written upon his Tomb. We have heard of <HI>Tyranny with a mi&s;chief, Slavery and Bondage with a mi&s;chief;</HI> and they have bin denounc'd by God again&s;t wicked and perver&s;e Nations, as mi&s;chiefs comprehending all that is mo&s;t to be abhor'd and dreaded in the world. But <HI>Filmer</HI> informs us that Liberty, which all wi&s;e and good men have in all Ages e&s;teem'd to be the mo&s;t valuable and glorious privilege of Mankind, is <HI>a mi&s;chief.</HI> If he de&s;erves credit, <HI>Mo&s;es, Jo&s;hua, Gideon, Samp&s;on,</HI> and <HI>Samuel,</HI> with others like them, were enemys to their Country, in de|priving the People of the advantages they enjoy'd under the paternal care of <HI>Pharaoh, Adonibezek, Eglon, Jabin,</HI> and other Kings of the neighbor|ing Nations, and re&s;toring them to that <HI>Liberty with a mi&s;chief</HI> which he had promis'd to them. The <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> were happy under the power of Ty|rants, who&s;e Proclamations were Laws; and they ought to have bin thankful to God for that condition, and not for the deliverances he wrought by the hands of his Servants. Subjection to the will of a man is happine&s;s, Liberty is a <HI>mi&s;chief.</HI> But this is &s;o abominably wicked and de|te&s;table, that it can de&s;erve no an&s;wer.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XLIV. A People that is not free cannot &s;ub&s;titute Delegats.</HEAD>
<P>HOW full &s;oever the Power of any Per&s;on or People may be, he or they are oblig'd to give only &s;o much to their Delegats, as &s;eems convenient to them&s;elves, or conducing to the ends they de&s;ire to attain; but the Delegate can have none except what is confer'd upon him by his Principal. If therefore the Knights, Citizens and Burge&s;&s;es &s;ent by the People of <HI>England</HI> to &s;erve in Parliament have a Power, it mu&s;t be more perfectly and fully in tho&s;e that &s;end them. But (as was prov'd in the la&s;t Section) Proclamations, and other &s;ignifications of the King's plea|&s;ure, are not Laws to us. They are to be regulated by the Law, not the Law by them. They are to be con&s;ider'd only &s;o far as they are con|formable to the Law from which they receive all the &s;trength that is in them, and can confer none upon it. We know no Laws but our own Statutes, and tho&s;e immemorial Cu&s;toms e&s;tabli&s;h'd by the con&s;ent of the Nation; which may be, and often are chang'd by us. The Legi&s;lative Power therefore that is exercis'd by the Parliament, cannot be confer'd by the Writ of Summons, but mu&s;t be e&s;&s;entially and radically in the
<PB N="410" REF="418">
  People, from whom their Delegates and Repre&s;entatives have all that they have. But, &s;ays our Author, <HI>They must only chu&s;e, and trust tho&s;e whom they chu&s;e, to do what they list; and that is as much Liberty as many of us de&s;erve for our irregular Elections of Burge&s;&s;es.</HI> This is ingeniou&s;ly con|cluded: I take what Servant I plea&s;e, and when I have taken him I mu&s;t &s;uffer him to do what he plea&s;es. But from whence &s;hould this nece&s;&s;ity ari&s;e? Why may not I take one to be my Groom, another to be my Cook, and keep them both to the Offices for which I took them? What Law dos herein re&s;train my Right? And if I am free in my private ca|pacity to regulate my particular affairs according to my own di&s;cretion, and to allot to each Servant his proper work, why have not I with my A&s;&s;ociates the Freemen of <HI>England</HI> the like liberty of directing and li|miting the Powers of the Servants we employ in our publick Affairs? Our Author gives us rea&s;ons proportionable to his judgment: <HI>This were liberty with a mi&s;chief; and that of chu&s;ing only is as much as many of us de&s;erve.</HI> I have already prov'd, that as far as our Hi&s;torys reach, we have had no Princes or Magi&s;trats, but &s;uch as we have made, and they have had no other Power than what we have confer'd upon them: They cannot be the judges of our Merit, who have no Power but what we gave them, thro an opinion they did or might de&s;erve it: They may di&s;tribute in parcels to particulars that with which they are entru&s;ted in the gro&s;s. But 'tis impo&s;|&s;ible the Publick &s;hould depend ab&s;olutely upon tho&s;e who are nothing a|bove other men, except what they are made to be, for, and by the Pub|lick. The re&s;trictions therefore of the Peoples Liberty mu&s;t be from them|&s;elves, or there can be none.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, I believe, that the Powers of every County, City and Borough of <HI>England,</HI> are regulated by the general Law to which they have all con&s;ented, and by which they are all made Members of one Political Body. This obliges them to proceed with their Delegats in a manner different from that which is us'd in the United Netherlands, or in <HI>Switzerland.</HI> Among&s;t the&s;e every Province, City or Canton, mak|ing a di&s;tinct Body independent from any other, and exerci&s;ing the So|vereign Power within it &s;elf, looks upon the re&s;t only as Allies, to whom they are bound only by &s;uch Acts as they them&s;elves have made; and when any new thing not comprehended in them happens to ari&s;e, they oblige their Delegats to give them an account of it, and retain the power of determining tho&s;e matters in them&s;elves. 'Tis not &s;o among&s;t us: Every County dos not make a di&s;tinct Body, having in it &s;elf a Sovereign Power, but is a Member of that Great Body which compre|hends the whole Nation. 'Tis not therefore for <HI>Kent</HI> or <HI>Su&s;&s;ex, Lewis</HI> or <HI>Mai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tone,</HI> but for the whole Nation, that the Members cho&s;en in tho&s;e places are &s;ent to &s;erve in Parliament: and tho it be fit for them as Friends and Neighbors (&s;o far as may be) to hearken to the Opinions of the Electors for the Information of their Judgments, and to the end that what they &s;hall &s;ay may be of more weight, when every one is known not to &s;peak his own thoughts only, but tho&s;e of a great number of men; yet they are not &s;trictly and properly oblig'd to give account of their Actions to any, unle&s;s the whole Body of the Nation for which they &s;erve, and who are equally concern'd in their Re&s;olutions, could be a&s;&s;embled. This being impracticable, the only puni&s;hment to which they are &s;ubject if they betray their Tru&s;t, is &s;corn, infamy, hatred, and an a&s;&s;urance of being rejected, when they &s;hall again &s;eek the &s;ame Honor. And tho this may &s;eem a &s;mall matter to tho&s;e who fear to do ill
<PB N="411" REF="419">
only from a &s;en&s;e of the pains inflicted; yet it is very terrible to men of   ingenuous &s;pirits, as they are &s;uppos'd to be who are accounted fit to be entru&s;ted with &s;o great Powers. But why it &s;hould be call'd <HI>Liberty with a mi&s;chief</HI> if it were otherwi&s;e; or how the liberty of particular Societys would be greater, if they might do what they pleas'd, than whil&s;t they &s;end others to act for them, &s;uch wi&s;e men only as <HI>Filmer</HI> can tell us. For as no man, or number of men, can give a Power which he or they have not, the <HI>Achaians, Etolians, Latins, Samnites</HI> and <HI>Tu&s;cans,</HI> who tran&s;acted all things relating to their A&s;&s;ociations by Delegates; and the <HI>Athenians, Carthaginians</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> who kept the power of the State in them&s;elves, were all equally free. And in our days the Uni|ted Provinces of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> the <HI>Switzers</HI> and <HI>Gri&s;ons,</HI> who are of the fir&s;t &s;ort, and the <HI>Venetians, Genoe&s;es,</HI> and <HI>Lucche&s;es,</HI> who are of the other, are &s;o al&s;o. All men that have any degree of common &s;en&s;e, plainly &s;ee, that the Liberty of tho&s;e who act in their own per&s;ons, and of tho&s;e who &s;end Delegates, is perfectly the &s;ame, and the exerci&s;e is, and can only be chang'd by their con&s;ent.</P>
<P>But whatever the Law or Cu&s;tom of <HI>England</HI> be in this point, it can|not concern our que&s;tion. The general propo&s;ition concerning a Patriar|chical Power cannot be prov'd by a &s;ingle example. If there be a gene|ral Power every where, forbidding Nations to give in&s;tructions to their Delegates, they can do it no where. If there be no &s;uch thing, every People may do it, unle&s;s they have depriv'd them&s;elves of their right, all being born under the &s;ame condition. 'Tis to no purpo&s;e to &s;ay that the Nations before mention'd had not Kings, and therefore might act as they did. For if the general The&s;is be true, they mu&s;t have Kings; and if it be not, none are oblig'd to have them, unle&s;s they think fit, and the Kings they make are their Creatures. But many of the&s;e Nati|ons had either Kings, or other Magi&s;trats in power like to them. The Provinces of the <HI>Netherlands</HI> had Dukes, Earls, or Marque&s;&s;es: <HI>Genoa</HI> and <HI>Venice</HI> have Dukes. If any on account of the narrowne&s;s of their Territorys have ab&s;tain'd from the Name, it dos not alter the ca&s;e; for our di&s;pute is not concerning the Name, but the Right. If that one Man, who is in the principal Magi&s;tracy of every Nation, mu&s;t be re|puted the Father of that People, and has a Power which may not be li|mited by any Law, it imports not what he is call'd. But if in &s;mall Territorys he may be limited by Laws, he may be &s;o al&s;o in the greate&s;t. The lea&s;t of men is a man as well as a Giant: And tho&s;e in the <HI>We&s;t-Indys</HI> who have not above twenty or thirty Subjects able to bear Arms, are Kings as well as <HI>Xerxes.</HI> Every Nation may divide it &s;elf into &s;mall parcels as &s;ome have done, by the &s;ame Law they have re&s;train'd or abo|li&s;h'd their Kings, join'd to one another, or taken their hazard of &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting by them&s;elves; acted by delegation, or retaining the Power in their own per&s;ons; given finite or indefinite Powers; re&s;erv'd to them|&s;elves a power of puni&s;hing tho&s;e who &s;hould depart from their duty, or refer'd it to their General A&s;&s;emblys. And that Liberty, for which we contend as the Gift of God and Nature, remains equally to all.</P>
<P>If men who delight in cavilling &s;hould &s;ay, that great Kingdoms are not to be regulated by the Examples of &s;mall States, I de&s;ire to know when it was, that God ordain'd great Nations &s;hould be Slaves, and de|priv'd of all right to di&s;po&s;e matters relating to their Government; whil&s;t he left to &s;uch as had, or &s;hould divide them&s;elves into &s;mall parcels, a right of making &s;uch Con&s;titutions as were mo&s;t convenient for them.
<PB N="412" REF="420">
  When this is re&s;olv'd, we ought to be inform'd, what extent of Terri|tory is requir'd to de&s;erve the name of a great Kingdom. <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>France</HI> are e&s;teem'd great, and yet the Deputys or <HI>Procuradores</HI> of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Vida de Car|los 5^0 de San|doval.</NOTE>&s;everal parts of <HI>Ca&s;tille</HI> did in the <HI>Cortez</HI> held at <HI>Madrid,</HI> in the beginning of <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth's reign, excu&s;e them&s;elves from giving the &s;upplys he de&s;ir'd, becau&s;e they had receiv'd no orders in that particular from the Towns that &s;ent them; and afterwards receiving expre&s;s orders not to do it, they gave his Maje&s;ty a flat denial. The like was frequently done du|ring the reigns of that great Prince, and of his Son <HI>Philip</HI> the &s;econd. And generally tho&s;e <HI>Procuradores</HI> never granted any thing of importance to either of them, without particular Orders from their Principals. The &s;ame way was taken in <HI>France,</HI> as long as there were any General A&s;&s;em|blys of E&s;tates; and if it dos not &s;till continue, 'tis becau&s;e there are none. For no man who under&s;tood the Affairs of that Kingdom, did ever deny, that the Deputys were oblig'd to follow the Orders of tho&s;e who &s;ent them. And perhaps, if men would examin by what means they came to be aboli&s;h'd, they might find, that the Cardinals <HI>de Riche|lieu</HI> and <HI>Mazarin,</HI> with other Mini&s;ters who have accompli&s;h'd that work, were acted by &s;ome other principle than that of Ju&s;tice, or the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Laws of God and Nature. In the General A&s;&s;em|bly of E&s;tates held at <HI>Blois</HI> in the time of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, <HI>Bodin</HI> then <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;t. Thuan.</NOTE>Deputy for the third E&s;tate of <HI>Vermandois,</HI> by their particular Order, propos'd &s;o many things as took up a great part of their time. Other Deputys alledg'd no other rea&s;on for many things &s;aid and done by them, highly contrary to the King's will, than that they were commanded &s;o to do by their Superiors. The&s;e General A&s;&s;emblys being laid a&s;ide, the &s;ame cu&s;tom is &s;till us'd in the le&s;&s;er A&s;&s;emblys of E&s;tates in <HI>Languedoc</HI> and <HI>Britany.</HI> The Deputys cannot without the infamy of betraying their Tru&s;t, and fear of puni&s;hment, recede from the Orders given by their Principals; and yet we do not find that <HI>Liberty with a mi&s;chief</HI> is much more predominant in <HI>France</HI> than among&s;t us. The &s;ame method is every day practis'd in the Diets of <HI>Germany.</HI> The Princes and great Lords, who have their places in their own right, may do what they plea&s;e; but the Deputys of the Citys mu&s;t follow &s;uch Orders as they receive. The Hi&s;torys of <HI>Denmark, Sweden, Poland</HI> and <HI>Bohemia,</HI> te&s;tify the &s;ame thing: and if this <HI>Liberty with a mi&s;chief</HI> dos not &s;till continue intire in all tho&s;e places, it has bin dimini&s;h'd by &s;uch means as &s;ute better with the manners of Pirats, than the Laws of God and Nature. If <HI>England</HI> therefore dos not &s;till enjoy the &s;ame, we mu&s;t have bin depriv'd of it either by &s;uch unju&s;tifiable means, or by our own con&s;ent. But thanks be to God, we know no People who have a better right to Liberty, or have better defended it than our own Nation. And if we do not dege|nerate from the Vertue of our Ance&s;tors, we may hope to tran&s;mit it intire to our Po&s;terity. We always may, and often do give In&s;tructions to our Delegates; but the le&s;s we fetter them, the more we manife&s;t our own Rights: for tho&s;e who have only a limited Power, mu&s;t limit that which they give; but they that can give an unlimited Power mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have it in them&s;elves. The great Trea&s;urer <HI>Burleigh</HI> &s;aid, the Parliament could do any thing but turn a Man into a Woman. Sir <HI>Thomas Moor,</HI> when <HI>Rich</HI> Solicitor to K. <HI>Henry</HI> the 8<HI>th</HI> ask'd him, if the Parliament might not make <HI>R. Rich</HI> King, &s;aid, that was <HI>ca&s;us levis,</HI> taking it for granted that they might make or unmake whom they pleas'd. The fir&s;t part of this, which includes the other, is a&s;&s;erted by the Statute of the
<PB N="413" REF="421">
13<HI>th</HI> of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> denouncing the mo&s;t grievous puni&s;hments again&s;t   all &s;uch as &s;hould dare to contradict it. But if it be in the Parliament, it mu&s;t be in tho&s;e who give to Parliament-men the powers by which they act; for before they are cho&s;en they have none, and can never have any if tho&s;e that &s;end them had it not in them&s;elves. They cannot receive it from the Magi&s;trate, for that power which he has is deriv'd from the &s;ame &s;pring. The power of making and unmaking him cannot be from him&s;elf; for he that is not, can do nothing, and when he is made can have no other power than is confer'd upon him by tho&s;e that make him. Be&s;ides, he who departs from his duty de&s;ires to avoid the puni&s;hment, the power therefore of puni&s;hing him is not from him&s;elf. It cannot be from the Hou&s;e of Peers as it is con&s;tituted, for they act for them&s;elves, and are cho&s;en by Kings: and 'tis ab&s;urd to think that Kings, who gene|rally abhor all re&s;triction of their Power, &s;hould give that to others by which they might be unmade. If one or more Princes relying upon their own Vertue and Re&s;olutions to do good, had given &s;uch a power again&s;t them&s;elves, as <HI>Trajan</HI> did, when he commanded the Prefect to u&s;e the Sword for him if he govern'd well, and again&s;t him if he govern'd ill, it would &s;oon have bin re&s;cinded by their Succe&s;&s;ors. If our <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t had made &s;uch a Law, his leud Son would have aboli&s;h'd it, before he would have &s;uffer'd him&s;elf to be impri&s;on'd and depos'd by it. He would never have acknowledg'd his unworthine&s;s to reign, if he had bin ty'd to no other Law than his own will, for he could not tran&s;gre&s;s that; nor have own'd the mercy of the Parliament in &s;paring his Life, if they had acted only by a power which he had confer'd upon them. This Power mu&s;t therefore be in tho&s;e who act by a delegated Power, and none can give it to their Delegates but they who have it in them&s;elves. The mo&s;t certain te&s;timony that can be given of their unlimited Power is, that they rely upon the Wi&s;dom and Fidelity of their Deputys, &s;o as to lay no re&s;trictions upon them: they may do what they plea&s;e, if they take care <HI>ne quid detrimenti Re&s;publica accipiat, that the Commonwealth receives no detriment.</HI> This is a Commi&s;&s;ion fit to be granted by wi&s;e and good men, to tho&s;e they chu&s;e thro an opinion that they are &s;o al&s;o, and that they cannot bring any prejudice upon the Nation, that will not fall upon them&s;elves and their po&s;terity. This is al&s;o fit to be receiv'd by tho&s;e, who &s;eeking nothing but that which is ju&s;t in it &s;elf, and profitable to their Country, cannot fore&s;ee what will be propos'd when they are all met together; much le&s;s re&s;olve how to vote till they hear the rea&s;ons on both &s;ides. The Electors mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be in the &s;ame ignorance; and that Law which &s;hould oblige them to give particular Orders to their Knights and Burge&s;&s;es in relation to every Vote, would make the deci&s;ion of the mo&s;t important Affairs to depend upon the judgment of tho&s;e who know nothing of the matters in que&s;tion, and by that means ca&s;t the Nation into the utmo&s;t danger of the mo&s;t inextricable confu&s;ion. This can never be the intention of that Law which is <HI>Sanctio recta,</HI> and &s;eeks only the good of tho&s;e that live under it.

If no men could have a Power of making Laws, none could ever have bin made; for all that are or have bin in the World, except tho&s;e given by God to the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> were made by them; that is, they have exercis'd an Arbitrary Power in making that to be Law which was not, or annulling that which was. The various Laws and Governments, that are or have bin in &s;everal Ages and Places, are the product of various opinions in tho&s;e who had the power of making them. This mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be, unle&s;s a general Rule be &s;et to all; for the Judgments of men will vary if they are left to their li|berty, and the variety that is found among them, &s;hews they are &s;ubject to no Rule but that of their own Rea&s;on, by which they &s;ee what is fit to be embrac'd or avoided, according to the &s;everal circum&s;tances under which they live. The Authority that judges of the&s;e circum&s;tances is ar|bitrary, and the Legi&s;lators &s;hew them&s;elves to be more or le&s;s wi&s;e and good, as they do rightly or not rightly exerci&s;e this Power. The diffe|rence therefore between good and ill Governments is not, that tho&s;e of one &s;ort have an Arbitrary Power which the others have not, for they all have it; but that tho&s;e which are well con&s;tituted, place this Power &s;o as it may be beneficial to the People, and &s;et &s;uch Rules as are hardly to be tran&s;gre&s;t; whil&s;t tho&s;e of the other &s;ort fail in one or both the&s;e points. Some al&s;o thro want of courage, fortune, or &s;trength, may have bin op|pre&s;t by the violence of Strangers, or &s;uffer'd a corrupt Party to ri&s;e up within them&s;elves, and by force or fraud to u&s;urp a Power of impo&s;ing what they pleas'd. Others being &s;otti&s;h, cowardly and ba&s;e, have &s;o far err'd in the Foundations, as to give up them&s;elves to the will of one or few men, who turning all to their own profit or plea&s;ure, have bin ju&s;t in nothing but in u&s;ing &s;uch a People like bea&s;ts. Some have plac'd weak defences again&s;t the lu&s;ts of tho&s;e they have advanc'd to the highe&s;t places, and given them opportunitys of arrogating more power to them&s;elves than the Law allows. Where any of the&s;e errors are committed, the Go|vernment may be ea&s;y for a while, or at lea&s;t tolerable, whil&s;t it conti|nues uncorrupted, but it cannot be la&s;ting. When the Law may be ea&s;i|ly or &s;afely overthrown, it will be attempted. Whatever vertue may be in the fir&s;t Magi&s;trats, many years will not pa&s;s before they come to be corrupted; and their Succe&s;&s;ors deflecting from their integrity, will &s;eize upon the ill-guarded prey. They will then not only govern by will, but by that irregular will, which turns the Law, that was made for the publick
<PB N="415" REF="423">
good, to the private advantage of one or few men. 'Tis not my inten|tion   to enumerate the &s;everal ways that have bin taken to effect this; or to &s;hew what Governments have deflected from the right, and how far. But I think I may ju&s;tly &s;ay, that an Arbitrary Power was never well plac'd in any men and their Succe&s;&s;ors, who were not oblig'd to obey the Laws they &s;hould make. This was well under&s;tood by our <HI>Saxon</HI> Ance&s;tors: They made Laws in their A&s;&s;emblys and Councils of the Na|tion; but all tho&s;e who propos'd or a&s;&s;ented to tho&s;e Laws, as &s;oon as the A&s;&s;embly was di&s;&s;olv'd, were comprehended under the power of them as well as other men. They could do nothing to the prejudice of the Na|tion, that would not be as hurtful to tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent and their po&s;terity, as to tho&s;e who by many accidents might be ab&s;ent. The <HI>Nor|mans</HI> enter'd into, and continu'd in the &s;ame path. Our Parliaments at this day are in the &s;ame condition. They may make prejudicial Wars, ignominious Treatys, and unju&s;t Laws: yet when the Se&s;&s;ion is ended, they mu&s;t bear the burden as much as others; and when they dy, <HI>the teeth of their Children will be &s;et an edg with the &s;our Grapes they have eaten.</HI> But 'tis hard to delude or corrupt &s;o many: Men do not in matters of the highe&s;t importance yield to &s;light temptations. No man &s;erves the Devil for nothing: Small wages will not content tho&s;e who expo&s;e them|&s;elves to perpetual infamy, and the hatred of a Nation for betraying their Country. Our Kings had not wherewithal to corrupt many till the&s;e la&s;t twenty years, and the treachery of a few was not enough to pa&s;s a Law. The union of many was not ea&s;ily wrought, and there was no|thing to tempt them to endeavour it; for they could make little ad|vantage during the Se&s;&s;ion, and were to be lo&s;t in the ma&s;s of the Peo|ple, and prejudic'd by their own Laws, as &s;oon as it was ended. They could not in a &s;hort time reconcile their various intere&s;ts or pa&s;&s;ions, &s;o as to combine together again&s;t the Publick; and the former Kings never went about it. We are beholden to <HI>H-de, Cl-ff-rd</HI> and <HI>D-nby,</HI> for all that has bin done of that kind. They found a Parliament full of leud young men cho&s;en by a furious People in &s;pite to the Puritans, who&s;e &s;everity had di&s;ta&s;ted them. The weake&s;t of all Mini&s;ters had wit e|nough to under&s;tand that &s;uch as the&s;e might be ea&s;ily deluded, cor|rupted, or brib'd. Some were fond of their Seats in Parliament, and delighted to domineer over their Neighbors by continuing in them: Others prefer'd the cajolerys of the Court before the honor of perform|ing their duty to the Country that employ'd them. Some &s;ought to re|lieve their ruin'd Fortunes, and were mo&s;t forward to give the King a va&s;t Revenue, that from thence they might receive Pen&s;ions: others were glad of a temporary Protection again&s;t their Creditors. Many knew not what they did when they annul'd the Triennial Act, voted the Mili|tia to be in the King, gave him the Exci&s;e, Cu&s;toms and Chimny-mony, made the Act for Corporations, by which the greate&s;t part of the Na|tion was brought under the power of the wor&s;t men in it; drunk or &s;o|ber pa&s;s'd the Five-mile Act, and that for Uniformity in the Church. This embolden'd the Court to think of making Parliaments to be the in&s;tru|ments of our Slavery, which had in all Ages pa&s;t bin the firme&s;t pillars of our Liberty. There might have bin perhaps a po&s;&s;ibility of pre|venting this pernicious mi&s;chief in the Con&s;titution of our Government. But our brave Ante&s;tors could never think their Po&s;terity would dege|nerate into &s;uch ba&s;ene&s;s to &s;ell them&s;elves and their Country: yet how great &s;oever the danger may be, 'tis le&s;s than to put all into the hands of
<PB N="416" REF="424">
  one Man and his Mini&s;ters: the hazard of being ruin'd by tho&s;e who mu&s;t peri&s;h with us, is not &s;o much to be fear'd, as by one who may enrich and &s;trengthen him&s;elf by our de&s;truction. 'Tis better to depend upon tho&s;e who are under a po&s;&s;ibility of being again corrupted, than upon one who applys him&s;elf to corrupt them, becau&s;e he cannot otherwi&s;e ac|compli&s;h his de&s;igns. It were to be wi&s;h'd that our &s;ecurity were more certain; but this being, under God, the be&s;t Anchor we have, it de&s;erves to be pre&s;erv'd with all care, till one of a more unque&s;tionable &s;trength be fram'd by the con&s;ent of the Nation.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XLVI. The coercive power of the Law proceeds from the Authority of Parliament.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING prov'd that Proclamations are not Laws, and that the Legi&s;lative Power, which is arbitrary, is tru&s;ted only in the hands of tho&s;e who are bound to obey the Laws that are made, 'tis not hard to di&s;cover what it is that gives the power of Law to the Sanctions under which we live. Our Author tells us, That <HI>all Statutes or Laws are made properly by the King alone, at the Rogation of the People, as his Maje&s;ty King</HI> James <HI>of happy Memory affirms in his true Law of Free Monarchy; and as</HI> Hooker <HI>teaches us, That Laws do not take their con&s;training power from the quality of &s;uch as devi&s;e them, but from the power that gives them the &s;trength of Law.</HI> But if the Rogation of the People be nece&s;&s;ary, that cannot be a Law which proceeds not from their Rogation: the power therefore is not alone in the King; for a mo&s;t important part is confe&s;t to be in the People. And as none could be in them, if our Author's Propo|&s;ition, or the Principles upon which it is grounded, were true, the acknow|ledgment of &s;uch a part to be in the People &s;hews them to be fal&s;e. For if the King had all in him&s;elf, none could participate with him: if any do participate, he has not all; and 'tis from that Law by which they do participate, that we are to know what part is left to him. The preambles of mo&s;t Acts of Parliament manife&s;t this by the words, <HI>Be it enacted by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons in Parliament a&s;&s;embled, and by Authority of the &s;ame.</HI> But <HI>King</HI> James, &s;ays <HI>Filmer, in his Law of Free Monarchy affirms the contrary;</HI> and it may be &s;o, yet that is nothing to us. No man doubts that he de&s;ir'd it might be &s;o in <HI>England:</HI> but it dos not from thence appear that it is &s;o. The Law of a Free Monarchy is nothing to us; for that Monarchy is not free which is regulated by a Law not to be broken without the guilt of Perjury, as he him&s;elf <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Speech in Star-Chamber, <HI>1616.</HI></NOTE>confe&s;t in relation to ours. As to the words cited from <HI>Hooker,</HI> I can find no hurt in them. To draw up the form of a good Law, is a matter of invention and jugdment, but it receives the force of a Law from the Power that enacts it. We have no other rea&s;on for the payment of Exci&s;e or Cu&s;toms, than that the Parliament has granted tho&s;e Revenues to the King to defray the publick Charges. Whatever therefore King <HI>James</HI> was pleas'd to &s;ay in his Books, or in tho&s;e written for him, we do not &s;o much as know that the killing of a King is Trea&s;on, or to be puni&s;h'd with death, otherwi&s;e than as it is enacted by Parliament; and it was not always &s;o: for in the time

It had bin in vain for a King to &s;ay he would have it otherwi&s;e; for he is not created to make Laws, but to govern according to &s;uch as are made, and &s;worn to a&s;&s;ent to <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Quas vulgus elegerit.</NOTE><HI>&s;uch as &s;hall be propos'd.</HI> He who thinks the Crown not worth accepting on the&s;e conditions, may refu&s;e it. The words <HI>Le Roy le veut,</HI> are only a pattern of the <HI>French</HI> fa&s;hions, upon which &s;ome Kings have laid gre&s;s &s;tre&s;s, and would no doubt have bin glad to intro|duce <HI>Car tel e&s;t notre plai&s;ir;</HI> but that may prove a difficult matter. Nay in <HI>France</HI> it &s;elf, where that Stile, and all the ranting expre&s;&s;ions that plea&s;e the vaine&s;t of men are in mode, no Edict has the power of a Law, till it be regi&s;ter'd in Parliament. This is not a mere ceremony, as &s;ome pre|tend, but all that is e&s;&s;ential to a Law. Nothing has bin more common than for tho&s;e Parliaments to refu&s;e Edicts &s;ent to them by the King. When <HI>John Cha&s;tel</HI> had, at the in&s;tigation of the Je&s;uits, &s;tab'd <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth in the Mouth, and that Order had de&s;ign'd or executed many other execrable crimes, they were bani&s;h'd out of the Kingdom by an Arre&s;t of the Parliament of <HI>Paris.</HI> Some other Parliaments regi&s;ter'd the &s;ame; but tho&s;e of <HI>Tholou&s;e</HI> and <HI>Bordeaux</HI> ab&s;olutely refus'd, and notwith|&s;tanding all the King could do, the Je&s;uits continu'd at <HI>Tournon</HI> and many other places within their Precincts, till the Arre&s;t was revok'd. The&s;e proceedings are &s;o di&s;plea&s;ing to the Court, that the mo&s;t violent ways have bin often us'd to aboli&s;h them. About the year 1650, <HI>Seguier</HI> then Chan|cellor <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mem. de L. R. F.</NOTE>of <HI>France</HI> was &s;ent with a great number of Soldiers to oblige the Par|liament of <HI>Paris</HI> to pa&s;s &s;ome Edicts upon which they had he&s;itated; but he was &s;o far from accompli&s;hing his de&s;ign, that the People ro&s;e again&s;t him, and he thought him&s;elf happy that he e&s;cap'd with his Life. If the Parliaments do not in all parts of the Kingdom continue in the Liberty of approving or rejecting all Edicts, the Law is not alter'd, but oppre&s;t by the violence of the Sword: And the Prince of <HI>Cond&eacute;,</HI> who was princi|pally employ'd to do that work, may, I &s;uppo&s;e, have had lei&s;ure to reflect on tho&s;e Actions, and cannot but find rea&s;on to conclude, that his excel|lent valor and conduct was us'd in a mo&s;t noble Exploit, equally benefi|cial to his Country and him&s;elf. However, tho&s;e who are skill'd in the Laws of that Nation do &s;till affirm, that all publick Acts which are not du|ly examin'd and regi&s;ter'd, are void in them&s;elves, and can be of no force longer than the mi&s;erable People lies under the violence of Oppre&s;&s;ion; which is all that could rea&s;onably be &s;aid, if a Pirat had the &s;ame power over them. But whether the <HI>French</HI> have willingly offer'd their ears to be bor'd, or have bin &s;ubdu'd by force, it concerns us not. Our Libertys depend not upon their will, vertue, or fortune: how wretched and &s;hame|ful &s;oever their Slavery may be, the evil is only to them&s;elves. We are to con&s;ider no human Laws but our own; and if we have the &s;pirit of our Ance&s;tors we &s;hall maintain them, and dy as free as they left us. <HI>Le Roy le veut,</HI> tho written in great Letters, or pronounc'd in the mo&s;t tragical manner, can &s;ignify no more than that the King in performance of his Oath dos a&s;&s;ent to &s;uch Laws as the Lords and Commons have agreed. Without prejudice to them&s;elves and their Libertys, a People may &s;uffer the King to advi&s;e with his Council upon what they propo&s;e.
<PB N="418" REF="426">
  Two eyes &s;ee more than one, and human judgment is &s;ubject to errors. Tho the Parliament con&s;i&s;ts of the mo&s;t eminent men of the Nation, yet when they intend good, they may be mi&s;taken. They may &s;afely put a check upon them&s;elves, that they may farther con&s;ider the mo&s;t impor|tant matters, and correct the errors that may have bin committed, if the King's Council do di&s;cover them: but he can &s;peak only by the advice of his Council; and every man of them is with his head to an&s;wer for the ad|vice he gives. If the Parliament has not bin &s;atisfy'd with the rea&s;ons given again&s;t any Law that they offer'd, it has frequently pa&s;s'd; and if they have bin &s;atisfy'd, 'twas not the King, but they that laid it a&s;ide. He that is of another opinion, may try whether <HI>Le Roy le veut</HI> can give the force of a Law to any thing conceiv'd by the King, his Council, or any other than the Parliament. But if no wi&s;e man will affirm that he can do it, or deny that by his Oath he is oblig'd to a&s;&s;ent to tho&s;e that come from them, he can neither have the Legi&s;lative power in him&s;elf, nor any other part in it than what is formal, and nece&s;&s;arily to be perform'd by him, as the Law pre&s;cribes.</P>
<P>I know not what our Author means by &s;aying, <HI>Le Roy le veut is the in|terpretative phra&s;e pronounc'd at the pa&s;&s;ing of every Act of Parliament:</HI> For if there be difficulty in any of them, tho&s;e words do no way remove it. But the following part of the paragraph better de&s;erves to be ob&s;erv'd. <HI>It was,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>the antient cu&s;tom for a long time until the days of</HI> Henry <HI>the Fifth, for the Kings when any Bill was brought to them that had pa&s;s'd both Hou&s;es, to take and pick out what they lik'd not; and &s;o much as they cho&s;e was enacted as a Law: But the cu&s;tom of the latter Kings has bin &s;o gracious, as to allow al|ways of the intire Bill as it pa&s;s'd both Hou&s;es.</HI> He judiciou&s;ly ob&s;erves when our Kings began to be gracious, and we to be free. That King (except|ing the per&s;ecution for Religion in his time, which is rather to be imputed to the ignorance of that Age, than to any evil in his own nature) govern'd well; and as all Princes who have bin vertuous and brave have always de|&s;ir'd to pre&s;erve their Subjects Liberty, which they knew to be the mo|ther and nur&s;e of their Valor, fitting them for great and generous Enter|prizes, his care was to plea&s;e them, and to rai&s;e their Spirits. But about the &s;ame time, tho&s;e dete&s;table Arts by which the mix'd Monarchys in this part of the world have bin every where terribly &s;haken, and in many places totally overthrown, began to be practis'd. <HI>Charles</HI> the Seventh of <HI>France,</HI> under pretence of carrying on a War again&s;t him and his Son, took upon him to rai&s;e Mony by his own Authority, and we know how well that method has bin pur&s;u'd. The mi&s;chievous &s;agacity of his Son <HI>Lewis</HI> the 11<HI>th,</HI> which is now call'd <HI>King-Craft,</HI> was wholly exerted in the &s;ub|ver&s;ion of the Laws of <HI>France,</HI> and the Nobility that &s;upported them. His Succe&s;&s;ors, except only <HI>Lewis</HI> the 12<HI>th,</HI> follow'd his example; and in other Nations, <HI>Ferdinand</HI> of <HI>Arragon, James</HI> the Third of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh of <HI>England,</HI> were thought to imitate him the mo&s;t. Tho we have little rea&s;on to commend all the Princes that preceded <HI>Henry</HI> the Fifth; yet I am inclin'd to date the general impairing of our Government from the death of that King, and his valiant Brothers. His weak Son became a prey to a furious <HI>French</HI> Woman, who brought the Maxims of her own Country into ours, and advano'd the wor&s;t of Villains to govern according to them. The&s;e mea&s;ures were pur&s;u'd by <HI>Edward</HI> the 4<HI>th,</HI> who&s;e wants contracted by prodigality and debauchery, were to be &s;upply'd by fraud and rapine. The ambition, cruelty and perfidiou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Richard</HI> the 3<HI>d;</HI> the covetou&s;ne&s;s and malicious &s;ubtilty of <HI>Henry</HI> the 7<HI>th;</HI> the violent lu&s;t, rage and pride of
<PB N="419" REF="427">
<HI>Henry</HI> the 8<HI>th,</HI> and the bigotted fury of Q. <HI>Mary,</HI> in&s;tigated by the craft and   malice of <HI>Spain,</HI> per&s;uaded me to believe that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liberty did not re|ceive birth or growth from the favor and goodne&s;s of their gracious Prin|ces. But it &s;eems all this is mi&s;taken; <HI>Henry</HI> the 6<HI>th</HI> was wi&s;e, valiant, and no way guided by his Wife; <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth continent, &s;ober, and contented with what the Nation gave him; <HI>Richard</HI> the third mild, gen|tle and faithful; <HI>Henry</HI> the 7<HI>th</HI> &s;incere, and &s;atisfy'd with his own; <HI>Henry</HI> the 8<HI>th</HI> humble, temperate and ju&s;t; and Queen <HI>Mary</HI> a friend to our Country and Religion. No le&s;s prai&s;es &s;ure can be due to tho&s;e who were &s;o gracious to recede from their own right of picking what they pleas'd out of our Laws, and to leave them intirely to us as they pa&s;s'd both Hou|&s;es. We are beholden to our Author for the di&s;covery of the&s;e my&s;te|rys: but tho he &s;eems to have taken an Oath like that of the Gyp&s;ys when they enter into that vertuous Society, never to &s;peak one word of truth, he is not &s;o &s;ubtle in concealing his Lies. All Kings were tru&s;ted with the publication of the Laws, but all Kings did not fal&s;ify them. Such as were not wicked and vicious, or &s;o weak as to be made &s;ub&s;ervi|ent to the malice of their Mini&s;ters and Flatterers, could never be drawn into the guilt of &s;o infamous a cheat, directly contrary to the Oath of their Coronation. They &s;wear to pa&s;s &s;uch <HI>Laws</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quas vulgus elegerit.</NOTE><HI>as the People chu&s;e;</HI> but if we will believe our Author, they might have pick'd out whatever they pleas'd, and fal&s;ly impos'd upon the Nation, as a Law made by the Lords and Commons, that which they had model'd according to their own will, and made to be different from, or contrary to the intention of the Parliament. The King's part in this fraud (of which he boa&s;ts) was little more than might have bin done by the Speaker or his Clerks. They might have fal&s;ify'd an Act as well as the King, tho they could not &s;o well pre&s;erve them&s;elves from puni&s;hment. 'Tis no wonder if for a while no &s;top was put to &s;uch an abominable Cu&s;tom. 'Twas hard to think a King would be guilty of a fraud, that were infamous in a Slave: But that prov'd to be a &s;mall &s;ecurity, when the wor&s;t of Slaves came to govern them. Neverthele&s;s 'tis probable they proceeded cautiou&s;ly: the fir&s;t alterations were perhaps innocent, or, it may be, for the be&s;t. But when they had once found out the way, they &s;tuck at nothing that &s;eem'd for their purpo&s;e. This was like the plague of Lepro&s;y, that could not be cur'd; the hou&s;e infected was to be demoli&s;h'd; the poi&s;onous plant mu&s;t be torn up by the root; the tru&s;t that had bin broken was to be aboli&s;h'd; they who had perverted or fru&s;trated the Law, were no longer to be &s;uffer'd to make the lea&s;t alteration; and that brave Prince readily join'd with his People to extingui&s;h the mi&s;chievous abu&s;e that had bin introduc'd by &s;ome of his worthle&s;s Predece&s;&s;ors. The wor&s;t and ba&s;e&s;t of them had continual di&s;putes with their Parliaments, and thought that whatever they could detract from the Liberty of the Nation, would &s;erve to advance their Prerogative. They delighted in frauds, and would have no other Mini&s;ters but &s;uch as would be the in&s;truments of them. Since their Word could not be made to pa&s;s for a Law, they indeavor'd to impo&s;e their own or their Servants inventions as Acts of Parliament, upon the de|luded people, and to make the be&s;t of them &s;ub&s;ervient to their corrupt Ends and pernicious Coun&s;els. This, if it had continu'd, might have overthrown all our Rights, and depriv'd us of all that men can call good in the world. But the Providence of God furni&s;h'd our Ance&s;tors with an
<PB N="420" REF="428">
  opportunity of providing again&s;t &s;o great, &s;o univer&s;al a mi&s;chief. They had a wi&s;e and valiant Prince, who &s;corn'd to encroach upon the Libertys of his Subjects, and abhor'd the dete&s;table Arts by which they had bin impair'd. He e&s;teem'd their courage, &s;trength, and love, to be his great|e&s;t Advantage, Riches and Glory. He aim'd at the conque&s;t of <HI>France,</HI> which was only to be effected by the bravery of a free and well &s;atisfy'd People. Slaves will always be cowards, and enemys to their Ma&s;ter: By bringing his Subjects into that condition, he mu&s;t infallibly have ruin'd his own de&s;igns, and made them unfit to fight either for him or them&s;elves. He de&s;ir'd not only that his People &s;hould be free during his time, but that his Succe&s;&s;ors &s;hould not be able by oblique and fraudulent ways to en&s;lave them. If it be a reproach to us that Women have reign'd over us, 'tis much more to the Princes that &s;ucceeded our <HI>Henry,</HI> that none of them did &s;o much imitate him in his Government as Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> She did not go about to mangle Acts of Parliament, and to pick out what might &s;erve her turn, but frequently pa&s;s'd forty of fifty in a Se&s;&s;ion, without reading one of them. She knew that &s;he did not reign for her &s;elf, but for her People; that what was good for them, was either good for her, or that her good ought not to come into competition with that of the whole Nation; and that &s;he was by Oath oblig'd to pa&s;s &s;uch Laws as were pre&s;ented to her on their behalf. This not only &s;hews that there is no &s;uch thing as a Legi&s;lative Power plac'd in Kings by the Laws of God and Nature, but that Nations have it in them&s;elves. It was not by Law nor by Right, but by U&s;urpation, Fraud and Perjury, that &s;ome Kings took upon them to pick what they pleas'd out of the publick Acts. <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth did not grant us the right of making our own Laws; but with his approbation we aboli&s;h'd a dete&s;table abu&s;e that might have prov'd fatal to us. And if we examin our Hi&s;tory we &s;hall find, that every good and generous Prince has &s;ought to e&s;tabli&s;h our Libertys, as much as the mo&s;t ba&s;e and wicked to infringe them. *</P>

<HEAD>The COPY of a PAPER Deliver'd to the SHERIFFS, Upon the Scaffold on <HI>Tower-hill,</HI> On Friday <HI>Decemb.</HI> 7. 1683. BY Algernon Sidney <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Immediately before his Death. Men, Brethren, and Fathers; Friends, Countrymen, and Strangers:</HEAD>
<P>IT May be expected that I &s;hould now &s;ay &s;ome great matters unto you; but the Rigor of the Sea&s;on, and the Infirmitys of my Age, increas'd by a clo&s;e Impri&s;onment of above five Months, do not permit me.</P>
<P>Moreover, we live in an Age that makes Truth pa&s;s for Trea&s;on: I dare not &s;ay any thing contrary unto it, and the Ears of tho&s;e that are about me will probably be found too tender to hear it. My Trial and Condemnation doth &s;ufficiently evidence this.</P>
<P><HI>We&s;t, Rum&s;ey,</HI> and <HI>Keyling,</HI> who were brought to prove the Plot, &s;aid no more of me, than that they knew me not; and &s;ome others equally un|known to me, had us'd my Name, and that of &s;ome others, to give a little Reputation to their De&s;igns. The Lord <HI>Howard</HI> is too infamous by his Life, and the many Perjurys not to be deny'd, or rather &s;worn by him|&s;elf,
<PB N="422" REF="430">
to de&s;erve mention; and being a &s;ingle Witne&s;s would be of no value, tho he had been of unblemi&s;h'd Credit, or had not &s;een and confe&s;s'd that the Crimes committed by him would be pardon'd only for committing more; and even the Pardon promis'd could not be obtain'd till the drudgery of Swearing was over.</P>
<P>This being laid a&s;ide, the whole matter is reduc'd to the Papers &s;aid to be found in my Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t by the King's Officers, without any other Proof of their being written by me, than what is taken from &s;uppo&s;itions upon the &s;imilitude of an Hand that is ea&s;ily counterfeited, and which hath been lately declar'd in the Lady <HI>Car</HI>'s Ca&s;e to be no lawful Evidence in Criminal Cau&s;es.</P>
<P>But if I had been &s;een to write them, the matter would not be much alter'd. They plainly appear to relate to a large Treati&s;e written long &s;ince in An&s;wer to <HI>Filmer</HI>'s Book, which by all Intelligent Men is thought to be grounded upon wicked Principles, equally pernicious to Magi|&s;trates and People.</P>
<P>If he might publi&s;h to the World his Opinion, That all Men are born under a nece&s;&s;ity deriv'd from the Laws of God and Nature, to &s;ubmit to an Ab&s;olute Kingly Government, which could be re&s;train'd by no Law, or Oath; and that he that has the Power, whether he came to it by Creation, Election, Inheritance, U&s;urpation, or any other way, had the Right; and none mu&s;t oppo&s;e his Will, but the Per|&s;ons and E&s;tates of his Subjects mu&s;t be indi&s;pen&s;ably &s;ubject unto it; I know not why I might not have publi&s;h'd my Opinion to the contrary, without the breach of any Law I have yet known.</P>
<P>I might as freely as he, publickly have declar'd my Thought, and the rea&s;ons upon which they were grounded, and I per&s;uaded to believe, That God had left Nations to the Liberty of &s;etting up &s;uch Govern|ments as be&s;t pleas'd them&s;elves.</P>
<P>That Magi&s;trates were &s;et up for the good of Nations, not Nations for the honour or glory of Magi&s;trates.</P>
<P>That the Right and Power of Magi&s;trates in every Country, was that which the Laws of that Country made it to be.</P>
<P>That tho&s;e Laws were to be ob&s;erv'd, and the Oaths taken by them, having the force of a Contract between Magi&s;trate and People, could not be violated without danger of di&s;&s;olving the whole Fabrick.</P>
<P>That U&s;urpation could give no Right, and the mo&s;t dangerous of all Enemys to Kings were they, who rai&s;ing their Power to an exorbitant height, allow'd to U&s;urpers all the Rights belonging unto it.</P>
<P>That &s;uch U&s;urpations being &s;eldom compa&s;s'd without the Slaughter of the Reigning Per&s;on, or Family, the wor&s;t of all Villanys was there|by rewarded with the mo&s;t glorious Privileges.</P>
<P>That if &s;uch Doctrines were receiv'd, they would &s;tir up Men to the De&s;truct on of Princes with more Violence than all the Pa&s;&s;ions that have hitherto rag'd in the Hearts of the mo&s;t Unruly.</P>
<P>That none could be &s;afe, if &s;uch a Reward were propos'd to any that could de&s;tro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> them.</P>
<P>That few would be &s;o gentle as to &s;pare even the Be&s;t, if by their de&s;truction a wild U&s;urper could become God's Anointed, and by the mo&s;t execrable Wickedne&s;s inve&s;t him&s;elf with that Divine Cha|racter.</P>
<P>This is the &s;cope of the whole Treati&s;e; the Writer gives &s;uch Rea|&s;ons as at pre&s;ent did occur unto him, to prove it. This &s;eems to agree
<PB N="423" REF="431">
with the Doctrines of the mo&s;t Reverenc'd Authors of all Times, Na|tions and Religions. The be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of Kings have ever acknow|ledg'd it. The pre&s;ent King of <HI>France</HI> has declar'd that Kings have that happy want of Power, that they can do nothing contrary to the Laws of their Country, and grounds his Quarrel with the King of <HI>Spain, Anno</HI> 1667. upon that Principle&punc; King <HI>James</HI> in his Speech to the Parliament <HI>Anno</HI> 1603. doth in the highe&s;t degree a&s;&s;ert it: The Scripture &s;eems to declare it. If neverthele&s;s the Writer was mi&s;taken, he might have been refuted by Law, Rea&s;on and Scripture; and no Man for &s;uch matters was ever otherwi&s;e puni&s;h'd, than by being made to &s;ee his Error; and it has not (as I think) been ever known that they had been refer'd to the Judgment of a Jury, compos'd of Men utterly unable to comprehend them.</P>
<P>But there was little of this in my Ca&s;e; the extravagance of my Pro&s;ecutors goes higher: the above-mention'd Treati&s;e was never fini&s;h'd, nor could be in many years, and mo&s;t probably would never have been. So much as is of it was written long &s;ince, never review'd nor &s;hewn to any Man; and the fiftieth part of it was not produc'd, and not the tenth of that offer'd to be read. That which was never known to tho&s;e who are &s;aid to have con&s;pir'd with me, was &s;aid to be intended to &s;tir up the People in Pro&s;ecution of the De&s;igns of tho&s;e Con&s;pi|rators.</P>
<P>When nothing of particular Application to Time, Place, or Per&s;on, could be found in it, (as has ever been done by tho&s;e who endeavour'd to rai&s;e In&s;urrections) all was &s;upply'd by <HI>Innuendo's.</HI></P>
<P>What&s;oever is &s;aid of the Expul&s;ion of <HI>Tarquin;</HI> the In&s;urrection again&s;t <HI>Nero;</HI> the Slaughter of <HI>Caligula,</HI> or <HI>Domitian;</HI> the Tran&s;lation of the Crown of <HI>France</HI> from <HI>Meroveus</HI> his Race to <HI>Pepin,</HI> and from his De&s;cendents to <HI>Hugh Capet,</HI> and the like, was apply'd by <HI>Innuendo</HI> to the King.</P>
<P>They have not con&s;ider'd, that if &s;uch Acts of State be not good, there is not a King in the World that has any Title to the Crown he wears; nor can have any, unle&s;s he could deduce his Pedegree from the elde&s;t Son of <HI>Noah,</HI> and &s;hew that the Succe&s;&s;ion had &s;till continu'd in the elde&s;t of the elde&s;t Line, and been &s;o deduc'd to him.</P>
<P>Every one may &s;ee what advantage this would be to all the Kings of the World; and whether that failing, it were not better for them to ac|knowledg they had receiv'd their Crowns by the Con&s;ent of willing Nations, or to have no better Title to them than U&s;urpation and Vio|lence, which by the &s;ame ways may be taken from them.</P>
<P>But I was long &s;ince told that I mu&s;t die, or the Plot mu&s;t die.</P>
<P>Le&s;t the means of de&s;troying the be&s;t Prote&s;tants in <HI>England</HI> &s;hould fail, the Bench mu&s;t be fill'd with &s;uch as had been Blemi&s;hes to the Bar.</P>
<P>None but &s;uch as the&s;e would have advis'd with the King's Council of the means of bringing a Man to death; &s;uffer'd a Jury to be pack'd by the King's Solicitors, and the Under-Sheriff; admit of Jury men who are not Freeholders; receive &s;uch Evidence as is above mention d; refu&s;e a Copy of an Indictment, or &s;uffer the Statute of 46 <HI>Edw.</HI> 3. to be read, that doth expre&s;ly Enact, It &s;hould in no ca&s;e be deny'd to any Man upon any occa&s;ion what&s;oever; over-rule the mo&s;t important Points of Law without hearing. And whereas the Statute, 25 <HI>Ed.</HI> 3.
<PB N="424" REF="432">
upon which they &s;aid I &s;hould be try'd, doth re&s;erve to the Parliament all Con&s;tructions to be made in Points of Trea&s;on, they could a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves not only a Power to make Con&s;tructions, but &s;uch Con|&s;tructions as neither agree with Law, Rea&s;on, or common Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>By the&s;e means I am brought to this Place. The Lord forgive the&s;e Practices, and avert the Evils that threaten the Nation from them. The Lord &s;anctify the&s;e my Sufferings unto me; and tho I fall as a Sacrifice to Idols, &s;uffer not Idolatry to be e&s;tabli&s;h'd in this Land. Ble&s;s thy People, and &s;ave them. Defend thy own Cau&s;e, and defend tho&s;e that defend it. Stir up &s;uch as are &s;aint; direct tho&s;e that are willing; con|firm tho&s;e that waver; give Wi&s;dom and Integrity unto all. Order all things &s;o as may mo&s;t redound to thine own Glory. Grant that I may die glorifying Thee for all thy Mercys, and that at the la&s;t Thou ha&s;t permitted me to be &s;ingl'd out as a Witne&s;s of thy Truth, and even by the Confe&s;&s;ion of my Oppo&s;ers, for that OLD CAUSE in which I was &s;rom my Youth engag'd, and for which Thou ha&s;t often and wonderfully declar'd thy Self.</P>
