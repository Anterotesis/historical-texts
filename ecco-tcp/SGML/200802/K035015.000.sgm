<HEAD>To the RIGHT HONOURABLE The Earl of CHESTERFIELD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Did not dare, &s;o coldly was this Play received by the Town, to a&s;k Leave, in the u&s;ual Forms, to dedicate it to your Lord&s;hip. Its Fate was early determin|ed, and in &s;uch a Manner, that I very lit|tle flatter my&s;elf, it can be worthy of your Lord&s;hip's Patronage, or may pre&s;ume to boa&s;t it was once honoured with your Ap|probation. But as I may, probably, never have another Opportunity, certainly not in this Kind of writing, of publicly profe&s;&s;ing my Re&s;pect, my E&s;teem, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, my Affection for your Lord&s;hip, may I not be forgiven, if I thus dedicate, not the Play, but its Author; not his Poetry, but his Under&s;tanding and his Heart?</P>
<P>WITH Sentiments &s;uch as the&s;e, I dare a&s;&s;ure your Lord&s;hip, you &s;hall not be in|&s;ulted with the u&s;ual, too civil, Language of Dedications. Yet I confe&s;s, I would gladly recover the Name of Dedications to its an|tient Dignity, before they were pro&s;tituted, mo&s;t ab&s;urdly pro&s;tituted, by the Author of the <HI>Phar&s;alia,</HI> when he dedicated to a Tyrant a Poem in Defence of Liberty. I
<PB REF="4">
confe&s;s, I mean to prai&s;e; for hone&s;t Prai&s;e is not only one of the warme&s;t Incitements to Virtue, but its mo&s;t honourable Reward. Great Minds will receive it with their na|tural Greatne&s;s, and only little Spirits have an Affectation of refu&s;ing it. The Ta&s;k, I own, is not without Difficulty, but when the Original is marked with &s;trong and plea&s;ing Lines of Life, a meaner Hand may pre&s;erve the Likene&s;s. The Integrity of his Colouring, if I may be allowed the Ex|pre&s;&s;ion, is of more Con&s;equence, than the Glow and Richne&s;s of it. Dedications would then be like Pictures in Miniature, which the future Hi&s;torian might draw out into larger Proportion, Grace, and Dig|nity.</P>
<P>LET me then have the Honour of in|forming your Lord&s;hip's Hi&s;torian, that al|though your Youth perhaps was &s;pent, a|mong Plea&s;ures, not ill-&s;uited to that gay|er Sea&s;on of Life (neque tu choreas &s;perne, puer) yet it was not lo&s;t among its too fre|quent Di&s;&s;ipations. Ancient and modern Languages, with an accurate and critical Knowledge of the Engli&s;h Tongue, its Har|mony, Copiou&s;ne&s;s, and Variety of Expre&s;|&s;ion, are not to be acquired without much Application. Nor could the greate&s;t natu|ral

Abilities, not even your own, my Lord, have appeared in the mo&s;t important De|bates of the Hou&s;e of Lords, with &s;uch &s;uperior Strength of Rea&s;oning, with Elo|quence (in the true Character of Eloquence) at once plea&s;ing and powerful, had they not been improved by all Advantages of Education.</P>
<P>TO &s;uch Abilities were intru&s;ted the Ho|nour and Intere&s;t of the Nation in Emba&s;&s;ies abroad, and the mo&s;t important Employ|ments at Home. How happily for IRELAND was the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of them &s;ent thither as Lord Lieutenant in that dangerous Cri&s;is, the late Rebellion? One Part of the Na|tion, the natural Enemies of his Maje&s;ty's Government, were to be awed by Power, tempered with Lenity; the other were to be re&s;trained in their Zeal of Loyalty, which though &s;ometimes &s;hewn, perhaps, with too much Warmth, hath ever been their Glory and their Boa&s;t. How happily the Goodne&s;s of your Lord&s;hip's Heart was mixed with the Wi&s;dom of your Councils, the Gratitude of the whole People will for ever acknowledge. Long may you enjoy their Wi&s;hes, their Prayers for your Hap|pine&s;s. Long may you enjoy the Con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of your own Integrity, that nobly
<PB REF="6">
refu&s;ed a Vote of Credit, and an Offer of rai&s;ing a Body of Forces, which you wi&s;ely fore&s;aw would be an u&s;ele&s;s Expence to the Kingdom. What mu&s;t be the Firmne&s;s, and Genero&s;ity of that Spirit, which is not to be &s;educed by Gold, intimidated by Dan|ger, or corrupted by Views of enlarging its Power!</P>
<P>YOUR Lord&s;hip now &s;eems determined (and &s;urely the gallant Veteran de&s;erves his Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion) to retire from all public Bu&s;ine&s;s. Permit, my Lord, this hone&s;t Dedication, for well you know that Flattery would not de&s;ire it, to attend you to your Retreat, and with it be plea&s;ed to accept the &s;incere&s;t Re&s;pect of</P>
