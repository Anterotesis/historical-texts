<HEAD>THE VOYAGES, TRAVELS, AND MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM OWEN GWIN VAUGHAN, <HI><ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI></HEAD>
<P>_WE arriv'd at <HI>Calais,</HI> after a plea|&s;ant Pa&s;&s;age of Six Hours, and took up our Lodging at the <HI>Ta|ble-Royal</HI>; where we were detain'd four Days, with the fal&s;e Report of the Death of the <HI>French</HI> King, <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV; for the Governor kept the Gates &s;hut, and wou'd not permit any Foreigners to go out
<PB N="2" REF="4">
of the City. <HI>Calis,</HI> or <HI>Calais,</HI> is a very &s;trong Town in the Province of <HI>Picardy</HI>; tho' I think not &s;trong enough to be call'd, as it is, one of the Keys of <HI>France.</HI> It is, as near as I cou'd gue&s;s, a little bigger than <HI>Dover,</HI> but more populous. It wou'd, I be|lieve, be a very poor Place, if it were not for the Re&s;ort of Foreigners; and a <HI>French|man</HI> told me, that when they were at War with <HI>England,</HI> their White Bread immedi|ately turn'd to Brown; intimating, their Riches did not come from their own Na|tion.</P>
<P>The Cau&s;e of my Stay here, gave me no &s;mall Joy; for a Letter came to my Hands from my dear <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> which was left at the Po&s;t-Hou&s;e of <HI>Dover,</HI> and brought me by the &s;ame Captain I came over with to <HI>Calais.</HI> This prov'd a Con&s;olation to me in all my Travels; for whenever I was melancholy, I had Recour&s;e to that. The Letter was as fol|lows:
<LETTER>
<P>WHAT &s;hall I &s;ay? I have not Ex|pre&s;&s;ions enough to paint out my Pa&s;|&s;ion. Thy Ab&s;ence, and the farther thou goe&s;t from me, increa&s;e my Love and Anxiety. I look on the all-&s;eeing Sun, and ble&s;s his Beams,
<PB N="3" REF="5">
becau&s;e it &s;hines on thee. I wor&s;hip the Winds, as the <HI>Indians</HI> do the Devil, for fear their Ri|&s;ing &s;hou'd be prejudicial to thee; and the Num|ber of 'em, with their Names, almo&s;t equals the <HI>Roman Catholick</HI> Saints, yet I am oblig'd to revere 'em all in gro&s;s, as they do. My Time is almo&s;t &s;pent in reading the Accounts of Places where I &s;uppo&s;e the Di&s;po&s;er of my Heart is to vi&s;it. I have found the Road to <HI>Dover,</HI> and din'd with you in Imagination, tho' Food is al|mo&s;t a Stranger to me. I &s;aw your Hor&s;es brought out, and pur&s;u'd the Way with you to <HI>Dover.</HI> I &s;aw the Ca&s;tle, the Pier, and view'd the fatal Ve&s;&s;el de&s;ign'd to waft from me all my Peace of Mind.</P>
<P>I follow'd it as far as my poor Eyes cou'd &s;ee, and waited on the Beach, &s;ighing to the Winds, till you arriv'd at <HI>Calais,</HI> as fatal to me for my Lo&s;s, as the Lo&s;s of That was to Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> the Si&s;ter to Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who, when &s;he dy'd, told her Attendants, <HI>they might &s;ee</HI> Calais <HI>written on her Heart.</HI> If Death &s;hou'd end my Days, thy Image wou'd be found on mine. To be a Day without &s;eeing the Idol of my Soul, I have thought long; but Oh! to be ab&s;ent for three times three hundred and &s;ixty five Days, nay, perhaps for ever! what Heart, like mine, can bear the Imagina|tion?
<PB N="4" REF="6">
But yet the Day will come; two tedious Days of the Time are gone already. If Heav'n will be pleas'd to &s;end you back, I &s;hall be grown, by that time, well vers'd in Geography, for that &s;hall be now my only Study; and I &s;hall think it &s;ome Satisfaction in all my Griefs, to know the Situation, Climate, and Con&s;titu|tion of tho&s;e Places my Love intends to vi&s;it. I cou'd dwell on this melancholy Subject for ever, but mu&s;t take Leave of the deare&s;t Object to the di&s;con&s;olate</P>

<P>When our Embargo was taken off, we took Po&s;t-Chai&s;es, and arriv'd at <HI>Paris</HI> in three Days; from whence, in compliance to my Uncle, I &s;ent him the following &s;hort Ac|count of my Journey.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Uncle,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER turning my Back to my Native Country (tho' my Mind was &s;till there) we arriv'd &s;afe at <HI>Calais;</HI> from thence (after being detain'd four Days by a fal&s;e Report of the King's Death) we made three hard Days Jour|nies to <HI>Paris.</HI> From whence I &s;hall &s;end you this &s;hort De&s;cription, to let you &s;ee I intend to follow your Precepts exactly. <HI>Paris,</HI> the Capi|tal
<PB N="5" REF="7">
of <HI>France,</HI> is &s;ituated upon an I&s;land in the River <HI>Seine,</HI> which gives Name to a County, call'd, the <HI>I&s;le of France;</HI> tho' it is po&s;&s;ible it may &s;tand upon more Ground than <HI>London,</HI> yet I take the latter to be better inhabited than the former. Their publick Buildings far ex|ceed ours in Number and Magnificence. The <HI>Louvre</HI> much &s;urpa&s;&s;es that of <HI>St. James's</HI> or <HI>Whitehall</HI> before it was con&s;um'd by Fire. As to their Cathedral Church of <HI>Notre-Dame,</HI> I can't make any Compari&s;on with that of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, till I &s;ee it fini&s;h'd; but I think this, a noble augu&s;t Buil|ding, and the Magnificence of the In&s;ide &s;hews their Religion to be well dre&s;t, and gives a Lu|&s;tre I am not able to de&s;cribe. The Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Paris</HI> &s;eems to be &s;eated with more Grandeur than an Ea&s;tern King.</P>
<P>Here's Plenty of Wine, but no good Water that I cou'd meet with. In the Chapel call'd <HI>The Holy Chapel,</HI> which is a fine Building, I was &s;hew'd Part of the Crown of Thorns the <HI>Jews,</HI> in Deri&s;on, honour'd our Saviour with; and two of the Nails that fixt him to the Cro&s;s; but, I mu&s;t own, my Faith was not quite &s;trong enough to believe it, tho' I thought it prudent to keep my Thoughts to my&s;elf. The Mona&s;teries are &s;o numerous here, that one wou'd imagine the Laity were not the major Part; and mo&s;t of the
<PB N="6" REF="8">
Holy Buildings are fit to be Palaces for the great|e&s;t Princes.</P>
<P>The Earth, in one of their Churchyards, as I am told, will con&s;ume the Interr'd in eight Days. The reverend Father <HI>Raimond,</HI> whom you commended me to, has been dead more than four Years: But his Brother, who has taken Orders &s;ince, who was al&s;o one of your Ac|quaintance, has done me many Services upon your Account. La&s;t Night he took me to the <HI>Je&s;uits-College,</HI> where a Play was perform'd with the utmo&s;t Magnificence, and the Number of the Chorus Dancers &s;urpris'd me. I counted forty-four in one Entry. In &s;hort, Sir, <HI>Paris</HI> has many curious Objects to delight the Eye, and captivate the Sen&s;es. I have &s;ent you the Book of the <HI>Carrou&s;els</HI> that were perform'd <HI>1612,</HI> when the double Marriages of the King and his Si&s;ter, with the Prince and Infanta of <HI>Spain</HI> were celebrated. In the &s;ame Place King <HI>Hen|ry II.</HI> in one of tho&s;e Tournaments, was kill'd by a Wound in the Eye. I am inform'd by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Coypel</HI> the Ingraver, the Figure of every Per&s;on is exactly like whom it is de&s;ign'd for. I have al&s;o &s;ent you the Statue of <HI>Lewis the Thirteenth,</HI> of the &s;ame Compo&s;ition, in every degree, that &s;tands in the middle of the <HI>Palace-Royal,</HI> and, in my Judgment, it wants
<PB N="7" REF="9">
nothing but Bulk, to be as fine as the Original. You will likewi&s;e find in the &s;ame Parcel all the <HI>Cla&s;&s;ics</HI> printed at the <HI>Louvre;</HI> tho' I was ob|lig'd to Father <HI>Raimond</HI> for your Favourite <HI>Terence;</HI> the re&s;t I procur'd of a Book&s;eller. To-morrow, the good Father is to introduce me to Mon&s;ieur and Madam <HI>D'Acier,</HI> where I promi&s;e to my&s;elf much Satisfaction, if my want of Years will not make 'em look coldly upon me. I gave Mon&s;ieur <HI>Audran</HI> the Pre&s;ent you &s;ent him; and, in return, he has &s;ent you a Set of his Battles, from <HI>Le Brun,</HI> of the fir&s;t Impre&s;|&s;ion, which, by the by, Uncle, &s;eem'd as if you had &s;ent (as they &s;ay in <HI>Wales) Apple-Sauce to fetch a Pig;</HI> for they are hardly to be va|lu'd.</P>
<P>After telling you, the Dirt of <HI>Paris,</HI> like an ill Reputation, is hard to be got off, I &s;hall conclude my little Account of that City, with telling you, the Mona&s;tery of <HI>Val de Grace,</HI> is, I think, one of the fine&s;t Buildings in <HI>Paris,</HI> which one of their Poets has thought fit to com|mend in the following Lines.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Urbs</HI> orbi &s;imilis, toto celeberrima <HI>Mundo,</HI></L>

<P><PB N="8" REF="10">From <HI>Paris,</HI> I &s;hall lead you to <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> a Royal Palace, four <HI>French</HI> Leagues We&s;t of this famous City. I &s;hall wave the De&s;cription of the Palace, and bring you into the Gardens, which I &s;uppo&s;e are fini&s;h'd &s;ince you were in <HI>France.</HI> When you are enter'd, the Ba&s;on of <HI>Syrene</HI> &s;tands full in your way; and after that, twenty-two more fine Fountains, Water-Falls, and Ca&s;cades, that delight the Eye with an Ex|uberance of Variety. From the&s;e, you pa&s;s in|to the <HI>Labyrinth,</HI> a Place you can't well get out of, without a &s;ilver Clue, and yet 'tis the mo&s;t delightful Place to lo&s;e one's &s;elf in, in the Univer&s;e. <HI>Ae&s;op</HI> &s;tands on one &s;ide of the En|trance, and <HI>Cupid</HI> on the other.

<P>Nothing in the World can &s;hew the Grandeur of the Monarch more, than this Palace and Gardens. And the Nobility, to imitate their Prince, have built hand&s;ome Palaces near <HI>Ver|&s;ailles,</HI> &s;o that this Place, that was, fifty Years ago, a barren Spot, is now become a great Ci|ty;
<PB N="10" REF="12">
I mean, for the Multiplicity of the Build|ings; tho' every thing is exce&s;&s;ive dear, from the great Concour&s;e of Nobility that &s;urround their Prince. A <HI>French</HI> Gentleman that had been in <HI>England,</HI> told me, he wonder'd the Kings of <HI>England</HI> had not more magnificent Palaces, Gardens and Water-Works. I reply'd, we had finer Water-Works than any they cou'd boa&s;t of. Water-Works! return'd the <HI>Frenchman;</HI> where? I reply'd, in the City of <HI>London,</HI> where every Hou&s;e had a Sufficiency of Water, convey'd from the Rivers by Pipes. He con|fe&s;s'd indeed, that was a very great Work, and was certainly of more U&s;e than theirs of <HI>Ver&s;ailles.</HI></P>
<P>When we return'd to <HI>Paris,</HI> Father <HI>Raimond</HI> carry'd me to a little Village call'd <HI>Mont Mar|tire,</HI> or <HI>Mons Martyrum,</HI> where we din'd at the Abbey of Nuns of the Order of St. <HI>Bennet.</HI> This Hill and Village took its Name of <HI>Mons Martyrum,</HI> from St. <HI>Denis</HI> the Protector of <HI>France,</HI> who was beheaded before the Image of <HI>Mercury,</HI> in the <HI>Pagans</HI> Time. And the good People will have it, that the pious Saint walk'd three Mile with his Head under his Arm, and then let it drop; where &s;ince they have built a Town, after the Saint's Name. But I am apt to believe, their Heads that approve this
<PB N="11" REF="13">
Story are no more a Burden to their Shoulders, than the good Saint's was when he had it under his Arm. Father <HI>Raimond,</HI> otherwi&s;e Bigot enough to his Religion, &s;eems to laugh at &s;uch Traditional Stories.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Afternoon we made a Tour to the Town of St. <HI>Denis,</HI> where we view'd the Ca|thedral, which is very magnificent; tho' the Re|po&s;itory of their Kings, to me, &s;eem'd the chiefe&s;t Ornament. The Inhabitants tell you, this Church was never ill us'd, either in the <HI>Norman</HI> or <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Wars; tho' mo&s;t of the others in <HI>France,</HI> where the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Normans</HI> came, &s;uffer'd much. The Abbot of this Place has more Power than many Archbi&s;hops, and owns no Superior but the King, being Suffragan to no Archbi&s;hop, And tho' the Monarchs of <HI>France</HI> are crown'd at <HI>Rhemes,</HI> the <HI>Regalia</HI> is kept at St. <HI>Dennis,</HI> under the Care of the <HI>Abbot.</HI> They al&s;o Boa&s;t of more Relicks than any other Place in the Uni|ver&s;e; as, the Head of St. <HI>Denis,</HI> put in a &s;ilver Nightcap, with fine oriental Pearl round it; a Nail of our Saviour's Cro&s;s; the Finger that St. <HI>Thomas</HI> put into our Saviour's Side; an Arm of St. <HI>Simon;</HI> the Head of St. <HI>Bennet;</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> that was with me the &s;ame time we &s;aw the&s;e Rarities, told me St. <HI>Bennet</HI> mu&s;t be a very mon&s;trous Saint, for he knew of one of
<PB N="12" REF="14">
his Heads in <HI>Italy,</HI> and another in <HI>Spain;</HI> but his Companion &s;alv'd that, by telling him, he &s;hed his Heads, as Stags do their Horns. I hope you'll pardon this merry Account, &s;ince it is not my own. Then there is a Cup that King <HI>So|lomon</HI> us'd to drink out of; but my merry <HI>En|li&s;hman</HI> affronted the Friar that &s;hew'd us the&s;e Rarities, by asking him, if King <HI>Soloman</HI> drank it full always, for it was a very large one. A Pot that was at the Wedding of <HI>Cana</HI> in <HI>Ga|lilee,</HI> where our Saviour turn'd Water into Wine; <HI>Joan</HI> of <HI>Arc</HI>'s Sword, which I think is bigger than that of <HI>Edward the Third</HI>'s, in <HI>Henry the Seventh</HI>'s Chapel in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey; Judas</HI>'s Lanthorn, that he bore when he betray'd our Saviour with a Ki&s;s; and many more which we did not &s;ee; for when our <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Companion ask'd the Friar, how often the Horns had been mended, he grew outrageous, and wou'd &s;hew us no more; and Father <HI>Rai|mond</HI> was very much &s;candaliz'd in bringing &s;uch a Parcel of <HI>Hereticks</HI> to profane their Re|licks, by looking on 'em.</P>
<P>I am much pleas'd with my Tutor; tho' he &s;eems very re&s;erv'd in giving me any Account of his former Condition or Family. Tho' an Ac|cident happen'd a few Days ago, that makes me imagine there's &s;omething very extraordinary in
<PB N="13" REF="15">
his Affairs. An <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> young Gentleman, a Traveller, did me the Honour to make me a Vi|&s;it &s;ome few Days ago; and my Tutor coming in, &s;eem'd in the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion at his Sight, and went out of the Room (unperceiv'd by my Vi&s;itor) with a great deal of Precipitation. In a Day or two afterwards, when I inform'd him I was to dine with the &s;ame Per&s;on, he intreat|ed me very earne&s;tly to be excus'd; and told me, he had &s;uch Rea&s;ons for not &s;eeing him, that if I was acquainted with 'em, I wou'd certainly pardon him in de&s;iring not to be in his Company. I fan&s;y, when we are a little more familiar, he will be more free, and let me into this Affair. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, it puzzles me very much. I &s;hall not give you any farther Trouble now, my dear Uncle; but be pleas'd to give my Re&s;pects to the amiable Family we la&s;t vi&s;ited; and give me Leave to &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>I was oblig'd to leave <HI>Paris</HI> &s;ooner than I intended, upon receiving the following Let|ter:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> KNOW for certain your Life is in Dan|ger, therefore wou'd advi&s;e you to quit the Place as &s;oon and as &s;ecretly as you can. A Gentleman of my Acquaintance imagines the Coldne&s;s of his Mi&s;tre&s;s proceeds from the E&s;teem &s;he has for you. I have in vain endeavour'd to convince him of the contrary. Perhaps I &s;hould not be in &s;o much Fear for you, if he had Ge|nero&s;ity enough openly to re&s;ent his ill-grounded Hatred to you; but I know him to he a Per&s;on as void of Honour, as of Courage, therefore every thing is to be fear'd from him. Take care of the Servant you have hir'd, for I have taken notice they are often together. It is po&s;&s;ible there may be no Harm in their Intimacy; however, I think Caution is nece&s;&s;ary. Therefore, if you plea&s;e, I will borrow him for a few Days, and &s;end him upon a Bu&s;ine&s;s that he may execute for me as well as an hone&s;t Man, if he &s;hou'd prove a Villain. I wou'd not have you &s;tir out to-day,
<PB N="15" REF="17">
nor receive any Vi&s;its, if you can hand&s;omely a|void it. I'll be with you in the Evening, and inform you farther.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Entirely yours, RAIMOND.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>The receiving of this Letter very much &s;urpriz'd me; for all the Time I remain'd in <HI>Paris,</HI> I had not made any Acquaintance with the Fair Sex; and, bating the Vi&s;it I made to Mon&s;ieur and Madam <HI>D'Acier,</HI> I had not been in the Company of any Females. The Thoughts of leaving <HI>Paris</HI> very much re|joic'd my Tutor, who was never ea&s;y, upon the Account of that young Gentleman. I communicated the Letter to him, who was as much &s;urpriz'd as I was. In the Evening Father <HI>Raimond</HI> came, and pre&s;s'd me to be gone the next Day. He inform'd me his Acquaintance had courted a young Lady, and &s;hew'd him a Letter from the very Per|&s;on, where &s;he her&s;elf inform'd him of all he knew, and was as pre&s;&s;ing for me to be gone, as the good Father. Therefore I a|greed to &s;et out for <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> the next Day, in order to imbark for <HI>Italy,</HI> and my Bag|gage was to follow me. I &s;ent my <HI>French</HI>

Servant to the good Father, who took him home that Night; and the next Morning I pur&s;u'd my Journey with my Tutor, and my <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Servant, who might very well pa&s;s for a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> for he &s;poke that Language as well as <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> I was very much &s;urpriz'd and vex'd at this Accident, for having got acquainted with &s;everal Per&s;ons of the <HI>Royal-Academy</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> I had the plea&s;ing Hope of cultivating my Under&s;tanding by their Con|ver&s;ation; for Study, and the Thoughts of my lovely <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> fill'd up all my Time.</P>
<P>In our third Day's Journey, near the Skirts of a Wood, we were attack'd by half a Do|zen Robbers, who wou'd have certainly got the better of us, if, while we were engag'd with them, two <HI>French</HI> Gentlemen, with their Servants, had not arriv'd &s;ea&s;onably to our Re&s;cue. We left two dead upon the Place, and the other four made their E&s;cape. I re|turn'd the <HI>French</HI> Gentlemen the Thanks they de&s;erv'd for their Succour; for if they had not come to our A&s;&s;i&s;tance, we mu&s;t certainly have been murder'd; but, by the Providence of God, not one of us was wounded. The Gentlemen were bound for <HI>Toulon,</HI> therefore I re&s;olv'd to accompany them to that Place, which lay as convenient (they inform'd me)
<PB N="17" REF="19">
to embark for <HI>Italy,</HI> as <HI>Mar&s;eilles.</HI> We thought it proper to pu&s;h on, without taking any Notice of w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters"> happen'd to us, becau&s;e it wou'd retard our Journey; tho' we might have receiv'd a Reward for the Death of the two Thieves. We all arriv'd &s;afe at <HI>Toulon,</HI> without meeting any other Accident by the way; from whence I &s;ent Orders to <HI>Mar|&s;eilles</HI> for my Baggage to be brought from thence. But the <HI>French</HI> Gentlemen leaving me the next Day, I thought it proper to go to <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> my&s;elf. <HI>Toulon,</HI> the <HI>Telo Mar|tius</HI> of the <HI>Romans,</HI> is a Bi&s;hoprick, and has a very fine Port, and very &s;trongly fortify'd. The two great Moles, of 700 Paces each, that almo&s;t cover the whole Port, has not been many Years fini&s;h'd by the pre&s;ent King, <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. tho' begun by <HI>Henry</HI> IV. When I arriv'd at <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> which lies about 40 Miles from <HI>Toulon,</HI> I receiv'd a Packet of Letters from <HI>England,</HI> which the good Father <HI>Raimond</HI> took care to &s;end, with another from <HI>Paris</HI> from an unknown Lady, that unra|vell'd the Meaning of my &s;o &s;uddenly leaving that City, the Letter was as follows:

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> AM in Love, and have long been belov'd by a Gentleman, that has taken it into his Head to be jealous of you, tho' I never had the Honour of conver&s;ing with you. I have &s;een you, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, and had the Inadvertency to commend you before him, tho' without any farther Thought; for the Per&s;on I mention has laid &s;uch Hold of my Heart, it can never get from him. 'Twas I that us'd that Method with Father <HI>Raimond,</HI> to make you abandon <HI>Paris,</HI> which I hope you will forgive, for I &s;hou'd ne|ver have brought to Temper the Heart of him whom I love more than my&s;elf, if you had con|tinu'd here. The De&s;ign upon your Life was all Fiction, for the Man whom I adore has too much Honour to deal &s;o treacherou&s;ly with any Per&s;on. His only Fault is Jealou&s;y, but that's a Sign of his Pa&s;&s;ion for me. As you came to <HI>Paris</HI> as a Traveller, I hope your &s;udden leav|ing it will not prove prejudicial to you. And remember, the Women of <HI>France</HI> are not &s;o fond of Variety, as many Foreigners imagine: Tho' I believe you have too good Under&s;tanding to fall into that mean way of Thinking. I am &s;o much a Stranger to you, that I hardly know whether you are vers'd enough in our Language to read
<PB N="19" REF="21">
an Epi&s;tle of this Nature, therefore it has given me &s;ome Trouble to have it tran&s;lated into <HI>Eng|li&s;h;</HI> for which, I hope you will pardon one, who will ever have a good Opinion of your good Nature. The Servant too is hone&s;t, and to re|ward him for the Lo&s;s of &s;o good a Ma&s;ter, I have taken him into my Service, and I intend to make him amends. I might have let you con|tinue in Ignorance of this Adventure, but I cou'd not bear you &s;hou'd have a hard Thought of the Per&s;on I e&s;teem, tho' an utter Stranger to you; and I &s;hall think my &s;elf oblig'd ever to &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf</P>

<P>I mu&s;t own, I was a little unea&s;y to be made &s;uch a Tool of. However, I &s;oon for|gave the Lady, con&s;idering the Power of Love.</P>
<P>I was compell'd to wait a Fortnight for want of a Ve&s;&s;el to imbark in for <HI>Genoa,</HI> and therefore had Lei&s;ure enough to view this Ci|ty. <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> is a City of the greate&s;t Anti|quity in <HI>France.</HI> It was founded by the <HI>Pho|ceans,</HI> a Colony from <HI>Athens,</HI> as <HI>Strabo</HI> tells me. It is one of the fine&s;t Ports of <HI>France,</HI> and the &s;afe&s;t, for it was never known any Ve&s;|&s;el ever peri&s;h'd there by Storm. It was a
<PB N="20" REF="22">
flouri&s;hing City in the time of the <HI>Romans,</HI> who made Alliances with 'em, finding it not an ea&s;y Matter to overcome it. By the Means of its <HI>Levant</HI> Trade, it is e&s;teem'd the riche&s;t City in <HI>France</HI>; and its Situation upon the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> makes it &s;o advantageous for Trade, that it will ever prove &s;o. This Ci|ty was free, till the Year 1481, when it &s;ub|mitted to the King of <HI>France,</HI> with the re&s;t of <HI>Provence.</HI> It is &s;o well Peopled, that it is difficult to walk the Streets, for the Mul|titude of Pa&s;&s;engers backwards and forwards. The publick Buildings are very magnificent. Here the Gallies of the Crown are kept in admirable Order, under command of a &s;trong Tier of Guns. The Churches and Mona&s;te|ries are numerous, and beautiful, and the Clergy here &s;eem more open and facetious, than in any other Place I have &s;een in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>I embark'd for <HI>Genoa</HI> in a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ve&s;&s;el bound for that Place; but in the Dusk of the Evening, which &s;ucceeded the fir&s;t Day of our Voyage, we were pur&s;u'd by a Cor&s;air of <HI>Tunis.</HI> The Fright and Confu&s;ion was very great, for our Ve&s;&s;el carry'd but Eight Guns, and Sixteen Men, be&s;ides Eight Pa&s;|&s;engers. The Ma&s;ter made many fal&s;e Tacks,
<PB N="21" REF="23">
in hopes to lo&s;e him in the Night; but at the Dawn of Day, we di&s;cover'd him about two Leagues to Leeward of us, and the Wind cea&s;ing with the Ri&s;ing of the Sun, we had no Hopes to e&s;cape, for they made up to us with their Oars, which we were without. How|ever, both Sailors and Pa&s;&s;engers re&s;olv'd up|on their Defence, and the rather, becau&s;e we ob&s;erv'd a Ve&s;&s;el under the <HI>French</HI> Shore, who, by her Working, &s;eem'd to endeavour to come up to us; tho' &s;ome of the mo&s;t timorous wou'd have it another Rover of <HI>Barbary.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding, we made ready to receive 'em. But the Wind fre&s;hning a little, we cho&s;e to make all the Sail we cou'd for the Port of <HI>Toulon,</HI> not above Seven Leagues di|&s;tant from us. But our Endeavours prov'd fruitle&s;s, for before Eight a Clock &s;he came within Gun-&s;hot of us, and ply'd us with her fore-chace Guns, tho' without any Da|mage, for not one of the Shot enter'd our Ship; which they perceiving, left off firing, becau&s;e it retarded their Cour&s;e, and row'd hard to come along &s;ide of us, which they did in an Hour from their fir&s;t Firing. When they came within Haling, they bid us &s;trike that Moment, or every Man (when we were taken) &s;hou'd be flung overboard. But we
<PB N="22" REF="24">
gave 'em no other An&s;wer, than with our great Guns, and &s;mall Arms, which I believe they did not expect. But they return'd our Civility with Intere&s;t; and after plying it warmly on both Sides for half an Hour, they boarded us on our Foreca&s;tle; and tho&s;e that under&s;tood their Language, declar'd we &s;hou'd all fall a Sacrifice to their Revenge. The Knowledge of that gave us fre&s;h Re&s;olution to fell our Lives as dear as we cou'd; but an accidental Shot taking away our Colours, the Rovers thought we had &s;truck to 'em, which gave 'em &s;ome Pau&s;e. But when they found we continu'd the Fight, even to De&s;peration, they fell on furiou&s;ly again. But a lucky Shot from us, flew into their Powder-Room, and blew up their Quarter within two Foot of the Water. This gave us fre&s;h Courage, and we clear'd the Deck of all that were alive on Board us. They cut off their Grapples, and fell a Stern, but &s;till ply'd us with their &s;mall and great Shot. We made all the Sail we cou'd to get out of their way, and, by degrees, left 'em out of Gun-&s;hot; but found our Ship &s;hot thro' in &s;everal Places between Wind and Water, and we were forc'd to lie by to &s;top our Leaks. While we were en|deavouring to find 'em out, it was a great Sa|tisfaction
<PB N="23" REF="25">
to me to &s;ee the other Ship we &s;aw under the Shore, get up with the <HI>Cor&s;air,</HI> and engage her; they fought furiou&s;ly about half an Hour, but at la&s;t overcame her; yet that Satisfaction was allay'd, by my being in|form'd our Leaks cou'd not be found; and the Water gain'd upon us, notwith&s;tanding they labour'd hard at the Pump. The Ma|&s;ter immediately made a Signal of Di&s;tre&s;s, and the Ship and Prize came to our A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. The Ship prov'd a <HI>Spani&s;h Gard de Co&s;te.</HI> The Captain came on Board us, and very civilly offer'd me a Cabbin of his Lieu|tenant's, who was kill'd in the Engagement with the <HI>Cor&s;air.</HI> I was much pleas'd with the Offer, and got my Things remov'd on Board. The Captain's Name was <HI>Don Ju|an de Fon&s;eca</HI>; his Ship from <HI>Barcelona,</HI> of 30 Guns, where he was oblig'd to go to re|fit, for this was his &s;econd Engagement. In the fir&s;t, he had &s;unk a Rover of <HI>Barbary,</HI> who went to the Bottom, without &s;aving one Human Creature. Our Ship had made &s;hift to &s;top her Leaks, but not &s;o effectually as to pur&s;ue her Voyage; &s;o, after a Con&s;ultation, the Ma&s;ter determin'd to [put into <HI>Toulon</HI> to refit. Therefore I re&s;olv'd to accompany the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Captain to <HI>Barcelona,</HI> having &s;atis|fy'd
<PB N="24" REF="26">
the <HI>Dutchman</HI> for my Pa&s;&s;age. I had much ado to make him accept it, telling me I had done him more Service than that came to, in the Engagement. Tho' I, my Tutor, and Servant, had the good Fortune to e&s;cape without any Wound in our Bodies, yet &s;everal Shot had pierc'd our Cloaths. The Stock of my Carbine was &s;hot away, as I was charging it, without doing me any Hurt; and the Hat of my Tutor had part of the Brim &s;hot away. We lo&s;t but three Sailors in the de&s;perate Engagement, and five wounded, two of which were Pa&s;&s;en|gers. Before Night, we parted with the <HI>Dutchman,</HI> and &s;aw him, by the Help of a Tele&s;cope, enter the Harbour of <HI>Toulon,</HI> ere it was dark; and we pur&s;u'd our Voyage for <HI>Barcelona,</HI> accompany'd with the <HI>Algerine</HI> Prize.</P>
<P>The Captain of the <HI>Spaniard</HI> lo&s;t nineteen Men in this la&s;t Engagement, and thirty-five in the former, be&s;ides thirty wounded in both, &s;o that his Complement was &s;o very much le&s;|&s;en'd, that if it had not been for the Help of the Galley-Slaves out of the <HI>Cor&s;air</HI> (who were mo&s;t <HI>Spaniards</HI>) he cou'd not have work'd his Ship. The Captain of the Prize was a <HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> Renegade, who was intended
<PB N="25" REF="27">
to be executed as &s;oon as we arriv'd in <HI>Spain</HI>; but a Wound he received in the Groin pre|vented it, for he expir'd before we got into Harbour. The re&s;t were <HI>Moors,</HI> therefore intended for the Gallies of <HI>Spain</HI>; their Com|plement was 280 Men, when they fir&s;t &s;et out a Roving, but they had lo&s;t 27 in the En|gagement with us, be&s;ides 11 that were blown up with their Powder; and 59 with the <HI>Spa|niard. Don Juan de Fon&s;eca</HI> made me a Pre|&s;ent of a very fine <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Scimitar, adorn'd with wrought Gold, which very much pleas'd me; and in Return, I made him, with a great many Intreaties, accept of a Gold Watch of <HI>Tompion</HI>'s make; but I had almo&s;t affronted him, when I offer'd to &s;atisfy him for my Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Barcelona,</HI> where we ar|riv'd without any Impediment. He did me the Honour to introduce me to the Governor, and &s;aid &s;o many things in my Commenda|tion, that made me a&s;ham'd to hear 'em. But the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are noted for Hyperboles. However, the Governor us'd me with a great deal of Civility, wondering a Per&s;on &s;o young, &s;hou'd begin his Travels &s;o early; and order'd me an Apartment in the Ca&s;tle; and in all the time I continu'd there, never pre&s;s'd me to go to Ma&s;s, or once ask'd me
<PB N="26" REF="28">
concerning my Religion, which I was very well pleas'd at; for he was a&s;&s;ur'd I was a Prote&s;tant, by my Country.</P>
<P><HI>Don Juan de Fon&s;eca</HI> was hardly ever from me; and the Civilities I receiv'd from him, I &s;hall never forget. I found nothing of the &s;tiff formal <HI>Spaniard</HI> in him, nor indeed a|mong any I had the Fortune to conver&s;e with; &s;o that I imagine the general Character of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> we receive in <HI>England,</HI> is not alto|gether true. They are certainly cautious con|cerning their Women, yet not all out; &s;o much as I expected, for I never was intro|duced into any Family, without &s;eeing the Female Part of it; but they never &s;tay long in Company; or indeed &s;eldom look at any Strangers, but when they are &s;poke to, or ju&s;t upon their Entrance into a Room, and when they take their Leave.</P>
<P><HI>Barcelona</HI> (the <HI>Roman Barcino</HI>) is the Ca|pital of the Province of <HI>Catalonia.</HI> It was built by <HI>Barca</HI> the <HI>Carthaginian,</HI> from whom it takes its Name. Though &s;ometimes it was call'd by the <HI>Romans, Faventia Colonia,</HI> and <HI>Julia Augu&s;ta</HI> It was taken from the <HI>Moors</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> by <HI>Lewis the Pious,</HI> Emperor of <HI>Germany.</HI> It has two Rivers that wa&s;h the North and South Side, tho' neither of them
<PB N="27" REF="29">
of any great Note. The Mole is a very fine one, tho' the Harbour being &s;o full of Sand, will not permit large Ve&s;&s;els Entrance. The Buildings are very hand&s;ome, tho' it does not exceed <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> in any thing; and for Trade, it falls very &s;hort. I was advis'd by every Body to Winter at <HI>Barcelona,</HI> which I re&s;olv'd to do to perfect my&s;elf in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Lan|guage. Nothing extraordinary happen'd to me while I was there; tho' Murders were committed almo&s;t every Night, which is reckon'd nothing there. One Gentlewo|man was murder'd by her Brother, as &s;he came from her Devotion at the Cathedral Church. This poor Lady, it &s;eems, had an Intrigue with one of the Dons of the Place, and the Brother came as far as <HI>Toledo</HI> to pu|ni&s;h the Stain of his Family, as he call'd it; and I never knew he was &s;o much as impri|&s;on'd for it. Another Per&s;on of Note was &s;hot thro' the Back, as he was making Wa|ter again&s;t a Wall: This Gentleman, it &s;eems, had been too bu&s;y with another Man's Wife, as the Rumour went, tho' the Adventure was forgot the next Day.</P>
<P>The Death of one Gentleman gave me &s;ome Concern, having &s;ome Knowledge of him. He was a Per&s;on of good Extraction,
<PB N="28" REF="30">
but his Family was fallen to Decay. He made his Addre&s;&s;es to a beautiful Lady, and gain'd her Affection; but the Parents of the Lady got him a Po&s;t to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> not out of Love, but to get him out of the way. How|ever, the enamour'd Couple corre&s;ponded to|gether by Letter for two Years. In the mean time, her Parents re&s;olv'd to wed her, again&s;t her Will, to a rich <HI>Spaniard</HI> of Quality, that was in Love with her. The young Lady &s;ent Word to her Lover, of her unhappy Marriage that was approaching, and attempt|ed to make her E&s;cape, but was prevented by the Infidelity of her Confidant. The Gentle|man, under&s;tanding how Matters went, re|&s;ign'd his Po&s;t in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and arriv'd at <HI>Barcelona</HI> ten Days after the fatal Marriage was con&s;ummated. The News almo&s;t broke his Heart; and his Pa&s;&s;ion was &s;o violent, that he ca&s;t many ways to get a Sight of his Mi|&s;tre&s;s, and at la&s;t obtain'd it. They had &s;e|veral Meetings at a Friend's Hou&s;e of the Gentleman's; but I was inform'd by a Per|&s;on that knew the Affair, that all their Meet|ings were very innocent. At la&s;t, they were di&s;cover'd by the new Husband, who hir'd &s;everal Bravos, that did their Work &s;o well, the poor Gentleman was murder'd as he was
<PB N="29" REF="31">
ju&s;t entring the Door where his Mi&s;tre&s;s wait|ed for him. Some time after, the Husband met with the &s;ame Fate, as he came from vi|&s;iting a new Mi&s;tre&s;s. Some &s;uppos'd the Wife had a Hand in the Murder; but it was never found out; and the Lady went into a Mona&s;tery. Before I left <HI>Barcelona,</HI> I re|ceiv'd a Letter from my dear <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> with &s;everal from my Uncle and Father; that of <HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s was as follows:

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LIFE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> THOUGHT I never &s;hou'd have heard from you more. And tho' I allow'd of the Difficulty of &s;ending to <HI>England</HI> at all times, yet I began to have the utmo&s;t Unea&s;ine&s;s. But now I know the Rea&s;on of it, my Fears are re|doubled. Your Tutor has wrote an Account to your Uncle, of your Engagement with a <HI>Cor|&s;air</HI> of <HI>Barbary,</HI> where he declares you were their <HI>Guardian-Angel.</HI> Con&s;ider, my Love, you have two Lives to an&s;wer for, that of your own, and (I hope) of your <HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s; tho' yours is far more dear to me, than my own. If the Love you profe&s;s'd to me be not a Fiction, do not tru&s;t the Sea, but with the utmo&s;t Nece&s;&s;ity. You have prov'd it an uncon&s;tant Element al|ready, and more Dangers attend it, than Storms

and Shipwrecks; you may go from <HI>Barcelona</HI> to <HI>Italy,</HI> if you plea&s;e, by Land; for I am now grown a Mi&s;tre&s;s in <HI>Geography,</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> was my Teacher.

No que&s;tion but <HI>France, Spain,</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> have Beauties enough to put the &s;tronge&s;t Faith to a dangerous Trial.

</LETTER></P>
<P>This Letter was the only Joy I receiv'd, all the while I was at <HI>Barcelona</HI>; tho' I was di&s;turb'd at the Account of my Rival's re|newing his Addre&s;&s;es. The Governor ask'd me if I had not gain'd a Mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;ince my Arrival; and when I an&s;wer'd him in the Negative, he &s;eem'd &s;urpriz'd! Sure, &s;aid
<PB N="31" REF="33">
he, you mu&s;t have a very in&s;en&s;ible Heart, not to feel the Charms of Love in &s;o warm a Climate, where it is almo&s;t the chief Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Nation. But alas! he knew little of my Soul, which felt the Pangs of Love in a much colder Climate than <HI>Spain.</HI> I receiv'd &s;o many Civilities from this Gentleman, that very much perplex'd me, becau&s;e I had no|thing extraordinary to make him a Return; and, to add to the Obligations I had to him, when I left <HI>Barcelona,</HI> he gave me Leave to redeem a Slave from the Galleys, which is e&s;teem'd the greate&s;t Honour can be done to any Stranger: Tho' I did not take &s;o much Time to examine the Demerits of the Crimi|nals, as a Nobleman did; who, having the &s;ame Honour done him, ask'd all the Slaves the Crimes that brought them into that Con|dition; but every one of 'em, to the la&s;t Man, told him, they were either put in by Malice, or Mi&s;take: But the la&s;t Man told him frank|ly, He cou'd not &s;ay but he was put in very ju&s;tly, for taking a Pur&s;e in <HI>Tarragona,</HI> with|out the Con&s;ent of the Owner. The Duke, upon this, gave him a Stroke with his Cane, You Rogue, &s;aid he, what do you here, a|mong &s;uch a Parcel of hone&s;t innocent Fel|lows? Get about your Bu&s;ine&s;s! The Per|&s;on
<PB N="32" REF="34">
I redeem'd, was both old, and unhealthy, and therefore I thought him the propere&s;t Per|&s;on among 'em, that he might have the Sa|tisfaction of ending the Remainder of his Days in Freedom.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erv'd a gloomy Melancholy had &s;eiz'd my Tutor, and tho' I &s;trove all I cou'd to di|vert him, yet I found it to no Purpo&s;e; nei|ther cou'd I prevail upon him to know the Cau&s;e of his Sorrow; he only an&s;wer'd me, that it was his natural Di&s;po&s;ition. But I &s;aw too much of him, not to know his Di&s;ea&s;e lay in the Mind; yet had Hope, Time, and the various Climates we &s;hou'd vi&s;it, wou'd cure him; but hitherto his Malady increas'd. One Day, when I was retir'd to my Clo&s;et, to write &s;ome Letters to <HI>England,</HI> he came into the Room, not knowing I was there, and for &s;ome time &s;igh'd and wept bitterly; at la&s;t, he broke out into &s;omething like the following Complaint. Sure never wretched Mortal ever felt the Pains and Di&s;appoint|ments that I have undergone! They are too great to bear! All-&s;eeing Heaven, that in|flicts the&s;e Puni&s;hments upon us, creeping Things, &s;ure will forgive us, if we &s;eek a Remedy by Death, for nought but Death can cure my Misfortunes. As he was going
<PB N="33" REF="35">
on with his Complaints, I purpo&s;ely made a Rumbling in my Clo&s;et, which he hearing, was going down Stairs; but I prevented him, by opening the Clo&s;et-Door, and call'd him back. Well, Governor, &s;aid I, will you &s;till per&s;i&s;t in Grief, and yet tell me you have nothing troubles you? I am &s;orry you be|tray a want of Confidence in me, whom I would have you reckon among the Number of your Friends, and you may command every thing in my Power as &s;uch. Sir, an&s;wer'd my Governor (in much Confu&s;ion) I am con|vinc'd of your Goodne&s;s to me, and there|fore have, in a &s;hort Narrative, written the Account of my Misfortunes, which I intend|ed for your Peru&s;al after my Death; and, when you have con&s;ider'd 'em, I am well a&s;|&s;ur'd you will not blame me for cutting off my Cares with my Life. I &s;hall blame you for nothing, I reply'd, but your per&s;i&s;ting in that melancholy Thought. Con&s;ider the Task you have undertaken, that of returning me &s;afe to my Uncle: Al&s;o remember, Time works many &s;trange Cures of the Mind, as well as the Body. In common Calamities, I own, reply'd my Tutor, Time is a very good Phy&s;ician; but when the Malady is lodg'd in the Soul, and no Balm to heal it on
<PB N="34" REF="36">
this &s;ide the Grave, Time only makes the Burden too heavy to be born. However, I own there is a Duty incumbent upon me, on your Account, and I will lay a&s;ide my Re|&s;olution of Dying, till you have perus'd this fatal Account of my unfortunate Life, and then, I doubt not, but you will, out of Com|pa&s;&s;ion, di&s;mi&s;s me to the peaceful Grave. When he had done &s;peaking, he put into my Hands the following Relation.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF CLERIMONT.</HEAD>
<P>MY Family is not of the meane&s;t, tho' I was born to &s;uffer unheard-of Mis|fortunes, thro' an unhappy Pa&s;&s;ion. In my Youth, I was brought up in the <HI>Roman</HI> Per|&s;ua&s;ion; but being left to the Care of an Un|cle, a Clergyman of the Prote&s;tant Religion,
<PB N="35" REF="37">
he &s;oon wip'd away the Notions I had receiv'd from my Infancy, of the <HI>Roman</HI> Faith. But as it little concerns my wretched Life to re|late any thing farther of my Minority, I &s;hall &s;tep at once into my melancholy Story.</P>
<P>After leaving the Univer&s;ity, my Uncle took me to dwell with him, intending, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, I &s;hou'd take my Degrees, in order to procure me a Living; but in the mean time, Fate was at work. Riding one Summer-Evening to take the Air, the Sun &s;o powerfully &s;hone upon me, that I was con|&s;train'd to go to the Skirts of a Wood, for Shelter from his fiery Beams. The Place be|ing inviting, I got from my Hor&s;e, and laid me down upon the Gra&s;s, &s;etting my&s;elf to read, and in&s;en&s;ibly fell a&s;leep; but was a|wak'd with the Neighing of a Hor&s;e in the neighbouring Wood, which I found was my own, that had &s;lipt off his Bridle, and left me; taking the Bridle in my Hand, I went to catch him, but, being a Hor&s;e of Spirit, he led me from Place to Place, not &s;uffering me to come near him. I was &s;o much fatigu'd in following him, that I was con&s;train'd once more to &s;it down, and let him graze in my Sight. In a few Moments I heard the Neigh|ing of another Hor&s;e, in the adjacent Thicket,
<PB N="36" REF="38">
which mine &s;oon an&s;wer'd, and gallop'd that way the Noi&s;e proceeded from. I was oblig'd once more to ri&s;e, and follow him, and at la&s;t came up with him, where I found him playing his Pranks with another Hor&s;e, and a Gentleman whipping him, to get 'em a|&s;under; but with the Bu&s;tle, the other Hor&s;e got loo&s;e al&s;o, and away they ran together, kicking and biting each other, &s;o that each of us fear'd the Lo&s;s of his Hor&s;e. As I was going to follow 'em once more, I heard a Fe|male Voice call to me, <HI>For Heaven's &s;ake, Sir</HI> (&s;aid &s;he) <HI>if you're a Man, &s;uccour a di&s;|tre&s;s'd Woman, who is in danger of lo&s;ing her Honour, and her Life.</HI> Tho' I did not &s;et up for a Knight-Errant, Curio&s;ity and Hu|manity made me turn back, where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">rceiv'd a Woman ty'd by her Hair to the Stump of a Tree, all bloody; the Sight very much &s;urpriz'd me; but as I was going to relea&s;e her, the Gentleman that was pur&s;uing the other Hor&s;e, cry'd out to me, Villain! if thou of|fere&s;t to &s;et her at Liberty, this Moment is thy la&s;t. Turning about, I &s;aw him within ten Paces, with his Sword drawn, running upon me; I had no Weapon, therefore thought it advi&s;eable to de&s;i&s;t, and expo&s;tulate with him; but he wou'd not hear Rea&s;on, nor tell me
<PB N="37" REF="39">
the Meaning of this Adventure. I was in a very great Dilemma, between his Threats, and the per&s;ua&s;ive Rhetoric of the &s;uffering Lady; but at la&s;t re&s;olv'd, notwith&s;tanding the apparent Danger, to relea&s;e her, if po&s;|&s;ible; but as &s;oon as he perceiv'd my Inten|tion, he ran at me with his Sword, crying, Nay then, take thy Death fir&s;t. Having my Bridle in my Hand, I &s;truck at him with a good Force, and, by good Providence, &s;truck his Sword out of his Hand; and as he &s;toop'd to take it up, I repeated my Blow up|on his Head, and the Bridle being a Curb, I &s;tun'd him with the Stroke, &s;o that he lay &s;peechle&s;s, grovelling on the Earth, and I run to free the Lady. But finding &s;ome Difficul|ty, and hot regarding the Man, he was got up; and running once more upon me with his Sword (which I &s;hou'd have &s;ecur'd) wou'd infallibly have di&s;patch'd me, if the Lady had not cry'd out; yet I cou'd not avoid being run thro' the Side, tho' no more than a Fle&s;h Wound; he then &s;eiz'd me, and we &s;truggled together a long time; but he being very &s;trong, and I weak with my Wound, he got me down, and with the Fall, the Sword flew out of my Side. I gra&s;p'd him clo&s;e about the Neck, &s;o that he cou'd hardly breathe;
<PB N="38" REF="40">
but he mu&s;t have made an End of me, if the Lady had not releas'd her&s;elf, with the A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance I had given her before, who took up his Sword, and run him into the Leg, the Pain of which made him let go his Hold of me, and I got up again, &s;natch'd the Sword from him, which he had drawn out of his Leg, and &s;truck him &s;o forcibly over his Head, that I once more &s;ent him breathle&s;s to the Ground. I was ju&s;t going to run the Sword into his Body, in my Heat of Pa&s;&s;ion; but I con&s;ider'd immediately, it wou'd look like an Action of Barbarity to &s;tab a defencele&s;s Man, therefore I de&s;i&s;ted; and in a few Moments after, I fell &s;peechle&s;s by him, with Lo&s;s of Blood; but was brought to my Sen&s;es by a violent Pain in my Leg, that the barbarous Wretch had given me, in wounding me &s;e|veral times with his Penknife, as I lay unca|pable of Defence.</P>
<P>He did his utmo&s;t to reach my Brea&s;t, but he was &s;o feeble with his Wounds, that he cou'd not get any farther. I ro&s;e in a violent Pa&s;&s;ion, and wrench'd it from him, intending to put an End to his Life; but my feebler Strength cou'd not obey my Fury; therefore I &s;eated my&s;elf as far from him as I cou'd, ex|pecting my la&s;t Moments, for the Lady was
<PB N="39" REF="41">
fled, and little Hopes of Succour appear'd, we being in a Wood above a Mile from any Road. I had nothing now to do, but make my Peace with Heaven. While I was me|ditating, I perceiv'd five Men with the Wretch's Hor&s;e, coming towards us. As &s;oon as he perceiv'd 'em, he cry'd out, with all the Tran&s;port his Strength wou'd allow of, Now, Villain! thy wretched Fate approaches. Here, &s;aid he, to one of the Fellows, take that Villain, that has in this manner ba&s;ely a|bus'd your Ma&s;ter, and hew him to Pieces. Notwith&s;tanding I thought Death was near, without any farther Violence, yet I was re|&s;olv'd to defend my&s;elf as well as I cou'd, therefore &s;natch'd up the Sword that lay near me, and put my Back again&s;t a Tree, for without that Support, I had not Strength to &s;tand; the Villains, one and all, came furi|ou&s;ly towards me, but I kept 'em &s;ome time from wounding me, by means of the Sword, thru&s;ting the mo&s;t eager of 'em into the Throat. But finding my Strength failing me, I made one Effort before I fainted, and thru&s;t my Sword into the Body of their Ma&s;ter, who was endeavouring to ri&s;e, falling upon him at the &s;ame time, for want of Strength. That Moment, &s;everal Country Fellows came ru&s;h|ing
<PB N="40" REF="42">
upon the Servants of the inhuman Vil|lain, and drove 'em out of the Wood, wound|ing &s;everal of 'em; two of 'em came to me, and &s;upported me, while another that was a Surgeon, examin'd my Wounds. Have Cou|rage, &s;aid he, Sir, your Hurts are not dan|gerous, tho' your Lo&s;s of Blood makes you faint. I thank'd 'em for their &s;ea&s;onable A&s;|&s;i&s;tance, which was &s;urely &s;ent from Heaven, for one Moment longer mu&s;t have brought me inevitable Death. Sir, &s;aid the Surgeon, the Lady whom you re&s;cu'd, &s;ent us to your A&s;|&s;i&s;tance, who will be here immediately to re|turn you the Acknowledgments due for &s;uch a &s;ignal Service.</P>
<P>After my Wounds were dre&s;s'd, the Sur|geon went to examine the Wretch that lay &s;peechle&s;s, with his Sword in his Body; up|on drawing it out, he gave two or three Groans, and open'd his Eyes, &s;taring wildly about him for &s;ome time: When he found how Matters went, What, &s;aid he, does that Villain live &s;till? Yes, I reply'd, Heaven guards the Good; and the Title of Villain properly belongs to thee, who wou'd oppre&s;s Virtue, and wrong the Innocent; and thy Treatment of her and me has been &s;o barba|rous, that if thy Crimes do not draw the
<PB N="41" REF="43">
Puni&s;hment of Heaven upon thee, I will &s;eek thee out, and endeavour to cha&s;ti&s;e thee in a manner, that &s;hall &s;hew thee I have not for|got I'm a Gentleman; tho' thou art of the Brute Creation, and only beare&s;t the outward Form of Man. I'd give, reply'd the Brute, half my E&s;tate, to have it in my Power to &s;courge thy Pre&s;umption. He wou'd have &s;aid more, but the Probing of his Wounds made him faint. Before they had made an end of Dre&s;&s;ing him, the Lady arriv'd, attended with &s;everal Servants. Thank Heaven, &s;aid &s;he, the Pre&s;erver of my Life and Honour lives. How &s;hall I &s;hew my grateful Acknow|ledgments? I reply'd, I had done nothing but what every hone&s;t Man wou'd have done, or ought to have done.</P>
<P>This Surgeon interrupted our Di&s;cour&s;e, by informing the Lady, it wou'd be dangerous for me to talk much. But I cou'd not avoid &s;peaking with my Eyes, for I found my Heart in&s;en&s;ibly leaving me. The Charms of the Fair One were too powerful to be with&s;tood, tho' ruffled and di&s;order'd by this unlucky Ac|cident. After the Surgeon had dre&s;s'd the Wretch, the Cau&s;e of this Di&s;a&s;ter, he ask'd the Lady what mu&s;t be done with him. Leave him, &s;aid &s;he, to con&s;ort with his Fellow-Creatures,
<PB N="42" REF="44">
the Bea&s;ts of the Field, for Hu|man Society will di&s;own him. Immediately after, the Countrymen return'd, bringing a|long with them three of the Servants they had taken, all of 'em very much wounded. There, &s;aid the Lady, take your villainous Ma&s;ter, and &s;hut him in &s;ome dark Cave, for 'tis not &s;it he &s;hou'd breathe common Air, with hone&s;t Men; and you (continu'd &s;he) mu&s;t be Brutes like him, to &s;erve &s;uch a Mon&s;ter. The Ser|vants made their Excu&s;e, as well as they cou'd, urging their Ma&s;ter's Commands, and pro|mi&s;ing, for the future, never to be Partners in his Crimes, if they continu'd with him. Well, reply'd the Lady, learn to be hone&s;t, and Heaven will forgive you: Take the Wretch, your Ma&s;ter, and bear him where I may ne|ver &s;ee him more; perhaps he may al&s;o re|pent, &s;ince he finds his Puni&s;hment comes from Heaven. The able&s;t of the Fellows got upon his Ma&s;ter's Hor&s;e (which was brought along with mine by the Countrymen) and his Ma&s;ter was laid along before him, hardly &s;en&s;ible of what they did. But I was &s;o weak and faint, they were oblig'd to cut Boughs and make a Hurdle, on which I was laid, and carry'd to a fair Hou&s;e about two Miles from the Wood; yet, notwith&s;tanding my Weakne&s;s, I found
<PB N="43" REF="45">
a &s;ecret Plea&s;ure in being under the &s;ame Roof with a Woman, that had intirely robb'd me of my Heart.</P>
<P>My Wounds made me keep my Chamber &s;everal Weeks; tho' I had the Happine&s;s of &s;eeing my Fair One twice a Day, during my Illne&s;s; and my Pa&s;&s;ion increas'd with my Strength. One Day, before I left my Cham|ber, I begg'd her to inform me how a Woman of her Condition, cou'd be brought into &s;uch a dangerous Adventure? Sir, &s;aid &s;he, by ba&s;e Treachery, which I will inform you in as few Words as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>This Wretch (for I cannot call him Gentle|man, tho' blind Fortune has be&s;tow'd her Fa|vours upon him in a lavi&s;h manner) long courted me in vain; tho' my Father, who is now abroad, pre&s;t me very much to accept him for a Husband, blinded by his va&s;t Riches, yet my Heart di&s;dain'd him. When my Fa|ther went into <HI>Spain</HI> to &s;ettle his Affairs, I for|bid him the Hou&s;e, and order'd the Servants, whenever he came to vi&s;it me, to &s;hut the Doors again&s;t him. This Treatment put him in &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;ion, that he broke my Windows, and endeavour'd to come in by Force, threat|ning to murder all my Family. Such impudent Proceedings oblig'd me to have my Country
<PB N="44" REF="46">
Neighbours in my Hou&s;e as a Guard from his in&s;olent Fury; this was not only trouble|&s;ome, but expen&s;ive. However, tir'd with his Attempts to no Purpo&s;e, he left off his Per&s;ecution, and I began to recover my for|mer Tranquillity. Near four Months pa&s;t, without my once hearing of him; and when I did, I was inform'd he was making his Ad|dre&s;&s;es to a Lady on the other Side of the Country. The News was infinitely plea&s;ing to me, and I dur&s;t once more venture abroad, as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>One Day, my Woman that had been my Servant from my Infancy, begg'd I wou'd be Godmother to a Grandchild of hers, who&s;e Parents liv'd in a Village about five Miles from my Dwelling. I cou'd not refu&s;e &s;uch a trifling Reque&s;t, tho' it was an Office I did not take any great Delight in. When the Day came, I was oblig'd to go on Hor&s;e|back, attended with one Man-Servant, and my Woman; for my Coachman was ill of a Fever. When we came within a Quarter of a Mile of the Wood, where Heaven &s;ent you to my A&s;&s;i&s;tance, my Woman call'd to mind &s;he had forgot &s;ome little Pre&s;ents I had in|tended for the Mother and the Child; there|fore &s;he &s;ent the Footman, in a Hurry, back
<PB N="45" REF="47">
for 'em, while we propos'd to ride on &s;oftly, till he overtook us. As we came within a few Yards of the Wood, my Hor&s;e gave a Start at &s;omething, and looking towards the Wood, I perceiv'd, to my dreadful Surprize, the Villain that brought me to the Di&s;tre&s;s you re&s;cu'd me from. He flew out of the Wood, and, on the In&s;tant, &s;eiz'd my Hor&s;e by the Bridle: Come, Madam, &s;aid he, we may now conver&s;e together, without &s;caling Walls to come at you. Fear had &s;o ty'd my Tongue, that I cou'd not give him any An|&s;wer; but when I found him leading my Hor&s;e to the Wood, I jump'd off, and ran towards the Plain as fa&s;t as my Fear wou'd permit; but to no Purpo&s;e, he &s;oon overtook me, and bore me by Force into the Wood, maugre all my complaining Sighs.</P>
<P>When he had hurry'd me about a Fur|long, I perceiv'd five or &s;ix of the Villain's Servants; they immediately &s;eiz'd me, and put me before him on Hor&s;eback, he order|ing them at the &s;ame time to catch my Hor&s;e, and wait at a certain Place in the Wood, till he came to them. The Barbarian then car|ry'd me to a more unfrequented Part of the Wood, where he proceeded to fill my Ears with his nau&s;eous Court&s;hip; but &s;till threat|en'd
<PB N="46" REF="48">
to u&s;e Force, if I did not immediately comply. I try'd by all the Per&s;ua&s;ion I was Mi&s;tre&s;s of to prevent his horrid Purpo&s;e, telling him, Time might produce &s;trange things; and if he wou'd forbear any Violence, I wou'd give him leave to vi&s;it me as u&s;ual. No, no, Madam, that's only a Wile (re|ply'd the Mon&s;ter) to get out of my Power; but I'll do the Deed, and then leave you to determine whether you will &s;end for me, or no. When I found Intreaties wou'd not prevail, I call'd Heaven and Earth to my A&s;&s;i&s;tance, but to no Purpo&s;e. He then proceeded to Violence, u&s;ing the mo&s;t horrid Imprecations that he would &s;atiate his mo&s;t abominable Lu&s;t, and then murder me to conceal the Deed.</P>
<P>I re&s;i&s;ted as long as my weak Strength wou'd permit; but he at la&s;t overpower'd me &s;o far, as to bind me to the Root of the Tree where you found me; and, no doubt, had fulfill'd his damnable Purpo&s;e, if your time|ly A&s;&s;i&s;tance had not &s;av'd me. When I found my Deliverer in &s;uch imminent Dan|ger (pur&s;u'd the Lady) I took up his Sword with an Intention to have kill'd the Villain; but u&s;ing the Weapon with fearful Aukward|ne&s;s, wounded him only in the Leg; and,
<PB N="47" REF="49">
perceiving you faint, ran out of the Wood to &s;eek for Succour; by good Fortune, I met the Surgeon, and my Servant returning, who got together &s;ome of my Father's Tenants, that were Hay-making in the Meads near the Wood.</P>
<P>As we came to your Succour, I &s;aw my Woman lie upon the Ground, bleeding; I ran to her A&s;&s;i&s;tance; but &s;he cry'd, Good Madam, trouble not your&s;elf with a Wretch that has ba&s;ely betray'd you; but Heaven has puni&s;h'd me for my Perfidy, and all I ask is Forgivene&s;s from That and you. She in|form'd me, that my intended Ravi&s;her had given her 500 <HI>l.</HI> to betray me to him in the Manner I have related. I ask'd her, how &s;he came thus wounded? She an&s;wer'd me, by the Hand of Heaven; as &s;he was waiting till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">he odious Deed was fini&s;h'd, a Hor&s;e came galloping out of the Wood, and running fu|riou&s;ly upon the Bea&s;t &s;he was on, the Crea|ture, in a Fright, ran away with that Swift|ne&s;s, &s;he cou'd neither &s;top him, nor get from off his Back, till he threw her down; her Foot hanging in the Stirrup, &s;he was dragg'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ill the Stirrup broke, and left her in the Con|flition I found her in. I was &s;urpriz'd at this Treachery, becau&s;e I little &s;u&s;pected it, tho'
<PB N="48" REF="50">
it was obvious enough; yet the Hurry of my Spirits never gave me Lei&s;ure once to think upon any thing but your Safety.</P>
<P>The Surgeon, however, was about to dre&s;s her; but &s;he pu&s;h'd him from her, telling him, his Art was vain, for &s;he was that Mo|ment expiring; and accordingly, &s;he breath'd her la&s;t, begging Forgivene&s;s of me and Hea|ven. Maugre the Re&s;entment I had again&s;t her, I cou'd not help &s;hedding a few Tears for her Lo&s;s.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of my Story you are &s;ufficiently acquainted with, &s;ince you hazarded your Life to &s;ave me from the Ravi&s;her, who, as we are inform'd, is expired of his Wounds; and tho' I am a Creature &s;o far from wi&s;hing the Death of any one, that I wou'd give all I am worth to &s;ave an innocent Per&s;on's Life; yet I can't help being pleas'd at his Death, &s;ince it frees me from the Apprehen&s;ion of Suffering, from his Brutal Temper, which I am a&s;&s;ur'd never will be chang'd.</P>
<P>To make my Tale as &s;hort as po&s;&s;ible, I will freely declare to you, dear Sir, that I gain'd her Heart; tho' &s;he prote&s;ted, &s;he wou'd never wed till the Death of her Father, without his Con&s;ent; but that I almo&s;t de|&s;pair'd of, con&s;idering the Di&s;parity of our
<PB N="49" REF="51">
Fortunes. Be&s;ides, he was accounted the mo&s;t penurious Wretch on Earth. This gave a Damp to the Joy I receiv'd, when &s;he gave me an A&s;&s;urance of her Heart, tho' &s;he vow'd &s;he would &s;uffer a thou&s;and Deaths, rather than give her Hand to any one, but her De|liverer, as &s;he was pleas'd to call me.</P>
<P>During my Cure, no Man ever thought him&s;elf &s;o happy as I did, belov'd, and ever in the Pre&s;ence of her I lov'd, tho' we con|ceal'd our Pa&s;&s;ions from all the World. But my Wounds being heal'd, Decency requir'd I &s;hou'd be gone, tho' our Separation was equal to the Pangs of Death. All our Con&s;olation was in our Intercour&s;e of Letters, and &s;ome|times meeting as by Accident.</P>
<P>A few Days after our Parting, the Father to my Fair One arriv'd from <HI>Spain.</HI> She &s;ent me a Note, wherein &s;he advis'd me to make him a Vi&s;it, and endeavour to in&s;inu|ate my&s;elf into his Favour. I waited on him accordingly, but was very much &s;urpris'd at my Reception; in&s;tead of giving me Thanks for the timely A&s;&s;i&s;tance I gave his Daughter, he &s;eem'd very much out of Humour with me; and in an odd, &s;tiff, formal manner, told me, The World had been cen&s;orious up|on his Daughter on my Account, and there|fore
<PB N="50" REF="52">
de&s;ired I wou'd never enter his Doors a|gain. I found, to my Grief, there was no|thing to be done with him, in favour of my Love; therefore took my Leave, with a Heart full of the greate&s;t Sorrow. Yet, not|with&s;tanding the Danger, we continu'd our Corre&s;pondence tho' with a thou&s;and Fears.</P>
<P>I kept nothing a Secret from my good Un|cle, who per&s;uaded me to forget my Pa&s;&s;ion; but that was the only Thing I cou'd not obey him in. The Knowledge of it, gave him a great deal of Unea&s;ine&s;s; tho' he was &s;o ju&s;t, to pity me, and hop'd Time might work a Cure.</P>
<P>One Day, as I was going in Di&s;gui&s;e to the Place where I was to receive a Letter from my Love, I &s;aw in the Road, a Country Fellow grovelling in the Du&s;t; when I came up to him, he inform'd me, with a great deal of Pain, that his Hor&s;e had thrown him, and, with the Violence of his Fall, had broke his Leg. He intreated me to give him &s;ome A&s;|&s;i&s;tance. Tho' my Time was &s;hort for my own Affair, Compa&s;&s;ion wou'd not &s;uffer me to leave a Man in &s;uch Di&s;tre&s;s and Angui&s;h; therefore I caught his Hor&s;e that was grazing near, and mounting him, led him to a neigh|bouring Village, where I procur'd a skilful
<PB N="51" REF="53">
Surgeon to attend him; but before I took my Leave, he begg'd to &s;peak with me in pri|vate. When every body had left the Room, Friend, &s;aid he (for I was dre&s;t in a Country Habit) I have one Favour more to beg of you, which is, to take that Letter; carry it as directed, and for your Pains there's half a Crown; but you mu&s;t do it with all Secrecy. Tell the Per&s;on you give it to, of my unfor|tunate Condition, and, upon Return with the An&s;wer, I &s;hall reward you, by giving you another Half Crown, with many Thanks for the Favour. As a Crown was a very extra|ordinary Reward, for one in my Habit, to go half a Mile, I dur&s;t not, for fear of &s;ome Di&s;covery, refu&s;e it; therefore took the Let|ter, with Promi&s;e of a quick Return; neither was it out of my way, for it was directed to a Per&s;on that kept a Publick-Hou&s;e, in the Road where I was to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>As I pur&s;uing my little Journey, I call'd to mind the Per&s;on to whom the Let|ter was directed, who had formerly been a Servant to the Father of my Mi&s;tre&s;s; for &s;he once propos'd a Meeting at his Hou&s;e, but better con&s;idering, we found a Place more convenient, and le&s;s to be &s;u&s;pected. I there|fore began to be jealous of &s;ome ill De&s;ign,
<PB N="52" REF="54">
which po&s;&s;e&s;s'd my Fancy &s;o &s;trong, that I re&s;olv'd to open the Seal in &s;uch a manner, that the Arms (which further'd my Su&s;picion) &s;hou'd not be defac'd, if the Contents were innocent of any ill Intent. The fir&s;t Public-Hou&s;e I came at, I went in, and open'd my Letter, where I found to this Effect:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> SEND the Bearer to you, to con&s;ult how we &s;hall get that &s;cornful Minx into my Cu|&s;tody. The Ve&s;&s;el, and all things are in Rea|dine&s;s, and the fal&s;e Report I have caus'd to be &s;pread of my Death, will favour my De&s;ign. I have likewi&s;e &s;ent three tru&s;ty Rogues to di&s;patch that Fellow who re&s;cu'd her out of my Hands be|fore; for I mu&s;t have my Revenge, as well as Love, &s;atisfy'd. 'Tis but within the&s;e few Days, I learnt where he liv'd. To-morrow Night I &s;hall come in Di&s;gui&s;e, the back Way, to your Hou&s;e, and bring the other <HI>500 l.</HI> with me: Take care of Privacy in my Reception, and &s;end your Things to my Retreat, that I may put 'em on Board. I hope you have overcome that Scruple of parting with your Wife, which &s;o much po&s;&s;e&s;s'd you when I la&s;t &s;aw you. Be &s;ure to keep thy Tongue within thy Teeth, for if Women are big with a Secret, they are in Pain till
<PB N="53" REF="55">
they are delivered. I'll a&s;&s;ure you you may re|ly on <HI>Tom</HI> the Bearer; therefore conceal no|thing from him. I &s;end you this Letter as his Credentials, becau&s;e you never &s;aw him before, as my Amba&s;&s;ador. He is faithful, for I have try'd him.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Yours, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>You may judge my Surprize, when I had read this villainous Writing, and found my Mi&s;tre&s;s, as well as my&s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">, in &s;uch imminent Danger. My Thoughts were in &s;uch Confu|&s;ion and Di&s;order, that I cou'd not determine with my&s;elf how I &s;hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d proceed in this Af|fair. At la&s;t I re&s;olv'd to deliver the Letter as directed, to &s;ee what farther Inlet I cou'd receive in the dangerous Affair. I therefore made the be&s;t of my way to the Hou&s;e, where I fortunately met the Man alone. He chang'd Colour in the reading of it, &s;everal times, ex|amining the Seal very circum&s;pectly (but that he &s;hou'd have done before he open'd it) tho' the nice&s;t Ob&s;erver, even he that &s;ent it, cou'd not have di&s;cover'd the Letter had been open'd. However, I cou'd find by his odd Que&s;tions, he was not over-well &s;atisfy'd with the Bearer, ob&s;erving my Face, as if he wou'd look me thro'; I began to &s;u&s;pect he might find me
<PB N="54" REF="56">
out in my Di&s;gui&s;e, not being well a&s;&s;ur'd but he might have &s;een me when I was brought wounded from the Wood, &s;en&s;ele&s;s. How|ever, at la&s;t, he began to be a little better compos'd. He took &s;ome pains to per&s;uade me to drink &s;omething, but I inform'd him I had Bu&s;ine&s;s a little further, therefore was ob|lig'd to return immediately. He then made me promi&s;e to call as I came back; telling me, he would go along with me to the Per|&s;on that &s;ent me, to which I agreed, and went on to meet my dear Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>When I told her the Story of the Letter, &s;he cou'd hardly give Credit to it, believing her intended Ravi&s;her had been in the Regions of Death: But at la&s;t, being convinc'd he was &s;till living, &s;he re&s;olv'd not to &s;tir abroad, for fear he &s;hou'd put his wicked De&s;igns in Prac|tice; de&s;iring I wou'd do the &s;ame, tho' I had not inform'd her of my Danger. The Grief we felt at Parting, almo&s;t overcame us, and it was with &s;ome Difficulty I cou'd bring my Countenance to di&s;&s;emble my Sorrow, when I call'd upon the Innkeeper.</P>
<P>After &s;taying &s;ome time, we &s;et out toge|ther; but I cou'd plainly perceive his Mind was very much di&s;turb'd. In cro&s;&s;ing a Mea|dow, we ob&s;erv'd a Kite had pounc'd a poor
<PB N="55" REF="57">
Pidgeon, and flew up into a Tree in our way as we pa&s;s'd. I ran as fa&s;t as I cou'd, and with Stones frighted him from his Prey. The Pidgeon, not quite dead, flutter'd about the Tree, and at la&s;t fell at our Feet, which I took up. Thus it is, &s;aid I, in the World, Power, Rapine, Violence, and Lu&s;t, which &s;top at nothing to compa&s;s their wicked De|&s;ires, tho' they prey upon Innocence and Vir|tue, yet they often meet with their Reward in this World, as well as the next. That Kite that left the innocent Pidgeon in that Condi|tion, has every one for its Enemy; while the poor Pidgeon is pity'd. But Birds are in&s;ti|gated by Nature, to what they do; the Kite was compell'd by Hunger and Nece&s;&s;ity to &s;eek his Prey; but vicious Man preys upon his Fellow-Creature out of Wantonne&s;s or Re|venge. Your Reflexion, reply'd the Inn|keeper, &s;eems &s;omething above your Condi|tion, and I will freely declare, very much &s;urpri&s;es me; therefore beg the Favour to be an&s;wer'd one Que&s;tion, &s;incerely. I told him I wou'd. Why then, &s;aid he, do you know any thing of the Per&s;on that gave you the Letter, or any thing relating to the Contents? Or do you know the Gentleman who &s;ent that Me&s;&s;enger? Tho', I mu&s;t own, I abhor an
<PB N="56" REF="58">
Untruth, yet I thought it wou'd not be con|venient to declare what I knew; therefore an|&s;wer'd in the Negative. The Man was &s;ome time before he &s;poke, looking &s;tedfa&s;tly upon me all the while. At la&s;t he broke Silence, to this Purpo&s;e: Friend, I know not your Condition, yet do verily believe you are not what you &s;eem; but be that as it may, I have in this &s;hort Acquaintance, &s;uch a &s;trong Opi|nion of your Wi&s;dom and Integrity, by your Countenance and Di&s;cour&s;e, that I &s;hall di&s;|cover a very important Secret to you, upon this Condition, that you will never di&s;clo&s;e it, give me your Advice, and not endeavour to prejudice me. I reply'd, his Confidence in me, oblig'd me to be his Friend. Come then, &s;aid he, let us go out of this Path, for Hedges and Ditches may have Ears, as well as Walls, as the Saying is.</P>
<P>When we came to a convenient Place, we &s;at down, and he related to me all the Pa&s;&s;a|ges of what I knew before, concerning the Family of my Mi&s;tre&s;s, and my own Adven|ture; how the Wretch who &s;ent him the Let|ter, had prevail'd upon him to betray the young Lady, his former Mi&s;tre&s;s, for 500 <HI>l.</HI> into his Hands, and fly with him into the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> where he had a large E&s;tate, and
<PB N="57" REF="59">
&s;hou'd be &s;hrouded from the Law. Now, I mu&s;t own, the Money has a prevailing Power, and my Poverty pleads for the Gentleman; be&s;ides, I have a Wife, that has of late giv|en me Proof how much &s;he &s;trives to &s;end me to Heaven, by adorning my Brows. But yet I have a Con&s;cience for my Monitor, that every Moment tells me, I am about a wicked Deed. And this Letter I have receiv'd, which you was the Bearer of, has &s;tagger'd my Re|&s;olution; for I find, by the Contents, an in|nocent Gentleman is to be murder'd, for do|ing a noble and a generous Action; therefore, the fir&s;t thing I &s;hall de&s;ire of you, before you give me your Advice, is, to promi&s;e me you will go to &s;uch a Place (naming my Uncle's Hou&s;e) and inform the young Gentleman, his Nephew, of the Danger he is in; for tho' I have no Knowledge of him, yet I know his Uncle to be a Per&s;on who is an Honour to the Habit he wears, and has the Goodwill of every Body. When I had read the Letter, I affected to be very much a&s;toni&s;h'd at &s;uch a De&s;ign, in a Kingdom famous for the Good|ne&s;s of its Laws, where &s;uch Crimes are pu|ni&s;h'd with Death, and told him the Danger he run, in &s;uch a vile Proceeding; the U&s;age he mu&s;t expect from &s;uch a Villain, when he
<PB N="58" REF="60">
had him once in his Power, and the Reward might be taken from him, nay, perhaps Death might be his Payment, from &s;uch a barbarous Wretch, that he might have the fewer to maintain.</P>
<P>He allow'd all I &s;aid for Oracles, yet he was &s;till hankering after the 500 <HI>l.</HI> It wou'd be a Piece of Ju&s;tice, cry'd the Innkeeper, even to bite him of it. I cannot deny but it wou'd, I reply'd, but I think that impracti|cable. I wi&s;h we cou'd contrive, reply'd he, to let him run away with my Wife, I then &s;hou'd get 500 <HI>l.</HI> and be rid of a ba&s;e Wo|man that has made me a Cuckold. The Let|ter &s;eems to intimate (&s;aid I) that you had &s;ome Scruples in parting with her. That's true, reply'd the Innkeeper, for when he fir&s;t mov'd me about this wicked Bu&s;ine&s;s, I had only a Jealou&s;y of her Fal&s;hood; but &s;ince I have prov'd it, I de&s;pi&s;e her as much as I lov'd her; yet I have even conceal'd my Knowledge of her Fal&s;hood, tho' I was an Eye-witne&s;s of it. I began to inquire further into the Affair, and found he had Rea&s;on e|nough to get rid of his Wife; therefore we &s;pent &s;ome Time in Conference about bring|ing this Affair to bear, but cou'd not think of any probable Means. Come, cry'd the
<PB N="59" REF="61">
Innkeeper,, &s;ince we can't think to any Pur|po&s;e, let me intreat you to go and pre|vent the young Gentleman's Fate. The young Gentleman, &s;aid I, is &s;afe enough, for to let you into a Secret, in return of yours, I am the very Per&s;on, in this Di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>The Innkeeper was Thunder-&s;truck, at what I told him, and &s;eem'd willing to be rid of his Companion; but I brought him to him&s;elf by good Words, and &s;ome Money which I gave him, as I told him, for his In|tention to &s;ave my Life. I own, &s;aid he, it &s;eems a Mark of Providence, in my meeting with you, and therefore I abhor my&s;elf for my wicked Intention, and &s;hall never &s;et my Mind at re&s;t, till I have gain'd Forgivene&s;s from Heaven and you. We were interrupt|ed in our farther Di&s;cour&s;e, by a Per&s;on that cro&s;s'd the Meadow with a Fi&s;hing-Rod in his Hand; tho' he was &s;o intent to get over the Hedge, to the River that ran near it, that he &s;aw us not. That is, &s;aid the Innkeeper, the Villain that has &s;educ'd my Wife! my Blood ri&s;es at him; I have a good mind to run after him, and pu&s;h him into the River. Hold, &s;aid I, why did not you &s;hew your Re&s;ent|ment, when you caught him in the Act, and revenge your&s;elf? Becau&s;e, &s;aid he, my
<PB N="60" REF="62">
Blood was froze with Horror, and I had not the Power to &s;tir. Well then, I reply'd, let him alone now, for I have &s;omething in my Head that may be of Service to you, not only to get rid of your Wife, but to fecure the 500 <HI>l.</HI> too. Did your Wife ever receive any Letters from him, to your Knowledge? I believe not, reply'd the Innkeeper, for when he comes a Fi&s;hing, he generally lies at our Hou&s;e; &s;o that they have Opportunities e|nough, of Conver&s;ation, without writing to each other. Why then, &s;aid I, contain your &s;elf a little; go to the Angler, and tell him your Wife has betray'd her&s;elf to you, and forbid him your Hou&s;e. Or if you don't like that Method, take any other to prevent his coming to your Habitation; but don't u&s;e any indirect Means. Well, reply'd my Ho&s;t, I'll take your Advice about the Calmne&s;s of my Mind; tho' I &s;han't proceed in the other Affair, quite according to your Direction, for I think, after owning my&s;elf a Cuckold to my Cuckold-maker, nothing &s;hou'd follow but his De&s;truction.</P>
<P>I &s;taid about half an Hour, inly rumina|ting upon my unhappy Condition, before he return'd. I have don't, cry'd my Ho&s;t, I believe he won't come to my Hou&s;e in ha&s;te.
<PB N="61" REF="63">
I hope you have not murder'd him, &s;aid I? No, no, I proceeded in another manner. By reading a Letter he carele&s;ly dropt once, I found he ow'd a con&s;iderable Sum of Money to a certain Per&s;on in <HI>London,</HI> who threaten'd to trouble him. Remembring the Per&s;on's Name, I went up to him as he was Fi&s;hing, and told him, I was glad I had met with him, for there were Officers to arre&s;t him at our Hou&s;e, at the Suit of &s;uch-a-one. He &s;eem'd &s;urpris'd, as not doubting the Truth; and begg'd I wou'd &s;tand his Friend in his Con|cealment; therefore I have &s;ent him to a Cou&s;in of mine, that keeps an Inn about Ten Miles off, with a Promi&s;e to come and inform him when the Officers are gone. You have done well, &s;aid I; and now I'll inform you of my De&s;ign.</P>
<P>You &s;hall write a Letter, in an&s;wer to that I brought you; where you &s;hall mention, that you &s;hall have the Lady in your Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, ready for him to take her away to-mor|row. The Letter I will indite for you, which you &s;hall tran&s;cribe. And then I'll write another, as from the Angler to your Wife, to tell her that you have di&s;cover'd your Jealou&s;y to him, and forbid him your Hou&s;e; but that, if &s;he con&s;ent to fly with
<PB N="62" REF="64">
him to-morrow Night, he will come, attend|ed with &s;ome Friends, and bring her to a Place of Safety. Very well, reply'd my Companion, I under&s;tand you; and &s;o put my Wife upon the Gentleman, in&s;tead of the Lady! a rare Contrivance, if it &s;ucceeds. Come, &s;aid I, let us go to a Hou&s;e, and write the Letters, that we may lo&s;e no Time. I wrote to the Villain, that does not de&s;erve the Name of Man, in this manner:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> Receiv'd yours, and have &s;ucceeded to my Wi&s;h. I have found, by an extraordinary Accident, that your Mi&s;tre&s;s is in Love with the Per&s;on who re&s;cu'd her from you in the Wood, and &s;he is to come to-morrow Night, to be con|ducted to him by &s;ome of his Friends, from my Hou&s;e. Therefore you mu&s;t not &s;peak a Word, when you take her away, till we are &s;afe on Board. Come early, for fear we &s;hou'd meet with tho&s;e Per&s;ons &s;he expects; tho' I hope your Emi&s;&s;aries will prevent him, by cutting his Throat. And don't forget my Reward, for I am not Heroe enough to venture my Life for nothing. Be a&s;&s;ur'd, if I have the Money, the Woman is yours.</P>
</LETTER></P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="65">Ay, marry, cry'd mine Ho&s;t, as he was writing it, this will do. What I wrote to his Wife, you have as follows:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Cuckold, your Husband, met me to|day, as I was angling, and forbid me the Hou&s;e, having di&s;cover'd our Intimacy one Night, in the Arbour in the Garden; therefore, if you will fly with me to-morrow Night, I will &s;end &s;ome tru&s;ty Servants to conduct you to my own Habitation, where you &s;hall command my Hou&s;e as your own; and if we can, by any Contri|vance, di&s;po&s;e of your Hornify'd Spou&s;e, it &s;hall be your own Fault, if you are not my lawful Wife. Take no care of what you leave behind you, for I will provide every thing for you, rich, and of the be&s;t. Send your An&s;wer by the Bear|er, whom I can tru&s;t; but &s;end it in Writing, &s;eal'd with the Seal I gave you <HI>(tho&s;e Words were put in at my Ho&s;t's Reque&s;t, to &s;trength|en the Contents)</HI> and be ready; but don't &s;peak a Word, till you &s;ee me, for one of the Per&s;ons I have employ'd to conduct you, imagines it is a rich Heire&s;s I have &s;tole, one that he knows, and if you &s;peak, will di&s;cover you by your Voice. Re&s;t contented, and be happy in the Embraces of your con&s;tant</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>L. M.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="66">Right &s;till, cry'd my Ho&s;t. But who will be the Bearer? I told him, I wou'd carry it my&s;elf; while he went on to the maim'd Fel|low that brought the Letter, and &s;ent him a|way, hurt as he was, to his Ma&s;ter. We a|greed to part, but I promis'd him I would come after him, and con&s;ult farther.</P>
<P>When I arriv'd at my Ho&s;t's, I found his Wife trick'd up like a Dutche&s;s; and, to give her her Due, &s;he &s;eem'd an agreeable Wo|man. She took the Letter, with &s;ome Con|fu&s;ion, which &s;omething alarm'd me, for fear &s;he might know his Hand. She went into a|nother Room, and return'd immediately with a Bottle of Wine, and a cold Chicken, and put Half a Guinea into my Hand. Friend, &s;aid &s;he, if my Husband &s;hou'd come and catch you, and &s;u&s;pect, there's Money to pay your Reckoning; if not, it is to pay you for your Trouble. I thank'd her as much like a Countryman, as I cou'd. Upon which &s;he went out, and &s;taid &s;ome time. When &s;he return'd, &s;he gave me a Letter. Give that, &s;aid &s;he, with my humble Service to the Per&s;on that &s;ent you, and tell him, It's very well.</P>
<P>When I had got my Commi&s;&s;ion, I made what Ha&s;te I cou'd to my Landlord, and
<PB N="65" REF="67">
found him helping up the Countryman upon his Hor&s;e, and the Surgeon cur&s;ing and &s;wear|ing at the Folly of the Fellow, to get on Hor&s;eback in that Condition. However, go he mu&s;t, the Fellow &s;aid, if he dy'd by the Way. But the Man of the Hou&s;e &s;ent one to attend him to his Ma&s;ter's, and we &s;taid till the Fellow return'd, which he did in three Hours, telling his Ma&s;ter, he had conducted him &s;afe home. In the mean time we exa|min'd the Letter I brought from my gene|rous Landlay; which was to this Effect; <HI>That &s;he wou'd fly to the World's End with him, and live upon Roots and Water, to enjoy his &s;weet Company, and leave that de&s;picable Wretch her Husband, whom &s;he loath'd as much as &s;he lov'd him,</HI> &amp;c. A brave Wife, by my Troth! cry'd my Landlord.</P>
<P>When I gave him the Half-Guinea &s;he made me a Pre&s;ent of, he &s;aid, it was well there were not real Bailiffs at his Hou&s;e for Mr. Angler; for his Wife, by her extraordi|nary Bounty to the Letter-Carrier, wou'd cer|tainly pay her Lover's Debts, if &s;he cou'd any way rai&s;e the Money. My Thoughts now began to return homeward; but my Companion told me, he wou'd not leave me, till he &s;aw me &s;afe at my Uncle's, for fear the
<PB N="66" REF="68">
Wretches &s;hou'd di&s;cover me. I thank'd him, and accepted of his Company, becau&s;e I was to &s;hift my Di&s;gui&s;e by the way, and con&s;e|quently might be murder'd in going from thence to my Uncle's, for he knew not of my Transformation; neither &s;hou'd I have gone home till our De&s;igns had been accompli&s;h'd, if it had not been that my Uncle wou'd have been frighten'd at my Ab&s;ence. Therefore we agreed to go both together, and my Land|lord to lodge in the Neighbourhood of my Uncle, and both return the next Day to wait the I&s;&s;ue of our Project.</P>
<P>When we came to the Hou&s;e where I was to dre&s;s, the Per&s;on told me, there were three Men had been with him, to know where my Uncle liv'd; and ask'd &s;everal Que&s;tions con|cerning me; but, &s;aid he, I did not like their Turn of Di&s;cour&s;e, therefore gave 'em no In|telligence, &s;o they proceeded on their way. I told him, he had acted wi&s;ely, for they were Wretches that had a De&s;ign upon my Life. If &s;o, &s;aid he, looking out, be upon your Guard, for here they come, up the Lane. I had not pull'd off my Di&s;gui&s;e, therefore ven|tur'd out of the Door, keeping my Hand up|on a Brace of Pocket-Pi&s;tols I always carry'd about me, &s;ince my Rencounter with that
<PB N="67" REF="69">
Wretch; one of 'em rid up to me, and ask'd me, if I had &s;een Mr. Such-a-one? naming my Name. Mr. <HI>Clerimont!</HI> &s;aid I, &s;peaking in a Country Manner, yes, he'll be here pre|&s;ently; I wait for him, by his own Order. I am glad on't, reply'd the Fellow, for I have &s;ome earne&s;t Bu&s;ine&s;s to communicate to him, and was inform'd at his Uncle's, that he had not been at home &s;ince Morning; therefore, with your Leave, we'll wait here till he comes. With all my Heart, &s;aid I; if you plea&s;e, you may alight, and put up your Hor&s;es. No, reply'd the Fellow, our Hor&s;es are hot, therefore we'll ride &s;oftly up and down to cool 'em; and when he arrives, if you'll come and acquaint us, I'll give thee &s;omething. Thank ye, Ma&s;ter, &s;aid I; I'll be &s;ure to do it. Up|on this they rode off. I watch'd 'em &s;ome time, and found they were very bu&s;y in Con|&s;ultation. In the mean time, I in&s;tructed the Man of the Hou&s;e to go to the Con&s;table, and bring a &s;ufficient Force along with him. But before he went out, they all three return'd, and alighting from their Hor&s;es, they de&s;ir'd I wou'd put 'em into the Stable, for they were now cool; telling me, they would accept of my Offer, and wait there till Mr. <HI>Clerimont</HI> came. Well, Gentlemen, &s;aid I, for his &s;ake,
<PB N="68" REF="70">
you &s;hall be welcome to what the Hou&s;e af|fords. Come, &s;it down. The Fellows &s;eem'd a little &s;hy; however, they &s;at down at la&s;t, and began to be very free with the Liquor we gave 'em; and we ply'd 'em &s;o clo&s;e, that in two Hours, we did not want the Con&s;ta|ble's A&s;&s;i&s;tance to &s;ecure 'em, for they were all three drunk to a Degree.</P>
<P>When the Con&s;table came, I order'd him to keep out of Sight, till I &s;ent for him. I began then to examine the &s;obere&s;t of 'em, asking him, what Bu&s;ine&s;s he had with Mr. <HI>Clerimont?</HI> Not, &s;aid I, but if I look into your Hand, I need not ask the Que|&s;tion; for I am &s;o skill'd in Palmi&s;try, that I can tell things pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and to come; that is to &s;ay, in plain <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> reply'd the Man, you are a Conjuror. However, to try your Skill, there's my Hand, do your be&s;t, and &s;pare not. This Hand, &s;aid I, has re|ceiv'd in part, or will receive &s;hortly, the Price of innocent Blood. The Man, drunk as he was, &s;eem'd to be in the utmo&s;t Confu|&s;ion; yet endeavour'd to hide it, by pulling back his Hand. It is in vain to conceal it from me, &s;aid I; you, and your Compa|nions, are hir'd to murder that <HI>Clerimont</HI> you &s;o earne&s;tly enquire for, and the Con|&s;table
<PB N="69" REF="71">
is now in the Hou&s;e to apprehend you.</P>
<P>This, &s;poke with a confident Air, made him turn pale; for his other two Companions were fa&s;t a&s;leep. But &s;till, he put it off as a Je&s;t, till I call'd in the Con&s;table. Here, Con&s;table, &s;aid I, take the&s;e three Rogues in|to Cu&s;tody, and &s;ee 'em well &s;ecur'd till to-morrow. They came here with an Intention to murder me, I having &s;ufficient Witne&s;&s;es to prove it again&s;t them. And are you that <HI>Clerimont?</HI> cry'd the Fellow I had been talk|ing to. Yes, &s;aid I. Now let me know what is your Bu&s;ine&s;s with me. Turn every body out of the Chamber, reply'd he, and I will convince you, we had no &s;uch Intention. I told him, I thought it was impo&s;&s;ible. How|ever, after &s;earching 'em for Arms, and find|ing none, I order'd the Room to be clear'd. Sir, &s;aid the Man, how you got your Intel|ligence, is a very great My&s;tery to me; but we three were certainly &s;ent from &s;uch a Per|&s;on to murder you, for the Reward of 100 <HI>l.</HI> a Man; and after we had made an end of you, we were to imbark with him for the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> We receiv'd 20 <HI>l.</HI> a Man, as Earne&s;t of the re&s;t, but re&s;olv'd not to com|mit &s;o barbarous an Act upon the Innocent;
<PB N="70" REF="72">
therefore we intended to acquaint you with the real Truth, hoping you would cau&s;e the Re|port to be &s;pread of your Murder, about your Neighbourhood, for a few Days, till we had receiv'd the Reward, and our Ma&s;ter had imbark'd. I own, you may hardly find Faith to believe me; but it is Truth, as I hope for Heaven. You may perceive we have no Arms about us; and if you plea&s;e to examine our Pi&s;tols, at our Hol&s;ters, you will find they are as empty as my Ma&s;ter's Heart is of Humanity.</P>
<P>I immediately &s;ent to examine their Pi&s;tols, and found 'em uncharg'd, as he declar'd. This Proof gain'd on my Belief. Well, Sir, &s;aid the Man, I hope you think what I have &s;aid is Truth. But the more to &s;trengthen it, Pray awake my Companions, and examine them. Now what Di&s;cour&s;e we had together, was &s;poke &s;o low, that if the other two Men had been awake, and &s;ober, they cou'd not have under&s;tood us. Therefore I caus'd 'em to be rous'd from their drou&s;y Humour, while I went and put on my own Cloaths. When I came in, I order'd the Per&s;on I had been talking with, to tell 'em he had &s;een me. Well, and have you broke the Matter to him? &s;aid one of 'em. Yes, he reply'd, and
<PB N="71" REF="73">
I do intend to comply with his Reque&s;t. We are glad on't (return'd the other two) then our Four&s;core Pounds apiece is all &s;nug. I found, upon a further Examination, the Fel|lows were hone&s;t: Nay, one of 'em told me, it was not altogether the Lucre of the Mo|ney that prevail'd upon him, but to &s;ave an innocent Gentleman's Life; for, &s;aid he, if we had not undertaken it, &s;ome others might, that wou'd have gone through with their Work.</P>
<P>The Difficulty I now labour'd under, was which way to cau&s;e the Report of my Death, without alarming my Uncle; therefore took this Method, which was approv'd of by the three Men. I put on my Di&s;gui&s;e once more, and gave 'em the Cloaths I put off, which we mangled and blooded in &s;everal Places, and order'd 'em to tell the Wretch who &s;ent 'em, that they found me hunting in a Wood alone, and there murder'd me, and the Place being private, not likely for any one to find me immediately, they had &s;tript me, and brought my Cloaths as a Proof that my Bu&s;ine&s;s was done effectually. They all three gave me many Thanks, and promis'd me, in a few Days, to let me know their Succe&s;s, for they were re&s;olv'd to leave their
<PB N="72" REF="74">
Ma&s;ter &s;ecretly, as &s;oon as ever they had re|ceiv'd their Reward, not caring to live any longer with &s;uch a barbarous Wretch. Up|on this, we parted, and my Ho&s;t and I went to our Repo&s;e. The next Morning, I di&s;|patch'd mine Ho&s;t to regulate Matters with my hated Rival, and de&s;ign'd to follow. I told my Uncle, I intended to go &s;ee a Rela|tion about Twenty Miles off, and &s;hou'd not return till the next Day; for I did not think it proper to acquaint him with the Motive of my Journey. I went in my u&s;ual Di&s;gui&s;e, but dur&s;t not go to the Landlord's Hou&s;e, becau&s;e his Wife wou'd know me for the Letter-Carrier; therefore cho&s;e to ride into a neighbouring Wood, till it was dark, where I entertain'd my&s;elf with a Book I brought along with me. But I was very much &s;ur|priz'd, an Hour before Night, to &s;ee the Wretch, and two more along with him, en|ter the &s;ame Wood. I began to have &s;ome dreadful Apprehen&s;ion, for fear they &s;hou'd find me out, therefore leading my Hor&s;e fur|ther into the Wood, and tying him fa&s;t, fetch'd a Round, and came almo&s;t at their Backs; yet tho' I was &s;o near 'em, they cou'd not come to me immediately, by rea&s;on of the Interpo&s;ition of a thick Cop&s;e of Hazels,
<PB N="73" REF="75">
which kept me from their Sight. Now my Revenge is &s;atisfy'd (cry'd the Villain) my Heart feels lighter, and it looks like an Omen of future Contentment, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing that un|grateful Maid. I mu&s;t own, I do love her, and wou'd wait a Year with Patience, if at the end &s;he wou'd reward my Love.</P>
<P>You were very patient (reply'd another) when, not long &s;ince, you attempted to ra|vi&s;h her, and no doubt, had don't, if the Per&s;on who has paid his Life for his Pre|&s;umption, had not prevented it. 'Tis true, reply'd the Barbarian, the fir&s;t Fire of my Pa&s;&s;ion, I own, was the Flame of Lu&s;t; but I now begin to fan&s;y, if I cou'd gain her Heart, I &s;hou'd revel in Bli&s;s, for a whole Year at lea&s;t, without being cloy'd. But how tedious do the Moments pa&s;s, continu'd the Villain! Oh, how I long for Night! How will the trembling Slut be bit, when, in&s;tead of flying to the Man &s;he loves, &s;he'll find her&s;elf in the Embraces of one &s;he de|te&s;ts! This Wood will once more be the Bawd to my De&s;igns. As &s;oon as ever we have left the Shore, I'll proceed to the Enjoy|ment of the &s;cornful Dame.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t own, this Declaration made me &s;hudder; and I had once re&s;olv'd to draw my
<PB N="74" REF="76">
Pi&s;tols, and &s;hoot the Villain thro' the Head, if the Con&s;ideration of our Project had not hinder'd me. I waited, with as much Im|patience as my Rival did, till the Moment came of our Decampment. As &s;oon as they were mounted, I took Hor&s;e, and follow'd; but my Hor&s;e hearing other Hor&s;es before him, neigh'd &s;everal times, which caus'd my Leaders to &s;top; however, as there was but two, and I in my Di&s;gui&s;e, I re&s;olv'd to pu&s;h on, and come up with 'em. As I came even with the Wretch and his Companion, they ask'd me where I was going? I told 'em, to &s;uch an Inn; naming the Place where they were bound. This Fellow, &s;aid the Ruffian, may hinder our De&s;ign, therefore we mu&s;t prevent him; tho' this was &s;poke in a Whi&s;|per, yet I heard it plain, and began to re|pent of my Forwardne&s;s in following them; I therefore put Spurs to my Hor&s;e to get out of their Reach.</P>
<P>Hold, hold! cry'd the Ma&s;ter, not &s;o fa&s;t, I want to &s;peak with you; I have a Job for you to do, which I'll pay you well for; 'tis only to go to the Harbour, which is not a|bove three Miles off, and inquire for the <HI>Speedwell Galley,</HI> that lies moor'd to the Wharf; bid 'em immediately unmoor, and
<PB N="75" REF="77">
prepare for Sailing, and &s;end the Boat a&s;hore to wait my Coming, which won't be above two Hours; if thou wilt do this, there's a Crown; and if you'll wait till I come, I'll give thee another. Thank you, Ma&s;ter, &s;aid I, with all my Heart, if your Wor&s;hip will be&s;peak a Bed for me at the Inn, as you pa&s;s by. Ay, that I will, reply'd the Wretch, and a good Supper be&s;ide. I gave him Thanks, turn'd my Hor&s;e's Head to go back again, and re&s;olv'd to do as he de&s;ired; for then I &s;hou'd &s;ee the End of our Project.</P>
<P>When I came to the Harbour, I found the Boat's Crew a&s;hore, waiting for their Ma&s;ter. When I had executed my Commi&s;&s;ion, the Coxen cry'd, What, is the Devil in my Ma|&s;ter? Does he think my Memory &s;o &s;hort, that I &s;hou'd forget his Orders in five Hours? I fan&s;y &s;o, &s;aid I, for he paid me well for my Journey; and yet but in part, for I am to &s;tay till he returns, for the re&s;t of my Re|ward. I think the open Air is a little too cold, to &s;tay in't three or four Hours toge|ther; therefore, if you'll go with me to an Alehou&s;e, I'll &s;pend part of my Wages upon you. A few Words &s;truck up the Bargain, and away we went.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="78">When the Company were pretty well warm'd with their Liquor, I began to ask 'em a few Que&s;tions concerning their Ma&s;ter, intimating, that we had been in Treaty about my entring into his Service. Why, reply'd the Coxen, you had better <HI>&s;tand &s;till, and walk Hor&s;es,</HI> as the Saying is. I own he's good at Promi&s;ing, but the wor&s;t at Performing, I believe, in the whole Dominions of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> How comes it to pa&s;s then, &s;aid I, that you'll &s;erve &s;uch a &s;curvy Ma&s;ter? Why you know, Ma&s;ter, reply'd the Coxen, we Sailors are very blunt hone&s;t Fellows, there|fore, as I believe it is not in your Power to hurt me, I'll tell you the Truth. We are all marry'd, or have Settlements, upon his Plan|tations in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> therefore 'tis our Intere&s;ts; and as he brought us out with him, we mu&s;t wink at his Rogueries, that he may carry us to our own Plantations again; other|wi&s;e I'd leave him this In&s;tant; for I dare &s;wear, he's upon &s;ome ill De&s;ign this Mo|ment. In return to your Confidence of me, I reply'd, I can a&s;&s;ure you 'tis &s;o; nay, and &s;uch an Action, that not only may endanger his Life, but the Lives of tho&s;e that a&s;&s;i&s;t him in't. Upon this, all the Company be|gan to look upon one another, with Counte|nances

full of Fear. 'Sblood! if I thought that, cry'd one, the Devil might a&s;&s;i&s;t him, for me. Some baudy Bu&s;ine&s;s, cry'd another, I &s;uppo&s;e; I don't care to hazard my Life for any Whore, but my own. I'd venture my Life, &s;aid another, in an Engagement, in hopes of Plunder; but I'll &s;ee him d&mdash;'d before I'll have any thing to do with his dirty Work.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, every Sailor had &s;omething to &s;ay upon the Occa&s;ion; and I found, by their Sentiments, they were all hone&s;t Fel|lows, or &s;eem'd &s;o; and the more they drank, the more they &s;eem'd re&s;olv'd to oppo&s;e him in any ill De&s;ign. I let 'em into &s;ome part of the Story, in order that they &s;hou'd &s;tand the poor Wretch's Friend, that by Mi&s;take might be brought among 'em; for I did not doubt, but when he found out the Trick that was put upon him, his Brutality and Di&s;ap|pointment wou'd pu&s;h him on to murder the Woman. This was the only Motive that induc'd me to enter into Conver&s;ation with 'em; therefore, I intended to take my Leave, but was prevented by a loud Knocking at the Door. Immediately after, enter'd the Wretch, &s;wearing abominably at the Coxen, and Sai|lors, in not being at the Boat to wait his Coming.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="80">The Sailors began to grumble, and told him, they were not his Slaves, nor wou'd be us'd as &s;uch. I don't know where this Di&s;|pute wou'd have ended, if the three Fellows that were hired to murder me, had not fol|low'd their Ma&s;ter, and de&s;ir'd to &s;peak with him in private. What is it you want with me, you trouble&s;ome Vermin? cry'd the Brute. You know what we want, reply'd one of them; and therefore we expect to be &s;atisfy'd before you go on Board: You know very well, we were to have the Reward when our Bu&s;ine&s;s was fini&s;h'd; and not keeping your Word with us, makes us imagine you intend to forget the re&s;t of the Money, if we don't put you in mind of it. You Villains, cry'd out their Ma&s;ter, if you mention one Word more of that Affair, look to your&s;elves! you know, you good-for-nothing Ra&s;cals, that it is in my Power to hang you all; therefore no more Words, or an Halter &s;hall be your Reward; you have been too well paid alrea|dy. A Halter our Reward! cry'd the Fel|low, and what &s;hou'd be his Reward, that put us upon &s;uch an Action? Why, you Caitiffs, you know very well (cry'd their Ma|&s;ter) I only order'd you to Ba&s;tinado the Ra&s;|cal, not to murder him: And, you Clods!

if I had Time to &s;tay, I wou'd find out Means to help you to the Gallows. Come, Rogues (&s;aid he to the Sailors) and fly to the Boat this In&s;tant. Better Words, cry'd the Sailors, or you &s;hall to Sea by your &s;elf&punc; Zounds! we know you can't do without us, and therefore we'll be better treated; and tho' mo&s;t of your Governors of Plantations are bad enough, yet there's one gone to take your Place, that we may expect Ju&s;tice from, without paying for't. What the Devil! I &s;uppo&s;e there's a Con&s;piracy in my Ab&s;ence, reply'd the <HI>quondam</HI> Governor: Who has put Rebellion into your Heads? not you, my hone&s;t Friend, I hope? &s;peaking to me. The three Fellows not ob&s;erving me before, &s;eem'd very much &s;urpriz'd at the Sight of me, and one of 'em cry'd out in a Tran&s;port, Good God! Mr. <HI>Clermont,</HI> what brought you here? Ha! <HI>Clermont,</HI> &s;aid the Wretch, is the Vil|lain then living &s;till? I own I was very much &s;urpris'd at this Di&s;covery, but was brought out of it by his furious Approach, with his drawn Hanger in his Hand; however, I had Pre&s;ence of Mind to pull my Pi&s;tols out of my Pocket, and aim'd one at his Brea&s;t, tel|ling him, if he offer'd to come one Step for|warder, I'd &s;hoot him dead at my Feet.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="82">The Sight of my Pi&s;tols made him &s;top &s;hort, and call to his Men to &s;eize me; &s;ome of 'em, not thinking what they did, were going to obey his Orders.

When they had heard my Story, they one and all cry'd out, they wou'd &s;tand by me with their Lives. Upon this, he &s;ullenly &s;at down, and was &s;ome time before he open'd his Mouth. A general Silence follow'd; but our Eyes were bu&s;y, looking at each other. At la&s;t he open'd in this manner: Sir, can you for|give me for my pa&s;t black De&s;igns again&s;t your Life? I own, this Contrition, at this Exigence, looks like Fal&s;hood; but upon the Word of a Man of Honour, I repent from the Bottom of my Heart, of all my ba&s;e Actions; when I look back on 'em, it is with Horror! How amiable a Figure do you make, cloath'd in Innocence and Virtue! And how like a Fiend of Hell do I look, co|ver'd with &s;uch hateful Crimes! but Repen|tance, I hope, may wa&s;h my Stains away; and I &s;hall think I am in the fir&s;t Road to Virtue, if you'll vouch&s;afe me your Pardon

and Friend&s;hip: My Servants, that I find have &s;av'd your innocent Life, &s;hall receive the Reward they expected, for the Humani|ty that their Ma&s;ter wanted: My Seamen &s;hall find me, for the future, &s;uch a Com|mander as they can wi&s;h for; and when we arrive in our own Country, their Reward<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hall exceed their Expectation.</P>
<P>Very well, reply'd the Coxen, half drunk, I have heard your Wor&s;hip talk at this rate, before now. Ay, ay, cry'd another, we know his Tongue is well hung, he promi&s;es as well as e'er a Gentleman in the Univer&s;e, and performs as ill. I mu&s;t confe&s;s (&s;aid the in|tended Ravi&s;her) the Character my own Ser|vants give me, is enough to &s;tartle a Stran|ger: But what other Motive, but Repen|tance can make me declare my&s;elf in this manner? I find my&s;elf a new Man, and on|ly wonder at my former Self. All the while this Di&s;pute la&s;ted, I was inly ruminating how I &s;hou'd proceed. I was in very great doubt of his Sincerity; for I ob&s;erv'd, in all his Di&s;cour&s;e, he turn'd his Eye very often upon the Door, as if he expected &s;ome of his Men from the Ship to take his Part; at lea&s;t I thought &s;o. Be&s;ide, I wanted very much to confer with my Landlord, who I knew
<PB N="82" REF="84">
wou'd accompany his Wife, tho' unknown to her: therefore I told him, I would go out to recompo&s;e my Spirits, and return immediate|ly again. Very well, he reply'd, you are at your own Liberty, and it will be my utmo&s;t Wi&s;h, that when you come back, you will forgive one that will ever think it his highe&s;t Happine&s;s to be e&s;teem'd your Friend. I made him no Reply, but went out, and found my Landlord, who was waiting at the Door, with four or five more, all in Di&s;gui&s;e, and mask'd, attending his good Wife, who &s;eem'd very impatient. I told him what had hap|pen'd; and ask'd him Advice how I &s;hould behave my&s;elf. Damn him (he reply'd) don't tru&s;t him, for if you do, he'll certainly de|ceive you. But, however, conceal your&s;elf &s;omewhere about the Hou&s;e, till I go in and feel his Pul&s;e; for I mu&s;t get rid of Madam, &s;ome how.</P>
<P>I con&s;ented to his going in, for I conclud|ed it was the only way to try his Sincerity; for if he really repented, he would re&s;tore his pretended Lady to her Liberty. Therefore I retired to wait the Event. However, upon &s;econd Thoughts, I judg'd it the &s;afe&s;t Cour&s;e to get my Hor&s;e ready, for fear of things. Ju&s;t as I was leading him out of the Stable,
<PB N="83" REF="85">
I perceiv'd my Landlord and the Gentleman coming towards me, and, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, did not know what to think of it; but they &s;topt, as &s;oon as they were got out of hearing of the People about the Door. Why it is a terrible Bu&s;ine&s;s, I own (&s;aid my Landlord) to be di&s;appointed in your Revenge, for I'll engage he's two Miles off, by this time; for he mounted immediately, and flew away like Lightning. Damn him! reply'd my fal&s;e Pe|nitent, I wi&s;h his Hor&s;e may break his Neck. Not impo&s;&s;ible, cry'd my Landlord: But &s;ince he's gone, let's proceed to Bu&s;ine&s;s. Your Men, you may depend on't, will &s;oon return to their Duty, now Mr. <HI>Clermont</HI> has left 'em. Therefore, give me my Reward, and I wi&s;h you Luck, and a boon Voyage. There it is (putting a Pur&s;e in his Hand) all in Gold. I hope your Wor&s;hip (reply'd my Landlord) has not put a Trick upon me? No, on my Word, return'd the Villain, you are the only one I intend not to deceive; and if you'll &s;end me Word you have murder'd <HI>Clermont,</HI> I'll &s;end thee the next Return after it, a hundred Hog&s;heads of the be&s;t Sugar in my Plantations. My Thoughts were very much confus'd before, but in hearing this, I forgot all Patience&punc; I drew a Pi&s;tol from my
<PB N="84" REF="86">
Pocket, and running up, cry'd, No, Villain, Heaven has re&s;erv'd me to puni&s;h &s;uch a mortal Devil as thou art. I di&s;charg'd my Pi&s;tol at his Head; and, &s;eeing him fall, mounted my Hor&s;e, and flew away like Lightning, in earne&s;t. I rid &s;ix or &s;even Miles before my troubled Thoughts return'd to Rea&s;on; and then, when I began to think, I condemn'd my&s;elf for being &s;o ra&s;h; and thought of the Crime I had committed, in killing a Wretch with all his Sins about him.</P>
<P>I did not go home that Night; neither &s;hould I have thought of repo&s;ing my&s;elf, if my Hor&s;e had not put me in mind of it, by &s;eeming jaded; but being far from any Hou&s;e, I drove him into a Meadow, and &s;at under a Hedge till Break of Day. When I got home, my good Uncle &s;aw vi&s;ibly the Di&s;content was increas'd in my Countenance; but I wou'd not wound his Peace farther, by telling him what had befallen me; I only feign'd &s;ome &s;light Indi&s;po&s;ition, therefore &s;taid at home three or four Days, but under terrible Inquie|tudes; and what increas'd my Apprehen&s;ions, I heard nothing from my Mi&s;tre&s;s for &s;everal Days beyond the u&s;ual Time. The only Con|&s;olation was, that no Intelligence came con|cerning
<PB N="85" REF="87">
the Death of the Wretch I &s;uppos'd I had kill'd; for I was well a&s;&s;ur'd, if I had been call'd to an Account for it, the fatal In|quiry wou'd have broke the Heart of my pious Uncle.</P>
<P>I was almo&s;t afraid to go to my Landlord's (as I call'd him) tho' I had no Rea&s;on to doubt his Hone&s;ty; and wonder'd I had not &s;een him in &s;o many Days. Therefore, after many Irre&s;olutions, I ventur'd to vi&s;it him in my Di&s;gui&s;e as u&s;ual. When I came to his Hou&s;e, they told me he was ill of a Fever. I ask'd a Countryman that was drinking at the Door, concerning him. I don't know, &s;ays the Countryman, the Man's a Fool, I think; he takes it much in Dudgeon, that his Wife has made him a Cuckold; and you know, Sir, it's many an hone&s;t Man's For|tune. Now I think, he has Rea&s;on to be out of his Wits with Joy, that he has got rid of a devili&s;h Wife. By this Fellow's Di&s;cour&s;e, I under&s;tood every thing had &s;ucceeded to his Wi&s;h; but I trembled to think in what man|ner, I fear'd he might have murder'd her, to break his Marriage Bonds, and was very un|ea&s;y to know the Truth. While the Fellow and I were talking, a Maid-Servant came to me, and ask'd me, if I was not the Per&s;on
<PB N="86" REF="88">
that brought a Letter to her Ma&s;ter &s;ome time ago? I was &s;omething &s;urpris'd at the Que&s;tion, and did not readily give her an An|&s;wer. If you are the &s;ame Per&s;on, &s;aid &s;he, (perceiving I &s;aid nothing) you need not be afraid; my Ma&s;ter only order'd me to bring you up Stairs, if you &s;hould come here at any time. I follow'd her to her Ma&s;ter's Cham|ber, without opening my Lips. I found him on his Bed, and &s;eemingly very weak. When the Door was &s;hut, he aro&s;e.</P>
<P>Well Sir, &s;aid he, my Ends are accom|pli&s;h'd, tho' in &s;uch a manner, that has given me very great Unea&s;ine&s;s; for, notwith&s;tand|ing I had all the Rea&s;on in the World to de|&s;pi&s;e my Wife, yet her deplorable End, tho' it &s;hews the Judgment of the Almighty upon wicked Per&s;ons, has ca&s;t me into &s;uch a dread|ful Melancholy, that I believe I &s;hall never &s;hake it off. When you, Sir, fired your Pi|&s;tol at the ba&s;e Villain that de&s;erves the wor&s;t of Deaths, the Report frighted the Hor&s;e my Wife rode on, to &s;uch a Degree, that he ran away with her, and plunging into the Sea, threw her off. We try'd all Means to &s;ave her, but &s;he &s;unk to the Bottom, and we ne|ver more &s;aw her. It was &s;uppos'd the Tide of Ebb carry'd her into the main Ocean.

Well, but Landlord, &s;aid I, how did you proceed with the Men, after the Villain was kill'd? Alas, Sir! reply'd my Landlord, you was not &s;o lucky to make an end of him; for one of the Balls only graz'd upon the Top of his Forehead; and it is not impro|bable but the other might wound the Hor&s;e my Wife rode on, which made him &s;o out|rageous.</P>
<P>When the Wretch got up again, and found the Smallne&s;s of his Hurt, he was for pur|&s;uing you; but was prevented by the unfor|tunate Accident of my Wife. He mourn'd very much the Lo&s;s of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, as he thought; and I own it was &s;ome good Luck to me, that &s;he was not di&s;cover'd to be other|wi&s;e, for he is of &s;uch an implacable Tem|per, I don't know how far his Revenge might have carry'd him; for after we had try'd in vain to find out the unfortunate Wretch, he was &s;till upon a Project of ma|king an end of you; but I wrought him in|to &s;uch a Belief that I wou'd certainly do it for him, that he gave me Twenty Guineas for the Job, as he call'd it. His Men, in|deed, grumbled much; but the three Ser|vants that were hired to murder you, would not be prevail'd upon to go on Board, till he
<PB N="88" REF="90">
had &s;atisfy'd 'em according to his Promi&s;e. He made many Excu&s;es, telling 'em, he had not Money enough about him; at la&s;t, he gave 'em Twenty Guineas a-piece, and a&s;|&s;ur'd 'em he would give 'em the re&s;t, when he had them on Board. But, notwith&s;tand|ing his fair Promi&s;es, when their Hor&s;es were embark'd, and every thing ready to go off with the Boat, the three Men were no where to be found. They &s;earch'd in vain for &s;ome time, and were oblig'd to &s;et Sail without them. I &s;uppo&s;e his Unea&s;ine&s;s was, for fear they &s;hou'd di&s;cover his damnable In|trigues.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Ship was out of Harbour, I got upon my Hor&s;e, and came home; but was very much &s;urpris'd to find the Hor&s;e, that run away with my Wife into the Sea, and &s;uppos'd to be drown'd, at home before me. All this is what I wanted to declare to you, and wou'd have waited on you, but my Melancholy and Indi&s;po&s;ition prevented me.</P>
<P>I told him he ought to con&s;ider, that a bad Wife was a good thing to get rid of; and, tho' I was as much concern'd for the Manner of it, as he cou'd be, yet it was very proba|ble, when the Villain had found out the
<PB N="89" REF="91">
Trick that was put upon him, but his Bruta|lity would have drove him to give her the &s;ame Death, or an U&s;age wor&s;e than Death. I own it, reply'd my Landlord, and &s;ince it &s;eems to be the Hand of Heaven, I ought to be &s;atisfy'd; but even what I have gain'd by it, &s;eems at pre&s;ent to give me very little Contentment; and I &s;hould have been willing to have forgiven her, if I thought &s;he could have return'd to her Duty; but I hope Time will wipe off this Score of Melancholy. How|ever, if I can be of any Service to you in your Amour, you may freely command me.</P>
<P>I was very much rejoic'd at this kind Of|fer, and told him, it was the only thing he could oblige me in, &s;ince I knew he had the Liberty of going to the Hou&s;e of my Mi|&s;tre&s;s, un&s;u&s;pected; I therefore freely declar'd to him the whole Progre&s;s of my Love, and the Unea&s;ine&s;s I was in for not hearing from my Fair One. Well, &s;aid he, notwith&s;tand|ing my Weakne&s;s, if you'll give me a Let|ter of Credence, I'll promi&s;e you an An&s;wer to-morrow; and I &s;hall think I am doing a good Work, in endeavouring to join two Bodies, who&s;e Souls are united in Heaven. I was in &s;uch a Tran&s;port at his Manner of Speaking, that I embrac'd him with the Ar|dour

<P>The Reading of this Letter, I mu&s;t own, very much alarm'd me. Now, &s;aid my Landlord, I will relate the Hi&s;tory of my Journey. When I came to <HI>Eliza</HI>'s Father's Hou&s;e, who&s;e Servant I was, and who&s;e Te|nant I am, I went with the Pretence of pay|ing him his Rent, tho' not due this Week; but gue&s;s my Surprize, when, as &s;oon as I enter'd, I &s;aw that execrable Villain, the Captain, walking in the Garden with my old Ma&s;ter. I knew it was not my Bu&s;ine&s;s to be &s;een by him, tho' I was then ignorant of
<PB N="94" REF="96">
the Affair related in the Letter from Mr. <HI>Cro&s;s</HI>; therefore watching them, till they came into the Hou&s;e, I went into the Gar|den a back Way, to con&s;ider, as well as my troubled Thoughts would let me, what I &s;hould do. The Re&s;pect I had for you, pre|vented my Returning without delivering your Letter, tho' I knew I &s;taid in the Mouth of Danger. While I was beating my Brains to no Purpo&s;e, I &s;aw my young Mi&s;tre&s;s <HI>Eliza</HI> come into the Garden, overwhelm'd with Sorrow. I took my Opportunity to &s;peak with her, and gave her your Letter, which &s;he receiv'd with the utmo&s;t Joy.</P>
<P>She inform'd me that the Wretch, the Captain, had been there three Days, and her Father was &s;o much rejoic'd to find him a|live, that by report was thought dead, that he re&s;olv'd to force her to be his Wife, in a few Days; but &s;he bid me a&s;&s;ure you, &s;he would &s;ooner lay violent Hands upon her&s;elf, than ever con&s;ent to give her Hand to &s;uch a Mon&s;ter of Mankind. We had not time for much Conver&s;ation, for that Moment her Father &s;ent for her in; &s;he only took the Opportunity of writing with my Pencil upon the blank Leaf of your Letter, that Line I brought you. Immediately after, I &s;aw 'em

</LETTER>
<P>This Letter we convey'd to him the &s;ame Evening, and follow'd the Me&s;&s;enger, as imagining he might take Hor&s;e immediately. I let my Landlord into my manner of Pro|ceeding, and order'd him to retire, as &s;oon as he &s;hou'd &s;ee the Wretch appear, with an In|junction on him, if I &s;hou'd be kill'd to bu|ry me as privately as po&s;&s;ible, and let my Uncle have a Letter I had wrote to him, wherein I had inform'd him of every thing that happen'd to the pre&s;ent Moment.</P>
<P>Our Letter had the de&s;ired Effect; for at the Dusk of the Evening, my Landlord ac|quainted me the Groom was getting his Hor&s;e ready, and he found he intended to go alone, according to the Purport of the Let|ter. Therefore, full of the Spirit of Re|venge, I rid on about two Miles before,
<PB N="97" REF="99">
where I waited for him upon an open Com|mon that lay in his way. I never gave my|&s;elf Time to think, all this while, what might be the Con&s;equence of &s;uch an Action. In a Quarter of an Hour, I &s;aw him enter the Common. I rid up to him, and bid him &s;top. At my manner of Proceeding, he took me for a Highwayman, for he told me very calmly, he had nothing about him worth my venturing my Life for. No, Wretch, &s;aid I, I come for thy Blood, who has often endeavour'd to &s;pill that of the unhappy <HI>Cleri|mont. Clerimont!</HI> cry'd he, in a Tran&s;port, the only Man I wi&s;h'd to have met with; and tho' I have an Affair of Con&s;equence up|on my Hands, yet I will &s;tay to put an end to thy dete&s;table Life. I had no time to ask him what Arms he carry'd, not intending to take any Advantage of him; for as &s;oon as he had done &s;peaking, he fir'd a Pi&s;tol at me; it was &s;o well aim'd, that I heard the Balls whi&s;tle thro' my Hair. I was not long behind him, but return'd him one in Ex|change, that &s;hot his Hor&s;e &s;tone dead; the &s;udden Fall of his Hor&s;e, prevented his get|ting clear of the Bea&s;t; therefore I alighted from mine, and di&s;engag'd him from him. Tho' &s;uch impious Villains de&s;erve no Hu|manity,
<PB N="98" REF="100">
&s;aid I, yet I can never forget I am a Gentleman. He made me no Reply, but drawing his Hanger, ran furiou&s;ly upon me, aiming a Blow at my Head, that would have ended all my Misfortunes, if I had not re|ceiv'd it on my left Arm. I found the Stroke had wounded me very much, therefore, be|fore he cou'd redouble his Blow, I &s;hot him thro' the Head; he gave a Groan, fell down, and expir'd.</P>
<P>I had then lo&s;t all my Re&s;entment, and ran to help him up; but I found the Top of his Skull &s;hot away, and his Brains upon the Ground; for tho' it was Night, the Moon was up, and I cou'd not help &s;tanding in a fixt Po&s;ture, to view the horrid Act (as it was then repre&s;ented to my Fancy) my Hand had done. But my friendly Landlord rous'd me from my Thoughts, that I might take care of my Safety, for he told me, he heard the Gal|loping of Hor&s;es in the Lane that led to the Common, the way we came; therefore we mounted our Hor&s;es, and rid away, he lead|ing a full Speed, and I following, not know|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">g well what I was doing, &s;o full of Trou|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">re my Thoughts.

Apprehen&s;ions. We learnt afterwards, the Hor&s;es we heard were the Father of my Mi&s;tre&s;s, and &s;everal Servants, who follow'd the unfortunate Wretch, as imagining &s;ome extraordinary Bu&s;ine&s;s, by the Change of his Countenance, when he read the Letter I &s;ent him. They took up the Body, and bury'd him privately in the Chapel, that very Night. Searching him, they found the Letter that was the Cau&s;e of his &s;udden Departure; and tho' I had di&s;guis'd my Hand, yet my dear <HI>Eliza</HI> gue&s;s'd the Letter came from me, and that Imagination gave her in&s;upportable Un|ea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The next Day her Father, with all his Ser|vants, rid to the Port, to examine concerning the Affair; and <HI>Eliza,</HI> knowing they could not return till the next Day, &s;ent to my Land|lord to be inform'd concerning the Tragical Affair. Before he went to her, he &s;ent to give me Notice where he was going; tho' a dreadful Melancholy had &s;eiz'd me, and the Pain of my Wound was trouble&s;ome, I im|mediately put on my Di&s;gui&s;e, and follow'd him to <HI>Eliza</HI>'s. I met him returning, but prevail'd on him to go back with me, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to procure me a Meeting with my dear Mi&s;tre&s;s. He comply'd with my
<PB N="100" REF="102">
Reque&s;t, and my Landlord having related every Circum&s;tance of my Affairs before, I receiv'd this Con&s;olation from my Mi&s;tre&s;s, that &s;he cou'd but barely blame me for my Conduct, in the Danger I expos'd my &s;elf to.</P>
<P>We parted with mutual Vows of Con|&s;tancy, but with &s;ad Pre&s;ages of what befel us afterwards.</P>
<P>It was about this time your noble Uncle fixt his Eyes upon me for your Tutor; tho' I mu&s;t own I had no Inclinations that way; for I was yet fed with Hope, Fortune would &s;till befriend me in my Love.</P>
<P>A full Month pa&s;t on, without hearing any thing from my dear <HI>Eliza.</HI> My Landlord was forbid ever entering the Doors of her cru|el Father, and no Rea&s;on given for &s;uch Treatment, tho' it was not hard to gue&s;s. We under&s;tood <HI>Eliza</HI> was under the &s;tricte&s;t Con|finement. I was almo&s;t di&s;tracted with this cruel Proceeding, but had no other Remedy than Patience.</P>
<P>One Day, as I was walking in our Court|yard, ruminating on my &s;ad State, a Foot|man brought me a Letter; the Super&s;cription I &s;oon knew to be my dear <HI>Eliza</HI>'s; he told me it requir'd no An&s;wer, and di&s;appear'd in

<P>Near her Hou&s;e, the <HI>Severn</HI> &s;tream'd along, which you well know enrich'd the neighbour|ing Towns with her Water-Carriage.

<P>I now began to be in terrible Anxieties on my own Account, for in my la&s;t Letters from my Uncle, he mention'd nothing of my dear <HI>I&s;abella.</HI> I remember'd, with Grief of Mind, I had left behind me a very powerful Rival, endow'd with Wealth and Title, the Pride of the Female Sex; but then, I thought <HI>I&s;abella</HI> had none of her Sex's Frailties, and I wou'd &s;ooner believe the Legend of the wonderful Images of the <HI>Portugals,</HI> than think &s;he cou'd prove fal&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><P>In the Church of <HI>Bou&ccedil;as</HI> (a Village near the City of <HI>Oporto,</HI> in the Capital of the Province <HI>Entre Douro e Minho,</HI> in <HI>Portugal</HI>) is plac'd a Crucifix bigger than the Life, averr'd to be wrought by <HI>Nicodemus.</HI> It was ca&s;t up by the Sea, and when it was fir&s;t found, wanted an Arm.

And indeed, his Fortune having &s;omething re&s;embling my own, made me doubly &s;uffer with him. I had forgot to ask him who the Per&s;on was, we &s;aw at <HI>Paris,</HI> that gave him &s;o much Unea&s;i|ne&s;s; and when it came into my Memory,

La&s;t Week, my dear Brother (thy Father) &s;ent a Me&s;&s;enger to me, de&s;iring me to come to him without Delay. I found him almo&s;t expiring. When I enter'd the Room where he lay, the fir&s;t Object I per|ceiv'd, was the vile Woman's Son <HI>John,</HI> &s;tretch'd dead upon the Ground. The Sight very much &s;urpri&s;ing me, thy Father, faintly, call'd me to come near: That, &s;aid he, is the fir&s;t Part of the Puni&s;hment due to my cruel Murdere&s;s. This Morning (continu'd your Father) that Wretch, my Wife, &s;ent me my Tea, as u&s;ual, when &s;he wou'd not favour me with her Com|pany; and the unfortunate Boy, bringing an Ex|cu&s;e from his Mother, that &s;he cou'd not Break|fa&s;t with me, I detain'd him to keep me Com|pany. It was not long before the Mother fol|low'd him, and inquired, in the utmo&s;t Confu|&s;ion, whether he had drank any of the Tea? The Boy re&s;olv'd her, he had drank two Di&s;hes. I found, by her extravagant Exclamations, there was &s;omething extraordinary in the Affair, and &s;oon found we were both poi&s;on'd. In my Rage, I drew my Sword, and made her partake of the &s;ame bitter Cup, more than once, then lock'd her in that Clo&s;et, where I have heard no Stir|ring

The mournful Sight drove me into &s;uch a furious Pa&s;|&s;ion, that I drew my Sword in order to &s;acri|fice the Author of our Misfortune; but when I open'd the Clo&s;et-Door, there was not any Body to be found.

<P>This Letter put me out of Love with Life; and my good Governor gave me that Com|fort, he had formerly receiv'd from me; but had it not been for the Con&s;ideration of my Uncle, and my divine <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> I believe I &s;hould have call'd Death to my Aid. The Letter I receiv'd from her, gave me &s;ome Con&s;olation; it was wrote in &s;uch a touching
<PB N="113" REF="115">
manner for my Lo&s;s, with the Lamentation of her whole Family, and her Dependance on my Life and Love, that I re&s;olv'd to live, if it was but to thank her for her Tenderne&s;s; tho' I mu&s;t own I felt the utmo&s;t Concern in the Lo&s;s of that con&s;olative Epi&s;tle. It was three whole Days, before I inquired for the young Gentleman that brought me the Pack|et. But what was my Surprize, when my Governor brought him to &s;ee me, and at the &s;ame time told me, in that young Gentleman I beheld his amiable <HI>Eliza!</HI> I forgot all my Sorrows at &s;o unexpected a Rencounter, and my Heart overflow'd with an inexpre&s;&s;ible Joy on the behalf of my Governor. I cou'd hardly believe my Sen&s;es. What, cry'd I, dead, and reviv'd again! I mu&s;t own, re|ply'd the charming <HI>Eliza,</HI> my Story is a lit|tle Romantic: But the Obligations my Lover has receiv'd from you, &s;hall prevail upon me to relate that Part of it, which you are a Stranger to; and tho' I ought to blu&s;h at this Transformation, I am &s;ure you will forgive me, when you know it proceeds from Love.</P>
<P>After our Ill-fortune had &s;eparated us, a Gentleman of a great E&s;tate, related to <HI>Cle|rimont,</HI> renew'd his ful&s;ome Addre&s;&s;es to me, and tho' of a different Religion, my Father
<PB N="114" REF="116">
gave his cruel Con&s;ent, and the Day was fixt for our Nuptials: By the Advice of a Fe|male Acquaintance, I drank a Sleeping. Draught, which depriv'd me, &s;eemingly, of all the Faculties of Life. When the intended Bridegroom came, he was very ea&s;y under his Di&s;appointment, and &s;aid to one of his Ser|vants (loud enough to be heard by my Father) Pox on't! this had been lucky enough, <HI>Dick,</HI> if &s;he had &s;taid till the Day after our Wed|ding. Very true, reply'd the Servant, the Wedding-Sheets and the Shroud, are the be&s;t Linnen can be put on a Woman. And the &s;ooner &s;he changes, return'd the Ma&s;ter, the better. Then, with a Hor&s;e-Laugh, with|out taking any Leave, they rid away.</P>
<P>My Father was very much incens'd at his brutal Behaviour, and, as I found afterwards, repented his U&s;age of me. He prepared a magnificent Funeral, but I &s;par'd him the Trouble, in coming to Life again; and, I mu&s;t own, never receiv'd any Te&s;timony of his Tenderne&s;s before: He care&s;s'd me with all the Love expected from a Parent, vow|ing never more to force my Inclination; and &s;poke &s;everal favourable things of my dear <HI>Clerimont.</HI> But, alas! the Funeral he had taken &s;uch Pains to furni&s;h out for me, prov'd
<PB N="115" REF="117">
in &s;ome fort for him&s;elf; for, two Days after my Revival, leaning over a Balcony, to give &s;ome Directions to the Workmen in the Gar|den, it gave way, and he fell, never to ri&s;e again in this World.</P>
<P>The fatal Accident (notwith&s;tanding I was a free Woman, and Mi&s;tre&s;s of a plentiful Fortune) gave me un&s;peakable Di&s;content; for by his Behaviour to me, I began to revive the Love and Duty which his former Severity had almo&s;t kill'd. After I had perform'd the Funeral Rites, I began to think of my dear <HI>Clerimont</HI>; and being inform'd by his good Uncle, he had wrote him an Account of my &s;uppo&s;ed Death, took a Re&s;olution of unde|ceiving him my&s;elf; therefore embark'd for <HI>Barcelona</HI> in a Ship of my own (&s;ince my Fa|ther's Death) as a Pa&s;&s;enger, unknown to any one, after &s;ettling my Affairs at home. I &s;oon found you out, and had the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing the deep Melancholy growing in the Face of my Lover. I embark'd with you for <HI>Genoa,</HI> without di&s;covering my&s;elf, or ever appearing before him, but in the Night, to ob&s;erve his Sighs. Going to the Po&s;t-Hou&s;e here, I found that fatal Packet direct|ed for you, and took that Opportunity to wait on you; tho' had I under&s;tood the Con|tents
<PB N="116" REF="118">
of it, I &s;hould not &s;o readily have brought it. La&s;t Night I reveal'd my&s;elf to <HI>Clerimont,</HI> for I cou'd no longer bear his Sor|rows; and to-day he has brought me to pay you the Thanks &s;uitable to your Goodne&s;s; but, as I have not Words &s;ufficient, I beg you would take even my Silence for the Force of Eloquence working in my Mind. That &s;hou'd be my Task, reply'd my Governor; but I am as uncapable as you; for I find the Torrent of Joy pour'd &s;o unexpectedly in upon me, has made &s;uch a Revolution in my Soul, that my Body is not able to bear the Tran&s;port: Therefore, dear Sir, think your &s;elf, what a grateful Heart wou'd &s;ay, and imagine my Thanks.</P>
<P>The good Fortune of the&s;e happy Lovers, was the Balm to the extreme Sorrow I felt. I was re&s;olv'd to return for <HI>England</HI> with my Governor and his Mi&s;tre&s;s, in the fir&s;t Ve&s;&s;el of our Country that was ready; but at la&s;t, it was agreed to travel by Land, for the bet|ter Conveniency of <HI>Eliza.</HI></P>
<P>While we were providing for our Journey, a Galley of <HI>Genoa</HI> arriv'd, with a Cor&s;air of <HI>Barbary</HI> &s;he had taken, after a bloody Re|&s;i&s;tance. There were &s;ix and Thirty Slaves redeem'd from a wretched Captivity they had
<PB N="117" REF="119">
undergone on Board the Cor&s;air. Hearing there was one <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> among 'em, I re|&s;olv'd to relieve him, and carry him home along with me, after his hard Sufferings. My Governor went, according to my De|&s;ire, and brought him to me. At fir&s;t Sight, I was &s;truck with a Tenderne&s;s I cou'd not give any Account for; but after a little Con|ference, I found it was my Brother <HI>Jona|than,</HI> who had been ab&s;ent above Eight Years. I never con&s;ider'd, I had met with one that wou'd take &s;ome part of my For|tune from me; but the Joy I receiv'd in re|lieving an only Brother from Mi&s;ery, gave me the utmo&s;t Satisfaction. He gave me his Hi&s;tory in the following manner.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF Mr. <HI>JONATHAN VAUGHAN.</HI></HEAD>
<P>YOU were &s;o young, my dear Brother, when I left my Father's Hou&s;e, in or|der to make a Campaign in <HI>Flanders,</HI> that I believe you can hardly remember it. My Bro|ther <HI>Richard,</HI> and I, were both Cadets at the Siege of <HI>Namur</HI>; and tho' we behav'd our &s;elves, perhaps, with Courage enough, we gain'd nothing more than &s;everal dangerous Wounds, that confin'd us to our Quarters longer than we de&s;ir'd; for our glorious Mo|narch, King <HI>William,</HI> took that Place, held before as impregnable, while we had the Mortification of being under the Surgeon's Hands.</P>
<P>When we had Strength enough to go to the Field, the Campaign was ended; and our
<PB N="119" REF="121">
Money falling &s;hort, we cou'd not provide Nece&s;&s;aries to embark for <HI>England</HI> with the King, without making Figures below our Birth; we wrote to our Father, laying before him our Nece&s;&s;ities, and had 50 <HI>l.</HI> paid us by a Banker of <HI>Am&s;terdam.</HI> With this &s;mall Pittance, we had the di&s;agreeable News of by Father's Second Marriage; and a &s;curvy Hint, that Money wou'd not be &s;o ready for the future. This put us almo&s;t out of our Sen&s;es, for 50 <HI>l.</HI> would not go far, with a couple of young Fellows ju&s;t coming into the World, that were oblig'd to live like Gentle|men. However, to make the be&s;t on't, we di&s;charg'd our Servants, &s;old our Hor&s;es, with &s;ome part of our unnece&s;&s;ary Equipage, and rais'd our Bank to a Hundred Pi&s;toles; With this &s;mall Stock we embark'd for <HI>Ire|land,</HI> where we were inform'd our King in|tended to be at the Head of his Troops, ear|ly the following Spring; for it was &s;trongly reported, the Rebels had gather'd together a formidable Army there. But meeting an <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el in the Channel, this News was con|tradicted. They gave us an Account of the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination-Plot, and that every thing was quiet in <HI>Ireland.</HI> This put an end to all our Hopes of getting Employment; therefore we
<PB N="120" REF="122">
intended to Land in <HI>England,</HI> and &s;teer our Cour&s;e homeward; but Providence intended otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>The fifth Day after we put to Sea, we di&s;|cover'd the <HI>Lizard,</HI> and a <HI>French</HI> Privateer at the &s;ame time. We had but ten Men, be&s;ides &s;even Pa&s;&s;engers, and four Guns; therefore made all the Sail we cou'd to avoid 'em, but to no purpo&s;e; we fought 'em briskly for half an Hour; but lo&s;ing three of our Sai|lors, and two of our Pa&s;&s;engers, among whom our poor Brother <HI>Richard</HI> lo&s;t his Life (who&s;e Death had almo&s;t ended mine) we &s;urrendred, and were carried Pri&s;oners to <HI>St. Malo's</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>St. Malo, Maclovipolis, Aletha, Maclovia,</HI> is a Sea-Port in the Province of <HI>Bretagne</HI> in <HI>France.</HI> It is built upon a &s;mall I&s;land, join'd to the main Land by a large Bridge.

From this Port, in time of War with <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Holland,</HI> many Privateers are &s;ent to infe&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Channel.</NOTE>. By good Fortune, I had con|ceal'd the be&s;t part of our Money in the Wai&s;tband of my Breeches; and the Captain &s;eeing my Grief for the Lo&s;s of my dear Brother, prevented my being &s;earch'd, re&s;to|ring me all our little Equipage, and us'd me with a tender Friend&s;hip. When we landed,
<PB N="121" REF="123">
I was not impri&s;on'd with the re&s;t of our un|fortunate Men, but was almo&s;t compell'd to live with the Captain. I freely own'd to him the Money I conceal'd, but he would not touch a Penny.</P>
<P>I wrote &s;everal Letters to my Father, wherein I acquainted him with my hard For|tune, and the Death of my poor Brother; begging him to relieve me from my Misfor|tunes, by paying my Ran&s;om, which I had agreed with my Captain for Three Hundred Crowns: I cou'd have &s;atisfy'd him with what little Money I had, but he refus'd it, telling me, he wou'd &s;tay till it was &s;ent me by my Friends, that he might have more of my Company. I receiv'd but one Letter to the many I &s;ent, and that gave me Hopes I &s;hou'd have the Money I wrote for, by the fir&s;t Opportunity; but I waited in painful Expectation near a Twelvemonth, to no pur|po&s;e and my little Stock was almo&s;t &s;pent; be&s;ides, my Cloaths were pretty well wore out, and I began to fear I &s;hou'd want com|mon Nece&s;&s;aries.</P>
<P>My Captain continu'd very kind to me, notwith&s;tanding the Rea&s;on he had to the contrary; nay, offer'd me my Freedom on my bare Word, but my Heart wou'd not let
<PB N="122" REF="124">
me accept it. At la&s;t, he pre&s;s'd me to go to Sea with him; but I told him, Whatever Obligations I had to him, I hop'd he wou'd excu&s;e me, if I refus'd to fight again&s;t my own King and Country. I might have en|ter'd into the Service of a Nobleman, but my Spirit wou'd not permit me. I mu&s;t own, I had a Longing De&s;ire to &s;igna|lize my&s;elf by the Sword, and an Opportu|nity happen'd &s;ome time after, that &s;eem'd to favour my De&s;ign.</P>

<P>When we arriv'd at <HI>Tunis,</HI> we bombarded it for &s;ix Days, and almo&s;t reduc'd it to A&s;hes. There were &s;everal Merchant-Ships
<PB N="123" REF="125">
within the Bar, that the Cor&s;airs had taken from &s;everal Nations; one, we were in|form'd was richly laden. With our Cap|tain's Con&s;ent, I took fifteen Men, well arm'd; and in the middle of the Night we row'd into the Harbour, under the Mouths of their Cannon, cut her Cable, and brought her off. But the Ship's Sails being taken off the Yards, we were oblig'd to tow her away with our Long-Boat; the whole Bulwarks thunder'd upon us ince&s;&s;antly, and at la&s;t an unlucky Shot tore to pieces our Long-Boat. What became of the re&s;t of the Men, I know not, for never having learnt to &s;wim, I &s;oon lo&s;t my Sen&s;es.</P>
<P>By the Beams of the Morning-Sun, I be|gan to open my Eyes, and perceiv'd I was ca&s;t upon a Ridge of Sand, that the Tide of Ebb had left uncover'd, under a Rock at the Back of the Town, yet out of Sight, either of the Ships or Harbour, tho' I cou'd hear the <HI>Moors</HI> Voices above me. I was very faint, and found it difficult to ri&s;e; but I re|cover'd &s;ome Strength, when I had di&s;gorg'd the va&s;t Quantity of Sea-Water I had &s;wal|low'd. By good Fortune, I had a &s;mall Brandy-Bottle in my Pocket, that was of great Service in reviving my Spirits.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="126">I began to walk, but, to my great Grief, found I had above two Miles to go, upon the Sand, before I cou'd come to an Opening of the Country; and, to add to my Misfor|tune, the Tide was flowing very fa&s;t, &s;o that if I did not make ha&s;te, it wou'd overtake me before I cou'd get away. Judge then, my Di&s;tre&s;s; if I &s;taid where I was, I mu&s;t have inevitably been drown'd; and if I went on, I had no Hopes but of being a mi&s;erable Slave.</P>
<P>I walk'd as fa&s;t as I cou'd, tho' Heaven knows, with a heavy Heart: Yet, &s;ome|times, I thought as I was an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> it might be of &s;ome Advantage to me; and therefore form'd a Story in my Mind, that I hop'd wou'd prevent my falling into Sla|very.</P>
<P>When I had got off the Sand, I perceiv'd the Country about me was chiefly Gardens; but being fatigu'd thro' Heat, and Weakne&s;s, I was oblig'd to &s;it down under a high Wall of Reeds, de&s;ign'd for a Fence to a Garden behind me. Under this Shade, my Sorrows and Reflexions brought Sleep upon me, whe|ther I wou'd or no, for I &s;trove to re&s;i&s;t it; but was &s;oon (I believe) awak'd by Dirt and Weeds that were thrown upon me out of the
<PB N="125" REF="127">
Garden behind. The Surprize made me cry out, upon the In&s;tant I heard People call out to me, as I &s;uppos'd, in the <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Lan|guage, tho' I cou'd not under&s;tand 'em. I got up, and walk'd on, and immediately was met by four <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Gardeners, as I imagin'd by their Implements. I went &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively up to 'em, tho' I perceiv'd they were in &s;ome Con&s;ternation, by their Faces. We talk'd to|gether, tho' we could not under&s;tand one a|nother. At la&s;t, one of 'em went from the re&s;t, and return'd in a few Minutes with two more; one of 'em &s;eem'd to be their Ma&s;ter, by his Habit; and the other was a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Slave. I under&s;tood enough of that Language, by the help of my <HI>Latin,</HI> to let him into the Knowledge of my being an <HI>Engli&s;hman.</HI> When their Ma&s;ter found that, an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Youth, a|bout thirteen or fourteen Years of Age, was &s;ent for. This Boy, as I was inform'd after|wards, was taken in an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el when he was about nine Years of Age, going to <HI>Maryland</HI> with his Parents, who both dy'd with Grief at their Misfortune, and the Lad was prevail'd upon to turn <HI>Mahometan.</HI> I told him I was an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> taken Pri&s;oner by the <HI>French,</HI> and made my E&s;cape from 'em in the Night, in one of their Boats, a|lone;

but being unacquainted with the Coa&s;t, was thrown upon the Sand-Bank. The <HI>Moor</HI> order'd me to be ask'd, if I under&s;tood the <HI>Mathematicks,</HI> or <HI>Navigation</HI>; or whether I had any Friends at <HI>Tunis?</HI> I reply'd, as to the <HI>Mathematicks,</HI> I had no Knowledge of them, as being de&s;ign'd for the Land-Service. But I hop'd every <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> wou'd be a Friend to their wretched Countryman, in Di|&s;tre&s;s. I added, I did intend to apply to the Con&s;ul at <HI>Tunis.</HI> But the <HI>Moor</HI> inform'd me, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;ul, and mo&s;t of their Mer|chants, had abandon'd the City, on account of its being bombarded by the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;hort, I found by all his Di&s;cour&s;e, he intended me for one of his Slaves. It wou'd avail me nothing to rea&s;on with him, there|fore I was forc'd, through a fatal Nece&s;&s;ity, to accept of my Chains as chearfully as I could. I was taken into the Hou&s;e through the Garden, with &s;ome &s;eeming Civility, and had a comfortable Supper, if my Sorrows had not &s;poil'd my Stomach; tho' I eat and &s;lept alone, upon a Bed made of Rice Straw. But alas! Reflexion brought ten thou&s;and Daggers to my Heart, and Re&s;t was almo&s;t a Stranger for many Days.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="129">My Ma&s;ter never troubled him&s;elf about the Siege. Yet I had the Curio&s;ity to inquire of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lad, how things went, and had &s;ome Plea&s;ure to hear, that the Ship we got out of the Mole, was &s;afe in the <HI>French</HI> Fleet.</P>
<P>My chief Bu&s;ine&s;s, at fir&s;t, was to look after three <HI>Arabian</HI> Hor&s;es, that belong'd to my Ma&s;ter; and I happen'd to do my Bu&s;i|ne&s;s &s;o well, that he gave me &s;ome Encou|ragement; and his Son (about Seventeen) would be never out of my Company.</P>
<P>In three Months Time, I made a very good Progre&s;s in the <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Tongue, I could make &s;hift to talk with my Ma&s;ter in his own Lan|guage. I begg'd the Favour of him to let me &s;ee the City of <HI>Tunis,</HI> but he would not let me &s;tir out of his Hou&s;e. The <HI>French</HI> Fleet did not &s;tay long after my unfortunate Acci|dent; but I learnt by the Boy, they had re|duc'd the City almo&s;t to Ruins. The Rea&s;on of my Ma&s;ter's not permitting me to go into <HI>Tunis,</HI> was (as I &s;uppos'd) for fear I &s;hould meet with &s;ome Merchants that might procure me my Freedom.</P>

more than I de&s;ired. But alas! What is Mu|&s;ick to a Wretch that every Moment long'd for Liberty? or with what Fancy could I touch the In&s;trument, when my Thoughts were ever fixt upon my hard Fate? However, I was the more e&s;teem'd by him; and I mu&s;t confe&s;s, if all their Slaves were us'd as I was, they could have nothing to trouble them, but their want of Liberty. But Liberty's the Salt of Life, and nothing can reli&s;h without it, or &s;upply its Place.</P>
<P>My Ma&s;ter liv'd a luxurious, idle Life, as all the <HI>Moors</HI> do, that have not Employments. All his Time was &s;pent in Eating, Drinking, Praying, Sleeping, performing the Ablu|tion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Ablution, is a Wa&s;hing which the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors</HI> perform, after they think them&s;elves polluted by the Conver&s;ation of Women, Sleeping, doing the Ef|fects of Nature, touching a Chri&s;tian, or a Drop of Wine &s;pilt on their Garments; nay, &s;ome are &s;o &s;uper|&s;titious, never more to wear tho&s;e Garments.</NOTE>, or vi&s;iting his Wives: They were five in Number; but I can't de&s;cribe their Beau|ty, never having an Opportunity to &s;ee their Faces; but their Shape and Air &s;eem'd very inviting. I often &s;aw &s;ome of 'em at a di|&s;tance, in the Garden, with their Faces veil'd, for none of the Slaves are allow'd to &s;peak to

them; or even to come near enough to do it, would be an unpardonable Crime.</P>
<P>I began now to think, all Hopes of &s;eeing my own Country were over with me; for I cou'd not find the Means of &s;ending a Letter to my Father in <HI>England.</HI> All the Con&s;ola|tion I had in my Mi&s;ery, was, that my Ma|&s;ter never importun'd me on the Account of my Religion. I &s;pent four Years in my ter|rible Servitude, for I always thought it &s;o, notwith&s;tanding my favourable U&s;age. In the beginning of the fifth Year of my wretched Slavery, my Ma&s;ter dy'd, and his Son took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Father's Fortune. I began now to feel the Hopes of Freedom revive in my Soul again, for the young <HI>Moor</HI> &s;eem'd to have &s;ome Friend&s;hip for me. But alas! I found, to my terrible Con&s;ternation, he was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with the mo&s;t hateful Pa&s;&s;ion Man can be guilty of. He &s;oon alter'd his U&s;age of me, when I let him know, I would rather &s;uffer Death, than comply with his infamous De&s;ires. I can hardly mention it without Blu&s;hing. His ill Treatment, upon that Ac|count, plung'd me into De&s;pair; for, to be reveng'd on me, he not only put me upon the mo&s;t &s;ervile Offices, but I often &s;uffer'd the

<P>The young <HI>Engli&s;h Mahometan</HI> often gave me &s;ome Con&s;olation, by mingling Tears with me; but alas! that Tenderne&s;s was all he could give me, and that very &s;ecretly.

<P>My new Bea&s;t of a Ma&s;ter, about a Month after the Death of his Father, was oblig'd to take a Journey to look after the E&s;tate that was left him. I knew not how far he was to go, but I was inform'd, his Affairs would keep him in the Country Forty Days at lea&s;t; &s;o I re&s;olv'd, in that Time, to make &s;ome Attempts to e&s;cape, tho' I lo&s;t my Life.</P>

<P>One Evening an old Woman came to me, before the re&s;t of the Servants, and gave me a Letter, which I open'd, and, to my Sur|prize, found the following Words in <HI>Eng|li&s;h:</HI>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THO' I write to you in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> I am a <HI>Moor</HI> by Birth, and Daughter to the il|lu&s;trious <HI>Fontimama</HI> (that was the Name of my old Patron.) While he was alive, I was con|tented with my Condition; but &s;ince the Angel of Death has taken him from me, my Brother grows mo&s;t in&s;upportably tyrannous. In &s;hort, I have heard your Story, and pity'd you, before I was capable of Love; but now I have &s;een you, tho' in Di&s;gui&s;e, la&s;t Night, unknown to you, or any one but the Bearer of this, I mu&s;t confe&s;s my&s;elf ab&s;olutely yours, if we can join our Hands in the holy Bands of Wedlock.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="134">I know you'll be &s;urpriz'd, when I tell you, tho' all my Friends are Followers of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> yet I am a &s;incere Chri&s;tian in my Heart, with|out Bapti&s;m; and my manner of being one, I &s;hall let you know. <HI>Mu&s;tapha,</HI> the Name of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Youth that lives in our Hou&s;e, taught me to &s;peak your Language before I was &s;even Years old, by the Command of my late Father; as al&s;o to write your way <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors</HI> write from the right Hand to the left.</NOTE>. When I had learnt all that <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> cou'd teach me, my Father procur'd me many Books in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue: I read the mall; &s;ome I tran&s;lated into <HI>Mori&s;co,</HI> to divert my Father; among them were &s;everal Books of your <HI>Holy Law</HI> (though unknown to any one) which I perus'd at fir&s;t out of Curio&s;ity only, but found &s;o much &s;ound Truth, and pure Divinity, that I began to abhor the Ab&s;urdities of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and by degrees, I hope I am come to a State of Salvation, thro' the Blood of your Prophet, that &s;uffer'd on the Cro&s;s to &s;ave his Followers, that truly believe in him.

</LETTER></P>
<P>Imagine, dear Brother, the Plea&s;ure that fill'd my Mind at the Reading of this Letter; but I mu&s;t own they proceeded from the Hopes of my Liberty, for Love had never yet laid hold of my Heart.</P>
<P>In the Evening, when the Servants came about me as u&s;ual, they were amaz'd to find me &s;o merry. I &s;ung &s;everal <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Love-Songs, that I had learnt among 'em, for their Language is very Poetical; and &s;everal <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
<PB N="134" REF="136">
ones, that touch'd upon my own Circum|&s;tances, which very much delighted 'em. In &s;hort, we &s;pent the Evening in Plea&s;ure and Mirth.</P>
<P>I went to re&s;t with a Mind far more at Ea&s;e than u&s;ual; but had not &s;lept long, before I was awak'd with a gentle Rapping at my Cell Door. When I open'd it, I perceiv'd the old Matron that brought me the Letter. Come, &s;aid &s;he (in the <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Language, very &s;oftly) put on your Cloaths, and follow me from <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Hell, into Paradi&s;e; I'll be your Conductor, tho' a Chri&s;tian, as well as your&s;elf. I dre&s;s'd my&s;elf, with a Confu|&s;ion of Thought I had never felt before. I follow'd my Conductre&s;s, without well know|ing what I was about; and entred into a lower Room of a Summer-Hou&s;e, at the bottom of the Garden, in the Dark, where I heard the &s;weete&s;t Voice I ever heard in my Life (the Sound went quite thro' my Soul, and &s;et my Body in a Tremble) bid the She-Slave make fa&s;t the Door, &s;aid the Lady, and light up Tapers. She in&s;tantly obey'd, and &s;hew'd me the mo&s;t amiable young Creature, my Eyes ever beheld. I &s;tood like one chang'd into a Statue with Admiration, and I was not able to utter a Word for &s;ome time. I kneel'd down
<PB N="135" REF="137">
before her, and ki&s;s'd her Sleeve <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Sleeves of the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors</HI> hang down ve|ry low, and by Kneeling, and Ki&s;&s;ing them, is expre&s;s'd the mo&s;t profound Submi&s;&s;ion, either to Man or Wo|man.</NOTE>. But &s;he gently rais'd me up, with the mo&s;t obliging Smile imaginable. What, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, mu&s;t I, again&s;t the Cu&s;tom of your Country, de|clare my Pa&s;&s;ion for you, and not have a &s;in|gle Word in return? I reply'd, the Sight of &s;uch an unexpected Angel, might well take all my Faculties away. Come, &s;aid &s;he, &s;it down, and partake of a &s;mall Repa&s;t I have prepar'd for you, and chear your Spirits with a Cup of Wine; tho' I drink none my&s;elf (not out of any Re&s;pect to the Prophet <HI>Ma|homet,</HI> but that I never was accu&s;tom'd to it) I know you <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentlemen make it your common Drink. I begg'd to be excus'd from either, neither could I indeed, for the Sight of her, fill'd my Soul with a Profu&s;ion of Delight. [And, dear Brother, you mu&s;t love, like me, before you can gue&s;s at the &s;oft thrilling Plea&s;ure that ran thro' my Blood.] I won't detain you with the tender things we &s;aid to each other. But &s;ure, Novels and Ro|mances can't produce you a Heroe that ever was &s;o much &s;truck at the fir&s;t Sight of his
<PB N="136" REF="138">
adorable Mi&s;tre&s;s; 'twas then I wore the dou|ble Chains, of Love and Bondage. In &s;hort, we exchang'd our Hearts, and gave one ano|ther A&s;&s;urances of eternal Fidelity, that can never be &s;haken on my Part, or I believe on hers.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t beg Leave to recover my&s;elf from this Tenderne&s;s, not altogether becoming a Man, before I can pur&s;ue the Thread of my uncomfortable Story.</P>
<P>Several Evenings were pa&s;t thus delightful|ly, during the Ab&s;ence of her Brother. We had many Schemes to &s;et us at Liberty; and at la&s;t agreed, I &s;hould have a Sufficiency from her to pay my Ran&s;om, tho' it &s;hou'd amount to ten thou&s;and Crowns; and when I had got my Liberty, &s;he wou'd find Means to make her E&s;cape to me. I mu&s;t own, tho' it was a Proof of the Sincerity of her Love, I made many Scruples of receiving Money from her; but &s;he a&s;&s;ur'd me, &s;he wou'd make u&s;e of none but her own. She had prevail'd on her Father to &s;ettle a &s;ufficient Fortune upon her, tho' very uncu&s;tomary, that &s;he might ever live a &s;ingle Life; tho' her only Rea&s;on was, &s;he never wou'd join in Marriage with one contrary to her own Religion; and her Fa|ther being infinitely fond of her (not know|ing
<PB N="137" REF="139">
her true Motive) gave into her Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;ecretly, the Value of Twenty Thou&s;and Pounds, <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Money, be&s;ides &s;everal rich Jewels. The Thoughts of &s;o much unexpect|ed Happine&s;s, gave another Turn to my Looks, which I could not hide; but I made the Servants and Slaves believe, the Ab&s;ence of my Ma&s;ter occa&s;ion'd the Alteration.</P>
<P>A <HI>Jew</HI> was pitch'd upon to tran&s;act the Affair, who are a &s;ort of People in that Country, us'd to all manner of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and of the utmo&s;t Secrecy, when Money ties up their Tongues. This <HI>Jew</HI> was to bargain with my Ma&s;ter for my Freedom, as cheap as he cou'd, and to have two hundred and fifty Crowns, when the Affair was compleated&punc; He knew nothing of <HI>Fatima</HI> (that is the Name of my divine Mi&s;tre&s;s) for the Bargain was made by the old Woman.</P>
<P>One Day, when I was plea&s;ing my&s;elf with the Thoughts of my coming Happine&s;s, my Ma&s;ter arriv'd, even twenty Days before he was expected. The Moment he came in, I was order'd before him. Here, &s;aid he, in the <HI>Arabian</HI> Tongue (to a <HI>Moor</HI> that was with him) is the &s;urly Slave I told you of, he's yours now, u&s;e him like a Dog, as he de|&s;erves! and take him from my Sight this Mo|ment.
<PB N="138" REF="140">
Upon the In&s;tant, I was loaden with Chains, and by &s;everal Slaves, forc'd to fol|low my new Ma&s;ter. I was in &s;uch a Surpri&s;e, that I had not open'd my Mouth, till we had got a good di&s;tance from the Hou&s;e. I then de&s;ir'd &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively, to &s;peak to him. I in|form'd him there was Money come from my Friends, and now in the Hands of <HI>Ben Addi</HI> the <HI>Jew,</HI> to pay for my Ran&s;om. He told me, he would talk with me about it when he came back from his Voyage. I was thunder|&s;truck at his An&s;wer, and endeavour'd to &s;often him, but in vain, for we never &s;topt till we came on Board a Galley that lay in the Road of <HI>Tunis,</HI> and in two Hours afterwards put to Sea.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I came on Board, I was chain'd to an Oar, and if I did not do as I &s;hou'd do, I was taught with many unmerciful Blows. I endeavour'd to put an end to my mi&s;erable Life, with my Irons, but was prevented with another Cha&s;ti&s;ement. The Thoughts of my dear <HI>Fatima,</HI> made me more outragious, and I was re&s;olv'd to &s;tarve my&s;elf to Death. I exclaim'd again&s;t Fortune, my old Ma&s;ter, and my new one, in the <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Language, in hope it might provoke the latter to put an end to my Life. But in&s;tead of that, he came
<PB N="139" REF="141">
to me, de&s;iring I wou'd have Patience; tell|ing me, I'll treat with you for your Ran&s;om now; and I &s;wear by <HI>Mahomet,</HI> when I come back, and you pay me what I agree with you for, you &s;hall that Moment have your Liber|ty. This Promi&s;e compos'd me a little, for the <HI>Moors</HI> never fal&s;ify their Words, when they &s;wear by their Prophet. I begg'd his Pardon for the Rudene&s;s of my Tongue, and promis'd to do my Duty quietly for the fu|ture. We agreed for Five Hundred Crowns, and I proffer'd him Fifty more if he wou'd relea&s;e me from my hard Labour. He told me he cou'd not do that, becau&s;e he &s;hould want one to &s;upply my Place: He farther ad|ded, if I cou'd &s;trike up a Bargain with any of the Sailors, and do what I could in the Room of the Per&s;on that wou'd undertake it, he wou'd freely give his Con&s;ent; but not one of the <HI>Moors</HI> would li&s;ten to the Propo&s;al; at la&s;t, the Gunner's Mate agreed with me for Twenty Crowns, provided I wou'd rea&s;&s;ume my Oar when we came to any Engagement. The Bargain being &s;truck, my Chains were taken off, and I agreed with the Captain, my Ma&s;ter (who was a <HI>Sicilian</HI> Renagado) to eat at his Table for the other Thirty Crowns. This wou'd not have been comply'd with, had
<PB N="140" REF="142">
he been a natural <HI>Moor,</HI> for they never eat with the Chri&s;tians; but Renegadoes are not &s;o &s;crupulous.</P>
<P>We were out two Months, before we met with any Ship of <HI>Europe</HI>; but near the Coa&s;t of <HI>Alicant,</HI> we encounter'd an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant-Ship, that prov'd too hard for us, di&s;abling our Galley, and killing and wounding above Fifty of our Men; &s;o that at la&s;t, our Captain thought fit to give over the Attempt. He re|&s;olv'd to go back to <HI>Tunis,</HI> to refit. But the next Day, a violent Storm took us, which, la&s;ting eight Days, we were drove out of our Cour&s;e; and when it abated, we found our &s;elves near the I&s;land of <HI>Cor&s;ica.</HI> Several Re|negadoes advis'd the Captain to make a De|&s;cent, and &s;eize &s;ome of the Inhabitants, in order to better their Voyage, which he comply'd with; tho' much to my Sorrow, to be &s;o long ab&s;ent from <HI>Tunis.</HI></P>
<P>Turning a Point of Land, we di&s;cover'd a Galley of <HI>Genoa,</HI> preparing, in a great Hurry, to attack us; we endeavour'd to get away, but to no Purpo&s;e, for they came up with us, and after a de&s;perate Engagement, took us, tho' with great Lo&s;s on both Sides; neither do I believe we had &s;ubmitted, if our Captain had not been kill'd; for, I think, I never &s;aw a

And &s;ure, never any Pri&s;oner rejoic'd le&s;s at his Li|berty, than I do; and if I had not met with you, that gives me all the Joy I am capable of feeling, without my dear <HI>Fatima,</HI> I believe my Sorrows wou'd have made an end of my mi&s;erable Life. Nay, as it is, I can never be happy without her. We condol'd with my Brother &s;ome time, at his melancholy Rela|tion; and I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I felt &s;o much, that my Heart prompted me to think of attempt|ing to bring off the Object of his De&s;ires. When I communicated my Thoughts to my Brother, he was tran&s;ported. We were &s;eve|ral Days, before we cou'd light upon a Pro|ject that &s;eem'd rea&s;onable. At la&s;t, we de|termin'd to hire a <HI>Tartane,</HI> and engage about a Dozen re&s;olute Men, who &s;hou'd be all di&s;|guis'd in <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Habits. We got a broad flat-bottom'd Boat built on purpo&s;e, &s;ome|thing like our Ferry-Boats in <HI>England,</HI> only with higher Sides, and not &s;o heavy. With the&s;e, we intended to &s;ail for <HI>Tunis,</HI> anchor
<PB N="142" REF="144">
as near as we cou'd to the long Sand-Bank be|hind the Rocks, my Brother mention'd, where he was thrown out of the Long-Boat; then with our flat-bottom Boat, land as near the Hou&s;e of <HI>Fatima</HI>'s Brother, as we cou'd, and bring her away by Force.</P>
<P>My Brother and Governor lik'd the De&s;ign very well, and wou'd make one in it, even with the Con&s;ent of the fair <HI>Eliza,</HI> who was re&s;olv'd her dear <HI>Clerimont</HI> &s;hou'd partake of whatever Fortune befell us; nay, it was hard|ly in our Power to prevent her going along with us. We hir'd a Ve&s;&s;el, and got our Boat ready, but we had much Difficulty to get Men; &s;ome of the Slaves were &s;olicited (I mean, tho&s;e that were &s;et at Liberty with my Brother) but none wou'd venture near the <HI>Bar|bary</HI> Coa&s;t again, willingly. At la&s;t, by great Rewards, I pickt out Seven <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> and Four <HI>Genoe&s;e,</HI> that promis'd to &s;acrifice their Lives for us.</P>
<P>We embark'd with a favourable Wind, and arriv'd in the Latitude of <HI>Tunis</HI> in twelve Days; but we did not think it proper to come too near till it was dark. When Night ap|pear'd, we made for the Shore, and anchor'd within half a Mile of the Sand; then getting our flat-bottom'd Boat out, my Brother, my
<PB N="143" REF="145">
Governor, my&s;elf, and Nine of our Men, got into it, every one arm'd with two Brace of Pi&s;tols, a Cutla&s;s, and a &s;hort Dagger; but we were not got above half a Mile from the Ship, ere we &s;truck on the Sands; tho' we &s;uffer'd no Damage, becau&s;e the Sea was very calm. But the Tide flowing, our Boat float|ed again in half an Hour. When we came near the Shore, we left off Rowing, and &s;et her forward with Poles got for that Purpo&s;e, that we might not be di&s;cover'd by the Noi&s;e of our Oars. We &s;oon landed at the Place my Brother purpos'd; two of our Men we left to &s;ecure the Boat, and keep her even with the Water, as the Tide ebb'd away. We then &s;et forward, led by my Brother. When we came near the Place, a great Ma&s;tiff Dog open'd &s;o loud, that he might be heard even to the City of <HI>Tunis.</HI> But my Brother being foremo&s;t, and knowing him, call'd him by his Name; but the poor Creature's Joy to &s;ee him, was almo&s;t as loud as his Barking.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the Hou&s;e was alarm'd, for we cou'd &s;ee Torches waving too and fro in the Garden. However, we encourag'd one ano|ther, and went boldly on to the Gate. Ju&s;t as we came to it, it flew open, and a young <HI>Moor</HI> flew from us like Lightning. We did
<PB N="144" REF="146">
not care to lo&s;e time in pur&s;uing him, but pre&s;s'd in, &s;till following my Brother, who led us into the very Court-yard. The fir&s;t he met &s;eem'd to be a Per&s;on of Di&s;tinction, by the Richne&s;s of his Dre&s;s. He was follow'd by &s;even or eight Servants. When he came up to my Brother, he made a Stop, and &s;ome Words pa&s;&s;ing between 'em, in the <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Tongue, the <HI>Moor</HI> immediately fir'd a Pi&s;tol at him. We thought we had no Time to lo&s;e, but fell upon 'em like &s;o many Furies, kill'd two or three of 'em, and immediately di&s;|pers'd the re&s;t. But as we were following my Brother into the Hou&s;e, we perceiv'd him faint, and fall Speechle&s;s upon the Ground. While we were examining his Wound, a love|ly young Creature came running to us, all in Di&s;order, crying in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> If you are Chri|&s;tians, protect me. I did not doubt but this was the fair <HI>Fatima,</HI> by her extraordinary Beauty, and &s;peaking <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>; therefore or|der'd my Brother, who was &s;hot quite thro' the Thigh, to be put in a Wheel-barrow, and immediately carry'd to the Boat. We had put our Handkerchiefs into the Wound, and &s;topt the Bleeding, but he had not reco|ver'd his Sen&s;es. We immediately follow'd, with the amiable Chri&s;tian <HI>Moor,</HI> but were
<PB N="145" REF="147">
forc'd to turn about to defend our&s;elves again&s;t the Per&s;on that fir'd at my Brother, and his Slaves that he had once more rally'd. He call'd to us in a prodigious Fury, but we un|der&s;tood him not. He made a Stroke at my Head with his Scimitar, that wou'd have in|fallibly ended my Days, if I had not receiv'd it on the Hilt of my Sabre; but I ended his Fury, by &s;hooting him dead at my Feet.</P>
<P>The Slaves, &s;eeing their Ma&s;ter fall, ran yelling back again into the Garden. I took up his Scimitar, and made the be&s;t of my way after our People&punc; When we came to our Boat, we pu&s;h'd away, as fa&s;t as ever we cou'd, for there was no Time to be lo&s;t; we cou'd ea&s;i|ly perceive the City was alarm'd, by the fi|ring of &s;everal Guns, and the Lights that gleam'd over the Points of the Rocks. We imagin'd the young <HI>Turk</HI> that ru&s;h'd out of the Garden, when we were going in, had gi|ven Notice to the City, which we &s;uppos'd to be the young <HI>Engli&s;h Mahometan,</HI> my Brother mention'd in his Relation.</P>
<P>One of the Two, we left to look after the Boat, was a <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> Surgeon, who immedi|ately dre&s;s'd my Brother's Wound, as well as he cou'd in the Dark, but he cou'd not a&s;|&s;ure me, whether there was any Danger or no,
<PB N="146" REF="148">
till he came to have Light enough to exa|mine it more circum&s;pectly.</P>
<P>The Confu&s;ion we were all in, did not per|mit us to take Notice of a young <HI>Moor</HI> that was in the Boat with us. I ask'd the Surgeon, and the other <HI>Genoe&s;e,</HI> that were left to look after the Boat, how the Youth came there? He told me, not long after we landed, he walk'd after us, to li&s;ten if he cou'd hear any thing, and perceiving this young Spark com|ing towards him, with a great deal of Preci|pitation, he thought it was his be&s;t way to &s;e|cure him, for fear he might alarm the Coun|try. I was loth, continu'd the Surgeon, to fire upon him, not knowing but there might be People near us, therefore re&s;olv'd to en|gage him with my Cutla&s;s; but as I was go|ing to a&s;&s;ault him, he fell upon his Knees, and &s;poke in &s;uch a be&s;eeching Accent (tho' I did not under&s;tand a Word of his Di&s;cour&s;e) that I cou'd not have the Heart to hurt him; therefore &s;ecur'd him in the Boat, and in the Hurly-burly quite forgot him; for, I think, his &s;eeming Innocency, and his Tears, which have never ceas'd &s;ince he has been with us, wou'd have prevail'd upon me to have &s;et him at Liberty.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="149">I &s;poke to him in <HI>Lingua Franca</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lingua Franca,</HI> is a compound Speech, generally under&s;tood by the <HI>Moors</HI> on the Sea Coa&s;ts, as well as tho&s;e on the Sea Coa&s;ts of <HI>Italy, France,</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> mo&s;t Parts of the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> the <HI>Helle&s;pont,</HI> and ad|jacent I&s;lands.</NOTE>, and <HI>Italian,</HI> all the Tongues I am Ma&s;ter of, but he did not under&s;tand me.</P>
<P>All this time my Brother lay Sen&s;ele&s;s, and his Condition almo&s;t brought me to De&s;pair; but the Surgeon comforted me, by telling us, as &s;oon as we came on Board, he had Cor|dials that wou'd re&s;tore him, for he a&s;&s;ur'd me he was not dead. I comforted the Fair <HI>Fatima</HI> (as I thought her to be) as well as I could; but judge my Surprize, when &s;he gave me &s;uch An&s;wers, that a&s;&s;ur'd me &s;he was not her we had ventur'd our Lives for: The Knowledge of this, almo&s;t made me lo&s;e my Sen&s;es. I rav'd, and tore my Hair, and wou'd have thrown my&s;elf into the Sea, in order to &s;wim back to the Shore, and recover her, or lo&s;e my Life: But it cou'd not be; for ju&s;t as we got on Board our Ve&s;&s;el, we perceiv'd a <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Galley coming out of the Port; we cut our Anchor, and made all the Sail we cou'd to get from 'em; and, as if Heaven took our Parts, a brisk Gale aro&s;e,
<PB N="148" REF="150">
that was fair for our Purpo&s;e, &s;o that when the Morning dawn'd, we lo&s;t Sight of her.</P>
<P>In the mean time, my Brother came to his Sen&s;es; but when he learn'd that we had fail'd of our Purpo&s;e, he &s;woon'd again, and every body thought he wou'd have expir'd; it was a full Hour before he open'd his Eyes, but then utter'd &s;uch Complaints, as melted us in|to Pity, that under&s;tood him. The Surgeon, my Governor, and I, were all &s;tanding about him, per&s;uading him to be dre&s;s'd; but he utterly refus'd it: No, &s;aid he, &s;ince my dear <HI>Fatima</HI> is lo&s;t for ever, 'tis in vain to think of per&s;uading me to live. Immediately after this, we were &s;urpris'd to &s;ee the young <HI>Moor</HI> ru&s;h into the Cabbin, and looking &s;tedfa&s;tly on my Brother, give a great Shriek, and fall &s;en&s;ele&s;s at my Feet. My Brother, turning his heavy Eyes that way, cry'd out, Oh Hea|vens! what do I &s;ee? Why wou'd you u&s;e me thus cruelly? We &s;oon under&s;tood, by his Tran&s;ports, that the di&s;guis'd Youth was his lovely <HI>Fatima.</HI></P>
<P>Our Joys were now as extravagant as our Sorrows were before. She &s;oon came to her|&s;elf, and running to the Bed where my Bro|ther lay, fainted away again. No Words, I am &s;ure, cou'd have the Force to di&s;cover &s;o
<PB N="149" REF="151">
&s;incere a Pa&s;&s;ion; and we all wept for Joy, to &s;ee &s;uch Tenderne&s;s. It was &s;ome time before their Tran&s;ports had Lei&s;ure to mind tho&s;e about 'em; and it wou'd have continu'd longer, if the Surgeon had not let us know, it might endanger my Brother's Life. There|fore I prevail'd upon her to withdraw, while his Wound was dre&s;s'd. I then went to make my Compliments to the other Lady, who was &s;till upon Deck in the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion; for I mu&s;t own, the Di&s;appointment we &s;up|pos'd &s;he had occa&s;ion'd, made me entirely neglect her. I &s;oon made her ea&s;y, and let her into &s;ome Part of our Story; and began to inquire, what &s;trange Fortune had brought her to tho&s;e Circum&s;tances we found her in. She related to us her &s;hort Story, as fol|lows:</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I am Daughter to an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant, that has re&s;ided upwards of Ten Years at <HI>Leghorn.</HI> My Father had contract|ed me to one of his Countrymen that liv'd at <HI>Naples:</HI> He came to <HI>Leghorn</HI> to &s;ee me, we lik'd each other, and were marry'd. My Hus|band being oblig'd to go to <HI>Venice</HI> by Land, I was embark'd in a <HI>Felucca</HI> for <HI>Naples</HI>; but a Storm came upon us, that drove us from
<PB N="150" REF="152">
our Cour&s;e. We were taken by a <HI>Cor&s;air</HI> of <HI>Tunis,</HI> where I was &s;old to a young <HI>Moor,</HI> who intended me for his <HI>Seraglio.</HI> But I was re&s;olv'd &s;ooner to &s;uffer Death, than yield to his Embraces. La&s;t Night, he was re&s;olv'd to force me, if I wou'd not comply willingly to his ba&s;e De&s;ires, and was going to execute his horrible Purpo&s;e, the Moment you enter'd the Garden; but the Cries of his Slaves a|larming him, he ran to his Arms, and left me. I hearing the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue &s;poke a|mong you, hop'd you might be Chri&s;tians di&s;guis'd (as it prov'd) therefore re&s;olv'd to put my&s;elf in your Hands, not knowing any thing of the Mi&s;take, which Heaven has, I hope, brought to a joyful End. I &s;hall ever acknowledge the Ble&s;&s;ing I have receiv'd from you; and I am a&s;&s;ur'd, both my Father and Husband will return you &s;uitable Thanks for redeeming me from Infamy and Slavery; and if you think fit to put my Ran&s;om at Ten Thou&s;and Crowns, I'll engage it &s;hall be paid, either at <HI>Leghorn,</HI> or <HI>Naples.</HI></P>
<P>I let her know we were Gentlemen, above &s;uch mercenary Ends; and I &s;hou'd think the Obligation &s;ufficiently paid, by &s;ending her to her Father, or Husband, which &s;he thought
<PB N="151" REF="153">
fit, when we arriv'd at <HI>Genoa.</HI> I might have known indeed, reply'd the Lady, by your Countenances and Actions, you are not of the vulgar Strain; however, I hope you'll be &s;o good to acquaint me who are my Pre&s;er|vers, that I may ever remember you in my Prayers, and wi&s;h you eternal Felicity in this World, and the next. I let her know, I wou'd take an Opportunity to &s;atisfy her, when my Brother was out of Danger. His Hurt mended every Hour, and before we ar|riv'd at <HI>Genoa,</HI> he cou'd, with the help of a Cane, walk upon Deck in calm Weather. As we &s;et out &s;ecretly from thence, we took care to be as &s;ecret in our returning back.</P>
<P>I rewarded our Men above their Expecta|tion, tho' not more than I thought they de|&s;erv'd; for it mu&s;t be own'd, our Underta|king was very hazardous, and the Succe&s;s was far beyond, even my Hopes, neither had we any one that receiv'd the lea&s;t Hurt, but my Brother. When I &s;hew'd him the Sci|mitar of the <HI>Moor</HI> I had &s;lain, he &s;oon knew it to be that of his barbarous Ma&s;ter's, as he call'd him; and the fair <HI>Fatima</HI> cou'd not hear the Death of her cruel Brother (tho' born of different Mothers) without &s;hedding Tears, which only &s;hew'd the Excellency of her Na|ture;
<PB N="152" REF="154">
for &s;ure, &s;he had Rea&s;on enough to wi&s;h his Death.</P>
<P>She told us, when &s;he heard he had &s;old my Brother to the Captain of the Cor&s;air, it gave her an infinite Satisfaction, for &s;he knew tho&s;e &s;ort of Per&s;ons under&s;tood the Value of Money &s;o well, they wou'd be ea&s;ily prevail'd upon to part with any thing, for that &s;hining Dro&s;s. I &s;ent that very Night (&s;aid <HI>Fatima,</HI> relating her Story) to the <HI>Jew,</HI> an Account of what had befell the Slave he was to redeem, with a &s;trict Charge to fini&s;h the Affair the next Day. The next Morning, as I was &s;it|ting alone, with all my Thoughts employ'd about my Love, and ca&s;ting about my E&s;cape, for I was a&s;&s;ur'd of my dear <HI>Vaughan</HI>'s Free|dom, my old Slave interrupted my Medita|tions, with the fatal News of his being car|ry'd away the Night before. The Terrors I felt, took away my Sen&s;es, and I continu'd &s;everal Hours in a Swoon. When I reviv'd, my Tears flow'd ince&s;&s;antly, and my faithful Slave, with all her Good-nature, cou'd not give me any Con&s;olation. It was two Days before I cou'd be prevail'd upon to take any Nouri&s;hment. But the <HI>Jew</HI> inform'd my old Slave, that the Cor&s;air did not intend to make more than a Four Months Voyage; therefore
<PB N="153" REF="155">
having &s;ome faint Hopes of &s;eeing my Love again, I re&s;olv'd to live till the Time was expir'd.</P>
<P>During that tedious Time, my Life was made more unea&s;y, by the barbarous Treat|ment of my Brother, who was re&s;olv'd to wed me to one of his Acquaintance, that, as he often &s;aid, he might get rid of one he ha|ted. He brought him to &s;ee me, though a|gain&s;t the Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Moors,</HI> and I had the Ill-fortune to plea&s;e him too well. I need not tell you, that Brothers, among the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI> have an ab&s;olute Command over their Si&s;ters, and the Wives of their deceas'd Father. Therefore the Day was fix'd for our Nuptials, which was to have been three Days after I had made my E&s;cape. After that barbarous Decree, my Brother gave me more Liberty than u&s;ual; therefore I had an Op|portunity of conveying a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Habit into the little Summer-Hou&s;e, where I had often convers'd with the Charmer of my Soul, the Key of which I had kept ever &s;ince the Death of my Father. By degrees, I carry'd all my Gold and Jewels there; and that very Night you came to relieve me, was the Night I had fix'd upon for my E&s;cape, (fir&s;t giving my old faithful Slave her Liberty, with a Sum
<PB N="154" REF="156">
of Money, to make her meanly happy for the re&s;t of her Life, even with my Brother's Con&s;ent.) I had but ju&s;t dre&s;s'd my&s;elf, and &s;ecur'd my little Fortune, when I was alarm'd with a confus'd Noi&s;e of People in the Gar|den, and imagining they were coming to &s;eize me, ru&s;h'd out of the Gate, and flew, as fa&s;t as my weak Limbs wou'd permit me; yet, in the Terrors of my Apprehen&s;ions, I knew not where I was going. I mu&s;t own, I was very much frighted at meeting a Stranger, yet I thought it was better than falling into the Hands of any of the People of <HI>Tunis.</HI> I &s;oon knew you were upon &s;ome clande&s;tine De&s;ign; tho' every Body &s;peaking <HI>Italian,</HI> I cou'd not under&s;tand what was &s;poke; and the Thoughts of what Fortune might attend me, gave me many terrible and unea&s;y Appre|hen&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Appearance of a wounded Per&s;on, and the Sight of a <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Lady (as I took her to be, you brought along with you) &s;oon convinc'd me you had &s;ucceeded in your De|&s;ign. I did intend to di&s;cover my&s;elf to her, hoping &s;he wou'd give me her Protection. I &s;poke to her in the <HI>Arabian</HI> Language, but was &s;urpriz'd to find I was not under&s;tood. And immediately after, perceiving the Di&s;|content
<PB N="155" REF="157">
that &s;pread it&s;elf over all your Faces, I cou'd not help endeavouring to find it out; imagining I heard <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;poke among you, doubled my Curio&s;ity. I need not tell you my Surprize, when I heard the Voice of my dear <HI>Vaughan</HI> repeat my Name, who&s;e lov'd Accents were ever in my Ears. You &s;aw the violent Working of my Soul, and brought me from Death to Life, a Life of Joy and Tran&s;port.</P>
<P>The unlook'd-for Happine&s;s of the&s;e four Lovers, made me once more think of my own uncertain Fate, and of my dear <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> who was never from my Thoughts.</P>
<P>My Uncle's Intention, at fir&s;t, was, that I &s;hou'd make the whole Tour of <HI>Italy</HI>; but the unfortunate End of my dear Father, was the Cau&s;e of his de&s;iring my immediate Re|turn, as he mention'd in my la&s;t Letter; and I can't but own, maugre my Curio&s;ity, which was very prevalent, I was pleas'd to think I &s;hou'd &s;ee my dear <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> before the tedious Time prefix'd for my Return.</P>
<P>Finding no Ve&s;&s;el ready to carry us to <HI>Mar|&s;eilles,</HI> where we had agreed to go by Sea, we embark'd for <HI>Leghorn,</HI> and the rather, that we might return the Lady we had brought
<PB N="156" REF="158">
from <HI>Tunis,</HI> &s;afe among her Friends. We embark'd on Board a <HI>Felucca,</HI> but had the Mortification to find the young Nobleman in the Ve&s;&s;el, bound for <HI>Leghorn</HI> (the Relation of my Governor's, mention'd before.) Our Unea&s;ine&s;s was the more on the Account of the Fair <HI>Eliza,</HI> who never dur&s;t appear upon Deck, notwith&s;tanding her Di&s;gui&s;e, for fear of being known by him; neither wou'd my Governor once come in his Sight. And, to add to my Misfortune, I was oblig'd to &s;hare Cabbins with him, or lie upon Deck.</P>
<P>During our &s;hort Voyage, he &s;eem'd good-natur'd, to a Degree; but was &s;o officiou&s;ly Talkative and Trouble&s;ome, he was hardly to be bore, ever plaguing me with Stories of his &s;ucce&s;sful Amours.</P>
<P>I was (&s;aid he) de&s;perately in Love with a Lady at <HI>Genoa,</HI> who, &s;u&s;pecting I had a Pa&s;|&s;ion for another Woman, whom, I mu&s;t own, I had an Affair with when fir&s;t I ar|riv'd, wou'd not let me alone before I had wrote her a Letter, to convince her of my Coolne&s;s. But not under&s;tanding the <HI>Italian</HI> Language well enough to write my &s;elf, I was oblig'd to employ a Countryman of ours to write it for me, which I tran&s;crib'd; and by the Con&s;equence that follow'd (for I
<PB N="157" REF="159">
&s;hou'd have been murder'd, if I had &s;taid any longer at <HI>Genoa</HI>) I believe I had not fair Play from my Friend, in the Tran&s;lation. I know you are a Ma&s;ter of that Language, and I &s;hou'd take it for a &s;ingular Favour, if you wou'd once more render it into <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that I may be a better Judge of my Countryman's Sincerity. I mu&s;t own, I took it from him to tran&s;late, that I might be rid of his Com|pany for &s;ome time. The Contents of this fine Letter were as follows:

And as I intend to vi&s;it the mo&s;t cele|brated Cities of <HI>Europe,</HI> I de&s;ign to have a Mi&s;tre&s;s at every Place I come to, if it he only to learn the Difference of the various Race of Females.

<P>The Sen&s;e of this Letter, gave me a more de&s;picable Opinion of the Fool that wrote it; and I mu&s;t own, the Trouble I was forc'd to endure, in having his impertinent Company, gave me very much Unea&s;ine&s;s; for, during our Voyage, I was oblig'd to appear as a Stranger to my Brother, my Governor, and the Ladies, for fear he &s;hou'd come to know 'em. But our Arrival at <HI>Leghorn,</HI> after a Voyage of Five Days, gave me &s;ome Re|po&s;e; for as &s;oon as he landed, he took a Po&s;t-Chai&s;e for <HI>Florence,</HI> and rid us of his mo&s;t trouble&s;ome Company: Tho' he re|turn'd
<PB N="159" REF="161">
in a Week, and went back in the &s;ame Ve&s;&s;el for <HI>Genoa</HI> again. I mu&s;t own, Fo|reigners may ju&s;tly have a Contempt for our Nation, when too many that travel, have the &s;ame Sentiments with this young Imperti|nent.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we landed, we conducted the Lady to her Father's Hou&s;e, where we found the whole Family in Mourning. We did not immediately di&s;cover her to him, but pre|tended our Bu&s;ine&s;s with him, was only to re|commend us to a Hou&s;e, where we might re|&s;ide, during our Stay in <HI>Leghorn.</HI> He told us, if we cou'd be contented with a melan|choly Family, we might make u&s;e of his Hou&s;e, as if it were our own. We thank'd him for the Favour, and, by degrees, got out of him the Rea&s;on of his Mourning. My Brother, being a Man of &s;ome Mirth, told him, he believ'd, by the Art of Divination, he cou'd, in le&s;s than Five Minutes, inform him whether he &s;hou'd ever &s;ee his Daughter again, and the Day and the Hour of their Meeting: But the Merchant expre&s;s'd &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s, as imagining my Brother made a Je&s;t of his Sorrows: Nay, Sir (&s;aid my Go|vernor) don't look grave at what the Gentle|man propo&s;es to you, for I can a&s;&s;ure you he
<PB N="160" REF="162">
has an admirable Knowledge that way. What my Governor &s;aid, &s;eem'd only to add to his Confu&s;ion. Pray, Sir, &s;aid I, tell me one Thing, is your Son-in-law here, or at <HI>Na|ples?</HI> Gentlemen (return'd our kind Ho&s;t) I mu&s;t own, you look like &s;uch, pray don't laugh at the Misfortunes of a mourning Fa|mily, who&s;e Di&s;tre&s;s is never to be forgot; my unfortunate Son-in-law is now in the Hou&s;e with me, but &s;uch a Picture of Un|happine&s;s, that cannot be look'd on without Compa&s;&s;ion; and I fear his Death, in a very &s;hort time, will add to our Mourning. I be|gan to think, the unexpected Sight of the La|dy might be as prejudicial as their Sorrow; therefore told him, in a few Words, by de|grees, the Adventure of the Lady, and fetch'd her out of a Room where &s;he was conceal'd, and had heard all, to throw her&s;elf at his Feet. When &s;he appear'd, he &s;tood fix'd in A&s;toni&s;hment for &s;ome time; but when he was convinc'd it was his Daughter that knelt before him, the Tears of Joy gu&s;h'd out &s;o fa&s;t, that &s;topt the Utterance of his Tongue. When his extravagant Tran&s;port was a little abated, he went up to his Son-in-law, and after &s;taying &s;ome time, brought him down with him; he appear'd the very Shadow of a Hu|man

Form; and notwith&s;tanding he had been prepar'd for the tender Interview, as &s;oon as he enter'd the Room, he &s;unk, &s;peechle&s;s, in|to his Father-in-law's Arms. We thought it proper to retire into another Apartment, during this dumb Scene. It was &s;ome time before they came to us, but the Redundancy of their Gratitude had almo&s;t overwhelm'd us.

<P>When we came back to <HI>Leghorn,</HI> in order to prepare for our Journey, a violent Fever attack'd me, that confin'd me to my Apart|ment for near two Months, which I can at|tribute to nothing more, than the Anxiety of my Mind; and as mo&s;t Fevers are attended with Deliriums, I was for ever crying out of the Infidelity of my dear <HI>I&s;abella</HI>; even when my Illne&s;s was gone, the Lowne&s;s of my Spi|rits gave Force to my Imagination, and tho&s;e unea&s;y Thoughts retarded my Strength.</P>
<P>One Day, taking the Air upon the Water, the Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Felucca</HI> that brought us from <HI>Genoa,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing by in a Boat, told me, he believ'd I had left a Packet of Letters in my Cabbin, which he wou'd bring me, if I wou'd give him a Direction.

de&s;ired he would &s;end 'em where I lodg'd the next Day. When he brought 'em, they were &s;eal'd up.

Af|ter Dinner, we went to my Apartment, and
<PB N="165" REF="167">
taking out the Packet, I gave it my Brother to read. The fir&s;t was as follows:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with infinite Joy I am inform'd of your Health; and, to communicate &s;ome of that Plea&s;ure to you, I mu&s;t acquaint you, my Father is gone to vi&s;it the Re&s;idence of his Ance&s;tors; that is, in plain <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> I have bury'd him &s;umptuou&s;ly. His Death, you know, has made me Ma&s;ter of <HI>12000 l.</HI> a Year, and the Li|berty of pur&s;uing my Plea&s;ures without Re&s;traint. But I think it's a great Pity the <HI>Japan</HI> Law, concerning Children, is not of Force in <HI>Eng|land</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a Law in the Empire of <HI>Japan,</HI> or a Cu|&s;tom as &s;trong as a Law, That all Fathers of any No|bility, re&s;ign their E&s;tates to their elde&s;t Sons, when they have reach'd their Twentieth Year, or Five and Twenty at the farthe&s;t. The Fathers generally retire to &s;ome Ca&s;tle, and &s;pend the Remnant of their Lives in contemplating the Vanities of this World; but are al|ways ready to give their Sons proper Advice in their Worldly Affairs, if the Son thinks fit to ask it. Some Fathers retire among the <HI>Bonzies</HI> (or Prie&s;ts) and never enter into Conver&s;ation with any of the World, de&s;pi&s;ing the Pomp and Sple<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4 letters"> of it, ending their Days in mor|tifying their Fle&s;h.</NOTE>. The old Put of a Pere, for&s;ooth! in his Life-time, talk'd to me of Virtue, Morali|ty;
<PB N="166" REF="168">
and I know not what Stuff. Dinning ever in my Ears, that Nobility, without Virtue, was like an eminent barren Mountain, &s;een, and &s;lighted.</P>
<P>I have, once more, made my Addre&s;&s;es to <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> with all the glaring Equipage of No|bility and Fortune, but &s;he's as cold as a Cucum|ber. But I have found out the Rea&s;on of that Coldne&s;s. It &s;eems &s;he's damnably in Love with that young learned Blockhead, <HI>Vaughan.</HI> I'll tell you how I came by that Knowledge. In one of my Vi&s;its at her Mother's Hou&s;e, I was told the young Lady had been &s;ome time in the Gar|den; I made no Scruple of following her. But, you mu&s;t think, I was &s;omething &s;urpriz'd to find her a&s;leep in a retir'd Arbor, with a Letter in her Hand, from that wretched Coxcomb you and I have &s;o often laugh'd at, who &s;hou'd have been well whip'd by me for his Impudence, be|fore he went from <HI>England,</HI> but that I thought it was beneath me to cha&s;ti&s;e a School-Boy.</P>
<P>I took away the Letter, without any manner of Ceremony, and &s;hew'd it to her Mother and Aunt; but was very much &s;urpriz'd, to find they had no Re&s;entment again&s;t <HI>Vaughan,</HI> nor the Girl, for &s;uch a Di&s;covery; tho' I found it was new to them. They both coolty told me,
<PB N="167" REF="169">
<HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s Inclinations &s;hou'd never be forc'd; yet if I cou'd gain her Con&s;ent, theirs would &s;oon follow. In &s;hort, there's nothing to be done with the young Girl; and I own, I think I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ou'd like her, even for a Year or two. Now I have learnt, by Piecemeal, that <HI>Vaughan</HI> in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ends to travel the Way you de&s;ign. If you meet with him, which is very likely, can't you recommend him to &s;ome <HI>Italian</HI> Man of Bu&s;i|ne&s;s? Or rather, find &s;ome Method, by Let|ter, to make <HI>I&s;abella</HI> believe, he has got him a Mi&s;tre&s;s in his Travels. Ay, that will do, in my Opinion, better. Then her Re&s;entment may bring her to my Arms; for, upon &s;econd Thoughts, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t is not quite generous to take away his Life, &s;ince, now I remember, he once was in &s;ome Danger in &s;aving mine. Be&s;ides, if I could accompli&s;h my Affair with <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> I don't know but he might be Fool enough, to hang him|&s;elf, and then my Revenge will be compleat. If you can think of &s;ome Way, you will very much oblige me. I &s;hall find no Difficulty in deceiving <HI>I&s;abella.</HI> However, the &s;ooner the better, for, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n &s;hort, if I can't find &s;ome Method &s;peedily, I mu&s;t ev'en ravi&s;h her, I think, and make an End of the Bu&s;ine&s;s that way.

if he convers'd longer with the Lady you wot of in <HI>German-Street,</HI> without con&s;ulting a Sur|geon; but he &s;lighted my Advice, and therefore he has an&s;wer'd that Folly with his Life.

</LETTER></P>
<P>The Reading of this Letter, gave me the mo&s;t horrid Apprehen&s;ions my Soul ever knew. I call'd to mind the Letter I tran&s;la|ted from the <HI>Italian,</HI> at the De&s;ire of that Wretch, not doubting, in the lea&s;t, but that was the Engine, made to de&s;troy all my Peace. In the fir&s;t Tran&s;ports of my Fury, I &s;aid, and did the mo&s;t extravagant things imaginable, to the Surprize of all the Com|pany.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Letter was directed to <HI>Paris,</HI> and the &s;econd to <HI>Genoa.</HI> My Brother ca&s;ting his Eyes cur&s;orily over the &s;econd, I perceiv'd his Colour change, &s;eeming very unwilling to read it. I &s;natch'd it out of his Hands, and, to my Surprize and Terror, found I was utterly de&s;troy'd.</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="169" REF="171">
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> Receiv'd your la&s;t Packet with more Tran&s;|ports, than I ever felt from the &s;weet con|&s;enting Embraces of a Mi&s;tre&s;s. I think your Policy in over-reaching that contemptible Cox|comb, <HI>Vaughan,</HI> exceeds even <HI>Machiavel,</HI> for Cunning; and I don't doubt but breathing the &s;ame Air, and being in the &s;ame Climate where that Prince of Politicians was born, in&s;pir'd you. But I mu&s;t tell you, how Fortune a&s;&s;i&s;ted me in carrying on the Deceit.</P>
<P>You know the Letter <HI>Vaughan</HI> tran&s;lated, by your In&s;tigation, was not &s;eal'd. I, by good For|tune, was at <HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s Mother's, where I met the Uncle of <HI>Vaughan:</HI> I took an Occa&s;ion to bor|row his Seal, and with it &s;eal'd that Letter in|tended for <HI>I&s;abella;</HI> their Arms being the &s;ame, you may be a&s;&s;ur'd, it help'd my De&s;ign.</P>
<P>Two Days after this, I got tru&s;ty <HI>Roger,</HI> my cunning Dog of a Footman, to put on a Sailor's Dre&s;s, and deliver the Letter to <HI>I&s;abel|la,</HI> when I was pre&s;ent. I had order'd him to tell her, he receiv'd that Letter, with many others, from &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentlemen at <HI>Ge|noa.</HI> The young Lady blu&s;h'd, and trembled, when &s;he receiv'd it, viewing the Seal very circum&s;pectly; but the Hand of the Direction
<PB N="170" REF="172">
not being the &s;ame that was expected from the Seal, &s;he &s;eem'd to be in the utmo&s;t Con&s;ternation: However, there was no one to make Ob&s;ervations upon her Looks, but my&s;elf, her Mother and Aunt being gone, &s;ome Moments before <HI>Roger</HI> came with the Letter, to dre&s;s them&s;elves, in order to make a Vi&s;it, and <HI>I&s;abella</HI> was to go along with them. The young Lady went into the Garden, in order to read the dear Epi&s;tle with more Freedom, and &s;taid &s;o long there, that the Mother, with the Aunt, came down dre&s;t, order'd the Coach to the Door, and in|quir'd after her. I told 'em, a Sailor had brought the young Lady a Letter from <HI>Genoa,</HI> from one, I &s;uppos'd, &s;he was very glad to hear from, for &s;he chang'd Countenance &s;everal times, then went to the Garden to enjoy the Contents a|lone. The Mother and Aunt &s;eem'd very much di&s;turb'd at my &s;hort Story, and follow'd <HI>I&s;a|bella</HI> into the Garden, without giving me one Word in return. Some Moments after, I was a little &s;urpriz'd, I own, to &s;ee the Aunt re|turn in great Ha&s;te, calling to the Servants for Water. The Hou&s;e was all in an Uproar, and I &s;oon under&s;tood <HI>I&s;abella</HI> was in a fainting Fit. This gave me &s;ome little Unea&s;ine&s;s, to think &s;he lov'd another &s;o well; yet I bury'd it &s;oon, knowing violent Pa&s;&s;ions never la&s;t long.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="173"><HI>I&s;abella</HI> was brought in by the Servants, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Appearance, void of Life, with the Mother and Aunt weeping over her. They put her to Bed; but as fa&s;t as &s;he recover'd out of one fainting Fit, &s;he fell into another. In &s;hort, the Family was in &s;o much Di&s;traction, for &s;everal Hours, that I thought it proper to retire without Ceremony, feeding on the Hopes this Di&s;turbance would produce.</P>
<P>I &s;ent, the next Morning, to inquire of <HI>I&s;a|bella</HI>'s Health, and was inform'd, &s;he was in a violent Fever. The Me&s;&s;enger brought me a Note from the Aunt, that told me, <HI>her Niece was often troubled with a bad Dige|&s;tion, and tho&s;e fainting Fits were too com|mon with her, yet that was the wor&s;t &s;he ever had,</HI> &amp;c. I own, my dear <HI>Ned,</HI> I cou'd not help &s;miling at the Note; but however, I found by it, they intended the true Rea&s;on &s;hould be a Secret, and, you know, it was my Intere&s;t, not to divulge it.</P>
<P>In about ten Days after this Affair, I ven|tur'd to make 'em another Vi&s;it, where I found <HI>I&s;abella</HI> &s;o much alter'd, that, in reality, I pi|ty'd her. She look'd as if &s;he was going to her Grave; but, notwith&s;tanding her Palene&s;s, her Charms were as powerful as ever; and I own, I love her more and more, every time I &s;ee her.
<PB N="172" REF="174">
One thing gave me infinite Plea&s;ure at this Vi|&s;it; I ob&s;erv'd her Looks were not &s;o full of Scorn, when &s;he ca&s;t her Eyes upon me. I did not mention my Pa&s;&s;ion for &s;everal Days; but the Re&s;pect I treated her with, and the Tender|ne&s;s I expre&s;s'd for her melancholy Indi&s;po&s;ition, &s;eem'd grateful to all the Family.</P>
<P>When I once more mention'd my Love, <HI>I&s;a|bella</HI> only &s;igh'd, and &s;hed Tears, but did not rally me, as &s;he was wont to do. In &s;hort, I follow'd my Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o clo&s;e, that the whole Family gave me their Con&s;ent, and <HI>I&s;abella</HI> now treats me as her future Husband. She has freely declar'd to me, the Pa&s;&s;ion &s;he once had for <HI>Vaughan;</HI> and only begs our Nuptials may be delay'd, till &s;he can wholly give me that Heart, the other &s;o little de&s;erv'd. This Decla|ration is no Secret, tho' the Cau&s;e is not known out of the Family. <HI>Vaughan</HI>'s Uncle has been very much bu&s;y'd about &s;ome Concerns of his Brother's Family, who is lately dead, together with his Wife, and a Son of hers. And it is whi&s;per'd in the Neighbourhood, as if &s;ome poi|&s;oning Work had been done in the Family by the Wife, tho' &s;he has &s;uffer'd her&s;elf. I only wi&s;h the Knowledge of it, when it reaches your raw Traveller, may prove a <HI>Mittimus</HI> to convey him into another World, for fear our Plot

&s;hould be di&s;cover'd. However, when I have wedded <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> I &s;hall take care to put Bounds to her Liberty, I mean, if my Love &s;hould con|tinue after Wedlock, which I begin to think no impo&s;&s;ible thing.</P>
<P><HI>Vaughan</HI>'s Uncle, this Morning, came to pay his Re&s;pects to the Family, as u&s;ual; but the Mother, the Aunt, and <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> order'd the Servants to &s;ay they were abroad. The old Gentleman return'd home, &s;omething chagrin'd. I &s;uppo&s;e his Vi&s;its there, for the future, will be thought only a Trouble to the Family. My dear <HI>Ned,</HI> I &s;han't write to you any more, till our Nuptials are over, which I hope will be in two Months at the farthe&s;t. However, let me know where you intend to be, that I may be &s;ure where my Epi&s;tle may find you.

<P><HI>Eliza,</HI> in our fir&s;t Day's Journey, was ta|ken with a &s;udden Indi&s;po&s;ition, that prevent|ed our going any further that Day. We were far from any Town, and it was with great Difficulty we found Accommodation at a lit|tle Village, a Mile from the main Road. I was agitated with &s;o much impatient Pa&s;&s;ion, that my Friends found it a hard Task to per|&s;uade me from leaving them behind, and pur|&s;uing my Journey with my two Servants. The next Morning, <HI>Eliza</HI> was much better; but, to my great Mortification, I was &s;o weak, that I had not Strength enough to ri&s;e without Help; yet, notwith&s;tanding my Condition, I order'd my Litter to be got
<PB N="175" REF="177">
ready, but was inform'd, the Men went a|way with it back to <HI>Leghorn,</HI> early in the Morning. I lo&s;t all Patience at the Di&s;ap|pointment, and fell out with my Friends; not doubting (tho' they deny'd it) but it was their Contrivance, to prevent my Journey during my Weakne&s;s. In &s;hort, my Illne&s;s redoubled its Attacks, and took &s;uch &s;trong Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Outworks, that it was the Opinion of every one about me, my Life could not hold out much longer. My Sen&s;es left me, and a &s;trong Di&s;traction &s;eiz'd my Soul. But even in tho&s;e Fits of Madne&s;s, Revenge was uppermo&s;t; for they inform'd me, when I came out of tho&s;e Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, all my Ravings were upon <HI>I&s;abella</HI> and my Rival, threatning Death to Both.</P>
<P>The Place where we were, had but little Accommodation for us, even in Health, and much le&s;s for a Per&s;on in my Condition; therefore my Brother, unknown to me, ap|ply'd him&s;elf to a neighbouring Gentleman, who freely granted us the U&s;e of his Hou&s;e. I was remov'd there; and having the Ad|vice of the be&s;t Phy&s;icians from <HI>Florence,</HI> my Di&s;temper, by degrees, left me; but I &s;till continu'd in &s;uch a weak Condition, it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to remove, &s;o &s;oon as my
<PB N="176" REF="178">
Impatience wou'd have me. I was well a&s;|&s;ur'd, the Time affix'd for the fatal Nuptials was elaps'd, therefore my Heart began to feel &s;ome Ea&s;e in the Re&s;olution I had taken in the Revenging the Lo&s;s of my Love, by the Death of my hated Rival, or falling a Victim to my Misfortunes. This Hope gave me room to gather &s;ome Strength, which in a few Days increas'd &s;o much, that I cou'd walk in the Garden, which was one of tho&s;e noble ones in <HI>Italy,</HI> that &s;urpa&s;s even many Princes in other Countries. But what was my Surprize! when, in a neighbouring Arbor, I heard the Voice of that Wretch, &s;inging an <HI>Italian</HI> Air, who by his damnable Wiles, had prevail'd upon me to tran&s;late that Letter, which was the &s;ole Cau&s;e of all my Misfortunes. My Fury gave me Strength enough to fly to the Place from whence I heard his dete&s;ted Voice. As &s;oon as I came near him, I could not help crying out, with the utmo&s;t Tran&s;port of Fury, Villain! thy la&s;t Moment is approaching! I never once con&s;ider'd I had no other Weapon than a Cane, to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in walking, which I thru&s;t again&s;t his Brea&s;t with &s;uch Violence, that he fell backwards in a mighty Fright. How|ever, finding it was no offen&s;ive Weapon I
<PB N="177" REF="179">
had in my Hand, he drew his Sword, and made &s;everal Thru&s;ts at me, which I parry'd with my Cane for &s;ome time; and at la&s;t, with much Difficulty, di&s;arm'd him. But the Violence of the Exerci&s;e being too &s;trong for my weak Condition, I fell to the Ground almo&s;t Sen&s;ele&s;s. The Wretch &s;eeing that, recover'd his Sword, and, with all his Strength, &s;tabb'd me thro' the Shoulder; the Sword enter'd &s;o far into the Earth, that he made &s;everal fruitle&s;s Attempts to pull it out again. I had ju&s;t Sen&s;e enough to know what he was doing, without any Power to prevent him. But my Brother <HI>Jonathan</HI> com|ing upon the In&s;tant, put an end to his vain Efforts, by laying him breathle&s;s at my Feet, with a Blow of his Sword. He then came to my A&s;&s;i&s;tance, leaving the Wretch wel|tring in his Blood. The Family, and my Friends, were &s;oon alarm'd; tho 'no one cou'd come to the true Knowledge of this Quarrel for the pre&s;ent; but the Appearances &s;eem'd &s;trong again&s;t the other, becau&s;e I had no Sword. However, the Gentleman of the Hou&s;e took care of him, as having &s;ome &s;mall Acquaintance with him. He inform'd us, that the villainous Wretch waited for a Servant that he had &s;ent to <HI>Leghorn</HI> for a
<PB N="178" REF="180">
Packet of Letters, which I too well knew were tho&s;e the Captain deliver'd to me. When my Wound was dre&s;t, I inform'd the Gentle|man of all that befell me. When he heard his barbarous Policy to undo my Peace, he exclaim'd again&s;t his Conduct, vowing never to give him any Countenance for the fu|ture.</P>
<P>My Wound was not dangerous, tho' the Lo&s;s of Blood contributed to my Weakne&s;s; but the Wretch that gave it me, &s;eem'd in a very dangerous Condition; for the Blow my Brother gave him, had fractur'd his Skull, and the Violence of the Pain often took away his Sen&s;es. Yet, in his Intervals, he talk'd of nothing but Revenge, declaring to every one that came to vi&s;it him, my Brother's Blood &s;hould make Atonement for the Tor|ment he &s;uffer'd. As for my&s;elf, he had &s;uf|ficiently puni&s;h'd me, in being the In&s;trument of robbing me of all that cou'd make me hap|py in this World. I mu&s;t own, I was in &s;ome Fear for my Brother; therefore was for leaving the Place as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. But the <HI>Italian</HI> Gentleman, in who&s;e Hou&s;e we were, advis'd us not to pur&s;ue our Journey by Land. He laid before me the many Difficulties we &s;hou'd meet with, and convinc'd me we
<PB N="179" REF="181">
&s;hou'd make our Voyage &s;ooner, by imbark|ing for <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> and travelling thro <HI>France</HI> by Land. The <HI>Alps,</HI> at this Time of the Year, he a&s;&s;ur'd us, were cover'd with Snow, and many had peri&s;h'd by mi&s;taking the Road. The Con&s;ideration of the two Ladies, pre|vail'd upon me more than any Danger I fear'd; therefore we were determin'd, as &s;oon as po&s;|&s;ible, to return to <HI>Leghorn,</HI> and procure a Ve&s;|&s;el to carry us to <HI>Mar&s;eilles.</HI></P>
<P>My Wound was &s;o well heal'd in &s;ix Days after I receiv'd it, that the &s;eventh, I re&s;olv'd with my Companions to venture on Hor&s;e|back, in order to return to <HI>Leghorn.</HI> But when the Time came, my Brother was not to be found. We made all the Enquiry imagi|nable to no purpo&s;e; but what gave me &s;ome &s;mall Satisfaction, was, that <HI>Fatima</HI> a&s;&s;ur'd me he was gone to <HI>Leghorn,</HI> to provide a Ve&s;|&s;el for our Voyage. I own, I much won|der'd he had not inform'd us of his De&s;ign; but as the fair <HI>Fatima</HI> &s;eem'd very ea&s;y, I thought I had no Rea&s;on to be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>We took Leave of our friendly <HI>Italian</HI>; tho', I mu&s;t own, I parted with &s;ome Re|gret from that infamous Wretch, who was the Cau&s;e of all my Sorrows, without giving him the Puni&s;hment due to his Crimes. How|ever,
<PB N="180" REF="182">
I did not doubt but the Ju&s;tiee of Hea|ven would overtake him; and I found &s;ome Con&s;olation in overcoming my ju&s;t Re&s;ent|ment.</P>
<P>We pur&s;u'd our Journey for <HI>Leghorn,</HI> where we arriv'd the next Day, without any Accident; but, upon Enquiry after my Bro|ther, we cou'd learn no News of him. I began then to be very unea&s;y; and ob&s;erv'd a Gloom on <HI>Fatima</HI>'s Countenance, notwith|&s;tanding all her Endeavours to conceal it. Se|veral Days pa&s;t in this Uncertainty, till <HI>Fati|ma</HI>'s Fears began to be too powerful for her Prudence; yet all my Per&s;ua&s;ions cou'd not get the Rea&s;on of my Brother's Ab&s;ence from her, tho' &s;he confe&s;s'd to me, &s;he knew it. My Governor, <HI>Eliza,</HI> and I, had many Con|jectures, but none could give us any Con&s;ola|tion, e&s;pecially &s;ince we ob&s;erv'd <HI>Fatima</HI> be|gan to be incon&s;olable, and confe&s;s'd, his Stay was beyond the Time prefix'd. We pre&s;s'd her on all &s;ides, to declare to us the Rea&s;on of his unexpected Ab&s;ence, with this Per&s;ua&s;ion, that it was po&s;&s;ible the Knowledge of it might be of Service to him; but all our Intreaties prov'd ineffectual: Yet &s;he de|clar'd, if we had no Tidings of him in two Day, &s;he wou'd confe&s;s to us the Secret.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="183">We went to Bed, full of Terrors, and for my own Part, Sleep was a Stranger to me. But, in the middle of the Night, I was a|larm'd with a violent Knocking at the Gate; the Servants of the Hou&s;e not ri&s;ing at the &s;econd Alarm, I &s;lipt on my Gown, and with my Sword in my Hand, went down in|to the Court-Yard; but gue&s;s my Surprize, when, asking, <HI>Who was there?</HI> I heard my Brother's Voice. I open'd the Gate, and my Surprize was doubled, when I found my Brother on Hor&s;eback, at the Head of a Lit|ter, with a &s;ick Man in it, attended by four Servants: But, when I found the Per&s;on within it, was the Wretch that had wounded me in the Garden of the <HI>Italian</HI> Gentleman, my Wonder ty'd up my Tongue, and my Company (who by this time were come to us) &s;tood like &s;o many Statues &s;truck with the Sight of <HI>Medu&s;a</HI>'s Head. At la&s;t, ob&s;erving my Brother's Diligence in helping him out of the Litter, in a &s;eeming Trance, we all, in|voluntarily, gave him our A&s;&s;i&s;tance, with|out knowing what we were doing. We put him into Bed, and then follow'd my Brother out of the Room (leaving his Servants and a Surgeon with him, that came in their Com|pany)
<PB N="182" REF="184">
without &s;peaking a Word, &s;o full of Wonder, that our Tongues &s;eem'd of no U&s;e to us.</P>
<P>When we came down into the Hall, my Brother tenderly embrac'd us all; tho' his dear <HI>Fatima</HI> could not &s;peak, yet the Tears of Joy that fell from her fair Eyes, convinc'd us all of the tender Love &s;he bore him. When we were &s;eated &s;ome time, gazing &s;i|lently at one another, my Brother began his Story as follows.</P>
<P>My dear Brother, I mu&s;t fir&s;t beg your Pardon for concealing from you what I am going to relate; but my Rea&s;on for it was, that you wou'd not have given your Con&s;ent to what I de&s;ign'd to do. Two Days before we intended to leave our friendly <HI>Italian,</HI> I receiv'd that Letter, (which he gave me to read,)
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>To JONATHAN VAUGHAN, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU may, perhaps, imagine, I &s;hall forget the Injury I &s;uffer'd from you. But be a&s;|&s;ur'd, the Moment I have Strength enough to draw a Sword, I &s;hall expect Satisfaction for your cowardly Treatment. In a Day or two
<PB N="183" REF="185">
more, I &s;hall be able to puni&s;h you for the Wound you gave me, if that Per&s;on can have Courage enough to look a Man in the Face, who would &s;tab him behind his Back. The Gentle|man of the Hou&s;e, my Friend, being impos'd upon by your fal&s;e Legend, has withdrawn his Kindne&s;s from me; but I hope, by your Puni&s;h|ment, to let him &s;ee how you have &s;lander'd ba&s;e|ly, one that cannot forget the Injury, without wa&s;hing off your Crime with your Blood. All I fear is, that this Notice will make you fly from my ju&s;t Re&s;entment; but no Place on Earth &s;hall hide you from my Cha&s;ti&s;ement. My Rage &s;hou'd correct your Brother for his Ill-manners, in reading tho&s;e Letters, you were all well a&s;&s;ur'd belong'd to me. But I know his Curio&s;ity carry'd his Puni&s;hment along with it. Yet when I have, with my Sword, let out your Treachery and Ba&s;ene&s;s, I may think it worth my while to &s;courge him for that Folly, that can have no other Excu&s;e than the childi&s;h Curio&s;ity of a Boy, who left his School before he had been well whipp'd for his Impertinence.</P>

</LETTER></P>
<P>This Letter was given me (continu'd my Brother) by a Servant, who told me he was order'd by his Ma&s;ter, to wait the next Morn|ing in the &s;ame Place, for an An&s;wer. The Letter, I own, gave me much Concern. I advis'd with my dear <HI>Fatima,</HI> and with much Difficulty, got her Con&s;ent to &s;end an An|&s;wer, in which I promis'd to meet him at the Time and Place appointed. I a&s;&s;ur'd <HI>Fatima</HI> I would be with you in eight Days, at the farthe&s;t; and for that time, &s;he gave me her Word to keep the Affair a Secret from every one. The Morning I parted from her, was with the utmo&s;t Sorrow. She took her Leave of me, as if &s;he was never to &s;ee me more. I retir'd, with my Servant, full of Grief, to the little Cottage upon the Skirts of the Mead,
<PB N="185" REF="187">
where I gave my&s;elf up to examine my Con|&s;cience, and endeavour'd to make my Peace with Heaven; tho' I own to you, I thought I was going to do a Deed, not in the lea&s;t ac|ceptable to God. As &s;oon as the appointed Morning came, I aro&s;e, giving my Servant Orders to ob&s;erve the Combat; and if it was my Fate to fall, he &s;hou'd immediately repair to you (after laying me in the Earth) and give you an Account of my End.</P>
<P>About Six o' Clock, I perceiv'd my An|tagoni&s;t, coming &s;low and pen&s;ive along the Skirts of the Meadow. When he came near|er to me, I ob&s;erv'd he had been weeping. Tears, &s;aid I, can make but poor Atonement for the many Injuries thou ha&s;t heap'd upon my poor Brother and Me; therefore, betake thee to thy Sword, that I may cha&s;ti&s;e thy Perfidy. He made me no An&s;wer, but draw|ing his Sword, I made a full Pa&s;s at him, which he, opening his Arms, receiv'd into his Brea&s;t, and fell towards me, upon his Face, with the Point of my Sword out at his Back. I was very much &s;urpriz'd at his man|ner of Proceeding; and calling my Servant, who waited at &s;ome Di&s;tance, we both rais'd him up. Forbear, &s;aid he, and think not of giving A&s;&s;i&s;tance to a Wretch, that rather de|&s;erves
<PB N="186" REF="188">
Death from your Hands, and who came on purpo&s;e to be puni&s;h'd for all tho&s;e Crimes, the Heat of Youth, and want of Thought, have made me commit. I had no other way to recompen&s;e all tho&s;e Ills I have done your worthy Brother, but to receive Death from your Hands. The Wound you formerly gave me, prob'd me to the Soul; my Illne&s;s gave me Lei&s;ure to think, and Thought was my Monitor. I knew what I had done, in&s;tigated by One, who&s;e Nobility is a Stain to Virtue, was the ba&s;e&s;t Act I could have committed. I had no other Method to meet with the Death I de&s;ired, but by writing that Letter to you. I had not the A&s;&s;urance to look your injur'd Brother in the Face. But I beg, by Honour, Virtue, and all the amia|ble Train of Goodne&s;s, to plead for me to your noble Brother, who&s;e Virtues rank him above Nobility. I con&s;ider'd my Crime no more than a little Artifice, which would be approv'd by all the laughing Part of the World. But when I weigh'd it fully in my Illne&s;s, I found it the ba&s;e&s;t, blacke&s;t, and mo&s;t inhuman Policy, that ever was com|mitted by mortal Man. I often us'd to whi&s;per to my&s;elf, What Anxiety have I felt, even for a Di&s;appointment of a Day! But
<PB N="187" REF="189">
what mu&s;t the&s;e two poor, virtuous, inno|cent, abus'd Souls &s;uffer, even to the Sepa|ration of their Mortality! My Wound was never &s;o dangerous as reported. But the Tor|ments of my troubled Con&s;cience, per&s;uaded even the Surgeon, that I was often delirious, when alas! all my Madne&s;s was in my Mind, and not in the Brain. I purpo&s;ely, when I was calm, threaten'd Revenge upon you; but it was only that you might be inform'd of my fal&s;e Re&s;entment again&s;t you, I well know|ing, your Spirit would find &s;ome Means to &s;eek me out, and puni&s;h me for my Crime as I de&s;erv'd. Even the Letter I wrote to you, went to my Soul, becau&s;e what I wrote was again&s;t my Con&s;cience. All I de&s;ire of you, is, to bury me ob&s;curely, and let my Faults be forgotten in the Grave. He endeavour'd to &s;ay more, but his Tongue falter'd, his Eyes clos'd, and, grafping me faintly by the Hand, he &s;unk to the Earth, in all Appear|ance never to ri&s;e again. We took him in our Arms, and, with the Sword in his Brea&s;t, carry'd him to the Cottage, and then &s;ent my Servant for the Surgeon, that attended you both in your Illne&s;s. While he was gone, there &s;eem'd no &s;ign of Life in him. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, his unhappy Condition had wip'd a|way
<PB N="188" REF="190">
all Re&s;entment in me, and I felt for him all the Tenderne&s;s of a Brother and Friend, wa&s;hing his Face with my repentant Tears, often cur&s;ing my&s;elf for the ra&s;h Act.</P>
<P>When the Surgeon came, he drew the Sword out of his Body, upon which he open'd his Eyes, fetching a deep Sigh, but clos'd 'em immediately again. However, the Surgeon prob'd his Wound, and gave me &s;ome Hopes it might not prove mortal. We undre&s;s'd him, and put him to Bed; but the Surgeon de&s;ir'd we might leave the Room, till the Evening he came again; for he confidently a&s;&s;ur'd us, by that Time, he would either be pa&s;t Cure, or out of Danger. I own I cou'd not obey his Orders, but &s;at by his Bed&s;ide till the Evening the Surgeon return'd; and all that time, I cou'd not perceive him to breathe; therefore, I was a&s;&s;ur'd in my&s;elf, the Soul had taken her Flight for ever. The Surgeon, by his Countenance, &s;eem'd to think as I did; but when he took off his Plai&s;ters from his Wounds, he cry'd, Courage! Sir; we have Hopes, and great ones too. I own, tho&s;e Words very much chear'd my drooping Spi|rits. When he had once more dre&s;s'd him, he forc'd open his Mouth, and pour'd in &s;ome Cordial, which upon the In&s;tant caus'd him
<PB N="189" REF="191">
to groan, and &s;ome Moments after he open'd his Eyes, faintly looking upon us, but did not &s;eem to know us. In &s;hort, it was four Days ere he came to his Sen&s;es; and then the Surgeon declar'd he was out of Danger, &s;ince in that time he had e&s;cap'd a Fever.</P>
<P>I was &s;o much concern'd for his Welfare, that I had even forgot the Time I propos'd to meet you at <HI>Leghorn,</HI> was elaps'd; therefore I &s;ent my Servant to acquaint you with the Rea&s;on of my Delay, intending to follow the next Day. But we were very much &s;urpriz'd la&s;t Night, to find the poor Fellow ty'd to a Tree in the Road, having been robb'd of his Hor&s;e, his Cloaths and Money, as al&s;o &s;e|verely beaten into the Bargain.</P>
<P>Tho' the Gentleman's Wounds were almo&s;t heal'd, yet he continu'd &s;o weak, that he could not get out of his Bed without A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance; yet, knowing the Nece&s;&s;ity of my be|ing with you, he would accompany me in the Litter that carry'd you a Day's Journey into the Country (that I had order'd to be con|ceal'd in the Village, to prevent, my dear Brother, your pur&s;uing a ra&s;h De&s;ign, that mu&s;t have ended with your Life, con&s;idering the Weakne&s;s of your Condition.) I'll wait on you, &s;aid he, to your worthy Brother, to
<PB N="190" REF="192">
obtain his Pardon, or die at his Feet. When he was inform'd we were near the Hou&s;e where you re&s;ided, the Thoughts of &s;eeing the Face of the Per&s;on he had &s;o heinou&s;ly injur'd, took away his Sen&s;es, and he faint|ed away. But the Surgeon a&s;&s;ur'd us, a lit|tle Re&s;t and Quietne&s;s would &s;oon re&s;tore him; therefore de&s;ired he might not be di|&s;turb'd for &s;ome Hours.</P>
<P>When my Brother had ended his Relation, Revenge, Hate, Fury, with all the Train of violent Pa&s;&s;ions, left my Brea&s;t; and in their room, &s;oft Compa&s;&s;ion, Tenderne&s;s, with Friend&s;hip, took their Place. Tho' I was undone thro' his Means, yet a gloomy Con|tentment took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my Soul, &s;o that I could freely pardon the Man who was the Cau&s;e of all my Misfortunes. I was over|come with an ardent Longing to embrace him. All the Company felt the &s;ame Senti|ments with me; neither cou'd we prevent the Tears gu&s;hing from our Eyes, at my Brother's &s;hort Story.</P>
<P>We all return'd to Re&s;t; and I mu&s;t own, I had not felt the balmy Effects of Slumber &s;o &s;weet, for many Days. Tho' the latter Part of it was di&s;turb'd with a Dream of my dear <HI>I&s;abella</HI>; I thought &s;he appear'd before
<PB N="191" REF="193">
me with tho&s;e piercing Rays of Beauty, with which &s;he fir&s;t wounded my Soul. <HI>Can&s;t thou then for&s;ake me</HI> (&s;he cry'd) <HI>ungrateful Wretch? What have I done to merit &s;uch bar|barous U&s;age? Are the&s;e the Vows and Pro|mi&s;es thou made&s;t me at our cruel Separation? Why did&s;t thou betray my ea&s;y Heart, to feel the Torture of De&s;pair for ever? But know, thou Wretch! tho' Death will &s;oon overtake me, yet I will die another's, to puni&s;h thee.</HI> When &s;he had (as I thought) pronounc'd the&s;e fatal Words, &s;he flew from me in a violent Rage, and the Agony I felt in my Dream, awak'd me in a cold Sweat, all o'er my Limbs. Tho' this was but a Dream, yet my Mind felt all the Tortures imaginable, at the Thoughts of my mi&s;erable Fortune.</P>
<P>The next Morning, my Brother inform'd us the Gentleman was better, and expre&s;s'd a great De&s;ire to &s;ee me. After Breakfa&s;t, we all went up together. At Sight of me, the Tears ran down his Cheeks, which choak'd the Pa&s;&s;age of his Words for &s;ome time. For Heaven's &s;ake, Sir, &s;aid I, do not add to my Sorrows, by making me bear yours. I know your Penitence, and it is with the utmo&s;t Candour I now declare, I heartily forgive what is pa&s;t, and beg to be rank'd in the
<PB N="192" REF="194">
Number of your virtuous Friends. This Goodne&s;s, he faintly reply'd, had over|whelm'd his Soul with &s;o much Confu&s;ion, that it was more than his feeble Spirits cou'd &s;tand under; and, upon &s;aying that, his Speech fail'd him, and a deadly Palene&s;s over&s;pread his Face. It was a full Hour be|fore we cou'd bring him to Life again, and I began to ta&s;te all the Bitterne&s;s of Grief for his Condition. When he cou'd u&s;e his Tongue, he &s;aid &s;o many humane tender things, as plung'd all the Hearers in Floods of Sorrow, in&s;omuch, that the Surgeon turn'd us all out of the Chamber, declaring he would, upon the In&s;tant, leave him, if we of|fer'd to &s;ee him again, till he thought fit.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as we left him, a Packet was given me from <HI>England,</HI> which I knew to be my Uncle's Hand. I had not wrote him any Letter for near four Months, having indeed almo&s;t forgot (thro' my Brother's Affairs, my Sickne&s;s, and my own unhappy Love) I had any &s;uch Per&s;on in the World; and when I did call him to mind, the Intention of my Journey to <HI>England,</HI> made it of no Signification to write.

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Child,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Torments I endure for thy Silence, are not to be de&s;crib'd. It never can en|ter into my Mind, that thou &s;hould'&s;t forget me; therefore, what can I &s;uppo&s;e? Is it unnatural to think thee out of this World, and that I am now writing to an Angel in Heaven? Good God! what Terrors does the very Thought in|vade me with! My dear Boy, &s;hould this Let|ter come to thy Hands, con&s;ider me as one, in this &s;mall Time thou ha&s;t been ab&s;ent, full twen|ty Years older than when thou &s;awe&s;t me la&s;t. Grief has &s;hook her Malevolence upon my Head, and I am become, from a facetious middle-ag'd Man of Fifty, an old decrepid Wretch of Four|&s;core. Thy worthy Father's Lo&s;s, thy Ab&s;ence, and my Fears for thee, have added to my Grey Hairs, which, I own, are multiply'd by the Mother and Aunt to <HI>I&s;abella.</HI> Would'&s;t thou think it, my Boy? They are as &s;trange to me, as Humility to a Prie&s;t; have broke off our Cor|re&s;pondence; and, to compleat all (O, my Child! arm thy&s;elf with Patience, if my Con|jectures prove true) are &s;peedily going to wed <HI>I&s;abella</HI> to that up&s;tart Nobleman you formerly had &s;ome Words with: And all this, without a&s;&s;igning any Rea&s;on to me, for their Proceed|ings.

'Tis true, they have a Right to do as they think fit; but it is very &s;trange! And I own, my Patience and Fortitude, thro' all the&s;e concurring Misfortunes, can but poorly bear up again&s;t them alone. Come then, my dear Child! and, by thy A&s;&s;i&s;tance, I &s;hall be able to hold out again&s;t all the A&s;&s;aults of Fortune, and, in thy Company, forget the ill Treatment of the World. But if I neither &s;ee, nor hear from thee, very &s;peedily, my Gray Hairs will &s;oon be brought with Sorrow to the Grave. Poor <HI>Bet|ty</HI>'s Fears for thy Welfare, almo&s;t equal mine, I have taken care of ihy unhappy Father's Af|fairs; come, and take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that, and all that is mine: But be expeditious, my dear Child, or thou wilt come too late to clo&s;e the Eyes of</P>

<P>All my Sorrows were renew'd, at the read|ing this melancholy Epi&s;tle; and I began to cur&s;e my Stars, for my unthinking Backward|ne&s;s in Writing; and to write now, &s;eem'd to me to be of no U&s;e, becau&s;e I intended to embark for <HI>England</HI> the next Morning. How|ever, all my Friends advis'd me to &s;end my

Uncle a Letter, for fear &s;ome Accident might retard our Voyage. I took their Advice, and &s;ent him one, giving him a &s;uccinct Account of every thing that had be|fell my Brother and me, &s;ince my la&s;t; and of that fatal Letter, which had caus'd the Coldne&s;s of <HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s Family, and my inevi|table Ruin; with a Promi&s;e to be in <HI>England</HI> with the utmo&s;t Expedition.</P>
<P>The wounded Gentleman, hearing we were to imbark for <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> the next Morning, was re&s;olv'd to go with us, notwith&s;tanding his weak Condition, and all our Per&s;ua&s;ions to the contrary, cou'd not avail. The Sur|geon inform'd us the Sea would rather do him Good, than Harm, and he was re&s;olv'd to at|tend him to <HI>Mar&s;eilles.</HI> Therefore, the next Day, we left <HI>Leghorn</HI> with a pro&s;perous Gale, and in eight Days we arriv'd &s;afely at <HI>Mar|&s;eilles,</HI> without meeting with any Accident by the Way. The hurt Gentleman mended e|very Day, and when we di&s;embark'd, he was able to walk without A&s;&s;i&s;tance. He had re|concil'd him&s;elf to my Governor, and <HI>Eliza.</HI> The Pre&s;ents he made them were worthy the Gift of a Prince; and, unknown to me, he and my Brother, had &s;ettled my Father's E|&s;tate upon me, and had given my Brother an

Equivalent out of his own Fortune. When I complain'd to him of his profu&s;e Genero&s;i|ty; For Heaven's &s;ake, Sir, &s;aid he, accept this &s;mall Favour, in Recompence for all the Misfortunes I have heap'd upon you. And would to God, the re&s;t of my E&s;tate and Life cou'd but re&s;tore what I have robb'd you of, I would freely &s;urrender both. Yet, who knows but Fate has &s;till re&s;erv'd the amiable <HI>I&s;abella</HI> to ble&s;s your Arms! I am &s;trongly po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with that Hope. I have &s;ome Rea|&s;on to believe you the Care of Providence: And &s;uch Wretches, as that perfidious Man and I, mu&s;t &s;urely be puni&s;h'd, in the Lo&s;s of all our unlawful De&s;ires wou'd wi&s;h for. All my Days to come, &s;hall be &s;pent in beg|ging Forgivene&s;s from Heaven and you. Sure there mu&s;t be the Seeds of &s;ome Goodne&s;s, even in the mo&s;t profligate Heart, and repen|tant Tears may make them flouri&s;h, and kill tho&s;e Weeds of Ba&s;ene&s;s, that &s;hadow'd o'er our vicious Inclinations. I wou'd not be the Wretch I was &s;ome few Days ago, for all the gaudy Titles of State and Grandeur.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, there was &s;uch a virtuous Altera|tion wrought upon him, I cou'd not help e&s;teeming him equal to my Brother. His Friend&s;hip was, in &s;ome &s;ort, a Cordial for
<PB N="197" REF="199">
my di&s;appointed Love; for I had made a firm Re&s;olve, after the Lo&s;s of my dear <HI>I&s;a|bella,</HI> to forget all the fatal Charms of the Sex, which, at be&s;t, enervate the Soul of Man, unbend his Mind, and render him un|fit for noble Actions. I intended to dedicate my future Life to my King and Country: My new Friend &s;trengthen'd me in that Re&s;o|lution. Our De&s;ign was, as &s;oon as we ar|riv'd in <HI>England,</HI> to buy us Po&s;ts in the Ar|my, and make, for the future, War our Mi|&s;tre&s;s. The&s;e Thoughts almo&s;t engro&s;s'd my whole Soul; but the Idea of the charming <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> wou'd too often intrude, and fill my Heart with a Medley of Love and Arms.</P>
<P>We &s;et out from <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> in Po&s;t-Chai&s;es, for <HI>Paris,</HI> where we all &s;afely arriv'd, health|ful in Body; tho', for my own Part, with a Mind full of cruel Di&s;turbances. We were oblig'd to &s;tay &s;ome time here, to di&s;po&s;e of a Casket of valuable Jewels that <HI>Fatima</HI> brought from <HI>Tunis,</HI> and procure Bills of Ex|change for our Money, for fear of Accidents. But as &s;oon as we arriv'd there, I di&s;patch'd one of my Servants for <HI>England,</HI> to acquaint my Uncle of my coming. Here my Fever attack'd me again; but I was &s;o impatient to
<PB N="198" REF="200">
come to my Journey's End, that as &s;oon as our Affairs were ended, we hir'd Po&s;t-Chai&s;es for <HI>Bulloigne,</HI> where we &s;afely arriv'd, tho' late at Night, but found the Gates &s;hut a|gain&s;t us. But having Recommendations to Mr. <HI>Gordon,</HI> a Wine-Merchant, a Gentleman ju&s;t &s;ettled at <HI>Bulloigne,</HI> he prevail'd upon the Captain of the Guard to give us Entrance; and, thro' his accu&s;tom'd Good-nature, he wou'd accommodate us at his own Hou&s;e, where we were nobly entertain'd. He pre&s;t us &s;o oblingly to &s;tay &s;ome time, that we ap|pear'd almo&s;t guilty of Ill-manners; but De|&s;pair, and Love, &s;eldom regard Forms.</P>
<P>He, finding our Affairs pre&s;t us to be gone, procur'd us a Ve&s;&s;el to carry us to <HI>Dover,</HI> and we embark'd the next Morning, at break of Day; but before the Sun was two Hours old, a general Darkne&s;s o'er&s;pread the Hemi&s;phere, follow'd by a mo&s;t violent Tempe&s;t, mix'd with Thunder and Lightning, that the Cap|tain of the Ve&s;&s;el declar'd, he had never &s;een the like. The Helm was of no U&s;e, there|fore we were oblig'd, under a reef'd Fore&s;ail, to run before the Wind, tru&s;ting to the Mer|cy of Providence for three Nights and Days. Upon the fourth, the Storm retir'd, and gave us Leave to make an Ob&s;ervation; we
<PB N="199" REF="201">
were greatly &s;urpriz'd to find we had pa&s;s'd the <HI>Lizard.</HI> Upon this, we con&s;ulted what Cour&s;e we &s;hould &s;teer; but finding the Wind favourable for <HI>Milford</HI> Haven, the Captain was prevail'd upon, for a Sum of Money, to &s;teer for that Harbour. The Night ap|proaching, the Tempe&s;t (as if it abated only to fetch Breath) came on more violently than before, and all the Hopes we had of Life, was, to &s;teer our Cour&s;e for the open Sea. Our Ve&s;&s;el bore up again&s;t the Storm very well, for two Days; but on the third, the Ma&s;ter came into the Cabbin, with Looks that told us our Misfortune; he inform'd us, the Ve&s;&s;el had &s;prung a Leak, and, &s;hould the Storm continue a Day longer, we mu&s;t inevitably &s;ink to the Bottom.</P>
<P>The Tears of my Friends, I mu&s;t own, &s;hock'd me very much; yet, for my own Part, I &s;at in expectation of the la&s;t Moment, with the utmo&s;t Tranquillity. But in a few Hours, the Storm very much abated; yet, with all our A&s;&s;i&s;tance, the Water gain'd up|on us, and no Land appearing, we had no Hope of &s;aving our Lives.</P>
<P>The Ve&s;&s;el was, once more, left to the Mercy of the Waves, who&s;e frightful Swell, tho' the Wind was laid, ran Mountains high.
<PB N="200" REF="202">
The Ma&s;ter order'd the Long-boat out, that we might endeavour all we cou'd to &s;ave our Lives: But the Mariners, as &s;oon as it was in the Water, crowded &s;o fa&s;t upon one ano|ther, that the Rope which held it to the Ship's Side, broke, and in a Moment after, the Boat was &s;wallow'd by the Billows: Three out of thirteen of the Sailors, that were in it, &s;unk to the Bottom, never to be &s;een more alive. It was with the utmo&s;t Difficulty the re&s;t were &s;av'd. The Sailors finding no Hope of e&s;ca|ping that way, began to throw overboard their Guns, Water-Casks, and Provi&s;ion, and, by the Divine Providence, found out one of the Leaks, which they, with much Difficulty, &s;topt; and by continual plying the Pump, clear'd her of &s;ome Water: But the ince&s;|&s;ant Labour fatigu'd us all &s;o much, that we began to de&s;pair again. Yet Life being &s;weet, every Per&s;on in the Ve&s;&s;el put forth their ut|mo&s;t Strength, and labour'd hard all Night. In the Break of the Morning, we di&s;cover'd Land, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible Joy of the Sailors, and what Wind we had, pointed fair for the Place. But our Joy had like to have been more fatal than the Storm; for upon the fir&s;t Notice of di&s;covering Land, every Per&s;on ran upon Deck, like Madmen, to be confirm'd
<PB N="201" REF="203">
in the plea&s;ing News, never regarding the Pumps, till we found the Ve&s;&s;el almo&s;t &s;ink|ing under us: Yet the Hope of Life, in|&s;pir'd us with new Strength. We work'd as hard, as if the Sight of Shore had been a Day's Re&s;t from Labour. We had no Boat to land with, therefore the Captain made a Signal of Di&s;tre&s;s, and in le&s;s than an Hour, we &s;aw &s;everal Boats rowing towards us. The Captain wi&s;ely con&s;ider'd, if the&s;e Boats &s;hould come on Board, every one would be for get|ting into them, and leave the Ve&s;&s;el to &s;ink for want of Working; therefore he order'd Tow-Ropes out, that the approaching Boats might lend their A&s;&s;i&s;tance that way. Ac|cordingly, he acquainted the Sailors with his Intention, and they, with the Pa&s;&s;engers, ap|prov'd of it. The Boats, when they came near us, obey'd the Captain's Order, and in two Hours we arriv'd &s;afe in St. <HI>Aubin</HI>'s Bay, a Harbour in the I&s;land of <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The I&s;land of <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> (in <HI>Latin, Cae&s;area,</HI> from <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> who gave it his own Name.)

<P>This I&s;land is famous for Cider and Perry: But its Staple Commodity is the famous <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> Stockings, &s;o well known in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Air is mild, plea&s;ant, and not unwhol&s;ome. The Soil rich and fruitful. The very Hedges produce Apples and Pears, without planting; and the meane&s;t Cottage can accommodate you with a Cup of Cider or Perry. Their <HI>French</HI> Wheat is equal to any in <HI>France</HI>; and their other Grain as good as any in <HI>England.</HI> The Sea yields them Plenty of Fi&s;h; and Wild-Fowl innumerable.</P>
<P>This I&s;land, by a &s;trict Calculation, contains 23000 Inhabitants; and can rai&s;e in Defence of their Country (not including their Garri&s;ons) upwards of 6000 Fight|ing Men, It is above 30 Miles round, 10 in Length, and 5 in Breadth. The Inhabitants have, to the la&s;t, been in the Intere&s;t of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and more than once the Retreat of their di&s;tre&s;t Princes. The Earl of <HI>Richmond</HI> (afterwards <HI>Henry the Seventh</HI>) fir&s;t took Shelter here, and from hence went over to <HI>Britany,</HI> where he rais'd Forces &s;ufficient to gain the Crown, and puni&s;h <HI>Richard the Third</HI> for his bloody Reign.</P>
<P>King <HI>Charles</HI> II. made this Place the fir&s;t Stage of his Exile, during <HI>Oliver</HI>'s U&s;urpation. This I&s;land was the la&s;t Place that &s;urrender'd to the Parliament-Forces.

<P>Thro' their watchful Courage, they have often repuls'd the <HI>French,</HI> who have made many vain Attempts to graft this Scien to its ancient Stock.

to &s;ee a Man &s;tretch'd at his Length, upon a poor Flock-Bed on the Ground, without any Covering, meagre and pale, with at lea&s;t a hundred Pounds Weight of Irons about his Body; to me, he &s;eem'd as if his la&s;t Mo|ments were approaching. Compa&s;&s;ion took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my Soul, tho' I was convinc'd, by his own Di&s;cour&s;e, he de&s;erv'd but little.</P>
<P>A Sailor that was walking upon Deck, came up to me, and judging, by my Coun|tenance, that I &s;eem'd to pity the unfortunate Wretch, cry'd out, What, is he going? let him go, and be d&mdash;n'd! Friend (&s;aid I) let this poor Creature's Crimes be what they will, I mu&s;t own, I think his Condition de&s;erves Compa&s;&s;ion; therefore, I &s;hall be very much oblig'd to you, if you will free him from his Irons, that his Soul may take its Flight with the more Tranquillity. Sir (reply'd the Sai|lor) if you were acquainted with that Rogue's wicked Heart, you would believe no Puni&s;h|ment in this, or the next World, could be bad enough for him. O Sir! cry'd the un|fortunate Wretch, I de&s;erve every thing that Man &s;ays; but I have heartily repented of all the ill Actions I have committed, and only beg to die without this Load upon my Body. Some of the&s;e Irons have eat my Fle&s;h from
<PB N="210" REF="212">
the Bones; and, as I wear the Form of a Man, don't let me be treated in my Dying Moments, wor&s;e than a mad Bea&s;t ty'd to the Stake.</P>
<P>I us'd &s;o many Per&s;ua&s;ions, with the Rhe|torick of a Guinea, to the Per&s;on that &s;eem'd to have the Guard of him, that he was going to awake the Captain, and acquaint him with the poor Wretch's Condition, and my Re|que&s;t to have him releas'd from his Fetters; but the Captain that Moment came out of his Cabbin, being di&s;turb'd with our Conver&s;a|tion, and, at my Intreaty, order'd his Irons to be taken off. As &s;oon as he was freed from them, he gave me Thanks for the Service I had done him, and ri&s;ing &s;lowly from his Bed whereon he lay, &s;eiz'd upon &s;ome of the Irons he was releas'd from, and &s;truck the Sailor (that was talking to me before the Captain came out of his Cabbin) with &s;uch Violence, that we all believ'd he was kill'd; then made a Blow at the Captain, which he happily a|voided, by &s;tarting a&s;ide; but perceiving the Sailors running from all Parts of the Ship to &s;eize him, he threw him&s;elf overboard mau|gre all they could do to prevent him, crying, he had in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;atisfy'd his Revenge, and was never &s;een more.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="213">All this was done &s;o &s;uddenly, that I &s;tood quite confounded, imagining I was in a Dream. But when we began to recollect our&s;elves, we went to &s;ee if the Sailor was alive or dead. We took him up, and I mu&s;t own, I was very well pleas'd to find he was only &s;tunn'd with the Blow. In a little time he came to his Sen&s;es; and the fir&s;t Words he &s;poke were, G&mdash;d D&mdash;n him, for a Son of a B&mdash;h! who wou'd have thought he had &s;o much Strength left? But I'll prevent him giving another Blow! Upon &s;aying this, he ran up and down the Deck, with his Cutla&s;s drawn (he being one of the Centries at the great Cab|bin Door) to &s;eek for him, to make an end of him, but when he was inform'd of his ra&s;h Cata&s;trophe, he &s;eem'd to be unea&s;y that he had not the killing of him with his own Hand.</P>
<P>By this time, my Brother, <HI>Clerimont,</HI> and the Ladies, were alarm'd, and came about us, to know the Cau&s;e of the Di&s;turbance. I told 'em, 'twas the fir&s;t time I ever found Compa&s;&s;ion a dangerous Virtue. We begg'd of the Captain to let us into the Affair. He told us, at Dinner it &s;hou'd be our De&s;ert, in|&s;tead of Fruit. While this Combu&s;tion hap|pen'd, the Man at the Helm had di&s;regarded
<PB N="212" REF="214">
the Steerage, &s;o that the Sails clap'd to the Ma&s;ts, and the Ship &s;taid &s;ome time; but even this &s;eem'd the Providence of Heaven, for, had we continu'd our Cour&s;e, it being a very hazy Morning, we &s;hou'd have run upon the Shallows of the <HI>Great Sark</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Great Sark,</HI> is a &s;mall I&s;land about three Leagues from <HI>Guern&s;ey.</HI> It formerly belong'd to the <HI>French,</HI> but the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> took it from them by Stratagem. There is but one &s;mall Town, and three or four little Villages, on the whole I&s;land. It was given by the Crown to the <HI>Carteret</HI> Family, who are Lords of <HI>Sark.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thank Heaven! &s;aid the Captain, this Wretch, after endeavouring to fru&s;trate our Voyage by the mo&s;t wicked De&s;igns could ever enter the Mind of Man, &s;eems intended by Providence to be the Means of &s;aving us, and, like <HI>Jonah</HI> in the Ship of <HI>Joppa,</HI> now he has abandon'd our Ve&s;&s;el, we &s;hall have all Dangers cea&s;e.</P>
<P>When the Ship had her true Way again, the Captain order'd the Wretches Bedding and Cloaths to be examin'd, and thrown over|board: In &s;earching the Pockets of an old pair of Breeches, they found a written Paper, with a Pencil, which he read to the Company, as follows:
<LETTER>
<PB N="213" REF="215">
<P>IF Heaven for&s;akes me, Hell will receive me with open Arms. I have endeavour'd to repent, but &s;till find my Mind bent on Revenge, and I will hazard my Body and Soul to accom|pli&s;h it.

</LETTER></P>
<P>This terrible Declaration, made me very much repent my Good-nature. I could hard|ly think there had been &s;uch a wicked Villain in the World.</P>
<P>After Dinner, we begg'd Captain <HI>Brooks</HI> to relate the Hi&s;tory of this Wretch; which he did in the following manner:</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid he (directing his Di&s;cour&s;e to me, having &s;ome &s;mall Knowledge of him) you know my Cou&s;in <HI>Bridgford,</HI> the old Acquain|tance of your good Uncle, made me Captain of the <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> in con&s;ideration of &s;ome
<PB N="214" REF="216">
Services he was pleas'd to own I did him. This Wretch, who is gone to the other World, to an&s;wer for his Crimes in this, through my Intreaty, was made chief Mate; and behav'd hone&s;tly as &s;uch, during our Trading-Voyage to the <HI>Indies.</HI> In our Return, near the Lati|tude of <HI>St. Helena,</HI> where we were bound for &s;ome Refre&s;hment, in the middle of a dark Night, we heard &s;ome Guns fir'd, that &s;eem'd to us as if &s;ome Ve&s;&s;el was in Di&s;tre&s;s; I or|der'd our Ship to &s;teer the Cour&s;e from whence the Fire came; but in an Hour afterwards, we heard &s;uch a terrible Report, that we all concluded the unfortunate Ve&s;&s;el was blown into the Air. However, I kept on my Cour&s;e, to &s;ee if I cou'd a&s;&s;i&s;t any of the unfortunate Wretches, that (no doubt) had either got in|to their Boat, or had thrown them&s;elves into the Water, to avoid the Flames, hanging out Lights about &s;everal Parts of my Ship, that they might &s;ee where to come for Suc|cour.</P>
<P>In le&s;s than an Hour more, &s;ome of our Crew cou'd perceive a Boat rowing towards us, full of Men. As &s;oon as they came up with us, they begg'd for Heaven's &s;ake, to be taken on Board. I, who had no other In|tention, mov'd by Compa&s;&s;ion, con&s;idering
<PB N="215" REF="217">
it might have been our own Ca&s;e, invited 'em kindly on Board. When they were a little recover'd from their Fright, they inform'd me, they belong'd to a Ship bound for <HI>Cork</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromandel,</HI> and had, by a violent Storm, been drove out of their Cour&s;e; that in the beginning of the Night, a Fire broke out in the Gun-Room, burning with &s;uch Fury, that all their Endeavours to extingui&s;h it prov'd fruitle&s;s; therefore they hoi&s;ted out their Long-Boat, and with one Barrel of Water, and two Casks of Bisket, abandon'd their Ship; and in half an Hour after they left it, they &s;aw it blow up, &s;everal Pieces of the Ve&s;&s;el falling with|in twenty Yards of 'em.</P>
<P>There were &s;eventeen Men in the Boat, their Ma&s;ter being one of them, who&s;e Name was <HI>Cox</HI>; but ob&s;erving he was very much wounded in the Head, I order'd our Surgeon to dre&s;s him immediately, who inform'd me his Skull was fractur'd, and he thought it &s;eem'd to be a Blow with a Cutla&s;s: But the Sailors that came with him in the Boat, told us he aro&s;e up ha&s;tily, at the fir&s;t Noi&s;e a|bout the Fire, and hurrying down the Lad|der that goes under Deck, fell with his Head on the Edge of a Bucket. When he came
<PB N="216" REF="218">
to his Sen&s;es (for the Pain of Dre&s;&s;ing had flung him into a Swoon) he told us the &s;ame Story. Yet &s;till, the Surgeon in&s;i&s;ted it cou'd be no &s;uch thing, and began to in&s;til, I know not what Notions, into my Mind, that the&s;e Men might be Villains. I own, he a little &s;tagger'd my Faith at fir&s;t; but when I con&s;ider'd their Condition, I thought it im|po&s;&s;ible. However, I determin'd to leave 'em all at <HI>St. Helena,</HI> becau&s;e, indeed, there were too many Mouths for me to maintain in our Voyage for <HI>England.</HI> I gave 'em all the Refre&s;hment my Ship cou'd afford, and they return'd me Thanks in &s;o &s;incere a manner, that quite obliterated tho&s;e Notions the Sur|geon had of them. The Captain I put in my own Cabbin, u&s;ing him, as I thought an hone&s;t unfortunate Man, in his Condition, de&s;erv'd, and &s;uch as I &s;hould have been pleas'd to meet with, upon the like unfortu|nate Accident.</P>
<P>In two Days after this, we arriv'd &s;afe at <HI>St. Helena</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The I&s;land of <HI>St. Helena</HI> was di&s;cover'd upon <HI>St. Helen</HI>'s Day, in the Year 1502, by <HI>John de Nova,</HI> a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI>; it is now in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> It is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4 letters">&s;t &s;urrounded with Rocks; and reckon'd the far|the&s;t I&s;land from the Continent, of any in the known world.

It is very well inhabited, but they dwell in the Vallies; except when the Ships arrive, when they repair to the Fort with their Provi&s;ions for the Ships, every Trader having a Warehou&s;e in the Town, where they barter with the Sailors for Nece&s;&s;aries, &s;eldom any Money pa&s;&s;ing between them.

Sailors on Shore, with this Rea&s;on, that my Ship was too deep laden to be incumber'd with &s;o many &s;uperfluous Men.</P>
<P>I went to wait on the Governor on Shore, and contracted with him for what fre&s;h Pro|vi&s;ions I wanted, intending to &s;et Sail in eight Days; but the Governor advis'd me to &s;tay longer, a&s;&s;uring me, that &s;everal Ships would arrive before that Time, that would accom|pany me in our Voyage home. On that Ac|count, I re&s;olv'd to take his Advice. I &s;ent on Board for &s;ome Nece&s;&s;aries, becau&s;e I in|tended to take a Lodging in the Valley for a

Fortnight, to enjoy the Air of the Country. But my Surgeon being inform'd of my Inten|tion, came with my Servant in the Boat, with the Things I had &s;ent for, importuning me &s;o &s;trongly not to lie out of the Ship, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> I return'd on Board with him, purely to make him ea&s;y; for, I mu&s;t own, his Apprehen|&s;ions did not give me the lea&s;t Inquietude.</P>
<P><HI>Homes</HI> (the Name of the Wretch that is &s;o lately gone to Perdition) complain'd he was very much troubled with the Scurvy, there|fore intreated the Favour of going on Shore for a few Days. I cou'd not refu&s;e him; neither had I any Apprehen&s;ion of an ill De|&s;ign from him, having ever behav'd in the Voyage, like a downright hone&s;t Man, en|tirely in our Owner's Intere&s;t. We &s;taid twenty Days in the Harbour, without the Appearance of any Ship from the Ea&s;t, therefore I made a Re&s;olution of pur&s;uing our intended Voyage, if no Ve&s;&s;el arriv'd to bear us company, in four Days: Accordingly, I gave Notice to the Governor of my Inten|tion, as u&s;ual, that the Inhabitants, if they had any Demands, might be &s;atisfy'd before we &s;et Sail.</P>
<P>I went to re&s;t that Night with a Tremor upon my Spirits, and an unaccountable Me|lancholy,
<PB N="219" REF="221">
that &s;eem'd a foreboding ill Omen. About Midnight, the Surgeon came into my Cabbin, and awak'd me, with a very great Surprize in his Countenance. His Looks, I own, very much alarm'd me. What's the matter with you, Mr. <HI>We&s;twood?</HI> &s;aid I (that's the Name of my Surgeon) you &s;eem in &s;ome Di&s;order! Sir (reply'd Mr. <HI>We&s;twood</HI>) here's a Man has &s;wam from Shore, in the middle of a &s;tormy Night, to give you Notice of approaching Danger; and, I mu&s;t own, I have been in &s;uch a continual Lowne&s;s of Spirits, that I am well a&s;&s;ur'd &s;ome ill De|&s;igns are hatching again&s;t our Welfare; there|fore pray ri&s;e, and hear what the Per&s;on has to &s;ay, for he will not communicate it to any one but your&s;elf. I aro&s;e upon the In&s;tant, and de&s;ired him to bring in the Man. He brought him into the Cabbin, naked as he was. As &s;oon as I &s;aw him, I knew him for one of the Per&s;ons that came to us in the Boat. Sir, &s;aid he, I have &s;omething to in|form you of, that requires your private Ear. My Friend (I reply'd) this Gentleman is one whom I can entirely tru&s;t, therefore what you have to communicate to me, he may hear. If &s;o, Sir, reply'd the Man, I &s;hall proceed. However, Sir, &s;aid I, I beg the Favour
<PB N="220" REF="222">
(&s;ince you came naked for my Service, as I &s;uppo&s;e) that you will put on this Nightgown. Sir, return'd the Man, I'll accept of your Fa|vour; tho' I feel nothing of the Inclemency of the Weather, becau&s;e my Concern for you has fill'd up all my Thoughts: I therefore will proceed to tell you what I know, that you may be prepar'd for the Event. Mr. <HI>Homes,</HI> your chief Mate, has form'd the blacke&s;t De|&s;ign, that cou'd ever enter into the Soul of the mo&s;t Profligate. In le&s;s than two Hours, he will &s;eize your Ship, and put to Death You, and Mr. <HI>We&s;twood,</HI> with every Sailor that will not come into his black De&s;ign. I own my&s;elf one of the Confederates, but with no other Motive, than to u&s;e my utmo&s;t En|deavours to prevent it, if Heaven will per|mit: Therefore acquaint your Men with the Danger approaching, arm 'em immediately, and prevent 'em, if po&s;&s;ible; at lea&s;t, &s;ell your Lives like Men that have de&s;erv'd a bet|ter Fate. I was eager to enquire about this Affair; but the Man told me, I had no Time to lo&s;e; fir&s;t arm your Men, &s;aid he, and when you are in Readine&s;s to receive them, I'll acquaint you with the Con&s;piracy again&s;t you.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="223">I then order'd the Watch to awake tho&s;e that were gone to Re&s;t; and when they were all upon Deck, with their Arms in their Hands, I call'd the Man, and de&s;ired he would communicate the Story to the whole Crew, which con&s;i&s;ted of Fifty-four Men. We made a Circle round him upon the Quar|ter-Deck, and he began as follows:</P>
<P>Gentlemen, you all know me (I believe) to be one of tho&s;e Men, whom the Huma|nity of your Captain &s;av'd from imminent Death, therefore I think he has a Right to my Life and Fortune. Every Per&s;on, be&s;ide my&s;elf, that his Compa&s;&s;ion gave Means of Life to, have de&s;erv'd the Halter more than once. Their Number was much greater, their Crew con&s;i&s;ting of 120 Men, when they &s;et out from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guiney</HI>; but the Day before the Night you &s;av'd us from the devouring Waves, we had a terrible Engage|ment with a <HI>Dutch</HI> Man of War, in which we lo&s;t above half our Men, <HI>Homes,</HI> the Captain, mi&s;taking her for an <HI>Indian</HI> Trader, that we had Advice of from the <HI>Guiney</HI> Coa&s;t. Our Ship taking Fire, by what Accident, I know not, the <HI>Dutch</HI> Man of War's Men that had boarded us, and wou'd have cer|tainly
<PB N="222" REF="224">
taken us, left us; fearing, as we &s;up|pos'd, they might &s;uffer by us, if we blew up; and &s;ail'd away: The Fire was &s;o &s;ud|den, that we had but a &s;mall time to hoi&s;t out our Long-boat. The Captain, and &s;ix|teen of us got into it; but many other of the Wretches endeavouring to get in, were bar|barou&s;ly murder'd by the other Sailors. We row'd as fa&s;t as we cou'd from the burning Ship; but the Cries of the Wretches we left behind, methinks, are &s;till in my Ears. It was no &s;mall Joy to us, when we perceiv'd your Lights hung out. But the Wretch, the Captain, tho' &s;o dangerou&s;ly wounded, de|clar'd, if he thought he &s;hou'd have met with a Ship &s;o &s;oon, he wou'd have taken all the Men he cou'd, that he might have been able to have taken the Ship that was coming to his Re&s;cue. But &s;ince it is as it is, &s;aid he, we mu&s;t make the be&s;t of a bad Market, and wait for &s;ome Opportunity to get another Ship. Then we con&s;ulted how to impo&s;e on you with a fal&s;e Story, and trump'd up That they told you; for the Wound the Captain has upon his Head, was given by a <HI>Dutchman</HI> in the Fight. Pray, &s;aid the Sur|geon, how came you among &s;uch a Crew of Villains? Why, Sir, I'll tell you, reply'd
<PB N="223" REF="225">
the Man; I belong'd to a Coa&s;t Sloop in the River of <HI>Gambo,</HI> where all my Crew were murder'd, but one, by the Negroes, who had inviegled them up into the Country. The poor Man that made his E&s;cape, had but ju&s;t time to tell me the fatal News, ere Death overtook him, from the Wounds he had receiv'd. I had &s;carce time to cut my Cable, and drive out to Sea, favour'd by the Wind and Tide of Ebb, when I perceiv'd about twenty Boats coming down the River, in order to &s;eize my Sloop, and, no doubt, to make me partake of the &s;ame Fate with my unfortunate Men; which I certainly &s;hould have done, for they would have over|taken me in a couple of Hours, if both they and I had not perceiv'd a Ship in the <HI>Offin,</HI> which prov'd to be this Wretch and his Crew. I made them a Signal of my Di&s;tre&s;s, which they perceiving, made up to me, and took me on Board; but the Negroes left their Pur&s;uit, as &s;oon as ever they di&s;cover'd the Ship.</P>
<P>I &s;oon found, to my Sorrow, what Com|pany I was got into; but it was to no Pur|po&s;e to complain, for the Captain &s;eiz'd my Ve&s;&s;el, took out every thing that &s;eem'd u&s;e|ful, and &s;unk her, with this Pretence, He
<PB N="224" REF="226">
fear'd his Men might take it into their Heads to leave him, and &s;et up for them&s;elves; tho', I mu&s;t own, he promis'd to pay me for my Cargo, and give me my Liberty the fir&s;t Opportunity; but tho&s;e were but Words, and what I verily believe he never intended to per|form.</P>
<P>I often ob&s;erv'd your Mate, during the time we were &s;ailing to this I&s;land (after you kindly took us in) caballing privately with our Captain, and &s;everal of our Men; but had no Notion of their wicked Intention to &s;eize your Ship, till Ye&s;terday Morning, be|ing at a Planter's in the <HI>South Valley,</HI> where I was treated with &s;ome Palm Wine, and not being us'd to drink in a Morning, it got in|to my Head; finding my&s;elf inclin'd to &s;leep, I laid my&s;elf down under a Hedge, but be|fore I had clos'd my Eyes, I was interrupted by the Voices of our Captain, and your Mate. By their Di&s;cour&s;e, I found out their black De&s;ign; and their Bu&s;ine&s;s to that Plantation was, to communicate the Affair to me; but I under&s;tood, if I did not come into it, it was their Intention to murder me. I imme|diately aro&s;e from the Place, full of unquiet Thoughts, which brought me out of my drunken Fit. I took care to get as far from
<PB N="225" REF="227">
the Hedge as I cou'd, that they might not &s;u&s;pect I had overheard 'em. It was a full Quarter of an Hour before they found me out, and in that time I had compos'd my|&s;elf, as well as I cou'd. When they came up with me, they ask'd me, if I wou'd take a Walk to the next Plantation, where two of them lodg'd. I an&s;wer'd, very willing|ly, Yes.</P>
<P>When we came to the Bridge that was built over the River, they &s;top'd, and open'd the whole Affair to me. I made no He&s;ita|tion, but enter'd into their De&s;ign with a &s;eeming Joy; for if I had not, I don't doubt but it was their Intention to throw me into the River. Nay, their very Looks declar'd as much.</P>
<P>At Three o' Clock this Morning, your Mate, with the re&s;t, are to board you, arm'd every Man with a Cutla&s;s, and two Brace of Pi&s;tols, &s;ecure the Watch, and kill every one that will not take part in their villainous Un|dertaking; then weigh Anchor, and &s;ail for the <HI>Bermudas,</HI> where they will di&s;po&s;e of the Cargo, and then &s;et out upon the Pirating account.</P>
<P>When he had fini&s;h'd his &s;hort, but terri|ble Relation, the Sailors cry'd out, they
<PB N="226" REF="228">
wou'd have the Long-boat, and meet them with &s;uch a Reception, that &s;hou'd make 'em repent their Undertaking: But the Surgeon and I per&s;uaded them, it would be better, and &s;afer, to counterwork them. We therefore a|greed to charge all our Guns with Musket-Ball, and if they offer'd to come on, when we order'd them to return, the Sailors &s;hou'd fire upon 'em. However, eight of my Men prevail'd upon me to have the Long-boat rea|dy, to pur&s;ue them, and bring 'em Pri&s;oners, in order to be puni&s;h'd for their treacherous Intention.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, we provided again&s;t every thing, and in half an Hour after we were prepar'd to receive 'em, we heard their Oars in the Wa|ter. We let 'em come within three Ships Length of us, and then call'd to 'em to pro|ceed no farther. As they (I believe) did not expect to be hinder'd in their Boarding us, they lay upon their Oars, and ask'd me what I was afraid of. <HI>Homes</HI> was the chief Speak|er, who I &s;oon gave to under&s;tand, I knew his vile Intention. If it be &s;o (he cry'd out) we have no Time to dally. Come, my Lads, we'll &s;oon &s;ee who are to be Ma&s;ters, they, or we. Upon that, they row'd towards us with all their Strength, with their Cutla&s;&s;es drawn,
<PB N="227" REF="229">
and Pi&s;tols in their Hands. But before they reach'd us, we fir'd upon 'em with our Dou|ble and Round, which kill'd four of their Num|ber, and wounded &s;everal. Their Confu&s;ion was &s;o great, at this unexpected Reception, that they row'd a-head of us, where our Guns cou'd not bear upon them. While I was or|dering my Men upon the Foreca&s;tle to fire upon them, I perceiv'd the Ship driving, for that Wretch, <HI>Homes,</HI> had cut my Cable.</P>
<P>The Tide, by good Fortune, was ebbing; for had it been Tide of Flood, we mu&s;t have drove upon the Rocks, before we cou'd have ca&s;t another Anchor. In the Confu&s;ion, the Boat row'd to board us; but my Men fir'd upon them once more, in the &s;ame manner as at fir&s;t, which put 'em in much Di&s;order. Our Ship &s;till driving, I order'd 'em to ca&s;t An|chor. However, they took &s;o much Time in doing it, that we were a Quarter of a League from the Pirates, before the Anchor fell. In the mean time, our Long-boat, with the eight Men, got up to the Pirates, and a de&s;perate Engagement follow'd. What trou|bled me was, that I cou'd not a&s;&s;i&s;t 'em, for if I had fir'd my Guns with Ball, which cou'd ea&s;ily reach 'em, I might have de&s;troy'd my Friends with my Enemies. My Men
<PB N="228" REF="230">
were &s;wearing, cur&s;ing, and banning at this unfore&s;een Accident; nay, &s;ome of 'em were for &s;tripping, with an Intention to &s;wim na|ked to help 'em, never once con&s;idering the Tide of Ebb wou'd prevent 'em. But what was the more extraordinary in this Confu&s;ion, not one of us, for &s;ome time, thought of our Yawl upon the Booms. But as &s;oon as I men|tion'd it, they got it into the Water in a Mo|ment, threw them&s;elves into it with &s;o much Precipitation, that their Ha&s;te had almo&s;t over&s;et it, and row'd away with &s;o much Strength, that they &s;oon got up to the A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of their Comrades in good time, for two of 'em were kill'd, and the other &s;ix very much wounded. Their Firing (we ob&s;erv'd) had ceas'd &s;ome time, having di&s;charg'd all their Fire-Arms; and if the Yawl had not arriv'd as it did, the other &s;ix of my Men had certainly been cut to pieces; but this Re|inforcement &s;oon put an end to the Fight, by the Death of all the Pirates but two, and <HI>Homes,</HI> who were very much wounded.</P>
<P>When they were brought on Board, my Men were for tearing them to pieces, e&s;peci|ally <HI>Homes</HI>; but I pacify'd them a little, by telling 'em they &s;hou'd be re&s;erv'd for the Pu|ni&s;hment due to their Crimes, when we arriv'd in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="231">My Surgeon dre&s;s'd their Wounds, and, by good Fortune, all my own Men recover'd; but the two Pirates dy'd in our Voyage home. The vile Wretch, <HI>Homes,</HI> while his Hurts were healing, us'd to utter &s;uch bla&s;phemous Imprecations, that &s;hock'd all the Crew. When he was fully recover'd, I order'd him to be manacled, leaving his Legs at Liberty, with two Men to guard him. He often at|tempted to throw him&s;elf overboard, and was as often prevented.</P>
<P>About a Month ago, as he was walking upon Deck, with his two Guards, he ob&s;erv'd Mr. <HI>Mullart,</HI> (the Per&s;on that &s;wam on Board to give us Notice of their De&s;ign) &s;tanding upon the Gunnel of the Ship, to look at a dead Whale that was floating near us. He goes up to him, unob&s;erv'd, and pu&s;h'd him into the Sea. As it fell out, the Sea was ve|ry calm, tho' we had Wind enough to fill our Sails; otherwi&s;e, tho' a good Swimmer, he might have peri&s;h'd. We brought to, with all the Celerity imaginable, and not without &s;ome Difficulty, &s;av'd him.</P>
<P>One of the Sailors upbraiding him for the Cruelty of the Action, he &s;truck him in the Face, broke his Jaw, and beat out three of his Teeth, with his Hand-Cuffs. I &s;eeing
<PB N="230" REF="232">
this vile Proceeding, order'd him to be &s;eiz'd and fetter'd; but it was with much Difficul|ty, for he laid about him with &s;uch Agility and Vigor, that a Carpenter was oblig'd to knock him down with a Hand-Spike. When he came to him&s;elf (for the Blow had &s;tunn'd him for &s;ome time) he &s;wore he was &s;orry for nothing, but that <HI>Mullart</HI> was not gone to Hell by Water.</P>
<P>As I was giving Orders how he &s;hou'd be us'd for the future, he grinn'd at me, gave me &s;everal hearty Cur&s;es, and &s;pit in my Face, which, I own, provok'd me to &s;trike him. He was then laid in the manner you &s;aw him this Morning.</P>
<P>About a Week ago, he began to think of his Crimes, and &s;eem'd &s;o penitent, that I or|der'd his Irons to be taken off, had him bath'd, &s;hifted, and clean'd. When his Cloaths were on again, Mr. <HI>Mullart</HI> being upon Deck, he very &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively approach'd him, telling him, he was very &s;orry for what he had done to him; but as &s;oon as ever he got within his Reach, he flew upon him, got him down, and in his Fury wou'd have &s;trangled him, if if he had not been taken away by main Force.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="233">We all thought it high time to make him as &s;ecure as po&s;&s;ible, for &s;uch an infernal Wretch never more cou'd de&s;erve Compa&s;|&s;ion. For the&s;e la&s;t three Days, his Centries have thought him near his Death; but it was only his Artifice, to get clear once more, that he might do more Mi&s;chief in his la&s;t Mo|ments.</P>
<P>When Mr. <HI>Brooks</HI> had ended his Story, we all thought it impo&s;&s;ible Nature &s;hould fur|ni&s;h out &s;uch a Villain. And yet, &s;aid the Captain, this Wretch has made more than one Voyage with me, and ever &s;eem'd a Man of Integrity; an open and free Countenance, that di&s;cover'd no Rancour or Ba&s;ene&s;s in it. But, as <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> &s;ays, <HI>There's no Art to find the Mind's Con&s;truction in the Face.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;ail'd on with a favourable Gale, bend|ing our Cour&s;e for the <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Channel, where Captain <HI>Brooks</HI> was bound. On the fourth Day after our leaving <HI>Guern&s;ey,</HI> we di&s;cover'd the chalky Cliffs of our Native Country, which gave a &s;udden Alteration to the Fea|tures of every one of the Company; all but my&s;elf, wore a plea&s;ing Contentment on their Countenances; but, for my own part, my Mind felt &s;o many Vici&s;&s;itudes, that the wi&s;e&s;t
<PB N="232" REF="234">
Phy&s;iognomi&s;t, I believe, wou'd have been puzzled to have known my Thoughts; but no Wonder, for I knew 'em not my&s;elf. All the Pa&s;&s;ions of Love, Duty, Hatred, Jea|lou&s;y, Revenge, and Death, mix'd in &s;uch a general Tumult, that all within was wild A|narchy and Uproar. The Thoughts of &s;ee|ing my Native Country, which fill'd every one el&s;e with the utmo&s;t Tran&s;ports, gave me no other Satisfaction, than the Hopes of Death, to put an end to Thought, and all my devouring Sorrows.</P>
<P>In two Days more, we came to an Anchor near the Landing-Place of the I&s;land of <HI>Lun|dy</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The I&s;land of <HI>Lundy</HI> is an I&s;land five Miles long, and two broad, &s;urrounded with Rocks, in the middle of the <HI>Severn</HI> Sea, near the Coa&s;t of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> thinly inhabited; and altho' &s;eated in the Salt Ocean, yet there are many Springs of excellent Fre&s;h-Water, and prodi|giou&s;ly &s;tock'd with Wild-Fowl.</NOTE>, where we found a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el bound for <HI>Monmouth.</HI> As that Place was but a Day's Journey from mo&s;t of our Dwellings, we took Leave of Captain <HI>Brooks,</HI> and embark'd in that Ve&s;&s;el for <HI>Monmouth.</HI> The Captain parted from us with very great Regret, but with a Promi&s;e to &s;ee us in a few Days after

his Arrival at <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI> We weigh'd Anchor together, and kept Company, till we arriv'd at the Mouth of the <HI>Avon,</HI> that leads to <HI>Bri|&s;tol,</HI> and then parted, after receiving &s;everal Guns from the <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> by way of Salute. We arriv'd that Night at <HI>Chep&s;tow,</HI> upon the River <HI>Wye,</HI> where all the Company de&s;ir'd to be &s;et on Shore, for they were very much fa|tigu'd, particularly the Ladies.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as ever we landed, I &s;ent one of my Servants to acquaint my Uncle with my Ar|rival, and of my Intentions to wait on him in three Days, at the farthe&s;t; with Orders to my Servant to meet me at <HI>Monmouth</HI> the next Day, where we arriv'd by Noon. I found my Servant waiting for me, who in|form'd me, that my Uncle and Mrs. <HI>Betty</HI> had been gone to <HI>London</HI> four Days before, to wait my Arrival there. I own, I was both griev'd, and pleas'd; griev'd, that I &s;hould not &s;ee my dear Uncle &s;o &s;oon as I expected; and pleas'd, to know that he had receiv'd my Letters, and had Strength and Health enough to travel.</P>
<P>Now De&s;pair, with all its black Train of Horrors, fully po&s;&s;e&s;s'd my Soul; yet gave me Light enough to &s;ee, I &s;hou'd never po&s;|&s;e&s;s my dear <HI>I&s;abella!</HI> All Hopes were ba|ni&s;h'd,
<PB N="234" REF="236">
and the nearer I drew to the Re&s;idence of my adorable Fair One, the farther I drew from all Thoughts of Happine&s;s. What Pains, what Mi&s;eries, what Anxieties, and what inexpre&s;&s;ible Tortures, was my broken Heart torn with! Treading upon the &s;ame Earth, and breathing the &s;ame Air with my dear Love, for ever debarr'd my Arms, only added to my various Torments.</P>
<P>I went to Re&s;t, but alas! the Fatigues of the Sea, the Weakne&s;s of my Body, and the want of Sleep, were over-balanc'd by the Tortures of my Mind.</P>
<P>I aro&s;e in the Morning, without ever clo|&s;ing my Eyes, which had made &s;uch an Al|teration in my Countenance, that I was hard|ly known by my Friends: They were too well acquainted with the Cau&s;e, yet, notwith&s;tand|ing, endeavour'd to comfort me. But alas! they might as well have &s;topt the Fury of a Tempe&s;t, or the &s;wifte&s;t Current in its rapid Cour&s;e, as give Advice to heal my wounded Soul.</P>
<P>My Friend was incon&s;olable, well know|ing my Ruin was the Work of his unlucky forming; and maugre my ill Fate, I was compell'd to &s;mother my Heart-breaking Sor|rows, in order to comfort him, who now

<P>The Tortures of my Mind prey'd &s;o vio|lently on my Body, that I was once more hur|ry'd to the dark Confines of Death.

<P>WHAT envious Stars, divine <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> have wrought this Murder on my Love! But why do I 'tax the Stars, when it was the Work of fal&s;e Malice and Treachery.

</LETTER>
<P>My Spirits, with my Tears and Sighs, had left me, and it was &s;ome time ere I had Strength enough to fold the Letter, and di|rect it <HI>To the Divine</HI> I&s;abella.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="239">I order'd my Servant that had accompany'd me in my Travels, to find her out, and if it was po&s;&s;ible, to give it into her own Hands. Ob&s;erve (&s;aid I) her Countenance; tell her the unhappy Condition of thy Ma&s;ter. I will, if it be po&s;&s;ible, keep Life till thy Return, that I may have the Plea&s;ure in Dying, to hear &s;he has dropt a Tear for all my Misfortunes. He promis'd to execute his Commi&s;&s;ion with the utmo&s;t Diligence.</P>
<P>The next Day he return'd, with a dejected Countenance, and inform'd me that <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> her Mother, and Aunt, had been gone &s;ome Days from their Hou&s;e, but none of the Ser|vants cou'd inform him whither. He al&s;o in|quir'd of the Neighbourhood, but to as little Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>This &s;truck me into the la&s;t Depth of De|&s;pair, in&s;omuch, that I re&s;olv'd to put a Pe|riod to my Life. I refus'd all Phy&s;ic, Nou|ri&s;hment, and Re&s;t, and de&s;pis'd the Intrea|ties of my Brother and his Friends. I in|form'd 'em, no one upon Earth, not my dear Uncle, &s;hou'd de&s;troy my Re&s;olution of Dy|ing, if he arriv'd before I expir'd. They pre&s;s'd me with their Tears and Sighs, but all in vain: Till at la&s;t, they prevail'd upon me to hear the Prayers of a worthy Clergyman,
<PB N="238" REF="240">
who &s;o effectually cur'd me of De&s;pair, by laying before me the never-forgiven Sin of Self-Murder, that I &s;ubmitted to all their De|&s;ires. The Phy&s;icians pre&s;crib'd, I took their Medicines, receiv'd what they intended for Nouri&s;hment, and addre&s;s'd my&s;elf to Sleep; yet all to no purpo&s;e. Death glar'd me full in the Face, tho' all his Terrors cou'd not fright me. I look'd upon him as the only Cure for a broken Heart. The Conver&s;ation with my good Prie&s;t, had, I thank Heaven, &s;ettled my Con&s;cience. I expected Death's Approach, as that of my be&s;t Friend, and hop'd to &s;ee him before my Uncle, that I might not be a living Witne&s;s to all his Heart-rend|ing Griefs. They gave me Medicines to make me &s;leep; but, alas! the Agonies I felt, in what the Apothecaries call <HI>Compo&s;ing Draughts,</HI> and that &s;eem to lock up the Sen&s;es to &s;oft Slumber, are hardly to be expre&s;s'd. The Mind was &s;till awake, tho' my Body &s;eeming|ly was at re&s;t; and Fancy repre&s;ented to me my hard Fortune, with redoubled Terrors.</P>
<P>I was ten Days in this langui&s;hing deplora|ble Condition, fluctuating between Death and Life, when News was brought me of my Un|cle's Arrival. Tho' I wi&s;h'd to &s;ink to the &s;ilent Grave, for the Rea&s;on I ju&s;t now men|tion'd,
<PB N="239" REF="241">
yet my Heart felt &s;ome Gleam of Plea|&s;ure, that he was come to clo&s;e my Eyes, and ble&s;s me ere I died. When my Uncle enter'd the Room where I lay, he ran to me, tender|ly embrac'd me, and wept over me. O Hea|ven, &s;aid he, is this the Joy I propos'd to my|&s;elf, in thy precious Conver&s;ation? No, my dear Boy, thou &s;halt not leave me. Forget <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> and turn thy Eyes to another Beauty I have brought with me, that loves thee for thy Virtue and thy Merit; and, if that can have any effect upon thee, &s;he is the very Pic|ture of thy lo&s;t <HI>I&s;abella.</HI> Since &s;he is now a|nother's, turn thy Eyes upon this Lady, and let her Charms cure tho&s;e Wounds the other gave. Alas! Sir, &s;aid I, Fate is not to be controll'd, and my Pa&s;&s;ion is as irrevocable. Wilt thou not live (reply'd my Uncle) to com|fort my feeble Age, who have no other Joy in Life, but thee? I have been indu&s;trious to provide this Match for thee; and, contrary to the Rules of the Sex, have prevail'd upon her to accompany me. Do not let thy hopele&s;s Pa&s;&s;ion make thee forget good Manners. Thy Slights will break her Heart. Never poor Wretch had &s;uch a Conflict in his Soul. I thought it wou'd be the highe&s;t Ingratitude, not to &s;ee a poor young Lady, that had given
<PB N="240" REF="242">
me her Heart, without &s;eeing me. After much Argument, I told my Uncle, if he pleas'd, he might bring the Lady to &s;ee what a Wretch &s;he had plac'd her unhappy Love upon, and all the Satisfaction I cou'd give her was, to ex|pire before her; for I told my Uncle, I found Death approaching.</P>
<P>He immediately went out, and return'd with my Friend, who led a Lady by the Hand. I then call'd to mind (weak as I was) he had of|ten told me of a beautiful Si&s;ter of his, that he wi&s;h'd I cou'd love, that he might make me &s;ome Recompence for the Lo&s;s he caus'd of my <HI>I&s;abella.</HI> And I, out of good Manners, &s;el|dom &s;aid any thing again&s;t it.</P>
<P>Madam, &s;aid I, your good Brother has brought you to &s;ee a Wretch, tho' young, old in Misfortunes; one who is flying to the Grave, to &s;eek a Refuge from 'em; one, who &mdash; What! interrupted the Lady, and has my dear <HI>Vaughan,</HI> in reality, forgot his <HI>I&s;abella?</HI> The Chamber having but little Light in it, I could not di&s;tingui&s;h the Fea|tures of my <HI>I&s;abella</HI>; but I knew, full well, that &s;oft Voice, who&s;e Tone was ever in my Ears. It had &s;uch an Effect upon me, that I cou'd only pronounce her dear Name, then &s;unk down &s;peechle&s;s in my Bed. It was a full
<PB N="241" REF="243">
half Hour, ere they cou'd re&s;tore me to Sen&s;e. But when I &s;aw the dear Image tenderly weep|ing over me, that I ever carry'd in my Heart, I cou'd not help crying out, Am I awake, or do I dream of &s;uch imaginary Bli&s;s? Art thou indeed my <HI>I&s;abella?</HI> Mine! really mine! and not wedded to that Wretch, who wou'd rob me of all my Soul can love in this World! I am thine (reply'd the charming <HI>I&s;abella</HI>) ever will be thine, nor ever was, or ever will be any others'. I have my Mother's, my Aunt's and thy good Uncle's Con&s;ent, to join our Hands, as well as Hearts together; and they are here to ratify what I &s;ay. Upon this, the Mother and Aunt enter'd, who tenderly em|brac'd me, calling me their dear Son, and Nephew.</P>
<P>The&s;e tender Tran&s;ports were too &s;trong for my weak Frame, and Joy was near doing what my Griefs wou'd &s;oon have done. My Speech for&s;ook me, and every one about me thought I was gone for ever. It was many Hours before I was brought to Life; and when I recover'd, I found my dear <HI>I&s;abella</HI> al|mo&s;t in the &s;ame Condition. But kind Hea|ven, that is watchful over tho&s;e that tread in the Paths of Goodne&s;s, in a few Days, reco|ver'd us to ta&s;te the Bli&s;s of happy, virtuous
<PB N="242" REF="244">
Love in our cha&s;te Conver&s;ation. It was &s;ome time before I had Lei&s;ure to enquire con|cerning my unbounded Joy; when my Friend inform'd me of it in this manner.</P>
<P>When I &s;aw you, my dear <HI>Vaughan,</HI> plung'd in Sorrow by my means, I had often Thoughts of putting an end to my wretched Life. But reflecting it wou'd be a nobler piece of Ju|&s;tice to puni&s;h the Villain that was the Cau&s;e of all our Misfortunes, I was re&s;olv'd to &s;eek him out, to take away his Life; or give up mine, to pay for the Inju&s;tice I had done you thro' his Wiles. I found a fitting Pretence to leave you, when you &s;uppos'd I was going with your Servant to <HI>London,</HI> in order to ac|quaint your good Uncle with our mi&s;erable State. But I parted with the Me&s;&s;enger the Morning we &s;et out, giving him Directions to call upon me in his Return with your Uncle, to receive Advice from me, if Fate had or|dain'd I &s;hou'd not fall in the Attempt; or, if they heard no News of me, to conclude I was no longer in this World. When I came within a few Miles of the Re&s;idence of <HI>I&s;a|bella,</HI> a violent Storm aro&s;e, which made me take Shelter in a neighbouring Village. But gue&s;s my Surprize, when I &s;aw a Coach and
<PB N="243" REF="245">
Six &s;top at the Church Door, which, by the Liveries, I knew belong'd to that vile Man, Sir <HI>Eu&s;tace,</HI> I formerly call'd Friend. The Sight, at fir&s;t, almo&s;t took away my Sen&s;es; but recollecting my &s;catter'd Rea&s;on, I &s;et my &s;elf to ob&s;erve all Pa&s;&s;ages. The Wretch came out, dre&s;s'd like a foppi&s;h Bridegroom, leading the lovely <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> trembling, pale, and wan, follow'd by the Mother and Aunt. I enquir'd of a Stander-by, if he knew that Gentleman and the Ladies? He an&s;wer'd, No; but that they came to be marry'd at their Town for more Privacy. Hope then began to revive in my Soul; for I was re&s;olv'd to put a Stop to the Wedding, or lo&s;e my Life.</P>
<P>I follow'd 'em into the Church, where, as &s;oon as Sir <HI>Eu&s;tace</HI> &s;aw me, he cry'd out, in a Tran&s;port of Joy, Fortune, I thank thee! thou ha&s;t &s;ent the only Friend I have in the World, to be Witne&s;s of my Joy. Upon that, he come forward with open Arms to em|brace me. Hold, &s;aid I, pu&s;hing him from me, I abhor all Friend&s;hip with a Villain; and kind Heaven has &s;ent me at this happy Moment, to prevent thy impo&s;ing upon this betray'd young Lady, and her Relations, thro' thy Villainy. and my mi&s;taken Folly:
<PB N="244" REF="246">
But know, the Hand of Heaven, by me, &s;hall puni&s;h thee for all thy Villainies. He &s;tood like one agha&s;t; while I had time to go up to the young Lady: Madam, &s;aid I, if you ever did love the unhappy <HI>Vaughan,</HI> love him &s;till, for he is innocent, and ever was &s;o, but betray'd by that Wretch, who is more emi|nent in Vice than Title.</P>
<P>The lovely <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> I thought, &s;eem'd to li&s;ten with an eager Tran&s;port in her Eyes, at what I declar'd. I gave her my Hand, and led her out of the Church, follow'd by the Par&s;on, who &s;eem'd in the utmo&s;t Amazement at this wonderful Proceeding! But I told him his Di&s;appointment &s;hou'd be no Lo&s;s to him, for I wou'd pay him as well, as if he had fi|ni&s;h'd the Marriage. For Heaven's &s;ake! Sir, reply'd the Par&s;on, don't imagine I am &s;uch a mercenary Wretch, to think of the Lo&s;s of what I might expect, for doing the holy Of|fice I am ordain'd to by Heaven, and my Su|periors? No, I am, I own, very much &s;ur|priz'd at &s;uch an Adventure, that never hap|pen'd to me before, or any one of my holy Function, that I ever heard of. Yet I am convinc'd there is &s;omething very extraordi|nary in your Proceeding; and I own, I think by your Appearance, and the Confu&s;ion of
<PB N="245" REF="247">
the other Gentleman, you are in the Right. I took a Di&s;ta&s;te again&s;t him the fir&s;t time I &s;aw him, when he came to me about the Li|cence. What a brave Trade you would have, Doctor (&s;aid he) if you cou'd grant a Licence to undo, what you have done this way, in your Time! Ah, how happy &s;hould we young Fellows think our&s;elves, if &s;uch a Thing cou'd be brought about! But when I repri|manded him for his ludicrous manner of &s;peaking, he cry'd, Pr'ythee, old <HI>Tackum,</HI> don't be &s;o mu&s;ty; I warrant you have had many a Wench in your Time. I own, I was &s;o very much offended with his ridiculous Je&s;ts, that I told him, the Lady he was going to marry, I fear'd, wou'd have but an indif|ferent Time with him, and if I had the Hap|pine&s;s of her Acquaintance, I &s;hou'd think it my Duty to inform her of the Poorne&s;s of his Imaginations. When he found I was a little &s;candaliz'd with his mean Notions of Marri|age, he began to excu&s;e him&s;elf, and beg my Pardon.</P>
<P>I forgot to tell you, as I led <HI>I&s;abella</HI> out of the Church, my fal&s;e Friend &s;tood like one thunder&s;truck in his Amazement. Villain! &s;aid I, as I pa&s;s'd him, if thou think'&s;t I have injur'd thee, in the Di&s;covery I &s;hall make to
<PB N="246" REF="248">
this Lady and her Relations, thou know'&s;t where I may be found in a few Days, where I will be ready to cha&s;ti&s;e thy Per&s;idy to this La|dy, and the Infamy thou ha&s;t thrown on me. He gave me no manner of An&s;wer, but let me pa&s;s on without Interruption.</P>
<P>When we came to the Par&s;on's Hou&s;e, I related (not without blu&s;hing) the ba&s;e and in|famous Contrivance between Sir <HI>Eu&s;tace</HI> and me, my Repentance, and the terrible Effects it had on you; al&s;o the Hi&s;tory of your Bro|ther and the fair <HI>Fatima,</HI> with <HI>Clerimont</HI> and his Lady, as I had learnt 'em from your own Relations. The charming <HI>I&s;abella</HI> &s;hed a Torrent of Tears at the Repetition of all your Sufferings: It was ea&s;ily &s;een, &s;he lov'd you with an unbounded Pa&s;&s;ion. The Mother and Aunt &s;eem'd as much tran&s;ported with Joy, as the fair <HI>I&s;abella.</HI> How &s;hall I puni&s;h my&s;elf, (cry'd the Fair One) for &s;o ea&s;ily believing my dear <HI>Vaughan</HI> fal&s;e! His good Uncle too, what &s;hall we &s;ay to him to excu&s;e our ill Treatment. I comforted 'em, by telling 'em, the Proofs were too artful and plain to be doubted for Truths. In &s;hort, never were any Per&s;ons elevated from di&s;mal Sorrow, to the extreme&s;t Pitch of Plea&s;ure, as the&s;e La|dies and my&s;elf were rais'd to. But that Joy
<PB N="247" REF="249">
was temper'd with Fears, when I inform'd 'em of your cruel Indi&s;po&s;ition and Sorrows. We re&s;olv'd to &s;et out as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible to the Place appointed, to meet your Uncle; and if we found him not there, immediately to repair to <HI>Monmouth</HI>; but upon Enquiry, we cou'd get no Coach to carry the Ladies; therefore a Servant was order'd to <HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s Mother's for hers.</P>
<P>While we were mingling our Tears, Hopes, Sorrows, and Joys, together, the Clark came to inform me, the Gentleman beg'd the Favour of &s;peaking one Word with me in the Church|yard. I did not doubt, but he had mu&s;ter'd up Courage enough to call for Satisfaction for his &s;uppos'd Injury. I therefore took my Sword, and maugre the Intreaties of <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> her Mother, and Aunt, went to meet him. When I came near enough to him to be heard, I told him I was ready to repair the Injuries I had done him, with my Sword, if he had Spirit enough to require it. No, Sir, &s;aid he, I have had time enough to recollect my&s;elf, and find I have been to blame in my Conduct; but notwith&s;tanding, I find Love, like Fate, is not to be controll'd; therefore I conjure you, by our former Friend&s;hip, to forget what is pa&s;t, and a&s;&s;i&s;t me hone&s;tly to gain the fair
<PB N="248" REF="250">
<HI>I&s;abella.</HI> I love her more than Life, and wou'd even part with it to gain her Heart, and your Forgivene&s;s, Hearing him talk &s;o rea&s;onably, I began to lo&s;e &s;ome part of my Re&s;entment, but yet laid before him the Impo&s;&s;ibility of his ever gaining his De&s;ires. We argued &s;ome time, and our Di&s;cour&s;e had in&s;en&s;ibly led us out of the Churchyard, along a narrow Lane that led to a Gate in the Fields, which I ob|&s;erving, was for turning back. Hold (&s;aid he) you are not to return &s;o &s;oon as you ima|gine. Upon &s;aying this, he whi&s;tled thro' his Fingers, and I was upon the In&s;tant &s;ur|rounded by &s;ix of his Footmen, who imme|diateiy &s;eiz'd and bound me. Now take that Hypocrite, and do as I order'd you. Know, thou Fool (cry'd he, looking me full in the Face) I have taken all the Time I had, before I &s;ent to thee, to think how I &s;hou'd puni&s;h thee for thy Breach of Friend&s;hip, and the Lo&s;s of <HI>I&s;abella.</HI> With that, taking a Whip from one of his Servants, he gave me &s;everal &s;e|vere La&s;hes; then &s;pitting in my Face, order'd his Footmen to tie me to the Gate, and leave me. Fury and Shame had ty'd up my Tongue, at this indignant U&s;age; therefore I cou'd not utter a Word; and if the Tears had not gu&s;h'd from my Eyes, I believe my Heart
<PB N="249" REF="251">
wou'd have bur&s;t with Pa&s;&s;ion. My Strug|gles to get loo&s;e were to no purpo&s;e, and my Strength fail'd me with my fruitle&s;s Efforts. Which the Villain perceiving, repeated his Indignities. I know you will endeavour (cry'd he) to &s;eek me out, in hopes to revenge this Affront; but be a&s;&s;ur'd, Fool, whenever thou com'&s;t in my way, expect to meet with the &s;ame Cha&s;ti&s;ement. Upon this, he and his Fellows left me, almo&s;t dead with boiling Rage. It was not long, however, that I con|tinu'd in this Condition; for <HI>I&s;abella</HI> &s;ent the Clark after me, to ob&s;erve our Motions, who on the other &s;ide of the Hedge, heard how I was us'd, but dur&s;t not appear till the Villain was gone, for fear of ta&s;ting the &s;ame bitter Cup.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I was at Liberty, I ran, with|out &s;peaking a Word, got upon my Hor&s;e, and flew after the Villain; but my Rage had &s;o blinded me, I had not put the Tongue of the Buckle of the Girt, as I &s;uppo&s;e, firm in its Place (for I got ready my Hor&s;e my&s;elf, not having Patience to wait for any one) &s;o that I came, with the Saddle between my Legs, upon the Ground, over the Crupper of my Hor&s;e, tho' without any Hurt. But it was &s;o late ere I cou'd catch him again, that I was

well a&s;&s;ur'd the Wretch had reach'd his Dwel|ling, tho' thirty Mile from the Village where I had left <HI>I&s;abella.</HI> However, I went on with my Pur&s;uit, not con&s;idering the poor Bea&s;t, till he was &s;o tir'd, I cou'd hardly get him a|long; therefore I went into a little by Ale|hou&s;e, re&s;olving to &s;tay till the Morning. I never went to Bed, for my furious Pa&s;&s;ion was too violent for Re&s;t. My Time was &s;pent in ca&s;ting about how to be reveng'd on the inju|rious Villain. At la&s;t I fix'd on this Expe|dient: I procur'd a Di&s;gui&s;e, ombred my Face, and appear'd as a Gyp&s;y. I got, the next Day, to the Villain's Ca&s;tle, which is &s;eated upon an Eminence that overlooks a Plain of two Miles round, and not one Hou&s;e but his own in that Circuit. It was a good while ere I cou'd &s;ee any of the Family; but at la&s;t a little black Boy came out, with a Bow and Arrow, to &s;hoot at a Mark he put up again&s;t a Tree; but as &s;oon as he perceiv'd me, he ran back as if in a Fright. While I was looking after him, I &s;aw the Villain meet him, who took him by the Hand, and en|courag'd him to come towards me (fir&s;t look|ing circum&s;pectly about him.) When he came to me, he cry'd, Here, you Gyp&s;y, tell this black young Devil his Fortune. No, Villain,
<PB N="251" REF="253">
I reply'd, I am come to tell thee thy For|tune; behold this injur'd Face, di&s;guis'd as it is. He knew my Voice, and was for running back, but I got between him and the Hou&s;e, drew my Sword that I had conceal'd under my Great-coat, and intercepted his Pa&s;&s;age. He &s;eeing no Hopes of e&s;caping, drew his, and, as De&s;pair makes Cowards valiant, he made &s;everal violent Thru&s;ts at me, but to no purpo&s;e, for at la&s;t I &s;ent him breathle&s;s to the Ground, with my Sword thro' his Body. As &s;oon as he fell, I flew over the Plain without being pur&s;u'd, took off my Di&s;gui&s;e, wrap|ping &s;ome Stones in it, and &s;unk it in a Pond on the Skirts of a Wood as I pa&s;s'd along, un|perceiv'd by any one. I got to the Alehou&s;e in my own Per&s;on, and that Night came back to <HI>I&s;abella</HI> and her Relations, who &s;pent the time of my Ab&s;ence in great Inquietudes. I have not let them yet into the whole Affair. Neither have I con&s;ider'd with my&s;elf, whe|ther to own the Deed or not. Pur&s;uit, I know, has been made after the Gyp&s;y, but no Enqui|ry after me. If I &s;urrender my&s;elf to the Law, I do not fear a Pardon, for the flagrant U&s;age I receiv'd from that bad Man, will plead for me. The Clark, nay, even his own Ser|vants, will be &s;ufficient Witne&s;&s;es of it. How

wou'd you advi&s;e me to proceed, my dear <HI>Vaughan?</HI> I told him, I thought it wou'd be time enough to ward again&s;t it, when he was call'd upon to an&s;wer; but it was my Opinion, he wou'd not have any farther Trou|ble about it, &s;ince he was not &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>We had &s;carce ended our Di&s;cour&s;e, when a Servant came in, very much &s;urpriz'd, and told us, there were &s;everal Officers of Ju&s;tice, with a great Crowd of People with 'em, arm'd, enquiring for my Friend, crying, they had a Warrant to apprehend him for Murder. I own, I was ra&s;h enough to advi&s;e the op|po&s;ing 'em. But he declar'd he wou'd &s;ur|render without Re&s;i&s;tance, and rely upon his Innocence and Provocation. While I was arguing the Affair with my Friend, the Offi|cers came into the Room where we were, ac|company'd by my Uncle, my Brother, and <HI>Clerimont.</HI> My Friend &s;urrendred, without the lea&s;t Shew of Re&s;i&s;tance. As I was go|ing down Stairs, to accompany him to Pri|&s;on, he &s;top'd me, begging it as a Favour I wou'd not go with him: Con&s;ider, &s;aid he, you have not recover'd your Strength, and I know your Friend&s;hip &s;o well, that it will but di&s;order you to &s;ee the Place where I am going. My Uncle join'd with him, Come,
<PB N="253" REF="255">
come, <HI>Billy,</HI> &s;aid my Uncle, the Sick mu&s;t be us'd like Old Age; you and I will &s;tay behind, and fear nothing. I have Intere&s;t e|nough in this Country to have your Friend well us'd; and I have not the lea&s;t Fear he will &s;uffer, for an Action no Man of Honour cou'd avoid. Think of the happy Moment that is now approaching. <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> my Boy, the charming <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> will be your own in a few Days. My dear Uncle, I reply'd, tho' I think every Minute an Age, till my Ange|lick <HI>I&s;abella</HI> is mine; yet, I can't think of that Happine&s;s, while my dear Friend is in Mi&s;ery. Thy Friend (reply'd my Uncle) will be free from Trouble before the Marriage-Ceremony can be fini&s;h'd. There are Wri|tings to be drawn, Settlements made, and &s;e|veral things to be in Order, before we can en|ter upon that Affair. Be&s;ides, I wou'd not come too abruptly into a Bu&s;ine&s;s that mu&s;t la&s;t for Life. You mu&s;t approach your Hap|pine&s;s by degrees.</P>
<P>My dear Uncle, I reply'd, the Thought of my coming Bli&s;s is &s;o great, that was it not qualify'd by &s;ome Fear, I cou'd not bear my Tran&s;port. I have felt the Malevolence of that blind Di&s;po&s;er, Chance, &s;o often, I mu&s;t own, I am &s;till in doubt; even when I am in

full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all my Joy, I &s;hall tremble for fear of lo&s;ing her. Sickne&s;s and Death vi&s;it the Youthful, as well as tho&s;e &s;unk in the Vale of Life; and if that grim Tyrant, who rudely thru&s;ts even to the Beds of Mo|narchs, &s;hou'd intrude with his Icy Dart to that of my divine <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> alas! with what Terrors mu&s;t I bear the remaining Hours of Life, &s;ince my Religion will not &s;uffer me to put an end to it!</P>
<P>The&s;e imaginary Ills, reply'd my Uncle, wrong thy Under&s;tanding. Wou'd you think of Shipwrack in the Port; or refu&s;e refre&s;h|ing Sleep for fear of melancholy Dreams? No, no, the World of Happine&s;s is in thy View; the lovely Pro&s;pect &s;tands before thee, free from the Storms of Fortune.</P>
<P>Whatever my good Uncle cou'd &s;ay to me on the joyful Subject, gave me but a gloomy Satisfaction. My dear Uncle did all in his Power to &s;ettle my Thoughts in Joy, and by degrees my Heart was &s;o full of it, that my Eyes o'erflow'd with Tran&s;ports, and I ap|pear'd all Air and Spirits.</P>
<P>My dear Uncle, &s;aid I, be &s;o good to re|late &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages of the unfortunate End of my good Father, and wicked Mother-in-law, that the Sorrow may alleviate this mighty Joy.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="257">My Letter, reply'd my Uncle, inform'd thee of every thing concerning that never-to-be-forgotten Cata&s;trophe.

Upon this, my Uncle took a couple of Letters out of his Pocket, and gave 'em me to read. The fir&s;t was that of my vile Mother-in-law's, as fol|lows:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear, dear <HI>Wigmore,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> HAD counterfeited Repentance &s;o well, for our pa&s;t Loves, that I almo&s;t believ'd I cou'd forget thee: But alas! that is not in my Power. Why &s;hould we not love on? Am I the only Woman in <HI>England,</HI> fal&s;e to her Husband? The Court, and the City; ay, every Town, Village, and Hamlet, in this wealthy I&s;land, have &s;ufficient Numbers to keep me in Counte|nance.</P>
<P>Nay, my Love is a Virtue, if Con&s;tancy's a Virtue; for I can love none but thee. You ever reign triumphant in my Heart, and ever &s;hall. What are the&s;e Bonds of Matrimony, that tie two People together again&s;t their Inclination, but the imaginary Line that cro&s;&s;es the Globe! 'Tis

true, we are coupled together by Law, like two Hounds in a Slip, often tugging different ways; but their Joys are unbounded when tho&s;e Couples are unbuckled that keep 'em together. But what Law does Love obey?</P>
<P>I have read &s;omewhere, it is a Law, or Cu|&s;tom &s;tronger than a Law, even in many Na|tions at this Day, That when a Man, even a Stranger, comes to &s;tay all Night in a Place, the good-natur'd Husband civilly abandons his Hou&s;e for that Night, leaving his new Gue&s;t in full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Hou&s;e and Wife, as the greate&s;t Compliment he can pay him. Oh! if that Cu&s;tom was but in u&s;e here, I &s;hou'd wi&s;h my Husband abroad for ever, and my dear <HI>Wigmore,</HI> my amiable Traveller, every Night in the Year in my Arms.</P>
<P>I need not tell thee, that the <HI>Romans</HI> were the Conquerors of the Univer&s;e, and the wi&s;e&s;t of all Nations; and yet one of their greate&s;t Orators lent his Wife to his Friend, and receiv'd her again to his Bo&s;om, without any Stain to Virtue. However, I have &s;ome Hopes my Hou&s;hold-Plague is upon his Journey to Hea|ven, for he has been long ling'ring with a hap|py Illne&s;s.

<P>I'll meet you this Evening in the Summer-Hou&s;e, and let you in my&s;elf. I have provided you a Key of the Back-Garden Gate, that after to-night, you may take all Opportunities of &s;ee|ing me, without Danger of being di&s;cover'd: Our Gardener is turn'd away, thro' my means, who, I thought, began to be a little too ob&s;erv|ing. My Husband's Illne&s;s (Cur&s;e on that Name!) will prevent his coming into that Part of the Garden; and I &s;hall take care of every body el&s;e, by locking the Door after me.</P>

<P>The&s;e two Letters, &s;aid my Uncle, when I fir&s;t met with 'em, gave me infinite Pain, when I con&s;ider'd, our Credulity in tru&s;ting that vile wicked Woman, had drawn this fa|tal Sorrow on our Heads.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="263">I thought it Wi&s;dom to conceal this Tra|gical Story from the World; therefore gave it out, thy worthy Father dy'd a natural Death, his long Indi&s;po&s;ition giving it Credit. But there was no concealing the End of that mi&s;er|able Woman; therefore, to &s;creen her Igno|miny, we reported &s;he had given her Son <HI>Johnny,</HI> by mi&s;take, Phy&s;ic &s;o &s;trong, that had purg'd him into another World. This, with the Lo&s;s of her Husband, we gave out, had turn'd her Brain, &s;o that &s;he was forc'd to be &s;ecur'd in her Clo&s;et; but in endeavour|ing to get out of the Window, met her Fate. Tho' many, I fear, judg'd the true Cau&s;e of her Death.</P>
<P>But now, my dear Child, turn thy Thoughts from every melancholy Subject, and look up|on the lovely <HI>I&s;abella</HI> (who was then entring the Chamber) who &s;hortly &s;hall be thine. I was ever his, reply'd the Charmer of my Soul; and if I had wedded that ridiculous Wretch, who&s;e End has brought us into &s;ome Trou|ble, it was only out of an ob&s;tinate Revenge for your &s;uppos'd Fal&s;hood; but that Re|venge wou'd have fallen upon my&s;elf, for Death wou'd in a few Days have ended my Mi&s;eries.</P>

I read the fatal Letter a thou&s;and times over, examin'd well the Hand, and tho' the Direction was not in the &s;ame Character, I found the Seal and the Let|ter were yours.</P>
<P>Nothing gave me greater Proof of your Infidelity, than your Silence. I wou'd often cry, <HI>Ungrateful Man, ha&s;t thou then for&s;aken me!</HI> I even &s;tudy'd Means to excu&s;e you, but cou'd not find one. No, I cou'd not find the lea&s;t Glimp&s;e to hope the contrary.</P>
<P>I di&s;cover'd to my Mother and Aunt the Progre&s;s of our young Amours, who&s;e Good|ne&s;s never rebuk'd me for my Weakne&s;s, but thought as I did, that you were fal&s;e.

<P>With much Per&s;ua&s;ion of your Rival, and my Friends, I fix'd the Day of our Nup|tials; and, to &s;ay the Truth, his Behaviour
<PB N="263" REF="265">
was much mended, he &s;eem'd to wear a more &s;olid Air, and expre&s;s'd his Love with &s;o &s;in|cere a Freedom, that I often wi&s;h'd I cou'd give him that Heart you held &s;o fa&s;t.</P>
<P>The Night before the Morning intended for my Nuptials, was &s;pent in the utmo&s;t Grief of Heart; and when my Mother and Aunt came in the Morning, to dre&s;s me for the Solemnity, I had not Strength to ri&s;e without Help. I was &s;eiz'd with a violent Fever, which confin'd me to my Bed for near three Months. The intended Bridegroom &s;pent his whole Time at my Chamber-Door, and appear'd incon&s;olable. I mu&s;t own to you, I began (from his Behaviour) to give him &s;ome part of my E&s;teem; but my Heart was not in my Power to give him, tho' I often wi&s;h'd it had. I thought it was a mo&s;t unbe|coming Weakne&s;s, to lament one who paid my Sufferings with Di&s;dain. Therefore, once more the Day was fix'd; and if all-judging Heaven had not &s;ent your Friend that very Moment, what but my Death mu&s;t have follow'd, when I had under&s;tood that my dear <HI>Vaughan</HI> was innocent?</P>
<P>O Heavens! I reply'd, the very Thought fills me with the utmo&s;t Agony. Well, well, reply'd my Uncle, when you are once wedded,
<PB N="264" REF="266">
you'll begin to talk like your rea&s;onable Peo|ple; at pre&s;ent, your Sen&s;es are in a Hurry, and every Faculty bewilder'd in a Maze of I don't know what. But Time and Marriage will re&s;tore you to your Under&s;tandings.</P>
<P>We were interrupted by my Man's telling me Mrs. <HI>Betty</HI> was arriv'd, and beg'd to &s;ee me. When &s;he came in, &s;he look'd wi&s;tful|ly upon me, and bur&s;t into Tears. What, <HI>Betty,</HI> &s;aid I, are you griev'd to &s;ee me a|gain? She cou'd not utter one Word, but ran up to me, took me about the Neck, and almo&s;t drowned me with Weeping. The poor Creature's Love fill'd my Heart with a grateful Tenderne&s;s. When &s;he had found the U&s;e of her Tongue, &s;he cry'd, O my dear Ma&s;ter, the Sight of you gives me more Plea&s;ure than ever I did feel, or can feel. I have not known one Moment's Joy &s;ince your Ab&s;ence. She &s;aid &s;o many kind things, that I cou'd not refrain ki&s;&s;ing her tenderly.</P>
<P>My dear <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> &s;aid I, you mu&s;t allow Mrs. <HI>Betty</HI> &s;ome &s;mall Share in my Heart with you, who&s;e faithful Friend&s;hip, tho' a Servant, I &s;hall never forget, and will make it my future Study to recompen&s;e her uncom|mon Fidelity. That, Sir, reply'd my Uncle, &s;hall be my Care; one Woman is enough
<PB N="265" REF="267">
for one Man to take care of. You are in the right, reply'd the divine <HI>I&s;abella.</HI> But, now I think on't, I have left <HI>Fatima,</HI> and <HI>Eliza,</HI> prepa|ring to follow your Brother and <HI>Clerimont</HI> to the Pri&s;on, and I came to you, my dear <HI>Vaughan,</HI> to lay my Commands upon you to &s;tay with your Uncle till our Return. My Uncle, my&s;elf, and <HI>Betty,</HI> were uttering the Fulne&s;s of our Hearts, with the utmo&s;t Con|tentment; when a Per&s;on that belong'd to the Inn, came running up Stairs in the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion, For Heaven's &s;ake, Sir, &s;aid he, run into the Garden, and lend your A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance to a Lady that &s;ome Villains are hurry|ing away into a Boat, again&s;t her Will.</P>
<P>My Uncle and I ran down upon the In|&s;tant, with our Swords in our Hands; but, O Heavens! what was my Terror and Sur+prize, when I di&s;cover'd my dear <HI>I&s;abella</HI> in a Boat, held by Force in the Arms of a Per|&s;on, a Stranger to me, and &s;ix Men rowing down the Stream with their utmo&s;t Force. The unexpected Sight took away my Sen&s;es, and had I not lean'd my Back again&s;t a Tree, I mu&s;t have fallen to the Ground.</P>
<P>There was a &s;mall Boat, at the Landing-place in the Garden, which (when I could recover my Strength) I got into &s;o &s;uddenly,
<PB N="266" REF="268">
that my Uncle cou'd not prevent me. When I had pu&s;h'd it off with my Foot, I found, too late, I had neither Oar nor Pole to ma|nage her, &s;o that &s;he drove down the Stream, without my being able to &s;top her.</P>
<P>My Fury and Impatience almo&s;t took away my Sen&s;es. The Boat drove for two Hours before it &s;topt again&s;t a Bank, and then it was &s;o dark, when I got out of it, I cou'd not &s;ee my way. I thought it to no purpo&s;e to put off the Boat again; and, notwith&s;tanding my Impatience, I was forc'd to grope about to find &s;ome Path, but all to no purpo&s;e; therefore I was wandering about till Day-light, and then had the Misfortune to find I was got upon a little I&s;land in the River <HI>Wye.</HI> I then endeavour'd to find the Boat again, but all to no Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I was now plung'd into the utmo&s;t De&s;pair. A thou&s;and times I form'd Re&s;olutions fatal to my Life. I accus'd Heaven, Fortune, and unlucky Stars. I cou'd not help &s;aying to my &s;elf, What Sins have I committed, that my Puni&s;hment in this World mu&s;t be beyond Hu|man Nature to bear! How happy did I think my&s;elf (after all my Misfortunes) but twelve Hours ago! Cou'd mortal Man ima|gine, after running thro' &s;o many various

Scenes of unfortunate Incidents, and then to have the Cure of all my Sorrows within my reach, to have her &s;natch'd from me in my own native Soil, a Country fam'd for her whol&s;ome Laws, by a Stranger? for I own, I cou'd not remember I had ever ob&s;erv'd the Face of the villainous Ravi&s;her. I &s;ometimes imagin'd it was all a Dream; but, to my cru|el Grief, I was too well a&s;&s;ur'd I was a|wake.</P>
<P>I waited till the Sun had made a full three Hours Cour&s;e, upon the I&s;land, in hope my Uncle, and my Friends, wou'd find &s;ome means of following me, but to no purpo&s;e. I cou'd hear People talk upon the Shore, be|hind the Willows, but when I call'd to 'em for their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, cou'd get no An&s;wer. My Mind was &s;o di&s;turb'd, that my Rea&s;on &s;eem'd to fly me; and my Spirits were &s;o low and faint, that I had not Strength to walk. However, I took the Re&s;olution of plunging into the Water, to &s;wim to the oppo&s;ite Shore; but the Weight of my Cloaths, the Rapidity of the Stream, and my Weakne&s;s, hurry'd me to the Bottom; and if I had not been a&s;|&s;i&s;ted by two Fi&s;hermen, who were mending their Nets on the Shore, and &s;aw me throw my&s;elf into the Water, I mu&s;t have inevita|bly

peri&s;h'd. They drew me into their Boat (depriv'd of Sen&s;e for &s;ome time) and carry'd me to their Cottage, &s;trip'd me of my wet Cloaths, and put me to Bed. When I came to my&s;elf, I bewail'd my Misfortunes in &s;uch a manner, that the Fi&s;hermen imagin'd I had thrown my&s;elf into the River, to put an end to 'em. Upon that Suppo&s;ition, they began to comfort me, and inquir'd into the Cau&s;e of my Sorrows. But when I had inform'd 'em, one of 'em cry'd out to the other, As &s;ure as can be, the Woman we heard la&s;t Night cal|ling for Help! was the very Per&s;on this Gen|tleman is in que&s;t of.</P>
<P>They told me, about an Hour after Day was &s;hut in, la&s;t Night, they heard a Lady cry violently, and a Man comforting her; but the Boatmen row'd &s;o fa&s;t down the Stream, they were &s;oon out of Hearing. This Know|ledge rous'd up my Spirits, and the Thoughts of Vengeance gave me new Strength. I got my Cloaths dry'd with the utmo&s;t Expedition, and dre&s;s'd my&s;elf; but inquiring after my Hat and Sword, they reply'd, they knew no|thing of them. I did not doubt, but I had lo&s;t 'em when I was in the Water, yet was di&s;tre&s;s'd how to get more. The Fi&s;hermen offer'd to carry me in their Boat to <HI>Chep|&s;tow,</HI>
<PB N="269" REF="271">
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Chep&s;tow</HI> in <HI>Monmouth&s;hire,</HI> a Market-Town, &s;eat|ed upon the River <HI>Wye,</HI> very near where that River falls into the <HI>Severn,</HI> with a large wooden Bridge over it. There is a natural Fortification of Rocks and Moun|tains, tho' it has been formerly fortify'd. There is &s;till the Remains of an old Ca&s;tle, built by <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> (as the Inhabitants will have it.) The Tide flows here fourteen Yards high.</NOTE>, where I might accommodate my&s;elf. I accepted of their Offer, and we got into their Boat upon the In&s;tant. However, I bor|row'd a Hat of one of 'em, and an old Pair of Hor&s;e-Pi&s;tols, the only Arms that belong'd to them. The Boat was a very old &s;luggi&s;h one, that did not an&s;wer my impatient De&s;ire of getting to the Town, and it was with much Per&s;ua&s;ion I did not go on Shore to walk. They told me, about a Mile farther, there was a little Creek, where I might land, and walk to <HI>Chep&s;tow</HI> &s;ooner than the Boat cou'd get there. When we came into the Creek, we perceiv'd a Boat, with a Man a&s;leep in't, and I &s;trongly imagin'd it was the very Boat that the Ravi&s;her had row'd away in, with my dear <HI>I&s;abella.</HI> My Blood, at that Thought, thrill'd thro' my Veins, and I was ju&s;t ready to &s;hoot the poor Wretch, as he lay a&s;leep in the Boat.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="272">I order'd my two Fi&s;hermen to row up clo&s;e to the other Boat; but the Noi&s;e of our Oars awak'd the Man, who &s;tarted up to look at us.

The Man was &s;o &s;car'd at my manner of Proceed|ing, that he was ready to die with Apprehen|&s;ion. Villain! &s;aid I, if thou do&s;t not this Moment declare where thy vile Ma&s;ter has carry'd the young Lady he took away by Force Ye&s;terday, this Moment is thy la&s;t.

<P>Sir <HI>Eu&s;tace</HI> landed at this Place, late la&s;t Night, with the Lady and his Servants. My Ma&s;ter, the Owner of this Boat, attended him, telling me he wou'd return by Break of Day this Morning, and ordering me to take care of the Boat in the mean time.

<PB N="272" REF="274">
of that infamous Traitor, Sir <HI>Eu&s;tace.</HI> My two Fi&s;hermen, and he, &s;eem'd thunder|&s;truck at the Relation.

But when I in|form'd 'em my Uncle (naming his Name) had as many powerful Friends in that Coun|try, as he had; one of the Men cry'd, What, Sir, are you the Nephew to that worthy Gentleman? When I an&s;wer'd in the Affir|mative, he told me, he wou'd run the Ha|zard of his Life to &s;erve me, upon his Ac|count; nay, and an&s;wer for his Companion: We owe both our Lives to him. Notwith|&s;tanding my own unhappy Condition, I cou'd not refrain asking the Man, which way my Uncle had been &s;o &s;erviceable to them?</P>
<P>Sir, reply'd the Man, my Companion and I were taken up for a Murder and Robbery, and tho' innocent as your&s;elf, yet the Jury found us Guilty: Nay, we mu&s;t own, the Appearances were &s;trong again&s;t us. I'll give your Honour the Story in as few Words as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="275">About three Quarters of a Year ago, as my Partner and I were fi&s;hing in this River, we perceiv'd a Hat floating down the Stream, which we took up. We waited &s;ome Hours, imagining &s;ome Body wou'd come to claim it; but no one appearing, my Partner gave me half a Crown for my Share, being in more want of a Hat than my&s;elf. He wore it ge|nerally Sundays and Holidays, without any one claiming it. About the Time we found the Hat, a young Fellow frequented a by Ale|hou&s;e in the Neighbourhood, for two or three Days, where my Companion and I us'd often to drink. One Day, while we were there, he offer'd to pawn a gold Medal to the Land|lord of the Hou&s;e; he not having Money e|nough to &s;pare, came to me, and de&s;ired I wou'd lend him three Guineas upon it, the Medal weighing, at lea&s;t, five Guineas: I made no Scruple, but let the young Man have the Money, with this Agreement, that if he did not redeem it in a Fortnight, I wou'd di&s;po&s;e of it, for I told him, I cou'd not be out of my Money for a longer Time. He con&s;ented, and the next Evening di&s;appear'd of a &s;udden.</P>
<P>The following Day, as we were drawing our Nets, we perceiv'd &s;omething very heavy;
<PB N="274" REF="276">
but we were very much &s;urpris'd, when drag|ging it a&s;hore, to find a murder'd Body in it, with &s;everal Wounds upon the Head, in a light-colour'd Suit of Cloaths, trim'd with a &s;mall Silver Edging. We acquainted the Country with it, and the next Day it was own'd to be an old Lady's Son, who had been mi&s;&s;ing &s;ome time. The Corps was bury'd by the &s;orrowful Mother, and no Enquiry cou'd find out the Murderer.</P>
<P>A few Days after this, the <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> Holidays came on, and my Partner and I went to &s;ee &s;ome Friends at <HI>Monmouth</HI>; but my chief Rea&s;on of going, was to di&s;po&s;e of my gold Medal. My Companion went to have his Hat done &s;omething to; while I went to a Gold&s;mith's to di&s;po&s;e of my Medal. When I offer'd it to the Man of the Shop, he exa|min'd it very narrowly, then looking me wi&s;t|fully in the Face, ask'd me, how I came by it? When I had inform'd him, he reply'd, Very well, I'll carry it to a Per&s;on in the Neighbourhood, that perhaps will give more than the Weight of it. I &s;eem'd very well &s;atisfy'd.</P>
<P>The Gold&s;mith went out, but return'd in a Quarter of an Hour, with the Con&s;table and &s;everal A&s;&s;i&s;tants, and, in &s;hort, charg'd
<PB N="275" REF="277">
me with the Murder and Robbery of the Widow's Son. I was in&s;tantly carry'd before a Ju&s;tice, and examin'd; and before my Ex|amination was over, my Partner was brought in by the Hatter, who &s;wore, the Hat he brought to him, he &s;old to the young unfor|tunate Gentleman that was murder'd. The&s;e Circum&s;tances meeting thus together, it was agreed on all Hands, that we were guilty of the Murder; and what confirm'd People's Opinion was, that the Landlord of the Ale|hou&s;e, where I had the Medal, deny'd the Fact.</P>
<P>Upon this, we gave up our&s;elves for lo&s;t. I having &s;ome &s;mall Share of Education, drew up our Ca&s;e, to be pre&s;ented to the Judges, but it did us no good, for we were condemn'd to die, for the Guilt of another Per&s;on.</P>
<P>Your good Uncle was at the Trial by Ac|cident, and whether by our Countenance, or &s;ome Proceedings in our Trial, I can't tell, but he &s;eem'd to think us innocent. He exa|min'd us &s;trictly about the young Man I had the Medal from, as to his Age, Shape, Size, and what Dre&s;s he wore. When he had done that, he left us, de&s;iring us to recommend our &s;elves to Heaven, tho' he own'd, he thought
<PB N="276" REF="278">
we dy'd for an Act we had never commit|ted.</P>
<P>We prepar'd our&s;elves for Death, not hav|ing the lea&s;t Hopes of Life. The Morning that was intended for our Execution, your good Uncle enter'd our Room in the Pri&s;on, fir&s;t preparing, by degrees, our Spirits, to re|ceive the unlook'd-for Change in our Condi|tion. He inform'd us, we were at our Liber|ty, and brought a Surgeon with him, whom he order'd to let us both Blood.</P>
<P>I was (&s;aid your Uncle) convinc'd of your Innocency; but what made me more a&s;&s;ur'd of it, was, that I had &s;een a young Fellow taken up at <HI>Hereford,</HI> where I had &s;ome Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, for offering to &s;ell a gold Watch, that he cou'd give but a &s;lender Account how he came by it. I came into the Court at <HI>Mon|mouth,</HI> ju&s;t as your Trial came on. After you were found Guilty, I inform'd the Judges of my Su&s;picions, and I thought it the Du|ty of every Gentleman to u&s;e his Endeavour to clear the Innocent. I immediately return'd to <HI>Hereford</HI> (after enquiring of you all the Circum&s;tances of your Defence) and dealt with the Pri&s;oner &s;o effectually, that he con|fe&s;s'd every thing. He inform'd me, that he had been long a Companion to the Wi|dow's
<PB N="277" REF="279">
Son, and both living a di&s;orderly Life, he prevail'd upon him to rob his Mother of a Sum of Money, and imbark for the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI>; but the Devil put it into his Mind to murder him, which he did, by fir&s;t &s;tabbing him with a pointed Hanger; and after cut|ting him over the Head with the &s;ame Wea|pon, for fear his Groans might be overheard by &s;omebody by Accident, he took from him a Pur&s;e of &s;ixty-four Guineas, the fatal Me|dal, a Diamond Ring, and the gold Watch he was taken up for, in endeavouring to &s;ell it at <HI>Hereford.</HI> The poor Wretch was a&s;&s;ur'd that Heaven wou'd not let Murder be hid; for, as he intended for <HI>Ireland,</HI> he might have di&s;pos'd of both Medal and Watch with Safe|ty there. But he knew the Devil infatuated his Mind.</P>
<P>Your good Uncle (continu'd the Fi&s;her|man) made him &s;ign his Confe&s;&s;ion; and he took &s;uch farther Mea&s;ures with the Judges, that he procur'd our Liberty; and not only that, but made a Gathering for us among the Gentlemen of the Country, that amount|ed (with his own Bounty) to an hundred and thirty five Pounds.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, &s;ince you are Nephew to that noble Gentleman to whom we owe our Lives
<PB N="278" REF="280">
and Fortunes, command us what you plea&s;e, as far as Hone&s;ty and our Power may carry us, and we will in&s;tantly obey you.</P>
<P>While the Fi&s;herman was relating this &s;hort Story, his Companion &s;py'd a Hat floating again&s;t the Bank of the Creek, which I knew to be my own, but both the Men were &s;o very much &s;tartled at the Sight of it, that neither of 'em wou'd take it up. How|ever, I got the young Fellow in the other Boat, who was not &s;o &s;crupulous, to get it for me, who, under&s;tanding the villainous Treatment I had receiv'd from the Wretch that hir'd the Boat of his Ma&s;ter, was re&s;olv'd to join with the other two.</P>
<P>While we were con&s;ulting how to proceed, the Owner of the Boat came down to the Creek. My Blood ro&s;e at the Man, tho' I knew he had been impos'd upon by that ba&s;e Villain, Sir <HI>Eu&s;tace.</HI> However, I re&s;olv'd to be &s;ilent, in hope I &s;hou'd learn &s;omething from him. As &s;oon as he came near enough, his Man ask'd him, how he could leave him all Night in &s;uch a Place, without Victuals, Drink, or Re&s;t? Z&mdash;ds! reply'd the Man, you have had more Re&s;t than I, I dare &s;wear. Never was poor Wretch &s;o ill us'd, as I have been. When I came within a Quarter of a
<PB N="279" REF="281">
Mile of <HI>Chep&s;tow,</HI> the Villain order'd his Servants to bind my Hands and Feet, and throw me into a Ditch, which, by good For|tune, prov'd a dry one. The Rea&s;on why, my Friend (cry'd the Brute) I part with your good Company, is, becau&s;e I wou'd not have you know where I intend to lie to|night; perhaps, in a little Time, I &s;hall find &s;ome Method of &s;atisfying you for the Trouble you have been at, upon my account. And &s;o, Friend, I wi&s;h you a good Night's Re&s;t!</P>
<P>Upon &s;aying this, he, and his wicked Crew, walk'd away, although I begg'd to be releas'd, promi&s;ing I would return to my Boat, without following them. But he re|ply'd, No, no! that is one Rea&s;on why I would have you lie there all Night.</P>
<P>Pray Friend, &s;aid I, in what Condition was the poor young Lady, that he forcibly carry'd away? Why truly, Sir, reply'd the Man, I can't well tell, for &s;he had mourn'd &s;o much in the Boat, that when we landed, &s;he did not utter a Word, but &s;uffer'd her|&s;elf to be led by her Husband, without any Re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>I &s;oon undeceiv'd him in that Particular, by acquainting him with the Truth of the
<PB N="280" REF="282">
&s;orrowful Affair. And is it &s;o? reply'd the Ma&s;ter of the Boat. If I had known that, no Recompence, or Threats, &s;hould have prevail'd upon me to have lent him any A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance in &s;uch a ba&s;e Action.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort Con&s;ultation, I re&s;olv'd with the Ma&s;ter of the Boat, to go by Land to <HI>Chep&s;tow,</HI> while the two Fi&s;hermen, and the other Man, carry'd the Boats there.</P>
<P>Accordingly, we parted: But as &s;oon as we enter'd the Town, the fir&s;t Per&s;ons I &s;aw were, my dear Uncle, my Brother, my Friend, and <HI>Clerimont,</HI> with four Servants, all well arm'd, in &s;earch after the Ravi&s;her and me. They hir'd a Boat at <HI>Monmouth,</HI> with all the Expedition imaginable, thinking to overtake me at lea&s;t, and, as we all &s;up|pos'd, mi&s;t me when the Boat I was in, fell in with the little I&s;land, where I remain'd all Night. They were going, when we met 'em, down to the Creek, to endeavour the finding the Man that was bound, and thrown into the Ditch, being inform'd of it by the very Per&s;on that had releas'd him in the Morning.</P>
<P>We came to a Re&s;olution of &s;eparating: My Brother and I, with two Servants, to get Hor&s;es and go into <HI>Wales,</HI> in pur&s;uit of
<PB N="281" REF="283">
them; my Uncle, my Friend, and the other two Servants, to follow by Water; my Go|vernor to &s;tay at <HI>Chep&s;tow,</HI> or <HI>Monmouth,</HI> ju&s;t as he thought convenient.</P>
<P>My Brother and I, with two Servants, &s;et out well arm'd for our Purpo&s;e, without ta|king any formal Leave of my Uncle and the re&s;t; for I was too much concern'd, to mind Ceremony. As we pa&s;s'd the Mountains that environ <HI>Chep&s;tow,</HI> the Hor&s;e of one of my Uncle's Servants fell down-right lame, which gave me &s;ome little Unea&s;ine&s;s. But the Fellow being Running-Footman to the la&s;t Ma&s;ter he &s;erv'd, told us, he would be at the next Town before us, and provide him&s;elf another Hor&s;e. Accordingly he left the lame one at a Cottage in the Road, and flew away as &s;wift as a Greyhound. The Roads were &s;o bad for our Hor&s;es, that he was &s;oon out of Sight. After riding about four Miles, we came to a &s;mall Inn, where I was &s;urpriz'd to find him drinking with a Footman at the Door. As &s;oon as we came near enough for him to be heard, he call'd out to me, Sir, for a &s;mall matter, I can have a Hor&s;e of this Man, who is a Servant to Sir <HI>Eu&s;tace</HI>; and as we are to go within a Mile of his Ma&s;ter's Hou&s;e, I am to leave
<PB N="282" REF="284">
the Hor&s;e at a Place where he has appointed, his Bu&s;ine&s;s not being urgent, he &s;ays he will walk the re&s;t of the Way.</P>
<P>The Name of that Villain, Sir <HI>Eu&s;tace,</HI> and the manner of the Servant's &s;peaking to me, convinc'd me there was &s;omething to be under&s;tood by it. I therefore endeavour'd to compo&s;e my&s;elf from the Ruffle the Villain's Name had caus'd in my Soul. I &s;oon ob|&s;erv'd the Fellow was very much gone in Li|quor, therefore was in &s;ome Hope of learn|ing which way my dear <HI>I&s;abella</HI> was forc'd. He did not &s;eem to have any Notion of us, or our Bu&s;ine&s;s, therefore I told him, I in|tended to make a Vi&s;it to his Ma&s;ter at my Return. Hark ye, Sir, reply'd the Fellow, to tell you the Truth, if you do, you'll lo&s;e your Labour, for my Ma&s;ter is not at home at pre&s;ent, neither can I tell you when he will be at home. Nor does he much care, inter|rupted my Uncle's Man, for I find his Ma&s;ter and he don't &s;et their Hor&s;es toge|ther.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t own I did tell you &s;o, return'd the Man, but you are to blame to let all the World know it. There's no Harm done, I reply'd; he knows I want a Servant; there|fore, if you intend to leave Sir <HI>Eu&s;tace,</HI> and
<PB N="283" REF="285">
he'll give you a Character, I'll take you in|to my Service. A Character, Sir! (cry'd the Man, ha&s;tily) I am afraid his Character will be but &s;mall Encouragement for me to get another Ma&s;ter. I mu&s;t conceal, if po&s;|&s;ible, my ever living with him. Sir, I mu&s;t beg your Pardon, when I tell you (as one of my Ma&s;ters Acquaintance) he is &s;o wicked a Man, that I think no one, that is not as wicked as him&s;elf, would live with him.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I &s;oon found the Fellow was too hone&s;t in his Principles, for &s;o impious a Ma&s;ter. And yet, one wou'd think (conti|nu'd the Servant) he &s;hou'd take Warning. It is not above &s;ix Weeks ago, when a Gen|tleman he had ill us'd, in Di&s;gui&s;e, run him through the Body. We all thought he wou'd have breath'd his la&s;t; but he recover'd in le&s;s than a Month, the Wound not being through any Mortal Part. He order'd his Servants and the Surgeon to conceal his Re|covery from the Country: But we were &s;oon let into the Meaning of it; for he went di&s;|guis'd, two Days ago, to <HI>Monmouth,</HI> under Pretence to take up the Gentleman for his &s;uppo&s;ed Murder; but it was only to take his Opportunity of running away with a young Lady, whom he &s;ays he's contracted
<PB N="284" REF="286">
to; which he did, and is now gone to <HI>Bri|&s;tol,</HI> for more Secrecy and Security, where he intends to force the Lady to marry him, or perhaps wor&s;e.</P>
<P>I was &s;o much di&s;order'd with what the Man &s;aid to me, my Pa&s;&s;ion overcoming my Rea&s;on, that I declar'd aloud, I wou'd be the Death of him. The poor Fellow began to &s;u&s;pect &s;omething; and the Apprehen&s;ion of &s;ome Ill U&s;age threw him into &s;uch a Fit of Trembling, that he &s;oon became &s;ober. He begg'd for Heaven's &s;ake, he might not &s;uffer for the Evil Deeds of his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>No, my Friend, &s;aid I, I have &s;ome Re|gard for thee, for thy Hone&s;ty, becau&s;e I think, by thy Di&s;cour&s;e, thou do&s;t not ap|prove the wicked De&s;igns of that ba&s;e Vil|lain. Therefore, if thou wilt receive me for thy Ma&s;ter, be a&s;&s;ur'd it is in my Na|ture to u&s;e every one well, that has any De|pendance upon me.</P>
<P>Sir, reply'd the young Fellow, you &s;eem &s;o far different in your Behaviour from my pre&s;ent Ma&s;ter, that I &s;hall think my&s;elf got out of Purgatory into Paradi&s;e. We &s;oon made an Agreement, to the Satisfaction of us both.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="287">He then inform'd me, his Ma&s;ter had di&s;|patch'd him to his Ca&s;tle in <HI>Wales,</HI> for &s;eve|ral Nece&s;&s;aries for him&s;elf, and the Servants that were gone with him to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> which were privately to be brought in a Waggon; for he apprehended it was not &s;afe to bring the Lady home immediately, not doubting, in the lea&s;t, but the Gentleman that wound|ed him before, wou'd pur&s;ue him, with the Company he had &s;o much exa&s;perated by his villainous Proceeding.</P>
<P>Upon the Knowledge of this, we return'd back to <HI>Chep&s;tow,</HI> in order to get to <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> with the utmo&s;t Expedition. When we came back to <HI>Chep&s;tow,</HI> we were inform'd, my Un|cle, with his Party, had hir'd a Ve&s;&s;el to go for <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> which made us imagine he had gain'd &s;ome Knowledge of the Place where they were gone.</P>
<P>We only &s;taid to give our Hor&s;es &s;ome &s;mall Refre&s;hment, and &s;et forward by Land for <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI>; tho' we were two Hours ferry|ing over.</P>
<P>When we arriv'd at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> my new Ser|vant told me, his old Ma&s;ter was at Captain &mdash; in <HI>Radcliff</HI> Street, over-again&s;t the Church. My Brother and I di&s;|guis'd our&s;elves in our Servants Cloaths, and
<PB N="286" REF="288">
went to the Hou&s;e where we were inform'd Sir <HI>Eu&s;tace</HI> and my dear <HI>I&s;abella</HI> were. The Door was &s;hut &s;ome time; but after half an Hour's waiting, we &s;aw the Villain coming out with a Gentleman, that we &s;uppos'd to be the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e. My Blood flew with &s;uch Violence thro' my Veins, that it was with much Per&s;ua&s;ion of my Bro|ther, I had not &s;hot the Villain through the Head. But he advis'd me to u&s;e Strata|gem.</P>
<P>Let us, &s;aid he, &s;end for your new Ser|vant, and by the time he comes, we'll think of &s;omething to compa&s;s our Ends, without Blood&s;hed. When the Servant came, we in&s;tructed him to go to the Lady, as from his Ma&s;ter, and with a Ring as a Token for his Pa&s;&s;port, which I gave him, which was my dear <HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s, I did not doubt but &s;he would know it again, and come more wil|lingly.</P>
<P>My new Man did his Bu&s;ine&s;s dexterou&s;|ly. He found the Chamber of <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> guarded by two of his old Fellow-Servants, who made no Scruple of letting him pa&s;s, when he acquainted them he had Orders to conduct the Lady to his Ma&s;ter, in order to be marry'd that Night.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="289">When he came into the Room, where the divine <HI>I&s;abella</HI> was lamenting her Condition in Tears and Sighs, upon the Floor, he, without Ceremony, gave her the Ring, tel|ling her, the Owner of it waited for her in the Street; if &s;he cou'd give Credit to that Pa&s;&s;port, &s;he might be in the Arms of her devoted Husband in a few Minutes. She look'd upon the Ring &s;ome time, with the utmo&s;t Tran&s;port of Joy (as the Man told us afterwards) and at la&s;t &s;aid, Though my terrible Misfortunes make me &s;u&s;pect every thing, and every Per&s;on, yet, whatever Hands I fall into, I can't fear wor&s;e U&s;age than from tho&s;e I have the Misfortune to be in at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>She then gave my new Servant her Hand, who led her down Stairs, telling the two Cen|tries at the Door, to order a hand&s;ome Supper, for their Ma&s;ter wou'd be back in le&s;s than an Hour.</P>
<P>When we perceiv'd him coming with the divine <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> I trembled &s;o much, I had not Power to &s;tand; but my Brother, fear|ing my Tran&s;ports might di&s;cover us, led me &s;ome di&s;tance from the Hou&s;e. But when my lovely <HI>I&s;abella</HI> came up to me, nei|ther of us cou'd utter a Word. My Brother
<PB N="288" REF="290">
wou'd not let us &s;tay to open our Hearts, but took hold of my dear <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> and hurry'd her along, while I follow'd, not knowing what I was doing.</P>
<P>As we were cro&s;&s;ing the Bridge, we met my Uncle and his Party, they not expecting to meet us. By the Light of the Shops upon the Bridge, knowing <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> they drew their Swords; and had not my Brother di&s;|cover'd him&s;elf that In&s;tant, &s;ome of my Friends had probably lo&s;t their Lives; for, in the Heat of my Fury, I mi&s;took them, as they did us, and drew my Pi&s;tols; but the fir&s;t fla&s;hing in the Pan, prevented my doing an Action that I &s;hould have for ever re|pented.</P>
<P>We had not time to congratulate each other, upon our unexpected meeting; but my Un|cle and Friends, finding we had regain'd <HI>I&s;a|bella,</HI> led us back to the Boat they came in, and, notwith&s;tanding the Darkne&s;s of the Night, we &s;et out from <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> &s;o eagerly, that we forgot my Uncle's two Servants at the Inn, who were found watching about the Hou&s;e where <HI>I&s;abella</HI> was confin'd by Sir <HI>Eu&s;tace,</HI> who, by Threats, got out of them, who they belong'd to. A Fellow that &s;aw our Rencounter upon the Bridge, had follow'd
<PB N="289" REF="291">
us to the Boat, and hearing Sir <HI>Eu&s;tace</HI> threat|ning my Uncle's Servants, declar'd what he knew concerning us.</P>
<P>Upon this, he got his Men together, took a Boat, and follow'd us with &s;uch Impreca|tions, that the two Servants of my Uncle's were &s;o frighted for my Safety, not know|ing their Ma&s;ter was with me, that they got a Guide to conduct them along the Water|&s;ide, to give us Notice of our approaching Danger, as they told us afterwards.</P>
<P>While we were in the Boat, my dear <HI>I&s;a|bella</HI> and I, mingled our Tears of Joy toge|ther. She told me when the hated Villain fir&s;t &s;eiz'd her, &s;he had Recour&s;e to Tears, Sighs, and Reproaches, which drew nothing but Threats from the worthle&s;s Wretch: But at la&s;t, &s;he thought it wou'd be more to her purpo&s;e to di&s;&s;emble her Sorrows; therefore &s;he &s;eem'd, by degrees, to dry up her Tears, and li&s;ten more favourably to his odious Love.</P>
<P>This Method deceiv'd him &s;o effectually, that he did not doubt but &s;he wou'd give her Con&s;ent to the Marriage in a few Days. She had prevail'd upon one of his Men to bring a Letter to me, and he was to &s;et out on the following Morning.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="292">We landed at <HI>We&s;ton,</HI> and order'd our Boat to meet us at <HI>Thornbury</HI> the next Day, where we were oblig'd to go altogether, in a Waggon, not meeting with any better Con|veniency. But having the Company of my lovely <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> with my Uncle and Friends, I was in as much Joy, as if we were riding in our Coach and Six.</P>
<P>When we came within half a Mile of <HI>Thornbury,</HI> the Fields being plea&s;ant, we all got out to walk. I, with my charming <HI>I&s;abel|la,</HI> led the Way, full of the delightful Hope of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing for ever that Beauty, who was the Trea&s;ure of my Soul.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as we cro&s;s'd a Stile that led into the Hor&s;e Road, I ob&s;erv'd four or five Men run into a Thicket, that led into the Fields, on the other Side of the Road. This alarm'd me very much, and I made a full Stop till my Company came up.</P>
<P>By ill Fortune (expecting no Danger) we had left our Pi&s;tols in the Waggon, and the &s;horter Cut being over the Fields, the Wag|gon was a Quarter of a Mile behind us. While we were di&s;puting what to do, the five Men came running cro&s;s the Road, with that infamous Villain, Sir <HI>Eu&s;tace,</HI> at the Head of them. My Friend knowing him,
<PB N="291" REF="293">
ran to oppo&s;e him, unarm'd as he was. The Villain fir'd a Pi&s;tol at him, which brought my Friend to the Ground. The Sight rais'd &s;uch a Rage in my Soul, that I ru&s;h'd up|on him, ju&s;t as he pre&s;ented a Pi&s;tol to my Brea&s;t, and &s;o opportunely, that I clapt my Hand between the Flint and the Lock, ju&s;t as he drew the Trigger, and, with &s;trug|gling to wrench it from him, the Flint cut the Back of my Hand very much. I at la&s;t, with much Difficulty, wrung it from him, and &s;hot him through the Head with his own Pi&s;tol.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he fell, his Companions in Villainy ran away, without once looking be|hind them; and I flew to my Friend, who, thank Heaven, was only wounded &s;lightly on the Temple.</P>
<P>This was all done &s;o &s;uddenly, that it look'd like a Dream. When the Confu&s;ion was over, we went to examine that impious Wretch, who, notwith&s;tanding his Villainy, I wi&s;h'd in my Soul he had Life enough left to repent. But alas! he was gone for ever, with all his Sins about him.</P>
<P>When we came to <HI>Thornbury,</HI> our Boat|men met us, with a Croud of People, arm'd with &s;everal Weapons, coming to our A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance.
<PB N="292" REF="294">
The unfortunate Sir <HI>Eu&s;tace</HI> over|took them in their &s;hort Voyage to <HI>Thorn|bury,</HI> and by Threats made them (though unwillingly) confe&s;s where they were to take us up. As &s;oon as Sir <HI>Eu&s;tace</HI> parted from them, to put his wicked Intentions in Prac|tice, the Boatmen alarm'd the Town, which we met coming to our A&s;&s;i&s;tance, tho' too late.</P>
<P>I went to a neighbouring Ju&s;tice, and de|clar'd what had happen'd, who took Bail of my Uncle for my Appearance at the Se&s;|&s;ions: But I was never troubled about it. His Servants were found, who took up the Body, which was interr'd privately by his younger Brother, a worthy Gentleman, that prov'd as much an Honour to the Family he &s;prung from, as the other &s;trove to di&s;|grace it.</P>
<P>The next Day we embark'd for <HI>Chep&s;tow,</HI> and the &s;ame Evening arriv'd &s;afe at <HI>Mon|mouth,</HI> to the Comfort of my Governor, <HI>El|vira,</HI> and the amiable <HI>Fatima.</HI> From thence we &s;et out for my Uncle's.</P>
<P>In a few Days after, my Brother with the fair <HI>Fatima</HI> (after receiving at the Font the Chri&s;tian Name of <HI>Maria,</HI> at my Uncle's Re|que&s;t) <HI>Clerimont</HI> and his <HI>Eliza,</HI> and my dear <HI>I&s;abella</HI> and I, join'd tho&s;e Hands, with the
<PB N="293" REF="295">
A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Prie&s;t, who&s;e Hearts were united long before. And that we might be witne&s;s to each others Happine&s;s, all dwelt in the &s;ame Hou&s;e with my Uncle.</P>
<P>Thus, after &s;o many Storms of Fortune, we arriv'd &s;afe in the Harbour of Delight, and [ta&s;ted Joys beyond Expre&s;&s;ion. Long may our Years continue, in all the Harmony of connubial Love! All our Wi&s;hes are, to go Step by Step together; and when the hoary Winter of our Age approaches, to &s;ink Hand in Hand into the Grave, and re&s;t in Peace.</P>
