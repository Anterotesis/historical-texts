<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of <HI>BRITAIN,</HI> from the Inva&s;ion of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> to the Abdication of the <HI>Romans.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BRITAIN was but very little known to the re&s;t of the world before the time of the Romans. The coa&s;ts oppo&s;ite Gaul were frequented by mer|chants who traded thither for &s;uch commodities as the natives were able to produce. The&s;e, it is thought, after a time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of all the maritime places where they had at fir&s;t been permit|ted to re&s;ide. There, finding the country fertile, and commodiou&s;ly &s;ituated for trade, they &s;ettled upon the &s;ea-&s;ide, and introduced the practice of agricul|ture. But it was very different with the inland inha|bitants of the country, who con&s;idered them&s;elves as the lawful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the &s;oil. The&s;e avoided all
<PB N="2" REF="5">
corre&s;pondence with the new comers, whom they con&s;idered as intruders upon their property.</P>
<P>The inland inhabitants are repre&s;ented as extremely numerous, living in cottages thatched with &s;traw, and feeding large herds of cattle. They lived mo&s;tly up|on milk, or fle&s;h procured by the chace. What cloaths they wore to cover any part of their bodies, were u&s;ually the &s;kins of bea&s;ts; but much of their bodies, as the arms, legs, and thighs, was left naked, and tho&s;e parts were u&s;ually painted blue. Their hair, which was long, flowed down upon their backs and &s;houlders, while their beards were kept clo&s;e &s;haven, except upon the upper lip, where it was &s;uf|fered to grow. The dre&s;s of &s;avage nations is every where pretty much the &s;ame, being calculated rather to in&s;pire terror than to excite love or re&s;pect.</P>
<P>As to their government, it con&s;i&s;ted of &s;everal &s;mall principalities, each under its re&s;pective leader; and this &s;eems to be the earlie&s;t mode of dominion with which mankind are acquainted, and deduced from the natural privileges of paternal authority. Upon great, or uncommon dangers, a commander in chief was cho&s;en by common con&s;ent, in a general a&s;&s;embly; and to him was committed the conduct of the general intere&s;t, the power of making peace, or leading to war.</P>
<P>Their forces con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of foot, and yet they could bring a con&s;iderable number of hor&s;e into the field upon great occa&s;ions. They likewi&s;e u&s;ed cha|riots in battle, which, with &s;hort &s;cythes fa&s;tened to the ends of the axle-trees, inflicted terrible wounds, &s;preading terror and deva&s;tation where&s;oever they drove. Nor while the chariots were thus de&s;troying, were the warriors who conducted them unemployed. The&s;e darted their javelins again&s;t the enemy, ran along the beam, leapt on the ground, re&s;umed their &s;eat, &s;topt, or turned their hor&s;es at full &s;peed, and
<PB N="3" REF="6">
&s;ometimes cunningly retreated, to draw the enemy into confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The religion of the Britons was one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable parts of their government; and the Druids, who were the guardians of it, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great authority among them. No &s;pecies of &s;uper&s;tition was ever more terrible than theirs; be&s;ides the &s;evere penalties which they were permitted to inflict in this world, they inculcated the eternal tran&s;migration of &s;ouls, and thus extended their authority as far as the fears of their votaries. They &s;acrificed human vic|tims, which they burned in large wicker idols, made &s;o capacious as to contain a multitude of per&s;ons at once, who were thus con&s;umed together. To the&s;e rites, tending to impre&s;s ignorance with awe, they added the au&s;terity of their manners, and the &s;im|plicity of their lives. They lived in woods, caves, and hollow trees; their food was acorns and berries, and their drink water; by the&s;e arts, they were not only re&s;pected, but almo&s;t adored by the people.</P>
<P>It may be ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;ed, that the manners of the people took a tincture from the di&s;cipline of their teach|ers. Their lives were &s;imple, but they were mark|ed with cruelty and fiercene&s;s; their courage was great, but neither dignified by mercy nor per&s;eve|rance.</P>
<P>The Britons had long remained in this rude but in|dependent &s;tate, when Cae&s;ar having over-run Gaul with his victories, and willing &s;till farther to extend his fame, determined upon the conque&s;t of a country that &s;eemed to promi&s;e an ea&s;y triumph. When the troops de&s;tined for the expedition were embarked, he &s;et &s;ail for Britain about midnight, and the next morning arrived on the coa&s;t near Dover, where he &s;aw the rocks and cliffs covered with armed men to oppo&s;e his landing.</P>
<P>The Britons had cho&s;en Ca&s;&s;ibelaunus for their commander in chief, but the petty princes under
<PB N="4" REF="7">
his command, either de&s;iring his &s;tation, or &s;u&s;pect|ing his fidelity, threw off their allegiance. Some of them fled with their forces into the internal parts of the kingdom, others &s;ubmitted to Cae&s;ar, till at length Caffibelaunus him&s;elf, weakened by &s;o many de&s;er|tions, re&s;olved upon making what terms he was able while he yet had power to keep the field. The con|ditions offered by Cae&s;ar, and accepted by him were, that he &s;hould &s;end to the continent double the num|ber of ho&s;tages at fir&s;t demanded, and that he &s;hould acknowledge &s;ubjection to the Romans. Cae&s;ar, however, was obliged to return once more to com|pel the Britons to compleat their &s;tipulated treaty.</P>
<P>Upon the acce&s;&s;ion of Augu&s;tus, that emperor had formed a de&s;ign of vi&s;iting Britain, but was diverted from it by an unexpected revolt of the Pannoni|ans.</P>
<P>Tiberius, wi&s;ely judging the empire already too ex|ten&s;ive, made no attempt upon Britain. From that time the natives began to improve in all the arts which contribute to the advancement of human nature.</P>
<P>The wild extravagancies of Caligula, by which he threatened Britain with an inva&s;ion, &s;erved rather to expo&s;e him to ridicule than the i&s;land to danger. At length the Romans, in the reign of Claudius, began to think &s;eriou&s;ly of reducing them under their domi|nion. The expedition for this purpo&s;e was conducted in the beginning by Plautius and other commanders, with that &s;ucce&s;s which u&s;ually attended the Roman arms.</P>
<P>Caractacus was the fir&s;t who &s;eemed willing, by a vigorous effort, to re&s;cue his country and repel its in|&s;ulting and rapacious conquerors. This rude &s;oldier, though with inferior forces, continued, for above nine years, to oppo&s;e and harra&s;s the Romans; till at length he was totally routed, and taken pri&s;oner by O&s;torius Scapula, who &s;ent him in triumph to Rome. While Caractacus was leading thro' Rome,
<PB N="5" REF="8">
he appeared no way dejected at the amazing con|cour&s;e of &s;pectators that were gathered upon this oc|ca&s;ion, but ca&s;ting his eyes on the &s;plendours that &s;urrounded him, "Alas, cried he, how is it po&s;&s;ible that a people po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch magnificence at home could envy me an humble cottage in Britain!" The emperor was affected with the Briti&s;h hero's misfor|tunes, and won by his addre&s;s. He ordered him to be unchained upon the &s;pot, and &s;et at liberty with the re&s;t of the captives.</P>
<P>The cruel treatment of Boadicea, queen of the Iceni, drove the Britons once more into open rebellion. Pra|&s;atagus, king of the Iceni, at his death had bequeath|ed one-half of his dominions to the Romans, and the other to his daughters, thus hoping by the &s;acrifice of a part, to &s;ecure the re&s;t in his family: but it had a different effect; for the Roman procurator immedi|ately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole; and when Boadi|cea, the widow of the decea&s;ed, attempted to remon|&s;trate, he ordered her to be &s;courged like a &s;lave, and violated the cha&s;tity of her daughters. The&s;e outra|ges were &s;ufficient to produce a revolt throughout the i&s;land. The Iceni, as being the mo&s;t deeply intere&s;ted in the quarrel, were the fir&s;t to take arms; all the other &s;tates &s;oon followed the example; and Boadi|cea, a woman of great beauty and ma&s;culine &s;pirit, was appointed to head the common forces, which a|mounted to two hundred and thirty thou&s;and fight|ing men. The&s;e, exa&s;perated by their wrongs, at|tacked &s;everal of the Roman &s;ettlements and colonies with &s;ucce&s;s. Paulinus, who commanded the Ro|man forces, ha&s;tened to relieve London, which was already a flouri&s;hing colony; but found on his arri|val that it would be requi&s;ite for the general &s;afety to abandon that place to the mercile&s;s fury of the ene|my. London was &s;oon therefore reduced to a&s;hes; &s;uch of the inhabitants as remained in it were ma&s;|&s;acred; and the Romans, with all other &s;trangers,
<PB N="6" REF="9">
to the number of &s;eventy thou&s;and, were cruelly put to the &s;word. Flu&s;hed with the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es, the Bri|tons no longer &s;ought to avoid the enemy, but boldly came to the place where Paulinus awaited their arri|val, po&s;ted in a very advantageous manner with a body of ten thou&s;and men. The battle was ob&s;tinate and bloody. Boadicea her&s;elf appeared in a chariot with her two daughters, and harrangued her army with ma&s;culine intrepidity; but the irregular and un|di&s;ciplined bravery of her troops was unable to re&s;i&s;t the cool intrepidity of the Romans. They were rout|ed with great &s;laughter, eighty thou&s;and peri&s;hed in the field, and an infinite number were made pri&s;o|ners, while Boadicea her&s;elf, fearing to fall into the hands of the enraged victor, put an end to her life by poi&s;on.</P>
<P>The general who finally e&s;tabli&s;hed the dominion of the Romans in this i&s;land was Julius Agricola, who governed it during the reigns of Ve&s;pa&s;ian, Titus, and Domitian, and di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf as well by his courage as humanity.</P>
<P>For &s;everal years after the time of Agricola, a pro|found peace &s;eems to have prevailed in Britain, and little mention is made of the affairs of the i&s;land by any hi&s;torian.</P>
<P>At length, however, Rome, that had for ages given laws to nations, and diffu&s;ed &s;lavery and oppre&s;&s;ion over the known world, at length began to &s;ink under her own magnificence. Mankind, as if by a general con&s;ent, ro&s;e up to vindicate their natural freedom; almo&s;t every nation a&s;&s;erting that independence which they had been long &s;o unju&s;tly deprived of.</P>
<P>During the&s;e &s;truggles the Briti&s;h youth were fre|quently drawn away into Gaul, to give ineffectual &s;uccour to the various contenders for the empire, who, falling in every attempt, only left the name of ty|rants behind them. In the mean time, as the Roman forces decrea&s;ed in Britain, the Picts and Scots con|tinued
<PB N="7" REF="10">
&s;till more boldly to infe&s;t the northern parts; and cro&s;&s;ing the friths, which the Romans could not guard, in little wicker boats, covered with leather, filled the country wherever they came with &s;laughter and con&s;ternation.</P>
<P>The Romans, therefore, finding it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;tand their ground in Britain, in the reign of the em|peror Valentinian took their la&s;t leave of the i&s;land, after being ma&s;ters of it for ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> four hundred years, and now left the natives to the choice of their own government and kings. They gave them the be&s;t in|&s;tructions the calamitous times would permit, for ex|erci&s;ing their arms, and repairing their ramparts, and helped them to erect a-new a wall of &s;tone built by the emperor Severus acro&s;s the i&s;land, which they had not at that time artizans &s;kilful enough among them|&s;elves to repair.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. THE SAXONS.</HEAD>
<P>THE Britons being now left to them&s;elves, con|&s;idered their new liberties as their greate&s;t cala|mity.</P>
<P>The Picts and Scots uniting together, began to look upon Britain as their own, and attacked the northern wall which the Romans had built to keep off their incur&s;ions, with &s;ucce&s;s. Having thus opened to them&s;elves a pa&s;&s;age, they ravaged the whole country with impunity, while the Britons &s;ought precarious &s;helter in their woods and mountains.</P>
<P>It was in this deplorable and enfeebled &s;tate that the Britons had recour&s;e to the Saxons, a brave peo|ple; who, for their &s;trength and valour, were formi|able to all the German nations around them, and &s;up|po&s;ed to be more than a match for the gods them|&s;elves.
<PB N="8" REF="11">
They were a people re&s;tle&s;s and bold, who con&s;idered war as their trade; and were, in con&s;e|quence, taught to con&s;ider victory as a doubtful ad|vantage, but courage as a certain good. A nation, however, entirely addicted to war, has &s;eldom wanted the imputation of cruelty, as tho&s;e terrors which are oppo&s;ed without fear, are often inflicted without re|gret. The Saxons are repre&s;ented as a very cruel na|tion; but we mu&s;t remember that their enemies have drawn the picture.</P>
<P>It was no di&s;agreeable circum&s;tance to the&s;e ambi|tious people to be invited into a country upon which they had, for ages before, been forming de&s;igns. In con&s;equence, therefore, of Vortigern's &s;olemn invi|tation, who was then king of Britain, they arrived with fifteen hundred men, under the command of Hengi&s;t and Hor&s;a, who were brothers, and landed on the i&s;le of Thanet. There they did not long re|main inactive; but, being joined by the Briti&s;h for|ces, they boldly marched again&s;t the Picts and Scots, who had advanced as far as Lincoln&s;hire, and &s;oon gained a compleat victory over them.</P>
<P>The Saxons, however, being &s;en&s;ible of the fertility of the country to which they came, and the barrenne&s;s of that which they had left behind, invited over great numbers of their countrymen to become &s;harers in their new expedition. Accordingly they received a fre&s;h &s;upply of five thou&s;and men, who pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;eventeen ve&s;&s;els, and &s;oon made a permanent e&s;ta|bli&s;hment in the i&s;land.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h hi&s;torians, in order to account for the ea&s;y conque&s;t of their country by the Saxons, a&s;&s;ign their treachery, not le&s;s than their valour, as a princi|pal cau&s;e. They alledge that Vortigern was artfully inveigled into a pa&s;&s;ion for Rowena, the daughter of Hengi&s;t; and, in order to marry her, was induced to &s;ettle the fertile province of Kent upon her father, from whence the Saxons could never after be removed.
<PB N="9" REF="12">
It is alledged al&s;o that, upon the death of Vortimer, which &s;hortly happened after the victory he obtained at Eglesford, Vortigern his father was rein&s;tated up|on the throne. It is added that this weak monarch accepting of a fe&s;tival from Hengi&s;t, three hundred of his nobility were treacherou&s;ly &s;laughtered, and him&s;elf detained as a captive.</P>
<P>After the death of Hengi&s;t, &s;everal other German tribes, allured by the &s;ucce&s;s of their countrymen, went over in great numbers. A body of their coun|trymen, under the conduct of Aella and his three &s;ons, had &s;ome time before laid the foundation of the kingdom of the South Saxons, though not without great oppo&s;ition and blood&s;hed. This new kingdom included Surry, Su&s;&s;ex, and the New Fore&s;t: and extended to the frontiers of Kent.</P>
<P>Another tribe of Saxons, under the command of Cerdic and his &s;on Kenric, landed in the We&s;t, and from thence took the name of We&s;t Saxons. The&s;e met a very vigorous oppo&s;ition from the natives, but being reinforced from Germany, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by their countrymen on the i&s;land, they routed the Britons; and although retarded in their progre&s;s by the cele|brated king Arthur, they had &s;trength enough to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the conque&s;ts they had already made. Cerdic, therefore, with his &s;on Kenric, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed the third Saxon kingdom in the i&s;land, name|ly, that of the We&s;t Saxons, including the counties of Hants, Dor&s;et, Wilts, Berks, and the i&s;le of Wight.</P>
<P>It was in oppo&s;ing this Saxon invader that the ce|lebrated prince Arthur acquired his fame. How&s;o|ever un&s;ucce&s;sful all his valour might have been in the end, yet his name makes &s;o great a figure in the fabulous annals of the times, that &s;ome notice mu&s;t be taken of him. This prince is of &s;uch ob&s;cure ori|ginal, that &s;ome authors &s;uppo&s;e him to be the &s;on of king Ambro&s;ius, and others only his nephew; others
<PB N="10" REF="13">
again affim that he was a Corni&s;h prince, and &s;on of Gurlois, king of that province. However this be, it is certain he was a commander of great valour, and could courage alone repair the mi&s;erable &s;tate of the Britons, his might have been effectual. According to the mo&s;t authentic hi&s;torians, he is &s;aid to have wor&s;ted the Saxons in twelve &s;ucce&s;&s;ive battles. In one of the&s;e, namely, that fought at Caerbadon, in Berks, it is a&s;&s;erted that he killed no le&s;s than four hundred and forty of the enemy with his own hand. But the Saxons were too numerous and powerful to be extirpated by the de&s;ultory efforts of &s;ingle valour; &s;o that a peace, and not conque&s;t, were the immedi|ate fruits of his victories. The enemy, therefore, &s;till gained ground; and this prince, in the decline of life, had the mortification, from &s;ome dome&s;tic troubles of his own, to be a patient &s;pectator of their encroachments. His fir&s;t wi&s;e had been carried off by Melnas, king of Somer&s;et&s;hire, who detained her a whole year at Gla&s;tonbury, until Arthur, di&s;cover|ing the place of her retreat, advanced with an army again&s;t the ravi&s;her, and obliged him to give her back. In his &s;econd wife, perhaps, he might have been more fortunate, as we have no mention made of her, but it was otherwi&s;e with his third con&s;ort, who was debauched by his own nephew, Mordred. This produced a rebellion, in which the king and his traiterous kin&s;man meeting in battle, &s;lew each other.</P>
<P>In the mean time, while the Saxons were thus gaining ground in the We&s;t, their countrymen were not le&s;s active in other parts of the i&s;land. Adventu|rers &s;till continuing to pour over from Germany, one body of them, under the command of U&s;&s;a, &s;eized upon the counties of Cambridge, Suffolk, and Nor|folk, and gave their commander the title of king of the Ea&s;t Angles, which was the fourth Saxon king|dom founded in Britain</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="14">Another body of the&s;e adventurers formed a kingdom under the title of Ea&s;t Saxony, or E&s;&s;ex, comprehending E&s;&s;ex, Middle&s;ex, and part of Hert|ford&s;hire. This kingdom, which was di&s;membered from that of Kent, formed the fifth Saxon principa|lity founded in Britain.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Mercia was the &s;ixth which was e&s;tabli&s;hed by the&s;e fierce invaders, comprehending all the middle counties, from the banks of the Severn to the frontiers of the two la&s;t named kingdoms.</P>
<P>The &s;eventh and la&s;t kingdom which they obtained was that of Northumberland, one of the mo&s;t power|ful and exten&s;ive of them all. This was formed from the union of two &s;maller Saxon kingdoms, the one called Bernicia, containing the pre&s;ent county of Northumberland and the bi&s;hoprick of Durham; the &s;ubjects of the other, called the Deiri, extending them|&s;elves over Lanca&s;hire and York&s;hire. The&s;e king|doms were united in the per&s;on of Ethelfrid, king of Northumberland, by the expul&s;ion of Edwin, his brother-in-law, from the kingdom of the Deiri, and the &s;eizure of his dominions. In this manner the natives being overpowered, or entirely expelled, &s;even kingdoms were e&s;tabli&s;hed in Britain, which have been &s;ince well known by the name of the Saxon Heptarchy.</P>
<P>The Saxons being thus e&s;tabli&s;hed in all the de|&s;irable parts of the i&s;land, and having no longer the Britons to contend with, began to quarrel among them&s;elves. A country divided into a number of petty independent principalities, mu&s;t ever be &s;ubject to contention, as jealou&s;ly and ambition have more frequent incentives to operate. After a &s;eries, there|fore, of battles, trea&s;ons, and &s;tratagems, all the&s;e petty principalities fell under the power of Egbert, king of We&s;&s;ex, who&s;e merits de&s;erved dominion, and who&s;e prudence &s;ecured his conque&s;ts. By him all the kingdoms of the Heptarchy were united un|der
<PB N="12" REF="15">
one common juri&s;diction; but, to give &s;plendour to his authority, a general council of the clergy and laity was &s;ummoned at Winche&s;ter, where he was &s;o|lemnly crowned king of England, by which name the united kingdom was thenceforward called.</P>
<P>Thus, about four hundred years after the fir&s;t ar|rival of the Saxons in Britain, all their petty &s;ettle|ments were united into one great &s;tate, and nothing offered but pro&s;pects of peace, &s;ecurity, and increa&s;|ing refinement.</P>
<P>It was about this period that St. Gregory undertook to &s;end mi&s;&s;ionaries among the Saxons to convert them to Chri&s;tianity. It is &s;aid, that before his elevation to the papal chair, he chanced one day to pa&s;s thro' the &s;lave-market at Rome, and perceiving &s;ome chil|dren of great beauty who were &s;et up for &s;ale, he en|quired about their country, and finding they were Engli&s;h pages, be is &s;aid to have cried out, in the Latin language, <HI>Non Angli, &s;ed Angeli forent, &s;i e&s;&s;ent Chri&s;tiani</HI>; They would not be Engli&s;h, but Angels, had they been Chri&s;tians. From that time he was &s;truck with an ardent de&s;ire to convert that unenlight|ened nation, and ordered a monk, named Augu&s;tine, and others of the &s;ame fraternity, to undertake the mi&s;&s;ion into Britain.</P>
<P>This pious monk, upon his fir&s;t landing in the i&s;le of Thanet, &s;ent one of his interpreters to Ethel|bert, the Kenti&s;h king, declaring he was come from Rome with offers of eternal &s;alvation. The king immediately ordered them to be furni&s;hed with all nece&s;&s;aries, and even vi&s;ited them, though without declaring him&s;elf as yet in their favour. Augu&s;tine, however, encouraged by this favourable reception, and now &s;eeing a pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, proceeded with redoubled zeal to preach the go&s;pel. The king openly e&s;pou&s;ed the Chri&s;tian religion, while his example wrought &s;o &s;uccesfully on his &s;ubjects, that numbers of them came voluntarily to be baptized, their mi&s;&s;i|oner
<PB N="13" REF="16">
loudly declaring again&s;t any coercive means towards their conver&s;ion. In this manner the other kingdoms, one after the other, embraced the faith; and England was &s;oon as famous for its &s;uper&s;tition as it had once been for its aver&s;ene&s;s to Chri&s;tianity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. THE INVASION OF THE DANES.</HEAD>
<P>PEACE and unanimity had been &s;carcely e&s;tabli&s;h|ed in England when a mighty &s;warm of tho&s;e nations called Danes, who had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the coun|tries bordering on the Baltic, began to level their fu|ry again&s;t England. A &s;mall body of them at fir&s;t landed on the coa&s;ts, with a view to learn the &s;tate of the country; and having committed &s;ome &s;mall depredations, fled to their &s;hips for &s;afety. About &s;even years after this fir&s;t attempt, they made a de|&s;cent upon the kingdom of Northumberland, where they pillaged a mona&s;tery; but their fleet being &s;hat|tered by a &s;torm, they were defeated by the inhabi|tants, and put to the &s;word. It was not till about five years after the acce&s;&s;ion of Egbert, that their in|va&s;ions became truly formidable. From that time they continued, with uncea&s;ing ferocity, until the whole kingdom was reduced to a &s;tate of the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;sful bondage.</P>
<P>Though often repul&s;ed, they always obtained their end, of &s;poiling the country, and carrying the plun|der away. It was their method to avoid coming, if po&s;&s;ible, to a general engagement; but &s;cattering them&s;elves over the face of the country, they carried away, indi&s;criminately, as well the inhabitants them|&s;elves, as all their moveable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>At length, however, they re&s;olved upon making a &s;ettlement in the country, and landing on the i&s;le
<PB N="14" REF="17">
of Thanet, &s;tationed them&s;elves there. In this place they kept their ground, notwith&s;tanding a bloody vic|tory gained over them by Ethelwolf. The reign of Ethelbald, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, was of no long continuance; however, in &s;o &s;hort &s;pace, he crouded a number of vices &s;ufficient to render his name odious to po&s;te|rity.</P>
<P>This prince was &s;ucceeded by his brother Ethelred, a brave commander, but who&s;e valour was in&s;ufficient to repre&s;s the Dani&s;h incur&s;ions. In the&s;e exploits he was always a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his younger brother, Alfred, afterwards &s;urnamed the Great, who &s;acrificed all private re&s;entment to the public good, having been deprived by the king of a large patrimony. It was during Ethelred's reign, that the Danes, penetrating into Mercia, took up their winter quarters at Not|tingham; from whence, the king, attempting to di&s;|lodge them, received a wound in the battle, of which he died, leaving his brother, Alfred, the inheritance of a kingdom that was now reduced to the brink of ruin.</P>
<P>The Danes had already &s;ubdued Northumberland and Ea&s;t Anglia, and had penetrated into the very heart of We&s;&s;ex. The Mercians were united again&s;t Alfred; the dependence upon the other provinces of the empire was but precarious: the lands lay un|cultivated, through fears of continual incur&s;ions; and all the churches and mona&s;teries were burned to the ground. In this terrible &s;ituation of affairs, nothing appeared but objects of terror, and every hope was lo&s;t in de&s;pair. The wi&s;dom and virtues of one man alone were &s;ound &s;ufficient to bring back happine&s;s, &s;ecurity, and order; and all the calamities of the times found redre&s;s from Alfred.</P>
<P>This prince &s;eemed born not only to defend his bleeding country, but even to adorn humanity. He had given very early in&s;tances of tho&s;e great virtues which afterwards gave &s;plendour to his reign; and
<PB N="15" REF="18">
was anointed by pope Leo, as future king, when he was &s;ent by his father for his education to Rome. On his return from thence, he became every day more the object of his father's fond affections; and that, per|haps, was the rea&s;on why his education was at fir&s;t neglected. He had attained the age of twelve, before he was made acquainted with the lowe&s;t elements of literature; but hearing &s;ome Saxon poems read, which recounted the prai&s;e of heroes, his whole mind was rou&s;ed, not only to obtain a &s;imiltude of glory, but al&s;o to be able to tran&s;mit that glory to po&s;terity. Encouraged by the queen, his mother, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a penetrating genius, he &s;oon learned to read the&s;e compo&s;itions, and proceeded from thence to a knowledge of Latin authors, who directed his ta&s;te, and rectified his ambition.</P>
<P>He was &s;carce come to the crown, when he was obliged to oppo&s;e the Danes, who had &s;eized Wil|ton, and were exerci&s;ing their u&s;ual ravages on the country around. He marched again&s;t them with the few troops he could a&s;&s;emble on a &s;udden, and a de&s;perate battle was &s;ought, to the di&s;advantage of the Engli&s;h. But it was not in the power of misfortune to abate the king's diligence, though it repre&s;&s;ed his power to do good. He was in a little time enabled to hazard another engagement; &s;o that the enemy, dreading his courage and activity, propo&s;ed terms of peace, which he did not think proper to refu&s;e. They, by this treaty, agreed to relinqui&s;h the kingdom; but, in&s;tead of complying with their engagements, they only removed from one place to another, burn|ing and de&s;troying wherever they came.</P>
<P>Alfred, thus oppo&s;ed to an enemy whom no &s;tati|onary force could re&s;i&s;t, nor no treaty could bind, found him&s;elf unable to repel the efforts of tho&s;e ra|vagers, who from all quarters invaded him. New &s;warms of the enemy arrived every year upon the coa&s;t, and fre&s;h inva&s;ions were &s;till projected. Some
<PB N="16" REF="19">
of his &s;ubjects therefore left their country, and retir|ed into Wales, or fled to the continent. Others &s;ub|mitted to the conquerors, and purcha&s;ed their lives by their freedom. In this univer&s;al defection, Alfred vainly attempted to remind them of the duty they owed their country and their king; but finding his remon&s;trances ineffectual, he was obliged to give way to the wretched nece&s;&s;ity of the times. Accord|ingly, relinqui&s;hing the en&s;igns of his dignity, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ing his &s;ervants, he dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the ha|bit of a pea&s;ant, and lived for &s;ome time in the hou&s;e of an herd&s;man, who had been entru&s;ted with the care of his cattle. In this manner, though abandon|ed by the world, and fearing an enemy in every quarter, &s;till he re&s;olved to continue in his country, to catch the &s;lighte&s;t occa&s;ions for bringing it relief. In his &s;olitary retreat, which was in the county of Somer&s;et, at the confluence of the rivers Parret and Thone, he amu&s;ed him&s;elf with mu&s;ic, and &s;upport|ed his humble lot with the hopes of better fortune. It is &s;aid, that, one day, being commanded by the herd&s;man's wife, who was ignorant of his quality, to take care of &s;ome cakes which were baking by the fire, he happened to let them burn, for which &s;he &s;everely upbraided him for neglect.</P>
<P>Previous to his retirement, Alfred had concerted mea&s;ures for a&s;&s;embing a few tru&s;ty friends, when|ever an opportunity &s;hould offer of annoying the ene|my, who were now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the coun|try. This cho&s;en band, &s;till faithful to their mo|narch, took &s;helter in the fore&s;ts and mar&s;hes of So|mer&s;et, and from thence made occa&s;ional irruptions upon &s;traggling parties of the enemy. Their &s;ucce&s;s, in this rapacious and dreary method of living, encou|raged many more to join their &s;ociety, till at length &s;ufficiently augmented, they repaired to their mo|narch, who had by that time been reduced by famine to the la&s;t extremity.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="20">Mean while Ubba, the chief of the Dani&s;h command|ers, carried terror over the whole land, and now ra|vaged the country of Wales without oppo&s;ition. The only place where he found re&s;i&s;tance was, in his re|turn, from the ca&s;tle of Kenwith, into which the earl of Devon&s;hire had retired with a &s;mall body of troops. This gallant &s;oldier finding him&s;elf unable to &s;u&s;tain a &s;iege, and knowing the danger of &s;urrendering to a perfidious enemy, was re&s;olved, by one de&s;perate effort, to &s;ally out and force his way through the be|&s;iegers, &s;word in hand. The propo&s;al was embraced by all his followers, while the Danes, &s;ecure in their numbers, and in their contempt of the enemy, were not only routed with great &s;laughter, but Ubba, their general, was &s;lain.</P>
<P>This victory once more re&s;tored courage to the di&s;pirited Saxons; and Alfred, taking advantage of their favourable di&s;po&s;ition, prepared to animate them to a vigorous exertion of their &s;uperiority. He &s;oon therefore apprized them of the place of his retreat, and in&s;tructed them to be ready with all their &s;trength at a minute's warning. But &s;till none was found who would undertake to give intelligence of the for|ces, and po&s;ture of the enemy: not knowing, there|fore, a per&s;on in whom he could confide, he under|took this dangerous ta&s;k him&s;elf. In the &s;imple dre&s;s of a &s;hepherd, with an harp in his hand, he entered the Dani&s;h camp, tried all his mu&s;ical arts to plea&s;e, and was &s;o much admired, that he was brought even into the pre&s;ence of Guthrum, the Dani&s;h prince, with whom he remained &s;ome days. There he remark|ed the &s;upine &s;ecurity of the Danes, their contempt of the Engli&s;h, their negligence in foraging and plun|dering, and their di&s;&s;olute wa&s;ting of &s;uch ill-gotten booty. Having made his ob&s;ervations, he returned to his retreat, and detaching proper emi&s;&s;aries among his &s;ubjects, appointed them to meet him in arms in
<PB N="18" REF="21">
the fore&s;t of Selwood, a &s;ummons which they gladly obeyed.</P>
<P>It was again&s;t the mo&s;t unguarded quarter of the enemy that Alfred made his mo&s;t violent attack, while the Danes, &s;urprized to behold an army of Engli&s;h, whom they con&s;idered as totally &s;ubdued, made but a faint re&s;i&s;tance. Notwith&s;tanding the &s;u|periority of their number, they were routed with great &s;laughter; and, though &s;uch as e&s;caped fled for refuge into a fortified camp in the neighbourhood, being unprovided for a &s;iege, in le&s;s than a fortnight they were compelled to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion. By the conqueror's permi&s;&s;ion, tho&s;e who did not chu&s;e to embrace Chri&s;tianity embarked for Flanders, under the command of one of their generals, called Ha&s;t|ings. Guthrum, their prince, became a convert, with thirty of his nobles, and the king him&s;elf an|&s;wered for him at the font.</P>
<P>Alfred had now attained the meridian of glory; he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a greater extent of territory than had ever been enjoyed by any of his predece&s;&s;ors; the kings of Wales did him homage for their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, the Northumbrians received a king of his appointing, and no enemy appeared to give him the lea&s;t apprehen|&s;ions, or excite an alarm. In this &s;tate of pro&s;perity and profound tranquility, which la&s;ted for twelve years, Alfred was diligently employed in cultivating the arts of peace, and in repairing the damages which the kingdom had &s;u&s;tained by war.</P>
<P>His care was to poli&s;h the country by arts, as he had protected it by arms. He is &s;aid to have drawn up a body of laws. His care for the encouragement of learning did not a little tend to improve the morals and re&s;train the barbarous habits of the people. When he came to the throne, he found the Engli&s;h &s;unk into the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ignorance and barbari&s;m, proceeding from the continued di&s;orders of the government, and from the ravages of the Danes. He him&s;elf
<PB N="19" REF="22">
complains, that, on his acce&s;&s;ion, he knew not one per&s;on &s;outh of the Thames who could &s;o much as interpret the Latin &s;ervice. To remedy this defi|ciency, he invited over the mo&s;t celebrated &s;cholars from all parts of Europe; he founded, or at lea&s;t re|e&s;tabli&s;hed, the univer&s;ity of Oxford, and endowed it with many privileges, and he gave, in his own ex|ample, the &s;tronge&s;t incentives to &s;tudy. He u&s;ually divided his time into three equal portions; one was given to &s;leep, and the refection of his body, diet, and exerci&s;e; another to the di&s;patch of bu&s;ine&s;s; and the third to &s;tudy and devotion. He made a con|&s;iderable progre&s;s in the different &s;tudies of grammar, rhetoric, philo&s;ophy, architecture, and geometry. He was an excellent hi&s;torian, he under&s;tood mu&s;ic, he was acknowledged to be the be&s;t Saxon poet of the age, and left many works behind him, &s;ome of which remain to this day. To give a character of this prince would only be, to &s;um up tho&s;e qualities which con&s;titute perfection. Even virtues &s;eemingly oppo&s;ite, were happily blended in his di&s;po&s;ition; per&s;evering, yet flexible; moderate, yet enterpri&s;ing; ju&s;t, yet merciful; &s;tern in command, yet gentle in conver&s;ation. Nature al&s;o, as if de&s;irous that &s;uch admirable qualities of mind &s;hould be &s;et off to the greate&s;t advantage, had be&s;towed on him all bodily accompli&s;hments, vigour, dignity, and an engaging, open countenance.</P>
<P>His &s;econd &s;on, Edward, &s;ucceeded him on the throne. To him &s;ucceeded Athel&s;tan, his natural &s;on, the illegitimacy of his birth not being then deemed a &s;ufficient ob&s;tacle to his inheriting the crown. He died at Glouce&s;ter, after a reign of &s;ixteen years, and was &s;ucceeded by his brother, Edmund, who, like the re&s;t of his predece&s;&s;ors, met with di&s;turbance from the Northumbrians on his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne; but his activity &s;oon defeated their attempts. The re&s;entment this monarch bore to men of an abandoned
<PB N="20" REF="23">
way of living was the cau&s;e of his death. He was killed by Leolff, a robber, at a fea&s;t, where this vil|lain had the in&s;olence to intrude into the king's pre|&s;ence. His brother, Edred, was appointed to &s;uc|ceed, and like his predece&s;&s;ors, this monarch found him&s;elf at the head of a rebellious and refractory people. Edred implicitly &s;ubmitted to the directions of Dun&s;tan the monk, both in church and &s;tate; and the kingdom was in a fair way of being turned into a papal province by this zealous eccle&s;ia&s;tic; but he was checked in the mid&s;t of his career, by the death of the king, who died of a quin&s;ey, in the tenth year of his reign.</P>
<P>Edwy, his nephew, who a&s;cended the throne, his own &s;ons being yet unfit to govern, was a prince of great per&s;onal accompli&s;hments, and a martial di&s;po|&s;ition. But he was now come to the government of a kingdom, in which he had an enemy to contend with, again&s;t whom all military virtues could be of little &s;ervice. Dun&s;tan, who had governed during the former reign, was re&s;olved to omit nothing of his authority in this; and Edwy, immediately up|on his acce&s;&s;ion, found him&s;elf involved in a quar|rel with the monks, who&s;e rage, neither his ac|compli&s;hments, nor his virtues could mitigate.</P>
<P>Among other in&s;tances of their cruelty, the fol|lowing is recorded. There was a lady of the royal blood, named Elgiva, who&s;e beauty had made a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion upon the young monarch's heart. He had even ventured to marry her, contrary to the advice of his coun&s;ellors, as &s;he was within the degrees of a&s;&s;inity prohibited by the canon law. On the day of his coronation, while his nobility were giving a loo&s;e to the more noi&s;y plea&s;ures of wine and fe&s;tivity in the great hall, Edwy retired to his wife's apartment; where, in company with her mother, he enjoyed the more plea&s;ing &s;atisfaction of her con|ver&s;ation. Dun&s;tan no &s;ooner perceived his ab&s;ence,
<PB N="21" REF="24">
than conjecturing the rea&s;on, he ru&s;hed furiou&s;ly in|to the apartment, and upbraiding him with all the bitterne&s;s of eccle&s;ia&s;tical rancour, dragged him forth in the mo&s;t outrageous manner. Dun&s;tan, it &s;eems, was not without his enemies, for the king was ad|vi&s;ed to puni&s;h this in&s;ult, by bringing him to ac|count for the money with which he had been entru&s;t|ed during the la&s;t reign. This account, the haughty monk refu&s;ed to give in; wherefore, he was deprived of all the eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil emoluments of which he had been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and bani&s;hed the kingdom. His exile only &s;erved to encrea&s;e the reputation of his &s;anctity with the people; among the re&s;t Odo, arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury, was &s;o far tran&s;ported with the &s;pirit of the party, that he pronounced a divorce between Edwy and Elgiva. The king was unable to re&s;i&s;t the indignation of the church, and con&s;ented to &s;ur|render his beautiful wife to its fury. Accordingly, Odo &s;ent into the palace a party of &s;oldiers, who &s;eized the queen; and, by his orders, branded her on the face with an hot iron. Not contented with this cruel vengeance, they carried her by force into Ireland, and there commanded her to remain in per|petual exile. This injunction, however, was too di&s;tre&s;&s;ing for that faithful woman to comply with; for, being cured of her wound, and having obliterated the marks which had been made to deface her beauty, &s;he once more ventured to return to the king, whom &s;he &s;till regarded as her hu&s;band. But misfortune continued to pur&s;ue her. She was taken pri&s;oner by a party whom the archbi&s;hop had appointed to ob|&s;erve her conduct, and was put to death in the mo&s;t cruel manner; the &s;inews of her legs being cut, and her body mangled, &s;he was thus left to expire in the mo&s;t cruel agony. In the mean time, a &s;ecret revolt again&s;t Edwy became almo&s;t general; and Dun&s;tan put him&s;elf at the head of the party. The malecon|tents at la&s;t proceeded to open rebellion; and having
<PB N="22" REF="25">
placed Edgar, the king's younger brother, a boy of about thirteen years of age, at their head, they &s;oon put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the northern parts of the kingdom. Edwy's power and the number of his ad|herents every day declining, he was at la&s;t obliged to con&s;ent to a partition of the kingdom; but his death, which happened &s;oon after, freed his enemies from all further inquietude, and gave Edgar peaceable po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the government.</P>
<P>Edgar being placed on the throne by the influence of the monks, affected to be entirely guided by their directions in all his &s;ucceeding tran&s;actions.</P>
<P>Little worthy of notice is mentioned of this mo|narch except his amour with Elfrida, which is of too &s;ingular a nature to be omitted. Edgar had long heard of the beauty of a young lady, who&s;e name was Elfrida, daughter to the earl of Devon&s;hire; but, unwilling to credit common fame, in this particular, he &s;ent Athelwald, his favourite friend, to &s;ee, and inform him, if Elfrida was indeed that incomparable woman report had de&s;cribed her. Ethelwald arriving at the earl's, had no &s;ooner ca&s;t his eyes upon that nobleman's daughter, than he became de&s;perately ena|moured of her him&s;elf. Such was the violence of his pa&s;&s;ion, that, forgetting his ma&s;ter's intentions, he &s;o|licited only his own intere&s;ts, and demanded for him|&s;elf the beautiful Elfrida, from her father in mar|riage. The favourite of a king was not likely to find a refu&s;al; the earl gave his con&s;ent, and their nupti|als were performed in private. Upon his return to court, which was &s;hortly after, he a&s;&s;ured the king, that her riches alone, and her high quality had been the cau&s;e of her fame, and he appeared amazed how the world could talk &s;o much, and &s;o unju&s;tly of her charms. The king was &s;atisfied, and no longer felt any curio&s;ity, while Ethelwald &s;ecretly triumphed in his addre&s;s. When he had, by this deceit, weaned the king from his purpo&s;e, he took an opportunity,
<PB N="23" REF="26">
after &s;ome time, of turning the conver&s;ation on El|frida, repre&s;enting, that though the fortune of the earl of Devon&s;hire's daughter would be a trifle to a king, yet it would be an immen&s;e acqui&s;ition to a needy &s;ubject. He, therefore, humbly entreated per|mi&s;&s;ion to pay his addre&s;&s;es to her, as &s;he was the riche&s;t heire&s;s in the kingdom. A reque&s;t &s;o &s;eem|ingly rea&s;onable, was readily complied with; Ethel|wald returned to his wife, and their nuptials were &s;o|lemnized in public. His greate&s;t care, however, was employed in keeping her from court; and he took every precaution to prevent her from appearing be|fore a king &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible of love, while &s;he was &s;o ca|pable of in&s;piring that pa&s;&s;ion. But it was impo&s;&s;ible to keep his treachery long concealed. Edgar was &s;oon informed of the whole tran&s;action; but di&s;&s;embling his re&s;entment, he took occa&s;ion to vi&s;it that part of the country, where this miracle of beauty was detain|ed, accompanied by Ethelwald, who reluctantly attend|ed him thither. Upon coming near the lady's habita|tion he told him, that he had a curio&s;ity to &s;ee his wife, of whom he had formerly heard &s;o much, and de&s;ired to be introduced as his acquaintance. Ethelwald, thunder-&s;truck at the propo&s;al, did all in his power, but in vain, to di&s;&s;uade him. All he could obtain, was permi&s;&s;ion to go before, on pretence of preparing for the king's reception. On his arrival, he fell at his wife's feet, confe&s;&s;ing what he had done to be po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of her charms, and conjuring her to conceal, as much as po&s;&s;ible, her beauty from the king, who was but too &s;u&s;ceptible of its power. Elfrida, little obliged to him for a pa&s;&s;ion that had deprived her of a crown, promi&s;ed compliance; but, prompted ei|ther by vanity, or revenge, adorned her per&s;on with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite art, and called up all her beauty on the occa&s;ion. The event an&s;wered her expecta|tions; the king, no &s;ooner &s;aw, than he loved her, and was in&s;tantly re&s;olved to obtain her. The better
<PB N="24" REF="27">
to effect his intentions, he concealed his pa&s;&s;ion from the hu&s;band, and took leave with a &s;eeming indiffe|rence; but his revenge was not the le&s;s certain and fatal. Ethelwald was &s;ome time after &s;ent into Nor|thumberland, upon pretence of urgent affairs, and was found murdered in a wood by the way. Some &s;ay be was &s;tabbed by the king's own hand; &s;ome, that he only commanded the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inaton; however this be, Elfrida was invited &s;oon after to court, by the king's own order, and their nuptials were performed with the u&s;ual &s;olemnity.</P>
<P>This monarch died, after a reign of &s;ixteen years, in the thirty-third year of his age, being &s;ucceeded by his &s;on, Edward, whom he had by his fir&s;t mar|riage, with the daughter of the earl of Ordmer.</P>
<P>Edward, &s;urnamed the Martyr, was made king by the intere&s;t of the monks, and lived but four years after his acce&s;&s;ion. In his reign there is nothing remarkable, if we except his tragical and memorable end. Hunting one day near Corfe ca&s;tle, where Elfrida, his mother-in-law re&s;ided, he thought it his duty to pay her a vi&s;it, although he was not attended by any of his retinue. There de&s;iring &s;ome liquor to be brought him, as he was thir&s;ty, while &s;he was yet holding the cup to his head, one of Elfrida's dome&s;|tics, in&s;tructed for that purpo&s;e, &s;tabbed him in the back. The king, finding him&s;elf wounded, put &s;purs to his hor&s;e; but, fainting with the lo&s;s of blood, he fell from the &s;addle, and his foot &s;ticking in the &s;tirrup, he was dragged along by his hor&s;e, till he died.</P>
<P>Ethelred the Second, the &s;on of Edgar and Elfrida, &s;ucceeded; a weak and irre&s;olute monarch, inca|pable of governing the kingdom, or of providing for its &s;afety. During his reign the old and terrible enemies, the Danes, who &s;eemed not to be loaded with the &s;ame accumulation of vice and folly as the Engli&s;h, were daily gaining ground. The weakne&s;s and the inexperience of Ethelred appeared to give a favour|able
<PB N="25" REF="28">
opportunity for renewing their depredations; and, accordingly, they landed on &s;everal parts of the coa&s;t, &s;preading their u&s;ual terror and deva&s;tation.</P>
<P>As they lived indi&s;criminately among the Engli&s;h, a re&s;olution was taken for a general ma&s;&s;acre; and Ethelred, by a policy incident to weak princes, em|braced the cruel re&s;olution of putting them all to the &s;word. This plot was carried on with &s;uch &s;ecrecy, that it was executed in one day, and all the Danes in England were de&s;troyed without mercy. But this ma&s;&s;acre &s;o perfidious in the contriving, and &s;o cruel in the execution, in&s;tead of ending the long mi&s;eries of the people, only prepared the way for greater cala|mities.</P>
<P>While the Engli&s;h were yet congratulating each other upon their late deliverance from an inveterate enemy, Sweyn, king of Denmark, who had been in|formed of their treacherous cruelties, appeared off the we&s;tern coa&s;ts with a large fleet, meditating &s;laughter, and furious with revenge. Ethelred was obliged to fly into Normandy, and the whole country thus came under the power of Sweyn, his victorious rival.</P>
<P>Canute, afterwards &s;urnamed the Great, &s;ucceeded Sweyn as king of Denmark, and al&s;o as general of the Dani&s;h forces in England. The conte&s;t be|tween him and Edmund Iron&s;ide, &s;ucce&s;&s;or to Ethel|red, was managed with great ob&s;tinacy and per&s;ever|ance; the fir&s;t battle that was &s;ought appeared un|deci&s;ive; a &s;econd followed, in which the Danes were victorious; but Edmund &s;till having intere&s;t enough to bring a third army into the field, the Dani&s;h and Engli&s;h nobility, equally harra&s;&s;ed by the&s;e convul&s;i|ons, obliged their kings to come to a compromi&s;e, and to divide the kingdom between them by treaty. Canute re&s;erved to him&s;elf the northern parts of the kingdom, the &s;outhern parts were left to Edmund; but this prince being murdered about a month after the treaty by his two chamberlains, at Oxford, Ca|nute
<PB N="26" REF="29">
was left in peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole kingdom.</P>
<P>Canute is repre&s;ented by &s;ome hi&s;torians as one of the fir&s;t characters in tho&s;e barbarous ages. The piety of the latter part of his life, and the re&s;o|lute valour of the former, were topics that filled the mouths of his courtiers with flattery and prai&s;e. They even affected to think his power uncontroulable, and that all things would be obedient to his com|mand. Canute, &s;en&s;ible of their adulation, is &s;aid to have taken the following method to reprove them. He ordered his chair to be &s;et on the &s;ea-&s;hore while the tide was coming in, and commanded the &s;ea to retire. "Thou art under my dominion, cried he; the land upon which I &s;it is mine; I charge thee therefore to approach no farther, nor dare to wet the feet of thy &s;overeign." He feigned to &s;it &s;ome time in expectation of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, till the waves began to &s;urround him: then, turning to his courtiers, he ob&s;erved that the titles of Lord and Ma&s;ter, belonged only to him whom both earth and &s;eas were ready to obey. Thus feared and re&s;pected, he lived many years, honoured with the &s;urname of Great for his power, but de&s;erving it &s;till more for his virtues. He died at Shaft&s;bury, in the nineteenth year of his reign, leaving behind him three &s;ons, Sweyn, Ha|rold, and Hardicnute. Sweyn was crowned king of Norway, Hardicnute was put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Den|mark, and Harold &s;ucceeded his father on the Eng|li&s;h throne.</P>
<P>To Harold &s;ucceeded his brother, Hardicnute, who&s;e title was readily acknowledged both by the Danes and the Engli&s;h; and, upon his arrival from the continent, he was received with the mo&s;t extra|vagant demon&s;trations of joy. This king's violent and unju&s;t government was but of &s;hort duration. He died two years after his acce&s;&s;ion, in con&s;equence
<PB N="27" REF="30">
of exce&s;s at the marriage of a Dani&s;h lord, which was celebrated at Lambeth.</P>
<P>The di&s;orders of the Dani&s;h monarchs once more induced the Engli&s;h to place a monarch of the Sax|on line upon the throne, and accordingly Edward, &s;urnamed the Confe&s;&s;or, was by the general con&s;ent crowned king.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h, who had long groaned under a fo|reign yoke, now &s;et no bounds to their joy, at find|ing the line of their ancient monarchs re&s;tored.</P>
<P>As he had been bred in the Norman court, he &s;hewed, in every in&s;tance, a predilection for the cu&s;|toms, laws, and even the natives of that country; and among the re&s;t of his faults, though he had married Editha, the daughter of Godwin, yet, either from mi&s;taken piety, or fixed aver&s;ion, during his whole reign he ab&s;tained from her bed.</P>
<P>Thus having no legitimate i&s;&s;ue, and being whol|ly engro&s;&s;ed, during the continuance of a long reign, with the vi&s;ions of &s;uper&s;tition, he was at la&s;t &s;ur|prized by &s;ickne&s;s, which brought him to his end, on the fifth of January, in the &s;ixty-fifth year of his age, and twenty-fifth of his reign.</P>
<P>Harold, the &s;on of a popular nobleman, who&s;e name was Godwin, and who&s;e intrigues and virtues &s;eemed to give a right to his preten&s;ions, a&s;cended the throne without any oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>But neither his valour, his ju&s;tice, nor his popula|rity, were able to &s;ecure him from the misfortunes at|tendant upon an ill-grounded title. His preten&s;ions were oppo&s;ed by William duke of Normandy, who in&s;i&s;ted that the crown belonged of right to him, it being bequeathed to him by Edward the Confe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>William, who was afterwards called the Conquer|or, was the natural &s;on of Robert duke of Normandy. His mother's name was Arlette, a beautiful maid of Falaize, whom Robert fell in love with as &s;he &s;tood gazing at her door whil&s;t he pa&s;&s;ed through the
<PB N="28" REF="31">
town. William, who was the offspring of this amour, owed a part of his greatne&s;s to his birth, but &s;till more to his own per&s;onal merit. His body was vigorous, his mind capacious and noble, and his cour|age not to be repre&s;&s;ed by apparent danger. Upon coming to his dukedom of Normandy, though yet very young, he on all &s;ides oppo&s;ed his rebellious &s;ubjects, and repre&s;&s;ed foreign invaders, while his valour and conduct prevailed in every action. The tranquility which he had thus e&s;tabli&s;hed in his do|minions, induced him to extend his views; and &s;ome overtures made him by Edward the Confe&s;&s;or, in the latter part of his reign, who was wavering in the choice of a &s;ucce&s;&s;or, enflamed his ambition with a de&s;ire of &s;ucceeding to the Engli&s;h throne. The pope him&s;elf was not behind the re&s;t in favouring his preten&s;ions; but, either influenced by the apparent ju&s;tice of his claims, or by the hopes of extending the authority of the church, he immediately pro|nounced Harold an u&s;urper. With &s;uch favourable incentives, William &s;oon found him&s;elf at the head of a cho&s;en army of &s;ixty thou&s;and men, all equipped in the mo&s;t warlike and &s;plendid manner. It was in the beginning of &s;ummer that he embarked this pow|erful body on board a fleet of three hundred &s;ail; and, after &s;ome &s;mall oppo&s;ition from the weather, landed at Peven&s;y on the coa&s;t of Su&s;&s;ex, with re&s;olute tran|quility.</P>
<P>Harold, who &s;eemed re&s;olved to defend his right to the crown, and retain that &s;overeignty which he had received from the people, who only had a right to be|&s;tow it, was now returning, flu&s;hed with conque&s;t from defeating the Norwegians, who had invaded the kingdom, with all the forces he had employed in that expedition, and all he could invite or collect in the country through which he pa&s;&s;ed. His army was compo&s;ed of active and valiant troops, in high &s;pirits, &s;trongly attached to their king, and eager to engage.
<PB N="29" REF="32">
On the other hand, the army of William con&s;i&s;ted of the flower of all the continent, and had been long enured to danger. The men of Bretagne, Bologne, Flanders, Poictou, Maine, Orleans, France, and Normandy, were all voluntarily united under his command. England never before, nor never &s;ince, &s;aw two &s;uch armies drawn up to di&s;pute its crown. The day before the battle, William &s;ent an offer to Harold to decide the quarrel between them by &s;ingle combat, and thus to &s;pare the blood of thou&s;ands; but Harold refu&s;ed, and &s;aid, he would leave it to the god of armies to determine. Both armies therefore, that night, pitched in &s;ight of each other, expecting the dawning of the next day with impatience. The Engli&s;h pa&s;|&s;ed the night in &s;ongs and fea&s;ting; the Normans in devotion and prayer.</P>
<P>The next morning, at &s;even, as &s;oon as day appear|ed, both armies were drawn up in array again&s;t each other. Harold appeared in the center of his forces, leading on his army on foot, that his men might be more encouraged, by &s;eeing their king expo&s;ed to an equality of danger. William fought on hor&s;eback, leading on his army that moved at once, &s;inging the &s;ong of Roland, one of the famous chiefs of their country. The Normans began the &s;ight with their cro&s;s-bows, which, at fir&s;t, galled, and &s;urprized the Engli&s;h, and as their ranks were clo&s;e, their ar|rows did great execution. But &s;oon they came to clo|&s;e fight, and the Engli&s;h with their bills, hewed down their adver&s;aries with great &s;laughter. Confu|&s;ion was &s;preading among the ranks, when William, who found him&s;elf on the brink of de&s;truction, ha&s;ten|ed, with a &s;elect band, to the relief of his forces. His pre&s;ence re&s;tored the &s;u&s;pen&s;e of battle; he was &s;een in every place, endeavouring to pierce the ranks of the enemy, and had three hor&s;es &s;lain under him. At length perceiving that the Engli&s;h line continued im|penetrable, he pretended to give ground, which, as
<PB N="30" REF="33">
he expected, drew the enemy from their ranks, and he was in&s;tantly ready to take advantage of their di&s;or|der. Upon a &s;ignal given, the Normans immediately returned to the charge with greater fury than be|fore, broke the Engli&s;h troops, and pur&s;ued them to a ri&s;ing ground. It was in this extremity, that Harold was &s;een flying from rank to rank, rallying and in|&s;piring his troops with vigour; and, though he had toiled all day, till near night-fall, in the front of his Kenti&s;h men, yet he &s;till &s;eemed unabated in force or courage, keeping his men to the po&s;t of honour. Once more, therefore, the victory &s;eemed to turn again&s;t the Normans, and they fell in great numbers, &s;o that the fiercene&s;s and ob&s;tinacy of this memorable battle, was often renewed by the courage of the lead|ers, whenever that of the &s;oldiers began to &s;lacken. Fortune, at length, determined a victory that valour was unable to decide. Harold making a furious on|&s;et at the head of his troops, again&s;t the Norman hea|vy armed infantry, was &s;hot into the brains by an arrow; and his two valiant brothers, fighting by his &s;ide, &s;hared the &s;ame fate. He fell with his &s;word in his hand, amid&s;t heaps of &s;lain, and after the battle, the royal corp&s;e could hardly be di&s;tingui&s;hed among the dead.</P>
<P>This was the end of the Saxon monarchy in En|gland, which had continued for more than &s;ix hun|dred years.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR.</HEAD>
<P>AS &s;oon as William pa&s;&s;ed the Thames, at Wallingford, Stigand the primate, made &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to him in the name of the clergy; and before he came within &s;ight of the city, all the chief nobility came into his camp, and declared an intenti|on of yielding to his authority. William was glad of being thus peaceably put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a throne which &s;everal of his predece&s;&s;ors had not gained without repeated victories.</P>
<P>But in order to give his inva&s;ion all the &s;anction po&s;&s;ible, he was crowned at We&s;tmin&s;ter by the archbi&s;hop of York, and took the oath u&s;ual in the times of the Saxon and Dani&s;h kings, which was, to protect and defend the church, to ob&s;erve the laws of the realm, and to govern the people with impartiality. Having thus &s;ecured the government, and, by a mix|ture of vigour and lenity brought the Engli&s;h to an entire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, he re&s;olved to return to the con|tinent, there to enjoy the triumph and congratula|tion of his ancient &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the ab&s;ence of the Conqueror in England produced the mo&s;t fatal effects. His offi|cers being no longer controlled by his ju&s;tice, thought this a fit opportunity for extortion; while the Engli&s;h, no longer awed by his pre&s;ence, thought it the happie&s;t occa&s;ion for vindicating their freedom.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h had entered into a con&s;piracy to cut off their invaders, and fixed the day for their intended ma&s;&s;acre, which was to be on A&s;h-Wedne&s;day, du|ring the time of divine &s;ervice, when all the Nor|mans would be unarmed as penitents, according to the di&s;cipline of the times. But William's return quickly
<PB N="32" REF="35">
di&s;concerted all their &s;chemes. And from that time forward he began to lo&s;e all confidence in his Eng|li&s;h &s;ubjects, and to regard them as inveterate and ir|reconcileable enemies. He had already rai&s;ed &s;uch a number of fortre&s;&s;es in the kingdom, that he no lon|ger dreaded the tumultuous or tran&s;ient efforts of a di&s;contented multitude; he therefore determined to treat them as a conquered nation, to indulge his own ava|rice, and that of his followers, by numerous confi&s;ca|tions, and to &s;ecure his power by humbling all who were able to make any re&s;i&s;tance. He proceeded to con|fi&s;cate all the e&s;tates of the Engli&s;h gentry, and to grant them liberally to his Norman followers. Thus all the ancient and honourable families were reduced to beggary, and the Engli&s;h found them&s;elves entire|ly excluded from every road that led either to honour or preferment.</P>
<P>To keep the clergy as much as po&s;&s;ible in his inte|re&s;ts, he appointed none but his own countrymen to the mo&s;t con&s;iderable church-dignities, and even di&s;|placed Stigand archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, upon &s;ome frivolous pretences.</P>
<P>William, having cru&s;hed &s;everal con&s;piracies, and by puni&s;hing the malecontents, thus &s;ecured the peace of his dominions, now expected re&s;t from his labours; and finding none either willing or powerful enough to oppo&s;e him, he hoped that the end of his reign would be marked with pro&s;perity and peace. But &s;uch is the blindne&s;s of human hope, that he found enemies where he lea&s;t expected them, and &s;uch too as &s;erved to embitter all the latter part of his life. His la&s;t troubles were excited by his own chil|dren, from the oppo&s;ing of whom he could expect to reap neither glory nor gain. He had three &s;ons, Ro|bert, William and Henry, be&s;ides &s;everal daughters. Robert, his elde&s;t &s;on, &s;urnamed Curtho&s;e, from the &s;hortne&s;s of his legs, was a prince who inherited all the bravery of his family and nation, but was rather
<PB N="33" REF="36">
bold than prudent; and was often heard to expre&s;s his jealou&s;y of his two brothers, William and Henry. The&s;e, by greater a&s;&s;iduity, had wrought upon the credulity and affections of the king, and con&s;equent|ly were the more obnoxious to Robert. A mind, therefore, &s;o well prepared for re&s;entment, &s;oon found or made a cau&s;e for an open rupture. The princes were one day in &s;port together, and in the idle petu lance of play, took it into their head to throw water upon their elder brother as he pa&s;&s;ed through the court, on leaving their apartment. Robert, all alive to &s;u&s;picion, quickly turned this frolic into a &s;tudied indignity; and having the&s;e jealou&s;ies &s;till farther enflamed by one of his favourites, he drew his &s;word, and ran up &s;tairs with an intent to take revenge. The whole ca&s;tle was quickly filled with tumult, and it was not without &s;ome difficulty, that the king him&s;elf was able to appea&s;e it. But he could not allay the animo&s;ity, which from that moment, ever after prevailed in his family. Robert, attended by &s;everal of his confederates, withdrew to Rouen that very night, hoping to &s;urprize the ca&s;tle, but his de&s;ign was defeated by the governor.</P>
<P>The flame being thus kindled, the popular charac|ter of the prince, and a &s;ympathy of manners, engaged all the young nobility of Normandy and Maine, as well as of Anjou and Brittany, to e&s;pou&s;e his quarrel; even his mother, it is &s;aid, &s;upported him by &s;ecret remittances, and aided him in this ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance by private encouragement. This unnatural conte&s;t continued for &s;everal years to enflame the Norman &s;tate; and William was at la&s;t obliged to have recour&s;e to England for &s;upporting his authority again&s;t his &s;on. Accordingly drawing an army of Engli&s;hmen toge|ther, he led them over into Normandy, where he &s;oon compelled Robert and his adherents to quit the field, and he was quickly rein&s;tated in all his domi|nions.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="37">William had &s;carcely put an end to this tran&s;action, when he felt a very &s;evere blow in the death of Ma|tilda, his queen; and, as misfortunes generally come together, he received information of a general in&s;urrection in Maine, the nobility of which had been always aver&s;e to the Norman government. Up|on his arrival on the continent, he found, that the in|&s;urgents had been &s;ecretly a&s;&s;i&s;ted and excited by the king of France, who&s;e policy con&s;i&s;ted in thus le&s;|&s;ening the Norman power, by creating di&s;&s;entions among the nobles of its different provinces. William's di&s;plea&s;ure was not a little increa&s;ed by the account he received of &s;ome railleries which that monarch had thrown out again&s;t him. It &s;eems that William, who was become corpulent, had been detained in bed &s;ome time by &s;ickne&s;s; and Philip was heard to &s;ay, that he only lay in of a big belly. This &s;o provoked the Engli&s;h monarch, that he &s;ent him word, he would &s;oon be up, and would at his churching pre|&s;ent &s;uch a number of tapers, as would &s;et the king|dom of France in a flame.</P>
<P>In order to perform this promi&s;e, he levied a &s;trong army, and entering the i&s;le of France, de|&s;troyed and burned all the villages and hou&s;es without oppo&s;ition, and took the town of Mante, which he reduced to a&s;hes. But the progre&s;s of the&s;e ho&s;tilities was &s;topped by an accident which &s;hortly after put an end to William's life. His hor&s;e chancing to place his fore-feet on &s;ome hot a&s;hes, plunged &s;o vio|lently, that the rider was thrown forward, and brui&s;ed upon the pummel of the &s;addle to &s;uch a degree that he &s;uffered a relap&s;e, of which he died &s;hortly after at a little village near Rouen.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. WILLIAM RUFUS.</HEAD>
<P>WILLIAM, &s;urnamed RUFUS, from the colour of his hair, was appointed by the king's will, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, while the elder &s;on, Robert, was left in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Normandy. Neverthele&s;s, the Norman barons were, from the beginning, di&s;|plea&s;ed at the divi&s;ion of the empire by the late king; they eagerly de&s;ired an union as before, and looked upon Robert as the proper owner of the whole. A powerful con&s;piracy was therefore carried on again&s;t William; and Odo, the late king's brother, under|took to conduct it to maturity.</P>
<P>William, &s;en&s;ible of the danger that threatened him, endeavoured to gain the affections of the native Eng|li&s;h, whom he prevailed upon by promi&s;es of future good treatment, and preference in the di&s;tribution of his favours, to e&s;pou&s;e his intere&s;ts. He was &s;oon therefore in the field; and at the head of a numerous army, &s;hewed him&s;elf in readine&s;s to oppo&s;e all who &s;hould di&s;pute his preten&s;ions. In the mean time, Robert in&s;tead of employing his money in levies, to &s;upport his friends in England, &s;quandered it away in idle expences, and unmerited benefits, &s;o that he procra&s;tinated his departure till the opportunity was lo&s;t; while William exerted him&s;elf with incredible activity to di&s;&s;ipate the confederacy before his brother could arrive. Nor was this difficult to effect: the con&s;pirators had in con&s;equence of Robert's a&s;|&s;urances, taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome fortre&s;&s;es; but the appearance of the king, &s;oon reduced them to implore for mercy. He granted them their lives but confi&s;cated all their e&s;tates, and bani&s;hed them the kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="39">A new breach was made &s;ome time after between the brothers, in which Rufus found means to en|croach &s;till farther upon Robert's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. Every con&s;piracy thus detected, &s;erved to enrich the king, who took care to apply to his own u&s;e tho&s;e trea&s;ures which had been ama&s;&s;ed for the purpo&s;e of dethroning him.</P>
<P>But the memory of the&s;e tran&s;ient broils and un&s;uc|ce&s;sful trea&s;ons, were now totally eclip&s;ed by one of the mo&s;t noted enterprizes that ever adorned the an|nals of nations, or excited the attention of mankind. I mean the Cru&s;ades, which were now fir&s;t project|ed. Peter the Hermit, a native of Amiens in Pi|cardy, was a man of great zeal, courage, and piety. He had made a pilgrimage to the holy &s;epulchre at Je|ru&s;alem, and beheld, with indignation, the cruel manner in which the Chri&s;tians were treated by the Infidels, who were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that place. He preached the cru&s;ade over Europe by the Pope's per|mi&s;&s;ion, and men of all ranks &s;lew to arms with the utmo&s;t alacrity, to re&s;cue the Holy Land from the In|fidels, and each bore the &s;ign of the cro&s;s upon their right &s;houlder, as a mark of their devotion to the cau&s;e. In the mid&s;t of this univer&s;al ardour that was diffu&s;ed over Europe, men were not entirely forgetful of their temporal intere&s;ts; for &s;ome, hoping a more magnificent &s;ettlement in the &s;oft regions of A&s;ia, &s;old their European property for whatever they could obtain, contented with receiving any thing for what they were predetermined to relinqui&s;h. Among the princes who felt and acknowledged this general &s;pirit of enterprize, was Robert duke of Normandy. The Cru&s;ade was entirely adapted to his inclinations, and his circum&s;tances; he was brave, zealous, co|vetous of glory, poor, harra&s;&s;ed by in&s;urrections, and, what was more than all, naturally fond of change. In order, therefore, to &s;upply money to defray the nece&s;&s;ary charges of &s;o expen&s;ive an undertaking, he
<PB N="37" REF="40">
offered to mortgage his dukedom of Normandy to his brother Rufus for a &s;tipulated &s;um of money. This &s;um, which was no greater than ten thou&s;and marks, was readily promi&s;ed by Rufus, who&s;e ambi|tion was upon the watch to &s;eize every advantage.</P>
<P>But though the ce&s;&s;ation of Maine and Normandy, greatly increa&s;ed the king's territories, they added but little to his real power, as his new &s;ubjects were compo&s;ed of men of independent &s;pirits, more ready to di&s;pute than to obey his commands. Many were the revolts and in&s;urrections which he was obliged to quell in per&s;on; and no &s;ooner was one con&s;piracy &s;uppre&s;&s;ed than another ro&s;e to give him fre&s;h di&s;|quietude.</P>
<P>However Rufus proceeded, carele&s;s of approbation or cen&s;ure; and only intent upon extending his domi|nions, either by purcha&s;e or conque&s;t. The earl of Poictiers and Guienne, enflamed with a de&s;ire of going upon the Cru&s;ade, had gather|ed an immen&s;e multitude for that expedition, but wanted money to forward his preparations. He had recour&s;e, therefore, to Rufus; and offered to mort|gage all his dominions, without much con&s;idering what would become of his unhappy &s;ubjects that he thus di&s;po&s;ed of. The king accepted this offer with his u&s;ual avidity; and had prepared a fleet, and an army, in order to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, of the rich pro|vinces thus con&s;igned to his tru&s;t. But an accident put an end to all his ambitious projects; he was &s;hot by an arrow that Sir Walter Tyrrel di&s;charged at a deer in the New Fore&s;t, which glancing from a tree, &s;truck the king to the heart. He dropt dead in&s;tantaneou&s;ly; while the innocent author of his death, terrified at the accident, put &s;purs to his hor&s;e, ha&s;tened to the &s;ea-&s;hore, embarked for France, and joined the Cru&s;ade that was then &s;etting out for Jeru|&s;alem.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. HENRY I. &s;urnamed BEAUCLERC.</HEAD>
<P>HENRY, the late king's younger brother, who had been hunting in the New Fore&s;t, when Rufus was &s;lain, took the earlie&s;t advantage of the occa&s;ion, and ha&s;tening to Winche&s;|ter, re&s;olved to &s;ecure the royal trea&s;ure, which he knew to be the be&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tant in &s;econding his aims.

<P>Henry, to ingratiate him&s;elf with the people, ex|pelled from court all the mini&s;ters of his brother's de|bauchery and arbitrary power. One thing only re|mained to confirm his claims without danger of a rival. The Engli&s;h &s;till remembered their Saxon mo|narchs with gratitude, and beheld them excluded the throne with regret. There &s;till remained &s;ome of the de&s;cendants of that favourite line; and, among others, Matilda, the niece of Edgar Atheling, which lady, having declined all preten&s;ions to royalty, was bred up in a convent, and had actually taken the veil. Upon her Henry fir&s;t fixed his eyes as a proper con|&s;ort, by who&s;e means, the long breach between the Saxon and Norman intere&s;ts would be finally united. It only remained to get over the &s;cruple of her being a nun: but this a council, devoted to his intere&s;ts, readily admitted; and Matilda being pronounced free to marry, the nuptials were celebrated with great pomp and &s;olemnity.</P>
<P>It was at this unfavourable juncture, that Robert returned from abroad, and after taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="39" REF="42">
his native dominions, laid his claim to the crown of England. But, propo&s;als for an accommodation being made, it was &s;tipulated, that Robert, upon the pay|ment of a certain &s;um, &s;hould re&s;ign his preten&s;ions to England; and that if either of the princes died without i&s;&s;ue, the other &s;hould &s;ucceed to his domi|nions. This treaty being ratified, the armies on each &s;ide were di&s;banded; and Robert, having lived two months in the utmo&s;t harmony with his brother, re|turned in peacc to his own dominions.</P>
<P>But Robert's indi&s;cretion &s;oon rendered him unfit to govern any &s;tate: he was totally aver&s;e to bu&s;ine&s;s, and only &s;tudious of the more &s;plendid amu&s;ements or employments of life. His &s;ervants pillaged him without compunction; and he is de&s;cribed as lying whole days a-bed for want of cloaths, of which they had robbed him. His &s;ubjects were treated &s;till more deplorably, for being under the command of petty and rapacious tyrants, who plundered them without mercy, the whole country was become a &s;cene of vio|lence and depredation. It was in this mi&s;erable exi|gence, that the Normans at length had recour&s;e to Henry, from who&s;e wi&s;e admini&s;tration of his own dominions, they expected a &s;imilitude of pro&s;perity, &s;hould he take the reins of theirs. Henry very readily promi&s;ed to redre&s;s their grievances, as he knew it would be the direct method to &s;econd his own ambition. The year en&s;uing, therefore, he landed in Normandy with a &s;trong army, took &s;ome of the principal towns; and a battle en&s;u|ing, Robert's forces were totally overthrown, and he him&s;elf taken pri&s;oner, with near ten thou&s;and of his men, and all the con&s;iderable barons who had adhered to his misfortunes. This victory was fol|lowed by the final reduction of Normandy, while Henry returned in triumph to England, leading with him his captive brother, who, after a life of bravery, genero&s;ity, and truth, now found him&s;elf not only
<PB N="40" REF="43">
deprived of his patrimony and his friends, but al&s;o of his freedom. Henry, unmindful of his brother's for|mer magnanimity with regard to him, detained him a pri&s;oner during the remainder of his life, which was no le&s;s than twenty-eight years; and he died in the ca&s;tle of Cardiff, in Glamorgan&s;hire. It is even &s;aid by &s;ome, that he was deprived of his &s;ight by a red|hot copper ba&s;on applied to his eyes; while his bro|ther attempted to &s;tifle the reproaches of his con|&s;cience, by founding the abbey of Reading, which was then con&s;idered as a &s;ufficient atonement for every degree of barbarity.</P>
<P>Fortune now &s;eemed to &s;mile upon Henry, and promi&s;e a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of felicity. He was in peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of two powerful &s;tates, and had a &s;on who was acknowledged undi&s;puted heir, arrived at his eighteenth year, whom he loved mo&s;t tenderly. His daughter, Matilda, was al&s;o married to the empe|ror Henry V. of Germany, and &s;he had been &s;ent to that court while yet but eight years old, for her edu|cation. All his pro&s;pects, however, were at once clouded by unfore&s;een misfortunes and accidents, which tinctured his remaining years with mi&s;ery. The king, from the facility with which he u&s;urped the crown, dreading that his family might be &s;ubvert|ed with the &s;ame ea&s;e, took care to have his &s;on re|cognized as his &s;ucce&s;&s;or by the &s;tates of England, and carried him over to Normandy to receive the homage of the barons of that duchy. After performing this requi&s;ite ceremony, Henry, returning triumphantly to England, brought with him a numerous retinue of the chief nobility, who &s;eemed to &s;hare in his &s;ucce&s;|&s;es. In one of the ve&s;&s;els of the fleet, his &s;on, and &s;e|veral young noblemen, the companions of his plea|&s;ures, went together to render the pa&s;&s;age more agree|able. The king &s;et &s;ail for Barfleur, and was &s;oon carried by a fair wind out of &s;ight of land. The prince was detained by &s;ome accident; and his &s;ailors, as
<PB N="41" REF="44">
well as their captain, Fitz-Stephen, having &s;pent the interval in drinking, became &s;o di&s;ordered, that they ran the &s;hip upon a rock, and immediately it was da&s;h|ed to pieces. The prince was put into the boat, and might have e&s;caped, had he not been called back by the cries of Maude, his natural &s;i&s;ter. He was at fir&s;t conveyed out of danger him&s;elf, but could not leave a per&s;on &s;o dear to peri&s;h without an effort to &s;ave her. He, therefore, prevailed upon the &s;ailors to row back and take her in. The approach of the boat, giv|ing &s;everal others, who had been left upon the wreck, the hopes of &s;aving their lives, numbers leaped in, and the whole went to the bottom. Above an hun|dred and forty young noblemen of the principal fami|lies of England and Normandy, were lo&s;t on this oc|ca&s;ion. A butcher of Rouen was the only per&s;on on board who e&s;caped; he clung to the ma&s;t, and was taken up the next morning by &s;ome fi&s;hermen. Fitz-Stephen, the captain, while the butcher was thus buf|fetting the waves for his life, &s;wam up to him, and en|quired if the prince was yet living; when being told that he had peri&s;hed, then I will not out-live him, &s;aid the captain, and immediately &s;unk to the bottom. The &s;hrieks of the&s;e unfortunate people were heard from the &s;hore, and the noi&s;e even reached the king's &s;hip, but the cau&s;e was then unknown. Henry en|tertained hopes for three days, that his &s;on had put into &s;ome di&s;tant port of England; but when cer|tain intelligence of the calamity was brought him, he fainted away, and was never &s;een to &s;mile from that moment to the day of his death, which followed &s;ome time after at St. Dennis, a little town in Nor|mandy, from eating too plentiful of lampreys, a di&s;h he was particularly fond of. He died in the &s;ixty-&s;e|venth year of his age, and the thirty-fifth of his reign, leaving by will, his daughther Matilda, heire&s;s of all his dominions.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. STEPHEN.</HEAD>
<P>NO &s;ooner was the king known to be dead, than Stephen, &s;on of Adela, the king's &s;i&s;ter, and the count of Blois, con&s;cious of his own power and in|fluence, re&s;olved to &s;ecure to him&s;elf the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what he &s;o long de&s;ired. He immediately ha&s;tened from Normandy, and arriving at London, was imme|diately &s;aluted king by all the lower ranks of peo|ple. Being thus &s;ecured of the people, his next &s;tep was to gain over the clergy; and, for that purpo&s;e, his brother, the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, exerted all his influence among them, with good &s;ucce&s;s. Thus was Stephen made king, by one of tho&s;e &s;peedy revolu|tions which ever mark the barbarity of a &s;tate in which they are cu&s;tomary.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t acts of an u&s;urper are always popular. Stephen, in order to &s;ecure his tottering throne, pa&s;&s;ed a charter, granting &s;everal privileges to the different orders of the &s;tate. To the nobility, a permi&s;&s;ion to hunt in their own fore&s;ts; to the clergy, a &s;peedy fill|ing of all vacant benefices; and to the people, a re&s;|toration of the laws of Edward the Confe&s;&s;or. To fix him&s;elf &s;till more &s;ecurely, he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the royal trea&s;ures at Winche&s;ter, and had his title rati|fied by the pope with a part of the money.</P>
<P>It was not long, however, that Matilda delayed a&s;|&s;erting her claim to the crown. She landed upon the coa&s;t of Su&s;&s;ex, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Robert, earl of Glou|ce&s;ter, natural &s;on to the late king. The whole of Matilda's retinue, upon this occa&s;ion, amounted to no more than an hundred and forty knights, who imme|diately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Arundel ca&s;tle; but the na|ture of her claims &s;oon encrea&s;ed the number of her
<PB N="43" REF="46">
partizans, and her forces every day &s;eemed to gain ground upon tho&s;e of her antagoni&s;t. Mean time Stephen, being a&s;&s;ured of her arrival, flew to be&s;iege Arundel, where &s;he had taken refuge, and where &s;he was protected by the queen dowager, who &s;ecretly favoured her preten&s;ions. This fortre&s;s was too feeble to promi&s;e a long defence; and would have been &s;oon taken, had it not been repre&s;ented to the king, that, as it was a ca&s;tle belonging to the queen dowager, it would be an infringement on the re&s;pect due to her to attempt taking it by force. There was a &s;pirit of ge|nero&s;ity mixed with the rudene&s;s of the times, that unaccountably prevailed in many tran&s;actions; Ste|phen permitted Matilda to come forth in &s;afety, and had her conveyed with &s;ecurity to Bri&s;tol, another fortre&s;s equally &s;trong with that from whence he per|mitted her to retire. It would be tedious to relate the various &s;kirmi&s;hes on either &s;ide, in pur&s;uance of their re&s;pective preten&s;ions; it will &s;uffice to &s;ay, that Matilda's forces encrea&s;ed every day, while her antagoni&s;t &s;eemed every hour to become weaker, and a victory gained by the queen threw Stephen from the throne, and exalted Matilda in his room. Ma|tilda was crowned at Winche&s;ter with all imaginable &s;elemnity.</P>
<P>Matilda, however, was unfit for government. She affected to treat the nobility with a degree of di&s;|dain, to which they had long been unaccu&s;tomed; &s;o that the fickle nation once more began to pity their depo&s;ed king, and to repent the &s;teps they had taken in her favour. The bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter was not re|mi&s;s in &s;omenting the&s;e di&s;contents; and when he found the people ripe for a tumult, detached a party of his friends and va&s;&s;als to block up the city of Lon|don, where the queen then re&s;ided. At the &s;ame time, mea&s;ures were taken to in&s;tigate the Londoners to a revolt, and to &s;eize her per&s;on. Matilda having timely notice of this con&s;piracy, fled to Winche&s;ter,
<PB N="44" REF="47">
whither the bi&s;hop, &s;till her &s;ecret enemy, followed her, watching an opportunity to ruin her cau&s;e. His party was &s;oon &s;ufficiently &s;trong to bid the queen open defiance; and to be&s;iege her in the very place where &s;he fir&s;t received his benediction. There &s;he continued for &s;ome time, but the town being pre&s;&s;ed by famine, &s;he was obliged to e&s;cape, while her bro|ther, the earl of Glouce&s;ter, endeavouring to follow, was taken pri&s;oner, and exchanged for Stephen, who &s;till continued a captive. Thus a &s;udden revolution once more took place; Matilda was depo&s;ed, and obliged to &s;eek for &s;afety in Oxford. Stephen was again recognized as king, and taken from his dun|geon to be placed on the throne!</P>
<P>But he was now to enter the li&s;ts with a new op|po&s;er, who was every day coming to maturity, and growing more formidable. This was Henry, the &s;on of Matilda, who had now reached his &s;ixteenth year; and gave the greate&s;t hopes of being one day a valiant leader, and a con&s;ummate politician.</P>
<P>With the wi&s;hes of the people in his favour, young Henry was re&s;olved to reclaim his hereditary king|dom&punc; and to di&s;pute once more Stephen's u&s;urped preten&s;ions, and accordingly made an inva&s;ion on England, where he was immediately joined by almo&s;t all the barons of the kingdom.</P>
<P>In the mean time Stephen, alarmed at the power and popularity of his young rival, tried every method to anticipate the purpo&s;e of his inva&s;ion; but find|ing it impo&s;&s;ible to turn the torrent, he was oblig|ed to have recour&s;e to treaty. It was, therefore, agreed by all parties, that Stephen &s;hould reign during his life; and that ju&s;tice &s;hould be admini&s;tered in his name. That Henry &s;hould, on Stephen's death, &s;ucceed to the kingdom; and William, Stephen's &s;on, &s;hould inherit Boulogne and his patrimonial e&s;tate. After all the barons had &s;worn to this treaty, which filled the whole kingdom with joy, Henry evacuated
<PB N="45" REF="48">
England; and Stephen returned to the peaceable en|joyment of his throne. His reign, however, was &s;oon after terminated by his death, which happened about a year after the treaty, at Canterbury, where he was interred.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. HENRY II.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t act of Henry's government gave the people an happy omen of his future wi&s;e admi|ni&s;tration. Con&s;cious of his power, he began to cor|rect tho&s;e abu&s;es, and to re&s;ume tho&s;e privileges, which had been extorted from the weakne&s;s or the credulity of his predece&s;&s;ors. He immediately di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed all tho&s;e mercenary &s;oldiers who committed in|finite di&s;orders in the nation. He re&s;umed many of tho&s;e benefactions which had been made to churches and mona&s;teries in the former reigns. He gave char|ters to &s;everal towns, by which the citizens claimed their freedom and privileges, independent of any &s;u|perior but him&s;elf. The&s;e charters were the ground|work of Engli&s;h liberty. The &s;truggles which had before this time been, whether the king or the barons, or the clergy, &s;hould be de&s;potic over the people, now began to a&s;&s;ume a new a&s;pect; and a fourth order, namely, that of the more opulent of the peo|ple, began to claim a &s;hare in admini&s;tration. Thus was the feudal government at fir&s;t impaired; and liberty began to be more equally diffu&s;ed throughout the nation.</P>
<P>Henry being thus become the mo&s;t powerful prince of his age, the undi&s;puted monarch of England, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> more than a third of France, and having humbled the barons that would circum&s;cribe his pow|er, he might naturally be expected to reign with
<PB N="46" REF="49">
very little oppo&s;ition for the future. But it happened otherwi&s;e. He found the &s;evere&s;t mortifications from a quarter where he lea&s;t expected re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The famous Thomas a Becket, the fir&s;t man of Engli&s;h extraction, who had &s;ince the Norman con|que&s;t, ri&s;en to any &s;hare of power, was the &s;on of a citizen of London. Having received his early edu|cation in the &s;chools of that metropolis, he re&s;ided &s;ome time at Paris; and on his return became clerk in the &s;heriff's office. From that humble &s;tation he ro&s;e through the gradations of office, until at la&s;t he was made archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, a dignity &s;e|cond only to that of the king.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was he fixed in this high &s;tation, which rendered him for life the &s;econd per&s;on in the king|dom, than he endeavoured to retrieve the character of &s;anctity, which his former levities might have appear|ed to oppo&s;e. He was in his per&s;on the mo&s;t mortifi|ed man that could be &s;een. He wore &s;ackcloth next his &s;kin. He changed it &s;o &s;eldom, that it was filled with dirt and vermin. His u&s;ual diet was bread, his drink water; which he rendered further unpalatable, by the mixture of unfavoury herbs. His back was mangled with frequent di&s;cipline. He every day wa&s;hed on his knees the feet of thirteen beggars. Thus pretending to &s;anctity, he &s;et up for being a de|fender of the privileges of the clergy, which had for a long time become enormous, and which it was Henry's aim to abridge.</P>
<P>An opportunity &s;oon offered, that gave him a popular pretext for beginning his intended reforma|tion. A man in holy orders had debauched the daughter of a gentleman in Worce&s;ter&s;hire; and then murdered the father, to prevent the effects of his re&s;entment. The atrociou&s;ne&s;s of the crime produ|ced a &s;pirit of indignation among the people; and the king in&s;i&s;ted that the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in &s;hould be tried by
<PB N="47" REF="50">
the civil magi&s;trate. This Becket oppo&s;ed, alledging the privileges of the church.</P>
<P>In order to determine this matter, the king &s;um|moned a general council of the nobility and prelates at Clarendon, to whom he &s;ubmitted this great and important affair, and de&s;ired their concurrence. The&s;e councils &s;eem at that time convened rather to give authenticity to the king's decrees, than to enact laws that were to bind their po&s;terity. A number of regulations were there drawn up, which were after|wards well known under the title of the Con&s;titutions of Clarendon, and were then voted without oppo&s;ition. By the&s;e regulations, it was enacted, that clergymen accu&s;ed of any crime &s;hould be tried in the civil courts; that laymen &s;hould not be tried in the &s;piritual courts, except by legal and reputable wit|ne&s;&s;es. The&s;e with &s;ome others of le&s;s con&s;equence, or implied in the above to the number of &s;ixteen, were readily &s;ub&s;cribed to by all the bi&s;hops pre&s;ent; Becket him&s;elf, who at fir&s;t &s;hewed &s;ome reluctance, added his name to the number. But Alexander, who was then pope, condemned them in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, abrogated, annulled, and rejected them.</P>
<P>This produced a conte&s;t between the king and Becket, who having attained the highe&s;t honours the monarch could be&s;tow, took part with his holine&s;s. In the mid&s;t of this di&s;pute Becket, with an intrepidity peculiar to him&s;elf, arraying him&s;elf in his epi&s;copal ve&s;tments, and with the cro&s;s in his hand, went for|ward to the king's palace, and entering the royal apartments, &s;ate down, holding up the cro&s;s as his banner of protection. There he put him&s;elf, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, under the protection of the &s;u|preme pontiff; and upon receiving a refu&s;al to leave the kindom, he &s;ecretly withdrew in di&s;gui&s;e, and at la&s;t &s;ound means to cro&s;s over to the conti|nent.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="51">The intrepidity of Becket, joined to his apparent &s;anctity, gained him a very favourable reception up|on the continent, both from the people and their go|vernors.</P>
<P>The pope and he were not remi&s;s to retort their ful|minations, and to &s;hake the very foundation of the king's authority. Becket compared him&s;elf to Chri&s;t, who had been condemned by a lay tribunal; and who was crucified a-new in the pre&s;ent oppre&s;&s;ions un|der which the church laboured. But he did not re&s;t in complaints only. He i&s;&s;ued out a cen&s;ure, excommunicating the king's chief mini&s;ters by name, all that were concerned in &s;eque&s;tring the revenues of his &s;ee, and all who obeyed or favoured the con|&s;titutions of Clarendon.</P>
<P>Frequent attempts, indeed, were made towards an accommodation; but the mutual jealou&s;ies that each bore to the other, and their anxiety not to lo&s;e the lea&s;t advantage in the negociation, often protract|ed this de&s;irable treaty.</P>
<P>At length, however, the mutual aim of both made a reconciliation nece&s;&s;ary; but nothing could exceed the in&s;olence with which Becket conducted him&s;elf upon his fir&s;t landing in England. In&s;tead of re|tiring quietly to his dioce&s;e, with that mode&s;ty which became a man ju&s;t pardoned by his king, he made a progre&s;s through Kent, in all the &s;plendor and magni|ficence of a &s;overeign pontiff. As he approached South|wark, the clergy, the laity, men of all ranks and ages, came forth to meet him, and celebrated his triumphal entry with hymns of joy. Thus, confident of the voice and the hearts of the people, he began to launch forth his thunders again&s;t tho&s;e who had been his former oppo&s;ers. The archbi&s;hop of York, who had crowned Henry's-elde&s;t &s;on in his ab|&s;ence, was the fir&s;t again&s;t whom he denounced &s;en|tence of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion. The bi&s;hops of London and Sali&s;bury he actually excommunicated. One man
<PB N="49" REF="52">
he excommunicated for having &s;poken again&s;t him; and another, for having cut off the tail of one of his hor&s;es.</P>
<P>Henry was then in Normandy, while the pri|mate was thus triumphantly parading through the kingdom; and it was not without the utmo&s;t in|dignation that he received information of his turbu|lent in&s;olence. When the &s;u&s;pended and excom|municated prelates arrived with their complaints, his anger knew no bounds. He broke forth into the mo&s;t acrimonious expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t that arrogant churchman, whom he had rai&s;ed from the lowe&s;t &s;tation, to be the plague of his life, and the conti|nual di&s;turber of his government. The archbi&s;hop of York remarked to him, that &s;o long as Becket lived, he could never expect to enjoy peace or tran|quility; and the king him&s;elf bur&s;t out into an ex|clamation, that he had no friends about him, or he would not &s;o long have been expo&s;ed to the in&s;ults of that ungrateful hypocrite. The&s;e words excited the at|tention of the whole court; and armed four of his mo&s;t re&s;olute attendants, to gratify their monarch's &s;ecret inclinations. The con&s;pirators being joined by &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tants at the place of their meeting, proceeded to Canterbury with all that ha&s;te their bloody inten|tions required. Advancing directly to Becket's hou&s;e, and entering his apartment, they reproached him very fiercely for the ra&s;hne&s;s and the in&s;olence of his con|duct. During their altercation, the time approached for Becket to a&s;&s;i&s;t at ve&s;pers, whither he went un|guarded, the con&s;pirators following and preparing for their attempt. As &s;oon as he had reached the altar, where it is ju&s;t to think he a&s;pired at the glory of martyrdom, they all fell upon him; and having cloven his head with repeated blows, he dropt down dead before the altar of St. Benedict, which was be|&s;meared with his blood and brains.</P>

<P><PB N="50" REF="55">Nothing could exceed the king's con&s;ternation up|on receiving the fir&s;t news of this prelate's cata&s;|trophe. He was in&s;tantly &s;en&s;ible that the murder would be ultimately imputed to him; and at length, in order to divert the minds of the people to a different object, he undertook an expedition again&s;t Ireland.</P>
<P>Ireland was at that time in pretty much the &s;ame &s;ituation that England had been, after the fir&s;t in|va&s;ion of the Saxons. They had been early con|verted to Chri&s;tianity; and, for three or four centu|ries after, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a very large proportion of the learn|ing of the times. Being undi&s;turbed by foreign in|va&s;ions, and perhaps too poor to invite the rapacity of conquerors, they enjoyed a peaceful life, which they gave up to piety, and &s;uch learning as was then thought nece&s;&s;ary to promote it. Of their learning, their arts, their piety, and even their poli&s;hed man|ners, too many monuments remain to this day for us to make the lea&s;t doubt concerning them; but it is equally true, that in time they fell from the&s;e advantages; and their degenerate po&s;terity, at the period we are now &s;peaking of, were wrapt in the darke&s;t barbarity.</P>
<P>At the time when Henry fir&s;t planned the in|va&s;ion of the i&s;land, it was divided into five prin|cipalities, namely, Lein&s;ter, Meath, Mun&s;ter, Ul|&s;ter, and Connaught; each governed by its re&s;pec|tive monarch. As it had been u&s;ual for one or other of tho&s;e to take the lead in their wars, he was deno|minated &s;ole monarch of the kingdom, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a power re&s;embling that of the early Saxon mo|narchs in England. Roderic O Connor, king of Connaught, was then advanced to this dignity, and Dermot M'Morrogh was king of Lein&s;ter. This la&s;t named prince, a weak, licentious tyrant, had carried off and ravi&s;hed the daughter of the king of Meath, who being &s;trengthened by the alliance of the king
<PB N="51" REF="56">
of Connaught, invaded the ravi&s;her's dominions, and expelled him from his kingdom. This prince, thus ju&s;tly puni&s;hed, had recour&s;e to Henry, who was at that time in Guienne; and offered to hold his king|dom of the Engli&s;h crown, in ca&s;e he recovered it by the king's a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Henry readily accepted the offer; but being at that time embarra&s;&s;ed by more near intere&s;ts, he only gave Dermot letters patent, by which he empowered all his &s;ubjects to aid the Iri&s;h prince in the recovery of his dominions. Der|mot, relying on this authority, returned to Bri&s;tol, where, after &s;ome difficulty, he formed a treaty with Richard, &s;urnamed Strongbow, earl of Pembroke, who agreed to re-in&s;tate him in his dominions, upon condition of his being married to his daughter Eva, and declared heir of all his territory. Being thus a&s;|&s;ured of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he returned privately to Ireland, and concealed him&s;elf during the winter, in the mo|na&s;tery of Ferns, which he had founded. Robert Fitz&s;tephens was the fir&s;t knight who was able, the en&s;uing &s;pring, to fulfil his engagements, by landing with an hundred and thirty knights, &s;ixty e&s;quires, and three hundred archers. They were &s;oon after joined by Maurice Penderga&s;t, who, about the &s;ame time, brought over ten knights, and &s;ixty archers; and with this &s;mall body of forces they re&s;olved on be&s;ieging Wexford, which was to be theirs by treaty. This town was quickly reduced; and the adventu|rers being reinforced by another body of men to the amount of an hundred and fifty, under the com|mand of Maurice Fitzgerald, compo&s;ed an army that &s;truck the barbarous natives with awe. Roderic, the chief monarch of the i&s;land, ventured to oppo&s;e them, but he was defeated; and &s;oon after the prince of O&s;&s;ory was obliged to &s;ubmit, and give ho&s;tages for his future conduct.</P>
<P>Dermot being thus re-in&s;tated in his hereditary dominions, &s;oon began to conceive hopes of extend|ing
<PB N="52" REF="57">
the limits of his power, and making him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Ireland. With the&s;e views, he endeavour|ed to expedite Strongbow; who, being per&s;onally prohibited by the king, was not yet come over. Dermot tried to inflame his ambition by the glory of the conque&s;t; and his avarice by the advantages it would procure. He expatiated on the cowardice of the natives, and the certainty of his &s;ucce&s;s. Strongbow fir&s;t &s;ent over Raymond, one of his retinue, with ten knights and &s;eventy archers; and receiving permi&s;&s;ion &s;hortly after for him&s;elf, he landed with two hundred hor&s;e, and an hundred archers. All the&s;e Engli&s;h forces now joining together, became irre&s;i&s;tible; and though the whole number did not amount to a thou|&s;and, yet &s;uch was the barbarous &s;tate of the natives, that they were every where put to the rout. The city of Waterford quickly &s;urrendered; Dublin was taken by a&s;&s;ault; and Strongbow, &s;oon after marry|ing Eva according to treaty, became ma&s;ter of the kingdom of Lein&s;ter upon Dermot's decea&s;e.</P>
<P>The i&s;land being thus in a manner wholly &s;ubdued, for nothing was capable of oppo&s;ing the further pro|gre&s;s of the Engli&s;h arms, Henry became willing to &s;hare in per&s;on tho&s;e honours, which the adventurers had already &s;ecured. He, therefore, &s;hortly after landed in Ireland, at the head of five hundred knights and &s;ome &s;oldiers; not &s;o much to conquer a di&s;puted territory, as to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;ubjected kingdom. Thus after a trifling effort, in which very lit|tle money was expended, and little blood &s;hed, that beautiful i&s;land became an appendage to the En|gli&s;h crown, and as &s;uch it has ever &s;ince conti|nued, with un&s;haken fidelity.</P>
<P>The joy which this conque&s;t diffu&s;ed was very great; but troubles of a dome&s;tic nature &s;erved to render the remaining part of Henry's life a &s;cene of turbulence and di&s;quietude.</P>
<P>Among the few vices a&s;cribed to this monarch,
<PB N="53" REF="58">
unlimited gallantry was one. Queen Eleanor, whom he had married from motives of ambition, and who had been divorced from her former royal con&s;ort for her incontinence, was long become di&s;agreeable to Henry; and he &s;ought in others tho&s;e &s;atisfactions he could not find with her. Among the number of his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, Ro&s;amond Clifford, better known by the name of Fair Ro&s;amond, who&s;e per&s;onal charms, and who&s;e death make &s;o con&s;picuous a figure in the romances, and the ballads of the times, was the mo&s;t remarkable. She is &s;aid to have been the mo&s;t beau|tiful woman that was ever &s;een in England, and that Henry loved her with a long and faithful attachment.</P>
<P>In order to &s;ecure her from the re&s;entment of his queen, who, from having been formerly incontinent her&s;elf, now became jealous of his incontinence, he concealed her in a labyrinth in Wood&s;tock Park, where he pa&s;&s;ed in her company his hours of vacancy and plea&s;ure. How long this &s;ecret intercour&s;e con|tinued is not told us; but it was not &s;o clo&s;ely con|cealed but that it came to the queen's knowlege, who, as the accounts add, being guided by a clew of &s;ilk to her fair rival's retreat, obliged her, by holding a drawn dagger to her brea&s;t, to &s;wallow poi&s;on. What|ever may be the veracity of this &s;tory, certain it is, that this haughty woman, though formerly offen&s;ive by her own gallantries, was now no le&s;s &s;o by her jealou&s;y; and &s;he it was who fir&s;t &s;owed the &s;eeds of di&s;&s;en&s;ion between the king and his children.</P>
<P>Young Henry, the king's elde&s;t &s;on, was taught to believe him&s;elf injured; when, upon being crown|ed as partner in the kingdom, he was not admitted into a &s;hare of the admini&s;tration. His di&s;contents were &s;hared by his brothers Geo&s;&s;ry and Richard, whom the queen per&s;uaded to a&s;&s;ert their title to the territories a&s;&s;igned them. Queen Eleanor her&s;elf was meditating an e&s;cape to the court of France whi|ther her &s;ons had retired, and had put on man's apparel
<PB N="54" REF="59">
for that purpo&s;e when &s;he was &s;eized by the king's order and put into confinement. Thus Henry &s;aw all his long per&s;pective of future happine&s;s totally clouded; his &s;ons, &s;carce yet arrived at manhood, eager to &s;hare the &s;poils of their father's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; his queen warmly encouraging tho&s;e undutiful princes in their rebellion, and many potentates of Europe not a&s;hamed to lend them a&s;&s;i&s;tance to &s;upport their preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>It was not long before the young princes had &s;uf|ficient influence upon the continent to rai&s;e a pow|erful confederacy in their favour.</P>
<P>Henry, therefore, knowing the influence of &s;u|per&s;tition over the minds of the people, and perhaps, apprehen&s;ive that a part of his troubles aro&s;e from the di&s;plea&s;ure of heaven, re&s;olved to do penance at the &s;hrine of St. Thomas of Canterbury, for that was the name given to Becket upon his canonization. As &s;oon as he came within &s;ight of the church of Canter|bury, alighting from his hor&s;e, he walked barefoot towards the town, and pro&s;trated him&s;elf before the &s;hrine of the &s;aint. Next day he received ab&s;olution; and, departing for London, was acquainted with the agreeable news of a victory over the Scots, obtained on the very day of his ab&s;olution.</P>
<P>From that time Henry's affairs began to wear a bet|ter a&s;pect; the barons, who had revolted, or were pre|paring for a revolt, made in&s;tant &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, they delivered up their ca&s;tles to the victor, and Eng|land, in a few weeks, was re&s;tored to perfect tran|quility. Young Henry, who was ready to embark with a large army, to &s;econd the efforts of the En|gli&s;h in&s;urgents, finding all di&s;turbances quieted at home, abandoned all thoughts of the expedition.</P>
<P>This prince died &s;oon after, in the twenty-&s;ixth year of his age, of a fever, at Martel, not with|out the deepe&s;t remor&s;e for his undutiful conduct towards his father.</P>
<P>As this prince le&s;t no po&s;terity, Richard was be|come
<PB N="55" REF="60">
heir in his room; and he &s;oon di&s;covered the &s;ame ardent ambition that had mi&s;led his elder brother.</P>
<P>A cru&s;ade having been once more projected, Ri|chard, who had long wi&s;hed to have all the glory of &s;uch an expedition to him&s;elf, and who could not bear to have even his father a partner in his victories, en|tered into a confederacy with the king of France, who promi&s;ed to confirm him in tho&s;e wi&s;hes, at which he &s;o ardently a&s;pired. By this, Henry found him|&s;elf obliged to give up all hopes of taking the cro&s;s, and compelled to enter upon a war with France and his elde&s;t &s;on, who were unnaturally leagued again&s;t him.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, however, a treaty was concluded, in which he was obliged to &s;ubmit to many mortifying con|ce&s;&s;ions. But &s;till more &s;o, when upon demanding a li&s;t of the barons that it was &s;tipulated he &s;hould pardon, he found his &s;on John, his favourite child, among the number. He had long borne an infirm &s;tate of body with calm re&s;ignation; he had &s;een his children rebel without much emotion; but when he &s;aw that child, who&s;e intere&s;t always lay next his heart, among the number of tho&s;e who were in rebellion again&s;t him, he could no longer con|tain his indignation. He broke out into expre&s;|&s;ions of the utmo&s;t de&s;pair; cur&s;ed the day in which he had received his mi&s;erable being; and be&s;towed on his ungrateful children a malediction, which he never after could be prevailed upon to retract. The more his heart was di&s;po&s;ed to friend&s;hip and affec|tion, the more he re&s;ented this barba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous return; and now, not having one corner in his heart where he could look for comfort, or &s;ly for refuge from his conflicting pa&s;&s;ions, he lo&s;t all his former vi|vacity. A lingering &s;ever, cau&s;ed by a broken heart, &s;oon after terminated his life and his mi&s;eries. He died at the ca&s;tle of Chinon, near Saumur, in the fifty-eighth year of his age, and the thirty-fifth of
<PB N="56" REF="61">
his reign; in the cour&s;e of which he di&s;played all the abilities of a politician, all the &s;agacity of a legi&s;|lator, and all the magnanimity of an hero.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. RICHARD I. &s;urnamed COEUR DE LION.</HEAD>
<P>RICHARD, upon his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, was &s;till inflamed with the de&s;ire of going upon the cru&s;ade, and at length, the king having got to|gether a &s;ufficient &s;upply for his undertaking; hav|ing even &s;old his &s;uperiority over the kingdom of Scotland, which had been acquired in the la&s;t reign, for a moderate &s;um, he &s;et out for the Holy Land, whither he was impelled by repeated me&s;&s;ages from the king of France, who was ready to embark in the &s;ame enterprize.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t place of rendzvous for the two armies of England and France was the plain of Verelay, on the borders of Burgundy, where, when Richard and Philip arrived, they found their armies amount|ing to an hundred thou&s;and fighting men. Here the French prince and the Engli&s;h entered into the the mo&s;t &s;olemn engagements of mutual &s;upport; and having determined to conduct their armies to the Holy Land by &s;ea, they were obliged, however, by &s;tre&s;s of weather, to take &s;helter, in Me&s;&s;ina, the ca|pital of Sicily, where they were detained during the whole winter. Richard took up his quarters in the &s;uburbs, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of a &s;mall fort, which commanded the harbour. Philip quartered his troops in the town, and lived upon good terms with the Sicilian king.</P>
<P>Many were the mi&s;tru&s;ts, and the mutual recon|ciliations between the&s;e two monarchs, which were very probably inflamed by the Sicilian king's endea|vours.
<PB N="57" REF="62">
At length, however, having &s;ettled all con|trover&s;ies, they &s;et &s;ail for the Holy Land, where the French arrived long before the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>Upon the arrival of the Engli&s;h army in Pale&s;|tine, however, fortune was &s;een to declare more openly in favour of the common cau&s;e. The French and Engli&s;h princes &s;eemed to forget their &s;eeret jealou&s;ies, and to act in concert. But &s;hortly af|ter, Philip, from the bad &s;tate of his health, re|turned to France, leaving Richard ten thou&s;and of his troops under the command of the duke of Bur|gundy. Richard, being now left &s;ole conductor of the war, went on from victory to victory. The Chri&s;tian adventurers, under his command, deter|mined to be&s;iege the renowned city of A&s;ealon, in order to prepare the way for attacking Jeru|&s;alem with greater advantage. Saladin, the mo&s;t heroic of all the Saracen monarchs, was re&s;olved to di&s;pute their march, and placed him&s;elf up on the road with an army of three hundred thou&s;and men. This was a day equal to Richard's wi&s;hes, this an enemy worthy his highe&s;t ambition. The Engli&s;h cru&s;aders were victorious. Richard, when the wings of his army were defeated, led on the main body in per&s;on, and re&s;tored the battle. The Saracens fled in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion; and no le&s;s than for|ty thou&s;and of their number peri&s;hed in the field of battle. A&s;calon &s;oon &s;urrendered after this vic|tory; other cities of le&s;s note followed the exam|ple, and Richard was at la&s;t able to advance with|in &s;ight of Jeru&s;alem, the object of his long and ardent expectations. But, ju&s;t at this glorious junc|ture his ambition was to &s;uffer a total overthrow; upon reviewing his forces, and con&s;idering his abi|lities to pro&s;ecute the &s;iege, he found that his army was &s;o wa&s;ted with famine, fatigue, and even with victory, that they were neither able nor willing to &s;econd the views of their commander. It appeared,
<PB N="58" REF="63">
therefore, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to come to an accom|modation with Saladin; and a truce for three years was accordingly concluded; in which it was agreed, that the &s;ea-port towns of Pale&s;tine &s;hould remain in the hands of the Chri&s;tians; and that all of that religion &s;hould be permitted to make their pilgrimage to Jeru&s;alem in perfect &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>Richard, having thus concluded his expedition with more glory than advantage, began to think of returning home: but being obliged to take the road through Germany, in the habit of a pilgrim, he was arre&s;ted by Leopold, duke of Au&s;tria, who com|manded him to be impri&s;oned and loaded with &s;hac|kles, to the di&s;grace of honour and humanity. The emperor &s;oon after required the pri&s;oner to be de|livered up to him, and &s;tipulated a large &s;um of money to the duke as a reward for this &s;ervice. Thus the king of England, who had long filled the world with his fame, was ba&s;ely thrown into a dun|geon, and loaded with irons, by tho&s;e who expect|ed to reap a &s;ordid advantage from his misfortunes. It was a long time before his &s;ubjects in England knew what was become of their beloved monarch. So little intercour&s;e was there between different na|tions at that time, that this di&s;covery is &s;aid by &s;ome to have been made by a poor French min&s;trel, who playing upon his harp near the fortre&s;s in which Richard was confined, a tune which he knew that unhappy monarch was fond of, he was an&s;wered by the king from within, who with his harp played the &s;ame tune; and thus di&s;covered the place of his confinement.</P>
<P>However, the Engli&s;h, at length, prevailed upon this barbarous monarch, who now &s;aw that he could no longer detain his pri&s;oner, to li&s;ten to terms of accommodation. A ran&s;om was agreed upon, which amounted to an hundred and fifty thou&s;and marks, or about three hundred thou&s;and pounds of our mo|ney;
<PB N="59" REF="64">
upon the payment of which Richard was once more re&s;tored to his expecting &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Nothing could exceed the joy of the Engli&s;h, upon &s;eeing their monarch return, after all his atchieve|ments and &s;ufferings. He made his entry into Lon|don in triumph; and &s;uch was the profu&s;ion of wealth &s;hewn by the citizens, that the German lords, who attended him, were heard to &s;ay, that if the emperor had known of their affluence, he would not &s;o ea&s;ily have parted with their king. He &s;oon after ordered him&s;elf to be crowned a-new at Win|che&s;ter. He convoked a general council at Not|tingham, at which he confi&s;cated all his brother John's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, who had ba&s;ely endeavoured to prolong his captivity, and gone over to the king of France with that intent. However, he pardoned him &s;oon after, with this generous remark, I wi&s;h I could as ea&s;ily forget my brother's offence as he will my pardon.</P>
<P>Richard's death was occa&s;ioned by a &s;ingular ac|cident. A va&s;&s;al of the crown had taken po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of a trea&s;ure, which was found by one of his pea&s;ants in digging a field in France; and to &s;ecure the remainder, he &s;ent a part of it to the king. Ri|chard, as &s;uperior lord, &s;en&s;ible that he had a right to the whole, in&s;i&s;ted on its being &s;ent him; and, upon refu&s;al, attacked the ca&s;tle of Chalus, where he under&s;tood this trea&s;ure had been depo&s;ited. On the fourth day of the &s;iege, as he was riding round the place to ob&s;erve where the a&s;&s;ault might be given with the faire&s;t probability of &s;ucce&s;s, he was aim|ed at by one Bertram de Jourdon, an archer, from the ca&s;tle, and pierced in the &s;houlder with an ar|row. The wound was not in it&s;elf dangerous; but an un&s;kilful &s;urgeon endeavouring to di&s;engage the arrow from the fle&s;h, &s;o rankled the wound that it mortified, and brought on fatal &s;ymptoms. Richard, when he found his end approaching, made a will,
<PB N="60" REF="65">
in which he bequeathed the kingdom, with all his trea&s;ure, to his brother John, except a fourth part, which he di&s;tributed among his &s;ervants. He ordered al&s;o, that the archer who had &s;hot him, &s;hould be brought into his pre&s;ence, and demanded what injury he had done him that he &s;hould take away his life? The pri&s;oner an&s;wered with delibe|rate intrepidity; "You killed, with your own hands, my father, and my two brothers, and you in|tended to have hanged me. I am now in your power, and my torments may give you revenge; but I will endure them with plea&s;ure, &s;ince it is my con&s;olation, that I have rid the world of a ty|rant." Richard, &s;truck with this an&s;wer, ordered the &s;oldier to be pre&s;ented with one hundred &s;hil|lings, and &s;et at liberty; but Marcade, the general, who commanded under him, like a true ruf|fian, ordered him to be &s;tead alive, and then hanged. Richard died in the tenth year of his reign, and the forty-&s;econd of his age, leaving only one natu|ral &s;on, called Philip, behind him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. JOHN.</HEAD>
<P>JOHN, who was readily put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h throne, lo&s;t no time to &s;econd his in|tere&s;t on the continent; and his fir&s;t care was to re|cover the revolted provinces from young Arthur, his nephew. But from the pride and cruelty of his temper, he &s;oon became hateful to his &s;ubjects; and his putting his nephew, Arthur, who had a right to the crown, to death, with his own hands, in pri&s;on, &s;erved to render him completely hate|ful.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="66">Hitherto John was rather hateful to his &s;ubjects than contemptible; they rather dreaded than de&s;pi&s;ed him. But he &s;oon &s;hewed that he might be offended. if not without re&s;entment at lea&s;t with impunity. It was the fate of this vicious prince to make tho&s;e the enemies of him&s;elf whom he wanted abilities to make the enemies of each other. The clergy had for &s;ome time acted as a community independent on the crown, and had their elections of each other generally con|firmed by the pope, to whom alone they owned &s;ub|jection. However, the election of archbi&s;hops had for &s;ome time been a continual &s;ubject of di&s;pute be|tween the &s;uffragan bi&s;hops and the Augu&s;tine monks, and both had precedents to confirm their preten&s;ions. John &s;ided with the bi&s;hops, and &s;ent two knights of his train, who were fit in&s;truments for &s;uch a prince, to expel the monks from their convent, and to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their revenues. The pope was not di&s;|plea&s;ed at the&s;e divi&s;ions, and in&s;tead of electing either of the per&s;ons appointed by the contending parties, he appointed Stephen Langton, as archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury. John, however, refu&s;ing to admit the man of the pope's chu&s;ing, the kingdom was put under an|interdict. This in&s;trument of terror in the hands of the &s;ee of Rome, was calculated to &s;trike the &s;en&s;es in the highe&s;t degree, and to operate upon the &s;uper|&s;titious minds of the people. By it a &s;top was imme|diately put to divine &s;ervice, and to the admini&s;tration of all the &s;acraments, but bapti&s;m. The church doors were &s;hut, the &s;tatues of the &s;aints were laid on the ground. The dead were refu&s;ed Chri&s;tian burial, and were thrown into ditches and on the highways, without the u&s;ual rites, or any funeral &s;olemnity.</P>
<P>No &s;ituation could be more deplorable than that of John upon this occa&s;ion. Furious at his indig|nities, jealous of his &s;ubjects, and apprehending an enemy in every face; it is &s;aid, that fearing a con|&s;piracy again&s;t his life, he &s;hut him&s;elf up a whole
<PB N="62" REF="67">
night in the ca&s;tle of Nottingham, and &s;uffered none to approach his per&s;on. But what was his con&s;ter|nation when he found that the pope had actually given away his kingdom to the monarch of France, and that the prince of that country was actually prepar|ing with an army to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his crown!</P>
<P>John, who, un&s;ettled and apprehen&s;ive, &s;carcely knew where to turn, was &s;till able to make an ex|piring effort to receive the enemy. All hated as he was, the natural enmity between the French and the Engli&s;h, the name of king, which he &s;till retained, and &s;ome remaining power, put him at the head of &s;ixty thou&s;and men, a &s;ufficient number indeed, but not to be relied on, and with the&s;e he advanced to Dover. Europe now regarded the important prepa|rations on both &s;ides with impatience; and the de|ci&s;ive blow was &s;oon expected, in which the church was to triumph, or to be overthrown. But neither Philip nor John had ability equal to the pontiff by whom they were actuated; he appeared on this oc|ca&s;ion too refined a politician for either. He only intended to make u&s;e of Philip's power to intimidate his refractory &s;on, not to de&s;troy him. He intimated, therefore, to John by his legate, that there was but one way to &s;ecure him&s;elf from impending danger; which was, to put him&s;elf under the pope's protection, who was a merciful father, and &s;till willing to receive a repentant &s;inner to his bo&s;om. John was too much intimidated, by the manife&s;t danger of his &s;ituation, not to embrace every means offered for his &s;afety. He a&s;&s;ented to the truthof the legate's remon&s;trances, and took an oath to perform whatever &s;tipulations the pope &s;hould impo&s;e. Having thus &s;worn to the performance of an unknown command, the artful Italian &s;o well managed the barons, and &s;o effectually intimidated the king, that he per&s;uaded him to take the mo&s;t extraordinary oath in all the records of hi&s;|tory, before all the people, kneeling upon his knees,

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I John, by the grace of God, king of England, and lord of Ireland, in order to expiate my &s;ins, from my own free will, and the advice of my ba|rons, give to the church of Rome, to pope Inno|cent, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, the kingdom of England, and all other prerogatives of my crown.

Having thus done homage to the legate, and agreed to rein&s;tate Langton in the primacy, he received the crown, which he had been &s;uppo&s;ed to have forfeited, while the legate trampled under his feet the tribute which John had con&s;ented to pay. Thus by this mo&s;t &s;candalous conce&s;&s;ion John for once more averted the threatened blow.</P>
<P>In this manner, by repeated acts of cruelty, by expeditions without effect, and humiliations with|out re&s;erve, John was become the dete&s;tation of all mankind.</P>
<P>The barons had been long forming a confederacy again&s;t him; but their union was broken, or their aims di&s;appointed, by various and unfore&s;een acci|dents. At length, however, they a&s;&s;embled a large body of men at Stamford, and from thence, elated with their power, they marched to Brackley, about fifteen miles from Oxford, the place where the court then re&s;ided. John, hearing of their approach, &s;ent the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, the earl of Pembroke, and others of his council, to know the particulars of their reque&s;t, and what tho&s;e liberties were which they &s;o earne&s;tly importuned him to grant. The barons delivered a &s;chedule, containing the chief ar|ticles
<PB N="64" REF="70">
of their demands, and of which the former charters of Henry and Edward formed the groundwork. No &s;ooner were the&s;e &s;hewn to the king, than he bur&s;t into a furious pa&s;&s;ion, and a&s;ked why the barons did not al&s;o demand his kingdom, &s;wearing that he would never comply with &s;uch exorbitant demands? But the confederacy was now too &s;trong to fear much from the con&s;equences of his re&s;entment? They cho&s;e Robert Fitzwalter for their general, whom they dignified with the titles of
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mare&s;chal of the army of God, and of the holy church,"</Q>
and proceeded without further ceremony to make war upon the king. They be&s;ieged Northampton, they took Bed|ford, they were joyfully received in London. They wrote circular letters to all the nobility and gentle|men who had not yet declared in their &s;avour, and menaced their e&s;tates with deva&s;tation, in ca&s;e of re|fu&s;al or delay.</P>
<P>John, &s;truck with terror, fir&s;t offered to refer all differences to the pope alone, or to eight barons, four to be cho&s;en by him&s;elf, and four by the con|federates. This the barons &s;cornfully rejected. He then a&s;&s;ured them, that he would &s;ubmit at di&s;cretion; and that it was his &s;upreme plea&s;ure to grant all their demands: a conference was accordingly appointed, and all things adju&s;ted for this mo&s;t important treaty.</P>
<P>The ground where the king's commi&s;&s;ioners met the barons was between Staines and Wind&s;or, at a place called Runimede, &s;till held in reverence by po&s;terity, as the &s;pot where the &s;tandard of freedom was fir&s;t erected in England. There the barons ap|peared, with a va&s;t number of knights and warriors, on the fifteenth day of June, while tho&s;e on the king's part, came a day or two after. Both &s;ides en|camped apart, like open enemies. The debate be|tween power and precedent are generally but of &s;hort continuance. The barons, determined on carrying their aims, would admit of few abatements; and
<PB N="65" REF="71">
the king's agents being for the mo&s;t part in their in|tere&s;ts, few debates en&s;ued. After &s;ome days, the king, with a facility that was &s;omewhat &s;u&s;picious, &s;igned and &s;ealed the charter required of him; a charter which continues in force to this day, and is the famous bulwark of Engli&s;h liberty, which now goes by the name of MAGNA CHARTA. This fa|mous deed, either granted or &s;ecured freedom to tho&s;e orders of the kingdom that were already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of freedom, namely, to the clergy, the barons, and the gentlemen; as for the inferior, and the greate&s;t part of the people, they were as yet held as &s;laves, and it was long before they could come to a participation of legal protection.</P>
<P>John however could not well brook tho&s;e conce&s;|&s;ions that were extorted from his fears, he therefore took the fir&s;t opportunity of denying to be in the lea&s;t governed by them. This produced a &s;econd civil war, in which the barons were obliged to have re|cour&s;e to the king of France for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Thus England &s;aw nothing but a pro&s;pect of being every way undone. If John &s;ucceeded, a tyrannical and implacable monarch was to be their tormentor; if the French king &s;hould prevail, the country was ever after to &s;ubmit to a more powerful monarchy, and was to become a province of France. What neither human prudence could fore&s;ee, nor policy &s;ugge&s;t, was brought about by an happy and unexpected event.</P>
<P>John had a&s;&s;embled a con&s;iderable army, with a view to make one great effort for the crown; and at the head of a large body of troops, re&s;olved to pene|trate into the heart of the kingdom. With the&s;e re|&s;olutions he departed from Lyn, which, for its fidelity, he had di&s;tingui&s;hed with many marks of favour, and directed his route towards Lincoln&s;hire. His road lay along the &s;hore, which was overflowed at high water; but not being appri&s;ed of this, or being ig|norant
<PB N="66" REF="72">
of the tide of the place, he lo&s;t all his carriages, trea&s;ure, and baggage, by its influx. He him&s;elf e&s;|caped with the greate&s;t difficulty, and arrived at the abbey of Swin&s;tead, where his grief for the lo&s;s he had &s;u&s;tained, and the di&s;tracted &s;tate of his affairs, threw him into a fever, which &s;oon appeared to be fatal. Next day, being unable to ride on hor&s;eback, he was carried in a litter to the ca&s;tle of Seaford, and from thence removed to Newark, where, after having made his will, he died in the fifty-fir&s;t year of his age, and the eighteenth of his dete&s;ted reign.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. HENRY III.</HEAD>
<P>A CLAIM was, upon the death of John, made in favour of young Henry, the &s;on of the late king, who was now but nine years of age. The earl of Pembroke, a nobleman of great worth and valour, who had faithfully adhered to John in all the fluctuations of his fortune, determined to &s;upport his declining intere&s;ts, and had him &s;olemnly crowned by the bi&s;hops of Winche&s;ter and Bath, at Glou|ce&s;ter.</P>
<P>The young king was of a character the very oppo|&s;ite of his father; as he grew up to man's e&s;tate, he was found to be gentle, merciful, and humane; he appeared ea&s;y and good natured to his dependents, but no way formidable to his enemies. Without ac|tivity or vigour, he was unfit to conduct in war; without di&s;tru&s;t or &s;u&s;picion, he was impo&s;ed upon in times of peace.</P>
<P>As weak princes are never without governing fa|vourites, he fir&s;t placed his affections on Hubert de Burgh, and he becoming obnoxious to the people, the place was &s;oon &s;upplied by Peter de Roches,
<PB N="67" REF="73">
bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, a Poictevin by birth, a man remarkable for his arbitrary conduct, for his courage, and his abilities. Henry, in pur&s;uance of this pre|late's advice, invited over a great number of Poicte|vins, and other foreigners, who having neither prin|ciples nor fortunes at home, were willing to adopt whatever &s;chemes their employer &s;hould propo&s;e. Every office and command was be&s;towed on the&s;e un|principled &s;trangers, who&s;e avarice and rapacity were exceeded only by their pride and in&s;olence. So un|ju&s;t a partiality to &s;trangers very naturally excited the jealou&s;y of the barons; and they even ventured to a&s;&s;ure the king, that if he did not di&s;mi&s;s all fo|reigners from court, they would drive both him and them out of the kingdom; but their anger was &s;carce kept within bounds when they &s;aw a new &s;warm of the&s;e intruders come over from Ga&s;cony, with I&s;a|bella, the king's mother, who had been &s;ome time before married to the count de la Marche. To the&s;e ju&s;t cau&s;es of complaint were added the king's un|&s;ucce&s;sful expeditions to the continent, his total want of oeconomy, and his oppre&s;&s;ive exactions, which were but the re&s;ult of the former. The kingdom therefore waited with gloomy re&s;olution, re&s;olving to take vengeance, when the general di&s;content was ar|rived at maturity.</P>
<P>This imprudent preference, joined to a thou&s;and other illegal eva&s;ions of ju&s;tice, at la&s;t impelled Si|mon Mont&s;ort, earl of Leice&s;ter, to attempt an in|novation in the government, and to wre&s;t the &s;ceptre from the feeble hand that held it. This nobleman was the &s;on of the famous general who commanded again&s;t the Albigen&s;es, a &s;ect of enthu&s;ia&s;ts that had been de&s;troyed &s;ome time before in the kingdom of Savoy. He was married to the king's &s;i&s;ter; and, by his power and addre&s;s, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;trong intere&s;t in the nation, having gained equally the af|fections of the great and the little.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="74">The fir&s;t place where the formidable confederacy which he formed fir&s;t di&s;covered it&s;elf, was in the par|liament-hou&s;e, where the barons appeared in com|plete armour. The king, upon his entry, a&s;ked them what was their intention; to which they &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively replied, to make him their &s;overeign, by confirming his power, and to have their grievances redre&s;&s;ed. Henry, who was ready enough to promi&s;e whatever was demanded, in&s;tantly a&s;&s;ured them of his intenti|ons to give all po&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction; and for that pur|po&s;e, &s;ummoned a parliament at Oxford, to dige&s;t a new plan of government, and to elect proper per|&s;ons, who were to be entru&s;ted with the chief autho|rity. This parliament, afterwards called the <HI>mad parliament,</HI> went expeditiou&s;ly to work upon the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of reformation. Twenty-four barons were ap|pointed, with &s;upreme authority, to reform the a|bu&s;es of the &s;tate, and Leice&s;ter was placed at their head. The whole &s;tate in their hands underwent a complete alteration; all its former officers were di&s;|placed, and creatures of the twenty-four barons were put in their room. They not only abridged the au|thority of the king, but the efficacy of parliament, giving up to twelve per&s;ons all parliamentary power between each &s;e&s;&s;ion. Thus the&s;e in&s;olent nobles, after having trampled upon the crown, threw pro&s;|trate all the rights of the people, and a vile oli|garchy was on the point of being e&s;tabli&s;hed for ever.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t oppo&s;ition that was made to the&s;e u&s;ur|pations, was from a power, which but lately began to take place in the con&s;titution. The knights of the &s;hire, who, for &s;ome time, had begun to be regu|larly a&s;&s;embled in a &s;eparate hou&s;e, now fir&s;t per|ceived tho&s;e grievances, and complained again&s;t them. They repre&s;ented, that their own intere&s;ts and power &s;eemed the only aim of all their decrees; and they even called upon the king's elde&s;t &s;on, prince Ed|ward,
<PB N="69" REF="75">
to interpo&s;e his authority, and &s;ave the &s;inking nation.</P>
<P>Prince Edward was at this time about twenty-two years of age. The hopes which were conceived of his abilities and his integrity rendered him an impor|tant per&s;onage in the tran&s;actions of the times, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure atoned for his father's imbecility. He had at a very early age, given the &s;tronge&s;t proofs of courage, of wi&s;dom, and of con&s;tancy. At fir&s;t, indeed, when applied to, appearing &s;en&s;ible of what his father had &s;uffered by levity and breach of pro|mi&s;e, he refu&s;ed &s;ome time to li&s;ten to the people's earne&s;t application; but being at la&s;t per&s;uaded to concur, a parliament was called, in which the king re&s;umed his former authority.</P>
<P>This being con&s;idered as a breach of the late con|vention, a civil war en&s;ued, in which in a pitched battle, the earl of Leice&s;ter became victorious, and the king was taken pri&s;oner, but &s;oon after exchanged for prince Edward, who was to remain as an ho&s;tage to en&s;ure the punctual ob&s;ervance of the former agreement.</P>
<P>With all the&s;e advantages however, Leice&s;ter was not &s;o entirely &s;ecure, but that he &s;till feared the com|binations of the foreign &s;tates again&s;t him, as well as the internal machinations of the royal party. In or|der therefore to &s;ecure his ill-acquired power, he was obliged to have recour&s;e to an aid till now entirely unknown in England, namely, that of the body of the people. He called a parliament, where, be&s;ides the barons of his own party, and &s;everal eccle&s;ia&s;tics, who were not immediate tenants of the crown, he or|dered returns to be made of two knights from every &s;hire; and al&s;o deputies from the boroughs, which had been hitherto con&s;idered as too incon&s;iderable to have a voice in legi&s;lation. This is the fir&s;t confirmed outline of an Engli&s;h hou&s;e of commons. The people
<PB N="70" REF="76">
had been gaining &s;ome con&s;ideration &s;ince the gradual diminution of the force of the feudal &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>This parliament, however, was found not &s;o very complying as he expected. Many of the barons, who had hitherto &s;tedfa&s;tly adhered to his party, appeared di&s;gu&s;ted at his immoderate ambition; and many of the people, who found that a change of ma&s;ters was not a change for happine&s;s, began to wi&s;h for the re|e&s;tabli&s;hment of the royal family. In this exigence, Leice&s;ter finding him&s;elf unable to oppo&s;e the con|curring wi&s;hes of the nation, was re&s;olved to make a merit of what he could not prevent; and he accord|ingly relea&s;ed prince Edward from confinement, and had him introduced at We&s;tmin&s;ter hall, where his freedom was confirmed by the unanimous voice of the barons. But though Leice&s;ter had all the popu|larity of re&s;toring the prince, yet he was politic enough to keep him &s;till guarded by his emi&s;&s;aries, who watched all his motions, and fru&s;trated all his aims.</P>
<P>Wherefore the prince upon bearing that the duke of Glouce&s;ter was up in arms in his cau&s;e, he took an opportunity to e&s;cape from his guards, and put him&s;elf at the head of his party. A battle &s;oon af|ter en&s;ued; but the earl's army having been ex|hau&s;ted by famine on the mountains of Wales, were but ill able to &s;u&s;tain the impetuo&s;ity of young Ed|ward's attack, who bore down upon them with incre|dible fury. During this terrible day, Leice&s;ter be|haved with a&s;toni&s;hing intrepidity; and kept up the &s;pirit of the action from two o'clock in the afternoon, till nine at night. At la&s;t, his hor&s;e being killed un|der him, he was compelled to fight on foot; and tho' he demanded quarter, the adver&s;e party refu&s;ed it, with a barbarity common enough in the times we are de&s;cribing. The old king, who was placed in the front of the battle, was &s;oon wounded in the &s;houl|der; and not being known by his friends, he was on
<PB N="71" REF="77">
the point of being killed by a &s;oldier; but crying out, I am Henry of Winche&s;ter the king, he was &s;aved by a knight of the royal army. Prince Edward hearing the voice of his father, in&s;tantly ran to the &s;pot where he lay, and had him conducted to a place of &s;afety. The body of Leice&s;ter being found among the dead, was barbarou&s;ly mangled by one Roger Mortimer; and then, with an accumulation of in|humanity, &s;ent to the wretched widow, as a te&s;ti|mony of the royal party's &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>This victory proved deci&s;ive; and the prince hav|ing thus re&s;tored peace to the kingdom, found his af|fairs &s;o firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, that he re&s;olved upon taking the cro&s;s, which was at that time the highe&s;t object of human ambition.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of this re&s;olution, Edward &s;ailed from England with a large army, and arrived at the camp of Lewis, the king of France, which lay before Tu|nis; and where he had the misfortune to hear of that good monarch's death before his arrival. The prince, however, no way di&s;couraged by this event, conti|nued his voyage, and arrived at the Holy Land in &s;afety.</P>
<P>He was &s;carce departed upon this pious expedi|tion, when the health of the old king began to decline; and he found not only his own con&s;titution, but al&s;o that of the &s;tate, in &s;uch a dangerous &s;ituation, that he wrote letters to his &s;on, pre&s;&s;ing him to return with all di&s;patch. At la&s;t being overcome by the cares of government, and the infirmities of age, he ordered him&s;elf to be removed, by ea&s;y journies, from St. Edmund's to We&s;tmin&s;ter, and that &s;ame night expired, in the &s;ixty-fourth year of his age, and the fifty-&s;ixth of his reign, the longe&s;t to be met with in the annals of England.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. EDWARD I.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE the unfortunate Henry was thus vainly &s;truggling with the ungovernable &s;pi|rit of his &s;ubjects, his &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or, Edward, was employed in the Holy Wars, where he revived the glory of the Engli&s;h name, and made the ene|mies of Chri&s;tianity tremble. He was &s;tabbed how|ever, by one of tho&s;e Mahometan enthu&s;ia&s;ts, called A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, as he was one day &s;itting in his tent, and was cured not without great difficulty. Some &s;ay that he owed his &s;afety to the piety of Eleanora his wife, who &s;ucked the poi&s;on from the wound to &s;ave his life, at the hazard of her own.</P>
<P>Though the death of the late king happened while the &s;ucce&s;&s;or was &s;o far from home, yet mea&s;ures had been &s;o well taken, that the crown was transferred with the greate&s;t tranquility.</P>
<P>As Edward was now come to an undi&s;puted throne, the oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts were proportionably feeble. The barons were exhau&s;ted by long mutual di&s;&s;en|&s;ions; the clergy were divided in their intere&s;ts, and agreed only in one point, to hate the pope, who had for &s;ome time drained them, with impunity: the peo|ple, by &s;ome in&s;urrections again&s;t the convents, appear to hate the clergy with equal animo&s;ity. The&s;e di&s;agreeing orders only concurred in one point, that of e&s;teeming and reverencing the king. He therefore thought this the mo&s;t favourable conjunc|ture of uniting England with Wales. The Wel&s;h had for many ages enjoyed their own laws, language, cu&s;toms, and opinions. They were the remains of the ancient Britons, who had e&s;caped the Roman and Saxon inva&s;ions, and &s;till pre&s;erved their freedom and
<PB N="73" REF="79">
their country, uncontaminated by the admi&s;&s;ion of foreign conquerors. But as they were, from their number, incapable of with&s;tanding their more power|ful neighbours on the plain, their chief defence lay in their inacce&s;&s;ible mountains, tho&s;e natural bulwarks of the country. Whenever England was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by factions at home, or its forces called off to wars abroad, the Wel&s;h made it a con&s;tant practice to pour in their irregular troops, and lay the open country wa&s;te where-ever they came. Nothing could be more pernicious to a country than &s;everal neighbour|ing independent principalities, under different com|manders, and pur&s;uing different intere&s;ts; the mu|tual jealou&s;ies of &s;uch were &s;ure to harra&s;s the people; and wherever victory was purcha&s;ed, it was always at the expence of the general welfare. Sen&s;ible of this, Edward had long wi&s;hed to reduce that incur|&s;ive people, and had ordered Lewellyn to do homage for his territories; which &s;ummons the Wel&s;h prince refu&s;ed to obey, unle&s;s the king's own &s;on &s;hould be delivered as an ho&s;tage for his &s;afe return. The king was not di&s;plea&s;ed at this refu&s;al, as it &s;erved to give him a pretext for his intended inva&s;ion. He there|fore levied an army again&s;t Lewellyn, and marched into his country with certain a&s;&s;urance of &s;ucce&s;s. Upon the approach of Edward, the Wel&s;h prince took refuge among the inacce&s;&s;ible mountains of Snowdon, and there re&s;olved to maintain his ground, without tru&s;ting to the chance of a battle. The&s;e were the &s;teep retreats, that had for many ages be|fore defended his ance&s;tors again&s;t all the attempts of the Norman and Saxon conquerors. But Edward, equally vigorous and cautious, having explored every part of his way, pierced into the very center of Le|wellyn's territories, and approached the Wel&s;h army in its la&s;t retreats. Here after extorting &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion from the Wel&s;h prince the king retired. But an idle prophecy, in which it was foretold by Merlin,
<PB N="74" REF="80">
that Lewellyn was to be the re&s;torer of Brutus's em|pire in Britain, was an inducement &s;ufficiently &s;trong to per&s;uade this prince to revolt once more and hazard a deci&s;ive battle again&s;t the Engli&s;h. With this view he marched into Radnor&s;hire; and pa&s;&s;ing the river Wey, his troops were &s;urpri&s;ed and defeated by Ed|ward Mortimer, while he him&s;elf was ab&s;ent from his army, upon a conference with &s;ome of the barons of that country. Upon his return, &s;eeing the dreadful &s;ituation of his affairs, he ran de&s;perately into the mid&s;t of the enemy, and quickly found that death he &s;o ardently &s;ought for. David, the brother of this unfortunate prince, &s;oon after fell in the &s;ame cau&s;e; and with him expired the government, and the di&s;tinction of the Wel&s;h nation. It was &s;oon af|ter united to the kingdom of England, made a prin|cipality, and given to the elde&s;t &s;on of the crown. Foreign conque&s;ts might add to the glory, but this added to the felicity of the kingdom. The Wel&s;h were now blended with the conquerors; and in the revolution of a few ages, all national animo&s;ity was entirely forgotten.</P>
<P>Soon after the death of Margaret, queen of Scot|land, gave him hopes of adding al&s;o Scotland to his dominion. The death of this prince&s;s produced a mo&s;t ardent di&s;pute about the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the Scotti&s;h throne, being claimed by no le&s;s than twelve competitors. The claims however of all the other can|didates were reduced to three; who were the de|&s;cendants of the earl of Huntington by three daugh|ters; John Ha&s;tings, who claimed in right of his mother, as one of the co-heire&s;&s;es of the crown; John Baliol, who alledged his right, as being de|&s;cended from the elde&s;t daughter, who was his grand|mother; and Robert Bruce, who was the actual &s;on of the &s;econd daughter. This di&s;pute being referred to Edwards deci&s;ion, with a &s;trong degree of a&s;&s;urance, he claimed the crown for him&s;elf, and appointed Baliol his deputy.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="81">Baliol being thus placed upon the Scotti&s;h throne, le&s;s as a king than as a va&s;&s;al, Edward's fir&s;t &s;tep was &s;ufficient to convince that people of his intentions to &s;tretch the prerogative to the utmo&s;t. Upon the mo&s;t frivolous pretences, he &s;ent &s;ix different &s;ummon&s;es for Baliol to appear in London at different times, in one year; &s;o that the poor Scotti&s;h king &s;oon per|ceived that he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the name only, but not the authority of a &s;overeign. Willing, therefore, to &s;hake off the yoke of &s;o trouble&s;ome a ma&s;ter, Ba|liol revolted, and procured the pope's ab&s;olution from his former oaths of homage.</P>
<P>But no power the Scotch could bring into the field was able to with&s;tand the victorious army of Edward. He overthrew their forces in many engagements, and thus becoming undi&s;puted ma&s;ter of the kingdom, he took every precaution to &s;ecure his title, and to abo|li&s;h tho&s;e di&s;tinctions, which might be apt to keep the nation in its former independence. Baliol was car|ried a pri&s;oner to London, and he carefully de&s;troyed all records and monuments of antiquity, that in&s;pired the Scotch with a &s;pirit of national pride.</P>
<P>The&s;e expeditions, however, terminated rather in glory than advantage: the expences which were re|qui&s;ite for carrying on the war, were not only bur|then&s;ome to the king, but even, in the event, threat|ened to &s;hake him on his throne. In order at fir&s;t to &s;et the great machine in movement, he rai&s;ed con&s;ider|able &s;upplies by means of his parliament; and that augu&s;t body was then fir&s;t modelled by him into the form in which it continues to this day. As a great part of the property of the kingdom was, by the in|troduction of commerce, and the improvement of agriculture, transferred from the barons to the lower cla&s;&s;es of the people, &s;o their con&s;ent was thought nece&s;&s;ary for the rai&s;ing any con&s;iderable &s;upplies. For this rea&s;on, he i&s;&s;ued writs to the &s;heriffs, en|joining them to &s;end to parliament along with two
<PB N="76" REF="82">
knights of the &s;hire, (as in the former reign) two de|puties from each borough within their county; and the&s;e provided with &s;ufficient powers from their con|&s;tituents, to grant &s;uch demands as they &s;hould think rea&s;onable for the &s;afety of the &s;tate. One of the fir&s;t efforts, therefore, was to oblige the king's coun|cil to &s;ign the Magna Charta, and to add a clau&s;e, to &s;ecure the nation for ever again&s;t all impo&s;itions and taxes, without the con&s;ent of parliament. This the king's council (for Edward was at that time in Flan|ders) readily agreed to &s;ign; and the king him&s;elf, when it was &s;ent over to him, after &s;ome he&s;itation, thought proper to do the &s;ame. The&s;e conce&s;&s;ions he again confirmed upon his return; and though it is probable he was aver&s;e to granting them, yet he was at la&s;t brought to give a plenary con&s;ent to all the articles that were demanded of him. Thus, after the conte&s;t of an age, the Magna Charta was finally e&s;tab|li&s;hed: nor was it the lea&s;t circum&s;tance in its favour, that its confirmation was procured from one of the greate&s;t and bolde&s;t princes that ever &s;wayed the Eng|li&s;h &s;ceptre.</P>
<P>In the mean time, William Wallace, &s;o celebrated in Scotti&s;h &s;tory, attempted to re&s;cue Scotland from the Engli&s;h yoke He was younger &s;on of a gentle|man, who lived in the we&s;tern part of the kingdom. He was a man of a gigantic &s;tature, incredible &s;trength, and amazing intrepidity; eagerly de&s;irous of independence, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the mo&s;t di&s;in|tere&s;ted &s;pirit of patrioti&s;m. To this man had re|&s;orted all tho&s;e who were obnoxious to the Engli&s;h go|vernment; the proud, the bold, the criminal, and the ambitious. The&s;e, bred among dangers and hard&s;hips them&s;elves, could not forbear admiring in their leader a degree of patience, under fatigue and famine, which they &s;uppo&s;ed beyond the power of human nature to endure; he &s;oon, therefore, became the principal object of their affection and their e&s;teem.
<PB N="77" REF="83">
His fir&s;t exploits were confined to petty ravages, and occa&s;ional attacks upon the Engli&s;h; but he &s;oon over|threw the Engli&s;h armies, and &s;lew their generals.</P>
<P>Edward, who had been over in Flanders, while the&s;e misfortunes happened in England, ha&s;tened back with impatience to re&s;tore his authority, and &s;ecure his former conque&s;ts. He quickly levied the whole force of his dominions; and at the head of an hun|dred thou&s;and men, directed his march to the North, fully re&s;olved to take vengeance upon the Scots for their late defection.</P>
<P>A battle was fought at Falkirk, in which Edward gained a complete victory, leaving twelve thou&s;and of the Scotch, or, as &s;ome will have it, fifty thou&s;and, dead upon the field, while the Engli&s;h had not an hundred &s;lain.</P>
<P>A blow &s;o dreadful, had not as yet entirely cru&s;hed the &s;pirit of the Scotch nation; and after a &s;hort in|terval, they began to breathe from their calamities. Wallace, who had gained all their regards by his va|lour, &s;hewed that he &s;till merited them more by his declining the rewards of ambition. Perceiving how much he was envied by the nobility, and know|ing how prejudicial that envy would prove to the in|tere&s;ts of his country, he re&s;igned the regency of the kingdom, and humbled him&s;elf to a private &s;tation. He propo&s;ed Cummin as the propere&s;t per&s;on to &s;up|ply his room; and that nobleman endeavoured to &s;hew him&s;elf worthy of this pre-eminence. He &s;oon began to annoy the enemy; and not content with a defen&s;ive war, made incur&s;ions into the &s;outhern counties of the kingdom, which Edward had ima|gined wholly &s;ubdued. They attacked an army of the Engli&s;h lying at Ro&s;lin, near Edinburgh, and gained a complete victory.</P>
<P>But it was not ea&s;y for any circum&s;tances of bad fortune to repre&s;s the enterprizing &s;pirit of the king. He a&s;&s;embled a great &s;leet and army; and, entering
<PB N="78" REF="84">
the frontiers of Scotland, appeared with a force which the enemy could not think of re&s;i&s;ting in the open field. A&s;&s;ured of &s;ucce&s;s, he marched along, and traver&s;ed the kingdom from one end to the other, ravaging the open country, taking all the ca&s;tles, and receiving the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions of all the nobles. There &s;eemed to remain only one ob&s;tacle to the final de|&s;truction of the Scotti&s;h monarchy, and that was William Wallace, who &s;till continued refractory; and wandering with a few forces from mountain to moun|tain, pre&s;erved his native independence and u&s;ual good fortune. But even their feeble hopes from him were &s;oon di&s;appointed; he was betrayed into the king's hands by Sir John Monteith, his friend, whom he had made acquainted with the place of his con|cealment, being &s;urprized by him as he lay a&s;leep in the neighbourhood of Gla&s;gow. The king, willing to &s;trike the Scotch with an example of &s;everity, or|dered him to be conducted in chains to London, where he was hanged, drawn and quartered, with the mo&s;t brutal ferocity.</P>
<P>Robert Bruce, who had been one of the compe|titors for the crown, but was long kept a pri&s;oner in London, at length e&s;caping from his guards, re&s;olved to &s;trike for his countries freedom. Having murdered one of the king's &s;ervants, he left him&s;elf no re&s;ource, but to confirm, by de&s;perate valour, what he had be|gun in cruelty; and he &s;oon expelled &s;uch of the Engli&s;h forces, as had fixed them&s;elves in the king|dom. Soon after, he was &s;olemnly crowned king, by the bi&s;hop of St. Andrew's, in the abbey of Scone; and numbers flocked to his &s;tandard, re&s;olved to con|firm his preten&s;ions. Thus, after twice conquering the kingdom, and as often pardoning the delinquents; after having &s;pread his victories in every quarter of the country, and receiving the mo&s;t humble &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ions, the old king &s;aw, that his whole work was to begin afre&s;h; and that nothing but the final de&s;truc|tion
<PB N="79" REF="85">
of the inhabitants could give him a&s;&s;urance of tranquility. But no difficulties could repre&s;s the ar|duous &s;pirit of this monarch, who, tho' now verging towards his decline, yet re&s;olved to &s;trike a parting blow, and to make the Scotch once more tremble at his appearance. He vowed revenge again&s;t the whole nation; and averred, that nothing but reducing them to the complete&s;t bondage could &s;atisfy his re&s;ent|ment. He &s;ummoned his prelates, nobility, and all who held by knights &s;ervice, to meet him at Car|li&s;le, which was appointed as the general rendez|vous; and, in the mean time, he detached a body of forces before him into Scotland, under the command of Aymer de Valence, who began the threatened infliction by a terrible victory over Bruce, near Me|thuen, in Perth&s;hire. Immediately after this dread|ful blow, the re&s;entful king him&s;elf appeared in per|&s;on, entering Scotland with his army divided into two parts, and expecting to find, in the oppo&s;ition of the people, a pretext for puni&s;hing them. But this brave prince, who was never cruel but from motives of policy, could not &s;trike the poor &s;ubmitting na|tives, who made no re&s;i&s;tance. His anger was di&s;|appointed in their humiliations; and he was a&s;hamed to extirpate tho&s;e who only oppo&s;ed patience to his indignation. His death put an end to the apprehen|&s;ions of the Scotch, and effectually re&s;cued their country from total &s;ubjection. He &s;ickened, and died at Carli&s;le, of a dy&s;entery; enjoining his &s;on, with his la&s;t breath, to pro&s;ecute the enterprize, and never to de&s;i&s;t, till he had finally &s;ubdued the king|dom. He expired, July 7, 1307, in the &s;ixty-ninth year of his age, and the thirty-fifth of his reign: after having added more to the &s;olid intere&s;ts of the kingdom, than any of tho&s;e who went before, or &s;ucceeded him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. EDWARD II. &s;urnamed of CAERNARVON.</HEAD>
<P>EDWARD was in the twenty-third year of his age when he &s;ucceeded his father, of an a|greeable figure, of a mild harmle&s;s di&s;po&s;ition, and apparently addicted to few vices. But he &s;oon gave &s;ymptoms of his unfitne&s;s to &s;ucceed &s;o great a mo|narch as his father; he was rather fond of the enjoy|ment of his power, than of &s;ecuring it; and, lulled by the flattery of his courtiers, he thought he had done enough for glory, when he had accepted the crown. In&s;tead therefore of pro&s;ecuting the war a|gain&s;t Scotland, according to the injunctions he had received from his dying father, he took no &s;teps to check the progre&s;s of Bruce; his march into that country being rather a proce&s;&s;ion of pageantry, than a warlike expedition.</P>
<P>Weak monarchs are ever governed by favourites, and the fir&s;t Edward placed his affections upon was Piers Gave&s;tone, the &s;on of a Ga&s;con knight, who had been employed in the &s;ervice of the late king. This young man was adorned with every accom|pli&s;hment of per&s;on and mind, that were capable of creating affection: but he was utterly de&s;titute of tho&s;e qualities of heart and under&s;tanding that &s;erve to procure e&s;teem. He was beautiful, witty, brave, and active; but then he was vicious, effeminate, de|bauched, and trifling. The&s;e were qualities entirely adapted to the ta&s;te of the young monarch, and he &s;eemed to think no rewards equal to his de&s;erts. Ga|ve&s;tone on the other hand intoxicated with his power, became haughty and overbearing, and treated the Engli&s;h nobility, from whom it is probable he received marks of contempt, with &s;corn and deri&s;ion. A
<PB N="81" REF="87">
con&s;piracy, therefore, was &s;oon formed again&s;t him, at the head of which queen I&s;abel, and the earl of Lanca&s;ter, a nobleman of great power, were a&s;&s;ociated.</P>
<P>It was ea&s;y to perceive, that a combination of the nobles, while the queen &s;ecretly a&s;&s;i&s;ted their de&s;igns, would be too powerful again&s;t the efforts of a weak king, and a vain favourite. The king timid and wavering, bani&s;hed him at their &s;olicitation, and re|called him &s;oon after. This was &s;ufficient to &s;pread an alarm over the whole kingdom;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1312.</NOTE> all the great barons flew to arms; and the earl of Lanca&s;ter put him&s;elf at the head of this irre&s;i&s;tible confederacy. The unhappy Edward, in|&s;tead of attempting to make re&s;i&s;tance, &s;ought only for &s;afety: ever happy in the company of his fa|vourite, he embarked at Tinmouth, and &s;ailed with him to Scarborough, where he left Gave&s;tone, as in a place of &s;afety; and then went back to York him&s;elf, either to rai&s;e an army to oppo&s;e his enemies; or, by his pre&s;ence, to allay their ani|mo&s;ity. In the mean time, Gave&s;tone was be|&s;ieged in Scarborough by the earl of Pembroke; and had the garri&s;on been &s;ufficiently &s;upplied with pro|vi&s;ions, that place would have been impregnable. But Gave&s;tone, &s;en&s;ible of the bad condition of the garri&s;on, took the earlie&s;t opportunity to offer terms of capitulation. He &s;tipulated, that he &s;hould re|main in Pembroke's hands as a pri&s;oner for two months; and that endeavours &s;hould be u&s;ed, in the mean time, for a general accommodation. But Pem|broke had no intention that he &s;hould e&s;cape &s;o ea&s;ily; he ordered him to be conducted to the ca&s;tle of Deddington, near Banbury, where, on pretence of other bu&s;ine&s;s, he left him with a feeble guard, which the earl of Warwick having notice of, he attacked the ca&s;tle in which the unfortunate Gave&s;tone was confined, and quickly made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of his per&s;on. The earls of Lanca&s;ter, Hereford, and Arun|del, were &s;oon apprized of Warwick's &s;ucce&s;s, and
<PB N="82" REF="88">
informed that their common enemy was now in cu&s;|tody in Warwick ca&s;tle. Thither, therefore, they ha&s;ted with the utmo&s;t expedition, to hold a con&s;ulta|tion upon the fate of their pri&s;oner. This was of no long continuance; they unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved to put him to death, as an enemy to the kingdom, and gave him no time to prepare for his execution. They in|&s;tantly had him conveyed to a place called Blacklow-hill, where a Wel&s;h executioner, provided for that purpo&s;e, &s;evered his head from the body.</P>
<P>To add to Edward's misfortunes, he &s;oon after &s;uf|fered a mo&s;t terrible defeat from the Scotch army un|der Bruce, near Banochburn, and this drove him once more to &s;eek for relief in &s;ome favourite's com|pany. The name of this new favourite was Hugh De&s;pen&s;er, a young man of a noble Engli&s;h family, of &s;ome merit, and very engaging accompli&s;hments. His father was a per&s;on of a much more e&s;timable character than the &s;on; he was venerable for his years, and re&s;pected through life for his wi&s;dom, his valour, and his integrity. But the&s;e excellent quali|ties were all dimini&s;hed and vilified, from the mo|ment he and his &s;on began to &s;hare the king's favour, who even di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome lords unju&s;tly of their e&s;tates, in order to accumulate them upon his favour|ite. This was a pretext the king's enemies had been long &s;eeking for; the earls of Lanca&s;ter and Hereford flew to arms; &s;entence was procured from parlia|ment of perpetual exile again&s;t the two Spen&s;ers, and a forfeiture of their fortune and e&s;tates. The king however, at la&s;t rou&s;ing from his lethargy, took the field in the defence of his beloved Spen&s;er, and at the head of thirty thou&s;and men pre&s;&s;ed the earl of Lan|ca&s;ter &s;o clo&s;ely, that he had not time to collect his forces together; and flying from one place to another, he was at la&s;t &s;topt in his way towards Scotland by Sir Andrew Harcla, and made pri&s;oner. As he had formerly &s;hewn little mercy to Gave&s;tone, there was
<PB N="83" REF="89">
very little extended to him upon this occa&s;ion. He was condemned by a court-martial; and led, mount|ed on a lean hor&s;e, to an eminence near Pomfret, in circum&s;tances of the greate&s;t indignity, where he was beheaded by a Londoner.</P>
<P>A rebellion, thus cru&s;hed, &s;erved only to encrea&s;e the pride and rapacity of young Spen&s;er: mo&s;t of the forfeitures were &s;eized for his u&s;e; and in his promp|titude to puni&s;h the delinquents, he was found guilty of many acts of rapine and inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>But he was now to oppo&s;e a more formidable ene|my in queen I&s;abella, a cruel haughty woman, who fled over to France, and refu&s;ed to appear in England till Spen&s;er was removed from the royal pre&s;ence and bani&s;hed the kingdom. By this reply &s;he gained two very con&s;iderable advantages; &s;he became popular in England, where Spen&s;er was univer&s;ally di&s;liked; and &s;he had the plea&s;ure of enjoying the company of a young nobleman, who&s;e name was Mortimer, upon whom &s;he had lately placed her affections, and whom &s;he indulged with all the familiarities that her crimi|nal pa&s;&s;ion could confer. The queen's court now, therefore, became a &s;anctuary for all the male-con|tents who were bani&s;hed their own country, or who cho&s;e to come over. Accordingly &s;oon after, accom|panied by three thou&s;and men at arms, &s;he &s;et out from Dort harbour, and landed &s;afely, without oppo|&s;ition, on the coa&s;t of Suffolk. She no &s;ooner ap|peared, than there &s;eemed a general revolt in her &s;a|vour; and the unfortunate king found the &s;pirit of di&s;loyalty was not confined to the capital alone, but di&s;|fu&s;ed over the whole kingdom. He had placed &s;ome de|pendence upon the garri&s;on which was &s;tationed in the ca&s;tle of Bri&s;tol, under the command of the elder Spen&s;er; but they mutinied again&s;t their governor, and that unfortunate favourite was delivered up, and condemned by the tumultuous barons to the mo&s;t ig|nomimous death. He was hanged on a gibbet in his
<PB N="84" REF="90">
armour, his body was cut in pieces, and thrown to the dogs, and his head was &s;ent to Winche&s;ter, where it was &s;et on a pole, and expo&s;ed to the in&s;ults of the populace.</P>
<P>Young Spen&s;er, the unhappy &s;on, did not long &s;urvive the father; he was taken, with &s;ome others who had followed the fortunes of the wretched king, in an ob&s;cure convent in Wales, and the mercile&s;s victors re&s;olved to glut their revenge, in adding in&s;ult to cruelty. The queen had not patience to wait the formality of a trial; but ordered him immediately to be led forth before the in&s;ulting populace, and &s;eem|ed to take a &s;avage plea&s;ure in fea&s;ting her eyes with his di&s;tre&s;&s;es. The gibbet erected for his execution was fifty feet high; his head was &s;ent to London, where the citizens received it in brutal triumph, and fixed it on the bridge. Several other lords al&s;o &s;hared his fate; all de&s;erving pity indeed, had they not them|&s;elves formerly ju&s;tified the pre&s;ent inhumanity by &s;etting a cruel example.</P>
<P>In the mean time the king, who hoped to find re|fuge in Wales, quickly was di&s;covered, and delivered up to his adver&s;aries, who expre&s;&s;ed their &s;atisfaction in the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of their treatment. He was conducted to the capital, amid&s;t the in&s;ults and reproaches of the people, and confined in the Tower. A charge was &s;oon after exhibited again&s;t him; in which no other crimes but his incapacity to govern, his indolence, his love of plea&s;ure, and his being &s;wayed by evil coun&s;ellors, were objected again&s;t him. His depo|&s;ition was quickly voted by parliament; he was a&s;|&s;igned a pen&s;ion for his &s;upport, his &s;on Edward, a youth of fourteen, was fixed upon to &s;ucceed him, and the queen was appointed regent during the mi|nority.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1327.</NOTE>The depo&s;ed monarch but a &s;hort time &s;ur|vived his misfortunes; he was &s;ent from pri|&s;on to pri&s;on, a wretched outca&s;t, and the &s;port of his inhuman keepers. He had been at fir&s;t
<PB N="85" REF="91">
con&s;igned to the cu&s;tody of the earl of Lanca&s;ter; but this nobleman, &s;hewing &s;ome marks of re&s;pect and pity, he was taken out of his hands, and delivered over to lord Berkeley, Montravers, and Gournay, who were entru&s;t|ed with the charge of guarding him month about. What|ever his treatment from lord Berkeley might have been, the other two &s;eemed re&s;olved that he &s;hould enjoy none of the comforts of life, while in their cu&s;tody. They practi&s;ed every kind of indignity upon him, as if their de&s;ign had been to accelerate his death by the bitter|ne&s;s of his &s;ufferings. Among other acts of brutal oppre&s;&s;ion, it is &s;aid, that they &s;haved him for &s;port in the open fields, u&s;ing water from a neighbouring ditch. He is &s;aid to have borne his former indigni|ties with patience, but all fortitude for&s;ook him upon this occa&s;ion; he looked upon his mercile&s;s in&s;ulters with an air of fallen maje&s;ty, and bur&s;ting into tears, exclaimed, that the time might come, when he would be more decently attended. This, however, was but a vain expectation. As his per&s;ecutors &s;aw that his death might not arrive, even under every cruelty, till a revolution had been made in his favour, they re&s;olved to rid them&s;elves of their fears, by de&s;troying him at once. Acordingly, his two keepers, Gournay and Montravers, came to Berkeley ca&s;tle, where Ed|ward was then confined; and having concerted a method of putting him to death without any external violence, they threw him on a bed, holding him down by a table, which they had placed over him. They then ran an horn pipe up his body, through which they conveyed a red hot iron; and thus burnt his bowels, without disfiguring his body. By this cruel artifice, they expected to have their crime conceal|ed; but his horrid &s;hrieks, which were heard at a di&s;tance from the ca&s;tle, &s;oon gave a &s;u&s;picion of the murder; and the whole was &s;oon after divulged by the confe&s;&s;ion of one of the accomplices. Misfortunes like his mu&s;t ever create pity; and a puni&s;hment &s;o
<PB N="86" REF="92">
di&s;proportionate to the &s;ufferer's guilt, mu&s;t wipe away even many of tho&s;e faults of which Edward was ju&s;tly culpable.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. EDWARD III.</HEAD>
<P>THE parliament, by which young Edward was rai&s;ed to the throne, during the life of his fa|ther, appointed twelve per&s;ons as his privy-council, to direct the operations of government. Mortimer, the quen's paramour, who might naturally be &s;et down as one of the members, artfully excluded him|&s;elf, under a pretended &s;hew of moderation; but at the &s;ame time he &s;ecretly influenced all the mea&s;ures that came beneath their deliberation. He cau&s;ed the greate&s;t part of the royal revenues to be &s;ettled on the queen dowager, and he &s;eldom took the trouble to con&s;ult the mini&s;ters of government in any public undertaking. The king him&s;elf was &s;o be&s;ieged by the favourite's creatures, that no acce&s;s could be pro|cured to him, and the whole &s;overeign authority was &s;hared between Mortimer and the queen, who took no care to conceal her criminal attachment.</P>
<P>At length, however, Edward was re&s;olved to &s;hake off an authority that was odious to the nation, and particularly re&s;trictive upon him. But &s;uch was the power of the favourite, that it required as much pre|caution to overturn the u&s;urper, as to e&s;tabli&s;h the throne. The queen and Mortimer had for &s;ome time cho&s;en the ca&s;tle of Nottingham for the place of their re&s;idence; it was &s;trictly guarded, the gates locked every evening, and the keys carried to the queen. It was, there|fore, agreed between the king, and &s;ome of his barons, who &s;ecretly entered into his de&s;igns, to &s;eize upon them in the fortre&s;s; and for that purpo&s;e, Sir
<PB N="87" REF="93">
William Eland, the governor, was induced to admit them by a &s;ecret &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age, which had been formerly contrived for an outlet, but was now hidden with rubbi&s;h, and known only to one or two. It was by this, therefore, the noblemen in the king's inter|e&s;ts entered the ca&s;tle in the night; and Mortimer, without having it in his power to make any re&s;i&s;tance, was &s;eized in an apartment adjoining that of the queen's. It was in vain that &s;he endeavoured to pro|tect him; in vain &s;he entreated them to &s;pare her "gentle Mortimer;" the barons, deaf to her entreat|ies, denied her that pity, which &s;he had &s;o often re|fu&s;ed to others. Her paramour was condemned by the parliament, which was then &s;itting, without be|ing permitted to make his defence, or even examin|ing a witne&s;s again&s;t him. He was hanged on a gib|bet at a place called Elmes, about a mile from Lon|don, where his body was left hanging for two days after. The queen, who was certainly the mo&s;t cul|pable, was &s;hielded by the dignity of her &s;ituation; &s;he was only di&s;carded from all &s;hare of power, and confined for life, to the ca&s;tle of Ri&s;ings, with a pen|&s;ion of three thou&s;and pounds a year. From this confinement, &s;he was never after &s;et free; and though the king annually paid her a vi&s;it of decent cere|mony, yet &s;he found her&s;elf abandoned to univer&s;al contempt and dete&s;tation; and continued for above twenty-five years after a mi&s;erable monument of bla&s;t|ed ambition.</P>
<P>In order &s;till more to &s;ecure the people's affections, Edward made a &s;ucce&s;sful irruption into Scotland, in which in one battle &s;ought at Hallidown hill, above thirty thou&s;and of the Scotch were &s;lain. Soon after he turned his arms again&s;t France, which was at that time particularly unfortunate. The three &s;ons of Philip the Fair, in full parliament, accu&s;ed their wives of adultery; and in con&s;equence of this accu&s;ation they were condemned and impri&s;oned for life. Lew|is
<PB N="88" REF="94" MS="y">
Hutin, &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the crown of France, cau&s;ed his wife to be &s;trangled, and her lovers to be flead alive. After his death, as he left only a daughter, his next brother, Philip the Tall, a&s;&s;umed the crown, in prejudice of the daughter; and vindicated his title by the Salic law, which laid it down, that no female &s;hould &s;ucceed to the crown. Edward however, urged his preten&s;ions, as being by his mother I&s;abella, who was daughter to Philip the Fair, and &s;i&s;ter to the three la&s;t kings of France, rightful heir to the crown. But fir&s;t, he in a formal manner, con&s;ulted his parliament on the propriety of the undertaking, obtained their approbation, received a proper &s;upply of wool, which he intended to barter with the Flem|ings; and being attended with a body of Engli&s;h forces, and &s;everal of his nobility, he &s;ailied over into Flanders, big with his intended conque&s;ts.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t great advantage gained by the Engli&s;h was in a naval engagement on the coa&s;t of Flanders, in which the French lo&s;t two hundred and thirty &s;hips, and had thirty thou&s;and of their &s;eamen, and two of their admirals &s;lain.</P>
<P>The intelligence of Edward's landing, and the de|va&s;tation cau&s;ed by his troops, who di&s;per&s;ed them|&s;elves over the whole face of the country, &s;oon &s;pread univer&s;al con&s;ternation through the French court. Caen was taken and plundered by the Engli&s;h, with|out mercy; the villages and towns, even up to Paris, &s;hared the &s;ame fate; and the French had no other re|&s;ource but by breaking down their bridges, to attempt putting a &s;top to the invader's career. Philip, then king of France, was not idle in making preparations to repre&s;s the enemy. He had &s;tationed one of his gneerals, Godemar de Faye, with an army on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river Somme, over which Edward was to pa&s;s; while he him&s;elf, at the head of an hundred thou&s;and fighting men, advanced to give the Engli&s;h battle.</P>
<P>As both armies had for &s;ome time been in &s;ight of each other, nothing was &s;o eagerly expected on each
<PB N="89" REF="95">
&s;ide as a battle; and although the forces were ex|tremely di&s;proportioned, the Engli&s;h amounting only to thirty thou&s;and, the French to an hundred and twenty thou&s;and; yet Edward re&s;olved to indulge the impetuo&s;ity of his troops, and put all to the hazard of a battle. He accordingly cho&s;e his ground with ad|vantage near the village of Crecy; and there deter|mined to await with tranquility the &s;hock of the ene|my. He drew up his men on a gentle a&s;cent, and divided them into three lines. The fir&s;t was com|manded by the young prince of Wales; the &s;econd was conducted by the earls of Northampton and Arundel; and the third, which was kept as a body of re&s;erve, was headed by the king in per&s;on.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide, Philip, impelled by re&s;entment, and confident of his numbers, was more &s;olicitous in bring|ing the enemy to an engagement, than prudent in tak|ing mea&s;ures for its &s;ucce&s;s. He led on his army in three bodies oppo&s;ite tho&s;e of the Engli&s;h. The fir&s;t line con&s;i&s;ted of fifteen thou&s;and Genoe&s;e cro&s;s-bow|men. The &s;econd body was led by the king of France's brother; and he him&s;elf was at the head of the third.</P>
<P>About three in the afternoon, the famous battle of Crecy began, by the French king's ordering the Gen|oe&s;e archers to charge; but they were &s;o fatigued with their march, that they cried out for a little re&s;t before they &s;hould engage. The count Alen&ccedil;on, be|ing informed of their petition, rode up and reviled them as cowards, commanding them to begin the on&s;et without delay. Their reluctance to begin, was &s;till more encrea&s;ed by a heavy &s;hower which fell that in&s;tant, and relaxed their bow &s;trings; &s;o that the di&s;charge they made, produced but very little effect. On the other hand, the Engli&s;h archers, who bad kept their bows in ca&s;es, and were favoured by a &s;udden gleam of &s;un&s;hine, that rather dazzled the enemy, let fly their arrows &s;o thick, and with &s;uch good aim, that nothing was to be &s;een among the
<PB N="90" REF="96">
Genoe&s;e but hurry, terror, and di&s;may. The young prince of Wales had pre&s;ence of mind to take advan|tage of their confu&s;ion, and to lead on his line to the charge. The French cavalry, however, com|manded by the count Alen&ccedil;on, wheeling round &s;u&s;|tained the combat, and began to hem the Engli&s;h in. The earls of Arundel and Northampton, now came to a&s;&s;i&s;t the prince, who appeared foremo&s;t in the very &s;hock; and wherever he appeared turn|ing the fortune of the day. The thicke&s;t of the bat|tle was now gathered round him, and the valour of a boy filled even veterans with a&s;toni&s;hment; but their &s;urprize at his courage could not give way to their fears for his &s;afety. Being apprehen&s;ive that &s;ome mi&s;chance might happen to him in the end, an officer was di&s;patched to the king, de&s;iring that &s;uccours might be &s;ent to the prince's relief. Edward, who had all this time, with great tranquility, viewed the engagement from a wind-mill, demanded with &s;eem|ing deliberation if his &s;on were dead; but being an|&s;wered that he &s;till lived, and was giving a&s;toni&s;hing in&s;tances of valour; "then tell my generals, cried the king, that he &s;hall have no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from me; the honour of this day &s;hall be his, let him &s;hew him&s;elf worthy the profe&s;&s;ion of arms, and let him be indebt|ed to his own merit alone for victory." This &s;peech, being reported to the prince and his attendants, it in&s;pired them with new courage; they made a fre&s;h attack upon the French cavalry, and count Alen&ccedil;on, their brave&s;t commander, was &s;lain. This was the begining of their total overthrow: the French being now without a competent leader, were thrown into confu&s;ion; their whole army took to flight, and were put to the &s;word by the pur&s;uers without mercy, till night &s;topped the carnage. Never was a victory more &s;ea&s;onable, or le&s;s bloody to the Engli&s;h than this. Notwith&s;tanding the great &s;laughter of the
<PB N="91" REF="97">
enemy, the conquerors lo&s;t but one e&s;quire, three knights, and a few of inferior rank.</P>
<P>But this victory was attended with &s;till more &s;ub|&s;tantial advantages; for Edward, as moderate in con|que&s;t, as prudent in his methods to obtain it, re&s;olv|ed to &s;ecure an ea&s;y entrance into France for the future. With this view he laid &s;iege to Calais, that was then defended by John de Vienne, an experien|ced commander, and &s;upplied with every thing nece&s;|&s;ary for defence. The&s;e operations, though &s;low, were at lengh &s;ucce&s;sful. It was in vain that the go|vernor made a noble defence, that he excluded all the u&s;ele&s;s mouths from the city, which Edward gener|ou&s;ly permitted to pa&s;s. Edward re&s;olved to reduce it by famine, and it was at length taken after a twelve-month's &s;iege, the defendants having been reduced to the la&s;t extremity. He re&s;olved to puni&s;h the ob|&s;tinacy of the town&s;men, by the death of &s;ix of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable citizens, who offered them&s;elves, with ropes round their necks, to &s;atiate his indignation; but he &s;pared their lives, at the interce&s;&s;ion of the queen.</P>
<P>While Edward was reaping victories upon the con|tinent, the Scotch, ever willing to embrace a favour|able opportunity of rapine and revenge, invaded the frontiers with a numerous army, headed by David Bruce their king. This unexpected inva&s;ion, at &s;uch a juncture, alarmed the Engli&s;h, but was not capable of intimidating them. Lionel, Edward's &s;on, who was left guardian of England during his father's ab|&s;ence, was yet too young to take upon him the com|mand of an army; but the victories on the continent &s;eemed to in&s;pire even women with valour: Philippa, Edward's queen, took upon her the conduct of the field, and prepared to re|pul&s;e the enemy in per&s;on. According|ly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1346.</NOTE> having made lord Percy general under her, &s;he met the Scots at a place called Nevill's Cro&s;s near Durham, and offered them bat|tle.
<PB N="92" REF="98">
The Scotch king was no le&s;s impatient to en|gage; he imagined that he might obtain an ea&s;y vic|tory again&s;t undi&s;ciplined troops and headed by a wo|man. But he was mi&s;erably deceived. His army was quickly routed and driven from the field. Fif|teen thou&s;and of his men were cut to pieces; and he him&s;elf, with many of his nobles and knights, were taken pri&s;oners, and carried in triumph to London.</P>
<P>A victory gained by the Black Prince near Poictiers followed not long after, in which John king of France was taken pri&s;oner, and led in triumph through Lon|don amid&s;t an amazing concour&s;e of &s;pectators. Two kings pri&s;oners in the &s;ame court, and at the &s;ame time, were con&s;idered as glorious atchievements; but all that England gained by them was only glory. What|ever was won in France, with all the dangers of war, and the expence of preparation, was &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and in a manner &s;ilently, lo&s;t, without the mortification of a defeat.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h, by their frequent &s;upplies, had been quite exhau&s;ted, and were unable to continue an army in the field. Charles, who had &s;ucceeded his father John, who died a pri&s;oner in the Savoy, on the other hand, cautiou&s;ly forbore coming to any de|ci&s;ive engagement; but was contented to let his enemies wa&s;te their &s;trength in attempts to plunder a fortified country. When they were retired, he then was &s;ure to &s;ally forth, and po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of &s;uch pla|ces as they were not &s;trong enough to defend. He fir&s;t fell upon Ponthieu; the citizens of Abbeville opened their gates to him; tho&s;e of St. Valois, Rue, and Crotoy, imitated the example; and the whole country was, in a little time, reduced to total &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion. The &s;outhern provinces were, in the &s;ame manner, invaded by his generals with equal &s;ucce&s;s; while the Black Prince, de&s;titute of &s;upplies from England, and wa&s;ted by a cruel and con&s;umptive di&s;order, was obliged to return to his native coun|try,
<PB N="93" REF="99">
leaving the affairs of the &s;outh of France in a mo&s;t de&s;perate condition.</P>
<P>But what of all other things &s;erved to gloom the latter part of this &s;plendid reign, was the approaching death of the Black Prince, who&s;e con&s;titution &s;hewed but too manife&s;ty the &s;ymptoms of a &s;peedy di&s;&s;olution. This valiant and accompli&s;hed prince died in the forty-&s;ixth year of his age, leaving behind him a cha|racter without a &s;ingle blemi&s;h; and a degree of &s;orrow among the people, that time could &s;carcely alleviate.</P>
<P>The king was mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly affected with the lo&s;s of his &s;on; and tried every art to allay his un|ea&s;ine&s;s. He removed him&s;elf entirely from the du|ties and burdens of the &s;tate, and left his kingdom to be plundered by a &s;et of rapacious mini&s;ters. He did not &s;urvive the con&s;equences of his bad conduct; but died about a year after the prince, at Shene, in Surry, de&s;erted by all his courtiers, even by tho&s;e who had grown rich by his bounty. He expired in the &s;ixty-fifth year of his age and fifty fir&s;t of his reign, 1377; a prince more admired than beloved by his &s;ubjects, and more an object of their applau&s;e, than their &s;orrow.</P>
<P>It was in this reign that the order of the garter was in&s;tituted;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1340.</NOTE> the number was to con&s;i&s;t of twenty four per&s;ons be&s;ide the king. A &s;tory prevails, but un&s;upport|ed by any ancient authority, that the counte&s;s of Sali&s;bury, at a ball, happening to drop her garter, the king took it up, and pre&s;ented it to her with the&s;e words, "Honi &s;oit qui mal y pen&s;e;" Evil be to him that evil thinks. This accident it is &s;aid gave ri&s;e to the order and the motto.</P>
<P>Edward left many children by his queen Philippa of Hainault: his elde&s;t &s;on, the Black P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ince, died before him, but he left a &s;on, named Richard, who &s;ucceeded to the throne.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. RICHARD II.</HEAD>
<P>RICHARD II. was but eleven years old when he came to the throne of his grandfather, and found the people di&s;contented and poor, the nobles proud and rebellious. As he was a minor, the go|vernment was ve&s;ted in the hands of his three un|cles, the dukes of Lanca&s;ter, York, and Glouce&s;ter; and as the late king had left the kingdom involved in many dangerous and expen&s;ive wars, which demand|ed large and con&s;tant &s;upplies, the murmurs of the people encrea&s;ed in proportion. The expences of armaments to face the enemy on every &s;ide, and a want of oeconomy in the admini&s;tration, entirely ex|hau&s;ted the trea&s;ury; and a new tax of three groats on every per&s;on above fifteen, was granted by parlia|ment as a &s;upply. The indignation of the people had been for &s;ome time encrea&s;ing; but a tax &s;o un|equitable, in which the rich paid no more than the poor, kindled the re&s;entment of the latter into flame. It began in E&s;&s;ex, where a report was indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread, that the pea&s;ants were to be de&s;troyed, their hou&s;es burned, and their farms plundered. A black-&s;mith, well known by the name of Wat Tyler, was the fir&s;t that excited them to arms. The tax gather|ers coming to this man's hou&s;e while he was at work, demanded payment for his daughter, which he re|fu&s;ed, alledging &s;he was under the age mentioned in the act. One of the brutal collectors in&s;i&s;ted on her being a full grown woman; and immediately attempt|ed a very indecent proof of his a&s;&s;ertion. This pro|voked the father to &s;uch a degree, that he in&s;tantly &s;truck him dead with a blow of his hammer. The &s;tanders by applauded his &s;pirit, and, one and all,
<PB N="95" REF="101">
re&s;olved to defend his conduct. He was con&s;idered as a champion in the cau&s;e, and appointed the leader and &s;poke&s;man of the people. It is ea&s;y to imagine the di&s;orders committed by this tumultuous rabble; the whole neighbourhood ro&s;e in arms; they burnt and plundered wherever they came, and revenged upon their former ma&s;ters, all tho&s;e in&s;ults which they had long &s;u&s;tained with impunity. As the di&s;|content was general, the in&s;urgents encrea&s;ed in pro|portion as they approached the capital. The flame &s;oon propagated it&s;elf into Kent, Hertford&s;hire, Surry, Su&s;&s;ex, Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridge, and Lincoln. They were found to amount to above an hundred thou&s;and men, by the time they were arrived at Blackheath. At the head of one party of the&s;e was Wat Tyler, who led his men into Smithfield, where he was met by the king, who invited him to a con|ference, under a pretence of hearing and redre&s;&s;ing his grievances. Tyler ordering his companions to retire, till he &s;hould give them a &s;ignal, boldly ven|tured to meet the king in the mid&s;t of his retinue, and accordingly began the conference. The de|mands of this demagogue are cen&s;ured by all the hi&s;|torians of the time, as in&s;olent and extravagant; and yet nothing can be more ju&s;t than tho&s;e they have delivered for him. He required that all &s;laves &s;hould be &s;et free; that all commonages &s;hould be open to the poor as well as rich; and that a general pardon &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed for the late outrages. Whil&s;t he made the&s;e demands, he now and then lifted up his &s;word in a menacing manner; which in&s;olence &s;o rai&s;ed the in|dignation of William Walworth, then mayor of Lon|don, attending on the king, that, without con&s;ider|ing the danger to which he expo&s;ed his maje&s;ty, he &s;tunned Tyler with a blow of his mace; while one of the king's knights, riding up, di&s;patched him with his &s;word. The mutineers, &s;eeing their leader fall, prepar|ed them&s;elves to take revenge; and their bows were now
<PB N="96" REF="102">
bent for execution, when Richard, though not yet quite &s;ixteen years of age, rode up to the rebels, and, with admirable pre&s;ence of mind, cried out, "What my people, will you then kill your king? Be not con|cerned for the lo&s;s of your leader; I my&s;elf will now be your general; follow me into the field, and you &s;hall have whatever you de&s;ire." The awed multi|tude immediatly de&s;i&s;ted; they followed the king as if mechanically into the fields, and there he granted them the &s;ame charter that he had before given to their companions, but which he &s;oon after revoked in parliament.</P>
<P>Hitherto the king had acted under the controle of the regency, who did all they could devi&s;e to abridge his power; however, in an extraordinary council of the nobility, a&s;&s;embled after Ea&s;ter, he, to the a&s;to|ni&s;hment of all pre&s;ent, de&s;ired to know his age; and being told that he was turned of two and twenty, he alledged, that it was time then for him to govern without help; and that there was no rea&s;on that he &s;hould be deprived of tho&s;e rights which the mean|e&s;t of his &s;ubjects enjoyed.</P>
<P>Being thus left at liberty to conduct the bu&s;ine&s;s of government at di&s;cretion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1389.</NOTE> it quickly appeared that he wanted tho&s;e arts that are u&s;ually found to procure a la&s;ting re&s;pect; he was fond of luxurious plea&s;ures and idle o&s;tentation; he admitted the meane&s;t ranks to his familiarity; and his conver&s;ation was not adapted to impre&s;s them with a reverence for his morals or abili|ties. The cruelty &s;hewn to the duke of Glouce&s;ter, who upon &s;light &s;u&s;picions was &s;ent to confinement in Calais, and there murdered in pri&s;on, with &s;ome other acts equally arbitrary, did not fail to encrea&s;e tho&s;e ani|mo&s;ities which had already taken deep root in the kingdom. The aggrandi&s;ement of &s;ome new favour|ites, contributed &s;till more to make the king odious; but though he &s;eemed re&s;olved, by all his actions, to &s;et his &s;ubjects again&s;t him, it was accident that

gave the occa&s;ion for his overthrow. The duke of Hereford appeared in parliament, and accu&s;ed the duke of Norfolk of having &s;poken &s;editious word a|gain&s;t his maje&s;ty, in a private conver&s;ation. Nor|folk denied the charge, gave Hereford the lie, and offered to prove his innocence by &s;ingle combat. As proofs were wanting for legal trial, the lords readily acquie&s;ced in that mode of determination; the time and place were appointed; and the whole nation waited with anxious &s;u&s;pen&s;e for the event. At length the day arrived on which this duel was to be fought, and the champions having ju&s;t began their career, the king &s;topped the combat, and ordered both the combatants to leave the kingdom. The duke of Norfolk he bani&s;hed for life, but the duke of Hereford only for ten years. Thus the one was condemned to exile without being charged with any offence, and the other without being convicted of any crime. The duke of Norfolk was overwhelmed with grief and de&s;pondence at the judgment awarded again&s;t him; he retired to Venice, where, in a little time after, he died of a broken heart. Hereford's behaviour on this occa&s;ion was re&s;igned and &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ive, which &s;o plea&s;ed the king, that he con&s;ented to &s;horten the date of his bani&s;hment four years; and he al&s;o granted him letters patent, en&s;uring him the enjoyment of any inheritance which &s;hould fall to him during his ab&s;ence; but upon the death of his father, the duke of Lanca&s;ter, which happened &s;hortly after, Richard revoked tho&s;e letters, and re|tained the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Lanca&s;ter e&s;tate to him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Such complicated injuries &s;erved to enflame the re&s;entment of Hereford again&s;t the king; and al|though he had hitherto concealed it, he now &s;et no bounds to his indignation, but even conceived a de&s;ire of dethroning a per&s;on who had &s;hewn him|&s;elf &s;o unworthy of power. Indeed no man could
<PB N="98" REF="107">
be better qualified for an enterprize of this nature than the earl of Hereford: he was cool, cautious, di&s;cerning, and re&s;olute. He had &s;erved with di&s;|tinction again&s;t the infidels of Lithuania; and he had thus joined to his other merits tho&s;e of piety and valour. He was &s;timulated by private injuries; and had alliances and fortune &s;ufficient to give weight to his mea&s;ures. He only waited for the ab&s;ence of the king from England to put his &s;chemes in execu|tion; and Richard's going over into Ireland to quell an in&s;urrection there was the opportunity he long had looked for.</P>
<P>Accordingly he in&s;tantly embarked at Nantz, with a retinue of &s;ixty per&s;ons; in three &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, and landed at Raven&s;pur in York&s;hire. The earl of Nor|thumberland, who had long been a malecontent, to|gether with Henry Percy, his &s;on, who, from his ardent valour, was &s;urnamed Hot&s;pur, immediately joined him with their forces. After this junction the concour&s;e of people coming to li&s;t under his ban|ner was &s;o great, that in a few days his army amounted to three&s;core thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e things were tran&s;acting in England, Richard continued in Ireland in perfect &s;ecurity. Contrary winds, for three weeks together, prevented his receiving any news of the rebellion which was begun in his native dominions; wherefore upon landing at Milford-haven with a body of twenty thou&s;and men, he &s;aw him&s;elf in a dreadful &s;ituation, in the mid&s;t of an enraged people, without any friend on whom to rely; and for&s;aken by tho&s;e, who, in the &s;un&s;hine of his power, had only contributed to fan his follies. His little army gradually began to de&s;ert him, till at la&s;t he found that he had not above &s;ix thou&s;and men, who followed his &s;tandard. Thus, not knowing whom to tru&s;t to, or where to turn, he &s;aw no other hopes of &s;afety, but to throw him&s;elf upon the genero&s;ity of his enemy, and to gain from
<PB N="99" REF="108">
pity what he could not obtain by arms. He, therefore, &s;ent Hereford word, that he was ready to &s;ubmit to whatever terms he thought proper to pre&s;cribe, and that he earne&s;tly de&s;ired a conference. For this pur|po&s;e, the earl appointed him to meet at a ca&s;tle with|in about ten miles of Che&s;ter, where he came the next day with his whole army. Richard, who the day before had been brought thither by the duke of Northumberland, de&s;crying his rival's approach from the walls, went down to receive him; while Here|ford, after &s;ome ceremony, entered the ca&s;tle in com|plete armour, only his head was bare, in compliment to the fallen king. Richard received him with that open air for which he had been remarkable, and kind|ly bade him welcome. "My lord, the king, return|ed the earl, with a cool re&s;pectful bow, I am come &s;ooner than you appointed, becau&s;e your people &s;ay, that for one and twenty years you have governed with rigour and indi&s;cretion. They are very ill &s;atis|fied with your conduct; but, if it plea&s;e God, I will help you to govern them better for the time to come."</P>
<P>To this declaration the king made no other an&s;wer, but, "Fair cou&s;in, &s;ince it plea&s;es you, it plea&s;es us likewi&s;e."</P>
<P>But Hereford's haughty an&s;wer was not the only mortification the unfortunate Richard was to endure. After a &s;hort conver&s;ation with &s;ome of the king's attendants, Hereford ordered the king's hor&s;es to be brought out of the &s;table; and two wretched ani|mals being produced, Richard was placed upon one, and his favourite, the earl of Sali&s;bury, upon the other. In this mean equipage they rode to Che&s;ter; and were conveyed to the ca&s;tle, with a great noi&s;e of trumpets, and through a va&s;t concour&s;e of people, who were no way moved at the &s;ight. In this man|ner he was led triumphantly along, from town to town, amid&s;t multitudes who &s;coffed at him and extolled his rival. Long live the good duke of Lanca&s;ter out
<PB N="100" REF="109">
deliverer! was the general cry; but as for the king, to u&s;e the pathetic words of the poet, "None cried God ble&s;s him." Thus after repeated indignites, he was confined a clo&s;e pri&s;oner in the Tower; there, if po&s;&s;ible, to undergo a &s;till greater variety of &s;tudied in&s;olence, and flagrant contempt. The wretched monarch, humbled in this manner, began to lo&s;e the pride of a king with the &s;plendours of royalty, and his &s;pirits funk to his circum&s;tances. There was no great difficulty, therefore, in inducing him to &s;ign a deed, by which he renounced his crown, as being unqualified for governing the kingdom. Upon this re&s;ignation Hereford founded his principal claim; but willing to fortify his preten&s;ions with every ap|pearance of ju&s;tice, he called a parliament, which was readily brought to approve and confirm his claims. A frivolous charge of thirty three articles was drawn up, and found valid again&s;t the king; upon which he was &s;olemnly depo&s;ed, and the earl of Hereford elected in his &s;tead, by the title of Henry IV. Thus began the conte&s;t between the hou&s;es of York and Lanca&s;ter; which, for &s;everal years after, deluged the kingdom with blood; and yet, in the end, con|tributed to &s;ettle and confirm the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>When Richard was depo&s;ed, the earl of Northum|berland made a motion in the hou&s;e of peers, de|manding the advice of parliament, with regard to the future treatment of the depo&s;ed king. To this they replied, that he &s;hould be impri&s;oned in &s;ome &s;ecure place, where his friends and partizans &s;hould not be able to find him. This was accordingly put in practice; but while he &s;till continued alive, the u&s;urper could not remain in &s;afety. Indeed &s;ome con&s;piracies and commotions, which followed &s;oon after, induced Henry to wi&s;h for Richard's death; incon&s;equence of which, one of tho&s;e a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins that are found in every court, ready to commit the mo&s;t horrid crimes for reward, went down to the place of

this unfortunate monarch's confinement, in the ca&s;tle of Pomfret, and, with eight of his followers, ru&s;hed into his apartment.

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. HENRY IV.</HEAD>
<P>HENRY &s;oon found that the throne of an u&s;urper is but a bed of thorns.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1399.</NOTE> Such violent animo&s;ities broke out among the barons in the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of his parlia|ment, that forty challenges were given and re|ceived, and forty gauntlets thrown down, as pled|ges of the &s;incerity of their re&s;entment. But though the&s;e commotions were &s;eemingly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by his moderation for that time, yet one con&s;piracy broke out after another, and were detected in the formation, or actually puni&s;hed in the field.</P>
<P>That formed again&s;t him by the earl of Northumberland was the mo&s;t formidable.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1402.</NOTE> It was in a &s;kirmi&s;h between the Scotch and
<PB N="102" REF="111">
Engli&s;h, that Archibald, earl of Douglas, with many of the Scotch nobility, were taken pri&s;oners by the earl of Northumberland, and carried to Aln|wick ca&s;tle. When Henry received intelligence of this victory, he &s;ent the earl orders not to ran|&s;om his pri&s;oners, as he intended to detain them, in order to encrea&s;e his demands, in making peace with Scotland. This me&s;&s;age was highly re&s;ented by the earl of Northumberland, who, by the laws of war that prevailed in that age, had a right to the ran|&s;om of all &s;uch as he had taken in battle. The com|mand was &s;till more irk&s;ome, as he con&s;idered the king as his debtor both for &s;ecurity and his crown. Accordingly, &s;tung with this &s;uppo&s;ed injury, he re|&s;olved to overturn a throne which he had the chief hand in e&s;tabli&s;hing. A &s;cheme was laid, in which the Scotch and Wel&s;h were to unite their forces, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t Northumberland in elevating Mortimer, as the true heir, to the crown of England. When all things were prepared for the intended in&s;urrection, the earl had the mortification to find him&s;elf unable to lead on the troops, being &s;eized with a &s;udden illne&s;s at Ber|wick. But the want of his pre&s;ence was well &s;up|plied by his &s;on Harry Percy, &s;urnamed Hot&s;pur, who took the command of the troops, and marched them towards Shrew&s;bury, in order to join his forces with tho&s;e of Glendour, a Wel&s;h chieftain, who, &s;ome time before had been exchanged from pri&s;on, and had now advanced with his forces as far as Shrop&s;hire. Upon the junction of the&s;e two armies, they pub|li&s;hed a manife&s;to, which aggravated their real griev|ances, and invented more. In the mean time, Henry, who had recieved no intelligence of their de|&s;igns, was at fir&s;t greatly &s;urprized at the news of this rebellion. But fortune &s;eemed to befriend him on this occa&s;ion; he had a &s;mall army in readine&s;s, which he had intended again&s;t the Scotch, and knowing the importance of di&s;patch again&s;t &s;uch active ene|mies,
<PB N="103" REF="112">
he in&s;tantly hurried down to Shrew&s;bury, that he might give the rebels battle.</P>
<P>Upon the approach of the two armies, both &s;ides &s;eemed willing to give a colour to their cau&s;e, by &s;hewing a de&s;ire of reconciliation; but when they came to open their mutual demands, the treaty was turned into abu&s;e and recrimination. On one &s;ide was objected rebellion and ingratitude; on the other, tyranny and u&s;urpation. The two armies were pretty nearly equal, each con&s;i&s;ting of about twelve thou&s;and men; the animo&s;ity on both &s;ides was inflamed to the highe&s;t pitch; and no prudence nor military &s;kill could determine on which &s;ide the victory might incline. Accordingly, a very bloody engagement en&s;ued, in which the generals on both &s;ides exerted them&s;elves with great bravery. Henry was &s;een every where in the thicke&s;t of the fight; while his valiant &s;on, who was afterwards the re|nowned conqueror of France, fought by his &s;ide, and, though wounded in the face by an arrow, &s;till kept the field, and performed a&s;toni&s;hing acts of valour. On the other &s;ide, the daring Hot&s;pur &s;up|ported that renown which he had acquired in &s;o many bloody engagements, and every where &s;ought out the king as a noble object of his indignation. At la&s;t, however, his death, from an unknown hand, decided the victory; and the fortune of Henry once more prevailed. On that bloody day, it is &s;aid, that no le&s;s than two thou&s;and three hundred gentlemen were &s;lain, and about &s;ix thou&s;and private men, of whom two thirds were of Hot&s;pur's army.</P>
<P>While this furious tran&s;action was going forward, Northumberland, who was lately recovered from his indi&s;po&s;ition, was advancing with a body of troops to reinforce the army of the malecontents, and take upon him the command. But hearing by the way of his &s;on's and brother's misfortune, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his troops, not daring to keep the field with &s;o &s;mall a force,
<PB N="104" REF="113">
before an army &s;uperior in numberand &s;lu&s;hed with re|cent victory. The earl, therefore, for a while attempt|ed to find &s;afety by flight, but at la&s;t being pre&s;&s;ed by his pur&s;uers, and finding him&s;elf totally without re&s;ource, he cho&s;e rather to throw him&s;elf upon the king's mercy, than lead a precarious and indigent life in exile. Upon his appearing before Henry at York, he pretended that his &s;ole intention in arming was to mediate be|tween the two parties; and this, though but a very weak apology, &s;eemed to &s;atisfy the king. Nor|thumberland, therefore, received a pardon; Henry probably thinking that he was &s;ufficiently puni&s;hed by the lo&s;s of his army, and the death of his favour|ite &s;on.</P>
<P>By the&s;e means Henry &s;eemed to &s;urmount all his troubles; and the calm, which was thus produced, was employed by him in endeavours to acquire popularity, which he had lo&s;t by the &s;everities ex|erci&s;ed during the preceding part of his reign.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1407.</NOTE> For that rea&s;on, he often permit|ted the hou&s;e of commons to a&s;&s;ume pow|ers which had not been u&s;ually exerci&s;ed by their predece&s;&s;ors. In the &s;ixth year of his reign, when they voted him the &s;upplies, they ap|pointed trea&s;urers of their own, to &s;ee the money di&s;bur&s;ed for the purpo&s;es intended; and requred them to deliver in their accounts to the hou&s;e. They propo&s;ed thirty very important articles for the government of the king's hou&s;hold; and, on the whole pre&s;erved their priveleges and freedoms more entire during his reign than that of any of his pre|dece&s;&s;ors. But while the king thus laboured not without &s;ucce&s;s to retrieve the reputation he had lo&s;t, his &s;on Henry, prince of Wales, &s;eemed equally bent on incurring the public aver&s;ion. He became notorious for all kinds of debauchery; and ever cho&s;e to be &s;urrounded by a &s;et of wretches, who took pride in committing the mo&s;t illegal acts, with
<PB N="105" REF="114">
the prince at their head. The king was not a little mortified at this degeneracy in his elde&s;t &s;on, who &s;eemed entirely forgetful of his &s;tation, although he had already exhibited repeated proofs of his valour, conduct, and genero&s;ity. Such were the exce&s;&s;es into which he ran, that one of his di&s;&s;olute com|panions having been brought to trial befor Sir Willi|am Ga&s;coigne, chief ju&s;tice of the King's-bench, for &s;ome mi&s;demeanor, the prince was &s;o exa&s;perated at the i&s;&s;ue of the trial, that he &s;truck the judge in open court. The venerable magi&s;trate, who knew the reverence that was due to his &s;tation, behaved with a dignity that became his office, and immediately or|dered the prince to be committed to pri&s;on. When this tran&s;action was reported to the king, who was an excellent judge of mankind, he could not help exclaiming in a tran&s;port; "Happy is the king, that has a magi&s;trate endowed with courage to execute the laws upon &s;uch an offender; &s;till more happy in having a &s;on willing to &s;ubmit to &s;uch a cha&s;ti&s;e|ment!" This, in fact, is one of the fir&s;t great in|&s;tances we read in the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory of a magi&s;tate doing ju&s;tice in oppo&s;ition to power; &s;ince upon many former occa&s;ions, we find the judges only mini&s;ters of royal caprice.</P>
<P>Henry, who&s;e health had for &s;ome time been de|clining, did not long out-live this tran&s;action. He was &s;ubject to fits, which bereaved him, for the time, of his &s;en&s;es; and which at la&s;t brought on his death at We&s;tmin&s;ter, in the forty-&s;ixth year of his age, and the fourteenth of his reign.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. HENRY V.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1413.</NOTE>THE fir&s;t &s;teps taken by the young king confirmed all tho&s;e prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions en|tertained in his favour. He called together his former abandoned companions, acquainted them with his intended reformation; exhorted them to follow his example; and thus di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them from his pre&s;ence, allowing them a competency to &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon till he &s;aw them worthy of further promotion. The faith|ful mini&s;ters of his father, at fir&s;t, began to tremble for their former ju&s;tice, in the admini&s;tration of their duty; but he &s;oon ea&s;ed them of their fears, by taking them into his friend&s;hip and confidence. Sir William Ga&s;coigne, who thought him&s;elf the mo&s;t obnoxious, met with prai&s;es in&s;tead of reproaches, and was ex|horted to per&s;evere in the &s;ame rigorous and impar|tial execution of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>About this time the here&s;y of Wickli&s;&s;e, or Lol|lardi&s;m, as it was called, began to &s;pread every day more and more, while it received a new lu&s;tre from the protection and preaching of Sir John Old|ca&s;tle, baron of Cobham, who had been one of the king's dome&s;tics, and &s;tood high in his favour. The primate, however, indicted this nobleman, and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his &s;uffragans, condemned him as an heretic to be burnt alive. Cobham, however, e&s;cap|ing from the Tower, in which he was confined, the day before his execution, privately went among his party; and &s;timulating their zeal, led them up to London, to take a &s;ignal revenge on his enemies. But the king, appri&s;ed of his intentions, ordered that the city gates &s;hould be &s;hut; and coming by night with his guards into St. Giles's fields, &s;eized &s;uch of
<PB N="107" REF="116">
the con&s;pirators as appeared, and afterwards laid hold of &s;everal parties that were ha&s;tening to the appointed place. Some of the&s;e were executed, but the greater number pardoned. Cobham him&s;elf found means of e&s;caping for that time: but he was taken about four years after; and never did the cruelty of man in|vent, or crimes draw down, &s;uch torments as he was made to endure. He was hung up with a chain by by the middle,; and thus at a &s;low fire burned, or rather oa&s;ted, alive.</P>
<P>Henry, to turn the minds of the people from &s;uch hideous &s;cenes, re&s;olved to take the advantage of the troubles in which France was at that time engaged; and a&s;&s;embling a great fleet and army at Southampton landed at Harfleur, at the head of an army of &s;ix thou&s;and men at arms, and twenty-four thou&s;and foot, mo&s;tly archers.</P>
<P>But although the enemy made but a feeble re|&s;i&s;tance, yet the climate &s;eemed to fight again&s;t the Engli&s;h; a contagious dy&s;entery carrying off three parts of Henry's army. The Engli&s;h monarch, when it was too late, began to repent of his ra&s;h inroad into a country where di&s;ea&s;e and a powerful army, every where threatened de&s;truction; he therefore be|gan to think of retiring into Calais.</P>
<P>The enemy, however, re&s;olved to intercept his re|treat; and after he had pa&s;t the &s;mall river of Tertrois at Blangi, he was &s;urprized to ob&s;erve from the heights, the whole French army drawn up in the plains of Azincourt; and &s;o po&s;ted, that it was im|po&s;&s;ible for him to proceed on his march, without coming to an engagement. No &s;ituation could be more unfavourable than that in which he found him|&s;elf. His army was wa&s;ted with di&s;ea&s;e; the &s;oldiers &s;pirits worn down with fatigue, de&s;titute of provi|&s;ions, and di&s;couraged by their retreat. Their whole body amounted but to nine thou&s;and men; and the&s;e were to &s;u&s;tain the &s;hock of an enemy near ten times
<PB N="108" REF="117">
their number, headed by expert generals, and plen|tifully &s;upplied with provi&s;ions. As the enemy were &s;o much &s;uperior, he drew up his army on a narrow ground between two woods, which guarded each flank; and he patiently expected, in that po&s;ition, the attack of the enemy. The con&s;table of France was at the head of one army; and Henry him&s;elf, with Edward, duke of York, commanded the other. For a time both armies as if afraid to begin, kept &s;ilently gazing at each other, neither willing to break their ranks by making the on&s;et; which Henry perceiving, with a chearful countenance cried out, "My friends, &s;ince they will not begin, it is ours to &s;et them the example; come on, and the Ble&s;&s;ed Trinity be our protection." Upon this, the whole army &s;et forward with a &s;hout, while the French &s;till waited their approach with intrepidity. The Engli&s;h archers, who had long been famous for their great &s;kill, fir&s;t let fly a &s;hower of arrows three feet long, which did great execution. The French cavalry advancing to repel the&s;e, two hundered bowmen, who lay till then concealed, ri&s;ing on a &s;udden, let &s;ly among them, and produced &s;uch a confu&s;ion, that the archers threw by their arrows, and ru&s;hing in, fell upon them &s;word in hand. The French at fir&s;t repul&s;ed the a&s;&s;ailants, who were enfeebled by di&s;ea&s;e; but they &s;oon made up the defect by their valour; and re&s;olving to conquer or die, bur&s;t in upon the ene|my with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that the French were &s;oon obliged to give way.</P>
<P>They were overthrown in every part of the field; their numbers being crowded into a very narrow &s;pace, were incapable of either &s;lying, or making any re&s;i&s;tance; &s;o that they covered the ground with heaps of &s;lain. After all appearance of oppo&s;ition was over there was heard an alarm from behind, which proceeded from a number of pea&s;ants, who had fallen upon the Engli&s;h baggage, and were putting
<PB N="109" REF="118">
tho&s;e who guarded it to the &s;word. Henry, now &s;ee|ing the enemy on all &s;ides of him, began to entertain apprehen&s;ions from his pri&s;oners, the number of whom exceeded even that of his army. He thought it nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, to i&s;&s;ue general orders for put|ing them to death; but on the di&s;covery of the cer|tainty of his victory he &s;topped the &s;laughter, and was &s;till able to &s;ave a great a number. This &s;e|verity tarni&s;hed the glory which his victory would otherwi&s;e have acquired; but all the heroi&s;m of that age is tinctured with barbarity. In this battle the French lo&s;t ten thou&s;and men, and fourteen thou|&s;and pri&s;oners; the Engli&s;h only forty men in all.</P>
<P>France was at that time in a wretched &s;i|tuation;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1417.</NOTE> the whole kingdom appeared as one va&s;t theatre of crimes, murders, inju&s;tice, and deva&s;tation. The duke of Orleans was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nated by the duke of Burgundy; and the duke of Bur|gundy, in his turn, fell by the treachery of the dauphin.</P>
<P>A &s;tate of imbecility into which Charles had fallen, made him pa&s;&s;ive in every tran&s;action; and Henry, at la&s;t, by conque&s;t and negociation, cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be elected heir to the crown. The principal ar|ticles of this treaty were, that Henry &s;hould e&s;pou&s;e the prince&s;s Catharine, daughter to the king of France, that king Charles &s;hould enjoy the title and dignity for life; but that Henry &s;hould be declared heir to the crown, and &s;hould be entru&s;ted with the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration of the government; that France and England &s;hould for ever be united under one king, but &s;hould &s;till retain their re&s;pective laws and privileges.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this while Henry was every, where victorious, he fixed his re&s;idence at Paris;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1421.</NOTE> and while Charles had but a &s;mall court, he was attended with a very magnifi|cent one. On Whit-&s;unday the two kings and their two queens with crowns on their heads, dined
<PB N="110" REF="119">
together in public; Charles receiving apparent ho|mage, but Henry commanding with ab&s;olute authority.</P>
<P>Henry at a time when his glory had nearly reached its &s;ummit, and both crowns were ju&s;t devolved upon him, was &s;eized with a fi&s;tula; a di&s;order, which from the un&s;kilfulne&s;s of the phy&s;icians of the times, &s;oon became mortal. He expired with the &s;ame in|trepidity with which he had lived, in the thirty-fourth year of his age, and the tenth year of his reign.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. HENRY VI.</HEAD>
<P>THE duke of Bedford, one of the mo&s;t ac|compli&s;hed princes of the age,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1422.</NOTE> and equally experienced, both in the cabinet and the field, was appointed by parliament protec|tor of England, defender of the church, and fir&s;t coun|&s;ellor to the king, during his minority, as he was not yet a year old; and as France was the great object that engro&s;&s;ed all con&s;ideration, he attempted to exert the ef|forts of the nation upon the continent with all his vigour.</P>
<P>A new revolution was produced in that kingdom, by means apparently the mo&s;t unlikely to be attended with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>In the village of Domreni, near Vaucouleurs, on the borders of Lorrain, there lived a country girl, about twenty-&s;even years of age, called Joan of Arc. This girl had been a &s;ervant at a &s;mall inn; and in that humble &s;tation had &s;ubmitted to tho&s;e hardy em|ployments which fit the body for the fatigues of war. She was of an irreproachable life, and had hi|therto te&s;tified none of tho&s;e enterprizing qualities which di&s;played them&s;elves &s;oon after. Her mind, however, brooding with melancholy &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s upon the mi&s;erable &s;ituation of her country, began to feel
<PB N="111" REF="120">
&s;everal impul&s;es, which &s;he was willing to mi&s;take for the in&s;pirations of heaven. Convinced of the reality of her own admonitions, &s;he had recour&s;e to one Baudricourt, governor of Vaucouleurs, and in|formed him of her de&s;tination by heaven, to free her native country from its fierce invaders. Baudricourt treated her at fir&s;t with &s;ome neglect; but her im|portunities at length prevailed; and, willing to make a trial of her preten&s;ions, he gave her &s;ome at|tendants, who conducted her to the French court, which at that time re&s;ided at Chinon.</P>
<P>The French court were probably &s;en&s;ible of the weakne&s;s of her preten&s;ions; but they were willing to make u&s;e of every artifice to &s;upport their declining fortunes. It was therefore given out, that Joan was actually in&s;pired; that &s;he was able to di&s;cover the king among the number of his courtiers, although he had laid a&s;ide all the di&s;tinctions of his authority; that &s;he had told him &s;ome &s;ecrets, which were only known to him&s;elf; and that &s;he had demanded, and minutely de&s;cribed, a &s;word in the church of St. Catharine de Fierbois, which &s;he had never &s;een. In this manner the minds of the vulgar being pre|pared for her appearance, &s;he was armed cap-&agrave;-pee, mounted on a charger, and &s;hewn in that martial dre&s;s to the people. She was then brought before the doctors of the univer&s;ity; and they tinctured with the credulity of the times, or willing to &s;econd the impo&s;ture, declared that &s;he had actually received her commi&s;&s;ion from above.</P>
<P>When the preparations for her mi&s;&s;ion were com|completely blazoned, their next aim was to &s;end her again&s;t the enemy. The Engli&s;h were at that time be&s;ieging the city of Orleans, the la&s;t re&s;ource of Charles, and every thing promi&s;ed them a &s;peedy &s;ur|render. Joan undertook to rai&s;e the &s;iege; and to render her&s;elf &s;till more remarkable, girded her&s;elf with the miraculous &s;word, of which &s;he had before
<PB N="112" REF="121">
&s;uch extraordinary notices. Thus equipped, &s;he or|dered all the &s;oldiers to confe&s;s them&s;elves before they &s;et out, &s;he di&s;played in her hand a con&s;ecrated banner, and a&s;&s;ured the troops of certain &s;ucce&s;s. Such confidence on her &s;ide &s;oon rai&s;ed the &s;pirits of the French army; and even the Engli&s;h, who pre|tended to de&s;pi&s;e her efforts, felt them&s;elves &s;ecretly influenced with the terrors of her mi&s;&s;ion, and relax|ing in their endeavours, the &s;iege was rai&s;ed with great precipitation.</P>
<P>From being attacked, the French now in turn became the agre&s;&s;ors. One victory followed another, and at length the French king was &s;olemnly crowned at Rheims, which was what Joan had promi&s;ed &s;hould come to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>A tide of &s;ucce&s;&s;es followed the performance of this &s;olemnity; but Joan having thrown her&s;elf into the city of Compeign with a body of troops that was then be&s;ieging by the duke of Burgundy, &s;he was taken pri&s;oner in a &s;ally which &s;he headed again&s;t the enemy, the governor &s;hutting the gates behind.</P>
<P>The duke of Bedford was no &s;ooner informed of her being taken, than he purcha&s;ed her of the count Vendome, who had made her his pri&s;oner, and or|dered her to be committed to clo&s;e confinement. The credulity of both nations was at that time &s;o great, that nothing was too ab&s;urd to gain belief that coincided with their pa&s;&s;ions. As Joan but a little before, from her &s;ucce&s;&s;es, was regarded as a &s;aint, &s;he was now, upon her captivity, con&s;idered as a &s;orcere&s;s, for&s;aken by the daemon who had granted her a fallacious and temporary a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and ac|cordingly being tried at Rouen, &s;he was found guilty of here&s;y and witchcraft, and &s;entenced to be burnt alive, which was executed accordingly with the mo&s;t ignorant malignity.</P>
<P>From this period the Engli&s;h affairs became totally irretrievable. The city of Paris returned once more
<PB N="113" REF="122">
to a &s;en&s;e of its duty. Thus ground was continu|ally, though &s;lowly, gained by the French.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1443.</NOTE></P>
<P>And in the lap&s;e of a few years Calais alone remained of all the conque&s;ts that had been made in France, and this was but a &s;mall compen&s;ation for the blood and trea&s;ure which had been lavi&s;hed in that country, and which only &s;erv|ed to gratify ambition with tran&s;ient applau&s;e.</P>
<P>But the incapacity of Henry began to appear in a fuller light; and foreign war being now extin|gui&s;hed, the people began to prepare for the horrors of inte&s;tine &s;trife. In this period of calamity, a new intere&s;t was revived, which had lain dormant in the times of pro&s;perity and triumph. Richard duke of York, who was de&s;cended, by the mother's &s;ide, from Lionel, one of the &s;ons of Edward the Third, whereas the reigning king was de&s;cended from John of Gaunt, a younger &s;on of the &s;ame monarch; Richard, therefore, &s;tood plainly in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion before Henry; and he began to think the weakne&s;s and unpopulari|ty of the pre&s;ent reign a favourable moment for ambi|tion. The en&s;ign of Richard was a white ro&s;e, that of Henry a red; and this gave name to the two factions, who&s;e animo&s;ity was now about to drench the kingdom with &s;laughter.</P>
<P>Among the number of complaints which the unpopularity of the government gave ri&s;e to, there were &s;ome which even excited in&s;urrection; parti|cularly that headed by John Cade, which was of the mo&s;t dangerous nature. This man was a native of Ireland, who had been obliged to fly over into France for his crimes; but &s;eeing the people upon his re|turn prepared for violent mea&s;ures, he a&s;&s;umed the name of Mortimer; and at the head of twenty thou&s;and Kenti&s;h men advanced towards the capital, and encamped at Blackheath. The king being in|formed

of this commotion, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to demand the cau&s;e of their a&s;&s;embling in arms; and Cade, in the name of the community, an&s;wered that their on|ly aim was to puni&s;h evil mini&s;ters, and procure a redre&s;s of grievances for the people. But com|mitting &s;ome abu&s;es, and engaging with the citizens, he was abandoned by mo&s;t of his followers, and, re|treating to Roche&s;ter, was obliged to fly alone into the Wolds of Kent, where a price being &s;et upon his head by proclamation, he was di&s;covered and &s;lain.</P>
<P>In the mean time the duke of York &s;ecretly fo|mented the&s;e di&s;turbances, and pretending to e&s;|pou&s;e the cau&s;e of the people, &s;till &s;ecretly a&s;pired at the crown, and though he wi&s;hed nothing &s;o ardent|ly, yet he was for &s;ome time prevented by his own &s;cruples from &s;eizing it. What his intrigues failed to bring about, accident produced to his de&s;ire. The king falling into a di&s;temper, which &s;o far encrea&s;ed his natural embecility that it even rendered him incapable of maintaining the appearance of royalty, York was appointed lieutenant and protector of the kingdom, with powers to hold and open parliaments at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Being thus inve&s;ted with a plenitude of pow|er,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1454.</NOTE> he continued in the enjoyment of it for &s;ome time; but at length the unhappy king recover|ing from his lethargic complaint, and, as if awaking from a dream, perceived with &s;urprize, that he was &s;tripped of all his authority. Henry was married to Margaret of Anjou, a woman of a ma&s;culine under|&s;tanding, who obliged him to take the field; and in a manner dragged him to it, where both &s;ides came to an engagement, in which the Yorki&s;ts gained a com|plete victory. The king him&s;elf being wounded, and taking &s;helter in a cottage, near the field of battle, was taken pri&s;oner, and treated by the victor with great re&s;pect and tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="124">Henry was now but a pri&s;oner treated with the &s;plendid forms of royalty; yet indolent and &s;ickly, he &s;eemed plea&s;ed with his &s;ituation, and did not re|gret that power which was not to be exerci&s;ed with|out fatigue. But Margaret once more induced him to a&s;&s;ert his prerogative. The contending parties met at Bloreheath,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 23. 1459.</NOTE> on the borders of Stafford&s;hire, and the Yorki&s;ts gained &s;ome advantages; but Sir Andrew Trollop, who commanded a body of veterans for the duke of York, de&s;erted wth all his men to the king; and this &s;o inti|midated the whole army of the Yorki&s;ts, that they &s;e|parated the next day without &s;triking a &s;ingle blow. Se|veral other engagements followed with various &s;uc|ce&s;s. Margaret being at one time victorious, at another an exile, the victory upon Wakefield-Green, in which the duke of York was &s;lain, &s;eemed to fix her good for|tune.</P>
<P>But the earl of Warwck, who now put him&s;elf at the head of the Yorki&s;ts, was one of the mo&s;t cele|brated generals of his age, formed for times of trou|ble, extremely artful and inconte&s;tibly brave, equal|ly &s;kilful in council and the field, and in&s;pired with a degree of hatred again&s;t the queen that nothing could &s;uppre&s;s. He commanded an army, in which he led about the captive king to give a &s;anction to his attempts. Upon the approach of the Lanca&s;trians he conducted his forces, &s;trengthened by a body of Londoners, who were very affectionate to his cau&s;e, and he gave battle to the queen at St. Alban's. In this however he was defeated. Above two thou&s;and of the Yorki&s;ts peri&s;hed in the battle, and the per&s;on of the king again fell into the hands of his own party; to be treated with apparent re&s;pect, but real contempt.</P>
<P>In the mean time, young Edward, the elde&s;t &s;on of the late duke of York, began to repair the lo&s;&s;es his party had lately &s;u&s;tained, and to give &s;pirit to the Yorki&s;ts. This prince, in the bloom of youth,
<PB N="116" REF="125">
remarkable for the beauty of his per&s;on, his bravery, and popular deportment, advanced towards London with the remainder of Warwick's army; and oblig|ing Margaret to retire, entered the city amid&s;t the acclamations of the people. Perceiving his own popularity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1461.</NOTE> he &s;uppo&s;ed that now was the time to lay his claim to the crown; and his friend Warwick, a&s;&s;embling the citizens in St. John's fields, pronounced an harangue, &s;etting forth the title of Edward, and inveighing again&s;t the tyranny and u&s;urpation of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter. Both &s;ides at length met near Touton, in the county of York, to decide the fate of empire, and never was England de|populated by &s;o terrible an engagement. It was a dreadful &s;ight to behold an hundred thou&s;and men of the &s;ame country engaged agai&s;t each other; and all to &s;atis|fy the empty ambition of the weake&s;t, or the wor&s;t of mankind. While the army of Edward was advanc|ing to the charge, there happened a great fall of &s;now; which driving full in the faces of the ene|my, blinded them, and this advantage, &s;econded by an impetuous on&s;et, decided the victory in their favour. Edward i&s;&s;ued orders to give no quar|ter; and a bloody &s;laughter en&s;ued, in which near forty thou&s;and of the Lanca&s;trians were &s;lain.</P>
<P>The weak unfortunate Henry, always imprudent, and always un&s;ucce&s;sful, was taken pri&s;oner, carried to London with ignominy, and confined in the Tower. Margaret was rather more fortunate; &s;he contrived to e&s;cape out of the kingdom, and took refuge with her father in Flanders.</P>
<P>Edward being now, by means of the earl of War|wick, fixed upon the throne, reigned in peace and &s;e|curity, while his title was recognized, by par|liament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1464.</NOTE> and univer&s;ally &s;ubmitted to by the people. He began, therefore, to give a loo&s;e to his favourite pa&s;&s;ions; and a &s;pirit of gal|lantry, mixed with cruelty, was &s;een to prevail in his
<PB N="117" REF="126">
court. In the very &s;ame palace, which one day ex|hibitted a &s;pectacle of horror, was to be &s;een the day following a ma&s;k or a pageant; and the king would at once gallant a mi&s;tre&s;s, and in&s;pect an execution. In order to turn him from the&s;e pur&s;uits, which were cal|culated to render him unpopular, the earl of War|wick advi&s;ed him to marry; and, with his con&s;ent, went over to France to procure Bona of Savoy as queen, and the match was accordingly concluded. But whil&s;t the earl was ha&s;tening the negotiation in France, the king him&s;elf rendered it abortive at home, by marrying Elizabeth Woodville, with whom he had fallen in love, and whom he had vainly endeavoured to debauch. Having thus given Warwick real cau&s;e of offence, he was re&s;olved to widen the breach, by driving him from the council. Warwick, who&s;e prudence was equal to his bravery, &s;oon made u&s;e of both to a&s;&s;i&s;t his revenge; and formed &s;uch a combi|nation again&s;t Edward that he was, in turn, obliged to fly the kingdom.</P>
<P>Thus, once more the poor pa&s;&s;ive king Henry was relea&s;ed from pri&s;on to be placed upon a dange|rous throne. A parliament was called, which con|firmed Henry's title with great &s;olemnity; and War|wick was him&s;elf received among the people under the title of the King-maker.</P>
<P>But Edward's party, though repre&s;&s;ed, was not de&s;|troyed. Though an exile in Holland, he had many partizans at home; and after an ab&s;ence of nine months, being &s;econded by a &s;mall body of forces, granted him by the duke of Burgundy, he made a de&s;cent at Raven&s;pur in York&s;hire. Though, at fir&s;t, he was coolly received by the Engli&s;h, yet his army encrea&s;ed upon his march, while his moderation and feigned humility &s;till added to the number of his partizans. London, at that time, ever ready to ad|mit the mo&s;t powerful, opened her gates to him; and the wretched Henry was once more plucked from
<PB N="118" REF="127">
his throne, to be &s;ent back to his former man|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Nothing now, therefore, remained to Warwick, but to cut &s;hort a &s;tate of anxious &s;u&s;pen&s;e by hazarding a battle. Edward's fortune prevailed. They met at St. Albans, and the Lanca&s;trians were defeated, while Warwick him&s;elf, leading a cho&s;en body of troops into the thicke&s;t of the &s;laughter, fell in the mid&s;t of his enemies, covered with wounds.</P>
<P>Margaret, receiving the fatal news of the death of the brave Warwick, and the total de&s;truction of her party, gave way to her grief, for the fir&s;t time, in a torrent of tears; and yielding to her unhappy fate, took &s;anctuary in the abbey of Beaulieu, in Hamp&s;hire.</P>
<P>She had not been long in this melancholy abode before &s;he found &s;ome few friends &s;till willing to a&s;&s;i&s;t her fallen fortunes. Tudor, earl of Pembroke, Courtney, earl of Devon&s;hire, the lords Wenlock, and St. John, with other men of rank, exhorted her &s;till to hope for &s;ucce&s;s, and offered to a&s;&s;i&s;t her to the la&s;t. She had now fought battles in almo&s;t every province in England; Tewke&s;bury-park was the la&s;t &s;cene that terminated her attempts. The duke of Somer&s;et headed her army; a man who had &s;hared her dangers, and had ever been &s;teady in her cau&s;e. He was valiant, generous, and polite; but ra&s;h and head&s;trong. When Edward fir&s;t attacked him in his intrenchments, he repul&s;ed him with &s;uch vigour, that the enemy retired with precipitation; upon which the duke, &s;uppo&s;ing them routed, pur&s;u|ed, and ordered lord Wenlock to &s;upport his charge. But unfortunately this lord di&s;obeyed his orders; and Somer&s;et's forces were &s;oon overpowered by num|bers. In this dreadful exigence, the duke, finding that all was over, became ungovernable in his rage; and beholding Wenlock inactive, and remaining in the very place where he had fir&s;t drawn up his men
<PB N="119" REF="128">
giving way to his fury, with his heavy battle-ax in both hands, he ran upon the coward, and with one blow da&s;hed out his brains.</P>
<P>The queen and the prince were taken pri&s;oners af|ter the battle, and brought into the pre&s;ence of Ed|ward. The young prince appeared before the con|queror with undaunted maje&s;ty; and being a&s;ked, in an in&s;ulting manner, how he dared to invade Eng|land without leave, the young prince, more mindful of his high birth than of his ruined fortune, re|plied, "I have entered the dominions of my father, to revenge his injuries, and redre&s;s my own." The barbarous Edward, enraged at his intrepidity, &s;truck him on the mouth with his gauntlet; and this &s;erved as a &s;ignal for further brutality: the dukes of Glou|ce&s;ter, Clarence, and others, like wild bea&s;ts, ru&s;h|ing on the unarmed youth at once, &s;tabbed him to the heart with their daggers. To complete the tragedy, Henry him&s;elf, who had long been the pa&s;&s;ive &s;pec|tator of all the&s;e horrors, was now thought unfit to live. The duke of Glouce&s;ter, afterwards Richard the Third, entering his chamber-alone, murdered him in cold blood. Of all tho&s;e that were taken, none were &s;uffered to &s;urvive but Margaret her&s;elf. It was perhaps expected that &s;he would be ran&s;omed by the king of France; and in this they were not deceived, as that monarch paid the king of England fifty thou|&s;and crowns for her freedom. This extraordinary woman, after having &s;u&s;tained the cau&s;e of her hu&s;|band in twelve battles, after having &s;urvived her friends, fortunes, and children, died a few years after in privacy in France, very mi&s;erable indeed; but with few other claims to our pity, except her courage and her di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. EDWARD IV.</HEAD>
<P>EDWARD being now freed from great enemies, turned the puni&s;hment to tho&s;e of le&s;&s;er note; &s;o that the gibbets were hung with his adver&s;aries, and their e&s;tates confi&s;cated to his u&s;e.</P>
<P>While he was thus rendering him&s;elf terrible on the one hand, he was immer&s;ed in abandoned plea&s;ures on the other. Nature, it &s;eems, was not unfavourable to him in that re&s;pect; as he was uni|ver&s;ally allowed to be the mo&s;t beautiful man of his time. His courtiers al&s;o &s;eemed willing to encou|rage tho&s;e debaucheries in which they had a &s;hare; and the clergy, as they them&s;elves practi&s;ed every kind of lewdne&s;s with impunity, were ever ready to lend ab&s;olution to all his failings. The truth is, enormous vices had been of late &s;o common, that adultery was held but as a very &s;light offence. Among the number of his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es was the wife of one Shore, a merchant in the city, a woman of exqui|&s;ite beauty and good &s;en&s;e, but who had not virtue enough to re&s;i&s;t the temptations of a beautiful man, and a monarch.</P>
<P>Among his other cruelties, that to his brother the duke of Clarence is the mo&s;t remarkable. The king hunting one day in the park of Thomas Burdet, a creature of the duke's killed a white buck, which was a great favourite of the owner. Burdet, vexed at the lo&s;s, broke into a pa&s;&s;ion, and wi&s;hed the horns of the deer in the belly of the per&s;on who bad ad|vi&s;ed the king to that in&s;ult. For this trifling excla|mation Burdet was tried for his life, and publickly executed at Tyburn. The duke of Clarence, upon the death of his friend, vented his grief in renewed
<PB N="121" REF="130">
reproaches again&s;t his brother, and exclaimed again&s;t the iniquity of the &s;entence. The king highly offend|ed with this liberty, or u&s;ing that as a pretext again&s;t him, had him arraigned before the hou&s;e of peers, and appeared in per&s;on as his accu&s;er. In tho&s;e times of confu&s;ion, every crime alledged by the pre|vailing party was fatal; the duke was found guilty; and being granted a choice of the manner in which he would die, he was privately drowned in a butt of malm&s;ey in the tower; a whim&s;ical choice, and im|plying that he had an extraordinary pa&s;&s;ion for that liquor.</P>
<P>However, if this monarch's reign was tyrannical, it was but &s;hort; while he was employed in making preparations for a war with France, he was &s;eized with a di&s;temper, of which he expired in the forty-&s;econd year of his age, and (counting from the death of the late king) in the twenty-third of his reign.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX. EDWARD V.</HEAD>
<P>THE duke of Glouce&s;ter, who had been made protector of the realm, upon a pretence of guard|ing the per&s;ons of the late king's children from dan|ger, conveyed them both to the Tower.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;ecured them, his next &s;tep was to &s;pread a report of their illegitimacy; and by pretend|ed ob&s;tacles, to put off the day appointed for young Edward's coronation. His next aim was to di&s;patch lord Ha&s;tings, whom he knew to be warmly in the young king's intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Having &s;ummoned lord Ha&s;tings to a council in the Tower, he entered the room knitting his brows, biting his lips, and &s;hewing, by a frequent change of countenance, the &s;igns of &s;ome inward perturba|tion.
<PB N="122" REF="131">
A &s;ilence en&s;ued for &s;ome time; and the the lords of the council looked upon each other, not without rea&s;on, expecting &s;ome horrid cata&s;trophe. Laying bare his arm all &s;hrivelled and decayed, he accu&s;ed Jane Shore and her accomplices of having produced this deformity by their &s;orcere&s;s, upon which Ha&s;tings cried, "If they have committed &s;uch a crime, they de&s;erve puni&s;hment." "If! cried the protector, with a loud voice, do&s;t thou an|&s;wer me with I&s;s? I tell thee that they have con&s;pired my death; and that thou, traitor, art an accomplice in the crime." He then &s;truck the table twice with his hand; and the room was in&s;tantly filled with armed men. "I arre&s;t thee, continues he, turning to Ha&s;tings, for high trea&s;on; and at the &s;ame time gave him in charge to the &s;oldiers. Ha&s;tings was obliged to make a &s;hort confe&s;&s;ion to the next prie&s;t that was at hand; the protector crying out, By St. Paul, that he would not dine till he had &s;een his head taken off. He was accordingly hurried out to the Little Green before the Tower-chapel, and there be|headed on a log of wood, that accidentally lay in the way.</P>
<P>Jane Shore, the late king's mi&s;tre&s;s, was the next that felt his indignation. This unfortunate woman was an enemy too humble to excite his jealou&s;y; yet as he had accu&s;ed her of witchcraft, of which all the world &s;aw &s;he was innocent, he thought proper to make her an example, for tho&s;e faults of which &s;he was really guilty. Jane Shore had been formerly deluded from her hu&s;band, who was a gold&s;mith in Lombard Street, and continued to live with Edward, the mo&s;t guiltle&s;s mi&s;tre&s;s in his abandoned court. It was very probable, that the people were not di&s;|plea&s;ed at &s;eeing one again reduced to former mean|e&s;s, who had for a while been rai&s;ed above them, and enjoyed the &s;miles of a court. The charge again&s;t her was too notorious to be denied; &s;he plead|ed
<PB N="123" REF="132">
guilty, and was accordingly condemned to walk bare-foot through the city, and to do penance in St. Paul's church in a white &s;heet, with wax-taper in her hand, before thou&s;ands of &s;pectators. She lived above forty years after this &s;entence, and was reduced to the mo&s;t extreme indigence</P>
<P>The protector now began to throw off the ma&s;k, and to deny his pretended regard for the &s;ons of the late king, thinking it high time to a&s;pire at the throne more openly. He had previou&s;ly gained over the duke of Buckingham, a man of talents and power, by bribes and promi&s;es of future favour. This no|bleman therefore u&s;ed all his arts to cajole the po|pulace and citizens at St. Paul's cro&s;s, and con&s;tru|ing their &s;ilence, into con&s;ent, his followers cried, "Long live king Richard." Soon after the mayor and aldermen, waiting upon Richard with an offer of the crown, he accepted it with &s;eeming reluct|ance.</P>

As &s;oon, herefore, as Richard was &s;eated upon the throne, he &s;ent the governor of the Tower orders to put the two young princes to death; but this brave man, who&s;e name was Brackenbury, re|fu&s;ed to be made the in&s;trument of a tyrant's will; and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively an&s;wered, that he knew not how to embrue his hands in innocent blood. A &s;it in&s;tru|ment, however, was not long wanting; Sir James Tyrrel readily undertook the office, and Brackenbu|ry was ordered to re&s;ign to him the keys for one night. Tyrrel chu&s;ing three a&s;&s;ociates, Slater, Deighton,
<PB N="124" REF="133">
and Fore&s;t, came in the night-time to the door of the chamber where the princes were lodged, and &s;ending in the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, he bid them execute their com|mi&s;&s;ion, while he him&s;elf &s;taid without. They found the young princes in bed, and fallen into a &s;ound &s;leep: after &s;uffocating them with the bol&s;ter and pillows, they &s;hewed their naked bodies to Tyrrel, who ordered them to be buried at the &s;tair-foot, deep in the ground, under an heap of &s;tones.</P>
<P>But while he thus endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h his pow|er, he found it threatened on a quarter where he lea&s;t expected an attack. The duke of Buckingham, who had been in&s;trumental in placing him on the throne, now took di&s;gu&s;t at being refu&s;ed &s;ome confi&s;cated lands for which he &s;olicited. He therefore levied a body of men in Wales, and advanced by ha&s;ty marches towards Glouce&s;ter, where he de&s;igned to cro&s;s the Severn. Ju&s;t at that time the river was &s;woln to &s;uch a degree, that the country on both &s;ides was deluged, and even the tops of &s;ome hills were covered with water. This inundation continued for ten days; during which Buckingham's army, compo&s;ed of Wel&s;hmen, could neither pa&s;s the river, nor find &s;ub&s;i&s;tence on their own &s;ide; they were therefore obliged to di&s;per&s;e and return home, notwith&s;tand|ing all the duke's efforts to prolong their &s;tay. In this helple&s;s &s;ituation, the duke, after a &s;hort delibe|ration, took refuge at the hou&s;e of one Bani&s;ter, who had been his &s;ervant, and who had received repeated obligations from his family; but the wicked &s;eldom find, as they &s;eldom exert, friend|&s;hip. Bani&s;ter, unable to re&s;i&s;t the temptation of a large reward that was &s;et upon the duke's head, went and betrayed him to the &s;heriff of Shrop&s;hire; who, &s;urrounding the hou&s;e with armed men, &s;eized the duke, in the habit of a pea&s;ant, and conducted him to Sali&s;bury; where he was in&s;tantly tried, con|demned, and executed, according to the &s;ummary method practi&s;ed in tho&s;e ages.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="134">Amid&s;t the perplexity cau&s;ed by many di&s;|agreeable occurrences, he received information, that the earl of Richmond was making, preparations to land in England, and a&s;&s;ert his claims to the crown. Richard, who knew not in what quarter he might expect the invader, had taken po&s;t at Nottingham, in the centre of the kingdom; and had given com|mi&s;&s;ions to &s;everal of his creatures, to oppo&s;e the ene|my wherever he &s;hould land.</P>
<P>Some time after, however, the earl of Rich|mond, who was a de&s;cendant from John of Gaunt, by the female line, re&s;olved to &s;trike for the crown. He had been long obnoxious to the hou&s;e of York, and had been obliged to quit the kingdom; but he now knowing how odious the king was, &s;et out from Harfleur in Normandy, with a retinue of about two thou&s;and per&s;ons; and after a voyage of &s;ix days arriv|ed at Milford-Haven, in Wales, where he landed without oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Upon news of this de&s;cent, Richard who was po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of courage and military conduct, his only virtues, in&s;tantly re&s;olved to meet his antagoni&s;t, and decide their mutual preten&s;ions by a battle. Richmond, on the other hand, being reinforced by Sir Thomas Bourchier, Sir Walter Hungerford, and others to the number of about &s;ix thou&s;and, boldly advanced with the &s;ame intention; and in a few days both armies drew near Bo&s;worth-field, where the con|te&s;t that had now for more than forty years filled the kingdom with civil commotions and deluged its plains with blood, was determined by the death of Richard, who was &s;lain in battle, while Richmond was &s;aluted king by the title of Henry the Seventh.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXII. HENRY VII.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1485.</NOTE>HENRY's fir&s;t care upon coming to the throne was to marry the prince&s;s Elizabeth, daughter of Edward the Fourth; and thus he blended the intere&s;ts of the hou&s;es of York and Lanca&s;ter, &s;o that ever after they werein capable of di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>A great part of the mi&s;eries of his predece&s;&s;ors pro|ceeded from their poverty, which was mo&s;tly occa&s;i|oned by riot and di&s;&s;ipation. Henry &s;aw that money alone could turn the &s;cale of power in his favour; and therefore hoarded up all the confi&s;cations of his enemies with the utmo&s;t frugality.</P>
<P>Immediately after his marriage with Elizabeth, he i&s;&s;ued a general pardon to all &s;uch as cho&s;e to accept it; but people were become &s;o turbulent and factious by a long cour&s;e of civil war, that no governor could rule them, nor any king plea&s;e; &s;o that one rebellion &s;eemed extingui&s;hed only to give ri&s;e to another.</P>
<P>There lived in Oxford one Richard Simon, a prie&s;t, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;ome &s;ubtlety and more ra&s;hne&s;s, train|ed up Lambert Simnel, a baker's &s;on, to coun|terfeit the per&s;on of the earl of Warwick, the &s;on of the duke of Clarence, who was &s;mothered in a butt of malm&s;ey.

<P>In this manner king Simnel, being joined by lord Lovel, and one or two lords more of the di&s;con|tented party, re&s;olved to pa&s;s over into England; and accordingly landed in Lanca&s;hire, from whence he marched to York, expecting the countrwould ri&s;e

But in this he was deceived; the people aver&s;e to join a body of German and Iri&s;h troops, by whom he was &s;upported, and kept in awe by the king's reputation, remained in tranquility, or gave all their a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the royal cau&s;e. The earl of Lincoln, therefore, a di&s;affected lord, to whom the command of the rebel army was given, finding no hopes but in &s;peedy victory, was determined to bring the conte&s;t to a &s;hort i&s;&s;ue. The oppo&s;ite armies met at Stoke, in the county of Not|tingham, and &s;ought a battle, which was more bloody, and more ob&s;tinately di&s;puted, than could have been expected from the inequality of their forces. But victory at length declared in favour of the king, and it proved deci&s;ive. Lord Lincoln peri&s;hed in the field of battle; lord Lovel was never more heard of, and it was &s;uppo&s;ed he &s;hared the &s;ame &s;ate. Sim|nel, with his tutor Simon, were taken pri&s;oners; and four thou&s;and of the common men fell in battle. Si|mon being a prie&s;t could not be tried by the civil power, and was only committed to clo&s;e confinement. Simnel was too contemptible to excite the king's fears or re&s;entment; he was pardoned, and made a &s;cullion in the king's kitchen, whence he was afterwards ad|vanced to the rank of falconer, in which mean em|ployment he died.</P>
<P>A fre&s;h in&s;urrection began in York&s;hire, the peo|ple re&s;i&s;ting the commi&s;&s;ioners who were appointed to levy the tax. The earl of Northumberland attempt|ed to enforce the king's command; but the populace, being by this taught to believe that he was the advi&s;er of their oppre&s;&s;ions, flew to arms, attacked his hou&s;e, and put him to death. The mutineers did not &s;top there; but, by the advice of one John Achamber, a &s;editious fellow of mean birth, they cho&s;e Sir John Egremont for their leader, and prepared them&s;elves for a vigorous re&s;i&s;tance. The king, upon hearing
<PB N="128" REF="137">
this ra&s;h proceeding, immediately levied a force which he put under the earl of Surry; and this no|bleman encountering the rebels, di&s;&s;ipated the tu|mult, and took their leader, Achamber, pri&s;oner. A chamber was &s;hortly after executed; but Sir John Egremont fled to the court of the dutche&s;s of Bur|gundy, the u&s;ual retreat of all who were obnoxious to government in England.</P>
<P>One would have imagined, that from the ill &s;ucce&s;s of Simnel's impo&s;ture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1492.</NOTE> few would be willing to embark in another of a &s;imi|lar kind; however, the old dutche&s;s of Bur|gundy, rather irritated than di&s;couraged by the fai|lure of her pa&s;t enterprizes, was determined to di&s;turb that government, which &s;he could not &s;ubvert. She fir&s;t procured a report to be &s;pread, that the young duke of York, &s;aid to have been murdered in the Tower, was &s;till living; and finding the rumour greedily received, &s;he &s;oon produced a young man who a&s;&s;umed his name and character. The per&s;on pitched upon to &s;u&s;tain this part was one O&s;beck or Warbeck, the &s;on of a converted Jew, who had been over in England during the reign of Edward IV. where he had this &s;on named Peter, but corrupted after the Flemi&s;h manner, into Peterkin or Perkin. The duche&s;s of Burgundy found this youth entirely &s;uited to her purpo&s;es; and her le&s;&s;ons, in|&s;tructing him to per&s;onate the duke of York, were ea&s;ily learned and &s;trongly retained by a youth of very quick apprehen&s;ion. In &s;hort, his graceful air, his courtly addre&s;s, his ea&s;y manners, and elegant conver&s;ation, were capable of impo&s;ing upon all but &s;uch as were con&s;cious of the impo&s;ture.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h, ever ready to revolt, gave credit to all the&s;e ab&s;urdities; while the young man's pru|dence, conver&s;ation, and deportment, &s;erved to con|firm what their di&s;affection and credulity had be|gun.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="138">Among tho&s;e who &s;ecretly abetted the cau&s;e of Per|kin, were lord Fitzwater, Sir Simon Mountford, Sir Thomas Thwaits, and Sir Robert Clifford. But the per&s;on of the greate&s;t weight, and the mo&s;t dan|gerous oppo&s;ition, was Sir William Stanley, the lord Chamberlain, and brother to the famous lord Stanley, who had contributed to place Henry on the throne. This per&s;onage, either moved by a blind credulity, or more probably by a re&s;tle&s;s ambition, entered into a regular con&s;piracy again&s;t the king; and a corre&s;|pondence was &s;ettled between the malecontents in England and tho&s;e in Flanders.</P>
<P>While the plot was thus carrying on in all quarters, Henry was not inattentive to the de&s;igns of his ene|mies. He &s;pared neither labour nor expence to de|tect the fal&s;ehood of the pretender to his crown; and was equally a&s;&s;iduous in finding out who were his &s;e|cret abettors. For this purpo&s;e he di&s;per&s;ed his &s;pies through all Flanders, and brought over, by large bribes, &s;ome of tho&s;e whom he knew to be in the enemies intere&s;ts. Among the&s;e, Sir Robert Clifford was the mo&s;t remarkable, both for his con&s;equence, and the confidence with which he was tru&s;ted. From this per&s;on Henry learnt the whole of Perkin's birth and adventures, together with the names of all tho&s;e who had &s;ecretly combined to a&s;&s;i&s;t him. The king was plea&s;ed with the di&s;covery; but the more tru&s;t he gave to his &s;pies, the higher re&s;entment did he feign again&s;t them.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t he was &s;truck with indignation at the ingratitude of many of tho&s;e about him; but con|cealing his re&s;entment for a proper opportunity, he, almo&s;t at the &s;ame in&s;tant, arre&s;ted Fitzwater, Mount|fort, and Thwaits, together with William Danbery, Robert Ratcliff, Thomas Cre&s;&s;enor, and Thomas A&s;twood. All the&s;e were arraigned, convicted, and condemned for high trea&s;on. Mountfort, Ratcliff,
<PB N="130" REF="139">
and Danbery, were immediately executed; the re&s;t received pardon.</P>
<P>The young adventurer finding his hopes fru&s;trated in England, went next to try his fortune in Scotland. In that country his luck &s;eemed greater than in Eng|land. James the Fourth, the king of that country, received him with great cordiality; he was &s;educed to believe the &s;tory of his birth and adventures; and he carried his confidence &s;o far, as to give him in marriage lady Catharine Gordon, daughter to the earl of Huntley; and a near kin&s;woman of his own; a young lady eminent for virtue as well as beauty. But not content with the&s;e in&s;tances of favour, he was re&s;olved to attempt &s;etting him on the throne of England. It was naturally expected, that upon Per|kin's fir&s;t appearance in that kingdom, all the friends of the hou&s;e of York would ri&s;e in his favour. Upon this ground, therefore, the king of Scotland entered England with a numerous army, and proclaimed the young adventurer wherever he went. But Perkin's preten&s;ions, attended by repeated di&s;appointments, were now become &s;tale even in the eyes of the popu|lace; &s;o that, contrary to expectation, none were found to &s;econd his preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>In this manner the re&s;tle&s;s Perkin being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1497.</NOTE> and meeting with a very cold reception from the Flemings, who now de&s;ired to be at peace with the Engli&s;h, re|&s;olved to continue his &s;cheme of oppo&s;ition; and took refuge among the wilds and fa&s;tne&s;&s;es of Ireland. Im|patient of an inactive life, he held a con&s;ultation with his followers, Herne, Skelton, and A&s;tley, three broken trade&s;men; and by their advice he re&s;olved to try the affections of the Corni&s;h men, and he no &s;ooner made his appearance among them at Bodmin in Cornwall than the populace, to the number of three thou&s;and flocked to his &s;tandard. Elated with this appearance of &s;ucce&s;s, he took on him, for the fir&s;t time, the
<PB N="131" REF="140">
title of Richard the Fourth, king of England; and, not to &s;uffer the &s;pirits of his adherents to langui&s;h, he led them to the gates of Exeter. Finding the inha|bitants ob&s;tinate in refu&s;ing to admit him, and being unprovided with artillery to force an entrance, he broke up the &s;iege of Exeter, and retired to Taunton. His followers by this time amounted to &s;even thou|&s;and men, and appeared ready to defend his cau&s;e: but his heart failed him, upon being informed that the king was coming down to oppo&s;e him; and in|&s;tead of bringing his men into the field, he privately de&s;erted them, and took &s;anctuary in the mona&s;tery of Beaulieu, in the New Fore&s;t. His wretched adherents, left to the king's mercy, found him &s;till willing to pardon; and, except a few of the ring-leaders, none were treated with capital &s;everity. At the &s;ame time &s;ome per&s;ons were employed to treat with Perkin, and to per&s;uade him, under promi&s;e of a pardon, to deliver him&s;elf up to ju&s;tice, and to confe&s;s and explain all the circum&s;tances of his impo&s;ture. His affairs being altogether de&s;perate, he embraced the king's offers, without he&s;itation, and quitted the &s;anctuary. Henry being de&s;irous of &s;ee|ing him, he was brought to court, and conducted through the &s;treets of London in a kind of mock tri|umph, amid&s;t the deri&s;ion and in&s;ults of the popu|lace, which he bore with the mo&s;t dignified re&s;igna|tion. He was then compelled to &s;ign a confe&s;&s;ion of his former life and conduct, which was printed and di&s;per&s;ed throughout the nation: but it was &s;o defec|tive and contradictory, that in&s;tead of explaining the pretended impo&s;ture, it left it &s;till more doubtful than before; and this youth's real preten&s;ions are to this very day an object of di&s;pute among the learned.</P>
<P>After attempting once or twice to e&s;cape from cu&s;|tody, he was hanged at Tyburn, and &s;everal of his adherents &s;uffered the &s;ame ignominious death.</P>
<P>There had been hitherto nothing in this reign but plots, trea&s;ons, in&s;urrections, impo&s;tures, and exe|cutions;
<PB N="132" REF="141">
and it is probable that Henry's &s;everity proceeded from the continual alarms in which they held him. It is certain, that no prince ever loved peace more than he; and much of the ill-will of his &s;ubjects aro&s;e from his attempts to repre&s;s their in|clinations for war. The u&s;ual preface to all his trea|ties was, "That when Chri&s;t came into the world peace was &s;ung; and when he went out of the world peace was bequeathed."</P>
<P>He had all along two points in view; one to de|pre&s;s the nobility and clergy, and the other to exalt and humanize the populace. With this view he pro|cured an act, by which the nobility were granted a power of di&s;po&s;ing of their e&s;tates; a law infinitely plea&s;ing to the commons, and not di&s;agreeable even to the nobles, &s;ince they had thus an immediate re|&s;ource for &s;upplying their ta&s;te for prodigality, and an&s;wering the demands of their creditors. The blow reached them in their po&s;terity alone; but they were too ignorant to be affected by &s;uch di&s;tant di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>He was not le&s;s remi&s;s in abridging the pope's power, while, at the &s;ame time, he profe&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his commands, and the greate&s;t re&s;pect for the clergy. But while he thus employed his power in lowering the influence of the nobles and clergy, he was u&s;ing every art to extend the privi|leges of the people. In fact, his greate&s;t efforts were directed to promote trade and commerce, becau&s;e this naturally introduced a &s;pirit of liberty, and di&s;engaged them from all dependence, except upon the laws and the king. Before this great aera, all our towns owed their original to &s;ome &s;trong ca&s;tle in the neighbour|hood, where &s;ome powerful lord generally re&s;ided. The&s;e were at once fortre&s;&s;es for protection, and pri|&s;ons for all &s;orts of criminals. In this ca&s;tle there was u&s;ually a garri&s;on armed and provided, depend|ing entirely on the nobleman's &s;upport and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. To the&s;e &s;eats of protection, artificers, victuallers,
<PB N="133" REF="142">
and &s;hop-keepers, naturally re&s;orted, and &s;ettled on &s;ome adjacent &s;pot to furni&s;h the lord and his attend|ants with all the nece&s;&s;aries they might require. The farmers al&s;o, and the hu&s;bandmen in the neigh|bourhood, built their hou&s;es there to be protected again&s;t the numerous gangs of robbers, called Ro|bert&s;men, that hid them&s;elves in the woods by day, and infe&s;ted the open country by night. Henry en|deavoured to bring the towns from &s;uch a neighbour|bood, by inviting the inhabitants to a more commer|cial &s;ituation. He attempted to teach them frugality, and a ju&s;t payment of debts, by his own example; and never once omitted the rights of the merchant, in all his treaties with foreign princes.</P>
<P>Henry having thus &s;een England in a great mea|&s;ure civilized by his endeavours, his people pay their taxes without con&s;traint, the nobles confe&s;&s;ing &s;ubor|dination, the laws alone inflicting puni&s;hment, the towns beginning to live independant of the powerful, commerce every day encrea&s;ing, the &s;pirit of faction extingui&s;hed, and foreigners either fearing England or &s;eeking its alliance, he began to &s;ee the ap|proaches of his end,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1509.</NOTE> and died of the gout in his &s;tomach, having lived fifty-two years, and reigned twenty-three. Since the times of Alfred, England had not &s;een &s;uch another king. He rendered his &s;ubjects powerful and happy, and wrought a greater change in the manners of the peo|ple, than it was po&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e could be effected in &s;o &s;hort a time.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII. HENRY VIII.</HEAD>
<P>NO prince ever came to the throne with a con|juncture of circum&s;tances more in his favour than Henry VIII. who now, in the eigh|teenth year of his age,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1509.</NOTE> undertook the go|vernment of the kingdom.</P>
<P>And as he was at the head of a formid|able army, fifty thou&s;and &s;trong, and as a war with France was the mo&s;t plea&s;ing to the people, he determined to head his forces for the conque&s;t of that kingdom. But France was not threatened by him alone; the Swi&s;s, on another quarter, with twenty-five thou&s;and men, were preparing to invade it; while Ferdinand of Arragon, whom no treaties could bind, was only waiting for a convenient opportunity of attack on his &s;ide to advantage. Never was the French monarchy in &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ed a &s;ituation; but the errors of its a&s;&s;ailants procured its &s;afety.</P>
<P>After an o&s;tentatious but ineffectual campaign, a truce was concluded between the two kingdoms; and Henry continued to di&s;&s;ipate, in more peaceful fol|lies, tho&s;e immen&s;e &s;ums which had been ama&s;&s;ed by his predece&s;&s;or for very different purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>In this manner, while his plea&s;ures on the one hand engro&s;&s;ed Henry's time, the preparations for repeated expeditions exhau&s;ted his trea&s;ures on the other. As it was natural to &s;uppo&s;e the old mini&s;|ters, who were appointed to direct him by his father, would not willingly concur in the&s;e idle projects, Henry had, for &s;ome time, di&s;continued a&s;king their advice, and chiefly con&s;ided in the coun&s;els of Tho|mas, afterwards cardinal Wol&s;ey, who &s;eemed to &s;e|cond him in his favourite pur&s;uits. Wol&s;ey was a
<PB N="135" REF="144">
mini&s;ter who complied with all his ma&s;ter's inclina|tions, and flattered him in every &s;cheme to which his &s;anguine and impetuous temper was inclined. He was the &s;on of a private gentleman, and not of a butcher, as is commonly reported, of Ip&s;wich. He was &s;ent to Oxford &s;o early, that he was a bachelor at fourteen, and at that time was called the Boy Ba|chelor. He ro&s;e by degrees, upon quitting college, from one preferment to another, till he was made rec|or of Lymington by the marquis of Dor&s;et, who&s;e children he had in&s;tructed. He had not long re&s;ided at this living, when one of the ju&s;tices of the peace put him in the &s;tocks for being drunk, and rai&s;ing di&s;turbances at a neighbouring fair. This di&s;grace, however, did not retard his promotion; for he was re|commended as chaplain to Henry the Seventh; and being employed by that monarch in a &s;ecret negotia|tion re&s;pecting his intended marriage with Margaret of Savoy, he acquitted him&s;elf to that king's &s;atisfac|tion, and obtained the prai&s;e both of diligence and dexterity. That prince having given him a commi&s;|&s;ion to Maximilian, who, at that time, re&s;ided at Bru&s;|&s;els, was &s;urpri&s;ed in le&s;s than three days after to &s;ee Wol&s;ey pre&s;ent him&s;elf before him; and, &s;uppo&s;ing that he had been delinquent, began to reprove his delay. Wol&s;ey, however, &s;urpri&s;ed him with a&s;&s;ur|ances that he was ju&s;t returned from Bru&s;&s;els, and had &s;ucce&s;sfully fulfilled all his maje&s;ty's commands. His di&s;patch, on that occa&s;ion, procured him the deanery of Lincoln, and in this &s;ituation it was that he was introduced by Fox, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, to the young king's notice, in hopes that he would have talents to &s;upplant the earl of Surry, who was favourite at that time, and in this Fox was not out in his conjectures. Pre&s;ently after, being introduced at court, he was made a privy coun&s;ellor; and as &s;uch, had frequent opportunities of ingratiating him&s;elf with the young king, as he appeared at once complying, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive,
<PB N="136" REF="145">
and enterpri&s;ing. Wol&s;ey u&s;ed every art to &s;uit him|&s;elf to the royal temper; he &s;ung, laughed, and danced with every libertine of the court: neither his own years, which were near forty, nor his cha|racter as a clergyman, were any re&s;traint upon him, or tended to check, by ill-timed &s;everities, the gaiety of his companions. To &s;uch a weak and vicious mo|narch as Henry, qualities of this nature were highly plea&s;ing; and Wol&s;ey was &s;oon acknowledged as his chief favourite, and to him was entru&s;ted the chief ad|mini&s;tration of affairs. The people began to &s;ee with indignation the new favourite's mean conde&s;cen&s;ions to the king, and his arrogance to them&s;elves. They had long regarded the vicious haughtine&s;s, and the unbecoming &s;plendour of the clergy, with envy and dete&s;tation; and Wol&s;ey's greatne&s;s &s;erved to bring a new odium upon that body, already too much the object of the people's di&s;like. His character being now placed in a more con&s;picuous point of light, daily began to manife&s;t it&s;elf the more. In&s;atiable in his acqui&s;itions, but &s;till more magnificent in his expence; of exten&s;ive capacity, but &s;till more un|bounded in enterprize; ambitious of power, but &s;till more de&s;irous of glory; in&s;inuating, engaging, per|&s;ua&s;ive, and at other times, lofty, elevated, and com|manding: haughty to his equals, but affable to his dependants; oppre&s;&s;ive to the people, but liberal to his friends; more generous than grateful; formed to take the a&s;cendant in every intercour&s;e, but vain enough not to cover his real &s;uperiority.</P>
<P>In order to divert the envy of the public from his inordinate exaltation, he &s;oon entered into a cor|re&s;pondence with Francis the Fir&s;t, of France, who had taken many methods to work upon his vanity, and at la&s;t &s;ucceeded. In con&s;equence of that mo|narch's wi&s;hes, Henry was per&s;uaded by the cardinal to an interview with that prince. This expen&s;ive congre&s;s was held between Gui&s;nes and Ardres, near
<PB N="137" REF="146">
Calais, within the Engli&s;h pale, in compliment to Henry for cro&s;&s;ing the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Some months before a defiance had been &s;ent by the two kings to each other's court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1520.</NOTE> and through all the chief cities of Europe, importing, that Henry and Francis, with fourteen aids, would be ready in the plains of Picardy to an&s;wer all comers that were gentlemen, at tilt and tourney. Accordingly, the monarchs now all gorgeou&s;ly apparelled, entered the li&s;ts on hor&s;eback, Francis &s;urrounded with Henry's guards, and Henry with tho&s;e of Francis. They were both at that time the mo&s;t comely per&s;onages of their age, and prided them&s;elves on their expertne&s;s in the mili|tary exerci&s;es. The ladies were the judges in the&s;e feats of chivalry; and they put an end to the en|counter whenever they thought proper. It is &s;up|po&s;ed that the crafty French monarch was willing to gratify Henry's vanity by allowing him to enjoy a petty pre-eminence in the&s;e pa&s;times. He ran a tilt again&s;t Mon&s;ieur Grandeval, whom he di&s;abled at the &s;econd encounter. He engaged Mon&s;ieur de Montmorency, whom, however, he could not throw from the &s;addle. He fought at faulchion with a French nobleman, who pre&s;ented him with his cour&s;er, in token of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>By this time, all the immen&s;e trea&s;ures of the late king were quite exhau&s;ted on empty pageants, guilty plea&s;ures, or vain treaties and expeditions. But the king relied on Wol&s;ey alone for repleni&s;hing his cof|fers; and no per&s;on could be fitter for the purpo&s;e. His fir&s;t care was to get a large &s;um of money from the people, under the title of a benevolence, which added to its being extorted the mortification of being con&s;idered as a free gift. Henry little minded the manner of its being rai&s;ed, provided he had the en|joyment of it; however, his mini&s;ter met with &s;ome oppo&s;ition in his attempts to levy the&s;e extorted con|tributions.
<PB N="138" REF="147">
In the fir&s;t place, having exacted a con|&s;iderable &s;ub&s;idy from the clergy, he next addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the hou&s;e of commons; but they only granted him half the &s;upplies he demanded. Wol|&s;ey was at fir&s;t highly offended at their par&s;imony, and de&s;ired to be heard in the hou&s;e; but as this would have de&s;troyed the very form and con&s;titution of that augu&s;t body, they replied, that none could be permitted to &s;it and argue there, but &s;uch as had been elected members. This was the fir&s;t attempt made in this reign to render the king ma&s;ter of the de|bates in parliament. Wol&s;ey fir&s;t paved the way; and, unfortunately for the kingdom, Henry too well improved upon his plans &s;oon after.</P>
<P>Hitherto the admini&s;tration of all affairs was car|ried on by Wol&s;ey; for the king was contented to lo&s;e, in the embraces of his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, all the com|plaints of his &s;ubjects; and the cardinal undertook to keep him ignorant, in order to continue his own uncontrolled authority. But now a period was ap|proaching, that was to put an end to this mini&s;ter's exorbitant power. One of the mo&s;t extraordinary and important revolutions that ever employed the at|tention of man, was now ripe for execution. This was no le&s;s a change than the Reformation.</P>
<P>The vices and impo&s;itions of the church of Rome were now almo&s;t come to a head; and the encrea&s;e of arts and learning among the laity, propagated by means of printing, which had been lately invented, began to make them re&s;i&s;t that power, which was originally founded in deceit.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1519.</NOTE> Leo the Tenth was at that time pope, and eagerly employed in building the church of St. Peter at Rome. In order to procure mo|ney for carrying on that expen&s;ive undertaking, he gave a commi&s;&s;ion for &s;elling indulgences, a practice that had been often tried before. The&s;e were to free the purcha&s;er from the pains of purgatory; and
<PB N="139" REF="148">
they would &s;erve even for one's friends, if purcha&s;ed with that intention. There were every where &s;hops opened, where they were to be &s;old; but in general they were to be had at taverns, brothels, and gaming hou&s;es. The Augu&s;tine friars had u&s;ually been em|ployed in Saxony to preach the indulgences, and from this tru&s;t had derived both profit and con&s;ider|ation; but the pope's mini&s;ter &s;uppo&s;ing that they had found out illicit methods of &s;ecreting the money, transferred this lucrative employment from them to the Dominicans. Martin Luther, profe&s;&s;or in the univer&s;ity of Wirtemberg, was an Augu&s;tine monk, and one of tho&s;e who re&s;ented this transfer of the &s;ale of indulgencies from one order to another. He began to &s;hew his indignation by preaching again&s;t their efficacy; and being naturally of a fiery temper, and provoked by oppo&s;ition, he inveighed again&s;t the authority of the pope him&s;elf. Being driven hard by his adver&s;aries, &s;till as he enlarged his read|ing, in order to &s;upport his tenets, he di&s;covered &s;ome new abu&s;e or error in the church of Rome. In this di&s;pute, it was the fate of Henry to be a champion on both &s;ides. His father, who had given him the education of a &s;cholar, permitted him to be in&s;tructed in &s;chool-divinity, which then was the principal object of learned enquiry. Henry, there|fore, willing to convince the world of his abilities in that &s;cience, obtained the pope's permi&s;&s;ion to read the works of Luther, which had been forbidden, under pain of excommunication. In con&s;equence of this, the king defended the &s;even &s;acraments, out of St. Thomas Aquinas; and &s;hewed &s;ome dexterity in this &s;cience, though it is thought that Wol&s;ey had the chief hand in directing him. A book being thus fini&s;hed in ha&s;te, it was &s;ent to Rome for the pope's approbation, which it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e would not be with-held. The pontiff, ravi&s;hed with its elo|quence and depth, compared it to the labours of St.
<PB N="140" REF="149">
Jerome or St. Augu&s;tine; and rewarded the author with the title of DEFENDER OF THE FAITH, little imagining that Henry was &s;oon to be one of the mo&s;t terrible enemies that ever the church of Rome had to contend with.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1527.</NOTE>Henry had now been eighteen years married to Catharine of Arragon, who, had been brought over from Spain, and married his elder brother, who died a few months after co-habitation. But notwith&s;tanding the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive deference paid to the indulgence of the church, Henry's marriage with this prince&s;s did not pa&s;s without &s;cruple and he&s;itation, both on his own &s;ide, and on that of the people. However, it was carried forward, though perhaps not at fir&s;t ex|cited, by a motive much more powerful than the tacit &s;ugge&s;tions of his con&s;cience. It happened that among the maids of honour then attend|ing the queen, there was one Anna Bullen, the daughter of Sir Thomas Bullen, a gentleman of di&s;tinction, and related to mo&s;t of the nobility. He had been employed by the king in &s;everal emba&s;&s;ies, and was married to a daughter of the duke of Nor|folk. The beauty of Anna &s;urpa&s;&s;ed whatever had hitherto appeared at this voluptuous court; and her education, which had been at Paris, tended to &s;et off her per&s;onal charms. Her features were regular, mild, and attractive, her &s;tature elegant, though be|low the middle &s;ize, while her wit and vivacity ex|ceeded even her other allurements. Henry, who had never learned the art of re&s;training any pa&s;&s;ion that he de&s;ired to gratify, &s;aw and loved her; but after &s;everal efforts to induce her to comply with his cri|minal de&s;ires, he found that without marriage he could have no chance of &s;ucceeding. This ob&s;tacle, therefore, he hardily undertook to remove; and as his own queen was now become hateful to him, in order to procure a divorce, he alledged that his con|&s;cience
<PB N="141" REF="150">
rebuked him for having &s;o long lived in in|ce&s;t with the wife of his brother. In this pretended perplexity, therefore, he appplied to Clement the Seventh, who owed him many obligations, de&s;iring to di&s;&s;olve the bull of the former pope, which had given him permi&s;&s;ion to marry Catharine; and to de|clare that it was not in the power, even of the holy &s;ee, to di&s;pen&s;e with a law &s;o &s;trictly enjoined in &s;crip|ture. The unfortunate pope, unwilling to grant, yet afraid to refu&s;e, continued to promi&s;e, recant, di&s;pute, and temporize; hoping that the king's pa&s;|&s;ion would never hold out during the tedious cour&s;e of an eccle&s;ia&s;tical controver&s;y. In this he was en|tirely mi&s;taken. Henry had been long taught to di&s;|pute as well as he, and quickly found, or wre&s;ted many texts of &s;cripture to favour his opinions or his pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>During the cour&s;e of a long perplexing negocia|tion, on the i&s;&s;ue of which Henry's happine&s;s &s;eemed to depend, he had at fir&s;t expected to find in his fa|vourite Wol&s;ey, a warm defender, and a &s;teady ad|herent; but in this he found him&s;elf mi&s;taken. Wol&s;ey &s;eemed to be in pretty much the &s;ame dilem|ma with the pope. On the one hand, he was to plea&s;e his ma&s;ter the king, from whom he had re|ceived a thou&s;and marks of favour; and on the other hand, he feared to di&s;oblige the pope, who&s;e &s;ervant he more immediately was, and who be&s;ides had power to puni&s;h his di&s;obedience. He, therefore, re&s;olved to continue neuter in this controver&s;y; and though of all men the mo&s;t haughty, he gave way on this oc|ca&s;ion to Campegio, the pope's nuncio, in all things, pretending a deference to his &s;kill in canon law. Wol&s;ey's &s;cheme of temporizing was highly di&s;plea|&s;ing to the king, but for a while he endeavoured to &s;tifle his re&s;entment, until it could act with more fatal certainty. He for &s;ome time looked out for a man of equal abilities and le&s;s art; and it was not
<PB N="142" REF="151">
long before accident threw into his way one Thomas Cranmer, of greater talents, and probably of more integrity.</P>
<P>Thus finding him&s;elf provided with a per&s;on who could &s;upply Wol&s;ey's place, he appeared le&s;s re&s;erv|ed in his re&s;entments again&s;t that prelate. The attorney-general was ordered to prepare a bill of in|dictment again&s;t him; and he was &s;oon after com|manded to re&s;ign the great &s;eal. Crimes are ea&s;ily found out again&s;t a favourite in di&s;grace, and the courtiers did not fail to encrea&s;e the catalogue of his errors. He was ordered to depart from York-place palace; and all his furniture and plate were convert|ed to the king's u&s;e. The inventory of his goods being taken, they were found to exeed even the mo&s;t extravagant &s;urmi&s;es. Of fine holland alone there were found a thou&s;and pieces; the walls of his pa|lace were covered with cloth of gold and &s;ilver; he had a cup-board of plate of ma&s;&s;y gold; all the re&s;t of his riches and furniture were in proportion, and probably their greatne&s;s invited the hand of power. He was &s;oon after arre&s;ted by the earl of Northum|berland, at the king's command, for high trea&s;on, and preparations were made for conducting him, from York, where he then re&s;ided, to London, in order to take his trial. He at fir&s;t refu&s;ed to comply with the requi&s;ition, as being a cardinal; but finding the earl bent on performing his commi&s;&s;ion, he com|plied, and &s;et out, by ea&s;y journies, for London, to appear as a criminal, where he had acted as a king. In his way he &s;tayed a fortnight at the earl of Shrew&s;|bury's; where, one day at dinner, he was taken ill, not without violent &s;u&s;picions of having poi&s;oned him|&s;elf. Being brought forward from thence, he with much difficulty reached Leice&s;ter Abbey; where the monks coming out to meet him, he &s;aid, "Father abbot, I am come to lay my bones among you; and immediately ordered his bed to be prepared. As
<PB N="143" REF="152">
his di&s;order encrea&s;ed, an officer being placed near, at once to guard and attend him, he &s;poke to him a little before he expired, to this effect; "I pray you have me heartily recommended unto his royal maje&s;|ty, he is a prince of a mo&s;t royal carriage, and hath a princely heart, and rather than he will mi&s;s, or want any part of his will, he will endanger one half of his kingdom. I do a&s;&s;ure you, I have kneeled before him for three hours together, to per&s;uade him from his will and appetite, but could not prevail. Had I but &s;erved God as diligently as I have &s;erved the king, he would not have given me over in my grey hairs. But this is the ju&s;t reward that I mu&s;t receive for my indulgent pains and &s;tudy; not regarding my &s;ervice to God but only to my prince." He died &s;oon after, in all the pangs of remor&s;e, and left a life which he had all along rendered turbid by ambition, and wretched by mean a&s;&s;iduities.</P>
<P>The tie that held Henry to the church being thus broken, he re&s;olved to keep no further mea&s;ures with the pontiff. He therefore privately married Anna Bullen, whom he had created marchione&s;s of Pembroke, the duke of Norfolk, uncle to the new queen, her father, mother, and doctor Cranmer be|ing pre&s;ent at the ceremony. Soon after finding the queen pregnant, he publicly owned his marriage, and, to colour over his di&s;obedience to the pope with an appearance of triumph, he pa&s;&s;ed with his beauti|ful bride through London, with a magnificence great|er than had been ever known before. But though Henry had thus &s;eparated from the church, yet he had not addicted him&s;elf to the &s;y&s;tem of any other reformer.</P>
<P>As the mode of religion was not as yet known, and as the minds of tho&s;e who were of oppo&s;ite &s;entiments were extremely exa&s;perated, it naturally followed that &s;everal mu&s;t fall a &s;acrifice in the conte&s;t between ancient e&s;tabli&s;hments and modern reformation.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="153">As the monks had all along &s;hewn him the great|e&s;t re&s;i&s;tance, he re&s;olved at once to deprive them of future power to injure him. He accordingly em|powered Thomas Cromwell, who was now made &s;e|cretary of &s;tate, to &s;end, commi&s;&s;ioners into the &s;e|veral counties of England to in&s;pect the mona&s;te|ries; and to report, with rigorous exactne&s;s, the con|duct and deportment of &s;uch as were re&s;ident there. This employment was readily undertaken by &s;ome creatures of the court, namely, Layton, London, Price, Gage, Petre, and Bela&s;is, who are &s;aid to have di&s;covered mon&s;trous di&s;orders in many of the religious hou&s;es. Whole convents of women aban|doned to all manner of lewdne&s;s, friars accomplices in their crimes, pious frauds every where practi&s;ed to encrea&s;e the devotion and liberality of the people, and cruel and inveterate factions maintained between the members of many of the&s;e in&s;titutions. The&s;e accu&s;ations, whether true or fal&s;e, were urged with great clamour again&s;t the&s;e communities, and a gene|ral horror was excited in the nation again&s;t them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1536.</NOTE>A new vi&s;itation was &s;oon after appointed, and fre&s;h crimes were al&s;o produced; &s;o that his &s;everities were conducted with &s;uch &s;eeming ju&s;tice and &s;ucce&s;s, that in le&s;s than two years he became po&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the mona&s;tic reve|nues. The&s;e, on the whole, amounted to &s;ix hundred and forty-five, of which twenty-eight had abbots, who en|joyed a &s;eat in parliament. Ninety colleges were demo|li&s;hed in &s;everal counties; two thou&s;and three hundred and &s;eventy-four chantries, and free chapels, and an hundred and ten ho&s;pitals. The whole revenue of the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments amounted to one hundred and &s;ixty one thou&s;and pounds, which was about a twentieth part of the national income. But as great murmurs were excited by &s;ome upon this occa&s;ion, Henry took care that all tho&s;e who could be u&s;eful to him, or even dangerous in ca&s;es of oppo&s;ition,
<PB N="145" REF="154">
&s;hould be &s;harers in the &s;poil. He either made a gift of the revenues of the convents to his principal cour|tiers, or &s;old them at low prices, or exchanged them for other lands on very di&s;advantageous terms.</P>
<P>Henry's opinions were at length delivered in a law, which, from its horrid con&s;equences, was afterwards termed the Bloody Statute, by which it was ordained, that whoever, by word or writing, denied tran&s;ub|&s;tantiation, whoever maintained that the communion in both kinds was nece&s;&s;ary, whoever a&s;&s;erted that it was lawful for prie&s;ts to marry, whoever alledged that vows of cha&s;tity might be broken, whoever maintain|ed that private ma&s;&s;es were unprofitable, or that au|ricular confe&s;&s;ion was unnece&s;&s;ary, &s;hould be found guilty of here&s;y, and burned or hanged as the court &s;hould determine. As the people were at that time chiefly compo&s;ed of tho&s;e who followed the opinions of Luther, and &s;uch as &s;till adhered to the pope, this &s;tatute, with Henry's former decrees, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure excluded both, and opened a field for per&s;ecu+tion, which &s;oon after produced its dreadful harve&s;ts. Bainham and Bilney were burned for their oppo&s;i|tion to popery, Sir Thomas More and bi&s;hop Fi&s;her were beheaded for denying the king's &s;upremacy.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;everities, however, were preceded by one of a different nature, ari&s;ing neither from religious nor political cau&s;es, but merely from tyrannical ca|price. Anne Bullen, his queen, had been always a favourer of the reformation, and con&s;equently had many enemies on that account, who only waited &s;ome fit occa&s;ion to de&s;troy her credit with the king; and that occa&s;ion pre&s;ented it&s;elf but too &s;oon. The king's pa&s;&s;ion was by this time quite palled by &s;atiety; as the only de&s;ire he ever had for her aro&s;e from that brutal appetite, which enjoyment &s;oon de&s;troys, he was now, fallen in love, if we may &s;o pro&s;titute the expre&s;&s;ion, with another, and langui&s;hed for the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion

of Jane Seymour, who had for &s;ome time been maid of honour to the queen.</P>
<P>In the mean time her enemies were not remi&s;s in rai&s;ing an accu&s;ation again&s;t her. The duke of Norfolk, from his attachment to the old religion, took care to produce &s;everal witne&s;&s;es accu&s;ing her of incontinency with &s;ome of the meaner &s;ervants of the court. Four per&s;ons were particularly pointed out as her paramours; Henry Norris, groom of the &s;tole, We&s;ton, and Brereton, gentlemen of the king's bed-chamber, together with mark Smeton, a mu&s;i|cian. Accordingly &s;oon after Norris, We&s;ton, Brere|ton and Smeton were tried in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, when Smeton was prevailed upon, by the promi&s;e of a pardon, to confe&s;s a criminal corre&s;pondence with the queen; but he was never confronted by her he accu&s;ed; and his execution with the re&s;t, &s;hortly after, &s;erved to acquit her of the charge. Norris, who had been much in the king's favour, had an offer of his life, if he would confe&s;s his crime and accu&s;e his mi&s;tre&s;s; but he rejected the propo&s;al with contempt, and died profe&s;&s;ing her innocence, and his own.</P>
<P>The queen and her brother were tried by a jury of peers; but upon what proof or pretence the crime of ince&s;t was urged again&s;t them is unknown; the chief evidence, it is &s;aid, amounted to no more, than that Rochford had been &s;een to lean on her bed before &s;ome company. Part of the charge again&s;t her was, that &s;he had declared to her attendants, that the king never had her heart; which was con&s;idered as a &s;lan|der upon the throne, and &s;trained into a breach of a late &s;tatute, by which it was declared criminal to throw any &s;lander upon the king, queen, or their i&s;&s;ue. The unhappy queen, though una&s;&s;i&s;ted by coun&s;el, defended her&s;elf with great judgment, and pre&s;ence of mind; and the &s;pectators could not for|bear declaring her entirely innocent. She an&s;wered
<PB N="147" REF="158">
di&s;tinctly to all the charges brought again&s;t her: but the king's authority was not to be controuled; &s;he was declared guilty; and her &s;entence ran, that &s;he &s;hould be burned or beheaded at the king's plea&s;ure. On the morning of her execution, her &s;entence being mitigated into beheading, &s;he &s;ent for King&s;tone, the keeper of the Tower, to whom, upon entering the pri&s;on, &s;he &s;aid, "Mr. King&s;tone, I hear I am not to die till noon, and I am &s;orry for it; for I thought to be dead before this time, and free from a life of pain." The keeper attempting to comfort her, by a&s;|&s;uring her the pain would be very little, &s;he replied, "I have heard the executioner is very expert; and (cla&s;ping her neck with her hands, laughing) I have but a little neck." When brought to the &s;caffold, from a con&s;ideration of her child Elizabeth's welfare, &s;he would not enflame the minds of the &s;pectators again&s;t her pro&s;ecutors, but contented her&s;elf with &s;aying, "that &s;he was come to die as &s;he was &s;en|tenced by the law." She would accu&s;e none, nor &s;ay any thing of the ground upon which &s;he was judged; &s;he prayed heartily for the king, and called him "a mo&s;t merciful, and gentle prince; that he had always been to her a good and gracious &s;overeign; and that if any one &s;hould think proper to canva&s;s her cau&s;e, &s;he de&s;ired him to judge the be&s;t." She was beheaded by the executioner of Calais, who was brought over as much more expert than any in England. The very next day after her execution, he married the lady Jane Seymour, his cruel heart being no way &s;oftened by the wretched fate of one that had been &s;o lately the object of his warme&s;t affections. He al&s;o ordered his parliament to give him a divorce between her &s;en|tence and execution; and thus he endeavoured to ba&s;|tardize Elizabeth, the only child he had by her, as he had in the &s;ame manner formerly ba&s;tardized Mary, his only child by queen Catharine.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="159">In the mid&s;t of the&s;e commotions, the fires of Smithfield were &s;een to blaze with unu&s;ual fiercene&s;s.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 12. 1537.</NOTE> Tho&s;e who adhered to the pope, or tho&s;e who followed the doc|trines of Luther, were equally the objects of royal vengeance, and eccle&s;ia&s;tical per&s;ecution. From the multiplied alterations which were made in the nation|al &s;y&s;tems of belief, mo&s;tly drawn up by Henry him|&s;elf, few knew what to think, or what to profe&s;s. They were ready enough, indeed, to follow his doc|trines, how incon&s;i&s;tent or contradictory &s;oever; but as he was continually changing them him&s;elf, they could hardly pur&s;ue &s;o fa&s;t as he advanced before them. Thomas Cromwell, rai&s;ed by the king's ca|price, from being a black&s;mith's &s;on, to be a royal fa|vourite, for tyrants ever rai&s;e their favourites from the lowe&s;t of the people, together with Cranmer, now become archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, were both &s;een to favour the reformation with all their endea|vours. On the other hand, Gardiner bi&s;hop of Win|che&s;ter, together with the duke of Norfolk, were for leading the king back to his original &s;uper&s;tition. In fact, Henry &s;ubmitted to neither; his pride had long been &s;o enflamed by flattery, that he thought him&s;elf entitled to regulate, by his own &s;ingle opinion, the re|ligious faith of the whole nation.</P>
<P>Soon after, no le&s;s than five hundred per&s;ons were impri&s;oned for contradicting the opinions delivered in the bloody &s;tatute; and received protection only from the lenity of Cromwell. Lambert, a &s;chool-ma|&s;ter, and doctor Barnes, who had been in&s;trumental in Lambert's execution, felt the &s;everity of the per|&s;ecuting &s;pirit; and by a bill in parliament, without any trial, were condemned to the flames, di&s;cu&s;&s;ing theological que&s;tions at the very &s;take. With Barnes were executed one Gerrard, and Jerome, for the &s;ame opinions. Three Catholics al&s;o, who&s;e names were Abel, Fether&s;tone, and Powel, were dragged upon
<PB N="149" REF="160">
the &s;ame hurdles to execution; and declared, that the mo&s;t grievous part of their puni&s;hment, was the being coupled with &s;uch heretical mi&s;creants as were united in the &s;ame calamity.</P>
<P>During the&s;e horrid tran&s;actions, Henry was re|&s;olved to take another queen, Jane Seymour having died in child bed; and, after &s;ome negociation upon the continent, he contracted a marriage with Anne of Cleves, his aim being by her means to fortify his alliances with the princes of Germany. His aver&s;ion, however, to the queen &s;ecretly encrea&s;ed every day; and he at length re&s;olved to get rid of her and his prime mini&s;ter together. He had a &s;trong cau&s;e of di&s;like to him for his late unpropitious alliance; and a new motive was &s;oon added for encrea&s;ing his di&s;plea&s;ure. Henry had fixed his affection on Ca|tharine Howard, niece to the duke of Norfolk; and the only method of gratifying this new pa&s;&s;ion was, as in former ca&s;es, di&s;carding the pre&s;ent queen to make room for a new one. The duke of Norfolk had long been Cromwell's mortal enemy, and eager|ly embraced this opportunity to de&s;troy a man he con&s;idered as his rival. He therefore made u&s;e of all his niece's arts to ruin the favourite; and when his project was ripe for execution, he obtained a com|mi&s;&s;ion from the king to arre&s;t Cromwell for high trea&s;on. His di&s;grace was no &s;ooner known, than all his friends for&s;ook him, except Cranmer, who wrote &s;uch a letter to Henry in his behalf, as no other man in the kingdom would have pre&s;umed to offer. However, he was accu&s;ed in parliament of here&s;y and trea&s;on; and without being ever heard in his own defence, condemned to &s;uffer the pains of death, as the king &s;hould think proper to direct. When he was brought to the &s;caffold, his regard for his &s;on hindered him from expatiating upon his own innocence; he thank|ed God for bringing him to that death for his tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="150" REF="161">
confe&s;&s;ed he had often been &s;educed, but that he now died in the catholic faith.</P>
<P>But the mea&s;ure of his &s;everities was not yet filled up. He had thought him&s;elf very happy in his new marriage. He was &s;o captivated with the queen's accompli&s;hments, that he gave public thanks for his felicity, and de&s;ired his confe&s;&s;or to join with him in the &s;ame thank&s;giving. This joy, however, was of very &s;hort duration. While the king was at York, upon an intended conference with the king of Scot|land, a man of the name of La&s;&s;els waited upon Cran|mer at London; and from the information of this man's &s;i&s;ter, who had been &s;ervant to the dutche&s;s dowager of Norfolk, he gave a very &s;urprizing ac|count of the queen's incontinence. When the queen was fir&s;t examined relative to her crime, &s;he denied the charge; but afterwards finding that her accom|plices were her accu&s;ers, &s;he confe&s;&s;ed her inconti|nence before marriage, but denied her having di&s;|honoured the king's bed &s;ince their union. Three maids of honour, who were admitted to her &s;ecrets, &s;till further alledged her guilt; and &s;ome of them confe&s;&s;ed having pa&s;&s;ed the night in the &s;ame bed with her and her lovers. The &s;ervile parliament, upon being informed of the queen's crime and confe&s;&s;ion, &s;ound her quickly guilty, and petitioned the king that &s;he might be puni&s;hed with death; that the &s;ame penalty might be inflicted on the lady Rochford, the accomplice in her debaucheries; and that her grand|mother, the dutche&s;s dowager of Norfolk, together with her father, mother, and nine others, men and women, as having been privy to the queen's irregu|larities, &s;hould participate in her puni&s;hment. With this petition the king was mo&s;t graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to agree; they were condemned to death by an act of attainder, which at the &s;ame time made it capital for all per&s;ons to conceal their knowledge of the de|baucheries
<PB N="151" REF="162">
of any future queen. It was al&s;o enacted, that if the king married any woman who had been in|continent, taking her for a true maid, &s;he &s;hould be guilty of trea&s;on, in ca&s;e &s;he did not previou&s;ly reveal her guilt. The people made merry with this ab&s;urd and brutal &s;tatute; and it was &s;aid, that the king mu&s;t henceforth look out for a widow. After all the&s;e laws were pa&s;&s;ed, in which the mo&s;t wonderful circum|&s;tance is, that a body of men could ever be induced to give their con&s;ent, the queen was beheaded on Tower Hill, together with the lady Rochford, who found no great degree of compa&s;&s;ion, as &s;he had her|&s;elf before tampered in blood.</P>
<P>In about a year after the death of the la&s;t queen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1543.</NOTE> Henry once more changed his condition, by marrying his &s;ixth and la&s;t wife, Catharine Parr, who according to the ridiculous &s;ugge&s;tions of the people, was, in fact, a widow. She was the wife of the late lord Latimer; and was con&s;idered as a woman of di&s;cretion and virtue. She was already pa&s;&s;ed the meridian of life, and managed this capricious tyrant's temper with pru|dence and &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Still, however, the king's &s;everity to his &s;ubjects continued as fierce as ever. For &s;ome time he had been incommoded by an ulcer in his leg; the pain of which, added to his corpulence, and other infir|mities, encrea&s;ed his natural ira&s;cibility to &s;uch a de|gree, that &s;carce any, of even his dome&s;tics, approach|ed him without terror. It was not to be expected, therefore, that any who differed from him in opinion, &s;hould, at this time, particularly, hope for pardon.</P>
<P>Though his health was declining apace, yet his implacable cruelties were not the le&s;s frequent. His re|&s;entments were diffu&s;ed indi&s;criminately to all: at one time a prote&s;tant, and at another a catholic, were the objects of his &s;everity. The duke of Norfolk

and his &s;on, the earl of Surry, were the la&s;t that felt the inju&s;tice of the tyrant's groundle&s;s &s;u&s;picions. The duke was a nobleman who had &s;erved the king with talents and fidelity; his &s;on was a young man of the mo&s;t promi&s;ing hopes, who excelled in every accompli&s;hment that became a &s;cholar, a courtier, and a &s;oldier. He excelled in all the military exer|ci&s;es which were then in reque&s;t; he encouraged the fine arts by his practice and example; and it is remarkable, that he was the fir&s;t who brought our language, in his poetical pieces, to any degree of re|finement. He celebrated the fair Geraldina in all his &s;onnets, and maintained her &s;uperior beauty in all places of public contention. The&s;e qualifications, however, were no &s;afeguard to him again&s;t Henry's &s;u&s;picions; he had dropt &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of re&s;ent|ment again&s;t the king's mini&s;ters, upon being di&s;|placed from the government of Bologne; and the whole family was become obnoxious from the late incontinency of Catharine Howard, the queen who was executed. From the&s;e motives, therefore, pri|vate orders were given to arre&s;t the father and &s;on; and accordingly they were arre&s;ted both on the &s;ame day, and confined to the Tower. Surry being a com|moner, his trial was the more expeditious; and as to proofs, there were many informers ba&s;e enough to betray the intimacies of private confidence, and all the connections of blood. The dutche&s;s dowager of Richmond, Surry's own &s;i&s;ter, enli&s;ted her&s;elf among the number of his accu&s;ers; and Sir Richard Southwell al&s;o, his mo&s;t intimate friend, charged him with infidelity to the king. It would &s;eem, that at this dreary period, there was neither faith nor honour to be found in all the nation; Surry denied the charge, and challenged his accu&s;er to &s;ingle com|bat. This favour was refu&s;ed him; and it was alledged that he had quartered the arms of Edward the Con|fe&s;&s;or
<PB N="153" REF="164">
on his e&s;cutcheon, which alone was &s;ufficient to convict him of a&s;piring to the crown. To this he could make no reply; and indeed any an&s;wer would have been needle&s;s; for neither parliaments nor juries, during this reign, &s;eem to be guided by any other proofs, but the will of the crown. This young nobleman was, therefore, condemned for high trea&s;on, notwith&s;tanding his eloquent and &s;pirited de|fence; and the &s;entence was &s;oon after executed upon him on Tower-Hill. In the mean time the duke endeavoured to mollify the king by letters and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions; but the mon&s;ter's hard heart was rarely &s;ubject to tender impre&s;&s;ions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

The duke prepared for death, the following morning was to be his la&s;t; but an event of greater con&s;e|quence to the kingdom intervened, and prevented his execution.</P>
<P>The king had been for &s;ome time approaching fa&s;t towards his end; and for &s;everal days all tho&s;e about his per&s;on plainly &s;aw that his &s;peedy death was in|evitable. The di&s;order in his leg was now grown extremely painful; and this added to his mon&s;trous corpulency, which rendered him unable to &s;tir, made him more furious than a chained lion. He had been ever &s;tern and &s;evere; he was now out|rageous. In this &s;tate he had continued for near four years before his death, the terror of all, and the tor|mentor of him&s;elf; his courtiers having no inclina|tion to make an enemy of him, as they were more ardently employed in con&s;piring the death of each other. In this manner, therefore, he was &s;uffered
<PB N="154" REF="165">
to &s;truggle, without any of his dome&s;tics having the courage to warn him of his approaching end, as more than once during this reign, per&s;ons had been put to death for foretelling the death of the king. At la&s;t, Sir Anthony Denny had the courage to di&s;clo&s;e to him this dreadful &s;ecret; and, contrary to his u&s;ual cu&s;tom, he received the tidings with an expre&s;|&s;ion of re&s;ignation. His angui&s;h and remo&s;e was at this time greater than can be expre&s;&s;ed; he de&s;ired that Cranmer might be &s;ent for; but before that pre|late could arrive, he was &s;peechle&s;s. Cranmer de|&s;ired him to give &s;ome &s;ign of his dying in the faith of Chri&s;t, he &s;queezed his hand, and immediately expired,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1547.</NOTE> after a reign of thirty-&s;even years, and nine months, in the fifty-&s;ixth year of his age. Some kings have been tyrants from contradiction and revolt; &s;ome from being mi&s;led by favourites, and &s;ome from a &s;pirit of party. But Henry was cruel from a depraved di&s;|po&s;ition alone; cruel in government, cruel in religion, and cruel in his family. Our divines have taken &s;ome pains to vindicate the character of this brutal prince, as if his conduct, and our reformation had any connexion with each other. There is nothing &s;o ab&s;urd as to defend the one by the other; the mo&s;t noble de&s;igns are brought about by the mo&s;t vicious in&s;truments; for we &s;ee even that cruelty and inju&s;|tice were thought nece&s;&s;ary to be employed in our holy redemption.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV. EDWARD VI.</HEAD>
<P>HENRY the eighth was &s;ucceeded on the throne by his only &s;on Edward the &s;ixth, now in the ninth year of his age. The late king in his will, which he expected would be implicitly obeyed, &s;ixed the majority of the prince at the completion of his eighteenth year; and in the mean time appointed &s;ixteen executors of his will, to whom, during the minority, he entru&s;ted the government of the king and kingdom, the duke of Somer&s;et as protector be|ing placed at their head.</P>
<P>The protector, in his &s;chemes for advancing the reformation, had always recour&s;e to the coun&s;els of Cranmer, who, being a man of moderation and pru|dence, was aver&s;e to violent changes, and determined to bring over the people by in&s;en&s;ible innovations to his own peculiar &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>A committee of bi&s;hops and divines had been ap|pointed by the council to frame a liturgy for the &s;er|vice of the church; and this work was executed with great moderation, preci&s;ion, and accuracy. A law was al&s;o enacted, permitting prie&s;ts to marry; the ceremony of auricular confe&s;&s;ion, though not aboli&s;hed, was left at the di&s;cretion of the people, who were not di&s;|plea&s;ed at being freed from the &s;piritual tyranny of their in&s;tructors; the doctrine of the real pre&s;ence was the la&s;t tenet of popery that was wholly abandon|ed by the people, as both the clergy and laity were loth to renounce &s;o miraculous a benefit as it was a&s;|&s;erted to be. However, at la&s;t, not only this but all the principal opinions and practices of the Catho|lic religion, contrary to what the &s;cripture authorizes, were aboli&s;hed; and the reformation, &s;uch as we
<PB N="156" REF="167">
have it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1549.</NOTE> was almo&s;t entirely completed in England. With all the&s;e innovations the people and clergy in general aquie&s;ced; and Gardiner and Bonner were the only per&s;ons who&s;e oppo&s;ition was thought of any weight; they were, therefore, &s;ent to the Tower, and threat|ened with the king's further di&s;plea&s;ure in ca&s;e of di&s;obedience.</P>
<P>For all the&s;e the protector gained great applau&s;e and popularity; but he was rai&s;ed to an enviable de|gree of eminence, and his enemies were numerous in proportion to his exaltation. Of all the mini&s;ters, at that time in the council, Dudley, earl of War|wick, was the mo&s;t artful, ambitious, and unprinci|pled. Re&s;olved at any rate to po&s;&s;e&s;s the principal place under the king, he cared not what means were to be u&s;ed in acquiring it. However, unwilling to throw off the ma&s;k, he covered the mo&s;t exorbitant views under the faire&s;t appearances. Having a&s;&s;o|ciated him&s;elf with the earl of Southampton, he form|ed a &s;trong party in the council, who were determin|ed to free them&s;elves from the controul the protector a&s;&s;umed over them. That nobleman was, in fact, now grown obnoxious to a very prevailing party in the kingdom. He was hated by the nobles for his &s;uperior magnificence and power; he was hated by the catholic party for his regard to the reformation; he was di&s;liked by many for his &s;everity to his bro|ther: be&s;ides, the great e&s;tate he had rai&s;ed at the ex|pence of the church and the crown, rendered him obnoxious to all. The palace which he was then build|ing in the Strand, &s;erved al&s;o by its magnificence, and &s;till more by the unju&s;t methods that were taken to rai&s;e it, to expo&s;e him to the cen&s;ures of the public. The pari&s;h church of St. Mary, with three bi&s;hop's hou&s;es, were pulled down to furni&s;h ground and ma|terials for the &s;tructure.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="168">He was &s;oon afterwards &s;ent to the Tower, and the chief article of which he was accu&s;ed, was his u&s;ur|pation of the government, and the taking all power into his own hands; but his great riches was the real cau&s;e. Several others of a &s;lighter tint were added to invigorate this accu&s;ation, but none of them could be &s;aid to amount to high trea&s;on. In con&s;equence of the&s;e, a bill of attainder was preferred again&s;t him in the hou&s;e of lords; but Somer&s;et contrived, for this time, to elude the rigour of their &s;entence, by having previou&s;ly, on his knees, confe&s;&s;ed the charge before the members of the council. In con&s;equence of this confe&s;&s;ion, he was deprived of all his offices and goods, together with a great part of his landed e&s;tate, which was forfeited to the u&s;e of the crown. This fine on his e&s;tate was &s;oon after remitted by the king, and Somer&s;et once more, contrary to the ex|pectation of all, recovered his liberty. He was even re-admitted into the council; happy for him, if his ambition had not revived with his &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>In fact, he could not help now and then bur&s;ting out into invectives again&s;t the king and government, which were quickly carried to his &s;ecret enemy, the earl of Warwick, who was now become the duke of Northumberland. As he was &s;urrounded with that nobleman's creatures, they took care to reveal all the de&s;igns which they had them&s;elves fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted; and Somer&s;et &s;oon found the fatal effects of his rival's re&s;entment. He was, by Northumberland's command, arre&s;ted with many more accu&s;ed of being his partizans: and he was, with his wife the duche&s;s, al&s;o thown into pri&s;on. He was now accu&s;ed of having formed a de&s;ign to rai&s;e an in&s;urrection in the North; of at|tacking the train-bands on a mu&s;ter day; of plotting to &s;ecure the Tower, and to excite a rebellion in Lon|don. The&s;e charges he &s;trenuou&s;ly denied; but he confe&s;&s;ed to one of as heinous a nature, which was, that he had laid a project for murdering Northum|berland,
<PB N="158" REF="169">
Northampton, and Pembroke, at a banquet, which was to be given them by lord Paget. He was &s;oon after brought to a trial before the marqui&s;s of Winche&s;ter, who &s;at as high-&s;teward on the occa&s;ion, with twenty-&s;even peers more, including Northum|berland, Pembroke, and Northampton, who were at once his judges and accu&s;ers; and being found guilty, brought to the &s;caffold on Tower-hill, where he appeared, without the lea&s;t emotion, in the mid&s;t of a va&s;t concour&s;e of the populace, by whom he was beloved. He &s;poke to them with great compo&s;ure, prote&s;ting that he had always promoted the &s;ervice of his king, and the intere&s;ts of true religion, to the be&s;t of his power. The people atte&s;ted their belief of what he &s;aid, by crying out, "It is mo&s;t true." An univer&s;al tumult was beginning to take place; but Somer&s;et de&s;iring them to be &s;till, and not to inter|rupt his la&s;t meditations, but to join with him in prayer, he laid down his head, and &s;ubmitted to the &s;troke of the executioner.</P>
<P>In the mean time Northumberland had long aimed at the fir&s;t authority; and the infirm &s;tate of the king's health opened the pro&s;pects to his ambition. He repre&s;ented to that young prince that his &s;i&s;ters Mary and Elizabeth, who were appointed by Henry's will to &s;ucceed in failure of direct heirs to the crown, had been both declared illegitimate by parliament; that the queen of Scots, his aunt, &s;tood excluded by the king's will, and being an alien al&s;o, lo&s;t all right of &s;ucceeding; that as the three prince&s;&s;es were thus legally excluded, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion naturally devolved to the marchione&s;s of Dor&s;et, who&s;e next heir was the lady Jane Grey, a lady every way accompli&s;hed for government, as well by the charms of her per&s;on, as the virtues and acquirements of her mind. The king, who had long &s;ubmitted to all the politic views of this de&s;igning mini&s;ter, agreed to have the &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion &s;ubmitted to council, where Northumberland had
<PB N="159" REF="170">
influence &s;oon after to procure an ea&s;y concur|rence.</P>
<P>In the mean time, as the king's health declined, the mini&s;ter laboured to &s;trengthen his own intere&s;ts and connexions. His fir&s;t aim was to &s;ecure the in|tere&s;ts of the marqui&s;s of Dor&s;et, father to lady Jane Gray, by procuring for him the title of duke of Suf|folk, which was lately become extinct. Having thus obliged this nobleman, he then propo&s;ed a match be|tween his fourth &s;on, lord Guilford Dudley, and the lady Jane Gray, who&s;e intere&s;ts he had been at &s;o much pains to advance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1553.</NOTE> Still bent on &s;preading his intere&s;ts as widely as po&s;&s;ible, he married his own daughter to lord Ha&s;|tings; and had the&s;e marriages &s;olemnized with all po&s;&s;ible pomp and fe&s;tivity. Mean while, Edward continued to langui&s;h; and &s;everal fatal &s;ymptoms of a con&s;umption began to appear. It was hoped, however, that his youth and temperance might get the better of his di&s;orders; and from their love the people were unwilling to think him in dan|ger. It had been remarked indeed by &s;ome, that his health was vi&s;ibly &s;een to decline, from the time that the Dudleys were brought about his per&s;on. The character of Northumberland might have ju&s;tly given &s;ome colour to &s;u&s;picion; and his removing all, ex|cept his own emi&s;&s;aries, from about the king, &s;till farther encrea&s;ed the di&s;tru&s;ts of the people. Nor|thumberland, however, was no way unea&s;y at their murmurs; he was a&s;&s;iduous in his attendance upon the king, and pro&s;e&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t anxious concern for his &s;afety; but &s;till drove forward his darling &s;cheme of transferring the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to his own daughter-in-law.</P>
<P>The young king was put into the hands of an ig|norant woman, who very confidently undertook his cure. After the u&s;e of her medicines, all the bad &s;ymptoms encrea&s;ed to a mo&s;t violent degree; he
<PB N="160" REF="171">
felt a difficulty of &s;peech and breathing; his pul&s;e failed, his legs &s;welled, his colour became livid, and many other &s;ymptoms appeared of his approaching end.<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 6, 1553.</NOTE> He expired at Greenwich, in the &s;ixteenth year of his age, and the &s;eventh of his reign, greatly regretted by all, as his early virtues gave a pro&s;pect of the con|tinuance of an happy reign.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXV. MARY.</HEAD>
<P>UPON the death of Edward two candidates put in their preten&s;ions to the crown. Mary, Henry's daughter by Catharine of Arragon, relying on the ju&s;tice of her cau&s;e, and lady Jane Gray, being nominated in the late young king's will, and upon the &s;upport of the duke of Northumberland, her father-in-law. Mary was &s;trongly bigotted to the popi&s;h &s;uper&s;titions, having been bred up among church-men, and having been even taught to prefer martyrdom to a denial of belief. As &s;he had lived in continual re&s;traint, &s;he was re&s;erved and gloomy: &s;he had, even during the life of her father, the re&s;o|lution to maintain her &s;entiments, and refu&s;ed to comply with his new in&s;titutions. Her zeal had ren|dered her furious; and &s;he was not only blindly at|tached to her religious opinions, but even to the po|pi&s;h clergy who maintained them. On the other hand, Jane Gray was &s;trongly attached to the refor|mers; and though yet but &s;ixteen, her judgment had attained to &s;uch a degree of maturity, as few have been found to po&s;&s;e&s;s. All hi&s;torians agree that the &s;olidity of her under&s;tanding, improved by continual application, rendered her the wonder of her age. Jane, who was in a great mea&s;ure ignorant of all the
<PB N="161" REF="172">
tran&s;actions in her favour, was &s;truck with equal grief and &s;urprize when &s;he received intelligence of them. She &s;hed a flood of tears, appeared incon|&s;olable, and it was not without the utmo&s;t difficulty that &s;he yielded to the entreaties of Northumberland, and the duke her father. Orders were given al&s;o for proclaiming her throughout the kingdom; but the&s;e were but very remi&s;sly obeyed. When &s;he was pro|claimed in the city, the people heard her acce&s;&s;ion made public without any &s;igns of plea&s;ure, no ap|plau&s;e en&s;ued, and &s;ome even expre&s;&s;ed their &s;corn and contempt.</P>
<P>In the mean time Mary, who had retired, upon the news of the king's death, to Kenning Hall in Norfolk, &s;ent circular letters to all the great towns and nobility in the kingdom, reminding them of her right, and commanding them to proclaim her without delay.</P>
<P>Her claims &s;oon became irre&s;i&s;tible; in a little time &s;he found her&s;elf at the head of forty thou&s;and men; while the few who attended Northumberland, con|tinued irre&s;olute; and he even feared to lead them to the encounter.</P>
<P>Lady Jane, thus finding that all was lo&s;t, re&s;igned her royalty, which &s;he had held but ten days, with marks of real &s;atisfaction, and retired with her mother to their own habitation. Northumberland al&s;o, who found his affairs de&s;perate, and that it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;tem the tide of popular oppo&s;ition, attempted to quit the kingdom; but he was prevented by the band of pen&s;ioner guards, who informed him that he mu&s;t &s;tay to ju&s;tify their conduct in being led out again&s;t their lawful &s;overeign. Thus circumvented on all &s;ides, he delivered him&s;elf up to Mary, and was &s;oon after executed in a &s;ummary way. Sentence was al&s;o pronounced again&s;t lady Jane, and lord Guilford, but without any intention for the pre&s;ent of putting it in execution.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="173">Mary now entered London, and with very little effu&s;ion of blood, &s;aw her&s;elf joyfully proclaimed, and peaceably &s;ettled on the throne. This was a flattering pro&s;pect, but &s;oon this plea&s;ing phantom was di&s;&s;olved. Mary was moro&s;e, and a bigot; &s;he was re&s;olved to give back their former power to the cler|gy; and thus once more to involve the kingdom in all the horrors it had ju&s;t emerged from. Gardiner, Bonner, Ton&s;tal, Day, Heath and Ve&s;ey, who had been confined, or &s;uffered lo&s;&s;es for their catholic opinions, during the late reigns, were taken from pri&s;on, re|in&s;tated in their &s;ees, and their former &s;entences re|pealed.</P>
<P>A parliament, which the queen called &s;oon after, &s;eemed willing to concur in all her mea&s;ures; they at one blow repealed all the &s;tatutes with regard to re|ligion, which had pa&s;&s;ed during the reign of her pre|dece&s;&s;or: &s;o that the national religion was again placed on the &s;ame footing on which it &s;tood at the death of Henry the Eighth.</P>
<P>While religion was thus returning to its primitive abu&s;es, the queen's mini&s;ters, who were willing to &s;trengthen her power by a catholic alliance, had been for &s;ome time looking out for a proper con&s;ort: they pitched upon Philip, prince of Spain, and &s;on of the ce|lebrated Charles the Fifth. In order to avoid as much as po&s;&s;ible, any di&s;agreeable remon&s;trances from the people, the articles of marriage were drawn as favour|ably as po&s;&s;ible to the intere&s;ts and honour of Eng|land; and this in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;tilled the clamours that had already been begun again&s;t it.</P>
<P>The di&s;contents of the people, ro&s;e to &s;uch a pitch that an in&s;urrection, headed by Sir Thomas Wyat, &s;uc|ceeded; but Wyat being made pri&s;oner, was condem|ned and executed, with &s;ome of his adherents.</P>
<P>But what excited the compa&s;&s;ion of the people mo&s;t of all, was the execution of lady Jane Gray, and her hu&s;band lord Guilford Dudley, who were involved
<PB N="163" REF="174">
in the puni&s;hment though not in the guilt, of this in|&s;urrection. Two days after Wyat was apprehended, lady Jane and her hu&s;band were ordered to prepare for death. Lady Jane, who had long before &s;een the threatened blow, was no way &s;urprized at the me&s;&s;age, but bore it with heroic re&s;olution; and being inform|ed that &s;he had three days to prepare, &s;he &s;eemed di&s;|plea&s;ed at &s;o long a delay. On the day of her execu|tion her hu&s;band de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ee her; but this &s;he refu&s;ed, as &s;he knew the parting would be too tender for her fortitude to with&s;tand. The place at fir&s;t de&s;igned for their execution was without the Tower; but their youth, beauty, and innocence be|ing likely to rai&s;e an in&s;urrection among the people, orders were given that they &s;hould be executed with|in the verge of the Tower. Lord Dudley was the fir&s;t that &s;uffered; and while the lady Jane was con|ducting to the place of execution, the officers of the Tower met her, bearing along the headle&s;s body of her hu&s;band &s;treaming with blood, in order to be in|terred in the Tower-chapel. She looked on the corp&s;e for &s;ome time without any emotion; and then, with a &s;igh, de&s;ired them to proceed. On the &s;caf|fold &s;he made a &s;peech, in which &s;he alledged that her offence was not the having laid her hand upon the crown, but the not rejecting it with &s;ufficient con|&s;tancy; that &s;he had le&s;s erred through ambition than filial obedience; that &s;he willingly accepted death as the only atonement &s;he could make to the injured &s;tate; and was ready by her puni&s;hment to &s;hew, that innocence is no plea in excu&s;e for deeds that tend to injure the community. After &s;peaking to this effect, &s;he cau&s;ed her&s;elf to be di&s;robed by her women, and with a &s;teady &s;erene countenance &s;ubmit|ted to the executioner.</P>
<P>At the head of tho&s;e who drove the&s;e violent mea|&s;ures forward were Gardiner, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, and cardinal Pole, who was now returned from
<PB N="164" REF="175">
Italy. Pole, who was nearly allied by birth to the royal family, had always con&s;cientiou&s;ly adhered to the catholic religion, and had incurred Henry's di&s;|plea&s;ure, not only by refu&s;ing to a&s;&s;ent to his mea|&s;ures, but by writing again&s;t him. It was for this adherence that he was cheri&s;hed by the pope, and now &s;ent over to England as legate from the holy &s;ee. Gardiner was a man of a very different character; his chief aim was to plea&s;e the reigning prince, and he had &s;hewn already many in&s;tances of his prudent conformity.</P>
<P>A per&s;ecution therefore began by the martyrdom of Hooper, bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter, and Rogers, pre|bendary of St. Paul's. They were examined by com|mi&s;&s;ioners appointed by the queen, with the chan|cellor at the head of them.</P>
<P>Sanders and Taylor, two other clergymen, who&s;e zeal had been di&s;tingui&s;hed in carrying on the refor|mation, were the next that &s;uffered. Bonner, bi&s;hop of London, bloated at once with rage and luxury, let loo&s;e his vengeance without re&s;traint; and &s;eemed to take a plea&s;ure in the pains of the unhappy &s;ufferers; while the queen, by her letters, exhorted him to pur&s;ue the pious work without pity or interruption. Soon after, in obedience to her commands, Ridley, bi&s;hop of London; and the venerable Latimer, bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, were condemned together. Ridley had been one of the able&s;t champions for the refor|mation; his piety, learning, and &s;olidity of judg|ment, were admired by his friends, and dreaded by his enemies. The night before his execution, he in|vited the mayor of Oxford and his wife to &s;ee him; and when he beheld them melted into tears, he him|&s;elf appeared quite unmoved, inwardly &s;upported and comforted in that hour of agony. When he was brought to the &s;take to be burnt, he found his old friend Latimer there before him. Of all the prelates of that age, Latimer was the mo&s;t remark|able
<PB N="165" REF="176">
for his unaffected piety, and the &s;implicity of his manners. He had never learned to flatter in courts; and his open rebuke was dreaded by all the great, who at that time too much de&s;erved it. His &s;ermons, which remain to this day, &s;hew that he had much learning, and much wit; and there is an air of &s;in|cerity running through them, not to be found el&s;e|where. When Ridley began to comfort his ancient friend, Latimer, on his part, was as ready to return the kind office. "Be of good cheer, brother, cried he, we &s;hall this day kindle &s;uch a torch in England, as, I tru&s;t in God, &s;hall never be extingui&s;hed." A furious bigot a&s;cended to preach to them and the people, while the fire was preparing; and Ridley gave a mo&s;t &s;erious attention to his di&s;cour&s;e. No way di&s;tracted by the preparations about him, he heard him to the la&s;t; and then told him, that he was ready to an&s;wer all that he had preached upon, if he were permitted a &s;hort indulgence; but this was refu&s;ed him. At length fire was &s;et to the pile: Latimer was &s;oon out of pain, but Ridley continued to &s;uffer much longer, his legs being con&s;umed be|fore the fire reached his vitals.</P>
<P>Cranmer's death followed &s;oon after, and &s;truck the whole nation with horror. His love of life had formerly prevailed. In an unguarded moment he was induced to &s;ign a paper condemning the refor|mation; and now his enemies, as we are told of the devil, after having rendered him completely wretched, re&s;olved to de&s;troy him. Being led to the &s;take, and the fire beginning to be kindled round him, he &s;tretch|ed forth his right-hand, and held it in the flames till it was con&s;umed, while he frequently cried out, in the mid&s;t of his &s;ufferings, "That unworthy hand;" at the &s;ame time exhibiting no appearance of pain or di&s;order. When the fire attacked his body he &s;eem|ed to be quite in&s;en&s;ible of his tortures; his mind was occupied wholly upon the hopes of a future reward.
<PB N="166" REF="177">
After his body was de&s;troyed, his heart was &s;ound entire; an emblem of the con&s;tancy with which he &s;uffered.</P>
<P>It was computed, that during this per&s;ecution, two hundred and &s;eventy-&s;even per&s;ons &s;uffered by fire, be&s;ides tho&s;e puni&s;hed by impri&s;onment, fines, and con&s;i&s;cations. Among tho&s;e who &s;uffered by fire were five bi&s;hops, twenty one clergymen, eight lay gentlemen, eighty-four trade&s;men, one hundred hu&s;bandmen, fifty-five women, and four children. All this was terrible; and yet the temporal affairs of the kingdom did not &s;eem to be more &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1557.</NOTE>Calais, that had now for above two hundred years been in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h, was attacked, and by a &s;udden and unexpect|ed a&s;&s;ault being blocked up on every &s;ide, was obliged to capitulate; &s;o that in le&s;s than eight days, the duke of Gui&s;e recovered a city that had been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h &s;ince the time of Edward the Third, and which he had &s;pent eleven months in be&s;ieging. This lo&s;s filled the whole kingdom with murmurs, and the queen with de&s;pair; &s;he was heard to &s;ay, that when dead, the name of Calais would be found engraven on her heart.</P>
<P>The&s;e complicated evils, a murmuring people, an encrea&s;ing here&s;y, a di&s;dainful hu&s;band, and an un|&s;ucce&s;sful war, made dreadful depredations on Mary's con&s;titution. She began to appear con&s;umptive, and this rendered her mind &s;till more moro&s;e and bigotted. The people now therefore began to turn their thoughts to her &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and the prince&s;s Elizabeth came into a greater degree of con&s;ideration than before.</P>
<P>Mary had been long in a very declining &s;tate of health; and having mi&s;taken her drop&s;y for a preg|nancy, &s;he made u&s;e of an improper regimen, which had encrea&s;ed the di&s;order. Every reflection now tormented her. The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of being hated by her &s;ubjects, and the pro&s;pect of Elizabeth's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="167" REF="178">
whom &s;he hated; all the&s;e preyed upon her mind, and threw her into a lingering fever, of which &s;he died, after a &s;hort and unfortunate reign of five years, four months, and eleven days, in the forty-third year of her age.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVI. ELIZABETH.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING could exceed the joy that was diffu&s;ed among the people upon the acce&s;&s;ion of Elizabeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1558.</NOTE> who now came to the throne without any oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>This favourite of the people, from the begining, re&s;olved upon reforming the church; even while &s;he was held in the con&s;traints of a pri&s;on; and now upon coming to the crown, &s;he immediately &s;et about it. A parliament &s;oon after completed what the prerogative had begun; act after act was pa&s;&s;ed in fa|vour of the reformation; and in a &s;ingle &s;e&s;&s;ion the form of religion was e&s;tabli&s;hed as we at pre&s;ent have the happine&s;s to enjoy it.</P>
<P>A &s;tate of permanent felicity is not to be expected here; and Mary Stuart, commonly called Mary queen of Scots, was the fir&s;t per&s;on that excited the fears or the re&s;entment of Elizabeth. Henry the &s;eventh had married his elde&s;t daughter, Margaret, to James, king of Scotland, who dying, left no i&s;&s;ue that came to maturity except Mary, afterwards &s;urnamed queen of Scots. At a very early age, this prince&s;s being po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of every accompli&s;hment of per&s;on and mind, was married to Francis, the dauphin of France, who dying left her a widow at the age of nineteen. Upon the death of Francis, Mary, the widow, &s;till &s;eemed di&s;|po&s;ed to keep up the title; but finding her&s;elf expo&s;ed
<PB N="168" REF="179">
to the per&s;ecutions of the dowager queen, who now began to take the lead in France, &s;he returned home to Scotland, where &s;he found the people &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with the gloomy enthu&s;ia&s;m of the times. A difference in religion between the &s;overeign and the people is ever productive of bad effects; &s;ince it is apt to produce contempt on the one &s;ide, and jealou&s;y on the other. Mary could not avoid regarding the &s;our manners of the reformed clergy, who now bore &s;way among the Scotch, without a mixture of ridicule and hatred; while they, on the other hand, could not look tamely on the gaieties and levities which &s;he introduced among them, without abhor|rence and re&s;entment. The jealou&s;y thus excited, began every day to grow &s;tronger; the clergy waited only for &s;ome indi&s;cretion in the queen to fly out into open oppo&s;ition; and her indi&s;cretion but too &s;oon gave them &s;ufficient opportunity.</P>
<P>Mary, upon her return, had married the earl of Darnley; but having been dazzled by the plea&s;ing exterior of her new lover, &s;he had entirely forgot to look to the accompli&s;hments of his mind. Darnley was but a weak and ignorant man; violent yet variable in his enterprizes; in&s;olent, yet credulous, and ea&s;ily governed by flatterers. She &s;oon therefore began to convert her admiration into di&s;gu&s;t; and Darnley, enraged at her encrea&s;ing coldne&s;s, pointed his ven|geance again&s;t every per&s;on he &s;uppo&s;ed the cau&s;e of this change in her &s;entiments and behaviour.</P>
<P>There was then in the court one David Rizzio, the &s;on of a mu&s;ician at Turin, him&s;elf a mu&s;ician, whom Mary took into her confidence. She con&s;ulted him on all occa&s;ions; no favours could be obtained but by his interce&s;&s;ion, and all &s;uitors were fir&s;t obliged to gain Rizzio to their intere&s;ts, by pre&s;ents, or by flattery. It was ea&s;y to per&s;uade a man of Darnley's jealous uxorious temper, that Rizzio was the per&s;on who had e&s;tranged the queen's affections
<PB N="169" REF="180">
from him; and a &s;urmi&s;e once conceived became to him a certainty. He &s;oon therefore con&s;ulted with &s;ome lords of his party, who accompanying him into the queens' apartment, where Rizzio then was, they dragged him into the anti-chamber, where he was di&s;patched with fifty-&s;ix wounds; the unhappy prince&s;s continuing her lamentations, while they were perpetrating their horrid intent. Being informed however of his fate, Mary at once dried her tears, and &s;aid &s;he would weep no more for &s;he would now think of revenge.</P>
<P>She therefore concealed her re&s;entment, and &s;o far impo&s;ed upon Darnley, her hu&s;band, that he put him&s;elf under her protection, and &s;oon after at|tended her to Edinburgh, where he was told the place would be favourable to his declining health. Mary lived in the palace of Holyrood-hou&s;e; but as the &s;ituation of that place was low, and the con|cour&s;e of per&s;ons about the court nece&s;&s;arily attend|ed with noi&s;e, which might di&s;turb him in his pre|&s;ent infirm &s;tate, &s;he fitted up an apartment for him in a &s;olitary hou&s;e at &s;ome di&s;tance, called the Kirk of Field. Mary there gave him marks of kindne&s;s and attachment; &s;he conver&s;ed cordially with him, and &s;he lay &s;ome nights in a room under him. It was on the ninth of February that &s;he told him &s;he would pa&s;s that night in the palace, becau&s;e the marriage of one of her &s;ervants was to be there celebrated in her pre&s;ence. But dreadful con&s;equences enfued. About two o'clock in the morning the whole city was much alarmed at hearing a great noi&s;e; the hou&s;e in which Darnley lay was blown up with gunpowder. His dead body was found at &s;ome di&s;tance in a neighbouring field, but without any marks of violence or contu&s;ion. No doubt could be enter|tained but that Darnley was murdered; and the general &s;u&s;picion fell upon Bothwell, a per&s;on lately taken into Mary's favour, as the perpetrator.</P>
<P>One crime led on to another; Bothwell, though accu&s;ed of being &s;tained with the hu&s;band's blood,
<PB N="170" REF="181">
though univer&s;ally odious to the people, had the confidence, while Mary was on her way to Stirling, on a vi&s;it to her &s;on, to &s;eize her at the head of a body of eight hundred hor&s;e, and to carry her to Dunbar, where he forced her to yield to his purpo&s;es. It was then thought by the people that the mea&s;ure of his crimes was complete; and that he who was &s;uppo&s;ed to kill the queen's hu&s;band, and to have of|fered violence to her per&s;on, could expect no mercy; but they were a&s;toni&s;hed upon finding, in&s;tead of di&s;grace, that Bothwell was taken into more than former favour; and, to crown all, that he was mar|ried to Mary, having divorced his own wife to pro|cure this union.</P>
<P>This was a fatal alliance to Mary; and the people were now wound up by the complication of her guilt, to pay very little deference to her authority. An a&s;&s;ociation was formed that took Mary pri&s;oner, and &s;ent her into confinement to the ca&s;tle of Lochlevin, &s;ituated in a lake of that name, where &s;he &s;uffered all the &s;everities of an unkind keeper, and an up|braiding con&s;cience, with a feeling heart.</P>
<P>The calamities of the great, even though ju&s;tly de&s;erved, &s;eldom fail of creating pity, and procuring friends. Mary, by her charms and promi&s;es, had engaged a young gentleman, who&s;e name was George Douglas, to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in e&s;caping from the place where &s;he was confined: and this he effected, by conveying her in di&s;gui&s;e in a &s;mall boat rowed by him&s;elf, a-&s;hore. It was now that the news of her enlargement being &s;pread abroad, all the loyalty of the people &s;eemed to revive once more, and in a few days &s;he &s;aw her&s;elf at the head of &s;ix thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>A battle was fought at Lang&s;ide, near Gla&s;gow, which was entirely deci&s;ive again&s;t her, and now being totally ruined, &s;he fled &s;outhwards from the field of
<PB N="171" REF="182">
battle with great precipitation;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1568.</NOTE> and came with a few attendants to the borders of England, where &s;he hoped for protection from Elizabeth, who in&s;tead of protecting, ordered her to be put in confinement, yet treated her with all proper marks of re&s;pect.</P>
<P>She was accordingly &s;ent to Tutbury ca&s;tle, in the county of Stafford, where &s;he was put under the cu&s;tody of the earl of Shrew&s;bury; where &s;he had hopes given her of one day coming into favour, and that unle&s;s her own ob&s;tinacy prevented, an ac|commodation might at la&s;t take place.</P>
<P>The duke of Norfolk was the only peer who en|joyed that highe&s;t title of nobility in England; and the qualities of his mind corre&s;ponded to his high &s;tation. Beneficent, affable, and generous, he had acquired the affections of the people; and yet from his moderation, he had never alarmed the jealou&s;y of the &s;overeign. He was at this time a widower, and being of a &s;uitable age to e&s;pou&s;e the queen of Scots, her own attractions, as well as his intere&s;ts, made him de&s;irous of the match. Elizabeth however dreaded &s;uch an union, and the duke was &s;oon after made pri&s;oner and &s;ent to the Tower. Upon his relea&s;ement from thence new projects were &s;et on foot by the enemies of the queen and the reformed religion, &s;ecretly fomented by Rodol|phi, an in&s;trument of the court of Rome, and the bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s, Mary's mini&s;ter in England. It was concerted by them, that Norfolk &s;hould renew his de|&s;igns upon Mary, and rai&s;e her to the throne, to which it is probablebe was prompted by pa&s;&s;ion as well as in|tere&s;t; and this nobleman entering into their &s;chemes, he from being at fir&s;t only ambitious, now became criminal. His &s;ervants were brought to make a full confe&s;&s;ion of their ma&s;ter's guilt; and the bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s &s;oon after, finding the whole di&s;covered, did not &s;cruple to confirm their te&s;timony. The duke
<PB N="172" REF="183">
was in&s;tantly committed to the Tower, and ordered to prepare for his trial. A jury of twenty-five peers unanimou&s;ly pa&s;&s;ed &s;entence upon him; and the queen four months after, reluctantly &s;igned the warrant for his execution. He died with great calmne&s;s and con&s;tancy; and though he cleared him&s;elf of any di&s;|loyal intentions again&s;t the queen's authority, he ac|knowledged the ju&s;tice of the &s;entence by which he &s;uffered.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;piracies &s;erved to prepare the way for Mary's ruin, who&s;e greate&s;t misfortunes proceeded rather from the violence of her friends, than the ma|lignity of her enemies. Elizabeth's mini&s;ters had long been waiting for &s;ome &s;ignal in&s;tance of the cap|tive queen's enmity, which they could ea&s;ily con|vert into trea&s;on; and this was not long wanting. About this time one John Ballard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1586.</NOTE> a popi&s;h prie&s;t, who had been bred in the Engli&s;h &s;eminary at Rheims, re&s;olved to compa&s;s the death of a queen, whom he con&s;idered as the enemy of his religion; and with that gloomy re&s;olution came over into England in the di&s;gui&s;e of a &s;oldier, with the a&s;&s;umed name of captain Forte&s;cue. He bent his endeavours to bring about at once the project of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, an in&s;urrection, and an inva&s;ion. The fir&s;t per&s;on he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to was Anthony Babington, of Dethick, in the county of Derby, a young gentleman of good family, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a very plentiful fortune. This per&s;on had been long remarkable for his zeal in the catholic cau&s;e, and in particular for his attachment to the cap|tive queen. He therefore came readily into the plot, and procured the concurrence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome other a&s;&s;ociates in this dangerous undertaking. The next &s;tep was to apprize Mary of the con&s;piracy formed in her favour, and this they effected by onveying their letters to her by means of a brewer that &s;upplied the family with ale, through a chink in the wall of her apart|ment.
<PB N="173" REF="184">
In the&s;e Babington informed her of a de&s;ign laid for a foreign inva&s;ion, the plan of an in&s;urrection at home, the &s;cheme for her delivery, and the con|&s;piracy for a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating the u&s;urper by &s;ix noble gen|tlemen, as he termed them, all of them his private friends, who, from the zeal which they bore the catho|lic cau&s;e, and her maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, would under|take the tragical execution. To the&s;e Mary replied, that &s;he approved highly of the de&s;ign; that the gentlemen might expect all the rewards which it &s;hould be ever in her power to confer; and that the death of Elizabeth was a nece&s;&s;ary circum&s;tance, previous to any further attempts, either for her delivery, or the intended in&s;urrection.</P>
<P>The plot being thus ripe for execution, and the evidence again&s;t the con&s;pirators inconte&s;tible, Wal|&s;ingham, who was privately informed of all, re&s;olved to &s;u&s;pend their puni&s;hment no longer. A warrant was accordingly i&s;&s;ued out for the apprehending of Babington, and the re&s;t of the con&s;pirators, who co|vered them&s;elves with various di&s;gui&s;es, and endea|voured to keep them&s;elves concealed. But they were &s;oon di&s;covered, thrown into pri&s;on, and brought to trial. In their examination they contradicted each other, and the leaders were obliged to make a full confe&s;&s;ion of the truth. Fourteen were condemned and executed, &s;even of whom died acknowledging their crime.</P>
<P>The execution of the&s;e wretched men only pre|pared the way for one of &s;till greater importance, in which a captive queen was to &s;ubmit to the unju&s;t de|ci&s;ions of tho&s;e who had no right, but that of power, to condemn her.</P>
<P>Accordingly a commi&s;&s;ion was i&s;&s;ued to forty peers, with five judges, or the major part of them, to try and pa&s;s &s;entence upon Mary, daughter and heir of James the Fifth, king of Scotland, commonly cal|led queen of Scots, and dowager of France.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="185"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 11, 1586.</NOTE>Thirty-&s;ix of the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners arriving at the ca&s;tle of Fotheringay, pre&s;ented her with a letter from Elizabeth, commanding her to &s;ubmit to a trial for her late con|&s;piracy. The principal charge again&s;t her was urged by &s;erjeant Gaudy, who accu&s;ed her with knowing, approving, and con&s;enting to Babington's con&s;piracy. This charge was &s;upported by Babington's confe&s;&s;ion, and by the copies which were taken of their corre&s;pon|dence, in which her approbation of the queen's murd|er was expre&s;sly declared.</P>
<P>Whatever might have been this queen's offences, it is certain that her treatment was very &s;evere. She de&s;ired to be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch notes as &s;he had taken preparative to her trial; but this was re|fu&s;ed her. She demanded a copy of her prote&s;t; but her reque&s;t was not complied with; &s;he even re|quired an advocate to plead her cau&s;e again&s;t &s;o many learned lawyers, as had undertaken to urge her ac|cu&s;ations, but all her demands were rejected; and, after an adjournment of &s;ome days, &s;entence of death was pronounced again&s;t her in the Star-chamber in We&s;tmin&s;ter, all the commi&s;&s;ioners, except two, be|ing pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Whether Elizabeth was really &s;incere in her ap|parent reluctance to execute Mary, is a que&s;tion which, though u&s;ually given again&s;t her, I will not take upon me to determine. Certainly there were great arts u&s;ed by her courtiers to determine her to the &s;ide of &s;everity; as they had every thing to fear from the re&s;entment of Mary, in ca&s;e &s;he ever &s;ucceeded to the throne. Accordingly, the kingdom was now filled with rumours of plots, trea&s;ons, and in&s;urrections; and the queen was continually kept in alarm by &s;ic|titious dangers. She, therefore, appeared to be in great terror and perplexity; &s;he was ob&s;erved to &s;it much alone, and to mutter to her&s;elf half &s;entences, importing the difficulty and di&s;tre&s;s to which &s;he was
<PB N="175" REF="186">
reduced. In this &s;ituation, &s;he one day called her &s;ecretary, Davi&s;on, whom &s;he ordered to draw out &s;ecretly the warrant for Mary's execution, informing him, that &s;he intended to keep it by her in ca&s;e any attempt &s;hould be made for the delivery of that prin|ce&s;s. She &s;igned the warrant, and then commanded it to be carried to the chancellor to have the &s;eal af|fixed to it. Next morning, however, &s;he &s;ent two gentlemen &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to de&s;ire that Davi&s;on would not go to the chancellor, until &s;he &s;hould &s;ee him, but Davi&s;on telling her that the warrant had been already &s;ealed, &s;he &s;eemed di&s;plea&s;ed at his precipita|tion. Davi&s;on, who probably wi&s;hed him&s;elf to &s;ee the &s;entence executed, laid the affair before the coun|cil, who unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved, that the warrant &s;hould be immediately put in execution, and promi&s;ed to ju&s;tify Davi&s;on to the queen. Accordingly, the fa|tal in&s;trument was delivered to Beale, who &s;ummon|ed the noblemen to whom it was directed, namely, the earls of Shrew&s;bury, Derby, Kent, and Cum|berland, and the&s;e together &s;et out for Fotheringay ca&s;tle, accompanied by two executioners, to di&s;patch their bloody commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mary heard of the arrival of her executioners, who ordered her to prepare for death by eight o'clock the next morning.</P>
<P>Early on the fatal morning &s;he dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf in a rich habit of &s;ilk and velvet, the only one which &s;he had re&s;erved for this &s;olemn occa&s;ion. Thomas Andrews, the under-&s;heriff of the county, then en|tering the room, he informed her that the hour was come, and that he mu&s;t attend her to the place of execution. She replied, that &s;he was ready; and bidding her &s;ervants farewell, &s;he proceeded, &s;up|ported by two of her guards, and followed the &s;heriff, with a &s;erene compo&s;ed a&s;pect, with a long veil of linen on her head, and in her hand a crucifix of ivory.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="187">She then pa&s;&s;ed into another hall, the noblemen and the &s;heriff going before, and Melvil, her ma&s;ter of the hou&s;ehold, bearing up her train; where was a &s;caffold erected and covered with black. As &s;oon as &s;he was &s;eated, Beale began to read the warrant for her execution. Then Fletcher, dean of Peterbo|rough, &s;tanding without the rails, repeated a long exhortation, which &s;he de&s;ired him to forbear, as &s;he was firmly re&s;olved to die in the catholic religion. The room was crowded with &s;pectators, who beheld her with pity and di&s;tre&s;s, while her beauty, though dimmed by age and affliction, gleamed through her &s;ufferings, and was &s;till remarkable in this fatal mo|ment. The two executioners kneeling, and a&s;king her pardon, &s;he &s;aid &s;he forgave them, and all the authors of her death, as freely as &s;he hoped forgive|ne&s;s from her Maker, and then once more made a &s;olemn prote&s;tation of her innocence. Her eyes were then covered with a linen handkerchief; and &s;he laid her&s;elf down without any fear or trepidation. Then reciting a p&s;alm, and repeating a pious ejaculation, her head was &s;evered from her body at two &s;trokes by the executioner. In contemplating the conten|tions of mankind, we find almo&s;t ever both &s;ides culpable; Mary, who was &s;tained with crimes that de&s;erved puni&s;hment, was put to death by a prince&s;s who had no ju&s;t preten&s;ions to inflict puni&s;hment on her equal.</P>
<P>In the mean time Philip, king of Spain, who had long meditated the de&s;truction of England, and who&s;e exten&s;ive power gave him grounds to hope for &s;ucce&s;s, now began to put his projects into execu|tion. The point on which he re&s;ted his glory, and the perpetual object of his &s;chemes, was to &s;upport the catholic religion, and exterminate the reforma|tion. The revolt of his &s;ubjects in the Netherlands &s;till more enflamed his re&s;entment again&s;t the Eng|li&s;h, as they had encouraged that in&s;urrection, and
<PB N="177" REF="188">
a&s;&s;i&s;ted the revolters. He had, therefore, for &s;ome time been making preparations to attack England by a powerful inva&s;ion; and now every part of his va&s;t empire re&s;ounded with the noi&s;e of armaments, and every art was u&s;ed to levy &s;upplies for that great de|&s;ign The marquis of Santa Croce, a &s;ea officer of great reputation and experience, was de&s;tined to command the fleet, which con&s;i&s;ted of an hundred and thirty ve&s;&s;els, of a greater &s;ize than any that had been hitherto &s;een in Europe. The duke of Parma was to conduct the land forces, twenty thou&s;and of whom were on board the fleet, and thirty-four thou|&s;and more were a&s;&s;embled in the Netherlands, ready to be tran&s;ported into England; no doubt was enter|tained of this fleet's &s;ucce&s;s, and it was oftentatiou&s;ly &s;tyled the Invincible Armada.</P>
<P>Nothing could exceed the terror and con&s;ternation which all ranks of people felt in England upon news of this terrible Armada being under &s;ail to invade them.&mdash;A fleet of not above thirty &s;hips of war, and tho&s;e very &s;mall, in compari&s;on, was all that was to oppo&s;e it by &s;ea; and as for re&s;i&s;ting by land, that was &s;uppo&s;ed to be impo&s;&s;ible, as the Spani&s;h army was compo&s;ed of men well di&s;ciplined, and long en|ured to danger.</P>
<P>Although the Engli&s;h fleet was much inferior in number and &s;ize of &s;hipping to that of the enemy, yet it was much more manageable, the dexterity and courage of the mariners being greatly &s;uperior. Lord Howard of E&s;&s;ingham, a man of great courage and capacity, as lord Admiral, took on him the com|mand of the navy. Drake, Hawkins, and Frobi|&s;her, the mo&s;t renowned &s;eamen in Europe, &s;erved under him; while a &s;mall &s;quadron con&s;i&s;ting of forty ve&s;&s;els, Engli&s;h and Flemi&s;h, commanded by lord Seymour, lay off Dunkirk, in order to inter|cept the duke of Parma. This was the preparation made by the Engli&s;h, while all the prote&s;tant powers
<PB N="178" REF="189">
of Europe regarded this enterprize as the critical event which was to decide for ever the fate of their religion.</P>
<P>In the mean time, while the Spani&s;h Armada was pre|paring to &s;ail, the admiral Santa Croce died, as likewi&s;e the vice admiral Paliano; and the command of the ex|pedition was given to the duke de Medina Sidonia, a per&s;on utterly unexperienced in &s;ea affairs; and this, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;erved to fru&s;trate the de&s;ign. But &s;ome other accidents al&s;o contributed to its fai|lure. Upon leaving the port of Li&s;bon, the Arma|da next day met with a violent tempe&s;t, which &s;unk &s;ome of the &s;malle&s;t of their &s;hipping, and obliged the fleet to put back into harbour. After &s;ome time &s;pent in refitting, they again put to &s;ea; where they took a fi&s;herman, who gave them intelligence that the Engli&s;h fleet, hearing of the di&s;per&s;ion of the Armada in a &s;torm, was retired back into Plymouth harbour, and mo&s;t of the mariners di&s;charged. From this fal&s;e intelligence, the Spani&s;h admiral, in&s;tead of going directly to the coa&s;t of Flanders, to take in the troops &s;tationed there, as he had been in&s;tructed, re&s;olved to &s;ail to Plymouth, and de&s;troy the &s;hipping laid up in that harbour. But Effingham the Engli&s;h admiral, was very well prepared to receive them; he was ju&s;t got out of port when he &s;aw the Spani&s;h Armada coming full &s;ail towards him, di&s;po&s;ed in the form of an half moon, and &s;tretching &s;even miles from one extremity to the other. However, the Eng|li&s;h admiral, &s;econded by Drake, Hawkins, and Fro|bi&s;her, attacked the Armada at a di&s;tance, pouring in their broad&s;ides with admirable dexterity. They did not chu&s;e to engage the enemy more clo&s;ely, becau&s;e they were greatly inferior in the num|ber of &s;hips, guns, and weight of metal; nor could they pretend to board &s;uch lofty &s;hips with|out manife&s;t di&s;advantage. However, two Spa|ni&s;h galleons were di&s;abled and taken. As the
<PB N="179" REF="190">
Armada advanced up the Channel, the Engli&s;h &s;till followed and infe&s;ted their rear; and their fleet con|tinually encrea&s;ing from different ports, they &s;oon found them&s;elves in a capacity to attack the Spani&s;h fleet more nearly; and accordingly fell upon them, while they were as yet taking &s;helter in the port of Calais. To encrea&s;e their confu&s;ion, Howard took eight of his &s;maller &s;hips, and filling them with com|bu&s;tible materials, &s;ent them, as if they had been fire &s;hips, one after the other into the mid&s;t of the enemy. The Spaniards, taking them for what they &s;eemed to be, immediately took flight in great di&s;|order; while the Engli&s;h, profiting by their panic, took or de&s;troyed about twelve of the enemy.</P>
<P>This was a fatal blow to Spain; the duke de Me|dina Sidonia being thus driven to the coa&s;t of Zea|land, held a council of war, in which it was re&s;olv|ed, that as their ammunition began to fail, as their &s;hips had received great damage, and the duke of Parma had refu&s;ed to venture his army under their protection, they &s;hould return to Spain by &s;ailing round the Orkneys, as the winds were contrary to his pa&s;&s;age directly back. Accordingly they pro|ceeded northward, and were followed by the Eng|li&s;h fleet as far as Flamborough-head, where they were terribly &s;hattered by a &s;torm. Seventeen of the &s;hips, having five thou&s;and men on board, were af|terwards ca&s;t away upon the we&s;tern i&s;les, and the coa&s;t of Ireland. Of the whole Armada, three and fifty &s;hips only returned to Spain, in a mi&s;erable condition; and the &s;eamen as well as &s;oldiers who remained, only &s;erved, by their accounts, to intimi|date their countrymen from attempting to renew &s;o dangerous an expedition.</P>
<P>From being invaded, the Engli&s;h in their turn, attacked the Spaniards. Of tho&s;e who made the mo&s;t &s;ignal figure in the depredations upon Spain, was the young earl of E&s;&s;ex, a nobleman of great bravery, genero&s;ity, and genius; and fitted, not only for the foremo&s;t ranks
<PB N="180" REF="191">
in war by his valour, but to conduct the intrigues of a court by his eloquence and addre&s;s. In all the ma&s;ques which were then performed, the earl and Elizabeth were generally coupled as partners; and although &s;he was almo&s;t &s;ixty, and he not half &s;o old, yet her vanity overlooked the di&s;parity; the world told her that &s;he was young, and &s;he her&s;elf was willing to think &s;o. This young earl's intere&s;t in the queen's affections, as may naturally be &s;up|po&s;ed, promoted his intere&s;ts in the &s;tate; and he conducted all things at his di&s;cretion. But young and unexperienced as he was, he at length began to fancy that the popularity he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and the flatte|ries he received, were given to his merits, and not to his favour. In a debate before the queen, be|tween him and Burleigh, about the choice of a go|vernor for Ireland, he was &s;o heated in the argu|ment, that he entirely forgot both the rules and du|ties of civility. He turned his back on the queen in a contemptuous manner, which &s;o provoked her re&s;entment, that &s;he in&s;tantly gave him a box on the ear. In&s;tead of recollecting him&s;elf, and making the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions due to her &s;ex and &s;tation, he clapped his hand to his &s;word; and &s;wore he would not bear &s;uch u&s;age even from her father. This offence, tho' very great, was overlooked by the queen; her par|tiality was &s;o prevalent, that &s;he re-in&s;tated him in her former favour, and her kindne&s;s &s;eemed to have acquired new force from that &s;hort interruption of anger and re&s;entment. The death al&s;o of his rival, lord Burleigh, which happened &s;hortly after, &s;eemed to confirm his power. At that time the earl of Ty|rone headed the rebellious natives of Ireland; who, not yet thoroughly brought into &s;ubjection to the Engli&s;h, took every opportunity to make incur&s;ions upon the more civilized inhabitants, and &s;lew all they were able to overpower. To &s;ubdue the&s;e was an employment that E&s;&s;ex thought worthy of his
<PB N="181" REF="192">
ambition; nor were his enemies di&s;plea&s;ed at thus removing a man from court, where he ob&s;tructed all their private aims of preferment. But it ended in his ruin.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of attacking the enemy in their grand re|treat in Ul&s;ter, he led his forces into the province of Mun&s;ter, where he only exhau&s;ted his &s;trength, and lo&s;t his opportunity again&s;t a people that &s;ubmitted at his approach, but took up arms again when he re|tired. This i&s;&s;ue of an enterprize, from which much was expected, did not fail to provoke the queen mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly; and her anger was &s;till more heightened by the peevi&s;h and impatient letters, which he daily wrote to her and the council. But her re&s;entment again&s;t him was &s;till more ju&s;tly let loo&s;e, when &s;he found, that leaving the place of his appointment, and without any permi&s;&s;ion demanded or obtained, he had returned from Ireland to make his complaints to her&s;elf in per&s;on.</P>
<P>Tho' Elizabeth was ju&s;tly offended,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1600.</NOTE> yet he &s;oon won upon her temper to pardon him. He was ordered to continue a pri&s;oner in his own hou&s;e till the queen's further plea&s;ure &s;hould be known, and it is probable that the di&s;cretion of a few months might have rein&s;tated him in all his former em|ployments; but the impetuo&s;ity of his character would not &s;uffer him to wait for a &s;low redre&s;s of what he con&s;idered as wrongs; and the queen's refu&s;ing his reque&s;t to continue him in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a lucra|tive monopoly of &s;weet wines, which he had long enjoyed, &s;purred him on to the mo&s;t violent and guilty mea&s;ures. Having long built with fond cre|dulity on his great popularity, he began to hope, from the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the giddy multitude, that re|venge upon his enemies in the council, which he &s;uppo&s;ed was denied him from the throne. His greate&s;t dependence was upon the profe&s;&s;ions of the citizens of London, who&s;e &s;chemes of religion and
<PB N="182" REF="193">
government he appeared entirely to approve; and while he gratified the Puritans by railing at the go|vernment of the church, he plea&s;ed the envious, by expo&s;ing the faults of tho&s;e in power. Among other criminal projects, the re&s;ult of blind rage and de&s;|pair, it was re&s;olved, that Sir Chri&s;topher Blount, one of his creatures, &s;hould, with a choice detach|ment, po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of the palace gates; that Sir John Davis &s;hould &s;eize the hall, Sir Charles Davers the guard-chamber, while E&s;&s;ex him&s;elf &s;hould ru&s;h in from the Meu&s;e, attended by a body of his parti|zans, into the queen's pre&s;ence, entreat her to remove his and her enemies, to a&s;&s;emble a new parliament, and to correct the defects of the pre&s;ent admini&s;tra|tion.</P>
<P>While E&s;&s;ex was deliberating upon the manner he &s;hould proceed, he received a private note, by which he was warned to provide for his own &s;afety. He now, therefore, con&s;ulted with his friends touching the emergency of their &s;ituation; they were de&s;titute of arms and ammunition, while the guards at the palace were doubled, &s;o that any attack there would be fruitle&s;s. While he and his confidants were in con&s;ultation, a per&s;on, probably employed by his enemies, came in as a me&s;&s;enger from the citizens, with tenders of friend&s;hip and a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t all his adver&s;aries. Wild as the project was of rai&s;ing the city, in the pre&s;ent terrible conjuncture it was re&s;olved on, but the execution of it was delayed till the day following.</P>
<P>Early in the morning of the next day, he was at|tended by his friends, the earls of Rutland and Southampton, the lords Sandes, Parker, and Mount|eagle, with three hundred per&s;ons of di&s;tinction. The doors of E&s;&s;ex-hou&s;e were immediately locked, to prevent all &s;trangers from entering; and the earl now di&s;covered his &s;cheme for rai&s;ing the city more fully to all the con&s;pirators. In the mean time, Sir
<PB N="183" REF="194">
Walter Raleigh &s;ending a me&s;&s;age to Sir Ferdinando Gorges, this officer had a conference with him in a boat on the Thames, and there di&s;covered all their proceedings. The earl of E&s;&s;ex, who now &s;aw that all was to be hazarded, re&s;olved to leave his hou&s;e, and to &s;ally forth to make an in&s;urrection in the city. But he had made a very wrong e&s;timate in expecting that popularity alone could aid him in time of dan|ger; he i&s;&s;ued out with about two hundred follow|ers, armed only with &s;words; and in his pa&s;&s;age to the city was joined by the earl of Bedford and lord Cromwell. As he pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;treets, he cried aloud, For the queen! for the queen! a plot is laid for my life! hoping to engage the populace to ri&s;e; but they had received orders from the may|or to keep within their hou&s;es; &s;o that he was not joined by a &s;ingle per&s;on. In this manner, attended by a few of his followers, the re&s;t having privately retired, he made towards the river; and, taking a boat, arrived once more at E&s;&s;ex-hou&s;e, where he be|gan to make preparations for his defence. But his ca&s;e was too de&s;perate for any remedy from valour; wherefore, after demanding in vain for ho&s;tages, and conditions from his be&s;iegers, he &s;urrendered at di&s;|cretion, reque&s;ting only civil treatment, and a fair and impartial hearing.</P>
<P>E&s;&s;ex and Southampton were immediately carried to the archbi&s;hop's palace at Lambeth, from whence they were next day conveyed to the Tower, and tried by their peers on the nineteenth of February following. Little could be urged in their defence; their guilt was too flagrant, and though it de&s;erved pity it could not meet an acquittal. E&s;&s;ex after con|demnation was vi&s;ited by that religious horror which &s;eemed to attend him in all his di&s;graces. He was terrified almo&s;t to de&s;pair by the gho&s;tly remon&s;tran|ces of his own chaplain, he was reconciled to his enemies, and made a full confe&s;&s;ion of his con&s;pira|cy.
<PB N="184" REF="195">
It is alledged upon this occa&s;ion, that he had &s;trong hopes of pardon, from the irre&s;olution which the queen &s;eemed to di&s;cover before &s;he &s;igned the warrant for his execution. She had given him for|merly a ring, which &s;he de&s;ired him to &s;end her in any emergency of this nature, and that it &s;hould pro|cure his &s;afety and protection. This ring was actu|ally &s;ent her by the counte&s;s of Nottingham, who, being a concealed enemy to the unfortunate earl, never delivered it; while Elizabeth was &s;ecretly fired at his ob&s;tinacy in making no applications for mercy and forgivene&s;s. The fact is, &s;he appeared her&s;elf as much an object of pity, as the unfortunate noble|man &s;he was induced to condemn. She &s;igned the warrant for his execution, &s;he countermanded it, &s;he again re&s;olved on his death, and again felt a new return of tenderne&s;s. At la&s;t &s;he gave her con&s;ent to his execution, and was never &s;een to enjoy one happy day more.</P>
<P>With the death of her favourite E&s;&s;ex, all Eliza|beth's plea&s;ures &s;eemed to expire; &s;he afterwards went through the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tate merely from habit, but her &s;atisfactions were no more. Her di|&s;tre&s;s was more than &s;ufficient to de&s;troy the remains of her con&s;titution; and her end was now vi&s;ibly &s;een to approach. Her voice &s;oon after left her; &s;he fell into a lethargic &s;lumber, which continued &s;ome hours, and &s;he expired gently without a groan, in the &s;eventieth year of her age, and the forty-fifth of her reign. Her character differed with her circum|&s;tances; in the beginning, &s;he was moderate and humble; towards the end of her reign, haughty and &s;evere. Though &s;he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of excellent &s;en&s;e, yet &s;he never had the di&s;cernment to di&s;cover that &s;he wanted beauty; and to flatter her charms at the age of &s;ixty-five, was the &s;ure&s;t road to her favour and e&s;teem.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="196">But whatever were her per&s;onal defects as a queen, &s;he is to be ever remembered by the Engli&s;h with gra|titude. It is true, indeed, that &s;he carried her prero|gative in parliament to its highe&s;t pitch; &s;o that it was tacitly allowed in that a&s;&s;embly, that &s;he was above all law, and could make and unmake them at her plea&s;ure; yet &s;till &s;he was &s;o wi&s;e and good, as &s;eldom to exert that power which &s;he claimed, and to enforce few acts of her prerogative, which were not for the benefit of her people. It is true, in like manner, that the Engli&s;h during her reign were put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of no new or &s;plendid acqui&s;itions; but commerce was daily growing up among them, and the people began to find that the theatre of their true&s;t conque&s;ts was to be on the bo&s;om of the ocean. A nation which hitherto had been the object of every inva&s;ion, and a prey to every plunderer, now a&s;&s;erted its &s;trength in turn, and became terrible to its invaders. The &s;uc|ce&s;sful voyages of the Spaniards and Portugue&s;e, be|gan to excite their emulation; and they &s;itted out &s;e|veral expeditions for di&s;covering a &s;horter pa&s;&s;age to the Ea&s;t-Indies. The famous Sir Walter Raleigh, without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from government, colonized New England, while internal commerce was making equal improvements; and many Flemings, per&s;ecu|ted in their native country, found, together with their arts and indu&s;try, an ea&s;y a&s;ylum in England. Thus the whole i&s;land &s;eemed as if rouzed from her long habits of barbarity; arts, commerce, and legi&s;lation began to acquire new &s;trength every day; and &s;uch was the &s;tate of learning at that time, that &s;ome &s;ix that period as the Augu&s;tan age of England. Sir Walter Raleigh and Hooker are con&s;idered as among the fir&s;t improvers of our language. Spen&s;er and Shake&s;peare are too well known as poets to be prai&s;ed here; but of all mankind Francis Bacon, lord Veru|lam, who flouri&s;hed in this reign, de&s;erves, as a philo|&s;opher, the highe&s;t applau&s;e; his &s;tyle is copious and
<PB N="186" REF="197">
correct, and his wit is only &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by his learning and penetration. If we look through hi&s;tory, and con&s;ider the ri&s;e of kingdoms, we &s;hall &s;carce find an in&s;tance of a people, becoming, in &s;o &s;hort a time, wi&s;e, powerful, and happy. Liberty, it is true, &s;till continued to fluctuate; Elizabeth knew her own power, and &s;tretched it to the very verge of de&s;po|ti&s;m; but now that commerce was introduced, liber|ty &s;oon after followed; for there never was a nation perfectly commercial, that &s;ubmitted long to &s;lavery.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVII. JAMES I.</HEAD>
<P>JAMES, the &s;ixth of Scotland and the fir&s;t of England, the &s;on of Mary, came to the throne with the univer&s;al approbation of all orders of the &s;tate, as in his per&s;on were united every claim that either de&s;cent, beque&s;t, or parliamentary &s;anction could confer. However, in the very beginning of his reign a con&s;piracy was &s;et on foot, the particulars of which are but ob&s;curely related. It is &s;aid to be be|gan by lord Grey, lord Cobham, and Sir Walter Ra|leigh, who were all condemned to die, but had their &s;entence mitigated by the king. Cobham and Grey were pardoned, after they had laid their heads on the block. Raleigh was reprieved, but remained in confinement many years afterwards, and at la&s;t &s;uf|fered for this offence, which was never proved.</P>
<P>Mild as this monarch was in toleration, there was a project contrived in the very beginning of his reign for there-e&s;tabli&s;hment of popery, which, were it not a fact known to all the world, could &s;carcely be credited by po&s;terity. This was the gun-powder plot, than which a more horrid or terrible &s;cheme never entered into the human heart to conceive.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="198">The Roman catholics had expected great favour and indulgence on the acce&s;&s;ion of James, both as a de&s;cendant of Mary, a rigid catholic, and al&s;o as ha|ving &s;hewn &s;ome partiality to that religion in his youth. But they &s;oon di&s;covered their mi&s;take; and were at once &s;urpri&s;ed and enraged to find James on all occa&s;ions expre&s;s his re&s;olution of &s;trictly exe|cuting the laws enacted again&s;t them, and of per&s;e|vering in the conduct of his predece&s;&s;or. This de|claration determined them upon more de&s;perate mea|&s;ures; and they at length formed a re&s;olution of de|&s;troying the king and both hou&s;es of parliament at a blow. The &s;cheme was fir&s;t broached by Robert Cate&s;by, a gentleman of good parts and ancient fami|ly, who conceived that a train of gun-powder might be &s;o placed under the parliament hou&s;e, as to blow up the king and all the members at once.</P>
<P>How horrid &s;oever the contrivance might appear, yet every member &s;eemed faithful and &s;ecret in the league; and about two months before the &s;itting of parliament, they hired a hou&s;e in Percy's name, ad|joing to that in which the parliament was to a&s;&s;emble. Their fir&s;t intention was to bore a way under the par|liament-hou&s;e, from that which they occupied, and they &s;et them&s;elves laboriou&s;ly to the ta&s;k; but when they had pierced the wall which was three yards in thickne&s;s, on approaching the other &s;ide, they were &s;urpri&s;ed to find that the hou&s;e was vaulted under|neath, and that a magazine of coals were u&s;ually de|po&s;ited there. From their di&s;appointment on this ac|count they were &s;oon relieved by information that the coals were then &s;elling off, and that the vaults would then be let to the highe&s;t bidder. They therefore &s;eized the opportunity of hiring the place, and bought the remaining quantity of coals with which it was then &s;tored, as if for their own u&s;e. The next thing done was to convey thither thirty-&s;ix barrels of gun-powder, which had been purcha&s;ed in Holland; and
<PB N="188" REF="199">
the whole was covered with the coals and with faggots brought for that purpo&s;e. Then the doors of the cellar were boldly flung open, and every body admit|ted, as if it contained nothing dangerous.</P>
<P>Confident of &s;ucce&s;s, they now began to plan the remaining part of their project. The king, the queen, and prince Henry, the king's elde&s;t &s;on, were all expected to be pre&s;ent at the opening of the parliament. The king's &s;econd &s;on, by rea&s;on of his tender age, would be ab&s;ent, and it was re&s;olv|ed that Percy &s;hould &s;eize, or a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him. The prince&s;s Elizabeth, a child likewi&s;e, was kept at lord Harrington's hou&s;e in Warwick&s;hire; and Sir Everard Digby was to &s;eize her, and immediately proclaim her queen.</P>
<P>The day for the &s;itting of parliament now ap|proached. Never was trea&s;on more &s;ecret, or ruin more apparently inevitable; the hour was expected with impatience, and the con&s;pirators gloried in their meditated guilt. The dreadful &s;ecret, though com|municated to above twenty per&s;ons, had been religi|ou&s;ly kept during the &s;pace of near a year and a half; when all the motives of pity, ju&s;tice, and &s;afety, were too weak, a remor&s;e of private friend&s;hip &s;aved the kingdom.</P>
<P>Sir Henry Percy, one of the con&s;pirators, conceiv|ed a de&s;ign of &s;aving the life of lord Mounteagle, his intimate friend and companion, who al&s;o was of the &s;ame per&s;ua&s;ion with him&s;elf. About ten days be|fore the meeting of parliament, this nobleman, upon his return to town, received a letter from a per&s;on unknown, and delivered by one who fled as &s;oon as he had di&s;charged his me&s;&s;age. The letter was to this effect, "My lord, &s;tay away from this parlia|ment; for God and man have concurred to puni&s;h the wickedne&s;s of the times. And think not &s;light|ly of this adverti&s;ement, but retire your&s;elf into your country, where you may expect the event in &s;afety.
<PB N="189" REF="200">
For though there be no appearance of any &s;tir, yet I &s;ay they will receive a terrible blow this parliament; and yet they &s;hall not &s;ee who hurts them. This council is not to be contemned, becau&s;e it may do you good, and can do you no harm. For the dan|ger is pa&s;t as &s;oon as you have burned the letter."</P>
<P>The contents of this my&s;terious letter &s;urprized and puzzled the nobleman to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed; and though inclined to think it a fooli&s;h attempt to affright and ridicule him, yet he judged it &s;afe&s;t to carry it to lord Sali&s;bury, &s;ecretary of &s;tate. Lord Sali&s;bury too was inclined to give little attention to it, yet thought proper to lay it before the king in council, who came to town a few days after. None of the council were able to make any thing of it, al|though it appeared &s;erious and alarming. In this uni|ver&s;al agitation between doubt and apprehen&s;ion, the king was the fir&s;t who penetrated the meaning of this dark epi&s;tle. He concluded that &s;ome &s;udden danger was preparing by gun-powder; and it was thought advi&s;eable to in&s;pect all the vaults below the hou&s;es of parliament. This care belonged to the earl of Suffolk, lord chamberlain, who purpo&s;ely delayed the &s;earch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 5. 1605.</NOTE> till the day before the meeting of par|liament. He remarked tho&s;e great piles of fag|gots which lay in the vault under the hou&s;e of Peers, and &s;eized a man preparing for the terrible en|terpri&s;e, dre&s;&s;ed in a cloak and boots, and a dark lan|thorn in his hand. This was no other than Guy Fawkes, who had ju&s;t di&s;po&s;ed every part of the train for its taking fire the next morning, the matches and other combu&s;tibles being found in his pockets. The whole of the de&s;ign was now di&s;covered; but the atrociou&s;ne&s;s of his guilt, and the de&s;pair of pardon, in&s;piring him with re&s;olution, he told the officers of ju&s;tice, with an undaunted air, that had he blown them and him|&s;elf up together he had been happy. Before the
<PB N="190" REF="201">
council, he di&s;played the &s;ame intrepid firmne&s;s, mixed even with &s;corn and di&s;dain, refu&s;ing to di&s;|cover his a&s;&s;ociates, and &s;hewing no concern but for the failure of his enterprize. But his bold &s;pirit was at length &s;ubdued; being confined to the Tower for two or three days, and the rack ju&s;t &s;hewn him, his courage, fatigued with &s;o long an effort, at la&s;t failed him, and he made a full di&s;covery of all his accom|plices.</P>
<P>Cate&s;by, Percy, and the con&s;pirators who were in London, hearing that Fawkes was arre&s;ted, fled with all &s;peed to Warwick&s;hire, where Sir Everard Digby, relying on the &s;ucce&s;s of the plot, was alrea|dy in arms. But the country &s;oon began to take the alarm, and wherever they turned, they found a &s;upe|rior force ready to oppo&s;e them. In this exigence, be&s;et on all &s;ides, they re&s;olved, to about the num|ber of eighty per&s;ons, to fly no farther, but make a &s;tand at an hou&s;e in Warwick&s;hire, to defend it to the la&s;t, and &s;ell their lives as dearly as po&s;&s;ible. But even this mi&s;erable con&s;olation was denied them: a &s;park of fire happening to fall among &s;ome gun-pow|der that was laid to dry, it blew up, and &s;o maimed the principal con&s;pirators, that the &s;urvivors re&s;olved to open the gate, and &s;ally out again&s;t the multi|tude that &s;urrounded the hou&s;e. Some were in&s;tantly cut to pieces; Cate&s;by, Percy, and Winter, &s;tanding back to back, fought long and de&s;perately, till in the end the two fir&s;t fell covered with wounds, and Winter was taken alive. Tho&s;e that &s;urvived the &s;laughter were tried and convicted; &s;everal fell by the hands of the executioner, and others experienced the king's mercy. The Je&s;uits, Garnet and Oldcorn, who were privy to the plot, &s;uffered with the re&s;t; and, notwith|&s;tanding the atrociou&s;ne&s;s of their trea&s;on, Garnet was con&s;idered by his party as a martyr, and miracles were &s;aid to have been wrought by his blood.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="202">The &s;agacity with which the king fir&s;t di&s;covered the plot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1612.</NOTE> rai&s;ed the opinion of his wi&s;dom among the people; the folly with which he gave him&s;elf up to his fa|vourites quickly undeceived the nation. In the fir&s;t rank of the&s;e &s;tood Robert Carre, a youth of a good family in Scotland, who, after having pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time in his travels, arrived in London, at about twenty years of age. All his natural accompli&s;hments con|&s;i&s;ted in a plea&s;ing vi&s;age; all his acquired abilities, in an ea&s;y and graceful demeanor. This youth was &s;oon con&s;idered as the mo&s;t ri&s;ing man at court; he was knighted, created vi&s;count Roche&s;ter, honoured with the order of the garter, made a privy-coun&s;ellor; and, to rai&s;e him to the highe&s;t pitch of honour, he was at la&s;t created earl of Somer&s;et.</P>
<P>This was an advancement which &s;ome regarded with envy; but the wi&s;er part of mankind looked upon it with contempt and ridicule, &s;en&s;ible that un|grounded attachments are &s;eldom of long continu|ance. Some time after being accu&s;ed and convicted from private motives of poi&s;oning Sir Thomas Over|bury in the Tower, he fell under the king's di&s;plea|&s;ure, and being driven from court, &s;pent the remain|der of his life in contempt and &s;elf-conviction.</P>
<P>But the king had not been &s;o improvident as to part with one favourite until he had provided him&s;elf with another. This was George Villiers, a youth of one and twenty, a younger brother of a good family, who was returned about that time from his travels, and whom the enemies of Somer&s;et had taken occa&s;ion to throw in the king's way, certain that his beauty and fa&s;hionable manners would do the re&s;t. Accordingly he had been placed at a comedy full in the king's view, and immediately caught the monarch's af|fections.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of a few years he created him vi&s;|count Villiers, earl, marquis, and duke of Bucking|ham,
<PB N="192" REF="203">
knight of the garter, ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e, chief ju&s;tice in eyre, warden of the cinque ports, ma&s;ter of the king's bench office, &s;teward of We&s;tmin&s;ter, con|&s;table of Wind&s;or, and lord high admiral of England.</P>
<P>The univer&s;al murmur which the&s;e fooli&s;h attach|ments produced, was &s;oon after heightened by an act of &s;everity, which &s;till continues as the blacke&s;t &s;tain upon this monarch's memory. The brave and learn|ed Raleigh had been confined in the Tower almo&s;t from the very beginning of James's acce&s;&s;ion, for a con&s;piracy which had never been proved again&s;t him; and in that abode of wretchedne&s;s he wrote &s;everal va|luable performances, which are &s;till in the highe&s;t e&s;|teem. His long &s;ufferings, and his ingenious wri|tings, had now turned the tide of popular opinion in his favour; and they who once dete&s;ted the enemy of E&s;&s;ex, could not now help pitying the long captivity of this philo&s;ophical &s;oldier. He him&s;elf &s;till &s;truggled for freedom; and perhaps it was with this de&s;ire that he &s;pread the report of his having di&s;covered a gold mine in Guiana, which was &s;ufficient to enrich, not only the adventurers who &s;hould &s;eize it, but afford immen&s;e trea&s;ures to the nation. The king, either believing his a&s;&s;ertions, or willing to &s;ubject him to further di&s;grace, granted him a commi&s;&s;ion to try his fortune in que&s;t of the&s;e golden &s;chemes; but &s;till re&s;erved his former &s;entence as a check upon his future behaviour.</P>
<P>Raleigh was not long in making preparations for this adventure, which, from the &s;anguine manner in which he carried it on, many believe he thought to be as promi&s;ing as he de&s;cribed it. He bent his cour&s;e to Guiana, and remaining him&s;elf at the mouth of the river Oroonoco, with five of the large&s;t &s;hips, he &s;ent the re&s;t up the &s;tream, under the command of his &s;on and of captain Keymis, a per&s;on entirely devoted to his intere&s;ts. But in&s;tead of a country abounding in gold, as the adventurers were taught
<PB N="193" REF="204">
to expect, they found the Spaniards had been warned of their approach, and were prepared in arms to re|ceive them. Young Raleigh, to encourage his men, called out that "This was the true mine," meaning the town of St. Thomas, which he was approaching; "and that none but fools looked for any other:" but ju&s;t as he was &s;peaking, he received a &s;hot, of which he immediately expired. This was followed by an|other di&s;appointment, for when the Engli&s;h took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town, they found nothing in it of any value.</P>
<P>Raleigh, in this forlorn &s;ituation, found now that all his hopes were over; but &s;aw his misfortunes &s;till farther aggravated by the reproaches of tho&s;e whom he had undertaken to command. Nothing could be more deplorable than his &s;ituation, particularly when he was told that he mu&s;t be carried back to England to an&s;wer for his conduct to the king. It is pretended that he employed many artifices, fir&s;t to engage them to attack the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements at a time of peace; and failing of that, to make his e&s;cape into France. But all the&s;e proving un&s;ucce&s;sful, he was delivered into the king's hands, and &s;trictly examined, as well as his fellow adventurers, before the privy-council. Count Gondemar, the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, made heavy complaints again&s;t the expedition; and the king de|clared that Raleigh had expre&s;s orders to avoid all di&s;putes and ho&s;tilities again&s;t the Spaniards. Where|fore, to give the court of Spain a particular in&s;tance of his attachment, he &s;igned the warrant for his ex|ecution, not for the pre&s;ent offence, but for his for|mer con&s;piracy. This great man died with the &s;ame fortitude that he had te&s;tified through life; he ob|&s;erved, as he felt the edge of the ax, that it was a &s;harp but a &s;ure remedy for all evils; his harangue to the people was calm and eloquent; and he laid his head down on the block with the utmo&s;t in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">if|ference.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="205">But there &s;oon appeared very apparent rea&s;ons for James's partiality to the court of Spain.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1618.</NOTE> This monarch had entertained an opinion which was peculiar to him|&s;elf, that in marrying his &s;on Charles, the prince of Wales, any alliance below that of royalty would be unworthy of him; he therefore was obliged to &s;eek, either in the court of France or Spain, a &s;uitable match, and he was taught to think of the lat|ter. Gondemar, who was amba&s;&s;ador from that court, perceiving this weak monarch's partiality to a crowned head, made an offer of the &s;econd daugh|ter of Spain to prince Charles; and that he might render the temptation irre&s;i&s;tible, he gave hopes of an immen&s;e fortune which &s;hould attend the prin|ce&s;s. However, this was a negotiation that was not likely &s;oon to be ended; and from the time the idea was fir&s;t &s;tarted, James &s;aw five years elap&s;ed without bringing the treaty to any kind of conclu|&s;ion.</P>
<P>A delay of this kind was very di&s;plea&s;ing to the king, who had all along an eye on the great fortune of the prince&s;s; nor was it le&s;s di&s;agreeable to prince Charles, who, bred up with ideas of romantic pa&s;&s;ion, was in love without ever &s;eeing the object of his af|fections. In this general tedium of delay, a project entered the head of Villiers, who had for &s;ome years ruled the king with ab&s;olute authority, that was fitter to be conceived by the knight of a romance, than by a mini&s;ter and a &s;tate&s;man. It was projected that the prince &s;hould him&s;elf travel in di&s;gui&s;e into Spain, and vi&s;it the prince&s;s of that country in per&s;on. Buck|ingham, who wanted to ingratiate him&s;elf with the prince, offered to be his companion; and the king, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to check &s;o wild a &s;cheme, gave his con&s;ent to this hopeful propo&s;al. Their adven|tures on this &s;trange project could fill novels; and have actually been made the &s;ubject of many. Charles
<PB N="195" REF="206">
was the knight-errant, and Buckingham was his '&s;quire. The match however broke off, for what rea&s;on hi&s;torians do not a&s;&s;ign; but if we may cre|dit the noveli&s;ts of that time, the prince had already fixed his affections upon the daughter of Henry IV. of France, whom he married &s;hortly after.</P>
<P>It may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed that the&s;e mi&s;manage|ments were &s;een and felt by the people. The hou&s;e of commons was by this time become quite unma|nageable; the prodigality of James to his favourites, had made his nece&s;&s;ities &s;o many, that he was con|tented to &s;ell the different branches of his preroga|tive to the commons, one after the other, to pro|cure &s;upplies. In proportion as they perceived his wants, they found out new grievances; and every grant of money was &s;ure to come with a petition for redre&s;s. The &s;truggles between him and his parlia|ment had been growing more and more violent every &s;e&s;&s;ion; and the very la&s;t advanced their preten&s;ions to &s;uch a degree, that he began to take the alarm; but the&s;e evils fell upon the &s;ucce&s;&s;or, which the weak|ne&s;s of this monarch had contributed to give birth to.</P>
<P>The&s;e dome&s;tic troubles were attended by others &s;till more important in Germany, and which pro|duced in the end the mo&s;t dangerous effects. The king's elde&s;t daughter had been married to Frederic, the elector Palatine of Germany, and this prince re|volting again&s;t the emperor Ferdinand the Second, was defeated in a deci&s;ive battle, and obliged to take refuge in Holland. His affinity to the Engli&s;h crown, his misfortunes, but particularly the prote&s;tant reli|gion, for which he had contended, were &s;trong mo|tives for the people of England to wi&s;h well to his cau&s;e; and frequent addre&s;&s;es were &s;ent from the commons to &s;pur up James to take a part in the German conte&s;t, and to replace the exiled prince upon the throne of his ance&s;tors. James at fir&s;t attempted
<PB N="196" REF="207">
to ward off the misfortunes of his &s;on-in-law by negotiations;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1620.</NOTE> but the&s;e proving ut|terly ineffectual, it was re&s;olved at la&s;t to re&s;cue the Palatinate from the emperor by force of arms. Accordingly war was declared a|gain&s;t Spain and the emperor; &s;ix thou&s;and men were &s;ent over into Holland, to a&s;&s;i&s;t prince Maurice in his &s;chemes again&s;t tho&s;e powers; the people were every where elated at the courage of their king, and were &s;atisfied with any war which was to exterminate the papi&s;ts. This army was followed by another con&s;i&s;ting of twelve thou&s;and men, commanded by count Mansfeldt; and the court of France promi&s;ed its a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But the Engli&s;h were di&s;appointed in all their views: the troops being embarked at Do|ver, upon &s;ailing to Calais, they found no orders for their admi&s;&s;ion. After waiting in vain for &s;ome time, they were obliged to &s;ail towards Zealand, where no proper mea&s;ures were yet con&s;ulted for their di&s;embarkation. Mean while, a pe&s;tilential di&s;|temper crept in among the forces, &s;o long cooped up in narrow ve&s;&s;els; half the army died while on board, and the other half, weakened by &s;ickne&s;s, appeared too &s;mall a body to march into the Palati|nate; and thus ended this ill-concerted and fruitle&s;s expedition.</P>
<P>Whether this misfortune had any effect upon James's con&s;titution is uncertain;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1625.</NOTE> but he was &s;oon after &s;eized with a tertian ague, which, when his courtiers a&s;&s;ured him from the proverb that it was health for a king, he replied, that the proverb was meant for a young king. After &s;ome &s;its he found him&s;elf extremely weakened, and &s;ent for the prince, whom he exhort|ed to per&s;evere in the prote&s;tant religion; then pre|paring with decency and courage to meet his end, he expired, after a reign over England of twenty-two years, and in the fifty-ninth year of his age.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVIII. CHARLES I.</HEAD>
<P>FEW princes ever a&s;cended a throne with more apparent advantages than Charles;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1625.</NOTE> and none ever encountered more real difficulties.</P>
<P>Indeed, he undertook the reins of government with a fixed per&s;ua&s;ion that his popularity was &s;ufficient to carry every mea&s;ure. He had been loaded with a treaty for defending the prince Palatine his brother-in-law in the late reign; and the war declared for that purpo&s;e was to be carried on with vigour in this. But war was more ea&s;ily declared than &s;up|plies granted. After &s;ome reluctance the commons voted him two &s;ub&s;idies; a &s;um far from being &s;uffi|cient to &s;upport him in his intended equipment.</P>
<P>To &s;upply the want of parliamentary aids, Charles had recour&s;e to &s;ome of the ancient methods of ex|tortion, practi&s;ed by &s;overeigns when in nece&s;&s;itous circum&s;tances. That kind of tax called a benevo|lence was ordered to be exacted, and privy &s;eals were i&s;&s;ued accordingly. With this the people were oblig|ed, though reluctantly, to comply; it was in fact authori&s;ed by many precedents; but no precedents what&s;oever could give a &s;anction to inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>After an ineffectual expedition to Cadiz, another attempt was made to obtain &s;upplies in a more re|gular and con&s;titutional manner than before. Ano|ther parliament was accordingly called; and though &s;ome &s;teps were taken to exclude the more popular leaders of the la&s;t hou&s;e of commons, by nominating them as &s;heriffs of counties, yet the pre&s;ent parlia|ment &s;eemed more refractory than the former. When the king laid before the hou&s;e his nece&s;&s;ities, and
<PB N="198" REF="209">
a&s;ked for a &s;upply, they voted him only three &s;ub&s;i|dies, which amounted to about an hundred and &s;ix|ty thou&s;and pounds; a &s;um no way adequate to the importance of the war, or the nece&s;&s;ities of the &s;tate. In order, therefore, to gain a &s;ufficient &s;upply, a commi&s;&s;ion was openly granted to compound with the catholics, and agree for a di&s;pen&s;ation of the pe|nal laws again&s;t them. He borrowed a &s;um of money from the nobility, who&s;e contributions came in but &s;lowly. But the greate&s;t &s;tretch of his power was in the levying of <HI>&s;hip-money.</HI> In order to equip a fleet (at lea&s;t this was the pretence made) each of the ma|ritime towns was required, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the adjacent counties, to arm as many ve&s;&s;els as were appointed them. The city of London was rated at twenty &s;hips. This was the commencement of a tax, which afterwards, being carried to &s;uch violent lengths, created &s;uch great di&s;contents in the na|tion.</P>
<P>War being &s;oon after declared again&s;t France, a fleet was &s;ent out, under the command of Bucking|ham, to relieve Rochelle, a maritime town in that kingdom, that had long enjoyed its privileges inde|pendent of the French king; but that had for &s;ome years embraced the reformed religion, and now was be&s;ieged with a formidable army. This expedition was as unfortunate as that to the coa&s;ts of Spain. The duke's mea&s;ures were &s;o ill concerted, that the inhabitants of the city &s;hut their gates, and refu&s;ed to admit allies, of who&s;e coming they were not pre|viou&s;ly informed. In&s;tead of attacking the i&s;land of Oleron, which was fertile and defencele&s;s, he bent his cour&s;e to the I&s;le of Rh&eacute;, which was garri&s;oned, and well fortified. He attempted there to &s;tarve out the garri&s;on of St. Martin's ca&s;tle, which was plen|tifully &s;upplied with provi&s;ions by &s;ea. By that time the French had landed their &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ces privately at ano|ther part of the i&s;land; &s;o that Buckingham was at
<PB N="199" REF="210">
la&s;t obliged to retreat, but with &s;uch precipitation, that two-thirds of his army were cut in pieces before he could reimbark, though he was the la&s;t man of the whole army that quitted the &s;hore. This proof of his per&s;onal courage, however, was but a &s;mall &s;ub|ject of con&s;olation for the di&s;grace which his country had &s;u&s;tained, for his own per&s;on would have been the la&s;t they would have regretted.</P>
<P>The conte&s;t between the king and the commons every day grew warmer. The officers of the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e were &s;ummoned before the commons, to give an account by what authority they &s;eized the goods of the merchants, who had refu&s;ed to pay the duty of tonnage and poundage, which they alledged was levied without the &s;anction of a law. The barons of the Exchequer were que&s;tioned concerning their de|crees on that head; and the &s;heriff of London was committed to the Tower for his activity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n &s;upporting the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers. The&s;e were bold mea|&s;ures; but the commons went &s;till farther, by a re|&s;olution to examine into religious grievances, and a new &s;pirit of intolerance began to appear.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1629.</NOTE> The king, therefore, re&s;olved to di&s;&s;olve a parliament, which he found him&s;elf unable to manage; and Sir John Finch, the &s;peak|er, ju&s;t as the que&s;tion concerning tonnage and poundage was going to be put, ro&s;e up, and inform|ed the hou&s;e that had a command from the king to adjourn.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e upon this was in an uproar; the &s;peak|er was pu&s;hed back into his chair, and forcibly held in it by Hollis and Valentine, till a &s;hort remon|&s;trance was framed, and pa&s;&s;ed by acclamation rather than vote. In this ha&s;ty production, Papi&s;ts and Ar|minians were declared capital enemies to the &s;tate. Tonnage and poundage was condemned as contrary to law; and not only tho&s;e who rai&s;ed that duty, but
<PB N="200" REF="211">
tho&s;e who paid it, were con&s;idered as guilty of capi|tal crimes</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this violent procedure, Sir Miles Hobart, Sir Peter Heyman, Selden, Coriton, Long, and Strode, were, by the king's order, committed to pri&s;on, under pretence of &s;edition. But the &s;ame temerity that impelled Charles to impri&s;on them, in|duced him to grant them a relea&s;e. Sir John Elliot, Hollis, and Valentine, were &s;ummoned before the King's Bench: but they refu&s;ing to appear before an inferior tribunal, for faults committed in a &s;uperior, they were condemned to be impri&s;oned during the king's plea&s;ure, to pay a fine, the two former of a thou&s;and pounds each, and the latter of five hundred, and to find &s;ureties for their good behaviour. The members triumphed in their &s;ufferings, while they had the whole kingdom as &s;pectators and applauders of their fortitude.</P>
<P>In the mean time, while the king was thus di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed by the ob&s;tinacy of the commons, he felt a much &s;everer blow in the death of his favourite, the duke of Buckingham, who fell a &s;acrifice to his unpopularity. It had been re&s;olved once more to undertake the rai&s;ing of the &s;iege of Rochelle; and the earl of Denbigh, brother-in-law to Buckingham, was &s;ent thither, but returned without effecting any thing. In order to repair this di&s;grace, the duke of Buckingham went in per&s;on to Port&s;mouth to hurry on another expedi|tion, and to puni&s;h &s;uch as had endeavoured to de|fraud the crown of the legal a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments. In the ge|neral di&s;content that prevailed again&s;t this nobleman, it was daily expected that &s;ome &s;evere mea&s;ures would be re&s;olved on; and he was &s;tigmatized as the tyrant and the betrayer of his country. There was one Felton, who caught the general con|tagion; an Iri&s;hman of a good family, who had &s;erv|ed under the duke as lieutenant, but had re&s;igned, on being refu&s;ed his rank on the death of his captain,

who had been killed at the I&s;le of Rh&eacute;. This man was naturally melancholy, courageous, and enthu|&s;ia&s;tic; he felt for his country, as if labouring under a calamity which he thought it in the power of his &s;ingle arm to remove.

While he was &s;peaking to one of his colonels, Felton &s;truck him over an officer's &s;houl|der in the brea&s;t with his knife. The duke had only time to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"The villain has killed me,"</Q> when he fell at the colonel's feet, and in&s;tantly expired. No one had &s;een the blow, nor the per&s;on who gave it; but an hat being picked up, on the in&s;ide of which was &s;ewed a paper, containing four or five lines of the remon&s;trance of the commons again&s;t the duke, it was concluded that this hat mu&s;t be|long to the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in; and while they were employed in conjectures who&s;e it &s;hould be, a man without an hat, was &s;een walking very compo&s;edly before the door, and was heard to cry out, I am he.

When a&s;ked at who&s;e in&s;tigation he had performed that horrid deed? he an&s;wered, that they need not trouble them&s;elves in that enquiry; that his con&s;ci|ence was his only prompter, and that no man on earth could di&s;po&s;e him to act again&s;t its dictates. He &s;uffered with the &s;ame degree of con&s;tancy to the la&s;t; nor were there many wanting who admired not only his fortitude, but the action for which he &s;uffered.</P>

<P><PB N="202" REF="216">The king's fir&s;t mea&s;ure, now being left without a mini&s;ter and a parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1629.</NOTE> was a prudent one. He made peace with the two crownst again&s;t whom he had hitherto waged war, which had been entered upon without ne|ce&s;&s;ity, and conducted without glory. Being freed from the&s;e embarra&s;&s;ments, he bent his whole atten|tion to the management of the internal policy of the kingdom, and took two men as his a&s;&s;ociates in this ta&s;k, who &s;till acted an under part to him&s;elf. The&s;e were Sir Thomas Wentworth, afterwards created earl of Strafford; and Laud, afterwards archbi&s;hop of Canterbury.</P>
<P>While Laud, therefore, during this long interval, ruled the church, the king and Strafford undertook to manage the temporal intere&s;ts of the nation. A declaration was di&s;per&s;ed, implying, that during this reign no more parliaments would be &s;ummoned; and every mea&s;ure of the king but too well &s;erved to con|firm the &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>Tonnage and poundage were continued to be le|vied by royal authority alone: cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers received orders from the council to enter any hou&s;e whatever, in &s;earch of &s;u&s;pected goods: compo&s;i|tions were openly made with papi&s;ts; and their reli|gion was become a regular part of the revenue. The high commi&s;&s;ion court of Star-chamber exerci&s;ed its power, independant of any law, upon &s;everal bold innovators in liberty, who only gloried in their &s;uf|ferings, and contributed to render government odi|ous and contemptible. Prynne, a barri&s;ter of Lin|coln's inn, Burton, a divine, and Ba&s;twick, a phy|&s;ician, were tried before this tribunal for &s;chi&s;mati|cal libels, in which they attacked, with great &s;everi|ty and intemperate zeal, the ceremonies of the church of England. They were condemned to be pilloried, to lo&s;e their ears, and to pay five thou&s;and pounds to the king.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="217">Every year, every month, every day, gave fre&s;h in&s;tances, during this long intermi&s;&s;ion of parlia|ments, of the re&s;olutions of the court to throw them off for ever: but the levying of <HI>&s;hip-money,</HI> as it was called, being a general burthen, was univer&s;ally complained of as a national grievance. This was a tax which had, in former reigns, been levied with|out the con&s;ent of parliament; but then the exigency of the &s;tate demanded &s;uch a &s;upply. John Ham|den, a gentleman of fortune in Buckingham&s;hire, refu&s;ed to comply with the tax, and re&s;olved to bring it to a legal determination. He had been rated at twenty-&s;hillings for his e&s;tate, which he refu&s;ed to pay; and the ca&s;e was argued twelve days in the Ex|chequer chamber, before all the judges of England. The nation regarded, with the utmo&s;t anxiety, the re&s;ult of a trial that was to fix the limits of the king's power. All the judges, four only excepted, gave &s;entence in favour of the crown; while Hamden, who lo&s;t his cau&s;e, was more than &s;ufficiently recom|pen&s;ed by the applau&s;es of the people.</P>
<P>The di&s;content and oppo&s;ition which the king met with in maintaining epi&s;copacy among his Engli&s;h &s;ub|j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cts might, one would think, hinder him from at|tempting to introduce it among tho&s;e of Scotland, where it was generally hateful. Having publi&s;hed an order for reading the liturgy in the principal church in Edinburgh, the people received it with clamours and imprecations. The &s;editious di&s;po&s;i|tion in that kingdom, which had hitherto been kept within bounds, was now too furious for re&s;traint, and the in&s;urrection became general over all the country, and the Scotch flew to arms with great ani|mo&s;ity.</P>
<P>Yet &s;till the king could not think of de&s;i&s;ting from his de&s;ign; and &s;o prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed was he in favour of royal right, that he thought the very name of king, when forcibly urged, would induce them to return
<PB N="204" REF="218">
to their duty. In&s;tead therefore of fighting with his opponents, he entered upon a treaty with them; &s;o that a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms was &s;oon agreed upon, and a treaty of peace concluded, which neither &s;ide in|tended to ob&s;erve; and then both parties agreed to di&s;band their forces. After much altercation, and many treaties &s;igned and broken, both parties once more had recour&s;e to arms, and nothing but blood could &s;atiate the contenders.</P>
<P>War being thus re&s;olved on, the king took every method as before for rai&s;ing money to &s;upport it. Ship-money was levied as u&s;ual; &s;ome other arbitrary taxes were exacted from the reluctant people with great &s;everity; but the&s;e were far from being &s;uffi|cient; and there now remained only one method more, the long neglected method of a parliamentary &s;upply.</P>
<P>The new hou&s;e of commons, however, could not be induced to treat the Scotch, who were of the &s;ame principles with them&s;elves, and contending again&s;t the &s;ame ceremonies, as enemies to the &s;tate. They regarded them as friends and brothers, who fir&s;t ro&s;e to teach them a duty it was incumbent on all virtuous minds to imitate. The king, therefore, could reap no o|ther fruits from this a&s;&s;embly than murmurings and complaints. Every method he had taken to &s;upply him&s;elf with money was declared an abu&s;e, and a breach of the con&s;titution. The king, therefore, finding no hopes of a compliance with his reque&s;t, but recrimination in&s;tead of redre&s;s, once more di&s;&s;olved the parliament, to try more fea&s;ible methods of re|moving his nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P>His nece&s;&s;ities however continuing, that parlia|ment was called, which did not cea&s;e &s;itting till they overturned the con&s;titution. Without any interval, they entered upon bu&s;ine&s;s; and by unanimous con|&s;ent they &s;truck a blow that might be regarded as deci&s;ive. In&s;tead of granting the demanded &s;ub&s;i|dies,
<PB N="205" REF="219">
they impeached the earl of Strafford, the king's fir&s;t mini&s;ter, and had him arraigned before the hou&s;e of peers for high trea&s;on. After a long and eloquent &s;peech, delivered without premeditation, in which he confuted all the accu&s;ations of his enemies, he was found guilty by both hou&s;es of parliament; and nothing remained but for the king to give his con&s;ent to the bill of attainder. Charles, who loved Strafford tenderly, he&s;itated, and &s;eemed reluctant, trying every expedient to put off &s;o dread|ful a duty, as that of &s;igning the warrant for his exe|cution. While he continued in this agitation of mind, not knowing how to act, his doubts were at la&s;t &s;ilenced by an act of heroic bravery in the con|demned lord. He received a letter from that unfor|tunate nobleman, de&s;iring that his life might be made the &s;acrifice of a mutual reconciliation between the king and his people; adding, that he was pre|pared to die, and to a willing mind there could be no injury. This in&s;tance of noble genero&s;ity was but ill repaid by his ma&s;ter, who complied with his re|que&s;t. He con&s;ented to the &s;igning the fatal bill by commi&s;&s;ion; Strafford was beheaded on Tower-hill, behaving with all that compo&s;ed dignity of re&s;olution that was expected from his character.</P>
<P>In this univer&s;al rage for puni&s;hment, the parlia|ment fell with great ju&s;tice on two courts, which had been erected under arbitrary kings, and had &s;eldom been employed but in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity. The&s;e were, the High-commi&s;&s;ion court, and the court of Star-chamber. A bill unanimou&s;ly pa&s;&s;ed the hou&s;es to aboli&s;h both; and in them to annihilate the principal and mo&s;t dangerous articles in the king's prerogative.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e troubles, the papi&s;ts of Ire|land fancied they found a convenient opportunity of throwing off the Engli&s;h yoke, and accordingly re|&s;olved to cut off all the prote&s;tants of the kingdom at a &s;troke; &s;o that neither age, &s;ex, or condition, re|ceived
<PB N="206" REF="220">
any pity. In &s;uch indi&s;criminate &s;laughter, neither former benefits, nor alliances, nor authority, were any protection: numberle&s;s were the in&s;tances of friends murdering their intimates, relations their kin&s;men, and &s;ervants their ma&s;ters. In vain did flight &s;ave from the fir&s;t a&s;&s;ault; de&s;truction, that had an exten&s;ive &s;pread, met the hunted victims at every turn.</P>
<P>The king took all the precautions in his power to &s;hew his utter dete&s;tation of the&s;e bloody proceed|ings; and being &s;en&s;ible of his own inability to &s;up|pre&s;s the rebellion, had once more recour&s;e to his Engli&s;h parliament, and craved their a&s;&s;i&s;tance for a &s;upply. But here he found no hopes of a&s;&s;i&s;tance; many in&s;inuations were thrown out that he had him|&s;elf fomented this rebellion, and no money could be &s;pared for the extinction of di&s;tant dangers, when they pretended that the kingdom was threatened with greater at home.</P>
<P>It was now that the republican &s;pirit began to ap|pear without any di&s;gui&s;e in the pre&s;ent parliament; and that party, in&s;tead of attacking the faults of the king, re&s;olved to de&s;troy monarchy.</P>
<P>The leaders of the oppo&s;ition began their opera|tions by a re&s;olution to attack epi&s;copacy, which was one of the &s;tronge&s;t bulwarks of the royal power.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1641.</NOTE> They accu&s;ed thirteen bi|&s;hops of high trea&s;on, for enacting canons without the con&s;ent of parliament; and en|deavoured to prevail upon the hou&s;e of peers to ex|clude all the prelates from their &s;eats and votes in that augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly. The bi&s;hops &s;aw the &s;torm that was gathering again&s;t them; and, probably, to avert its effects, they re&s;olved to attend their duty in the hou&s;e of lords no longer.</P>
<P>This was a fatal blow to the royal intere&s;t; but it &s;oon felt a much greater from the king's own impru|dence. Charles had long &s;uppre&s;&s;ed his re&s;entment,
<PB N="207" REF="221">
and only &s;trove to &s;atisfy the commons by the great|ne&s;s of his conce&s;&s;ions; but finding that all his com|pliance had but encrea&s;ed their demands, he could no longer contain. He gave orders to Herbert, his attorney-general, to enter an accu&s;ation of high trea|&s;on in the hou&s;e of peers again&s;t lord Kimbolton, one of the mo&s;t popular men of his party, together with five commoners, Sir Arthur Ha&s;lerig, Hollis, Hambden, Pym, and Strode. The articles were, that they had traiterou&s;ly endeavoured to &s;ubvert the fundamental laws and government of the kingdom; to deprive the king of his regal power, and to im|po&s;e on his &s;ubjects an arbitrary and tyrannical authority. Men had &s;carce lei&s;ure to wonder at the precipitancy and imprudence of this im|peachment, when they were a&s;toni&s;hed by another mea&s;ure, &s;till more ra&s;h and more un&s;upported. The next day the king him&s;elf was &s;een to enter the hou&s;e of commons alone, advancing through the hall, while all the members &s;tood up to receive him. The &s;peaker withdrew from his chair, and the king took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. Having &s;eated him&s;elf, and looked round him for &s;ome time, he told the hou&s;e that he was &s;orry for the occa&s;ion that forced him thither, that he was come in per&s;on to &s;eize the members, whom he had accu&s;ed of high trea&s;on, &s;eeing they would not deliver them up to his &s;erjeant at arms. He then &s;ate for &s;ome time to &s;ee if the accu&s;ed were pre&s;ent; but they had e&s;caped a few minutes before his entry. Thus di&s;appointed, per|plexed, and not knowing on whom to rely, he next proceeded, amid&s;t the clamours of the populace, who continued to cry out, "Privilege! privilege!" to the common council of the city, and made his complaint to them. The common council only an|&s;wered his complaints with a contemptuous &s;ilence; and on his return, one of the populace, more in&s;o|lent than the re&s;t, cried out,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"To your tents, O
<PB N="208" REF="222">
I&s;rael!"</Q>
a watch word among the Jews, when they intended to abandon their princes.</P>
<P>Being returned to Wind&s;or, he began to reflect on the ra&s;hne&s;s of his former proceedings; and now too late re&s;olved to make &s;ome atonement. He there|fore wrote to the parliament, informing them, that he de&s;i&s;ted from his former proceedings again&s;t the accu&s;ed members; and a&s;&s;ured them, that upon all occa&s;ions he would be as careful of their privileges as of his life or his crown. Thus his former vio|lence had rendered him hateful to his commons, and his pre&s;ent &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion now rendered him contempti|ble.</P>
<P>The power of appointing generals and levying ar|mies was &s;till a remaining prerogative of the crown. The commons having, therefore, fir&s;t magnified their terrors of popery, which perhaps they actually dreaded, they proceeded to petition that the Tower might be put into their hands, and that Hull, Port&s;|mouth, and the fleet, &s;hould be intru&s;ted to per&s;ons of their chu&s;ing. The&s;e were reque&s;ts, the comply|ing with which levelled all that remained of the an|cient con&s;titution; however, &s;uch was the nece&s;&s;ity of the times, that they were at fir&s;t conte&s;ted, and then granted. At la&s;t, every compliance only en|crea&s;ing the avidity of making fre&s;h demands, the commons de&s;ired to have a militia, rai&s;ed and go|verned by &s;uch officers and commanders as they &s;hould nominate, under pretext of &s;ecuring them from the Iri&s;h papi&s;ts, of whom they were in great apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>It was here that Charles fir&s;t ventured to put a &s;top to his conce&s;&s;ions, and being urged to give up the command of the army for an appointed time, he was &s;o exa&s;perated, that he exclaimed, "No, not for an hour." This peremptory refu&s;al broke off all further treaty; and both &s;ides were now re&s;olved to have re|cour&s;e to arms.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="223">No period &s;ince England began could &s;hew &s;o many in&s;tances of courage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1642.</NOTE> abili|ties, and virtue, as the pre&s;ent fatal oppo|&s;ition called forth into exertion. Now was the time when talents of all kinds, unchecked by authority, were called from the lower ranks of life to di&s;pute for power and pre-eminence.</P>
<P>Manife&s;toes on the one &s;ide and the other were now di&s;per&s;ed throughout the whole king|dom; and the people were univer&s;ally divid|ed between two factions, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the names of Cavaliers and Roundheads. The king's forces appeared in a very low condition; be&s;ides the train-bands of the county, rai&s;ed by Sir John Digby, the &s;heriff, he had not got together three hundred infantry. His cavalry, which compo&s;ed his chief &s;trength, exceeded not eight hundred, and were very ill provided with arms. However, he was &s;oon gra|dually reinforced from all quarters; but not being then in a condition to face his enemies, he thought it prudent to retire by &s;low marches to Derby, and thence to Shrew&s;bury, in order to countenance the levies which his friends were making in tho&s;e quar|ters.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the parliament were not remi&s;s in preparations on their &s;ide. They had a magazine of arms at Hull, and Sir John Hotham was appoint|ed governor of that place by parliament. The forces al&s;o, which had been every where rai&s;ed on pretence of the &s;ervice of Ireland, were now more openly en|li&s;ted by the parliament for their own purpo&s;es; and the command given to the earl of E&s;&s;ex, a bold man, who rather de&s;ired to &s;ee monarchy abridged, than totally de&s;troyed, and in London, no le&s;s than four thou&s;and men were enli&s;ted in one day.</P>
<P>Edge-Hill was the fir&s;t place where the two armies were put in array again&s;t each other, and the coun|try drenched in civil &s;laughter. It was a dreadful
<PB N="210" REF="224">
&s;ight, to &s;ee above thirty thou&s;and of the brave&s;t men in the world, in&s;tead of employing their courage a|broad, turning it again&s;t each other, while the dear|e&s;t friends, and neare&s;t kin&s;men, embraced oppo&s;ite &s;ides, and prepared to bury their private regards in factious hatred. After an engagement of &s;ome hours, animo&s;ity &s;eemed to be wearied out, and both &s;ides &s;eparated with equal lo&s;s. Five thou&s;and men are &s;aid to have been found dead on the field of battle.</P>
<P>It would be tedious, and no way in&s;tructive, to enter into the marchings and countermarchings of the&s;e undi&s;ciplined and ill conducted armies: war was a new trade to the Engli&s;h, as they had not &s;een an ho&s;tile engagement in the i&s;land for near a cen|tury before. The queen came to re-inforce the royal party; &s;he had brought &s;oldiers and ammunition from Holland, and immediately departed to furni&s;h more. But the parliament, who knew its own con|&s;equence and &s;trength, was no way di&s;couraged. Their demands &s;eemed to encrea&s;e in proportion to their lo&s;&s;es; and as they were repre&s;&s;ed in the field, they grew more haughty in the cabinet. Such governors as gave up their fortre&s;&s;es to the king, were attainted of high trea&s;on. It was in vain for the king to &s;end propo&s;als after any &s;ucce&s;s; this only rai&s;ed their pride and their animo&s;ity. But though this de&s;ire in the king to make peace with his &s;ubjects was the highe&s;t encomium on his humanity, yet his long necogciations, one of which he carried on at Oxford, were faulty as a warrior. He wa&s;ted that time in altercation and treaty, which he &s;hould have employ|ed in vigorous exertions in the field.</P>
<P>However, his fir&s;t campaign, upon the whole, wore a favourable a&s;pect. One victory followed after another; Cornwall was reduced to peace and obedi|ence under the king: a victory was gained over the parliamentarians at Stratton Hill, in Devon&s;hire;
<PB N="211" REF="225">
another at Roundway Down, about two miles from the Devizes; and &s;till a third at Chalgrave Field. Bri&s;tol was be&s;ieged and taken, and Glouce&s;ter was inve&s;ted; the battle of Newbury was favourable to the royal cau&s;e, and great hopes of &s;ucce&s;s were formed from an army in the North, rai&s;ed by the marquis of Newca&s;tle.</P>
<P>In this fir&s;t campaign, the two brave&s;t and greate&s;t men of their re&s;pective parties were killed; as if it was intended, by the kindne&s;s of Providence, that they &s;hould be exempted from &s;eeing the mi&s;eries and the &s;laughter which were &s;hortly to en&s;ue. The&s;e were John Hampden, and Lucius Cary, lord Falkland.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t in a &s;kirmi&s;h again&s;t prince Rupert, the other in the battle of Newbury, which followed &s;hortly after. Hampden, whom we have &s;een in the beginning of the&s;e troubles, refu&s;e to pay &s;hip-money, gained, by his inflexible integrity, the e&s;teem even of his enemies. To the&s;e he added affability in con|ver&s;ation, temper, art, eloquence in debate, and penetration in council.</P>
<P>Falkland was &s;till a greater lo&s;s, and a greater character. He added to Hamden's &s;evere principles, a politene&s;s and elegance, but then beginning to be known in England. He had boldly with&s;tood the king's preten&s;ions, while he &s;aw him making a bad u&s;e of his power; but when he perceived the de&s;ign of the parliament, to overturn the religion and the con&s;titution of his country, he changed his &s;ide, and &s;tedfa&s;tly attached him&s;elf to the crown. From the beginning of the civil war, his natural chearfulne&s;s and vivacity for&s;ook him; he became melancholy, &s;ad, pale, and negligent of his per&s;on, and &s;eemed to wi&s;h for death. His u&s;ual cry among his friends, after a deep &s;ilence, and frequent &s;ighs, was Peace! Peace! He now &s;aid, upon the morning of the en|gagement, that he was weary of the times, and &s;hould leave them before night. He was &s;hot by a
<PB N="212" REF="226">
mu&s;quet-ball in the belly; and his body was next morning found among an heap of &s;lain. His writ|ings, his elegance, his ju&s;tice, and his courage, de|&s;erved &s;uch a death of glory: and they found it.</P>
<P>The king, that he might make preparations dur|ing the winter for the en&s;uing campaign, and to oppo&s;e the de&s;igns of the We&s;tmin&s;ter parliament, called one at Oxford; and this was the fir&s;t time that England &s;aw two parliaments &s;itting at the &s;ame time. His hou&s;e of peers was pretty full; his hou&s;e of com|mons con&s;i&s;ted of about an hundred and forty, which amounted to not above half of the other hou&s;e of commons. From this &s;hadow of a parliament he received &s;ome &s;upplies, after which it was prorogued, and never after a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>In the mean time the parliament was equally ac|tive on their &s;ide. They pa&s;&s;ed an ordinance, com|manding all the inhabitants of London and its neigh|bourhood to retrench a meal a week, and to pay the value of it for the &s;upport of the public cau&s;e. But what was much more effectual, the Scotch, who con&s;idered their claims as &s;imilar, led a &s;trong body to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. They levied an army of four|teen thou&s;and men in the Ea&s;t, under the earl of Manche&s;ter; they had an army of ten thou&s;and men under E&s;&s;ex, another of nearly the &s;ame force, under Sir William Waller. The&s;e were &s;uperior to any force the king could bring into the field; and were well appointed with ammunition, provi&s;ions and pay.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1644.</NOTE>Ho&s;tilities, which even during the win|ter &s;ea&s;on had never been wholly di&s;conti|nued, were renewed in &s;pring with their u&s;ual fury, and &s;erved to de&s;olate the king|dom, without deciding victory.

for peace; and all the wi&s;e and good were earne&s;t in the cry. What particularly de&s;erves remark, was an attempt of the women of London; who, to the number of two or three thou&s;and, went in a body to the hou&s;e of commons, earne&s;tly demanding a peace. "Give us tho&s;e traitors, &s;aid they, that are again&s;t a peace; give them, that we may tear them in pie|ces." The guards found &s;ome difficulty in quelling this in&s;urrection, and one or two women lo&s;t their lives in the fray.</P>
<P>The battle of Mar&s;ton-Moor was the beginning of the king's misfortunes and di&s;grace. The Scotch and parliamentarian army had joined, and were be|&s;ieging York; when prince Rupert, joined by the marquis of Newca&s;tle, determined to rai&s;e the &s;iege. Both &s;ides drew up on Mar&s;ton Moor, to the number of fifty thou&s;and, and the victory &s;eemed long unde|cided between them. Rupert, who commanded the right wing of the royali&s;ts, was oppo&s;ed by Oliver Cromwell, who now fir&s;t came into notice, at the head of a body of troops, whom he had taken care to levy and di&s;cipline. Cromwell was victorious; he pu&s;hed his opponents off the field, followed the vanqui&s;hed, returned to a &s;econd engagement, and a &s;econd victory; the prince's whole train of artille|ry was taken, and the royali&s;ts never after recovered the blow.</P>
<P>William Laud, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, was &s;ent to the Tower in the beginning of this reign. He was now brought to his trial, condemned and executed. And it was a melancholy con&s;ideration, that in the&s;e times of trouble, the be&s;t men were tho&s;e on either &s;ide who chiefly &s;uffered.</P>
<P>The death of Laud was followed by a total altera|tion of the ceremonies of the church. The Liturgy was, by a public act, aboli&s;hed the day he died, as if he had been the only ob&s;tacle to its former removal. The church of England was in all re&s;pects brought

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">June 14, 1645.</NOTE>The well-di&s;puted battle, which de|cided the fate of Charles, was fought at Na&s;eby, a village in York&s;hire. The main body of the royal army was com|manded by lord A&s;tley, prince Rupert led the right wing, Sir Marmaduke Langdale the left, and the king him&s;elf headed the body of re&s;erve. On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, Fairfax and Skippon commanded the main body; Cromwell led on the right wing, and Ireton, his &s;on-in-law, the left. Prince Rupert at|tacked the left wing with his u&s;ual impetuo&s;ity and &s;ucce&s;s: they were broke and pur&s;ued as far as the village; but he lo&s;t time in attempting to make him|&s;elf ma&s;ter of their artillery. Cromwell, in the mean time, was equally &s;ucce&s;sful on his &s;ide, and broke through the enemies hor&s;e after a very ob&s;tinate re|&s;i&s;tance. While the&s;e were thus engaged, the in|fantry on both &s;ides maintained the conflict with e|qual ardour; but in &s;pite of the efforts of Fairfax and Skippon, their battalions began to give way. But it was now that Cromwell returned with his victori|ous forces, and charged the king's infantry in flank with &s;uch vigour, that a total rout began to en&s;ue. By this time prince Rupert had rejoined the king, and the &s;mall body of re&s;erve; but his troops, though victorious, could not be brought to a &s;econd charge. The king perceiving the battle wholly lo&s;t, was obliged to abandon the field to his enemies, who took all his cannon, baggage, and above five thou&s;and pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>The battle of Na&s;eby put the parliamentarians in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of almo&s;t all the &s;trong cities of the king|dom, Bri&s;tol, Bridgewater, Che&s;ter, Sherborn, and Bath. Exeter was be&s;ieged; and all the king's troops in the we&s;tern counties being entirely di&s;per&s;ed,
<PB N="215" REF="229">
Fairfax pre&s;&s;ed the place, and it &s;urrendered at di&s;|cretion. The king thus &s;urrounded, harra&s;&s;ed on every &s;ide, retreated to Oxford, that in all condi|tions of his fortune had held &s;teady to his cau&s;e; and there he re&s;olved to offer new terms to his incen&s;ed pur&s;uers.</P>
<P>In the mean time Fairfax was approaching with a powerful and victorious army, and was taking the proper mea&s;ures of laying &s;iege to Oxford, which promi&s;ed an ea&s;y &s;urrender. To be taken captive, and led in triumph by his in&s;olent &s;ubjects, was what Charles ju&s;tly abhorred; and every in&s;ult and violence was to be dreaded from the &s;oldiery, who had felt the effects of his oppo&s;ition. In this de&s;pe|rate extremity he embraced a mea&s;ure which, in any other &s;ituation, might ju&s;tly lie under the imputation of imprudence and indi&s;cretion. He took the fatal re&s;olution of giving him&s;elf up to the Scotch army, who had never te&s;tified &s;uch implacable animo&s;ity again&s;t him; and he too &s;oon found, that in&s;tead of treating him as a king, they in&s;ulted him as a cap|tive.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h parliament being informed of the king's captivity, immediately entered into a treaty with the Scotch about delivering up their pri&s;oner. This was &s;oon adju&s;ted. They agreed, that upon payment of four hundred thou&s;and pounds they would deliver up the king to his enemies, and this was chearfully complied with. An action &s;o atroci|ous may be palliated, but can never be defended; they returned home laden with plunder, and the re|proaches of all good men.</P>
<P>The civil war was now over; the king had ab&s;olv|ed his followers from their allegiance, and the parlia|ment had now no enemy to fear, except tho&s;e very troops by which they had extended their overgrown authority. But in proportion as the terror of the king's power dimini&s;hed, the divi&s;ions between the
<PB N="216" REF="230">
members which compo&s;ed the parliament, became more apparent. The majority in the hou&s;e were of the pre&s;byterian &s;ect, who were for having clergy; but the majority of the army were &s;taunch indepen|dents, who admitted of no clergy, but thought that every man had a right to in&s;truct his fellows. At the head of this &s;ect was Cromwell, who &s;ecretly directed its operations, and invigorated all their mea|&s;ures.</P>
<P>Oliver Cromwell, who&s;e talents now began to ap|pear in full lu&s;tre, was the &s;on of a private gentle|man of Huntingdon; but being the &s;on of a &s;econd brother, he inherited a very &s;mall paternal fortune. From accident or intrigue, he was cho&s;en member for the town of Cambridge, in the long parliament; but he &s;eemed at fir&s;t to po&s;&s;e&s;s no talents for oratory, his per&s;on being ungraceful, his dre&s;s &s;lovenly, his elocution homely, tedious, ob&s;cure, and embarra&s;&s;ed. He made up, however, by zeal and per&s;everance, what he wanted in natural powers; and being en|dowed with un&s;haken intrepidity, much di&s;&s;imula|tion, and a thorough conviction of the rectitude of his cau&s;e, he ro&s;e, through the gradations of prefer|ment, to the po&s;t of lieutenant-general under Fair|fax; but, in reality, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the &s;upreme command over the whole army.</P>
<P>The army now began to con&s;ider them&s;elves as a body di&s;tinct from the commonwealth; and com|plained, that they had &s;ecured the general tranquility, while they were, at the &s;ame time, deprived of the privileges of Engli&s;hmen. In oppo&s;ition, therefore, to the parliament at We&s;tmin&s;ter, a military parlia|ment was formed, compo&s;ed of the officers and com|mon &s;oldiers of each regiment. The principal offi|cers formed a council to repre&s;ent the body of peers; the &s;oldiers elected two men out of each company to repre&s;ent the hou&s;e of commons, and the&s;e were called the agitators of the army. Cromwell took
<PB N="217" REF="231">
care to be one of the number, and thus contrived an ea&s;y method under-hand of conducting and promot|ing the &s;edition of the army.</P>
<P>The unhappy king, in the mean time, continued a pri&s;oner at Holmby ca&s;tle; and as his countenance might add &s;ome authority to that &s;ide which &s;hould obtain it, Cromwell, who &s;ecretly conducted all the mea&s;ures of the army, while he apparently exclaim|ed again&s;t their violence, re&s;olved to &s;eize the king's per&s;on. Accordingly, a party of five hundred hor&s;e appearing at Holmby ca&s;tle, under the command of one Joyce, conducted the king to the army, who were ha&s;tening to their rendezvous at Triplo-heath, near Cambridge. The next day Cromwell arrived among them, where he was received with acclama|tions of joy, and was in&s;tantly inve&s;ted with the &s;u|preme command.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e of commons was now divided into par|ties, as u&s;ual, one part oppo&s;ing, but the minority, with the two &s;peakers at their head, for encouraging the army. In &s;uch an univer&s;al confu&s;ion, it is not to be expected that any thing le&s;s than a &s;eparation of the parties could take place; and accordingly the two &s;peakers, with &s;ixty-two members, &s;ecretly re|tired from the hou&s;e, and threw them&s;elves under the protection of the army, that were then at Houn|&s;low heath. They were received with &s;houts and acclamations, their integrity was extolled, and the whole body of the &s;oldiery, a formidable force of twenty thou&s;and men, now moved forward to rein|&s;tate them in their former &s;eats and &s;tations.</P>
<P>In the mean time, that part of the hou&s;e that was left behind, re&s;olved to act with vigour, and re&s;i&s;t the encroachments of the army. They cho&s;e new &s;peakers, they gave orders for enli&s;ting troops, they ordered the train-bands to man the lines, and the whole city boldly re&s;olved to re&s;i&s;t the inva&s;ion. But this re&s;olution only held while the enemy was thought
<PB N="218" REF="232">
at a di&s;tance; for when the formidable force of Cromwell appeared, all was obedience and &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion; the gates were opened to the general, who attended the two &s;peakers, and the re&s;t of the mem|bers, peaceably to their habitations. The eleven impeached members, being accu&s;ed as cau&s;es of the tumult, were expelled, and mo&s;t of them retired to the continent. The mayor, &s;heriff, and three al|dermen, were &s;ent to the Tower; &s;everal citizens, and officers of militia, were committed to pri&s;on, and the lines about the city were levelled to the ground. The command of the Tower was given to Fairfax, the general; and the parliament ordered him their hearty thanks for having di&s;obeyed their commands.</P>
<P>It now only remained to di&s;po&s;e of the king, who had been &s;ent by the army a pri&s;oner to Hampton-Court; from whence he attempted to e&s;cape, but was once more made pri&s;oner in the I&s;le of Wight, and confined in Cari&s;brook ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>While the king continued in this forlorn &s;ituation, the parliament, new-modelled as it was by the army, was every day growing more feeble and factious. He &s;till therefore continued to negociate with the parliament for &s;ettling the un&s;peakable calamities of the kingdom. The parliament &s;aw no other method of de&s;troying the military power, but to depre&s;s it by the kingly. Frequent propo&s;als for an accommo|dation pa&s;&s;ed between the captive king and the com|mons.</P>
<P>But it was now too late; their power was &s;oon to|tally to expire, for the rebellious army, crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, was returned from the de&s;truction of their enemies; and, &s;en&s;ible of their own power, with furious remon&s;trances began to demand venge|ance on the king. At the &s;ame time they advanced to Wind&s;or: and &s;ending an officer to &s;eize the king's per&s;on, where he was lately &s;ent under confinement,
<PB N="219" REF="233">
they conveyed him to Hur&s;t-ca&s;tle, in Hamp&s;hire, oppo&s;ite the I&s;le of Wight. The commons, however, though de&s;titute of all hopes of prevailing, had &s;till courage to re&s;i&s;t, and attempted, in the face of the whole army, to clo&s;e their treaty with the king. But the next day colonel Pride, at the head of two regiments, blockaded the hou&s;e, and &s;eized in the pa&s;&s;age forty-one members of the pre&s;byterian party, and &s;ent them to a low room belonging to the hou&s;e, that pa&s;&s;ed by the denomination of Hell. Above an hundred and &s;ixty members more were ex|cluded; and none were allowed to enter but the mo&s;t furious and determined of the independents, in all not exceeding &s;ixty. This atrocious inva&s;ion of the parliamentary rights, commonly pa&s;&s;ed by the name of Pride's purge, and the remaining members were called the Rump. The&s;e &s;oon voted, that the tran&s;|actions of the hou&s;e a few days before were entirely illegal, and that their general's conduct was ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>A committee was appointed to bring in a charge again&s;t the king; and a vote pa&s;&s;ed declaring it trea&s;on in a king to levy war again&s;t his parliament. An High Court of Ju&s;tice was accordingly appointed to try his maje&s;ty for this new invented trea&s;on.</P>
<P>Colonel Harri&s;on, the &s;on of a butcher, was com|manded to conduct the king from Hur&s;t ca&s;tle to Wind&s;or, and from thence to London. His afflicted &s;ubjects, who ran to have a &s;ight of their &s;overeign, were greatly affected at the change that appeared in his face and per&s;on. He had allowed his beard to grow; his hair was become venerably grey, rather by the pre&s;&s;ure of anxiety than the hand of time&punc; while his apparel bore the marks of misfor|tune and decay. Thus he &s;tood a &s;olitary figure of maje&s;ty in di&s;tre&s;s, which even his adver&s;aries could not behold without reverence and compa&s;|&s;ion. He had been long attended only by an old decrepid
<PB N="220" REF="234">
&s;ervant, who&s;e name was Sir Philip Warwick, who could only deplore his ma&s;ter's fate, without being able to revenge his cau&s;e. All the exterior &s;ymbols of &s;overeignty were now withdrawn; and his new attendants had orders to &s;erve him without ceremo|ny. The duke of Hamilton, who was re&s;erved for the &s;ame puni&s;hment with his ma&s;ter, having leave to take a la&s;t farewell as he departed from Wind&s;or, threw him&s;elf at the king's feet, crying out, "My dear ma&s;ter." The unhappy monarch rai&s;ed him up, and embracing him tenderly, replied, while the tears ran down his cheeks, "I have indeed been a dear ma&s;ter to you." The&s;e were &s;evere di&s;tre&s;&s;es: how|ever, he could not be per&s;uaded that his adver&s;aries would bring him to a formal trial; but he every mo|ment expected to be di&s;patched by private a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination.</P>
<P>From the &s;ixth, to the twentieth of January, was &s;pent in making preparations for his extraordinary trial. The court of ju&s;tice con&s;i&s;ted of an hundred and thirty-three per&s;ons named by the commons; but of the&s;e never above &s;eventy met upon the trial. The members were chiefly compo&s;ed of the principal officers of the army, mo&s;t of them of very mean birth, together with &s;ome of the lower hou&s;e, and a few citizens of London. Brad&s;haw, a lawyer, was cho&s;en pre&s;ident, Coke was appointed &s;olicitor for the people of England, Dori&s;laus, Steele and A&s;ke, were named a&s;&s;i&s;tants. The court &s;at in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall.</P>
<P>The king was now conducted from Wind&s;or to St. James's, and the next day was brought before the high court to take his trial. When he was brought forward, he was conducted by the mace|bearer to a chair placed within the bar. Tho' long detained a pri&s;oner, and now produced as a crimi|nal, he &s;till &s;u&s;tained the dignity of a king; he &s;ur|veyed the members of the court with a &s;tern haugh|ty air, and, without moving his hat, &s;at down, while the members al&s;o were covered. His charge was
<PB N="221" REF="235">
then read by the &s;olicitor, accu&s;ing him of having been the cau&s;e of all the blood&s;hed which followed &s;ince the commencement of the war; at that part of the charge he could not &s;uppre&s;s a &s;mile of contempt and indignation. After the charge was fini&s;hed, Brad&s;haw directed his di&s;cour&s;e to the king, and told him, that the court expected his an&s;wer.</P>
<P>The king with great temper entered upon his de|fence, by declining the authority of the court. He repre&s;ented, that having been engaged in treaty with his two hou&s;es of parliament, and having fini&s;hed al|mo&s;t every article, he expected a different treatment from that he now received. He perceived, he &s;aid, no appearance of an upper hou&s;e, which was nece&s;|&s;ary to con&s;titute a ju&s;t tribunal. That he was him|&s;elf the king and fountain of law, and con&s;equently could not be tried by laws to which he had never given his a&s;&s;ent; that having been entru&s;ted with the liberties of the people, he would not now betray them, by recognizing a power founded in u&s;urpa|tion; that he was willing before a proper tribunal to enter into the particulars of his defence; but that before them he mu&s;t decline any apology for his in|nocence, le&s;t he &s;hould be con&s;idered as the betrayer of, and not a martyr for the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Brad&s;haw, in order to &s;upport the authority of the court, in&s;i&s;ted, that they had received their power from the people, the &s;ource of all right. He pre&s;&s;ed the pri&s;oner not to decline the authority of the court, which was delegated by the commons of England, and inter|rupted, and over-ruled the king in his attempts to reply.</P>
<P>In this manner the king was three times produced before the court, and as often per&s;i&s;ted in declining its juri&s;diction. The fourth and la&s;t time he was brought before the &s;elf-created tribunal, as he was proceeding thither, he was in&s;ulted by the &s;oldiers and the mob, who exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Ju&s;tice! ju&s;tice! execution! execution!"</Q> but he continued undaunt|ed.
<PB N="222" REF="236">
His judges having now examined &s;ome witne&s;|&s;es, by whom it was proved that the king had ap|peared in arms again&s;t the forces commi&s;&s;ioned by parliament, they pronounced &s;entence again&s;t him.</P>
<P>The conduct of the king under all the&s;e in&s;tances of low-bred malice was great, firm, and equal; in going through the hall from this execrable tribunal, the &s;oldiers and rabble were again in&s;tigated to cry out ju&s;tice and execution. They reviled him with the mo&s;t bitter reproaches. Among other in&s;ults, one mi&s;creant pre&s;umed to &s;pit in the face of his &s;o|vereign. He patiently bore their in&s;olence.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Poor &s;ouls, cried he, they would treat their generals in the &s;ame manner for &s;ix-pence."</Q>
Tho&s;e of the populace, who &s;till retained the feelings of humanity, expre&s;&s;ed their &s;orrow in &s;ighs and tears. A &s;oldier, more compa&s;&s;ionate than the re&s;t, could not help im|ploring a ble&s;&s;ing upon his royal head. An officer overhearing him, &s;truck the hone&s;t centinel to the ground before the king, who could not help &s;aying, that the puni&s;hment exceeded the offence.</P>
<P>At his return to Whitehall, he de&s;ired the permi&s;|&s;ion of the hou&s;e to &s;ee his children, and to be at|tended in his private devotions by doctor Juxon, late bi&s;hop of London. The&s;e reque&s;ts were granted, and al&s;o three days to prepare for the execution of the &s;entence. All that remained of his family now in England, were the prince&s;s Elizabeth, and the duke of Glouce&s;ter, a child of about three years of age. After many &s;ea&s;onable and &s;en&s;ible exhorta|tions to his daughter, he took his little &s;on in his arms, and embracing him,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My child, &s;aid he, they will cut off thy father's head, yes, they will cut off my head, and make thee a king. But mark what I &s;ay; thou mu&s;t not be a king as long as thy brothers Charles and James are alive. They will cut off their heads when they can take them, and thy head too they will cut off at la&s;t, and
<PB N="223" REF="237">
therefore I charge thee do not be made a king by them"</Q>
The child, bur&s;ting into tears, replied, <Q REND="inline">""I will be torn in pieces fir&s;t.""</Q></P>
<P>Every night during the interval between his &s;en|tence and execution, the king &s;lept &s;ound as u&s;ual, though the noi&s;e of the workmen, employed in fram|ing the &s;caffold, continually re&s;ounded in his ears. The fatal morning being at la&s;t arrived, he ro&s;e early; and calling one of his attendants, he bad him employ more than u&s;ual care in dre&s;&s;ing him, and preparing him for &s;o great and joyful a &s;olemnity. The &s;treet before Whitehall was the place de&s;tined for his execution; for it was intended that this would increa&s;e the &s;everity of his puni&s;hment. He was led through the Banquetting Hou&s;e to the &s;caffold adjoining to that edifice, attended by his friend and &s;ervant bi|&s;hop Juxon, a man endowed with the &s;ame mild and &s;teady virtues with his ma&s;ter. The &s;caffold, which was covered with black, was guarded by a regiment of &s;oldiers, under the command of colonel Tomlin|&s;on, and on it were to be &s;een the block, the ax, and two executioners in ma&s;ques. The people in great crowds &s;tood at a greater di&s;tance, in dreadful expectation of the event. The king &s;urveyed all the&s;e &s;olemn preparations with calm compo&s;ure; and as he could not expect to be heard by the people at a di&s;tance, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the few per&s;ons who &s;tood round him. He there ju&s;tified his own innocence in the late fatal war; and ob&s;erved, that he had not taken arms till after the parliament had &s;hewn him the example. That he had no other ob|ject in his warlike preparations than to pre&s;erve that authority entire, which had been tran&s;mitted to him by his ance&s;tors: but, though innocent towards his people, he acknowledged the equity of his execution in the eyes of his Maker. He owned that he was ju&s;tly puni&s;hed for having con&s;ented to the execution of an unju&s;t &s;entence upon the earl of Strafford.
<PB N="224" REF="238">
He forgave all his enemies, exhorted the people to return to their obedience, and acknowledge his &s;on as his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and &s;ignified his attachment to the prote&s;tant religion, as profe&s;&s;ed in the church of England. So &s;trong was the impre&s;&s;ion of his dying words made upon the few who could hear him, that colonel Tomlin&s;on him&s;elf, to who&s;e care he had been committed, acknowledged him&s;elf a convert.</P>
<P>While he was preparing him&s;elf for the block, bi&s;hop Juxon called out to him;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There is, Sir, but one &s;tage more, which, though turbulent and trouble&s;ome, is yet a very &s;hort one. It will &s;oon carry you a great way. It will carry you from earth to heaven, and there you &s;hall find, to your great joy, the prize to which you ha&s;ten, a crown of glory."</Q>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I go, replied the king, from a cor|ruptible to an incorruptible crown, where no di&s;|turbance can have place."</Q>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You exchange, re|plied the bi&s;hop, a temporal for an eternal crown, a good exchange."</Q>
Charles having taken off his cloak delivered his George to the prelate, pronounc|ing the word, "Remember." Then he laid his neck on the block, and &s;tretching out his hands as a &s;ignal, one of the executioners &s;evered his head from his body at a blow, while the other, holding it up, exclaimed, "This is the head of a traitor." The &s;pectators te&s;tified their horror at that &s;ad &s;pecta|cle in &s;ighs, tears, and lamentations; the tide of their duty and affection began to return, and each blamed him&s;elf either with active di&s;loyalty to his king, or a pa&s;&s;ive compliance with his de&s;troyers.</P>
<P>Charles was executed in the forty-ninth year of his age,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 30, 1649.</NOTE> and the twenty-fourth of his reign. He was of a middling &s;tature, robu&s;t, and well proportioned. His vi&s;age was plea&s;ing, but melancholy; and it is probable that the continual troubles in which he was involved, might have made that impre&s;&s;ion on his counte|nance.
<PB N="225" REF="239">
As for his character, the reader will deduce it with more preci&s;ion and &s;atisfaction to him&s;elf from the detail of his conduct, than from any &s;ummary given of it by the hi&s;torian.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIX. THE COMMONWEALTH.</HEAD>
<P>CROMWELL, who had &s;ecretly &s;ol|licited, and contrived the king's death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1649.</NOTE> now began to feel wi&s;hes to which he had been hitherto a &s;tranger. His pro&s;pects widening as he ro&s;e, his fir&s;t principles of liberty were all lo&s;t in the unbounded &s;tretch of power that lay before him.</P>
<P>Having been appointed to command the army in Ireland, he pro&s;ecuted the war in that kingdom with his u&s;ual &s;ucce&s;s. He had to combat again&s;t the Royali&s;ts, commanded by the duke of Ormond, and the native Iri&s;h, led on by O'Neal. But &s;uch ill connected and barbarous troops could give very little oppo&s;ition to Cromwell's more numerous forces, conducted by &s;uch a general, and emboldened by long &s;ucce&s;s. He &s;oon over-ran the whole country; and after &s;ome time, all the towns revolted in his favour, and opened their gates at his approach. But in the&s;e conque&s;ts, as in all the re&s;t of his actions, there appeared a brutal ferocity, that could tarni&s;h the mo&s;t heroic valour. In order to intimidate the natives from defending their towns, he, with a bar|barous policy, put every garri&s;on that made any re|&s;i&s;tance to the &s;word.</P>
<P>After his return to England, upon taking his &s;eat, he received the thanks of the hou&s;e, by the mouth of the &s;peaker, for the &s;ervices he had done the
<PB N="226" REF="240">
commonwealth in Ireland. They then proceeded to deliberate upon chu&s;ing a general for conducting the war in Scotland, where they had e&s;pou&s;ed the royal cau&s;e, and placed young Charles, the &s;on of their late monarch, on the throne. Fairfax refu&s;ing this command upon principle, as he had all along declin|ed oppo&s;ing the pre&s;byterians, the command nece&s;&s;a|rily devolved upon Cromwell, who boldly &s;et for|ward for Scotland, at the head of an army of &s;ixteen thou&s;and men.</P>

<P>In this terrible exigence, young Charles embraced a re&s;olution worthy a prince, who was willing to ha|zard all for empire. Ob&s;erving that the way was open to England, he re&s;olved immediately to march into that country, where he expected to be reinforced by all the royali&s;ts in that part of the kingdom.</P>
<P>But he &s;oon found him&s;elf di&s;appointed in the ex|pectation of encrea&s;ing his army. The Scotch, ter|rified at the pro&s;pect of &s;o hazardous an enterprize, fell from him in great numbers. The Engli&s;h, af|frighted at the name of his opponent, dreaded to join him: but his mortifications were &s;till more en|crea&s;ed as he arrived at Worce&s;ter; when informed, that Cromwell was marching with ha&s;ty &s;trides from Scotland, with an army encrea&s;ed to forty thou&s;and men. The news &s;carce arrived, when that active general him&s;elf appeared, and falling upon the town on all &s;ides, broke in upon the di&s;ordered royali&s;ts. The &s;treets were &s;trewed with &s;laughter, the whole Scotch army was either killed or taken pri&s;oners, and
<PB N="227" REF="241">
the king him&s;elf, having given many proofs of per|&s;onal valour, was obliged to &s;ly.</P>
<P>Imagination can &s;carce conceive adventures more romantic, or di&s;tre&s;&s;es more &s;evere, than tho&s;e which attended the young king's e&s;cape from the &s;cene of &s;laughter. After various e&s;capes, and one and forty days concealment, he landed &s;afely at Fe&s;champ in Normandy; no le&s;s than forty men and women having at different times been privy to his e&s;|cape.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Cromwell, crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, returned in triumph to London, where he was met by the &s;peaker of the hou&s;e, accompanied by the mayor of London, and the magi&s;trates, in all their formalities. His fir&s;t care was to take advantage of his late &s;ucce&s;&s;es, by depre&s;&s;ing the Scotch, who had &s;o lately with&s;tood the work of the Go&s;pel, as he called it. An act was pa&s;&s;ed for aboli&s;hing royalty in Scotland, and annexing that kingdom, as a con|quered province, to the Engli&s;h commonwealth. It was impowered, however, to &s;end &s;ome members to the Engli&s;h parliament. Judges were appointed to di&s;tribute ju&s;tice; and the people of that country, now freed from the tyranny of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, were not much di&s;&s;atisfied with their pre&s;ent government. The prudent conduct of Monk, who was left by Cromwell to complete their &s;ubjection, &s;erved much to reconcile the minds of the people, harra&s;&s;ed with di&s;&s;en&s;ions, of which they never well under|&s;tood the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>In this manner the Engli&s;h parliament, by the means of Cromwell, &s;pread their unconte&s;ted autho|rity over all the Briti&s;h dominions. Ireland was to|tally &s;ubdued by Ireton and Ludlow. All the &s;ettle|ments in America, that had declared for the royal cau&s;e, were obliged to &s;ubmit; Jer&s;ey, Guern&s;ey, Scilly, and the I&s;le of Man, were brought ea&s;ily under &s;ubjection. Thus mankind &s;aw, with a&s;ton|i&s;hment,
<PB N="228" REF="242">
a parliament compo&s;ed of &s;ixty or &s;eventy ob&s;cure and illiterate members, governing a great empire with unanimity and &s;ucce&s;s. Without any acknowledged &s;ubordination, except a council of &s;tate con&s;i&s;ting of thirty-eight, to whom all addre&s;&s;es were made, they levied armies, maintained fleets, and gave laws to the neighbouring powers of Eu|rope. The finances were managed with oeconomy and exactne&s;s. Few private per&s;ons became rich by the plunder of the public: the revenues of the crown, the lands of the bi&s;hops, and a tax of an hundred and twenty thou&s;and pounds each month, &s;upplied the wants of the government, and gave vi|gour to all their proceedings.</P>
<P>The parliament, having thus reduced their native dominions to perfect obedience, next re&s;olved to cha&s;ti&s;e the Dutch, who had given but very &s;light cau&s;es of complaint. It happened that one doctor Dori&s;laus, who was of the number of the late king's judges, being &s;ent by the parliament as their envoy to Holland, was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by one of the royal par|ty, who had taken refuge there. Some time after al&s;o, Mr. St. John, appointed their amba&s;&s;ador to that court, was in&s;ulted by the friends of the prince of Orange. The&s;e were thought motives &s;ufficient to induce the commonwealth of England to declare war again&s;t them. The parliament's chief depen|dence lay in the activity and courage of Blake, their admiral; who, though he had not embarked in naval command till late in life, yet &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all that went before him in courage and dexterity. On the other &s;ide, the Dutch oppo&s;ed to him their famous admiral Van Tromp, to whom they never &s;ince pro|duced an equal. Many were the engagements be|tween the&s;e celebrated admirals, and various was their &s;ucce&s;s. Sea-fights, in general, &s;eldom prove deci&s;ive; and the vanqui&s;hed are &s;oon &s;een to make head again&s;t the victors. Several dreadful encoun|ters,
<PB N="229" REF="243">
therefore, rather &s;erved to &s;hew the excellence of the admirals, than to determine their &s;uperiority. The Dutch, however, who felt many great di&s;ad|vantages by the lo&s;s of their trade, and by the total &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of their fi&s;heries, were willing to treat for a peace; but the parliament gave them a very unfavourable an&s;wer. It was the policy of that bo|dy, to keep their navy on foot as long as they could; rightly judging, that while the force of the nation was exerted by &s;ea, it would dimini&s;h the power of general Cromwell by land, which was now become very formidable to them.</P>
<P>This great a&s;pirer, however, quickly perceived their de&s;igns; and from the fir&s;t &s;aw that they dreaded his growing power, and wi&s;hed its diminu|tion. All his mea&s;ures were conducted with a bold intrepidity that marked his character; and he now &s;aw, that it was not nece&s;&s;ary to wear the ma&s;k of &s;ubordination any longer. Secure, therefore, in the attachment of the army, he re&s;olved to make another daring effort; and per&s;uaded the officers to pre&s;ent a petition for payment of arrears and redre&s;s of griev|ances, which he knew would be rejected by the com|mons with di&s;dain. The petition was &s;oon drawn up and pre&s;ented, in which the officers, after de|manding their arrears, de&s;ired the parliament to con|&s;ider how many years they had &s;at;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1653.</NOTE> and what profe&s;&s;ions they had formerly made of their intentions to new model the hou&s;e, and e&s;tabli&s;h freedom on the broade&s;t ba&s;is.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e was highly offended at the pre&s;ump|tion of the army, although they had &s;een, but too lately, that their own power was wholly &s;ounded on that very pre&s;umption. They appointed a commit|tee to prepare an act, ordaining that all per&s;ons who pre&s;ented &s;uch petitions, for the future, &s;hould be deemed guilty of high trea&s;on. To this the officers
<PB N="230" REF="244">
made a very warm remon&s;trance, and the parliament as angry a reply; while the breach between them every moment grew wider. This was what Crom|well had long wi&s;hed, and had long fore&s;een. He was &s;itting in council with his officers, when in|formed of the &s;ubject on which the hou&s;e was deli|berating; upon which he ro&s;e up in the mo&s;t &s;eem|ing fury, and turning to major Vernon, cried out,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he was compelled to do a thing that made the very hair of his head &s;tand on end."</Q>
Then ha&s;tening to the hou&s;e with three hundred &s;oldiers, and with the marks of violent indignation on his countenance he entered. Stamping with his foot, which was the &s;ignal for the &s;oldiers to enter, the place was immediately filled with armed men. Then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the members:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"For &s;hame, &s;aid he, get you gone. Give place to hone&s;ter men; to tho&s;e who will more faithfully di&s;charge their tru&s;t. You are no longer a parliament; I tell you, you are no longer a parliament; the Lord has done with you."</Q>
Sir Harry Vane exclaiming again&s;t this conduct:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sir Harry, cried Cromwell with a loud voice, O Sir Harry Vane, the Lord deliver me from Sir Harry Vane."</Q>
Taking hold of Martin by the cloak, thou art a whore-ma&s;ter; to another, thou art an adulterer; to a third, thou art a drunkard; and to a fourth, thou art a glutton.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is you, continued he to the members, that have forced me upon this. I have &s;ought the Lord night and day, that he would rather &s;lay me than put me upon this work."</Q>
Then pointing to the mace, "Take away, cried he, that bauble." After which, turning out all the members, and clearing the hall, he ordered the doors to be locked, and putting the key in his pocket, returned to White|hall.</P>
<P>The per&s;ons he pitched upon for his next parlia|ment, were the lowe&s;t, meane&s;t, and the mo&s;t igno|rant
<PB N="231" REF="245">
among the citizens, and the very dregs of the fanatics. He was well apprized that during the ad|mini&s;tration of &s;uch a groupe of characters he alone mu&s;t govern, or that they mu&s;t &s;oon throw up the reins of government, which they were unqualified to guide. Accordingly, their practice ju&s;tified his &s;agacity. One of them particularly, who was called Prai&s;e God Barebone, a canting leather &s;eller, gave his name to this odd a&s;&s;embly, and it was called Barebone's parliament.</P>
<P>The very vulgar began now to exclaim again&s;t &s;o fooli&s;h a legi&s;lature; and they them&s;elves &s;eemed not in&s;en&s;ible of the ridicule which every day was thrown out again&s;t them. Accordingly, by concert, they met earlier than the re&s;t of their fraternity; and ob|&s;erving to each other that this parliament had &s;at long enough, they ha&s;tened to Cromwell, with Rou&s;e their &s;peaker at their head, and into his hands they re&s;igned the authority with which he had inve&s;ted them.</P>
<P>Cromwell accepted their re&s;ignation with plea&s;ure; but being told that &s;ome of the number were refrac|tory, he &s;ent colonel White to clear the hou&s;e of &s;uch as ventured to remain there. They had placed one Moyer in the chair by the time that the colonel had arrived; and he being a&s;ked by the colonel, <Q REND="inline">""What they did there?""</Q> Moyer replied very gravely, that they were &s;eeking the Lord.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Then you may go el&s;ewhere, cried White; for to my certain knowledge the Lord has not been here the&s;e many years."</Q></P>
<P>This &s;hadow of a parliament being di&s;&s;olved, the officers, by their own authority, declared Cromwell protector of the commonwealth of England. He was to be addre&s;&s;ed by the title of highne&s;s; and his power was proclaimed in London, and other parts of the kingdom. Thus an ob&s;cure and vulgar man, at the age of fifty-three, ro&s;e to unbounded power, fir&s;t
<PB N="232" REF="246">
by following &s;mall events in his favour, and at length by directing great ones.</P>
<P>Cromwell cho&s;e his council among his officers, who had been the companions of his dangers and his victories, to each of whom he a&s;&s;igned a pen|&s;ion of one thou&s;and pounds a year. He took care to have his troops, upon who&s;e fidelity he depended for &s;upport, paid a month in advance; the maga|zines were al&s;o well provided, and the public trea|&s;ure managed with frugality and care: while his ac|tivity, vigilance, and re&s;olution were &s;uch, that he di&s;covered every con&s;piracy again&s;t his per&s;on, and every plot for an in&s;urrection before they took effect.</P>
<P>His management of foreign affairs, though his &s;chemes were by no means political, yet well cor|re&s;ponded with his character, and, for a while, were attended with &s;ucce&s;s. The Dutch having been humbled by repeated defeats, and totally abridged in their commercial concerns, were obliged at la&s;t to &s;ue for peace, which he gave them upon terms ra|ther too favourable. He in&s;i&s;ted upon their paying deference to the Briti&s;h flag. He compelled them to abandon the intere&s;ts of the king, and to pay eighty-five thou&s;and pounds as an indemnification for former expences, and to re&s;tore the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t India company a part of tho&s;e dominions of which they had been di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Dutch during the former reign, in that di&s;tant part of the world.</P>
<P>He was not le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful in his negotiations with the court of France. Cardinal Mazarine, by whom the affairs of that kingdom were conducted, deemed it nece&s;&s;ary to pay deference to the protector; and de&s;irous rather to prevail by dexterity than violence, &s;ubmitted to Cromwell's imperious character, and thus procured ends equally beneficial to both.</P>
<P>The court of Spain was not le&s;s a&s;&s;iduous in its endeavours to gain his friend&s;hip, but was not &s;o
<PB N="233" REF="247">
&s;ucce&s;sful. This va&s;t monarchy, which but a few years before had threatened the liberties of Europe, was now reduced &s;o low as to be &s;carce able to de|fend it&s;elf. Cromwell, however, who knew nothing of foreign politics, &s;till continued to regard its pow|er with an eye of jealou&s;y, and came into an a&s;&s;oci|ation with France to depre&s;s it &s;till more. He lent that court a body of &s;ix thou&s;and men to attack the Spani&s;h dominions in the Netherlands; and upon obtaining a &s;ignal victory by his a&s;&s;i&s;tance at Dunes, the French put Dunkirk, which they had ju&s;t taken from the Spaniards, into his hands, as a reward for his attachment.</P>
<P>But it was by &s;ea that he humbled the power of Spain with &s;till more effectual &s;ucce&s;s. Blake, who had long made him&s;elf formidable to the Dutch, and who&s;e &s;ame was &s;pread over Europe, now became &s;till more dreadful to the Spani&s;h monarchy. He &s;ailed with a fleet into the Mediterranean, whither, &s;ince the time of the cru&s;ades, no Engli&s;h fleet had ever ventured to advance. He there conquered all that ventured to oppo&s;e him. Ca&s;ting anchor before Leghorn, he demanded and obtained &s;atisfaction for &s;ome injuries which the Engli&s;h commerce had &s;uf|fered from the duke of Tu&s;cany. He next &s;ailed to Algiers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1655.</NOTE> and compelled the Dey to make peace, and to re&s;train his pyratical &s;ubjects from farther injuring the Engli&s;h. He then went to Tunis, and having made the &s;ame demands, he was de&s;ired by the Dey of that place to look at the two ca&s;tles, Porto Farino, and Goletta, and do his utmo&s;t. Blake &s;hewed him that he was not &s;low in accepting the challenge; he en|tered the harbour, burned the &s;hipping there, and then &s;ailed out triumphantly to pur&s;ue his voyage. At Cadiz, he took two galleons valued at near two million pieces of eight. At the Canaries, he burn|ed a Spani&s;h fleet of &s;ixteen &s;hips, and returning
<PB N="234" REF="248">
home to England to enjoy the &s;ame of his noble ac|tions, as he came within &s;ight of his native country he expired. This gallant man, though he &s;ought for an u&s;urper, yet was aver&s;e to his cau&s;e; he was a zealous republican in principle, and his aim was to &s;erve his country, not to e&s;tabli&s;h a tyrant.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is &s;till our duty, he would &s;ay to the &s;ea-men, to fight for our country into whatever hands the go|vernment may fall."</Q></P>
<P>At the &s;ame time that Blake's expeditions were going forward, there was another carried on under the command of admiral Pen and Venables, with a|bout four thou&s;and land forces, to attack the I&s;land of Hi&s;paniola. Failing however, in this, and being driven off the place by the Spaniards, they &s;teered to Jamaica, which was &s;urrendered to them without a blow. So little was thought of the importance of this conque&s;t, that, upon the return of the expedi|tion, Pen and Venables were &s;ent to the Tower, for their failure in the principal object of their expedition.</P>
<P>But it mu&s;t not be &s;uppo&s;ed that Cromwell's &s;ituation was at this time enviable? Perhaps no &s;tation, however mean, or loaded with contempt, could be more truly di&s;tre&s;sful than his, at a time the nation was loading him with congratulations and addre&s;&s;es. He had by this rendered him&s;elf hateful to every par|ty;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1658.</NOTE> and he owed his &s;afety to their mutual hatred and diffidence of each other. His arts of di&s;&s;imulation had been long ex|hau&s;ted; none now could be deceived by them, tho&s;e of his own party and principles di&s;daining the u&s;e to which he had converted his zeal and pro|fe&s;&s;ions. The truth &s;eems to be, if we may u&s;e a phra&s;e taken from common life, he had began with being a dupe to his own enthu&s;ia&s;ms, and ended with being a &s;harper.</P>
<P>The whole nation &s;ilently dete&s;ted his admini&s;tra|tion, but he had not &s;till been reduced to the ex|treme
<PB N="235" REF="249">
of wretchedne&s;s, if he could have found dome&s;tic con&s;olation. Fleetwood, his &s;on-in law, actuated with the wilde&s;t zeal, dete&s;ted that character which could u&s;e religious profe&s;&s;ions for the purpo&s;es of temporal advancement. His elde&s;t daughter, married to Fleet|wood, had adopted republican principles &s;o vehe|mently, that &s;he could not behold even her own fa|ther entru&s;ted with uncontrolable power. His other daughters were no le&s;s &s;anguine in favour of the royal cau&s;e; but above all, Mrs. Claypole, his fa|vourite daughter, who, upon her death-bed, up|braided him with all tho&s;e crimes that led him to trample on the throne.</P>
<P>Every hour added &s;ome new di&s;quietude. Lord Fairfax, Sir William Waller, and many of the heads of the pre&s;byterians, had &s;ecretly entered into an engagement to de&s;troy him. His admini&s;tration, &s;o expen&s;ive both at home and abroad, had exhau&s;ted his revenue, and he was left con&s;iderably in debt. One con&s;piracy was no &s;ooner detected, but another ro&s;e from its ruins; and to encrea&s;e his calamity, he was now taught, upon rea&s;oning principles, that his death was not only de&s;irable, but his a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination would be meritorious. A book was publi&s;hed by colonel Titus, a man who had formerly been attach|ed to his cau&s;e, entitled, <HI>Killing no Murder.</HI> Of all the pamphlets that came forth at that time, or per|haps of tho&s;e that have &s;ince appeared, this was the mo&s;t eloquent and ma&s;terly. "Shall we, &s;aid this po|pular declaimer, who would not &s;uffer the lion to in|vade us, tamely &s;tand to be devoured by the wolf." Cromwell read this &s;pirited treati&s;e, and was never &s;een to &s;mile more.</P>
<P>All peace was now for ever bani&s;hed from his mind. He now found, that the grandeur to which he had &s;acrificed his former peace, was only an inlet to fre&s;h inquietudes. The fears of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination haunted him in all his walks, and was perpetually
<PB N="236" REF="250">
pre&s;ent to his imagination. He wore armour under his cloaths, and always kept pi&s;tols in his pockets. His a&s;pect was clouded by a &s;ettled gloom; and he regarded every &s;tranger with a glance of timid &s;u&s;pi|cion. He always travelled with hurry, and was ever attended by a numerous guard. He never returned from any place by the road he went; and &s;eldom &s;lept above three nights together in the &s;ame cham|ber. Society terrified him, as there he might meet an enemy; &s;olitude was terrible, as he was there unguarded by every friend.</P>
<P>A tertian ague kindly came at la&s;t to deliver him from this life of horror and anxiety. For the &s;pace of a week no dangerous &s;ymptoms appeared; and in the intervals of the fits he was able to walk abroad. At length the fever encrea&s;ed, and he became deli|rious. He was ju&s;t able to an&s;wer yes, to the de|mand, whether his &s;on Richard &s;hould be appointed to &s;ucceed him. He died on the third day of Sep|tember,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1658.</NOTE> that very day which he had al|ways con&s;idered as the mo&s;t fortunate of his life; he was then fifty-nine years old, and had u&s;urped the government nine years.</P>
<P>Whatever might have been the differences of in|tere&s;t after the death of the u&s;urper, the influence of his name was &s;till &s;ufficient to get Richard his &s;on proclaimed protector in his room. But the army, di&s;contented with &s;uch a leader, e&s;tabli&s;hed a meeting at general Fleetwood's, which, as he dwelt in Wal|lingford-hou&s;e, was called the Cabal of Walling|ford. The re&s;ult of their deliberations was a re|mon&s;trance that the command of the army &s;hould be entru&s;ted to &s;ome per&s;on in whom they might all confide; and it was plainly given to under&s;tand, that the young protector was not that per&s;on.</P>
<P>Richard wanted re&s;olution to defend the title that had been conferred upon him; he &s;oon &s;igned his own
<PB N="237" REF="251">
abdication in form, and retired to live &s;everal years after his re&s;ignation, at fir&s;t on the continent, and afterwards upon his paternal fortune at home. He was thought by the ignorant to be unworthy of the happine&s;s of his exaltation; but he knew by his tran|quility in private, that he had made the mo&s;t fortu|nate e&s;cape.</P>
<P>The officers being once more left to them&s;elves, determined to replace the remnant of the old parlia|ment which had beheaded the king, and which Cromwell had &s;o di&s;gracefully turned out of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The Rump parliament, for that was the name it went by, being now rein&s;tated, was yet very vigo|rous in its attempts to le&s;&s;en the power by which it was replaced. The officers of the army therefore came to a re&s;olution, u&s;ual enough in the&s;e times, to di&s;&s;olve that a&s;&s;embly, by which they were &s;o vehe|mently oppo&s;ed. Accordingly Lambert, one of the generals, drew up a cho&s;en body of troops; and placing them in the &s;treets which led to We&s;tmin&s;ter|hall, when the &s;peaker, Lenthall, proceeded in his carriage to the hou&s;e, he ordered the hor&s;es to be turned, and very civily conducted him home. The other members were likewi&s;e intercepted, and the army returned to their quarters to ob&s;erve a &s;olemn fa&s;t, which generally either proceeded, or attended their outrages.</P>
<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, general Monk was at the head of eight thou&s;and veterans in Scotland, and beheld the di&s;traction of his native country, with but &s;lender hopes of relieving it.</P>
<P>Whatever might have been his de&s;igns, it was im|po&s;&s;ible to cover them with greater &s;ecrecy than he did. As &s;oon as he put his army into motion, to enquire into the cau&s;es of the di&s;turbances in the ca|pital, his countenance was eagerly &s;ought by all the contending parties. He &s;till however continued to
<PB N="238" REF="252">
march his army towards the capital; all the world equally in doubt as to his motives, and a&s;toni&s;hed at his re&s;erve. But Monk continued his inflexible taci|turnity, and at la&s;t came to St. Alban's, within a few miles of London.</P>
<P>He there &s;ent the Rump parliament, who had re|&s;umed their &s;eats, a me&s;&s;age, de&s;iring them to re|move &s;uch forces as remained in London to country quarters. In the mean time the Hou&s;e of commons having pa&s;&s;ed votes for the compo&s;ure of the king|dom, di&s;&s;olved them&s;elves, and gave orders for the immediate a&s;&s;embling a new parliament.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1660.</NOTE>As yet the new parliament was not a&s;|&s;embled, and no per&s;on had hitherto dived into the de&s;igns of the general. He &s;till per&s;evered in his re&s;erve; and although the calling a new parliament was but, in other words, to re&s;tore the king, yet his expre&s;&s;ions never once be|trayed the &s;ecret of his bo&s;om. Nothing but a &s;ecu|rity of confidence at la&s;t extorted the confe&s;&s;ion from him. He had been intimate with one Morrice, a gentleman of Devon&s;hire, of a &s;edentary &s;tudious di&s;po&s;ition, and with him alone did he deliberate up|on the great and dangerous enterprize of the re&s;to|ration. Sir John Granville, who had a commi&s;&s;ion from the king, applied for acce&s;s to the general; he he was de&s;ired to communicate his bu&s;ine&s;s to Morrice. Granville refu&s;ed, though twice urged, to deliver his me&s;&s;age to any but the general him&s;elf; &s;o that Monk now finding he could depend upon this mini&s;ter's &s;ecrecy, he opened to him his whole in|tentions; but with his u&s;ual caution &s;till &s;crupled to commit any thing to paper. In con&s;equence of the&s;e the king left the Spani&s;h territories, where he very narrowly e&s;caped being detained at Breda by the go|vernor, under pretence of treating him with proper re&s;pect and formality. From thence he retired into Holland, where he re&s;olved to wait for further advice.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="253">At length the long expected day for the &s;itting of a free parliament arrived. The affections of all were turned towards the king; yet &s;uch were their fears, and &s;uch dangers attended a freedom of &s;peech, that no one dared for &s;ome days to make any mention of his name. All this time Monk, with his u&s;ual re|&s;erve, tried their tempers, and examined the ardour of their wi&s;hes; at length he gave directions to An|ne&s;ley, pre&s;ident of the council, to inform them that one Sir John Granville, a &s;ervant of the king, had been &s;ent over by his maje&s;ty, and was now at the door with a letter to the commons.</P>
<P>Nothing could exceed the joy and tran&s;port with which this me&s;&s;age was received. The members for a moment forgot the dignity of their &s;ituations, and indulged in a loud exclamation of applau&s;e. Gran|ville was called in, and the letter eagerly read. A moment's pau&s;e was &s;carce allowed; all at once the hou&s;e bur&s;t out into an univer&s;al a&s;&s;ent at the king's propo&s;als; and to diffu&s;e the joy more widely, it was voted that the letter and indemnity &s;hould immedi|ately be publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>Charles II. entered London on the twenty-ninth of May, which was his birth-day. An innumerable concour&s;e of people lined the way wherever he pa&s;|&s;ed, and rent the air with their acclamations. They had been &s;o long di&s;tracted by unrelenting factions, oppre&s;&s;ed and alarmed by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of tyrannies, that they could no longer &s;uppre&s;s the&s;e emotions of delight to behold their con&s;titution re&s;tored; or ra|ther, like a phoenix, appearing more beautiful and vigorous from the ruins of its former conflagration.</P>
<P>Fanatici&s;m, with its long train of gloomy terrors, fled at the approach of freedom; the arts of &s;ociety and peace began to return; and it had been happy for the people if the arts of luxury had not entered in their train.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXX. CHARLES II.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Charles came to the throne he was thirty years of age, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an agreeable per&s;on, an elegant addre&s;s, and an engaging manner. His whole demeanour and behaviour was well calculated to &s;upport and encrea&s;e popularity. Accu&s;tomed du|ring his exile, to live chearfully among his courtiers, he carried the &s;ame endearing familiarities to the throne, and from the levity of his temper&punc; no inju|ries were dreaded from his former re&s;entments. But it was &s;oon found that all the&s;e advantages were merely &s;uperficial. His indolence and love of plea|&s;ure made him aver&s;e to all kinds of bu&s;ine&s;s; his familiarities were pro&s;tituted to the wor&s;t as well as the be&s;t of his &s;ubjects; and he took no care to re|ward his former friends, as he had taken few &s;teps to be avenged of his former enemies.</P>
<P>Though an act of indemnity was pa&s;&s;ed, tho&s;e who had an immediate hand in the king's death were excepted. Cromwell, Ireton, and Brad&s;haw, though dead, were con&s;idered as proper objects of re&s;ent|ment; their bodies were dug from their graves, dragged to the place of execution, and, after hang|ing &s;ome time, buried under the gallows. Of the re&s;t, who &s;at in judgment on the late monarch's tri|al, &s;ome were dead, and &s;ome were thought worthy of pardon. Ten only, out of four&s;core, were de|voted to immediate de&s;truction. The&s;e were enthu|&s;ia&s;ts, who had all along acted from principle, and who, in the general &s;pirit of rage excited again&s;t them, &s;hewed a fortitude that might do honour to a better cau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="255">This was the time for the king to have made him|&s;elf independent of all parliaments; and it is &s;aid that Southampton, one of his mini&s;ters, had thought of procuring his ma&s;ter from the commons the grant of a revenue of two millions a year, which would effectually render him ab&s;olute; but in this his views were ob&s;tructed by the great Clarendon, who, tho' attached to the king, was &s;till more the friend of li|berty and the laws. Charles, however, was no way intere&s;ted in the&s;e oppo&s;ite views of his mini&s;ters; he only de&s;ired money, in order to pro&s;ecute his plea&s;ures; and provided he had that, he little regard|ed the manner in which it was obtained.</P>
<P>His continual exigencies drove him con&s;tantly to mea&s;ures no way &s;uited to his inclination. Among others, was his marriage, celebrated at this time with Catharine, the Infanta of Portugal, who, though a virtuous prince&s;s, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as it &s;hould &s;eem but few per&s;onal attractions. It was the portion of this prin|ce&s;s that the needy monarch was enamoured of, which amounted to three hundred thou&s;and pounds, together with the fortre&s;s of Tangier in Africa, and of Bombay in the Ea&s;t Indies. The chancellor Cla|rendon, the dukes of Ormond and Southampton, urged many rea&s;ons again&s;t this match, particularly the likelihood of her never having any children; the king di&s;regarded their advice, and the inau&s;picious marriage was celebrated accordingly.</P>
<P>It was probably with a view of recruiting the &s;up|ply for his plea&s;ures, that he was induced to declare war again&s;t the Dutch, as the money appointed for that purpo&s;e would go thro' his hands. In this naval war, which continued to rage for &s;ome years, with great fiercene&s;s, much blood was &s;pilt, and great trea&s;ures exhau&s;ted, until at la&s;t a treaty was concluded at Breda, by which the colony of New York was ceded by the Dutch to the Engli&s;h, and has continued a mo&s;t va|luable acqui&s;ition to the pre&s;ent time.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="256">This treaty was con&s;idered as inglorious to the Engli&s;h, as they failed in gaining any redre&s;s upon the complaints which gave ri&s;e to it. Lord Claren|don, particularly, gained a &s;hare of blame, both for having fir&s;t advi&s;ed an unnece&s;&s;ary war, and then for concluding a di&s;graceful peace. He had been long declining in the king's favour, and he was no le&s;s di&s;plea&s;ing to the majority of the people.</P>
<P>This &s;eemed the &s;ignal for the earl's enemies to &s;tep in, and effect his entire overthrow. A charge was opened again&s;t him in the hou&s;e of commons by Mr. Seymour, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;eventeen articles. The&s;e, which were only a catalogue of the popular rumours before-mentioned, appeared at fir&s;t &s;ight fal&s;e or fri|volous. However, Clarendon finding the popular tor|rent, united to the violence of power, running with impetuo&s;ity again&s;t him, thought proper to withdraw to France.</P>
<P>Having thus got rid of his virtuous mini&s;ter, the king &s;oon after re&s;igned him&s;elf to the direction of a &s;et of men who afterwards went by the appellation of the Cabal, from the initials of the names of which it was compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of them, Sir Thomas Clifford, was a man of a daring and impetuous &s;pirit, rendered more dangerous by eloquence and intrigue. Lord A&s;hley, &s;oon after known by the name of lord Shaf|te&s;bury, was turbulent, ambitious, &s;ubtle, and en|terpri&s;ing. The duke of Buckingham was gay, ca|pricious, of &s;ome wit, and great vivacity. Arling|ton was a man but of very moderate capacity, his intentions were good, but he wanted courage to per|&s;evere in them. La&s;tly, the duke of Lauderdale, who was not defective in natural, and &s;till le&s;s in ac|quired talents; but neither was his addre&s;s graceful, nor his under&s;tanding ju&s;t; he was ambitious, ob|&s;tinate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1670.</NOTE> in&s;olent, and &s;ullen. The&s;e were the men to whom Charles gave up the conduct of his affairs, and who plunged
<PB N="243" REF="257">
the remaining part of his reign in diffi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ulties, which produced the mo&s;t dangerous &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>From this inau&s;picious combination the people had entertained violent jealou&s;ies again&s;t the court. The fears and di&s;contents of the nation were vented with|out re&s;traint; the apprehen&s;ions of a popi&s;h &s;ucce&s;|&s;or, an abandoned court, and a parliament which, though &s;ometimes a&s;&s;ertors of liberty, yet which had now continued for &s;eventeen years without change, naturally rendered the minds of mankind timid and &s;u&s;picious, and they only wanted objects on which to wreak their ill humour.</P>
<P>When the &s;pirit of the Engli&s;h is once rou&s;ed, they either find objects of &s;u&s;picion or make them. On the twelfth of Augu&s;t, one Kirby, a chemi&s;t, acco&s;ted the king as he was walking in the Park.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sir, &s;aid he, keep within the company, your ene|mies have a de&s;ign upon your life, and you may be &s;hot in this very walk."</Q>
Being que&s;tioned in con&s;equence of this &s;trange intimation, he offered to produce one doctor Tongue, a weak credulous cler|gyman, who had told him, that two per&s;ons, named Grove and Pickering, were engaged to murder the king; and that Sir George Wakeman, the queen's phy&s;ician, had undertaken the &s;ame ta&s;k by poi&s;on. Tongue was introduced to the king with a bundle of papers relating to this pretended con&s;piracy, and was referred to the lord trea&s;urer Danby. He there de|clared that the papers were thru&s;t under his door; and he afterwards declared, that he knew the author of them, who de&s;ired that his name might be con|cealed, as he dreaded the re&s;entment of the Je|&s;uits.</P>
<P>This information appeared &s;o vague and un&s;atis|factory, that the king concluded the whole was a fiction. However, Tongue was not to be repre&s;&s;ed in the ardour of his loyalty; he went again to the lord trea&s;urer, and told him, that a pacquet of let|ters,
<PB N="244" REF="258">
written by Je&s;uits concerned in the plot, was that night to be put into the po&s;t-hou&s;e for Wind&s;or, directed to one Bedingfield, a Je&s;uit, who was con|fe&s;&s;or to the duke of York, and who re&s;ided there. The&s;e letters had actually been received a few hours before by the duke; but he had &s;hewn them to the king as a forgery, of which he neither knew the drift nor the meaning.</P>
<P>Titus Oates, who was the fountain of all this dreadful intelligence, was produced &s;oon after, who, with &s;eeming reluctance, came to give his evidence. This Titus Oates was an abandoned mi&s;creant, ob|&s;cure, illiterate, vulgar, and indigent. He had been once indicted for perjury, was afterwards chaplain on board a man of war, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed for unnatural practices. He then profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a Roman ca|tholic, and cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea to St. Omer's, where he was for &s;ome time maintained in the Engli&s;h &s;emina|ry of that city. At a time that he was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been entru&s;ted with a &s;ecret involving the fate of kings, he was allowed to remain in &s;uch nece&s;&s;i|ty, that Kirby was obliged to &s;upply him with daily bread.</P>
<P>He had two methods to proceed, either to ingra|tiate him&s;elf by this information with the mini&s;try, or to alarm the people, and thus turn their fears to his advantage. He cho&s;e the latter method. He went, therefore, with his two companions to Sir Ed|mond&s;bury Godfrey, a noted and active ju&s;tice of peace, and before him depo&s;ed to a narrative dre&s;&s;ed up in terrors fit to make an impre&s;&s;ion on the vulgar. The pope, he &s;aid, con&s;idered him&s;elf as entitled to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of England and Ireland, on account of the here&s;y of the prince and people, and had accord|ingly a&s;&s;umed the &s;overeignty of the&s;e kingdoms. The king, whom the Je&s;uits called the Black Ba&s;tard, was &s;olemnly tried by them, and condemned as an heretic. Grove and Pickering, to make &s;ure work,
<PB N="245" REF="259">
were employed to &s;hoot the king, and that too with &s;ilver bullets. The duke of York was to be offered the crown in con&s;equence of the &s;ucce&s;s of the&s;e probable &s;chemes, on condition of extirpating the prote&s;tant religion. Upon his refu&s;al,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"To pot James mu&s;t go,"</Q>
as the Je&s;uits were &s;aid to ex|pre&s;s it.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this dreadful information, &s;uf|ficiently marked with ab&s;urdity, vulgarity, and con|tradiction, Titus Oates became the favourite of the people, notwith&s;tanding during his examination be|fore the council, he &s;o betrayed the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of his impo&s;tures, that he contradicted him&s;elf in every &s;tep of his narration.</P>
<P>A great number of the Je&s;uits mentioned by Oates were immediately taken into cu&s;tody. Coleman, &s;e|cretary to the duke of York, who was &s;aid to have acted &s;o &s;trenuous a part in the con&s;piracy, at fir&s;t retired; but next day &s;urrendered him&s;elf to the &s;e|cretary of &s;tate, and &s;ome of his papers, by Oates's directions, were &s;ecured.</P>
<P>In this fluctuation of pa&s;&s;ions, an accident &s;erved to confirm the prejudices of the people, and to put it beyond a doubt that Oates's narrative was nothing but the truth. Sir Edmond&s;bury Godfrey, who had been &s;o active in unravelling the whole mi&s;tery of the popi&s;h machinations, after having been mi&s;&s;ing &s;ome days, was found dead in a ditch by Primro&s;e-hill in the way to Hamp&s;tead. The cau&s;e of his death re|mains, and mu&s;t &s;till continue, a &s;ecret; but the peo|ple, already enraged again&s;t the papi&s;ts, did not he&s;i|tate a moment to a&s;cribe it to them. The body of Godfrey was carried through the &s;treets in proce&s;&s;ion, preceded by &s;eventy clergymen; and every one who &s;aw it made no doubt that his death could be only cau&s;ed by the papi&s;ts. Even the better &s;ort of people were infected with this vulgar prejudice; and &s;uch was the general conviction of popi&s;h guilt, that no
<PB N="246" REF="260">
per&s;on, with any regard to per&s;onal &s;afety, could ex|pre&s;s the lea&s;t doubt concerning the information of Oates, or the murder of Godfrey.</P>
<P>In order to continue and propagate the alarm, the parliament affected to believe it true. An addre&s;s was voted for a &s;olemn fa&s;t. It was reque&s;ted that all pa|pers tending to throw light upon &s;o horrible a con|&s;piracy might be laid before the hou&s;e, that all papi&s;ts &s;hould remove from London, that acce&s;s &s;hould be denied at court to all unknown and &s;u&s;picious per&s;ons, and that the train-bands in London and We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;hould be in readine&s;s to march. Oates was recom|mended by parliament to the king. He was lodged in Whitehall, and encouraged by a pen&s;ion of twelve hundred pounds a year to proceed in forging new in|formations.</P>
<P>The encouragement given to Oates did not fail to bring in others al&s;o, who hoped to profit by the delu|&s;ion of the times. William Bedloe, a man, if po&s;&s;ible, more infamous than Oates, appeared next upon the &s;tage. He was, like the former, of very low birth, had been noted for &s;everal cheats and thefts. This man, at his own de&s;ire, was arre&s;ted at Bri&s;tol, and conveyed to London, where he declared before the council that he had &s;een the body of Sir Edmon&s;bury Godfrey at Somer&s;et-hou&s;e, where the queen lived. He &s;aid that a &s;ervant of lord Bella&s;is offered to give him four thou&s;and pounds if he would carry it off, and finding all his information greedily received, he confimed and heightened Oates's plot with aggravated horrors.</P>
<P>Thus encouraged by the general voice in their fa|vour, the witne&s;&s;es, who all along had enlarged their narratives, in proportion as they were eagerly receiv|ed, went a &s;tep farther, and ventured to accu&s;e the queen. The commons, in an addre&s;s to the king, gave countenance to this &s;candalous accu&s;ation; the lords rejected it with becoming di&s;dain.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="261">Edward Coleman, &s;ecretary to the duke of York, was the fir&s;t who was brought to trial, as being mo&s;t obnoxious to tho&s;e who pretended to fear the intro|duction of popery. Bedloe &s;wore that he had re|ceived a commi&s;&s;ion, &s;igned by the &s;uperior of the Je&s;uits, appointing him papal &s;ecretary of &s;tate, and that he had con&s;ented to the king's a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. Af|ter this unfortunate man's &s;entence, thus procured by the&s;e vipers, many members of both hou&s;es offer|ed to interpo&s;e in his behalf, if he would make an ample confe&s;&s;ion; but as he was, in reality, po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed of no trea&s;onable &s;ecrets, he would not procure life by fal&s;ehood and impo&s;ture. He &s;uffered with calmne&s;s and con&s;tancy, and to the la&s;t per&s;i&s;ted in the &s;tronge&s;t prote&s;tations of his innocence.</P>
<P>The trial of Coleman was &s;ucceeded by tho&s;e of Ireland, Pickering, and Grove. They prote&s;ted their innocence, but were &s;ound guilty. The&s;e unhappy men went to execution, prote&s;ting their innocence, a circum&s;tance which made no impre&s;&s;ion on the &s;pectators; their being Je&s;uits bani&s;hed even pity from their &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>Hill, Green, and Berry, were tried upon the evi|dence of one Miles Prance, for the murder of God|frey, but though Bedloe's narrative, and Prance's in|formation, were totally irreconcileable, and though their te&s;timony was invalidated by contrary evidence, all was in vain, the pri&s;oners were condemned and executed. They all denied their guilt at execution; and as Berry died a prote&s;tant, this circum&s;tance was regarded as very con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Whitebread, provincial of the Je&s;ui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, Fenwick, Gavan, Turner, and Harcourt, all of them of the &s;ame order, were brought to their trial; and Lang|horne &s;oon after. Be&s;ides Oates and Bedloe, Dug|dale, a new witne&s;s, appeared again&s;t the pri&s;oners. This man &s;pread the alarm &s;till farther, and even a&s;&s;erted, that two hundred thou&s;and papi&s;ts in
<PB N="248" REF="262">
England were ready to take arms. The pri&s;oners proved, by &s;ixteen witne&s;&s;es from St. Omers, that Oates was in that &s;eminary at the time he &s;wore he was in London. But as they were papi&s;ts, their te&s;timony could gain no manner of credit. All pleas availed them nothing; both the Je&s;uits and Lang|borne were condemned and executed, with their la&s;t breath denying the crimes for which they died.</P>
<P>The informers had le&s;s &s;ucce&s;s on the trial of Sir George Wakeman, the queen's phy&s;ician, who, tho' they &s;wore with their u&s;ual animo&s;ity, was acquitted. His condemnation would have involved the queen in his guilt; and it is probable the judge and jury were afraid of venturing &s;o far.</P>
<P>The earl of Stafford, near two years after, was the la&s;t man that fell a &s;acrifice to the&s;e bloody wretches; the witne&s;&s;es produced again&s;t him were Oates, Dugdale, and Tuberville. Oates &s;wore that he &s;aw Fenwick, the Je&s;uit, deliver Stafford a com|mi&s;&s;ion from the general of the Je&s;uits, con&s;tituting him pay-ma&s;ter of the papal army. The clamour and outrage of the populace again&s;t the pri&s;oner was very great; he was found guilty, and condemned to be hanged and quartered; but the king changed the &s;entence into that of beheading. He was executed on Tower-hill, where even his per&s;ecutors could not forbear &s;hedding tears at that &s;erene fortitude which &s;hone in every feature, motion, and accent of this aged nobleman.</P>
<P>This parliament having continued to &s;it for &s;even|teen years without interruption, wherefore a new one was called, in which was pa&s;&s;ed the celebrated &s;tatute, called the Habeas Corpus act, which con|firms the &s;ubject in an ab&s;olute &s;ecurity from op|pre&s;&s;ive power. By this act it was prohibited to &s;end any one to pri&s;ons beyond the &s;ea: no judge, under &s;evere penalties, was to refu&s;e to any pri&s;oner his writ of habeas corpus; by which the goaler was
<PB N="249" REF="263">
to produce in court the body of the pri&s;oner, whence the writ had its name, and to certify the cau&s;e of his detainer and impri&s;onment. If the goal lie with|in twenty miles of the judge, the writ mu&s;t be obeyed in three days, and &s;o proportionably for grea|ter di&s;tances. Every pri&s;oner mu&s;t be indicted the fir&s;t term of his commitment, and brought to trial the &s;ub&s;equent term. And no man after being en|larged by court, can be recommitted for the &s;ame offence.</P>
<P>The Meal-Tub Plot, as it was called, &s;oon follow|ed the former. One Dangerfield, more infamous, if po&s;&s;ible, than Oates and Bedloe, a wretch who had been &s;et in the pillory, &s;courged, branded, and tran&s;ported for felony and coming, hatched a plot in conjunction with a midwife, who&s;e name was Cel|lier, a Roman catholic, of abandoned character. Dangerfield began by declaring, that there was a de|&s;ign on foot to &s;et up a new form of government, and remove the king and the royal family. He com|municated this intelligence to the king and the duke of York, who &s;upplied him with money, and coun|tenanced his di&s;covery. He hid &s;ome &s;editious pa|pers in the lodgings of one colonel Man&s;el; and then brought the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers to his apartment, to &s;earch for &s;muggled merchandize. The papers were found, and the council having examined the affair, concluded they were &s;orged by Dangerfield. They ordered all the places he frequented to be &s;earched; and in the hou&s;e of Cellier, the whole &s;cheme of the con&s;piracy was di&s;covered upon paper, concealed in a meal-tub, from whence the plot had its name. Dangerfield being committed to Newgate, made an ample confe&s;&s;ion of the forgery, which, though probably entirely of his own contrivance, he a&s;cribed to the earl of Ca&s;tlemain, the counte&s;s of Powis, and the five lords in the Tower. He &s;aid that the de&s;ign was to &s;uborn witne&s;&s;es to prove a
<PB N="250" REF="264">
charge of &s;odomy and perjury upon Oates, to a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inate the earl of Shafte&s;bury, to accu&s;e the dukes of Monmouth and Buckingham, the earls of E&s;&s;ex, Hallifax and others, of having been concerned in the con&s;piracy again&s;t the king and his brother. Upon this information, the earl of Ca&s;tlemain and the counte&s;s of Powis were &s;ent to the Tower, and the king him&s;elf was &s;u&s;pected of encouraging this impo&s;ture.</P>
<P>The chief point which the pre&s;ent hou&s;e of com|mons laboured to obtain, was the <HI>Exclu&s;ion Bill,</HI> which, though the former hou&s;e had voted, was ne|ver pa&s;&s;ed into a law. Shafte&s;bury, and many con|&s;iderable men of the party, had rendered them&s;elves &s;o obnoxious to the duke of York, that they could find &s;afety in no mea&s;ure but his ruin. Monmouth's friends hoped that the exclu&s;ion of James would make room for their own patron. The duke of York's profe&s;&s;ed bigotry to the catholic &s;uper&s;tition influenced numbers; and his tyrannies, which were practi&s;ed without controul, while he contined in Scotland, rendered his name odious to thou&s;ands. In a week, therefore, after the commencement of the &s;e&s;&s;ions, a motion was made for bringing in a bill, for excluding him from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne; and a committee was appointed for that purpo&s;e. The debates were carried on with great violence on both &s;ides. The king was pre&s;ent dur|ing the whole debate; and had the plea&s;ure of &s;ee|ing the bill thrown out by a very great majority.</P>
<P>Each party had now for &s;ome time reviled and ridi|culed each other in pamphlets and libels; and this practice, at la&s;t, was attended with an incident that de&s;erves notice. One Fitzharris, an Iri&s;h papi&s;t, de|pendent on the dutche&s;s of Port&s;mouth, one of the king's mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, u&s;ed to &s;upply her with the&s;e occa|&s;ional publications. But he was re&s;olved to add to their number by his own endeavours; and employed
<PB N="251" REF="265">
one Everhard, a Scotchman, to write a libel again&s;t the king and the duke of York. The Scot was ac|tually a &s;py for the oppo&s;ite party; and &s;uppo&s;ing this a trick to entrap him, he di&s;covered the whole to Sir William Waller, an eminent ju&s;tice of peace; and to convince him of the truth of his information, po&s;ted him, and two other per&s;ons, privately, where they heard the whole conference between Fitzharris and him&s;elf. The libel compo&s;ed between them was replete with the utmo&s;t rancour and &s;currility. Wal|ler carried the intelligence to the king, and obtained a warrant for committing Fitzharris, who happened at that very time to have a copy of the libel in his pocket. Seeing him&s;elf in the hands of a party, from which he expected no mercy, he re&s;olved to &s;ide with them, and throw the odium of the libel upon the court, who, he &s;aid, were willing to draw up a libel, which &s;hould be imputed to the exclu|&s;ioners, and thus render them hateful to the people. He enhanced his &s;ervices with the country party, by a new popi&s;h plot, &s;till more tremendous than any of the foregoing. He brought in the duke of York as a principal accomplice in this plot, and as a contriver in the murder of Sir Edmond&s;bury God|frey.</P>
<P>The king impri&s;oned Fitzharris; the commons avowed his cau&s;e. They voted that he &s;hould be impeached by them&s;elves, to &s;creen him from the ordinary forms of ju&s;tice; the lords rejected the impeachment; the commons a&s;&s;erted their right; a commotion was likely to en&s;ue; and the king, to break off the conte&s;t, went to the hou&s;e, and di&s;|&s;olved the parliament, with a fixed re&s;olution never to call another.</P>
<P>This vigorous mea&s;ure was a blow that the parlia|ment had never expected; and nothing but the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of the times could have ju&s;tified the king's manner of proceeding. From that moment, which
<PB N="252" REF="266">
ended the parliamentary commotions, Charles &s;eemed to rule with de&s;potic power; and he was re&s;olved to leave the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to his brother, but clogged with all the faults and misfortunes of his own admini&s;tra|tion. His temper, which had always been ea&s;y and merciful, now became arbitrary, and even cruel; he entertained &s;pies and informers round the throne, and impri&s;oned all &s;uch as he thought mo&s;t daring in their de&s;igns.</P>
<P>He re&s;olved to humble the pre&s;byterians; the&s;e were dive&s;ted of their employments and their places; and their offices given to &s;uch as held with the court, and approved the doctrine of non-re&s;i&s;tance. The clergy began to te&s;tify their zeal and their principles by their writings and their &s;ermons; but though among the&s;e the partizans of the king were the mo&s;t numerous, tho&s;e of the oppo&s;ite faction were the mo&s;t enterprizing. The king openly e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of the former; and thus placing him&s;elf at the head of a faction, he deprived the city of London, which had long headed the popular party, of their charter. It was not till after an abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion that he re&s;tored it to them, having previou&s;ly &s;ub|jected the election of their magi&s;trates to his imme|diate authority.</P>
<P>Terrors al&s;o were not wanting to confirm his new &s;pecies of monarchy. Fitzharris was brought to his trial before a jury, and condemned and executed. The whole gang of &s;pies, witne&s;&s;es, informers, &s;ub|orners, which had long been encouraged and &s;up|ported by the leading patriots, finding now that the king was entirely ma&s;ter, turned &s;hort upon their an|cient drivers, and offered their evidence again&s;t tho&s;e who had fir&s;t put them in motion. The king's mi|ni&s;ters, with an horrid &s;atisfaction, gave them coun|tenance and encouragement: &s;o that &s;oon the &s;ame cruelties, and the &s;ame inju&s;tice, was practi&s;ed again&s;t
<PB N="253" REF="267">
pre&s;byterian &s;chemes, that had been employed again&s;t catholic trea&s;ons.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t per&s;on that fell under the di&s;plea&s;ure of the mini&s;try was one Stephen College, a London joiner, who had become &s;o noted for his zeal again&s;t popery, that he went by the name of the Prote&s;tant Joiner. He had attended the city members to Ox|ford, armed with &s;word and pi&s;tol; he had &s;ometimes been heard to &s;peak irreverently of the king, and was now pre&s;ented by the grand jury of London as guilty of &s;edition. A jury at Oxford, after half an hour's deliberation, brought him in guilty, and the &s;pectators te&s;tified their inhuman plea&s;ure with a &s;hout of applau&s;e. He bore his fate with un&s;haken fortitude; and at the place of execution denied the crime for which he had been condemned.</P>
<P>The power of the crown by this time became irre&s;i&s;tible,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1683.</NOTE> the city of London having been deprived of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ir charter, which was re&s;tored only upon terms of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and the giving up the nomination of their own magi&s;trates was &s;o mortifying a circum&s;tance, that all the other corporations in England &s;oon began to fear the &s;ame treatment, and were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in|duced to &s;urrender their charters into the hands of the king. Con&s;iderable &s;ums were exacted for re|&s;toring the&s;e charters; and all the offices of power and profit were left at the di&s;po&s;al of the crown. Re|&s;i&s;tance now, however ju&s;tifiable, could not be &s;afe; and all prudent men &s;aw no other expedient, but peaceably &s;ubmitting to the pre&s;ent grievances. But there was a party in England that &s;till cheri&s;hed their former ideas of freedom, and were re&s;olved to hazard every danger in its defence.</P>
<P>The duke of Monmouth, the king's natural &s;on by Mrs. Waters, engaged the earl of Macclesfield, lord Brandon, &s;ir Gilbert Gerrard, and other gen|tlemen in Che&s;hire in his cau&s;e. Lord Ru&s;&s;el fixed
<PB N="254" REF="268">
a corre&s;pondence with Sir William Courtney, Sir Francis Rowles, and Sir Francis Drake, who pro|mi&s;ed to rai&s;e the We&s;t. Shafte&s;bury, with one Fergu&s;on, an independent clergyman, and a re&s;tle&s;s plotter, managed the city, upon which the confede|rates chiefly relied. It was now that this turbulent man found his &s;chemes mo&s;t likely to take effect. After the di&s;appointment and de&s;truction of an hundred plots, he at la&s;t began to be &s;ure of this. But this &s;cheme, like all the former, was di&s;appoint|ed. The caution of lord Ru&s;&s;el, who induced the duke of Monmouth to put off the enterprize, &s;aved the kingdom from the horrors of a civil war; while Shafte&s;bury was &s;o &s;truck with a &s;en&s;e of his impend|ing danger that he left his hou&s;e, and lurking about the city attempted, but in vain, to drive the Lon|doners into open in&s;urrection. At la&s;t, enraged at the numberle&s;s cautions and delays which clogged and defeated his projects, he threatened to begin with his friends alone. However, after a long &s;trug|gle between fear and rage, he abandoned all hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, and fled out of the kingdom to Am&s;ter|dam, where he ended his turbulent life &s;oon after, without being pitied by his friends, or feared by his enemies.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of Shafte&s;bury, though it retarded the views of the con&s;pirators, did not &s;uppre&s;s them. A council of &s;ix was erected, con&s;i&s;ting of Mon|mouth, Ru&s;&s;el, E&s;&s;ex, Howard, Algernon Sidney, and John Hambden, grand&s;on to the great man of that name.</P>
<P>Such, together with the Duke of Argyle, were the leaders of this con&s;piracy. But there was al&s;o a &s;et of &s;ubordinate con&s;pirators, who frequently met together, and carried on projects quite unknown to Monmouth and his council. Among the&s;e men was colonel Rum&s;ey, an old republican officer, together with lieutenant colonel Walcot, of the &s;ame &s;tamp,
<PB N="255" REF="269">
Goodenough, under-&s;heriff of London, a zealous and noted party man, Fergu&s;on, an independent mini&s;ter, and &s;everal attornies, merchants, and trade&s;men of London. But Rum&s;ey and Fergu&s;on were the only per&s;ons that had acce&s;s to the great leaders of the con&s;piracy. The&s;e men in their meet|ings embraced the mo&s;t de&s;perate re&s;olutions. They propo&s;ed to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the king in his way to New|market; Rumbal, one of the party, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a farm upon that road called the Rye-hou&s;e, and from thence the con&s;piracy was denominated the Rye-hou&s;e Plot. They deliberated upon a &s;cheme of &s;topping the king's coach by overturning a cart on the highway at this place, and &s;hooting him through the hedges. The hou&s;e in which the king lived at Newmarket took fire accidentally, and he was obliged to leave Newmarket eight days &s;ooner than was expected, to which circum&s;tance his &s;afety was a&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Among the con&s;pirators was one Keiling, who, finding him&s;elf in danger of a pro&s;ecution for arre&s;t|ing the lord mayor of London, re&s;olved to earn his pardon by di&s;covering this plot to the mini&s;try. Co|lonel Rum&s;ey, and We&s;t, a lawyer, no &s;ooner un|der&s;tood that this man had informed again&s;t them, than they agreed to &s;ave their lives by turning king's evidence, and they &s;urrendered them&s;elves accord|ingly. Monmouth ab&s;conded; Ru&s;&s;el was &s;ent to the Tower; Grey e&s;caped; Howard was taken con|cealed in a chimney; E&s;&s;ex, Sidney, and Hambden, were &s;oon after arre&s;ted, and had the mortification to find lord Howard an evidence again&s;t them.</P>
<P>Walcot was fir&s;t brought to trial and condemned, together with Hone and Rou&s;e, two a&s;&s;ociates in the con&s;piracy, upon the evidence of Rum&s;ey, We&s;t, and Sheppard. They died penitent, acknowledging the ju&s;tice of the &s;entence by which they were exe|cuted. A much greater &s;acrifice was &s;hortly after to follow. This was the lord Ru&s;&s;el, &s;on of the earl of
<PB N="256" REF="270">
Bedford, a nobleman of numberle&s;s good qualities, and led into this con&s;piracy from a conviction of the duke of York's intentions to re&s;tore popery. He was liberal, popular, humane, and brave. All his vir|tues were &s;o many crimes in the pre&s;ent &s;u&s;picious di&s;po&s;ition of the court. The chief evidence again&s;t him was lord Howard, a man of very bad character, one of the con&s;pirators, who was now contented to take life upon &s;uch terms, and to accept of infamous &s;afety. This witne&s;s &s;wore that Ru&s;&s;el was engaged in the de&s;ign of an in&s;urrection; but he acquitted him, as did al&s;o Rum&s;ey and We&s;t, of being privy to the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. The jury, who were zealous royali&s;ts, after a &s;hort deliberation, brought the pri|&s;oner in guilty, and he was condemned to &s;uffer be|heading. The &s;caffold for his execution was erected in Lincoln's-inn-fields; he laid his head on the block without the lea&s;t change of countenance, and at two &s;trokes it was &s;evered from his body.</P>
<P>The celebrated Algernon Sidney, &s;on to the earl of Leice&s;ter, was next brought to his trial. He had been formerly engaged in the parliamentary army again&s;t the late king, and was even named on the high court of ju&s;tice that tried him, but had not taken his &s;eat among the judges. He had ever op|po&s;ed Cromwell's u&s;urpation, and went into volun|tary bani&s;hment upon the re&s;toration. His affairs, however, requiring his return, he applied to the king for a pardon, and obtained his reque&s;t. But all his hopes and all his rea&s;onings were formed upon re|publican principles. For his adored republic he had written and fought, and went into bani&s;hment, and ventured to return. It may ea&s;ily be conceived how obnoxious a man of &s;uch principles was to a court that now was not even content with limitations to its power. They went &s;o far as to take illegal me|thods to procure his condemnation. The only wit|ne&s;s that depo&s;ed again&s;t Sidney was lord Howard,
<PB N="257" REF="271">
and the law required two. In order, therefore, to make out a &s;econd witne&s;s, they had recour&s;e to a very extraordinary expedient. In ran&s;acking his clo|&s;et &s;ome di&s;cour&s;es on government were found in his own hand-writing, containing principles favourable to liberty, and in them&s;elves no way &s;ubver&s;ive of a limited government. By over&s;training &s;ome of the&s;e they were con&s;trued into trea&s;on. It was in vain he alledged that papers were no evidence; that it could not be proved they were written by him; that, if proved, the papers them&s;elves contained nothing criminal. His defence was over-ruled; the violent and inhuman Jefferies, who was now chief-ju&s;tice, ea&s;ily prevailed on a partial jury to bring him in guilty, and his execution followed &s;oon after. One can &s;carce contemplate the tran&s;actions of this reign without horror. Such a picture of factious guilt on each &s;ide, a court at once immer&s;ed in &s;en|&s;uality and blood, a people armed again&s;t each other with the mo&s;t deadly animo&s;ity, and no &s;ingle party to be found with &s;en&s;e enough to &s;tem the general torrent of rancour and factious &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>Hambden was tried &s;oon after; and as there was nothing to affect his life, he was &s;ined forty thou&s;and pounds. Holloway, a merchant of Bri&s;tol, who had fled to the We&s;t-Indies, was brought over, con|demned, and executed. Sir Thomas Arm&s;trong al&s;o, who had fled to Holland, was brought over, and &s;hared the &s;ame fate. Lord E&s;&s;ex, who had been impri&s;oned in the Power, was found in an apartment with his throat cut; but whether he was guilty of &s;uicide, or whether the bigotry of the times might not have induced &s;ome a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in to commit the crime, cannot now be known.</P>
<P>This was the la&s;t blood that was &s;hed for an impu|tation of plots or con&s;piracies, which continued dur|ing the greate&s;t part of this reign.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="272">At this period the government of Charles was as ab&s;olute as that of any monarch in Europe; but happily for mankind his tyranny was of but &s;hort duration. The king was &s;eized with a &s;udden fit, which re&s;embled an apoplexy; and though he was recovered by bleeding, yet he langui&s;hed only for a few days, and then expired, in the fifty ninth year of his age, and the twenty-fifth of his reign. Dur|ing his illne&s;s &s;ome clergymen of the church of England attended him, to whom he di&s;covered a to|tal indifference. Catholic prie&s;ts were brought to his bed-&s;ide, and from their hands he received the rites of their communion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXI. JAMES II.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1685.</NOTE>THE duke of York, who &s;ucceeded his brother by the title of king James the Second, had been bred a papi&s;t by his mother, and was &s;trongly bigotted to his principles.</P>
<P>He went openly to ma&s;s with all the en&s;igns of his dignity; and even &s;ent one Caryl as his agent to Rome to make &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to the pope, and to pave the way for the re-admi&s;&s;ion of England into the bo&s;om of the catholic church.</P>
<P>A con&s;piracy, &s;et on foot by the duke of Mon|mouth, was the fir&s;t di&s;turbance in his reign. He had, &s;ince his la&s;t con&s;piracy, been pardoned, but was ordered to depart the kingdom, and had retired to Holland. Being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from thence by the prince of Orange upon James's acce&s;&s;ion, he went to Bru&s;|&s;els, where finding him&s;elf &s;till pur&s;ued by the king's &s;everity, he re&s;olved to retaliate, and make an at|tempt
<PB N="259" REF="273">
upon the kingdom. He had ever been the darling of the people, and &s;ome averred that Charles had married his mother, and owned Monmouth's legitimacy at his death. The duke of Argyle &s;e|conded his views in Scotland, and they formed the &s;cheme of a double in&s;urrection; &s;o that while Mon|mouth &s;hould attempt to make a ri&s;ing in the We&s;t, Argyle was al&s;o to try his endeavours in the North.</P>
<P>Argyle was the fir&s;t who landed in Scot|land, where he publi&s;hed his manife&s;toes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1685.</NOTE> put him&s;elf at the head of two thou&s;and five hundred men, and &s;trove to influence the people in his cau&s;e. But a formidable body of the king's forces coming again&s;t him, his army fell away, and he him&s;elf, after being wounded in at|tempting to e&s;cape, was taken pri&s;oner by a pea&s;ant, who found him &s;tanding up to his neck in a pool of water. He was from thence carried to Edinburgh, where, after enduring many indignities with a gal|lant &s;pirit, he was publicly executed.</P>
<P>Mean while Monmouth was by this time landed in Dor&s;et&s;hire, with &s;carce an hundred followers. How|ever his name was &s;o popular, and &s;o great was the hatred of the people both for the per&s;on and reli|gion of James, that in four days he had a&s;&s;embled a body of above two thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>Being advanced to Taunton, his numbers had encrea&s;ed to &s;ix thou&s;and men; and he was obliged every day, for want of arms, to di&s;mi&s;s numbers, who crowded to his &s;tandard. He entered Bridge|water, Wells, and Frome, and was proclaimed in all tho&s;e places; but he lo&s;t the hour of action, in receiving and claiming the&s;e empty honours.</P>
<P>The king was not a little alarmed at his inva&s;ion; but &s;till more at the &s;ucce&s;s of an undertaking that at fir&s;t appeared de&s;perate. Six regiments of Briti&s;h troops were called over from Holland, and a body of regulars, to the number of three thou&s;and men,
<PB N="260" REF="274">
were &s;ent, under the command of the earl of Fever|&s;ham and Churchill, to check the progre&s;s of the rebels. They took po&s;t at Sedgemore, a village in the neighbourhood of Bridgewater, and were joined by the militia of the country in con&s;iderable num|bers. It was there that Monmouth re&s;olved, by a de&s;perate effort, to lo&s;e his life or gain the kingdom. The negligent di&s;po&s;ition made by Fever&s;ham invited him to the attack; and his faithful followers &s;hewed what courage and principle could do again&s;t di&s;ci|pline and &s;uperior numbers. They drove the royal infantry from their ground, and were upon the point of gaining the victory, when the mi&s;conduct of Monmouth, and the cowardice of lord Gray, who commanded the hor&s;e, brought all to ruin. This nobleman fled at the fir&s;t on&s;et; and the rebels being charged in flank by the victorious army, gave way, after a three hours conte&s;t. About three hundred were killed in the engagement, and a thou&s;and in the pur&s;uit; and thus ended an enterprize, ra&s;hly begun, and more feebly conducted.</P>
<P>Monmouth fled from the field of battle above twenty miles, till his hor&s;e &s;unk under him. He then alighted, and, exchanging cloaths with a &s;hep|herd, fled on foot, attended by a German count, who had accompanied him from Holland. Being quite exhau&s;ted with hunger and fatigue, they both lay down in a field, and covered them&s;elves with fern. The &s;hepherd being found in Monmouth's cloaths by the pur&s;uers encrea&s;ed the diligence of the &s;earch; and, by the means of blood hounds, he was detected in his mi&s;erable &s;ituation, with raw pea&s;e in pocket, which he had gathered in the fields to &s;u&s;tain life. He bur&s;t into tears when &s;eized by his ene|mies; and petitioned, with the mo&s;t abject &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, for life. He wrote the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive letters to the king; and that monarch, willing to fea&s;t his eyes with the mi&s;eries of a fallen enemy,
<PB N="261" REF="275">
gave him an audience. At this interview the duke fell upon his knees, and begged his life in the mo&s;t abject terms. He even &s;igned a paper, offered him by the king, declaring his own illegitimacy; and then the &s;tern tyrant a&s;&s;ured him, that his crime was of &s;uch a nature as could not be pardoned. The duke perceiving that he had nothing to hope from the clemency of his uncle, recollected his &s;pirits, ro&s;e up, and retired with an air of di&s;dain. He was followed to the &s;caffold with great compa&s;&s;ion from the populace. He warned the executioner not to fall into the &s;ame error which he had committed in be|heading Ru&s;&s;el, where it had been nece&s;&s;ary to re|double the blow. But this only encrea&s;ed the &s;eve|rity of his puni&s;hment, the man was &s;eized with an univer&s;al trepidation; and he &s;truck a feeble blow, upon which the duke rai&s;ed his head from the block, as if to reproach him; he gently laid down his head a &s;econd time, and the executioner &s;truck him again and again to no purpo&s;e. He at la&s;t threw the ax down; but the &s;heriff compelled him to re&s;ume the attempt, and at two blows more the head was &s;evered from the body. Such was the end of James, duke of Monmouth, the darling of the Engli&s;h people. He was brave, &s;incere, and good natured, open to flattery, and by that &s;educed into an enterprize which exceeded his capacity.</P>
<P>But it were well for the in&s;urgents, and fortunate for the king, if the blood that was now &s;hed had been thought a &s;ufficient expiation for the late offence. The victorious army behaved with the mo&s;t &s;avage cruelty to the pri&s;oners taken after the battle. Fe|ver&s;ham immediately after the victory hanged up above twenty pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>The military &s;everities of the commanders were &s;till inferior to the legal &s;laughters committed by judge Jefferies, who was &s;ent down to try the delin|quents. The natural brutality of this man's tem|per
<PB N="262" REF="276">
was enflamed by continual intoxication. He told the pri&s;oners, that if they would &s;ave him the trou|ble of trying them, they might expect &s;ome favour, otherwi&s;e he would execute the law upon them with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he utmo&s;t &s;everity. Many poor wretches were thus allured into a confe&s;&s;ion, and found that it only ha&s;tened their de&s;truction. No le&s;s than eighty were executed at Dorche&s;ter; and, on the whole, at Exe|ter, Taunton, and Wells, two hundred and fifty-one are computed to have fallen by the hand of ju&s;|tice.</P>
<P>In eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters, James proceeded with &s;till greater inju&s;tice. Among tho&s;e who di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves again&s;t popery, was one doctor Sharpe, a clergyman of London, who declaimed with ju&s;t &s;e|verity again&s;t tho&s;e who had changed their religion, by &s;uch arguments as the popi&s;h mi&s;&s;ionaries were able to produce. This being &s;uppo&s;ed to reflect up|on the king, gave great offence at court; and po&s;itive orders were given to the bi&s;hop of London to &s;u&s;|pend Sharpe till his maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure &s;hould be far|ther known. The bi&s;hop refu&s;ed to comply; and the king re&s;olved to puni&s;h the bi&s;hop him&s;elf for di&s;obedience.</P>
<P>To effect his de&s;igns, an eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ion was i&s;&s;ued out, by which &s;even commi&s;&s;ioners were inve&s;ted with a full and unlimited authority over the whole church of England. Before this tribunal the bi&s;hop was &s;ummoned, and not only he, but Sharpe, the preacher, were &s;u&s;pended.</P>
<P>The next &s;tep was to allow a liberty of con|&s;cience to all &s;ectaries; and he was taught to believe that the truth of the catholic religion would then, upon a fair trial, gain the victory. He therefore i&s;|&s;ued a declaration of general indulgence, and a&s;&s;erted that non-conformity to the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion was no longer penal.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="277">To complete his work he publicly &s;ent the earl of Ca&s;tlemaine amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary to Rome, in order to expre&s;s his obedience to the pope, and to reconcile his kingdoms to the catholic communion. Never was there &s;o much contempt thrown upon an emba&s;&s;y that was &s;o boldly undertaken. The court of Rome expected but little &s;ucce&s;s from mea&s;ures &s;o blindly conducted. They were &s;en&s;ible that the king was openly &s;triking at tho&s;e laws and opinions which it was his bu&s;ine&s;s to undermine in &s;ilence and &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>The Je&s;uits &s;oon after were permitted to erect colleges in different parts of the kingdom; they ex|erci&s;ed the catholic wor&s;hip in the mo&s;t public man|ner; and four catholic bi&s;hops, con&s;ecrated in the king's chapel, were &s;ent through the kingdom to exerci&s;e their epi&s;copal functions, under the title of apo&s;tolic vicars.</P>
<P>Father Francis, a Benedictine monk, was recom|mended by the king to the univer&s;ity of Cambridge, for the degree of ma&s;ter of arts. But his religion was a &s;tumbling-block which the univer&s;ity could not get over; and they pre&s;ented a petition, be&s;eeching the king to recal his mandate. Their petition was di&s;regarded, their deputies denied an hearing: the vice-chancellor him&s;elf was &s;ummoned to appear be|fore the high commi&s;&s;ion court, and deprived of his office; yet the univer&s;ity per&s;i&s;ted, and father Fran|cis was refu&s;ed.</P>

The fellows of the college made very &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive applications to the king for re|calling his mandate; they refu&s;ed admitting the can|didate, and James finding them re&s;olute in the de|fence of their privileges, ejected them all except two.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="278"><NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

The clergy were known univer&s;ally to di&s;approve of the&s;e mea&s;ures, and they were now re&s;olved to di&s;obey an order dictated by the mo&s;t bigotted motives. They were determined to tru&s;t their cau&s;e to the favour of the people, and that univer&s;al jealou&s;y which pre|vailed again&s;t the encroachments of the crown. The fir&s;t champions on this &s;ervice of danger were Loyde, bi&s;hop of St. A&s;aph, Ken, of Bath and Wells, Tur|ner, of Ely, Lake, of Chiche&s;ter, White, of Peter|borough, and Trelawney, of Bri&s;tol; the&s;e, together with Sancroft, the primate, concerted an addre&s;s, in the form of a petition, to the king, which, with the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of zeal and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, remon|&s;trated that they could not read his declaration con|&s;i&s;tent with their con&s;ciences, or the re&s;pect they owed the prote&s;tant religion.</P>
<P>The king in a fury &s;ummoned the bi&s;hops before the council, and there que&s;tioned them whether they would acknowledge their petition. They for &s;ome time declined giving an an&s;wer; but being urged by the chancellor, they at la&s;t owned it. On their re|fu&s;al to give bail, an order was immediately drawn for their commitment to the Tower, and the crown-lawyers received directions to pro&s;ecute them for a &s;editious libel.</P>
<P>The twenty-ninth day of June was fixed for their trial; and their return was more &s;plendidly at|tended than their impri&s;onment. The cau&s;e was looked upon as involving the fate of the nation, and future freedom, or future &s;lavery awaited the deci|&s;ion. The di&s;pute was learnedly managed by the lawyers on both &s;ides. Holloway and Powel, two of the judges, declared them&s;elves in favour of the bi|&s;hops.
<PB N="265" REF="279">
The jury withdrew into a chamber, where they pa&s;&s;ed the whole night; but next morning they returned into court, and pronounced the bi&s;hops&punc; Not guilty. We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall in&s;tantly rang with loud acclamations, which were communicated to the whole extent of the city. They even reached the camp at Houn&s;low, where the king was at dinner, in lord Fever&s;ham's tent. His maje&s;ty demanding the cau&s;e of tho&s;e rejoicings, and being informed that it was nothing but the &s;oldiers &s;houting at the delivery of the bi&s;hops,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Call you that nothing, cried he; but &s;o much the wor&s;e for them!"</Q></P>
<P>It was in this po&s;ture of affairs that all people turned their eyes upon William prince of Orange, who had married Mary, the elde&s;t daughter of king James.</P>
<P>William was a prince who had, from his earlie&s;t entrance into bu&s;ine&s;s, been immer&s;ed in dangers, calamities, and politics. The ambition of France, and the jealou&s;ies of Holland, had &s;erved to &s;harpen his talents, and to give him a propen&s;ity to intrigue.</P>
<P>This politic prince now plainly &s;aw that James had incurred the mo&s;t violent hatred of his &s;ubjects.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1688.</NOTE> He was minutely inform|ed of their di&s;contents; and, by &s;eeming to di&s;courage, &s;till farther encrea&s;ed them, hoping to gain the kingdom for him&s;elf in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>The time when the prince entered upon his enterprize was ju&s;t when the people were in a flame from this recent in&s;ult offered to their bi&s;hops. He had before this made con&s;iderable augmentations to the Dutch fleet, and the &s;hips were then lying ready in the harbour. Some additional troops were al&s;o levied, and &s;ums of money rai&s;ed for other purpo&s;es were converted to the advancement of this expedition.</P>
<P>So well concerted were his mea&s;ures, that in three days above four hundred tran&s;ports were hired, the army fell down the rivers and canals from Nimeguen,
<PB N="266" REF="280">
with all nece&s;&s;ary &s;tores; and the prince &s;et &s;ail from Helvoet&s;luys with a fleet of near five hundred ve&s;&s;els, and an army of above fourteen thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>It was given out that this inva&s;ion was intended for the coa&s;ts of France, and many of the Engli&s;h, who &s;aw the fleet pa&s;s along their coa&s;ts, little expected to &s;ee it land on their own &s;hores. Thus after a voyage of two days, the prince landed his army at the village of Broxholme in Torbay, on the fifth of November, which was the anniver&s;ary of the gun-powder trea|&s;on.</P>
<P>But though the invitation from the Engli&s;h was very general, the prince for &s;ome time had the mor|tification to find him&s;elf joined by very few. He marched fir&s;t to Exeter, where the country people had been &s;o lately terrified with the executions which had en&s;ued on Monmouth's rebellion, that they con|tinued to ob&s;erve a &s;trict neutrality. He remained for ten days in expectation of being joined by the malcontents, and at la&s;t began to de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s. But ju&s;t when he began to deliberate about reimbark|ing his forces, he was joined by &s;everal per&s;ons of con&s;equence, and the whole country &s;oon after came flocking to his &s;tandard. The nobility, clergy, officers, and even the king's own &s;ervants and creatures, were unanimous in de&s;erting James. Lord Churchill had been rai&s;ed from the rank of a page, and had been inve&s;ted with an high command in the army; had been created a peer, and owed his whole fortune to the king's bounty: even he de&s;erted among the re&s;t, and carried with him the duke of Grafton, natural &s;on to the late king, colonel Berkely, and &s;ome others.</P>
<P>The prince of Denmark, and Anne, his favourite daughter, perceiving the de&s;peration of his circum|&s;tances, re&s;olved to leave him, and take part with the prevailing &s;ide. When he was told that the prince and prince&s;s had followed the re&s;t of his favourites,

<P>The king, alarmed every day more and more with the pro&s;pect of a general di&s;affection, was re&s;olved to hearken to tho&s;e who advi&s;ed his quitting the king|dom. To prepare for this he fir&s;t &s;ent away the queen, who arrived &s;afely at Calais, under the con|duct of count Lauzun, an old favourite of the French king. He him&s;elf &s;oon after di&s;appeared in the night time, attended only by Sir Edward Hales, a new convert; but was di&s;covered and brought back by the mob.</P>
<P>But &s;hortly after being confined at Roche&s;ter, and ob&s;erving that he was entirely neglected by his own &s;ubjects, he re&s;olved to &s;eek &s;afety from the king of France, the only friend he had &s;till remaining. He accordingly fled to the &s;ea-&s;ide, attended by his na|tural &s;on the duke of Berwick, where he embarked for the continent, and arrived in &s;afety at Ambleteu&s;e in Picardy, from whence he ha&s;tened to the court of France, where he &s;till enjoyed the empty title of a king, and the appellation of a &s;aint, which flattered him more.</P>
<P>The king having thus abdicated the throne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1689.</NOTE> the next con&s;ideration was the appointing a &s;ucce&s;&s;or. Some declared for a regent; others, that the prince&s;s of Orange &s;hould be inve&s;ted with re|gal power, and the young prince con&s;idered as &s;uppo|&s;ititious. After a long debate in both hou&s;es, a new &s;o|vereign was preferred to a regent, by a majority of two voices. It was agreed that the prince and prince&s;s of Orange &s;hould reign jointly as king and queen of England, while the admini&s;tration of government &s;hould be placed in the hands of the prince only.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXII. WILLIAM III.</HEAD>
<P>WILLIAM was no &s;ooner elected to the throne, than he began to experience the difficulty of governing a people, who were more ready to examine the commands of their &s;uperiors, than to obey them.</P>
<P>His reign commenced with an attempt, &s;imilar to that which had been the principal cau&s;e of all the di&s;|turbances in the preceding reign, and which had excluded the monarch from the throne. William was a Calvini&s;t, and con&s;equently aver&s;e to per&s;ecu|tion; he therefore began by attempting to repeal tho&s;e laws that enjoined uniformity of wor&s;hip; and though he could not entirely &s;ucceed in his de&s;ign, a tolera|tion was granted to &s;uch di&s;&s;enters as &s;hould take the oaths of allegiance, and hold no private conventicles.</P>
<P>In the mean time James, who&s;e authority was &s;till acknowledged in Ireland, embarked at Bre&s;t for that kingdom, and on May 22 arrived at Kin|&s;ale. He &s;oon after made his public entry into Dublin, amid&s;t the acclamations of the inhabitants. He found the appearances of things in that country equal to his mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations. Tyrcon|nel, the lord lieutenant, was devoted to his intere&s;ts; his old army was &s;teady, and a new one rai&s;ed, amounting together to near forty-thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the &s;ea&s;on would permit, he went to lay &s;iege to Londonderry, a town of &s;mall impor|tance in it&s;elf, but rendered famous by the &s;tand which it made on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The be&s;ieged endured the mo&s;t poignant &s;ufferings from fatigue and famine, until at la&s;t relieved by a &s;tore &s;hip, that happily broke the boom laid acro&s;s the
<PB N="269" REF="286">
river to prevent a &s;upply. The joy of the inhabi|tants at this unexpected relief, was only equalled by the rage and di&s;appointment of the be&s;iegers. The army of James was &s;o di&s;pirited by the &s;ucce&s;s of this enterprize, that they abandoned the &s;iege in the night; and retired with precipitation, after having lo&s;t above nine thou&s;and men before the place.</P>
<P>It was upon the oppo&s;ite banks of the river Boyne that both armies came in &s;ight of each other,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1690.</NOTE> inflamed with all the animo&s;ities ari&s;ing from religion, hatred, and revenge. The river Boyne at this place was not &s;o deep, but that men might wade over on foot; however, the banks were rugged, and rendered dan|gerous by old hou&s;es and ditches, which &s;erved to defend the latent enemy. William, who now headed the prote&s;tant army, had no &s;ooner arrived, but he rode along the &s;ide of the river, in &s;ight of both armies, to make proper ob&s;ervations upon the plan of battle; but in the mean time being perceived by the enemy, a cannon was privately brought out, and planted again&s;t him, where he was &s;itting. The &s;hot killed &s;everal of his followers; and he him&s;elf was wounded in the &s;houlder.</P>
<P>Early the next morning at &s;ix o'clock, king Wil|liam gave orders to force a pa&s;s over the river. This the army undertook in three different places; and after a furious cannonading, the battle began with unu&s;ual vigour. The Iri&s;h troops, though reckoned the be&s;t in Europe abroad, have always &s;ought indif|ferently at home. After an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, they fled with precipitation; leaving the French and Swi&s;s regiments, who came to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to make the be&s;t retreat they could. William led on his hor&s;e in per&s;on; and contributed, by his activity and vigilance, to &s;ecure the victory. James was not in the battle, but &s;tood aloof, during the action, on the hill of Dunmore,
<PB N="270" REF="287">
&s;urrounded with &s;ome &s;quadrons of hor&s;e; and at intervals was heard to exclaim, when he &s;aw his own troops repul&s;ing tho&s;e of the enemy,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O &s;pare my Engli&s;h &s;ubjects."</Q></P>
<P>The Iri&s;h lo&s;t about fifteen hundred men, and the prote&s;tants about one third of that number. The victory was &s;plendid and almo&s;t deci&s;ive; but the death of the duke of Schomberg, who was &s;hot as he was cro&s;&s;ing the water, &s;eemed to outweigh the whole lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by the enemy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1691.</NOTE>The la&s;t battle fought in favour of James was at Aughrim. The enemy fought with &s;urpri&s;ing fury, and the hor&s;e were &s;everal times repul&s;ed; but the Engli&s;h wading through the middle of a bog up to the wa&s;te in mud, and rallying with &s;ome difficulty on the firm ground on the other &s;ide, renewed the combat with great fury. St. Ruth, the Iri&s;h general, being killed by a cannon-ball, his fate &s;o di&s;pirited his troops, that they gave way on all &s;ides, and retreated to Limerick, where they re&s;olved to make a final &s;tand, after having lo&s;t above five thou&s;and of the flower of their army. Limerick, the la&s;t retrea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the Iri&s;h forces, made a brave de|fence; but &s;oon &s;eeing the enemy advanced within ten paces of the bridge foot, and perceiving them|&s;elves &s;urrounded on all &s;ides, they determined to capitulate; a negociation was immediately begun, and ho&s;tilities cea&s;ed on both &s;ides. The Roman catholics by this capitulation were re&s;tored to the en|joyment of tho&s;e liberties in the exerci&s;e of their religion, which they had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the reign of king Charles the Second. All per&s;ons were indulged with free leave to remove with their families and effects to any other country, except England and Scotland. In con&s;equence of this, about fourteen thou&s;and of tho&s;e who had fought for king James went over into France, having tran&s;ports provided by government for conveying them thither.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="288">James was now reduced to the lowe&s;t ebb of de&s;pondence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1692.</NOTE> his de&s;igns upon England were quite fru&s;trated, &s;o that nothing was left his friends, but the hopes of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating the monarch on the throne. The&s;e ba&s;e attempts, as barbarous as they were u&s;ele&s;s, were not entirely di&s;a|greeable to the temper of James. It is &s;aid he encourag|ed and propo&s;ed them; but they all proved un&s;ervice|able to his cau&s;e, and only ended in the de&s;truction of the undertakers. From that time till he died, which was about &s;even years, he continued to re&s;ide at St. Ger|main's a pen&s;ioner on the bounties of Lewis, and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed by occa&s;ional liberalities from his daughter and friends in England. He died on the &s;ixteenth day of September, in the year 1700, after having laboured un|der a tedious &s;ickne&s;s; and many miracles, as the peo|ple thought, were wrought at his tomb. Indeed the latter part of his life was calculated to in&s;pire the &s;uper|&s;titious with reverence for his piety. He &s;ubjected him|&s;elf to acts of uncommon penance and mortification. He frequently vi&s;ited the poor monks of La Trappe, who were edified by his humble and pious deportment. His pride and arbitrary temper &s;eemed to have vani&s;h|ed with his greatne&s;s; he became affable, kind, and ea&s;y, to all his dependents; and in his la&s;t illne&s;s con|jured his &s;on to prefer religion to every worldly ad|vantage, a coun&s;el which that prince &s;trictly obeyed. He died with great marks of devotion, and was in|terred, at his own reque&s;t, in the church of the En|gli&s;h Benedictines at Paris, without any funeral &s;o|lemnity.</P>
<P>William, upon accepting of the crown, was re&s;olv|ed to pre&s;erve, as much as he was able, that &s;hare of prerogative which &s;till was left him.</P>
<P>But at length he became fatigued with oppo&s;ing the laws which parliament every day were laying round his authority, and gave up the conte&s;t. He admit|ted every re&s;traint upon the prerogative in England,
<PB N="272" REF="289">
upon condition of being properly &s;upplied with the means of humbling the power of France. War and the balance of power in Europe, were all he knew, or indeed de&s;ired to under&s;tand. Provided the par|liament furni&s;hed him with &s;upplies for the&s;e pur|po&s;es, he permitted them to rule the internal polity at their plea&s;ure. For the pro&s;ecution of the war with France, the &s;ums of money granted him were incre|dible. The nation, not contented with furni&s;hing him &s;uch &s;ums of money as they were capable of rai&s;|ing by the taxes of the year, mortgaged tho&s;e taxes, and involved them&s;elves in debts, which they have never &s;ince been able to di&s;charge. For all that pro|fu&s;ion of wealth granted to maintain the imaginary balance of Europe, England received in return the empty reward of military glory in Flanders, and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having given their allies, particularly the Dutch, frequent opportunities of being ungrate|ful.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1697.</NOTE>The war with France continued during the greate&s;t part of this king's reign; but at length the treaty of Ry&s;wic put an end to tho&s;e contentions, in which England had engaged without policy, and came off without advantage. In the general pacification, her intere&s;ts &s;eemed en|tirely de&s;erted; and for all the trea&s;ures &s;he had &s;ent to the continent, and all the blood which &s;he had &s;hed there, the only equivalent &s;he received was an acknowledgement of king William's title from the king of France.</P>
<P>William was naturally of a very feeble con&s;titu|tion; and it was by this time almo&s;t exhau&s;ted, by a &s;eries of continual di&s;quietude and action. He had endeavoured to repair his con&s;titution, or at lea&s;t to conceal its decays, by exerci&s;e and riding. On the twenty-fir&s;t day of February, in riding to Hampton-Court from Ken&s;ington, his hor&s;e fell under him, and he was thrown with &s;uch violence, that his col|lar
<PB N="273" REF="290">
bone was fractured. His attendants conveyed him to the palace of Hampton court, where the frac|ture was reduced, and in the evening he returned to Ken&s;ington in his coach. The jolting of the carri|age di&s;united the fracture once more; and the bones were again replaced, under Bidloo his phy&s;ician. This in a robu&s;t con&s;titution would have been a trifling misfortune; but in him it was fatal. For &s;ome time he appeared in a fair way of recovery; but falling a&s;leep on his couch, he was &s;eized with a &s;hiver|ing, which terminated in a fever asid diarrhoea, which &s;oon became dangerous and de&s;perate. Perceiving his end approaching, the objects of his former care lay &s;till next his heart; and the fate of Europe &s;eemed to remove the &s;en&s;ations he might be &s;uppo&s;ed to feel for his own.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIX. ANNE.</HEAD>
<P>ANNE, married to prince George of Denmark, a&s;cended the throne in the thirty-eighth year of her age, to the general &s;atisfaction of all parties. She was the &s;econd daughter of king James, by his fir&s;t wife, the daughter of chancellor Hyde, after|wards earl of Clarendon. Upon coming to the crown, &s;he re&s;olved to declare war again&s;t France, and communicated her intentions to the hou&s;e of commons, by whom it was approved, and war was proclaimed accordingly.</P>
<P>This declaration of war on the part of the Engli&s;h, was &s;econded by &s;imilar declarations by the Dutch
<PB N="274" REF="291">
and Germans, all on the &s;ame day. The French monarch could not &s;uppre&s;s his anger at &s;uch a com|bination, but his chief re&s;entment fell upon the Dutch. He declared, with great emotion, that as for tho&s;e gentlemen pedlars, the Dutch, they &s;hould one day repent their in&s;olence and pre&s;umption, in declaring war again&s;t one who&s;e power they had formerly felt and dreaded. However, the affairs of the allies were no way influenced by his threats. The duke of Marl|borough had his views gratified, in being appointed general of the Engli&s;h forces; and he was &s;till farther flattered by the Dutch, who, though the earl of Athlone had a right to &s;hare the command, ap|pointed Marlborough generali&s;&s;imo of the allied ar|my. And it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that few men &s;hone more, either in debate or action, than he; &s;erene in the mid&s;t of danger, and indefatigable in the cabinet; &s;o that he became the mo&s;t formidable enemy to France that England had produced, &s;ince the con|quering times of Cre&s;&s;y and Agincourt.</P>
<P>A great part of the hi&s;tory of this reign, con&s;i&s;ts in battles fought upon the continent, which, though of very little advantage to the intere&s;ts of the nation, were very great additions to its honour. The&s;e tri|umphs, it is true, are pa&s;&s;ed away, and nothing re|mains of them but the names of Blenheim, Ramil|lies, Oudenarde and Malplaquet, where the allied army gained great, but (with re&s;pect to England) u&s;ele&s;s victories.</P>
<P>A conque&s;t of much greater national importance was gained with le&s;s expence of blood and trea&s;ure in Spain. The mini&s;try of England under&s;tanding that the French were employed in equipping a &s;trong &s;quadron in Bre&s;t, &s;ent out Sir Cloude&s;ly Shovel, and Sir George Rooke to watch their motions. Sir George, however, had farther orders to convoy a body of forces in tran&s;port-&s;hips to Barcelona, upon which a fruitle&s;s attack was made by the prince of
<PB N="275" REF="292">
He&s;&s;e. Finding no hopes, therefore, from this expe|dition, in two days after the troops were reimbark|ed, Sir George Rooke, joined by Sir Cloude&s;ly, cal|led a council of war on board the fleet, as they lay off the coa&s;t of Africa. In this they re&s;olved to make an attempt upon Gibraltar, a city then belonging to the Spaniards, at that time ill provided with a garri|&s;on, as neither expecting, nor fearing &s;uch an at|tempt.</P>
<P>The town of Gibraltar &s;tands upon a tongue of land, as the mariners call it, and defended by a rock inacce&s;&s;ible on every &s;ide but one. The prince of He&s;&s;e landed his troops, to the number of eighteen hundred, on the continent adjoining, and &s;ummon|ed the town to &s;urrender, but without effect. Next day the admiral gave orders for cannonading the town; and perceiving that the enemy were driven from their fortifications at a place called the South Mole-head, ordered captain Whitaker to arm all the boats, and a&s;|&s;ault that quarter. Tho&s;e officers who happened to be neare&s;t the Mole, immediately manned their boats without orders, and entered the fortification &s;word in hand. But they were premature; for the Spa|niards &s;prung a mine, by which two lieutenants, and about one hundred men were killed and wounded. Neverthele&s;s, the two captains, Hicks and Jumper, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a platform, and kept their ground, until they were &s;u&s;tained by captain Whitaker, and the re&s;t of the &s;eamen, who took a redoubt between the Mole and the town by &s;torm. Then the gover|nor capitulated, and the prince of He&s;&s;e entered the place, amazed at the &s;ucce&s;s of the attempt, con&s;i|dering the &s;trength of the fortifications. When the news of this conque&s;t was brought to England, it was for &s;ome time in debate whether it was a capture worth thanking the admiral for. It was at la&s;t con&s;idered as unworthy public gratitude; and while the duke of Marlborough was extolled for u&s;ele&s;s &s;ervices, Sir
<PB N="276" REF="293">
George Rooke was left to neglect, and &s;oon di&s;placed from his command, for having &s;o e&s;&s;entially &s;erved his country. A &s;triking in&s;tance that even in the mo&s;t enlightened age, popular applau&s;e is mo&s;t u&s;ually mi&s;|placed. Gibraltar has ever &s;ince remained in the poffe&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h, and continues of the ut|mo&s;t u&s;e in refitting that part of the navy de&s;tined to annoy an enemy, or protect our trade in the Medi|terranean.

<P>While the Engli&s;h were thus victorious by land and &s;ea, a new &s;cene of contention was opened on the &s;ide of Spain, where the ambition of the Euro|pean princes exerted it&s;elf with the &s;ame fury that had filled the re&s;t of the continent. Philip the Fourth, grand&s;on of Lewis the Fourteenth, had been placed upon the throne of that kingdom, and had been received with the joyful concurrence of the greate&s;t part of his &s;ubjects. He had al&s;o been no|minated &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the crown by the late king of Spain's will. But in a former treaty among the powers of Europe, Charles, &s;on of the emperor of Germany, was appointed heir to that crown; and this treaty had been guarantied by France her&s;elf, though &s;he now re&s;olved to rever&s;e that con&s;ent in favour of a de&s;cendant of the hou&s;e of Bourbon. Charles was &s;till farther led on to put in for the crown of Spain by the invitation of the Catalonians, who declared in his favour, and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Engli&s;h and Portugue&s;e, who promi&s;ed to arm in his cau&s;e. He was furni&s;hed with two hundred tran&s;ports, thirty &s;hips of war, and nine thou&s;and men, for the conque&s;t of that ex|ten&s;ive empire. But the earl of Peterborough, a man of romantic bravery, offered to conduct them; and his &s;ingle &s;ervice was thought equivalent to armies.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="294">The earl of Peterborough was one of the mo&s;t &s;ingular and extraordinary men of the age in which he lived. When yet but fifteen he fought again&s;t the Moors in Africa; at twenty he a&s;&s;i&s;ted in com|pa&s;&s;ing the revolution, and he now carried on the war in Spain almo&s;t at his own expence; his friend|&s;hip for the duke Charles being one of his chief mo|tives to this great undertaking. He was deformed in his per&s;on; but of a mind the mo&s;t generous, honourable, and active. His fir&s;t attempt upon landing in Spain was the taking Barcelona, a &s;trong city, with a garri&s;on of five thou&s;and men, while his own army amounted to little more than nine thou|&s;and.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es, however, were but of &s;hort continu|ance; Peterborough being recalled, and the army under Charles being commanded by the lord Gal|way. This nobleman having received intelligence that the enemy, under the command of the duke of Berwick, was po&s;ted near the town of Almanza, he advanced thither to give him battle. The conflict began about two in the afternoon, and the whole front of each army was fully engaged.The center, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of battalions from Great Britain and Holland, &s;eemed at fir&s;t victorious; but the Portugue&s;e hor&s;e, by whom they were &s;upported, betaking them&s;elves to flight on the fir&s;t charge, the Engli&s;h troops were flanked and &s;urrounded on every &s;ide. In this dreadful emer|gency, they formed them&s;elves into a &s;quare, and re|tired to an eminence, where, being ignorant of the country, and de&s;titute of all &s;upplies, they were obliged to &s;urrender pri&s;oners of war, to the number of ten thou&s;and men. This victory was complete and deci&s;ive; and all Spain, except the province of Catalonia, returned to their duty to Philip their &s;overeign.</P>
<P>The councils of the queen had hitherto been go|verned by a Whig mini&s;try; for though the duke of
<PB N="278" REF="295">
Marlborough had fir&s;t &s;tarted in the Tory intere&s;t, he &s;oon joined the oppo&s;ite faction, as he found them mo&s;t &s;incere in their de&s;ires to humble the power of France. The Whigs therefore &s;till pur&s;ued the &s;chemes of the late king; and impre&s;&s;ed with a re|publican &s;pirit of liberty, &s;trove to humble de&s;poti&s;m in every part of Europe. In a government where the rea&s;oning of individuals, retired from power, generally leads tho&s;e who command, the de&s;igns of the mini&s;try mu&s;t alter as the people happen to change. The people, in fact, were beginning to change. But previous to the di&s;grace of the Whig mini&s;try, who&s;e fall was now ha&s;tening, a mea&s;ure of the greate&s;t importance took place in parliament; a mea&s;ure that had been wi&s;hed by many, but thought too difficult for execution. What I mean, is the union between the two kingdoms of England and Scotland; which, though they were governed by one &s;overeign &s;ince the acce&s;&s;ion of James the Fir&s;t, yet were &s;till ruled by their re&s;pective parliaments, and often profe&s;&s;ed to pur&s;ue oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts and different de&s;igns.</P>
<P>The attempt for an union was begun at the com|mencement of this reign; but &s;ome di&s;putes ari&s;ing relative to the trade to the Ea&s;t, the conference was broke up, and it was thought that an adju&s;tment would be impo&s;&s;ible. It was revived by an act in either parlia|ment, granting power to commi&s;&s;ioners named on the part of both nations, to treat on the preliminary arti|cles of an union, which &s;hould afterwards undergo a more thorough di&s;cu&s;&s;ion by the legi&s;lative body of both kingdoms. The choice of the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners was left to the queen; and &s;he took care that none &s;hould be employed, but &s;uch as heartily wi&s;hed to promote &s;o de&s;irable a mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Accordingly the queen having appointed commi&s;|&s;ioners on both &s;ides, they met in the council-cham|ber of the Cock-pit, near Whitehall, which was the place appointed for their conferences. As the queen
<PB N="279" REF="296">
frequently exhorted the commi&s;&s;ioners di&s;patch, the articles of this famous union were &s;oon agreed to, and &s;igned by the commi&s;&s;ioners; and it only remained to lay them before the parliaments of both nations.</P>
<P>In this famous treaty it was &s;tipulated, that the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion to the united kingdoms &s;hould be ve&s;ted in the hou&s;e of Hanover; that the united kingdoms &s;hould be repre&s;ented by one and the &s;ame parliament; that all the &s;ubjects of Great Britain &s;hould enjoy a com|munication of privileges and advantages; that they &s;hould have the &s;ame allowances and privileges with re&s;pect to commerce and cu&s;toms; that the laws con|cerning public right, civil government and policy, &s;hould be the &s;ame throughout the two united king|doms; but that no alteration &s;hould be made in laws which concerned private right, except for the evi|dent benefit of the &s;ubjects of Scotland; that the courts of &s;e&s;&s;ion, and all other courts of judicature in Scotland, &s;hould remain, as then con&s;tituted by the laws of that kingdom, with the &s;ame authority and pri|vileges as before the union; that Scotland &s;hould be repre&s;ented in the parliament of Great Britain, by &s;ixteen peers, and forty-five commoners, to be elected in &s;uch a manner, as &s;hould be &s;ettled by the pre&s;ent parliament of Scotland; that all peers of Scotland &s;hould be con&s;idered as peers of Great Bri|tain, and rank immediately after the Engli&s;h peers of the like degrees, at the time of the union, and be|fore &s;uch as &s;hould be created after it; that they &s;hould enjoy all the privileges of Engli&s;h peers, ex|cept that of &s;itting and voting in parliament, or &s;it|ting upon the trial of peers; that all the in&s;ignia of royalty and government &s;hould remain as they were; that all laws and &s;tatutes in either kingdom, &s;o far as they might be incon&s;i&s;tent with the terms of the&s;e ar|ticles, &s;hould cea&s;e, and be declared void by the re|&s;pective parliaments of the two kingdoms. The&s;e were the principal articles of the union; and it only
<PB N="280" REF="297">
remained to obtain the &s;anction of the legi&s;lature of both kingdoms to give them authority.</P>
<P>The arguments in the&s;e different a&s;&s;emblies were &s;uited to the audience. To induce the Scotch par|liament to come into the mea&s;ure, it was alledged by the mini&s;try, and their &s;upporters, that an entire and perfect union would be the &s;olid foundation of a la&s;ting peace. It would &s;ecure their religion, liberty, and property, remove the animo&s;ities that prevailed among them&s;elves, and the jealou&s;ies that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted be|tween the two nations. It would increa&s;e their &s;trength, riches and commerce, the whole i&s;land would be joined in affection, and freed from all apprehen&s;ions of different intere&s;ts. It would be enabled to re&s;i&s;t all its enemies, &s;upport the Prote&s;tant intere&s;ts, and maintain the liberties of Europe. It was ob&s;erved, that the le&s;s the wheels of government were clogged by a multiplicity of councils, the more vigorous would be their exertions. They were &s;hewn that the taxes which, in con&s;equence of this union, they were to pay, were by no means &s;o great proportionably as their &s;hare in the legi&s;lature. That their taxes did not amount to a &s;eventieth part of tho&s;e &s;upplied by the Engli&s;h; and yet their &s;hare in the legi&s;lature was not a tenth part le&s;s. Such were the arguments in favour of the union, addre&s;&s;ed to the Scotch parlia|ment. In the Engli&s;h hou&s;es it was ob&s;erved, that a powerful and dangerous nation would thus for ever be prevented from giving them any di&s;turbance. That in ca&s;e of any future rupture, England had every thing to lo&s;e, and nothing to gain again&s;t a nation that was courageous and poor.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the Scotch were fired with in|dignation at the thoughts of lo&s;ing their ancient and independent government. The nobility found them&s;elves degraded in point of dignity and influence, by being excluded from their &s;eats in parliament. The trading part of the nation be|held
<PB N="281" REF="298">
held their commerce loaded with heavy duties, and con|&s;idered their new privilege of trading to the Engli&s;h plan|tations in the We&s;t Indies, as a very uncertain advan|tage. In the Engli&s;h hou&s;es al&s;o it was ob&s;erved, that the union of a rich with a poor nation would always be beneficial to the latter, and that the former could only hope for a participation of their nece&s;&s;ities. It was &s;aid that the Scotch reluctantly yielded to this coali|tion, and that it might be likened to a marriage with a woman again&s;t her con&s;ent. It was &s;uppo&s;ed to be an union made up of &s;o many unmatched pieces, and &s;uch incongruous ingredients, that it could ne|ver take effect. It was complained, that the pro|portion of the land-tax paid by the Scotch was &s;mall, and unequal to their &s;hare in the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>At length, notwith&s;tanding all oppo&s;ition made by the Tories, every article of the union was approved by a great majority in both parliaments.</P>
<P>Thus all were obliged to acquie&s;ce in an union of which they at fir&s;t had not &s;agacity to di&s;tingui&s;h the advantages.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Whig mini&s;try was every day declining. Among the number of tho&s;e whom the du|che&s;s of Marlborough had introduced to the queen, to contribute to her private amu&s;ement, was one Mrs. Ma|&s;ham, her own kin&s;woman, whom &s;he had rai&s;ed from indigence and ob&s;curity. The duche&s;s having gained the a&s;cendant over the queen, became petulant and in&s;olent, and relaxed in tho&s;e arts by which &s;he had ri&s;en. Mrs. Ma&s;ham, who had her fortune to make, was more humble and a&s;&s;iduous; &s;he flattered the foibles of the queen, and a&s;&s;ented to her prepo&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions and prejudices. She &s;oon &s;aw the queen's in|clination to the Tory &s;et of opinions, their divine right and pa&s;&s;ive obedience; and in&s;tead of attempting to thwart her, as the duche&s;s had done, &s;he joined in with her partiality, and even outwent her in her own way.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="299">This lady was in fact the tool of Mr. Harley, &s;e|cretary of &s;tate, who al&s;o &s;ome time before had in&s;i|nuated him&s;elf into the queen's good graces, and who determined to &s;ap the credit of the Whig mi|ni&s;ters His aim was to unite the Tory intere&s;t un|der his own &s;helter, and to expel the Whigs from the advantages which they had long enjoyed under government.</P>
<P>In his career of ambition he cho&s;e for his coadju|tor Henry St. John, afterwards the famous lord Bo|lingbroke, a man of great eloquence, and greater ambition, enterpri&s;ing, re&s;tle&s;s, active, and haughty, with &s;ome wit, and little principle.</P>
<P>To this junto was added Sir Simon Harcourt, a lawyer, a man of great abilities.</P>
<P>It was now perceived that the people them&s;elves began to be weary of the Whig mini&s;try, whom they formerly care&s;&s;ed. To them they imputed the bur|thens under which they groaned, burthens which they had been hitherto animated to bear by the pomp of triumph; but the load of which they felt in a pau&s;e of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Harley, afterwards known by the title of lord Ox|ford, was at the bottom of all the&s;e complaints; and though they did not produce an immediate effect, yet they did not fail of a growing and &s;teady ope|ration.</P>
<P>At length the Whig part of the mini&s;try opened their eyes to the intrigues of the Tories. But it was now too late, they had entirely lo&s;t the confi|dence of the queen.</P>
<P>Harley &s;oon threw off the ma&s;k of friend&s;hip, and took more vigorous mea&s;ures for the pro&s;ecution of his de&s;igns. In him the queen repo&s;ed all her tru&s;t, though he had now no vi&s;ible concern in the admi|ni&s;tration. The fir&s;t triumph of the Tories, in which the queen di&s;covered a public partiality in their favour, was &s;een in a tran&s;action of no great
<PB N="283" REF="300">
importance in it&s;elf, but from the con&s;equences it produced. The parties of the nation were eager to engage, and they wanted but the watch-word to be|gin. This was given by a man neither of abilities, property, or power; but accidentally brought for|ward on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Henry Sacheverel was a clergyman bred at Ox|ford, of narrow intellects, and an overheated ima|gination. He had acquired &s;ome popularity among tho&s;e who di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by the name of high-churchmen, and had taken all occa&s;ions to vent his animo&s;ity again&s;t the di&s;&s;enters. At the &s;ummer a&s;&s;izes at Derby he held forth in that &s;train before the judges. On the fifth of November, in St. Paul's church, he, in a violent declamation, defended the doctrine of non-re&s;i&s;tance, inveighed again&s;t the to|leration of di&s;&s;enters, declared the church was dan|gerou&s;ly attacked by its enemies, and &s;lightly de|fended by its fal&s;e friends. He &s;ounded the trumpet for the zealous, and exhorted the people to put on the whole armour of God. Sir Samuel Gerrard, lord-mayor, countenanced this harangue, which, though very weak both in the matter and &s;tile, was publi&s;hed under his protection, and extolled by the To|ries as a ma&s;ter-piece of writing. The&s;e &s;ermons owed all their celebrity to the complexion of the times, and they are now de&s;ervedly neglected.</P>
<P>Mr. Dolben, &s;on to the archbi&s;hop of York, laid a complaint before the hou&s;e of commons again&s;t the&s;e rhap&s;odies, and thus gave force to what would have &s;oon been forgotten. The mo&s;t violent para|graphs were read, and the &s;ermons voted &s;candalous and &s;editious libels. Sacheverel was brought to the bar of the hou&s;e, and he, far from di&s;owning the writing of them, gloried in what he had done, and mentioned the encouragement he had received to publi&s;h them from the lord-mayor, who was then pre&s;ent. Being ordered to withdraw, it was re&s;olved
<PB N="284" REF="301">
to impeach him of high crimes and mi&s;demeanors at the bar of the hou&s;e of lords; and Mr. Dolben was fixed upon to conduct the pro&s;ecution, in the name of the commons of all England. A commit|tee was appointed to draw up articles of impeach|ment; Sacheverel was taken into cu&s;tody, and a day was appointed for his trial before the lords in We&s;t|min&s;ter-hall.</P>
<P>The eyes of the whole kingdom were turned upon this very extraordinary trial, which la&s;ted three weeks, and excluded all other public bu&s;ine&s;s for the time. The queen her&s;elf was every day pre&s;ent as a private &s;pectator, while va&s;t multitudes attended the culprit each day as he went to the hall, &s;houting as he pa&s;&s;ed, or &s;ilently praying for his &s;ucce&s;s. The managers for the commons were Sir Jo&s;eph Jekyl, Mr. Eyre, &s;olicitor general, Sir Peter King, record|er, general Stanhope, Sir Thomas Parker, and Mr. Walpole. The doctor was defended by Sir Simon Harcourt, and Mr. Phipps, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by doctor Atterbury, doctor Smallridge, and doctor Freind. While the trial continued, nothing could exceed the violence and outrage of the populace. They &s;ur|rounded the queen's &s;edan, exclaiming,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"God ble&s;s your maje&s;ty and the church; we hope your ma|je&s;ty is for doctor Sacheverel."</Q>
They de&s;troyed &s;everal meeting-hou&s;es, plundered the dwellings of many eminent di&s;&s;enters, and even propo&s;ed to at|tack the bank. The queen, in compliance with the reque&s;t of the commons, publi&s;hed a proclamation for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the tumults; and &s;everal per&s;ons be|ing apprehended were tried for high trea&s;on. Two were convicted, and &s;entenced to die, but neither &s;uffered.</P>
<P>When the commons had gone through their charge, the managers for Sacheverel undertook his defence with great art and eloquence. He afterwards recited a &s;peech him&s;elf, which, from the difference
<PB N="285" REF="302">
found between it and his &s;ermons, &s;eems evidently the work of another. In this he &s;olemnly ju&s;tified his intentions towards the queen and her govern|ment. He &s;poke in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful terms of the revolution, and the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. He maintained the doctrine of non-re&s;i&s;tance as a tenet of the church, in which he was brought up; and in a pathetic conclu&s;ion endeavoured to excite the pity of his audience.</P>
<P>At length, after much ob&s;tinate di&s;pute, and vi|rulent altercation, Sacheverel was found guilty, by a majority of &s;eventeen voices; but no le&s;s than four and thirty peers entered a prote&s;t again&s;t this deci&s;ion. He was prohibited from preaching for three years; and his two &s;ermons were ordered to be burned by the hands of the common hangman, in pre&s;ence of the lord-mayor and the two &s;heriffs. The lenity of this &s;entence, which was, in a great mea&s;ure, owing to the dread of popular re&s;entment, was con&s;idered by the Tories as a triumph.</P>
<P>Such was the complexion of the times, when the queen thought proper to &s;ummon a new parliament&punc; and being a friend to the Tories her&s;elf, &s;he gave the people an opportunity of indulging them&s;elves in chu&s;ing repre&s;entatives to their mind. In fact, very few were returned but &s;uch as had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their zeal again&s;t the Whig admini|&s;tration.</P>
<P>In the mean time the campaign in Flanders was conducted with the mo&s;t brilliant &s;ucce&s;s. The duke of Marlborough had every motive to continue the war, as it gratified not only his ambition but his avarice; a pa&s;&s;ion that ob&s;cured his &s;hining abilities.</P>
<P>The king of France appeared extremely de&s;irous of a peace, and re&s;olved to &s;olicit a conference. He employed one Petkum, re&s;ident of the duke of Hol|&s;tein at the Hague, to negotiate upon this &s;ubject, and he ventured al&s;o to &s;olicit the duke him&s;elf in
<PB N="286" REF="303">
private. A conference was at length begun at Ger|truydenburgh, under the influence of Marlborough, Eugene, and Zinzendorff, who were all three, from private motives, entirely aver&s;e to the treaty. Upon this occa&s;ion the French mini&s;ters were &s;ubjected to every &s;pecies of mortification. Spies were placed upon all their conduct. Their ma&s;ter was in&s;ulted, and their letters were opened; till at la&s;t Lewis re&s;olved to hazard another campaign.</P>
<P>It was only by in&s;en&s;ible degrees that the queen &s;eemed to acquire courage enough to &s;econd her inclinations, and depo&s;e a mini&s;try that had long been di&s;agreeable to her. Harley, however, who &s;till &s;hared her confidence, did not fail to inculcate the popularity, the ju&s;tice, and the &s;ecurity of &s;uch a mea&s;ure; and, in con&s;equence of his advice, &s;he began the changes, by transferring the po&s;t of lord chamberlain from the duke of Kent to the duke of Shrew&s;bury, who had lately voted with the Tories, and maintained an intimate corre&s;pondence with Mr. Harley. Soon after the earl of Sunderland, &s;ecre|tary of &s;tate, and &s;on-in-law to the duke of Marlbo|rough was di&s;placed, and the earl of Dartmouth put in his room. Finding that &s;he was rather applauded than condemned for this re&s;olute proceeding, &s;he re|&s;olved to become entirely free.</P>
<P>Soon after the earl of Godolphin was dive&s;ted of his office, and the trea&s;ury put in commi&s;&s;ion, &s;ub|jected to the direction of Harley, who was appointed chancellor of the exchequer, and under trea&s;urer. The earl of Roche&s;ter was declared pre&s;ident of the council, in the room of lord Somers. The &s;taff of lord &s;teward being taken from the duke of Devon|&s;hire, was given to the duke of Buckingham; and Mr. Boyle was removed from the &s;ecretary's office, to make way for Mr. Henry St. John. The lord chancellor having re&s;igned the great &s;eal, it was fir&s;t put in commi&s;&s;ion, and then given to Sir Simon
<PB N="287" REF="304">
Harcourt. The earl of Wharton &s;urrendered his com|mi&s;&s;ion of lord lieutenant of Ireland; and that em|ployment was conferred upon the duke of Ormond. Mr. George Granville was appointed &s;ecretary at war, in the room of Mr. Robert Walpole; and in a word, there was not one Whig left in any office of the &s;tate, except the duke of Marlborough. He was &s;till con|tinued the reluctant general of the army; but he ju&s;t|ly con&s;idered him&s;elf as a ruin entirely undermined, and ju&s;t ready to fall.</P>
<P>But the triumph was not yet complete, until the parliament was brought to confirm and approve the queen's choice. The queen in her &s;peech recom|mended the pro&s;ecution of the war with vigour. The parliament were ardent in their expre&s;&s;ions of zeal and unanimity. They exhorted her to di&s;countenance all &s;uch principles and mea&s;ures, as had lately threat|ened her royal crown and dignity. This was but an opening to what &s;oon after followed. The duke of Marlborough, who but a few months before had been &s;o highly extolled and care&s;&s;ed by the repre&s;entatives of the people, was now become the object of their ha|tred and reproach. His avarice was ju&s;tly upbraided; his protracting the war was &s;aid to ari&s;e from that mo|tive. In&s;tances were every where given of his fraud and extortion. The&s;e might be true, but party had no moderation, and even his courage and conduct were called in que&s;tion. To mortify the duke &s;till more, the thanks of the hou&s;e of commons were voted to the earl of Peterborough for his &s;ervices in Spain, when they were refu&s;ed to the duke for tho&s;e in Flan|ders; and the lord keeper, who delivered them to Pe|terborough, took occa&s;ion to drop &s;ome reflections again&s;t the mercenary di&s;po&s;ition of his rival.</P>
<P>Nothing now, therefore, remained of the Whig &s;y&s;tem, upon which this reign was begun, but the war, which continued to rage as fierce as ever, and which increa&s;ed in expence every year as it went on.
<PB N="288" REF="305">
It was the re&s;olution of the pre&s;ent mini&s;try to put an end to it at any rate, as it had involved the nation in debt almo&s;t to bankruptcy; and as it promi&s;ed, in&s;tead of humbling the enemy, only to become habitual to the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>It only remained to remove the duke of Marlbo|rough from his po&s;t, as he would endeavour to tra|ver&s;e all their negotiations. But here again a diffi|culty &s;tarted, this &s;tep could not be taken without giving offence to the Dutch, who placed entire con|fidence in him; they were obliged, therefore, to wait for &s;ome convenient occa&s;ion. Upon his return from this campaign he was accu&s;ed of having taken a bribe of &s;ix thou&s;and pounds a year from a Jew, who contracted to &s;upply the army with bread; and the queen thought proper to di&s;mi&s;s him from all his employments. This was the pretext made u&s;e of, though his fall had been predetermined; and though his receiving &s;uch a bribe was not the real cau&s;e of his removal, yet candour mu&s;t confe&s;s that it ought to have been &s;o.</P>
<P>In the mean time Prior, much more famous as a poet than as a &s;tate&s;man, was &s;ent over with propo|&s;als to France; and Menager, a man of no great &s;tation, returned with Prior to London, with full powers to treat upon the preliminaries.</P>
<P>The mini&s;try having got thus far, the great diffi|culty &s;till lay before them, of making the terms of peace agreeable to all the confederates. The earl of Stafford, who had been lately recalled from the Hague, where he re&s;ided as amba&s;&s;ador, was now &s;ent back to Holland, with orders to communicate to the pen&s;ionary Hein&s;ius, the preliminary propo&s;als, to &s;ignify the queen's approbation of them, and to propo&s;e a place where the plenipotentiaries &s;hould a&s;|&s;emble. The Dutch were very aver&s;e to begin the conference, upon the in&s;pection of the preliminaries. They &s;ent over an envoy to attempt to turn the
<PB N="289" REF="306">
queen from her re&s;olution, but finding their efforts vain, they fixed upon Utrecht as the place of general conference, and they granted pa&s;&s;ports to the French mini&s;ters accordingly.</P>
<P>The conferences began at Utrecht, under the con|duct of Robin&s;on, bi&s;hop of Bri&s;tol, lord privy-&s;eal, and the earl of Stafford, on the &s;ide of the Engli&s;h&punc; of Buys and Vanderdu&s;&s;en on the part of the Dutch; and of the mar&s;hal D'Uxelles, the cardinal Polig|nac, and Mr. Menager, in behalf of France. The mini&s;ters of the emperor and Savoy a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and the other allies &s;ent al&s;o plenipotentiaries, though with the utmo&s;t reluctance. As England and France, were the only two powers that were &s;eriou&s;ly inclined to peace, it may be &s;uppo&s;ed that all the other deputies &s;erved rather to retard than advance its progre&s;s. They met rather to &s;tart new difficulties, and widen the breach, than to quiet the di&s;&s;entions of Eu|rope.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h mini&s;ters therefore, finding multiplied ob&s;tructions from the deliberations of their allies, &s;et on foot a private negotiation with France. They &s;tipulated certain advantages for the &s;ubjects of Great Britain in a concerted plan of peace. They re&s;olved to enter into &s;uch mutual confidence with the French, as would anticipate all clande&s;tine tran&s;actions to the prejudice of the coalition.</P>
<P>In the beginning of Augu&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1712.</NOTE> &s;ecretary St. John, who had been created lord vi&s;|count Bolingbroke, was &s;ent to the court of Ver&s;ailles to remove all ob&s;tructions to the &s;eparate treaty. He was accompanied by Mr. Prior, and the abb&eacute; Gualtier, and treated with the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed marks of re&s;pect. He was care&s;&s;ed by the French king, and the marquis de Torcy, with whom he ad|ju&s;ted the principal intere&s;ts of the duke of Savoy, and the elector of Bavaria.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="307">At length the treaties of peace and commerce be|tween England and France being agreed on by the plenipotentiaries on either &s;ide, and ratified by the queen, &s;he acquainted her parliament of the &s;teps &s;he had taken.</P>
<P>The articles of this famous treaty were longer canva&s;&s;ed, and more warmly debated, than tho&s;e of any other treaty read of in hi&s;tory. The number of different intere&s;ts concerned, and the great enmity and jealou&s;y &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between all, made it impo&s;&s;ible that all could be &s;atisfied; and indeed there &s;eemed no other method of obtaining peace, but that which was taken, for the two principal powers concerned to make their own articles, and to leave the re&s;t for a &s;ub|ject of future di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;tipulation was, that Philip, now ac|knowledged king of Spain, &s;hould renounce all right to the crown of France, the union of two &s;uch power|ful kingdoms being thought dangerous to the liberties of Europe. It was agreed that the duke of Berry, Philip's brother, and after him in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, &s;hould al&s;o renounce his right to the crown of Spain, in ca&s;e he became king of France. It was &s;tipulated that the duke of Savoy &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the i&s;land of Si|cily, with the title of king, together with Fene&s;trelles, and other places on the continent, which increa&s;e of dominion was in &s;ome mea&s;ure made out of the &s;poils of the French monarchy. The Dutch had that bar|rier granted them, which they &s;o long &s;ought after; and if the crown of France was deprived of &s;ome do|minions to enrich the duke of Savoy, on the other hand the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria was taxed to &s;upply the wants of the Hollanders, who were put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;tronge&s;t towns in Flanders. With regard to England, its glory and its intere&s;ts were &s;ecured. The fortifications of Dunkirk, an harbour that might be dangerous to their trade in time of war, were ordered to be demoli&s;hed, and its port de&s;troyed. Spain gave
<PB N="291" REF="308">
up all right to Gibraltar, and the i&s;land of Minorca. France re&s;igned her preten&s;ions to Hud&s;on's Bay, No|va Scotia, and Newfoundland; but they were left in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Cape Breton, and the liberty of drying their fi&s;h upon the &s;hore. Among tho&s;e articles, glo|rious to the Engli&s;h nation, their &s;etting free the French prote&s;tants, confined in the pri&s;ons and gallies for their religion was not the lea&s;t merito|rious. For the emperor it was &s;tipulated, that he &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the kingdom of Naples, the duchy of Milan, and the Spani&s;h Netherlands. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia was to have Upper Guelder; and a time was fixed for the Emperor's acceding to the&s;e articles, as he had for &s;ome time ob&s;titately refu&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the negociation. Thus Europe &s;eemed to be formed into one great republic, the different members of which were cantoned out to different governors, and the ambition of any one &s;tate, amenable to the tribunal of all. Thus it appears that the Engli&s;h mini&s;try did ju&s;tice to all the world; but their country denied that ju&s;tice to them.</P>
<P>But while the Whigs were attacking the Tory mini&s;ters from without, the&s;e were in much greater danger from their own internal di&s;&s;en&s;ions. Lord Oxford, and lord Bolingbroke, though they had &s;tarted with the &s;ame principles and de&s;igns, yet having vanqui&s;hed other oppo&s;ers, now began to turn their &s;trength again&s;t each other. Both began to form &s;e|parate intere&s;ts, and to adopt different principles. Oxford's plan was the more moderate, Bolingbroke's the more vigorous, but the more &s;ecure. Oxford it is thought was entirely for the Hanover &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; Bolingbroke had &s;ome hopes of bringing in the Pre|tender. But though they hated each other mo&s;t &s;in|cerely, yet they were for a while kept together by the good offices of their friends and adherents, who had the melancholy pro&s;pect of &s;eeing the citadel of their
<PB N="292" REF="309">
hopes, while openly be&s;ieged from without, &s;ecretly undermining within.</P>
<P>This was a mortifying pro&s;pect to the Tories; but it was more particularly di&s;plea&s;ing to the queen, who daily &s;aw her favourite mini&s;try declining, while her own health kept pace with their contentions. Her con&s;titution was now quite broken. One fit of &s;ick|ne&s;s &s;ucceeded another; and what completed the ruin of her health, was the anxiety of her mind. The&s;e di&s;&s;en&s;ions had &s;uch an effect upon her &s;pirits and con&s;titution, that &s;he declared &s;he could not out|live it, and immediately &s;unk into a &s;tate of lethargic in&s;en&s;ibility. Notwith&s;tanding all the medicines which the phy&s;icians could pre&s;cribe, the di&s;temper gained ground &s;o fa&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 30. 1714.</NOTE> that the day after they de&s;paired of her life, and the privy-council was a&s;&s;embled on the occa|&s;ion.</P>
<P>All the members without di&s;tinction, being &s;um|moned from the different parts of the kingdom, be|gan to provide for the &s;ecurity of the con&s;titution. They &s;ent a letter to the elector of Hanover inform|ing him of the queen's de&s;perate &s;ituation, and de&s;ir|ing him to repair to Holland, where he would be at|tended by a Briti&s;h &s;quadron to convey him to Eng|land. At the &s;ame time they di&s;patched in&s;tructions to the earl of Strafford at the Hague, to de&s;ire the &s;tates-general to be ready, to perform the guaranty of the Prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Precautions were taken to &s;ecure the &s;ea-ports; and the command of the fleet was be&s;towed upon the earl of Berkeley, a profe&s;&s;ed Whig. The&s;e mea&s;ures, which were all dictated by that party, an&s;wered a double end. It argued their own alacrity in the cau&s;e of their new &s;overeign, and &s;eemed to imply a danger to the &s;tate from the di&s;af|fection of the oppo&s;ite intere&s;t.</P>
<P>On the thirtieth of July, the queen &s;eemed &s;ome|what relieved by medicines, ro&s;e from her bed about
<PB N="293" REF="310">
eight o'clock, and walked a little. After &s;ome time, ca&s;ting her eyes on a clock that &s;tood in her chamber, &s;he continued to gaze at it for &s;ome minutes. One of the ladies in waiting a&s;ked her what &s;he &s;aw there more than u&s;ual; to which the queen only an&s;wer|ed, by turning her eyes upon her with a dying look. She was &s;oon after &s;eized with a fit of the apoplexy: &s;he continued all night in a &s;tate of &s;tupefaction, and expired the following morning, in the forty-ninth year of her age. She reigned more than twelve years over a people that was now ri&s;en to the highe&s;t pitch of refinement; that had attained by their wi&s;|dom all the advantages of opulence, and by their va|lour all the happine&s;s of &s;ecurity and conque&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIV. GEORGE I.</HEAD>
<P>PURSUANT to the act of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, George the fir&s;t, &s;on of Erne&s;t Augu&s;tus, fir&s;t elector of Brun&s;wick, and the prince&s;s Sophia, grand-daughter to James the fir&s;t, a&s;cended the Briti&s;h throne. His mature age, he being now fifty-four years old, his &s;agacity and experience, his numerous alliances, the general tranquility of Europe, all contributed to e&s;|tabli&s;h his intere&s;ts, and to promi&s;e him a peaceable and happy reign. His virtues, though not &s;hining, were &s;olid; he was of a very different di&s;po&s;ition from the Stuart family, whom he &s;ucceeded. The&s;e were known, to a proverb, for leaving their friends in extremity; George, on the contrary, &s;oon after his arrival in England, was heard to &s;ay; "My max|im is, never to abandon my friends. To do ju&s;tice to all the world, and to fear no man" To the&s;e qualifications of re&s;olution and per&s;everance, he joined great application to bu&s;ine&s;s. However, one
<PB N="294" REF="311">
fault with re&s;pect to England remained behind; he &s;tudied the intere&s;ts of tho&s;e &s;ubjects he had left, more than tho&s;e he came to govern.</P>
<P>The queen had no &s;ooner re&s;igned her la&s;t breath, that the privy-council met, and three in&s;truments were produced, by which the elector appointed &s;eve|ral of his known adherents to be added as lords ju&s;|tices to the &s;even great offices of the kingdom. Or|ders al&s;o were immediately i&s;&s;ued out for proclaiming George king of England, Scotland, and Ireland. The regency appointed the earl of Dor&s;et to carry him the intimation of his acce&s;&s;ion to the crown, and to attend him in his journey to England. They &s;ent the general officers, in whom they could confide, to their po&s;ts; they reinforced the garri&s;on of Port&s;|mouth, and appointed the celebrated Mr. Addi&s;on &s;ecretary of &s;tate. To mortify the late mini&s;try the more, lord Bolingbroke was obliged to wait every morning in the pa&s;&s;age, among the &s;ervants, with his bag of papers, where there were per&s;ons purpo&s;e|ly placed to in&s;ult and deride him. No tumult ap|peared, no commotion aro&s;e again&s;t the acce&s;&s;ion of the new king, and this gave a &s;trong proof that no rational mea&s;ures were ever taken to ob&s;truct his ex|altation.</P>
<P>When he fir&s;t landed at Greenwich, he was re|ceived by the duke of Northumberland, captain of the life-guard, and the lords of the regency. When he retired to his bed-chamber, he then &s;ent for &s;uch of the nobility as had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their zeal for his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. But the duke of Ormond, the lord chancellor, and the lord trea&s;urer, found them&s;elves excluded.</P>
<P>The king of a faction is but the &s;overeign of half his &s;ubjects. Of this, however, the new-elected mon|arch did not &s;eem &s;en&s;ible. It was his misfortune, and con&s;equently that of the nation, that he was hemmed round by men, who &s;oured him with all
<PB N="295" REF="312">
their own intere&s;ts and prejudices. None now but the leaders of a party were admitted into employ|ment. The Whigs while they pretended to &s;ecure the crown for their king, were with all po&s;&s;ible arts confirming their own intere&s;ts, extending their con|nexions, and giving laws to their &s;overeign. An in|&s;tantaneous and total change was made in all the of|fices of tru&s;t, honour, or advantage. The Whigs governed the &s;enate and the court; whom they would, they opppre&s;&s;ed; bound the lower orders of people with &s;evere laws, and kept them at a di&s;tance by vile di&s;tinctions; and then taught them to call this&mdash;Liberty.</P>
<P>The&s;e partialities &s;oon rai&s;ed di&s;contents among the people, and the king's attachment con&s;iderably encrea&s;ed the malecontents through all the kingdom. The clamour of the church's being in danger was revived, and the people only &s;eemed to want a leader to incite them to in&s;urrection. Birmingham, Bri&s;|tol, Norwich, and Reading, &s;till remembered the &s;pirit with which they had declared for Sacheverel; and now the cry was, Down with the Whigs, and Sacheverel for ever.</P>
<P>Upon the fir&s;t meeting of the new par|liament, in which the Whigs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1714.</NOTE> with the king at their head, were predominant, no|thing was expected but the mo&s;t violent mea&s;ures again&s;t the late mini&s;try, nor were the ex|pectations of mankind di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>The lords profe&s;&s;ed their hopes that the king would be able to recover the reputation of the king|dom on the continent, the lo&s;s of which they affected to deplore. The commons went much farther: they declared their re&s;olution to trace out tho&s;e mea&s;ures by which the country was depre&s;&s;ed: they re&s;olved to &s;eek after tho&s;e abettors on whom the pretender &s;eemed to ground his hopes; and they determined to bring &s;uch to condign puni&s;hment.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="313">It was the artifice, during this and the &s;ucceeding reign, to &s;tigmatize all tho&s;e who te&s;tified their di&s;|content again&s;t government, as Papi&s;ts and Jacobites. All who ventured to &s;peak again&s;t the violence of their mea&s;ures, were reproached as de&s;igning to bring in the pretender; and mo&s;t people were con|&s;equently afraid to murmur, &s;ince di&s;content was &s;o near a-kin to trea&s;on. The people, therefore, be|held the violence of their conduct in &s;ilent fright, in|ternally di&s;approving, yet not daring to avow their dete&s;tation.</P>
<P>A committee was appointed, con&s;i&s;ting of twenty per&s;ons, to in&s;pect all the papers relative to the late negociation for peace; and to pick out &s;uch of them as might &s;erve as &s;ubjects of accu&s;ation again&s;t the late mini&s;try. After &s;ome time &s;pent in this di&s;qui|&s;ition, Mr. Walpole, as chairman of the committee, declared to the hou&s;e that a report was drawn up; and in the mean time, moved that a warrant might be i&s;&s;ued for apprehending Mr. Matthew Prior, and Mr. Thomas Harley, who being in the hou&s;e, were immediately taken into cu&s;tody. He then impeached lord Bolingbroke of high trea&s;on. This &s;truck &s;ome of the members with amazement; but they were &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hed, when lord Coning&s;by, ri&s;ing up, was heard to &s;ay,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The worthy chairman has impeached the hand, but I impeach the head; he has impeached the &s;cholar, and I the ma&s;ter. I impeach Robert earl of Oxford, and earl Morti|mer, of high trea&s;on, and other crimes and mi&s;de|meanors."</Q></P>
<P>When lord Oxford appeared in the hou&s;e of lords, the day following, he was avoided by the peers as in|fectious; and he had now an opportunity of di&s;cover|ing the ba&s;ene&s;s of mankind. When the articles were read again&s;t him in the hou&s;e of commons, a warm debate aro&s;e upon that in which he was charged with having advi&s;ed the French king of the manner
<PB N="297" REF="314">
of gaining Tournay from the Dutch. Mr. Walpole alledged that it was trea&s;on. Sir Jo&s;eph Jekyl, a known Whig, &s;aid that he could never be of opinion that it amounted to trea&s;on. It was his principle, he &s;aid, to do ju&s;tice to all men, to the highe&s;t and the lowe&s;t. He hoped he might pretend to &s;ome know|ledge of the laws, and would not &s;cruple to declare upon this part of the que&s;tion in favour of the crimi|nal. To this Walpole an&s;wered, with great warmth, that there were &s;everal per&s;ons both in and out of the committee, who did not in the lea&s;t yield to that member in point of hone&s;ty, exceeded him in the knowledge of the laws, and yet were &s;atisfied that the charge in that article amounted to high trea&s;on. This point being decided again&s;t the earl, and the other articles, approved by the hou&s;e, the lord Coning&s;by, attended by the Whig members, impeached him &s;oon after at the bar of the hou&s;e of lords, demand|ing, at the &s;ame time, that he might lo&s;e his &s;eat, and be committed to cu&s;tody. When this point came to be debated in the hou&s;e of lords, a violent altercation en&s;ued. Tho&s;e who &s;till adhered to the depo&s;ed mini&s;ter, maintained the inju&s;tice and the dan|ger of &s;uch a proceeding. At la&s;t the earl him&s;elf ro&s;e up, and with great tranquility ob&s;erved, That for his own part he always acted by the immediate directions and command of the queen, his mi&s;tre&s;s&punc; he had never offended again&s;t any known law, and was unconcerned for the life of an in&s;ignificant old man.</P>
<P>Next day he was brought to the bar, where be re|ceived a copy of his impeachment, and was allowed a month to prepare his an&s;wer. Though Dr. Mead declared that if the earl &s;hould be &s;ent to the Tower, his life would be in danger, it was carried in the hou&s;e that &s;hould be committed.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time the duke of Ormond and lord Bolingbroke having omitted to &s;urrender them&s;elves,
<PB N="298" REF="315">
for they had actually, fled to the continent, within a limited time, it was ordered that the earl mar&s;hal &s;hould raze out their names and arms from among the li&s;t of peers, and inventories were taken of their e&s;|tates and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, which were declared forfeited to the crown.</P>
<P>Lord Oxford being confined in the Tower, he continued there for two years, during which time the nation was in a continual ferment, from an actual rebellion that was carried on un&s;ucce&s;sfully. After the execution of &s;ome lords, who were taken in arms, the nation &s;eemed glutted with blood, and that was the time that lord Oxford petitioned to be brought to his trial. He knew that the fury of the nation was &s;pent on objects that were really culpable, and expected that his ca&s;e would look like innocence it|&s;elf, when compared to theirs. A day, therefore, at his own reque&s;t was a&s;&s;igned him, and the commons were ordered to prepare for their charge. At the appointed time the peers repaired to the court in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, where lord Cowper pre&s;ided as lord high-&s;teward. But a di&s;pute ari&s;ing between the lords and commons, concerning the mode of his trial, the lords voted that the pri&s;oner &s;hould be &s;et at liberty. To this di&s;pute he probably owed the &s;ecurity of his title and fortune, for as to the articles, importing him guilty of high trea&s;on, they were at once malignant and frivolous; &s;o that his life was in no mannner of danger.</P>
<P>In the mean time the&s;e vindictive proceedings ex|cited the indignation of the people, who perceived that the avenues to royal favour were clo&s;ed again&s;t all but a faction. The flames of rebellion were ac|tually kindled in Scotland. The earl of Mar a&s;&s;em|bling three hundred of his own va&s;&s;als in the High|lands, proclaimed the pretender at Ca&s;tletown, and &s;et up his &s;tandard at a place called Braemaer, a&s;|&s;uming the title of lieutenant-general of his maje&s;ty's
<PB N="299" REF="316">
forces. To &s;econd the&s;e attempts, two ve&s;&s;els arrived in Scotland from France, with arms, ammunition, and a number of officers, together with a&s;&s;urances to the earl, that the pretender him&s;elf would &s;hortly come over to head his own forces. The earl, in con&s;e|quence of this promi&s;e, &s;oon found him&s;elf at the head of ten thou&s;and men, well armed and provided.</P>
<P>The duke of Argyle, apprized of his intentions, and at any rate willing to prove his attachment to the pre&s;ent government, re&s;olved to give him battle in the neighbourhood of Dumblain, though his forces did not amount to half the number of the enemy. After an engagement which continued &s;everal hours, in the evening, both &s;ides drew off, and both &s;ides claimed the victory. Though the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the field was kept by neither, yet certainly all the ho|nour and all the advantages of the day belonged only to the duke of Argyle. It was &s;ufficient for him to have interrupted the progre&s;s of the enemy; for in their circum&s;tances, delay was defeat. The earl of Mar &s;oon found his di&s;appointments and his lo&s;&s;es encrea&s;e. The ca&s;tle of Inverne&s;s, of which he was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, was delivered up to the king by lord Lovat, who had hitherto profe&s;&s;ed to act in the inte|re&s;t of the pretender. The marquis of Tullibardine for&s;ook the earl, in order to defend his own part of the country; and many of the clans, &s;eeing no like|lihood of coming &s;oon to a &s;econd engagement, re|turned quietly home; for an irregular army is much ea&s;ier led to battle than induced to bear the fatigues of a campaign.</P>
<P>In the mean time the rebellion was &s;till more un|&s;ucce&s;sfully pro&s;ecuted in England. From the time the pretender had undertaken this wild project at Paris, in which the duke of Ormond and lord Bo|lingbroke were engaged, lord Stair, the Engli&s;h am|ba&s;&s;ador there, had penetrated all his de&s;igns, and &s;ent faithful accounts of all his mea&s;ures, and all
<PB N="300" REF="317">
his adherents, to the mini&s;try at home. Upon the fir&s;t rumour, therefore, of an in&s;urrection, they im|pri&s;oned &s;everal lords and gentlemen, of whom they had a &s;u&s;picion. The earls of Home, Wintown, and Kinnoul, and others, were committed to the ca&s;|tle of Edinburgh. The king obtained leave from the lower hou&s;e to &s;eize Sir William Wyndham, Sir John Packington, Harvey, Combe, and others. The lords Land&s;down and Duplin were taken into cu&s;to|dy. Sir William Wyndham's father-in-law, the duke of Somer&s;et, offered to become bound for his appearance, but his &s;urety was refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>But all the&s;e precautions were not able to &s;top the in&s;urrection in the we&s;tern counties, where it was already begun. However, all their preparations were weak and ill conducted, every mea&s;ure was betrayed to government as &s;oon as projected, and many revolts repre&s;&s;ed in the very out&s;et. The univer&s;ity of Ox|ford was treated with great &s;everity on this occa&s;ion. Major general Pepper, with a &s;trong detachment of dragoons, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city at day break, declaring he would in&s;tantly &s;hoot any of the &s;tu|dents who &s;hould pre&s;ume to appear without the li|mits of their re&s;pective colleges. The in&s;urrection in the northern counties came to greater maturity.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1715.</NOTE> In the month of October the earl of Derwentwater and Mr. For&s;ter took the field with a body of hor&s;e, and being joined by &s;ome gentlemen from the borders of Scotland, proclaimed the pretender. Their fir&s;t attempt was to &s;eize upon Newca&s;tle, in which they had many friends, but they found the gates &s;hut again&s;t them, and were obliged to retire to Hexham. To oppo&s;e the&s;e, general Carpenter was detached by government, with a body of nine hundred men, and an engagement was hourly expected. The rebels had proceeded, by the way of Kendal and Lanca&s;ter, to Pre&s;ton, of which place they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion with|out
<PB N="301" REF="318">
any re&s;i&s;tance. But this was the la&s;t &s;tage of their ill advi&s;ed incur&s;ion; for general Wills, at the head of &s;even thou&s;and men, came up to the town to attack them, and from his activity there was no e&s;caping. They now, therefore, began to rai&s;e bar|ricadoes, and to put the place in a po&s;ture of de|fence, repul&s;ing the fir&s;t attack of the royal army with &s;ucce&s;s. Next day, however, Wills was rein|forced by Carpenter, and the town was inve&s;ted on all &s;ides. In this deplorable &s;ituation, to which they were reduced by their own ra&s;hne&s;s, For&s;ter hoped to capitulate with the general, and accordingly &s;ent colonel Oxburgh, who had been taken pri&s;oner, with a trumpeter, to propo&s;e a capitulation. This, how|ever, Wills refu&s;ed, alledging that he would not treat with rebels, and that the only favour they had to expect was to be &s;pared from immediate &s;laughter. The&s;e were hard terms, but no better could be ob|tained They accordingly laid down their arms, and were put under a &s;trong guard; all the noblemen and leaders were &s;ecured, and a few of their officers tried for de&s;erting from the royal army, and &s;hot by order of a court-martial. The common men were impri&s;oned at Che&s;ter and Liverpool; the noblemen and con&s;iderable officers were &s;ent to London, and led through the &s;treets, pinioned and bound toge|ther, to intimidate their party.</P>
<P>The pretender might by this time have been con|vinced of the vanity of his expectations, in &s;uppo&s;|ing that the whole country would ri&s;e up in his cau&s;e. His affairs were actually de&s;perate; yet, with his u&s;ual infatuation, he re&s;olved to hazard his per&s;on among his friends in Scotland, at a time when &s;uch a mea&s;ure was too late for &s;ucce&s;s. Pa&s;&s;ing, there|fore, through France in di&s;gui&s;e, and embarking in a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el at Dunkirk, he arrived, after a voyage of a few days, on the coa&s;ts of Scotland, with only &s;ix gentlemen in his train. He pa&s;&s;ed unknown
<PB N="302" REF="319">
through Aberdeen to Fetero&s;&s;e, where he was met by the earl of Mar, and about thirty noblemen and gentlemen of the fir&s;t quality. There he was &s;o|lemnly proclaimed. His declaration, dated at Com|mercy, was printed and di&s;per&s;ed. He went from thence to Dundee, where he made a public entry, and in two days more he arrived at Scoon, where he intended to have the ceremony of his coronation performed. He ordered thank&s;givings to be made for his &s;afe arrival; he enjoined the mini&s;ters to pray for him in their churches; and, without the &s;malle&s;t &s;hare of power, went through the ceremonies of royalty, which threw an air of ridicule on all his conduct. Having thus &s;pent &s;ome time in unimport|ant parade, he re&s;olved to abandon the enterprize with the &s;ame levity with which it was undertaken. Having made a &s;peech to his grand council, he in|formed them of his want of money, arms, and am|munition, for undertaking a campaign, and therefore deplored that he was compelled to leave them. He once more embarked on board a &s;mall French &s;hip that lay in the harbour of Montro&s;e, accompanied with &s;everal lords, his adherents, and in five days arrived at Graveline.</P>
<P>In this manner ended a rebellion which nothing but imbecility could project, and nothing but ra&s;h|ne&s;s could &s;upport. But though the enemy was now no more, the fury of the victors did not &s;eem in the lea&s;t to abate with &s;ucce&s;s. The law was now put in force with all its terrors; and the pri&s;ons of Lon|don were crowded with tho&s;e deluded wretches, whom the mini&s;try &s;eemed re&s;olved not to pardon. The commons, in their addre&s;s to the crown, de|clared they would pro&s;ecute, in the mo&s;t rigorous manner, the authors of the late rebellion. In con|&s;equence of which the earls of Derwentwater, Ni|thi&s;dale, Carnwarth, and Wintown, the lords Wi|drington, Kenmuir, and Nairne were impeached,
<PB N="303" REF="320">
and upon pleading guilty, all but lord Wintown, re|ceived &s;entence of death. No entreaties could &s;often the mini&s;try to &s;pare the&s;e unhappy men.</P>
<P>Orders were di&s;patched for executing the lords Derwentwater, Nithi&s;dale, and Kenmuir immedi|ately; the re&s;t were re&s;pited to a farther time. Ni|thi&s;dale, however, had the good fortune to e&s;cape in woman's cloaths, which were brought him by his mother the night before his execution. Derwentwa|ter and Kenmuir were brought to the &s;caffold on Tower-hill at the time appointed. Both underwent their &s;entence with calm intrepidity, pitied by all, and &s;eemingly le&s;s moved them&s;elves than tho&s;e who beheld them.</P>
<P>In the beginning of April commi&s;&s;ioners for try|ing the rebels met in the court of common pleas, when the bills were found again&s;t Mr. For&s;ter, Mr. Mackinto&s;h, and twenty of their confederates.</P>
<P>For&s;ter e&s;caped from Newgate, and reached the continent in &s;afety, the re&s;t pleaded not guilty. Pitts, the keeper of Newgate, being &s;u&s;pected of having connived at For&s;ter's e&s;cape, was tried for his life, but acquitted. Yet, notwith&s;tanding this, Mackin|to&s;h and &s;everal other pri&s;oners broke from Newgate, after having ma&s;tered the keeper and turn key, and di&s;armed the centinel. The court proceeded to the trial of tho&s;e that remained; four or five were hang|ed, drawn, and quartered, at Tyburn; two and twenty were executed at Pre&s;ton and Manche&s;ter; and about a thou&s;and pri&s;oners experienced the king's mercy, if &s;uch it might be called, to be tran&s;ported to North America.</P>
<P>A rupture with Spain, which en&s;ued &s;ome time after, &s;erved once more to rai&s;e the declining expec|tations of the pretender and his adherents. It was hoped that, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of cardinal Alberoni, the Spani&s;h mini&s;ter, a new in&s;urrection might be excited in England. The duke of Ormond was the
<PB N="304" REF="321">
per&s;on fixed upon to conduct this expedition; and he obtained from the Spani&s;h court a fleet of ten &s;hips of war and tran&s;ports, having on board &s;ix thou&s;and regular troops, with arms for twelve thou&s;and more. But fortune was &s;till as unfavourable as ever. Hav|ing &s;et &s;ail, and proceeded as far as cape Fini&s;terre, he was encountered by a violent &s;torm, which di&s;a|bled his fleet, and fru&s;trated the expedition. This misfortune, together with the bad &s;ucce&s;s of the Spa|ni&s;h arms in Sicily, and other parts of Europe, in|duced Philip to wi&s;h for peace; and he at la&s;t con|&s;ented to &s;ign the quadruple alliance. This was at that time thought an immen&s;e acqui&s;ition, but Eng|land, though &s;he procured the ratification, had no &s;hare in the advantage of the treaty.</P>
<P>It was about this time that one John Law, a Scotchman,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1721.</NOTE> had cheated France, by erect|ing a company under the name of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, which promi&s;ed that deluded people great wealth, but which ended in involving the French nation in great di&s;tre&s;s. It was now that the people of England were deceived by a project entirely &s;imilar, which is remembered by the name of the South-&s;ea &s;cheme, and which was felt long after by thou&s;ands. To explain this as conci&s;ely as po&s;&s;ible, it is to be ob&s;erved, that ever &s;ince the re|volution under king William, the government not having &s;ufficient &s;upplies granted by parliament, or what was granted requiring time to be, collected, they were obliged to borrow money from &s;everal dif|ferent companies of merchants, and, among the re&s;t, from that company which traded to the South &s;ea. The South-&s;ea company having made up their debt to the government ten millions, in&s;tead of &s;ix hun|dred thou&s;and pounds, which they u&s;ually received as intere&s;t, were &s;atisfied with five hundred thou&s;and.</P>
<P>It was in this &s;ituation of things that one Blount, who had been bred a &s;crivener, and was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
<PB N="305" REF="322">
all the cunning and plau&s;ibility requi&s;ite for &s;uch an undertaking, propo&s;ed to the mini&s;try, in the name of the South-&s;ea company, to buy up all the debts of the different companies of merchants, and thus to become the &s;ole creditor of the &s;tate. The terms he offered to government were extremely advanta|geous. The South-&s;ea company was to redeem the debts of the nation out of the hands of the private proprietors, who were creditors to the government, upon whatever terms they could agree on; and for the intere&s;t of this money, which they had thus re|deemed, and taken into their own hands, they would be contented to be allowed by government, for &s;ix years, five per cent. then the intere&s;t &s;hould be reduced to four per cent. and &s;hould at any time be redeema|ble by parliament. But now came the part of the &s;cheme big with fraud and ruin. As the directors of the South-&s;ea company could not of them&s;elves be &s;uppo&s;ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s money &s;ufficient to buy up the debts of the nation, they were empowered to rai&s;e it by opening a &s;ub&s;cription to a &s;cheme for trading in the South-&s;eas, from which commerce immen&s;e ideal advantages were promi&s;ed by the cunning directors, and &s;till greater expected by the rapacious credulity of the people. All people, therefore, who were creditors to government, were invited to come in, and exchange their &s;tock for that of the South-&s;ea company.</P>
<P>The directors books were no &s;ooner opened for the fir&s;t &s;ub&s;cription, but crowds came to make the exchange of their other &s;tock for South-&s;ea &s;tock. The delu&s;ion was artfully continued and &s;pread. Sub|&s;criptions in a few days &s;old for double the price they had been bought at. The &s;cheme &s;ucceeded even beyond the projectors hopes, and the whole nation was infected with a &s;pirit of avaricious enterprize. The infatuation prevailed; the &s;tock encrea&s;ed to a
<PB N="306" REF="323">
&s;urpri&s;ing degree, and to near ten times the value of what it was fir&s;t &s;ub&s;cribed for.</P>
<P>After a few months, however, the people waked from their dream of riches, and found that all the advantages they expected were merely imaginary, while thou&s;ands of families were involved in one common ruin.</P>
<P>The principal delinquents were puni&s;hed by par|liament with a forfeiture of all &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and e&s;tates as they had acquired during the continuance of this popular frenzy, and &s;ome care was al&s;o taken to redre&s;s the &s;ufferers.</P>
<P>The di&s;contents occa&s;ioned by the&s;e public cala|mities once more gave the di&s;affected party hopes of &s;ucceeding. But in all their coun&s;els they were weak, divided, and wavering.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t per&s;on who was &s;eized upon &s;u&s;picion was Francis Atterbury, bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, a pre|late long obnoxious to the pre&s;ent government, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of abilities to render him formidable to any mini&s;try he oppo&s;ed. His papers were &s;eized, and he him&s;elf confined to the tower. Soon after the duke of Norfolk, the earl of Orrery, the lord North and Grey, and &s;ome others of inferior rank, were arre&s;ted and impri&s;oned. Of all the&s;e, however, only the bi&s;hop, who was bani&s;hed, and one Mr. Layer, who was hanged at Tyburn, felt the &s;everity of government, the proofs again&s;t the re&s;t amounting to no convictive evidence.</P>
<P>The commons about this time finding many abu&s;es had crept into the court of chancery, which either impeded ju&s;tice, or rendered it venal, they re&s;olved to impeach the chancellor Thomas, earl of Maccle&s;|field, at the bar of the hou&s;e of lords, for high crimes and mi&s;demeanors. This was one of the mo&s;t la|borious and be&s;t conte&s;ted trials in the annals of Eng|land. The trial la&s;ted twenty days. The earl proved that the &s;ums he received for the &s;ale of places in
<PB N="307" REF="324">
chancery had been u&s;ually received by former lord chancellors, and rea&s;on told that &s;uch receipts were contrary to &s;trict ju&s;tice. Equity, therefore, pre|vailed above precedent; the earl was convicted of fraudulent practices, and condemned to a fine of thir|ty thou&s;and pounds, with impri&s;onment until that &s;um &s;hould be paid, which was accordingly di&s;charged in about &s;ix weeks after.</P>
<P>In this manner, the corruption, venality, and ava|rice of the times, had encrea&s;ed with the riches and luxury of the nation. Commerce introduced fraud, and wealth introduced prodigality.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be owned that the parliament made &s;ome new efforts to check the progre&s;s of vice and immo|rality, which now began to be diffu&s;ed through every rank of life. But they were &s;upported neither by the co-operation of the mini&s;try, nor the voice of the people.</P>
<P>It was now two years &s;ince the king had vi&s;ited his electoral dominions of Hanover. He, therefore, &s;oon after the breaking up of the parlia|ment, prepared for a journey thither.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1727.</NOTE> Having appointed a regency in his ab|&s;ence, he embarked for Holland, and lay, upon his landing, at a little town called Voet. Next day he proceeded on his journey, and in two days more, between ten and eleven at night, arrived at Delden, to all appearance in perfect health. He &s;up|ped there very heartily, and continued his progre&s;s early the next morning, but between eight and nine ordered his coach to &s;top. It being perceived that one of his hands lay motionle&s;s, mon&s;ieur Fabrice, who had formerly been &s;ervant to the king of Swe|den, and who now attended king George, attempted to quicken the circulation, by chafing it between his own. As this had no effect, the &s;urgeon who fol|lowed on hor&s;eback, was called, and he al&s;o rubbed it with &s;pirits. Soon after the king's tongue began to &s;well, and he had ju&s;t &s;trength enough to bid them
<PB N="308" REF="325">
ha&s;ten to O&s;naburgh. Then falling in&s;en&s;ible into Fabrice's arms, he never recovered, but expired about eleven o'clock the next morning, in the &s;ixty-eighth year of his age, and the thirteenth of his reign.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXV. GEORGE II.</HEAD>
<P>UPON the death of George the fir&s;t, his &s;on, George the Second, came to the crown; a man of inferior abilities to the late king, and &s;trong|ly bia&s;&s;ed with a partiality to his dominions on the continent. The chief per&s;on, and he who &s;hortly af|ter engro&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t &s;hare of power under him, was Sir Robert Walpole, who had ri&s;en from low be|ginnings, through two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive reigns into great con&s;ideration. He was con&s;idered as a martyr to his cau&s;e, in the reign of queen Anne; and when the Tory party could no longer oppre&s;s him, he &s;till pre&s;erved that hatred again&s;t them with which he &s;et out. To defend the declining prerogative of the crown, might perhaps have been the fir&s;t object of his attention; but &s;oon after tho&s;e very mea&s;ures by which he pretended to &s;ecure it, proved the mo&s;t ef|fectual means to le&s;&s;en it. By corrupting the hou&s;e of commons, he encrea&s;ed their riches and their pow|er; and they were not aver&s;e to voting away tho&s;e millions which he permitted them &s;o liberally to &s;hare. As &s;uch a tendency in him naturally produced oppo&s;i|tion, he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a mo&s;t phlegmatic in&s;en&s;i|bility to reproach, and a calm di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate manner of rea&s;oning upon &s;uch topics as he de&s;ired &s;hould be believed. His di&s;cour&s;e was fluent, but without dig|nity; and his manner convincing from its apparent want of art.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="326">The Spaniards were the fir&s;t nation who &s;hewed the futility of the treaties of the former reign to bind, when any advantage was to be procured by infraction. The people of our We&s;t-India i&s;lands, had long carried on an illicit trade with the &s;ubjects of Spain upon the continent, but whenever detected were rigorou&s;ly puni&s;hed and their cargoes confi&s;cated to the crown. In this temerity of adventure on the one hand, and vigi|lance of pur&s;uit and puni&s;hment on the other, it mu&s;t often have happened that the innocent mu&s;t &s;uffer with the guilty, and many complaints were made, perhaps founded in ju&s;tice, that the Engli&s;h merchants were plundered by the Spani&s;h king's ve&s;&s;els upon the &s;outh|ern coa&s;ts of America, as if they had been pirates.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h mini&s;try, unwilling to credit every report, which was enflamed by re&s;entment, or urged by avarice, expected to remedy the evils complained of by their favourite &s;y&s;tem of treaty, and in the mean time promi&s;ed the nation redre&s;s. At length, how|ever the complaints became more general, and the merchants remon&s;trated by petition, to the hou&s;e of commons, who entered into a deliberation on the &s;ub|ject. They examined the evidence of &s;everal who had been unju&s;tly &s;eized, and treated with great cru|elty. One man, the ma&s;ter of a trading ve&s;&s;el, had been u&s;ed by the Spaniards in the mo&s;t &s;hocking manner; he gave in his evidence with great preci&s;ion, informed the hou&s;e of the manner they had plundered and &s;tript him, of their cutting off his ears, and their preparing to put him to death. "I then looked up, cried he, to my God for pardon, and to my country for revenge."</P>
<P>The&s;e accounts rai&s;ed a flame among the people, which it was neither the mini&s;ter's intere&s;t, nor per|haps that of the nation to indulge; new negotiations were &s;et on foot, and new mediators offered their in|terpo&s;ition. A treaty was &s;igned at Vienna, between the emperor, the king of Great Britain, and the king
<PB N="310" REF="327">
of Spain, which &s;ettled the peace of Europe upon its former footing, and put off the threatening war for a time. By this treaty the king of England conceived hopes that all war would be at an end. Don Carlos, upon the death of the duke of Parma, was, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an Engli&s;h fleet, put in peaceable po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of Parma and Placentia, while &s;ix thou&s;and Spaniards were quietly admitted, and quartered in the duchy of Tu&s;cany, to &s;ecure for him the rever&s;ion of that dukedom.</P>
<P>An interval of peace &s;ucceeded, in which &s;carce any events happened that de&s;erve the remembrance of an hi&s;torian.</P>
<P>During this interval of profound peace, nothing remarkable happened, and &s;carce any conte&s;t en&s;ued except in the Briti&s;h parliament, where the di&s;putes between the court and country party were carried-on with uncea&s;ing animo&s;ity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1731.</NOTE>A &s;ociety of men in this intere&s;ted age of &s;eeming benevolence, had united them&s;elves into a company, by the name of the Charitable Corporation; and their profe&s;&s;ed intention was to lend money at legal intere&s;t to the poor, upon &s;mall pledges, and to per&s;ons of higher rank upon proper &s;ecurity. Their capital was at fir&s;t limited to thirty thou&s;and pounds, but they af|terwards increa&s;ed it to &s;ix hundred thou&s;and. This money was &s;upplied by &s;ub&s;cription, and the care of conducting the capital was intru&s;ted to a proper num|ber of directors. This company having continued for more than twenty years, the ca&s;hier, George Robin|&s;on, member for Marlow, and the warehou&s;e-keeper, John Thomp&s;on, di&s;appeared in one day. Five hun|dred thou&s;and pounds of capital was found to be &s;unk and embezzled by means which the proprietors could not di&s;cover. They therefore, in a petition, repre&s;ented to the hou&s;e the manner in which they had been de|frauded, and the di&s;tre&s;s to which many of the peti|tioners
<PB N="311" REF="328">
were reduced. A &s;ecret committee being ap|pointed to examine into this grievance, a mo&s;t iniqui|tous &s;cene of fraud was &s;oon di&s;covered which had been carried on by Robin&s;on and Thomp&s;on, in concert with &s;ome of the directors, for embezzling the capi|tal and cheating the proprietors. Many per&s;ons of rank and quality were concerned in this infamous con&s;piracy; and even &s;ome of the fir&s;t characters in the nation did not e&s;cape cen&s;ure. A &s;pirit of avarice and rapacity had infected every rank of life about this time; no le&s;s than &s;ix members of parliament were expelled for the mo&s;t fordid acts of knavery. Sir Robert Sutton, Sir Archibald Grant, and George Robin&s;on, for their frauds in the management of the Charitable Corporation &s;cheme; Dennis Bond, and &s;ergeant Burch, for a fraudulent &s;ale of the late un|fortunate earl of Derwentwater's large e&s;tate, and la&s;t|ly, John Ward, of Hackney, for forgery. Luxury had given birth to prodigality, and that was the pa|rent of the meane&s;t arts of peculation. It was a&s;&s;ert|ed in the hou&s;e of lords, at that time, that not one &s;hilling of the forfeited e&s;tates was ever applied to the &s;ervice of the public, but became the reward of frau|dulence and venality.</P>
<P>A &s;cheme &s;et on foot by Sir Robert Walpole &s;oon after engro&s;&s;ed the attention of the public,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1732.</NOTE> which was to &s;ix a ge|neral exci&s;e. The mini&s;ter introduced it into the hou&s;e, by going into a detail of the frauds practi&s;ed by the factors in London, who were employed by the American planters in &s;elling their tobacco. To pre|vent the&s;e frauds he propo&s;ed, that in&s;tead of having the cu&s;toms levied in the u&s;ual manner upon tobac|co, all herereafter to be imported &s;hould be lodged in warehou&s;es appointed for that purpo&s;e by the officers of the crown, and &s;hould from thence be &s;old, upon paying the duty of four-pence a pound, when the pro|prietor found a purcha&s;er. This propo&s;al rai&s;ed a violent
<PB N="312" REF="329">
ferment, not le&s;s within doors than without. It was a&s;&s;erted that it would expo&s;e the factors to &s;uch hard|&s;hips that they would be unable to continue their trade, and that &s;uch a &s;cheme would not even prevent the frauds complained of. It was added, that a num|ber of additional exci&s;emen and warehou&s;e-keepers would thus be employed, which would at once ren|der the mini&s;try formidable, and the people depen|dent. Such were the arguments made u&s;e of to &s;tir up the citizens to oppo&s;e this law; arguments rather &s;pecious than &s;olid, &s;ince, with all its di&s;advantages, the tax upon tobacco would thus be more &s;afely and expeditiou&s;ly collected, and the avenues to number|le&s;s frauds would be &s;hut up. The people, however, were rai&s;ed into &s;uch a ferment, that the parliament hou&s;e was &s;urrounded with multitudes, who intimi|dated the mini&s;try, and compelled them to drop the de&s;ign. The mi&s;carriage of the bill was celebrated with public rejoicings in London and We&s;tmin&s;ter, and the mini&s;ter was burned in effigy by the popu|lace of London.</P>
<P>Ever &s;ince the treaty of Utrecht, the Spaniards in America had in&s;ulted and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the commerce of Great Britain, and the Briti&s;h merchants had at|tempted to carry on an illicit trade into their domi|minions. A right which the Engli&s;h merchants claimed by treaty, of cutting log-wood in the bay of Campeachy, gave them frequent opportunities of pu&s;hing in contraband commodities upon the conti|nent; &s;o that to &s;uppre&s;s the evil, the Spaniards were re&s;olved to annihilate the claim. This liberty of cut|ting log-wood had often been acknowledged, but ne|ver clearly a&s;certained; in all former treaties, it was con&s;idered as an object of too little importance to make a &s;eparate article in any negociation. The Spani&s;h ve&s;&s;els appointed for protecting the coa&s;t con|tinued their &s;everities upon the Engli&s;h; many of the &s;ubjects of Britain were &s;ent to dig in the mines
<PB N="313" REF="330">
of Poto&s;i, and deprived of all means of conveying their complaints to tho&s;e who might &s;end them re|dre&s;s. One remon&s;trance followed another to the court of madrid of this violation of treaty; but the only an&s;wer given were promi&s;es of enquiry, which produced no reformation. Our merchants complain|ed loudly of tho&s;e outrages; but the mini&s;ter vainly expected from negociations that redre&s;s, which was only to be obtained by arms.</P>
<P>The fears di&s;covered by the court of Great Britain only &s;erved to encrea&s;e the in&s;olence of the enemy; and their guard &s;hips continued to &s;eize not only all the guilty, but the innocent, whom they found &s;ail|ing along the Spani&s;h main. At la&s;t, however, the complaints of the Engli&s;h merchants were loud e|nough to intere&s;t the hou&s;e of commons; their let|ters and memorials were produced, and their griev|ances enforced by council at the bar of the hou&s;e. It was &s;oon found that the money which Spain had a|greed to pay to the court of Great Britain was with|held, and no rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for the delay. The mi|ni&s;ter, therefore, to gratify the general ardour, and to atone for his former deficiencies, a&s;&s;ured the hou&s;e that he would put the nation into a condition for war. Soon after letters of repri&s;al were granted again&s;t the Spaniards, and this being on both &s;ides con&s;idered as an actual commencement of ho&s;tilities, both dili|gently &s;et forward their armaments by &s;ea and land. In this threatening &s;ituation the French mini&s;ter at the Hague declared that his ma&s;ter was obliged by treaty to a&s;&s;i&s;t the king of Spain; &s;o that the alliances, which but twenty years before had taken place, were now quite rever&s;ed. At that time France and Eng|land were combined again&s;t Spain; at pre&s;ent, France and Spain were united again&s;t England; &s;uch little hopes can &s;tate&s;men place upon the firme&s;t trea|ties, where there is no &s;uperior power to compel the ob&s;ervance.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="331">A rupture between England and Spain being now become unavoidable, the people, who had long cla|moured for war, began to feel uncommon alacrity at its approach; and the mini&s;try, finding it inevitable, began to be as earne&s;t in preparation. Orders were i&s;|&s;ued for augmenting the land forces,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1739.</NOTE> and rai&s;ing a body of marines. War was declar|ed with all proper &s;olemnity, and &s;oon after two rich Spani&s;h prizes were taken in the Mediterranean. Admiral Vernon, a man of more courage than experience, of more confidence than &s;kill, was &s;ent commander of a fleet into the We&s;t Indies, to di&s;tre&s;s the enemy in that part of the globe. He had a&s;&s;erted in the hou&s;e of Commons that Porto Bello, a &s;ort and harbour in South America, could be ea&s;ily de&s;troyed, and that he him&s;elf would under|take to reduce it with &s;ix &s;hips only. A project which appeared &s;o wild and impo&s;&s;ible, was rediculed by the mini&s;try; but as he &s;till in&s;i&s;ted upon the pro|po&s;al, they complied with his reque&s;t, hoping that his want of &s;ucce&s;s might repre&s;s the confidence of his party. In this, however, they were di&s;appointed; for with &s;ix &s;hips only, he attacked and demoli&s;hed all the fortifications of the place, and came away vic|torious, with &s;carce the lo&s;s of a man. This victory was magnified at home in all the &s;trains of panegyric, and the triumph was far &s;uperior to the value of the conque&s;t.</P>
<P>While vigorous preparations were making in other departments, a &s;quadron of &s;hips was equipped for di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the enemy in the South Seas, the command of which was given to commodore An&s;on. This fleet was de&s;tined to &s;ail through the &s;treights of Ma|gellan, and &s;teering northwards along the coa&s;ts of Chili and Peru, to co-operate occa&s;ionally with ad|miral Vernon acro&s;s the i&s;thmus of Darien. The de|lays and mi&s;takes of the mini&s;try fru&s;trated that part of the &s;cheme, which was originally well laid. When
<PB N="315" REF="332">
it was too late in the &s;ea&s;on, the commodore &s;et out with five &s;hips of the line, a frigate, and two &s;tore|&s;hips, with about fourteen hundred men. Having reached the coa&s;ts of Brazil, he refre&s;hed his men for &s;ome time on the i&s;land of St Catharine, a &s;pot that enjoys all the fruitfulne&s;s and verdure of the luxurious tropical climate. From thence he &s;teered downward into the cold and tempe&s;tuous regions of the &s;outh; and in about five months after, meeting a terrible tempe&s;t, he doubled Cape Horn. By this time his fleet was di&s;per&s;ed, and his crew deplorably di&s;abled with the &s;curvy; &s;o that with much difficulty he gained the delightful i&s;land of Juan Fernandez. There he was joined by one &s;hip, and a frigate of &s;e|ven guns. From thence advancing northward, he landed on the coa&s;t of Chili, and attacked the city of of Paita by night. In this bold attempt he made no u&s;e of his &s;hipping, nor even di&s;embarked all his men; a few &s;oldiers, favoured by darkne&s;s, &s;ufficed to fill the whole town with terror and confu&s;ion. The governor of the garri&s;on, and the inhabitants fled on all &s;ides; accu&s;tomed to be &s;evere, they expected &s;e|verity. In the mean time, a &s;mall body of the Eng|li&s;h kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town for three days, &s;trip|ping it of all its trea&s;ures and merchandi&s;e to a con&s;i|derable amount, and then &s;etting it on fire.</P>
<P>Soon after this &s;mall &s;quadron advanced as far as Panama, &s;ituated on the i&s;thmus of Darien, on the we&s;|tern &s;ide of the great American continent. The com|modore now placed all his hopes in taking one of tho&s;e valuable Spani&s;h &s;hips, which trade from the Philippine I&s;lands to Mexico. Not above one or two at the mo&s;t of the&s;e immen&s;ely rich &s;hips went from one continent to the other in a year; they were therefore very large, in order to carry a &s;ufficiency of trea&s;ure, and proportiona|bly &s;trong to defend it. In hopes of meeting with one of the&s;e, the commocore, with his little fleet, traver&s;ed the great Pacific Ocean; but the &s;curvyonce more vi&s;iting
<PB N="316" REF="333">
his crew, &s;everal of his men died, and almo&s;t all were di&s;abled. In this exigence having brought all his men into one ve&s;&s;el, and &s;et fire to the other, he &s;teered for the i&s;land of Tinian, which lies about half way between the new world and the old. In this charm|ing abode he continued for &s;ome time, till his men recovered their health, and his &s;hip was refitted for &s;ailing.</P>
<P>Thus refre&s;hed he &s;et forward for China, where he laid in proper &s;tores for once more traver&s;ing back that immen&s;e ocean in which he had ju&s;t before &s;uf|fered &s;uch incredible difficulties. Having according|ly taken &s;ome Dutch and Indian &s;ailors on board, he again &s;teered towards America, and at length after various toils, di&s;covered the Spani&s;h galleon he had &s;o long ardently expected. This ve&s;&s;el was built as well for the purpo&s;es of war as of merchandi&s;e. It mounted &s;ixty guns, and five hundred men, while the crew of the commodore did not amount to half that number. However the victory was on the &s;ide of the Engli&s;h, and they returned home with their valuable prize, which was e&s;timated at three hundred and thirteen thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, while the dif|ferent captures that had been made before amounted to as much more. Thus after a voyage of three years, conducted with a&s;toni&s;hing per&s;everance and intrepidi|ty, the public &s;u&s;tained the lo&s;s of a noble fleet; but a few individuals became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of immen&s;e riches.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Engli&s;h conducted other operations again&s;t the enemy with amazing activity. When An&s;on &s;et out it was with a de&s;ign of acting a &s;ubordinate part to a formidable armament de&s;igned for the coa&s;ts of New Spain, con&s;i&s;ting of twenty-nine &s;hips of the line, and almo&s;t an equal number of fri|gates, furni&s;hed with all kinds of warlike &s;tores, near fifteen thou&s;and &s;eamen, and as many land-forces. Never was a fleet more completely equipped, nor never had the nation more &s;anguine hopes of &s;ucce&s;s.
<PB N="317" REF="334">
Lord Carthcart was appointed to command the land-forces; but he dying on the pa&s;&s;age, the command devolved upon general Wentworth, who&s;e abilities were &s;uppo&s;ed to be unequal to the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him.</P>
<P>When the forces were landed at Carthagena, they erected a battery, with which they made a breach in the principal fort, while Vernon, who commanded the fleet, &s;ent a number of &s;hips into the harbour, to di|vide the fire of the enemy, and to co-operate with the army on &s;hore. The breach being deemed practica|ble, a body of troops were commanded to &s;torm; but the Spaniards de&s;erted the forts, which, if po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of courage, they might have defended with &s;ucce&s;s. The troops, upon gaining this advantage, were ad|vanced a good deal nearer the city; but they there met a much greater oppo&s;ition than they had expect|ed. It was found, or a&s;&s;erted, that the fleet could not lie near enough to batter the town, and that no|thing remained but to attempt one of the forts by &s;ealing. The leaders of the fleet and the army be|gan mutually to accu&s;e each other, each a&s;&s;erting the probability of what the other denied. At length, Wentworth&punc; &s;timulated by the admiral's re|proach, re&s;olved to try the dangerous experiment, and ordered that fort St. Lazare &s;hould be attempted by &s;calade. Nothing could be more unfortunate than this undertaking; the forces marching up to the at|tack, their guides were &s;lain, and they mi&s;took their way. In&s;tead of attempting the weake&s;t part of the fort, they advanced to where it was &s;tronge&s;t, and where they were expo&s;ed to the fire of the town. Colonel Grant, who commanded the grenadiers, was killed in the beginning. Soon after it was found that their &s;caling ladders were too &s;hort; the officers were perplexed for want of orders, and the troops &s;tood ex|po&s;ed to the whole fire of the enemy, without know|ing how to proceed. After bearing a dreadful fire for
<PB N="318" REF="335">
&s;ome hours with great intrepidity, they at length re|treated, leaving &s;ix hundred men dead on the &s;pot. The terrors of the climate &s;oon began to be more dreadful than tho&s;e of war; the rainy &s;ea&s;on came on with &s;uch violence, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for the troops to con|tinue encamped; and the mortality of the &s;ea&s;on now began to attack them in all its frightful varieties. To the&s;e calamities, &s;ufficient to quell any enterprize, was added the di&s;&s;ention between the land and &s;ea commanders, who blamed each other for every fai|lure, and became frantic with mutual recrimination. They only, therefore, at la&s;t could be brought to a|gree in one mortifying mea&s;ure, which was to reim|bark the troops, and to withdraw them as quick as po&s;&s;ible from this &s;cence of &s;laughter and conta|gion.</P>
<P>This fatal mi&s;carriage which tarni&s;hed the Briti&s;h glory, was no &s;ooner known in England, than the kingdom was filled with murmers and di&s;content. The loude&s;t bur&s;t of indignation was directed at the mini&s;ter; and they who once prai&s;ed him for &s;ucce&s;&s;es he did not merit, condemned him now for a failure, of which he was guiltle&s;s.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1741.</NOTE>The mini&s;ter finding the indignation of the hou&s;e of commons turned again&s;t him, tried every art to break that confederacy, which he knew he had not &s;trength to oppo&s;e. The re&s;entment of the people had been rai&s;ed again&s;t him to an extravagant height; and their leaders taught them to expect very &s;ignal ju&s;tice on their &s;up|po&s;ed oppre&s;&s;or. At length finding his po&s;t untena|ble, he declared he would never &s;it more in that hou&s;e: the next day the king adjourned both hou&s;es of parliament for a few days, and in the interim Sir Robert Walpole, was created earl of Orford, and re|&s;igned all his employments.</P>
<P>But the plea&s;ure of his defeat was of &s;hort dura|tion; it &s;oon appeared that tho&s;e who declaimed mo&s;t
<PB N="319" REF="336">
loudly for the liberties of the people had adopted new mea&s;ures with their new employments. The new converts were branded as betrayers of the intere&s;ts of their country; but particularly the re&s;entment of the people fell upon Pulteney earl of Bath, who had long declaimed again&s;t that very conduct he now &s;eemed earne&s;t to pur&s;ue. He had been the idol of the people, and con&s;idered as one of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious cham|pions that had ever defended the cau&s;e of freedom; but allured perhaps with the hope of governing in Walpole's place, he was contented to give up his po|pularity for ambition. The king, however, treated him with that neglect which he merited: he was laid a&s;ide for life, and continued a wretched &s;urvivor of all his former importance.</P>
<P>The emperor dying in the year 1740, the French began to think this a favourable opportunity for ex|erting their ambition once more. Regardle&s;s of trea|ties, particularly that called the pragmatic &s;anction, by which the rever&s;ion of all the late emperor's do|minions was &s;ettled upon his daughter, they cau&s;ed the elector of Bavaria to be crowned emperor. Thus the queen of Hungary, daughter of Charles the Sixth, de&s;cened from an illu&s;trious line of emperors, &s;aw her|&s;elf &s;tripped of her inheritance, and left for a whole year de&s;erted by all Europe, and without any hopes of &s;uccour. She had &s;carce clo&s;ed her father's eyes, when &s;he lo&s;t Sile&s;ia, by an irruption of the young king of Pru&s;&s;ia, who &s;eized the opportunity of her defence|le&s;s &s;tate to renew his ancient pretentions to that pro|vince, of which it mu&s;t be owned his ance&s;tors had been unju&s;tly deprived. France, Saxony, and Bava|ria, attacked the re&s;t of her dominions; England was the only ally that &s;eemed willing to e&s;pou&s;e her help|le&s;s condition. Sardinia, and Holland, &s;oon after came to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and la&s;t of all Ru&s;&s;ia acceded to the union in her favour.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="337">It may now be demanded, what cau&s;e Britain had to intermeddle in the&s;e continental &s;chemes. It can only be an&s;wered, that the intere&s;ts of Hanover, and the &s;ecurity of that electorate, depended upon the nicely balancing the different intere&s;ts of the empire; and the Engli&s;h mini&s;try were willing to gratify the king.</P>
<P>Accordingly the king &s;ent a body of Engli&s;h forces into the Netherlands, which he had augmented by &s;ixteen thou&s;and Hanoverians, to make a diver&s;ion upon the dominions of France, in the queen of Hun|gary's favour. And by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the&s;e the queen of Hungary &s;oon began to turn the &s;cale of victory on her &s;ide. The French were driven out of Bohemia. Her general, prince Charles, at the head of a large army, invaded the dominions of Bavaria. Her rival, the nominal emperor, was obliged to fly before her; and being abandoned by his allies, and &s;tripped of even his hereditary dominions, retired to Franckfort, where he lived in ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>The French, in order to prevent this junction of the Au&s;trian and Briti&s;h forces, a&s;&s;embled an army of &s;ix|ty thou&s;and men upon the river Mayne, under the command of mar&s;hal Noailles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1743.</NOTE> who po&s;ted his troops upon the ea&s;t &s;ide of that river. The Briti&s;h forces, to the number of forty thou&s;and, pu&s;hed forward on the other &s;ide into a country where they found them&s;elves entirely de&s;titute of provi&s;ions, the French having cut off all means of their being &s;upplied. The king of Eng|land arrived at the camp, while his army was in this deplorable &s;ituation, wherefore he re&s;olved to pene|trate forward to join twelve thou&s;and Hanoverians and He&s;&s;ians, who had reached Hannau. With this view he decamped; but before his army had marched three leagus, he found the enemy had enclo&s;ed him on e|very &s;ide, near a village called Dettingen.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="338">Nothing now pre&s;ented but the mo&s;t mortifying pro&s;pects; if he fought the enemy, it mu&s;t be at the greate&s;t di&s;advantage; if he continued inactive, there was a certainty of being &s;tarved; and retreat for all was impo&s;&s;ible. The impetuo&s;ity of the French troops &s;aved his whole army. They pa&s;&s;ed a defile, which they &s;hould have been contended to guard; and, under the conduct of the duke of Gramont, their hor&s;e charged the Engli&s;h foot with great fury. They were received with intrepidity and re&s;olution; &s;o that they were obliged to give way, and repa&s;s the Mayne with precipitation, with the lo&s;s of about five thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>Mean while the French went on with vigour on every &s;ide. They projected an inva&s;ion of England; and Charles, the &s;on of the old Pretender, departed from Rome, in the di&s;gui&s;e of a Spani&s;h courier, for Paris, where he had an audience of the French king.</P>
<P>This family had long been the dupes of France; but it was thought at pre&s;ent there were &s;erious re&s;o|lutions formed in their favour. The troops de&s;tined for the expedition amounted to fifteen thou&s;and men, preparations were made for embarking them at Dun|kirk, and &s;ome of the neare&s;t ports to England, un|der the eye of the young Pretender. The duke de Roquefeuille, with twenty &s;hips of the line, was to &s;ee them &s;afely landed in England, and the famous count Saxe was to command them, when put on &s;hore. But the whole project was di&s;concerted by the appearance of Sir John Norris, who, with a &s;upe|rior fleet, made up to attack them. The French fleet was thus obliged to put back; a very hard gale of wind damaged their tran&s;ports beyond redre&s;s; and the French, now fru&s;trated in their &s;cheme of a &s;ud|den de&s;cent, thought &s;it openly to declare war.</P>
<P>The French, therefore, entered upon the war with great alacrity. They be&s;ieged Fribourg, and in the beginning of the &s;ucceeding campaign inve&s;ted the
<PB N="322" REF="339">
&s;trong city of Tournay. Although the allies were inferior in number, and although commanded by the duke of Cumberland, yet they re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;ave this city by hazarding a battle. They accord|ingly marched again&s;t the enemy, and took po&s;t in &s;ight of the French, who were encamped on an emi|nence, the village of St. Antoine on the right, a wood on the left, and the town of Fontenoy before them. This advantageous &s;ituation did not repre&s;s the ardour of the Engli&s;h, who began the attack at two o'clock in the morning, and pre&s;&s;ing forward bore down all oppo&s;ition. They were for near an hour victorious, and confident of &s;ucce&s;s, while Saxe, a &s;oldier of fortune, who commanded the French army, was at that time &s;ick of the &s;ame di&s;order of which he afterwards died. However he was carried about to all the po&s;ts in a litter, and a&s;&s;ured his attendants that, notwith&s;tanding all unfavourable appearances, the day was his own. A column of the Engli&s;h, without any command, but by mere mechanical courage, had advanced upon the enemies lines, which open|ing, formed an avenue on each &s;ide to receive them. It was then that the French artillery on the three &s;ides began to play on this forlorn body, which though they continued for a long time un&s;haken, were obliged at la&s;t to retreat about three in the afternoon. This was one of the mo&s;t bloody battles that had been fought in this age; the allies left on the field of battle near twelve thou&s;and men, and the French bought their victory with near an equal number of &s;lain.</P>
<P>This blow, by which Tournay was taken by the French, gave them &s;uch a manife&s;t &s;uperiority all the re&s;t of the campaign, that they kept the fruits of their victory during the whole continuance of the war.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1745.</NOTE>But tho' bad &s;ucce&s;s attended the Briti&s;h arms by land and &s;ea, yet the&s;e being di&s;|tant evils, the Engli&s;h &s;eemed only to com|plain from honourable motives, and mur|mured
<PB N="323" REF="340">
at di&s;tre&s;&s;es, of which they had but a very remote pro&s;pect. A civil war was now going to be kindled in their own dominions, which mixed ter|rors with their complaints; and which while it en|crea&s;ed their perplexities, only cemented their union.</P>
<P>It was at this period that the &s;on of the old Preten|der re&s;olved to make an effort for gaining the Briti&s;h crown. Charles Edward, the adventurer in que&s;tion, had been bred in a luxurious court, without partaking in its effeminacy. He was enterprizing and ambi|tious; but either from inexperience, or natural ina|bility, utterly unequal to the bold undertaking. He was long flattered by the ra&s;h, the &s;uper&s;titious, and the needy; he was taught to believe that the kingdom was ripe for a revolt, and that it could no longer bear the immen&s;e load of taxes with which it was bur|thened.</P>
<P>Being now, therefore, furni&s;hed with &s;ome money, and with &s;till larger promi&s;es from France, who fanned his ambition, he embarked for Scotland on board a &s;mall frigate, accompanied by the marquis of Tullibardine, Sir Thomas Sheridan, and a few other de&s;parate ad|venturers. Thus for the conque&s;t of the whole Bri|ti&s;h empire, he only brought with him &s;even officers, and arms for two thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>The boldne&s;s of this enterprize a&s;toni&s;hed all Eu|rope. It awakened the fears of the pu&s;ilanimous, the ardour of the brave, and the pity of the wi&s;e.</P>
<P>But by this time the young adventurer was arrived at Perth, where the unnece&s;&s;ary ceremony was per|formed of proclaiming his father king of Great Britain. From thence, de&s;cending with his forces from the mountains, they &s;eemed to gather as they went for|ward; and advancing to Edinburgh, they entered that city without oppo&s;ition. There again the page|anty of proclamation was performed; and there he promi&s;ed to di&s;&s;olve the union, which was con&s;ider|ed as one of the grievances of the country. Howe|ver,
<PB N="324" REF="341">
the ca&s;tle of that city &s;till held out, and he was unprovided with cannon to be&s;iege it.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Sir John Cope, who had pur|&s;ued the rebels through the Highlands, but had de|clined meeting them in their de&s;cent; being now re|inforced by two regiments of dragoons, re&s;olved to march towards Edinburgh, and give the enemy bat|tle. The young adventurer, who&s;e forces were ra|ther &s;uperior, though undi&s;ciplined, attacked him near Pre&s;ton Pans, about twelve miles from the capi|tal, and in a few minutes put him and his troops to flight. This victory, by which the king lo&s;t five hun|dred men, gave the rebels great influence; and had the Pretender taken advantage of the general con&s;ter|nation, and marched directly for England, the con|&s;equence might have been fatal to freedom. But he was amu&s;ed by the promi&s;e of &s;uccours which never came; and thus induced to remain in Edinburgh, to enjoy the triumphs of a trifling victory, and to be treated as a monarch.</P>
<P>While the young Pretender was thus trifling away his time at Edinburgh, for, in dangerous enterprizes, delay is but defeat, the mini&s;try of Great Britain took every proper precaution to oppo&s;e him with &s;ucce&s;s. Six thou&s;and Dutch troops, that had come over to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the crown, were di&s;patched north|ward, under the command of general Wade. The duke of Cumberland &s;oon after arrived from Flan|ders, and was followed by another detachment of dra|goons and infantry, well di&s;ciplined, and enured to action. Be&s;ides the&s;e, volunteers offered in every part of the kingdom; and every county exerted a vigorous &s;pirit of indignation both again&s;t the ambition, the religion, and the allies of the young Pretender.</P>
<P>However, he had been bred up in a &s;chool that taught him maxims very different from tho&s;e that then prevailed in England. Though he might have brought civil war and all the calamities attending it
<PB N="325" REF="342">
with him into the kingdom, he had been taught the a&s;&s;ertion of his right was a duty incumbent upon him, and the altering the con&s;titution and perhaps the re|ligion of his country, an object of laudable ambition. Thus animated he went forward with vigour, and hav|ing upon frequent con&s;ultations with his officers, come to a re&s;olution of making an irruption into Eng|land, he entered the country by the we&s;tern border, and inve&s;ted Carli&s;le, which &s;urrendered in le&s;s than three days. He there found a con&s;iderable quantity of arms, and there too he cau&s;ed his father to be pro|claimed king.</P>
<P>General Wade being apprized of his progre&s;s, ad|vanced acro&s;s the country from the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, but receiving intelligence that the enemy was two days march before him, he retired to his former &s;tation. The young Pretender, therefore, thus unoppo&s;ed, re&s;olved to penetrate farther into the kingdom, having received a&s;&s;urances from France that a con&s;iderable body of troops would be landed on the &s;outhern coa&s;ts, to make a diver&s;ion in his favour. He was flattered al&s;o with the hopes of being joined by a con&s;iderable number of malcontents, as he pa&s;&s;ed forward, and that his army would encrea&s;e on the march. Accord|ingly, leaving a &s;mall garri&s;on in Carli&s;le, which he &s;hould rather have left defencele&s;s, he advanced to Penrith, marching on foot in an Highland dre&s;s, and continuing his irruption till he came to Manche&s;ter, where he e&s;tabli&s;hed his head-quarters.</P>
<P>He was there joined by about two hundred Eng|li&s;h, who were formed into a regiment, under the command of colonel Townly. From thence he pur|&s;ued his march to Derby, intending to go by the way of Che&s;ter into Wales, where he hoped to be joined by a great number of followers; but the factions a|mong his own chiefs prevented his proceeding to that part of the kingdom.</P>
<P>He was by this time advanced within an hundred
<PB N="326" REF="343">
miles of the capital, which was filled with perplexity and con&s;ternation. Had he proceeded in his career with that expedition which he had hitherto u&s;ed, he might have made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the metropolis, where he would certainly have been joined by a con|&s;iderable number of his well-wi&s;hers, who waited im|patiently for his approach.</P>
<P>In the mean time the king re&s;olved to take the field in per&s;on. But he found &s;afety from the di&s;contents, which now began to prevail in the Pretender's army. In fact he was but the nominal leader of his forces; as his generals, the chiefs of the Highland clans, were, from their education, ignorant, and aver&s;e to &s;ubor|dination. They had from the beginning begun to embrace oppo&s;ite &s;y&s;tems of operation and to contend with each other for pre-eminence; but they &s;eemed now unanimous in returning to their own country once more.</P>
<P>The rebels accordingly effected their retreat to Car|li&s;le without any lo&s;s, and from thence cro&s;&s;ed the rivers Eden and Solway into Scotland. In the&s;e marches, however, they pre&s;erved all the rules of war; they ab&s;tained in a great mea&s;ure from plunder, they levied contributions on the towns as they pa&s;&s;ed along, and with unaccountable precaution left a garri|&s;on in Carli&s;le, which &s;hortly after was obliged to &s;ur|render to the duke of Cumberland at di&s;cretion, to the number of four hundred men.</P>
<P>The Pretender being returned to Scotland, he proceeded to Gla&s;gow, from which city he exacted &s;e|vere contributions. He advanced from thence to Stirling, where he was joined by lord Lewis Gordon, at the head of &s;ome forces, which had been a&s;&s;embled in his ab&s;ence. Other clans, to the number of two thou&s;and, came in likewi&s;e; and from &s;ome &s;upplies of money, which he received from Spain, and from &s;ome &s;kirmi&s;hes, in which he was &s;ucce&s;sful again&s;t the royali&s;ts, his affairs began to wear a more pro|mi&s;ing
<PB N="327" REF="344">
a&s;pect. Being joined by lord Drummond, he inve&s;ted the ca&s;tle of Stirling, commanded by general Blakeney; but the rebel forces being unu&s;ed to &s;ieges, con&s;umed much time to no purpo&s;e. It was during this attempt, that general Hawley, who commanded a con&s;iderable body of forces near Edinburgh, under|took to rai&s;e the &s;iege, and advanced towards the re|bel army as far as Falkirk. After two days &s;pent in mutually examining each other's &s;trength, the rebels being ardent to engage, were led on in full &s;pirits to attack the king's army. The Pretender, who was in the front line, gave the &s;ignal to engage; and the fir&s;t fire put Hawley's forces into confu&s;ion. The hor&s;e retreated with precipitation, and fell upon their own infantry; while the rebels following their blow, the greate&s;t part of the royal army fled with the utmo&s;t precipitation. They retired in confu&s;ion to Edin|burgh, leaving the conquerors in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their tents, their artillery, and the field of battle.</P>
<P>Thus far the affairs of the rebel army &s;eemed not un|pro&s;perous; but here was an end of all their triumphs. The duke of Cumberland, at that time the favourite of the Engli&s;h army, had been recalled from Flan|ders; and put him&s;elf at the head of the troops at Edin|burgh, which con&s;i&s;ted of about fourteen thou&s;and men. With the&s;e he advanced to Aberdeen, where he was joined by &s;everal of the Scotch nobility, at|tached to the hou&s;e of Hanover; and having revived the drooping &s;pirits of his army, he re&s;olved to find out the enemy, who retreated at his approach. After having refre&s;hed his troops at Aberdeen for &s;ome time, he renewed his march, and in twelve days he came upon the banks of the deep and rapid river Spey. This was the place where the rebels might have di&s;puted his pa&s;&s;age, but they lo&s;t every advantage in di&s;puting with each other. They &s;eemed now totally devoid of all coun&s;el and &s;ubordination, without conduct, and with|out unanimity. After a variety of conte&s;ts among
<PB N="328" REF="345">
each other, they re&s;olved to await their pur&s;uers upon the plains of Culloden, a place about nine miles di&s;|tant from Inverne&s;s, embo&s;omed in hills, except on that &s;ide which was open to the &s;ea. There they drew up in order of battle, to the number of eight thou&s;and men, in three divi&s;ions, &s;upplied with &s;ome pieces of artillery, ill manned and &s;erved.</P>
<P>The battle began about one o'clock in the after|noon; the cannon of the king's army did dreadful ex|ecution among the rebels, while theirs was totally un|&s;erviceable. One of the great errors in all the Pre|tender's warlike mea&s;ures, was his &s;ubjecting wild and undi&s;ciplined troops to the forms of artful war, and thus repre&s;&s;ing their native ardour, from which alone he could hope for &s;ucce&s;s. After they had been kept in their ranks, and with&s;tood the Engli&s;h fire for &s;ome time, they at length became impatient for clo&s;er engagement; and about five hundred of them made an irruption upon the left wing of the ene|my with their accu&s;tomed ferocity. The fir&s;t line being di&s;ordered by this on&s;et, two battalions ad|vanced to &s;upport it, and galled the enemy with a terrible and clo&s;e di&s;charge. At the &s;ame time the dragoons, under Hawley, and the Argyle&s;hire mili|tia pulling down a park wall that guarded the flank of the enemy, and which they had but feebly defended, fell in among them, &s;word in hand with great &s;laugh|ter. In le&s;s than thirty minutes they were totally routed, and the field covered with their wounded and &s;lain, to the number of above three thou&s;and men. The French troops on the left did not fire a &s;hot, but &s;tood inactive during the engagement, and afterwards &s;ur|rendered them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war. An entire bo|dy of the clans marched off the field, in order, while the re&s;t were routed with great &s;laughter, and their leaders obliged with reluctance to retire. Civil war is in it&s;elf terrible, but more &s;o when heightened by unnece&s;&s;ary cruelty. How guilty &s;oever an enemy
<PB N="329" REF="346">
may be, it is the duty of a brave &s;oldier to remember that he is only to fight an oppo&s;er, and not a &s;uppli|ant. The victory was in every re&s;pect deci&s;ive, and humanity to the conquered would have rendered it glorious. But little mercy was &s;hewn here; the con|querors were &s;een to refu&s;e quarter to the wounded, the unarmed, and the defencele&s;s; &s;ome were &s;lain who were only excited by curio&s;ity to become &s;pecta|tors of the combat, and &s;oldiers were &s;een to antici|pate the ba&s;e employment of the executioner. The duke immediately after the action, ordered &s;ix and thirty de&s;erters to be executed, the conquerors &s;pread terror wherever they came, and after a &s;hort &s;pace, the whole country round was one dreadful &s;cene of plunder, &s;laughter, and de&s;olation; ju&s;tice was for|gotten, and vengeance a&s;&s;umed the name.</P>
<P>In this manner were bla&s;ted all the hopes, and all the ambition of the young adventurer; one &s;hort hour deprived him of imaginary thrones and &s;ceptres, and reduced him from a nominal king, to a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed forlorn outca&s;t, &s;hunned by all mankind, except &s;uch as &s;ought his de&s;truction. To the good and the brave, &s;ub&s;equent di&s;tre&s;s often atones for former guilt; and while rea&s;on would &s;peak for puni&s;hment, our hearts plead for mercy. Immediately after the engagement, he fled away with a captain of Fitzjames's cavalry, and when their hor&s;es were fatigued they both alighted, and &s;eparately &s;ought for &s;afety. He for &s;ome days wandered in this country, naturally wild, but now rendered more formidable by war, a wretched &s;pec|tator of all tho&s;e horrors which were the re&s;ult of his ill-guided ambition.</P>
<P>There is a &s;triking &s;imilitude between his adven|tures, and tho&s;e of Charles the Second, upon his e&s;|cape from Worce&s;ter. He &s;ometimes found refuge in caves and cottages, without attendants, and de|pendent on the wretched natives, who could pity, but not relieve him. Sometimes he lay in fore&s;ts, with
<PB N="330" REF="347">
one or two companions of his di&s;tre&s;s, continually pur&s;ued by the troops of the conqueror, as there was a reward of thirty thou&s;and pounds offered for taking him, dead or a live. Sheridian, an Iri&s;h adventurer, was the per&s;on who kept mo&s;t faithfully by him, and in&s;pired him with courage to &s;upport &s;uch incre|dible hard&s;hips. He had occa&s;ion in the cour&s;e of his concealments, to tru&s;t his life to the fidelity of above fifty individuals, who&s;e veneration for his family pre|vailed above their avarice.</P>
<P>One day, having walked from morning till night, he ventured to enter a hou&s;e, the owner of which he well knew was attached to the oppo&s;ite party. As he entered, he addre&s;&s;ed the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e in the following manner.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The &s;on of your king comes to beg a little bread and a few cloaths. I know your pre&s;ent attachment to my adver&s;aries, but I believe you have &s;ufficient honour not to abu&s;e my confi|dence, or to take advantage of my di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation. Take the&s;e raggs that have for &s;ome time been my only covering; you may probably re&s;tore them to me one day when I &s;hall be &s;eated on the throne of Great Britain."</Q>
The ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e was touched with pity at his di&s;tre&s;s; he a&s;&s;i&s;ted him as far as he was a|ble, and never divulged the &s;ecret. There are few of tho&s;e who even wi&s;hed his de&s;truction, would chu&s;e to be the immediate actors in it, as it would &s;ubject them to the re&s;entment of a numerous party.</P>
<P>In this manner he continued to wander among the frightful wilds of Glengary, for near &s;ix months, of|ten hemmed round by his pur&s;uers, but &s;till re&s;cued by &s;ome lucky accident from the impending danger. At length a privateer of St Maloes, hired by his ad|herents, arrived in Lochnanach, in which he embarked in the mo&s;t wretched attire. He was clad in a &s;hort coat of black frize, thread bare, over which was a common Highland plaid, girt round by a belt, from whence depended a pi&s;tol and a dagger. He had not
<PB N="331" REF="348">
been &s;hifted for many weeks; his eye was hollow, his vi&s;age wan, and his con&s;titution greatly impaired by famine and fatigue. He was accompanied by Sulli|van and Sheridan, two Iri&s;h adherents, who had &s;hared all his calamities, together with Cameron of Lochiel, and his brother, and a few other exiles. They &s;et &s;ail for France, and after having been chaced by two Engli&s;h men of war, they arrived in &s;afety at a place called Ro&s;eau, near Morlaix in Bretagne. Perhaps he would have found it more difficult to e&s;|cape, had not the vigilance of his pur&s;uers been re|laxed by a report that he was already &s;lain.</P>
<P>In the mean time, while the Pretender was thus pur&s;ued, the &s;caffolds and the gibbets were preparing for his adherents. Seventeen officers of the rebel ar|my were hanged, drawn, and quartered at Kenning|ton-common, in the neighbourhood of London. Their con&s;tancy in death gained more pro&s;elytes to their cau&s;e than even perhaps their victories would have obtained. Nine were executed in the &s;ame manner at Carli&s;le, and eleven at York. A few ob|tained pardons, and a con&s;iderable number of the common men were tran&s;ported to the plantations in North America.</P>
<P>The earls of Kilmarnock and Cromartie, and the lord Balmerino, were tried by their peers, and found guilty. Cromartie was pardoned, and the others were beheaded on Tower-hill.</P>
<P>In this manner victory, defeat, negociation, trea|chery, and rebellion, &s;ucceeded each other rapidly for &s;ome years, till all &s;ides began to think them&s;elves growing more feeble, and gaining no &s;olid advan|tage</P>
<P>A negociation was therefore re&s;olved upon; and the contending powers agreed to come to a congre&s;s at Aix-la-Chapelle, where the earl of Sandwich and Sir Thomas Robin&s;on a&s;&s;i&s;ted as plenipotentiaries from the king of Great Britain. This treaty was begun,
<PB N="332" REF="349">
upon the preliminary conditions of re&s;toring all con|que&s;ts made during the war. From thence great hopes were expected of conditions both favourable and honourable to the Engli&s;h; but the treaty &s;till re|mains a la&s;ting mark of precipitate coun&s;els, and Eng|li&s;h di&s;grace. By this it was agreed, that all pri&s;oners on each &s;ide &s;hould be mutually re&s;tored, and all con|que&s;ts given up. That the dutchies of Parma, Placen|tia, and Gua&s;talla, &s;hould be ceded to Don Philip, heir apparent to the Spani&s;h throne, and to his heirs; but in ca&s;e of his &s;ucceeding to the crown of Spain, then the&s;e dominions &s;hould revert to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. It was confirmed that the fortifications of Dunkirk to the &s;ea &s;hould be demoli&s;hed; that the Engli&s;h &s;hip annually &s;ent with &s;laves to the coa&s;t of New Spain &s;hould have this privilege continued for four years. That the king of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;hould be con|firmed in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sile&s;ia, which he had late|ly conquered; and that the queen of Hungary &s;hould be &s;ecured in her patrimonial dominions. But one article of the peace was more di&s;plea&s;ing and afflic|tive to the Engli&s;h than all the re&s;t. It was &s;tipulated that the king of Great Britain &s;hould immediately, after the ratification of this treaty, &s;end two per&s;ons of rank and di&s;tinction to France as ho&s;tages, until re&s;titution &s;hould be made of Cape Breton, and all other conque&s;ts which England had made during the war. This was a mortifying clau&s;e; but to add to the general error of the negociation, no mention was made of the &s;earching the ve&s;&s;els of England in the A|merican &s;eas, upon which the war was originally be|gun. The limits of their re&s;pective po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in North-America were not a&s;certained; nor did they receive any equivalent for tho&s;e forts which they re|&s;tored to the enemy. The treaty of Utrecht had long been the object of reproach to tho&s;e by whom it was made; but with all its faults, the treaty now conclud|ed was by far more de&s;picable and erroneous. Yet
<PB N="333" REF="350">
&s;uch was the &s;pirit of the times, that the treaty of Utrecht was branded with univer&s;al contempt, and the treaty of Aix la-Chappelle was extolled with the high|e&s;t &s;trains of prai&s;e.</P>
<P>This treaty, which &s;ome a&s;&s;erted would &s;erve for a bond of permanent amity, was, properly &s;peaking, but a temporary truce; a ce&s;&s;ation from ho&s;tilities, which both &s;ides were unable to continue. Though the war between England and France was actually hu&s;hed up in Europe, yet in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies it &s;till went forward with dimini&s;hed vehemence. Both &s;ides &s;till willing to offend, &s;till offending, and yet both complaining of the infraction.</P>
<P>A new colony having been formed in North Ame|rica, in the Province of Nova-Scotia, it was thought that thither the wa&s;te of an exuberant nation might well be drained off; and tho&s;e bold &s;pirits kept in em|ployment at a di&s;tance, who might be dangerous, if &s;uffered to continue in idlene&s;s at home. Nova Sco|tia was a place where men might be impri&s;oned, but not maintained; it was cold, barren, and incapable of &s;ucce&s;sful cultivation. The new colony there|fore was maintained there with &s;ome expence to the government in the beginning; and &s;uch as were per|mitted, &s;oon went &s;outhward to the milder climates, where they were invited by an untenanted and fertile &s;oil. Thus did the nation ungratefully &s;end off her hardy veterans to peri&s;h on inho&s;pitable &s;hores, and this they were taught to believe would extend their dominion.</P>
<P>However it was for this barren &s;pot that the Engli&s;h and French revived the war, which &s;oon after &s;pread with &s;uch terrible deva&s;tation over every part of the globe. The native Indians bordering upon the de|&s;arts of Nova-Scotia, a fierce and &s;avage people, look|ed from the fir&s;t with jealou&s;y upon the&s;e new &s;ettlers; and they con&s;idered the vicinity of the Engli&s;h as an encroachment upon their native po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. The French, who were neighbours in like manner, and
<PB N="334" REF="351">
who were &s;till impre&s;&s;ed with national animo&s;ity, fo|mented the&s;e &s;u&s;picions in the natives, and repre&s;ent|ed the Engli&s;h (and with regard to this colony the re|pre&s;entation might be true) as enterprizing and &s;e|vere. Commi&s;&s;aries were, therefore, appointed to meet at Paris, to compromi&s;e the&s;e di&s;putes; but the&s;e conferences were rendered abortive by the cavilings of men, who could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to under&s;tand the &s;ubject in debate.</P>
<P>As this &s;eemed to be the fir&s;t place where the di&s;&s;en|&s;ions took their ri&s;e for a new war, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to be a little more minute. The French had been the fir&s;t cultivators of Nova Scotia, and by great indu&s;try and long per&s;everance, had rendered the &s;oil, natur|ally barren, &s;omewhat more fertile, and capable of &s;u&s;taining nature, with &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Europe. This country, however, had frequently changed ma&s;ters, until at length the Engli&s;h were &s;ettled in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and acknowledged as the rightful owners, by the treaty of Utretcht. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this country was reckoned nece&s;&s;ary to defend the Engli&s;h colonies to the north, and to pre&s;erve their &s;uperiority in the fi&s;heries in that part of the world The French, however, who had been long &s;ettled in the back parts of the country, re&s;olved to u&s;e every method to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s the new-comers, and &s;pirited up the Indians to more open ho&s;tilities, which were re|pre&s;ented to the Engli&s;h mini&s;try for &s;ome time with|out redre&s;s.</P>
<P>Soon after this another &s;ource of di&s;pute began to be &s;een in the &s;ame part of the world, and promi&s;ed as much unea&s;ine&s;s as the former. The French pretend|ing fir&s;t to have di&s;covered the mouth of the river Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, claimed the whole adjacent country to|wards New Mexico on the Ea&s;t, and quite to the Apa|lachian mountains on the We&s;t. In order to a&s;&s;ert their claims, as they found &s;everal Engli&s;h, who had &s;ettled beyond the&s;e mountains, from motives of com|merce,
<PB N="335" REF="352">
and al&s;o invited by the natural beauties of the country, they di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them of their new &s;ettle|ments, and built &s;uch forts as would command the whole country round about.</P>
<P>Not in America alone, but al&s;o in A&s;ia, the &s;eeds of a new war were preparing to be expanded. On the coa&s;ts of Malabar, the Engli&s;h and French had, in fact, never cea&s;ed from ho&s;tilities.</P>
<P>The mini&s;try, however, in England began now a very vigorous exertion in defence of their colonies, who refu&s;ed to defend them&s;elves. Four operations were undertaken in America at the &s;ame time. Of the&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1756.</NOTE> one was commanded by colonel Monckton, who had orders to drive the French from the encroachments upon the province of Nova Scotia. The &s;econd, more to the South, was directed again&s;t Crown-point, under the command of general John&s;on. The third, under the conduct of general Shirley, was de&s;tined to Nia|gara, to &s;ecure the forts on the river; and the fourth was farther &s;outhward &s;till, again&s;t Fort Du Que&s;ne, under general Braddock.</P>
<P>In the&s;e expeditions Monckton was &s;ucce&s;sful; John&s;on al&s;o was victorious, though he failed in tak|ing the fort again&s;t which he was &s;ent; Shirley was thought to have lo&s;t the &s;ea&s;on for operation by delay; Braddock was vigorous and active, but &s;uffered a de|feat. This bold commander, who had been recom|mended to this &s;ervice by the duke of Cumberland, &s;et forward upon his expedition in June, and left the cultivated parts of the country on the tenth at the head of two thou&s;and two hundred men, directing his march to that part of the country where general Wa&s;hing|ton had been defeated the year before. Being at length within ten miles of the French fortre&s;s, he was appointed to be&s;iege, and marching forward thro' the fore&s;ts with full confidence of &s;ucce&s;s, on a &s;ud|den his whole army was a&s;toni&s;hed by a general di&s;|charge
<PB N="336" REF="353">
of arms, both in front and flank, from an ene|my that &s;till remained un&s;een. It was now too late to think of retreating, the troops had pa&s;&s;ed into the defile, which the enemy had artfully permitted them to do before they offered to fire. The vanguard of the Engli&s;h now, therefore, fell back in con&s;ternation upon the main body, and the panic &s;oon became general. The officers alone dii&s;ganed to fly, while Braddock him|&s;elf &s;till continued to command his brave a&s;&s;ociates, di&s;|covering at once the greate&s;t intrepidity and the great|e&s;t imprudence. An enthu&s;ia&s;t to the di&s;cipline of war, he di&s;dained to fly from the field, or to permit his men to quit their ranks, when their only method of treating the Indian army, was by a precipitate at|tack, or an immediate de&s;ertion of the field of battle. At length Braddock, having received a mu&s;quet &s;hot, through the lungs, he dropped, and a total confu&s;ion en&s;ued. All the artillery, ammunition, and baggage of the army were left to the enemy; and the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by the Engli&s;h army might amount to &s;even hundred men.</P>
<P>The murmurs, fears, and di&s;&s;en&s;ions which this de|feat gave ri&s;e to, gave the French an opportunity of carrying on their de&s;igns on another quarter. The i&s;land of Minorca, which we had taken from the Spa|niards in the reign of queen Anne, was &s;ecured to England by repeated treaties. But the mini&s;try, at this time being blinded by dome&s;tic terrors, had neg|lected to take &s;ufficient precautions for its defence, &s;o that the garri&s;on was weak, and no way fitted to &s;tand a vigorous &s;iege. The French, therefore land|ed near the fortification of St. Philip's, which was rec|koned one of the &s;tronge&s;t in Europe, and command|ed by general Blakeney, who was brave indeed, but rather &s;uperannuated. The &s;iege was carried on with great vigour, and for &s;ome time as ob&s;tinately defend|ed on the &s;ide of the Engli&s;h, but the place was at length obliged to capitulate.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="354">The mini&s;try being apprized of this unexpected attack, re&s;olved to rai&s;e the &s;iege if po&s;&s;ible, and &s;ent out admiral Byng, with ten &s;hips of war, with orders to relieve Minorca at any rate. Byng accordingly &s;ailed from Gibraltar, where he was refu&s;ed any a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of men from the governor of that garri&s;on, under a pretence that his own fortification was in danger. Upon his approaching the i&s;land, he &s;oon &s;aw the French banners di&s;played upon the &s;hore, and the Engli&s;h colours &s;till flying on the ca&s;tle of St. Philip. He had been ordered to throw a body of troops into the garri&s;on, but this he thought too hazardous an undertaking; nor did he even make an attempt. While he was thus deliberating between his fears and his duty, his attention was quickly called off by the appearance of a French fleet, that &s;eemed of nearly equal force to his own. Confounded by a variety of mea&s;ures, he &s;eemed re&s;olved to pur&s;ue none, and therefore gave orders to form the line of battle, and act upon the defen&s;ive. Byng had been long prai&s;ed for his &s;kill in naval tactics; and, perhaps, valuing mo&s;t tho&s;e talents for which he was mo&s;t prai&s;ed, he &s;acrificed all claims to courage to the applau&s;e for naval di&s;cipline. The French fleet advanced, a part of the Engli&s;h fleet engaged, the admiral &s;till kept aloof, and gave very plau&s;ible rea&s;ons for not com|ing into action. The French fleet, therefore, &s;lowly &s;ailed away, and no other opportunity ever offered of coming to a clo&s;er engagement.</P>
<P>Nothing could exceed the re&s;entment of the nation upon being informed of Byng's conduct. The mi|ni&s;try were not aver&s;e to throwing from them&s;elves the blame of tho&s;e mea&s;ures which were attended with &s;uch indifferent &s;ucce&s;s, and they &s;ecretly fanned the flame. The news, which &s;oon after arrived, of the &s;urrender of the garri&s;on to the French, drove the ge|neral ferment almo&s;t to frenzy. In the mean time
<PB N="338" REF="355">
Byng continued at Gibraltar, quite &s;atisfied with his own conduct, and little expecting the dreadful &s;torm that was gathering again&s;t him at home. Or|ders, however, were &s;oon &s;et out for putting him un|der an arre&s;t, and for carrying him to England. Up|on his arrival he was committed to clo&s;e cu&s;tody, in Greenwich ho&s;pital, and &s;ome arts u&s;ed to enflame the populace again&s;t him, who want no incentives to injure and condemn their &s;uperiors. Several addre&s;|&s;es were &s;ent up from different counties, demanding ju&s;tice on the delinquent, which the mini&s;try were willing to &s;econd. He was &s;oon after tried by a court-martial in the harbour of Port&s;mouth, where, after a trial which continued &s;everal days, his judges were agreed that he had not done his utmo&s;t during the engagement to de&s;troy the enemy, and therefore they adjudged him to &s;uffer death by the twelfth arti|cle of war. At the &s;ame time, however, they recom|mended him as an object of mercy, as they con&s;ider|ed his conduct rather as the effects of error, than of cowardice. By this &s;entence they expected to &s;ati&s;|fy at once the re&s;entment of the nation, and yet &s;creen them&s;elves from con&s;cious &s;everity. The govern|ment was re&s;olved upon &s;hewing him no mercy; the parliament was applied to in his favour; but they found no circum&s;tances in his conduct that could in|validate the former &s;entence. Being thus abandoned to his fate, he maintained to the la&s;t a degree of for|titude and &s;erenity, that no way betrayed any timi|dity or cowardice. On the day fixed for his execu|tion, which was on board a man of war in the har|bour of Port&s;mouth, he advanced from the cabbin, where he had been impri&s;oned, upon deck, the place appointed for him to &s;uffer. After delivering a pa|per, containing the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;ertions of his inno|cence, he came forward to the place where he was to kneel down, and for &s;ome time per&s;i&s;ted in not
<PB N="339" REF="356">
covering his face; but his friends repre&s;enting that his looks would po&s;&s;ibly intimidate the &s;oldiers who were to &s;hoot him, and prevent their taking proper aim, he had his eyes bound with an handkerchief; and then giving the &s;ignal for the &s;oldiers to fire, he was killed in&s;tantaneou&s;ly. There appears &s;ome &s;e|verity in Byng's puni&s;hment; but it certainly pro|duced &s;oon after very beneficial effects to the na|tion.</P>
<P>In the progre&s;s of the war the forces of the con|tending powers of Europe were now drawn out in the following manner. England oppo&s;ed France in America, A&s;ia, and on the ocean. France attacked Hanover on the continent of Europe. This country the king of Pru&s;&s;ia undertook to protect; while Eng|land promi&s;ed him troops and money to a&s;&s;i&s;t his ope|rations. Then again Au&s;tria had their aims on the dominions of Pru&s;&s;ia, and drew the elector of Sax|ony into the &s;ame de&s;igns. In the&s;e views &s;he was &s;econded by France and Sweden, and by Ru&s;&s;ia, who had hopes of acquiring a &s;ettlement in the we&s;t of Europe.</P>
<P>The Ea&s;t was the quarter on which &s;ucce&s;s fir&s;t began to dawn upon the Briti&s;h arms. The affairs of the Engli&s;h &s;eemed to gain the a&s;cendancy, by the conduct of Mr. Clive. This gentleman had at fir&s;t entered the company's &s;ervice in a civil capacity, but finding his talents more adapted for war, he gave up his clerk&s;hip, and joined among the troops as a vo|lunteer. His courage, which is all that &s;ubordinate officers can at fir&s;t &s;hew, &s;oon became remarkable; but his conduct, expedition, and military &s;kill &s;oon after became &s;o con&s;picuous as to rai&s;e him to the fir&s;t rank in the army.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t advantage that was obtained from his activity and courage was the clearing the province of Arcot. Soon after the French general was taken pri|&s;oner;
<PB N="340" REF="357">
and the nabob, whom the Engli&s;h &s;upported, was rein&s;tated in the government, of which he had formerly been deprived.</P>
<P>The prince of the greate&s;t power in that country declared war again&s;t the Engli&s;h from motives of per|&s;onal re&s;entment, and, levying a numerous army, laid &s;iege to Calcutta, one of the principal Briti&s;h forts in that part of the world; but which was not in a &s;tate of &s;trength to defend it&s;elf again&s;t the attack of even barbarians. The fort was taken, having been de&s;erted by the commander; and the garri&s;on, to the number of an hundred and forty-&s;ix per&s;ons, were made pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>They expected the u&s;ual treatment of pri&s;oners of war, and were therefore the le&s;s vigorous in their defence; but they &s;oon found what mercy was to be expected from a &s;avage conqueror. They were all crowded together into a narrow pri&s;on, called the Black Hole, of about eighteen feet &s;quare, and re|ceiving air only by two &s;mall iron windows to the we&s;t, which by no means afforded a &s;ufficient circu|lation. It is terrible to reflect on the &s;ituation of the&s;e unfortunate men, &s;hut up in this narrow place, in the burning climate of the Ea&s;t, and &s;uffocating each other. Their fir&s;t efforts, upon perceiving the ef|fects of their horrid confinement, were to break open the door of the pri&s;on; but as it opened inward, they &s;oon found that impo&s;&s;ible. They next endeavoured to excite the compa&s;&s;ion or the avidity of the guard, by offering him a large &s;um of money for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in removing them to &s;eparate pri&s;ons; but with this he was not able to comply, as the viceroy was a&s;leep, and no per&s;on dared to di&s;turb him. They were now, therefore, left to die without hopes of relief; and the whole pri&s;on was filled with groans, &s;hrieks, conte&s;t, and de&s;pair. This turbulence, however, &s;oon after &s;unk into a calm &s;till more hideous; their efforts of
<PB N="341" REF="358">
&s;trength and courage were over, and an expiring lan|guor &s;ucceeded. In the morning when the keepers came to vi&s;it the pri&s;on, all was horror, &s;ilence, and de&s;olation. Of an hundred and forty-&s;ix who had entered alive, twenty-three only &s;urvived, and of the&s;e the greate&s;t part died of putrid fevers upon be|ing &s;et free.</P>
<P>The de&s;truction of this important fortre&s;s &s;erved to interrupt the pro&s;perous &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the Engli&s;h com|pany; but the fortune of Mr. Clive, backed by the activity of an Engli&s;h fleet under admiral Wat&s;on, &s;till turned the &s;cale in their favour. Among the number of tho&s;e who felt the power of the Engli&s;h in this part of the world, was the famous Tullagee An|gria, a piratical prince, who had long infe&s;ted the In|dian ocean, and made the princes on the coa&s;t his tributaries. He maintained a large number of gallies, and with the&s;e he attacked the large&s;t &s;hips, and al|mo&s;t ever with &s;ucce&s;s. As the company had been greatly harra&s;&s;ed by his depredations, they re|&s;olved to &s;ubdue &s;uch a dangerous enemy, and at|tack him in his own fortre&s;s. In pur&s;uance of this re&s;olution, admiral Wat&s;on and colonel Clive &s;ailed into his harbour of Geriah; and though they &s;u&s;|tained a warm fire as they entered, yet they &s;oon threw all his fleet into flames, and obliged his fort to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion. The conquerors found there a large quantity of warlike &s;tores, and effects to a con&s;iderable value.</P>
<P>Colonel Clive proceeded to take revenge for the cruelty practi&s;ed upon the Engli&s;h. About the be|ginning of December, he arrived at Bala&s;ore, in the kingdom of Bengal. He met with little oppo&s;ition either to the fleet or the army, till they came before Calcutta, which &s;eemed re&s;olved to &s;tand a regular &s;iege. As &s;oon as the admiral, with two &s;hips, ar|rived before the town, he received a furious fire from
<PB N="342" REF="359">
all the batteries, which he &s;oon returned with &s;till greater execution, and in le&s;s than two hours obliged them to abandon their fortifications. By the&s;e means the Engli&s;h took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the two &s;tronge&s;t &s;ettle|ments on the banks of the Ganges; but that of Ge|riah they demoli&s;hed to the ground.</P>
<P>Soon after the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es Hughly, a city of great trade, was reduced, with as little difficulty as the former, and all the viceroy of Bengal's &s;tore-hou&s;es and granaries were de&s;troyed. In order to repair the&s;e lo&s;&s;es this barbarous prince a&s;&s;embled an army of ten thou&s;and hor&s;e, and fifteen thou&s;and foot, and profe&s;&s;ed a firm re&s;olution of expelling the Engli&s;h from all their &s;ettlements in that part of the world. Upon the fir&s;t intelligence of his march colonel Clive, obtaining a reinforcement of men from the admiral's &s;hips, advanced with his little army to at|tack the&s;e numerous forces. He attacked the enemy in three columns, and though the numbers were &s;o di&s;proportioned, victory &s;oon declared in favour of the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h by the&s;e victories having placed a viceroy on the throne (for the Mogul had long lo&s;t all power in India) they took care to exact &s;uch &s;ti|pulations in their own favour as would &s;ecure them the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country whenever they thought proper to re&s;ume their authority. They were gratified in their avarice to its extreme&s;t wi&s;h; and that wealth which they had plundered from &s;laves in India they were re&s;olved to employ in mak|ing &s;laves at home.</P>
<P>From the conque&s;t of the Indians colonel Clive turned to the humbling of the French, who had long di&s;puted empire in that part of the world, and &s;oon di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them of all their power, and all their &s;ettlements.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="360">In the mean time, while conque&s;t &s;hined upon us from the Ea&s;t, it was &s;till more &s;plendid in the we&s;t|ern world. But &s;ome alterations in the mini&s;try led to tho&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es which had been long wi&s;hed for by the nation, and were at length obtained. The af|fairs of war had been hitherto directed by a mini&s;try, but ill &s;upported by the commons, becau&s;e not con|fided in by the people. They &s;eemed timid and wa|vering, and but feebly held together, rather by their fears than their mutual confidence. When any new mea&s;ure was propo&s;ed which could not receive their approbation, or any new member was introduced in|to government whom they did not appoint, they con&s;idered it as an infringement upon their re&s;pec|tive departments, and threw up their places in di&s;|gu&s;t, with a view to re&s;ume them with greater lu&s;tre. Thus the &s;trength of the crown was every day declining, while an ari&s;tocracy filled up every avenue to the throne, intent only on the emoluments, not the duties of office.</P>
<P>This was at that time the general opinion of the people, and it was too loud not to reach the throne. The mini&s;try that had hitherto hedged in the throne were at length obliged to admit &s;ome men into a &s;hare of the government, who&s;e activity at lea&s;t would counterbalance their timidity and irre&s;olution. At the head of the newly introduced party was the celebrated Mr. William Pitt, from who&s;e vigour the nation formed very great expectations, and they were not deceived.</P>
<P>But though the old mini&s;ters were obliged to ad|mit the&s;e new members into their &s;ociety, there was no legal penalty for refu&s;ing to operate with them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> they therefore a&s;&s;ociated with each other, and u&s;ed every art to make their new a&s;&s;i&s;tants obnoxious to the king, upon whom they had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> forced by the people. His former mini&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">

him in all his attachments to his German dominions, while the new had long clamoured again&s;t all conti|nental connections, as utterly incompatible with the intere&s;t of the nation. The&s;e two opinions carried to the extreme might have been erroneous; but the king was naturally led to &s;ide with tho&s;e who favour|ed his own &s;entiments, and to reject tho&s;e who op|po&s;ed them. Mr. Pitt, therefore, after being a few months in office, was ordered to re&s;ign by his ma|je&s;ty's command, and his coadjutor, Mr. Legge, was di&s;placed from being chancellor of the exchequer. But this blow to his ambition was but of &s;hort con|tinuance; the whole nation, almo&s;t to a man, &s;eemed to ri&s;e up in his defence, and Mr. Pitt and Mr. Legge being re&s;tored to their former employments, the one of &s;ecretary of &s;tate, the other of chancellor of the exchequer, began to act with vigour.</P>
<P>The con&s;equences of the former ill conducted coun&s;els &s;till &s;eemed to continue in America. The generals &s;ent over to manage the operations of the war, loudly accu&s;ed the timidity and delays of the na|tives, who&s;e duty it was to unite in their own defence. The natives on the other hand as warmly expo&s;tu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gain&s;t the pride, avarice, and incapacity of tho&s;e &s;ent over to command them. General Shirley who had been appointed to the &s;upreme command there, had been for &s;ome time recalled, and replaced by lord London; and this nobleman al&s;o &s;oon after returning to England, three &s;everal commanders were put at the head of &s;eparate operations. General Am|her&s;t commanded that de&s;igned again&s;t the i&s;land of Cape Breton. The other was con&s;igned to general Abercrombie, again&s;t Crown Point and Ticonderago; and the third &s;till more to the &s;outhward, again&s;t &s;ort du Que&s;ne, commanded by brigadier-general Forbes.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="362">Cape Breton, which had been taken from the French during the preceding war, had been re&s;tored at the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. It was not till the Engli&s;h had been put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that i&s;land that they began to perceive its advantageous &s;ituation, and the convenience of its harbour for annoying the Briti&s;h trade with impunity. It was al&s;o a conve|nient port for carrying on their fi&s;hery, a branch of commerce of the utmo&s;t benefit to that nation. The wre&s;ting it, therefore, once more from the hands of the French was a mea&s;ure ardently de&s;ired by the whole nation. The fortre&s;s of Loui&s;burg, by which it was defended, had been &s;trengthened by the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of art, and was &s;till better defended from the nature of its &s;ituation. The garri&s;on al&s;o was numerous, the commander vigilant, and every pre|caution taken to oppo&s;e a landing. An account of the operations of the &s;iege can give but little plea&s;ure in abridgment, be it &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that the Eng|li&s;h &s;urmounted every ob&s;tacle with great intrepidity. Their former timidity and irre&s;olution &s;eemed to va|ni&s;h, their natural courage and confidence returned, and the place &s;urrendered by capitulation. The for|tifications were &s;oon after demoli&s;hed, and rendered unfit for future protection.</P>
<P>The expedition to Fort du Que&s;ne was equally &s;uc|ce&s;sful, but that again&s;t Crown Point was once more defeated. This was now the &s;econd time that the Engli&s;h army bad attempted to penetrate into tho&s;e hideous wilds by which nature had &s;ecured the French po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in that part of the world. Braddock fell in the attempt a martyr to his impetuo&s;ity: too much caution was equally injurious to his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. Aber|crombie &s;pent much time in marching to the place of action, and the enemy were thus perfectly prepa|red to give him a &s;evere reception. As he approached Ticonderago he found them deeply intrenched at
<PB N="346" REF="363">
the foot of the &s;ort, and &s;till farther &s;ecured by fallen trees, with their branches pointing again&s;t him. The&s;e difficulties the Engli&s;h ardour attempted to &s;urmount, but as the enemy being &s;ecure in them|&s;elves, took aim at lei&s;ure, a terrible carnage of the a&s;&s;ailants en&s;ued, and the general, after repeated ef|forts, was obliged to order a retreat. The Engli&s;h army, however, were &s;till &s;uperior, and it was &s;up|po&s;ed that when the artillery was arrived &s;omething more &s;ucce&s;sful might be performed; but the general felt too &s;en&s;ibly the terrors of the late defeat to re|main in the neighbourhood of a triumphant enemy. He therefore withdrew his troops, and returned to his camp at Lake George, from whence he had taken his departure.</P>
<P>But though in this re&s;pect the Engli&s;h arms were un&s;ucce&s;sful, yet upon the whole the campaign was greatly in their favour. The taking of Fort du Que&s;ne &s;erved to remove from their colonies the terror of the incur&s;ions of the Indians, while it interrupted that corre&s;pondence which ran along a chain of &s;orts, with which the French had environed the Engli&s;h &s;ettlements in America. This, therefore, promi&s;ed a fortunate campaign the next year, and vigorous mea&s;ures were taken to en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Accordingly, on the opening of the following year, the mini&s;try, &s;en&s;ible that a &s;ingle effort carried on in &s;uch an exten&s;ive country could never reduce the ene|my, they re&s;olved to attack them in &s;everal parts of their empire at once. Preparations were al&s;o made, and expeditions driven forward again&s;t three differ|ent parts of North America at the &s;ame time. Ge|neral Amher&s;t, the commander in chief, with a bo|dy of twelve thou&s;and men, was to attack Crown Point, that had hitherto been the reproach of the Engli&s;h army. General Wolf was at the oppo&s;ite quarter to enter the river St. Lawrence, and under|take
<PB N="347" REF="364">
the &s;iege of Quebec, the capital of the French dominions in America; while general Prideaux and Sir William John&s;on were to attempt a French fort near the cataracts of Niagara.</P>
<P>The la&s;t named expedition was the fir&s;t that &s;uc|ceeded. The fort of Niagara was a place of great importance, and &s;erved to command all the commu|nication between the northern and we&s;tern French &s;ettlements. The &s;iege was begun with vigour, and promi&s;ed an ea&s;y conque&s;t, but general Prideaux was killed in the trenches by the bur&s;ting of a mortar; &s;o that the whole command of the expedition de|volved upon general John&s;on, who omitted nothing to pu&s;h forward the vigorous operations of his pre|dece&s;&s;or, to which al&s;o he added his own popularity with the &s;oldiers under him. A body of French troops, who were &s;en&s;ible of the importance of this fort, attempted to relieve it; but John&s;on attacked them with intrepidity and &s;ucce&s;s, for in le&s;s than an hour their whole army was put to the rout. The garri&s;on &s;oon after perceiving the fate of their coun|trymen, &s;urrendered pri&s;oners of war. The &s;ucce&s;s of general Amher&s;t was le&s;s &s;plendid, though not le&s;s &s;erviceable; upon arriving at the de&s;tined place he found the forts both of Crown Point and Ticon|derago de&s;erted and de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>There now, therefore, remained but one grand and deci&s;ive blow to put all North America into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h; and this was the taking of Quebec, the capital of Canada, a city hand&s;omely built, populous, and flouri&s;hing. Admiral Saun|ders was appointed to command the naval part of the expedition; the &s;iege by land was committed to the conduct of general Wolfe, of whom the nation had great expectations. This young &s;oldier who was not yet thirty-five, had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf on many former occa&s;ions, particularly at the &s;iege of
<PB N="348" REF="365">
Loui&s;burg;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1759.</NOTE> a part of the &s;ucce&s;s of which was ju&s;tly a&s;cribed to him, who, without being indebted to family or connections, had rai&s;ed him&s;elf by merit to his pre|&s;ent command.</P>
<P>The war in this part of the world had been hither|to carried on with extreme barbarity; and retaliating murders were continued without any one's knowing who fir&s;t began. Wolfe, however, di&s;dained to imitate an example that had been &s;et him even by &s;ome of his a&s;&s;ociate officers; he carried on the war with all the &s;pi|rit of humanity which it admits of. It is not our aim to enter into a minute detail of the &s;iege of this city, which could at be&s;t only give amu&s;ement to a few; it will be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that when we con&s;ider the &s;ituation of the town on the &s;ide of a great river, the fortifications with which it was &s;ecured, the na|tural &s;trength of the country, the great number of ve&s;&s;els and floating batteries the enemy had provided for the defence of the river, the numerous bodies of &s;avages continually hovering round the Engli&s;h ar|my, we mu&s;t own there was &s;uch a combination of difficulties as might di&s;courage and perplex the mo&s;t re&s;olute commander. The general him&s;elf &s;eemed perfectly &s;en&s;ible of the difficulty of the undertaking. After &s;tating, in a letter to the mini&s;try, the dangers that pre&s;ented,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I know, &s;aid he, that the affairs of Great Britain require the mo&s;t vigorous mea|&s;ures. But then the courage of an handful of brave men &s;hould be exerted only where there is &s;ome hope of a favourable event. At pre&s;ent the difficulties are &s;o various, that I am at a lo&s;s how to determine."</Q>
The only pro&s;pect of attempting the town with &s;ucce&s;s was by landing a body of troops in the night below the town, who were to clamber up the banks of the river, and take po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the ground on the back of the city. This attempt, however, appeared peculiarly di&s;couraging.
<PB N="349" REF="366">
The &s;tream was rapid, the &s;hore &s;helving, the bank above lined with centinels, the landing-place &s;o nar|row as to be ea&s;ily mi&s;&s;ed in the dark, and the &s;teep|ne&s;s of the ground &s;uch as hardly to be &s;urmounted in the day time. All the&s;e difficulties, however, were &s;urmounted by the conduct of the general, and the bravery of the men. Colonel Howe, with the light infantry and the Highlanders, a&s;cended the woody precipices with admirable courage and acti|vity, and di&s;lodged a &s;mall body of troops that defended a narrow path way up the bank; thus a few mounting, the general drew the re&s;t up in order as they arrived. Mon&s;ieur de Montcalm, the French commander, was no &s;ooner apprized that the Engli&s;h had gained the&s;e heights, which he had confidently deemed inacce&s;&s;ible, than he re&s;olved to hazard a battle; and a furious encounter quickly be|gan. This was one of the mo&s;t de&s;perate engage|ments during this war. The French general was &s;lain; the &s;econd in command &s;hared the &s;ame &s;ate. General Wolfe was &s;tationed on the right, where the attack was mo&s;t warm; as he &s;tood con&s;picuous in the front line, he had been aimed at by the ene|mies mark&s;men, and received a &s;hot in the wri&s;t, which, however, did not oblige him to quit the field. Having wrapped an handkerchief round his hand, he continued giving orders without the lea&s;t emotion, and advanced at the head of the grenadiers with their bayonets fixed; but a &s;econd ball more fatal, pierced his brea&s;t; &s;o that unable to proceed, he leaned on the &s;houlder of a &s;oldier that was next him. Now &s;truggling in the agonies of death, and ju&s;t expiring, he heard a voice cry, They run! upon which he &s;eemed for a moment to revive, and a&s;king who ran, was informed the French Expre&s;|&s;ing his wonder that they ran &s;o &s;oon, and unable to gaze any longer, he &s;unk on the &s;oldier's brea&s;t, and his la&s;t words were, "I die happy." Perhaps the
<PB N="350" REF="367">
lo&s;s of the Engli&s;h that day was greater than the con|que&s;t of Canada was advantageous. But it is the lot of mankind only to know true merit on that dreadful occa&s;ion, when they are going to lo&s;e it.</P>
<P>The &s;urrender of Quebec was the con&s;equence of this victory; and with it &s;oon after the total ce&s;|&s;ion of all Canada. The French, indeed, the follow|ing &s;ea&s;on made a vigorous effort to retake the city; but by the re&s;olution of governor Murray, and the ap|pearance of an Engli&s;h fleet under the command of lord Colville, they were obliged to abandon the en|terprize. The whole province was &s;oon after redu|ced by the prudence and activity of general Amher&s;t, who obliged the French army to capilulate, and it has &s;ince remained annexed to the Briti&s;h empire. To the&s;e conque&s;ts about the &s;ame time was added the re|duction of the i&s;land of Guadaloupe, under commo|dore More, and general Hop&s;on, an acqui&s;ition of great importance; but which was re&s;tored at the &s;uc|ceeding peace.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es in India and America were great, though atchieved by no very expen&s;ive efforts; on the contrary, the efforts the Engli&s;h made in Europe, and the operations of their great ally, the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, were a&s;toni&s;hing, yet produced no &s;ignal ad|vantages.</P>
<P>England was all this time happily retired from the mi&s;eries which oppre&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of Europe: yet from her natural military ardour &s;he &s;eemed de&s;irous of &s;haring tho&s;e dangers, of which &s;he was only a &s;pec|tator. This pa&s;&s;ion for &s;haring in a continental war was not le&s;s plea&s;ing to the king of England, from his native attachments, than from a de&s;ire of revenge upon the plunderers of his country. As &s;oon there|fore as it was known that prince Ferdinand had put him&s;elf at the head of the Hanoverian army, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, his Britannic maje&s;ty, in a

&s;pcech to his parliament, ob&s;erved that the late &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es of his ally in Germany had given an happy turn to his affairs, which it would be nece&s;&s;ary to improve. The commons concurred in his &s;entiments, and libe|rally granted &s;upplies both for the &s;ervice of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, and for enabling the army formed in Hanover to act vigorou&s;ly in conjunction with him.</P>
<P>From &s;ending money over into Germany, the na|tion began to extend their benefits; and it was &s;oon con&s;idered that men would be a more grateful &s;up|ply. Mr. Pitt, who had at fir&s;t come into popularity and power by oppo&s;ing &s;uch mea&s;ures, was now pre|vailed on to enter into them with even greater ardour than any of his predece&s;&s;ors. The hopes of putting a &s;peedy end to the war by vigorous mea&s;ures, the connexions with which he was obliged to co operate, and perhaps the plea&s;ure he found in plea&s;ing the king, all together incited him eagerly to pu&s;h forward a continental war. However, he only con&s;pired with the general inclinations of the people at this time, who, allured by the noble efforts of their only ally, were unwilling to &s;ee him fall a &s;acrifice to the united am|bition of his enemies.</P>
<P>In order to indulge this general inclination of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, the duke of Marlborough was at fir&s;t &s;ent into Germany with a &s;mall body of Bri|ti&s;h forces to join with prince Ferdinand, who&s;e acti|vity again&s;t the French began to be crowned with &s;ucce&s;s. After &s;ome &s;mall &s;ucce&s;&s;es gained by the allied army at Crevelt, the duke of Marlborough dying, his com|mand devolved upon lord George Sackville, who was at that time a favourite with the Engli&s;h army. How|ever a mi&s;under&s;tanding aro&s;e between him and the commander in chief, which &s;oon had an occa&s;ion of being di&s;played at the battle of Minden, which was &s;ought &s;oon after. The cau&s;e of this &s;ecret di&s;gu&s;t on
<PB N="352" REF="369">
both &s;ides is not clearly known; it is thought that the exten&s;ive genius, and the inqui&s;itive &s;pirit of the Engli&s;h general, were by no means agreeable to his &s;uperior in command, who hoped to reap &s;ome pecuniary advantages the other was unwilling to per|mit. Be this as it will, both armies advancing near the town of Minden, the French began the attack with great vigour, and a general engagement of the infantry en&s;ued. Lord George, at the head of the Briti&s;h and Hanoverian hor&s;e, was &s;tationed at &s;ome di&s;tance on the right of the infantry, from which they were divided by a &s;canty wood that bordered on an heath. The French infantry giving ground, the prince thought that this would be a favourable oppor|tunity to pour down the hor&s;e among them, and ac|cordingly &s;ent lord George orders to come on. The&s;e orders were but ill obeyed; and whether they were unintelligible, or contradictory, &s;till remains a point for po&s;terity to debate upon. It is certain that lord George &s;hortly after was recalled, tried by a court-martial, found guilty, and declared incapable of &s;erving in any military command for the future. The enemy however were repul&s;ed in all their attacks with con&s;iderable lo&s;s, and at length giving way were pur|&s;ued to the very ramparts of Minden. The victory was &s;plendid, but laurels were the only advantage reaped from the field of battle.</P>
<P>After the&s;e victories, which were greatly magnified in England, it was &s;uppo&s;ed that one reinforcement more of Briti&s;h troops would terminate the war in favour of the allies, and a reinforcement was quickly &s;ent. The Briti&s;h army in Germany now, therefore, amounted to above thirty thou&s;and men, and the whole nation was flu&s;hed with the hopes of immediate conque&s;t. But the&s;e hopes &s;oon vani&s;hed in finding victory and defeat &s;ucce&s;&s;ively following each other.
<PB N="353" REF="370" MS="y">
The allies were wor&s;ted at Corbach; but re|trieved their honour at Exdorf. A victory at War|bourg followed &s;hortly after, and another at Zie|renberg; but then they &s;uffered a defeat at Compen, after which both &s;ides went into winter quarters. The &s;ucce&s;&s;es thus on either &s;ide might be con&s;ider|ed as a compact by which both engaged to lo&s;e much, and gain little; for no advantages whatever followed from victory. The Engli&s;h at length be|gan to open their eyes to their own intere&s;t, and found that they were waging unequal war, and load|ing them&s;elves with taxes for conque&s;ts that they could neither pre&s;erve nor enjoy.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that the efforts of England at this time, over ever part of the globe, were ama|zing; and the expence of her operations greater than had ever been di&s;bur&s;ed by any nation before. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia received a &s;ub&s;idy; a large body of Engli&s;h forces commanded the exten&s;ive penin&s;ula of India; another army of twenty thou&s;and men con|firmed their conque&s;ts in North America; there were thirty thou&s;and men employed in Germany, and &s;everal other bodies di&s;per&s;ed in the different gar|ri&s;ons in various parts of the world; but all the&s;e were nothing to the force maintained at &s;ea, which carried command wherever it came, and had totally annihilated the French power on that element. The courage and the conduct of the Engli&s;h admirals had &s;urpa&s;&s;ed whatever had been read of in hi&s;tory; neither &s;uperior force, nor number, nor even the terrors of the tempe&s;t could intimidate them. Admiral Hawke gained a complete victory over an equal number of French &s;hips, on the coa&s;t of Bretagne, in Quiberon Bay, in the mid&s;t of a tempe&s;t, during the darkne&s;s of the night, and what a &s;eamen fears &s;till more, upon a rocky &s;hore.</P>
<P><PB N="354" REF="371">Such was the glorious figure the Briti&s;h nation ap|peared in to all the world at this time. But while their arms pro&s;pered in every effort tending to the real intere&s;ts of the nation, an event happened, which for a while ob&s;cured the &s;plendour of her victories. On the twenty-fifth of October, the king, without having complained of any previous di&s;order, was found, by his dome&s;tics, expiring in his chamber. He had ari&s;en at his u&s;ual hour, and ob&s;erved to his attendants, that as the weather was fine he would take a walk into the gardens of Ken&s;ington, where he then re&s;ided. In a few minutes after his return, being left alone, he was heard to fall down upon the floor. The noi&s;e of this bringing his attendants into the room, they lifted him into bed, where he de&s;ired, with a faint voice, that the prince&s;s Amelia might be &s;ent for, but before &s;he could reach the apartment he expired. An attempt was made to bleed him, but without effect; and afterwards, the &s;urgeons, upon opening him, di&s;covered that the right ventricle of the heart was actually ruptured, and that a great quantity of blood was di&s;charged through the aper|ture.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 25, 1760.</NOTE>George the Second died in the &s;eventy-&s;eventh year of his age, and the thirty-third of his reign; lamented by his &s;ub|jects, and in the mid&s;t of victory. If any monarch was happy in the peculiar mode of his death, and the preci&s;e time of its arrival, it was he. The univer&s;al enthu&s;ia&s;m of the people for conque&s;t was now beginning to &s;ub&s;ide, and &s;ober rea&s;on to take her turn in the admini&s;tration of affairs. The fac|tions which had been nur&s;ing during his long reign, had not yet come to maturity; but threatened, with all their virulence, to afflict his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. He was, him&s;elf, of no &s;hining abilities; and while he was permited to guide and a&s;&s;i&s;t his German dominions,
<PB N="355" REF="372">
he entru&s;ted the care of Britain to his mini&s;ters at home. However as we &s;tand too near to be impar|tial judges of his merits or defects, let us &s;tate his character as delivered by two writers of oppo&s;ite opi|nions.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"On whatever &s;ide," &s;ays his panegyri&s;t, "we look upon his character, we &s;hall find ample matter for ju&s;t and un&s;u&s;pected prai&s;e. None of his prede|ce&s;&s;ors on the throne of England, lived to &s;o great an age, or enjoyed longer felicity. His &s;ubjects were &s;till improving under him, in commerce and arts; and his own oeconomy &s;et a prudent example to the nation, which, however, they did not follow. He was, in his temper, &s;udden and violent; but this, though it influenced his conduct, made no change in his behaviour, which was generally guided by rea|&s;on. He was plain and direct in his intentions; true to his word, &s;teady in his favour and protection to his &s;ervants, nor parting even with his mini&s;ters till compelled to it by the violence of faction. In &s;hort, through the whole of his life he appeared rather to live for the cultivation of u&s;eful virtues than &s;plendid ones; and &s;atisfied with being good, left others their unenvied greatne&s;s."</Q></P>
<P>Such is the picture given by his friends, but there are others who rever&s;e the medal. "As to the ex|tent of his under&s;tanding, or the &s;plendour of his vir|tue, we rather wi&s;h for opportunities of prai&s;e, than undertake the ta&s;k our&s;elves. His public character was marked with a predilection for his native coun|try, and to that he &s;acrificed all other con&s;iderations. He was not only unlearned him&s;elf, but he de&s;pi&s;ed learning in others; and though genius might have flouri&s;hed in his reign, yet he neither promoted it by his influence or example. His frugality bordered upon avarice, and he hoarded not for his &s;ubjects, but him&s;elf. He was remarkable for no one great vir|tue,
<PB N="356" REF="373">
and was known to practi&s;e &s;everal of the meaner vices." Which of the&s;e two characters are true, or whether they may not in part be both &s;o, I will not pretend to decide. If his favourers are numerous, &s;o are tho&s;e who oppo&s;e them; let po&s;terity, therefore, decide the conte&s;t.</P>
