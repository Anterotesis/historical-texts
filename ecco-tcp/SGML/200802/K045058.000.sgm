<SPEAKER>G. Bu&s;y.</SPEAKER>
<P>O &s;ad, O &s;ad! what pity it is that young Men &s;hould &s;pend their Time unfruitfully with naughty Women; when, were they hone&s;tly married, they might in a lawful way do much good in their Generation. If you have any Thoughts of Marriage, I have a Widow in my Eye, that would do very well for you. She has &s;omething to bring you to, and is un|der Thirty I a&s;&s;ure you. While her Husband was in Health, &s;he brought him a Child every Year; but I don't know how it fell out, he grew weary of her, and, as it is &s;uppos'd, thought to have kill'd her with Kindne&s;s: but as it always happens in tho&s;e Ca&s;es, he did his own Bu&s;ine&s;s in&s;tead of hers, he fell in|to a Con&s;umption&mdash;and dy'd about a Month ago.</P>

<SPEAKER>Jon.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Goody <HI>Bu&s;y,</HI> that will never do for me; a wanton young Widow for a Wife, and a skitti&s;h Hor&s;e for a long Journey, are two the mo&s;t trouble&s;ome things a Man can meet withal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Bu&s;y.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps you would rather have a Maid. Truly they are tickli&s;h things, and I don't much care to meddle or make with 'em. But I do know of a Farmer's Daughter, that will fit you to a Hair. Her Father is a &s;ufficient Man, and will &s;tock a Farm for you. 'Tis true, indeed, &s;he has had one Child; for I am a Woman of Integrity, and would not deceive any Body in the&s;e matters for the World. They did not marry her &s;oon enough. But &s;he'll make an excellent &s;tirring Wife, I'll warrant her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jon.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Maid that has had a Child, is wor&s;e than a Widow that's pa&s;t it. I don't like any Body that you have propos'd half &s;o well as your&s;elf.</P>
