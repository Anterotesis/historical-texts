<HEAD>The HUMBLE PETITION of the Planters of his Maje&s;ty's Sugar Colonies re&s;iding in GREAT-BRITAIN, and of the Merchants of London trading to the &s;aid Colonies,</HEAD>
<OPENER>SHEWETH,</OPENER>
<P>THAT your Petitioners are exceedingly alarmed at an Agreement and A&s;&s;ociation, entered into by the Congre&s;s, held at the city of Philadelphia in North-America, on the 5th day of September, 1774, whereby the members thereof agreed and a&s;&s;ociated, for them&s;elves and the inhabitants of the &s;everal provinces, (lying between Nova Scotia and Georgia) that from and after the fir&s;t day of December, 1774, they would not import into Briti&s;h America any Mela&s;&s;es, Syrups, Pa|neles, Coffee or Pimento from the Briti&s;h Plantations; and that, after the 10th day of September, 1775, if the acts and the parts
<PB N="4" REF="3">
of Acts of the Briti&s;h Parliament, therein mentioned, are not repealed, they would not directly or indirectly export any merchandize or commodity what&s;oever to the We&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>And your Petitioners mo&s;t humbly repre|&s;ent, that the Briti&s;h property or &s;tock ve&s;ted in the We&s;t-India i&s;lands amounts to upwards of thirty millions &s;terling: That a further property of many millions is employed in the commerce created by the &s;aid i&s;lands; a com|merce comprehending Africa, the Ea&s;t-Indies and Europe: That the whole profits and produce of the&s;e capitals ultimately center in Great-Britain, and add to the national wealth, while the navigation nece&s;&s;ary to all its branches e&s;tabli&s;hes a &s;trength, which wealth can neither purcha&s;e nor balance.</P>
<P>That the &s;ugar plantations in the We&s;t-In|dies are &s;ubject to a greater variety of contin|gencies, than many other &s;pecies of property, from their nece&s;&s;ary dependence on external &s;upport; and that therefore &s;hould any inter|ruption happen in the general &s;y&s;tem of their commerce, the great national &s;tock, thus ve&s;ted and employed, mu&s;t become unprofit|able and precarious.</P>
<P>That the profits ari&s;ing from the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the &s;aid i&s;lands, and that are likely to ari&s;e from their future improvement, in a great mea&s;ure depend on a free and reciprocal intercour&s;e between them and the &s;everal pro|vinces of North-America, from whence they are furni&s;hed with provi&s;ions and other &s;up|plies,
<PB N="5" REF="4">
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;upport and the maintenance of their plantations: That the &s;carcity and high price in Great-Britain, and other parts of Europe, of tho&s;e articles of indi&s;pen&s;able nece&s;&s;ity, which they now derive from the Middle Colonies of America, and the inadequate population in &s;ome parts of that continent, with the di&s;tance, danger, and uncertainty of the navigation, from others, forbid your petitioners to hope for a &s;upply in any degree proportionate to their wants.</P>
<P>That if the fir&s;t part of the &s;aid Agree|ment and A&s;&s;ociation for a Non-importation hath taken place, and &s;hall be continued, the &s;ame will be highly detrimental to the Sugar Colonies; and that if the &s;econd part of the &s;aid Agreement and A&s;&s;ociation for a Non|exportation &s;hall be carried into execution, which your Petitioners do firmly believe will happen, unle&s;s the harmony that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted a few years &s;ince between this kingdom and the provinces of America, to the infinite advantage of both, be re&s;tored; the i&s;lands which are &s;upplied with mo&s;t of their &s;ub&s;i&s;|tence from thence will be reduced to the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, and the trade between all the i&s;lands and this kingdom will of cour&s;e be ob&s;tructed, to the diminution of the Public Revenue, to the ruin of mo&s;t of the Planters, and to the great prejudice of the Merchants: not only by the &s;aid ob&s;truction, but al&s;o by the delay of payment of the principal and
<PB N="6" REF="5">
intere&s;t of an immen&s;e debt, due from the former to the latter.</P>
<P>Your Petitioners do therefore mo&s;t humbly pray, that this Honourable Hou&s;e will be plea&s;ed to take into their mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;i|deration that great political &s;y&s;tem of the Colonies, heretofore &s;o very beneficial to the Mother Country and her dependencies, and adopt &s;uch mea&s;ures as to them in their great wi&s;dom &s;hall &s;eem meet, to prevent the evils with which your Petitioners are threatened, and to pre&s;erve the intercour&s;e between the We&s;t-India i&s;lands and the Northern Colonies, to the general harmony and la&s;ting benefit of the whole Briti&s;h empire; and that they may be heard by them&s;elves, their Agents, or Council, in &s;upport of their Petition.</P>

<P>The Petitioners were referred to a Com|mittee of the whole Hou&s;e, and on the 16th day of March en&s;uing were admitted to a hearing; which was opened in the following manner by their Agent, Mr. Glover, Mer|chant of the city of London.</P>

<HEAD>THE SUBSTANCE OF THE EVIDENCE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Appear in the behalf, and by the appoint|ment of the Planters and Merchants con|cerned in the We&s;t-Indies, who have pre&s;ented to this honourable Hou&s;e an humble Petition, &s;etting forth the great danger to them&s;elves, to the navigation, revenue and commerce of the&s;e kingdoms, in con&s;equence of an Agree|ment and A&s;&s;ociation entered into by a meeting, held at Philadelphia, on the fifth day of September, 1774.</P>
<P>I bend under the weight of a &s;ubject &s;o awful; a weight increa&s;ed by my own thoughts anticipating calamities, in which every inhabitant throughout this exten&s;ive empire, more or le&s;s, may have a &s;hare: at the &s;ame time, con&s;cious as I am, that a nation is behind me generally unfavourable to my undertaking. But above all, I am fearful of a wide difference in &s;entiments between this great auditory, and the incon|&s;iderable individual at their bar.</P>
<P>I re&s;t, however, upon one con&s;olation, that whatever may be the &s;tate of your minds and of all be&s;ides; in every &s;tate, whether of
<PB N="8" REF="7">
dejection or elevation; in every conjuncture, whether adver&s;e or pro&s;perous; let me &s;ay, in all time of our tribulation, in all time of our wealth, information hath its u&s;e, know|ledge is &s;alutary; and when pre&s;ented in their genuine &s;implicity, untainted by pre|judice, pa&s;&s;ion, or party; not looking towards any one quarter in preference to another; without courting any; meaning to offend none; but &s;oliciting the attention of all; information and knowledge in &s;uch a &s;hape cannot be unacceptable to any a&s;&s;embly, and I am confident will be acceptable here.</P>
<P>To throw lights into the Committee is the &s;ole object of your Petitioners, limiting them|&s;elves to the line of facts, which from their peculiar &s;ituation none can fully explain, but &s;uch as them&s;elves. I &s;hall a&s;k no opi|nion from witne&s;&s;es, and if a&s;ked from any other quarter, the an&s;wer will be, that to e&s;tabli&s;h facts is their part, to judge and decide is yours: Opinion therefore might be con&s;tructive pre&s;umption in them, like an interference with the coun&s;els and mea&s;ures of the &s;tate; whereas they entertain but one expectation, that the information, delivered this day, if not in the pre&s;ent juncture, may be found of &s;ome utility at &s;ome future period during a portentous &s;eries of events, who&s;e final i&s;&s;ue is known only to him, who alone knows all things.</P>
<P>I proceed, Sir, upon another con&s;olation, in thinking my&s;elf &s;ecure of one merit with
<PB N="9" REF="8">
the Committee; that upon the pre&s;ent &s;ubject the variety of matter, already lying before you, might by a variety and multitude of witne&s;&s;es be prolonged, perhaps, for twenty days; and that I can pledge my&s;elf &s;o far, as re&s;ts upon me, to di&s;patch the whole in le&s;s than half that number of hours. I &s;hall call but two witne&s;&s;es, from who&s;e evidence, and from a very few papers re&s;pecting the colonies out of the large quantity, tran&s;|mitted by office to the Hou&s;e, it &s;hall be endeavoured to give you a clear in&s;ight into the two capital branches of Colony-trade, the We&s;t-Indian, the North-American, and the immediate dependent upon both, the African, with the relations and proportions of each towards the other, and towards the &s;everal great intere&s;ts, the manufacture, com|merce, navigation, revenue and land of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>After the examination of Mr. Walker and Mr. Ellis, the whole was &s;ummed up, as follows;</P>
<P>SIR,</P>
<P>HAVING clo&s;ed the examination of wit|ne&s;&s;es, I mu&s;t recur to my introductory propo&s;ition; that from the evidence at your bar, and the official papers upon your table, it &s;hall be endeavoured to give the Commit|tee a clear in&s;ight into the two capital bran|ches of Colony-trade, the We&s;t-Indian, the North-American, and the immediate de|pendent
<PB N="10" REF="9">
upon both, the African; with the relations and proportions of each towards the other, and towards the &s;everal great intere&s;ts, the manufacture, commerce, na|vigation, revenue and land of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>Finding my auditory &s;o much dimini&s;hed in number, I mu&s;t &s;upply the void by ima|gination, pre&s;enting to my view the genius of the place, the maje&s;tic genius of parliament, holding a balance to weigh the future for|tunes of kingdoms, with an impartial hand ready to receive the weights peculiar to each &s;cale; and con&s;cious, that the welfare, per|haps the being of a whole empire depend on the turn.</P>
<P>I begin with inve&s;tigating the general &s;y&s;tem of that empire, not only in de&s;crip|tion, but illu&s;tration by compari&s;on.</P>
<P>Ancient nations were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the wide&s;t dominion, not with commercial helps. To be brief, I &s;hall confine the enquiry to one, to the Romans in their ages of purity. Cultivation of their &s;oil, rude manufacture ju&s;t adequate to their nece&s;&s;ities, &s;everity of manners, &s;uperiority in martial di&s;cipline, enthu&s;ia&s;m for the very name of Rome, and the <HI>dulce &amp; decorum pro patria mori</HI> made them ma&s;ters of the world. War was con|ducted with little expence, and the weightie&s;t arms in the mo&s;t &s;kilful hands prevailed. Commerce flouri&s;hed among others, who&s;e affluence &s;ubmitted to the &s;teel of Rome.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10">
What is the &s;y&s;tem now? All over Europe the &s;ame weapons, the &s;ame di&s;cipline, the &s;ame military arts are in practice; war is attended with a profu&s;ion of expence; and the deepe&s;t pur&s;e is the be&s;t a&s;&s;urance of &s;uc|ce&s;s. Hence the encouragement of manu|facture and trade is the pur&s;uit of every na|tion in this quarter of the globe except two; who derive the trea&s;ure, which Europe wants, from di&s;tant mines with a facility, enervating their own indu&s;try, while the re&s;t are ex|erting theirs, each for a &s;hare in that wealth, which the other two introduce, and can only be obtained through the commercial channel. By this Holland with a territory in&s;ufficient to nouri&s;h her inhabitants, hath in her day &s;tood forth a bulwark again&s;t tyranny and &s;uper&s;tition. An artificial &s;trength, created by commerce, enabled her to make head with numerous fleets and armies again&s;t powers immen&s;ely her &s;uperiors in natural force. Above all in commercial arts and advantage is Great-Britain. Her pur&s;e, kept full by her credit, the re&s;ource of a trading nation, an annual expenditure at length of &s;ixteen to eighteen millions recently &s;uppor|ted &s;o long, &s;o exten&s;ive, and &s;o vigorous a war. Had her pur&s;e been &s;canty, &s;he never would have &s;een a navy, which bore little &s;hort of ninety thou&s;and men, could never have engaged a potent ally, nor furni&s;hed &s;uch troops, as acted &s;o efficiently, and at the &s;ame time in &s;uch different parts of the
<PB N="12" REF="11">
globe. Hence it is evident, her &s;y&s;tem is commercial; her &s;trength and re&s;ources are wholly derived from trade. I allow, the fir&s;t intere&s;t in rank among us is the landed, but interwoven altogether with trade. Pay no regard to a doctrine from me, but pay all to the &s;upreme authority of the cleare&s;t lumi|nary, this country ever produced, the great Mr. Locke. His words are the&s;e,<Q REND="inline margQuotes"> "The decays, that come upon, and bring to ruin any country, do con&s;tantly fir&s;t fall upon the land; and though the country gentle|man is not very forward to think &s;o, yet this neverthele&s;s is an undoubted truth; that he is more concerned in trade, and ought to take a greater care, that it be well managed and pre&s;erved, than even the merchant him&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>On the firm ground of &s;uch authority let enquiry be made, whether we &s;hould not remain content with the lot a&s;&s;igned us, which hath rai&s;ed us &s;o high among the modern nations, where all are in rivalry for manufacture and trade; whether we &s;hould degrade our refinements by a parallel with an unpoli&s;hed and rugged race of old, and contaminate the delicacy of modern &s;en&s;ations with tho&s;e primitive and &s;tern principles, which impo&s;ed &s;uch a yoke on mankind as the <HI>maje&s;tas populi Romani:</HI> or whether, confining our &s;peculations to the placid &s;phere of enjoyments with more quiet, and le&s;s hazard, than the re&s;tle&s;s pur&s;uits of their
<PB N="13" REF="12">
ambition, we &s;hould not have in contempla|tion upon all extraordinary convul&s;ions, how far the means of tho&s;e enjoyments may be affected, that influx of wealth, the creature of commerce, which &s;olely con&s;titutes our envied power and rank in the pre&s;ent world.</P>
<P>To elucidate by facts a &s;y&s;tem &s;o e&s;&s;ential to our being, your Petitioners have appeared at this tremendous cri&s;is; when Great-Britain and America, the parent and the child with equal irritation are menacing at lea&s;t, what barely in words, what barely in thought is horror&mdash;to un&s;heathe the &s;word of parricide, and &s;ever the deare&s;t ties of con&s;anguinity, of mutual aids, and general pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>Your Petitioners preferr'd but one &s;uppli|cation to the All-merciful Being; their own rea&s;on &s;ugge&s;ted no other, than to be heard by you. He hath inclined you to hear, truth enables us to &s;peak. Truth in its nature is healing, and productive of reflection: reflec|tion leads to compo&s;ure of mind, and &s;trengthens in our brea&s;ts a hope, that an hour may come, when this humble application may not be found altogether ineffectual: if too for that au&s;picious purpo&s;e it may prove my good fortune &s;o to collect, and combine the various evidence from your bar, and from the copied records of office upon your table, as to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;y&s;tem of the whole, and found that whole upon truth; who&s;e efficacy upon the mind I have de&s;cribed before, and with &s;ome fervour of hope anticipate now.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13">
Here, Sir, I entreat your acceptance of a clew through the &s;eeming labyrinth of ac|counts. The ways indeed are all unadorned, but the lea&s;t perplex'd of any to a little attention; and to make them &s;hort &s;hall be mine.</P>
<P>You have before you official accounts of the exports from England to the We&s;t-Indies from Chri&s;tmas 1739, to Chri&s;tmas, 1773. Of the&s;e thirty-four years the fir&s;t &s;eventeen, ending at Chri&s;tmas, 1756, form a period, which clo&s;es in the fir&s;t year of the la&s;t war. The whole value exceeds twelve millions, and gives an annual medium of more than 700,000l. The la&s;t period of &s;eventeen years ends at Chri&s;tmas, 1773, and renders a total of more than nineteen millions, and more than 1,100,000l. at the annual medium. I only ob&s;erve in this place, that the increa&s;e of the latter upon the former is in the propor|tion of eleven to &s;even; and of the value in both two thirds are Briti&s;h goods, and one third only foreign.</P>
<P>A &s;econd &s;et of accounts contain the ex|ports to North-America. The fir&s;t &s;eventeen years yield more than &s;eventeen millions in the whole, and than one million at the annual medium. The la&s;t period renders more than forty millions in the whole, and largely more than 2,300,000l. at the annual medium; an increa&s;e upon the former in a proportion of twenty-three to ten, with a value in both of three fourths Briti&s;h goods to one fourth foreign.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14">
The third account relates to Africa, who&s;e commerce with England owes its exi&s;tence to her colonies. The fir&s;t &s;eventeen years reach nearly to three millions, and to an annual medium &s;omething &s;hort of 180,000l. the la&s;t &s;eventeen years nearly to eight millions, and an annual medium of 470,000l. an increa&s;e upon the fir&s;t in a proportion of forty-&s;even to eighteen, with a value in each of two thirds Briti&s;h goods to one third foreign.</P>
<P>On this augmentation of exports to your Colonies, irrefragable proof is founded, that through whatever channels riches have flow'd among them, that influx hath made a pa&s;&s;age from them to the Mother Country, and in the mo&s;t whole&s;ome mode; not like the da&s;h of an oriental torrent, but in &s;alubrious, various, placid and copious &s;treams, refre&s;hing and augmenting &s;ober indu&s;try by additional em|ployment to thou&s;ands and ten thou&s;ands of families, and lightening the burden upon rents by reducing the contribution of pari&s;hes to poverty unemployed.</P>
<P>But this requires a further explanation. The date of the la&s;t period is the commence|ment of the la&s;t war. The expenditure of public money was one &s;ource of wealth to the We&s;t-Indies. That temporary acqui&s;i|tion being &s;oon exhau&s;ted by its return to England, &s;ufficient &s;ums were procured upon credit after the peace to cultivate new land, and improve the old, &s;till further enlarging the con&s;umption of our commodities there
<PB N="16" REF="15">
and in Africa, that from the year of the peace to Chri&s;tmas, 1773, the import of &s;ugar only to England, who without her We&s;t-In|dies mu&s;t purcha&s;e that immen&s;e article from foreigners, hath ri&s;en from 130,000 to 170,000 hog&s;heads, an augmentation in value of 800,000 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>The public expenditure, being much larger in North America, produc'd a proportionate effect on the con&s;umption of our manufac|tures through that continent. This money return'd from its peregrination to the Mother Country by 1764, or 1765 at the furthe&s;t. But, as the We&s;t-Indies had a &s;uccedaneum, &s;o had North-America through a new open|ing of trade, which converted the misfortune of England into a ble&s;&s;ing. Though I am convinc'd, that the &s;ame number of hands at lea&s;t is devoted to agriculture here, and that the earth at a medium of years hath yielded the &s;ame increa&s;e; as we have been di&s;pos'd to con&s;ume it all among our&s;elves, or as our pre&s;umption may impute the &s;carcity to Pro|vidence, re&s;training the fertility of our &s;oil for ten years pa&s;t, in either ca&s;e we could not &s;pare, as heretofore, our grain to the fo|reigner; a reduction in our exports one year with another of more than 600,000 <HI>l.</HI> The American &s;ubjects took place of the Briti&s;h in markets, we could no longer &s;upply, ex|tended their vent from &s;ea&s;on to &s;ea&s;on, and from port to port, and by a circuition of fre&s;h money, thus acquir'd by them&s;elves, added
<PB N="17" REF="16">
fre&s;h numbers to your manufactures, the rents of land increa&s;ing at the &s;ame time, till the amount of exports to North America for the la&s;t three years, ending at Chri&s;tmas 1773, &s;tand upon your papers at ten millions and a half, or three millions and a half at the annual medium; add 1,300,000 <HI>l.</HI> the medium of the &s;ame three years for the We&s;t-Indies, and 700,000 <HI>l.</HI> for Africa, and the total value of exports to the colonies, nearly in a proportion of three fourths Bri|ti&s;h to one fourth foreign goods, is five mil|lions and a half at the medium of the&s;e three years, ending at Chri&s;tmas, 1773. A &s;light matter this to the great que&s;tion before you, &s;ays the general voice without doors, and readily admitted without the ceremony of proof. This I mention by way of preparation to introduce the mo&s;t material account of all; which will demon&s;trate, that the mag|nitude of five millions and a half, exported in the Colony branches, the We&s;t-Indian, North-American and African, is not to be con&s;idered as an object &s;o &s;triking in it&s;elf, as in compari&s;on with the whole export of England to all countries what&s;oever. The annual medium for twelve years back &s;tands on the&s;e papers at le&s;s than fifteen millions; but as I have limited the Colony branch to 1771, 2 and 3, I &s;hall take the general ex|ports during that period, which renders a medium of &s;ixteen millions. What part is the Colony branch? Five and a half is ra|ther
<PB N="18" REF="17">
more, than a third. Does the magni|tude appear in a &s;tronger light by the compa|ri&s;on? Or hath it been admitted in this view, before it was &s;tated? Be it &s;o. I have &s;ome|thing behind, perhaps enough for the keen|e&s;t appetite of admi&s;&s;ion to dige&s;t.</P>
<P>Sir, one part of our exports to foreigners is &s;upplied by Colony produce, tobacco, rice, &s;ugar, &amp;c. through Great-Britain, for a million &s;terling at a low e&s;timation. Add two millions more, exported of all kinds from England to her principal Colony, Ire|land, and both to the former five millions and a half; your whole Colony branch will then exceed the half of your whole export in the proportion of eight and a half to &s;ixteen.</P>
<P>Thanks to the care and foreca&s;t of our forefathers one hundred and twenty years &s;ince. In the circle of antient trade, narrow in compari&s;on with the modern, the great trading &s;tates, Carthage pre-eminent to all, &s;uffered but little from rival&s;hip. All in Europe are our rivals, all devoted to manu|facture and traffic, as capital pur&s;uits of po|licy: while we &s;truggling with &s;uch compe|tition, have in &s;ome in&s;tances already expe|rienc'd its hurtful effects, and mu&s;t prepare for more; we had always one con&s;olation left, that our colony-trade, kept to our&s;elves by old and &s;alutary regulations, hath been augmenting from period to period, till at pre&s;ent it con&s;titutes more, than half of the
<PB N="19" REF="18">
whole, with a pro&s;pect of further growth, rather than diminution, unle&s;s we create our own rivals.</P>
<P>One more ob&s;ervation remains of all the mo&s;t important, &s;o far as &s;afety to a &s;tate is a con&s;ideration above all others. Of this trade the part, which depends on the a&s;&s;o|ciated provinces, contributes in naval &s;tores, in other low pric'd and bulky commodities more to the Briti&s;h marine, than triple the pre&s;ent exports in commodities of &s;uch higher value, and &s;hipp'd &s;o largely in foreign bottoms to the foreign market.

<P>Upon the pre&s;ent que&s;tion I will not take that larger half before-mentioned for my ground.

<P>Having been hitherto merely general, I mu&s;t now de&s;cend to a detail, but of parts &s;o large, that each is &s;eparately big with &s;uf|ficient evils to draw the utmo&s;t &s;tretch of your attention. I begin with tho&s;e, which threaten the We&s;t Indies.</P>
<P>To recapitulate the heads of that material evidence, delivered by Mr. Walker and Mr. Ellis, would be tedious in me, unnece&s;&s;ary in it&s;elf. Leaving it therefore to its own powerful impre&s;&s;ion, I here add only in a general mode of my own, that of the inha|bitants

in tho&s;e i&s;lands above four hundred thou&s;and are blacks; from who&s;e labour the immen&s;e riches there, &s;o di&s;tinctly prov'd at your bar, are deriv'd with &s;uch immen&s;e ad|vantage to the&s;e kingdoms. How far the&s;e multitudes, if their intercour&s;e with North-America is &s;topp'd, may be expo&s;ed to fa|mine, you have heard.

The &s;ame mu&s;t be the practice in great part through Jamaica, and the new &s;ettled acqui|&s;itions. They may feel a di&s;tre&s;s ju&s;t &s;hort of de&s;truction, but mu&s;t divert for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence &s;o much labour, as in proportion will &s;horten their rich product. In fact, why &s;hould they rai&s;e the latter, if lumber &s;hould be wanting for its package to Great-Britain. How vague, how uncertain, how nearly impracticable would be a &s;upply of the&s;e nece&s;&s;aries through any new channel, I need not repeat; but &s;hall clo&s;e this head with another &s;hort general &s;tate in confirmation of Mr. Walker's mo&s;t accurate detail. The gro&s;s amount of im|ports at an annual medium from the&s;e now unfortunate i&s;lands exceeds four millions: 190,000 ca&s;ks of &s;ugar and rum, be&s;ides many other articles, the bulky loading for &s;uch a multitude of ve&s;&s;els, more than au|thori&s;e

In the purcha&s;e of 1,300,000l. in our exports direct, and the large&s;t part of 700,000l. more in circuition through Africa for a con&s;tant &s;upply of negroes. What is left, con&s;iderable, as it may be among re&s;i|dents here, is applied to home-con&s;umption, not with a &s;paring hand, and to inve&s;tments, upholding the price of land, and the credit of public funds. At the &s;ame time they are furni&s;hing commodities to us of &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary u&s;e, which el&s;e mu&s;t be paid for to foreigners, and with a &s;uperfluity for foreign con&s;ump|tion likewi&s;e.

Nor will I take North-America for a companion in my pre&s;ent melancholy walk, becau&s;e &s;he may prove the only gainer, and as a community become more &s;ound and healthy, while every other member of the empire lies bleeding. But my heart bleeds,

when, renewing my gloomy progre&s;s, I turn a view towards one kingdom, a great mem|ber, which may unhappily be di&s;tingui&s;hed above all &s;ufferers in the pre&s;ent conjuncture; I mean the kingdom of Scotland: and among my honourable hearers, they, who&s;e particular attention, I may now engage, have no cau&s;e to doubt the &s;incerity of my feelings. I have taken equal pains with the accounts of exports from that kingdom, as from this. The papers, I could collect, begin at Chri&s;t|mas 1748, and end at Chri&s;tmas 1772, with two years wanting, a circum&s;tance however, which will not in the lea&s;t impede me in illu&s;trating the progre&s;s and improvement of the North Briti&s;h trade. A fir&s;t period &s;hews an annual medium of about 500,000l. In a &s;econd it ri&s;es to 860,000l. In a third to 1,150,000l. and in the la&s;t for 1770, 1771 and 1772 to 1,700,000l. of which about 400,000l. is colony-export exclu&s;ive of Ireland, and the far greater part to the tobacco provinces: where many of my mo&s;t worthy friends have a property lying much larger, than I chu&s;e to conjecture. To this I add a known export of linen, exceeding 200,000l. &s;upplied to England for American u&s;e. The whole may be little &s;hort of 700,000l, but calling it 6, I a&s;k, if Scotland can well endure a &s;tagnation of &s;uch a value for twelve months to come. Whether their export to Ireland of 3 to 400,000l. will be affected, and how far emigration of late &s;o prevalent may be
<PB N="24" REF="23">
extended by the pre&s;&s;ure of a new calamity, I will not forbode. Sir, I feel&mdash;Sir, tho&s;e feelings forbid me to expatiate further&mdash;I chu&s;e to drop the &s;ubject. Ob&s;erving only, that the colony-export from Scotland is to their whole much in the &s;ame proportion with ours, I will now pa&s;s over to Ireland.</P>
<P>That kingdom takes from England and Scotland little &s;hort of 2,400,000l. annually in goods. How doth &s;he pay for them? A large part in linen and yarn, the remainder in ca&s;h, acquired by her foreign traffic. In the printed report to this Hou&s;e from their linen committee it appears, that in 1771 the linen made, and brought to market for &s;ale in that kingdom for its own u&s;e and ours, amounted to 2,150,000l. and the yarn exported to about 200,000l. This immen&s;e value, the employment of &s;uch numbers, hath its &s;ource in North-America. The flax&s;eed from thence not worth 40,000l. a trifle to that continent, forms the ba&s;is of Ireland, and reverts largely in manufacture from her to the original &s;eat of growth. In reply, what is the cry of my magnanimous countrymen without doors? Dignity! Supremacy! The evil hour is advancing, not yet come; no &s;ooner come, than felt, it may produce a di&s;covery too late, that high-&s;ounding words imply no food to the hungry, no raiment to the naked; and that the&s;e throughout our empire may amount to millions in number&mdash;But new channels of &s;upply &s;hall be found; our potency can

&s;urmount all difficulties. It is full time to begin the e&s;&s;ay in Ireland, le&s;t, during the experiment, emigration &s;o con&s;tant there &s;hould change to depopulation in the Prote&s;|tant quarters.</P>
<P>I now return to England, not a member, but the head. Her &s;orrows I will leave to the contemplation of that &s;uperior cla&s;s, which mu&s;t be the ultimate and permanent &s;ufferer. The &s;age Mr. Locke would tell the country gentleman, that his vi&s;ible pro|perty mu&s;t re-place the lo&s;s of public revenue; that he mu&s;t provide for a nation of hungry and naked, or &s;ink into utter debility and de&s;pondency; when the &s;un ri&s;es no more on this once flouri&s;hing i&s;land, but to &s;ee the de&s;ertion of inhabitants, and a wretched remnant, wandering unclad and unfed in lamentation over a wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P>I have mentioned the revenue, and &s;hall now be very conci&s;e upon that head. De|ducting bounties and drawbacks, the neat receipt at the Exchequer from duties and exci&s;e on We&s;t-India productions I venture to &s;et at more than 700,000l. and another receipt in the North-American branch, at ju&s;t &s;o much, as with the former may render a total of one million. To that amount the public revenue is immediately concerned. Con&s;equential lo&s;s, for in&s;tance in the great article of tea for want of the u&s;ual &s;upply of &s;ugar, or in any other articles, I do not dwell upon here, but leave to reflection.</P>

Thus far, Sir, I hope, that I have proved what was your &s;ituation, happy in receiving from your colonies all the po&s;&s;ible advantage attainable in the nature of things.

Yet, Sir, I likewi&s;e &s;incerely wi&s;h, that the gloomy a&s;pect, I have given to our future &s;ituation, may be all nugatory, all mi&s;repre|&s;entation, unintended, but not therefore le&s;s the re&s;ult of error and blindne&s;s. Hitherto I have look'd on one &s;ide of the que&s;tion only; permit me now to comtemplate the other.</P>
<P>It is the general acceptation, that the a&s;&s;o|ciated provinces will &s;ubmit in con&s;equence of the mea&s;ures taken. The mea&s;ures I al|lude to are public facts; and with &s;ome re|lief to my own dejection I apply them to in|troduce another fact inconte&s;table and bril|liant; whereon I gladly dwell for a while: it is a &s;ubject of prai&s;e, requiring but few words, becau&s;e it is true. I have nam'd the Romans; we have among us a &s;elect body, whom I compare with them, as their equals at any the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h'd epoch of their martial &s;cience and prowe&s;s. I will not hazard a pa|negyric. The grateful &s;en&s;ations of all our memories retain the illu&s;trious and recent atchievements of the Briti&s;h military by land and &s;ea, with a warmth, which would render the mo&s;t elaborate encomium &s;piritle&s;s and cold. But them&s;elves, letter'd gentlemen of England, and vers'd in hi&s;tory, will allow, that the peculiar &s;uperiority, deriv'd from di&s;cipline, po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by them in its highe&s;t excellence, is but the effect of human art; that there are left at large in human nature certain &s;parks, who&s;e occa&s;ional concurrence produces operations not to be circum&s;crib'd,

or controul'd by art or power, and hath caus'd &s;uch wonderful vici&s;&s;itudes, recorded in times pa&s;t, but, I hope, will make no part of our future annals. I allude to that violent agitation of the &s;oul, enthu&s;ia&s;m. Such vi|ci&s;&s;itudes, not to be &s;hunn'd by art or power, merit the mo&s;t attention, when mo&s;t is &s;et upon a ca&s;t.</P>
<P>Many without doors have treated the ex|i&s;tence of this uncontrollable &s;pirit as ima|ginary. I did not rea&s;on with tho&s;e, who either feel no enthu&s;ia&s;m for any thing &s;eri|ous, or retain ju&s;t &s;o much, as may be requi|&s;ite in the eager pur&s;uit of diver&s;ions, plea|&s;ures, or profit. I would have accompanied others more &s;peculative through their &s;everal gradations of hope, &s;till di&s;appointed, and &s;till reviving, but for one ob&s;ervation, which I have generally kept conceal'd, but will &s;oon reveal to you. But for this ob&s;ervation I might have concurr'd with the public belief, that the capital of a province, now declared in rebellion, would have &s;ubmitted on the landing of a few regiments; this failing, that other provinces from ancient jealou&s;y and di&s;gu&s;t would not have interfer'd, rather &s;ought their own advantage out of that town's di&s;tre&s;s; this failing, that they never would have proceeded to the length of con&s;tituting a certain inau&s;picious a&s;&s;embly among them|&s;elves; this failing, that the members of &s;uch a&s;&s;embly would have di&s;agreed, and not fram'd a &s;ingle re&s;olution. This la&s;t hope
<PB N="29" REF="28">
having prov'd abortive, a new one is popu|larly adopted, that the fir&s;t intelligence of enforcing mea&s;ures, at lea&s;t the bare com|mencement of their execution will tame the mo&s;t refractory &s;pirits. I will here &s;tate the grounds of this, and all the preceding hopes; afterwards with your indulgence the ground of my original and continued doubts.</P>
<P>Our trading nation naturally a&s;&s;um'd, that the pre&s;ent contention would be with traders in America. The &s;tock of a trader, whether his own, or in part, and often the greate&s;t part a property of others, confiding in him, is per&s;onal, lodg'd in a magazine, and ex|pos'd in &s;ea&s;ons of commotion to in&s;tanta|neous deva&s;tation. The circum&s;tance of &s;uch property, the con&s;iderations, &s;ugge&s;ted by common prudence, by the &s;en&s;e of com|mon ju&s;tice to tho&s;e, who have given a ge|nerous credit, rarely make room for that in|trepidity, which meets force with force. Hence I admit, that the mere traffickers would have &s;ubmitted at fir&s;t, and will now whenever they dare. The rea&s;on, why they have not dared, is the foundation of my doubts.</P>
<P>I am &s;peaking to an enlighten'd a&s;&s;embly, and conver&s;ant with their own annals. In tho&s;e ages, the rever&s;e of commercial, when your ance&s;tors fill'd the ranks of men at arms, and compos'd the cavalry of England, of whom did the infantry con&s;i&s;t? A race unknown to other kingdoms, and in the
<PB N="30" REF="29">
pre&s;ent opulence of traffic almo&s;t extinct in this, the yeomenry of England; an order of men, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing paternal inheritance, culti|vated under their own care, enough to pre|&s;erve independence, and cheri&s;h the generous &s;entiments attendant on that condition, with|out &s;uperfluity for idlene&s;s, or effeminate in|dulgence. Of &s;uch doth North America con&s;i&s;t. The race is reviv'd there in greater numbers, and in a greater proportion to the re&s;t of the inhabitants; and in &s;uch the power of that continent re&s;ides. The&s;e keep the traffickers in awe. The&s;e, many hun|dred thou&s;ands in multitude, with enthu&s;i|a&s;m in their hearts, with the petition, the bill of rights, and the acts of &s;ettlement, &s;ilent and ob&s;olete in &s;ome places, but vociferous and fre&s;h, as newly born, among them; the&s;e hot with the blood of their progenitors, the enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;courges at one period, and the revolutional expellers of tyranny at ano|ther; the&s;e, unpractis'd <HI>in frivolous di&s;&s;ipati|on, and ruinous profu&s;ion,</HI> &s;tanding arm'd on the &s;pot, deliver'd down from their fathers, a property not moveable, nor expos'd to total de&s;truction, therefore maintainable, and ex|citing all the &s;pirit and vigour of defence; the&s;e under &s;uch circum&s;tances of number, animation and manners, their lawyers and clergy blowing the trumpet, are we to en|counter with a handful of men, &s;ent three thou&s;and miles over the ocean to &s;eek &s;uch

<P>That exports to the a&s;&s;ociated provinces have cea&s;ed for months is a fact. May not their non importation agreement &s;ingly be a weapon &s;ufficiently effectual in their hands without &s;triking a blow? Why &s;trike with|out occa&s;ion?</P>
<P>To over&s;et this &s;ugge&s;tion an a&s;&s;ertion is brought, that nece&s;&s;ity will break the com|bination. I take this fre&s;h ground to &s;hew, that nece&s;&s;ity in conjunction with enthu&s;ia&s;m may produce a directly oppo&s;ite effect. I throw but a tran&s;ient glance on the extra|ordinary &s;tock of goods, laid in by the co|loni&s;ts la&s;t year, though &s;aid to be &s;ufficient for the con&s;umption of two. The arguments I &s;hall u&s;e, carry their own evidence with them. Let the population in the a&s;&s;ociated provinces be three millions, as delivered into the Congre&s;s, or be reduced to two and a half white and black. At a moderate com|putation per head the quantity of goods, including all u&s;es be&s;ides apparel, is not
<PB N="32" REF="31">
adequate to half their con&s;umption, which I &s;tated before to the amount of three milli|ons &s;terling, without &s;eparating &s;ome con&s;i|derable articles for the month. This annual &s;upply they never did annually pay for, but always remain'd under a heavy debt to the mother country, a capital advantage to her, as &s;hall be explain'd in its place. How is the other half of their con&s;umption, un&s;upplied from hence, provided with the &s;everal arti|cles for cloathing and other nece&s;&s;aries? What is introduc'd through illicit trade with the foreigner mu&s;t be paid for in ready mo|ney, and is chiefly for the rich and the few. How is the multitude &s;upplied, di&s;pers'd over that va&s;t continent, and at con&s;iderable di&s;tances from the &s;ea? Sir, by the &s;ame means, and nece&s;&s;arily &s;o, as are practis'd in mo&s;t counties of the&s;e kingdoms. There are two kinds of manufacture; one active and &s;y&s;tematic, collected under a &s;uperin|tendace, and brought to the markets of &s;ale. The other is &s;edentary and dome&s;tic, ob&s;cure but large, could the &s;mall and &s;cattered par|cels be gathered up for computation, as may be made of the former from the records of public marts. The latter lies among the wives and children of rural, of ru&s;tic fami|lies; is applied to dome&s;tic u&s;e, and rarely &s;ees a market for &s;ale. In the &s;ame mode the American yeomenry are furni&s;hed among them&s;elves. The dome&s;tic manufacture mu&s;t in cour&s;e be large for the u&s;e of &s;uch numbers;
<PB N="33" REF="32">
the active for &s;ale is far from maturity among them: but nece&s;&s;ity, urg'd again&s;t them, may extend the arts and materials, already indu|bitably po&s;&s;e&s;s'd; and enthu&s;ia&s;m may &s;tamp on their home-&s;pun all the value, all the pride of ornament.</P>
<P>Sir, I fore&s;ee, the&s;e differences with Ame|rica will be compos'd, and how&mdash;There &s;ilence becomes me be&s;t&mdash;It will be &s;o late, that Great-Britain mu&s;t receive a wound, which no time can heal&mdash;A philo&s;ophical &s;en&s;e of dignity mu&s;t &s;tep in under the &s;hape of con&s;olation.</P>
<P>This reflection I wi&s;h to obviate, and will &s;tate a &s;trong que&s;tion from the other &s;ide. Admitting, if I plea&s;e, the practicability of the coloni&s;t &s;upplying his wants with his own homely manufacture, improveable too by time and experience; yet will not an inter|ruption to the vent of his own produce, and to the profits of his trade, be a lo&s;s of &s;uch magnitude, as may quickly, and with an intermediate &s;tagnation too &s;hort for us &s;en|&s;ibly to feel, reduce his mind to a &s;tate of humiliation? The interruption, I allow, will be a lo&s;s to individuals, large to &s;ome, &s;mall to many, and operate in degrees proporti|onate to &s;ituations and tempers. The trad|ing cla&s;s fore&s;ee it already, and are humbled enough to &s;ubmit, if they could.

<P>Sir, you have repeatedly heard before this day of the large debt from the coloni&s;ts to our merchants; an uncontrovertible truth to the permanent amount of millions. Griev'd, as humanity mu&s;t be, at any occurence, which puts &s;uch a property, and &s;o many

meritorious &s;ubjects in peril, or even under a temporary anxiety; yet &s;uch being the cour&s;e of that trade, the effect of a voluntary conduct, public policy hath cau&s;e to rejoice, at the &s;ame time to acknowledge a high, though un&s;ought obligation to the merchant, who by this practice holds in his hand the principal bond of colony dependence, enforces the act of navigation, and becomes in the public behalf the true guardian of that half divine law, the work of penetration and wi&s;dom equal to the great men, who fram'd it. Illicit traffic is common to all regions and governments, nor to be avoided in any, but by a &s;trict care not to lead into temptation. Upon the whole, no commercial regulation hath been more accurately ob&s;erved, than the act of navigation, to which the American Congre&s;s mo&s;t intelligibly &s;ubmits, and which in their deprivation of capital privileges and liberties, enjoyed by their fellow-&s;ubjects here, comprehends their contribution for protection; an act, which hath generally been well obeyed by them, and the merchant at home hath made it their intere&s;t. A foreign corre&s;pondent might account mo&s;t ju&s;tly for the neat proceeds of tobacco, rice, &s;ugar, &amp;c. but will not give credit for a &s;tiver more; and for that rea&s;on doth not receive &s;uch con&s;ignments even from the le&s;s &s;crupulous ob&s;ervers of the law. The Briti&s;h merchant on a hundred pound, neated from a con|&s;ignment, readily &s;upplies the American's
<PB N="36" REF="35">
wants for a hundred and twenty, thirty, how far is immaterial. This accommodation he hath not, and through long habit doth not try to have from any quarter out of Great-Britain, and therefore chu&s;es to &s;end his produce through her channel; nor will a few exceptions invalidate the argument: and till the awful volume of earthly vici&s;&s;i|tudes &s;hall di&s;clo&s;e the fatal page, where that Omnipotent Hand, which hath lifted up and ca&s;t down the proude&s;t dominion of old, may have written the de&s;ignation of empire to the child; till then the merchant of Great-Britain will keep the child in all po&s;&s;ible dependence on the parent.</P>
<P>Sir, after all, though my fellow &s;ubjects ri&s;e more and more in the flattering confi|dence, that the colonies will not adhere to their agreements, I do not commit my&s;elf in a&s;&s;erting the contrary; I do not pronounce, that they will: I only &s;ugge&s;t, that they may; and on that &s;uppo&s;ition have attempted to &s;hew, what England, Scotland and Ireland &s;take on the conte&s;t; nothing le&s;s, than a long-approved and &s;ucce&s;sful &s;y&s;tem, em|bracing every circum&s;tance of national &s;ta|bility, pro&s;perity and lu&s;tre. For what this is put in hazard, I humbly hope, is a que&s;tion too &s;erious for ca&s;ui&s;try; and, I humbly believe, &s;olely to be mea&s;ured by expediency and practicability under the direction of that great council, which holds the guardian&s;hip
<PB N="37" REF="36">
of three kingdoms, and their boundle&s;s de|pendencies.</P>
<P>Right, authority, &s;overeignty, dignity, &s;upremacy are admitted to the utmo&s;t extent of their ground. Is there not another ground antecedent and original, that from the nature of mankind, there never was, nor is, and never will be a community, who after the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of benefits, delivered down from father to &s;on for more than a century, will be per&s;uaded to relinqui&s;h &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by any plea of law and right, urg'd with all the eloquence of advocates? A force &s;upe|rior to argument is requi&s;ite, which brings the que&s;tion back to expediency and practi|cability.</P>
<P>Conceive not, Sir, that our very thoughts have pre&s;umed to interfere with the coun&s;els or determinations of the &s;tate; but as the pre&s;ent &s;ubject of deliberation and mea&s;ures is too pregnant with events not to run far into the future, we &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively hope, that the facts, we have produced, and the deductions from them, if not in the pre&s;ent hour, may prove of &s;ome utility hereafter.</P>
<P>You in your future deliberations will &s;e|parate the frivolous from the important, the &s;pecious and the plau&s;ible from the &s;ound and the true. You, &s;earching the depths of human nature, will not be mi&s;led by trite and popular opinion; and, when the force of &s;elf-intere&s;t is alledged at this momentous cri&s;is, you will di&s;cover, that intere&s;t is not
<PB N="38" REF="37">
the predominant ruler of mankind&mdash;I repeat, that intere&s;t is not the predominant ruler of mankind. The few indeed are under that frigid influence; but the many are governed by pa&s;&s;ion, who&s;e train I need not arrange. Per&s;everance in acts of violence from one quarter, and per&s;everance in another to &s;uffer, may be in both the re&s;ult of pa&s;&s;ion. Pa&s;&s;ion can mi&s;interpret words, give &s;olidity to empty &s;ounds, and convert &s;hadow to &s;ub&s;tance. Pa&s;&s;ion could give weight to the cry of the church, when Sacheverell infatuated a nation, renowned above all others for &s;olid &s;en&s;e, and depth of thought.</P>
<P>To conclude: if, Sir, in any future ope|ration this honourable Hou&s;e may conde&s;cend to a moment's remembrance of us, our ap|pearance may prove not altogether in vain. Although there is &s;till much remaining to offer, permit us now to withdraw, unreproved, we hope, by you; but &s;urely &s;o by our own con&s;cientious feelings in thus attempting our di&s;charge of a duty to the public&mdash;Over the acts already pa&s;&s;ed and pa&s;&s;ing, I do not breathe out a word&mdash;only a parting &s;igh.</P>

<P>THE Hou&s;e in Committee on the We&s;t India planters petition; which was pre&s;ented on the 2d of February la&s;t, by Mr. Alderman Oliver; who &s;aid, the petitioners reque&s;ted that they might be allowed to bring evidence in &s;upport of their petition.</P>
<P>Mr. Glover appeared as agent for the pe|titioners, and manager of the evidence, in &s;upport of the petition.</P>
<P><HI>George Walker,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> called in.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;tion.</HI> What is your &s;ituation?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> I am of Barbadoes; re&s;ided there a great many years, and have been their agent ever &s;ince I left the country.</P>
<P>Q. Plea&s;e to inform the Committee, what you know in relation to the &s;tate of Barba|does, the Leeward I&s;lands, and the re&s;t of the &s;ugar colonies?</P>
<P>A. My &s;ituation having been &s;uch, as to afford me the means, I may be pre&s;umed to know &s;omething of the &s;tate of Barbadoes, of the i&s;lands in its neighbourhood, and of the &s;ugar colonies in general. Barbadoes, and all the &s;ugar i&s;lands, are to be con&s;idered as countries, in which a great manufacture is e&s;tabli&s;hed. It is a manufacture of &s;ugar
<PB N="40" REF="39">
and rum. In&s;tead of being able to purcha&s;e at market the raw materials for the manu|facture, they are obliged to produce the raw materials from their own &s;oil. They ingraft the farmer upon the manufacturer; not (in the intention of furni&s;hing the workmen with food, but) from the nece&s;&s;ity of grow|ing the raw material. Thus the land and labour of the country being devoted to the cultivation of the &s;ugar-cane, the corn and provi&s;ions they rai&s;e are merely accidental; they are no more than can be rai&s;ed without prejudice to the &s;ugar-cane. To the &s;ugar|cane every thing is &s;acrificed, as a trifle to the principle object. In Barbadoes, I doubt whether the corn, (it is Indian corn not wheat) and the ground provi&s;ions (I mean yams, and other roots) rai&s;ed in the i&s;land, are &s;ufficient to maintain the inhabi|tants for three months; I am certain they will not maintain them for four months, un|le&s;s the four months be tho&s;e in the begin|ning of the year, in the &s;ea&s;on for ground provi&s;ions. The Indian corn and ground provi&s;ions cannot, by common means, be pre&s;erved for any length of time. I ought to add the uncertainty of the native products, e&s;pecially of Indian corn and ground provi|&s;ions: dry weather, or exce&s;s of wet weather, hurricanes, bla&s;ts, vermine, frequently dimi|ni&s;h or de&s;troy the hopes of the planter. The la&s;t year exhibited a melancholy exam|ple in Barbadoes, many families having been
<PB N="41" REF="40">
&s;upported by public contributions. Nor is the &s;oil in every plantation capable of pro|ducing corn, although very proper for the &s;ugar-cane. As to the Leeward I&s;lands, they produce neither corn nor ground provi&s;ions worth mentioning, except Tortola. Tortola was a cotton colony; cotton and corn are not incon&s;i&s;tent. Tortola began to make &s;ugar within my remembrance; and there is rea&s;on to believe, the whole country is not yet en|gro&s;&s;ed by &s;ugar-cane. From this view of the &s;ugar colony, in the light of a manufac|ture, where the &s;oil, as well as the labour, is employed in the manufacture, it follows, that &s;uch colonies mu&s;t depend, in proportion to the exten&s;ivene&s;s of the manufacture, upon other places for nece&s;&s;ary food, for actual &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The ob&s;ervation applies to Ja|maica, and to the i&s;lands under the Granada government.</P>
<P>Q. From what places do the &s;ugar colo|nies draw food for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence?</P>
<P>A. They are not many; Great-Britain, Ireland, North-America. From Great-Bri|tain, the &s;ugar colonies receive a little &s;alted fi&s;h, pilchards from the we&s;t, herrings from the North. As to corn, they receive no wheat in grain, and a mere trifle in flour. The flour, during the three years, from 1771 to 1773, may be &s;hewn to have been under four quarters, upon the whole to all the We&s;t Indies. It may be &s;hewn that the beans and peas together, do not exceed thirteen
<PB N="42" REF="41">
thou&s;and quarters, nor the oats nineteen thou&s;and; and even this importation, &s;mall as it is, is owing to a particular circum|&s;tance: it is, that the Indian corn of North-America, the great &s;upply of the We&s;t In|dies, &s;oon peri&s;hes in a hot and moi&s;t climate; and as the trade is carried on from different provinces, it is unconnected, unconcerted, dependent upon the opportunities, upon the caprices of individuals; dependent upon accidents of winds and weather: it is, there|fore, in its nature irregular. A fortuitious combination, &s;ometimes increa&s;es the irre|gularity to &s;uch a degree, as to reduce a par|ticular colony to a real, though temporary di&s;tre&s;s. Beans, peas, and oats, being capa|ble of a longer re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t putrefaction, than the Indian corn from North America, the &s;ugar colonies, e&s;pecially the Leeward i&s;lands, who have the fewe&s;t internal re&s;ources, do therefore make &s;ome provi&s;ion in the&s;e articles again&s;t that temporary di&s;tre&s;s; &s;o delicately &s;trained already is the &s;tring, which is now threatened with rough and unremit|ting violence. I purpo&s;ely forbear other arti|cles of food from Great-Britain, intended for the u&s;e of people of &s;ome condition, hams, chee&s;e, and the like; they belong properly to the general commerce of Great-Britain with the We&s;t Indies. I confine my&s;elf at pre&s;ent to nece&s;&s;ary food. Ireland furni&s;hes a large quantity of &s;alted beef, pork, butter, and herrings, but no grain.
<PB N="43" REF="42">
North America &s;upplies all the re&s;t, both cornand provi&s;ions. North America is truly the granary of the We&s;t Indies; from thence they draw the great quantities of flour and bi&s;cuit, for the u&s;e of one cla&s;s of people, and of Indian corn for the &s;upport of all the others; for the &s;upport not of man only, but of every animal for the u&s;e of man, hor&s;es, &s;wine, &s;heep, poultry. North Ame|rica al&s;o furni&s;hes the We&s;t Indies with rice. Rice, a more expen&s;ive diet, and le&s;s capable of &s;u&s;taining the body under hard labour, is of a more limited con&s;umption, but is a nece&s;&s;ary indulgence for the young, the &s;ick, the weakly, among&s;t the common people and the negroes. North America not only furni&s;hes the We&s;t Indies with bread, but with meat, with &s;heep, poultry, and &s;ome live cattle; but the demand for the&s;e is infi|nitely &s;hort of the demand for the &s;alted beef, pork, and fi&s;h. Salted fi&s;h (if the expre&s;&s;ion may be permitted in contra&s;t with bread) is the meat of all the lower ranks of people in Barbadoes, and the Leeward I&s;lands. It is the meat of all the &s;laves in all the We&s;t Indies. Nor is it di&s;dained by per&s;ons of better condition. The North American na|vigation al&s;o furni&s;hes the &s;ugar colonies with &s;alt from Turk's I&s;lands, Sal Tortuga and Anguilla; although the&s;e i&s;lands are them|&s;elves a part of the We&s;t Indies. The te&s;ti|mony which &s;ome experience has enabled me to bear, you will find confirmed, Sir, by
<PB N="44" REF="43">
official accounts. The &s;ame accounts will di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;ource of the principal, the great &s;upply of corn and provi&s;ions. They will fix it preci&s;ely in the middle colonies of North America: in tho&s;e colonies, who have made a publick agreement in their congre&s;s, to withold all their &s;upplies after the tenth of next September. How far that agreement may be precipitated in its execution, may be retarded, or fru&s;trated, it is for the wi&s;dom of parliament to con&s;ider: but if it is per|&s;i&s;ted in, I am well founded to &s;ay, that no|thing will &s;ave Barbadoes and the Leeward I&s;lands from the dreadful con&s;equences of ab|&s;olute famine. I repeat the famine will not be prevented. The di&s;tre&s;s will fall upon them &s;uddenly; they will be overwhelmed with it, before they can turn them&s;elves about to look out for relief. What a &s;cene! when rapine &s;timulated by hunger has broken down all fences, conf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">unded the rich with the poor, and levelled the freeman with his &s;lave! The di&s;tre&s;s will be &s;udden. The body of the people do not look forward to di&s;tant events; if they &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">uld to this, they will put their tru&s;t in the wi&s;dom of parliament. Suppo&s;e them to be le&s;s confident in the wi&s;dom of parlia|ment, they are de&s;titute of the means of purcha&s;ing an extraordinary &s;tock. Suppo&s;e them po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the means; a very extra|ordinary &s;tock is not to be found at market. There is a plain rea&s;on in the nature of the thing, which prevents any extraordinary &s;tock
<PB N="45" REF="44">
at market, and which would forbid the planter from laying it in, if there was: it is, that the objects of it are peri&s;hable. In tho&s;e climates the flour will not keep above &s;ix or eight weeks; the Indian corn decays in three months; and all the North American provi|&s;ions are fit only for pre&s;ent u&s;e.</P>
<P>Q. If the We&s;t Indies are deprived of their u&s;ual &s;upplies of corn and provi&s;ions from the middle colonies of North America, are there no re&s;ources by which the deficiency may be made good?</P>
<P>A. I will examine the re&s;ources I have heard mentioned. Great-Britain cannot in|crea&s;e her exportation of corn and provi&s;ions to the We&s;t Indies; for &s;he would increa&s;e a &s;carcity at home already complained of: notwith&s;tanding the a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;he largely re|ceives her&s;elf; particularly in wheat and flour from North America. Ireland has other markets to furni&s;h be&s;ides the We&s;t Indies; the&s;e markets will not &s;uffer them&s;elves to be deprived of their u&s;ual &s;hare, beyond a cer|tain limitted degree; a degree too limitted to &s;upply the whole We&s;t India con&s;umption. The colonies at the &s;outhern extremity of America, the two Floridas, are not able to feed them&s;elves; and Georgia, a &s;mall coun|try, is &s;aid to have acceded to the congre&s;s. At the northern extremity, St. John's is in its infancy. From Nova Scotia, the We&s;t In|dies receive &s;ome &s;mall &s;upplies. As to the &s;alted fi&s;h from Newfoundland, it is fi&s;h from
<PB N="46" REF="45">
New England; it is taken upon the banks by the New England people chiefly; who are to have none to &s;end us, unle&s;s the fi&s;hery bill &s;hould operate a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, or have no operation at all. Canada, Sir, produces not Indian corn. In the hands of Great-Britain, and under Engli&s;h laws, it has exported wheat; <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Eighty thou&s;and quarters.</HI> This &s;entence is not in the evidence.</NOTE> but the quantity is neither equal to the demand of the We&s;t Indies; nor is it prepared for the We&s;t India market; but all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e are expedients for a di&s;tant day. In future times from all the&s;e countries, accord|ing to their &s;everal natures, a con&s;tant and regular demand will create a con&s;tant and regular &s;upply. It is impo&s;&s;ible; it is in|con&s;i&s;tent with the nature of commerce, to furni&s;h an adequate &s;upply to a va&s;t, an im|mediate, and an unexpected demand; the demand and the &s;upply mu&s;t grow up toge|ther, mutually &s;upporting and &s;upported by each other. One more expedient remains; it is di&s;tant like the re&s;t: it will be effectual, but it will be ruinous; it is to change our &s;y&s;tem. We mu&s;t abandon the manufacture, and apply the land and labour now appro|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">iated to the manufacture to the purpo&s;es of rai&s;ing food. The undone remnant of the people, who &s;hall not have fallen victims to the intermediate famine may thus provide again&s;t it for the time to come. I flatter my&s;elf, Sir, I have &s;hewn from a deduction
<PB N="47" REF="46">
of facts the dependence of Barbadoes and the Leeward I&s;lands upon North America for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. I leave it to gentlemen of more intimate knowledge of the &s;tate of Ja|maica, than I can pretend to, to &s;hew that a relation of the &s;ame kind, and if not to the &s;ame extent, yet far beyond the common opinion, &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between that great i&s;land, and the northern continent. As to Granada and its dependencies, Sir, let me only ob|&s;erve, that the manufacture of &s;ugar and rum, and the cultivation of coffee in tho&s;e i&s;lands, having been pro&s;ecuted with unremitting ar|dour, little of their labour can have been di|verted to the rai&s;ing of corn and provi&s;ions. Their dependence upon North America was rea&s;onable; and I may venture to conclude it to be &s;imilar to that of their neighbours. I have been the more explicit upon this &s;ub|ject, the dependence of the We&s;t Indies upon North America for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, as it is the calamity which pre&s;&s;es immediately, affecting life as well as fortune; it is a di&s;tre&s;s which your humanity will con&s;pire with your intere&s;t to prevent; and I tru&s;t that the wi&s;dom of parliament will find the means.</P>
<P>Q. What is the commodity called lum|ber? For what purpo&s;e u&s;ed, and whence procured?</P>
<P>A. In the We&s;t Indies, they under&s;tood by the term lumber every &s;pecies of North American wood, when prepared for the u&s;e of buildings or the cooperage. It includes
<PB N="48" REF="47">
the deal, the pine, the cypre&s;s, the cedar, the white oak, the red oak, and others; and comes in the &s;hape of beams, joi&s;ts, planks, boards, &s;hingles, &s;taves, and in logs. Build|ings where great &s;trength is required, and which are expo&s;ed to wind and weather, de|mand timber of a texture more &s;olid, and of a quality le&s;s &s;ubject to decay in tho&s;e cli|mates; it is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of hard wood; mahogany is of that tribe. Such, as far as my experience extends, grow only between the tropicks; the price is high, three and four &s;hillings &s;terling the cubick foot; employed from the call of nece&s;&s;ity, the com&s;umption is limited. For every other purpo&s;e of the carpenter and of the cooper, it is the lumber of North America that is u&s;ed. It is a plea&s;ure to me, Sir, to &s;pare the patience of the committee a detail of con|jectural calculations. I under&s;tand that there is &s;ome official paper which will inform you preci&s;ely. The part which is furni&s;hed by the middle colonies of North America is out of all proportion to the others. Without lumber to repair the buildings they run im|mediately to decay. And without lumber for the proper packages for &s;ugar, and to contain rum, they cannot be &s;old at market, they cannot even be kept at home.</P>
<P>Q. Are there not places, be&s;ides the mid|dle colonies of North America, from whence may be drawn a &s;upply of lumber, in &s;ome
<PB N="49" REF="48">
degree proportionate to the wants of the We&s;t Indies?</P>
<P>A. I will examine. The fir&s;t re&s;ource may be in the colony it&s;elf: but Barbadoes and the Leeward I&s;lands are altogether de&s;ti|tute of wood. The gentlemen of Jamaica will inform you how unequal their country is to its own demands. Remains the govern|ment of Granada. And here I beg leave to &s;tate a fact. Ready-made hou&s;es of North American lumber have been exported from Barbadoes to the i&s;lands under the govern|ment of Granada. The&s;e i&s;lands have plenty of wood; and this wood is of a more dura|ble nature than lumber: but an anxiety for the &s;taple manufacture &s;uper&s;eded this con&s;i|deration; and the labour of the &s;laves in&s;tead of being turned to the providing of materials for the carpenter, was re&s;erved for the cul|tivation of the &s;ugar cane.</P>
<P>Although the &s;ugar colonies may find no re&s;ources from their &s;oil, they may find it in their market at home. Lumber is a com|modity not &s;o peri&s;hable as corn and provi|&s;ions. A &s;tock of it might be laid in. This certainly is an expedient. It will be attempted by the provident and the wealthy;&mdash;the combined de&s;cription includes not a multi|tude in any country,&mdash;and the attempt will greatly enhance the price. But it is practi|cable only to a certain point. It mu&s;t be confined to the quantity at market. If an unu&s;ual quantity &s;hould be imported, as is
<PB N="50" REF="49">
probable, &s;uppo&s;ing no &s;ini&s;ter events to pro|hibit, the planter has no fund to pay for it. I &s;peak of the great body of planters in ge|neral. They are not able to provide for the expences of two or more crops out of the profits of one crop. It is well if every crop can bear up again&s;t its own particular load. Sufficient to the day is the evil thereof. Be|fore I proceed to external re&s;ources, I beg leave, Sir, to repeat what I have &s;aid before, upon the &s;ubject of a new channel for the &s;upply of corn and provi&s;ions. I &s;aid it was incon&s;i&s;tent with the nature of commerce to furni&s;h an adequate &s;upply to a va&s;t, an un|expected, and an immediate demand: that the demand and the &s;upply mu&s;t grow up together, mutually &s;upporting and &s;upported by each other. This principle de&s;troys the pro&s;pect of a timely and effectual a&s;&s;i&s;tance from any quarter what&s;oever. Not content with the operation of the general principle, I will examine the particular re&s;ources. I will only &s;ay of the two Floridas, that the population is feeble in the extreme. Georgia &s;ends &s;ome lumber; but Georgia is &s;aid to have acceded to the congre&s;s. What has been &s;aid of the Floridas, with re&s;pect to population, is applicable to St. John's, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure to Nova Scotia. Nor does Nova Scotia export any materials proper for ca&s;ks to contain rum. In Canada the popu|lation is not adequate to the new enterprize, without neglecting points of greater impor|tance
<PB N="51" REF="50">
in their &s;y&s;tem. I &s;ay of greater im|portance. Becau&s;e the We&s;t India market is now open to them; an exchange of We&s;t India commodities is de&s;irable; and not|with&s;tanding, Canada exports not lumber to the We&s;t Indies. In truth, there is a ma&s;s of objections, which nothing but a length of time can overcome. Supported by large capitals, or long credit, Canada mu&s;t fir&s;t combine &s;everal commercial objects, &s;o as to furni&s;h an a&s;&s;ortment of cargoes. They mu&s;t have proper artificers, as well as people. They mu&s;t provide a navigation equal to the bulky commodity, equal to it under the accumu|lated difficulties of a great di&s;tance, and the dangers and delays of a river covered or choaked with ice for more than half the year. If there is little or no re&s;ource to be found in America, let the We&s;t Indies, in &s;earch of lumber, turn their eyes to Europe. I pa&s;s over Great-Britain and Ireland, becau&s;e they both import va&s;t quantities of lumber. No incon&s;iderable part of it is drawn from the middle colonies of North America. But it is to be found in Europe, of every &s;ort and in every &s;hape. The demand of the We&s;t Indies has been &s;hewn to be va&s;t. It will be immediate. The tenth of September is ad|vancing very fa&s;t, and the demand will be unexpected; unexpected, in the opinion of every per&s;on who hopes that lenient mea&s;ures may be adopted; unexpected, in the opinion of every per&s;on who, without rea&s;oning far|ther,

depends upon the wi&s;dom of parliament, to extricate the We&s;t Indies, and in them the whole empire, from danger. A dome&s;tic event, unexpected in Great-Britain, will not be pre|&s;umed in foreign countries. Nor Germany, nor Norway, nor the Baltick, will ri&s;k an exten&s;ive operation in commerce, upon the &s;peculative idea of a continuance of a mo&s;t unnatural quarrel. I will however &s;uppo&s;e for a moment, that Germany provides a more plentiful &s;tock of &s;taves; that Norway and the Baltick pay the like attention to their deals. I pray it may be under&s;tood that the freight of bulky goods trenches deeply into their value. The freight of lumber from North America to the We&s;t Indies, a &s;hort &s;afe pa&s;|&s;age, is a moiety of the goods &s;hipped. The double voyage, fir&s;t to Great-Britain, and then to the We&s;t Indies, takes away at the &s;ame rate for di&s;tant and hazardous voyages, an half of that moiety, leaving only a quar|ter part to the original &s;hipper. At what an enormous price then mu&s;t this lumber come to the hands of the con&s;umer? By a &s;u&s;pen|&s;ion of the acts of navigation, it may indeed be carried to the We&s;t Indies, di&s;incumbered of the intolerable burden of a double voy|age; yet add the original price, much higher than in America; add the increa&s;e in this price from the increa&s;e in the demand from Great Britain, Ireland, and the We&s;t Indies; the remedy it&s;elf is only the le&s;&s;er evil.</P>

Q. What other &s;pecies of commodities from the middle colonies are interchanged with the We&s;t Indies?</P>
<P>A. Be&s;ides the ab&s;olute dependence of the We&s;t Indies upon North America, for &s;ub|&s;i&s;tance and for lumber, there are &s;upplies le&s;s con&s;equential, but very u&s;eful, and even nece&s;&s;ary in &s;ome re&s;pect to the We&s;t Indies; which are all furni&s;hed by the confederating colonies. The articles are train-oil for many lamps in the &s;ugar-works, hor&s;es for the &s;ad|dle and for draft, tallow, leather, tobacco, pitch, tar, turpentine, iron, &s;loop and boat|timbers, and &s;ome others. As to &s;hips, I refer them to the head of the navigation created by the commerce of the We&s;t Indies.</P>
<P>Q. What commodities do the &s;ugar colo|nies give in exchange to North America?</P>
<P>A. They did give a part of all their pro|ducts in exchange: but the middle colo|nies have refu&s;ed to take mela&s;&s;es, &s;yrups, paneels, coffee, and pimento, &s;ince the fir&s;t of la&s;t December. The principal exchange is of &s;ugar and rum. The &s;ugar is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to amount to twenty-five thou&s;and hog&s;heads directly, be&s;ides fifteen thou&s;and hog&s;heads in the &s;hape of refined &s;ugar from England. As to rum, the dependence of all the i&s;lands, except Jamaica, is as great upon the middle colonies of North America for the con&s;umption of their rum, as it is for &s;ub&s;i&s;tance and for lumber. Jamaica &s;ends about eleven thou&s;and puncheons to London,
<PB N="54" REF="53">
which &s;tocks the market at the pre&s;ent price. Lower the price, the method is plain and ea&s;y, the con&s;umption increa&s;es in proportion. Nor will the revenue &s;uffer. How far the expedient may &s;ave Jamaica in this moment|ous article of their manufacture, I leave to be explained by gentlemen more intimately acquainted with that i&s;land. The rum of Barbadoes, the Leeward i&s;lands, and the government of Granada, does not come to England, except in &s;mall portions. It goes in part to Ireland; and all the re&s;t, the great quantity, is di&s;tributed chiefly among&s;t the middle colonies of North America, agree|able to the law of reciprocal exchange. The agreement of tho&s;e colonies, which is to take place the tenth of next September, extends in words, only to the witholding of all &s;up|plies. But it mu&s;t effect a total &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of commerce. They will not &s;end their ve&s;|&s;els in balla&s;t, to purcha&s;e with gold and &s;il|ver the goods they have been accu&s;tomed to receive in exchange for the products of their own &s;oil and indu&s;try. It is an idea repug|nant to every principle of commerce: it is more; it is repugnant to the &s;pirit which now inflames tho&s;e colonies. Sir, I have &s;hewn, I tru&s;t, the ab&s;olute dependence of the &s;ugar colonies upon the middle colonies of Ameri|ca, in three e&s;&s;ential points; <HI>viz.</HI> For corn and provi&s;ions for &s;ub&s;i&s;tance: for lumber and other nece&s;&s;aries for the maintenances of their plantations: and la&s;tly, for the con|&s;umption
<PB N="55" REF="54">
of their produce of all kinds, greatly of &s;ugar, but principally of rum. This doctrine of the dependence of &s;ugar colonies upon North America is confirmed by an authority, which will not be di&s;puted. The act of parliament of the &s;ixth of George the &s;econd, chapter the thirteenth, was made upon this occa&s;ion. The Briti&s;h &s;ugar-colo|nies complained of the great increa&s;e of the French &s;ugar-colonies, and demon&s;trated the increa&s;e to have been owing principally to the &s;upport which the French &s;ugar-colonies received from the middle provinces of North America, in exchange for &s;ugar and mela&s;&s;es. Perhaps it is be&s;ide my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to re|mark the manner in which the admini&s;tration of tho&s;e days adju&s;ted the great di&s;pute. Sir, they contrived to plea&s;e both &s;ides. To the i&s;lands, they gave the letter of the law; and the continent they indulged in the breach of it. The fact is all I want. It &s;hews that even the French &s;ugar-colonies do depend, in no &s;mall degree, upon North America. Nor are the Danes in the i&s;lands, nor the Dutch in the &s;outhern continent, an excep|tion. Such is the force of that principle, which con&s;iders a &s;ugar plantation, as a ma|nufactory obliged to rai&s;e its own materials. If, in the cour&s;e of events during this un|happy di&s;pute, the foreign colonies &s;hould be deprived of their re&s;ources from America, it is not my province to examine whether the di&s;tre&s;s will be looked upon with indifference:
<PB N="56" REF="55">
but it becomes me to hope, that Great-Britain will never &s;uffer her own to be ruined for want of the accu&s;tomed and acce&s;&s;ary &s;upplies from North America.</P>
<P>Q. What is the kind of property in the We&s;t India i&s;lands? And can you e&s;timate the value thereof?</P>
<P>A. The nature of the property ve&s;ted in the We&s;t Indies will appear by the e&s;timate of its value. I &s;hall calculate in &s;terling money of Great-Britain. To begin with Barbadoes. It &s;tands fir&s;t on the map. This i&s;land contains one hundred and eight or &s;ix thou&s;and acres. The land is almo&s;t intirely under cultivation; but I will reckon only upon the hundred thou&s;and. From a know|ledge of a multitude of apprai&s;ements made upon oath, by freeholders of the vicinity, upon occa&s;ions of deaths, or of extents for the payment of debts: from many actual &s;ales: I &s;tate that thirty pounds an acre is a rea&s;onable valuation. I include with the land all the dwelling-hou&s;es in the country, the &s;ugar-works and the young crops. I throw in the cattle, the plantation, and hou&s;hold furniture. This article, the land, amounts to three millions. The negroes, by a poll-tax, in which the whole number is certainly not included, are &s;eventy-five thou&s;and; cheap at forty pounds each, they make a &s;econd &s;um of three millions. I throw in the two towns, who&s;e rents amount to forty thou&s;ands pounds a year, as a ca&s;ting weight
<PB N="57" REF="56">
to make good the aggregate &s;um of &s;ix mil|lions. Taking Barbadoes as a &s;tandard, by which to mea&s;ure all the re&s;t of the &s;ugar colonies, I ob&s;erve that the &s;ugar exported from Barbadoes to all parts, at a medium of many years (it is a calculation formed upon the receipts of the duty of four and an half per cent.) is about fifteen thou&s;and common hog&s;heads a year. Now the &s;ugar imported into Great-Britain alone, from all the &s;ugar colonies, amounted in the year &s;eventy-three to one hundred and &s;eventy-thou&s;and hog&s;|heads, allowing ten hundred weight of &s;ugar to a hog&s;head. The import of &s;eventy-four is more. I will &s;uppo&s;e the produce of Bar|badoes to be as one in ten. If a part of the Barbadoes &s;ugar is clayed, if its mu&s;covado is propere&s;t for common u&s;e, yet there are clayed &s;ugars from other i&s;lands; the mu&s;|covado of &s;everal, e&s;pecially of St. Kitt's, is fitter for the refiner. Be&s;ides, twenty thou|&s;and &s;uch hog&s;heads are deducted, and a greater number of common hog&s;heads, I mean the exports to North America, are omitted, before the proportion of one in ten is &s;tated. If Barbadoes yields ginger, cotton and alloes, the other colonies add to the &s;ame products, coffee, pimento and other articles. The capital of Barbadoes then being &s;ix mil|lions, and its produce as one in ten of the produce of all the We&s;t Indies, it is fair to conclude, at the &s;ame proportion, the capital of the whole to be &s;ixty millions: a conclu|&s;ion
<PB N="58" REF="57">
which amply warrants the petition in de|claring it to be upwards of thirty millions. I take nothing in the e&s;timate for the value of the future increa&s;e of Jamaica and the new &s;ettled i&s;lands.</P>
<P>Q. Can you make any e&s;timate of the va|lue of We&s;t India property owned by per&s;ons who live in England? and of the amount of the debt due to this kingdom from the We&s;t Indies?</P>
<P>A. Of the millions ve&s;ted in the We&s;t Indies, many are the property of per&s;ons re|&s;iding in England, and not a few are united and con&s;olidated with the landed property of this kingdom. It is difficult to a&s;certain the total. I have endeavoured at a calculation for Barbadoes, and am below the mark in &s;tating it at one million four hundred thou|&s;and pounds. In the other i&s;lands, for ob|vious rea&s;ons, the proportion is greater than in Barbadoes. The mo&s;t eminent merchants will tell you, that they have hardly any body to corre&s;pond with in St. Chri&s;topher's, ex|cept the over&s;eers of plantations. Re&s;uming Barbadoes as a rule to mea&s;ure with, the pro|portion is fourteen millions. It is a more difficult and a le&s;s plea&s;ing ta&s;k to inve&s;tigate the millions due to the merchants and others in this kingdom, upon the &s;ecurity of We&s;t India plantations. I can form no particular e&s;timate. The &s;um in general is immen&s;e. The &s;ugar-trade, from its infancy, by rea&s;on of the &s;mall capitals of the fir&s;t planters, and
<PB N="59" REF="58">
the great co&s;t of a &s;ugar manufacture, mu&s;t have been the creatures of credit. It was rai&s;ed to the pre&s;ent pitch by the wealth of the merchant &s;upporting the indu&s;try of the planter. Neither is it nece&s;&s;ary to be exact in the value of the property of the Engli&s;h re&s;idents, nor of the debt to the Engli&s;h merchants and others. For the &s;ugar colo|nies are really no other than a Briti&s;h manu|facture, e&s;tabli&s;hed at the di&s;tance of three and four thou&s;and miles for rea&s;ons of con|venience. And the dependence of this ma|nufacture is the &s;ame as if it was &s;ituated in the heart of the kingdom. I do not retract the idea of its dependence upon North Ame|rica. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, it can be &s;ugge&s;ted only in theory, Great-Britain mu&s;t draw from North America the &s;upplies without which her manufacture, where&s;oever it is &s;ituated, is incapable of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting.</P>
<P>Q. What are the advantages of the &s;ugar colonies to Great-Britain? and what to the revenue thereof?</P>
<P>A. I de&s;ire, Sir, I may con&s;ider them as a Briti&s;h manufacture, who&s;e capital is &s;ixty millions. The advantage is not that the pro|fits all ultimately centre here: it is, that it creates, in the cour&s;e of attaining tho&s;e pro|fits a commerce and a navigation, in which multitudes of your people, and millions of your money are employed. It is, that the &s;upport which the &s;ugar colonies receive in one &s;hape, they give in another. In propor|tion
<PB N="60" REF="59">
to their dependence upon North Ameri|ca, and upon Ireland, they enable North America and Ireland to trade with Great-Britain. By their dependence upon Great-Britain for hands to pu&s;h the cultivation of the &s;ugar-cane, they uphold the trade of Great-Britain to Africa. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The medium of fourteen years from 1756 to 1773, is 469, 237 l. Imports from Africa 49, 858 l.</NOTE> A trade which in the pur&s;uit of negroes, as the principal, if not the &s;ole intention of the adventurer, brings home ivory and gold as &s;econdary objects. In proportion as the &s;ugar colonies con&s;ume, or cau&s;e to be con&s;umed among&s;t their neighbours, A&s;iatic commodities, they increa&s;e the trade of the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t India Company. In this light I &s;ee the India goods, which are carried to the coa&s;t of Guinea. In proportion as the We&s;t Indies u&s;e the wines of the African i&s;lands, and as they u&s;e the products of Europe, &s;o far they add to the trade of Great-Britain with the African i&s;lands, and with the re&s;t of Europe. With|out taking in any of the circuitous channels, the direct exports to the We&s;t Indies will ap|pear, by official accounts, to be of immen&s;e value, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Medium of exports for fourteen years from Chri&s;tmas 1756, to Chri&s;tmas 1773, is 1, 145, 735 l.</NOTE> will &s;hew the wealth gradually earned by the hand of labour and of &s;kill, which the &s;ugar colonies are daily adding to the national &s;tock. I hardly dare venture to place in this light the &s;alaries and profits of
<PB N="61" REF="60">
the officers appointed by government for the &s;uperintendence of the We&s;t Indies. As to revenue, the nett receipt I under&s;tand to exceed &s;even hundred thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>Q. In ca&s;e the u&s;ual intercour&s;e between North-America and the &s;ugar colonies, &s;hould be interrupted, what would be the prejudice to Great-Britain, and to the revenue thereof?</P>
<P>A. The advantages ari&s;ing from, and de|pendant upon the u&s;ual intercour&s;e, mu&s;t cea&s;e with the interruption. I will not add, that the nation is to pay in money to the foreign|ers, the large &s;um for We&s;t-India commodi|ties, for which the Briti&s;h manufactures, and the profits of a circuitous commerce, are now given in exchange. The ob&s;ervation would be fallacious. The decrea&s;e in the con&s;umption of We&s;t-India commodities will &s;urely keep pace with the decay of the manu|factures and commerce the We&s;t-India &s;up|ported. The revenue will le&s;&s;en in propor|tion to the dimini&s;hed con&s;umption, nor will the lo&s;s &s;top at the We&s;t-India commodities. The revenue from tea, without the accu&s;tomed plenty of &s;ugar, without the profits of the &s;ugar trade, and of the commerce created by the &s;ugar trade, will &s;ink into in&s;igni|ficance; the interruption will be felt &s;everely in every branch of revenue; for it will be felt &s;everely in every branch of trade which contributes by con&s;umption to the revenue; and in trade, as in the human body, nothing &s;uffers &s;ingly by it&s;elf; there is a
<PB N="62" REF="61">
con&s;ent of parts in the &s;y&s;tem of both, and the partial evil grows into univer&s;al mi&s;chief. Of all the branches of commerce which will &s;uffer immediately, or indirectly, from the interruption of the u&s;ual intercour&s;e, the mo&s;t important is the navigation. By inve&s;ti|gating its value, we e&s;timate the lo&s;s. It is equal to the bulky products, and &s;till more bulky &s;upplies of a &s;tock in trade of &s;ixty millions: it is co-exten&s;ive with the commerce created by that trade, comprehending the navigation to Africa, and making no incon|&s;iderable part of that of England to the Ea&s;t Indies, and to the re&s;t of Europe. It e&s;ta|bli&s;hes, as is a&s;&s;erted in the petition, a &s;trength, which wealth can neither purcha&s;e nor balance. Sir, I will add, it is a &s;trength which is &s;o ju&s;tly a favourite with the nation, that nothing but &s;ome unhappy mi&s;take can deprive it of the national protection and &s;upport.</P>

<P>Q. What is the common food of the negroes in the Leeward I&s;lands?</P>
<P>A. In all the i&s;lands it is &s;alt fi&s;h (as I &s;aid before) and Indian corn. I entered into tho&s;e points particularly before.</P>
<P>Q. Whether the i&s;lands will not be &s;upplied equally well, notwith&s;tanding the Newfound|land
<PB N="63" REF="62">
fi&s;hery from New-England &s;hould be &s;topped?</P>
<P>A. That is a matter of opinion. I came here as an evidence of facts, which I hope will influence the opinions of the Hou&s;e, but not to obtrude my own. My opinion is, that they will not have the u&s;ual &s;upply, becau&s;e there will not be the u&s;ual quantity taken, and fewer people to carry it to them.</P>
<P>Q. What proportion of land in the Lee|ward I&s;lands, being applied to the rai&s;ing provi&s;ion, would &s;upply the negroes with provi&s;ions, on an e&s;tate of 200 hog&s;heads, for in&s;tance?</P>
<P>A. The native products of the i&s;lands are very uncertain; all &s;o, but Guinea corn; therefore much more land mu&s;t be applied to this purpo&s;e than would be nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e the &s;upply for the regular con&s;tant con|&s;umption. They mu&s;t provide again&s;t acci|dents, &s;uch as hurricanes, exce&s;s of wet weather, or of dry weather, the climate being very uncertain; it is therefore impo&s;&s;ible to an&s;wer this que&s;tion preci&s;ely: but this I can &s;ay, that if they were obliged to rai&s;e their own food, that their food mu&s;t be then their principal object, and &s;ugar only a &s;econdary object; it would be but the trifle, which pro|vi&s;ions are now.</P>
<P>Q. If the planters could not be &s;upplied from North-America, would they not have a &s;hare of fre&s;h provi&s;ions from Great-Britain and Ireland, to an&s;wer their wants?</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="63">
A. They mu&s;t have more than a &s;hare; they mu&s;t have a full proportion for their whole &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and England cannot afford it; it would occa&s;ion a &s;carcity at home.</P>
<P>Q. Would not the merchants here &s;end out cargoes of provi&s;ions to the We&s;t-Indies?</P>
<P>A. I an&s;wered that que&s;tion, and mo&s;t of the others before, by obviating them in my evidence. I have &s;aid, and repeat, that Great-Britain cannot increa&s;e her exports of provi&s;ions to the We&s;t-Indies, without increa&s;|ing a &s;carcity already complained of at home.</P>
<P>Q. What quantity of flour is allowed to the white people on an e&s;tate of 200 hog|&s;heads?</P>
<P>A. No regular allowance. They have rice, bi&s;cuit, as they may want, in propor|tion as a variety of things, which are pro|vided for them by the plantation, falls &s;hort or abounds.</P>
<P>Q. Whether deal boards would not do in the room of &s;taves for packing &s;ugar?</P>
<P>A. The Portugue&s;e pack in che&s;ts; but they are not made of deal boards, but of &s;trong plank. We mu&s;t make a total altera|tion in our &s;hipping, our trade&s;men, and many circum&s;tances, if we were to pack our &s;ugar in che&s;ts.</P>
<P>Q. Whether there are not many packs of &s;taves &s;hipped to the We&s;t-Indies from Lon|don, both for rum and &s;ugar?</P>
<P>A. I have known &s;ome for &s;ugar; but it has been found nece&s;&s;ary to mix them with
<PB N="65" REF="64">
many new &s;taves from North-America. Our &s;taves, like our cloths, wear out by u&s;e; many of them are broken in the voyage, and the re&s;t are &s;eldom fit for much.</P>
<P>Q. I mean new &s;taves.</P>
<P>A. I never knew any &s;ent, (&s;uppo&s;ing the words to have been new ca&s;ks) but as pack|ages for goods exported to the We&s;t-Indies; this is &s;ometimes done, and the ca&s;ks &s;o made as to be u&s;ed afterwards for &s;ugar and rum; but this is done merely to &s;ave parti|cular packages for the goods; nor even in that ca&s;e is it always thought an advantage.</P>
<P>Q. I mean &s;taves &s;ent on purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>A. I cannot an&s;wer that, but by &s;aying, I never knew an in&s;tance of it. I know &s;taves are brought from the We&s;t-Indies to London, upon a pro&s;pect of advantage; but I never knew them &s;ent from hence to the We&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>Q. How are the French i&s;lands &s;upplied with lumber, bread, flour, &amp;c.</P>
<P>A. I cannot give a preci&s;e an&s;wer to that que&s;tion. I have &s;aid they receive great &s;up|plies from North-America. I have mention|ed before, that the French, Dutch, and Danes, in their &s;ugar colonies, depend in a great mea&s;ure on North-America; but I do not know the particulars preci&s;ely.</P>
<P>Q. Whether he does not know, that the French carry on ten times the trade with North-America that the Engli&s;h do?</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="65">
A. I do not know the extent of the French trade; I am not well enough acquainted with it, &s;o as at this time to be able to &s;tate propo&s;itions. I have &s;aid, there is a certain degree of dependence of the French i&s;lands on North-America.</P>
<P>Q. Whether, if the Americans were pre|vented from trading with the French i&s;lands, it would be advantageous to Great-Britain?</P>
<P>A. A &s;peculative opinion is a&s;ked; I &s;peak only to facts.</P>

<P><HI>John Ellis, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI> called in.</P>
<P>Q. What is your &s;ituation?</P>
<P>A. I am a planter of Jamaica, have re|&s;ided in that i&s;land at different periods from 1754 to 1773.</P>
<P>Q. Inform the committee what you know of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Jamaica in general, and of her dependence in particular on North-America, in regard to the reciprocal exchange of commodities between them.</P>
<P>A. The i&s;land of Jamaica being of great extent, the &s;everal parts of which differ from each other, from a variety of circum&s;tances attending their re&s;pective &s;ituations, it is im|po&s;&s;ible to give any one general an&s;wer, that is not liable to many exceptions. The i&s;land contains nearly four million of acres, of which I compute 160,000 acres to be planted in &s;ugar canes, and I &s;uppo&s;e a little above double that quantity of land is kept as a nece&s;&s;ary appendage to the &s;ugar e&s;tates, and
<PB N="67" REF="66">
employed in pa&s;turage and grounds allotted to the negroes for provi&s;ions, and in furni&s;h|ing timbers, fire-wood, lime, &amp;c. the whole of which makes 500,000 acres. In other &s;ettlements, &s;uch as piemento, cotton, coffee, ginger, and penland for breeding cattle, and in provi&s;ion plantations in the neighbourhood of the towns, I reckon as much more. The remaining three million con&s;i&s;ts of a great wilderne&s;s, chiefly mountainous, in which it may be pre&s;umed there are many intermediate tracts capable of cultivation, but which from difficulty of acce&s;s, and the little pro&s;pect of profit adequate to the &s;tock requi&s;ite for their &s;ettlement, continue in their pre&s;ent &s;tate: for however rich any lands may be in them|&s;elves, yet if the circum&s;tances attending their cultivation, are &s;uch as to render it pro|bable that the capital to be employed will not produce an adequate return, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that any prudent per&s;on will adven|ture therein. In &s;o large a tract the &s;oil is various, and adapted to the production of different commodities; the climate and &s;ea|&s;ons al&s;o differ greatly. On the &s;outh &s;ide, at the extremities of the i&s;land, the pari&s;hes of We&s;tmoreland and St. Thomas are &s;ea&s;on|able, or &s;upplied with refre&s;hing &s;howers, and the manurable lands are chiefly employed in the growth of the cane. The intermediate pari&s;hes near the &s;ea, being St. David, Port Royal, St. Andrew, St. Catherine, St. Do|rathy Vere, and St. Elizabeth, are &s;ubject to
<PB N="68" REF="67">
dry weather, in&s;omuch that particular &s;pots only are employed in the cultivation of &s;ugar. The flat lands are chiefly appropriated to the purpo&s;es of rai&s;ing cattle, and the moun|tanious lands, in the vicinity of Spani&s;h Town and King&s;ton, be&s;ides producing coffee, ginger, and a little piemento, afford a partial &s;upply of provi&s;ions, &s;uch as plantains, roots and Indian corn. The inland pari&s;hes of the &s;outh &s;ide, St. John's, St. Thomas in the vale, and &s;ome part of Clarendon, being more &s;ea&s;onable, rai&s;e, I believe, in plentiful years, a &s;ufficiency of the above provi&s;ions for their own &s;upport, and &s;ometimes furni&s;h relief to the neighbouring pari&s;hes. The &s;everal pari&s;hes on the north &s;ide, are fertile and in general &s;ea&s;onable; excepting on &s;ome parts of the &s;ea coa&s;t, where I have known the drought &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, as it was particularly in the year 1770, and the calls of di&s;tre&s;s &s;o loud, that neither the back lands nor the neighbouring pari&s;hes could afford &s;ufficient relief, and had it not been for &s;upplies from North-America, many thou&s;and negroes mu&s;t have peri&s;hed for want. On the whole, tho' the i&s;land of Jamaica has, in re&s;pect of inter|nal &s;upplies, greatly the advantage over Barbadoes and the other Briti&s;h &s;ugar i&s;lands; yet from the circum&s;tances of drought and gu&s;ts of wind which happen frequently, and are particularly de&s;tructive to the plantain trees which yield the chief &s;upport of the negroes, her dependence on North-America
<PB N="69" REF="68">
in point of provi&s;ions, is very great, and cannot, I think, be le&s;&s;ened in any con&s;ider|able degree, without dimini&s;hing the growth of the &s;taple commodities of &s;ugar and rum; for be&s;ides tho&s;e articles which chiefly con&s;ti|tute or &s;upply the place of bread, &s;uch as flour, rice, corn, and pea&s;e, &s;he receives from America great quantities of &s;alted fi&s;h; which with herrings from Europe, &s;erve the negroes as meat. I confine my&s;elf in this &s;tate to matters of mere &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for our ne|groe &s;laves, without taking into the e&s;timate the great quantities of pork and other &s;alted provi&s;ions imported from America for the u&s;e of the white inhabitants. In regard to lum|ber, for that &s;pecies which is called &s;taves and heading, and of which we make the packages for our &s;ugar and rum, the depen|dence which Jamaica has on North-America may be judged of from this circum&s;tance. The i&s;land at pre&s;ent yields about 80,000 hog&s;heads of &s;ugar, and about 30,000 punch|eons of rum for exportation. Now I am po&s;i|tive that not 3000 of the ca&s;ks nece&s;&s;ary to con|tain this great quantity of produce, are made from Jamaica wood; a few puncheons indeed are imported from England, and al&s;o &s;ome few Hambro' &s;taves, the puncheons being packages of goods &s;ent out; but all the re&s;t we receive from the middle colonies of North America and from Georgia. With regard to the other &s;pecies of lumber, &s;uch as &s;cant|ling, boards, and &s;hingles for hou&s;es, the dif|ferent
<PB N="70" REF="69">
towns are chiefly built with the&s;e arti|cles from North-America; as are al&s;o the buildings of mo&s;t of the &s;ettlements on the &s;ea coa&s;t. The interior parts of the country, being in the neighbourhood of large woods, &s;upply them&s;elves from the growth of the country, or at lea&s;t I think ought &s;o to do.</P>
<P>To conclude, the &s;upplies annually im|ported into Jamaica, chiefly from the a&s;&s;oci|ated provinces of North America, con&s;i&s;ting of pitch, tar, turpentine, lamp oil, boards, joi&s;ts, plank, hog&s;head and puncheon &s;taves, &s;hingles, &amp;c hor&s;es, and a great variety of provi&s;ions, &s;uch as flour, Indian corn, bi&s;cuit, beef, pork, &s;alted fi&s;h of different kinds, and rice, amount by the mo&s;t exact calculation I am able to make, to upwards of 150,000 l. &s;terling, in payment of which the Americans receive &s;ugar, rum, coffee, ginger, and other articles of Jamaica produce. The North Americans have of late years imported al&s;o con&s;iderable quantities of ca&s;h, which, with their cargoes, they lay out in the purcha&s;e of the above articles.</P>
<P>Q. In &s;o va&s;t a &s;pace as three millions of acres of un&s;ettled land, do you not appre|hend there are great many tracts capable of cultivation, and of producing provi&s;ions, and many other articles of tho&s;e &s;upplies, which at pre&s;ent are furni&s;hed from North America?</P>
<P>A. Doubtle&s;s there are; but the planter mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, and will irremediably &s;uffer
<PB N="71" REF="70">
before tho&s;e lands can be prepared for cul|tivation, and yield them a &s;ufficient &s;upply. He will even &s;uffer by his dependence on the wi&s;dom and interpo&s;ition of parliament; not perceiving, till it is too late, the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of converting his di&s;tant lands, if he has any, into provi&s;ion &s;ettlements, be|fore the calamities attending di&s;tre&s;s and want, will overtake him. I &s;peak now in regard to provi&s;ions only; a failure in which may be attended with the mo&s;t alarming con&s;e|quences, from rebellions of the &s;laves. As to lumber, tho&s;e plantations which are &s;ituated near con&s;iderable tracts of wood-land, may doubtle&s;s, at all times, obtain a partial &s;upply, though very few &s;pecies of wood are fit for the purpo&s;es of making &s;taves for &s;ugar ca&s;ks; as to ca&s;ks for rum, the i&s;land affords no proper wood: but I know not how the other e&s;tates are to be furni&s;hed, except from A|merica. And after all, &s;uppo&s;ing the i&s;land had re&s;ources within her&s;elf, and could, in time, actually &s;upply both lumber and pro|vi&s;ion in &s;ufficient quantity, it mu&s;t be re|membered that &s;even-eights of the planters are already deeply in debt to Great-Britain, and cannot &s;upport the expence of great land carriage, which mu&s;t unavoidably attend the cutting their own wood, and bringing it to their e&s;tates; neither can they obtain credit to make new &s;ettlements for the purpo&s;es of rai&s;ing provi&s;ions. It follows, therefore, and the fact really is, however fortunate a few in|dividuals
<PB N="72" REF="71">
may be in re&s;pect to the &s;ituation of their e&s;tates, that the planters in general cannot &s;ubmit to the nece&s;&s;ity of cutting their own lumber, and of rai&s;ing greater quanti|ties of provi&s;ions than the i&s;land at pre&s;ent affords, without neglecting, in a proporti|onate degree, the &s;taple articles of &s;ugar and rum; and I need not point out to the com|mittee, how greatly the trade, revenues and navigation of this country will &s;uffer, by a diminution in the growth and manufacture of the&s;e commodities.</P>
<P>Q. What do you apprehend will be the con&s;equence to Jamaica, in ca&s;e the &s;upply of provi&s;ions from North America is inter|rupted?</P>
<P>A. I have partly an&s;wered that que&s;tion before. Tho&s;e plantations which have not good provi&s;ion grounds for their negroes, will &s;oon be in a &s;tarving condition; and even tho&s;e which have, mu&s;t &s;uffer greatly; for the negroes are a very thoughtle&s;s impro|vident people: they do not look forward to provide again&s;t tho&s;e evils which too fre|quently happen; &s;uch as droughts which de|&s;troy their ground provi&s;ions, and gu&s;ts of wind which throw down their plantation trees. Tho&s;e who are in want will &s;teal; when they can no longer &s;teal, and hunger pre&s;&s;es, they will take by force. What fur|ther con&s;equence may ari&s;e, I dread to think of.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="72">
Q. Are there not places, be&s;ides the mid|dle colonies of North America, from whence may be drawn a &s;upply of lumber?</P>
<P>A. I apprehend not. Georgia, indeed, furni&s;hes at pre&s;ent, in &s;mall quantities, &s;cantling and boards for building, and &s;ome few &s;taves. How far that province is capa|ble of increa&s;ing the export of the&s;e articles, I cannot &s;ay; but it mu&s;t &s;urely be many years before it equals that of all the confe|derated colonies together. As to Canada, and the two Floridas, the population at the extremities of the continent, is too feeble to promi&s;e any great &s;upply from thence. The navigation from Canada is ob&s;tructed many months in the year by the ice; but however this may be, the&s;e countries do not afford any &s;upply at pre&s;ent; and I believe it is contrary to the known principles of commerce, to expect that any country can yield an adequate &s;upply to a great, an im|mediate, and unexpected demand.</P>
<P>Q. What do you compute the value of the property in that i&s;land?</P>
<P>A. Twenty four millions &s;terling. I &s;hall not take up the time of the committee, by a long tedious calculation. In every well appointed property the value of negroes con|&s;titute a third of the capital. By a well appointed property, I mean a property where the ma&s;ter is competent to the furni&s;hing it with a &s;ufficient &s;tock of negroes and cattle, and every nece&s;&s;ary appendage. In &s;uch pro|perties,
<PB N="74" REF="73">
the value of negroes con&s;titute a third of the capital: but the greater part of the properties in the i&s;land, from the inability of the planters, have not a due proportion of negroes, and in &s;uch the value of the ne|groes does not exceed one-fourth of the ca|pital. I &s;hall, however, make my calculation upon a &s;uppo&s;ition, that all the properties in the i&s;land are &s;ufficiently &s;tocked with ne|groes, and that the value of negroes there|fore con&s;titute one-third part of the general capital of the i&s;land. Now the number of negroes in the i&s;land of Jamaica exceed 200,000; however I &s;hall e&s;timate them only at 200,000, and I &s;hall value them only at the &s;ame rate with the African cargoes; of them I have lately &s;een &s;everal &s;ales, and they average for each negroe from 40 l. to 45 l. but I will put them only at 40 l. and I &s;hall rate the negroes of the i&s;land, who are &s;ea|&s;oned to the country, are civilized, and have acquired arts, at the &s;ame value with the &s;avages newly imported from Africa; 200,000 negroes, therefore, at the rate of 40 l. each, amount to eight millions, and the negroes con&s;tituting one-third of the general capital, the whole capital of the i&s;land amounts to twenty-four millions.</P>
<P>Mr. Glover having fini&s;hed with this evi|dence, &s;ome que&s;tions were a&s;ked by Mr. <HI>Innes</HI> relative to particular articles of provi|&s;ion, and in what quantities they were fur|ni&s;hed
<PB N="75" REF="74">
to the negroes by their ma&s;ters; in an&s;wer to which Mr. Ellis a&s;&s;erted, that the dependence of the i&s;land upon foreign pro|vi&s;ions was &s;o very great, that if the ma&s;ters did not attend to, and &s;upply the wants of their &s;laves, many thou&s;ands of them mu&s;t peri&s;h.</P>
