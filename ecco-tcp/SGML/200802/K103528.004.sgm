<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF TATE WILKINSON.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE been told I could prevent riotous proceed|ings.&mdash;But I mu&s;t beg leave to ob&s;erve, that the|atrical opinions are &s;o variable, un&s;ettled, and pre|judiced, that I fear my rea&s;ons will have as little effect as if I were to entreat that all metho|di&s;ts would follow the playhou&s;e, or that metho|di&s;ts could per&s;uade all play attendants to become devotees at the tabernacle.</P>
<P>The good government that prevails in general at Drury Lane and Covent Garden theatres is owing to uniformity; decorum begets decorum. Con&s;equently the &s;trict order to be found in the London audiences does not owe its happy pre|&s;ervation entirely to three or four con&s;tables in waiting, or to ten or twelve of the King's guards.
<PB N="4" REF="4">
Witne&s;s the great riot on the Chine&s;e Fe&s;tival at Drury Lane, in &s;pite of the &s;anction of his Maje&s;ty King George the Second, who was there in per&s;on.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance.&mdash;When the French actors were to have performed at the Haymarket theatre, Ju&s;tice Du <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eil, attended by con&s;tables, and re|inforced with the King's guards, were defeated by numbers and determined phrenzy; then, truly, might overcame right.</P>
<P>Nay, yearly at Chri&s;tmas holidays in London, on retro&s;pection, the plays are indi&s;tinctly and with difficulty got through.</P>
<P>On an uproar, when Lady Coventry and &s;eve|ral other per&s;ons of quality were obliged to quit the &s;tage-box, on account of a &s;uppo&s;ed affront given to Mi&s;s Bellamy in Juliet, it was the audi|ence and not any other force compelled tho&s;e di|&s;turbers to leave the theatre.</P>
<P>In 1754, when Captain Smith of the guards gave offence on the fir&s;t night Mr Murphy ap|peared in Jaffier, and only his &s;econd character on the &s;tage, it was the general voice that would not permit the play to pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">d till the cau&s;e of inter|ruption was re <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">oved.</P>
<P>At York formerly, on a Shrove Tue&s;day, mere|ly from a &s;avage cu&s;tom, the upper gallery was &s;o noi&s;y from num ers, that it could not be con|quered but by rai&s;ing the price on that night, and
<PB N="5" REF="5">
which has by the experiment in a great mea&s;ure removed the evil.</P>
<P>I beg leave to be here under&s;tood as &s;peaking of theatres in general; but when the propriety of London is &s;ingled out, let it be well recollected that <HI>the audiences there pre&s;erve their own re&s;pect;</HI> for the in&s;tant the curtain draws up all noi&s;e &s;ub&s;ides, and every per&s;on &s;its down; nor will they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">uffer the actors to proceed if a hat remains on a head: but in mo&s;t country theatres, when the perform|ance begins, the vgazers in the galleries &s;tand up, and with their hats on; nay hats are too often &s;een on in the pit.</P>
<P>If at London a rioter is vociferous in the gal|lery, they are from cu&s;tom and good regulation &s;o habituated to order and nece&s;&s;ary attention, that the offender is by <HI>univer&s;al</HI> con&s;ent delivered over to the con&s;tables, who not only conducts the cul|prit out of the gallery, but if guilty of throwing bottles, &amp;c. on the &s;tage, or into the pit or boxes, he is conveyed before a ju&s;tice to be properly puni&s;h|ed. A di&s;turbance there, even of a &s;hort dura|tion, &s;eldom happens in the pit; for the in&s;tant of interruption the per&s;on is removed by force, and turned out with di&s;grace and ignominy.</P>
<P>To repeat more as to my&s;elf concerning the winter at Edinburgh in 1765 would not only be ful&s;ome and impertinent, but is far from being
<PB N="6" REF="6">
nece&s;&s;ary, nor would it be entertaining. I acted a variety of characters, and &s;uffice it to &s;ay I was well received, and met with great civilities and in|dulgences: Richard, Bayes, and Foote's pieces were repeated. My fir&s;t benefit, on Friday, March 22, was a fine hou&s;e: Alexander was revived, with a triumph, &amp;c. at the managers' expence, and a farce written by Mr. Chaigneau, of Dublin, called Harlequin Soldier, taken from the French. My &s;e|cond benefit was the la&s;t night in the &s;ea&s;on, Sa|turday, April 13, another play, never acted there, called Coriolanus, with a new burle&s;que farce in two acts, wrote by Dr. Schombergh of Bath, called Bucephalus: The play plea&s;ed much&mdash;the farce not at all&mdash;though after playing Co|riolanus I produced my&s;elf as Prince&s;s Statira. In a few days I engaged to proceed with the ma|nagers and company to Gla&s;gow, where my bar|gain was chiefly dependent on two clear benefits, and full of hopes that a &s;econd fire would not be wickedly put into practice, or even attempted, as had been the year before. Mo&s;t of the &s;ame plays acted at Edinburgh were ready, and repeated at Gla&s;gow. My fir&s;t benefit was upwards of 62 l. The play was Henry the Fourth; Fal&s;taff, Mr. Lanca&s;ter; Prince of Wales, Mr. Aickin; Hot&s;pur, Mr. Wilkin&s;on: The farce I have forgot.&mdash;Lan|ca&s;ter was a great favourite at Edinburgh.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="7">
My &s;econd benefit was only 30l.&mdash;The Play was E&s;&s;ex: E&s;&s;ex, Mr. Wilkin&s;on; with Tra|gedy A-la-Mode, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;ible, the friendly, the &s;pirited, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> vivacious Mr. Sinclair (of whom York boa&s;ts as an honourable acqui&s;ition to its inhabitants) was that year at Gla&s;gow college: I have had the plea|&s;ure of hearing him declare the fir&s;t play he ever &s;aw acted was the night I appeared in the difficult character of King Lear at the Gla&s;gow theatre; and whether the performance was &s;uper-excellent or the contrary is not for me to determine: But I dare affirm (being the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion made on his youthful mind) that he was highly delighted, and will never forget Wilkin&s;on's Lear, let any ac|tor's merit, how great &s;oever, interfere on his &s;ight and more enlightened judgment.</P>
<P>I do not recollect any circum&s;tance worth re|lating in that trip to Gla&s;gow, except my having the plea&s;ure of being on a degree of intimacy with the worthy Mr. John Moore, known better by be|ing called the good <HI>Johnny Moore;</HI> he was a gentleman (very extraordinary to &s;ay) that every body loved and re&s;pected. At his hou&s;e I was often mo&s;t agreeably entertained, and particularly whenever Mr. Nichol&s;on Stewart and others paid him a vi&s;it, and came on a trip to &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the play from Edinburgh. That &s;aid good character Mr.
<PB N="8" REF="8">
Moore, is mentioned, not only by Mrs. Bellamy, but al&s;o by Doctor Smollet in his novel of Hum|phrey Clinker; all prai&s;ed and loved him: and &s;urely what every one &s;aid mu&s;t be true. I returned from Gla&s;gow to Newca&s;tle, where my old friend Mr. Baker, manager of the York company, was &s;tationed at the races at that town. It was their u&s;ual yearly &s;ervice at that time for the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, till York meeting the latter end of Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>I acted Cadwalladar on the Saturday in the New|ca&s;tle race-week, and Major Sturgeon the Mon|day following,&mdash;I had indeed been &s;ecretly en|gaged by Mr. Baker for Newca&s;tle (where I had never played till that time) before my departure from Gla&s;gow. I continued at Newca&s;tle (to the fini&s;hing of the &s;ea&s;on in Augu&s;t) at Mr. Parker's, the Turk's-Head in the Big Market, which hou&s;e Mr. Baker for many years made his con&s;tant place of re&s;idence. All went &s;moothly on&mdash;we had a good race-week, a good a&s;&s;ize-week, and &s;everal very good benefits.&mdash;Sir Francis Delaval cam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> down that &s;ummer from the &s;outh to his &s;eat of Seaton Delaval, built as I have been told under Sir John Vanbrugh's direction:&mdash;Mr. David Ro&s;s came there at the &s;ame time by the invitation of Sir Francis:&mdash;Sir John (now Lord) Delaval and his Lady were there; al&s;o Thomas Delaval, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> the younger brother; (and &s;orry am I to add, wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="9" REF="9">
is well known, that when Sir Francis died I lo&s;t a valuable and honourable friend; the younger brother is al&s;o dead). So that with engagements at Sir Francis Delaval's, many invitations at Newca&s;tle, where they are particularly ho&s;pitable, my time pa&s;&s;ed agreeably and profitably. I &s;et my&s;elf a hard ta&s;k preparatory to my own benefit, which was to fini&s;h the &s;ea&s;on, by getting up Mr. Macklin's favourite farce of Love A-la-Mode: With patience and a&s;&s;iduity it was a po&s;&s;ible work, and promi&s;ed much credit and ca&s;h:&mdash;To tell the truth I had by luck obtained the parts by the following method:&mdash;The part of Sir Archy I had to prepare my&s;elf in; Mr. Garrick &s;ent it to me at Winche&s;ter in the year 1760; Squire Groom from my friend Ned Shuter; Mordecai from Mr. Cre&s;wick, who had acted the part at Covent Garden; the lady's part from Mrs. Burden's copy, who played it at the &s;ame theatre: So I had only to make the Iri&s;h character of Sir Callaghan, which by the fre|quency of &s;eeing the farce, and the help of the fir&s;t act being printed in a magazine, made it with a little trouble more than half ready to my hands; Sir Theodore, a part from remembrance; the re&s;t of my own manufacture.</P>
<P>Mr. Macklin, it is true, was ju&s;tifiably angry; but mine, for his credit, was better acted, and
<PB N="10" REF="10">
more like his farce than the &s;tuff given in every country town with pur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">oined lines only: And Mr. Shylock to me proved him&s;elf no Jew, but a friend and a good Chri&s;tian; he forgot and for|gave, and occa&s;ionally favoured me with his per|mi&s;&s;ion to act the farce of Love A-la-Mode; though he after, jokingly, called me a great rogue. I could not but allow the ju&s;tice of his accu&s;ation; I have often invited him to vi&s;it York; but he was always better plea&s;ed by my vi&s;iting him, and accepting his cheer, good-will, and kindne&s;s, than trying the experiment of my York&s;hire board.</P>
<P>I concluded at Newca&s;tle with Love A-la-Mode. As the farce was got up with the care and the au&s;terity almo&s;t of Mr. Macklin him&s;elf, had he been the in&s;pector, it was received with an univer&s;al effect, almo&s;t equal to a London repre|&s;entation when that piece was in its highe&s;t e&s;ti|mation.&mdash;At Newca&s;tle it was ca&s;t as follows: Sir Archy, Mr. Wilkin&s;on; Sir Callaghan, Mr. Frod&s;ham; Squire Groom, Mr. Cre&s;wick, &amp;c. A crowded hou&s;e, and from the flattering recep|tion it was honoured with at that town, and in|deed from the compliments I received there at that time, my vanity &s;ugge&s;ted I &s;hould be a la&s;ting fa|vourite; though I aftewards experienced a con|trary
<PB N="11" REF="11">
temper, like the &s;aying of friends, who are &s;oon hot and as &s;oon cold.</P>
<P>The York races (which in the year 1765 were in their great glory) made me imagine Love A-la-Mode would prove of the highe&s;t con&s;equence there:&mdash;Good old Mr. Baker &s;aid, he could not be happy unle&s;s his adopted &s;on Tate Wilkin&s;on would oblige him by being at York that race|week; and he really treated me as a &s;on, with one fault attending a partial father, which was, <Q REND="inline">"All I did was right."</Q> Mr. Baker's liberality I had not the lea&s;t occa&s;ion to doubt; and if without any emolument whatever my &s;ervices could have plea|&s;ed or &s;erved &s;o worthy and kind a friend, they were &s;incerely at his command.&mdash;We came as fa|ther and &s;on to his hou&s;e at-York, where in fact I was the <HI>major <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">omo;</HI> and I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">aid to I by it&s;elf I, <HI>I</HI> &s;hould do great things at the theatre from Love A-la-Mode, which would go down more plea|&s;antly than my tea which they had not approved; and expected to be applauded as a Garrick, a Foote, and a Macklin, in the different characters: And here, good reader, you will ob&s;erve a le&s;&s;on for vanity, and as efficacious and as good a cure as are Spil&s;bury's drops for the &s;curvy, or Godbold's for a con&s;umption.&mdash;I was &s;o a&s;&s;ured of &s;ucce&s;s with Love A-la-Mode, &amp;c. though when in May 1764 I had not thought of ever vi&s;iting York
<PB N="12" REF="12">
again, notwith&s;tanding I had left that city in to|lerable favour that trip;&mdash;and mark, good reader, that to Love A-la-Mode&mdash;thereby hangs a tale and eventful hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The Monday in the race week I fixed on Cad|wallader in the farce, as a part I was certain the York audience were partial to me in, and judged I was e&s;tabli&s;hed in their opinions. (That year, 1765, was the &s;econd of the new theatre.) When at rehear&s;al that noon a me&s;&s;age was &s;ent to me, while on the &s;tage, that &s;everal gentlemen de&s;ired to &s;peak with me in Mr. Baker's dining-room; I in&s;tantly obeyed the &s;ummons, (fir&s;t de&s;iring the performers to wait) and in imagination a&s;&s;uring my&s;elf it mu&s;t certainly be a complimentary in|tended be&s;poke play, for my performing in &s;ome &s;hining character the night following. When I made my entrance into the room, in high mirth and glee, where the gentlemen were, and was &s;inging aloud&mdash; <Q><L>York races are ju&s;t now beginning,</L>
<L>The lads and their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;es are coming,</L></Q>
after my bow, and on the &s;urvey of features not recolle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ing one individual face there a&s;&s;embled, I naturally reque&s;ted to be acquainted with the ho|nour of their comman is, as I was at that time bu&s;ily engaged with my attention to the rehear&s;al
<PB N="13" REF="13">
of the Author, a farce of Mr. Foote's, which was intended for that very evening; when a young gentleman quickly replied, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, it is that very rehear&s;al and farce I came to put an immediate &s;top to;"</Q> then turning to Mr. Baker, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you need not be informed the York theatre is not licen&s;ed; and if you are not acquainted with ano|ther circum&s;tance, I beg you will under&s;tand you are guilty of a double offence, by a flagrant breach of law and flying in the face of authority, as the impudent libel called the Author, written by that &s;coundrel Foote, was &s;topped from any future performance &s;ix years ago, in December 1758, and has not been permitted &s;ince.&mdash;My name, Mr. Wilkin&s;on, is Aprice, and the character of Cadwallader, you mean to perform, is an affront to the memory of my father (who is now dead): As his &s;on, by G&mdash;d, I will not &s;uffer &s;uch in&s;o|lence to pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s either unnoticed or unpuni&s;hed&mdash;therefore if at night you dare attempt or pre|&s;ume to play that farce, my&s;elf and friends are determined, one and all, not to leave a bench or &s;cene in your theatre; &s;o, Mr. Wilkin&s;on your immediate and determinate an&s;wer."</Q>&mdash;I could only reply, refer to Mr. Baker, who was the manager and the proprietor; I was only on an engagement with that gentleman for the race week, and I &s;hould be guided by his opi|nion
<PB N="14" REF="14">
and direction.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Well, Mr. Baker," &s;aid Mr. Aprice, "we wait your deci&s;ion."</Q>&mdash;The old gentleman &s;poke thus: <Q REND="inline">"Why look ye, d'ye &s;ee, gentlemen, if &s;o be that is the ca&s;e, why as to the matter of that, Mr. Wilkin&s;on, d'ye &s;ee me, mu&s;t not act Cadwallader this evening."</Q>&mdash;That, Mr. Aprice &s;aid, was all he reque&s;ted, and added, that him&s;elf and friends would all attend the theatre that night, but expected no infringement to be made on the treaty, either by &s;ecret or offen&s;ive means, to cau&s;e an oppo&s;ition after the manager's word was given, then wi&s;hed a good race week, and Aprice and his numerous a&s;&s;ociation de|parted.</P>
<P>For &s;ome minutes Mr. Baker and I &s;tood and gazed at each other like Gayle&s;s and Sharp after Kitty Pry's departure&mdash;where one &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"O Sharp! Sharp!"</Q>&mdash;the other an&s;wers, <Q REND="inline">"O ma&s;ter! ma&s;ter!"</Q>&mdash;But when recovered a little from the dilemma, what was to be done? that was the que&s;tion!&mdash;To be or not to be? for I could not advance forward (the Author being a favou|rite farce) and &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"A party of gentlemen would not &s;uffer it to be acted, for if it was t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ey threat|ened a dangerous riot."</Q>&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">or could we give out hand-bills and inform the public a performer was dangerou&s;ly ill, who might immediately contra|dict it and a&s;&s;ert his being in perfect health: So in

council it was agreed to be naturally &s;tupid, &s;ay nothing, but &s;ub&s;titute the Mayor of Garratt, and proceed with the farce, &s;o changed, without any apology whatever.&mdash;It certainly was the &s;trange&s;t mode that ever was adopted, or that ever was &s;uf|fered without momentous con&s;equences, attended with &s;trict inquiring and inve&s;tigation.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;cene between Sir Jacob Jollup and Mr. Lint the apothecary, the <HI>a&s;toni&s;hed</HI> audience &s;at, each &s;taring in his fellow's face, like Shak|&s;peare's black&s;mith with his hammer up and &s;wal|lowing a tailor's news, and concluded it was &s;ome|thing new by Wilkin&s;on foi&s;ted into the Author; but when I was announced as the Major, and made my entrance, the reader will not be &s;urpri&s;ed when informed I was received with an univer&s;al hi&s;s.&mdash;I took no notice, but went on&mdash;The di&s;ap|probation continued, but not &s;o virulently as to occa&s;ion a &s;tand &s;till; and the reader may be a&s;|&s;ured we lo&s;t no time in getting our work over, but wi&s;hed for bed-time, and that all were well: for though I owed Heaven a debt, it is clearly evident it was not then due; and I was, like Fal|&s;taff, loath to pay before the day. At la&s;t the death of that day's life came on, the curtain drop|peo, and the poor Major Sturgeon &s;neaked away with marks of anger following at his heels, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">unk to bed to cover him&s;elf and his di&s;honour.
<PB N="16" REF="16">
So ended the fir&s;t le&s;&s;on of the week, where I ex|pected to have outdone my u&s;ual outdoings; but the greate&s;t generals have met with di&s;graces and misfortunes.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day I acted the Lyar, which went off wonderfully well; I breathed better than in the morning, and felt once more a little elated. I had fixed on the Apprentice as the entertainment, which the &s;ummer before had done much for me in London; but unfortunately it happened to be a favourite part of Mr. Frod&s;ham's, (who in truth did not play it well, but quite the contrary) and in that character I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ailed again, without a &s;ingle hand to a&s;&s;i&s;t; I laboured through a part which in London I had been much flattered by applau&s;e in the extreme; my imitations were not known in York&s;hire, therefore naturally pa&s;&s;ed without the lea&s;t effect:&mdash;The reader will &s;mile at the plea&s;ant week I had promi&s;ed my&s;elf, but I fed on thin diet, that of hope, which I doubted not would give a brilliant and good ending after the bad be|ginning.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day, for my third performance, I in|tended Sir John Brute in the Provoked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ife&mdash;a favourite part in which I had been honoured with much approbation at Newca&s;tle that &s;ummer.&mdash;The farce was the Uphol&s;terer.&mdash;And as I had &s;tood remarkably well in Dublin, in oppo&s;ition even to that excellent actor Mr. Woodward, repeatedly in the
<PB N="17" REF="17">
Ton&s;or, I judged my &s;ucce&s;s could not be doubted; and indeed I was &s;o like in voice, dre&s;s, and manner, it was a moot point which was which; but the cracking of nuts were the only tokens of appro|bation; and my <HI>nerves</HI> are irritated at the &s;ound from that hour to the pre&s;ent. I was particularly attached to Sir John Brute, and think it was not improper for me as a comedian, as I had paid the &s;tricte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t attention to Mr. Garrick in that part, and it might have been termed a lucky performance of mine. I had not &s;tudied it from my own &s;ug|ge&s;tion, but fir&s;t at the particular de&s;ire of Mr. <HI>Johnny Moore</HI> of Gla&s;gow.</P>
<P>About twelve on the Wedne&s;day, when I had fini&s;hed the rehear&s;al of the Provoked Wife, a deputation of gentlemen were &s;ent as amba&s;&s;adors from the ladies a&s;&s;embled then at Giordani's con|cert.&mdash;York races were then in their high glory. Giordani was at that time under the patronage of Lady Bingley, who had great &s;way in that town and county, and was really enthu&s;ia&s;tically mu&s;ical: &s;he &s;ettled 200l. a year on him; which annuity he en|joys to this day, and will to the end of his life.</P>
<P>The gentlemen who came from the rooms in|formed me and Mr. Baker, that Lady Bingley, and all the ladies a&s;&s;embled, &s;ent their compliments; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y wi&s;hed that night to make a point of vi&s;iting the theatre before they went to the rooms, in or|der

to &s;hew every encouragement to the manager, but it was with the provi&s;o that &s;o indecent a play as the Provoked Wife (which the ladies could not by any means countenance, and de&s;ired if their protection and patronage was worth con&s;ideration) might be changed to another comedy; but if their reque&s;t was not complied with, they &s;hould not on any account enter the theatre, as they would not by any means think of &s;etting out &s;o im|proper a repre&s;entation.&mdash;(Here was another bar again&s;t my ri&s;e to greatne&s;s at York, and from that fatal day my favourite part and play was al|mo&s;t exploded, and truly to my lo&s;s by its being expunged; for ladies to the boxes I never by any means could get to that well-wrote, entertaining piece, though I confe&s;s it has its blemi&s;hes.)&mdash;The ladies added, that as to the farce of the Uphol|&s;terer being altered it was very immaterial, as very few would continue after the play, but go to the rooms.&mdash;More comfort &s;till for unfortunate Wilkin&s;on!</P>

Now let me &s;peak in my own defence as to my merit in acting the part of Sir Archy: Fir&s;t, In the Scotch dialect I was very happy, having naturally a nice ear, and al&s;o repeated opportunities of improvement by having re&s;ided two winters in Scotland.&mdash;In that point I certainly had the advantage even of Mr. Macklin, yet not too Scotch for an Engli&s;h audience (for that may be po&s;&s;ible), as an actor may pronounce Scotch too well for a London audience, and yet that would be exactly right at Edinburgh. I could &s;peak Sir Archy without fear at Covent Garden theatre, but would not by any means at|tempt a Scotch character at Edinburgh, though I have been much honoured by their partiality; but at Newca&s;tle, one hundred miles &s;outh of Edinburgh, I was accounted a good actor, as to the dialect, and would have &s;eemed &s;till better at York, and &s;uperior to York again if I acted the part in London; as the purity of the language is naturally le&s;s under&s;tood the more di|&s;tant from the country, than in or on the borders of Scotland; and the performers in London, not acquainted with York&s;hire, &s;ub&s;titute the Wilt|&s;hire dialect in&s;tead of the northern, which is

quite oppo&s;ite: but to the London galleries the &s;ub&s;titute an&s;wers full as well; as, <HI>i&s;e zure,</HI> &amp;c. fulfils every idea of a Cockney's common com|prehen&s;ion. As to my playing the character, I was perfect to a letter, and knew every other part, and had fully comprehended and executed Sir Archy in Mr. Macklin's manner&mdash;to do which I was competent: So the fault I may &s;ay, as to its being &s;o unfavourably received, did not originate entirely from bad acting; in &s;hort, it was no more t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">an a chain of ill-luck that at one time or another, in a greater or le&s;s degree, pervades nearly all, who in the catalogue of life's calen|dar pa&s;s for men; and I may venture to a&s;&s;ert, without offence, that the public every where at times is a tickli&s;h and dangerous dependence, and there is no &s;tanding on &s;uch reliance with firmne&s;s, as the &s;oil is but a &s;andy foundation at the be&s;t.</P>

In my experi|ence and be&s;t ob&s;ervation his Hamlet (and Jaffier &s;till better) with all his eccentricity, I never &s;aw equalled but by Mr. Garrick and Mr. Barry at that time; (and of that period I am &s;peaking, not of the pre&s;ent day;) though Mr. Kembel's judgment may challenge what I &s;ay; as, be|&s;ides <HI>his</HI> various excellencies in that character, where the play is performed in the third act, the execution is not only &s;pirited, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es great feeling and fire, but the manner of conceiving tho&s;e pa&s;&s;age, and conveying them to the audi|ence,

Mr. Powell of London, who the &s;tage had cau&s;e to lament, is the neare&s;t a&s;&s;imilation I can give of Frod&s;ham. Mr. Powell had the opportunity of &s;trictly ob&s;erving real arti&s;ts, Garrick, and Barry, in all their modes and &s;hapes of grief&mdash;Inattentive Frod&s;ham unhappily was his own ma&s;ter, and a carele&s;s one; for though he &s;et him&s;elf difficult ta&s;ks, he only now and then pur&s;ued the trump of fame with ardency or alacrity, but lagged, and never reached the goal, though a very little &s;pur|ring and jockey&s;hip would have made him come in fir&s;t, and won many a theatrical plate. The public were &s;o infatuated (and indeed he was &s;o &s;uperior) that he ca&s;t all others at a di&s;tance in his York &s;ituation; and the audience too blindly and too partially (for his good) approved all he did beyond compari&s;on; and when in full pride, be|fore he wilfully &s;unk him&s;elf, I do not think any actor but Garrick would have been liked &s;o well; and even Garrick, not without &s;ome old maids' opinions at a &s;ecret cabal, where Frod&s;ham would have been voted &s;uperior, and under the ro&s;e ap|pointed the man for the ladies: Nor would that deci&s;ion in favour of Frod&s;ham have been from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lderly ladies only, as he had often melted the youthful fair ones of the tendere&s;t moulds, who&s;e he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ts have been &s;u&s;ceptible whenever Frod&s;ham was the lover.

Thus &s;ituated at 1l. 1s. per week &s;alary, Frod&s;ham had not any opportunity for ob&s;ervation or improvement:&mdash;no infringement was &s;uffered, or change of characters. Nay, &s;o tenacious was old Mr. Cri&s;p<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An old actor at York.</NOTE>, that it was &s;ome time, I believe, before he could be pre|vailed upon to re&s;ign Hamlet to Frod&s;ham and act the gho&s;t.

Frod&s;ham, be&s;ides his tragic abilities, acted &s;ome &s;uch parts as Lord Hardy, Young Bevil, Lord Townly, Sir George Airy, &s;ung very tolerably, and was a very decent Macheath.

Mr. Garrick told me the&s;e particulars him&s;elf, and a narrative much of the &s;ame purpo&s;e I had from Mr. Frod|&s;ham when I became acquainted with him in York&s;hire. Mr. Garrick declared he never be|held &s;uch a &s;trange mixture of merit and genius, as in that <HI>eccentric</HI> Frod&s;ham; and Frod&s;ham, without any idea of offence, weakly judged that
<PB N="44" REF="44">
his fame was equally known with the other great man's; and he was determined &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;h|ed actor as the York idol &s;hould not be deemed rude by being in London and not vi&s;iting his bro|ther Hamlet's altar. Frod&s;ham's remarks were rude, and not true, relative to tones; for Mr. Gar|rick &s;poke Hamlet as naturally and void of particu|lar tones as ever was heard, his voice being remark|ably harmonious, &s;trong, and plea&s;ing, though in his he&s;itation and repetition, off the &s;tage, he threw it into an affected manner, which habit had form|ed into nature. As to Mrs. Cibber's Ophelia, though I have &s;een many good ones I have not &s;een her like, nor ever expect it, as her &s;inging, voice, figure, and features, all combined, will ne|ver let me bury in oblivion her remembrance.&mdash;<Q><L>They all wither'd when my poor father died.</L>
<L>Methinks I &s;ee her now!</L>
<L>Where?</L>
<L>In my mind's eye, Horatio.</L></Q> But tones, until familiarized, may prevent favou|rite comedians, till their merit is e&s;tabli&s;hed, from having their voice reli&s;hed and approved. When I fir&s;t heard Mr. Quick his voice did not much plea&s;e me: Now I never hear the &s;ound of it, even from behind the &s;cenes, but I am as eager as any other attendant involuntarily to laugh, it

has to me &s;o whim&s;ical and very agreeable an ef|fect. With the tragedian this apparent difficulty is n t &s;o ea&s;ily got over: Ryan's voice was bad to a degree, &s;o was Mrs. Woffington's: Ryan, by having merit and worth, was &s;anctioned; and Mrs. Woffington, by the aid of beauty and merit, was a great favourite in Jane Shore, Lady Jane Gray, &amp;c. &amp;c.; but the&s;e are wonderful hazards to encounter.</P>
<P>Before I quit Mr. Frod&s;ham's mode of be|haviour at London, I mu&s;t inform the reader, that the &s;aid harum-&s;carum young gentleman, un|le&s;s he waited on Johnny Rich of Covent Garden theatre, that manager he feared would arraign him of being deficient in point of good-breeding, o|therwi&s;e he had not the lea&s;t inclination to be&s;tow an hour on that gentleman; as he had been in|formed Mr. Rich's genius was &s;uperficial, and &s;uppo&s;ing he neither under&s;tood plays, Greek, nor Latin, but encouraged pantomime only, he held him in the greate&s;t contempt.&mdash;Indeed the applau&s;e at York he commanded, and received from every alehou&s;e, had intoxicated his brain as much as the plentiful potations of <HI>York burgun|dy,</HI> with which, and other plea&s;ant &s;pirited draughts, he too &s;oon fini&s;hed his early days of life and fame: He had by the lower people been &s;o loaded with more fancied honours than he could carry, that he had not a &s;erious after-reflection or
<PB N="46" REF="46">
thought to inform him he had acted wrong in his deportment, manners, and behaviour to Mr. Gar|rick: He knew Garrick's great fortune, and his own <HI>no fortune at all,</HI> but allowed no profe&s;&s;ional &s;uperiority in talents, &amp;c.; and when he &s;poke to Mr. Garrick, he &s;aid, he of cour&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed that Mr. Garrick knew he was &s;peaking to as good a gentleman as him&s;elf, and an actor on much the &s;ame footing of merit: For the bravos and encou|ragement he received in his be&s;t days at York were certainly flattering; and from tho&s;e cau&s;es, combined with his own &s;elf-opinion, had con|firmed to him that he was &s;ecure of the highe&s;t opinion from all the nobility of England, becau&s;e a few &s;aw him in a York race-week. With Rich he met with a very different reception from that of the Drury Lane patentee: He found him teach|ing a young lady to act, with three or four cats about him. After his being &s;ome time in the room, when announced, Rich viewed him through a very large reading-gla&s;s, took his &s;nuff, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Well, Mr. Frog&s;mire, I &s;uppo&s;e you are come from York to be taught, and that I &s;hould give you an engagement: Did you ever act Richard, Mr. Frog&s;mire?"&mdash;"Yes, Sir."&mdash;"Why then you &s;hall hear me act,"</Q> &s;ays Rich:&mdash;when he &s;poke a &s;peech in a mo&s;t ridiculous manner: And on its being concluded, Frod&s;ham petti&s;hly told him he
<PB N="47" REF="47">
did not vi&s;it him nor come from York to be taught nor to hear him act; he came (like Lord Chalk&s;tone) merely for a little conver&s;ation, and to view his Ely&s;ian fields. But as Mr. Rich loved lei&s;ure, and had little curio&s;ity, he replied, that un|le&s;s <HI>Mu&s;ter</HI> Frog&s;mire would with humble atten|tion hear his Richard, he would not hear Mr. Frog&s;mire at all.

<P>I will here take it for granted, that the reader has ruminated on giddy Frod&s;ham's exit from the world's &s;tage, and once more re&s;ume my di&s;cour&s;e to inform the peru&s;er, that during my few days retire|ment at Mr. Baker's, after the races, I received the fa|vour of an invitation from Mr. Whitely, director of the Donca&s;ter theatre, reque&s;ting I would per|form a few nights there after the races, as him|&s;elf and troop were to attend that meeting, and continue &s;ome weeks afterwards. The offer exactly tallied with my plan for convenience, as it filled up the &s;pace until I &s;hould be wanted at Hull, and al&s;o would add gri&s;t to my mill. I conti|nued with good Mr. Baker at my hou&s;e (or rather his) at York, till I went to Donca&s;ter, and he &s;tayed with me till then, out of compliment, for he u&s;ually was with the company. I went, and Mr. Whitely gave bills with a long puff of <Q REND="inline">"Walk in and &s;ee the wonderful great actor he had engaged
<PB N="49" REF="49">
from London, Dublin, Edinburgh, &amp;c."</Q> I acted there three weeks. Mi&s;s Whitely was the young heroine, a very pretty and hand&s;ome young lady; &s;he promi&s;ed well as an actre&s;s, but thank her &s;tars &s;he is much better provided for than being obliged to rely on the &s;tage. She married Mr. Go&s;lin of Stamford, where &s;he is happily &s;ituated, and is ju&s;t as irre&s;i&s;tible a woman now as &s;he was a girl then. During my continuance at Donca|&s;ter I lived entirely with Mr. Stanuel, who at that time kept the Green Dragon, and to who&s;e civi|lities I was greatly indebted and have never for|got; and I am glad of this public opportunity to ac|knowledge them, and pre&s;ent my thanks to him. Mr. Stanuel now moves on a larger &s;cale, and in a more exalted &s;phere, as he is ma&s;ter of an ele|gant and much improved inn, well known (and genteelly &s;upported) under the name of the Red Lion.</P>
<P>My benefit play there was the Merchant of Ve|nice; my Tea, and Duke and no Duke. It was particularly honoured, with not only being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ry full, but all the genteel families came on that occa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">on to our little theatre; and no wonder, for be&s;ides the compliment paid to me, Sir George Cooke's mother (who was much beloved by all the families in Donca&s;ter and its neighbourhood) did me the honour una&s;ked to patronize my play. Sir George Cooke lives at Wheatly, near Donca|&s;ter:
<PB N="50" REF="50">
His own lady inherits every virtue and en|dearing quality, which demands and receives uni|ver&s;al re&s;pect, e&s;teem, and admiration.</P>
<P>I returned back to York, and then po&s;ted next day for Beverley, where my friend Mr. Baker waited for me, and after that ceremony e&s;corted me to Hull, which was early in the month of No|vember, 1765.&mdash;My fir&s;t appearance was in King Lear. I had every rea&s;on to be plea&s;ed, not only from the attention and warm applau&s;e of the au|dience, but from the civilities paid me by &s;everal of the leading inhabitants.

The comedians had particular rea|&s;ons to jump for joy, as they received the &s;ame be|nefit emoluments, without tho&s;e degrading and irk|&s;ome &s;ituations, which intere&s;t had made them &s;ub|mit to. The Covent-Garden managers adopted the &s;ame change of mea&s;ures, and from that time general admittance and &s;tage building, on bene|fits, has ever been prohibited.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;tage remarks have carried my me|mory back to recollect that the &s;ame evils ex|i&s;ted in provincial theatres, and in a wor&s;e de|gree; as tho&s;e &s;tages (not being formed into an amphitheatre) were without any order or decen|cy, merely rows of forms, one level with the other: for the audience part of tho&s;e theatres were full large for their u&s;ual &s;ea&s;ons of acting; yet on particular benefits, London furni&s;hed a plea for what might be attempted to render the bad playhou&s;es wor&s;e than they were before. And the alterations in this re&s;pect, from Mr. Garrick's reformation of abu&s;es in London, I &s;hould ap|prehend

led into the &s;udden wonderful improve|ments, enlargements, and aggrandizing of mo&s;t of our theatres in every principal town and city.</P>
<P>And as to the article of being freed from beaux behind the &s;cenes, a greater ble&s;&s;ing could not be wi&s;hed or more devoutly prayed for; as it cannot be conceived how dreadful in the country that would &s;ometimes prove, (my own &s;ituation in my hi&s;tory mentioned at Shrew&s;bury, is one in&s;tance) the hauteur and dignity of &s;uch vi&s;itants being often &s;o in&s;ulting and imperious as not to be de|&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The receipts of the theatres, it is true, &s;hould be mentioned. In 1750, two hundred pounds be|fore the curtain, at Covent-Garden, was judged an amazing &s;um. Now, we hear of upwards of four hundred pounds; but the profits of the &s;ea|&s;on I dare pronounce are not equal to Mr. Gar|rick's reign, the expences are grown &s;o enormous.</P>
<P>At Dublin, in 1757, one hundred and fifty pounds was a great hou&s;e indeed. In 1763, one hundred and eighty pounds at Crow-Street was ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ged a wonder: but with the late alterations, Mr. Daly had, in July 179<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, three hundred and twenty-four pounds; and he mentions hundreds that could not obtain admittance.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="123">
Mr. Garrick was certainly formed to obtain fa|vour:&mdash;and the public, in general, willingly &s;ub|&s;cribed to his propo&s;als (though like man and wife they &s;ometimes did not agree):&mdash;His coffers were always full, and he was too great an oeconomi&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ver to empty them by the hand of extravagance:&mdash;he locked on his Maje&s;ty's picture with love and reverence, and never parted with his King's likene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s but with the greate&s;t relu ance.&mdash;The expences of the hou&s;e were not then &s;o great as at pre&s;ent; for when I had a benefit at Covent Garden, 1760, I only paid 60l.; now I believe performers pay 120l.; and if Mrs. Jordan acts on that benefit, it is ten guineas more.</P>
<P>It is worthy remark, that with all the boa&s;ted im|provements, certainly the goings out are immen&s;e in proportion to the comings in; and where there was one place open again&s;t the theatres then, now there are double&mdash;&s;uch as various new-e&s;tabli&s;hed con|certs at Hanover-Square, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ottenham-Court, Pan|theon, be&s;ides A&s;tley's, the Circus, &amp;c. therefore, with the London managers being at double the expence of their predece&s;&s;ors, I can never coin|cide with the opinions &s;tarted by di&s;&s;atisfied per|formers, or as o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ten hinted at in the news papers.

But his Farmer's Re|turn, Linco's Travels, &amp;c. wrote as interludes, have con&s;iderably le&s;&s;ened the dignity of the drama. It was the practice at my own theatres: I at fir&s;t, on benefit nights, in&s;i&s;ted on all inter|ludes being done as afterludes, but nothing would do, &s;o as to keep the play-bills <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">it to be &s;een, they were &s;o loaded with trumpe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y: &s;o for &s;ome years pa&s;t I have not had any preludes, interludes, or afterludes at all.

<P>Mr. Garrick's e&s;tabli&s;hment, as joint manager with Mr. Lacey, was in 1747, and few per&s;ons who have been readers of theatrical anecdotes have y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t, &s;ince the time of Colley Cibber, had any accurate or regular account of tho&s;e years more than in a general view, though there certainly has been able writers and men of genius who have treated on more important theatrical &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>I will here give a li&s;t of the companies at Drury-Lane and Covent-Garden in 1747, that the ob&s;ervant reader, unprejudiced, may &s;ee what a number of e&s;tabli&s;hed actors were at that period in one company, and whether there are the &s;ame number of <HI>equal eminence</HI> to be called &s;o at pre&s;ent at either Theatre.</P>
<P>The modern critic and actor will undoubtedly admit that every fifty years will make havock and con&s;iderable alteration, and what is approved and applauded now, 1790, may not be &s;anctioned in 184<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.&mdash;When Mr. Garrick undertook the ma|na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ement, the company collected, was perhaps, take it for all in all, the mo&s;t powerful ever mu&s;tered in the pre&s;ent century.</P>

<P>Mrs. Cibber did not play. That &s;ea&s;on Mr. Garrick (&s;hameful to relate) encouraged Mrs. Ward to break articles with Mr Rich, which &s;he was the ea&s;ier tempted to do, as Mi&s;s Bellamy was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of mo&s;t of the characters &s;he wi&s;hed to play. Edward the Black Prince was acted that &s;ea&s;on&mdash;Barry gained great ground and honour in Ribemont.

<P>Mrs. Cibber having withdrawn was a &s;evere &s;troke upon the Drury Lane tragedies, Mrs. Ward being but a cold and inanimate &s;ub&s;titute; and it fell heavier on Mr. Barry's plays than Mr. Garrick's, as Lear, Macbeth, Richard, with Mrs. Pritchard's Lady Macbeth, &amp;c. would do without Mrs. Cibber; but Ca&s;talio, Romeo, Varanes, &amp;c. were ruined without her helping hand: Indeed Barry refu&s;ed acting Romeo with Mrs. Ward. The Roman Father was brought out that &s;ea&s;on, where Barry in Publius by no means could appear as an actor (though it &s;hewed his fine figure) in competition with Garrick. Gil Blas was produced that year and damned, and &s;ome other pieces, but none of note. Rich not having any thing new, and only repeating the old plays, Lady Jane Gray excepted and the pantomime of the Fair, Drury Lane, unle&s;s on particular nights, bore the beil. Garrick's comedy characters, as well as his tragedy, (&s;uch as Ranger, Benedick,

<P>COVENT GARDEN, 1749-50.</P>
<P>The company much the &s;ame as the year be|fore, unle&s;s the lo&s;s of Mr. Theophilus Cibber: Mr. Dyer from Ireland was his &s;ub&s;titute, a very good actor in &s;prightly comedy; not &s;triking as to abilities, but &s;ure to plea&s;e, and never to offend. He played &s;everal parts of Mr. Garrick's, &s;uch as Ranger, &amp;c. and in Tom was truly excellent;&mdash;that was his fir&s;t part at Covent. Garden. Mr. Dyer's figure was very neat, not unlike that of Mr. Lewis's of Covent Garden; but it would be paying Mr. Lewis a very bad complement to draw a compari&s;on in any other re&s;pect, as that gentleman's vivacity, neatne&s;s, &s;pirit, and energy of expre&s;&s;ion, is &s;o &s;uperior as to ca&s;t Mr. Dyer's abilities at a di&s;tance, were he now living; as wherever Mr. Lewis's Vapid, Twineall, Mercutio, &amp;c. are men|t oned, which he &s;upports with a peculiar whim and vivacity, he by that means &s;ends hundreds joyful to their re&s;pective homes: In truth he needs no eulogium, as the true&s;t prai&s;e is de&s;ervedly thus, that whether Mr. Lewis had plea&s;ed the audience in 1700, 1790, or in 1810, he would have an equal claim to the genero&s;ity, pro|tection,

That year Mr. Rich produced a little &s;ketch of a pantomime called the Fair, in which Mr. Lun (Rich) did Harlequin.

When Barry acted Othello, Macklin played Iago: And when Quin acted Othello, Ryan was the Iago.&mdash;I wonder Quin's under&s;tanding would let him per&s;i&s;t in acting Othello, where he was &s;o inferior in every re&s;pect to Mr. Barry.

<P>Mr. Barry and Mrs. Cibber were in high e&s;ti|mation, and to particular plays drew good hou&s;es. But, unle&s;s to a pantomime, or &s;omething of par|ticular attraction, the boxes were often very thin at the early part of the &s;ea&s;on; whereas Drury-Lane was con&s;tantly attended.&mdash;Thin boxes on any night was &s;eldom &s;een there; as a neatne&s;s, deco|rum, and regularity, pervaded the whole.

Mr. Giffard, junior, made his appearance in Lear, a very improper character; the play was wretchedly acted, when compared with the performance of the &s;ame piece at the rival theatre;&mdash;or indeed with|out any compari&s;on at all.&mdash;Signor Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ane&s;i, and Signora Bugiani, were that &s;ea&s;on engaged; two inimitable dancers: the lady's countenance was the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive and &s;trong that can be imagined.

Mi&s;s Bellamy returned here from Drury Lane; but the relation in her book, relative to that matter, being far from authentic, for the &s;ake of theatrical truth and hi&s;tory I give the following accounts: Thus far indeed &s;he acknowledges, viz. <Q REND="inline">"The frequent mi&s;takes which I find I have made in the chronology of my Theatrical Anecdotes, will, I hope, be imputed to my reciting them, as I have already ob&s;erved, entirely from memory; and the deviation, I tru&s;t, will be excu&s;ed by my readers, as the incidents them&s;elves, though perhaps er|roneous in point of time, are real facts.

<P>As <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ate Wilkin&s;on I here note, that Con&s;tantine was acted that &s;ea&s;on, and &s;hared an unhappy fate.

After the third act it grew very languid, and the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rtain dropped, with the audience more fatigued than enraged.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Bellamy mu&s;t have been determinably wrong as to her account of Con&s;tantine being damned the fir&s;t night of repre&s;entation: It was fir&s;t acted on Saturday, February 23, 1754; al&s;o on the Monday and Tue&s;day following: The third <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ght, as u&s;ual, for the benefit of the author; but the play was unfortunately &s;o ill attended and di&s;|approved, that it was again put up on Thur&s;day, February 28, the fourth night, for the benefit o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the author.&mdash;The following in&s;ertion was at the bottom of the bill:&mdash;.</P>

<PB N="184" REF="181">
&s;ome time, as that tragedy was with difficulty hur|ried thro', the Empre&s;s Fulvia being brought to bed that very fourth night, and like a woman of &s;pirit &s;he appeared &s;oon after in the penitent Jane Shore for her own benefit: Mr. Foote acted in the Knights that &s;aid evening, and gave an imitation of Mr. Garrick in the prologue, who had wrote and &s;poke that &s;ea&s;on the following lines:&mdash; <Q><L>I read no Greek, Sir&mdash;When I was at &s;chool</L>
<L>Terence wrote prologues&mdash;Terence was no fool.</L></Q>
Which lines Foote thus ridiculed, and in manner very like the Garrick, and with effect:&mdash;<Q><L>I read no Greek, Sir&mdash;When I was at &s;chool</L>
<L>The u&s;her wrote prologues&mdash;the u&s;her was no fool.</L></Q></P>
<P>Mi&s;s Bellamy mentions al&s;o the great expence Mr. Rich was at in reviving Bu&s;irus, which is a dream of her own invention, as Mr. Barry revived that play Monday, March 22, 1756, for his own benefit, two years LATER than her account, and was acted to a very indifferent hou&s;e. The &s;tage was built, but the &s;eats were empty. Mr. Foote acted Hartop in the Knights that evening, to oblige and &s;erve Mr Barry.</P>
<P>Mrs. Bellamy al&s;o relates, that on her return to Covent Garden, on her appearing in Juliet with Barry, that the tragedy had a run exceeding
<PB N="185" REF="182">
that of oppo&s;ition 1750. It is &s;o little connected with truth, and is &s;o very erroneous, that on the contrary, when &s;he returned to Covent Garden on the &s;ea&s;on's opening in the autumn 1754, Mi&s;s No&s;&s;iter was, as before-mentioned in my Memoirs, the Juliet; which character Mi&s;s Bel|lamy at that time never had acted with Mr. Bar|ry, nor ever did till &s;o late as the 26th of Decem|ber 1755. Her fir&s;t appearance in 1753, on her return, was on Tue&s;day the 20th of November, in a very improper character; as was her &s;econd on Thur&s;day, November 22 (her &s;ituation con|&s;idered): She was thus announced in the bills, <Q REND="inline">"Athenais, by Mi&s;s Bellamy, her fir&s;t appearance this &s;tage the&s;e three years."</Q> After the cha&s;te Athenais, the pure Monimia followed, which led to &s;trange ideas that Ca&s;talio mo&s;t certainly had been acquainted with that lady long before the third act. After that &s;ea&s;on (and not before it was nece&s;&s;ary) &s;he wi&s;ely changed the appellation of <HI>Mi&s;s</HI> to <HI>Mrs.</HI> Bellamy.</P>
<P>That lady's life being publi&s;hed, my own re|marks, and intimacy with her as an acquaint|ance, friend, and actre&s;s, will not, I hope, make the following genuine letters unexceptionable, as it draws as near to the fini&s;h of that once admired

were the de&s;perate undertakers after Sheridan's abdication.&mdash;Mi&s;s No&s;&s;iter, (Mr. Barry's favourite Juliet) made a point of having five hundred pounds; and Mrs. Gregory (who had only appeared in two characters the winter before, at Covent-Garden; once in Hermione, and in Alicia twice; once for Mr. Sparks, and another night for Mrs. Bellamy), at three hundred pounds.&mdash;Barry on his departure from England denounced ruin on Mr. Rich by his de&s;ertion; but &s;uch threats were weak in the extreme: It is true, Mr. Sheridan's Romeo was vain and ridiculous, immediately af|ter Barry's; but Barry forgot that with the aid and n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">velty of new performers, and Mr. Rich's never|failing &s;upport, pantomime, and with a theatre in London, (where the metropolis can pour in &s;uch incredible numbers) it mu&s;t be the manager's own fault indeed, if he be ruined by the lo&s;s of any per|former whatever.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan, by the great riot in Dublin, be|ing obliged to leave that city, occa&s;ioned by the repre&s;entation of Mahomet in February 1754; in which perturbation Mrs. Woffington was &s;uppo|&s;ed to have aided, as a party concerned in <HI>real</HI> &s;tate politics, which certainly has not any con|nection or bu&s;ine&s;s within the walls of a theatre, that lady was al&s;o obliged to retire from Ireland, at the &s;ame time, with Mr. Sheridan.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="201">
It is one of the mo&s;t remarkable riots that ever occurred in any theatre, and well worthy of being read by every admirer of theatrical hi&s;tory. It would be impertinent to introduce it here, as it mu&s;t be well known, or &s;hould be, to all theatrical per&s;ons. Tho&s;e who have not been made ac|quainted with that period of the early part of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Iri&s;h &s;tage, will find it all fully ex|plained in a modern volume lately printed, by Mr. Hitchcock; a gentleman of great ability and integrity of the Dublin theatre:&mdash;It gives a general view of the Iri&s;h theatre, from its commencement, down to the year 1757, and will well repay the trouble of a little attention. I can an&s;wer, as for my&s;elf, that I often take Mr. Hitch|cock's book up for information.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan this year came over, and was en|gaged by Mr. Rich in the autumn 1754. The &s;ea&s;on opened with &s;ome of Mr. Rich's &s;tock co|medies, very ill acted indeed, and as dingily dre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>October 11, 1754, Mrs. Green made her ap|pearance from Dublin, in the character of Lappet; a good comic actre&s;s&mdash;much the be&s;t in chamber|maids, Mrs. Heidelbergs, &amp;c. &s;ince the time of Mrs. Clive.</P>
<P>On Friday, October 18, 1754, Othello was announced, with an occa&s;ional prologue, &s;poke by Mrs. Hamilton, for the introducing Mr. Mur|phy.
<PB N="205" REF="202">
(A gentleman well known and admired for his talents as an author, and many very re&s;pectable qualities; and often mentioned in the cour&s;e of my Memoirs.) He was to appear in the difficult and dangerous part of Othello; rendered at that time more hazardous than the pre&s;ent, by the well known excellence of Mr. Barry in that cha|racter. Mr. Murphy had many other rea&s;ons to be alarmed; as he had long waged his pen of war as author of the Gray's-Inn Journal, and had been the terror of poets, and the &s;courge of players.</P>
<P>The novelty held out was a charm irre&s;i&s;tible to attend Covent-Garden theatre.&mdash;Mr. Murphy's judgment, then or now, would be ab&s;urd to call in que&s;tion; and I hold that gentleman in true regard; but on the &s;tage, he certainly wanted, what we behind the &s;cenes call powers, &amp;c. <HI>for great effect.</HI></P>
<P>After that gentleman's novelty of three nights, on Tue&s;day, October the twenty-fir&s;t, the Nonjuror was adverti&s;ed.&mdash;Doctor Wolf, Mr. Cibber (his fir&s;t appearance for four years); and Maria, Mrs. Woffington (her fir&s;t appearance for three years); which drew a great hou&s;e.&mdash;So favourite an actre&s;s, and &s;o well acquainted with per&s;ons in higher life, will ea&s;ily gain credit to my account. She was of cour&s;e greatly received, and played that character as well as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> could be played.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="203">
On Wedne&s;day the 23d of October, Mr. She|ridan made his fir&s;t appearance in his e&s;teemed character of Hamlet: Judicious without doubt; but when compared to the combined excellencies of a Garrick, and the plea&s;ing powers of the win|ning Barry, he was not by any means e&s;tabli&s;hed from that night's performance as a darling of the London audience&mdash;Tho' in Dublin not any one performer whatever, even the Garrick, at that time would not have been univer&s;ally crowned with lau|rel, as to preference, or perhaps equality; but (as Mr. Macklin has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d) that opinion had been jerked into the Iri&s;h audience from his father Dr. She|ridan the &s;choolma&s;ter. He next appeared in Ri|chard, without any remarkable applau&s;e till the dying &s;cene, where he was equal to any actor, if not &s;uperior to any I had then, or have &s;ince &s;een, without the aid of a flounder-like flouncing, as the modern Richard's practice, to the great plea|&s;ure, approbation, and univer&s;al plaudits from the <HI>galleries.</HI> Till I broke my leg I was much at|tached to that tumb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ing exhibition and &s;urpri&s;ing feat-like agility.</P>
<P>In November, 1754, Phaedra and Hippolitus was revived:&mdash;The&s;eus, Sheridan; Hippolitus, Smith; Phaedra, Mrs. Woffington; and had not any farce ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ked to i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, though a play con&s;i&s;ting of five characters only.

plays, and invariable with new ones, not to have any entertainment for the fir&s;t nine or twelve nights&mdash;it would have been judged di&s;graceful: nor did any play whatever intervene, unle&s;s from illne&s;s or an unfore&s;een cau&s;e. Phaedra had not any &s;ucce&s;s that year. Indeed, though the poetry is elegant, it is too learned and too languid. The performers and audience &s;eemed half a&s;leep, and the candles burned dim, unle&s;s at the following pa&s;&s;age; which, with the advantage of Mrs. Wof|fington's figure and new dre&s;s, prepared them for the chace&mdash;<Q><L>Come, let us hunt the &s;tag and chace the foaming boar&punc;</L>

<L>For there, even there Hippolitus will guard me.</L></Q> After which rou&s;e all parties on and off the &s;tage, as by mutual con&s;ent, unanimou&s;ly returned to their evening's nap.</P>
<P>Mr. Moncrife's Appius was acted that &s;ea&s;on, on the &s;ame &s;tory of Virginia, produced the year before by the Rev. Mr. Crofts at Drury-Lane, but de&s;titute of every comparative merit, either as to plot, incident, writing, or any other claim to preference, and as to acting lamentably deficient. One &s;peech of Mr. Sheridan's (though I never &s;aw the play but the fir&s;t night out of the &s;ix i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">

<L>I thir&s;t, I thir&s;t for blood&mdash;for blood of Appius.</L></Q></P>
<P>Coriolanus was revived with great pomp:&mdash;Mr. Sheridan conveyed a ma&s;terly knowledge of the character and his immortal author, old Shak|&s;peare. That play drew &s;everal hou&s;es; but his OEdipus, Romeo, Zanga, Lord Townly, Sir Charles Ea&s;y, O&s;myn, &amp;c. did not bear equal credit. Italian burlettas were attempted by a new &s;et of Italians, but met with very little attraction or applau&s;e:&mdash;The fir&s;t was L'Arcadia in Brenta, on Monday the 18th of November 1754; the &s;econd, entitled, La Famiglia de Bertoldi. Mr. Murphy performed Jaffier only between his fir&s;t appearance and the benefits in March, when he acted Archer, Young Bevil, Hamlet, Macbeth, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Mr. Clarke made his fir&s;t appearance that &s;ea|&s;on in O&s;man in Zara, on Thur&s;day the 30th of October; an actor that mu&s;t be at this time well remembered by his brethren and the public, tho' his talents were not &s;trong enough to let him live long after death.</P>
<P>A Mrs. Glen al&s;o made her appearance that year in Rutland, Monday, February 24, 1756.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am right as to the dates of the month, &amp;c. but Mr. Clarke and Mrs. Glen's appearances were in Octo|ber, 1755; Mrs. Glen's in February, 1756.</NOTE>&mdash;

<P>Mr. Rich revived Orpheus and Eurydice, that &s;ea&s;on, Wedne&s;day, January 29, which drew crowds, but not equal to the Sorcerer, nor held in great e&s;timation. That pantomime has been tried twice or thrice &s;ince then, but without &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Poitier (an excellent dancer indeed) wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> introduced that year, and greatly admired: He came from the Opera Hou&s;e at Paris; his fir&s;t ap|pearance was on Tue&s;day, Dec. 3, 1754.&mdash;I do not recollect any very particular incidents that &s;ea&s;on.&mdash;Mrs Bellamy revived Alzira for her benefit&mdash;Za|mor, Mr. Murphy: and the &s;ea&s;on concluded on Thur&s;day, May 22, with the Con&s;tant Couple; Sir Harry, of cour&s;e, by Mrs. Woffington; the entertainment was Orpheus and Eurydice.</P>
<P>DRURY-LANE, 1755-6.</P>
<P>Mr. Mo&s;&s;op was this year enticed (partly ow|ing to an affront mentioned in my Memoirs) over to Dublin, by Mr. Victor and Mr. Sowden, to play on &s;hares and two benefits; where he only
<PB N="210" REF="207">
acted twenty-four nights, finding he could obtain more profit for him&s;elf by acting twenty than forty nights for his employers:&mdash;So in fact Mr. Mo&s;|&s;op's great drawings <HI>in,</HI> was on the other nights the inevitable occa&s;ion of great drawings <HI>out</HI> from the trea&s;ury of that theatre. Mr. Garrick, from the unexpected lo&s;s of Mo&s;&s;op, engaged Mr. Murphy to &s;upply that bulwark the other's ab&s;ence had oc|ca&s;ioned to give way. Mr. Murphy's fir&s;t ap|pearance was on Tue&s;day the 30th of September, 1756, in O&s;myn in the Mourning Bride. Mr. Holland &s;tarted forth in the month of October, (Monday the 13th, 1755) in the character of Oroonoko, &s;upported by Mrs. Cibber in Imoinda. He was a &s;hining ornament, and an hone&s;t, truly agreeable man, was univer&s;ally beloved, but death &s;natched him in the bloom of life and improve|ment, and deprived the &s;tage of an actor of merit and a worthy character.&mdash;He was too apt to <HI>out-herod</HI> Herod&mdash;by which fal&s;e judg|ment (mi&s;taking it for genuine fire) the big man|ly voice became too often har&s;h and unplea&s;ing.

it is, would we once con&s;ider, that the opinions of the principal leaders of fa&s;hion in every place will influence the million in a great mea&s;ure, and by them will be allowed, followed, and adopted. The following lines on this &s;ubject were wrote on Holland:&mdash;<Q><LG>
<L>When GARRICK, by whatever motive led,</L>

<L>Griev'd, for I knew the players of the age,</L>

<L>No more, &s;aid I, o'erleaping vulgar awe,</L>

<L>Catching the &s;pirit with the poet caught,</L>

<P>Athel&s;tan was produced that year, written by Doctor Brown. Mr. Garrick did his very be&s;t to &s;upport it, and the play certainly had merit,
<PB N="212" REF="209">
and was well acted; but it never recovered the chilne&s;s of the &s;pring, nor has ever taken root, budded or flowered, from that time to this.</P>
<P>The Winter's Tale, introduced with an excel|lent prologue by Mr. Garrick, had a very con&s;i|derable run. Mrs. Cibber's neat &s;implicity in &s;inging the &s;ong wrote by Mr. Garrick&mdash;
<Q><L>Come, come, my good &s;hepherds, our flocks we mu&s;t &s;hear, &amp;c.</L></Q>
made little Perditta appear of the greate&s;t con&s;e|quence.&mdash;It was well ca&s;t, and the performance ju&s;tified Mr. Garrick's judgment in &s;o ordering the characters. Catherine and Petrucio was altered into three acts on the &s;ame occa&s;ion: Petrucio, Mr. Woodward; Catherine, Mrs. Clive.&mdash;He threw her down on the exit of the &s;econd act, which had very near convinced the audience that Petrucio was not &s;o lordly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s he a&s;&s;umed; for Mrs. Clive was &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> enraged at her fall, that her talons, tongue, and pa&s;&s;ion, wer every expre&s;&s;ive to the eyes of all beholders, and it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty Kate &s;uppre&s;&s;ed her indignation.&mdash;The fir&s;t re|pre&s;entation of the&s;e pieces was on the 21&s;t of January 1756.</P>
<P>The Apprentice was introduced that year, Ja|nuary, 2d by Mr. Murphy; who &s;poke a pro|logue to that farce, which was afterwards inimi|tably
<PB N="213" REF="210">
and con&s;tantly repeated by Mr. Woodward in the character of Dick, in which part he was excellent. The farce had a great run, and &s;till continues in full effect, and ever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ill, while a cle|ver &s;pirited comedian like Mr. Lewis or Mr. Bani&s;ter, jun. has the Apprentice intru&s;ted to his care and guardian&s;hip.</P>
<P>The Tempe&s;t as an opera in three acts, with recitative, &amp;c. was introduced that &s;ea&s;on, with a paltry dialogue, as may be &s;een in the magazine, of Feb. 1756: Signora Curioni, an Italian &s;inger, performed in it, but it was dreadfully heavy.&mdash;It went through with great labour eight nights, but not without the aid of the garland dance, well performed by &s;ixty children, at the end of the &s;e|cond act, and the pantomine of Fortunatus, or the Genii, after that.</P>
<P>All's Well that Ends Well was revived&mdash;I imagine to plea&s;e Woodward, who was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ond of acting Parolies.&mdash;He revived that play at Dub|lin, and al&s;o when la&s;t at Covent Garden; but I never remember any remarkable &s;ucce&s;s or plea|&s;ure received from the repre&s;entation of that play; though here and there, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, there are &s;cenes of merit, whim&s;icality, and genius: but it never will be like the ma&s;ter productions of Shak&s;peare, a &s;tanding di&s;h or an alluring &s;pec|tacle to the public eye.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="211">
The Fair Quaker was al&s;o revived that winter, and was well acted, but the comedy of it&s;elf has not much &s;terling merit, and its humour and the characters are too coar&s;e for the nice di&s;crimination of the pre&s;ent age. However, Mr. Garrick made the play &s;tand its ground from the good acting of Woodward, and Mr. Yates in Beau Mizen and Flip, and the parts in general not a little reinforced by the good and popular pieces the manager added as a &s;upport, and the new &s;ong of <Q REND="inline">"Hearts of oak are our &s;hips,"</Q> by Mr. Beard.</P>

<P>I AM extremely glad I did not an&s;wer your la&s;t letter but one, becau&s;e if I had, it would have deprived me of the &s;atisfaction of knowing that my &s;eeming neglect had vexed you; but it was occa&s;ioned by my going to Aberdeen, where I &s;taid three weeks, &s;aw a fine country, made &s;e|veral agreeable acquaintances, among&s;t whom were the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">arl of Aberdeen, and the Governor of Fort Augu&s;tus,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"though la&s;t not lea&s;t,"</Q>&mdash;and brought home enough to make the pot boil.</P>

<PB N="261" REF="258">
no doubt, your country '&s;quires would be for hor&s;ewhipping the actor that had &s;truck out that natural &s;cene of the grave-diggers.</P>
<P>As to alterations there are few or none, at lea&s;t <HI>additions,</HI> which alone make material alterations. I can therefore tell you, the fir&s;t act being remarkably long, great part of it is carried into the &s;econd:&mdash;and the &s;ending Ham|let to England, and the grave-digging &s;cene, is by that means cut out; and the introducing the &s;cene that has been long omitted, where Ham|let intercepts the officer at the head of a party going to engage the enemy for a bit of land.&mdash;<HI>That</HI> &s;cene re&s;tored, and the divi&s;ion of the fir&s;t act, makes ample amends for what is cut out.</P>
<P>No doubt Hamlet's con&s;enting to go to Eng|land, and being prevented and brought back by a miracle, is altogether ab&s;urd, when his &s;o|lemn engagement with his father's gho&s;t is duly con&s;idered. However, as I have already ob|&s;erved, the million will like, nay, under&s;tand, Shak&s;peare with all his glorious ab&s;urdities, nor &s;uffer a bold invader to cut them up.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR TATE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is now a con&s;iderable time &s;ince I wrote to my good friend Sir John O'Carroll, and in|formed him of all the misfortunes that have happened to my family, and reque&s;ted that he would be &s;o good to let you know of them. As I have received no an&s;wer, I am really very unea&s;y, particularly as I mentioned &s;omething that nearly concerned his intere&s;t: I mu&s;t there|fore reque&s;t that you will inquire about it, and inform me.</P>
<P>I was in France near a year with my wife and Mrs. Forbes, whom I left at Montauban, and got home in June 1775. My poor ne|phew Jack had been a long time ill, and was then at Mallow Waters. Alderman Forbes went to vi&s;it his wife in October la&s;t, but the &s;hip was da&s;hed to pieces in Wales, and he and many others were lo&s;t. In March la&s;t my dear Jack exchanged this life for a better, and was &s;oon followed by his broken-hearted mother, and your good friend my poor brother Ache|&s;on. You may ea&s;ily conceive the di&s;traction of our family. My brother John has been much affected, and my niece Hannah is, I fear; in a dangerous &s;ituation from the immen&s;e fa|tigue &s;he had with her brother and mother.
<PB N="263" REF="260">
My dear &s;i&s;ter Forbes, could not &s;upport her lo&s;s, and la&s;t June &s;he followed her hu&s;band. This is too melancholy a &s;ubject to dwell on. I know you feel for us all. Mrs. Chaigneau and Mrs. Ache&s;on, (who lives with me) and all the remainder of your old friends, de&s;ire to be remembered to you in the kinde&s;t manner, and believe me,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I &s;hould be happy if I could give you the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance relative to the matter you have wrote to me about. I can only &s;peak from me|mory, and my then knowledge of the army.
<PB N="272" REF="269">
I was at that time at Port&s;mouth. Sir Robert Rich's regiment of dragoons, to which I then be|longed, was all 1758 in Scotland, except the light troop, which marched into England on Thurot with his fleet appearing off our northern coa&s;t, and I marched with it, as Lieutenant, in Septem. 1758. I knew Capt. Anthony St. Leger, in the 3d, or King's own regiment of dragoons, who was then at Port&s;mouth with the light troop of that regiment. I am confident there then was not a colonel or lieutenant colonel Thornton belong|ing the hor&s;e at Port&s;mouth, or in the Engli&s;h &s;ervice at that time. If I recollect right there was only one field officer appointed to command the light troops upon the expedition that went out that &s;ummer again&s;t Cherbourg, which was Ma|jor George Warde, of the 11th dragoons, now Lieutenant General Warde. In 1758 every re|giment of heavy dragoons had a light troop be|longing to it, which were detached corps in order to be &s;ent upon tho&s;e expeditions; &s;o that each troop had only a captain, lieutenant, and cornet &s;ent with it.</P>
<P>You are mi&s;taken with regard to the rank of the gentleman you mention. There was at that time a <HI>Lieut. William Thornton</HI> of the 7th dragoons, who was there, and went upon the expedition; he was a man univer&s;ally known and beloved by
<PB N="273" REF="270">
every body who knew him: He had lived much in the world, was very much of a gentleman, and very &s;en&s;ible, but was rather partial to his bottle.&mdash;I wi&s;h to be as particular as po&s;&s;ible, as I think he was the per&s;on you mean. He was about thirty years of age, about five feet eight inches high, hand&s;ome face, and well made.&mdash;There was a circum&s;tance happened upon that expedition. Captain Lind&s;ay of the 11th dragoons was killed; and General Bligh, who commanded upon the expedition, and had power given him by his Maje&s;ty to fill all va|cancies that &s;hould happen in the army, ap|pointed <HI>Lieutenant William Thornton</HI> to a troop in the 10th dragoons, which he commanded till they returned to Port&s;mouth, where Lord New|bottle, now Marquis of Lothian, came to com|mand the troop, being appointed to it by his Maje&s;ty; the 10th dragoons being then his fa|ther's, Lord Ancram's, regiment.&mdash;The cir|cum&s;tance was much talked of in the army, as Thornton would not return to his former regi|ment or rank.&mdash;The latter end of that year we had in our regiment a captain who died, and Thornton was appointed captain in his room. Thornton died in London in 1765. I remember Captain St. Leger, (afterwards Major General St. Leger), was very intimate with Thornton.&mdash;
