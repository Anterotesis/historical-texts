<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>AS none of the liberal &s;ciences can afford a nobler entertainment to the human mind than poetry, &s;o it is pre&s;umed, that a judicious collection of agreeable and in&s;tructive poems can never be un&s;ea&s;onable. Mu&s;ic ravi&s;hes the ear, and affects the &s;oul; but its &s;weet enchantment is of &s;hort duration: A fine piece of painting, if carefully pre&s;erved, will mellow into perfection, and perhaps continue the admiration of mankind for &s;ome centuries; but the works of THE POET live for ever. We mu&s;t, however, except tho&s;e pieces, which, though intrin&s;ically of the highe&s;t merit, yet, being publi&s;hed in a loo&s;e, carele&s;s, or in|elegant manner, mu&s;t of cour&s;e, in a &s;hort time, peri&s;h in the wreck of oblivion. To pre&s;erve &s;ome of the&s;e &s;pirited productions, which have been thus unfortunately neglected, is one part of the de&s;ign of this publication. But it will be proper briefly to inform the reader of the nature of our plan. Fir&s;t then, we propo&s;e once a month (for one year only) to publi&s;h a &s;mall volume of poems, printed in an elegant manner; each of which will take its title from the month at the conclu&s;ion of which it is publi&s;hed, and be introduced with &s;ome ori|ginal poems, particularly de&s;criptive of its proper
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
month: afterwards will be added variety of pieces that are either amu&s;ing or in&s;tructive (and at the &s;ame time not immoral), which, though of real merit, have pa&s;&s;ed through the world unnoticed:
<Q><L>Full many a flower is born to blu&s;h un&s;een,</L>
<L>And wa&s;te its &s;weetne&s;s on the de&s;ert air.</L></Q></P>
<P>Though it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that our plan is of an exten&s;ive nature, yet we do not in the lea&s;t de&s;pair of bringing it to a con&s;iderable degree of perfection; as we have laid in a very large fund of &s;carce and valuable poems, are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of many original pieces, and have the promi&s;e of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from gentlemen of the mo&s;t celebrated names, the mo&s;t acknowledged ta&s;te, and the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed genius.</P>

<P>Cae&s;ar, having re&s;olved to give battle to Petreius and Afranius, Pompey's lieutenants in Spain, encamped near the enemy in the &s;ame field. The behaviour of their &s;oldiers, at their &s;eeing and knowing one another, is the &s;ubject of the following ver&s;es.</P>

<L>For vent ten thou&s;and &s;truggling pa&s;&s;ions move,</L>

<L>All order broken, wide their arms they throw,</L>

<L>There an old friend recalls his comrade's name,</L>
<L><PB N="53" REF="59">Youths, who in arts beneath one tutor grew,</L>
<L>Rome rent in twain, and kindred ho&s;ts they view.</L>
<L>Tears wet their impious arms, a fond relief,</L>
<L>And ki&s;&s;es, broke by &s;obs, the words of grief;</L>
<L>Tho' yet no blood was &s;pilt, each anxious mind</L>
<L>With horror thinks on what his rage de&s;ign'd.</L>
<L>Ah! generous youths, why thus, with fruitle&s;s pain,</L>

<L>Your generals, left by you, will love again,</L>

<L>Such is the will of fate, and &s;uch the hard decree.</L>
<L><PB N="54" REF="60">'Twas peace. From either camp, now void of fear,</L>

<L>Around the fire they talk; one &s;hows his &s;cars,</L>
<L>One tells what chance fir&s;t led him to the wars;</L>
<L>Their &s;tories o'er the tedious night prevail,</L>
<L>And the mute circle li&s;tens to the tale.</L>
<L>They own they fought, but &s;wear they ne'er could hate</L>
<L>Deny their guilt, and lay the blame on fate;</L>
<L>Their love revives, to make them guiltier grow,</L>
<L>A &s;hort-liv'd ble&s;&s;ing, but to heighten woe.</L>
<L>When to Petreius fir&s;t the news was told,</L>

<L>He ended fierce. The &s;oldier's rage returns,</L>
<L>His blood flies upward, and his bo&s;om burns.</L>
