<P> An allu&s;ion to <HI>ridens moriar,</HI> the clo&s;e of the celebrated Northern Ode, by the Dani&s;h king Regner Lodbrog; a tran&s;lation of which is in&s;ert|ed in the curious little volume of Runic poetry, printed for Dod&s;ley, 1763.</P>
<P>Bartholin, in his admirable E&s;&s;ay on the Cau&s;es which in&s;pired the Danes with a Contempt of Death, affirms, that it was cu&s;tomary with the

Northern warriors to &s;ing their own exploits in the clo&s;e of life. He mentions the example of a hero, named Hallmundus, who being mortally wounded, commanded his daughter to attend while he compo&s;ed a poem, and to in&s;cribe it on a tablet of wood. <BIBL>BARTHOLIN. Lib. i. cap. 10.</BIBL></P>

<P>The poetry of Provence contains many &s;pirited &s;atires again&s;t the enormities of the Clergy. The mo&s;t remarkable, is the bold invective of the Trouba|dour Guillaume Figueira, in which he execrates the avarice and the cruelty of Rome. The Papal cau&s;e found a female Poet to defend it: Ger|monda of Montpellier compo&s;ed a poetical reply to the &s;atire of Figueira. <BIBL>See MILLOT's Hi&s;t. des Troubadours, vol. ii. p. 455.</BIBL></P>

<P>There never was a century utterly de&s;titute of inge|nious and elegant Poets, &s;ays the learned Po|lycarp Lei&s;er, after having patiently traced the ob&s;cure progre&s;s of Latin poetry through all the
<PB N="5" REF="6">
dark ages. Indeed the merit of &s;ome Latin Po|ets, in a period that we commonly &s;uppo&s;e invol|ved in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t barbari&s;m, is &s;ingularly &s;triking; many of the&s;e are of the Epic kind, and, as they de&s;cribe the manners and cu&s;toms of their re&s;pec|tive times, a complete review of them might form a curious and entertaining work. I &s;hall briefly mention &s;uch as appear mo&s;t worthy of notice.</P>
<P>Abbo, a Pari&s;ian monk, of the Benedictine order, wrote a poem on the &s;iege of Paris by the Nor|mans and the Danes, at which he was pre&s;ent, in the year 886: it is printed in the &s;econd volume of Duche&s;ne's Script. Francorum; and, though it has little or no poetical merit, may be regarded as an hi&s;torical curio&s;ity. The following lines, addre&s;&s;ed to the city of Paris, in the beginning of the work, may &s;erve as a &s;pecimen of its language:
<Q><L>Dic igitur, praepulchra polis, quod Danea munus</L>
<L>Libavit tibimet, &s;oboles Plutonis amica,</L>
<L>Tempore quo prae&s;ul domini et dulci&s;&s;imus heros</L>
<L>Gozlinus temet pa&s;torque benignus alebat!</L>
<L>Haec, inquit, miror, narrare pote&s;t aliqui&s;ne?</L>
<L>Nonne tuis idem vidi&s;ti oculis? refer ergo:</L>
<L>Vidi equidem, ju&s;&s;i&s;que tuis parebo libenter.</L></Q></P>
<P>Lei&s;er has confounded this Poet with another of this name; but Fabricius has corrected the
<PB N="6" REF="7">
mi&s;take, in his Bibliotheca Latina mediae et infi|mae Aetatis.</P>
<P>Guido, Bi&s;hop of Amiens from the year 1058 to 1076, wrote an Heroic poem on the exploits of William the Conqueror, in which, according to Ordericus Vitalis, he imitated both Virgil and Statius. William of Apulia compo&s;ed, at the re|que&s;t of Pope Urban the IId, a poem, in five books, on the actions of the Normans in Sicily, Apulia, and Calabria, to the death of Robert Gui&s;card their prince; addre&s;&s;ing his work to the &s;on of that hero. It was written between the years 1080 and 1099; fir&s;t printed in 1582, 4 to; and again in Muratori's Script. Ital.&mdash;Du Cange, in his Notes to the Alexiad of the Prince&s;s Anna Comnena, has illu&s;trated that hi&s;tory by frequent and long quotations from William of Apulia; but though the learned Critic gives him the title of Scriptor Egregius, his poetry appears to me but a few degrees &s;uperior to that of the Monk Abbo, whom I have ju&s;t mentioned. The Reader may judge from the following pa&s;&s;age, which I &s;elect not only as a &s;pecimen of the Author's &s;tyle, but as it &s;hews that the wives of the&s;e martial Princes &s;hared with them in all the perils of war:

<Q><PB N="7" REF="8"><L>Uxor in hoc bello Roberti fort&egrave; &s;agitt&acirc;</L>
<L>Qu&acirc;dam lae&s;a fuit, quae vulnere territa, nullam</L>
<L>Dum &s;perabat opem, &s;e pen&egrave; &s;ubegerat ho&s;ti,</L>
<L>Navigio cujus &s;e commendare volebat,</L>
<L>In&s;tantis metuens vicina pericula lethi:</L>
<L>Hanc deus eripuit, fieri ludibria nolens</L>
<L>Matronae tantae tam nobilis et venerandae.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Prince&s;s Comnena has al&s;o celebrated the fortitude which this Heroine, who&s;e name was Gaita, di&s;played in the battle; and it is remarkable, that the royal female Hi&s;torian de&s;cribes the noble Amazon more poetically than the Latin Poet.</P>
<P>Gualfredo, an Italian, who &s;ucceeded to the bi&s;hoprick of Siena in the year 1080, and died in 1127, wrote an Heroic poem on the expedition of Godfrey of Boulogne, which is &s;aid to be &s;till pre|&s;erved in MS. at Siena. I believe Gualfredo is the fir&s;t Poet, in point of time, who treated of the hap|py &s;ubject of the Cru&s;ades; which was afterwards embelli&s;hed by two very elegant writers of Latin ver&s;e, I&s;canus and Gunther, of whom I &s;hall pre|&s;ently &s;peak, and at length received its highe&s;t ho|nour from the genius of Ta&s;&s;o. There is al&s;o an early Latin poem on this &s;ubject, the joint pro|duction of two writers, named Fulco and Aegi|dius, whom the accurate Fabricius places in the
<PB N="8" REF="9">
beginning of the 13th century: the title of the work is Hi&s;toria Ge&s;torum Viae no&s;tri Temporis Hiero&s;olymitanae. It is printed in the fourth volume of Duche&s;ne's Script. Franc. and with con&s;iderable additions in the third volume of Anecdota Edmundi Martene. I tran&s;cribe part of the opening of this poem, as the curious reader may have a plea&s;ure in comparing it with that of Ta&s;&s;o:
<Q><L>Ardor ine&s;t, inquam, &s;ententia fixaque menti</L>
<L>Ver&s;ibus et numeris tran&s;mittere po&s;teritati</L>
<L>Qualiter in&s;tinctu deitatis, et au&s;pice cultu</L>
<L>E&s;t aggre&s;&s;a via memorando nobilis actu,</L>
<L>Qua &s;acro&s;ancti violantes jura &s;epulchri</L>
<L>Digna receperunt meriti commercia pravi.</L>
<L>Inque &s;uis Francis antiqua re&s;urgere Troja</L>
<L>Coepit, et edomuit Chri&s;to contraria regna.</L></Q>
I will only add the portrait of Godfrey:
<Q><L>Inclytus ille ducum Godefridus culmen hono&s;que,</L>
<L>Omnibus exemplum bonitatis militiaeque,</L>
<L>Sive ha&s;ta jaculans aequaret Parthica tela,</L>
<L>Cominus aut feriens terebraret ferrea &s;cuta,</L>
<L>Seu gladio pugnans carnes re&s;ecaret et o&s;&s;a,</L>
<L>Sive eques atque pedes propelleret agmina den&s;a,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="10">
Hic inimicitiis cunctis &s;ibi conciliatis</L>
<L>Cunctis po&s;&s;e&s;&s;is pro Chri&s;ti pace relictis</L>
<L>Arripuit callem Chri&s;tum &s;ectando vocantem.</L></Q>
The poem clo&s;es with the capture of Jeru&s;alem.</P>
<P>Laurentius of Verona, who flouri&s;hed about the year 1120, wrote an Heroic poem, in &s;even books, intitled, Rerum in Majorica Pi&s;anorum. Edidit Ughellus, tom. 3. Italiae &s;acrae.</P>
<P>But, in merit and reputation, the&s;e early Latin Poets of modern time are very far inferior to Phi|lip Gualtier de Chatillon, who &s;eems to have been the fir&s;t that caught any portion of true poetic &s;pirit in Latin ver&s;e. He was Provo&s;t of the Canons of Tournay<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fabricius calls him Epi&s;copus Magalonen&s;is. Bib. Lat. tom. ii. p. 255.</NOTE> about the year 1200, according to Mr. Warton, who has given &s;ome &s;pecimens of his &s;tyle in the &s;econd Di&s;&s;ertation prefixed to his admirable Hi&s;tory of Engli&s;h Poetry. I &s;hall therefore only add, that the be&s;t edition of his Alexandreid, an Heroic poem in ten books on Alexander the Great, was printed at Leyden, 4to, 1558.</P>
<P>The &s;uperior merit of Jo&s;ephus I&s;canus, or
<PB N="10" REF="11">
Jo&s;eph of Exeter, has been al&s;o di&s;played by the &s;ame judicious Encomia&s;t, in the Di&s;&s;ertation I have mentioned; nor has he failed to commemo|rate two Latin Epic Poets of the &s;ame period, and of con&s;iderable merit for the time in which they lived&mdash;Gunther, and William of Bretagny; the fir&s;t was a German monk, who wrote after the year 1108, and has left various hi&s;torical and poetical works; particularly two of the Epic kind&mdash;Solymarium, a poem on the taking of Jeru&s;alem by Godfrey of Bulloign; and another, intitled Ligurinus, on the exploits of the Emperor Fre|derick Barbaro&s;&s;a, which he completed during the life of that Prince. The fir&s;t was never printed; of the latter there have been &s;everal editions, and one by the celebrated Melancthon, in 1569. That his poetical merit was con&s;iderable in many re|&s;pects, will appear from the following ver&s;es, in which he &s;peaks of him&s;elf:<Q><L>Hoc quoque me famae, &s;i de&s;int caetera, &s;olum</L>
<L>Conciliare pote&s;t, quod jam per multa latentes</L>
<L>Saecula, nec clau&s;is prodire penatibus au&s;as</L>
<L>Pierides vulgare paro, pri&s;cumque nitorem</L>
<L>Reddere carminibus, tardo&s;que citare poetas.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12">
William of Bretagny was preceptor to Pierre Charlot, natural &s;on of Philip Augu&s;tus, King of France, and addre&s;&s;ed a poem to his pupil, intitled Karlotis, which is yet unpubli&s;hed; but his greater work, called Philippis, an Heroic poem in twelve books, is printed in the collections of Duche&s;ne and Pithaeus; and in a &s;eparate 4to volume, with a co|pious commentary by Barthius. Notwith&s;tanding the prai&s;es be&s;towed on this Author by his learned Commentator, who prefers him to all his contem|poraries, he appears to me inferior in poetic &s;pirit to his three rivals, Gualtier de Chatillon, I&s;canus, and Gunther. Yet his work is by no means de&s;picable in its &s;tyle, and may be con&s;idered as a valuable picture of the times in which he lived; for he was him&s;elf engaged in many of the &s;cenes which he de&s;cribes. His profe&s;t de&s;ign is to celebrate the exploits of Philip Augu&s;tus; and he clo&s;es his poem with the death of that Monarch, which happened in 1223. He addre&s;&s;es his work, in two &s;eparate poetical de|dications, to Lewis, the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Philip, and to Pierre Charlot his natural &s;on, who was Bi&s;hop of Noyon in 1240, and died 1249. He &s;eems to have been excited to this compo&s;ition by the reputation of Gualtier's Alexandreid; to which he thus alludes, in the ver&s;es addre&s;&s;ed to Lewis:
<Q><PB N="12" REF="13"><L>Ge&s;ta ducis Macedum celebri de&s;cribere ver&s;u</L>
<L>Si licuit, Gualtere, tibi, quae &s;ola relatu</L>
<L>Multivago docuit te vociferatio famae&mdash;</L>
<L>&mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</L>
<L>Cur ego quae novi, proprio quae lumine vidi,</L>
<L>Non au&s;im magni magnalia &s;cribere regis,</L>
<L>Qui nec Alexandro minor e&s;t virtute, nec illo</L>
<L>Urbi Romuleae totum qui &s;ubdidit orbem?</L></Q></P>
<P>He takes occa&s;ion al&s;o, in two other parts of his poem, to pay a liberal compliment to Gualtier, to whom, in poetical ability, he confe&s;&s;es him&s;elf inferior; but this inferiority his admirer Barthius will not allow. Of their re&s;pective talents the reader may judge, who will compare the pa&s;&s;age which Mr. Warton has cited from the Alexan|dreid, with the following lines, in which William of Bretagny u&s;es the very &s;imile of his predece&s;&s;or, comparing his hero Philip to a young lion:
<Q><L>Rex dolet ereptum comitem &s;ibi, frendit, et irae</L>
<L>Occultare nequit tectos &s;ub pectore motus,</L>
<L>Nam rubor in vultu duplicatus prodit aperte</L>
<L>Quam gravis illu&s;trem trahit indignatio mentem.</L>
<L>Qualiter in Lybicis &s;pumante leunculo rictu</L>

<P>I will add the following pa&s;&s;age from the eleventh Book, as it contains an animated portrait, and a &s;imile more original than the preceding.</P>

<P>William of Bretagny had an immediate &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or in Latin poetry, who appears to have at lea&s;t an equal portion of poetical &s;pirit; the name of this Author is Nicholas de Brai, who wrote an Heroic poem on the actions of Louis the VIIIth, after the death of that Monarch, and addre&s;&s;ed it to William of Auvergne, who was Bi&s;hop of Paris from the year 1228 to 1248. As a &s;pecimen of his de&s;criptive power, I &s;elect the following lines, which form part of a long de&s;cription of a Goblet pre&s;ented to the King on his acce&s;&s;ion:

<Q><PB N="15" REF="16"><L>&mdash;Parant intrare palatia regis</L>

<P>The Author proceeds to de&s;cribe Thebes and Troy, as they are figured on this &s;uperb Goblet; and concludes his account of the workman&s;hip with the four following lines, of peculiar beauty for the age in which they appeared:
<Q><L>Martis adulterium re&s;upino margine pinxit</L>

This Poem, which the author &s;eems to have left imperfect, is printed in the fifth volume of Duche&s;ne's Script. Francorum.&mdash;England is &s;aid to have produced another Heroic Poet of con|fiderable merit, who celebrated in Latin ver&s;e the exploits of Richard the Fir&s;t, and who was called Gulielmus Peregrinus, from his having attended that Prince to the Holy Land. Leland mentions him by the name of Gulielmus de Canno, and Pits calls him Poetarum &s;ui temporis apud no&s;|trates facile Princeps; but I do not find that his Work was ever printed; nor do the &s;everal bio|graphical writers who &s;peak of him, inform us where it exi&s;ts in MS.</P>
<P>In Italy the Latin language is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been cultivated with &s;till greater &s;ucce&s;s, and the re&s;toration of its purity is in great mea&s;ure a&s;cribed to Albertino Mu&s;&s;ato, who&s;e merits were fir&s;t di&s;played to our country by the learned author of the E&s;&s;ay on Pope.&mdash;Mu&s;&s;ato was a Paduan, of high rank and great talents, but unfortunate. He died in exile, 1329, and left, be&s;ides many &s;maller Latin pieces, an Heroic Poem, De Ge&s;tis Italorum po&s;t Henricum VII.

<P>In a few years after the death of Mu&s;&s;ato, Pe|trarch received the laurel at Rome, for his Latin Epic poem, intitled Africa; a performance which has &s;unk &s;o remarkably from the high reputation it once obtained, that the great admirer and encomia&s;t of Petrarch, who has publi&s;hed three entertaining quarto volumes on his life, calls it <Q REND="inline">"Un ouvrage &s;ans chaleur, &s;ans invention, &s;ans interet, qui n'a pas meme le merite de la ver&s;ifi|cation &amp; du &s;tyle, &amp; dont il e&s;t impo&s;&s;ible de &s;ou|tenir la lecture.</Q>&mdash;I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, however, that Ta&s;&s;o, in his E&s;&s;ay on Epic Poetry, be&s;tows a very high encomium on that part of Petrarch's Latin poem, in which he celebrates the loves of Sophoni&s;ba and Ma&s;ini&s;&s;a; and indeed the cen&s;ure of this amiable French writer, who in other points has done ample ju&s;tice to the merits of Petrarch, appears to me infinitely too &s;evere. There are many pa&s;&s;ages in this neglected Poem conceived with great force and imagination, and expre&s;&s;ed with equal elegance of language.

<P>With Petrarch I may clo&s;e this cur&s;ory review of the neglected authors who wrote Heroic poems
<PB N="20" REF="21">
in Latin, during the cour&s;e of the dark ages.&mdash;A peculiar circum&s;tance induces me to add another name to the preceding li&s;t. John, Abbot of Pe|terborough, in the reign of Edward the Third, wrote an Heroic poem, intitled Bellum Navar|ren&s;e, 1366, de Petro rege Aragoniae &amp; Edwardo Principe. This performance, containing five hun|dred and &s;ixty ver&s;es, is &s;aid to be pre&s;erved in MS. in the Bodleian Library; and I have thought it worthy of notice, becau&s;e it treats of the very &s;ubject on which Dryden informs us he had once projected an Epic poem.</P>
<P>Of the many Latin compo&s;itions of the Epic kind, which later times have produced, the Chri&s;|tiad of Vida, the Sarcotis of Ma&s;&s;enius, and the Con&s;tantine of Mambrun, appear to me the mo&s;t worthy of regard; but even the&s;e are &s;eldom pe|ru&s;ed: and indeed the Poet, who in a poli&s;hed age prefers the u&s;e of a dead language to that of a living one, can only expect, and perhaps only de&s;erves, the attention of a few curious &s;eque&s;tered &s;tudents.</P>

<L><HI>Thy daring Dante his wild Vi&s;ion &s;ung.</HI>]</L>
<P>Dante Allighieri was born at Florence, in May 1265, of
<PB N="21" REF="22">
an ancient and honourable family. Boccacio, who lived in the &s;ame period, has left a very cu|rious and entertaining Treati&s;e, on the Life, the Studies, and Manners of this extraordinary Poet; whom he regarded as his ma&s;ter, and for who&s;e memory he profe&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t veneration. This intere&s;ting biographer relates, that Dante, before he was nine years old, conceived a pa&s;&s;ion for the lady whom he has immortalized in his &s;ingular Poem. Her age was near his own; and her name was Beatrice, the daughter of Folco Portinari, a noble citizen of Florence. Of this fair one the be&s;t accounts are ob&s;cure. Some refining commen|tators have even denied her corporeal exi&s;tence; affirming her to be nothing more or le&s;s than Theology: but we may que&s;tion if Theology was ever the mi&s;tre&s;s of &s;o young a lover. The pa&s;&s;ion of Dante, however, like that of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or Pe|trach, &s;eems to have been of the cha&s;te and Pla|tonic kind, according to the account he has him|&s;elf given of it, in one of his early productions, intitled Vita Nuova; a mixture of my&s;terious poetry and pro&s;e, in which he mentions both the origin of his affection, and the death of his mi&s;tre&s;s; who, according to Boccacio, died at the age of twenty-four. The &s;ame author a&s;&s;erts, that Dante fell into a deep melancholy in con&s;equence of this
<PB N="22" REF="23">
event, from which his friends endeavoured to rai&s;e him, by per&s;uading him to marriage. After &s;ome time he followed their advice, and repented it; for he unfortunately made choice of a lady who bore &s;ome re&s;emblance to the celebrated Xantippe. The Poet, not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the patience of Socrates, &s;eparated him&s;elf from her with &s;uch vehement expre&s;&s;ions of di&s;like, that he never afterwards admitted her to his pre&s;ence, though &s;he had borne him &s;everal children.&mdash;In the early part of his life he gained &s;ome credit in a military character; di&s;tingui&s;hing him&s;elf by his bravery in an action where the Florentines obtained a &s;ignal victory over the citizens of Arezzo. He became &s;till more eminent by the acqui&s;ition of civil honours; and at the age of thirty-five he ro&s;e to be one of the chief magi&s;trates of Florence, when that dig|nity was conferred by the &s;uffrages of the people. From this exaltation the Poet him&s;elf dated his principal misfortunes, as appears from the fragment of a letter quoted by Lionardo Bruni, one of his early biographers, where Dante &s;peaks of his po|litical failure with that liberal frankne&s;s which in|tegrity in&s;pires.&mdash;Italy was at that time di&s;tracted by the contending factions of the Ghibellins and the Guelphs: the latter, among whom Dante took an active part, were again divided into the Blacks
<PB N="23" REF="24">
and the Whites. Dante, &s;ays Gravina, exerted all his influence to unite the&s;e inferior parties; but his efforts were ineffectual, and he had the misfor|tune to be unju&s;tly per&s;ecuted by tho&s;e of his own faction. A powerful citizen of Florence, named Cor&s;o Donati, had taken mea&s;ures to terminate the&s;e inte&s;tine broils, by introducing Charles of Valois, brother to Philip the Fair, King of France. Dante, with great vehemence, oppo&s;ed this di&s;|graceful project, and obtained the bani&s;hment of Donati and his partizans. The exiles applied to the Pope (Boniface the VIIIth), and by his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance &s;ucceeded in their de&s;ign. Charles of Valois entered Florence in triumph, and tho&s;e who had oppo&s;ed his admi&s;&s;ion were bani&s;hed in their turn. Dante had been di&s;patched to Rome as the amba&s;|&s;ador of his party, and was returning, when he received intelligence of the revolution in his native city. His enemies, availing them&s;elves of his ab|&s;ence, had procured an iniquitous &s;entence again&s;t him, by which he was condemned to bani&s;hment, and his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were confi&s;cated. His two en|thu&s;ia&s;tic biographers, Boccacio and Manetti, ex|pre&s;s the warme&s;t indignation again&s;t this inju&s;tice of his country.&mdash;Dante, on receiving the intelli|gence, took refuge in Siena, and afterwards in Arezzo, where many of his party were a&s;&s;embled.
<PB N="24" REF="25">
An attempt was made to &s;urpri&s;e the city of Flo|rence, by a &s;mall army which Dante is &s;uppo&s;ed to have attended: the de&s;ign mi&s;carried, and our Poet is conjectured to have wandered to various parts of Italy, till he found a patron in the great Can della Scala, Prince of Verona, whom he has celebrated in his Poem. The high &s;pirit of Dante was ill &s;uited to courtly dependence; and he is &s;aid to have lo&s;t the favour of his Verone&s;e patron by the rough frankne&s;s of his behaviour. From Ve|rona he retired to France, according to Manetti; and Boccacio affirms that he di&s;puted in the The|ological Schools of Paris with great reputation. Bayle que&s;tions his vi&s;iting Paris at this period of his life, and thinks it improbable that a man, who had been one of the chief magi&s;trates of Florence, &s;hould conde&s;cend to engage in the public &s;quabbles of the Pari&s;ian Theologi&s;ts. But the &s;pirit both of Dante, and the times in which he lived, &s;ufficiently account for this exerci&s;e of his talents; and his re&s;idence in France at this &s;ea&s;on is confirmed by Boccacio, in his life of our Poet, which Bayle &s;eems to have had no opportunity of con&s;ulting.</P>
<P>The election of Henry Count of Luxemburgh to the empire, in November 1308, afforded Dante a pro&s;pect of being re&s;tored to his native city, as he attached him&s;elf to the intere&s;t of the new Em|peror,
<PB N="25" REF="26">
in who&s;e &s;ervice he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have writ|ten his Latin treati&s;e De Monarchia, in which he a&s;&s;erted the rights of the Empire again&s;t the en|croachments of the Papacy. In the year 1311, he in&s;tigated Henry to lay &s;iege to Florence; in which enterprize, &s;ays one of his Biographers, he did not appear in per&s;on, from motives of re&s;pect towards his native city. The Emperor was re|pul&s;ed by the Florentines; and his death, which happened in the &s;ucceeding year, deprived Dante of all hopes concerning his re-e&s;tabli&s;hment in Florence.</P>
<P>After this di&s;appointment, he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome years in roving about Italy in a &s;tate of poverty and di&s;tre&s;s, till he found an honourable e&s;tabli&s;hment at Ravenna, under the protection of Guido Novello da Polenta, the lord of that city, who received this illu&s;trious exile with the mo&s;t endearing liberality, continued to protect him through the few remaining years of his life, and ex|tended his munificence to the a&s;hes of the Poet.</P>
<P>Eloquence was one of the many talents which Dante po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in an eminent degree. On this account he is &s;aid to have been employed on four|teen different emba&s;&s;ies in the cour&s;e of his life, and to have &s;ucceeded in mo&s;t of them. His patron Guido had occa&s;ion to try his abilities in a &s;ervice of this
<PB N="26" REF="27">
nature, and di&s;patched him as his amba&s;&s;ador to ne|gociate a peace with the Venetians, who were pre|paring for ho&s;tilities again&s;t Ravenna. Manetti a&s;|&s;erts that he was unable to procure a public audi|ence at Venice, and returned to Ravenna by land, from his apprehen&s;ions of the Venetian fleet; when the fatigue of his journey, and the mortifi|cation of failing in his attempt to pre&s;erve his ge|nerous patron from the impending danger, threw him into a fever, which terminated in death on the 14th of September 1321. He died, however, in the palace of his friend, and the affectionate Guido paid the mo&s;t tender regard to his memory. This magnificent patron, &s;ays Boccacio, commanded the body to be adorned with poetical ornaments, and, after being carried on a bier through the &s;treets of Ravenna by the mo&s;t illu&s;trious citizens, to be depo&s;ited in a marble coffin. He pronoun|ced him&s;elf the funeral oration, and expre&s;&s;ed his de&s;ign of erecting a &s;plendid monument in honour of the decea&s;ed: a de&s;ign which his &s;ub&s;equent misfortunes rendered him unable to accompli&s;h. At his reque&s;t, many epitaphs were written on the Poet: the be&s;t of them, &s;ays Boccacio, by Gi|ovanni del Virgilio of Bologna, a famous author of that time, and the intimate friend of Dante. Boccacio then cites a few Latin ver&s;es, not
<PB N="27" REF="28">
worth tran&s;cribing, &s;ix of which are quoted by Bayle as the compo&s;ition of Dante him&s;elf, on the authority of Paul Jovius. In 1483, Bernardo Bembo, the father of the celebrated Cardinal, rai&s;ed a hand&s;ome monument over the neglected a&s;hes of the Poet, with the following in&s;cription:
<Q><L>Exigua tumuli Danthes hic &s;orte jacebas</L>
<L>Squallenti nulli cognita paen&egrave; &s;itu;</L>
<L>At nunc marmoreo &s;ubnixus conderis arcu,</L>
<L>Omnibus et cultu &s;plendidiore nites:</L>
<L>Nimirum Bembus, Mu&s;is incen&s;us Etru&s;cis,</L>
<L>Hoc tibi, quem in primis hae coluere, dedit.</L></Q></P>
<P>Before this period the Florentines had vainly endeavoured to obtain the bones of their great Poet from the city of Ravenna. In the age of Leo the Xth they made a &s;econd attempt, by a &s;olemn application to the Pope for that purpo&s;e; and the great Michael Angelo, an enthu&s;ia&s;tic admirer of Dante, very liberally offered to execute a magnifi|cent monument to the Poet. The hopes of the Florentines were again un&s;ucce&s;sful. The parti|culars of their &s;ingular petition may be found in the notes to Condivi's Life of Michael Angelo.</P>
<P>The per&s;on and manners of Dante are thus re|pre&s;ented by the de&s;criptive pen of Boccacio:&mdash;

The&s;e lively ver&s;es were evidently written be|fore the Poet lo&s;t the object of his earlie&s;t attach|ment, as &s;he is mentioned by the name of Bice. At what time, and in what place, he executed the great and &s;ingular work which has rendered him immortal, his numerous Commentators &s;eem un|able to determine. Boccacio a&s;&s;erts, that he began it in his thirty-fifth year, and had fini&s;hed &s;even Cantos of his Inferno before his exile; that in the plunder of his hou&s;e, on that event, the beginning of his poem was fortunately pre&s;erved, but remain|ed for &s;ome time neglected; till its merit being ac|cidently di&s;covered by an intelligent Poet, named Dino, it was &s;ent to the Marquis Maroello Male&s;|pina, an Italian nobleman, by whom Dante was then protected. The Marquis re&s;tored the&s;e lo&s;t papers to the Poet, and entreated him to proceed in a work which opened in &s;o promi&s;ing a manner. To this incident we are probably indebted for the poem of Dante, which he mu&s;t have continued under all the di&s;advantages of an unfortunate and agitated life. It does not appear at what time he completed it; perhaps before he quitted Vero|na, as he dedicated the Paradi&s;e to his Verone&s;e patron.&mdash;The Critics have variou&s;ly accounted for his having called his poem Comedia. He gave it that title, &s;aid one of his &s;ons, becau&s;e it opens with di&s;tre&s;s, and clo&s;es with felicity. The very high
<PB N="31" REF="32">
e&s;timation in which this production was held by his country, appears from a &s;ingular in&s;titution. The republic of Florence, in the year 1373, a&s;&s;igned a public &s;tipend to a per&s;on appointed to read lec|tures on the poem of Dante: Boccacio was the fir&s;t per&s;on engaged in this office; but his death happening in two years after his appointment, his Comment extended only to the &s;eventeen fir&s;t Cantos of the Inferno. The critical di&s;&s;ertations that have been written on Dante are almo&s;t as numerous as tho&s;e to which Homer has given birth: the Italian, like the Grecian Bard, has been the &s;ubject of the highe&s;t panegyric, and of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t invective. Voltaire has &s;poken of him with that precipitate vivacity, which &s;o frequently led that lively Frenchman to in&s;ult the reputation of the noble&s;t writers. In one of his entertaining letters, he &s;ays to an Italian Abb&eacute;, <Q REND="inline">"Je fais grand cas du courage, avec lequel vous avez o&s;&eacute; dire que Dante etoit un fou, et &s;on ouvrage un mon&s;tre&mdash;Le Dante pourra entrer dans les bibliotheques des curieux, mais il ne &s;era jamais lu."</Q> But more temperate and candid Critics have not been wanting, to di&s;play the merits of this original Poet. Mr. Warton has introduced into his la&s;t volume on Engli&s;h Poetry, a judicious and &s;pirited &s;ummary of Dante's performance. We
<PB N="32" REF="33">
have &s;everal ver&s;ions of the celebrated &s;tory of Ugo|lino; but I believe no entire Canto of Dante has hitherto appeared in our language, though his whole work has been tran&s;lated into French, Spani&s;h, and Latin ver&s;e. The three Cantos which follow were tran&s;lated a few years ago, to oblige a particular friend. The Author has &s;ince been &s;olicited to execute an entire tran&s;lation of Dante: but the extreme inequality of this Poet would render &s;uch a work a very laborious undertaking; and it appears very doubtful how far &s;uch a ver&s;ion would intere&s;t our country. Per|haps the reception of the&s;e Cantos may di&s;cover to<PB N="33" REF="34">the Tran&s;lator the &s;entiments of the public. At all events, he flatters him&s;elf that the en&s;uing por|tion of a celebrated poem may afford &s;ome plea&s;ure from its novelty, as he has endeavoured to give the Engli&s;h reader an idea of Dante's peculiar manner, by adopting his triple rhyme; and he does not re|collect that this mode of ver&s;ification has ever ap|peared before in our language: it has obliged him, of cour&s;e to make the number of tran&s;lated lines corre&s;pond exactly with tho&s;e of the original. The difficulties attending this metre will &s;ufficiently &s;hew them&s;elves, and obtain &s;ome degree of indul|gence from the intelligent and candid reader.</P>

<L><HI>The gay Boccacio tempts th' Italian Mu&s;e.</HI>]</L>
<P>Boc|cacio was almo&s;t utterly unknown to our country as a Poet, when two of our mo&s;t accompli&s;hed Critics re&s;tored his poetical reputation.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrwhitt, to whom Chaucer is as deeply indebted as a Poet can be to the judgment and erudition of his commentator, has given a &s;ketch of Boccacio's The&s;eida, in his introductory di&s;|cour&s;e to the Canterbury Tales; and Mr. War|ton has enriched the fir&s;t volume of his Hi&s;tory of Engli&s;h Poetry with a con&s;iderable &s;pecimen of this very rare Italian Epic poem, of which our country is &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s but a &s;ingle copy.&mdash;The father of Boccacio was an Italian merchant, a na|tive<PB N="65" REF="66">of Certaldo, near Florence, who in his travels attached him&s;elf to a young woman of Paris; and our Poet is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the illegitimate offspring of that connection. He was born in 1313, and educated as a &s;tudent of the canon law; but a &s;ight of Virgil's tomb, according to Filippo Villani, his mo&s;t ancient Biographer, made him re&s;olve to relinqui&s;h his more irk&s;ome pur&s;uits, and devote him&s;elf entirely to the Mu&s;es. His life &s;eems to have been divided between literature and love, as he was equally remarkable for an amo|rous di&s;po&s;ition, and a pa&s;&s;ionate attachment to &s;tudy. His mo&s;t celebrated mi&s;tre&s;s was Mary of Arragon, the natural daughter of Robert, King of Naples, the generous and enthu&s;ia&s;tic patron of Petrarch. To this lady, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name
<PB N="66" REF="67">
of The Fiammetta, Boccacio addre&s;&s;ed his capital poem, the The&s;eida; telling her, in an introduc|tory letter, that it contained many allu&s;ions to the particular circum&s;tances of their own &s;ecret attach|ment. In his latter days he retired to Certaldo, and died there in the year 1475, of a di&s;order &s;uppo&s;ed to have ari&s;en from exce&s;&s;ive application. Few au|thors have rendered more e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to the re|public of letters than Boccacio, as he not only con|tributed very much to the improvement of his na|tive language, but was particularly in&s;trumental in promoting the revival of ancient learning: a merit which he &s;hared with Petrarch. The tender and ge|nerous friend&s;hip which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the&s;e two engaging authors, reflects the highe&s;t honour on both; and their letters to each other may be ranked among the mo&s;t intere&s;ting productions of that pe|riod. Boccacio compo&s;ed, according to Quadrio, no le&s;s than thirty-four volumes. His Novels are univer&s;ally known: his Poetical Works are as follow: 1. La The&s;eida in Ottava Rima. 2. L'A|moro&s;a Vi&s;ione in Terza Rima. 3. Il Filo&s;trato in Ottava Rima. 4. Il Ninfale Fie&s;olano in Ot|tava Rima.&mdash;He piqued him&s;elf on being the fir&s;t Poet who &s;ung of martial &s;ubjects in Italian ver&s;e; and he has been generally &s;uppo&s;ed the inventor of the Ottava Rima, the common Heroic mea&s;ure<PB N="67" REF="68">
of the Italian Mu&s;e: but Quadrio has &s;hewn that it was u&s;ed by preceding writers; and Pa&s;quier, in his Recherches, has quoted two &s;tanzas of Thi|baud King of Navarre, written in the &s;ame mea|&s;ure, on Blanch queen of France, who died in 1252. The neglect into which the Poems of Boccacio had fallen appears the more &s;triking, as he pecu|liarly prided him&s;elf on his poetical character; in|forming the world, by an in&s;cription on his tomb, that Poetry was his favourite pur&s;uit&mdash;Studium fuit alma Poe&s;is, are the la&s;t words of the epitaph which he compo&s;ed for him&s;elf.</P>

<P>Giovan|ni Giorgio Tri&s;&s;ino was born of a noble family in Vicenza, 1478: he was particularly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by a pa&s;&s;ion for Poetry and Architecture; and one of the very few Poets who have been rich enough to build a palace. This he is &s;aid to have done from a de&s;ign of his own, under the direction of the celebrated Palladio. He had the merit of writing the fir&s;t regular tragedy in the Italian lan|guage, entitled Sophoni&s;ba; but in his Epic poem he is generally allowed to have failed, though &s;ome learned Critics (and Gravina among&s;t them) have
<PB N="68" REF="69">
endeavoured to &s;upport the credit of that per|formance. His &s;ubject was the expul&s;ion of the Goths from Italy by Beli&s;arius; and his poem con&s;i&s;ts of twenty-&s;even books, in blank ver&s;e.

<P>Ale&s;|&s;andro Ta&s;&s;oni, the &s;uppo&s;ed inventor of the mo|dern Heroi-comic Poetry, was born at Modena, 1565. His family was noble; but his parents dy|ing during his infancy, left him expo&s;ed to vexa|tious law-&s;uits, which ab&s;orbed a great part of his patrimony, and rendered him dependant. In 1599 he was engaged as Secretary to Cardinal A&s;canio
<PB N="72" REF="73">
Colonna, whom he attended on an emba&s;&s;y into Spain. He was occa&s;ionally di&s;patched into Italy on the &s;ervice of that Prelate, and in the cour&s;e of one of the&s;e expeditions wrote his Ob&s;ervations on Petrarch. In 1605 he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have quitted the &s;ervice of the Cardinal, and to have lived in a &s;tate of freedom at Rome, where, in 1607, he became the chief of a literary &s;ociety, intitled Academia degli Umori&s;ti. He was afterwards em|ployed in the &s;ervice of Charles Emanuel, Duke of Savoy; which, after &s;uffering many vexations in it, he quitted with a de&s;ign of devoting him&s;elf to &s;tudy and retirement. But this de&s;ign he was induced to relinqui&s;h, and to &s;erve the Cardinal Lodovi&s;io, nephew of Pope Gregory XV. from whom he received a con&s;iderable &s;tipend. On the death of this patron, in 1632, he was recalled to his native city by Francis the Fir&s;t, Duke of Mo|dena, and obtained an honourable e&s;tabli&s;hment in the court of that Prince. Age had now rendered him unable to enjoy his good fortune: his health declined in the year of his return, and he expired in April 1635. His genius was particularly di&s;po&s;ed to lively &s;atire; and the incidents of his life had a tendency to increa&s;e that di&s;po&s;ition. After having pa&s;&s;ed many vexatious and unprofitable years in

the &s;ervice of the Great, he had his portrait painted, with a fig in his hand; and Muratori &s;uppo&s;es him to have written the&s;e two lines on the oc|ca&s;ion:

<P>The fa|mous Lope de Vega, frequently called the Shake|&s;pear of Spain, is perhaps the mo&s;t fertile Poet in the annals of Parna&s;&s;us; and it would be difficult to name any author, ancient or modern, &s;o univer&s;ally idolized while living by all ranks of people, and &s;o magnificently rewarded by the liberality of the Great. He was the &s;on of Felix de Vega and Franci&s;ca Fernandez, who were both de&s;cended from honour|able
<PB N="74" REF="75">
families, and lived in the neighbourhood of Madrid. Our Poet was born in that city, on the 25th of November 1562. He was, according to his own expre&s;&s;ion, a Poet from his cradle; and, begin|ning to make ver&s;es before he had learned to write, he u&s;ed to bribe his elder &s;chool-fellows with a part of his breakfa&s;t, to commit to paper the lines he had compo&s;ed. Having lo&s;t his father while he was &s;till a child, he engaged in a frolic, very natural to a lively boy, and wandered with another lad to va|rious parts of Spain, till, having &s;pent their mo|ney, and being conducted before a magi&s;trate at Segovia, for offering to &s;ell a few trinkets, they were &s;ent home again to Madrid. Soon after this adven|ture, our young Poet was taken under the protec|tion of Geronimo Manrique, Bi&s;hop of Avila, and began to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf by his dramatic com|po&s;itions, which were received with great applau&s;e by the public, though their author had not yet completed his education; for, after this period, he became a member of the univer&s;ity of Alcala, where he devoted him&s;elf for four years to the &s;tudy of philo&s;ophy. He was then engaged as Secretary to the Duke of Alva, and wrote his Arcadia in compliment to that patron; who is frequently mentioned in his Occa&s;ional Poems. He quitted that employment on his marriage with I&s;abel de
<PB N="75" REF="76">
Urbina, a lady (&s;ays his friend and biographer Pe|rez de Montalvan) beautiful without artifice, and virtuous without affectation. His dome&s;tic happi|ne&s;s was &s;oon interrupted by a painful incident:&mdash;Having written &s;ome lively ver&s;es in ridicule of a per&s;on who had taken &s;ome injurious freedom with his character, he received a challenge in con&s;e|quence of his wit; and happening, in the duel which en&s;ued, to give his adver&s;ary a dangerous wound, he was obliged to fly from his family, and &s;helter him&s;elf in Valencia. He re&s;ided there a con&s;iderable time; but connubial affection recalled him to Madrid. His wife died in the year of his return. His affliction on this event led him to re|linqui&s;h his favourite &s;tudies, and embark on board the Armada which was then preparing for the in|va&s;ion of England. He had a brother who &s;erved in that fleet as a lieutenant; and being &s;hot in an engagement with &s;ome Dutch ve&s;&s;els, his virtues were celebrated by our afflicted Poet, who&s;e heart was peculiarly alive to every generous affection. After the ill &s;ucce&s;s of the Armada, the di&s;con&s;olate Lope de Vega returned to Madrid, and became Secretary to the Marquis of Malpica, to whom he has addre&s;&s;ed a grateful Sonnet. From the &s;ervice of this Patron he pa&s;&s;ed into the hou&s;ehold of the Count of Lemos, whom he celebrates as an ini|mitable

Poet. He was once more induced to quit his attendance on the Great, for the more invi|ting comforts of a married life. His &s;econd choice was Juana de Guardio, of noble birth and &s;in|gular beauty. By this lady he had two children; a &s;on, who died in his infancy, and a daughter, named Feliciana, who &s;urvived her father. The death of his little boy is &s;aid to have ha&s;tened that of his wife, whom he had the misfortune to lo&s;e in about &s;even years after his marriage. Having now experienced the precariou&s;ne&s;s of all human en|joyments, he devoted him&s;elf to a religious life, and fulfilled all the duties of it with the mo&s;t exempla|ry piety; &s;till continuing to produce an a&s;toni&s;hing variety of poetical compo&s;itions. His talents and his virtues procured him many un&s;olicited honours. Pope Urban the VIIIth &s;ent him the Cro&s;s of Malta, with the title of Doctor in Divinity, and appointed him to a place of profit in the Apo&s;tolic Chamber; favours for which he expre&s;&s;ed his gratitude by de|dicating his Corona Tragica (a long poem on the fate of Mary Queen of Scots) to that liberal Pon|tiff. In his &s;eventy-third year he felt the approaches of death, and prepared him&s;elf for it with the utmo&s;t compo&s;ure and devotion. His la&s;t hours were at|tended by many of his intimate friends, and parti|cularly his chief patron the Duke of Se&s;&s;a, whom
<PB N="77" REF="78">
he made his executor; leaving him the care of his daughter Feliciana, and of his various manu&s;cripts. The manner in which he took leave of tho&s;e he loved was mo&s;t tender and affecting. He &s;aid to his Di&s;ciple and Biographer, Montalvan, That true fame con&s;i&s;ted in being good; and that he would willingly exchange all the applau&s;es he had received, to add a &s;ingle deed of virtue to the ac|tions of his life. Having given his dying benedic|tion to his daughter, and performed the la&s;t cere|monies of his religion, he expired on the 25th of Augu&s;t 1635.</P>
<P>The &s;plendor of his funeral was equal to the re&s;pect paid to him while living.&mdash;His magnificent patron, the Duke of Se&s;&s;a, invited the chief nobili|ty of the kingdom to attend it. The ceremony was prolonged through the cour&s;e of &s;everal days; and three &s;ermons in honour of the decea&s;ed were deli|vered by three of the mo&s;t celebrated preachers. The&s;e are printed with the works of the Poet, and may be con&s;idered as curious &s;pecimens of the fal&s;e eloquence which prevailed at that time.

An ingenious Tra|veller, who has lately publi&s;hed a plea&s;ing volume of Letters on the Poetry of Spain, has imputed the duel, in which Lope de Vega was engaged, to the gallantries of his fir&s;t wife; but Montalvan's rela|tion of that adventure clears the honor of the lady, who&s;e innocence is &s;till farther &s;upported by a poem written in her prai&s;e by Pedro de Medina Medi|nilla: it is printed in the works of our Poet, who is introduced in it, under the name of Belardo, ce|lebrating the excellencies and lamenting the lo&s;s of his departed I&s;abel.</P>
<P>Of the per&s;on and manners of Lope de Vega, his friend Montalvan has only given this general account:&mdash;that his frame of body was particularly &s;trong, and pre&s;erved by temperance in continued health;&mdash;that in conver&s;ation he was mild and una&s;&s;uming; courteous to all, and to women pecu|liarly gallant;&mdash;very eager when engaged in the bu&s;ine&s;s of his friends, and &s;omewhat carele&s;s in the management of his own. Of his wealth and cha|rity I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak in a &s;ub&s;equent note. The chief expences in which he indulged him&s;elf were books and pictures; of the latter, he di&s;tributed a few as legacies to his intimate friends:
<PB N="79" REF="80">
to the Duke of Se&s;&s;a, a fine portrait of him&s;elf; and to me, &s;ays Montalvan, another, painted when he was young, &s;urrounded by dogs, monkies, and other mon&s;ters, and writing in the mid&s;t of them, without attending to their noi&s;e.&mdash;Of the ho|nours paid to this extraordinary Poet, his Biogra|pher a&s;&s;erts that no per&s;on of eminence vi&s;ited Spain without &s;eeking his per&s;onal acquaintance; that men yielded him precedence when they met him in the &s;treets, and women &s;aluted him with benedictions when he pa&s;&s;ed under their windows. If &s;uch homage can be de&s;erved by the mo&s;t un|wearied application to poetry, Lope de Vega was certainly entitled to it. He declared that he con|&s;tantly wrote five &s;heets a day; and his biographers, who have formed a calculation from this account, conclude the number of his ver&s;es to be no le&s;s than 21,316,000. His country has very lately pub|li&s;hed an elegant edition of his poems in 19 quarto volumes; his dramatic works are to be added to this collection, and will probably be &s;till more volumi|nous. I &s;hall &s;peak only of the former.&mdash;Among his poems there are &s;everal of the Epic kind; the three following appear to me the mo&s;t remark|able. 1. La Dragontea. 2. La Hermo&s;ura de An|gelica. 3. La Jeru&s;alem Conqui&s;tada. The Dra|gontea con&s;i&s;ts of ten cantos, on the la&s;t expedition
<PB N="80" REF="81">
and death of our great naval hero Sir Francis Drake, whom the Poet, from his exce&s;&s;ive partiality to his country, con&s;iders as an avaricious pirate, or rather, as he chu&s;es to call him, a marine Dragon: and it may be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve that he has treated him accordingly. The poem on Angelica &s;eems to have been written in emulation of Ario&s;to, and it is founded on a hint in that Poet: it was compo&s;ed in the early part of our Author's life, and contains many compliments to his &s;overeign Philip the IId: it con&s;i&s;ts of 20 cantos, and clo&s;es with Angelica's being re&s;tored to her beloved Medoro. In his Je|ru&s;alem Conqui&s;tada he enters the li&s;ts with Ta&s;&s;o, whom he mentions in his preface as having &s;ung the fir&s;t part of the hi&s;tory which he had cho&s;en for his &s;ubject. From the great name of Lope de Vega, I had &s;ome thoughts of pre&s;enting to the reader a &s;ketch of this his mo&s;t remarkable poem; but as an Epic Poet he appears to me &s;o much infe|rior to Ta&s;&s;o, and to his countryman and cotempo|rary Ercilla, that I am unwilling to &s;well the&s;e ex|ten&s;ive notes by an enlarged de&s;cription of &s;o un|&s;ucce&s;sful a work: the Author has prophe&s;ied, in the clo&s;e of it, that, although neglected by his own age, it would be e&s;teemed by futurity:&mdash;a &s;ingular proof that even the mo&s;t favoured writers are frequently di&s;po&s;ed to declaim again&s;t the period in which they
<PB N="81" REF="82">
live. If Lope de Vega could think him&s;elf neglect|ed, what Poet may ever expect to be &s;atisfied with popular applau&s;e?&mdash;But to return to his Jeru&s;alem Conqui&s;tada. Richard the Second of England, and Alphon&s;o the Eighth of Ca&s;tile, are the chief heroes of the poem; which contains twenty cantos, and clo&s;es with the unfortunate return of the&s;e confe|derate Kings, and the death of Saladin. It was fir&s;t printed 1609, more than twenty years after the fir&s;t appearance of Ta&s;&s;o's Jeru&s;alem.&mdash;One of the mo&s;t amiable peculiarities in the character of Lope de Vega, is the extreme liberality with which he commends the merit of his rivals. In his Laurel de Apolo, he celebrates all the eminent Spani&s;h and Portugueze Poets; he &s;peaks both of Camoens and Ercilla with the warme&s;t applau&s;e. Among the mo&s;t plea&s;ing pa&s;&s;ages in this poem, is a com|pliment which he pays to his father, who was, like the father of Ta&s;&s;o, a Poet of con&s;iderable talents.</P>
<P>Among the &s;maller pieces of Lope de Vega, there are two particularly curious: a de&s;criptive poem on the garden of his patron the Duke of Alva; and a &s;onnet in honour of the Invincible Armada. The latter may be con&s;idered as a complete model of Spani&s;h bomba&s;t: <Q REND="inline">"Go forth and burn the world,"</Q> &s;ays the Poet, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to that
<PB N="82" REF="83">
mighty fleet; <Q REND="inline">"my &s;ighs will furni&s;h your &s;ails with a never-failing wind; and my brea&s;t will &s;upply your cannon with inexhau&s;tible fire."</Q>&mdash;Perhaps this may be equalled by a Spani&s;h charac|ter of our Poet, with which I &s;hall clo&s;e my imper|fect account of him. It is his friend and biogra|pher Montalvan, who, in the opening of his life, be&s;tows on him the following titles: El Doctor Frey Lope Felix de Vega Carpio, Portento del Orbe, Gloria de la Nacion, Lu&s;tre de la Patria, Oracula de la Lengua, Centro de la Fama, A&s;&s;umpio de la Invidia, Cuydado de la Fortuna, Fenix de los Siglos, Principe de los Ver&s;os, Orfeo de las Ciencias, Apolo de las Mu&s;as, Horacio de los Poetas, Virgilio de los Epicos, Homero de los Heroycos, Pindaro de los Lyricos, Sofocles de los Tragicos, y Terencio de los Comicos, Unico entre los Mayores, Mayor entre los Grandes, y Grande a todas Luzes, y en todas Materias.</P>

<P>Don Alonzo de Ercilla y Zuniga was equally di&s;tin|gui&s;hed as a Hero and a Poet; but this exalted character, notwith&s;tanding his double claim to our
<PB N="83" REF="84">
regard, is almo&s;t totally unknown in our country; and I &s;hall therefore endeavour to give the Engli&s;h reader the be&s;t idea that I can, both of his gallant life, and of his &s;ingular poem.&mdash;He was born in Madrid, on the 7th of Augu&s;t 1533, the third &s;on of Fortun Garcia de Ercilla, who, tho' de&s;cended from a noble family, pur&s;ued the profe&s;&s;ion of the law, and was &s;o remarkable for his talents, that he acquired the appellation of <Q REND="inline">"The &s;ubtle Spa|niard."</Q> The mother of our Poet was al&s;o noble, and from her he inherited his &s;econd title, Zuniga: Ercilla was the name of an ancient ca&s;tle in Bi&s;cay, which had been long in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his pater|nal ance&s;tors. He lo&s;t his father while he was yet an infant; a circum&s;tance which had great influence on his future life: for his mother was received, after the decea&s;e of her hu&s;band, into the hou&s;ehold of the Empre&s;s I&s;abella, the wife of Charles the Vth, and had thus an early opportunity of introducing our young Alonzo into the palace. He &s;oon ob|tained an appointment there, in the character of page to the Infant Don Philip, to who&s;e &s;ervice he devoted him&s;elf with the mo&s;t heroic enthu&s;ia&s;m, though Philip was a ma&s;ter who little de&s;erved &s;o generous an attachment. At the age of fourteen, he attended that Prince in the &s;plendid progre&s;s which he made, at the de&s;ire of his Imperial father,
<PB N="84" REF="85">
through the principal cities of the Netherlands, and through parts of Italy and Germany. This &s;in|gular expedition is very circum&s;tantially recorded in a folio volume, by a Spani&s;h hi&s;torian named Juan Chri&s;toval Calvete de E&s;trella, who&s;e work affords a very curious and &s;triking picture of the manners and ceremonies of that martial and ro|mantic age. All the cities which were vi&s;ited by the Prince contended with each other in magnifi|cent fe&s;tivity: the brilliant &s;eries of literary and warlike pageants which they exhibited, though they an&s;wered not their de&s;ign of conciliating the affection of the &s;ullen Philip, might probably awaken the genius of our youthful Poet, and excite his ambition to acquire both poetical and military fame. In 1551, he returned with the Prince into Spain, and continued there for three years; at the end of which he attended his royal ma&s;ter to Eng|land, on his marriage with Queen Mary, which was celebrated at Winche&s;ter in the &s;ummer of 1554. At this period Ercilla fir&s;t a&s;&s;umed the military character; for his &s;overeign received ad|vice, during his re&s;idence at London, that the mar|tial natives of Arauco, a di&s;trict on the coa&s;t of Chile, had revolted from the Spani&s;h government; and di&s;patched an experienced officer, named Al|derete, who attended him in England, to &s;ubdue
<PB N="85" REF="86">
the in&s;urrection, inve&s;ting him with the command of the rebellious province. Ercilla embarked with Alderete; but that officer dying in his pa&s;&s;age, our Poet proceeded to Lima. Don Hurtado de Men|doza, who commanded there as Viceroy of Peru, appointed his &s;on Don Garcia to &s;upply the place of Alderete, and &s;ent him with a con&s;iderable force to oppo&s;e the Araucanians. Ercilla was engaged in this enterprize, and greatly di&s;tingui&s;hed him|&s;elf in the ob&s;tinate conte&s;t which en&s;ued. The noble character of the Barbarians who maintained this unequal &s;truggle, and the many &s;plendid feats of valour which this &s;cene afforded, led our author to the &s;ingular de&s;ign of making the war, in which he was him&s;elf engaged, the &s;ubject of an Heroic poem; which he intitled "La Araucana," from the name of the country. As many of his own particular adventures may be found in the follow|ing &s;ummary of his work, I &s;hall not here enlarge on his military exploits; but proceed to one of the mo&s;t mortifying events of his life, which he briefly mentions in the conclu&s;ion of his poem. After pa&s;&s;ing with great honour through many and vari|ous perils, he was on the point of &s;uffering a di&s;|graceful death, from the ra&s;h orders of his young and incon&s;iderate Commander. On his return, from an expedition of adventure and di&s;covery, to
<PB N="86" REF="87">
the Spani&s;h city of Imperial, he was pre&s;ent at a &s;cene of public fe&s;tivity di&s;played there, to cele|brate the acce&s;&s;ion of Philip the IId to the crown of Spain. At a kind of tournament, there aro&s;e an idle di&s;pute between Ercilla and Don Juan de Pi|neda, in the heat of which the two di&s;putants drew their &s;words; many of the &s;pectators joined in the broil; and a report ari&s;ing that the quarrel was a mere pretence, to conceal &s;ome mutinous de&s;ign, the ha&s;ty Don Garcia, their General, committed the two antagoni&s;ts to pri&s;on, and &s;entenced them both to be publicly beheaded. Ercilla him&s;elf de|clares, he was conducted to the &s;caffold before his precipitate judge di&s;covered the iniquity of the &s;en|tence; but his innocence appeared ju&s;t time enough to &s;ave him; and he &s;eems to have been fully rein|&s;tated in the good opinion of Don Garcia, as, among the complimentary &s;onnets addre&s;&s;ed to Er|cilla, there is one which bears the name of his Ge|neral, in which he &s;tyles him the Divine Alonzo, and celebrates both his military and poetical genius. But Ercilla &s;eems to have been deeply wounded by this affront; for, quitting Chile, he went to Callao, the port of Lima, and there embarked on an expe|dition again&s;t a Spani&s;h rebel, named Lope de Aguirre, who, having murdered his captain, and u&s;urped the chief power, was perpetrating the mo&s;t
<PB N="87" REF="88">
cruel enormities in the &s;ettlement of Venezuela. But Ercilla learned, on his arrival at Panama, that this barbarous u&s;urper was de&s;troyed; he therefore re&s;olved, as his health was much impaired by the hard&s;hips he had pa&s;&s;ed, to return to Spain. He arrived there in the twenty-ninth year of his age; but &s;oon left it, and travelled, as he him&s;elf informs us, through France, Italy, Germany, Sile&s;ia, Mo|ravia, and Pannonia; but the particulars of this ex|pedition are unknown. In the year 1570 he ap|peared again at Madrid, and was married to Maria Bazan, a lady whom he contrives to celebrate in the cour&s;e of his military poem. He is &s;aid to have been afterwards gentleman of the bed-chamber to the Emperor Rodolph the IId, a prince who had been educated at Madrid: but the connection of our Poet with this Monarch is very indi&s;tinctly re|corded; and indeed all the latter part of his life is little known. In the year 1580 he re&s;ided at Ma|drid, in a &s;tate of retirement and poverty. The time and circum&s;tances of his death are uncertain: it is proved that he was living in the year 1596, by the evidence of a Spani&s;h writer named Mo&s;quera, who, in a treati&s;e of military di&s;cipline, &s;peaks of Ercilla as engaged at that time in celebrating the victories of Don Alvaro Bazan, Marques de Santa Cruz, in a poem which has never appeared, and is
<PB N="88" REF="89">
&s;uppo&s;ed to have been left imperfect at his death. Some anecdotes related of our Poet afford us ground to hope that his various merits were not en|tirely unrewarded. It is &s;aid, that in &s;peaking to his &s;overeign Philip, he was &s;o overwhelmed by diffidence that language failed him: <Q REND="inline">"Don Alon|zo!"</Q> replied the King, <Q REND="inline">"&s;peak to me in writing."</Q> He did &s;o, and obtained his reque&s;t.&mdash;The Spani&s;h Hi&s;torian Ovalle, who has written an account of Chile, in which he frequently &s;upports his narra|tion by the authority of Ercilla, affirms that our Poet pre&s;ented his work to Philip with his own hand, and received a recompence from the King. But in this circum&s;tance I fear the Hi&s;torian was mi&s;taken, as he &s;uppo&s;es it to have happened on the return of Ercilla from Chile; and our Poet, in a di&s;tinct portion of his work, which was not pub|li&s;hed till many years after that period, expre&s;sly declares, in addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Philip, that all his attempts to &s;erve him had been utterly unrequited. Ercilla left no legitimate family; but had &s;ome na|tural children, the mo&s;t eminent of which was a daughter, who was advantageou&s;ly married to a nobleman of Portugal.</P>
<P>In that elegant collection of Spani&s;h Poets, "<HI>Parna&s;o E&s;panol,</HI>" there is a plea&s;ing little amorous poem, written by Ercilla in his youth,
<PB N="89" REF="90">
which is peculiarly commended by Lope de Vega; who has be&s;towed a very generous encomium on our Poet, in his "<HI>Laurel de Apolo.</HI>" But the great and &s;ingular work which has ju&s;tly render|ed Ercilla immortal, is his Poem intitled Arau|cana, which was publi&s;hed in three &s;eparate parts: the fir&s;t appeared in 1577; he added the &s;econd in the &s;ucceeding year; and in 1590 he printed a complete edition of the whole. It was ap|plauded by the mo&s;t eminent writers of Spain; and Cervantes, in &s;peaking of Don Quixote's Library, has ranked it among the choice&s;t trea|&s;ures of the Ca&s;tilian Mu&s;e. Voltaire, who &s;peaks of Ercilla with his u&s;ual &s;pirit and inaccuracy, has the merit of having made our Poet more ge|nerally known, though his own acquaintance with him appears to have been extremely &s;light; for he affirms that Ercilla was in the battle of Saint Quintin: a mi&s;take into which he never could have fallen, had he read the Araucana. In|deed the undi&s;tingui&s;hing cen&s;ure which he pa&s;&s;es on the poem in general, after commending one particular pa&s;&s;age, &s;ufficiently proves him a perfect &s;tranger to many &s;ub&s;equent parts of the work; yet his remark on the inequality of the Poet is ju&s;t. Ercilla is certainly unequal; but, with all his defects, he appears to me one of the mo&s;t ex|traordinary
<PB N="90" REF="91">
and engaging characters in the poeti|cal world. Perhaps I am a little partial to him, from the accidental circum&s;tance of having fir&s;t read his poem with a departed friend, who&s;e opi|nions are very dear to me, and who was particu|larly fond of this military Bard. However this may be, my idea of Ercilla's merit has led me to hazard the following exten&s;ive &s;ketch of his work:&mdash;it has &s;welled to a much larger &s;ize than I at fir&s;t intended; for I was continually tempted to extend it, by the de&s;ire of not injuring the pe|culiar excellencies of this wonderful Poet. If I have not utterly failed in that de&s;ire, the Engli&s;h reader will be enabled to judge and to enjoy an author, who, con&s;idering his &s;ubject and its execu|tion, may be &s;aid to &s;tand &s;ingle and unparalleled in the ho&s;t of Poets. His beauties and his de|fects are of &s;o obvious a nature, that I &s;hall not enlarge upon them; but let it be remembered, that his poem was compo&s;ed amid&s;t the toils and perils of the mo&s;t fatiguing and hazardous &s;ervice, and that his ver&s;es were &s;ometimes written on &s;craps of leather, from the want of better mate|rials. His &s;tyle is remarkably pure and per|&s;picuous; and, notwith&s;tanding the re&s;traint of rhyme, it has frequently all the ea&s;e, the &s;pirit, and the volubility of Homer. I wi&s;h not, how|ever,
<PB N="91" REF="92">
to conceal his defects; and I have there|fore given a very fair account of the &s;trange epi&s;ode he introduces concerning the hi&s;tory of Dido, which has ju&s;tly fallen under the ridicule of Voltaire. I mu&s;t however ob&s;erve, as an apo|logy for Ercilla, that many Bards of his country have con&s;idered it as a point of honour to defend the reputation of this injured lady, and to attack Virgil with a kind of poetical Quixoti&s;m for hav|ing &s;landered the cha&s;tity of &s;o &s;potle&s;s a heroine. If my memory does not deceive me, both Lope de Vega and Quevedo have employed their pens as the champions of Dido. We may indeed very readily join the laugh of the lively Frenchman again&s;t our Poet on this occa&s;ion; but let us re|collect that Ercilla has infinitely more Homeric &s;pirit, and that his poem contains more genuine Epic beauties, than can be found in Voltaire.</P>
<P>Ercilla has been honoured with many poetical en|comiums by the writers of his own country; and, as I believe the mo&s;t elegant compliment which has been paid to his genius is the production of a Spani&s;h lady, I &s;hall clo&s;e this account of him with a tran&s;lation of the Sonnet, in which &s;he celebrates both the Hero and the Poet.</P>

<Q><L>The Indians fir&s;t, by novelty di&s;may'd,</L>

Lau|taro returns, and receives new honors and new forces from his General, to march again&s;t a Spa|ni&s;h army, which departs from the city of Penco under the command of Villagran, an experienced officer, to revenge the death of Valdivia.

<P>LAUTARO is recalled from his victorious exploits, to a&s;&s;i&s;t at a general a&s;&s;embly of the Indians, in the valley of Arauco. The different Chieftains deliver their various &s;entiments con|cerning the war, after their Leader Caupolican has declared his de&s;ign to pur&s;ue the Spaniards with uncea&s;ing vengeance. The veteran Colocolo propo&s;es a plan for their military operations. An ancient Augur, named Puchecalco, denounces ruin on all the projects of his countrymen, in the name of the Indian Daemon Eponamon. He recites the omens of their de&s;truction. The fierce Tucapel, provoked to frenzy by this gloomy prophet, &s;trikes him dead in the mid&s;t of his harangue, by a &s;udden blow of his mace. Caupolican orders the mur|derous Chieftain to be led to in&s;tant death. He defends him&s;elf with &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t numbers who attempt to &s;eize him.

Lau|taro had i&s;&s;ued orders that no Indian &s;hould &s;ally from the fort under pain of death, to prevent the advantage which the Spani&s;h cavalry mu&s;t have over his &s;mall forces in the open plain. He al&s;o commanded his &s;oldiers to retreat with an appear|ance of di&s;may, at the fir&s;t attack on the fort, and &s;uffer a con&s;iderable number of the enemy to en|ter the place. This &s;tratagem &s;ucceeds: the Spa|niards ru&s;h forward with great fury: the Indians give ground, but, &s;oon turning with redoubled vi|olence on tho&s;e who had pa&s;&s;ed their lines, de&s;troy many, and oblige the re&s;t to &s;ave them&s;elves by a precipitate flight. The Indians, forgetting the orders of their Leader, in the ardour of vengeance &s;ally forth in pur&s;uit of their flying enemy. Lau|taro recalls them by the &s;ound of a military horn, which he blows with the utmo&s;t violence. They
<PB N="128" REF="129">
return, but dare not appear in the pre&s;ence of their offended Commander. He i&s;&s;ues new re&s;tric|tions; and then, &s;ummoning his &s;oldiers toge|ther, addre&s;&s;es them, in a &s;pirited, yet calm and af|fectionate harangue, on the nece&s;&s;ity of martial obedience. While he is yet &s;peaking, the Spa|niards return to the attack, but are again repul&s;ed with great lo&s;s. They retreat, and encamp at the foot of a mountain, unmole&s;ted by any pur&s;uers.</P>

<P>THE Spaniards remain in their camp, while two of their adventurous &s;oldiers engage to return once more to the fort, and examine the &s;tate of it. On their approach, one of them, called Marcos Vaez, is &s;aluted by his name, and promi&s;ed &s;ecurity, by a voice from within the walls. Lau|taro had formerly lived with him on terms of friend|&s;hip, and now invites him into the fort. The Indian Chief harangues on the re&s;olution and the power of his countrymen to exterminate the Spaniards, un|le&s;s they &s;ubmit. He propo&s;es, however, terms of accommodation to his old friend Marcos, and &s;pe|cifies the tribute he &s;hould expect. The Spaniard an&s;wers with di&s;dain, that the only tribute the In|dians would receive from his countrymen would be
<PB N="129" REF="130">
torture and death. Lautaro replies, with great tem|per, that arms, and the valor of the re&s;pective na|tions, mu&s;t determine this point; and proceeds to entertain his gue&s;t with a di&s;play of &s;ix Indians, whom he had mounted and trained to exerci&s;e on Spani&s;h hor&s;es. The Spaniard challenges the whole party: Lautaro will not allow him to engage in any conflict, but di&s;mi&s;&s;es him in peace. He re|calls him, before he had proceeded far from the fort, and, telling him that his &s;oldiers were much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the want of provi&s;ion, entreats him to &s;end a &s;upply, affirming it to be true heroi&s;m to relieve an enemy from the nece&s;&s;ities of famine. The Spaniard &s;ub&s;cribes to the &s;entiment, and en|gages, if po&s;&s;ible, to comply with the reque&s;t. Returning to his camp, he acquaints his Com|mander Villagran with all that had pa&s;&s;ed; who, &s;u&s;pecting &s;ome dangerous de&s;ign from Lautaro, decamps ha&s;tily in the night to regain the city. The Indian Chief is &s;everely mortified by their de|parture, as he had formed a project for cutting off their retreat, by letting large currents of water into the mar&s;hy ground on which the Spaniards were encamped. De&s;pairing of being able to &s;ucceed again&s;t their city, now prepared to re&s;i&s;t him, he returns towards Arauco, mo&s;t &s;orely galled by his di&s;appointment, and thus venting his angui&s;h:

<P>He &s;eems to intend this as an apology (but I

As I have been tempted to dwell much longer than I intended on &s;ome of the mo&s;t pathetic inci|dents of this extraordinary poem, I &s;hall give a more conci&s;e &s;ummary of the remaining cantos.&mdash;On Ercilla's return, the Spaniards continue to &s;trengthen their fort.

<P>GALVARINO appears in the A&s;&s;embly of the Indian Chieftains, and excites them, in a very animated &s;peech, to revenge the barbarity with which he had been treated. He faints from lo&s;s of blood, in the clo&s;e of his harangue, but is recovered by the care of his friends, and re&s;tored to health. The Indians, exa&s;perated by the &s;ight of his wounds, unanimou&s;ly determine to pro&s;ecute the war. The Spaniards, advancing in Arauco, &s;end forth &s;couts to di&s;cover the di&s;po&s;ition of the neighbouring tribes. Ercilla, engaging in this &s;ervice, perceives an old Indian in a &s;eque&s;tered &s;pot, apparently &s;inking under the infirmities of

He endea|vours in vain, though on hor&s;eback, to overtake this aged fugitive, who &s;oon e&s;capes from his &s;ight. He now di&s;covers the tame Deer foretold in his vi&s;ion; and, pur&s;uing it, is conducted through in|tricate paths to a retired cottage, where a courte|ous old man receives him in a friendly manner. Ercilla enquires after the magician Fiton: the old man undertakes to guide him to the &s;ecret man&s;ion of that wonderful Necromancer, to whom he declares him&s;elf related. He adds, that he him|&s;elf was once a di&s;tingui&s;hed warrior; but, having the misfortune to &s;ully his pa&s;t glory, without lo&s;ing his life, in a conflict with another Chieftain, he had withdrawn him&s;elf from &s;ociety, and lived twenty years as a hermit. He now leads Ercilla through a gloomy grove to the cell of the Magi|cian, who&s;e re&s;idence and magical apparatus are de&s;cribed with great force of imagination. Fiton appears from a &s;ecret portal, and proves to be the aged figure who had e&s;caped &s;o &s;wiftly from the &s;ight of Ercilla. At the reque&s;t of his relation, the old Warrior, he conde&s;cends to &s;hew Ercilla the wonders of his art.

<P>THE Araucanian delivers a defiance to Don Garcia, in the name of Caupolican, who challenges the Spani&s;h General to end the war by a &s;ingle combat. The me&s;&s;enger adds, that the whole Indian army will de&s;cend into the plain, on the next morning, to be &s;pectators of the duel. Don Garcia di&s;mi&s;&s;es him with an acceptance of the challenge. At the dawn of day the Indian forces appear in three divi&s;ions. A party of Spa|ni&s;h hor&s;e precipitately attack their left wing, be|fore which Caupolican was advancing. They are repul&s;ed. A general and ob&s;tinate engagement en&s;ues.

<P>THE re&s;erved guard of the Spaniards, in which Ercilla was &s;tationed, advancing to the charge, recover the field, and oblige the main body of the Indians to fly. Caupolican, though victorious in his quarter, &s;ounds a retreat when he perceives this event. The Indians fly in great di&s;order. Ren|go for &s;ome time &s;u&s;tains an unequal conflict, and at la&s;t retreats &s;ullenly into a wood, where he collects &s;everal of the &s;cattered fugitives. As Ercilla hap|pened to advance towards this &s;pot, a Spaniard, called Remon, exhorts him by name to attempt the dangerous but important exploit of forcing this In|dian party from the wood. His honour being thus piqued, he ru&s;hes forward with a few followers, and, after an ob&s;tinate engagement, in which many of the Indians are cut to pieces, the Spani|ards obtain the victory, and return to their camp with &s;everal pri&s;oners. After this great defeat of

the Indian army, the Spaniards, to deter their enemies from all future re&s;i&s;tance, barbarou&s;ly re|&s;olve to execute twelve Chieftains of di&s;tinction, whom they find among their captives, and to leave their bodies expo&s;ed on the trees that &s;urrounded the field of battle. The generous Ercilla, lament|ing this inhuman &s;entence, intercedes particularly for the life of one, alledging that he had &s;een him united with the Spaniards. This per&s;on proves to be Galvarino; who, on hearing the interce&s;&s;ion for his life, produces his mangled arms, which he had concealed in his bo&s;om, and, giving vent to his de|te&s;tation of the Spaniards, in&s;i&s;ts on dying with his countrymen. Ercilla per&s;i&s;ts in vain in his endea|vour to &s;ave him. As no executioner could be found among the Spani&s;h &s;oldiers, a new mode of de&s;truction, &s;ays our Poet, was invented; and every Indian was ordered to terminate his own life by a cord which was given him. The&s;e brave men ha&s;tened to accompli&s;h their fate with as much alacrity, continues Ercilla, as the mo&s;t &s;pirited warrior marches to an attack. One alone of the twelve begins to he&s;itate, and pray for mercy; declaring him&s;elf the lineal de&s;cendant of the mo&s;t ancient race and &s;overeign of the country. He is interrupted by the reproaches of the impetuous Galvarino, and, repenting his timidity, atones for it by in&s;tant death.</P>

The Spaniards advance &s;till farther in the coun|try, and rai&s;e a fort where Valdivia had peri&s;hed. Ercilla finds his old friend the Magician once more, who tells him that Heaven thought proper to puni&s;h the pride of the Araucanians by their late defeat; but that the Spaniards would &s;oon pay dearly for their pre&s;ent triumph. The Wizard retires after this prophecy, and, with much intrea|ty, allows Ercilla to follow him. Coming to a gloomy rock, he &s;trikes it with his wand; a &s;ecret door opens, and they enter into a delicious garden, which the Poet commends for its &s;ymmetry, ex|pre&s;sly declaring that every hedge <HI>has its brother.</HI> The Magician leads him into a vault of alaba&s;ter; and, perceiving his wi&s;h, though he does not ex|pre&s;s it, of &s;eeing the miraculous globe again, the courteous Fiton conducts him to it.</P>

defence, intreating her to receive his departing &s;pirit. He fell in the action; her father &s;hared the &s;ame fate: &s;he her&s;elf e&s;caped at a po&s;tern gate into the woods. Two negroes, laden with &s;poil, di&s;co|vered, and &s;eized her. Her cries brought a young Indian, named Cariolano, to her re&s;cue: he &s;hot an arrow into the heart of the fir&s;t ruffian, and &s;tabbed the &s;econd. Glaura expre&s;&s;ed her gratitude by receiving her young deliverer as her hu&s;band. Before they could regain a place of &s;afety, they were alarmed by the approach of Spaniards. The generous Youth intreated Glaura to conceal her|&s;elf in a tree, while he ventured to meet the ene|my. In her terror &s;he &s;ubmitted to this expedient, which, on recovery from her panic, &s;he bitterly re|pented; for when &s;he i&s;&s;ued from her retreat, &s;he &s;ought in vain for Cariolano, and &s;uppo&s;ed, from the clamour &s;he had heard, that he mu&s;t have peri&s;hed. She continued to wander in this wretched &s;tate of mind, &s;till unable to hear any tidings of her protec|tor. While the fair Indian thus clo&s;es her narra|tive, Ercilla is alarmed by the approach of a large party of Barbarians. One of his faithful Indian attendants, whom he had lately attached to him, intreats him to e&s;cape with the utmo&s;t ha&s;te; adding, that he can &s;ave him from pur&s;uit by his knowledge of the country; and that he will ri&s;que

Ercilla exclaims, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Adieu, my friends; I give you both your liberty, which is all I have at pre&s;ent to be&s;tow, and rejoins his little troop."</Q> Before he enters on the account of what followed, he relates the circum&s;tance by which he attached Cariolano to his &s;ervice; whom he had found alone, as he him&s;elf was marching with a &s;mall party, and a few pri&s;oners that he had taken. The Youth at fir&s;t defended him&s;elf, and &s;hot two Spaniards with his arrows, and continued to re&s;i&s;t the numbers that pre&s;&s;ed upon him with his mantle and his dag|ger, evading their blows by his extreme agility, and wounding &s;everal. Ercilla generou&s;ly ru&s;hed in to his re&s;cue, and declared he de&s;erved a reward for his uncommon bravery, in&s;tead of being de&s;troyed &s;o unfairly. The Youth, in con&s;equence of this treatment, flung down his dagger, and became the affectionate attendant of Ercilla. Our Poet, after relating this incident, returns to the &s;cene where his party was &s;urprized in a hollow road, and &s;e|verely galled by the enemy, who attacked them with &s;howers of &s;tones from the higher ground.

<P>Our Poet returns from this digre&s;&s;ion on Dido, to the fate of the Indian Leader Caupolican.&mdash;One of the pri&s;oners, whom the Spaniards had taken in their &s;earch after this unfortunate Chief, is at la&s;t tempted by bribes to betray his General. He conducts the Spaniards to a &s;pot near the &s;eque&s;tered retreat of Caupolican, and directs them how to di&s;cover it; but refu&s;es to advance with them, overcome by his dread of the Hero whom he is tempted to betray. The Spaniards &s;urround the hou&s;e in which the Chieftain had taken refuge with his ten faithful a&s;&s;ociates. Alarmed by a centinel, he prepares for defence; but being

He di&s;plays a calm contempt of death; but, on &s;eeing a wretched Negro appointed his executioner, his indignation bur&s;ts forth, and he hurls the Negro from the &s;caffold, entreating to die by a more honourable hand. His horrid &s;en|tence is however executed. He &s;upports the ago|nies of the &s;take with patient intrepidity, till a cho&s;en band of archers put a period to his life.</P>

<P>The con&s;equence of it was &s;uch as Caupolican foretold:&mdash;the Araucanians determine to revenge his death, and a&s;&s;emble to elect a new General.

Tunconabala meets them, as he had projected, with the appearance of extreme poverty; and, after many a&s;&s;urances of the &s;terility of that region, advi&s;es them to return, or to advance by a different path, which he repre&s;ents to them as dangerous, but the only practicable road.

He repa&s;&s;es the channel, and rejoins the Spani&s;h troops; who, after much difficulty, reach the city of Imperial. Our Poet then touches on &s;ome particulars of his per&s;onal hi&s;tory, which I men|tion in the &s;light &s;ketch of his life. He afterwards promi&s;es his reader to relate the i&s;&s;ue of the debate among the Araucanian Chieftains, on the election of their new General; but, recollecting in the in&s;tant that Spain her&s;elf is in arms, he entreats the favour of his Sovereign to in&s;pire him with new &s;pirit, that he may devote him&s;elf to that higher and more intere&s;ting &s;ubject.</P>

<P>Be|fore the appearance of Bo&s;&s;u's celebrated treati&s;e on Epic poetry, the French had a &s;imilar work written in Latin. The learned Je&s;uit Mambrun publi&s;hed, in 1652, a quarto volume, entitled, Di&s;&s;ertatic Peripatetica de Epico Carmine. His Di&s;&s;ertation is founded on the principles of Ari|&s;totle, whom he con&s;iders as infallible autho|rity; and he introduces the Greek Philo&s;opher to decide the following very curious que&s;tion, which he argues with becoming gravity, Whether

<P>The Alaric of Scudery, and the Clovis of De&s;|mare&s;ts, can &s;carce be reckoned more fortunate; but in this band of un&s;ucce&s;sful Epic writers, there was one Poet, of whom even the &s;evere Boileau could not allow him&s;elf to &s;peak ill; this was Le Moine, the author of St. Louis. The Satiri&s;t being a&s;ked, why he had never men|tioned the poetry of Le Moine? replied with the two following ver&s;es, parodied from Corneille,
<Q><L>Il s'e&s;t trop &eacute;lev&eacute; pour en dire du mal,</L>

The judicious and candid Heyne has be&s;towed con&s;iderable applau&s;e on Le Moine, in one of his notes to the 6th book of Virgil, where he examines the different methods by which the Epic Poets have introduced their various pictures of futurity. From his account, Le Moine excels in this article. I can &s;peak only from the opi|nion of this learned Critic, for the neglected French Poet is become &s;o rare, that I have &s;ought in vain for a copy of his work.&mdash;The number of ob&s;cure Epic writers in France is very trifling, compared to tho&s;e which Italy has produced; the Italians have been indefatigable in this &s;pecies of compo&s;ition, and, as if they had re&s;olved to leave no Hero un&s;ung, their celebrated Noveli&s;t, Giraldi Cinthio, has written an Epic poem, in twenty-&s;ix cantos, on the exploits of Hercules.</P>

<HEAD>NOTE XIV. VERSE 304.</HEAD>
<L><HI>Keen Boileau &s;hall not want his proper prai&s;e.</HI>]</L>
<P>Nicolas Boileau De&s;preaux was born <HI>in</HI> or <HI>near</HI> Paris, for it is a conte&s;ted point, on the fir&s;t of November 1636, and died in March 1711 of a drop&s;y, the very di&s;ea&s;e which terminated the life of his Engli&s;h rival. The Lutrin of Boileau, &s;till con&s;idered by &s;ome French Critics of the pre|&s;ent time as the be&s;t poem to which France has
<PB N="197" REF="198">
given birth, was fir&s;t publi&s;hed in 1674. It is with great rea&s;on and ju&s;tice that Voltaire confe&s;&s;es the Lutrin inferior to the Rape of the Lock. Few Poets can be &s;o properly compared as Pope and Boileau; and, wherever their writings will admit of com|pari&s;on, we may, without any national partia|lity, adjudge the &s;uperiority to the Engli&s;h Bard. The&s;e two great authors re&s;embled each other as much in the integrity of their lives, as in the &s;ub|jects and execution of their &s;everal compo&s;itions. There are two actions recorded of Boileau, which &s;ufficiently prove that the inexorable Satiri&s;t had a mo&s;t generous and friendly heart; when Patru, the celebrated Advocate, who was ruined by his pa&s;&s;ion for literature, found him&s;elf under the painful nece&s;&s;ity of &s;elling his expen&s;ive library, and had almo&s;t agreed to part with it for a mo|derate &s;um, Boileau gave him a much &s;uperior price; and, after paying the money, added this condition to the purcha&s;e, that Patru &s;hould retain, during his life, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the books. The &s;ucceeding in&s;tance of the Poet's genero&s;ity is yet nobler.&mdash;when it was rumoured at court that the King intended to retrench the pen&s;ion of Corneille, Boileau ha&s;tened to Madame de Mon|te&s;pan, and &s;aid, that his Sovereign, equitable as he was, could not, without inju&s;tice, grant a pen&s;ion to an author like him&s;elf, ju&s;t a&s;cending Parna&s;|&s;us,
<PB N="198" REF="199">
and take it from Corneille, who had &s;o long been &s;eated on the &s;ummit; that he entreated her, for the honour of the King, to prevail on his Maje&s;ty rather to &s;trike off <HI>his</HI> pen&s;ion, than to withdraw that reward from a man who&s;e title to it was incomparably greater; and that he &s;hould more ea&s;ily con&s;ole him&s;elf under the lo&s;s of that di&s;tinction, than under the affliction of &s;eeing it taken away from &s;uch a Poet as Corneille. This magnanimous application had the &s;ucce&s;s which it de&s;erved, and it appears the more noble, when we recollect that the rival of Corneille was the inti|mate friend of Boileau.</P>
<P>The long and unre&s;erved intercour&s;e which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between our Poet and Racine was highly beneficial and honourable to both. The dying farewell of the latter is the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive eulogy on the private character of Boileau: Je regarde comme un bonheur pour moi de mourir avant vous, &s;aid the tender Racine, in taking a final leave of his faithful and generous friend.</P>

<P>Though the Henriade has been frequently reprinted, and the partizans of Voltaire have endeavoured to make it a national point of honour to &s;upport its reputation, it &s;eems at length to be &s;inking under that neglect and oblivion, which never fail to over|take every feeble offspring of the Epic Mu&s;e.
<PB N="201" REF="202">
Several of our mo&s;t eminent Critics have attacked this performance with peculiar &s;everity, and &s;ome have condemned it on the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite principles, merely becau&s;e it does not coincide with their re|&s;pective &s;y&s;tems. Their &s;entence has been pa&s;&s;ed only in &s;hort and incidental remarks; but a French writer, inflamed by per&s;onal animo&s;ity again&s;t Vol|taire, has rai&s;ed three octavo volumes on the defects of this &s;ingle poem. Mr. Clement, in his "<HI>En|tretiens &s;ur le Poeme Epique relativement &agrave; la Henriade,</HI>" has endeavoured to prove it utterly deficient in all the e&s;&s;ential points of Epic poetry;&mdash;in the &s;tructure of its general plan, in the con|duct of its various parts, in &s;entiment, in character, in &s;tyle. His work indeed di&s;plays an acrimonious dete&s;tation of the Poet whom he examines; and perhaps there is hardly any human compo&s;ition which could &s;upport the &s;crutiny of &s;o rigid an in|qui&s;itor: the Henriade is utterly unequal to it; for in many articles we are obliged to confe&s;s, that the ju&s;tice of the Critic is not inferior to his &s;e|verity. He di&s;covers, in his di&s;&s;ection of the Poem, the &s;kill of an anatomi&s;t, with the malignity of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. If any thing can de&s;erve &s;uch rigorous treatment, it is certainly the artifice of Voltaire, who, in his E&s;&s;ay on Epic Poetry, has attempted, with much ingenuity, to &s;ink the reputation of all the great Epic Writers, that he might rai&s;e him&s;elf
<PB N="202" REF="203">

<HEAD>NOTE XVIII. VERSE 475.</HEAD>
<L><HI>And, &s;hrouded in a mi&s;t of moral &s;pleen.</HI>]</L>
<P>It &s;eems to be the peculiar infelicity of Pope, that his moral virtues have had a tendency to dimini&s;h his poetical reputation. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a benevolent &s;pirit, and wi&s;hing to make the art to which he devoted his life, as &s;erviceable as he could to the great intere&s;ts of mankind, he &s;oon quitted the higher regions of poetry, for the more level, and more frequented field of Ethics and of Satire. He declares, with a noble pride ari&s;ing from the pro|bity of his intention,
<Q><L>That not in Fancy's maze he wander'd long,</L>
<L>But &s;toop'd to truth, and moraliz'd his &s;ong.</L></Q>
The &s;everity of Critici&s;m has from hence inferred, that his imagination was inferior to the other fa|culties of his mind, and that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not that vigour of genius which might enable him to rank with our more &s;ublime and pathetic Bards. This
<PB N="203" REF="204">
inference appears to me extremely defective both in candour and in rea&s;on; it would &s;urely be more generous, and I will venture to add, more ju&s;t, to a&s;&s;ign very different cau&s;es for his having latterly applied him&s;elf to moral and &s;atyric com|po&s;ition. If his preceding poems di&s;played only a moderate portion of fancy and of tenderne&s;s, we might indeed very fairly conjecture, that he quitted the kind of poetry, where the&s;e qualities are parti|cularly required, becau&s;e Nature directed him to &s;hine only as the Poet of rea&s;on.&mdash;But his earlier productions will authorize an oppo&s;ite conclu&s;ion. At an age when few authors have produced any capital work, Pope gave the world two poems, one the offspring of imagination, and the other of &s;en|&s;ibility, which will ever &s;tand at the head of the two poetical cla&s;&s;es to which they belong: his Rape of the Lock, and his Eloi&s;e, have nothing to fear from any rivals, either of pa&s;t or of future time. When a writer has di&s;played &s;uch early proofs of exqui&s;ite fancy, and of tender enthu&s;ia&s;m, tho&s;e great con|&s;tituents of the real Poet, ought we not to regret that he did not give a greater &s;cope and freer exer|ci&s;e to the&s;e qualities, rather than to a&s;&s;ert that he did not po&s;&s;e&s;s them in a &s;uperlative degree? Why then, it may be a&s;ked, did he confine him&s;elf to compo&s;itions in which the&s;e have little &s;hare? The life and character of Pope will perfectly ex|plain
<PB N="204" REF="205">
the rea&s;ons, why he did not always follow the higher &s;ugge&s;tions of his own natural genius. He had entertained an opinion, that by &s;tooping to truth, and employing his talents on the vices and follies of the pa&s;&s;ing time, he &s;hould be mo&s;t able to benefit mankind. The idea was perhaps ill-founded, but his conduct in con&s;equence of-it was certainly noble. Its effects however were mo&s;t unhappy; for it took from him all his enjoyment of life, and may injure, in &s;ome degree, his immortal reputa|tion: by &s;uffering his thoughts to dwell too much on knaves and fools, he fell into the &s;plenetic delu|&s;ion, that the world is nothing but a compound of vice and folly; and from hence he has been re|proached for &s;uppo&s;ing that all human merit was confined to him&s;elf, and to a few of his mo&s;t inti|mate corre&s;pondents.</P>
<P>There was an amiable peculiarity in the charac|ter of Pope, which had great influence both on his conduct and compo&s;ition&mdash;he embraced the &s;en|timents of tho&s;e he loved with a kind of &s;uper&s;ti|tious regard; his imagination and his judgment were perpetually the dupes of an affectionate heart: it was this which led him, at the reque&s;t of his idol Bolingbroke, to write a &s;ublime poem on metaphy|&s;ical ideas which he did not perfectly comprehend; it was this which urged him almo&s;t to quarrel with Mr. Allen, in compliance with the caprices of a
<PB N="205" REF="206">
female friend; it was this which induced him, in the warmth of gratitude, to follow the ab&s;urd hints of Warburton with all the blindne&s;s of infatuated affection. Whoever examines the life and writings of Pope with a minute and unprejudiced attention, will find that his excellencies, both as a Poet and a Man, were peculiarly his own; and that his fail|ings were chiefly owing to the ill judgment, or the artifice, of his real and pretended friends. The lavi&s;h applau&s;e and the advice of his favourite At|terbury, were perhaps the cau&s;e of his pre&s;erving the famous character of Addi&s;on, which, finely written as it is, all the lovers of Pope mu&s;t wi&s;h him to have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. Few of his friends had inte|grity or frankne&s;s &s;ufficient to per&s;uade him, that his &s;atires would de&s;troy the tranquillity of his life, and cloud the lu&s;tre of his fame: yet, to the ho|nour of Lyttelton, be it remembered, that he &s;ug|ge&s;ted &s;uch ideas to the Poet, in the ver&s;es which he wrote to him from Rome, with all the becoming zeal of enlightened friend&s;hip:
<Q><L>No more let meaner Satire dim the rays</L>
<L>That flow maje&s;tic from thy nobler bays!</L>
<L>In all the flowery paths of Pindus &s;tray,</L>
<L>But &s;hun that thorny, that unplea&s;ing way!</L>
<L>Nor, when each &s;oft, engaging Mu&s;e is thine,</L>
<L>Addre&s;s the lea&s;t attractive of the Nine!</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="207">
This generous admonition did not indeed pro|duce its intended effect, for other coun&s;ellors had given a different bias to the mind of the Poet, and the malignity of his enemies had exa&s;perated his temper; yet he afterwards turned his thoughts to|wards the compo&s;ition of a national Epic poem, and po&s;&s;ibly in con&s;equence of the hint which this Epi&s;tle of Lyttelton contains. The intention was formed too late, for it aro&s;e in his decline of life. Had he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed health and lei&s;ure to execute &s;uch a work, I am per&s;uaded it would have proved a glorious acqui&s;ition to the literature of our coun|try: the &s;ubject indeed which he had cho&s;en mu&s;t be allowed to have an unpromi&s;ing appearance; but the opinion of Addi&s;on concerning his Sylphs, which was &s;urely hone&s;t, and not invidious, may teach us hardly ever to decide again&s;t the intended works of a &s;uperior genius. Yet in all the Arts, we are perpetually tempted to pronounce &s;uch de|ci&s;ions. I have frequently condemned &s;ubjects which my friend Romney had &s;elected for the pencil; but in the &s;equel, my opinion only proved that I was near-&s;ighted in tho&s;e regions of ima|gination, where his keener eyes commanded all the pro&s;pect.</P>

<P>Ari|o&s;to is &s;aid to have been publicly crowned with laurel at Mantua, by the Emperor Charles the Vth, towards the end of the year 1532. This fact has been di&s;puted by various writers, but it &s;eems to be &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed by the re|&s;earches of Mazzuchelli.</P>
<P>The cu&s;tom of crowning Poets with laurel is almo&s;t as ancient as poetry it&s;elf, &s;ays the Abb&eacute; du Re&s;nel, in his Recherches &s;ur les Poetes couronnez, a work which contains but &s;canty information on this curious topic. Petrarch is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to have revived this ancient &s;olemnity, which had been aboli&s;hed as a pagan in&s;titution in the reign of the Emperor Theodo&s;ius. It appears however, from two pa&s;&s;ages in the writings of Boccacio, that Dante had entertained &s;erious thoughts of this ho|nourable di&s;tinction, which his exile precluded him from receiving, as he cho&s;e, &s;ays his Biographer, to be crown'd only in his native city.</P>
<P>An amu&s;ing volume might be written on the honours which have been paid to Poets in different ages, and in various parts of the world. It is re|markable, that the mo&s;t unpoli&s;hed nations have been the mo&s;t lavi&s;h in rewarding their Bards.

<P>Of the great wealth which flowed into the hands of this extraordinary Poet, his friend and biogra|pher Montalvan has given a particular account. This author concludes that Lope de Vega gained by his dramatic works alone a &s;um nearly equal to 20,000 pounds &s;terling; the revenue ari&s;ing from
<PB N="214" REF="215">
the po&s;ts he held, and from his pen&s;ion, was very con&s;iderable. His opulence was much encrea&s;ed by the mo&s;t &s;plendid in&s;tances of private liberality. He received many co&s;tly pre&s;ents from various characters to whom he was per&s;onally unknown; and he was him&s;elf heard to &s;ay, in &s;peaking of his generous patron, that the Duke of Se&s;&s;a alone had given him, at different periods of his life, &s;ums al|mo&s;t amounting to &s;ix thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the noble patrons of Engli&s;h poetry have not equalled this example of Spani&s;h munificence, even if we admit the truth of our traditionary anecdotes concerning the genero|&s;ity of Lord Southampton to Shake&s;peare, and of Sir Philip Sidney to Spen&s;er. Con&s;idering the li|berality for which our nation is &s;o ju&s;tly celebrated, it is remarkable, that not a &s;ingle Engli&s;h Poet appears to have been enriched by our monarchs: yet Spen&s;er had every claim to the bounty of Eli|zabeth; he &s;ung her prai&s;es in a &s;train which might gratify her pride; and of all who have flat|tered the great, he may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as the mo&s;t worthy of reward. His &s;ong was the tribute of his heart as well as of his fancy, and the &s;ex of his idol may be &s;aid to purify his incen&s;e from all the offen&s;ive particles of &s;ervile adulation. The neglect which he experienced from the vain, im|perious,
<PB N="215" REF="216">
and ungrateful Elizabeth, appears the more &s;triking, when we recollect, that her lovely rival, the beautiful and unfortunate Queen of Scots, &s;ignalized her &s;uperior genero&s;ity by a magnificent pre&s;ent of plate to the French Poet Ron&s;ard. This neglected Bard was once the darling of France, and perhaps equalled Lope de Vega in the honours which he received: his &s;overeign, Charles the Ninth, compo&s;ed &s;ome elegant ver&s;es in his prai&s;e, and the city of Toulou&s;e pre&s;ented him with a Mi|nerva of ma&s;&s;ive &s;ilver.</P>
<P>If our princes and nobles have not equalled tho&s;e of other kingdoms in liberality to the great Poets of their country, England may yet boa&s;t the name of a private gentleman, who di&s;covered in this re|&s;pect a mo&s;t princely &s;pirit; no nation, either an|cient or modern, can produce an example of muni|ficence more truly noble then the annual gratuity which Aken&s;ide received from Mr. Dy&s;on; a tri|bute of generous and affectionate admiration, en|deared to its worthy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or by every con&s;idera|tion which could make it honourable both to him|&s;elf and to his patron!</P>
<P>It has been lately lamented by an elegant and accompli&s;hed writer, who had too much rea&s;on for the complaint, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the profe&s;&s;ion of Literature, by far the mo&s;t laborious of any, leads to no

But Rome, in her mo&s;t degenerate days, produced a writer, to who&s;e authority, contemptible as it is, mo&s;t fre|quent appeals have been made in this curious lite|rary

que&s;tion. In almo&s;t every modern author who has touched, however &s;lightly, on Epic poetry, we may find at lea&s;t &s;ome part of the following &s;en|tence from Petronius Arbiter:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">Ecce, belli civilis ingens opus qui&s;quis attigerit, ni&s;i plenus litteris, &s;ub onere labetur. Non enim res ge&s;tae ver&s;ibus comprehendendae &s;unt, quod longe melius hi&s;to|rici faciunt; &s;ed per ambages, deorumque mini&s;|teria, &amp; fabulo&s;um &s;ententiarum tormentum prae|cipitandus e&s;t liber &s;piritus; ut potius furentis animi vaticinatio appareat, quam religio&s;ae orationis &s;ub te&s;tibus fides.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e remarks on the nece&s;&s;ity of cele&s;tial a|gents, were evidently made to depreciate the Phar|&s;alia of Lucan; and Petronius may be called a fair Critic, as Pope &s;aid of Milbourne, on his oppo&s;i|tion to Dryden, becau&s;e he produces his own po|etry in contra&s;t to that which he condemns. His &s;pecimen of the manner in which he thought an Epic poem &s;hould be conducted, &s;ufficiently proves the ab&s;urdity of his critici&s;m; for how in&s;ipid is the fable in tho&s;e ver&s;es which he has oppo&s;ed to the Phar&s;alia, when compared to the fir&s;t book of Lucan! Yet the Epic compo&s;ition of Petronius has not wanted admirers: a Dutch Commentator is bold enough to &s;ay, that he prefers this &s;ingle rhap&s;ody to three hundred volumes of &s;uch poetry as
<PB N="219" REF="220">
Lucan's: an opinion which can only lead us to exclaim with Boileau,<Q>Un &s;ot trouve toujours un plus &s;ot qui l'admire.</Q></P>
<P>If men of letters, in the age of Lucan, differed in their &s;entiments concerning machinery, the great changes that have &s;ince happened in the world, and the di&s;qui&s;itions which have appeared on the &s;ub|ject, are very far from having reconciled the judg|ment of modern writers on this important article. Two eminent Critics of the pre&s;ent time have de|livered opinions on this topic &s;o &s;ingularly oppo|&s;ite to each other, that I &s;hall tran&s;cribe them both.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In a theatrical entertainment, which employs both the eye and the ear, it would be a gro&s;s ab&s;urdity to introduce upon the &s;tage &s;uperior Beings in a vi&s;ible &s;hape. There is not place for &s;uch objection in an Epic poem; and Boileau, with many other Critics, declares &s;trongly for that &s;ort of machinery in an Epic poem. But waving authority, which is apt to impo&s;e upon the judgment, let us draw what light we can from rea&s;on. I begin with a preliminary re|mark, that this matter is but indi&s;tinctly han|dled
<PB N="220" REF="221">
by Critics. The poetical privilege of ani|mating in&s;en&s;ible objects for enlivening a de&s;crip|tion, is very different from what is termed <HI>ma|chinery,</HI> where deities, angels, devils, or other &s;upernatural powers, are introduced as real per|&s;onages, mixing in the action, and contributing to the cata&s;trophe; and yet the&s;e two things are con&s;tantly jumbled together in the rea&s;on|ing. The former is founded on a natural princi|ple; but can the latter claim the &s;ame autho|rity? So far from it, that nothing is more unna|tural. Its effects at the &s;ame time are deplora|ble. Fir&s;t, it gives an air of fiction to the whole, and prevents that impre&s;&s;ion of reality which is requi&s;ite to intere&s;t our affections, and to move our pa&s;&s;ions; which of it&s;elf is &s;ufficient to explode machinery, whatever entertainment it may afford to readers of a fanta&s;tic ta&s;te or irre|gular imagination. And next, were it po&s;&s;ible, by di&s;gui&s;ing the fiction, to delude us into a notion of reality, which I think can hardly be, an in&s;uperable objection would &s;till remain, which is, that the aim or end of an Epic poem can never be attained in any perfection where machinery is introduced; for an evident rea&s;on, that virtuous emotions cannot be rai&s;ed &s;ucce&s;s|fully, but by the actions of tho&s;e who are en|dued
<PB N="221" REF="222">
with pa&s;&s;ions and affections like our own, that is, by human actions: and as for moral in|&s;truction, it is clear that none can be drawn from Beings who act not upon the &s;ame principles with us. Homer, it is true, introduces the Gods into his fable; but the religion of his country authorized that liberty; it being an article in the Grecian creed, that the Gods often interpo&s;e vi&s;ibly and bodily in human affairs. I mu&s;t, however, ob&s;erve, that Homer's Deities do no honour to his poems. Fictions that tran&s;gre&s;s the bounds of nature &s;eldom have a good effect; they may inflame the imagination for a moment, but will not be reli&s;hed by any per&s;on of a cor|rect ta&s;te. They may be of &s;ome u&s;e to the lower rank of writers; but an author of genius has much finer materials of nature's production for elevating his &s;ubject, and making it intere&s;t|ing.&mdash;Voltaire, in his E&s;&s;ay upon Epic Poe|try, talking of the Phar&s;alia, ob&s;erves judici|ou&s;ly, that the proximity of time, the notoriety of events, the character of the age, enlightened and political, joined with the &s;olidity of Lucan's &s;ubject, deprived him of all liberty of poetical fiction. Is it not amazing, that a Critic who rea&s;ons &s;o ju&s;tly with re&s;pect to others, can be &s;o
<PB N="222" REF="223">
blind with re&s;pect to him&s;elf? Voltaire, not &s;a|tisfied to enrich his language with images drawn from invi&s;ible and &s;uperior Beings, introduces them into the action. In the &s;ixth canto of the Henriade, St. Louis appears in per&s;on, and ter|rifies the &s;oldiers; in the &s;eventh canto, St. Louis &s;ends the God of Sleep to Henry; and in the tenth, the demons of Di&s;cord, Fanatici&s;m, War, &amp;c. a&s;&s;i&s;t Aumale in a &s;ingle combat with Turenne, and are driven away by a good angel brandi&s;hing the &s;word of God. To blend &s;uch fictitious per&s;onages in the &s;ame action with mortals, makes a bad figure at any rate, and is intolerable in a hi&s;tory &s;o recent as that of Henry IV. This &s;ingly is &s;ufficient to make the Hen|riade a &s;hort-lived poem, were it otherwi&s;e po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of every beauty."</Q><BIBL>&mdash;<HI>Elements of Critici&s;m,</HI> vol. ii. p. 389, 4th edition.</BIBL></P>

the Epic Poet might have recour&s;e to; but this I know&mdash;the Pomp of ver&s;e, the energy of de&s;cription, and even the fine&s;t moral paintings, would &s;tand him in no &s;tead.

<P>I have thus ventured to confront the&s;e eminent critical antagoni&s;ts, that, while they engage and overthrow each other, we may ob&s;erve the inju&s;tice produced by the &s;pirit of &s;y&s;tematical critici&s;m, even in authors mo&s;t re&s;pectable for their talents and erudition.&mdash;Here is the unfortunate Voltaire placed between two critical fires, which equally de&s;tory him. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Critic a&s;&s;erts that the Henriade mu&s;t be &s;hort-lived, becau&s;e the Poet <HI>has in|troduced invi&s;ible and &s;uperior agents;</HI>&mdash;the <HI>&s;econd</HI> denounces the &s;ame fate again&s;t it, becau&s;e <HI>it wants</HI>
<PB N="224" REF="225">
the <HI>agency of &s;uperior natures:</HI> yet &s;urely every reader of Poetry, who is not influenced by any par|ticular &s;y&s;tem, will readily allow, that if Voltaire had treated his &s;ubject with true Epic &s;pirit in all other points, neither the introduction nor the ab|&s;ence of St. Louis could be &s;ingly &s;ufficient to plunge the Henriade in oblivion. Indeed the learned author, who has &s;poken in &s;o peremptory a manner concerning the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;upernatural agents to pre&s;erve the exi&s;tence of an Epic poem, appears rather unfortunate in the two examples by which he endeavours to &s;upport his doctrine; for the Epic poems both of Davenant and Voltaire have &s;ufficient defects to account for any neglect which may be their lot, without con&s;idering the article of Machinery.</P>
<P>If I have warmly oppo&s;ed any deci&s;ions of this exalted Critic, it is from a per&s;ua&s;ion (in which I may perhaps be mi&s;taken) that <HI>&s;ome</HI> of his maxims have a &s;trong tendency to injure an art highly dear to us both; an art on which his genius and learning have ca&s;t <HI>many</HI> rays of plea&s;ing and of u&s;eful light.</P>
