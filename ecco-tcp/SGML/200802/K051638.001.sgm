<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE following Hi&s;tory is given in a Series of Letters, written princi|pally in a double, yet &s;eparate, Cor|re&s;pondence;</P>
<P>Between Two young Ladies of Virtue and Honour, bearing an inviolable Friend&s;hip for each other, and writing upon the mo&s;t intere&s;t|ing Subjects: And</P>
<P>Between Two Gentlemen of free Lives; one of them glorying in his Talents for Stratagem and Invention, and communicating to the other, in Confidence, all the &s;ecret Purpo&s;es of an in|triguing Head, and re&s;olute Heart.</P>
<P>But it is not ami&s;s to premi&s;e, for the &s;ake of &s;uch as may apprehend Hurt to the Morals of Youth from the more freely-written
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
Letters, That the Gentlemen, tho' profe&s;&s;ed Libertines as to the Fair Sex, and making it one of their wicked Maxims, to keep no Faith with any of the Individuals of it who throw them|&s;elves into their Power, are not, however, either Infidels or Scoffers: Nor yet &s;uch as think them|&s;elves freed from the Ob&s;ervance of other moral Obligations.</P>
<P>On the contrary, it will be found, in the Progre&s;s of the Collection, that they very often make &s;uch Reflections upon each other, and each upon him&s;elf, and upon his Actions, as rea&s;onable Beings, who di&s;believe not a future State of Rewards and Puni&s;hments (and who one day propo&s;e to reform) mu&s;t &s;ometimes make:&mdash;One of them actually reforming, and antidoting the Poi&s;on which &s;ome might other|wi&s;e apprehend would be &s;pread by the gayer Pen, and lighter Heart, of the other.</P>
<P>And yet that other, [altho' in unbo&s;oming him&s;elf to a <HI>&s;elect Friend,</HI> he di&s;cover Wicked|ne&s;s enough to intitle him to general Hatred] pre&s;erves a Decency, as well in his Images, as in his Language, which is not always to be found in the Works of &s;ome of the mo&s;t cele|brated modern Writers, who&s;e Subjects and Characters have le&s;s warranted the Liberties they have taken.</P>
<P>Length will be naturally expected, not only
<PB N="v" REF="4">
from what has been &s;aid, but from the follow|ing Con&s;iderations:</P>
<P>That the Letters on both Sides are written while the Hearts of the Writers mu&s;t be &s;up|po&s;ed to be wholly engaged in their Subjects: The Events at the Time generally dubious:&mdash;So that they abound, not only with critical Situ|ations; but with what may be called <HI>in&s;tanta|neous</HI> De&s;criptions and Reflections; which may be brought home to the Brea&s;t of the youthful Reader:&mdash;As al&s;o, with affecting Conver&s;ations; many of them written in the Dialogue or Dra|matic Way.</P>
<P>To which may be added, that the Collection contains not only the Hi&s;tory of the excellent Per&s;on who&s;e Name it bears, but includes The Lives, Characters, and Cata&s;trophes, of &s;everal others, either principally or incidentally con|cerned in the Story.</P>
<P>But yet the Editor [to whom it was referred to publi&s;h the Whole in &s;uch a Way as he &s;hould think would be mo&s;t acceptable to the Public] was &s;o diffident in relation to this Ar|ticle of <HI>Length,</HI> that he thought proper to &s;ub|mit the Letters to the Peru&s;al of &s;everal judi|cious Friends; who&s;e Opinion he de&s;ired of what might be be&s;t &s;pared.</P>
<P>One Gentleman, in particular, of who&s;e Know|lege,
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
Judgment, and Experience, as well as Candor, the Editor has the highe&s;t Opinion, advi&s;ed him to give a Narrative Turn to the Letters; and to publi&s;h only what concerned the principal Heroine;&mdash;&s;triking off the colla|teral Incidents, and all that related to the Second Characters; tho' he allowed the Parts which would have been by this means excluded, to be both in&s;tructive and entertaining. But being extremely fond of the affecting Story, he was de&s;irous to have every-thing parted with, which he thought retarded its Progre&s;s.</P>
<P>This Advice was not reli&s;hed by other Gentle|men. They in&s;i&s;ted, that the Story could not be reduced to a Dramatic Unity, nor thrown into the Narrative Way, without dive&s;ting it of its Warmth; and of a great Part of its Efficacy; as very few of the Reflections and Ob&s;ervations, which they looked upon as the mo&s;t u&s;eful Part of the Collection, would, then, find a Place.</P>
<P>They were of Opinion, That in all Works of This, and of the Dramatic Kind, STORY, or AMUSEMENT, &s;hould be con&s;idered as little more than the <HI>Vehicle</HI> to the more nece&s;&s;ary INSTRUCTION: That many of the Scenes would be render'd languid, were they to be made le&s;s bu&s;y: And that the Whole would be thereby deprived of that Variety, which is deemed the Soul of a Fea&s;t, whether <HI>men&s;al</HI> or <HI>mental.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="6">They were al&s;o of Opinion, That the Parts and Characters, which mu&s;t be omitted, if this Advice were followed, were &s;ome of the mo&s;t natural in the whole Collection: And no le&s;s in|&s;tructive; e&s;pecially to <HI>Youth.</HI> Which might be a Con&s;ideration perhaps overlooked by a Gen|tleman of the Advi&s;er's great Knowlege and Experience: For, as they ob&s;erved, there is a Period in human Life, in which, youthful Acti|vity cea&s;ing, and Hope contenting it&s;elf to look from its own dome&s;tic Wicket upon bounded Pro&s;pects, the half-tired Mind aims at little more than <HI>Amu&s;ement.</HI>&mdash;And with Rea&s;on; for what, in the <HI>in&s;tructive</HI> Way, can appear ei|ther <HI>new</HI> or <HI>needful</HI> to one who has happily got over tho&s;e dangerous Situations which call for Advice and Cautions, and who has fill'd up his Mea&s;ures of Knowlege to the Top?</P>
<P>Others, likewi&s;e gave <HI>their</HI> Opinions. But no Two being of the &s;ame Mind, as to the Parts which could be omitted, it was re&s;olved to pre&s;ent to the World, the Two Fir&s;t Volumes, by way of Specimen; and to be determined with regard to the re&s;t by the Reception tho&s;e &s;hould meet with.</P>
<P>If that be favourable, Two others may &s;oon follow; the whole Collection being ready for the Pre&s;s: That is to &s;ay, If it be not found ne|ce&s;&s;ary
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
to ab&s;tract or omit &s;ome of the Letters, in order to reduce the Bulk of the Whole.</P>
<P>Thus much in general. But it may not be ami&s;s to add, in particular, that in the great Variety of Subjects which this Collection con|tains, it is one of the principal Views of the Publication,
<Q><P>To caution Parents again&s;t the undue Exer|tion of their natural Authority over their Children, in the great Article of Mar|riage:</P>
<P>And Children again&s;t preferring a Man of Plea&s;ure to a Man of Probity, upon that dangerous, but too commonly received Notion, <HI>That a Reformed Rake makes the be&s;t Husband.</HI></P></Q></P>
<P>But as the Characters will not all appear in the Two Fir&s;t Volumes, it has been thought advi&s;able, in order to give the Reader &s;ome further Idea of Them, and of the Work, to prefix</P>

<P>_I AM extremely concerned, my deare&s;t friend, for the di&s;turbances that have hap|pened in your family. I know how it mu&s;t hurt you, to become the &s;ubject of the public talk: And yet, upon an occa&s;ion &s;o generally known, it is impo&s;&s;ible but that whatever relates to a young lady, who&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed merits have made her the public care, &s;hould engage every-body's attention. I long to have the particulars from your|&s;elf; and of the u&s;age I am told you receive upon an accident you could not help; and in which, as far as I can learn, the &s;ufferer was the aggre&s;&s;or.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="13">Mr. Diggs <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Her brother's &s;urgeon.</NOTE>, whom I &s;ent for at the fir&s;t hearing of the rencounter, to inquire, for <HI>your</HI> &s;ake, how your brother was, told me, That there was no danger from the wound, if there were none from the fever; which, it &s;eems, has been increa&s;ed by the perturbation of his &s;pirits.</P>
<P>Mr. Wyerley drank tea with us ye&s;terday; and tho' he is far from being partial to Mr. Lovelace, as it may be well &s;uppo&s;ed, yet both he and Mr. Symmes blame your family for the treatment they gave him, when he went in per&s;on to inquire after your bro|ther's health, and to expre&s;s his concern for what had happened.</P>
<P>They &s;ay, That Mr. Lovelace could not avoid drawing his &s;word: And that either your brother's un|&s;kilfulne&s;s or violence left him, from the very fir&s;t pa&s;s, intirely in his power. This, I am told, was what Mr. Lovelace &s;aid upon it; retreating as he &s;poke:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Have a care, Mr. Harlowe&mdash;Your violence puts you out of your defence. You give me too much ad|vantage! For your &s;i&s;ter's &s;ake, I will pa&s;s by every|thing;&mdash;if&mdash;'</Q></P>
<P>But this the more provoked his ra&s;hne&s;s, to lay him|&s;elf open to the advantage of his adver&s;ary&mdash;Who, af|ter a &s;light wound in the arm, took away his &s;word.</P>
<P>There are people who love not your brother, be|cau&s;e of his natural imperiou&s;ne&s;s, and fierce and un|controulable temper: The&s;e &s;ay, That the young gen|tleman's pa&s;&s;ion was abated, on &s;eeing his blood gu&s;h plentifully down his arm; and that he received the generous offices of his adver&s;ary, who help'd him off with his coat and wai&s;tcoat, and bound up his arm, till the &s;urgeon could come, with &s;uch patience, as was far from making a vi&s;it afterwards from that ad|ver&s;ary to inquire after his health, appear either in|&s;ulting, or improper.</P>
<P>Be this as it may, every-body pities you. So &s;teady,
<PB N="3" REF="14">
&s;o uniform in your conduct: So de&s;irous, as you al|ways &s;aid, of &s;liding through life to the end of it un|noted; and, as I may add, not wi&s;hing to be ob&s;erved even for your &s;ilent benevolence; &s;ufficiently happy in the noble con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s which rewards it: <HI>Rather u&s;eful, than glaring,</HI> your de&s;erved motto; though now pu&s;h'd into blaze, as we &s;ee, to your regret; and yet blamed at home for the faults of others;&mdash;How mu&s;t &s;uch a virtue &s;uffer on every hand!&mdash;Yet it mu&s;t be allowed, that your pre&s;ent trial is but proportion'd to your prudence!&mdash;</P>
<P>As all your friends without doors are apprehen&s;ive, that &s;ome other unhappy event may re&s;ult from &s;o vio|lent a contention, in which, it &s;eems, the families on both &s;ides are now engaged, I mu&s;t de&s;ire you to en|able me, on the authority of your own information, to do you occa&s;ional ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>My mamma, and all of us, like the re&s;t of the world, talk of nobody but you, on this occa&s;ion, and of the con&s;equences which may follow, from the re|&s;entments of a man of Mr. Lovelace's &s;pirit; who, as he gives out, has been treated with high indignity by your uncles. My mamma will have it, that you can|not now, with any decency, either &s;ee him, or corre|&s;pond with him. She is a good deal prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by your uncle Antony; who occa&s;ionally calls upon us, as you know; and, on this rencounter, has repre|&s;ented to her the crime, which it would be in a &s;i&s;ter, to encourage a man, who is to <HI>wade</HI> into her favour, (this was his expre&s;&s;ion) thro' the blood of her brother.</P>
<P>Write to me therefore, my dear, the whole of your &s;tory, from the time that Mr. Lovelace was fir&s;t intro|duce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> into your family; and particularly an account of all that pa&s;&s;ed between him and your &s;i&s;ter; about which there are different reports; &s;ome people &s;up|po&s;ing that the younger &s;i&s;ter (at lea&s;t by her uncom|mon merit) has &s;tolen a lover from the elder: And pray write in &s;o full a manner, as may gratify tho&s;e,
<PB N="4" REF="15">
who know not &s;o much of your affairs, as I do. If any thing unhappy &s;hould fall out from the violence of &s;uch &s;pirits as you have to deal with, your account of all things previous to it, will be your ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>You &s;ee what you draw upon your&s;elf, by excelling all your &s;ex: Every individual of it, who knows you, or has heard of you, &s;eems to think you an&s;werable to <HI>her</HI> for your conduct in points &s;o very delicate and concerning.</P>
<P>Every eye, in &s;hort, is upon you, with the expecta|tion of an example. I wi&s;h to heaven you were at liberty to pur&s;ue your own methods: All would then, I dare &s;ay, be ea&s;y, and honourably ended. But I dread your directors and directre&s;&s;es: for your mamma, admirably well qualified as &s;he is to lead, mu&s;t &s;ub|mit to be led. Your &s;i&s;ter and brother will certainly put you out of your cour&s;e.</P>
<P>But this is a point you will not permit me to ex|patiate upon: Pardon me therefore, and I have done.&mdash;Yet, why &s;hould I &s;ay, Pardon me? When your concerns are my concerns? When your honour is my honour? When I love you, as never woman loved another? And when you have allowed of that concern and of that love; and have for years, which in per&s;ons &s;o young, may be called many, ranked in the fir&s;t cla&s;s of your friends,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your ever-grateful and affectionate ANNA HOWE?</SIGNED>
<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>Will you oblige me with a copy of the preamble to the clau&s;es in your grandfather's will in your favour; and allow me to &s;end it to my aunt Harman?&mdash;She is very de&s;irous to &s;ee it. Yet your character has &s;o charm'd her, that, tho' a &s;tranger to you per&s;onally, &s;he a&s;&s;ents to the pre|ference given you in it, before &s;he knows his rea&s;ons for that preference.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Harlowe-Place, <DATE>Jan. 13.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HOW you oppre&s;s me, my deare&s;t friend, with your politene&s;s! I cannot doubt your &s;incerity; but you &s;hould take care, that you give me not rea|&s;on, from your kind partiality, to call in que&s;tion your judgment. You do not di&s;tingui&s;h, that I take many admirable hints from you, and have the art to pa&s;s them upon you for my own: For in all you do, in all you &s;ay, nay, in your very looks (&s;o animated!), you give le&s;&s;ons, to one who loves you and ob&s;erves you, as I love and ob&s;erve you, without knowing that you do:&mdash;So, pray, my dear, be more &s;paring of your prai&s;e for the future, le&s;t, after this confe&s;&s;ion, we &s;hould &s;u&s;pect, that you &s;ecretly intend to prai&s;e your|&s;elf, while you would be thought only to commend another.</P>
<P>Our family has indeed been &s;trangely di&s;compo&s;ed.&mdash;<HI>Di&s;compo&s;ed!</HI>&mdash;It has been in <HI>tumults,</HI> ever &s;ince the unhappy tran&s;action; and I have borne all the blame; yet &s;hould have had too much concern, from my&s;elf, had I been more ju&s;tly &s;pared by every one el&s;e.</P>
<P>For, whether it be owing to a faulty impatience, having been too indulgently treated to be <HI>inured</HI> to blame, or to the regret I have to hear tho&s;e cen&s;ured on my account, whom it is my duty to vindicate; I have &s;ometimes wi&s;hed, that it had plea&s;ed God to have taken me in my la&s;t fever, when I had every|body's love, and good opinion; but oftener, that I had never been di&s;tingui&s;hed by my grandpapa as I was: Which has e&s;tranged from me, I doubt, my brother's and &s;i&s;ter's affections; at lea&s;t, has rai&s;ed a jealou&s;y, with regard to the apprehended favour of my two uncle, that now-and-then over&s;hadows their love.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="17">My brother being happily recover'd of his fever, and his wound in a hopeful way, altho' he has not yet ven|tured abroad, I will be as particular as you de&s;ire in the little hi&s;tory you demand of me.

<P>I will begin, as you command, with Mr. Lovelace's addre&s;s to my &s;i&s;ter; and be as brief as po&s;&s;ible. I will recite facts only; and leave you to judge of the truth of the report rai&s;ed, that the younger &s;i&s;ter has robbed the elder.</P>
<P>It was in pur&s;uance of a conference between Lord M. and my uncle Antony, that Mr. Lovelace (my papa and mamma not forbidding) paid his re&s;pects to my &s;i&s;ter Arabella. My brother was then in Scotland, bu&s;ying him&s;elf in viewing the condition of the con|&s;iderable e&s;tate which was left him there by his gene|rous godmother, together with one as con&s;iderable in York&s;hire.

<P>My &s;i&s;ter made me a vi&s;it there the day after Mr. Lovelace had been introduced; and &s;eemed highly plea&s;ed with the gentleman. His birth, his fortune in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, a clear 2000 <HI>l. per annum,</HI> as Lord M. had a&s;&s;ured my uncle; pre&s;umptive heir to that nobleman's large e&s;tate: His great expectations from Lady Sarah

<P>I congratulated her upon her pro&s;pects. She re|ceived my compliments with a great deal of &s;elf-com|placency.</P>
<P>She liked the gentleman &s;till more at his next vi&s;it: And yet he made no particular addre&s;s to her; altho' an opportunity was given him for it. This was won|der'd at, as my uncle had introduced him into our family, declaredly as a vi&s;itor to my &s;i&s;ter.

<P>Thus, however, could my &s;i&s;ter make it out&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Upon her word, &s;he believed Mr. Lovelace de&s;erved not the bad character he had as to women. He was really, to <HI>her</HI> thinking, a <HI>mode&s;t</HI> man.

<P>But now &s;he began to be di&s;&s;atisfied with him: She compared his general character, with This his par|ticular behaviour to her; and, having never been courted before, own'd her&s;elf puzzled, how to deal with &s;o odd a lover.

<P>I was not of her council. I was &s;till ab&s;ent. And it was agreed between my aunt Hervey and her, that &s;he was to be quite &s;olemn and &s;hy in his next vi&s;it, if there were not a peculiarity in his addre&s;s to her.</P>
<P>But my &s;i&s;ter, it &s;eems, had not con&s;ider'd the mat|ter well.

<P>How they managed it in this conver&s;ation I know not: One would be tempted to think by the i&s;&s;ue, that Mr. Lovelace was ungenerous enough to &s;eek the occa&s;ion given <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Mr. <HI>Lovelace</HI>'s Letter, <HI>N^o. xxxi.</HI> in which he briefly accounts for his conduct in this affair.</NOTE>, and to improve it.

her denial: Yet gave him rea&s;on to think, that &s;he did not di&s;like his addre&s;s, only the <HI>manner</HI> of it; his court being rather made to her mamma than to her|&s;elf, as if he were &s;ure of <HI>her</HI> con&s;ent at any time.</P>
<P>A good encouraging denial, I mu&s;t own:&mdash;As was the re&s;t of her plea; to wit,

A good inten|tional preparative, this pity; &s;ince, at the time, &s;he lit|tle thought that he would not renew his offer.</P>
<P>He waited on my mamma, after he had taken leave of Bella, and reported his ill &s;ucce&s;s, in &s;o re&s;pect|ful a manner, both with regard to my &s;i&s;ter, and to the whole family, and with &s;o much concern that he was not accepted as a relation to it, that it left upon them all (my brother being then, as I have &s;aid, in Scotland) impre&s;&s;ions in his favour; and a belief, that this matter would certainly be brought on again.

<P><PB N="13" REF="24">But when Mr. Lovelace return'd into the country, he thought fit to vi&s;it my papa and mamma; hoping, as he told them, that, however unhappy he had been in the rejection of the wi&s;h'd-for alliance; he might be allowed to keep up an acquaintance and friend&s;hip with a family which he &s;hould always re&s;pect. And then, unhappily, as I may &s;ay, was I at home, and pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>It was immediately ob&s;erved, that his attention was fixed on me. My &s;i&s;ter, as &s;oon as he was gone, in a &s;pirit of bravery, &s;eem'd de&s;irous to promote his addre&s;s, &s;hould it be tendered.</P>
<P>My aunt Hervey was there; and was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, We &s;hould make the fine&s;t couple in England; if my &s;i&s;ter had no objection.&mdash;No, indeed, with a haughty to&s;s, was my &s;i&s;ter's reply!&mdash;It would be &s;trange if &s;he had, after the denial &s;he had given him upon full deli|beration.</P>
<P>My mamma declared, That her only di&s;like of his alliance with either daughter, was on account of his faulty morals.</P>
<P>My uncle Harlowe, That his <HI>daughter</HI> Clary, as he delighted to call me from childhood, would reform him, if any woman in the world could.</P>
<P>My uncle Antony gave his approbation in high terms: But referr'd, as my aunt had done, to my &s;i&s;ter.</P>

<P>My papa, indeed, after a long &s;ilence, being urged to &s;peak his mind, by my uncle Antony, &s;aid, That he had a letter from his &s;on James, on his hearing of Mr. Lovelace's vi&s;its to his daughter Arabella; which he had not &s;hewn to any-body but my mamma; that

treaty being at an end when he received it: That in this letter he expre&s;&s;ed great di&s;likes to an alliance with Mr. Lovelace, on the &s;core of his immoralities: That he knew, indeed, there was an old grudge between them: That, being de&s;irous to prevent all occa|&s;ions of di&s;union and animo&s;ity in his family, he would &s;u&s;pend the declaration of his own mind, till his &s;on arrived, and till he had heard his further objections: That he was the more inclined to make his &s;on this compliment, as Mr. Lovelace's general character gave but too much ground for his &s;on's di&s;like of him; adding, That he had heard, (So, he &s;uppo&s;ed, had every-one) that he was a very extravagant man: that he had contracted debts in his travels: And, indeed, he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, he had the air of a &s;pendthrift.</P>
<P>The&s;e particulars I had partly from my aunt Her|vey, and partly from my &s;i&s;ter; for I was called out, as &s;oon as the &s;ubject was entered upon. And, when I returned, my uncle Antony a&s;ked me, How <HI>I</HI> &s;hould like Mr. Lovelace? Every-body &s;aw, he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that I had made a conque&s;t.</P>
<P>I immediately an&s;wered, Not at all: He &s;eemed to have too good an opinion both of his per&s;on and parts, to have any great regard to his wife, let him marry whom he would.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter, particularly, was plea&s;ed with this an&s;wer, and confirmed it to be ju&s;t; with a compliment to my judgment:&mdash;For it was <HI>hers.</HI></P>
<P>But the very next day Lord M. came to Harlowe-Place: I was then ab&s;ent: And, in his nephew's name, made a propo&s;al in form; declaring, That it was the ambition of all his family to be related to ours: And he hoped his kin&s;man would not have &s;uch an an&s;wer on the part of the younger &s;i&s;ter, as he had had on that of the elder.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, Mr. Lovelace's vi&s;its were admitted, as tho&s;e of a man who had not de&s;erved di&s;re&s;pect from our family; but, as to his addre&s;s to me, with a
<PB N="15" REF="26">
re&s;ervation, as above, on my papa's part, that he would determine nothing without his &s;on. My di&s;cretion, as to the re&s;t, was confided in: For &s;till I had the &s;ame objections as to the man: Nor would I, when we were better acquainted, hear any-thing but general talk from him; giving him no opportunity of conver&s;ing with me in private.</P>
<P>He bore this with a re&s;ignation little expected from his natural temper, which is generally reported to be quick and ha&s;ty; unu&s;ed, it &s;eems, from childhood, to check or controul: A ca&s;e too common in con&s;iderable families, where there is an only &s;on: And <HI>his</HI> mother never had any other child. But, as I have hereto|fore told you, I could perceive, notwith&s;tanding this re&s;ignation, that he had &s;o good an opinion of him&s;elf, as not to doubt, that his per&s;on and accompli&s;hments would in&s;en&s;ibly engage me: And could That be once done, he told my aunt Hervey, he &s;hould hope from &s;o &s;teady a temper, that his hold in my affections would be durable: While my &s;i&s;ter accounted for his patience in another manner, which would perhaps have had more force, if it had come from a per&s;on le&s;s preju|diced:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That the man was not fond of marrying at all: That he might perhaps have half-a-&s;core mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es; and that delay might be as convenient for his <HI>roving,</HI> as for my <HI>well-acted</HI> indifference.'</Q>
&mdash;That was her kind expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Whatever were his motive for a patience &s;o gene|rally believed to be out of his u&s;ual character, and where the object of his addre&s;s was &s;uppo&s;ed to be of fortune con&s;iderable enough to engage his warme&s;t attention, he certainly e&s;caped many mortifications by it: For while my papa &s;u&s;pended his approbation till my brother's arrival, he received from every-one tho&s;e civilities which were due to his birth: And altho' we heard, from time to time, reports to his di&s;advantage with regard to morals; yet could we not que&s;tion him upon them, without giving him greater advantages,

than the &s;ituation he was in with us would ju&s;tify to prudence; &s;ince it was much more likely, that his addre&s;s would <HI>not</HI> be allowed of, than that it <HI>would.</HI></P>
<P>And thus was he admitted to conver&s;e with our family, almo&s;t upon his own terms; for while my friends &s;aw nothing in his behaviour but what was ex|tremely re&s;pectful, and ob&s;erved in him no violent importunity, they &s;eemed to have taken a great liking to his conver&s;ation: While I con&s;idered him only as a a common gue&s;t, when he came; and thought my&s;elf no more concerned in his vi&s;its, nor at his entrance or departure, than any other of the family.</P>
<P>But this indifference of my &s;ide was the means of procuring him one very great advantage; for upon it was grounded that corre&s;pondence by letters, which &s;ucceeded;&mdash;and which, had it been to be begun, when the family-animo&s;ity broke out, would never have been entered into on my part. The occa&s;ion was this:</P>
<P>My uncle Hervey has a young gentleman intru&s;ted to his care, whom he has thoughts of &s;ending abroad, a year or two hence, to make the Grand Tour, as it is called; and, finding Mr. Lovelace could give a good account of every-thing nece&s;&s;ary for a young traveller to ob&s;erve upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, he de&s;ired him to write down a de&s;cription of the courts and countries he had vi&s;ited; and what was mo&s;t worthy of curio&s;ity in them.</P>
<P>He con&s;ented, on condition that I would <HI>direct</HI> his &s;ubjects, as he called it: And, as every-one had heard his manner of writing commended; and thought his relations might be agreeable amu&s;ements in winter evenings; and that he could have no opportunity par|ticularly to addre&s;s me in them, &s;ince they were to be read in full a&s;&s;embly, before they were to be given to the young gentleman; I made the le&s;s &s;cruple to write, and to make ob&s;ervations, and put que&s;tions, for our further information&mdash;Still the le&s;s, perhaps, as I love writing; and tho&s;e who do, are fond, you know, of

occa&s;ions to u&s;e the pen: And then, having every one's con&s;ent, and my uncle Hervey's de&s;ire that I would, I thought, that if I had been the only &s;crupu|lous per&s;on, it would have &s;hewn a particularity, that a vain man would con&s;true to his advantage; and which my &s;i&s;ter would not fail to animadvert upon.</P>
<P>You have &s;een &s;ome of the&s;e letters; and have been plea&s;ed with his account of per&s;ons, places, and things; and we have both agreed, that he was no common ob&s;erver upon what he had &s;een.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter her&s;elf allowed, that the man had a tole|rable knack of writing and de&s;cribing: And my papa, who had been abroad in his youth, &s;aid, That his remarks were curious, and &s;hewed him to be a per&s;on of reading, judgment, and ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Thus was a kind of corre&s;pondence begun between him and me, with general approbation; while every|one wonder'd at, and was plea&s;ed with, his patient veneration of me; for &s;o they called it. However, it was not doubted, that he would &s;oon be more impor|tunate; &s;ince his vi&s;its were more frequent, and he acknowleged to my aunt Hervey a pa&s;&s;ion for me, accompany'd with an awe, that he had never known before; to which he attributed what he called his but <HI>&s;eeming</HI> acquie&s;cence with my papa's plea&s;ure, and the di&s;tance I kept him at. And yet, my dear, this may be his u&s;ual manner of behaviour to our &s;ex; for had not my &s;i&s;ter, at fir&s;t, all his reverences?</P>
<P>Mean time, my father, expecting this importunity, kept in readine&s;s the reports he had heard in his di&s;|favour, to charge them upon him then, as &s;o many objections to his addre&s;s. And it was highly agree|able to me, that he did &s;o: It would have been &s;trange, if it were not; &s;ince the per&s;on who could reject Mr. Wyerley's addre&s;s for the &s;ake of his <HI>free opinions,</HI> mu&s;t have been inexcu&s;able, had &s;he not re|jected another's for his <HI>freer practices.</HI></P>
<P>But I &s;hould own, that in the letters he &s;ent me,
<PB N="18" REF="29">
upon the general &s;ubject, he more than once inclo&s;ed a particular one, declaring his pa&s;&s;ionate regards for me, and complaining, with fervour enough, of my re|&s;erves: But of the&s;e I took not the lea&s;t notice; for as I had not written to him at all, but upon a &s;ubject &s;o general, I thought it was but right, to let what he wrote upon one &s;o particular, pa&s;s off as if I never had &s;een it; and the rather, as I was not then at li|berty, from the approbation his letters met with, to break off the corre&s;pondence, without a&s;&s;igning the true rea&s;on for doing &s;o. Be&s;ides, with all his re&s;pectful a&s;&s;i|duities, it was ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, (if it had not been his general character) that his temper is naturally haughty and violent; and I had &s;een enough of that untract|able &s;pirit in my brother, to like it in one who hoped to be &s;till nearer related to me.</P>
<P>I had a little &s;pecimen of this temper of his, upon the very occa&s;ion I have mentioned: For, after he had &s;ent me a third particular letter with the general one, he a&s;ked me, the next time he came to Harlowe-Place, If I had not received &s;uch a one from him?&mdash;I told him, I &s;hould never an&s;wer one, &s;o &s;ent; and, that I had waited for &s;uch an occa&s;ion as he had now given me, to tell him &s;o: I de&s;ired him therefore not to write again on the &s;ubject; a&s;&s;uring him, that if he did, I would return both, and never write another line to him.</P>
<P>You cannot imagine how &s;aucily the man looked; as if, in &s;hort, he was di&s;appointed, that he had not made a more &s;en&s;ible impre&s;&s;ion upon me: And when he recollected him&s;elf (as he did immediately), what a vi&s;ible Struggle it co&s;t him to change his haughty airs for more placid ones. But I took no no|tice of either; for I thought it be&s;t to convince him, by the coolne&s;s and indifference, with which I repul&s;ed his forward hopes (at the &s;ame time intending to avoid the affectation of pride or vanity), that he was not con&s;iderable enough in my eyes to make me take over-ready offence at what he &s;aid, or how he looked:
<PB N="19" REF="30">
In other words, that I had not value enough for him, to treat him with peculiarity either by &s;miles or frowns. Indeed, he had cunning enough to give me, unde&s;ign|edly, a piece of in&s;truction which taught me this cau|tion; for he had &s;aid in conver&s;ation once,

<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Jan. 15.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THIS, my dear, was the &s;ituation Mr. Lovelace and I were in, when my brother arrived from Scotland.</P>
<P>The moment Mr. Lovelace's vi&s;its were mentioned to him, he, without either he&s;itation or apology, ex|pre&s;&s;ed his di&s;approbation of them. He found great flaws in his character; and took the liberty to &s;ay, in &s;o many words, That he wondered, how it came into the hearts of his uncles to encourage &s;uch a man for <HI>either</HI> of his &s;i&s;ters: At the &s;ame time returning his thanks to my father for declining his con&s;ent till <HI>he</HI> arrived, in &s;uch a manner, I thought, as a &s;uperior would do, when he commended an inferior, for have|ing well performed his duty in his ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>He ju&s;tified his avowed inveteracy, by common fame, and by what he had known of him at college; declaring, That he had ever hated him; ever &s;hould hate him; and would never own him for a brother, or me for a &s;i&s;ter; if I married him.</P>
<P>That college-begun antipathy I have heard ac|counted for in this manner:</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="31">Mr. Lovelace was always noted for his vivacity and courage; and no le&s;s, it &s;eems, for the &s;wift and &s;ur|pri&s;ing progre&s;s he made in all parts of literature: For diligence in his &s;tudies, in the hours of &s;tudy, he had hardly his equal. This, it &s;eems, was his general character at the univer&s;ity; and it gained him many friends among the more learned youth; while tho&s;e who did not love him, feared him, by rea&s;on of the offence his vivacity made him too ready to give, and of the courage he &s;hewed in &s;upporting the offence when given; which procured him as many followers as he plea&s;ed among the mi&s;chievous &s;ort.&mdash;No very amiable character, you'll &s;ay, upon the whole.</P>
<P>But my brother's temper was not happier. His native haughtine&s;s could not bear a &s;uperiority &s;o vi|&s;ible; and whom we fear more than love, we are not far from hating: And, having le&s;s command of his pa&s;&s;ions, than the other, was evermore the &s;ubject of his, perhaps <HI>indecent,</HI> ridicule: So, that they never me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> without quarreling: And every-body, either from love or fear, &s;iding with his antagoni&s;t, he had a mo&s;t unea&s;y time of it, while both continued in the &s;ame college.&mdash;It was the le&s;s wonder, the efore, that a young man, who is not noted for the gentlene&s;s of his temper, &s;hould re&s;ume an antipathy early begun, and &s;o deeply-rooted.</P>
<P>He found my &s;i&s;ter, who waited but for the occa&s;ion, ready to join him in his re&s;entments again&s;t the man he hated. She utterly di&s;claimed all manner of regard for him:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Never liked him at all:&mdash;His e&s;tate was certainly much incumber'd: It was impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e; &s;o intirely devoted as he was to his plea&s;ures. He kept no hou&s;e; had no equipage: Nobody pretended that he wanted pride: The rea&s;on therefore was ea&s;y to be gue&s;&s;ed at.'</Q>
And then did &s;he boa&s;t of, and my brother prai&s;e her for, refu&s;ing him: And both joined on all occa&s;ions to depreciate him, and not &s;eldom <HI>made</HI> the occa&s;ions; their di&s;|plea&s;ure
<PB N="21" REF="32">
again&s;t him cau&s;ing every &s;ubject to run into this, if it began not with it.</P>
<P>I was not &s;olicitous to vindicate him, when I was not joined in their reflections. I told them, I did not value him enough to make a difference in the family on his account: And as he was &s;uppo&s;ed to have given too much cau&s;e for their ill opinion of him, I thought he ought to take the con&s;equence of his own faults.</P>
<P>Now-and-then, indeed, when I ob&s;erved, that their vehemence carried them beyond all bounds of proba|bility, I thought it but ju&s;tice to put in a word for him. But this only &s;ubjected me to reproach, as have|ing a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in his favour that I would not own.&mdash;So that when I could not change the &s;ubject, I u&s;ed to retire either to my mu&s;ic, or to my clo&s;et.</P>
<P>Their behaviour to him, when they could not help &s;eeing him, was very cold and di&s;obliging; but, as yet, not directly affrontive: For they were in hopes of prevailing upon my papa to forbid his vi&s;its. But, as there was nothing in his behaviour, that might war|rant &s;uch a treatment of a man of his birth and fortune, they &s;ucceeded not: And then they were very earne&s;t with <HI>me</HI> to forbid them. I a&s;k'd, What authority I had to take &s;uch a &s;tep in my father's hou&s;e; and when my behaviour to him was &s;o di&s;tant, that he &s;eemed to be as much the gue&s;t of any other per&s;on of the family, them&s;elves excepted, as mine?&mdash;In revenge, they told me, That it was cunning management be|tween us; and that we both under&s;tood one another better than we pretended to do. And at la&s;t, they gave &s;uch a loo&s;e to their pa&s;&s;ions, all of a &s;udden <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The rea&s;on of this their more-openly &s;hewn animo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty is given in <HI>letter xiii.</HI></NOTE>, as I may &s;ay, that in&s;tead of withdrawing, as they u&s;ed to do when he came, they threw them&s;elves in his way, purpo&s;ely to affront him.</P>
<P>Mr. Lovelace, you may believe, very ill brooked
<PB N="22" REF="33">
this: But, neverthele&s;s, contented him&s;elf to complai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of it to me: In high terms, however; telling me, that but for my &s;ake, my brother's treatment of him was not to be borne.</P>
<P>I was &s;orry for the merit this gave him, in his own opinion, with me: And the more as &s;ome of the af|fronts he received, were too flagrant to be excu&s;ed: But I told him, That I was determin'd not to fall out with my brother, if I could help it, whatever were his faults: And, &s;ince they could not &s;ee one another with temper, &s;hould be glad, that he would not throw him&s;elf in my brother's way; and I was &s;ure my brother would not &s;eek <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>He was very much nettled at this an&s;wer: But &s;aid, He mu&s;t bear his affronts, if I would have it &s;o. He had been accu&s;ed him&s;elf of violence in his temper: But he hoped to &s;hew on this occa&s;ion, that he had a command of his pa&s;&s;ions, which few young men, &s;o provoked, would be <HI>able</HI> to &s;hew; and doubted not, but it would be attributed to a <HI>proper motive</HI> by a per|&s;on of my genero&s;ity and penetration.</P>
<P>My brother had ju&s;t before, with the approbation of my uncles, employ'd a per&s;on related to a di&s;charged bailiff or &s;teward of Lord M. who had had the manage|ment of &s;ome part of Mr. Lovelace's affairs (from which he was al&s;o di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by him), to inquire into his debts; after his companions; into his amours; and the like.</P>
<P>My aunt Hervey, in confidence, gave me the fol|lowing particulars of what the man &s;aid of him.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That he was a generous landlord: That he &s;pared nothing for &s;olid and la&s;ting improvements upon his e&s;tate: And that he looked into his own affairs, and under&s;tood them: That he had, when abroad, been very expen&s;ive; and contracted a large debt (for he made no &s;ecret of his affairs); yet cho&s;e to limit him&s;elf to an annual &s;um, and to decline equi|page, in order to avoid being obliged to his uncle and aunts; from whom he might have what money
<PB N="23" REF="34">
he plea&s;ed; but that he was very jealous of their controul; had often quarrels with them, and treated them &s;o freely, that they were all afraid of him. However, that his e&s;tate was never mortgaged, as my brother had heard it was; his credit was always high; and, he believed, he was by this time, near upon, if not quite, clear of the world.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'He was a &s;ad gentleman, he &s;aid, as to women:&mdash;If his tenants had pretty daughters, they cho&s;e to keep them out of his &s;ight. He believed, he kept no particular mi&s;tre&s;s; for he had heard <HI>newelty,</HI> that was the man's word, was every-thing with him. But for his uncle's and aunts teazings, fan&s;y'd he would not think of marriage: Was never known to be di&s;gui&s;ed with liquor: But was a great plotter, and a great writer: That he lived a wild life in town, by what he had heard: Had &s;ix or &s;even com|panions as bad as him&s;elf; whom now-and-then he brought down with him; and the country was al|ways glad when they went up again. He would have it, that, altho' pa&s;&s;ionate, he was good-humour'd; loved as well to take a je&s;t, as to give one, and would railly him&s;elf, upon occa&s;ion, the free&s;t of any man he ever knew.'</Q></P>
<P>This was his character from an enemy; for, as my aunt ob&s;erved, every thing the man &s;aid commendably of him, came grudgingly, with a <HI>Mu&s;t needs &s;ay&mdash;To do him ju&s;tice,</HI> &amp;c. while the contrary was delivered with a free good-will. And this character, as a wor&s;e was expected, tho' This was bad enough, not an&s;wer|ing the end of inquiring after it, my brother and &s;i&s;ter were more apprehen&s;ive than before, that his addre&s;s would be encouraged: &s;ince the wor&s;t part of it was known, or &s;uppo&s;ed, when he was fir&s;t introduced to my &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>But, with regard to my&s;elf, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve in his disfavour, that, notwith&s;tanding the merit he wanted to make with me, for his patience upon my brother's
<PB N="24" REF="35">
ill-treatment of him, I owed him no compliments for trying to conciliate with <HI>him.</HI> Not that I believe it would have &s;ignified any thing, if he had made ever &s;uch court, either to him, or to my &s;i&s;ter: Yet one might have expected, from a man of his politene&s;s, and from his preten&s;ions, you know, that he would have been willing to <HI>try.</HI> In&s;tead of which, &s;uch a hearty contempt he &s;hew'd of them both, of my bro|ther e&s;pecially, that I ever heard of it with aggrava|tions. And for me to have hinted at an alteration in his behaviour to my brother, was an advantage I knew he would have been proud of; and which therefore I had no mind to give him.&mdash;But I doubted not, that having &s;o very little encouragement from <HI>any</HI>-body, his pride would &s;oon take fire, and he would of him|&s;elf di&s;continue his vi&s;its, or go to town; where, till he came acquainted with our family, he u&s;ed chiefly to re&s;ide: And in this latter ca&s;e he had no rea&s;on to expect, that I would <HI>receive,</HI> much le&s;s <HI>an&s;wer,</HI> his letters; the occa&s;ion, which had led me to receive <HI>any</HI> of his, being by this time over.</P>
<P>But my brother's antipathy would not permit him to <HI>wait</HI> for &s;uch an event; and after &s;everal exce&s;&s;es, which Mr. Lovelace &s;till return'd with contempt, and a haughtine&s;s too much like that of the aggre&s;&s;or, my brother took upon him&s;elf to fill up the door-way, once, when he came, as if to oppo&s;e his entrance: and, upon his a&s;king for me, demanded, What his bu&s;ine&s;s were with his &s;i&s;ter?</P>
<P>The other, with a challenging air, as my brother &s;ays, told him, He would an&s;wer a gentleman <HI>any</HI> que&s;tion: But he wi&s;hed, that Mr. James Harlowe, who had of late given him&s;elf high airs, would remem|ber, that he was not <HI>now</HI> at college.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then the good Dr. Lewin, who frequently ho|nours me with a <HI>vi&s;it of conver&s;ation,</HI> as he is plea&s;ed to call it, and had parted with me in my own parlour, came to the door; and, hearing the words, inter|po&s;ed;
<PB N="25" REF="36">
both having their hands upon their &s;words: And telling Mr. Lovelace where I was, he bur&s;t by my brother, to come to me; leaving him chafing, he &s;aid, like a hunted boar at bay.</P>
<P>This alarm'd us all. My father was plea&s;ed to hint to Mr. Lovelace; and I, by his command, &s;poke a great deal plainer; that he wi&s;h'd he would di&s;con|tinue his vi&s;its, for the peace-&s;ake of the family.</P>
<P>But Mr. Lovelace is not a man to be ea&s;ily brought to give up his purpo&s;e, in a point, e&s;pecially, wherein he pretends his heart is &s;o much engag'd: And an ab&s;olute prohibition not having been given, things went on for a little while as before: For I &s;aw plainly, that to have deny'd my&s;elf to his vi&s;its (which, how|ever, I declin'd receiving, as often as I could) was to bring forward &s;ome de&s;perate i&s;&s;ue between the two; &s;ince the offence &s;o readily given on one &s;ide, was only brooked by the other, out of con&s;ideration to me. And thus did my brother's ra&s;hne&s;s lay me un|der an obligation where I would lea&s;t have ow'd it.</P>
<P>The intermediate propo&s;als of Mr. Symmes and Mr. Mullins, both (in turn) encouraged by my brother, were inducements for him to be more patient for a while; he being in hopes, as no-body thought me over-forward in Mr. Lovelace's favour, that he &s;hould engage my father and uncles to e&s;pou&s;e the one or the other in oppo&s;ition to <HI>him.</HI> But when he found, that I had intere&s;t enough to di&s;engage my&s;elf from their addre&s;&s;es, as I had (before he went to Scotland, and, before Mr. Lovelace vi&s;ited here) of Mr. Wyerley's, he then kept no mea&s;ures: And fir&s;t &s;et him&s;elf to upbraid me for a &s;uppo&s;ed prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; which he treated, as if it were criminal: And then to in&s;ult Mr. Lovelace in per&s;on. And it being at Mr. Edward Symmes's, the brother of the other Symmes, two miles off, and no good Dr. Lewin again to interpo&s;e, the unhappy rencounter follow'd. My brother was di&s;arm'd in it, as you have heard; and on being
<PB N="26" REF="37">
brought home, and giving us ground to &s;uppo&s;e he was much wor&s;e hurt than he really was, and a fever en&s;uing, every-one flam'd out; and all was laid at my door.</P>
<P>Mr. Lovelace, for three days together, &s;ent twice each day to inquire after my brother's health; and, altho' he received rude, and even &s;hocking returns, he thought fit, on the fourth day, to make in per&s;on the fame inquiries; and received &s;till greater incivilities from my two uncles, who happen'd to be both there. My papa al&s;o was held by force from going to him with his &s;word in his hand, altho' he had the gout upon him.</P>
<P>I fainted away with terror, &s;eeing every-one &s;o violent; and hearing his voice, &s;wearing he would not depart without &s;eeing me, or making my uncles a&s;k his pardon for the indignities he had received at their hands: A door being al&s;o held fa&s;t lock'd between them; my mamma &s;truggling with my papa; and my &s;i&s;ter, after treating him with virulence, in&s;ulting me, as fa&s;t as I recover'd. But, when he was told how ill I was, he departed, vowing revenge.</P>
<P>He was ever a favourite with our dome&s;tics. His bounty to them, and having always &s;omething facetious to &s;ay to each, had made them all of his party: And on this occa&s;ion they privately blamed every-body el&s;e, and reported his patience and gentlemanly behaviour (till the provocations given him ran very high) in &s;uch favourable terms, that tho&s;e reports, and my apprehen|&s;ions of the con&s;equence of this treatment, induced me to <HI>read a letter</HI> he &s;ent me that night; and, it being written in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful terms, offering to &s;ubmit the whole to my deci&s;ion, and to govern him&s;elf in|tirely by my will, <HI>to an&s;wer</HI> it &s;ome days after.</P>
<P>To this unhappy nece&s;&s;ity was owing our renewed corre&s;pondence, as I may call it: Yet I did not write, till I had inform'd my&s;elf from Mr. Symmes's brother, that he was really in&s;ulted into the act of drawing his
<PB N="27" REF="38">
&s;word, by my brother's repeatedly threatening, upon his excu&s;ing him&s;elf out of regard to me, to brand him if he did not; and, by all the inquiry I could make, that he was again the &s;ufferer from my uncles, in a more violent manner than I have related.</P>
<P>The &s;ame circum&s;tances were related to my papa, and other friends, by Mr. Symmes; but they had gone too far, in making them&s;elves parties to the quarrel, either to retract or forgive; and I was forbid corre|&s;ponding with him, or to be &s;een a moment in his company.</P>
<P>But one thing I can &s;ay, but that in confidence, becau&s;e my mamma commanded me not to mention it:&mdash;That, expre&s;&s;ing her apprehen&s;ion of the con&s;e|quences of the indignities offered to Mr. Lovelace, &s;he told me, She would leave it to my prudence, to pre|vent, all I could, the impending mi&s;chief on <HI>one</HI> &s;ide.</P>
<P>I am obliged to break off. But, I believe, I have written enough to an&s;wer very fully all that you have commanded from me. It is not for a child to &s;eek to clear her own character, or to ju&s;tify her actions, at the expence of the mo&s;t revered ones: Yet, as I know, that the account of all tho&s;e further proceed|ings, by which I may be affected, will be intere&s;ting to &s;o dear a friend (who will communicate to others no more than what is fitting), I will continue to write as I have opportunity, as minutely as we are u&s;ed to write to each other. Indeed I have no delight, as I have often told you, equal to that which I take in conver&s;ing with you:&mdash;By <HI>letter,</HI> when I cannot in <HI>per&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>Mean time, I can't help &s;aying, that I am ex|ceedingly concerned to find, that I am become &s;o much the public talk, as <HI>you</HI> tell me, and as <HI>every-body</HI> tells me, I am. Your kind, your <HI>precautionary</HI> regard for my fame, and the opportunity you have given me to tell my own &s;tory, previous to any new accident, which heaven avert! is &s;o like the warm friend I have

<P>AS the particular e&s;tate I have mentioned and de|&s;cribed above is principally of my own rai&s;ing: As my three &s;ons have been uncommonly pro&s;perous; and are very rich: The elde&s;t by means of the unex|pected benefits he reaps from his new-found mines: The &s;econd, by what has, as unexpectedly, fallen in to him, on the deaths of &s;everal relations of his pre&s;ent wife, the worthy daughter by both &s;ides of very honour|able families; over and above the very large portion which he received with her in marriage: My &s;on An|tony, by his Ea&s;t-India traffick, and &s;ucce&s;sful voy|ages: As furthermore my grand&s;on James will be &s;ufficiently provided for by his godmother Lovell's kindne&s;s to him; who, having no near relations, a&s;&s;ures me, that &s;he has, as well by deed of gift, as by will, left him both her Scoti&s;h and Engli&s;h e&s;tates: For never (ble&s;&s;ed be God therefore!) was there a family more pro&s;perous in all its branches: And as my &s;econd &s;on James will very probably make it up to my grand|&s;on, and al&s;o to my grand-daughter Arabella; to whom I intend no di&s;re&s;pect; nor have rea&s;on; for &s;he is a very hopeful and dutiful child: And as my &s;ons John and Antony &s;eem not inclined to a marry'd life; &s;o that my &s;on James is the only one who has children, or is likely to have any:&mdash;For all the&s;e rea&s;ons; and becau&s;e my deare&s;t and beloved grand-daughter Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe has been from infancy a matchle&s;s young creature in her duty to me, and ad|mired
<PB N="29" REF="40">
by all who knew her, as a very extraordinary child; I mu&s;t therefore take the plea&s;ure of con&s;ider|ing her, as my own peculiar child; and this, without intending offence; and I hope it will not be taken as any, &s;ince my &s;on James can be&s;tow his favours ac|cordingly, and in greater proportion, upon Mi&s;s Ara|bella, and Ma&s;ter James:&mdash;The&s;e, I &s;ay, are the rea|&s;ons which move me to di&s;po&s;e of the above-de&s;cribed e&s;tate in the precious child's favour; who is the delight of my old age; and, I verily think, has contributed, by her amiable duty, and kind and tender regards, to prolong my life.</P>
<P>Wherefore it is my expre&s;s will and command|ment, and I injoin my three &s;ons John, James, and Antony, and my grand&s;on James, and my grand-daughter Arabella, as they value my ble&s;&s;ing, and my memory, and would wi&s;h their own la&s;t wills and de|&s;ires to be fulfilled by <HI>their</HI> &s;urvivors, that they will not impugn or conte&s;t the following beque&s;ts and di&s;|po&s;itions in favour of my &s;aid grand-daughter Clari&s;&s;a, altho' they &s;hould not be &s;trictly conformable to law, or the forms thereof; nor &s;uffer them to be contro|verted or di&s;puted on any pretence what&s;oever.</P>

<P>I HAVE been hinder'd from pro&s;ecuting my in|tention. Neither nights nor mornings have been my own. My mamma has been very ill; and would have no other nur&s;e but me. I have not &s;tirr'd from her bed&s;ide; for &s;he kept her bed; and two nights I had the honour of &s;haring it with her.</P>
<P>Her di&s;order was a very violent colic. The con|tentions of the&s;e fierce, the&s;e ma&s;culine &s;pirits, and the apprehen&s;ion of mi&s;chiefs that may ari&s;e from the
<PB N="30" REF="41">
increa&s;ing animo&s;ity which all <HI>here</HI> have again&s;t Mr. Lovelace, and his too-well known re&s;entful and intre|pid character, &s;he cannot bear. Then the foundations laid, as &s;he dreads, for jealou&s;y and heart-burnings in her own family, late &s;o happy and &s;o united, afflict exceedingly a gentle and &s;en&s;ible mind, which has from the beginning, on all occa&s;ions, &s;acrifice its own inward &s;atisfaction to outward peace. My bro|ther and &s;i&s;ter, who u&s;ed very often to jar, are now &s;o much one, and are &s;o much together (<HI>caballing</HI> was the word that dropped from her, as if at unawares), that &s;he is full of fears of con&s;equences that may fol|low;&mdash;to my prejudice, perhaps, is her kind concern; &s;ince &s;he &s;ees that they behave to me every hour with more and more &s;hyne&s;s and re&s;erve: Yet, would &s;he but exert that authority, which the &s;uperiority of her fine talents gives her, all the&s;e family-feuds might perhaps be cru&s;h'd in their but-yet beginnings; e&s;pe|cially as &s;he may be a&s;&s;ured, that all fitting conce&s;&s;ions &s;hall be made by me, not only as they are my elders, but for the &s;ake of &s;o excellent and &s;o indulgent a mother.</P>
<P>For, if I may &s;ay to you, my dear, what I would not to any other per&s;on living, it is my opinion, that, had &s;he been of a temper that would have borne le&s;s, &s;he would have had ten times le&s;s to bear than &s;he has had. No commendation, you'll &s;ay, of the gene|ro&s;ity of tho&s;e &s;pirits, which can turn to its own di&s;|quiet &s;o much conde&s;cending goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>Upon my word, I am &s;ometimes tempted to think, that we may make the world allow for and re&s;pect us as we plea&s;e, if we can but be &s;turdy in our wills, and &s;et out accordingly. It is but being the <HI>le&s;s</HI> beloved for it, that's all. And, if we have power to oblige tho&s;e we have to do with, it will not appear to <HI>us,</HI> that we are. Our flatterers will tell us any thing &s;ooner than our faults.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="42">Were there not truth in this ob&s;ervation, is it po&s;|&s;ible, that my brother and &s;i&s;ter could make their very failings, their vehemences, of &s;uch importance to all the family?

are references always previous to every re&s;olution taken by his &s;upe|riors, who&s;e will ought to be his. Well may he ex|pect to be treated with this deference by every other per&s;on, when my papa him&s;elf, generally &s;o ab&s;olute, con&s;tantly pays it to him; and the more &s;ince his god|mother's bounty has given independence to a &s;pirit that was before under too little re&s;traint.&mdash;But whi|ther may the&s;e reflections lead me?&mdash;I know you do not love any of us, but my mamma and me; and, being above all di&s;gui&s;es, make me &s;en&s;ible that you do <HI>not,</HI> oftener than I wi&s;h you did.&mdash;Ought I then to add force to your di&s;likes of tho&s;e whom I wi&s;h you more to like?&mdash;my father, e&s;pecially; for he, poor gentleman! has &s;ome excu&s;e for his impatience of con|tradiction. He is not naturally an ill-temper'd man; and in his per&s;on and air, and in his conver&s;ation too, when not under the torture of a gouty paroxy&s;m, every-body di&s;tingui&s;hes the gentleman born and edu|cated.</P>
<P>Our &s;ex, perhaps, mu&s;t expect to bear a little <HI>un|courtline&s;s,</HI> &s;hall I call it?&mdash;from the <HI>husband,</HI> whom, as the <HI>lover,</HI> they let know the preference their hearts gave him to all other men.&mdash;Say what they will of genero&s;ity being a <HI>manly</HI> virtue; but, upon my word, my dear, I have ever yet ob&s;erved, that it is not to be met with in that &s;ex one time in ten, that it is to be found in ours.&mdash;But my father was &s;our'd by the cruel di&s;temper I have named; which &s;eized him all at once in the very prime of life, in &s;o violent a manner, as to take from the mo&s;t active of minds, as <HI>his</HI> was, all power of activity, and that, in all appearance, for life;&mdash;It impri&s;on'd, as I may &s;ay, his lively &s;pirits in

him&s;elf, and turned the edge of them again&s;t his own peace; his extraordinary pro&s;perity adding but to his impatiency: For tho&s;e, I believe, who want the fewe&s;t earthly ble&s;&s;ings, mo&s;t regret that they want any.</P>
<P>But my brother! what excu&s;e can be made for his haughty and moro&s;e temper? He is really, my dear, I am &s;orry to have occa&s;ion to &s;ay it, an ill-temper'd young man; and treats my mamma &s;ometimes&mdash;In|deed he is not dutiful.&mdash;But, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing every-thing, he has the vice of age, mingled with the ambition of youth, and enjoys nothing&mdash;but his own haughtine&s;s and ill-temper, I was going to &s;ay.&mdash;Yet again am I adding force to your di&s;likes of &s;ome of us.&mdash;Once, my dear, it was, perhaps, in your power to have moulded him as you plea&s;ed.&mdash;Could you have been my &s;i&s;ter!&mdash;Then had I had a friend in a &s;i&s;ter.&mdash;But no wonder that he don't love you now; who could nip in the bud, and that with a di&s;dain, let me &s;ay, too much of kin to his haughtine&s;s, a pa&s;&s;ion, that would not have wanted a fervor worthy of the object; and which po&s;&s;ibly would have <HI>made</HI> him &s;o.&mdash;</P>
<P>But no more of this. I will pro&s;ecute my former intention in my next; which I will &s;it down to as &s;oon as breakfa&s;t is over; di&s;patching this by the me&s;&s;enger whom you have &s;o kindly &s;ent to inquire after us, on my &s;ilence. Mean time, I am,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Harlowe-Place, <DATE>Jan. 20.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I WILL now re&s;ume my narrative of proceedings here.&mdash;My brother being in a good way, altho' you may be &s;ure, that his re&s;entments are rather height|en'd
<PB N="33" REF="44">
than abated by the galling di&s;grace he has re|ceived, my friends (my papa and uncles, however, if not my brother and &s;i&s;ter) begin to think, that I have been treated unkindly. My mamma has been &s;o good as to tell me this, &s;ince I &s;ent away my la&s;t.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, I believe they all think that I receive letters from Mr. Lovelace. But Lord M. being in|clin'd rather to &s;upport than to blame his nephew, they &s;eem to be &s;o much afraid of him, that they do not put it to me, whether I do, or not; conniving on the contrary, as it &s;hould &s;eem, at the only method left to allay the vehemence of a &s;pirit, which they have &s;o much provoked: For he &s;till in&s;i&s;ts upon &s;atisfaction from my uncles; and this, po&s;&s;ibly (for he wants not art) as the be&s;t way to be introduced again, with &s;ome advantage, into our family. And indeed my aunt Hervey has put it to my mamma, whether it were not be&s;t to prevail upon my brother to take a turn to his York&s;hire e&s;tate, which he was intending to do be|fore; and to tarry there till all is blown over.</P>
<P>But this is very far from being his intention: For he has already begun to hint again, that he &s;hall ne|ver be ea&s;y or &s;atisfy'd, till I am marry'd; and, find|ing neither Mr. Symmes nor Mr. Mullins will be ac|cepted, has propo&s;ed Mr. Wyerley once more, on the &s;core of his great pa&s;&s;ion for me. This I have again rejected; and but ye&s;terday he mention'd one who has apply'd to him by letter, making high offers. This is Mr. Solmes; <HI>rich</HI> Solmes, you know they call him. But this has not met with the attention of one &s;ingle &s;oul.</P>
<P>If none of his &s;chemes of marrying me take effect, he has thoughts, I am told, of propo&s;ing to me to go to Scotland, in order, as the compliment is, to put his hou&s;e there in &s;uch order as our own is in. But this my mamma intends to oppo&s;e for her own &s;ake; becau&s;e, having relieved her, as &s;he is plea&s;ed to &s;ay, of the hou&s;hold cares (for which, my &s;i&s;ter, you
<PB N="34" REF="45">
know, has no turn), they mu&s;t again devolve upon her, if I go. And if <HI>&s;he</HI> did not oppo&s;e it, <HI>I</HI> &s;hould; for, believe me, I have no mind to be his hou&s;e|keeper; and, I am &s;ure, were I to go with him, I &s;hould be treated rather as a &s;ervant than a &s;i&s;ter:&mdash;Perhaps, not the better becau&s;e I <HI>am</HI> his &s;i&s;ter. And, if Mr. Lovelace &s;hould follow me, things might be wor&s;e than they are now.</P>
<P>But I have be&s;ought my mamma, who is appre|hen&s;ive of Mr. Lovelace's vi&s;its, and for fear of whom my uncles never &s;tir out without arms and armed &s;ervants, (my brother al&s;o being near well enough to go abroad again), to procure me permi&s;&s;ion to be your gue&s;t for a fortnight, or &s;o.&mdash;Will your mamma, think you, my dear, give me leave?</P>
<P>I dare not a&s;k to go to my dairy-hou&s;e, as my good grandfather would call it: For I am now afraid of being thought to have a wi&s;h to enjoy that inde|pendence to which his will has intitled me: And, as matters are &s;ituated, &s;uch a wi&s;h would be imputed to my favour to the man whom they have now &s;o great an antipathy to. And, indeed, could I be as ea&s;y and happy here, as I u&s;ed to be, I would defy that man, and all his &s;ex; and never repent, that I have given the power of my fortune into my papa's hands.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t now, my mamma has rejoiced me, with the news, that my reque&s;ted permi&s;&s;ion is granted. Every|one thinks it be&s;t, that I &s;hould go to you, except my brother. But he was told, that he mu&s;t not expect to rule in every thing. I am to be &s;ent for into the great parlour, where are my two uncles and my aunt Hervey, and to be acquainted with this conce&s;&s;ion in form.</P>
<P>You know, my dear, that there is a good deal of &s;olemnity among us. But never was there a family more united, in its different branches, than ours.
<PB N="35" REF="46">
Our uncles con&s;ider us as their own children; and declare, that it is for our &s;akes they live &s;ingle. So that they are advi&s;ed with upon every article relating to, or that may affect, us. It is therefore the le&s;s wonder, at a time when they under&s;tand, that Mr. Lovelace is determin'd to pay us an <HI>amicable</HI> vi&s;it, as he calls it (but which I am &s;ure cannot end &s;o) that they &s;hould both be con&s;ulted upon the permi&s;&s;ion I had de&s;ired to attend you.</P>
<P>I will acquaint you with what pa&s;&s;ed at the general leave given me to be your gue&s;t. And yet I know, that you will not love my brother the better for my communication. But I am angry with him my&s;elf, and cannot help it. And, be&s;ides, it is proper to let you know the terms I go upon, and their motives for permitting me to go.</P>
<P>Clary, &s;aid my mamma, as &s;oon as I enter'd the great parlour, your reque&s;t, to go to Mi&s;s Howe's for a few days, has been taken into con&s;ideration, and granted&mdash;</P>
<P>Much again&s;t my liking, I a&s;&s;ure you, &s;aid my brother, rudely interrupting her.</P>
<P>Son James! &s;aid my father, and knit his brows.</P>
<P>He was not daunted. His arm is in a &s;ling. He often has the mean art to look upon <HI>that,</HI> when any thing is hinted, that may be &s;uppo&s;ed to lead towards the lea&s;t favour to, or reconciliation with, Mr. Love|lace.&mdash;Let the <HI>girl</HI> then (I am often <HI>the girl</HI> with him!) be prohibited &s;eeing that vile libertine.</P>
<P>No-body &s;poke.</P>
<P>Do you hear, &s;i&s;ter Clary? taking their &s;ilence for approbation of what <HI>he</HI> had dictated; you are not to receive vi&s;its from Lord M's nephew.</P>
<P>Every-one &s;till remained &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Do you &s;o under&s;tand the licence you have, Mi&s;s? interrogated he.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="47">I would be glad, Sir, &s;aid I, to under&s;tand that you are my <HI>brother</HI>;&mdash;and that <HI>you</HI> would under&s;tand, that you are <HI>only</HI> my brother.</P>
<P>O the fond, fond heart! with a &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eer of in&s;ult, lift|ing up his hands.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid I to my papa, to your ju&s;tice I appeal: If I have de&s;erved reflection, let me not be &s;par'd. But if I am to be an&s;werable for the ra&s;hne&s;s&mdash;</P>
<P>No more!&mdash;No more, of either &s;ide, &s;aid my papa. You are not to receive the vi&s;its of that Lovelace, tho':&mdash;Nor are you, &s;on James, to reflect upon your &s;i&s;ter: She is a worthy child.</P>
<P>Sir, I have done, reply'd he;&mdash;and yet I have <HI>her</HI> honour at heart, as much as the honour of the re&s;t of the family.</P>
<P>And <HI>hence,</HI> Sir, retorted I, your unbrotherly re|flections upon me!</P>
<P>Well, but, you ob&s;erve, Mi&s;s, &s;aid he, that it is not <HI>I,</HI> but your <HI>papa,</HI> that tells you, that you are not to receive the vi&s;its of that Lovelace.</P>
<P>Cou&s;in Harlowe, &s;aid my aunt Hervey, allow me to &s;ay, That my cou&s;in Clary's prudence may be con|fided in.</P>
<P>I am <HI>convinc'd</HI> it may, join'd my mamma.</P>
<P>But, Aunt, but, Madam (put in my &s;i&s;ter) there is no hurt, I pre&s;ume, in letting my &s;i&s;ter know the condition &s;he goes to Mi&s;s Howe upon; &s;ince, if he gets a knack of vi&s;iting her there&mdash;</P>
<P>You may be &s;ure, interrupted my uncle Harlowe, he will endeavour to &s;ee her there.</P>
<P>So would &s;uch an impudent man <HI>here,</HI> &s;aid my uncle Antony: And 'tis better <HI>there</HI> than <HI>here.</HI></P>
<P>Better <HI>no-where,</HI> &s;aid my papa.&mdash;I command you, turning to me, on pain of my di&s;plea&s;ure, that you &s;ee him not at all.</P>
<P>I will not, Sir, in any way of encouragement, I do a&s;&s;ure you; Nor at all, if I can decently avoid it.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="48">You know with what indifference, &s;aid my mam|ma, &s;he has hitherto &s;een him.&mdash;Her prudence may be tru&s;ted to, as my &s;i&s;ter Hervey &s;ays.</P>
<P>With what ap-<HI>pa</HI>-rent indifference, drolled my bro|ther&mdash;</P>
<P>Son James! &s;aid my father, &s;ternly&mdash;</P>
<P>I have done, Sir, &s;aid he.&mdash;But again, in a pro|voking manner, reminded me of the prohibition.</P>
<P>Thus ended this conference.</P>
<P>Will you engage, my dear, that the hated man &s;hall not come near your hou&s;e?&mdash;But what an incon|&s;i&s;tence is this, when they con&s;ent to my going, think|ing his vi&s;its <HI>here</HI> no otherwi&s;e to be avoided!&mdash;But, if he does come, I charge you, never leave us alone together.</P>
<P>As I have no rea&s;on to doubt a welcome from your mamma, I will put every-thing in order here, and be with you in two or three days.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Harlowe-Place, <DATE>Feb. 20.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I BEG your excu&s;e for not writing &s;ooner. Alas, my dear, I have &s;ad pro&s;pects before me! My brother and &s;i&s;ter have &s;ucceeded in all their views. They have found out another lover for me; an hi|deous one:&mdash;Yet he is encouraged by every-body.&mdash;No wonder that I was order'd home &s;o &s;uddenly!&mdash;At an hour's warning!&mdash;No other notice, you know, than what was brought with the chariot that was to carry me back.&mdash;It was for fear, as I have been in|form'd (an unworthy fear!), that I &s;hould have en|ter'd
<PB N="38" REF="49">
into any concert with Mr. Lovelace, had I known their motive for commanding me home; ap|prehending, 'tis evident, that I &s;hould di&s;like the man.</P>
<P>And well might they apprehend &s;o:&mdash;For who do you think he is?&mdash;No other than that <HI>Solmes!</HI>&mdash;Could you have believed it?&mdash;And they are all deter|mined too; my mamma with the re&s;t!&mdash;Dear, dear excellence! how could &s;he be thus brought over!&mdash;when I am a&s;&s;ured, that, on his fir&s;t being propo&s;ed, &s;he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, That, had Mr. Solmes the <HI>In|dies</HI> in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and would endow me with them, &s;he &s;hould not think him de&s;erving of her Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe.</P>
<P>The reception I met with at my return, &s;o differ|ent from what I u&s;ed to meet with on every little ab|&s;ence (and now I had been from them three weeks), convinced me, that I was to &s;uffer for the happine&s;s I had had in your company and conver&s;ation for that mo&s;t agreeable period. I will give you an account of it.</P>
<P>My brother met me at the door, and gave me his hand, when I &s;tepp'd out of the chariot. He bow'd very low: Pray, Mi&s;s, favour me.&mdash;I thought it in good humour; but found it afterwards mock re&s;pect: And &s;o he led me, in great form, I prattling all the way, inquiring of every-body's health (altho' I was &s;o &s;oon to &s;ee them, and there was hardly time for an&s;wers), into the great parlour; where were my fa|ther, mother, my two uncles, and my &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>I was &s;truck all of a heap as &s;oon as I enter'd, to &s;ee a &s;olemnity which I had been &s;o little u&s;ed to on the like occa&s;ions, in the countenance of every dear re|lation. They all kept their &s;eats. I ran to my papa, and kneeled: Then to my mamma: And met from both a cold &s;alute: From my papa, a ble&s;&s;ing but half|pronounced: My mamma, indeed, called me, Child; but embraced me not with her u&s;ual indulgent ardor.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="50">After I had paid my duty to my uncles, and my compliments to my &s;i&s;ter, which &s;he received with &s;olemn and &s;tiff form, I was bid to &s;it down. But my heart was full: And I &s;aid it became me to &s;tand, if I <HI>could</HI> &s;tand a reception &s;o awful and unu&s;ual. I was forced to turn my face from them, and pull out my handkerchief.</P>
<P>My unbrotherly accu&s;er hereupon &s;tood forth, and charg'd me with having received no le&s;s than <HI>five or &s;ix vi&s;its</HI> at Mi&s;s Howe's from the man they had all &s;o much rea&s;on to hate (that was the expre&s;&s;ion); notwith&s;tanding the commands I had received to the contrary. And he bid me deny it, if I could.</P>
<P>I had never been u&s;ed, I &s;aid, to deny the truth; nor would I now. I owned I had, in the pa&s;&s;ed three weeks, &s;een the per&s;on I pre&s;umed he meant <HI>oftener</HI> than five or &s;ix times (Pray hear me out, brother, &s;aid I; for he was going to flame).&mdash;But he always came and a&s;ked for Mrs. or Mi&s;s Howe.</P>
<P>I proceeded, That I had rea&s;on to believe, that both Mrs. Howe and Mi&s;s, as matters &s;tood, would much rather have excu&s;ed his vi&s;its; but they had more than once apologiz'd, that, having not the &s;ame rea&s;on my papa had, to forbid him their hou&s;e, his rank and fortune intitled him to civility.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, my dear, I made not the pleas I might have made.</P>
<P>My brother &s;eem'd ready to give a loo&s;e to his pa&s;|&s;ion: My papa put on the countenance, which always portends a gathering &s;torm: My uncles mutteringly whi&s;per'd: And my &s;i&s;ter aggravatingly held up her hands. While I begg'd to be heard out;&mdash;and my mamma &s;aid, Let the <HI>child,</HI> that was her kind word, be heard.&mdash;</P>
<P>I hoped, I &s;aid, there was no harm done: That it became not me to pre&s;cribe to Mrs. or Mi&s;s Howe who &s;hould be their vi&s;itors: That Mrs. Howe was always diverted with the raillery that pa&s;&s;ed between
<PB N="40" REF="51">
Mi&s;s and him: That I had no rea&s;on to challenge <HI>her</HI> gue&s;t for <HI>my</HI> vi&s;itor; as I &s;hould &s;eem to have done, had I refu&s;ed to go into their company, when he was with them: That I had never &s;een him out of the pre&s;ence of one or both of tho&s;e ladies; and had &s;ignify'd to him, once, on his urging for a few moments private conver&s;ation with me, that, unle&s;s a reconciliation were effected between my family and his, he mu&s;t not expect, that I would countenance his vi&s;its; much le&s;s give him an opportunity of that &s;ort.</P>
<P>I told them further, That Mi&s;s Howe &s;o well un|der&s;tood my mind, that &s;he never left me a moment, while he was there: That, when he came, if I was not below in the parlour, I would not &s;uffer my&s;elf to be called to him: Altho' I thought it would be an affectation, which would give him advantage rather than the contrary, if I had left company when he came in; or refu&s;ed to enter into it, when I found he would &s;tay any time.</P>
<P>My brother heard me out with &s;uch a kind of im|patience, as &s;hew'd he was re&s;olved to be di&s;&s;atisfy'd with me, &s;ay what I would, The re&s;t, as the event has proved, behav'd as if they <HI>would</HI> have been &s;ati&s;|fy'd, had they not further points to carry, by intimi|dating me. All this made it evident, as I mention'd above, that they them&s;elves expected not my volun|tary compliance; and was a tacit confe&s;&s;ion of the di&s;|agreeablene&s;s of the per&s;on they had to propo&s;e.</P>
<P>I was no &s;ooner &s;ilent, than my <HI>brother</HI> &s;wore, al|tho' in my papa's pre&s;ence (&s;wore, uncheck'd either by eye or countenance), That, for his part, he would <HI>never</HI> be reconciled to that libertine: And that he would renounce me for a &s;i&s;ter, if I encouraged the addre&s;&s;es of a man &s;o obnoxious to them all.</P>
<P>A man who had like to have been my brother's murderer, my <HI>&s;i&s;ter</HI> &s;aid, with a face even bur&s;ting with re&s;traint of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="52">The poor Bella has, you know, a plump, high-fed face, if I may be allow'd the expre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;You, I know, will forgive me for this liberty of &s;peech, &s;ooner than I can my&s;elf: Yet, how can one be &s;uch a reptile, as not to turn when trampled upon!&mdash;</P>
<P>My <HI>papa,</HI> with vehemence both of action and voice (my father has, you know, a terrible voice, when he is angry!), told me, that I had met with too much indulgence, in being allow'd to refu&s;e <HI>this</HI> gentleman, and the <HI>other</HI> gentleman; and it was now <HI>his</HI> turn to be obey'd.</P>
<P>Very true, my <HI>mamma</HI> &s;aid:&mdash;And hoped his will would not now be di&s;puted by a child &s;o favour'd.</P>
<P>To &s;hew they were all of a &s;entiment, my uncle <HI>Harlowe</HI> &s;aid, He hoped his beloved niece only wanted to know her papa's will, to obey it.</P>
<P>And my uncle <HI>Antony,</HI> in his rougher manner, That I would not give them rea&s;on to apprehend, that I thought my grandfather's favour to me had made me independent of them all.&mdash;If I did, he could tell me, the will could be &s;et a&s;ide, and <HI>&s;hould.</HI></P>

<P>I did not know, I &s;aid, that I had given occa&s;ion for this har&s;hne&s;s: I hoped I &s;hould always have a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of their favour to me, &s;uperadded to the duty I ow'd as a daughter and a niece: But that I was &s;o much &s;urpri&s;ed at a reception &s;o unu&s;ual and unex|pected, that I hoped my papa and mamma would give me leave to retire, in order to recollect my&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="53">No one gain&s;aying, I made my &s;ilent compliments, and withdrew;&mdash;leaving my brother and &s;i&s;ter, as I thought, plea&s;ed; and as if they wanted to congratu|late each other on having occa&s;ioned &s;o &s;evere a begin|ning to be made with me.</P>

<P>As we &s;at, my mamma, in her admirable manner, expatiated upon brotherly and &s;i&s;terly love; indul|gently blam'd my brother and &s;i&s;ter upon having taken up di&s;plea&s;ure too lightly again&s;t me; and politically, if I may &s;o &s;ay, an&s;wer'd for my obedience to my papa's will.&mdash;<HI>Then it would be all well,</HI> my papa was pleas'd to &s;ay: <HI>Then they &s;hould dote upon me,</HI> was my brother's expre&s;&s;ion: <HI>Love me as well as ever,</HI> was my &s;i&s;ter's: And my uncles, <HI>That I &s;hould then be the pride of their hearts.</HI>&mdash;But, alas! what a forfeiture of all the&s;e mu&s;t I make!</P>

<P>THEY drive on here at a furious rate. The man lives here, I think. He courts them, and is more and more a favourite. Such terms, &s;uch &s;et|tlements! That's the cry!</P>
<P>O, my dear, that I had not rea&s;on to deplore the family fault, immen&s;ely rich as they all are! But this I may the more unre&s;ervedly &s;ay to you, as we have often join'd in the &s;ame concern: I, for a father and uncles; you, for a mother; in every other re&s;pect faultle&s;s.</P>
<P>Hitherto, I &s;eem to be delivered over to my bro|ther, who pretends as great love to me as ever.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="55">You may believe, I have been very &s;incere with him. But he affects to railly me, and not to believe it po&s;&s;ible, that one, &s;o dutiful and &s;o di&s;creet as his &s;i&s;ter Clary, can re&s;olve to di&s;oblige all her friends.</P>
<P>Indeed, I tremble at the pro&s;pect before me; for it is evident, that they are &s;trangely determin'd.</P>
<P>My father and mother indu&s;triou&s;ly avoid giving me opportunity of &s;peaking to them alone. They a&s;k not for my approbation, intending, as it &s;hould &s;eem, to <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> me into their will. And with them I &s;hall hope to prevail, or with no-body. They have not the <HI>intere&s;t</HI> in compelling me, as my brother and &s;i&s;ter have: I &s;ay le&s;s therefore to them, re&s;erving my whole force for an audience with my father, if he will per|mit me a patient ear. How difficult is it, my dear, to give a negative, where both duty and inclination join to make one wi&s;h to oblige!&mdash;</P>
<P>I have already &s;tood the &s;hock of three of this man's particular vi&s;its, be&s;ides my &s;hare in his more general ones; and find it is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould ever endure him. He has but a very ordinary &s;hare of under|&s;tanding; is very illiterate; knows nothing but the value of e&s;tates, and how to improve them; and what belongs to land-jobbing, and hu&s;bandry. Yet am I as one &s;tupid, I think. They have begun &s;o cruelly with me, that I have not &s;pirit enough to a&s;&s;ert my own negative.</P>
<P>My good Mrs. Norton they had endeavour'd, it &s;eems, to influence, before I came home: So intent are they to carry their point: And her opinion not being to their liking, &s;he has been told, that &s;he would do well to decline vi&s;iting here for the pre&s;ent: Yet &s;he is the per&s;on of all the world, next to my mam|ma, the mo&s;t likely to prevail upon me, were the mea&s;ures they are engag'd in, rea&s;onable mea&s;ures; or &s;uch as &s;he could think &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="56">My aunt likewi&s;e having &s;aid, that &s;he did not think her niece could ever be brought to like Mr. Solmes, has been obliged to learn another le&s;&s;on.</P>
<P>I am to have a vi&s;it from her to-morrow. And, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ince I have refu&s;ed &s;o much as to hear from my bro|ther and &s;i&s;ter what the noble &s;ettlements are to be, &s;he is to acquaint me with the particulars; and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eceive from me my determination: For my father, I am told, will not have patience but to <HI>&s;uppo&s;e,</HI> that I &s;hall &s;tand in oppo&s;ition to his will.</P>
<P>Mean time it has been &s;ignify'd to me, that it will be acceptable, if I do not think of going to church next Sunday.</P>
<P>The &s;ame &s;ignification was made me for la&s;t Sun|day; and I obey'd. They are apprehen&s;ive, that Mr. Lovelace will be there, with de&s;ign to come home with me.</P>
<P>Help me, dear Mi&s;s Howe, to a little of your charming &s;pirit: I never more wanted it.</P>
<P>The man, you may &s;uppo&s;e, has no rea&s;on to boa&s;t of his progre&s;s with me. He has not the &s;en&s;e to &s;ay any thing to the purpo&s;e. His court&s;hip, indeed, is to <HI>them</HI>; and my brother pretends to court me as his proxy, truly! I utterly to my brother refu&s;e his appli|cation; but thinking a per&s;on &s;o well received, and recommended, by all my family, intitled to good man|ners, all I &s;ay again&s;t him is affectedly attributed to coyne&s;s: And he, not being &s;en&s;ible of his own im|perfections, believes that my avoiding him when I can, and the re&s;erves I expre&s;s, are owing to nothing el&s;e:&mdash;For, as I &s;aid, all his court&s;hip is to <HI>them</HI>; and I have no opportunity of &s;aying No, to one who a&s;ks me not the que&s;tion. And &s;o, with an air of <HI>manni&s;h</HI> &s;uperiority, he &s;eems rather to pity the ba&s;hful girl, than apprehend that he &s;hall not &s;ucceed.</P>

<P>I have had the expected conference with my aunt.</P>
<P>I have been obliged to hear the man's propo&s;al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from her; and all their motives for e&s;pou&s;ing him a they do. I am even loth to mention, how equally unju&s;t it is for him to make &s;uch offers, or for tho&s;e I am bound to reverence to accept of them. I hate him more than before. One great e&s;tate is already obtained at the expence of the relations to it, tho' di&s;tant relations; my brother's, I mean, by his god mother: And this has given the hope, however chi|merical that hope, of procuring others; and that my own, at lea&s;t, may revert to the family: And yet in my opinion, the world is but one great family originally it was &s;o: What then is this narrow &s;elfi&s;h+ne&s;s that reigns in us, but relation&s;hip remembre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> again&s;t relation&s;hip forgot?</P>

<P>My brother, upon my aunt's report (made, how+ever, as I am informed, in the gentle&s;t manner, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> even giving remote hopes, which &s;he had no com|mi&s;&s;ion from me to give), brought me, in authoritative terms, the prohibition.</P>

<P>No, not to Mi&s;s Howe, <HI>Madam,</HI> tauntingly: For have you not acknowleg'd, that Lovelace is a fa|vourite there?</P>

<P>And do you think, brother, this is the way?&mdash;</P>
<P>Do <HI>you</HI> look to that:&mdash;But your letters will be &s;topt, I can tell you.&mdash;And away he flung.</P>

<P>I was &s;ent for down to tea. I went with a very chearful a&s;pect: But had occa&s;ion &s;oon to change it.</P>
<P>Such a &s;olemnity in every-body's countenance!&mdash;My mamma's eyes were fixed upon the tea-cups; and when &s;he looked up, it was heavily, as if her eye|lids had weights upon them; and then not to me. My papa &s;at half-a&s;ide in his elbow-chair, that his

My brother looked at me with &s;corn, having mea&s;ured me, as I may &s;ay, with his eyes, as I enter'd, from head to foot. My aunt was there, and looked upon me, as if with kindne&s;s re&s;trained, bending coldly to my com|pliment to her, as &s;he &s;at; and then ca&s;t an eye fir&s;t on my brother, then on my &s;i&s;ter, as if to give the rea|&s;on (&s;o I am willing to con&s;true it) of her unu&s;ual &s;tiffne&s;s.&mdash;Ble&s;s me, my dear! that they &s;hould choo&s;e to intimidate rather than invite a mind, till now, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> thought either unper&s;uadable or ungenerous!&mdash;</P>

<P>He looked &s;o very &s;ternly, that my heart failed me as twice or thrice I would have addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to him: Nothing but &s;olemn &s;ilence on all hands having pa&s;&s;ed before.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, I a&s;ked, If it were his plea&s;ure, that I &s;hould pour him out another di&s;h?</P>
<P>He an&s;wer'd me with the &s;ame angry mono&s;yllable which I had received from my mamma before; and then aro&s;e, and walked about the room. I aro&s;e too, with intent to throw my&s;elf at his feet; but was too

<P>Hope nothing.&mdash;Tell me not of <HI>hopes,</HI> but of <HI>facts.</HI> I ask nothing of you but what is in your power to comply with, and what it is your duty to comply with.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Feb. 26. in the morning.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY aunt, who &s;taid here la&s;t night, made me vi&s;it this morning, as &s;oon as it was light. She tells me, that I was left alone with my papa ye&s;terday on purpo&s;e that he might talk with me on my expecte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> obedience; but that he own'd he was put be&s;ide his pur|po&s;e by reflecting on &s;omething my brother had tol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> him in my disfavour, and by his impatience but to &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;uch a gentle &s;pirit as mine had hitherto &s;eem'd to be, &s;hould pre&s;ume to di&s;pute his will, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oint where the advantage of the whole family was to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;o greatly promoted by my compliance.</P>
<P>I find, by a few words which dropt from her un+awares, that they have all an ab&s;olute dependence upon what they &s;uppo&s;e to be a meekne&s;s in my temper But in this they may be mi&s;taken; for I verily think upon a &s;trict examination of my&s;elf, that I have al|mo&s;t
<PB N="51" REF="62">
as much in me of my father's as of my mother's family.</P>
<P>My uncle Harlowe, it &s;eems, is again&s;t driving me upon extremities: But his unbrotherly nephew has engaged, that the regard I have for my reputation, and my principles, will bring me <HI>round to my duty,</HI> that's the expre&s;&s;ion. Perhaps I &s;hall have rea&s;on to wi&s;h I had not known this.</P>
<P>My aunt advi&s;es me to &s;ubmit, for the pre&s;ent, to the interdicts they have laid me under; and, indeed, to encourage Mr. Solmes's addre&s;s. I have ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed the latter, let what will, as I have told her, be the con&s;equence. The vi&s;iting prohibition I will conform to. But as to that of not corre&s;ponding with you, nothing but the menace, that our letters &s;hall be intercepted, can engage my ob&s;ervation of it.</P>
<P>She believes, that this order is from my father, without con&s;ulting my mother upon it: And that purely, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;es, in con&s;ideration to me, left I &s;hould mortally offend him; and this from the in|citements of <HI>other</HI> people (meaning you and Mi&s;s Lloyd, I make no doubt), rather than by my own will. For &s;till, as &s;he tells me, he &s;peaks kind and prai&s;eful things of me.</P>
<P>Here is clemency! Here is indulgence!&mdash;And &s;o it is, To prevent a head&s;trong child, as a good prince would wi&s;h to do di&s;affected &s;ubjects, from running into rebellion, and &s;o forfeiting every-thing! But this is all my brother's young man's wi&s;dom; a blotter without a head, and a brother without a heart!</P>
<P>How happy might I have been with any other bro|ther in the world, but Mr. James Harlowe; and with any other &s;i&s;ter, but <HI>his</HI> &s;i&s;ter! Wonder not, my dear! that I, who u&s;ed to chide you for the&s;e &s;ort of liberties with my relations, now am more un|dutiful than you ever were unkind. I cannot bear the thought of being deprived of the principal plea&s;ure of
<PB N="52" REF="63">
my life; for &s;uch is your conver&s;ation by per&s;on and by letter. And who be&s;ides can bear to be made the dupe of &s;uch low cunning, operating with &s;uch high and arrogant pa&s;&s;ions?</P>
<P>But can you, my dear Mi&s;s Howe, conde&s;cend to carry on a private corre&s;pondence with me? If you can, there is one way I have thought of, by which it may be done.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t remember the Green Lane, as we call it, that runs by the &s;ide of the wood-hou&s;e and poultry-yard, where I keep my bantams, phea&s;ants, and pea-hens, which generally engage my notice twice a-day; the more my favourites, becau&s;e they were my grand|father's, and recommended to my care by him; and therefore brought hither from my dairy-hou&s;e, &s;ince his death.</P>
<P>The lane is lower than the floor of the wood-hou&s;e; and in the &s;ide of the wood-hou&s;e the boards are rotted away down to the floor, for half an ell together, in &s;everal places. Hannah can &s;tep into the lane, and make a mark with chalk where a letter or parcel may be pu&s;h'd in, under &s;ome &s;ticks; which may be &s;o managed, as to be an un&s;u&s;pected cover for the written depo&s;ites from either.</P>
<P>I HAVE been ju&s;t now to look at the place, and find it will an&s;wer. So your faithful Robert may, without coming near the hou&s;e, and as only pa&s;&s;ing thro' the green lane, which leads to two or three farm-hou&s;es (out of livery, if you plea&s;e), very ea&s;ily take from thence my letters, and depo&s;ite yours.</P>
<P>This place is the more convenient, becau&s;e it is &s;el|dom re&s;orted to, but by my&s;elf or Hannah, on the above-mentioned account; for it is the general &s;tore-hou&s;e for firing; the wood for con&s;tant u&s;e being nearer the hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="64">One corner of this being &s;eparated off for the roo&s;t|ing-place of my little poultry, either &s;he or I &s;hall never want a pretence to go thither.</P>
<P>Try, my dear, the &s;ucce&s;s of a letter this way; and give me your opinion and advice what to do, in this di&s;graceful &s;ituation, as I cannot but call it; and what you think of my pro&s;pects; and what you would do in my ca&s;e.</P>
<P>But, before-hand, I mu&s;t tell you, that your ad|vice mu&s;t not run in favour of this Solmes: And yet it is very likely they will endeavour to engage your mamma, in order to induce you, who have &s;uch an influence over me, to favour him.</P>
<P>Yet, on &s;econd thoughts, if you incline to that &s;ide of the que&s;tion, I would have you write your whole mind. Determin'd, as I think I am, and can|not help it, I would at lea&s;t give a patient hearing to what may be &s;aid on the other &s;ide. For my regards are not &s;o much engag'd (upon my word, they are not; I know not my&s;elf if they be) to another per|&s;on, as &s;ome of my friends &s;uppo&s;e; and as you, give|ing way to your lively vein, upon his la&s;t vi&s;its, af|fected to &s;uppo&s;e. What pre&s;erable favour I may have for him to any other per&s;on, is owing more to the u&s;age he has received, and for my &s;ake borne, than to any per&s;onal con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>I write a few lines of grateful acknowlegement to your mamma for her favours to me in the late happy period. I fear I &s;hall never know &s;uch another!&mdash;I hope &s;he will forgive me, that I did not write &s;ooner.</P>
<P>The bearer, if &s;u&s;pected and examin'd, is to pro|duce <HI>that,</HI> as the only one he carries. How do need|le&s;s watchfulne&s;s and undue re&s;traint produce artifice and contrivance! I &s;hould abhor the&s;e clande&s;tine corre&s;pondencies, were they not forced upon me. They have &s;o mean, &s;o low an appearance, to my&s;elf, that I think I ought not to expect, that you &s;hould take part in them.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="65">But why (as I have al&s;o expo&s;tulated with my aunt) mu&s;t I be pu&s;hed into a &s;tate, which, altho' I reverence, I have no wi&s;h to enter into?&mdash;Why &s;hould not my brother, &s;o many years older, and &s;o earne&s;t to &s;ee me engaged, be fir&s;t engaged?&mdash;And, if not &s;o, why not my &s;i&s;ter be fir&s;t provided for?</P>
<P>But here I conclude the&s;e unavailing expo&s;tulations, with the a&s;&s;urance, that I am, and ever will be,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Febr. 27.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT odd heads &s;ome people have!&mdash;Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe to be &s;acrificed in marriage to Mr. Roger Solmes! A&s;toni&s;hing!</P>
<P><HI>I mu&s;t not,</HI> you &s;ay, <HI>give my advice in favour of this man!</HI>&mdash;You now half-convince me, my dear, that you are ally'd to the family that could think of &s;o prepo&s;terous a match, or you could never have had the lea&s;t notion of my advi&s;ing in his favour.</P>
<P>Ask me for his picture: You know I have a good hand at drawing an ugly likene&s;s. But I'll &s;ee a little farther fir&s;t: For who knows what may happen; &s;ince matters are in &s;uch a train; and &s;ince you have not the <HI>courage</HI> to oppo&s;e &s;o overwhelming a torrent.</P>
<P>You ask me to help you to a little of my &s;pirit. Are you in earne&s;t? But it will not now, I doubt, do you &s;ervice.&mdash;It will not fit naturally upon you. You are your mamma's girl, think what you will, and have violent &s;pirits to contend with. Alas! my dear, you &s;hould have borrowed &s;ome of mine a little &s;ooner;&mdash;that is to &s;ay, before you had given the management of your e&s;tate into the hands of tho&s;e who think they have a prior claim to it. What, tho'
<PB N="55" REF="66">
a <HI>father</HI>'s?&mdash;Has not that father two elder children?&mdash;And do they not both bear his &s;tamp and image, more than you do?&mdash;Pray, my dear, call me not to account for this free que&s;tion; le&s;t your <HI>application</HI> of my meaning prove to be as &s;evere as <HI>that.</HI></P>
<P>Now I have launch'd out a little, indulge me one word more in the &s;ame &s;train: I will be decent, I pro|mi&s;e you.&mdash;I think you might have known, that AVARICE and ENVY are two pa&s;&s;ions that are not to be &s;atisfy'd, the one by <HI>giving,</HI> the other by the en|vied per&s;on's continuing to <HI>de&s;erve</HI> and <HI>excel.</HI>&mdash;Fuel, fuel both, all the world over, to flames in&s;atiate and devouring.</P>
<P>But &s;ince you ask for <HI>my</HI> opinion, you mu&s;t tell me all you know or &s;urmi&s;e of <HI>their</HI> inducements. And if you will not forbid me to make extracts from your letters, for the entertainment of my cou&s;in in the little i&s;land, who longs to hear more of your affairs, it will be very obliging.</P>
<P>But you are &s;o tender of &s;ome people, who have no tenderne&s;s for any body but them&s;elves, that I mu&s;t conjure you to &s;peak out. Remember, that a friend|&s;hip like ours admits of no re&s;erves. You may tru&s;t my impartiality: It would be an affront to your own judgment, if you did not: For do you not <HI>a&s;k</HI> my advice? And have you not taught me, that friend|&s;hip &s;hould never give a bias again&s;t ju&s;tice?&mdash;Ju&s;tify them therefore, if you can. Let us &s;ee if there be any <HI>&s;en&s;e,</HI> whether &s;ufficient <HI>rea&s;on</HI> or not, in their choice. At pre&s;ent, I cannot (and yet I know a good deal of your family) have any conception, how <HI>all</HI> of them, your mamma in particular, and your aunt Hervey, can join with the re&s;t again&s;t judgments given. As to &s;ome of the others, I cannot wonder at any thing they do, or attempt to do, where Self is concern'd.</P>
<P>You ask, Why may not your brother be fir&s;t en|gag'd in wedlock?&mdash;I'll tell you why: His temper and his arrogance are too well known to induce women he
<PB N="56" REF="67">
would a&s;pire to, to receive his addre&s;&s;es, notwith|&s;tanding his great independent acqui&s;itions, and &s;till greater pro&s;pects. Let me tell you, my dear, tho&s;e acqui&s;itions have given him more pride, than reputa|tion. To me he is the mo&s;t intolerable creature that I ever &s;aw. The treatment you blame, he merited from one whom he would have addre&s;&s;ed with the air of a per&s;on intending to confer, rather than hoping to receive a favour. I ever loved to mortify proud and in&s;olent &s;pirits. What, think you, makes me bear Hickman near me, but that the man is humble, and knows his di&s;tance?</P>
<P>As to your que&s;tion, Why your elder &s;i&s;ter may not be fir&s;t provided for? I an&s;wer, Becau&s;e &s;he mu&s;t have no man, but who has a great and clear e&s;tate; that's one thing. Another is, Becau&s;e &s;he has a younger &s;i&s;ter:&mdash;Pray, my dear, be &s;o good as to tell me, what man of a great and clear e&s;tate would think of that elder &s;i&s;ter, while the younger were &s;ingle?</P>
<P>You are all too rich to be happy, child. For mu&s;t not each of you, by the con&s;titutions of your family, marry to be <HI>&s;till</HI> richer? People who know in what their <HI>main</HI> excellence con&s;i&s;ts are not to be blam'd (are they?) for cultivating and improving what they think mo&s;t valuable? Is true happine&s;s any part of your family-view?&mdash;So far from it, that none of your family, but your&s;elf, could be happy were they not rich. So let them fret on, grumble and grudge, and accumulate; and wondering what ails them that they have not hap|pine&s;s when they have riches, think the cau&s;e is want of more; and &s;o go on heaping up, till death, as greedy an accumulator as them&s;elves, gathers them into his garner!</P>
<P>Well then once more, I &s;ay, do you, my dear, tell <HI>me</HI> what you know of their avowed and general mo|tives; and I will tell <HI>you</HI> more than you will tell <HI>me</HI> of their failings! Your aunt Hervey, you &s;ay, <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See p. <HI>46.</HI></NOTE> has told <HI>you:</HI>&mdash;Why, as I hinted above, mu&s;t I ask you to let
<PB N="57" REF="68">
me know them; when you conde&s;cend to ask my ad|vice on the occa&s;ion?</P>
<P>That they prohibit your corre&s;ponding with <HI>me,</HI> is a wi&s;dom I neither wonder at, nor blame them for: Since it is an evidence to me, that they know their own folly: And if they do, is it &s;trange that they &s;hould be afraid to tru&s;t another's judgment upon it?</P>
<P>I am glad you have found out a way to corre&s;pond with me. I approve it much. I &s;hall <HI>more,</HI> if this fir&s;t tryal of it proves &s;ucce&s;sful. But &s;hould it not, and &s;hould it fall into their hands, it would not con|cern me, but for your &s;ake.</P>
<P>We had heard before you wrote, that all was not right between your relations and you, at your coming home: That Mr. Solmes vi&s;ited you, and that with a pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. But I concluded, the mi&s;take lay in the per|&s;on; and that his addre&s;s was to Mi&s;s Arabella: And in|deed had &s;he been as good-natur'd as your plump ones generally are, I &s;hould have thought her too good for him by half:&mdash;Thought I, this <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be the thing; and my beloved friend is &s;ent for to advi&s;e and a&s;&s;i&s;t in her nuptial preparations. Who knows, &s;aid I to my mam|ma, but that, when the man has thrown a&s;ide his yel|low, full-buckled peruke, and his broad-brimm'd bea|ver, both of which I &s;uppo&s;e were Sir Oliver's Be&s;t of long &s;tanding, he may cut a tolerable figure dangling to church with Mi&s;s Bell!&mdash;The woman, as &s;he ob|&s;erves, <HI>&s;hould</HI> excel the man in features: And where can &s;he match &s;o well for a foil?</P>
<P>I indulged this &s;urmize again&s;t rumour, becau&s;e I could not believe, that the ab&s;urde&s;t people in Eng|land could be &s;o <HI>very</HI> ab&s;urd, as to think of this man for you.</P>
<P>We heard moreover, that you received no vi&s;itors: I could a&s;&s;ign no rea&s;on for this; except that the pre|parations for your &s;i&s;ter were to be private, and the ceremony &s;udden: Mi&s;s Lloyd and Mi&s;s Biddulph were with me to inquire what I knew of this; and of
<PB N="58" REF="69">
your not being at church, either morning or afternoon, the Sunday after your return from us; to the di&s;ap|pointment of a little hundred of your admirers, to u&s;e their words. It was ea&s;y for me to gue&s;s the rea&s;on to be what you confirm:&mdash;Their apprehen&s;ions that Lovelace would be there, and attempt to wait on you home.</P>
<P>My mamma takes very kindly your compliments in your letter to her. Her words upon reading it were;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe is an admirable young lady; Where-ever &s;he goes, &s;he confers a favour: Whom|ever &s;he leaves, &s;he fills with regret.'</Q>
&mdash;And then a little comparative reflection;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'O my Nancy, that you had a little of her &s;weet obligingne&s;s!'</Q></P>
<P>No matter. The prai&s;e was yours. You are me; and I enjoy'd it. The more enjoy'd it, becau&s;e&mdash;&s;hall I tell you the truth?&mdash;Becau&s;e I think my&s;elf as well as I am&mdash;Were it but for this rea&s;on; That had I twenty brother James's, and twenty &s;i&s;ter Bell's, not one of them, nor all of them join'd together, would dare to treat me, as yours pre&s;ume to treat you. The per&s;on who will bear much &s;hall have much to bear, all the world <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hro': 'Tis your own &s;entiment, grounded upon the &s;tronge&s;t in&s;tance that can be given in your own family; tho' you have &s;o little improv'd by it.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult is this, That I am fitter for <HI>this</HI> world than you: You for the <HI>next</HI> than me;&mdash;that's the dif|ference.&mdash;But long, long, for my &s;ake, and for hun|dreds of &s;akes, may it be, before you quit us for com|pany more congenial, and more worthy of you!&mdash;</P>
<P>I communicated to my mamma the account you give of your &s;trange reception; al&s;o what a horrid wretch they have found out for you; and the com|pul&s;ory treatment they give you. It only &s;et her on magnifying her lenity to me, on my <HI>tyrannical</HI> beha|viour, as &s;he <HI>will</HI> call it (mothers mu&s;t have their way, you know), to the man &s;he &s;o warmly recommends, again&s;t whom, it &s;eems, there can be no ju&s;t exception;
<PB N="59" REF="70">
and expatiating upon the complai&s;ance I owe her for her indulgence. So I believe I mu&s;t communicate to her nothing farther,&mdash;e&s;pecially as I know &s;he would condemn the corre&s;pondence between us, and That between you and Lovelace, as a clande&s;tine and undu|tiful thing: For <HI>duty implicit</HI> is her cry. And more|over &s;he lends a pretty open ear to the preachments of that &s;tarch old bachelor your uncle Antony; and for an example to <HI>her</HI> daughter, would be more careful how &s;he takes your part, be the cau&s;e ever &s;o ju&s;t. Yet is not this right policy neither. For people who will allow nothing, will be granted nothing: In other words, tho&s;e who aim at carrying too many points will not be able to carry any.</P>
<P>But can you divine, my dear, what that old preach|ment-making plump-hearted &s;oul, your uncle Antony, means, by his frequent amblings hither?&mdash;There is &s;uch &s;mirking and &s;miling between my mamma and him! Such mutual prai&s;es of oeconomy; and
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'<HI>That</HI> is my way!'</Q>
&mdash;and 
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'<HI>This</HI> I do!'</Q>
&mdash;and
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I am glad it has <HI>your</HI> approbation, Sir!'</Q>
&mdash;and
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'<HI>You</HI> look into every thing, Madam!'</Q>
&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Nothing would be done, if I <HI>did not!</HI>'</Q>
&mdash;Such exclamations again&s;t &s;ervants: Such exaltings of &s;elf!&mdash;And <HI>dear-heart,</HI> and <HI>good-lack!</HI>&mdash;and '<HI>las-a-day!</HI>&mdash;And now and then their con|ver&s;ation &s;inking into a whi&s;pering accent, if <HI>I</HI> come cro&s;s them!&mdash;I'll tell you, my dear, I don't above half like it.</P>
<P>Only that the&s;e old bachelors u&s;ually take as many years to re&s;olve upon matrimony, as they can rea|&s;onably expect to live; or I &s;hould be ready to fire upon his vi&s;its; and recommend Mr. Hickman, as a much properer man, to my mamma's acceptance: For what he wants in years, he makes up in gravity: And if you will not chide me, I will &s;ay, That there is a primne&s;s in <HI>both,</HI> e&s;pecially when the man has pre&s;umed too much with me upon my mamma's favour for him, and is under di&s;cipline on that account, as
<PB N="60" REF="71">
makes them &s;eem near of kin: And then in contem|plation of my &s;aucine&s;s, and what they both bear from it, they &s;igh away!&mdash;and &s;eem &s;o mightily to com|pa&s;&s;ionate each other, that if Pity be but one remove from Love, I am in no danger, while they both are in a great deal, and don't know it.</P>
<P>Now, my dear, I know you will be upon me with your grave airs: <HI>So in for the lamb,</HI> as the &s;aying is, <HI>in for the &s;heep</HI>; and do you your&s;elf look about you: For I'll have a pull with you, by way of being afore|hand. Hannibal, we read, always advi&s;ed to attack the Romans upon their own territories.</P>
<P>You are plea&s;ed to &s;ay, and <HI>upon your word too!</HI>&mdash;That your <HI>regards</HI> (a mighty quaint word for <HI>affec|tions) are not &s;o much engag'd, as &s;ome of your friends &s;uppo&s;e, to another per&s;on.</HI> What need you give one to imagine, my dear, that the la&s;t month or two has been a period extremely favourable to that <HI>other</HI> per|&s;on!&mdash;whom it has made an obliger of the niece for his patience with the uncles.</P>
<P>But, to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s that by,&mdash;<HI>So much</HI> engag'd!&mdash;<HI>How much,</HI> my dear? Shall I infer? <HI>Some of your friends</HI> &s;uppo&s;e <HI>a great deal.</HI>&mdash;You &s;eem to own <HI>a little.</HI></P>
<P>Don't be angry. It is all fair: Becau&s;e you have not acknowleg'd to me That <HI>little.</HI> People, I have heard you &s;ay, who affect &s;ecrets always excite cu|rio&s;ity.</P>
<P>But you proceed with a kind of drawback upon your averrment, as if recollection had given you a doubt.&mdash;<HI>You know not your&s;elf, if they be</HI> [&s;o much engag'd]. Was it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay This, to me?&mdash;and to &s;ay it <HI>upon your word</HI> too?&mdash;But you know be&s;t.&mdash;Yet you don't neither, I believe. For a be|ginning Love is acted by a &s;ubtile &s;pirit; and often|times di&s;covers it&s;elf to a by&s;tander, when the per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;s'd (why &s;hould I not call it <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;s'd?)</HI> knows not it has &s;uch a demon.</P>
<P>But further you &s;ay, What PREFERABLE <HI>favour
<PB N="61" REF="72">
you may have for him, to any other per&s;on, is owing more to the u&s;age he has received, and for your &s;ake borne, than to any per&s;onal con&s;ideration.</HI></P>
<P>This is generou&s;ly &s;aid. It is in character.. But, O my friend, depend upon it, you are in danger. Depend upon it,. whether you know it or not, you are a little in for't.

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Wedne&s;day, March 1.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU both nettled and alarmed me, my deare&s;t Mi&s;s Howe, by the concluding part of your la&s;t. At fir&s;t reading it, I did not think it nece&s;&s;ary, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, to guard again&s;t a critic, when I was write|ing to &s;o dear a friend. But then recollecting my&s;elf, Is there not more in it, &s;aid I, than the re&s;ult of a vein &s;o naturally lively? Surely, I mu&s;t have been guilty of an inadvertence.&mdash;Let me enter into the clo&s;e examination of my&s;elf, which my beloved friend advi&s;es.</P>
<P>I did &s;o; and cannot own any of the <HI>glow,</HI> any of the <HI>throbs</HI> you mention.&mdash;<HI>Upon my word,</HI> I will re|peat, I cannot. And yet the pa&s;&s;ages in my letter upon which you are &s;o humourou&s;ly &s;evere, lay me fairly open to your agreeable rail<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ery. I own they do. And I cannot tell what turn my mind had taken, to dictate &s;o oddly to my pen.</P>
<P>But-pray-now&mdash;Is it &s;aying &s;o much, when one, who has no very particular regard to <HI>any</HI> man, &s;ays, There are <HI>&s;ome</HI> who are preferable to <HI>others?</HI> And is it blameable to &s;ay, <HI>Tho&s;e</HI> are the preferable, who are not well u&s;ed by one's relations; yet di&s;pen&s;e with that u&s;age out of regard to one's &s;elf, which they would otherwi&s;e re&s;ent? Mr. Lovelace, for in&s;tance, I may be allow'd to &s;ay, is a man to be preferr'd to Mr. Solmes; and that I <HI>do</HI> prefer him to that man: But, &s;urely, this may be &s;aid, without its being a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, that one mu&s;t be in love with him.</P>
<P>Indeed, I would not be <HI>in love</HI> with him, as it is called, for the world: Fir&s;t, becau&s;e I have no opi|nion of his morals; and think it a fault in which our whole family, my brother excepted, has had a &s;hare,
<PB N="64" REF="75">
that he was permitted to vi&s;it us with a hope; which, however being di&s;tant, did not, as I have ob&s;erved heretofore, intitle any of us to call him to account for &s;uch of his immoralities as came to our ears. Next, becau&s;e I think him to be a vain man, capable of tri|umphing, &s;ecretly at lea&s;t, over a per&s;on who&s;e heart he thinks he has engaged. And, thirdly, becau&s;e the a&s;&s;iduities and veneration which you impute to him, &s;eem to carry an haughtine&s;s in them, as if his addre&s;s had a merit in it, that would be an equivalent for a lady's favour. In &s;hort, he &s;eems to me &s;o to behave, when mo&s;t unguarded, as if he thought him&s;elf above the very politene&s;s which his birth and education (per|haps therefore more than his choice) oblige him to &s;hew. In other words, his very politene&s;s appears to me to be con&s;trained; and, with the mo&s;t remarkably ea&s;y and genteel <HI>per&s;on,</HI> &s;omething &s;eems to be behind in his <HI>manner,</HI> that is too &s;tudiou&s;ly kept in. Then, good-humour'd as he is thought to be in the main to <HI>other peoples</HI> &s;ervants, and this even to familiarity (altho', as you have ob&s;erv'd, a familiarity that has dignity in it, not unbecoming a man of quality), he is apt &s;ometimes to break out into pa&s;&s;ion with <HI>his own:</HI> An oath or a cur&s;e follows; and &s;uch looks from tho&s;e &s;ervants as plainly &s;hew terror; and that they &s;hould have far'd wor&s;e, had they not been in my hearing: With a con|firmation in the ma&s;ter's looks of a &s;urmize too well ju&s;tify'd.</P>
<P>Indeed, my dear, THIS man is not THE man. I have great objections to him. My heart <HI>throbs</HI> not after him: I <HI>glow</HI> not, but with indignation again&s;t my&s;elf, for having given room for &s;uch an imputation.&mdash;But you mu&s;t not, my deare&s;t friend, con&s;true common Gratitude into Love. I cannot bear that you &s;hould. But if ever I &s;hould have the misfortune to think it Love, I promi&s;e you, <HI>upon my word,</HI> which is the &s;ame as <HI>upon my honour,</HI> that I will acquaint you with it.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="76">You bid me to tell you very &s;peedily, and by the new-found expedient, that I am not di&s;plea&s;ed with you for your agreeable raillery: I di&s;patch this there|fore immediately; po&s;tponing to my next the account of the inducements which my friends have to promote with &s;o much earne&s;tne&s;s the addre&s;s of Mr. Solmes.</P>
<P>Be &s;atisfy'd, my dear, mean time, that I am <HI>not</HI> di&s;plea&s;ed with you: Indeed I am not: On the con|trary, I give you my hearty thanks for your friendly premonitions. And I charge you, as I have often done, that if you ob&s;erve any thing in me &s;o very faulty, as would require, from you to others, in my behalf, the palliation of friendly and partial love, you acquaint me with it: For, methinks, I would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o conduct my&s;elf, as not to give rea&s;on even for an <HI>adver&s;ary</HI> to cen&s;ure me: And how &s;hall &s;o weak and &s;o young a creature avoid the cen&s;ure of &s;uch, if my <HI>friend</HI> will not hold a looking-gla&s;s before me, to let me &s;ee my imperfections?</P>
<P>Judge me then, my dear, as any indifferent per&s;on knowing what <HI>you</HI> know of me) would do:&mdash;I may, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t fir&s;t, be a little pained; may <HI>glow</HI> a little, perhaps, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o be found le&s;s worthy of your friend&s;hip, than I wi&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o be; but a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf, that your kind correction will give me reflection, that &s;hall <HI>amend</HI> me. If it do not, you will have a fault to accu&s;e me of, that will be utterly <HI>in</HI>-excu&s;able: A fault, let me add, that &s;hould you <HI>not</HI> accu&s;e me of it, if in your opi|nion I am guilty, you will not be &s;o much, &s;o <HI>warmly,</HI> my friend, as I am yours; who have never &s;par'd you, you know, my dear, on the like occa&s;ions.</P>

<P>But whether you have a value for this Lovelace, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not, I know you'll be impatient to hear what Mr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="67" REF="78">
Forte&s;cue has &s;aid of him. Nor will I keep you longer in &s;u&s;pen&s;e.</P>
<P>An hundred wild &s;tories &s;he tells of him, from child|hood to manhood: for, as &s;he ob&s;erves, having never been &s;ubject to contradiction, he was always as mi&s;|chievous as a monkey. But I &s;hall pa&s;s over the&s;e whole hundred of his puerile rogueries, altho' <HI>indica|tive</HI> ones, as I may &s;ay, to take notice as well of &s;ome things you are not quite ignorant of, as of others you know not; and to make a few ob&s;ervations upon him and his ways.</P>
<P>Mrs. Forte&s;cue owns, what every-body knows, that he is notoriou&s;ly, nay, avowedly, a man of plea|&s;ure; yet &s;ays, that in any thing he &s;ets his heart upon, or undertakes, he is the mo&s;t indu&s;trious and per&s;e|vering mortal under the &s;un. He re&s;ts, it &s;eems, not above &s;ix hours in the twenty-four, any more than you. He delights in writing. Whether at his Uncle's, or at Lady Betty's, or Lady Sarah's, he has always, when he retires, a pen in his fingers. One of his com|panions, confirming his love of writing, has told her, that his thoughts flow rapidly to his pen: And you and I, my dear, have ob&s;erved, on more occa&s;ions than one, that tho' he writes even a fine hand, he is one of the readie&s;t and quicke&s;t of writers. He mu&s;t indeed have had early a very docile genius; &s;ince a per&s;on of his plea&s;urable turn, and active &s;pirit, could never have &s;ubmitted to take long or great pains in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ttaining the qualifications he is ma&s;ter of; qualifi|cations &s;o &s;eldom attainable by youth of quality and fortune; by &s;uch e&s;pecially of tho&s;e of either, who, like him, have never known what it was to be con|trouled.</P>
<P>He had once the vanity, upon being complimented <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the&s;e talents (and on his &s;urpri&s;ing diligence for a man of plea&s;ure) to compare him&s;elf to Julius Cae|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ar; who perform'd great actions by day, and wrote them down at night: And valued him&s;elf, that he
<PB N="68" REF="79">
only wanted Cae&s;ar's out&s;etting, to make a figure among his cotemporaries.</P>
<P>He &s;poke this, indeed, &s;he &s;ays, with an air o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> plea&s;antry: For &s;he ob&s;erved, and &s;o have we, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he has the art of acknowleging his vanity, with &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> much humour, that it &s;ets him above the contemp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which is due to vanity and &s;elf-opinion; and at the &s;ame time half-per&s;uades tho&s;e who he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r him, that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> really de&s;erves the exaltation he gives him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing it to be true, that all his vacan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> nightly hours are imploy'd in writing, what can be hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ubjects? If, like Cae&s;ar, his own actions, he mu&s;t u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> doubtedly be a very enterpri&s;ing and very wicked man &s;ince no-body &s;u&s;pects him to have a &s;erious turn And, decent as he is in his conver&s;ation with us, hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> writings are not probably &s;uch as will redound eithe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to his own honour, or to the benefit of others, we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they to be read.

<P>That you and I, my dear, &s;hould love to write, no wonder. We have always, from the time eac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> could hold a pen, delighted in epi&s;tolary corre&s;pond+encies. Our employments are dome&s;tic and &s;ede<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+tary; and we can &s;cribble upon twenty innocent &s;ub+jects, and take delight in them becau&s;e they <HI>are</HI> inno+cent; tho' were they to be &s;een, they might n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> much profit or plea&s;e others. But that &s;uch a ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> lively young fellow as this, who rides, hunts, tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+vels, frequents the public entertainments, and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>means</HI> to pur&s;ue his plea&s;ures, &s;hould be able to &s;et him+&s;elf down to write for hours together, as you and have heard him &s;ay he frequently does, that is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;trange thing.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="80">Mrs. Forte&s;cue &s;ays, that he is a complete ma&s;ter of &s;hort-hand writing. By the way, what induce|ments could &s;uch a &s;wift writer as he have, to learn &s;hort-hand?</P>
<P>She &s;ays (and we know it as well as &s;he) that he has a &s;urpri&s;ing memory; and a very lively imagination.</P>
<P>Whatever his other vices are, all the world, as well as Mrs. Forte&s;cue, &s;ay, he is a &s;ober man. And among all his bad qualities, <HI>gaming,</HI> that great wa&s;ter of time, as well as fortune, is not his vice: So that he mu&s;t have his head as cool, and his rea&s;on as clear, as the prime of youth, and his natural gaiety, will permit; and, by his early morning hours, a great portion of time upon his hands, to employ in writing, or wor&s;e.</P>
<P>Mrs. Forte&s;cue &s;ays, he has one gentleman, who is more his intimate and corre&s;pondent than any of the re&s;t. You remember what his di&s;mi&s;s'd bailiff &s;aid of him, and of his a&s;&s;ociates. I don't find, but that man's character of him was in general pretty ju&s;t. Mrs. Forte&s;cue confirms this part of it, that all his relations are afraid of him; and that his pride &s;ets him above owing obligations to them. She believes he is clear of the world; and that he will continue &s;o: No doubt from the &s;ame motive that makes him avoid being oblig'd to his relations.</P>
<P>A per&s;on willing to think favourably of him would hope, that a <HI>brave,</HI> a <HI>learned,</HI> and a <HI>diligent</HI> man, cannot be <HI>naturally</HI> a <HI>bad</HI> man.&mdash;But if he be better than his enemies &s;ay he is (and, if wor&s;e, he is bad in|deed), he is guilty of an inexcu&s;able fault, in being &s;o carele&s;s as he is of his reputation. I think a man can be &s;o but from one of the&s;e two rea&s;ons: Either that he is con&s;cious he de&s;erves the evil &s;poken of him; or, that he takes a pride in being thought wor&s;e than he is:&mdash;Both very bad and threatening indications: Since the fir&s;t mu&s;t &s;hew him to be utterly abandon'd; and it is but natural to conclude from the other, that what a man is not a&s;ham'd to have imputed to him, he will
<PB N="70" REF="81">
not &s;cruple to be guilty of, whenever he has oppor|tunity.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, and upon all that I could gather from Mrs. Forte&s;cue, Mr. Lovelace is a very faulty man: You and I have thought him too gay, too in|con&s;iderate, too ra&s;h, too little an hypocrite, to be <HI>deep.</HI> You &s;ee he never would di&s;gui&s;e his natural temper (haughty as it certainly is), with re&s;pect to your brother's behaviour to him: Where he thinks a contempt due, he pays it to the uttermo&s;t: Nor has he complai&s;ance enough to &s;pare your uncles.</P>
<P>But were he deep, and ever &s;o deep, you would &s;oon penetrate him, if they would leave you to your|&s;elf. His vanity would be your clue. Never man had more: Yet, as Mrs. Forte&s;cue ob&s;erved, never did man carry it off &s;o happily. There is a &s;trange mixture in it of humourous vivacity:&mdash;For but one half of what he &s;ays of him&s;elf, when he is in the vein, any other man would be in&s;ufferable.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>TALK <HI>of the devil,</HI> is an old &s;aying.&mdash;The lively wretch has made me a vi&s;it, and is but ju&s;t gone away. He is all impatience and re&s;entment, at the treatment you meet with; and full of apprehen&s;ions too, that they will carry their point with you.</P>
<P>I told him my opinion, that you will never be brought to think of &s;uch a man as Solmes; but that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> will probably end in a compo&s;ition, never to have either.</P>
<P>No man, he &s;aid, who&s;e fortunes and alliances are &s;o con&s;iderable, ever had &s;o little favour from a lady, for who&s;e &s;ake he had borne &s;o much.</P>
<P>I told him my mind, as freely as I u&s;ed to do. But who ever was in fault, Self being judge? He com|plain'd of &s;pies &s;et upon his conduct, and to pry into his life and morals; and this by your brother and uncles.</P>

<P>I NOW take up my pen, to lay before you the inducements and motives which my friends have to e&s;pou&s;e &s;o earne&s;tly the addre&s;s of this Mr. Solmes.</P>
<P>In order to &s;et this matter in a clear light, it is nece&s;&s;ary to go a little backward, and even perhaps to mention &s;ome things which you already know: And &s;o you may look upon what I am going to relate,
<PB N="72" REF="83">
as a kind of &s;upplement to my letters of the 15th and 20th of January la&s;t.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e letters, of which I have kept memoran|dums, I gave you an account of my brother's and &s;i&s;ter's implacablene&s;s to Mr. Lovelace; and the methods they took (&s;o far as they had then come to my know|lege) to ruin him in the opinion of my other friends: And I told you, that after a very cold, yet not a di|rectly affrontive behaviour, to him, they all of a <HI>&s;ud|den</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Letter <HI>iv.</HI> p. <HI>21.</HI></NOTE> became more violent, and proceeded to per|&s;onal in&s;ults; which brought on, at la&s;t, the unhappy rencounter between my brother and him.</P>
<P>Now you mu&s;t know, that from the la&s;t con|ver&s;ation which pa&s;&s;ed between my aunt and me, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> comes out, that this <HI>&s;udden</HI> vehemence on my bro|ther's and &s;i&s;ter's parts, was owing to &s;tronger rea&s;ons than to the college-begun antipathy on his &s;ide, or t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;lighted love on hers; to wit, to an apprehen&s;io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that my uncles intended to follow my grandfather'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> example, in my favour; at lea&s;t, in a higher degree that they wi&s;h they &s;hould: An apprehen&s;ion founded, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;eems, on a conver&s;ation between my two uncles, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> my brother and &s;i&s;ter; which my aunt communicated to me in confidence, as an argument to prevail upon me to accept of Mr. Solmes's <HI>noble</HI> &s;ettlements; urging that &s;uch a &s;ea&s;onable compliance would fru&s;trate my brother's and &s;i&s;ter's views, and e&s;tabli&s;h me for eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the opinion and love of my father and uncles.</P>
<P>I will give you the &s;ub&s;tance of this communicate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> conver&s;ation, after I have made a brief introductory ob&s;ervation or two: Which, however, I hardly need to make to you, who are &s;o well acquainted with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> all, did not the &s;eries or thread of the &s;tory require it.</P>
<P>I have more than once mentioned to you the dar|ling view &s;ome of us have long had of <HI>rai&s;ing a family</HI> as it is called: A reflection, as I have often thought upon our own; which is no incon&s;iderable or up&s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="73" REF="84">
one, on either &s;ide: Of my mamma's, e&s;pecially.&mdash;A view too frequently, it &s;eems, entertained by fami|lies, which having great &s;ub&s;tance, cannot be &s;ati&s;|fy'd without rank and title.</P>
<P>My uncles had once extended this view to each of us three children; urging, that as they them&s;elves intended not to marry, we each of us might be &s;o portion'd, and &s;o advantageou&s;ly matched, as that our po&s;terity, if not our&s;elves, might make a fir&s;t figure in our country&mdash;While my brother, as the only &s;on, thought the two girls might be very well provided for by ten or fifteen thou&s;and pounds apiece: And that all the real e&s;tates in the family, to wit, my grandfather's, father's, and two uncles, and the remainder of their re&s;pective per&s;onal e&s;tates, together with what he had an expectancy of from his godmother, would make &s;uch a noble fortune, and give him &s;uch an intere&s;t, as might intitle him to hope for a peerage: Nothing le&s;s would &s;atisfy his ambition.</P>
<P>With this view, he gave him&s;elf airs very early;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That his grandfather and uncles were his &s;tewards: That no man ever had better: That daughters were but incumbrances and drawbacks upon a family:'</Q>
And <HI>this</HI> low and familiar expre&s;&s;ion was often in his mouth, and utter'd always with the &s;elf-complai&s;ance which an imagin'd happy thought can be &s;uppo&s;ed to give the &s;peaker; to wit,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That a man who has &s;ons brings up chickens for his own table;'</Q>
(tho' once I made his compari&s;on &s;tagger with him, by a&s;king him, If the &s;ons, to make it hold, were to have their necks wrung off?); 'whereas daughters are chickens brought up for the tables of other men.' This, ac|companied with the equally polite reflection,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That, to induce people to take them off their hands, the family-&s;tock mu&s;t be impaired into the bargain,'</Q>
u&s;ed to put my &s;i&s;ter out of all patience: And altho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he now &s;eems to think a <HI>younger</HI> &s;i&s;ter only can be an incumbrance, &s;he was then often propo&s;ing to me
<PB N="74" REF="85">
to make a party in our own favour again&s;t my bro|ther's <HI>rapacious views,</HI> as &s;he u&s;ed to call them: While I was for con&s;idering the liberties he took of this &s;ort, as the effect of a temporary plea&s;antry; which in a young man not naturally good-humour'd, I was glad to &s;ee; or as a foible, that de&s;erv'd raillery, but no other notice.</P>
<P>But when my grandfather's will (of the purport of which in my particular favour, until it was open'd, I was as ignorant as they) had lopp'd off one branch of my brother's expectation, he was extremely di&s;&s;ati&s;|fy'd with me. No-body indeed was plea&s;ed: For al|tho' every-one loved me, yet being the younge&s;t child, father, uncles, brother, &s;i&s;ter, all thought them&s;elves po&s;tpon'd, as to matter of right and power (Who loves not power?): And my father him&s;elf could not bear that I &s;hould be made &s;ole, as I may call it, and inde|pendent; for &s;uch the will, as to that e&s;tate, and the powers it gave (unaccountably, as they all &s;aid), made me.</P>
<P>To obviate therefore every-one's jealou&s;y, I gave up to my father's management, as you know, not only the e&s;tate, but the money bequeathed me (which was a moiety of what my grandfather had by him at his death; the other moiety being bequeathed to my &s;i&s;ter); contenting my&s;elf to take, as from his bounty, what he was plea&s;ed to allow me, without de&s;iring the lea&s;t addition to my annual &s;tipend. And then I hoped I had laid all envy a&s;leep: But &s;till my brother and &s;i&s;ter (jealous, as now is evident, of my two uncles favour for me, and of the plea&s;ure I had given my father and them, by this act of duty) were every-now-and-then occa&s;ionally doing me covert ill offices: Which I took the le&s;s notice of; having, as I imagin'd, re|moved the cau&s;e of their envy; and imputed every thing of that &s;ort to the petulance they are both pretty much noted for.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="86">My brother's acqui&s;ition then took place: This made us all very happy; and he went down to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it: And his ab&s;ence (on &s;o good an ac|count too) made us &s;till happier.&mdash;Then follow'd Lord M.'s propo&s;al for my &s;i&s;ter: And this was an additional felicity for the time. I have told you how exceedingly good-humour'd it made my &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>You know how that went off: You know what came on in its place.</P>
<P>My brother then return'd; and we were all wrong again: And Bella, as I ob&s;erv'd in my letters above-mention'd, had an opportunity to give her&s;elf the cre|dit of having refu&s;ed Mr. Lovelace, on the &s;core of his reputed faulty morals. This united my brother and &s;i&s;ter in one cau&s;e. They &s;et them&s;elves on all occa|&s;ions to depreciate Mr. Lovelace, and his <HI>family</HI> too, (a family which de&s;erves nothing but re&s;pect): And this gave ri&s;e to the conver&s;ation I am leading to, be|tween my uncles and them: Of which I now come to give the particulars; after I have ob&s;erved, that it hap|pen'd before the rencounter, and &s;oon after the inquiry made into Mr. Lovelace's affairs had come out better than my brother and &s;i&s;ter hoped or expected <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Letter <HI>iv.</HI> p. <HI>22.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>They were bitterly inveighing again&s;t him, in their u&s;ual way, &s;trengthening their invectives with &s;ome new &s;tories in his disfavour; when my uncle Antony, having given them a patient hearing, declar'd,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That he thought the gentleman behav'd like a gentleman; his niece Clary with prudence; and that a more ho|nourable alliance for the family, <HI>as he had often told them,</HI> could not be wi&s;hed for: Since Mr. Lovelace had a very good paternal e&s;tate; and that, by the evidence of an enemy, all clear: Nor did it appear, that he was &s;o bad a man as had been repre&s;ented: Wild indeed; but it was at a gay time of life: He was a man of &s;en&s;e: And he was &s;ure that his niece would not have him, if &s;he had not good rea&s;on to
<PB N="76" REF="87">
think him reform'd, or, by her own example, likely to be &s;o.'</Q></P>
<P>He then gave one in&s;tance, my aunt told me, as a proof of a genero&s;ity in his &s;pirit, which &s;hew'd him, he &s;aid, to be no very bad man in nature; and of a temper, he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, like my own: Which was, that when he, my uncle, had repre&s;ented to him, that he might, if he plea&s;ed (as he had heard Lord M. &s;ay), make three or four hundred pounds a year of his paternal e&s;tate, more than he did; he an&s;wer'd,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That his tenants paid their rents well: That it was a maxim with his family, from which he would by no means depart, never to rack-rent old tenants, or their de&s;cendants; and that it was a plea&s;ure to him, to &s;ee all his tenants look fat, &s;leek, and contented.'</Q></P>
<P>I indeed had once occa&s;ionally heard him &s;ay &s;ome|thing like this; and thought he never looked &s;o well as at the time;&mdash;except once; on this occa&s;ion:</P>
<P>An unhappy tenant came petitioning to my uncle Antony for forbearance, in Mr. Lovelace's pre&s;ence. When he had fruitle&s;ly withdrawn, Mr. Lovelace pleaded his cau&s;e &s;o well, that the man was called in again, and had his &s;uit granted. And Mr. Lovelace privately follow'd him out, and gave him two guineas, for pre&s;ent relief; the man having declared, that, at the time, he had not five &s;hillings in the world.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion, he told my uncle of the good action I hinted at, and that without any o&s;tentatious airs; to wit, That he had once ob&s;erved an old tenant and his wife in a very mean habit at church; and que&s;tioning them about it next day, as he knew they had no hard bargain in their farm, the man &s;aid, he had done &s;ome very fooli&s;h things with a good inten|tion, which had put him behind-hand, and he could not have paid his rent, and appear better. He a&s;ked him, how long it would take him to retrieve the fooli&s;h &s;tep he had made. He &s;aid, perhaps two or three years. Well then, &s;aid he, I will abate you five pounds
<PB N="77" REF="88">
a year for &s;even years, provided you will lay it out upon your wife and &s;elf, that you may make a Sunday appearance <HI>like</HI> MY <HI>tenants.</HI> Mean time take This (putting his hand in his pocket, and giving him five guineas), to put your&s;elves in pre&s;ent plight; and let me &s;ee you next Sunday at church, hand in hand, like an hone&s;t and loving couple; and I be&s;peak you to dine with me afterwards.</P>
<P>Altho' this plea&s;ed me when I heard it, as giving an in&s;tance of genero&s;ity and prudence at the &s;ame time, not le&s;&s;ening, as my uncle took notice, the yearly value of the farm, yet, my dear, I had no <HI>throbs,</HI> no <HI>glows</HI> upon it;&mdash;<HI>upon my word,</HI> I had not. Neverthele&s;s I own to you, that I could not help &s;ay|ing to my&s;elf on the occa&s;ion,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Were it ever to be my lot to have this man, he would not hinder me from pur&s;uing the methods I &s;o much delight to take.'</Q>
&mdash;With
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'A pity, that &s;uch a man were not <HI>uniformly</HI> good!'</Q></P>
<P>Forgive me this digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>My uncle went on, my aunt told me,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That, be|&s;ides his paternal e&s;tate, he was the immediate heir to very &s;plendid fortunes: That, when he was in treaty for his niece Arabella, Lord M. told him, what great things he and his two half-&s;i&s;ters intended to do for him, in order to qualify him for the title (which would be extinct at his Lord&s;hip's death); and which they hoped to procure for him, or a &s;till higher, that of tho&s;e Ladies father, which had been for &s;ome time extinct, on failure of heirs male: That this view made his relations &s;o earne&s;t for his mar|rying: That as he &s;aw not where Mr. Lovelace could better him&s;elf; &s;o, truly, he thought there was wealth enough in their own family to build up three con&s;iderable ones: That therefore, he mu&s;t needs &s;ay, he was the more de&s;irous of this alliance, as there was a great probability, not only from Mr. Lovelace's de&s;cent, but from his fortunes, that his niece
<PB N="78" REF="89">
Clari&s;&s;a might one day be a peere&s;s of Great Britain:&mdash;And upon that pro&s;pect <HI>(here was the mortifying &s;troke)</HI> he &s;hould, for his own part, think it not wrong, to make &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions as &s;hould contri|bute to the better &s;upport of the dignity.'</Q></P>
<P>My uncle Harlowe, it &s;eems, far from di&s;approving of what his brother had &s;aid, declar'd,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That there was but one objection to an alliance with Mr. Love|lace; to wit, his morals: E&s;pecially as &s;o much could be done for Mi&s;s Bella, and for my brother too, by my father; and as my brother was actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a con&s;iderable e&s;tate, by virtue of the deed of gift and will of his godmother Lovell.'</Q></P>
<P>Had I known this before, I &s;hould the le&s;s have wonder'd at many things I have been unable to account for in my brother's and &s;i&s;ter's behaviour to me; and been more on my guard than I imagin'd there was a nece&s;&s;ity to be.</P>
<P>You may ea&s;ily gue&s;s how much this conver&s;ation affected my brother at the time. He could not, you know, but be very unea&s;y, to hear <HI>two of his &s;tewards</HI> talk at this rate to his face.</P>
<P>He had from early days, by his violent temper, made him&s;elf both feared and courted by the whole family. My father him&s;elf, as I have lately men|tioned, very often (long before his acqui&s;itions had made him &s;till more a&s;&s;uming) gave way to him, as to an only &s;on, who was to build up the name, and aug|ment the honour of it. Little inducement therefore had he to correct a temper, which gave him &s;o much con&s;ideration with every-body.</P>
<P>'See, &s;i&s;ter Bella,' &s;aid he, in an indecent pa&s;&s;ion before my uncles, on the occa&s;ion I have mention'd&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'See how it is!&mdash;You and I ought to look about us!&mdash;This little Syren is in a fair way to <HI>out-uncle,</HI> as well as <HI>out-grandfather</HI> us both!'</Q></P>
<P>From this time, as I now find it plain upon recol|lection, did my brother and &s;i&s;ter behave to me, as to
<PB N="79" REF="90">
one who &s;tood in their way (&s;ometimes as to a creature in love with their common enemy); and to each other, as having but one intere&s;t: And were re&s;olved therefore to bend all their force to hinder an alliance from taking effect, which they believed was likely to oblige them to contract their views.</P>
<P>And how was this to be done, after &s;uch a decla|ration from both my uncles?</P>
<P>My brother found out the way. My &s;i&s;ter, as I have &s;aid, went hand in hand with him. Between them, the family union was broken, and every-one was made unea&s;y. Mr. Lovelace was received more and more coldly by all: But not being to be put out of his cour&s;e by &s;lights <HI>only,</HI> per&s;onal affronts &s;uc|ceeded; defiances next; then the rencounter: That, as you have heard, did the bu&s;ine&s;s: And now, if I do not oblige them, my grandfather's e&s;tate is to be litigated with me; and I, who never de&s;igned to take advantage of the independency bequeathed me, <HI>am to be as dependent upon my papa's will, as a daughter ought to be who knows not what is good for her&s;elf.</HI> This is the language of the family now.</P>
<P>But if I will &s;uffer my&s;elf to be prevailed upon, how happy, as <HI>they</HI> lay it out, &s;hall we all be!&mdash;Such pre&s;ents am I to have, &s;uch jewels, and I can|not not tell what, from every one of the family! Then Mr. Solmes's fortunes are &s;o great, and his propo&s;als &s;o very advantageous (no relation whom he values), that there will be abundant room to rai&s;e mine upon them, were the high-intended favours of my own relations to be quite out of the que&s;tion. More|over it is now, with this view, found out, that I have qualifications, which, of <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> will be a full equivalent to him for the &s;ettlements he is to make me; and leave <HI>him,</HI> as well as <HI>them,</HI> under an obli|gation to me for my compliance. He him&s;elf thinks &s;o, I am told; &s;o very poor a creature is he, even in <HI>his own,</HI> as well as in <HI>their</HI> eyes.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="91">The&s;e charming views an&s;wer'd, how rich, how &s;plendid, &s;hall we all three be! And I&mdash;what ob|ligations &s;hall I lay upon them all!&mdash;And that only by doing an act of duty &s;o &s;uitable to my character, and manner of thinking;&mdash;if indeed I am the gene|rous, as well as dutiful creature, I have hitherto made them believe I am.</P>
<P>This is the bright &s;ide that is turn'd to my father and uncles, to captivate them: But I am afraid, that my brother's and &s;i&s;ter's de&s;ign is to ruin me with them at any rate. Were it otherwi&s;e, would they not, on my return from you, have rather &s;ought to court than frighten me into mea&s;ures their hearts are &s;o much bent to carry? A method they have followed ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>Mean time, orders are given to all the &s;ervants to &s;hew the highe&s;t re&s;pect to Mr. Solmes; the <HI>generous</HI> Mr. Solmes is now his character with &s;ome of our family! But are not the&s;e orders a tacit confe&s;&s;ion, that they think his own merit will not procure him re&s;pect? He is accordingly, in every vi&s;it he makes, not only highly-care&s;&s;ed by the principals of our fa|mily, but ob&s;equiou&s;ly attended and cring'd to by the menials.&mdash;And <HI>the noble &s;ettlements</HI> are echoed from every mouth.</P>
<P><HI>Noble</HI> is the word u&s;ed to inforce the offers of a man, who is mean enough avowedly to <HI>hate,</HI> and wicked enough to propo&s;e to <HI>rob</HI> of their ju&s;t expec|tations, his own family (every one of which at the &s;ame time &s;tands in too much need of his favour), in order to &s;ettle all he is worth upon me; and, if I die without children, and he has none by any other marriage, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pon a family which already abounds. Such are his propo&s;als.</P>
<P>But were there no other motive to induce me to de&s;pi&s;e the up&s;tart man, is not this unju&s;t one to his family enough?&mdash;The <HI>up&s;tart man,</HI> I repeat; for he was not born to the immen&s;e riches he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of:
<PB N="81" REF="92">
Riches left by one niggard to another, in injury to the next heir, becau&s;e that other is a niggard. And &s;hould I not be as culpable, do you think, in my ac|ceptance of &s;uch unju&s;t &s;ettlements, as he in the offer of them, if I could per&s;uade my&s;elf to be a &s;harer in them, or &s;uffer a rever&s;ionary expectation of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them to influence my choice?</P>
<P>Indeed it concerns me not a little, that my friends could be brought to encourage &s;uch offers on <HI>&s;uch</HI> motives as I think a per&s;on of con&s;cience &s;hould not pre&s;ume to begin the world with.</P>
<P>But this, it &s;eems, is the only method that can be taken to di&s;appoint Mr. Lovelace; and at the &s;ame time to an&s;wer all my relations have to wi&s;h for each of us. And <HI>&s;ure</HI> I will not &s;tand again&s;t &s;uch an ac|ce&s;&s;ion to the family, as may happen from marrying Mr. Solmes: Since now a <HI>po&s;&s;ibility</HI> is di&s;cover'd (which &s;uch a gra&s;ping mind as my brother's can ea&s;ily turn into a <HI>probability),</HI> that my grandfather's e&s;tate will revert to it, with a much more con&s;ider|able one of the man's own. In&s;tances of e&s;tates falling in, in ca&s;es far more unlikely than this, are in&s;i&s;ted on; and my &s;i&s;ter &s;ays, in the words of an old &s;aw, <HI>It is good to be related to an e&s;tate.</HI></P>
<P>While Solmes, &s;miling no doubt to him&s;elf at a hope &s;o remote, by <HI>offers</HI> only, obtains all their inter|e&s;ts; and doubts not to join to his own the e&s;tate I am envied for; which, for the conveniency of its &s;ituation between two of his, will it &s;eems be of twice the value to him that it would be of to any other per&s;on; and is therefore, I doubt not, a &s;tronger motive with him than the wife.</P>
<P>The&s;e, my dear, &s;eem to me the principal induce|ments of my relations to e&s;pou&s;e, &s;o vehemently as they do, this man's &s;uit. And here, once more, mu&s;t I de|plore the family-fault, which gives tho&s;e inducements &s;uch a force, as it will be, difficult to re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="93">And thus far, let matters with regard to Mr. Solmes and me come out as they will, my brother has &s;uc|ceeded in his views: that is to &s;ay, he has, in the fir&s;t place, got my FATHER to make the cau&s;e his own, and to in&s;i&s;t upon my compliance as an act of duty.</P>
<P>My MAMMA has never thought fit to oppo&s;e my father's will, when once he has declar'd him&s;elf deter|min'd.</P>
<P>My UNCLES, &s;tiff, unbroken, highly-pro&s;perous bachelors, give me leave to &s;ay, tho' very worthy gentlemen in the main, have as high notions of a child's duty, as of a wife's obedience; in the <HI>la&s;t</HI> of which, my mamma's meekne&s;s has confirm'd them, and given them greater rea&s;on to expect the <HI>fir&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>My aunt HERVEY (not extremely happy in her own nuptials, and perhaps under &s;ome little obliga|tion) is got over, and choo&s;es not to open her lips in my favour, again&s;t the wills of a father and uncles &s;o determin'd.</P>
<P>This pa&s;&s;ivene&s;s in her and in my mamma, in a point &s;o contrary to their own fir&s;t judgments, is too &s;trong a proof that my papa is ab&s;olutely re&s;olv'd.</P>
<P>Their tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tment of my worthy Mrs. NORTON is a &s;ad confirmation of it: A woman de&s;erving of all con|&s;ideration for her wi&s;dom; and every-body thinking &s;o; but who, not being wealthy enough to have due weight in a point again&s;t which &s;he has given her opi|nion, and which they &s;eem bent upon carrying, is re&s;train'd from vi&s;iting here, and even from corre|&s;ponding with me, as I am this very day inform'd.</P>
<P>Hatred to Lovelace, family aggrandizement, and this great motive <HI>paternal authority!</HI>&mdash;What a force <HI>united!</HI>&mdash;when, <HI>&s;ingly,</HI> each con&s;ideration is &s;uffi|cient to carry all before it!</P>
<P>This is the formidable appearance which the ad|dre&s;s of this di&s;agreeable man wears at pre&s;ent!</P>
<P>My BROTHER and my SISTER triumph.&mdash;<HI>They have got me down,</HI> is their expre&s;&s;ion, as Hannah, over-hearing

And &s;o they have (yet I ne|ver knew that I was in&s;olently <HI>up)</HI>; for now my bro|ther will either lay me under an obligation to comply, to my own unhappine&s;s, and &s;o make me an in&s;tru|ment of his revenge upon Lovelace; or, if I refu&s;e, throw me into di&s;grace with my whole family.</P>
<P>Who will wonder at the intrigues and plots carried on by undermining courtiers again&s;t one another, when a private family, but three of which can po&s;&s;ibly have cla&s;hing intere&s;ts, and one of them, as &s;he pre|&s;umes to think, above &s;uch low motives, cannot be free from them?</P>
<P>What at pre&s;ent mo&s;t concerns me, is, the peace of my mamma's mind! How can the hu&s;band of <HI>&s;uch</HI> a wife (a <HI>good</HI> man too!&mdash;But oh! this prerogative of manhood!) be &s;o <HI>po&s;i</HI>-tive, &s;o unper-<HI>&s;uade</HI>-able, to one who has brought into the family, means, which they know &s;o well the value of, that methinks they &s;hould value <HI>her</HI> the more for <HI>their</HI> &s;ake!</P>
<P>They do indeed value her: But, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, &s;he has purcha&s;ed that value by her compliances: Yet has merit for which &s;he ought to be venerated; pru|dence which ought of it&s;elf to be tru&s;ted and con|formed to in every-thing.</P>
<P>But whither roves my pen? How dare a perver&s;e girl take the&s;e liberties with relations &s;o very re&s;pect|able, and whom &s;he highly re&s;pects?&mdash;What an un|happy &s;ituation is that which obliges her, in her <HI>own defence</HI> as it were, to expo&s;e <HI>their</HI> failings?</P>
<P>But you, who know how much I love and reve|rence my mamma, will judge what a difficulty I am under, to be obliged to oppo&s;e a &s;cheme which &s;he has engaged in. Yet I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> oppo&s;e it (to comply is im|po&s;&s;ible), and mu&s;t declare without delay my oppo&s;ition, or my difficulties will increa&s;e; &s;ince, as I am ju&s;t now inform'd, a lawyer has been this very day con&s;ulted (would you have believ'd it?) in relation to &s;ettle|ments.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="95">Were ours a Roman-Catholic family, how much happier for me, that they thought a Nunnery would an&s;wer all their views!&mdash;How happy, had not a cer|tain per&s;on &s;lighted &s;omebody!

<P>I will break off here.

<P>ON Hannah's depo&s;iting my long letter, begun ye&s;terday, but by rea&s;on of &s;everal interruptions, not fini&s;h'd till within this hour, &s;he found and brought me yours of this day. I thank you, my dear, for this

<P>I mu&s;t beg or &s;eek the occa&s;ion to apply to my mamma for her mediation;&mdash;for I am in danger of having a day fixed, and antipathy taken for ba&s;hful|ne&s;s.&mdash;Should not &s;i&s;ters be &s;i&s;ters to each other?

Yet mine, in &s;upport of my brother's &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and, no doubt, in concert with him, has been urging in full a&s;&s;embly, as I am told, and that with an earne&s;t|ne&s;s peculiar to her&s;elf when &s;he &s;ets upon any thing, that an ab&s;olute day be given me; and if I comply not, to be told, that it &s;hall be to the forfeiture of all my fortunes, and of all their loves.</P>
<P>She need not be &s;o officious: My brother's intere&s;t, without hers, is &s;trong enough; for he has found means to confederate all the family again&s;t me. Upon &s;ome fre&s;h provocation, or new intelligence concern|ing Mr. Lovelace (I know not what it is), they have bound them&s;elves, or are to bind them&s;elves, by a &s;ign'd paper, to one another (the Lord ble&s;s me, my dear, what &s;hall I do!), to carry this point of Mr. Solmes, in &s;upport of my father's authority, as it is called, and again&s;t Lovelace, as a libertine, and an enemy to the family: And if &s;o, I am &s;ure, I may &s;ay again&s;t <HI>me.</HI>&mdash;How impolitic in them all, to join two people in one intere&s;t, whom they wi&s;h for ever to keep a&s;under!</P>
<P>What the di&s;charg'd &s;teward reported of him was bad enough: What Mrs. Forte&s;cue &s;aid, not only confirms that bad, but gives room to think him &s;till wor&s;e:&mdash;And &s;omething my friends have come at, which, as Betty Barnes tells Hannah, is of &s;o heinous a nature, that it proves him to be the wor&s;t of men.&mdash;But, hang the man, I had almo&s;t &s;aid,&mdash;what is he to me?

<P>I HAVE both your letters at once. It is very un|happy, my dear, &s;ince your friends will have you marry, that &s;uch a merit as yours &s;hould be addre&s;&s;ed by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of worthle&s;s creatures, who have no|thing but their pre&s;umption for their excu&s;e.</P>
<P>That the&s;e pre&s;umers appear not in this very un|worthy light to &s;ome of your friends, is, becau&s;e their defects are not &s;o &s;triking to them, as to others.&mdash;And why? Shall I venture to tell you?&mdash;Becau&s;e they are nearer their own &s;tandard.&mdash;<HI>Mode&s;ty,</HI> after all, per|haps has a concern in it; for how &s;hould they think,
<PB N="87" REF="98">
that a <HI>niece</HI> or a <HI>&s;i&s;ter</HI> of <HI>theirs</HI> (I will not go higher, for fear of incurring your di&s;plea&s;ure) &s;hould be an angel?&mdash;But where indeed is the man to be found, who has the lea&s;t &s;hare of due diffidence, that dares to look up to Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe with hope, or with any thing but wi&s;hes? Thus the bold and for|ward, not being &s;en&s;ible of their defects, a&s;pire; while the mode&s;ty of the really worthy fills them with too much reverence to permit them to explain them&s;elves. Hence your Symmes's, your Byron's, your Mullins's, your Wyerley's (the be&s;t of the herd), and your Solmes's, in turn invade you&mdash;Wretches that, look|ing upon the re&s;t of your family, need not de&s;pair of &s;ucceeding in an alliance with it:&mdash;But, to you, what an inexcu&s;able pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;umption!</P>
<P>Yet I am afraid all oppo&s;ition will be in vain. You mu&s;t, you will, I doubt, be &s;acrificed to this odious man!&mdash;I know your family!&mdash;There will be no re|&s;i&s;ting &s;uch baits as he has thrown out.&mdash;O, my dear, my beloved friend! and are &s;uch charming qualities, is &s;uch exalted merit, to be &s;unk in &s;uch a marriage!&mdash;You mu&s;t not, your uncle tells my mamma, di&s;|pute their authority. AUTHORITY! what a full word is that in the mouth of a narrow-minded per&s;on, who happen'd to be born thirty years before one!&mdash;Of your uncles I &s;peak; for as to the <HI>parental</HI> autho|rity, That ought to be &s;acred.&mdash;But &s;hould not pa|rents have <HI>rea&s;on</HI> for what they do?</P>
<P>Wonder not, however, at your Bell's un&s;i&s;terly behaviour in this affair: I have a particular to add to the inducements your in&s;olent brother is govern'd by, which will account for all her driving. Her <HI>outward eye,</HI> as <HI>you</HI> have own'd, was from <HI>the fir&s;t</HI> &s;truck with the figure and addre&s;s of the man whom &s;he pretends to de&s;pi&s;e, and who 'tis certain thoroughly de&s;pi&s;es her: But you have not told us, that <HI>&s;till</HI> &s;he loves him of all men. Bell has a meanne&s;s in her very pride; and no one is &s;o proud as Bell. She has own'd
<PB N="88" REF="99">
her love, her unea&s;y days, and &s;leeple&s;s nights, and her revenge grafted upon it, to her favourite Betty Barnes.&mdash;To lay her&s;elf in the power of a &s;ervant's tongue!&mdash;Poor creature!&mdash;But LIKE little &s;ouls will find one another out, and mingle, as well as LIKE great ones. This, however, &s;he told the wench in &s;trict confidence: And thus, by way of the <HI>female round-about,</HI> as Lovelace had the &s;aucine&s;s on &s;uch another occa&s;ion, in ridicule of our &s;ex, to call it, Betty (plea&s;ed to be thought worthy of a &s;ecret, and to have an opportunity of inveighing again&s;t Love|lace's perfidy, as &s;he would have it to be) told it to one of <HI>her</HI> confidants: That confidant, with like injunctions of &s;ecrecy, to Mi&s;s Lloyd's Harriot&mdash;Har|riot to Mi&s;s Lloyd&mdash;Mi&s;s Lloyd to <HI>me</HI>&mdash;I to you&mdash;with leave to make what you plea&s;e of it.&mdash;And now you will not wonder to find in Mi&s;s Bell an im|placable rivale&s;s, rather than an affectionate &s;i&s;ter; and will be able to account for the words <HI>witchcraft, &s;yren,</HI> and &s;uch-like, thrown out again&s;t you; and for her driving on for a fixed day for &s;acrificing you to Solmes: In &s;hort, for her rudene&s;s and violence of every kind.&mdash;What a &s;weet revenge will &s;he take, as well upon Lovelace, as upon you, if &s;he can procure her rival and all-excelling &s;i&s;ter to be married to the man that &s;i&s;ter hates; and &s;o prevent her having the man whom &s;he her&s;elf loves (whether <HI>&s;he</HI> have hope of him, or not), and whom &s;he &s;u&s;pects her &s;i&s;ter loves! Poi&s;ons and poniards have often been &s;et to work by minds inflam'd by di&s;appointed love and re|venge; will you wonder then, that the ties of rela|tion&s;hip in &s;uch a ca&s;e have no force, and that a &s;i&s;ter forgets to be a &s;i&s;ter?</P>
<P>This her &s;ecret motive (the more re&s;i&s;tle&s;s, becau&s;e her pride is concern'd to make her di&s;avow it), join'd with her former envy, and with the general and avowed inducements particularized by you, now it is known, fills me with apprehen&s;ions for you: Join'd

<P>Before the u&s;ual breakfa&s;t-time was over, my papa withdrew with my mamma, telling her he wanted to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eak to her. My &s;i&s;ter, and my aunt, who was with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, next dropt away.</P>

<P>I had but ju&s;t got into my own apartment, and be|gan to think of &s;ending Hannah to beg an audience of my mamma (the more encouraged by her conde|&s;cending goodne&s;s at breakfa&s;t), when Shorey, her woman, brought me her commands to attend her in her clo&s;et.</P>
<P>My papa, Hannah told me, had ju&s;t gone out of it with a po&s;itive, angry countenance. Then I as much dreaded the audience, as I had wi&s;hed for it before.</P>
<P>I went down, however; but, apprehending the &s;ubject, approached her trembling, and my heart in vi&s;ible palpitations.</P>
<P>She &s;aw my concern. Holding out her kind arms, as &s;he &s;at, Come ki&s;s me, my dear, &s;aid &s;he, with a &s;mile like a &s;un-beam breaking thro' the cloud that over&s;hadowed her naturally benign a&s;pect. Why flut|ters my jewel &s;o?</P>
<P>This preparative &s;weetne&s;s, with her goodne&s;s ju&s;t before, confirmed my apprehen&s;ions. My mamma &s;aw the bitter pill wanted gilding.</P>
<P>O my mamma! was all I could &s;ay; and I cla&s;p'd my arms round her neck, and my face &s;unk into her bo&s;om.</P>
<P>My child! my child! re&s;train, &s;aid &s;he, your powers of moving!&mdash;I dare not el&s;e tru&s;t my&s;elf with you.&mdash;And my tears trickled down her bo&s;om, as hers bedew'd my neck.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="106">O the words of kindne&s;s, all to be expre&s;s'd in vain, that flow'd from her lips!</P>

<P>Then ri&s;ing, &s;he drew a chair near her own, and made me &s;it down by her, overwhelm'd as I was with tears of apprehen&s;ion of what &s;he had to &s;ay, and of gratitude for her truly maternal goodne&s;s to me; &s;obs &s;till my only language.</P>
<P>And drawing her chair &s;till nearer to mine, &s;he put her arms round my neck, and my glowing cheek, wet with my tears, clo&s;e to her own: Let me talk to you, my child; &s;ince &s;ilence is your choice, hearken to me, and <HI>be</HI> &s;ilent.</P>
<P>You know, my dear, what I every day forego, and undergo, for the &s;ake of peace: Your papa is a very good man, and means well; but he will not be controuled; nor yet per&s;uaded.

<P>And then &s;he withdrew into the next apartment; wiping her eyes, as &s;he went from me; as mine over|flow'd; my heart taking in the whole compa&s;s of her meaning.</P>
<P>She &s;oon returned, having recover'd more &s;teadi|ne&s;s.</P>

<P>There went the dagger to my heart, and down I &s;unk; and when I recover'd, found my&s;elf in the arms of my Hannah, my &s;i&s;ter's Betty holding open my reluctantly open'd palm, my laces cut, my linen &s;cented with harts-horn; and my mamma gone.&mdash;Had I been <HI>le&s;s</HI> kindly treated, the hated name &s;till

<P>Shorey came in with a me&s;&s;age, deliver'd in her &s;olemn way: Your mamma, Mi&s;s, is concern'd for your di&s;order: She expects you down again in an hour; and bid me &s;ay, that &s;he then hopes every thing from your duty.</P>
<P>I made no reply; for what could I &s;ay? And lean|ing upon my Hannah's arm, withdrew to my own apartment. There you will gue&s;s how the greate&s;t part of the hour was employed.</P>

<P>She took my hand, led the way, and made me &s;it down by her: And after &s;he had inquired how I did, &s;he began in a &s;train, as if &s;he had &s;uppo&s;ed I had made u&s;e of the intervening &s;pace, to overcome all my objections.</P>

<P>MY mamma, on her return, which was as &s;oon as &s;he had din'd, was plea&s;ed to inform me, that &s;he told my papa, on his que&s;tioning her about my <HI>chearful</HI> compliance (for it &s;eems, the <HI>chearful</HI> was all that was doubted), that &s;he was willing, on &s;o ma|terial a point, to give a child whom &s;he had &s;o <HI>much rea&s;on to love</HI> (as &s;he conde&s;cended to acknowlege were her words) liberty to &s;ay all that was in her heart to &s;ay, that her compliance might be the freer: Letting him know, that when he came up, &s;he was attending to my pleas; for that &s;he found I had rather not marry at all.</P>
<P>She told me, that to this my papa angrily &s;aid, Let her take care&mdash;Let her take care&mdash;that &s;he give me not ground to &s;u&s;pect her of a preference &s;omewhere

el&s;e. But, if it be to ea&s;e her heart, and not to di&s;|pute my will, you may hear her out.</P>
<P>So, Clary, &s;aid my mamma, I am returned in a temper accordingly, if you do not again, by <HI>your</HI> peremptorine&s;s, &s;hew <HI>me,</HI> how I ought to treat <HI>you.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, you did me ju&s;tice, to &s;ay, I have no inclination to marry at all. I have not, I hope, made my&s;elf &s;o <HI>very</HI> unu&s;eful in my papa's f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mily, as&mdash;</P>
<P>No more of your merits, Clary! You have been a good child: You have ea&s;ed me of all the family cares: But do not now add more than ever you re|lieved me from. You have been richly repaid in the reputation your &s;kill and management have given you:&mdash;But now there is &s;oon to be a period to all tho&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tances from you. If you marry, there will be a natural, and, if to plea&s;e us, a de&s;irable period; becau&s;e your own family will employ all your talents in that way: If you do not, there will be a period likewi&s;e, but <HI>not</HI> a natural one:&mdash;You under&s;tand me, child.</P>
<P>I wept.</P>
<P>I have made inquiry already after a hou&s;ekeeper. I would have had your good Norton; but I &s;uppo&s;e you will your&s;elf wi&s;h to have the worthy woman with you. If you de&s;ire it, that &s;hall be agreed upon for you.</P>

<P>I might refer you for an an&s;wer to your <HI>papa.</HI>&mdash;Mr. Solmes has rea&s;ons for preferring <HI>you</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>And &s;o have I, Madam, for di&s;liking <HI>him.</HI> And why am I&mdash;</P>

<P>I wept for vexation. This is all, all, my brother's doings&mdash;His gra&s;ping views&mdash;</P>
<P>No reflections upon your brother: He has intirely the honour of the family at heart.</P>
<P>I would no more di&s;honour my family, Madam, than my brother would.</P>
<P>I believe it: But I hope you'll allow your papa, and me, and your uncles, to judge what will do it honour, what di&s;honour!</P>
<P>I then offer'd to live &s;ingle; never to marry at all; or never but with their full approbation.</P>
<P>If I meant to &s;hew my duty, and my obedience, I mu&s;t &s;hew it in <HI>their</HI> way; not <HI>my own.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;aid, I hoped I had &s;o behaved my&s;elf hitherto, that there was no need of &s;uch a trial of my obe|dience as this.</P>
<P>Yes, &s;he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, I had behaved ex|tremely well: But I had no trials till now: And &s;he hoped, that now I was called to one, I &s;hould not fail in it.

<P>Madam, my grandfather knew, and expre&s;ly men|tions in his will his de&s;ire, that my papa will more than make it up to my &s;i&s;ter&mdash;I did nothing but what I thought my duty, to procure his favour.

<P>I an&s;wer'd to every article &s;he had &s;poken to as above, in &s;uch a manner, as I am &s;ure would have &s;atisfy'd her, could &s;he have been permitted to judge for her&s;elf; and then inveighed with bitterne&s;s again&s;t the di&s;graceful prohibitions laid upon me.</P>

<P>I own to you, Clary, altho' now I would not have it known, that I once thought a little qualifying among &s;uch violent &s;pirits, was not ami&s;s. I did not know but all things would come round again by Lord M.'s and his two &s;i&s;ters mediation: But as they all three think proper to re&s;ent for their nephew; and as their nephew thinks fit to defy us all; and as terms are offer'd on another hand, that could not be a&s;ked, which will very probably prevent your grandfather's e&s;tate going out of the family, and may be a means to bring a &s;till greater into it; I &s;ee not, that the continuance of your corre&s;pondence with him either can, or ought to be permitted.

what the view is; and as I have rea&s;on to think, that he is only re&s;trained by his regard for me from re|&s;enting their violent treatment of him and his family; what can I do?&mdash;Would you have me, Madam, make him de&s;perate?</P>
<P>The Law will protect us, child!&mdash;Offended magi|&s;tracy will a&s;&s;ert it&s;elf&mdash;</P>
<P>But, Madam, may not &s;ome dreadful mi&s;chief fir&s;t happen?&mdash;The Law a&s;&s;erts not it&s;elf, till it is of|fended.</P>
<P>You have made offers, Clary, if you might be obliged in the point in que&s;tion:&mdash;Are you really in earne&s;t, on that condition to break off all corre&s;pond|ence with Mr. Lovelace?&mdash;Let me know this.</P>
<P>Indeed, I am; and I will. You, Madam, &s;hall &s;ee every letter that has pa&s;&s;ed between us.

<P>I begg'd her pardon; and be&s;ought her to take the key of the private drawer in my e&s;crutoire, where they lay, that &s;he her&s;elf might &s;ee, that I had no re&s;erves to my mamma.</P>

<P>In the&s;e three, as in tho&s;e you have &s;een, after having be&s;ought my favour, and, in the mo&s;t earne&s;t manner, profe&s;&s;ed the &s;incerity of his pa&s;&s;ion for me; and &s;et forth the indignities done him; the defiances my brother throws out again&s;t him in all companies; the menaces, and ho&s;tile appearance of my uncles, where-ever they go, or come; and the methods they take to defame him; he declares,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That neither his own honour, nor his family's (involved as that is in the undi&s;tingui&s;hing reflections ca&s;t upon him for an un|happy affair, which he would have &s;hunn'd, but could not), permit him to bear the&s;e confirmed in|dignities: That as my inclinations, if not favour|able to <HI>him,</HI> cannot be, nor are, to &s;uch a man as the new-&s;et-up Solmes, he is intere&s;ted the more to re&s;ent my brother's behaviour; who to every-body avows his rancour and malice; and glories in the probability he has, thro' this Solmes's addre&s;s, of mortifying <HI>me,</HI> and avenging him&s;elf on <HI>him:</HI> That it is impo&s;&s;ible, he &s;hould not think him&s;elf con|cern'd to fru&s;trate a mea&s;ure, &s;o directly level'd at him, had he not &s;till a higher motive for hoping to fru&s;trate it: That I mu&s;t forgive him, if he enters into conference with Solmes upon it.

But <HI>can</HI> you think from the avowed hatred of one &s;ide, and the avowed defiance of the other, that this can be a &s;uitable match? <HI>Can</HI> you think it becomes you to encourage an ad|dre&s;s from a man who has fought a duel with your brother, let his fortune and profe&s;&s;ions be what they will?</P>
<P>By no means it can, Madam; you will be plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve, that I have &s;aid as much to him. But now, Madam, the whole corre&s;pondence is before you; and I beg your commands what to do in a &s;itua|tion &s;o very di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>One thing I will tell you, Clary Harlowe: But I charge you, as you would not have me que&s;tion the genero&s;ity of your &s;pirit, to take no advantage of it, either <HI>mentally</HI> or <HI>verbally,</HI> were the words: That I am &s;o much plea&s;ed with the offer of your keys to me, in &s;o chearful and unre&s;erved a manner, and in the prudence you have &s;hewn in your letters, that were it practicable to bring every one, or your father only, into my opinion, I &s;hould readily leave all the re&s;t to your di&s;cretion, re&s;erving only to my&s;elf the direction or approbation of your future letters; and to &s;ee, that you broke off the corre&s;pondence, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.

<P>Without he&s;itation (for I &s;aw I was upon a new trial) thus I an&s;wer'd&mdash;What I humbly propo&s;e is this:&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That I will write to Mr. Lovelace (for I have not an&s;wer'd his la&s;t) that he has nothing to do between my father and me: That I neither <HI>a&s;k</HI> his advice, nor <HI>need</HI> it: But that &s;ince he thinks he has &s;ome pretence for interfering, becau&s;e of my bro|ther's avowal of the intere&s;t of Mr. Solmes in ma|lice to him, I will a&s;&s;ure him, without giving him any rea&s;on to impute the a&s;&s;urance to be in the lea&s;t favourable to him&s;elf, that I never will be that man's.'</Q>
And if, proceeded I, I may be permitted to give him this a&s;&s;urance; and Mr. Solmes, in con&s;equence of it, be di&s;couraged from pro&s;ecuting his addre&s;s; let Mr. Lovelace be &s;atisfy'd or di&s;&s;atisfy'd, I will go no farther; nor write another line to him; nor ever &s;ee him more, if I can avoid it: And &s;hall have a good excu&s;e for it, without bringing in any of my family.</P>
<P>Ah! my love!&mdash;But what &s;hall we do about the <HI>terms</HI> Mr. Solmes offers? Tho&s;e are the inducements with every-body: He has even given hopes to your brother that he will make exchanges of e&s;tates; or at lea&s;t, that he will purcha&s;e the northern one; for, you know, it mu&s;t be intirely con&s;i&s;tent with the family views, that we increa&s;e our intere&s;t in this county. Your brother, in &s;hort, has given in a plan that captivates us all: And a family &s;o rich in all its branches, that has it's views to honour, mu&s;t be plea&s;ed to &s;ee a very great probability of being on a footing with the principal in the kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="129">And for the &s;ake of the&s;e views, for the &s;ake of this plan of my brother's, am I, Madam, to be given in marriage to a man I never can endure!&mdash;O my dear mamma, &s;ave me, &s;ave me, if you can, from this heavy evil!&mdash;I had rather be bury'd alive, indeed I had, than have that man!</P>

<P>She went down to tea, and kindly undertook to excu&s;e my attendance at &s;upper: And I immediately had recour&s;e to my pen, to give you the&s;e particulars.</P>
<P>But is it not a &s;ad thing, I repeat, to be obliged to &s;tand in oppo&s;ition to the will of &s;uch a mamma? Why, as I often &s;ay to my&s;elf, was &s;uch a man as this Solmes fix'd upon? The only man in the world, &s;urely, that could offer &s;o much, and de&s;erve &s;o little!</P>
<P>Little indeed does he de&s;erve!&mdash;Why, my dear, the man has the mo&s;t indifferent of characters. Every mouth is open'd again&s;t him for his &s;ordid ways&mdash;A <HI>fooli&s;h</HI> man, to be &s;o ba&s;e-minded!&mdash;When the dif|ference between the obtaining of a fame for genero&s;ity, and incurring the cen&s;ure of being a mi&s;er, will not, prudently manag'd, co&s;t fifty pounds a year.</P>
<P>What a name have you got, at a le&s;s expence? And what an opportunity had he of obtaining credit at a very &s;mall one, &s;ucceeding &s;uch a wretched crea|ture as Sir Oliver, in fortunes &s;o va&s;t?&mdash;Yet has he &s;o behaved, that the common phra&s;e is apply'd to him, <HI>That Sir</HI> Oliver <HI>will never be dead, while Mr.</HI> Solmes <HI>lives.</HI></P>
<P>The world, as I have often thought, ill-natured as it is &s;aid to be, is generally more ju&s;t in characters (&s;peaking by what it <HI>feels</HI>), than is u&s;ually apprehend|ed: And tho&s;e who complain mo&s;t of its cen&s;oriou&s;|ne&s;s,

perhaps &s;hould look <HI>inwardly</HI> for the occa&s;ion oftener than they do.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Sat. Mar. 4.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WOULD you not have thought, that &s;omething might have been obtained in my favour, from an offer &s;o rea&s;onable, from an expedient &s;o proper, as I imagine, to put a tolerable end, as <HI>from my&s;elf,</HI> to a corre&s;pondence I hardly know how, otherwi&s;e, with &s;afety to &s;ome of my family, to get rid of!&mdash;But my brother's plan (which my mamma &s;poke of, and of which I have in vain endeavour'd to procure a copy, with a de&s;ign of taking it to pieces, and expo&s;ing it, as I que&s;tion not there is room to do), together with my papa's impatience of contradiction, is irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>I have not been in bed all night; nor am I in the lea&s;t drou&s;y. Expectation, and hope, and doubt (an unea&s;y &s;tate!), kept me &s;ufficiently wakeful. I &s;tept
<PB N="120" REF="131">
down at my u&s;ual time, that it might not be known I had not been in bed; and gave directions in the fa|mily way.</P>
<P>About eight o' clock Shorey came to me from my mamma, with orders to attend her in her chamber.</P>
<P>My mamma had been weeping, I &s;aw by her eyes: But her a&s;pect &s;eem'd to be le&s;s tender, and le&s;s af|fectionate, than the day before; and this &s;truck me with an awe, as &s;oon as I entered her pre&s;ence, which gave a great damp to my &s;pirits.</P>
<P>Sit down, Clary Harlowe; I &s;hall talk to you by-and-by: And was looking into a drawer among laces and linen, in a way neither bu&s;y nor unbu&s;y.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time, &s;he a&s;k'd me coldly, What direc|tions I had given for the day?</P>
<P>I gave her the bill of fare for this day, and to|morrow, if, I &s;aid, it plea&s;ed her to approve of it.</P>
<P>She made a &s;mall alteration in it; but with an air &s;o cold and &s;o &s;olemn, as added to the emotions I en|ter'd into her pre&s;ence with.</P>
<P>Mr. Harlowe talks of dining out to-day, I think, at my brother Antony's.&mdash;</P>
<P>Mr. Harlowe!&mdash;Not my papa!&mdash;Have I not then a papa!&mdash;thought I?</P>
<P>Sit down when I bid you.</P>
<P>I &s;at down.</P>
<P>You look very &s;ullen, Clary.</P>
<P>I hope not, Madam.</P>
<P>If children would always be children&mdash;parents&mdash;And there &s;he &s;topt.</P>
<P>She then went to her toilette, and looked in the gla&s;s, and gave half a &s;igh&mdash;the other half, as if &s;he would not have &s;ighed, could &s;he have help'd it, &s;he gently hem'd away.</P>
<P>I don't love to &s;ee the girl look &s;o &s;ullen.</P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, I am not &s;ullen.&mdash;And I aro&s;e, and, turning from her, drew out my handkerchief, for the tears ran down my cheeks. I thought, by
<PB N="121" REF="132">
the gla&s;s before me, I &s;aw the <HI>mother</HI> in her &s;often'd eye ca&s;t towards me.&mdash;But her words confirm'd not the hop'd-for tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>One of the provoking'&s;t things in the world is, to have people cry for what they can help!</P>
<P>I wi&s;h to heaven I could, Madam!&mdash;and I &s;obb'd again.</P>
<P>Tears of penitence and &s;obs of perver&s;ene&s;s are mighty well &s;uited!&mdash;You may go up to your chamber. I &s;hall talk with you by-and-by.</P>
<P>I courte&s;y'd with reverence.&mdash;</P>
<P>Mock me not with outward ge&s;ture of re&s;pect. The heart, Clary, is what I want.</P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, you have it. It is not &s;o much mine, as my mamma's!</P>
<P>Fine talking!&mdash;As &s;omebody &s;ays, If words were duty, Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe would be the dutifulle&s;t child breathing.</P>
<P>God ble&s;s that &s;omebody!&mdash;Be it whom it will, God ble&s;s that &s;omebody!&mdash;And I courte&s;y'd, and, pur&s;uant to her la&s;t command, was going.</P>
<P>She &s;eem'd &s;truck; but <HI>was</HI> to be angry with me.</P>
<P>So turning from me, &s;he &s;poke with quickne&s;s, Whither now, Clary Harlowe?</P>
<P>You commanded me, Madam, to go to my cham|ber.</P>
<P>I &s;ee you are very ready to go out of my pre&s;ence. Is your compliance the effect of &s;ullenne&s;s, or obe|dience?&mdash;You are very ready to leave me.</P>
<P>I could hold no longer; but threw my&s;elf at her feet: O my deare&s;t mamma! Let me know all I am to &s;uffer: Let me know what I am to be! I will bear it, if I <HI>can</HI> bear it: But your di&s;plea&s;ure I can|not bear!</P>
<P>Leave me, leave me, Clary Harlowe!&mdash;No kneel|ing!&mdash;Limbs &s;o &s;upple; Will &s;o &s;tubborn!&mdash;Ri&s;e, I tell you.</P>
<P>I cannot ri&s;e! I will di&s;obey my mamma, when

&s;he bids me leave her, without her being reconciled to me! No &s;ullens, my mamma: No perver&s;ene&s;s: But, wor&s;e than either, This is direct di&s;obedience!&mdash;Yet tear not your&s;elf from me! (wrapping my arms about her as I kneeled; &s;he &s;truggling to get from me; my face lifted up to hers, with eyes running over, that &s;poke not my heart if they were not all humility and reverence.) You mu&s;t not, mu&s;t not, tear your&s;elf from me! (for &s;till the dear lady &s;trug|gled, and looked this way and that, in a &s;weet di&s;or|der, as if &s;he knew not what to do.)&mdash;I will neither ri&s;e, nor leave you, nor let you go, till you &s;ay you are not angry with me.</P>
<P>O thou ever-moving child of my heart! (folding her dear arms about my neck, as mine embraced her knees.) Why was this ta&s;k!&mdash;But leave me!&mdash;You have di&s;compo&s;ed me beyond expre&s;&s;ion!&mdash;Leave me, my dear!&mdash;I won't be angry with you&mdash;if I can help it&mdash;if you'll be good.</P>
<P>I aro&s;e trembling, and, hardly knowing what I did, or how I &s;tood or walk'd, withdrew to my chamber. My Hannah followed me, as &s;oon as &s;he heard me quit my mamma's pre&s;ence, and with &s;alts and &s;pring-water ju&s;t kept me from fainting; and that was as much as &s;he could do. It was near two hours before I could &s;o far recover my&s;elf as to take up my pen, to write to you how unhappily my hopes have ended.</P>
<P>My mamma went down to breakfa&s;t. I was not fit to appear: But if I had been better, I &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hould not have been &s;ent for; my papa's hint, when in my chamber, being, To bring me down, if worthy of the name of daughter.

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Sat. March 4. 12 o' clock.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HANNAH has ju&s;t now brought me from the u&s;ual place your favour of ye&s;terday. The con|tents of it have made me very thoughtful; and you will have an an&s;wer in my grave&s;t &s;tyle.&mdash;<HI>I</HI> to have that Mr. Solmes!&mdash;No indeed!&mdash;I will &s;ooner&mdash;But I will write fir&s;t to other parts of your letter that are le&s;s concerning, that I may touch upon this part with more patience.</P>
<P>As to what you mention of my &s;i&s;ter's value for Mr. Lovelace, I am not very much &s;urpri&s;ed at it. She takes &s;uch <HI>officious</HI> pains, and it is &s;o much her &s;ub|ject, to have it thought that &s;he never <HI>did,</HI> and never <HI>could</HI> like him, that &s;he gives but too much room to &s;u&s;pect her. Then &s;he never tells the &s;tory of their parting, and of her refu&s;al of him, but her colour ri&s;es, &s;he looks with di&s;dain upon me, and mingles anger with the airs &s;he gives her&s;elf:&mdash;Both anger and airs, at lea&s;t, demon&s;trating, that &s;he refu&s;ed a man whom &s;he thought worth accepting: Where el&s;e is the rea&s;on either for anger or boa&s;t?&mdash;Poor Bella! She is to be pity'd!&mdash;She cannot either like or di&s;like with temper!&mdash;Would to heaven &s;he had been mi&s;tre&s;s of all her wi&s;hes!&mdash;Would to heaven &s;he had!&mdash;</P>
<P>As to the article of giving up to my papa's controul the e&s;tate bequeathed me, my motives at the time, as you acknowlege, were not blameable. Your advice to me on the &s;ubject was grounded, as I remember, on your good opinion of me; believing that I &s;hould not make a bad u&s;e of the power willed me: Neither you nor I, my dear, altho' you now a&s;&s;ume the air of a diviner (pardon me), could have believed That would have happen'd which has happen'd, as to my <HI>father</HI>'s
<PB N="124" REF="135">
part particularly. You were indeed jealous of my bro|ther's views again&s;t me; or rather of his predominant love of Self; but I did not think &s;o hardly of my bro|ther and &s;i&s;ter, as you always did. You never loved them; and ill-will has eyes always open to the faulty &s;ide; as good-will or love is blind even to real imper|fections. I will briefly recollect my motives.</P>
<P>I found jealou&s;ies and unea&s;ine&s;s ri&s;ing in every brea&s;t, where all before was unity and love: The ho|noured te&s;tator was reflected upon: A &s;econd child|hood was attributed to him; and I was cen&s;ured, as having taken advantage of it. All young creatures, thought I, more or le&s;s, covet independency; but tho&s;e who wi&s;h mo&s;t for it, are &s;eldom the fitte&s;t to be tru&s;ted either with the government of them&s;elves, or with power over others. This is certainly a very high and unu&s;ual beque&s;t to &s;o young a creature. We &s;hould not aim at <HI>all</HI> we have power to do. To take all that good-nature, or indulgence, or good opinion con|fers, &s;hews a want of moderation, and a gra&s;pingne&s;s that is unworthy of that indulgence; and are bad indi|cations of the <HI>u&s;e</HI> that may be made of the power be|queathed. It is true, thought I, that I have formed agreeable &s;chemes of making others as happy as my|&s;elf, by the proper di&s;charge of the &s;teward&s;hip intru&s;ted to me (Are not all e&s;tates &s;teward&s;hips, my dear?): But let me examine my&s;elf: Is not vanity, or &s;ecret love of prai&s;e, a principal motive with me at the bot|tom?&mdash;Ought I not to &s;u&s;pect my own heart? If I &s;et up for my&s;elf, puffed up with every one's good opinion, may I not be <HI>left</HI> to my&s;elf?&mdash;Every one's eyes are upon the conduct, upon the vi&s;its, upon the vi&s;it-<HI>ors</HI> of a young creature of our &s;ex, made inde|pendent: And are not &s;uch, moreover, the &s;ubjects of the attempts of the <HI>wor&s;t</HI> of the other?&mdash;And then, left to my&s;elf, &s;hould I take a wrong &s;tep, tho' with ever &s;o good an intention, how many &s;hould I have to triumph over me, how few to pity?&mdash;The more
<PB N="125" REF="136">
of the one, and the fewer of the other, for having aimed at excelling.</P>
<P>The&s;e were &s;ome of my reflections at the time: And I have no doubt, but that in the &s;ame &s;ituation I &s;hould do the very &s;ame thing; and that upon the ma|ture&s;t deliberation. Who can command or fore&s;ee events? To act up to our be&s;t judgments at the time, is all we can do. If I have err'd, 'tis to worldly wi&s;|dom only that I have err'd. If we &s;uffer by an act of duty, or even by an act of genero&s;ity, is it not plea|&s;urable on reflection, that the fault is in others, rather than in our&s;elves?&mdash;I had rather, a va&s;t deal, have rea|&s;on to think others unkind, than that they &s;hould have any to think me undutiful. And &s;o, my dear, I am &s;ure had you.</P>
<P>And now for the <HI>mo&s;t</HI> concerning part of your letter.</P>
<P>You think I mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be Mr. Solmes's wife, as matters are circum&s;tanced. I will not be very ra&s;h, my dear, in prote&s;ting to the contrary: But I think it never, never can, nor <HI>ought</HI> to be!&mdash;My temper, I know, is depended upon: But I have heretofore &s;aid, that I have &s;omething in me of my father's family, as well as of my mother's <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Letter <HI>ix.</HI> p. <HI>50.</HI></NOTE>. And have I any encou|ragement to follow too implicitly the example which my mamma &s;ets of meekne&s;s, and re&s;ignedne&s;s to the wills of others?&mdash;Is &s;he not for ever obliged to be, as &s;he was plea&s;ed to hint to me, of the <HI>forbearing</HI> &s;ide? In my mamma's ca&s;e, your ob&s;ervation is verify'd, that tho&s;e who will bear much, &s;hall have much to bear:&mdash;What is it, as &s;he &s;ays, that <HI>&s;he</HI> has not &s;acrificed to peace?&mdash;Yet, has <HI>&s;he</HI> by her &s;acrifices always found the peace &s;he has de&s;erved to find? Indeed No!&mdash;I am afraid the very contrary. And often and often have I had rea&s;on, on her account, to reflect, that we poor mortals, by our <HI>over</HI>-&s;ollicitude to pre&s;erve undi&s;turbed the qualities we are con&s;titutionally fond of, frequently lo&s;e the benefits we propo&s;e to our&s;elves from them:
<PB N="126" REF="137">
Since the de&s;igning and incroaching, finding out what we mo&s;t fear to forfeit, direct their batteries again&s;t the&s;e our weaker places, and, making an artillery, if I may &s;o phra&s;e it, of our hopes and fears, play it upon us at their plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Steadine&s;s of mind (a quality which the ill-bred and cen&s;orious deny to any of our &s;ex), when one is con|vinced of being in the right (otherwi&s;e it is not &s;teadi|ne&s;s, but ob&s;tinacy), and in <HI>material</HI> ca&s;es, is a qua|lity, my good Dr. Lewin was wont to &s;ay, that brings great credit to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of it; at the &s;ame time that it u&s;ually, when <HI>try'd</HI> and <HI>known,</HI> rai&s;es <HI>&s;uch</HI> above the attempts of the meanly machinating. He u&s;ed therefore to inculcate upon me this &s;teadine&s;s, upon laudable convictions. And why may I not think that I am now put upon an exerci&s;e of it?&mdash;I have &s;aid, that I never can be, that I never ought to be, Mrs. Solmes.&mdash;I repeat, that I <HI>ought</HI> not: For &s;urely, my dear, I &s;hould not give up to my brother's am|bition the happine&s;s of my future life.&mdash;Surely I ought not to be the in&s;trument to deprive Mr. Solmes's re|lations of their natural rights and rever&s;ionary pro|&s;pects, for the &s;ake of further aggrandizing a family (altho' <HI>that</HI> I am of) which already lives in great af|fluence and &s;plendor; and who might be as ju&s;tly di&s;|&s;atisfy'd, were what &s;ome &s;ome of them aim at to be obtained, that they were not princes, as now they are, that they are not peers (for when ever was an am|bitious mind, as you ob&s;erve in the ca&s;e of avarice <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Letter <HI>x.</HI> p. <HI>55.</HI></NOTE>, &s;atisfy'd by acqui&s;ition?). The le&s;s, &s;urely, ought I to give into the&s;e gra&s;ping views of my brother, as I my&s;elf heartily de&s;pi&s;e the end aimed at; as I wi&s;h not either to change my &s;tate, or better my fortunes; and as I am fully per&s;uaded, that happine&s;s and riches are <HI>two</HI> things, and very &s;eldom meet together.</P>
<P>Yet I dread, I exceedingly dread, the conflicts I know I mu&s;t encounter with. It is po&s;&s;ible, that I

may be more unhappy from the due ob&s;ervation of the good doctor's general precept, than were I to yield the point; &s;ince what I call <HI>&s;teadine&s;s</HI> is attri|buted to &s;tubbornne&s;s, to ob&s;tinacy, to prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, by tho&s;e who have a right to put what interpretation they plea&s;e upon my conduct.</P>
<P>So, my dear, were we perfect, which no one can be, we could not be happy in this life, unle&s;s tho&s;e with whom we have to deal (tho&s;e, more e&s;pecially, who have any controul upon us), were govern'd by the &s;ame principles. What have we then to do, but as I have hinted above, to choo&s;e right, and pur&s;ue it &s;teadily, and leave the i&s;&s;ue to Providence?</P>
<P>This, if you approve of my motives (and if you don't, pray inform me), mu&s;t be my aim in the pre|&s;ent ca&s;e.</P>
<P>But what then can I plead for a palliation to <HI>my&s;elf</HI> of my mamma's &s;ufferings on <HI>my</HI> account? Perhaps This con&s;ideration will carry &s;ome force with it;&mdash;That <HI>her</HI> difficulties cannot la&s;t long; only till this great &s;truggle &s;hall be one way or other determin'd.&mdash;Whereas <HI>my</HI> unhappine&s;s, if I comply, will (from an aver&s;ion not to be overcome) be for life. To which let me add, That, as I have rea&s;on to think that the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures are not enter'd upon with her own natural liking, &s;he will have the le&s;s pain, &s;hould they want the &s;ucce&s;s which I think in my heart they ought to want.</P>
<P>I have run a great length in a very little time. The &s;ubject touch'd me to the quick. My reflections upon it will give you rea&s;on to expect from me a perhaps <HI>too</HI> &s;teady behaviour in a new conference, which, I find, I mu&s;t have with my mamma.

<P>THE expected conference is over: But my diffi|culties are increa&s;ed. This, as my mamma was plea&s;ed to tell me, being the la&s;t <HI>per&s;ua&s;ory</HI> effort that will be attempted, I will be as particular in the account of it as my head and my heart will allow me to be.</P>
<P>I have made, &s;aid &s;he, as &s;he enter'd my room, a &s;hort as well as early dinner, on purpo&s;e to confer with you: And I do a&s;&s;ure you, that it will be the la&s;t con|ference I &s;hall either be permitted or <HI>inclined</HI> to hold with you on the &s;ubject, if you &s;hould prove as refractory as &s;ome, whom I hope you'll di&s;appoint, imagine you

will; and thereby demon&s;trate, that I have not the weight with you that my indulgence to you de&s;erves.</P>
<P>Your papa both dines and &s;ups at your uncle's, on purpo&s;e to give us this opportunity; and as I &s;hall make my report (which I have promi&s;ed to do very faithfully) on his return, he will take his mea&s;ures with you.</P>
<P>I was offering to &s;peak&mdash;Hear, Clari&s;&s;a, what I have to tell you, &s;aid &s;he, before you &s;peak, unle&s;s what you have to &s;ay will &s;ignify to me your com|pliance&mdash;Say&mdash;<HI>will</HI> it?&mdash;If it <HI>will,</HI> you may &s;peak.</P>

<P>She looked with concern and anger upon me&mdash;No compliance, I find!&mdash;Such a dutiful young creature hitherto!&mdash;Will you not, can you not, &s;peak as I would have you &s;peak?&mdash;Then, rejecting me, as it were, with her hand, then, continue &s;ilent.&mdash;<HI>I,</HI> no more than your <HI>father,</HI> will bear your <HI>avowed</HI> contra|diction!&mdash;</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed, with a look of expectation, as if &s;he waited for my con&s;enting an&s;wer.</P>

<P>O thou determin'd girl!&mdash;But &s;ay; &s;peak out; are you re&s;olved to &s;tand in oppo&s;ition to us all, in a point our hearts are &s;et upon?</P>
<P>May I, Madam, be permitted to expo&s;tulate?</P>
<P>To what purpo&s;e expo&s;tulate with <HI>me,</HI> Clari&s;&s;a? Your <HI>father</HI> is determin'd.

<P>I wept. I knew not what to &s;ay; or rather how to expre&s;s what I had to &s;ay.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="141">Take notice, that there are flaws in your grand|father's will: Not a &s;hilling of that e&s;tate will be yours, if you do not yield.

<P>This was very pertly &s;aid, &s;he was plea&s;ed to tell me: But bid me reflect, that the forfeiture of that e&s;tate, thro' my oppo&s;ition, would be attended with the total lo&s;s of my papa's favour; and then how de&s;ti|tute I mu&s;t be; how unable to &s;upport my&s;elf; and how many benevolent de&s;igns and good actions mu&s;t I give up!</P>
<P>I mu&s;t accommodate my&s;elf, I &s;aid, in the latter ca&s;e, to my circum&s;tances: <HI>Much</HI> only was <HI>required</HI> where <HI>much</HI> was <HI>given.</HI> It became me to be thankful for what I had had: And I had rea&s;on to ble&s;s her and my good Mrs. Norton, for bringing me up to be &s;a|tisfied with little&mdash;with much le&s;s, I would venture to &s;ay, than my papa's indulgence annually conferr'd upon me.&mdash;And then I thought of the old Roman and his lentiles.</P>

<P>I told her, I was &s;orry that I had had &s;o little merit, as to have made no deeper impre&s;&s;ions of favour for me in their hearts: But that I would love and honour them as long as I lived.</P>
<P>All this, &s;he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, made my prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion in a certain man's favour the more evident. Indeed my brother and &s;i&s;ter could not go any-whither, but they heard of the&s;e prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>

<P>I was &s;peechle&s;s, ab&s;olutely &s;peechle&s;s: Altho' my heart was ready to bur&s;t, yet could I neither weep nor &s;peak.</P>
<P>She was &s;orry, &s;he &s;aid, for my aver&s;ene&s;s to this match <HI>(match</HI> &s;he was plea&s;ed to call it!): But there was no help. The honour and intere&s;t of the family, as my aunt had told me, and as <HI>&s;he</HI> had told me, were concern'd; and I mu&s;t comply.</P>

<P>To give you hope, my deare&s;t, my mo&s;t indulgent mamma, is to give you every thing. Can I be hone&s;t, if I give a hope that I cannot confirm?</P>
<P>She was very angry. She again called me perver&s;e: She upbraided me with regarding only my own in|clinations, and re&s;pecting not either her peace of mind, or my own duty:&mdash;

<P>That you are, my ever-honour'd mamma, is my grief.

<P>What could I do but weep?</P>
<P>I am extremely affected on my mamma's account&mdash;more, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, than on my own.&mdash;And in|deed, all things con&s;ider'd, and e&s;pecially, that the mea&s;ure &s;he is engaged in, is (as I dare &s;ay it is) again&s;t her own judgment, &s;he <HI>de&s;erves</HI> more compa&s;&s;ion than my&s;elf.&mdash;Excellent woman!

<P>But here, run away with by my pen, I &s;uffer my dear mamma to be angry with me on her own account. She hinted to me, indeed, that I mu&s;t &s;eek <HI>her,</HI> if my

mind <HI>changed</HI>; which is a condition that amounts to a prohibition:&mdash;But, as &s;he left me in di&s;plea&s;ure, will it not have a very ob&s;tinate appearance, and look like a a kind of renunciation of her mediation in my favour, if I go not down to &s;upplicate her pity, and her kind report, before my papa comes back?&mdash;</P>
<P>I will attend her. I had rather all the world &s;hould be angry with me, than my mamma!</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Sat. Night.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been down. I <HI>am</HI> to be unlucky in all I do, I think, be my intention ever &s;o good. I have made matters wor&s;e in&s;tead of better; as I &s;hall now tell you.</P>
<P>I found my mamma and &s;i&s;ter together in my &s;i&s;ter's parlour. My mamma, I fear, by the glow in her fine face (and as the browner, &s;ullener glow in my &s;i&s;ter's confirm'd), had been expre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf with warmth, again&s;t her <HI>unhappier</HI> child: Perhaps giving &s;uch an account of what had pa&s;&s;ed, as &s;hould clear her&s;elf, and convince Bella, and thro' <HI>her,</HI> my brother and uncles, of the &s;incere pains &s;he had taken with me!&mdash;</P>
<P>I enter'd like a dejected criminal, I believe;&mdash;and be&s;ought the favour of a private audience. My mam|ma's return, both looks and words, gave but too much rea&s;on for my &s;urmize.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="152">You have, &s;aid &s;he (looking at me with a &s;ternne&s;s that never &s;its well on her &s;weet features), rather a <HI>reque&s;ting</HI> than a <HI>conceding</HI> countenance, Clari&s;&s;a Har|lowe: If I am mi&s;taken, tell me &s;o; and I will with|draw with you where-ever you will.&mdash;Yet, if &s;o, or not &s;o, you may &s;ay what you have to &s;ay before your &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>My mamma, I thought, might have withdrawn with me, as &s;he knows, that I have not a friend in my &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>I came down, I &s;aid, to beg of her to forgive me for any-thing &s;he might have taken ami&s;s in what had pa&s;&s;ed above re&s;pecting her&s;elf; and to u&s;e her in|tere&s;t to &s;often my papa's di&s;plea&s;ure, when &s;he made the report &s;he was to make to him.</P>
<P>Such aggravating looks; &s;uch lifting-up of hands and eyes; &s;uch a furrow'd forehead, in my &s;i&s;ter!&mdash;</P>
<P>My mamma was angry enough without all that; and a&s;ked me, To what purpo&s;e I came down, if I were &s;till &s;o untractable?</P>
<P>She had hardly &s;poke the words, when Shorey came in to tell her, that Mr. Solmes was in the hall, and de&s;ired admittance.</P>
<P>Ugly creature! What, at the clo&s;e of day, quite dark, brought him hither?&mdash;But, on &s;econd thoughts. I believe it was contrived, that he &s;hould be here at &s;upper, to know the re&s;ult of the conference between my mamma and me; and that my papa, on his return, might find us together.</P>
<P>I was hurrying away; but my mamma commanded me, &s;ince I had come down only, as &s;he &s;aid, to mock her, not to &s;tir; and at the &s;ame time &s;ee if I could behave &s;o to him, as might encourage her to make the report to my papa which I had &s;o earne&s;tly be&s;ought her to make.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter triumphed. I was vexed to be &s;o caught, and to have &s;uch an angry and cutting rebuke given me, with an a&s;pect more like the taunting &s;i&s;ter than the indulgent mother, if I may pre&s;ume to &s;ay &s;o.&mdash;
<PB N="142" REF="153">
For my mamma her&s;elf &s;eem'd to enjoy the &s;urprize upon me.</P>
<P>The man &s;talked in. His u&s;ual walk is by pau&s;es, as if (from the &s;ame vacuity of thought which made Dryden's clown whi&s;tle) he was telling his &s;teps: and fir&s;t paid his clum&s;y re&s;pects to my mamma; then to my &s;i&s;ter; next to me, as if I were already his wife, and therefore to be la&s;t in his notice; and &s;itting down by me, told us in general what weather it was. Very cold he made it; but I was warm enough. Then ad|dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me; And how do <HI>you</HI> find it, Mi&s;s, was his que&s;tion; and would have took my hand.</P>
<P>I withdrew it, I believe with di&s;dain enough: My mamma frown'd; my &s;i&s;ter bit her lip.</P>
<P>I could not contain my&s;elf: I never was &s;o bold in my life; for I went on with my plea, as if Mr. Solmes had not been there.</P>
<P>My mamma colour'd, and look'd at him, look'd at my &s;i&s;ter, and look'd at me. My &s;i&s;ter's eyes were opener and bigger than ever I &s;aw them before.</P>
<P>The man under&s;tood me. He hemm'd, and re|mov'd from one chair to another.</P>
<P>I went on, &s;upplicating for my mamma's favour|able report: Nothing but invincible di&s;like&mdash;</P>
<P>What would the girl be at? Why, Clary!&mdash;Is this a &s;ubject!&mdash;Is this!&mdash;Is this!&mdash;Is this a time&mdash;And again &s;he look'd upon Mr. Solmes.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry, on reflection, that I put my mamma into &s;o much confu&s;ion.&mdash;To be &s;ure it was very &s;aucy in me.</P>
<P>I begg'd pardon. But my papa, I &s;aid, would re|turn. I &s;hould have no other opportunity. I thought it was requi&s;ite, &s;ince I was not permitted to with|draw, that Mr. Solmes's pre&s;ence &s;hould not deprive me of an opportunity of &s;uch importance for me to embrace; and at the &s;ame time, if he &s;till vi&s;ited on my account (looking at him), to &s;hew, that it could not po&s;&s;ibly be to any purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="154">Is the girl mad? &s;aid my mamma, interrupting me.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter, with the affectation of a whi&s;per to my mamma&mdash;This is&mdash;This is <HI>&s;pite,</HI> Madam (very <HI>&s;pite|fully</HI> &s;he &s;poke the word), becau&s;e you commanded her to &s;tay.</P>
<P>I only looked at her, and turning to my mamma, Permit me, Madam, &s;aid I, to repeat my reque&s;t. I have no brother, no &s;i&s;ter!&mdash;If I lo&s;e my mamma's favour, I am lo&s;t for ever!</P>
<P>Mr. Solmes removed to his fir&s;t &s;eat, and fell to gnawing the head of his hazel; a carved head, almo&s;t as ugly as his own. I did not think the man was &s;o <HI>&s;en&s;ible.</HI></P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter ro&s;e, with a face all over &s;carlet, and &s;tep|ping to the table, where lay a fan, &s;he took it up, and, altho' Mr. Solmes had ob&s;erv'd that the weather was cold, fann'd her&s;elf very violently.</P>
<P>My mamma came to me, and angrily taking my hand, led me out of that parlour into my own; which, you know, is next to it&mdash;Is not this behaviour very bold, very provoking, think you, Clary?</P>
<P>I beg your pardon, Madam, if it has that appear|ance to you. But indeed, my dear mamma, there &s;eem to be &s;nares laying for me. Too well I know my brother's drift. With a good word he &s;hall have my con&s;ent for all he wi&s;hes to worm me out of.&mdash;Neither he, nor my &s;i&s;ter, &s;hall need to take half this pains.&mdash;</P>
<P>My mamma was about to leave me in high di&s;|plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>I be&s;ought her to &s;tay: One favour, but one favour, deare&s;t Madam, &s;aid I, give me leave to beg of you&mdash;</P>
<P>What would the girl?</P>
<P>I &s;ee how every thing is working about.&mdash;I never, never can think of Mr. Solmes. My papa will be in tumults, when he is told that I cannot. They will judge of the tenderne&s;s of your heart to a poor child who &s;eems devoted by every-one el&s;e, from the wil|lingne&s;s you have already &s;hewn to hearken to my
<PB N="144" REF="155">
prayers. There will be endeavours u&s;ed to confine me, and keep me out of your pre&s;ence, and out of the pre&s;ence of every one who u&s;ed to love me&mdash;(This, my dear, is threaten'd)&mdash;If This be effected; if it be put out of my power to plead my own cau&s;e, and to appeal to You, and to my uncle Harlowe, of whom only I have hope;&mdash;then will every ear be open'd again&s;t me; and every tale encourag'd.&mdash;It is, there|fore, my humble reque&s;t, That, added to the di&s;|graceful prohibitions I now &s;uffer under, you will not, if you can help it, give way to my being deny'd your ear.</P>
<P>Your li&s;tening Hannah has given you this intelli|gence, as &s;he does many others.</P>
<P>My Hannah, Madam, li&s;tens not!&mdash;My Han|nah&mdash;</P>
<P>No more in her behalf&mdash;She is known to make mi&s;chief&mdash;She is known&mdash;But no more of that bu&s;y intermeddler&mdash;'Tis true, your father threaten'd to confine you to your chamber, if you comply'd not, in order the more a&s;&s;uredly to deprive you of the op|portunity of corre&s;ponding with tho&s;e who harden your heart again&s;t his will. He bid me tell you &s;o, when he went out, if I found you refractory. But I was loth to deliver &s;o har&s;h a declaration; being &s;till in hope that you would come down to us in a compliant tem|per.&mdash;Hannah has overheard this, I &s;uppo&s;e; and has told you of it; as al&s;o, that he declar'd he would break your heart, rather than you &s;hould break his. And I now a&s;&s;ure you, that you will be confin'd, and prohibited making teazing appeals to any of us: And we &s;hall &s;ee who is to &s;ubmit, You, or every-body <HI>to</HI> you!</P>
<P>I offer'd to clear Hannah, and to lay the latter part of the intelligence to my &s;i&s;ter's echo, Betty Barnes, who had boa&s;ted of it to another &s;ervant: But I was again bid to be &s;ilent on that head. I &s;hould &s;oon find, &s;he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that <HI>others</HI> could be as determin'd
<PB N="145" REF="156">
as I was ob&s;tinate: And, once for all, would add, that &s;ince &s;he &s;aw that I built upon her indulgence, and matter'd not involving her in contentions with my father, and his brothers, and her other children, &s;he would now a&s;&s;ure me, that &s;he was as much deter|min'd <HI>again&s;t</HI> Mr. Lovelace, and <HI>for</HI> Mr. Solmes and the family-&s;chemes, as any-body; and would not re|fu&s;e her con&s;ent to any mea&s;ures that &s;hould be thought nece&s;&s;ary to reduce a &s;tubborn child to her duty.</P>
<P>I was ready to &s;ink. She was &s;o good as to lend me her arm to &s;upport me.</P>
<P>And this is all I have to hope for from my mamma?</P>
<P>It is. But, Clary, this one further opportunity I give you&mdash;Go in again to Mr. Solmes, and behave di&s;creetly to him; and let your papa find you toge|ther, upon <HI>civil</HI> terms at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>My feet moved (of them&s;elves, I think) farther from the parlour where he was, and towards the &s;tairs; and there I &s;topp'd and pau&s;ed.</P>
<P>If, proceeded &s;he, you are determin'd to &s;tand in defiance of us all&mdash;then indeed may you go up to your chamber (as you are ready to do)&mdash;And God help you!</P>
<P>God help me indeed! for I cannot give hope of what I cannot intend&mdash;But let me have your prayers, my dear mamma!&mdash;Tho&s;e &s;hall have mine, who have brought me into all this di&s;tre&s;s!</P>
<P>I was moving to go up&mdash;</P>
<P>And <HI>will</HI> you go up, Clary?</P>
<P>I turn'd my face to her: My officious tears would needs plead for me: I could not ju&s;t then &s;peak; and &s;tood &s;till.</P>

<P>HANNAH has ju&s;t brought me, from the private place in the garden-wall, a letter from Mr. Love|lace, depo&s;ited la&s;t night, &s;igned al&s;o by Lord M.</P>
<P>He tells me in it,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That Mr. Solmes makes it his boa&s;t, that he is to be marry'd in a few days to one of the &s;hye&s;t women in England: That my brother explains his meaning to be me; a&s;&s;uring every-one, that his younge&s;t &s;i&s;ter is very &s;oon to be Mr. Solmes's wife. He tells me of the patterns be&s;poke, which my mamma mention'd to me.'</Q></P>
<P>Not one thing e&s;capes him that is done or &s;aid in this hou&s;e!</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'My &s;i&s;ter, he &s;ays, reports the &s;ame things; and that with &s;uch particular aggravations of in&s;ult upon <HI>him,</HI> that he cannot but be extremely piqued, as well at the manner, as from the occa&s;ion; and expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf with great violence upon it.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'He knows not what my relations inducements can be, to prefer &s;uch a man as Solmes to him. If ad|vantageous &s;ettlements be the motive, Solmes &s;hall not offer what he will refu&s;e to comply with.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'As to his e&s;tate, or family; the fir&s;t cannot be excepted again&s;t: And for the &s;econd, he will not di&s;grace him&s;elf by a compari&s;on &s;o odious. He ap|peals to Lord M. for the regularity of his life and manners, ever &s;ince he has made his addre&s;&s;es to me, or had hope of my favour.'</Q></P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, he would have his Lord&s;hip's &s;igning to this letter to be taken as a voucher for him.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'He de&s;ires my leave, in company with my Lord, in a pacific manner, to attend my father or uncles, in order to make propo&s;als that mu&s;t be accepted, if they will but &s;ee him, and hear what they are:
<PB N="148" REF="159">
And tells me, that he will &s;ubmit to any mea|&s;ures that I &s;hall pre&s;cribe, in order to bring about a reconciliation.'</Q></P>
<P>He pre&s;umes to be very earne&s;t with me
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'to give him a private meeting &s;ome night, in my father's garden, attended by whom I plea&s;e.'</Q></P>
<P>Really, my dear, were you to &s;ee his letter, you would think I had given him great encouragement, and were in direct treaty with him; or that he were &s;ure that my friends would drive me into a foreign protection; for he has the boldne&s;s to offer, in my Lord's name, an a&s;ylum to me, &s;hould I be tyranni|cally treated in Solmes's behalf.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e it is the way of this &s;ex to endeavour to intangle the thoughtle&s;s of ours by bold &s;uppo&s;als and offers, in hopes that we &s;hall be too complai&s;ant or ba&s;hful to quarrel with them; and, if not check'd, to reckon upon our &s;ilence, as a&s;&s;ents voluntarily given, or conce&s;&s;ions made in their favour.</P>
<P>There are other particulars in this letter which I ought to mention to you: But I will take an oppor|tunity to &s;end you the letter it&s;elf, or a copy of it.</P>
<P>For my own part, I am very unea&s;y to think how I have been <HI>drawn</HI> on one hand, and <HI>driven</HI> on the other, into a clande&s;tine, in &s;hort, into a mere Lover-like corre&s;pondence, which my heart condemns.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to &s;ee, that if I do not break it off, Mr. Lovelace's advantages, by rea&s;on of my unhappy &s;itu|ation, will every day increa&s;e, and I &s;hall be more and more intangled: Yet if I do put an end to it, without making it a condition of being freed from Mr. Solmes's addre&s;s&mdash;May I, my dear, is it be&s;t, to continue it a little longer, in hopes, by giving him up, to extricate my&s;elf out of the other difficulty?&mdash;Who&s;e advice can I now a&s;k but yours?</P>
<P>All my relations are met. They are at breakfa&s;t together. Solmes is expected. I am exce&s;&s;ively un|ea&s;y. I mu&s;t lay down my pen.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="160">THEY are all going to church together. Grievou&s;ly di&s;order'd they appear to be, as Hannah tells me. She believes &s;omething is re&s;olved upon.</P>

<P>WHAT a cruel thing is &s;u&s;pen&s;e!&mdash;I will a&s;k leave to go to church this afternoon. I expect to be deny'd: But if I do not a&s;k, they may allege, that my not going is owing to my &s;elf.</P>
<P>I de&s;ired to &s;peak with Shorey: Shorey came: I directed her to carry my reque&s;t to my mamma, for permi&s;&s;ion to go to church this afternoon. What think you was the return? Tell her, that &s;he mu&s;t direct her&s;elf to her brother for any favour &s;he has to a&s;k.&mdash;So, my dear, I am to be deliver'd up to my brother!&mdash;</P>
<P>I was re&s;olved, however, to a&s;k of <HI>him</HI> this favour. Accordingly, when they &s;ent me up my &s;olitary din|ner, I gave the me&s;&s;enger a billet, in which I made it my humble reque&s;t to my papa, thro' him, to be per|mitted to go to church this afternoon.</P>
<P>This was the contemptuous an&s;wer: Tell her, that her reque&s;t will be taken into con&s;ideration <HI>to-morrow.</HI>&mdash;My reque&s;t to go to church <HI>to-day</HI> to be taken into con&s;ideration <HI>to-morrow!</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Patience will be the fitte&s;t return I can make to &s;uch an in&s;ult. But this method will not do, indeed it will not, with your Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe. And yet it is but the beginning, I &s;uppo&s;e, of what I am to ex|pect from my brother, now I am delivered up to him.</P>
<P>ON recollection, I thought it be&s;t to renew my re|que&s;t. I did. The following is a copy of what I wrote, and what follows that, of the an&s;wer &s;ent me.

<P>I KNOW not what to make of the an&s;wer brought to my reque&s;t of being permitted to go to church this afternoon. If you de&s;igned to &s;hew your plea|&s;antry by it, I hope that will continue; and then my reque&s;t will be granted.

<P>THEY are re&s;olv'd to break my heart. My poor Hannah is di&s;charged&mdash;di&s;gracefully di&s;charged!&mdash;Thus it was.</P>
<P>Half an hour after I had &s;ent the poor girl down for my breakfa&s;t, that bold creature Betty Barnes, my &s;i&s;ter's confident and &s;ervant (if a favourite maid and confident can be deemed a <HI>&s;ervant</HI>), came up.</P>
<P>What, Mi&s;s, will you plea&s;e to have for breakfa&s;t?</P>
<P>I was &s;urpris'd. What will I have for breakfa&s;t, Betty!&mdash;How!&mdash;What!&mdash;How comes it!&mdash;Then I named Hannah!&mdash;I could not tell what to &s;ay.</P>
<P>Don't be &s;urpris'd, Mi&s;s:&mdash;But you'll &s;ee Hannah no more in this hou&s;e!&mdash;</P>
<P>God forbid!&mdash;Is any harm come to Hannah!&mdash;What! What is the matter with Hannah?&mdash;</P>
<P>Why, Mi&s;s, the &s;hort and the long is this: Your papa and mamma think Hannah has &s;taid long enough in the hou&s;e to do mi&s;chief; and &s;o &s;he is order'd to <HI>troop</HI> (that was the confident creature's word); and I am directed to wait upon you.</P>
<P>I bur&s;t into tears:&mdash;I have no &s;ervice for you, Betty Barnes, none at all.&mdash;But where is Hannah?&mdash;Cannot I &s;peak with the poor girl. I owe her half a year's wages. May I not &s;ee the hone&s;t creature, and pay her her wages?&mdash;I may never &s;ee her again per|haps, for they are re&s;olv'd to break my heart.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="163">And they think, you are re&s;olv'd to break theirs: So tit for tat, Mi&s;s.</P>
<P>Impertinent I call'd her; and a&s;k'd her, if it were upon &s;uch confident terms that her &s;ervice was to commence.</P>
<P>I was &s;o very earne&s;t to &s;ee the poor maid, that, to oblige me, as &s;he &s;aid, &s;he went down with my reque&s;t.</P>
<P>The worthy creature was as earne&s;t to &s;ee me; and the favour was granted in pre&s;ence of Shorey and Betty.</P>
<P>I thank'd her, when &s;he came up, for her pa&s;t &s;ervice to me.</P>
<P>Her heart was ready to break. And &s;he fell a vin|dicating her fidelity and love; and di&s;claiming any mi&s;chief &s;he had ever made.</P>
<P>I told her, that tho&s;e, who occa&s;ion'd her being turn'd out of my &s;ervice, made no que&s;tion of her in|tegrity: That it was an indignity level'd at me: That I was very &s;orry for it, and hoped &s;he would meet with as good a &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Never, never, wringing her hands, a mi&s;tre&s;s &s;he loved &s;o well. And the poor creature ran on in my prai&s;es, and in profe&s;&s;ions of love to me.</P>
<P>We are all apt, you know, my dear, to prai&s;e our benefactors, becau&s;e they <HI>are</HI> our benefactors; as if every-body did right or wrong as they obliged or di&s;|obliged <HI>us.</HI> But this good creature <HI>de&s;erved</HI> to be kindly treated; &s;o I could have no merit in favouring one, whom it would have been ingrateful not to di&s;tingui&s;h.</P>
<P>I gave her a little linen, &s;ome laces, and other odd things; and, in&s;tead of four pounds which were due to her, ten guineas: And &s;aid, If ever I were again allow'd to be my own mi&s;tre&s;s, I would think of <HI>her</HI> in the fir&s;t place.</P>
<P>Betty enviou&s;ly whi&s;per'd Shorey upon it.</P>
<P>Hannah told me, before their faces, having no other
<PB N="153" REF="164">
opportunity, that &s;he had been examin'd about letters <HI>to</HI> me, and <HI>from</HI> me: And that &s;he had given her pockets to Mi&s;s Harlowe, who look'd into them, and put her fingers in her &s;tays; to &s;atisfy her&s;elf that &s;he had not any.</P>
<P>She gave me an account of the number of my phea&s;ants and bantams; and I &s;aid, they &s;hould be my own care twice or thrice a day.</P>
<P>We wept over each other at parting. The girl pray'd for all the family.</P>
<P>To have &s;o good a &s;ervant &s;o di&s;gracefully di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed, is a cutting thing: And I could not help &s;aying, That the&s;e methods might break my heart, but not any other way an&s;wer the end of the authors of my di&s;graces.</P>
<P>Betty, with a very &s;aucy fleer, &s;aid to Shorey, There would be a trial of &s;kill about that, &s;he fancy'd. But I took no notice of it. If this wench thinks I have robbed her young mi&s;tre&s;s of a lover, as you &s;ay &s;he has given out, &s;he may think it a merit in her&s;elf to be impertinent to me.</P>
<P>Thus have I been forced to part with my faithful Hannah. If you can commend the good creature to a place worthy of her, pray do, for my &s;ake.</P>

<P>BY your papa's and mamma's command, I write, expre&s;ly to forbid you to come into their pre|&s;ence,
<PB N="154" REF="165">
or into the garden when they are there: Nor when they are <HI>not</HI> there, but with Betty Barnes to at|tend you, except by particular licence or command.</P>
<P>On their ble&s;&s;ings, you are forbidden likewi&s;e to corre&s;pond with the vile Lovelace; as it is well known you did by means of your &s;ly Hannah: Whence her &s;udden di&s;charge: As was fit.</P>
<P>Neither are you to corre&s;pond with Mi&s;s Howe; who has given her&s;elf high airs of late; and might po&s;&s;ibly help on your corre&s;pondence with that liber|tine. Nor, in &s;hort, with any-body without leave.</P>
<P>You are not to enter into the pre&s;ence of either of your uncles, without their leave fir&s;t obtained. It is in mercy to you, after &s;uch a behaviour to your mamma, that your papa refu&s;es to &s;ee you.</P>
<P>You are not to be &s;een in any apartment of the hou&s;e, you &s;o lately govern'd as you plea&s;ed, unle&s;s you are commanded down.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, are &s;trictly to confine your&s;elf to your chamber, except now and then, in Betty Barnes's &s;ight (as afore&s;aid) you take a morning and evening turn in the garden: And then you are to go directly, and without &s;topping at any apartment in the way, up and down the back-&s;tairs, that the &s;ight of &s;o perver&s;e a young creature may not add to the pain you have given every-body.</P>
<P>The hourly threatenings of your Lovelace, as well as your own unheard-of ob&s;tinacy, will account to you for all this. What a hand has the be&s;t and mo&s;t indulgent of mothers had with you, who &s;o long pleaded for you, and undertook for you; even when others, from the manner of your &s;etting out, de&s;paired of moving you!&mdash;What mu&s;t your perver&s;ene&s;s have been, that <HI>&s;uch</HI> a mother can give you up! She thinks it right &s;o to do: Nor will take you to favour, unle&s;s you make the fir&s;t &s;teps, by a com|pliance with your duty.</P>
<P>As for my&s;elf, whom, perhaps, you think hardly
<PB N="155" REF="166">
of (in very good company, if you do, that is my con&s;olation); I have advi&s;ed, that you may be permit|ted to pur&s;ue your own inclinations [Some people need no greater puni&s;hment than &s;uch a permi&s;&s;ion]; and not to have the hou&s;e incumbered by one who mu&s;t give them the more pain for the nece&s;&s;ity &s;he has laid them under of avoiding the &s;ight of her, altho' in it.</P>
<P>If any thing I have written, appear &s;evere or har&s;h, it is &s;till in your power (but perhaps, will not always be &s;o) to remedy it; and that by a &s;ingle word.</P>

<P>BY my la&s;t depo&s;ite, you'll &s;ee how I am driven, and what a poor pri&s;oner I am: No regard had to my reputation. The whole matter is now before you. Can <HI>&s;uch</HI> mea&s;ures be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;often?&mdash;But
<PB N="156" REF="167">
&s;urely they can only mean to try to frighten me into my brother's views.&mdash;All my hope is, to be able to weather this point till my cou&s;in Morden comes from Florence; and he is expected &s;oon. Yet, if they are determined upon a &s;hort day, I doubt he will not be here time enough to &s;ave me.</P>
<P>It is plain, by my brother's letter, that my mamma has not &s;pared me, in the report &s;he has made of the conferences between her&s;elf and me: Yet &s;he was plea&s;ed to hint to me, that my brother had views which &s;he would have had me try to di&s;appoint.&mdash;But &s;he had engaged to give a <HI>faithful</HI> account of what was to pa&s;s between her&s;elf and me: And it was doubtle&s;s, much more eligible to give up a daughter, than to di&s;oblige a hu&s;band, and every other per&s;on of the family.</P>
<P>They think they have done every-thing by turn|ing away my poor Hannah: But as long as the li|berty of the garden, and my poultry-vi&s;its are allowed me, they will be mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked <HI>Mrs. Betty,</HI> If &s;he had any orders to watch or attend me? or, Whether I were to a&s;k <HI>her</HI> Leave, whenever I &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to walk in the garden, or to go to feed my Bantams?</P>
<P>Lord ble&s;s her! what could I mean by &s;uch a que&s;tion!&mdash;Yet &s;he owned, that &s;he had heard, that I was not to walk in the garden when my papa, mamma, or uncles were there.</P>
<P>However, as it behoved me to be a&s;&s;ured on this head, I went down directly, and &s;taid an hour, with|out que&s;tion or impediment: And yet a good part of the time, I walked under, and in <HI>&s;ight</HI> (as I may &s;ay) of, my brother's Study-window; where both he and my &s;i&s;ter happened to be. And I am &s;ure they &s;aw me, by the loud mirth they affected; by way of in&s;ult, as I &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
<P>So this part of my re&s;traint was doubtle&s;s a &s;tretch of the authority given him. The inforcing of that may perhaps come next. But I hope not.</P>

<P>HAVING acknowleged to you, that I had re|ceived letters from Mr. Lovelace, full of re&s;ent|ment, and that I an&s;wered them purely to prevent further mi&s;chief; and having &s;hew'd you copies of my an&s;wers, which you did not di&s;approve of, altho' you thought fit, after you had read them, to forbid me any further corre&s;pondence with him; I think it my duty to acquaint you, that another letter from him has &s;ince come to my hand, in which he is very earne&s;t with me to permit him to wait on my papa, or you, or my two uncles, in a pacific way, accompanied by Lord M.&mdash;On which I beg your commands.</P>
<P>I own to you, Madam, that had not the prohibition been renew'd, and had not Hannah been &s;o &s;uddenly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed my &s;ervice, I &s;hould have made the le&s;s &s;cruple to have written an an&s;wer, and to have com|manded her to convey it to him with all &s;peed, in order to di&s;&s;uade him from the&s;e vi&s;its, le&s;t any thing &s;hould happen on the occa&s;ion, that my heart akes but to think of.</P>
<P>And here, I cannot but expre&s;s my grief, that I &s;hould have all the puni&s;hment, and all the blame, who, as I have rea&s;on to think, have prevented great mi&s;chief, and have not been the occa&s;ion of any. For, Madam, could <HI>I</HI> be &s;uppo&s;ed to govern the pa&s;|&s;ions of <HI>either</HI> of the gentlemen?&mdash;Over the one in|deed,
<PB N="158" REF="169">
I have had &s;ome little influence, without giving him hitherto any rea&s;on to think he has fa&s;ten'd an obligation upon me for it.&mdash;Over the other, Who, Madam, has any?</P>
<P>I am grieved at heart, to be obliged to lay &s;o great blame at my brother's door, altho' my reputation and my liberty are both to be &s;acrific'd to his re&s;entment and ambition. May not, however, &s;o deep a &s;ufferer be permitted to &s;peak out?</P>
<P>This communication being as voluntarily made, as dutifully intended; I humbly pre&s;ume to hope, that I &s;hall not be required to produce the letter it&s;elf. I can|not either in honour or prudence do that, becau&s;e of the vehemence of his &s;tyle; for having heard [not, I a&s;|&s;ure you, by my means, or thro' Hannah's] of &s;ome part of the har&s;h treatment I have met with; he thinks him&s;elf intitled to place it to his own account, by rea&s;on of &s;peeches thrown out by &s;ome of my relations equally vehement.</P>
<P>If I do <HI>not</HI> an&s;wer him, he will be made de&s;perate, and think him&s;elf ju&s;tified [tho' I &s;hall not think him &s;o] in re&s;enting the treatment he complains of: If I <HI>do,</HI> and if, in compliment to me, he forbears to re&s;ent what he thinks him&s;elf intitled to re&s;ent; be plea&s;ed, Madam, to con&s;ider the obligation he will &s;uppo&s;e he lays me under.</P>
<P>If I were as &s;trongly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in his favour as is &s;uppo&s;ed, I &s;hould not have wi&s;h'd this to be con&s;ider'd by you.&mdash;And permit me, as a &s;till further proof that I am <HI>not</HI> prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, to beg of you to con&s;ider, Whe|ther, upon the whole, the propo&s;al I made of declare|ing for the Single Life (which I will religiou&s;ly ad|here to) is not the be&s;t way, to get rid of his pre|ten&s;ions with honour. To renounce him, and not to be allowed to aver, that I will never be the other man's, will make him conclude (driven as I am driven), that I am determined in that other man's favour.</P>
<P>If this has not its due weight, my brother's &s;trange
<PB N="159" REF="170">
&s;chemes mu&s;t be try'd, and I will re&s;ign my&s;elf to my de&s;tiny, with all the acquie&s;cence that &s;hall be granted to my prayers. And &s;o leaving the whole to your own wi&s;dom, and whether you choo&s;e to con|&s;ult my papa and uncles upon this humble application, or not; or whether I &s;hall be allowed to write an an&s;wer to Mr. Lovelace, or not (and if allow'd &s;o to do, I beg your direction, by whom to &s;end it); I re|main,</P>

<P>I have ju&s;t received an an&s;wer to the inclo&s;ed letter. My mamma, you'll ob&s;erve, has ordered me to burn it: But, as you will have it in your &s;afe keeping, and nobody el&s;e will &s;ee it, her end will be equally an&s;wer'd. It has neither date nor &s;uper&s;cription.

<OPENER><SALUTE>CLARISSA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SAY not all the blame, and all the puni&s;hment, is yours. I am as much blam'd, and as much puni&s;h'd, as you are; yet am more innocent. When your ob&s;tinacy is equal to any other per&s;on's pa&s;&s;ion, blame not your brother. We judg'd right, that Han|nah carry'd on your corre&s;pondencies. Now &s;he is gone, and you cannot write (we <HI>think</HI> you cannot) to Mi&s;s Howe, nor &s;he to you, without our knowlege, one cau&s;e of unea&s;ine&s;s and jealou&s;y is over.</P>
<P>I had no di&s;like to Hannah. I did not tell her &s;o; becau&s;e Somebody was within hearing, when &s;he de|&s;ired to pay her duty to me at going: I gave her a caution, in a rai&s;ed voice, To take care, where-ever &s;he went to live next, if there were any young Ladies, how &s;he made parties, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in clande&s;tine cor|re&s;pondencies:&mdash;But I &s;lid two guineas into her hand.
<PB N="160" REF="171">
Nor was I angry to hear you were <HI>more</HI> bountiful to her&mdash;So much for Hannah.</P>
<P>I don't know what to write, about your an&s;w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing that man of violence. What can you think of it, that &s;uch a family as ours, &s;hould have &s;uch a rod held over it?&mdash;For my part, I have not own'd that I know you <HI>have</HI> corre&s;ponded: By your la&s;t boldne&s;s to me (an a&s;toni&s;hing one it was, to pur&s;ue before Mr. Solmes, the &s;ubject that I was forced to break from above &s;tairs) you may, as far as I know, plead, that you had my countenance for your corre&s;pondence with him; and &s;o add to the unea&s;ine&s;s between your papa and me. You was once all my comfort: You made all my hard&s;hips tolerable:&mdash;But now!&mdash;However, nothing, it is plain, can move you; and I will &s;ay no more on that head: For you are under your papa's di&s;cipline now; and he will neither be pre&s;cribed to, nor intreated.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have been glad to &s;ee the letter you tell me of, as I &s;aw the re&s;t:&mdash;You &s;ay, both honour and prudence forbid you to &s;hew it me!&mdash;O Clari&s;&s;a! what think you of receiving letters that honour and prudence forbid you to &s;hew to a mo|ther!&mdash;But it is not for me to &s;ee it, if you would <HI>choo&s;e</HI> to &s;hew it me. I will not be in your &s;ecret. I will not know that you did corre&s;pond. And, as to an an&s;wer, take your own methods. But let him know it will be the la&s;t you will write. And, if you do write, I won't &s;ee it: So &s;eal it up, if you do, and give it to Shorey, and &s;he&mdash;Yet do not think I give you licence to write!</P>
<P>We will be upon no conditions with him, nor will <HI>you</HI> be allow'd to be upon any. Your papa and uncles would have no patience were he to come. What have <HI>you</HI> to do to oblige him with your refu&s;al of Mr. Solmes?&mdash;Will not That refu&s;al be to give <HI>him</HI> hope? And while he has any, can <HI>we</HI> be ea&s;y or free from his in&s;ults? Were even your brother in <HI>fault,</HI> as
<PB N="161" REF="172">
that fault cannot be conquer'd, is a &s;i&s;ter to carry on a corre&s;pondence that &s;hall endanger her brother? But your papa has given his &s;anction to your brother's di&s;|likes, and they are now your papa's di&s;likes, and my di&s;likes, your uncles and every-body's!&mdash;No matter to <HI>whom</HI> owing.</P>
<P>As to the re&s;t, you have by your ob&s;tinacy put it out of my power to do any-thing for you. Your papa takes upon him&s;elf to be an&s;werable for all con|&s;equences. You mu&s;t not therefore apply to me for any favour. I &s;hall endeavour to be only an ob&s;erver; Happy, if I could be an unconcerned one!&mdash;While I had power, you would not let me u&s;e it as I <HI>would</HI> have u&s;ed it. Your aunt has been forced to engage not to interfere but by your papa's direction. You'll have &s;evere trials. If you have any favour to hope for, it mu&s;t be from the mediation of your uncles. And yet I believe, they are equally determin'd: For they make it a principle&mdash;(Alas! they never had children!) that that child, who in marriage is not go|vern'd by her parents, is to be given up as a lo&s;t crea|ture!</P>
<P>I charge you, let not this letter be found. Burn it. There is too much of the <HI>mother</HI> in it, to a daughter &s;o unaccountably ob&s;tinate.</P>
<P>Write not another letter to me, I can do nothing for you. But you can do every thing for your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Now, my dear, to proceed with my melancholy narrative.</P>
<P>After this letter, you will believe, that I could have very little hopes, that an application directly to my father, would &s;tand me in any &s;tead: But I thought it became me to write, were it but to acquit my&s;elf <HI>to</HI> my&s;elf, that I have left nothing unattempted, that has the lea&s;t likelihood to re&s;tore me to his favour. Accordingly I wrote to the following effect:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I pre&s;ume not, I &s;ay, to argue with my papa, I

only beg his mercy and indulgence in this <HI>one</HI> point, on which depends my pre&s;ent and perhaps my <HI>fu|ture</HI> happine&s;s; and be&s;eech him not to reprobate his child for an aver&s;ion which it is not in her power to conquer. I beg, that I may not be &s;acrific'd to projects, and remote contingencies: I complain of the di&s;graces I &s;uffer in this bani&s;hment from his pre|&s;ence, and in being confined to my chamber. In every thing but this <HI>one</HI> point, I promi&s;e implicit duty and re&s;ignation to his will. I repeat my offers of a Single Life; and appeal to him, whether I have ever given him cau&s;e to doubt my word. I beg to be admitted to his, and to my mamma's pre&s;ence, and that my conduct may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e under their own eye: And this with the more earne&s;tne&s;s, as I have too much rea&s;on to believe, that &s;nares are laid for me; and tauntings and revilings u&s;ed, on purpo&s;e to make a handle of my words again&s;t me, when I am not permitted to &s;peak in my own defence. I conclude with hoping, that my brother's in&s;tigations may not rob an unhappy child of her father.'</Q></P>

<P>I Have another letter from Mr. Lovelace, altho' I had not an&s;wer'd his former.</P>
<P>This man, &s;ome how or other, knows every thing that pa&s;&s;es in our family: My confinement; Hannah's di&s;mi&s;&s;ion; and more of the re&s;entments and re&s;o|lutions of my father, uncles, and brother, than I can po&s;&s;ibly know, and almo&s;t as &s;oon as things happen. He cannot come at the&s;e intelligences fairly.</P>
<P>He is exce&s;&s;ively unea&s;y upon what he hears; and his expre&s;&s;ions both of love to me, and re&s;entment to them, are very fervent. He &s;ollicits me much
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'To engage my honour to him, Never to have Mr.
<PB N="164" REF="175">
Solmes.'</Q>
I think I may fairly promi&s;e him that I will not.</P>
<P>He begs,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That I will not think he is endeavour|ing to make to him&s;elf a <HI>merit</HI> at any man's ex|pence, &s;ince he hopes to obtain my favour on the foot of his <HI>own</HI>; nor that he &s;eeks to <HI>intimidate</HI> me into a con&s;ideration for him. But declares, that the treatment he meets with from my family is &s;o in|tolerable, that he is perpetually reproached for not re&s;enting it; and that as well by Lord M. and his two aunts, as by all his other friends: And if he mu&s;t have no hope from me, he cannot an&s;wer for what his de&s;pair will make him do.'</Q></P>
<P>Indeed, he &s;ays, his relations, the Ladies particu|larly, advi&s;e him to have recour&s;e to a <HI>legal</HI> remedy:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'But how, he a&s;ks, can a man of honour go to law for verbal abu&s;es, given by people intitled to wear &s;words?'</Q></P>
<P>You &s;ee, my dear, that my mamma &s;eems as ap|prehen&s;ive of mi&s;chief as I, and has indirectly of|fer'd to let Shorey carry my an&s;wer to the letter he &s;ent me before.</P>
<P>He is full of the favour of the Ladies of his family to me: To whom, neverthele&s;s, I am per&s;onally a &s;tranger; except, that once I &s;aw Mi&s;s Patty Mon|tague at Mrs. Knollys's.</P>
<P>It is natural, I believe, for a per&s;on to be the more de&s;irous of making new friends, in proportion as &s;he lo&s;es the favour of old ones: Yet, had I rather appear amiable in the eyes of my own relations, and in your eyes, than in tho&s;e of all the world be&s;ides:&mdash;But the&s;e four Ladies of his family have &s;uch excellent cha|racters, that one cannot but wi&s;h to be thought well of by them. Cannot there be a way to find out by Mrs. Forte&s;cue's means, or by Mr. Hickman, who has &s;ome knowlege of Lord M. (covertly, however), what their opinions are of the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of things in our family; and of the little likelihood there
<PB N="165" REF="176">
is, that ever the alliance once approved of by them, can take effect?&mdash;I cannot, for my own part, think &s;o well of my&s;elf, as to imagine, that they can wi&s;h him to per&s;evere in his views with regard to me, through &s;uch contempts and di&s;couragements&mdash;Not that it would concern me, &s;hould they advi&s;e him to the contrary.&mdash;By my Lord's &s;igning Mr. Lovelace's former letter; by Mr. Lovelace's a&s;|&s;urances of the continued favour of all his relations; and by the report of others; I &s;eem to &s;tand &s;till high in their favour: But, methinks, I would be glad to have this confirmed to me, as from them&s;elves, by the lips of an indifferent per&s;on; and the rather, as they are known to put a value upon their alliance, fortunes, and family; and take it ami&s;s, as they have rea&s;on, to be included by <HI>ours</HI> in the contempt thrown upon their kin&s;man.</P>
<P>Curio&s;ity at pre&s;ent is all my motive: Nor will there ever, I hope, be a &s;tronger, notwith&s;tanding your que&s;tionable <HI>throbs:</HI> Even were Mr. Lovelace to be le&s;s exceptionable than he is.</P>
<P>I have an&s;wer'd his letters. If he take me at my word, I &s;hall need to be the le&s;s &s;ollicitous for his relations opinions in my favour: And yet one would be glad to be well thought of by the worthy. This is the &s;ub&s;tance of my letter:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I expre&s;s my &s;urprize at his knowing (and &s;o early) all that pa&s;&s;es here. I a&s;&s;ure him, That were there not &s;uch a man in the world, as him&s;elf, I would not have Mr. Solmes.'</Q></P>
<P>I tell him,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That to return, as I under&s;tand he does, defiances for defiances, to my relations, is far from being a proof with me, either of his politene&s;s, or of the con&s;ideration he pretends to have for me.</Q></P>

this letter (altho' no one has &s;een the contents), provided it &s;hall be the la&s;t I will ever write to him: That I had more than once told him, that the Single Life was my choice: And this, before Mr. Solmes was introduced as a vi&s;itor in our family: That Mr. Wyerley, and other gentlemen, knew it well to be my choice, before <HI>he</HI> was acquainted with any of us: That I had never been induced to receive a line from him on the &s;ubject, but that I thought he had not acted ungenerou&s;ly by my brother; and yet had not been &s;o hand&s;omely treated by my friends, as he might have expected: That had he even my friends of his &s;ide, I &s;hould have very great objections to him, were I to get over my choice of a Single Life, &s;o really preferable to me as it is; and that I &s;hould have declared as much to him, had I reg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rded him as more than a common vi&s;itor. On all the&s;e accounts, I de&s;ire, that the one more letter which I will allow him to depo&s;ite in the u&s;ual place, may be the very <HI>la&s;t</HI>; and That only, to acquaint me with his acquie&s;cence, that it &s;hall be &s;o; at lea&s;t till hap|pier times!'</Q></P>
<P>This la&s;t I put in, that he may not he quite de&s;pe|rate. But if he take me at my word, I &s;hall be rid of one of my tormentors.</P>
<P>I have promi&s;ed to lay before you all his letters, and my an&s;wers: I repeat that promi&s;e: And am the le&s;s &s;ollicitous for that rea&s;on, to amplify upon the contents of either. But I cannot too often ex|pre&s;s my vexation, to be driven to &s;uch &s;treights and difficulties, here at home, as oblige me to an&s;wer letters (from a man I had not ab&s;olutely intended to encourage, and had really great objections to) filled as <HI>his</HI> are with &s;uch warm prote&s;tations, and written to me with a &s;pirit of expectation.</P>
<P>For, my dear, you never knew &s;o bold a &s;uppo&s;er. As commentators find beauties in an author, which the author perhaps was a &s;tranger to; &s;o he &s;ome|times compliments me in high &s;trains of gratitude, for
<PB N="167" REF="180">
favours, and for a con&s;ideration, which I never de|&s;igned him; in&s;omuch that I am frequently under a nece&s;&s;ity of explaining away the attributed goodne&s;s, which if I &s;hew'd him, I &s;hould have the le&s;s opinion of my&s;elf.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, my dear, like a re&s;tiff hor&s;e, he pains one's hands, and half disjoints one's arms, to rein him in. And, when you &s;ee his letters, you mu&s;t form no judgment upon them, till you have read my an&s;wers: If you do, you will indeed think you have cau&s;e to attribute <HI>&s;elf-deceit,</HI> and <HI>throbs,</HI> and <HI>glows</HI> to your friend:&mdash;And yet, at other times, the contradictory creature complains, that I &s;hew him as little favour, and my friends as much inveteracy, as if in the ren|counter betwixt my brother and him, he had been the aggre&s;&s;or; and as if the cata&s;trophe had been as fatal, as it might have been.</P>
<P>If he has a de&s;ign by this conduct (&s;ometimes com|plaining of my &s;hyne&s;s, at others exulting in my ima|ginary favours) to induce me at one time to acquie&s;ce with his compliments, at another to be more com|plai&s;ant for his complaints; and if the contradiction be not the effect of his inattention and giddine&s;s; I &s;hall think him as deep and as artful (too probably, as <HI>practi&s;ed</HI>) a creature, as ever lived; and were I to be &s;ure of it, &s;hould hate him, if po&s;&s;ible, wor&s;e than I do Solmes.</P>

<P>I Have no patience with any of the people you are with. I know not what to advi&s;e you to do. How do you know, that you are not puni&s;hable for
<PB N="168" REF="181">
being the cau&s;e, tho' to your own lo&s;s, that the will of your grandfather is not comply'd with?&mdash;Wills are &s;acred things, child. You &s;ee, that they, even <HI>they,</HI> think &s;o, who imagine they &s;uffer by a will, thro' the di&s;tinction paid you in it.</P>
<P>I allow of all your noble rea&s;onings for what you did at the time: But &s;ince &s;uch a charming, &s;uch a generous in&s;tance of filial duty, is to go thus unre|warded; Why &s;hould you not re&s;ume?</P>
<P>Your grandfather knew the family-failing: He knew what a noble &s;pirit you had to do good.&mdash;He him&s;elf, perhaps (excu&s;e me, my dear), had done too little in his life-time; and therefore he put it in your power to make up for the defects of the whole fa|mily. Were it to me, I would re&s;ume it. Indeed I would.</P>
<P>You will &s;ay, you cannot do it, while you are with them. I don't know that. Do you think they can u&s;e you wor&s;e than they do?&mdash;And is it not your <HI>right?</HI> And do they not make u&s;e of your own genero&s;ity to oppre&s;s you? Your uncle Harlowe is one tru&s;tee, your cou&s;in Morden is the other: In&s;i&s;t upon your right to your uncle; and write to your cou&s;in Morden about it. This, I dare &s;ay, will make them alter their behaviour to you.</P>
<P>Your in&s;olent brother, what has <HI>he</HI> to do to con|troul you?&mdash;Were it me (I wi&s;h it were for one month, and no more), I'd &s;hew him the difference. I'd be in my own man&s;ion, pur&s;uing my charming &s;chemes, and making all around me happy. I'd &s;et up my own chariot. I'd vi&s;it them when they de|&s;erv'd it. But when my brother and &s;i&s;ter gave them&s;elves airs, I'd let them know, that I was their &s;i&s;ter, and not their &s;ervant: And, if that did not do, I would &s;hut my gates again&s;t them; and bid them be company for each other.&mdash;</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, however, that this brother and &s;i&s;ter of yours, judging as &s;uch narrow &s;pirits will
<PB N="169" REF="182">
ever judge, have &s;ome rea&s;on for treating you as they do. It mu&s;t have long been a mortifying con&s;ideration to them (&s;et di&s;appointed love on her &s;ide, and avarice on his, out of the que&s;tion) to be &s;o much eclip&s;ed by a younger &s;i&s;ter.&mdash;Such a &s;un in a family, where there are none but faint twinklers, How could they bear it!&mdash;Why, my dear, they mu&s;t look upon you as a prodigy among them: And prodigies, you know, tho' they obtain our admiration, never attract our love. The di&s;tance between you and them is immen&s;e. Their eyes ake to look up at you. What &s;hades does your full day of merit ca&s;t upon them!&mdash;Can you wonder then, that they &s;hould embrace the fir&s;t opportunity that offer'd, to endeavour to bring you down to their level?</P>
<P>Depend upon it, my dear, you will have more of it, and more &s;till, as you bear it.</P>
<P>As to this odious Solmes, I wonder not at your aver&s;ion to him. It is needle&s;s to &s;ay any thing to you, who have &s;o &s;incere an antipathy to him, to &s;trengthen your di&s;like: Yet, who can re&s;i&s;t her own talents? One of mine, as I have heretofore &s;aid, is to give an ugly likene&s;s. Shall I indulge it?&mdash;I will. And the rather, as, in doing &s;o, you will have my opinion in ju&s;tification of your aver&s;ion to him, and in approbation of a &s;teadine&s;s, that I ever admired, and mu&s;t for ever approve in your temper.</P>
<P>I was twice in this wretch's company. At one of the times your Lovelace was there. I need not mention to you, who have &s;uch a <HI>pretty curio&s;ity,</HI> tho' at pre&s;ent, <HI>only</HI> a curio&s;ity, you know! the un|&s;peakable difference!&mdash;</P>
<P>Lovelace entertain'd the company in his lively gay way, and made every-body laugh at one of his &s;tories. It was before this creature was thought of for you. Solmes laugh'd too. It was, however, <HI>his</HI> laugh: For his fir&s;t three years, at lea&s;t, I imagine, mu&s;t have been one continual fit of crying; and his mu&s;cles have
<PB N="170" REF="183">
never yet been able to recover a ri&s;ible tone. His very &s;mile (you never &s;aw him &s;mile I believe; never at lea&s;t gave him cau&s;e to &s;mile) is &s;o little natural to his features, that it appears in him, as hideous as the <HI>grin</HI> of a man in malice.</P>
<P>I took great notice of him, as I do of all the noble Lords of the creation, in their peculiarities; and was di&s;gu&s;ted, nay, &s;hock'd at him even then. I was glad I remember, on that particular occa&s;ion, to &s;ee his &s;trange features recovering their natural gloomi|ne&s;s; tho' they did this but &s;lowly, as if the mu&s;cles which contributed to his di&s;tortions, had turn'd up|on ru&s;ty &s;prings.</P>
<P>What a dreadful thing mu&s;t even the Love of &s;uch a hu&s;band be! For my part, were I his wife! (&mdash;But what have I done to my&s;elf, to make but &s;uch a &s;up|po&s;ition?) I &s;hould never have comfort but in his ab|&s;ence, or when I was quarreling with him. A &s;ple|netic Lady, who mu&s;t have &s;omebody to find fault with, might indeed be brought to endure &s;uch a wretch: The &s;ight of him would always furni&s;h out the occa&s;ion, and all her &s;ervants, for That rea&s;on, and for <HI>That</HI> only, would have cau&s;e to ble&s;s their ma&s;ter. But how grievous, and apprehen&s;ive a thing mu&s;t it be for his wife, had &s;he the lea&s;t degree of delicacy, to catch her&s;elf in having done &s;omething to oblige him?</P>
<P>So much for his per&s;on: As to the other half of him, he is &s;aid to be an in&s;inuating, creeping mortal to any-body he hopes to be a gainer by: An in&s;olent, over-bearing one, where he has no &s;uch views: And is not this the genuine &s;pirit of meanne&s;s?&mdash;He is reported to be &s;piteful and malicious, even to the whole family of any &s;ingle per&s;on, who has once di&s;|obliged him; and to his own relations mo&s;t of all. I am told, that they are none of them &s;uch wretches as him&s;elf. This may be one rea&s;on, why he is for di&s;inheriting them.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="184">My Kitty, from one of his dome&s;tics, tells me, that his tenants hate him: And that he never had a &s;ervant who &s;poke well of him. Vilely &s;u&s;picious of their wronging him, probably from the badne&s;s of his own heart, he is always changing.</P>
<P>His pockets, they &s;ay, are continually cramm'd with keys: So that when he would treat a gue&s;t (a friend he has not out of your family), he is half as long puzzling <HI>which</HI> is <HI>which,</HI> as his niggardly treat might be concluded in.&mdash;And if it be wine, he always fetches it him&s;elf: Nor has he much trouble in doing &s;o; for he has very few vi&s;itors&mdash;only tho&s;e, whom bu&s;ine&s;s or nece&s;&s;ity brings: For a gentleman who can help it, would rather be benighted, than put up at his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Yet this is the man they have found out, for the &s;ake of con&s;iderations as &s;ordid as tho&s;e he is govern'd by, for a hu&s;band (that is to &s;ay, for a Lord and Ma&s;ter) for Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe!</P>
<P>But perhaps, he may not be quite &s;o mi&s;erable as he is repre&s;ented. Characters extremely good, or ex|tremely bad, are &s;eldom ju&s;tly given. Favour for a per&s;on will exalt the one, as disfavour will &s;ink the other. But your uncle Antony has told my mamma, who objected to his covetou&s;ne&s;s, that it was intended <HI>to tie him</HI> up, as he called it, <HI>to your own terms</HI>; which would be with a hempen, rather than a ma|trimonial cord, I dare &s;ay! But, is not this a plain indication, that even his own recommenders think him a mean creature; and that he mu&s;t be articled with&mdash;perhaps for <HI>nece&s;&s;aries?</HI> But enough, and too much, of &s;uch a mortal as this!&mdash;You mu&s;t not have him, my dear&mdash;That I am clear in&mdash;tho' not &s;o clear, how you will be able to avoid it, except you a&s;&s;ert the independence which your e&s;tate gives you.</P>
<P>HERE my mamma broke in upon me. She
<PB N="172" REF="185">
wanted to &s;ee what I had written. I was &s;illy enough to read Solmes's character to her.</P>
<P>She own'd, that the man was not the mo&s;t de|&s;irable of men; had not the happie&s;t appearance: But what was per&s;on in a man? And I was chidden for &s;etting you again&s;t complying with your father's will. Then follow'd a lecture upon the preference to be given in favour of a man who took care to di&s;|charge all his obligations to the world, and to keep all together, in oppo&s;ition to a &s;pendthrift or profligate: A fruitful &s;ubject, you know, whether any particular per&s;on be meant by it, or not: Why will the&s;e wi&s;e parents, by &s;aying too much again&s;t the per&s;ons they di&s;like, put one upon defending them? Lovelace is not a &s;pendthrift; owes not obligations to the world; tho', I doubt not, profligate enough. Then, putting one upon doing <HI>&s;uch</HI> but common ju&s;tice, we mu&s;t needs be prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, truly!&mdash;And &s;o we are put, per|haps, upon <HI>curio&s;ities</HI> fir&s;t, how &s;uch a one or his friends may think of one;&mdash;And then, but too pro|bably, a di&s;tingui&s;hing preference, or &s;omething that looks like it, comes in.</P>
<P>My mamma charg'd me, at la&s;t, to write that &s;ide over again.&mdash;But excu&s;e me, my good mamma! I would not have the character lo&s;t upon any con&s;ider|ation; &s;ince my vein ran freely into it: And I never wrote to plea&s;e my&s;elf, but I plea&s;ed you. A very good rea&s;on why:&mdash;We have but one mind between us&mdash;Only, that &s;ometimes you are a little too grave, methinks; I, no doubt, a little too flippant in your opinion.</P>
<P>This difference in our tempers, however, is pro|bably the rea&s;on that we love one another <HI>&s;o</HI> well, that, in the words of Norris, no <HI>third love</HI> can come in between: Since each, in the other's eye, having &s;omething ami&s;s, and each loving the other well enough to bear being told of it; and the rather, per|haps, as neither wi&s;hes to mend it; This takes off a
<PB N="173" REF="186">
good deal from that rivalry which might encourage a little, if not a great deal, of that latent &s;pleen, which in time might ri&s;e into envy, and That into ill-will. So, my dear, if This be the ca&s;e, let each keep her fault, and much good may do her with it, &s;ay I: For there is con&s;titution in both to plead for it: And what an hero or heroine mu&s;t he or &s;he be, who can conquer a con&s;titutional fault? Let it be <HI>avarice,</HI> as in &s;ome I <HI>dare not</HI> name: Let it be <HI>gravity,</HI> as in my <HI>be&s;t friend:</HI> Or let it be <HI>flippancy,</HI> as in&mdash;I need not &s;ay whom.</P>
<P>It is proper to acquaint you, that I was obliged to comply with my mamma's <HI>curio&s;ity.</HI>&mdash;My mamma has her &s;hare, her <HI>full</HI> &s;hare, of <HI>curio&s;ity,</HI> my dear&mdash;and to let her &s;ee here and there, &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of your letters.&mdash;</P>
<P>I am broke in upon&mdash;But I will tell you by-and-by, what pa&s;&s;ed between my mamma and me, on this occa&s;ion&mdash;And the rather, as &s;he had her GIRL, her favourite HICKMAN, and your LOVELACE, all at once in her eye.&mdash;</P>

<P>Thus it was:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I cannot but think, Nancy, &s;aid &s;he, after all, that there is a little hard&s;hip in Mi&s;s Harlowe's ca&s;e: And yet, as her mamma &s;ays, it is a grating thing to have a child, who was always noted for her duty in <HI>&s;maller</HI> points, to &s;tand in oppo&s;ition to her pa|rents will, in the <HI>greater</HI>; yea, in the <HI>greate&s;t of all.</HI> And now, to middle the matter between both, it is pity, that the man they in&s;i&s;t upon her accepting has not that &s;ort of merit, which &s;o delicate a mind as Mi&s;s Harlowe's might rea&s;onably expect in a hu&s;|band.&mdash;But then, this man is &s;urely preferable to a libertine: To a libertine too, who has had a duel with her own brother. <HI>Fathers</HI> and <HI>mothers</HI> mu&s;t

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'But you &s;ee, child, proceeded my mamma, what a different behaviour MINE is to YOU. I recom|mend to you one of the &s;obere&s;t, yet polite&s;t, men in England.&mdash;'</Q></P>
<P>I think little of my mamma's <HI>polite&s;t,</HI> my dear.

<P>Yes, indeed! To u&s;e <HI>him</HI> kindly, that he may treat <HI>me</HI> familiarly&mdash;But di&s;tance to the men-wretches is be&s;t&mdash;I &s;ay.</P>

<P>She proceeded to prai&s;e Mr. Lovelace's per&s;on, and his qualifications natural and acquired: But then &s;he would judge as <HI>mothers</HI> will judge, and as <HI>daughters</HI> are very loth to judge:&mdash;But could &s;ay nothing in an|&s;wer to your offer of living &s;ingle; and breaking with him&mdash;if&mdash;if&mdash;(three or four <HI>If's</HI> &s;he made of one good one, If) <HI>that</HI> could be depended on, &s;he &s;aid.</P>

<P>YOU will permit me, my dear, to touch upon a few pa&s;&s;ages in your la&s;t favour, that affect me &s;en&s;ibly.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, you mu&s;t allow me to &s;ay, low as I am in &s;pirits, that I am very angry with you for your reflections on my relations, particularly on my father, and on the memory of my grandfather. Nor, my dear, does your own mamma always e&s;cape the keen edge of your vivacity. One cannot one's <HI>&s;elf</HI> forbear to write or &s;peak freely of tho&s;e we love and

honour; that is to &s;ay, when grief wrings the heart: But it goes again&s;t one to hear any body el&s;e take the &s;ame liberties. Then you have &s;o very &s;trong a man|ner of expre&s;&s;ion, where you take a di&s;ta&s;te, that when pa&s;&s;ion has &s;ub&s;ided, and I come by reflection to &s;ee by <HI>your</HI> &s;everity what I have given occa&s;ion for, I cannot help condemning my&s;elf. Let me then, as matters ari&s;e, make my complaints to you; but be it your part to &s;oothe and &s;often my angry pa&s;&s;ions, by &s;uch advice as nobody better knows how to give: And this the rather, as you know what an influence your advice has upon me.</P>
<P>I cannot help owning, that I am plea&s;ed to have you join with me in opinion of the contempt which Mr. Solmes de&s;erves from me. But yet, permit me to &s;ay, that he is not quite &s;o horrible a creature as you make him: As to his <HI>per&s;on,</HI> I mean; for with regard to his <HI>mind,</HI> by all I have heard, you have done him but ju&s;tice: But you have &s;uch a talent at an ugly likene&s;s, and &s;uch a vivacity, that they &s;ome|times carry you out of veri&s;imilitude. In &s;hort, my dear, I have known you, in more in&s;tances than one, &s;it down re&s;olved to write all that wit, rather than &s;trict ju&s;tice, could &s;ugge&s;t upon the given occa&s;ion. Perhaps it may be thought, that I &s;hould &s;ay the le&s;s on this particular &s;ubject, becau&s;e your di&s;like to him ari&s;es from love to me: But &s;hould it not be our aim to judge of our&s;elves, and of every thing that affects us, as we may rea&s;onably imagine other people would judge of us, and of our actions?</P>
<P>As to the advice you give, to re&s;ume my e&s;tate, I am determin'd not to litigate with my papa, let what will be the con&s;equence to my&s;elf. I may give you, at another time, a more particular an&s;wer to your rea&s;onings on this &s;ubject: But, at pre&s;ent, will only ob&s;erve, that it is my opinion, that Lovelace him&s;elf would hardly think me worth addre&s;&s;ing, were he to know <HI>this</HI> to be my re&s;olution. The&s;e <HI>men,</HI>
<PB N="180" REF="193">
my dear, with all their flatteries, look forward to the PERMANENT. Indeed, it is fit they &s;hould. For Love mu&s;t be a very fooli&s;h thing to look back upon, when it has brought per&s;ons born to affluence into indigence; and laid a generous mind under the hard nece&s;&s;ity of obligation and dependence.</P>
<P>You very ingeniou&s;ly account for the love we bear to one another, from the <HI>difference</HI> in our tempers. I own, I &s;hould not have thought of That. There may po&s;&s;ibly be &s;omething in it: But whether there be, or not, whenever I am cool, and give my&s;elf time to reflect, I will love you the better for the cor|rection you give me, be as &s;evere as you will upon me. Spare me not therefore, my dear friend, when|ever you think me in the lea&s;t faulty. I love your agreeable raillery: You know I always did: Nor, however <HI>over</HI>-&s;erious you think me, did I ever think you <HI>flippant,</HI> as you har&s;hly call it. One of the fir&s;t conditions of our mutual friend&s;hip was, that each &s;hould &s;ay or write to the other whatever was upon her mind, without any offence to be taken: A con|dition, that is indeed an indi&s;pen&s;able in all friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>I knew your mamma would be for implicit obe|dience in a child. I am &s;orry my ca&s;e is &s;o circum|&s;tanced, that I <HI>cannot</HI> comply: As my Mrs. Norton &s;ays, it would be my duty to do &s;o, if I could. You are indeed very happy, that you have nothing but your own agreeable, yet whim&s;ical, humours to con|tend with, in the choice &s;he invites you to make of Mr. Hickman!&mdash;How happy &s;hould I be, to be treated with &s;o much lenity!

<HEAD>LETTER XXIX. Mi&s;s <HI>CLARISSA HARLOWE,</HI> To Mi&s;s <HI>HOWE.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Saturday, March 11.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Have had &s;uch taunting me&s;&s;ages, and &s;uch re|peated avowals of ill-offices, brought me from my brother and &s;i&s;ter, if I do not comply with their wills (delivered, too, with provoking &s;aucine&s;s by Betty Barnes), that I have thought it proper, before I enter'd upon my intended addre&s;s to my uncles, in pur&s;uance of the hint given me in my mamma's letter, to ex|po&s;tulate a little with <HI>them.</HI> But, I have done it in &s;uch a manner, as will give you (if you plea&s;e to take it as you have done &s;ome parts of my former letters) great advantage over me. In &s;hort, you will have more cau&s;e than ever, to declare me far gone in Love, if my rea&s;ons for the change of my &s;tyle, in the&s;e letters, with regard to Mr. Lovelace, do not engage your more favourable opinion.&mdash;For I have thought proper to give them their own way; and, &s;ince they will have it, that I have a preferable regard for Mr. Lovelace, I give them cau&s;e rather to confirm their opinion than doubt it.</P>
<P>The&s;e are my rea&s;ons in brief, for the alteration of my &s;tyle.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, they have grounded their prin|cipal argument for my compliance with their will, upon my acknowlegements that my heart is free; and &s;o &s;uppo&s;ing I give up no preferable per&s;on, my oppo&s;ition has the look of downright ob&s;tinacy in their eyes; and they argue, that, at wor&s;t, my aver|&s;ion to Solmes, is an aver&s;ion that may be ea&s;ily &s;ur|mounted, and <HI>ought</HI> to be &s;urmounted in duty to my father, and for the promotion of family views.</P>
<P>Next, altho' they build upon this argument in or|der to &s;ilence me, they &s;eem not to believe me, but
<PB N="183" REF="196">
treat me as violently, and as di&s;gracefully, as if I were in love with one of my father's footmen:&mdash;So that my conditional willingne&s;s to give up Lovelace, has procur'd me no favour.</P>
<P>In the next place, I cannot but think, that my brother's antipathy to him is far from being well-grounded: His inordinate pa&s;&s;ion for the &s;ex is his crime, that is always rung in my ears; and a very great one it is: But, does my brother recriminate upon him thus, in love to me?&mdash;No&mdash;His whole behaviour &s;hews me, that That is not his motive, and that he thinks me rather in his way, than otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>It is then the call of ju&s;tice, as I may &s;ay, to &s;peak up a little for a man, who, altho' provok'd by my brother, did not do him all the mi&s;chief he could have done him, and which my brother had endeavour'd to do <HI>him.</HI> It might not be ami&s;s therefore, I thought, to alarm them a little with an apprehen&s;ion, that the methods they are taking with me, are the very re|ver&s;e of tho&s;e they &s;hould take to an&s;wer the end they de&s;ign by them: And after all, what is the com|pliment I make Mr. Lovelace, if I <HI>allow</HI> it to be thought, that I do really prefer him to &s;uch a man, as him they terrify me with? Then, my Mi&s;s Howe (concluded I) accu&s;es me of a tamene&s;s, which &s;ub|jects me to in&s;ults from my brother: I will keep that dear friend in my eye; and for <HI>all</HI> the&s;e con&s;iderations, try what a little of <HI>her</HI> &s;pirit will do&mdash;&s;it it ever &s;o aukwardly upon me.</P>
<P>In this way of thinking, I wrote to my brother and &s;i&s;ter. This is my Letter to him.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>TREATED, as I am treated, and, in a great mea&s;ure, if not <HI>wholly,</HI> by your in&s;tigations, brother, you mu&s;t permit me to expo&s;tulate with you upon the occa&s;ion. It is not my <HI>intention</HI> to di&s;plea&s;e you in what I am going to write: And yet I mu&s;t deal freely with you: The occa&s;ion calls for it.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="197">And permit me, in the fir&s;t place, to remind you, That I am your <HI>&s;i&s;ter</HI>; and not your <HI>&s;ervant</HI>; and that, therefore, the bitter revilings and pa&s;&s;ionate lan|guage brought me from you, upon an occa&s;ion, in which you have no rea&s;on to pre&s;cribe to me, are neither worthy of my character to bear, or of yours to offer.</P>
<P>Put the ca&s;e, that I <HI>were</HI> to marry the man you di&s;like, and that he were <HI>not</HI> to make a polite or tender hu&s;band, Is that a rea&s;on for you to be an un|polite and di&s;obliging brother?&mdash;Why mu&s;t <HI>you,</HI> Sir, anticipate my misfortunes, were &s;uch a ca&s;e to happen?&mdash;Let me tell you plainly, that the hu&s;band who could treat me, as a <HI>wife,</HI> wor&s;e than you, of late, have treated me as a <HI>&s;i&s;ter,</HI> mu&s;t be a barbarous man indeed.</P>
<P>A&s;k your&s;elf, I pray you, Sir, If you would thus have treated your &s;i&s;ter Bella, had &s;he thought fit to receive the addre&s;&s;es of the man &s;o much hated by you?&mdash;If not, let me caution you, my brother, not to take your mea&s;ures by what you think <HI>will be</HI> borne, but rather by what <HI>ought</HI> to be offer'd.</P>
<P>How would <HI>you</HI> take it, if you had a brother, who, in a like ca&s;e, were to act by <HI>you,</HI> as you do by <HI>me?</HI> You cannot but remember what a laconic an&s;wer you gave even to my papa, who recommended to you Mi&s;s Nelly D'Oily:&mdash;<HI>You did not like her,</HI> were your words: And that was thought &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t needs think, that I cannot but know to <HI>whom</HI> to attribute my di&s;graces, when I recollect my papa's indulgence to me, in permitting me to decline &s;everal offers; and to <HI>whom,</HI> that a common cau&s;e is endeavoured to be made, in favour of a man who&s;e per&s;on and manners are more exceptionable, than tho&s;e of any of the gentlemen I have been permitted to refu&s;e.</P>
<P>I offer not to compare the two men together: Nor is there, indeed, the lea&s;t compari&s;on to be made be|tween them. All the difference to the one's di&s;|advantage,
<PB N="185" REF="198">
if I did, is but in one point&mdash;Of the greate&s;t importance, indeed&mdash;But to whom of <HI>mo&s;t</HI> importance?&mdash;To <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> &s;urely, were I to encourage his application:&mdash;Of the lea&s;t to <HI>you.</HI> Neverthele&s;s, if you do not, by your &s;trange policies, unite <HI>that man</HI> and <HI>me</HI> as joint-&s;ufferers in one cau&s;e, you &s;hall find me as much re&s;olv'd to renounce him, as I am to re|fu&s;e the other. I have made an overture to this pur|po&s;e: I hope you will not give me rea&s;on to confirm my apprehen&s;ions, that it will be owing to <HI>you,</HI> if it be not accepted.</P>
<P>It is a &s;ad thing, to have it to &s;ay, without being con&s;cious of ever having given you cau&s;e of offence, that I have in <HI>you</HI> a <HI>brother,</HI> but not a <HI>friend.</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps you will not conde&s;cend to enter into the rea&s;ons of your late conduct with a fooli&s;h &s;i&s;ter: But, if <HI>politene&s;s,</HI> if <HI>civility,</HI> be not due to that character, and to my &s;ex, <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> is.</P>
<P>Let me take the liberty further to ob&s;erve, that the principal end of a young gentleman's education at the univer&s;ity, is, to learn him to rea&s;on ju&s;tly, and to &s;ubdue the violence of his pa&s;&s;ions: I hope, brother, that you will not give room for any-body who knows us both, to conclude, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oilette has learned the one more of the latter doctrine, than the univer&s;ity has taught the other. I am truly &s;orry to have cau&s;e to &s;ay, that I have heard it often re|marked, that your uncontrouled pa&s;&s;ions are not a credit to your liberal education.</P>
<P>I hope, Sir, that you will excu&s;e the freedom I have taken with you: You have given me too much rea&s;on for it, and you have taken much greater with me, <HI>without</HI> rea&s;on;&mdash;&s;o, if you are offended, ought to look at the cau&s;e, and not at the effect:&mdash;Then examining your&s;elf, that cau&s;e will cea&s;e, and there will not be any-where a more accompli&s;h'd gentleman than my brother.</P>
<P>Si&s;terly affection, I do a&s;&s;ure you, Sir (unkindly,
<PB N="186" REF="199">
as you have u&s;ed <HI>me</HI>), and not the pertne&s;s which of late you have been &s;o apt to impute to me, is my motive in this hint. Let me invoke your returning kindne&s;s, my <HI>only brother!</HI> And give me cau&s;e, I be|&s;eech you, to call you my <HI>compa&s;&s;ionating friend.</HI> For I am, and ever will be,</P>

<P>I Know, there will be no end of your impertinent &s;cribble, if I don't write to you. I write there|fore: But, without entring into argument with &s;uch a conceited and pert preacher and que&s;tioner, it is, to forbid you to plague me with your quaint non&s;en&s;e. I know not what Wit in a woman is good for, but to make her over-value her&s;elf, and de&s;pi&s;e every|body el&s;e.

<P>IN what, my dear &s;i&s;ter, have I offended you, that in&s;tead of endeavouring to &s;often my father's anger again&s;t me (as I am &s;ure, I &s;hould have done for you, had my unhappy ca&s;e been yours) you &s;hould, in &s;o hard-hearted a manner, join to aggravate not only his di&s;plea&s;ure, but my mamma's again&s;t me. Make but my ca&s;e your own, my dear Bella; and &s;uppo&s;e you were commanded to marry Mr. Lovelace (to whom you are believed to have an antipathy), would you not think it a very grievous injunction?&mdash;Yet cannot your di&s;like to Mr. <HI>Lovelace</HI> be greater than mine is to Mr. <HI>Solmes.</HI> Nor are Love and Hatred voluntary pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>My brother may, perhaps, think it a proof of a <HI>manly</HI> &s;pirit, to be an utter &s;tranger to the gentle pa&s;&s;ions. We have both heard him boa&s;t, that he never loved with di&s;tinction; and, having predomi|nating pa&s;&s;ions, and checked in his fir&s;t attempt, perhaps he never will: It is the le&s;s wonder then, raw from the college, &s;o lately him&s;elf the <HI>tutored,</HI> that he &s;hould &s;et up for a tutor, a pre&s;criber to our gentler &s;ex, who&s;e ta&s;tes and manners are differently formed; For what, according to his account, are colleges, but cla&s;&s;es of tyrants, from the upper &s;tudents over the lower, and from them to the tutor?&mdash;That <HI>he,</HI> with &s;uch <HI>ma&s;culine</HI> pa&s;&s;ions, &s;hould endeavour to controul and bear down an unhappy &s;i&s;ter, in a ca&s;e where his antipathy, and, give me leave to &s;ay, his ambition (once you would have allowed the latter to be his fault), can be gratify'd by &s;o doing, may not be quite &s;o much to be wonder'd at&mdash;But, that a <HI>&s;i&s;ter</HI> &s;hould give up the cau&s;e of a &s;i&s;ter, and join with him to &s;et her father and mother again&s;t her, in a ca&s;e relative to &s;ex; in a ca&s;e that might have been her own&mdash;Indeed, my Bella, this is not pretty in you.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="201">There was a time that Mr. Lovelace was thought reclaimable, and when it was far from being deem'd a cen&s;urable view to hope to bring back to the paths of virtue and honour, a man of his &s;en&s;e and under|&s;tanding.

<P>Shorey was at church; and a principal part of her ob&s;ervation was upon his haughty and proud behaviour, when he turn'd round in the pew where he &s;at, to our family-pew.&mdash;My papa and both my uncles were there; &s;o were my mamma and &s;i&s;ter. My brother happily was not!&mdash;They all came home in di&s;order. Nor did the congregation mind any-body but him; it being his fir&s;t appearance there, &s;ince the unhappy rencounter.</P>
<P>What did the man come for, if he intended to look challenge and defiance, as Shorey &s;ays he did, and as others ob&s;erved it &s;eems as well as &s;he? Did he come for <HI>my</HI> &s;ake; and, by behaving in &s;uch a man|ner
<PB N="191" REF="204">
to tho&s;e pre&s;ent of my family, imagine he was do|ing me either &s;ervice o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> plea&s;ure?&mdash;He knows how they hate him: Nor will he take pains, would pains do, to obviate their hatred.</P>
<P>You and I, my dear, have often taken notice of his pride; and you have rallied him upon it; and in|&s;tead of exculpating him&s;elf, he has own'd it; and, by owning it, has thought he has done enough.</P>
<P>For my own part, I thought pride, in his ca&s;e, an improper &s;ubject for raillery.&mdash;People of birth and fortune to be proud, is &s;o needle&s;s, &s;o mean a vice!&mdash;If they <HI>de&s;erve</HI> re&s;pect, they will have it, without re|quiring it. In other words, for per&s;ons to endeavour to gain re&s;pect by a haughty behaviour, is to give a proof that they mi&s;tru&s;t their own merit: To make confe&s;&s;ion that they <HI>know</HI> that their <HI>actions</HI> will not attract it.&mdash;Di&s;tinction or Quality may be prided in by tho&s;e to whom di&s;tinction or quality is a <HI>new</HI> thing. And then the reflection and contempt which &s;uch bring upon them&s;elves, by it, is a counter-balance.</P>
<P>Such added advantages too, as this man has in his per&s;on and mien; learned al&s;o, as they &s;ay he is;&mdash;<HI>Such</HI> a man to be haughty, to be imperious!&mdash;The lines of his own face at the &s;ame time condemning him&mdash;How wholly inexcu&s;able!&mdash;Proud of what? Not of doing well: The only <HI>ju&s;tifiable</HI> pride.&mdash;Proud of <HI>exterior</HI> advantages!&mdash;Mu&s;t not one be led by &s;uch a <HI>&s;top-&s;hort</HI> pride, as one may call it, in him or her who has it, to mi&s;tru&s;t the <HI>interior.</HI> Some people may indeed be afraid, that if they did not a&s;|&s;ume, they would be trampled upon. A very narrow fear, however, &s;ince they trample upon them&s;elves who can fear <HI>this.</HI> But this man mu&s;t be &s;ecure, that humility would be an ornament to him.</P>
<P>He has talents, indeed: But tho&s;e talents, and his per&s;onal advantages, have been &s;nares to him. It is plain they have. And this &s;hews, that, weigh'd in an equal balance, he would be found greatly wanting.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="205">Had my friends confided, as they did at fir&s;t, in that di&s;cretion which they do not accu&s;e me of being defective in, I dare &s;ay I &s;hould have found him out: And then &s;hould have been as re&s;olute to di&s;mi&s;s <HI>him,</HI> as I was to di&s;mi&s;s others, and as I <HI>am</HI> never to have Mr. Solmes. O that they did but know my heart!&mdash;It &s;hall &s;ooner bur&s;t, than voluntarily, uncompelled, undriven, dictate a mea&s;ure that &s;hall ca&s;t a &s;lur either upon them, my &s;ex, or my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Excu&s;e me, my dear friend, for the&s;e grave <HI>&s;olilo|quies,</HI> as I may call them. How have I run from reflection to reflection! But the occa&s;ion is recent!&mdash;They are all in commotion below upon it!</P>
<P>Shorey &s;ays, that he watched my mamma's eye, and bowed to her: And &s;he return'd the compliment. He always admir'd my mamma. She would not, I be|lieve, have hated <HI>him,</HI> had &s;he not been <HI>bid</HI> to hate him; and had it not been for the rencounter between him and her only &s;on.</P>
<P>Dr. Lewin was at church; and ob&s;erving, as every|one el&s;e did, the di&s;order into which Mr. Lovelace's appearance had put all our family, was &s;o good as to engage him in conver&s;ation, when the &s;ervice was over, till they were all gone to their coaches.</P>
<P>My father it &s;eems is more and more incen&s;ed again&s;t me. And &s;o are my uncles: They had my letters in the morning. Their an&s;wers, if they vouch|&s;afe to an&s;wer me, will demon&s;trate, I doubt not, the un&s;ea&s;onablene&s;s of this ra&s;h man's pre&s;ence at our church.</P>
<P>They are angry, it &s;eems, at my mamma, for re|turning his compliment. What an enemy is hatred, even to the common forms of civility! which, how|ever, more di&s;tingui&s;h the <HI>payer</HI> of a compliment, than the <HI>receiver.</HI> But they all &s;ee, they &s;ay, that there is but one way to put an end to his in&s;ults. So I &s;hall &s;uffer: And in what will the ra&s;h man have benefited him&s;elf, or mended his pro&s;pects?</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="206">I am extremely apprehen&s;ive, that this wor&s;e than gho&s;t-like appearance of his, bodes &s;ome &s;till bolder &s;tep. If he come hither (and very de&s;irous he is of my leave to come), I am afraid there will be murder. To avoid That, if there were no other way, I would mo&s;t willingly be bury'd alive.</P>
<P>They are all in con&s;ultation: Upon my letters, I &s;uppo&s;e: So they were in the morning, which occa|&s;ion'd my uncles to be at <HI>our</HI> church. I will &s;end you the copies of tho&s;e letters, as I promi&s;ed in my la&s;t, when I &s;ee whether I can give you their an&s;wers with them. This letter is all&mdash;I-cannot-tell-what&mdash;the effect of apprehen&s;ion and di&s;plea&s;ure at the man who has occa&s;ioned the&s;e apprehen&s;ions: Six lines would have contained all that is in it to the purpo&s;e of my &s;tory.</P>

<P>IN vain do&s;t <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The&s;e gentlemen affected the Roman &s;tyle, as they called it, in their letters: And it was an agreed rule with them, to take in good part whatever freedoms they treated each other with, if the pa&s;&s;ages were written in that &s;tyle.</NOTE> thou and thy compeers pre&s;s me to go to town, while I am in &s;uch an uncertainty as I am at pre&s;ent with this proud Beauty. All the ground I have hitherto gained with her, is intirely owing to her concern for the &s;afety of people whom I have rea&s;on to hate.</P>
<P>Write then, thou bidde&s;t me, if I will not come. That, indeed, I can do; and as well without a &s;ub|ject,
<PB N="194" REF="207">
as with one. And what follows &s;hall be a proof of it.</P>
<P>The Lady's malevolent brother has now, as I told thee at M. Hall, introduced another man; the mo&s;t unpromi&s;ing in his per&s;on and qualities, the mo&s;t for|midable in his offers, that has yet appeared.</P>
<P>This man has, by his propo&s;als, captivated every &s;oul of the Harlowe's&mdash;<HI>Soul!</HI> did I &s;ay?&mdash;There is not a &s;oul among them but my charmer's: And &s;he, with&s;tanding them All, is actually confin'd, and otherwi&s;e maltreated, by a Father the mo&s;t gloomy and po&s;itive; at the in&s;tigation of a Brother the mo&s;t arro|gant and &s;elfi&s;h&mdash;But thou knowe&s;t their characters; and I will not therefore &s;ully my paper with them.</P>
<P>But is it not a confounded thing to be in love with one, who is the daughter, the &s;i&s;ter, the niece, of a family I mu&s;t eternally de&s;pi&s;e? And the devil of it, That Love increa&s;ing, with her&mdash;What &s;hall I call it?&mdash;'Tis not &s;corn:&mdash;'Tis not pride:&mdash;'Tis not the in&s;olence of an adored beauty:&mdash;But 'tis to <HI>virtue,</HI> it &s;eems, that my difficulties are owing: And I pay for not being a &s;ly &s;inner, an hypocrite: for being re|gardle&s;s of my reputation; for permitting &s;lander to open its mouth again&s;t me. But is it nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch a one as I, who have been u&s;ed to carry all before me, upon my own terms&mdash;I, who never in&s;pir'd a Fear, that had not a di&s;cernibly-predominant mixture of Love in it; to be an hypocrite?&mdash;Well &s;ays the poet:
<Q><L>He who &s;eems virtuous does but act a part;</L>
<L>And &s;hews not his own nature, but his art.</L></Q></P>
<P>Well, but, it &s;eems, I mu&s;t <HI>practi&s;e</HI> for This art, if I would &s;ucceed with this truly admirable creature! But why <HI>practi&s;e</HI> for it?&mdash;Cannot I <HI>indeed</HI> reform?&mdash;I have but <HI>one</HI> vice;&mdash;Have I, Jack?&mdash;Thou knowe&s;t my heart, if any man living does. As far as I know it my&s;elf, thou knowe&s;t it.&mdash;But 'tis a cur&s;ed de|ceiver&mdash;For it has many and many a time impo&s;ed
<PB N="195" REF="208">
upon its ma&s;ter&mdash;<HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> did I &s;ay? That am I not now: Nor have I been, from the moment I beheld this angel of a woman: Prepared indeed as I was by her character, before I &s;aw her: For what a mind mu&s;t that be, which, tho' not virtuous it&s;elf, admires not virtue in another?&mdash;My vi&s;it to Arabella, owing to a mi&s;take of the &s;i&s;ters, into which, as thou ha&s;t heard me &s;ay, I was led by the blundering uncle; who was to introduce me (but lately come from abroad) to the <HI>divinity,</HI> as I thought; but, in&s;tead of her, carry'd me to a <HI>mere mortal.</HI> And much diffi|culty had I, &s;o fond and &s;o forward my Lady, to get off, without forfeiting All with a family that I intended &s;hould give me a godde&s;s.</P>
<P>I have boa&s;ted, that I was once in love before:&mdash;And indeed I thought I was. It was in my early man|hood&mdash;with that Quality-jilt, who&s;e infidelity I have vow'd to revenge upon as many of the &s;ex as &s;hall come into my power. I believe, in different climes, I have already &s;acrificed an hecatomb to my Neme&s;is, in pur&s;uance of this vow. But upon recollecting what I was <HI>then,</HI> and comparing it with what I find in my&s;elf <HI>now,</HI> I cannot &s;ay, that I was ever in love before.</P>
<P>What was it then, do&s;t thou a&s;k me, &s;ince the di&s;|appointment had &s;uch effects upon me, when I found my&s;elf jilted, that I was hardly kept in my &s;en&s;es?&mdash;Why I'll tell thee what, as near as I can remember; for it was a great while ago:&mdash;It was&mdash;egad, Jack, I can hardly tell what it was&mdash;But a vehement a&s;pi|ration after a novelty, I think&mdash;Tho&s;e confounded Poets, with their cele&s;tially-terrene de&s;criptions, did as much with me as the Lady: They fired my imagina|tion, and &s;et me upon a de&s;ire to become a godde&s;s-maker. I mu&s;t needs try my new-fledg'd pinions, in &s;onnet, elogy, and madrigal. I mu&s;t have a Cynthia, a Stella, a Sachari&s;&s;a, as well as the be&s;t of them: Darts, and flames, and the devil knows what, mu&s;t I
<PB N="196" REF="209">
give to my Cupid. I mu&s;t create beauty, and place it where nobody el&s;e could find it: And many a time have I been at a lo&s;s for a &s;ubject, when my new-created godde&s;s has been kinder than it was proper for my plaintive &s;onnet &s;he &s;hould be.</P>
<P>Then I had a vanity of <HI>another</HI> &s;ort in my pa&s;&s;ion: I found my&s;elf well-received among the women in ge|neral; and I thought it a pretty <HI>lady-like</HI> tyranny (I was very young then, and very vain) to &s;ingle out &s;ome <HI>one</HI> of the &s;ex, to make <HI>half a &s;core</HI> jealous. And I can tell thee, it had its effect: For many an eye have I made to &s;parkle with rival indignation: Many a cheek glow; and even many a fan have I cau&s;ed to be &s;napped at a &s;i&s;ter-beauty; accompany'd with a reflection, perhaps, at being &s;een alone with a wild young fellow, who could not be in private with both at once.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, Jack, it was more Pride than Love, as I now find it, that put me upon making &s;uch a con|founded rout about lo&s;ing this noble var<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ete&s;s. I thought &s;he loved me at lea&s;t as well as I believed I loved her: Nay, I had the vanity to &s;uppo&s;e &s;he could not help it. My friends were plea&s;ed with my choice. They wanted me to be &s;hackled. For early did they doubt my morals, as to the &s;ex. They &s;aw, that the dancing, the &s;inging, the mu&s;ical Ladies were all fond of my company: For who (I am in a humour to be vain, I think!&mdash;for who) danc'd, who &s;ung, who touch'd the &s;tring, whatever the in&s;trument, with a better grace than thy friend?</P>
<P>I have no notion of playing the hypocrite &s;o egre|giou&s;ly, as to pretend to be blind to qualifications which every-one &s;ees and acknowleges. Such prai&s;e-begging hypocri&s;y! Such affectedly-di&s;claim'd attri|butes! Such contemptible <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rai&s;e-traps!&mdash;But yet, &s;hall my vanity extend only to <HI>per&s;onals,</HI> &s;uch as the gracefulne&s;s of dre&s;s, my debonnaire, and my a&s;&s;ure|ance?&mdash;Self-taught, &s;elf-acquired, the&s;e!&mdash;For my
<PB N="197" REF="210">
PARTS, I value not my&s;elf upon <HI>them.</HI> Thou wilt &s;ay, I have no cau&s;e.&mdash;Perhaps not: But if I had any thing valuable as to intellectuals, tho&s;e are not my own: And to be proud of what a man is an&s;werable for the abu&s;e of, and has no merit in the right u&s;e of, is to &s;trut, like the jay, in a borrowed plumage.</P>
<P>But to return to my fair jilt&mdash;I could not bear, that a woman, who was the fir&s;t that had bound me in &s;ilken fetters (they were not iron ones, like tho&s;e I now wear) &s;hould prefer a'coronet to me: And when the bird was flown, I &s;et more value upon it, than when I had it &s;afe in my cage, and could vi&s;it it when I would.</P>
<P>But now am I in-<HI>deed</HI> in love. I can think of no|thing, of no-body el&s;e, but the divine Clari&s;&s;a Har|lowe.&mdash;<HI>Harlowe!</HI>&mdash;How that hated word &s;ticks in my throat&mdash;But I &s;hall give her for it, the name of Love <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Lovelace.</NOTE>.</P>
<Q><L><HI>CLARISSA!</HI>&mdash;O there's mu&s;ic in the name,</L>
<L>That &s;oft'ning me to infant tenderne&s;s,</L>
<L>Makes my heart &s;pring like the fir&s;t leaps of life!</L></Q>
<P>But could'&s;t thou have thought that I, who think it po&s;&s;ible for me to favour as much as I can be favoured; that I, who for this charming creature think of fore|going the <HI>life of honour</HI> for the <HI>life of &s;hackles</HI>; could adopt tho&s;e over-tender lines of Otway?</P>
<P>I check my&s;elf, and l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aving the three fir&s;t lines of the following of Dryden's to the family of the whiners, find the workings of the pa&s;&s;ion in my &s;tormy &s;oul better expre&s;&s;ed by the three la&s;t:
<Q><LG>
<L>Love various minds does variou&s;ly in&s;pire;</L>
<L>He &s;tirs in gentle natures gentle fire:</L>
<L>Like that of incen&s;e on the altar laid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But raging flames tempe&s;tuous &s;ouls invade:</L>
<L>A fire, which ev'ry windy pa&s;&s;ion blows;</L>
<L>With pride it mounts, and with revenge it glows.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="211">And with REVENGE it <HI>&s;hall</HI> glow!&mdash;For, do&s;t thou think, that if it were not from the hope, That this &s;tupid family are all combin'd to do my work for me, I would bear their in&s;ults?&mdash;Is it po&s;&s;ible to imagine, that I would be brav'd as I am brav'd, threaten'd as I am threaten'd, by tho&s;e who are afraid to &s;ee me; and by this brutal brother too, to whom I gave a life (A life, indeed, not worth my taking!); had I not a greater pride in knowing, that by means of his very Spy upon me, I am playing him off as I plea&s;e; cooling, or inflaming, his violent pa&s;&s;ions, as may be&s;t &s;uit my purpo&s;es; permitting &s;o much to be reveal'd of my life and actions, and intentions, as may give him &s;uch a confidence in his double-fac'd agent, as &s;hall enable me to dance his employer upon my own wires?</P>
<P>This it is, that makes my pride mount above my re&s;entment. By this engine, who&s;e &s;prings I am con|tinually oiling, I play them all off. The bu&s;y old tarpaulin uncle I make but my emba&s;&s;ador to Queen Annabella Howe, to engage her (for example &s;ake to her Prince&s;sly daughter) to join in their cau&s;e, and to a&s;&s;ert an authority they are re&s;olv'd, right or wrong (or I could do nothing), to maintain.</P>
<P>And what my motive, do&s;t thou a&s;k? No le&s;s than this, That my beloved &s;hall find no protection out of my family; for, if I know <HI>hers,</HI> fly &s;he mu&s;t, or have the man &s;he hates. This, therefore, if I take my mea&s;ures right, and my Familiar fail me not, will &s;e|cure her mine, in &s;pight of them all; in &s;pight of her own inflexible heart: Mine, without condition; without reformation-promi&s;es; without the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;iege of years, perhaps; and to be even then, after wearing the gui&s;e of a merit-doubting hypocri&s;y, at an uncertainty, upon a probation unapproved of&mdash;Then &s;hall I have all the ra&s;cals, and ra&s;cale&s;&s;es of the family come creeping to me: I pre&s;cribing to
<PB N="199" REF="212">
them; and bringing that &s;ordidly-imperious brother to kneel at the foot-&s;tool of my throne.</P>
<P>All my fear ari&s;es from the little hold I have in the heart of this charming fro&s;t-piece: Such a con&s;tant glow upon her lovely features: Eyes &s;o &s;parkling: Limbs &s;o divinely turn'd: Health &s;o florid: Youth &s;o blooming: Air &s;o animated: To have an heart &s;o im|penetrable&mdash;And <HI>I,</HI> the hitherto &s;ucce&s;sful Lovelace, the addre&s;&s;or&mdash;How can it be?&mdash;Yet there are people, and I have talk'd with &s;ome of them, who remember, that &s;he was <HI>born:</HI>&mdash;Her nur&s;e Norton boa&s;ts of her maternal offices in her earlie&s;t infancy; and in her education <HI>gradatim.</HI>&mdash;So that there is full proof, that &s;he came not from above, all at once an angel! How then can &s;he be &s;o impenetrable?</P>
<P>But here's her mi&s;take; nor will &s;he be cured of it&mdash;She takes the man &s;he calls her father (her mo|ther had been faultle&s;s, had &s;he not been her father's wife); &s;he takes the men &s;he calls her uncles; the fellow &s;he calls her brother; and the poor con|temptible &s;he calls her &s;i&s;ter; to <HI>be</HI> her father, to <HI>be</HI> her uncles, her brother, her &s;i&s;ter; and that, as &s;uch, &s;he owes to &s;ome of them reverence, to others re|&s;pect, let them treat her ever &s;o cruelly!&mdash;Sordid ties! Mere cradle-prejudices!&mdash;For had they not been impo&s;ed upon her by Nature, when &s;he was in a perver&s;e humour, or could &s;he have cho&s;en her re|lations, Would any of the&s;e have been among them?</P>
<P>How my heart ri&s;es at her preference of them to me, when &s;he is convinc'd of their inju&s;tice to me! Convinc'd that the alliance would do honour to them all&mdash;her&s;elf excepted; to whom every-one owes ho|nour; and from whom the mo&s;t princely family might receive it. But how much more will my heart ri&s;e with indignation again&s;t her, if I find &s;he he&s;itates but one moment (however per&s;ecuted) about pre|ferring me to the man &s;he avowedly hates! But &s;he cannot &s;urely be &s;o mean, as to purcha&s;e her peace
<PB N="200" REF="213">
with them at &s;o dear a rate. She cannot give a &s;anction to projects form'd in malice, and founded in a &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s (and that at her own expence) which &s;he has &s;pirit enough to de&s;pi&s;e in others; and ought to di&s;avow, that we may not think her a Harlowe.</P>
<P>By this incoherent ramble thou wilt gather, that I am not likely to come up in ha&s;te; &s;ince I mu&s;t en|deavour fir&s;t to obtain &s;ome a&s;&s;urance from the be|loved of my &s;oul, that I &s;hall not be &s;acrific'd to &s;uch a wretch as Solmes!

<P>That her indifference to me is not owing to the &s;uperior liking &s;he has for <HI>any</HI> other man, is what rivets my chains: But take care, fair-one; take care, O thou mo&s;t exalted of female minds, and lovelie&s;t of per&s;ons, how thou deba&s;e&s;t thy&s;elf, by encourage|ing &s;uch a competition as thy &s;ordid relations have &s;et on foot in mere malice to me!&mdash;Thou wilt &s;ay I rave.

<P>And yet, why &s;ay I, I am half a&s;ham'd?&mdash;Is it not a glory to love <HI>her</HI> whom every-one who &s;ees her, either loves, or reveres, or both? Dryden &s;ays,
<Q><L>The cau&s;e of Love can never be a&s;&s;ign'd,</L>
<L>'Tis in no face;&mdash;But in the lover's mind.</L></Q></P>
<P>And Cowley thus addre&s;&s;es Beauty as a mere ima|ginary:
<Q><L>Beauty! thou wild fanta&s;tic ape,</L>
<L>Who do&s;t in ev'ry country change thy &s;hape:</L>
<L>Here black; there brown; here tawny; and there white;</L>
<L>Thou flatterer! who comply'&s;t with every &s;ight!</L>
<L>Who ha&s;t no certain What, nor Where.</L></Q>
But both the&s;e, had they been her cotemporaries, and known her, would have confe&s;s'd them&s;elves mi&s;taken: And, taking together per&s;on, mind, and behaviour, would have acknowleg'd the <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> of the univer&s;al voice in her favour.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Full many a Lady</L>
<L>I've ey'd with be&s;t regard; and many a time</L>
<L>Th' harmony of their tongues hath into bondage</L>
<L>Brought my too diligent ear. For <HI>&s;everal</HI> virtues</L>
<L>Have I lik'd <HI>&s;everal</HI> women. Never any</L>
<L>With &s;o full &s;oul, but &s;ome defect in her</L>
<L>Did quarrel with the noble&s;t grace &s;he ow'd,</L>

<P>Thou art curious to know, If I have not &s;tarted a new game?&mdash;If it be po&s;&s;ible for &s;o univer&s;al a lover to be confined &s;o long to one object? Thou knowe&s;t nothing of this charming creature, that thou can&s;t put &s;uch que&s;tions to me; or thinke&s;t thou know'&s;t me better than thou do&s;t.

<P>BY the advices I have this moment received, I have rea&s;on to think, that I &s;hall have occa&s;ion for thee here. Hold thy&s;elf in readine&s;s to come down upon the fir&s;t &s;ummons.</P>
<P>Let Belton, and Mowbray, and Tourville, like|wi&s;e prepare them&s;elves. I have a great mind to contrive a method to &s;end James Harlowe to travel for improvement. Never was there Booby-'Squire that more wanted it. <HI>Contrive</HI> it, did I &s;ay? I have <HI>already</HI> contriv'd it; could I but put it in execution without being &s;u&s;pected to have a hand in it.

<P><PB N="203" REF="216">But be This as it may, there is a pre&s;ent likeli|hood of room for glorious mi&s;chief.

<P>The reinforced orders for this ho&s;tile apparatus are owing, it &s;eems, to a vi&s;it I made ye&s;terday to their church; a good place to begin a reconciliation in, were the heads of the family chri&s;tians, and did they mean any thing by their prayers. My hopes were to have an invitation (or, at lea&s;t, to gain a pretence) to accompany home the gloomy &s;ire; and &s;o get an opportunity to &s;ee my godde&s;s: For, I believed they dur&s;t not but be <HI>civil</HI> to me, at lea&s;t.

Yet not a hair of any of their &s;tupid heads do I intend to hurt.</P>
<P>You &s;hall all have your directions in writing, if there be occa&s;ion. But, after all, I dare &s;ay there will be no need but to &s;hew your faces in my company.</P>
<P>Such faces never could four men &s;hew&mdash;Mow|bray's &s;o fierce and &s;o fighting: Belton's &s;o pert and &s;o pimply: Tourville's &s;o fair and &s;o foppi&s;h: Thine &s;o rough and &s;o re&s;olute: And <HI>I</HI> your leader!&mdash;What hearts, altho' meditating ho&s;tility, mu&s;t tho&s;e be which we &s;hall not appall?&mdash;Each man occa|&s;ionally attended by a &s;ervant or two, long ago cho&s;en for qualities re&s;embling his ma&s;ter's.</P>

<P>ALLOW me, my honoured Second Papa, as in my happy days you taught me to call you, to implore your intere&s;t with my papa, to engage him to di&s;pen&s;e with a command, which, if in&s;i&s;ted upon, will deprive me of my free-will, and make me mi&s;er|able for my whole life.</P>
<P>For my <HI>whole life!</HI> let me repeat: Is that a &s;mall point, my dear uncle, to give up? Am not <HI>I</HI> to live with the man? Is any-body el&s;e? Shall I not there|fore be allow'd to judge for my&s;elf, whether I <HI>can,</HI> or can-<HI>not</HI> live <HI>happily,</HI> with him?</P>
<P>Should it be ever &s;o <HI>un</HI>-happily, will it be prudence to complain, or appeal? If it were, to whom could I appeal with effect again&s;t a hu&s;band? And would
<PB N="205" REF="218">
not the invincible and avow'd di&s;like I have for him at <HI>&s;etting out,</HI> ju&s;tify, as it might &s;eem, any ill u&s;age from him, <HI>in that &s;tate</HI>; were I to be ever &s;o ob&s;er|vant of him? And if I were to be <HI>at all &s;o,</HI> it mu&s;t be from Fear, not Love.&mdash;</P>
<P>Once more, let me repeat, That this is not a <HI>&s;mall</HI> point to give up: And that it is <HI>for life.</HI> Why, I pray you, good Sir, &s;hould I be made mi&s;erable for <HI>life?</HI> Why &s;hould I be deprived of all comfort, but that which the hope, that it would be a very &s;hort one, would afford me?</P>
<P>Marriage is a very &s;olemn engagement, enough to make a young creature's heart ake, with the <HI>be&s;t</HI> pro|&s;pects, when &s;he thinks &s;eriou&s;ly of it!&mdash;To be given up to a &s;trange man; To be ingrafted into a &s;trange family; To give up her very name, as a mark of her becoming his ab&s;olute and dependent property: To be obliged to prefer this &s;trange man, to father, mother,&mdash;to every body:&mdash;And his hu|mours to all her own&mdash;Or to contend, perhaps, in breach of a vow'd duty, for every innocent in&s;tance of free-will: To go no whither: To make acquain|tance: To give up acquaintance:&mdash;To renounce even the &s;tricte&s;t friend&s;hips perhaps; all at his plea|&s;ure, whether &s;he think it rea&s;onable to do &s;o or not:&mdash;Surely, Sir, a young creature ought not to be obliged to make all the&s;e &s;acrifices, but for &s;uch a man as &s;he can approve.&mdash;If &s;he <HI>is,</HI> how &s;ad mu&s;t be the ca&s;e!&mdash;How mi&s;erable the life, if to be called <HI>life!</HI></P>
<P>I wi&s;h I could obey you all. What a plea&s;ure would it be to me, if I could! <HI>Marry fir&s;t, and Love will come after,</HI> was &s;aid by one of my deare&s;t friends! But, 'tis a &s;hocking a&s;&s;ertion! A thou&s;and things may happen to make that &s;tate but barely tolerable, where it is entered into with mutual affection: What mu&s;t it then be, where the hu&s;band can have no con|fidence in the love of his wife; but has rea&s;on rather
<PB N="206" REF="219">
to que&s;tion it, from the preference he <HI>him&s;elf</HI> believes &s;he would have given to &s;omebody el&s;e, had &s;he been at her own option? What doubt, what jealou&s;ies, what want of tenderne&s;s, what unfavourable prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions, will there be, in a matrimony thus circum|&s;tanced? How will every look, every action, even the mo&s;t innocent, be liable to mi&s;con&s;truction?&mdash;While, on the other hand, an indifference, a care|le&s;&s;ne&s;s to oblige, may take place; and Fear <HI>only</HI> can con&s;train even an <HI>appearance</HI> of what ought to be the real effect of undi&s;gui&s;ed Love?</P>
<P>Think &s;eriou&s;ly of the&s;e things, dear good Sir, and repre&s;ent them to my papa, in that &s;trong light which the &s;ubject will bear; but in which my &s;ex, and my tender years and inexperience, will not permit me to paint it; and u&s;e your powerful intere&s;t, that your poor niece may not be con&s;igned to a mi&s;ery &s;o durable.</P>
<P>I have offer'd to engage not to marry at all, if that condition may be accepted. What a di&s;grace is it to me to be thus &s;eque&s;ter'd from company, thus ba|ni&s;h'd my papa's and mamma's pre&s;ence, thus &s;lighted and de&s;erted by you, Sir, and my other kind uncle! And to be hinder'd from attending at that public wor&s;hip, which, were I <HI>out</HI> of the way of my duty, would be mo&s;t likely to reduce me into the right path again!&mdash;Is this the way, Sir, can it be thought, to be taken with a free and open &s;pirit?&mdash;May not this &s;trange method rather harden than convince?&mdash;I can|not bear to live in di&s;grace thus: The very &s;ervants, &s;o lately permitted to be under my own direction, hardly daring to &s;peak to me; my own &s;ervant di&s;|carded with high marks of unde&s;erved &s;u&s;picion and di&s;plea&s;ure, and my &s;i&s;ter's maid &s;et over me.</P>
<P>The matter may be too far pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h'd: Indeed it may: And then, perhaps, every one will be &s;orry for their parts in it.</P>
<P>May I be &s;uffered to mention an expedient?&mdash;If

I <HI>am</HI> to be watch'd, bani&s;h'd, and confin'd; Suppo&s;e, Sir, it were to be at your hou&s;e?&mdash;Then the neigh|bouring gentry will the le&s;s wonder, that the per&s;on of whom they u&s;ed to think &s;o favourably, appeared not at church here; and that &s;he received not their vi&s;its.</P>
<P>I hope, there can be no objection to This.

<P>IT grieves me to be forced to deny you any thing you a&s;k.

<P>Let me tell you, the virtue of obedience lies not in obliging when you can be obliged again:&mdash;But give up an inclination, and there is &s;ome merit in That.</P>
<P>As to your expedient: You &s;hall not come to my hou&s;e, Mi&s;s Clary; tho' this is a prayer I little thought I ever &s;hould have deny'd you: For were you to keep your word as to <HI>&s;eeing</HI> no-body but whom we plea&s;e, yet can you <HI>write</HI> to &s;omebody el&s;e, and receive letters from him: This we too well know you can, and have done&mdash;More is the &s;hame and the pity!</P>

<SALUTE>Honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS you have thought fit to favour Mr. Solmes with your particular recommendation, and was very
<PB N="209" REF="222">
earne&s;t in his behalf, ranking him (as you told me, upon introducing him to me) among&s;t your &s;elect friends; and expecting my regards to him accordingly; I beg your patience, while I offer a few things, out of many that I could offer, to your &s;erious con&s;ider|ation, on occa&s;ion of his addre&s;s to me, if I am to u&s;e that word.</P>
<P>I am charged with prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in another per&s;on's favour: You will be plea&s;ed, Sir, to con&s;ider, that, till my brother returned from Scotland, that other per&s;on was not di&s;couraged, nor was I forbid to re|ceive his vi&s;its: And is it &s;uch a crime in me, if I <HI>&s;hould</HI> prefer an acquaintance of Twelve months to one of Two?&mdash;I believe it will not be pretended, that in birth, education, or per&s;onal endowments, a com|pari&s;on can be made between the two. And only let me a&s;k you, Sir, if the one would have been thought of for me, had he not made &s;uch offers, as, upon my word, I think, <HI>I</HI> ought not in ju&s;tice to accept, nor <HI>he</HI> to propo&s;e: Offers, which if <HI>he</HI> had not made, I dare &s;ay, my <HI>papa</HI> would not have required them of him.</P>
<P>But the one, it &s;eems, has many faults:&mdash;Is the other fault-<HI>le&s;s?</HI>&mdash;The principal thing objected to Mr. Lovelace (and a very inexcu&s;able one) is, that he is immoral in his Loves:&mdash;Is not the other in his Hatreds?&mdash;Nay, as I may &s;ay, in his Loves too (the object only differing), if <HI>the love of money</HI> be <HI>the root of all evil?</HI></P>
<P>But, Sir, if I am prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, what has Mr. Solmes to hope for?&mdash;Why &s;hould he per&s;evere? What mu&s;t I think of the man who would wi&s;h me to be <HI>his</HI> again&s;t my inclination?&mdash;And is it not a very har&s;h thing for my friends to de&s;ire to &s;ee me marry'd to one I <HI>cannot</HI> love, when they will not be per&s;uaded but that there is one I <HI>do</HI> love?</P>
<P>Treated as I am, now is the time for me to &s;peak out, or never.&mdash;Let me review what it is Mr. Solmes depends upon on this occa&s;ion. Does he believe, that the di&s;grace which I &s;uffer on his account, will give
<PB N="210" REF="223">
him a merit with me? Does he think to win my e&s;teem, thro' my uncles &s;ternne&s;s to me; by my bro|ther's contemptuous u&s;age; by my &s;i&s;ter's unkindne&s;s; by being deny'd to vi&s;it, or be vi&s;ited; and to corre|&s;pond with my cho&s;en friend, altho' a per&s;on of un|exceptionable honour and prudence, and of my own &s;ex; my &s;ervant to be torn from me, and another &s;er|vant &s;et over me; to be confined, like a pri&s;oner, to narrow and di&s;graceful limits, in order avowedly to mortify me, and to break my &s;pirit; to be turn'd out of that family-management which I loved, and had the greater plea&s;ure in it, becau&s;e it was an ea&s;e, as I thought, to my mamma, and what my &s;i&s;ter cho&s;e not; and yet, tho' time hangs heavy upon my hands, to be &s;o put out of my cour&s;e, that I have as little inclination as liberty to pur&s;ue any of the choice delights of my life&mdash;Are the&s;e &s;teps nece&s;&s;ary to reduce me to a &s;tandard &s;o low, as to make me a fit wife for this man?&mdash;Yet the&s;e are all he can have to tru&s;t to&mdash;And if his reliance is on the&s;e mea&s;ures, I would have him to know, that he mi&s;takes <HI>meekne&s;s</HI> and <HI>gentlene&s;s</HI> of di&s;po&s;ition for <HI>&s;ervility</HI> and <HI>ba&s;ene&s;s</HI> of heart.</P>
<P>I be&s;eech you, Sir, to let the natural turn and bent of <HI>his</HI> mind, and <HI>my</HI> mind be con&s;idered: What are his qualities, by which he would hope to win my e&s;teem?&mdash;Dear, dear Sir, if I <HI>am</HI> to be compelled, let it be in favour of a man that can read and write&mdash;That can <HI>teach</HI> me &s;omething: For what a hu&s;band mu&s;t that man make, who can do nothing but com|mand; and needs him&s;elf the in&s;truction he &s;hould be qualified to give?</P>
<P>I may be conceited, Sir; I may be vain of my little reading; of my writing; as of late I have more than once been told I am&mdash;But, Sir, the more unequal the propo&s;ed match, if &s;o: The better opinion I have of my&s;elf, the wor&s;e I mu&s;t have of him; and the more unfit are we for each other.</P>
<P>Indeed, Sir, I mu&s;t &s;ay, I thought my friends had
<PB N="211" REF="224">
put a higher value upon me. My brother pretended once, that it was owing to &s;uch value, that Mr. Love|lace's addre&s;s was prohibited.&mdash;Can this be; and &s;uch a man as Mr. Solmes be intended for me?</P>
<P>As to his propo&s;ed &s;ettlements, I hope I &s;hall not incur your greater di&s;plea&s;ure, if I &s;ay what all who know me have rea&s;on to think, and &s;ome have up|braided me for, that I de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e motives. Dear, dear Sir, what are &s;ettlements to one who has as much of her own as &s;he wi&s;hes for?&mdash;Who has more in her own power, as a &s;ingle per&s;on, than it is probable &s;he would be permitted to have at her di&s;po&s;al, as a wife!&mdash;Who&s;e expences and ambition are moderate; and, if &s;he had &s;uperfluities, would rather di&s;pen&s;e them to the nece&s;&s;itous, than lay them by her u&s;ele&s;s? If then &s;uch narrow motives have &s;o little weight with me for my <HI>own</HI> benefit, &s;hall the remote and uncer|tain view of family-aggrandizement, and that in the per&s;on of my <HI>brother</HI> and his <HI>de&s;cendants,</HI> be thought &s;ufficient to influence me?</P>
<P>Has the behaviour of that brother to me of late, or his con&s;ideration for the family (which had &s;o little weight with him, that he could choo&s;e to hazard a life &s;o ju&s;tly precious as an only &s;on's, rather than not gratify pa&s;&s;ions which he is above attempting to &s;ubdue, and, give me leave to &s;ay, has been too much indulged in, ei|ther for his own good, or the peace of any-body related to him; Has his behaviour, I &s;ay) de&s;erved of <HI>me</HI> in particular, that I &s;hould make a &s;acrifice of my tem|poral (and, who knows? of my eternal) happine&s;s, to promote a plan, that, if I might be permitted to exa|mine it, I will venture to engage to demon&s;trate it to be, if not ab&s;urd, very precarious, and what mu&s;t depend upon improbable contingencies?</P>
<P>I am afraid you will condemn my warmth: But does not the occa&s;ion require it? To the want of a greater degree of earne&s;tne&s;s in my oppo&s;ition, it &s;eems, it is owing, that &s;uch advances have been made, as

have been made. Then, dear Sir, allow &s;omething, I be&s;eech you, for a &s;pirit rai&s;ed and imbittered by di&s;graces, which (knowing my own heart) I am con|fident to &s;ay, are unmerited.</P>
<P>But why have I &s;aid &s;o much, in an&s;wer to the &s;uppo&s;ed charge of prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, when I have declared to my mamma, as now, Sir, I do to you, that if it be not in&s;i&s;ted upon that I &s;hall marry any other per|&s;on, particularly this Mr. Solmes, I will enter into any engagements never to have the other, nor any man el&s;e, without their con&s;ents; that is to &s;ay, without the con&s;ents of my Father and Mother, and of you my Uncle, and my elde&s;t Uncle, and my cou&s;in Mor|den, as he is one of the tru&s;tees for my grandfather's bounty to me.&mdash;As to my Brother indeed, I cannot &s;ay, that his treatment of me has been, of late, &s;o brotherly, as to intitle him to more than civility from me: And for <HI>this,</HI> give me leave to add, he would be very much my debtor.</P>
<P>If I have not been explicit enough in declaring my di&s;|like to Mr. Solmes, that the charge of <HI>prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion</HI> may not be &s;uppo&s;ed to influence me again&s;t him, I do de|clare &s;olemnly, That, were there no &s;uch man as Mr. Lovelace in the world, I would not have <HI>him.</HI> It is nece&s;&s;ary, in &s;ome <HI>one</HI> of my letters to my dear friends, that I &s;hould write &s;o clearly as to put this out of all doubt: And to whom can I better addre&s;s my&s;elf, with an explicitne&s;s that can admit of no mi&s;|take, than to a gentleman who profe&s;&s;es the highe&s;t regard for plain-dealing and &s;incerity?</P>
<P>Let me then, for the&s;e rea&s;ons, be &s;till more par|ticular in &s;ome of my exceptions to him.</P>
<P>Mr. Solmes appears to me (to all the world indeed) to have a very narrow mind, and no great capacity: He is coar&s;e and indelicate; as rough in his manners as in his per&s;on: He is not only narrow, but covet|ous: Being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great wealth, he enjoys it not; nor has the &s;pirit to communicate to a di&s;tre&s;s of any
<PB N="213" REF="226">
kind. Does not his own &s;i&s;ter live unhappily, for want of a little of his &s;uperfluities? And &s;uffers he not his aged uncle, the brother of his own mother, to owe to the genero&s;ity of &s;trangers the poor &s;ub&s;i&s;tence he picks up from half-a-dozen families?&mdash;You know, Sir, my open, free, communicative temper: How unhappy mu&s;t I be, circum&s;cribed in his narrow, &s;elfi&s;h circle? out of which, being with-held by this diabolical par&s;imony, he dare no more &s;tir, than a conjurer out of his; nor would let me.</P>
<P>Such a man as this, <HI>love!</HI>&mdash;Yes, perhaps he may, my grandfather's e&s;tate; which he has told &s;everal per&s;ons (and could not re&s;i&s;t hinting it to me, with that &s;ort of plea&s;ure which a low mind takes, when it intimates its own intere&s;t as a &s;ufficient motive for it to expect another's favour) lies &s;o extremely con|venient for him, that it would double the value of a con&s;iderable part of his own. That e&s;tate, and an alliance which would do credit to his ob&s;curity and narrowne&s;s, may make him think he <HI>can</HI> love, and induce him to believe he <HI>does:</HI> But, at mo&s;t, it is but a &s;econd-place Love. Riches were, are, and al|ways will be, his predominant pa&s;&s;ion. <HI>His</HI> were left him by a mi&s;er, on this very account: And I mu&s;t be obliged to forego all the choice delights of my life, and be as mean as he, or el&s;e be quite unhappy! Par|don, Sir, this &s;everity of expre&s;&s;ion!&mdash;One is apt to &s;ay more than one would, of a per&s;on one di&s;likes, when more is &s;aid in his favour than he can po&s;&s;ibly de&s;erve; and when he is urged to my acceptance with &s;o much vehemence, that there is no choice left me.</P>
<P>Whether the&s;e things be perfectly &s;o, or not, while I <HI>think</HI> they are, it is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould ever look upon him in the light he is offered to me. Nay, were he to be proved ten times better than I have re|pre&s;ented him, and &s;incerely think him; yet would he be &s;till ten times more di&s;agreeable to me than
<PB N="214" REF="227">
any other man I know in the world. Let me there|fore be&s;eech you, Sir, to become an advocate for your niece, that &s;he may not be made a victim of, to a man &s;o highly di&s;gu&s;tful to her.</P>
<P>You, and my other uncle, can do a great deal for me, if you plea&s;e, with my papa. Be per&s;uaded, Sir, that it is not ob&s;tinacy I am governed by: It is aver|&s;ion; an aver&s;ion I cannot overcome: For, if I have but <HI>endeavoured</HI> to rea&s;on with my&s;elf (out of regard to the duty I owe to my papa's will), my heart has recoiled, and I have been aver&s;e to my&s;elf, for offer|ing but to argue with my&s;elf, in behalf of a man who, in the light he appears to me, has no one merit; and who, knowing this aver&s;ion, could not per&s;evere as he does, if he had the &s;pirit of a man, and a gentle|man.</P>
<P>If, Sir, you can think the contents of this letter rea&s;onable, I be&s;eech you to &s;upport them with your intere&s;t: If not&mdash;I &s;hall be mo&s;t unhappy!&mdash;Never|thele&s;s, it is but ju&s;t in me &s;o to write, as that Mr. Solmes may know what he has to tru&s;t to.</P>
<P>Forgive, dear Sir, this tedious letter; and &s;uffer it to have weight with you; and you will for ever oblige</P>

<HEAD>Mr. <HI>ANTONY HARLOWE,</HI> To Mi&s;s <HI>CLARISSA HARLOWE.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Niece CLARY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU had better not write to us, or to any of us. To me, particularly, you had better never to have &s;et pen to paper, on the &s;ubject whereupon you have written. <HI>He that is fir&s;t in his own cau&s;e,</HI> &s;aith the wi&s;e man, <HI>&s;eemeth ju&s;t: But his neighbour cometh, and &s;earcheth him.</HI> And &s;o, in this re&s;pect, will I be your <HI>neighbour</HI>; for I will &s;earch your heart to the bottom; that is to &s;ay, if your letter be written from
<PB N="215" REF="228">
your heart. Yet do I know what a ta&s;k I have under|taken, becau&s;e of the knack you are noted for at writing: But in defence of a father's authority, in behalf of the good, and honour, and pro&s;perity of a family one comes of, what a hard thing would it be, if one could not beat down all the arguments a rebel child (how loth I am to write down that word of Mi&s;s Clary Harlowe!) can bring, in behalf of her ob&s;tinacy?</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, don't you declare (and that con|trary to your declarations to your mother) that you prefer the man we all hate, and who hates us as bad?&mdash;Then what a character have you given of a worthy gentleman! I wonder you dare write &s;o freely of a man we all re&s;pect. But po&s;&s;ibly it may be for that very rea&s;on.</P>
<P>How you begin your letter!&mdash;Becau&s;e I value Mr. Solmes as my friend, you treat him the wor&s;e&mdash;That's the plain Dun&s;table of the matter, Mi&s;s!&mdash;I am not &s;uch a fool but I can &s;ee That.&mdash;And &s;o a noted whore-monger is to be cho&s;en before a man who is a money-lover! Let me tell you, niece, this little becomes &s;o nice a one as you have been always reckon'd. Who, think you, does mo&s;t inju&s;tice, a prodigal man, or a &s;aving man?&mdash;The one &s;aves his own money; the other &s;pends other people's: But your favourite is a &s;inner in grain, and upon record.</P>
<P>The devil's in your &s;ex! God forgive me for &s;ay|ing &s;o&mdash;The nice&s;t of them will prefer a vile rake and Wh&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e I mu&s;t not repeat the word:&mdash;The <HI>Word</HI> will offend when the <HI>Vicious</HI> denominated by that word will be cho&s;en!&mdash;I had not been a bachelor to this time, if I had not &s;een &s;uch a ma&s;s of contradictions in you all.&mdash;Such <HI>gnat-&s;trainers</HI> and <HI>camel-&s;wallowers,</HI> as venerable Holy Writ has it. What names will perver&s;ene&s;s call things by&mdash;A prudent man, who intends to be ju&s;t to every-body, is a co|vetous man!&mdash;While a vile, pro&s;&s;igate rake is chri&s;|ten'd
<PB N="216" REF="229">
with the appellation of a gallant man, and a polite man, I'll warrant you!</P>
<P>It is my firm opinion, Lovelace would not have &s;o much regard for you as he profe&s;&s;es; but for two rea&s;ons. And what are the&s;e?&mdash;Why out of &s;pite to all of us&mdash;one of them: The other, becau&s;e of your independent fortune. I wi&s;h your good grandfather had not left what he did &s;o much in your own power, as I may &s;ay. But little did he imagine his beloved grand-daughter would have turned upon all her friends as &s;he has done!</P>
<P><HI>What has Mr. Solmes to hope for, if you are prepo&s;|&s;e&s;s'd!</HI> Hey-day! Is this <HI>you,</HI> cou&s;in Clary!&mdash;Has he then nothing to hope for from your father's, and mo|ther's, and our recommendations?&mdash;No nothing at all, it &s;eems!&mdash;O brave!&mdash;I &s;hould think that <HI>this,</HI> with a dutiful child, as we took you to be, was <HI>enough.</HI> Depending on this your duty, we proceeded: And now there is no help for it: For we won't be balked: Neither &s;hall our friend Mr. Solmes, I can tell you that.</P>
<P>If your e&s;tate is convenient for him, what then? Does that, pert cou&s;in, make it out that he does not love you? He had need to expect &s;ome good <HI>with</HI> you, that has &s;o little good to hope for <HI>from</HI> you; mind that. But pray, is not this e&s;tate <HI>our</HI> e&s;tate, as we may &s;ay? Have we not <HI>all</HI> an intere&s;t in it, and a prior right, if right were to have taken place? And was it more than a good old man's dotage, God re&s;t his &s;oul! that gave it you before us all?&mdash;Well then, ought we not to have a choice who &s;hall have it in marriage with you? And would you have the con&s;cience to wi&s;h us to let a vile fellow who hates us all, run away with it?&mdash;You bid me weigh what you write: Do you weigh this, girl: And it will appear we have more to &s;ay for our&s;elves than you were aware of.</P>
<P>As to your hard treatment, as you call it, thank
<PB N="217" REF="230">
your&s;elf for That: It may be over when you will: So I reckon nothing upon that: You was not bani&s;h'd and confin'd till all intreaty and fair &s;peeches were try'd with you: Mind that. And Mr. Solmes can't help your ob&s;tinacy:&mdash;Let that be ob&s;erv'd too.</P>
<P>As to being vi&s;ited, and vi&s;iting, you never was fond of either: So that's a grievance put into the &s;cale to make weight.&mdash;As to di&s;grace, that's as bad to us as to you: So fine a young creature!&mdash;So much as we u&s;ed to brag of you!&mdash;And too, be&s;ides, this is all in your power, as the re&s;t.&mdash;But your heart recoils, when you would per&s;uade your&s;elf to obey your pa|rents&mdash;Finely de&s;crib'd, i'n't it!&mdash;Too truly de&s;cribed, I own, as you go on. I know, that you may love him if you will.&mdash;I had a good mind to bid you hate him; then, perhaps, you'd like him the better: For I have always found a mo&s;t horrid romantic perver&s;e|ne&s;s in your &s;ex. To <HI>do</HI> and to <HI>love</HI> what you &s;hould not, is meat, drink, and ve&s;ture, to you all.</P>
<P>I am ab&s;olutely of your brother's mind, That read|ing and writing, tho' not too much for the wits of you young girls, are too much for your judgments.&mdash;You &s;ay, you <HI>may be</HI> conceited, cou&s;in; you <HI>may be</HI> vain!&mdash;And &s;o you <HI>are,</HI> to de&s;pi&s;e this gentleman as you do. He can read and write as well as <HI>mo&s;t</HI> gentle|men, I can tell you <HI>that.</HI> Who told you Mr. Solmes can't read and write? But you mu&s;t have a hu&s;band who can learn you &s;omething!&mdash;I wi&s;h you knew but your <HI>duty</HI> as well as you do your talents&mdash;That, niece, you have of late to learn; and Mr. Solmes will there|fore find &s;omething to in&s;truct you in. I won't &s;hew him this letter of yours, tho' you &s;eem to de&s;ire it, le&s;t it &s;hould provoke him to be too &s;evere a &s;chool-ma&s;ter, when you are his'n.</P>
<P>But now I think of it, &s;uppo&s;e you <HI>are</HI> readier at your pen than he&mdash;You will make the more u&s;eful wife to him; won't you? For who &s;o good an oeco|nomi&s;t as you?&mdash;And you may keep all his accompts, and &s;ave your&s;elves a &s;teward.&mdash;And, let me tell you,
<PB N="218" REF="231">
this is a fine advantage in a family: For tho&s;e &s;tewards are often &s;ad dogs, and creep into a man's e&s;tate, be|fore he knows where he is; and not &s;eldom is he forced to pay them intere&s;t for his own money. I know not why a good wife &s;hould be above the&s;e things.&mdash;'Tis better than lying abed half the day, and junketing and card-playing all the night, and make|ing your&s;elves wholly u&s;ele&s;s to every good purpo&s;e in your own families, as is now the fa&s;hion among ye&mdash;The duce take ye all that do &s;o, &s;ay I!&mdash;Only that, thank my &s;tars, I am a bachelor!&mdash;Then this is a pro|vince you are admirably vers'd in: You grieve that it is taken from you <HI>here,</HI> you know. So here, Mi&s;s, with Mr. Solmes you will have &s;omething to keep ac|count of, for the &s;ake of you and your children: With t'other, perhaps, you'll have an account to keep, too&mdash;But an account of what will go over the left &s;houlder: only of what he &s;quanders, what he borrows, and what he owes, and never will pay. Come, come, cou&s;in, you know nothing of the world; a man's a man, and you may have many partners in a hand&s;ome man, and co&s;tly ones too, who may lavi&s;h away all you &s;ave. Mr. Solmes therefore for my money, and I hope for yours!</P>
<P>But Mr. Solmes is a coar&s;e man, he is not delicate enough for your nicene&s;s, becau&s;e I &s;uppo&s;e he dre&s;|&s;es not like a fop and a coxcomb, and becau&s;e he lays not him&s;elf out in complimental non&s;en&s;e, the poi&s;on of female minds. He is a man of &s;en&s;e, I can tell you. No man tal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s more to the purpo&s;e to <HI>us:</HI>&mdash;But you &s;ly him &s;o, that he has no opportunity given him, to expre&s;s it to <HI>you:</HI> And a man who loves, if he have ever &s;o much &s;en&s;e, looks like a fool; e&s;pecially when he is de&s;pi&s;ed, and treated as you treated him the la&s;t time he was in your company.</P>
<P>As to his &s;i&s;ter; &s;he threw her&s;elf away, (as you want to do) again&s;t his full warning: For he told her what &s;he had to tru&s;t to, if &s;he married where &s;he did
<PB N="219" REF="232">
marry. And he was as good as his word; and &s;o an hone&s;t man ought: Offences again&s;t warning ought to be &s;marted for. Take care This be not your ca&s;e. Mind that.</P>
<P>His uncle de&s;erves no favour from <HI>him,</HI> for he would have circumvented him, and got Sir Oliver to leave to him&s;elf the e&s;tate he had always de&s;igned for him his nephew; and brought him up in the hope of it. <HI>Too ready forgivene&s;s does but encourage offences:</HI> That's your good father's maxim: And there would not be &s;o many head&s;trong daughters as there are, if this maxim were kept in mind.&mdash;Puni&s;hments are of &s;er|vice to offenders; Rewards &s;hould be only to the me|riting: And I think the former are to be dealt out rigorou&s;ly, in wilful ca&s;es.</P>
<P>As to his <HI>love</HI>; he &s;hews it but too much for your de&s;ervings, as they have been of late; let me tell you That: And This is <HI>his</HI> misfortune; and may in time perhaps be <HI>yours.</HI></P>
<P>As to his par&s;imony, which you wickedly call dia|bolical&mdash;a very free word in your mouth, let me tell ye&mdash;Little rea&s;on have <HI>you</HI> of all people for this, on whom he propo&s;es, of his own accord, to &s;ettle all he has in the world: A proof, let him love <HI>riches</HI> as he will, that he loves <HI>you</HI> better. But that you may be without excu&s;e on this &s;core, we will tie him up to your own terms, and oblige him, by the marriage articles, to allow you a very hand&s;ome quarterly &s;um, to do what you plea&s;e with. And this has been told you before; and I have &s;aid it to Mrs. Howe, that good and worthy lady, before her proud daughter, that you might hear of it again.</P>
<P>To contradict the charge of prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to Love|lace, you offer never to have him without our con|&s;ents: And what is This &s;aying, but that you will hope on for our con&s;ents, and to wheedle and tire us out: Then he will always be in expectation, while you are &s;ingle: And we are to live on at this rate
<PB N="220" REF="233">
(are we?), vexed by you, and continually watchful about you; and as continually expo&s;ed to his in&s;o|lence and threats. Remember la&s;t Sunday, girl!&mdash;What <HI>might</HI> have happen'd, had your brother and he met?&mdash;Moreover, you can't do with &s;uch a &s;pirit as his, as you can with worthy Mr. Solmes: The one you make tremble; the other will make you quake. Mind that: And you will not be able to help your|&s;elf. And remember, that if there &s;hould be any mi&s;|under&s;tanding between <HI>one</HI> of them and you, we &s;hould all interpo&s;e; and with effect, no doubt: But with the <HI>other,</HI> it would be <HI>&s;elf-do &s;elf-have,</HI> and who would either care or dare to put in a word for you? Nor let the &s;uppo&s;ition of matrimonial differences frighten you: Honey-moon la&s;ts not now-a-days above a fortnight; and Dunmow flitch, as I have been informed, was <HI>never</HI> claimed; tho' &s;ome &s;ay <HI>once</HI> it was. Marriage is a queer &s;tate, child, whe|ther pair'd by the parties or by their friends. Out of three brothers of us, you know, there was but one had courage to marry. And why was it, do you think? We were wi&s;e by other people's experience.</P>
<P>Don't de&s;pi&s;e money &s;o much; you may come to know the value of it: That is a piece of <HI>in&s;truction</HI> that you <HI>are to learn</HI>; and which, according to your <HI>own</HI> notions, Mr. Solmes will be <HI>able to teach you.</HI></P>
<P>I do indeed <HI>condemn your warmth.</HI> I won't <HI>allow for di&s;graces you bring upon your&s;elf.</HI> If I thought them <HI>unmerited,</HI> I would be your advocate. But it was always my notion, that children &s;hould not di&s;|pute their parents authority. When your grandfather left his e&s;tate to you, tho' his three &s;ons, and a grand|&s;on, and your elder &s;i&s;ter were in being, we all ac|quie&s;ced: And why? Becau&s;e it was our father's do|ing. Do you imitate that example: If you will not, tho&s;e who &s;et it you have the more rea&s;on to hold you inexcu&s;able. Mind that, Cou&s;in.</P>
<P>You mention your brother too &s;cornfully: And, in
<PB N="221" REF="234">
your letter to him, are very di&s;re&s;pectful, as well as in your &s;i&s;ter's, to her. He is your brother; a third older than your&s;elf: And a <HI>man:</HI> And while you can pay &s;o much regard to one man of <HI>a twelve month's acquaintance only,</HI> pray be &s;o good as not to forget what is due to a brother, who (next to us three bro|thers) is the head of the family; and on whom the name depends: As upon your dutiful compliance de|pends the &s;ucce&s;s of the noble&s;t plan that ever was laid down for the honour of the family you are come of. And pray now let me a&s;k you, If the honour of That will not be an honour to you?&mdash;If you don't think &s;o, the more unworthy you. You &s;hall &s;ee the plan, if you promi&s;e not to be prejudiced again&s;t it, right or wrong. If you are not be&s;otted to that man, I am &s;ure you will like it. If you are, were Mr. Solmes an angel, it would &s;ignify nothing: For the devil is Love, and Love is the devil, when it gets in|to any of your heads. Many examples have I &s;een of that.</P>
<P><HI>If there were no &s;uch man as Lovelace in the world, you would not have Mr. Solmes.</HI>&mdash;You <HI>would not,</HI> Mi&s;s!&mdash;Very pretty, truly!&mdash;We <HI>&s;ee</HI> how your &s;pirit is <HI>imbitter'd</HI> indeed.&mdash;Wonder not, &s;ince it is come to your <HI>will nots,</HI> that tho&s;e who have authority over you, &s;ay, <HI>You &s;hall have the other.</HI> And I am one. Mind that. And if it behoves You <HI>to &s;peak out,</HI> Mi&s;s, it behoves US not to <HI>&s;peak in.</HI> What's <HI>&s;auce for the goofe is &s;auce for the gander:</HI> Take that in your thought too.</P>
<P>I humbly apprehend, that Mr. Solmes <HI>has the &s;pirit of a man, and a gentleman.</HI> I would admoni&s;h you therefore not to provoke it. He pities you as much as he loves you. He &s;ays, He will convince you of his love by deeds, &s;ince he is not permitted by you to expre&s;s it by words. And all his dependance is upon your genero&s;ity hereafter. We hope he <HI>may</HI> depend upon That: We encourage him to think he
<PB N="222" REF="235">
may. And this heartens him up. So that you may lay his con&s;tancy at your parents and your uncles doors; and This will be another mark of your duty, you know.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that you reflect upon your parents, and all of us, when you tell me you cannot in <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> accept of the &s;ettlements propo&s;ed to you. This reflection we &s;hould have wonder'd at from you once; but now we don't.</P>
<P>There are many other very cen&s;urable pa&s;&s;ages in this free letter of yours; but we mu&s;t place them to the account of your <HI>imbittered</HI> &s;pirit: I am glad you mention'd that word, becau&s;e we &s;hould have been at a lo&s;s what to have call'd it:&mdash;Much rather have had rea&s;on to give it a better name.</P>
<P>I love you dearly &s;till, Mi&s;s. I think you, tho' my niece, one of the fine&s;t young gentlewomen I ever &s;aw. But, upon my con&s;cience, I think you ought to obey your parents, and oblige me, and my brother John: For you know very well, that we have nothing but your good at heart; con&s;i&s;tently, in|deed, with the good and honour of <HI>all</HI> of us. What mu&s;t we think of any one of it, who would not pro|mote the good of the whole? and who would &s;et one part of it again&s;t another?&mdash;Which God forbid, &s;ay I!&mdash;You &s;ee I am for the good of <HI>all.</HI> What &s;hall <HI>I</HI> get by it, let things go as they will?

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will wonder to receive a letter from me, and more &s;till at the uncommon &s;ubject of it. But the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e will ju&s;tify me, at lea&s;t in my own apprehen&s;ion; and I &s;hall therefore make no other apology for it.</P>
<P>When you fir&s;t came acquainted with my father's family, you found the writer of This one of the hap|pie&s;t creatures in the world; beloved by the be&s;t and mo&s;t indulgent of parents, and rejoicing in the kind favour of two affectionate uncles, and in the e&s;teem of every one.</P>
<P>But how is this happy &s;cene now changed!&mdash;You was plea&s;ed to ca&s;t a favourable eye upon me. You addre&s;&s;ed your&s;elf to my friends: Your propo&s;als were approved of by them; approved of without con&s;ult|ing me; as if my choice and happine&s;s were of the lea&s;t &s;ignification. Tho&s;e who had a right to all rea|&s;onable obedience from me, in&s;i&s;ted upon it without re&s;erve. I had not the felicity to think as they did; almo&s;t the fir&s;t time my &s;entiments differed from theirs. I be&s;ought them to indulge me in a point &s;o important to my future happine&s;s: But, alas, in vain! And then (for I thought it was but hone&s;t) I told you my mind; and even that my affections were engaged.
<PB N="225" REF="238">
But, to my mortification, and &s;urprize, you per&s;i&s;ted, and &s;till per&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>The con&s;equence of all is too grievous for me to repeat: You, who have &s;uch free acce&s;s to the re&s;t of the family, know it too well; too well you know it, either for the credit of your own genero&s;ity, or for my reputation. I am u&s;ed, on your account, as I never before was u&s;ed, and never before was thought to de&s;erve to be u&s;ed; and this was the hard, the im|po&s;&s;ible condition of their returning favour, that I mu&s;t prefer a man <HI>to</HI> all others, that <HI>of</HI> all others I cannot prefer.</P>
<P>Thus di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and made unhappy, and all for your &s;ake, and thro' your cruel per&s;everance, I write, Sir, to demand of you the peace of mind you have robbed me of: To demand of you the Love of &s;o many dear friends, of which you have deprived me; and, if you have the genero&s;ity that &s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h a man, and a gentleman, to adjure you not to con|tinue an addre&s;s that has been attended with &s;uch cruel effects to the creature you profe&s;s to e&s;teem.</P>
<P>If you really value me, as my friends would make me believe, and as you have declared you do, mu&s;t it not be a mean and &s;elfi&s;h value? A value that can have no merit with the unhappy object of it, becau&s;e it is attended with effects &s;o grievous to her? It mu&s;t be for <HI>your own &s;ake</HI> only, not for <HI>mine.</HI> And, even in this point, you <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be mi&s;taken; for would a pru|dent man wi&s;h to marry one who has not a heart to give? Who cannot e&s;teem him? Who therefore mu&s;t prove a bad wife?&mdash;And how cruel would it be to make a poor creature a bad wife, who&s;e pride it would be to make a good one?</P>
<P>If I am capable of judging, our tempers and incli|nations are va&s;tly different. Any other of my &s;ex will make you happier than I can. The treatment I meet with, and the ob&s;tinacy, as it is called, with which I &s;upport my&s;elf under it, ought to convince
<PB N="226" REF="239">
you of this; were I <HI>not</HI> able to give &s;o good a rea|&s;on for this my &s;uppo&s;ed perver&s;ene&s;s, as that I can|not con&s;ent to marry a man whom I cannot value.</P>
<P>But if, Sir, you have not &s;o much genero&s;ity in your value for me, as to de&s;i&s;t, for <HI>my own</HI> &s;ake, let me conjure you, by the regard due to <HI>your&s;elf,</HI> and to your own future happine&s;s, to di&s;continue your &s;uit, and place your affections on a worthier object: For why &s;hould you make <HI>me</HI> mi&s;erable, and <HI>your&s;elf</HI> not happy? By this means you will do all that is now in your power, to re&s;tore me to the affection of my friends; and, if That can be, it will leave me in as happy a &s;tate as you found me. You need only to &s;ay, That you &s;ee there are no HOPES, as you will perhaps complai&s;antly call it, of &s;ucceeding with me (&mdash;And indeed, Sir, there cannot be a greater truth than this&mdash;) and that you will therefore no more think of me; but turn your thoughts another way.</P>
<P>Your compliance with this reque&s;t, will lay me un|der the highe&s;t obligation to your genero&s;ity, and make me ever</P>

But to &s;ay no|thing of what fires us all with indignation again&s;t you (your owning your prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in a villain's favour, and your impertinence to me and your &s;i&s;ter, and your uncles; one of which has given it you home, child); How can you lay at Mr. Solmes's door, the u&s;age you &s;o bitterly complain of?&mdash;You know, little fool, as you are, that it is your fondne&s;s for Love|lace that has brought upon you all the&s;e things; and which would have happen'd, whether Mr. Solmes had honour'd you with his addre&s;&s;es or not.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Friday, March 17.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Receive, with great plea&s;ure, the early and chear|ful a&s;&s;urances of your loyalty and love. And let our principal and mo&s;t tru&s;ty friends named in my la&s;t know that I do.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="242">I would have thee, Jack, come down, as &s;oon as thou can&s;t. I believe I &s;hall not want the others &s;o &s;oon. Yet they may come down to Lord M's. I will be there, if not to receive them, to &s;atisfy my Lord, that there is no new mi&s;chief in hand, which will require his &s;econd intervention.</P>
<P>For thy&s;elf, thou mu&s;t be con&s;tantly with me: Not for my <HI>&s;ecurity:</HI> The family dare do nothing but bully: They bark only at di&s;tance: But for my <HI>en|tertainment:</HI> That thou may&s;t, from the Latin and the Engli&s;h Cla&s;&s;ics, keep my love-&s;ick &s;oul from drooping.</P>
<P>Thou had&s;t be&s;t come to me here, in thy old cor|poral's coat; thy &s;ervant out of livery; and to be up|on a familiar foot with thee, as a di&s;tant relation, to be provided for by thy intere&s;t above; I mean not in heaven, thou may&s;t be &s;ure. Thou wilt find me at a little alehou&s;e; they call it an inn; The White-Hart; mo&s;t terribly wounded (but by the weather only) the &s;ign:&mdash;In a &s;orry village; within five miles from Harlowe-Place. Every-body knows Harlowe-Place&mdash;For, like Ver&s;ailles, it is &s;prung up from a dunghil, within every elderly per&s;on's remembrance: Every poor body, particularly, knows it: But that only for a few years pa&s;t, &s;ince a certain angel has appeared there among the &s;ons and daughters of men.</P>
<P>The people here, at the Hart, are poor, but hone&s;t; and have gotten it into their heads, that I am a man of quality in di&s;gui&s;e; and there is no reining-in their officious re&s;pect. There is a pretty little &s;mirking daughter; &s;eventeen &s;ix days ago: I call her my Ro&s;e-bud: Her grandmother (for there is no mother), a good neat old woman, as ever filled a wicker-chair in a chimney-corner, has be&s;ought me to be merci|ful to her.</P>
<P>This is the right way with me. Many and many a pretty rogue had I &s;pared, whom I did not &s;pare, had my power been acknowleged, and my mercy
<PB N="230" REF="243">
been in time implored. But th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Debellare &s;uperbos</HI> &s;hould be my motto, were I to have a new one.</P>
<P>This &s;imple chit, (for there is a &s;implicity in her thou wilt be highly plea&s;ed with: All humble; all officious; all innocent&mdash;I love her for her humility, her officiou&s;ne&s;s, and even for her <HI>innocence</HI>) will be pretty amu&s;ement to thee; while I combat with the weather, and dodge and creep about the walls and purlieus of Harlowe-Place. Thou wilt &s;ee in her mind, all that her &s;uperiors have been taught to con|ceal, in order to render them&s;elves le&s;s natural, and more undelightful.</P>
<P>But I charge thee, that thou do not (what I would not permit my&s;elf to do, for the world&mdash;I charge thee, that thou do not) crop my Ro&s;e-bud. She is the only flower of fragrance, that has blown in this vicinage for ten years pa&s;t; or will for ten years to come: For I have look'd backward to the <HI>have-been's,</HI> and forward to the <HI>will-be's</HI>; having but too much lei&s;ure upon my hands in my pre&s;ent waiting.</P>
<P>I never was &s;o hone&s;t for &s;o long together &s;ince my matriculation. It behoves me &s;o to be&mdash;Some way or other, my rece&s;s may be found out; and it will then be thought that my Ro&s;e-bud has attracted me. A report in my favour, from &s;implicities &s;o amiable, may e&s;tabli&s;h me; for the grandmother's relation to my Ro&s;e-bud may be &s;worn to: And the father is an hone&s;t poor man: Has no joy, but in his Ro&s;e-bud.&mdash;O Jack! &s;pare thou therefore (for I &s;hall leave thee often alone; &s;pare thou) my Ro&s;e-bud!&mdash;Let the rule I never de|parted from, but it co&s;t me a long regret, be ob&s;erved to my Ro&s;e-bud! Never to ruin a poor girl, who&s;e &s;implicity and innocence was all &s;he had to tru&s;t to; and who&s;e fortunes were too low to &s;ave her from the rude contempts of wor&s;e minds than her own, and from an indigence extreme: Such an one will only pine in &s;ecret; and at la&s;t, perhaps, in order to re|fuge her&s;elf from &s;landerous tongues and virulence, be
<PB N="231" REF="244">
induced to tempt &s;ome guilty &s;tream, or &s;eek an end in the knee-incircling garter, that, peradventure, was the fir&s;t attempt of abandoned Love.&mdash;No defiances will my Ro&s;e-bud breathe; no <HI>&s;elf</HI>-dependent, <HI>thee</HI>-doubting watchfulne&s;s (indirectly challenging thy in|ventive machinations to do their wor&s;t), will &s;he a&s;|&s;ume. Un&s;u&s;picious of her danger, the lamb's throat will hardly &s;hun thy knife!&mdash;O be not thou the butcher of my lambkin!</P>
<P>The le&s;s be thou &s;o, for the rea&s;on I am going to give thee&mdash;The gentle heart is touched by Love! Her &s;oft bo&s;om heaves with a pa&s;&s;ion &s;he has not yet found a name for. I once caught her eye following a young carpenter, a widow neighbour's &s;on, living (to &s;peak in her dialect) <HI>at the little white-hou&s;e over the way:</HI> A gentle youth he al&s;o &s;eems to be, about three years older than her&s;elf: Play-mates from in|fancy, till his eighteenth and her fifteenth year, furni&s;hed a rea&s;on for a greater di&s;tance in &s;hew, while their hearts gave a better for their being nearer than ever: For I &s;oon perceived the Love reciprocal: A &s;crape and a bow at fir&s;t &s;eeing his pretty mi&s;tre&s;s; turning often to &s;alute her following eye; and, when a winding lane was to deprive him of her &s;ight, his whole body turned round, his hat more reverently d'off'd, than before. This an&s;wered (for, un&s;een, I was behind her) by a low courte&s;y, and a &s;igh, that Johnny was too far off to hear!&mdash;Happy Whelp! &s;aid I to my&s;elf!&mdash;I withdrew; and in tript my Ro&s;e-bud, as if &s;atisfied with the dumb &s;hew, and wi&s;hing nothing beyond it.</P>
<P>I have examined the little heart: She has made me her confident: She owns, &s;he could love Johnny Barton very well: And Johnny Barton has told her, He could love her better than any maiden he ever &s;aw&mdash;But, alas! it mu&s;t not be thought of. Why not be thought of?&mdash;She don't know!&mdash;And then &s;he &s;ighed: But Johnny has an aunt, who will give
<PB N="232" REF="245">
him an hundred pounds, when his time is out; and her father cannot give her but a few things, or &s;o, to &s;et her out with: And tho' Johnny's mother &s;ays, &s;he knows not where Johnny would have a prettier, or notabler wife, yet&mdash;And then &s;he &s;ighed again&mdash;What &s;ignifies talking?&mdash;I would not have Johnny be unhappy, and poor for me!&mdash;For what good would that do <HI>me,</HI> you know, Sir!</P>
<P>What would I give (&mdash;By my &s;oul, my angel will indeed reform me, if her friends implacable folly ruin us not both!&mdash;What would I give) to have &s;o innocent, and &s;o good a heart, as either my Ro&s;e-bud's, or Johnny's!</P>
<P>I have a confounded mi&s;chievous one&mdash;by <HI>nature</HI> too, I think!&mdash;A good motion now-and-then ri&s;es from it: But it dies away pre&s;ently&mdash;A love of in|trigue!&mdash;An invention for mi&s;chief!&mdash;A triumph in &s;ubduing!&mdash;Fortune encouraging and &s;upporting!&mdash;And a con&s;titution&mdash;What &s;ignifies palliating? But I believe I had been a rogue, had I been a plough-boy.</P>
<P>But the devil's in this &s;ex! Eternal mi&s;guiders! Who, that has once tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed, ever recovered his integrity? And yet where there is not virtue, which neverthele&s;s we free-livers are continually plotting to de&s;troy, what is there even in the ultimate of our wi&s;hes with them?&mdash;<HI>Preparation</HI> and <HI>Expectation</HI> are, in a manner, every-thing: <HI>Reflection,</HI> indeed, may be &s;omething, if the mind be hardened above feeling the guilt of a pa&s;t <HI>tre&s;pa&s;s:</HI> But the <HI>Fruition,</HI> what is there in that? And yet, That being the end, nature will not be &s;atisfied without it.</P>
<P>See what grave reflections an innocent &s;ubject will produce! It gives me &s;ome plea&s;ure to think, that it is not out of my <HI>power</HI> to reform: But then, Jack, I am afraid I mu&s;t keep better company, than I do at pre&s;ent&mdash;For we certainly harden one another. But be not ca&s;t down, my boy; there will be time enough
<PB N="233" REF="246">
to give thee, and all thy brethren, warning to choo&s;e another leader: And I fan&s;y thou wilt be the man.</P>
<P>Mean time, as I make it my rule, whenever I have committed a very capital enormity, to do &s;ome good, by way of atonement; and as I believe I am a pretty deal indebted on that &s;core, I intend, before I leave the&s;e parts (&s;ucce&s;sfully &s;hall I leave them, I hope, or I &s;hall be tempted to do double the mi&s;chief by way of revenge, tho' not to my Ro&s;e-bud any), to join an hundred pounds to Johnny's aunt's hundred pounds, to make one innocent couple happy.&mdash;I repeat, there|fore, and for half-a-dozen more <HI>therefores,</HI> &s;pare thou my Ro&s;e-bud.</P>

applau&s;e; and an injunction followed it to all the &s;er|vants, for the &s;tricte&s;t look-out, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould con|trive &s;ome way to &s;end it&mdash;And, about an hour after, an order was given him to throw him&s;elf in her way; and (expre&s;&s;ing his concern for denying her reque&s;t) to tender his &s;ervice to her, and to bring them her letter: Which it will be <HI>proper for him to report,</HI> that &s;he has refu&s;ed to give him.</P>
<P>Now &s;ee&s;t thou not, how many good ends this contrivance an&s;wers?</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, The Lady is &s;ecured by it, again&s;t her own knowlege, in the liberty allowed her of take|ing her private walks in the garden: For this attempt has confirmed them in their belief, that now they have turned off her maid, &s;he has no way to &s;end a letter out of the hou&s;e: If &s;he had, &s;he would not have run the ri&s;que of tempting a fellow who had not been in her &s;ecret: So that &s;he can pro&s;ecute, un&s;u&s;pectedly, her corre&s;pondence with me, and Mi&s;s Howe.</P>
<P>In the next place, It will afford me an opportunity, perhaps, of a private interview with her, which I am meditating, let her take it as &s;he will; having found out by my Spy (who can keep off every-body el&s;e), that &s;he goes every morning and evening to a wood-hou&s;e remote from the dwelling-hou&s;e, under pre|tence of vi&s;iting and feeding a &s;et of Bantam-poultry, which were produced from a breed that was her grandfather's, and which for that rea&s;on &s;he is very fond of; as al&s;o of &s;ome other curious fowls brought from the &s;ame place. I have an account of all her motions here.&mdash;And as &s;he has owned to me in one of her letters that &s;he corre&s;ponds privately with Mi&s;s Howe, I pre&s;ume it is by this way.</P>
<P>The interview I am meditating, will produce her con&s;ent, I hope, to other favours of the like kind: For, &s;hould &s;he not choo&s;e the place I am expecting to &s;ee her in, I can attend her any-where in the ram|bling, Dutch-ta&s;te garden, whenever &s;he will permit
<PB N="235" REF="248">
me that honour: For my implement, hight Jo&s;eph Leman, has given me the opportunity of procuring two keys (one of which I have given him, for rea&s;ons good) to the garden-door, which opens to the haunted coppice, as tradition has made the &s;ervants think it; a man having been found hanging in it about twenty years ago: And Jo&s;eph, upon the lea&s;t notice, will leave it unbolted.</P>
<P>But I was obliged to give him, previou&s;ly, my ho|nour, that no mi&s;chief &s;hall happen to any of my ad|ver&s;aries, from this liberty: For the fellow tells me, that he loves all his ma&s;ters; and, only that he knows I am a man of honour; and that my alliance will do credit to the family; and, after prejudices are over|come, every body will think &s;o; or he would not for the world act the part he does.</P>
<P>There never was a rogue, who had not a &s;alvo to him&s;elf for being &s;o.&mdash;What a prai&s;e to <HI>hone&s;ty,</HI> that every man pretends to it, even at the in&s;tant that he knows he is pur&s;uing the methods that will perhaps prove him a knave to the whole world, as well as to his own con&s;cience!</P>
<P>But what this &s;tupid family can mean, to make all this nece&s;&s;ary, I cannot imagine. My REVENGE and my LOVE are uppermo&s;t by turns. If the latter &s;ucceed not, the gratifying of the former will be my only con&s;olation: And, by All that's good, they &s;hall feel it; altho', for it, I become an exile from my na|tive country for ever.</P>
<P>I will throw my&s;elf into my charmer's pre&s;ence: I have twice already attempted it in vain. I &s;hall then &s;ee what I may depend upon from her favour. If I thought I had no pro&s;pect of that, I &s;hould be tempted to carry her off.&mdash;That would be a rape worthy of a Jupiter!</P>
<P>But all gentle &s;hall be my movements: All re&s;pect|ful, even to reverence, my addre&s;s to her!&mdash;Her hand &s;hall be the only witne&s;s to the pre&s;&s;ure of my
<PB N="236" REF="249">
lip&mdash;my trembling lip: I <HI>know</HI> it will tremble, if I do not <HI>bid</HI> it tremble. As &s;oft my &s;ighs, as the &s;ighs of my gentle Ro&s;e-bud. By <HI>my</HI> humility will I invite <HI>her</HI> confidence: The loneline&s;s of the place &s;hall give me no advantage: To di&s;&s;ipate her fears, and engage her rellance upon my honour for the future, &s;hall be my whole endeavour: But little will I complain of, not at all will I threaten, tho&s;e who are continually threatening me: But yet with a view to act the part of Dryden's lion; To &s;ecure my Love, or to let loo&s;e my vengeance upon my hunters.</P>
<Q><L>What tho' his mighty &s;oul his grief contains?</L>
<L>He meditates revenge, who lea&s;t complains:</L>
<L>And, like a lion &s;lumb'ring in his way,</L>
<L>Or &s;leep di&s;&s;embling, while he waits his prey,</L>
<L>His fearle&s;s foes within his di&s;tance draws;</L>
<L>Con&s;trains his roaring, and contracts his paws:</L>
<L>Till at the la&s;t, his time for fury found,</L>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Sat. night, Mar. 18.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been frighted out of my wits&mdash;Still am in a manner out of breath.&mdash;Thus occa&s;ion'd&mdash;I went down, under the u&s;ual pretence, in hopes to find &s;omething from you. Concern'd at my di&s;ap|pointment, I was returning from the woodhou&s;e, when I heard a ru&s;tling, as of &s;omebody behind a &s;tack of wood. I was extremely &s;urpris'd: But &s;till more, to behold a man coming from behind the fur|thermo&s;t &s;tack. O thought I, at that moment, the &s;in of a prohibited corre&s;pondence!</P>
<P>In the &s;ame point of time that I &s;aw him, he be|&s;ought
<PB N="237" REF="250">
me, not to be frighted: And, &s;till nearer ap|proaching me, threw open a hor&s;eman's coat: And who &s;hould it be but Mr. Lovelace! I could not &s;cream out (yet attempted to &s;cream, the moment I &s;aw a man; and again, when I &s;aw who it was) For I had no voice: And had I not caught hold of a prop, which &s;upported the old roof, I &s;hould have &s;unk.</P>
<P>I had hitherto, as you know, kept him at di|&s;tance: And now, as I recover'd my&s;elf, judge of my fir&s;t emotions, when I recollected his character from every mouth of my family; his enterpri&s;ing tem|per; and found my&s;elf alone with him, in a place &s;o near a bye-lane, and &s;o remote from the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>But his re&s;pectful behaviour &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated the&s;e fears, and gave me others, le&s;t we &s;hould be &s;een to|gether, and information of it given to my brother: The con&s;equences of which, I could readily think, would be, if not further mi&s;chief, an imputed a&s;&s;ignation, a &s;tricter confinement, a forfeited corre&s;pondence with you, my beloved friend, and a pretence for the mo&s;t violent compul&s;ion: And neither the one &s;et of re|flections, nor the other, acquitted him to me for his bold intru&s;ion.</P>
<P>As &s;oon therefore as I could &s;peak, I expre&s;s'd with the greate&s;t warmth my di&s;plea&s;ure; and told him, that he cared not how much he expo&s;ed me to the re&s;entments of all my friends, provided he could gra|tify his own impetuous humour; and I commanded him to leave the place that moment: And was hurry|ing from him; when he threw him&s;elf in the way at my feet, be&s;eeching my &s;tay for one moment; de|claring, that he &s;uffer'd him&s;elf to be guilty of this ra&s;hne&s;s, as I thought it, to avoid one much greater:&mdash;For, in &s;hort, he could not bear the hourly in&s;ults he received from my family, with the thoughts of having &s;o little intere&s;t in my favour, that he could not promi&s;e him&s;elf, that his patience and forbear|ance
<PB N="238" REF="251">
would be attended with any other i&s;&s;ue, than to lo&s;e me for ever, and be triumphed over and in&s;ulted upon it.</P>
<P>This man, you know, has very ready knees. You have &s;aid, that he ought, in &s;mall points, frequently to offend, on purpo&s;e to &s;hew what an addre&s;s he is ma&s;ter of.</P>
<P>He run on, expre&s;&s;ing his apprehen&s;ions, that a temper &s;o gentle and obliging, as he &s;aid mine was, to every-body but him (and a dutifulne&s;s &s;o exemplary inclining me to do my part to others, whether they did theirs or not by me), would be wrought upon in fa|vour of a man &s;et up in part to be reveng'd upon my|&s;elf, for my grandfather's envied di&s;tinction of me; and in part to be reveng'd upon him, for having given life to one, who would have taken his; and now &s;ought to deprive him of hopes dearer to him than life.</P>
<P>I told him, he might be a&s;&s;ur'd, that the &s;everity and ill-u&s;age I met with would be far from effecting the intended end: That altho' I could, with great &s;in|cerity, declare for a Single Life, which had always been my choice; and particularly, that if ever I mar|ry'd, if they would not in&s;i&s;t upon the man I had an aver&s;ion to, it &s;hould not be with the man they di&s;|liked&mdash;</P>
<P>He interrupted me here: He hoped, I would for|give him for it; but he could not help expre&s;&s;ing his great concern, that, after &s;o many in&s;tances of his pa&s;&s;ionate and ob&s;equious devotion&mdash;</P>
<P>And pray Sir, &s;aid I, let me interrupt you in my turn:&mdash;Why don't you a&s;&s;ert, in &s;till plainer words, the obligation you have laid me under by this your boa&s;ted devotion? Why don't you let me know, in terms as high as your implication, that a per&s;everance I have not wi&s;h'd for, which has &s;et all my relations at variance with me, is a merit, that throws upon me the guilt of ingratitude, for not an&s;wering it as you &s;eem to expect?</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="252">I mu&s;t forgive him, he &s;aid, if he, who pretended only to a comparative merit (and otherwi&s;e thought no man living could de&s;erve me), had pre&s;umed to hope for a greater &s;hare in my favour, than he had hitherto met with, when &s;uch men as Mr. Symmes, Mr. Wyerley, and now, la&s;tly, &s;o vile a reptile as this Solmes, however di&s;couraged by my&s;elf, were made his competitors. As to the per&s;everance I mentioned, it was impo&s;&s;ible for him <HI>not</HI> to per&s;evere: But I mu&s;t needs know, that were <HI>he</HI> not in being, the terms Solmes had propo&s;ed were &s;uch, as would have in|volved me in the &s;ame difficulties with my relations that I now laboured under. He therefore took the liberty to &s;ay, that my favour to him, far from in|crea&s;ing tho&s;e difficulties, would be the readie&s;t way to extricate me from them. They had made it im|po&s;&s;ible (he told me, with too much truth) to oblige them any way, but by &s;acrificing my&s;elf to Solmes. They were well appri&s;ed be&s;ides of the difference be|tween the two; one, whom they hoped to manage as they plea&s;ed; the other, who could and would pro|tect me from every in&s;ult; and who had <HI>natural</HI> pro|&s;pects much &s;uperior to my brother's <HI>fooli&s;h</HI> views, of a title.</P>
<P>How comes this man to know &s;o well all our foi|bles? But I more wonder, how he came to have a notion of meeting me in this place!</P>
<P>I was very unea&s;y to be gone; and the more as the night came on apace. But there was no getting from him, till I had heard a great deal more of what he had to &s;ay.</P>
<P>As he hoped, that I would one day make him the happie&s;t man in the world, he a&s;&s;ured me, that he had &s;o much regard for my fame, that he would be as far from advi&s;ing any &s;tep that were likely to ca&s;t a &s;hade upon my reputation, (altho' That &s;tep were to be ever &s;o much in his own favour) as I would be to follow &s;uch advice. But &s;ince I was not to be per|mitted
<PB N="240" REF="253">
to live &s;ingle, he would &s;ubmit it to my con|&s;ideration, whether I had any way but <HI>one</HI> to avoid the intended violence to my inclinations: My father &s;o jealous of his authority: Both my uncles in my father's way of thinking: My cou&s;in Morden at a di&s;tance: My uncle and aunt Hervey aw'd into <HI>in&s;ig|nificance,</HI> was his word: My brother and &s;i&s;ter in|flaming every one; Solmes's offers captivating: Mi&s;s Howe's mother rather of party with them, for mo|tives re&s;pecting example to her own daughter.</P>
<P>And then he a&s;k'd me, if I would receive a letter from his aunt Lawrance, on this occa&s;ion: For his aunt Sadleir, he &s;aid, having lately lo&s;t her only child, hardly looked into the world, or thought of it farther, than to wi&s;h him marry'd, and, preferably to all the women in the world, with me.</P>
<P>To be &s;ure, my dear, there is a great deal in what the man &s;aid:&mdash;I may be allow'd to &s;ay This, with|out an imputed <HI>glow</HI> or <HI>throb.</HI>&mdash;But I told him, neverthele&s;s, that altho' I had great honour for the Ladies he was related to (for his two aunts in parti|cular), yet I &s;hould not choo&s;e to receive a letter on a &s;ubject, that had a tendency to promote an end I was far from intending to promote: That it became me, ill as I was treated at pre&s;ent, to <HI>hope</HI> every|thing, to <HI>bear</HI> every-thing, and to <HI>try</HI> every-thing: When my father &s;aw my &s;teadfa&s;tne&s;s, and that I would die rather than have Mr. Solmes, he would perhaps recede.&mdash;</P>
<P>Interrupting me, he repre&s;ented the unlikelihood there was of that, from the cour&s;es they had enter'd upon; which he thus enumerated:&mdash;Their engaging Mrs. Howe again&s;t me, in the fir&s;t place, as a per&s;on I might have thought to fly to, if pu&s;h'd to de&s;peration:&mdash;My brother continually buzzing in my father's ears, that my cou&s;in Morden would &s;oon arrive, and then would in&s;i&s;t upon giving me po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my grandfather's e&s;tate, in pur&s;uance of the will; which would render
<PB N="241" REF="254">
me independent of my father:&mdash;Their di&s;graceful confinement of me:&mdash;Their di&s;mi&s;&s;ing &s;o &s;uddenly my &s;ervant, and &s;etting my &s;i&s;ter's over me:&mdash;Their engaging my mamma, contrary to her own judgment, again&s;t me: The&s;e, he &s;aid, were all &s;o many flagrant proofs, that they would &s;tick at nothing to carry their point; and were what made him inexpre&s;&s;ibly unea&s;y.</P>
<P>He appealed to me, whether ever I knew my papa recede from any re&s;olution he had once fix'd; e&s;pe|cially, if he thought either his prerogative, or his au|thority, concern'd in the que&s;tion. His acquaintance with our family, he &s;aid, enabled him to give &s;everal in&s;tances (but they would be too grating to me) of an arbitrarine&s;s that had few examples even in the fa|milies of princes: An arbitrarine&s;s, which the mo&s;t excellent of women, my mamma, too &s;everely ex|perienced.</P>
<P>He was proceeding, as I thought, with reflections of this &s;ort; and I angrily told him, I would not per|mit my father to be reflected upon; adding, That his &s;everity to me, however unmerited, was not a warrant for me to di&s;pen&s;e with my duty to him.</P>
<P>He had no plea&s;ure, he &s;aid, in urging any thing that could be <HI>&s;o</HI> con&s;trued; for, however well warranted <HI>he</HI> was to make &s;uch reflections, from the provoca|tions they were continually giving him, he knew how offen&s;ive to <HI>me</HI> any liberties of this &s;ort would be.&mdash;And yet he mu&s;t own, that it was painful to him, who had youth and pa&s;&s;ions to be allow'd for, as well as others; and who had always valued him&s;elf upon &s;peaking his mind; to curb him&s;elf, under &s;uch treat|ment. Neverthele&s;s, his con&s;ideration for me would make him confine him&s;elf in his ob&s;ervations, to facts, that were too flagrant, and too openly avowed, to be di&s;puted. It could not therefore <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> di&s;plea&s;e, he would venture to &s;ay, if he made this natural infer|ence from the premi&s;es, That if &s;uch were my father's behaviour to a <HI>wife,</HI> who di&s;puted not the imaginary
<PB N="242" REF="255">
<HI>prerogative</HI> he was &s;o unprecedently fond of a&s;&s;erting, what room had a daughter to hope, he would depart from an <HI>authority</HI> he was &s;o earne&s;t, and &s;o much more concern'd, to maintain? family-intere&s;ts at the &s;ame time engaging; an aver&s;ion, however cau&s;e|le&s;sly conceived, &s;timulating; my brother's and &s;i&s;ter's re&s;entments and &s;elfi&s;h views co-operating; and my bani&s;hment from their pre&s;ence depriving me of all <HI>per&s;onal</HI> plea or intreaty in my own favour.</P>
<P>How unhappy, my dear, that there is but too much rea&s;on for the&s;e ob&s;ervations, and for this infer|ence; made, likewi&s;e, with more coolne&s;s and re|&s;pect to my family than one would have apprehended from a man &s;o much provok'd, and of pa&s;&s;ions &s;o high, and generally thought uncontroulable!&mdash;</P>
<P>Will you not que&s;tion me about <HI>throbs</HI> and <HI>glows,</HI> if, from &s;uch in&s;tances of a command over his fiery temper, for my &s;ake, I am ready to infer, that were my friends capable of a reconciliation with him, he might be affected by arguments apparently calculated for his pre&s;ent and future good?</P>
<P>He repre&s;ented to me, that my pre&s;ent di&s;graceful confinement was known to all the world: That nei|ther my &s;i&s;ter nor brother &s;crupled to repre&s;ent me as an obliged and favoured child, in a &s;tate of actual rebellion:&mdash;That, neverthele&s;s, every-body who knew me was ready to ju&s;tify me for an aver&s;ion to a man, whom every-body thought utterly unworthy of <HI>me,</HI> and more fit for my <HI>&s;i&s;ter:</HI> That unhappy as he was, in not having been able to make any greater impre&s;&s;ion upon me in his favour, all the world gave me to him:&mdash;Nor was there but one objection made to him, by his very enemies (his birth, his fortunes, his pro&s;pects all unexceptionable, and the latter &s;plendid); and <HI>that,</HI> he thank'd God, and my example, was in a fair way of being removed for ever: Since he had &s;een his error, and was heartily &s;ick of the cour&s;es he had fol|low'd; which, however, were far le&s;s enormous than
<PB N="243" REF="256">
malice and envy had repre&s;ented them to be. But of This he &s;hould &s;ay the le&s;s, as it were much better to ju&s;tify him&s;elf by his actions, than by the mo&s;t &s;o|lemn a&s;&s;everations, and promi&s;es: And then compli|menting my <HI>per&s;on,</HI> he a&s;&s;ured me (for that he always <HI>loved</HI> virtue, altho' he had not follow'd its rules, as he ought), that he was &s;till more captivated with the graces of my <HI>mind:</HI> And would frankly own, that till he had the honour to know me, he had never met with an inducement &s;ufficient to enable him to over|come an unhappy kind of prejudice to matrimony; which had made him before impenetrable to the wi&s;hes and recommendations of all his relations.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, my dear, he &s;cruples not to &s;peak of him|&s;elf, as his enemies &s;peak of him. I can't &s;ay, but his openne&s;s in the&s;e particulars gives a credit to his other profe&s;&s;ions. I &s;hould ea&s;ily, I think, detect an hypocrite: And <HI>this</HI> man particularly, who is &s;aid to have allowed him&s;elf in great liberties, were he to pretend to in&s;tantaneous lights and convictions&mdash;at his time of life too: Habits, I am &s;en&s;ible, are not &s;o ea&s;ily changed. You have always join'd with me in remarking, that he will &s;peak his mind with free|dom, even to a degree of unpolitene&s;s &s;ometimes; and that his very treatment of my family is a proof that he cannot make a mean court to any body for in|tere&s;t &s;ake.&mdash;What pity, where there are &s;uch lauda|ble traces, that they &s;hould have been &s;o mired, and choaked up, as I may &s;ay!&mdash;We have heard, that the man's head is better than his heart: But do you really think Mr. Lovelace can have a <HI>very</HI> bad heart? Why &s;hould not there be &s;omething in <HI>blood</HI> in the human creature, as well as in the ignobler animals? None of his family are exceptionable&mdash;but him&s;elf, indeed. The Ladies characters are admirable. But I &s;hall incur the imputation I wi&s;h to avoid. Yet what a look of cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s does it carry, to take one to ta&s;k for doing that ju&s;tice, and making tho&s;e cha|ritable
<PB N="244" REF="257">
inferences in favour of one particular per&s;on, which one ought without &s;cruple to do, and to make, in the behalf of any other man living?</P>
<P>He then again pre&s;s'd, that I would receive a let|ter from his aunt Lawrance of offer'd protection. He &s;aid, that people of birth &s;tood a little too much upon punctilio; as people of virtue al&s;o did: (&mdash;But indeed Birth, worthily liv'd up to, was Virtue; Virtue, Birth; the inducements to a decent punctilio the &s;ame; the origin of both, one [How came this notion from him!])&mdash;: El&s;e, his aunt would write to <HI>me:</HI> But &s;he would be willing to be fir&s;t appris'd, that her offer would be well receiv'd&mdash;as it would have the appear|ance of being made again&s;t the liking of one part of my family; and which nothing would induce her to make, but the degree of unworthy per&s;ecution which I actually labour'd under, and had further rea&s;on to apprehend.</P>
<P>I told him, that, however greatly I thought my|&s;elf obliged to Lady Betty Lawrance, if This offer came from her&s;elf; yet it was ea&s;y to &s;ee to what it led. It might look like vanity in me, perhaps, to &s;ay, That this urgency in him, on this occa&s;ion, wore the face of art, in order to engage me into mea&s;ures I might not ea&s;ily extricate my&s;elf from. I &s;aid, that I &s;hould not be affected by the &s;plendor of even a Royal title. <HI>Goodne&s;s,</HI> I thought, was <HI>Greatne&s;s:</HI> That the excellent characters of the Ladies of his family weigh'd more with me, than the con&s;ideration that they were half-&s;i&s;ters to Lord M. and daughters of an Earl: That he would not have found encou|ragement from me, had my friends been <HI>con&s;enting</HI> to his addre&s;s, if he had only a <HI>mere</HI> relative merit to tho&s;e Ladies: Since, in that ca&s;e, the very rea&s;ons that made me admire <HI>them,</HI> would have been &s;o many objections to their <HI>kin&s;man.</HI></P>
<P>I then a&s;&s;ur'd him, that it was with infinite con|cern, that I had found my&s;elf drawn into an epi&s;tolary
<PB N="245" REF="258">
corre&s;pondence with him; e&s;pecially &s;ince that corre|&s;pondence had been prohibited:&mdash;And the only agree|able u&s;e I could think of making of this unexpected and unde&s;ired interview, was, to let him know, that I &s;hould from henceforth think my&s;elf obliged to di&s;continue it. And I hoped, that he would not have the <HI>thought</HI> of engaging me to carry it on, by menacing my relations.</P>
<P>There was light enough to di&s;tingui&s;h, that he looked very grave upon this. He &s;o much valued my <HI>free</HI> choice, he &s;aid, and my <HI>unbias'd</HI> favour (&s;corning to &s;et him&s;elf upon a foot with Solmes, in the compul&s;ory methods u&s;ed in that man's behalf), that he &s;hould hate him&s;elf, were he capable of a view of intimidating me by &s;o very poor a method. But, neverthele&s;s, there were two things to be con&s;ider'd: Fir&s;t, That the continual outrages he was treated with; the &s;pies &s;et over him, one of which he had detected; the indignities all his family were likewi&s;e treated with; as al&s;o, my&s;elf, avowedly in malice to him, or he &s;hould not pre&s;ume to take upon him&s;elf to re&s;ent for me, without my leave [The artful wretch &s;aw he would have lain open here, had he not thus guarded]: All the&s;e con&s;iderations called upon him to &s;hew a proper re&s;entment: And he would leave it to me to judge, whether it would be rea&s;onable for him, as a man of &s;pirit, to bear &s;uch in&s;ults, if it were not for my &s;ake. I would be plea&s;ed to con&s;ider, in the next place, whether the &s;ituation I was in (a pri&s;oner in my father's hou&s;e, and my whole family deter|mined to compel me to marry a man unworthy of me; and that &s;peedily, and whether I con&s;ented or not) admitted of delay in the preventive mea&s;ures he was de&s;irous to put me upon, <HI>in the la&s;t re&s;ort only.</HI> Nor was there a nece&s;&s;ity, he &s;aid, if I were actually in Lady Betty's protection, that I &s;hould be his, if I &s;hould &s;ee any thing objectible in his conduct, after|wards.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="259">But what would the world conclude would be the end, I a&s;ked him, were I to throw my&s;elf into the protection of <HI>his</HI> friends, but that it was with &s;uch a view?</P>
<P>And what le&s;s did the world think <HI>now,</HI> he a&s;ked, than that I was confined that I <HI>might not?</HI> You are to con&s;ider, Madam, you have not now an option; and to whom it is owing that you have not; and that you are in the power of tho&s;e (Parents why &s;hould I call them?) who are determin'd, that you &s;hall <HI>not</HI> have an option. All I propo&s;e is, that you will embrace &s;uch a protection;&mdash;but not till you have try'd every way, to avoid the nece&s;&s;ity for it.</P>
<P>And give me leave to &s;ay, that if a corre&s;pondence, on which I have founded all my hopes, is, at this critical conjuncture, to be broken off; and if you are re&s;olved not to be provided again&s;t the wor&s;t; it mu&s;t be plain to me, that you will at la&s;t yield to That wor&s;t&mdash;Wor&s;t to <HI>me</HI> only&mdash;It cannot be to <HI>you</HI>&mdash;And <HI>then!</HI> (and he put his hand clenched to his forehead) how &s;hall I bear the &s;uppo&s;ition?&mdash;<HI>Then</HI> will you be That Solmes's!&mdash;But, by all that's Sa|cred, neither he, nor your brother, nor your uncles, &s;hall enjoy their triumph:&mdash;Perdition &s;eize my &s;oul, if they &s;hall!</P>
<P>The man's vehemence frighten'd me: Yet, in re|&s;entment, I would have left him; but, throwing him&s;elf at my feet again, Leave me not thus, I be|&s;eech you, deare&s;t Madam, leave me not thus, in de&s;pair. I kneel not, repenting of what I have vow'd in &s;uch a ca&s;e as That I have &s;uppo&s;ed. I re-vow it, at your feet!&mdash;And &s;o he did. But think not it is by way of menace, or to intimidate you to favour me. If your heart inclines you [and then he aro&s;e] to obey your father (your <HI>brother,</HI> rather), and to have Solmes, altho' I &s;hall avenge my&s;elf on tho&s;e who have in&s;ulted me, for their in&s;ults to my&s;elf and family; yet will I tear out my heart from This bo&s;om (if po&s;&s;ible, with
<PB N="247" REF="260">
my own hands), were it to &s;cruple to give up its ar|dors to a woman capable of &s;uch a preference.</P>
<P>I told him, that he talked to me in very high lan|guage; but he might a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf, that I never would have Mr. Solmes (Yet that this I &s;aid not in favour to him): And I had declared as much to my relations, were there not &s;uch a man as him&s;elf in the world.</P>
<P>Would I declare, that I would &s;till honour him with my corre&s;pondence?&mdash;He could not bear, that, hoping to obtain <HI>greater</HI> in&s;tances of my favour, he &s;hould forfeit the <HI>only one</HI> he had to boa&s;t of.</P>
<P>I bid him forbear ra&s;hne&s;s or re&s;entment to any of my family, and I would, for &s;ome time at lea&s;t, till I &s;aw what i&s;&s;ue my pre&s;ent trials were likely to have, proceed with a corre&s;pondence, which, never|thele&s;s, my heart condemned.&mdash;</P>
<P>And his &s;pirit him, the impatient creature &s;aid, in|terrupting me, for bearing what he did; when he con&s;idered, that the nece&s;&s;ity of it was impo&s;ed upon him; not by <HI>my</HI> will; for then he would bear it chear|fully, and a thou&s;and times more; but by creatures&mdash;And there he &s;topp'd.</P>
<P>I told him plainly, that he might thank him&s;elf (who&s;e indifferent character, as to morals, had given &s;uch a handle again&s;t him) for all. It was but ju&s;t, that a man &s;hould be &s;poken evil of, who &s;et no value upon his own reputation.</P>
<P>He offer'd to vindicate him&s;elf: But I told him, I would judge him by his own rule&mdash;by his <HI>actions,</HI> not by his <HI>profe&s;&s;ions.</HI></P>
<P>Were not his enemies, he &s;aid, &s;o powerful, and &s;o determined; and had they not already &s;hewn their intentions in &s;uch high acts of even <HI>cruel</HI> compul&s;ion; but would leave me to my choice, or to my de&s;ire of living &s;ingle; he would have been content to undergo a twelvemonth's probation, or more: But he was confident, that one month would either complete all their purpo&s;es, or render them abortive: And I be&s;t
<PB N="248" REF="261">
knew what hopes I had of my <HI>father</HI>'s receding: He did not know him, if I had <HI>any.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;aid, I would try every method, that either my duty or my influence upon any of them &s;hould &s;ugge&s;t, before I would put my&s;elf into any other protection. And, if nothing el&s;e would do, would re&s;ign the envied e&s;tate; and that I dared to &s;ay would.</P>
<P>He was contented, he &s;aid, to abide that i&s;&s;ue. He &s;hould be far from wi&s;hing me to embrace any other protection, but, as he had frequently &s;aid, in the la&s;t nece&s;&s;ity. But, deare&s;t creature, &s;aid he, catching my hand with ardor, and pre&s;&s;ing it to his lips, if the yielding up that e&s;tate will do&mdash;Re&s;ign it;&mdash;and be mine&mdash;And I will corroborate, with all my &s;oul, your re&s;ignation!&mdash;This was not ungenerou&s;ly &s;aid, my dear! But what will not the&s;e men &s;ay to obtain belief, and a power over one?</P>
<P>I made many efforts to go; and now it was &s;o dark, that I began to have great apprehen&s;ions&mdash;I cannot &s;ay from his behaviour: Indeed, he has a good deal rai&s;ed him&s;elf in my opinion, by the per&s;onal re|&s;pect, even to reverence, which he paid me during the whole conference: For altho' he flam'd out once, upon a &s;uppo&s;ition that Solmes might &s;ucceed, it was upon a &s;uppo&s;ition that would excu&s;e pa&s;&s;ion, if any thing could, you know, in a man pretending to love with fervor; altho' it was &s;o levell'd, that I could not avoid re&s;enting it.</P>
<P>He recommended him&s;elf to my favour at parting, with great earne&s;tne&s;s, yet with as great &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; not offering to condition any thing with me; altho' he hinted his wi&s;hes for another meeting: Which I forbid him ever attempting again in the &s;ame place.&mdash;And I'll own to you, from whom I &s;hould be really blameable to conceal any thing, that his arguments (drawn from the di&s;graceful treatment I meet with) of what I <HI>am</HI> to expect, make me begin to apprehend, that I &s;hall be under an obligation to be either the one
<PB N="249" REF="262">
man's or the other's&mdash;And if &s;o, I fancy I &s;hall not incur your blame, were I to &s;ay, <HI>which</HI> of the two it mu&s;t be. You have &s;aid, which it mu&s;t <HI>not</HI> be. But, O my dear, the Single Life is by far the mo&s;t eligible to me: <HI>Indeed</HI> it is. And I yet hope to ob|tain the ble&s;&s;ing of making that option.</P>
<P>I got back without ob&s;ervation: But the appre|hen&s;ion that I &s;hould not, gave me great unea&s;ine&s;s; and made me begin my letter in a greater flutter than he gave me cau&s;e to be in, except at the fir&s;t &s;eeing him; for then, indeed, my &s;pirits failed me; and it was a particular felicity, that, in &s;uch a place, in &s;uch a fright, and alone with him, I fainted not away.</P>
<P>I &s;hould add, That having reproached him with his behaviour the la&s;t Sunday at church, he &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ured me, That it was not what had been repre|&s;ented to me: That he did not <HI>expect</HI> to &s;ee me there: But hoped to have an opportunity to addre&s;s him&s;elf to my father, and to be permitted to attend him home. But that the good Dr. Lewin had per&s;uaded him not to attempt &s;peaking to any of the family, at that time; ob&s;erving to him the emotions his pre&s;ence had put every-body in. He intended no pride, or haughtine&s;s of behaviour, he a&s;&s;ured me; and that the attributing &s;uch to him was the effect of that ill-will which he had the mortification to find in&s;uperable: Adding, That when he bowed to my mamma, it was a com|pliment he intended generally to every one in the pew, as well as to <HI>her,</HI> whom he &s;incerely venerated.</P>
<P>If he may be believed (and I &s;hould think he would not have come purpo&s;ely to defy my family, yet ex|pect favour from me), one may &s;ee, my dear, the force of hatred, which mi&s;repre&s;ents all things:&mdash;Yet why &s;hould Shorey (except officiou&s;ly to plea&s;e her prin|cipals) make a report in his disfavour? He told me, That he would appeal to Dr. Lewin for his ju&s;tification on this head; adding, that the whole conver&s;ation be|tween them turned upon his de&s;ire to attempt to re|concile
<PB N="250" REF="263">
him&s;elf to us all, in the <HI>face of the Church</HI>; and, upon the Doctor's endeavouring to di&s;&s;uade him from making &s;uch a public overture, till he knew how it would be accepted. But, alas! I am de|barred from &s;eeing that good man, or any one who would advi&s;e me what to do in my pre&s;ent difficult &s;ituation!&mdash;</P>
<P>I fancy, my dear, however, that there would hardly be a guilty per&s;on in the world, were each <HI>&s;u&s;pected</HI> or <HI>accu&s;ed</HI> per&s;on to tell his or her own &s;tory, and be allowed any degree of credit.</P>
<P>I have written a very long letter. To be &s;o par|ticular as you require, in &s;ubjects of conver&s;ation, it is impo&s;&s;ible to be &s;hort. I will add to it only the a&s;&s;urance, That I am, and ever will be,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Sunday, March 19.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Beg your pardon, my deare&s;t friend, for having given you occa&s;ion to remind me of the date of my la&s;t. I was willing to have before me as much of the workings of your <HI>wi&s;e</HI> relations as po&s;&s;ible; being verily per&s;uaded, that one &s;ide or the other would have yielded by this time: And then, I &s;hould have had &s;ome degree of certainty to found my ob&s;ervations upon. And indeed, what can I write, that I have not already written?&mdash;You know, that I can do nothing but rave at your &s;tupid per&s;ecutors:
<PB N="251" REF="264">
And That you don't like. I have advi&s;ed you to re|&s;ume your own e&s;tate: That you won't do. You cannot bear the thoughts of having their Solmes: And Lovelace is re&s;olved you &s;hall be his, let who will &s;ay to the contrary. I think you mu&s;t be either the one man's or the other's. Let us &s;ee what their <HI>next</HI> &s;tep will be. As to Lovelace, while he tells his own &s;tory; having behaved &s;o hand&s;omely on his intru&s;ion in the woodhou&s;e; and intended &s;o well at Church; who can &s;ay, That the man is in the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> blameworthy?&mdash;<HI>Wicked people!</HI> to combine again&s;t &s;o <HI>innocent</HI> a man!&mdash;But, as I &s;aid, Let us &s;ee what their <HI>next</HI> &s;tep will be, and what cour&s;e you will take upon it; and then we may be more inlighten'd.</P>
<P>As to your change of &s;tyle to your uncles, and bro|ther, and &s;i&s;ter, &s;ince they were &s;o fond of attri|buting to you a regard for Lovelace, and would not be per&s;uaded to the contrary; and &s;ince you only &s;trengthened their arguments again&s;t your&s;elf by deny|ing it; you did but ju&s;t as I would have done, in giving way to their &s;u&s;picions; and trying what That would do&mdash;But if&mdash;But if&mdash;Pray, my dear, in|dulge me a little&mdash;You <HI>your&s;elf</HI> think it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to apologize to <HI>me</HI> for that change of &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le to <HI>them</HI>&mdash;And till you will &s;peak out like a friend to her un-<HI>que&s;tion</HI>-able friend, I mu&s;t teaze you a little&mdash;Let it run, therefore; for it will run&mdash;</P>
<P>If, then, there be not a rea&s;on for this change of &s;tyle, which you have not thought fit to give me, be &s;o good as to watch, as I once before advi&s;ed you, how the cau&s;e for it will come on: Why &s;houl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it be permitted to &s;teal upon you, and you know nothing of the matter?</P>
<P>When a per&s;on gets a great cold, he or &s;he puzzles, and &s;tudies, how it began; how he&mdash;&s;he got it: And when that is accounted for, down he&mdash;&s;he &s;its con|tented, and lets it have its cour&s;e, or takes a &s;weat, or the like, to get rid of it, if it be very trouble|&s;ome.
<PB N="252" REF="265">
&mdash;So, my dear, before the malady you wot of, yet wot <HI>not</HI> of, grows &s;o importunate, as that you mu&s;t be obliged to &s;weat it out, let me advi&s;e you to mind how it comes on. For I am per&s;uaded, as &s;urely as that I am now writing to you, that their indi&s;creet violence on one hand, and his in&s;inuating addre&s;s on the other, if the man be not a greater fool than any body thinks him, will effectually bring it to This, and do all his work for him.</P>
<P>But let it&mdash;If it mu&s;t be Lovelace or Solmes, the choice cannot admit of debate.&mdash;Yet, if all be true that is reported, I &s;hould prefer almo&s;t any of your other lovers to either; unworthy as <HI>they</HI> al&s;o are. But who, indeed, can be worthy of Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe?</P>
<P>I wi&s;h you don't tax me of harping too much upon one &s;tring. I &s;hould, indeed, think my&s;elf inex|cu&s;able &s;o to do (the rather, as I am &s;o bold, as to imagine it is a point out of all doubt, from fifty places in your letters, were I to labour the proof), if you would ingenuou&s;ly own&mdash;</P>
<P>Own what? you'll &s;ay. Why, my Anna Howe, I hope, you don't think, that I am already in love!&mdash;</P>
<P>No, to be &s;ure! How can your Anna Howe have &s;uch a thought?&mdash;Love, tho' &s;o <HI>&s;hort a word,</HI> has a <HI>broad &s;ound</HI> with it. What then &s;hall we call it? You have help'd me to a phra&s;e that has a <HI>narrower &s;ound</HI> with it; but a pretty <HI>broad</HI> meaning, never|thele&s;s: A <HI>conditional kind of liking!</HI>&mdash;that's it.&mdash;O my friend! Did I not know how much you de&s;pi&s;e Prudery; and that you are too young, and too lovely to be a Prude&mdash;</P>
<P>But, avoiding &s;uch hard names, let me tell you one thing, my dear (which neverthele&s;s I have told you before); and that is This, That I &s;hall think I have rea&s;on to be highly di&s;plea&s;ed with you, if, when you write to me, you endeavour to keep from me any Secret of your heart.</P>
<P>Let me add, That if you would clearly and ex|plicitly
<PB N="253" REF="266">
tell me, how far Lovelace <HI>has,</HI> or has <HI>not,</HI> a hold in your affections, I could better advi&s;e you what to do, than at pre&s;ent I can. You, who are &s;o famed for pre&s;cience, as I may call it, and than whom no young Lady ever had &s;tronger preten&s;ions to a &s;hare of it; have had, no doubt, rea&s;onings in your heart about him, &s;uppo&s;ing you were to be one day his (No doubt but you have had the &s;ame in Solmes's ca&s;e:&mdash;Whence the ground for the hatred of the one; and of the <HI>conditional liking</HI> of the other): Will you tell me, my dear, what you have thought of his <HI>be&s;t</HI> and of his <HI>wor&s;t?</HI>&mdash;How far eligible for the <HI>fir&s;t</HI>; how far rejectible for the <HI>la&s;t?</HI>&mdash;Then weighing both parts in oppo&s;ite &s;cales, we &s;hall &s;ee which is likely to pre|ponderate; or rather which <HI>does</HI> preponderate. No|thing le&s;s than the knowlege of the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of your heart, can &s;atisfy my love and my friend&s;hip. Surely, you are not afraid to tru&s;t <HI>your&s;elf</HI> with a &s;ecret of this nature: If you are, then you may the <HI>more</HI> allowably doubt <HI>me.</HI> But I dare &s;ay, you will not own either: Nor is there, I hope, cau&s;e for either.</P>
<P>Be plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve one thing, my dear, that whenever I have given my&s;elf any of tho&s;e airs of raillery, which have &s;eem'd to make you look about you (when, likewi&s;e, your ca&s;e may call for a more &s;erious turn from a &s;ympathizing friend), it has not been upon tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages which are written, tho' perhaps not <HI>intended,</HI> with &s;uch explicitne&s;s (don't be alarm'd, my dear!) as leaves one little cau&s;e of doubt: But only when you affect re&s;erve; when you give new words for common things; when you come with your <HI>curio&s;ities,</HI> with your <HI>conditional likings,</HI> and with your PRUDE-encies (mind how I &s;pell the word) in a ca&s;e, that with every other per&s;on defies all pru|dence&mdash;Overt-acts of trea&s;on, all the&s;e again&s;t the &s;overeign friend&s;hip we have vowed to each other!&mdash;</P>
<P>Remember, that you found <HI>me</HI> out in a moment.
<PB N="254" REF="267">
You challeng'd me. I owned directly, that there was only my pride between the man and me; for I could not endure, I told you, to think it in the power of any fellow living to give me a moment's unea&s;ine&s;s. And then my man, as I have el&s;ewhere &s;aid, was not &s;uch a one as yours: So I had rea&s;on to impute full as much to my own incon&s;ideration, as to his <HI>power</HI> over me: Nay, <HI>more.</HI> But &s;till more to <HI>yours.</HI> For you rea&s;on'd me out of the <HI>curio&s;ity</HI> fir&s;t; and when the liking was brought to be <HI>conditional</HI>&mdash;Why then, you know, I <HI>throbb'd</HI> no more about him.</P>
<P>O! <HI>pray now,</HI> as you &s;ay, now I have mentioned that my fellow was not &s;uch a charming fellow as yours, let Mi&s;s Biddulph, Mi&s;s Lloyd, Mi&s;s Campion, and me, have your opinion, how far <HI>Figure</HI> ought to engage us: With a view to your own ca&s;e, how|ever&mdash;<HI>Mind that</HI>&mdash;as Mr. T' Antony &s;ays&mdash;And whether <HI>at all,</HI> if the man be vain of it; &s;ince, as you ob&s;erve in a former, that vanity is <HI>a &s;top-&s;hort pride</HI> in &s;uch a one, that would make one ju&s;tly doubt the <HI>worthine&s;s of his interior.</HI> You, our pattern, &s;o lovely in feature, &s;o graceful in per&s;on, have none of it; and have therefore with the <HI>be&s;t</HI> grace always held, that it is not excu&s;able even in a woman.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know, that this &s;ubject was warmly de|bated among us in our la&s;t conver&s;ation, and Mi&s;s Lloyd wi&s;hed me to write to you upon it for your opinion; to which, in every debated ca&s;e, we always defered. I hope you will not be &s;o much ingro&s;s'd by your more weighty cares, as not to have freedom of &s;pirits enough to enter upon the ta&s;k.&mdash;You know how much we all admire your opinion on &s;uch topics; which ever produces &s;omething new and in&s;tructive, as you handle the &s;ubjects. And pray tell us, to what you think it owing, that your man &s;eems &s;o careful to adorn that &s;elf-adorned per&s;on of his; yet &s;o manages, that one cannot for one's heart think him a coxcomb?&mdash;Let this que&s;tion, and the above ta&s;ks,

<P>YOUR la&s;t &s;o &s;en&s;ibly affects me, that I mu&s;t po&s;t|pone every other con&s;ideration, however weighty, to reply to it: And this I will do very di&s;tinctly, and with all the openne&s;s of heart, which our mutual friend&s;hip demands.</P>
<P>But let me ob&s;erve, in the fir&s;t place, <HI>gratefully</HI> ob&s;erve, That if I have in <HI>fifty pa&s;&s;ages</HI> of my letters given you &s;uch <HI>undoubted</HI> proofs of my value for Mr. Lovelace, that you have &s;pared me for the &s;ake of my <HI>explicitne&s;s,</HI> it is acting by me with a genero&s;ity wor|thy of your&s;elf.</P>
<P>But lives the man, think you, who is &s;o very bad, that he does not give even a doubting mind rea&s;on at <HI>one</HI> time to be better plea&s;ed with him, than at <HI>an|other?</HI> And when that rea&s;on offers, is it not ju&s;t to expre&s;s one's &s;elf accordingly?

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Monday, March 20.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THIS letter will account to you, my dear, for my abrupt breaking off in the an&s;wer I was writing to yours of ye&s;terday; and which, po&s;&s;ibly, I &s;hall not be able to fini&s;h, and &s;end you, till to-morrow or next day; having a great deal to &s;ay to the &s;ubjects you put to me in it. What I am now to give you are the particulars of another effort made by my friends, thro' the good Mrs. Norton.</P>
<P>It &s;eems they had &s;ent to her ye&s;terday, to be here this day, to take their in&s;tructions, and to try what <HI>&s;he</HI> could do with me. It would, at lea&s;t, I &s;uppo&s;e they thought, have this effect; To render me inex|cu&s;able with <HI>her</HI>; or to let <HI>her</HI> &s;ee, that there was no room for the expo&s;tulations &s;he had often wanted to make in my favour to my mamma.</P>
<P>The declaration, that my heart was <HI>free,</HI> afforded them an argument to prove ob&s;tinacy and perver&s;e|ne&s;s upon me; &s;ince it could be nothing el&s;e that go|vern'd
<PB N="258" REF="271">
me in my oppo&s;ition to their wills, if I had no particular e&s;teem for another man: And now, that I have given them rea&s;on (in order to obviate this argu|ment) to &s;uppo&s;e that I <HI>have</HI> a preference to another, they are re&s;olved to carry their &s;chemes into execution as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. And in order to this, they &s;ent for This good woman, for whom they know I have even a filial regard.</P>
<P>She found a&s;&s;embled my papa and mamma, my brother and &s;i&s;ter, my two uncles, and my aunt Hervey.</P>
<P>My brother acquainted her with all that had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince &s;he was la&s;t permitted to &s;ee me; with my let|ters avowing my regard to Mr. Lovelace, as they all interpreted them; with the &s;ub&s;tance of their an&s;wers to them; and with their re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>My mamma &s;poke next; and delivered her&s;elf to this effect, as the good woman told me afterwards:</P>
<P>After reciting how many times I had been indulged in my refu&s;als of different gentlemen; and the pains &s;he had taken with me, to induce me to oblige my whole family, in one in&s;tance out of five or &s;ix; and my ob&s;tinacy upon it; O my good Mrs. Norton, &s;aid the dear Lady, could you have thought, that <HI>my</HI> Clari&s;&s;a and <HI>your</HI> Clari&s;&s;a was capable of &s;o determin'd an oppo&s;ition to the will of parents &s;o indulgent to her? But &s;ee what <HI>you</HI> can do with her. The mat|ter is gone too far to be receded from, on our parts. Her papa had concluded every thing with Mr. Solmes, not doubting her compliance. Such noble &s;ettlements, Mrs. Norton, and &s;uch advantages to the whole family!&mdash;In &s;hort, &s;he has it in her power to lay an obligation upon us all. Mr. Solmes, knowing &s;he has good principles, and hoping, by his patience <HI>now,</HI> and good treatment <HI>hereafter,</HI> to engage her gratitude, and by degrees her love, is willing to over|look All!&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="272">[<HI>Overlook</HI> all, my dear! Mr. Solmes to <HI>overlook</HI> all! There's a word!]</P>
<P>So, Mrs. Norton, if you are convinc'd, that it is a child's duty to &s;ubmit to her parents authority, in the mo&s;t important point as well as in the lea&s;t, I beg you'll try <HI>your</HI> influence over her: <HI>I</HI> have none. Her <HI>papa</HI> has none: Her <HI>uncles</HI> neither. Altho' it is her apparent intere&s;t to oblige us All; for, on that con|dition, her grandfather's e&s;tate is not half of what, living and dying, is purpos'd to be done for her. If any body can prevail with her, it is <HI>you</HI>; and I hope you will <HI>heartily</HI> enter upon this ta&s;k with her.</P>
<P>She a&s;k'd, Whether &s;he was permitted to expo&s;tu|late with them upon the occa&s;ion, before &s;he came up to me?</P>
<P>My arrogant brother told her, &s;he was &s;ent for to expo&s;tulate with his <HI>&s;i&s;ter,</HI> and not with <HI>them.</HI> And <HI>This,</HI> Goody Norton [She is always <HI>Goody</HI> with him!], you may tell her, that matters are gone &s;o far with Mr. Solmes, that there is no going back!&mdash;Of con|&s;equence, no room for <HI>your</HI> expo&s;tulation, or <HI>hers</HI> either.</P>
<P>Be a&s;&s;ured of This, Mrs. Norton, &s;aid my papa, in an angry tone, that we will not be baffled by her. We will not appear like fools in This matter, and as if we had no authority over our own daughter. We will not, in &s;hort, be bully'd out of our child by a cur&s;ed rake, who had like to have killed our only &s;on!&mdash;And &s;o &s;he had better make a merit of her obe|dience: For comply &s;he &s;hall, if I live; independent as &s;he thinks my father's indi&s;creet bounty hath made her of me, her father. Indeed &s;ince That, &s;he has ne|ver been what &s;he was before. An unju&s;t beque&s;t!&mdash;And it is likely to pro&s;per accordingly!&mdash;But if &s;he marry that vile Lovelace, I will litigate every &s;hilling with her: Tell her &s;o; and that the Will <HI>may</HI> be &s;et a&s;ide, and <HI>&s;hall.</HI></P>
<P>My uncles join'd, with equal heat.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="273">My brother was violent in his declarations.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter put in with vehemence, on the &s;ame &s;ide.</P>
<P>My aunt Hervey was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, There was no article &s;o proper for parents to govern in, as This of marriage: And it was very fit, mine &s;hould be ob|liged.</P>
<P>Thus in&s;tructed, the good woman came up to me. She told me all that had pa&s;&s;ed; and was very earne&s;t with me to comply; and &s;o much ju&s;tice did &s;he to the ta&s;k impo&s;ed upon her, that I more than once thought, that her own opinion went with theirs. But when &s;he &s;aw what an immoveable aver&s;ion I had to the man, &s;he lamented with me their determin'd re|&s;olution: And then examin'd into the &s;incerity of my profe&s;&s;ion, that I would gladly compound with them by living &s;ingle: Of this being &s;atisfy'd, &s;he was &s;o convinc'd, that this offer (which would exclude Love|lace effectually) ought to be accepted, that &s;he would go down, altho' I told her, it was what I had tender'd over-and-over to no purpo&s;e, and undertake to be guaranty for me on that &s;core.</P>
<P>She went accordingly; but &s;oon return'd in tears; being u&s;ed har&s;hly for urging this alternative:&mdash;They had a right to my obedience upon their own terms, they &s;aid: My propo&s;al was an artifice, only to gain time: Nothing but marrying Mr. Solmes <HI>&s;hould</HI> do: They had told me &s;o before: They &s;hould not be at re&s;t till it was done; for they knew what an intere&s;t Lovelace had in my heart: I had as good as own'd it in my letters to my uncles, and brother, and &s;i&s;ter, altho' I had mo&s;t di&s;ingenuou&s;ly declared otherwi&s;e to my mamma. I depended, they &s;aid, upon <HI>their</HI> in|dulgence, and my <HI>own power</HI> over them: They had not bani&s;h'd me their pre&s;ence, if they did not know that their con&s;ideration for <HI>me</HI> was greater than mine for <HI>them.</HI> And they <HI>would</HI> be obey'd, or I never &s;hould be re&s;tor'd to their favour, let the con&s;equence be what it would.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="274">My brother thought fit to tell the good woman, that her whining non&s;en&s;e did but harden me. There was a perver&s;ene&s;s, he &s;aid, in female minds, a Tra|gedy-pride, that would make a romantic young crea|ture, &s;uch a one as me, ri&s;que any thing to obtain pity. I was of an age, and a turn (the in&s;olent &s;aid), to be fond of a lover-like di&s;tre&s;s: And my grief (which &s;he pleaded) would never break my heart; it would &s;ooner break That of the be&s;t and mo&s;t indulgent of mothers. He added, That &s;he might once more go up to me: But that, if &s;he prevailed not, he &s;hould &s;u&s;pect, that the man they all hated had found a way to attach <HI>her</HI> to his intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Every-body blam'd him for this unworthy reflec|tion; which greatly affected the good woman. But neverthele&s;s he &s;aid, and no-body contradicted him, that if &s;he could not prevail upon her <HI>&s;weet child</HI> (as it &s;eems &s;he had fondly called me), &s;he had be&s;t withdraw to her own home, and there tarry till &s;he was &s;ent for; and &s;o leave her <HI>&s;weet child</HI> to her father's ma|nagement.</P>
<P>Sure no-body ever had &s;o in&s;olent, &s;o hard-hearted a brother, as I have! So much re&s;ignation to be ex|pected from me! So much arrogance, and to &s;o good a woman, and of &s;o fine an under&s;tanding, to be al|lowed in him!</P>
<P>She neverthele&s;s told him, that however &s;he might be ridiculed for &s;peaking of the &s;weetne&s;s of my di&s;po|&s;ition, &s;he mu&s;t take upon her to &s;ay, that there never was a &s;weeter in the &s;ex: And that &s;he had ever found, that by mild methods, and gentlene&s;s, I might at any time be prevailed upon, even in points again&s;t my own judgment and opinion.</P>
<P>My aunt Hervey hereupon &s;aid, it was worth while to reflect upon what Mrs. Norton &s;aid: And that &s;he had &s;ometimes allowed <HI>her&s;elf</HI> to doubt, whether I had been begun with by &s;uch methods as generous tempers are only to be influenced by, in ca&s;es where
<PB N="262" REF="275">
their hearts are &s;uppo&s;ed to be oppo&s;ite to the will of their friends.</P>
<P>She had both my brother and &s;i&s;ter upon her for This: Who referr'd to my mamma, whether &s;he had not treated me with an indulgence that had hardly any example?</P>
<P>My mamma &s;aid, She mu&s;t own, that no indul|gence had been wanting from <HI>her:</HI> But &s;he mu&s;t needs &s;ay, and had <HI>often</HI> &s;aid it, that the reception I met with on my return from Mi&s;s Howe, and the manner in which the propo&s;al of Mr. Solmes was made to me (which was &s;uch as left nothing to my choice), and before I had had an opportunity to con|ver&s;e with him, were not what &s;he had by any means approved of.</P>
<P>She was &s;ilenc'd, you will gue&s;s by whom,&mdash;with, My dear! my dear!&mdash;You have <HI>ever</HI> &s;omething to &s;ay, &s;omething to palliate, for this rebel of a girl!&mdash;Re|member her treatment of you, of me!&mdash;Remember, that the wretch, whom we &s;o ju&s;tly hate, would not dare to per&s;i&s;t in his purpo&s;es, but for her encourage|ment of <HI>him,</HI> and ob&s;tinacy to <HI>us.</HI>&mdash;Mrs. Norton (angrily to her), go up to her once more&mdash;and if you think gentlene&s;s will do&mdash;you have a commi&s;&s;ion to be gentle.&mdash;If it won't, never make u&s;e of that plea again.</P>
<P>Ay, my good woman, &s;aid my mamma, try <HI>your</HI> force with her. My &s;i&s;ter Hervey and I will go up to her, and bring her down in our hands, to receive her father's ble&s;&s;ing, and a&s;&s;urances of every-body's love, if &s;he will be prevailed upon: And, in that ca&s;e, we will all love you the better for your good offices.</P>
<P>She came up to me, and repeated all the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages with tears:&mdash;But, after what had pa&s;&s;ed between us, I told her, that &s;he could not hope to prevail upon me to comply with mea&s;ures &s;o wholly my brother's; and &s;o much to my aver&s;ion.&mdash;And then folding me to her maternal bo&s;om, I leave you, my deare&s;t Mi&s;s, &s;aid
<PB N="263" REF="276">
&s;he!&mdash;I leave you, becau&s;e I <HI>mu&s;t!</HI>&mdash;But let me be|&s;eech you to do nothing ra&s;hly; nothing unbecoming your character. If all be true that is &s;aid, Mr. Love|lace cannot de&s;erve you. If you <HI>can</HI> comply, re|member it is your <HI>duty</HI> to comply. They take not, I own, the right method with &s;o generous a &s;pirit. But remember, that there would not be any merit in your compliance, if it were <HI>not</HI> to be again&s;t your own will. Remember al&s;o, what is expected from a character &s;o extraordinary as yours: Remember, it is in your power to unite or di&s;unite your whole fa|mily for ever. Altho' it &s;hould at <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> be di&s;agree|able to you to be thus compelled, your prudence, I dare &s;ay, when you con&s;ider the matter &s;eriou&s;ly, will enable you to get over all prejudices again&s;t the one, and all prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in favour of the other: And then the obligation you will lay all your family un|der, will be not only meritorious in you, with regard to <HI>them,</HI> but in a few months, very probably, highly &s;atisfactory, as well as reputable, to <HI>your&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>Con&s;ider, my dear mamma Norton, &s;aid I, <HI>only</HI> con&s;ider, that it is not a &s;mall thing that is in&s;i&s;ted upon; nor for a &s;hort duration: It is for my <HI>Life.</HI>&mdash;Con&s;ider too, that all This is owing to an overbear|ing brother, who governs every-body. Con&s;ider how de&s;irous I am to oblige them, if a <HI>&s;ingle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ife,</HI> and breaking all corre&s;pondence with the man they hate becau&s;e my brother hates him, would do it.</P>
<P>I con&s;ider every-thing, my deare&s;t Mi&s;s: And, add|ed to what I have &s;aid, do <HI>you</HI> only con&s;ider, that if, by pur&s;uing your <HI>own</HI> will, and rejecting <HI>theirs,</HI> you <HI>&s;hould</HI> be unhappy, you will be deprived of all that con&s;olation which tho&s;e have, who have been directed by their <HI>parents,</HI> altho' the event prove not an&s;wer|able to their wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> go, repeated &s;he;&mdash;your brother will &s;ay (and &s;he wept), that I harden you by my <HI>whining non|&s;en&s;e.</HI> 'Tis indeed hard, that &s;o much regard &s;hould

be paid to the <HI>humours</HI> of one child; and &s;o little to the <HI>inclination</HI> of another. But let me repeat, that it is your <HI>duty</HI> to acquie&s;ce, if you <HI>can</HI> acquie&s;ce: Your father has given your brother's &s;chemes <HI>his</HI> &s;anction; and they are now <HI>his.</HI> Mr. Lovelace, I doubt, is not a man that will ju&s;tify <HI>your</HI> choice, &s;o much as he will <HI>their</HI> di&s;like. It is too ea&s;y to &s;ee that your brother has a <HI>view</HI> in di&s;crediting you with all your friends, with your uncles in particular: But for that very rea&s;on, you &s;hould comply, if po&s;&s;ible, in order to di&s;concert his ungenerous mea&s;ures. I will pray for you; and that is all I can do for you. I mu&s;t now go down, and make a report, that you are re|&s;olved never to have Mr. Solmes:&mdash;Mu&s;t I?&mdash;Con|&s;ider, Mi&s;s,&mdash;<HI>Mu&s;t</HI> I?</P>
<P>Indeed you mu&s;t!&mdash;But of This I do a&s;&s;ure you, that I will do nothing to di&s;grace the part you have had in my education. I will bear every-thing, that &s;hall be &s;hort of forcing my hand into <HI>his,</HI> who never can have any &s;hare in my heart. I will try, by pa|tient duty, by humility, to overcome them. But death will I choo&s;e, in any &s;hape, rather than That man.</P>
<P>I dread to go down, &s;aid &s;he, with &s;o determin'd an an&s;wer: They will have no patience with me.&mdash;But let me leave you with one ob&s;ervation, which I beg of you always to bear in mind:&mdash;</P>

<P>In order to acquit my&s;elf of &s;o heavy a charge as that of having re&s;erves to &s;o dear a friend, I will ac|knowlege (and I thought I had over and over), that it is owing to my particular &s;ituation, if Mr. Love|lace appears to me in a tolerable light: And I take upon me to &s;ay, that had they oppo&s;ed to him a man of &s;en&s;e, of virtue, of genero&s;ity; one who enjoy'd his fortune with credit; who had a tenderne&s;s in his na|ture for the calamities of others, which would have given a moral a&s;&s;urance, that he would have been &s;till le&s;s wanting in grateful returns to an obliging &s;pirit:&mdash;Had they oppo&s;ed &s;uch a man as this to Mr. Lovelace, and been as earne&s;t to have me marry'd, as now they are, I do not know my&s;elf, if they would have had rea|&s;on to tax me with that invincible ob&s;tinacy which they lay to my charge: And this, whatever had been the <HI>Figure</HI> of the man: Since the <HI>Heart</HI> is what we women &s;hould judge by in the choice we make, as the be&s;t
<PB N="267" REF="280">
&s;ecurity for the party's good behaviour in every relation of life.</P>
<P>But, &s;ituated as I am, thus per&s;ecuted, and driven; I own to you, that I have now and then had a little more difficulty than I wi&s;h'd for, in pa&s;&s;ing by Mr. Lovelace's tolerable qualities, to keep up my di&s;like to him for his others.</P>
<P>You &s;ay, I mu&s;t have argued with my&s;elf in his favour, and in his disfavour, on a &s;uppo&s;ition, that I might po&s;&s;ibly be one day his. I own, that I have: And thus called upon by my deare&s;t friend, I will &s;et before you both parts of the argument.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, <HI>what occurred to me in his favour.</HI></P>
<P>At his introduction into our family, his negative virtues were in&s;i&s;ted upon:&mdash;He was no game&s;ter; no hor&s;e-racer; no fox-hunter; no drinker: My poor aunt Hervey had, in confidence, given us to apprehend much di&s;agreeable evil, e&s;pecially to a wife of the lea&s;t delicacy, from a wine-lover: And com|mon &s;en&s;e in&s;tructed us, that Sobriety in a man, is no &s;mall point to be &s;ecured, when &s;o many mi&s;chiefs happen daily from exce&s;s. I remember, that my &s;i&s;ter made the mo&s;t of this favourable circum&s;tance in his character, while &s;he had any hopes of him.</P>
<P>He was never thought to be a niggard: Not even ungenerous: Nor, when his conduct came to be in|quired into, an extravagant, or &s;quanderer: His pride (&s;o far was it a laudable pride) &s;ecured him from that. Then he was ever ready to own his errors: He was no je&s;ter upon &s;acred things: Poor Mr. Wyerley's fault; who &s;eemed to think, that there was wit in &s;aying bold things, which would &s;hock a &s;erious mind. His con|ver&s;ation with us was always unexceptionable; even cha&s;tly &s;o; which, be his actions what they would, &s;hew'd him capable of being influenc'd by <HI>decent</HI> com|pany; and that he might probably therefore be a <HI>led</HI> man, rather than a <HI>leader,</HI> in <HI>other.</HI> And one late in&s;tance, &s;o late as la&s;t Saturday evening, has rai&s;ed
<PB N="268" REF="281">
him not a little in my opinion, with regard to this point of good (and, at the &s;ame time, of manly) be|haviour.</P>
<P>As to the advantage of birth, that is of his &s;ide, above any man who has been found out for me: If we may judge by that expre&s;&s;ion of his, which you was plea&s;ed with at the time;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That upon <HI>true</HI> qua|lity, and <HI>hereditary</HI> di&s;tinction, if good &s;en&s;e were not wanting, honour &s;at as ea&s;y as his glove:'</Q>
That, with as familiar an air, was his familiar expre&s;&s;ion;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'while none but the pro&s;perous up&s;tart, MUSHROOM'D into rank (another of his peculiars) was arrogantly proud of it.'</Q>
If, I &s;ay, we may judge of him by this, we &s;hall conclude in his favour, that he knows what &s;ort of behaviour is to be expected from per&s;ons of Birth, whether he act up to it or not. Conviction is half way to amendment.</P>
<P>His fortunes in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion are hand&s;ome; in expecta|tion, &s;plendid: So nothing need be &s;aid on that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>But it is impo&s;&s;ible, &s;ay &s;ome, that he &s;hould make a tender or kind hu&s;band. Tho&s;e who are for im|po&s;ing upon me &s;uch a man as Mr. Solmes, and by methods &s;o violent, are not intitled to make this ob|jection: But now, on this &s;ubject, let me tell you how I have argued with my&s;elf&mdash;For &s;till you mu&s;t remember, that I am upon the extenuating part of his character.</P>
<P>A great deal of the treatment a wife may expect from him, will, po&s;&s;ibly, depend upon her&s;elf. Per|haps &s;he mu&s;t <HI>practi&s;e,</HI> as well as <HI>promi&s;e,</HI> obedience to a man &s;o little u&s;ed to controul; and mu&s;t be care|ful to oblige. And what hu&s;band expects not this?&mdash;The <HI>more,</HI> perhaps, if he has not rea&s;on to a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf of the preferable love of his wife, before &s;he became &s;uch. And how much ea&s;ier and plea&s;anter to obey the man of her choice, if he &s;hould be even unrea&s;onable &s;ometimes, than one &s;he would not have had, could &s;he have avoided it? Then, I think, as
<PB N="269" REF="282">
the men were the framers of the matrimonial office, and made <HI>obedience</HI> a part of the woman's vow, &s;he ought not, even in <HI>policy,</HI> to &s;hew him, that &s;he can break thro' <HI>her</HI> part of the contract, however lightly &s;he may think of the in&s;tance; le&s;t <HI>he</HI> &s;hould take it into his head (him&s;elf is judge) to think as lightly of other points, which <HI>&s;he</HI> may hold more important. But indeed no point, &s;o &s;olemnly vow'd, can be &s;light.</P>
<P>Thus principled, and <HI>acting</HI> accordingly, what a wretch mu&s;t that hu&s;band be, who could treat &s;uch a wife brutally!&mdash;Will Lovelace's <HI>wife</HI> be the only per&s;on, to whom he will not pay the grateful debt of civility and good-manners? He is allow'd to be brave: Who ever knew a brave man, if a man of <HI>&s;en&s;e,</HI> an univer&s;ally ba&s;e man? And how much the gentle|ne&s;s of &s;ex, and the manner of our training-up and education, make us need the protection of the brave, and the countenance of the generous, let the general approbation which we are all &s;o naturally inclin'd to give to men of that character, te&s;tify.</P>
<P>At wor&s;t, will he confine me pri&s;oner to my cham|ber? Will he deny me the vi&s;its of my deare&s;t friend, and forbid me to corre&s;pond with her? Will he take from me the Mi&s;tre&s;ly management, which I had not faultily di&s;charged? Will he &s;et a &s;ervant over me, with licence to in&s;ult me? Will he, as he has not a <HI>&s;i&s;ter,</HI> permit his cou&s;ins Montague, or would either of tho&s;e Ladies <HI>accept</HI> of a permi&s;&s;ion, to in&s;ult and tyrannize over me?&mdash;It cannot be.&mdash;Why then, think I often, do you tempt me, O my cruel friends, to try the difference?</P>
<P>And then has the &s;ecret plea&s;ure intruded it&s;elf, to be able to reclaim &s;uch a man to the paths of virtue and honour: To be a <HI>&s;econdary</HI> means, if I were to be his, of &s;aving him, and preventing the mi&s;chiefs &s;o enterpri&s;ing a creature might otherwi&s;e be guilty of, if he be &s;uch a one.</P>
<P>In the&s;e lights when I have thought of him (and that as a man of &s;en&s;e he will &s;ooner &s;ee his errors, than an|other),
<PB N="270" REF="283">
I own to you, that I have had &s;ome difficulty to avoid taking the path they &s;o violently endeavour to make me &s;hun: And all that command of my pa&s;&s;ions, which has been attributed to me, as my greate&s;t prai&s;e, and, in &s;o young a creature, as my di&s;tinction, has hardly been &s;ufficient for me.</P>
<P>And let me add, that the favour of his relations (all but him&s;elf unexceptionable) has made a good deal of additional weight, thrown into the &s;ame &s;cale.</P>
<P><HI>But now, in his disfavour.</HI> When I have reflected upon the prohibition of my parents: The giddy ap|pearance, di&s;graceful to &s;ex, that &s;uch a preference would have: That there is no manner of likelihood, inflam'd by the rencounter, and upheld by art and ambition on my brother's &s;ide, that ever the animo&s;ity will be got over: That I mu&s;t therefore be at per|petual variance with all my own family: Mu&s;t go to <HI>him,</HI> and to <HI>his,</HI> as an obliged, and half-fortun'd per&s;on: That his aver&s;ion to them all, is as &s;trong, as theirs to him; That his whole family are hated for his &s;ake; they hating ours in return: That he has a very im|moral character as to our &s;ex: That knowing this, it is a high degree of impurity, to think of joining in wedlock with &s;uch a man: That he is young, un|broken, his pa&s;&s;ions un&s;ubdued: That he is violent in his temper; yet artful: I am afraid vindictive too: That &s;uch an hu&s;band might un&s;ettle me in all my own principles, and hazard my future hopes: That his own relations, two excellent aunts, and an uncle, from whom he has &s;uch large expectations, have no influence upon him: That what tolerable qualities he has, are &s;ounded more in pride than in virtue: That allowing, as he does, the excellency of Moral Precepts, and believing the doctrine of future Rewards and Puni&s;hments, he can live as if he de&s;pis'd the one, and defy'd the other: The probability that the taint ari&s;ing from &s;uch free principles, may go down into the manners of po|&s;terity:
<PB N="271" REF="284">
That I knowing the&s;e things, and the im|portance of them, &s;hould be more inexcu&s;able than one who knows them not; &s;ince an error <HI>again&s;t</HI> judgment, is wor&s;e, infinitely wor&s;e, than an error <HI>in</HI> judgment:&mdash;Reflecting upon the&s;e things, I cannot help conjuring you, my dear, to pray <HI>with</HI> me, and to pray <HI>for</HI> me, that I may not be pu&s;h'd upon &s;uch indi&s;creet mea&s;ures, as will render me inexcu&s;able <HI>to</HI> my&s;elf: For that is the te&s;t, after all; the world's opi|nion ought to be but a &s;econdary con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid, in his prai&s;e, that he is extremely ready to <HI>own his errors:</HI> But I have &s;ometimes made a great drawback upon this article, in his disfavour; having been ready to apprehend, that this ingenuity may po&s;|&s;ibly be attributable to two cau&s;es, neither of them, by any means, creditable to him. The one, that his vices are &s;o much his ma&s;ters, that he <HI>attempts</HI> not to con|quer them; the other, that he may think it policy, to give up <HI>one half</HI> of his character, to &s;ave the <HI>other,</HI> when the <HI>whole</HI> may be blameable: By this means, &s;ilencing by acknowlegement the objections he can|not an&s;wer; which may give him the prai&s;e of in|genuou&s;ne&s;s, when he can obtain no other; and when the <HI>challeng'd</HI> proof might bring out, upon di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion, other evils. The&s;e, you'll allow, are &s;evere con&s;tructions; but every-thing his enemies &s;ay of him cannot be fal&s;e.</P>
<P>I will proceed by and by.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES we have both thought him one of the mo&s;t unde&s;igning <HI>merely</HI> witty men we ever knew; at other times one of the deepe&s;t creatures we ever convers'd with. So that, when in one vi&s;it, we have imagin'd we fathom'd him, in the next, he has made us ready to give him up as impenetrable. This, my dear, is to be put among the &s;hades in his character.&mdash;Yet, upon the whole, you have been &s;o far of his
<PB N="272" REF="285">
party, that you have conte&s;ted, that his principal fault is over-frankne&s;s, and too much regardle&s;ne&s;s of ap|pearances, and that he is too giddy to be very artful: You would have it, that at <HI>the time</HI> he &s;ays any thing good, he means what he &s;peaks; That his variablene&s;s and levity are con&s;titutional, owing to &s;ound health, and to a &s;oul and body, that was your ob&s;ervation, fitted for, and plea&s;ed with, each other. And hence you concluded, that could this <HI>con&s;entaneou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> as you call'd it, of corporal and animal faculties, be pointed by di&s;cretion; that is to &s;ay, could his vivacity be confined within the pale of <HI>but</HI> moral obligations; he would be far from being rejectible as a companion for life.</P>
<P>But I u&s;ed then to &s;ay, and I &s;till am of opinion, that he wants a <HI>heart:</HI> And if he does, he wants every-thing. A wrong <HI>head</HI> may be convinc'd, may have a right turn given it: But who is able to give a <HI>heart,</HI> if a heart be wanting? Divine Grace, work|ing a miracle, or next to a miracle, can only change a bad heart. Should not one fly the man who is but <HI>&s;u&s;pected</HI> of &s;uch a one?&mdash;What, O what, do parents <HI>do,</HI> when they precipitate a child, and make her think better than &s;he would otherwi&s;e think of a man of an indifferent character, in order to avoid another that is odious to her!</P>
<P>I have &s;aid, that I think him vindictive: Upon my word, I have &s;ometimes doubted, whether his per|&s;everance in his addre&s;&s;es to me, has not been the more ob&s;tinate, &s;ince he has found him&s;elf &s;o di&s;|agreeable to my friends. From that time, I verily think he has been more fervent in them; yet courts them not; but &s;ets them at defiance. For this, in|deed, he pleads di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s (I am &s;ure he cannot politene&s;s) and the more plau&s;ibly, as he is apprized of the ability they have to make it worth his while to court them. 'Tis true, he has declared, and with too much rea&s;on, or there would be no enduring
<PB N="273" REF="286">
him, that the lowe&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions on his part, would not be accepted; and to oblige me, has offered to &s;eek a reconciliation with them, if I would give him hope of &s;ucce&s;s. As to his behaviour at church, the Sunday before la&s;t, I lay no &s;tre&s;s upon that, becau&s;e I doubt there was too much outward pride in his in|tentional humility, or Shorey, who is not his enemy, could not have mi&s;taken it.</P>
<P>I do not think him &s;o deeply learn'd in human Na|ture, or in Ethics, as &s;ome have thought him. Don't you remember how he &s;tared, at the following trite ob&s;ervations, which every morali&s;t could have furni&s;h'd him with? Complaining, as he did, in a half-menacing &s;train, of the obloquies rai&s;ed again&s;t him&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That if he were innocent, he &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e the obloquy: If not, revenge would not wipe off his guilt.'</Q>

&mdash;What could be the reading he has been &s;aid to be ma&s;ter of, to wonder, as he did, at the&s;e ob&s;ervations?</P>
<P>But, indeed, he mu&s;t take plea&s;ure in revenge; and yet holds others to be inexcu&s;able for the &s;ame fault.&mdash;He is not, however, the only one who can &s;ee how truly blameable tho&s;e errors are in another, which they hardly think &s;uch in them&s;elves.</P>

<P>Well but, methinks you &s;ay, what is all this to the purpo&s;e?

<P>Why then, my dear, if you will have it, I think, that, with all his preponderating faults, I like him bet|ter than I ever thought I &s;hould like him; and, tho&s;e faults con&s;ider'd, better perhaps than I <HI>ought</HI> to like him.

<P>I RESUME; to give you my opinion of the &s;orce which <HI>figure</HI> or <HI>per&s;on</HI> ought to have upon our &s;ex: And this I &s;hall do both <HI>generally,</HI> and <HI>particularly,</HI> as to this man: Whence you will be able to collect how far my friends are in the right, or in the wrong, when they attribute a good deal of prejudice in favour of one man, and in disfavour of the other, on the &s;core of figure. But, fir&s;t, let me ob&s;erve, That they &s;ee abundant rea&s;on, on comparing Mr. Lovelace and Mr. Solmes together, to believe that this <HI>may</HI> be a con|&s;ideration with me; and therefore they believe it <HI>is.</HI></P>
<P>There is certainly &s;omething very plau&s;ible and at|tractive, as well as creditable to a woman's <HI>choice,</HI> in <HI>figure.</HI> It gives a favourable impre&s;&s;ion at fir&s;t &s;ight, in which one wi&s;hes to be confirm'd: And if, upon further acquaintance, we find rea&s;on &s;o to be,
<PB N="276" REF="289">
we are plea&s;ed with our own judgment, and like the per&s;on the better, for having given us cau&s;e to com|pliment our own &s;agacity, in our fir&s;t-&s;ighted im|pre&s;&s;ions. But, neverthele&s;s, it has been generally a rule with me, to &s;u&s;pect a fine figure, both in man and wo|man; and I have had a good deal of rea&s;on to approve my rule. With regard to <HI>men</HI> e&s;pecially; who ought to value them&s;elves rather upon their intellectual than per&s;onal qualities. For, as to our &s;ex, if a fine wo|man &s;hould be led by the opinion of the world, to be vain and conceited upon her form and features; and that to &s;uch a degree, as to have neglected the more material and more <HI>durable</HI> recommendations; the world will be ready to excu&s;e her; &s;ince a pretty fool, in all &s;he &s;ays, and in all &s;he does, will plea&s;e, we know not why.</P>
<P>But who would grudge this pretty fool her &s;hort day! Since, with her &s;ummer's &s;un, when her but|terfly-flutters are over, and the winter of age and furrows arrives, &s;he will feel the ju&s;t effects of hav|ing neglected to cultivate her better faculties; for then, like another Helen, &s;he will be unable to bear the reflection even of her own gla&s;s; and being &s;unk into the in&s;ignificance of a <HI>mere old woman</HI>; &s;he will be intitled to the contempts which follow that cha|racter. While the <HI>di&s;creet matron,</HI> who carries <HI>up</HI> (we will not, in &s;uch a one's ca&s;e, &s;ay <HI>down)</HI> into ad|vanced life, the ever-amiable character of virtuous prudence, and u&s;eful experience, finds &s;olid vene|ration take place of airy admiration, and more than &s;upply the want of it.</P>
<P>But for a <HI>man</HI> to be vain of his per&s;on, how ef|feminate? If &s;uch a one has genius, it &s;eldom &s;trikes deep into intellectual &s;ubjects. His cut&s;ide u&s;ually runs away with him. To adorn, and perhaps, <HI>in|tending</HI> to adorn, to render ridiculous, that per&s;on, takes up all his attention. All he does is <HI>per&s;onal</HI>; that is to &s;ay, <HI>for</HI> him&s;elf: All he admires, <HI>is</HI> him|&s;elf:
<PB N="277" REF="290">
And in &s;pite of the corrections of the &s;tage, which &s;o often, and &s;o ju&s;tly expo&s;es a coxcomb, he generally dwindles down, and &s;inks into that cha|racter; and, of con&s;equence, becomes the &s;corn of one &s;ex, and the je&s;t of the other.</P>

But if a man, <HI>be&s;ides</HI> figure, has learning, and &s;uch talents, as <HI>would</HI> have di&s;tingui&s;h'd him, whatever were his form; then indeed <HI>per&s;on</HI> is an addition: And if he has not run too egregiou&s;ly into &s;elf-ad|miration; and if he has pre&s;erved his morals, he is truly a valuable being.</P>
<P>Mr. Lovelace has certainly ta&s;te; and, as far as I am able to determine, he has judgment in mo&s;t of the politer arts. But altho' he has a humorous way of carrying it off, yet one may &s;ee, that he values him|&s;elf not a little, both on his per&s;on and his parts, and even upon his dre&s;s; and yet he has &s;o happy an ea&s;e in the latter, that it &s;eems to be the lea&s;t part of his &s;tudy. And as to the former, I &s;hould hold my&s;elf in|excu&s;able, if I were to add to his vanity by &s;hewing the lea&s;t regard for what is too evidently &s;o much his.</P>
<P>And now, my dear, let me a&s;k you; Have I come up to your expectation? If I have not, when my mind is more at ca&s;e, I will endeavour to plea&s;e you better. For, methinks, my &s;entences drag; my &s;tyle creeps; my imagination is &s;unk; my &s;pirit &s;erves me not; only to tell you, That whether I have little or much, it is all devoted to the commands of my dear Mi&s;s Howe.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Tue&s;day, March 21.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HOW willingly would my dear mamma &s;hew kindne&s;s to me, were &s;he permitted! None of this per&s;ecution &s;hould I labour under, I am &s;ure, if that regard were paid to her prudence and fine under|&s;tanding, which they &s;o well de&s;erve. Whether owe|ing to her, or to my aunt, or to both, that a new trial was to be made upon me, I cannot tell; but this morning her Shorey deliver'd into my hand the fol|lowing conde&s;cending letter.
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear girl,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FOR &s;o I mu&s;t &s;till call you; &s;ince <HI>dear</HI> you may be to me, in every &s;en&s;e of the word&mdash;We have taken into particular con&s;ideration, &s;ome hints that fell ye&s;terday from your good Norton, as if we had not, at Mr. Solmes's fir&s;t application, treated you with that conde&s;cen&s;ion, wherewith we have in all other in&s;tances treated you. If it <HI>had been &s;o,</HI> my dear, you were not excu&s;able to be wanting in <HI>your</HI> part, and to &s;et your&s;elf to oppo&s;e your father's will in a point he had enter'd too far into, to recede with honour.
<PB N="279" REF="292">
But all yet may be well. On your &s;ingle will, my child, depends all our pre&s;ent happine&s;s!&mdash;</P>
<P>Your father permits me to tell you, that if you now at la&s;t comply with his expectations, all pa&s;t di&s;|obligations &s;hall be bury'd in oblivion, as if they had never been: But withal, that this is the la&s;t time that that grace will be offer'd you.</P>
<P>I hinted to you, you mu&s;t remember, that patterns of the riche&s;t &s;ilks were &s;ent for. They are come: And as they <HI>are</HI> come, your papa, to &s;hew how much he is determin'd, will have me &s;end them up to you. I could have wi&s;h'd they might not have accompany'd this letter&mdash;But there is no great matter in <HI>that.</HI> I mu&s;t tell you, that your delicacy is not to be <HI>quite</HI> &s;o much regarded, as I had once thought it de&s;erved to be.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the newe&s;t, as well as riche&s;t, that we could procure; an&s;werable to our &s;tation in the world; an&s;werable to the fortune, additional to your grandfather's e&s;tate, de&s;igned you; and to the noble &s;ettlements agreed upon.</P>
<P>Your papa intends you &s;ix &s;uits (three of them dre&s;s'd) at his own expence. You have an intire new &s;uit; and one be&s;ides, which I think you never wore but twice. As the new &s;uit is rich, if you chu&s;e to make That one of the &s;ix, your papa, will pre&s;ent you with an hundred guineas in lieu.</P>
<P>Mr. Solmes intends to pre&s;ent you with a &s;et of jewels. As you have your grandmother's and your own, if you choo&s;e to have the former new-&s;et and to make them &s;erve, his pre&s;ent will be made in money; a very round &s;um&mdash;which will be given in full property to your&s;elf; be&s;ides a fine annual al|lowance for pin-money, as it is called. So that your objection again&s;t the &s;pirit of a man you think wor&s;e of than he de&s;erves, will have no weight; but you will be more independent than a wife of le&s;s di&s;cretion than we attribute to you, perhaps <HI>ought</HI> to be. You know full well, that I, who fir&s;t and la&s;t brought a
<PB N="280" REF="293">
&s;till larger fortune into the family, than you will carry to Mr. Solmes, had not a provi&s;ion made me of near This, that we have made for you.&mdash;Where people marry to their liking, terms are the lea&s;t things &s;tood upon.&mdash;Yet &s;hould I be &s;orry if you cannot, to oblige us all, overcome a di&s;like.</P>
<P>Wonder not, Clary, that I write to you thus plainly and freely upon this &s;ubject. Your behaviour hitherto has been &s;uch, that we have had no opportunity of entering minutely into the &s;ubject with you. Yet, after all that has pa&s;&s;ed between you and me in con|ver&s;ation, and between you and your uncles by letter, you have no room to doubt what is to be the con|&s;equence.&mdash;Either, child, we mu&s;t give up <HI>our</HI> au|thority, or you <HI>your</HI> humour. You cannot expect the one: We have all the rea&s;on in the world to ex|pect the other. You know I have told you more than once, that you mu&s;t re&s;olve to have Mr. Solmes, or never to be looked upon to be our child.</P>
<P>The draught of the &s;ettlements you may &s;ee when|ever you will. We think there can be no room for objection to any of the articles. There is &s;till more in them in our family's favour, than was &s;tipulated at fir&s;t, when your aunt talk'd of them to you. More &s;o, indeed, than we could have a&s;k'd. If, upon peru&s;al of them, you think any alteration nece&s;&s;ary, it &s;hall be made.&mdash;Do, my dear girl, &s;end to me within this day or two, or rather <HI>a&s;k</HI> me, for the peru&s;al of them.</P>
<P>As a certain per&s;on's appearance at church &s;o lately, and what he gives out every-where, make us ex|tremely unea&s;y, and as that unea&s;ine&s;s will continue while you are &s;ingle, you mu&s;t not wonder that a &s;hort day is intended. This-day-fortnight we de&s;ign it to be, if you have no objection to make, that I &s;hall approve of. But, if you determine as we would have you, and &s;ignify it to us, we &s;hall not &s;tand with you for a week or &s;o.</P>
<P>Your &s;ightline&s;s of per&s;on, may perhaps make &s;ome
<PB N="281" REF="294">
think this alliance di&s;paraging. But I hope you won't put &s;uch a per&s;onal value upon your&s;elf; if you do, it will indeed be the le&s;s wonder that <HI>per&s;on</HI> &s;hould weigh with you, (however contemptible the con|&s;ideration!)&mdash;in another man.&mdash;Thus we parents, in ju&s;tice, ought to judge: That our two daughters are <HI>equally</HI> dear and valuable to us: If &s;o, why &s;hould <HI>Clari&s;&s;a</HI> think that a di&s;paragement, which <HI>Arabella</HI> would not (nor we for her) have thought any, had the addre&s;s been made to her?&mdash;You will know what I mean by this, without my explaining my&s;elf further.</P>
<P>Signify to us, now, therefore, your compliance with our wi&s;hes.&mdash;And then there is an end of your confinement: An act of oblivion, as I may call it, &s;hall pa&s;s upon all your former refractorine&s;s: And you will once more make us happy in you, and in one another. You may, in this ca&s;e, directly come down to your papa and me, in his &s;tudy; where we will give you our opinions of the patterns, with our hearty forgivene&s;s and ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>Come, be a good child, as you u&s;ed to be, my Clari&s;&s;a. I have (notwith&s;tanding your pa&s;t behaviour, and the hopele&s;ne&s;s which &s;ome have expre&s;s'd of your compliance) undertaken this one time more for you. Di&s;credit not my hopes, my dear girl. I have promi&s;ed never more to interfere between your <HI>father</HI> and <HI>you,</HI> if this my mo&s;t earne&s;t application &s;ucceed not. I expect you down, Love. Your papa expects you down. But be &s;ure don't let him &s;ee any thing unchearful in your compliance. If you come, I will cla&s;p you to my fond heart, with as much plea&s;ure as ever I pre&s;s'd you to it in my whole life. You don't know what I have &s;uffer'd within the&s;e few weeks pa&s;t; nor ever will be able to gue&s;s, till you come to be in my &s;ituation; which is that of a fond and indulgent mother, praying night and day, and &s;truggling to pre&s;erve, again&s;t the attempts of more ungovernable &s;pirits, the peace and union of her family.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="295">But, you know the terms. Come not near us, if you re&s;olve to be undutiful: But this, after what I have written, I hope you cannot be.</P>
<P>If you come directly, and, as I &s;aid, <HI>chearfully,</HI> as if your heart were in your duty (and you told me it was <HI>free,</HI> you know&mdash;) I &s;hall then, as I &s;aid, give you the mo&s;t tender proofs, how much I am</P>

</LETTER></P>
<P>Think for me, my deare&s;t friend, how I mu&s;t be affected by this letter; the contents of it &s;o &s;urpri|&s;ingly terrifying, yet &s;o &s;weetly urged!&mdash;O why, cry'd I to my&s;elf, am I obliged to undergo this &s;evere conflict between a command that I cannot obey, and language &s;o conde&s;cendingly moving!&mdash;Could I have been &s;ure of being &s;truck dead at the altar before the ceremony had given the man I hate a title to my vows, I think I could have &s;ubmitted to have been led to it. But to think of living <HI>with,</HI> and living <HI>for,</HI> a man one cannot abide, what a &s;ad thing is that!&mdash;</P>
<P>And then, how could the glare of habit and orna|ment be &s;uppo&s;ed any inducement to one, who has always held, that the principal view of a good wife in the adorning of her per&s;on, ought to be, to <HI>pre&s;erve</HI> the affection of her hu&s;band, and to <HI>do credit</HI> to his choice; and that &s;he &s;hould be even <HI>fearful</HI> of attract|ing the eyes of <HI>others?</HI>&mdash;In this view, mu&s;t not the very richne&s;s of the patterns add to my di&s;gu&s;ts?&mdash;Great encouragement indeed, to think of adorning one's-&s;elf to be the wife of Mr. <HI>Solmes!</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it was not po&s;&s;ible for me to go down upon the pre&s;crib'd condition. Do you think it was?&mdash;And to <HI>write,</HI> if my letter would have been <HI>read,</HI> what could I write that would be admitted, and after what I had written and &s;aid to &s;o little effect? I walked backward and forward: I threw down with di&s;dain the patterns: Now to my clo&s;et retir'd I; then, quitting it, now threw I my&s;elf upon the Settee; now
<PB N="283" REF="296">
upon this chair; now upon that; and then into one window, then into another&mdash;I knew not what to do!&mdash;And while I was in this &s;u&s;pen&s;e, having again taken up the letter to re-peru&s;e it, Betty came in, reminding me, by order, That my papa and mamma waited for me in my papa's &s;tudy.</P>
<P>Tell my mamma, &s;aid I, that I beg the favour of &s;eeing her here for one moment; or to permit me to attend her any where by her&s;elf.</P>
<P>I li&s;ten'd at the &s;tair's-head&mdash;You &s;ee, my dear, how it is, cry'd my father, very angrily: All your conde&s;cen&s;ion (as your indulgence heretofore) is thrown away. <HI>You blame your &s;on's violence,</HI> as you call it, [I had &s;ome plea&s;ure in hearing this] but nothing el&s;e will do with her. You &s;hall <HI>not</HI> &s;ee her alone. Is <HI>my</HI> pre&s;ence an exception to the bold creature?</P>
<P>Tell her, &s;aid my mamma to Betty, &s;he knows up|on what terms &s;he may come down to us. Nor will I &s;ee her upon any other.</P>
<P>The maid brought me this an&s;wer. I had recour&s;e to my pen and ink; but I trembled &s;o, that I could not write, nor knew I what to &s;ay had I had &s;teadier fingers. At la&s;t Betty brought me the&s;e lines from my papa.

<P>I &s;aid to Betty, who brought me his me&s;&s;age, Let him re&s;tore a lo&s;t creature to her father and mother, and then I may hear what he has to &s;ay. But, if my friends will not &s;ee <HI>me</HI> on <HI>his</HI> account, I will not &s;ee him upon his <HI>own.</HI></P>

<P>AN angry dialogue, a &s;colding-bout rather, has pa&s;&s;ed between my &s;i&s;ter and me. Did you think I could &s;cold, my dear?</P>
<P>She was &s;ent up to me, upon my refu&s;al to &s;ee Mr. Solmes&mdash;Let loo&s;e upon me, I think!&mdash;No intention, on their parts, to conciliate! I am to be given up to my brother and her I &s;uppo&s;e, by general con&s;ent.</P>
<P>Every thing &s;he &s;aid again&s;t me, which carried force with it, I will do ju&s;tice to. As I a&s;k for your approbation or di&s;approbation of my conduct, upon the facts I lay before you, I &s;hould think it the &s;ign of a very bad cau&s;e, if I endeavoured to mi&s;lead my judge.</P>
<P>She began with repre&s;enting to me the danger I had been in, had my father come up, as he would have done, had he not been hindered, by Mr. <HI>Solmes,</HI> among the re&s;t. She reflected upon my good Mrs. Norton, as if &s;he encouraged me in my perver&s;ene&s;s. She ridiculed me for my &s;uppo&s;ed e&s;teem for Love|lace. Was &s;urpri&s;ed that the <HI>witty,</HI> the <HI>prudent,</HI> nay, the <HI>dutiful</HI> and <HI>pi-ous</HI> (&s;o &s;he &s;neeringly pronounced the word) Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe, &s;hould be &s;o &s;trangely fond of a profligate man, that her parents were forced to lock her up, to keep her from running into his arms. Let me a&s;k you, my dear, &s;aid &s;he, how you now keep your account of the di&s;po&s;ition of your time? How many hours in the twenty-four do you devote to your Needle? How many to your Prayers? How many to Letter-writing? And how many to Love?&mdash;I doubt, I doubt, my little dear, was her arch expre&s;&s;ion, The latter article is like Aaron's rod, and &s;wallows up all the re&s;t!&mdash;Tell me; is it not &s;o?</P>
<P>To the&s;e I an&s;wered, That it was a double mor|tification to me to owe my &s;afety from my papa's in|dignation
<PB N="287" REF="300">
to a man I could never thank for any thing.&mdash;I vindicated the good Mrs. Norton with a warmth that her merit required from me.&mdash;With equal warmth I re&s;ented her un&s;i&s;terly reflections upon me on Mr. Lovelace's account. As to the di&s;po&s;ition of my time, in the twenty-four hours, I told her it would better have become her to pity a &s;i&s;ter in di|&s;tre&s;s, than to exult over her&mdash;E&s;pecially, when I could too ju&s;tly attribute to the di&s;po&s;ition of &s;ome of her wakeful hours no &s;mall part of that di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>She raved extremely at this la&s;t hint: But reminded me of the gentle treatment of all my friends, my mamma's particularly, before it came to This: She &s;aid, that I had di&s;covered a &s;pirit they never had ex|pected: That, if they had <HI>thought</HI> me &s;uch a cham|pione&s;s, they would hardly have ventured to engage with me: But that now, the &s;hort and the long was, that the matter had gone too far to be given up: That now it was a contention between <HI>duty</HI> and <HI>wil|fulne&s;s</HI>; Whether a parent's authority was to yield to a daughter's ob&s;tinacy, or the contrary: That I mu&s;t therefore bend or break, that was all, child.</P>
<P>I told her, that I wi&s;hed the &s;ubject were of &s;uch a nature, that I could return her plea&s;antry with equal lightne&s;s of heart: But that, if Mr. Solmes had &s;uch merit in every-body's eye, in <HI>hers</HI> particularly, why might he not be a <HI>brother</HI> to me, rather than a <HI>hu&s;band?</HI></P>
<P>O child, &s;he thought I was as plea&s;ant to the full as &s;he was: She began to have &s;ome hopes of me now. But did I think &s;he would rob her &s;i&s;ter of her humble &s;ervant? Had he fir&s;t addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me, &s;aid &s;he, &s;omething might have been &s;aid: But to take my younger &s;i&s;ter's refu&s;al! No, no, child; it is not come to that neither!

<P>Did not this de&s;erve a &s;evere return? Do, &s;ay it did, to ju&s;tify my reply.&mdash;Alas! for my poor &s;i&s;ter! &s;aid I.&mdash;The man was not <HI>always</HI> &s;o great a profligate. How true is the ob&s;ervation, <HI>That unrequited love turns to deepe&s;t hate!</HI></P>
<P>I thought &s;he would have beat me.&mdash;But I pro|ceeded&mdash;I have heard often of my brother's danger, and my brother's murderer. When &s;o little ceremony is made with me, why &s;hould I not &s;peak out?&mdash;Did he not &s;eek to kill the <HI>other,</HI> if he could have done it? Would <HI>he</HI> have given him <HI>his</HI> life, had it been in his power?&mdash;The <HI>aggre&s;&s;or</HI> &s;hould not <HI>complain.</HI>&mdash;And, as to oppor-<HI>tune</HI> offers, would to heaven &s;ome one had offer'd oppor-<HI>tune</HI>-ly to &s;omebody. It is not my fault, Bella, the oppor-<HI>tune</HI> gentleman don't come!</P>
<P>Could <HI>you,</HI> my dear, have &s;hewn more <HI>&s;pirit?</HI> I expected to feel the weight of her hand. She did come up to me, with it held up: Then, &s;peechle&s;s with pa&s;&s;ion, ran down half way of the &s;tairs, and then up again.</P>
<P>When &s;he could &s;peak&mdash;God give her patience with me!</P>
<P>Amen, &s;aid I: But you &s;ee, Bella, how ill you bear the retort you provoke. Will you forgive me; and let me find a &s;i&s;ter in you, as <HI>I</HI> am &s;orry, if you have rea&s;on to think me un&s;i&s;terly in what I have &s;aid?</P>
<P>Then did &s;he pour upon me, with greater violence; con&s;idering my gentlene&s;s as a triumph of temper over

her. She was re&s;olved, &s;he &s;aid, to let every-body know how I took the wicked Lovelace's part again&s;t my brother.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h'd, I told her, I could make the plea for <HI>my</HI>-&s;elf, which &s;he might for <HI>her</HI>-&s;elf: That my anger was more inexcu&s;able than my judgment. But I pre|&s;umed &s;he had &s;ome other view in coming to me, than &s;he had hitherto acquainted me with. Let me, &s;aid I, but know (after all that has pa&s;&s;ed) if you have anything to propo&s;e that I <HI>can</HI> comply with; any thing that can make my <HI>only</HI> &s;i&s;ter once more my friend?</P>
<P>I had before, upon her ridiculing me on my &s;up|po&s;ed character of <HI>meekne&s;s,</HI> &s;aid, that, altho' I wi&s;hed to be thought <HI>meek,</HI> I would not be <HI>abject</HI>; altho' <HI>humble,</HI> not <HI>mean:</HI> And here, in a &s;neering way, &s;he cautioned me on that head.</P>
<P>I replied, that her plea&s;antry was much more agree|able than her anger: But I wi&s;hed &s;he would let me know the end of a vi&s;it that had hitherto <HI>(between</HI> us) been &s;o un&s;i&s;terly?</P>
<P>She de&s;ired to be informed, in the name of <HI>every|body,</HI> was her word, what I was determined upon: And whether to comply or not?&mdash;One word for all: My friends were not to have patience with &s;o perver&s;e a creature, for ever.</P>
<P>This then I told her I would do: Ab&s;olutely break with the man they were all &s;o determined again&s;t: Upon condition, however, that neither Mr. Solmes, nor any other, were urged to me with the force of a command.</P>
<P>And what was this, more than I had offered be|fore? What, but ringing my changes upon the &s;ame bells, and neither receding nor advancing one tittle?</P>
<P>If I knew what other propo&s;als I could make, that would be acceptable to them all, and free me from the addre&s;s of a man &s;o di&s;agreeable to me, I would make them. I had indeed before offered, never to marry without my father's con&s;ent&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="303">She interrupted me, That was becau&s;e I depended upon my whining tricks to bring my father and mo|ther to what I plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>A <HI>poor</HI> dependence! I &s;aid:&mdash;She knew tho&s;e who would make that dependence vain&mdash;</P>
<P>And I <HI>&s;hould</HI> have brought them to my own beck, very probably, and my uncle Harlowe too, as al&s;o my aunt Hervey, had I not been forbidden their &s;ight, and thereby hindered from playing my pug's tricks before them.</P>
<P>At lea&s;t, Bella, &s;aid I, you have hinted to me to whom I am obliged, that my father and mother, and every-body el&s;e, treat me thus har&s;hly. But &s;urely you make them all very weak. Indifferent per&s;ons, judging of us two, from what <HI>you</HI> &s;ay, would either think <HI>me</HI> a very artful creature, or <HI>you</HI> a very &s;piteful one.</P>
<P>You are <HI>indeed</HI> a very artful one, for that matter, interrupted &s;he in a pa&s;&s;ion: One of the artfulle&s;t I every knew! And then followed an accu&s;ation &s;o low! &s;o un&s;i&s;terly!&mdash;That I next-to-bewitch'd people, by my in&s;inuating addre&s;s: That no-body could be va|lued or re&s;pected, but mu&s;t &s;tand like cyphers where|ever I came. How often, &s;aid &s;he, have I and my brother been talking upon a &s;ubject, and had every|body's attention, till <HI>you</HI> came in, with your bewitch|ing <HI>meek</HI> pride, and <HI>humble</HI> &s;ignificance; and then have we either been &s;topped by references to Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a's opinion, for&s;ooth; or been forced to &s;top our&s;elves, or mu&s;t have talked on unattended to by every-body.</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed. Dear Bella, proceed!&mdash;She indeed &s;eemed only gathering breath.</P>
<P>And &s;o I will, &s;aid &s;he. Did you not bewitch my grandfather? Could any thing be plea&s;ing to him, that <HI>you</HI> did not &s;ay or do? How did he u&s;e to hang, till he &s;labber'd again, poor doting old man! on your &s;ilver tongue! Yet what did <HI>you</HI> &s;ay, that <HI>we</HI> could not have &s;aid?

<P>This was too low too move me: O my poor &s;i&s;ter! &s;aid I: Not to be able, or at lea&s;t willing, to di&s;tin|gui&s;h between art and nature!

You know, Bella, that the e&s;tate my grandfather bequeathed <HI>me</HI> was not half the real e&s;tate he left.</P>
<P>What's all that to an e&s;tate in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and left you with &s;uch di&s;tinctions, as gave you a reputation of greater value than the e&s;tate it&s;elf?</P>
<P>Hence my misfortune, Bella, in your Envy, I doubt! But have I not given up that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in the be&s;t manner I could&mdash;</P>

<P>Ob&s;tinate heart, Bella!</P>
<P>Yes, ob&s;tinate heart! For did you ever give up any thing? Had you not the art to make them think all was right you a&s;ked, tho' my brother and I were fre|quently refu&s;ed favours of no greater import?</P>
<P>I knew not, Bella, that I ever a&s;ked any thing un|fit to be granted. I &s;eldom a&s;ked favours for <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> but for <HI>others.</HI></P>
<P>I was a reflecting creature for this!</P>
<P>All you &s;peak of, Bella, was a long time ago. I cannot go &s;o far back into our childi&s;h follies. Little did I think of how long &s;tanding this your late-&s;hewn antipathy is.</P>
<P>I was a reflecter again! Such a <HI>&s;aucy meekne&s;s</HI>; &s;uch a <HI>be&s;t manner</HI>; and &s;uch venom in words!&mdash;O Clary! Clary! Thou wert always a <HI>two-faced</HI> girl!</P>
<P>No-body thought I had two faces, when I gave up All into my papa's management; taking from his bounty, as before, all my little pocket-money, with|out a &s;hilling addition to my &s;tipend, or de&s;iring it&mdash;</P>
<P>Yes, cunning creature!&mdash;And that was another of your <HI>fetches!</HI>&mdash;For did it not engage my fond papa (as no doubt you thought it would) to tell you, that, &s;ince you had done &s;o grateful and dutiful a thing, he would keep intire, for your u&s;e, all the produce of the e&s;tate left you, and be but your &s;teward in it; and that you &s;hould be intitled to the &s;ame allowances as before: Another of your <HI>hook-in's,</HI> Clary!&mdash;So that all your extravagancies have been &s;upported gratis.</P>
<P>My extravagancies, Bella!&mdash;But did my papa ever give me any-thing he did not give you?</P>
<P>Yes, indeed; I got more by that means, than I &s;hould have had the con&s;cience to a&s;k. But I have &s;till the greater part to &s;hew! But <HI>you!</HI> What have <HI>you</HI> to &s;hew?&mdash;I dare to &s;ay, not fifty pieces in the world!</P>

<P>Unworthy Bella!&mdash;The good woman, altho' low in circum&s;tance, is great in mind! Much greater than tho&s;e who would impute meanne&s;s to a &s;oul incapable of it.</P>
<P>What then have you done with the &s;ums given you from infancy to &s;quander?&mdash;Let me a&s;k you (affect|ing archne&s;s), Has, has, has, Lovelace, has your Rake, put it out at intere&s;t for you?</P>

<P>None of my &s;aucy contempts (ri&s;ing in her voice): None of my <HI>poor Bella's,</HI> with that air of &s;uperiority in a younger &s;i&s;ter!</P>

<P>I mu&s;t let you talk in your own way, or we &s;hall never come to a point. I &s;hall not matter his <HI>roar|ing,</HI> as you call it: I will promi&s;e him, that, if I ever marry any other man, it &s;hall not be till <HI>he</HI> is mar|ried.

<P>Let me a&s;k you, child, if you will give your pretty propo&s;al in writing?</P>

<P>She own'd, That &s;he came to expo&s;tulate with me, for the peace &s;ake of the family: For that &s;he could not believe it po&s;&s;ible, if I did not conceive my&s;elf un|kindly treated, that I, who had ever &s;hewn &s;uch a &s;weetne&s;s of temper, as well as manners, &s;hould be thus re&s;olute, in a point &s;o <HI>very near</HI> to my father, and all my friends. My mamma and &s;he were both willing to impute my re&s;olution to the manner I had been begun with; and to my &s;uppo&s;ing, that my bro|ther had originally more of a hand in the propo&s;als made by Mr. Solmes, than my father, or other friends. And fain would &s;he have furni&s;h'd me with an excu&s;e to come off of my oppo&s;ition; Bella all the while humming a tune, and opening this book and that, without meaning; but &s;aying nothing. After having &s;hewed me, that my oppo&s;ition could not be of &s;igni|fication,
<PB N="299" REF="312">
my father's honour being engaged, &s;he con|cluded with inforcing upon me my duty, in &s;tronger terms than I believe &s;he would have done, the circum|&s;tances of the ca&s;e con&s;ider'd, had not my &s;i&s;ter been pre&s;ent. It would but be repeating what I have &s;o often mentioned, to give you the arguments that pa&s;&s;ed on both &s;ides. So I will only recite what &s;he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that carried with it the face of newne&s;s.</P>
<P>When &s;he found me inflexible, as &s;he was plea&s;ed to call it, &s;he &s;aid&mdash;For her part, &s;he could not but &s;ay, that if I were not to have either Mr. Solmes or Mr. Lovelace, and yet, to make my friends ea&s;y, mu&s;t marry, &s;he &s;hould not think ami&s;s of Mr. Wyerley. What did I think of Mr. Wyerley?</P>
<P>Ay, Clary, put in my &s;i&s;ter, what &s;ay you to Mr. Wyerley?</P>
<P>I &s;aw thro' this immediately. It was &s;aid on pur|po&s;e, I doubted not, to have an argument again&s;t me of ab&s;olute prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in Lovelace's favour: Since Mr. Wyerley every-where proclaims his value, even to veneration, for me; and is far le&s;s exception|able, both in per&s;on and mind, than Mr. Solmes: And I was willing to turn the tables, by trying how far Solme's terms might be di&s;pens'd with; &s;ince the &s;ame terms could not be expected from Mr. Wyerley?</P>
<P>I therefore de&s;ired to know, Whether my an&s;wer, if it &s;hould be in favour of Mr. Wyerley, would re|lea&s;e me from Mr. Solmes?&mdash;For I own'd, that I had not the aver&s;ion to <HI>him,</HI> that I had to the <HI>other.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, &s;he had no commi&s;&s;ion to propo&s;e &s;uch a thing&mdash;She only knew, that my papa and mamma would not be ea&s;y till Mr. Lovelace's hopes were in|tirely defeated.</P>
<P>Cunning creature! &s;aid my &s;i&s;ter.&mdash;And this, and her joining in the que&s;tion-before, confirm'd me, that it was a de&s;igned &s;nare for me.</P>
<P>Don't YOU, dear Madam, &s;aid I, put que&s;tions that can an&s;wer no end, but to &s;upport my brother's

&s;chemes again&s;t me.&mdash;But are there any hopes of an end to my &s;ufferings and di&s;grace, without having this hated man impo&s;ed upon me? Will not what I have offer'd be accepted? I am &s;ure it ought: I will ven|ture to &s;ay That.</P>
<P>Why, niece, if there be <HI>not</HI> any &s;uch hopes, I pre|&s;ume you don't think your&s;elf ab&s;olv'd from the duty due from a child to her parents?</P>
<P>Yes, &s;aid my &s;i&s;ter, I do not doubt but it is Mi&s;s Clary's aim, if &s;he does not fly to her Lovelace, to get her e&s;tate into her own hands, and go to live at <HI>The Grove,</HI> in that independence upon which &s;he builds all her perver&s;ene&s;s. And, dear heart! my little love, how will you then blaze away! Your mamma Norton your oracle, with your Poor at your gates, mingling &s;o <HI>proudly</HI> and &s;o <HI>meanly</HI> with the rag|ged herd! Reflecting, by your o&s;tentation, upon all the Ladies in the county, who do not as you do. This is known to be your &s;cheme! And the Poor <HI>without</HI>-doors, and Lovelace <HI>within,</HI> with one hand building up a name, pulling it down with the other!&mdash;O what a charming &s;cheme is this!&mdash;But let me tell you, my pretty little frighty one, that my papa's <HI>living</HI> Will &s;hall controul my grandfather's <HI>dead</HI> one; and That e&s;tate will be di&s;po&s;ed of as my fond grandfather would have di&s;po&s;ed of it, had he lived to &s;ee &s;uch a change in his favourite. In a word, Mi&s;s, it will be kept out of your hands, till my papa &s;ees you di&s;creet enough to have the management of it, or till you can <HI>dutifully,</HI> by Law, tear it from him.</P>
<P>Fie, Mi&s;s Harlowe, &s;aid my aunt, this is not pretty to your &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>O Madam, let her go on. This is nothing to what I have borne from Mi&s;s Harlowe. She is either commi&s;&s;ioned to treat me ill by her <HI>envy,</HI> or by an <HI>higher</HI> authority, to which I mu&s;t &s;ubmit.&mdash;As to revoking the e&s;tate, what hinders, if I plea&s;ed? I know my power; but have not the lea&s;t thought of
<PB N="301" REF="314">
exerting it. Be plea&s;ed to let my papa know, that, whatever be the con&s;equences to my&s;elf, were he to turn me out of doors (which I &s;hould rather he would, than to be confined and in&s;ulted as I am), and were I to be reduced to indigence and want, I would &s;eek no re&s;ources, that &s;hould be contrary to his will.</P>
<P>For that matter, child, &s;aid my aunt, were you to marry, you mu&s;t do as your <HI>hu&s;band</HI> will have you. If that hu&s;band be Mr. Lovelace, he will be glad of any opportunity of embroiling the families more. And let me tell you, niece, if he had the re&s;pect for you he pretends to have, he would not be upon &s;uch de|fiances as he is. He is known to be a very revenge|ful man; and were I <HI>you,</HI> Mi&s;s Clary, I &s;hould be afraid he would wreak upon me that vengeance, tho' I had not offended him, which he is continually threaten|ing to pour upon the family.</P>
<P>Mr. Lovelace's threaten'd vengeance is in <HI>return</HI> for threaten'd vengeance. It is not every-body will bear in&s;ult, as, of late, I have been forced to bear it.</P>
<P>O how my &s;i&s;ter's face &s;hone with pa&s;&s;ion!</P>
<P>But Mr. Lovelace, proceeded I, as I have &s;aid twenty and twenty times, would be quite out of the que&s;tion, were I to be generou&s;ly treated!</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter &s;aid &s;omething with great vehemence: But only rai&s;ing my voice, to be heard, without minding her, Pray, Madam, provokingly interrogated I, was he not known to have been as wild a man, when he was <HI>at fir&s;t</HI> introduced into our family, as he <HI>now</HI> is &s;aid to be? Yet <HI>then,</HI> the common phra&s;es of <HI>wild oats,</HI> and <HI>black oxen,</HI> and &s;uch-like, were qualifiers; and marriage, and the wi&s;e's di&s;cretion, were to perform wonders&mdash;But (turning to my &s;i&s;ter) I find I have &s;ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> too much.</P>
<P>O thou wicked reflecter!&mdash;And what made <HI>me</HI> ab|hor him, think you, but the proof of tho&s;e villainous freedoms that ought to have had the &s;ame effect upon you, were you but half &s;o good a creature as you pretend to be?</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="315"><HI>Proof,</HI> did you &s;ay, Bella! I thought you had not <HI>proof?</HI>&mdash;But <HI>you know be&s;t.</HI> [Was not this very &s;pite|ful, my dear?]</P>
<P>Now, Clary, would I give a thou&s;and pounds to know all that is in thy little rancorous and reflecting heart, at this moment.</P>
<P>I might let you know for a much le&s;s &s;um, and not be afraid of being wor&s;e treated than I have been.</P>
<P>Well, young Ladies, I am &s;orry to &s;ee things run &s;o high between you. You know, niece (to me), you had not been confined thus to your apartment, could your mamma by conde&s;cen&s;ions, or your papa by authority, have been able to have done any thing with you. But how can you expect, when there mu&s;t be a conce&s;&s;ion on <HI>one</HI> &s;ide, that it &s;hould be on theirs? If <HI>my</HI> Dolly, who has not the hundredth part of your under&s;tanding, were thus to &s;et her&s;elf up in ab&s;olute contradiction to my will, in a point <HI>&s;o</HI> material, I &s;hould not take it well of her&mdash;Indeed I &s;hould not.</P>
<P>I believe not, Madam: And if Mi&s;s Hervey had ju&s;t &s;uch a brother, and ju&s;t &s;uch a &s;i&s;ter (you <HI>may</HI> look, Bella!)&mdash;and if both were to aggravate her parents, as my brother and &s;i&s;ter do mine&mdash;Then, perhaps, you might u&s;e her as I am u&s;ed: And if &s;he hated the man you propo&s;ed to her, and with as much rea&s;on as I do Mr. Solmes&mdash;</P>
<P>[And loved a Rake and Libertine, Mi&s;s, as you do Lovelace, &s;aid my &s;i&s;ter&mdash;]</P>
<P>Then might &s;he (continued I, not minding her) beg to be excu&s;ed from obeying. But yet if &s;he did, and would give you the mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;urances, and &s;ecurity be&s;ides, that &s;he never would have the man you di&s;liked, again&s;t your con&s;ent&mdash;I dare &s;ay, Mi&s;s Hervey's father and mother would &s;it down &s;atisfy'd, and not endeavour to force her inclinations.</P>
<P>So!&mdash;&s;aid my &s;i&s;ter, with uplifted hands, <HI>father</HI> and <HI>mother</HI> now come in for their &s;hare!</P>
<P>But if, child, reply'd my aunt, I knew &s;he <HI>loved
<PB N="303" REF="316">
a Rake,</HI> and &s;u&s;pected, that &s;he &s;ought only to gain time, in order to wire-draw me into a con&s;ent&mdash;</P>
<P>I beg pardon, Madam, for interrupting you; but if Mi&s;s Hervey could <HI>obtain</HI> your con&s;ent, what fur|ther would be to be &s;aid?</P>
<P>True, child; but &s;he never &s;hould.</P>
<P>Then, Madam, it never would be.</P>
<P>That I doubt, niece.</P>
<P>If you do, Madam, can you think confinement and ill u&s;age is the way to prevent the apprehended ra&s;hne&s;s?</P>
<P>My dear, this &s;ort of intimation would make one but too apprehen&s;ive, that there is no tru&s;ting to your&s;elf, when one knows your inclination.</P>
<P>That apprehen&s;ion, Madam, &s;eems to have been conceived before this intimation was made, or the lea&s;t cau&s;e for it given. Why el&s;e the di&s;graceful confine|ment I have been laid under?&mdash;Let me venture to &s;ay, that my &s;ufferings are rather owing to <HI>de&s;igned</HI> terror, knowing there were too good grounds for my oppo&s;ition, than doubt of my conduct; for, when they were inflicted upon me fir&s;t, I had given no <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of doubt; nor &s;hould there now be room for any, if my di&s;cretion might be tru&s;ted to.</P>
<P>My aunt, after a little he&s;itation, &s;aid, But, con|&s;ider, my dear, what confu&s;ion will be perpetuated in your family, if you marry this hated Lovelace?</P>
<P>And, let it be con&s;idered, what mi&s;ery to me, Ma|dam, if I marry that hated Solmes?</P>
<P>Many a young creature has thought &s;he could not love a man, with whom &s;he has afterwards been very happy. Few women, child, marry their fir&s;t loves.</P>
<P>That may be the rea&s;on there are &s;o few happy marriages.</P>
<P>But there are few fir&s;t-impre&s;&s;ions <HI>fit</HI> to be encou|raged.</P>
<P>I am afraid &s;o too, Madam. I have a very indif|ferent opinion of light and fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions. But, as I have often &s;aid, all I wi&s;h for is, to have leave to live <HI>&s;ingle.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="317">Indeed you mu&s;t not, Mi&s;s.

<P>I know no better way to prevent mi&s;chief on all &s;ides, I freely own it&mdash;And there is not, if <HI>he</HI> be out of the que&s;tion, another man in the world, I can think favourably of.&mdash;Neverthele&s;s, I would give all I have in the world, that he were marry'd to &s;ome other per&s;on&mdash;Indeed I would, Bella, for all you put on that &s;mile of incredulity.</P>

<P>MY heart fluttered with the hope and the fear of &s;eeing my mamma, and with the &s;hame and the grief of having given her &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s. But it needed not: She was not permitted to come. But my aunt was &s;o good as to return; yet not without my &s;i&s;ter: And, taking my hand, made me &s;it down by her.</P>

<P>She then &s;et forth to me, my friends expectations from me; Mr. Solmes's riches (three times as rich he came out to be as any-body had thought him); the &s;et|tlements propo&s;ed; Mr. Lovelace's bad character; their aver&s;ion to him; all in a very &s;trong light; but not a &s;tronger, than my mamma had before placed them in.

your judgment on your own account: And <HI>I</HI> had been happy, as well as <HI>you!</HI>&mdash;Was it my fault, I pray you, that it was not &s;o?&mdash;O how &s;he rav'd!</P>
<P>To be &s;o ready to <HI>give,</HI> Bella, and &s;o loth to <HI>take,</HI> is not very fair in you.</P>
<P>The poor Bella de&s;cended to call names.</P>
<P>Why, &s;i&s;ter, &s;aid I, you are as angry, as if there were more in the hint, than po&s;&s;ibly might be de|&s;igned. My wi&s;h is &s;incere, for both our &s;akes!&mdash;for the whole family's &s;ake!&mdash;And what (good now) is there in it?&mdash;Do not, do not, dear Bella, give me cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect, that I have found a rea&s;on for your un&s;i&s;terly behaviour to me; and which till now was wholly unaccountable from &s;i&s;ter to &s;i&s;ter&mdash;</P>
<P>Fie, fie, Mi&s;s Clary! &s;aid my aunt.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter was more and more outrageous.</P>
<P>O how much fitter, &s;aid I, to be a <HI>je&s;t,</HI> than a <HI>je&s;ter!</HI>&mdash;But now, Bella, turn the gla&s;s to you, and &s;ee how poorly &s;its the robe upon your own &s;houlders, which you have been &s;o unmercifully fixing upon mine!</P>
<P>Fie, fie, Mi&s;s Clary! repeated my aunt.</P>
<P>And fie, fie, likewi&s;e, good Madam, to Mi&s;s Har|lowe, you would &s;ay, were you to have heard her barbarous in&s;ults upon me!</P>
<P>Let us go, Madam, &s;aid my &s;i&s;ter, with great violence; let us leave the creature to &s;well till &s;he bur&s;ts with her own poi&s;on.&mdash;The la&s;t time I will ever come near her, in the mind I am in!</P>
<P>It is &s;o ea&s;y a thing, return'd I, were I to be mean enough to follow an example that is &s;o cen|&s;ureable in the &s;etter of it, to vanqui&s;h &s;uch a teazing &s;pirit as yours, with its own blunt weapons, that I am amaz'd you will provoke me!&mdash;Yet, Bella, &s;ince you <HI>will</HI> go (for &s;he had hurry'd to the door), for|give me: I do you. And you have a double rea&s;on to do &s;o, both from elder&s;hip, and the offence &s;o &s;tu|diou&s;ly given to one in affliction.&mdash;But may <HI>you</HI> be happy, tho' <HI>I</HI> never &s;hall!&mdash;May <HI>you</HI> never have half

the trials <HI>I</HI> have had! Be this your comfort, that you cannot have a &s;i&s;ter to treat <HI>you,</HI> as you have treated <HI>me!</HI> And &s;o God ble&s;s you!</P>
<P>O thou art a&mdash;And down &s;he flung without &s;ay|ing what.</P>
<P>Permit me, Madam, &s;aid I to my aunt, &s;inking down, and cla&s;ping her knees with my arms, to de|tain you one moment&mdash;Not to &s;ay any thing about my poor &s;i&s;ter&mdash;She is her own puni&s;her&mdash;Only to thank you for all your conde&s;cending goodne&s;s to me. I only beg of you, not to impute to ob&s;tinacy the immoveablene&s;s I have &s;hewn to &s;o tender a friend; and to forgive me every thing I have &s;aid or done ami&s;s in your pre&s;ence: For it has not proceeded from inward rancour to the poor Bella. But I will be bold to &s;ay, that neither She, nor my Brother, nor even my Father him&s;elf, knows what a heart they have &s;et a bleeding.</P>
<P>I &s;aw, to my comfort, what effect my &s;i&s;ter's ab|&s;ence wrought for me.&mdash;Ri&s;e, my noble-minded niece!&mdash;charming creature!&mdash;[Tho&s;e were her kind words] kneel not to me!&mdash;Keep to your&s;elf what I now &s;ay to you: I admire you more than I can ex|pre&s;s&mdash;And if you can forbear claiming your e&s;tate, and can re&s;olve to avoid Lovelace, you will continue to be the greate&s;t miracle I ever knew at your years.&mdash;But I mu&s;t ha&s;ten down after your &s;i&s;ter.&mdash;The&s;e are my la&s;t words to you: Conform to your father's will, if you po&s;&s;ibly can. How meritorious will it be in you to do &s;o! Pray to God to <HI>enable</HI> you to con|form. You don't know what may be done.</P>
<P>Only, my dear aunt, one word, <HI>one</HI> word more (for &s;he was going)&mdash;Speak up all you can for my dear Mrs. Norton. She is but low in the world: Should ill health overtake her, &s;he may not know how to live without my mamma's favour. I &s;hall have no means to help her; for I will want nece&s;&s;aries before I will a&s;&s;ert my right: And I do a&s;&s;ure you,

&s;he has &s;aid &s;o many things to me in behalf of my re|&s;igning to my father's will, that her arguments have not a little contributed to make me re&s;olve to avoid the extremities, which neverthele&s;s I pray to God they do not at la&s;t force me upon. And yet they deprive me of her advice, and think unju&s;tly of one of the mo&s;t excellent of women.</P>
<P>I am glad to hear you &s;ay This: And take <HI>This,</HI> and <HI>This,</HI> and <HI>This,</HI> my charming niece (for &s;o &s;he call'd me at every word almo&s;t); ki&s;&s;ing me earne&s;tly, and cla&s;ping her arms about my neck: And God protect you, and direct you! But you <HI>mu&s;t</HI> &s;ubmit: Indeed you <HI>mu&s;t.</HI> Some <HI>one day</HI> in a month from <HI>This,</HI> is all the choice that is left you.</P>
<P>And this, I &s;uppo&s;e, was the doom my &s;i&s;ter call'd for; yet not wor&s;e than what had been pronounced upon me before.</P>
<P>She repeated the&s;e la&s;t &s;entences louder than the former. And remember, Mi&s;s, added &s;he, it is your <HI>duty</HI> to comply&mdash;And down &s;he went, leaving me with my heart full, and my eyes runing over.</P>
<P>The very repetition of this, fills me with almo&s;t equal concern, to that which I felt at the time. I can write no more; mi&s;tine&s;&s;es of all the colours in the rainbow twinkling upon my deluged eye.</P>

<P>I WILL add a few lines&mdash;My aunt, as &s;he went down from me, was met at the foot of the &s;tairs by my &s;i&s;ter, who &s;eemed to think &s;he had &s;tay'd a good while after her: And hearing her la&s;t words pre&s;cribing to me implicit duty, prai&s;ed her for it, and exclaim'd again&s;t my ob&s;tinacy, with, Did you ever hear of &s;uch per|ver&s;ene&s;s, Madam?
