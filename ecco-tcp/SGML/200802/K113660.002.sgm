<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The hi&s;tory of a philo&s;ophic vagabond, pur&s;uing novelty, but lo&s;ing content.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFTER we had &s;upped, Mrs. Arnold politely offered to &s;end a couple of her footmen for my &s;on's baggage, which he at fir&s;t &s;eemed to decline; but upon her pre&s;&s;ing the reque&s;t, he was obliged to inform her, that a &s;tick and a wallet were all the moveable things upon this earth that he could boa&s;t of. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why, aye my &s;on,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you left me but poor, and poor I find you are come back; and yet I make no doubt you have &s;een a great deal of the world."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Yes, Sir,"</Q> replied my &s;on, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but travel|ling after fortune, is not the way to &s;e|cure
<PB N="2" REF="4">
her; and, indeed, of late, I have de&s;i&s;ted from the pur&s;uit."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I fancy, Sir,"</Q> cried Mrs. Arnold, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the ac|count of your adventures would be amu|&s;ing: the fir&s;t part of them I have often heard from my niece; but could the company prevail for the re&s;t, it would be an additional obligation."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Madam,"</Q> replied my &s;on, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I can promi&s;e you the plea&s;ure you have in hearing, will not be half &s;o great as my vanity in the recital; and yet in the whole narrative I can &s;carce promi&s;e you one adventure, as my account is not of what I did, but what I &s;aw. The fir&s;t misfortune of my life, which you all know, was great; but tho' it di&s;tre&s;t, it could not &s;ink me. No per&s;on ever had a better knack at hoping than I. The le&s;s kind I found fortune then, the more I expected from her another time, and being now at the bottom of her wheel, every new revolution might lift, but could not depre&s;s me. I proceeded, therefore, towards London in a fine
<PB N="3" REF="5">
morning, no way unea&s;y about to-mor|row, but chearful as the birds that caroll'd by the road. I comforted my&s;elf with various reflections, that London was the true mart where abilities of every kind were &s;ure of meeting di&s;tinction and reward.<P>"Upon my arrival in town, Sir, my fir&s;t care was to deliver your letter of recom|mendation to our cou&s;in, who was him&s;elf in little better circum&s;tances than me. My fir&s;t &s;cheme, you know, Sir, was to be u&s;her at an academy, and I a&s;ked his advice on the affair. Our cou&s;in received the propo&s;al with a true Sardonic grin. Aye, cried he, this is a pretty career, indeed, that has been chalked out for you. I have been once an u&s;her at a boarding &s;chool my&s;elf; and may I die by an anodyne necklace, but I had rather be an under turnkey in Newgate. I was up early and late: I was brow-beat by the ma&s;ter, hated for my ugly face by the mi&s;|tre&s;s,
<PB N="4" REF="6">
worried by the boys within, and never permitted to &s;tir out to meet civility abroad. But are you &s;ure you are fit for a &s;chool? Let me examine you a little. Have you been bred apprentice to the bu&s;ine&s;s? No. Then you won't do for a &s;chool. Can you dre&s;s the boys hair? No. Then you won't do for a &s;chool. Have you had the &s;mall-pox? No. Then you won't do for a &s;chool. Can you lie three in a bed? No. Then you will never do for a &s;chool. Have you got a good &s;tomach? Yes. Then you will by no means do for a &s;chool. No, Sir, if you are for a genteel ea&s;y profe&s;&s;ion, bind your&s;elf &s;even years as an ap|prentice to turn a cutler's wheel; but avoid a &s;chool by any means. But come, continued he, I &s;ee you are a lad of &s;pi|rit and &s;ome learning, what do you think of commencing author, like me? You have read in books, no doubt, of men of genius &s;tarving at the trade: but at pre|&s;ent I'll &s;hew you forty very dull fellows
<PB N="5" REF="7">
about town that live by it in opulence. All hone&s;t jogg trotmen, who go on &s;moothly and dully, and write hi&s;tory and politics, and are prai&s;ed; and who, had they been bred coblers, would all their lives have only mended &s;hoes, but never made them.</P>
<P>"Finding that there was no great degree of gentility affixed to the character of an u&s;her, I re&s;olved to accept his propo&s;al; and having the highe&s;t re&s;pect for litera|ture, I hailed the antiqua mater of Grub-&s;treet with reverence. I thought it my glory to pur&s;ue a track which Dry|den and Otway trod before me. In fact, I con&s;idered the godde&s;s of this region as the parent of excellence; and how|ever an intercour&s;e with the world might give us good &s;en&s;e, the poverty &s;he grant|ed was the nur&s;e of genius! Big with the&s;e reflections, I &s;ate down, and find|ing that the be&s;t things remained to be &s;aid on the wrong &s;ide, I re&s;olved to write
<PB N="6" REF="8">
a book that &s;hould be wholly new. I therefore dre&s;t up three paradoxes with &s;ome ingenuity. They were fal&s;e, in|deed, but they were new. The jewels of truth have been &s;o often imported by others, that nothing was left for me to import but &s;ome &s;plendid things that at a di&s;tance looked every bit as well. Wit|ne&s;s you powers what fancied importance &s;ate perched upon my quill while I was writing. The whole learned world, I made no doubt, would ri&s;e to oppo&s;e my &s;y&s;tems; but then I was prepared to oppo&s;e the whole learned world. Like the porcupine I &s;ate &s;elf collected, with a quill pointed again&s;t every oppo&s;er."</P></Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well &s;aid, my boy,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and what &s;ubject did you treat upon? I hope you did not pa&s;s over the importance of Hierardical monogamy. But I inter|rupt, go on; you publi&s;hed your para|doxes; well, and what did the learned world &s;ay to your paradoxes?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="9">
<Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> replied my &s;on," <Q REND="inline margQuotes">the learned world &s;aid nothing to my paradoxes; nothing at all, Sir. Every man of them was employed in prai&s;ing his friends and him&s;elf, or condemning his enemies; and unfortunately, as I had neither, I &s;uffered the cruelle&s;t mortifi|cation," neglect. <P>"As I was meditating one day in a coffee-hou&s;e on the fate of my paradoxes, a little man happening to enter the room, placed him&s;elf in the box before me, and after &s;ome preliminary di&s;cour&s;e, finding me to be a &s;cholar, drew out a bundle of propo&s;als, begging me to &s;ub&s;cribe to a new edition he was going to give the world of Propertius, with notes. This demand nece&s;&s;arily produced a reply that that I had no money; and that conce&s;|&s;ion led him on to enquire into the na|ture of my expectations. Finding that my expectations were ju&s;t as great as my pur&s;e, I &s;ee, cried he, you are unac|quainted
<PB N="8" REF="10">
with the town, I'll teach you a part of it. Look at the&s;e propo&s;als, upon the&s;e very propo&s;als I have &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted very comfortably for twelve years. The moment a nobleman returns from his travels, a Creolian arrives from Jamaica, or a dowager from her country &s;eat, I &s;trike for a &s;ub&s;cription. I fir&s;t be&s;iege their hearts with flattery, and then pour in my propo&s;als at the breach. If they &s;ub&s;cribe readily the fir&s;t time, I renew my reque&s;t to beg a dedication fee. If they let me have that, I &s;mite them once more for engraving their coat of arms at the top. Thus, continued he, I live by vanity, and laugh at it. But between our&s;elves, I am now too well known, I &s;hould be glad to borrow your face a a bit: a nobleman of di&s;tinction has ju&s;t returned from Italy; my face is familiar to his porter; but if you bring this co|py of ver&s;es, my life for it you &s;ucceed, and we divide the &s;poil."</P></Q></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11">
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ble&s;s us, George,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and is that the employment of poets now! Do men of their exalted talents thus &s;toop to beggary! Can they &s;o far di&s;grace their calling, as to make a vile traffic of prai&s;e for bread?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O no, Sir,"</Q> returned he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a true po|et can never be &s;o ba&s;e; for wherever there is genius there is pride. The crea|tures I now de&s;cribe are only beggars in rhyme. The real poet, as he braves every hard&s;hip for fame, &s;o he is equally a coward to contempt, and none but tho&s;e who are unworthy protection con|de&s;cend to &s;olicit it.<P>"Having a mind too proud to &s;toop to &s;uch indignities, and yet a fortune too humble to hazard a &s;econd attempt for fame, I was now obliged to take a mid|dle cour&s;e, and write for bread. But I was unqualified for a profe&s;&s;ion where mere indu&s;try alone could en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s.
<PB N="10" REF="12">
I could not &s;uppre&s;s my lurking pa&s;&s;ion for applau&s;e; but u&s;ually con&s;umed that time in efforts after excellence which takes up but little room, when it &s;hould have been more advantageou&s;ly employ|ed in the diffu&s;ive productions of fruitful mediocrity. My little piece would come forth in the mi&s;t of periodical pub|lication, unnoticed and unknown. The public were more importantly employed, than to ob&s;erve the ea&s;y &s;implicity of my &s;tyle, or the harmony of my periods. Sheet after &s;heet was thrown off to ob|livion. My e&s;&s;ays were buried among the e&s;&s;ays upon liberty, ea&s;tern tales, and cures for the bite of a mad dog; while Philantos, Philalethes, Philelutheros, and Philanthropos, all wrote better, becau&s;e they wrote fa&s;ter, than I.</P>
<P>"Now, therefore, I began to a&s;&s;ociate with none but di&s;appointed authors, like my&s;elf, who prai&s;ed, deplored, and de|&s;pi&s;ed each other. The &s;atisfaction we
<PB N="11" REF="13">
found in every celebrated writer's at|tempts, was inver&s;ely as their merits. I found that no genius in another could plea&s;e me. My unfortunate paradoxes had entirely dried up that &s;ource of com|fort. I could neither read nor write with &s;atisfaction; for excellence in an|other was my aver&s;ion, and writing was my trade.</P>
<P>"In the mid&s;t of the&s;e gloomy reflec|tions, as I was one day &s;itting on a bench in St. James's park, a young gentleman of di&s;tinction, who had been my inti|mate acquaintance at the univer&s;ity, ap|proached me. We &s;aluted each other with &s;ome he&s;itation, he almo&s;t a&s;hamed of being known to one who made &s;o &s;habby an appearance, and I afraid of a repul&s;e. But my &s;u&s;picions &s;oon va|ni&s;hed; for Ned Thornhill was at the bottom a very good-natured fellow."</P></Q></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="14">
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What did you &s;ay, George?"</Q> inter|rupted I. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Thornhill, was not that his name? It can certainly be no other than my landlord."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ble&s;s me,"</Q> cried Mrs. Arnold, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is Mr. Thornhill &s;o near a neighbour of yours? He has long been a friend in our family, and we expect a vi&s;it from him &s;hortly."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My friend's fir&s;t care,"</Q> continued my &s;on, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"was to alter my appearance by a very fine &s;uit of his own cloaths, and then I was admitted to his table upon the footing of half-friend, half-under|ling. My bu&s;ine&s;s was to attend him at auctions, to put him in &s;pirits when he &s;ate for his picture, to take the left hand in his chariot when not filled by another, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t at tattering a kip, as the phra&s;e was, when we had a mind for a frolic. Be&s;ide this, I had twenty other little employments in the family. I was to do many &s;mall things without bidding; to carry the cork &s;crew; to &s;tand godfather
<PB N="13" REF="15">
to all the butler's children; to &s;ing when I was bid; to be never out of hu|mour; always to be humble, and, if I could, to be happy.<P>"In this honourable po&s;t, however, I was not without a rival. A captain of ma|rines, who &s;eemed formed for the place by nature, oppo&s;ed me in my patron's affections. His mother had been laundre&s;s to a man of quality, and thus he early acquired a ta&s;te for pimping and pedi|gree. As this gentleman made it the &s;tu|dy of his life to be acquainted with lords, though he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from &s;everal for his &s;tupidity; yet he found many of them who permitted his a&s;&s;iduities, being as dull as him&s;elf. As flattery was his trade, he practi&s;ed it with the ea&s;ie&s;t addre&s;s imaginable; but it came aukward and &s;tiff from me; and as every day my pa|tron's de&s;ire of flattery encrea&s;ed, &s;o eve|ry hour being better acquainted with his defects, I became more unwilling to give
<PB N="14" REF="16">
it. Thus I was once more fairly going to give up the field to the captain, when my friend found occa&s;ion for my a&s;&s;i&s;|tance. This was nothing le&s;s than to fight a duel for him, with a gentleman who&s;e &s;i&s;ter it was pretended he had u&s;ed ill. I readily complied with his reque&s;t, and tho' I &s;ee you are di&s;plea&s;ed at my conduct, yet as it was a debt indi&s;pen&s;ably due to friend&s;hip, I could not refu&s;e. I under|took the affair, di&s;armed my antagoni&s;t, and &s;oon after had the plea&s;ure of find|ing that the lady was only a woman of the town, and the fellow her bully and a &s;harper. This piece of &s;ervice was re|paid with the warme&s;t profe&s;&s;ions of gra|titude; but as my friend was to leave town in a few days, he knew no other method to &s;erve me, but by recommend|ing me to his uncle Sir William Thorn|hill, and another nobleman of great di&s;|tinction, who enjoyed a po&s;t under the government. When he was gone, my fir&s;t care was to carry his recommenda|tory
<PB N="15" REF="17">
letter to his uncle, a man who&s;e character for every virtue was univer&s;al, yet ju&s;t. I was received by his &s;ervants with the mo&s;t ho&s;pitable &s;miles; for the looks of the dome&s;tics ever tran&s;mit their ma&s;|ter's benevolence. Being &s;hewn into a grand apartment, where Sir William &s;oon came to me, I delivered my me&s;|&s;age and letter, which he read, and after pau&s;ing &s;ome minutes, Pray, Sir, cried he, inform me what you have done for my kin&s;man, to de&s;erve this warm re|commendation? But I &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, I gue&s;s at your merits, you have fought for him; and &s;o you would expect a reward from me, for being the in&s;trument of his vices. I wi&s;h, &s;incerely wi&s;h, that my pre&s;ent refu&s;al may be &s;ome puni&s;hment for your guilt; but &s;till more, that it may be &s;ome inducement to your repen|tance.&mdash;The &s;everity of this rebuke I bore patiently, becau&s;e I knew it was ju&s;t. My whole expectations now, there|fore, lay in my letter to the great man.
<PB N="16" REF="18">
As the doors of the nobility are almo&s;t ever be&s;et with beggars, all ready to thru&s;t in &s;ome &s;ly petition, I found it no ea&s;y matter to gain admittance. How|ever, after bribing the &s;ervants with half my worldly fortune, I was at la&s;t &s;hewn into a &s;pacious apartment, my letter be|ing previou&s;ly &s;ent up for his lord&s;hip's in&s;pection. During this anxious interval I had full time to look round me. Eve|ry thing was grand, and of happy con|trivance: the paintings, the furniture, the gildings, petrified me with awe, and rai&s;ed my idea of the owner. Ah, thought I to my&s;elf, how very great mu&s;t the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of all the&s;e things be, who carries in his head the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tate, and who&s;e hou&s;e di&s;plays half the wealth of a kingdom: &s;ure his genius mu&s;t be unfathomable! During the&s;e awful reflections I heard a &s;tep come heavily forward. Ah, this is the great man him|&s;elf! No, it was only a chambermaid. Another foot was heard &s;oon after. This
<PB N="17" REF="19">
mu&s;t be He! No, it was only the great man's valet de chambre. At la&s;t his lord&s;hip actually made his appearance. Are you, cried he, the bearer of this here letter? I an&s;wered with a bow. I learn by this, continued he, as how that&mdash;But ju&s;t at that in&s;tant a &s;ervant delivered him a card, and without taking farther no|tice, he went out of the room, and left me to dige&s;t my own happine&s;s at lei&s;ure. I &s;aw no more of him, till told by a footman that his lord&s;hip was going to his coach at the door. Down I immediately fol|lowed, and joined my voice to that of three or four more, who came, like me, to petition for favours. His lord&s;hip, however, went too fa&s;t for us, and was gaining his Chariot door with large &s;tri|des, when I hallowed out to know if I was to have any reply. He was by this time got in, and muttered an an&s;wer, half of which only I heard, the other half was lo&s;t in the rattling of his chariot wheels. I &s;tood for &s;ome time with my neck
<PB N="18" REF="20">
&s;tretched out, in the po&s;ture of one that was li&s;tening to catch the glorious &s;ounds, till looking round me, I found my&s;elf alone at his lord&s;hip's gate.</P></Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My patience,"</Q> continued my &s;on, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"was now quite exhau&s;ted: &s;tung with the thou&s;and indignities I had met with, I was willing to ca&s;t my&s;elf away, and on|ly wanted the gulph to receive me. I regarded my&s;elf as one of tho&s;e vile things that nature de&s;igned &s;hould be thrown by into her lumber room, there to peri&s;h in unpitied ob&s;curity. I had &s;till, however, half a guinea left, and of that I thought fortune her&s;elf &s;hould not deprive me: but in order to be &s;ure of this, I was re&s;olved to go in&s;tantly and &s;pend it while I had it, and then tru&s;t to occur|rences for the re&s;t. As I was going along with this re&s;olution, it happened that Mr. Crip&s;e's office &s;eemed invitingly open to give me a welcome reception. In this office Mr. Crip&s;e kindly offers all his
<PB N="19" REF="21">
maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects a generous promi&s;e of 30 l. a year, for which promi&s;e all they give in return is their liberty for life, and permi&s;&s;ion to let him tran&s;port them to America as &s;laves. I was happy at find|ing a place where I could lo&s;e my fears in de&s;peration, and therefore entered this cell; for it had the appearance of one, being dark, damp, and dirty. Here I found a number of poor creatures, all in circum&s;tances like my&s;elf, expecting the arrival of Mr. Crip&s;e, pre&s;enting a true epitome of Engli&s;h impatience. Each untractable &s;oul at variance with fortune, wreaked her injuries on their own hearts: but Mr. Crip&s;e at la&s;t came down, and all our murmurs were hu&s;h|ed. He deigned to regard me with an air of peculiar approbation, and indeed he was the fir&s;t man who for a month pa&s;t talk|ed to me with &s;miles. After a few que&s;|tions, he found I was fit for every thing in the world. He pau&s;ed a while upon the propere&s;t means of providing for me,
<PB N="20" REF="22">
and &s;lapping his forehead, as if he had found it, a&s;&s;ured me, that there was at that time an emba&s;&s;y talked of from the &s;ynod of Pen&s;ylvania to the Chicka&s;aw Indians, and that he would u&s;e his inte|re&s;t to get me made &s;ecretary. I knew in my own heart that the fellow lied, and yet his promi&s;e gave me plea&s;ure, there was &s;omething &s;o magni&s;icent in the &s;ound. I fairly, therefore, divided my half guinea, one half of which went to be added to his thirty thou&s;and pound, and with the other half I re&s;olved to go to the next tavern, to be there more happy than he.<P>"As I was going out with that re&s;olution, I was met at the door by the captain of a &s;hip, with whom I had formerly &s;ome little acquaintance, and he agreed to be my companion over a bowl of punch. As I never cho&s;e to make a &s;ecret of my circum&s;tances, he a&s;&s;ured me that I was upon the very point of ruin, in li&s;tening
<PB N="21" REF="23">
to the office-keeper's promi&s;es; for that he only de&s;igned to &s;ell me to the plan|tations. But, continued he, I fancy you might, by a much &s;horter voyage, be ve|ry ea&s;ily put into a genteel way of bread. Take my advice. My &s;hip &s;ails to-mor|row for Am&s;terdam; What if you go in her as a pa&s;&s;enger? The moment you land all you have to do is to teach the Dutchmen Engli&s;h, and I'll warrant you'll get pupils and money enough. I &s;uppo&s;e you under&s;tand Engli&s;h, added he, by this time, or the deuce is in it. I confidently a&s;&s;ured him of that; but ex|pre&s;&s;ed a doubt whether the Dutch would be willing to learn Engli&s;h. He affirmed with an oath that they were fond of it to di&s;traction; and upon that affirmation I agreed with his propo&s;al, and embarked the next day to teach the Dutch Engli&s;h in Holland. The wind was fair, our voyage &s;hort, and after having paid my pa&s;&s;age with half my moveables, I found my&s;elf, fallen as if from the &s;kies, a
<PB N="22" REF="24">
&s;tranger in one of the principal &s;treets of Am&s;terdam. In this &s;ituation I was un|willing to let any time pa&s;s unemployed in teaching. I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf there|fore to two or three of tho&s;e I met, who&s;e appearance &s;eemed mo&s;t promi&s;ing; but it was impo&s;&s;ible to make our&s;elves mu|tually under&s;tood. It was not till this very moment I recollected, that in order to teach Dutchmen Engli&s;h, it was nece&s;|&s;ary that they &s;hould fir&s;t teach me Dutch. How I came to overlook &s;o obvious an objection, is to me amazing; but certain it is I overlooked it.</P>
<P>"This &s;cheme thus blown up, I had &s;ome thoughts of fairly &s;hipping back to England again; but happening into company with an Iri&s;h &s;tudent, who was returning from Louvain, our conver&s;ation turning upon topics of literature, (for by the way it may be ob&s;erved, that I always forgot the meanne&s;s of my cir|cum&s;tances when I could conver&s;e upon
<PB N="23" REF="25">
&s;uch &s;ubjects) from him I learned that there were not two men in his whole uni|ver&s;ity who under&s;tood Greek. This amazed me. I in&s;tangly re&s;olved to tra|vel to Louvain, and there live by teach|ing Greek; and in this de&s;ign I was hear|tened by my brother &s;tudent, who threw out &s;ome hints that a fortune might be got by it.</P>
<P>"I &s;et boldly forward the next morning. Every day le&s;&s;ened the burthen of my moveables, like Ae&s;op and his ba&s;ket of bread; for I paid them for my lodgings to the Dutch as I travelled on. When I came to Louvain, I was re&s;olved not to go &s;neaking to the lower profe&s;&s;ors, but o|penly tendered my talents to the prin|cipal him&s;elf. I went, had admittance, and offered him my &s;ervice as a ma&s;ter of the Greek language, which I had been told was a de&s;ideratum in his univer&s;ity. The <HI>principal</HI> &s;eemed at fir&s;t to doubt of my abilities; but of the&s;e I offered to
<PB N="24" REF="26">
convince him, by turning a part of any Greek author he &s;hould fix upon into La|tin. Finding me perfectly earne&s;t in my propo&s;al, he addre&s;&s;ed me thus: You &s;ee me, young man, continued he, I never learned Greek, and I don't find that I ever mi&s;&s;ed it. I have had a doctor's cap and gown without Greek: I have ten thou&s;and florins a year without Greek; and I eat heartily without Greek. In &s;hort, continued he, I don't know Greek, and I do not believe there is any u&s;e in it.</P>
<P>"I was now too far from home to think of returning; &s;o I re&s;olved to go for|ward. I had &s;ome knowledge of mu&s;ic, with a tolerable voice, and now turned what was once my amu&s;ement into a pre|&s;ent means of bare &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. I pa&s;&s;ed among the harmle&s;s pea&s;ants of Flanders, and among &s;uch of the French as were poor enough to be very merry; for I
<PB N="25" REF="27">
ever found them &s;prightly in proportion to their wants. Whenever I approached a pea&s;ant's hou&s;e towards night-fall, I played one of my mo&s;t merry tunes, and that procured me not only a lodging, but &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for the next day. I once or twice attempted to play for people of fa&s;hion; but they &s;till thought my per|formance odious, and never rewarded me even with a trifle. This was to me the more extraordinary, as whenever I u&s;ed formerly to play for company, when playing was my amu&s;ement, my mu&s;ic never failed to throw them into raptures, and the ladies e&s;pecially; but as it was now my only means, it was received with contempt: a proof how ready the world is to under rate tho&s;e talents which a man lives by.</P>
<P>"In this manner I proceeded to Paris, with no de&s;ign but ju&s;t to look about me, and then to go forward. The people of
<PB N="26" REF="28">
Paris are much fonder of &s;trangers that have money, than of tho&s;e that have wit. You may imagine then, as I could not boa&s;t much of either, that I was no great favourite. After I had walked about the town four or five days, and &s;een the out&s;ides of the be&s;t hou&s;es, I was preparing to leave this retreat of ve|nal ho&s;pitality, when pa&s;&s;ing through one of the principal &s;treets, whom &s;hould I meet but our cou&s;in, to whom you fir&s;t recommended me. This meeting was very agreeable to me, and I believe not di&s;plea&s;ing to him. He enquired into the nature of my journey to Paris, and informed me of his bu&s;ine&s;s there, which was to collect pictures, medals, in|taglios, and antiques of all kinds, for a gentleman in London, who had ju&s;t &s;tept into ta&s;te and a large fortune. I was &s;till more &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;eeing our cou&s;in pitch|ed upon for this office, as him&s;elf had often a&s;&s;ured me he knew nothing of the
<PB N="27" REF="29">
matter. Upon my a&s;king how he had been taught the art of a conno&s;cento &s;o very &s;uddenly, he a&s;&s;ured me that no|thing was more ea&s;y. The whole &s;ecret con&s;i&s;ted in a &s;trict adherence to two rules: the one always to ob&s;erve, that the pic|ture might have been better if the pain|ter had taken more pains; and the other, to prai&s;e the works of Pietro Perugino. But, &s;ays he, as I once taught you how to be an author in London, I'll now undertake to in&s;truct you in the art of picture buying at Paris.</P>
<P>"With this propo&s;al I very readily clo&s;ed, as it was a living, and now all my ambition was to live. I went there|fore to his lodgings, improved my dre&s;s by his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and after &s;ome time, accompanied him to auctions of pictures, where the Engli&s;h gentry were expected to be purcha&s;ers. I was not a little &s;ur|pri&s;ed at his intimacy with people of the
<PB N="28" REF="30">
be&s;t fa&s;hion, who referred them&s;elves to his judgment upon every picture or me|dal, as to an unerring &s;tandard of ta&s;te. He made very good u&s;e of my a&s;&s;i&s;tance upon the&s;e occa&s;ions; for when a&s;ked his opinion, he would gravely take me a|&s;ide, and a&s;k mine, &s;hrug, look wi&s;e, re|turn, and a&s;&s;ure the company, that he could give no opinion upon an affair of &s;o much importance. Yet there was &s;ometimes an occa&s;ion for a more &s;up|ported a&s;&s;urance. I remember to have &s;een him, after giving his opinion that the colouring of a picture was not mel|low enough, very deliberately take a bru&s;h with brown varni&s;h, that was acci|dentally lying in the place, and rub it over the piece with great compo&s;ure be|fore all the company, and then a&s;k if he had not improved the tints.</P>
<P>"When he had fini&s;hed his commi&s;&s;ion in Paris, he left me &s;trongly recommend|ed
<PB N="29" REF="31">
to &s;everal men of di&s;tinction, as a per&s;on very proper for a travelling tutor; and I was after &s;ome time employed in that capa|city by a gentleman who brought his ward to Paris, in order to &s;et him forward on his tour through Europe. I was to be the young gentleman's governor, with this injunction, that he &s;hould always be permitted to direct him&s;elf. My pupil in fact under&s;tood the art of guiding in money concerns much better than me. He was heir to a fortune of about two hundred thou&s;and pounds, left him by an uncle in the We&s;t Indies; and his guardians, to qualify him for the ma|nagement of it, had bound him appren|tice to an attorney. Thus avarice was his prevailing pa&s;&s;ion: all his que&s;tions on the road were how money might be &s;aved, which was the lea&s;t expen&s;ive cour&s;e of travel; whether any thing could be bought that would turn to account when di&s;po&s;ed of again in London.
<PB N="30" REF="32">
Such curio&s;ities on the way as could be &s;een for nothing he was ready enough to look at; but if the &s;ight was to be paid for, he u&s;ually a&s;&s;erted that he had been told it was not worth &s;eeing. He never paid a bill, that he would not ob&s;erve, how amazingly expen&s;ive travelling was, and all this though he was not yet come to the age of twenty-one. When arrived at Leghorn, as we took a walk to look at the port and &s;hipping, he enquired the expence of the pa&s;&s;age by &s;ea home to England. This he was informed was but a trifle, compared to his returning by land, he was therefore unable to with&s;tand the temptation; &s;o paying me the &s;mall part of my &s;alary that was then due, he took leave, and embark|ed with only one attendant for Lon|don.</P>
<P>"I now therefore was left once more up|on the world at large; but then it was
<PB N="31" REF="33">
a thing I was u&s;ed to. However my &s;kill in mu&s;ic could avail me nothing in a country where every pea&s;ant was a bet|ter mu&s;ician than I; but by this time I had acquired another talent, which an|&s;wered my purpo&s;e as well, and this was a &s;kill in di&s;putation. In all the fo|reign univer&s;ities and convents, there are upon certain days philo&s;ophical the&s;es maintained again&s;t every adventitious di&s;|putant; for which, if the champion op|po&s;es with any dexterity, he can claim a gratuity in money, a dinner, and a bed for one night. In this manner therefore I fought my way towards England, walk|ed along from city to city, examined mankind more nearly, and, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, &s;aw both &s;ides of the picture. My remarks, however, were few: I found that monarchy was the be&s;t government for the poor to live in, and common|wealths for the rich. I found that riches in general were in every country another
<PB N="32" REF="34">
name for freedom; and that no man is &s;o &s;ond of freedom him&s;elf that he would not chu&s;e to &s;ubject the will of &s;ome in|dividuals of &s;ociety to his own.</P>
<P>"Upon my arrival in England, I re&s;olv|ed to pay my re&s;pects fir&s;t to you, and then to enli&s;t as a volunteer in the fir&s;t expedition that was &s;ent out; but on my journey down my re&s;olutions were changed, by meeting an old acquaintace, who I found belonged to a company of comedians, that were going to make a &s;ummer campaign in the country. The company &s;eemed not much to di&s;approve of me for an a&s;&s;ociate. They all, how|ever, apprized me of the importance of the ta&s;k at which I aimed; that the pub|lic was a many headed mon&s;ter, and that only &s;uch as had very good heads could plea&s;e it: that acting was not to be learnt in a day; and that without &s;ome traditi|onal &s;hrugs, which had been on the
<PB N="33" REF="35">
&s;tage, and only on the &s;tage, the&s;e hun|dred years, I could never pretend to plea&s;e. The next difficulty was in fit|ting me with parts, as almo&s;t every cha|racter was in keeping. I was driven for &s;ome time from one character to another, till at la&s;t Horatio was fixed upon, which the pre&s;ence of the pre&s;ent company happily hindered me from acting."</P></Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The &s;hort continuance of friend&s;hip a|mong&s;t the vicious, which is coeval only with mutual &s;atisfaction.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MY &s;on's account was too long to be delivered at once, the fir&s;t part of it was begun that night, and he was conclu|ding the re&s;t after dinner the next day, when the appearance of Mr. Thornhill's equi|page at the door &s;eemed to make a pau&s;e in the general &s;atisfaction. The but|ler, who was now become my friend in the family, informed me with a whi&s;per, that the 'Squire had already made &s;ome over|tures to Mi&s;s Wilmot, and that her aunt and uncle &s;eemed highly to approve the
<PB N="36" REF="37">
match. Upon Mr. Thornhill's entering, he &s;eemed, at &s;eeing my &s;on and me, to &s;tart back; but I readily imputed that to &s;urprize, and not di&s;plea&s;ure. However, upon our advancing to &s;alute him, he re|turned our greeting with the mo&s;t appa|rent candour; and after a &s;hort time, his pre&s;ence &s;eemed only to encrea&s;e the gene|ral good humour.</P>
<P>After tea he called me a&s;ide, to enquire after my daughter; but upon my informing him that my enquiry was un&s;ucce&s;sful, he &s;eemed greatly &s;urpri&s;ed; adding, that he had been &s;ince frequently at my hou&s;e, in order to comfort the re&s;t of my family, whom he left perfectly well. He then a&s;ked if I had communicated her misfor|tune to Mi&s;s Wilmot, or my &s;on; and up|on my replying that I had not told them as yet, he greatly approved my prudence and precaution, de&s;iring me by all means to keep it a &s;ecret: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"For at be&s;t,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it is but divulging one's own infamy;
<PB N="37" REF="38">
and perhaps Mi&s;s Livy may not be &s;o guilty as we all imagine."</Q> We were here interrupted by a &s;ervant, who came to a&s;k the 'Squire in, to &s;tand up at country dances; &s;o that he left me quite plea&s;ed with the in|tere&s;t he &s;eemed to take in my concerns. His addre&s;&s;es, however, to Mi&s;s Wilmot, were too obvious to be mi&s;taken; and yet &s;he &s;eemed not perfectly plea&s;ed, but bore them rather in compliance to the will of her aunt, than from real inclination. I had even the &s;atis|faction to &s;ee her lavi&s;h &s;ome kind looks upon my unfortunate &s;on, which the other could neither extort by his fortune nor a&s;|&s;iduity. Mr. Thornhill's &s;eeming compo&s;ure, however, not a little &s;urpri&s;ed me: we had now continued here a week, at the pre&s;&s;ing in&s;tances of Mr. Arnold; but each day the more tenderne&s;s Mi&s;s Wilmot &s;hewed my &s;on, Mr. Thornhill's friend&s;hip &s;eemed pro|portionably to encrea&s;e for him.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="39">
He had formerly made us the mo&s;t kind a&s;&s;urances of u&s;ing his intere&s;t to &s;erve the family; but now his genero&s;ity was not con|fined to promi&s;es alone: the morning I de|&s;igned for my departure, Mr. Thornhill came to me with looks of real plea&s;ure to inform me of a piece of &s;ervice he had done for his friend George. This was nothing le&s;s than his having procured him an en&s;ign's commi&s;&s;ion in one of the regiments that was going to the We&s;t Indies, for which he had promi&s;ed but one hundred pounds, his intere&s;t having been &s;ufficient to get an abatement of the other two. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As for this trifling piece of &s;ervice,"</Q> continued the young gentleman, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I de&s;ire no other reward but the plea&s;ure of having &s;erved my friend; and as for the hundred pound to be paid, if you are unable to rai&s;e it your&s;elves, I will advance it, and you &s;hall repay me at your lei&s;ure."</Q> This was a favour we wanted words to ex|pre&s;s our &s;en&s;e of: I readily therefore gave my bond for the money, and te&s;tified
<PB N="39" REF="40">
as much gratitude as if I never intended to pay.</P>
<P>George was to depart for town the next day to &s;ecure his commi&s;&s;ion, in pur&s;uance of his generous patron's directions, who judged it highly expedient to u&s;e di&s;patch, le&s;t in the mean time another &s;hould &s;tep in with more advantageous propo&s;als. The next morning, therefore, our young &s;oldier was early prepared for his departure, and &s;eemed the only per&s;on among us that was not affected by it. Neither the fatigues and dangers he was going to encounter, nor the friends and mi&s;tre&s;s, for Mi&s;s Wilmot actually loved him, he was leaving behind, any way damped his &s;pirits. After he had taken leave of the re&s;t of the company, I gave him all I had, my ble&s;&s;ing. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And now, my boy,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"thou art going to fight for thy country, remember how thy brave grandfather fought for his &s;a|cred king, when loyalty among Britons was a virtue. Go, my boy, and immitate

him in all but his misfortunes, if it was a misfortune to die with Lord Falk|land. Go, my boy, and if you fall, tho' di&s;tant, expo&s;ed and unwept by tho&s;e that love you, the mo&s;t precious tears are tho&s;e with which heaven bedews the un|buried head of a &s;oldier."</Q></P>
<P>The next morning I took leave of the good family, that had been kind enough to entertain me &s;o long, not without &s;everal expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude to Mr. Thornhill for his late bounty. I left them in the en|joyment of all that happine&s;s which afflu|ence and good breeding procure, and re|turned towards home, de&s;pairing of ever finding my daughter more, but &s;ending a &s;igh to heaven to &s;pare and to forgive her. I was now come within about twenty miles of home, having hired an hor&s;e to carry me, as I was yet but weak, and comforted my&s;elf with the hopes of &s;oon &s;eeing all I held deare&s;t upon earth. But the night
<PB N="41" REF="42">
coming on, I put up at a little public-hou&s;e by the road-&s;ide, and a&s;ked for the land|lord's company over a pint of wine. We &s;ate be&s;ide his kitchen fire, which was the be&s;t room in the hou&s;e, and chatted on po|litics and the news of the country. We happened, among other topics, to talk of young 'Squire Thornhill, whom the ho&s;t a&s;|&s;ured me was hated as much as an uncle of his, who &s;ometimes came down to the country, was loved. He went on to ob&s;erve, that he made it his whole &s;tudy to betray the daugh|ters of &s;uch as received him to their hou&s;es, and after a fortnight or three weeks po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he turned them out unrewarded and aban|doned to the world. As we continued our di&s;cour&s;e in this manner, his wife, who had been out to get change, returned, and per|ceiving that her hu&s;band was enjoying a plea&s;ure in which &s;he was not a &s;harer, &s;he a&s;ked him, in an angry tone, what he did there, to which he only replied in an ironi|cal way, by drinking her health. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mr.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Offences are ea&s;ily pardoned where there is love at bottom.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE next morning I took my daugh|ter behind me, and &s;et out on my return home. As we travelled along, I &s;trove, by every per&s;ua&s;ion, to calm her &s;orrows and fears, and to arm her with re&s;o|lution to bear the pre&s;ence of her offended mother. I took every opportunity, from the pro&s;pect of a fine country, through which we pa&s;&s;ed, to ob&s;erve how much kin|der heaven was to us, than we were to each other, and that the misfortunes of nature's making were very few. I a&s;&s;ured her, that &s;he &s;hould never perceive any change in
<PB N="56" REF="56">
my affections, and that during my life, which yet might be long, &s;he might depend upon a guardian and an in&s;tructor. I armed her again&s;t the cen&s;ures of the world, &s;hew|ed her that books were &s;weet unreproach|ing companions to the mi&s;erable, and that if they could not bring us to enjoy life, they would teach us to endure it.</P>
<P>The hired hor&s;e that we rode was to be put up that night at an inn by the way, within about five miles from my hou&s;e, and as I was willing to prepare my family for my daughter's reception, I determined to leave her that night at the inn, and to come for her, accompanied by my daughter So|phia, early the next morning. It was night before we reached our appointed &s;tage: however, after &s;eeing her provided with a decent apartment, and having ordered the ho&s;te&s;s to prepare proper refre&s;hments, I ki&s;&s;ed her, and proceeded towards home. My heart caught new &s;en&s;ations of plea&s;ure
<PB N="57" REF="57">
the nearer I approached that peaceful man&s;ion. As a bird that has been fright|ed from its ne&s;t, my affections out-went my ha&s;te, and hovered round my little fire-&s;ide, with all the rapture of expectation. I called up the many fond things I had to &s;ay, and anticipated the welcome I was to receive. I already felt my wife's tender em|brace, and &s;miled at the joy of my little ones. As I walked but &s;lowly, the night wained apace. The labourers of the day were all retired to re&s;t; the lights were out in every cottage; no &s;ounds were heard but of the &s;hrilling cock, and the deep-mouthed watch-dog, at hollow di&s;tance. I approach|ed my little abode of plea&s;ure, and before I was within a furlong of the place, our hone&s;t ma&s;tiff came running to welcome me.</P>
<P>It was now near mid-night that I came to knock at my door: all was &s;till and &s;i|lent: my heart dilated with unutterable hap|pine&s;s,
<PB N="58" REF="58">
when, to my amazement, the hou&s;e was bur&s;ting out in a blaze of fire, and every apperture was red with conflagration! I gave a loud convul&s;ive outcry, and fell upon the pavement in&s;en&s;ible. This alarm|ed my &s;on, who perceiving the flames, in|&s;tantly waked my wife and daughter, and all running out, naked, and wild with ap|prehen&s;ion, recalled me to life with their angui&s;h. But it was only to objects of new terror; for the flames had, by this time, caught the roof of our dwelling, part after part continuing to fall in, while the family &s;tood, with &s;ilent agony, looking on, as if they enjoyed the blaze. I gazed upon them and upon it by turns, and then looked round me for my two little ones; but they were not to be &s;een. O mi&s;ery! <Q REND="inline">"Where,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"where are my little ones?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"They are burnt to death in the flames,"</Q> &s;ays my wife calmly, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and I will die with them."</Q>&mdash;That moment I heard the cry of the babes within, who were ju&s;t awak|ed
<PB N="59" REF="59">
by the fire, and nothing could have &s;topped me. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Where, where, are my children?"</Q> cried I, ru&s;hing through the flames, and bur&s;ting the door of the cham|ber in which they were confined, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Where are my little ones?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Here, dear papa, here we are,"</Q> cried they together, while the flames were ju&s;t catching the bed where they lay. I caught them both in my arms, and &s;natched them through the fire as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, while ju&s;t as I was got out, the roof &s;unk in. <Q REND="inline">"Now,"</Q> cried I, holding up my children, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"now let the flames burn on, and all my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions peri&s;h. Here they are, I have &s;aved my trea&s;ure.

<P><PB N="60" REF="60">
I now &s;tood a calm &s;pectator of the flames, and after &s;ome time, began to per|ceive that my arm to the &s;houlder was &s;corched in a terrible manner. It was there|fore out of my power to give my &s;on any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, either in attempting to fave our goods, or preventing the flames &s;preading to our corn. By this time, the neighbours were alarmed, and came running to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but all they could do was to &s;tand, like us, &s;pectators of the calamity. My goods, among which were the notes I had re&s;erved for my daughters fortunes, were entirely con&s;umed, except a box, with &s;ome papers, that &s;tood in the kitchen, and two or three things more of little con&s;equence, which my &s;on brought away in the begin|ning. The neighbours contributed, how|ever, what they could to lighten our di&s;tre&s;s. They brought us cloaths, and furni&s;hed one of our out-hou&s;es with kitchen uten&s;ils; &s;o that by day-light we had another, tho' a wretched, dwelling to retire to. My hone&s;t next

<P>When the fears of my family had &s;ub|&s;ided, curio&s;ity to know the cau&s;e of my long &s;tay began to take place; having therefore informed them of every particular, I proceeded to prepare them for the recep|tion of our lo&s;t one, and tho' we had no|thing but wretchedne&s;s now to impart, yet to procure her a welcome to what we had. This ta&s;k would have been more difficult but for our recent calamity, which had humbled my wife's pride, and blunted it by more poignant afflictions. Being una|able to go for my poor child my&s;elf, as my arm now grew very painful, I &s;ent my &s;on and daughter, who &s;oon returned, &s;upport|ing the wretched delinquent, who had not courage to look up at her mother, whom

<P>SOME a&s;&s;iduity was now required to make our pre&s;ent abode as convenient as po&s;&s;ible, and we were &s;oon again qualified to enjoy our former &s;erenity.

was not la&s;t among the&s;e vi&s;itors; but heartily offered his friend&s;hip. He would even have renewed his addre&s;&s;es to my daughter; but &s;he rejected them in &s;uch a manner as totally repre&s;t his future &s;oli|citations. Her grief &s;eemed formed for continuing, and &s;he was the only per&s;on of our little &s;ociety that a week did not re&s;tore to chearfulne&s;s. She now lo&s;t that un|blu&s;hing innocence which once taught her to re&s;pect her&s;elf, and to &s;eek plea&s;ure by plea&s;ing. Anxeity now had taken &s;trong po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of her mind, her beauty began to be impaired with her con&s;titution, and neglect &s;till more contributed to dimini&s;h it.

As &s;he &s;tood one day care&s;&s;ing her infant &s;on in the open window of an apartment, which hung over the river Volturna, the child, with a &s;udden &s;pring, leaped from her arms into the flood below, and di&s;appeared in a moment. The mother, &s;truck with in|&s;tant &s;urprize, and making an effort to &s;ave him, plunged in after; but, far
<PB N="68" REF="67">
from being able to a&s;&s;i&s;t the infant, &s;he her&s;elf with great difficulty e&s;caped to the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, ju&s;t when &s;ome French &s;oldiers were plundering the coun|try on that &s;ide, who immediately made her their pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>"As the war was then carried on between the French and Italians with the utmo&s;t in|humanity, they were going at once to per|petrate tho&s;e two extremes, &s;ugge&s;ted by appetite and cruelty. This ba&s;e re&s;olution, however, was oppo&s;ed by a young offi|cer, who, tho' their retreat required the utmo&s;t expedition, placed her behind him, and brought her in &s;afety to his native city. Her beauty at fir&s;t caught his eye, her merit &s;oon after his heart. They were married; he ro&s;e to the highe&s;t po&s;ts; they lived long toge|ther, and were happy. But the felicity of a &s;oldier can never be called perma|nent: after an interval of &s;everal years,

the troops which he commanded having met with a repul&s;e, he was obliged to take &s;helter in the city where he had lived with his wife. Here they &s;uffered a &s;iege, and the city at length was taken. Few hi&s;tories can produce more various in|&s;tances of cruelty, than tho&s;e which the French and Italians at that time exer|ci&s;ed upon each other. It was re&s;olved by the victors, upon this occa&s;ion, to put all the French pri&s;oners to death; but particularly the hu&s;band of the un|fortunate Matilda, as he was principally in&s;trumental in protracting the &s;iege. Their determinations were, in general, executed almo&s;t as &s;oon as re&s;olved up|on. The captive &s;oldier was led forth, and the executioner, with his &s;word, &s;tood ready, while the &s;pectators in gloo|my &s;ilence awaited the fatal blow, which was only &s;u&s;pended till the general, who pre&s;ided as judge, &s;hould give the &s;ignal.

The general, who was a young man, was &s;truck with &s;urprize at her beauty, and pity at her di&s;tre&s;s; but with &s;till &s;tronger emotions when he heard her mention her former dangers. He was her &s;on, the infant for whom &s;he had encounter'd &s;o much danger. He ac|knowledged her at once as his mother, and fell at her feet. The re&s;t may be ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;ed: the captive was &s;et free, and all the happine&s;s that love, friend|&s;hip, and duty could confer on each, were united."</P></Q></P>
<P>In this manner I would attempt to amu&s;e my daughter; but &s;he li&s;tened with divided attention; for her own misfortunes engro&s;&s;ed

the pity &s;he once had for tho&s;e of another, and nothing gave her ea&s;e. In company &s;he dreaded contempt; and in &s;olitude &s;he only found anxiety.

All the friends of both families, he &s;aid, were there, particularly the 'Squire's uncle, Sir William Thornhill, who bore &s;o good a character. He added, that nothing but mirth and fea&s;ting were going forward; that all the country prai&s;ed the young bride's beauty, and the bridegroom's fine per&s;on, and that they were immen&s;ely fond of each other; concluding, that he

<P>My wife and &s;on, who were pre&s;ent at this interview, &s;eemed terrified with the ap|prehen&s;ion.

the utmo&s;t &s;tretch of his malevolence: he had already &s;truck the blow, and now I &s;tood prepared to repel every new ef|fort. Like one of tho&s;e in&s;truments u&s;ed in the art of war, which, however thrown, &s;till pre&s;ents a point to receive the enemy.</P>
<P>We &s;oon, however, found that he had not threatened in vain; for the very next day his &s;teward came to demand my annual rent, which, by the train of accidents al|ready related, I was unable to pay.

My wife and children now therefore entreated me to comply upon any terms, rather than incur certain de&s;truction.

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why, my trea&s;ures,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"why will you thus attempt to per&s;uade me to the thing that is not right!

<P>In this manner we &s;pent that evening. Early the next morning, as the &s;now had fallen in great abundance in the night, my &s;on was employed in clearing it away, and opening a pa&s;&s;age before the door.

<P>Ju&s;t as he &s;poke they came in, and ap|proaching the bed where I lay, after previ|ou&s;ly informing me of their employment and bu&s;ine&s;s, made me their pri&s;oner, bid|ding me prepare to go with them to the county gaol, which was eleven miles off.</P>

<P>WE &s;et forward from this peaceful neighbourhood, and walked on &s;lowly. My elde&s;t daughter being enfee|bled by a &s;low fever, which had begun for &s;ome days to undermine her con&s;titu|tion, one of the officers, who had an hor&s;e, kindly took her behind him; for even the&s;e men cannot entirely dive&s;t them|&s;elves of humanity.

<P><PB N="90" REF="88">
We were now got from my late dwel|ling about two miles, when we &s;aw a crowd running and &s;houting behind us, con&s;i&s;ting of about fifty of my poore&s;t pa|ri&s;hioners.

The con&s;equence might have been fatal, had I not immediately interpo&s;ed, and with &s;ome difficulty re&s;cued the officers from the hands of the enraged multitude. My chil|dren, who looked upon my delivery now as certain, appeared tran&s;ported with joy, and were incapable of containing their rap|tures. But they were &s;oon undeceived, up|on hearing me addre&s;s the poor deluded people, who came, as they imagined, to do me &s;ervice.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="89">
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What! my friends,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and is this the way you love me!

But let it at lea&s;t be my comfort when I pen my fold for immortality, that not one here &s;hall be wanting."</Q></P>
<P>They now &s;eemed all repentance, and melting into tears, came one after the other to bid me farewell. I &s;hook each tenderly by the hand, and leaving them my ble&s;&s;ing, proceeded forward without meeting any

farther interruption. Some hours before night we reached the town, or rather vil|lage; for it con&s;i&s;ted but of a few mean hou&s;es, having lo&s;t all its former opulence, and retaining no marks of its ancient &s;upe|riority but the gaol.</P>
<P>Upon entering, we put up at an inn, where we had &s;uch refre&s;hments as could mo&s;t readily be procured, and I &s;upped with my family with my u&s;ual chearfulne&s;s. Af|ter &s;eeing them properly accommodated for that night, I next attended the &s;heriff's of|ficers to the pri&s;on, which had formerly been built for the purpo&s;es of war, and con&s;i&s;ted of one large apartment, &s;trongly grated, and paved with &s;tone, common to both felons and debtors at certain hours in the four and twenty. Be&s;ides this, every pri&s;oner had a &s;eparate cell, where he was locked in for the night.</P>
<P>I expected upon my entrance to find no|thing but lamentations, and various &s;ounds
<PB N="93" REF="91">
of mi&s;ery; but it was very different. The pri|&s;oners &s;eemed all employed in one common de&s;ign, that of forgetting thought in merri|ment or clamour. I was apprized of the u&s;ual perqui&s;ite required upon the&s;e occa|&s;ions, and immediately complied with the demand, though the little money I had was very near being all exhau&s;ted. This was immediately &s;ent away for liquor, and the whole pri&s;on &s;oon was filled with riot, laughter, and prophanene&s;s.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How,"</Q> cried I to my&s;elf, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;hall men &s;o very wicked be chearful, and &s;hall I be melancholy! I feel only the &s;ame confinement with them, and I think I have more rea&s;on to be happy."</Q></P>
<P>With &s;uch reflections I laboured to be|come chearful; but chearfulne&s;s was never yet produced by effort, which is it&s;elf pain|ful. As I was &s;itting therefore in a corner of the gaol, in a pen&s;ive po&s;ture, one of
<PB N="94" REF="92">
my fellow pri&s;oners came up, and &s;itting by me, entered into conver&s;ation. It was my con&s;tant rule in life never to avoid the conver&s;ation of any man who &s;eemed to de|&s;ire it: for if good, I might profit by his in&s;truction; if bad, he might be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by mine. I found this to be a knowing man, of &s;trong unlettered &s;en&s;e; but a thorough knowledge of the world, as it is called, or, more properly &s;peaking, of human nature on the wrong &s;ide. He a&s;ked me if I had taken care to provide myfelf with a bed, which was a circum&s;tance I had never once at|tended to.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That's unfortunate,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"as you are allowed here nothing but &s;traw, and your apartment is very large and cold.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE next morning early I was awakened by my family, whom I found in tears at my bed-&s;ide. The gloomy &s;trength of every thing about us, it &s;eems, had daunted them. I gently rebuked their &s;orrow, a&s;|&s;uring them I had never &s;lept with greater tranquility, and next enquired after my elde&s;t daughter, who was not among them. They informed me that ye&s;terday's unea&s;i|ne&s;s and fatigue had encrea&s;ed her fever, and it was judged proper to leave her be|hind. My next care was to &s;end my &s;on to procure a room or two to lodge the
<PB N="102" REF="99">
family in, as near the pri&s;on as conveniently could be found. He obeyed; but could only find one apartment, which was hired at a &s;mall expence, for his mother and &s;i&s;ters, the gaoler with humanity con&s;enting to let him and his two little brothers lie in the pri&s;on with me. A bed was therefore pre|pared for them in a corner of the room, which I thought an&s;wered very convenient|ly. I was willing however previou&s;ly to know whether my little children cho&s;e to lie in a place which &s;eemed to fright them upon entrance.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"my good boys, how do you like your bed? I hope you are not afraid to lie in this room, dark as it appears."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No, papa,"</Q> &s;ays Dick, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am not afraid to lie any where where you are."</Q></P>

<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And I,"</Q> &s;ays Bill, who was yet but four years old, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"love every place be&s;t that my papa is in."</Q></P>
<P>After this, I allotted to each of the fa|mily what they were to do. My daughter was particularly directed to watch her de|clining &s;i&s;ter's health; my wife was to at|tend me; my little boys were to read to me: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And as for you, my &s;on,"</Q> continu|ed I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it is by the labour of your hands we mu&s;t all hope to be &s;upported.

<P><PB N="104" REF="101">
Having thus in&s;tructed him, and &s;ettled the re&s;t, I walked down to the common pri|&s;on, where I could enjoy more air and room. But I was not long there when the execrations, lewdne&s;s, and brutality that invaded me on every &s;ide, drove me back to my apartment again. Here I &s;ate for &s;ome time, pondering upon the &s;trange in|fatuation of wretches, who finding all man|kind in open arms again&s;t them, were, however, labouring to make them&s;elves a future and a tremendous enemy.</P>
<P>Their in&s;en&s;ibility excited my highe&s;t com|pa&s;&s;ion, and blotted my own unea&s;ine&s;s a while from my mind. It even appeared as a duty incumbent upon me to attempt to reclaim them. I re&s;olved therefore once more to return, and in &s;pite of their con|tempt to give them my advice, and conquer them by per&s;everance. Going therefore among them again, I informed Mr. Jenkin|&s;on of my de&s;ign, at which he laughed,
<PB N="105" REF="102">
but communicated it to the re&s;t. The pro|po&s;al was received with the greate&s;t good|humour, as it promi&s;ed to afford a new fund of entertainment to per&s;ons who had now no other re&s;ource for mirth, but what could be derived from ridicule or debau|chery.</P>
<P>I therefore read them a portion of the &s;ervice with a loud unaffected voice, and found my audience perfectly merry upon the occa&s;ion.

<P>When I had concluded, I received the compliments of my audience, &s;ome of whom came and &s;hook me by the hand, &s;wearing that I was a very hone&s;t fellow, and that they de&s;ired my further acquain|tance. I therefore promi&s;ed to repeat my lecture next day, and actually conceived

&s;ome hopes of making a reformation here; for it had ever been my opinion, that no man was pa&s;t the hour of amendment, every heart lying open to the &s;hafts of reproof, if the archer could but take a proper aim.

He had not yet &s;een my family, for as they came to my apartment by a door in the narrow pa&s;|&s;age, already de&s;cribed, by this means they avoided the common pri&s;on.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The &s;ame &s;ubject continued.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE next morning I communicated to my wife and children the &s;cheme I had planned of reforming the pri&s;oners, which they received with univer&s;al di&s;ap|probation, alledging the impo&s;&s;ibility and impropriety of it; adding, that my endea|vours would no way contribute to their a|mendment, but might probably di&s;grace my calling.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Excu&s;e me,"</Q> returned I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the&s;e peo|ple, however fallen, are &s;till men, and that is a very good title to my affections. Good council rejected returns to enrich
<PB N="116" REF="112">
the giver's bo&s;om; and though the in|&s;truction I communicate may not mend them, yet it will a&s;&s;uredly mend my&s;elf. If the&s;e wretches, my children, were princes, there would be thou&s;ands ready to offer their mini&s;try; but, in my opini|on, the heart that is buried in a dun|geon is as precious as that &s;eated upon a throne. Yes, my trea&s;ures, if I can mend them I will; perhaps they will not all de&s;pi&s;e me. Perhaps I may catch up even one from the gulph, and that will be great gain; for is there up|on earth a gem &s;o precious as the hu|man &s;oul?"</Q></P>
<P>Thus &s;aying, I left them, and de&s;cended to the common pri&s;on, where I found the pri&s;oners very merry, expecting my arrival; and each prepared with &s;ome gaol trick to play upon the doctor. Thus, as I was go|ing to begin, one turned my wig awry, as if by accident, and then a&s;ked my pardon.
<PB N="117" REF="113">
A &s;econd, who &s;tood at &s;ome di&s;tance, had a knack of &s;pitting through his teeth, which fell in &s;howers upon my book. A third would cry amen in &s;uch an affected tone as gave the re&s;t great delight. A fourth had &s;lily picked my pocket of my &s;pectacles. But there was one who&s;e trick gave more univer&s;al plea&s;ure than all the re&s;t; for ob&s;erving the manner in which I had di&s;po&s;ed my books on the table before me, he very dextrou&s;ly di&s;placed one of them, and put an ob&s;cene je&s;t-book of his own in the place. However I took no no|tice of all that this mi&s;chievous groupe of little beings could do; but went on, per|fectly &s;en&s;ible that what was ridiculous in my attempt, would excite mirth only the fir&s;t or &s;econd time, while what was &s;erious would be permanent. My de&s;ign &s;ucceed|ed, and in le&s;s than &s;ix days &s;ome were pe|nitent, and all attentive.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="114">
It was now that I applauded my per&s;e|verance and addre&s;s, at thus giving &s;en&s;ibi|lity to wretches dive&s;ted of every moral feeling, and now began to think of doing them temporal &s;ervices al&s;o, by rendering their &s;ituation &s;omewhat more comfortable. Their time had hitherto been divided be|tween famine and exce&s;s, tumultous riot and bitter repining. Their only employ|ment was quarrelling among each other, playing cribbage, and cutting tobacco &s;top|pers. From this la&s;t mode of idle indu&s;|try I took the hint of &s;etting &s;uch as cho&s;e to work at cutting pegs for tobacconi&s;ts and &s;hoemakers, the proper wood being bought by a general &s;ub&s;cription, and when manu|factured, &s;old by my appointment; &s;o that each earned &s;omething every day: a trifle indeed, but &s;ufficient to maintain him.</P>
<P>I did not &s;top here, but in&s;tituted fines or the puni&s;hment of immorality, and re|wards for peculiar indu&s;try. Thus in le&s;s
<PB N="119" REF="115">
than a fortnight I had formed them into &s;omething &s;ocial and humane, and had the plea&s;ure of regarding my&s;elf as a legi&s;lator, who had brought men from their native fe|rocity into friend&s;hip and obedience.</P>
<P>And it were highly to be wi&s;hed, that legi&s;lative power would thus direct the law rather to reformation than &s;everity. That it would appear convinced that the work of eradicating crimes is not by making pu|ni&s;hments familiar, but formidable. In|&s;tead of our pre&s;ent pri&s;ons, which find or make men guilty, which enclo&s;e wretches for the commi&s;&s;ion of one crime, and re|turn them, if returned alive, fitted for the perpetuation of thou&s;ands; it were to be wi&s;hed we had, as in other parts of Europe, places of penitence and &s;olitude, where the accu&s;ed might be attended by &s;uch as could give them repentance if guilty, or new motives to virtue if innocent. And this, but not the increa&s;ing puni&s;hments, is the
<PB N="120" REF="116">
way to mend a &s;tate: nor can I avoid even que&s;tioning the validity of that right which &s;ocial combinations have a&s;&s;umed of capi|tally puni&s;hing offences of a &s;light nature. In ca&s;es of murder their right is obvious, as it is the duty of us all, from the law of &s;elf-defence, to cut off that man who has &s;hewn a di&s;regard for the life of another. Again&s;t &s;uch, all nature ri&s;es in arms; but it is not &s;o again&s;t him who &s;teals my pro|perty. Natural law gives me no right to take away his life, as by that the hor&s;e he &s;teals is as much his property as mine. If then I have any right, it mu&s;t be from a compact made between us, that he who de|prives the other of his hor&s;e &s;hall die. But this is a fal&s;e compact; becau&s;e no man has a right to barter his life, no more than to take it away, as it is not his own. And next the compact is inadequate, and would be &s;et a&s;ide even in a court of modern equity, as there is a great penalty for a very trifling convenience, &s;ince it is far better
<PB N="121" REF="117">
that two men &s;hould live, than that one man &s;hould ride. But a compact that is fal&s;e between two men, is equally &s;o be|tween an hundred, or an hundred thou|&s;and; for as ten millions of circles can ne|ver make a &s;quare, &s;o the united voice of myriads cannot lend the &s;malle&s;t founda|tion to fal&s;ehood. It is thus that rea&s;on &s;peaks, and untutored nature &s;ays the &s;ame thing. Savages that are directed nearly by natural law alone are very tender of the lives of each other; they &s;eldom &s;hed blood but to retaliate former cruelty.</P>
<P>Our Saxon ance&s;tors, fierce as they were in war, had but few executions in times of peace; and in all commencing govern|ments that have the print of nature &s;till &s;trong upon them, &s;carce any crime is held capital.</P>
<P>It is among the citizens of a re&s;ined community that penal laws, which are in
<PB N="122" REF="118">
the hands of the rich, are laid upon the poor. Government, while it grows older, &s;eems to acquire the moro&s;ene&s;s of age; and as if our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were become dear|er in proportion as they increa&s;ed, as if the more enormous our wealth, the more ex|ten&s;ive our fears, our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions are paled up with new edicts every day, and hung round with gibbets to &s;care every in|vader.</P>
<P>Whether is it from the number of our penal laws, or the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of our peo|ple, that this country &s;hould &s;hew more convicts in a year, than half the domini|ons of Europe united? Perhaps it is ow|ing to both; for they mutually produce each other. When by indi&s;criminate pe|nal laws a nation beholds the &s;ame puni&s;h|ment affixed to di&s;&s;imilar degrees of guilt, from perceiving no di&s;tinction in the penal|ty, the people are led to lo&s;e all &s;en&s;e of di&s;|tinction in the crime, and this di&s;tinction is
<PB N="123" REF="119">
the bulwark of all morality: thus the mul|titude of laws produce new vices, and new vices call for fre&s;h re&s;traints.</P>
<P>It were to be wi&s;hed then that power, in|&s;tead of contriving new laws to puni&s;h vice, in&s;tead of drawing hard the cords of &s;oci|ety till a convul&s;ion come to bur&s;t them, in&s;tead of cutting away wretches as u&s;ele&s;s, before we have tried their utility, in&s;tead of converting correction into vengeance, it were to be wi&s;hed that we tried the re&s;trictive arts of government, and made law the protector, but not the tyrant of the people. We &s;hould then find that creatures, who&s;e &s;ouls are held as dro&s;s, only wanted the hand of a refiner; we &s;hould then find that wretches, now &s;tuck up for long tortures, le&s;t luxury &s;hould feel a momentary pang, might, if properly treated, &s;erve to &s;inew the &s;tate in times of danger; that, as their faces are like ours, their hearts are &s;o too; that few minds are &s;o ba&s;e as that per&s;everance
<PB N="124" REF="120">
cannot amend; that a man may &s;ee his la&s;t crime without dying for it; and that very little blood will &s;erve to cement our &s;ecu|rity.</P>

<P>I Had now been confined more than a fortnight, but had not &s;ince my arrival been vi&s;ited by my dear Olivia, and I greatly longed to &s;ee her.

The numberle&s;s graces that once re&s;ided there were now fled, and the hand

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You have ever, &s;ir,"</Q> replied &s;he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"been kind to me, and it adds to my pain that I &s;hall never have an opportu|nity of &s;haring that happine&s;s you pro|mi&s;e. Happine&s;s, I fear, is no longer re&s;erved for me here; and I long to be rid of a place where I have only found di&s;tre&s;s. Indeed, &s;ir, I wi&s;h you would make a proper &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Mr. Thorn|hill;

<P>After the departure of my daughter, my fellow pri&s;oner, who was by at this inter|view, &s;en&s;ibly enough expo&s;tulated upon my ob&s;tinacy, in refu&s;ing a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, which promi&s;ed to give me freedom. He ob&s;erv|ed, that the re&s;t of my family was not to be &s;acrificed to the peace of one child

<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> replied I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you are unac|quainted with the man that oppre&s;&s;es us.

But though my &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and ap|probation could transfer me from hence, to the mo&s;t beautiful apartment he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of; yet I would grant neither, as &s;omething whi&s;pers me that it would be giving a &s;anction to adultery.

<P>For the three en&s;uing days I was in a &s;tate of anxiety, to know what reception my letter might meet with; but in the mean time was frequently &s;olicited by my wife to &s;ubmit to any conditions rather than remain here, and every hour received repea|ted accounts of the decline of my daugh|ter's health.

however, &s;till &s;upported it&s;elf though confinement and bad air began to make a vi&s;ible alteration in my health, and my arm that had &s;uffered in the fire, grew wor&s;e.

But my daughter's health declined fa&s;ter than mine; every me&s;&s;age from her contributed to encrea&s;e my apprehen&s;ions and pain. The fifth morning after I had written the letter which was &s;ent to &s;ir William Thornhill, I was alarmed with an account that &s;he was &s;peechle&s;s.

</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<PB REF="146">
<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The equal dealings of providence demon|&s;trated with regard to the happy and the mi&s;erable here below. That from the nature of plea&s;ure and pain, the wretch|ed mu&s;t be repaid the balance of their &s;ufferings in the life hereafter.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MY friends, my children, and fellow &s;ufferers, when I reflect on the di|&s;tribution of good and evil here below, I find that much has been given man to en|joy, yet &s;till more to &s;uffer. Though we &s;hould examine the whole world, we &s;hall not find one man &s;o happy as to have no|thing left to wi&s;h for; but we daily &s;ee thou&s;ands who by &s;uicide &s;hew us they
<PB N="152" REF="147">
have nothing left to hope. In this life then it appears that we cannot be entirely ble&s;t; but yet we may be completely mi&s;erable!</P>
<P>Why man &s;hould thus feel pain, why our wretchedne&s;s &s;hould be requi&s;ite in the formation of univer&s;al felicity, why, when all other &s;y&s;tems are made perfect only by the perfection of their &s;ubordinate parts, the great &s;y&s;tem &s;hould require for its perfection, parts that are not only &s;ubordinate to others, but imperfect in them&s;elves? The&s;e are que&s;tions that never can be explained, and might be u&s;ele&s;s if known. On this &s;ubject providence has thought fit to elude our cu|rio&s;ity, &s;atisfied with granting us motives to con&s;olation.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, man has called in the friendly a&s;&s;i&s;tance of philo&s;ophy, and hea|ven &s;eeing the incapacity of that to con&s;ole him, has given him the aid of religion.
<PB N="153" REF="148">
The con&s;olations of philo&s;ophy are very amu&s;ing, but often fallacious. It tells us that life is filled with comforts, if we will but enjoy them; and on the other hand, that though we unavoidably have mi|&s;eries here, life is &s;hort, and they will &s;oon be over. Thus do the&s;e con&s;olations de&s;troy each other; for if life is a place of comfort, its &s;hortne&s;s mu&s;t be mi&s;ery, and if it be long, our griefs are protracted. Thus philo&s;ophy is weak; but religi|on comforts in an higher &s;train. Man is here, it tells us, fitting up his mind, and preparing it for another abode. When the good man leaves the body and is all a glorious mind, he will find he has been making him&s;elf a heaven of happine&s;s here, while the wretch that has been maimed and contaminated by his vices, &s;hrinks from his body with terror, and finds that he has anticipated the vengeance of
<PB N="154" REF="149">
heaven. To religion then we mu&s;t hold in every circum&s;tance of life for our true&s;t comfort; for if already we are happy, it is a plea&s;ure to think that we can make that happine&s;s unending, and if we are mi&s;era|ble, it is very con&s;oling to think that there is a place of re&s;t. Thus to the fortu|nate religion holds out a continuance of bli&s;s, to the wretched a change from pain.</P>
<P>But though religion is very kind to all men, it has promi&s;ed peculiar reward to the unhappy; the &s;ick, the naked, the hou&s;ele&s;s, the heavy-laden, and the pri&s;oner, have ever mo&s;t frequent promi&s;es in our &s;a|cred law. The author of our religion every where profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf the wretch's friend, and unlike the fal&s;e ones of this world, be&s;tows all his care&s;&s;es upon the for|lorn. The unthinking have cen&s;ured this as partiality, as a preference with|out
<PB N="155" REF="150">
merit to de&s;erve it. But they never re|flect that it is not in the power even of heaven it&s;elf to make the offer of uncea&s;|ing felicity as great a gift to the happy as to the mi&s;erable. To the fir&s;t eternity is but a &s;ingle ble&s;&s;ing, &s;ince at mo&s;t it but encrea&s;es what they already po&s;&s;e&s;s. To the latter it is a double advantage; for it dimi|ni&s;hes their pain here, and rewards them with heavenly bli&s;s hereafter.</P>
<P>But providence is in another re&s;pect kind|er to the poor than the rich; for as it thus makes the life after death more de&s;irable, &s;o it &s;mooths the pa&s;&s;age there. The wretch|ed have long familiarity with every face of terror. The man of &s;orrows lays him&s;elf quietly down, he has no po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to re|gret, and but few ties to &s;top his departure: he feels only nature's pang in the final &s;eparation, and this is no way greater than he has often fainted under before; for after a certain degree of pain, every
<PB N="156" REF="151">
new breach that death opens in the con|&s;titution, nature kindly covers with in&s;en&s;i|bility.</P>
<P>Thus providence has given the wretched two advantages over the happy in this life, greater felicity in dying, and in heaven all that &s;uperiority of plea&s;ure which ari&s;es from contra&s;ted enjoyment. And this &s;uperiority, my friends, is no &s;mall advantage, and &s;eems to be one of the plea&s;ures of the poor man in the parable; for though he was already in heaven, and felt all the rap|tures it could give, yet it was mentioned as an addition to his happine&s;s, that he had once been wretched and now was comfort|ed, that he had known what it was to be mi&s;erable, and now felt what it was to be happy.</P>
<P>Thus, my friends, you &s;ee religion does what phil&s;ophy could never do: it &s;hews the equal dealings of heaven to the happy
<PB N="157" REF="152">
and the unhappy, and levels all human enjoyments to nearly the &s;ame &s;tandard. It gives to both rich and poor the &s;ame happine&s;s hereafter, and equal hopes to a&s;pire after it; but if the rich have the advantage of enjoying plea&s;ure here, the poor have the endle&s;s &s;atisfaction of know|ing what it was once to be mi&s;erable, when crowned with endle&s;s felicity here|after; and even though this &s;hould be called a &s;mall advantage, yet being an eternal one, it mu&s;t make up by duration what the temporal happine&s;s of the great may have exceeded by in|ten&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e are therefore the con&s;olations which the wretched have peculiar to them|&s;elves, and in which they are above the re&s;t of mankind; in other re&s;pects they are below them. They who would know the mi&s;eries of the poor mu&s;t &s;ee life and endure it.
<PB N="158" REF="153">
To declaim on the temporal advantages they enjoy, is only repeating what none ei|ther believe or practi&s;e. The men who have the nece&s;&s;aries of living are not poor, and they who want them mu&s;t be mi&s;erable. Yes, my friends, we mu&s;t be mi&s;erable. No vain efforts of a refined imagination can &s;ooth the wants of nature, can give ela&s;tic &s;weetne&s;s to the dank vapour of a dungeon, or ea&s;e to the throbbings of a woe-worn heart. Let the philo&s;opher from his couch of &s;oftne&s;s tell us that we can re&s;i&s;t all the&s;e. Alas! the effort by which we re&s;i&s;t them is &s;till the greate&s;t pain! Death is &s;light, and any man may &s;u&s;tain it; but torments are dreadful, and the&s;e no man can endure.</P>
<P>To us then, my friends, the promi&s;es of happine&s;s in heaven &s;hould be peculiarly dear; for if our reward be in this life alone, we are then indeed of all men the mo&s;t mi&s;erable.

<P>WHEN I had thus fini&s;hed and my au|dience was retired, the gaoler, who was one of the mo&s;t humane of his pro|fe&s;&s;ion, hoped I would not be di&s;plea&s;ed, as what he did was but his duty, ob&s;erving that he mu&s;t be obliged to remove my &s;on into a &s;tronger cell, but that he &s;hould be permitted to revi&s;it me every morning. I thanked him for his clemency, and gra&s;p|ing my boy's hand, bade him farewell, and be mindful of the great duty that was be|fore him.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="158">
I again, therefore laid me down, and one of my little ones &s;ate by my bed&s;ide read|ing, when Mr. Jenkin&s;on entering, inform|ed me that there was news of my daugh|ter; for that &s;he was &s;een by a per&s;on about two hours before in a &s;trange gentleman's company, and that they had &s;topt at a neighbouring village for refre&s;hment, and &s;eemed as if returning to town. He had &s;carce delivered this news, when the gaoler came with looks of ha&s;te and plea&s;ure, to inform me, that my daughter was found. Mo&s;es came running in a moment after, crying out that his &s;i&s;ter Sophy was below and coming up with our old friend Mr. Burchell.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as he delivered this news my deare&s;t girl entered, and with looks almo&s;t wild with plea&s;ure, ran to ki&s;s me in a tran&s;port of affection. Her mother's tears and &s;ilence al&s;o &s;hewed her plea&s;ure.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Here, pappa,"</Q>

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ah, Mr. Burchell,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"this is but a wretched habitation you now find us in; and we are now very different from what you la&s;t &s;aw us. You were ever our friend: we have long di&s;covered our errors with regard to you, and repented of our ingratitude. After the vile u&s;age you then received at my hands, I am al|mo&s;t a&s;hamed to behold your face; yet I hope you'll forgive me, as I was de|ceived by a ba&s;e ungenerous wretch, who, under the ma&s;k of friend&s;hip, has un|done me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is impo&s;&s;ible,"</Q> replied Mr. Burchell. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that I &s;hould forgive you, as you never

de&s;erved my re&s;entment. I partly &s;aw your delu&s;ion then, and as it was out of my power to re&s;train, I could only pity it!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It was ever my conjecture,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that your mind was noble; but now I find it &s;o. But tell me, my dear child, how ha&s;t thou been relieved, or who the ruffians were who carried thee away?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Indeed, Sir,"</Q> replied &s;he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"as to the villain who brought me off, I am yet ig|nor ut. For as my mamma and I were walking out, he came behind us, and almo&s;t before I could call for help, for|ced me into the po&s;t-chai&s;e, and in an in|&s;tant the hor&s;es drove away. I met &s;e|veral on the road, to whom I cried out for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but they di&s;regarded my entreaties. In the mean time the ruffian him&s;elf u&s;ed every art to hinder me from crying out: he flattered and threatened
<PB N="167" REF="161">
by turns, and &s;wore that if I continued but &s;ilent, he intended no harm. In the mean time I had broken the canvas that he had drawn up, and whom &s;hould I perceive at &s;ome di&s;tance but your old friend Mr. Burchell, walking along with his u&s;ual &s;wiftne&s;s, with the great &s;tick for which we u&s;ed &s;o much to ridicule him. As &s;oon as we came within hear|ing, I called out to him by name, and entreated his help. I repeated my ex|clamations &s;everal times, upon which, with a very loud voice, he bid the po&s;|tillion &s;top; but the boy took no notice, but drove on with &s;till greater &s;peed. I now thought he could never overtake us, when in le&s;s than a minute I &s;aw Mr. Burchell come running up by the &s;ide of the hor&s;es, and with one blow knock the po&s;tillion to the ground. The hor&s;es when he was fallen &s;oon &s;topt of them|&s;elves, and the ruffian &s;tepping out, with oaths and menaces drew his &s;word, and
<PB N="168" REF="162">
ordered him at his peril to retire; but Mr. Burchell running up, &s;hivered his &s;word to pieces, and then pur&s;ued him for near a quarter of a mile; but he made his e&s;cape. I was at this time come out my&s;elf, willing to a&s;&s;i&s;t my de|liverer; but he &s;oon returned to me in triumph. The po&s;tillion, who was re|covered, was going to make his e&s;cape too; but Mr. Burchell ordered him at his peril to mount again, and drive back to town. Finding it impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t, he reluctantly complied, though the wound he had received &s;eemed, to me at lea&s;t, to be dangerous. He continued to complain of the pain as we drove a|long, &s;o that he at la&s;t excited Mr. Bur|chell's compa&s;&s;ion, who, at my reque&s;t, exchanged him for another at an inn where we called on our return."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Welcome then,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"my child, and thou her gallant deliverer, a thou&s;and

And now, Mr. Burchell, as you have delivered my girl, if you think her a recompence &s;he is yours, if you can &s;toop to an alliance with a family &s;o poor as mine, take her, obtain her con&s;ent, as I know you have her heart, and you have mine. And let me tell you, Sir, that I give you no &s;mall trea&s;ure, &s;he has been celebrated for beauty it is true, but that is not my meaning, I give you up a trea&s;ure in her mind."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But I &s;uppo&s;e, Sir,"</Q> cried Mr. Burchell, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that you are apprized of my circum&s;tances, and of my incapacity to &s;upport her as &s;he de&s;erves?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If your pre&s;ent objection,"</Q> replied I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"be meant as an eva&s;ion of my offer, I de&s;i&s;t: but I know no man &s;o worthy to de&s;erve her as you; and if I could give

her thou&s;ands, and thou&s;ands &s;ought her from me, yet my hone&s;t brave Burchell &s;hould be my deare&s;t choice."</Q></P>
<P>To all this his &s;ilence alone &s;eemed to give a mortifying refu&s;al, and without the lea&s;t reply to my offer, he demanded if we could not be furni&s;hed with refre&s;hments from the next inn, to which being an&s;wered in the affirmative, he ordered them to &s;end in the be&s;t dinner that could be provided upon &s;uch &s;hort notice. He be&s;poke al&s;o a do|zen of their be&s;t wine; and &s;ome cordials for me. Adding, with a &s;mile, that he would &s;tretch a little for once, and tho' in a pri&s;on, a&s;&s;erted he was never better di&s;po&s;ed to be merry. The waiter &s;oon made his appearance with preparations for dinner, a table was lent us by the gaoler, who &s;eemed remarkably a&s;&s;iduous, the wine was di&s;po&s;ed in order, and two very well|dre&s;t di&s;hes were brought in.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="165">
My daughter had not yet heard of her poor brother's melancholy &s;ituation, and we all &s;eemed unwilling to damp her chearful|ne&s;s by the relation. But it was in vain that I attempted to appear chearful, the cir|cum&s;tances of my unfortunate &s;on broke through all efforts to di&s;&s;emble; &s;o that I I was at la&s;t obliged to damp our mirth by relating his misfortunes, and wi&s;hing that he might be permitted to &s;hare with us in this little interval of &s;atisfaction. After my gue&s;ts were recovered from the con&s;terna|tion my account had produced, I reque&s;ted al&s;o that Mr. Jenkin&s;on, a fellow pri&s;oner, might be admitted, and the gaoler granted my reque&s;t with an air of unu&s;ual &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion. The clanking of my &s;on's irons was no &s;ooner heard along the pa&s;&s;age, than his &s;i&s;ter ran impatiently to meet him; while Mr. Burchell, in the mean time, a&s;ked me if my &s;on's name were George, to which replying in the affirmative, he &s;till continued &s;ilent. As &s;oon as my boy entered the

<P>My &s;on &s;eemed all this while regardle&s;s of what I &s;aid, and &s;till continued fixed at re&s;pectful di&s;tance.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My dear brother,"</Q> cried his &s;i&s;ter, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"why don't you thank my good deliverer; the brave &s;hould ever love each other."</Q></P>

<P>We now &s;ate down to dinner, which was almo&s;t cold; but previou&s;ly, my arm &s;till continuing painful, Sir William wrote a pre&s;cription, for he had made the &s;tudy of phy&s;ic his amu&s;ement, and was more than moderately &s;killed in the profe&s;&s;ion: this being &s;ent to an apothecary who lived in the place, my arm was dre&s;&s;ed, and I found almo&s;t in&s;tantaneous relief.

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If this,"</Q> cried Sir William, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"be as you have &s;tated it, there is nothing un|pardonable in your offence, and though your conduct might have been more ge|nerous in not &s;uffering this gentleman to be oppre&s;&s;ed by &s;ubordinate tyranny, yet it has been at lea&s;t equitable."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="179">
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He cannot contradict a &s;ingle particu|lar,"</Q> replied the 'Squire, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I defy him to do &s;o, and &s;everal of my &s;ervants are ready to atte&s;t what I &s;ay. Thus, Sir,"</Q> continued he, finding that I was &s;ilent, for in fact I could not contradict him, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"thus, Sir, my own innocence is vindicated; but though at your entreaty I am ready to for|give this gentleman every other offence, yet his attempts to le&s;&s;en me in your e|&s;teem, excite a re&s;entment that I cannot govern. And this too at a time when his &s;on was actually preparing to take away my life; this, I &s;ay, was &s;uch guilt, that I am determined to let the law take its cour&s;e. I have here the challenge that was &s;ent me and two witne&s;&s;es to prove it; and even though my uncle him&s;elf &s;hould di&s;&s;uade me, which I know he will not, yet I will &s;ee public ju&s;tice done, and he &s;hall &s;uffer for it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Thou mon&s;ter,"</Q> cried my wife, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"ha&s;t thou not had vengeance enough al|ready,

<P><Q REND="inline">"Madam,"</Q> replied the good man, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"your wi&s;hes for his &s;afety are not greater than mine; but I am &s;orry to find his guilt too plain; and if my nephew per|&s;i&s;ts&mdash;"</Q>But the appearance of Jen|kin&s;on and the gaoler's two &s;ervants now called off our attention, who entered, haling in a tall man, very genteelly dre&s;t, and an&s;wering the de&s;cription al|ready given of the ruffian who had carried off my daughter&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Here,"</Q> cried Jen|kin&s;on, pulling him in, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"here we have him, and if ever there was a candidate for tyburn, this is one."</Q></P>
<P>The moment Mr. Thornhill perceived the pri&s;oner, and Jenkin&s;on, who had him
<PB N="188" REF="181">
in cu&s;tody, he &s;eemed to &s;hrink back with terror. His face became pale with con&s;ci|ous guilt, and he would have withdrawn; but Jenkin&s;on, who perceived his de&s;ign, &s;topt him&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What, 'Squire,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"are you a&s;hamed of your two old acquain|tances, Jenkin&s;on and Baxter: but this is the way that all great men forget their friends, though I am re&s;olved we will not forget you. Our pri&s;oner, plea&s;e your honour,"</Q> continued he, turning to Sir William, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"has already confe&s;&s;ed all. He declares that it was Mr. Thornhill who fir&s;t put him upon this affair, that he gave him the cloaths he now wears to appear like a gentleman, and furni&s;hed him with the po&s;t-chai&s;e. The plan was laid be|tween them that he &s;hould carry off the young lady to a place of &s;afety, and that there he &s;hould threaten and terrify her; but Mr. Thornhill was to come in in the mean time, as if by accident, to her re&s;cue, and that they &s;hould fight awhile
<PB N="189" REF="182">
and then he was to run off, by which Mr. Thornhill would have the better op|portunity of gaining her affections him|&s;elf under the character of her defender."</Q></P>
<P>Sir William remembered the coat to have been frequently worn by his nephew, and all the re&s;t the pri&s;oner him&s;elf confirmed by a more circum&s;tantial account; concluding, that Mr. Thornhill had often declared to him that he was in love with both &s;i&s;ters at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Heavens,"</Q> cried Sir William, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"what a viper have I been fo&s;tering in my bo|&s;om! And &s;o fond of public ju&s;tice too as he &s;eemed to be. But he &s;hall have it; &s;ecure him, Mr. Gaoler&mdash;yet hold, I fear there is not legal evidence to de|tain him."</Q></P>
<P>Upon this, Mr. Thornhill, with the ut|mo&s;t humility, entreated that two &s;uch a|bandoned wretches might not be admitted

as evidences again&s;t him, but that his &s;er|vants &s;hould be examined.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Your &s;er|vants,"</Q> replied Sir William, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"wretch, call them yours no longer: but come let us hear what tho&s;e fellows have to &s;ay, let his butler be called."</Q></P>
<P>When the butler was introduced, he &s;oon perceived by his former ma&s;ter's looks that all his power was now over. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Tell me,"</Q> cried Sir William &s;ternly, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"have you ever &s;een your ma&s;ter and that fellow dre&s;t up in his cloaths in company together?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes"> "Yes, plea&s;e your honour,"</Q> cried the butler, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a thou&s;and times: he was the man that always brought him his ladies."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"How,"</Q> interrupted young Mr. Thornhill, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"this to my face!"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> replied the butler, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"or to any man's face.

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Good heavens!"</Q> exclaimed the Baronet, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"how every new di&s;covery of his villainy
<PB N="192" REF="185">
alarms me. All his guilt is now too plain, and I find his pre&s;ent pro&s;ecution was dictated by tyranny, cowardice and revenge; at my reque&s;t, Mr. Gaoler, &s;et this young officer, now your pri&s;oner, free, and tru&s;t to me for the con&s;equences. I'll make it my bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;et the affair in a proper light to my friend the magi&s;trate who has committed him. But where is the unfortunate young lady her&s;elf: let her appear to confront this wretch, I long to know by what arts he has &s;educed her honour. Entreat her to come in. Where is &s;he?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ah, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that que&s;tion &s;tings me to the heart: I was once indeed hap|py in a daughter, but her mi&s;eries&mdash;"</Q>Another interruption here prevented me; for who &s;hould make her appearance but Mi&s;s Arabella Wilmot, who was next day to have been married to Mr. Thornhill. Nothing could equal her &s;urprize at &s;eeing
<PB N="193" REF="186">
Sir William and his nephew here before her; for her arrival was quite accidental. It happened that &s;he and the old gentle|man her father were pa&s;&s;ing through the town, on their way to her aunt's, who had in&s;i&s;ted that her nuptials with Mr. Thorn|hill &s;hould be con&s;ummated at her hou&s;e; but &s;topping for refre&s;hment, they put up at an inn at the other end of the town. It was there from the window that the young lady happened to ob&s;erve one of my little boys playing in the &s;treet, and in&s;tantly &s;ending a footman to bring the child to her, &s;he learnt from him &s;ome account of our misfortunes; but was &s;till kept igno|rant of young Mr. Thornhill's being the cau&s;e. Though her father made &s;everal remon&s;trances on the impropriety of going to a pri&s;on to vi&s;it us, yet they were ineffectual; &s;he de&s;ired the child to conduct her, which he did, and it was thus &s;he &s;ur|pri&s;ed us at a juncture &s;o unexpected.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="187">
Nor can I go on, without a reflection on tho&s;e accidental meetings, which, though they happen every day, &s;eldom excite our &s;urprize but upon &s;ome extraordinary occa|&s;ion. To what a fortuitous concurrence do we not owe every plea&s;ure and convenience of our lives. How many &s;eeming accidents mu&s;t unite before we can be cloathed or fed. The pea&s;ant mu&s;t be di&s;po&s;ed to la|bour, the &s;hower mu&s;t fall, the wind fill the merchant's &s;ail, or numbers mu&s;t want the u&s;ual &s;upply.</P>
<P>We all continued &s;ilent for &s;ome mo|ments, while my charming pupil, which was the name I generally gave this young lady, united in her looks compa&s;&s;ion and a&s;toni&s;hment, which gave new fini&s;hings to her beauty. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Indeed, my dear Mr. Thorn|hill,"</Q> cried &s;he to the 'Squire, who &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed was come here to &s;uccour and not to oppre&s;s us. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I take it a little un|kindly that you &s;hould come here with|out

But I find that, like your uncle, you take a plea&s;ure in doing good in &s;ecret."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He find plea&s;ure in doing good!"</Q> cri|ed Sir William, interrupting her. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No, my dear, his plea&s;ures are as ba&s;e as he is. You &s;ee in him, madam, as com|plete a villain as ever di&s;graced humanity. A wretch, who after having deluded this poor man's daughter, after plotting again&s;t the innocence of her &s;i&s;ter, has thrown the father into pri&s;on, and the elde&s;t &s;on into fetters, becau&s;e he had courage to face his betrayer. And give me leave, madam, now to congratulate you upon an e&s;cape from the embraces of &s;uch a mon&s;ter."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="189">
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O goodne&s;s,"</Q> cried the lovely girl, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"how have I been deceived! Mr. Thornhill informed me for certain that this gentle|man's elde&s;t &s;on, Captain Primro&s;e, was gone off to America with his new-married lady."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My &s;weete&s;t mi&s;s,"</Q> cried my wife, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he has told you nothing but fal&s;e|hoods. My &s;on George never left the kingdom, nor never was married. Tho' you have for&s;aken him, he has al|ways loved you too well to think of any body el&s;e; and I have heard him &s;ay he would die a batchellor for your &s;ake."</Q> She then proceeded to expatiate upon the &s;incerity of her &s;on's pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he &s;et his duel with Mr. Thornhill in a proper light, from thence &s;he made a rapid digre&s;&s;ion to the 'Squire's debaucheries, his pretended marri|ages, and ended with a mo&s;t in&s;ulting pic|ture of his cowardice.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="190">
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Good heavens!"</Q> cried Mi&s;s Wilmot, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"how very near have, I been to the brink of ruin! But how great is my plea&s;ure to have e&s;caped it! Ten thou&s;and fal&s;e|hoods has this gentleman told me! He had at la&s;t art enough to per&s;uade me that my promi&s;e to the only man I e&s;teemed was no longer binding, &s;ince he had been un|faithful. By his fal&s;ehoods I was taught to dete&s;t one equally brave and gene|rous!"</Q></P>
<P>But by this time my &s;on was freed from the incumbrances of ju&s;tice. Mr. Jenkin|&s;on al&s;o, who had acted as his valet de chambre, had dre&s;&s;ed up his hair, and fur|ni&s;hed him with whatever was nece&s;&s;ary to make a genteel appearance. He now there|fore entered, hand&s;omely dre&s;t in his re|gimentals, and, without vanity, (for I am above it) he appeared as hand&s;ome a fellow as ever wore a military dre&s;s.
<PB N="198" REF="191">
As he entered, he made Mi&s;s Wilmot a mo|de&s;t and di&s;tant bow, for he was not as yet acquainted with the change which the eloquence of his mother had wrought in his favour. But no decorums could re|&s;train the impatience of his blu&s;hing mi&s;|tre&s;s to be forgiven. Her tears, her looks, all contributed to di&s;cover the real &s;en&s;ations of her heart for having forgotten her former promi&s;e and having &s;uffered her&s;elf to be deluded by an impo&s;tor. My &s;on appeared amazed at her conde&s;cen&s;ion, and could &s;carce believe it real.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sure, madam,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"this is but delu&s;ion! I can ne|ver have merited this! To be ble&s;t thus is to be too happy."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No, Sir,"</Q> re|plied &s;he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have been deceived, ba&s;ely deceived, el&s;e nothing could have ever made me unju&s;t to my promi&s;e. You know my friend&s;hip, you have long known it; but forget what I have done, and as you once had my warme&s;t vows of
<PB N="199" REF="192">
con&s;tancy, you &s;hall now have them repeated; and be a&s;&s;ured that if your Arabella cannot be yours, &s;he &s;hall never be another's."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And no other's you &s;hall be,"</Q> cried Sir William, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"if I have any influence with your father."</Q></P>
<P>This hint was &s;ufficient for my &s;on Mo&s;es, who immediately flew to the inn where the old gentleman was, to inform him of eve|ry circum&s;tance that had happened. But in the mean time the 'Squire perceiving that he was on every &s;ide undone, now finding that no hopes were left from flattery or di&s;&s;imulation, concluded that his wi&s;e&s;t way would be to turn and face his pur&s;uers. Thus laying a&s;ide all &s;hame, he appeared the open hardy villain. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I find then,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that I am to expect no ju&s;tice here; but I am re&s;olved it &s;hall be done me. You &s;hall know, Sir,"</Q> turning to Sir William, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am no
<PB N="200" REF="193">
longer a poor dependant upon your fa|vours. I &s;corn them. Nothing can keep Mi&s;s Wilmot's fortune from me, which, I thank her father's a&s;&s;iduity, is pretty large. The articles, and a bond for her fortune, are &s;igned, and &s;afe in my po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion. It was her fortune, not her per|&s;on, that induced me to wi&s;h for this match, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the one, let who&s;e will take the other."</Q></P>
<P>This was an alarming blow, Sir Willi|am was &s;en&s;ible of the ju&s;tice of his claims, for he had been in&s;trumental in drawing up the marriage articles him&s;elf. Mi&s;s Wil|mot therefore perceiving that her fortune was irretrievably lo&s;t, turning to my &s;on, &s;he a&s;ked if the lo&s;s of fortune could le&s;&s;en her value to him. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Though fortune,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is out of my power, at lea&s;t I have my hand to give."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="194">
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And that, madam,"</Q> cried her real lover, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"was indeed all that you ever had to give; at lea&s;t all that I ever thought worth the acceptance. And I now prote&s;t, my Arabella, by all that's happy, your want of fortune this moment encrea&s;es my plea&s;ure, as it &s;erves to convince my &s;weet girl of my &s;incerity."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Wilmot now entering, he &s;eemed not a little plea&s;ed at the danger his daugh|ter had ju&s;t e&s;caped, and readily con&s;ented to a di&s;&s;olution of the match. But finding that her fortune, which was &s;ecured to Mr. Thornhill by bond, would not be given up, nothing could exceed his di&s;appointment. He now &s;aw that his money mu&s;t all go to enrich one who had no fortune of his own. He could bear his being a ra&s;cal; but to want an equivalent to his daughter's fortune was wormwood. He &s;ate therefore for &s;ome minutes employed in the mo&s;t mortifying &s;peculations, till Sir William attempted to
<PB N="202" REF="195">
le&s;&s;en his anxiety.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I mu&s;t confe&s;s, Sir,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that your pre&s;ent di&s;appoint|ment does not entirely di&s;plea&s;e me. Your immoderate pa&s;&s;ion for wealth is now ju&s;tly puni&s;hed. But tho' the young lady cannot be rich, &s;he has &s;till a com|petence &s;ufficient to give content. Here you &s;ee an hone&s;t young &s;oldier, who is wil|ling to take her without fortune; they have long loved each other, and for the friend&s;hip I bear his father, my intere&s;t &s;hall not be wanting for his promotion. Leave then that ambition which di&s;ap|points you, and for once admit hap|happine&s;s which courts your acceptance."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sir William,"</Q> replied the old gentle|man, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"be a&s;&s;ured I never yet forced her inclinations, nor will I now. If &s;he &s;till continues to love this young gentleman, let her have him with all my heart. There is &s;till, thank heaven, &s;ome fortune left, and your promi&s;e will make it

&s;omething more. Only let my old friend here (meaning me) give me a promi&s;e of &s;ettling &s;ix thou&s;and pounds upon my girl, if ever he &s;hould come to his fortune, and I am ready this night to be the fir&s;t to join them toge|ther."</Q></P>
<P>As it now remained with me to make the young couple happy, I readi|ly gave a promi&s;e of making the &s;ettle|ment he required, which, to one who had &s;uch little expectations as I, was no great favour. We had now therefore the &s;ati&s;|faction of &s;eeing them fly into each other's arms in a tran&s;port. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"After all my misfor|tunes,"</Q> cried my &s;on George, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to be thus rewarded!

That there 'Squire of renown, for whom I have a great friend&s;hip, but that's between our&s;elves, has often employed me in doing odd lit|tle things for him. Among the re&s;t, he commi&s;&s;ioned me to procure him a fal&s;e licence and a fal&s;e prie&s;t, in order to de|ceive this young lady. But as I was very much his friend, what did I do but went and got a true licence and a true prie&s;t,
<PB N="208" REF="201">
and married them both as fa&s;t as the cloth could make them. Perhaps you'll think it was genero&s;ity that made me do all this. But no. To my &s;hame I confe&s;s it, my only de&s;ign was to keep the licence and let the 'Squire know that I could prove it upon him whenever I thought proper, and &s;o make him come down whenever I wanted money."</Q> A bur&s;t of plea&s;ure now &s;eemed to fill the whole apart|ment; our joy reached even to the com|mon room, where the pri&s;oners them&s;elves &s;ympathized,<Q><L><HI>And &s;hook their chains</HI></L>
<L><HI>In tran&s;port and rude harmony.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Happine&s;s expanded upon every face, and even Olivia's cheek &s;eemed flu&s;hed with plea&s;ure. To be thus re&s;tored to reputa|tion, to friends and fortune at once, was a rapture &s;ufficient to &s;top the progre&s;s of de|cay and re&s;tore former health and vivacity. But perhaps among all there was not one
<PB N="209" REF="202">
who felt &s;incerer plea&s;ure than I. Still holding the dear-loved child in my arms, I a&s;ked my heart if the&s;e tran&s;ports were not delu&s;ion. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">How could you,"</Q> cried I, turn|ing to Mr. Jenkin&s;on, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"how could you add to my mi&s;eries by the &s;tory of her death! But it matters not, my plea&s;ure at finding her again, is more than a recom|pence for the pain."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As to your que&s;tion,"</Q> replied Jenkin|&s;on, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that is ea&s;ily an&s;wered. I thought the only probable means of freeing you from pri&s;on, was by &s;ubmitting to the 'Squire, and con&s;enting to his marriage with the other young lady. But the&s;e you had vowed never to grant while your daughter was living, there was therefore no other method to bring things to bear but by per&s;uading you that &s;he was dead. I prevailed on your wi&s;e to join in the de|ceit, and we have not had a fit oppor|tunity of undeceiving you till now."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="203">
In the whole a&s;&s;embly now there only ap|peared two faces that did not glow with tran&s;port. Mr. Thornhill's a&s;&s;urance had entirely for&s;aken him: he now &s;aw the gulph of infamy and want before him, and trembled to take the plunge. He therefore fell on his knees before his uncle, and in a voice of piercing mi&s;ery implored compa&s;|&s;ion. Sir William was going to &s;purn him away, but at my reque&s;t he rai&s;ed him, and after pau&s;ing a few moments, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Thy vices, crimes, and ingratitude,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"de|&s;erve no tenderne&s;s; yet thou &s;halt not be entirely for&s;aken, a bare competence &s;hall be &s;upplied, to &s;upport the wants of life, but not its follies. This young lady, thy wife, &s;hall be put in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of a third part of that fortune which once was thine, and from her ten|derne&s;s alone thou art to expect any extraordinary &s;upplies for the future."</Q> He was going to expre&s;s his gratitude for &s;uch kindne&s;s in a &s;et &s;peech; but the
<PB N="211" REF="204">
Baronet prevented him by bidding him not aggravate his meanne&s;s, which was already but too apparent. He ordered him at the &s;ame time to be gone, and from all his for|mer dome&s;tics to chu&s;e one &s;uch as he &s;hould think proper, which was all that &s;hould be granted to attend him.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he left us, Sir William very politely &s;tept up to his new niece with a a &s;mile, and wi&s;hed her joy. His example was followed by Mi&s;s Wilmot and her fa|ther; my wife too ki&s;&s;ed her daughter with much affection, as, to u&s;e her own expre&s;&s;ion, &s;he was now made an hone&s;t woman of. So|phia and Mo&s;es followed in turn, and even our benefactor Jenkin&s;on de&s;ired to be ad|mitted to that honour. Our &s;atisfaction &s;eemed &s;carce capable of increa&s;e. Sir Wil|liam, who&s;e greate&s;t plea&s;ure was in doing good, now looked round with a counte|nance open as the &s;un, and &s;aw nothing but joy in the looks of all except that of

my daughter Sophia, who, for &s;ome rea|&s;ons we could not comprehend, did not &s;eem perfectly &s;atisfied. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I think now,"</Q> cried he, with a &s;mile, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that all the com|pany, except one or two, &s;eem perfectly happy.

Come, Mi&s;s Sophia, what &s;ay you to this match of my making? Will you have him?"</Q>&mdash;My poor girl &s;eemed almo&s;t &s;inking into her mother's arms at the hideous propo&s;al.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Have him, Sir!"</Q> cried &s;he faintly. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No, Sir, never."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">What,"</Q> cried he again,

could think that I had merit as a man. After having tried in vain, even among&s;t the pert and the ugly, how great at la&s;t mu&s;t be my rapture to have made a conque&s;t over &s;uch &s;en&s;e and &s;uch hea|venly beauty."</Q> Then turning to Jen|kin&s;on, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As I cannot, Sir, part with this young lady my&s;elf, for &s;he has taken a fancy to the cut of my face, all the re|compence I can make is to give you her fortune, and you may call upon my &s;tew|ard to-morrow for five hundred pounds."</Q> Thus we had all our compliments to re|peat, and Lady Thornhill underwent the &s;ame round of ceremony that her &s;i&s;ters had done before. In the mean time Sir Willi|am's gentleman appeared to tell us that the equipages were ready to carry us to the inn, where every thing was prepared for our reception. My wife and I led the van, and left tho&s;e gloomy man&s;ions of &s;orrow. The generous Baronet ordered forty pounds to be di&s;tributed among the pri&s;oners, and
<PB N="215" REF="208">
Mr. Wilmot, induced by his example, gave half that &s;um. We were received be|low by the &s;houts of the villagers, and I &s;aw and &s;hook by the hand two or three of my hone&s;t pari&s;hioners, who were among the number.

<P>After &s;upper, as my &s;pirits were exhau&s;ted by the alternation of plea&s;ure and pain which they had &s;u&s;tained during the day, I a&s;ked permi&s;&s;ion to withdraw, and leaving the company in the mid&s;t of their mirth, as &s;oon as I found my&s;elf alone, I poured out my heart in gratitude to the giver of joy as well as of &s;orrow, and then &s;lept undi&s;turbed till morning.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Conclu&s;ion.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE next morning as &s;oon as I awaked I found my elde&s;t &s;on &s;itting by my bed&s;ide, who came to encrea&s;e my joy with another turn of fortune in my favour. Fir&s;t having relea&s;ed me from the &s;ettlement that I had made the day before in his favour, he let me know that my merchant who had failed in town was arre&s;ted at Antwerp, and there had given up effects to a much greater amount than what was due to his creditors. My boy's genero&s;ity plea&s;ed me almo&s;t as much as this unlooked for good fortune. But I had &s;ome doubts whether I
<PB N="218" REF="210">
ought in ju&s;tice to accept his offer. While I was pondering upon this, Sir William en|tered the room, to whom I communicated my doubts. His opinion was, that as my &s;on was already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a very affluent fortune by his marriage, I might accept his offer without any he&s;itation. His bu&s;ine&s;s, however, was to inform me that as he had the night before &s;ent for the licences, and ex|pected them every hour, he hoped that I would not refu&s;e my a&s;&s;i&s;tance in making all the company happy that morning. A footman entered while we were &s;peaking, to tell us that the me&s;&s;enger was returned, and as I was by this time ready, I went down, where I found the whole company as merry as afflu|ence and innocence could make them. How|ever, as they were now preparing for a very &s;olemn ceremony, their laughter entirely di&s;|plea&s;ed me. I told them of the grave, becom|ing and &s;ublime deportment they &s;hould a&s;|&s;ume upon this my&s;tical occa&s;ion, and read them two homilies and a the&s;is of my own
<PB N="219" REF="211">
compo&s;ing, in order to prepare them. Yet they &s;till &s;eemed perfectly refractory and ungovernable. Even as we were going along to church, to which I led the way, all gra|vity had quite for&s;aken them, and I was of|ten tempted to turn back in indignation. In church a new dilemma aro&s;e, which pro|mi&s;ed no ea&s;y &s;olution. This was, which couple &s;hould be married fir&s;t; my &s;on's bride warmly in&s;i&s;ted, that Lady Thornhill, (that was to be) &s;hould take the lead; but this the other refu&s;ed with equal ardour, prote&s;ting &s;he would not be guilty of &s;uch rudene&s;s for the world. The argument was &s;upported for &s;ome time between both with equal ob&s;tinacy and good breeding. But as I &s;tood all this time with my book ready, I was at la&s;t quite tired of the conte&s;t, and &s;hutting it, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I perceive,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that none of you have a mind to be married, and I think we had as good go back again; for I &s;uppo&s;e
<PB N="220" REF="212">
there will be no bu&s;ine&s;s done here to|day."</Q>&mdash;This at once reduced them to rea&s;on. The Baronet and his Lady were fir&s;t married, and then my &s;on and his lovely partner.</P>
<P>I had previou&s;ly that morning given orders that a coach &s;hould be &s;ent for my hone&s;t neighbour Flamborough and his family, by which means, upon our return to the inn, we had the plea&s;ure of finding the two Mi&s;s Flamboroughs alighted before us. Mr. Jenkin&s;on gave his hand to the elde&s;t, and my &s;on Mo|&s;es led up the other; (and I have &s;ince found that he has taken a real liking to the girl, and my con&s;ent and bounty he &s;hall have whenever he thinks proper to demand them.) We were no &s;ooner re|turned to the inn, but numbers of my pa|ri&s;hioners, hearing of my &s;ucce&s;s, came to congratulate me, but among the re&s;t were tho&s;e who ro&s;e to re&s;cue me, and whom
<PB N="221" REF="213">
I formerly rebuked with &s;uch &s;harpne&s;s. I told the &s;tory to Sir William, my &s;on-in-law, who went out and reproved them with great &s;everity; but finding them quite di&s;|heartened by his har&s;h reproof, he gave them half a guinea a piece to drink his health and rai&s;e their dejected &s;pirits.</P>
<P>Soon after this we were called to a very genteel entertainment, which was dre&s;t by Mr. Thornhill's cook. And it may not be improper to ob&s;erve with re&s;pect to that gentleman, that he now re&s;ides in quality of companion at a relation's hou&s;e, being very well liked and &s;eldom &s;itting at the &s;ide-table, except when there is no room at the other; for they make no &s;tranger of him. His time is pretty much taken up in keep|ing his relation, who is a little melancholy, in &s;pirits, and in learning to blow the French-horn. My elde&s;t daughter, however, &s;till remembers him with regret; and &s;he has
<PB N="222" REF="214">
even told me, though I make a great &s;ecret of it, that when he reforms &s;he may be brought to relent. But to return, for I am not apt to digre&s;s thus, when we were to &s;it down to dinner our ceremonies were going to be renewed. The que&s;tion was whether my elde&s;t daughter, as being a matron, &s;hould not &s;it above the two young brides, but the debate was cut &s;hort by my &s;on George, who propo&s;ed, that the company &s;hould &s;it indi&s;criminately, every gentleman by his lady, This was re|ceived with great approbation by all, ex|cepting my wife, who I could perceive was not perfectly &s;atisfied, as &s;he expected to have had the plea&s;ure of &s;itting at the head of the table and carving all the meat for all the company. But notwith&s;tanding this, it is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe our good hu|mour. I can't &s;ay whether we had more wit among&s;t us now than u&s;ual; but I am certain we had more laughing, which an|&s;wered the end as well. One je&s;t I parti|cularly
<PB N="223" REF="215">
remember, old Mr. Wilmot drink|ing to Mo&s;es, who&s;e head was turned ano|ther way, my &s;on replied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Madam, I thank you."</Q> Upon which the old gen|tleman, winking upon the re&s;t of the com|pany, ob&s;erved that he was thinking of his mi&s;tre&s;s. At which je&s;t I thought the two mi&s;s Flamboroughs would have died with laughing. As &s;oon as dinner was over, according to my old cu&s;tom, I re|que&s;ted that the table might be taken away, to have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing all my fa|mily a&s;&s;embled once more by a chearful fire-&s;ide. My two little ones &s;at upon each knee, the re&s;t of the company by their partners. I had nothing now on this &s;ide of the grave to wi&s;h for, all my cares were over, my plea&s;ure was un&s;peak|able. It now only remained that my grati|tude in good fortune &s;hould exceed my for|mer &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion in adver&s;ity.</P>
