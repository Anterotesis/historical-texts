<HEAD>AN AUTHENTIC NARRATIVE OF THE PROCEEDINGS AT <HI>CAMBRIDGE.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Cam. <DATE><HI>Dec.</HI> 16, 1750.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>_AS the Subject of the following Sheets has been Matter of pub|lic Di&s;cour&s;e, and the Circum|&s;tances attending it much mi&s;|taken by &s;ome, and gro&s;ly mi&s;|repre&s;ented by others, it is thought proper to lay before the World a plain and &s;uccinct <HI>Narrative</HI> of the whole Proceed|ings; and we can a&s;&s;ure our Readers that no material Circum&s;tance is omitted.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
<HI>Saturday Nov.</HI> 17th, being the Anniver&s;ary of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> Forty-&s;ix Gentlemen of this Univer&s;ity, who had been educated at <HI>W&mdash;r</HI> School, met together at the <HI>Tuns</HI> Tavern to commemorate their Foundre&s;s, as was cu&s;tomary on that Day. Among&s;t them were &s;everal <HI>Fellow-Commoners</HI> and <HI>Fellows of Colleges,</HI> and <HI>three Ma&s;ters of Arts;</HI> one of whom, Mr. <HI>F&mdash;n, G&mdash;k P&mdash;&s;&s;&mdash;r</HI> of the Univer&s;ity, was Pre&s;ident. The Compa|ny met between Eight and Nine o'Clock. Every Thing was conducted with the utmo&s;t Decency and Sobriety, and they were breaking up at Eleven; when, to the great Surprize of all the Gentlemen pre&s;ent, Mr. <HI>B&mdash;n,</HI> Se|nior P&mdash;r of the Univer&s;ity, enter'd the Room, attended by Mr. <HI>F&mdash;r,</HI> who fol|low'd him with the Staff. What en&s;ued, the Reader will find amply di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the Cour&s;e of the&s;e Proceedings; and we &s;hall only ob|&s;erve that, after about twenty Minutes Stay in the Room, the Company &s;eparated and retired to their re&s;pective Colleges.</P>
<P>On the <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> following it was reported, that there had been a Meeting of the <HI>Heads</HI> on the Occa&s;ion, and that the <HI>V. C.</HI> had laid be|fore them Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;'s Accu&s;ation again&s;t the whole Club; and al&s;o particular Charges a|gain&s;t <HI>three Ma&s;ters of Arts</HI> and <HI>two Fellow Commoners;</HI> and that, in con&s;equence of this Meeting, it had been determined to &s;ummons them to the <HI>V. C.</HI>'s Court on <HI>Saturday.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4">
It was with much Difficulty, that the Gen|tlemen concern'd could per&s;uade them&s;elves to give any Credit to &s;o &s;trange a Report; as it was ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e a Matter &s;o trifling and in&s;ignificant could &s;o far merit the Attention of the <HI>V. C.</HI> and <HI>H&mdash;ds,</HI> and much le&s;s engage them in &s;uch violent Proceedings. This Re|port however being confirm'd, Mr. <HI>C</HI>&mdash;, Mr. <HI>A</HI>&mdash;, and Mr. <HI>F&mdash;n,</HI> judged it highly expedient to wait on the <HI>V. C.</HI> in order to enquire into the Particulars, and at the &s;ame Time that they might have the Op|portunity of ju&s;tifying their Conduct to him; which they accordingly did, on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> Af|ternoon, when they acquainted him with the Report that had prevailed, and the Surprize with which they had heard it. He a&s;&s;ured them it was true, that there had been a Meet|ing; and that they mu&s;t appear at his Court on <HI>Saturday.</HI> They then repre&s;ented to him, in as mode&s;t Terms as they could make U&s;e of, that it gave them great Concern to find he had &s;o far countenanced an Accu&s;ation, not only again&s;t Under-Graduates, but again&s;t Per&s;ons of Standing and Character in the Univer&s;ity, as to lay it before the <HI>H&mdash;ds;</HI> and that they could not but be of Opinion, it had been more candid and humane, before he proceeded &s;o far, to have heard what they had to &s;ay in De|fence of their Conduct; and did a&s;&s;ure him at the &s;ame Time, that, if the Affair was brought before the Court, if not &s;upported, it would
<PB N="6" REF="5">
appear as a malicious ill-grounded Pro&s;ecution, and could therefore be attended with no other Con&s;equences than to throw an Odium on the Accu&s;er, promote Animo&s;ities and Divi&s;ions in the Univer&s;ity, and only le&s;&s;en that Authority which it was meant to &s;upport. They de&s;ired the <HI>V. C.</HI> even then, as it was certainly in his Power, to make up the Matter amicably. The <HI>V. C.</HI> reply'd, that he had acted as his Duty required; that he had received the Ac|cu&s;ation in Form from the P&mdash;r, and had laid it before the <HI>H&mdash;ds;</HI> that he could not de|termine it any other Way than by hearing their public Defence in Court, which they were at Liberty to make; that they were &s;ummoned to appear on <HI>Saturday,</HI> and Citations were al|ready given out for that Purpo&s;e. Upon which the Gentlemen took their Leave, and next Morning received (as did al&s;o Mr. <HI>V&mdash;e</HI> and Mr. <HI>V&mdash;n)</HI> their &s;eperate Citations in Form as follows:</P>

<P>All the Gentlemen, who were at the Club, were al&s;o ordered to appear in Court.</P>
<P>Nothing was now talked of in the Univer|&s;ity but the <HI>W&mdash;r</HI> Club, the Meeting of the H&mdash;ds, the Summons, and above all the Citation of <HI>M&mdash;rs</HI> of <HI>A&mdash;ts</HI> into the <HI>V.

<P>That he told Mr. <HI>C&mdash;w,</HI> that it did not ap|pear they had done &s;o; for it was now pa&s;t the Time that tho&s;e young Gentlemen ought to have been at home.</P>
<P>That Mr. <HI>C&mdash;w</HI> received particular Ap|plau&s;e from the Company for what he had &s;aid, and appeared to be much delighted with it.</P>

<P>That Mr. P&mdash;&s;&s;&mdash;r talked &s;ome Time, and expre&s;&s;ed a great deal of Anger and Re&s;ent|ment upon being interrupted by the P&mdash;r that Night.</P>
<P>That &s;oon after he called out, <Q REND="inline">"Here's to our next merry Meeting;"</Q> which Words were twice at lea&s;t repeated. He added once&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"without Interruption from P&mdash;rs."</Q></P>
<P>The P&mdash;r al&s;o alleged, that, during the&s;e Tran&s;actions, he did ob&s;erve a Gentleman in particular behave very rudely: That he <HI>heard</HI> next Morning Mr. <HI>V&mdash;e</HI> had behaved very ill, and that he &s;ent for him, to &s;ee if he were that Gentleman; and upon &s;eeing and talking with him, it appeared he was not.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Mr.</HI> V. C.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN a very public and unprecedented Man|ner I appear before you, accu&s;ed of Irre|gularity and In&s;ult to the P&mdash;r in the Execu|tion of his Office.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13">
It is indeed a very general Accu&s;ation; and as it is of a criminal Nature, it ought, accord|ing to the e&s;tabli&s;hed and univer&s;al Practice of all Courts of Ju&s;tice, to be mo&s;t literally and demon&s;trably proved. A few Facts have been mention'd to &s;upport the Charge; of which &s;ome have been particularly alleged again&s;t my&s;elf. In the Cour&s;e of my Defence there|fore I &s;hall endeavour to obviate the Facts: Notwith&s;tanding it is my &s;incere Opinion I could evince to the Audience, that even if they were true, yet neverthele&s;s that they could by no means (if candidly interpreted according to the concomitant Circum&s;tances and Occa&s;ion) be ju&s;tly &s;aid to amount to an In&s;ult on Autho|rity. But as your Judgment, I hope, will be impartially formed upon the Truth of Evidence, and a due Regard to the Merits of our Cau&s;e; I cannot but greatly rejoice, that &s;o many of the <HI>W&mdash;r</HI> Scholars were then pre&s;ent to atte&s;t what I &s;hall a&s;&s;ert; and that &s;o many Members of the U&mdash;y are now pre&s;ent to bear Wit|ne&s;s of our Vindication.</P>
<P>To dige&s;t as well as I can and methodize my Defence, I &s;hall &s;ubmit it to your Con&s;idera|tion in the following Order.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I &s;hall &s;tate to you very faithfully, according to the be&s;t of my Memory, the Be|haviour both of the P&mdash;r and the Club upon our Commemoration-Night; for upon this the whole of the Accu&s;ation is founded.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14">
<HI>Secondly,</HI> I &s;hall enlarge upon the Circum|&s;tances; and expre&s;&s;ly account for my own Conduct upon that Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> I &s;hall entreat your Indul|gence, that I may mention to this Audience the Proceedings &s;ub&s;equent to, and con&s;equent of, the P&mdash;r's Vi&s;it.</P>
<P>It has been a con&s;tant Cu&s;tom among the Scholars educated at <HI>W&mdash;r</HI> to celebrate the 17th of <HI>November,</HI> as the Anniver&s;ary of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who was Foundre&s;s of their School; for which Rea&s;on la&s;t <HI>Saturday</HI> Night a numerous Meeting of 46 were a&s;&s;embled. There is no Nece&s;&s;ity for me to take Notice of any Thing which pa&s;&s;ed before the P&mdash;r's Vi&s;it; except only, that before his coming, we had called for our Bill, had collected our Reckoning, and &s;hould have departed before his Entrance, if there had not been an acci|dental Omi&s;&s;ion in the Bill, and a Mi&s;compu|tation of what &s;hould be given to the Waiters and Servants; and that it was on account of this Deficiency we were retarded 'till the Waiter could collect Sixpence a-piece more from the Members. He was ordered to do it with Di&s;patch; in the mean Time we were de&s;ired by the Pre&s;ident to drink a concluding Toa&s;t to Dr. <HI>N&mdash;ls</HI>'s Health.</P>
<P>It was at this Cri&s;is that the P&mdash;r came in, without Notice, and with &s;o little Ceremony that I knew not of his Pre&s;ence, 'till I &s;aw him

near me at the upper end of the Room. He came very abruptly to the Head of the Table, and told us, it was an irregular Hour, and or|dered us to depart: Upon this a Silence en&s;ued, and there &s;eem'd to be a general Amazement. It was then, Mr. <HI>V. C,</HI> I addre&s;s'd my&s;elf to him, to inform him of the Occa&s;ion of our Meeting, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That it was to commemorate the Founda|tion-day of our School; and I ob&s;erved to him that we were ju&s;t going to depart: If he would con&s;ider therefore the Occa&s;ion and the Hour, he would not charge us with Irregularity: And I further told him, that &s;ince he had taken the unu&s;ual Pains to vi|&s;it us, I reque&s;ted him to do us the Ju&s;tice to remark the Sobriety and good Order of our Members, and to report it accordingly to their Reputation."</Q> The&s;e were, as near as I can now recollect, my very Words. The Members applauded me by clapping of their Hands. The P&mdash;r thereupon &s;aid, he thought that was In&s;ult to him. Upon which I reply'd, I am per&s;uaded, Sir, that you mi&s;interpret the Applau&s;e of the Company; for it is meant, I believe, to &s;ignify their Approbation of what I &s;aid in Vindication of the Occa&s;ion of our Meeting and of the Regularity of it: And I a&s;&s;ured him, I did not mean by what I had &s;aid to encourage Di&s;obedience to his Authority. He &s;eem'd &s;atisfied with my An&s;wer, and told me, he was not offended with it. Mr. P&mdash;&s;&s;&mdash;r <HI>F&mdash;n</HI> next &s;poke to him, and told him, that
<PB N="17" REF="16">
our Reckoning was ju&s;t collected, Bill ready for Payment on the Table, and that we were going to drink to Dr. <HI>N&mdash;ls</HI>'s Health before we departed: He remon&s;trated too again&s;t the Incivility of vi&s;iting him without Notice, as he was <HI>A. M.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>C&mdash;w</HI> next &s;poke upon the Point of not paying a cu&s;tomary Regard to their Degree. At the End of each of their Speeches there en|&s;ued a general Applau&s;e. It was then propo&s;ed to drink the Toa&s;t and go: Mr. <HI>F&mdash;n,</HI> Mr. <HI>C&mdash;w</HI> and my&s;elf advi&s;ing them to obey, the Company &s;hew'd a very ready Obedience to the Advice. We immediately left the Room, and withdrew to our re&s;pective Colleges. Nor do I yet hear of any per&s;onal Affront or Injury which was then offered to the P&mdash;r.</P>
<P>Having thus as briefly as po&s;&s;ible informed you of the Facts, I &s;hall <HI>Secondly</HI> enlarge upon the Circum&s;tances which will explain tho&s;e Facts: And by more thoroughly acquainting you with the Motives, &s;hall enable you to judge more equitably upon their Merits.</P>
<P>The Motives to commemorate a Founder's Day are indi&s;putably grounded upon a generous and laudable Principle of Gratitude; and are authorized by many &s;uch &s;olemn Fe&s;tivals ob|&s;erved in every College, and in all Societies where Piety to Patrons is pre&s;erved. The U&s;es and Advantages of School-Anniver&s;aries are certainly commendable, as they tend to culti|vate
<PB N="18" REF="17">
and improve tho&s;e mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted Friend&s;hips contracted in our Youth. And if I am not deceived (I &s;peak this with great De|ference to your Office) even you, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> have formerly expre&s;&s;ed your Sen&s;e and Ap|probation of the&s;e greatful Commemorations, by your Pre&s;ence at the Anniver&s;aries of the Charterhou&s;e School. This I mention with great Deference to you, Sir; but as it &s;eems to be much in Point, Self-defence obliges me to take Notice of it.</P>
<P>It being confe&s;&s;ed therefore that our Meet|ing was originally at lea&s;t not culpable, it fol|lows then, that &s;ome After-Act mu&s;t be proved to make it &s;o. But no &s;uch After-Act does appear upon Evidence: For what has been pretended (if culpable) has been very weakly objected, and not at all &s;upported by the Com|plainant. Was there any Intemperance? Was there any per&s;onal Injury or Affront offer'd to Mr. <HI>B&mdash;n?</HI> None is &s;ugge&s;ted: He only &s;ays in general, that as P&mdash;r he was in&s;ulted. Had it the Appearance of an irregular Meeting, where a P-f-r was Pre&s;ident, and &s;o many Fellows of Colleges were his A&s;&s;ociates? Can it &s;o properly be &s;aid to be a Club as a &s;olemn An|niver&s;ary, which is allow'd even to our younger Brethren at the School? Can any Irregularity be ju&s;tly imputed to us? I am con&s;cious there will be none. I am con&s;cious, you will be convinced, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> that none can be impu|ted, when you have given me leave to explain
<PB N="19" REF="18">
at large the only Fact which &s;eems to affect us, <Q REND="inline">"That we had not left the Room at Eleven;"</Q> altho' it is mo&s;t certainly true, that we were about to depart when the P&mdash;r came in. Let it b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> remember'd, that our Bill and Reckoning were ready on the Table, &s;o much in readi|ne&s;s to be paid; that it was only delayed while the Deficiency of the Mi&s;calculation and fir&s;t Collection was to be made good by a &s;mall Ad|dition, and while the concluding Health of Dr. <HI>N&mdash;ls</HI> our Ma&s;ter was to be drank. Be it known to you, that &s;ome of the Members were ju&s;t gone, many were then going; and I think it is more than probable, that the whole Com|pany, at lea&s;t the Under-Graduates, would at that Time have been retired to their proper Colleges, if it had not been incumbent upon the Seniors at the Table to de&s;ire them, with as much Di&s;patch as po&s;&s;ible, to make good the Defect of the Reckoning by contributing &s;ome|thing more. At this in&s;tant, without any No|tice given, without &s;o much as a Me&s;&s;age to Mr <HI>F&mdash;n,</HI> Ma&s;ter of Arts, P-f-r and our Pre|&s;ident, the P&mdash;r entred. But &s;o fal&s;e is his Depo&s;ition of a general Shout and Confu&s;ion, that I mo&s;t &s;olemnly declare, I did not know he was in the Room, 'till I &s;aw him near me at the upper End of the Table. Neither can I recollect any Confu&s;ion &s;o remarkable at that Time as his own; which I take Notice of here, becau&s;e I think it in &s;ome degree mate|rial, as it mu&s;t invalidate the Credit of his Re|port;
<PB N="20" REF="19">
and as it may in &s;ome mea&s;ure account for the Incon&s;i&s;tency of his Accu&s;ation again&s;t us. So in&s;en&s;ible and ignorant was I of his Pre&s;ence, that when I &s;aw the whole Company ri&s;e up from their Chairs, I thought it was ei|ther to drink the Toa&s;t (for this Ceremony is ob&s;erved among us in public Healths) or to de|part.</P>
<P>So fal&s;e is the Charge of a general Outcry or Hallooing before he &s;poke, or afterwards, that I &s;olemnly declare an univer&s;al Silence en|&s;ued upon his Speech: And that the Silence and the Con&s;ternation, which prevailed over the whole Company, excited me to vindicate and exempt them from his A&s;per&s;ion of Irre|gularity.</P>
<P>When you reflect, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> upon this Si|tuation of the Members, and the manife&s;t Su&s;pence they were in, you will not be offended that I &s;hould inform the P&mdash;r of the extraor|dinary Occa&s;ion of our Meeting, and that we were about to depart; or that I &s;hould de&s;ire him to ob&s;erve, to the Reputation of the Club, it's &s;ingular Sobriety and Decency. It mu&s;t be a mo&s;t rigid Interpretation of my Words to extort an Expre&s;&s;ion of In&s;olence from them; and it is a very unju&s;t In&s;inuation, that they were &s;poke with Deri&s;ion. The P&mdash;r did not &s;o under&s;tand them, for, when I afterwards attempted to &s;atisfy him of the Rea&s;on of the Applau&s;e which followed them, he confe&s;&s;ed to me, he was not offended with what I had
<PB N="21" REF="20">
&s;aid. A &s;trange Confe&s;&s;ion, if it had been true, that I had &s;poke to him with an Air of Triumph!</P>
<P>When I had thus, with much Submi&s;&s;ion, (and am con&s;cious without a Sneer) made this Repre&s;entation to him, an Applau&s;e en&s;ued; which he mi&s;conceived to be an intended In|&s;olence to him, as P&mdash;r. I again therefore addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to him, to a&s;&s;ure him, that he mi&s;interpreted the Meaning of it, and that he &s;hould find a ready Obedience to his Au|thority.</P>
<P>Yet before I conclude this Part of my De|fence, I &s;hall more directly obviate the P&mdash;r's Objection, That I &s;poke to him with a Sneer and an Air of Triumph. The&s;e Words &s;eem to be an Embelli&s;hment, and rhetorically thrown in to inflame and to &s;upport an Accu|&s;ation which wanted &s;uch A&s;&s;i&s;tance: But I an&s;wer plainly, That I was not guilty of &s;uch irreverent Behaviour; and I think the P&mdash;r him&s;elf, on a better Recollection, acquits me of it; for he now confe&s;&s;es in Court, that he then told me, <Q REND="inline">"He was not offended with what I had &s;aid to him."</Q> How repugnant to each other are the Charge and the Confe&s;&s;ion! Moreover, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> I cannot but now think, I might &s;afely have &s;ubmitted my own Con|duct to your Judgment, even upon the very Words of the Accu&s;ation, if the P&mdash;r had not invented that &s;upplemental Improvement upon the Manner in which I uttered them. But as
<PB N="22" REF="21">
this Aggravation is in&s;i&s;ted on, I po&s;itively deny the Truth of it; and his After-Confe&s;&s;ion will give Credit to my Negation.</P>
<P>If this will not &s;atisfy you, Sir, it mu&s;t re&s;t on our Credibility and Characters, or the Te&s;timony of the Company. Yet I &s;hall add an Ob&s;ervation, which may induce you to be|lieve me: It is, That if you con&s;ider the Words laid to my Charge, you will not find them to be indecent, or &s;currilous, or of that Nature that would require me to make u&s;e of a Sneer, or an Air of Triumph. [<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The P&mdash;r too has told you, that I did not appear to be plea&s;ed with the Applau&s;es as Mr. <HI>C&mdash;w</HI> &s;eem|ed to be:"</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Crotchet was not &s;poke in Court, but delivered in to the <HI>V. C.</HI> afterwards.</NOTE>Does not this Acknowlege|ment imply a Contradiction to the Air of Tri|umph? Remember therefore Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> that, as this Accu&s;ation is of the Nature of a Crimi|nal Profecution it ought to be qua&s;h'd and an|nulled, if it be either uncertain, or too gene|ral; more e&s;pecially, if the chief Matter in Charge is not fully verified.</P>
<P>Thus far relates to my&s;elf; and I have the Confidence now to expect, that my Conduct on the Occa&s;ion will appear rather commend|able than culpable; for the P&mdash;r cannot but do me the Ju&s;tice to confe&s;s, that I recommended an Obedience to him.</P>
<P>Next as an Evidence &tristar;&dtristar;&tristar;&dtristar;&tristar; [<HI>Here I was interrupted from giving my Atte&s;|tation
<PB N="23" REF="22">
to the Behaviour of my A&s;&s;ociates: But the <HI>V. C.</HI> indulged me to relate the following Fact, as a Proof of the Re&s;pect always paid by the P&mdash;rs to A. M. &s;o far as not to vi&s;it, where they are in Company.</HI>]</P>
<P>It is incumbent upon me to take Notice of the Remon&s;trance made by Mr. <HI>F&mdash;n</HI> again&s;t the P&mdash;r's Incivility of not regarding him, as Gentlemen of his Degree had ever been re|&s;pected by the Magi&s;trates of the U&mdash;y. And what e&s;pecially induces me (tho' not ho|noured with the &s;ame Degree) to &s;peak upon this Subject, is, that I can quote an In&s;tance to confirm this cu&s;tomary Deference, from a Vi&s;it at the <HI>Tuns</HI> where I was pre&s;ent. It was in the Moderator&s;hip of Mr. <HI>R&mdash;&s;s;</HI> who one Night, in the Execution of his Office, came into the Room, where a Ma&s;ter of Arts of <HI>K&mdash;g</HI>'s-<HI>College</HI> and my&s;elf were at Supper. But Mr. <HI>R&mdash;&s;s</HI> (altho' a noted Di&s;ciplinarian) was &s;o &s;en|&s;ible of the Incivility which he had committed, that on the next Day he made an Apology to me, and a&s;&s;ured me, that his coming into the Room where a Ma&s;ter of Arts was in Compa|ny, had been occa&s;ioned by the Waiter's Neg|lect of informing him who were there.</P>
<P>Give me leave now, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> to mention in few Words the Procedings &s;ub&s;equent to, and con&s;equent of, the P&mdash;r's Vi&s;it.</P>
<P>Common Report had informed me, that &s;ome of the Under-Graduates had been &s;ent for by
<PB N="24" REF="23">
the P&mdash;r: I heard afterwards, that he had &s;ent for and demanded a Li&s;t of Names: And it was told me, that you, Sir, had con&s;ulted the <HI>H&mdash;ds</HI> upon this Subject of the Vi&s;it to the <HI>W&mdash;rs.</HI> Yet 'till I waited upon you at your Lodge on <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> I did not know that any Infor|mation had been offered again&s;t Mr. <HI>F&mdash;n,</HI> Mr. <HI>C&mdash;w,</HI> or my&s;elf; neither did I know, that my Reputation had been called in Que&s;tion before an A&s;&s;embly of the <HI>H&mdash;ds.</HI> When therefore you acquainted me with the Informa|tion, Con&s;ultation, and Citation for me to appear in Court before you, I could not but be greatly a&s;toni&s;hed at the &s;eeming Impropriety of your receiving an Accu&s;ation, reporting it again to others, and countenancing the Charge &s;o much as to &s;ummon us to an&s;wer in Court, before you had in the lea&s;t enquired what might be &s;hewn as Cau&s;e, why the Information &s;hould not be granted at all.</P>
<P>This Proceeding, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> however it may be authorized by the Power of your Office, was neverthele&s;s contrary to a fundamental Rule of the Civil Law, which ought, I believe, in a great Mea&s;ure, to direct this Court. The Rule is,
<Q><L>Non debet Actore licere, quod Reo non per|mittitur. <BIBL>Dig. lib. 50. Tit. 17. l. 41.</BIBL></L></Q>
It is a Rule of Equity and Rea&s;on, and &s;hould e&s;pecially be admitted here, where the Power of the Judge &s;eems to be &s;o unlimited. You told us in An&s;wer, That you was obliged to
<PB N="25" REF="24">
receive the Information; and that for your own A&s;&s;i&s;tance, you had con&s;ulted the <HI>H&mdash;ds.</HI> I do not que&s;tion this; I only contend, that it would have been more candid and humane, if you had allowed us a Hearing before your Re|port to the <HI>H&mdash;ds.</HI> For how faithfully &s;oever you might repeat the <HI>P&mdash;r</HI>'s Accu&s;ation; yet certainly you was liable to a wrong Impre&s;|&s;ion for want of regarding the well known and ju&s;t Maxim, <HI>Audi alteram partem.</HI> Much more were the <HI>H&mdash;ds</HI> liable to receive a wrong Impre&s;&s;ion of the Merits of our Cau&s;e, from it's being received by a <HI>V. C.</HI> and &s;o far coun|tenanced as to be thought worthy of a Con&s;ul|tation upon it.</P>
<P>You told us indeed, Sir, that this &s;hould in no wi&s;e prejudice our Cau&s;e. I mu&s;t beg Leave to reply, that it has already been very prejudi|cial to us: And altho' I have the Confidence to hope that none of our Judges will &s;uffer &s;uch an Impre&s;&s;ion to mi&s;lead them into a Praejudi|cation of the Ca&s;e before them; yet the Cita|tion it&s;elf is a Puni&s;hment much too &s;evere for the Offence, (if in Truth any Offence could be made to appear.) Strangers to the Facts will conclude, from the very Nature of &s;uch an ex|traordinary Citation, that it implies &s;ome Guilt: And it certainly &s;ubjects us, 'till the Hour of Trial, to the Reflections of the U&mdash;y, before they are enabled to judge truly on the Facts and Merits. It is well known to this Audience, Facts of this kind gather Fal&s;ehood in Report;
<PB N="26" REF="25">
and that Fame, e&s;pecially an ill-natured Fame, encrea&s;es as &s;he flies. Many of the&s;e fal&s;e Rumours have come to my own Hearing; and &s;everal of them relative to my&s;elf; nay, the Accu&s;ation it&s;elf is a fal&s;e Imputation: For which Cau&s;e I am glad of this Opportunity to contradict them before &s;o full an A&s;&s;embly of the whole U&mdash;y. Neverthele&s;s, as this Ci|tation has hitherto given &s;ome Countenance to &s;uch Reports, I cannot but think it a Hard&s;hip, that I was not indulged with a Hearing before Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> had &s;o far given a kind of Sanction to the Calumny.</P>
<P>But if I e&s;teem this as an Hard&s;hip upon my|&s;elf, there is much more Rea&s;on to con&s;ider it as an Inju&s;tice to Mr. <HI>F&mdash;n,</HI> a Gentleman of an un|blemi&s;hed Reputation, a Ma&s;ter of Arts, Fel|low of a College, and of di&s;tingui&s;hed Honour in the U&mdash;y: Yet not the common Civi|lities due to his Degree have been &s;hown him by the P&mdash;r; (and this is undoubtedly an Affront to the whole Body of <HI>A. M.)</HI> no Re&s;|pect has been paid him as a P&mdash;f&mdash;r; nor the common Practice ob&s;erved of hearing him be|fore the Report, or &s;o much as Notice given to him or any of us, of the Proceedings again&s;t us. For I am well a&s;&s;ured, that, 'till I ac|company'd them to the <HI>V. C.</HI>'s on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI>-noon, neither the P&mdash;f&mdash;r, nor Mr. <HI>C&mdash;w</HI> had been &s;poke to upon this Subject by any of the Magi&s;trates, notwith&s;tanding natural Equity &s;eemed to require that we &s;hould have been
<PB N="27" REF="26">
invited to an&s;wer Mr. <HI>B&mdash;n</HI>'s Objections, or apprized of them at lea&s;t before they were re|ferred to a Con&s;ultation of the H&mdash;ds. The&s;e are known Rules in Courts of Equity and Civil Law.</P>
<P><Q><L>Favorabiliores Rei potius quam Actores habentur.</L>
<BIBL>Dig. l. 50. Reg. 125.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><L>In paenalibus cau&s;is benignius interpretandum e&s;t.</L>
<BIBL>Reg. 155.</BIBL></Q>
And certainly, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> if ever it was rea&s;ona|ble to regard this Doctine <HI>Favores ampliandi, Odia vero re&s;tinguenda &s;unt,</HI> it now &s;eems mo&s;t remarkably &s;o, when the notorious Divi&s;ions among our&s;elves already furni&s;h our Enemies with &s;o much Cau&s;e of Triumph again&s;t us. But to receive in &s;uch Manner an ill-founded Accu&s;ation again&s;t the Members of &s;o great a School as <HI>W&mdash;r,</HI> does not &s;eem to be a probable Method of reconciling Di&s;&s;entions, or extingui&s;hing the Flames which already pre|vail too much. Excu&s;e me, Sir, for this Ob|&s;ervation; for the Nature of my Defence led me to it imperceptibly.</P>
<P>After all this &s;ingular and &s;evere Proceeding again&s;t us, does it appear that we have de&s;erv|ed any Severity or Cen&s;ure at all? Quite the Rever&s;e. And I am per&s;uaded, upon an un|prejudiced Enquiry into the Truth of the Ca&s;e, it will be evident, we have merited other U&s;age: Our Pre&s;ident e&s;pecially, in&s;tead of this crimi|nal
<PB N="28" REF="27">
Citation, has de&s;erved a better Treatment; and I cannot but think, that, in&s;tead of &s;uch a Cen&s;ure, the Thanks of the whole A&s;&s;embly are ju&s;tly due to him.</P>
<P>Gratitude and your Regard to Di&s;cipline &s;hould exact them from you, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> and the <HI>H&mdash;ds</HI> of Colleges, for pre&s;erving &s;o great a Sobriety and Temperance among forty young Gentlemen met to celebrate a Fe&s;tival, and revive their Friend&s;hips: For it mu&s;t be im|puted to his Preeminence, and a Deference to his Rank as well as his Example, that &s;o much Order, Decency, and Regularity were main|tained in &s;o numerous a Meeting. Thanks are due to him &tristar;&dtristar;&tristar;&dtristar;&tristar;&dtristar; [<HI>Here I was again interrupted, and de&s;ired to confine my&s;elf to the Defence of my own Conduct; in Obedience to which Injunction, I was obliged to proceed as follows, without a proper Connec|tion.</HI>]</P>
<P>Before my Conclu&s;ion I &s;hall recapitulate the Facts, and &s;ubjoin a &s;uccinct An&s;wer to the Charge again&s;t my&s;elf.</P>
<P>It is mo&s;t materially worthy your Con&s;idera|tion, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> to remember, that it &s;truck Eleven while the P&mdash;r was in the Yard, that when he came into the Room (which he did without any previous Notice) he found the Reckoning ju&s;t collected, and the Bill lying on the Table for immediate Payment; that we were drinking a concluding Toa&s;t to Dr. <HI>N&mdash;s</HI>'s Health; and that it was really owing
<PB N="29" REF="28">
to an accidental Mi&s;calculation, and to the Difficulty of collecting the Money from &s;o many Members that we were retarded &s;o long: And I may venture to a&s;&s;ure you, that I believe the whole Company would immediately have di&s;per&s;ed to their re&s;pective Colleges after drink|ing to the Doctor's Health, if they had not been &s;o <HI>un&s;ea&s;onably,</HI> I mu&s;t call it, <HI>vi&s;ited.</HI></P>
<P>In regard to my&s;elf, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> I do not find any Thing el&s;e alleged again&s;t me, but that I &s;poke to the P&mdash;r with a kind of Sneer, when he &s;o abruptly charged us with Irregularity, and ordered us to depart:&mdash;That expo&s;tulating with him, I &s;aid it was an An|nual and not a Monthly Meeting; and that I told him, with <HI>an Air of Triumph,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"Mr. P&mdash;r, I hope you do not think that what I &s;aid was with a De&s;ign of getting Applau&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>My fir&s;t Speech to him (as I have before repeated it) was intended only to wipe away the A&s;per&s;ion of Irregularity, and to vindicate the Reputation of the Company, by repre&s;ent|ing to him, with Deference to his Authority, the &s;olemn Occa&s;ion of our Meeting; and re|que&s;ting him to remark the general Sobriety of all that were pre&s;ent, and to report it ac|cordingly. My other Speech, for which I am here repon&s;ible, was intended to undeceive the P&mdash;r in his mi&s;conceived Opinion and Su&s;|picion, that the Applau&s;e was meant as an In|&s;olence to him; and I endeavoured to con|vince
<PB N="30" REF="29">
him, in very few Words, of his Mi&s;in|terpretation of it.</P>
<P>As to the Allegation, that I &s;poke with a <HI>Sneer</HI> or <HI>Air of Triumph,</HI> it &s;eems to be in|&s;erted only to induce you to believe he had &s;ome Foundation for an Accu&s;ation again&s;t me; for without that Addition, I am &s;ure there is none: But I po&s;itively an&s;wer to this Part of the Charge, that it is not true.</P>
<P>Upon the whole therefore, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> and <HI>H&mdash;ds,</HI> I hope this very faithful Explanation of my Conduct, and the Motives of it, will &s;uf|ficiently &s;atisfy you, that I never intended any In&s;ult again&s;t the P&mdash;r in the Execution of his Office; and I mo&s;t &s;olemnly declare to you, that I am not yet con&s;cious to my&s;elf of having committed any Offence again&s;t his Authority: But on the contrary, I am very con&s;cious, that my Behaviour has in no wi&s;e de&s;erved the&s;e Proceedings again&s;t me; for the whole Com|pany will bear me Witne&s;s, that I recom|mended it to them to obey the P&mdash;r and depart.</P>
<P>Upon this I &s;hall re&s;t my Defence, and &s;ub|mit it to your Judgment; reminding you of an equitable Maxim, that if there &s;hould be any Difference of Sentiments among you,
<Q><L>Inter di&s;pares Sententias, Mitior vincat.</L></Q></P>
<CLOSER><POSTSCRIPT>
<P><LABEL>P. S.</LABEL> When I had ended &s;peaking the above Defence; the P&mdash;r made a &s;evere Ob&s;ervation, That there was no Rea&s;on to

<P>Here it may not be ami&s;s to inform the Reader, that the latter Part of the P&mdash;r's Depo&s;ition was given in, and Mr. <HI>A&mdash;ll</HI>'s De|fence &s;poke, not in the <HI>Law-Schools,</HI> from whence the Court had adjourned on Account of it's growing dark, but in the <HI>Theatre,</HI> where the younger Part of the U&mdash;y took the Advantage (as might indeed ea&s;ily have been fore&s;een) of their Di&s;tance from the Court be|low, they being in the Galleries, to expre&s;s with Freedom their Sen&s;e of the Proceedings; and they accordingly took the Liberty to laugh at the Plaintiff, hi&s;s the Judge, and ap|plaud the Defendant; and that in &s;o tumul|tuous a Manner, that it was with the utmo&s;t
<PB N="32" REF="31">
Difficulty they were per&s;uaded to Silence and Attention. To prevent tho&s;e Di&s;orders from being repeated, Sixteen <HI>Pro-P&mdash;rs</HI> were appointed for the <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> following, with full Power to puni&s;h with the utmo&s;t Severity any who &s;hould di&s;turb the Proceedings.</P>
<P>Things being thus &s;ettled, the Court met again on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> at 9 in the Morning, when Mr. P&mdash;f&mdash;r <HI>F&mdash;n,</HI> before he entered on his Defence, de&s;ired the P&mdash;r might be &s;worn; but this he was informed by the <HI>V. C.</HI> and <HI>H&mdash;ds,</HI> was not the Cu&s;tom of that Court. It was &s;aid, that the P&mdash;r had taken an Oath on entering into his Office, which was &s;uffi|cient; but he might neverthele&s;s be upon Oath if he thought proper. Whereupon Mr. <HI>F&mdash;n</HI> a&s;ked him if he cho&s;e to be &s;worn, which he <HI>mode&s;tly</HI> refu&s;ed.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> and Gentlemen of the Court,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am &s;ummoned to appear before you in this Court to an&s;wer for in&s;ulting and in|terrupting the P&mdash;r in the Execution of his
<PB N="33" REF="32">
Office, on <HI>Saturday, November</HI> the 17th, at the <HI>W&mdash;r</HI> Club. Great Surprize I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s to you, I feel on this Occa&s;ion, and &s;till greater Anxiety; for little indeed did I expect, after &s;o many Years Standing, after &s;o long a Time pa&s;&s;ed with a Character blamele&s;s and irreproachable, after having ju&s;t received that Dignity from the U&mdash;ty, which (how un|worthy &s;oever I may be) I now &s;tand po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, little did I expect that, after all, I &s;hould be cited to appear in this public Manner, and called upon to an&s;wer for my Ill-behaviour. Very unworthy, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> &s;hould I account my|&s;elf of that Dignity, and very ungrateful to tho&s;e who conferred it upon me, were I capa|ble of doing that which is laid to my Charge, of flying in the Face of Authority, of in&s;ulting and interrupting a &s;uperior Magi&s;trate in the Execution of his Office.</P>
<P>That Ma&s;ters of Arts, Fellows of Colleges, Gentlemen of Character and Reputation in this Body, &s;hould be thus cited, is I believe, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> you will your&s;elf acknowlege, a Thing pretty unu&s;ual: I cannot therefore but
<PB N="34" REF="33">
be of Opinion, that in &s;uch a Ca&s;e the Facts alleged ought to be of a very extraordinary Na|ture, and the Proofs of them extreamly well &s;upported.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be more &s;ollicitous, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> in my Defence, and in Defence of tho&s;e Gentlemen who are accu&s;ed with me, becau&s;e I think the Honour of that School and Foundation from whence we came, the Honour of that Senate to which we belong, and of that U&mdash;y of which we are Members, are all of them mo&s;t nearly and intimately concerned in the Event. The Dignity, Weight, and Authority of a P&mdash;r ought undoubtedly to be &s;trenuou&s;ly &s;upported; but at the &s;ame Time I am &s;atisfied, that a due Deference and Regard is to be paid to tho&s;e of an inferior Rank. To put <HI>M. A.</HI> on the &s;ame Footing with Under-Graduates, to &s;ubject them to the &s;ame Re&s;traint in every Word and Action; this, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> is to level all Degrees, throw down all Di&s;tinction, and introduce Di&s;order and Confu&s;ion in the U&mdash;y.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>A&mdash;ll</HI> has already made his Defence, and a very excellent one it was, that has &s;uffi|ciently refuted every Thing laid to his Charge, and withal &s;tated the general Facts in a true Light, explained the Cau&s;e of our Meeting, and &s;hewn the great Order and Regularity with which every Thing was conducted.</P>
<P>Never indeed I believe did &s;o large and nu|merous an A&s;&s;embly meet, where more De|cency and Sobriety were maintained than at
<PB N="35" REF="34">
that where I had the Honour to pre&s;ide. To us, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> I will beg leave to ob&s;erve, this Decency and Sobriety might be in &s;ome Mea|&s;ure owing; and we therefore rather expected, from the Officers of the U&mdash;y, tho&s;e Thanks we endeavoured to merit, than that Cen&s;ure which we apparently meant to avoid.</P>
<P>It is but Ju&s;tice to the young Gentlemen concerned in this Accu&s;ation to acknowlege, that their Behaviour on this Occa&s;ion was wor|thy the Place of their Education, worthy of that School to which we have been indebted for &s;o many great and good Men, to which our noble and mo&s;t worthy <HI>Ch&mdash;lor</HI> did him|&s;elf belong, and which he has &s;o long patro|nized and protected; a School, in &s;hort, to which we owe &s;uch Men as always have been, now are, and I tru&s;t always will be, an Ho|nour and an Ornament to this U&mdash;y.</P>
<P>And yet, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> the&s;e are the Gentlemen who have created all this Di&s;turbance; by the&s;e the P&mdash;r was in&s;ulted and interrupted, and we are repre&s;ented as Abettors of an Action we were not capable of committing, as Encoura|gers of a De&s;ign to which we were ab&s;olute Strangers. How ill-&s;upported that Part of the Accu&s;ation is, which relates to Mr. <HI>A&mdash;ll,</HI> has already appeared; that what is alleged al&s;o again&s;t my&s;elf, &s;tands on no better Foundation, I &s;hall now endeavour, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> mo&s;t fully to convince you.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="35">
But before I enter upon this, there is one Thing which I mu&s;t beg Leave to take Notice of, and that is, that in a Cau&s;e of &s;o &s;erious and important a Nature (for &s;uch it is to us) again&s;t &s;o many Gentlemen of Honour and Reputation, the whole is &s;upported by the &s;in|gle Te&s;timony of a Per&s;on who has all along acknowleged him&s;elf to have been, during his whole Stay in the Club Room, in &s;uch Con|fu&s;ion and Perplexity as not to know what he &s;aid or did, as will indeed be &s;ufficiently evi|dent when you hear the Articles of his Depo|&s;ition; the inconceivable Fal&s;ehood and Ab&s;ur|dity of which I &s;hall be obliged to expo&s;e in Vindication of my own Conduct.</P>
<P>Omitting therefore tho&s;e Articles which re|gard particular Per&s;ons, I &s;hall con&s;ider only tho&s;e which have Re&s;pect to the general Beha|viour and remain unan&s;wered, and tho&s;e which concern my&s;elf. The&s;e I &s;hall lay before you, and confute in their Order di&s;tinctly and &s;eparately.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> for Mr. P&mdash;r's fir&s;t Article; Mr. P&mdash;r a&s;&s;erts, that <Q REND="inline">"upon go|ing into the Room the Gentlemen halloo'd, <HI>to the be&s;t of his Remembrance,</HI> before he &s;poke at all."</Q></P>
<P><HI>The Gentlemen halloo'd, he &s;ays, before he &s;poke at all, this is his fir&s;t</HI> A&mdash;Quale principium dedit! <HI>It has always been look'd up|on as an ill Omen to &s;tumble at the Thre&s;hold. The fir&s;t Thing he &s;ets out with is ab&s;olutely</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="36">
<HI>and directly fal&s;e; and to prove this, I beg that Mr.</HI> Wi&s;h, <HI>according to his own De&s;ire, may be brought into Court, and &s;worn,</HI> [which he accordingly was, and being a&s;ked whether, on his going up with the <HI>P&mdash;r,</HI> he remembered any Hal|looing at his Entrance, he &s;aid no, and that the fir&s;t Noi&s;e he heard, which was a Clapping, was about five Minutes afterwards, below Stairs. Mr. <HI>F&mdash;r</HI> al&s;o, a Gentleman who attended the <HI>P&mdash;r</HI> to carry his Staff, and was in the Room all the Time, was &s;worn, and &s;aid he remembered no &s;uch Noi&s;e till after Mr. <HI>A</HI>&mdash;had &s;poke.]</P>
<P>Here, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> is as ample Te&s;timony as can be produced again&s;t Mr. <HI>P&mdash;r</HI>'s Evidence; upon which I &s;hall beg Leave to make this Ob|&s;ervation.</P>
<P>That in all Courts of Judicature, (as I have been informed by Mr. <HI>A</HI>&mdash;, and &s;everal other Lawyers) where many Articles are alleged, if any one of tho&s;e Articles is fairly proved to be ab&s;olutely and inconte&s;tibly fal&s;e, the whole Pro&s;ecution drops to the Ground: But perhaps it may be &s;till better to prove every Article as fal&s;e as the fir&s;t, which may be done with the &s;ame Ea&s;e, for he goes on ju&s;t as he begins, <HI>Ab ovo u&s;que ad mala;</HI> for Example:</P>
<P>Article the <HI>Second</HI> &s;ays, That upon being in|formed there were Ma&s;ters of Arts in Compa|ny, <HI>he applied him&s;elf to Mr.</HI> F&mdash;n; and &s;aid he was come to de&s;ire, that all Per&s;ons, under the Degree of Ma&s;ter of Arts, in that Company
<PB N="38" REF="37">
would retire; adding, that it was pa&s;t Eleven o'Clock.</P>
<P>This Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> is ju&s;t as true as the former; for Mr. <HI>P&mdash;r</HI> made the Speech, he here men|tioned, without any Application to me. How|ever, it is matter of no Moment, whether he did or not; as I apprehend what he only &s;aid <HI>to</HI> me cannot po&s;&s;ibly be a Charge <HI>again&s;t</HI> me.</P>
<P>I proceed therefore to another Article, and a pretty remarkable one it is, that, <Q REND="inline">"about this Time, <HI>&s;ome</HI> of the Company began to ex|po&s;tulate; <HI>one</HI> in particular &s;aid, it was uncivil to vi&s;it that Night; <HI>&s;ome one</HI> &s;aid, it was a ri|gorous Execution of the Orders, or, <HI>Words to that Purpo&s;e."</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>This, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> is a mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing, unpre|cedented Way of laying an Allegation; &s;uch a vague and undeterminate Method, as not only proves but a&s;&s;erts Nothing, and would be &s;uffi|cient to qua&s;h any Charge in any Court what|ever. <HI>About this Time,</HI> Mr. <HI>P&mdash;r</HI> &s;ays, but about what Time we mu&s;t gue&s;s, <HI>&s;ome</HI> of the Company began to expo&s;tulate; but in regard to <HI>who</HI> they were, we are again left in the Dark; <HI>one</HI> in particular &s;aid it was uncivil; <HI>&s;ome one</HI> &s;aid it was a rigorous Execution! Is not this the &s;trange&s;t, mo&s;t perplexed Affair, a Story of I don't know what, &s;aid by I don't know who? But the Ab&s;urdity of it is &s;ufficiently evident, and it would be only Lo&s;s of Time to endea|vour <HI>to contradict</HI> what it is impo&s;&s;ible <HI>to un|der&s;tand.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="38">
The next Article therefore, which I &s;hall take Notice of, is this, that <Q REND="inline">"Mr. P&mdash;f&mdash;r <HI>F&mdash;n</HI> laughed when he (the P&mdash;r) attempted to &s;hew, that this was not a rigorous Execution of the Orders, and &s;aid, turning to &s;ome near him, This he calls a mild Execution of his Office;"</Q> and concludes with his u&s;ual Salvo, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>or Words to this Purpo&s;e.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Now, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> as to the fir&s;t Part of this Article: I &s;hall not conte&s;t a Smile with him, as it is very probable one might be rai&s;ed by Mr. <HI>P</HI>&mdash;'s boa&s;ting his great Indulgence: Every Under-Graduate is enjoined to leave Taverns at Eleven: Now it had ju&s;t &s;truck Eleven by &s;ome Clocks, by others it had not, when the P&mdash;r came. Had he come half an Hour after indeed he might have expected le&s;s Com|pany there; but, as it happened, he was but a Minute or two on the right Side of Autho|rity; and con&s;equently could have no great Merit to plead on that Hdea. But in regard to the latter Part of this Article, it is ab&s;olutely fal&s;e: I never did &s;ay, <HI>this he calls a mild Execu|tion of his Office.</HI> This perhaps might be &s;aid by &s;ome of the Company, but I &s;olemnly de|clare it was not &s;aid by me, nor any Words to that Purpo&s;e; and this I will te&s;tify on Oath if required, and I believe all the Gentlemen then pre&s;ent are ready to do the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Surely, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> to confound Per&s;onages, to put Speeches into one Man's Mouth which came out of another's, to fal&s;ify and equivo|cate
<PB N="40" REF="39">
in this Manner, to &s;ubject Gentlemen to all this Trouble and Unea&s;ine&s;s on &s;uch weak Foundations, is unju&s;t and ungenerous. You will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve he would exculpate him|&s;elf from ab&s;olute Fal&s;hood by the Salvos thrown into mo&s;t of the Articles, &s;uch as <HI>Words to this Purpo&s;e,</HI> and <HI>to the be&s;t of his Re|membrance.</HI> Whether what he a&s;&s;erts is to the be&s;t of his Remembrance or not, it is impo&s;&s;i|ble for me to determine; but I am certain if &s;o it be, his Memory is of a very peculiar and extraordinary Nature; for he has hitherto been &s;o unfortunate as to <HI>remember</HI> nothing, but that which was <HI>never</HI> &s;aid.</P>
<P>But to proceed. In the Depo&s;ition, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> you will find the following very curious Ar|ticle; that <Q REND="inline">"during the&s;e Di&s;putes, Mr. P&mdash;f&mdash;r &s;aid two or three Times, The P&mdash;r is do|ing his Duty; that he under&s;tood him to &s;ay &s;o with a <HI>Sneer</HI> the fir&s;t Time; that afterwards he thought that he did recollect him&s;elf, and &s;eem to be <HI>&s;erious;</HI> and la&s;tly, that he &s;hould have continued to have thought &s;o, if he had not &s;oon after turned into a <HI>Rage.</HI>"</Q> Here Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> is another In&s;tance of Mr. P&mdash;r's amaz|ing Exactne&s;s and Per&s;picuity in the Delivery of his Charge. Fir&s;t you &s;ee it was &s;aid with a <HI>Sneer,</HI> then it was &s;aid without a <HI>Sneer;</HI> and then it was &s;aid with a <HI>Sneer</HI> again. He &s;hould have thought I had been <HI>&s;erious,</HI> (he &s;ays) but that I turned into a <HI>Rage.</HI> Now for my Part, I cannot help thinking, but that
<PB N="41" REF="40">
mo&s;t People who are in a <HI>Rage</HI> are <HI>&s;erious;</HI> tho' it does indeed &s;ometimes happen, that Men are very <HI>&s;erious,</HI> and very <HI>angry</HI> too, on very trifling and in&s;ignificant Occa&s;ions, as is evident from the whole Cour&s;e of this Pro&s;ecu|tion. However, to cut &s;hort the Matter now in Di&s;pute, whether what I &s;aid was with a Sneer or without a Sneer, in a Pa&s;&s;ion or out of a Pa&s;&s;ion, I declare I never &s;aid it at all. It was what indeed by my Behaviour I expre&s;&s;ed, and that mo&s;t <HI>&s;eriou&s;ly</HI> all the Time; and the Gentlemen pre&s;ent will bear me Witne&s;s, that I de&s;ired them all &s;everal Times, as did al&s;o Mr. <HI>C&mdash;w</HI> and Mr. <HI>A&mdash;ll,</HI> not to in&s;ult or interrupt the P&mdash;r.</P>
<P>Mr. P&mdash;r goes on to a&s;&s;ert, that <Q REND="inline">"Mr. P&mdash;f&mdash;r talked &s;ome Time, and expre&s;&s;ed a great deal of <HI>Anger</HI> and <HI>Re&s;entment</HI> upon being interrupted by the P&mdash;r that Night."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. P&mdash;f&mdash;r, (he &s;ays) talk'd &s;ome Time:&mdash;One would really imagine, by the Number of the Things alleged, and the P&mdash;r's Manner of relating them, that he had &s;pent at lea&s;t two Hours in the Room; tho' the Truth is, he was there but twenty Minutes in the whole, and in that Space it is impo&s;&s;ible, half the Things, with the An&s;wers, Replies, &amp;c. which he talks of, could be &s;aid. But he goes on to a&s;&s;ert, that <HI>I expre&s;&s;ed a great deal of An|ger and Re&s;entment,</HI> and he had told you be|fore, that <HI>I was in a Rage.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="41">
Men in a <HI>Rage,</HI> Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> inflamed with <HI>Anger</HI> and <HI>Re&s;entment,</HI> are apt to throw out very har&s;h and cutting Things, and which when they are cool they are very &s;orry for; but, I don't hear that Mr. P&mdash;r has any &s;uch to produce again&s;t me; and I have no Rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that if I had &s;aid them, they would have e&s;caped his Ob&s;ervation: I would there|fore infer, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> that I could be in no very <HI>great Pa&s;&s;ion:</HI> I am &s;ure if I was, it was the mo&s;t <HI>fortunate Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> I ever was in in all my Life. That I expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome <HI>Re&s;entment</HI> at his coming I &s;hall not deny; but on the con|trary do &s;till a&s;&s;ert, that I had Rea&s;on &s;o to do: I do not di&s;pute, nor did I then, his Right to vi&s;it at any Time or Place; but I remon&s;trated to him, that it was very unu&s;ual to vi&s;it on that Night; and withal, that when Ma&s;ters of Arts were in Company, more Re&s;pect was always paid to them. This, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> is indi&s;pu|table. Mr. P&mdash;r &s;hould have &s;ent up to us; Mr. <HI>Wi&s;h</HI> de&s;ired him to do &s;o; but he would not. Mr. <HI>A&mdash;ll</HI> gave you a remarkable In|&s;tance of the Re&s;pect paid to our Degree, and I could give you &s;everal, were it nece&s;&s;ary to our Defence. There were Ma&s;ters of Arts, there were Under-Graduates in the Hou&s;e at that Time; but nobody was vi&s;ited, nobody taken Notice of, but the <HI>W&mdash;r</HI> Club.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> I in&s;i&s;t upon it, the Honour of the Senate ought to be &s;upported; but if the Members of it are to be brought into a Court in
<PB N="43" REF="42">
this Manner on every trifling Occa&s;ion; if a Look, a Laugh, a Smile, &s;hall &s;ubject <HI>them</HI> to Cen&s;ure and Puni&s;hment, how &s;hall the young|er Part of the U&mdash;y be induced to pay them that Deference and Regard which is due to their Station? I prote&s;t, for my own Part, I &s;hall for the future never expect it.</P>
<P>One Article more, and we have done. Mr. P&mdash;r depo&s;eth, that <Q REND="inline">"Mr. P-f-r called out <HI>here's to our next merry Meeting,</HI> which Words were twice at lea&s;t repeated, he added once, <HI>with|out Interruption from</HI> P&mdash;rs."</Q></P>
<P><HI>To our next merry Meeting,</HI> Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> was certainly the Health, and a very innocent Health it is. In what follows, Mr. P&mdash;r has indulged him&s;elf in his u&s;ual Licence of adding Words which were never &s;poke.</P>
<P>Here you will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, every Thing is po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted: It is not <HI>Words to this Pur|po&s;e,</HI> or <HI>to the be&s;t of my Remembrance,</HI> but the whole is confidently atte&s;ted. Now we do as confidently atte&s;t, that the Health, as related by the P&mdash;r, was not drunk. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>F&mdash;r,</HI> the Gentleman who attended the P&mdash;r, being a&s;ked, if he heard any Toa&s;t propo&s;ed, an&s;wered in the Affirmative, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"To our next merry Meeting, and that he believed the Words <HI>without Interruption,</HI> &amp;c. were added, by <HI>&s;omebody,</HI> but he could not &s;ay <HI>who.</HI>"</Q></NOTE></P>
<P>In Matters, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> where every Thing mu&s;t depend on Words as related by the <HI>Plain|tiff,</HI> the utmo&s;t Caution &s;hould be u&s;ed; be|cau&s;e the Addition of a &s;ingle Word, nay a &s;ingle Syllable, may entirely change the State
<PB N="44" REF="43">
of the Ca&s;e in Que&s;tion; and I have known a Cau&s;e of a criminal Nature laid a&s;ide, merely on Account of the mi&s;-&s;pelling of a Name. Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> you mu&s;t allow, that if an Accu&s;er has the Liberty of adding or taking away Words at his Plea&s;ure, there is nothing which can be &s;aid, but may very ea&s;ily be proved ac|tually to have been &s;aid, and con&s;equently in &s;uch a Ca&s;e no Ju&s;tice can be expected.</P>
<P>And now, Mr. <HI>V. C. and Gentlemen of the Court,</HI> I have, as briefly as I could, an&s;wered tho&s;e Parts of the general Charge which might be thought to remain unconfuted, and withal every Article &s;eparately which related to my|&s;elf; and I make no Doubt but that Things have now quite another Face than when partial|ly and imperfectly repre&s;ented to you. Had I been apprehen&s;ive I was before Men who&s;e Minds were tainted by Prejudice, or who would have wre&s;ted any Thing to my future Di&s;ad|vantage, I &s;hould not have &s;poken with that Openne&s;s and Freedom which I have ven|tured to make u&s;e of: But I hope I &s;peak to Men unbia&s;&s;ed and uninfluenced. You, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> have indulged us in a free Liberty of De|fence, and given us a fair and equitable Hear|ing. The &s;ame Candour, with which you have hitherto acted in the Cour&s;e of the&s;e Pro|ceedings, we al&s;o expect in your Determina|tion of them.

that not one &s;ingle Article again&s;t my&s;elf proved; you &s;ee, that the whole Depo&s;ition is perplexed and confu&s;ed, and you will be plea&s;ed to remember, that your Judgment mu&s;t re&s;t on the Proof of the Facts there alleged, and on that only.</P>
<P>The Statutes, Mr. <HI>V.

On that Honour, that Integrity, and Humanity, we firmly and willingly re&s;t our Cau&s;e. You will con&s;ider, Mr. <HI>V.

<P>I know it has been &s;aid by many, that the Honour of the U&mdash;y is concerned to &s;upport a P&mdash;r; and &s;o it is al&s;o, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> to

<P>I believe, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> every one here &s;ees, (and none I hope with greater Plea&s;ure than your|&s;elf) that I am entirely innocent. If I have been obliged to expo&s;e the Ab&s;urdities, Per|plexity, and Confu&s;ion of Mr. <HI>B&mdash;n</HI>'s Evi|dence, it was what I could by no Means avoid. It was an ill-founded, groundle&s;s Accu&s;ation, and therefore he de&s;erved it: He was di&s;&s;uaded from the Pro&s;ecution by many, but per&s;i&s;ted; and if the Odium con&s;equent on &s;uch Beha|viour be general, I cannot help it.</P>
<P>To your Determination therefore, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> and <HI>A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors,</HI> we &s;ubmit our Cau&s;e; and from you we hope all the Amends which can now be made us, to be honouraby cleared; but this mu&s;t be left to your own Brea&s;t.</P>

Mr. <HI>F&mdash;n</HI> having fini&s;hed his Defence, Mr. <HI>C&mdash;w</HI> addre&s;s'd the <HI>V. C.</HI> as follows.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="defense">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> and Gentlemen of the Court,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE general Behaviour of the <HI>W&mdash;r</HI> Club on the 17th In&s;tant, and particu|larly that of the pre&s;iding Members, has now been &s;o clearly explained, and the Facts alleged again&s;t us by Mr. P&mdash;r &s;o fully an&s;wered, that I &s;hould greatly infringe upon that Time which to every Member of this Place dedicated to private Study mu&s;t be &s;o precious, &s;hould I detain the Court by attempting to enlarge upon what has been already &s;o well urged in behalf of our Conduct.</P>
<P>But I hope it will not be taken ami&s;s, if, before I proceed to the Defence of my own Behaviour, and to an&s;wer that Part of the ge|neral Accu&s;ation which affects my&s;elf, if I do join with Mr. P&mdash;f&mdash;r <HI>F&mdash;n,</HI> and Mr. <HI>A&mdash;ll</HI> in this Ob&s;ervation, that, when Ma&s;ters of Arts, one of them particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed, &s;everal Fellows of Colleges, and many other Gentle|men of great Reputation, who&s;e Characters have from their Admi&s;&s;ion to this Time re|mained unblemi&s;hed, do receive &s;uch a Di&s;|grace as to be publicly cited to this Court, that the Facts might be expected to be of a more extraordinary Nature, or at lea&s;t much better &s;upported, than I flatter my&s;elf they really ap|pear to every candid and impartial Hearer.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="47">
But this Con&s;ideration I &s;ubmit to the Judg|ment of the Court: And I hope Mr. P&mdash;r will not take it ill, if I mention what I think it is my Duty to declare, as my real and &s;incere Opinion, that either through Defect of Me|mory, or perhaps through that Confu&s;ion which Mr. P&mdash;r acknowleges he was in at the Time, he has mi&s;taken &s;ome of the Facts, mi&s;repre&s;ented others, and I have Rea&s;on to believe has in a great mea&s;ure mi&s;con&s;trued the whole.</P>
<P>I need not mention Particulars, which have been already urged in Proof of this: But I could not an&s;wer it to my Con&s;cience, did I not beg leave to &s;peak only with regard to one Particular alleged again&s;t Mr. <HI>A&mdash;ll, viz.</HI> That when he de&s;ired Mr. P&mdash;r to ob&s;erve the Sobriety of the Club, he &s;hould &s;eem to ex|pre&s;s him&s;elf with a <HI>Sneer.</HI> I &s;tood clo&s;e to Mr. <HI>A&mdash;ll</HI> at this Time, and took particular Notice of him, and I do from my Heart de|clare, that as far as it is po&s;&s;ible to judge of the inward Thoughts from the outward Behaviour; as far as it is po&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h the real Sen|timents of the Heart from the Expre&s;&s;ions of the Tongue, (which I allow is extremely diffi|cult;) yet, as far as my Penetration reaches, I think the Look, the Ge&s;ture, the very Sound of Mr. <HI>A&mdash;ll</HI>'s Voice, and the Manner of delivering him&s;elf, te&s;tified quite the contrary: And as a further Proof of Mr. <HI>A&mdash;ll</HI>'s Zeal to &s;hew all proper Re&s;pect to Mr. P&mdash;r, on re|ceiving
<PB N="49" REF="48">
Applau&s;e from the Company for what he had &s;aid, he immediately, with as much tender Concern as any Man could expre&s;s on the Occa&s;ion, begged all the Gentlemen to of|fer no In&s;ult to the P&mdash;r; in which Petition Mr. P&mdash;f&mdash;r <HI>F&mdash;n</HI> and my&s;elf very &s;trenuou&s;ly joined. I might mention other particulars al|leged again&s;t the &s;ame Gentleman, as well as again&s;t Mr. P&mdash;f&mdash;r <HI>F&mdash;n,</HI> in which I am per|&s;uaded Mr. P&mdash;r is very much mi&s;taken; but tho&s;e Gentlemen have &s;o well defended them|&s;elves, that I &s;hall only add one Ob&s;ervation or two more in general, and proceed to an&s;wer to my own Charge.</P>
<P>And <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I cannot but believe, that every candid Hearer will allow that the Behaviour of the pre&s;iding Members, our Attendance at the Club purpo&s;ely to pre&s;erve Regularity and Sobriety, our previous Re&s;olution to &s;ee the Gentlemen depart by the &s;tatutable Hour, our zealous Endeavours to execute what we had re|&s;olved, (which Endeavours had &s;ucceeded, but for that Deficiency in the Reckoning, which, to my Knowlege, detained many, who were de|&s;ired to &s;tay 'till it was made up;) that the&s;e Circum&s;tances make us de&s;erving of Applau&s;e rather than Reproach, and ought to gain us the Thanks of the Officers of the U&mdash;y, ra|ther than be the Means of bringing us to our public Trial. I mu&s;t ob&s;erve further, as a Proof of the Regularity of my School-fellows, that I believe there never was &s;o large an A&s;|&s;embly,
<PB N="50" REF="49">
comprized chiefly of Youth, met to|gether upon &s;o extraordinary an Occa&s;ion, in which any public Officer could expect to find fewer Marks either of Riot or Intempe|rance.</P>
<P>But to ha&s;ten to what regards my&s;elf:&mdash;Be|fore I an&s;wer Particulars, give me leave, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> to ob&s;erve in general, that, as I have been upwards of &s;even Years of this U&mdash;y, have now the Honour to be a Member of the Senate, and Fellow of one of the principal Colleges; that, as during all this Time I have &s;hewn the greate&s;t Regard to the Laws of the Place, have behaved with as much Regularity my&s;elf as any other Member, and promoted the &s;ame as much in others, I think, and I flat|ter my&s;elf the whole Court will think it highly improbable, I &s;hould at this Time of Day be|gin to trample upon Authority, or in&s;ult any public Officer in the Execution of his Duty.</P>
<P>The Credit therefore of the School I come from, the Honour of the U&mdash;y, and particularly of the College I belong to, but, what is more to me in my private Capacity, my own Repute with tho&s;e, who have honoured me from my Admi&s;&s;ion to this Time with their Friend&s;hip and Patronage, oblige me to en|deavour to wipe off that Stain which my Cha|racter may po&s;&s;ibly receive, from this Accu&s;a|tion, in the Eyes of them and many others, who have hitherto, I am per&s;uaded, entertained a very different Opinion of me.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="50">
The fir&s;t Fact I &s;tand particularly charged with is, in Mr. P&mdash;r's Words, That <Q REND="inline">"I in&s;i&s;ted it was rude and uncivil, or <HI>Words to this Pur|po&s;e,</HI> in him to vi&s;it, when there were Ma&s;ters of Arts in Company, and one of them a P-f-r;"</Q> and that I a&s;ked him, <Q REND="inline">"if he did not think us able to take Care of the young Gentlemen in Company:"</Q> To which he replied, <Q REND="inline">"It did not appear we had done &s;o, for it was now pa&s;t Eleven."</Q></P>
<P>This Reply of Mr. P&mdash;r's, I hope I may &s;ay without Offence, &s;eems to intimate, that he rather meant to vindicate him&s;elf than prove any In&s;ult offered to, or Interruption in, his Office from <HI>me;</HI> unle&s;s he calls the remon&s;tra|ting to him his unprecedented Behaviour to Ma&s;ters of Arts, and Want of that Civility which the &s;tricte&s;t Officers have always paid to that Degree, an In&s;ult; unle&s;s he calls that an Interruption in his Office, which was meant to &s;hew him, how far we had been in&s;trumental our&s;elves in promoting that Regularity and So|briety, which Mr. <HI>A&mdash;ll</HI> de&s;ired him to take Notice of.</P>
<P>The next Article, if meant as an Accu&s;ation, is, with Submi&s;&s;ion to the Court, of a very extraordinary Nature; &s;ince I never knew be|fore, that it was criminal to receive Applau&s;e; nor can I imagine, that any of the Court, or even Mr P&mdash;r him&s;elf, will think it more &s;o to be delighted with it; to be delighted with the Approbation of my School-fellows for
<PB N="52" REF="51">
&s;peaking in &s;upport of the Privileges of a Ma&s;|ter of Arts, and of the Deference, which I perhaps ignorantly thought might be expected to be paid by any Officer of the U&mdash;y to a P-f-r in the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The two remaining Articles again&s;t me are, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That <Q REND="inline">"I in&s;i&s;ted it was &s;trange, or <HI>Words to that Effect,</HI> that the Execution of the&s;e Orders &s;hould be begun at the <HI>W&mdash;r</HI> Club;"</Q> and <HI>Secondly,</HI> That I further &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"We &s;carcely know what the&s;e Orders are; which to be ob&s;erved, and which not; and complained, <HI>in general Words,</HI> that it appeared &s;ome were executed and &s;ome not."</Q></P>
<P>That the Words, which Mr. P&mdash;r has put into my Mouth in the fir&s;t Part of this Charge, are &s;uch as I made U&s;e of, I believe I may venture to deny; &s;ince I was far from thinking, that it's being the <HI>W&mdash;r</HI> Club, gave it a greater Sanction, or exempted it from any le|gal Vi&s;itation more than another; but meant to &s;ignify, that as an annual Meeting, at which Ma&s;ters of Arts pre&s;ided, it might not unrea|&s;onably hope for a little more Indulgence than is u&s;ually allowed to a private Company: And Mr. P&mdash;r mu&s;t have greatly mi&s;taken my Words in the other Part of the Charge, to accu&s;e me of denying my Knowlege of the&s;e Orders; &s;ince I prote&s;t, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> I &s;aid no|thing to any &s;uch Purpo&s;e, and I believe your|&s;elf and the re&s;t of the Court will think it high|ly improbable I &s;hould, when I had the new
<PB N="53" REF="52">
Regulations at that very Time in my Pocket, and was pre&s;ent when they pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The&s;e, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> are all the Articles par|ticularly alleged again&s;t me; to which how far and how clearly I have an&s;wer'd, I will|ingly leave to your Determination; which I hope will be &s;uch, as to clear me entirely from any A&s;per&s;ions which this Accu&s;ation may have thrown upon me; and that I may not now begin to appear the Promoter of Irregularity, and the Encourager of Di&s;obedience, who have &s;o long given Te&s;timony of a far different Di&s;po&s;ition.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>V&mdash;n</HI> then being a&s;ked by the <HI>V. C.</HI> if he had any Thing to &s;ay in An&s;wer to the P&mdash;r's Accu&s;ation, &s;poke thus:</P>
<Q><TEXT>
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="defense">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> and Gentlemen of the Court,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am here called upon publicly to vindi|cate my Character which has been &s;tigma|tized through the whole U&mdash;y, upon Mr. P&mdash;r's Accu&s;ation of having, in a particular Manner, di&s;tingui&s;hed my&s;elf in the Affronts he pretends were put upon his Office the Night he vi&s;ited the <HI>W&mdash;r</HI> Meeting; and having added In&s;ults to that Injury, when he called upon me to give an Account of my Conduct at his Room.</P>
<P>So much has been already &s;poken, and &s;o ju&s;tly, in Vindication, as well of the Conduct of the <HI>Ma&s;ters of Arts,</HI> as of all the Members
<PB N="54" REF="53">
of the Society without Exception; that (&s;hould it be thought incumbent on me to an&s;wer this Part of my Charge at all, as I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew Rea&s;on why I &s;hould not) a few Ob|&s;ervations would be &s;ufficient to qua&s;h and fal|&s;ify &s;uch a frivolous and ill-&s;upported Accu|&s;ation.</P>
<P>And here it is a Satisfaction to me, that I can, if nece&s;&s;ary, &s;upport my Confutation of this Part of my Charge, by the Evidence of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Gentleman, being one of the Club, tho' by Mi&s;take not cited into Court, was not permitted to appear as an Evidence in Mr. <HI>V&mdash;n</HI>'s Favour.</NOTE> a Gentleman, a Fellow of a College, and who not being &s;ummoned as an Accomplice, will I hope appear a more unexceptionable Witne&s;s than a Per&s;on who&s;e Confu&s;ion had led him into the numberle&s;s Mi&s;takes and Calumnies, which have been amply &s;et forth by the Gentlemen who have &s;o fully an&s;wered their Parts of the Charge already.</P>
<P>To begin with the fir&s;t Objection, which I have already hinted, I mu&s;t beg leave to re|mind the Court of the &s;urprizing Incident by which Mr. P&mdash;r had the Happine&s;s to di&s;|cover that heinous Offender, who&s;e rude and in&s;olent Behaviour had &s;truck him, in &s;o par|ticular a Manner, amid&s;t the univer&s;al In&s;ult he &s;o loudly complains of. He tells you, his fir&s;t Su&s;picion light on Mr. <HI>V&mdash;e;</HI> who having cleared him&s;elf, our <HI>Accu&s;er</HI> finds him&s;elf once more at a Lo&s;s for his Culprit, and a whole Day pa&s;&s;es before his good Fortune throws in
<PB N="55" REF="54">
his Way a fal&s;e and malicious Report, which having compared with his own confu&s;ed Recol|lection of what had pa&s;&s;ed, or rather Invention of what had not pa&s;&s;ed, he fixes his Charge upon me; a Per&s;on whom he confe&s;&s;ed, at his Chambers, he had not the lea&s;t previous Know|lege of, nor did he pretend, when I appeared, to recollect me: And as he al&s;o chu&s;es to conceal the Author of his Intelligence, it is probable and will I hope inconte&s;tably appear, that his In|former was as ignorant in that re&s;pect as him&s;elf.</P>
<P>From &s;uch Conjectures, and &s;uch hear-&s;ay Evidence, he makes not the lea&s;t Scruple to affirm, that I am the Per&s;on he pretends to have great Rea&s;on for Complaint again&s;t; and as I have always heard, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the Accu&s;er &s;hould be po&s;itive in his Proofs of the Per&s;on of the Accu&s;ed, even before he is per|mitted to give his Charge, I hope it will ap|pear Time to call for &s;ome more unexceptionable Evidence than the Repetition of a Calumny communicated by a Per&s;on, who&s;e Name is to remain a Secret. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> here a&s;ked, if Mr. <HI>V&mdash;n</HI> would re&s;t his Defence there. He replied, he would readily proceed to examine the Articles of the Charge, provided this Objection might have it's due Weight; which was promi&s;ed. It mu&s;t here be ob&s;erved, that the Per&s;on, who attended Mr. P&mdash;r, &s;wore fir&s;t, that he ob|&s;erved no &s;uch Behaviour as is, in the Charge, attributed to Mr. <HI>V&mdash;n,</HI> from any Per&s;on. And &s;econdly, that he did not know Mr. <HI>V&mdash;n</HI> at the Time they vi&s;ited the Meeting.</NOTE></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Article of the Charge accu&s;es me <Q REND="inline">"of laughing in his, the P&mdash;r's, Face, and behaving otherwi&s;e very in&s;olently."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="55">
If &s;o laudable an Occa&s;ion of meeting my Friends, and renewing earlie&s;t Acquaintances, had inclined me to a more joyous Di&s;po&s;ition and A&s;pect, than the &s;olemn Appearance of &s;uch an Officer as Mr. P&mdash;r required, I hope that Con&s;ideration (and not the In&s;olence that Gentleman a&s;cribes as the Motive) will be thought to have occa&s;ioned the gay Appear|ance which &s;eems &s;o much to have &s;hocked him, and I can't help applying on this Occa&s;ion that equitable Maxim with which Mr. <HI>A&mdash;ll</HI> concluded his Defence,
<Q><L>Inter di&s;pares Sententias, mitior vincat.</L></Q></P>
<P>The next Article &s;ays, that <Q REND="inline">"I continued to &s;hew &s;everal Marks of Rudene&s;s."</Q> This vague, no-meaning Article (as Mr. P&mdash;r &s;eems not to recollect the&s;e Marks) I may do well to pa&s;s in Silence.</P>
<P>Next follows, that I was going to reply to a Que&s;tion, he has thought proper to omit. I &s;hould not trouble you, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> with a Re|petition of the&s;e Heads of Accu&s;ation, if they were not alleged as Marks of &s;o ungentleman|like a Behaviour as In&s;olence, which is here endeavoured to be proved by candidly anticipa|ting Words which he &s;ays I was prevented from &s;peaking; Mr. P&mdash;f&mdash;r <HI>F&mdash;n,</HI> who he &s;aid was the Per&s;on that &s;topped me, a&s;&s;ured the Court he remember'd no &s;uch Attempt from me, nor any &s;uch Prevention on his Part: And this Part of my Accu&s;ation is concluded
<PB N="57" REF="56">
by affirming, they were to have been in&s;olent had they been uttered.</P>
<P>I come now to the &s;econd Part of Mr. P&mdash;r's Charge, where he has &s;elected &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions which appeared to him injurious to the Di&s;ci|pline and Officers of the U&mdash;y. Had he been plea&s;ed to deliver the whole Sentences in which tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions were contained, I &s;hould, I am per&s;uaded, have &s;tood ab&s;olved from any &s;uch A&s;per&s;ion; and here I appre|hend it will again appear extraordinary, that Words &s;aid to be dropped from an accu&s;ed Per&s;on in a private Examination, &s;hould &s;erve to aggravate that Per&s;on's Charge in a Court of Equity.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Article on this &s;econd Head accu&s;es me of having talked much of my Indepen|dency. The World I remember to have u&s;ed, and to this Effect; that as I was not intimi|dated by any Dependence on the U&mdash;y, I was ready and willing to an&s;wer Mr. P&mdash;r's Accu&s;ation, at any Time and in any Place he &s;hould think proper to call upon me. This I &s;aid in an&s;wer to his a&s;king me, If I propo&s;ed to deny his Accu&s;ation in the &s;ame Manner I had done there, wherever I &s;hould be called to an Account.</P>
<P>I am next accu&s;ed of que&s;tioning him as to the Cu&s;toms of his Office; and what is more &s;trange, I am complained of in a Court of Ju&s;|tice for owning him capable to in&s;truct me. My Que&s;tion was, whether his Office obliged
<PB N="58" REF="57">
him to interrupt, in that rigorous Manner, &s;o regular and &s;olemn a Meeting as the Celebra|tion of the Anniver&s;ary of our Benefactre&s;s.</P>
<P>The following carry &s;o dubious an Air, that I que&s;tion, if Mr. P&mdash;r's Memory (though in no &s;mall E&s;teem with him) was not in this Ca&s;e a little &s;u&s;picious to him&s;elf; as the Terms are &s;o general and his a&s;&s;i&s;tant Expletives are &s;o frequently called in, (though very judiciou&s;ly, I mu&s;t confe&s;s;) as I apprehend, if it had not been for tho&s;e Licences of Rhetoric, the Words <HI>Sneer</HI> and <HI>Contemptuous</HI> being thrown in, the&s;e Articles could not bear the lea&s;t Colour of Offence.</P>
<P>Next comes an amphibious Article; and whether to con&s;ider it as an Accu&s;ation again&s;t, or an Excu&s;e for, the Per&s;on he is accu&s;ing, I am at a Lo&s;s; as his acquitting me of any In|tention to affront him is a new Expedient for corroborating a Charge of In&s;olence. He indeed &s;eems to have an&s;wered one End, which is en|deavouring to make it appear, that Mr. P&mdash;f&mdash;r <HI>F&mdash;n</HI> was the Man who received all our Ap|plau&s;e, and by that adding &s;ome Credibility to his malicious A&s;&s;ertions again&s;t him: But I do declare, that I &s;aid I applauded, to &s;ignify my Approbation of what was &s;aid by the Gentle|men, who took the Pains to &s;peak for the Company, without naming any particular Per|&s;on. This I thought it incumbent upon me to mention, as I ob&s;erved the &s;ame In&s;inuation in Mr. <HI>V&mdash;e</HI>'s Charge.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="58">
His la&s;t Article &s;eems calculated to prejudice the U&mdash;y again&s;t me; if indeed Men of Sen&s;e could be &s;u&s;pected to be bia&s;&s;ed by a Declara|tion of Mr. <HI>B&mdash;n</HI>'s Opinion of what will be my future Conduct.</P>
<P>Having briefly gone through every Article of a Charge grounded on Hear&s;ay, and re&s;ting on Mr. P&mdash;r's Interpretations of Looks, Re|flections on Words &s;poke and about to be &s;po|ken, his Notions of Ge&s;tures, and Pre&s;agings of future Events; nothing now remains, but that I return my particular Thanks to you, Mr. <HI>V. C.</HI> and to the Gentlemen of the U&mdash;y in general, for &s;o candid and attentive a Hear|ing, and for that De&s;ire &s;hewn, &s;o much to their Honour, of hearing my Confutation of one of the &s;evere&s;t of Charges had it been proved; I mean the Contempt of &s;uperior Au|thority, mildly and impartially exerted: And having had an Opportunity to clear my&s;elf in their Eyes, adds not a little to the Satisfaction I &s;hall receive in finding my&s;elf ab&s;olved by &s;o equitable and unexceptionable a Judge.</P>
