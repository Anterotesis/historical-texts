<P>I Have repeatedly a&s;&s;ured the Public, that they &s;hall be faithfully acquainted from whence I borrow any Materials to work up my Dramatic Trifles. In the METAMORPHOSES will be found &s;ome incidents taken from Moliere's <HI>Sicilien,</HI> par|ticularly the circum&s;tances of Don Pedro's giving away his ward in a mi&s;take, which is here ex|actly as it is in the French.</P>
<P>THE Servant who from &s;implicity betrays his Ma&s;ter's &s;ecrets will be directly known, for a chacter in <HI>George Dandin.</HI> In &s;hort what is taken from the&s;e two Comedies, together with hints from &s;ome other Publications make near a third of the Piece.</P>
<P>THUS have I faithfully performed my promi&s;e to the Public, who&s;e kind Protection I &s;hould very little merit could I deceive them.</P>

<P>My dear Marcella, 'tis becau&s;e my love is &s;o very delicate I take offence at even a &s;mile, or a glance, that any per&s;on forces from you; and the care you &s;ee me take, is for nothing el&s;e but to debar all acce&s;s of galants, and &s;ecure to my&s;elf the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a heart, the lea&s;t thing relative to which I can't bear to think any body &s;hould rob me of.</P>

<P>In good truth you take a very wrong method, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a heart is very ill &s;ecured, when people think to keep it up by force. For my part, was I gallant to a lady in the power of another, I &s;hou'd bend all my
