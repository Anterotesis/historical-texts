<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>OF literary performances, a work like the pre&s;ent, might be permitted to appear, without the accu&s;tomed ornament of a Preface; for what are MISCELLANIES, but a kind of Pre|faces? They are rather introduc|tions to &s;ubjects, than &s;ubjects them|&s;elves; and like Prefaces, are fre|quently more plea&s;ing, than the completer works.</P>
<P>In the&s;e pages I have arranged &s;ome of the materials of my ob|&s;ervation, and have blown into a little flame, &s;ome &s;parks of learning.
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
To adorn critici&s;m with imagery, and to e&s;tabli&s;h ob&s;ervation by anec|dote, has, if I err not, a claim on the public indulgence; for it can|not be &s;aid that we have many books of this race. Of all Europe, we have excelled in the mi&s;cellaneous mode of writing; but our's has been generally addre&s;&s;ed to the ima|gination, and not much to literary curio&s;ity. A manner of compo&s;ition very &s;uperior to that which this vo|lume exhibits; &s;ince the knowledge which regulates the pa&s;&s;ions of the heart, is more valuable than that which furni&s;hes the ideas of the head; for virtue is permanent, but opinion is un&s;table. Writings which awaken our &s;en&s;ibility by fiction, mu&s;t plea&s;e more generally than books which only in&s;truct our judgment by truths; for I have ob&s;erved, that
<PB N="vii" REF="5">
mo&s;t are more wearied by idlene&s;s, than di&s;turbed by ignorance.</P>
<P>In this book are &s;entiments which, ancient or new, judicious or erro|neous, may probably encounter con|troverters. The apparent errors of an author, &s;ometimes proceed from the ambiguity, or imperfect expre&s;|&s;ion of his conceptions; but &s;ome|times from the prejudices and inabi|lities of his critics. Of literary opi|nions I &s;hall not be unrea&s;onably te|nacious; for whatever &s;ome authors may imagine, the concerns of mere literature, are not very material in the &s;y&s;tem of human life. They are objects, however, more innocent to di&s;cu&s;s, than topics more prevalent. The oppo&s;ite opinions of periodical critics have afforded me &s;ome amu&s;e|ment, &s;ome in&s;truction, and &s;ome indignation, and in want of a &s;ubject
<PB N="viii" REF="6">
for this Preface, that of their cha|racter may not be unintere&s;ting to the lover of literature.</P>
<P>When we abound with periodical critics, we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily abound with erroneous critici&s;m. Some have their old prejudices, &s;ome their new follies, and &s;ome their incura|ble imbecillity; for impotence is ra|dical. Rarely we find a critic who&s;e exten&s;ive powers are familiar with what has been done, and what is doing; who&s;e &s;agacity not only di&s;|covers the real abilities of an author, but, with a pre&s;cient di&s;cernment, can judge to what his future powers may be competent; and by his vi|gour of conception, and delicacy of ta&s;te, exhibit beauties kindred to the fine original he reviews.</P>
<P>Literary journals conducted by an intelligent editor, abound with the
<PB N="ix" REF="7">
plea&s;ures and the utilities of letters; but certainly with &s;uch an editor every Review is not provided. The per&s;onal irritation of men of genius has depreciated the&s;e records of lite|rature; and &s;uch errors have been &s;trangely propagated, with the ad|ditional extravagancies of per&s;ons, not conver&s;ant with literary affairs. Some yet believe a Review to be com|po&s;ed by a junto, who, in black coats, and with grave faces, a&s;&s;emble around <Q REND="inline">"a board of green cloth."</Q> The in|terior of a Review has nothing of it's apparent complexity; the entire machine is revolved by a &s;olitary hand, &s;ometimes with experienced dexterity, and &s;ometimes with ca|&s;ual imbecillity.</P>
<P>It is certain, that the plea&s;ure of running over fifty books in an hour, is a voluptuous indulgence for every
<PB N="x" REF="8">
literary idler; and authors feel a great curio&s;ity in taking in at a glance, what is performing by their contemporaries. To &s;tudents remote from the metropolis, it is only by the intermediate aid of the&s;e period|ical pages, that they can form an ac|quaintance with the public ta&s;te. A review is a literary arena, where young writers learn to wre&s;tle with their rivals.</P>
<P>When &s;uch is the intere&s;t and the &s;agacity of a conductor, that &s;ome of the literary characters of the age are invited to take a &s;hare in the&s;e works, they receive an addi|tional importance, and form a valu|able acce&s;&s;ion to the trea&s;uries of li|terature. At a future day they are con&s;ulted to detect the vulnerable parts of our literary heroes; to ob|tain accounts of ob&s;cure publications
<PB N="xi" REF="9">
often nece&s;&s;ary in the hi&s;tory of let|ters; and to reflect on the manner in which the literary world received certain works, di&s;tingui&s;hed at their fir&s;t appearance, by the novelties of their &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable, that men, who&s;e deci&s;ions are regarded on the works of the fir&s;t writers, are them&s;elves unknown, and voluntarily preclude all reputation by their &s;tudied &s;e|cre&s;y. By &s;ome no additional repu|tation is wanted. Two intere&s;ts &s;ti|mulate the writers of reviews; the plea&s;ure of examining new publica|cations; or the petty &s;tipend of lite|rary pay, too often nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ome men of genius. I am of opinion, that this ob&s;curity is favourable to their powers. To whatever is known more by it's effects, than by it's cau&s;e, the imagination is friendly.
<PB N="xii" REF="10">
If great names appeared to the arti|cles of a Review, the public and the author would abrogate their deci|&s;ions; we &s;hould &s;ometimes protect the meane&s;t, that we might have the plea&s;ure of humbling the greate&s;t. It is not, therefore, with the deities of literature, as with tho&s;e of reli|gion; to attract and fix the vulgar, it was nece&s;&s;ary to inflame them with vi&s;ible Gods; but here their invi&s;i|bility is their omnipotence.</P>
<P>On the nece&s;&s;ity of anonymous critici&s;m, a more &s;erious ob&s;ervation occurs. If this &s;ecre&s;y were unre|garded, it would be often fatal to the critic. Motley, indeed, is that va&s;t collection of men, who enli&s;t under the banners of literature, and our Republic of Letters is di&s;graced with numerous Sans-culottes. While the deci&s;ions of critici&s;m are received
<PB N="xiii" REF="11">
with re&s;ignation, by the mode&s;t, the de&s;perate would accompany them with an "Appendix" on the weak frame of a Reviewer. I knew a wild Highlander, ju&s;t e&s;caped from the Orkneys, who threatened extermina|tion to his Reviewers, and watched through the cold moon&s;hine of De|cember, at the door of his critic, who was then fortunately retained in his apartment by the gout; while another, with le&s;s inhumanity, commenced a &s;uit at law, for having been taxed with plagiari&s;ms and &s;cot|tici&s;ms.</P>
<P>To young writers, and to general readers, who are always young in li|terature, a Reviewer may offer an important in&s;truction, when at the appearance of a work of magnitude, he commences his article with con|den&s;ing the chief rules of compo&s;i|tion,
<PB N="xiv" REF="12">
relating to the work he exa|mines, and with characters of the preceding writers. Of this happy mode of Reviewing, many beauti|ful &s;pecimens are exhibited in the Monthly Review. As models, I recollect two recent in&s;tances; the Reviews of Murphy's Tacitus, and Beresford's Virgil.</P>
<P>The defects of periodical critici&s;m are more numerous, than can be rea&s;onably allowed, to men of learn|ing and candour; it is evident, in|deed, that our critics have &s;ometimes neither learning nor candour. A friend, an adver&s;ary, or the author him&s;elf, are all bad critics. It is a cruel proce&s;s of critical alchemy, when a Reviewer plays his game on the principles of what is technically termed at whi&s;t, a &s;ee-&s;aw. Two &s;uits are made to an&s;wer each other;
<PB N="xv" REF="13">
and prai&s;e and cen&s;ure are &s;o &s;kilfully contra&s;ted, that one would defeat the other, did not the cen&s;ure of an author ever cau&s;e a &s;tronger &s;en&s;a|tion than all his prai&s;e. Thus to &s;catter eulogiums, is like the ancient prie&s;t, who wreathed with flowers and gilded, the horns of the victim he conducted to bleed on the altar. Sometimes we are informed that an author is lively and ingenious, but not profound and learned. Such in|&s;idious detractions are certain of in|juring his literary character. It is nece&s;&s;ary to tell the public, what an author <HI>is;</HI> endle&s;s were it to enume|rate what he <HI>is not;</HI> it is de&s;cribing a non-entity. Such literary contra&s;ts are unju&s;t; becau&s;e they imply defi|ciencies, which are not deficiencies; they are only qualities incompatible with the di&s;po&s;itions of the author.
<PB N="xvi" REF="14">
Sometimes a Reviewer, perceiving his inability to decide on a work, forms an article in the manner of an enigma, with a dark and intricate ingenuity; he decides on nothing, but appears very deci&s;ive; nor is that critici&s;m more u&s;eful, which pre&s;ents to a reader an idea of a work, in the expre&s;s terms employed by an au|thor in his Preface; it is well known, than an author ever indulges his pa&s;|&s;ion for the <Q REND="inline">"beau ideal,"</Q> in his explanation of his work. Every thing there is perfect in theory; and the critic who will accept the pro|fe&s;&s;ions of authors, will find innu|merable perfect works. Lavi&s;hly to cen&s;ure the peculiarities of a writer, is a defect in critici&s;m; to delineate his manner, is a duty. Point and antithe&s;is, &s;parkling imagery, and varieties of diction, are not adapted
<PB N="xvii" REF="15">
to every ta&s;te; but to a critic who &s;hould reprobate them, I would &s;ay, does any man of ta&s;te cen&s;ure Vol|taire and John&s;on? Would you de|&s;poil an author of his manner? You would then make Voltaire, not Vol|taire, and John&s;on, not John&s;on. Egregious critic! to make him plea&s;e the world, you would have him re|&s;emble <HI>your&s;elf!</HI>&mdash;The world and you have not agreed on the &s;ame model. Some critics incapable of forming opinions of their own, &s;ei&s;e any prevalent one; their heads are continually changing principles, like tho&s;e towns in Flanders, which are as often under the government of the Republicans, as the Imperiali&s;ts. In echoing the public voice there is no individual merit. Does &s;uch a critici&s;m de&s;erve publication? No! it is a critici&s;m <HI>already publi&s;hed.</HI> An
<PB N="xviii" REF="16">
intelligent Reviewer anticipates the public opinion.</P>
<P>To form a Review into an in&s;tru|ment of torture, &s;portively to lace|rate the &s;en&s;ibilities of men of ge|nius, was the artifice of the Frerons, and the Des Fontaines; when their Journals lay on the &s;helf, they aug|mented their malignancy in the en|&s;uing month, and when the writers were fairly lodged in the Ba&s;tile, the &s;ale was con&s;iderable. Kenrick wrote with a poi&s;oned and remor&s;e|le&s;s pen. This violation of the mo|rality of critici&s;m, extingui&s;hes the genius of the mode&s;t &s;tudent. Such critics re&s;emble the Remora, that petty fi&s;h, which the ancients ima|gined could impede a &s;hip under full &s;ail.</P>
<P>A Review, conducted with &s;kill, &s;hould pre&s;ent the literary phy&s;iog|nomy
<PB N="xix" REF="17">
of the century. In an age of refinement, the public ta&s;te is in a &s;tate of vacillation; and no mean art, or limited knowledge, can catch, with faithful re&s;emblance, <Q REND="inline">"the Cynthia of the minute."</Q> We abound with literary fa&s;hions, and have no other mode of recording and perpe|tuating our prevalent ta&s;tes, but in the&s;e u&s;eful archives of literature. It is nece&s;&s;ary that the &s;tate of Eng|li&s;h literature, of former, as well as of the pre&s;ent times, be familiar to a Reviewer, for incidental ob|&s;ervations, and appropriate anec|dotes, variegate with flowers the thorns of critici&s;m, and, not merely delightful, exhibit an intelligent and connective &s;eries. Above all, a pe|riodical critic &s;hould dive&s;t him&s;elf of the rancour of faction; and that Reviewer, is as devoid of ta&s;te, as
<PB N="xx" REF="18">
of the morals of a critic, who, in the retired groves of Academus, would place a pillory, or erect a gal|lows.</P>
<P>I propo&s;ed, at the clo&s;e of this Preface, having been lately honoured by certain calumnies, to repel &s;uch in&s;olent accu&s;ations; but I have con|&s;idered, that this might give them, and my&s;elf, an importance to which neither is entitled. It is one of the inconveniencies attached to litera|ture, that, in contending times like the pre&s;ent, every ingenuous writer mu&s;t inevitably offend the two va&s;t divi&s;ions, in which we may now cla&s;s the European public. As every thing in this world revolves in a circle, and our follies, and our er|rors, are dull repetitions of former follies, and former errors; this, al&s;o, was a complaint of that amiable lite|rary
<PB N="xxi" REF="19">
character, Era&s;mus, who, in his &s;tormy age of revolutions, tells us, that works of mere literature, were always confounded by the one party, as aids to Luther, or by the other, as &s;ervilities to the Court of Rome. A writer on literary topics, is now placed on a &s;harp precipice between politics and religion; and the public reward of all his anxieties, and all his toils, con&s;i&s;ts in the mutual de|nounciations of two di&s;hone&s;t fac|tions. Literary inve&s;tigation is allied neither to politics nor religion; it is a &s;cience con&s;ecrated to the few; ab&s;tracted from all the factions on earth; and independent of popular di&s;contents, and popular delu&s;ions. Men of letters, of all profe&s;&s;ions, are alone privileged to repeat the ver&s;es of a philo&s;ophic poet,

<HEAD>OF MISCELLANIES.</HEAD>
<P>HAD I the genius, I would deline|ate the character of a Mi&s;cellani&s;t; of whom I have formed an idea, perfect, though by &s;ome it may be deemed er|roneous. When Cicero de&s;cribed the character of an accompli&s;hed orator, he formed it from a perfect imagina|tion of oratory, which, like the fine ideal of Raphael, exi&s;ted no where but in his own admirable conceptions. Every writer of genius, when he has pourtrayed the requi&s;ites for an arti&s;t, in his favourite art, in the &s;ame man|ner rai&s;es and adorns them, by ex|cellencies, of which the nece&s;&s;ity can be felt by few, and the powers at|tained
<PB N="2" REF="24">
by none. Critics, of ordinary &s;agacity, have therefore often di&s;turbed the vi&s;ion, by cen&s;uring it's exqui&s;ite|ne&s;s and decreeing it's impo&s;&s;ibility. To &s;uch, we may ob&s;erve, that though we can rarely traver&s;e an expan&s;ive horizon, who, endowed with a vigor|ous vi&s;ion, delights not to expatiate along it's extremities? and while a &s;en&s;ation of delight aggrandi&s;es the &s;oul of &s;uch a &s;pectator, he will turn contemptuou&s;ly from the pitiful ob&s;er|vation of him, who with meaner op|tics, gravely admoni&s;hes, of impa&s;&s;able fore&s;ts, and unnavigable rivers. Per|fection though unattainable, mu&s;t &s;till be the frequent object of our contem|plation; becau&s;e every kind of excel|lence is a portion of perfection, and no portion can be accurately appreci|ated, if we are incapable of forming &s;ome idea of the whole.</P>
<P>I give &s;ome ob&s;ervations on Mi&s;cel|lanies, which, like their &s;ubject, may
<PB N="3" REF="25">
perhaps require an apology for their unconnected &s;tate. The Mi&s;cellani&s;ts &s;atiri&s;e the Pedants; and the Pedants abu&s;e the Mi&s;cellani&s;ts; but little has hitherto been gained by this inglorious conte&s;t; &s;ince Pedants will always be read by Pedants, and the Mi&s;cellani&s;ts by the ta&s;teful, the volatile, and the amiable.</P>
<P>Literary e&s;&s;ays are cla&s;&s;ed under philological &s;tudies; but philology for|merly con&s;i&s;ted rather of the labours of arid grammarians, and conjectural critics, than of that more elegant phi|lo&s;ophy which has been lately intro|duced into literature, and which by it's graces and inve&s;tigation, can aug|ment the beauties of original genius, by beauties of it's own.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved that philologi|cal pur&s;uits inflate the mind with a great &s;well of vanity, and have carried &s;ome men of learning to a curious and ridiculous extravagance. Perhaps this
<PB N="4" REF="26">
literary orga&s;m may ari&s;e from two cau&s;es. Philologi&s;ts are apt to form too exalted an opinion of the nature of their &s;tudies, while they often make their peculiar ta&s;te, a &s;tandard by which they judge of the &s;entiments of others. It is not thus with the &s;cien|tific and the moral writer; Science is mode&s;t and cautious, Morality is hum|ble and re&s;igned, while Philology alone is arrogant and po&s;itive. A <HI>fact</HI> in &s;cience is found with infinite labour, and may be overturned by a new di&s;|covery; and an <HI>action</HI> in morality may be &s;o mingled with human pa&s;&s;ions, that we he&s;itate to pronounce it perfect, and analy&s;e it with tranquillity. But it is not difficult with &s;ome to per&s;uade them&s;elves that Virgil is an immacu|late author, and that they are men of exqui&s;ite ta&s;te. The Pedants of the la&s;t age exerci&s;ed a vanity and ferocity revived by tho&s;e critics, who have been called Warburtonians. They
<PB N="5" REF="27">
employed &s;imilar language in their de|ci&s;ions to that of Du Moulin, a great lawyer of tho&s;e days who always pre|fixed to his con&s;ultations, this defiance, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I who yield to no per&s;on, and whom no per&s;on can teach any thing."</Q></P>
<P>By one of the&s;e was Montaigne, the venerable father of modern Mi&s;cella|nies, called <Q REND="inline">"a bold ignorant fellow."</Q> To thinking readers, this critical &s;um|mary will appear my&s;terious; for Mon|taigne had imbibed the &s;pirit of all the moral writers of antiquity; and although he has made a capricious complaint of a defective memory, we cannot but wi&s;h the complaint had been more real; for we di&s;cover in his works nearly as much compilement, as reflection, and he is one of tho&s;e authors who &s;hould quote rarely, but who de&s;erves to be often quoted. Montaigne was cen&s;ured by Scaliger, as Addi&s;on was cen&s;ured by Warbur|ton; becau&s;e both, like Socrates, per|ceived
<PB N="6" REF="28">
and reprobated that mere eru|dition, which con&s;i&s;ts of knowing the thoughts of others, and having no thoughts of our own. To weigh &s;yl|lables, and to arrange dates, to adju&s;t texts, and to heap annotations, has generally proved the ab&s;ence of the higher faculties. But when a more adventurous &s;pirit, of this herd, at|tempted &s;ome novel di&s;covery, often men of ta&s;te beheld, with indignation, the perver&s;ions of their under&s;tanding; and a Bentley in his Milton, or a War|burton on a Virgil, had either a &s;in|gular imbecillity concealed under the arrogance of the Scholar, or they did not believe what they told the Public; the one in his extraordinary invention of an interpolating editor, and the other in his more extraordinary ex|planation of the Eleu&s;inian my&s;teries. But what was &s;till wor&s;e, the froth of the head became venom, when it reached the heart.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="29">
Montaigne has al&s;o been cen&s;ured for an apparent vanity, in making him|&s;elf the idol of his lucubrations. If he had not done this, he had not per|formed the promi&s;e he makes at the commencement of his preface. An engaging tenderne&s;s prevails in the&s;e <HI>naive</HI> expre&s;&s;ions, which &s;hall not be injured by a ver&s;ion. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Je l'ay vou&eacute; &agrave; la commodit&eacute; particuliere de mes Pa|rens et Amis; &agrave; ce que m'ayans perdu (ce qu'ils ont &agrave; faire biento&s;t) ils y pui&s;&s;ent retrouver quelques traicts de mes humeurs, et que par ce moyen ils nourri&s;&s;ent plus entiere et plus vifue la conoi&s;&s;ance qu'ils ont eu de moi.'<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From the preface to his E&s;&s;ays which did not ap|pear in the earlie&s;t Editions, and is omitted in Cot|ton's ver&s;ion.

<P>Tho&s;e authors who appear &s;ome|times to forget they are writers, and remember they are men, will be our favourites. He who writes from the heart, will write to the heart; every one is enabled to decide on his merits,

and they will not be referred to more learned heads, or a more di&s;tant pe|riod. We are I think little intere&s;ted if an author di&s;plays &s;ublimity, but we &s;hould be much concerned to know whether he has &s;incerity.</P>

<P>Why it may be enquired have &s;ome of our fine writers intere&s;ted more than others, who have not di&s;played infe|rior talents? becau&s;e they have rai&s;ed no artificial emotions, but poured forth the vigorous expre&s;&s;ions of a heart, which &s;eemed relieved from an oppre&s;|&s;ion of &s;en&s;ibility, as it's ardent &s;enti|ments animated every period. Mon|taigne therefore preferred tho&s;e of the ancients, who appear to write under a conviction of what they &s;aid; the elo|quent Cicero declaims but coldly on liberty, while in the impetuous Brutus may be perceived a man, who is re|&s;olved to purcha&s;e it with his life. We know little of Plutarch; yet there is a &s;pirit of hone&s;ty and per&s;ua&s;ion in his works, which expre&s;&s;es a philo&s;ophical character, that is not alone capable
<PB N="11" REF="33">
of admiring, but of imitating the vir|tues he records. Why is Addi&s;on &s;till the fir&s;t of our e&s;&s;ayi&s;ts? he has &s;ome|times been excelled in critici&s;ms more philo&s;ophical, in topics more intere&s;t|ing, and in diction more coloured. But there is a pathetic charm in the character he has a&s;&s;umed, in his peri|odical Mi&s;cellanies, which is felt with &s;uch a gentle force, that we &s;carce advert to it. He has painted forth his little humours, his individual feelings, and eterni&s;ed him&s;elf to his readers. John&s;on and Hawke&s;worth we receive with re&s;pect, and we di&s;mi&s;s with awe; we come from their writings as from public lectures, and from Addi|&s;on's as from private conver&s;ations.</P>
<P>Sterne perhaps derives a portion of his celebrity from the &s;ame influence; he intere&s;ts us in his minute&s;t motions, for he tells us all he feels. Richard&s;on was &s;en&s;ible of the power with which the&s;e minute &s;trokes of de&s;cription
<PB N="12" REF="34">
enter the heart, and which are &s;o many fa&s;tenings to which the imagi|nation clings. He &s;ays <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If I give &s;peeches and conver&s;ations I ought to give them ju&s;tly; for the humours and characters of per&s;ons cannot be known, unle&s;s I repeat <HI>what</HI> they &s;ay, and their <HI>manner</HI> of &s;aying."</Q> I con|fe&s;s I am infinitely plea&s;ed when Sir William Temple acquaints us with the &s;ize of his orange trees, and with the flavour of his peaches and grapes, con|fe&s;&s;ed by Frenchmen to equal tho&s;e of France; with his having had the honour to naturalize in this country four kinds of grapes, with his liberal di&s;tribution of them becau&s;e <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he ever thought all things of this kind the commoner they are the better."</Q> In a word with his pa&s;&s;ionate attachment to his gar|den, of his de&s;ire to e&s;cape from great employments, and having pa&s;t five years without going to town, where, by the way, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he had a large hou&s;e

always ready to receive him."</Q> Dry|den has inter&s;per&s;ed many of the&s;e little particulars in his pro&s;aic compo|&s;itions, and I think, that his character and di&s;po&s;itions, may be more correctly acquired by uniting the&s;e &s;cattered no|tices, than by any biographical ac|count which can now be given of this man of genius.</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t now reject this plea&s;ing egoti&s;m, that often relates to us all; this vanity, that has often &s;o much &s;implicity; this &s;elf-flattery that has often &s;o much mode&s;ty. As refinement prevails we &s;eek to conceal our&s;elves from too familiar an in&s;pection; &s;impli|city of manners pa&s;&s;es away with &s;im|plicity of &s;tyle. When we write with &s;parkling antithe&s;is, and &s;olemn ca|dences, with elaborate elegancies and &s;tudied graces, an author is little de&s;i|rous of painting him&s;elf in dome&s;tic negligence. Our writings re&s;emble our fa&s;hions, various in their manner,
<PB N="14" REF="36">
but never &s;imple, and our authors, like their fellow-citizens, are vying with each other in pomp and dignity. Hence, the per&s;onal acquaintance of a modern author, is always to his di&s;|advantage; he has publi&s;hed him&s;elf a &s;uperior being; we approach and di&s;|cover the impo&s;ture. The readers of Montaigne, had they met with him, would have felt differently; they would have found a friend complaining like them&s;elves of his infirmities, and &s;mi|ling with them, at the folly of his complaints.</P>
<P>From this agreeable mode of com|po&s;ition, a &s;pecies of Mi&s;cellanies may be di&s;criminated, which, above all others, becomes precious in the collec|tions of a reader of ta&s;te. To the com|po&s;ition of the&s;e little works, which are often di&s;covered in a fugitive &s;tate, their authors are prompted by the fine impul&s;es of genius, derived from the peculiarity of their &s;ituation, or the
<PB N="15" REF="37">
enthu&s;ia&s;m of their prevailing pa&s;&s;ion. Dictated by the heart, or poli&s;hed with the fondne&s;s of delight, the&s;e produc|tions are impre&s;&s;ed by the &s;eductive eloquence of genius, or attach us by the &s;en&s;ibility of ta&s;te. The object thus &s;elected, is no ta&s;k, impo&s;ed on the mind of the writer, for the mere ambition of literature; but is generally a voluntary effu&s;ion, warm with all the &s;en&s;ations of a pathetic writer. In a word they are the compo&s;itions of genius, on a &s;ubject in which it is mo&s;t deeply intere&s;ted; which it revolves on all it's &s;ides, which it paints in all it's tints, and which it fini&s;hes with the &s;ame ardour it began. Among &s;uch works may be placed the exiled Bolingbroke's "Reflections upon Ex|ile," The retired Petrarch and Zim|merman's E&s;&s;ays on "Solitude." The impri&s;oned Boethius's "Con&s;olations of Philo&s;ophy." The oppre&s;&s;ed Pie|rius Valerianus's Catalogue of "Lite|rary
<PB N="16" REF="38">
Calamities." The deformed Hay's E&s;&s;ay on "Deformity." The projecting De Foe's "E&s;&s;ays on Pro|jects."

<P>We may re&s;pect the profound ge|nius of voluminous writers; they are a kind of painters who occupy great room, and fill up, as a &s;atiri&s;t expre&s;&s;es it, <Q REND="inline">"an acre of canva&s;s."</Q> But we mu&s;t prefer tho&s;e delicate pieces which the Graces lay on the altar of ta&s;te. A groupe of Cupids, a Venus emerging from the waves, a P&s;yche or an Aglaia, embelli&s;h the cabinet of the man of ta&s;te, who connects the&s;e little pieces by wreaths of ro&s;es. A Mi&s;cellani&s;t &s;hould imitate two painters; the mo|dern Albano, celebrated for painting the &s;malle&s;t and the mo&s;t beautiful
<PB N="17" REF="39">
figures; and the ancient Parrha&s;ius, who was ever in &s;uch good humour with him&s;elf as to &s;ing at his labours, which happy circum&s;tance, it is &s;up|po&s;ed, imparted &s;o much gaiety to his compo&s;itions.</P>
<P>But however exqui&s;itely the&s;e lit|tle pieces may be formed, there is a race of &s;tudents who fail not to con|temn elegance as frivolity, and in&s;truc|tive knowledge as &s;uperficial erudi|tion. The ponderous &s;cholars have facetiou&s;ly expre&s;&s;ed their contempt by calling the agreeable writers <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"empty bottles."</Q> U&s;bek, the Per&s;ian of Monte&s;quieu, is one of the profound|e&s;t philo&s;ophers; his letters are how|ever but conci&s;e pages. Rochefou|cault and La Bruyere are not &s;uper|ficial ob&s;ervers of human nature, al|though they have only written &s;enten|ces. Of Tacitus it has been finely remarked by Monte&s;quieu, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he abridged every thing becau&s;e he &s;aw
<PB N="18" REF="40">
every thing,"</Q> and I have ever ad|mired the character of Timanthes, the painter, of whom it is recorded that he expre&s;&s;ed more than he painted by an in&s;tructive and comprehen&s;ive re&s;ervedne&s;s.</P>
<P>It &s;hould indeed be the characteri&s;tic of good Mi&s;cellanies, to be multifa|rious and conci&s;e. Montaigne ap|proves of Plutarch and Seneca, be|cau&s;e their loo&s;e papers were &s;uited to his di&s;po&s;itions, and where knowledge is acquired without a tedious &s;tudy. It is, &s;ays he, no great attempt to take one in hand, and I give over at plea|&s;ure, for they have no &s;equel or con|nection. There are writers, as well as readers, who only con&s;ult books for their amu&s;ement; and they alike are &s;en&s;ible, that four things are written and read with greater plea&s;ure, than one, though that one &s;hould be &s;horter than the four. If Literature is only with &s;ome a mere amu&s;ement, I think
<PB N="19" REF="41">
it will not dimini&s;h it's importance in the affairs of human life; and Dryden confe&s;&s;es, though he is plea&s;ed to add to his &s;hame, that he never read any thing but for his plea&s;ure; he might have added, however, that the plea|&s;ures of Literature are the mo&s;t in|&s;tructive plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Montaigne's works have been called by a Cardinal <Q REND="inline">"the Breviary of Idlers."</Q> It is therefore the book of Man; for all Men are Idlers; we have hours which we pa&s;s with lamentation, and which we know are always returning. At tho&s;e moments Mi&s;cellani&s;ts are conformable to all our humours, and often are &s;o congruous to our mental tone, that they illuminate in many a critical moment. We dart along their airy and conci&s;e page, and their lively anecdote, or their profound ob&s;erva|tion are &s;o many inter&s;titial plea&s;ures in our li&s;tle&s;s hours.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="42">
We find, in the&s;e literary miniatures qualities incompatible with more vo|luminous performances. Sometimes a bolder, and &s;ometimes a firmer touch; for they are allowed but a few &s;trokes; and &s;hould not always trace an ele|gant phra&s;e, but grave a forcible &s;enti|ment. They are permitted every kind of ornament, for how can the dimi|nutive plea&s;e unle&s;s it charms by it's fini&s;hed decorations, it's elaborate ni|ceties, and it's exqui&s;ite poli&s;h? A con|ci&s;e work pre&s;erves a common &s;ubject from in&s;ipidity, and an uncommon one from error. An e&s;&s;ayi&s;t expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf with a more real enthu&s;ia&s;m, than the writer of a volume; for I have ob&s;erved that the mo&s;t fervid genius is apt to cool in a quarto. Race hor&s;es appear only to di&s;play their agile ra|pidity in the cour&s;e, while on the road, they &s;oon become &s;piritle&s;s and tame.</P>
<P>The ancients were great admirers of Mi&s;cellanies; and this with &s;ome pro|found
<PB N="21" REF="43">
&s;tudents who affect to contemn the&s;e light and beautiful compo&s;itions, might be a &s;olid argument to evince their bad ta&s;te. Aulus Gellius has pre&s;erved a copious li&s;t of titles of &s;uch works. The&s;e titles are &s;o numerous and include &s;uch gay and plea&s;ing de|&s;criptions, that we may infer by their number that they were greatly admi|red by the public, and by their titles that they prove the great delight their authors experienced in their compo&s;i|tion. Among the titles are a ba&s;ket of flowers; an embroidered mantle; and a variegated meadow.</P>
<P>The Troubadours, Conteurs, and Jongleurs practi&s;ed what is yet called in the &s;outhern parts of France, <HI>Le guay Saber,</HI> or the gay &s;cience. I con|&s;ider the&s;e as the Mi&s;cellani&s;ts of their day; they had their grave moralities, their tragical hi&s;tories, and their &s;por|tive tales; their ver&s;e and their pro&s;e. The village was in motion at their ap|proach;
<PB N="22" REF="44">
the ca&s;tle was opened to the ambulatory poets, and the feudal hy|pochondriac li&s;tened to their &s;olemn in&s;truction and their airy fancy.

<P>Nature her&s;elf is mo&s;t delightful in her mi&s;cellaneous &s;cenes.

<HEAD>OF PROFESSORS OF ART.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been often &s;aid that a Poet alone &s;hould decide on a Poem, and a Painter on a Picture; but this mu&s;t not be accepted as an incontrovertible maxim. It may be ob&s;erved with great truth, that the Profe&s;&s;ors of an Art, are frequently the mo&s;t incompe|tent judges of a new performance; and that the truth of critici&s;m exi&s;ts no where, but among tho&s;e Men of Ta&s;te, who without a&s;piring to the dangerous glory of being Arti&s;ts, have devoted them&s;elves to a liberal and comprehen&s;ive affection for Art.</P>
<P>Many are the prejudices which vi|tiate the deci&s;ion of an Arti&s;t. The fever of envy will di&s;order the fine&s;t vi&s;ion, and the chillne&s;s of per&s;onal di&s;like will freeze the faculties into a
<PB N="25" REF="47">
fatal torpor. There are local, and there are national prejudices; but al|luding to none of the&s;e obvious cau&s;es, we will con&s;ider an excelling Arti&s;t, as an hone&s;t man, and that he comes to the examination of a new production, with that candour which pardons hu|man imperfections, and with that di&s;|po&s;ition to be plea&s;ed, without which no man can receive plea&s;ure; and with the&s;e favourable propen&s;ities his deci|&s;ion may be unju&s;t.</P>
<P>This defect in the critici&s;ms of Ar|ti&s;ts, has not e&s;caped the animadver|&s;ion of reflecting minds; but is &s;till &s;u&s;ceptible of inve&s;tigation, and forms an important detection in the critical Art. We encounter in the hi&s;tory of literature and ta&s;te, perplexities which embarra&s;s, but which examined will di&s;appear. Arti&s;ts are often arraigned for envy or vanity, when innocent of the pa&s;&s;ions; and Men of Ta&s;te often vacillate in their own ju&s;t notions,
<PB N="26" REF="48">
among the oppo&s;ing &s;entiments of great Arti&s;ts.</P>
<P>Every &s;uperior Arti&s;t addicts him&s;elf to &s;ome peculiar Manner;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some parts of this paragraph have been in&s;erted in an E&s;&s;ay on the Literary Character, p. 116.</NOTE> long loved, long pur&s;ued, and at length obtained, this enamoured object of his pa&s;&s;ion, excludes by it's con&s;tancy every devi|ation from the e&s;tabli&s;hed excellence; to di&s;&s;imilar beauty, he often becomes in&s;en&s;ible, and he forms his compara|tive merit, on any performance, from it's alliance, or it's foreignne&s;s, to his favourite manner. Without recurring to the degrading pa&s;&s;ions, we may thus account for the very oppo&s;ite and erroneous opinions of great Arti&s;ts, on their different labours. It is not pro|bable that Milton envied the genius of Dryden, when he contemptuou&s;ly called him a Rhimer; but it is more evident that Milton's ideas of poetry were not congenial to the manner of
<PB N="27" REF="49">
Dryden. I &s;hall place here &s;ome in|&s;tances which I have remarked. The witty Cowley de&s;pi&s;ed the natural Chaucer; the cla&s;&s;ical Boileau the rough &s;ublimity of Crebillon; the for|cible Corneille the tender Racine; the refined Marivaux the familiar Moliere; the artificial Gray the &s;imple Shen|&s;tone; and the plain and unadorned Montaigne the rich and eloquent Ci|cero. Each en&s;laved to his peculiar manner, was incapable of viewing the diver&s;ifications of beauty, but attached him&s;elf to a partial and endeared por|tion.</P>
<P>Whenever an uncommon &s;pecies of compo&s;ition appears, which di&s;plays a new mode of excellence, and places a new model in the &s;chool of ta&s;te, the &s;lowe&s;t and the la&s;t, to chaunt their peans to that Arti&s;t, will be Arti&s;ts them&s;elves. To envy this cannot al|ways be attributed, but will be gene|rally derived from a want of the pro|per
<PB N="28" REF="50">
ta&s;te for that manner, which ta&s;te can only be gradually formed. One rea&s;on, perhaps, why Arti&s;ts &s;ome|times are inimical to a foreign excel|lence may be attributed to what the French denominate la jalou&s;ie de me|tier, the jealou&s;y of trade; becau&s;e every novel manner is a kind of ho&s;ti|lity again&s;t tho&s;e already e&s;tabli&s;hed. But &s;ome Arti&s;ts are not always in|fluenced by this prejudice, and yet are equally inimical to the new pro|duction.</P>
<P>Of our own times, we may refer to two poets, who it cannot be denied, have created an original manner, and at their fir&s;t appearance in public, ap|pear to have met a &s;imilar fate among Arti&s;ts. When Gray's Odes were pub|li&s;hed, they delighted two men of poetical ta&s;te,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Warburton and Garrick.</NOTE> while they were ridi|culed by two men of poetical genius.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Colman and Lloyd.</NOTE> At a &s;till later period, Churchill ani|madverted
<PB N="29" REF="51">
with &s;everity on the poetry of Gray; and Gold&s;mith and John&s;on were as inimical to that manner as Churchill him&s;elf, though by no means admirers of the genius of Churchill. That manner has now become fixed, and is ju&s;tly appreciated by men of ta&s;te. Far from applauding the &s;ub|jects of Peter Pindar, we mu&s;t admire a copiou&s;ne&s;s of imagery, and a faci|lity of wit, which variegate his early productions with a con&s;tant variety. At their fir&s;t appearance the critics received them with a &s;toical apathy. The per&s;onality of &s;atire alone enabled them to e&s;cape the menaced oblivion. The manner once e&s;tabli&s;hed, the ta&s;te became formed; and critics now give copious panegyrics of performances, which formerly were placed in the ob|&s;cure&s;t parts of the records of litera|ture. In neither of the&s;e in&s;tances can the critics be ju&s;tly cen&s;ured; but it may confirm the judicious ob&s;ervation
<PB N="30" REF="52">
of John&s;on, that after all the refine|ments of critici&s;m, the &s;inal deci&s;ion mu&s;t be left to common readers unper|verted by literary prejudices.</P>
<P>The &s;ame error frequently induces an Arti&s;t, when he contra&s;ts his la|bours with another, to con&s;ider him|&s;elf as the &s;uperior, and of cour&s;e to be &s;tigmatized with the mo&s;t unrea|&s;onable vanity. I &s;hall exemplify the ob&s;ervation by the character of Gold|&s;mith; and it may then appear that that plea&s;ing writer might have con|tra&s;ted his powers with tho&s;e of John|&s;on, and without any perver&s;ion of in|tellect, or inflation of vanity, might according to his own ideas have con|&s;idered him&s;elf, as not inferior to his more celebrated and learned rival.</P>
<P>Gold&s;mith might have preferred the felicity of his own genius, which like a native &s;tream flowed from a natu|ral &s;ource to the elaborate powers of John&s;on, which in &s;ome re&s;pect may
<PB N="31" REF="53">
be compared to tho&s;e artificial waters which throw their &s;parkling currents in the air, to fall into marble ba&s;ons. He might have con&s;idered that he had embelli&s;hed philo&s;ophy with poetical elegance, and have preferred the paintings of his de&s;criptions, to the ter&s;e ver&s;ification and the pointed &s;en|tences of John&s;on. He might have been more plea&s;ed with the faithful repre&s;entations of Engli&s;h manners in his Vicar of Wakefield, than with the borrowed grandeur, and the exotic fancy of the oriental Ra&s;&s;elas. He might have believed, what many ex|cellent critics have believed, that in this age comedy requires more ge|nius than tragedy, and with his au|dience he might have infinitely more e&s;teemed his own original humour, than John&s;on's turgid declamation.

No one might be more &s;en&s;ible than him&s;elf, that he, according to the happy expre&s;&s;ion of John&s;on (when his rival was in the grave) <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"tetigit et ornavit"</Q> Gold&s;mith therefore with|out any &s;ingular vanity, might have concluded from his own rea&s;onings, that he was not an inferior writer to John&s;on; all this not having been con&s;idered, he has come down to po&s;|terity as the vaine&s;t and the mo&s;t jea|lous of writers; he who&s;e di&s;po&s;itions were the mo&s;t inoffen&s;ive, who&s;e bene|volence was the mo&s;t exten&s;ive, and who&s;e amiablene&s;s of heart, has been concealed by it's artle&s;&s;ne&s;s, and pa&s;&s;ed over in the &s;arca&s;ms and &s;neers of a more eloquent rival, and his &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ive

partizans. This character of Gold|&s;mith may however explain that &s;pe|cies of critical compari&s;on which one great writer makes of his manner, with that of a rival.</P>
<P>We can hardly cen&s;ure Arti&s;ts for this attachment to their favourite ex|cellence. Who, but an Arti&s;t, can value the cea&s;ele&s;s inquietudes of ar|duous perfection; can trace the re|mote po&s;&s;ibilities combined in a clo&s;e union; the happy arrangement and the novel variation? he not only is af|fected by the performance like the man of ta&s;te, but is influenced by a peculiar &s;en&s;ation, for while he con|templates the apparent beauties, he often traces in his own mind tho&s;e in|vi&s;ible corrections, by which the final beauty was accompli&s;hed; it is the practical hand alone that is ver&s;ed in, and the eye of genius alone that can di&s;criminate many daring felicities, many concealments of art, and many
<PB N="34" REF="58">
difficulties overcome. Hence, it is ob&s;erved, that Arti&s;ts do not always prefer tho&s;e effects which influence an unprejudiced, and uncorrupted ta&s;te; but rather tho&s;e refinements which form the &s;ecret exultation of Art; and the minuter excellencies which con&s;i&s;t in the mechanical (as a critic of ta&s;te terms it) are often preferred to tho&s;e more elevated ones which ari&s;e from the ideal. It is this indulgence for the refinements, which at length termi|nate in corrupting Art.</P>
<P>But a partiality for &s;electing one branch of Art in preference to another, is perhaps the only a&s;cent to it's &s;um|mit. We mu&s;t not therefore calum|niate Arti&s;ts, if they neglect the vari|ous &s;chools of beauty. It is not diffi|cult for a man of ta&s;te who&s;e hand repo&s;es, while his head ever thinks; who&s;e creative powers are quie&s;cent, but who&s;e perceptive faculties are ha|bitually invigorated; and who in the
<PB N="35" REF="59">
tranquillity of his cabinet, has only to gaze at pictures, but not to blend co|lours, and to meditate on poems, but not to compo&s;e ver&s;es; it is not diffi|cult for this elegant idler to form the mo&s;t various views of beauty in Art; to trace with the &s;ame lively gratifica|tion it's diver&s;ities, and to feel no di&s;|plea&s;ure from the mo&s;t incongruous manners. Such an one, may be &s;up|po&s;ed to hover with exta&s;y round the ideal of a Raphael, and a Pope, or to mix with the grote&s;que caricatures of a Hogarth or a Butler. This ver&s;ati|lity of ta&s;te is generally denied to the man of genius; and while men of ta&s;te, are often unanimous in their opinions, we &s;hall frequently ob&s;erve, that the greate&s;t Arti&s;ts give the mo&s;t di&s;cordant deci&s;ions. John&s;on &s;aid that his notions on MSS. proved gene|rally erroneous; and this circum&s;tance has happened to many eminent writers.</P>

<HEAD>ON STYLE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Hi&s;tory of Engli&s;h Style &s;ince it's fir&s;t elegance may, perhaps, be traced in the following conci&s;e manner.</P>
<P>When the national literature has at|tained to a certain point, there ari&s;es a &s;imple elegance of Style, which in it's progre&s;s di&s;plays richer ornaments, and often becomes refined to a vicious exce&s;s. It may be traced through four &s;chools.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t writers who attempt ele|gance, and poli&s;h the a&s;perities of a language, excel in a natural &s;weetne&s;s and amiable &s;implicity. But the Style is not yet ca&s;tigated, for it &s;till retains many colloquial terms and many neg|ligent expre&s;&s;ions, which either were not &s;uch in their day, or their ear, not being yet accu&s;tomed to a continued
<PB N="38" REF="62">
elegance, received no pain from fami|liar and un&s;tudied expre&s;&s;ions. In time the&s;e defects become &s;en&s;ible; yet as the&s;e writers are placed among the fir&s;t cla&s;&s;ics of their nation, they are regarded with veneration, and often pointed out as the model for young writers. Among &s;uch authors we may place Tillot&s;on, Swift, and Addi&s;on.</P>
<P>The &s;econd &s;chool introduces a more diffu&s;e and verbo&s;e manner; the&s;e wri|ters &s;olicit the ear by a numerous pro&s;e, and expand their ideas on a glittering &s;urface. As elegance can only be obtained by diffu&s;ion, it's concomitant is feeblene&s;s, and an elegant writer enervates his &s;entiments. Beauty is incon&s;i&s;tent with Force. Elevated emo|tions the&s;e writers rarely awaken, but a graceful manner in compo&s;ition is their peculiar charm. Genius may be &s;uppo&s;ed at this period, to be &s;ome|what impaired by the excur&s;ions of their predece&s;&s;ors, and they attempt
<PB N="39" REF="63">
to &s;upply by the charms of amenity, and a copious diffu&s;ion of beautiful ex|pre&s;&s;ion, the demand for novelty, as well as that ta&s;te for elegance of dic|tion which the public now po&s;&s;e&s;s. Among the&s;e plea&s;ing writers may be ranked Sir William Temple, though prior to Addi&s;on, U&s;her, Melmoth, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Satiated with the nervele&s;s beauty and the protracted period, a third &s;chool appears, the votaries of artifi|cial embelli&s;hment and elaborated dic|tion. At once, magi&s;terially pompous, and familiarly pointed; conci&s;e and &s;welling; &s;parkling and &s;olid; ma&s;&s;y and light. Sometimes they conden&s;e ideas, by throwing into one va&s;t thought, &s;everal intermediate ones; &s;ometimes their rotundity of period is &s;o arranged that the mind, with the ear, &s;eems to ri&s;e on a regular a&s;cent. The glare of art betrays it&s;elf; while &s;ometimes the thoughts are more &s;ubtile than &s;ub|&s;tantial, more airy than penetrating;
<PB N="40" REF="64">
the expre&s;&s;ions new, and the ideas old. This &s;chool abounds with man|neri&s;ts; &s;uch are John&s;on, Hawke&s;|worth, Robert&s;on, and Gibbon.</P>
<P>When this ta&s;te for ornamented pro&s;e prevails, a fourth &s;chool ari&s;es, compo&s;ed of inferior writers. As it is le&s;s difficult to collect words, than to create ideas, this race becomes ver|&s;ed in all the my&s;teries of diction; tri|vial thoughts are ridiculou&s;ly inve&s;ted by magnificent expre&s;&s;ions, and they con&s;ider that blending the mo&s;t glaring colours, without harmony or de&s;ign, is an evidence of higher art. They colour like the di&s;tracted painter in Bedlam, who delighted in land&s;capes of golden earths, and vermilion &s;kies. They tell us that their colours are vi|vid, and we reply that their figures are chimeras. The&s;e fanta&s;tic novelties flouri&s;h in the warmth of a fa&s;hionable circle, but once placed in the open air, they are killed by the popular gale.
<PB N="41" REF="65">
Writers of this cla&s;s are not to be mentioned, as they are all dead au|thors who are yet living.</P>
<P>We may here ob&s;erve that every pe|riod of literature has it's peculiar Style, derived from &s;ome author of reputa|tion; and the hi&s;tory of a language as an object of ta&s;te, might be traced through a collection of ample quota|tions, from the mo&s;t celebrated authors of each period. We &s;hould as rarely find an original Style, as an original Genius; and we &s;hould be enabled to perceive the almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible varia|tions which at length produce an ori|ginal Style.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t advert to the opinions of the public, during this progre&s;s of Style. Tho&s;e who have long been at|tached to the fir&s;t &s;chool of natural ele|gance, with all it's imperfections, re|volt from the o&s;tentatious opulence of the third; and are more inclined to favour the &s;econd. The third &s;chool
<PB N="42" REF="66">
is however the mo&s;t popular, for the public has greater refinement, than in the preceding periods.</P>
<P>Some di&s;tingui&s;h between ta&s;te and refinement; this di&s;tinction is not very obvious. Refinement is only a &s;upe|rior ta&s;te, according to tho&s;e, who are fond of an embelli&s;hed diction; but it is con&s;idered as a vicious ta&s;te, by the advocates for &s;implicity of lan|guage. They differ in their accepta|tion of the term, and the former there|fore &s;mile, when the latter cen&s;ure re|finement of diction.</P>
<P>Refinement in Style, is of no remote date. The pro&s;e of Pope is nearly as refined as his ver&s;e; and this ta&s;te he appears to have borrowed from &s;ome of the French writers, particularly from Fontenelle, who&s;e reputation was then very high, and who has carried the <HI>bel e&s;prit,</HI> to it's fine&s;t exce&s;s. By the <HI>bel e&s;prit,</HI> I mean, a manner of writing which di&s;plays unexpected turns of
<PB N="43" REF="67">
thought; the art of half concealing a &s;entiment that the reader may have the plea&s;ure of gue&s;&s;ing it; brilliant allu&s;ions, epigrammatic points, and de|licate &s;trokes. A mode of writing as dangerous, as it is plea&s;ing; yet adapt|ed to conci&s;e compo&s;itions. No pro|&s;aic writer, in Pope's day, approached his refinement; the be&s;t writers then, and for &s;ome time after, compo&s;ed with colloquial barbari&s;ms and feeble expre&s;&s;ions. Steele, Tillot&s;on, and others, have written, with carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and laxity; Addi&s;on and Dryden de|light by an agreeablene&s;s of manner, which no where accompanied the works of their cotemporaries; their &s;uperior genius &s;eems to have given colour and form to their yet unformed and uncoloured language. When Ad|di&s;on de&s;cribes the powers of beauty, the &s;uavity, the grace and the melli|fluence give a new idea of our lan|guage, and Dryden has a mellow rich|ne&s;s,
<PB N="44" REF="68">
an enchanting negligence, and a facility of ideas. They alike threw into their Style a gaiety of fancy, which is equivalent to all the charms of re|fined expre&s;&s;ions. They alone of all the writers of their age, have &s;ecured the admiration of po&s;terity; and will not be injured by any novel mode of language; for to real genius they uni|ted tho&s;e &s;ubordinate graces which are imperi&s;hable. To John&s;on may be at|tributed the e&s;tabli&s;hment of our pre|&s;ent refinement; and it is with truth he ob&s;erves of his Rambler, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that he had laboured to refine our language to grammatical purity, and to clear it from colloquial barbari&s;ms, licen|tious idioms, and irregular combina|tions, and that he has added to the elegance of it's con&s;truction and to the harmony of it's cadence."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Great inelegance of diction di&s;graced our lan|guage even &s;o late as in 1736, when the enquiry into the Life of Homer was publi&s;hed. That author was certainly de&s;irous of all the graces of compo&s;ition, and his volume by it's &s;ingular &s;culptures evinces his in|ordinate affectation. This fanciful writer had a ta&s;te for poli&s;hed writing. Yet he abounds in expre&s;|&s;ions which now would be con&s;idered as criminal in literary compo&s;ition. Such vulgari&s;ms are common&mdash;the Greeks <HI>fell to their old trade</HI> of one tribe's expell|ing another&mdash;the &s;cene is always at Athens, and all the <HI>pother</HI> is &s;ome little jilting &s;tory&mdash;the haughty Roman &s;nuffed at the &s;upplene&s;s.

refinement in Style, John&s;on appears partly to have borrowed from the mo&s;t elegant French writers, who&s;e beauties he has &s;ometimes tran&s;po&s;ed and fre|quently imitated, as Gibbon has more apparently done. All the refinements of Style exi&s;t among that refining peo|ple, and the Lectures of Blair are often judicious repetitions of what may be found in their critics, or happy ex|amples which are drawn from their writers.</P>
<P>Refinement in Style, with many, in|cludes in the very expre&s;&s;ion, a cen|&s;ureable quality in compo&s;ition. But this critici&s;m is unju&s;t; refinement may indeed be vicious, as &s;implicity may
<PB N="46" REF="70">
it&s;elf be; refinement is not le&s;s offen|&s;ive to a reader of ta&s;te, when it ri&s;es into affectation, than &s;implicity &s;inking into in&s;ipidity. But we mu&s;t not con|found refinement of Style, with it's puerile exce&s;s; nor is it ju&s;t to cen&s;ure refinement becau&s;e it differs from &s;im|plicity. Some perhaps will agree, that a writer cannot refine too much, pro|vided he flies not too remotely in &s;earch of it's ornaments; for that which <HI>ar|ti&s;tly</HI> employed, throws a new light, and gives a more agreeable po&s;ition to an object, cannot be cen&s;ured but by tho&s;e who&s;e organs are indifferent.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the&s;e complications of ta&s;te &s;ome argue in favour of a natural Style, and reiterate the opinion of many great critics, that proper ideas will be ac|companied by proper words. But this ob&s;ervation, though &s;upported by the fir&s;t authorities, is not perhaps &s;uffici|ently clear. Writers may think ju&s;tly, and write offen&s;ively; and a plea&s;ing
<PB N="47" REF="71">
Style may convey a vacuity of thought. Does not this evident fact prove that Style and Thinking have not that in&s;e|parable connection which many great writers have pronounced? Writing is ju&s;tly called an Art; and Rou&s;&s;eau, &s;ays, it is not an art ea&s;ily acquired. Thinking may be the foundation of Style; but it is not the &s;uper&s;tructure; it is not the ornaments. The art of pre&s;enting our thoughts to another, is often a proce&s;s of con&s;iderable time and labour; and the delicate ta&s;k of correction, re&s;erved only for writers of fine ta&s;te, proves, that there are &s;eve|ral modes of pre&s;enting an idea; vul|gar readers are only &s;u&s;ceptible of the rough and palpable &s;troke; but there are many &s;hades of &s;entiment, which to &s;eize on and to paint, is the pride and the labour of a fine writer.</P>
<P>In the third &s;chool we ob&s;erve, a race of writers who are called MAN|NERISTS in Style. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed
<PB N="48" REF="72">
that &s;uch writers however great their powers, rather excite the admiration, than the affection of a man of ta&s;te; becau&s;e their habitual art, di&s;&s;ipates that illu&s;ion of &s;incerity, which we love to believe is the impul&s;e, which places the pen in the hand of an au|thor. Two eminent literary Manner|i&s;ts are Cicero and John&s;on. We know the&s;e great men con&s;idered their elo|quence as a deceptive art;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;ophi&s;try of John&s;on in conver&s;ation appears to have been his favourite amu&s;ement; but Cicero is more cen&s;ureable, &s;ince in the mo&s;t &s;olemn acts of life, and before the tribunal of ju&s;tice, he confe&s;&s;es to have protected and &s;aved the life of many a criminal, by the power of his eloquence. This indeed will be con&s;idered as no crime at We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall, where, without his eloquence, they &s;hare his guilt. Plu|tarch gives one anecdote relative to the orator's ex|ultation. He &s;aid to Munatius&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Do&s;t thou think thou wa&s;t acquitted for thy own &s;ake, and not be|cau&s;e I threw a veil over thy manife&s;t crimes, &s;o that the court could not perceive thy guilt?"</Q></NOTE> of any &s;ubject it had been indifferent to them which &s;ide to adopt; and in reading their elaborate works, our ear is more frequently gratified by the ambitious magnificence of their diction, than our

heart penetrated by the pathetic en|thu&s;ia&s;m of their &s;entiments. Writers who are not Manneri&s;ts, but who &s;eize the appropriate tone of their &s;ubject, appear to feel a conviction of what they attempt to per&s;uade their reader. It is ob&s;ervable, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to imitate with uniform felicity the noble &s;implicity of a pathetic writer; while the peculiarities of a Manneri&s;t, are &s;o far from being difficult, that they are di&s;played with nice exactne&s;s by mid|ling writers, who although their own natural manner had nothing intere&s;t|ing, have attracted notice by &s;uch imi|tations. We may apply to &s;ome mo|notonous Manneri&s;ts the&s;e ver&s;es of Boileau.

It may, perhaps, &s;urpri&s;e &s;ome, that among the literary refinements of the pre&s;ent age, may be counted above forty different Styles, as appear by a Rhetorical Dictionary. The facility of acquiring a Style produces our nume|rous authors; and hence we abound with writers, but have few thinkers. A Style deficient in thinking cannot form a perfect compo&s;ition; for we may compare STYLE to the MECHANIC or executive part of painting; while THINKING is the FINE IDEAL or in|ventive. And this di&s;tinction, if ju&s;t, will &s;ettle a que&s;tion long agitated, whether there is any di&s;tinction be|tween Style and Thinking. Raphael, who excelled in the ideal, was not &s;o perfect in &s;ome part of the mechanic, as Titian; and, we might venture to &s;ay, that John&s;on, who excelled in the mechanic, did not equal the ideal of Addi&s;on.</P>

Mr. Webb, an advocate for &s;impli|city, has two lines on the Style of Hooker, the la&s;t of which has great felicity of conception. 
<Q><L>"Thy language is cha&s;te, without aims or pretence;</L>
<L>"'Tis a &s;weetne&s;s of breath, from a &s;oundne&s;s of &s;en&s;e."</L></Q>
He accompanies them by a note, in which he cen&s;ures refinement, as a &s;tudied advantage in the manner, inde|pendent on an adequate motive in the thought. Mr. Alli&s;on would con&s;ider every compo&s;ition as faulty and defec|tive in which the expre&s;&s;ion of the art is more &s;triking than the expre&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubject, or in which the beauty of de&s;ign prevails over the beauty of cha|racter or expre&s;&s;ion. I &s;hall add the ob&s;ervation of a friend, who has often delighted the public, that he would not have the Style withdraw the atten|tion from the Thought.</P>
<P>I mean not to oppo&s;e the opinions of the warm admirers of &s;implicity.
<PB N="52" REF="76">
A beautiful &s;implicity it&s;elf is a &s;pecies of refinement; and no writer more &s;olicitou&s;ly corrected his works than Hume, who excels in this mode of compo&s;ition. But is it not an evident error in men of ta&s;te to form a predi|lection for any peculiar Style; &s;ince all the intermediate &s;pecies of diction be|tween &s;implicity and refinement are equally beautiful, when they form, the appropriate tone of the &s;ubject? We often enquire if an author's Style is beautiful or &s;ublime; we &s;hould rather de&s;ire to know whether it was proper. The&s;e varieties of diction, which the advocates for &s;implicity con&s;ider as &s;o many aberrations from rectitude of thinking, form on the contrary the very exi&s;tence of ju&s;t thought. Sim|plicity, however pure, can never cau&s;e the &s;trong emotions of an ornamented diction; an ornamented diction can never give the rapid and lively graces of gaiety; nor can a rapid Style em|belli&s;h
<PB N="53" REF="77">
flowery and brilliant concep|tions. Every Style is excellent, if it be proper, and that Style is mo&s;t proper which can be&s;t convey the intentions of the author to his reader.</P>
<P>There appears in every Style, a cer|tain point, beyond which, or which not attained, it is defective. The &s;im|plicity of the fir&s;t &s;chool degenerates into frigidity and vapidne&s;s; the beauty of the &s;econd protracts into languor and tediou&s;ne&s;s; and the grandeur of the third &s;wells into turgidity and va|cuity. But though this point may be difficult to de&s;cribe, a fine <HI>tact</HI> long practi&s;ed, in&s;tantaneou&s;ly di&s;covers it. We &s;oon decide on the Style of an author, but not on his thoughts; and we often find, that the one may be ex|cellent, while the other has nothing uncommon.</P>
<P>Hume, who has all the refinement of &s;implicity, highly approves of Ad|di&s;on's definition of fine writing, who
<PB N="54" REF="78">
&s;ays, that it con&s;i&s;ts of &s;entiments which are natural, without being ob|vious. This is &s;urely no definition of fine writing, but of fine thinking. The elegant author has omitted the magical graces of diction; the modu|lation of harmonious cadences, the art of expre&s;&s;ing, with delicacy, delicate ideas, and painting &s;ublime concep|tions in the magnificence of language. In my opinion Shen&s;tone has a&s;cer|tained the truth; for fine writing he de|fines to be generally the effect of &s;pon|taneous thoughts and a laboured Style. Addi&s;on was not in&s;en&s;ible to the&s;e charms, and he felt the &s;eductive art of Cicero when he &s;aid, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"there is as much difference in apprehend|ing a thought clothed in Cicero's language, and that of a common au|thor, as in &s;eeing an object by the light of a taper, or by the light of the &s;un."</Q> This is not le&s;s true, than finely expre&s;&s;ed; and what &s;hews Style
<PB N="55" REF="79">
to be independent of thinking, is, that even common thoughts are found to give plea&s;ure when adorned by ex|pre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t therefore di&s;&s;ent from the ad|mired definition of Addi&s;on, becau&s;e it does not define it's object. In this age of ta&s;te, or refinement, if you plea&s;e, a compo&s;ition which &s;hould alone con&s;i&s;t of natural, yet not obvi|ous, &s;entiments, would fail to attract, unadorned by the felicities of diction. But I &s;hall be told by &s;ome, that our pre&s;ent ta&s;te, which I am here placing as the criterion of compo&s;ition, is what they preci&s;ely arraign. I mu&s;t reply, that it is what I applaud. Sim|plicity may be too obvious, and re|finement too obtru&s;ive; whatever is obvious di&s;gu&s;ts; whatever is obtru|&s;ive offends. We may apply to Style in general, the beautiful de&s;cription which Milton gives of Eve pre&s;enting her&s;elf to Adam,
<Q><L>"Not OBVIOUS, not OBTRUSIVE &s;he."</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="80">
It appears that the advocates for &s;implicity of Style are not &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible to the varieties of diction. What, would they think, if we &s;hould venture to &s;ay, that Style may have a marvellous influence over the human mind? Longinus makes a mu&s;ical ar|rangement of words a part of the &s;ub|lime, and he adds, that many have ac|quired the reputation of fine writers, who&s;e chief merit con&s;i&s;ted in the charm of their periods. This ob&s;erva|tion every man of ta&s;te knows to be ju&s;t. We have writers, who, without exhibiting much vigour of conception, or energy of genius, delight by a ma|gical delicacy. An eloquent Style has a pathetic influence on the mind. Men of ta&s;te, who are unbia&s;&s;ed by any particular Style, can alone be &s;en|&s;ible to it's fine&s;t &s;trokes, and are often in raptures, when others are in&s;en|&s;ible. The practi&s;ed eye in painting &s;ees pictures the uninitiated can never

<P>After all, it is Style alone by which po&s;terity will judge of a great work, for an author can have nothing truly his own but his Style; facts, &s;cientific di&s;coveries, and every kind of infor|mation may be &s;eized by all, but an author's diction cannot be taken from him. Hence very learned writers have been neglected, while their learning has not been lo&s;t to the world, by hav|ing been given by finer writers.

<HEAD>HISTORICAL CHARACTERS ARE FALSE REPRESENTATIONS <HI>of</HI> NATURE.</HEAD>
<P>WE accu&s;tom our&s;elves to pay too liberal an admiration to the great Cha|racters recorded in modern, to &s;ay nothing of ancient, Hi&s;tory. It &s;eems often nece&s;&s;ary to be reminded that the mo&s;t intere&s;ting hi&s;tory, is generally the mo&s;t elegantly written, and that whatever is adorned by elegance, is the compo&s;ition of art. Charmed and &s;educed by the variegated tints of ima|gination, the &s;cene is heightened, and the objects move into life; but while we yield our&s;elves to the captivating talent of the arti&s;t, we forget that the whole repre&s;entation is but a picture, and that painters like poets, are in|dulged with a certain agreeable licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s. Hence we form fal&s;e e&s;ti|mates
<PB N="60" REF="84">
of the human character, and while we exhau&s;t our &s;en&s;ations in ar|tificial &s;ympathies, amid&s;t characters and circum&s;tances almo&s;t fictitious, for the natural events and the natural calamities of life, we &s;uppre&s;s tho&s;e warmer emotions we otherwi&s;e &s;hould indulge. The human character ap|pears diminutive when compared with tho&s;e we meet with in hi&s;tory; yet, am I per&s;uaded, that dome&s;tic &s;orrows are not le&s;s poignant, and many of our a&s;|&s;ociates are characters not inferior to the elaborate delineations which &s;o much intere&s;t in the deceptive page of hi&s;tory. The hi&s;torian is a &s;culptor, who though he di&s;plays a correct &s;em|blance of nature, is not le&s;s &s;olicitous of di&s;playing the miracles of his art, and therefore enlarges his figures to a colo&s;&s;al dimen&s;ion.</P>
<P>The ancient hi&s;torians compiled pro|digies, to gratify the credulous curio|&s;ity of their readers; but &s;ince prodi|gies
<PB N="61" REF="85">
have cea&s;ed, while the &s;ame avi|dity for the marvellous exi&s;ts, modern hi&s;torians have transferred the miracu|lous to their per&s;onages. Children read fables as hi&s;tories, but the philo|&s;opher reads hi&s;tories as fables. Fa|bulous narratives may however convey much in&s;truction.</P>
<P>It is the plea&s;ing labour of genius to amplify into va&s;tne&s;s, to colour into beauty, and to arrange the objects which occupy his meditations, with a &s;ecret artifice of di&s;po&s;ition. I think Voltaire in one of his Letters has let us into the my&s;tery of the hi&s;torical art; for he there tells us, that no wri|ters, but tho&s;e who have compo&s;ed tragedies, can throw any intere&s;t into a hi&s;tory; that we mu&s;t know to paint and excite the pa&s;&s;ions; and that a hi&s;tory, like a dramatic piece, mu&s;t have &s;ituation, intrigue, and cata&s;tro|phe. An ob&s;ervation which has great truth, but which &s;hews that there can
<PB N="62" REF="86">
be but little truth in &s;uch agreeable narratives. Every hi&s;torian communi|cates his character to his hi&s;tory; if he is profound and politic, his &s;tate&s;|men re&s;emble political deities, who&s;e lea&s;t motion is a &s;tratagem, and who&s;e plot contains the &s;eeds of many plots. If he is a writer, more elegant than profound, he delights in de&s;criptive grandeur; in the touching narratives of &s;uffering beauty, and per&s;ecuted virtue. If he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a romantic turn, his heroes are &s;o many Arthurs, and the actions he records, put a mode&s;t adventurer into de&s;pair. No writers more than the hi&s;torian, and the pro|fe&s;&s;ed Romancer, &s;o &s;edulou&s;ly prac|tice the artifice of awakening curio|&s;ity, and fea&s;ting that appetency of the mind, which turns from whole&s;ome truth, to &s;pirited fiction. We love not what we are, becau&s;e it wants the grace of novelty; we are plea&s;ed with the wanderings of fancy, becau&s;e they
<PB N="63" REF="87">
&s;hoot far above the &s;ober limit of na|ture; we &s;carce glance at the glitter|ing of a &s;tar, but we gaze with delight on the corru&s;cations of a meteor. We therefore &s;uffer our&s;elves to become intere&s;ted with tho&s;e objects which &s;hould intere&s;t us lea&s;t.</P>
<P>The hi&s;torian &s;ei&s;ing this inclination of the mind, delights it with that imaginary force, and fanta&s;tic gran|deur, of which, while plea&s;ed with the emotions, we perceive not the ex|travagance. Popular prejudice a&s;&s;i&s;ts the illu&s;ion, and becau&s;e we are ac|cu&s;tomed to behold public characters occupy a &s;ituation in life, that few can experience, we are induced to believe that their capacities are more enlarg|ed, their pa&s;&s;ions more refined, and in a word, that nature has be&s;towed on them faculties, denied to ob&s;curer men. But who, acquainted with hu|man nature, he&s;itates to acknowledge, that mo&s;t of the characters in hi&s;tory
<PB N="64" REF="88">
were per&s;ons whom accident had &s;eat|ed upon a throne, or placed with le&s;s favour around it? Had Alfred been a private per&s;on, like the Man of Ro&s;s, his various virtues might only accidentally have reached us; and had Richard III. been a citizen of London, he had been led unnoticed to the gibbet.</P>
<P>This pernicious prejudice, which peoples the mind with artificial beings, and enfeebles the &s;ympathies of do|me&s;tic life, will di&s;appear when we come to tho&s;e few facts in hi&s;tory, which the art of the hi&s;torian can no longer di&s;gui&s;e; and which, refu&s;ing the decorations of his fancy, pre&s;ent the &s;ublime per&s;onages of hi&s;tory, in the nudity of truth. Let the monarch lo&s;e his crown, and the mini&s;ter his place; let the ca&s;que fall from the hero, and the cap from the cardinal; it is then, the&s;e important per&s;onages &s;peak in the voice of di&s;tre&s;s, are actu|ated
<PB N="65" REF="89">
by pa&s;&s;ions like our own, and come to us with no other claim on our feelings, than that common &s;en&s;ibility, which we owe to humanity. Here, indeed, the le&s;&s;ons of hi&s;tory, become in&s;tructive, becau&s;e they teach that every other portion of hi&s;tory has re|ceived the romantic gilding of the pen|cil; that the &s;agacity of the &s;tate&s;man is not &s;o adroit, as not to be entangled in it's own nets; that the ardour of the hero is often temerity which e&s;|caped, and &s;ometimes temerity cha&s;|ti&s;ed; and that in general great charac|ters, owe much more to Fortune, than to Nature; that &s;ingular coincidencies have formed &s;ingular events; but, that whenever the delu&s;ion of the hi&s;torian cea&s;es, the&s;e illu&s;trious per&s;ons appear to have been actuated by pa&s;&s;ions &s;imi|lar to our own, and that their talents are not &s;uperior to tho&s;e who&s;e ob|&s;cure actions langui&s;h in a confined &s;phere. It is ob&s;erved, by Monte&s;|quieu,
<PB N="66" REF="90">
that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"mo&s;t legi&s;lators have been men of limited capacities, whom chance placed at the head of others, and who have generally con|&s;ulted merely their prejudices and their fancies."</Q></P>
<P>It is, indeed, u&s;eful to pau&s;e over tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages which give the very feelings of the illu&s;trious per&s;ons to whom they relate, and if to &s;ome, the&s;e may &s;eem to humble the great, they will al&s;o elevate us; or, rather, they will rein&s;tate human nature in that ju&s;t equality in which we are all placed. The phantom of hi&s;tory will vani&s;h, but the human form will re|main palpable and true.</P>
<P>Few circum&s;tances are more curious in hi&s;tory than the unadorned recitals of &s;ome memoirs. I am plea&s;ed with what Thomas Heywood in his "Eng|land's Elizabeth" has noticed rela|tive to the confinement of this Prin|ce&s;s. It is an in&s;tance that one of
<PB N="67" REF="91">
the mo&s;t celebrated characters felt the &s;ame agitation, and expre&s;&s;ed the &s;ame language, which an inferior pri&s;oner would have experienced. This writer gives her meditations in the garden during her impri&s;onment, in which the natural pa&s;&s;ions are not entirely lo&s;t in the di&s;tortion of the language. Du|ring her confinement at Wood&s;tock, hourly dreading a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, &s;he u&s;ed to &s;it at the grate of her pri&s;on window morning and evening, li&s;tening and &s;hedding tears at the light carolling of the pa&s;&s;ing milkmaids. Among other in&s;ults &s;he received in travelling, the high winds having di&s;compo&s;ed her dre&s;s, &s;he de&s;ired to retire to &s;ome hou&s;e to adju&s;t her&s;elf; but this &s;he was refu&s;ed, and was compelled to make her toilette under a hedge! A kindred anecdote is mentioned by Sir Walter Rawlegh, of Charles V. who ju&s;t after his re&s;ignation, having a pri|vate interview with &s;ome amba&s;&s;ador,
<PB N="68" REF="92">
and having prolonged it to a late hour after midnight, called for a &s;ervant to light the amba&s;&s;ador on the &s;tairs; but they had all retired to re&s;t; and the emperor, yet the terror of Europe, was obliged to &s;natch a candle and conduct the amba&s;&s;ador to the door. It is thus that maje&s;ty, unrobed of fac|titious powers, convinces even the &s;low apprehen&s;ion of the vulgar, that the brea&s;t of grandeur only conceals pa&s;&s;ions like their own; and that Eli|zabeth dre&s;&s;ing under a hedge, and Charles lighting the amba&s;&s;ador on the &s;tairs, felt the &s;ame bitter indig|nity, which they are doomed to feel much oftener.</P>
<P>If it were po&s;&s;ible to read the hi&s;to|ries of tho&s;e who are doomed to have no hi&s;torian, and to glance into dome&s;|tic journals, as well as into national archives, we &s;hould then perceive the unju&s;t prodigality of our &s;ympathy to tho&s;e few names, which eloquence
<PB N="69" REF="93">
has adorned with all the &s;eduction of her graces. We &s;hould then acknow|ledge, that &s;uperior talents are not &s;ufficient to obtain &s;uperiority, and that the full tide of opportunity, which often carries away the unworthy in triumph, leaves the worthy among the &s;hoals. It is a curious &s;peculation for ob&s;erving men, to trace great charac|ters in little &s;ituations, and to detect real genius pa&s;&s;ing through life incog|nito. How many mothers of great characters, may addre&s;s their &s;ons in the words of the Mother of Bra&s;idas; he was indeed a great and virtuous commander, but &s;he ob&s;erved <HI>that Sparta had many greater Bra&s;idas.</HI> Some ob&s;cure men, whom the world will ne|ver notice, had they occupied the &s;itua|tion of great per&s;onages, would have been even more illu&s;trious. There are never wanting among a poli&s;hed peo|ple, men of &s;uperior talents or &s;uperior virtues; every great revolution evinces
<PB N="70" REF="94">
this truth; indeed, at that perilous moment, they &s;hew them&s;elves in too great numbers, and become fatal to each other, by their rival abilities.</P>
<P>Robert&s;on, who is &s;o plea&s;ing an hi&s;torian, and therefore, who&s;e vera|city becomes very &s;u&s;picious, confe&s;&s;es, however, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"in judging of the conduct of princes, we are apt to a&s;cribe too much to political mo|tives, and too little to the pa&s;&s;ions which they feel in common with the re&s;t of mankind. In order to ac|count for Elizabeth's pre&s;ent, as well as her &s;ub&s;equent conduct towards Mary, we mu&s;t not always con&s;ider her as a queen, we mu&s;t &s;ometimes regard her merely as a woman."</Q> This is preci&s;ely what the refining in|genuity of this writer does as rarely as any hi&s;torian; and Robert&s;on appears to have been more adapted for a mi|ni&s;ter of &s;tate, than the principal of a Scotch college. He explains projects
<PB N="71" REF="95">
that were unknown, and details &s;tra|tagems which never took place. We often admire the fertile conceptions of the queen regent; of Elizabeth; and of Bothwell; when in truth, we are defrauding Robert&s;on of whatever prai&s;e may be due to political inven|tion.</P>
<P>But we, who, however charmed with hi&s;toric beauty, revere truth and hu|manity, mu&s;t learn to reduce the ag|gravated magnitude of the illu&s;trious dead, that we may perform an act of ju&s;tice to the ob&s;cure living. The &s;ym|pathy we give to a prince&s;s, ravi&s;hed from her throne and dragged by trai|tors, to wet with tears, the iron grates of her dungeon, we may with no le&s;s propriety be&s;tow on that unfortunate female, whom unfeeling creditors have &s;natched from maternal duties, or &s;o|cial labours, to peri&s;h by the hour, in &s;ome loath&s;ome pri&s;on. If we feel for the decapitation of a virtuous and long
<PB N="72" REF="96">
per&s;ecuted &s;tate&s;man, we are not to feel le&s;s for that more common object, a man of genius, condemned to lan|gui&s;h in ob&s;curity, and peri&s;h in de|&s;pair. A great general dies in the embrace of victory, and his character reaches po&s;terity in immortal language; but he probably conducted hundreds whom nature intended for generals, but whom fortune made foot &s;oldiers: what heroes may be found in ho&s;pi|tals! Katharine, the queen of Henry VIII. is an object of our tendere&s;t &s;ym|pathy, but why &s;hould our &s;en&s;ibility be dimini&s;hed, when we look on tho&s;e numerous females, not le&s;s gentle, nor le&s;s cruelly mi&s;u&s;ed, who, without the con&s;olations of &s;overeignty, are united to de&s;pots, not le&s;s arbitrary and bru|tal than Henry? The &s;orrows of the Scotti&s;h Mary, the refined in&s;ults of a rival &s;i&s;ter, the grin of &s;corn, and the implication of infamy, may penetrate our hearts; but we forget that there
<PB N="73" REF="97">
are families, where &s;cenes not le&s;s ter|rible, and &s;i&s;ters not le&s;s unrelenting, are hourly di&s;covered; and that there are beauties, who without being con|fined to the melancholy magnificence of a ca&s;tle, or led to the di&s;mal honour of an axe, equally fall victims, or to fatal indi&s;cretion, or to fatal per&s;ecu|tion. But he who has filled his mind with the grand &s;trokes of hi&s;torical characters, and who conceives their feelings of a more &s;ubtile texture, may urge, that &s;uch was the &s;en&s;ibility of grief in Mary, that her beautiful tre&s;&s;es had turned grey. Alas! how many are agoni&s;ed by as &s;harp corro&s;ives, yet who know not, as their &s;ighs pa&s;s away unheard, that it is the &s;ettled melancholy of their &s;oul, which has changed their hairs grey! If &s;ome con&s;ider that a queen is more wretch|ed, by contra&s;t of &s;ituation, than an inferior female, it may be replied, that
<PB N="74" REF="98">
between two broken hearts, the grief mu&s;t be much alike.</P>
<P>The fa&s;cination which thus takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of us in hi&s;torical narratives, is therefore the artifice of the hi&s;torian, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by tho&s;e early prejudices of that &s;uperiority which we attach to great characters. He who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the talent of fine writing, is indeed in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a deceptive art; and I have often been tempted to think, that men of genius, who have ever ap|peared, by the energy of their com|plaints, to be endowed with a peculiar &s;en&s;ibility of &s;orrow, and who excel in the de&s;cription of the pa&s;&s;ions, do not always feel more poignantly than others, who without the power of ex|pre&s;&s;ing their &s;en&s;ations, expanding their &s;entiments, and perpetuating their angui&s;h, are doomed to &s;ilent &s;orrow; to be crazed in love without venting effu&s;ions in ver&s;e, and to pe|ri&s;h
<PB N="75" REF="99">
in de&s;pair without leaving one me|morial of their exqui&s;ite torture.</P>
<P>But I will not clo&s;e this e&s;&s;ay with|out ob&s;erving, that it is not to every illu&s;trious character, recorded in hi&s;|tory, that we can pay too prodigal a tribute of admiration. There are men, who throw a new lu&s;tre on humanity, and hold a torch of in&s;truction which brightens through the clouds of Time. It has been boldly &s;aid, by old Mon|taigne, that man differs more from man, than man from bea&s;t. But &s;pe|culations on human nature mu&s;t not be formed on &s;uch rare in&s;tances. Be|&s;ides, even of characters like the&s;e, their equals may be found among ob|&s;cure individuals, and &s;ome of the noble&s;t actions have been performed by unknown per&s;ons; as that Miner, who in &s;ome Italian war, animated by patriotic fervour, to direct the explo|&s;ion, ru&s;hed into the mine he had formed. This action is the &s;ummit of
<PB N="76" REF="100">
heroi&s;m; his name in the page of hi&s;|tory had been that of a hero; but the individual was &s;o ob&s;cure, that noth|ing but the fact is recorded.</P>
<P>Familiar objects of di&s;tre&s;s, and fa|miliar characters of merit, want only to form a &s;pectacle as intere&s;ting, as the pompous inflation of hi&s;tory can di&s;play, tho&s;e powers of &s;educing elo|quence, which di&s;gui&s;e the &s;implicity of truth, with the romantic grandeur of fiction. Nations have abounded with heroes and &s;ages; but becau&s;e they wanted hi&s;torians, they are &s;carce known to us by name; and individuals have been heroes and &s;ages in dome&s;tic life, who&s;e talents and who&s;e virtues are embelli&s;hed in no hi&s;torical record, but traced, in tran&s;ient characters, on the feeble gratitude of the human heart.</P>

<HEAD>ON PREFACES.</HEAD>
<P>WHATEVER be the con&s;equence of this my &s;olemn prote&s;tation, I de|clare my&s;elf infinitely delighted by a Preface. Is it exqui&s;itely written? no literary mor&s;el is more delicious. Is the author inveterately dull? it is a kind of preparatory information, which may be very u&s;eful. It argues a defi|ciency in ta&s;te to turn over an elabo|rate Preface unread; for it is the odour of the authors ro&s;es; every drop di&s;til|led at an immen&s;e co&s;t. It is the rea|&s;on of the rea&s;oning, and the folly of the fooli&s;h. I agree with the Italians, who call the&s;e little pieces <HI>La &s;alfa del Libro;</HI> the &s;auce of the book.</P>
<P>I do not wi&s;h, however, to conceal, that &s;everal writers, as well as readers, have &s;poken very di&s;re&s;pectfully of this
<PB N="78" REF="102">
&s;pecies of literature. That fine writer, Monte&s;quieu, in clo&s;ing the Preface to his Per&s;ian Letters, &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I do not prai&s;e my Per&s;ians; becau&s;e it would be a very tedious thing, put in a place already very tedious of it&s;elf; I mean a Preface."</Q> Spence, in the Preface to his Polymetis, informs us, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"there is not any &s;ort of writing which he &s;its down to, with &s;o much unwillingne&s;s, as that of Prefaces; and as he believes mo&s;t people are not much fonder of reading them, than he is of writing them, he &s;hall get over this as fa&s;t as he can; both for the readers &s;ake and his own."</Q> An ingenious French writer likewi&s;e inveighs bitterly again&s;t the inventor of Prefaces, and condemns them as &s;o much wa&s;te paper. Peli&s;&s;on warmly prote&s;ted again&s;t prefatory compo&s;i|tion; but when he publi&s;hed the works of Sarra&s;in, was wi&s;e enough to com|po&s;e a very plea&s;ing one. He indeed
<PB N="79" REF="103">
endeavoured to ju&s;tify him&s;elf for act|ing again&s;t his own opinions, by this ingenious excu&s;e, that like funeral honours, it is proper to &s;hew the ut|mo&s;t regard for them when given to others, but to be inattentive to them for our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all this evidence, I have &s;ome good rea&s;ons for admiring Prefaces; and barren as the inve&s;tiga|tion may appear, &s;ome literary amu&s;e|ment can be gathered.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place I ob&s;erve, that a Prefacer is generally a mo&s;t accom|pli&s;hed liar. Is an author to be intro|duced to the public? the Preface is as genuine a panegyric, and nearly as long as one, as that of Pliny's on the Emperor Trajan. Such a Preface is ringing the alarum bell for an author. If we look clo&s;er into the characters of the&s;e ma&s;ters of ceremony, who thus &s;port with and defy the judgment of their reader, and who, by their extra|vagant
<PB N="80" REF="104">
panegyric, do con&s;iderable in|jury to the cau&s;e of ta&s;te, we di&s;cover that &s;ome accidental occurrence has occa&s;ioned this vehement affection for the author, and which, like that of another kind of love, makes one com|mit &s;o many extravagancies.</P>
<P>Prefaces are indeed rarely &s;incere. It is ju&s;tly ob&s;erved by Shen&s;tone in his prefatory E&s;&s;ay to the Elegies, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"di&s;cour&s;es prefixed to poetry incul|cate &s;uch tenets as may exhibit the performance to the greate&s;t advan|tage. The fabric is fir&s;t rai&s;ed, and the mea&s;ures by which we are to judge of it, are afterwards adju&s;ted."</Q> This ob&s;ervation might be exemplified by more in&s;tances than &s;ome readers might chu&s;e to read. It will be &s;uffi|cient to ob&s;erve, with what art, both Pope and Fontenelle, have drawn up their E&s;&s;ays on the nature of Pa&s;toral Poetry, that the rules they wi&s;hed to e&s;tabli&s;h might be adapted to their
<PB N="81" REF="105">
own pa&s;torals. Has accident made &s;ome ingenious &s;tudent apply him&s;elf to a &s;ubordinate branch of literature, or to &s;ome &s;cience which is not highly e&s;teemed, look in the Preface for it's &s;ublime panegyric. Collectors of coins, dre&s;&s;es, and butterflies, have a&s;toni&s;hed the world with eulogiums which would rai&s;e their particular &s;tudies into the fir&s;t ranks of philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>It would appear that there is no lie, to which a Prefacer is not tempted. I pa&s;s over the commodious Prefaces of Dryden, which were ever adapted to the poem, and not to poetry, to the author, and not to literature. The bolde&s;t Preface-liar was Aldus Manu|tius, who having printed an edition of Ari&s;tophanes, fir&s;t publi&s;hed in the Preface, that Saint Chry&s;o&s;tom was accu&s;tomed to place this comic poet under his pillow, that he might always have his works at hand. As in that age, a &s;aint was &s;uppo&s;ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s
<PB N="82" REF="106">
every human talent, good ta&s;te not excepted, Ari&s;tophanes thus recom|mended became a general favourite. The anecdote la&s;ted for near two cen|turies; and what was of greater con|&s;equence to Aldus, quickened the &s;ale of his Ari&s;tophanes. It was at length detected by Menage; and Monnoye, the commentator of Baillet, ob&s;erves, that it is proper to undeceive the world re&s;pecting this ingenious invention of the Prefacer of Ari&s;tophanes.</P>
<P>The in&s;incerity of Prefaces ari&s;es whenever an author would di&s;gui&s;e his &s;olicitude for his work, by appearing negligent and even unde&s;irous of it's &s;ucce&s;s. A writer will rarely conclude &s;uch a Preface without betraying him|&s;elf. I think, that even Dr. John&s;on, forgot his &s;ound dialectic in the admi|rable Preface to his Dictionary. In one part he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"having laboured this work with &s;o much application, I cannot but have &s;ome degree of

<P>But if Prefaces are rarely &s;incere, or ju&s;t, they are notwith&s;tanding literary opu&s;cula, in which the author is ma|terially concerned. A work with a poor Preface, like a per&s;on who comes with an indifferent recommendation, mu&s;t di&s;play uncommon merit to ma&s;|ter our prejudices, and to plea&s;e us, as it were, in &s;pite of our&s;elves.

<P>In Prefaces an affected haughtine&s;s and an affected humility are alike de&s;|picable. The fir&s;t is called by the French, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>La morgue litteraire,</HI>"</Q> the &s;urly pompo&s;ity of literature. This has been frequently practi&s;ed by wri|ters, who have &s;ucceeded in one or two works, while the failure of their other productions appears to have given them a literary hypochondria&s;m. Such a Prefacer, fir&s;t, informs us, that he is above the reach of cen&s;ure; and cen&s;ure therefore redoubles it's vigi|lance. Secondly, that he has already received the approbation of the di&s;|cerning; that is to &s;ay, five or &s;ix gen|tlemen,
<PB N="85" REF="109">
who he admits to his manu|&s;cript recitatives. And thirdly, that he cares very little for the mob; which is a kind expre&s;&s;ion for tho&s;e who ex|change &s;terling money for counterfeit genius. To &s;uch, we may an&s;wer, that no writer can ever be placed above cen&s;ure; that after all his &s;elf-eulogies and &s;elf-con&s;olations, his readers, and not the five or &s;ix gentle|men, can alone give him a &s;olid repu|tation. I &s;hall notice, as a model of this <Q REND="inline">"<HI>morgue litteraire</HI>"</Q> Dr. Arm&s;trong. His "Art of pre&s;erving Health" is one of the mo&s;t ter&s;e, and cla&s;&s;ical compo&s;itions in the language; but mo&s;t of his other ver&s;e, evinces noth|ing but barren labour. In his lively "Sketches," he acquaints us in the Preface, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he could give them much bolder &s;trokes, as well as more delicate touches, but that he dreads the danger of writing too well, and feels the value of his own labour too
<PB N="86" REF="110">
&s;en&s;ibly, to be&s;tow it upon the mo|bility."</Q> This is pure milk, com|pared to the gall, in the Preface to his Poems. There he very mode&s;tly tells us, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he has at la&s;t taken the trouble to collect them. What he has de&s;troyed, would, probably enough, have been better received by the great majority of readers. But he has always mo&s;t heartily de&s;pi&s;ed their opinion."</Q> The truth is, he is only &s;hewing an undue re&s;entment for &s;ome unfortunate productions. To &s;peak thus, is like a certain author, who, to excu&s;e his mi&s;erable ver&s;es, &s;aid, his mu&s;e only &s;ung for her own amu&s;ement; which really is no great crime, if &s;he had not ventured to make her&s;elf ridiculous, by &s;inging in the &s;treets.</P>
<P>The public are treated with another kind of contempt, when an author, in&s;tead of <Q REND="inline">"de&s;troying"</Q> like Dr. Arm|&s;trong; profe&s;&s;es to publi&s;h his pueri|lities.

This Warburton did, in his pompous edition of Shake&s;peare. In the Preface he informed the public, that his notes <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"were among his <HI>younger amu&s;ements,</HI> when he turned over the&s;e <HI>&s;ort of writers.</HI>"</Q> This ungra|cious compliment to Shake&s;peare and the public, merited that perfect &s;cour|ging which our haughty commentator received from the &s;arca&s;tic canons of critici&s;ms. Scudery was a writer of &s;ome genius, and great variety. His Prefaces are remarkable for their ga&s;|conades. In his Epic Poem of Alaric, he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have &s;uch a facility in wri|ting ver&s;es, and al&s;o in my inven|tion, that a poem of double it's length would have co&s;t me little trou|ble.

Preface to his Tran&s;lation of the Prince of Machiavel, in&s;tructs us, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he con&s;iders his copy as &s;uperior to the original, becau&s;e it is every where intelligible, and Machiavel is fre|quently ob&s;cure."</Q> I have &s;een in the play bills of &s;trollers, a very pom|pous de&s;cription of the triumphant entry of Alexander into Babylon; had a prudent &s;ilence not anticipated ima|gination, the triumphant entry might have pa&s;&s;ed without exciting ridicule; and perhaps, one might not &s;o mali|ciou&s;ly have perceived how ill the four candle-&s;nuffers crawled as elephants, and the triumphal car di&s;covered it's want of a lid. But having pre-excited attention, we had full lei&s;ure to &s;harpen our eye. To the&s;e imprudent authors, and actors, we may apply a Spani&s;h proverb, which has the peculiar quaint|ne&s;s of that people; <HI>Aviendo pregonado vino, venden vinagre;</HI> having cried up their wine, they &s;ell us vinegar.</P>

A ridiculous humility in a Preface, is not le&s;s de&s;picable. Many idle apo|logies were formerly in vogue for pub|lication, and formed a literary cant, of which, now the meane&s;t writers per|ceive the futility. A literary anecdote of the Romans has been pre&s;erved, which is &s;ufficiently curious. One Albinus, in the Preface to his Roman Hi&s;tory, intercedes for pardon for his numerous blunders of phra&s;eology; ob&s;erving that they were the more ex|cu&s;eable, as he had compo&s;ed his hi&s;|tory in the Greek language, with which he was not &s;o familiar as his maternal tongue. Cato &s;everely rallies him on this; and ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that our Albinus had merited the pardon he &s;olicits, if a decree of the &s;enate had compelled him thus to have com|po&s;ed it, and provided he could not have obtained a di&s;pen&s;ation. Are the commi&s;&s;ion of faults to be forgiven, which were voluntarily committed?

The confe&s;&s;ion of the ignorance of the language we employ, is like that ex|cu&s;e which &s;ome writers form for com|po&s;ing on topics, of which they ac|knowledge their inability. A reader's heart is not &s;o ea&s;ily mollified; and it is a melancholy truth for literary men, that the plea&s;ure of abu&s;ing an author is generally &s;uperior to that of admi|ring him. One appears to di&s;play more critical acumen than the other, by &s;hewing, that though we do not chu&s;e to take the trouble of writing, we have infinitely more genius than the author. The&s;e &s;uppliant Prefacers are de&s;cribed by Boileau.

The mo&s;t entertaining Prefaces in our language, are tho&s;e of Dryden. They exhibit numberle&s;s graces of a facility of ideas, and roll on with a fluency of &s;tyle, forming &s;o many plea|&s;ing conver&s;ations of the author with his reader. He occa&s;ionally inter&s;per|&s;es little characteri&s;tical &s;trokes of him|&s;elf, and intere&s;ts us in his momentary quarrels and vanities; and though it is ill-naturedly &s;aid, by Swift, that they were merely formed,
<Q><L>"To rai&s;e the volume's price a &s;hilling,"</L></Q>
yet the&s;e were the earlie&s;t commence|ments of Engli&s;h critici&s;m, and the fir&s;t attempt to re&s;train the capriciou&s;|ne&s;s of readers, and to form a national ta&s;te. Dryden has had the candour to acquaint us with his &s;ecret of prefa|tory compo&s;ition; for in that one to his Tales, he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the nature of preface-writing is rambling; never wholly out of the way, nor in it.

of hone&s;t Montaigne."</Q> There is no great ri&s;k in e&s;tabli&s;hing this ob&s;erva|tion as an axiom in literature; but, perhaps, there may be &s;ome danger in following it.

The reader may make a Preface as conci&s;e as he chu&s;es.</P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible for an author to paint him&s;elf in amiable colours, in this u&s;e|ful page, without incurring the con|tempt of egoti&s;m. After a writer has rendered him&s;elf con&s;picuous by his indu&s;try or his genius, his admirers are not di&s;plea&s;ed to hear &s;omething rela|tive to him, from him&s;elf. Mr. Hay|ley, in the Preface to his Poems, has conveyed an amiable feature in his per|&s;onal character, by giving the cau&s;e of his devotion to literature, as the only mode by which he could render him|&s;elf of &s;ome utility to his country.
<PB N="93" REF="117">
The animation of the whole pa&s;&s;age is a te&s;timony of the zeal of it's writer; and who, recollecting the per&s;eve|rance of his &s;tudies, the ju&s;tne&s;s of his ta&s;te, and the elegance of his ver&s;e, can refu&s;e the wreath of poetical ho|nour? There is a mode&s;ty in the Pre|faces of Pope, even when this great poet collected his immortal works; and in &s;everal other writers of the mo&s;t elevated genius, in a Hume and a Robert&s;on, which becomes their happy &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to imitate, and infe|rior writers to contemplate with awe.</P>
<P>I conclude by ob&s;erving, that there is in Prefaces a due re&s;pect to be &s;hewn to the public, and to our&s;elves. He that has no &s;en&s;e of &s;elf-dignity, will not in&s;pire any reverence in others; and the ebriety of vanity will be &s;o|bered by the alacrity we all feel in di&s;turbing the dreams of &s;elf-love. If we dare not attempt the rambling Pre|faces of a Dryden, we may &s;till enter|tain

the reader; and &s;ooth him into good humour, for our own intere&s;t. This, perhaps, will be be&s;t obtained, by making the Preface (like a &s;ym|phony to an opera) to contain &s;ome|thing analogous to the work it&s;elf. The mind thus attuned into a proper harmony of tone, will re&s;pond to the emotions we are preparing to excite, and feel the want of our work, as a de&s;ire not el&s;ewhere to be gratified.</P>

<HEAD>SOME OBSERVATIONS ON DIARIES, SELF-BIOGRAPHY, AND SELF-CHA|RACTERS.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;tudy of Biography is a recent ta&s;te in Britain. The art of writing lives has been but lately known; and it was, therefore, an u&s;ual complaint with the meagre Biographers of the la&s;t century, when their &s;ubject was a man of letters, that his life could not be deemed very intere&s;ting, &s;ince he, who had only been illu&s;trious in his clo&s;et, could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to af|ford any materials for the hi&s;torian. The life of a prime mini&s;ter, or the memoirs of a general, as they con|tained the detail of political intrigues and political oppo&s;ition; battles or &s;tratagems; were con&s;idered to afford happier opportunities for a writer to
<PB N="96" REF="120">
di&s;play the ability of his literary pow|ers, the &s;ubtilty of his di&s;cernment, and the colouring of his de&s;criptions.</P>
<P>But as the human mind became the great object of our inquiry, and to de|tect and &s;eparate the &s;hades of the pa&s;|&s;ions the great aim of the Biographer; reflecting men perceived, that the phi|lo&s;opher, like other men, had his di&s;|tinct characteri&s;tics. The phy&s;ical &s;itu|ation of a human being influences his moral and metaphy&s;ical &s;tate; he who has con&s;umed his years in &s;olitude, will have another cla&s;s of ideas than he who has been habituated to the fri|volous or bu&s;y ranks of men; he who has been always a lover, will have a character different from a &s;atiri&s;t; he who&s;e range of meditation has been circum&s;cribed by mean occupations and little variety, whatever be the energy of his mind, will be a different being to that mortal who has enlarged the circle of his feelings; has &s;tored
<PB N="97" REF="121">
his mind with infinite variations, and embraced and retained whatever he &s;aw, wherever he went.</P>
<P>It has now become the labour of critici&s;m, to compo&s;e the life of an au|thor; and no writer can now &s;ucce&s;s|fully accompli&s;h his Biographic at|tempts, unle&s;s he comes with a por|tion of that genius, the hi&s;tory of who&s;e mind he records; he mu&s;t po&s;|&s;e&s;s a flexibility of ta&s;te, which, like the cameleon, takes the colour of that object on which it re&s;ts.</P>
<P>Every man, in whatever department he moves, has pa&s;&s;ions, which will vary even from tho&s;e who are acting the &s;ame part as him&s;elf. Our &s;ouls, like our faces, bear the general re&s;em|blance of the &s;pecies, but retain the particular form which is peculiar to the individual. He who &s;tudies his own mind, and has the indu&s;try to note down the fluctuations of his opi|nions, the fallacies of his pa&s;&s;ions, and
<PB N="98" REF="122">
the vacillations of his re&s;olutions, will form a journal to him&s;elf peculiarly in|tere&s;ting, and probably, not unde&s;er|ving the meditations of others. No|thing which pre&s;ents a faithful rela|tion of humanity, is incon&s;iderable to a human being. I have often ob&s;erved, with &s;urpri&s;e, how &s;ome pa&s;s their days in noting the revolutions of the &s;ea&s;ons, the rain and the &s;un&s;hine; the more important occupations of be|coming acquainted with their own mind, has never once occurred to them, while they held the weather gla&s;s in their hand.</P>
<P>There once prevailed, and perhaps, it may not be yet quite aboli&s;hed, the cu&s;tom of a man's journali&s;ing his own life. Many of the&s;e journals yet re|main in their MS. &s;tate, and &s;ome, un|fortunately for journal-writing, have been publi&s;hed. We are not, how|ever, to decide on the nature of a work by the ineptitude of it's perform|ance
<PB N="99" REF="123">
The writers of the&s;e Diaries were not philo&s;ophers, for the age was not philo&s;ophic. Too often they were alchemi&s;ts, and &s;ometimes con&s;idered them&s;elves as magicians. Some only regi&s;tered the minute&s;t events of do|me&s;tic life. Dates of birth, and &s;et|tlements of marriage, may be pardoned to the individual; but to give the im|portance of hi&s;tory to the progre&s;s of a purge, and to return divine thanks for the cutting of a corn, (and the edi|ted journal of Elias A&s;hmole contains few other facts,) is giving importance to objects which &s;hould only be ob|&s;ervable in the hi&s;tory of any other ani|mal, but man. I am acquainted with a worthy gentleman, who, for this half century, is performing the &s;ame labours. He can tell where he dined fifty years pa&s;t, and accompany the information with no conci&s;e critique. When he takes one of the&s;e little vo|lumes down, he applies to him&s;elf the
<PB N="100" REF="124">
ob&s;ervation of Martial, and &s;ays, he has learnt the art of living life twice over. The plea&s;ures of memory are delicious; it's objects mu&s;t, however, be proportionate to the powers of vi|&s;ion, and a poor, bad, or excellent dinner, is an object &s;ufficiently delight|ful, or terrible, to give play to the recordatory organs of this Diari&s;t. I have remarked, however, one thing from his contemptible narrative. He re&s;olved to di&s;tingui&s;h the happy cir|cum&s;tances of his life in red ink. In looking over his Diaries, notwith&s;tand|ing the ob&s;curity of his &s;ituation, and the humility of his de&s;ires, I cannot find that his pen was often dipt in the crim&s;on ink of felicity.</P>
<P>An ob&s;ervation may be made on the diurnal page. He who can, without re&s;erve or he&s;itation, form &s;uch a jour|nal, may be &s;afely pronounced an ho|ne&s;t man. Few great men, and no villain, can pur&s;ue, with any regula|rity,
<PB N="101" REF="125">
a &s;eries of their actions; not for want of patience, but of courage; could a Clive, or a Cromwell, have compo&s;ed a Diary? Neither of the&s;e men could &s;uffer &s;olitude and dark|ne&s;s; at the &s;cattered thoughts of ca&s;ual reflection they &s;tarted; what would they have done, had memory mar&s;haled their crimes, and arranged them in the terrors of chronology? The&s;e Diaries form that other Self, which Shafte&s;bury has de&s;cribed every thinking being to po&s;&s;e&s;s; and which, to conver&s;e with, he ju&s;tly accounts the highe&s;t wi&s;dom. When Cato wi&s;hes that every man had a gla&s;s window in his brea&s;t, it is only a metaphorical expre&s;&s;ion for &s;uch a Diary.</P>
<P>There are two &s;pecies of minor Bio|graphy which may be di&s;criminated; detailing our own life, and pourtraying our own character. The writing our own life has been practi&s;ed with vari|ous &s;ucce&s;s; it is a delicate operation;
<PB N="102" REF="126">
a &s;troke too much may de&s;troy the ef|fect of the whole. If once we detect an author deceiving or deceived, it is a livid &s;pot which infects the entire body. To publi&s;h one's own life has &s;ometimes been a poor artifice to bring ob&s;curity into notice; it is the extra|vagance of vanity, and the delirium of egoti&s;m. When a great man leaves &s;ome memorial of his days, his death|bed &s;anctions the truth, and the grave con&s;ecrates the motive. There are certain things which relate to our|&s;elves, which no one can know &s;o well; a great genius obliges po&s;terity when he records them. But they mu&s;t be compo&s;ed with calmne&s;s, with &s;im|plicity, and with &s;incerity; the Biogra|phic Sketch of Hume, written by him|&s;elf, is a model of attic &s;implicity. This is the only production of a man of ge|nius, which requires no graces of &s;tyle or imagination. His pencil &s;hould give dignity to the common accidents
<PB N="103" REF="127">
of life, by it's clear and firm &s;trokes; but he &s;hould be careful not to over|&s;hade and adorn his &s;ketch, by a pen|ciling too elaborate. If he is &s;olici|tous of charming and dazzling, he is not writing his life, but pourtraying the ideal adventurer of a romance. If he attempts to draw a re&s;emblance between him&s;elf and a &s;uperior genius, let him be fearful of incurring the ri|dicule of tho&s;e modern arti&s;ts, who have painted them&s;elves in the dre&s;s of Raphael and Rubens; this &s;elf-admi|ration forms a fatal contra&s;t. Simpli|city of language and thought, are &s;weet and natural graces, which every Self-biographer &s;hould &s;tudy.</P>
<P>If, however, another Rou&s;&s;eau ap|pears, one in whom imagination is a habit, he will, no doubt, expre&s;s feel|ings tremblingly alive, with a corre&s;|pondent delicacy in language; he will effu&s;e his inflammable &s;oul in burning periods. But his Biography is elo|quence;
<PB N="104" REF="128">
it may, indeed, as it was with Rou&s;&s;eau, be only a natural har|mony from the voice of truth; but it may al&s;o be the artificial tones of de|ceit. What in Rou&s;&s;eau was nature, may in others be artifice. Self-biogra|phers, like Hume, who &s;tate facts with an attic &s;implicity, appear to &s;peak unre&s;ervedly to the reader, and as if they propo&s;ed only to &s;upply facts, for others to explain and embelli&s;h.</P>
<P>There is another &s;pecies of minor Biography, which, I am willing to be|lieve, could only have been invented by the mo&s;t refined and the vaine&s;t na|tion. A literary fa&s;hion formerly pre|vailed with authors, to pre&s;ent the public with their own Character. I do not recollect &s;uch a cu&s;tom among our more mode&s;t writers. The French long cheri&s;hed this darling egoti&s;m; and there is a collection of the&s;e lite|rary portraits in two bulky volumes. The brilliant Flechier, and the refined
<PB N="105" REF="129">
St. Evremond, have framed and glazed their portraits. Every writer then con|&s;idered his Character as nece&s;&s;ary as his Preface. I confe&s;s my&s;elf much delighted with the&s;e &s;elf-de&s;criptions of per&s;ons whom no one knows. I have formed a con&s;iderable collection of the&s;e portraits, and have placed them in my cabinet of curio&s;ities, un|der the title of &s;trong likene&s;&s;es of un|known per&s;ons. Their vanity is too prominent to doubt their accuracy.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not excite the reader's curio|&s;ity, without attempting it's gratifica|tion; and if he chu&s;es to &s;ee what now pa&s;&s;es in the minds of many ob&s;cure writers, whom he never will know, let him attend to the following character, which may not be &s;o &s;ingular as it ap|pears.</P>
<P>There was, as a book in my po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion will te&s;tify, a certain ver&s;e-maker, of the name of Cantenac, who, in 1662, publi&s;hed in the city of Paris,
<PB N="106" REF="130">
the above-mentioned volume, contain|ing &s;ome thou&s;ands of ver&s;es, which were, as his countrymen expre&s;s it, <HI>de &s;a facon,</HI> after his own way. He fell &s;o &s;uddenly into the darke&s;t and deepe&s;t pit of oblivion, that not a trace of his memory would have remained, had he not conde&s;cended to give ample in|formation of every particular relative to him&s;elf. He has acquainted us with his &s;ize, and tells us <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that it is rare to &s;ee a man &s;maller than him&s;elf. I have that in common with all dwarfs, that if my head only, were &s;een, I &s;hould be thought a large man."</Q> This atom in creation then de&s;cribes his oval and full face; his fiery and eloquent eyes; his vermil lips; his robu&s;t con&s;titution, and his efferve&s;|cent pa&s;&s;ions.

<P>The de&s;cription of his intellect, is the object of our curio&s;ity, and I &s;elect the

This Character of Cantenac has &s;ome local features; for an Engli&s;h poet would hardly con&s;ole him&s;elf with &s;o much gaiety.

<HEAD>ON THE CHARACTER OF DENNIS THE CRITIC.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since this e&s;&s;ay was compo&s;ed, I have ob&s;erved a very copious article in the Biographia Brittanica, relative to this critic. No alterations have been made in the pre&s;ent character; for nothing contained in this e&s;&s;ay, will be found in the Biographia, where Dennis has received too much honour.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>IT is an ob&s;ervation frequently made, by men of letters in conver&s;ation, whenever &s;ome renowned critic is men|tioned, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he was a very ill-na|tured man."</Q> An ob&s;ervation which is fully verified by facts; &s;o that &s;ome|times we are nearly tempted to &s;uppo&s;e, that ill-nature is the &s;pirit of critici&s;m, The verbal or minor critics, are per|&s;ons of the &s;lendere&s;t faculties, and the mo&s;t ira&s;cible di&s;po&s;itions.

<P>But there is a &s;pecies of critics, who rather attach them&s;elves to mo|dern, than to ancient writers; and who pur&s;ue and &s;ettle on a great ge|nius; as &s;ummer flies attack the tails of the be&s;t fed hor&s;es. The more fer|vid the &s;ea&s;on, and the plumper the hor&s;e, the livelier is the attack. They are born for the torment of the inge|nious, and the gratification of the ma|licious of their age. It has too often happened, that a &s;uperior writer has been mortified during his whole life, by &s;uch a painful &s;hadow; and the wreath, which the public would not otherwi&s;e have refu&s;ed, has been fre|quently with-held, till it only covered the monumental bu&s;t. The ance&s;tors of the&s;e critics appear to have flou|ri&s;hed in the days of Terence, and this poet has di&s;tingui&s;hed them by the ho|nourable

title of the <HI>Malevoli.</HI> Zoilus, who has left them his name, the pa|triarch of <Q REND="inline">"true critici&s;m,"</Q> as Swift calls their talent, fell a martyr to their cau&s;e; for this great man was either burnt, or crucified, or &s;toned.</P>
<P>In the per&s;on of Dennis, we may contemplate the character of the&s;e di&s;|turbers of literary repo&s;e. Of Dennis little appears to be known; this e&s;&s;ay may, perhaps, add &s;omething to that little; for accident led me to an exa|mination of his writings; writings, which, though now rarely known, once made a con&s;iderable figure in Engli&s;h literature, and which lately have been recommended by John&s;on, with more good-nature than good-ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The mind of Dennis was endowed, not with refinement, but with &s;ubtle|ty; not with correctne&s;s, but with minutene&s;s; not with critical judg|ment, but with critical erudition. A
<PB N="114" REF="138">
prominent feature in his character, was that intellectual quality, called common &s;en&s;e, which would have ren|dered him an u&s;eful citizen. A virtue in a &s;adler, but a vice in a critic. In literature, common &s;en&s;e is a penuri|ous faculty, of which all the acqui&s;i|tions are mean, and of little value. If we allow him the&s;e qualities, we mu&s;t utterly deny him that &s;en&s;ibility of ta&s;te which feels the charms of an au|thor, by a congeniality of &s;pirit; that quick apprehen&s;ion which may occa|&s;ionally point out the wanderings of genius, but which oftener confirms the plea&s;ures we feel, by proving their propriety; nor had he that flexibility of intellect which yields to the touch of the object before him; before he ventured to be plea&s;ed, he was com|pelled to con&s;ult Ari&s;totle.</P>
<P>His learning was the bigotry of lite|rature. It was ever Ari&s;totle explain|ed by Dennis. But in the explanation
<PB N="115" REF="139">
of the ob&s;cure text of his ma&s;ter, he was led into &s;uch frivolous di&s;tinctions, and ta&s;tele&s;s propo&s;itions, that his works de&s;erve in&s;pection, as examples of the manners of a true mechanical critic. While his admiration exhales it&s;elf in frigid raptures, amid&s;t his ex|travagant panegyric, he appears fre|quently to be ignorant of the real value of the object he appreciates. Often, indeed, his pur&s;uits conducted him to beautiful forms; but it would &s;eem that they took a new and mon&s;trous figure beneath his di&s;ordered vi&s;ion; to every thing he examines, he adds &s;omething of his own; and the genius of Homer would &s;ink, blended with the dullne&s;s of Dennis.</P>
<P>That our critic was much noticed by the public, would be a national accu|&s;ation, which I am far from alledging. Several &s;ingular coincidencies alone gave the ephemeron critic his tempo|rary exi&s;tence. Critici&s;m was a no|velty
<PB N="116" REF="140">
at that period of our literature. He flattered &s;ome great men, and he abu&s;ed three of the greate&s;t; this was one mode of &s;ecuring popularity; be|cau&s;e, by this contrivance, he divided the town into two parties; and the ira&s;cibility and &s;atire of Pope and Swift, were not le&s;s &s;erviceable to him, than the partial panegyrics of Dryden and Congreve. If in&s;ulted genius had not noticed Dennis, Dennis in vain would have in&s;ulted genius. Some|times his &s;trictures, though virulent, were ju&s;t; even Zoilus, doubtle&s;s, de|tected many defects in Homer. But &s;uch critici&s;ms are only a kind of plate|powder, very u&s;eful to repoli&s;h the works of genius. The performances of our critic appear never to have been popular; and this fact is recorded by him&s;elf. Of the favourable opinion he entertained of his own powers, and the public neglect they received, when not &s;upported by the malignant aid of
<PB N="117" REF="141">
&s;atire, the following pa&s;&s;ages will &s;uf|ficiently prove. In his dedication of his Mi&s;cellaneous Tracts to the Earl of Scarborough, he ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline">"if I had writ only the fir&s;t treati&s;e, I believe, that upon reading it, you will be of opinion, and far be pre&s;umption from that belief, that I had de&s;erved better of the commonwealth of learning, than the authors of &s;o many &s;onorous trifles, who have been <HI>too much encouraged,</HI> while <HI>I have been too much neglected.</HI> The po&s;ition, which is the &s;ubject of it, viz. That religion is that which gives principally to great poetry it's &s;pirit, it's &s;ublimity, it's vehemence, and it's &s;tronge&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;m, is <HI>very clearly proved.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>One more &s;pecimen may be nece&s;|&s;ary. He adds, <Q REND="inline">"that though criti|ci&s;m has flouri&s;hed for 2000 years, de&s;cending from antient Greece and Rome, to modern France and Italy, yet that neither Greece, nor Rome,
<PB N="118" REF="142">
nor France, nor modern Italy, has treated of this important point; but that it was <HI>left for a per&s;on who has the honour of being your lord&s;hip's countryman,</HI> to a&s;&s;ert it, and demon&s;trate it. If what I have &s;aid may &s;eem to &s;ome per&s;ons, into who&s;e hands the&s;e &s;heets may happen to fall, to have too great a tincture of vanity in it, your lord&s;hip knows very well, that <HI>per&s;ons &s;o much and &s;o long oppre&s;&s;ed as I have been,</HI> have been always allowed to &s;ay things concerning them&s;elves, which in <HI>others</HI> might be <HI>offen&s;ive.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>There is a degree of vanity and vex|ation in the&s;e extracts, of which the former is only excu&s;eable for the latter. Excu&s;eable, becau&s;e the con&s;ideration is melancholy, that tho&s;e who devote them&s;elves to literary pur&s;uits, and who may never know their deficien|cies, &s;hould become, in the imbecil|lity of age, the mi&s;erable victims of their unfortunate ignorance. His va|nity
<PB N="119" REF="143">
we know was exce&s;&s;ive, and this oppre&s;&s;ion, of which he complains, might not be le&s;s imaginary than his alarm of being delivered over to the French, for the compo&s;ition of a tra|gedy that could never be read. Den|nis undoubtedly had laboured with zeal, which could never meet a re|ward; and perhaps, amid&s;t his critical labours, he turned often, with an ach|ing heart, from their barren contem|plation, to that of the &s;ocial comforts he might have derived from his pater|nal &s;addles.</P>
<P>His occa&s;ional &s;trictures on popular works had certainly a tran&s;ient &s;ea&s;on. Such critici&s;ms were a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the ac|tivity of envy, and by the &s;upinene&s;s of indolence. The&s;e al&s;o were his be&s;t productions, but I mu&s;t &s;till affirm that they were the be&s;t productions of a dull writer. A beautiful tragedy may be compo&s;ed, which may &s;erve the purpo&s;es of the Denni&s;es; and it's er|rors
<PB N="120" REF="144">
may fill their voluminous pamph|let; but al&s;o, it is very po&s;&s;ible to con|&s;truct a tragedy which would fami&s;h the Denni&s;es, and at the &s;ame time be de&s;titute of whatever can impart de|light to the lover of poetry. Connoi&s;|&s;eurs are to be gratified; but there is a frivolity in connoi&s;&s;eur&s;hip, which could enchain the wing of an eagle with a &s;light texture of &s;ilk.</P>
<P>Dennis a&s;pired al&s;o to original com|po&s;ition; but after a very fair and pa|tient attempt to peru&s;e his works, I de&s;i&s;ted. His ver&s;e is the ver&s;e of one who has learnt poetry, as the blind we know may practice the art; a me|chanical operation performed by &s;ub|&s;tantives and adjectives. His &s;enti|ments are wild, and his lines irregu|lar; turgid expre&s;&s;ions in rumbling ver&s;e; the painful throes of a mu&s;e, who is made to produce mon&s;ters again&s;t the de&s;igns of nature. Such
<PB N="121" REF="145">
ver&s;ifiers are well de&s;cribed by Denham in this line; their works are
<Q><L>"Not the effect of poetry, but pains."</L></Q>
One of his curious epithets of a pair of turtles, is <Q REND="inline">"venereal turtles,"</Q> for I &s;uppo&s;e, the turtles of Venus. Yet Dryden, with the u&s;ual partiality of friend&s;hip, deludes Dennis by eulogies on his poetry, and, in one of his Let|ters, publi&s;hed by our author, advi&s;es him to apply him&s;elf to the pindaric. After this, I believe, Dennis produced his long rambling Ode in prai&s;e of Dry|den, which, perhaps, equals the wor&s;t of Cowley's.</P>
<P>His pro&s;e has little animation, ex|cept when he warms into abu&s;e. His conceptions, indeed, were never deli|cate; but &s;ometimes their gro&s;&s;ne&s;s is &s;triking; as what he &s;ays of Puns, in one of his Letters, <Q REND="inline">"there is as much difference between the &s;illy &s;atisfaction which we have from a quibble, and the ravi&s;hing plea&s;ure which we re|ceive
<PB N="122" REF="146">
from a beautiful thought, as there is betwixt a faint &s;alute, and fruition."</Q></P>
<P>His critici&s;ms are often &s;o many ca&s;tles in the air, for almo&s;t in every work he is propo&s;ing and explaining &s;ome fanta&s;tical &s;y&s;tem. In his long treati&s;e on modern poetry, he labours to &s;hew, that the &s;trong intere&s;t which the ancients felt in their poetry, was derived from that u&s;e of religion which their poets employed; and therefore, he concludes, that if religion is intro|duced into our poems, modern poetry will rival the ancient. But how fal&s;e this &s;y&s;tem is, critici&s;m and experience have now po&s;itively decided. Reli|gion is too aweful an object for the re|ligious to permit human inventions to &s;port with; and the philo&s;opher will acknowledge, that excellence and om|nipotence not conceivable by finite fa|culties, are degraded and enfeebled by human ideas and human language.
<PB N="123" REF="147">
Polythei&s;m was a religion well adapted to poetical fancies; &s;ince nothing can be more poetical than an endle&s;s train of beings, diver&s;ified in their charac|ters, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by their em|blems. The brilliancy of imagination, the gaieties of de&s;cription, and the conflict of the pa&s;&s;ions, alike formed a human intere&s;t in the deities of the an|cients. But the unity of our religion teaches only the le&s;&s;on of obedience, and throwing a veil over the my&s;teri|ous deity, would con&s;ider de&s;cription as impiety, and &s;ilence, as the only ex|pre&s;&s;ion of the human pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Having concluded what I had to ob&s;erve, on the literary character of Dennis, I &s;hall now con&s;ider his moral one. The le&s;&s;on may not prove unin|&s;tructive, for we &s;hall have an oppor|tunity of contemplating how an ill-natured critic, is an ill-natured man, and that the perver&s;ions of the head,
<PB N="124" REF="148">
are &s;o many particles of venom which fly from the heart.</P>
<P>The magi&s;terial deci&s;ions of criti|ci&s;m, may, I &s;u&s;pect, communicate a per&s;onal importance to it's author. Accu&s;tomed to &s;u&s;pend the &s;courge over the heads of the fir&s;t writers of the age, it appears, that Dennis could not &s;it at a table, or walk down a &s;treet, without exerting the de&s;potic rudene&s;s of a literary dictator. The brutal violence of his mind, was di&s;|coverable in his manners; an odd mix|ture of frantic enthu&s;ia&s;m, and gro&s;s dullne&s;s. Pride now elevated, and vaunting, now depre&s;&s;ed and &s;ore. How could the mind that devoted it|&s;elf to the contemplation of ma&s;ter pieces, only to reward it's indu&s;try, by detailing to the public, their human frailties, experience one hour of ame|nity, one idea of grace, one generous expre&s;&s;ion of &s;en&s;ibility? Pope's ce|lebrated de&s;cription of the per&s;onal
<PB N="125" REF="149">
manners of our critic, is an exact re|pre&s;entation.
<Q><L>Lo! Appius reddens at each word you &s;peak;</L>
<L>And &s;tares tremendous with a threatening eye,</L>
<L>Like &s;ome fierce tyrant in old tape&s;try:</L></Q></P>
<P>Dennis had &s;o accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to a&s;perity, and felt with &s;uch facility and force, the irritation he gave and he received, that without having left, on record but the &s;u&s;picion of one im|moral action, (for it is &s;aid he &s;tabbed a man at college) we &s;u&s;pect the im|probity of his heart, when we recol|lect the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of his pen. But this has ever been the characteri&s;tic of this race of critics. They attach to the writer they attack, an inveteracy, which is not permitted by common hu|manity. From their darkened clo&s;et, they &s;uppo&s;e, that the affairs of civil life are &s;u&s;pended, in an aweful pau&s;e, for their deci&s;ions; and they think, that when they have di&s;covered the want of unity in a tragedy, that, in
<PB N="126" REF="150">
con&s;equence, the &s;ame want is imme|diately to take place among the public.</P>
<P>A critic re&s;embling Dennis, was Ga&ccedil;on, in France. This Zoilus re|proached La Motte with his blindne&s;s, and Dennis cruelly cen&s;ured the feeble frame of Pope. Young, in his &s;econd Epi&s;tle to Pope, &s;arca&s;tically alluded to Dennis, in the&s;e words,
<Q><L>"My narrow-minded &s;atire can't extend</L>
<L>To Codrus' form, I'm not &s;o much his friend;</L>
<L>Him&s;elf &s;hould publi&s;h that (the world agree)</L>
<L>Before his works, or in the pillory."</L></Q>
Ga&ccedil;on wrote <Q REND="inline">"&s;atyrical di&s;cour&s;es on all kinds of &s;ubjects,"</Q> and compiled a volume of calumnies again&s;t the poet Rou&s;&s;eau, which he entitled an Anti-Rou&s;&s;eau; <HI>Anti</HI> was long a favourite title to the works of &s;uch critics. Whenever there appeared a great ge|nius, he immediately found an anti|pode.</P>
<P>An anecdote, little known relative to Dennis, will clo&s;e his character.
<PB N="127" REF="151">
It appears, that the Provoked Hu&s;|band was acted for his benefit, which procured him about a hundred pounds. Thom&s;on and Pope generou&s;ly &s;up|ported the old critic, and Savage, who had nothing but a ver&s;e to give, re|turned them poetical thanks, in the name of Dennis. When Dennis heard the&s;e lines repeated (for he was then blind) his critical &s;everity, and his na|tural brutality, overcame that grateful &s;en&s;e he &s;hould have expre&s;&s;ed, of their kindne&s;s and their elegance. He &s;wore <Q REND="inline">"by G&mdash; they could be no one's but that <HI>fool</HI> Savage's."</Q> This, perhaps, was the la&s;t peevi&s;h &s;nuff from the di&s;|mal torch of critici&s;m, for two days after was the redoubted Dennis num|bered with <Q REND="inline">"the mighty dead."</Q></P>
<P>Critici&s;m has thus been often only the natural effect of bad di&s;po&s;itions; when &s;evere, if founded on truth, it is not blamed; but this truth includes the idea of a critic convincing his
<PB N="128" REF="152">
reader, that he has a ju&s;t ta&s;te for the beauties of a compo&s;ition; for that cen&s;ure which only takes a partial re|view of a work, mu&s;t be defective. There is a duty we owe to the public, when we defend the cau&s;e of ta&s;te, but at the &s;ame time, there is a duty we owe to the author. A &s;kilful cen|&s;or will perform his ta&s;k by a happy combination of humanity and criti|ci&s;m; and it is elegantly &s;aid of Boi|leau, by Voltaire, that the honey which this bee extracted from the flowers, &s;oftened the &s;harpne&s;s of the wound he inflicted.</P>
<P>A critic is only the footman of a man of genius, and &s;hould &s;o far re|&s;pect his ma&s;ter, as not to &s;uffer the torch of critici&s;m, which he carries before him, to &s;corch, but only to en|lighten.</P>

<P>IT is nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;criminate be|tween Men of Erudition, and Men of Philo&s;ophy. We mu&s;t employ the French word <HI>Erudit,</HI> for want of a &s;y|nonimous appellative.</P>
<P>A numerous cla&s;s of &s;tudents devote their days to re&s;earches in almo&s;t every &s;pecies of knowledge; and without any profundity of ob&s;ervation, or im|pul&s;e of genius, collect bodies of facts, which may &s;erve as materials for lite|rary &s;peculation.

With them, per&s;evering &s;tudy &s;tands in lieu of exten&s;ive genius, and a long memory in place of a bright fancy. It is not who has greater talents, but who has read mo&s;t. Philo&s;ophy con|&s;i&s;ts of reflection; Erudition of reading. As one man cannot read much more than another, in the &s;ame given time, the Erudits, at a certain period of life, are, therefore, all nearly equal, in point of ability. It is not &s;o in Philo|&s;ophy; there one man in a year may reach farther, than another in all his life; Time, therefore, may make an Erudit, but it is Genius only which can form a Philo&s;opher.</P>
<P>When the elaborate labours of an Erudit, are at length publi&s;hed, it is di&s;covered, that he has no &s;kill in the art of compo&s;ition.

This numerous race of literati, have no conception of that delight in compo&s;ition, without which, the wri|ter is in vain learned.

If a cla&s;&s;ical &s;cholar, ver&s;ifies in Greek, an Engli&s;h poem, which, in the mo&s;t favourable view, is only acting well the &s;chool-boy in the maturity of life, we dignify him with eulogies, which the true poet, he ver|&s;ifies, could not more have merited. For my part, I only con&s;ider as learn|ing that which a man knows by reflec|tion; for that only is of any utility to the individual and the public. It is of

<P>Men of an elevated fancy, have ever treated the&s;e indu&s;trious &s;tudents with great contempt. Hobbes &s;aid, that had he read as much as &s;ome learned men, he had been as ignorant as them. The &s;ingular opinion of De&s;cartes, and his pupil Malebranche, re&s;pecting Erudition, is one of their fanciful wan|derings. The&s;e celebrated metaphy|&s;icians a&s;&s;ert, that the proper &s;tudy of man is truth, con&s;idered as it relates to him&s;elf; that this can only be found in Philo&s;ophy, and that hi&s;tory only pre&s;ents us with trivial or imperfect copies. They conceived more truth to be contained in a moral precept, than in an hi&s;torical fact; and they, there|fore, preferred the cultivation of the under&s;tanding, to that of the memory.</P>
<P>This erroneous &s;y&s;tem has, indeed, been oppo&s;ed; and Bolingbroke ob|&s;erves from an ancient, that <Q REND="inline">"Hi&s;tory

A ma&s;s of minute facts may prove the author to be a profound antiquary, but a &s;hallow philo&s;opher; and it may be ob&s;erved of hi&s;torical compo&s;ition, that the philo&s;opher generally begins at tho&s;e periods where the antiquary concludes.</P>
<P>The&s;e Erudits are characteri&s;ed by an enormous pa&s;&s;ion for collecting books.

Koecherus has written a Treati&s;e on Literary Idolatry. To con|clude this note by a characteri&s;tical anecdote, I &s;hall give one of Tom Hearne, which the late Mr. Warton has in&s;erted in his E&s;&s;ay on Spen&s;er. When this la|borious antiquary publi&s;hed the Chronicle of Robert of Glouce&s;ter, he entered into a warm defence of the <HI>old black letter,</HI> and &s;ays, it is a reproach to us, that the B.

<P>Such an one will, probably, be a man of mean talents, and &s;lender judg|ment. He will collect every thing, till he embarra&s;&s;es his feeble faculties; and amid&s;t all the information po&s;&s;ible, will &s;tand irre&s;olute and ignorant. Di&s;cordant opinions he perceives; but to elicit truth from their concu&s;&s;ion, demands that &s;kill and energy which few Erudits have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.

one &s;olitary idea. This Erudition is a gro&s;s lu&s;t of the mind; it &s;ei&s;es on every thing indi&s;criminately, yet pro|duces nothing; it is pa&s;&s;ion without fruition.</P>
<P>A philo&s;opher having the &s;ame to|pics, will &s;elect the leading circum|&s;tances only as his chief authorities. The art of rejecting, is not le&s;s impor|tant than the art of accumulating; half, &s;ays He&s;iod, is more than the whole. He who wearies all, without wearying him&s;elf, &s;mothers the &s;parks of his fire, by the heaps of his fuel; but a philo&s;opher lights a little wood with the clear and durable flame of genius. It is, perhaps, not too bold, to affirm that the di&s;coveries of medi|tation, are more numerous than tho&s;e of reading; for meditation can pene|trate into tho&s;e ages where facts are unrecorded. It has been &s;ometimes found, that a philo&s;opher, without any other data than his own medita|tions,
<PB N="141" REF="165">
has accounted for circum&s;tances, which have been confirmed by facts, long afterwards di&s;covered by the tar|dy dullne&s;s of the torpid antiquary. Meditation anticipates evidence, or educes from evidence novel truths.</P>
<P>Let us contemplate the&s;e Erudits, as the critics of a cla&s;&s;ical author. Such critics are more delighted by an ob&s;cure expre&s;&s;ion in a fine &s;entence, than with the &s;entence it&s;elf; as ocu|li&s;ts are not di&s;plea&s;ed when their friends have infirm eyes. But even the humble province of annotation, by a philo&s;ophic genius, becomes no contemptible labour; and John&s;on's notes, which are not the mo&s;t e&s;teemed by his unworthy fraternity, frequently appear like an accidental wave roll|ing with vehemence down a &s;tagnant &s;tream.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e violent panegyrics with which they idoli&s;e an author, are as in&s;incere, as they are di&s;gu&s;tful. When a pe|dant
<PB N="142" REF="166">
throws an offering of flowers, on the altar of the Graces, he acts not with the ardour, but the hypocri&s;y of devotion. We have &s;een the&s;e Eru|dits bring forward &s;ome forgotten wri|ter, and who de&s;erved to be &s;o, with a pomp of eulogium that the greate&s;t cannot merit; and even the legitimate applau&s;e due to celebrated authors, they render ridiculous. The&s;e pon|derous minds have been well de&s;cribed by Voltaire, when he ob&s;erves of Da|cier, <HI>Qu'il connoi&s;&s;oit tout des anciens hors la grace et la fine&s;&s;e.</HI> Sen&s;ibility of ta&s;te rarely directs their choice of an au|thor; but merely the accidental col|lection of a number of notes, and often a more trivial circum&s;tance. We have had new editions of ob&s;olete writers, becau&s;e their commentator was born in the &s;ame town, or in the &s;ame king|dom. Authors have been more fre|quently given for the notes, than what &s;hould be, the notes for the author.
<PB N="143" REF="167">
Thus Duchat publi&s;hed editions of &s;e|veral ob&s;cure writers, becau&s;e, having directed his re&s;earches to the middle ages, he was de&s;irous to di&s;charge his adver&s;aria on the public. Scaliger prefered Virgil to Homer, becau&s;e Virgil was his fellow-countryman, and Dacier prefered Homer to all pa&s;t and future poets, becau&s;e he was the mo&s;t ancient.</P>
<P>He who has grown hoary in Erudi|tion, becomes untractable by his va|nity. He regards his hourly di&s;cove|ries with a &s;pirit of &s;elf-exultation, which places him far above the attain|ments of the philo&s;opher. He who is directed by rea&s;on, and relies more on his thinking, than his Erudition, makes few, and often late, di&s;coveries; he who cultivates ta&s;te, often turns, with di&s;plea&s;ure, from unimportant topics; but he who collects and ar|ranges facts, felicitates him&s;elf with new and facile acquirements, and as
<PB N="144" REF="168">
he explores the interminable de&s;ert of Erudition, ama&s;&s;es a va&s;t and min|gled trea&s;ure, and exults in an appa|rent &s;plendour. Milton de&s;cribes the Erudit, who, he &s;ays,

<P>Whenever learning is made to con|&s;i&s;t in words or facts, it is amu&s;ing to ob&s;erve it's effects operating on it's votari&s;ts. The in&s;olence of an anti|quary has no parallel, whenever a &s;ub|ject congenial to his &s;tudies is agitated; becau&s;e, having, with much commen|dable pains, and many patient years, traced the object through all it's po&s;&s;i|ble connections, he knows whatever can be urged, and is con&s;cious that the &s;peaker cannot have acquired more than him&s;elf.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of Anthony Wood, Bi&s;hop Nichol&s;on ob&s;erves, in his Engli&s;h Hi&s;torical Library, that <Q REND="inline">"he had his &s;hare of that <HI>peevi&s;hne&s;s</HI> and <HI>au&s;terity</HI> (both in his &s;tyle and manner) which is commonly incident to <HI>anti|quaries.</HI></Q></NOTE> This gives birth to

many extravagancies of lettered vani|ty; and I have ob&s;erved two recondite antiquaries, kindling in di&s;pute, while one had, perhaps, only a month's, or a day's more reading than his adver|&s;ary. It is thus al&s;o with lingui&s;ts. No cla&s;s of &s;tudents have more exalted notions of their talents, than good lin|gui&s;ts; for having perfected them&s;elves in the verbal &s;cience, they con&s;ider that words are &s;cience it&s;elf, and do not recollect that they are but the keys of the gates. I knew a lingui&s;t who affected to &s;peak lightly of Voltaire, becau&s;e he could not pronounce Eng|li&s;h, as well as our ma&s;ter of languages; and another, who having compiled a grammar, dedicated it to the nation, who honour original genius, and boa&s;t of a Newton.</P>
<P>Such is the character of tho&s;e who would place a convenient limit to the
<PB N="146" REF="170">
human faculties, and &s;atisfied with digging out from the graves of time, &s;ome dead fact, con&s;ider knowledge to be obtainable by the pertinacity of mechanical labour. But as a lingui&s;t may combine and know every word in a language, and yet never attain to any &s;kill in compo&s;ition, &s;o the Erudit may heap fact upon fact, and, not|with&s;tanding, never enlighten. Phi|lo&s;ophy alone can throw the creative beam of light over the dark chaos of Erudition, and awaken into order and beauty the &s;urrounding ma&s;s.</P>
<P>But even Philo&s;ophy will not be &s;uf|ficient to render learning attractive; we mu&s;t al&s;o employ the elegancies of compo&s;ition, and cover the aridity of re&s;earch with the fre&s;he&s;t ro&s;es of ta&s;te. Mo&s;t of the French academicians, in their learned memoirs, have claims on our applau&s;e and imitation; they in|&s;truct us to give the bloom of youth to the wrinkles of learning, and while
<PB N="147" REF="171">
we form an accurate and lucid reci|tal of facts, to interweave reflections which intere&s;t, and to embelli&s;h with a &s;tyle which enchants. We mu&s;t have learning to collect facts; judgment to &s;ei&s;e on tho&s;e which converge to one point, and a brilliant ta&s;te to animate and adorn.</P>

<P>PLINY, in an Epi&s;tle to Tu&s;cus, ad|vi&s;es him to intermix among his &s;eve|rer &s;tudies, the &s;oftening charms of poetry; and notices a &s;pecies of poe|tical compo&s;ition, which merits criti|cal animadver&s;ion. I &s;hall quote Pliny, in the language of his celebrated tran&s;|lator. He &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"the&s;e pieces com|monly go under the title of Poetical Amu&s;ements; but the&s;e amu&s;ements have &s;ometimes gained as much repu|tation to their authors, as works of a more &s;erious nature. It is &s;urpri&s;ing how much the mind is entertained and enlivened by the&s;e little poetical compo&s;itions, as they turn upon &s;ub|jects of gallantry, &s;atire, tenderne&s;s, politene&s;s, and every thing, in &s;hort,
<PB N="149" REF="173">
that concerns life, and the affairs of the world."</Q></P>
<P>This &s;pecies of poetry can only exi&s;t in an age when refinement is introdu|ced into literature, as well as into every thing el&s;e. We mu&s;t, therefore, look for it, in the pre&s;ent day, among a people the mo&s;t refined among it's neighbours; and we ob&s;erve, that it has been carried to it's utmo&s;t perfec|tion, by the French. It has been di&s;|criminated by them, from the ma&s;s of poetry, under the apt title of "<HI>La Po|e&s;ie legere,</HI>" and &s;ometimes it has been &s;ignificantly called "<HI>Vers de Societ&eacute;.</HI>" The French writers have formed a body of this fugitive poetry, which no european nation can rival; and to which both the language and genius, of that once gay and poli&s;hed people, appear to be greatly favourable.</P>
<P>The "<HI>Poe&s;ies legeres</HI>" are not, as their title would appear to import, merely compo&s;itions of a light and gay
<PB N="150" REF="174">
turn, but are equally employed as a vehicle for tender and pathetic &s;enti|ment. They are never long, for they are con&s;ecrated to the amu&s;ement and delight of &s;ociety. Their &s;ubjects are illimitable; but it is required, that &s;ince the author is indulged to &s;port in &s;mall extent, and on a variety of to|pics, that the unde&s;cribable power of originality, gives a value to every little production. The author appears to have compo&s;ed them for his plea&s;ure, not for his glory; and he charms his readers, becau&s;e he &s;eems carele&s;s of their approbation.</P>
<P>The ver&s;ification cannot be too re|fined; melodious and glowing, it &s;hould di&s;play all the graces of poetry. Every delicacy of &s;entiment, mu&s;t find it's de|licacy of &s;tyle, and every tenderne&s;s of thought, mu&s;t be &s;oftened by the ten|dere&s;t tones. Sometimes they &s;hould enchant by di&s;covering the mo&s;t volup|tuous air, &s;ometimes they &s;hould at|tract
<PB N="151" REF="175">
by di&s;playing the &s;plendid orna|ments of diction, and &s;ometimes they may plea&s;e by the natural &s;implicity of ingenuou&s;ne&s;s. Nothing trite or trivial, either in the expre&s;&s;ion or the thought, mu&s;t enfeeble and chill the imagination; nor mu&s;t the ear be de|nied it's gratification, by a rough or carele&s;s ver&s;e. In the&s;e works nothing is pardoned; a word may di&s;turb, a line may de&s;troy the charm.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ions of the poet, may form the &s;ubjects of his ver&s;e. It is in the&s;e writings he delineates him&s;elf; he re|flects his ta&s;tes, his de&s;ires, his hu|mours, his amours, and even his de|fects. In other poems, the poet di&s;|appears under the feigned character he a&s;&s;umes; here alone he &s;peaks, here he acts. He makes a confident of the reader, intere&s;ts him in his hopes, and his &s;orrows; we admire the poet, and conclude with e&s;teeming the man. In the&s;e effu&s;ions the lover may not un|&s;ucce&s;sfully
<PB N="152" REF="176">
urge his complaints; his mi&s;tre&s;s, at lea&s;t, will have the con&s;o|lation of not being wearied by volu|minous grief. They may form a com|pliment for a patron, or a congratula|tion for an arti&s;t; a vow of friend&s;hip, or a hymn of gratitude.</P>
<P>The&s;e poems have often, with great &s;ucce&s;s, di&s;played pictures of Manners; dome&s;tic de&s;criptions are ever plea&s;ing; and it is here that the poet colours the objects with all the hues of life, and the variations of nature. Reflections mu&s;t, however, be artfully interwo|ven, in a compre&s;&s;ed and rapid man|ner. Moral in&s;truction mu&s;t not be amplified; the&s;e are pieces devoted to the fancy; and while reflection is in|dulged, the imagination feels it&s;elf defrauded; a &s;cene may be painted throughout the poem; a &s;entiment mu&s;t be conveyed in a ver&s;e. In the Grongar Hill of Dyer, we di&s;cover &s;ome &s;trokes which may &s;erve to ex|emplify
<PB N="153" REF="177">
this critici&s;m. The poet con|templating the di&s;tant land&s;cape, ob|&s;erves,
<Q><L>"A &s;tep methinks may pa&s;s the &s;tream,</L>
<L>So little, di&s;tant dangers &s;eem;</L>
<L>So we mi&s;take the future's face,</L>
<L>Ey'd thro' Hope's deluding gla&s;s."</L></Q>
Moral reflections, which are u&s;ually obvious and tedious, if thus naturally educed, and rapidly &s;truck off, con|tra&s;t with great beauty the lighter and more airy parts.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not be &s;uppo&s;ed, that be|cau&s;e the&s;e productions are conci&s;e, they have, therefore, the more facility; we mu&s;t not con&s;ider the genius of a poet diminutive, becau&s;e his pieces are &s;o; nor mu&s;t we call them, as a fine &s;onnet has been called, a difficult trifle. A circle may be very &s;mall, yet it may be as mathematically beau|tiful and perfect as a larger one. To &s;uch compo&s;itions we may apply the ob&s;ervation of an ancient critic, that
<PB N="154" REF="178">
though a little thing gives perfection, yet perfection is not a little thing. The&s;e compo&s;itions may, by the &s;kill of the poet, be made to contain beau|ties of every kind; but what is even &s;uperior to beauty, and in what &s;ome of our fine&s;t poets have failed, is that grace, that colouring of fancy, that harmony of ideas, that deliciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;entiment, which, pervading every particle of the compo&s;ition, is per|ceived by the &s;en&s;ibility of ta&s;te, while it eludes the analy&s;ing touch of criti|ci&s;m. The&s;e little pieces are &s;u&s;cepti|ble of all the variety of poetical ex|pre&s;&s;ion; from the &s;ilver notes of the pa&s;toral flute, to the &s;onorous &s;well of the epic trumpet. They may be all delicacy, or all grandeur.</P>
<P>The poet, to &s;ucceed in the&s;e ha|zardous pieces, mu&s;t be an amiable voluptuary; alike poli&s;hed by an in|tercour&s;e with the world, as with the &s;tudies of ta&s;te; to whom labour is
<PB N="155" REF="179">
negligence; refinement a &s;cience, and art a nature. Genius will not always be &s;ufficient to impart that grace of amenity which &s;eems peculiar to tho&s;e, who, among other advantages, are accu&s;tomed to the elegance of the higher cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety; I mean, how|ever, among the few enlightened in|dividuals of this de&s;cription. Many of the French nobility, who cultivated poetry, have, therefore, often excelled in the&s;e poetical amu&s;ements, the at|tempts of &s;ome profe&s;&s;ed poets. France once delighted, and placed in the fir&s;t rank of poetical ta&s;te, the amiable and ennobled names of Nivernois, Bouf|flers, and St. Aignan; they have not been con&s;idered as unworthy rivals of Chaulieu and Bernard, of Voltaire and Gre&s;&s;et. But the&s;e productions are more the effu&s;ions of ta&s;te, than ge|nius; and it is not &s;ufficient that the poet is in&s;pired by the mu&s;e, but he mu&s;t al&s;o &s;uffer his conci&s;e page to be
<PB N="156" REF="180">
poli&s;hed by the hand of the Graces. He mu&s;t not hope to be crowned with laurels, but he may receive a wreath of flowers.</P>
<P>All the minor odes of Horace, and the entire Anacreon, are compo&s;itions of this kind; effu&s;ions of the heart, and pictures of the imagination, which were produced in the convivial, the amatory, and the pen&s;ive hour. Our nation has not always been &s;ucce&s;sful in the&s;e performances; they have not been kindred to it's genius. With Charles II. &s;omething of a gayer and more airy ta&s;te was communicated to our poetry; but it was de&s;ultory, in|correct, and wild. It was the awk|ward e&s;&s;ays towards refinement, which a ru&s;tic may be &s;uppo&s;ed to make. Among the minor poets of that period, we occa&s;ionally trace the ver&s;atile &s;pi|rit of the&s;e poems. Waller, both by his habits, and his genius, was well adapted to excel in this lighter poetry;
<PB N="157" REF="181">
and he has often attained the perfec|tion which the &s;tate of the language then permitted. Prior has a variety of &s;allies; but his humour is &s;ometimes gro&s;s, and his ver&s;ification is &s;ometimes heavy and embarra&s;&s;ed. He knew the value of the&s;e charming pieces; and he had drank of this burgundy in the vineyard it&s;elf. He has &s;ome tran&s;la|tions, and &s;ome plagiari&s;ms; but &s;ome of his ver&s;es to Chloe are eminently airy and plea&s;ing. We have few wri|of this cla&s;s, who can be propo&s;ed as models. A popular poet of this age has often delighted us with the deli|cate graces of his mu&s;e; and while we admire the felicity of his clo&s;es, he teaches us the value of a happy thought. But tho&s;e minor poems, re|lating to dome&s;tic pa&s;&s;ions, and dome&s;|tic manners, which might merit to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the title of "VERS DE SOCIETE," appear &s;till to be wanted; and a poet who &s;hould com|po&s;e

<HEAD>ON "THE ENLIGHTENED PUBLIC," AND "THE AGE OF REASON."</HEAD>
<P>RICHARDSON makes a plea&s;ing compari&s;on of national virtues, which, &s;ays he, are fir&s;t like the &s;eed, which produces the blade, then the green ear, and la&s;tly the ripe corn. A pro|gre&s;&s;ive &s;tate is ob&s;ervable in the moral, like that in the natural world, and may al&s;o be traced in the character of an individual, as well as in that of a people.</P>
<P>But it is not with the human head, as with the human heart. The per|fection of any virtue is obtainable, but perhaps never that of knowledge; the actions of a hero are perfect, but the works of a &s;cholar may in time be found erroneous; Alexander is &s;till our hero, but Ari&s;totle has cea&s;ed to
<PB N="160" REF="184">
be our preceptor. Learning is variable and uncertain, virtue is &s;imilar and permanent; an action of benevolence, or heroi&s;m, can never change in it's nature, but a &s;y&s;tem of philo&s;ophy, or a &s;chool of ta&s;te, mu&s;t be annihilated by new philo&s;ophies and new ta&s;tes.</P>
<P>Some &s;peculative moderns have formed extravagant notions of that al|mo&s;t unimaginable perfection, to which human knowledge is rapidly conduct|ing us. Hartley, in one of his &s;ublime and incomprehen&s;ible imaginations, leaves it to the knowledge of the next age to trace and comprehend. Some living philo&s;ophers, who are only ad|ding the Engli&s;h den&s;ity of thinking to the French &s;ubtilty of fancy, conjec|ture that we may &s;o improve our or|gani&s;ation, as to extend our duration; that the mind may attain an infinite perfectibility; and that the intellectual faculties are tran&s;mi&s;&s;ible from the parent to the &s;on, as &s;ometimes are
<PB N="161" REF="185">
the features and the habits. Philo&s;o|phical conjecture rolling with this o&s;cillatory motion, is merely an inebri|ation of poetry.</P>
<P>We are, however, ince&s;&s;antly re|minded of the <HI>enlightened</HI> &s;tate of the public; but the te&s;timony of authors becomes &s;u&s;picious, for in per&s;uading us that we are thus illuminated, they infer by implication that they are &s;ingu|larly &s;o, &s;ince they give us very u&s;eful in&s;truction. The expre&s;&s;ion was, I think, fir&s;t the happy coinage of Vol|taire, made current by his numerous di&s;ciples; Voltaire adored the public and him&s;elf; and this artful expre&s;&s;ion is at once imprinted with adulation and egoti&s;m.</P>
<P>It is certain that in former periods the human mind &s;hot from a radical vigour, and flouri&s;hed in the riche&s;t luxuriance. Among the ancients, not|with&s;tanding they were heathens, the fine and mechanical arts have been
<PB N="162" REF="186">
con&s;idered to have exceeded our hap|pie&s;t efforts; and as for the intellectual powers and the moral duties, though mo&s;t of the compo&s;itions of the&s;e ancients have been lo&s;t, yet enough have remained to &s;erve as models for our greate&s;t poets; to in&s;truct our orators in the arts of eloquence; our hi&s;torians in the compo&s;ition of hi&s;tory, and to leave nothing for our morali&s;ts, but an expan&s;ion of the ob&s;ervations of Seneca and Epictetus.</P>
<P>Had one of our modern philo&s;ophers lived in tho&s;e ages, would he not, in the enthu&s;ia&s;m of his meditations, have expre&s;&s;ed the flattering &s;entiment now &s;o prevalent; and throwing his glance into remote futurity, have progno&s;ti|cated a &s;aturnian age, when every citizen &s;hould be a philo&s;opher, and the univer&s;e one entire Rome? But it is the error of men, who, pre&s;uming to de&s;cribe at &s;o va&s;t an interval, imagine circum&s;tances and connexions which
<PB N="163" REF="187">
have no exi&s;tence; as it is often found that lands, which appeared united when ob&s;erved remotely, are in reality eternally &s;eparated by the ocean.</P>
<P>Among the mo&s;t &s;anguine, and the mo&s;t &s;ingular of modern philo&s;ophers, is the worthy Abb&egrave; de Saint Pierre. The hone&s;ty of his heart exceeded the rectitude of his under&s;tanding. His project of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"An Univer&s;al Peace,"</Q> by the infelicity of his &s;tyle, could find no readers; a philanthropi&s;t as &s;ingu|lar, but more eloquent, the celebrated Rou&s;&s;eau, embelli&s;hed the neglected labour, enabled us to read the per|formance, and perceive it's humane imbecillity. It was no dull conception of a Dutch trader, who having in|&s;cribed on his &s;ign the words <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Perpe|tual Peace,"</Q> had painted under it, a church-yard. Our good Abb&egrave; had a notion that an age was not di&s;tant, when &s;uch would be the progre&s;s of that ma&s;s of light, which was daily
<PB N="164" REF="188">
gathering, that it would influence every &s;pecies of knowledge, and pe|netrate to the lowe&s;t orders of &s;ociety. This future generation is to be re|markable for the force of it's rea&s;on, and the &s;everity of it's truth. It is therefore only to permit works of uti|lity; to contemn the ornaments of eloquence, and the charms of poetry; but it may be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that our prophet was neither an orator, nor a poet. A literary anecdote is re|corded, which at lea&s;t proves his firm per&s;ua&s;ion of this future age; and per|haps he was one of the very few pro|phets who believed in their own pre|dictions. He was once pre&s;ent at the recitation of one of tho&s;e works which are only valued for the graces of their compo&s;ition, and the felicity of their manner. A performance of &s;uch ta&s;te would not therefore be read by the more rea&s;onable beings of his meta|phy&s;ical age. He appeared frigid and
<PB N="165" REF="189">
unmoved, while the audience was en|raptured. His opinion was a&s;ked; he &s;miled, and &s;aid&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"It is a thing which is YET thought to be fine!"</Q></P>
<P>Another of the&s;e chimerical, yet grand &s;peculators, appears to me to have been the celebrated Leibnitz, who conceived the extravagant notion of forming one nation of all Europe; for he propo&s;ed to reduce Europe un|der one temporal power, in the Em|peror, and under one &s;piritual, in the Pope; and to con&s;truct an univer&s;al philo&s;ophical language. This great &s;cholar is an example of the fatal at|tachment which a &s;uperior mind may experience for a &s;y&s;tem of which it is blindly enamoured, and to which it &s;acrifices it's own &s;en&s;ations, and it's own convictions. Leibnitz was a ge|nuine philo&s;opher, and a friend to humanity; his project of an univer&s;al language evinces this; but having once fixed on a &s;y&s;tem, he yielded up
<PB N="166" REF="190">
that deare&s;t intere&s;t to a philo&s;opher, the pro&s;perity of the human mind; for what tyrant could have forged more permanent chains for intellectual free|dom, than placing man under two &s;uch powers? If this project had been po&s;&s;ible to effect, the other of the phi|lo&s;ophical language had been u&s;ele&s;s; philo&s;ophy then would not have been allowed a language.</P>
<P>He who thinks, will perceive in every enlightened nation, three kinds of people; an incon&s;iderable number in&s;tructed by rea&s;on, and glowing with humanity; a countle&s;s multitude, bar|barous and ignorant, intolerant and inho&s;pitable; and a vacillating people with &s;ome rea&s;on and humanity, but with great prejudices, at once the half-echoes of philo&s;ophy, and the adherents of popular opinion. Can the <HI>public</HI> be denominated <HI>enlightened?</HI> Take an exten&s;ive view among the various orders of &s;ociety, and ob&s;erve
<PB N="167" REF="191">
how folly &s;till wantons in the vigour of youth, and prejudice &s;till &s;talks in the &s;tubbornne&s;s of age.</P>
<P>To trace the human mind as it ex|i&s;ts in a people, would be the only method to detect this fallacious ex|pre&s;&s;ion. The unenlightened numbers, who are totally uninfluenced by the few, live in a foul world of their own creation. The moral arithmetician, as he looks for the &s;um total of the un|enlightened public, mu&s;t re&s;emble the algebrai&s;t, who riots in incalculable quantities, and who &s;miles at the &s;im|ple &s;avage, who&s;e arithmetic extends not further than the number of three.</P>
<P>In a metropolis, we contemplate the human mind in all it's inflections. If we were to judge of men by the condition of their <HI>minds,</HI> (which per|haps is the mo&s;t impartial manner of judging) we &s;hould not con&s;ult the year of their birth, to date their ages; and an intellectual regi&s;ter might be
<PB N="168" REF="192">
drawn up, on a totally different plan from our parochial ones. A per&s;on may, according to the vulgar era, be in the maturity of life, when by our philo&s;ophical epocha he is born in the tenth century. That degree of mind which regulated the bigotry of a monk in the middle ages, may be di&s;covered in a modern rector. An adventurous &s;pirit in a red coat, who is almo&s;t as de&s;irous (to u&s;e the wit of South) to receive a ki&s;s from the mouth of a cannon, as from that of his mi&s;tre&s;s, belongs to the age of chivalry, and if he &s;hould compo&s;e ver&s;es, and be mag|nificently prodigal, he is a gay and noble troubadour. A &s;arca&s;tic philo|&s;opher, who in&s;tructs his fellow citi|zens, and retires from their &s;ociety, is a contemporary with Diogenes; and he who reforming the world, graces in&s;truction with amenity, may be placed in the days of Plato. Our vul|gar politicians mu&s;t be arranged among
<PB N="169" REF="193">
the Roundheads and Olivers, and Tom Paine him&s;elf is &s;o very ancient as to be a contemporary of Shimei. The re&s;ult of our calculations would be, that the enlightened public form an incon&s;iderable number.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t however be confe&s;&s;ed, that what knowledge has been accumu|lated by modern philo&s;ophy, cannot ea&s;ily peri&s;h; the art of printing has imparted &s;tability to our intellectual &s;tructures, in what depends on the me|chanical pre&s;ervation. Human &s;cience can no more be annihilated by an Omar. A &s;ingular &s;pectacle has, there|fore, been exhibited; and it is &s;ome|times urged by tho&s;e who contemplate, with plea&s;ing a&s;toni&s;hment, the actual progre&s;s of the human mind, as a proof of the immutability of truth, that in the pre&s;ent day, every enlightened in|dividual, whether he re&s;ides at Paris, at Madrid, or at London, now thinks alike; no variation of climate, no re|motene&s;s
<PB N="170" REF="194">
of place, not even national prejudices, more variable and more remote than either, de&s;troy that una|nimity of opinion, which they feel on certain topics e&s;&s;ential to human wel|fare.</P>
<P>This appears to be a &s;pecious argu|ment in favour of the enlightened pub|lic. But we &s;hould recollect, that this unanimity of opinion, which &s;o frequently excites &s;urpri&s;e, is owing to their deriving their ideas from the &s;ame &s;ources; at Paris, at Madrid, and at London, the &s;ame authors are read, and, therefore, the &s;ame opi|nions are formed.</P>
<P>Thus we account for this unanimity of opinion; and we may now rea&s;on|ably enquire if <HI>unanimity of opinion</HI> al|ways indicates <HI>permanent truth?</HI> It is certain that very extravagant opinions were once univer&s;ally received; it be|comes not an individual to affirm that &s;ome of our modern opinions are mar|vellou&s;ly
<PB N="171" REF="195">
extravagant; we mu&s;t leave them for the deci&s;ion of po&s;terity. We may, however, &s;ay to the greate&s;t genius, look at what your equals have done, and ob&s;erve how frequently they have erred. Reflect, that whenever an Ari&s;totle, a De&s;cartes, and a New|ton appeared, they formed a new epo|cha in the annals of human know|ledge; it is not unrea&s;onable to add one, among your thou&s;and conjec|tures, and &s;ay, that their future rivals may trace new connections, and col|lect new facts, which may tend to an|nihilate the &s;y&s;tems of their predece&s;|&s;ors. Is not opinion often local, and ever di&s;gui&s;ed by cu&s;tom? is not what we call truth often error? and are not the pa&s;&s;ions and ideas of men of &s;o very temporary a nature, that they &s;carce endure with their century? This en|lightened public may di&s;cover that their notions become ob&s;olete, and that with new &s;y&s;tems of knowledge,
<PB N="172" REF="196">
and new modes of exi&s;tence, their books may be clo&s;ed for their &s;ucce&s;|&s;ors, and only con&s;ulted by the curi|ous of a future generation, as we now examine Ari&s;totle and De&s;cartes, Ari&s;|tophanes and Chaucer. Our learning may no more be their learning, than our fa&s;hions will be their fa&s;hions. Every thing in this world is fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>It may al&s;o be conjectured, that amid&s;t the multitude of future di&s;co|veries, the original authors of our own age, the Newtons and the Lockes, may have their conceptions become &s;o long familiari&s;ed, as to be incorporated with the novel di&s;coveries, as truths &s;o inconte&s;tible, that very few &s;hall even be acquainted with their fir&s;t di&s;|coverers. It would therefore appear, that the ju&s;tne&s;s, as well as the extra|vagance of our authors, are alike ini|mical to their future celebrity.</P>
<P>But this in&s;tability never attends the noble exertions of virtue. Whoever
<PB N="173" REF="197">
chu&s;es to immortali&s;e his name, by an action of patrioti&s;m, or of philan|thropy, will meet the certain admira|tion of po&s;terity. To render a &s;ervice to another is in the power of the meane&s;t individual; but to aggrandi&s;e the gentle affections into &s;ublime pa&s;|&s;ions, to ri&s;e from the &s;ocial circle to the public weal, to extend our ordi|nary life through years of glory, is performing that which once rai&s;ed men into demi-gods; but which, in the pre&s;ent age, would not only find little imitation, but much ridicule.

<HEAD>OF LICENSERS OF THE PRESS.</HEAD>
<P>IN the hi&s;tory of human oppre&s;&s;ion, a prominent event will be that of the employing of a vigilant centinel on the thoughts, as well as on the bodies of authors. The in&s;titution of Licen&s;ers of the Pre&s;s, or Cen&s;ors of Books, was the la&s;t hope of de&s;pairing bigotry; and not only, for a con&s;iderable time, retarded the acceleration of philo&s;o|phy, but may be &s;aid to have effected a temporary annihilation; for what author has &s;o little vanity as to write what mu&s;t be refu&s;ed the honours of publication?</P>
<P>Had not &s;everal accidental circum|&s;tances e&s;tabli&s;hed the freedom of the pre&s;s, it might be difficult, by a retro|grade calculation, to fix on that low degree, at which, to the pre&s;ent mo|ment,
<PB N="175" REF="199">
popular opinion, with a &s;omni|ferous &s;tability, had re&s;ted. Europe had now been more barbarous than in her cloudie&s;t ages; for the pre&s;s had become an in&s;trument, not to re&s;train, but to extend; not to undermine, but to prop; not to wre&s;tle with, but to cheri&s;h tho&s;e inhuman prejudices which were once dignified by the holy titles of Religion and Politics. A Locke and a Monte&s;quieu had never exi&s;ted for the world, and at this day we &s;hould have admired, like our pre|dece&s;&s;ors, the &s;ubtilties of an Aquinas, and the doctrines of a Filmer. Our ideas had been fabricated in an inqui|&s;itorial forge, and though they would not have con&s;i&s;ted of a variety of forms, they would not have wanted that heat which might have given durabi|lity.</P>
<P>The Inqui&s;itors having long exa|mined and deprecated a va&s;t multitude of publications, which the freedom of
<PB N="176" REF="200">
foreign pre&s;&s;es allowed, and their cri|tical occupations after the revolution of Luther, becoming greater and more important at every hour, they were de&s;irous of a&s;&s;i&s;ting tho&s;e of their nu|merous adherents, who were fearful of employing their own eyes, and tru&s;ting to their own &s;en&s;ations, by pre&s;erving them in their antiquated cecity. It was now they invented the &s;cheme of printing catalogues of pro|hibited books, which they called EX|PURGATORY INDEXES. Almo&s;t every new work augmented the&s;e volumi|nous catalogues; and, perhaps, in &s;ome re&s;pect, they invited readers to publications which might not other|wi&s;e have attracted notice. It is cu|rious to reflect on the u&s;e which the two parties made of them; for while the pious catholic cro&s;&s;ed him&s;elf at every title, and frequently breathed an ori&s;on for the eternal damnation of the authors, the Heretics on the contrary
<PB N="177" REF="201">
would purcha&s;e no book which had not been in&s;erted in the&s;e indexes. The Heretic had certainly a finer ta&s;te, and a more lively entertainment in reading, than the pious catholic; for the mo&s;t animated and the mo&s;t va|luable authors, have found their way into the&s;e indexes. Nothing then, but orthodoxical dullne&s;s, was exempt from cen&s;ure. Among the cruel ab|&s;urdities of that day, is an edict from the French King, to forbid the unfor|tunate profe&s;&s;or Ramus the reading of his own works, and which, &s;o very frequently, is the only real plea&s;ure &s;ome writers receive from their la|bours.</P>
<P>The venerable authors of the&s;e in|dexes, long, indeed, had rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive credulity was attached to the human character; and, therefore, they con&s;idered that the publications of their adver&s;aries re|quired no other an&s;wer, than an in|&s;ertion
<PB N="178" REF="202">
in their indexes. Literary con|trover&s;y was threatened to be eternally annihilated, by this conci&s;e and com|modious mode. They multiplied edi|tions throughout Europe; but the He|retics as indu&s;triou&s;ly reprinted them with ample prefaces, and u&s;eful anno|tations. In our country, Dr. James, of Oxford, republi&s;hed an index, with proper animadver&s;ions. One of their portions included, a li&s;t of tho&s;e He|retics who&s;e heads were condemned as well as their works. It is curious to ob&s;erve, that as the&s;e indexes were formed in different countries, the opi|nions were diametrically oppo&s;ite to each other; the examiners in Italy, under the title of the Council of Trent, prohibited what tho&s;e in the Nether|lands admitted; and &s;ome inqui&s;itors, who complained of the partial conduct of the&s;e catalogues, were, in their turn, placed by the confraternity in their indexes; retaliation &s;ucceeded
<PB N="179" REF="203">
retaliation. To the pre&s;ent moment &s;uch indexes are formed in Spain, and at Rome, where, in the&s;e archives of the dotage of bigotry, may be read, the names of every modern philo&s;o|pher who has written to the pre&s;ent hour.</P>
<P>When the&s;e in&s;ertions were found of no other u&s;e, than to di&s;per&s;e the criminal volumes, the eccle&s;ia&s;tical arm was employed in burning them in public places; and among &s;everal anecdotes of &s;ending authors to the flames before their time, Monnoie di&s;|covered in one of the&s;e &s;epulchral fires, that an edition of Jo&s;ephus had been burnt, not, &s;ays he, becau&s;e the an|cient author was a jew, but that the tran&s;lator was a jan&s;eni&s;t. The&s;e lite|rary conflagrations &s;erved the purpo&s;es of book&s;ellers; and the publi&s;her of Era&s;mus's Colloquies intrigued for the burning of the work, on purpo&s;e to rai&s;e the &s;ale; and he &s;old 24,000.

<P>The fancy of the poet, and the ve|racity of the hi&s;torian, were alike am|putated, by cen&s;ors of books; a &s;imile, or even an epithet, might &s;end the im|mortal bard to the galleys, and as for the di&s;cernment and freedom to be ex|pected in an hi&s;torian, who&s;e genius was fir&s;t to be clo&s;eted with &s;uch an examiner, we may form an idea, by quoting the u&s;ual expre&s;&s;ion in the pri|vileges. In Nani's Hi&s;tory of Venice, it is allowed to be printed, becau&s;e it contained <HI>nothing again&s;t princes.</HI> This mode of approbation &s;hews either that princes were immaculate, or hi&s;torians were ignorant or fal&s;e. A book in Spain pa&s;&s;es through &s;ix courts before it can be publi&s;hed; and in Portugal, it is &s;aid, through &s;even. A book in
<PB N="181" REF="205">
tho&s;e countries is &s;uppo&s;ed to recom|mend it&s;elf to the reader, by the in|formation that it is publi&s;hed with <HI>all</HI> the nece&s;&s;ary privileges. The works of Locke and Monte&s;quieu, Voltaire and Rou&s;&s;eau, &amp;c. are at the pre&s;ent moment prohibited throughout Italy, and, I believe, in every catholic coun|try; the favourite authors of Europe, mu&s;t be obtained by &s;ecrecy, and read in concealment.</P>
<P>Our literary hi&s;tory has been &s;o little perpetuated, either by tradition, or by record, that there are few individual topics which can be pur&s;ued through a concatenation of events. We glean facts in the &s;cattered notices of foreign literature; but when we come to our own country, we find that a ta&s;te for this plea&s;ing &s;pecies of erudition, has never been much cultivated, though there have been periods which mu&s;t have afforded ample materials. John|&s;on, who loved as much as the great
<PB N="182" REF="206">
Leibnitz, the events of literature, has commenced his lives of the poets, with a complaint of <Q REND="inline">"the penury of Engli&s;h biography."</Q> Our authors have groaned under the leaden arm of Li|cen&s;ers of the Pre&s;s, and no doubt many intere&s;ting facts have peri&s;hed, which would have in&s;tructed the pre|&s;ent generation. I &s;hall ever pre&s;erve, with a religious care, one durable mark of that tyranny which once fixed it's talons on the Engli&s;h pre&s;s. The Poems of Lord Brooke, if they cannot delight, accidentally in&s;truct po&s;terity in the value of freedom of thinking. In this book one is &s;urpri&s;ed at finding twenty of it's fir&s;t pages deficient. Mr. Malone, by an entry in the MSS. of the Ma&s;ter of the Revels, has di&s;co|vered that the&s;e pages contained a poem on religion, which was can|celled by the order of Archbi&s;hop Laud, who probably con&s;idered that re|ligion
<PB N="183" REF="207">
ligion could not be &s;ecure in the hands of any one but an Archbi&s;hop.</P>
<P>The ignorance and &s;tupidity of the&s;e cen&s;ors, became as remarkable as their exterminating &s;pirit. The noble &s;imile of Milton, of Satan with the ri&s;ing-&s;un, in the fir&s;t book of the Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, we happen to know, had almo&s;t oc|ca&s;ioned the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of that immor|tal epic.

and who appear to have brought the &s;ame &s;ervility of mind to the examina|tion of works of genius. There is &s;omething, which, on the principles of incongruity and contra&s;t, becomes exqui&s;itely ludicrous, in ob&s;erving the works of &s;uch writers as Voltaire, d'Alembert, Marmontel, and Raynal, allowed to be printed, and even com|mended, by certain per&s;ons, who had never printed any thing them&s;elves but their names.

<HEAD>ON READING.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE writing is ju&s;tly denominated an art, I think that reading claims the &s;ame di&s;tinction. To adorn ideas with elegance, is an act of the mind, &s;upe|rior to that of receiving them, and is the province of genius; but to receive them with a happy di&s;crimination, is a ta&s;k not le&s;s u&s;eful, and can only be the effect of a ju&s;t ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Yet it will be found that a ju&s;t ta&s;te is not &s;ufficient to obtain the proper end of reading. Two per&s;ons of equal ta&s;te ri&s;e from the peru&s;al of the &s;ame book with very different notions; the one will not only have the ideas of the author at command, and &s;trongly im|bibe his manner, but will have en|riched his own mind by a new acce&s;|&s;ion of matter, and find a new train
<PB N="190" REF="214">
of &s;entiment awakened and in action. The other quits his author in a plea|&s;ing di&s;traction, but of the plea&s;ures of reading, nothing remains but a tu|multuous &s;en&s;ation. He has only de|lighted him&s;elf with the brilliant co|louring, and the mingled &s;hadows of a variety of objects, while the other re|ceives the impre&s;&s;ion not only of the colours and the &s;hades, but the di&s;|tinct grace, and the accurate forms of the objects.</P>
<P>To account for the&s;e different effects, we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to a logical di&s;|tinction, which appears to reveal one of the great my&s;teries in the art of reading. Logicians di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween perceptions and ideas. Percep|tion is that faculty of the mind which notices the &s;imple impre&s;&s;ion of ob|jects; but when the&s;e objects exi&s;t in the mind, and are there trea&s;ured and arranged as materials for reflection, then they are called ideas. A percep|tion
<PB N="191" REF="215">
is like a tran&s;ient &s;un-beam, which ju&s;t &s;hews the object, but leaves nei|ther light nor warmth; while an idea is like the fervid beam of noon, which throws a &s;ettled and powerful light.</P>
<P>Many ingenious readers complain that their memory is defective, and their &s;tudies unfruitful. This defect, however, ari&s;es from their indulging the facile plea&s;ures of perceptions, to the laborious habit of forming them into ideas. We mu&s;t not deceive our|&s;elves. Perceptions require only the &s;en&s;ibility of ta&s;te, and their plea&s;ures are continuous, ea&s;y, and exqui&s;ite. Ideas not only require the &s;ame power of ta&s;te, but an art of combination, and an exertion of the rea&s;oning pow|ers, which form no mean operation of the mind. Ideas are therefore la|bours; and for tho&s;e who will not un|dergo the fatigue of labour, it is unju&s;t to complain, if they come from the har|ve&s;t with &s;carce a &s;heaf in their hands.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="216">
The numerous cla&s;s of readers of ta&s;te, who only prefer a book to the odd trick at whi&s;t, have, therefore, no rea&s;on to murmur, if that which is only taken up as an amu&s;ement, &s;hould terminate like all amu&s;ements, in tem|porary plea&s;ure. To be wi&s;er and bet|ter, is rarely the intention of the gay and the frivolous; the complaints of the gay and the frivolous, are nothing but a new manner of di&s;playing gaiety and frivolity; they are lamentations full of mirth.</P>
<P>There are &s;ecrets in the art of read|ing, which tend to facilitate its pur|po&s;es, by a&s;&s;i&s;ting the memory, and augmenting intellectual opulence. Some, our own ingenuity mu&s;t form, and perhaps every &s;tudent, has an ar|tificial manner of recollection, and a peculiar arrangement; as, in &s;hort hand, almo&s;t every writer has a &s;y&s;tem of his own. There are, however, &s;ome regulations which appear of general
<PB N="193" REF="217">
utility, and the few, my own ob&s;erva|tions have produced, I &s;hall venture to communicate.</P>
<P>It is an ob&s;ervation of the elder Pliny, (who, having been a volumi|nous compiler, mu&s;t have had great experience in the art of reading) that there was no book &s;o bad, but which contained &s;omething good. It is ne|ce&s;&s;ary, however, to ob&s;erve, that ju&s;t and obvious as this reading axiom may appear, it requires a commentary to be under&s;tood. To read every book would be fatal to the intere&s;t of mo&s;t readers; they who only &s;eek in &s;tudy for mere plea&s;ure, would be continu|ally di&s;appointed; for the ob&s;ervation is only adapted to that phlegmatic per&s;everance which &s;eems to find plea|&s;ure in mere &s;tudy. He who only &s;eeks for information, mu&s;t be con|tented to pick it up in ob&s;cure paths, to mount rugged rocks for a few flow|ers, and to pa&s;s many days bewildered
<PB N="194" REF="218">
in dark fore&s;ts, and wild de&s;erts. The reader of erudition may therefore read every book. But he who only de&s;ires to gratify a more delicate &s;en&s;ation, who would only fill his heart with de|licious &s;entiment, and his fancy with bright imagery, in a word, the reader of ta&s;te mu&s;t be contented to range in more contracted limits, and to re&s;trict him&s;elf to the paths of cultured plea|&s;ure grounds. Without this di&s;tinc|tion in reading, &s;tudy becomes a la|bour painful and interminable; and hence readers of ta&s;te complain that there is no term to reading, and read|ers of erudition that books contain no|thing but phra&s;es. When the former confine them&s;elves to works of ta&s;te, their complaints cea&s;e, and when the latter keep to books of facts, they fix on the proper aliment for their in&s;ati|able curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>Nor is it always nece&s;&s;ary, in the pur&s;uits of learning, to read every
<PB N="195" REF="219">
book entire. Perhaps this ta&s;k has now become an impo&s;&s;ibility, notwith|&s;tanding tho&s;e o&s;tentatious erudits, who, by their infinite and exact quo|tations, appear to have read and di|ge&s;ted every thing; readers, artle&s;s and hone&s;t, have conceived from &s;uch writers, an illu&s;ive idea of the power and exten&s;ivene&s;s of the human facul|ties. Of many books it is &s;ufficient to &s;ei&s;e the plan, and to examine &s;ome of it's portions. The quackery of the learned, has been often expo&s;ed; and the art of quoting fifty books in a morning, is a ta&s;k neither difficult nor tedious. There is a little &s;upplement placed at the clo&s;e of every volume, of which few readers conceive the utility; but &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent writers in Europe, have been great adepts in the art of index-reading. An index-reader is, indeed, more let into the &s;e|crets of an author, than the other who attends him with all the tedious forms
<PB N="196" REF="220">
of ceremony; as tho&s;e Courtiers who pay their public devoirs at court, are le&s;s familiar with the Mini&s;ter, than the few who merely enter the cham|ber of audience, and who generally &s;teal up the back &s;tairs, and hold their &s;ecret con&s;ultations with the Mini&s;ter him&s;elf. I, for my part, venerate the inventor of indexes; and I know not to whom to yield the preference, either to Hippocrates, who was the fir&s;t great anatomi&s;er of the human body, or to that unknown labourer in literature, who fir&s;t laid open the nerves and ar|teries of a book.</P>
<P>It may be unnece&s;&s;ary al&s;o, to read all the works of an author, but only to attach our&s;elves to tho&s;e which have received the approbation of po&s;terity. By this &s;cheme we become acquainted with the fine&s;t compo&s;itions in half the time tho&s;e employ, who, attempting to read every thing, are often little ac|quainted with, and even ignorant of
<PB N="197" REF="221">
the mo&s;t intere&s;ting performances. Thus of Machiavel, it may be &s;uffici|ent to read his Prince and his Hi&s;tory of Florence; of Milton nearly all his Poetry, little of his Pro&s;e, and nothing of his Hi&s;tory; of Fielding's twelve volumes, &s;ix may be &s;ufficient; and of Voltaire's ninety, perhaps thirty may &s;atisfy. Of Lord Che&s;terfield's Let|ters, the third volume is the e&s;&s;ential one, and concentrates the whole &s;y&s;|tem. A reader is too often a pri&s;oner attached to the triumphal car of an author of great celebrity, and when he ventures not to judge for him&s;elf, conceives, while he is reading the in|different works of great authors, that the languor which he experiences, ari&s;es from his own defective ta&s;te. But the be&s;t writers, when they are voluminous, have a great deal of me|diocrity; for whenever an author at|tains to a facility in compo&s;ition, the &s;ucce&s;s of his preceding labours, not
<PB N="198" REF="222">
only &s;timulate him to new perfor|mances, but prejudice the public in their favour; and it is often no &s;hort period before the public, or the au|thor, are &s;en&s;ible of the mediocrity of the performances.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide, readers mu&s;t not imagine that all the plea&s;ures of com|po&s;ition depend on the author; for there is &s;omething which a reader him|&s;elf mu&s;t bring to the book, that the book may plea&s;e. There is a literary appetite which the author can no more impart, than the mo&s;t &s;kilful cook can give an appetency to the gue&s;ts. When Cardinal Richelieu &s;aid to Go|deau, that he did not under&s;tand his ver&s;es, the hone&s;t poet replied, that it was not his fault. It would indeed be very unrea&s;onable, when a painter exhibits his pictures in public, to ex|pect that he &s;hould provide &s;pectacles for the u&s;e of the &s;hort-&s;ighted. Every man mu&s;t come prepared as well as he
<PB N="199" REF="223">
can. Simonides confe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in|capable of deceiving &s;tupid per&s;ons; and Balzac remarked of the girls of his village, that they were too &s;illy to be deceived by a man of wit. Dullne&s;s is impenetrable; and there are hours when the livelie&s;t ta&s;te lo&s;es it's &s;en&s;i|bility. The temporary tone of the mind may be unfavourable to ta&s;te a work properly, and we have had many erroneous critici&s;ms from great men, which may often be attributed to this circum&s;tance. The mind communi|cates it's infirm di&s;po&s;itions to the book, and an author has not only his own defects to account for, but al&s;o tho&s;e of his reader. There is &s;ome|thing in compo&s;ition, like the game of &s;huttlecock, where, if the reader does not quickly rebound the feathered cork, to the author, the game is de|&s;troyed, and the whole &s;pirit of the work falls extinct.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="224">
A frequent impediment in reading, is a di&s;inclination in the mind, to &s;ettle on the &s;ubject; agitated by incongru|ous and di&s;&s;imilar ideas, it is with pain that we admit tho&s;e of the author. But it is certain, that if we once apply our&s;elves, with a gentle violence, to the peru&s;al of an intere&s;ting work, the mind &s;oon a&s;&s;imilates the &s;ubject; the di&s;inclination is no more, and like Homer's chariot wheels, we kindle as we roll. The ancient Rabbins, who pa&s;&s;ed their days in their madra&s;&s;es or &s;chools, and who certainly were great readers of their mo&s;t voluminous Tal|mud, advi&s;ed their young &s;tudents to apply them&s;elves to their readings, whether they felt an inclination or not, becau&s;e, as they proceeded, they would find their di&s;po&s;ition re&s;tored, and their curio&s;ity awakened. Philo|&s;ophy can ea&s;ily account for this fact; it is &s;o certain, and acts with &s;uch power, that even indifferent works are
<PB N="201" REF="225">
frequently fini&s;hed, merely to gratify that curio&s;ity which it's early pages have communicated. The ravenous appetite of John&s;on for reading, is ex|pre&s;&s;ed in a &s;trong metaphor, by Mrs. Knowles, who &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"he knows how to read better than any one; he gets at the &s;ub&s;tance of a book directly; he tears out the heart of it."</Q></P>
<P>We &s;hould he&s;itate to pronounce on a work of &s;ome merit, on the fir&s;t pe|ru&s;al, for that is rarely attended by a proper reli&s;h. It is with reading as with wine; for connoi&s;&s;eurs have ob|&s;erved, that the fir&s;t gla&s;s is in&s;ufficient to decide on it's quality; it is nece&s;&s;ary to imbue the palate, to give it that racine&s;s of reli&s;h, which communicates every latent quality, and enables us to judge as keenly as the two uncles of Sancho.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome mechanical aids in reading, which may prove of great utility, and form a kind of rejuvene&s;|cene
<PB N="202" REF="226">
of our early &s;tudies. Montaigne placed at the end of tho&s;e books which he intended not to reperu&s;e, the time he had read it, with a conci&s;e deci&s;ion on it's merits; that, &s;ays he, it may thus repre&s;ent to me, the air and ge|neral idea I had conceived of the au|thor, in reading the work. He has obliged his admirers with giving &s;eve|ral of the&s;e annotations. Of Young the poet, it is noticed, that whenever he came to a &s;triking pa&s;&s;age, he folded the leaf; and that at his death, books have been found in his library, which had long re&s;i&s;ted the power of clo&s;ing. A mode more ea&s;y than u&s;eful; for after a length of time, they mu&s;t be again read to know why they were folded. This difficulty is obviated by tho&s;e, who note in a blank leaf, the pages to be referred to, with a word of critici&s;m. Nor let us con&s;ider the&s;e minute directions as unworthy the mo&s;t enlarged minds; by the&s;e petty
<PB N="203" REF="227">
exertions at the mo&s;t di&s;tant periods, may learning obtain it's authorities, and fancy combine it's ideas. Seneca, in &s;ending &s;ome volumes to his friend Lucillius, accompanies them with notes of particular pa&s;&s;ages that, he ob&s;erves, you who only aim at the u&s;eful, may be &s;pared the trouble of examining them entire. I have &s;een books noted by Voltaire with a word of cen&s;ure or approbation on the page it&s;elf, which was his u&s;ual practice; and the&s;e volumes are precious to every man of ta&s;te. Somebody com|plained that the books he lent Voltaire were returned always disfigured by his remarks; but he was a true German writer of the old cla&s;s.</P>
<P>A profe&s;&s;ional &s;tudent &s;hould divide his readings into an <HI>uniform</HI> reading which is u&s;eful, and into a <HI>diver&s;ified</HI> reading which is plea&s;ant. Guy Patin, an eminent phy&s;ician and man of let|ters, had a ju&s;t notion of this manner;
<PB N="204" REF="228">
and I &s;hall quote his words. He &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"I daily read Hippocrates, Galen, Fernel, and other illu&s;trious ma&s;ters of my profe&s;&s;ion; this I call my profitable readings. I frequently read Ovid, Ju|venal, Horace, Seneca, Tacitus, and others, and the&s;e are my recreations."</Q> We mu&s;t ob&s;erve the&s;e di&s;tinctions, for it frequently happens that a lawyer or a phy&s;ician, with great indu&s;try and love of &s;tudy, by giving too much into his diver&s;ified readings, may utterly neglect what &s;hould be his uniform &s;tudies.</P>
<P>An author is often cruelly morti|fied to find his work repo&s;ing on a harp&s;ichord or a table, with it's virgin pages. Among the mortifications of the elegant Mickle, was this, that the lord to whom he had dedicated his ver&s;ion of the Lu&s;iad, had long the epic in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, in the &s;tate he had received it. How often al&s;o are authors mortified to perceive, that generally the fir&s;t volume of their
<PB N="205" REF="229">
work is ever fouler than it's brother! It is, therefore, an advantage to com|po&s;e in &s;ingle volumes; for then they flatter them&s;elves, a &s;econd would be acceptable; but mo&s;t books are more read for curio&s;ity, than for plea&s;ure; and are often looked into, but rarely re&s;umed. Authors are vain, but read|ers are capricious.</P>
<P>Readers may be cla&s;&s;ed into an infi|nite number of divi&s;ions; but an au|thor is a &s;olitary being, who, for the &s;ame rea&s;on he plea&s;es one, mu&s;t con|&s;equently di&s;plea&s;e another. To have too exalted a genius, is more prejudi|cial for his celebrity, than to have a moderate one; for we &s;hall find that the mo&s;t popular works, are not of the highe&s;t value, but of the greate&s;t u&s;e|fulne&s;s. I could mention &s;ome e&s;|teemed writers, who&s;e works have at|tained to a great number of editions, but who&s;e minds were never yet in|flamed by an accidental fervour of ori|ginal
<PB N="206" REF="230">
genius. They in&s;truct tho&s;e who require in&s;truction, and they plea&s;e tho&s;e, who are yet &s;ufficiently ignorant to di&s;cover a novelty in their &s;trictures; in a word they form ta&s;te, rather than impart genius. A Carlo Marat, is a Raphael to tho&s;e who have not &s;tudied a Raphael. They may apply to them|&s;elves the &s;ame ob&s;ervation Lucilius, the &s;atiri&s;t, has made, that he did not write for Per&s;ius, for Scipio, and for Rutilius, per&s;ons eminent for their &s;ci|ence, but for the Tarentines, the Con|&s;entines, and the Sicilians. Montaigne has complained that he found his read|ers too learned, or too ignorant, and that he could only plea&s;e a middle cla&s;s, who have ju&s;t learning enough to comprehend him. Congreve &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"there is in true beauty, &s;omething which vulgar &s;ouls cannot admire."</Q> And, we may add, there is &s;omething in exqui&s;ite compo&s;ition, which ordi|nary readers can never under&s;tand.</P>

<HEAD>ON POETICAL EXPRESSION.</HEAD>
<P>ONE of the grand di&s;tinctions of poetry con&s;i&s;ts in a peculiarity of phra&s;e, and novelty of expre&s;&s;ion; for no mechanical arrangements, not even &s;entiment or imagery, (for pro&s;e can retain all the&s;e qualities) can form the e&s;&s;ential di&s;tinction between ver&s;e and and pro&s;e. The genuine diction of poetry is totally di&s;tinct from pro&s;aic compo&s;ition, and the charm ari&s;es from it's being removed from familiar lan|guage. From this e&s;tabli&s;hed and ac|knowledged principle may be deduced the following facts.</P>
<P>Hence may be accounted the ex|treme delight found in the ancient cla&s;&s;ics, which, with &s;ome, has ari&s;en to &s;uch an extravagance. A judicious critic will allow, that a pa&s;&s;age in

But the plea&s;ure may not be equal in the mo|dern as in the ancient; nor is this the mere effect of an artificial &s;en&s;ation ac|quired at the univer&s;ity, but on the contrary it is a natural emotion. The ancient enjoys the peculiar felicity of employing a diction, which to us mu&s;t be immaculate; a magnificence of &s;ound, and a novelty of combination, rai&s;e it to their language of the gods; we are offended by no feeblene&s;s of terms, and no familiarity of expre&s;&s;ion. And if the fancy of the Latin &s;hould fall, a turn of diction, which might have been but common, and in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t ordinary ver&s;ifier in the days of Virgil, will &s;upport it; and it is thus that ideas which would excite no attention in a modern, may charm in an ancient. Hence too, modern poets, who write Engli&s;h ver&s;e, with|out
<PB N="210" REF="234">
genius or ta&s;te, have often com|po&s;ed in Latin with &s;ome powers. We no doubt di&s;cover a hundred beau|ties in Horace and Virgil, which could not have been &s;uch to their contempo|raries, becau&s;e the language was not &s;ufficiently remote from them. I &s;hall give two very poetical expre&s;&s;ions in Virgil, which I now recollect, and he has many &s;imilar ones. The&s;e felici|tous expre&s;&s;ions, full of the true &s;pirit of poetry, were probably no novelties when he wrote them. The poet &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Dum trepidant</HI> ALAE"</Q> and <Q REND="inline">"SONI|PES,"</Q> where, in the fir&s;t, <HI>wings</HI> are un|der&s;tood for <HI>birds,</HI> and in the &s;econd, <HI>&s;ounding-feet</HI> for <HI>hor&s;es.</HI> The effect for the cau&s;e. An Engli&s;h poet, to de|&s;cribe birds, has no novelty of term; three or four expre&s;&s;ions offend by their frequent recurrence; and the mean &s;ound of the noun it&s;elf dimini&s;hes the beauty of many a fine poetical pa&s;&s;age, by making it wear a pro&s;aic appear|ance.
<PB N="211" REF="235">
Our modern poets have not in|vented a poetical term for one of their mo&s;t favourite objects. Dryden in ver&s;ifying the celebrated &s;imile of Vir|girl's Nightingale, has happily called the young, <Q REND="inline">"the unfeathered inno|cence."</Q></P>
<P>Virgil has al&s;o, in his Georgics, an expre&s;&s;ion &s;o truely inimitable, that our language appears not to afford a corre&s;pondent delicacy, and exact tint of phra&s;e. When the poet de&s;cribes Eurydice, at the moment before &s;he is wounded by the &s;nake concealed in the gra&s;s, as if animated by a pre&s;cient fervour, he exclaims&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"<HI>moritura puella</HI>"</Q> The reader of ta&s;te feels an emotion of &s;urpri&s;e and curio&s;ity. Tran&s;late this happy word literally into pro&s;e, and the grace mu&s;t be as fugitive as Eury|dice her&s;elf, <Q REND="inline">"the maid about to die."</Q> The charm ari&s;es, if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf, from the conci&s;e amplitude of idea, the &s;ingle word conveys. All
<PB N="212" REF="236">
our tran&s;lators have failed in catching the evane&s;cent beauty. 
<Q><L>"The dying bride."</L>
<BIBL>Dryden.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><L>"She doomed to death."</L>
<BIBL>Trapp.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><L>"The fated maid."</L>
<BIBL>Warton.</BIBL></Q> 
In none of the&s;e is a &s;imilar emotion rai&s;ed in the mind of the reader, which he receives from the "Moritura." Dryden's, indeed, is &s;ingularly excep|tionable, and Warton's the happie&s;t; yet <Q REND="inline">"fated"</Q> is a general idea, and lo&s;es that delicate &s;hade of appropria|tion, of the <Q REND="inline">"about to die."</Q></P>
<P>In an inferior degree, we may ex|tend our principle to modern lan|guages; for, to me, it has often ap|peared, that a pa&s;&s;age from Ta&s;&s;o, has given to an Engli&s;h reader, a plea&s;ure which a native cannot experience; the plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from a language who&s;e graces have not become fami|liar by ordinary recurrence.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="237">
I conceive that the effect of the &s;ame principle may be traced in our own earlier writers. One of their peculiar charms is their ancient &s;tyle; and cer|tain phra&s;es, which are generally un|der&s;tood, delight, like a painting which is ju&s;t embrowned and mellowed by the hand of time. If we contra&s;t a fine pa&s;&s;age in Shake&s;peare, with a rival one in a modern poet, allowing them an equal force, we &s;hould not he&s;itate to give the preference to the elder bard. The lively plea&s;ure with which &s;ome men of ta&s;te read Chaucer, may be a&s;cribed to their &s;en&s;ibility of a language, which di&s;plays many graces, inve&s;ted with that novelty of poetical expre&s;&s;ion, which would cea&s;e to &s;trike were they familiar.</P>
<P>Hence we may deduce a curious fact; that one of the mo&s;t difficult branches in modern poetry, or in the poetical art, in all ages of refinement, is, the formation of a new &s;tyle, or
<PB N="214" REF="238">
poetical diction. This demands not only a &s;uperior genius, but a &s;u&s;picion may ari&s;e that our language in this re|&s;pect is nearly exhau&s;ted. And this will appear, if we examine the fine&s;t compo&s;itions publi&s;hed within the la&s;t thirty years; where one eminent de|fect will often be prevalent; that the general ca&s;t of the language has little variations; expre&s;&s;ions are interwoven, which the poet nicely picked out of the performances of his predece&s;&s;ors, to embroider his own; and though, &s;ometimes, a new combination of ideas, or a felicity of &s;ubject, render a poem intere&s;ting, yet the poetical trea&s;ury of diction receives but few acce&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>That this has been an effect felt by poets, who are not apt to inve&s;tigate cau&s;es, appears by the following ob|&s;ervations and facts.</P>
<P>Milton, who&s;e notions of poetry were of the mo&s;t exalted nature, when he propo&s;ed compo&s;ing an epic, per|ceived
<PB N="215" REF="239">
the nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;tructing a new diction, or as him&s;elf expre&s;&s;es it,
<Q><L>"To build the lofty rime."</L></Q>
In his &s;maller productions he was &s;a|tisfied to employ the language of his contemporaries, becau&s;e in a &s;hort compo&s;ition he might form new com|binations of &s;tyle, without pur&s;uing any particular &s;y&s;tem. What, there|fore, has this great poet attempted? An introduction of all the happie&s;t idioms of every language with which his exten&s;ive learning was acquainted. Hebrai&s;ms and Greci&s;ms, Latini&s;ms and Italiani&s;ms, poured them&s;elves to his copious mind; and what John&s;on has termed <Q REND="inline">"the pedantry of his &s;tyle,"</Q> true ta&s;te will, perhaps, acknowledge as an attempt to &s;ei&s;e on tho&s;e felici|tous expre&s;&s;ions which more nicely re|veal our &s;en&s;ations, bring the object clo&s;er to the eye of imagination, and which light and &s;hade nature in her variety of hues. Dryden adorned his
<PB N="216" REF="240">
language al&s;o by many Latini&s;ms; and Pope is acknowledged to have formed a diction, which in his day had all the attractions of novelty. Of all our poets, Gray had the livelie&s;t &s;en&s;ibility for this beauty, which he has expre&s;&s;ed by <Q REND="inline">"words that burn."</Q> It has ever appeared &s;ingular, that a poet of his ability has &s;tudied &s;o much, and pro|duced &s;o little. It is not improbable that he could not &s;atisfy his own deli|cacy of ta&s;te, in the creation of a new poetical diction; and this, I think, ap|pears by tho&s;e few exqui&s;ite perfor|mances he has left, which, like mo&s;aic pavements, are richly inlaid, and mo&s;t vividly painted, but are not the virgin veins of native marble from the quarry. Scarce an expre&s;&s;ion in the poetry of Gray but appears to have been imi|tated or borrowed from his predece&s;|&s;ors. What he has given evinces his aim; and we may conclude that it is one of the grand characteri&s;tics of mo|dern
<PB N="217" REF="241">
poetry, and one of the greate&s;t ob&s;tacles in that plea&s;ing art.</P>
<P>Another ob&s;ervation may confirm this principle. Whenever, in the pro|gre&s;s of refinement, the poetical lan|guage becomes thus difficult, it is ob|&s;ervable that true genius, often weary with imitatively echoing the e&s;tabli&s;h|ed diction, at once falls back into the manner of the earlier poets. Some ex|pre&s;&s;ions of our elder writers have a marvellous effect in modern ver&s;e, when the writer appears to give them not with verbal affectation, but &s;pon|taneous felicity. It has been thus in France, where the poet Rou&s;&s;eau has in many of his compo&s;itions e&s;&s;ayed to &s;eize on the naivet&eacute; of Marot, by co|pying his &s;tyle, but his &s;trained affec|tation produces a di&s;agreeable effect. Churchill rejected an artificial diction, and too often ver&s;ifies like Oldham; for an editor of this poet's works has contra&s;ted pa&s;&s;ages from the modern
<PB N="218" REF="242">
&s;atiri&s;t, which equal the di&s;cordance of Oldham's ver&s;e. When Churchill introduces a poetical expre&s;&s;ion from our elder poets, it has often a very plea&s;ing effect. Mr. Cooper, and his imitators, can only be con&s;idered as having a&s;&s;umed the diction and the manner of our old poets; a critical feeling perceives, in their blank ver&s;e, the tones of Shake&s;peare. The &s;tyle of a living poet in his &s;atires, is the preci&s;e manner of &s;ome of our old poets; and in his delicate minor poems, where a poetical diction was unavoid|able, we di&s;cover few novel combina|tions of expre&s;&s;ion; their excellence con&s;i&s;ting in the &s;implicity and tender|ne&s;s of the ideas.</P>
<P>It has been con&s;idered as a poetical beauty to aggrandi&s;e the minute by the pomp of expre&s;&s;ion. When objects, or circum&s;tances, by their exility or meanne&s;s, would occa&s;ion no agree|able &s;en&s;ation, &s;ome have thought it
<PB N="219" REF="243">
an evidence of higher art, to dignify them by the grandeur of the &s;tyle; in a word, as I heard a man of genius &s;ay of a painter, <Q REND="inline">"he knew to give dig|nity to a dunghill."</Q> But this has often been carried to exce&s;s, by a fa&s;tidious refinement. Boileau has been ap|plauded (becau&s;e he fir&s;t applauded him&s;elf, which is a certain way of &s;e|curing the approbation of many) for having rai&s;ed into poetical language, the &s;imple idea of his wearing a wig at the age of fifty eight. The lines are thus,
<Q><L>"Mais adjourdhui, qu'enfin la vielle&s;&s;e e&s;t venue,</L>
<L>Sous mes faux cheveux blonds deja toute ohenue,</L>
<L>A jett&eacute; &s;ur ma t&ecirc;te, avec &s;es doigts pe&s;ans,</L>
<L>Onze lu&s;tres complets, &s;urcharg&eacute;s de trois ans."</L></Q>
To me there appears a puerility in the&s;e celebrated lines, notwith&s;tanding the age of the venerable &s;atiri&s;t; the de&s;cription is exact, and the expre&s;|&s;ion beautiful; but the poet deba&s;es his art, for when the reader recollects
<PB N="220" REF="244">
the <HI>wig,</HI> mu&s;t he not &s;mile at this mock &s;ublime? A pompous inanity which Velleius Paterculus employs, relative to a petty precaution made u&s;e of by Ce&s;ar, is a remarkable in&s;tance of difficulty of expre&s;&s;ion. When this great man was taken by the pirates, he lived among them like their con|queror, rather than their pri&s;oner. The hi&s;torian then proceeds in the&s;e words. <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Neque unquam aut nocte, aut die (cur enim quod vel maximum e&s;t, &s;i narrari verbus &s;pecio&s;is non pote&s;t, omitta|tur?) aut excalcearetur, aut di&s;cingeretur.</HI>"</Q> Which may be thus tran&s;lated&mdash;Nor even by night, nor by day, (for &s;hould I &s;ilently omit a circum&s;tance becau&s;e not expre&s;&s;ible in &s;plendid terms) he quitted&mdash;his gown and &s;lippers&mdash;Is not the affectation of the writer &s;en&s;ible? But this quotation may &s;erve to inforce the &s;ubject of this e&s;&s;ay; for to me it appears that the &s;onorous Latin terms of <HI>excalcearetur</HI> and <HI>di&s;cingeretur</HI> take
<PB N="221" REF="245">
much from the familiarity of the ex|pre&s;&s;ion. This tumid pa&s;&s;age mu&s;t have been more &s;hocking to a man of ta&s;te, in the days of Paterculus, than it is now.</P>
<P>To pro&s;aic compo&s;ition we may al&s;o extend our principle. Purity of lan|guage is not a characteri&s;tic of &s;tyle, in an age of refinement. The great writers will &s;olicitou&s;ly domiciliate the mo&s;t elegant foreign idioms, and hence the latini&s;ms of John&s;on, and the gal|lici&s;ms of Gibbon. The more exqui|&s;ite our ta&s;te, the more de&s;irous we are of expre&s;&s;ing it's exqui&s;itene&s;s; no writer complains of paucity of expre&s;|&s;ion in the fir&s;t progre&s;s of ta&s;te; for it is long before we are aware of the dif|ficulty of giving the delicacies of con|ception, and communicating the pre|ci&s;e quantity of our feelings. A re|fined writer is willing to lo&s;e &s;ome|thing of idiomatic language, to gain &s;omething of expre&s;&s;ive language.
<PB N="222" REF="246">
Some of our fine&s;t idioms become com|mon; and a writer then attempts to give an equivalent in &s;en&s;e, that may not offend by it's commonne&s;s; and this attempt, perhaps, may ri&s;e into affectation. The more poli&s;hed a lan|guage becomes, certain &s;ignificant ex|pre&s;&s;ions become ob&s;olete; and this has been a complaint of &s;ome writers who were more &s;olicitous of forcible, than of elegant expre&s;&s;ion. We are not to be cenfured too &s;everely for an occa&s;ional adoption of a foreign turn of phra&s;e; but I am &s;en&s;ible, how this permi&s;&s;ion may degenerate into licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s, with un&s;kilful writers. Bo|lingbroke, and writers about his time, abound with pure French words.</P>
<P>From the&s;e ob&s;ervations on POETI|CAL EXPRESSION, we may deduce that we are at pre&s;ent very deficient in it's diction, and that we may rea&s;on|ably &s;u&s;pect it is an un&s;urmountable difficulty. It is a misfortune attending
<PB N="223" REF="247">
the progre&s;s of art; and if it is true, that we have attained to perfection, in the poetical art, the charms of a ju|dicious novelty in diction is almo&s;t a hopele&s;s labour. It is our opulence that produces this poverty; for we may &s;ay with the ancient Romans, alluding to their numerous conque&s;ts, <Q REND="inline">"we peri&s;h, becau&s;e of our abundance."</Q></P>

<P>TWO things in human life are at continual variance; and if we cannot e&s;cape from the one, we mu&s;t be &s;epa|rated from the other; ennui and plea|&s;ure.

Sen|&s;ation is received according to the ca|pability of our organs; our organs may be almo&s;t incredibly improved by practice;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As in the in&s;tances of the blind who has a finer tact, and the jeweller who has a finer &s;ight, than other men, who are not &s;o much intere&s;ted in refining their vi&s;ion and their feeling.</NOTE> inten&s;e devotion to an ob|ject,
<PB N="239" REF="249">
mu&s;t therefore pre&s;ent means of deriving more numerous and keener plea&s;ures from that object.</P>
<P>Hence the poet, long employed on a poem, has received a quantity of plea&s;ure, which no reader can ever feel; and hence one reader receives a quantity of plea&s;ure, unfelt by ano|ther. In the progre&s;s of any particular pur&s;uit, there are a hundred delicious &s;en&s;ations, which are too intellectual, to be embodied into language. Every arti&s;t knows what uncommon combi|nations his meditations produce; and though &s;ome too imperfect, or too &s;ub|tile, re&s;i&s;t his powers of di&s;playing to the world, yet between the thought that fir&s;t gave ri&s;e to his de&s;ign, and each one which appears in it, there are innumerable intermediate evane&s;|cencies of &s;en&s;ation (&s;o to expre&s;s my|&s;elf) which no man felt but him&s;elf. The&s;e are plea&s;ures, which are in number, according to the inten&s;ene&s;s
<PB N="240" REF="250">
of his faculties, and the quantity of his labour.</P>
<P>Although the above remark alludes to works of art, I would not confine it to the&s;e pur&s;uits only; for any parti|cular pur&s;uit, from the manufacturing of pins, to the con&s;truction of philo&s;o|phical &s;y&s;tems, appears &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;imilar plea&s;ures. We &s;hall &s;ee, that every individual can exert that quan|tity of mind nece&s;&s;ary to his wants, and adapted to his &s;ituation; and that the quality of plea&s;ure is nothing in the pre&s;ent que&s;tion. For I think that we are mi&s;taken concerning the grada|tions of human felicity. It does at fir&s;t appear, that an a&s;tronomer rapt in ab|&s;traction, while he gazes on a &s;tar, mu&s;t feel a more exqui&s;ite delight, than a farmer who is conducting his team; or a poet mu&s;t experience a higher gratification in modulating ver&s;es, than a trader in arranging &s;ums. To this we may reply, that the happi|ne&s;s
<PB N="241" REF="251">
of the ploughman and the trader, may be as &s;atisfactory as that of the a&s;tronomer and the poet. Our mind can only be conver&s;ant with tho&s;e &s;en|&s;ations which &s;urround us, and po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing the &s;kill of managing them, we can form an artificial felicity; it is cer|tain, that what the &s;oul does not feel, no more affects it, than what the eye does not &s;ee. It is thus that the mean trader, habituated to low pur&s;uits, can never be unhappy, becau&s;e he is not the general of an army; for this idea of felicity he has never received. The philo&s;opher who gives his entire years to the elevated purfuits of mind, is never unhappy, becau&s;e he is not in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an Indian opulence, for the idea of accumulating this exotic &s;plendour has never entered the range of his de&s;ires. Nature, an impartial mother, renders felicity as perfect in the &s;chool-boy who &s;courges his top, as in the a&s;tronomer who regulates his
<PB N="242" REF="252">
&s;tar. The thing contained can only be equal to the container; a full gla&s;s, is as full, as a full bottle; and a hu|man &s;oul may be as much &s;atisfied, in the lowe&s;t of human beings, as in the highe&s;t.</P>
<P>In this devotion to a particular ob|ject, what philo&s;ophers call the ASSO|CIATING IDEA, exi&s;ts in all it's acti|vity and energy; and it may be ren|dered productive of the &s;en&s;ations we de&s;ire; for, when attached to one par|ticular pur&s;uit, this idea will generally point and conduct our thoughts to it. The a&s;&s;ociating power is a &s;overeign &s;eated on his throne, while all our other ideas bend towards it, and obey it's mandates. Hence the following per&s;ons experience their complete&s;t happine&s;s. A &s;tudent in the mid&s;t of his books; an arti&s;t among his pro|ductions; a farmer amid&s;t his lands; a merchant in his trade; a hor&s;eman in his menagerie; a captain in his &s;hip,
<PB N="243" REF="253">
&amp;c. The&s;e are all per&s;ons who re|&s;pectively enjoy more real felicity at tho&s;e hours, than in any other portion of their lives.</P>
<P>Many peculiar advantages attend the cultivation of one ma&s;ter pa&s;&s;ion, or occupation. In &s;uperior minds it is a &s;overeign that exiles others, and in inferior minds it enfeebles perni|cious propen&s;ities. It may render us u&s;eful to our fellow citizens, and what is of great con&s;equence, it imparts the mo&s;t perfect independance to the indi|vidual. The more al&s;o, the &s;overeign pa&s;&s;ion is compo&s;ed of intellectual gra|tifications, the more exalted and per|fect is it's independence. It is ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, by a great mathematician, that a geometrician might not be un|happy in a de&s;ert.</P>
<P>We might therefore recommend the &s;ame unity in life, which gives &s;uch a value when found in a picture or a poem. This unity of de&s;ign, with a
<PB N="244" REF="254">
centripetal force, draws all the rays of our exi&s;tence, and the more forcibly it draws, the more perfect is human fe|licity. But, if regardle&s;s of this, we yield our&s;elves to the di&s;tracting vari|ety of oppo&s;ite pur&s;uits with an equal pa&s;&s;ion, our &s;oul is placed amid&s;t a continual &s;hock of ideas, and happi|ne&s;s is lo&s;t by mi&s;takes. How often when accident has turned the mind firmly to one object, has it been di&s;co|vered that it's occupation is another name for happine&s;s; for this occupa|tion is a means of e&s;caping from in|congruous &s;en&s;ations. It &s;ecures us from the dreadful and dark vacuity of &s;oul, as well as from the terrible whirl|wind of ideas; rea&s;on it&s;elf is a pa&s;|&s;ion, but a pa&s;&s;ion full of &s;erenity.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable of tho&s;e, who have devoted them&s;elves to an individual object, that it's importance is incredi|bly enlarged to their &s;en&s;ations. In|ten&s;e attention magnifies like a micro|&s;cope;

but, it is po&s;&s;ible to apologize for their apparent extravagance from the con&s;ideration, that they really ob|&s;erve excellencies not perceived by others of inferior application.

<P>WHEN the philo&s;ophy of an age is rude, whatever excellence is pro|duced, is immediately a&s;cribed to an occult power; when men, after a lap&s;e of ages, become minuter enquirers, and calmer rea&s;oners, it is di&s;covered how much Art has entered into every great compo&s;ition; and at length, among arti&s;ts them&s;elves, it becomes a dubious point, whether <HI>art</HI> is not &s;uffi|cient to produce <HI>&s;imilar effects</HI> to <HI>genius;</HI> or in other words, whether certain combinations of art, form not genius it&s;elf.</P>
<P>We &s;till have a few writers who exult in &s;ome my&s;tical power in their faculties; who hint at the &s;olicitude of nature at their birth, and to employ the language of Milton, derived from
<PB N="249" REF="259">
the &s;uper&s;titious credulity of his age, who di&s;&s;ert with fluency, on
<Q><L>"The Stellar Virtue,"</L></Q>
which Boileau has made the fir&s;t po&s;i|tion in the <HI>art</HI> of poetry. Frail fe|males formerly denounced their &s;tars as the cau&s;e of their incontinence; and we have idlers who apologi&s;e for their defects from no lower an influ|ence; a re&s;olute love of virtue would have pre&s;erved the female cha&s;te, and a re&s;olute love of labour would have rendered the idler active.</P>
<P>While &s;ome have rejected this oc|cult influence of the &s;tars, others enjoy equal extravagancies; genius has been regulated by the degree of longitude and latitude; it has been derived from the &s;ubtilty of the blood, and even from the refinements of cookery; others &s;uppo&s;e that a writer of imagi|nation is incapable of learned re&s;earch, and that for every particular &s;tudy a peculiar con&s;truction of the intellec|tual
<PB N="250" REF="260">
powers becomes nece&s;&s;ary; that the &s;olidity of judgment impedes the vigour of fancy, and that the poet can|not inve&s;tigate nature with the eye of philo&s;ophic &s;cience.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Genius has been divided, and &s;ubdivided. There is a genius for oratory, con&s;i&s;ting of the art of moving the pa&s;&s;ions, united with the art of applying our ar|guments; a genius for phy&s;ics and geometry, when occupied in calculating the motions and action of the globes of the univer&s;e, and the whole phenomena of nature; a genius for painting and &s;culpture, when the pencil and chi&s;&s;el trace on the marble or canva&s;s the actions or the features of a hero; and the genius for poetry is &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t in the power which nature imparts by phy&s;ical &s;en&s;ibility, and a happy confor|mation of the organs to certain per&s;ons, in conceiving boldly, and delivering ea&s;ily; in painting what is &s;trongly felt, and it is, in a word, what Horace calls <HI>Splendida bilis,</HI> which we are further informed is <HI>a kind of central fire,</HI> which elevates the mind, warms the imagination, which makes one think with force, and de&s;cribe with liveline&s;s. See on this &s;ubject the <HI>Principes pour la Lecture des Poetes</HI> by the Abb&eacute; Mallet.</P>
<P>But what is gained by all the&s;e my&s;tical di&s;tinctions, this <HI>&s;plendida bilis</HI> and <HI>central fire?</HI> Are we always to take words for things? Do &s;uch critics &s;ay any thing more, than that genius, is genius? I lament that even Pope extends this &s;y&s;tem to critici&s;m; for he &s;ays of poets and critics,
<Q><L>"Both mu&s;t alike from <HI>heaven</HI> derive their light;</L>
<L>The&s;e <HI>born to judge,</HI> as well as tho&s;e to <HI>write,</HI>"</L></Q>
which is certainly contrary to experience; <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> the characteri&s;tic of critici&s;m, is now acknowledged to be obtainable by a con&s;tant attachment to the mo&s;t fini&s;hed performances of art. And when he adds,
<Q><L>"Let &s;uch teach others who them&s;elves excel;</L>
<L>And cen&s;ure freely who have written well."</L></Q>
The maxim is not le&s;s erroneous; for the be&s;t poets are not always the &s;ure&s;t critics, as in the ca&s;e of Gold&s;mith and others; and mo&s;t of the be&s;t critics have not been poets.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="261">
With chilling fancies like the&s;e, have the minds of the mo&s;t adventu|rous geniu&s;es been rendered pu&s;illani mous; and grand de&s;igns, conceived with ardent felicity, have &s;uddenly ex|pired, becau&s;e their affrighted parents refu&s;ed to fo&s;ter them with the vitality of indu&s;try. In an accompli&s;hed ge|nius, Horace, one of the mo&s;t philo|&s;ophical poets, allows that art mu&s;t be united with nature; but we probably attach different ideas to this power of nature, than the philo&s;ophy of the age of Horace allowed him to acquire. Since his time, and even in the pre&s;ent day, &s;ome regard genius as nothing &s;hort of in&s;piration, and employ, in the &s;ober di&s;qui&s;itions of philo&s;ophy, the fanciful expre&s;&s;ions of poetry. We are told, that to attain to a &s;uperiority
<PB N="252" REF="262">
in any art, we mu&s;t be <HI>born</HI> with a cer|tain <HI>&s;u&s;ceptibility,</HI> or <HI>aptitude;</HI> we mu&s;t be <HI>born</HI> a poet, or a painter; or as one painter complimented another, by &s;ay|ing, that he was a painter in his mo|ther's womb. Such are the my&s;tic re|veries &s;till indulged by the arti&s;t, who is intere&s;ted in exciting the wonder of the ignorant; but &s;uch my&s;tici&s;m is not le&s;s injurious to art, than vi&s;ionary fanatici&s;m to religion.</P>
<P>Dryden traces the whole hi&s;tory of genius in a couplet,
<Q><L>"What in nature's dawn the child <HI>admired,</HI></L>
<L>The youth <HI>endeavoured</HI> and the man ACQUIRED."</L></Q>
Yet is it not always <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> that this admiration &s;hould be felt in childhood, or in youth, &s;ince accidental cau&s;es have frequently directed the pur&s;uits of genius.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some in&s;tances are collected in Curio&s;ities of Li|terature.

<PB N="253" REF="263">
<HI>&s;timulated</HI> men to become illu&s;trious arti&s;ts.</P>
<P>In the hi&s;tory of genius we are pre|&s;ented with wider pro&s;pects, by the late attentions be&s;towed on the &s;tudies of biography. In tracing the hi&s;tory of philo&s;ophers and poets, we have traced the genius of philo&s;ophy and poetry; we have ob&s;erved that certain events produced certain con&s;equences, and why men, with an equal aptitude for genius, have not always become men of genius. Illu&s;trious characters are rare, owing to the rarity of tho&s;e human coincidencies which produce illu&s;trious characters. Man is &s;o in|fluenced by moral cau&s;es, that the per|fection of his genius is ever propor|tioned to their effects. When men of letters reflected on the manner of their own attainments, and on tho&s;e events of literary hi&s;tory which related to others, they di&s;covered that the facul|ties of the mind, are not <HI>gifts</HI> from na|ture,
<PB N="254" REF="264">
but effects from human cau&s;es, or <HI>acqui&s;itions</HI> of art,</P>
<P>Every man of common organi&s;ation has the power of becoming a man of genius, if to this be added a &s;olitary devotion to art, and a vehement pa&s;|&s;ion for glory. It is the capacity of long attention, which, in the pre&s;ent day, mu&s;t make one man &s;uperior to another. Phy&s;ical &s;en&s;ibility may vary, and defective organs cannot be &s;up|plied by any artificial mode. But in general, nature has more impartiality than &s;ome of her children will allow; and it would be very difficult to find men, who have been &s;o cruelly neg|lected by our common mother, as not to be endowed with &s;ufficient powers to excel in &s;ome particular department, when, by examining their mental &s;tores, they have the art of di&s;covering the kind of &s;tudy for which they are be&s;t adapted, and when having made this important di&s;covery, moral and
<PB N="255" REF="265">
phy&s;ical cau&s;es, are not inimical to their progre&s;s. An idiot is more rare than a man of genius.</P>
<P>The man of genius &s;hould ever exa|mine his phy&s;ical and moral &s;tate; for to ameliorate their advantages, and &s;upply their deficiencies, are of the greate&s;t con&s;equence to his &s;ucce&s;s. A defect in phy&s;ical &s;en&s;ibility, will di&s;order &s;ome portion of genius; and the purblind eye of John&s;on, which denied him the ta&s;te for picture&s;que beauty, occa&s;ioned much erroneous critici&s;m, without, however, dimini&s;h|ing his <HI>acquired</HI> faculties, on topics where this &s;en&s;ibility was not requi&s;ite. Defects in the moral &s;tate are innume|rable; &s;ometimes they contract, &s;ome|times they enfeeble, and &s;ometimes they annihilate genius. Shen&s;tone, who devoted his days to poetry, equally with Pope, could never reach his pow|ers. But was his life not a &s;eries of di&s;content and li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s; ever inca|pable
<PB N="256" REF="266">
of energy, and often &s;inking into torpidity? Without the vigour of hope, and without the exhilaration of enjoyment. Pope on the contrary was fortunate in every circum&s;tance of early friend&s;hips, of augmenting indepen|dence, and of that continued fervour of di&s;po&s;ition, which cheri&s;hed by pa|tronage, knows no pau&s;e till the re|mote&s;t excellence is gra&s;ped. In other circum&s;tances Dryden might have proved &s;uperior to Pope, and Otway had equalled Shake&s;peare. It is a mo&s;t judicious ob&s;ervation made by Helve|tius, that it is not &s;ufficient to po&s;&s;e&s;s genius, to obtain it's title. One di&s;|covers, another improves, a third ac|compli&s;hes, and this la&s;t is &s;aluted as the genius; although he has really not advanced the art, <HI>in a greater proportion,</HI> than his le&s;s fortunate predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>All that the fine&s;t organi&s;ation can impart in the pre&s;ent day, will never form one work of genius. The mere
<PB N="257" REF="267">
natural produce, of the mo&s;t fertile in|dividual, will now be only a pitiable indigence; for the opulence of the mind can now only be formed by &s;tor|ing it with acquired knowledge; and the mo&s;t valuable productions will be tho&s;e in which the indu&s;try of the mind has been mo&s;t vigilantly exerci&s;ed. The re&s;ult of what we u&s;ually term <HI>natural abilities,</HI> will re&s;emble the haws and berries which our ancient Britons might have con&s;idered as excellent fruit, but a modern Briton knows that the richne&s;s of our orchards has been borrowed from all the varieties of cli|mate. Hence, pertinacity of medita|tion, becomes a commerce of the mind; it a&s;&s;embles and combines the ideas of others, but the &s;en&s;ations it experiences are it's own. We <HI>learn</HI> to think, by being conver&s;ant with the thoughts of others; but this is denied, &s;ince it is a&s;&s;erted that the thoughts of others encumber our own. He, how|ever,
<PB N="258" REF="268">
who is not familiari&s;ed with the fine&s;t thoughts of the fine&s;t writers, will one day be mortified to ob&s;erve, that his be&s;t thoughts are their indif|ferent ones. Nature re&s;pects a certain progre&s;&s;ion; &s;he expands by a gradual amplification; &s;he makes no leaps. But he who fondly dotes on what he terms his <HI>natural powers,</HI> audaciou&s;ly imagines, that alone he can arrive at that point of knowledge, attained by the fraternal labours of the mo&s;t emi|nent geniu&s;es. To think with think|ing men, is to run with agile racers. But as this is not always attended to, we abound with writers who are far removed from an excellence they <HI>could</HI> have <HI>acquired;</HI> as he who, accu&s;tomed to run in a &s;olitary cour&s;e, felicitated him&s;elf as being one of the fir&s;t racers, but received the public deri&s;ion when he pre&s;ented him&s;elf at the Olympic games.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="269">
In meditating on the characters, the modes of life, the &s;low formation, and the painful vigilance of &s;ome great writers, I have been of opinion, that their con&s;picuous labours, were the gradual acqui&s;itions of <HI>art.</HI> Of the&s;e writers many have acknowledged that they could produce nothing valuable till a flame, caught by contact, had lighted up their minds; they re&s;emble certain trees, which, though they could produce no valuable fruit of them&s;elves, are excellent for grafting on. The minds, of &s;uch writers, are like a globe of gla&s;s, which, when ra|pidly revolved, and the hand applied to it's &s;urface, will grow warm, emit light, and attract bodies. Among this cla&s;s of writers, we might place Boi|leau and Racine; Pope and Gray; Aken&s;ide and Arm&s;trong; Monte&s;|quieu and John&s;on. When Boileau a&s;ked Chapelle, a facile natural writer, an opinion of his poetry, Chapelle
<PB N="260" REF="270">
made this &s;arca&s;tic compari&s;on&mdash;You are a great ox, who, labouring &s;lowly and painfully, make a deep furrow. Boileau has him&s;elf admirably de&s;cri|bed this act of the ox, and I &s;hall ap|ply it to writers who re&s;emble him.

<P>The French appear to have formed this di&s;tinction between great writers. They call Corneille, <HI>un homme de Genie,</HI> and Racine, <HI>un homme d' E&s;prit.</HI> The latter kind of writers are the more agreeable; for though they never &s;ur|pa&s;s the former, yet they are rarely inferior, and can more happily adapt them&s;elves to a variety of topics. Men of genius have &s;tronger but more con|fined faculties.</P>
<P>The natural facility which &s;ome wri|ters appear to po&s;&s;e&s;s, forms no diffi|culty
<PB N="261" REF="271">
to this &s;y&s;tem. Such authors as a Fielding and a Gold&s;mith, a Sheri|dan and a Wolcot, are not &s;uppo&s;ed to have overwhelmed their minds by extraneous &s;tudies; and &s;uch wri|ters are often even very illiterate. They addre&s;s them&s;elves to the heart, and not to the head. But &s;till from <HI>indu&s;try,</HI> and pertinacity of attention, is their rapidity of combination de|rived; and not from what marvelling ignorance &s;ometimes regards as in&s;pi|ration or organi&s;ation. They have given a &s;trong direction to their mind, in the great &s;y&s;tem of human life; they therefore excel in that point, though they may be, and generally are, defi|cient in other literary qualities; for we &s;hall always find that no man can know what he has not learnt, or know that &s;uddenly which requires an habi|tual attention.</P>
<P>And indeed, if we attend to the pre|cious ob&s;ervations of tho&s;e who have
<PB N="262" REF="272">
excelled in art or &s;cience, we &s;hall hear of no romance of original powers, no in&s;pirations from nature, no divine impul&s;e that creates a world, at a word. The painter di&s;covers that it is long before the pencil accompli&s;hes tho&s;e beauties which he has long me|ditated, and the poet that he con&s;umes many years in ver&s;e, before a great poem is even attempted. The follow|ing facts trace the progre&s;&s;ive powers of genius. Reynolds painted many hours every day during the long &s;pace of thirty years; Gold&s;mith compo&s;ed his poems by &s;low and laborious ef|forts, and they are the fini&s;hed pro|ductions of &s;everal years. Churchill was a ver&s;ifier at fifteen, but was not known as a poet till after thirty. Sterne, who read at lea&s;t as much as he thought, was not an <HI>original</HI> genius till at a late period of life. Addi&s;on, before he commenced his Spectators, had ama&s;&s;ed materials with the a&s;&s;idu|ity
<PB N="263" REF="273">
of a &s;tudent.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Young, in his poetical Epi&s;tle to Tickle, allu|ding to Addi&s;on's Spectators, &s;ays,
<Q><L>"<HI>A chance amu&s;ement</HI> poli&s;hed half an age."</L></Q>
But it has been &s;ince di&s;covered, that the rever&s;e is the fact; for Addi&s;on had collected his materials to the amount of <HI>three folio volumes.</HI> The commentator of the la&s;t edition of the Spectators gives this in&s;truc|tive information.</NOTE> The immortal work of Monte&s;quieu was the beloved oc|cupation of twenty years; the wit of Butler was not extemporaneous, but painfully elaborated from notes which he ince&s;&s;antly accumulated. And to clo&s;e our te&s;timonies, the Emi|lius of Rou&s;&s;eau was the fruit, to em|ploy the writer's own energetic lan|guage, of twenty years meditation, and of three years compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Among the advocates of our pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem, we rank the fir&s;t geniu&s;es of the age. John&s;on, Helvetius, and Reynolds, have cea&s;ele&s;sly enforced it's principles, have compo&s;ed in the ar|dour of conviction, and have given &s;tability to the beautiful &s;tructure they erected by the ma&s;&s;ine&s;s of demon&s;tra|tion.
<PB N="264" REF="274">
Authorities from periods more remote, are not wanting; Quintilian and Locke con&s;ider men to have an equal aptitude to mental capacity, and Pa&s;cal &s;ays, that what is called na|ture, is only our fir&s;t habit; but what &s;everal great men have di&s;cerned con|fu&s;edly through a mi&s;t, tho&s;e who com|po&s;ed in a happier age, have viewed in the &s;un&s;hine of biography.</P>
<P>In the Di&s;cour&s;es of Reynolds, this principle is laid down as the founda|tion of all excellence in art. The pre|&s;ident expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in this man|ner. <Q REND="inline">"Not to enter into metaphy&s;ical di&s;cu&s;&s;ions on the nature and e&s;&s;ence of <HI>genius,</HI> I will venture to a&s;&s;ert, that <HI>a&s;&s;iduity,</HI> unabated by difficulty, and a <HI>di&s;po&s;ition</HI> eagerly directed to the object of it's pur&s;uit, will produce effects &s;imilar to tho&s;e which &s;ome call the re&s;ult of <HI>natural powers.</HI>"</Q> The opinion of John&s;on not only appears in his conver&s;ations, but in his compo&s;itions;
<PB N="265" REF="275">
he has touched on this topic in the twenty-fifth and forty-third Ramblers, and in the per&s;on of Imlach, we are in&s;tructed, that when he <HI>re&s;olved</HI> to <HI>make</HI> him&s;elf a poet, he tells us that <Q REND="inline">"he &s;aw every thing with a new pur|po&s;e."</Q> The entire work of L'E&s;prit of Helvetius inculcates the &s;ame prin|ciples.</P>
<P>On this delicate topic I &s;hall hazard the following rapid glance. In the rude periods of &s;ociety, when a writer can have but few predece&s;&s;ors, he will pour forth, what Milton elegantly and &s;weetly terms <Q REND="inline">"Virgin Fancies."</Q> He mu&s;t then meditate on the great ori|ginal nature; the impre&s;&s;ions mu&s;t be vivid, though rude, and the combi|nations novel, though wild. Some, who&s;e phy&s;ical &s;en&s;ibility, improved by imperceptible habit, may receive &s;en&s;ations more lively than others, will exerci&s;e a facility and celerity of con|ception apparently &s;upernatural to the
<PB N="266" REF="276">
vulgar and the ignorant. In the latter cla&s;s even the highe&s;t minds mu&s;t then be ranked; and it is not improbable that the arti&s;t him&s;elf is not le&s;s per|&s;uaded than his admirers, that he is agitated by a certain impul&s;e, and that his performances could not be pro|duced by human means. <HI>E&s;t Deus in Nobis,</HI> exclaims the &s;elf wondering Ovid, at a later period indeed, but when the philo&s;ophy of the mind had made but little progre&s;s. Hence the origin of that fanciful interpo&s;ition of nature in the ca&s;e of men of genius; and it is then that poets are regarded as prophets, and philo&s;ophers as ma|gicians.</P>
<P>The Monki&s;h ages blended many of the ab&s;urdities of polythei&s;m with their peculiar ones; and it was in this pe|riod, Era&s;mus informs us, that that gothic adage was formed worthy of Monki&s;h ta&s;te, and Monki&s;h credulity; <HI>poeta na&s;citur, non fit;</HI> which an excel|lent
<PB N="267" REF="277">
judge of poetry contradicts, by af|firming, that a poet may be <HI>made,</HI> as well as <HI>born.</HI> But a great revolution appears in the world of ta&s;te; the flame of inve&s;tigation ri&s;es gradually in the mo&s;t &s;ecret retirements of nature. She comes, in all her &s;implicity, and all her &s;olitary maje&s;ty, unaccompa|nied by the adventitious &s;plendour of fancy, the grote&s;que chimeras of a&s;to|ni&s;hment, and the terrific forms of &s;u|per&s;tition. When we under&s;tand na|ture, what becomes of apparitions, of witchery, of prophecy, and the in&s;pi|ration of genius?</P>
<P>Genius may now be divided into an enthu&s;ia&s;m caught from nature, and an enthu&s;ia&s;m received from art.</P>
<P>The enthu&s;ia&s;m from nature is di&s;|tingui&s;hed by it's facility, celerity, and vividne&s;s; &s;ufficient to form an ardent effu&s;ion in the early periods of &s;ociety. Such are the relicks of all antient poetry. But as the &s;phere of poetical
<PB N="268" REF="278">
invention mu&s;t then be very circum|&s;cribed, we ob&s;erve, in &s;uch compo|&s;itions, a recurrence of the &s;ame ob|jects and the &s;ame ideas. Man <HI>creates</HI> by <HI>imitation;</HI> but he creates little in the infancy of &s;ociety, becau&s;e he has &s;carcely any thing to imitate. When we examine the effu&s;ions of the Bards, the wild poetry of the Indians, and even O&s;&s;ian, who probably has re|ceived many modern embelli&s;hments, we perceive that paucity of ideas, which mu&s;t be natural at this period of &s;ociety.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Homer mu&s;t not be quoted as an example of the enthu&s;ia&s;m from nature; nor can he be con&s;idered as the mo&s;t original, becau&s;e he is the mo&s;t ancient of our cla&s;&s;ic poets. We are told, that &s;carce any &s;pe|cies of learning was unknown to him; and it is pro|bable that the Maeonian was not more original than his imitator the Mantuan, and that his immortal la|bours were compo&s;ed with an enthu&s;ia&s;m from art, as well as from nature.</NOTE></P>
<P>This enthu&s;ia&s;m from nature dimi|ni&s;hes in the progre&s;s of refinement. Arti&s;ts not infrequently complain that nature is nearly exhau&s;ted, and not
<PB N="269" REF="279">
without rea&s;on; for it would, perhaps, a&s;toni&s;h &s;ome, if they were &s;hown how very few <HI>original</HI> notions form the great trea&s;ury of human invention. Nature is regular in her grand characteri&s;tics. She is ever the &s;ame univer&s;al power; but in the progre&s;s of &s;ociety, a great variation obtains in the human pa&s;|&s;ions. We all think alike on certain objects in their general conception, but mo&s;t think differently in their in|dividual examination; hence critici&s;m has ob&s;erved, that the beauties of art are &s;ometimes local, and &s;ometimes univer&s;al. But not to wander into metaphy&s;ical di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, we may re|mark, that pure nature will di&s;gu&s;t by it's obviou&s;ne&s;s and it's facility; ele|gance, the characteri&s;tic of refinement, means a &s;election, and, at this period we di&s;gui&s;e and rai&s;e the offen&s;ive rudene&s;s of truth, by the attractive graces of veri&s;imilitude. A noble &s;en|timent occupies the &s;oul of the arti&s;t,
<PB N="270" REF="280">
and he toils after an ideal perfection. The riche&s;t combinations throw their dazzling light on his imagination; emulation rivals and &s;urpa&s;&s;es; in this glorious &s;trife, individual is oppo&s;ed to individual, and people to people. Our galleries are filled with pictures, and our libraries with poems.</P>
<P>A diver&s;ity of genius becomes more di&s;tingui&s;hable, as ta&s;te becomes more exqui&s;ite. One kind is peculiar to this age; the genius of &s;everal can now be made to produce an original one. A &s;tudent, to borrow an expre&s;&s;ion from chemi&s;try, amalgamates the character|i&s;tics of preceding ma&s;ters. The hi&s;|tory of the orders in architecture, is the hi&s;tory of genius. We have the &s;evere Tu&s;can, the cha&s;te Doric, the elegant Ionic, the light Corinthian, and at length appears the Compo&s;ite uniting the&s;e varieties.</P>

<HEAD>ON LITERARY INDUSTRY.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN youthful genius meditates on a great compo&s;ition, he does not u&s;ually reflect on the mode of it's per|formance; his de&s;pair is equal to his admiration; and there is danger that he may re&s;emble the young arithmeti|cian, who re&s;igned his art, becau&s;e in the fir&s;t le&s;&s;ons, he had ob&s;erved the total amount of an immen&s;e &s;eries, which he could not &s;uppo&s;e he was <HI>born</HI> to comprehend.</P>
<P>If a Savage wandering in his woods, accu&s;tomed to no other habitation than his dark cave, or ill-con&s;tructed hovel, &s;hould di&s;cover an edifice, con|&s;iderable in it's magnitude, and regu|lar in it's arrangement, he would im|mediately conclude that it was the re|&s;idence of a divine being, con&s;tructed
<PB N="277" REF="287">
by divine power. He would con&s;ider that no human hand could rai&s;e the columns, and no human de&s;ign could invent an order &s;o beautiful. If the Savage, however, becomes in&s;tructed, he di&s;covers that it's author was a be|ing of his own &s;pecies, that the hand which erected, was &s;uperior in &s;kill, but not in &s;trength, to his own; and that if he would &s;ubmit to the &s;ame directions which conducted the other, he might him&s;elf be capable of pro|ducing a &s;imilar compo&s;ition. This Savage is the unreflecting reader, or that &s;imple youth, who&s;e admiration clo&s;es with de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Few works of magnitude pre&s;ented them&s;elves at once in full extent, to their authors; patiently were they examined, and in&s;en&s;ibly were they formed. We often ob&s;erve this cir|cum&s;tance noticed in their prefaces. Writers have propo&s;ed to them&s;elves a little piece of two acts, and the farce
<PB N="278" REF="288">
has become a comedy of five; an e&s;&s;ay &s;wells into a treati&s;e, and a treati&s;e into volumes.</P>
<P>Let us trace the progre&s;&s;ion of the mind in the formation of it's &s;pecula|tions. At the fir&s;t glance a man of genius throws around a &s;ubject, he perceives not more than one or two &s;triking circum&s;tances, unob&s;erved by another. As he revolves the &s;ubject, the whole mind is gradually agitated, and it is then, that acquiring force by exertion, he di&s;covers talents that he knew not he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. At fir&s;t he &s;aw (except the few leading objects which invited his contemplation) every thing dimly; to the &s;tudious eye of genius, every thing becomes orderly and di&s;|tinct; the twilight gradually di&s;per&s;es, and every form &s;hines in the brilliant light of imagination. It is then he is excur&s;ive and unweary; it is then that all is beauty to his eye, all is har|mony to his ear. It is like viewing a
<PB N="279" REF="289">
land&s;cape at an early hour in a &s;um|mer morning; the ri&s;ing &s;un perhaps only re&s;ts on a particular object, and the &s;cene is wrapt in mi&s;t; as the hight and warmth increa&s;e, the mi&s;ts fade, and the &s;cene a&s;&s;umes it's varied charms.</P>
<P>Such is the feeblene&s;s of human fa|culties, that, it is probable, if they could perceive at the fir&s;t view the whole of the &s;ubject, they would re|main inert in indolence, and reject with de&s;pondence it's final accompli&s;h|ment. In the preceding e&s;&s;ay we have ob&s;erved that the greate&s;t works have been in&s;en&s;ibly formed; and to prove that the &s;lighte&s;t conceptions may &s;erve for the leading circum&s;tances of even works of magnitude, I &s;hall notice three modern compo&s;itions of great and kindred merit. That exqui&s;ite poem, Les Jardins of the Abb&eacute; de Lille, derives it's exi&s;tence from the &s;imple circum&s;tance of a lady a&s;king
<PB N="280" REF="290">
for a few ver&s;es on rural topics. His &s;pecimens plea&s;ed, and the poet, ani|mated by a &s;mile, heaped &s;ketches on &s;ketches, till he found him&s;elf ena|bled to weave them into a concording whole, which forms one of the fine&s;t didactic poems in the language. "The botanic garden" was at fir&s;t only a few loo&s;e de&s;criptions of flowers, which ca&s;ually excited the poet's philo&s;ophi|cal curio&s;ity; and we have only to la|ment that the Engli&s;h bard wanted the addre&s;s, or the indu&s;try of the French poet: A deficiency of inte|re&s;ting order is the radical defect of that compo&s;ition. "The plea&s;ures of memory" was the &s;low and perfect pro|duction of ten years; the poet at fir&s;t propo&s;ed a &s;imple de&s;cription in a few lines, but imperceptibly conducted by his meditations, from the&s;e few ver&s;es, was at length compo&s;ed a poem, im|portant alike for it's extent, it's inve&s;|tigation, and it's beauty. Similar cir|cum&s;tances
<PB N="281" REF="291">
gave the origin of the Lu|trin; and the Dunciad is an amplifica|tion of the Mac Flecnoe of Dryden. The Henriade of Voltaire was at fir&s;t only intended for a poem on the League, and it's want of unity of de&s;ign, as an epic, aro&s;e from this circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>MEDITATION may be defined the <HI>indu&s;try of the mind.</HI> On it's habitual exertion depend all our great efforts; for literary indu&s;try to obtain it's pur|po&s;e mu&s;t become habitual. It is then, whereever we go, whatever we &s;ee, from what we read, and what we hear, &s;ome acqui&s;itions are brought to adorn our favourite topics. I am much plea&s;ed, and much in&s;tructed, by that anecdote of an ancient general, who, in the profounde&s;t peace, practi|&s;ed &s;tratagems of war, and when walk|ing with his friends, and arriving at &s;ome remarkable &s;pot, was accu&s;tomed to con&s;ult with them, on a mode of defence or attack. Hence he derived
<PB N="282" REF="292">
the rare talent of ever being accompa|nied by his genius, and to this general the victories of war were obtained by the labours of peace. The great poet, and the great painter, are alike intent on their re&s;pective objects; and do, no le&s;s than this general, pa&s;s their remarkable &s;pots, without bringing home &s;entiments and images, forms and colours.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t works have been de|rived from petty commencements, and always formed by &s;low and gradual re|novations of indu&s;try. Indu&s;try, in|deed, is but a mean word, and ap|pears more appropriate to mechanical labours, than to the operations of ge|nius. If genius is to be con&s;idered as in&s;piration, the philo&s;ophers of this li|terary age will acknowledge that we have produced no works of genius; and that even the livelie&s;t conceptions of our poets are rarely formed by that celerity, and fury, which &s;ome are yet
<PB N="283" REF="293">
&s;o credulous, and &s;o ignorant as to &s;uppo&s;e. The manu&s;cripts of one of our mo&s;t <HI>original</HI> living bards, would a&s;toni&s;h &s;ome of his admirers by their numerous ra&s;ures; but every blot on them is like the artful patches on the face of a beauty, which improve it's charms. The indu&s;try which we are now to under&s;tand, re&s;embles, but little, mechanical a&s;&s;iduity; it is a continued exerci&s;e of the noble&s;t faculties, which expand as they are u&s;ed; a re&s;olute intellectual labour; a combination of many means to obtain one end. It is &s;tudy invigorated by meditation; it is critici&s;m, which, if we may &s;o expre&s;s our&s;elves, is a continuation or &s;upple|ment of the &s;pirit of the original au|thor. This indu&s;try is that art, which &s;ei&s;es, as if it were by the rapidity of in&s;piration, whatever it di&s;covers in the works of others, which may en|rich it's own &s;tores; which knows by a quick apprehen&s;ion, what to exa|mine
<PB N="284" REF="294">
and what to imbibe; and which receives an atom of intelligence, from the minds of others on it's own mind, as an accidental &s;park falling on a heap of nitre, is &s;u&s;&s;icient to rai&s;e a powerful blaze.</P>
<P>If we look into literary biography, we perceive that every illu&s;trious wri|ter, in one mode or another, was an indefatigable &s;tudent. Tillot&s;on ob|&s;erves, that whenever the ancient hi&s;|torians de&s;cribe an eminent character, they ever employ the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, that he was <HI>incredibili indu&s;tria, diligentia &s;ingulari.</HI> Cicero and Pliny, to habi|tuate them&s;elves to the graces of the Grecian writers, even at a remote pe|riod of life, practi&s;ed the labours of tran&s;lation; and there was no mode or art they omitted proper for correction. They read their work to a few friends, they recited it to an audience, and even &s;ent it to their di&s;tant friends for emendation. This unwearied zeal has
<PB N="285" REF="295">
rendered their works immortal, and capable of equalling whatever the am|bition of the moderns can oppo&s;e. Voltaire, lively as he may appear, was an indefatigable &s;tudent, and never read, even at the clo&s;e of life, without a pen in his hand. The immortal and voluminous labours of the philo&s;ophic Buffon, are derived from the &s;imple circum&s;tance of early ri&s;ing; he long &s;trove again&s;t a natural indulgence of ea&s;e, and u&s;ed &s;evere precautions. It is not I who attribute his works to this petty circum&s;tance, it is him&s;elf. The mo&s;t original genius of this age, car|ries a little book for hints, for hemi&s;|ticks, and any occa&s;ional ob&s;ervation. which may &s;tart in all it's warmth from the in&s;pection of a pre&s;ent object. Perhaps no &s;tudent was more labori|ous than Milton, and his indu&s;try was even equal to his genius. Ob&s;erve the mode&s;t and remarkable expre&s;&s;ion he employs, in one of his pro&s;e works,
<PB N="286" REF="296">
alluding to his intention of compo&s;ing an epic. After mentioning Ta&s;&s;o, he adds, <Q REND="inline">"It haply would be no ra&s;hne&s;s from an <HI>equal diligence</HI> and <HI>inclination</HI> to pre&s;ent the like."</Q> Such was the vigi|lant indu&s;try of Pope, that he appears to have derived his genius from this characteri&s;tic.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations will hold through all ages, and &s;till more in ages of re|finement, than in the earlier periods of &s;ociety; for it is a truth of &s;ome im|portance in literature to be known, that the farther progre&s;s we make in knowledge, renders &s;tudy more nece&s;|&s;ary; that as ta&s;te is more refined, la|bour becomes more e&s;&s;ential; and that however modern writers mu&s;t lo&s;e &s;omething of originality, they have, even if their &s;ubject is preocoupied, more difficulties to overcome, more art to di&s;play, more labour to exerci&s;e, more novelty to court, than their ance&s;tors, who wrote with the licentious &s;pirit of
<PB N="287" REF="297">
their age; and who, though not &s;upe|rior in point of courage, handled their pen with a ferocity, not permitted to their more poli&s;hed de&s;cendants.</P>

<HEAD>ON THE INFLUENCE OF CLIMATE ON THE HUMAN MIND.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the follies of the wi&s;e, may be ranked that &s;y&s;tem which cir|cum&s;cribes the energies of the human mind, by the influence of climate. It has been confuted, and is &s;till believed, for there are &s;ome whom no confuta|tions can confute. We &s;hall form an enquiry into it's origin, with &s;ome no|tices of that fanciful chain it has thrown over the intellects of the mo&s;t vigorous geniu&s;es, and we &s;hall incul|cate the independence of the intellec|tual powers.</P>
<P>This extravagant &s;y&s;tem derives it's modern rejuvene&s;cence from a writer who&s;e talents are the mo&s;t brilliant and &s;eductive, modern literature di&s;|plays. Monte&s;quieu, ever vigilant in
<PB N="289" REF="299">
&s;triking the mind by novelties, di&s;co|vered in the writings of &s;ome of the ancients, a few fanciful and ca&s;ual conjectures on the influence of climate on the human mind, and which he al&s;o extended to manners. Curious ab&s;ur|dities, not le&s;s eccentric, remain yet for &s;ome future Monte&s;quieu to adopt. The&s;e &s;light conjectures he &s;eized with avidity, amplified with ingenuity, de corated by the graces of fancy, and divulged with the triumphant air of a modern di&s;covery.</P>
<P>Baillet, who wrote at the clo&s;e of the la&s;t century, without a &s;olitary charm of Monte&s;quieu's fancy, was well acquainted with this extravagant notion. It is probable, that to this compiler Monte&s;quieu, with &s;ome kin|dred geniu&s;es, were indebted for the &s;eminal heat of all their variegated flowers. In his volume on National Prejudices, he adverts to this &s;y&s;tem, and quotes Hippocrates, Plato, Ari&s;|totle,
<PB N="290" REF="300">
Seneca, and others, who had conceived that the temperature of the air contributes &s;omething to the natu|ral di&s;po&s;itions of the mind. Long an|terior to Monte&s;quieu, our own Mil|ton expre&s;&s;ed this prejudice;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is curious to ob&s;erve, that Spen&s;er, that child of fancy, had on this &s;ubject, a &s;ounder philo&s;ophy than Milton. I allude to his View of the State of Ireland; it is compo&s;ed in the dialogue manner, and one of the &s;peakers conceives that the barbarity of that country proceeds from the very <HI>genius</HI> of the <HI>&s;oil,</HI> or <HI>influence</HI> of the <HI>&s;tars.</HI> But he is ju&s;tly reprimanded by the other, in expre&s;&s;ions &s;o philo&s;ophical and plea|&s;ing, that I &s;hall tran&s;cribe them, <Q REND="inline">"Surely, I &s;up|po&s;e this but a vain conceit of <HI>&s;imple men,</HI> which <HI>judge things</HI> by their <HI>effects,</HI> and not by their <HI>cau&s;es;</HI> for I would rather think the cau&s;e of this evil which hangeth upon that country, to proceed rather of the un&s;oundne&s;s of the coun&s;els, and plots which you &s;ay have been oftentimes laid for the reformation, or of faintne&s;s in following and effecting the &s;ame, than of any &s;uch fatal cour&s;e appointed of God, as you mi&s;deem; but <HI>it is the manner of men, that when they are fallen into any ab&s;urdity,</HI> or <HI>their actions &s;ucceed not as they would, they are always ready to impute the blame thereof unto the heavens, &s;o to excu&s;e their own follies</HI> and <HI>imperfections.</HI>"</Q> The admirable Spen&s;er is another in&s;tance to prove that an exqui&s;ite imagina|tion may be combined with the &s;ounde&s;t intellect; and it is now, perhaps, the fir&s;t time that Spen&s;er the poet, has been quoted as Spen&s;er the philo&s;opher.</NOTE> and as Filangieri ob&s;erves, Chardin, Fonte|nelle, Du Bos, and others, had ex|plained
<PB N="291" REF="301">
and adopted the notion. But what the rea&s;oning of Chardin, the wit of Fontenelle, and the ingenuity of Du Bos, failed to e&s;tabli&s;h, was fixed by the &s;eductive eloquence of Monte&s;quieu. His brilliant &s;trokes dazzled the eyes of Europe, and iced, with an additional fro&s;t, the heart of many a literary Ru&s;&s;ian and Dane. It is thus follies are hereditary among writers, and one generation perpetu|ates or revives the extinct follies of another.</P>
<P>It was the talent of exqui&s;ite com|po&s;ition that gave to Monte&s;quieu the power of di&s;gui&s;ing an exploded the|ory. Who can re&s;i&s;t &s;uch poignant epigrams as the&s;e, allowing that every lively epigram is a conclu&s;ive argu|ment?&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"The empire of climate is the fir&s;t of all empires."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"As we di&s;tin|gui&s;h climates by degrees of latitude, we might di&s;tingui&s;h them, thus to expre&s;s my&s;elf, by degrees of &s;en&s;ibi|lity."</Q>

We &s;uffer our follies to become agreeable, when we &s;uffer them to become fa|miliar.</P>
<P>When the "Spirit of laws" was fir&s;t publi&s;hed, every literary centinel did not &s;ilently admit the enemy of intel|lectual freedom, nor was every genius rendered &s;omniferous by the corrup|tions of wit. The alarm was given. This paradox kindled the philo&s;ophic indignation of Gray, and in&s;pired his exqui&s;ite mu&s;e to commence a poem of con&s;iderable magnitude, de&s;igned to combat a po&s;ition &s;o fatal to intel|lectual exertion. Churchill revolted from the degrading notion; a line on genius conveys his idea, that it is not

Arm&s;trong found it nece&s;&s;ary to in|veigh with &s;arca&s;tic acerbity again&s;t this &s;y&s;tem; but it was the philo&s;o|phic Hume, who with &s;olid arguments cru&s;hed the brilliant epigrams of Mon|te&s;quieu.</P>
<P>Filangieri,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Filangieri's Science of Legi&s;lation has been tran&s;|lated, and commented on, by Mr. Kendall, with &s;uch energy of &s;tyle, that it affords the plea&s;ure of an original performance.</NOTE> who had all the advan|tage of po&s;terior knowledge, united to an inve&s;tigating genius, has marched between the&s;e &s;y&s;temati&s;ers and their adver&s;aries, by attempting to &s;hew that Climate influences the mind as a relative, not as an ab&s;olute cau&s;e, and that the difference is not perceptible in temperate climates.

<P>As France is a very exten&s;ive coun|try, and has great variation of climate, it offered an ample circuit for the&s;e &s;y&s;temati&s;ers to verify their favourite po&s;itions, by tracing the effects of cli|mate through that diver&s;ified country. The inhabitants of Picardy being placed in a colder &s;ituation than the other provinces, were imagined to be eminent for their indefatigable labour, and their writers were &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;tudents of great erudition. But here, as almo&s;t in every in&s;tance, where facts
<PB N="295" REF="305">
are produced to confirm this fanci|ful theory, we &s;hall find that moral are often taken for phy&s;ical effects. Baillet remarks on this ob&s;ervation concerning Picardy, that the indu&s;try of it's writers is owing to tho&s;e deva&s;|tations of war, which, having injured the fortunes of the natives, induced them rather to apply to u&s;eful than to agreeable compo&s;itions, as a means of ameliorating their fortune. Normandy having great inequality of climate, was &s;uppo&s;ed to occa&s;ion a &s;imilar inequal|ity in the literary productions of it's authors; and Auvergne having high mountains and deep vallies, was con|jectured to produce both men of great genius and great dullne&s;s; for tho&s;e born on the mountains were &s;aid to have more delicate organs, and a more aetherial &s;pirit, than the gro&s;s and &s;tu|pid &s;tudents of the valleys.

<P>But if an Engli&s;hman is amu&s;ed by the&s;e airy fancies, he will come at length to re&s;ent, with a due &s;pirit of in|dignation, the national attacks which the&s;e fanta&s;tic &s;y&s;temati&s;ers have con|&s;tantly levelled at our country.

The cla&s;&s;ics of England exhibit models of the pure&s;t ta&s;te to literary Europe; but moral cau&s;es long impeded the progre&s;s of ta&s;te in our country; when individuals want patronage, they often want genius; our monarchs have been torpid and par&s;imonious, but our pub|lic

at length has been rapid and mag|nificent. We may re&s;ound our tri|umphs to the manes of Du Bos,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This writer conceives, that a difference of talents in the &s;ame people, in different ages, is to be a&s;cribed to &s;ome <HI>variation of their climate!</HI></NOTE> of Monte&s;quieu, and Winckelman, who have affirmed that we could have no genius for the fine arts, becau&s;e they informed the world that the &s;en&s;ibility of ta&s;te was ob&s;tructed by an obnox|ious clime. Such are the &s;entiments which have been echoed from one writer to another, till even &s;ome of our own have been plea&s;ed to calum|niate them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Among many curious critici&s;ms of foreigners, I mu&s;t not pa&s;s &s;ilently Winckelman's notion concerning Mil|ton. He tells us, that all the de&s;crip|tions in the Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, excepting the amorous and delicate &s;cenes of the primeval pair, are like well-painted gorgons, which re&s;emble each other, but are always frightful; and this he

attributes to the climate. But what is here attempted to be depreciated, every critic of ta&s;te will conceive to be the terrible graces of a &s;ublime po|e&s;y; a &s;ublimity (the grande&s;t charac|teri&s;tic of a poet) unrivalled in modern or in ancient times. As the &s;ubject is peculiar, and of the mo&s;t elevated na|ture, &s;o it found in Milton a genius as peculiar, and faculties the mo&s;t ele|vated. If the Engli&s;h Mu&s;e has &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed her &s;i&s;ters in loftine&s;s, &s;he yields not in the more delicate and &s;weeter portions of her art. Of late we have excelled in picture&s;que de&s;cription; the mo&s;t plea&s;ing paintings of nature variegate the ver&s;e of Thom&s;on, who, as a &s;hrewd ob&s;erver remarks, was born more northerly than Milton. Gold&s;mith has cultivated the &s;ame powers, and they have proved &s;o at|tractive to the public ta&s;te, that Eng|li&s;h ver&s;e can now exhibit &s;ome of the mo&s;t exchanting and the mo&s;t vivid

&s;cenery in poetry.

<P>Men of genius cea&s;e to be &s;uch, when like the common people, they precipitate them&s;elves on one another with the &s;tupid docility of a flock of &s;heep, who follow the one who hap|pens to be the foremo&s;t. Writers have yielded up their &s;en&s;ations and their reflections to this favourite theory. Spence has accounted for the turgidity of Lucan, on the principles of this &s;y&s;tem. He &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"The &s;wellings in his poem may be partly accounted for, perhaps, from his being <HI>born</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> and in that part of it which was <HI>farthe&s;t removed</HI> from Greece and Rome."</Q> But the following in&s;tance will parallel any

literary extravagance. When Dyer gave the "Fleece," he acquainted the world, to apologize for the defects of the poem, that <Q REND="inline">"It was publi&s;hed un|der &s;ome <HI>di&s;advantages;</HI> for many of it's <HI>faults</HI> mu&s;t be imputed to the <HI>air of a fenny country,</HI> where I have been for the mo&s;t part above the&s;e five years."</Q> Such critici&s;ms remind me of a couplet of the ingenious De Foe, who&s;e good &s;en&s;e appears al&s;o to have wandered wildly into the&s;e fancies.

It is evident, that when Milton fir&s;t propo&s;ed to him&s;elf the compo&s;ition of his epic, this &s;ublime genius felt a full conviction of this prejudice of his age, re&s;pecting the influence of climate on the human mind. He tells us in one of his pro&s;e works, that he intends to write an epic <Q REND="inline">"out of our own an|cient

<P>The notion of this influence of the climate was indeed &s;o univer&s;al in tho&s;e days, that De&s;cartes feared that the warmth of the climate in France would too much exalt his imagination, and di&s;turb that temperate &s;tate of the mind nece&s;&s;ary for philo&s;ophical di&s;co|veries. He therefore took refuge from the &s;un, in Holland. All the fro&s;t of

the northern climates could never ren|der his burning imagination tepid; the vi&s;ionary would have dreamt on a pil|low of &s;now.</P>
<P>Such have been the imbecillities of great men; and on &s;uch foundations re&s;ted the brilliant edifice which the hand of Monte&s;quieu did not con&s;truct, but only adorned. It is to be lamented that &s;ome &s;uperior minds prefer the little vanity of temporary novelties to the infinite glory of enduring truths. Every error of this kind long links an additional fetter on the human mind, and half the wi&s;dom of man now con|&s;i&s;ts in de&s;troying the chains of his own fabrication. Age &s;ucceeds to age, and the human mind, as it calculates it's genuine acqui&s;itions, wonders at the petty amount; while, if we &s;cru|tini&s;e mo&s;t of our former attempts, we perceive with a &s;igh, that philo&s;ophy has been more curious than knowing, more active than progre&s;&s;ive, more
<PB N="303" REF="313">
&s;pecious than &s;olid; that it has gene|rally con&s;i&s;ted in becoming familiar with the incongruous opinions of others, and having no opinions of our own; and that while we run after the capricious coquetry of a meretricious fancy, Truth has often pa&s;t by, in &s;ober and unadorned beauty, un&s;olicited, unde&s;ired, but rarely un&s;een.</P>
<P>Let us view this topic in a more in|&s;tructive manner. Ari&s;totle, in his Politics, ob&s;erves, that the northern nations, and generally all Europe, are naturally courageous and robu&s;t, but are improper for mental exertion, without powers for meditation, and without indu&s;try for the arts; on the contrary, the A&s;iatics have great ta|lents for works of genius, are inclined to rea&s;oning and meditation, and &s;kil|ful in the invention and perfection of arts. The rever&s;e of all this, in the pre&s;ent age, is the truth. Ari&s;totle drew this repre&s;entation from the ex|i&s;ting
<PB N="304" REF="314">
&s;cene; but had that acute mind happened to reflect on the powers which the <HI>cu&s;toms</HI> and the <HI>government</HI> of a people have over the human mind, he had then perceived that not the fro&s;ts and &s;nows of the northern realms made men addict them&s;elves to war, but that predatory genius which mu&s;t prevail in a people, who were con|&s;tantly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by poverty and fa|mine. When a new civilization had taken place, and the &s;everities of the climate were mitigated by the benefi|cial influence of art and &s;cience; when the de&s;cendants of the&s;e men employed their armaments in commerce, as well as in war; when their iron was plun|ged into the reluctant bo&s;om of earth; when, in their cities, univer&s;ities were erected, academies in&s;tituted, and the peaceful occupations of genius che|ri&s;hed; then, while the &s;ame climate exi&s;ted, the national characters be|came changed. Heroic and poli&s;hed
<PB N="305" REF="315">
Greece and Rome are now barbarous and pu&s;illanimous; and the gravity and &s;uper&s;tition of the Spaniard, the po|litic and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating &s;pirit of the Ita|lian, the diligence and &s;upplene&s;s of the Scotchman, and the &s;u&s;piciou&s;ne&s;s and profundity of the Englifhman, are derived from their manners and go|vernments. MAN is a mere imitative CREATURE, and the wi&s;e LEGISLATOR may be a powerful CREATOR.</P>
<P>It was once enquired why Paris and Toulou&s;e produced &s;o many eminent lawyers. It was long attributed to the climate; till &s;ome rea&s;onable being di&s;covered, that the univer&s;ities of tho&s;e cities offered <HI>opportunities</HI> and <HI>en|couragements</HI> for that <HI>&s;tudy</HI> which others did not. The Germans have long been an injured literary nation. A ta&s;te for &s;cience and erudition having been diffu&s;ed among that indu&s;trious people, they were con&s;tantly a&s;per&s;ed by their lively neighbours, for invete|rate

dullne&s;s and &s;terile imaginations. The eminent &s;ucce&s;s of the French in the Belles Lettres, placed the fright|ened genius of that nation in a volun|tary &s;eclu&s;ion; of late awakened from their &s;tupor, they begin to rank high in polite letters; and although their productions have not yet attained that novelty of combination, which is the effect of long indu&s;try and multifarious compo&s;ition, yet have they already produced &s;ome &s;pirited and affecting works of imagination which can fear no rivals.</P>
<P>Men of genius, at London, or at Peter&s;burgh, in the retirement of their cabinet, if employed on the &s;ame to|pic, and equal in their acqui&s;itions, will think and write alike. The man|ners of a people occa&s;ion &s;ome varia|tions in national ta&s;tes; there is an ar|bitrary and an ideal beautiful; or, in other words, a local and an univer&s;al &s;en&s;ation. The pre&s;ent &s;y&s;temati&s;ers
<PB N="307" REF="317">
not having &s;ufficiently inve&s;tigated the cau&s;es of arbitrary or local &s;en&s;ations, in perceiving them, they at once re|ferred them to the influence of CLI|MATE, and not to the influence of GOVERNMENT.</P>
<P>From this and the two preceding e&s;&s;ays, we may, perhaps, conclude, that it is with a people, as with an in|dividual, and with an individual, as with a people. The human mind is indeed influenced not by climate, but by government; not by &s;oils, but by cu&s;toms; not by heat and cold, but by &s;ervitude and freedom. A happy edu|cation, an elegant lei&s;ure, and a pa&s;|&s;ion for glory, mu&s;t form a great man; as an excellent government, an or|derly liberty, and a popular felicity, mu&s;t form a great people. But for the&s;e purpo&s;es, numerous conjunctures mu&s;t &s;ucceed each other, which, in the po&s;ition of human affairs, can be but rare; and to the pre&s;ent moment
<PB N="308" REF="318">
no &s;y&s;tem of education for the indivi|dual, or &s;y&s;tem of government for the people, has been di&s;covered, which can &s;atisfy the philo&s;ophical mind; a great people, like a great man, mu&s;t therefore become a &s;ingularity; yet, as the characteri&s;tic of man is imitation, when one excels, there exi&s;ts a con|tagion of excellence. Nouri&s;hed by per&s;evering indu&s;try, a diffu&s;ion of emulation is propagated from indivi|dual to individual, and from nation to nation. Whenever, through moral cau&s;es, this emulation cannot exi&s;t, indu&s;try mu&s;t be extinct, and excel|lence unacquired.</P>
<P>INDUSTRY is the vital principle of excellence; but we mu&s;t not, there|fore, &s;uppo&s;e, that the advice of a preceptor, or the mandate of a &s;ove|reign, can produce an in&s;tantaneous effect; there is a regular progre&s;&s;ion in human affairs; and no power, le&s;s than omnipotence, could have pro|duced
<PB N="309" REF="319">
that &s;ingular operation of com|manding light, and there was light. Miracles have departed from this phi|lo&s;ophic age; but INDUSTRY is left to us, which may be &s;aid, to perform miracles.</P>

<P>This opinion &s;erves for the apology of the idle, and the con&s;olation of the di&s;appointed; but it is to be lamented that it extingui&s;hes the ardour of the ingenious. Had not genius felt it&s;elf &s;uperior to this malicious <HI>dictum,</HI> the world had wanted nearly all it's va|lued compo&s;itions. The popular no|tion of literary novelty is an idea more fanciful than exact. Of the&s;e unre|flecting cen&s;urers, many are yet to learn that their admired originals are not &s;uch as they mi&s;take them to be, either in the parts or the de&s;ign of their works.

<P>Batteux employs a judicious figure, when he compares genius to the earth, which produces nothing, unle&s;s it has fir&s;t received the &s;eeds.

&s;ub&s;tances, but their qualities are various. Novelty, in it's rigid accep|tation, will not be found in any judi|cious production. I am not, therefore, &s;urpri&s;ed, at a literary incident which happened to a friend. To relieve the tedium of a temporary retirement, he took with him &s;even epic poems; he amu&s;ed his &s;olitude by comparing them with each other; and the re&s;ult was, that he found how much each had been indebted to the others. The &s;ame incidents had been tran&s;planted, and the &s;ame characters had a&s;&s;umed a different name; but every poet had his peculiar colouring and di&s;po&s;ition, and had created while he imitated.</P>
<P>Voltaire, as a critic of ta&s;te, is of the greate&s;t authority. He looked on every thing as imitation. He ob&s;erves that the mo&s;t original writers bor|rowed one from another, and &s;ays that the in&s;truction we gather from books, is like fire; we fetch it from our neigh|bours,

kindle it at home, and com|municate it to others, till it becomes the property of all. He has a curious pa&s;&s;age, in which he traces &s;ome of the fine&s;t compo&s;itions to the fountain head; and the reader &s;miles when he perceives that they have travelled in regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion through China, In|dia, Arabia, and Greece, to France and to England.</P>
<P>To the ob&s;curity of time are the an|cients indebted for that originality in which they are imagined to excel. We know how frequently they accu&s;e each other; and to have borrowed co|piou&s;ly from preceding writers, was not con&s;idered criminal by &s;uch illu&s;|trious authors as Plato and Cicero. It has been ob&s;erved of the Eneid of Virgil, that not only little invention is di&s;played in the Incidents, for it unites the plan of the Iliad and the Ody&s;&s;ey, but even as to many of the particular lines, and certainly is very deficient in

<P>Our own early writers have not more originality than modern genius may a&s;pire to reach, To imitate and to rival the Italians and the French formed their devotion. Chaucer, Gower, and Gawin Douglas, were all &s;pirited imitators, and frequently only ma&s;terly tran&s;lators. Spen&s;er, the fa|ther of &s;o many poets, is him&s;elf the child of the Au&s;onian Mu&s;e; in bor|rowing the fancy of the Italian poe|try, he unhappily adopted it's form. Shake&s;peare has liberally honoured
<PB N="316" REF="326">
many writers by un&s;paring imitations; he has availed him&s;elf of their &s;enti|ments, their &s;tyle, and their incidents. His Oberon was taken from a French Romance, and his Fairies are no more his own original invention, than the Sylphs are of Pope. Milton is ince&s;|&s;antly borrowing from the poetry of his day. In the beautiful Ma&s;k of Comus he pre&s;erved all the circum|&s;tances of the work he imitated. The Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t is believed to have been conceived from a my&s;tery, and many of it's mo&s;t &s;triking pa&s;&s;ages are taken from other poets. Ta&s;&s;o opened for him the Tartarean Gulph; the &s;ub|lime de&s;cription of the bridge may be found in Sadi, who borrowed it from the Turki&s;h theology; the paradi&s;e of fools is a wild flower, tran&s;planted from the wilderne&s;s of Ario&s;to. Jon|&s;on was the &s;ervile &s;lave of his ancient ma&s;ters; and the rich poetry of Gray is a wonderful ti&s;&s;ue, woven on the

frames, and compo&s;ed with the gold threads of others. To Cervantes we owe Butler; and the united abilities of three great wits, in their Martinus Scriblerus, could find no other mode of conveying their powers, but by imi|tating at once, Don Quixote and Mon|&s;ieur Oufle. Pope, like Boileau, had all the ancients and moderns in his pay; the contributions he levied were not the pillages of a bandit, but the taxes of a monarch. Swift is much indebted for the plans of his two very original performances. The Travels of Gulliver, to the Voyages of Cyrano de Bergerac, to the Sun and Moon; a writer, who, without the acutene&s;s of Swift, has wilder fla&s;hes of fancy. Dr. Warton has ob&s;erved many of his &s;trokes in Bi&s;hop Godwin's Man in the Moon, who, in his turn, mu&s;t have borrowed his work from Cyrano. The Tale of a Tub is an imitation of the once popular allegory of the three

invi&s;ible rings which a father bequeath|ed his children, and which were the Jewi&s;h, Chri&s;tian, and Mahommedan religions; as this tale is al&s;o of the Hi&s;tory of Fontenelle's Mero and Enegue.

Dr. Feriar's E&s;&s;ay on the Imitations of Sterne might be con&s;iderably augment|ed; the Engli&s;hman may be tracked in many ob&s;cure paths; in &s;uch neglected volumes, as Le Moyen de Parvenir, and the Ana; be&s;ides Burton and Mar|tinus Scriblerus.

Petrarch, who is not the in|ventor of that tender poetry of which he is the model, and Boccaccio, called the father of Italian novels, have alike profited by a &s;tudious peru&s;al of wri|ters, who are now only read by tho&s;e who have more curio&s;ity than ta&s;te. Boiardo has imitated Pulci, and Ari|o&s;to, Boiardo. The madne&s;s of Orlan|do Furio&s;o, though it wears, by it's extravagance, a very original air, is only imitated from Sir Launcelot in the old Romance of Mort Arthur, with which the late Mr. Warton ob|&s;erves,
<PB N="320" REF="330">
it agrees in every leading cir|cum&s;tance. Ta&s;&s;o has imitated the Iliad, and enriched his poem with epi&s;odes from the Eneid. It is curious to ob&s;erve, that even Dante, wild and original as he appears, when he meets Virgil in the Inferno, warmly expre&s;&s;es his gratitude for the many fine pa&s;&s;ages for which he was indebted to his works, and on which he &s;ays he had <Q REND="inline">"long meditated."</Q> Moliere and La Fontaine are con&s;idered to po&s;&s;e&s;s as much originality as any of the French writers; yet the learned Menage calls Moliere <Q REND="inline">"un grand et habile pico|reur,"</Q> and Boileau tells us, that La Fontaine borrowed his &s;tyle and mat|ter from Marot and Rabelais, and took his &s;ubjects from Boccaccio, Poggius, and Ario&s;to. Nor was the eccentric Rabelais the inventor of mo&s;t of his burle&s;que narratives, and he is a very clo&s;e imitator of Folengo, the inventor of the macaronic poetry, and not a

If this were true, literary novelty might be, in the pre&s;ent refinement of the Belles Lettres, a hopele&s;s project. We mu&s;t, therefore, controvert this hypothe&s;is, or burn our pens.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Il Di&s;cor&s;o &s;opra le vicende della Litteratura of Denina, is a curious &s;ubject for literary inve&s;tigators; but I think that the book &s;upports the author, rather than the author the book.

<P>What is a new thought? The que&s;|tion has been re&s;olved by Boileau. It is not, &s;ays he, what the ignorant ima|gine;
<PB N="323" REF="333">
that is, a thought which no one ever conceived, or could have po&s;&s;ibly conceived. On the contrary, it is a thought that might have occurred to any one, but that &s;omebody has fir&s;t expre&s;&s;ed. It is what every one <HI>thinks,</HI> but is &s;aid in a lively, fine, and new <HI>manner.</HI> Pope, no doubt, borrowed his definition of wit, or genius, from this remark. It is, as he &s;ays,
<Q><L>"What oft was <HI>thought,</HI> but ne'er &s;o well <HI>expre&s;&s;ed.</HI>"</L></Q>
It is, perhaps, with writing as with &s;hooting; the art con&s;i&s;ts in the <HI>aim</HI> of the &s;port&s;man, but the objects are al|ways the &s;ame. Good &s;en&s;e has been &s;o in all ages, &s;ays Pope el&s;ewhere, who, perhaps, had more good &s;en&s;e than any poet. If we analy&s;e the mo&s;t &s;triking pa&s;&s;ages of our mo&s;t original writers, we &s;hall find that the naked idea had nothing uncommon. The fine&s;t thoughts derive their beauty from the glow and colouring of imagina|tion. I have &s;een a MS. by a friend
<PB N="324" REF="334">
of great ta&s;te, where, in examining and comparing the natural &s;entiments of two dialogues of vulgar court&s;hip, in the Exmoor dialect, with congenial and &s;imilar ideas in poetical language, he has di&s;covered that the ground|work of the human mind is always the &s;ame; and that all men think alike, but expre&s;s them&s;elves very differently. This e&s;&s;ay, probably, only intended as a literary amu&s;ement, may, however, be made to elucidate a philo&s;ophical truth.</P>
<P>Hence the mo&s;t forcible pa&s;&s;ages of Shake&s;peare, are only delightful or energetic expre&s;&s;ions of our own feel|ings. Great writers mu&s;t, therefore, bear an affinity with each other; and will eagerly adopt the images, the &s;en|timents, and the very expre&s;&s;ions of a kindred genius. We may account, on this principle, for tho&s;e &s;imilar pa&s;|&s;ages which we meet with in different works, although we are certain that
<PB N="325" REF="335">
no connection exi&s;ted between the writers. Hence &s;ometimes an Eng|li&s;hman finds in Corneille, an expre&s;|&s;ion which he exclaims is worthy of Shake&s;peare; and a Frenchman di&s;co|vers in Shake&s;peare, a &s;entiment which he knows to be equal to the eloquence of Corneille.</P>
<P>It would, therefore, appear, that there is a MANNER IN EXPRESSION, which may impart novelty to literary compo&s;ition; and I add al&s;o, that there is another MANNER OF CHARACTER, which every writer of genius exhibits.</P>
<P>The Italians de&s;cribe a certain &s;en|&s;ation by their <HI>un non &s;&ograve; che;</HI> the French by their <HI>je ne &s;&ccedil;ai quoi;</HI> and we fre|quently &s;ay <Q REND="inline">"<HI>a certain &s;omething.</HI>"</Q> The foreign writers have compo&s;ed a great deal concerning this quality; and per|haps they have ob&s;cured, what is not ob&s;cure in it&s;elf; for what is this oc|cult &s;en&s;ation but MANNER? It accom|panies every intere&s;ting object; it is
<PB N="326" REF="336">
the inexpre&s;&s;ible charm which creates &s;ympathy, or the unknown &s;omething which produces antipathy. Do we not ob&s;erve the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential truths, on the mo&s;t intere&s;ting topics, enfeebled, and even rendered repul&s;ive? And do we not &s;ometimes admire the mo&s;t tri|vial objects, when they are touched with all the felicity of manner? It ari&s;es from the ab&s;ence or the u&s;e of this prominent quality, which be&s;tows novelty on the mo&s;t familiar, and de|light on the mo&s;t arid topics. The French and Italians have a &s;pecies of writing almo&s;t peculiar to them&s;elves. It is called by the former, <HI>Rajeuni&s;&s;e|ment,</HI> and by the latter, <HI>Refaccimento.</HI> This is nothing but a rejuvene&s;cence of their ancient authors, &s;uch as are the ver&s;ions by Dryden and Pope, of &s;ome of Chaucer's Tales. Every one is not equally &s;ucce&s;sful in this em|ployment; and writers who po&s;&s;e&s;s a happine&s;s of manner, have di&s;played
<PB N="327" REF="337">
in the&s;e works it's full force; they have given, by ma&s;ter-touches, all the plea|&s;ure the originals once gave. In the hands of inferior writers, the &s;ame thoughts have been as vigilantly pre|&s;erved, but not as attractively. Seve|ral works of importance might be no|ticed, which could never be peru&s;ed in the manner of their original authors; but &s;ince they have been re-written by men of genius, every one peru&s;es them. <HI>Manner</HI> is the fir&s;t acquirement of ge|nius; it renders a &s;onnet more precious than a long poem, and has made &s;ome authors more celebrated for ten pages, than others who in vain have written ten volumes. Ob&s;erve in two of the mo&s;t popular French writers, a great contra&s;t of manner; Voltaire is a wit, and takes us by &s;urpri&s;e; Rou&s;&s;eau is an orator, and in&s;inuates his &s;oul into our own; one points his poli&s;hed epi|grams, and the other &s;teals on us by his pathetic &s;entiments; our mind is
<PB N="328" REF="338">
the aim of Voltaire, but we yield our heart to Rou&s;&s;eau. It is this manner which enchants in Addi&s;on, plea&s;es in Melmoth, and &s;ooths in Hawke&s;worth; which &s;parkles in the brilliant periods of Shafte&s;bury, ri&s;es into maje&s;ty in the grand tones of Bolingbroke, and awes in the &s;olemn cadencies of John&s;on.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This <HI>manner,</HI> in every great writer, has not e&s;|caped ob&s;ervation. The quotations may gratify lite|rary curio&s;ity. The elegant author of Fitzo&s;borne's Letters, has a little E&s;&s;ay on Grace, in which, after confe&s;&s;ing the difficulty of expre&s;&s;ing an idea, when language does not &s;upply us with proper words, he clo&s;es by &s;aying, that <Q REND="inline">"Sir William Temple may be con&s;idered as the fir&s;t pro&s;e author who introduced a graceful <HI>manner</HI> into our language."</Q></P>
<P>Addi&s;on, in the 160 Spectator, &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"I believe we may ob&s;erve, that very few writers make an ex|traordinary figure in the world, who have not <HI>&s;ome|thing</HI> in their way of <HI>thinking</HI> or <HI>expre&s;&s;ing</HI> them&s;elves, that is peculiar to them, and <HI>entirely their own.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Rou&s;&s;eau the poet, in his Epi&s;tle to Marot, ob&s;erves of great writers,
<Q><L>"Chacun d'eux a SA BEAUTE PRECISE,</L>

It is &s;ingular, that De Foe, in his E&s;&s;ay on Projects, notices a <HI>manner in writing.</HI> Perhaps he borrowed the notion from the French critics; for it would be difficult to conceive what idea he and the writers of the la&s;t century formed of it, &s;ince no one then ap|pears to have had a peculiar characteri&s;tic, or em|ployed any of tho&s;e artifices of compo&s;ition which con&s;titute a <HI>manner.</HI></P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="339">
Another &s;ource of literary novelty may be derived from IMITATION. A &s;ervile imitation is inimical to the pro|gre&s;s of art, but nothing is more ne|ce&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the refinement of art, than a frequent recurrence to it's models. To literary echoes, we may apply the &s;en&s;ible ob&s;ervation of Philip of Macedon, made to one who prided him&s;elf with imitating the notes of the nightingale; <Q REND="inline">"I prefer the nightin|gale her&s;elf."</Q> We mu&s;t fir&s;t learn to follow our predece&s;&s;ors, that we may reach them, and if we have the adroit|ne&s;s, we may then out&s;trip them; a vulgar mind can only copy, a &s;uperior mind in copying, always becomes ori|ginal. Among literary fa&s;hions, there once prevailed the cu&s;tom of imitating Cicero, it was carried to a laughable extravagance, and the corre&s;pondence of men of letters was often long inter|rupted, becau&s;e &s;ome would require three or four months to write a letter
<PB N="330" REF="340">
of three or four pages.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The&s;e &s;cholars were denominated <HI>Ciceronians,</HI> and as we have &s;till remaining &s;ome of this cla&s;s of pedants, I think the reader will not be di&s;plea&s;ed to have their character exhibited, it is &s;aid with nearly as much truth, as ridicule.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It was laughable to ob&s;erve tho&s;e pale and me|lancholy vi&s;ages, deprive them&s;elves of every plea|&s;ure, fly from the &s;ociety of the living, as if they were them&s;elves already dead, bury them&s;elves in the bier of their &s;tudy, and refrain from every kind of read|ing, except the works of Cicero, with as religious a care as Pythagoras ab&s;tained from the u&s;e of fle&s;h. Their libraries were only diver&s;ified by the different editions of the works of Cicero. Their hi&s;tories were only tho&s;e of his life; and their epics only frigid nar|ratives of his con&s;ul&s;hip; the paintings and drawings in their galleries, were only his portraits and actions. They had his head engraven on their &s;eals, as well as on their hearts. By day and by night Cicero was the only object of their enquiries and conver&s;ations. They preferred the honour of collecting certain words, and arranging a round and nicely-cadenced period, to the performance of the mo&s;t generous action. When at length, their painful vigils had attenuated their bodies with illne&s;s, they died contented, &s;ince they had augmented the number of the martyrs of Cicero, and appeared in their la&s;t agony, to be le&s;s plea&s;ed with the hope of the a&s;pect of God, than of the eternal pre&s;ence of this demon of eloquence."</Q></P>
<P>Such is the portrait Colletet has drawn of the&s;e fal&s;e imitators of Cicero!</P></NOTE> Servile imi|tation is cen&s;ured by the very expre&s;|&s;ion; that to which I now allude, is of a very different kind, and I proceed to de&s;cribe it.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="341">
This imitation is peculiar to an age of ta&s;te. It is an enthu&s;ia&s;m caught from the ince&s;&s;ant &s;tudy of the ma&s;ters in compo&s;ition; a &s;en&s;ibility and ver|&s;atility of ta&s;te, which receives the <HI>manners</HI> of every writer, and which re|produces their intermingled graces, in it's own compo&s;itions. A writer who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es this magical power, combines the varieties of his predece&s;&s;ors, and without being one of them, is all of them. He rarely finds a reader wor|thy of him&s;elf, for to reli&s;h &s;uch an au|thor, requires a delicacy and percep|tion equal to his own, and it is le&s;s difficult to ta&s;te the mere manneri&s;t, who has only one character, than the writer who combines &s;everal. A wri|ter of this de&s;cription is indefatigable in the arrangement of his compo&s;ition. A cultured imagination heightens his natural feelings, and in every part he exhibits the lighter graces and glow|ing
<PB N="332" REF="342">
&s;trokes of a brilliant art. He be|&s;tows a fre&s;hne&s;s and bloom on what|ever has been frequently touched. No thought appears feeble or vulgar, be|cau&s;e it is inve&s;ted with an elegant dre&s;s, and an ea&s;y air. The effects of &s;uch a compo&s;ition are not immedi|ately perceived, for much of the art of refinement con&s;i&s;ts in concealing, and not in obtruding. It is a &s;ilent beauty that &s;teals on in&s;en&s;ibly; it is Venus gradually ri&s;ing from the &s;ea, wave falls upon wave, beauty &s;ucceeds to beauty, till the whole enchantment of the figure is revealed.</P>
<P>A writer of this cla&s;s catches in&s;pi|ration, in his &s;olitary clo&s;et, from the labours of others. He is the &s;tudent who ha&s;tens to Rome to meditate at the feet of it's &s;tatues; he is the archi|tect who combines in the edifices with which he adorns his native city, tho&s;e
<PB N="333" REF="343">
graces, which his eye had appropri|ated in foreign countries.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Diony&s;ius of Halicarna&s;&s;us, who has written with &s;uch attic &s;en&s;ibility on literary elegancies, compares the brilliant and flowery &s;tyle, in which &s;uch writers often excel, to a living and limpid &s;tream, which ever flows, and ever with the &s;ame facility; to a change|able &s;ilk, which exhibits at every glance all the deli|cacies of &s;hades; and to a &s;plendid painting, in which the colours &s;o happily blend, and &s;weetly melt into each other.</P>
<P>The poli&s;hed ear of the ancients was &s;o accu&s;tomed to whatever was fini&s;hed, and perhaps the felicity of their language, fir&s;t gave them a ta&s;te for &s;uch exqui|&s;ite refinements, that they would con&s;ume hours in turning, and returning, a period. Of Plato it is re|corded, that he re-wrote twenty times, the &s;imple ex|pre&s;&s;ion of <Q REND="inline">"ye&s;terday I de&s;cended into the Pyraeus,"</Q> before he could &s;atisfy his delicacy. Cicero balanced the members of his periods, like notes in mu&s;ic, and re&s;erved for their clo&s;es, that harmonious pomp of words, which, by the Greeks, was &s;tyled, <Q REND="inline">"magni|ficence of &s;ound."</Q></P></NOTE></P>
<P>The able vindicator of Milton again&s;t the infamous Lauder, has this admi|rable ob&s;ervation on the pre&s;ent &s;ub|ject. <Q REND="inline">"There may be &s;uch a thing as an original work without invention; and a writer may be an imitator of others without plagiari&s;m."</Q> Among painters it is not only permitted, but even applauded, to in&s;ert a figure, or
<PB N="334" REF="344">
groupe of figures, borrowed from ano|ther arti&s;t. Raphael, no more than Pope, pa&s;&s;ed over a happy hint, or he|&s;itated to &s;eize on whatever he found to be exqui&s;ite. I know of no rea&s;on why writers are to be le&s;s favoured than painters.</P>
<P>Literary novelty appears, therefore, po&s;&s;ible to be imparted to works of ta&s;te, while there &s;hall be pre&s;erved a <HI>manner in expre&s;&s;ion,</HI> a <HI>manner in character;</HI> and a &s;kilful <HI>imitation.</HI> But two ob&s;er|vations remain to be made; that there are <HI>a fal&s;e novelty,</HI> and <HI>exhau&s;ted turns of expre&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>The popular kind of novelty is gra|tified by irregular &s;allies of the imagi|nation. To this ince&s;&s;ant demand of the ta&s;tele&s;s public, many ingenious and great writers have fallen the vic|tims. We have too frequently, in our country, pardoned eccentricity and in|correctne&s;s, for &s;ome irregular coru&s;|cations of genius. An affectation of
<PB N="335" REF="345">
novelty has often been calamitous to great minds. It has been a fertile &s;ource in &s;cience, of pernicious para|doxes, and in literature, of mon&s;trous inventions. Pere Hardouin, known for his &s;trange opinions, was u&s;ed to &s;ay, to excu&s;e them, that he did not ri&s;e at four every morning to repeat what others had &s;aid. He might have ro&s;e much later, and &s;till have been as ridiculous, for to follow the extrava|gancies of an idle imagination, has great facility. Camoens, in his Lu&s;i|ad, by a mixture of the fabulous dei|ties with the chri&s;tian theology, and Davenant, in his Gondibert, by the in|vention of a plan, repugnant to Ho|mer and nature, are eminent in&s;tances. The temporary ta&s;te of a vicious age, has been fatal to genius, and we have lo&s;t a fine poet in Cowley. To &s;ur|pri&s;e is the great aim of art; but it is to be remembered, that &s;urpri&s;e is alike excited by beauty and deformity.
<PB N="336" REF="346">
We are &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;oftened graces of a Raphael; we are &s;urpri&s;ed at the fanta&s;tical &s;trokes of a Chine&s;e painter. But which, in&s;inuate them&s;elves into our hearts, a&s;&s;ume at every in&s;pection new charms, and create an enchanting and eternal delu&s;ion?</P>
<P>That the <HI>turns of expre&s;&s;ion</HI> may be ex|hau&s;ted, is felt mo&s;t in an age of lite|rary refinement. Some of our happie&s;t modes of diction occur at length &s;o frequently, that their beauty is lo&s;t in their familiarity. At this period, it is, that the manners of a nation, are lux|urious and refined, and their defects are communicated to their &s;tyle. To invent new thoughts, is now mo&s;t rare, and to invent new expre&s;&s;ions, is now mo&s;t hazardous. Perhaps letters are verging to their decline, and can only be pre&s;erved pure in the care of tho&s;e few, who retain a pa&s;&s;ion for the &s;im|plicity of their ancient authors, and at the &s;ame time, a ta&s;te for the refine|ments
<PB N="337" REF="347">
of the moderns. Such is the u&s;ual hi&s;tory of the progre&s;s of letters; whether this de&s;cribes our pre&s;ent &s;tate, I would not decide, fearful le&s;t from the inve&s;tigation we might de|duce a conclu&s;ion not favourable to our future efforts. When the nation becomes more virtuous, we &s;hall have a more unblemi&s;hed &s;tyle.</P>
<P>Let it be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that while we deviate not too widely from the models of art, novelty may be communicated to our productions, and an originality be impre&s;&s;ed on the mo&s;t common objects. I give an in&s;tance. Eque&s;trian &s;tatues are commonly rai&s;ed on a poli&s;hed ma&s;s of marble, and &s;ur|rounded by allegorical figures. When Falconet was invited to Peter&s;burgh, to form &s;uch a &s;tatue of Peter the Great, he repre&s;ented the Emperor on a fiery cour&s;er. This idea an inferior &s;culptor might have &s;ei&s;ed. But it remained for this arti&s;t to throw over the perfor|mance
<PB N="338" REF="348">
the lu&s;tre of genius. He has placed the hor&s;e in the act of leaping from a rude, unhewed rock. Here we &s;ee expre&s;&s;ed the &s;ublime genius of Peter and the arti&s;t. Give an ordinary &s;culptor the &s;ame marble. Patient in|du&s;try will poli&s;h the limbs, trace with minute beauty the hairs of the mane, while Peter, encumbered by an alle|gorical pomp, will &s;tand unnoticed. While genius can give a <HI>new attitude,</HI> it will not want for <HI>new expre&s;&s;ion;</HI> and it is one &s;ource of that NOVELTY, which now &s;educes and captivates in the productions of art. The art of writing is the art of exciting powerful &s;en&s;ations.</P>

<HEAD>ON THE INFLUENCE OF THE FEMALE CHARACTER IN POLITICS AND RE|LIGION.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the various arguments de|duced in favour of an equality in the intellectual faculties of the &s;exes, I know not if it has been remarked, that there are certain powers, which, to be more perfect, require that &s;tation in &s;ociety occupied by the fair. I &s;hall add al&s;o, that any deficiency in other qualities, has been often compen&s;ated by the &s;eductions of their per&s;onal charms.</P>
<P>We &s;hall perceive upon inve&s;tiga|tion, that in religion and in politics, their influence has been infinitely greater, than appears in hi&s;torical re|cords; and it is one great objection to the verity of hi&s;tory, that the female
<PB N="340" REF="350">
character rarely makes any figure in &s;cenes which, by &s;ome other means, we often di&s;cover to have been planned by females with inventive felicity, and conducted with peculiar addre&s;s. We are apt to be &s;urpri&s;ed when we con|template &s;ome of the greate&s;t revolu|tions, that they derived their origin from the fair; that a government or a religion have been e&s;tabli&s;hed by a fe|male, and that while an inva&s;ion takes place, a monarch is a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, or an inqui&s;ition erected, the motive power of this va&s;t machine, is a little unper|ceived &s;pring, touched and played upon by the dexterity of a woman.</P>
<P>That the female character may ex|cel the ma&s;culine ability, in what is termed a knowledge of the world, and that there is a &s;exual di&s;tinction in this not contemptible &s;cience, is a fact, which an ob&s;erver may di&s;cover in his private circle. Bruyere is a character more extraordinary among men, than
<PB N="341" REF="351">
it would be among women; for I am per&s;uaded, that there are many female Bruyeres not accu&s;tomed to write down their ob&s;ervations, and pourtray the characters of their acquaintance. Women, of even a mediocrity of ta|lent, excel in the knowledge of their circle; and we may account for this curious circum&s;tance, on the principle of their &s;tationary &s;ituation in &s;ociety, where their opportunities for ob&s;erva|tion are more frequent, and where their perception becomes more exact, by an attention, which, though fre|quently interrupted by it's vivacity, is never entirely &s;u&s;pended. I cannot affirm that they view di&s;tantly, or pe|netrate deeply. Their eye is a plea|&s;ing micro&s;cope, which detects the mi|nute&s;t &s;troke, if placed near, though in|capable of tracing an object remotely. Many experience, and &s;ome acknow|ledge, what Rou&s;&s;eau relates of his There&s;a. This woman, whom he de|&s;cribes
<PB N="342" REF="352">
otherwi&s;e as heavy and dull, afforded him excellent advice in the mo&s;t trying occa&s;ions. <Q REND="inline">"Often"</Q> (&s;ays he) <Q REND="inline">"in Switzerland, in England, and in France, amid&s;t the cata&s;trophes I found my&s;elf, &s;he &s;aw what I did not &s;ee my&s;elf; &s;he afforded me the be&s;t coun&s;els to follow, and extricated me from dangers in which I blindly pre|cipitated my&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>If, therefore, the female di&s;plays a &s;uperior acutene&s;s, derivable from the peculiarity of her &s;ituation, tho&s;e authore&s;&s;es who appear jealous of cer|tain privileges attached to the wander|ing and active &s;ex, cannot be deemed as the able advocates of their own; becau&s;e if woman (from the natural feeblene&s;s of who&s;e organs is derived her beauty) were capable of exerting the &s;ame corporeal vigour as man, yet by becoming his rival, &s;he would not only lo&s;e that feminine &s;weetne&s;s, that amiable debility, and that retiring
<PB N="343" REF="353">
mode&s;ty which lend &s;o much eloquent per&s;ua&s;ion to her actions, but what would not be compen&s;ated by this vio|lent and unnatural change, &s;he would lo&s;e her actual po&s;ition in the &s;ocial order which imparts her pre&s;ent &s;upe|riority, by enabling her to detect the &s;ecret foibles of man. To this, her &s;ta|tionary &s;ituation, I would attribute her acknowledged &s;uperiority in conver&s;a|tion, and in epi&s;tolary compo&s;ition. To both, the female imparts a peculiar delicacy, and a charm of ea&s;e, which ma&s;ters of &s;tyle can neither imitate nor rival. The&s;e excellencies con&s;i&s;t in a volubility of happy expre&s;&s;ion, and a choice of &s;prightly ideas; on the bo|&s;om of &s;ociety the female genius is fir&s;t nurtured; the human &s;cene be|comes her &s;chool; and hence &s;he de|rives this facility of language, and this liveline&s;s and &s;election of ideas.</P>
<P>A more obvious advantage in the female character, is that &s;u&s;ceptibility
<PB N="344" REF="354">
of feeling, or facility of imagination, which, without doubt, is peculiar to the irritable delicacy of their fibres. The heart is the great province of the female; if we would attract their re|gard, we mu&s;t learn to reach the heart; all their finer qualities are &s;o many &s;en|&s;ations of the heart; and it is the heart which imbues with it's &s;oftne&s;s, their every excellence. Their favourite amu&s;ements are works of imagination and ta&s;te, not of memory and rea&s;on; their logic con&s;i&s;ts not of arguments, but of &s;entiments; and I think that &s;ome ladies of extreme refinement, can put as much fancy, and exert as rich an imagination, in the ornaments of a favourite dre&s;s, as the poet employs in his mo&s;t florid de&s;criptions.</P>
<P>In every &s;urrounding object they ex|pre&s;s their love of the beautiful; their mo&s;t u&s;eful in&s;truments have a charac|ter of delicacy; and in a word, women would effeminate even the roughne&s;s

of &s;teel, and the &s;olidity of wood; man is &s;ubjugated by the&s;e adventi|tious elegancies, and the fair, love to &s;ee that beauty admired in inanimate objects, which they know mu&s;t be much more in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I am not &s;urpri&s;ed, that in all na|tions, civili&s;ed or rude, whenever &s;u|per&s;tition prevailed, the female cha|racter has been regarded as an in&s;tru|ment of the divinity. That peculiar animation which vivifies their lively perceptions, has been con&s;idered as &s;omething &s;upernatural, and we can ea&s;ily conceive that the afflatus of pro|phecy mu&s;t ever have di&s;played a more touching illu&s;ion in the agitated and picture&s;que countenance of a woman, than in the more hard and labouring vi&s;age of a prophet; I conceive that the Grecian Pythia, the Roman Sybil, and the Pythoni&s;&s;a of the Hebrews, mu&s;t have communicated a more ce|le&s;tial in&s;piration with their copious

tre&s;&s;es luxuriating on their palpitating bo&s;om, their vivacious eyes, and their &s;nowy arms, than even a pa&s;&s;ionate I&s;aiah, or a weeping Jeremiah.</P>
<P>But to hi&s;tory, and not to declama|tion, I appeal. If we throw a philo|&s;ophical glance on it's in&s;tructive re|cords, and have the di&s;cernment to read what often is not in hi&s;tory, we &s;hall ob&s;erve that the female character has ever had a &s;ingular influence on mo&s;t of the great characters and great events of human life. One of the mo&s;t favourite portions of the hi&s;toric art, with hi&s;torians, is an elaborate deli|neation of the characters of monarchs. We &s;hould comprehend the&s;e much better if we were acquainted with tho&s;e of the Queens. Many important re&s;olutions of &s;tate councils have been fir&s;t made in the royal bed. It is an ob&s;ervation of the judicious Du Fre&s;|noy, that a Queen has an influence on the King her hu&s;band, and the King

her &s;on. And would it be difficult to &s;hew, that if the whole affairs of go|vernment depend on a Mini&s;ter, he would be impregnable again&s;t the at|tacks of a mi&s;tre&s;s? A per&s;on mu&s;t be very ignorant of &s;ecret hi&s;tory, who&s;e memory cannot at this moment place, in ridiculous and humiliating attitudes, &s;ome of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious &s;tate&s;men.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I &s;hall notice two very eminent &s;tate&s;men. Car|dinal Richelieu, to gain the affections of the Dutche&s;s de Chevreu&s;e at their private interviews, vi&s;ited her in the mo&s;t finical dre&s;s. Rejecting his &s;carlet robes and &s;acred pantoufles, his eminence wore a fa&s;hion|able coat, an enormous plume, a long rapier, and tight pumps. The Dutche&s;s hated and ridiculed the Cardinal, the Mini&s;ter, and the Coxcomb; but at that moment through him &s;he conducted innumerable intrigues within and without the kingdom. Read Plutarch's Life of Cicero, and you may ob&s;erve that his wife Terentia was not le&s;s concerned than the orator and &s;tate&s;man, in the mo&s;t &s;triking events of his public life. When Cicero was perplexed to know in what manner he &s;hould treat the con&s;pirators of Catiline, Terentia incen&s;ed him again&s;t them, and invented an ingenious prodigy to fix the vacillation of his agitated mind, and cau&s;e him to act with an energy he otherwi&s;e had wanted. The origin of the enmity between Cicero and Clodius was owing to the jealou&s;y of Terentia, who knew that his &s;i&s;ter Clodia was de&s;i|rous of marrying Cicero. She therefore in&s;tigated him to attack Clodio. By the confe&s;&s;ion of Cicero him&s;elf, it appears that Terentia was ever more ready to in|terfere in his public tran&s;actions, than to communi|cate her dome&s;tic affairs to him. It is not in a note we can adduce &s;imilar in&s;tances; but almo&s;t every Richelieu will be found to have had his Chevreu&s;e, and every Cicero his Terentia.</NOTE>

<P>Saint Evremond and Che&s;terfield, who, to the practical knowledge of life, united the wider theories of me|ditation, have expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves very forcibly on female influence at court. A French author has di&s;co|vered, that under the regency of Anne of Au&s;tria, every thing was conducted by women, and he calls this, a &s;ingu|lar epocha. The &s;ame happened un|der our own Anne.

by women? I confe&s;s that the female character has as &s;eldom been heard on the public &s;cene, as the prompter of a theatre; or as rarely been vi&s;ible as the &s;cene-&s;hifters. But mi&s;erable were that philo&s;ophy which confounds invi&s;ibility with non-exi&s;|tence; the female character, like &s;ome other objects, derives all it's influence from concealment; in politics, woman is terrible, not in the ra&s;h imbecillity of the &s;torm, but in the &s;udden explo|&s;ion of the mine.</P>
<P>Ancient and contemporary hi&s;tory will ever abound with multifarious in|&s;tances of this kind; and I &s;hall ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that even in the &s;evere re|publics of Greece and Rome, the fe|male character had the &s;ame influence; the celebrated confe&s;&s;ion of Themi&s;to|cles remarkably confirms this ob&s;erva|tion. That little boy (&s;aid he, point|ing to his &s;on) is the arbiter of Greece; for he governs his mother, his mother

Such has been the influence of the female character in politics; nor has it been le&s;s apparent in religion.</P>
<P>The ladies have been more clo&s;ely connected with religion than perhaps they are aware of. A new religion is congenial to their di&s;po&s;itions, and not merely for it's novelty. There is a luxuriancy of fancy, and a progre&s;s to ideal perfection, which every new re|ligion di&s;plays; it is honourable to their finer &s;en&s;ibilities, that they are ever the fir&s;t to incline to what appears &s;o theoretically beautiful. It is not quite &s;o honourable to tho&s;e, who pre|tending to &s;uperior &s;anctity, and even to in&s;piration, have for the promotion of the &s;y&s;tem they wifhed to e&s;tabli&s;h, artfully adopted the ideas mo&s;t dan|gerous to the imaginations of women, and taught the love of God, according to the art of Ovid.</P>
<P>That the earlie&s;t propagators of new dogmas have had recour&s;e to the&s;e in|vi&s;ible,

<P>It is a curious ob&s;ervation made by &s;ome, who pretend to &s;ingular pene|tration in the &s;cience of human nature, that the chri&s;tian religion was greatly indebted to the patronage and the &s;en|&s;ations of the &s;ex. Voltaire, who is not &s;o &s;uperficial as his adver&s;aries would make us believe, &s;ays, that half of Europe owes it's chri&s;tianity to wo|men, and Gibbons, who certainly had va&s;t erudition, in his account of the mona&s;tic life, after having mentioned the &s;everal inducements for entering into this unnatural &s;tate, with more truth than politene&s;s, adds, <Q REND="inline">"that the&s;e religious motives acted more for|cibly on the infirm minds of females."</Q>
<PB N="357" REF="367">
It is certain, that from the influence of the female character, we derive nearly all the prominent events of re|ligious hi&s;tory. The fir&s;t dominions of the Pope, and con&s;equently the origin of the papal power, are the gifts of a lady. Gregory VII. had &s;o lively an intere&s;t in the heart of the Counte&s;s Mathilda, that &s;he made a donation of all her &s;tates to the holy &s;ee. In&s;ti|gated by the eloquence of St. Jerome, the illu&s;trious Paula for&s;ook Rome, re|tired to the &s;acred village of Bethlem, and founded &s;everal mona&s;teries. To Torquemada, who had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mind of I&s;abella of Spain (the be&s;t Spani&s;h e&s;tate he could have &s;ei&s;ed on) the world is indebted for the cruel inqui&s;ition. And in a word, chri&s;ti|anity in England is derived from a French prince&s;s, who having married Ethelbert, fir&s;t &s;tipulated for the free exerci&s;e of her religion, and &s;oon had &s;uch influence on her hu&s;band, as to

<P>It is thus that the female character has ever had an invi&s;ible influence on two of the mo&s;t important branches of human events, politics and religion. A &s;uperiority of talent, in one re&s;pect, has produced this unvaried re&s;ult. This talent con&s;i&s;ts in a great know|ledge of man, a &s;u&s;ceptibility of im|pre&s;&s;ion, and a peculiarity of &s;ituation. In the dome&s;tic circle, the female is ince&s;&s;antly occupied in di&s;intangling, or combining the pa&s;&s;ions &s;he ob&s;erves or &s;he inflames. Her &s;edentary life, and her quietne&s;s of mind, are little interrupted by that variety of pur&s;uits to which the bu&s;ier &s;ex are devoted. Her circle is her empire; her com|mands, &s;ays Rou&s;&s;eau, are her care&s;&s;es, and her threats are her tears. Inca|pable, perhaps, of patient de&s;igns, her
<PB N="359" REF="369">
plans are rapidly conceived, and often fail, if they require a tedious proce&s;s of elaborate events. They are not deeply laid, but are adapted for temporary effect. The female attends to tho&s;e minute particulars, often unperceived, and generally carele&s;sly con&s;idered as unworthy of an elevated mind, but which often adroitly managed, give a new and &s;udden turn to important ob|jects; and &s;he appears to know much better than man, that little pa&s;&s;ions can produce great effects. For &s;ur|rounding objects her perceptions are vivid; but &s;he cannot, with the pre|&s;cient eye of philo&s;ophy, di&s;tinctly trace objects at a remote period. Her intellectual arithmetic can calculate as far as days and months, but extends not to years. She excels man in ob|taining a pre&s;ent purpo&s;e; her inven|tion is prompt, her boldne&s;s happy, and her execution facile; manly per|&s;everance proceeds with a cautious,
<PB N="360" REF="370">
firm, and gradual progre&s;&s;ion. Let us con&s;ider the &s;exual advantages. The female can excite by legitimate eulo|giums, and can correct by &s;evere pa|negyrics; &s;he makes man exult or blu&s;h; &s;he can allure by a &s;mile, &s;he can enchant by a touch, &s;he can &s;ub|due by her endearments. She over|turns, or produces in an hour, the la|bour of years. She has ever &s;omething re&s;erved for the la&s;t effort; &s;omething which has often degraded wi&s;dom into folly, and elevated folly into wi&s;dom, and which, while it can render activity torpid, imparts action to indolence.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>If this e&s;&s;ay &s;hould by &s;ome be con&s;idered as one of the numerous adulations of the &s;ex, this note will undeceive them. I am per&s;uaded of the influence they have had in religion and in politics, and I attri|bute it to that &s;tationary point they hold in &s;ociety; but let it be ob&s;erved, that they only obtain this fa&s;|cination in the wor&s;t &s;tages of &s;ociety; in the ages of luxury and licentiou&s;ne&s;s. As we approach &s;impli|city, they lo&s;e their degrading power; and this influ|ence over men is little to their credit, becau&s;e men at that moment have degenerated from the higher vir|tues. The very re&s;pect we pay to women is an arti|ficial &s;en&s;ation; they are objects that always claim pro|tection, but not often reverence. We tremble before a woman, and are in de&s;pair at her cen&s;ure. What rea&s;on can be alledged why the feeble are to bring down, even beneath their level, the &s;trong and nobler genius of man? We mu&s;t conclude, that when the female character has &s;o powerful an influence in hu|man affairs, man mu&s;t be greatly perverted. It was in corrupted France that &s;he became the arbitre&s;s of fortune.</P>
<P>Woman, from the place &s;he occupies in &s;ociety, de|rives her artifice, and from her defective education, her frivolity. By the one &s;he deceives, but by the other &s;he is ea&s;ily deceived. In the opinion of re|flecting men, &s;he is more injured by her frivolity, than by her art. The female character is a cruel &s;o|vereign who admits of no toleration in her empire. He who has di&s;covered the art of giving importance to trifles, and rendering important things trifling, is certain of her admiration; but he may employ the gro&s;&s;e&s;t artifices to obtain her favours; becau&s;e &s;he is taken by the &s;emblances of things. Why has the female character, in all ages, and through all the diver&s;ities of human manners, been mo&s;t &s;everely treated, by men of the fine&s;t di&s;cernment? Becau&s;e it is a kind of revenge; men of great talents mu&s;t never expect to receive their celebrity from women; for they mu&s;t fir&s;t become frivolous; that is, great men mu&s;t &s;ubmit to become women. But when we look over the catalogue of illu&s;trious men, &s;carce a &s;olitary in&s;tance exi&s;ts of this &s;oleci&s;m in nature.</P>
<P>I conclude by repeating that the female character derives all her importance from the depravity of man; but if, by a very different &s;y&s;tem of education, &s;he could employ this influence, to rai&s;e, rather than to depre&s;s, the character of man, would it not be a happy reformation?&mdash;Yes, for the <HI>&s;tate,</HI> but not for the <HI>&s;ex.</HI></P>
<P>The nation would acquire great men, but the wo|men would lo&s;e their idolaters.</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections are to be confined to the females of the higher and corrupt orders of &s;ociety; and to tho&s;e, particularly, of a voluptuous nation. In our country the female character has rarely exhibited that depravity of heart, that duplicity of manners, and that laxity of moral &s;entiment, which have di&s;graced the women of France. Becau&s;e the character of Engli&s;hmen has been ever more au&s;tere than that of Frenchmen; and it is in proportion to the degene|racy of men, that women degenerate. It is remark|able that the eminent examples of female talents and female virtues, always exi&s;t when the &s;ame virtues and the &s;ame talents are exerted by men. The mo&s;t amiable beings are, therefore, the mo&s;t flexible, and for their derelictions, man mu&s;t reproach him&s;elf, but never the female character. Have not Juvenal and Boileau, Pope and Young, Che&s;terfield and Bruyere, and others, con&s;idered them&s;elves rather as &s;atiri&s;ts than philo&s;ophers?</P></NOTE><PB N="361" REF="371">

<P>IT has been remarked that there is a frame of mind, &s;o con&s;tituted, that it becomes naturally religious; as it is certain that there are &s;ome tempera|ments which are naturally amorous.

<P><PB N="365" REF="375">
Poets are amorous, lovers are poe|tical, but &s;aints are both. Religion, love, and poetry, are &s;treams from the &s;ame fountain; they are alike charac|teri&s;ed by a certain tender melancholy, which ever accompanies the quiet in|tervals of an enthu&s;ia&s;tic fancy; while often there is a &s;tage in the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, at which rea&s;on di&s;appears, and a con|tinued or a temporary in&s;anity is pre|valent; and among lunatics the greater part will frequently be di&s;covered to be religious, poetical, or amorous.

The genius of tho&s;e pious men, &s;urvived in their modern de&s;cen|dants, and women, it is &s;carce nece&s;|&s;ary to add, are always women. Tho&s;e hand&s;ome &s;eraphs in France, who were called directors, and who had nothing gho&s;tly about them but their functions, retained the &s;ame extraor|dinary influence, and have performed miracles in the cau&s;e of religion and gallantry. The young devotees of our numerous &s;ects are not le&s;s &s;en&s;itive; and while they blend with an exce&s;s of devotion, all the intemperance of love, &s;often the groans of religious

<P>The Catholic religion is an academy of love. The effu&s;ions of a Spaniard to the Virgin, and a repentant frail one, addre&s;&s;ing her prototype Mary Magdalen, with an <Q REND="inline">"<HI>ora pro nobis,</HI>"</Q> employ language which comports as little with piety as mode&s;ty. I have even heard a pretty Arian &s;peak, with &s;ome conviction, of the divinity of Je&s;us, after having read the beautiful de&s;cription of his per&s;on in Jo&s;ephus; and which was interpolated by &s;ome monk, who well knew that even the &s;on of God would come recommended to the ladies, by the charms of his per&s;on. The illu&s;trious pious are al|ways repre&s;ented as beautiful; from the oriental ob&s;cenities of Solomon, the Jewi&s;h Ovid, to the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of Zinzendorff, and the indecencies of Whitfield.</P>

The union exi&s;ting between love and religion no where appears clearer, than by the confe&s;&s;ion &s;aid to be made by Mahomet; that the plea&s;ures of the &s;ex rendered him more fervent in prayer. In love, as well as religion, he mu&s;t have been an adequate judge; for he was a Turk, and a prophet; the fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ing a great experience in &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures, and the other in &s;piritual delights. He promi&s;ed for the reward of piety, a bevy of immor|tal beauties; every prophet, like every phy&s;ician, has recommended that &s;y&s;|tem to their patients which they found mo&s;t agreeable to their own feelings. But I cannot perceive that the opinion of Mahomet at all differed from that of a Chri&s;tian Saint, Catharine, who ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"how unhappy mu&s;t be the &s;tate of the damned, &s;ince they are no longer capable of <HI>loving.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>To pur&s;ue our &s;peculation with &s;omething like hi&s;torical regularity, we

may ob&s;erve, that David and his &s;on are not le&s;s celebrated for the number of their P&s;alms and Proverbs, than for their Concubines. It is fortunate for them, that we have no &s;ecret memoirs of tho&s;e days; we know, however, &s;ufficient; and indeed we could not expect great regularity of manners in men, who were at once poets, lovers, and &s;aints. Glancing into the early ages of chri&s;tianity, I pa&s;s over an anecdote of no le&s;s a per&s;on than the author of the Chri&s;tian Creed, who is &s;aid to have concealed him&s;elf, for a con&s;iderable time, in the embraces of a favourite devotee; but Saint Atha|na&s;ius a&s;&s;ures us, that during the whole time, he lay hid in an empty jar. Pro|ceeding to a later period we di&s;cover the amatorial &s;pirit to be &s;o congenial to religion, that public marriages were &s;olemni&s;ed between &s;ome eminent cha|racters, and a favourite &s;aint. Pope Pius V. was publicly united in matri|mony

to Saint Catharine; and the au|thor of his life a&s;&s;ures us, that this ancient lady ki&s;&s;ed him, and pre&s;ented him with a ring of her own hair. Tan|chelm of Antwerp publicly e&s;pou&s;ed an image of the Virgin Mary, and with no incon&s;iderable portion; for having placed two boxes near her, to receive the voluntary contributions of the nu|merous &s;pectators, the women were &s;o fa&s;cinated with the idea of a nuptial ceremony, that, alike animated by love and religion, they tore their neck|laces and ear-rings, to pre&s;ent them to the Virgin and her Tanchelm.</P>
<P>De&s;cending to a later period we ob|&s;erve the &s;ame cau&s;e operating the &s;ame effects. The &s;ingular in&s;titutions of chivalry, illu&s;trate the alliance be|tween the two pa&s;&s;ions. The learned Saint Palaye has ob&s;erved, that the fir&s;t le&s;&s;ons of chivalry related to the love of God and the ladies; that is, reli|gion and gallantry. <Q REND="inline">"The ladies,"</Q> he
<PB N="371" REF="383">
&s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"taught them, at the &s;ame time, their catechi&s;m and the art of love."</Q> It was in the genuine &s;pirit of chivalry, that Boccaccio returned thanks to God and the ladies, for the &s;ucce&s;s of his agreeable and licentious tales. Boc|caccio at length became &s;o voluptuous in his indulgence for love, poetry, and religion, that this unfortunate man of genius was &s;ei&s;ed by the terrors of the prie&s;ts, and appears to have clo&s;ed his days in the lunacy of catholici&s;m.</P>
<P>From the twelfth century to no re|mote period, nothing plea&s;ed in devo|tion, but what was combined with love. Romances were filled with reli|gion, as well as religion with roman|ces. They ha&s;tened to confe&s;&s;ion to find lovers, and having found lovers, probably perceived it nece&s;&s;ary to re|turn to confe&s;&s;ion. The learned Leng|let du Fre&s;noy comes here to my a&s;&s;i&s;|tance. Writing on the romances of this period, he ob&s;erves, that <Q REND="inline">"Je&s;us
<PB N="372" REF="384">
Chri&s;t and Apollo, Cupid and the Holy Gho&s;t, Venus and the Virgin, went hand in hand in the early productions of this kind."</Q> Of the&s;e works one only is printed, which is the celebrated Roman de la Ro&s;e.</P>
<P>The primers of the pious were at one period &s;o many votive offerings to love. In the reign of Henry III. of France, mo&s;t great men had the&s;e re|ligious manuals illuminated with &s;ub|jects, from the &s;acred writings, in which were introduced the portraits of their favourite minions and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. Charles V. had a mi&s;&s;al painted for his mi&s;tre&s;s, of a &s;imilar de&s;cription; it was ornamented by figures depicted by Albert Durer, and the &s;ubjects were not le&s;s extravagant than licentious. So po&s;&s;ible is it to be &s;ervent at once in love and religion, that the Queen of Navarre, in one of her novels, no|tices a Prince, who, going to his u&s;ual a&s;&s;ignation with the lady of a coun&s;el|lor,
<PB N="373" REF="385">
always &s;topped to pray in a Church which he pa&s;&s;ed; her Maje&s;ty highly applauds his devotion, as well as his pa&s;&s;ion; and advi&s;es all true lovers not to neglect the duties of religion.</P>
<P>Several curious publications might be mentioned, compo&s;ed by pious per|&s;ons. Of the&s;e modern works, none is more &s;ingular than the life of Marie &agrave; la Coque, not inelegantly written by an Archbi&s;hop of Sens. This woman was a vi&s;ionary, who, having over|heated her brain, by the peru&s;al of re|ligious works, and the rigours of peni|tential fa&s;ts, betrothed her&s;elf to Je&s;us. From her own narrative the Archbi|&s;hop compo&s;ed this pious romance, in which the whole progre&s;s of her cele&s;|tial amour is traced in the &s;tyle of a circulating-library novel. We have a copy of amatory ver&s;es, which Je&s;us wrote to his new &s;pou&s;e, and &s;cenes are de&s;cribed with great lubricity of imagination. It is certain this inge|nious
<PB N="374" REF="386">
Archbi&s;hop could not have be|lieved the reveries he wrote; but he well knew that &s;uch fictions, delivered as truths, would have a great offect with the devotees, and it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed, that the Pari&s;ian Belle was charmed to wor&s;hip a deity, &s;o much re&s;embling <HI>un homme du grand monde.</HI> Similar publications abound in French and Spani&s;h literature, and it has been ob&s;erved, by &s;ome of their ca&s;ui&s;ts, that they always found the greate&s;t &s;inners made the greate&s;t &s;aints; the rea&s;on is not difficult to di&s;cern, &s;ince &s;uch &s;anctity is in proportion to the criminal imaginations of the religioni&s;t.</P>
<P>Even the ceremonies of religion, both in ancient and in modern times, have exhibited the gro&s;&s;e&s;t indecencies. Prie&s;ts, in all ages, have been the &s;uc|ce&s;sful panders of the human heart, and have introduced in the &s;olemn wor|&s;hip of the divinity, incitements, gra|tifications, and repre&s;entations, which
<PB N="375" REF="387">
the pen of the hi&s;torian mu&s;t refu&s;e to de&s;cribe. Often has the &s;en&s;ible Ca|tholic blu&s;hed amid&s;t his devotions; and I have &s;een Chapels &s;urrounded by pictures of la&s;civious attitudes, and the ob&s;olete amours of &s;aints revived by the pencil of &s;ome Aretine. At this moment there exi&s;ts a con&s;iderable trafic of <HI>certain</HI> waxen figures, in &s;ome parts of Calabria, which a royal edict in vain attempted to aboli&s;h; and it is urged in it's favour, by the prie&s;ts of the neighbourhood, that in no part of Italy are the young devotees &s;o fervent in prayer, and &s;o ob&s;equious to the in&s;tructions of the prie&s;t.</P>
<P>In religious &s;olitude, the&s;e confu&s;ed notions of love and religion perplexed the wavering and debilitated heart of the pious Reclu&s;e. On the burning pillow of the Monk hovered phantoms of melancholy lu&s;t; his fancy was the &s;courge of the furies, and of the innu|merable vi&s;ions with which the&s;e men
<PB N="376" REF="388">
were di&s;turbed, they were ever accom|panied by the &s;educing form of a beau|tiful female, and the day was pa&s;&s;ed in contrition for the temptations of the nightly demon. Their homilies were manuals of love, and the more reli|gious they became, the more depraved were their imaginations. In the nun|nery, the love of Je&s;us was the mo&s;t abandoned of pa&s;&s;ions, and the ideal e&s;pou&s;al was indulged at the co&s;t of the feeble heart of many a &s;olitary beauty. Several manu&s;cript diaries have been pre&s;erved of the&s;e amiable fanatics, in which the embraces and &s;en&s;ations of &s;piritual love are not dif|tingui&s;hable from tho&s;e of a material nature. An eternal meditation on the &s;ame object, terminated frequently in the horrors of delirium; and when the &s;oul, by a cea&s;ele&s;s inquietude, had accu&s;tomed it&s;elf to be penetrated with the love of Je&s;us, while all other ideas faded and vani&s;hed from the mind, it
<PB N="377" REF="389">
&s;unk in the &s;tupor of imbecillity, and could alone occupy it&s;elf by this &s;oli|tary idea. Ti&s;&s;ot has given a ca&s;e of this nature; a young woman having yielded her&s;elf up to all the extrava|gance of love and religion, during &s;ix months that he attended her, &s;he could only articulate at intervals, <Q REND="inline">"my beloved lamb, come to my arms."</Q></P>
<P>We mu&s;t now turn our ob&s;ervations to a con&s;iderable portion of the reli|gious world, who, known under va|rious denominations, may be cla&s;&s;ed under the generic title of My&s;tics. The ancient Platoni&s;ts appear to have re&s;embled the modern My&s;tics; they carried the&s;e united pa&s;&s;ions to a great perfection; yet, it is clear, that the Platoni&s;ts trembled to gather the ce|le&s;tial palms of religion, on the preci|pices of love. John Norris, a cele|brated Engli&s;h Platoni&s;t, in his "The|ory and Regulation of Love," con&s;i|dering all vices and virtues, as the
<PB N="378" REF="390">
various modifications and irregularities of love, maintains this principle, that the love of God ought to be entire, and exclu&s;ive of all other loves. This &s;ingular di&s;tnction could never have entered into the imagination of any per&s;on, excepting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">hat or a lover and religioni&s;t; but, without doubt, the author had found it, among his female Platoni&s;ts, as a principle very nece&s;&s;ary to inculcate.</P>
<P>The My&s;tics were enamoured of the &s;weet union. Of the&s;e, Antoinette Bourignon is among the mo&s;t celebra|ted. She per&s;uaded &s;ome, and what is more &s;trange, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have per&s;uaded her&s;elf, that &s;he received the vi&s;itations of the divine &s;pirit. Her opinions became &s;o fa&s;hionable, that they were propagated in this country, and Le&s;ley thought proper to publi&s;h an elaborate refutation of her errors. We are told &s;he was endowed with an extraordinary gift of cha&s;tity, and
<PB N="379" REF="391">
which, &s;he informs us, had been fre|quently attempted; &s;candalous reports were on the wing, and the anticipated them. She, like other female &s;aints a&s;piring to be e&s;pou&s;ed to the Son of God, was de&s;irous the public &s;hould know, that &s;he was not incapable of attracting &s;everal young men. The fa&s;cinating ardours of the&s;e My&s;tics prevailed over the gentle mind of the virtuous Fenelon, who once rendered a man of fine genius ridiculous to all Europe by his patronage of Madame Guyon. The &s;age author of Telema|chus wandered in his retirement, &s;tu|dious of her <Q REND="inline">"&s;piritual guide,"</Q> her <Q REND="inline">"&s;hort way,"</Q> and her <Q REND="inline">"torrents."</Q> The imagination of this lady was not of the mo&s;t cha&s;te, nor of the mo&s;t beautiful kind, yet it was certainly imagination, and it's wild fervours overpowered the &s;u&s;ceptible &s;oul of Fenelon. By the alchemy of his own fine genius, he turned ob&s;cenity into
<PB N="380" REF="392">
purity, and incoherence into regula|rity. How are we otherwi&s;e to ac|count for this &s;ingular fa&s;cination?</P>
<P>The &s;ame genius characteri&s;es our female Methodi&s;ts, who ha&s;ten to their Chapel, as the fa&s;hionable to the front boxes of the Theatre. An ex|traordinary neatne&s;s of dre&s;s di&s;tin|gui&s;hes a devotee, and while &s;he &s;ings a tender p&s;alm, the warme&s;t tears, and the mo&s;t voluptuous &s;ighs, atte&s;t her &s;en&s;ibility. An intrigue too often com|mences in a pew; and I do not know why the magi&s;trates, who are empow|ered to pro&s;ecute the venders of ob|&s;cene publications, permit the hymns, the diaries, and other rapturous effu|&s;ions of our fanatics. The&s;e are the Ovidian touches of the kitchen. Where are to be found, as among &s;imilar &s;ects, an equal number of lovers? If one part of a&s;cetic chri&s;tianity threatened, if univer&s;ally adopted, to depopulate the world, the other, of my&s;tic chri&s;|tianity,
<PB N="381" REF="393">
appears re&s;olute in rectifying that political error; and perhaps no &s;ociety &s;o &s;mall as that of methodi&s;m, has produced to the State, &s;o many additional members.</P>
<P>This clo&s;e alliance between love and religion, many writers have noticed, without accounting for it; and the greater part have only ventured to ex|pre&s;s their a&s;toni&s;hment, and to doubt the fact. A great ob&s;erver of the hu|man character, enquires if the heart can conciliate &s;uch oppo&s;ite pa&s;&s;ions, and admit &s;uch incompatibilities? But we &s;ee that the pa&s;&s;ions are not oppo|&s;ite or incompatible; &s;ince libertini&s;m has been one in&s;trument which the hand of prie&s;ts has employed for the purpo&s;es of religion. It is acutely ob|&s;erved by Monte&s;quieu, that a My&s;tic is only mad, devout, and licentious. But we may al&s;o add, that the deli|rium has often only con&s;i&s;ted in the expre&s;&s;ions which the&s;e per&s;ons adopt;
<PB N="382" REF="394">
and all the extatic vi&s;ions they notice, are &s;ometimes only &s;o many metaphors, by which they conceal their liber|tini&s;m of mind. The Methodi&s;ts of the la&s;t century (for methodi&s;m is an old folly with a new name) employed all this devotional cant. The father of our immortal dramati&s;t, probably far gone in love and religion, thus ex|pre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in his will, <Q REND="inline">"I be|queath my &s;oul to be entombed in the &s;weet and <HI>amorous</HI> coffin of the <HI>&s;ide</HI> of Je&s;us Chri&s;t!"</Q> Even elegant minds, adding to the orga&s;m of poetry, that of religious extacy, employ the &s;tyle of the mo&s;t plaintive and tender lo|vers. Racine the &s;on, in his Poem on Religion, has many &s;uch touches. He engraved under his crucifix, the very expre&s;&s;ions Tibullus has addre&s;&s;ed to his mi&s;tre&s;s. The Latin poet &s;ays,
<Q><L>Te &s;pectem, &s;uprema mihi cum venerit hora,</L>
<L>Te teneam moriens, deficiente manu.</L></Q>
<PB N="383" REF="395">
Which Racine thus adopts, in addre&s;|&s;ing Je&s;us,
<Q><L>Que ta Croix dans mes mains &s;oit &agrave; ma derniere heure,</L>
<L>Et que, les yeux &s;ur toi, je t'embra&s;&s;e et je meure.</L></Q></P>
<P>In an epi&s;tle, &s;uppo&s;ed to be writ|ten by the famous Abb&eacute; Ranc&eacute;, of La Trappe, the alliance between love and religion is well marked in the follow|ing ver&s;e,
<Q><L>Je n'avois plus d'Amante, il me fallut un Dieu.</L></Q>
Our &s;ublime Milton, who, as he was a great poet, and no incon&s;iderable fanatic, mu&s;t have been, no doubt, a warm lover, appears al&s;o to have con|ceived that the rewards of a future &s;tate, can only con&s;i&s;t of amatorial plea&s;ures. This curious pa&s;&s;age is in the Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, book v. ver&s;e 612. Adam is thus conver&s;ing with the angel,
<Q><L>"To love thou blame&s;t me not, for <HI>love,</HI> thou &s;ay&s;t,</L>
<L><HI>Leads up to heaven,</HI> is both the <HI>way and guide</HI>;</L>
<L>Bear with me then, if law&s;ul what I a&s;k;</L>
<L><HI>Love not</HI> the heavenly &s;pirits; and how their love</L>

<L><HI>Irradiance,</HI> virtual or immediate <HI>touch?</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="384" REF="396">
I will not fatigue the reader with additional confirmations of what I have advanced. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that the enthu&s;ia&s;t Rou&s;&s;eau, who cer|tainly was a poet, though he wrote in pro&s;e; a lover of exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility, though he married his laundre&s;s; and pious, though he wrote again&s;t the clergy, perceived the union which has pa&s;&s;ed under our examination. In one of his notes to his delicious romance, he ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline">"That the enthu&s;ia&s;m of devotion borrows the language of loves the enthu&s;ia&s;m of love borrows the lan|guage of devotion."</Q></P>
<P>I conclude by ob&s;erving, that one of the mo&s;t dangerous corruptions, in|troduced into religion, by artful and athei&s;tical prie&s;ts, has been that of the mo&s;t libidinous pa&s;&s;ions. How much, therefore, is it to the honour of our e&s;tabli&s;hed Church, that it alone, of every branch of chri&s;tianity, does not

<HEAD>ON FRENCH AND ENGLISH POETRY, AND ON SOME FRENCH WORDS.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the peculiar felicities of an Engli&s;hman, are to be accounted &s;ome of his literary enjoyments. He peru&s;es with continued rapture, the works of Shake&s;peare and Milton. One mu&s;t be accu&s;tomed from the mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible age, to accommodate one|&s;elf to their &s;trong and ver&s;atile genius; as the Turks, habituated to their fa|vourite opium, fea&s;t deliciou&s;ly on co|pious quantities, which would inebri|ate and di&s;gu&s;t a foreigner.</P>
<P>An Engli&s;h critic dete&s;ts French po|etry, as loyally, as he does French po|litics. The plenteous ro&s;es that grow on the borders of the Seine, pa&s;&s;ed through his alembic, yield but a few drops of odour; but I conceive this to
<PB N="387" REF="399">
be no defect of the ro&s;es, but of the alembic.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide, a French critic cannot patiently endure ten pages of Shake&s;peare and Milton. The plea|&s;ure is uncertain and fugitive, while the di&s;gu&s;t is frequent and repul&s;ive. He views a chaos of genius, where light and darkne&s;s are in continual op|po&s;ition; elaborate deformities and mi&s;placed beauties; grandeur neigh|bouring to meanne&s;s.</P>
<P>Such are the deci&s;ions of national critics; but it is po&s;&s;ible to cen&s;ure both parties, by applauding the com|po&s;itions of both.</P>
<P>It is evident that the genius of Eng|li&s;h and French poetry is widely dif|ferent. Our theatre and our poems afford the proofs. The Cato of Addi|&s;on, which by it's regularity of plot, and correctne&s;s of compo&s;ition, has ever been a great favourite in France, is at home rarely acted, and is much
<PB N="388" REF="400">
more approved than applauded. The French &s;ay that we had no perfect tra|gedy till Cato appeared. Among a few kindred compo&s;itions, the Phaedra of Smith, one of the mo&s;t elegant and cla&s;&s;ical of our dramatic pieces, was very ill received on the &s;tage. The Temple of Fame, of Pope, one of his mo&s;t elaborate, was his lea&s;t popular poem; it never attracted notice, is rarely quoted, and the opinion of Steele at fir&s;t augured it's ill &s;ucce&s;s. Yet it is this poem which M. Yart in his &s;elections of Engli&s;h poetry, gave as one of it's mo&s;t precious com|po&s;itions, and this opinion has been confirmed by the French critics. Of the French poets, Corneille is the mo&s;t attacked in his country, and the mo&s;t admired in our own. He bears &s;ome affinity to the irregular force of Shake&s;peare; he has many of his de|fects, and &s;ometimes his beauties. His characters are heroic; and he &s;acri|fices
<PB N="389" REF="401">
little to the &s;ighing and amorous theatre of the French. The real emo|tions of love, Corneille appears never to have felt in poetry; all his females are heroines and politicians. What mu&s;t we think of Emilia, in Cinna, who will not be&s;tow her hand, unle&s;s &s;he receives for the nuptial gift, the head of Augu&s;tus? Another heroine only unites her&s;elf to Sertorius, for the plea|&s;ure of puni&s;hing Pompey. The cele|brated &s;cenes between Chimene and Rodrigue di&s;cover little of the delicacy of the amatorial pa&s;&s;ion. But he is a hero, and Engli&s;hmen feel a congeni|ality of di&s;po&s;ition. The love &s;cenes in which Corneille has failed, would not have equally gratified us, had they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the continued elegance, the &s;weet volubility, and pervading &s;oftne&s;s of Racine. His defects, therefore, are not &s;o &s;en&s;ibly felt in this country as in his own, and his beauties are much more. I found this critici&s;m upon
<PB N="390" REF="402">
facts, and I think that Pope, in one line, has conveyed our national &s;enti|ment re&s;pecting the&s;e two great rivals, and ma&s;ters of the French drama;
<Q><L>"<HI>Exact</HI> Racine, and Corneille's <HI>noble fire.</HI>"</L></Q></P>
<P>Our national genius has ever been more vigorous than graceful, and more &s;olid than refined. We are not le&s;s partial to the bizarre than the beauti|ful, and we are plea&s;ed with a Ho|garth, at lea&s;t as often, as with a Ra|phael. The French preceded us in polite literature and polite critici&s;m, and I much fear that we have not yet approached the eloquence of their fine&s;t compo&s;itions. We exult in the &s;trength of our oaks, and contemp|tuou&s;ly regard the delicacy of their vines; but, perhaps, we may yet be plea&s;ed to unite them on the &s;ame &s;oil.</P>
<P>One circum&s;tance in this variance of ta&s;te, long appeared to me my&s;terious. Cla&s;&s;ical literature is &s;tudiou&s;ly culti|vated in England; no nation is &s;o
<PB N="391" REF="403">
much attached to the Grecians and the Latins, as Engli&s;hmen; and it would therefore &s;eem, that that which mo&s;t approaches their manner, would be mo&s;t adapted to gratify the national ta&s;te. But how is it that the rever&s;e is the fact? We have few poets, ex|cepting Pope, who are profe&s;&s;ed imi|tators of the ancients, while in France, their eminent poets have enriched them&s;elves with their &s;poils.</P>
<P>This national &s;ingularity, of &s;tudents devoting them&s;elves to the cla&s;&s;ical Mu&s;es, while the public at large are not delighted by a poet, who forms him&s;elf on the models of antiquity, may, perhaps, be accounted for in the following manner. The character of our earlie&s;t poetry is Gothic; our poetical infancy was nouri&s;hed with Italian milk, and the venerable Chau|cer educated his Mu&s;e in the &s;chools of Italian fancy. Spencer, Shake&s;|peare, and Milton, completed the na|tion's
<PB N="392" REF="404">
poetical ta&s;te. In the reign of Charles II. a new &s;chool was com|menced by Dryden, and &s;ince perfected by Pope, with which we are now fa|miliari&s;ed; but I conceive that there remains a certain licentiou&s;ne&s;s and boldne&s;s in the national poetical ta&s;te, which is inimical to regularity and correctne&s;s.</P>
<P>An independent &s;pirit characteri&s;ed the poets of the Gothic &s;chool; but like all independence, their manners have a mixture of the grand and the mean, the heroic and the puerile. Their daring and uncontrouled &s;pirit often attained to a loftine&s;s unknown to their cla&s;&s;ical rivals, but their opu|lence is
<Q><L>"Barbaric pearl and gold."</L> 
<BIBL>Pope.</BIBL></Q>
Their imagination wandered in a new creation; it was more ab&s;tracted, more wild, more lu&s;trous. But it was fre|quently,
<PB N="393" REF="405">
as one of them&s;elves ex|pre&s;&s;es it,
<Q><L>"Dark with exce&s;&s;ive light."</L>
<BIBL>Milton.</BIBL></Q>
It cannot be &s;aid that the&s;e votari&s;ts of the imagination had the mode&s;t dig|nity, the clear conduct, and the &s;ub|dued imagination of Virgil; but rather the originality, the &s;pirit, and the ve|hemence of Homer. One need only have ta&s;te to receive the tranqull plea|&s;ures of a cla&s;&s;ical poet, but the Go|thic writers are unintelligible, if we cannot a&s;&s;imilate our minds with their peculiar di&s;po&s;itions.</P>
<P>It is not, therefore, &s;urpri&s;ing, that Ario&s;to and Ta&s;&s;o, Spen&s;er and Milton, and Shake&s;peare, who felicitou&s;ly uni|ted their varied characters, to his own powerful conceptions of the human character, &s;hould have excited the wit, the rea&s;oning, and the ridicule, of the critics of the oppo&s;ite &s;chool. It is like cen&s;uring the manners of a
<PB N="394" REF="406">
di&s;tant nation, becau&s;e they differ from our own. Yet it mu&s;t not be denied, that in critici&s;m, as in human nature, there are certain univer&s;al axioms, which are independent of every local cu&s;tom. Order mu&s;t ever be acknow|ledged &s;uperior to confu&s;ion, decency to licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;implicity to af|fectation; the cla&s;&s;ical &s;chool has, therefore, &s;ucce&s;sfully attacked many a vulnerable &s;ide of the Gothic poets. To the&s;e children of fancy, Fairy Land opened all it's gorgeous miracles, and as the dragon of critici&s;m was not placed at the entrance of the poetical He&s;perides, they plucked, at plea&s;ure, the golden fruitage, and &s;ported with the freedom, and &s;ometimes with the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of revellers, who di&s;|dained the arm of the legi&s;lator. But it was not thus in France; critici&s;m had flouri&s;hed there at an early period, and the art of poetry had long exer|ci&s;ed the colder and di&s;qui&s;itive genius
<PB N="395" REF="407">
of their wits; Ari&s;totle became as great a favourite as Homer. And it is an acknowledged fact in literary inve&s;ti|gation, that whenever critici&s;m flou|ri&s;hes, a &s;evere and minute ta&s;te will be formed, and the luxuriancies of imagination mu&s;t be trimmed and lopped by the poli&s;hing &s;teel of art.</P>
<P>Hence is it, that &s;o many extraor|dinary critici&s;ms have appeared by &s;ome eminent writers of both nations. Boileau and Racine, two mo&s;t fini&s;hed poets, have been often &s;lightly appreci|ated in our country; the cla&s;&s;ical puri|ty, and the bitter cau&s;ticity of Boileau, have &s;ometimes been con&s;idered as only frigid imitation; and the equable flow, and concealed delicacy of Racine, have not been generally ta&s;ted in a country, where energy, rather than delicacy, is found mo&s;t to plea&s;e. Voltaire's Henriade has been little e&s;teemed, and denied to be an epic, but I cannot ap|prove it the le&s;s, if it were merely to
<PB N="396" REF="408">
de&s;erve the degrading di&s;tinction, of being only a very fine poem.</P>
<P>But the Engli&s;h Mu&s;es have fared much wor&s;e at Paris, than their French Si&s;ters at London. Our brilliant mon|&s;ters, as the works of Milton and Shake&s;peare have been called by Vol|taire, is a favourable di&s;tinction. The French have tran&s;lated our be&s;t poets in pro&s;e and ver&s;e; and when we com|pare the&s;e ver&s;ions with the originals, we &s;hall be little &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;eve|rity of critici&s;m. The brighte&s;t pa&s;|&s;ages in Shake&s;peare and Milton, are &s;o clo&s;ely attached to the force and genius of our language; &s;o many &s;e|cret charms are concealed in their numbers; &s;o many marvellous words that are embrowned by the touch of antiquity; &s;o many happy boldne&s;&s;es of expre&s;&s;ion; and &s;uch a continuance of metaphorical diction; that I am per&s;uaded no foreign &s;tudent can ever ta&s;te them, like a native, in their ori|ginal.
<PB N="397" REF="409">
There are certain poets, who re&s;i&s;t the nice&s;t &s;kill of tran&s;lation; who refu&s;e to &s;peak in any other language than their own, and who have &s;o con|&s;tructed their diction, by the idiom and manners of their own country, that not a &s;ufficient number of equivalent phra&s;es, or colours of diction, can be found by a foreigner in his own lan|guage. When by violence we tear away the &s;entiment or image, to place it in another language, it is like rend|ing the embroidered flower from a veil of gauze; the flower may be &s;ei&s;ed on, but the gauze which gave it it's peculiar beauty will be wanting.</P>
<P>What we have ob&s;erved of this kind of imagination, extends al&s;o to works of humour. There is an idiom in the manners of men, as well as in their language. We are not le&s;s di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by our national humour, than by our national imagination; and the fine&s;t &s;trokes in the characters of Sir

John Fal&s;taff and Sir Roger de Cover|ley, I can &s;peak from my own ob&s;er|vation, can never be reli&s;hed by a man of letters in France; and I may add, that the wit of Moliere will not be certain of &s;ecuring every Engli&s;hman as his admirer. It is not, therefore, &s;urpri&s;ing, that mo&s;t of the French tran&s;lators, have re&s;cinded from many of our authors, tho&s;e portions of their compo&s;itions, which are mo&s;t valued by a native.</P>
<P>But to return to our pre&s;ent inve&s;ti|gation. Writers of the Gothic cha|racter we have mentioned, add to the&s;e difficulties, that of opening a vein of purer poetry, which is unknown in the &s;chool of wit and correctne&s;s. The mo&s;t enlightened critic of the &s;everer, wants many &s;en&s;ations for the roman|tic poetry.</P>
<P>It has therefore happened, that &s;ome of our own eminent writers, in the character of critics, have delivered

Mr. Nares has &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"The whole book, if it <HI>performs</HI> what it's compiler intends"</Q>&mdash;it &s;hould be <Q REND="inline">"if it <HI>per|form,</HI>"</Q> the conjunction <HI>if,</HI> ob&s;erves Lowth, making the &s;en&s;e hypothetical or conditional, always governs the verb in the &s;ubjunctive mood. Again our author writes <Q REND="inline">"This letter has <HI>one uniform</HI> &s;ound."</Q> This barbarous tautology may be ea&s;ily avoided, if we read <Q REND="inline">"<HI>an uniform</HI> &s;ound."</Q>&mdash;But I &s;top my pen, a&s;hamed in a work of &s;o &s;trong a texture, to pick out &s;uch loo&s;e threads. I mean, however, that this note &s;hould be in&s;tructive; we &s;ee our be&s;t authors claim great indulgence. It is the artifice of &s;ome critics, of very mean talents, to direct their acumen to &s;uch venial errors; incapable of valuing the powers of a man of genius, they exult in &s;uch mechanical detec|tions; they almo&s;t appear to con&s;ider genius as con|&s;i&s;ting in grammar; as tho&s;e hypocrites vigilantly cen&s;ure the virtues of an elevated &s;oul, becau&s;e not as &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly punctilious as them&s;elves, in the mi|nuter ceremonies of religion; all the grammar po&s;&s;i|ble will not produce one valuable &s;entiment, as all the ceremonies of religion will not give birth to one &s;ublime virtue.</P></NOTE><PB N="411" REF="423">

<P>I AM inclined to believe, that of tho&s;e minor poems which I have de|&s;cribed, a diligent &s;election among our fugitive poetry, might gather no in|con&s;iderable volume.

<P>I confe&s;s, however, that every phi|lo&s;opher is not &s;o indifferent a prophet as the good Abb&eacute; de Saint Pierre. We have had &s;everal extracts from their writings, which have clearly pre|dicted
<PB N="414" REF="426">
the great revolution of France. To this number I could add many; I &s;hall give a very &s;ingular prediction of Rou&s;&s;eau, who, whether the Church will allow it or not, is certainly a very great prophet.</P>
<P>In his Emilius, book iii. p. 88, he writes. <Q REND="inline">"We approach a &s;tate of cri&s;is, and an age of revolutions. Who can an&s;wer what will then happen to you? What men have made, men can de&s;troy; there are no other indelible characters than tho&s;e formed by na|ture, and nature makes no princes, no rich, no lords. What then will your deba&s;ed &s;atrap do, who has been only habituated to grandeur?"</Q>&mdash;He accom|panies the ob&s;ervation by this note.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I con&s;ider it as impo&s;&s;ible, that the great monarchies of Europe can la&s;t long; they have all &s;hone, and every &s;tate that &s;hines, is on the decline. I could maintain my opinion by rea&s;ons more particular than this maxim; but
<PB N="415" REF="427">
this is not the place to tell them."</Q> All this might appear very wonderful, if it were not certain that the revolu|tion in France had taken place, in the eye of the philo&s;opher, thirty or forty years, ere it appeared in the &s;treets of Paris. A revolution in a great king|dom has been long formed when it fir&s;t appears to the common people. It would not be difficult, at the pre|&s;ent moment, to offer &s;ome <HI>predictions</HI> re&s;pecting our&s;elves, which would not be of an agreeable nature. But I &s;hall &s;ay with Rou&s;&s;eau, this is not their place; and men do not like to be in|formed even of inevitable di&s;a&s;ters. It is with revolutions, as with thunder clouds; the danger has pa&s;t when the noi&s;e is heard; while the people com|plain, there is &s;ome faint hope of quiet; when they are &s;ullen and &s;ilent, it is then the lightning of vengeance darts it's fatal &s;troke.

<P>IT will not be denied, that Era&s;mus was a friend to the freedom of the pre&s;s; who, indeed, had employed it more than him&s;elf? Yet he was &s;o &s;hocked at the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of Lu|ther's pen, that there was a time when he con&s;idered it as nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;train the liberty of the pre&s;s. He had in|deed been mi&s;erably calumniated, and expected future libels. I am glad, however, to ob&s;erve, that he after|wards, on a more impartial inve&s;tiga|tion, confe&s;&s;ed that &s;uch a remedy was much more dangerous than the di&s;ea&s;e. To re&s;train the liberty of the pre&s;s, can only be the intere&s;t of the individual, never that of the public.</P>

I have ju&s;t di&s;covered in the Notes on Pope's Ody&s;&s;ey. Homer has been ridiculed by certain critics, for having &s;o minutely de&s;cribed the dog Argus, lying on a dung hill, nearly devoured by vermin.&mdash;The annotator then ob|&s;erves, <Q REND="inline">"It is certain that the <HI>vermin</HI> which Homer mentions, would de|ba&s;e our poetry; but in the Greek, that very <HI>word</HI> is <HI>noble</HI> and <HI>&s;onorous,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">."</Q>&mdash;Here then is a word which can give dignity to a circum&s;tance very offen&s;ive in it&s;elf; but we cannot at pre&s;ent, I think, decide whether this word, which appears to us &s;o noble and &s;onorous, affected an ancient Greek in the &s;ame manner. All that appears certain, is, that the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> of Homer, and the <HI>excalcearetur</HI> and <HI>di&s;|cingeretur</HI> of Velleius Paterculus, are noble and &s;onorous terms to our ear, and abate from the familiarity of ex|pre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="418" REF="430">
Lord Kaimes, in his "Sketches of the Hi&s;tory of Man," vol. iii. p. 242, has a curious ob&s;ervation, which &s;eems to relate to this &s;ubject, though by him applied to a different purpo&s;e. He writes, <Q REND="inline">"A &s;ea-pro&s;pect is charming, but we &s;oon tire of an unbounded pro&s;pect. It would not give &s;atisfac|tion to &s;ay, that it is too exten&s;ive; for why &s;hould not a pro&s;pect be reli&s;hed, however exten&s;ive?"</Q> But employ <HI>a foreign term,</HI> and &s;ay that it is <HI>trop va&s;te,</HI> we enquire no further; <HI>a term that is not familiar, makes an impre&s;&s;ion, and cap|tivates weak rea&s;on.</HI> This ob&s;ervation accounts for a mode of writing for|merly in common u&s;e, that of &s;tuffing our language with Latin words and phra&s;es.</P>
<P>I only quote Lord Kaimes, for the purpo&s;e of &s;hewing the effect of ex|pre&s;&s;ions that are not familiar. His in&s;tance of the &s;ea appears to me erro|neous; for we do not tire of the pro&s;|pect
<PB N="419" REF="431">
of interminable waters, for the <HI>exten&s;ivene&s;s,</HI> but the <HI>uniformity.</HI> The Alps, like the ocean, pre&s;ent <HI>exten&s;ive pro&s;pects,</HI> but delight, becau&s;e they have al&s;o innumerable <HI>varieties.</HI></P>
<P>The reader will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, that the affectation I cen&s;ure in Vel|leius, is not the words <HI>excalcearetur</HI> and <HI>di&s;cingeretur,</HI> but the <HI>pompous parenthe&s;is,</HI> in which he apologi&s;es for mentioning the&s;e circum&s;tances. I have mi&s;under|&s;tood the de&s;ign of Ce&s;ar, and have erroneou&s;ly called that <Q REND="inline">"a petty pre|caution,"</Q> which is really a very noble action. This mi&s;take has been cor|rected by a learned friend. It does not affect my critici&s;m, re&s;pecting the two words. I &s;hall, however, give the tran&s;lation of my friend, accompa|nied by &s;ome ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nor was he ever, either by night or day, (for why &s;hould any thing of the <HI>greate&s;t kind</HI> be omitted, becau&s;e it
<PB N="420" REF="432">
cannot be expre&s;&s;ed in beautiful lan|guage?) <HI>un&s;lippered</HI> or <HI>ungirdled.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>The hi&s;torian has told us before, that when Ce&s;ar was threatened with death by the &s;ervile in&s;truments of Sylla, he put on a mean habit, and e&s;caped by night. This was a nece&s;|&s;ary mea&s;ure. But among the pirates who treated him with re&s;pect, and where (as the hi&s;torian expre&s;&s;es it) he was only guarded by the eye, he would not occa&s;ion them to &s;u&s;pect that he would make u&s;e of any di&s;gui&s;e to e&s;cape. He therefore altered not the minute&s;t article of his dre&s;s, but appeared before their eyes always the &s;ame. This circum&s;tance was, there|fore, no <Q REND="inline">"petty precaution,"</Q> but an action which &s;hewed Ce&s;ar's dignity of mind, and &s;en&s;ibility of honour, and was, as the hi&s;torian terms it, <Q REND="inline">"quod vel <HI>maximum</HI> e&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>The affectation and ob&s;curity of Velleius, may lead minds much more
<PB N="421" REF="433">
vigorous than my own a&s;tray. But it is a ju&s;tice we owe to Ce&s;ar, to cor|rect even a mi&s;repre&s;entation as incon|&s;iderable as the pre&s;ent. The reader will ob&s;erve, that I have only erred in the conception of the hi&s;torical fact; the critici&s;m relative to Velleius re|mains uninjured.</P>

<P>ROUSSEAU is the adver&s;ary of this &s;y&s;tem; he adopts the popular notion that the aptitude of men, for the un|der&s;tanding merely depends on their re&s;pective organi&s;ation, and their vir|tues, on their temperaments. The French Plato, it is well known, con|tradicts him&s;elf throughout his works; and on no &s;ubject &s;o much as on the pre&s;ent. Helvetius has collected his contradictions; the &s;ure&s;t and the mo&s;t mode&s;t mode of confuting a writer of the fine&s;t genius. He has al&s;o thrown out an ob&s;ervation, which di&s;clo&s;es
<PB N="422" REF="434">
the &s;ource of the errors of Rou&s;&s;eau. He &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"The contradictions of this celebrated writer are not to be won|dered at. His <HI>ob&s;ervations</HI> are almo&s;t always <HI>ju&s;t;</HI> and his <HI>principles</HI> almo&s;t always <HI>falfe</HI> and <HI>trite.</HI> From hence his errors. Little &s;crupulous in examin|ing opinions generally received, the number of tho&s;e he adopts, impo&s;e on him."</Q></P>
<P>We &s;ee the opinion of Reynolds, on the genius for painting; we &s;hall con|tra&s;t it with that of Rou&s;&s;eau; and we may then enquire, if, on this &s;ubject, the opinion of a philo&s;opher and a painter is not to be preferred to him who only was a philo&s;opher.</P>
<P>Rou&s;&s;eau, in his Emilius, book iii. p. 100, amu&s;es his readers with an anecdote. He tells us, he was ac|quainted with a &s;ervant, who having frequently ob&s;erved his ma&s;ter paint and de&s;ign, felt a furious pa&s;&s;ion to become a painter and de&s;igner. He
<PB N="423" REF="435">
pa&s;&s;ed three years, nailed to his chair, in painting and de&s;igning; and nothing but <HI>attendance on his ma&s;ter,</HI> could take him away from his plea&s;ing occupa|tions. At length favoured by his ma&s;ter, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the in&s;tructions of an arti&s;t, he quitted his livery, and lived by the produce of his pencil.&mdash;I &s;hall now quote the very expre&s;&s;ions our author employs, <Q REND="inline">"Till a certain point, per&s;everance &s;uffices in lieu of genius; he has reached this point, and will never pa&s;s it. The con&s;tancy and emulation of this hone&s;t man are lau|dable; but he will never paint but for &s;ign-po&s;ts."</Q> I refer the reader to the original for other ob&s;ervations, while I &s;hall make one my&s;elf on this anec|dote.</P>
<P>It is with facts like the&s;e, that the &s;y&s;tem I have adopted is ever comba|ted; but I could never &s;ee in one of the&s;e facts, any thing which could &s;uf|fer an inve&s;tigation. Here is a young
<PB N="424" REF="436">
man, who has already attained a cer|tain age, who is in the daily &s;ervice of his ma&s;ter, and who, without prepa|ratory in&s;tructions, or various models, feels <Q REND="inline">"the eager di&s;po&s;ition,"</Q> and the nece&s;&s;ary <Q REND="inline">"a&s;&s;iduity."</Q> But both the di&s;po&s;ition and the a&s;&s;iduity are very imperfect. An arti&s;t who is ince&s;|&s;antly performing dome&s;tic bu&s;ine&s;s, mu&s;t be cla&s;&s;ed among tho&s;e, who&s;e moral &s;ituation infallibly enfeebles, and almo&s;t annihilates, genius. This young man, had he known no other &s;ervice, but his art, and no other ma&s;ter, but a Reynolds, it is not improbable, with his di&s;po&s;ition and a&s;&s;iduity, might have become a great arti&s;t. All this only tends to prove, that the great dif|ficulty of becoming a man of genius, con&s;i&s;ts, among others, in his moral &s;ituation; and that no footman has any chance of becoming a great arti&s;t.</P>
<P>Re&s;pecting the idea of Rou&s;&s;eau, that our virtues or our vices are derived
<PB N="425" REF="437">
from our temperament; I mu&s;t ju&s;t ob|&s;erve, that if &s;ometimes they do, often many are acquired from moral cau&s;es. There appears nothing &s;upernatural in the notion, that a &s;on inherits the qua|lity of the blood of his parents. I have ob&s;erved, a per&s;on born of a choleric father, and a &s;aturnine mother, unite the&s;e qualities, &s;eemingly incompati|ble; &s;ometimes warm and generous as the father, and &s;ometimes frigid and cautious as the mother. Yet, even in this in&s;tance, we might &s;how that the effects of this character, can be derived from the manners and habits with which the &s;on has long been familiar|i&s;ed. Another &s;on of the &s;ame family, having been ab&s;ent from home at an early period, and re&s;iding, for the greater part of his life, in France, was a being totally different from the ge|nerous father, the cautious mother, and the brother at once choleric and &s;aturnine.</P>

<P>AFTER what is mentioned of Dyer, in&s;ert this paragraph.</P>
<P>Warburton, in his anonymous "Cri|tical and Philo&s;ophical Enquiry into the Prodigies, &amp;c. of Hi&s;torians," in a concluding note, alluding to the emi|nent &s;ucce&s;s of the French, in tran&s;la|tions of the ancients, imagines that our little emulation, in this department of literature, may be attributed to the <HI>coldne&s;s</HI> of our <HI>climate.</HI> I tran&s;cribe his words. <Q REND="inline">"The Frenchman, vigorous and enterpri&s;ing, is ambitious of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion; while we, with a fal&s;e <HI>mode&s;ty</HI> and <HI>coldne&s;s,</HI> natural from our <HI>climate,</HI> content our&s;elves with a di&s;tant admi|ration."</Q></P>

<PB N="427" REF="439">
and Mr. Beloe have received the gratitude of the Engli&s;h reader. The ample and entertaining commentary which the latter has be&s;towed on Au|lus Gellius, gives a new value to this &s;pecies of literature, and &s;ugge&s;ts this reflection on &s;uch tran&s;lations. Wri|ters &s;o exqui&s;ite as Pliny, require no other decorations than the eloquence which is in&s;pired by the felicities of their diction; but authors not remark|able for their di&s;cernment or their deli|cacy, yet abounding with information, like Aulus Gellius, exact from their tran&s;lators, the adventitious art of &s;cat|tering an attractive amu&s;ement in co|pious notes. It is thus that a tran&s;la|tion may be rendered more valuable than the original.</P>
<P>Since I am on the &s;ubject of cla&s;&s;ical tran&s;lations, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that a ju|dicious &s;election from Athenaeus re|mains a de&s;ideratum; and the French have both an ancient and modern ver|&s;ion

<P>A tran&s;lation of Plutarch's Morals has long been rumoured.

<P>Warburton, whatever his learning, and however great his ability, owed his reputation to his bold paradoxes.
