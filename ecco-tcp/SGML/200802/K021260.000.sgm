<P>Alas! Madam, my Injuries are of a different Na|ture. The Fall that I feigned to have receiv'd from my Hor&s;e, as I was travelling homewards, was no|thing more than a contrived Excu&s;e for concealing my|&s;elf in the&s;e Parts. In &s;hort, Madam, I am not what I &s;eem.</P>

<P>What do I hear? Was Frederick, was young Withers thus ingrateful, thus in&s;en&s;ible? Let me hope, Amelia, there is &s;ome Mi&s;apprehen&s;ion in this Matter: I know his Intimacy with your Brother, and that he made him a Vi&s;it this Summer of &s;ome Continuance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was then, Madam, that my poor Bo&s;om lo&s;t that peaceful Indifference it had ever before enjoyed. My Family were then in Treaty with the Per&s;on I men|tioned to you before: intoxicated with his extravagant Offers, they omitted no Mea&s;ures to engage me to ac|cept his Addre&s;&s;es; nay they were de&s;perate enough to employ Frederick to &s;olicit me: but alas! their Advocate ruined their Cau&s;e; my Heart fir&s;t con+ceived a Di&s;ta&s;te to Lord Wealthy, and the Interpo&s;i|tion of young Withers confirm'd me in my Aver&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>But did Frederick betray his Commi&s;&s;ion by turning it to his own Advantage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot charge him with that Di&s;honour; therein I mu&s;t condemn my&s;elf: it was my own fond un|guarded
<PB N="10" REF="10">
Heart that told him too plainly what it felt; till one fatal Moment my Father &s;urpriz'd him kneel|ing at my Feet, and the next tran&s;ported him from my Sight for ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Relation, my dear Amelia, is truly pitiable; but as you know not what Motives Frederick had for &s;o abruptly leaving you, &s;o I think you cannot po&s;itively charge him with Infidelity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Madam, how kindly you con&s;ole me! I own to you I have &s;ome Hopes that Frederick &s;till remembers me, and &s;till loves me: tho&s;e Hopes conducted me hither; I find he is this Day expected home; this Event and Sir Antony's ridiculous A&s;&s;iduities make it no longer po&s;&s;ible for me to conceal my&s;elf at his Te|nant's. I mu&s;t therefore retire till by &s;ome means I can di&s;cover the real State of Frederick's Heart. What I have to entreat of you, Madam, is, for a &s;hort Time to afford me the Protection of your Hou&s;e.</P>

<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mo&s;t gladly, my dear, let us betake our&s;elves thither this In&s;tant, before he comes and &s;urprizes you. Come, my Chariot is now at the Door.</P>
