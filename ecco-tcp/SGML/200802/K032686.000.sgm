<DIV1 TYPE="introduction">
<P>_THE Doctrine of a Sinner's Ju&s;tification in the Sight of God, whether by Faith or good Works, is a Point that has often exerci&s;ed the Pen of Controver|&s;y; but, except at this pre&s;ent Time, &s;carcely, if ever, was it known, that any Author or Preacher departed &s;o far from the Truth, as to run into &s;uch loo&s;e, un&s;criptural and licentious Principles, as to maintain that <HI>either,</HI> much le&s;s <HI>both</HI> Faith and good Works, are excluded by the Chri&s;tian Doctrine, as unnece&s;&s;ary to eternal Life and Salvation. Methinks, one &s;hould be tender of entertaining &s;o bad an Opinion of the Prin|ciples of any Profe&s;&s;or of Chri&s;tianity, and exceedingly cautious of fixing &s;uch a gro&s;s and unchri&s;tian Charge upon any one who takes upon him&s;elf to be a Preacher of the Go&s;pel of Holine&s;s: Yet &s;uch is the peculiar <HI>Here&s;y</HI> of this Day: For that &s;uch Doctrine, is openly in the Face of the Sun, avowed, preached and publi&s;hed, we have too many unhappy In&s;tances to prove; both the Pulpit and Pre&s;s &s;end forth the&s;e wild, extravagant and antichri&s;tian Notions; than which nothing is more contrary to the Doctrines of the Go&s;pel, more &s;ubver|&s;ive of the Truths of GOD, and more naturally leads to Pre&s;umption, vain Confidence and Delu&s;ion of Soul; tends to harden Men i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> a State of Sinfulne&s;s, and to cheri&s;h and e&s;tabli&s;h the Practice of Profanene&s;s, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n utter contempt of GOD's Word and Ordinances, and a total neg|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ect of the Means of Grace.

To &s;hew how far Mr. <HI>Relly</HI> is concerned in, and an&s;werable for the Ob&s;ervations I have made, is my pre&s;ent De&s;ign. In his Treati&s;e entitled UNION, This Gentleman's erroneous Principles, and the licentious Doc|trines he maintains, are very plain and evident.

<HEAD>CHAPTER. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>The glorious Oeconomy of Salvation di&s;played, in the Grace of the Holy Trinity. The Father's Love in the Gift of his Son for his People. The Love of Je&s;us in their Redemption and Ju&s;tification, and the Spirit's Energy on their Hearts, producing Repentance, Faith and Holine&s;s, laid down as con&s;i&s;tent with the Scripture, illu&s;trated from Nature, and the Fruits and Effects demon&s;trable in Oppo&s;i|tion to the pre&s;ent</HI> Antinomian <HI>un&s;criptural Tenets.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE only meritorious and procuring Cau&s;e of the Ju&s;tifica|tion, Pardon, and Salvation of Sinners, is the Life and Death atoning Blood, and &s;potle&s;s Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the GOD-man Je&s;us Chri&s;t&punc;
<PB REF="4">
This is the peculiar and di&s;tingui&s;hing Doctrine of the Go&s;pel of the Grace of GOD. Therefore it has been received and gloried in as &s;uch, by the People of GOD in every Age of the Chri&s;tian Church. But that it follows from hence, that Sinners are made Partakers of Glory, Hap|pine&s;s and eternal Life, without <HI>Repentance, Faith</HI> and <HI>Holine&s;s,</HI> is ab&s;o|lutely denied, it being contrary to the Purpo&s;e and Will of GOD, as it is clearly revealed and fully expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;acred Pages: For, the very End and De&s;ign of our Lord's coming in the Fle&s;h, was to purcha&s;e and pro|cure for his People, the out-pouring of the Holy Spirit, under who&s;e divine Energy and &s;overeign Influences upon their Hearts, they are enabled to repent, believe and become obedient to the Go&s;pel of their Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Repentance, Faith and Holine&s;s, are the <HI>Graces</HI> and Ble&s;&s;ings of the new Covenant. Every Member of Je&s;us is made a Partaker of them. His Blood and Righteou&s;ne&s;s entitles them to the Kingdom of Glory, and by the&s;e Graces their Souls are qualified and prepared for the Enjoyment of it: And it is exceeding plain and ob|vious from the Tenor of Scripture, that the Love and Grace of GOD the Father and our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is magnified, manife&s;ted, and di&s;played, by and thro' the Holy Spirit's Agency, in quickning, regenerating and &s;anctifying the Souls of the Elect, as fully and as truly, as the Love of the Father is di&s;played by the Gift of his Son, or the Grace of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour in giving him&s;elf a Sacrifice for their Sins, and re|deeming them to GOD by his precious Blood.</P>
<P>Indeed, the Gift of Je&s;us Chri&s;t for lo&s;t Sinners, is the Re&s;ult of that Love, which dwelt in the Brea&s;t of GOD the Father from all Eter|nity to his People. And the Gift of the Holy Spirit to enlighten their Minds and &s;anctify their Souls, is in Con&s;equence of Chri&s;t having undertook and fini&s;hed the Work of their Redemption. Je&s;us being now gone to the Father, according to his mo&s;t true Promi&s;e, &s;ends the Comforter. Je&s;us being glorified as the Head, the Spirit de&s;cends on his Members, to accompli&s;h and produce &s;uch &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings upon the Heart, and in the Life of the Heirs of Promi&s;e, which Mr. <HI>Relly</HI> is plea&s;ed entirely to explode and deny, to treat with the utmo&s;t con|tempt, and to &s;tigmatize, as the Marks of the <HI>fal&s;e Chri&s;t,</HI> and the Workings of the <HI>Spirit of Antichri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Without this inward Work upon the Heart, under the &s;overeign and vital Operations of the Holy Spirit; it is plain from GOD's Word, and the Condition of Mankind in its Fallen State; as al&s;o from the Experience and Te&s;timony of the People of GOD, in every Age of the Church, from <HI>Adam</HI> to <HI>Me&s;es,</HI> from <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to Chri&s;t, and from Chri&s;t to this Day, that no Man is able of him&s;elf to turn to GOD,
<PB REF="5">
by true Repentance, to <HI>believe with his Heart unto Righteou&s;|ne&s;s,</HI> or to bring forth <HI>Fruit unto Holine&s;s,</HI> unto eternal Life. And if the Soul is de&s;titute of the&s;e Graces, Profe&s;&s;ion is vain and in&s;igni|ficant. Notions and Opinions are lighter than Vanity. Knowledge is but pompous Ignorance, and, as yet, the Go&s;pel preached, has affec|ted &s;uch a Profe&s;&s;or no more than outward Sound. For, <HI>except ye re|pent, ye &s;hall peri&s;h,</HI> Luke xiii. 3. <HI>He that believeth not &s;hall be damned,</HI> Mark xvi. 16. <HI>And without Holine&s;s no Man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord,</HI> Heb. xii. 14. The&s;e Declarations from our Saviour him&s;elf, and from the Spirit of Truth, will be an eternal Bar to the Salvation and Glory of every Soul that dies in an impenitent, unbelieving, unholy State, notwith&s;tanding all the &s;oft Ca&s;ui&s;try, and artful Sophi&s;try of liber|tine Deceivers.</P>
<P>From GOD's fir&s;t creating that great Luminary the Sun, its power|ful Shining, invigorating Rays, enlightening and enlivening Influ|ences, have &s;hed a genial Warmth and prolific Energy upon the whole Creation, whereby all Nature appears with Chearfulne&s;s, and is enriched with Fruitfulne&s;s: And, no &s;ooner did the Glory of the <HI>Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> begin to dawn, after the Darkne&s;s and Mi&s;ery of the Fall of Man, but with &s;piritual and heavenly Rays, Je&s;us enlightened, quickened, animated and refre&s;hed the Hearts of his People, producing Chearfulne&s;s and Joy in their Soul, and Fruitful|ne&s;s of the heavenly Graces in their Life and Practice. By Virtue of their Union with Chri&s;t as the Source of Life, and Fountain of In|fluence, Believers <HI>receive out of his Fulne&s;s Grace for Grace:</HI> But more e&s;pecially under the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation, the Power and In|fluence of the Holy Spirit, is manife&s;ted with &s;uperior Energy and meridian Brightne&s;s; hence is the Go&s;pel emphatically &s;tiled <HI>the Mini&s;tration of the Spirit,</HI> 2 Cor. iii. 8.</P>
<P>Now to allow of the Power and Influence which the Sun hath upon the Earth, and yet to deny that Life and Fruitfulne&s;s are communi|cated to the natural World by his impregnating Rays, is contrary both to Rea&s;on and Ob&s;ervation in natural Things. So in &s;piritual Matters, to contend for the Union of the Soul with Je&s;us, the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and yet deny that &s;piritual Life and Fruitfulne&s;s, is thereby communicated to his Members, is repugnant both to Scripture and Experience. And yet, however ab&s;urd and irrational this Notion is, &s;uch is Mr. <HI>Relly</HI>'s avowed Tenet. Yea, it is plain and obvious from the whole Drift of this Author's Treati&s;e, that he denies and explodes what the Scripture maintains, namely, that the Mem|bers of Je&s;us, are influenced to per&s;onal Holine&s;s, or, (to u&s;e Scrip|ture
<PB N="7" REF="6">
Language) that they ever do or can, bring forth <HI>the Fruits of Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> Phil. i. 11. <HI>Fruit unto Holine&s;s,</HI> Rom. vi. 22. <HI>Fruit unto GOD,</HI> chap. vii. 4. in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But well would it be for this Author, and for all tho&s;e who oppo&s;e the plain Truths of GOD, in this Point, did they but con&s;ider this &s;criptural Di&s;tinction, though Believers bring forth Fruit unto GOD, <HI>in</HI> them&s;elves, yet not <HI>of</HI> and <HI>from</HI> them&s;elves. Their <HI>Sufficiency to every good Word and Work is of GOD.</HI> Being united to the Lord Je&s;us, they receive, Life, Strength and Power out of his Fulne&s;s. They are taught by his Word, influenced by his Spirit, to live to the Glory of GOD. They partake of Holine&s;s in and from the Lord Je&s;us, whereby, they are enabled to produce the Fruits of Holine&s;s and good Works in their Lives and Conver&s;ations. Though the Fruits which they bear and bring forth, do not make them holy, or are the Cau&s;e of their Holine&s;s, any more than the Grapes which grow on the Vine, make or con&s;titute it a Vine, or are the Source and Cau&s;e of its Fruitfulne&s;s; yet, &s;uch Fruits, which are agreeable to the Word of GOD, and produced <HI>in and by them,</HI> thro' the Grace and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Spirit of GOD, prove and evidence, that they are new Creatures in Chri&s;t Je&s;us: That their Souls are born again of the Spirit of GOD: That they <HI>live in the Spirit,</HI> are <HI>led by the Spirit, and bring forth the Fruits of the Spirit.</HI> Yea, being made good Trees, they bring forth good Fruit; and &s;o an&s;wer our Lord's De&s;cription, <HI>By their Fruits ye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">all know them,</HI> Matt. viii. 20. But, I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to &s;peak more fully to this Point as I proceed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Mr.</HI> Relly<HI>'s ab&s;urd Notion of Univer&s;al Salvation exploded, as un|&s;criptural; fal&s;e Quotation, and corrupt Glo&s;s put upon Scripture to maintain it, detected.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Shall here pre&s;ent my Reader, with a Quotation from Mr. <HI>Relly's Treati&s;e of Union,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>page</HI> 125, and 126. a very &s;triking one indeed! It contains (I think) the mo&s;t unparallelled Ab&s;urdity, &s;hock|ing Perver&s;ion of the Meaning, and the mo&s;t licentious Comment that ever was put upon the Words of Scripture: <Q REND="inline">"The Apo&s;tle &s;aith (according to Mr. <HI>Relly</HI>'s Quotation) <HI>that GOD hath given to us eter|nal Life, and that this Life is in his Son; and that he who believeth not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">is Record hath made GOD a Liar.</HI>"</Q> From whence, &s;aith Mr. <HI>Relly,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="7">
<Q REND="inline">"it is plain, that he who believeth not, hath eternal Life given him in the Son of GOD, as fully as him who believeth."</Q> It is plain! Ju&s;t as plain, as that the&s;e Words inform us, Mr. <HI>Relly</HI> is an <HI>Iri&s;h Bi&s;hop.</HI> Reader, I appeal to your Judgment. Does any Thing like it appear from the Words of the Apo&s;tle? Is not this Conclu&s;ion the mo&s;t forced and unnatural; an Inference or Deduction quite Foreign to the Sen&s;e of the Apo&s;tle? For the beloved Di&s;ciple in the very next Ver&s;e a&s;&s;erts, <HI>he that hath not the Son, hath not Life:</HI> Therefore, &s;o far from its being plain, that there is not the lea&s;t Shadow of common Sen&s;e or Rea&s;on to &s;upport this Glo&s;s; but it is as contrary to the Apo&s;tle's Meaning, as Light is to Darkne&s;s, and Error to Truth. Amazing, that any Author &s;hould attempt to palm &s;uch glaring Ab&s;urdity, &s;uch palpable Fal&s;hood upon Mankind, for the Truths of Chri&s;tianity!</P>
<P>But to what End or Purpo&s;e is this fal&s;e Glo&s;s put upon the&s;e Words? It is to propagate a Notion which has no Foundation in the Word of GOD, but is utterly repugnant to it; <HI>viz.</HI> A Union of Sentiment, with the Author of a &s;ophi&s;tical, un&s;criptural Tract, entitled, <HI>Heaven open to all Men: or, a Theological Treati&s;e, proving that</HI> all Men <HI>&s;hall be &s;aved, and made finally happy.</HI> This Author's Theology, and Mr. <HI>Relly</HI>'s Notion in his <HI>Treati&s;e of Union,</HI> &amp;c. are quite &s;imilar. For the whole World con&s;i&s;ts but of two Sorts of Per&s;ons, Believers and Unbelievers. Now that Believers in Chri&s;t have eternal Life, is clear from the Word of GOD: And Mr. <HI>Relly</HI> a&s;&s;erts, he that believeth not, hath eternal Life, as fully as him who believeth; there|fore according to Mr. <HI>Relly, all Mankind,</HI> Believers and Unbelievers, &s;hall be &s;aved and made finally happy. Here lies the very Sinew of this Per&s;on's Delu&s;ion: Univer&s;al Salvation is the grand Ba&s;is upon which his Figment of UNION is founded. But this Path of Doctrine is unfrequented by any of the Saints of GOD: Never de|&s;cribed in the Word of GOD, therefore is truly, the Path of <HI>Singu|larity, Novelty,</HI> and <HI>Here&s;y.</HI> In the Sincerity of my Heart, I pray this Author may want Company, and enjoy Solitude and Retire|ment.</P>
<P>Let us have Recour&s;e to the &s;acred Oracles of Truth, and &s;hew the Incon&s;i&s;tency of this Notion with GOD's revealed Will, and then we will re&s;cue this Text from the fal&s;e and corrupt Opinion which it is brought to e&s;tabli&s;h. When our ble&s;&s;ed Lord gave that exten&s;ive Commi&s;&s;ion to his Apo&s;tles, to <HI>preach the Go&s;pel to every Creature,</HI> he pa&s;&s;es this Declaration as the certain Effect and Con&s;equence, <HI>He that believeth and is baptized &s;hall be &s;aved, but he that believeth not &s;hall be damned,</HI> Mark xvi. 16. Now will not Mr. <HI>Relly</HI> upon his
<PB N="9" REF="8">
Hypothe&s;is tell us, he that is damned, hath neverthele&s;s everla&s;ting Life in Chri&s;t as fully as he that is &s;aved? Again, our Saviour told the <HI>Jews, If ye believe not that I am he, ye &s;hall die in your Sins.</HI> John viii. 24. Which Sentence &s;tands forth again&s;t Unbelievers ha|ving eternal Life to this Day. But will Mr. <HI>Relly</HI> explain away our Lord's Meaning, and inform us, that tho&s;e who die in their Sins, yet have eternal Life in Chri&s;t? But our Lord in the &s;ame Chapter plain|ly a&s;&s;erts the contrary of &s;uch Per&s;ons, <HI>whither I go, ye cannot come.</HI> And the &s;ame Spirit who &s;pake by Je&s;us, hath by St. <HI>Paul,</HI> de&s;cribed the awful State of &s;ome, to whom the Go&s;pel is <HI>a Savour of Death unto Death,</HI> and of others who are <HI>lo&s;t, to whom the Go&s;pel is hid;</HI> and a&s;&s;igns this Rea&s;on for it, that <HI>the God of this World blinds the Minds of tho&s;e who believe not.</HI> And again he declares that <HI>the Lord Je&s;us &s;hall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels in flaming Fire, taking Vengeance on them that know not GOD, and that obey not the Go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; who &s;hall be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting De&s;truc|tion from the Pre&s;ence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power,</HI> 2 The&s;. i. 7, 8, 9. And once for all; for there is no End of quoting Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture to con&s;ute this impious and heretical Po&s;ition. Chri&s;t him&s;elf declares, <HI>he that believeth not, is condemned already.&mdash;He that believeth not the Son, &s;hall not &s;ee Life, but the Wrath of GOD abideth on him,</HI> John iii. 18. 30.</P>
<P>How can we reconcile a State of Wrath and Condemnation, with Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing GOD's Love and Favour; a lo&s;t State, and not &s;eeing Life, with having eternal Life; being puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting De&s;truction from GOD, and yet enjoying Salvation as his Gift fully given? The Bible hath no &s;uch Incon&s;i&s;tency: Nor in any Part of it doth it declare that Unbelievers have eternal Life, but quite the rever&s;e; nor doth it teach us to &s;uppo&s;e with the Author of <HI>Union,</HI> that all tho&s;e who &s;hall have their Portion with Unbelievers, to whom the Lord will denounce the awful Doom, <HI>depart ye Cur&s;ed,</HI> &amp;c. yet have eternal Life as fully given them in Chri&s;t, as tho&s;e <HI>who believe to the &s;aving their Souls,</HI> and on whom our Saviour will pronounce the joyful Sentence, <HI>come ye Ble&s;&s;ed of my Father,</HI> &amp;c. Surely before a Per&s;on can advance &s;uch Ab&s;urdity, he mu&s;t be <HI>given up to a &s;trong Delu&s;ion to believe a Lie,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and to wre&s;t the Scriptures to his own De&s;truction.</HI> It is no &s;mall Degree of Art and Sophi&s;try which this Author affects, &s;o as to explain away the true Sen&s;e and Mean|ing of the Scripture Language, and to dre&s;s it up in a fal&s;e Garb, and to give &s;uch a Turn to Scripture Phra&s;es, as be&s;t &s;uits a vitiated

<P>Let us now con&s;ider the plain Sen&s;e, and full Import of the Apo|&s;tles Meaning in that Pa&s;&s;age, which has been &s;o gro&s;sly perverted, and &s;hockingly corrupted, to &s;upport Fal&s;hood and Here&s;y. Far, very far from a fair and hone&s;t Quotation hath this Author given. He has tran&s;po&s;ed the Words o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Apo&s;tle. I &s;u&s;pect his De&s;ign hereby. It is the better to accommodate the Words, to &s;upport his Tenets. El&s;e, why &s;hould he not give his Readers the Words in the Order they are placed? Why has he exhibited them in a mangled, disjointed Form? My Rea&s;ons for Su&s;picion of Mr. <HI>Relly</HI>'s Method of quoting S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ripture, will, I think, be fully ju&s;tified pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tles Words, 1 <HI>John</HI> v. 10. <HI>He that believeth on the Son of GOD hath the Witne&s;s in him&s;elf,</HI> are plain; even the Witne&s;s of eternal
<PB N="11" REF="10">
Life, in and through the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And again, <HI>He that believeth not GOD, hath made him a Liar, becau&s;e he believeth not the Record which GOD hath given of his Son: i. e.</HI> that Sinners are &s;aved through Faith in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t only. It is good to compare Scripture with Scripture: And we have a Declaration from our Lord's own Mouth, which runs parallel with this, <HI>GOD &s;o loved the World, as to give his only begotten Son, that who&s;oever</HI> believeth <HI>on him, &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting Life,</HI> John iii. 16. Now on the contrary, he that <HI>believeth not,</HI> he denieth, oppo&s;eth, and rejecteth the Way of eternal Life and Salvation through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and &s;eeks for, and expects to find Righteou&s;ne&s;s in &s;ome other Way and Method, contrary to the Go&s;pel of the Grace of GOD: and thus he gives the Lie to the Record of Truth, the Report of the everla&s;ting Go&s;pel, yea to the GOD of Truth him&s;elf; than which nothing doth more enhance and aggravate the Sin of Unbelief. And therefore &s;o far from Unbe|lievers having eternal Life, they can in no Scripture Sen&s;e be &s;aid to have Part or Lot in the Matter; perhaps never may; nay, we are a&s;&s;ured never will, if they die in Unbelief. For as many as are Or|dained to eternal Life, BELIEVE. In Ver&s;e 11. the Apo&s;tle goes on, <HI>this is the Record that GOD hath given to US, eternal Life.</HI> To us! To whom? to all Mankind? No &s;uch thing, as appears very clear, if we con&s;ider to whom the Apo&s;tle is addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf. <HI>The&s;e Things write I unto you</HI> that believe <HI>on the Name of the Son of GOD, that ye may know that ye have eternal Life.</HI> Hence it is very plain and obvious, the Apo&s;tle was not writing to, nor &s;peaking of Un|believers at all, nor of all Mankind in General; for he afterwards fully declares the contrary, Ver&s;e 13. <HI>we know,</HI> (we who believe) <HI>that we are of GOD, and that the whole World lieth in Wickedne&s;s.</HI> Agree|able hereto, he &s;ays, <HI>he that hath the Son hath Life;</HI> &s;piritual Life: He is quickened by Je&s;us: Hath an experimental Knowledge of Chri&s;t by Faith: He hath the Earne&s;t of eternal Life: He dwells in Chri&s;t, and Chri&s;t in him: He is one with Chri&s;t, and Chri&s;t with him: (ble&s;&s;ed Union! not notional, but &s;criptural:) He &s;hall en|joy the Life of eternal Glory.&mdash;But <HI>he that hath not the Son of GOD, hath not Life;</HI> he is dead, dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins, de&s;titute of the Life of GOD in his Soul: He is ignorant of the Love of the Father: Hath no Knowledge of Chri&s;t's Love, and being de&s;titute of Faith in his Blood and Righteou&s;ne&s;s, has no right to eternal Life, nor any Mectne&s;s for it, but is under the &s;econd Death; if he abide in Unbelief, <HI>he &s;hall not &s;ee Life.</HI> So that nothing is more plain, than that, without Faith in Je&s;us, no Sinner can be &s;aved; and that eternal Salvation is connected with Faith.</P>

Such is the full Import, &s;uch the obvious Sen&s;e of the Apo&s;tle in this Pa&s;&s;age.

Singular and unparallelled this Ob&s;ervation! According to this Glo&s;s, here are two Believers in|tended by the Apo&s;tle, Chri&s;t and the Sinner, and Chri&s;t's Faith in|&s;tead of Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s, counted for Ju&s;tification. But can any Man of common Sen&s;e and Under&s;tanding, rather can any Chri&s;tian who has been taught <HI>the Truth as it is in Je&s;us,</HI> receive and admit &s;uch &s;trange and extravagant Flights of Fancy, for &s;olid Scripture Truths? Surely not.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t's Faith counted for Righteou&s;ne&s;s! no more than the Crown of Thorns or purple Robe which was put on Je&s;us in the Day of his Humiliation and Suffering, is counted for Righteou&s;ne&s;s. Who is it that ju&s;tifieth the Ungodly? <HI>it is GOD,</HI> &s;aith St. <HI>Paul.</HI> What is the procuring Cau&s;e of Ju&s;tification? the perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;potle&s;s Obedience of Je&s;us, who is the Surety for Sinners, and in their Nature, and on their Account, hath fulfilled all Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and yielded full Satisfaction to divine Ju&s;tice, and this is reckoned, counted, and imputed to every convinced Sinner <HI>who believeth on Je&s;us with his Heart unto Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> as the Scriptures te&s;tify, <HI>Rom.</HI> x. 10. Hence <HI>GOD is</HI> &s;aid to be <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> and <HI>the Ju&s;tifier</HI> (of whom?) <HI>of him who believes in Je&s;us,</HI> Rom. iii. 26. This is the plain Sen&s;e and Meaning of this Text. That the Phra&s;e, <HI>his Faith,</HI> hath no other Antecedent, but <HI>him,</HI> of whom the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>He worketh not, but believeth,</HI> is clear. And therefore this can have no Relation to Chri&s;t, but to him who believes, and works not to obtain Life: For this I appeal to every one who hath common Under&s;tanding to read.</P>
<P>This Author is plea&s;ed to tell us next, <Q REND="inline">"that <HI>Antichri&s;t</HI> &s;ays you are ju&s;tified by your own Faith, which will produce Righteou&s;ne&s;s in you to evidence it."</Q> This is a bold A&s;&s;ertion indeed! A &s;evere, if not a bla&s;phemous Cen&s;ure, not only levelled again&s;t the Writings of the in&s;pired Penmen, but al&s;o falls upon the Per&s;on and Doctrine of the Lamb of GOD him&s;elf, who &s;pake as never Man &s;pake, who taught the Doctrines of Repentance, Faith and Holine&s;s, as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to eternal Glory. Now Faith is &s;poken of and de&s;cribed in Scripture, not as any Work of Man, but as <HI>the Gift of GOD,</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="13">
wrought in the Heart of a Sinner by the Grace and Power of his Spirit. And therefore, as the Sinner is the Subject who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it, and as the Heart is the Seat of it, &s;o in this Sen&s;e, it may be called our <HI>own Faith:</HI> As any Gift, which is freely be&s;towed, may pro|perly be called, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ceiver's <HI>own,</HI> both as to Propriety of Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, as well as in the U&s;e, Comfort and Advantage which ari&s;es from it.</P>
<P>Thus in Scripture, this Phra&s;e, <HI>ju&s;tified by Faith,</HI> frequently occurs, <HI>Rom.</HI> v. 1. <HI>Being ju&s;tified by Faith,</HI> &amp;c. chap. iii. 28. <HI>we conclude, a Man is ju&s;tified by Faith,</HI> &amp;c.

O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> when we are &s;aid to be ju&s;tified <HI>by</HI> Faith, it is meant, that we are ju&s;tified <HI>for</HI> Faith, as though it was the meritorious or procuring Cau&s;e of Ju&s;tification in the Sight of GOD. No, that is effected by the perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Sacrifice and Blood-&s;hedding of the Lord Je&s;us <HI>only:</HI> And this being revealed, publi&s;hed, and declared by the Go&s;pel, as the only Refuge for lo&s;t and peri&s;hing Sinners to fly to. <HI>That</HI> ungodly Sinner, who is convinced of Sin, and is en|abled to have Recour&s;e to this Method, who tru&s;ts in, relies upon, and by Faith receives, applies, and appropriates Je&s;us Chri&s;t to his Soul, is thereby enriched with all the Privileges of the Go&s;pel; <HI>viz.</HI> Ju&s;tification, Pardon, Peace, Holine&s;s, and Salvation: ju&s;t as a Per&s;on is enriched by receiving any valuable Gift. So this Gift of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is apprehended and received by Faith, and is <HI>unto all, and upon all them who believe:</HI> They are delivered from the Guilt of Sin, freed from the Condemnation of the Law, and Righteou&s;ne&s;s is imputed to them through Faith: And thus in a &s;ound, Scripture Sen&s;e, Chri&s;t's People are actually ju&s;tified by Faith, as re&s;pecting, looking to, and receiving the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t Je&s;us. But every Soul who is de&s;titute of this Faith in Je&s;us, is in a State of Wrath, and under the Sentence of Condemnation by the ju&s;t and holy Law of GOD.

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>In Contradi&s;tinction to Mr.</HI> Relly<HI>'s Tenets, a Change of State and Practice &s;hewed to be nece&s;&s;ary to eternal Glory. That this is effected upon the Members of Je&s;us, to his Glory and their pre|&s;ent Happine&s;s and Holine&s;s, by the Power and Agency of the divine Spirit upon their Souls, whereby they are prepared and made meet for the heavenly Inheritance.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the la&s;t Chapter we have &s;een the Effects of a truly Chri&s;tian Faith rejected, in this we &s;hall &s;ee the Cau&s;e denied by thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Author, <HI>viz.</HI> that &s;piritual and &s;upernatural Change which pa&s;&s;eth upon the Heart and State of Believers under the Agency and Influence of the Holy Spirit, producing Repentance unto Life, Faith unto Ju&s;tifica|tion, and Sanctification unto Holine&s;s of Heart and Life. Now Je&s;us is truly glorified by the&s;e divine Effects appearing in his Members; whereby, the Under&s;tanding, which is naturally dark, is enlightened: The Will which is &s;tubborn and contrary to the Will of GOD, is bowed and brought into Subjection; and the Affections which are alienated from GOD and his Truths, are brought to love and e&s;teem Je&s;us, and the Way of Salvation by him.</P>
<P>Though to &s;ave Appearance of not <HI>totally</HI> denying the Work of the Spirit, Mr. <HI>Relly</HI> is plea&s;ed to tell us, <HI>p.</HI> 108, he <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"would not be un|der&s;tood of &s;peaking lightly of the Spirit of Truth, or of his Opera|tions upon the Heart of Man, according to the Scripture Account thereof, which is there undeniably made, to con&s;i&s;t in receiving the Things which are his (<HI>viz.</HI> Chri&s;t,) and in &s;hewing them to us; that Je&s;us alone might be glorified."</Q></P>
<P>But I would a&s;k, and appeal to Scripture, is this the only Work and Office of the Holy Spirit? Is there no Work wrought by his divine Energy in and upon the Heart of GOD's People? The Scrip|tures fully prove there is; and the People of GOD in every Age, have, from real Experience te&s;tified of it. For by Nature they are <HI>Children of Wrath, dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins: and Enemies in their Minds to GOD by wicked Works.</HI> Therefore a Change both of State and Practice is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to eternal Glory: Nor could they be meet to par|take of it, unle&s;s the Holy Spirit effected this; which he doth accor|ding to the Word of Truth, by quickening and regenerating their Souls; they are made to partake of a <HI>new Birth,</HI> into a new State and

By the Holy Gho&s;t they are enlightened, convinced of Sin; Faith is wrought in their Hearts by his Power; <HI>Repentance unto Salvation is granted</HI> unto them; they are &s;anctified, and led by the Spirit; and through the Spirit are enabled to mortify the Deeds of the Body, <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 13. GOD's <HI>Spirit bears Witne&s;s with their Spirits, that they are the Children of GOD,</HI> chap. viii. 16. <HI>And &s;eals them unto the Day of eternal Redemption,</HI> Eph. iv. 30. Thus doth the Scripture of Truth te&s;tify of the Work of the Spirit, on the Hearts of the Members of Je&s;us, producing the&s;e holy and happy Effects. But in direct Oppo&s;ition to all this, Hear Mr. <HI>Relly</HI>'s Declaration, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the Spirit of Error pretends to &s;hew Mankind other Excellencies than what are found in Je&s;us. Such as Reforma|tion, Changes, pious Motions and De&s;ires in them&s;elves.&mdash;Antr|chri&s;t, or the fal&s;e Chri&s;t, &s;eeks not the Glory of Je&s;us, but &s;peaks of him&s;elf, of its own Operations; of Joys; Sorrows, Hatred to Evil, langui&s;hing after Goodne&s;s by him wrought in the Heart,"</Q> <HI>&amp;c.&mdash;</HI><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This is that Spirit which I have &s;et my Face again&s;t, and of which I &s;peak where ever I have through my Book ranked this Phra&s;e, <HI>the Work of the Spirit on the Hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> among the cant Terms, of <HI>Judai&s;m</HI> blended with <HI>Heatheni&s;m.</HI></Q></P>
<P>After the Recital of this, it mu&s;t be granted, where the Con&s;cience <HI>is hardned through the Deceitfulne&s;s of Sin; and &s;eared as with an hot Iron,</HI> again&s;t all Sen&s;e of Sin; Per&s;ons in &s;uch a State, are quite free from any Sen&s;e of <HI>Sorrow, Hatred of Evil, langui&s;hing after Goodne&s;s, Reformation, Changes, pious Motions and De&s;ires in them&s;elves,</HI> &amp;c.

Is it not con&s;i&s;tent, perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the Purity of the Doctrine and Genius of the Go&s;pel, and flows from the Work of the Spirit of Truth on the Heart? And as to Joys, if there be any Con&s;o|lation, it is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and flows from him as the Head, to the Hearts of his Members, through the Power of the Holy Spirit: Hence a Fruit of the Spirit is called <HI>Joy;</HI> and <HI>Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> Rom. xiv. 17. is of the E&s;&s;ence of the Kingdom of Je&s;us; and it is an apo&s;tolia

Thus St. <HI>Paul</HI> writes to Believers, <HI>We be&s;eech you Brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Je&s;us, that as you have recei|ved of us, how you ought to walk and to</HI> PLEASE <HI>GOD, &s;o you would</HI> ABOUND <HI>more and more,</HI> 1 The&s;. iv. 1. And the beloved Di&s;ciple, <HI>John</HI> iii. 22. te&s;tifies, <HI>we keep his Commandments, and do tho&s;e Things which are</HI> plea&s;ing <HI>in his Sight.</HI> Thus doth it appear that Je&s;us is Sanctification to his Members. Being united to him, they derive Sanctification from him, inwardly in their Souls, which &s;hews it&s;elf out|wardly in a holy Walk. And indeed the very End of Believers being dead to the Law, to all Hopes and Expectations of obtaining Salvation for the Sake of their own Works is, that being influenced by evangeli|cal Principles, Faith and Love, they might <HI>live unto GOD.</HI> Hence, &s;aith he, <HI>Sin &s;hall not have the Dominion over you,</HI> (that believe) <HI>becau&s;e ye are not under the Law, but under Grace,</HI> Rom. vi. 14. Not under Fears of Wrath and Hell, but under a Sen&s;e of Love and Salvation. And what Inference doth the Apo&s;tle draw from hence? Doth he join with the licentious and horrid A&s;&s;ertion &s;o much u&s;ed by &s;ome in this our Day, <Q REND="inline">"The more Sin you commit, the more Glory you bring to the Merits of Chri&s;t"</Q>?

<P>Thus, in every Point of View, we &s;ee the Doctrines of Grace are <HI>according to Godline&s;s,</HI> they have no Tendency to Libertini&s;m and Li|centiou&s;ne&s;s: Neither di&s;courage the Performance of good Works, nor encourage in Sin, but lead to Holine&s;s in all Manner of Conver&s;ation, and to tho&s;e Things which are &s;piritually good, well-plea&s;ing and acceptable with GOD. It is true, there were from the Beginning
<PB N="26" REF="25">
tho&s;e, who <HI>wre&s;ted the Scripture to their own De&s;truction;</HI> perverted the Truths of GOD; <HI>ungodly Mex, who turned the Grace of GOD, i. e.</HI> (the Doctrines of the Go&s;pel of the Grace of GOD) <HI>into La&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> So it is in this our Day. Is not the Author of UNION, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> acting thus? Do not his Writings fully prove it? For, according to Mr. <HI>Relly</HI>'s Doctrine, neither the Law nor the Go&s;pel, the Fear nor the Love of GOD, ever produce any Effect or Influence in the Life and Conver&s;ation of Chri&s;tians, of a good, holy or righteous Nature. Nay, &s;o far is he from teaching or exhorting Men to this, that he is at the Pains (according to his u&s;ual and very ingenuous Method) to mangle a Text, to di&s;courage and reprove, what he deems, &s;uch unchri&s;tian Practice.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ays this Author, <HI>p.</HI> 126. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Our Saviour reproved the Church of <HI>Laodicea</HI> in the &s;harpe&s;t Manner, for growing rich and increa&s;ing in Goods,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Here is another glaring In&s;tance of this Writer's handling the Word of GOD deceitfully. It is not &s;ufficient with him to deny and oppo&s;e the plain Truths of GOD, but he al&s;o takes the Liberty to mutilate the Sen&s;e and alter the Meaning thereof. For, there is no &s;uch Reproof to be found in all the Book of GOD. On the Contrary, St. <HI>Paul</HI> exhorts Believers, <HI>to do Good and be rich in good Works,</HI> 1 Tim. vi. 18. The plain Truth here is, our Saviour's Re|prehen&s;ion of the Church was, <HI>becau&s;e thou &s;aye&s;t I am rich,</HI> &amp;c. (which Words, this Author has omitted, for what Rea&s;on he is be&s;t able to &s;ay, but we have the Liberty to judge) when this was not the Ca&s;e. She fancied her State to be, what in reality it was not, as the Text, <HI>Rev.</HI> iii. 17. fully &s;hews. Therefore our Saviour, &s;o far from re|proving the Church of <HI>Laodicea</HI> for being rich and increa&s;ed in Goods, in a &s;piritual Sen&s;e, that he gives her Advice in the next Ver&s;e how &s;he might become &s;o. <HI>I coun&s;el th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e to buy of me Gold tried in the Fire, that thou maye&s;t be rich,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now what a &s;hocking Perver&s;ion of our Lord's Meaning is here!

<P>Thus doth this Author by &s;uch gro&s;s Ab&s;urdity, confound the Per|&s;ons of Je&s;us and the Sinner; the Redeemer and the Redeemed: So as to pervert and de&s;troy the plain Sen&s;e and Meaning of Scripture.

and &s;erves to no other U&s;e and Purpo&s;e, but to &s;ubvert the Chri&s;tian Doctrine, render the Word of GOD of none Effect, and to e&s;tabli&s;h a Set of Notions in the Minds of Mankind, which are diametrically oppo&s;ite to the Word of GOD, de&s;tructive of the Faith and Practice of Chri&s;tianity, and tend to &s;teel Men's Minds again&s;t Conviction, and &s;ear the Con&s;ciences, while they abound in open Profanene&s;s, Sen&s;uality and Ungodline&s;s.

are all the Exhortations, Cautions, Coun&s;els and Reproofs, which are directed to Believers from the Prophets and Apo&s;tles, yea, and from our Lord's own Mouth al&s;o, that the Members of Je&s;us might watch and pray, &s;trive again&s;t Sin, mortify their Lu&s;ts, &s;ubdue their Corruptions, and grow in Grace, and abound in the Fruits of Holine&s;s.
