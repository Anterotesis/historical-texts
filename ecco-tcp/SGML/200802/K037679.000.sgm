<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OUR connection and friend&s;hip, as well as the partiality I know you will enter|tain in favour of any attempt at regulated Drama, mark you as the per&s;on, to whom, with the mo&s;t propriety, and inclination, I can in&s;cribe the Comedy of the Heire&s;s.</P>
<P>It al&s;o comes to your Lord&s;hip's hand with a &s;econdary claim to your acceptance, as ow|ing its exi&s;tence to the lei&s;ure and tranquility I enjoyed during the two la&s;t &s;ummers at Know&s;ley.</P>
<P>I long intended, as your Lord&s;hip can wit|ne&s;s, to keep the name of the author con|cealed. After the &s;ucce&s;s with which the Play has been honoured, I mu&s;t expect that the change of my de&s;ign will be imputed by many to vanity: I &s;hall &s;ubmit, without murmuring, to that belief, if I may obtain equal credit for the &s;incerity of another pride

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE approbation the following Comedy has re|ceived upon the Stage, and the candour with which every critici&s;m, that has come to the Author's knowledge, has been accompanied, might encou|rage him to tru&s;t it to the clo&s;et without any other preface, than an acknowledgement of his gratitude to the Public, for the honours done to him. And if he detains the reader a few moments more, it is not to di&s;avow what has been hinted at in &s;ome of the daily prints, as a &s;pecies of plagiari&s;m, but to plead it in behalf of dramatic writing in general&punc; again&s;t rules, that if carried to the extent they lead to, would fix &s;hackles upon genius, and give a very undue limitation to variety.</P>
<P><HI>In point of fable for in&s;tance</HI>&mdash;Is it a reproach to borrow?</P>
<P>Surely the dramati&s;t, like the architect, brings his talents equally to the te&s;t, whether he builds upon another man's ground or his own. And if in&s;tead of &s;mall and detached parts, the writer of the Heire&s;s had taken the compleat plot of his play from a novel; he would have imitated the exam|ples (the only imitation to which he has any pre|tence) of the be&s;t dramatic Poets of every age.</P>
<P><HI>In point of originality of characters</HI>&mdash;It is humbly hoped this Comedy is not without it. But pre&s;ent in&s;tances apart, it is &s;ubmitted to the judicious, whether &s;uch an exaction of novelty as would make a re&s;emblance to any thing ever &s;een upon the &s;tage before unacceptable, might not materially vitiate the public ta&s;te, carry the major part of writers beyond the &s;cope of nature
<PB N="iv" REF="7" MS="y">
and probability, and deprive the &s;pectator of that plea&s;ing and infinite diver&s;ity of &s;hape and colour|ing that the leading pa&s;&s;ions, vices, and follies of civili&s;ed life, admit. Love, avarice, mi&s;anthropy, &amp;c. &amp;c. if drawn a thou&s;and and a thou&s;and times with new &s;hades, and in different points of view, will do as much credit to invention, and have as ju&s;t an effect in exhibition, as if Moliere or Con|grave had never touched the &s;ubjects. It is not whether there may not be per&s;onages in the Heire&s;s, in whom we may di&s;cover family features, that is a&s;ked, but whether they are not &s;till individuals, with whom we have been hitherto unacquainted&mdash; i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> a que&s;tion, not for the Author to determine.</P>
<P><HI>Original thought</HI>&mdash;It has been ob&s;erved that there is an image in a &s;peech of Lord Gayville, copied clo&s;ely from Rou&s;&s;eau. Very po&s;&s;ibly it may be &s;o. The Author of the Heire&s;s cer|tainly has read that elegant writer; and to &s;hew how ea&s;ily invention may be deceived, he will quote another writer (in his e&s;timation &s;till more elegant) who thus accounts, and apologizes for, uncon&s;cious plagiari&s;m&mdash;<Q>"Faded ideas," &s;ays Mr. Sheridan, "Float in the fancy like half for|gotten dreams; and imagination, in its fulle&s;t enjoyments, becomes &s;u&s;picious of its offspring, and doubts whether it has created or adopted."</Q></P>
<P>More &s;entiments and expre&s;&s;ion due to the ima|gination of others, may po&s;&s;ibly be challenged, though they are equally out of the recollection of the Author.&mdash;He would only wi&s;h the candid to admit the probability, that while he believed them his own, he thought them his be&s;t.</P>
<P>Many of the &s;cenes now &s;ubmitted to peru&s;al, have been &s;hortened in repre&s;entation, and a few
<PB N="v" REF="8">
words have been altered occa&s;ionally to pre&s;erve connection&mdash;a circum&s;tance nece&s;&s;ary to be known le&s;t the performers &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected of negli|gence, when, on the contrary, too much cannot be &s;aid of their attention and zeal. When all have been eminent, it would be unnece&s;&s;ary, if not in|vidious, to particularize any: There is neverthele&s;s a Lady, to whom, by her &s;tanding &s;eparately and individually in one part of the performance, the Author, without departing from his maxim, may expre&s;s his more than ordinary obligation. Mi&s;s Farren, by her inimitable manner of deliver|ing the Epilogue, has made a better apology to the public than any his pen could have produced, for a compo&s;ition which, from an accident, was much too ha&s;tily written in &s;ome parts, and in others pieced together with a like in&s;ufficiency of time.</P>
<P>The Epilogue excepted, no defects in the fol|lowing &s;heets can be covered by the excu&s;e of hurry: They cannot be &s;o, con&s;i&s;tently with truth, nor indeed, with inclination: For the Author had rather be thought incapable of plea&s;ing, after his greate&s;t cares, than wanting in the attention and re&s;pect which every man who ventures to publi&s;h a production of this nature owes to the world and to him&s;elf&mdash;Not to let it pa&s;s from his hands with|out frequent revi&s;al, and the be&s;t con&s;idered fini&s;h his abilities can give.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE. By the Rt. Hon. RICHARD FITZPATRICK. Spoken by Mr. KING.</HEAD>
<L>AS &s;prightly &s;unbeams gild the face of day,</L>
<L>When low'ring tempe&s;ts calmly glide away,</L>
<L>So when the Poet's dark horizon clears,</L>
<L>Array'd in &s;miles, the Epilogue appears.</L>
<L>She, of that hou&s;e the lively emblem &s;till,</L>
<L>Who&s;e brilliant &s;peakers &s;tart what themes they will,</L>
<L>Still varying topicks for her &s;portive rhymes</L>
<L>From all the follies of the&s;e <HI>fruitful</HI> times,</L>
<L>Uncheck'd by forms, with flippant hand may cull,</L>
<L>Prologues, <HI>like Peers,</HI> by privilege are dull.</L>
<L>In &s;olemn &s;train addre&s;s th' a&s;&s;embled Pit,</L>
<L>The legal judges of dramatic wit,</L>
<L>Confining &s;till with dignified decorum,</L>
<L>Their ob&s;ervations,&mdash;to the Play before 'em.</L>
<L>Now when each batchelor a helpmate lacks,</L>
<L>(That &s;weet exemption from a double Tax)</L>
<L>When laws are fram'd with a benignant plan</L>
<L>Of light'ning <HI>burdens</HI> on the married man,</L>
<L>And Hymen adds one &s;olid comfort more</L>
<L>To all tho&s;e <HI>comforts</HI> he conferr'd before,</L>
<L>To &s;mooth the rough laborious road to fame</L>
<L>Our bard has cho&s;en&mdash;an <HI>alluring name.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="vii" REF="10">As wealth in wedlock oft is known to hide</L>
<L>The imperfections of a homely bride,</L>
<L>This tempting title, he perhaps expects,</L>
<L>May heighten beauties,&mdash;and conceal defects:</L>
<L>Thus &s;ixty's wrinkles, view'd thro' fortune's gla&s;s,</L>
<L>The ro&s;y dimples of &s;ixteen &s;urpa&s;s:</L>
<L>The modern &s;uitor, gra&s;ps his fair one's hand,</L>
<L>O'erlooks her per&s;on, and adores&mdash;<HI>her land</HI>;</L>
<L><HI>Leers</HI> on her hou&s;es with an <HI>ogling eye,</HI></L>

<L>His <HI>heartfelt</HI> pangs thro' groves of&mdash;<HI>timber</HI> vents,</L>
<L>And runs di&s;tracted for&mdash;<HI>her three per cents.</HI></L>
<L>Will thus the Poet's mimic Heire&s;s find,</L>
<L>The bridegroom critic to <HI>her</HI> failings blind,</L>
<L>Who claims, alas! his nicer ta&s;te to hit,</L>
<L>The Lady's portion paid in <HI>&s;terling</HI> wit?</L>
<L>On your decrees, to fix her future fate,</L>

<P>YOUR knowledge in the profe&s;&s;ion, Mr. Right|ly, is as que&s;tionle&s;s as your integrity; but there is &s;omething &s;o &s;urprizing in the di&s;covery of the Charlton e&s;tate.</P>

<P>It is &s;o &s;trange, that I will not pro|nounce a po&s;itive opinion, till I have read again the collateral papers, and con&s;ider'd fully the de|&s;cents in your family. Your grandfather, I think, was deceived in &s;uppo&s;ing he had a right to &s;ell that part of the Charlton e&s;tate, which Al&s;crip propo&s;es for his daughter's portion. The &s;trength of this old &s;ettlement mu&s;t have e&s;caped my brother lawyer, or he was mad when he put it into my hands.</P>

<P>She has the faults that wealth and a fal&s;e education create, but they are not incurable. Marry her your&s;elf. By &s;inking the claim in the union with his family, you command the father's approbation; and the daughter mu&s;t be of a &s;trange mould indeed, if the &s;ame obligation does not become a corrective of her pride, and an excitement to her gratitude. <STAGE>&s;miling</STAGE> I give &s;ome token of my friend&s;hip, when, as a lawyer, I propo&s;e you a wife in&s;tead of a &s;uit in chan|cery.</P>

<L>Then for our Heire&s;s&mdash;forced from finer air,</L>
<L>That lately fan'd her plumes in Berkeley-&s;quare;</L>
<L>Will &s;he be <HI>helple&s;s</HI> in her <HI>new</HI> re&s;ort,</L>
<L>And find no friends&mdash;about the inns of court?</L>
<L>Sages be candid&mdash;tho' you hate a knave,</L>
<L>Sure, for <HI>example,</HI> you'll a Rightly &s;ave.</L>
<L>Be kind for once ye <HI>clerks</HI>&mdash;ye &s;portive &s;irs</L>
<L>Who haunt our Theatres in boots and &s;purs,</L>
<L>So may you &s;afely pre&s;s your nightly hobby,</L>
<L>Run the whole ring&mdash;and <HI>end</HI> it in the lobby.</L>
<L>Lovers of <HI>truth,</HI> be kind; and own that <HI>here</HI></L>
<L><HI>That</HI> love is &s;train'd as far as it will bear.</L>
<L><HI>Poets</HI> may write&mdash;<HI>Philo&s;ophers</HI> may dream&mdash;</L>
<L>But would the <HI>world</HI> bear truth in the extreme?</L>
<L>What, not one Blandi&s;h left behind! not one!</L>
<L>Poets are mute, and Painters all undone:</L>
<L>Where are tho&s;e charms that Nature's term &s;urvive,</L>
<L>The maiden bloom that glows at <HI>forty-five?</HI></L>
<L>Truth takes the pencil&mdash;<HI>wrinkles&mdash;freckles&mdash;&s;quint,</HI></L>
<L>The whole's transform'd,&mdash;the devil's in't,</L>
<L><PB N="112" REF="115">Dimples turn &s;cars, the &s;mile becomes a &s;cowl!</L>
<L>The hair the ivy-bu&s;h, the face the owl.</L>
<L>But &s;hall an <HI>author</HI> mock the flatt'rer's pow'r?</L>
<L>Oh might you all be <HI>Blandi&s;hes</HI> this hour!</L>
<L>Then would the candid jurors of the Pit,</L>
<L>Grant their mild pa&s;&s;port to the realms of Wit;</L>
<L>Then would I mount the car where oft I ride,</L>
<L>And place the favour'd culprit by my &s;ide.</L>
<L>To aid our flight&mdash;one fa&s;hionable hint&mdash;</L>
<L>See my authority&mdash;a Morning Print&mdash;</L>
<L>"We learn"&mdash;ob&s;erve it Ladies&mdash;"France's Queen</L>
<L>"Loves, like our own, a heart-directed &s;cene;</L>
<L>"And while each thought &s;he weighs, each beauty &s;cans,</L>
<L>"Breaks, in one night's applau&s;e, a &s;core of fans!"</L>
<STAGE>Beating her fan again&s;t her hand.</STAGE>
<L>Adopt the mode, ye Belles&mdash;&s;o end my prattle,</L>
<L>And &s;hew how you'll outdo a Bourbon rattle.</L>
