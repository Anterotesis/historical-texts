<P>AS &s;oon as I had determined to lay before the public the en&s;uing Sketches, I could not he&s;itate in choo&s;|ing who&s;e name I &s;hould wi&s;h might honour the introduction of them into the world&mdash;To whom could a work of this nature, with &s;o much propri|ety be addre&s;&s;ed, as to him who had not only relinqui&s;hed, for a &s;eries of years, all the allurements that a po|li&s;hed nation could di&s;play to opu|lence and early age, but had expo&s;ed

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN the enlightened ages of Greece and Rome, and under the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing &s;tate of Arabian literature, Botany, as a &s;cience, had no exi&s;tence. Nor was it till &s;ome time after the revival of learning, that tho&s;e combinations and di&s;tinctions were effectually di&s;covered, which, in the end, by giving ri&s;e to &s;y&s;tem, have rai&s;ed the &s;tudy of plants, to that rank it holds at pre&s;ent in the &s;cale of knowledge.</P>
<P>If in the contemplation of flowers, man|kind at large, have in every age placed one of their pure&s;t plea&s;ures, how greatly mu&s;t the&s;e delights be enhanced to the enamoured votary of Botanical Knowledge! who, whil&s;t he &s;urveys that wonderfully varied elegance and beauty, which charm the eye of all, penetrates &s;till farther, and at the &s;ame in|&s;tant, di&s;cerns al&s;o, tho&s;e analogies and di&s;|criminations,
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
in the <HI>number, figure, &s;ituation,</HI> and <HI>proportion</HI> of parts, on which are laid the foundations of modern Botanical Science; a&s;&s;ociations and di&s;tinctions, which are veil|ed from the untaught eye of common ob|&s;ervation, how&s;oever &s;en&s;ible to the general beauties of Nature! And hence, indepen|dently of its real and ultimate utility, from the acce&s;&s;ion of knowledge it brings to the Materia Medica, and by its general a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the various arts and elegancies of life, the &s;tudy of the vegetable kingdom, has prov|ed, to numerous &s;peculative and inqui&s;itive minds, the &s;ource of much intellectual en|joyment.</P>
<P>This Science is, by many, con&s;idered as of &s;o ea&s;y attainment, that it is not unu&s;ual to a&s;&s;ign the name of Botani&s;t, to any man who&s;e memory enables him to repeat the nomenclature of perhaps a few hundred plants; how&s;oever uninformed he may be, of tho&s;e principles which entitle him, to the real name and character: With equal ju&s;|tice might any man who knows the names only of the parts of a complex machine, a&s;&s;ume to him&s;elf that fame which is due
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
&s;olely to the inventor of it. By this de|grading idea, men of the fir&s;t learning and talents in this branch of knowledge, have frequently been levelled with the mo&s;t &s;u|perficial enquirers, and the mo&s;t ignorant pretenders. Hence al&s;o this Science, which even in a &s;peculative view, holds no mean rank, and, con&s;idered practically, is clo&s;ely connected with medicine, and with the arts and elegancies of life, has been held forth as a trifling and futile employment. In truth, he properly is entitled, in any degree, to the character of the Botani&s;t, who&s;e ac|quirements enable him to inve&s;tigate, to de|&s;cribe, and &s;y&s;tematically arrange, any plant which comes under his cognizance. But to the&s;e abilities, in order to compleat the character, &s;hould be united, an acquaintance with the Philo&s;ophy of Vegetables, and with the Hi&s;tory of the Science, in all its &s;everal relations, both literary and practical, from remote antiquity to his own time: at|tainments which require a competent &s;hare of general learning, and no &s;mall degree of painful toil and patient indu&s;try, both in the fields and in the clo&s;et.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="9">
If this de&s;cription of the Botani&s;t be a true one, it manife&s;tly excludes a number of frivolous pretenders; the &s;cience it&s;elf ri&s;es in importance, and admits of great di|ver&s;ity of employment, to the ta&s;te, the ta|lents, and learning of tho&s;e who direct their attention to it. Whil&s;t then it is the pro|vince of &s;ome to inve&s;tigate new &s;ubjects, to a&s;certain tho&s;e imperfectly known, and to record the various improvements and di&s;|coveries of the day, let it be that of others, to do ju&s;tice to departed merit, to recall the &s;cattered remembrances of the lives, and hold out the example of tho&s;e who have labour|ed in the &s;ame field before them.</P>
<P>In tracing the progre&s;s of human know|ledge through its &s;everal gradations of im|provement, it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible for an in|qui&s;itive and liberal mind, of congenial ta&s;te, not to feel an ardent wi&s;h of information relating to tho&s;e per&s;ons by whom &s;uch im|provements have &s;everally been given: and hence ari&s;es that intere&s;ting &s;ympathy which almo&s;t in&s;eparably connects biography with the hi&s;tory of each re&s;pective branch of knowledge.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="10">
In this age, when &s;ucce&s;sful advance|ments in the &s;tudy of plants, have &s;o far extended its plea&s;ures, as to render Botany almo&s;t fa&s;hionable; and at a time, when Biographical writings find a reception here|tofore unknown; it became matter of &s;pe|culation, that no one &s;hould have delineated the <HI>Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of Botany in Britain,</HI> in connexion with the lives of tho&s;e who have contributed to amplify and embelli&s;h it.</P>
<P>Among the various enquiries which em|ploy the pens of the learned, none perhaps afford more general &s;atisfaction, than &s;uch as relate to the origin and progre&s;s of &s;cience and literature. But when the&s;e lead to ob|jects which we love and cheri&s;h, they come recommended by a charm that &s;ecures a welcome, and thus promi&s;e a more peculiar entertainment and gratification: however, di&s;qui&s;itions of this kind are of difficult ex|ecution, e&s;pecially when applied to &s;ubjects of a &s;cientific nature, as requiring the union of various talents in the writer&mdash;an appro|priate &s;hare of learning, an exten&s;ive literary as well as practical acquaintance with the &s;ubject, united to all tho&s;e qualifications re|qui&s;ite
<PB N="xii" REF="11">
in a biographer, &s;uch as diligence and accuracy in inve&s;tigating the di&s;coveries of his authors, and impartiality in characteriz|ing them, and in a&s;&s;igning to each his due degree of merit. To the&s;e per&s;onal requi&s;ites mu&s;t be added, the adventitious circum|&s;tances of a &s;ituation favourable to his re|&s;earches, not only from manu&s;cripts, and large libraries, but from actual intercour&s;e with the learned.</P>
<P>Fully &s;en&s;ible in this view of the little claim I have to the character and advan|tages here &s;poken of, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary, to avoid the cen&s;ure of temerity, that I &s;hould premi&s;e &s;ome account of the original occa&s;ion of this attempt.</P>
<P>The attention I had given to Engli&s;h Bo|tany in my younger days, had prompted me, at one time, to plan a <HI>Flora</HI> of the plants of this kingdom, on an exten&s;ive &s;cale; including, be&s;ides the medical and oecono|mical hi&s;tory of each, a <HI>Pinax,</HI> in which it was my de&s;ign to have di&s;tingui&s;hed, as far as I was able, the fir&s;t di&s;coverer of each &s;pecies, both among foreign writers and tho&s;e of our own kingdom; and to have
<PB N="xiii" REF="12">
arranged all their &s;ynonyms, at large, under each plant, in chronological order. To &s;uch a work the following <HI>&s;ketches,</HI> in a &s;omewhat more contracted form, were in|tended as an introduction. In the mean time, if more important avocations had not, the want of nece&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;i&s;tance from books, would probably have &s;topped the progre&s;s of a plan of &s;uch extent. Although this purpo&s;e was relinqui&s;hed, yet, as the mate|rials were collected, and this part of the de&s;ign was independent of the other, I flat|tered my&s;elf, that, having made &s;ome al|terations, and enlarged the whole, under &s;o total a want of any &s;imilar work, the&s;e anec|dotes might afford information to young Botani&s;ts, and po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome amu&s;ement to tho&s;e of more advanced knowledge in the &s;cience.</P>
<P>Although botanical writings are the prin|cipal objects of the&s;e pages, yet, as &s;everal of the&s;e authors were con&s;picuous for their various attainments in different branches of literature, their other pur&s;uits and publica|tions, where my re&s;ources have afforded opportunity, have occa&s;ionally been recited;
<PB N="xiv" REF="13">
and I have been more particularly &s;olicitous to collect into one view, under each author, tho&s;e various temporary and occa&s;ional pro|ductions, which, after the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Royal Society, were communicated to that body, and form a part of the <HI>Philo&s;o|phical Tran&s;actions.</HI></P>
<P>In con&s;idering the botanical writings, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the fir&s;t eminence, I have had recour&s;e, with few exceptions, to the books them&s;elves; but, confined to a pri|vate collection, have yet too frequently had occa&s;ion to regret the want of more exten|&s;ive a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and, although I have not formally quoted my authorities, on every occa&s;ion, they will be &s;ufficiently manife&s;t to all &s;uch as are conver&s;ant in botanical li|terature. In the hi&s;torical and biographical parts, the mo&s;t material and authentic facts, have likewi&s;e been derived from the re&s;pec|tive authors in botany: and, not unfrequent|ly, I have availed my&s;elf of &s;everal of the older periodical publications. Exclu&s;ively of the&s;e, be&s;ides collateral a&s;&s;i&s;tance received from &s;eparate works, and from various col|lections of &s;maller bulk, I more e&s;pecially

<P>In a work intended to exhibit the pro|gre&s;s of the &s;cience in <HI>England,</HI> and to a&s;|&s;ign to each writer his re&s;pective prai&s;e, I could have wi&s;hed to have &s;ubjoined a com|plete
<PB N="xvi" REF="15">
catalogue of all the Engli&s;h plants, with the names of the fir&s;t di&s;coverer an|nexed; or of that author in who&s;e work each fir&s;t occurs, as an Engli&s;h &s;pecies. The progre&s;s I had made in the intended Pinax above-mentioned, would have enabled me to have made this addition; but, as &s;uch a catalogue could have afforded gratification only to the more curious and critical bota|ni&s;ts, unle&s;s thrown into a form, by the addi|tion of other matter, which would have in|crea&s;ed the bulk of this work to another vo|lume, it was judged mo&s;t proper to omit it.</P>
<P>Con&s;cious of the many defects attending the&s;e <HI>&s;ketches,</HI> and fully &s;en&s;ible that they merit no higher appellation than what the title imports, it is with much deference, even under that idea, that I &s;ubmit them to the in&s;pection of the literary world; and, per|haps, the indulgence they require, is great|er than ought to be expected: but I am willing to hope, that they will find that reception from learned and candid judges, which &s;uch are wont to be&s;tow on a fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay, in any department of literature.</P>

<HEAD>PRIMAEVAL BOTANY.</HEAD>
<P>THE origin of Botany, con&s;idered in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive view, mu&s;t have been coeval with man. Before the inven|tion of arts, the di&s;covery of metals, and the u&s;e of implements and arms, by which animals were more immediately &s;ubjected
<PB N="2" REF="21">
to their power, it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed that the human race derived, from the vegetable creation, the chief part of their &s;u&s;tenance, and the primary conveniences of life.

The &s;ame faithful directors would in&s;en&s;ibly inform him of the various qualities, and the different effects of them on his body.

<P>This various knowledge would be handed down traditionally, from one generation to another, and with it, the names of &s;uch as were happily the fir&s;t di&s;coverers of new aliments, or medicinal properties, would

de&s;cend with increa&s;ing reverence, until, in|volved in ob&s;curity by length of time, &s;u|per&s;tition rai&s;ed them to the rank of gods. Thus, in the early ages of mankind, as now among the &s;till unlettered and uncultivated nations of the earth, the admini&s;tration of &s;imples, for the cure of wounds and di&s;ea&s;es, was almo&s;t ever accompanied with &s;uper|&s;titious ceremonies and incantations. Hence too, in proce&s;s of time, the character of the prie&s;t and the phy&s;ician was united; and the &s;ick re&s;orted to the temples of the gods for relief: and, although inve&s;tigation and rational &s;cience made &s;low progre&s;s, yet, in every nation, from the mo&s;t cultivated to the mo&s;t barbarous, the number of &s;imples u&s;ed for medicinal purpo&s;es, became by degrees very con&s;iderable. Thus, when at length, phy&s;ic a&s;&s;umed a more regular form, and was taught in the &s;chools of Greece, the writings of HIPPOCRATES enumerate three hundred vegetables u&s;ed in phy&s;ic. Four centuries afterwards they were augmented by DIOSCORIDES to near &s;even hundred; and to the&s;e the Arabians added no incon&s;iderable number of valuable

articles. There is room to believe, that the antient <HI>Gymno&s;ophi&s;ts</HI> of the Ea&s;t, pur|&s;ued the &s;tudy of plants, with a &s;ucce&s;s equal to that of the Greeks; and the mo|dern nations of the Ea&s;t, the Japone&s;e, the Chine&s;e, and the Brachmans of India, incon|te&s;tibly excel the enlightened nations of Greece and Rome, in their knowledge of Botany: witne&s;s the "Garden of Mala|bar," which comprehends near eight hun|dred plants; all which are de&s;cribed, and the virtues recorded, with an accuracy and preci&s;ion, unexampled in the antient au|thors of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome.</HI> But to approach nearer home: the Druids of <HI>Gaul,</HI> and of <HI>Britain,</HI> cultivated the knowledge of herbs, with no incon&s;iderable diligence. Whether the&s;e antient <HI>Magi</HI> of the We&s;t, who were both prie&s;ts and phy&s;icians, &s;prung from tho&s;e of the Ea&s;t, and thus derived their knowledge from a common &s;ource, a point which has hitherto divided the learned, or, whether their &s;cience was the re&s;ult of their own inve&s;tigation, I mu&s;t leave to the cri|tical antiquary to determine.</P>

<P>In the mean time, in tracing the origin and progre&s;s of botanical &s;cience in <HI>Britain,</HI> a &s;urvey of its &s;tate in the druidical times, ought to claim the fir&s;t attention; but in fact, the little information tran&s;mitted to us from the antients, relating to this extraordi|nary &s;ect, being almo&s;t wholly confined to <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Pliny,</HI> precludes any enlarged view re&s;pecting my particular object. It is from <HI>Pliny</HI> we learn, that to the <HI>mi&s;&s;eltoe,</HI> the <HI>vervain,</HI> the <HI>&s;elago,</HI> and the <HI>&s;amolus,</HI> the&s;e antient fathers of druidi&s;m attributed efficacies almo&s;t divine; and ordained the collection, and admini&s;tration of them, with rites and ceremonies, not &s;hort of re|ligious &s;trictne&s;s, and &s;uch as countenan|ced the gro&s;&s;e&s;t &s;uper&s;tition.</P>
<P>The <HI>mi&s;&s;eltoe,</HI> for in&s;tance, mu&s;t be cut only with a golden knife; mu&s;t be gather|ed when the moon was &s;ix days old; the prie&s;t cloathed in white; the plant received on a white napkin; and la&s;tly, two white bulls were to be &s;acrificed; and thus con|&s;ecrated,

<P>The <HI>mi&s;&s;eltoe</HI> perhaps, is, of the&s;e plants, the only one fully a&s;certained at this time. Its para&s;itical growth, the preference which the Druids gave to that which grew on the oak, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the de&s;criptions the antients have left of it, will &s;ufficiently ju&s;|tify the application to the <HI>vi&s;cum</HI> of the moderns. May I not add, that probably, amid&s;t the manifold virtues antiently a&s;|cribed to this plant, its power of curing the falling-&s;ickne&s;s, which has accompa|nied it almo&s;t to the pre&s;ent time, is the remnant of druidical u&s;e and tradition?</P>
<P>The <HI>vervain,</HI> after previous libations of honey, was to be gathered at the ri&s;ing of the dog-&s;tar; when neither &s;un nor moon &s;hone; with the left hand only; after de|&s;cribing a circle round the plant, &amp;c.; and thus prepared, it vanqui&s;hed fevers, and other di&s;tempers; was an antidote to the bite of &s;erpents, and a charm to conciliate friend&s;hip<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ib.</HI> lib. xxv. c. 9.</NOTE>.</P>

Short, and imperfect, as this view of Drui|dical Botany may be, as delivered to us by PLINY, yet there can be no doubt that the Britons, like all other rude nations, drew their medicinal &s;ources from the &s;im|ples growing around them, and were there|fore well acquainted with common plants.

<P>The la&s;t is &s;aid to be an Anglo-Saxon ver&s;ion of APULEIUS, whom I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to mention hereafter. The date of this tran&s;lation is of the tenth century. The Saxons having been converted to Chri&s;tianity at the latter end of the &s;ixth century, the communication between <HI>Bri|tain</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> became by degrees very fre|quent,
<PB N="15" REF="34">
and learning was then fir&s;t intro|duced into the&s;e realms.</P>
<P>The golden age, if I may be allowed that expre&s;&s;ion, of the Anglo-Saxon learn|ing, was the reign of ALFRED the Great. That munificent prince not only him&s;elf tran&s;lated Latin authors, but, as hi&s;torians in|form us, encouraged in every way, the tran&s;|fu&s;ion of all the knowledge of the times into the common language of the kingdom. To this aera, therefore, may rea&s;onably be refer|red the Saxon ver&s;ion of APULEIUS; who&s;e book &s;eems to have pre&s;erved popularity through all the middle ages, and was found in common u&s;e at the aera of printing.</P>
<P>As no publication of any <HI>Saxon</HI> herbal has ever taken place, we are unable to de|fine the extent of the knowledge of that time: at pre&s;ent, therefore, as in the in|&s;tance of antient <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Botany, we can only recur to the nomenclature of the in|digenous names, by which &s;ome of them are yet known; although many others have given way to Greek and Latin terms, and &s;ome to other revolutions, occa&s;ioned by the

<P>A li&s;t of the <HI>Anglo-Saxon</HI> names would be recoverable, in a great degree, by recur|ring to the old herbals, to SKINNER's Lexi|con, and other authorities of that kind. It would, I am per&s;uaded, be more exten&s;ive than a &s;uperficial view might &s;ugge&s;t, and would do credit to our Saxon ance&s;tors. I cannot help remarking, that many mi&s;|takes have probably ari&s;en from the neglect of our fir&s;t reformers of Botany in <HI>England,</HI> after they had formed &s;cientific names, in not pre&s;erving al&s;o the old and provincial terms; and that, on the whole, this ne|glect has retarded the progre&s;s of knowledge on this &s;ubject.</P>

<HEAD>MIDDLE AGES.</HEAD>
<P>LEARNING and &s;cience follow the fate of empires. On the decline of tho&s;e of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> and during that period in which the Saxons were e&s;tabli&s;h|ing them&s;elves in <HI>Britain,</HI> medical know|ledge pa&s;&s;ed into the hands of the trium|phant Saracens. <HI>Bagdat,</HI> under the Ea&s;tern Caliphs, became the &s;eat of learning. Much of the Greek phy&s;ic and philo&s;ophy was corruptly tran&s;lated by the command of Mu&s;&s;elmen; among whom at length it
<PB N="18" REF="37">
received due reception and encouragement. Schools were e&s;tabli&s;hed, in which ARIS|TOTLE, GALEN, DIOSCORIDES, and other writers, were &s;tudied; and their doctrines at length pervaded the whole dominion of the Saracens, and finally flouri&s;hed in the univer&s;ities of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>DIOSCORIDES, though in a corrupt and mutilated &s;tate, formed the ba&s;is of know|ledge in the <HI>Botany</HI> and Materia Medica of the Arabians. The &s;ituation of <HI>Bagdat,</HI> and its connection with <HI>India,</HI> allowed them &s;cope to introduce into phy&s;ic feveral u&s;e|ful &s;imples. Among others, we owe to the&s;e Orientals the milder purges of the pre&s;ent day; &s;uch as <HI>&s;enna, ca&s;&s;ia fi&s;tula, manna, tamarinds, rhubarb,</HI> and &s;everal drugs of other qualities, of which &s;ome retain a place in the pre&s;ent reformed &s;tate of the <HI>Materia Medica.</HI> AVICENNA, we are told, had coloured drawings for the in&s;truction of his pupils in Botany; and <HI>Pro&s;per</HI> AL|PINUS a&s;&s;ures us, he &s;aw at <HI>Cairo</HI> a volume of paintings of the plants of <HI>Aegypt, Ara|bia,</HI> and <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> which had been done for the u&s;e of a Sultan.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="38">
It is not ea&s;y, however, to judge, with preci&s;ion, of the extent of Arabian know|ledge on the &s;ubject of our work; &s;ince, probably, the be&s;t book of the Arabian &s;chool has yet remained unpubli&s;hed, that of <HI>Ebn</HI> BEITHAR. It is extant in the Pa|ri&s;ian, the E&s;curial, and other libraries. This learned Arab was particularly attached to the botanical branch of phy&s;ic. He was born in <HI>Spain;</HI> and after vi&s;iting <HI>Africa,</HI> travelled into the Levant, <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and even as far as the Indies, to improve his know|ledge.

<P>HERBELOT informs us, that from the &s;uperiority of his learning in this branch, he was &s;tyled <HI>A&s;chard,</HI> or The Botani&s;t. He wrote "A General Hi&s;tory of Simples, or of Plants, ranged in alphabetical order;" in which he gives the Greek, Arabic, and vernacular names; with the de&s;criptions of each; and particularly, in a more detailed manner, tho&s;e not de&s;cribed by DIOSCORI|DES and PLINY.</P>
<P>There is, notwith&s;tanding, but little room to believe, that more original knowledge
<PB N="20" REF="39">
could be derived from the Arabian monu|ments of &s;cience in this, than in the other departments of phy&s;ic. In their be&s;t au|thors, even the Greek names of plants are &s;o gro&s;sly perverted, that they are &s;carcely to be known.</P>
<P>The Grecian authors having been inac|curately tran&s;lated at fir&s;t, and the language neglected afterwards, phy&s;ic lo&s;t much un|der the dominion of the Arabians. It was, in the end, a corrupt Galenic theory, with an admixture of <HI>a&s;trology</HI> and &s;uper&s;tition. In this &s;tate the learned of Europe found it, in the celebrated Moori&s;h univer&s;ities of <HI>Spain.</HI> In the we&s;tern parts of Chri&s;ten|dom, e&s;pecially after the lap&s;e of the Latin tongue in <HI>Italy,</HI> it was &s;carcely le&s;s ob&s;cured by the ignorance of the Monks, by whom, almo&s;t &s;olely, the practice of it was en|gro&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Even the fir&s;t univer&s;ity in Chri&s;tendom, the renowned &s;chool of <HI>Salernum,</HI> founded by <HI>Charlemagne</HI> in the beginning of the ninth century, received its dictates from the cor|rupt &s;ources of the Arabians; who&s;e works are &s;aid to have been at length tran&s;lated

The famous precepts <HI>de Con&s;ervanda Valetudine,</HI> i&s;&s;ued from that &s;chool for the u&s;e of <HI>Ro|bert</HI> duke of Normandy, were, without doubt, well known in England, and proba|bly excited attention to the &s;tudy of Vege|tables; concerning which, numerous rules and cautions occur in that remnant of the learning of tho&s;e days.</P>
<P>During all the&s;e ages, the original &s;ources in the Greek authors were almo&s;t wholly forgotten, and the productions of that long night of &s;cience were equally rare and un|improving.</P>

This li&s;t, perhaps already too long, might have been con&s;iderably extended, but that it would have unnece&s;&s;arily &s;welled this article. As none of the&s;e manu&s;cripts, however, have been publi&s;hed, the exact &s;tate and progre&s;s of the &s;cience cannot be a&s;certained; yet enough is &s;een to convince us, that, although its advancemnet was &s;low and incon&s;iderable, it was not wholly lo&s;t in the darkne&s;s of that night, which, for &s;o many ages, ob&s;cured the &s;ources of knowledge. It is highly probable, that
<PB N="28" REF="47">
very few of the manu&s;cripts before enume|rated, exhibit any con&s;iderable portion of original matter; but, that they are princi|pally extracts and compilations, from pre|ceding writers of the lower age; &s;uch as, <HI>Apuleius, Aemilius Macer, S. Sethus, I&s;i|dore, Con&s;tantinus,</HI> the <HI>Pandects</HI> of <HI>Mat|thew Sylvaticus, Platearius,</HI> &s;ome of the later Arabians, and other writers of that &s;tamp. At the renovation of knowledge ju&s;t mentioned, the&s;e appear to have been the primary &s;ources from which our an|ce&s;tors of that generation derived a&s;&s;i&s;tance; &s;ince we find many MSS. of the above au|thors
<PB N="29" REF="48">
were in being, at the origin of print|ing, and were early i&s;&s;ued from the pre&s;s as the manuals of that day, in various parts of Chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved, that the la&s;t-men|tioned Saxon manu&s;cript, was a tran&s;lation of <HI>Lucius</HI> APULEIUS <HI>Madauren&s;is;</HI> who&s;e work, from &s;everal other circum&s;tances, there is room to believe, was, at that time, more diffu&s;ed and popular in <HI>England,</HI> than any other. This author, who lived in the age of the <HI>Antonines,</HI> was born at <HI>Madura</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> at that time a &s;eat of learning. He afterwards &s;tudied at <HI>Car|thage,</HI> and at <HI>Athens,</HI> and for &s;ome time ap|plied him&s;elf at <HI>Rome</HI> to juri&s;prudence, but at length quitted it, and devoted him&s;elf wholly to philo&s;ophy and phy&s;ic. He is well known as the author of the <HI>Mile&s;ian</HI> Fables, and other works of learning. His book <HI>De Herbis, &s;ive de Nominibus ac Virtutibus Herbarum,</HI> alone comes under our cognizance: In this he recites the names of medicinal herbs, in the Greek, Latin, Egyptian, Punic, Celtic, and Da|cian, and of &s;ome in the oriental languages.
<PB N="30" REF="49">
The&s;e names form the bulk of the book, which con&s;i&s;ts of one hundred and thirty chapters. After each name follows a &s;hort de&s;cription of the plant, the place of growth, and the properties. Then the di&s;|ca&s;es to which each &s;imple is applicable. The work neverthele&s;s abounds with gro&s;s errors in the names of plants, and inculcates the mo&s;t ab&s;urd ceremonies and &s;uper&s;ti|tions in the admini&s;tration of remedies; yet it was in much e&s;teem throughout the dark ages of literature.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not however be concealed, that &s;ome of the learned have judged, that this work, at lea&s;t as it now appears, was not written by the author who&s;e name it bears, but at a much later period. JOHNSON, the editor of <HI>Gerard,</HI> imagined it to be a tran&s;|lation of a Greek writer of the eighth cen|tury; but his conjecture is not thought probable by <HI>Fabricius</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">b. Latin. ab Erne&s;to.</HI> Lip&s;. 1774, tom. 3. p. 44.</NOTE>.

<P><PB N="31" REF="50">
I will give one in&s;tance from APULEIUS, of that credulity and &s;uper&s;tition, which, &s;anctioned by antiquity, yet prevailed in the admini&s;tration of remedies; and exhibits a melancholy proof of the wretched &s;tate of phy&s;ic, which, through &s;o many ages, had not broke the &s;hackles of druidical magic and impo&s;ition. As a cure for a di&s;ea&s;e, called by the French <HI>Nou&egrave; l'Equillette,</HI> you are directed to take &s;even &s;talks of the herb <HI>lions-foot,</HI> &s;eparated from the roots; the&s;e are to be boiled in water in the wane of the moon. The patient is to be wa&s;hed with this water, on the approach of night, &s;tand|ing before the thre&s;hold, on the out&s;ide of his own hou&s;e, and the per&s;on who per|forms this office for the &s;ick, is al&s;o not to fail to wa&s;h him&s;elf. This done, the &s;ick per&s;on is to be fumigated with the &s;moke of the herb <HI>Ari&s;tolochia,</HI> and both per&s;ons are then to enter into the hou&s;e together, taking &s;trict care not to look behind them while returning; after which, adds the au|thor, the &s;ick will immediately become well.</P>

<HEAD>MIDDLE AGES.</HEAD>
<P>AT this time manu&s;cripts of THEO|PHRASTUS, DIOSCORIDES, and PLINY, were not only exceedingly rare throughout Europe, but tho&s;e of the two former were unnoticed through ignorance of the Greek language; otherwi&s;e we can|not &s;uppo&s;e our ance&s;tors could have ne|glected them, for the crude and barbarous works which have been mentioned. It was not till the opening of the fifteenth cen|tury, that opportunity was given to recur to the&s;e repo&s;itories of antient lore. The flight of the Greeks into <HI>Italy,</HI> at the &s;ubver&s;ion of the Ea&s;tern Empire, and the &s;ub&s;equent
<PB N="35" REF="54">
invention of printing, by bringing to light, and di&s;&s;eminating the purer remains of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> at length broke the chains of barbari&s;m and &s;uper&s;tition, which, during &s;o many ages, had tyrannized over the under&s;tandings of mankind.</P>
<P>On this happy revolution, Botany, with other &s;ciences, revived, and pre&s;ently re|&s;umed another appearance. The publica|tion of the <HI>Patres Botanici</HI> rai&s;ed, at once, a &s;pirit of emulation to inve&s;tigate the &s;ub|jects of their works.</P>
<P>PLINY was fir&s;t printed, if not at <HI>Verona,</HI> in 1468, as is affirmed by &s;ome, and doubt|ed by others, at lea&s;t in the &s;ucceeding year, at <HI>Venice;</HI> and the avidity with which it was received, is manife&s;ted by the numerous im|pre&s;&s;ions of it, before the end of that cen|tury.</P>
<P>DIOSCORIDES came forth fir&s;t at <HI>Cologn,</HI> in a Latin tran&s;lation, in 1478; and in the original, by <HI>Aldus,</HI> in 1495. It was after|wards publi&s;hed in Latin by HERMOLAUS BARBARUS and RUELLIUS, in the year 1516; by VERGILIUS, in 1518; and by CORNARUS in 1529. The learned now
<PB N="36" REF="55">
prefer the edition with a tran&s;lation by SA|RACENUS, printed at <HI>Lyons</HI> in 1598.</P>
<P>THEOPHRASTUS was fir&s;t printed in Greek at <HI>Venice,</HI> without date, and by <HI>Al|dus,</HI> in 1495 and 1498. He was tran&s;lated into Latin by GAZA in 1483, and this ver|&s;ion has been preferred by &s;ucceeding wri|ters.</P>
<P>The re&s;toration of the&s;e &s;ages of anti|quity, immediately rai&s;ed up a numerous &s;et of commentators. Every plant was &s;ought for, and every plant was di&s;covered, in the works of antiquity. No drug u&s;ed in medicine was e&s;teemed <HI>true,</HI> unle&s;s found in DIOSCORIDES. <HI>Scaliger</HI> wrote animad|ver&s;ions on THEOPHRASTUS in 1566; in which he has corrected the ver&s;ion of <HI>Gaza</HI> in many places. Robert <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> produ|ced the parallel places in PLINY; and BO|DAEUS &agrave; STAPEL, in 1644, a&s;toni&s;hed the world, by a di&s;play of erudition on this au|thor, in which he exhau&s;ted all farther di&s;|qui&s;ition, by the profu&s;ion of his remarks, and collations, from all preceding writers.</P>
<P>The commentaries on DIOSCORIDES have been more numerous. The <HI>Corollaria</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="56">
of HERMOLAUS BARBARUS was publi&s;hed in 1492. To <HI>Hermolaus</HI> &s;ucceeded BRUNS|FELSIUS, <HI>Petrus Leyden&s;is,</HI> LACUNA, AMA|TUS LUSITANUS, <HI>Robert</HI> CONSTANTINE, <HI>Val.</HI> CORDUS, and &s;everal others; and finally MATTHIOLUS, who&s;e work has &s;u|per&s;eded the re&s;t. It was fir&s;t printed in 1554, and pa&s;&s;ed through &s;eventeen edi|tions. If we may believe one of the corre|&s;pondents of this author, thirty-two thou|&s;and copies had been &s;old before the year 1561<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MATTHIOL. <HI>Oper.

His <HI>Ca&s;tigationes Plinianae,</HI> were publi&s;hed in 1492, in which he &s;ucce&s;sfully corrected the text; and LEONICENUS, in the &s;ame year, was the fir&s;t who employed critical knowledge on this author. The corrup|tions of the text afforded great &s;cope after|wards to GALENIUS, RHENANUS, PIN|TIANI,
<PB N="38" REF="57">
and others. The <HI>Exercitationes Plinianae</HI> of SALMASIUS, are well known. Tho&s;e of the laborious and paradoxical HARDUIN, are the principal re&s;ort of mo|dern times.</P>
<P>It is a mortifying reflexion in the annals of human knowledge, that the bulk of the&s;e learned men, after their immen&s;e labours, mi&s;took, in numberle&s;s in&s;tances, the road to truth, and did but perplex the &s;cience they wi&s;hed to enlighten. The de&s;criptions of plants in the antient authors, were, at be&s;t, &s;hort, vague, and in&s;ufficient; and with this inconvenience, the &s;tudy of nature her&s;elf was neglected. In the mean time, there aro&s;e a genuine &s;et of cultivators, who, di&s;covering this error of the commen|tators, &s;tudied plants in the fields, where alone the be&s;t comments could be made. As the foremo&s;t of the&s;e, &s;tands BRUNS|FELSIUS. He was followed by TRAGUS, FUCHSIUS, <HI>Val.</HI> CORDUS, GESNER, CAE|SALPINUS, and above all CLUSIUS, to whom mu&s;t be added our own countryman TURNER. Still, even among the&s;e genuine re&s;torers of natural knowledge, many did
<PB N="39" REF="58">
not &s;ufficiently recollect, that all the plants of DIOSCORIDES, were not tho&s;e of <HI>Europe,</HI> but principally tho&s;e of <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> whil&s;t, in|&s;tead of traver&s;ing the fields of <HI>Greece, Cili|cia,</HI> and the Ea&s;t, they were &s;training all the de&s;criptions of this author, to accommo|date them to the vegetables of <HI>Europe.</HI> It is not &s;trange that their endeavours were but little &s;ucce&s;sful. Even, after the la|bours of RAUWOLF, who traver&s;ed <HI>Syria, Me&s;opotomia, Pale&s;tine,</HI> and <HI>Aegypt,</HI> in the &s;ixteenth century, and tho&s;e of the enlight|ened TOURNEFORT in the pre&s;ent, it does not appear, that of the &s;even hundred plants in the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> of DIOSCORIDES, more than four hundred, at the farthe&s;t, are properly a&s;certained at this time.</P>
<P>We learn from PLINY (lib. 25. c. 2.) that there were paintings of plants in his day; but he complains, that, through the inaccuracy of copiers, they were not to be depended on. SALMASIUS tells us, he in&s;pected a Greek MS. of DIOSCORIDES more than a thou&s;and years old, in which the plants were figured with &s;ufficient ele|gance indeed, but with little regard to truth
<PB N="40" REF="59">
and exact re&s;emblance. There are now exi&s;ting &s;everal manu&s;cripts of DIOSCO|RIDES, with illuminated figures, particu|larly the famous one in the imperial library at <HI>Vienna,</HI> of which LAMBECIUS treats largely.</P>
<P>It was procured by <HI>Bu&s;bequius,</HI> the em|peror's re&s;ident at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> about 1560; and is &s;aid to have been copied at the expence of JULIANA ANICIA, daugh|ter to the emperor <HI>Flavius Anicius Olyber,</HI> about the year 492. It has been regretted by &s;ome of the learned, that this MS. had not been brought earlier into <HI>Europe;</HI> by which means the commentators might have been &s;aved much trouble. Antient, how|ever, and &s;plendid as this is, it may ju&s;tly be doubted, whether the publication of it would have much conduced to the re&s;tora|tion of ancient Botany, and <HI>Materia Medica;</HI> &s;ince, if we are allowed to judge of the figures, from the &s;pecimens copied by DO|DONAEUS, nothing can exceed the rudene&s;s of them, or more &s;trongly ju&s;tify the re|mark of <HI>Salma&s;ius.</HI> And as &s;everal of the&s;e are copied into GERARD's Herbal, for the

<P>I &s;hall be thought, perhaps, in the fore|going pages, to have digre&s;&s;ed too much.

At this di&s;tance of time, perhaps it may require &s;ome warmth of imagination, to picture to the mind that &s;atisfaction, which ingenuous and learned men mu&s;t have ex|perienced, who lived when the veil was re|moved, which for ages had ob&s;cured and confined tho&s;e elegant &s;ources of intellec|tual enjoyments, which the writings of the antients di&s;play; when the means of attain|ing them were, by the invention of print|ing, &s;o happily amplified, and the progre&s;s, not only of tho&s;e arts and &s;ciences which embelli&s;h, but of tho&s;e which al&s;o dignify human nature by their utility, was no longer retarded.</P>

<HEAD>HORTUS SANITATIS.</HEAD>
<P>IT was not till &s;everal years after the aera of printing, that any original work, &s;trictly botanical, made its appearance, even on the continent; and &s;till longer before <HI>England</HI> produced any publication of im|portance in that way.</P>
<P>Previous to the fir&s;t dawning of this &s;ci|ence in <HI>England,</HI> it is almo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to mention &s;ome of the productions abroad, as they were the ba&s;is of what was here fir&s;t publi&s;hed, although, in fact, there was no original work before the <HI>Herbal</HI> of TUR|NER.</P>
<P>In the opinion of SEGUIER, the fir&s;t book on plants, with figures, was printed
<PB N="45" REF="64">
at <HI>Aug&s;burgh,</HI> &s;oon after the invention of wooden cuts, or tables, between the years 1475 and 1478, in the German tongue, with the title of "<HI>The Book of Nature.</HI>" It treats of animals and plants; of the lat|ter, a hundred and &s;eventy-&s;ix kinds are no|ticed, and many of them figured. The work is made up chiefly from PLINY, <HI>I&s;idore,</HI> and <HI>Platearius.</HI></P>
<P>This book &s;eems to have been &s;oon &s;u|per&s;eded by the famous Herbal of <HI>Mentz,</HI> in 1484, &s;tiled &s;imply "HERBARIUS;" which gave ri&s;e, the next year, to the well-known work ORTUS SANITATIS, a&s;cribed to CUBA, a phy&s;ician of <HI>Aug&s;burgh,</HI> and after|wards of <HI>Frankfort;</HI> who, if not the author, was at lea&s;t the editor of an enlarged and improved edition. This work, under dif|ferent editors, was the ba&s;is of all the <HI>Her|bals</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> for many years.</P>
<P>Its object is the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> from all nature; but vegetables occupy the greater part. The fir&s;t edition was compri&s;ed in four hundred and thirty-five chapters: in one, printed at Venice in 1511, which is in the black letter, they are extended to a

At the head of each chapter &s;tands a cut, than which, &s;carcely any thing can be conceived more rude; and, in &s;ome ca&s;es, nothing is more puerile or ridiculous. The pages, if printed with numbers, would amount to more than &s;even hundred. Many copies of this per|formance are remaining, although the <HI>Her|barius</HI> is become very &s;carce.</P>

<HEAD>GRETE HERBAL.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e books were undoubtedly the foun|dation of the fir&s;t printed botanical work of any con&s;equence, or popularity in <HI>Eng|land;</HI> and which appeared under the title of "The GRETE HERBAL, with cuts;" printed for <HI>Peter Treveris,</HI> as <HI>Ames</HI> tells us, in 1516. Before the impre&s;&s;ion of this book in <HI>England,</HI> &s;ome editions of the "Herba|rius,"
<PB N="47" REF="66">
on the continent, had been aug|mented &s;o far as to contain five hundred figures of plants. The "Grete Herbal" &s;eems to have been well received in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> &s;ince there are &s;ub&s;equent copies, which bear the following dates; 1526, 1529, 1539: and in the Continuation of <HI>Ames,</HI> an edition is mentioned of the "Great Herbal," about the year 1550, "without the cuts." There is al&s;o an edition of this book &s;o late as the year 1561, which is ten years after the date of TURNER's "Herbal." That of 1526 bears the fol|lowing title:</P>

<P>This volume is of the &s;mall folio form; and if printed with numbered pages, would make three hundred and fifty, exclu&s;ive of the Preface and Index. It includes the animal, vegetable, and mineral &s;ub&s;tances, u&s;ed in medicine; and is &s;aid in the Intro|duction to be <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"compyled, compo&s;ed, and auctory&s;ed by divers and many noble Doc|tours and expert May&s;ters in Medycynes; as <HI>Avicenna, Pandecta, Con&s;tantinus, Wil|helmus, Platearius, Rabbi Moy&s;es, Johan|nes Me&s;ue, Haly, Albertus, Bartholomeus,</HI> and more other, &amp;c."</Q></P>
<P>There is no author's name to it; but there are indubitable traces of its being <HI>fa|bricated</HI> from the <HI>Hortus Sanitatis,</HI> and pro|bably from the French tran&s;lation of that work, printed by <HI>Caron,</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> in 1499, with &s;ome alterations and additions.</P>
<P>It abounds with the barbarous and mi&s;|&s;pelt names of the middle ages, and is un|doubtedly the work which TURNER refers
<PB N="49" REF="68">
to in the Preface to his "Herbal," where he ob&s;erves, that, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"as yet there was no Engli&s;h Herbal but one, al full of un|learned cacographees, and fal&s;ely naming of herbs."</Q></P>
<P>The general order is that of the alpha|bet, according to the Latin names, each &s;ubject forming a chapter, in the whole five hundred and five; of which, more than four hundred re&s;pect the vegetable productions; and of the&s;e one hundred and fifty bear the names of plants which are natives of <HI>Eng|land:</HI> but the writer remarks no other di&s;|tinction, by which they are known from the exotics. The names are given in La|tin and Engli&s;h, but throughout the whole &s;carcely any de&s;criptions. The qualities, whether <HI>hot</HI> or <HI>cold, dry</HI> or <HI>moi&s;t,</HI> accord|ing to the Galenic mode of the time, is in|variably noticed, followed generally by a prolix account of the di&s;ea&s;es to which the plant is applicable, and the method of u&s;ing it.</P>
<P>To each is prefixed a coar&s;e wooden-cut figure, as in the <HI>Hortus Sanitatis,</HI> from
<PB N="50" REF="69">
which, on a &s;omewhat &s;maller &s;cale, they are evidently copied; con&s;i&s;ting generally of outlines only. Each block is two inches high, and nearly as wide. Many of the&s;e figures are fictitious, and many mi&s;placed. In a variety of in&s;tances the &s;ame figure is prefixed to different plants, and in very few are they &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ive of the habit, to di&s;criminate even a well-known &s;ubject, if the name applied did not &s;ugge&s;t the idea of it. In &s;ome, the&s;e icons are whim&s;ically ab&s;urd, e&s;pecially in the animals and mine|rals, being al&s;o copies of tho&s;e in the <HI>Hortus Sanitatis.</HI> Tho&s;e of the <HI>Mandrake,</HI> for ex|ample, exhibit two perfectly human figures, with the plant growing from the head of each; though, to do the writer ju&s;tice, he acknowledges, that no &s;uch thing exi&s;ts in nature.

<HEAD>BOTANICAL GARDENS.</HEAD>
<P>The revival of Botany, and the con&s;e|quent e&s;tabli&s;hment of profe&s;&s;or&s;hips, gave ri&s;e to Botanical gardens; a new &s;pecies of luxury in horticulture, of &s;ingular emolument to &s;cience. The hi&s;tory of antient gardens, hi|therto not &s;ufficiently illu&s;trated, merits the inve&s;tigation of the mo&s;t learned and able writer: of the pen of a RAPIN, a MEURSIUS, a SEGUIER, or a GRONOVIUS. We learn, however, that even <HI>Botanical</HI> gardens are of antient date. If it may be credited, what is related of ATTALUS, the la&s;t king of <HI>Per|gamus,</HI> who from his love of phy&s;ic has been &s;tiled the phy&s;ician, he collected in his garden <HI>hellebore, henbane, aconite,</HI> and other poi&s;onous herbs, to make experiments on criminals with counter-poi&s;ons. <HI>Crete,</HI> from
<PB N="53" REF="72">
the earlie&s;t times renowned for the produc|tion of medicinal herbs, was the phy&s;ic-gar|den of <HI>Rome.</HI> The Emperors, we are told, maintained in that i&s;land, herbari&s;ts, and gardeners, to provide the phy&s;icians of <HI>Rome</HI> with &s;imples. <HI>Ca&s;tor,</HI> a Greek, prai&s;ed both by PLINY and GALEN, is &s;aid, not only to have written many volumes con|cerning plants, but to have had a garden at <HI>Rome,</HI> in which, PLINY relates, that CAS|TOR, at upwards of an hundred years of age, demon&s;trated plants, and taught him to di&s;tingui&s;h &s;everal rare and u&s;eful &s;pe|cies.</P>
<P>The utility of the&s;e in&s;titutions are &s;elf|evident. By public gardens, medicinal plants are at the command of the teacher in every le&s;&s;on. By private ones, the eye, and the ta&s;te of the opulent and &s;cientific owner, is perpetually gratified with the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of curious, &s;carce, and exotic luxuries; in comparing the doubtful &s;pecies, and examining them through all the &s;tages of growth, with tho&s;e to which they are allied. Add to which, that all the&s;e ad|vantages are accumulated in a thou&s;and ob|jects
<PB N="54" REF="73">
at the &s;ame time. The fir&s;t public in&s;titution of this kind, in more modern times, was that of <HI>Padua</HI> by the Venetians, in the year 1533. LUCAS GHINUS, the fir&s;t public profe&s;&s;or of Botany in <HI>Europe,</HI> was a &s;trenuous promoter of the &s;ame de|&s;igns; and by his influence procured the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a garden at <HI>Bologna,</HI> in 1547, where TURNER him&s;elf imbibed much of that knowledge, which afterwards gave him &s;uch pre-eminence in his own country.</P>
<P>Among the earlie&s;t private gardens of the &s;ame kind, was that of EURICIUS CORDUS, the di&s;ciple of the venerable LEONICENUS, and of MANARDUS, two of the fir&s;t com|mentators who di&s;played true Botanical critici&s;m, on the works of the antients. CORDUS &s;hewed him&s;elf afterwards worthy of &s;uch ma&s;ters. In his <HI>Botanologicon,</HI> print|ed in 1534, he mentions his own garden, and that of NORDECIUS at <HI>Ca&s;&s;el.</HI> About the &s;ame time there were &s;everal opulent pa|trons of this &s;cience in <HI>Italy, Germany,</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> who followed this example. GES|NER con&s;tructed a garden at <HI>Zurich</HI> in
<PB N="55" REF="74">
1560; the fir&s;t of the kind in <HI>Switzerland.</HI> He not only delineated plants him&s;elf, but maintained, at his own expence, a draught&s;|man and engraver, for the &s;ame purpo&s;es. TURNER appears to have had a garden for rare plants, even during his re&s;idence at <HI>Cologn.</HI> In <HI>England</HI> he records the garden of the duke of <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> at <HI>Sion Hou&s;e,</HI> of which he &s;eems to have had the direc|tion; and, at a later period, as hath been before ob&s;erved, mentions al&s;o his own at <HI>Wells.</HI></P>

with Dr. <HI>William</HI> TURNER, who was un|que&s;tionably the earlie&s;t writer among us, that di&s;covered learning and critical judg|ment in the knowledge of plants; and who&s;e "Book of Herbs," as Dr. BUL|LEYN ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"will always grow green, and never wither as long as <HI>Dio&s;corides</HI> is held in mind by us mortal wights."</Q> But, before I turn my attention to TURNER, I will remark, that, in an interval of thirty-four years between the fir&s;t edition of "The Grete Herbal," in 1516, and that of TURNER, in 1550, I have it not in my power to refer to any publication on my &s;ubject, in the Engli&s;h tongue. That there were tran&s;lations of &s;everal of the writers of the middle ages, has been noticed. Among tho&s;e, on the continent, there were &s;everal by who&s;e means Botany made a rapid pro|gre&s;s. The principal were BRUNSFELSIUS, EURICIUS CORDUS, RUELLIUS, <HI>Valerius</HI> CORDUS, FUCHSIUS, and above all GES|NER, who, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a genius and indu&s;|try, almo&s;t unparalleled in the&s;e &s;tudies, com|prehended this ri&s;ing branch of knowledge, with a more expanded view than any of his
<PB N="59" REF="78">
predece&s;&s;ors, and extended its bounds beyond the limits, which, till that time, <HI>Materia Medica</HI> alone, had pre&s;cribed to it. But GESNER's talents, though in Botany they were original, were &s;till more con&s;picuous in his knowledge of the animal kingdom, in which, his writings will long be valued and e&s;teemed, by tho&s;e e&s;pecially, who, without painful re&s;earches, would &s;ee an|tient literature in a concentrated view. I &s;peak not of his abilities as a philologi&s;t and critic, in which characters he held a di&s;tingui&s;hed place. But to proceed,</P>
<P>WILLIAM TURNER was born at <HI>Mor|peth</HI> in <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and educated at Pembroke college, <HI>Cambridge,</HI> under the patronage and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Sir Thomas Wentworth.</HI> I find him a &s;tudent of that college about the year 1538, where he ac|quired great reputation for his learning. He applied him&s;elf to philo&s;ophy and phy&s;ic, and early di&s;covered an inclination to the &s;tudy of plants, and a wi&s;h to be well ac|quainted with the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> of the antients.</P>
<P>He complains of the little a&s;&s;i&s;tance he
<PB N="60" REF="79">
could receive in the&s;e pur&s;uits. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Being yet a &s;tudent of Pembroke hall, whereas I could learn never one Greke, neither Latin, nor Engli&s;h name, even among&s;t the phy&s;icians, of any herbe or tree: &s;uch was the ignorance at that time; and as yet there was no Engli&s;h Herbal, but one all full of unlearned cacographies and fal&s;ely naming of herbes."</Q></P>
<P>At <HI>Cambridge,</HI> TURNER imbibed the principles of the reformers, and afterwards, agreeably to the practice of many others, united, to the character of the phy&s;ician, that of the divine. He became a preacher, tra|velling into many parts of <HI>England,</HI> and propagated, with &s;o much zeal, the cau&s;e of the reformation, that he excited per&s;e|cution from Bi&s;hop <HI>Gardiner.</HI> He was thrown into pri&s;on, and detained a con&s;i|derable time. On his enlargement, he &s;ub|mitted to voluntary exile, during the re|mainder of the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII.</P>
<P>This bani&s;hment proved favourable to his advancement in medical and botanical &s;tudies; he re&s;ided at <HI>Ba&s;il,</HI> at <HI>Stra&s;burgh,</HI> at <HI>Bonn;</HI> but principally at <HI>Cologn,</HI> with
<PB N="61" REF="80">
many other Engli&s;h refugees. He dwelt for &s;ome time at <HI>Wie&s;&s;enburgh;</HI> he travelled into <HI>Italy,</HI> and took the degree of Doctor of Phy&s;ic at <HI>Ferrara.</HI> As, at this period, the learned were applying with great a&s;&s;i|duity to the illu&s;tration of the antients, it was a fortunate circum&s;tance to Dr. TUR|NER, that he had an opportunity of attend|ing the lectures of <HI>Lucas</HI> GHINUS, at <HI>Bo|logna,</HI> of whom he &s;peaks in his "<HI>Herbal</HI>" with great &s;atisfaction; and frequently cites his authority again&s;t other commentators. GHINUS was the fir&s;t who erected a &s;epa|rate profe&s;&s;orial chair for Botanical &s;cience; from whence he gave lectures on DIOSCO|RIDES, which he continued for twenty-eight years with great applau&s;e. He pro|cured the phy&s;ic-garden to be founded at <HI>Bologna,</HI> to demon&s;trate the plants he &s;poke of. He was the preceptor of CAESALPI|NUS and ANGUILLARA, who became two of the &s;ounde&s;t critics in the knowledge of plants, that the age produced. TURNER re&s;ided a con&s;iderable time at <HI>Ba&s;il,</HI> from which place he dates the dedication of his book "On the Baths of <HI>England</HI> and
<PB N="62" REF="81">
<HI>Germany.</HI>" During his re&s;idence in <HI>Swit|zerland,</HI> he contracted a friend&s;hip with GESNER, and afterwards kept up a corre|&s;pondence with him.</P>
<P>GESNER had a high opinion of TUR|NER, as appears by the following pa&s;&s;age in his book <HI>De Herbis Lunariis,</HI> printed in 1555. <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Ante annos</HI> 15<HI>, aut circiter cum Anglicus ex Italia rediens, me &s;alutaret</HI> (TURNERUS) <HI>is &s;uerit vir excellentis tum in re medica tum aliis pleri&s;que di&s;ciplinis doc|trinae, aut alius qui&s;piam vix &s;atis memini, &amp;c.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>At the acce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Edward</HI> VI. he re|turned to <HI>England,</HI> was incorporated Doc|tor of Phy&s;ic at <HI>Oxford,</HI> appointed Phy&s;i|cian to <HI>Edward</HI> Duke of <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> and, as a divine, was rewarded with a Prebend of <HI>York,</HI> a Canonry of <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> and the Deane|ry of <HI>Wells.</HI> He &s;peaks of him&s;elf in the third part of his Herbal, when treating on the <HI>herba Britannica,</HI> which he took to be the Bi&s;tort, as having been phy&s;ician to the "Erle of <HI>Embden,</HI> Lord of <HI>Ea&s;t Frie&s;|land.</HI>" In 1551 he publi&s;hed the fir&s;t part of his hi&s;tory of plants, which he dedicat|ed
<PB N="63" REF="82">
to the duke, his patron. His zeal in the cau&s;e of the reformation, which he had amply te&s;tified by &s;everal religious tracts, induced him to retreat to the continent, during the whole reign of <HI>Mary.</HI> At her decea&s;e, Queen ELIZABETH rein&s;tated him in all his church preferments. In the de|dication of the compleat edition of his "Herbal" to the queen, in 1568, after complimenting her maje&s;ty on account of her &s;kill in the Latin language, and the fluency with which &s;he conver&s;ed in it, he acknowledges with gratitude, her favours in re&s;toring him to his benefices, and in other ways protecting him from troubles; hav|ing, at four &s;everal times, granted him the great &s;eal for the&s;e purpo&s;es. He &s;eems to have divided his time between his deanery, where he had a Botanical garden, of which frequent mention is made in his "Her|bal," and his hou&s;e in Crutched Friers, <HI>London.</HI> He al&s;o &s;peaks of his garden at <HI>Kew.</HI> From the repeated notices he takes of the plants in <HI>Purbeck,</HI> and about <HI>Port|land,</HI> I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e he mu&s;t have had &s;ome intimate connections in <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="83">
Dr. TURNER died July 7, 1568, a few months after the publication of the la&s;t part of his "Herbal." He left &s;everal children: his &s;on <HI>Peter</HI> was educated to phy&s;ic, tra|velled, and took degrees abroad; was incor|porated doctor at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and at <HI>Oxford;</HI> and died aged 72, in 1614; but I do not find that he inherited his father's turn to Botany.</P>
<P>TURNER's fir&s;t work on the &s;ubject of plants, if BUMALDUS is not mi&s;taken, was printed at <HI>Cologn,</HI> under the title of "<HI>Hi&s;toria de Naturis Herbarum Scholiis et Notis vallata.</HI>" <HI>Colon.</HI> apud Gymnicum 1544. 8^o. <HI>Bumaldus</HI> is the only writer, in whom I find any mention of this book; and I &s;u&s;pect, it was not republi&s;hed in <HI>England.</HI> It was followed by a &s;mall volume under the title of "NAMES OF HERBES, in Greek, Latin, Engli&s;h, Dutch, and French." <HI>Lond.</HI> 12^o. 1548. This nomenclator is, I believe, be|come very &s;carce; &s;ince it has not yet found its way into the copious and magnificent collection of Sir <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> BANKS.</P>
<P>Dr. TURNER's knowledge in natural hi&s;|tory was not confined to Botany; his earlie&s;t
<PB N="65" REF="84">
publication appears to have been, a treati&s;e on birds, under the following title:</P>
<P>"<HI>Avium praecipuarum quarum apud Plini|um et Ari&s;totelem mentio e&s;t brevis et &s;uccinct a hi&s;toria, ex optimis quibu&s;que &s;criptoribus con|texta. Scholio illu&s;trata et aucta. Adjectis nominibus Graecis, Germanicis, et Britannicis.</HI>" Coloniae 1543. 8^o. Not having &s;een this volume, I can only &s;ay, that TURNER is mentioned by his friend GESNER, in re|&s;pectful terms, as an ornithologi&s;t. <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Avium quidem nomina et naturas ante nos et pauci et breviter attigerunt ex quibus Gyb. Longolius Germanus, et Gulielmus</HI> TURNER <HI>Anglus viri docti&s;&s;imi praecipuam merentur laudem.</HI>" <HI>Ge&s;n. Praef. ad Avium Hi&s;t.</HI></Q> TURNER al&s;o contributed to enrich GESNER's mu&s;eum (the fir&s;t collection of that kind,) with na|tural curio&s;ities, which he &s;ent from <HI>Eng|land.</HI> To which I add, that Dr. MERRET gives the following te&s;timony to the worth of TURNER, in the Preface to his "Pinax:" <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Con&s;ului in quibu&s;dam</HI> TURNERUM <HI>no&s;tra|tem inter viros &s;uae aetatis exercitati&s;&s;imum qui librum de avibus edidit mole parvum at judicio majorem.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="85">
Prefixed to the third volume of the <HI>Frankfort</HI> edition of GESNER's <HI>Hi&s;toria Animalium,</HI> in 1620, we find a letter from Dr. TURNER, relating to the Engli&s;h fi&s;hes; which &s;ufficiently proves, that he had no incon&s;iderable degree of knowledge in that part of zoology. He makes an apology for the imperfections of it, as being written from memory, and at a di&s;tance from all his notes and ob&s;ervations. It con&s;i&s;ts of three pages, in which he has briefly de&s;cribed more than fifty &s;pecies; and it &s;eems to be intended principally to give GESNER information on the Engli&s;h names, which TURNER has carefully noted, and often added the pro|vincial appellations. He takes in both &s;ea and river fi&s;h, and includes al&s;o the &s;cal|lop and the cockle. This letter was writ|ten from <HI>Wei&s;&s;enburgh,</HI> and is dated Nov. 1, 1557. He undoubtedly pur&s;ued this branch of zoology much farther; &s;ince it appears from his dedication to the queen, that he intended <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to &s;et out a book of the names and natures of the fi&s;hes of her maje&s;ty's realms."</Q></P>
<P>But the work which &s;ecured his reputa|tion to po&s;terity, and entitled him to the
<PB N="67" REF="86">
character of an original writer on that &s;ub|ject, in <HI>England,</HI> is his "Hi&s;tory of Plants," printed at different times, in three parts, in folio, with cuts. The fir&s;t at <HI>London,</HI> in 1551, under this title, "A NEW HER|BALL, wherein are contayned the names of herbes in Greeke, Latin, Engli&s;h, Duch, Frenche, and in the Potecaries and Herba|ries Latin, with the properties, degrees, and natural places of the &s;ame gathered. For Steven Mierdman." <HI>Lond.</HI> 1551. The &s;econd part at <HI>Cologn,</HI> 1562, during his exile in the reign of <HI>Mary.</HI> With this was reprinted the fir&s;t part; and his "Book on the Bathes of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Germany.</HI>"</P>
<P>In 1568 the&s;e were reprinted, with the addition of the third part, which bears the following title: "The third part of W^m TURNER's HERBAL, wherein are contain|ed the herbes, rootes, and fruytes, whereof is no mention made of <HI>Dio&s;corides, Galene, Plinye,</HI> and other old authors. Imprinted at <HI>Collen,</HI> by Arnold Birckman, in the year of our Lord 1566." The dedication, how|ever, to the company of &s;urgeons, is dated from <HI>Wells,</HI> June 24, 1564.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="87">
Dr. TURNER's "Herbal" is printed in the black letter, agreeably to the general u&s;age of the times, and is embelli&s;hed with the figures of mo&s;t of the plants he de|&s;cribes.</P>
<P>The arrangement is alphabetical, accord|ing to the Latin names; and, after the de|&s;cription, he frequently &s;pecifies the places of growth. He is ample in his di&s;crimina|tion of the &s;pecies, as his great object was, to a&s;certain the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> of the an|cients, and of DIOSCORIDES in particular, throughout the vegetable kingdom. To this end he be&s;tows much critici&s;m on the com|mentaries of FUCHSIUS, TRAGUS, MAT|THIOLUS, and other of his contemporaries; and profe&s;&s;es to have corrected many of their mi&s;takes, in the application of the names of DIOSCORIDES. In all this he has &s;hewn much judgment, and, I may add, much moderation, in avoiding, more than u&s;ual, the licence taken by many of the commen|tators, of applying the names of plants de|&s;cribed in THEOPHRASTUS, DIOSCORIDES, and PLINY, to tho&s;e of the we&s;tern parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> What he &s;ays of the virtues of
<PB N="69" REF="88">
plants, he has drawn from the ancients; but has, in numberle&s;s in&s;tances, given his opinion of their qualities, in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e &s;ages, and recorded his own experi|ence of the virtues. He no where takes any doubtful plants upon tru&s;t, but appears to have examined them with all the preci|&s;ion u&s;ually exerci&s;ed at a time when me|thod, and principles now e&s;tabli&s;hed, were unthought of; every where comparing them with the de&s;criptions of the antients and moderns. He fir&s;t gave names to many Engli&s;h plants; and, allowing for the time when &s;pecifical di&s;tinctions were not e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, when almo&s;t all the &s;mall plants were di&s;regarded, and the <HI>Cryptogamia</HI> almo&s;t wholly overlooked, the number he was acquainted with, is much beyond what could ea&s;ily have been imagined, in an ori|ginal writer on his &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The third part of his "Herbal," dated from <HI>Welles,</HI> June 24, 1564, he dedicates to the company of &s;urgeons; and apologizes for its imperfections: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Being &s;o much vexed with &s;ickne&s;s, and occupied with preaching, and the &s;tudy of divinity, and
<PB N="70" REF="89">
exerci&s;e of di&s;cipline, I have had but &s;mall lei&s;ure to write Herballes."</Q></P>
<P>In this part, he profe&s;&s;es to treat on the plants not known to DIOSCORIDES and the antients. It con&s;i&s;ts of near an hundred articles, among which we find introduced many of the exotic &s;ubjects, which had be|fore been but little known; &s;uch as <HI>ca&s;&s;ia fi&s;tula, cubebs, guaiacum, nutmegs, myroba|lans, nux indica, nux vomica, anacardium, rhubarb, &s;ar&s;aparilla, &s;enna,</HI> and <HI>tamarinds.</HI> For the&s;e, many new figures were cut, which are executed in a &s;tile &s;uperior to the others. The remainder are principally the productions of our own country.</P>
<P>The compleat edition of TURNER's "Her|bal," in 1568, was printed at <HI>Cologn,</HI> un|que&s;tionably to receive the advantage of the figures, probably at that time the property of <HI>Birkman</HI> the printer. They are the &s;ame with which the octavo edition of FUCHSIUS was fir&s;t printed in 1545; in all five hun|dred and twelve. Of the&s;e, TURNER has u&s;ed upwards of four hundred; to which he has added about ninety new, making the whole number five hundred and two.
<PB N="71" REF="90">
There are &s;ome in&s;tances of the wrong ap|plication of the&s;e figures; an error that might readily happen, when the author was at &s;uch a di&s;tance, and was common in al|mo&s;t all &s;imilar works of that time. There are al&s;o &s;everal figures to which no de&s;crip|tion of the plants can be found; for in|&s;tance, the &s;ix figures of the <HI>Geraniums</HI> from FUCHSIUS occur, with a &s;light mention of only two &s;pecies in the text.</P>
<P>TURNER is the fir&s;t author who has given a figure of the Lucern; which, I ap|prehend, he fir&s;t brought into <HI>England,</HI> and named <HI>Horned Clover.</HI> He treats largely of its cultivation, from PLINY, PALLA|DIUS, and COLUMELLA.</P>
<P>In the dedication to the fir&s;t edition of his "Herbal," in 1551, Dr. TURNER &s;peaks in very re&s;pectful terms of the bo|tanical knowledge of &s;everal of his con|temporaries; and apologizes for his under|taking &s;o arduous a matter, while there were learned Engli&s;hmen better qualified. He enumerates Dr. CLEMENT, Dr. MERDY, <HI>Owen</HI> WOOTON, and Ma&s;ter FALCONER.
<PB N="72" REF="91">
The la&s;t-mentioned is &s;everal times introdu|ced in the body of the work. I can &s;carcely doubt that he was <HI>John</HI> FALCONER, who is recorded as having communicated many Engli&s;h plants to AMATUS LUSITANUS, who taught phy&s;ic at <HI>Ferrara</HI> and <HI>Ancona,</HI> and made him&s;elf known as a commentator on DIOSCORIDES in 1553. In treating on the <HI>Glaux,</HI> of which TURNER gives a new figure, he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He never &s;aw it in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> except in Ma&s;ter <HI>Falconer</HI>'s book; and that he brought it from <HI>Italy.</HI>"</Q> From this and other like citations, it may rea&s;on|ably be conjectured, that "<HI>Falconer</HI>'s Book" was an <HI>Hortus Siccus;</HI> and if &s;o, mu&s;t have been among the earlie&s;t collections of that kind, that is noticed in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>In appreciating the merit of Dr. TUR|NER as a Botani&s;t, due regard mu&s;t be had to the time in which he lived; the little a&s;&s;i&s;tance he could derive from his contem|poraries, of whom, BRUNSFELSIUS, RUEL|LIUS, FUCHSIUS, and TRAGUS, when he publi&s;hed his fir&s;t part of the "Herbal," were the chief; in which view, he will ap|pear
<PB N="73" REF="92">
to have exhibited uncommon diligence and great erudition, and fully to de&s;erve the character of an original writer.</P>
<P>Our author paid early attention to mine|ral waters. He was probably the fir&s;t who wrote on the baths of <HI>Bath,</HI> in <HI>Somer&s;et|&s;hire.</HI> He vi&s;ited &s;everal of the mineral &s;prings in <HI>Germany, Switzerland,</HI> and <HI>Italy;</HI> and drew up, whil&s;t abroad, a &s;hort account of ten of tho&s;e waters; to which he pre|fixed a more enlarged hi&s;tory of the waters of <HI>Bath.</HI> This was written, as it &s;hould &s;eem, at <HI>Ba&s;il,</HI> and is dedicated to his <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"well|beloved neighbours of <HI>Bath, Bri&s;tow, Wells, Win&s;am,</HI> and <HI>Charde,</HI>"</Q> March 10, 1557.  He adjudged the principle of Bath water to be brim&s;tone, and po&s;&s;ibly a little copper, from the vicinity of that metal in the neigh|bouring mountains. He &s;ays, he had been in&s;ormed, that, be&s;ides brim&s;tone, the King's bath held alum, and the Cro&s;s bath &s;alt|petre; but that he could find neither. He concludes his account of the baths, by a &s;et of general rules for all who drink mineral waters; many of which do him no di&s;cre|dit,
<PB N="74" REF="93">
when compared with the injunctions of modern phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>Our author al&s;o wrote "On the Nature of Wines commonly u&s;ed in <HI>England,</HI>" in vindication of the u&s;e of Rheni&s;h wines. To this was annexed a tract "On the Na|ture and Vertue of Treacle." But, as I never &s;aw the&s;e treati&s;es, I can give no ac|count of them.</P>
<P>Dr. TURNER was the author of many polemical and religious treati&s;es, chiefly written in defence of the Reformation. Of the&s;e, a li&s;t is given in the <HI>Athenae Oxonien|&s;es,</HI> and a more accurate and enlarged one in Bi&s;hop TANNER's <HI>Bibliotheca.</HI> Several of his tracts are yet in manu&s;cript, in vari|ous libraries. He collated the tran&s;lation of the Bible with Hebrew, Greek, and La|tin copies, and corrected it in many places.</P>
<P>He procured to be printed at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> a new and corrected edition of the <HI>Hi&s;toria Gentis no&s;trae,</HI> &s;. <HI>Angliae,</HI> written by <HI>William of Newburgh,</HI> from a manu&s;cript he found in the library of <HI>Wells;</HI> but complains, that the printer not only omitted to in&s;ert cer|tain
<PB N="75" REF="94">
articles &s;ent by him, but left out the preface he &s;ent him, &s;ub&s;tituting one of his own. Our author al&s;o tran&s;lated &s;everal works from the Latin, particularly "The Compari&s;on of the Old Learning and the New;" written by <HI>Urbanus Regius.</HI> Southwark. 1537. 8^o; and again 1538 and 1548.</P>
<P>I will not conclude this &s;hort memoir of Dr. TURNER, without remarking, that the &s;ucceeding Herbali&s;ts, GERARD, JOHN|SON, and PARKINSON, &s;eem not to have paid due honour to his merit and learn|ing, from the &s;ilence they ob&s;erve rela|ting to him in their writings.

He was born in the I&s;le of <HI>Ely,</HI> in the early part of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth's reign, and was educated at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> though, as <HI>Wood</HI> &s;ays, he afterwards re&s;ided &s;ome time at <HI>Oxford.</HI> It appears that he had travelled over &s;everal parts of <HI>Germany;</HI> that he vi&s;it|ed <HI>Scotland,</HI> and had taken many tours in his native country; in all which, he &s;tudied the natural productions with a zeal and &s;ucce&s;s not common in that age. In an early period of his life, he was much con|ver&s;ant about the city o&s; <HI>Norwich.</HI> In June 1550, he was in&s;tituted to the rectory of <HI>Blaxhall,</HI> in <HI>Suffolk,</HI> where his relations re|&s;ided. This preferment he re&s;igned in 1554. Where he took the degree of doc|tor in phy&s;ic, is not a&s;certained; but, from his prior attachment to phy&s;ic, his known oppo&s;ition to the doctrine of Tran&s;ub&s;tan|tiation, and the re&s;ignation of his living in the beginning of <HI>Mary</HI>'s reign, it may be fairly conjectured, that he did not take his degrees in that faculty till after that period, and probably abroad. A&s;ter this, we find him removed to the city of <HI>Durham,</HI> where he practi&s;ed phy&s;ic, and became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
<PB N="79" REF="98">
property in the &s;alt-pans, near <HI>Tinmouth Ca&s;tle.</HI> On the death of his patron, Sir Thomas <HI>Hilton,</HI> he removed to <HI>London,</HI> where he became a member of the college of phy&s;icians, and acquired reputation as a phy&s;ician, and a man of learning. This event took place about the year 1560. He had the misfortune to lo&s;e great part of his library, with his manu&s;cript upon "Healthfull Medicines," by &s;hipwreck; and after this di&s;a&s;ter, met with mo&s;t un|ju&s;t and malevolent treatment, from a bro|ther of Sir Thomas <HI>Hilton,</HI> by whom he was accu&s;ed of having murdered his late patron, who died, in fact, of a malignant fever. And although his innocence was fully manife&s;ted, yet his enemy per&s;i&s;ting further in his per&s;ecution, found means to throw him into pri&s;on, for debt, where he wrote a great part of his medical treati&s;es. He died Jan. 7, 1576. He appears to have been much attached to the principles of the reformation. Bi&s;hop TANNER &s;ays he was a man of acute judgment and true piety.</P>
<P>I am not acquainted with any print of Dr. TURNER. Of Dr. BULLEYN there is
<PB N="80" REF="99">
a profile with a long beard, before his "Government of Health," and a whole length of him in wood prefixed to the "Bulwarke of Defence;" which book is a collection of mo&s;t of his works. He was an ance&s;tor of the late Dr. STUKELY, who, in 1722, was at the expence of having a &s;mall head of him engraved.</P>
<P>The part of his works, which has the neare&s;t connection with my &s;ubject, is in his "Bulwark of Defence," in fol. 1562.</P>
<P>It is entitled, "A Book of Simples, be|ing an HERBAL in the form of a dia|logue, at the end of which are the cuts of &s;ome plants in wood." In this piece he ob&s;erves, that <HI>tormentil,</HI> in pa&s;tures, prevents the rot in &s;heep; and adds, that the fact was confirmed by the &s;hepherds in &s;undry parts of Norfolk. In his enumera|tion of the virtues of &s;imples, from other authors, he does not fail to record his own experience on the power of &s;everal, in re|moving &s;evere di&s;ea&s;es. Of the effects of Dit|tander, <HI>calamus aromaticus,</HI> the Dai&s;y, and others, he adduces particular in&s;tances. It were to be wi&s;hed, that &s;ucceeding ob&s;erva|tions,
<PB N="81" REF="100">
had confirmed his repre&s;entation. His travels, and the great attention he had paid to the native productions of his own country, had given him a comprehen&s;ive view of the natural fertility of the &s;oil, and climate of <HI>England;</HI> which, from the te|nour of his writings, &s;eems to have been, at that time, by &s;ome people much depreci|ated. He oppo&s;es this idea with patriotic zeal and concern, and alleges various ex|amples, to prove, that we had excellent apples, pears, plums, cherries, and hops, of our own growth, before the impor|tation of the&s;e articles into <HI>England</HI> by the <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> gardeners, but that the culture of them had been greatly ne|glected. He endeavours to confirm the na|tural fertility of the land, from the memor|able in&s;tance of the <HI>&s;ea pea&s;e,</HI> on the beach, near <HI>Orford</HI> and <HI>Aldborough;</HI> by an im|men&s;e crop of which the poor were pre|&s;erved in a time of dearth, in the year 1555. Of which &s;ee further accounts in <HI>John&s;on</HI>'s GERARD, p. 1250; PARKINSON's "<HI>Thea|tre,</HI>" p. 1060; and LOBEL's <HI>Illu&s;tra|tiones,</HI> p. 164.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="101">
To conclude, Dr. Bulleyn's &s;pecific knowledge of Botany &s;eems to have been but &s;lender. His zeal for the promotion of the u&s;eful arts of gardening, the general culture of the land, and the commercial in|tere&s;ts of the kingdom, de&s;erved the highe&s;t prai&s;e, and for the information he has left of the&s;e affairs, in his own time, po&s;terity owe him acknowledgments.</P>
<P>Although the progre&s;s of gardening does not enter into my plan, yet I am tempted, in this place, to remark, that, notwith|&s;tanding culinary herbs and roots, and many fruits, are &s;aid to have been imported in the reign of HENRY <HI>the Eighth,</HI> from <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>France;</HI> and that the true aera of im|provement in this art, cannot be carried, at the mo&s;t remote time, beyond the &s;ame reign, yet it may ju&s;tly be doubted, whether it was then in &s;o low a &s;tate as hath been u&s;ually repre&s;ented. With other arts, in its progre&s;&s;ion we&s;twards, that of Horticul|ture mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to have reached the <HI>Low Countries</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> before <HI>England;</HI> and a general, and prior &s;uperiority to our neighbours may be granted; and that a
<PB N="83" REF="102">
fa&s;hion, and a too great fondne&s;s for ra|rities of foreign growth, might influence the London market, of which the &s;pirit of commerce would not fail to take advan|tage, mu&s;t likewi&s;e be admitted. But, to the arguments and proofs alledged by <HI>Dr.</HI> BULLEYN, in defence of the fertility of his native &s;oil, and the perfection of our own products; and, as a proof of the &s;uc|ce&s;sful cultivation of tho&s;e times, I add, that from an in&s;pection of our old Herbals, and particularly of PARKINSON's <HI>Paradi|&s;us,</HI> we find the various &s;pecies of culinary herbs, roots, and of fruits, multiplied in <HI>England</HI> to &s;uch a variety, as implies a pre|ceding cour&s;e of culture carried on for a &s;eries of time, incon&s;i&s;tent with that po|verty of produce which hath been &s;ur|mi&s;ed.</P>

<HEAD>PENNY.</HEAD>
<P>Having introduced to the reader, the two fir&s;t re&s;pectable writers on Botany in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> I cannot but regret my want of &s;uf|ficient information, to re&s;cue from an al|mo&s;t total ob&s;curity, the name of Dr.
<PB N="84" REF="103">
<HI>Thomas</HI> PENNY, an Engli&s;hman of the &s;ame age; who, although not an author him&s;elf, was indubitably a man of great attainments in the natural hi&s;tory, and e&s;pecially in the Botany, of his time. GERARD &s;tiles him <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A &s;econd <HI>Dio&s;corides,</HI> for his &s;ingular knowledge in plants."</Q> I cannot a&s;certain the date of his birth. It appears that he was a fellow of the royal college of phy&s;i|cians, and that he had travelled into vari|ous parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> He had re&s;ided in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> and had vi&s;ited, if not made &s;ome &s;tay in, the i&s;land of <HI>Majorca.</HI> That he had diligently &s;earched both the northern and &s;outhern parts of <HI>England</HI> is manife&s;t, from the variety of rare plants di&s;covered by him, and communicated to LOBEL and GERARD. He was per&s;onally known to GESNER and CAMERARIUS, and after|wards frequently &s;upplied them with rare plants, for their re&s;pective <HI>Herbaria</HI> and gardens.</P>
<P>During his re&s;idence in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> he collected many plants of that country, and from the confines of <HI>France.</HI> He a&s;&s;i&s;ted GESNER, as appears by his ob&s;ervations
<PB N="85" REF="104">
and animadver&s;ions on that author's tables, publi&s;hed by SCHMIEDEL from the col|lections of TREW, in 1753, in which the mo&s;t honourable te&s;timony is given to his abilities. I &s;u&s;pect he was in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> at the time of GESNER's death, and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed WOLF in arranging the plants, and me|morials of their decea&s;ed friend.</P>
<P>There can be no doubt that PENNY and CLUSIUS were al&s;o per&s;onally acquainted. They appear to have had a &s;trict intimacy, and the latter was obliged to PENNY for a variety of curious articles in&s;erted in his <HI>Rariores,</HI> and in the <HI>Exoticae.</HI> Dr. PENNY brought from <HI>Majorca</HI> the <HI>hypericum ba|learicum,</HI> which CLUSIUS named <HI>myrto|ci&s;tus</HI> PENNAEI after him, as he did a gen|tian, now the <HI>&s;wertia perennis.</HI> The &s;ame of the <HI>geranium tubero&s;um.</HI> The <HI>cornus her|bacea,</HI> that beautiful native of the <HI>Cheviot</HI> hills, was fir&s;t revealed to the curious by this indu&s;trious naturali&s;t.</P>
<P>Dr. PENNY's acquirements in natural hi&s;tory extended beyond the knowledge of plants. He is one of the fir&s;t Engli&s;hmen whom I have met with, who had &s;tudied
<PB N="86" REF="105">
in&s;ects. There are letters witten by him to CAMERARIUS, in the year 1585, pre&s;erved in TREW's collections, which prove his knowledge in <HI>entomology,</HI> to have been exten&s;ive in that day: and it is &s;uppo&s;ed by SCHMIEDEL, that GESNER's drawings of <HI>Papilio</HI>'s, pa&s;&s;ed into the hands of PENNY. This &s;uppo&s;ition is rendered more probable, when it is recollected, that the <HI>Theatrum In&s;ectorum</HI> of MOUFET, was a work begun by <HI>Dr. Edward</HI> WOOTON, <HI>Conraae</HI> GESNER, and Dr. PENNY, and received only the fini&s;hing hand from MOU|FET.</P>
<P>Dr. PENNY died in 1589, and is &s;aid by JUNGERMAN to have left his papers to MOUFET and TURNER; but, in this ac|count there is &s;urely a very &s;triking ana|chroni&s;m, &s;ince TURNER him&s;elf died in the year 1568.</P>

<HEAD>LYTE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>HENRY</HI> LYTE, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of an ancient fa|mily, at <HI>Lytes-Carey,</HI> in <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> was the next after TURNER who publi&s;hed an <HI>Engli&s;h Herbal.</HI> He was born in 1529, and became a &s;tudent at <HI>Oxford</HI> in the lat|ter end of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. about the year 1546. He afterwards travelled; and at length re|tired to his patrimony, where, as <HI>Wood</HI> &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"by the advantage of a good foundation of literature made in the univer&s;ity and abroad, he became a mo&s;t excellent &s;cho|lar in &s;everal &s;orts of learning."</Q> He was the author of various publications of the hi&s;torical kind, which are enumerated in the <HI>Athenae Oxonien&s;es.</HI> He died at the age of 78,
<PB N="89" REF="108">
and was buried at <HI>Charlton-Mackerel,</HI> in the &s;ame county. He left a &s;on, who drew up a genealogy of <HI>James</HI> I. for which the king rewarded him with his picture in gold, &s;et with diamonds; and the prince, afterwards <HI>Charles</HI> I. gave him al&s;o his picture in gold.</P>
<P>Although Mr. LYTE does not rank a|mong original writers in Botany, his work neverthele&s;s &s;eems to have been well re|ceived. Even the arrangement alone would in&s;tantly give it a great advantage over <HI>Turner</HI>'s book. It is profe&s;&s;edly a tran&s;la|tion from the French ver&s;ion of the Dutch Herbal of DODOENS, written by the au|thor in 1553, and tran&s;lated by <HI>Clu&s;ius</HI> in 1557; being the fir&s;t of his publications. Of DODOENS, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to give &s;ome account; but I &s;hall defer it till I &s;peak of GERARD, as the improved editions of DO|DOENS's book were the ba&s;is of that au|thor's work.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t edition of LYTE's Herbal was publi&s;hed at <HI>Antwerp.</HI> It is printed in the black letter, and bears the following title:</P>
<P>"A NIEWE HERBALL, or HISTORIE OF
<PB N="90" REF="109">
PLANTES, wherein is contayned the whole di&s;cour&s;e and perfect de&s;cription of all &s;orts of herbs and plantes; their divers and &s;un|dry kindes; their &s;traunge figures, fa&s;hions, and &s;hapes; their names, natures, and ope|rations and vertues: and that not only of tho&s;e which are here growyng in this our countrie of Englande, but of all others al&s;o of forayne realmes, commonly u&s;ed in phy|&s;icke. Fir&s;t &s;et forth in the Doutche or Almaigne tongue, by that learned D. <HI>Rem|bert</HI> DODOENS, phy&s;ition to the emperor; and now fir&s;t tran&s;lated by
"<HI>Henry</HI> LYTE, <HI>E&s;quyer.</HI>
At London, by me, <HI>Gerard Dewes.</HI> 1578."&mdash;The Colophon, "imprinted at <HI>Antwerpe,</HI> by me, <HI>Henry Loe,</HI> book-printer." pp. 779.</P>
<P>Mr. LYTE dedicates his work to queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> and has prefixed the preface and appendix in Latin, from DODOENS, or DODONAEUS. The latter of the&s;e is a col|lection from DIOSCORIDES and CATO, but chiefly from PLINY, relating to the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of botanical and agricultural
<PB N="91" REF="110">
knowledge among the Romans; and in commendation of gardens, with rules for laying them out, and managing them to advantage.</P>
<P>He has followed his original in dividing his &s;ubjects into &s;ix books; and, although the general arrangement is confu&s;ed, LYTE has the merit of having introduced a parti|cular order in each chapter, or genus, much &s;uperior to that of TURNER; having di|vided the &s;pecies, de&s;cription, place, time, names, nature, and virtues, under the&s;e &s;e|veral titles, into di&s;tinct &s;ections. This ar|rangement was adopted by GERARD and PARKINSON.</P>
<P>LYTE de&s;cribes one thou&s;and and fifty &s;pecies, of which eight hundred and &s;eventy are figured. The blocks are, I believe, the &s;ame with which CLUSIUS's own tran&s;la|tion was printed; being, as far as tho&s;e ex|tend, copies from the octavo edition of FUCHSIUS. Mo&s;t of TURNER's figures are found in LYTE. The remainder are &s;uch as had been cut for the &s;ub&s;equent works of DODOENS, and afterwards embelli&s;hed the <HI>Pemptades</HI> of that author, and GERARD's
<PB N="92" REF="111">
hi&s;tory. The Engli&s;h tran&s;lator added about thirty new ones. Among the&s;e, &s;everal are in a &s;tyle &s;uperior to tho&s;e of CLUSIUS and GERARD; &s;uch are particularly, the <HI>Salvia Aethiops;</HI> the <HI>Stratiotes aloides;</HI> the <HI>Rha,</HI> or <HI>Centaurea Rhaponticum;</HI> and others.</P>
<P>Some are original: I cite only the <HI>Erica Tetralix,</HI> of which I find no figure prior to <HI>Lyte</HI>'s; that of GERARD (or, which is the &s;ame, of <HI>Clu&s;ius</HI>) applied to it by JOHN|SON, being certainly intended to repre&s;ent another &s;pecies, and is accordingly referred to the <HI>Mediterranea</HI> by LINNAEUS.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t edition of <HI>Lyte</HI> is adorned with a finely-cut impre&s;&s;ion in wood of DODO|ENS, in the thirty-fifth year of his age; and a large engraving of Mr. <HI>Lyte</HI>'s coat of arms.</P>
<P>This fir&s;t edition was undoubtedly printed at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> to receive the advantage of the figures. The &s;ub&s;equent editions, there|fore, afterwards printed in <HI>England,</HI> are without figures. It was reprinted, as <HI>Ames</HI> informs us, in 1586, and in 1595; and, according to <HI>Wood,</HI> by <HI>Ninion Newton,</HI> at <HI>London,</HI> in 1589, in quarto al&s;o, without
<PB N="93" REF="112">
cuts. I find editions mentioned, with the dates 1600 and 1619, which, if genuine, and not in the title-page only, is a proof of its popularity; and that it was not &s;uper|&s;eded by the larger work of GERARD in 1597. SEGUIER even quotes one, &s;o late as the year 1678.</P>
<P>As in the interval between the publica|tion of CLUSIUS's French tran&s;lation in 1557, and the Engli&s;h ver&s;ion of it by LYTE in 1578, the author had at different times compleated the &s;everal parts of his <HI>Hi&s;toriae Plantarum,</HI> it may be pre&s;umed, that LYTE profited by tho&s;e works. From &s;ome of the commendatory ver&s;es prefixed, it &s;hould &s;eem, that <HI>Dodoens</HI> him&s;elf com|municated additions to LYTE. As I have not had an opportunity of comparing the French ver&s;ion of <HI>Clu&s;ius</HI> with LYTE, I cannot notice the nature of his alterations, or the extent of his additions. The intro|duction of the Engli&s;h names was a nece&s;|&s;ary augmentation.</P>
<P>In the mean time, there &s;eems to be no ground for the critici&s;m of THRELKELD; who accu&s;es LYTE of having omitted the
<PB N="94" REF="113">
<HI>Purgantium Hi&s;toria</HI> of DODONAEUS, of which LYTE appears unque&s;tionably to have introduced the mo&s;t material &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Engli&s;h Botany, however, received little or no acce&s;&s;ion from LYTE him&s;elf. It is not in more than about twenty in&s;tances, that he has even pointed out the local &s;itu|ation of any rare Engli&s;h plants; and, in the&s;e in&s;tances, there is &s;carcely one, which had not been thus <HI>&s;pecifically</HI> recorded by TURNER and LOBEL, before him.</P>
<P>Hence, I am not able to give LYTE the credit, although he lived at &s;o early a pe|riod, of being the fir&s;t di&s;coverer of a &s;in|gle &s;pecies of rare growth. Yet, as it is but ju&s;tice to &s;uppo&s;e him well acquainted with all the common plants, &s;o a large number of the&s;e, which had been unnoticed by TURNER, or are not ea&s;ily a&s;certained in his work, will be found fir&s;t announced to the Engli&s;h Botani&s;t in LYTE. I con|fe&s;s, however, that it is extremely difficult to determine, in a variety of in&s;tances, whe|ther the general places of growth, as men|tioned in this author, are in&s;erted from his own knowledge, or whether they &s;tand as
<PB N="95" REF="114">
tran&s;lated by him from CLUSIUS. It is this doubt that has induced me, not unfre|quently, to a&s;cribe to GERARD, or JOHN|SON, the fir&s;t knowledge of many common plants certainly a&s;certained by them, that occur, neverthele&s;s, in LYTE's work.</P>
<P>This author furni&s;hes very few ob&s;erva|tions which tend to illu&s;trate the &s;tate of the &s;cience, between the time of TURNER and his own. Nor does he mention, in more than one or two in&s;tances, any of his contemporaries. Under the article <HI>Verba&s;|cum,</HI> he &s;peaks of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the plea&s;ant garden of <HI>James Champaigne,</HI> the deer friende and lover of plantes:"</Q> but without any infor|mation of his character, or place of abode. And, under that of <HI>Sweet Trefoil,</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the garden of mai&s;ter Rich."</Q></P>

<HI>Lord Zouch,</HI> whom he attended in 1592, in his emba&s;&s;y to the court of <HI>Denmark.</HI> This tour furni&s;hed him with further means of augmenting his knowledge in Botany; and, through the corre&s;pondence he formed there, of introducing into <HI>England</HI> &s;everal exotic rarities, before that time un|known to this country. He had the &s;uperin|tendance of a garden at <HI>Hackney,</HI> which he calls a phy&s;ic-garden, cultivated at the ex|pence of his patron. He was afterwards &s;tiled Botani&s;t to King <HI>James,</HI> as appears by the <HI>imprimatur</HI> to the &s;econd edition of the <HI>Adver&s;aria;</HI> and by his own letter prefixed to GERARD's "Herbal." Whether any emolument was annexed to this title, I am unable to decide. He had a daughter married to a Mr. <HI>James</HI> COEL, who lived at <HI>Highgate,</HI> near <HI>London;</HI> and it is pro|bable, from the very frequent mention that LOBEL makes of that place in his la&s;t work, the <HI>Illu&s;trationes,</HI> that he re&s;ided in the latter years of his life with his &s;on-in-law.</P>
<P>He died in 1616, aged 78. There was a print of LOBEL, but it is very &s;carce, I have

only &s;een it in the collection of the late Mr. <HI>Gul&s;ton.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t of LOBEL's publications, and which more eminently agrees with the de|&s;ign of this work, as it brought a large ac|ce&s;&s;ion to Engli&s;h Botany, was the <HI>Stirpium Adver&s;aria.</HI> The profe&s;&s;ed intention of this work was to inve&s;tigate the Botany and <HI>materia medica</HI> of the antients, and parti|cularly of DIOSCORIDES; and LOBEL is judged to have corrected the errors of MATTHIOLUS, upon that author, in many in&s;tances.</P>
<P>As PENA was jointly concerned with LOBEL in this work, it is become impo&s;|&s;ible, at this time, to a&s;&s;ign to each their &s;eparate &s;hare. The fir&s;t edition of the <HI>Adver&s;aria,</HI> dated at <HI>London</HI> 1570, was dedicated to the queen. This dedication was omitted in an edition printed at <HI>Ant|werp</HI> in 1576. Editions bearing date 1571, 1572, are recorded, but it may be doubted whether the&s;e were more than title-page alterations. To that of the whole <HI>Adver|&s;aria,</HI> which bears date London 1605, by <HI>Purfoot</HI> al&s;o, is prefixed LOBEL's <HI>Animad|ver&s;iones</HI>

<P>In the execution of this work, there is exhibited, I believe, the fir&s;t &s;ketch, rude as it is, of a natural method of arrange|ment; which, however, extends no far|ther than throwing the plants into large tribes, families, or orders, according to the external appearance, or habit of the whole plant or flower; without e&s;tabli&s;h|ing any definitions or characters. The whole forms forty-four tribes. Some con|tain
<PB N="102" REF="121">
the plants of one, or two modern <HI>ge|nera:</HI> others many; and &s;ome, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, very incongruous to each other. On the whole, they are much &s;uperior to DODOENS's divi&s;ions; and &s;ufficiently te&s;|tify, that the author was &s;en&s;ible of the want of a better arrangement than the mere alphabetic order, or that formed from the &s;uppo&s;ed qualities, and u&s;es in medicine.</P>
<P>At the head of each tribe, or family, he prefixes a &s;ynoptical view of all the &s;pecies to be de&s;cribed under it. His method, then, is to give the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> name; and, wherever he can, the name of the genus and &s;pecies, in <HI>German, Dutch, French,</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> Then the de&s;cription of the plant, the time of flowering, the country in which it grows &s;pontaneou&s;ly; and, in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> he points out the particular &s;pot, where &s;ome of the more rare are found: Mr. RAY, however, has remarked, that in this re&s;pect LOBEL has been inaccurate, or tru&s;ted too much to his memory; &s;ince many have been &s;ought for in vain, in the &s;ituations he &s;pecified. Frequent reference is made in the margin to the figures in

<P>LOBEL having carefully &s;tudied the an|tients, on the <HI>Materia Medica;</HI> having tra|velled much, and &s;een plants in various countries, was enabled to exerci&s;e critical &s;kill, and to detect numerous errors in the di&s;pen&s;ation of &s;imples, which he does not fail to point out. His &s;trong attachment to the &s;tudy intere&s;ted him powerfully in the inve&s;tigation of new plants, and enabled him to make large acce&s;&s;ions to knowledge. He travelled over various parts of <HI>England,</HI> and di&s;covered many vegetables before unnoticed. He added to the <HI>gra&s;&s;es</HI> a number of new &s;pecies; and, although his &s;tile is univer|&s;ally condemned as har&s;h and incorrect, and his de&s;criptions frequently ob&s;cure and in|&s;ufficient, the <HI>Adver&s;aria</HI> has, on the whole, great merit, abounding with much curious intelligence, and &s;ome new di&s;coveries.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="123">
The &s;econd part of the <HI>Adver&s;aria</HI> is but a &s;mall part of the whole. It pre&s;ents us with a li&s;t of one hundred and thirty &s;pe|cies of gra&s;&s;es, known to the author: this is followed by the figures and de&s;criptions of &s;ome new and rare kinds, of the &s;ame tribe.

<P>In 1576, LOBEL publi&s;hed a book, well known, and much quoted &s;ince, by the name of "OBSERVATIONES; <HI>&s;ive Stirpium Hi&s;toriae, cui annexum e&s;t Adver&s;ariorum Vo|lumen. In fol. cum Iconibus.</HI>"</P>
<P>By the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Plantin,</HI> this volume was accompanied with 1486 figures, which had been cut for the works of CLUSIUS, MATTHIOLUS, and DODONAEUS.</P>

Some of the&s;e im|pre&s;&s;ions were accompanied with an index, in &s;even languages, which rendered it a very popular book for many years. It pre&s;erves &s;ome value to this day, as being the edi|tion that LINNAEUS quotes throughout his works.</P>
<P>LOBEL had meditated a very large work, which was to have borne the title of "IL|LUSTRATIONES PLANTARUM;" but he lived not to fini&s;h it. Some of his papers fell into the hands of PARKINSON, and were incorporated into his <HI>Theatrum.</HI> A frag|ment of the above-mentioned work was publi&s;hed by Dr. How, in 1655; which contains the de&s;criptions of many gra&s;&s;es, and other plants newly di&s;covered, or lately introduced. Of the gra&s;&s;es, many here re|corded were fir&s;t di&s;covered by LOBEL.

<P>There is "an Herbal to the Bible," &s;aid to be written by <HI>Thomas</HI> NEWTON, and printed in 1587. 8^o. This author, after having practi&s;ed phy&s;ic, became a divine and &s;choolma&s;ter, at <HI>Ilford,</HI> in <HI>E&s;&s;ex;</HI> where he died in 1607. His book, I believe, is only a tran&s;lation of "LEVINI LEMNII <HI>Expli|catia Similitudinum quae in Bibliis ex herbis et arboribus &s;umuntur.</HI>" LEMNIUS, who was a phy&s;ician in the province of <HI>Zealand,</HI> briefly de&s;cribes the plants of the holy Scrip|tures, and produces a number of curious philological ob&s;ervations re&s;pecting the u&s;es of plants in ceremonial and &s;acred rites.

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>GERARD.</HEAD>
<P>LOBEL's writings, how&s;oever e&s;teem|ed by the learned, having never been tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h, could not become popular; and, at the conclu&s;ion of the &s;ix|teenth century, TURNER's book was, pro|bably no le&s;s ob&s;olete, than LYTE's was imperfect. The&s;e circum&s;tances, con&s;piring with the growing ta&s;te of the times for gar|dening, it may be pre&s;umed, incited GE|RARD to undertake his Herbal: a work which maintained its credit and e&s;teem for more than a century; and, plea&s;ing as it is to reflect on the rapid progre&s;s and im|provement of Botany, within the la&s;t half century, yet there are many now living who
<PB N="111" REF="130">
can recollect, that when they were young in &s;cience, there was no better &s;ource of Bota|nical intelligence, in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> tongue, than the Herbals of GERARD and PARK|INSON.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved, that the early edi|tion of DODOENS's book, as tran&s;lated by CLUSIUS, had been the ba&s;is of LYTE's Herbal; and, as the la&s;t edition of the &s;ame author became the foundation of GE|RARD's, this circum&s;tance renders it not un&s;uitable here to take &s;ome notice of an author, although a foreigner, to whom he owed &s;o much of that credit, which has pre&s;erved his memory to the pre&s;ent times.</P>
<P><HI>Rembert</HI> DODOENS, or DODONAEUS, was born in 1517, near <HI>Mechlin</HI> in <HI>Flanders.</HI> He became con&s;picuous for his various eru|dition when young; was phy&s;ician for &s;ome time to the Emperor <HI>Maximilian,</HI> and his &s;on <HI>Rodolph</HI> II. The importunity of his friends procured his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from the Emperor's &s;ervice, and he &s;ettled at <HI>Ant|werp;</HI> was afterwards profe&s;&s;or at <HI>Leyden,</HI> and died in 1586. He wrote on a&s;tronomy, geography, and phy&s;ic; but is remembered
<PB N="112" REF="131">
now, principally, by his botanical works. His attachment to this &s;tudy, and the op|portunities he enjoyed of gratifying it, en|abled him to turn it to the mo&s;t advantage|ous purpo&s;es. He began to publi&s;h in 1552, and continued his acce&s;&s;ions and improve|ments to the year 1583, when he collected all his writings, on this &s;ubject, into one volume, under the following title, "STIR|PIUM HISTORIAE PEMPTADES <HI>Sex, &s;ive Libri</HI> XXX. <HI>Ant. ex officin. Plant.</HI>" <HI>in folio. cum icon.</HI> 1341. <HI>pp.</HI> 872. Each Pemptade is divided into five books.</P>
<P>The 1&s;t comprehends a number of di&s;|&s;imilar plants in alphabetic order.</P>
<P N="2">2. Flower-garden plants; and the um|belliferous tribe.</P>
<P N="3">3. Medicinal roots: purgative plants: climbing and poi&s;onous plants: ferns, mo&s;&s;es, and fungi.</P>
<P N="4">4. Grain: pul&s;e: gra&s;&s;es: water and mar&s;h plants.</P>
<P N="5">5. Edible plants: gourd plants: e&s;culent roots: oleraceous: thi&s;tles and &s;pino&s;e plants.</P>
<P N="6">6. Shrubs and trees.</P>
<P>It was reprinted in 1612 and 1616, with
<PB N="113" REF="132">
&s;ome &s;mall additions, and being tran&s;lated al&s;o into Dutch, with great enlargement, became a popular book in that language.</P>
<P>The judicious &s;election of all that was u&s;eful, relating to the &s;uppo&s;ed plants of the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> of DIOSCORIDES, and of the Arabians, the introduction of all the new &s;pecies from CLUSIUS, and other di&s;|coveries of the time, added to the in&s;truction and embelli&s;hment derived from the figures, which exceeded in number tho&s;e of any preceding author, rendered <HI>Dodoens</HI>'s book u&s;eful to the medical profe&s;&s;ion throughout the world. It &s;till pre&s;erves &s;ome value, as being referred to by LINNAEUS, for the illu&s;tration of the European plants.</P>
<P>As GERARD could not attempt an entire new work, there was then extant no other to which he could give the preference, as a ba&s;is to his de&s;ign; for as &s;uch only it mu&s;t be con&s;idered, &s;ince the interval of time between the publication of DODO|NAEUS's work in 1583, and the printing of his own "Herbal," had given him opportuni|ties to inter&s;per&s;e large additions, both in exotic, and indigenous Botany. In this in|terval
<PB N="114" REF="133">
the &s;cience had been augmented, and not le&s;s enriched, by the writings of CAE|SALPINUS, in 1583; by the <HI>Epitom&eacute;</HI> of CAMERARIUS, in 1586; by the <HI>Hi&s;toria Lugdunen&s;is</HI> of DALECHAMP, in 1587; by the <HI>Sylva Harcynia</HI> of THALIUS; and e&s;|pecially by the <HI>Hi&s;toria</HI> and <HI>Icones</HI> of TA|BERNAEMONTANUS, in 1588 and 1590.</P>
<P>To the&s;e may be added, a number of collateral re&s;ources, which the growing commerce and &s;pirit of the times rendered favourable to his purpo&s;es. I will briefly mention the following: the <HI>Materia Me|dica</HI> had, for a &s;eries of years, been per|petually augmenting, by a variety of new drugs, which were eagerly &s;ought after, the origin of which, notwith&s;tanding, was in many in&s;tances ob&s;cure, and in others as yet unknown. At length the publication of GARCIAS <HI>ab</HI> HORTO on the &s;imples of the Ea&s;t Indies, of MONARDES on tho&s;e of the We&s;t, and afterwards of <HI>Chri&s;topher &agrave;</HI> COSTA's book, &s;atisfied, for a time, the impatience of the public.</P>
<P>The&s;e authors were tran&s;lated into Eng|li&s;h. <HI>James</HI> FRAMPTON, a merchant of
<PB N="115" REF="134">
London, who had re&s;ided long at <HI>Seville,</HI> from whence he returned in 1576, tran&s;|lated MONARDES into Engli&s;h the next year, under the title of "Joyful News out of the New Founde World, from the Spa|ni&s;h of <HI>Monardus,</HI>" in 4^o. CLUSIUS put GARCIAS <HI>ab</HI> HORTO into Latin, in 1567; and <HI>James</HI> GARET had al&s;o tran&s;lated from the Spani&s;h the work of <HI>&agrave;</HI> COSTA. The&s;e books were incentives to curio&s;ity; and the thou&s;and novelties which were brought into <HI>England</HI> by our circumnavigators, RA|LEIGH and CAVENDISH, in 1580 and 1588, excited a degree of attention, which at this day cannot, without the aid of con|&s;iderable recollection, be ea&s;ily conceived. RALEIGH him&s;elf appears to have po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed a larger &s;hare of ta&s;te for the curious productions of nature, than was common to the &s;eafaring adventurers of that period. And po&s;terity will rank the&s;e voyagers among the greate&s;t benefactors to this kingdom, in having been the means, if tradition may be credited, of introducing the mo&s;t u&s;eful root that Providence has held forth for the &s;er|vice of man. A voyage round the globe, how|&s;oever
<PB N="116" REF="135">
familiarized in ours, was in that age a mo&s;t intere&s;ting and fruitful occa&s;ion of enquiry.</P>
<P>The return of RALEIGH, and the fame of his manifold di&s;coveries and collections, brought over from the continent the cele|brated CLUSIUS, then in the 55th year of his age. He, who added more to the &s;tock of Botany in his day, than all his contem|poraries united, vi&s;ited ENGLAND, for the third time, to partake, at this critical junc|ture, in the general gratification.</P>
<P>At this eventful period, GERARD was in the vigour of life, and without doubt felt the influence, and reaped the advantage of all the circum&s;tances I have enumerated.</P>
<P><HI>John</HI> GERARD was born at <HI>Nantwich,</HI> in <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> in the year 1545, and was edu|cated a &s;urgeon. He removed to <HI>London,</HI> where he obtained the patronage of the great <HI>Lord Burleigh,</HI> who was him&s;elf a lover of plants, and had the be&s;t collection in his garden of any nobleman in the king|dom. GERARD had the &s;uperintendance of this fine garden, and retained his em|ployment, as he tells us him&s;elf, for twenty
<PB N="117" REF="136">
years. He lived in <HI>Holborn,</HI> where al&s;o he had a large <HI>phy&s;ic</HI> garden of his own; which was probably the fir&s;t of the kind in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> for the number and variety of its pro|ductions. It &s;hould &s;eem, that in his younger days he had taken a voyage into the Baltic, &s;ince he mentions having &s;een the wild pines growing about <HI>Narva.</HI></P>
<P>GERARD appears al&s;o to have been fa|voured by the college of phy&s;icians, and is highly extolled by Dr. BULLEYN. Both LOBEL, and Dr. BROWNE, phy&s;ician to the queen, wrote, in Latin, commendatory letters to him, on the publication of his Herbal. He attained to &s;uch eminence in his profe&s;&s;ion, as to be cho&s;en ma&s;ter of the company. He died about the year 1607.</P>
<P>There is a half &s;heet print of GERARD prefixed to his own edition of the "Her|bal," done in the 53d year of his age, and a &s;mall oval one at the bottom of a full half &s;heet fronti&s;piece, before JOHNSON's edi|tion.</P>
<P>The earlie&s;t publication of GERARD was the li&s;t of his own garden in Holborn,
<PB N="118" REF="137">
under the following title, "<HI>Catalogus Ar|borum, Fruticum, ac Plantarum, tam indige|narum quam exoticarum, in horto</HI> JOHANNIS GERARDI, <HI>civis ac chirurgi Londinen&s;is na&s;|centium.</HI> Impen&s;is J. Norton, 1596." 4^o. and again in 1599.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t edition was dedicated to Lord BURLEIGH; but that nobleman dying be|fore the publication of the &s;econd, it was in&s;cribed to his patron, <HI>Sir Walter</HI> RA|LEIGH.</P>
<P>This little piece, from the nature of the publication, is become very &s;carce. I be|lieve there is only a manu&s;cript copy of it in the collection of <HI>Sir</HI> JOSEPH BANKS.</P>
<P>We are informed, in the life of Dr. BUL|LEYN, that GERARD's Garden contained near eleven hundred &s;orts of plants, of fo|reign and dome&s;tic growth; from whence, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Oldys,</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it may appear, that our ground would produce other fruits be|&s;ides hips and haws, acorns and pignuts;"</Q> for at this time, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"kitchen-garden wares were imported from Holland, and fruits from France."</Q> There are one thou&s;and

and thirty-three &s;pecies in this Catalogue, and the following atte&s;tation, written by LOBEL, is annexed.</P>

<P>In 1597, came out his "HERBAL, or GENERAL HISTORY OF PLANTS;" printed by John Norton, in folio; and &s;ome authors mention another impre&s;&s;ion in 1599.</P>
<P>That the foundation of this work was a tran&s;lation of DODOENS's Herbal, a compa|ri&s;on of the two a&s;certains beyond a doubt. LOBEL, both in his animadver&s;ions on RON|DELETIUS, and in his <HI>Stirpium Illu&s;tratio|nes,</HI> informs us, that Dr. PRIEST, at the expence of Mr. <HI>Norton,</HI> had been engaged to make a tran&s;lation of DODONAEUS's <HI>Pemp|tades;</HI> and, dying &s;oon after he had fini&s;hed it, the manu&s;cript came into GERARD's
<PB N="120" REF="139">
hands; who has been cen&s;ured for having endeavoured to conceal his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the&s;e papers, and for a&s;&s;uming to him&s;elf the me|rit of the tran&s;lation, when it is generally agreed, that his knowledge of the Latin language was not equal to &s;uch an under|taking. LOBEL, indeed, judged the &s;ame of Dr. PRIEST, and points out in&s;tances of his in&s;ufficiency. It mu&s;t, however, be al|lowed, that GERARD is not backward in confe&s;&s;ing his want of &s;kill in the learned languages. LOBEL farther informs us, that when the work was in the pre&s;s, and that part of the fir&s;t book printed relating to gra&s;&s;es, his friend, <HI>James</HI> GARET, a per&s;on eminently &s;killed in flowers and exotics, ad|moni&s;hed <HI>Norton</HI> of &s;ome gro&s;s errors; on which, the printer engaged LOBEL to &s;u|perintend the work; that he actually did correct it "in a thou&s;and places;" and that there were many other mi&s;takes, which GERARD would not allow him to alter, alleging that it was &s;ufficiently correct, and that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"LOBEL had forgotten the Engli&s;h language."</Q></P>
<P>In order further to conceal his plagiari&s;m,
<PB N="121" REF="140">
LOBEL adds, that he has inverted the di&s;tri|bution of the chapters in DODOENS's book, and adopted that of the <HI>Adver&s;aria.</HI> This may be con&s;idered as a futile objection, and even turned into an approbation of LOBEL's method; but he charges him al&s;o with largely plundering the <HI>Adver&s;aria,</HI> without any acknowledgment.</P>
<P>GERARD compri&s;es the whole vegetable kingdom in three books. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> con|tains the gra&s;&s;es, grain, ru&s;hes, reeds, flags, and bulbous-rooted plants. The <HI>&s;econd,</HI> all herbs u&s;ed in diet, phy&s;ic, or for ornament and plea&s;ure. The <HI>third,</HI> trees, &s;hrubs, fruit|bearing plants, ro&s;ins, gums, ro&s;es, heaths, mo&s;&s;es, mu&s;hrooms, and &s;ea plants. The whole divided into upwards of eight hun|dred chapters, which, in the arrangement of that time, may, if the expre&s;&s;ion is al|lowable, be con&s;idered as &s;o many genera.</P>
<P>In each chapter the &s;everal &s;pecies are de&s;cribed; then follow the place, time of flowering, names, and virtues.</P>
<P>The figures Mr. <HI>Norton</HI> procured from <HI>Frankfort,</HI> being the &s;ame blocks which had been u&s;ed for the Dutch Herbal of TABER|NAEMONTANUS
<PB N="122" REF="141">
in 1588. In this manner, GERARD, with DODOENS for his founda|tion, by taking in al&s;o many plants from CLUSIUS, and from LOBEL, by the addition of &s;ome from his own &s;tock, publi&s;hed a volume, which, from its being well timed, from its comprehending almo&s;t the whole of the &s;ubjects then known, by being writ|ten in Engli&s;h, and ornamented with a more numerous &s;et of figures than had ever ac|companied any work of the kind in this kingdom, obtained great repute. To this we mu&s;t add the fortunate circum&s;tance of its acquiring afterwards &s;o learned an edi|tor as JOHNSON, which e&s;tabli&s;hed the cha|racter of it, and gave it precedence as a po|pular book, for more than a century. And notwith&s;tanding his manife&s;t inferiority to LOBEL in point of learning, it mu&s;t yet be owned, that GERARD contributed greatly to bring forward the knowledge of plants in <HI>England.</HI> His connection with the great, and his &s;ituation in <HI>London,</HI> favoured an ex|ten&s;ive corre&s;pondence, both with foreigners and his own countrymen; and his &s;ucce&s;s in procuring new exotics, as well as &s;carce
<PB N="123" REF="142">
indigenous plants, was equal to his diligence and a&s;&s;iduity. In fact, we owe to GERARD and his friends the di&s;covery of many new Engli&s;h plants; and his name will be re|membered by botani&s;ts with e&s;teem, when the utility of his Herbal is &s;uper&s;eded. That he was con&s;idered as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a very exten&s;ive &s;hare of this &s;cience, we are ju&s;tified in believing, on the te&s;timony of Mr. <HI>George</HI> BAKER, chief &s;urgeon to the queen, who a&s;&s;ures us, that he &s;aw him <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"tried with one of the be&s;t &s;trangers that ever came into <HI>England,</HI> and was ac|counted in <HI>Paris</HI> the only man, being recommended to me," &s;ays BAKER, "by that famous man, AMBROSE PAREY; and he being here, was de&s;irous to go abroad with &s;ome of our herbari&s;ts, for the which I was the mean to bring them together, and one whole day we &s;pent therein, &s;earching the rare&s;t &s;imples: but when it came to the trial, my French|man did not know one to his four<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">PLUMIER gave the name GERARDIA to a plant of the <HI>didynamous</HI> cla&s;s, di&s;covered in thetropical regions of America; to which LINNAEUS has &s;ince added five &s;pe|cies.</NOTE>."</Q></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>JOHNSON.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THOMAS</HI> JOHNSON was born at <HI>Sel|by,</HI> in <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> and bred an apothe|cary in <HI>London.</HI> He afterwards kept a &s;hop on <HI>Snow-Hill,</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"where, by his un|wearied pains, advanced with good natu|ral parts," &s;ays Mr. <HI>Wood,</HI> "he attained to be the be&s;t herbali&s;t of his age in <HI>Eng|land.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>He was fir&s;t announced to the public, by a &s;mall piece under the title of "ITER IN AGRUM CANTIANUM, 1629; <HI>et</HI> ERI|CETUM HAMSTEDIANUM, 1632: which
<PB N="127" REF="146">
were the fir&s;t local catalogues publi&s;hed in <HI>England.</HI> He &s;oon after acquired great credit by his new edition and emendation of GE|RARD's "Herbal."</P>
<P>In the civil wars, his zeal for the royal cau&s;e led him into the army, in which he greatly di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf; and the uni|ver&s;ity of <HI>Oxford,</HI> in con&s;ideration of his merit and learning, added to that of his loyalty, conferred upon him the degree of doctor of phy&s;ic, May 9, 1643.</P>
<P>In the army, he had the rank of lieute|nant colonel to Sir <HI>Marmaduke</HI> RAWDON, governor of <HI>Ba&s;inghou&s;e.</HI> Mr. <HI>Granger</HI> in|forms us, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he &s;et fire to the <HI>Grange,</HI> near that fortre&s;s, which con&s;i&s;ted of twenty hou&s;es, and killed and burnt about three hundred of Sir William <HI>Waller</HI>'s men, wounded five hundred more, and took arms, ammunition, and provi&s;ions from the enemy."</Q> Wood adds, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that going with a party on the 14th of Sep|tember, 1644, to &s;uccour certain of the forces belonging to that hou&s;e, which went to the town of <HI>Ba&s;ing</HI> to fetch pro|vi&s;ions thence, but beaten back by the
<PB N="128" REF="147">
enemy, headed by that notorious rebel, Colonel <HI>Richard Norton,</HI> he received a &s;hot in the &s;houlder, of which he died in a fortnight after. At which time his worth did ju&s;tly challenge funeral tears; being then no le&s;s eminent in the garri|&s;on for his valour and conduct as a &s;ol|dier, than famous through the kingdom for his excellency as an herbali&s;t and phy&s;ician."</Q></P>
<P>I have mentioned John&s;on's <HI>Iter Can|tianum,</HI> and <HI>Ericetum Ham&s;tedianum;</HI> but not having &s;een either, I can give no ac|count of them.</P>
<P>In 1633, he publi&s;hed his improved edi|tion of GERARD, under the title of "The HERBAL, <HI>or</HI> GENERAL HISTORY <HI>of</HI> PLANTS, gathered by <HI>John</HI> GERARD, of <HI>London,</HI> very much enlarged and a|mended by <HI>Thomas</HI> JOHNSON, citizen and apothecary of <HI>London,</HI> for I&s;lip and Nor|ton." 1633. fol.; and again 1636. pp. 1630.</P>
<P>An interval of thirty-&s;ix years, from the date of <HI>Gerard's</HI> work, had effected a great change in the &s;tate of botanical knowledge;
<PB N="129" REF="148">
many new plants had been introduced, and many valuable works publi&s;hed on the con|tinent, particularly the <HI>Hortus Ey&s;tetten|&s;is</HI> in 1613, and the <HI>Prodromus</HI> of Bau|hine in 1620. No publications had ap|peared at home, except &s;uch as were adapted to the Flori&s;t and Gardener; <HI>Ga&s;|par Bauhine</HI>'s invaluable <HI>Pinax</HI> had facili|tated and &s;hortened the labour of con&s;ulting preceding authors. All the&s;e circum&s;tances were favourable to JOHNSON; and his ac|knowledged &s;uperiority to GERARD in the learned languages, might ju&s;tly rai&s;e the ex|pectation of the public; in&s;omuch that it becomes a matter of &s;peculation, why JOHN|SON acquie&s;ced in the character of an editor only. It may indeed be converted into a &s;trong pre&s;umption of the value &s;et by the public on GERARD; which probably pre|vented the ri&s;k of a new title.</P>
<P>The general expectation was not di&s;ap|pointed. The advantages above noted en|abled JOHNSON to amplify and improve his author to &s;uch a degree, that his book eminently de&s;erves the <HI>encomium</HI> that HAL|LER has be&s;towed upon it, when he calls
<PB N="130" REF="149">
it <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>dignum opus, et totius rei herbariae eo aevo notae, compendium.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>After what has been &s;aid of the plan, as it &s;tands in GERARD, it remains only to &s;hew briefly what JOHNSON has done. In about twelve pages, he has prefixed a con|ci&s;e, candid, and judicious account of the mo&s;t material writers on the &s;ubject, from the earlie&s;t ages to the time in which he wrote; concluding with a particular account of his own work, from its origin in Dr. PRIEST's tran&s;lation. After this follows a table, pointing out, with great preci&s;ion, all his additions; by which we learn, that he enriched the work with more than eight hundred plants not in GERARD, and up|wards of &s;even hundred figures, be&s;ides in|numerable corrections. By procuring the &s;ame cuts that GERARD u&s;ed, (to which collection a con&s;iderable acce&s;&s;ion had been made) and by having &s;ome new blocks cut, his work contained a greater number of figures than any Herbal extant; the whole amounting to 2717. He informs us, in an apology he makes for not in&s;erting his additional matter in the edition of 1636,
<PB N="131" REF="150">
that he intended to travel throughout the kingdom in &s;earch of the more rare plants, and afterwards to compri&s;e all his di&s;cove|ries in an appendix.</P>
<P>In 1634, he publi&s;hed "MERCURIUS BOTANICUS; <HI>&s;ive</HI> PLANTARUM <HI>gratia &s;u&s;|cepti Itineris, anno</HI> 1634, DESCRIPTIO; <HI>cum earum Nominibus Latinis et Anglicis.</HI>" <HI>Lond.</HI> 8vo. pp. 78.</P>
<P>It is dedicated to <HI>Sir Theodore</HI> MAYERNE, and others of the college, in his own, and the names of his a&s;&s;ociates in the excur&s;ion, who were all of the company of the Apo|thecaries. It was the re&s;ult of a journey, through <HI>Oxford,</HI> to <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and back by <HI>Southampton,</HI> the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> and <HI>Guildford,</HI> made with the profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign to inve&s;tigate rare plants. He has de&s;cribed, in not inelegant Latin, their rout, which took up only twelve days, and the agree|able reception they met with among their medical acquaintance. We meet with a li&s;t of exotics, amounting to 117, cultivated by Mr. <HI>George</HI> GIBBS, a &s;urgeon at <HI>Bath,</HI> who had made a voyage to <HI>Virginia,</HI> from whence he brought many new plants; which, as it exhibits the advanced &s;tate of
<PB N="132" REF="151">
gardening in this country at that time, is now a matter of curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>The plants of &s;pontaneous growth enu|merated in this &s;hort tour, varieties being excluded. exceed &s;ix hundred, which, at a time when the <HI>cryptogamiae</HI> were &s;carcely noticed, and in the &s;ea&s;on when neither the very early nor late plants could be &s;een, is no incon&s;iderable number. In this ca|talogue are &s;everal not di&s;covered in <HI>Eng|land</HI> before. With this tour JOHNSON gave his &s;mall tract, "<HI>De Thermis Bathonicis, &s;ive earum de&s;criptio, vires, utendi tempus, modus,</HI> &amp;c." Lond. 1634. pp. 19. There are three &s;mall plans of the baths, and one of the city, which &s;eem to be copied from Speed's map. The&s;e are now plea&s;ing curio&s;ities to the lovers of antiquity, and to all who contemplate the a&s;toni&s;hing increa&s;e of the city &s;ince that time.</P>
<P>This was followed by "PARS ALTERA, <HI>&s;ive</HI> PLANTARUM <HI>gratia &s;u&s;cepti Itineris in Cambriam &s;eu Walliam</HI> DESCRIPTIO." Lond. 1641. 8^o.</P>
<P>JOHNSON, if not the fir&s;t, was among the earlie&s;t Botani&s;ts who vi&s;ited <HI>Wales,</HI> and <HI>Snowdon,</HI> with the &s;ole intention of
<PB N="133" REF="152">
di&s;covering the rarities of that country in the vegetable kingdom. The journey &s;eems to have an&s;wered his purpo&s;e, and afford|ed him a rich harve&s;t. In this expedition he fir&s;t found the yellow poppy, <HI>papaver cambricum:</HI> mountain &s;aw-wort, <HI>&s;erratula alpina:</HI> ro&s;e-root, <HI>rhodiola ro&s;ea;</HI> and &s;everal other plants.</P>
<P>I cannot a&s;certain the age of JOHNSON at his death, but there is rea&s;on to think he could not be far advanced in life, if indeed he was arrived at the meridian of it. I ground my opinion on the circum&s;tance of LOBEL's total &s;ilence relating to him, in his <HI>Adver&s;aria,</HI> printed in 1605. En|gaged as JOHNSON was, in the exerci&s;e of a profe&s;&s;ion, which, independent of the calls of duty, demands much &s;acrifice of time, to the forms and civilities of life, his HERBAL is an ample te&s;timony of zeal and indu&s;try. I do not find that he was the author of any other publications, than tho&s;e, of which I have given &s;ome account; but, he tran&s;lated the works of <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI> PAREY, which he publi&s;hed at <HI>London</HI> in 1643. They were reprinted, if I mi&s;take not,
<PB N="134" REF="153">
for the la&s;t time in 1678. This excellent man, who in the character of &s;urgeon, &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively &s;erved four &s;overeigns of <HI>France,</HI> was attached to the prote&s;tant cau&s;e; and for his extraordinary merit, and his having cured <HI>Charles</HI> IX. of a tendon wounded in bleeding, was &s;aved from the ma&s;&s;acre of St. <HI>Bartholomew.</HI> He &s;urvived this event 19 years, and died in 1590. His works were collected by him&s;elf, in 1582, in folio, and ran through nine or ten editions on the continent. PAREY's improvements in his profe&s;&s;ion had been &s;ingularly important; there can be no doubt, therefore, that our author performed a very acceptable &s;ervice to his countrymen, by putting his writings into an Engli&s;h dre&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MILLER con&s;ecrated the name of JOHNSON by a&s;|&s;igning it to a berry-bearing &s;hrub of <HI>Carolina,</HI> belonging to the <HI>tetrandrous</HI> cla&s;s; fir&s;t figured by PLUKENET, <HI>tab.</HI> 136. f. 3. and &s;ince by CATESBY, <HI>vol.</HI> 2. <HI>tab.</HI> 47. The Engli&s;h Botani&s;ts, who mu&s;t con&s;ider JOHNSON as entitled to &s;o honourable a di&s;tinction among their worthies, will regret that his name &s;hould not be re|tained in the Linnaean &s;y&s;tem, in preference to <HI>Callicarpa,</HI> by which term this &s;hrub is now well known in the Engli&s;h gardens.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="154">
Before JOHNSON is di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, it would be unju&s;t not to notice &s;ome of tho&s;e, to whom the author was e&s;pecially indebted for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and for the communication of Engli&s;h plants. Among the&s;e, the fir&s;t place is due to Mr. <HI>John</HI> GOODYER, of <HI>Maple Durham,</HI> in <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> who&s;e name occurs repeatedly in GERARD's "Herbal," and very frequently in PARKINSON's, in which he is &s;tiled <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a great lover and curious &s;earcher of plants; who, be&s;ides this" (&s;peaking of the <HI>geranium &s;axa|tile</HI>) "hath found in our country many other plants, not imagined to grow in our land."</Q> He &s;eems not only to have been what may be called a <HI>practical</HI> Bota|ni&s;t, but learned, and critically ver&s;ed in the hi&s;tory of the &s;cience. This may be fairly inferred from his curious communi|cation, relating to the manu&s;cripts under the name of APULEIUS <HI>Madauren&s;is,</HI> and from his ob&s;ervations on the <HI>&s;axifrage</HI> of the ancients, in&s;erted at p. 604. The great number of rare Engli&s;h plants, which Mr. GOODYER fir&s;t brought to light, entitles

<HEAD>PARKINSON.</HEAD>
<P><HI>JOHN</HI> PARKINSON was born in 1567. I regret that I am not enabled to &s;up|ply a more ample account of this laborious man, who&s;e learning and abilities appear to me not to have been ju&s;tly appreciated. He was bred an apothecary, and lived in <HI>London.</HI> He was contemporary with GE|RARD and LOBEL, during the latter part of their lives; and &s;urvived JOHNSON &s;eve|ral years. LOBEL, in the &s;econd part of his <HI>Adver&s;aria,</HI> and JOHNSON, in his <HI>Gerardus Emaculatus,</HI> &s;peak of him as a man of emi|nence in his profe&s;&s;ion, and as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
<PB N="139" REF="158">
a garden well &s;tored with rarities. In fact, he ro&s;e to &s;uch a degree of reputation as to be appointed apothecary to King <HI>James;</HI> and at the publication of his "Theatre of Plants," he obtained, as we learn by Sir <HI>Theodore</HI> MAYERNE's commendatory letter prefixed to it, the title from <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t of <HI>Botanicus Regius Primarius.</HI> The time of his death I cannot a&s;certain; but, as his "Herbal" was publi&s;hed in 1640, and he appears to be living at that time, he mu&s;t have attained his 73d year. There is a print of him prefixed to his <HI>Paradi&s;us,</HI> in the 62d year of his age, and a &s;mall oval one, in the title of his "Herbal," or "Theatre of Plants."</P>
<P>His fir&s;t publication was the "PARA|DISI IN SOLE PARADISUS TERRESTRIS; or, a garden of all &s;orts of plea&s;ant flowers, which our Engli&s;h ayre will permit to be nur&s;ed up: with a kitchen garden of all manner of herbs, roots, and fruits, for meat or &s;au&s;e, u&s;ed with us, and an or|chard of all &s;orte of fruit-bearing trees and &s;hrubbes fit for our land; together with the right ordering, planting, and pre&s;erv|ing
<PB N="140" REF="159">
of them, and their u&s;es and vertues. Collected by <HI>John</HI> PARKINSON, apothe|cary of London 1629." Folio. pp. 612.</P>
<P>There was a &s;econd edition publi&s;hed after the author's death, corrected and en|larged, in 1656.</P>
<P>As the &s;ubject of this book intere&s;ts the flori&s;t and gardener merely, it comes le&s;s within the &s;cope of this work than his "Herbal." It is dedicated to Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> and, agreeably to the panegyri|cal cu&s;tom of the times, is &s;et off with re|commendatory ver&s;es; among which we meet with &s;ome in Latin from <HI>Thomas</HI> JOHNSON, doubtle&s;s the editor of GERARD, and a Latin letter, in a high &s;train of eu|logy, from Sir <HI>Theodore</HI> MAYERNE.</P>
<P>The plants are arranged without any other order than that expre&s;&s;ed in the title page. Garden flowers are divided into 134 chapters, according to the generical names of the time; kitchen plants into 63 chapters; fruit trees and &s;hrubs into 24 chapters; and a corollary of 22 &s;pecies. Nearly one thou&s;and plants are &s;eparately de&s;cribed; of which &s;even hundred and eighty are figur|ed
<PB N="141" REF="160">
on one hundred and nine tables, which appear to have been cut on purpo&s;e for this work. Many are copied from CLUSIUS and LOBEL. The figures are le&s;s com|mendable for the de&s;ign than the execution, and are much inferior, on the whole, to tho&s;e of GERARD's "Herbal." In the Latin names, the author has made u&s;e prin|cipally of <HI>Ca&s;per</HI> BAUHINE; &s;ome are taken from LOBEL. The mode of arrange|ment in each chapter is &s;imilar to that of GERARD. After the de&s;cription of all the &s;pecies, follow the place, time of flowering, &s;ynonyms, and virtues. Le&s;s is &s;poken of the culture than &s;eems to be requi&s;ite.</P>
<P>Several Engli&s;hmen had written on gar|dening and agriculture in the &s;ixteenth century, of whom the fir&s;t on hu&s;bandry, as far as I can find, was <HI>Antony</HI> FITZHER|BERT, a famous lawyer and ju&s;tice of the King's Bench, who&s;e "Booke of Hu&s;|bandrie" was printed fir&s;t in 1534. One of the earlie&s;t, if not the fir&s;t on gardening, is <HI>Thomas</HI> HILL, "His profytable Art of Gardening," printed in 1574. The next was, "The new Orchard and Garden," by
<PB N="142" REF="161">
William LAWSON, in 1597. In 1600, Sir <HI>Hugh</HI> PLATT, the author of many other u&s;eful tracts, put forth his "Garden of Eden;" a book of great merit in its time. All the&s;e pa&s;&s;ed through numerous editions, and the la&s;t pre&s;erved credit to the end of the century.</P>
<P>PARKINSON however, as I apprehend, was the fir&s;t author, who &s;eparately de&s;crib|ed and figured the &s;ubjects of the <HI>Flower Garden.</HI> The <HI>Paradi&s;us Terre&s;tris</HI> is there|fore, at this time, a valuable curio&s;ity, as exhibiting the mo&s;t compleat view of the extent of the Engli&s;h garden at the begin|ning of the la&s;t century. Intertropical productions had been but &s;paringly import|ed. The real &s;tove plants are very rare throughout the book. There are &s;ome American &s;pecies, and particularly from <HI>Virginia,</HI> as being a part of that continent with which <HI>England</HI> had the mo&s;t frequent intercour&s;e. But the principal productions of the Engli&s;h gardens were exotic Euro|pean, and Grecian plants, &s;ome A&s;iatic, and a few from the northern coa&s;ts of <HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P>A modern flori&s;t, wholly unacquainted
<PB N="143" REF="162">
with the &s;tate of the art at the time PAR|KINSON wrote, would perhaps be &s;urprized to find that his predece&s;&s;ors could enume|rate, be&s;ides &s;ixteen de&s;cribed as di&s;tinct &s;pecies, one hundred and twenty varieties of the <HI>tulip,</HI> &s;ixty <HI>anemonies,</HI> more than nine|ty of the <HI>narci&s;&s;us</HI> tribe, fifty <HI>hyacinths,</HI> fifty <HI>carnations,</HI> twenty <HI>pinks,</HI> thirty <HI>cro|cu&s;es,</HI> and above forty of the <HI>iris</HI> genus. In the orchard we find above &s;ixty kinds of <HI>plums,</HI> as many <HI>apples</HI> and <HI>pears,</HI> thirty <HI>cherries,</HI> and more than twenty <HI>peaches.</HI></P>
<P>In 1640, PARKINSON publi&s;hed his "THEATRUM BOTANICUM; or, Theatre of Plants, or an Herbal of a large extent: containing therein a more ample and ex|act hi&s;tory and declaration of the phy&s;ical herbs and plants that are in other au|thors; encrea&s;ed by the acce&s;s of many hundreds of new, rare, and &s;trange plants from all the parts of the world; with &s;undry gummes, and other phy&s;ical materials, than hath been hitherto pub|li&s;hed by any before: and a mo&s;t large demon&s;tration of their nature and virtues. Shewing withal, the many errors, differ|ences,
<PB N="144" REF="163" MS="y">
and over&s;ights of &s;undry authors that have formerly written of them, and a certain confidence, or mo&s;t probable conjecture of the true and genuine herbs and plants: di&s;tributed into &s;undry cla&s;&s;es or tribes, for the more ea&s;y knowledge of the many herbs of one nature and property, with the chief notes of Dr. <HI>Lobel,</HI> Dr. <HI>Bonham,</HI> and others, in&s;erted therein." London. Folio. pp. 1746. SEGUIER mentions and edition in 1656, which I never &s;aw, and &s;u&s;pect it was not a new impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>This work was the labour of PARKIN|SON's life, and was not publi&s;hed until he was arrived at a very advanced period. He tells us, in the preface, that, owing <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to the di&s;|a&s;trous times,"</Q> and other impediments, the printing of it was long retarded. Ori|ginally it was intended to have contained only the medicinal herbs, under the title of "A phy&s;ical Garden of Simples," but he enlarged his plan, and endeavoured to comprehend all the Botany of his time. It is manife&s;t, even from a cur&s;ory view of it, that it is a work of much more originality
<PB N="145" REF="164">
than that of GERARD; and it contains abundantly more matter than the la&s;t edi|tion of that author, with all JOHNSON's augmentations. In the general di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;ubject, the order is chiefly founded on the known, or &s;uppo&s;ed qualities, and virtues of the plants; being divided into &s;eventeen tribes, as follow:<LIST>

<P>This heterogeneous cla&s;&s;ification, which &s;eems to be founded on that of <HI>Dodoens,</HI> &s;ometimes on the medicinal qualities, &s;ome|times on the habit, and on the place of growth, &s;hews the &s;mall advances that had been made towards any truly &s;cientific di&s;|tribution. On the contrary, both GE|RARD, JOHNSON, and PARKINSON, had rather gone back, by not &s;ufficiently pur&s;u|ing the example of LOBEL.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="166">
In the particular di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;ub|jects, under each chapter or genus, PAR|KINSON follows the rules of GERARD, and JOHNSON, by giving, after the Latin and Engli&s;h name, the de&s;criptions at large; then the place of growth, and time of flowering; the &s;ynonyms, and la&s;tly, the virtues and u&s;es.</P>
<P>Nice di&s;crimination of &s;pecies from each other, or from varieties, mu&s;t not be ex|pected in this work, more than in GE|RARD, or his <HI>Emaculator.</HI> Almo&s;t every Botani&s;t was then a Flori&s;t too. CLUSIUS him&s;elf, who had enlarged the &s;cience, by his own di&s;coveries, beyond any other man, continued to rai&s;e tulips from &s;eed, for more than 35 years. PARKINSON's "<HI>Paradi&s;us</HI>" proves his attachment to the Flower Gar|den, in the early part of his life; and this bias influenced him throughout the "Thea|tre of Plants." As yet, no line had been drawn with &s;ufficient accuracy, between &s;pecies and variety, between nature and the effect of culture, or of &s;oil and &s;ituation, nor was this brought about till the e&s;&s;ential parts of vegetables, the flower, and the fruit, became
<PB N="148" REF="167">
objects of cla&s;&s;ification, in&s;tead of the vague di&s;tinctions hitherto ob&s;erved; of which it may be &s;ufficient to adduce one example, out of hundreds equally futile. The &s;ea cabbage, <HI>(bra&s;&s;ica orientalis)</HI> a <HI>&s;iliquo&s;e</HI> plant, is ranked by GERARD and JOHNSON, as well as by PARKINSON, even contrary to the examples of CLUSIUS and DODONAEUS, under the &s;ame generical name with the thorow wax, <HI>(bupleurum)</HI> an <HI>umbelliferous</HI> plant, merely becau&s;e the leaf is of the <HI>per&s;oliate</HI> kind.</P>
<P>The&s;e are defects common to the age, and PARKINSON mu&s;t not be appreciated by modern improvement, but by compari&s;on with his contemporaries. In this view, if I am not mi&s;taken, he will appear more of an original author than GERARD, or JOHNSON, independent of the advantages he might derive from being po&s;terior to them. His "<HI>Theatre</HI>" was carried on thro' a long &s;eries of years, and he profited by the works of &s;ome late authors, which, though equal|ly in JOHNSON's power, he had neglected to u&s;e. PARKINSON's de&s;criptions, in many in&s;tances, appear to be new. He is
<PB N="149" REF="168">
more particular in pointing out the places of growth. In the enumeration of the &s;ynonyms, he has not only given nearly the whole of BAUHINE's "<HI>Pinax,</HI>" but, very fre|quently, has him&s;elf con&s;ulted the original authors, and enters minutely into a di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion of their doubts. In the account of the virtues, and u&s;es, PARKINSON is diffu&s;e. It was his profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign to make his work a <HI>Materia Medica;</HI> and if, in him, we meet with the qualities of plants e&s;timated on Galenical principles, by the degrees of hot and cold, moi&s;t and dry, &amp;c. it was the theory o&s; the day, from which authors of higher eminence were not emancipated. He not only gives the opinions of the Greek and Roman phy&s;icians, but of the Arabi|ans, and has tran&s;lated from the moderns, and his contemporaries, whatever could il|lu&s;trate his &s;ubject, and render it as perfect as the intelligence of the times would al|low. To this end he has extracted largely from CLUSIUS's "Exotics," from D'A|COSTA, MONARDES, and GARCIAS <HI>ab</HI> HORTO on the drugs and &s;imples of the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies; of which, at that
<PB N="150" REF="169">
time, many were newly introduced, and imperfectly known.</P>
<P>PARKINSON's work is much more ex|ten&s;ive than JOHNSON's, in the number of &s;ubjects de&s;cribed, he having taken, as be|fore ob&s;erved, advantages which the <HI>Ema|culator</HI> of GERARD neglected. Many of the plants of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> from <HI>Pro&s;per</HI> ALPI|NUS, many of the North American, or Ca|nadian plants, from CORNUTUS, and &s;ome from COLUMNA's work, are introduced. He neglected no opportunities of procuring new plants from abroad. The nature of his profe&s;&s;ion did not allow him to make di&s;tant or frequent excur&s;ions in <HI>England;</HI> but, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his corre&s;pondents, and &s;ome of LOBEL's po&s;thumous writings, which he purcha&s;ed, he was enabled to en|large, not only the catalogue of Briti&s;h plants, but to introduce many exotics be|fore unknown.</P>
<P>JOHNSON had de&s;cribed about 2850 plants, PARKINSON has near 3800. The&s;e accumulations rendered the "THEA|TRUM BOTANICUM" the mo&s;t copious book on the &s;ubject in the Engli&s;h lan|guage;
<PB N="151" REF="170">
and it may be pre&s;umed, that it gained equally the approbation of medical people, and of all tho&s;e who were curious and inqui&s;itive in this kind of knowledge. Both this work, and GERARD's afterwards, acquired con&s;equence by the references of Mr. RAY, who may be &s;aid, in the lan|guage of the <HI>Catalogus Oxonien&s;is,</HI> to have rai&s;ed them to cla&s;&s;ical eminence in En|gli&s;h Botany, and pre&s;erved them from ob|livion as long as his own works remain. Without any de&s;ign of depriving JOHNSON of his due prai&s;e, yet it is obvious, from the recollection of certain circum&s;tances, that PARKINSON laboured under di&s;advan|tages and impediments, which probably tended to depre&s;s his work at the time, al|though it had undoubtedly been carrying on through a longer &s;eries of years than <HI>John|&s;on</HI>'s, and was more copious in its de&s;ign.</P>
<P>JOHNSON had the opportunity that GE|RARD him&s;elf obtained, of procuring all the cuts from abroad. PARKINSON's, on the other hand, though copied from the &s;ame figures, appear to have been cut anew, purpo&s;ely for his work. The delay occa|&s;ioned
<PB N="152" REF="171">
by this circum&s;tance, be&s;ides the great expence, was, probably, among the ob&s;tacles the author complains of, which &s;o long retarded the publication of his work. Add to this, that the figures were after all inferior to the old tables, both in number and execution. JOHNSON's exceed tho&s;e of PARKINSON, by more than an hundred. Both the&s;e works may be con&s;idered as <HI>Di|ge&s;ts</HI> of the Botany of the age, in the Eng|li&s;h tongue; but it is to be feared the &s;ame cen&s;ure lies again&s;t them which <HI>Ca&s;par</HI> BAUHINE lodged again&s;t DALECHAMP's hi&s;tory, publi&s;hed in 1588, in which he de|mon&s;trated, that more than 400 plants were twice de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Nor is it wonderful that the attempt to comprehend, and di&s;criminate the whole vegetable kingdom, was a plan too exten|&s;ive for one man, e&s;pecially in the aug|mented &s;tate in which PARKINSON found it. The magnitude of the de&s;ign nece&s;|&s;arily involved a multitude of errors, and expo&s;ed both GERARD and PARKINSON to the cen&s;ures of malignant critics. Had the candour of LOBEL been equal to his
<PB N="153" REF="172">
learning and knowledge, he had &s;pared much of his acrimony again&s;t the&s;e indu&s;|trious writers, who&s;e laudable endeavours rather merited his applau&s;e.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e contemporaries, who&s;e col|lateral a&s;&s;i&s;tance is acknowledged by PAR|KINSON, Mr. (or, as he is &s;tiled in &s;ome parts of the work, <HI>Dr.</HI>) <HI>William</HI> BOEL claims particular notice. He was a native of the Low Countries, and had travelled into various parts of <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Spain;</HI> had been in <HI>Barbary,</HI> re&s;ided at <HI>Tunis,</HI> and, at the publication of "the Herbal," lived at <HI>Li&s;bon.</HI> From all the&s;e countries he &s;ent &s;eeds of many plants before unknown in <HI>England.</HI> He was the corre&s;pondent of CLUSIUS, and &s;eems to have been very zealous for the improvement of natural knowledge.</P>

<HEAD>WOODEN CUTS.</HEAD>
<P>AS we are now arrived at the period, when wooden cuts were about to be &s;uper&s;eded by engravings on metal, PAR|KINSON's "Herbal" being the la&s;t of any importance in which they were u&s;ed in <HI>England,</HI> it may not be incongruous to our plan to notice the origin and progre&s;s of that art, which contributed not a little to facilitate the knowledge of plants. Rude as the&s;e repre&s;entations were, compared with the elegance of modern times, yet, in an age when &s;pecific di&s;tinctions were not fixed, and the diagno&s;tic of the plant de|pended
<PB N="156" REF="175">
&s;o much on habit, they &s;poke to the eye, and often di&s;criminated the &s;ubject, when the laboured de&s;cription failed.</P>
<P>It has been before ob&s;erved, that SE|GUIER is of opinion the fir&s;t Herbal with wooden cuts was the "<HI>Buch der Natur,</HI>" "The Book of Nature," printed at <HI>Aug&s;|burgh,</HI> in 1478, if not three years earlier. The&s;e are thought to have pa&s;&s;ed into the HERBARIUS, printed at <HI>Mentz</HI> in 1484; from which book was compiled the ORTUS SANITATIS, printed at the &s;ame place in 1485; with improvements in the work in general, and better figures, by CUBA. Of this work &s;ome notice has before been taken, as the foundation of the Engli&s;h "Grete Herbal," fir&s;t printed here in 1516.</P>
<P>The HORTUS SANITATIS was tran&s;lated into various languages, and in &s;ome new|modelled, without concealing its origin, according to the fancy of different editors and printers; and pa&s;&s;ed through innume|rable editions on the Continent; having been the popular book on the &s;ubject, as the "<HI>Grete Herbal</HI>" was in England, for fi&s;ty or &s;ixty years.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="176">
It does not appear that CUBA was pub|licly known as the author of the HORTUS SANITATIS, until EGENOLF, a book&s;eller of <HI>Frankfort,</HI> gave an improved edition, with an entirely new &s;et of figures, under the care of EUCHARIUS RHODION or RO|ESLIN, a phy&s;ician of the &s;ame city, in 1533. <HI>Egenolf</HI>'s book pa&s;&s;ed through va|rious editions, until a better work was com|po&s;ed by DORSTEN, under the title of "<HI>Bo|tanicon,</HI>" in 1540, at <HI>Frankfort;</HI> in which the &s;ame figures were employed. They were u&s;ed al&s;o in the "<HI>Encyclopaedia Medica</HI>" of J. DRYANDER, in 1542; and in the &s;ucceeding year, in an edition of DIOSCO|RIDES, by <HI>Hermann Ryff,</HI> printed by <HI>Ege|nolf.</HI> Finally, ADAM LONICER, the &s;on-in-law of <HI>Egenolf,</HI> having totally reformed the work of CUBA, employed them in his <HI>Herbal,</HI> printed in 1546. In &s;ucceeding editions, he introduced new figures, took others from TRAGUS to the number in the whole of 880, and compo&s;ed a work, which pa&s;&s;ed through a great number of editions, and was not &s;uper&s;eded in the pre&s;ent century, as appears by an edition
<PB N="158" REF="177">
printed &s;o lately as in 1723, and even in 1737.</P>
<P>We are informed by TRAGUS, that <HI>Ege|nolf</HI> &s;pared no expence in the encourage|ment of arti&s;ts to procure the&s;e icons, rude and imperfect as they appear to us. He &s;e|cured to him&s;elf, by this means, the mo|nopoly of printing <HI>Herbals,</HI> for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of years; and acquired both fame and riches.</P>
<P>At length, the&s;e were all &s;uper&s;eded by tho&s;e of BRUNSFELSIUS to his Herbal, printed in 1532; which were drawn from nature, and appear to have been the fir&s;t that were worthy of notice. The&s;e were, however, greatly excelled by FUCHSIUS, in 1542; who&s;e figures, although only out|lines, are uncommonly beautiful, and not le&s;s ju&s;t. They con&s;i&s;t of five hundred figures in folio, of the mo&s;t common and u&s;eful plants; and were copied, in a &s;maller &s;cale, by many &s;ucceeding authors. TRA|GUS took mo&s;t of them into his "Hi&s;tory of German Plants," to which he added many new ones, to the amount in all of 567. Tho&s;e of TRAGUS are little more
<PB N="159" REF="178">
than outlines; and, allowing for the time, they &s;ufficiently well expre&s;s the habit of mo&s;t of the &s;ubjects.</P>
<P><HI>Egenolf</HI> having &s;et the example, printers, after this time, them&s;elves bore the expence of cutting the blocks; by which means, certain printers monopoli&s;ed the printing of <HI>Herbals;</HI> and a kind of commerce between them and authors took place, and mutual exchanges were made for the u&s;e of each other's books. Among the&s;e, no one po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed at length a greater collection than the famous PLANTIN, of <HI>Antwerp;</HI> who recommended him&s;elf &s;o highly by the excellency of his types, and mode of exe|cuting his works. Hence he became the common printer to &s;everal of the celebrated botanic writers of the &s;ixteenth century. When CLUSIUS publi&s;hed his French tran&s;|lation of DODOENS, with <HI>Loe,</HI> at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> he gave figures copied from FUCHSIUS; all which <HI>Plantin</HI> bought. He afterwards acquired the figures cut for CLUSIUS's own works, and tho&s;e of LOBEL. DODONAEUS, be&s;ides &s;ome new blocks, had the u&s;e of all the above in the "<HI>Pemptades,</HI>" in 1584, which work contains 1300 figures. TABERNAE|MONTANUS
<PB N="160" REF="179">
obtained the u&s;e of this col|lection, namely, tho&s;e of FUCHSIUS, CLU|SIUS, LOBEL, and DODONAEUS; to which he added tho&s;e of MATTHIOLUS; in&s;o|much that his Herbal, printed at <HI>Frankfort</HI> in 1588, comprehends more than two thou|&s;and figures. DALECHAMP, in his "Ge|neral Hi&s;tory of Plants," printed about the &s;ame time, augmented them to near two thou&s;and &s;even hundred.</P>
<P>The fate of GESNER's excellent figures I can but briefly mention; it forms a mor|tifying, but curious anecdote, in the literary hi&s;tory of the &s;cience. Of the fifteen hun|dred figures left by GESNER, prepared for his "Hi&s;tory of Plants," at his death, in 1565, a large &s;hare pa&s;&s;ed into the "<HI>Epi|tome Matthioli,</HI>" publi&s;hed by CAMERA|RIUS in 1586, which contained in the whole 1003 figures; and in the &s;ame year, as al&s;o into a &s;econd edition in 1590, they embel|li&s;hed an abridged tran&s;lation of MAT|THIOLUS, printed under the name of the "German Herbal." In 1609, the &s;ame blocks were u&s;ed by <HI>Uffenbach</HI> for the Her|bal of CASTOR DURANTES, printed at <HI>Frankfort.</HI> This publication, however,
<PB N="161" REF="180">
comprehends only 948 of the&s;e icons, nearly another hundred being introduced of very in|ferior merit. After this period, CAMERA|RIUS the younger being dead, the&s;e blocks were purcha&s;ed by <HI>Goerlin,</HI> a book&s;eller of <HI>Ulm;</HI> and next &s;erved for the "<HI>Parna&s;&s;us Medicinalis illu&s;tratus</HI>" of BECHER, printed at that city in 1663; the &s;econd part of which work contains all tho&s;e of the "<HI>Epi|tome,</HI>" except &s;ix figures. In 1678, they were taken into a German Herbal, made up from MATTHIOLUS, by <HI>Bernard</HI> VER|ZASCHA, printed at <HI>Ba&s;il;</HI> and &s;uch was the excellency of the materials and work|man&s;hip of the&s;e blocks, that they were exhibited a &s;ixth time in the "<HI>Theatrum Botanicum,</HI>" or Kr&auml;uterbuch of ZWINGER, being an amended edition of VERZASCHA, printed al&s;o at <HI>Ba&s;il</HI> in 1696, with the addi|tion of more than one hundred new blocks, copied from C. BAUHINE and TABERNAE|MONTANUS; and finally, into a new edition of the &s;ame work, &s;o late as the year 1744.</P>
<P>Thus did the genius and labours of GES|NER add dignity and ornament to the works of other men, and even of &s;ome who&s;e en|mity he had experienced during his life-time.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="181">
Be&s;ides the above mentioned, GESNER left five volumes, con&s;i&s;ting entirely of figures, which, after various vici&s;&s;itudes, became the property of TREW, of <HI>Norim|berg.</HI> Sen&s;ible that whether we view the extent of GESNER's knowledge and learn|ing, or his &s;ingular indu&s;try, &s;uch mu&s;t be the veneration for his character, that any of his remains mu&s;t claim the attention of the curious, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or gratified the pub|lic, by the pen of Dr. SCHMIEDEL, with an ample &s;pecimen, publi&s;hed in 1753.</P>
<P>Thus far for foreigners. The rude icons of the "Grete Herbal," it has been ob|&s;erved, were evidently copied from tho&s;e in the HORTUS SANITATIS; for that they were not the &s;ame tables, appears from the dimini&s;hed &s;ize. Of the figures in TURNER's Hi&s;tory, which amount to upwards of 500; the greater part are tho&s;e of FUCHSIUS's octavo &s;et; and the remainder, nearly 100, were new. LYTE printed his tran&s;lation of DODOENS with <HI>Loe,</HI> at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> for the conveniency of his figures, which are al&s;o borrowed from FUCHSIUS; to which LYTE added about thirty new ones.</P>
<P>GERARD, in 1597, and JOHNSON, his
<PB N="163" REF="182">
"<HI>Emaculator</HI>" afterwards, in 1633 and 1636, procured all the blocks from <HI>Frank|fort,</HI> with which the Herbal of TABERNAE|MONTANUS had been illu&s;trated. JOHN|SON by this means accumulated upwards of 2700 cuts.</P>
<P>The blocks for PARKINSON's "<HI>Thea|trum,</HI>" and his "<HI>Paradi&s;us,</HI>" were, I appre|hend, cut in <HI>England;</HI> and tho&s;e for the fir&s;t &s;eem to be copies from GERARD, though much inferior in execution. The la&s;t of the kind u&s;ed in <HI>England,</HI> were a new &s;et cut for SALMON's "Herbal," in 1710; except, I believe, tho&s;e for a very indifferent per|formance, under the name of "An Herbal," publi&s;hed &s;ince that time, in quarto.</P>
<P>The earlie&s;t copper-plates of plants on the Continent, are &s;aid to be tho&s;e of <HI>Co|lumna</HI> in his "<HI>Phytoba&s;anos,</HI>" in 1592. In <HI>England,</HI> except &s;ome &s;ingle figures, and the few plates in the fir&s;t edition of PLOT's "Oxford&s;hire" in 1677, tho&s;e of the "<HI>Hi&s;|toria Oxonien&s;is</HI>" are the fir&s;t exhibition of any great work; and of the&s;e, the gra&s;&s;es are, to this time, perhaps unparalleled in the neatne&s;s and accuracy of the execution.</P>

<P>HITHERTO Botany, however &s;uc|ce&s;sfully it might have been culti|vated by individuals in <HI>England,</HI> had re|ceived no encouragement from any public in&s;titutions; but the time was now ar|rived, when it acquired additional vigour and improvement from the foundation of a phy&s;ic-garden at <HI>Oxford.</HI> The&s;e elegant and nece&s;&s;ary aids to &s;cience had con&s;idera|bly multiplied &s;ince the fir&s;t foundations of
<PB N="165" REF="184">
the kind, before noticed, in <HI>Italy</HI> and el&s;e|where. Several univer&s;ities in the more northern and we&s;tern parts of <HI>Europe</HI> had procured the e&s;tabli&s;hment of gardens: <HI>Pa|ris,</HI> in 1570; <HI>Leyden,</HI> in 1577; <HI>Leip&s;ic,</HI> in 1580; <HI>Montpelier,</HI> in 1598; <HI>Jena,</HI> in 1628; and <HI>Oxford,</HI> in the year 1632. This la&s;t was owing to the munificence of HENRY <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Danby,</HI> who gave for this purpo&s;e five acres of ground, built green-hou&s;es and &s;toves, and an hou&s;e for the accommodation of the gardener; endowed the e&s;tabli&s;hment, and placed in it, as the &s;upervi&s;or, <HI>Jacob</HI> BOBART, a German from <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> who lived, as WOOD tells us, in the garden|hou&s;e, and died there on February 4, 1679. A li&s;t of the plants was publi&s;hed, under the title of "CATALOGUS PLANTARUM <HI>Horti medici</HI> OXONIENSIS <HI>Latino-anglicus et Anglico-latinus: alphabetico ordine.</HI>" Oxon. 1648. 12^o. pp. 54 and 51. DILLENIUS informs us, that BOBART drew up this catalogue. In the preface we are told the garden contained 1600 &s;pecies, by which mu&s;t be under&s;tood both exotic and indi|genous, including varieties of each. The
<PB N="166" REF="185">
plants are barely enumerated, without any &s;ynonyms, or references to any author. The number of Engli&s;h &s;pecies recited, extends to 600, or nearly. The copiou&s;ne&s;s of this catalogue &s;ets the zeal and diligence of BOBART in a favourable light. Under his care, and that of his &s;on, the garden of <HI>Oxford</HI> continued to flouri&s;h for many years.</P>
<P>The CATALOGUS OXONIENSIS was re|publi&s;hed in the year 1658, in a much im|proved &s;tate, by the joint a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Dr. STEPHENS, Mr. <HI>William</HI> BROWNE, and the two BOBARTS, father and &s;on, under the following title, "CATALOGUS HORTI BOTANICI OXONIENSIS, <HI>alphabetice dige&s;|tus, duas praeterpropter, plantarum chilia|das complectens, priore duplo auctior, idemque elimatior, nec non etymologiis, qua Graecis, qua Latinis, hinc inde petitis, enucleatior: in quo nomina Latina pariter et Graeca vernaculis; et in ejus &s;equiore parte, vernacula Latinis praeponuntur.

<P>Of Dr. <HI>Philip</HI> STEPHENS, who&s;e name &s;tands fir&s;t among the authors of this cata|logue, we find little mention el&s;ewhere, as eminent in botanical &s;cience.

<P>MERRET, without any notice of Dr. STEPHENS, expre&s;sly calls Mr. BROWNE the author of this <HI>Catalogue;</HI> and <HI>Wood</HI> &s;ays, that he had the chief hand in it. <HI>William</HI> BROWNE was a native of <HI>Ox&s;ord,</HI> became Bachelor of Divinity, and Senior Fellow of Magdalen College. He died in March 1678, aged about 50, and was bu|ried in the outer chapel of his college.</P>
<P>In this enlarged edition, the authors have, in every in&s;tance where it was po&s;&s;ible, not only adopted the &s;pecifical appellations giv|en by GERARD and PARKINSON to each
<PB N="168" REF="187">
plant, but quoted the page of their works. This is the fir&s;t book, as far as I know, on the &s;ubject, printed in <HI>England,</HI> in which the latter of the&s;e circum&s;tances takes place. It is remarkable, that &s;o obvious an a&s;&s;i&s;tance, after having been introduced by <HI>Ca&s;par</HI> BAU|HINE in his "<HI>Phytopinax,</HI>" &s;hould be want|ing in the "<HI>Pinax</HI>" it&s;elf. Had GERARD and PARKINSON retained, throughout their works, the exact &s;ynonyms of the authors from whom they transferred their plants, and quoted the pages, they would unque&s;tionably have rendered their writings much more u&s;eful to po&s;terity, and have pre&s;erved them from di&s;u&s;e and oblivion, for a much longer period. The &s;ame may be ob&s;erved of Mr. RAY, who has totally neglected this valu|able improvement. So novel was the prac|tice, that the authors of the HORTUS OXO|NIENSIS thought it nece&s;&s;ary to apologi&s;e for it, and &s;hield them&s;elves under the au|thority of the "<HI>Hortus Ey&s;tetten&s;is.</HI>"</P>
<P>There are many dubious and ill-a&s;cer|tained plants in this Catalogue; and tho&s;e marked as new, are almo&s;t wholly varieties. Engli&s;h Botany &s;eems to have received little

<HEAD>HOW.</HEAD>
<P>Until this period, no attempts had been made in <HI>England</HI> to &s;eparate the indigenous from exotic botany. It is true, Dr. JOHN|SON, as before mentioned, had publi&s;hed local catalogues of the plants of certain di&s;|tricts; but no one had e&s;&s;ayed a general li&s;t or de&s;cription of the Engli&s;h plants alone, in the way of what is now called a <HI>Flora:</HI> a term, which, as far as I can find, was fir&s;t adopted by <HI>Simon</HI> PAULI, for a catalogue of the plants of <HI>Denmark,</HI> publi&s;hed in 1648. It is to Dr. How that we owe the fir&s;t &s;ketch of a work of this kind; and, though he does not entitle his book <HI>Flora,</HI> he yet mentions that term in his preface.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> How was born in <HI>London</HI> in the year 1619, and educated at Merchant Tay|lors &s;chool. He became a commoner of St. John's college, <HI>Oxford,</HI> at eighteen: he
<PB N="170" REF="189">
took his bachelor's degree in 1641, and that of ma&s;ter of arts in 1645; and entered on the phy&s;ical line. It does not appear that he ever took his doctor's degree, though he was commonly called Dr. How. With many other &s;cholars of that time, he en|tered into the king's army, and for his loy|alty was promoted to the rank of captain, in a troop of hor&s;e. Upon the decline of the royal cau&s;e, he pro&s;ecuted his &s;tudies in phy&s;ic, and practi&s;ed in that faculty. He lived fir&s;t in St. Lawrence Lane, and after|wards in Milk Street. He died about the beginning of September 1656, and was bu|ried by the grave of his mother, in St. Mar|garet's church, <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter;</HI> leaving behind him, as Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"a choice library of books of his faculty, and the character of a noted herbali&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. How's principal publication, and for which he is here recorded, bears the following title:</P>
<P>"PHYTOLOGIA BRITANNICA, <HI>natales exhibens indigenarum Stirpium &s;ponte emer|gentium.</HI>" Lond. 1650. 12^o. pp. 133.</P>
<P>The plants are arranged in the alphabe|tical order of the <HI>Latin</HI> names, with one or
<PB N="171" REF="190">
two &s;ynonyms, taken, as be&s;t plea&s;ed the author, from various writers on the conti|nent, as well as from GERARD, PARKIN|SON, and LOBEL. The place of growth to each plant is noticed, and the particular &s;pots where the rare ones grow, are &s;pecified. The li&s;t contains 1220 plants, which (as few mo&s;&s;es and fungi are enumerated) is a copious catalogue for that time, even ad|mitting the varieties, which the pre&s;ent &s;tate of botany would reject.</P>
<P>The author of this little volume was unque&s;tionably a man of very con&s;iderable learning, and had a &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion for the knowledge of plants; but his &s;ituation in life does not &s;eem to have allowed him the opportunity of travelling into the various parts of <HI>England,</HI> to gratify his ta&s;te in <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> botany, with which he was not criti|cally and exten&s;ively acquainted. Mr. RAY, in the preface to his "<HI>Catalogus Plantarum Angliae,</HI>" has given a li&s;t of more than thirty &s;pecies in the "<HI>Phytologia,</HI>" which have no title to a place as indigenous plants of <HI>Eng|land.</HI> Some of the&s;e being inhabitants of
<PB N="172" REF="191">
Southern Europe; others evidently the ac|cidental outca&s;ts of gardens; and &s;ome, as certainly, mi&s;taken for other plants, as ap|peared from the impo&s;&s;ibility of finding them in the &s;pots which How had pointed out.</P>
<P>The rare plants were almo&s;t wholly com|municated by his friends, Mr. STONE|HOUSE, Dr. BOWLES, Mr. HEATON, Mr. LOGGINS, Mr. GOODYER, and others. He drew &s;ome from a manu&s;cript of Dr. JOHNSON, the editor of GERARD. I wi&s;h it were in my power to commemorate the&s;e per&s;ons in a more ample manner, who, at an early period, contributed to extend and illu&s;trate Engli&s;h botany. Mr. STONE|HOUSE, in particular, has de&s;erved highly of the lovers of this &s;cience. He appears to have travelled much in <HI>England,</HI> from his recording the plants di&s;covered by him in many counties. In <HI>York&s;hire</HI> he was particularly conver&s;ant; and, I conjecture, he lived at a place called <HI>Darfield,</HI> near <HI>Barn&s;ley,</HI> in that county.</P>
<P>Dr. BOWLES, and Mr. GOODYER, are, I believe, the &s;ame per&s;ons mentioned under
<PB N="173" REF="192">
the article of JOHNSON. Of Mr. HEA|TON, I &s;hall take further notice in the &s;e|quel of the&s;e anecdotes.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved, that &s;ome of LO|BEL's papers fell into the hands of PAR|KINSON, and &s;ome into Dr. How's po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion. The&s;e were the fragment of LOBEL's great work, which How publi&s;hed in 1655, under the &s;ub&s;equent title:</P>
<P>"<HI>Matthiae de</HI> LOBEL, <HI>M.D. botanographi regii eximii,</HI> STIRPIUM ILLUSTRATIONES, <HI>plurimas elaborantes inauditas plantas &s;ub|reptitiis Joh.</HI> PARKINSONI <HI>rap&s;odiis (ex co|dice M.S. in&s;alutato) &s;par&s;im gravatae, eju&s;|dem adjecta &s;unt ad calcem Theatri Botanici</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">. <HI>Accurante Guil.</HI> How, <HI>Anglo.</HI>" Lond. 1655. 4^o. pp. 170.</P>
<P>This work has been noticed under the article of LOBEL. It is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve here, that the notes which the editor has affixed, would almo&s;t per&s;uade the reader that he had publi&s;hed the work with a view to take an invidious retro&s;pect of PARKIN|SON's "Theatre." In the preface to the "<HI>Phytologia,</HI>" and in that of this work, both written in a flowery and bomba&s;t &s;tile, as well
<PB N="174" REF="193">
as throughout the notes, he &s;peaks of PAR|KINSON in very contemptuous language, and repre&s;ents him as having made LOBEL's ob&s;ervations his own, without acknow|ledgment. Whatever may have been the ca&s;e in particular in&s;tances, the attack, on the whole, was uncandid; &s;ince PARKIN|SON, in the very title of his "<HI>Theatre,</HI>" pro|fe&s;&s;es to have made u&s;e of, and in&s;erted, Dr. LOBEL's notes, together with tho&s;e of Dr. BONHAM and others. In fact, there is a pe|tulance and an acrimony in the &s;tile, both of the author and of the editor of this work, which, how&s;oever exampled in the la&s;t age, is, happily, much le&s;s frequently the lan|guage of literature in the pre&s;ent.</P>

<P>ALTHOUGH it does not appear that the TRADESCANTS contributed materially to amplify what is more e&s;peci|ally meant by Engli&s;h Botany, or the di&s;co|very and illu&s;tration of the plants &s;ponta|neou&s;ly growing in <HI>England:</HI> yet, in a work devoted to the commemoration of Botani&s;ts, their name &s;tands too high not to demand an honourable notice; &s;ince they contributed, at an early period, by their
<PB N="176" REF="195">
garden and mu&s;eum, to rai&s;e a curio&s;ity that was eminently u&s;eful to the progre&s;s and improvement of natural hi&s;tory in general.</P>
<P><HI>John</HI> TRADESCANT was by birth a Dutch man, as we are informed by A. <HI>Wood.</HI> On what occa&s;ion, and at what period, he came into <HI>England,</HI> is not preci&s;e|ly a&s;certained. He is &s;aid to have been, for a con&s;iderable time, in the &s;ervice of Lord Trea&s;urer SALISBURY and Lord WOOTON. He travelled &s;everal years, and into various parts of <HI>Europe;</HI> as far ea&s;tward as into <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia.</HI> He was in a fleet that was &s;ent again&s;t the <HI>Algerines</HI> in 1620, and mention is made of his collecting plants in <HI>Barbary,</HI> and in the i&s;les of the Mediterranean. He is &s;aid to have brought the <HI>trifolium &s;tella|tum Lin.</HI> from the i&s;le of <HI>Fermentera;</HI> and his name frequently occurs in the &s;econd edition of GERARD by JOHNSON; in PAR|KINSON's "Theatre of Plants," and in his "Garden of Flowers," printed in 1656. But I conjecture that TRADESCANT was not re&s;ident in <HI>England</HI> in the time of GE|RARD him&s;elf, or known to him.</P>
<P>He appears however to have been e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
<PB N="177" REF="196">
in <HI>England,</HI> and his garden founded at <HI>Lambeth;</HI> about the year 1629 he ob|tained the title of gardener to <HI>Charles</HI> I. TRADESCANT was a man of extraordinary curio&s;ity, and the fir&s;t in this country, who made any con&s;iderable collection of the &s;ub|jects of natural hi&s;tory. He had a &s;on of the &s;ame name, who took a voyage to <HI>Virginia,</HI> from whence he returned with many new plants. They were the means of introduc|ing a variety of curious &s;pecies into this kingdom; &s;everal of which bore their name. <HI>Trade&s;cant's Spiderwort, Trade&s;cant's A&s;ter,</HI> are well known to this day; and LINNAEUS has immortalized them among the Bota|ni&s;ts, by making a new genus, under their name, of the <HI>Spiderwort,</HI> which had before been called <HI>Ephemeron.</HI> His Mu&s;eum, called <HI>Trade&s;cant</HI>'s Ark, attracted the curio&s;ity of the age, and was much frequented by the great, by who&s;e means it was al&s;o much enlarged, as appears by the li&s;t of his bene|factors, printed at the end of "his MUSEUM TRADESCANTIANUM;" among whom, after the names of the king and queen, are found tho&s;e of many of the fir&s;t nobility.</P>

It contains li&s;ts of his birds, quadrupeds, fi&s;h, &s;hells, in&s;ects, minerals, fruits, artificial and mi&s;cellaneous curio&s;ities, war in&s;truments, habits, uten&s;ils, coins, and medals. The&s;e are followed by a catalogue, in Engli&s;h and Latin, of the plants of his garden, and a li&s;t of his be|nefactors. The reader may &s;ee a curious account of the remains of this garden, drawn up in the year 1749, by the late Sir <HI>William</HI> WATSON, and printed in the 46th volume of the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions. Prefixed to this volume were the prints of both father and &s;on; which, from the cir|cum&s;tance of being engraved by HOLLAR, has rendered the book well known to the collectors of prints, by whom mo&s;t of the copies have been plundered of the impre&s;|&s;ions.</P>

<HEAD>R. TURNER, CULPEPPER, and LOVELL.</HEAD>
<P>The influence of A&s;trology in Phy&s;ic and Botany, was far from being worn out in the middle of this age. By the credulity and &s;uper&s;tition of &s;ome, and the di&s;hone&s;ty of others, it &s;till maintained its ground. Se|veral
<PB N="180" REF="199">
phy&s;icians, and other men of learning, &s;hewed &s;ome bias towards it. Many prac|titioners of an inferior cla&s;s, and numerous empirics, were &s;till advocates for a&s;trological influence in the preparation and application of &s;imples.</P>
<P>There is an Herbal written by <HI>Robert</HI> TURNER, who calls him&s;elf <HI>Botanologiae Studio&s;us,</HI> under the title of "BOTANO|LOGIA, the Briti&s;h Phy&s;ician; or, The Nature and Vertues of Engli&s;h Plants; exactly de&s;cribing &s;uch as grow naturally in the land, with their &s;everal names, Greek, Latin, or Engli&s;h; natures, places where they flouri&s;h, and are mo&s;t proper to be gathered; their degrees of tempera|ture, applications, and vertues, phy&s;ical and a&s;trological u&s;es treated of, &amp;c." London, 1664, 12^o. But, of the a&s;tro|logical herbali&s;ts, <HI>Nicholas</HI> CULPEPPER &s;tands eminently forward. His "Herbal," fir&s;t printed in 1652, which c ontinued for more than a century, to be the manual of good ladies in the country, is well known; and, to do the author ju&s;tice, his de&s;criptions of common plants were drawn up with a
<PB N="181" REF="200">
clearne&s;s and di&s;tinction that would not have di&s;graced a better pen.</P>
<P>Yet there is one author of this order, who&s;e re&s;pectability might exempt him from to|tal oblivion. <HI>Robert</HI> LOVELL's "compleat Herbal," although &s;aid to be written by him whil&s;t a young man, is of &s;o &s;ingular a complexion, as to merit notice in a work of this kind, were it only to regret the mi&s;|application of talents, which demon&s;trate an exten&s;ive knowledge of books, a won|derful indu&s;try in the collection of his ma|terials, and not le&s;s judgment in the ar|rangement. The fir&s;t edition was printed in 1659; the &s;econd in 1665, in 8^o. at <HI>Ox|&s;ord,</HI> pp. 672, exclu&s;ive of the introduc|tion of 84 pages, and bears the following title, "PAMBOTANOLOGIA: <HI>&s;ive Enchi|ridion Botanicum;</HI> or, A compleat Her|bal; containing the &s;um of antient and modern authors, both Galenical and Chymical, touching trees, &s;hrubs, plants, fruits, flowers, &amp;c. in an alphabetical order, wherein all that are not in the phy&s;ic garden in <HI>Oxford</HI> are noted with a&s;teri&s;ks.

<P>To tho&s;e who&s;e curio&s;ity leans that way, it may not be ea&s;y to direct them to a more conci&s;e, or more perfectly methodical ar|rangement of &s;imples, according to the Ga|lenical principles of the four elements, tem|peraments, and qualities, than may be met with in the introduction to this book.</P>
<P>The arrangement of the matter in the work it&s;elf is according to the alphabet of the Engli&s;h names; to which is &s;ubjoined the place of growth, the time of flowering, then the name in Greek, and the Latin of|ficinal term. There are no de&s;criptions of the plants; but the qualities and u&s;es of each are collected from a profu&s;ion of au|thors, and applied to all the &s;pecies under each generical term; the form in which the medicine &s;hould be given, the authority for each carefully cited, and the officinal

<P>He profe&s;&s;es to have cited near two hun|dred and fifty authors, of which he gives the li&s;t. At p. 482 begins an appendix on the drugs of the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, ex|tracted from the Arabians, and from HER|NANDEZ. A copious index of names to all the plants of his "Herbal," with the &s;ynonyms; e&s;pecially of the older au|thors; of &s;uch as are mentioned in TRA|DESCANT; BAUHINE's <HI>Pinax;</HI> of tho&s;e which are in the foreign botanical gardens, and not in that of <HI>Oxford;</HI> and la&s;tly, of tho&s;e in the PHYTOLOGIA BRITANNICA. The work concludes with a large index of di&s;ea&s;es, with the appropriate remedies from the &s;imples of his work.

<P>If my readers will excu&s;e the anachroni&s;m, I am here tempted to anticipate the name of an author, the complexion of who&s;e

<P>The order of SALMON's book is alphabe|tical, and, as it is a work of mere compila|tion, he profe&s;&s;es to have con&s;ulted all the botanical authors of repute, and enumerates the names of &s;uch. His de&s;ign was to treat on medicinal herbs principally. As a bo|tanical work it is beneath all critici&s;m; the errors in this way being enormous, both in multitude and degree. In detailing the powers of &s;imples, he follows the Galenic terms of expre&s;&s;ion ufed by the writers of the preceding century, and di&s;tributes, with a lavi&s;h hand, extraordinary and numerous powers to almo&s;t every herb he de&s;cribes. Exclu&s;ive of his indu&s;try, &s;ome merit is due to SALMON for the regular arrangement of

his &s;ubjects, &s;ubordinate to his method; qualities which, under the direction of more &s;kill in Botany, and a &s;ounder judge|ment in di&s;criminating the properties of &s;imples, might have enabled him to have executed more effectually what &s;eems to have been his purpo&s;e, that of &s;uper&s;eding the Herbals of GERARD and PARKINSON, in which he totally failed.

On this occa&s;ion I &s;ingularly lament, that I am not furni&s;hed with any new ma|terials to illu&s;trate the life of RAY; of whom it may with truth be maintained, that in the&s;e branches of natural hi&s;tory, he became, without the patronage of an <HI>Alexander,</HI> the <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and the <HI>Linnaeus</HI> of the time.</P>

<HEAD>RAY.</HEAD>
<P>IF we here take a retro&s;pective view of the progre&s;s of botany during the fir&s;t period of the &s;eventeenth century, we find that, however particular individuals, both in <HI>England</HI> and on the continent, might have laboured in its advancement, it was not, on the whole, in a flouri&s;hing &s;tate, either here, or in any other part of <HI>Europe.</HI> From the time of the BAUHINES, even to that of RAY, its progre&s;s as a &s;cience was &s;low. The Remains of <HI>John</HI> BAU|HINE, his "<HI>Hi&s;toria Plantarum Univer|&s;alis,</HI>" printed in 1650, in three large
<PB N="190" REF="209">
folio volumes, at the expence of 40,000 florins, defrayed by F. L. <HI>&agrave; Graffenreid,</HI> was the principal performance on the con|tinent, and that indeed was invaluable. It is a monument of learning and indu&s;try, of which few examples can be expected in any one age. That which GESNER performed for zoology. <HI>John</HI> BAUHINE effected in botany. It is, in reality, a repo&s;itory of all that was valuable in the ancients, in his immediate predece&s;&s;ors, and in the di&s;cove|ries of his own time, relating to the hi&s;tory of vegetables, and is executed with that accuracy and critical judgment which can only be exhibited by &s;uperior talents.</P>
<P>The ob&s;tacles to the improvement of botany were various. <HI>Europe</HI> had been in|volved in war, the perpetual enemy to free intercour&s;e among the learned; and to commerce, which is ever friendly to natural &s;cience. Simples were neglected in phy&s;ic, for medicines drawn from chymi&s;try. Even alchymy yet employed the indu&s;try of many in every nation of <HI>Europe.</HI> Botanical gar|dens, although &s;everal, both public and pri|vate, had been e&s;tabli&s;hed, did not, however,
<PB N="191" REF="210">
flouri&s;h. The <HI>Indies</HI> had not yet poured in their trea&s;ures with that liberal hand which was &s;oon after experienced. Even the pa&s;|&s;ion of the flori&s;t for varieties a&s;&s;i&s;ted in depre&s;&s;ing the genuine &s;pirit of the bota|ni&s;t. But the time was now approaching, when botany was about to receive a capi|tal advantage and embelli&s;hment, by the introduction and e&s;tabli&s;hment of <HI>&s;y&s;tem;</HI> of the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of which, it will not be incongruous to my plan to give a &s;hort account, &s;ince this great revolution formed a new aera in the hi&s;tory of the &s;cience. As the revival of it, however, did not take place till the time of Mr. RAY and Dr. MORISON, I will po&s;tpone what I have to &s;ay on this &s;ubject, till I have given &s;ome account of the writings of tho&s;e ju&s;tly celebrated naturali&s;ts, by who&s;e la|bours &s;y&s;tem it&s;elf was re&s;tored and im|proved.</P>
<P>The earlie&s;t anecdotes of Mr. RAY, to which I can refer, are &s;ome brief outlines of his life, in the "Compleat Hi&s;tory of Eu|rope for the year 1705." A more con|nected account of this learned and excellent man may be &s;een in the "General Dictio|nary,"
<PB N="192" REF="211">
and the "Biographia Britannica;" but the mo&s;t detailed relation is that of Dr. SCOTT, publi&s;hed in 1760, from ma|terials collected by Dr. DERHAM. This is well abridged in the <HI>Biographical Dictio|nary.</HI> It is much to be regretted, that our curio&s;ity has not been more amply grati|fied than by the&s;e &s;hort and imperfect me|moirs.</P>
<P>A more circum&s;tantial narrative of the life of Mr. RAY would, even at this di&s;tance of time, be a valuable acce&s;&s;ion to biography, and highly grateful to tho&s;e, who are &s;en&s;ible of the great improvements which he gave to the &s;cience of natural hi&s;tory in general; nor could &s;ufficient ju&s;tice be done to his manifold talents, di&s;coveries, and writings, but by a pen of the fir&s;t eminence in bio|graphical literature.</P>
<P>The limits of my plan will not allow of more than a general detail of the principal events of his life, as connected in chrono|logical order with his writings.</P>
<P>John <HI>Wray,</HI> or, as he always &s;pelt his name after the year 1669, RAY, was born at <HI>Black Notley,</HI> near <HI>Braintree,</HI> in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> Nov. 29,
<PB N="193" REF="212">
1628. His father, though in &s;o humble a &s;ituation as that of a black&s;mith, &s;ent his &s;on to the grammar-&s;chool at <HI>Braintree;</HI> and in 1644, entered him at Catherine Hall, in <HI>Cambridge;</HI> from whence he removed, in le&s;s than two years, to Trinity College, where the politer &s;ciences were more culti|vated. Dr. BARROW was his fellow pupil, and intimate friend, and, on account of their early proficiencies, both were the fa|vourites of their learned tutor, Dr. DU|PORT. He was cho&s;en minor-fellow of Trinity, in 1649; in 1651, was made Greek lecturer of the college; in 1653, mathe|matical lecturer; and in 1655, humanity reader. The&s;e appointments were &s;ufficient te&s;timonies of his talents and abilities at this early period. He afterwards pa&s;&s;ed through the offices of the college, and be|came tutor to many gentlemen of honour|able birth and attainments, who gave him due prai&s;e and acknowledgments for his watchful care of them. He al&s;o di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him&s;elf, while in college, as a &s;en|&s;ible and rational preacher, and a &s;ound divine. As his favourite &s;tudy was the
<PB N="194" REF="213">
works of God, he laid, at this time, in his college lectures, the foundation of his "Wi&s;dom of God in the Creation," and of his "Three Phy&s;ico-theological Di&s;|cour&s;es;" which were afterwards &s;o well received by the public.</P>
<P>At the period when Mr. RAY turned his attention to the &s;tudy of nature, the know|ledge of plants was not highly &s;uperior to the &s;tate in which TURNER had found it, in the &s;ame place, more than a century be|fore. In this &s;tudy RAY could find no ma&s;ter. I am not able to &s;ay, that a &s;ingle publication, of a &s;cientific nature, on the &s;ubject of plants, had ever appeared at <HI>Cam|bridge;</HI> for <HI>Maplet</HI>'s "Green Fore&s;t" will &s;carcely be thought worthy of that appella|tion. <HI>Oxford</HI> had, indeed, not only experi|enced the benefit of private encouragement, but of public munificence, in the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of a Garden. But at the &s;i&s;ter uni|ver&s;ity Mr. RAY &s;tood alone, him&s;elf indeed an ho&s;t! Self-taught as he was, and full of ardour, he &s;o forcibly di&s;played the uti|lity of botanical knowledge, and its inti|mate connection with the arts, and conve|niences

of life, independent even of tho&s;e charms, which the views of nature ever af|ford to contemplative minds, that he &s;oon made it an object of attention; and num|bered among his a&s;&s;ociates in the&s;e &s;tudies, Mr. NID, a &s;enior fellow of his own col|lege, Mr. <HI>Francis</HI> WILLUGHBY, and Mr. <HI>Peter</HI> COURTHOPE. The fir&s;t of the&s;e gentlemen became his in&s;eparable compa|nion; but he had the misfortune to deplore his death, a little time before the publica|tion of his fir&s;t work, which came out under the title of "CATALOGUS PLANTARUM CIRCA CANTABRIGIAM NASCENTIUM." <HI>Cantab.</HI> 1660." pp. 182. <HI>cum Indicibus,</HI> &amp;c. pp. 103. 12^o.</P>
<P>This little volume contains all the plants which the author had ob&s;erved &s;pontane|ou&s;ly growing in the neighbourhood of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> amounting to 626, all varieties and dubious plants excluded. The num|ber is &s;mall, when compared with many modern catalogues; but not &s;o, when it is recollected, that, at that period, a very few of the <HI>Cryptogamia</HI> cla&s;s, and not many of
<PB N="196" REF="215">
the <HI>Graminaceous</HI> tribe, had been inve&s;ti|gated.</P>
<P>The plants are di&s;po&s;ed in the alphabeti|cal order of the <HI>Latin</HI> names; and the &s;yno|nyms of the four principal authors then in u&s;e given at length. The&s;e are GERARD and PARKINSON, and the two BAUHINES; nor are others wanting, when characteri&s;tic of the plant. Prefixed is a li&s;t of the au|thors, &s;o accurately and in&s;tructively drawn up, as not to have lo&s;t its utility to this day. Mr. RAY has inter&s;per&s;ed many &s;e|lect ob&s;ervations, on the medicinal and oeco|nomical u&s;es of the plants; on the &s;truc|ture of the flower; on varieties: and has not only de&s;cribed &s;ome new plants, di&s;co|vered by him&s;elf, but given accurate di&s;|tinctions of many, before imperfectly known. Subjoined, the reader finds an index of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> names, preceding the <HI>Latin;</HI> an in|dex, &s;pecifying the particular places of the more rare plants; then, a copious etymo|logy of the names, and an explanation of the terms u&s;ed in the &s;cience. In fine, he has done every thing to facilitate the labour
<PB N="197" REF="216">
of the &s;tudent in this part, as in the for|mer to in&s;truct and entertain the more erudite reader.</P>
<P>I have been the more diffu&s;e on this &s;mall volume, as the author has ob&s;erved nearly the &s;ame plan, in his &s;ub&s;equent catalogues, and SYNOPSIS. <HI>Moles parva, Vis magna.</HI> When the time in which this publication was made, and the meagre &s;tructure of pre|ceding catalogues is con&s;idered, I may &s;afely appeal to modern judges, whether this was not an extraordinary production. Few lo|cal catalogues had been publi&s;hed at home; and, I believe, not one abroad, that di&s;|played any thing like a comparable &s;hare of &s;cience and erudition, &s;o aptly united.</P>
<P>Among the variety of notes in this cata|logue, there is one, po&s;&s;ibly not of public notoriety. Mr. RAY informs us, that the people of <HI>Norwich</HI> had long excelled in the culture and production of fine flowers; and that in tho&s;e days, the flori&s;ts held their annual fea&s;ts, and crowned the be&s;t flower with a premium, as at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>There can be no doubt that this volume met with the mo&s;t favourable reception
<PB N="198" REF="217">
from the learned in this way; that it pro|moted the &s;tudy of plants; and, by rai&s;ing the reputation of its author, encouraged him to pro&s;ecute his &s;tudies with vigour.</P>
<P>The&s;e occupations, however, did not di|vert Mr. RAY from his object of entering into the mini&s;try. He was, in Dec. 1660, ordained both deacon and prie&s;t, by Dr. <HI>Sander&s;on,</HI> bi&s;hop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> and conti|nued fellow of <HI>Trinity College</HI> till the Bar|tholomew act; which, as he did not &s;ub|&s;cribe, nece&s;&s;arily &s;uper&s;eded him. This event took place Sept. 18, 1662.</P>
<P>The de&s;ire Mr. RAY had to extend his knowledge of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> botany, had induced him, in the autumn of 1658, to take a jour|ney, which he performed alone, through the midland counties of <HI>England,</HI> and the nor|thern part of <HI>Wales,</HI> in &s;earch of plants. This tour held him from Augu&s;t 9, to September 18. Of this, and of two other tours, Mr. RAY pre&s;erved &s;ome &s;hort me|morandums, in which he has noticed his daily progre&s;s, &s;ome remarkable facts that occur|red, &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the antiquities that he met with, and &s;ome of the rare
<PB N="199" REF="218">
plants. Dr. SCOTT has publi&s;hed the&s;e <HI>Itineraries,</HI> with his life.</P>
<P>In his &s;ub&s;equent journies, he was com|monly accompanied by &s;ome friends of a congenial ta&s;te; thus, in his &s;econd tour, in the autumn of 1661, Mr. WILLUGHBY, and &s;ome other gentlemen, travelled with Mr. RAY into <HI>Scotland,</HI> through the coun|ties of <HI>Durham</HI> and <HI>Northumberland,</HI> to <HI>Edin|burgh, Gla&s;gow,</HI> and back through <HI>Cumber|land</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmorland.</HI> This journey held &s;ix weeks, from July 26, to Augu&s;t 30. In 1662, Mr. RAY, accompanied by Mr. WILLUGHBY, took his third and mo&s;t ex|ten&s;ive <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> tour; through the middle counties of <HI>England,</HI> into <HI>Che&s;hire;</HI> thence into <HI>North Wales,</HI> and through the middle <HI>Welch</HI> counties, into <HI>Pembroke&s;hire,</HI> coa&s;ting the &s;outhern part, to <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Bri&s;tol;</HI> thence to the <HI>Land's End,</HI> through <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> and <HI>De|von;</HI> returning through <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire, Wilt|&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Hamp&s;hire.</HI> They were ab&s;ent in this excur&s;ion, from May 8, to July 18; and Mr. RAY gathered a plentiful harve&s;t, which afterwards enabled him to enrich his general "Catalogue of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plants,"
<PB N="200" REF="219">
then in meditation; nor did he omit to avail him&s;elf of every opportunity, particularly at <HI>Tenby,</HI> in <HI>Wales,</HI> and in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> of de|&s;cribing &s;uch birds and fi&s;hes as were le&s;s frequent in other parts, preparatory to his intended publications in the zoological way.</P>
<P>In 1663 he publi&s;hed an <HI>Appendix</HI> to the "Cambridge Catalogue," containing emen|dations, and the addition of forty-two plants. And in 1685, came out another <HI>Appendix,</HI> with the addition of &s;ixty more, not noticed before; which were principally communicated by Mr. DENT, of <HI>Cambridge.</HI> The&s;e little tracts are become very &s;carce. Tho&s;e who are curious to &s;ee what the&s;e additional plants were, may find them di&s;|tingui&s;hed from the others in Profe&s;&s;or MARTYN's "<HI>Plantae Cantabrigien&s;es.</HI>"</P>
<P>Being now at liberty from the con&s;traints and bu&s;ine&s;s of a college life, he was led to accompany Mr. WILLUGHBY, Mr. SKIP|PON, and Mr. <HI>Nathaniel</HI> BACON, two of them his pupils, to the continent. Mr. RAY was ab&s;ent from April 18, 1663, to March 1665-6; during which time, they
<PB N="201" REF="220">
vi&s;ited <HI>France, Holland, Germany, Switzer|land, Italy;</HI> and extended their journey to <HI>Sicily</HI> and to <HI>Malta.</HI> The fruit of this ex|pedition will afterwards appear.</P>
<P>On his return from the continent, he &s;pent the &s;ummer of 1666 between his friends in <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> and in reading the publications which had appeared in <HI>England</HI> during the three years of his ab|&s;ence. The winter pa&s;&s;ed in reviewing and arranging the mu&s;eum of his friend and pu|pil, Mr. WILLUGHBY, rich in animal and fo&s;&s;il productions; in arranging his own catalogues for his general li&s;t of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> vegetables; and in framing the tables for Dr. WILKINS's "Real, or Univer&s;al Cha|racter."</P>
<P>In the &s;ummer of 1667, Mr. RAY, ac|companied by his much-honoured friend, Mr. WILLUGHBY, made his fourth excur|&s;ion into the di&s;tant counties. They left <HI>Middleton Park</HI> on June 25, and took their route to the <HI>Land's End,</HI> through the coun|ties of <HI>Worce&s;ter, Glouce&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Somer&s;et;</HI> and returned through <HI>Hants</HI> to <HI>London</HI> on September 13. In this journey, be&s;ides the
<PB N="202" REF="221">
pointed objects of their pur&s;uit, they took notes on the mines, and &s;melting, and on the method of making &s;alt; and Mr. RAY did not omit to make, as he had done be|fore, ample additions for his collections of proverbs and of local <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> words.</P>
<P>On Nov. 7, of this year, he was cho&s;en fellow of the Royal Society, and was pre|vailed on by Bi&s;hop WILKINS to tran&s;late his "Real Character" into <HI>Latin.</HI> This he performed, though it was never pub|li&s;hed; and the manu&s;cript is extant in the library of the Royal Society. The latter end of the year, and the beginning of 1668, he &s;pent with gentlemen who had all been his pupils at Trinity; Mr. BURREL, and Mr. COURTHOPE, at <HI>Danny,</HI> in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex;</HI> Sir <HI>Ro|bert</HI> BARNHAM, at <HI>Bocton,</HI> in <HI>Kent;</HI> and with Mr. WILLUGHBY, in <HI>Warwick&s;hire.</HI> In the autumn of this year, he took his fifth journey, alone, into <HI>York&s;hire</HI> and <HI>We&s;t|morland,</HI> returning in September to <HI>Middle|ton Hall;</HI> and &s;pent the winter with Mr. WILLUGHBY, then lately married.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>RAY.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT this time Dr. TONGE, Dr. BEAL, and &s;ome other philo&s;ophical gentlemen, in <HI>England,</HI> were bu&s;ied in ex|periments relating to the motion of the &s;ap in trees. Among the&s;e al&s;o, in the &s;pring of 1669, Mr. RAY and Mr. WILLUGHBY entered upon a &s;et of the like experiments, and induced Mr. (afterwards Dr.) LISTER, to pro&s;ecute the &s;ame. The&s;e experiments were made on the birch, the &s;ycamore or greater maple, the alder, the a&s;h, the ha&s;el, che&s;nut, walnut, and willow; of which the two fir&s;t
<PB N="204" REF="223">
were found to be the be&s;t adapted to the purpo&s;e, from their bleeding mo&s;t freely.</P>
<P>The experiments of Mr. RAY and Mr. WILLUGHBY, which were printed in the fourth volume of the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;|actions,</HI> proved the a&s;cent and de&s;cent, as well as the lateral cour&s;e, of the &s;ap; but the&s;e gentlemen declined giving any deci|&s;ive opinion, as to a real circulation up|wards by the ve&s;&s;els of the wood, and downwards by tho&s;e between the wood and the bark; which was the doctrine main|tained &s;oon after this time by GREW and MALPHIGI, and indeed afterwards adopt|ed by Mr. RAY him&s;elf.</P>
<P>This doctrine of the circulation of the &s;ap, I need &s;carcely remark, gave way to the experiments of Dr. HALES and others; which teaches, that the &s;ap ri&s;es and falls, in the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem of ve&s;&s;els, as it is affected by the joint operations of air and warmth. Yet there have not been wanting ingenious men of late years, al&s;o, who, conceiving the analogy between animals and vegetables to be greater than is u&s;ually imagined, and even that plants not only live, but feel, have
<PB N="205" REF="224">
advanced it as &s;till probable, that there is a real circulation of the juices; the <HI>&s;uccus com|munis</HI> ri&s;ing from the roots, and the <HI>&s;uccus proprius</HI> de&s;cending towards them. Whe|ther the&s;e phy&s;iologies will yield to the <HI>pro|lep&s;is plantarum</HI> of the LINNAEAN &s;chool, time mu&s;t evince.</P>
<P>When Mr. RAY was at <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> in 1669, he availed him&s;elf of an opportunity of viewing a young porpe&s;s, and of attend|ing the di&s;&s;ection of it. Of the anato|mical &s;tructure of this animal, he com|municated a circum&s;tantial account to the R. S. in 1671; and it was printed in the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions,</HI> N^o 74 and 76.</P>
<P>In 1671, Mr. RAY wrote a paper, print|ed in the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions,</HI> N^o 74, on the &s;ubject of "Spontaneous Genera|tion," a point of philo&s;ophy which had been much di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and to which &s;ome among the learned were yet attached. It appears from this paper, that he very early rejected this doctrine, and was confirmed in his opinion by the experiments of REDI.</P>
<P>We are now to reap the fruit of Mr. RAY's repeated journies into the various
<PB N="206" REF="225">
parts of <HI>England,</HI> taken with a profe&s;&s;ed view, to a&s;certain the <HI>loci natales</HI> of all the native plants, more accurately than had yet been done; to inve&s;tigate the more rare, and perchance to di&s;cover new ones. In each of the&s;e departments he had proved &s;ucce&s;s|ful, and in this year drew up his "Cata|logue," and dedicated it to his friend and Maecenas Mr. WILLUGHBY, under the fol|lowing title, "CATALOGUS PLANTARUM ANGLIAE <HI>et in&s;ularum adjacentium tum indigenas tum in agris pa&s;&s;im cultas com|plectens.</HI>" <HI>Lond.</HI> 1670, pp. 358. 8^o.</P>
<P>This work is modelled after the <HI>Cam|bridge</HI> Catalogue in general, as to the order of the &s;ubject, except that the author has been much more &s;paring of the &s;ynonyms, from all authors but the four cla&s;&s;ial wri|ters, GERARD, PARKINSON, and the two BAUHINES. Several new plants are de|&s;cribed in this volume, and many doubtful ones di&s;criminated, with that critical accu|racy which &s;o &s;ingularly marked his pen; and which had not before been &s;een in any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> writer.</P>
<P>Hitherto the <HI>cryptogamous</HI> and <HI>gramina|ceous</HI>
<PB N="207" REF="226">
tribe, had engaged but little atten|tion; and in this volume, the&s;e cla&s;&s;es do not far exceed the number regi&s;tered in the <HI>Cambridge</HI> Catalogue. The whole number of plants in this li&s;t, amount to about 1050 only. This &s;mall number had been owing to the extreme caution of Mr. RAY, not to admit any varieties to hold the place of &s;pecies; and to exclude all others on doubt|ful authority. How, in his "<HI>Phytologia,</HI>" has upwards of 1200; and MERRETT, in his "<HI>Pinax,</HI>" upwards of 1400; certain proofs that the authors had not &s;ufficiently &s;tudied the nicer di&s;tinctions, which guided the judgment of Mr. RAY; and as a proof, it may be ob&s;erved, that many of their plants are to this day undi&s;covered. Sen&s;ible as Mr. RAY was of the errors of MERRETT's "<HI>Pinax,</HI>" he purpo&s;ely omitted quoting it, as he writes to Dr. LISTER, that he might avoid that cen&s;ure of it, which could not properly have been withheld, had he given his impartial opinion of that performance.</P>
<P>In this year, he informs Dr. LISTER, that he had, what he thought, a mo&s;t libe|ral offer, of one hundred pounds a year, and
<PB N="208" REF="227">
all his expences defrayed, to accompany three young gentlemen abroad. But he declined it, although he much wi&s;hed to have taken a review of the alpine plants. Indi&s;po&s;i|tion had &s;ome &s;hare in this refu&s;al, and we find that in the next &s;pring, 1671, he &s;uf|fered much from a jaundice. He was &s;o far recovered, however, before <HI>July,</HI> as to be able to &s;et off on his &s;ixth journey, in which he took with him <HI>Thomas</HI> WILLISEL, an unlettered man, but one, who&s;e love for plants, and his zeal and a&s;&s;iduity in collect|ing them, merits commemoration. They travelled through <HI>Derby&s;hire, York&s;hire,</HI> and all the northern counties, as far as to <HI>Ber|wick,</HI> and back through the bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Durham.</HI></P>
<P>In the &s;ame year died, to the un&s;peakable lo&s;s and grief of Mr. RAY, his mo&s;t valua|ble friend <HI>Francis</HI> WILLUGHBY, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> on <HI>July</HI> 3d, in the 37th year of his age. The &s;tricte&s;t intimacy had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them, from the time of their being fellow collegians; and it was cemented by a con|geniality of ta&s;te, which not unfrequently forms a &s;tronger bond of union, than the
<PB N="209" REF="228">
ties of blood. Mr. WILLUGHBY had im|bibed, very early, a &s;trong ta&s;te for the &s;tudy of the animal kingdom, and had made extraordinary collections for compleating the "Hi&s;tory of Birds and Fi&s;hes;" in which he had ever been a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his friend Mr. RAY; who experienced his high attachment and confidence, in being left one of his executors, and charged with the education of his two &s;ons, the elde&s;t of whom, was not four years of age. To this care he liberally annexed an annuity of &s;ixty pounds per annum for life, which was ever regularly paid.</P>
<P>Immediately after this melancholy event, he de&s;i&s;ted from journeying again into the we&s;tern counties, as he had intended; and refu&s;ed an invitation from Dr. LISTER, to live with him at <HI>York;</HI> in order to give him&s;elf up to the faithful di&s;charge of his tru&s;t.</P>
<P>For the u&s;e of the&s;e young gentlemen, Mr. RAY drew up, in 1672, his <HI>Nomen|clator Cla&s;&s;icus,</HI> induced thereto by ob&s;erv|ing the multitude of errors in the names of plants and animals, in the manuals of daily u&s;e. This compilation had authority
<PB N="210" REF="229">
enough to recommend it&s;elf to &s;ub&s;equent writers of dictionaries and lexicons, and has been reprinted &s;everal times.</P>
<P>On <HI>November</HI> 19th, 1672, he &s;u&s;tained, in the death of Bi&s;hop WILKINS, the lo&s;s of another of his be&s;t friends. For this candid, ingenious, and learned man, he had a &s;incere e&s;teem and veneration.</P>
<P>In the lot of human life, &s;uch cha&s;ms are not ea&s;ily filled up after the age of forty-five. It is however not unrea&s;onable to con|jecture, that the&s;e privations added &s;trength to his motives for dome&s;tic retirement, and accelerated at lea&s;t, that connexion he made the next year, when he married Mar|garet the daughter of Mr. <HI>John Oakely,</HI> of <HI>Launton,</HI> in <HI>Oxford&s;hire.</HI> They were mar|ried in the church of <HI>Middleton,</HI> on <HI>June</HI> the 5th, 1673.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame year Mr. RAY gave to the public the fruit of his foreign travels, under the title of, "Ob&s;ervations, topographical, moral, and phy&s;iological, made in a jour|ney through part of the Low Countries, <HI>Germany, Italy,</HI> and <HI>France.</HI>" <HI>London,</HI> 1673. 8^o. pp. 499.</P>
<P>The great object of accompanying his
<PB N="211" REF="230">
three a&s;&s;ociates in this tour, was, the en|largement of his knowledge in natural hi&s;|tory, and particularly in the vegetable king|dom; and the great number of plants ob|&s;erved and collected by him, exceeded, as he informs us, his expectation: not that any opportunities e&s;caped him of de&s;cribing the birds and fi&s;hes of the &s;everal countries they pa&s;&s;ed through, in aid of Mr. WIL|LUGHBY's plans. His notes concerning tho&s;e of <HI>Germany,</HI> were unfortunately lo&s;t. The volume before us, however, is by no means confined to natural hi&s;tory. Mr. RAY treats on the manners of the people, and expatiates often on the excellencies and defects of the &s;everal governments, particu|larly of the cities on the continent, and on the &s;tate of the academies and univer&s;ities. He does not omit to notice the antiquities that occurred and of tho&s;e at <HI>Rome,</HI> he gives a very methodical account. Be&s;ides many mi&s;cellaneous remarks on various other parts of natural hi&s;tory, he has taken occa|&s;ion to make a digre&s;&s;ion, which, at that time, mu&s;t have been of a very intere&s;ting nature, on the mo&s;t remarkable places,
<PB N="212" REF="231">
where petrified &s;hells and figured fo&s;&s;ils are found, both in <HI>England</HI> and el&s;ewhere; and on the various opinions of authors, re|lating to the origin of the&s;e bodies. He freely declares his &s;entiments, that they are the remains of once-organized bodies, in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e who imagined them to be the product of what they called a <HI>pla&s;tic</HI> power. He afterwards confirms his po&s;i|tions, by additional arguments recited in a letter to Dr. ROBINSON. See <HI>Letters,</HI> p. 165.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of their journey, he every where notices tho&s;e plants that are not na|tives of <HI>England,</HI> and gives copious cata|logues of them. They &s;pent in the whole, &s;ix months at <HI>Geneva,</HI> which gave Mr. RAY an opportunity of informing him&s;elf largely, relating to the plants of <HI>Switzer|land,</HI> particularly tho&s;e of Mount <HI>Sa|leve,</HI> the <HI>Dole,</HI> and of Mount <HI>Jura.</HI> He even di&s;covered &s;ome that were unknown to the preceding botani&s;ts, although the&s;e were the regions of GESNER, and the BAUHINES.</P>
<P>The celebrated HALLER, even ranks
<PB N="213" REF="232">
him among tho&s;e who made large acce&s;&s;ions to the Botany of that country, and gives the &s;tronge&s;t te&s;timony of his &s;kill, fidelity, and judgment, in di&s;criminating, de&s;cribing, and extricating the plants of that fruitful region.</P>
<P>To the end of the&s;e "Ob&s;ervations," is affixed an alphabetical li&s;t of the plants mentioned in the body of the book, under the title of "CATALOGUS STIRPIUM IN EXTERIS REGIONIBUS, <HI>&agrave; nobis ob&s;ervata|rum, quae vel omnino vel parc&egrave; admodum in Anglia &s;ponte proveniunt.</HI>" pp. 115.</P>
<P>In the arrangement he cites the &s;ame au|thors for &s;ynonyms as in his preceding ca|talogues, and occa&s;ionally introduces ob&s;er|vations on the qualities and u&s;es.</P>

<P>Of &s;uch as have been handed down in <HI>Britain,</HI> from father to &s;on, through nu|merous generations, Mr. RAY's collection contains an ample &s;tore.

In the fir&s;t edition was a catalogue of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> birds and fi&s;hes; but this was omitted in a &s;ub&s;equent improved and enlarged edition, in 1691, Mr. RAY having then projected his "<HI>Synop&s;is Animalium.</HI>"</P>
<P>This is one of tho&s;e philological collec|tions, which tends to amu&s;e and gratify gene|ral curio&s;ity, is of u&s;e, not only to &s;trangers and tho&s;e who travel, but to tho&s;e who &s;tay much at home; while it contributes to en|large the extent, and illu&s;trate the con&s;truc|tion of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> tongue.

<P><PB N="218" REF="237">
In the year 1677, his "Catalogue of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> plants" being out of print, he gave another edition, augmented with new ob&s;ervations, and the addition of 30 &s;pecies of the more perfect plants, and 16 <HI>fungu&s;es;</HI> &s;everal of the&s;e were new di&s;coveries.

<P>Mr. RAY continued, after his marriage, to re&s;ide at <HI>Middleton Hall,</HI> where his engage|ments at this period of his life, were &s;uch as called forth all the talents of his literary abilities, and demanded all his care as a faithful guardian. He was employed in a double duty, that of his tru&s;t to the &s;ons of his late e&s;timable friend, and of editor to the remains of their father, "On the Hi&s;|tory of Birds and Fi&s;hes." The <HI>Ornitho|logy</HI> was fir&s;t publi&s;hed, to which, as it con&s;i&s;ted of loo&s;e papers, written in <HI>Latin,</HI> and in an undige&s;ted &s;tate, Mr. RAY gave method, and &s;upplied, from his own ob&s;er|vations, a large &s;hare of valuable materials.

<P>Mr. RAY tran&s;lated this work into <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> and publi&s;hed it, with large additions, in 1678, with figures engraved at the ex|pence of Mrs. WILLUGHBY. The exe|cution of the figures was wholly inadequate to the merit of the work. The&s;e occupa|tions, however, did not prevent him from renewing a corre&s;pondence with Mr. OL|DENBURGH, &s;ecretary of the Royal Society, a learned German, who, after having re|&s;ided &s;ome time at <HI>Oxford,</HI> had been cho&s;en into that office at the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of the &s;ociety. Mr. RAY, in the year 1674, was induced to engage, at the reque&s;t of the &s;ociety, with other di&s;tant members, to furni&s;h ob&s;ervations on the &s;ubjects of na|tural hi&s;tory, to be read at their meetings; the &s;ociety notwith&s;tanding the extreme di|ligence of the &s;ecretary, and &s;ome few
<PB N="220" REF="239">
others, being, at this juncture, rather in a langui&s;hing &s;tate.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion he wrote &s;everal papers, of which &s;ome were afterwards printed in the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions.</HI> Among tho&s;e, which were not publi&s;hed, as we find by his letters, were the following.

<P>On the death of the mother of his friend, the Dowager Lady WILLUGHBY, and the removal of his &s;ons from under Mr. RAY's tuition, he retired, &s;ome time in the year 1676, to <HI>Sutton Cofield,</HI> about four miles di&s;tant from <HI>Middleton Hall,</HI> where he remained till Michaelmas 1677.

</ARGUMENT>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>RAY.</HEAD>
<P>MR. RAY being &s;ettled at <HI>Black Not|ley,</HI> and delivered from that anxiety which had attended him &s;ince Mr. WIL|LUGHBY's death, re&s;umed with great vigour his wonted &s;tudy of plants; and, having al|ready acquired a reputation that ju&s;tified any expectation his friends might have formed, he, in compliance with their wi&s;hes, at|tached him&s;elf &s;eriou&s;ly to write "A Gene|ral Hi&s;tory of Plants."</P>
<P>Preparatory to this great work, which he intended to arrange &s;y&s;tematically, he put forth, in 1682, his "METHODUS PLAN|TARUM," enlarged, and improved, from the
<PB N="223" REF="242">
&s;ynoptical tables, which he had printed in Bi&s;hop WILKINS's "Real Character," in 1668. It bears the following title:</P>
<P>"METHODUS PLANTARUM NOVA <HI>bre|vitatis et per&s;picuitatis cau&s;&acirc; &s;ynoptice in ta|bulis exhibita: cum notis Generum tum &s;um|morum tum &s;ubalternorum characteri&s;ticis. Ob&s;ervationibus nonnullis de &s;eminibus Plan|tarum et indice copio&s;o.</HI>" Lond. 1682. 8^o. pp. 166.</P>
<P>LINNAEUS, on what authority I know not, mentions an edition of this work, with the date of 1665, totally &s;eparate from that of 1682; but as that is earlier than Bi&s;hop WILKINS's Table, it is probably a mi&s;|take.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t principle of Mr. RAY, in this work, is to pre&s;erve all plants together, as far as po&s;&s;ible, in the natural characters, ari&s;ing from conformity in the fructifica|tion, and in the general habit. Hence aro&s;e, with him, in common as with others, too great a neglect of the flower, and too much attention to the leaves. He adheres to the ancient divi&s;ion of the vegetable kingdom, into trees, &s;hrubs, and herbaceous plants;
<PB N="224" REF="243">
ranking, however, with the latter, &s;uch as had been called <HI>Suffrutices,</HI> or &s;hrubby. <HI>Trees</HI> he divides into nine cla&s;&s;es, account|ing the la&s;t anomalous; <HI>Shrubs</HI> into &s;ix; and <HI>Herbs</HI> into forty-&s;even.</P>
<P>In the progre&s;s of his improvements after|wards, he reduced the&s;e cla&s;&s;es to thirty-three. His method, which is indeed ex|tremely elaborate, will be&s;t be &s;een by a view of the cla&s;&s;es. It will, however, be but ju&s;tice to refer the account to the la&s;t edition, that it may appear in the greate&s;t perfection which he gave it.</P>
<P>To this book Mr. RAY has &s;ubjoined a clear, conci&s;e view, and a &s;ynoptical table, of the &s;y&s;tem of CAESALPINE, and gives his rea&s;ons for not adopting it; although he candidly confe&s;&s;es his obligations to the author, whom he acknowledges to be the parent of &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>In 1683 and 1684, Mr. RAY and Dr. <HI>Tancred</HI> ROBINSON exchanged &s;everal let|ters, while the latter was on a foreign tour, relating to various undetermined facts in natural hi&s;tory; among which, it had been difficult to &s;ettle the exact &s;pecies of the
<PB N="225" REF="244">
<HI>Macru&s;e,</HI> a bird allowed by the Roman Catholics to be eaten in Lent. Their ob|&s;ervations relating to this particular were publi&s;hed in the <HI>Phil. Tran&s;.</HI> for 1685, in No. 172. It proved to be the <HI>Scoter,</HI> or <HI>Anas nigra Linnaei.</HI></P>
<P>We are now come to that performance, which LINNAEUS and HALLER &s;o ju&s;tly &s;tile <HI>Opus immen&s;i laboris;</HI> and which, con|&s;idered as the work of one man, has per|haps been exceeded by none, unle&s;s indeed by that of <HI>John</HI> BAUHINE, who, however, did not live to put the fini&s;hing hand to his labour.</P>
<P>Mr. RAY informs us, that it was at the per&s;ua&s;ion of his friend, Mr. WILLUGHBY, that he began to collect materials, with a view to a General Hi&s;tory of Plants. But that, after the lo&s;s of his friend in 1672, he relaxed; and, on hearing that Dr. MO|RISON was employed on a &s;imilar de&s;ign, from which con&s;iderable expectations were formed, at length gave up his purpo&s;e. On the decea&s;e of Dr. MORISON in 1683, who left the much greater part of his work un|fini&s;hed, by the per&s;ua&s;ion of his friends,
<PB N="226" REF="245">
and particularly of Mr. HOTTON, to whom it was dedicated, he re&s;umed his de&s;ign, and pro&s;ecuted the work with vigour. We can|not &s;ufficiently admire the wonderful a&s;&s;i|duity and addre&s;s of this great man, which enabled him, in four years, to collect &s;uch a &s;tock of matter, as to furni&s;h two folio volumes, of near one thou&s;and pages each. It even does not appear that he had the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an amanuen&s;is in this labour; which he effected, however, with a &s;kill and judgment that gained him the applau&s;e of all &s;ucceeding ma&s;ters in the &s;cience.</P>
<P>This important undertaking was intended by the author to comprehend the whole botany of the age, by de&s;cribing &s;eparately, and reducing to his own &s;y&s;tem, all the plants of the BAUHINES, and of tho&s;e who had enlarged the &s;tock by &s;ub&s;equent di&s;|coveries. The&s;e, at the publication of RAY's fir&s;t volume, were, the plants of <HI>Mexico,</HI> from HERNANDEZ; tho&s;e of <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> from PISO and MARCGRAAVE; and of the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> from BONTIUS. The rare plants of <HI>Italy,</HI> from ZANONI; the new plants of MORISON, BREYNIUS, and MENTZEL.
<PB N="227" REF="246">
The <HI>Sicilian</HI> plants of BOCCONE; but above all, the va&s;t trea&s;ure of the &s;ix fir&s;t volumes of the HORTUS MALABARICUS; with many from works of le&s;&s;er note.</P>
<P>After prefixing an in&s;tructive li&s;t of the writings of near an hundred botanical au|thors, quoted by him in the body of the book, and giving an explanation of terms, there follows a very comprehen&s;ive account of the philo&s;ophy of vegetables; in which the anatomy and phy&s;iology of plants, from MALPHIGI, from GREW, and from his own experiments; the differences of the parts of vegetables, from JUNGIUS and others, are explained and illu&s;trated, with that judg|ment and knowledge of the &s;ubject, and with that conci&s;ene&s;s and methodical accu|racy, which, I believe, had rarely, if ever, been equalled by preceding writers. This has rendered the introduction to his Hi&s;|tory, a choice compendium of all that was valuable in the &s;cience of his day; nor is the information it conveys &s;o far &s;uper&s;eded by any &s;ub&s;equent di&s;coveries, as to render it, even now, an unintere&s;ting tract. It is not ea&s;y to refer the modern &s;tudent to a
<PB N="228" REF="247">
more perfect view of the &s;tate of this &s;ci|ence near the clo&s;e of the la&s;t century, than will here be found; while the work it&s;elf exhibits the great improvement it had re|ceived, &s;ince the beginning of the &s;ame pe|riod, and to which the author had him&s;elf contributed in an eminent degree.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t volume was publi&s;hed in the year 1686, under the following title: "HIS|TORIA PLANTARUM GENERALIS: <HI>&s;pecies hactenus editas alia&s;que in&s;uper multas noviter inventas et de&s;criptas complectens; in qua agi|tur prim&ograve; de plantis in genere, earumque par|tibus, accidentibus, et differentiis&punc; deinde gene|ra omnia tum &s;umma tum &s;ubalterna ad &s;pecies u&s;que infimas, notis &s;uis certis et characteri&s;|ticis definita, methodo naturae ve&s;tigiis in&s;i&s;tente di&s;ponuntur; &s;pecies &s;ingulae accuratae de&s;cri|buntur, ob&s;cura illu&s;trantur, omi&s;&s;a &s;uppleatur &s;uperflua re&s;ecantur, &s;ynonyma nece&s;&s;aria adji|ciuntur: vires denique et u&s;us recepti compen|di&ograve; traduntur.

<P><PB N="229" REF="248">
In the general arrangement of the &s;ub|ject, according to his own &s;y&s;tem, he has in various in&s;tances improved the cla&s;&s;es. At the head of each book or cla&s;s is prefixed a &s;ynoptical table of all the chapters or <HI>ge|nera.</HI></P>
<P>In the particular di&s;po&s;ition, after prefix|ing to each chapter the etymology of the generical name, he gives the character of the <HI>genus;</HI> and in the enumeration of the &s;pecies, quotes at length the &s;ynonyms of <HI>Ca&s;par</HI> BAUHINE, from his "<HI>Pinax,</HI>" and tho&s;e of <HI>John</HI> BAUHINE, GERARD, and PARKINSON, from their re&s;pective hi&s;tories; &s;eldom introducing others, where the plant was known to any of the&s;e writers.</P>
<P>His de&s;criptions of the old plants are taken from the above-mentioned authors. They are commonly abridged, however; and in numberle&s;s in&s;tances amended, from his own knowledge of the plants. He fails not to notice from whom they are taken, and has every where di&s;tingui&s;hed the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> plants from the exotics. He has carefully marked all &s;uch as he had not had an opportunity of in&s;pecting him&s;elf. He adds the places of
<PB N="230" REF="249">
growth, and times of flowering, and &s;ub|joins &s;elect ob&s;ervations, from the mo&s;t re|&s;pectable authorities, relating to the quali|ties and various u&s;es of them.</P>
<P>In the "Hi&s;tory of Trees," the no|bler and more capital parts of the vegetable kingdom, as being dignified by the variety of their u&s;es in human oeconomy, he has extended his re&s;earches, and collected, with much a&s;&s;iduity, a greater variety of intere&s;t|ing particulars. Mr. RAY has purpo&s;ely avoided entering into nice and critical di&s;|qui&s;itions relating to the &s;pecies; for, be&s;ides that this would have &s;welled his work to an enormous bulk, it was become le&s;s ne|ce&s;&s;ary, after the de&s;criptions given by <HI>John</HI> BAUHINE, CLUSIUS, and others, &s;o much &s;uperior to tho&s;e of their predece&s;&s;ors; and the more curious and critical examiner might be referred to the&s;e authors, for ample &s;cope to his curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>Mr. RAY has de&s;cribed, in the&s;e vo|lumes, about 6900 plants; including, how|ever, in this number, many which modern botani&s;ts have &s;ince con&s;idered as varie|ties.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="250">
The <HI>Addenda</HI> to the &s;econd volume con|tain &s;everal intere&s;ting catalogues; &s;uch are tho&s;e of ZANONI's Hi&s;tory, con&s;i&s;ting of new <HI>Italian, Swi&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Milane&s;e</HI> plants; tho&s;e of BREYNIUS; a catalogue of the plants of <HI>Virginia,</HI> ob&s;erved by Mr. BANIS|TER; and a compend of tho&s;e of <HI>Mexico,</HI> from HERNANDEZ, who, at the expence of &s;ixty thou&s;and ducats, had procured the paintings of 1200 &s;pecies, which pe|ri&s;hed in a fire of the E&s;curial.</P>
<P>In the preface to the fir&s;t volume, Mr. RAY acknowledges his obligations for a&s;|&s;i&s;tance received from many of his friends. Among tho&s;e who had more e&s;&s;entially contributed to enrich his work, were, Sir <HI>Edward</HI> HULSE, Dr. <HI>Tancred</HI> ROBINSON, Dr. SLOANE, and his near neighbour, Mr. DALE. To the&s;e he adds, in the &s;econd volume, the names of <HI>William</HI> COURTINE, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of the Middle Temple, Dr. PLUKE|NET, Mr. DOODY, and Mr. PETIVER.</P>
<P>There are copies of RAY's Hi&s;tory, with the date of 1693; but I believe the title-page only to be new, the remaining
<PB N="232" REF="251">
copies of the impre&s;&s;ion by <HI>Faithorne,</HI> fal|ling into the hands of <HI>Smith</HI> and <HI>Walford</HI> about that time. Foreign writers mention an edition &s;o late as 1716; but this I &s;u&s;|pect to be a mi&s;take, or owing to another transfer of the copies.</P>
<P>After the fir&s;t edition of the "<HI>Catalogus Plantarum Angliae</HI>" was out of print, Mr. RAY had been exhorted by his friend, Dr. <HI>Ralph</HI> JOHNSON, to arrange the &s;econd ac|cording to &s;y&s;tem; but not having &s;uffi|ciently elaborated his method, at that time, he declined it; and it came out in 1677, in the alphabetical order.</P>
<P>A third edition being wanted, however, after the publication of the "Hi&s;tory of Plants," he meditated throwing it into the &s;y&s;tematic &s;orm; and, in the mean time, put forth, in 1688, "FASCICULUS STIR|PIUM BRITANNICARUM, <HI>po&s;l editum Plan|tarum Angliae Catalogum ob&s;ervatarum.</HI>" Lond. 8^o. By this little volume, a con|&s;iderable acce&s;&s;ion was made to <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> botany: &s;everal very rare mountainous or <HI>Alpine</HI> plants, from <HI>Wales;</HI> &s;ome &s;carce ones

<P>The "SYNOPSIS," although fini&s;hed for the pre&s;s &s;oon after this "<HI>Fa&s;ciculus,</HI>" was not publi&s;hed, owing to the delay of the printer, till 1690, when it appeared under this title, "SYNOPSIS METHODICA STIR|PIUM BRITANNICARUM, <HI>in qua tum notae generum characteri&s;ticae traduntur, tum &s;pe|cies &s;ingulae breviter de&s;cribuntur:</HI> 250 <HI>plus minus novae &s;pecies, partim &s;uis locis in&s;eran|tur, partim in appendice &s;eor&s;im exhibentur; cum indice et virium epitome.</HI>" 8^o. pp. 317.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>RAY.</HEAD>
<P>TO this period Mr. RAY had appear|ed to the public principally as a na|turali&s;t; but he now united to this charac|ter that of the theologi&s;t. It is needle&s;s to &s;ay, that he &s;ucceeded in this department, perhaps beyond mo&s;t of tho&s;e who had be|fore written on the &s;ame &s;ubject. His fir&s;t publication of this kind, we are told, was
<PB N="237" REF="256">
originally, and in its outlines, <HI>College Exer|ci&s;es</HI> only, or <HI>Common Places.</HI> The&s;e he now wrought up, and enlarged into a con|venient volume, and tru&s;ted it to the care of his friend, Dr. <HI>Tancred</HI> ROBINSON, who procured five hundred copies to be printed, under the following title: "THE WIS|DOM OF GOD MANIFESTED IN THE WORKS OF THE CREATION." 8^o. 1691. It was reprinted the next year. The ele|venth edition was publi&s;hed in 1743; and a twelfth in 1758; and, I believe, &s;everal times &s;ince: and it has been tran&s;lated into foreign languages. The&s;e are &s;ufficient te&s;|timonies of the e&s;teem with which it was received by the public.</P>
<P>It is not immediately within my plan to enlarge on this work, or to determine whe|ther the arguments <HI>&agrave; priori,</HI> or <HI>&agrave; po&s;teriori,</HI> are be&s;t calculated to obtain the object of it, "Demon&s;tration of the Being of a God." "<HI>Qui hi&s;toriam naturae, naturae etiam Creato|rem colit.</HI>" I may be allowed to ob&s;erve, that Mr. RAY, from that comprehen&s;ive view of nature which his mind embraced, was &s;ingu|larly well qualified to di&s;play the manifold
<PB N="238" REF="257">
wonders of the creation, and the wi&s;dom of its omnipotent Author. And thus, while his penetrating views enabled him to unfold the various oeconomy and evolutions of na|ture to the greate&s;t advantage, his piety and humility give a force to his rea&s;onings and deductions, that carries with it a conviction of that great truth he &s;o &s;incerely wi&s;hed to inculcate.</P>
<P>The favourable acceptance the public gave to the "Demon&s;tration," encouraged Mr. RAY to publi&s;h, the next year, his "THREE PHYSICO-THEOLOGICAL DIS|COURSES concerning the primitive Chaos, and Creation of the World. The general Deluge, its cau&s;es and effects. The Di&s;|&s;olution of the World, and future Confla|gration." 8^o. 1692. and 1693. 1713. pp. 456. 1721. 1732. It is embelli&s;hed with a plate of the <HI>Apamaean</HI> medal, and three tables of figured fo&s;&s;ils; and is dedi|cated to Archbi&s;hop TILLOTSON.</P>
<P>This work is a convincing proof of the exten&s;ive reading, the various erudition, and multifarious knowledge, of this great and good man. Independent of all the theories
<PB N="239" REF="258">
it contains, this volume exhibits &s;uch an a&s;&s;emblage of facts, relating to the &s;truc|ture of this globe, to the changes it has undergone, and to the hi&s;tory of figured fo&s;&s;ils, that it may be read to advantage, even in this age of advanced curio&s;ity, and knowledge in the profe&s;&s;ed object of this book. Even the fa&s;tidious critic, who is ver&s;ed in all the more modern theories, down to the "Epochas of Nature," and tho&s;e of <HI>M. De</HI> LUC, and <HI>De</HI> SOULAVIE, will allow that this volume, when re&s;pect is had to the time of its publication, mu&s;t have conveyed a large &s;hare of intelligence to tho&s;e who were capable of gratification from di&s;qui&s;itions of this nature; and that, with a deference to the opinions of the day, there is yet a freedom of enquiry that di&s;|tingui&s;hes the author, as a friend to true philo&s;ophy, and as a mode&s;t and candid en|quirer after truth, in tho&s;e points of natural hi&s;tory, which &s;till continue, and probably long will, to be involved in great ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>In this year, Mr. RAY wrote &s;ome "Ob&s;ervations on the Planting of <HI>Maize</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Pea&s;e,</HI>" occa&s;ioned by a pro|po&s;al
<PB N="240" REF="259">
of Sir <HI>Richard</HI> BULKLEY, in which he &s;ays, that he had found the greate&s;t yield of pea&s;e to be twenty barrels reaped for one &s;own; whereas, from one grain of <HI>Indian wheat,</HI> he had calculated the pro|duce would be upwards of 2000 grains for one. The&s;e Ob&s;ervations were printed in the <HI>Phil. Tran&s;.</HI> N^o 205. Mr. RAY was not &s;anguine in his expectations from the culture of that grain; neither have &s;ub&s;e|quent trials proved the utility of it in this climate.</P>
<P>The botanical labours of this eminent man were now remitted, at lea&s;t for &s;ome time; and we find, that after the publica|tion of his "<HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI>" and the "<HI>Synop&s;is,</HI>" his exertions were turned into another channel, in which he al&s;o &s;tood unrivalled in his day. It was not botany alone that he rai&s;ed from a drooping &s;tate; to zoo|logy, con&s;idered as a &s;cience, he might be &s;aid to have given birth, in the&s;e kingdoms; &s;ince, except what him&s;elf and Mr. WIL|LUGHBY had performed, nothing of im|portance on the hi&s;tory of animals exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>TOPSELL's "Abridgment of GESNER,"
<PB N="241" REF="260">
MOFFAT's "Book on In&s;ects;" and the &s;hort and imperfect e&s;&s;ays of CHARLETON, in his "<HI>Onoma&s;ticon,</HI>" and of MERRET, in his "<HI>Pinax,</HI>" were almo&s;t the only <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> writers to be con&s;ulted. To a&s;&s;ert that better helps were wanted, is not to injure, or to degrade tho&s;e authors. Mr. RAY had been urged by his friends, and particularly by Dr. ROBINSON, to undertake an entire FAUNA ANGLICA, and a hi&s;tory of <HI>Fo&s;|&s;ils</HI> al&s;o; but age and infirmities began now to oppre&s;s him, and he thought him&s;elf in|adequate to the attempt. He lived, how|ever, to perform more than his fears, or his humility permitted him to hope.</P>
<P>In 1693, he publi&s;hed his "SYNOPSIS METHODICA ANIMALIUM, QUADRUPE|DUM, <HI>et</HI> SERPENTINI GENERIS; <HI>vulgarium notas characteri&s;ticas, rariorum de&s;criptiones integras, exhibens: cum hi&s;toriis et ob&s;ervationi|bus anatomicis, perquam curio&s;is. Praemittun|tur nonnulla de animalium in genere, &s;en&s;u, gene|ratione, divi&s;ione, &amp;c.</HI>" Lond. 8^o. pp. 336.</P>
<P>In this volume we &s;ee the fir&s;t truly &s;y&s;|tematic arrangement of animals, &s;ince the days of ARISTOTLE; an arrangement which
<PB N="242" REF="261">
his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in the &s;ame line have equally applauded, and availed them&s;elves of. It is profe&s;&s;edly the ba&s;is of that method, by which the pre&s;ent eminent zoologi&s;t of this nation, has cho&s;en to convey his learned publications, and by which he has not le&s;s happily diffu&s;ed a ta&s;te for this &s;cience, than he has &s;ucce&s;sfully improved its &s;tore.</P>
<P>In treating on animals in general, intro|ductory to his work, he di&s;cu&s;&s;es &s;ome im|portant que&s;tions, which had not then cea&s;ed to agitate the philo&s;ophical world. He controverts, with extreme force of rea|&s;oning, the ideas of equivocal or &s;ponta|neous generation; the <HI>Lewenhoekian</HI> hypo|the&s;is; and that of all animals being created from eternity, and only latent in an in|volved &s;tate. I know not where the reader can &s;ee the&s;e que&s;tions di&s;cu&s;&s;ed with equal conci&s;ene&s;s and judgment united.</P>
<P>Mr. RAY's Di&s;tribution of Animals is not wholly founded, as to the grand divi&s;ions, on the <HI>Ari&s;totelian</HI> di&s;tinctions; though he admits many of them. It is not within my plan to enter on this &s;ubject; it is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that <HI>Quadrupeds</HI> here form two great
<PB N="243" REF="262">
divi&s;ions, as they are <HI>boofed</HI> or <HI>digitated;</HI> the former, as they are <HI>whole</HI> or cloven; the latter, as they are <HI>divided</HI> into more, or fewer claws; admitting al&s;o of &s;ubdivi&s;ions or <HI>genera,</HI> from the number of the claws, and in &s;ome, from the con&s;ideration of the teeth.</P>
<P>At the time when Mr. RAY lived, few people had acquired a ta&s;te for this kind of knowledge, and commerce had not lent her friendly aid, as in later times. What ani|mals came under his own in&s;pection, he has de&s;cribed with his accu&s;tomed accu|racy; from GESNER and ALDROVAND he borrows his de&s;criptions of others; and many later di&s;covered &s;ubjects he drew from PISO and MARCGRAAVE, from CLU|SIUS, HERNANDEZ, LAET, and NIEREM|BERG.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this work, he has, in va|rious in&s;tances, given the anatomical &s;truc|ture, from Dr. TYSON, from the "<HI>Pari&s;ian</HI> Di&s;&s;ections," and other works. Through|out the whole, he has &s;hewn how intimately he was acquainted with the learning of the ancients, and particularly with ARISTOTLE,
<PB N="244" REF="263">
whom, as the parent of zoological know|ledge, he failed not to con&s;ult on all oc|ca&s;ions, but by no means implicitly to fol|low, in his &s;ubtleties and ob&s;curities.</P>
<P>On fini&s;hing the "Synop&s;is of Quadru|peds," Mr. RAY immediately drew up that of the <HI>Birds</HI> and <HI>Fi&s;hes.</HI> This was an ea&s;ier ta&s;k at this time, &s;ince they are to be con&s;idered as compends of his preceding labours with his friend, Mr. WILLUGHBY; although there were many things new in both, and that of the Fi&s;hes was very greatly improved as to the arrangement and method. He informs us, that the addi|tions were, the <HI>Mexican</HI> birds, from HER|NANDEZ; &s;ome de&s;criptions of new &s;pecies, out of NIEUHOFF; MARTIN's Birds and Fi&s;hes of <HI>Greenland;</HI> SIBBALD's Whales; SLOANE's <HI>Jamaica</HI> Birds and Fi&s;hes; and &s;ome from the <HI>Leyden</HI> Catalogue, by Dr. ROBINSON.</P>
<P>In the&s;e branches of nature, Mr. RAY again appears as the parent of method. The accurate BRISSON regards RAY and WILLUGHBY, as the fir&s;t true &s;y&s;tematic writers on birds. The&s;e works were fini&s;hed
<PB N="245" REF="264">
in the year 1693 or 1694, as we learn from Mr. RAY's letters, and from the te&s;timony of his friend and neighbour, Mr. DALE. Yet, excellent as they were, &s;o &s;canty was the ta&s;te for natural hi&s;tory at this period, that the manu&s;cripts lay unpubli&s;hed in the book&s;ellers hands, till they were purcha&s;ed by Mr. INNYS, and prepared for the pre&s;s by Dr. DERHAM, who added the figures, and in&s;erted Mr. BUCKLEY's Birds from <HI>Madra&s;s,</HI> and Mr. JAGO's <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> Fi&s;hes. They were publi&s;hed in 1713, under the titles of "SYNOPSIS METHODICA AVI|UM." 8^o. pp. 198. t. 2; and "SYNOP|SIS METHODICA PISCIUM." 8^o. pp. 162. t. 1.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame year, 1693, Mr. RAY became the editor of a tran&s;lation of "Dr. RAU|WOLF's Travels." This phy&s;ician, who was the next after BELON, whom the love of natural hi&s;tory alone, led to travel into the ea&s;t, &s;pent the years 1573-4-5 in tra|ver&s;ing <HI>Syria, Me&s;opotamia, Pale&s;tine,</HI> and <HI>Aegypt,</HI> induced, as he tells us, by his de&s;ire to behold, in the native places, the plants of the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Arabian</HI> phy&s;icians.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="265">
His "Travels" having been publi&s;hed in 1583, in the <HI>German</HI> language, had hi|therto been locked up from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> reader. Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE having, how|ever, read them, was induced, in concert with Capt. HATTON, to procure a tran&s;la|tion of them, which was done by <HI>Nicholas</HI> STAPHORST. This ver&s;ion was put into Mr. RAY's hands, to revi&s;e and correct. He did more; he made a choice &s;election from other authors, who had made the &s;ame tour, BELON, ALPINUS, Sir <HI>George</HI> WHELER, &amp;c. and he drew up a Cata|logue of the more rare Plants of tho&s;e countries through which RAUWOLF tra|velled; and added li&s;ts of tho&s;e of <HI>Aegypt</HI> and <HI>Crete.</HI> From this circum&s;tance, the book has gone by the name of "RAY's COLLECTION OF TRAVELS;" and it was reprinted with his own "Ob&s;erva|tions," in 1738. RAUWOLF made an "<HI>Herbarium,</HI>" while in the ea&s;t; which, with his <HI>European</HI> plants, con&s;tituted four large volumes. The&s;e became the property of Queen <HI>Chri&s;tina,</HI> and afterwards, by her means probably, of <HI>I&s;aac</HI> VOSSIUS, who in|formed
<PB N="247" REF="266">
Capt. HATTON, that 400 <HI>l.</HI> &s;ter|ling had been offered for them. They were purcha&s;ed of his heirs by the univer&s;ity of <HI>Leyden;</HI> and the late Dr. <HI>Frederick</HI> GRO|NOVIUS con&s;tructed from them an elegant and learned "<HI>Flora Orientalis;</HI>" of which he much enhanced the value, by prefixing to it <HI>Melchier</HI> ADAMS's "Life of RAU|WOLF," with large additions of his own.</P>
<P>The "CATALOGUS STIRPIUM IN EX|TERIS REGIONIBUS OBSERVATARUM" being out of print, Mr. RAY was induced to give a new edition of it, with &s;uch large augmentations, as to make it a new work. He added from CLUSIUS, from the BAU|HINES, and other authors, a number of plants growing in tho&s;e regions through which he pa&s;&s;ed in his tour; and &s;o many catalogues from other authors, as to render it a tolerably complete li&s;t of all the <HI>Euro|pean</HI> plants, not natives of <HI>England.</HI> As it does not immediately re&s;pect <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> botany, it will be &s;ufficient to recite the title-page, from which its &s;cope may be under&s;tood:</P>
<P>"STIRPIUM EUROPAEARUM <HI>extra Bri|tannias</HI>

<P>In the preface to this work, Mr. RAY, for the fir&s;t time, entered into controver&s;y; having taken occa&s;ion to throw out &s;ome &s;trictures on the method of botany pub|li&s;hed by RIVINUS in 1690. It is not enough intere&s;ting at this day to dwell on the nature of it. It is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that our veteran in &s;cience was di&s;&s;atisfied with the <HI>German,</HI> for throwing the trees promi&s;cuou&s;ly into the cla&s;&s;es with other plants, and for breaking into the natural orders, for the &s;ake of agreement in the flower alone. In fact, RIVINUS's method being founded wholly on the flower, to
<PB N="249" REF="268">
which part RAY had paid but &s;mall regard, the &s;ources of controver&s;y were endle&s;s; &s;ince the fundamental principles of each were totally irreconcileable.</P>
<P>About this time Mr. RAY communica|ted "The Provincial Catalogues of Plants," printed at the end of each county, in the edition of "CAMBDEN's <HI>Britannia,</HI>" pub|li&s;hed in 1695 by Mr. GIBSON. His re|peated travels throughout mo&s;t parts of <HI>England,</HI> for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of inve&s;tigat|ing the &s;ubjects of nature, had enabled him to accompli&s;h more than had been done by any man before his time; and his unque&s;tionable &s;kill and accuracy, added an authenticity to the&s;e li&s;ts, which could not ea&s;ily have been derived from any other hand.</P>
<P>To the county of <HI>Cornwall</HI> Mr. RAY added many other particulars; which, how|ever, were not printed, probably becau&s;e the corre&s;ponding circum&s;tances could not be procured from other counties. The&s;e were, "Catalogues of the Sea Fi&s;h, and Sea Fowl, with the &s;ynonyms;" &s;ome account of two or three &s;orts of &s;tone dug there; of &s;ea &s;and, as manure; an account of the
<PB N="250" REF="269">
<HI>hurlers,</HI> and other &s;tones; and notices re|&s;pecting the manners and language of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>Such as are conver&s;ant with that &s;cience, which was the favourite object of Mr. RAY, mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that nothing could have happened more conducive to the revival and improvement of it at this juncture, than the circum&s;tance of its having been taken up by a man of &s;uch patient indu&s;try, capable at the &s;ame time of giving it all the em|belli&s;hments, and advantages that learning could afford. They will readily grant that his writings and example alone, added more vigour, and brought more di&s;ciples to this &s;chool of natural &s;cience in <HI>England,</HI> than all the exertions of foregoing writers.</P>
<P>I cannot confirm and illu&s;trate the truth of this po&s;ition more effectually, than by calling to the attention of the curious in this kind of knowledge, the va&s;t augmenta|tion it acquired, in the interval between the publication of Mr. RAY's "<HI>Catalogus Plantarum Angliae,</HI>" and that of the "<HI>Sy|nop&s;is;</HI>" and more e&s;pecially between the time of the fir&s;t and &s;econd edition of the
<PB N="251" REF="270">
latter work; during which, exclu&s;ive of the di&s;covery of many &s;ubjects, among what were called the <HI>more perfect</HI> plants, a new and very exten&s;ive field had been opened, by exciting attention to the <HI>le&s;s perfect</HI> (as they were then accounted) and minuter kinds of vegetables, the <HI>Fungi, Fuci, Mu&s;ci,</HI> and <HI>Algae,</HI> known now by the name of <HI>Cryptogamiae.</HI> During the fir&s;t of the&s;e periods, 250 &s;pecies had been added to the <HI>Engli&s;h Flora;</HI> and the acce&s;&s;ion in the la&s;t exceeded that number.</P>
<P>In no part of <HI>Europe</HI> had the &s;ame pro|gre&s;s been made in the inve&s;tigation of the&s;e hitherto much-neglected &s;ubjects, as in <HI>England,</HI> during the period above men|tioned. This is &s;ufficiently evinced by comparing the &s;econd edition of the "SY|NOPSIS" with the contemporary writings of foreign botani&s;ts.</P>
<P>This &s;econd edition of the "SYNOPSIS" was printed in 1696. 8^o. pp. 346. Mr. RAY him&s;elf had but a &s;mall &s;hare in the augmentations that were made to this edi|tion. His advancing years and infirmities prevented him from making excur&s;ions. His
<PB N="252" REF="271">
principal auxiliaries are mentioned in the preface; in which, additional to the names in the former "SYNOPSIS," we meet with tho&s;e of Mr. <HI>Edward</HI> LLHWYD, <HI>Walter</HI> MOYLE, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and Mr. <HI>William</HI> VERNON, fellow of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s College, <HI>Cambridge.</HI></P>
<P>To tho&s;e who are &s;en&s;ible of the obliga|tions which the &s;cience owes to Mr. RAY, it cannot but be grateful to read, with what &s;atisfaction the good man records, in this preface, the progre&s;s he had lived to &s;ee his favourite &s;tudy make in his own country, and with what delight he augurs and con|templates its future improvement. In the &s;pace of little more than twenty years, and under his own pen, he had &s;een the <HI>Engli&s;h Flora</HI> acquire an acce&s;&s;ion of up|wards of 500 new &s;ubjects. The "CA|TALOGUS PLANTARUM ANGLIAE" of 1670, containing about 1050, and the &s;econd edition of the "SYNOPSIS" in 1696, full 1600 &s;pecies; and, notwith|&s;tanding the&s;e have not all &s;tood the te&s;t of the di&s;criminating character of the pre&s;ent age, yet, in ju&s;tice to this great man, and his a&s;&s;ociates, it mu&s;t be acknowledged,

that the retrenchments are comparatively few.</P>
<P>With this edition of the "SYNOPSIS," was publi&s;hed the "DISSERTATIO DE VARIIS PLANTARUM METHODIS BRE|VIS;" in which Mr. RAY &s;hews, that the &s;eparation of plants into cla&s;&s;es and <HI>genera</HI> from the fructification alone, mu&s;t be a very gradual and progre&s;&s;ive affair; that it was not ea&s;y to exclude the habit from having a &s;hare in this di&s;tribution, &s;ince there were many plants that were &s;el|dom or never &s;een in flower by the early botani&s;ts. He al&s;o ob&s;erves, that number|le&s;s plants, which agree in the &s;tructure of the flower; differ materially in habit, and others <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI> And although his own method is principally founded on the fruit, yet he freely acknowledges its imperfections; but thinks the &s;ame objections hold again&s;t the flower; which he illu&s;trates by &s;hewing, in TOURNEFORT's &s;y&s;tem, the uncertainty of the bounds between the <HI>Flores infundi|buliformes, hypocrateriformes,</HI> and the <HI>caryo|phyllei.</HI> If Mr. RAY paid le&s;s regard to the flower than its importance &s;eemed to de|mand, it &s;eems rather to have ari&s;en from
<PB N="254" REF="273">
the principles of his method, than from his want of opportunities of examination, ow|ing to his di&s;tance from botanical gardens, as was alledged by his opponents; a cir|cum&s;tance, however, which he very feeling|ly laments in the preface to his "METHO|DUS," and el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>To this is annexed, "EPISTOLA <HI>de</HI> METHODO PLANTARUM <HI>viri clari&s;&s;imi D. A. Q. Rivini ad Raium, cum eju&s;dem re&s;pon|&s;oria, in qua D. Jo&s;. Pitton Tournefortii, M. D. Elementa Botanica tanguntur.</HI>"</P>
<P>On the method of RIVINUS, Mr. RAY, as was before noticed, had thrown out &s;ome &s;trictures in the preface to his "<HI>Sylloge,</HI>" which drew from that author the an&s;wer here publi&s;hed, and Mr. RAY's reply; in which our author takes occa&s;ion al&s;o to defend his method from the objections of TOURNEFORT, who had been unbecom|ingly &s;evere in &s;ome animadver&s;ions made in the "<HI>Elements of Botany,</HI>" publi&s;hed in 1694. TOURNEFORT, however, afterwards did ample ju&s;tice to the merits of our au|thor.</P>
<P>The modern botani&s;t &s;ees that all the&s;e controver&s;ies are become too little intere&s;t|ing
<PB N="255" REF="274">
to dwell upon at this time. The prin|ciples of the <HI>Corolli&s;tae,</HI> and the <HI>Fructi&s;tae,</HI> as LINNAEUS &s;tyles them, can never be a&s;&s;imilated, and all attempts to reduce the whole vegetable kingdom into natural cla&s;&s;es have hitherto failed.</P>
<P>In 1697, he wrote "Some Ob&s;ervations on the Poi&s;onous Effects of a Root eaten in&s;tead of Par&s;neps," &s;uppo&s;ed to have been that of the Hemlock; but of which Mr. RAY had &s;ome doubt, alledging, that it was more probably the <HI>Cicutaria vulgaris, (Chaerophyllum &s;ylve&s;tre,</HI> Lin.) See <HI>Phil. Tran&s;.</HI> N^o 231.

<P>In the year 1700, Mr. RAY publi&s;hed "A PERSUASIVE TO A HOLY LIFE, from the Happine&s;s which attends it both in this World and in the World to come." Lond. 8^o. Reprinted in 1719. pp. 126.

On the contrary, Mr. RAY, ever con&s;i&s;tent and rational, although he deduces his prin|cipal motives to the practice of virtue, as conducive to happine&s;s, even in this life, from the precepts of Chri&s;tianity; yet does not di&s;dain, particularly in treating on plea|&s;ure, on riches, and the advantages of tem|perance, to enforce his arguments by opi|nions and apophthegms from the writings of the philo&s;ophers and morali&s;ts of ancient <HI>Greece,</HI> and <HI>Rome.</HI></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>RAY.</HEAD>
<P>THE peaceable mind of Mr. RAY could not delight in the contentious field of controver&s;y; on the contrary, he regretted the occa&s;ions that drew him into it: yet were they not without u&s;e, &s;ince they unque&s;tionably &s;timulated him to pu|rify and correct his own <HI>Methodus.</HI> This he effected in the year 1698, although at this time much declined in his health, being afflicted with ulcers of the lower extremi|ties, the pain of which rendered his nights frequently &s;leeple&s;s, and wholly prevented him from making excur&s;ions to <HI>London,</HI> as he much de&s;ired, to examine the gardens and <HI>herbaria</HI> of the curious.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="277">
So &s;mall, however, was the demand for books in this &s;cience, at the entrance of this century, that the <HI>London</HI> book&s;ellers were unwilling to ri&s;k the printing of it: and it was finally &s;ent to <HI>Holland,</HI> and printed at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> under the care of Dr. HOT|TON, the botanical profe&s;&s;or at <HI>Leyden,</HI> who &s;upervi&s;ed the pre&s;s, and procured 1100 copies to be thrown off, under the title of "METHODUS PLANTARUM EMENDATA ET AUCTA: <HI>accedit Methodus Graminum, Juncorum, et Cyperorum &s;pecialis.</HI>" 8^o. pp. 202. 1703. Dr. HOTTON gave a further &s;anction to the &s;y&s;tem of his friend; he taught it in his lectures to the pupils of that univer&s;ity, and informed Mr. RAY of the good acceptance it met with on the continent, particularly in <HI>Italy.</HI> This vo|lume was reprinted at <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> in 1710, and at <HI>Tubingen</HI> in 1733.</P>
<P>In the preface he recapitulates his own progre&s;s in the formation of his &s;y&s;tem, and dates it from the tables drawn up in 1667 for the u&s;e of Bi&s;hop WILKINS. He very ju&s;tly reprehends Dr. MORISON, for affect|ing to have formed his method entirely
<PB N="259" REF="278">
from his own ob&s;ervations, without acknow|ledging the &s;malle&s;t aid from former wri|ters; briefly recites his objections to the methods of RIVINUS, TOURNEFORT, and HERMAN; and defends his own. He e&s;tab|li&s;hes &s;ome axioms, to be ob&s;erved in fram|ing a &s;y&s;tem of botany. In fact, Mr. RAY's method, though he a&s;&s;umes the fruit as the foundation, is an elaborate attempt, for that time, to fix natural cla&s;&s;es. He e&s;tabli&s;hes it as a rule, that no plant is to be &s;eparated from its tribe for a &s;ingle note of difference; but that all are to be a&s;&s;imilated, as far as habit will allow. The characters of the <HI>genera</HI> are, however, highly incongruous; they are taken from vague principles, &s;uch as the &s;hape of the leaf, colour of the flower, ta&s;te, &s;mell, and &s;ometimes from the &s;ize of the plant, and other as un&s;table di&s;tinctions.</P>
<P>In this amended edition, Mr. RAY &s;till adheres to the ancient divi&s;ion into trees and herbaceous plants, having dropped the di&s;tinction of &s;hrubs, pre&s;erved in the fir&s;t edition. Here, all herbaceous, and &s;hrubby|&s;talked plants are divided into twenty-five <HI>genera</HI> or cla&s;&s;es; as follow: <LIST>

<P>At this time, the con&s;ideration of Mr. RAY's method is a matter of mere curio|&s;ity; yet, in ju&s;tice to this great man, it mu&s;t be remarked, that his &s;y&s;tem, though le&s;s artificial than that of CAESALPINE, is
<PB N="262" REF="281">
much more highly elaborated than that of MORISON: and, though Mr. RAY mu&s;t have taken infinite pains with it, yet is it difficult in practice; &s;ince the ba&s;es of the cla&s;&s;es are not uniform. Of the thirty|three, however, twelve are nearly com|po&s;ed of natural orders. Such are the fol|lowing:<LIST>

<P>The remaining cla&s;&s;es are combined of &s;ubjects le&s;s connected by habit and &s;truc|ture; and are therefore &s;ubject to more ar|bitrary rules, drawn from the con&s;ideration of &s;ome one, or more parts, in the fructifi|tion.</P>
<P>In the "METHODUS <HI>Graminum, Junco|rum, et Cyperorum &s;pecialis,</HI>" annexed to this book, Mr. RAY's di&s;tribution re&s;ts princi|pally on what may be called the habit of the fructification; all tho&s;e <HI>genera,</HI> which
<PB N="263" REF="282">
in the <HI>Linnaean</HI> &s;y&s;tem are known by the names of <HI>Phalaris, Alopecurus, Dactylis, Agro&s;tis, Aia, Poa, Briza,</HI> &amp;c. being called <HI>Gramen</HI> &s;imply, with the epithets of the old authors annexed, expre&s;&s;ive of the mode of bearing the parts of the fructification, whe|ther in &s;pikes, or panicles; as, <HI>Gramen tri|ticeum; Gramen loliaceum; typhinum; Gra|men paniculatum; miliaceum,</HI> &amp;c. In this <HI>Con&s;pectus,</HI> however, all the &s;pecies are introduced, to the amount of two hun|dred.</P>
<P>Sixteen years had now elap&s;ed &s;ince the publication of his "Hi&s;tory of Plants;" in which interval botany had a&s;&s;umed a new face, and experienced a much greater revo|lution and acce&s;&s;ion, than had ever taken place before. Sy&s;tem had been &s;tudied, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure e&s;tabli&s;hed, both at home and abroad. An incredible number of new plants had been introduced, from all parts of the world, and cultivated with extreme care in the gardens of <HI>Europe.</HI> In the mean time, the&s;e circum&s;tances had given ri&s;e to a great number of valuable publi|cations. The remaining &s;ix volumes of
<PB N="264" REF="283">
that ine&s;timable work, the "HORTUS MALABARICUS," had appeared: BREY|NIUS, HERMAN, TOURNEFORT, PLU|MIER, PLUKENET, BOCCONE, COMME|LINE, BOBART, CUPANI, VOLKAMER, and RIVINUS, had enriched botany with valuable performances. The&s;e large aug|mentations to the &s;cience induced Mr. RAY, notwith&s;tanding his advanced years and ill health, to attempt a collection of the&s;e &s;cattered materials, in order to form a &s;upplemental volume to his "Hi&s;|tory;" and his indu&s;try enabled him to effect his purpo&s;e. Additional to the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ances derived from all the&s;e printed works, he had acce&s;s, by the favour of Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE, to the MS. of his "Hi&s;tory of <HI>Jamaica</HI> Plants" (of which the "<HI>Pro|dromus</HI>" had been publi&s;hed in 1696) with liberty to &s;elect what he thought proper to his de&s;ign.</P>
<P>From the &s;ame gentleman he enjoyed the benefit of an <HI>Herbarium</HI> of &s;everal hundred new and unde&s;cribed plants, collected in <HI>Ma|ryland,</HI> by Mr. VERNON and Mr. KREIG, who had made a voyage thither for the
<PB N="265" REF="284">
&s;ole purpo&s;e of gratifying their ta&s;te in bo|tany. Mr. PETIVER freely communicated his &s;tores, at that time very ample, though afterwards abundantly more &s;o; and Dr. SHERARD engaged, be&s;ides &s;upplying more than a thou&s;and &s;pecies him&s;elf, to take the trouble of in&s;pecting the whole work before it went to the pre&s;s, and of making &s;uch cor|rections and additions as he judged proper.</P>
<P>It was the la&s;t of his works publi&s;hed in his life-time, and came out in 1704, with the following title:</P>
<P>"HISTORIAE PLANTARUM TOMUS TERTIUS, <HI>qui e&s;t</HI> SUPPLEMENTUM <HI>duorum praecedentium; &s;pecies omnes, vel omi&s;&s;as, vel po&s;t volumina illa evulgata editas, praeter in|numeras fere novas et indictas ab amicis com|municatas, complectens: cum &s;ynonymis nece&s;&s;a|riis, et u&s;ibus in cibo, medicina, et mechanicis.</HI>" Lond. folio, pp. 666; and the "<HI>Dendro|logia,</HI>" pp. 135. App. pp. 137.</P>
<P>The di&s;tribution is the &s;ame as that of the two former volumes. In a compilation of this kind, collected from &s;o numerous a &s;et of authors, and in many in&s;tances from dried and imperfect &s;pecimens, there mu&s;t
<PB N="266" REF="285">
nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e a multitude of repeti|tions. The author was &s;ufficiently aware of this; but it was unavoidable. In this volume there are upwards of 11,700 plants enumerated.</P>
<P>The Appendix contains &s;everal catalogues, which mu&s;t have been intere&s;ting to the curious at that time. Father CAMELL, a learned Je&s;uit of <HI>Manila,</HI> who had not only de&s;cribed, but delineated, a great number of the plants of <HI>Luzone,</HI> tran&s;mitted his work to Mr. RAY; and it forms an exten&s;ive part of this Appendix. It mu&s;t have been much regretted, that the Rev. Father had not been furni&s;hed with books to have en|abled him to adapt the &s;ynonyms; &s;ince there are few in&s;tances in which any other names occur, than the <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> and the in|digenous appellations of the natives and <HI>Malays.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. RAY then gives a li&s;t of TOURNE|FORT's oriental di&s;coveries, from the "<HI>Co|rollarium;</HI>" tho&s;e of DAMPIER, from <HI>New Holland</HI> and el&s;ewhere, and of MARTENS's <HI>Greenland</HI> Plants; of COMMELINE's Rare Exotics; a copious Catalogue of <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI>
<PB N="267" REF="286">
<HI>Madra&s;s,</HI> and <HI>African</HI> Plants, communicated by Mr. PETIVER, of which, tho&s;e from <HI>Ma|dra&s;s</HI> had been collected by Mr. BROWNE, a &s;urgeon at that &s;ettlement; and la&s;tly, a li&s;t of the new, or hitherto very imperfectly de&s;cribed &s;pecies, contained in Mr. PETI|VER's <HI>Hortus Siccus,</HI> amounting to upwards of 800.</P>
<P>An adverti&s;ement had been printed at the end of the fir&s;t volume of Mr. RAY's "Hi&s;|tory," in 1688, inviting to a &s;ub&s;cription for a &s;et of figures to the work; and it was propo&s;ed, that tho&s;e belonging to each tribe or cla&s;s, &s;hould be publi&s;hed in regular &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion; but it did not &s;ucceed. The &s;cheme was again revived, while the Supplement was printing; and, among other of Mr. RAY's friends, Dr. COMPTON, bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> had given his patronage, and &s;trongly re|commended it. Conferences were held with Dr. SHERARD, Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE, Dr. RO|BINSON, and Mr. PETIVER, relating to it; but it was relinqui&s;hed as impracticable.</P>
<P>Mr. RAY's infirmities were very pre&s;&s;ing upon him during the later years of his life.
<PB N="268" REF="287">
In a letter, written in the &s;pring of 1702, he informs Mr. DERHAM that he had not been half a mile from his own hou&s;e for four years. Yet, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, he wrote his &s;upplemental volume to his "Hi&s;tory of Plants," which, he &s;ays, had engro&s;&s;ed almo&s;t his whole time for two years.</P>
<P>We have now brought Mr. RAY's bo|tanical works to a conclu&s;ion; but his la|bours did not cea&s;e here. His active and indefatigable mind prompted him, at the age of &s;eventy-five, to begin a work on <HI>In|&s;ects;</HI> to which he had been encouraged by Dr. DERHAM; and for which he had been accumulating materials during many years. This was intended to comprehend only the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;pecies; although, at the &s;ame time, his friends were wi&s;hing to engage him to de&s;cribe the exotics of the <HI>London Mu&s;ea,</HI> which were then beginning to abound in the&s;e &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>He had paid &s;ome attention to the hi&s;|tory of <HI>Spiders,</HI> indeed, many years be|fore, when intimately connected with Dr.
<PB N="269" REF="288">
LISTER; but the greater part of his work was drawn up from his own actual de&s;criptions, and partly from Mr. WIL|LUGHBY's papers, and the contributions of friends, Mr. PETIVER, Mr. DAN|DRIDGE, Dr. SLOANE, Mr. MORTON, and Mr. STONEFLEET.</P>
<P>He tells us, that in the later years of his life he had di&s;covered 300 kinds of <HI>Papilios,</HI> diurnal and nocturnal; and knew there were many more. The <HI>Beetles,</HI> he ob&s;erves, were as numerous, and the <HI>Flies</HI> not le&s;s &s;o. I mention the&s;e circum&s;tances to prove the exten&s;ive knowledge of nature which this extraordinary man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, at an aera when he &s;tood &s;o nearly alone in the&s;e branches of &s;cience. He did not live to fini&s;h this work. It was publi&s;hed by Dr. DERHAM in 1710, in 4^o. pp. 398.</P>
<P>I believe Mr. RAY was the fir&s;t who gave to the&s;e minuter animals a real and &s;cientific di&s;tribution. He had drawn up a &s;hort "METHODUS INSECTORUM," which was publi&s;hed the year after his death. Of the hi&s;tory it&s;elf, it is &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that it bears all the characters of that accurate,
<PB N="270" REF="289">
di&s;criminating, and &s;y&s;tematic genius, which guided him in all his re&s;earches in the field of nature; and that it is every where quoted by the eminent <HI>Swede</HI> with the highe&s;t commendations, for the faithful de&s;criptions it contains.</P>
<P>Mr. RAY's infirmities and afflictions, painful and grievous as they were, did not, we are told, prevent him from pro&s;ecuting his &s;tudies till within about three months before his death; which event took place on Jan. 17, 1704-5.</P>
<P>He died at <HI>Black Notley,</HI> and was buried, as Dr. DERHAM &s;ays, according to his own de&s;ire, in the church of that pari&s;h. The writers of the "General Dictionary," in the mean time, inform us, that, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"although the rector of the pari&s;h offered him a place of interment in the chancel of the church, yet he mode&s;tly refu&s;ed it, choo&s;ing rather to be buried in the church-yard with his ance&s;tors, where a monument was erected to him,"</Q> as Dr. DERHAM relates, at the charge of &s;ome of his friends, with a <HI>Latin</HI> in&s;cription; which may be &s;een in the "Ge|neral Dictionary," and in Mr. SCOTT's

<P>As Mr. RAY did not inherit any pater|nal e&s;tate, and had often refu&s;ed preferment, his circum&s;tances could never have been affluent; and the legacy of Mr. WILLUGH|BY is &s;aid to have been the greate&s;t part of what he enjoyed. His own e&s;tate, what|ever that might be, he &s;ettled on his wife.
<PB N="272" REF="291">
He had four daughters, three of whom &s;ur|vived him. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He left a &s;mall legacy to the poor of his own pari&s;h, and five pounds to Trinity College, in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> to pur|cha&s;e books for the library there. All his collections of natural curio&s;ities he

<P>Mr. RAY's po&s;thumous papers were en|tru&s;ted
<PB N="274" REF="293">
by his widow to the care of Dr. DER|HAM; who, after publi&s;hing the "HIS|TORIA INSECTORUM," &s;elected a number of his letters, and printed them, in 1718, under the title of "PHILOSOPHICAL LET|TERS between the learned Mr. RAY and &s;everal of his Corre&s;pondents, natives and foreigners." 8^o. pp. 367.</P>
<P>This collection contains 218 letters; of which, &s;ixty-eight were written by Mr. RAY him&s;elf. Among his corre&s;pondents, the mo&s;t frequent were Dr. LISTER, Sir <HI>Philip</HI> SKIPPON, Dr. <HI>Tancred</HI> ROBINSON, Sir <HI>Hans</HI> SLOANE, Mr. LLWYD, Mr. JES|SOP, Mr. JOHNSON, and Mr. OLDEN|BURGH. The fir&s;t of Mr. RAY's letters bears date in 1667, the la&s;t in 1705.</P>
<P>The corre&s;pondence of learned and &s;cien|tific men, &s;eldom fails to be a welcome pre|&s;ent to tho&s;e of &s;imilar literature and pur|&s;uits; for, be&s;ides the per&s;onal intere&s;t we take in their concerns, they commonly de|lineate, in the mo&s;t faithful colours, the characters of the writers, frequently a&s;cer|tain di&s;coveries, and enable their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to trace the progre&s;s of knowledge in a
<PB N="275" REF="294">
more intere&s;ting manner than by hi&s;torical detail.</P>
<P>As the general &s;ubject of the&s;e letters is natural hi&s;tory, &s;o botany bears a prevail|ing portion. Be&s;ides numberle&s;s critical ob&s;ervations that occur on particular &s;pe|cies, we meet with a long catalogue of the rare plants of the north of <HI>England,</HI> by Mr. LAWSON; Dr. PLUKENET's Ob&s;ervations on the fir&s;t edition of the "<HI>Synop&s;is;</HI>" tho&s;e of Dr. PRESTON on various <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Plants; a paper of <HI>Thomas</HI> WILLISEL's &s;pecifying the different kinds of trees, on which, in his travels, he had &s;een the <HI>Mi&s;|&s;eltoe</HI> growing; and a li&s;t of &s;uch exotics as were thought rare at that time in the <HI>Chel|&s;ea</HI> Garden, and at <HI>Fulham.</HI></P>
<P>There is, moreover, among the&s;e letters, an intere&s;ting paper, written by Mr. RAY him&s;elf, in an&s;wer to the que&s;tion, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What number of plants there are in the world?"</Q> in which he di&s;cu&s;&s;es the difficulty, or im|po&s;&s;ibility, of gaining &s;atisfaction on this point, ari&s;ing from the want of &s;ufficient bounds between &s;pecies and variety. He communicated to the Royal Society &s;ome
<PB N="276" REF="295">
remarks on this head, which were printed by Dr. BIRCH, in the third volume of the "Hi&s;tory of the Royal Society."</P>
<P>Dr. DERHAM meditated writing the life of Mr. RAY; but he appears not to have fully executed his plan. His papers, how|ever, were publi&s;hed by Mr. SCOTT, in 1760, under the title of "Select Remains of the learned <HI>John</HI> RAY." 8^o. pp. 336. To the&s;e are annexed three of the <HI>Itinera|ries,</HI> which con&s;titute the greater part of the book. They are evidently &s;hort notes only, never intended for the public eye. Some of Mr. RAY's devotional pieces ac|company this collection; and three letters to Dr. DERHAM; with a <HI>Latin</HI> letter of advice and in&s;tructions to his pupils, the Mr. WILLUGHBYS.</P>
<P>There is &s;aid to be &s;till extant a manu|&s;cript of Mr. RAY's, under the title of "<HI>Catalogus Plantarum dome&s;ticarum quae aluntur Catabrigiae in hortis academicorum et oppidanorum.</HI>" In this, he chiefly makes u&s;e of the <HI>&s;ynonyma</HI> of the two BAUHINES, and of GERARD and PARKINSON.</P>
<P>Mr. RAY had the &s;ingular happine&s;s of
<PB N="277" REF="296">
devoting fifty years of his life to the culti|vation of the &s;ciences he loved. Incited by the mo&s;t ardent genius, which overcame in|numerable difficulties and di&s;couragements, his labours were, in the end, crowned with a &s;ucce&s;s, before almo&s;t unequalled. He totally reformed the &s;tudies of botany and zoology; he rai&s;ed them to the dignity of a &s;cience, and placed them in an advan|tageous point of view; and, by his own inve&s;tigations, added more real improve|ment to them in <HI>England,</HI> than any of his predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>He invented and defined many terms, ex|pre&s;&s;ive of ideas before unknown to the na|turali&s;ts of <HI>England;</HI> and introduced many others, from writers of the be&s;t note. As he wrote <HI>Latin</HI> in great purity, and with great facility, he gave his &s;ubjects all the embelli&s;h|ments that learning could be&s;tow; and his exten&s;ive erudition, and knowledge of phi|lo&s;ophy at large, enabled him to add many collateral ornaments, and u&s;eful ob&s;erva|tions, with an aptitude and judgment that has been much applauded.</P>
<P>The extent of his improvements in &s;ci|ence procured him the admiration of his
<PB N="278" REF="297">
contemporaries, and have ju&s;tly tran&s;mitted his name to po&s;terity, among tho&s;e who have done honour to their age and country. Even learned foreigners have been eloquent in his prai&s;e. <HI>French</HI> writers have &s;tiled him the "<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> TOURNEFORT;" an eulogy that &s;ufficiently evinced the high opinion they had of his merit. And the late eminent HALLER not only attributes to RAY the merit of improving and eleva|ting botanical knowledge, but from his life dates a new aera in the records of the &s;ci|ence.</P>
<P>But Mr. RAY's enquiries were not limit|ed to natural knowledge. His Foreign Tra|vels and his Itineraries prove, that antiqui|ties, polity, government, and legi&s;lation, at|tracted a &s;hare of his regard; as his philo|logical books are evidences of his attention to language, and of his de&s;ire to improve and illu&s;trate his native tongue.</P>
<P>To all the&s;e endowments he joined an unremitting indu&s;try and per&s;everance in the pro&s;ecution of his &s;tudies; and, what marks a fortitude of mind as uncommon as it is enviable, his a&s;&s;iduity &s;eemed to &s;trengthen
<PB N="279" REF="298">
with his age, and to bid a defiance to the encroachments of infirmity, and the pro&s;|pect of di&s;&s;olution. I call to witne&s;s the magnitude of the attempt, and &s;ucce&s;sful i&s;&s;ue of his exertions, in writing the &s;upple|mental volume to his "Hi&s;tory of Plants," and in beginning the "<HI>Hi&s;toria In&s;ectorum</HI>" at &s;o late a period of his life.</P>
<P>His &s;ingular mode&s;ty, affability, and com|municative di&s;po&s;ition, &s;ecured to him the e&s;teem of all who knew him; and his emi|nent talents as a naturali&s;t and a philo&s;o|pher procured him many patrons and friends, and pre&s;erved him from that ob&s;curity, which would otherwi&s;e probably have been his lot: for, notwith&s;tanding his learning and probity, as his principles did not accord with tho&s;e of the times, they were adver&s;e to his fortune, and he gained no emoluments in the church. He had relinqui&s;hed his fellow&s;hip at the commencement of the <HI>Bar|tholomew</HI> act, not, as &s;ome imagined, from his having taken the <HI>Solemn League and Co|venant</HI> (for that he never did, and often de|clared, that he ever thought it an unlawful oath), but becau&s;e he could not declare,
<PB N="280" REF="299">
agreeably to the terms of the act, that the oath was not binding on tho&s;e who had taken it. Hence too, his con&s;tant refu&s;al of preferment afterwards, occa&s;ioned him to be ranked, by many, among the nonconfor|mi&s;ts, although he lived and died in the communion of the church of <HI>England.</HI> He had &s;een, with deep regret, the di&s;orders of the commonwealth and the u&s;urpation, and afterwards, not le&s;s, the threatening a&s;pect of the reign of <HI>James</HI> II.</P>
<P>His &s;trong attachment to the principles of civil and religious liberty, is manife&s;ted by his animated &s;tile, in the preface to his "<HI>Synop&s;is;</HI>" where he expre&s;&s;es, in glowing terms, his joy and gratitude, for having lived to &s;ee tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Revolution.</P>
<P>The character of Mr. RAY cannot be contemplated by tho&s;e who have a true re|li&s;h for the &s;tudies of nature, without a high &s;entiment of re&s;pect and gratitude; nor by tho&s;e who con&s;ider the exemplari|ne&s;s of his life as a man, and his qualifica|tions as a divine, without veneration.</P>
<P>There are two engraved portraits of Mr.
<PB N="281" REF="300">
RAY prefixed to his works, both from a painting by <HI>Faithorne;</HI> one by <HI>W. Elder,</HI> before his "SYLLOGE," in 1693, which &s;eems to have been copied for the "ME|THODUS EMENDATA," in 1703; and the other by <HI>Vertue,</HI> in 1713, prefixed to the "Phy&s;ico-theological Di&s;cour&s;es." In both the&s;e, he is repre&s;ented, as Mr. AMES de|&s;cribes it, in <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"an oval frame, with hair, whi&s;kers, band, and canonical habit."</Q> The&s;e engravings repre&s;ent Mr. RAY in the latter &s;tage of his life<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In dedicating plants to the worthies of botanical &s;ci|ence, the name of RAY challenged a dignified place; and the liberal-minded foreigner, who&s;e name has before occurred on the&s;e occa&s;ions, forgot not &s;o ju&s;t a tribute. PLUMIER called a new plant of the <HI>dioecious</HI> cla&s;s, which bears the habit of <HI>bryony,</HI> and is nearly allied to the <HI>yams,</HI> which he fir&s;t di&s;covered in the i&s;le of <HI>Domingo,</HI> by the name of JAN-RAJA, in honour of our illu&s;trious country|man. LINNAEUS, who had comparatively few opportuni|ties of correcting PLUMIER, e&s;tabli&s;hed the <HI>genus,</HI> but more aptly changed it to RAJANIA, and enumerates three &s;pecies. He could not adopt the &s;till more analogous term of RAIA, &s;ince it had long been preoccupied in the animal kingdom; and it had been ju&s;tly con&s;tituted an axiom, by the <HI>Fundamenta Botanica,</HI> N^o 230, not to form, in the vegetable kingdom, any generical terms, &s;ynonymous to &s;uch as were employed in zoology or mineralogy.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>COWLEY.</HEAD>
<P>IN all times, from VIRGIL and AEMI|LIUS MACER of the Augu&s;tan age, from the &s;purious MACER, and STRABUS the monk of <HI>St. Gall,</HI> in the twelfth cen|tury, to modern times, the beauties of flowers, and the virtues of plants, have been celebrated in ver&s;e. <HI>Marcus</HI> NAEVIANUS, fir&s;t a phy&s;ician, and then a prie&s;t, of <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> &s;ung the qualities of plants in his "<HI>Poemation</HI>" of 1563; and THUANUS, the great hi&s;torian, amu&s;ed him&s;elf with prai&s;ing the <HI>violet</HI> and the <HI>lily</HI> in metre. In our own country, in 1723, <HI>George</HI> KNOWLES de|&s;cribed 400 plants of the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> in <HI>Latin</HI> ver&s;e, and didactically applied them to their u&s;es in medicine.</P>
<P>But to proceed: That <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI>
<PB N="283" REF="302">
in the &s;ame age, might not want their bo|tanical laureats, COWLEY in the one, and RAPIN in the other, aro&s;e to celebrate this theme.</P>
<P>COWLEY, after having found rea&s;ons for &s;tudying phy&s;ic, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"con&s;idering botany," as we are told by his late eminent biographer, "as nece&s;&s;ary to a phy&s;ician, retired into <HI>Kent,</HI> to gather plants."</Q></P>
<P>Here, he wrote, before the Re&s;toration, his "Two fir&s;t Books on Plants;" although they were not publi&s;hed till the year 1662. The remaining four were added in the edi|tion of 1668; and the whole were repub|li&s;hed, with other poems, in 1678. 8^o. pp. 343.</P>
<P>In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> book, he celebrates the powers of various medicinal herbs, more e&s;pecially of tho&s;e which gave ampler &s;cope to his mu&s;e, from antient renown of their virtue, and were yet in frequent u&s;e, and high e&s;teem. Such were betony, wormwood, wa|ter lily, mi&s;&s;eltoe, and various others.</P>
<P>In the <HI>&s;econd,</HI> he invokes the godde&s;&s;es <HI>Luna, Lucina, Jana,</HI> and <HI>Mena;</HI> and &s;ings the prai&s;es of &s;imples appropriated to the
<PB N="284" REF="303">
di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;ex: in which, both antient &s;uper&s;tition, and modern belief, &s;upplied his mu&s;e with exuberant &s;ources of grati|fication.</P>
<P>In the <HI>third, Flora</HI> calls forth all his powers, in the narci&s;&s;us, the anemone, the violet, and the tulip, with a variety of other ornaments of the parterre, from the <HI>coro|nary</HI> tribe.</P>
<P>In the <HI>fourth,</HI> a more numerous &s;et of the &s;ubordinate embelli&s;hments of the gar|den are recorded, in various mea&s;ure; among which, the attributes of the moly, the lily, poppy, &s;unflower, &s;affron, and amaranth, attract his mu&s;e with more than ordinary attention.</P>
<P>In the <HI>fifth,</HI> he celebrates, in heroic mea|&s;ure, the gifts of <HI>Pomona,</HI> from the native products of <HI>England,</HI> to the date of the ea&s;t, and the <HI>tuna</HI> of the we&s;t; terminating his poem with near two hundred lines on <HI>Columbus,</HI> on the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> on the new continent, and in expre&s;&s;ing his hopes that, to the deva&s;tations of conque&s;t, will &s;oon &s;ucceed peace, religion, arts, and &s;cience.</P>
<P>In the <HI>la&s;t,</HI> he di&s;plays the &s;ylvan &s;cene,
<PB N="285" REF="304">
from the oak of <HI>Bo&s;cobel,</HI> to the lowly juni|per; and, having con&s;tituted his druidical monarch the &s;overeign of the fore&s;t, he makes him the oracle for a train of reflec|tions, on the u&s;urpation; the exile of <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, his re&s;toration; and the <HI>Dutch</HI> war.</P>
<P>His poems are accompanied by notes, illu&s;trating the etymology, the names, &s;yno|nyms, de&s;criptions, faculties, and u&s;es of the plants, confirmed by authorities drawn from cla&s;&s;ical, botanical, and medical wri|ters. Of the&s;e, he profe&s;&s;es in his preface, that PLINY among the antients, and FER|NELIUS among the moderns, have been his chief re&s;ources. Of botanical authors, GE|RARD and PARKINSON are &s;paringly men|tioned, and they are the principal of that cla&s;s.</P>
<P>Great eminence in &s;cience is &s;eldom at|tainable, unle&s;s its foundation be laid in a devotedne&s;s of mind to its object, in the early &s;cene of life. COWLEY did not enter on the &s;tudy of phy&s;ic, till the middle age of man; and then, as is probable, not with intere&s;ted views towards practice. Hence
<PB N="286" REF="305">
it may fairly be pre&s;umed, that he &s;atisfied him&s;elf with moderate acqui&s;ition. What was true of the whole, may by fair analogy be applicable to a particular branch of it. He had doubtle&s;s that portion of knowledge in the <HI>materia medica</HI> of plants, which may be con&s;idered as adequate to the u&s;ual de|mand.</P>
<P>But, that COWLEY, in his retirement, &s;hould obtain an exten&s;ive and critical know|ledge of botany, as it &s;tood as a &s;cience, even in his day, could not be expected. His fervid genius could &s;carcely &s;toop to that patient inve&s;tigation of nature, by which alone it could be acquired. Neither do the text, nor the notes, manife&s;t &s;ufficient proof of his intimate acquaintance with tho&s;e au|thors of true &s;ame, among the moderns, through who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance the want of that information might, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, have been &s;upplied.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, as, in the language of Dr. JOHNSON, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Botany, in the mind of COW|LEY, turned into poetry,"</Q> to tho&s;e who are alike enamoured with the charms of both, the poems of COWLEY mu&s;t yield
<PB N="287" REF="306">
delight; &s;ince his fertile imagination has adorned his &s;ubject with all the beautiful allu&s;ions that antient poets and mythologi&s;ts could &s;upply; and even the fancies of the modern <HI>Signatores,</HI> of BAPTISTA PORTA, CROLLIUS, and their di&s;ciples, who &s;aw the virtues of plants in the phy&s;iognomy, or agreement in colour or external forms, with the parts of the human body, a&s;&s;i&s;ted to embelli&s;h his ver&s;e. Nor did he fail, by the&s;e elegant productions, to honour his &s;ubject, his name, and his country.</P>
<P>I clo&s;e the&s;e ob&s;ervations by remarking, that poetry, as it ever hath, &s;o it ever mu&s;t derive from nature &s;ome of its mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;cenes of entertainment. In the vegetable world, the mo&s;t expanded imagination of poetic genius will, even without the aid of fiction, &s;o emphatically &s;tiled the &s;oul of poetry, find a field &s;ufficiently ample for the di&s;play of the brighte&s;t talents. THOM|SON witne&s;&s;es this truth, while in him we lament the want of that botanical know|ledge, without which, the poet mu&s;t ever be deprived of numberle&s;s &s;ources of the
<PB N="288" REF="307">
mo&s;t beautiful imagery, and &s;uch as would add peculiar grace, and the mo&s;t in&s;tructive power to his mu&s;e.</P>
<P>And, although the talent of the poet hath not often been united to that of the really &s;cientific botani&s;t, there are not want|ing in&s;tances of this union. I might men|tion, &s;ince the di&s;covery of the &s;exes of plants, the ode, dedicated to CAMERARIUS, and printed in his "<HI>Epi&s;tola de Sexu Plan|tarum;</HI>" of which, a tran&s;lation by Dr. MARTYN, when a young man, may be &s;een in BLAIR's "Botanick E&s;&s;ays." Profe&s;&s;or <HI>Van</HI> ROYEN, in 1732, publi&s;hed an elegant poem "<HI>De Plantarum Amoribus, et Connu|biis.</HI>" And CUNO, an ingenious merchant of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> in a volume of 256 pages, de&s;cribed, in 1750, the plants of his own garden in ver&s;e; for which he received the laurel from LINNAEUS, by a new genus in|&s;cribed to his name.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I am now writing, I have the plea&s;ure of congratulating all tho&s;e, who&s;e love of poetry is aided by a ta&s;te for botani|cal &s;cience, on a mo&s;t elegant production in
<PB N="289" REF="308">
our own country. The beautiful di&s;play of the principles of the <HI>Linnaean</HI> &s;y&s;tem in the "Botanic Garden," under the delicate analogy of the "Loves of the Plants," in which the didactic de&s;ign of the author, is &s;o happily embelli&s;hed by <HI>Ovidian</HI> imagery, as to have given that energy and ornament to the &s;ubject, which has been hitherto wanting to all &s;imilar productions in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> language.</P>

<P>The publication which entitles Dr. <HI>Mer|ret</HI> to a place in the&s;e anecdotes, is, his "PINAX RERUM NATURALIUM BRI|TANNICARUM, <HI>continens</HI> VEGETABILIA, <HI>Animalia, et Fo&s;&s;ilia, in hac In&s;ula reperta.</HI>" 8^o. 1667. pp. 223.</P>
<P>This is not noticed in the title as a &s;e|cond edition, although there is one recorded by authors, with the date of 1665. How|ever, I &s;u&s;pect it to be a mi&s;take, as no &s;uch edition is quoted by RAY. He dates his book from the College of Phy&s;icians, and is mentioned by MORISON under the title of "<HI>Mu&s;ei Herbiani Cu&s;tos.</HI>"</P>
<P>Dr. MERRET informs us, that he under|took this work at the reque&s;t of a book|&s;eller, to &s;upply the deficiencies of How's "<HI>Phytologia,</HI>" after that work was out of print; and that it was intended to have been done jointly with Dr. DALE, who&s;e death, &s;oon after the de&s;ign was formed,
<PB N="292" REF="311">
threw the whole into his own hands. He &s;ays, he had purcha&s;ed 800 figures, which JOHNSON had cau&s;ed to be engraved, with which the work was to have been embel|li&s;hed. Why they did not appear, no cau&s;e is a&s;&s;igned; nor do I find any further no|tices of them. Dr. MERRET, though un|que&s;tionably a man of learning, ta&s;te, and con&s;iderable information in natural hi&s;tory, &s;eems to have engaged in it too late in life, to admit of his making that proficiency, which the de&s;ign required. Add to this, that being fixed in <HI>London,</HI> and clo&s;ely en|gaged in the practice of his profe&s;&s;ion, he was rendered incapable of inve&s;tigating plants, in the di&s;tant parts of the kingdom. He however engaged <HI>Thomas</HI> WILLISEL to travel for him; and he tells us, that WIL|LISEL was employed by him for five &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive &s;ummers. His &s;on, <HI>Chri&s;topher</HI> MER|RET, al&s;o made excur&s;ions for the &s;ame purpo&s;e; and Mr. <HI>Yauldon</HI> GOODYER fur|ni&s;hed him with the manu&s;cripts of his grandfather. By the&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tances Dr. MER|RET procured a large number of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> plants, and a knowledge of the <HI>Loci Natales.</HI>
<PB N="293" REF="312">
Neverthele&s;s, he was not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that critical and intimate acquaintance with the &s;ubject, which might have enabled him to di&s;tingui&s;h, with &s;ufficient accuracy, the &s;pecies from varieties. He ranges the plants alphabetically, according to the <HI>Latin</HI> names, and has given few &s;ynonyms, except tho&s;e of GERARD and PARKINSON; to which, after the example of the writers of the "<HI>Hortus Oxonien&s;is,</HI>" he has very commen|dably annexed the page. He gives the ge|neral places of growth, and &s;pecifies the particular &s;pots, where the rare plants are found.</P>
<P>At the end of the Catalogue, is &s;ubjoined, a rude di&s;po&s;ition of vegetables into cla&s;&s;es, &s;omewhat like that of <HI>John</HI> BAUHINE. This he hoped to have improved, again&s;t the time of a &s;econd edition, which, pro|bably, Mr. RAY's publications &s;uper&s;eded. Then follows a brief <HI>Synop&s;is Etymologica,</HI> and a u&s;eful li&s;t of the plants as they flower in each month, pointing out the duration of the time. Dr. MERRET has, in this <HI>Pi|nax,</HI> introduced many plants as new, which, on &s;ub&s;equent examination, proved to be
<PB N="294" REF="313">
only varieties; a number of exotics, evidently the accidental offspring of gardens, and many that could never be met with by &s;ucceeding botani&s;ts, in the places &s;pecified by him. He enumerates upwards of 1400 &s;pecies of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> plants; whil&s;t the accu|rate Mr. RAY, only three years afterwards, confines the number to 1050. Neverthe|le&s;s, &s;everal <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> plants make their fir&s;t appearance in this <HI>Pinax;</HI> and Dr. MER|RET would probably have &s;ecured his title to &s;ome others, if he had not totally omitted to give de&s;criptions of tho&s;e which he in|troduces as new.</P>
<P>The zoological part of this <HI>Pinax</HI> is ex|extremely &s;uperficial; con&s;i&s;ting merely of the <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> name, with a refer|ence to ALDROVANDUS, GESNER, JOHN|STON, and MOUFFETT. The mineralogy is not le&s;s brief, and imperfect.</P>
<P>Before the publication of this work, Dr. MERRET had printed "A Collection of Acts of Parliament, Charters, Trials at Law, and Judges Opinions, concerning tho&s;e Grants to the College of Phy&s;i|cians." 4^o. 1660. This became the ba|&s;is,

<HEAD>MORISON.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ROBERT</HI> MORISON was born at <HI>Aber|deen,</HI> in 1620; was educated in the &s;ame univer&s;ity; and, in 1638, took the de|gree of doctor in philo&s;ophy, equivalent to that of M.A. He fir&s;t applied to mathe|matics, and was de&s;igned by his parents for the theological line; but his ta&s;te for bo|tany and phy&s;ic &s;uper&s;eded their intentions. His attachment to the royal cau&s;e, led him into the army; and he received a dangerous wound in the head, in the battle at <HI>Brigg,</HI>
<PB N="299" REF="318">
near <HI>Aberdeen.</HI> Upon his recovery, he went to <HI>Paris,</HI> the a&s;ylum of his countrymen. Here he was fir&s;t employed as a tutor to the &s;on of a coun&s;ellor, <HI>Bizet;</HI> and, in the mean time, a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly applied to the &s;tudy of anatomy, botany, and zoology. In 1648, he took the doctor's degree in phy&s;ic at <HI>Angers.</HI> He became &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed by his &s;kill in botany, that at the recom|mendation of M. ROBINS, the king's bota|ni&s;t, he was taken into the patronage of the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> uncle to <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. and appointed intendant of his fine garden at <HI>Blois,</HI> with a hand&s;ome &s;alary. This e&s;tab|li&s;hment took place in 1650, and he held it until the death of the Duke, in 1660. Here, we are told, MORISON laid open to the Duke his method of botany; and was liberally encouraged by him to pro&s;ecute it. The Duke al&s;o &s;ent him into various pro|vinces of <HI>France,</HI> to &s;earch for new plants. He travelled into <HI>Burgundy,</HI> the <HI>Lyonnois,</HI> and <HI>Languedoc;</HI> and into <HI>Britanny,</HI> the coa&s;ts and i&s;les of which he carefully inve&s;tigated; and, by the&s;e journies, enriched the garden with many rare, and &s;ome new plants.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="319">
It was in this &s;ituation that he became known to <HI>Charles</HI> II. who, in 1660, on the death of his uncle the Duke, invited MO|RISON into <HI>England;</HI> and, although &s;olicited by the trea&s;urer <HI>Fouquet,</HI> on the mo&s;t ho|nourable and ample conditions, to remain in <HI>France,</HI> the love of his country overcame all temptations, and he returned to <HI>Eng|land. Charles</HI> II. gave him the title of king's phy&s;ician, and royal profe&s;&s;or of bo|tany, with an appointment of 200 l. a year, and a hou&s;e, as &s;uperintendant of the royal gardens. He was elected fellow of the Royal College of Phy&s;icians, and acquired much fame for his knowledge of botany. In this &s;ituation he remained till the year 1669, when, having made an acquaintance with Mr. <HI>Obadiah</HI> WALKER, of Univer&s;ity College, with the Dean of Chri&s;t Church, and other leading men of the univer&s;ity, he was, by their intere&s;t, elected botanic profe&s;&s;or at Oxford, Dec. 16, 1669, and incorporated doctor of phy&s;ic the day fol|lowing. He read his fir&s;t lecture in the phy&s;ic &s;chool in September 1670, and then removed to the phy&s;ic garden, where he
<PB N="301" REF="320">
lectured three times a week, to a con&s;ider|able audience. In this occupation, and in conducting his great work, the "<HI>Hi&s;toria Plantarum Oxonien&s;is,</HI>" he laboured to the time of his death, which was thought to have been occa&s;ioned by a brui&s;e, received by the pole of a coach, in cro&s;&s;ing the &s;treet, Nov. 9, 1683. He died at his hou&s;e in <HI>Green-&s;treet, Leice&s;ter Fields,</HI> the next day, and was buried in the church of <HI>St. Mar|tin's in the Fields, We&s;tmin&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>SEGUIER &s;eems to have placed impro|perly among MORISON's works the fir&s;t edition of the "<HI>Hortus Ble&s;en&s;is,</HI>" which he gives as publi&s;hed in the year 1635, when MORISON mu&s;t have been only fifteen years of age. This may have been a typographi|cal error; but the book, in fact, was the work of <HI>Abel</HI> BRUYNER, phy&s;ician to the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> and was not publi&s;hed till 1653. MORISON's fir&s;t publication was a &s;econd edition of this catalogue, under the following title: "HORTUS REGIUS BLE|SENSIS <HI>auctus: acce&s;&s;it Index Plantarum in Horto contentarum nemini Scriptarum et</HI>
<PB N="302" REF="321">
<HI>Ob&s;ervationes generaliores, &s;eu Praeludiorum pars prior.</HI>" Lond. 1669. 12^o.</P>
<P>The "HORTUS BLESENSIS" rai&s;ed the author's character, and contributed, as the writer of his life ob&s;erves, to recommend him to the &s;tation he afterwards held at <HI>Oxford.</HI> It contains the rudiments of his method of cla&s;&s;ification. He profe&s;&s;es to give a li&s;t of 260 new plants; but many of them proved to be only varieties, and others, &s;uch as were well known before. There were, neverthele&s;s, &s;ome new and rare plants, of exotic, as well as indigenous origin; the latter, &s;uch as he had him&s;elf fir&s;t di&s;co|vered in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>In this work is al&s;o given his "HALLU|CINATIONES <HI>in</HI> CASPARI BAUHINI <HI>Pina|cem, tam in digerendis quam denominandis Plantis; et his Animadver&s;iones, in tres To|mos, Hi&s;toriae Plantarum</HI> JOHANNIS BAU|HINI;" a work which <HI>Haller</HI> calls "<HI>Invi|dio&s;um Opus;</HI>" and which, while it proves both the accuracy and diligence of the au|thor, mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed to be unbecomingly &s;evere on the&s;e two illu&s;trious writers; who,
<PB N="303" REF="322">
as they did not profe&s;s to write a &s;y&s;tem, are here too rigidly tried by rules, not in|vented when they wrote, and of con&s;e|quence the validity of which they could not have acknowledged.</P>
<P>In a dialogue at the end of the "<HI>Hortus Ble&s;en&s;is,</HI>" MORISON teaches, that the ge|nera of plants &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed on cha|racters drawn from the fruit, and not on any &s;en&s;ible qualities, or &s;uppo&s;ed medicinal virtue. He al&s;o learnedly defends the doc|trine, that all vegetables ari&s;e from &s;eed; a propo&s;ition not univer&s;ally allowed; the doctrine of equivocal, or &s;pontaneous gene|ration, having, at that time, many advo|cates among the learned.</P>
<P>Dr. MORISON, during his re&s;idence in <HI>France,</HI> in his occa&s;ional journies to <HI>Paris,</HI> about the year 1658, became familiar in the family of Lord HATTON, then re&s;ident at <HI>St. Germains,</HI> and who&s;e &s;econd &s;on <HI>Charles</HI> was much attached to natural hi&s;tory, and became a voluntary and zealous di&s;ciple of our author. Sixteen years afterwards, Mr. <HI>Charles</HI> HATTON &s;ent over, at the author's reque&s;t, a treati&s;e, with the plates already en|graved,
<PB N="304" REF="323">
written by <HI>Paul</HI> BOCCONE, on plants, di&s;covered by him in the &s;outhern parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> principally in <HI>Sicily,</HI> of which &s;ome were rare, and &s;ome new. BOCCONE was ori|ginally of <HI>Savona,</HI> in the <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> di&s;trict; and was born in 1633. He became a <HI>Ci&s;tertian</HI> monk of <HI>Palermo,</HI> and was a man of &s;ingu|lar and various erudition in natural hi&s;tory. He vi&s;ited <HI>Cor&s;ica</HI> and <HI>Malta;</HI> travelled into <HI>England, Holland,</HI> and <HI>Germany;</HI> and was for &s;ome time botani&s;t to the Duke of <HI>Tu&s;|cany.</HI> He was the author of &s;everal very curious works; and died in 1704. He wrote on fo&s;&s;ils; but his botanical writings have greater originality, and were of high value. MORISON, after having cau&s;ed the &s;even la&s;t plates to be re-engraved, pub|li&s;hed the work alluded to above, under the following title:</P>
<P>"ICONES <HI>et</HI> DESCRIPTIONES RARIO|RUM PLANTARUM <HI>Melitae, Galliae, et Ita|liae. Auctore Paulo</HI> BOCCONE, <HI>panormitano &s;iculo, &s;ereni&s;&s;imi magni Etruriae Ducis olim Botanico.</HI>" Oxon. 1674. 4^o. pp. 96. t. 52. fig. 119.</P>
<P>MORISON prefixed to this work a dedi|cation
<PB N="305" REF="324">
to Mr. HATTON, in which he de|fends, not only the doctrine in general, that all plants &s;pring from &s;eed, but particularly, again&s;t DIOSCORIDES, and &s;ome of the re|&s;torers of &s;cience, among whom were CAE|SALPINUS, that all the ferns are furni&s;hed with flowers and &s;eed.</P>
<P>The plants de&s;cribed and figured in this book, are, mo&s;t of them, &s;uch as had not been noticed by foregoing authors. A few of the&s;e are common to <HI>Britain.</HI> The figures are &s;mall, and neither well deline|ated, nor well engraven: but the work had its u&s;e, as containing &s;ome plants of Sou|thern <HI>Europe,</HI> not to be met with in any other author; and on this account derives &s;ome value, to tho&s;e who are curious in pur&s;uing the hi&s;tory of plants in the &s;exual &s;y&s;tem, as being quoted by LINNAEUS.</P>
<P>As a &s;pecimen of his great work, medi|tated under the name of "<HI>Hi&s;toria Planta|rum Univer&s;alis Oxonien&s;is,</HI>" MORISON next publi&s;hed, "PLANTARUM UMBELLIFE|RARUM DISTRIBUTIO NOVA, <HI>per tabulas cognationis et affinitatis, ex libro Naturae ob&s;ervata et detecta.</HI>" Oxon. 1672. fol.
<PB N="306" REF="325">
pp. 91. t. 12. The umbelliferous tribe is here divided into nine orders, the genera of which are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the figure of the &s;eed, a&s;&s;i&s;ted, in &s;ome of the &s;ubdivi&s;ions, by the form of the leaf. They are illu&s;tra|ted by figures of 150 different &s;eeds.</P>
<P>The author has &s;ubjoined what he names <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Umbelliferous Plants, improperly &s;o cal|led."</Q> Such are <HI>Valeriana, Thalictrum, Filipendula, Valeriana graeca, Pimpinella San|gui&s;orba;</HI> all which are very different, both in character and habit, except the <HI>Valerian,</HI> from the natural cla&s;s of which he treats.</P>
<P>This &s;pecimen excited the attention of the learned, augmented MORISON's patro|nage, both abroad and at home; and en|couraged him to pro&s;ecute with vigour his great work, of which the fir&s;t volume came out under the following title: "PLANTA|RUM HISTORIAE UNIVERSALIS OXONI|ENSIS, <HI>Pars &s;ecunda; &s;eu Herbarum Di&s;tri|butio nova, per tabulas cognationis et affinita|tis, ex libro Naturae ob&s;ervata et detecta.</HI>" Fol. 1680. pp. 617. The fir&s;t part of the Hi&s;tory, on Trees and Shrubs, was never printed. Some have doubted, whether it
<PB N="307" REF="326">
was ever written; but SCHELHAMMER<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In additamentis ad CONRINGIUM.</NOTE> tells us, that he &s;aw the whole work perfect in the hands of the author. MORISON him|&s;elf a&s;&s;igns, as a rea&s;on for publi&s;hing the Herbaceous Divi&s;ion fir&s;t, the greater mag|nitude of the undertaking, ari&s;ing from the va&s;t number, and con&s;equent difficulty of finding proper di&s;tinctions and characters; and becau&s;e he was unwilling to leave the mo&s;t difficult and ab&s;tru&s;e part of his work behind him unfini&s;hed, as happened to DE|LECHAMP, and <HI>John</HI> BAUHINE. Unhap|pily, however, MORISON's untimely death &s;ubjected his work to the &s;ame lot, and did not allow him to fini&s;h more than nine, out of the fifteen cla&s;&s;es of his own &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>He divides all herbaceous plants into fif|teen cla&s;&s;es, under the following titles:<LIST>

<P>From an in&s;pection of this table, it ap|pears, that his method is not uniformly founded on the fruit; in fact, much le&s;s &s;o than that of CAESALPINUS; but on the fruit and the habit conjointly; &s;ince the <HI>Corymbiferae, Umbelliferae,</HI> and <HI>Galeatae,</HI> with the <HI>Verticillatae,</HI> ari&s;e from the di&s;po&s;ition of the flower; the <HI>Scandentes, Culmiferae,</HI> and <HI>Capillares,</HI> from the habit: the &s;eventh cla&s;s from the qualities partly, and partly from the &s;eed. Hence we &s;ee, that only half the cla&s;&s;es are founded on the fruit; the fifteenth being truly an heteroclite a&s;&s;emblage. His method would have ap|proached much nearer to perfection, on his own principles, had he enlarged the num|ber of his cla&s;&s;es; &s;ince, in &s;everal in&s;tances, they embrace natural orders, much too di&s;|tinct to be ranged together. The orders, or &s;ubdivi&s;ions of the cla&s;&s;es, are, in &s;ome in&s;tances, grounded on differences in the
<PB N="309" REF="328">
&s;eed-ve&s;&s;el; in others, on the root, habit, and frequently on le&s;s &s;cientific di&s;crimina|tions. In the conduct of the work it&s;elf, MORISON makes a &s;eparate chapter for each genus. He begins by referring to the antients under each plant; frequently &s;ub|joining the etymology. The generical cha|racters, if indeed they can be &s;o called, are very vague; and though taken from the parts of fructification, are, too often, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by di&s;tinctions from the root, leaves, and mode of growth. After the generical note, follows a &s;ynoptical table of the &s;pecies, re|ferring to the plates. The de&s;criptions are &s;ometimes borrowed from <HI>John</HI> BAUHINE and others. To mo&s;t of the plants, he af|fixes new &s;pecific characters, and &s;ubjoins the <HI>&s;ynonyma</HI> of &s;everal authors. He intro|duces, at the end of the chapters, the ani|madver&s;ions on the BAUHINES, and an ac|count of the virtues and u&s;es of the plants.</P>
<P>The five fir&s;t cla&s;&s;es only, were publi&s;hed by the author, who left the four &s;ucceeding ones fini&s;hed. The&s;e, with the remaining cla&s;&s;es, were fini&s;hed and publi&s;hed, after an interval of nineteen years, by <HI>Jacob</HI> BO|BART.

MORISON had the advantage of powerful patronage. He was liberally en|couraged by the univer&s;ity, and enabled to embelli&s;h his work with a numerous &s;et of tables, on which are engraven about 3384 plants. The figures are chiefly co|pied from other authors. The new figures occur principally in the latter part of this work, and are therefore to be attributed to the care of BOBART. The &s;ix tables of <HI>Mo&s;&s;es, Fuci, Corallines,</HI> and <HI>Corals,</HI> at the end, are, except the few wooden cuts of GE|RARD, the fir&s;t of the kind graved in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and have great merit as the produc|tions of that time. All tho&s;e of COLUMNA and CORNUTUS are copied in this work. Tho&s;e engraved by <HI>Burghers</HI> excel the re&s;t; and the figures of the gra&s;&s;es and mo&s;&s;es are incomparably beyond any other that are to be met with, on the &s;ame &s;cale; the habit being admirably well expre&s;&s;ed. The re|publication of the&s;e tables, with references to LINNAEUS's writings, would, even at this period, be a benefit to the &s;cience.</P>
<P>The third part, or, more properly, the &s;econd volume of the "Oxford Hi&s;tory of

Plants," was publi&s;hed by <HI>Jacob</HI> BO|BART, in fol. 1699. pp. 655. A life of MORISON is prefixed to this volume, and an engraving of him done by <HI>White,</HI> with Dr. PITCAIRN's Tetra&s;tic underneath. In the preface, which is &s;igned <HI>Jacob</HI> BO|BART, the reader is pre&s;ented with a gene|ral view of the writers on botany, from THEOPHRASTUS, to the time of MORI|SON; enumerating throughout the &s;everal nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> in a chronological order, the mo&s;t learned authors on the &s;ubject. The writer then informs us of the patronage and encouragement which MORISON received from the univer&s;ity, to undertake this work; and, after lamenting the untimely death of the author, and expre&s;&s;ing his grateful &s;en&s;e of the honour he received in being ap|pointed to continue the undertaking, he lays before the reader the a&s;&s;i&s;tances he received in the pro&s;ecution of it. An interval of near twenty years had given BOBART an opportunity of in&s;erting a great number of plants unknown to MORISON, from the works of RAY, HERMAN, PLUKENET, the "<HI>Hortus Malabaricus,</HI>" and other works.

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>METHOD.</HEAD>
<P>AGREEABLY to my purpo&s;e, I now proceed to give a conci&s;e ac|count of the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of what is under&s;tood by <HI>method, &s;y&s;tem,</HI> or <HI>cla&s;&s;ification</HI> of plants, ari&s;ing from agreement in the parts of fructification, independent of any a&s;&s;ociation from the <HI>&s;acies externa,</HI> or habit of the plant. To this, I &s;hall add as brief an hi&s;tory of another important di&s;covery, that of the <HI>&s;exes of plants;</HI> in con&s;equence of which, &s;y&s;tem it&s;elf has been carried to a much higher degree of perfection.</P>
<P>There are no traces of what the moderns
<PB N="315" REF="334">
call <HI>&s;y&s;tem,</HI> in the writings of the antients; by whom are pre-eminently &s;ignified, THEO|PHRASTUS, DIOSCORIDES, and PLINY. Their knowledge of vegetables was con|fined to a few that were u&s;ed in medicine, and in the arts and conveniences of life; and in treating on them, their &s;ubjects are placed in great and inordinate divi&s;ions, without the &s;malle&s;t approach to what is now meant by <HI>cla&s;&s;i&s;ication.</HI></P>
<P>THEOPHRASTUS treats his &s;ubject, in general, philo&s;ophically. In his book "<HI>De Cau&s;is Plantarum,</HI>" he con&s;iders the propa|gation, culture, qualities, and u&s;es of Plants in general; but de&s;cribes very few. In his "<HI>Hi&s;toria Plantarum,</HI>" in which are de|&s;cribed, or enumerated, about 500 &s;pecies, he begins with the organization, the gene|ration, and propagation of Vegetables. He then treats largely, in his <HI>third</HI> and <HI>fourth</HI> books, on Trees. In the <HI>fifth,</HI> on Timber, and the choice of the be&s;t. In the <HI>&s;ixth,</HI> on Shrubs, thorny Plants, Ro&s;es, and other ornaments of gardens. In the <HI>&s;eventh,</HI> on oleraceous Plants, and wild Plants. In the <HI>eighth,</HI> copiou&s;ly on Grain of all kinds.
<PB N="316" REF="335">
And in the <HI>la&s;t,</HI> on Gums, Exudations, and the methods of obtaining them.</P>
<P>The object of DIOSCORIDES being &s;olely the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> he di&s;cu&s;&s;es each &s;ub|ject &s;pecifically, and in a &s;eparate chapter, dividing the whole into five books; in which, as far as any order takes place, they arrange into aromatic, alimentary, and medicinal plants. His de&s;criptions are taken chiefly from colour, &s;ize, mode of growing, com|pari&s;on of the leaves and roots, with other plants well known, and therefore left unde|&s;cribed. In general they are &s;hort, and fre|quently in&s;ufficient to determine the &s;pecies. Hence aro&s;e the endle&s;s, and irreconcileable contentions, among the commentators. In this manner he has de&s;cribed near 700 plants; to which he &s;ubjoins the virtues and u&s;es. To DIOSCORIDES all po&s;terity have appealed as deci&s;ive on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>PLINY, who treats of plants from the twelfth to the twenty-&s;eventh book, inclu|&s;ive, of his "Hi&s;tory," has drawn his re|&s;ources principally from Grecian authors. He is the hi&s;torian of antient botany, and recites the names of &s;everal hundreds, not
<PB N="317" REF="336">
mentioned by foregoing writers; but many of the&s;e are unknown. There is no &s;cien|tific order in the di&s;po&s;ition of his &s;ub|ject; and the great value of PLINY's work con&s;i&s;ts in having pre&s;erved to us the re|mains of antient knowledge on the &s;ubject; and in particular, the application of it to the arts of life, in tho&s;e remote times.</P>
<P>After the revival of learning in the fif|teenth century, the fir&s;t cultivators of bo|tany &s;tudied plants more in the writings of the&s;e fathers, than in the book of nature; and were &s;olely anxious about extricating the plants of the <HI>Materia Medica;</HI> &s;carcely adverting to tho&s;e &s;triking di&s;criminations in the general port, mein, or habit, the mode of growing, and other obvious rela|tions, which mark the great natural fami|lies in the vegetable kingdom: but were con|tent to arrange them, &s;ome, according to the alphabetical nomenclature, others, from the &s;tructure of the root, the time of flowering, the places of growth, the &s;uppo&s;ed qualities, and u&s;es in medicine; or from other as un|&s;table di&s;tinctions. With them, as with the antients, there were nearly as many <HI>ge|nera</HI>
<PB N="318" REF="337">
as <HI>&s;pecies;</HI> and if they gave the &s;ame common appellation to two, or more plants, they were led to it by &s;ome rude, external re&s;emblance; &s;uch as, &s;ize, form of the root, agreement in the colour of the flower; and, in the de&s;cription of the &s;pecies, were fre|quently &s;atisfied with comparing it to an|other plant well known to them&s;elves, and therefore left unde&s;cribed in their writings.</P>
<P>This mode of arrangement, though in a &s;omewhat improved &s;tate, is exemplified above, in the order ob&s;erved by DODONAEUS; and is &s;een in our old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> herbali&s;ts, GERARD and PARKINSON.</P>
<P>LOBEL, in his <HI>Adver&s;aria,</HI> 1570, &s;eems to have been the fir&s;t, who attempted to di&s;|tribute plants into large families, or cla&s;&s;es, from the general con&s;ent of habit, or exter|nal form, and mode of growing. This he has done in an imperfect &s;ynoptical way; and &s;everal of his families contain natural orders, or cla&s;&s;es, nearly entire; but fre|quently interrupted by great anomalies. His arrangement was not &s;ufficiently attended to at the time: it was then excellent, and was gradually improved, until we &s;ee it in
<PB N="319" REF="338">
its la&s;t, and be&s;t form, as exhibited by <HI>Ca&s;par</HI> BAUHINE, in his <HI>Pinax,</HI> 1623; and e&s;pecially by <HI>John</HI> BAUHINE, in his <HI>Hi&s;to|ria Plantarum Univer&s;alis,</HI> 1650.</P>
<P>As natural characters aro&s;e from &s;imila|rity in the general port, or habit of the plant, and from an obvious agreement in the di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;talk, leaves, &s;tems, and from that of the flower, fruit, and &s;eed; &s;o, they at length forced them&s;elves to ob|&s;ervation. Thus, the general habit of all <HI>gra&s;&s;es;</HI> the plants with a <HI>papilionaceous</HI> flower, &s;uch as pea&s;e and vetches; the <HI>&s;ili|quo&s;e</HI> plants, &s;uch as mu&s;tard, cre&s;&s;es, tur|neps, &amp;c.; the <HI>verticillated,</HI> as mint, baum, hy&s;&s;op, germander, &amp;c.; the <HI>umbellated</HI> tribe, par&s;ley, carrots, hemlock, angelica; the <HI>cone-bearing trees;</HI> and &s;everal other tribes, were too &s;triking, not to be &s;een even by a &s;uperficial ob&s;erver. But, as the&s;e con&s;titute only a part of the whole, &s;o no characters were formed for tho&s;e plants, which the eye could not immediately refer to &s;ome of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es. Still le&s;s had any generical agreement, ari&s;ing from uniformity in the fructification, been detected. Had all the &s;pecies of plants arranged them&s;elves under
<PB N="320" REF="339">
natural cla&s;&s;es, a natural method would ea&s;ily have followed; but the intermediate links, notwith&s;tanding the efforts of the mo&s;t &s;kilful, are yet unknown. Hence aro&s;e the nece&s;&s;ity of artificial &s;y&s;tems, which are now become but too numerous. Some have imagined, that the more pure any artificial &s;y&s;tem pre&s;erves the natural cla&s;&s;es, the greater is its excellence; but experience does not confirm this idea. Tho&s;e arrange|ments are found to lead more immediately to the plant &s;ought for, the cla&s;&s;es and &s;ubdivi&s;ions of which are &s;imple, and drawn each uniformly from the &s;ame parts of the fructification.</P>
<P><HI>Conrad</HI> GESNER, the LINNAEUS of the age in which he lived, is univer&s;ally agreed to have been the fir&s;t who &s;ugge&s;ted this true principle of cla&s;&s;ical di&s;tinction, and generical character, as is manife&s;t from va|rious pa&s;&s;ages in the <HI>Epi&s;tles</HI> of that great man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;t. Medicinal. &agrave; <HI>Wolphio</HI> ed. p. 113, et pa&s;&s;im.</NOTE>. He in&s;tances the agreement of the <HI>Staphi&s;agria,</HI> with the <HI>Con&s;olida;</HI> the <HI>Scor|zonera,</HI> with the <HI>Tragopogon;</HI> the <HI>Molucca,</HI> with the <HI>Lamium;</HI> the <HI>Dulcamara,</HI> with
<PB N="321" REF="340">
the <HI>Solanum;</HI> the <HI>Calceolus,</HI> with the <HI>Orchi|des:</HI> and he expre&s;sly &s;ays, that the charac|ter &s;hould be formed from the flower, and the &s;eed, rather than from the leaves. This was in the year 1565. Other pa&s;&s;ages occur, by which it appears, he had the &s;ame ideas &s;o early as 1559. But, perhaps, there is no proof of the importance he gave to the&s;e parts, more indubitable, than his having been the fir&s;t who delineated them &s;epa|rately, with the figures of his plants; of which numerous in&s;tances may be &s;een in the tables publi&s;hed by SCHMIEDEL.</P>
<P>But GESNER did not live to improve the hints he thus drew from nature; and, what is wonderful, they were neglected by tho&s;e great luminaries of the &s;cience, CLUSIUS, and the BAUHINES. It was re&s;erved for CAESALPINUS, a man in whom was united an exqui&s;ite knowledge of plants, with a truly philo&s;ophical genius. He had been the di&s;ciple of GHINUS, and was afterwards phy&s;ician to Pope <HI>Clement</HI> VIII. He de|&s;cribed, with exqui&s;ite &s;kill, the plants of his own country, and left an <HI>Herbarium</HI> of
<PB N="322" REF="341">
768 &s;pecies. He extended GESNER's idea, and commenced the period of &s;y&s;tematic arrangement. In his "<HI>Libri xvi de Plan|tis,</HI>" publi&s;hed 1583, he has arranged up|wards of 800 plants into <HI>cla&s;&s;es,</HI> founded, after the general divi&s;ion of the trees from herbs, on characters drawn from the fruit particularly, from the number of the cap|&s;ules and cells; the number, &s;hape, and di&s;|po&s;ition of the &s;eeds; and from the &s;ituation of the <HI>corculum, radicle,</HI> or eye of the &s;eed, which he rai&s;ed to great e&s;timation. The <HI>orders,</HI> or &s;ubdivi&s;ions, are formed on &s;till more various relations.</P>
<P><HI>Fabius</HI> COLUMNA improved this doctrine of <HI>cla&s;&s;ification,</HI> in 1616, by extending it to the formation of <HI>genera,</HI> which CAESALPI|NUS had not effected; all his &s;pecies being &s;eparately de&s;cribed. COLUMNA, indeed, did not exhibit a &s;y&s;tem; but he &s;hewed the way to complete it, by the union of &s;pecies under one common name, from &s;imilarity in the flower, and fruit; and he invented &s;everal of the terms, now in u&s;e, to deno|minate tho&s;e parts. This noble invention,
<PB N="323" REF="342">
neverthele&s;s, lay dormant for near a cen|tury; and the glory of reviving, and im|proving it, was re&s;erved for <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>RAY, and MORISON, both laboured in it at the &s;ame time; and with them mu&s;t commence the aera of &s;y&s;tematic botany in <HI>England.</HI> It was an object thought worth contending for, and each of the&s;e writers had their partizans, who re&s;pectively be|&s;towed the laurel, as they were led by their various motives, or attachments. I &s;hall not enter into the merits of their claims, further than to ob&s;erve, that both &s;eem to have turned their attention to the &s;ubject, nearly about the &s;ame time, and that Mr. RAY had certainly priority in point of publication, if it may be allowed, that the tables which he drew up for Bi&s;hop WIL|KINS's "Real or Univer&s;al Character," which was publi&s;hed in 1668, contain the outlines of a &s;y&s;tem. And, certainly, the&s;e rudiments, though ha&s;tily done, as Mr. RAY confe&s;&s;es, &s;ufficiently prove that he had be|&s;towed no &s;mall attention on the &s;ubject. That foreign writers have more commonly attributed to MORISON the revival of me|thod,
<PB N="324" REF="343">
may have ari&s;en from their being le&s;s acquainted with Bi&s;hop WILKINS's work, which was extant only in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> tongue. Mr. RAY informs us, in the &s;econd edition of his <HI>Catalogus Plantarum Angliae,</HI> that Dr. WILKINS meditated a tran&s;lation of his "Univer&s;al Character" into <HI>Latin,</HI> with figures, for the u&s;e of foreigners; and Mr. RAY him&s;elf performed it: but the death of this good prelate, in 1672, prevented the completion of the de&s;ign. He adds, that his Method, in a more elaborate &s;tate, had been delivered into the Bi&s;hop's hands, for the above-mentioned work.</P>
<P>Dr. MORISON exhibited the outlines of his &s;cheme in the "<HI>Hortus Ble&s;en&s;is,</HI>" the year after the publication of the Bi&s;hop's book, and exemplified it in his "Hi&s;tory of Plants," in 1680. Mr. RAY did not de|tail his till the year 1682, in the "<HI>Metho|dus,</HI>" in which he freely acknowledges the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he received from CAESALPINUS, COLUMNA, JUNGIUS, and even from MO|RISON's work. On the contrary, Dr. MORISON a&s;&s;umes to him&s;elf the merit of having drawn all his re&s;ources, in the fa|brication
<PB N="325" REF="344">
of his &s;y&s;tem, wholly from na|ture, and his own ob&s;ervations; pre&s;erving every where the utmo&s;t &s;ilence, re&s;pecting any a&s;&s;i&s;tance derived from former writers. A&s;&s;umptions, which could with difficulty be acceded to, and which drew upon him the cen&s;ures of TOURNEFORT, and other ma&s;ters of the &s;cience; who were well ac|quainted with the fountains of knowledge that were then open to him, and the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ances he mu&s;t have drawn from GESNER, CAESALPINUS, and others.</P>
<P>At this di&s;tance of time, and under the pre&s;ent enlightened &s;tate of &s;cience, the &s;y&s;|tems of RAY, and of MORISON, mu&s;t not be &s;crupulou&s;ly examined. CAESALPINUS laid a foundation-&s;tone, on which, if our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> architects rai&s;ed a <HI>Gothic</HI> &s;tructure, their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors have improved it to a &s;tyle of greater &s;ymmetry, and elegance.</P>
<P>The introduction of <HI>&s;y&s;tem</HI> was fortunate for &s;cience, as it brought with it, by de|grees, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of generical cha|racters, on a like a&s;&s;emblage of e&s;&s;ential parts in &s;everal &s;pecies. As new plants
<PB N="326" REF="345">
were daily di&s;covered in the old continent, and were pouring in from the new, the nomenclature of botany was in danger of being again overwhelmed, with that chaos in which <HI>Ca&s;par</HI> BAUHINE found it, when he reduced it into &s;ome order, by his la|borious and incomparable <HI>Pinax.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> enabled botani&s;ts to refer new &s;pe|cies to <HI>genera</HI> already formed, and re&s;trained that licence before taken, of giving a new generical appellation to each new plant: for, although in the multitude of methods which followed this di&s;covery, plants of the &s;ame genus, in one &s;y&s;tem, were frequently referable to a different genus in another; yet, with this inconvenience annexed, they were more readily inve&s;tigated, than under the vague di&s;tinctions of the older writers.</P>
<P>The re&s;toration of <HI>&s;y&s;tem,</HI> was, in the words of LINNAEUS, the beginning of the golden age of botany; and the revival of it having taken place in <HI>England,</HI> pre&s;ently rai&s;ed up &s;everal learned men among us, who gave new life and vigour to the whole &s;ci|ence. The names of SLOANE, PLUKE|NET,
<PB N="327" REF="346">
SHERARD, and PETIVER, will ever remain illu&s;trious in the annals of botanic knowledge.</P>
<P>It al&s;o turned the attention of the learned on the continent to the &s;ubject. Rival &s;y&s;|tems were &s;oon con&s;tructed; &s;ome on the <HI>fruit,</HI> as the ba&s;is of the cla&s;&s;es, in confor|mity to the &s;y&s;tems of CAESALPINUS, RAY, and MORISON; and others, on the <HI>flower.</HI> Thus, <HI>Chri&s;topher</HI> KNAUT, in 1687, and HERMAN, in 1690, fixed on the <HI>fruit;</HI> who&s;e &s;y&s;tems were improved by BOER|HAAVE, in 1710.</P>

<HEAD>SEX OF PLANTS.</HEAD>
<P>TO the revival and e&s;tabli&s;hment of <HI>method,</HI> &s;ucceeded a di&s;covery of the highe&s;t importance to botanical &s;cience; I mean, what is, with great ju&s;tice, called analogically, The doctrine of the <HI>&s;exes</HI> of plants; or, the knowledge that, throughout the vegetable kingdom, the influence of the du&s;t of the <HI>antherae,</HI> upon the <HI>&s;tigma,</HI> was nece&s;&s;ary in order to produce fertile &s;eed. By the e&s;tabli&s;hment of this fact, not only the phy&s;iology of vegetables was greatly advanced, but, in the end, practical botany equally improved; &s;ince, on this foundation has been built that &s;y&s;tem of the great
<PB N="330" REF="349">
<HI>Swede,</HI> which is now &s;o univer&s;ally followed. Of the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of this inve&s;tigation, I proceed to give a conci&s;e account, before I pur&s;ue the &s;ketch of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> authors.</P>
<P>A vague and indeci&s;ive opinion concern|ing the <HI>&s;exes</HI> of plants, prevailed among the antient philo&s;ophers of <HI>Greece.</HI> We are in|formed by ARISTOTLE, that EMPEDO|CLES particularly taught, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the &s;exes were united in plants."</Q> This opinion was a natural con&s;equence of the doctrine which this philo&s;opher, in common with ANAXAGORAS, DEMOCRITUS, and PLA|TO taught, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that plants were &s;entient and animated beings."</Q> This idea has met with ingenious advocates among the mo|derns, who have been induced to favour it, not only from the general analogy exi&s;ting between animals and vegetables, and the difficulty of fixing the limits between them, but from the more &s;triking in&s;tances of ap|parent irritability, and obedience to the action of certain <HI>&s;timuli:</HI> &s;uch are, the gene|ral affection plants have for light; the rota|tory motion of many towards the &s;un; the faculty of others in clo&s;ing the leaves
<PB N="331" REF="350">
at night, called, not unaptly, the <HI>&s;leep of plants;</HI> and the opening and &s;hutting of many flowers, at &s;tated times, with equal propriety denominated <HI>vigiliae florum;</HI> the ri&s;ing of the flower of aquatic plants out of the water, every morning during the &s;tate of flore&s;cence, as in&s;tanced in the <HI>Nym|phaea,</HI> and &s;till more &s;ignally in the <HI>Valli&s;|neria.</HI> To the&s;e may be added the more remarkable examples in the <HI>Mimo&s;a,</HI> and <HI>Oxalis &s;en&s;itiva,</HI> in the <HI>Dionaea mu&s;cipula,</HI> the <HI>Dro&s;era</HI> and the <HI>Hedy&s;arum gyrans,</HI> and finally, in the exqui&s;ite irritability of the <HI>&s;tamina,</HI> and <HI>antherae,</HI> in various &s;pecies. EMPEDOCLES, nevertherle&s;s, though he maintained the doctrine of the <HI>&s;exes,</HI> does not attempt to confirm it by any facts, or rea&s;onings deduced from the knowledge of the u&s;es of the &s;eparate parts in flowers, but from analogical deduction, founded merely on his general doctrine.</P>
<P>ARISTOTLE, or rather the author of the <HI>Books on Plants,</HI> which bear his name, com|bats the opinions of EMPEDOCLES, and his followers, re&s;pecting the &s;entient and ani|mated principle in vegetables; yet it is evi|dent
<PB N="332" REF="351">
he had him&s;elf no deci&s;ive ideas, or &s;pecific knowledge, drawn from nature, re|lating to the <HI>&s;ex</HI> of plants. He placed it, in &s;ome in&s;tances, in the different habit alone, or in other di&s;criminations foreign to the con&s;ideration of the flower; and, though he &s;hews an inaccurate knowledge of the particular circum&s;tances of the palm, and the fig-tree, yet he denies, in another place, that either of them produce flowers.</P>
<P>This imperfect idea of the <HI>&s;ex</HI> of flowers, in the <HI>Date,</HI> and even in the <HI>Fig-tree,</HI> is of high antiquity; being recorded by HERO|DOTUS, THEOPHRASTUS, and PLINY. The nece&s;&s;ity which the antient cultiva|tors of the <HI>Date-tree</HI> were under, of pro|moting the action of the male-flowers on the female, which operation held al&s;o in &s;ome mea&s;ure in the <HI>Fig-tree,</HI> the <HI>Pi&s;tachia,</HI> and the <HI>Ma&s;tic,</HI> would almo&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;ugge&s;t the application of this analogy with the animal kingdom. Neverthele&s;s, although the fact was thus obtruded on their &s;en&s;es, inatten|tive to the &s;tructure of flowers, and igno|rant of the offices of the &s;everal parts, they remained unacquainted with the true ope|rations
<PB N="333" REF="352">
of nature in this phaenomenon, though daily pre&s;ent to their ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The antient fathers of botany, and par|ticularly DIOSCORIDES, it is true, applied the di&s;tinction of male and female to many other plants; but it was entirely without regard to true analogy, or di&s;crimination of functions in the flower. It was frequently applied to &s;uch as carry all the parts of the flower within the &s;ame <HI>calyx,</HI> or on the &s;ame &s;talk; on account of &s;tature; greater de|gree of fertility; or other marks uncon|nected with the fructification. In the <HI>diae|cious,</HI> or &s;uch as have the <HI>&s;tamina,</HI> and <HI>pi&s;|tils,</HI> on &s;eparate plants of the &s;ame &s;pecies, the real male plant was, in &s;ome ca&s;es, de|nominated the female; of which the <HI>Mer|curialis</HI> may be mentioned as one in&s;tance, among &s;everal others.</P>

<P>This doctrine of the &s;exual analogy be|tween plants and animals, made but little progre&s;s with the <HI>literati</HI> in botany, upon the revival of &s;cience; &s;ince the fir&s;t of tho&s;e who mention it, is CAESALPINUS. This critical and learned author notices male and female plants in the <HI>Oxycedrus,</HI>
<PB N="335" REF="354">
<HI>Taxus, Mercurialis, Urtica,</HI> and <HI>Cannabis;</HI> of which he &s;ays, the barren plants are males, and the fertile females; adding, that the latter, as is ob&s;erved in the <HI>Date-tree,</HI> becomes more fruitful by being planted near the males; from thence receiving a genial <HI>effluvium,</HI> which excites a &s;tronger fertility. From this ob&s;ervation, it may almo&s;t be inferred, that he had in&s;tituted experiments on &s;ome of the&s;e kinds; but we do not find that he carried the idea be|yond the above-mentioned &s;pecies, to vege|tables in general.</P>
<P><HI>Adam</HI> ZALUZIANSKY, a <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> writer in 1592, is &s;aid, by &s;ome, to have di&s;tin|gui&s;hed the <HI>&s;exes</HI> of plants. I have not &s;een his book; but, from what is found relating to his opinion in other writers, I conjecture that his ob&s;ervations, if not wholly taken from CAESALPINUS, do not exhibit any original matter on this &s;ubject. In fact, no further progre&s;s was made for near an hundred years after this time; and the ho|nour of the di&s;covery, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that this &s;exual pro|ce&s;s was univer&s;al in the vegetable king|dom, and that the du&s;t of the <HI>antherae</HI>
<PB N="336" REF="355">
was endowed with an impregnating power,"</Q> is due to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Whether the true idea of this proce&s;s originated with Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> MILLINGTON, to whom it has been a&s;cribed, may ju&s;tly admit of a doubt; &s;ince Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> has left no written te&s;timony on the &s;ubject; and Dr. GREW's mention of him does not im|ply that he actually received the idea from him. Add to this, that Mr. RAY, in the &s;ummary view of all GREW's di&s;coveries, which he has prefixed to his "Hi&s;tory of Plants," does not once mention Sir <HI>Tho|mas</HI> MILLINGTON's name. Intere&s;ted as we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e Mr. RAY to have been, in every di&s;covery relating to vegetables, and candid as he was in his general con|duct to the learned, it is not likely that he &s;hould have failed, in this in&s;tance, to ren|der prai&s;e where it was &s;o ju&s;tly due. When we further recollect, that Dr. GREW had been &s;ome years engaged in tho&s;e micro|&s;copical experiments, on the anatomy of plants, which have rendered his name e&s;ti|mable with all po&s;terity, that whil&s;t he was thus employed in &s;tudying &s;o intimately
<PB N="337" REF="356">
the organization of vegetables, and had ob|&s;erved, that in what&s;oever parts the flower might be deficient, the attire, (or <HI>&s;tamina,</HI> and <HI>apices</HI>) is ever pre&s;ent, it is not &s;trange that the true idea of its u&s;e &s;hould have been &s;ugge&s;ted to him.</P>
<P>Dr. GREW laid his opinion before the Royal Society, in a lecture on the anatomy of flowers, read Nov. 6, 1676; in which he maintained, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the primary and chief u&s;e (of the du&s;t of the <HI>apices</HI>) is &s;uch as has re&s;pect to the plant it&s;elf, and &s;o appears to be very great and ne|ce&s;&s;ary: becau&s;e even tho&s;e plants which have no flower, or foliature, are yet &s;ome way or other <HI>attired,</HI> &s;o that it &s;eems to perform its &s;ervice to the &s;eed as the fo|liature to the fruit. In di&s;cour&s;e hereof with our learned <HI>Savilian</HI> profe&s;&s;or, Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> MILLINGTON, he told me, that he conceived that the <HI>attire</HI> doth &s;erve as the male for the generation of the &s;eed. I immediately replied, that I was of the &s;ame opinion, gave him &s;ome rea|&s;ons for it, and an&s;wered &s;ome objections that might oppo&s;e them."</Q> He then ex|plains
<PB N="338" REF="357">
him&s;elf farther, and advances, that this foecundating power was not effected by the actual admi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>farina</HI> into the &s;eed-ve&s;&s;el, but by means <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"of &s;ubtle and vivific effluvia."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. RAY admitted the opinion of Dr. GREW, but, at fir&s;t, with all that caution which becomes a philo&s;opher; as appears in his "<HI>Hi&s;toria Plantarum,</HI>" vol. i. p. 18. <HI>Nos ut veri&s;imilem tantum admittimus.</HI> He a&s;&s;ents to it with le&s;s re&s;erve in his "<HI>Synop&s;is Stir|pium Britannicarum,</HI>" edit. 1. 1690, p. 28; and in the preface to his "<HI>Sylloge Stirpium Europaearum,</HI>" publi&s;hed in 1694, we find him producing his rea&s;ons for the truth of it, and yielding his full approbation to it.</P>
<P>In 1695, <HI>Rudolph Jacob</HI> CAMERARIUS, profe&s;&s;or of botany and phy&s;ic at <HI>Tubingen,</HI> in his "<HI>Epi&s;tola de Sexu Plantarum,</HI>" ap|pears among the early advocates for this analogy; and, being convinced by the argu|ments of GREW and RAY, &s;eems to have been the fir&s;t who gave &s;tability to the whole by experiments. The&s;e he made on <HI>Maize,</HI> the <HI>Mulberry,</HI> the <HI>Ricinus,</HI> and the <HI>Mercurialis;</HI> the three fir&s;t of which he
<PB N="339" REF="358">
deprived of the &s;taminiferous flowers, and the la&s;t he &s;eparated far from the female, and found, in all, that the fruit did not ri|pen. CAMERARIUS, however, very fairly produces al&s;o, &s;ome objections again&s;t the doctrine, founded on experiments, which at this day have little weight, &s;ince they were made on plants of the <HI>Cryptogamous,</HI> or <HI>Di|oecious</HI> cla&s;&s;es; in the la&s;t of which, it is now known, that &s;ometimes a flower or two of a different &s;ex, may be found intermixed with others.</P>
<P>In 1703, Mr. <HI>Samuel</HI> MORLAND, de|&s;irous, as it &s;hould &s;eem, of extending the <HI>Lewenhoekian</HI> &s;y&s;tem of generation into the vegetable kingdom, produced a paper before the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> in which he advances&mdash;that the <HI>farina</HI> is a <HI>congeries</HI> of &s;eminal plants, one of which mu&s;t be conveyed through the &s;tyle into every <HI>ovum,</HI> or &s;eed, before it can become prolific. Mr. MOR|LAND's hypothe&s;is tended to confirm the general doctrine by exciting curio&s;ity on the &s;ubject, at a time when <HI>Lewenhoek</HI>'s theory was popular; but was not admi&s;&s;ible in it&s;elf, &s;ince few &s;tyles are hollow, or, if
<PB N="340" REF="359">
perceptibly tubular, not pervious enough to admit particles of the u&s;ual magnitude of the <HI>farina.</HI></P>
<P>After this time, &s;everal of the learned on the continent entered into re&s;earches on this &s;ubject. <HI>M.</HI> GEOFFROY, in 1711, in a paper read before the <HI>Royal Academy of Sci|ences,</HI> after having formed a theory by con|ciliating GREW's and MORLAND's into one, concludes by a&s;&s;erting&mdash;that the germ is never to be &s;een in the &s;eed, till the <HI>fa|rina</HI> is &s;hed; and that if the plant is de|prived of the <HI>&s;tamina,</HI> before this du&s;t is fallen, the &s;eed will either not ripen, or will not prove fertile.</P>
<P>It is matter of &s;urprize, that the illu&s;|trious TOURNEFORT &s;hould wholly reject the doctrine of the <HI>&s;exes</HI> of plants. So far even from acknowledging this function of the <HI>farina,</HI> that he held it to be excremen|titious. See <HI>I&s;agoge in Rem Herbariam,</HI> p. 70.</P>
<P><HI>Julius</HI> PONTEDERA, a &s;trenuous fol|lower of TOURNEFORT, a noble <HI>Italian</HI> of <HI>Pi&s;a,</HI> illu&s;trious for his knowledge of the an|tient languages, and antiquities of <HI>Italy,</HI> and not le&s;s celebrated for botanical knowledge
<PB N="341" REF="360">
and literature, combats al&s;o the notion of this analogy, and u&s;es of the <HI>&s;tamina,</HI> through the whole &s;econd book of his "<HI>Anthologia.</HI>" In the end he rejects the &s;exual analogy, and con&s;iders it as entirely chimerical. But finding all flowers furni&s;hed with a &s;tyle, or tube, he advances, that it &s;erves to con|vey the air to the fruit, by which, an inte&s;|tine and fertilizing motion is excited in the &s;eed, or ovary.</P>
<P>In 1718, Mon&s;. VAILLANT publi&s;hed "<HI>Sermo de Structura Florum, horum Diffe|rentia, u&s;uque Partium;</HI>" which had been read the year before, at the opening of the Royal Garden. In this di&s;cour&s;e, he de|&s;cribes the bur&s;ting of the <HI>antherae,</HI> in a &s;tyle too florid for philo&s;ophical narration. He relates &s;everal of his own di&s;coveries on the nature of the <HI>farina,</HI> and the exploding power of the <HI>antherae,</HI> and concludes with a&s;&s;enting entirely to Dr. GREW's &s;entiment, (though without naming him), that im|pregnation is performed by means of a &s;ubtle <HI>aura,</HI> and not by the tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of the du&s;t through the &s;tyle, alledging again&s;t it tho&s;e
<PB N="342" REF="361">
rea&s;ons I have mentioned, in &s;peaking of MORLAND's opinion.</P>
<P>In <HI>England,</HI> about the &s;ame time, Dr. <HI>Patrick</HI> BLAIR, by his "Botanick E&s;&s;ays," contributed greatly to extend the know|ledge, and confirm the truth of this &s;ubject. BRADLEY, FAIRCHILD, MILLER, and others, a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the &s;ame de&s;ign; and, &s;ince that period, I believe it has met with few oppo&s;ers. One of the mo&s;t formidable was the late learned Dr. <HI>Al&s;ton,</HI> profe&s;&s;or of botany at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> from who&s;e laboured di&s;qui&s;ition, the adver&s;aries to this opinion of the <HI>&s;ex</HI> of flowers, may furni&s;h them|&s;elves with the mo&s;t cogent arguments, that an intimate knowledge of the &s;ubject hath enabled a very diligent and learned writer to produce.</P>
<P>The more recent experiments made by the Abbe SPALANZANI, with a direct view to impugn this doctrine, do not appear to have been conducted with that degree of &s;kill, and accuracy, which is &s;ufficient to outweigh the numerous train that may be thrown into the oppo&s;ite &s;cale. Even
<PB N="343" REF="362">
&s;ome of the Abbe's own experiments &s;eem rather to &s;trengthen the opinion he means to overthrow.</P>
<P>Having traced the hi&s;tory of this impor|tant proce&s;s in the economy of vegetables, to the time of LINNAEUS, I judge it will be unnece&s;&s;ary, to accompany the reader through a particular detail of authors below this period. In 1732, LINNAEUS founded his &s;y&s;tem on this doctrine; and the addi|tional arguments, and experiments, produced by him&s;elf, his pupils, and followers, have e&s;tabli&s;hed the truth of it, to the compleat &s;atisfaction of impartial enquirers. Tho&s;e, however, who wi&s;h to peru&s;e the mo&s;t per|fect &s;ummary of all the arguments, and ex|periments, in favour of this analogy, are referred to the "<HI>Spon&s;alia Plantarum,</HI>" writ|ten in the year 1746, and printed in the fir&s;t volume of the "<HI>Amoenitates Academi|cae,</HI>" and to the "Di&s;&s;ertation on the Sexes of Plants," written by LINNAEUS in 1760, which obtained the premium of the Academy of <HI>Peter&s;burgh,</HI> and has lately been tran&s;lated into <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> by the ingenious and learned po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the <HI>Linnaean</HI> collec|tion.
<PB N="344" REF="363">
To which may be added, the wri|tings of KOELRUTER, in the &s;ucceeding year, which have not a little tended to confirm the &s;ubject in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>It would be unju&s;t to the memory of Dr. GREW, to conclude this hi&s;tory, without remarking, that the re&s;ult of the late&s;t, and be&s;t experiments, have confirmed his idea, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the <HI>farina</HI> it&s;elf is not carried to the <HI>rudiment</HI> of the &s;eed,"</Q> but, that foecun|dation is effected by the effluvia. This will appear, by citing the &s;ummary view of the doctrine, as exhibited by LINNAEUS him&s;elf, in the Di&s;&s;ertation above men|tioned.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"While plants are in flower, the <HI>pollen</HI> falls from the <HI>antherae,</HI> and is di&s;per&s;ed abroad. At the &s;ame time that the <HI>pollen</HI> is &s;cattered, the <HI>&s;tigma</HI> is then in its highe&s;t vigour, and for a portion of the day at lea&s;t is moi&s;tened with a fine dew. The <HI>pollen</HI> ea&s;ily finds acce&s;s to the <HI>&s;tig|ma,</HI> where it not only adheres by means of the dew of the part, but the moi&s;ture occa&s;ions its bur&s;ting, by which means its contents are di&s;charged. What i&s;&s;ued

from it being mixed with the <HI>fluid</HI> of the <HI>&s;tigma,</HI> is conveyed to the <HI>rudiments</HI> of the <HI>&s;eed.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>I remark before I conclude, that, how ju&s;t &s;oever it may have been in a philo&s;o|phical view, to con&s;ider the <HI>&s;tamina</HI> and <HI>pi&s;tils,</HI> as an&s;wering to the re&s;pective func|tions of <HI>&s;ex</HI> in the animal kingdom, it &s;hould not have been forgotten, that in ani|mals, this proce&s;s is voluntary; but that in vegetables, notwith&s;tanding all that the ingenuity of the antients and moderns have urged in defence of the &s;entient principle, we are not <HI>yet</HI> ju&s;tified in referring this pro|ce&s;s to any other than what we are accu&s;|tomed to call a mechanical cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The principle of this it will not be ex|pected that I &s;hould explain. It may be conjectured, that after a perfect elaboration of the juices in the <HI>antherae</HI> and <HI>&s;tigmata,</HI> &s;ome &s;pecies of attraction takes place be|tween them, perhaps of the electrical kind, &s;omewhat like this having been manife&s;ted in the fla&s;hings ob&s;ervable in &s;ome flowers in the evenings. The reader will ea&s;ily perceive, that I refer to the appearance fir&s;t

<HEAD>WILLISEL.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not to the &s;ons of erudition alone, that botany is indebted for all its di&s;co|veries, and improvements. The love of plants has, not unfrequently, &s;eized, with uncommon ardour, the minds of many, on whom the light of learning had not &s;hed its influence; and &s;purred them on, in the pur&s;uit of this knowledge, to attainments that have been highly beneficial to the &s;ci|ence.
<PB N="348" REF="367">
From &s;uch, let not the pride of learning withhold that prai&s;e which is &s;o ju&s;tly due. One of the mo&s;t remarkable in&s;tances of this kind, is well known to tho&s;e who are conver&s;ant with the writings of MERRET, RAY, and MORISON; and I feel regret at not being able to commemo|rate the name of <HI>Thomas</HI> WILLISEL, with &s;ome of the circum&s;tances of his life; &s;ince I am uninformed of the time, and place, both of his birth, and of his death. This indu&s;trious man &s;eems to have devoted much of his life to the inve&s;tigation of <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> plants; and, as he lived at a time when <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> botany was yet imperfect, he added largely to the &s;tock of new di&s;coveries. He was employed by Dr. MORISON, &s;oon after his e&s;tabli&s;hment at <HI>Oxford,</HI> to collect rare <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> plants; and Dr. MERRET informs us, as hath been noticed, that he travelled five &s;ummers at his expence, into the dif|ferent parts of <HI>England,</HI> to make collections for his "<HI>Pinax;</HI>" which appears to have been greatly enriched with many of the mo&s;t rare &s;pecies, by the labours of WILLISEL.
<PB N="349" REF="368">
I believe he was once &s;ent into <HI>Ireland</HI> by Dr. SHERARD. Mr. RAY was benefited by his re&s;earches; and, if I do not mi&s;take, he accompanied that celebrated naturali&s;t in one of his tours. The emolument ari&s;ing from the&s;e employments was probably a|mong the principal means of his &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence.</P>
<P>His knowledge was not confined to the vegetable kingdom; &s;ince Mr. RAY in|forms us, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he was employed by the <HI>Royal Society</HI> in the &s;earch of natural ra|rities, both animals, plants, and mine|rals; for which purpo&s;es he was the fit|te&s;t man in <HI>England,</HI> both for his &s;kill and indu&s;try."</Q></P>

<P>Dr. <HI>Robert</HI> PLOTT, eminent for being the fir&s;t who &s;ketched out a plan for a na|tural hi&s;tory of <HI>England,</HI> by exemplifying it in that of <HI>Oxford&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Stafford&s;hire,</HI> although not profe&s;&s;edly a writer in the botanic line, cannot be omitted in a work of this kind.</P>
<P>He was born at <HI>Borden,</HI> near <HI>Sitting|borne,</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> and educated at <HI>Wye,</HI> in the &s;ame county; entered a &s;tudent in <HI>Magda|len Hall,</HI> in 1657; and, in 1671, took the degree of doctor of laws. He became fel|low of the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> and was made one of the &s;ecretaries in 1682. In the &s;ame year he was con&s;tituted the fir&s;t keeper of the <HI>A&s;hmolean</HI> Mu&s;eum, and profe&s;&s;or of chymi&s;|try: all which places he kept till 1690; having al&s;o, in 1687, been appointed <HI>Mow|bray</HI> herald extraordinary, and regi&s;ter to the earl mar&s;hal, or court of honour, then newly revived, after having lain dormant from the year 1641. He died April 30, 1696. There is a whole length portrait of

<P>Dr. PLOTT was a man of various erudi|tion, but is at this time be&s;t known for his natural hi&s;tories of <HI>Oxford&s;hire,</HI> and of <HI>Staf|ford&s;hire.</HI> The fir&s;t of the&s;e was publi&s;hed in 1677, in folio; and again in 1705, with the author's corrections and additions, by his &s;on-in-law, Mr. <HI>Burman,</HI> vicar of <HI>New|ington,</HI> in <HI>Kent.</HI> The natural hi&s;tory of <HI>Stafford&s;hire,</HI> in 1679, in folio, and re|printed in 1686.

<HEAD>NATURAL HISTORY OF COUNTIES.</HEAD>
<P>I have before ob&s;erved, that Dr. PLOTT was the fir&s;t author of a &s;eparate volume on Provincial Natural Hi&s;tory; in which, it is but ju&s;tice to add, that, with due allowance for the time when he wrote, he has not
<PB N="353" REF="372">
been excelled by any &s;ub&s;equent writer. It were to be wi&s;hed, that more examples of the like kind might be adduced; but there are few exactly of the &s;ame &s;cope. After Bi&s;hop GIBSON, in his edition of CAM|DEN, printed in 1695, had in&s;erted the provincial li&s;ts of plants drawn up by Mr. RAY, &s;everal writers of county hi&s;tories have, either from their own knowledge of the &s;ubject, or by the aid of friends, in&s;erted catalogues of the <HI>more rare</HI> plants in their re&s;pective works. As the&s;e form, in an e&s;pecial manner, a part of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> botany, it is incumbent upon me to enumerate them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t after CAMDEN, is "The Na|tural Hi&s;tory of <HI>Lanca&s;hire, Che&s;hire,</HI> and the Peak in <HI>Derby&s;hire.</HI>" Oxford, 1700. fol. By <HI>Charles</HI> LEIGH, M.D. The au|thor takes into his catalogue the maritime plants, with the others, and briefly recites the virtues, and the medicinal cla&s;&s;es, to which the &s;ubjects belong. He &s;ubjoins his conjectures on the food of vegetables, and conte&s;ts the opinion of Dr. WOOD|WARD,
<PB N="354" REF="373">
that plants are nouri&s;hed by the earthy principle alone.</P>
<P>"An E&s;&s;ay towards a Natural Hi&s;tory of <HI>We&s;tmorland</HI> and <HI>Cumberland,</HI> wherein an account is given of their &s;everal mi|neral and &s;urface productions."

The author has been mentioned before, as a corre&s;pondent of Mr. RAY. He here enumerates profe&s;|&s;edly the plants not mentioned in the <HI>Sy|nop&s;is</HI> of that author, amounting to about twenty; of which, however, &s;ome were only varieties.</P>
<P>"The Natural Hi&s;tory of <HI>Northampton|&s;hire,</HI> with &s;ome account of the Antiqui|ties." By <HI>John</HI> MORETON, A.M. F.R.S. rector of <HI>Oxendon,</HI> in the &s;ame county. Lond. 1712. fol. This is a work of me|rit. In the li&s;t of plants, &s;everal occur ad|ditional to tho&s;e noticed by RAY; even &s;ome of the mo&s;&s;es are not forgotten.

<P>In the "Natural Hi&s;tory of <HI>Cornwall,</HI>" by <HI>William</HI> BORLACE, A.M. F.R.S. Ox|ford, 1758, we meet with a very brief li&s;t, containing about thirty-eight land plants, and twenty <HI>fuci,</HI> with &s;ome &s;cattered remarks on the qualities and u&s;es. Among the rare plants are the Verticillate Knotgra&s;s, the Roman Nettle, the Gunhilly Heath, and the Corni&s;h Pennywort; of which la&s;t there is a very indifferent figure in tab. 29. f. 6. Under the article Sun-dew, <HI>(Dro&s;era)</HI> there is a curious and intere&s;ting ob&s;ervation made by Dr. BORLACE, in which he a&s;&s;erts, that the well-known pernicious quality of that vegetable, in producing the rot among &s;heep, where it abounds, does not ari&s;e from any cau&s;tic power in the vegetable, but from an in&s;ect, which lays its eggs, and feeds on the
<PB N="356" REF="375">
plant. From his account, this in&s;ect ap|pears to be the <HI>Drop&s;y Worm</HI> of Dr. TY|SON, or the <HI>Hydra Hydatula</HI> of LIN|NAEUS.</P>

<P>From CAMDEN, from the&s;e hi&s;tories, and other re&s;ources, Profe&s;&s;or MARTYN has compiled an abridged li&s;t of all the rare plants, dige&s;ted in the order of the coun|ties, which is intended for the u&s;e of the

<HEAD>WHELER.</HEAD>
<P>As I do not &s;trictly confine my&s;elf to &s;uch writers, as have di&s;tingui&s;hed them|&s;elves by their di&s;coveries in the indigenous botany of <HI>Britain,</HI> alone, I cannot therefore omit to mention &s;o eminent a man as Sir <HI>George</HI> WHELER. He was the &s;on of Col. WHELER, of <HI>Charing,</HI> in <HI>Kent;</HI> and was born in 1650, at <HI>Breda,</HI> his parents being there in exile with the royal family. At the age of &s;eventeen, he became a com|moner of <HI>Lincoln College, Oxford;</HI> and, be|fore he took any degree, went on his tra|vels. He &s;pent near two years in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy;</HI> and, in 1675, travelled into <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia Minor;</HI> from whence he returned in <HI>November</HI> 1676. He was knighted before he took his ma&s;ter of arts degree, which was conferred upon him in 1683, in con&s;ideration of his learning, and in return for a pre&s;ent of antiquities col|lected in his travels. He afterwards took
<PB N="358" REF="377">
&s;ome valuable preferments in the church; was created doctor of divinity in 1702; and died Feb. 18, 1724.</P>
<P>In 1682, was publi&s;hed, "A Journey into <HI>Greece,</HI> by <HI>George</HI> WHELER, E&s;q. in company of Dr. SPON, of <HI>Lyons;</HI> in &s;ix books; with four tables of coins, and many other &s;culptures." Fol. pp. 483.</P>
<P>The&s;e gentlemen travelled with PAUSA|NIAS in their hands, by who&s;e means they corrected, and explained, &s;everal of the an|tiquities and traditions of <HI>Greece.</HI> The pri|mary objects of the&s;e learned travellers were, to copy the in&s;criptions, and de&s;cribe the antiquities and coins of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia Mi|nor,</HI> and particularly of <HI>Athens,</HI> where they &s;ojourned a month. The&s;e travels are highly valued for their authenticity, and are replete with &s;ound and in&s;tructive erudition to the medalli&s;t and antiquary.</P>
<P>Mr. WHELER appears, on all occa&s;ions, to have been attentive to the natural hi&s;tory of <HI>Greece,</HI> and particularly to the plants, of which he enumerates &s;everal hundreds in this volume, and giv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> the engravings of &s;ome. The&s;e catalogues &s;ufficiently evince
<PB N="359" REF="378">
his knowledge of the botany of his time. He brought from the Ea&s;t &s;everal which had not been cultivated in <HI>Britain</HI> before. Among the&s;e, the <HI>Hypericum olympicum</HI> (St. John's Wort of Olympus) is a well-known plant, introduced by this learned traveller. RAY, MORISON, and PLUKENET, all ac|knowledge their obligations for curious plants received from him.</P>
<P>After Sir <HI>George</HI> WHELER entered into the church, he publi&s;hed "An Account of the Churches and Places of A&s;&s;embly of the Primitive Chri&s;tians; from the Churches of <HI>Tyre, Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> de&s;cribed by <HI>Eu&s;ebius,</HI> and ocular Ob&s;ervations of &s;everal very an|tient Edifices yet extant in tho&s;e Parts: with a &s;ea&s;onable Application." Lond. 1689.</P>
<P>The Rev. <HI>Granville</HI> WHELER, of <HI>Otter|den Place, Kent,</HI> and rector of <HI>Leak,</HI> in <HI>Not|tingham&s;hire,</HI> who died in 1770, was the third &s;on of Sir <HI>George</HI> WHELER, and be|came his heir. He di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf as a gentleman of &s;cience, and a polite &s;cholar. He was the friend and patron of Mr. <HI>Stephen</HI>
<PB N="360" REF="379">
GRAY; who, jointly with him, contributed to revive the &s;tudy of electricity in <HI>England.</HI> Let me be allowed to add, that I wi&s;h to mention the name of this gentleman with gratitude, from the recollection of that en|couragement which I per&s;onally received from him in my pur&s;uits of natural hi&s;tory, at a very early period of life; and which was of &s;uch a nature, as &s;eldom fails to ani|mate the minds of the young, to exertion and improvement.</P>
