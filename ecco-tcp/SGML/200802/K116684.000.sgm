<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>WE are not to do evil that good may come of it, el&s;e I might plead in favour of the following little poem, that, whatever its faults may be, it was under|taken and pur&s;ued with a laudable de&s;ign. The ridiculou&s;ne&s;s, not to &s;ay barbarity, of turning SHAKESPEAR's plays into operas, and larding them with &s;ongs from quite different authors, as hath been lately prac|ti&s;ed upon our mo&s;t ju&s;tly approved the|atre, is, I apprehend, of &s;o glaring a nature, that every one, who is endued with the &s;malle&s;t &s;park of ta&s;te, mu&s;t immedi|ately be &s;truck with it. It is indeed the &s;ame thing, as if any per&s;on &s;hould take it into
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
his head to reduce one of our antient Goth|ick cathedrals to a modern &s;ummer-hou&s;e, and ornament it with de&s;igns from Half|penny's Chine&s;e architecture. Such is the deva&s;tation and overturning! &s;uch are the breaks and patches!</P>
<P>There is no man in England, I believe, who has greater re&s;pect for a piece of beef<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A thing to which Shake&s;pear has been more than once compared.</NOTE> than I have; but &s;hould I therefore like it cut into mince meat, and mixed with my cu&s;tard and apple-pie? Certainly, no: the impropriety of the olio would then di&s;|gu&s;t me. So do the vigorous lines of SHAKESPEAR, when I meet them ha&s;hed up, with Waller and Cowley, in the lu&s;ci|ous compo&s;itions of a mu&s;ical entertain|ment.</P>
<P>If we mu&s;t have Engli&s;h operas, &s;ome|what of le&s;s value, and at the &s;ame time better calculated for the end propo&s;ed, might, I thought, be made u&s;e of. But
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
many people will a&s;k, what occa&s;ion is there that we &s;hould have Engli&s;h operas at all? Let any common lover of mu&s;ick go but once to the King's theatre in the Hay-market, and he will ea&s;ily perceive, that the Italian compo&s;ition does, and mu&s;t, with all its incon&s;i&s;tencies, for ever excel any thing we can produce of the like nature; and this, not for want of abilities in our compo&s;ers, but thro' the in&s;uperable di&s;advantages of our language. Had I &s;een any of their mu&s;ical dramas be|fore I undertook this, LEUCOTH&Ouml;E &s;hould never have been written: but &s;ince it is done, and cannot be recalled, I hope I &s;hall be pardoned, if I am willing to try, whether it may not be borne as a juvenile attempt at poetry; tho' I have not been &s;ollicitous to have it accompanied with the graces of that harmony for which it was originally intended.</P>
<P>A French poeta&s;ter would have &s;ent &s;uch a <HI>petit piece</HI> into the world with the
<PB N="viii" REF="6">
title of <HI>Tragedie</HI>; but the Author of this hath not been long enough of the trade to acquire &s;o much confidence. Opera he mu&s;t not call it, becau&s;e it &s;hould then end happily, which the di&s;po&s;ition of his fable would not admit of: he therefore lets it go under the denomina|tion of a DRAMATIC POEM. But becau&s;e it is, &s;ave in that one in&s;tance of its ca|ta&s;trophe, an opera, he begs leave to &s;ub|join what one of the fir&s;t Engli&s;h poets hath written of that &s;pecies of the drama; which will be &s;ufficient to &s;hew, that, if he has failed in it, it is what a greater genius might have done; and, if he has &s;ucceeded, it is what the greate&s;t genius has not been a&s;hamed to think worthy of his accompli&s;hing.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"An opera, [&s;ays Mr. DRYDEN, in his preface to ALBION and ALBANUS] is a poetical tale or fiction, repre&s;ented by vocal and in&s;trumental mu&s;ick, adorn|ed with &s;cenes, machines, and dancing.
<PB N="ix" REF="7">
The &s;uppo&s;ed per&s;ons of this mu&s;ical drama are generally &s;upernatural, as gods and godde&s;&s;es, and heroes, which at lea&s;t are de&s;cended from them, and are in due time to be adopted of their number. The &s;ubject, therefore, being extended beyond the limits of human nature, admits of that &s;ort of marvel|lous which is rejected in other plays. Human impo&s;&s;ibilities are to be received as they are in faith, becau&s;e, where the Gods are introduced, a Supreme Power is under&s;tood, and &s;econd cau&s;es are out of doors.&mdash;If the per&s;ons repre|&s;ented were to &s;peak upon the &s;tage, it would follow of nece&s;&s;ity, that the expre&s;&s;ions &s;hould be lofty, figurative, and maje&s;tical. But the nature of an opera denies the frequent u&s;e of tho&s;e poetical ornaments; for vocal mu&s;ick, tho' it often admits a loftine&s;s of &s;ound, yet always exacts an harmonious &s;weet|ne&s;s, or, to di&s;tingui&s;h yet more ju&s;tly,
<PB N="x" REF="8">
the recitative part of the opera requires a more ma&s;culine beauty of expre&s;|&s;ion and &s;ound: the other, which, for want of a properer word, I mu&s;t call the &s;ongi&s;h part, mu&s;t abound in &s;oft|ne&s;s, and variety of numbers; its prin|cipal intention being to plea&s;e the hear|ing, rather than gratify the under&s;tand|ing."</Q>
He ends all, after having given the preference to the Italian opera, thus:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If I thought it convenient, I could here di&s;cover &s;ome rules which I have given to my&s;elf in writing an opera in general, and in this opera in particular: but I con|&s;ider, that the effect would only be, to have my own performance mea&s;ured by the laws I gave, and con&s;equently &s;et up little judges, who, not under&s;tanding thoroughly, would be &s;ure to fall upon the faults, and not to acknowledge any of the beauties. Here, therefore, if they will critici&s;e, they &s;hall do it out of their own fund; but let them be a&s;&s;ured,
<PB N="xi" REF="9">
that their ears are nice, for there is nei|ther writing nor judging on this &s;ubject without that good quality. It is no ea&s;y matter, in our language, to make words &s;o &s;mooth, and numbers &s;o harmonious, that they &s;hall almo&s;t &s;et them&s;elves; and yet there are rules for this in nature, and as great a certainty and quantity in our &s;yllables, as either in the Greek or Latin. But let poets and judges under|&s;tand this fir&s;t, and then let them begin to &s;tudy Engli&s;h. When they have chewed a while upon the&s;e preliminaries, it may be they will &s;carce adventure to tax me with want of thought and elevation of fancy in this work; for they will &s;oon be &s;atisfied that tho&s;e are not the nature of this &s;ort of writing. The nece&s;&s;ity of double rhimes, and ordering of the words and numbers for the &s;weetne&s;s of the voice, are the main hinges on which an opera mu&s;t move; and both of the&s;e are without the compa&s;s of any art to
<PB N="xii" REF="10">
teach another to perform, unle&s;s Na|ture in the fir&s;t place has done her part, by enduing the poet with nicety of hearing, that the di&s;cord of &s;ounds in words &s;hall as much offend him as a &s;eventh in mu&s;ic would a good com|po&s;er. I have therefore no need to make excu&s;es for meanne&s;s of thought in many places. The Italians, with all the advantages of their language, are continually forced on it, or rather they affect it. The chief &s;ecret is in the choice of words; and by this choice I do not mean elegancy of expre&s;&s;ion, but propriety of &s;ound, to be varied according to the nature of the &s;ubject.&mdash;The &s;ame rea&s;ons which depre&s;s thought in an opera, have a &s;tronger effect upon the words, e&s;pecially in our language; for there is no maintaining the purity of Engli&s;h in &s;hort mea&s;ures, where the rhime returns &s;o quick, and is &s;o often female or double rhime;
<PB N="xiii" REF="11">
which is not natural to our tongue, be|cau&s;e it con&s;i&s;ts too much of mono&s;yl|lables, and tho&s;e too mo&s;t commonly clogged with con&s;onants; for which rea&s;on I am often forced to coin new words, revive &s;ome that are antiquated, and botch others.</Q></P>

<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>LEUCOTH&Ouml;E, daughter of ORCHAMUS King of Per&s;ia, is beloved, and &s;ecretly enjoyed by the SUN; when CLYTIE, a former mi&s;tre&s;s of his, becomes acquainted with their amour, and, in the rage of jealou&s;y, makes a full di&s;|covery of it to the Lady's father. ORCHAMUS, as a puni&s;hment for his daughter's crime, orders her to be buried alive; which is accordingly executed in her lover's ab&s;ence; who, coming too late to give her any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, fir&s;t changes her body into a tree of frankincen&s;e, and then CLYTIE, the cau&s;e of her misfortune, into a &s;tatue.</P>
<P>This is the chief &s;ubject-matter of the fol|lowing rhimes. In OVID we are told that CLYTIE was metamorpho&s;ed into a &s;un-flower: but the Author hopes he need not make any apology for deviating from his original in that particular, any more than for &s;ome other trifling circum&s;tances which he has taken the liberty to vary, and others which he has entirely omitted as foreign to his purpo&s;e.</P>
