<P>_A Prince&s;s of the &s;ame Royal Blood to which you are &s;o clo&s;ely and &s;o happily ally'd, pre&s;umes to throw her &s;elf at the Feet of YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS for Protection. The Character of that Excellent Lady, as it is deliver'd down to us in Hi&s;tory,
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
is very near the &s;ame with the Picture I have endeavour'd to draw of her: And if, in the Poetical Colouring, I have aim'd at heightning and improving &s;ome of the Features, it was only to make her more worthy of tho&s;e Illu&s;trious Hands to which I always intended to pre&s;ent her.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation, in general, is in|finitely indebted to YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS, &s;o every particular Per&s;on among&s;t us ought to contribute, according to their &s;everal Capacitys and Abilitys, towards the di&s;charging that Publick Ob|ligation.</P>
<P>We are your Debtors, MADAM, for the Preference You gave us, in chu&s;ing to wear the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> rather than the <HI>Imperial</HI> Crown; for giving the Be&s;t Daughter to our KING, and the Be&s;t Wife to our PRINCE. It is to YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS we owe the Security that

<P>This is what we may certainly reckon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">mong&s;t the Benefits YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS has confer'd upon us.

All things that are Great have been offer'd to You, and all things that are Good and Happy, as well in this World as a Better, &s;hall become the Reward of &s;uch Exalted Virtue and Piety.

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THO I have very little Inclination to writ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Preface before Works of this nature, yet, upon this parti|cular Occa&s;ion, I cannot but think my &s;elf oblig'd to give &s;ome &s;hort Account of this Play, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> ju&s;tice to my &s;elf, as to a very Learned and Ingenious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> man, my Friend, who is dead. The Per&s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t-Church, Oxon:</HI> one who&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> I could with great plea&s;ure enter into, if it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> very well known to the World. As I had the Happine&s;s to be intimately acquainted with him, he often told me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ign'd writing a Tragedy upon the Story of the Lady <HI>Jane Gray;</HI> and if he had liv'd, I &s;hould never have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> meddling with it my &s;elf. But as he dy'd without doing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> in the beginning of the la&s;t Summer I re&s;olv'd to undertake <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> And indeed the hopes I had of receiving &s;ome con&s;iderable A&s;+&s;i&s;tances from the Papers he left behind him, were one of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> principal Motives that induc'd me to go about it. The&s;e Pa+pers were in the hands of Mr. <HI>Ducket,</HI> to whom my Fri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters"> Mr. <HI>Tho. Burnett</HI> was &s;o kind to write and procure 'em for me. The lea&s;t Return I can make to tho&s;e Gentlemen is this publick Acknowledgment of their great Civility on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">

occa&s;ion. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, before tho&s;e Papers came to my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">and; I had intirely form'd the De&s;ign or Fable of my own Play: And when I came to look 'em over, I found it was very different from that which Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> intended; the Plan of his being drawn after that, which is in Print, of Mr. <HI>Banks:</HI> at lea&s;t I thought &s;o, by what I could pick out of his Papers, To &s;ay the truth, I was a good deal &s;ur|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">iz'd and di&s;appointed at the &s;ight of 'em. I hop'd to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">et with great part of the Play written to my hand, or at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">a&s;t the whole De&s;ign regularly drawn out. In&s;tead of that, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> found the quantity of about two Quires of Paper written over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> odd pieces, blotted, interlin'd and confus'd. What was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ntain'd in 'em in general, was loo&s;e Hints of Sentiments, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hort ob&s;cure Sketches of Scenes. But how they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> be apply'd, or in what order they were to be rang'd, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">uld not by any Diligence of mine (and I look'd 'em very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">refully over more than once) come to under&s;tand. One <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">cene there was, and one only, that &s;eem'd pretty near per|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ct; in which Lord <HI>Guilford</HI> &s;ingly per&s;uades the Lady <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ne to take the Crown. From that I borrow'd all that I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">uld, and in&s;erted it in my own third Act. But indeed the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters">er and Turn of his Fable was &s;o different from mine, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> I could not take above five and twenty or thirty Lines at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> mo&s;t; and even in tho&s;e I was oblig'd to make &s;ome Al|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ration.
