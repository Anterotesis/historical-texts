<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALBINA had the honour of being known to your Lord&s;hip, almo&s;t from her infancy. Her faults, and her graces, You are already acquainted with, as &s;he grew up in &s;ome mea&s;ure beneath your Lord&s;hip's eye. She is now arrived at maturity; and if in her pre&s;ent &s;tate, my Lord, you &s;hould find her more poli&s;hed, than when &s;he had la&s;t the honour of your attention, it is chiefly owing to the hints with which you then favoured me.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE very favourable reception with which the Pieces I have pre&s;ented to the Stage, have been honoured by the Public, has given them the appearance of great &s;ucce&s;s; and it is pro|bable that tho&s;e who were witne&s;&s;es of their reception, will be &s;urpri&s;ed to find this Tragedy prefaced by complaints of hard|&s;hip and injury, and to know that it has been productive of a train of mortifications and di&s;appointments to its Author.</P>
<P>It is with the utmo&s;t reluctance that I feel my&s;elf compelled to enter into the di&s;agreeable circum&s;tances which preceded the re|pre&s;entation. This is however nece&s;&s;ary, as I now pre&s;ent a Tra|gedy, which I pre&s;ume to call <HI>original,</HI> to the cooler in&s;pec|tion of the Reader, though I know that the principal circum|&s;tances of the plot, and the leading traits of character, have appeared in other Plays, previous to the repre&s;entation of this.</P>
<P>The idea of writing for the Stage &s;truck me by mere accident, and the <HI>Runaway</HI> was my fir&s;t literary attempt of any kind. I am as ready, as the &s;evere&s;t Critic can wi&s;h, to admit that it has all the crudene&s;s of a fir&s;t attempt. It &s;ucceeded however, on the Stage, far beyond my mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations; and during its run, which was &s;topped by the Benefits, was one of the mo&s;t profitable Plays, both to the Author and Manager, that appears on the records of the <HI>Trea&s;ury-books</HI> at either Hou&s;e.&mdash;A &s;ucce&s;s &s;o encouraging opened a new pro&s;pect of advantage to my Family, which I have &s;ince pur&s;ued with alacrity; but this &s;ucce&s;s clo&s;ed with the unfortunate period in which Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> re&s;igned the management of Drury-Lane.</P>
<P>When Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI> obtained a &s;hare of the Patent, I flattered my&s;elf that I had &s;ome right to his attention, as Author of the la&s;t piece which was produced by his able Predece&s;&s;or; but the fir&s;t Winter in which he commenced the management, my Comedy, to u&s;e the technical term, was <HI>&s;helf'd.</HI> The vanity of a young Author was piqued; and I wrote to Mr. <HI>Sheridan,</HI> in the civile&s;t terms I could, to remon&s;trate on the occa&s;ion; but of my letter not the lea&s;t notice was taken. As I was not then informed of Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI>'s general neglect of letters, I con&s;idered this &s;light as a particular in&s;ult to me, e&s;pecially as the Comedy was not played again that year, but by command of their Maje&s;ties, and for the benefit of Performers. I therefore &s;elt my&s;elf under a
<PB REF="4">
nece&s;&s;ity of pre&s;enting my Tragedy at Covent-Garden; but, as I had &s;ome rea&s;on to dread Mr. <HI>Harris</HI>'s opinions, it was pre&s;ented to him, in the Summer of 1777, by a Lady of Rank, with the name and &s;ex of the Author concealed. After &s;everal weeks of anxious expectation, it was returned, peremptorily rejected. I then waited on him, and avowed the unfortunate Piece, but had little rea&s;on to flatter my&s;elf with the circum&s;tances of my re|ception: Mr. <HI>Harris</HI> to d me, that there was no hope from alte|ration; that the Play was unfit for the Stage, and that he was convinced it never could be made fit: he di&s;liked the whole idea of <HI>Gondibert</HI>'s &s;ituation; and thought every incident of the Fifth Act inadmi&s;&s;ible, as he believed no audience would hear it. The la&s;t part of this opinion &s;urpri&s;ed me, as I had conceived the Fifth Act was the principal &s;trength of the Piece; but I was compelled to &s;ubmit: Nor is its <HI>rejection</HI> the injury of which I complain; had the a&s;hes of my Tragedy re&s;ted undi&s;turbed, I might have mourned over them; but I would have mourned in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>The Tragedy of <HI>Percy</HI> was &s;oon after announced. I attended its repre&s;entation with anxious curio&s;ity, at this Play had been approved by that judgement which had decided &s;o &s;everely on mine. At the opening of the Piece, I was much concerned to &s;ee an old Engli&s;h &s;tory attempted, though it bore little re&s;em|blance to the legendary tales of <HI>Percy</HI> and <HI>Douglas;</HI> and that &s;o much was &s;aid of Chivalry, and of expeditions to the Holy Land&mdash;circum&s;tances which, though finely calculated for the Stage, had been much neglected by our Poets, in favour of the tales of Greek and Roman antiquity. Yet, as the Cru&s;ades are common hi&s;to|rical facts, I could only con&s;ider my being in &s;ome mea&s;ure anticipated, as unfortunate. But I can hardly de&s;cribe my a&s;toni&s;hment, or di&s;tre&s;s, when I &s;aw <HI>Raby,</HI> the Father of the Heroine, appear in almo&s;t the &s;ame &s;ituation with <HI>We&s;tmoreland;</HI> and re&s;ent his Son-in-law's imputation on the honour of his Daughter, in a train of ideas exactly &s;imilar to tho&s;e which I had given to the Father of <HI>Adina;</HI> and that he even &s;poke &s;e|veral lines nearly verbatim; which will be found on comparing the two Tragedies.</P>
<P>I learnt from the Papers of next day, that <HI>Percy</HI> was a Tran&s;la|tion from a Tragedy called <HI>Gabrielle de Vergy,</HI> written by M. <HI>Belloy.</HI> I was &s;oon after informed, by per&s;ons who had read the original, (for I am unacquainted with the language) that in M. <HI>Belley</HI>'s Tragedy there is <HI>no Father.</HI> I had remarked, indeed, during the repre&s;entation, that <HI>Raby</HI> &s;eemed to have no connection with the plot; he was out of the way during all the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Play, and returned ju&s;t time enough to challenge the defamer of his Daughter, and to call him&s;elf her Champion; which however neither introduces, nor retards a &s;ingle event,</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="5">
Various were my conjectures on this occa&s;ion; but prudence &s;ugge&s;ted a cautious &s;ilence, as I had &s;till hopes at Drury-Lane. Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI> received me infi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">itely better than I expected, and regretted that I had not brought my Piece before, as Mr. <HI>Jeph&s;on</HI> and Mr. <HI>Craddock</HI> had each a Tragedy promi&s;ed for the next Win|ter, (1778-9) which mu&s;t put it off another Sea&s;on; but a&s;&s;ured me, in the mo&s;t explicit terms, that no other Tragedy &s;hould come be|fore it, provided it was proper for the Stage; which, he added in a very polite manner, he had no doubt of. He &s;oon after received my Farce of <HI>Who's the Dupe?</HI> with equal frankne&s;s, and promi&s;ed that it &s;hould be brought out in the be&s;t part of the Sea&s;on, as &s;ome recompence for the delay of my Tragedy. More than &s;atisfied, happy with my pro&s;pects, I had only to re|gret that I had mi&s;apprehended his neglect of my letter, and cau&s;ed my&s;elf &s;o many unea&s;y hours.</P>
<P>The <HI>Law of Lombardy</HI> was &s;oon after put into Rehear&s;al, and I learnt, with great &s;urpri&s;e, that it bore a re&s;emblance to <HI>Albina</HI> in the conduct of the Piece, though not in the Story or Cha|racters. I was greatly alarmed at the idea of more anticipation; which, whether accidental or otherwi&s;e, was de&s;tructive of every pro&s;pect of reputation or advantage to me. This re&s;emblance was mentioned to Mr. <HI>Sheridan;</HI> and I thought my&s;elf happy when, by his interpo&s;ition, Mr. <HI>Harris</HI> was prevailed on to read the Tragedy, on the &s;ugge&s;tion that &s;ome alteration had been made; and they acknowledged that, if both Pieces were entitled to the Stage, the only means of doing ju&s;tice to both, was to bring them out, at the &s;ame time, at different Hou&s;es; otherwi&s;e the novelty of one of them mu&s;t be de&s;troyed&mdash;and the idea of Rival Tragedies might be as advantageous as that of Rival Actors had been on &s;ome particular occa&s;ions. This matter, of very anxious expectation, was &s;u&s;pended near a month, as Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI> met with great difficulty in finding the Copy of the Tragedy. In the mean-time, the &s;peaking Pantomime of the <HI>Touch&s;tone</HI> was brought out; and, as I was then in great good-humour with Mr. <HI>Harris,</HI> I had a plea&s;ure in endeavouring to &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome u&s;eful alterations, and was happy when he accepted the new &s;cene of <HI>Lady Fa&s;hion's Rout,</HI> which I con&s;idered as an earne&s;t that he intended to accept the Tragedy. Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI> at length found <HI>Albina,</HI> and I at|tended him by appointment. On this occa&s;ion I waited three hours, (which was rather longer than he had ever made me wait before): he came at length with the Tragedy in his hand; and I feel my&s;elf too much flattered by what he then &s;aid, to omit it, whatever length it may add to my tale.</P>
<P>He made a thou&s;and apologies, (and in apologies for negli|gence Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI> is remarkably ea&s;y and &s;ucce&s;sful) but &s;aid he had brought the be&s;t in his hand, which was my Tra|gedy, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have now read every word of it. I was de|termined
<PB N="iv" REF="6">
not to &s;ee you 'till I had; and this it is that has kept me &s;o long. Before I enter into particulars, I will tell you that I think your Tragedy a very good one; it will do you much honour, and be of &s;ervice to the Theatre."</Q>On my acknowledgements, he added,  <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Upon my word, I really think what I &s;ay; and, without a compliment, I am &s;urpri&s;ed that &s;uch a Tragedy could have been refu&s;ed. Mr. <HI>Harris</HI> mu&s;t have &s;een it when his head was full of other bu&s;ine&s;s: if he had read it attentively, he could not have refu&s;ed it. This Tra|gedy has a right to the Stage: it mu&s;t and <HI>&s;hall</HI> be done."</Q></P>
<P>The Tragedy was then opened, and Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI> &s;hewed me &s;everal indentings again&s;t lines which he wi&s;hed me to con&s;ider. He &s;aid the Characters were very &s;trongly drawn, and the Story intere&s;ting; and frequently pointed out pa&s;&s;ages, which, on account of the Poetry, or the Thought, he was plea&s;ed to admire. The only objection of importance was, that he thought <HI>Gondibert</HI> &s;hould not &s;ee, or mention, the Bridal Bed, in the la&s;t Scene: but, on my attempting a timorous defence, he added, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Don't alter this, or any other pa&s;&s;age, unle&s;s it &s;trikes you as it does me; <HI>you</HI> ought to be tenacious: <HI>every original Writer mu&s;t give up pa&s;&s;ages with difficulty: it is only Tran&s;lators, and Borrowers, who are &s;o ready to comply with every hint that is propo&s;ed."</HI></Q></P>
<P>The judgement pronounced by Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI> made me par|ticularly happy, as Mr. <HI>Harris</HI> had promi&s;ed, the &s;ame morning, that he would be guided by Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI>'s opinion, who &s;aid he would give the Tragedy to Mr. <HI>Harris</HI> him&s;elf, and tell him what he thought of it. This was adding favour to favour; and my thanks, I believe, &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ed my &s;entiments.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Harris,</HI> a few days afterwards, took my Tragedy, as he imagined, into the country; but, on opening it, found that Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI> had, by mi&s;take, given him a Comedy. This occa|&s;ioned another week's &s;u&s;pence: it was then however obtained and read; and I had &s;carce a doubt, con&s;idering every circum|&s;tance, that it would be put into immediate Rehear&s;al.</P>
<P>All my hopes were however confounded by Mr. <HI>Harris</HI>'s per|&s;evering with inflexible &s;teadine&s;s in his former opinion. He &s;aid, there had been no material alterations, (which was certainly true;) and that it was &s;till his opinion, that the Tragedy could never be made fit for the Stage. When he was reminded that Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI> entertained a very different opinion of it, he re|plied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I don't believe he has read it: he may have dipped into it; but I am convinced he has not read it through."</Q> This was afterwards di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the pre&s;ence of both, when Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI> a&s;&s;ured Mr. <HI>Harris</HI> that he had read the whole, and that it was his opinion it ought to be done; but Mr. <HI>Harris</HI> remained inflexible.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="7">
When I next &s;aw Mr. <HI>Sheridan,</HI> it was on the &s;ubject of my Farce. He ob&s;erved me di&s;pirited, and kindly taking my hand, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Never mind 'em; you and I will &s;hew that <HI>we know</HI> a good Tragedy."</Q></P>
<P>This Farce Mr. <HI>Harris</HI> had offered to take, and put into im|mediate Rehear&s;al; but, as I had then no doubt of its being played in an advantageous part of the &s;ea&s;on at Drury-Lane, I had no inducement to change the Hou&s;e for which it was in|tended. <HI>Who's the Dupe,</HI> however, in con&s;equence of repeated breaches of appointments and promi&s;es, was not produced till the middle of the Benefits, when it could not have a regular run; and I was then to pay an Hundred Guineas (Thirty of which had been added by the pre&s;ent Managers) for the chance of a Bene|fit, at a time when the current bu&s;ine&s;s of the Theatre would not produce that Sum.</P>
<P>The pecuniary di&s;appointment I did not con&s;ider as material in this in&s;tance, as I hoped that the applau&s;e with which the Farce was uniformly received, would have put an end to the difficulty of getting my Pieces on the Stage, which was infinitely more harra&s;&s;ing to my mind than the labour of producing them. I was however &s;oon after greatly hurt, to hear that Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI> evaded the &s;ubject when it was accidentally men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ioned, and advi&s;ed me to write a Comedy.&mdash;It was nece&s;&s;ary, for this purpo&s;e, that I &s;hould have &s;ome Comic ideas; and <HI>they</HI> were all completely driven from my mind by the vexations I had undergone. I had indeed made &s;ome progre&s;s in writing a Piece founded on Turki&s;h manners, the Scene of which is laid in A&s;ia, and &s;lattered my&s;elf with &s;ucce&s;s from the novelty of the attempt; but it lies, and mu&s;t lie, in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, till I have rea&s;on to believe it will meet with a fair and candid reception from the Theatres.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Craddock</HI>'s Tragedy was then preparing for rehear&s;al, and the parts given out; but another Play of Mi&s;s <HI>More</HI>'s was di&s;|covered to be nearly fini&s;hed; and Mr. <HI>Harris</HI> was &s;o eager to bring it out, though it was then near the conclu&s;ion of the &s;ea&s;on, that &s;he has &s;aid he would hardly give her time to fini&s;h it. There was only one capital Actre&s;s at either Hou&s;e, who would undertake a new part in May; and, though &s;he belonged to Drury-Lane, &s;he was ca&s;t in Mi&s;s <HI>More</HI>'s Pray at Covent-Garden, in con&s;equence of the levelling power of the Coalition; and Mr. <HI>Craddock</HI>'s Play was put off 'till next &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Another Play by Mi&s;s <HI>More</HI> alarmed me greatly. The terror of &s;uffering again what I had felt at <HI>Percy,</HI> induced me to write to her in much agitation; a d I am &s;orry that I was prevented f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">om &s;ending that Letter, and induced to believe it was impo&s;&s;ible that the &s;ame palpable re&s;emblance could again happen. Under this conviction I attended the repre&s;entation, and heard with a&s;toni&s;h|ment,
<PB N="vi" REF="8">
what appeared to me to be every e&s;&s;ential circum&s;tance in the Plot, and Character, of my Play; and to ob&s;erve, that it was changed principally in tho&s;e places which had been objected to in mine. In <HI>Orlando,</HI> as in <HI>Gond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">bert,</HI> the action &s;prings from Love, which took its ri&s;e in a &s;ituation wherein Hope was im|po&s;&s;ible; though the object is changed, from the Widow of his Brother, to the betrothed Mi&s;tre&s;s of his Friend.</P>
<P>The character and offices of <HI>Editha</HI> were given, though the &s;ex was changed. From the &s;ame motive of aggrandizing his fortune, though without the &s;ame &s;timulus of a degraded &s;ituation, he worms him&s;elf into the con&s;idence of the de&s;pairing Lover, and per&s;uades him that he is &s;ecretly beloved by <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> whil&s;t &s;he receives the addre&s;&s;es of another. <HI>Orlando</HI> breaks into a rhap&s;ody &s;imilar to that of <HI>Gondibert,</HI> per&s;uades him&s;elf he had &s;een many proofs of that concealed pa&s;&s;ion, and gives him&s;elf up to the guidance of his artful Coun&s;ellor; which produces a cata|&s;trophe that is nearly the &s;ame. <HI>Orlando,</HI> in the dark, intend|ing to &s;tab <HI>Rivers,</HI> by a fortunate mi&s;take &s;tabs <HI>Bertrand;</HI> and the principal &s;ituation of the cata&s;trophe is produced exactly in the &s;ame manner in both Plays; which is, by the critical en|trance of the per&s;on &s;uppo&s;ed to be murdered. The greater part of this, however, pa&s;&s;es behind the &s;cenes in <HI>Fatal Fal&s;ehood;</HI> by which the dramatic effect is weakened; but the principal ob|jections made to mine, are removed. The character of the Si&s;ter of <HI>Rivers,</HI> and other parts of the Play, differ from mine; but there is a &s;cene between the Father and his Daughter, on her being rejected by <HI>Orlando,</HI> that bears the &s;ame re&s;emblance, in the literal expre&s;&s;ion, to the &s;cene between <HI>We&s;tmoreland</HI> and <HI>Albina,</HI> in the fourth Act of this Play, as the &s;cene in <HI>Percy</HI> did to that between him and <HI>Edward.</HI></P>
<P>How all the&s;e wonderful re&s;emblances happened, it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to know&mdash;nor do I know that Mi&s;s <HI>More</HI> ever &s;aw my Tragedy&mdash;it was in Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI>'s po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion (under the name of <HI>Edwina)</HI> &s;oon after the conclu&s;ion of the &s;ea&s;on in which he he left the Stage; about which time, I have &s;ince been in|formed, Mi&s;s <HI>More</HI> was an inmate at Hampton, and that the Play, afterwards called <HI>Percy,</HI> was then tran&s;lating. My Tra|gedy was afterwards in Mr. <HI>Harris</HI>'s Clo&s;et, at the &s;ame time with <HI>Percy,</HI> and again nearly at the &s;ame time with <HI>Fatal Fal&s;ehood.</HI> I know that Managers are continually employed in giving advice, and in &s;ugge&s;ting alternations to Authors; and I have frequently heard, before I had any experience in this anxious warfare, of the danger when once an idea is afloat in the Theatrical Hemi|&s;phere, of its getting into other plays. Amid&s;t the croud of Plots, and Stage Contrivances, in which a Manager is involv'd, <HI>recol|lection</HI> is too frequently mi&s;taken for the &s;ugge&s;tions of <HI>imagination.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="9">
Should it, after all, appear to the Public, that there is nothing more in the&s;e repeated re&s;emblances, than what may be accounted for by &s;uppo&s;ing a &s;imilarity in our minds; and that, by &s;ome <HI>wonderful</HI> coincidence, Mi&s;s <HI>More</HI> and I have but one common &s;tock of ideas between us, I have only to lament that the whole misfortune of this &s;imilarity has fallen upon me: and, as in this ca&s;e, we mu&s;t continue writing in the &s;ame track, it &s;eems rea&s;onable that we &s;hould have our productions brought forward in turn; in&s;tead of which Mi&s;s <HI>More</HI> has had two Tragedies brought out, both of which were written &s;ince mine, whil&s;t I &s;truggled for the repre&s;entation of this, in vain. But, as there &s;eems to be little hope of my obtaining this, or any other favour, from the Winter Managers, I pre&s;ume at lea&s;t, that, as I do not pretend to prove&mdash;what it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to know&mdash;that Mi&s;s <HI>More</HI> ever read, or copied me, that it will be admitted that I have not copied her; had I not been able to a&s;certain the fact, that my Tragedy was written long before <HI>Percy</HI> and <HI>Fatal Fal&s;ehood</HI> appeared, no proof would have been required, beyond their extreme &s;imilarity, that I had been guilty of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Plagiari&s;m.</P>
<P>I now found my&s;elf deprived of all hope of <HI>Albina</HI>'s appearing to the Public as an Original Play; yet I &s;till conceived my&s;elf &s;ure of its being repre&s;ented at Drury-Lane the next Sea&s;on: but I &s;oon after accidentally learnt, that Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI> had promi&s;ed another Tragedy; and, as Mr. <HI>Craddock</HI>'s had been put off, I well knew that three would not be done:&mdash;this, with his evading the &s;ubject, and &s;aying that he thought Mr. <HI>Harris</HI> would &s;till do it, reduced me to the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;king an explicit declaration, when I heard with inexpre&s;&s;ible a&s;toni&s;hment&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he neyer intended to do the Play at Drury-Lane, and that the next Sea&s;on was engaged to Mr. <HI>Craddock,</HI> and another Gen|tleman."</Q>On being reminded of his promi&s;es and encomiums, he &s;aid&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It was &s;till his opinion, that the Tragedy was a very good one, that it ought not to have been refu&s;ed, and that he had propo&s;ed to prevail on Mr. <HI>Harris</HI> after all to bring it out; but, as this had been improperly mentioned to Mr. <HI>Harris,</HI> there was now an end of it."</Q> I was then charged with having pieced conver&s;ations together, which Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI> &s;aid &s;hould never happen again; and, from the whole of his behaviour, it appeared to me that he meant this to clo&s;e his doors again&s;t me.</P>
<P>This mo&s;t injurious and unaccountable conduct appears to me to be the effect of that coalition of the Theatres, which, by uniting the intere&s;ts and prejudices of the Managers, deprives an Author of all hope, after a Piece has been rejected by <HI>one.</HI> Had Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI> been unconnected with Covent-Garden, I have no doubt, from the opinion he conceived of my Tragedy, but that it would have been brought out in a mo&s;t advantageous
<PB N="viii" REF="10">
manner. Ideas of rival&s;hip, which is the natural and proper effect of two Hou&s;es, would have been as favourable to me, as their union has been ruinous.</P>
<P>The morning &s;ucceeding my interview with Mr. <HI>Sheridan,</HI> Mr. <HI>Colman</HI> was a&s;ked to bring out a Tragedy for me, at the Haymarket, which both the Winter Managers had refu&s;ed.

<P>This candid and liberal an&s;wer I have great plea&s;ure in re|cording. The Tragedy, when read, drew an approbation not le&s;s warm from Mr. <HI>Colman,</HI> than from Mr. <HI>Sheridan:</HI> and it was not merely prai&s;e; Mr. <HI>Colman</HI> put it into immediate rehear|&s;al, for which I think my&s;elf under the highe&s;t obligation, as Tragedy is incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;portive Genius of the <HI>Haymarket;</HI> and there was little hope of advantage equal to the expen&s;ive pre|paration of a regular Tragedy. It was however pre&s;ented, with no other alteration than the curtailments, which were nece&s;&s;ary, on account of the length, where the time of repre&s;entation is &s;horter than in the Winter Theatres&mdash;and with the di&s;advantage of ha|ving one of its principal <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Editha;</HI> &s;ince given to Mi&s;s <HI>Sherry.</HI></NOTE> Characters performed in a &s;tyle which excited laughter; yet it was received with a degree of applau&s;e, for which I &s;hould be ungrateful, were I not vain of it.</P>
<P>Had I taken up my pen merely in pur&s;uit of applau&s;e, I &s;hould have been completely gratified; but this, though &s;o o&s;tentatiou&s;ly held out as the motive for productions in the Poetic line, has &s;eldom, in any age or country, produced works of any con&s;ider|able reputation. Dramatic Writers, in particular, have always &s;ought for &s;upport from their labour, which is too great to be undertaken for amu&s;ement. This may appear a vulgar topic; but to me it is a very &s;erious &s;ubject of complaint, that, by the conduct of the Winter Managers, I have been deprived of a rea|&s;onable pro&s;pect of &s;everal hundred pounds, and have &s;pent years of fruitle&s;s anxiety and trouble. My productions have been uniformly received by the Public with applau&s;e; yet I find the doors of the Winter Theatres &s;hut again&s;t me.&mdash;To this &s;evere fate I mo&s;t reluctantly &s;ubmit.</P>
