<HEAD>A DISSERTATION UPON PAMPHLETS, And the UNDERTAKING of <HI>PHOENIX BRITANNICUS,</HI> To <HI>Revive</HI> the mo&s;t EXCELLENT among Them.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In a LETTER to a NOBLEMAN: From the Original <HI>M. S.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Inclination you have expre&s;&s;ed, to hear what might be &s;aid, in Behalf of tho&s;e mo&s;t numerous Productions of our Pre&s;s, which we di&s;tingui&s;h by the Name of PAMPHLETS; and the pre&s;ent <HI>Undertaking,</HI> by the Compiler of <HI>PHOENIX BRITANNICUS,</HI> to Revive the mo&s;t Excellent among them; has induced me thus briefly, to touch upon tho&s;e Particu|lars which &s;eemed mo&s;t to attract your <HI>Lord&s;hip</HI>'s Inquiry; hoping the Readine&s;s of my Endeavour will atone for the Imperfections of my Performance; which, if it does not <HI>equal</HI> the Exten&s;ions of your Curio&s;ity, may <HI>add</HI> to the In&s;tances of your Candour: So that, where you find not Entertainment commen&s;urate to your <HI>Knowledge,</HI> you will not fail of Exerci&s;e corre&s;pondent to your <HI>Goodne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>And, Fir&s;t, for the <HI>Derivation</HI> of the Word <HI>Pamphlet:</HI> I &s;hould think it little di&s;credited by what &s;ome <HI>Etymologi&s;ts,</HI> and tho&s;e who torture Words into Confe&s;&s;ions of what they were never guilty, have, thro' the Confinement of them&s;elves to &s;ome opprobrious Signification, cen&s;oriou&s;ly &s;ugge&s;ted thereof. Thus one Lingui&s;t, having found a Word which will illu&s;trate the Adaptne&s;s of the&s;e Writings to the vulgar Con&s;ultation of the Populace, would derive it from <GAP DESC="foreign"> and <GAP DESC="foreign">, as <HI>fil|ling all</HI> Places, which all vulgar and popular Things have the Property of doing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Min&s;heu</HI>'s Guide to Tongues, <HI>Fol. 1627.</HI></NOTE>. Ano|ther Original, no le&s;s &s;pecious, has been offered me, by an ingenious Friend, from <GAP DESC="foreign"> and <GAP DESC="foreign">, which, by a Grammatical Turn, reaches to the Analogy of <HI>Sound,</HI> and, by a Rhetorical Twi&s;t, to the plau&s;ible Sen&s;e of <HI>inflaming all</HI> Parties. But others, con&s;idering the Subject of <HI>Pamphlets</HI> in a more copious and unbia&s;&s;ed Latitude, as having branched into all other Parts of Science, be&s;ides <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Politics,</HI> from the fir&s;t Appropriation of the Name, and before their Engagement in Controver&s;y could draw upon them any prevailing <HI>Sobriquet</HI> to their Di&s;paragement, have, with le&s;s Partiality, concluded of the&s;e Tracts, who&s;e Contents, therefore, as well as Di|men&s;ions,
<PB N="2" REF="3">
are &s;o generally engaging to all Writers and Readers, &s;o much more uni|ver&s;ally &s;uited to every Body's Peru&s;al, to every Body's Purcha&s;e, that the Name is more properly derivable from <GAP DESC="foreign"> and <GAP DESC="foreign">, as if they were a Kind of Compo&s;i|tion, <HI>beloved by,</HI> or <HI>delighting all</HI> People<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Icon Libellorum in Pref.</NOTE>. But, notwith&s;tanding this favourable De|rivation, I &s;hould not be for going to <HI>Athens</HI> after one, or &s;eeking it in any other of the more ancient Languages, &s;eeing <HI>that</HI> Word <HI>Pampier,</HI> for <HI>Paper,</HI> in one more Modern, more probable to me (as it &s;eemed before, to one of our mo&s;t indu&s;trious <HI>Glo&s;&s;ographers)</HI> for <HI>this</HI> of <HI>Pamphlet,</HI> to be derived from <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Skinneri</HI> Etymologicon Ling. Ang. <HI>Fol. 1671.</HI></NOTE>; the la&s;t Letter of the fir&s;t Syllable being interwoven by <HI>Epenthe&s;is,</HI> to mollify the Sound; and the la&s;t Sylla|ble &s;ub&s;tituted, as a noted Term of Diminution in many Languages<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ib. in Voc. <HI>Let.</HI> &amp; Sir <HI>Hen. Spelman</HI>'s Glo&s;&s;.</NOTE>; with the &s;ame Difference of Interpretation, as between <HI>Charta</HI> and <HI>Chartula,</HI> or <HI>Papyrus</HI> and <HI>Papy|rulus:</HI> Thus, al&s;o, in <HI>French,</HI> the Diminutive of the Word <HI>Livre,</HI> for a Book it&s;elf, is <HI>Livret</HI>; and thus, in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> we have <HI>Aglet, Amulet, Bracelet, Chaplet, Cor&s;let, Eaglet, Gafflet, Hamlet, Howlet, Oilet, Pallet, Pullet, Ringlet, Rivulet,</HI> and Twenty more, with like Terminations to the &s;ame Sen&s;e. Now, this Extraction, be&s;ides the Plea of Precedent, has the farther Recommendations to our Preference, of not ante|dating the Familiarity of <HI>Graeci&s;ms</HI> in our Tongue, and withal of deriving it&s;elf from the more apparent, and determinable Quality, of the Size or Sub&s;tance, rather than the Subject Matter, of the&s;e more exiguous Compo&s;itions. And thus the Word <HI>Pam|phlet,</HI> or <HI>little Paper</HI> Book, imports no reproachful Character, any more than the Word <HI>Great</HI> Book; &s;ignifies a Pa&s;quil, as little as it does a Panegyric, of it&s;elf: Is neither Good nor Bad, Learned nor Illiterate, True nor Fal&s;e, Serious nor Jocular, of its own naked Meaning, or Con&s;truction; but is either of them, according as the Subject makes the Di&s;tinction. Thus, of &s;currilous and abu&s;ive <HI>Pamphlets,</HI> to be burned in 1647, we read in <HI>Ru&s;hworth</HI>; and, by the Name of <HI>Pamphlet,</HI> is the <HI>En|comium</HI> of Queen <HI>Emma</HI> called in <HI>Hollin&s;hed.</HI></P>
<P>As for the <HI>Antiquity</HI> of <HI>Pamphlets,</HI> it is not only que&s;tionable, whether the Art of <HI>Printing</HI> &s;hould &s;et a Bound to it, but even the very Adoption of the Name it&s;elf; which yet I take to be more Modern than that Art: For I look upon them as the elde&s;t Offspring of Paper, and to claim the Rights of <HI>Primogeniture</HI> even of Bound Volumes, however they may be &s;horter-liv'd, and the Younger Brother has &s;o much out-grown the Elder; in-as-much as Arguments do now, and more e&s;pecially did, in the Minority of our Erudition, not only &s;o much more rarely require a larger Com|pa&s;s than Pamphlets will compri&s;e; but the&s;e being of a more ready and facil, more decent and &s;imple Form, &s;uitable to the Character of the more Artle&s;s Ages, they &s;eem to have been preferred by our mode&s;t Ance&s;try for the Communication of their Sen|timents, before Book-Writing became a <HI>Trade</HI>; and Lucre, or Vanity let in De|luges of Digre&s;&s;ory Learning, to &s;well up unweildy <HI>Folio's.</HI> Thus I find, not a a little to the Honour of our Subject, no le&s;s a Per&s;on than the Renowned King <HI>AELFRED,</HI> collecting his Sage Precepts, and Divine Sentences, with his own Royal Hand, into <HI>Quaternions of Leaves &s;titched together</HI><NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sir</HI> John Spelman<HI>'s Life of</HI> Aelfred <HI>the Great,</HI> p. 205.</NOTE>; which he would inlarge with additional <HI>Quaternions,</HI> as Occa&s;ion offered; yet &s;eemed he to keep his Collection &s;o much within the Limits of a <HI>Pamphlet</HI>-Size (however bound together at la&s;t) that he called it by the Name of his <HI>Hand-Book,</HI> becau&s;e he made it his con&s;tant Compa|nion, and had it at Hand wherever he was.</P>
<P>It is &s;o difficult to recover even any of our fir&s;t Books, or <HI>Volumes,</HI> which were Printed by <HI>William Caxton,</HI> though it is certain he &s;et forth near Half a Hundred of them in <HI>Folio,</HI> that it were a Wonder if his <HI>Pamphlets</HI> &s;hould not be quite lo&s;t.
<PB N="3" REF="4">
There are more extant of his Succe&s;&s;or <HI>Wynkin de Worde</HI>'s Printing in this le&s;&s;er Form, whereof, as great Rarities, I have &s;een both in <HI>Quarto</HI> and <HI>Octavo,</HI> tho' holding no Compari&s;on, probably, with tho&s;e of his al&s;o, which are de&s;troyed. But it was the Ir|ruption of the Grand Controver&s;y between the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and the fir&s;t Op|po&s;ers thereof, which &s;eems to have laid the great Foundation of this Kind of Writ|ing, and to have given great Credit to it at the &s;ame Time, as well by the many eminent Authors it produced in <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State,</HI> as the &s;ucce&s;sful Detection and Defeat, thereby befalling tho&s;e religious Impo&s;tures, which had &s;o univer&s;ally in&s;laved the Minds of Men. Nay, this important Reformation, has been much a&s;cribed to one little Pamphlet only, which a certain Lawyer of <HI>Grey</HI>'s-Inn, obliged to fly into <HI>Germany</HI> (for having acted in a <HI>Play</HI> which incen&s;ed Cardinal <HI>Wol&s;ey</HI>) compo&s;ed there, and conveyed by Means of the Lady <HI>Anne Bullen,</HI> to the Peru&s;al of King <HI>Henry,</HI> at the Beginning of the &s;aid Rupture<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Simon Fi&s;h</HI>'s Supplication of Beggars, <HI>12^o^. 1524.</HI></NOTE>, and how the Copies thereof were &s;trewed about, at the King's Proce&s;&s;ion to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> (the fir&s;t Example, as &s;ome think, of that Kind of Appeal to the Public) how the Cardinal was nettled thereat; how he endeavoured to &s;tifle and &s;ecrete the &s;ame; how it provoked the Pen of the bigotted Lord Chancellor <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Sir <HI>Tho.

Had <HI>Phoenix Britannicus</HI> been alive a <HI>Century</HI> pa&s;t, or half a one &s;ooner, we might have had a better <HI>Knowledge</HI> of that va&s;t Num|ber of Pamphlets, which <HI>Montaigne</HI> mentions <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;aye &s;ur la Defen&s;e de <HI>Seneque,</HI> et de <HI>Plutarque.</HI></NOTE>, and whereof he intimates many to have been &s;o ingeniou&s;ly written, on the afore&s;aid Controver&s;y of the <HI>Reforma|tion,</HI> than it is now po&s;&s;ible we &s;hall ever arrive at even the <HI>Names</HI> of.</P>
<P>But, as <HI>England,</HI> thro' its Spirit of Liberty, has been the mo&s;t fruitful Coun|try, for the Production of Pamphlets, &s;o the Period which has been mo&s;t fruitful in them, was that of our <HI>Civil Wars,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t. And, indeed, in all Di&s;orders, or Commotions, it is natural to have Recour&s;e to the mo&s;t expeditious Intelligence and Redre&s;s, le&s;t the Delay &s;hould be more dangerous than the Deficiency of them; or they, &s;uperannuated before they are born. For, while &s;ome Per&s;ons are labouring in the <HI>Paroxy&s;ms</HI> of Contention, were others to be pondering long-winded Expedients of Accommodation, and pre&s;cribe a Volume for a <HI>Recipe,</HI> the Do&s;e would come too late for the Di&s;ea&s;e, and the very Preparation thereof di&s;|able its Efficacy. Therefore are Pamphlets, and &s;uch &s;hort Tracts, ri&s;e&s;t in great Revolutions; which tho' looked upon, by &s;ome, but as <HI>Paper Lanterns,</HI> &s;et a fly|ing to be gaped at by the Multitude (in illuminating whom, they have not always e&s;caped the Flames them&s;elves) yet are they beheld, by politic, or penetrating Eyes,

as the <HI>Thermometers</HI> of <HI>State,</HI> fore-&s;hewing the Temperature and Changes of Govern|ment, with the <HI>Calentures</HI> approaching therein, and even Pre&s;ervatives to be had again&s;t them, would the <HI>Active</HI> be as unanimous to prevent, as the <HI>Speculative</HI> have been indu&s;trious to progno&s;ticate the &s;ame. Tho' there may not remain as eminent Proofs among the Pamphleteers in the afore&s;aid <HI>Anarchy,</HI> of an Ambition to Unanimity, as there are to Di&s;&s;ention: For, &s;urely, no Nation, has ever given more con&s;picuous In|&s;tances, to what immea&s;urable Lengths, Animo&s;ity, and Indignation will advance, upon the lea&s;t Impo&s;ition, or even Umbrage of Tyrannical or Arbitrary Power; as might be exemplified, among many others, in the re&s;tle&s;s <HI>John Lilburn,</HI> and the endle&s;s <HI>William Prynne,</HI> who had both been bleeding Witne&s;&s;es thereof. There are near a Hundred Pamphlets, written by, and concerning the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e Authors: But the Labours of the <HI>la&s;t</HI> being unparallel'd, I may here not improperly ob&s;erve, that during the <HI>Forty-two</HI> Years he was a Writer, he publi&s;hed above a <HI>Hundred</HI> and <HI>Sixty</HI> Pamphlets, be&s;ides &s;everal thick Bound Volumes in <HI>Quarto</HI> and <HI>Folio,</HI> all &s;aid to be gathered into about <HI>Forty</HI> Tomes, and extant in <HI>Lincoln</HI>'s-Inn Library.

Year 1640, to the Beginning of 1660, it appears, there were publi&s;hed, in that Space, near <HI>Thirty Thou&s;and</HI> &s;everal Tracts, and that the&s;e were not the compleat I&s;&s;ue of that Period, there is good Pre&s;umption, and, I believe, Proofs in Being: Notwith|&s;tanding, it is enriched with near a Hundred Manu&s;cripts, which no Body then (being written on the Side of the <HI>Royali&s;ts</HI>) would venture to put in Print; the Whole, however, for it is yet undi&s;per&s;ed, is progre&s;&s;ionally and uniformly Bound, in upwards of <HI>Two Thou&s;and Volumes,</HI> of all Sizes.

Plainly demon&s;trating, <HI>that</HI> unrea&s;on|able Value aro&s;e not from any rich Mines of Knowledge, which the &s;carce Part would communicate, from nothing intrin&s;ically Curious, or In&s;tructive in it; nor even any material U&s;e to be made of it; but merely from the empty Property of its Sin|gularity, and being, as the contending Purcha&s;ers fondly apprehended, no where el&s;e recoverable.</P>
<P>Several other Tracts, be&s;ides tho&s;e before &s;pecified, I could mention, which the Retailers of them have prized at their Weight in Gold, and for which, more Pounds have been exacted, than, probably, they ever yielded Pence, at their fir&s;t Publica|tion. But I refrain being too Particular, le&s;t I &s;hould, too inadvertently, give Handles for Extortion on one Side, or too di&s;tinctly expo&s;e this Dotage of Curio&s;ity on the other; neverthele&s;s, I may hereupon &s;ea&s;onably ob&s;erve, and the rather, becau&s;e I have had Your LORDSHIP's Noble Concurrence, that this <HI>Caco-zealous</HI> Curio&s;ity it is; which has, of late, been deemed &s;o ob&s;tructive to the Advancement of Know|ledge, in a Set of reputed <HI>Literati,</HI> who make no more U&s;e of the Books they are be&s;et with in their Studies, than <HI>Eunuchs,</HI> of the Beauties which inviron them in the <HI>Seraglio</HI>; yet can never re&s;t till they have gathered them&s;elves <HI>Libraries</HI> to doze in; like Children, who will not be quiet without <HI>Lights</HI> to <HI>&s;leep</HI> by. But tho&s;e, who are thus di&s;ea&s;ed, would do well to con&s;ider, while they monopolize &s;uch Collections as would exten&s;ively benefit the Republic of Letters, and bury them in the narrow Circuit of their own private, and uncon&s;equentional Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, only becau&s;e they have
<PB N="7" REF="8">
<HI>great</HI> Fortunes which will impower them to do it, how detrimental they may be to indu&s;trious and ingenious Scholars, of <HI>&s;mall</HI> ones, who really want them for public and important U&s;es; while the mercenary Sale&s;men, making no Di&s;tinction, but a general Rule of Valuation, from the particular Payments of one prodigal Pur|cha&s;er, is incouraged to part with nothing to any Body el&s;e, at the intrin&s;ic, or mo|derate Value: Whereas, if there were no extravagant <HI>Buyers</HI> of Books, there would be no extortionate <HI>Sellers</HI> of them.

<P>The extraordinary Price of Pamphlets afore&s;aid, would naturally excite our more deliberate Enquiry into what has been mo&s;t extraordinary in the Contents of them; but &s;o multifarious are the Subjects they comprehend, that it cannot be expected I &s;hould even enumerate the &s;ame, in the narrow Limits of this <HI>Epi&s;tolary Addre&s;s.</HI> What do mo&s;t attract the Attention of Mankind, are tho&s;e dreaded Scourges of Male-Ad|mini&s;tration, commonly, tho' perhaps, &s;ometimes too indi&s;criminately, bearing the contu|melious Denomination of <HI>Libels.</HI> It matters little whether it appears to me Rea&s;ona|ble, or not, that &s;uch Writings, as duly expo&s;e Villany, &s;hould them&s;elves be held vile; or that &s;ome Per&s;ons, who have been unju&s;tly Injurious, by any other Means, may not be ju&s;tly injured by this: But it is obvious to all, who know the Di&s;proportion of Riches and Power in the World, that there are Crimes not to be bla&s;ted, and Criminals not to be branded by any other Means.

<P><PB N="9" REF="10">Thus much for the Topics and Arguments ari&s;ing from tho&s;e Examples and Au|thorities, which have occurred, as mo&s;t ob&s;ervable, upon this &s;udden Recollection, to illu&s;trate my <HI>pre&s;ent Subject.</HI> What remains to be &s;aid of <HI>Pamphlets,</HI> will more e&s;pecially regard the <HI>pre&s;ent Undertaking,</HI> to make a &s;elect Revival of them. The Approbation whereof may be grounded on the&s;e Con&s;iderations.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The Regard we owe to the Pre&s;ervation of Good Writings in general, and to their Separation from the Bad: But more in particular to the&s;e. For, if the Re-printing of good old <HI>Books</HI> is commendable, much more is that of good old <HI>Pamphlets</HI>; they being, not to mention the greater Ea&s;e of the Expence, really more in Want of &s;uch Ju&s;tice, to remove that mean Opinion which &s;ome, unread therein, have more indi&s;tinctly entertained of them <HI>all,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>many</HI> indeed are but meanly written; tho' the Proportion is not greater than in Books: And for tho&s;e Pamphlets which really are <HI>well</HI> written (as abundance &s;ufficient for any &s;uch Undertaking have been, by the able&s;t Pens, upon the mo&s;t emergent Points, however they daily pe|ri&s;h in the common Wreck, for Want of a helping Hand) they cannot be denied a ju&s;t Claim to this Care.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly</HI>; Becau&s;e they &s;tand in greater Need of &s;uch Care, than Writings better &s;ecured by their Bulk and Bindings do. Many good old Family-Books are de&s;cended to us, who&s;e Backs and Sides our careful Grand-&s;ires Buff'd, and Bo&s;s'd, and Board|ed again&s;t the Teeth of Time, or more devouring Ignorance, and who&s;e Leaves they guarded with <HI>Bra&s;s,</HI> nay, <HI>Silver</HI> Cla&s;ps, again&s;t the A&s;&s;aults of Worm and Wea|ther: But the&s;e defen&s;ele&s;s Conduits of Adverti&s;ement are &s;o much more obnoxious, by rea&s;on of their Nakedne&s;s and Debility, to all de&s;tructive Ca&s;ualties, that it is more rare and difficult, for Want of a proper <HI>A&s;ylum,</HI> to meet with &s;ome <HI>Tracts</HI> which have not been Printed Ten Years, than with many <HI>Books</HI> which are more than ten Times their Age.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly</HI>; As being the livelie&s;t Pictures of their Times. <HI>Pamphlets</HI> having this con&s;iderable Advantage, that &s;pringing u&s;ually from &s;ome immediate Occa&s;ion, they are copied more directly from the Life; &s;o likelier to bear a Re&s;emblance, than any more extended Draughts taken by a remoter Light. But being therefore a Kind of Reading <HI>&agrave; la Mode,</HI> and the Events, their Sources, &s;o &s;uddenly giving Way to every fre&s;h Current of Affairs, it is no Wonder if the&s;e little Maps of them are, in like Man|ner, over-borne, and become as tran&s;ient as they: And yet whenever the Political Wheel rouls into any of its former Tracks, or pre&s;ent Occurrences tally with tho&s;e of pa&s;t Times, doubtle&s;s what was <HI>then</HI> advanced for the Public Good, might <HI>now</HI> be conducive thereto: Whereas the Di&s;orders of former Times revive, and the Remedies which were pre&s;cribed again&s;t them are to &s;eek; many, as well plea&s;ant as profitable, being lo&s;t merely for Want of Revival.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly</HI>; The true&s;t Images of their Authors. For, Pamphlets running &s;o often upon new, particular, and unprecedented Subjects, the Writers have le&s;s Opportunity to <HI>commit,</HI> and their Writings are le&s;s liable to <HI>admit</HI> &s;uch foul and frequent Practi|&s;es of <HI>Plagiary,</HI> as Books of Matter more Various, and Bulk more Voluminous, too often exhibit. Be&s;ides, the Author being more vigorou&s;ly prompted to Applica|tion, by the Expediency of bringing forth his Work opportunely <Q>is urged (as has been el&s;ewhere &s;aid upon another Occa&s;ion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay on Epi&s;tolary Writings, <HI>&amp;c. 8</HI>vo, <HI>M. S.</HI></NOTE>) to &s;trike out the Images of his Mind at a Heat, in the mo&s;t natural Form and Symmetry, in the mo&s;t &s;ignificant Cir|cum&s;tances at once; &s;eldom allowing Lei&s;ure for the Writer to doat upon, or dream over his Work: neither to di&s;gui&s;e it with the Conceptions of other Men, nor to deform it with Chimeras of his own.</Q> Hence are they preferred by many
<PB N="10" REF="11">
Critics, to di&s;cover the genuine Abilities of an Author, before his more dilatory and accumulated Productions.</P>
<P>The&s;e, be&s;ides many other Arguments which might be deduced from the commo|dious Brevity, the va&s;t Choice, or Variety of well-written <HI>Pamphlets,</HI> more particu|larly their regretted Di&s;per&s;ion, Con&s;umption and Ob&s;curity; but, above all, the many &s;urpri&s;ing Scenes to be unfolded, and brought in View, by &s;elect and public Collec|tions, from the rich but di&s;regarded Store, are, in my Opinion, &s;ufficient Recom|mendations to the Encouragement of &s;uch a Revival. What few Attempts have hi|therto been made, &s;eem either of a &s;hort-&s;ighted Nature, or of one too unbounded. Thus <HI>Edward Husband,</HI> circum&s;cribes him&s;elf to the Speeches and Ordinances of Par|liament, in a few Years of K. <HI>Charles</HI> I. As the Collections in K. <HI>Charles</HI> II. and K. <HI>William</HI>'s Reigns, contain only &s;ome <HI>State-Tracts</HI> of tho&s;e Times. And, for <HI>John Dunton</HI>'s Collection, it might have &s;ucceeded better, had he not been for rambling into foreign, or heavy and unaffecting Subjects. But the Undertaking mo&s;t likely to &s;ucceed, is one wholly unconfined, as to Time, and only confined to Matter dome&s;tically applicable; provided the Undertaker chu&s;es judiciou&s;ly his Materials. And, certainly, the Public might &s;oon be obliged with a very valuable Collection, if in tho&s;e Particulars whereof the Collector's own Store &s;hould be deficient, he were &s;upplied by &s;uch Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the&s;e Curio&s;ities, as have a Reli&s;h for the Project: Which may be farther rendered a convenient Receptacle for the Re&s;toration of what is not only rare and remarkable, but pertinent and &s;ea&s;onable.</P>
<P>And &s;uch, among others, are the Advantages promi&s;ed us by the pre&s;ent <HI>PHOENIX</HI>; which, if it ever grows into a Volume, and is accommodated with a compleat <HI>In|dex,</HI> I cannot help fancying, we &s;hall imagine our&s;elves led into new and untrodden Paths; into Regions of neglected but notable Intelligence, which, having lain long dormant, and widely remote from ordinary Ob&s;ervation, will look like a &s;udden Re|&s;urrection of Characters and De&s;criptions, Schemes and Di&s;coveries; or rather a Kind of Re-Creation of them in the Land of <HI>Literature:</HI> So that it may yield the be&s;t Comment upon pa&s;t Times, and become the grand Expo&s;itor of many Incidents, which General Hi&s;torians are either wholly ignorant of, or very &s;uperficially mention.</P>
<P>Thus, my LORD, you have the free, but undige&s;ted <HI>Thoughts</HI> of one totally di&s;inte|re&s;ted in the Undertaking afore&s;aid, and no otherwi&s;e concerned for the &s;ame, than as a Well-wi&s;her to what I cannot but think may be of public Utility: And the ju&s;ter Title they may have to your favourable Cen&s;ure, as being the immediate Con&s;e|quence of your Commands. I might, indeed, have farther inlarged on a Theme &s;o fruitful; but in handling the Subject of <HI>Pamphlets,</HI> it may not be di&s;commendable to conform my &s;elf to their Size: For, <Q>Inter Pygmaeos non pudet e&s;&s;e brevem.</Q> More e&s;pecially when I con&s;ider, that I may have already tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed farther upon your Lord&s;hip's Patience, than will admit of an Apology from</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your LORDSHIP's, <HI>&amp;c. W. Oldys.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
