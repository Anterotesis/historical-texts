<HEAD>AN ENQUIRY INTO Occa&s;ional Conformity.</HEAD>
<P>HE that Oppo&s;es his own Judgment again&s;t the Current of the Times, ought to be back'd with unan&s;wer|able Truths; and he that has that Truth on his Side, is a Fool, as well as a Coward, if he is afraid to own it becau&s;e of the Currency or Multitude of other Mens Opinion.</P>
<P>'Tis hard for a Man to &s;ay, all the World is Mi&s;taken but him&s;elf; but if it be &s;o who can help it?</P>
<P>But &s;ince 'tis not likely a Single Vote &s;hou'd prevail upon E&s;pous'd Errors, in an Age when every one is &s;o fond of them&s;elves, he that Starts Truth by him&s;elf mu&s;t expect the World will &s;tand &s;till and look on till they &s;ee the I&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
The Act depending in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons about Occa&s;ional Conformity has &s;et abundance of Heads to Work in the World; and be the Hou&s;e in the Right, or in the Wrong, I know my own Bu&s;ine&s;s, and their Temper, too well to meddle with it: But I pretend to &s;ay, that all Men I have met with, who have meddled with the Ar|gument, either in Print or otherwi&s;e, are manife&s;tly Mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>With more Humility therefore than I owe to any Man, I ask leave not to be Cen&s;ur'd till I am Heard; and tho&s;e who call me Ar|rogant before, reprove me with more Ar|rogance than is their &s;hare among their Fel|low Creatures.</P>
<P>But &s;ince I, <HI>who was altogether Born in Sin,</HI> have Undertaken to teach my Superiors, I de&s;ire to explain my &s;elf before they ca&s;t me out of the Synagogue.</P>
<P>For as that blind Man thought 'twas a Marvellous thing they &s;hould not know whence he came that had opened his Eyes.</P>
<P>So to me 'tis every jot as wonderful to find no Body of my Mind, and yet be Po&s;itively a&s;&s;ured that I am in the Right.</P>
<P>The Subject I am upon needs no Introdu|ction, the Hi&s;tory is in every Man's Know|ledge; the Parliament are upon a Bill to prevent Occa&s;ional Conformity, and about that Bill the Pre&s;s &s;warms with Pamphlets;
<PB N="5" REF="4">
the Pulpit &s;ounds with Exultations on one Hand, and Deprecations on the other; eve|ry one &s;peak their Opinions, &s;ome their Hopes, &s;ome their Fears; and &s;o it &s;hou'd have been to the End of the Chapter, if I cou'd have found but one middle Sort, that, free from Prejudice of Parties, cou'd have di&s;cern'd the Native State of the Ca&s;e as it really is, di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the Pa&s;&s;ions and Follies of Men.</P>
<P>About this Act of Parliament I affirm mo&s;t of the People I have met with are Mi&s;taken; and that I may be as Explicit as I can, I &s;hall enquire more particularly who are Mi&s;taken, how, and then I doubt not the Sequel of this Paper &s;hall make it ap|pear that the Fact is true.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> All tho&s;e People who de&s;ign'd the Act as a Blow to the Di&s;&s;enting Intere&s;t in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> are Mi&s;taken.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> All tho&s;e who take it as a Prelude or Introduction to the further Suppre&s;&s;ing of the Di&s;&s;enters, and a Step to Repealing the Toleration, or intend it as &s;uch, are Mi&s;taken.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> All tho&s;e who think the Di&s;&s;en|ters at all Concern'd in it, or have de&s;ign'd to Mortifie them by it, are Mi&s;taken.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> All tho&s;e Hot-Spurs of Divinity who Prophe&s;ie De&s;truction from the Pulpit, and from this Step pretend to foretel that the time of Plund'ring their Brethren is at Hand, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5">
<HI>Fifthly,</HI> All tho&s;e Flegmatick Di&s;&s;enters who fancy them&s;elves undone, and that Per|&s;ecution and De&s;olation is at the Door again, are Mi&s;taken.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> All tho&s;e Di&s;&s;enters who are really at all Di&s;turb'd at it, either as an Advantage gain'd by their Enemies, or as a real Di&s;a&s;ter upon them&s;elves, are Mi&s;taken.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> All tho&s;e Di&s;&s;enters who Depre|cate it as a Judgment, or wou'd Vote again&s;t it, if it were in their Power, are Mi&s;taken.</P>
<P><HI>Eighthly,</HI> That all tho&s;e who begun or pro|moted this Bill with a de&s;ign to Ruin, Weaken and De&s;troy, the Intere&s;t or Body of the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England,</HI> are Mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>Not that I hereby &s;uppo&s;e the Parliament, or the Per&s;ons Originally concern'd in mo|ving this Bill, did it in meer Kindne&s;s to the Di&s;&s;enters, in order to Refine and Purge them from the Scandals which &s;ome People had brought upon them, that 'twas an Action of Chri&s;tian Charity to the Di&s;&s;enters to Prevent and Detect Frauds and Hypocri&s;ie in Religion, and to clear their Reputation.</P>
<P>I never yet &s;aw or read of a Divi&s;ion of Parties in any Nation, but that the Hot Heads of both Parties were always for En|flaming the Reckoning; if the Hot Men of the Di&s;&s;enters have done any Mi&s;chief, I am &s;orry for it; but let us Examine a little what other Hot Men wou'd be now a doing</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">
No &s;ooner was Queen <HI>Anne</HI> &s;etl'd upon the Throne of <HI>England,</HI> and had declar'd that the Church of <HI>England</HI> &s;hou'd be the Men of Her Favour, as being the Church She had been Educated in, and ever Con&s;tant to, but the&s;e Hot Men fly out upon their Brethren with all the Exce&s;&s;es of their furious Temper.</P>
<P>Nothing wou'd &s;erve them, but this Queen, and this Parliament, mu&s;t, Root and Branch, bla&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters with their Breath, blow up their Intere&s;t in the Nation, and we &s;hou'd be all one Church, and one People, of a &s;udden; 'twas to be done with a Blow all at once, and &s;o certainly, that no po&s;&s;ible Doubt could be made of it.</P>
<P>But Her Maje&s;ty was pleas'd to let the&s;e People know from Her own Mouth, that for as much as concern'd Her, they were Mi&s;taken; in that, upon the Addre&s;s of the Di&s;&s;enters to Her, She gave them Her Roy|al Word for Her Protection, and whenever She breaks it, we &s;hall all be Mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>Upon this the Pulpit, that Drum Eccle&s;i|a&s;tick began the War, and Mr. <HI>Sachavrell,</HI> in his Sermon at <HI>Oxford,</HI> Dooms all the Di&s;&s;en|ters to De&s;truction, without either Bell, Book or Candle; not regarding common De|cency, not re&s;pecting his good Manners to the Queen, nor his Deference to the Parlia|ment; but tells them 'tis their Duty, if they will be true Members of the Church of <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="7">
to lift up a Standard again&s;t the Pha|naticks, and the like; as much as to &s;ay, <HI>Ma|dam, whatever Your Maje&s;ty has promis'd, You mu&s;t break Your Word;</HI> and, <HI>Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Commons, we will have you do it.</HI></P>
<P>Now all the&s;e Gentlemen have liv'd to &s;ee them&s;elves Mi&s;taken; and if they retain any Expectations of &s;eeing it fulfill'd, they mu&s;t exerci&s;e their Faith upon it, as a thing <HI>in Fu|turo,</HI> and believe that &s;ome time or other Her Maje&s;ty will break Her Word; but as yet there is no great Probability, for hitherto we have &s;een they are all Mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>But to revive their Expectations, comes a Bill into the Hou&s;e for preventing Occa&s;ional Conformity; this has been Matter of great Tri|umph to &s;ome Gentlemen, who, upon this Act, revive their common Di&s;cour&s;e, and are pleas'd to treat the Di&s;&s;enters in this manner: <HI>Well, Gentlemen, now down you go; the Parliament are a beginning with you, and they don't u&s;e to do Bu&s;ine&s;s by halves; they have taken the in&s;ulted Church into Con&s;ideration; they will reduce you, and this is the fir&s;t Step; you &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee &s;ome more on't: We have got a Church-Parliament now, and down ye go; this Bill will effectually Ruin your Intere&s;t, and bring all your Great Men off from you.</HI></P>
<P>This brings us clo&s;e to the Point; and 'tis no &s;mall Matter for any one to &s;how the&s;e Gentlemen how they are Mi&s;taken.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8">
<HI>First,</HI> 'Tis time for the&s;e Gentlemen to tell us what the Parliament will do when they either know it, or the Hou&s;e has declar'd their Intentions; and till they have, 'tis a Pre&s;umption &s;ome Hou&s;es would have taken Notice of, for any People to pretend to lead them to their Bu&s;ine&s;s; and therefore when they tell us this is a Ta&s;te of the re&s;t they are preparing for us, I mu&s;t &s;ay, either they are too well acquainted with the Mind of the Hou&s;e, or they are all Mi&s;taken; and as to the Blow this Bill is to the Di&s;&s;enters Inte|re&s;t in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>As far as I may be allow'd to give my Judgment, and as the Nature of the Thing &s;eems to &s;peak its &s;elf, 'tis plain this Bill is no Damage at all to the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England,</HI> and we hope the Hou&s;e did not intend it as &s;uch.</P>
<P>I cannot imagine that &s;o great a Spirit of Enmity and Contempt can be entertain'd in the Brea&s;t of a Nation again&s;t their Neigh|bours, their Brethren, People Born in the &s;ame Climate, &s;ubmitting to the &s;ame Go|vernment, profe&s;&s;ing the &s;ame God, and in mo&s;t Fundamental Points of Religion agree|ing, People link'd together in the &s;ame Com|mon Intere&s;t, by Intermarriages continually mixt in Relation, concern'd in the &s;ame Trade, making War with the &s;ame Enemies, and Allied with the &s;ame Friends; were it
<PB N="10" REF="9">
not that the&s;e People, call'd Di&s;&s;enters, are repre&s;ented to them under &s;ome &s;trange and untrue Character, or that under the Name of Di&s;&s;enter &s;ome ill Per&s;ons are &s;hrowded and di&s;guis'd, who de&s;erve to be thus treated.</P>
<P>Wherefore, in order to &s;et the Di&s;&s;enters Right in the Eyes of their Brethren, and that they may have common Ju&s;tice at lea&s;t, if they can have nothing of Courte&s;ie, that Peace may be where there is no Occa&s;ion for War, and Quietne&s;s, and good Manners, pre&s;erv'd, 'twill be needful to &s;et the Mat|ter in a true Light, and examine who this Di&s;&s;enter is, what the People call'd Di&s;&s;en|ters are, and what they have done, for which they are treated after &s;o Infamous a Manner, by Scurrilous Preachers, and Scan|dalous Pamphleteers, and other Ignorant Peo|ple, not a few.</P>
<P>The Di&s;&s;enter is an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> that being &s;omething de&s;irous of going to Heaven, ha|ving heard his Church of <HI>England</HI> Father, and School-ma&s;ter, and the Mini&s;ter of the Pari&s;h, talk much of it, begins &s;eriou&s;ly to enquire about the Way thither, and to that Purpo&s;e con&s;ulting his Bible and his Con&s;ci|ence, he finds that in his Opinion there are &s;ome Things in the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Way of Wor|&s;hip, which do not &s;eem to corre&s;pond with the Rule he has found out in the Scripture.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10">
Now I &s;hall not examine here whether the Man thus &s;crupulous be in the Right, or whether the Church be in the Right, it does not at all belong to the Ca&s;e in Hand.</P>
<P>But the Man being fully convinc'd that he ought to wor&s;hip God in that Way, exclu&s;ive of all others, which is mo&s;t agreeable to the Will of God reveal'd in the Scripture; and being on mature Con&s;ideration al&s;o, and after &s;incere Endeavours to be otherwi&s;e &s;atisfied, fully convinc'd that this E&s;tabli&s;h'd Way is not &s;o near to that Rule as it ought to be, ven|tures the Di&s;plea&s;ure of the Civil Magi&s;trate in di&s;&s;enting, in pure Obedience to the Com|mands of his Con&s;cience, and of that Rule which bids him obey God rather than Man; firmly believing that 'tis his Duty &s;o to do; and that the Compa&s;s and Extent of Humane Laws do not reach to bind him in Matters of Con&s;cience; at the &s;ame time living in Cha|rity with all the re&s;t of the World who&s;e Con&s;ciences do not require the &s;ame Re&s;tri|ction, and peaceably &s;ubmitting to the Laws and Government he lives under, as far as ei|ther his Right, as an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> or his Duty, as a Chri&s;tian, can require.</P>
<P>This is the Engli&s;h Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enter which I have been &s;peaking of, and concern|ing whom I have ventur'd to &s;ay, &s;o many Men, <HI>&s;o much wi&s;er than I,</HI> are Mi&s;taken.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">
If there are crept into his Company State Di&s;&s;enters, Politick Di&s;&s;enters, or any that give no Rea&s;on or other, or le&s;s Rea&s;ons, for their Di&s;&s;enting than the&s;e, they are not of them, and we wi&s;h they would go out from them.</P>
<P>I &s;ee no Act of Parliament a making to the Prejudice of this Di&s;&s;enter; and let Hot Men Preach, Print, and Say, what they plea&s;e, it is impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hou'd ever enter into the Brea&s;t of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prote&s;tant Parliament, or an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prote&s;tant Queen, either to Op|pre&s;s or Suppre&s;s &s;uch a Di&s;&s;enter.</P>
<P>'Tis for the Protection of this Hone&s;t, Well-meaning, Di&s;&s;enter, that in the late Reign the King and Parliament finding their Number Great, thought it was meet for the Quiet of the Nation, and as an Acknowledge|ment of the Superiority of Con&s;cience to all Humane Laws, to Settle their Liberty in an Act of Parliament; the &s;ame undi&s;puted Au|thority on which all our Civil, as well as Religious, Rights are E&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>This is the Di&s;&s;enter to which Her Maje|&s;ty has promi&s;ed Her Protection, and this Act of Parliament is the Toleration to Ten|der Con&s;ciences, for which Her Maje&s;ty open|ly declar'd Her Self, even to the Hazard of Her Royal Per&s;on.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Di&s;&s;enters who never gave Her Maje&s;ty any Rea&s;on to believe they did not Merit Her Protection, and I firmly believe never will.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12">
From the&s;e the Church of <HI>England</HI> has no|thing to fear, unle&s;s their Exemplary Lives, and Unque&s;tion'd Piety, &s;hou'd prevail to weaken Her Numbers, and we heartily wi&s;h all the Strife were reduc'd to this, <HI>viz.</HI> who &s;hou'd Live be&s;t, and who &s;hou'd Preach be&s;t.</P>
<P>If there are among them Vicious Youths, or Grown Hypocrites; if there are crept in Errors, Here&s;ies and Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, are not the &s;ame among the Church? If there are among the&s;e Di&s;&s;enters, Quakers, Antinomians, Sweet Singers, Muggletonians, and the like; the Church has al&s;o Her Socinians, Dei&s;ts, Anti - Trinitarians, Scepticks, A&s;gilites, and the like; there can be no Advantage pleaded again&s;t Here&s;ie, and Damnable He|terodox Opinions, from one Side more than another.</P>
<P>If we regard the Matters of State, the Di&s;&s;enters, and the Church of <HI>England,</HI> have &s;mall Advantage of the Argument one a|gain&s;t another; and I may without Arro|gance Challenge the Hot Church-Men, who can treat them with nothing but the Odious Name of Di&s;turbers of the Peace, Enemies of Monarchy, and Authors of Confu&s;ion, to bring the Loyalty of the Church of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> &s;o much boa&s;ted of in the World, to the Te&s;t, with the Loyalty of the Di&s;&s;enter; and as it has lately been done to my Hand, it is
<PB N="14" REF="13">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">New Te&s;t of the Church of <HI>England</HI>'s Loy|alty, <HI>P.</HI></NOTE> ea&s;ie to prove, that the Di&s;&s;enter has been equally Loyal to Prin|ces, equally True to the Govern|ment and Con&s;titution of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> as the Church; and the Church has been equally Di&s;loyal, and has as often Re|&s;i&s;ted, and took Arms again&s;t, the Lawful E&s;tabli&s;h'd Power and Prince, as the Di&s;&s;en|ter; and let them enter into this Di&s;pute whenever they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>But what is all this to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e? What we do as Engli&s;hmen is one thing, and what we do as Chri&s;tians, and Di&s;&s;enters, is another.</P>
<P>'Tis al&s;o foreign to our Purpo&s;e to Exa|mine or Reply to Dr. <HI>Stubbs,</HI> or the Multitude of Pamphleteers, who place them&s;elves at the forelorn Hope of the Church, and begin the War in hopes of drawing on that whole Body to an Engagement; when they can make it out, that the Di&s;&s;enter and the Church are as far a&s;under in Religion as God and <HI>Baal,</HI> I may po&s;&s;ibly think they Merit what they &s;o much Covet, <HI>viz.</HI> to be Reply'd to.</P>
<P>Whole Reams of Paper are &s;poil'd &s;ince that to prove that this Act of Parliament is needful, becau&s;e 'tis fit the Church &s;hould be E&s;tabli&s;h'd; to which I An&s;wer with a Que&s;tion ask'd once with much le&s;s Rea&s;on in another Ca&s;e, <HI>What need all this Wa&s;te?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14">
Gentlemen, E&s;tabli&s;h your Church with all the Precaution you can, Build a Fence of Impregnable Laws about it, you are wel|come; we never did, nor we do not now, Di&s;turb you; leave but us, your Poor Bre|thren, Liberty to &s;erve God according to our Con&s;ciences; don't bind us to do as you can do, whether we can or no; take your Places, and Pen&s;ions, and Profits, and de&s;erve them of the Nation, if you can; we ask nothing but our Rights, and what is now become &s;o by Law; if you claim the Civil Power as your own, you con&s;equently take us into your Protection; and let us &s;ee how Generous you'll be.</P>
<P>As to tho&s;e among us who can Conform to your Church for a Place, for a Salary, you are al&s;o welcome to take them among you, and let them be a part of your &s;elves; all the Converts you can make by the Mammon of Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s are your own; all you can Buy off, or Bribe off, or Fright off, <HI>let 'em go;</HI> we readily Grant, that whoever among us can, with Satisfaction to his Con&s;cience, Conform, ought to Conform; and we hear|tily Wi&s;h you would make &s;ome &s;mall Steps by way of Conde&s;cention to your Brethren, &s;uch as might open a Door for us all to Con|form to you, and then you &s;hou'd &s;ee whe|ther we Di&s;&s;ent from Principles of Ob&s;tinacy and Ill Nature, or from a meer Nece&s;&s;ity of
<PB N="16" REF="15">
Con&s;cience; you &s;hould then &s;ee whether the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England</HI> were Schi&s;maticks by Nature, and Heterodox by Inclination; or whether their Objections are grounded upon Scripture, and their Di&s;&s;enting from you an Act of an Inlightned Con&s;cience; you wou'd then try the Spirits whether they be of God.</P>
<P>But &s;ince you are of the Opinion that you are Capable of no Amendment, that you can|not Reform farther, and therefore will not Conde&s;cend one Step, though 'twould bring over Half a Million of Souls to you, <HI>an Emi|nent In&s;tance of the Charity of your Church,</HI> all we have to &s;ay in the Ca&s;e is, let us have the Protection of the Government, and the Li|berty the Laws allow us, and we are Content.</P>
<P>Upon this Score 'tis that we &s;ay the Act again&s;t Occa&s;ional Conformity does not con|cern us; they who can Conform for One Rea&s;on, may conform without Two, and ought to Conform; and we are therefore content to be di&s;tingui&s;h'd who cannot Con|form at all; and if we might offer &s;o boldly to you, who have any Intere&s;t in the <HI>Hou&s;e of Commons,</HI> we would humbly propo&s;e to have the Title of the Act alter'd, and to have it Entituled, <HI>An Act for the better &V;niting the Prote|&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters, by preventing Occa&s;ional Conformi|ty to the Church of</HI> England; and when that is done, let it pa&s;s with all our Hearts;
<PB N="17" REF="16">
and tho' we can ea&s;ily &s;ee what the De&s;ign is, <HI>viz.</HI> That no Di&s;&s;enter &s;hall be employ'd in Place of Tru&s;t or Profit in the Government, yet &s;ince it mu&s;t be &s;o, <HI>We hope, Gentlemen, you will be content to take all the Mi&s;carriages of the Govern|ment on you too;</HI> we &s;hall acquie&s;ce, let us alone in our Religion, let us Wor&s;hip God as we believe he has directed us, and all the re&s;t is your own.</P>
<P>But before we part let us have leave to remind you, that although we are willing to quit all our Civil Right to the Honours, as well as the Advantages, of &s;erving our Country, when we are cho&s;en to it by a Fair Majority, rather than not enjoy our Religion, and the Profe&s;&s;ion we make, with Peace and Liberty, yet it is no le&s;s an Op|pre&s;&s;ion upon us, and the Hard&s;hips are &s;uch as can never be defended by Rea&s;on or Equity.</P>
<P>We would be glad we had no Cau&s;e to think our &s;elves Injur'd; and to &s;uch of the Church of <HI>England</HI> who can judge without Prejudice, we would Appeal whether it is not very Hard,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That the Di&s;&s;enter &s;hall be excluded from all Places of Profit, Tru&s;t and Honour, and at the &s;ame time &s;hall not be excu&s;ed from tho&s;e which are attended with Charge, Trouble, and Lo&s;s of his Time?</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="17">
<HI>Secondly,</HI> That a Di&s;&s;enter &s;hall be Pre&s;s'd as a Sailor to Fight at Sea, Li&s;ted as a Sol|dier to Fight on Shore, and let his Merit be never &s;o much above his Fellows, &s;hall never be capable of Preferment; no, not a Lieutenant at Sea, or &s;o much as a Halbert in the Army.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That we mu&s;t maintain our own Clergy, and your Clergy; our own Poor, and your Poor; pay equal Taxes, and equal Duties; and yet not be thought worthy to be Tru&s;ted to &s;et a Drunkard in the Stocks.</P>
<P>We wonder, Gentlemen, you will accept our Money on your Deficient Funds, our Stocks to help carry on your Wars, our Loans and Credits to your Victualing Office, and Navy Office.</P>
<P>If you would go on to di&s;tingui&s;h us, get a Law made we &s;hall Buy no Lands, that we may not be Freeholders; and &s;ee if you could find Money to Buy us out.</P>
<P>Tran&s;plant us into Towns and Bodies, and let us Trade by our &s;elves; let us Card, Spin, Knit, Weave, and Work, with and for one another, and &s;ee how you'll main|tain your own Poor without us.</P>
<P>Let us Fraight our Ships apart, keep our Money out of your Bank, accept none of our Bills, and &s;eparate your &s;elves as ab&s;olutely from us in Civil Matters, as we do from
<PB N="19" REF="18">
you in Religious, and &s;ee how you can go on without us.</P>
<P>If you are not willing to do this, but we mu&s;t live among, you, Trade, Work, Re|ceive and Pay, together, why may we not do it in Peace, with Love and Unity, without daily Reproach? If we have any Knaves among us, take them; if we have any Hypocrites, any who can Conform, and do not, we are free to part with them, that the Remainder may be all &s;uch as agree with the Character here given; and when you have Garbl'd us to your Hearts de&s;ire, and ours, you need never fear your Church, as to her Politick Intere&s;t in the World; pray then let us be quiet.</P>
<P>What have we to do with your Di&s;tincti|ons of Whig and Tory? No farther that I know of than this, that when, di&s;tinct from our Religious Concerns, we come to talk of our Liberties, Properties, and Engli&s;h Priviledges, we are not for having them de|&s;troy'd by Ab&s;olute Authority, Di&s;pen&s;ing Power, and the like; and if this be to be Whigs, we are all Whigs.</P>
<P>As to Kings and Rulers, we are of the Opinion, that when they Degenerate into Tyrants, Oppre&s;s their People, De&s;troy the Laws, with all the <HI>Et-caetera</HI>'s of Arbitrary Power, 'tis Lawful for the Injur'd People to
<PB N="20" REF="19">
Reduce them to Rea&s;on, and to &s;eek Prote|ction, and Powerful Help, from any Body, to A&s;&s;i&s;t them to Recover their Undoubted Rights and Liberties; if this be to be Trai|tors, why then, Gentlemen of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> hold up your Hands; how &s;ay you? Are you Guilty, or not Guilty?</P>
<P>As to Oaths, <HI>with which, Gentlemen, ye were the Men that loaded your Allegiance farther than you had any Occa&s;ion,</HI> we are of the Opinion, that they can bind the Subject no longer than the Soveraign continues the Protection of the Executive Power; and that the late King by his De&s;erting the Throne, Ab&s;olv'd all his Subjects from the Bond of their Alle|giance; and on this Foot we made no Scruple to Swear to the Government, as it now &s;tands on the Foot of the late Revolution; and if you have Sworn with us, and yet do not believe &s;o, you may get off of the Per|jury if you can.</P>
<P>And what need is there now of running down the Di&s;&s;enters with a full Cry, as if this Act a coming out was a Machine to blow them all up; we &s;ee no Harm in it at all, other than the Hard&s;hips we mention'd before, mo&s;t of which we &s;uffer'd before, and are like only to have them the fa&s;ter en|tail'd on our Po&s;terity.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20">
All tho&s;e Gentlemen therefore who think this Act will weaken the Di&s;&s;enters, or wi&s;h it would, are manife&s;tly Mi&s;taken; it may di&s;tingui&s;h them better, and I am per&s;waded will fortifie them in their Hone&s;t Profe&s;&s;i|on; 'twill teach them, that if they will hold fa&s;t the Truth, they mu&s;t learn to live like People under the Power of tho&s;e who hate them, and de&s;pightfully u&s;e them.</P>
<P>The Di&s;&s;enters too are &s;trangely Mi&s;taken in their Apprehen&s;ions of the Ill Con&s;equen|ces of this Act.</P>
<P>To &s;uch I wou'd &s;ay, I cannot imagine what they have to fear from it, or why they &s;hou'd be unea&s;ie with the Honour they are al&s;o rid of, the Encumbrance of being Mayors, Aldermen, Jurats, and Sheriffs of the Towns and Corporations; and let them but reflect what was the Gain that all the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England</HI> have made by Places and Pen&s;ions from the Government &s;ince the late Revo|lution, I am per&s;waded 'twill not all amount to the Sum that one Churchman will be found to have Cheated the Nation of.</P>
<P>The Church are willing to engro&s;s all the Knaves to them&s;elves, and let them do it, and welcome, tho' they get all the Money into the Bargain; if they would but come to a fair Ac|count with us now, and repay all the Di&s;&s;en|ters Money the Nation has been Cheated of by Church Knaves, I dare undertake the Di&s;|&s;enters
<PB N="22" REF="21">
&s;hall repay all that can be Charg'd on their Knaves out of the Ballance.</P>
<P>The Foundation of the Di&s;&s;enters Safety is lodg'd, by God's E&s;pecial Providence, in the Queen's Veracity; while Her Maje&s;ty e&s;teems Her Word Sacred, as She has a&s;&s;ur'd us She will, we have no Occa&s;ion to be concern'd at all.</P>
<P>The Safety of the Di&s;&s;enters con&s;i&s;t in their own Hone&s;ty and Integrity; while they do nothing to offend either Her Maje&s;ty, or the Laws, if it were po&s;&s;ible to have a Parlia|ment of Church Biggots, or of Pulpit <HI>Sacha|verells,</HI> there will be no Fear of their Liberty.</P>
<P>As to the pre&s;ent Act, I doubt not but they will live to &s;ee Cau&s;e to be thankful for the making it, when the Mi&s;carriages of all People in Publick Offices and Employments are &s;o eminently fix'd upon a Party, and &s;o openly and fairly taken off from them.</P>
<P>They are Mi&s;taken too in the Sence of the Pre&s;ent Parliament; and they may be a&s;&s;ur'd, had not their Enemies &s;een that an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prote&s;tant Parliament, as this is, is not to be prevail'd upon to Overthrow &s;o Sub&s;tantial a Part of the Nation's Liberty as is &s;etled in the Act of Toleration, they had not re&s;ted &s;o long, but before now had attempted it.</P>
<P>They have try'd it in the Pulpit, &s;catter'd it in Scandalous Pamphlets from the Pre&s;s,
<PB N="23" REF="22">
affirm'd that Toleration is De&s;tructive of the Church's, as well as the Nation's, Safety; they have endeavour'd, by Calumny and Reproach to blacken the Di&s;&s;enters with Crimes never Committed; and which they wou'd never own before, are at la&s;t come to repre&s;ent them as a formidable Party.</P>
<P>And yet all this cou'd never bring &s;o much as One Member of the Hou&s;e to be &s;o blind to his Country's Intere&s;t, as to make a Mo|tion again&s;t the Act of Toleration.</P>
<P>Being thus di&s;appointed, and willing to play at &s;mall Game rather than &s;tand out, they fly to the Sanctuary of this Bill, and feign them&s;elves gratify'd by it more than ever the Bill, or the Hou&s;e it &s;elf, intended; for in all their Arguments for the Bill, 'tis &s;up|pos'd to be a Means to Reduce, Humble, and Mortifie the Di&s;&s;enters; <HI>Ridiculus Mus!</HI> Is this all? Why really, Gentlemen, had it been in our Power, you &s;hould have had all this without an Act of Parliament; this will Strengthen, not Reduce, us; 'twill Plea&s;e, not Mortifie or Humble, us; and thus you find your &s;elves all Mi&s;taken; Mi&s;taken in the Hou&s;e of Commons them&s;elves, in think|ing the Repre&s;entatives of a Prote&s;tant Na|tion will Repeal the Act of Toleration, up|on which the Tranquility of their Native Country &s;o much depends; but above all,
<PB N="24" REF="23">
Mi&s;taken in their Expectation of the Queen, to whom their Behaviour is Prepo&s;terous and Unmannerly.</P>
<P>'Twas Prepo&s;terous for People to expect, that becau&s;e the Queen was a Friend to the Church, a con&s;tant Member, and always E&s;pou&s;ed the Intere&s;t of the Church, that therefore when She came to the Crown, She mu&s;t come up to all their Extravagant Heights.</P>
<P>When Her Maje&s;ty was Prince&s;s, and a Subject, &s;he con&s;tantly adher'd to the Intere&s;t of the Church; but at the &s;ame time declar'd Her Opinion for tolerating the Di&s;&s;enters in their Liberty of Prote&s;tant Wor&s;hip, while they behaved them&s;elves quietly and obedi|ently under the Government.</P>
<P>When Her Maje&s;ty came to the Crown, She became the general Mother, the Guar|dian, the Refuge of all Her Subjects; She places the Church fir&s;t in Her Favour, pro|mi&s;es them Her Special and Particular Care, as tho&s;e who by Judgment and Inclination She &s;tands engaged with; but as She finds a great Number of Her People unhappily di|vided in Opinion, yet in all other Re&s;pects Her good Subjects, what can She do le&s;s than give them Her Protection? This She has readily promis'd them, and on this they thankfully depend.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="24">
But here comes the Gentlemen of the Long Gown, and they tell Her in &s;o many Words, She cannot, She mu&s;t not, keep Her Word with us; they tell us She will halt between God and <HI>Baal,</HI> if She does not &s;o Declare for the Church, as to her Be&s;t to Suppre&s;s and De|&s;troy all Separate Wor&s;hips, and have all the Prie&s;ts of <HI>Baal,</HI> the be&s;t Terms they can be|&s;tow on the Di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ters, hew'd to Pieces before the Lord.</P>
<P>'Tis Unmannerly that the Church of <HI>England</HI>-men &s;hou'd expect the Queen to break Her Word with &s;ome of Her Subjects to oblige others; and that whereas She has promis'd them Her Special Favour, they &s;hou'd not be content with that, unle&s;s She will at the &s;ame time Oppre&s;s Two Milli|ons of her Faithful People to oblige them.</P>
<P>Let them go on, but let them be a&s;&s;ur'd the Di&s;&s;enters &s;hall enjoy their Liberty of Con|&s;cience, till they can prevail with Her Ma|je&s;ty to lay a&s;ide Her Veracity, and forget Her Royal Word, and refu&s;e us Her Protecti|on, which we are re&s;olved never to give Her any Rea&s;on for.</P>
<P>As to the Bill again&s;t Occa&s;ional Conformi|ty, it baulks their De&s;ign on the Di&s;&s;enters, for 'tis for their Advantage; they always di&s;|lik'd the Practice; it has more than once been Prote&s;ted again&s;t, and Exploded; and I dare
<PB N="26" REF="25">
undertake not one Di&s;&s;enter offers to pre|&s;ent a Petition to the Hou&s;e again&s;t its Pa&s;|&s;ing.</P>
<P>'Tis plain, that Occa&s;ional Communion is contrary to the very Nature and Being of a Di&s;&s;enter; who, if he can Conform, ought to Conform; and if he can for a Place of Pre|ferment, ought to do it without that Prefer|ment.</P>
<P>'Tis plain, that whatever, by the Conni|vance of Remi&s;s Mini&s;ters, and with too much Regard to Parties, may have been &s;lightly pa&s;s'd over, yet by the very Con|&s;titution and Foundation of a Collected, Se|parate, Church or Congregation, no Man can go back to the Communion of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and be receiv'd again upon any other Condition but as a Penitent; 'tis an Act De&s;tructive of all po&s;&s;ible Pretence for Di&s;&s;enting, and never was, nor never can, be defended by any Di&s;&s;enter, without over|throwing all the Rea&s;ons they cou'd ever give for Di&s;&s;enting.</P>
<P>How then can this Bill be aim'd at the Di&s;|&s;enters; either they who think 'tis aim'd at them, are Mi&s;taken; or they that point it at them, are Mi&s;taken; for Suppre&s;&s;ing an Error crept in among them, contrary to their Con|&s;titution, again&s;t their Judgment, declar'd by them to be a Grievance, can never be their Injury, nor ought not to be their Trouble.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="26">
Let them name us the Di&s;&s;enter that ever vindicated this Practice, one pa&s;&s;ionate Au|thor excepted; let them tell us the Time when any Congregation receiv'd &s;uch a Con|forming Nonconformi&s;t without Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">atisfa|ctions and Di&s;contents; let them tell us a Time whenever the thing was practic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d till the Reign of King <HI>James.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis a Novelty, an Abu&s;e crept in among us, and we are glad to have it condemn'd by Authority; at the &s;ame Time not at all thinking our &s;elves oblig'd to the Authors for their Good Will.</P>
<P>'Twill be objected, this is a Feint, to clo&s;e with a thing when you cannot help it.</P>
<P>No, Gentlemen, we don't tell you we like that part of the Bill, which Excludes us from the Native Honours and Preferments of our Country, which are our Due, our Birthright, equally with our Neighbours, and to which we &s;hould be call'd by the Suffrage of the Peo|ple; and we cannot but think it a Hard|&s;hip beyond the Power of Rea&s;on to ju&s;ti|fie; but &s;ince this Right mu&s;t be clogg'd with &s;o many Inconveniencies, that we mu&s;t Mortgage our Con&s;ciences to enjoy them, no Man can have any Charity left for us, but mu&s;t pre&s;ently conclude we &s;hall freely forego &s;uch Trifles for our Con|&s;ciences, or el&s;e that we have no Con&s;ciecnes at all&punc;</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="27">
Therefore <HI>'tis no Feint;</HI> we are &s;o content with the Suppre&s;&s;ing the Grievance of this Scandalous <HI>Ambo-dexter Conformity,</HI> that we think the Hard&s;hips put upon us with it not worth naming; we doubt not the Par|liament will one time or other &s;ee Cau&s;e to do us Ju&s;tice, and to re&s;tore to us the Privi|ledges of our Ance&s;tors, and which we have done nothing to forfeit.</P>
<P>But all the Parliaments that ever were, or will be, can never Suppre&s;s any thing a|mong us &s;o Scandalous to our Reputation, and to that Candour with which we de|&s;ire to Guide our Actions, nor &s;o Contrary to, and De&s;tructive of, the very Nature of our &s;eparating from the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and the Con&s;titution of all our Collected Congregations.</P>
<P>We acknowledge, that if this was an al|low'd Practice among us, we cou'd not pre|tend the Character of a Di&s;&s;enter I have here given to be Ju&s;t; but without Que&s;tion it is a mo&s;t Ju&s;t Character of all tho&s;e Di&s;&s;en|ters who are Con&s;ciencious and Hone&s;t; 'tis the Original, the Nature, of a Di&s;&s;enter; what is crept in more is a Corruption, and we wi&s;h it Extingui&s;hed; and &s;ince none has &s;aid any thing of this Nature but what has been &s;aid before, and no Church of <HI>England</HI>-Man can think or &s;peak wor&s;t of
<PB N="29" REF="28">
it than the truly Religious Di&s;&s;enters have done, we freely di&s;mi&s;s all tho&s;e who can thus Build with one Hand, and Pull Down with another, to a Liberty of declaring for the future who they are for.</P>
<P>Only pur&s;uant to what has all along been acknowledg'd, &s;o far as we have handl'd this Argument, if they wou'd accept of the Friendly Advice of their Brethren, it &s;hould be, that they would for the future Conform to the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>For 'tis plain, he that can Conform to the Church to qualifie him&s;elf for Prefer|ment, for Employment, or any other &s;uch Rea&s;on, can Conform; if not, he mu&s;t be arrived to a Degree of Ma&s;ter&s;hip over his Con&s;cience, &s;o as to &s;ubject it to his Inte|re&s;t, and act again&s;t Light; and he that can do that, may do any thing, and 'tis no Matter what Church he Communicates with; of &s;uch a Man I think I Tre&s;pa&s;s not up|on Charity to &s;ay, he has all his Work of Religion to do over again; and he al&s;o may Conform till God &s;hall give his Con&s;cience Light enough to chu&s;e by, and him Grace to be Obedient to the Convictions of his own Heart; and whether that be to Con|form or Di&s;&s;ent, let him judge for him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="29">
But if any Man who has Profe&s;t him&s;elf a Religious Di&s;&s;enter, &s;hall, upon the Pa&s;&s;ing this Act, declare him&s;elf Re&s;olv'd to return to the Di&s;&s;enters, I think no Congregation of Di&s;&s;enters, according to the Nature of Re|ligious Communion, can receive him upon any other Terms than as a Penitent.</P>
<P><HI>If he has not Sinn'd, why &s;hou'd he Repent?</HI> Says a Learned Author in this very Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, he either has Sinn'd in Con|forming, or he Sinn'd in Di&s;&s;enting before, or he Sins in coming off; for if he did not Sin in Conforming, he ought to have continued there, and his coming off is a plain Schi&s;m; but if he did Sin, he ought to acknowledge the Sin, which is what I mean by being re|ceiv'd as a Penitent.</P>
<P>I am told after all this, but upon what Authority do you write thus? You take upon you to write in the Name of the Di&s;|&s;enters, what Commi&s;&s;ion have you to write in the Plural? And how do we know that the Di&s;&s;enters di&s;own this Occa&s;ional Com|munion?</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, Publication is an Appeal to the World; if I have wrote what is not true, or affirm'd that in the Name of the Di&s;&s;en|ters which is not their Opinion, I am liable to an ea&s;ie Confutation; but as I have never yet had my Argument refuted, &s;o though
<PB N="31" REF="30">
I have not received a Formal Commi&s;&s;ion, Truth is a General Commi&s;&s;ion, and any Man may write it.</P>
<P>And yet I am not without a general Con|currence of all the Di&s;&s;enters I ever con|ver&s;t with; and he that can an&s;wer the Ar|gument is welcome to make his Negative as publick as this, and let the World judge who is in the Right.</P>
