<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following E&s;&s;ays, among many more of the &s;ame Nature, were writ|ten, as is hinted in the Title-Page, at the De&s;ire, and for the U&s;e, of a young Clergy|man; and tran&s;mitted to him in &s;o many Letters, on the following laudable Occa&s;ion. His Friends had procured him a confiderable Benefice in the Country, where he no &s;oon|er came to re&s;ide, than he was attacked by &s;everal of his Neighbours, mo&s;t of them Men of Wit and Figure, and profe&s;&s;ed Sceptics, about the above-mentioned, and other &s;crip|tural Subjects, of the like important Nature; in which he had the Misfortune to be &s;o lit|tle
<PB N="4" REF="3">
ver&s;ed, that he mu&s;t, in all Likelihood, have become the frequent Subject of their Raillery, and led a very unea&s;y Life among them, had not his good Sen&s;e, and &s;ingular Mo|de&s;ty, directed him to an Expedient, that would at lea&s;t intitle him to, if not procure him, better Quarter from them: And this was, by ingenuou&s;ly owning him&s;elf, as yet, too young, and unacquainted with the Topicks they urged again&s;t him, to enter the Li&s;ts with &s;uch &s;ea&s;oned Opponents; and begging of them, for Truth's &s;ake, that he might be allowed the Liberty of turning the&s;e Points in Di&s;pute over to a Per&s;on whom he knew to have been, of a long time, conver&s;ant with that kind of Learning; and who had lately publi&s;hed &s;ome occa&s;ional Remarks upon &s;un|dry Subjects of the like controverted Nature, which had been well received by the Public. So ju&s;t and mode&s;t a Propo&s;al could hardly fail of being complied with; and they came into it the more readily, it &s;eems, when he appri&s;ed them, that the Per&s;on he de&s;igned to apply to was an ob&s;cure Layman, who
<PB N="5" REF="4">
had &s;pent a great Part of his latter Years in Privacy and Retirement, and who, he had Rea&s;on to believe, was in no way addicted or bigotted to either Party or Opinion. They only expre&s;&s;ed a De&s;ire to know his Name, and &s;uch other Particulars as he &s;hould think fit to acquaint them with; both which he declined to do, without my Leave, le&s;t that &s;hould induce me to refu&s;e the Ta&s;k; as he was fully appri&s;ed of the Care I had taken to conceal my being the Author of tho&s;e Productions from all but a few &s;elect Friends. I failed not, in my next Letter, to thank him for his kind Caution; and to a&s;&s;ure him of my Unwillingne&s;s to comply with his Reque&s;t upon any other Terms: To which he inform|ed me, &s;oon after, they all readily acquie&s;ced: Immediately after which our epi&s;tolary Cor|re&s;pondence began; and each of the Subjects in Debate were regularly conveyed to me by him, with full Liberty of methodizing both the Objections and An&s;wers, in &s;uch manner as I thought would prove mo&s;t convincing
<PB N="6" REF="5">
and &s;atisfactory to them; or to the Public, in ca&s;e I &s;hould be inclined to make them &s;o.</P>
<P>This Licence proved the more acceptable to me, becau&s;e, though I had then no View of printing them, yet I found the mo&s;t &s;eri|ous of tho&s;e Subjects treated by his Antago|ni&s;ts in &s;o trivial and ludicrous a manner, as if they had been fitter for Ridicule, than an impartial Examination. So that I made no Difficulty to take them at their Word, and to retrench as much of the &s;arca&s;tical Plea&s;antry out of their Objections, as I found void of Rea&s;oning; as well as to &s;often the Profanene&s;s and Scurrility of their Language, where-ever it could be done without le&s;&s;en|ing the Weight and Strength of their Ob|jections. And thus much may &s;uffice for the Occa&s;ion of my writing the&s;e E&s;&s;ays.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t, however, acquaint the Reader, that the five above-mentioned Subjects were not the only controverted ones that were &s;ent to me from the &s;ame Quarter. Several others
<PB N="7" REF="6">
they &s;ucce&s;&s;ively communicated to me, no le&s;s curious and important: Some of which, I found, had been &s;o fully and learnedly treated, by a Set of Gentlemen, in a late ex|ten&s;ive Work, that I made no Scruple to re|fer our Antagoni&s;ts to it, for a &s;atisfactory An&s;wer to all their Objections<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Un. Hi&s;t.</HI> 8<HI>vo. vol.</HI> iii. <HI>p.</HI> 390, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI> 496, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI></NOTE>. Of this Nature were tho&s;e two miraculous Tran&s;|actions, mentioned in the Old Te&s;tament; <HI>viz.</HI> the Pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> through the <HI>Red Sea (Exod.</HI> xiv.); and the &s;upernatural Sol&s;tice obtained by <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> their new Chief, in the Land of <HI>Canaan (Jo&s;h.</HI> x.): To which I may add a third, which gave me no le&s;s Plea&s;ure to find &s;o ju&s;tly and evidently clear|ed by tho&s;e curious Gentlemen, and in a manner entirely new; <HI>viz.</HI> the different Ge|nealogies given of Chri&s;t, in the Go&s;pels of St. <HI>Matthew</HI> and St. <HI>Luke</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid. vol.</HI> x. <HI>p.</HI> 451, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI> (R).</NOTE>; a Point that hath lately exerci&s;ed &s;ome of our be&s;t Heads. And this I the more readily did, in
<PB N="8" REF="7">
hopes that if I could, by that means, bring my polemic Corre&s;pondents to be better ac|quainted with that exten&s;ive Work, they would find &s;o many Difficulties of the like Nature &s;o &s;atisfactorily cleared, as would, of cour&s;e, much le&s;&s;en the Matter of this our epi&s;tolary Controver&s;y, as well as induce them to treat the&s;e &s;erious and important Subjects in a le&s;s ludicrous and offen&s;ive manner.</P>
<P>As for the Occa&s;ion of my now publi&s;h|ing the five following ones, I &s;hall not in|&s;i&s;t here on the kind Invitations I had to it, from &s;ome of my worthy Country Friends, who had both peru&s;ed them, and been Wit|ne&s;&s;es of the good Effect they had on &s;ome of my young Clergyman's Antagoni&s;ts; for if that had had a &s;ufficient Weight with me, they had appeared in Print &s;ome Years ago. Neither could the various Attempts that have been made, from time to time, by &s;o many eminent Hands, again&s;t the Authority of the &s;acred Books, have induced me to it &s;ince
<PB N="9" REF="8">
then; becau&s;e I could &s;ee neither Objection nor Argument in any of them, if we except, perhaps, the Newne&s;s and Variety of their Dre&s;s, but had been fully exploded over and over, by Per&s;ons of equal Sen&s;e and Learn|ing, and much &s;uperior to them, in the learn|ed World's Eye, in point of Judgment, and fair &s;olid Rea&s;oning; and (what could not but le&s;&s;en one's Value of them) without paying any Regard to, or taking the lea&s;t No|tice of, what had been &s;o often, and &s;o powerfully, urged on the other Side of the Que&s;tion. This Treatment appears &s;till the more unfair, as they have not hitherto made any fre&s;h Attack on their Side, but hath been &s;oon after fairly examined and confuted on ours; and, I may add, in a more civil, &s;e|rious, candid, and impartial Way, than we have, as yet, met from them, though they &s;o frequently charge us with the contrary Be|haviour; but how ju&s;tly, let every Reader judge, from all that hath been written on either Side. I was therefore &s;o well &s;atisfied, upon the Whole, that the Foundation of
<PB N="10" REF="9">
the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and Chri&s;tian Revelation, as well as the Evidence of the Miracles upon which both are built, were out of all Danger of being &s;haken by any Attempt that had hi|therto been made, or, as I imagined, could be made, again&s;t it from that Quarter, that I could not &s;uppo&s;e this occa&s;ional Perform|ance of mine could add any Weight to that Variety of &s;olid Arguments, and Cloud of unque&s;tionable Te&s;timonies, that had been urged in its Defence. I was rather in hopes, that after the Divine Authority both of the Law and Go&s;pel had been &s;o clearly and learnedly demon&s;trated, all the other Diffi|culties and Cavils which have been rai&s;ed again&s;t them, would ea&s;ily have yielded to that &s;uperior Evidence, and have &s;ub&s;ided of their own Accord; in&s;tead of furni&s;hing our &s;ceptic Opponents with fre&s;h Occa&s;ion of di&s;crediting and ridiculing the &s;acred Records, by magnifying and mi&s;repre&s;enting tho&s;e Dif|ficulties at the unfair Rate they have lately done, and as if they were of them&s;elves &s;uf|ficient to invalidate their divine Authority,
<PB N="11" REF="10">
and the Credibility of the great and mani|fold Miracles upon which it is founded<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>See the Author of the Characteri&s;tics, Collins, Tin|dal, Chub, &amp;c.</HI></NOTE>. But as tho&s;e further Exceptions could never be deemed, by the &s;erious Part of Mankind, &s;ufficient to outweigh &s;o great an Evidence, a new Expedient mu&s;t be thought on, that might at once overturn both the Foundation and Super&s;tructure; and that was, by trying to de&s;troy, not only the Probability, but even the Po&s;&s;ibility, of all Miracles. To this End, among other Champions, one of them, a pro|&s;e&s;&s;ed Infidel, boldly enters the Li&s;ts, under the Di&s;gui&s;e of a <HI>Moral Philo&s;opher;</HI> and not only attacks the greate&s;t and be&s;t atte&s;ted Miracle of the Go&s;pel, again&s;t the learned Author of the Trial of the Witne&s;&s;es<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><HI>Re&s;urrection con&s;idered, p.</HI> 89, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI></NOTE>; but, on the Strength of an imaginary Victo|ry, concludes that indige&s;ted Performance with what he &s;tiles a full and unan&s;werable Confutation of the Reality and Po&s;&s;ibility of any of the re&s;t: His &s;welling Stile induces
<PB N="12" REF="11">
one to believe, that he comes fraught with &s;ome new-&s;et Arguments, that will give a deci&s;ive Blow to the Controver&s;y between us; whil&s;t, in Fact, he produces none but &s;uch trite and exploded ones, as give Rea&s;on to expect, that &s;omething more effectual is &s;till behind, and kept in re&s;erve for the concluding Blow; without which one would hardly have the Patience to follow him through &s;o much Scurrility, Arrogance, and Impiety; and you are not appri&s;ed of your Mi&s;take, till you are in&s;en&s;ibly brought to the End of the Book.</P>
<P>This Piece, however, which had &s;o little Novelty to recommend it, except the Bold|ne&s;s and Inveteracy of its Stile, gave our Country Antagoni&s;ts &s;uch new Matter for Triumph, that my young Clergyman was forced to call upon me for fre&s;h A&s;&s;i&s;tance; every Argument in it appearing to them both new and deci&s;ive, &s;o little were they ver&s;ed in that trite Controver&s;y: And I &s;hould have had the irk&s;ome Ta&s;k of confuting them, had
<PB N="13" REF="12">
not I been timely relieved by a much abler Hand, which appeared &s;oon after, in the De|fence of the <HI>Trial of the Witne&s;&s;es;</HI> and, in a few Pages at the End of it, exploded all his pretended Rea&s;oning again&s;t the Po&s;&s;ibility of Miracles, in &s;o clear, nervous, and convincing a manner<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><HI>Evidence of the Re&s;urrection cleared, p.</HI> 143, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI></NOTE>, as, I doubted not, would, up|on the bare Reading, effectually &s;atisfy them, and excu&s;e my proceeding farther upon that Head, as well as from publi&s;hing any of the other Subjects of our epi&s;tolary Controver&s;y; unle&s;s &s;ome future, and more proper, Occa|&s;ion &s;hould induce me to it. But this, I ima|gined, would not be in Ha&s;te, con&s;idering the &s;ignal Defeat which that daring Cham|pion had met with, after having &s;pent &s;o long a time in raking up all the Objections, and &s;ophi&s;tical Rea&s;oning, of his whole un|believing Tribe, again&s;t the Po&s;&s;ibility of all Miracles, and in dre&s;&s;ing them up in the mo&s;t a&s;&s;uming and invidious Terms; for this bold Piece did not appear in Print, till the incom|parable
<PB N="14" REF="13">
one he pretended to an&s;wer had gone through a tenth Edition: And it was, in all Likelihood, the Succe&s;s, and univer&s;al Appro|bation, this la&s;t &s;o ju&s;tly met with, that cau&s;ed &s;uch an extraordinary Profu&s;ion of Gall in our pretended Moral Philo&s;opher, beyond what is u&s;ually met with in the Writings of his Brethren: So that it was now high time for them to look out for &s;ome &s;kilful Hand, to wipe off, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the Di&s;|credit which that frantic Performance had done to them, and their Cau&s;e; by re&s;uming its Defence, if not by a new Recruit of more &s;olid Arguments (their Logic and Phi|lo&s;ophy having been long exhau&s;ted), by dre&s;&s;ing the old exploded ones in &s;uch a po|lite and artful Trim, as might carry, at lea&s;t, the Appearance of Novelty; and there|by the more ea&s;ily in&s;inuate them into the Minds of the Thoughtle&s;s and Unwary, with|out giving &s;uch great Offence to tho&s;e of the oppo&s;ite Side.</P>
<P>And here I cannot pretend to &s;ay how ma|ny Hands engaged in this new Attempt. I
<PB N="15" REF="14">
rather wonder, that any &s;hould, where &s;o little Thanks and Credit were to be gained; and where the only plau&s;ible Pretext for &s;o do|ing, <HI>viz.</HI> the promoting of natural Religion, or moral Virtue, and the Happine&s;s of Society, had been &s;o fairly exploded; and their Write|ings proved, by &s;o many able Pens, to tend to undermine and ruin them both: In&s;o|much that one of the polite&s;t of them, and a &s;trenuous Oppo&s;er of revealed Religion, makes no Difficulty to own its &s;uperior In|fluence on the Lives and Conduct of Man|kind, to all the other Topicks which he had put into the Mouth of his <HI>Epicurean</HI> Philo|&s;opher; and to conclude his Argument with this notable Remark; which, whether meant in Earne&s;t or no, mu&s;t needs carry its own Evidence with it, in the Judgment of every &s;trict Ob&s;erver of Mankind: His Words are the&s;e<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hume's E&s;&s;ay on particular Providence, and future State, p.</HI> 231.</NOTE>: <HI>Whether this Rea&s;oning of theirs</HI> (about the Rewards and Puni&s;hments of a future State) <HI>be ju&s;t or not, is no Matter.</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="15">
<HI>Its Influence on their Life and Conduct mu&s;t &s;till be the &s;ame. And tho&s;e who attempt to di&s;abu&s;e them, may, for ought I know, be good Rea&s;oners; but I cannot allow them to be good Citizens and Politicians: Since they free Men from one Re&s;traint upon their Pa&s;&s;ions, and make the Infringement of the Laws of Equity and Society, in one re&s;pect, more ea&s;y and &s;ecure.</HI></P>
<P>Now, if the Notion of future Rewards and Puni&s;hments, founded on a mere ab&s;|tru&s;e Rea&s;oning, be allowed to be of any Efficacy towards the Pre&s;ervation of the Peace and Intere&s;t of Society; how much greater Influence mu&s;t it be &s;uppo&s;ed to have on the Minds and Actions of Men, when once &s;irmly believed to be founded on the Authority of a Divine Revelation; and &s;uch a Revelation, as is &s;o exactly calculated to promote the mo&s;t &s;ocial and exalted Vir|tues, and to enforce them, by the noble&s;t and mo&s;t powerful Motives? In&s;omuch that, were it not built on &s;o &s;trong a Foundation, it
<PB N="17" REF="16">
would be hardly po&s;&s;ible for a &s;incere Well-wi&s;her to human Society, not to wi&s;h it were &s;o. And may we not here &s;afely pro|nounce that Author to be a much wor&s;e Politician and Commonwealth's-man, who hath taken &s;uch extraordinary Pains to over-turn, burle&s;que, and ridicule it, if not with &s;uch &s;currilous and inveterate Malice as his Predece&s;&s;or had done, yet with &s;uch &s;ubtle and &s;ophi&s;tical Rea&s;oning, and dogmatic Ar|rogance, as if the Peace and Welfare of Man|kind depended wholly on its Ruin<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><HI>See his E&s;&s;ay on Miracles, pa&s;&s;.</HI></NOTE>? If the former therefore hath been &s;o ju&s;tly cen|&s;ured for his &s;plenetic and bla&s;phemous Lan|guage, even by tho&s;e who are no Enemies, in other re&s;pects, to his Way of Thinking; &s;ome decent Regard being certainly due to that Authority, from which we derive the Liberty we enjoy, of free &s;peaking and write|ing; what mu&s;t a &s;ober Reader think of the latter, who, without producing one new Ar|gument again&s;t the Reality and Evidence of tho&s;e Miracles, upon which it is founded, or
<PB N="18" REF="17">
taking the lea&s;t Notice, how clearly and fully all his old ones again&s;t it had been exploded, by &s;o many Per&s;ons of Learning and Merit, makes no Scruple to pronounce them mere Delu&s;ions, Forgery, and Impo&s;itions upon Mankind, merely on account of their being Miracles? So that, according to him, every Man of Sen&s;e may, and ought to reject them, without farther Trial or Regard, either to the Authority they claim, or any Evidence or Te|&s;timony, how great &s;oever, that is urged in De|fence of them<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Hume's E&s;&s;ay on Miracles, p.</HI> 179, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI></NOTE>. How much behind his Bro|ther he comes, in his bitter, as well as unju&s;t, Reflections again&s;t the Chri&s;tian Revelation, may be judged, among many other In&s;tances, by this one Scantling, with which he concludes his E&s;&s;ay: Where having told his Reader, but a Page or two before, <HI>that our mo&s;t holy Religion</HI> (&s;o he is plea&s;ed to &s;tile it, in an ironical Sneer) <HI>is founded on Faith, and not on Rea&s;on; and that it is the &s;ure&s;t Way to expo&s;e it, to put it to &s;uch a Trial, as it is by no means fit to endure</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid. p.</HI> 205.</NOTE>; he clo&s;es up

the Whole with the&s;e remarkable Words<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Hume's E&s;&s;ay on Miracles, p.</HI> 207.</NOTE>: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"So that, upon the Whole, we may conclude, that the Chri&s;tian Religion was at fir&s;t not only attended with Miracles, but even at this Day cannot be believed, by any rea|&s;onable Per&s;on, without one. Mere Rea|&s;on is in&s;ufficient to convince us of its Ve|racity; and whoever is moved by Faith to a&s;&s;ent to it, is con&s;cious of a Miracle in his own Per&s;on; which &s;ubverts all the Principles of his Under&s;tanding, and gives him a Determination to believe, what is mo&s;t contrary to Cu&s;tom and Experience."</Q> I am willing to hope, however, that the &s;incere Profe&s;&s;ors of that holy Religion will be able to draw a much ju&s;ter Conclu&s;ion from his Premi&s;es; and that the Sight of &s;o much Learning, Philo&s;ophy, and &s;ubtle Rea&s;oning, di&s;play'd in Defence of &s;o bad a Cau&s;e, will direct them to di&s;cover the real Miracle, where this Author lea&s;t expects it; whil&s;t it reminds them of the many &s;ignal In&s;tances in which the Divine Providence hath, ac|cording

<P>What I would farther ob&s;erve, with re|&s;pect to this notable Conclu&s;ion, is his &s;hrewd Manner of introducing it, two or three Pages before, in the&s;e Terms: <HI>I am the better plea&s;ed with this Method of Rea&s;oning, as I think it may &s;erve to confound tho&s;e dangerous Friends, or di&s;gui&s;ed Enemies, to the Chri&s;tian Reli|gion, who have undertaken to defend it by the Principles of human Rea&s;on</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hume's E&s;&s;ay on Mirales, p.</HI> 204, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI></NOTE>.

by gradual Steps, to its full Comple|tion, by our Divine Redeemer, under the Light of his glorious Go&s;pel. For if it can be once fairly proved, again&s;t all our Op|po&s;ers, to be every way con&s;i&s;tent with the Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s of the Supreme Be|ing, to interpo&s;e his divine Power, in order to rectify the enormous Di&s;orders that had been introduced into the moral World, par|ticularly in Religion; then it will be no le&s;s evident, that no Period could be more &s;ea&s;onable, to lay the Foundation of &s;uch a Reformation, than this; when the civil Power, and the Avarice of the heathen Prie&s;ts, had rendered the Di&s;temper incurable by any other means, than by &s;uch a Series of Wonders: No Scene more proper to di&s;play them in than <HI>Egypt;</HI> where the mo&s;t abo|minable Idolatry and Wor&s;hip had its Birth, and had &s;pread it&s;elf into all other Countries, far and near. Neither will any of the Mi|racles, which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> wrought there, under the Divine Power and Direction, appear le&s;s wi&s;ely levelled again&s;t &s;ome one or other of
<PB N="28" REF="27">
their pretended Deities, or again&s;t &s;ome other Branch of their idolatrous Theology; and con&s;equently every way conducive to the main De&s;ign of convincing that infatuated People, by the mo&s;t rational means, of God's ab&s;olute Superintendency and Government over the whole Creation.</P>
<P>The extraordinary Adventure of <HI>Balaam,</HI> and the &s;ingular Circum&s;tances that accom|panied it, have been likewi&s;e the Subject of much Cavil and Ridicule among our Unbe|lievers, and of Doubt and Di&s;&s;atisfaction among the far greater Part of Believers, both <HI>Jews</HI> and Chri&s;tians; either for want of Lei|&s;ure, or Capacity, to give it a due and &s;erious Examination; many of them, even among the latter, looking upon the whole Tran&s;|action as &s;carce worth, or fit to bear, a Scru|tiny. Yet I am willing to hope, that what I have &s;aid upon it will ea&s;ily reconcile any impartial Reader to the mo&s;t exceptionable Part of it, and make the Whole to appear al|together uniform, agreeable, and conducing
<PB N="29" REF="28">
to the &s;ame gracious Sy&s;tem of the Divine Providence. But of all the Tran&s;actions re|corded in the Old Te&s;tament, none have been objected &s;o much again&s;t, or with &s;o great Appearance of Rea&s;on, as tho&s;e &s;ur|pri&s;ing &s;wift Marches, and &s;ignal Victories, a&s;cribed to <HI>Jo&s;hua, Saul,</HI> and other <HI>Hebrew</HI> Chiefs; and which, con&s;idering the plain and &s;uccinct Stile in which they are related by the &s;acred Penmen, are clogged with &s;o many geographical and other Difficulties, as have appeared, to &s;ome of the able&s;t Com|mentators, altogether in&s;urmountable. I have, in the following E&s;&s;ays, &s;ingled out two of the mo&s;t remarkable In&s;tances of that Kind; <HI>viz.</HI> that of <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> over <HI>Jabin,</HI> King of <HI>Hazor,</HI> and his numberle&s;s Confederates; and the &s;wift Conque&s;t of Northern <HI>Canaan,</HI> that immediately followed it<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> xi. <HI>pa&s;&s;.</HI></NOTE>; and that of <HI>Saul</HI> over <HI>Naha&s;h,</HI> King of the <HI>Ammonites,</HI> at the Siege of <HI>Jabe&s;h-Gilead</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xi. <HI>pa&s;&s;.</HI></NOTE>. This la&s;t, above all others, is related with &s;o many Cir|cum&s;tances
<PB N="30" REF="29">
which give it the Appearance of Impo&s;&s;ibility, that mo&s;t Critics and Com|mentators have been contented to let the Cre|dibility of it re&s;t on the &s;ole Authority of the in&s;pired Writer. And yet I dare flatter my|&s;elf to have made it plainly appear, in the la&s;t of the&s;e E&s;&s;ays, that there wanted nothing but a competent Acquaintance with the ex|cellent Laws, and martial Di&s;cipline, of the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> together with &s;ome Attention to the Geography of their Country, and the Si|tuation of their re&s;pective Tribes, both with regard to each other, and to the heathen Nations round about them, to di&s;pel all tho&s;e &s;eemingly un&s;urmountable Difficulties, and to demon&s;trate that whole Tran&s;action to be every way as fea&s;ible and probable (though, in mo&s;t re&s;pects, as great and noble, if not much more &s;o), as any that is to be met with in &s;acred or profane Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>This la&s;t Piece, it is hoped, the Reader will not be di&s;plea&s;ed to &s;ee publi&s;hed in a different Form from the re&s;t (<HI>viz.</HI> in that of a

Sermon, in which it was originally written by the &s;ame Lay Hand); when he comes to be acquainted, at the Conclu&s;ion, with the Oc|ca&s;ion and Succe&s;s of it. And thus much &s;hall &s;uffice for a Preface to the&s;e E&s;&s;ays; which, if they meet with a favourable Ac|ceptance from the Public, may be hereafter followed by the Remainder of our epi&s;tolary Intercour&s;e, on the like ob&s;cure and contro|verted Places of the Sacred Writ.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>On the real Evidence of Miracles in general; and more particularly of tho&s;e which were wrought in Confir|mation of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Revelation.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Am not a little concerned to hear, that your Lot is &s;o unluckily fallen into a Pari&s;h where you are &s;o fre|quently attacked by your &s;ceptic Neighbours; who take an ungenerous De|light in pre&s;&s;ing you upon tho&s;e difficult
<PB N="2" REF="32">
Points of Scripture, in which they know you to be lea&s;t ver&s;ed; &s;uch as particularly the <HI>He|brew</HI> and other Ea&s;tern Tongues; the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Oeconomy, Antiquities, Laws, and Cu&s;toms. And it is greatly to be wi&s;h'd, either that there were not &s;o great a Number of our Clergy, who have, like you, been mi&s;led into a Neglect of &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a Branch of Learn|ing, or that they would, as often as they fall under the like Difficulties, make u&s;e of the &s;ame Method you have conde&s;cended to take, of &s;upplying that Defect, by appealing to &s;ome more proper Judge of every Point in Di&s;pute, rather than to &s;uffer the Authority of the &s;a|cred Hi&s;torians to be impaired thro' your want of Ability, as you mode&s;tly word it, of de|fending them. And I no le&s;s applaud your Prudence in the Choice of a Layman, who will, in all Probability, be thought le&s;s ex|ceptionable than a Clergyman, in a Contro|ver&s;y of this nature: But why you &s;hould &s;ingle me out for the Task, when you might &s;o ea&s;ily have pitch'd upon one of much &s;u|perior Ability, to an&s;wer the End, I can only a&s;cribe to that partial Satisfaction you lately expre&s;&s;ed, in reading &s;ome of my for|mer Ob&s;ervations on &s;everal ob&s;cure and
<PB N="3" REF="33">
controverted Points of the Old Te&s;tament. I &s;hall therefore the more readily accept of your Offer, as it will afford me an Opportu|nity of communicating to you, and your Neighbours, &s;ome more of the &s;ame kind, which I have had occa&s;ion to make during my long Rece&s;s from the World; and which, in all Likelihood, mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have lain neg|lected and u&s;ele&s;s by me. And I own my|&s;elf highly obliged to you, for having en|gaged your&s;elf to conceal my Name, unle&s;s permitted by me to do otherwi&s;e; which I cannot by any means con&s;ent to, upon &s;everal Con&s;iderations I need not trouble you and them with; one of which will, however, ea&s;ily occur to you, that it is too ob&s;cure, and too little known, to add any Weight to what I &s;hall tran&s;mit to you. On its own Merit let it &s;tand or fall. One thing you may indeed acquaint them with, becau&s;e it may, in all Probability, make a favourable Impre&s;&s;ion on them; <HI>viz.</HI> That the Writer is a Layman, who, tho' neither de&s;igned for, nor ever intending to enter into Holy Or|ders, hath yet cho&s;en to dedicate the greater Part of his latter Life to this kind of Study; but hath &s;till, for &s;ome not unworthy Rea|&s;ons,
<PB N="4" REF="34">
carefully concealed his Name; altho' &s;ome of his Productions have met with a good Reception from the Public. And as you are &s;ufficiently appri&s;ed, that this is my ca&s;e, &s;o it can hardly fail of meeting with a ready Belief from a Per&s;on of your &s;in|gular Integrity. Thus much in An&s;wer to the former Part of your Letter.</P>
<P>As to the Objections and Difficulties rai&s;ed by them again&s;t &s;everal miraculous and other hi&s;torical Facts, recorded in the Old Te&s;ta|ment<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The&s;e are particularly mentioned in the Title|page and Preface.</NOTE>, as I have long ago had occa&s;ion to examine them at my lei&s;ure Hours, &s;o I doubt not to convince them in the &s;ub&s;e|quent E&s;&s;ays, that they chiefly ari&s;e either from their not being &s;ufficiently acquainted with, or their not having given &s;ufficient Attention to, the peculiar Genius of the <HI>He|brew</HI> Idiom, the Laws, Di&s;cipline, and Cu&s;toms, of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and the uniform and general De&s;ign of Providence towards them; and more particularly to a Mi&s;apprehen&s;ion of their being calculated &s;olely in favour of that Nation; whereas, in fact, they were no le&s;s
<PB N="5" REF="35">
de&s;igned and fitted for the Benefit of the re&s;t of the heathen World. So that if your &s;ceptic Neighbours are the Per&s;ons of Sen&s;e and Candour you repre&s;ent them, I flat|ter my&s;elf I &s;hall find no great Difficulty in removing all that Heap of Doubts and Dif|ficulties which they have thrown in your way, with re&s;pect to the Facts in que&s;tion; and, at the &s;ame time, make it appear to their Satisfaction, that this admirable and long Series of Miracles which were wrought both in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and in the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> were &s;o far from being calculated in favour of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Nation only, that they are no le&s;s than a gradual and uniform Sequel of that di|vine Scheme, which had been laid ever &s;ince the Creation, for the Benefit of all Mankind, and was to be fully completed in the Per&s;on of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> when the Fulne&s;s of the Time was come.</P>
<P>In the mean while, as you inform me, that &s;ome of your Antagoni&s;is are great Ad|mirers of the noble Author of the <HI>Charac|teri&s;tics,</HI> of <HI>Collins, Tindal,</HI> the late Writer of the <HI>Moral Philo&s;opher,</HI> and other pro|fe&s;&s;ed Oppo&s;ers of Divine Revelation, and
<PB N="6" REF="36">
of the Miracles on which the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion are built, it will be highly requi&s;ite, before I proceed farther, to take a &s;hort Examen of the Arguments by which tho&s;e Authors pretend to prove, not only the Incredibility, but likewi&s;e the Impo&s;&s;ibility, of all Miracles in general, as well as of tho&s;e which are urged in Confirmation of the Law and Go&s;pel. Were a mere Stranger to gue&s;s at the Merit of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Revelation, by the indefatigable Pains which the&s;e pretended Well-wi&s;hers to Mankind, and public Society, have taken to overthrow it, he mu&s;t of cour&s;e conclude it to be one of the wor&s;t, and the mo&s;t dangerous, in&s;tead of the mo&s;t beneficial and comfortable Sy&s;tems of Religion in the World. And if we were to mea&s;ure the Succe&s;s of their Labour, either by the Num|ber of their Admirers, or by the victorious Applau&s;es they a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves, or have received from them, we could not hardly &s;up|po&s;e any thing but that they had long &s;ince gained their Point, and &s;ilenced all Oppo|&s;ers, by the mo&s;t irre&s;ragable Arguments, and cleare&s;t Demon&s;tration<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>De his vid. int. al.

And yet we
<PB N="7" REF="37">
plainly &s;ee, that as on the one hand they have never dared yet openly to impugn the excellent Morality of its Precepts, &s;o nei|ther have they been able, on the other, to undermine its Foundation, by all the Va|riety of Engines they have &s;et on work for that purpo&s;e. They have all, indeed, made &s;trong Efforts to cry down the Validity, Truth, Probability, and &s;ome of them even Po&s;&s;ibility, of tho&s;e numberle&s;s Miracles on which its Evidence is chiefly founded: They have left no Art untried, to expo&s;e them as contrary to Rea&s;on, and the Experience of Mankind, and what they know of the &s;tated Laws and Cour&s;e of Nature: They have re|pre&s;ented them as incon&s;i&s;tent with the Im|mutability of the Supreme Being, and as in|&s;ufficient Evidences of the Doctrines they are urged in Proof of. Some of them have endeavour'd to expo&s;e the Law, and the Go|&s;pel, as unnece&s;&s;ary and impertinent Revela|tions; <HI>Mens natural Faculties being able to teach them the mo&s;t excellent Morals, to fur|ni&s;h them with the mo&s;t effectual Incentives to</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="38">
<HI>the Ob&s;ervation of them, and to in&s;pire them with the true&s;t Notions of the Divine Na|ture, and a well grounded Belief of a Su|preme Being, and his Providence:</HI> Which, if true, overturns at once the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Revelation, and of the Miracles urged in Proof of it. Others again as po&s;itively affirm, that &s;uch Revelations were not only need|le&s;s, but that the admitting of any &s;uch, implies &s;ome extraordinary Defect in the mo|rai World, which requires a Divine Inter|po&s;ition to amend it: Whereas all God's Works, being the Re&s;ult of infinite Wi&s;dom, Power, and Goodne&s;s, can never be &s;uppo|&s;ed to &s;tand in need of any Amendment, much le&s;s of a Divine Interpo&s;ition to rectify them. La&s;tly, they affirm, with the &s;ame A&s;|&s;urance, that if &s;uch an Interpo&s;ition of the Divine Power was ever requi&s;ite upon that, or any other Occa&s;ion, it mu&s;t have been always, and ever continue to be &s;o. If Miracles, therefore, were thought nece&s;&s;ary or expedient at any time, they mu&s;t be &s;o at all times; becau&s;e, &s;ay they, whoever &s;uppo&s;es God to have wrought them in one Generation, and not in another, mu&s;t of

cour&s;e look upon him as a partial Being<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Con&s;ider. ubi &s;up.</HI> p. 98. Edit. 3. p. 82.</NOTE>. This is the Sum and Sub&s;tance of all their Arguments again&s;t the Reality, Evidence, and Po&s;&s;ibility, of Miracles: In con&s;equence of which, they have made no Scruple to con|demn them all in the Lump, as Delu&s;ions and vile Impo&s;itions upon Mankind; and the Recorders of them, be their Character what it will in other re&s;pects, as Dealers in For|geries and Mon&s;tro&s;ities, and unworthy any Credit or Regard<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hume's E&s;&s;ay on Miracles,</HI> p. 179, &amp; <HI>&s;eq.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>From this &s;hort Scantling I have given of the Premi&s;es and Conclu&s;ion, you, and your &s;ceptic Neighbours, may clearly &s;ee what Pains tho&s;e Authors have taken to eradicate, as far as po&s;&s;ible, the very Notion of a Divine Re|velation, founded on Miracles, out of the World. And it was natural for them to prefer that expeditious Way to any other: And &s;ince they could not &s;tand again&s;t the Shafts that galled them from that Battery, to endeavour, by any means, to blow it up.

thus much in Ju&s;tice to them, that their Di&s;|appointment is owing to &s;ome other Cau&s;e, than to the want of Zeal, or hard &s;truggling for it, on their Part: Whil&s;t tho&s;e who re|flect more ju&s;tly upon it, will, probably, be reminded of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s infallible Promi&s;e to his Church<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matth.</HI> xvi. 18.</NOTE>, that he would protect it to the End of Time, and again&s;t much more powerful and dangerous Attempts than any of the&s;e Gentlemen can make again&s;t it.

<P>Hence then we may &s;afely conclude, that Miracles were &s;o far from being &s;uch impro|per Evidences of God's gracious De&s;ign of reclaiming a degenerate World from that Multitude of Errors and Enormities, into which it was irretrievably immerged, that they appear to have been the mo&s;t effectual, if not the only Means, that could bring about &s;o de&s;irable a Change; as they were mo&s;t apt to awaken the Attention of Man|kind; appealed to their rational Faculties, without offering any Violence to their Free|dom;

And fir&s;t, they tell us, that <HI>&s;uch a miraculous Revelation is incon&s;i&s;tent with God's Immuta|bility, one of his mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Attributes;</HI> that is, according to their Logic, if God is

immutable in his Nature, he mu&s;t be like|wi&s;e &s;o in his Actions. Wild Conclu&s;ion this! and of no Force, unle&s;s they can al&s;o prove all his Creatures to be as unchangeable as him&s;elf, than which nothing is more con|trary to all Ob&s;ervation and Experience, nor more ab&s;urd and unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, and much more &s;o with re&s;pect to the moral World: For if the Experience of all Ages &s;hews it to have been in a con&s;tant Fluctua|tion; if whole Nations appear to have &s;unk from a good Pitch of Learning, to the lowe&s;t Dregs of Ignorance; from the true&s;t and &s;ub|lime&s;t Notions of the Supreme Being, and of the pure Wor&s;hip that is due to him, to the ba&s;e&s;t Degrees of Idolatry and Super&s;ti|tion; and from the noble&s;t Sentiments of Virtue and Morality, to the mo&s;t &s;hameful Degeneracy and Corruption, both in Theory and Practice; what Rea&s;on can there be to &s;uppo&s;e, much le&s;s to affirm &s;o peremptorily, as our Oppo&s;ers do, that a <HI>Divine Interpo&s;i|tion mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be contrary to his Im|mutability?</HI> Is it not rather more ju&s;t to in|fer, that the very Immutability of his Nature and Coun&s;els mu&s;t incline, I might &s;ay, oblige him to alter his Mea&s;ures with his Creatures,

as often as he &s;ees them deviate from, or go contrary to them, or aba&s;e tho&s;e Faculties, and that Freedom of Choice, with which he had endowed them, to Purpo&s;es quite oppo&s;ite to the Ends for which he had created them? Can a Clock-maker be &s;aid to change his Mind or De&s;ign, when he goes about mend|ing what is ami&s;s in a Clock; or a Phy&s;ician, when the Irregularity of his Patient obliges him to alter his Pre&s;criptions, and Method of treating him, in order to his Recovery? Much more ab&s;urd, if not impious, will it be, to infer a Mutability in the Supreme and All-wi&s;e Being, who, foreknowing from all Eternity all the po&s;&s;ible Exigencies of his moral World, and the ill U&s;e Men would make of tho&s;e Faculties, and the Liberty, with which he had endowed them, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be thought to have decreed likewi&s;e, in his eternal Coun&s;el, a proper Supply for every Want, and Remedy for every Di&s;order: So that every &s;uch extraordinary Interpo&s;ition, as we are contending for, that is, where the Subject is worthy of it, is &s;o far from im|plying any thing like a Mutability in the God|head, as our Oppo&s;ers would infer, that it is in Reality no other than an Effect of his

eternal and unalterable Decrees. I dare ven|ture to appeal to every con&s;idering Man, whe|ther Immutability, in this Sen&s;e, is not more truly, and every way, worthy of the Divine Nature, than that which our Oppo&s;ers attri|bute to him, and which repre&s;ents the whole Creation as a mere large Piece of compound Mechani&s;m; which, having been once &s;et in Motion by its Maker, is left to go on its own Way, without any farther Care or Regard from him, notwith&s;tanding that great Variety of Di&s;orders and Irregularities which is &s;een and felt in our moral Part of it?</P>

And when could there be a more worthy one, than when Mankind were not only &s;unk into the mo&s;t di&s;honour|able Notions of the Deity, and the mo&s;t abo|minable Rites in his Wor&s;hip; but had even degenerated &s;o far, as to &s;helter them under the Sanction of his Authority and In&s;titution, barring up by that means, all po&s;&s;ible Ave|nues again&s;t Conviction, and rendering the Di&s;temper incurable by any other Means, but that of a new Revelation of him&s;elf, and his divine Will?

To make this A&s;&s;ertion appear more plau&s;ible,

<ARGUMENT>
<P>On the Lord's Judgments threatened and executed upon the Gods of <HI>Egypt, Exod. xii.</HI> 11. <HI>ad fin.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Text, you may remember, runs thus: <HI>For I will pa&s;s through the Land of</HI> Egypt <HI>this Night, and will &s;mite all the Fir&s;t-born in the Land of</HI> Egypt, <HI>both Man and Bea&s;t; and again&s;t all the Gods of</HI> Egypt <HI>will I execute Judgments. I am the Lord.</HI> But what is meant by <HI>the Gods of Egypt,</HI> and in what manner this <HI>Judgment was executed upon them</HI> by God, is what hath hitherto been variou&s;ly, and, I may add, un&s;atisfactorily accounted for, by all the Expo&s;itors I have hitherto met with; &s;ome of them interpreting the Words <HI>Elohe Mizraim,</HI> the Gods of <HI>Egypt,</HI> of the Princes or Rulers of that Nation, which are &s;ome|times in the Scriptures &s;tiled Gods (P&s;al. lxxxii. 6) and who, following their King in his Pur|&s;uit of the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> peri&s;hed with him, and his Ho&s;t, in the <HI>Red Sea:</HI> Others under&s;tand|ing the Word <HI>Elohim</HI> to mean no more than the <HI>Idols,</HI> which they carried about with
<PB N="54" REF="84">
them in their Armies on all &s;uch Emergencies, and which were all &s;wallowed up by the Waves on that remarkable Night. In this Sen&s;e, the antient <HI>Jews,</HI> and particularly the Author of the Book of <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> under&s;tood it; and the latter &s;ubjoins the following Remark upon the extraordinary Completion of that threatened Judgment, <HI>That the Idol which is made with Hands is cur&s;ed, as well as he that made it, being both alike hateful to God, and both de&s;erving to be puni&s;hed by him: Therefore,</HI> adds he, <HI>upon the Idols of the</HI> Gentiles <HI>&s;hall there be a Vi&s;itation, becau&s;e the Creature of God is made thereby to be|come an Abomination, and a Stumbling|block, to the Souls of Men, a Snare to the Feet of the Unwi&s;e, the Occa&s;ion of &s;piritual Fornication, and of the Corruption of Mens Lives.</HI> Wi&s;d. xiv. 8-12.</P>
<P>But whoever &s;eriou&s;ly weighs the Impor|tance, Dignity, and De&s;ign, of this whole miraculous Tran&s;action, will hardly allow either of tho&s;e Interpretations to be an&s;wer|able to, or worthy of, &s;uch a &s;olemn and dreadful Denunciation. Fir&s;t, Not an&s;wer|able to it, becau&s;e this Judgment was to be
<PB N="55" REF="85">
executed not at the fatal De&s;truction of the <HI>Egyptians</HI> at the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> but on the &s;ame Night in which all the Fir&s;t-born of the Na|tion were to be miraculou&s;ly cut off. Se|condly, Not worthy of it, becau&s;e, from the very Tenour of it, it plainly appears to be levelled again&s;t &s;omething greater than Princes or Magi&s;trates, who were to be alike Suffer|ers with the re&s;t of the People in the Lo&s;s of their Fir&s;t-born, from <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> their haughty Monarch, down to the lowe&s;t Slave in his Dominions; and much le&s;s can it be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been levelled again&s;t their dumb and &s;en&s;ele&s;s Idols. The Words there|fore which we tran&s;late, <HI>I will execute Judg|ment,</HI> or rather <HI>Judgments,</HI> as the Text hath it, mu&s;t mean &s;omething of an higher Nature than the bare drowning of their Rulers or Idols in the <HI>Red Sea;</HI> and the Words <HI>Ani Jehovah,</HI> which conclude the Ver&s;e, and which we tran&s;late, <HI>I am the Lord,</HI> but may be more properly rendered, I, even I, <HI>Jehovah,</HI> or the Supreme Being, <HI>will per|form it,</HI> plainly &s;hew, that nothing le&s;s here is threatened, than the whole Colluvies of fal&s;e <HI>Egyptian</HI> Deities, as they &s;tand ju&s;tly oppo&s;ed to the true and only God, whom
<PB N="56" REF="86">
<HI>Pharaoh</HI> had hitherto refu&s;ed to acknowlege, notwith&s;tanding the Variety of Miracles which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> had already wrought in his Name, and &s;uch as the very <HI>Magicians</HI> had been forced to own were wrought by the only Finger of the Supreme Being.</P>
<P>But to make this, and what I am farther to &s;ay, in order to di&s;play the genuine Sen&s;e of the Text in Que&s;tion, &s;till plainer, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to take the Matter a little higher, and make &s;ome previous Remarks on the Nature and De&s;ign of this divine and mira|culous Di&s;pen&s;ation, from the Account which the in&s;pired <HI>Hebrew</HI> Lawgiver hath given us of it; and from which it will plainly ap|pear, that tho the Deliverance of the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> from their pre&s;ent dreadful Thraldom &s;eems to be the main Point in View; yet God had &s;till a much higher and nobler De&s;ign in it, namely, to convince not only the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> now more immediately concerned in it, but by that means all other Nations, far and near, of the&s;e three important Truths; <HI>viz.</HI> I. That the Lord <HI>Jehovah,</HI> whom the <HI>Hebrews</HI> wor&s;hiped, was the Supreme Being, the Creator, and &s;ole Governor and Di&s;po&s;er, of
<PB N="57" REF="87">
all Things. 2. That all the other pretended Deities, which either the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> or any other heathen Nations, wor&s;hiped, as Mediators and Benefactors, whether the cele&s;tial Bodies, Angels, Demons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were either Fictions of their own Brain, or, at be&s;t, Beings created by him, and intirely &s;ubordinate to his &s;u|preme Power and Di&s;po&s;al. And, 3. That the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> now groaning under their &s;evere Servitude, were the peculiar People of that one only Supreme and Almighty Being; in con&s;equence of which he &s;ent <HI>Pharaoh</HI> this &s;pecial Me&s;&s;age, and ab&s;olute Command, to let them go and &s;erve him, under the dread|ful Penalty, in ca&s;e of Refu&s;al, of being made to feel the mo&s;t &s;evere Effects of his Anger and Re&s;entment. This la&s;t is plainly implied in tho&s;e Words of God to <HI>Mo&s;es</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Exod.</HI> iv. 22, 23. <HI>vid. &amp; Cap.</HI> vii. 17. ix. 13. <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI> x. 2. <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI> x. <HI>pa&s;&s;.</HI></NOTE>: <HI>Thus &s;halt thnu &s;ay unto Pharaoh: Thus &s;ays the Lord</HI> (or <HI>Jebovah,</HI> the &s;upreme and only God), <HI>I&s;rael is my Son, Fir&s;t-born; and I &s;ay unto thee, Let I&s;rael go, that he may &s;erve me; and, if thou refu&s;e to let him go, behold, I will &s;lay thy Son, even thy Fir&s;t-born.</HI></P>

With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t of the&s;e three grand Points; <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>Jehovah,</HI> the God of the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> was the Supreme Creator and Go|vernor of all Things; it is a Thing, which, con&s;idering the then reigning Theology of the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> and the mi&s;erable Figure which the <HI>Hebrews</HI> then made in the World, could hardly come into the Head of <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> or of any of his People. Some of them had, indeed, a right Notion of a Supreme Being, whom they called <HI>Cneph,</HI> or <HI>Eneph,</HI> and believed him to be the Creator, or, as they &s;tiled him, the Architect of the World, and the only immortal God<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plutarch in I&s;id. &amp; O&s;irid. vid. &amp; Cumberland in Co&s;mog.

<P>As to the time of this Inva&s;ion, <HI>S.

But it is more likely, that they had already been driven out of <HI>Egypt</HI> by <HI>Amo&s;is,</HI> King of <HI>Thebais,</HI> or <HI>Upper Egypt,</HI> &s;ome time before <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s being &s;old thi|ther; and that thence pro|ceeded the Aver&s;ion which the <HI>Egyptians</HI> bore to all Shepherds<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gene&s;is</HI> xliii. 32. xlvi. 34.</NOTE>. It is true, there is another Rea&s;on given for that Aver&s;ion, but &s;uch as carries but little Weight; <HI>viz. Becau&s;e the Shepherds &s;lew, and lived upon the Fle&s;h of, tho&s;e Sheep, Oxen,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>which the</HI> Egyp|tians <HI>wor&s;hiped.</HI> But this could ea&s;ily have been pre|vented, by making &s;ome &s;evere Law again&s;t it; and then, in all other re&s;pects, the Shepherds Life would have been an honourable one, they being the Guar|dians and Protectors of tho&s;e &s;acred Animals. And ac|cordingly we are told, that the Goatherds of the Pro|vince of <HI>Mendez</HI> were highly re&s;pected, where that Crea|ture was held in particular Veneration<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot"><HI>Herod.</HI> lib. ii. c. 42.</NOTE>. It is more likely therefore, that their Aver&s;ion to Shepherds was owing to that Slavery which they underwent under them, during the Space of almo&s;t 260 Years; and that they were <HI>Canaanites,</HI> who fled from tho&s;e Wars which every petty Kingdom waged, from the earlie&s;t of time, again&s;t each other; of which, &s;ee <HI>Gen.</HI> xiv. <HI>pa&s;&s;.</HI></P></NOTE>; for the&s;e,
<PB N="61" REF="91">

any of the Monarchs of <HI>Lower Egypt,</HI> and, we may add, of any other heathen Nation, would, upon the like Occa&s;ion, have behaved in the very &s;ame manner; e&s;pecially as it was backed with no better Authority than that of the Me&s;&s;enger's bare Word. However, whe|ther that <HI>Pharaoh</HI> was of <HI>Egyptian,</HI> or any other Race; and whether the Meaning of his An&s;wer was, that he did not know or acknowlege &s;uch a Supreme Deity; or that he did not believe this pretended God of the <HI>Hebrews</HI> to be Him; it plainly appears by the whole Tenour of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s Commi&s;&s;ion and Miracles, that God's De&s;ign was to convince him, and his People, of both tho&s;e important Truths, by &s;uch infallible Signs as &s;hould at once extort from him a free Confe&s;&s;ion of them, and an infallible Compliance with the Divine Command.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Point which the <HI>Egyptians</HI> were to be made &s;en&s;ible of, by this Divine Me&s;&s;age, and which is but a natural Con&s;e|quence of the fir&s;t, was, that all the other pretended Deities, both of the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> and other heathen Nations, whether Angels, Demons, and the like, or the Stars and Planets,
<PB N="63" REF="93">
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> were either mere Illu&s;ions and Fictions of Mens Brains, or, at be&s;t, but Beings created by <HI>Jehovah,</HI> the Supreme Creator and Go|vernor of the Univer&s;e; and wholly &s;ubor|dinate to his over-ruling Power, and unerring Providence.

could be no room for &s;uppo&s;ing, that tho&s;e of any other Nation could have been more &s;uc|ce&s;sful in it. St. <HI>Paul</HI> mentions only two Magicians who with&s;tood <HI>Mo&s;es; viz.

<P>Accordingly the Conte&s;t proceeds gradually on between <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the Magicians, and in &s;uch a manner, that the former hath vi&s;ibly the Advantage over the latter. Both turn their Rods into Serpents at the fir&s;t Trial, and that of <HI>Aaron</HI> &s;wallows up all the re&s;t: And this perhaps is not without its particular Meaning; that as the Serpent was ever look|ed upon as the Emblem of Wi&s;dom and Cun|ning<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gene&s;is</HI> iii. 1. <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> xxvii. 1. <HI>Matth.</HI> x. 16.</NOTE>, &s;o that of the Magicians would be forced to yield to that of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><HI>Exod.</HI> vii. 12.</NOTE>.

But it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the <HI>Egyptians</HI> were very tenacious of their Su|per&s;titions about the <HI>Nile;</HI> becau&s;e on them they ima|gined the Ri&s;ing of it to its u&s;ual Height chiefly de|pended; in&s;omuch that they would doubtle&s;s have ri&s;en in Arms rather than forego them. So that if it was at any time inter|rupted by the Authority of tho&s;e Emperors, it con|tinued no longer &s;o than till they found an Oppor|tunity of reviving it.</P>
<P>This was likely to have proved the Ca&s;e, when their <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Governor above-mentioned fir&s;t at|tempted to &s;uppre&s;s it: For that River not ri&s;ing on the next Year to its u&s;ual Mark, and the fol|lowing one proving &s;till wor&s;e, the People were all ready to revolt, and tear him in Pieces: Upon which he per&s;uaded them, <HI>Jews, Turks,</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> to accompany him to a neigh|bouring Mountain; and there exhorted them to &s;trive, by fervent Prayers to God, to obtain the Ble&s;&s;ing they wanted: And on the next Morning they were congratulated with the joyful News, that the River had ri&s;en in that Night twelve full Pikes. It continued doing &s;o during the re&s;t of the time; and that Year was ble&s;&s;ed with &s;uch extraordinary Plenty, that whenever its Waters are like to fail, they have had ever &s;ince recour&s;e to that Moun|tain, and to their Prayers, in&s;tead of their inhuman Sacrifices<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lucas, Thevenot. ub. &s;up.</HI></NOTE>.</P></NOTE>, at lea&s;t by that of &s;o many

The &s;ame happened to them in the third Trial, where their Skill could only help them to increa&s;e the Number and Stench of tho&s;e va&s;t Swarms of Frogs, which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> had al|ready brought over all the Land, and with the Stink of who&s;e Carca&s;es the Air was but too much infected to want any Addition.</P>
<P>Here then was one of their chief Deities fairly tried and condemned, in two &s;uch In&s;tances, as might have convinced the &s;en&s;ele&s;s <HI>Egyptians,</HI> how ea&s;ily that River, in which they placed &s;o great a Confidence, and which they looked upon as one of their

greate&s;t Ble&s;&s;ings, could be turned into the greate&s;t Cur&s;e, by the bare Stroke of the mi|raculous Rod; and that nothing but the Di|vine Power could re&s;tore it to its native U&s;e|fulne&s;s and Fecundity<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><HI>Exod.</HI> viii. 1, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI></NOTE>; whil&s;t the Art of the Magicians here proved vain and in|effectual.</P>
<P>The fourth Trial was that of the Lice; a Trial, to all Appearance, as ea&s;y, if not more &s;o, to be imitated, than any of the former; but in which, however, they are &s;o unex|pectedly foiled, that they make no Difficulty to own their Impotence and Di&s;appointment to be the Effect of a Divine Power<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid. Ver&s;e</HI> 19.</NOTE>. Hence &s;ome Divines have been induced to believe, that this &s;mall Vermin was a new Kind of Creature, and out of the Power of any but God to produce; whereas the Mi|racle here chiefly con&s;i&s;ted in re&s;training the Power of tho&s;e Magicians from working a Mi|racle, every whit as ea&s;y as tho&s;e they had done before; and thereby forcing them to acknow|lege that &s;uperior Power, or, as they expre&s;&s;|ed it to the King, the Finger of God, which
<PB N="102" REF="132">
was the Cau&s;e of it; by which both he and they might &s;ee, that what they had hitherto performed was chiefly owing to his Divine Permi&s;&s;ion, beyond which they found it im|po&s;&s;ible to go. And this the Magicians &s;o readily acknowleged, that we do not find, that the King made any farther Trial of their Art, or that they intermeddled any far|ther in the Conte&s;t.</P>
<P>However, as <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Magicians appeared &s;o little affected by the Advantage which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> had hitherto gain'd over them in it, that there is Rea&s;on to think he did not believe them, if he did not indeed &s;u&s;pect them to have been privately drawn in to act in concert with the two <HI>Hebrew</HI> Chiefs, it was requi&s;ite that the &s;ucceeding Plagues &s;hould be of a more pungent and awakening Nature; and, by falling on the Magicians, as well as the re&s;t of the People, remove all po&s;&s;ible Su&s;picion of any latent Juggle or Confederacy. Ac|cordingly the next was that of the Swarm of Flies, which, by their poi&s;onous Sting, &s;o terribly annoyed both Man and Bea&s;t, that the Air was now as much infected with them, as the Earth and Water had been by the
<PB N="103" REF="133">
Frogs, and the River turned into Blood<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><HI>Exod.</HI> viii. 20, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI></NOTE>. But what was &s;till more &s;ingular and won|derful in this new one was, that tho&s;e little poi&s;onous In&s;ects were directed to make a Difference between the Land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and the Canton of <HI>Go&s;hen;</HI> &s;o that they had no more Power to annoy an <HI>I&s;raelite,</HI> than to &s;pare an <HI>Egyptian:</HI> And this &s;o plainly &s;hewed them to be &s;ent by an angry God, and not by Chance or Art, that <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> un|able to re&s;i&s;t &s;uch an Evidence, con&s;ents to let <HI>I&s;rael</HI> go and &s;acrifice to their God, if he will but vouch&s;afe to rid him of this Plague<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid. Ver&s;e</HI> 28.</NOTE>; tho' he continues &s;till hardened, as &s;oon as it is removed. And here I cannot but ob&s;erve, once for all, that God not only made the &s;ame remarkable Difference be|tween the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> and <HI>Egyptians,</HI> in the Murrain of Bea&s;ts, in the Boils and Blains, which affected the very Magicians them&s;elves, as well as the King and People; but likewi&s;e &s;et the Space of a Day between the Me&s;&s;age and the Plague, as well as between the Pro|mi&s;e and the Removing.

<HI>it to pa&s;s;</HI> and in the other it is &s;aid, <HI>To|morrow I will intreat the Lord, and he &s;hall remove it.</HI> The Intent of which &s;eems plainly to give them Time to apply to tho&s;e fal&s;e Deities, in whom they put &s;o much Confidence, and try whether any of them were able, either to avert the threatened Judgment, or to remove it when inflicted: For if none of them could do either of the&s;e, what could be a greater Demon&s;tration, that all the Power that was fal&s;ly attributed to them was mere Delu&s;ion, and that con&s;equently there was no other God in Heaven, or on Earth, except the Lord <HI>Jehovah?</HI> This <HI>Pharaob</HI> could not but be deeply &s;en&s;ible of; but the Thoughts of di&s;mi&s;&s;ing &s;o many My|riads of u&s;eful Slaves, made &s;till a much &s;tronger Impre&s;&s;ion upon him; and, tho' ex|tremely de&s;irous to have each Plague removed from him, yet he would willingly purcha&s;e the Ble&s;&s;ing at the cheape&s;t Rate.

<P>Accordingly, the very next proves a more dreadful and awakening one than any of the former; as it extended it&s;elf beyond the four Elements, even to the cele&s;tial Bodies, and more particularly over the two grand Lumi|naries, which were wor&s;hiped by the <HI>Egyp|tians</HI> as the chief and mo&s;t powerful of all their Deities, and as the immediate Vicegerents of their great <HI>Eneph,</HI> or &s;upreme Being<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><HI>See before, page</HI> 58 (B).</NOTE>.

Darkne&s;s that might be felt<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Exod.</HI> x. 21, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI></NOTE>; and that, in &s;uch a Degree, that they had neither Power nor Will to &s;tir out of their Places: So that being left wholly to the Horror of their Thoughts, they either imagined tho&s;e Lu|minaries, together with the whole Train of cele&s;tial Bodies, to be totally extingui&s;hed; or that the whole Creation was returning to its original <HI>Chaos.</HI> Now they had Lei&s;ure to reflect upon all the former Puni&s;hments they had undergone, and to think, with awful Dread, how punctually the Lord God of the <HI>Hebrews</HI> had fulfilled all that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> had foretold to them; and how ineffectual all their Addre&s;&s;es to their numerous Deities had been, towards averting or removing any of his Pu|ni&s;hments. They are now convinced, to their Co&s;t, that this Lord is, as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> truly &s;aid, the only &s;upreme Being, to who&s;e irre|&s;i&s;tible Will all things are forced to &s;ubmit; but dare not apply to him for Mercy, for fear of incen&s;ing his Anger &s;till more again&s;t them. The only Remedy that <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and his People can think of, to &s;upport them un|der their heavy Load of Dread, is to endea|vour to appea&s;e it, both by an immediate

<P>This, at lea&s;t, appears by the Sequel, to have been the Re&s;ult of <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s moody Thoughts, during the Time of this long and dreadful Night.

<P>3<HI>dly,</HI> This De&s;truction was an infallible Proof, both of the &s;overeign Power of the God of the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> and of the Vanity of the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Deities; becau&s;e in this, and all other Nations, the Prie&s;thood and Primoge|niture were always joined together: So that the Fir&s;t-born of every Family was always the Prie&s;t of tho&s;e Deities which were the Object of their Wor&s;hip<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot"><P>That, during the pa|triarchal Oeconomy, the Fir&s;t-born, or Heads of eve|ry Family, were al&s;o the Prie&s;ts of it, is too plain to need any Proof: From which we may rea&s;onably infer, that this Hierarchy was of Divine Appoint|ment. <HI>Noah,</HI> as &s;uch, &s;a|crificed to God for him|&s;elf, and the &s;mall Remains that were &s;aved with him in the Ark<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gene&s;is</HI> viii. 20. xii. 7, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI> xv. 9, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI> xxv. 31, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI> xxxiii. 19, 20. xxxv. 1, <HI>&amp; &s;eq. &amp; alib. pa&s;&s;.</HI></NOTE>. <HI>Abraham, I&s;aac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> did the &s;ame in their re&s;pective Fa|milies, after they became their Heads: And &s;o doubt|le&s;s did the twelve Sons of <HI>Jacob,</HI> after they were part|ed from him; though it is hardly to be doubted but that he &s;till retained a kind of &s;upreme Authority over them, in this, as well as in his civil Capacity, whil&s;t he lived; and which de|&s;cended after his Death to his elde&s;t Son, unle&s;s he were on &s;ome account di&s;|qualified for it, as <HI>Reuben</HI> was, who forfeited both the Prie&s;thood and Primo|geniture, by his ince&s;tuous Commerce with his Fa|ther's Concubine<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gene&s;is</HI> xxxv. 22. xlix. 3, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is therefore more rea|&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that this Hierarchy, as the mo&s;t rational, convenient, and primitive, was continued among the other De&s;cend|ents of <HI>Noah;</HI> and that <HI>Mizraim,</HI> the fir&s;t Peopler of <HI>Egypt,</HI> introduced it thither; than that they &s;hould leave the Choice of their Prie&s;ts to the caprici|ous Votes of the People, or to the Nomination of the Heads of them.

<P>Whether this famous Per&s;on was a real Prophet, and Wor&s;hiper of the true God, or an Heathen, and a mere Conjurer, or Sooth&s;ayer, is, you know, much di&s;puted by the Learned among <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> both antient and modern.

<P N="5">5. His opening the Mouth of the dumb A&s;s, to reprimand him for his pretended ill|tim'd Re&s;entment and Cruelty.</P>
<P>And, la&s;tly, The &s;trange Reproof, and &s;trict Charge, of the Angel to him; the one for abu&s;ing his Bea&s;t; and the other, not to act or &s;peak otherwi&s;e than God &s;hould &s;ee fit to direct him<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Numb.</HI> xxii. 5-35.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Let us now examine each of the&s;e Arti|cles by the Rules of Rea&s;on; and &s;ee whe|ther, upon an impartial Examination, they will appear in that ridiculous Light in which he hath &s;tated them; or not rather as uniform and well conducted Series of Events, all tending to the End propo&s;ed; the reducing tho&s;e in|fatuated Nations from their vain Confidence in their fal&s;e Deities, to a due Sen&s;e of, and a &s;teady Reliance on, God's all-wi&s;e and over-ruling Providence, in a way the mo&s;t adapt|ed
<PB N="155" REF="185">
to their Capacities, and, at the &s;ame time, the mo&s;t effectual to convince rational Crea|tures, without the lea&s;t Infringement on their natural Liberty.</P>
<P>1<HI>&s;t,</HI> then, With re&s;pect to the pretended Improbability of God's endowing a Per&s;on of <HI>Balaam</HI>'s Character with the Gift of Pro|phecy, I cannot &s;ee whence it ari&s;es: And it being his declared De&s;ign to convince tho&s;e &s;uper&s;titious Nations, who placed no &s;mall Confidence in their pretended Prophets, of his over-ruling Power; where is the Ab&s;urdi|ty, or even Wonder, if, in compliance with their Notion, he &s;hould rai&s;e a real one among them, that &s;hould fully an&s;wer that End? But why &s;hould he make Choice of one of his vile Character? Mo&s;t probably, becau&s;e one of a better would not have an&s;wered the End propo&s;ed; and his ble&s;&s;ing <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> in|&s;tead of cur&s;ing them, might have been looked upon as the Effect of his Zeal for that favourite Nation of Providence, and of his Hatred to the idolatrous Notions and Rites of the <HI>Moabites</HI> and <HI>Midianites;</HI> where|as a Per&s;on of <HI>Balaam</HI>'s unbounded Ambition and Avarice, and moreover addicted to the

reigning Sorceries and Inchantments of tho&s;e Times, being forced, again&s;t his own Incli|nation and Intere&s;t, to ble&s;s tho&s;e, whom <HI>Balak</HI> would have bribed him, at any Rate, to cur&s;e, could not but convince them, as well as all the re&s;t of his Behaviour on this Occa&s;ion did, that he was driven to it by a &s;u|perior, or rather irre&s;i&s;tible Power; as, on the other hand, had he been le&s;s than a real Prophet, or had he been, as many learned Men have &s;uppo&s;ed him, only a mere Conjurer or Inchanter, all that he uttered in favour of the <HI>I&s;raeliti&s;h</HI> People, might have been imputed either to his Want of Skill, or to a &s;udden, inward Fear of bringing &s;ome hea|vy Re&s;entment from them upon his Head, or to any other Cau&s;e, rather than to &s;uch a divine and irre&s;i&s;tible Impul&s;e.</P>
<P>But here your Antagoni&s;t further objects again&s;t the Probability of God's conde&s;cend|ing to conver&s;e, or, as he mode&s;tly words it, to dialogue it, with &s;uch an infamous Con|jurer, or, at be&s;t, a ba&s;e Pro&s;tituter of the prophetic Gift.

&s;uffered to go with the fir&s;t, who, the Text intimates, were but few in Number, and Per&s;ons of a lower Rank; their Report of the extraordinary Oppo&s;ition which he was to meet with on the Way, having no other Witne&s;&s;es than they, and the Prophet's two Servants, might have been liable to Su&s;pi|cion; and &s;o failed of making a due Impre&s;|&s;ion on tho&s;e that had &s;ent them.

<P>3<HI>dly,</HI> But here the next Objection &s;tarted by your Antagoni&s;t is, Why was God angry with <HI>Balaam</HI> for going with the Me&s;&s;engers, &s;eeing he had not only permitted, but or|dered, him to do &s;o? The common Solution which the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Writers give us, is, that <HI>Balaam</HI> flattered him&s;elf, that God had or might be prevailed upon to al|ter his Intentions with re&s;pect to the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> either by his Sacrifices or Inchantments; by which means he would gain &s;ome con&s;idera|ble Preferment, as well as great Reputation, among the <HI>Moabites.</HI> But if this had been the only Cau&s;e of God's Anger, would he not more probably have &s;uffered him to go on in his fond Conceit, and then puni&s;hed his Pre&s;umption, in the Face of <HI>Moab</HI> and <HI>Midian;</HI> either by forcing him to ble&s;s, in|&s;tead of cur&s;ing, or by turning his Cur&s;es into

But this Rencounter, as related and cir|cum&s;tantiated by the in&s;pired Hi&s;torian, is, it &s;eems, what your Antagoni&s;t thinks can|not be treated with too great Contempt. A celebrated Prophet and Diviner, and con&s;e|quently a Per&s;on well acquainted of cour&s;e with &s;uch Vi&s;ions, is oppo&s;ed by an Angel, with a drawn Sword; yet goes re&s;olutely on, in&s;en&s;ible of his Danger; whil&s;t the Bea&s;t he rides on, the mo&s;t &s;tupid Animal of the whole Creation, is clear-&s;ighted enough to perceive and avoid it, by turning out of the Way, and &s;aves her Rider from running blindfold into it. This is repeated twice more, in two &s;uch narrow Paths, that the A&s;s is forced, in the one, to cru&s;h her Rider's Foot again&s;t the Wall; and, in the other, to crouch down upon her Belly, to avoid his ru&s;hing on his De&s;truction; for which ex|traordinary Care and Concern &s;he is only re|warded with a &s;evere Drubbing. Which, &s;ays your Friend, de&s;erves the greater Admiration or Laughter; the Per&s;picuity and Prudence of the dumb Creature, or the Stupidity and In|gratitude of the Prophet? But what is even this, compared to the &s;urpri&s;ing Dialogue

<P>I have now given your Antagoni&s;t's Ob|jections their full Strength, tho' not couched them in his ludicrous and &s;arca&s;tical Terms; to avoid, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the di&s;ta&s;teful Contra&s;t that would appear between them, and the Seriou&s;ne&s;s with which the Subject, whatever he may think to the contrary, de|&s;erves to be treated. In doing which I &s;hall not, like &s;ome of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Writers, have recour&s;e to allegorical and other elu&s;ory Subterfuges<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot"><HI>Maimonides,</HI> and &s;ome other <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Writers, pretend that this whole Scene was tran&s;acted only in a Vi&s;ion, in which they have been followed by &s;ome Chri&s;tians. Others think, that the whole Tran&s;action mu&s;t be un|der&s;tood in an allegorical Sen&s;e; that the A&s;s was &s;topped from going on by &s;ome extraordinary Im|pul&s;e; that the Blows which its Rider gave it &s;et it not a &s;peaking articu|lately, but a braying; which he, however, ei|ther by his conjuring Skill, or his Acquaintance with the Language of Brutes, rightly interpreted as a ju&s;t Rebuke for &s;triking her.

from whom they had nothing to fear; and con&s;equently, no Grounds for any &s;uch ho&s;tile Stratagems, as they were hatching again&s;t them; and who, being under the Guidance and Protection of an infinitely &s;u|perior Power to all their pretended Dei|ties, were out of the Reach of all their ma|licious Darts, unle&s;s it were to return them with double Force on their own Heads.</P>
<P>Let us then &s;uppo&s;e, that this celebrated Diviner, by who&s;e Inchantments the <HI>Moabites,</HI> and their Confederates, expected to prove more fatal to the <HI>I&s;raeliti&s;h</HI> Ho&s;t, than all their united Force and Valour could be, is now in full March, at the Head of a nu|merous Train of Noblemen, and in full Scent of Honour and Pre&s;erment; when, on the &s;udden, and contrary to its u&s;ual Cu&s;|tom, his Bea&s;t makes a full Stop, without any vi&s;ible Hindrance, and will not be &s;et forward again, but by dint of dry Blows: They come next to a narrow Path, or De|file; where, after a fre&s;h Stop, and a &s;econd Drubbing, they &s;ee the fearful Bea&s;t &s;queeze it&s;elf quite clo&s;e to the Wall, to avoid &s;ome|thing in its Way, which neither he nor his
<PB N="168" REF="198">
Company can perceive; and in doing which, it is forced to cru&s;h its Rider's Foot again&s;t the Wall. This could not but be &s;omewhat &s;ur|pri&s;ing to them; but &s;till more &s;o, when, after &s;ome Miles riding, they come into a &s;treight Path, where they &s;ee the frighted Bea&s;t, in&s;tead of going forward, crouch &s;uddenly on its Belly; becau&s;e it &s;aw no Way to &s;lide by the unper|ceived Oppo&s;er, and continue a while motion|le&s;s, under a third, and more &s;evere, Volley of Blows. All this could not fail of drawing the Attention, as well as Wonder, of the whole Caravan: But whil&s;t they are ponder|ing on the Strangene&s;s of the Adventure, a new Scene offers it&s;elf; in which tho' the Prophet had the large&s;t Share of the Surprize, yet it could not but fill the re&s;t of the Com|pany with fre&s;h A&s;toni&s;hment. For here, on the &s;udden, the dumb Bea&s;t's Mouth is un|expectedly opened; not in its u&s;ual braying Tone, but in &s;uch a manner, that the Rider feels him&s;elf &s;everely reproved for his ill|timed Severity; but whether in &s;uch articu|late Words as were under&s;tood by the re&s;t, or only by the Prophet, I &s;hall not pre&s;ume to determine; tho' there is no Doubt but they under&s;tood the pa&s;&s;ionate Reply which he made

Whil&s;t they &s;tand in this Su&s;pen&s;e, they &s;ee the latter fall pro&s;trate on his Face before the Angel, and making his Apology to him for what he had ignorantly done, and offering to return to his own Home, &s;ince God &s;eemed now &s;o di&s;plea&s;ed with his Journey to the Land of <HI>Moab</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><HI>Num. ub. &s;up.

I will not pretend to decide, whether the Me&s;&s;en|gers of <HI>Balak,</HI> who were pre&s;ent at this ex|traordinary Scene, did &s;ee the Angel, or heard what he &s;aid to the Prophet, becau&s;e the Text hints nothing of it; but as they could not but hear what he &s;aid to the heavenly Me&s;&s;enger, and admire his humble Behaviour to him, they mu&s;t of cour&s;e &s;uppo&s;e, that there mu&s;t be &s;omething more than natural, that had thus &s;tayed the A&s;s in its Way, and now at la&s;t extorted &s;uch Language and De|portment from its Rider; for hitherto he had
<PB N="170" REF="200">
betrayed &s;uch uncommon Eagerne&s;s to go with them, and &s;atisfy their De&s;ires, in hopes of the large Rewards promi&s;ed to him, that he could not forbear expre&s;&s;ing an indecent Re&s;entment again&s;t the Bea&s;t, for &s;eeming to oppo&s;e or retard his Speed; whereas, after the &s;eeing of this unexpected Vi&s;ion, he ap|pears altogether di&s;couraged, and ready to de|&s;i&s;t, and give up all further Hopes of Prefer|ment. And as this Rencounter made him &s;o &s;trangely alter his Behaviour, and ca&s;t &s;uch a Damp upon his &s;anguine Views; &s;o I doubt not, but in the Account he gave them of it, as they went on, it produced a different Kind of Di&s;cour&s;e with them, and &s;uch as would prove a proper Preface to the Di&s;appointment they were like to meet with. For it is plain, from the &s;trict Charge which the Angel gave him, <HI>of &s;peaking only what God &s;hould dictate to him</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><HI>Num. ub. &s;up.

And ac|cordingly, upon his fir&s;t Approach to the <HI>Moabiti&s;h</HI> King, he prepares him in the &s;ame Way, by telling him, that, now he was

And it is hardly to be doubted, but his Me&s;&s;engers took al&s;o Care to inform him of all that had pa&s;&s;ed in their Journey homewards; particularly, the Rencounter with the Angel, and the Ad|venture of the A&s;s: From both which they might find Occa&s;ion to infer a Likelihoood, that their De&s;igns again&s;t <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were going to be defeated by a &s;uperior Power; and might be more upon their Guard to examine every Circum&s;tance, to prevent their being impo&s;ed upon by the Per&s;on who was pitched upon to be the chief Actor in it. For hither|to I &s;ee no Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect him of any Cheat; becau&s;e, tho' he might be ea&s;ily &s;up|po&s;ed to have contrived that &s;urpri&s;ing Scene, and pretended an extraordinary Vi&s;ion, in order to cover his Want of Power or Skill, or to avoid <HI>Balak</HI>'s Re&s;entment; yet how could he ever manage his dull Bea&s;t &s;o art|fully, as make it contribute its Part in, and to act it with the &s;ame Exactne&s;s as he did his own, without being perceived by &s;ome
<PB N="172" REF="202">
of the By-&s;tanders? How could he make it &s;tand &s;tock &s;till in one Place, &s;queeze it&s;elf again&s;t a Wall in another, to avoid &s;omething which neither he nor they could &s;ee; and in the third to crouch at once on its Belly; and in all three of them to continue motionle&s;s, under &s;uch a Volley of dry Blows, and e&s;cape the Notice of &s;ome or other of his numerous Retinue? But I &s;hall &s;ufficiently &s;hew, by-and-by, how incon&s;i&s;tent his Deportment in the Land of <HI>Moab,</HI> the &s;ingular manner of his ble&s;&s;ing the <HI>I&s;raeliti&s;h</HI> Tribes, and the Na|ture and Extent of the Prophecy he uttered on that Occa&s;ion, is to &s;uch a Suppo&s;ition.

<PB N="173" REF="203">
been worthy of the Interpo&s;ition of &s;uch an heavenly Me&s;&s;enger.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t, the Impo&s;&s;ibility of an A&s;s's <HI>a&s;&s;uming</HI> (he &s;hould have &s;aid rather, being miraculou&s;ly endowed with) an human Voice, and rational Faculty, it will be time enough to an&s;wer it, when he hath proved that pretended Impo&s;&s;ibility of all Miracles, of which this is allowed to be one; and that no more again&s;t Nature, or above the Power of an almighty Agent, than any of tho&s;e that were wrought in <HI>Egypt,</HI> or at the <HI>Red Sea;</HI> and for which I &s;hall refer him to what hath been &s;aid upon that Subject in the la&s;t E&s;&s;ay<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><HI>See before, p.</HI> 33, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI></NOTE>, and more particularly again&s;t the pretended Impo&s;&s;ibility of all Miracles in general<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid. p.</HI> 29, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI> 39, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI></NOTE>. For if it be once allowed that God hath &s;till re&s;erved to him&s;elf the Power, for &s;ome wi&s;e and important Ends, to di&s;|pen&s;e with his own Laws (and his bare De|nial of it, again&s;t all Rea&s;on, and the Sen&s;e of all Nations, is no Proof, that he hath not or cannot do &s;o), how will he make it ap|pear, that it is more above the Power of an

almighty Being, to enable a dumb Animal to pronounce &s;ome few articulate Words, in a rational Order, than to cleave the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> to rain down Manna &s;ix Days, and with-hold it on the &s;eventh, or to cure the deadly Sting of fiery Serpents by the bare looking on an artificial brazen one? And if it be farther objected, that the dumb Bea&s;t &s;hewed a greater Degree of Wi&s;dom than the Prophet that rode it, where even then will be the Won|der, if we con&s;ider who in&s;pired it? And if &s;ome of the Brute Creation do, in many Ca&s;es, di&s;play a greater Sagacity in their Actions than tho&s;e of the human Species, who value them&s;elves &s;o much on their &s;uperior Facul|ties; need we be &s;urpri&s;ed here, that the mo&s;t &s;tupid of all Animals, being, on &s;uch a particular Occa&s;ion as this, endowed with a much higher Degree of Rationability, which is the utmo&s;t Extent that can be allowed to the Miracle, &s;hould argue more ju&s;tly than its Ma&s;ter, who&s;e Judgment was hurried away by the Torrent of his boundle&s;s Am|bition, and the Pro&s;pect of &s;ome con&s;iderable Advancement? If any thing &s;eems to chal|lenge our Admiration on this Occa&s;ion, it mu&s;t be, one would think, the Method which
<PB N="175" REF="205">
the Divine Providence made choice of to ex|po&s;e the Stupidity of the Prophet<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Pet.</HI> ii. 16.</NOTE>; and to deter both him, and tho&s;e who &s;ent for him, from pur&s;uing their malevolent Views again&s;t the <HI>I&s;raelites;</HI> and his choo&s;ing rather by that means to forewarn them of the Dan|ger they would bring upon them, than to puni&s;h them for per&s;i&s;ting in them. He might as ea&s;ily have ordered the Angel to puni&s;h <HI>Balaam</HI> with immediate Death, as barely to ob&s;truct his Career; but if he pre|fers the &s;paring him, in order to make him a more effectual In&s;trument to convince both <HI>Moab</HI> and <HI>Midian,</HI> how vain and dangerous all their Efforts would prove, again&s;t a Peo|ple whom he had taken under his &s;pecial Conduct and Favour, why &s;hould the Singu|larity of the Miracle be deemed a &s;ufficient Proof again&s;t the Reality of it, when it is, in all other re&s;pects, &s;o agreeable to the di|vine Goodne&s;s?</P>
<P>I would farther ob&s;erve here, that the opening the Mouth of the dumb A&s;s could not but be a convincing Proof, both to <HI>Ba|laam,</HI>

ample Reward from him; and, on that ac|count, be the more profu&s;e in his Promi&s;es to him; as he could not but plainly &s;ee, that Avarice and Ambition were his predominant Pa&s;&s;ions. 2<HI>dly, Balaam</HI> had, by this time, beheld &s;o much of the Splendor of the <HI>Mo|abiti&s;h</HI> Court, and received &s;uch extraordinary Honours and Care&s;&s;es, both from that, and from the <HI>Midianiti&s;h</HI> Princes, as might ea&s;ily outbalance all other Con&s;iderations with him; and if he &s;till retained, as he could hardly do otherwi&s;e, any Fear of the Divine Di&s;plea&s;ure, it was now outweighed by a greater and more affecting one, to a Man of his Charac|ter; <HI>viz.</HI> that of forfeiting all tho&s;e Honours, and flattering Promi&s;es, and being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with Shame and Di&s;grace.

Nothing therefore could well be more aptly and con|de&s;cendingly calculated, than this real and twofold Miracle, to convince the &s;uper&s;titious <HI>Moabites,</HI> in their own Way, that if <HI>Balaam</HI> did, in the Sequel, thwart, in&s;tead of com|plying with, their Monarch's Reque&s;t, it was owing to the Divine Interpo&s;ition, which it was out of his Power to re&s;i&s;t; and, at the &s;ame time, nothing could be a properer De|terment to the Prophet, from cheri&s;hing his ambitious Views, than this miraculous Ren|counter, and the Angel's &s;evere Reproof and Interdiction. Again, when <HI>Balak</HI>'s pompous Promi&s;es to him had &s;o far obliterated tho&s;e

Impre&s;&s;ions, as to &s;et him upon the trying the Power of his Inchantments, in order to oblige that Monarch, he is foiled again and again in his Attempts; and forced, in &s;pite of his Heart, to pronounce the noble&s;t and mo&s;t endearing Ble&s;&s;ings on tho&s;e, on whom he was hired, and earne&s;tly wi&s;hed, to have poured the bittere&s;t Cur&s;es; whil&s;t <HI>Balak</HI> hath the &s;ingular Mortification to find every fre&s;h Trial he makes of his Art, to come out more irk&s;ome and di&s;couraging; till his Di&s;|dain and De&s;pair provoke him to di&s;mi&s;s him out of his Pre&s;ence and Territory. La&s;t|ly, <HI>Balaam,</HI> irritated at his Di&s;grace and Di&s;appointment, forgets all the former Warn|ings; and, in a Fit of Re&s;entment, devi&s;es that impious Stratagem, which he hopes will draw down that Cur&s;e upon <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> which his Inchantments could not effect; and, by his dreadful End, and the univer&s;al Slaughter of the <HI>Midianites,</HI> his infatuated Accomplices, God gives a fre&s;h and irrefragable Proof to <HI>Moab,</HI> and all the Kingdoms round about, of his unerring Providence, his Power, Ju&s;|tice, and Goodne&s;s, in defeating and puni&s;h|ing the impious Attempts of the Enemies of his cho&s;en People, and &s;paring the <HI>Moabiti&s;h</HI>

<P>I Do not at all wonder at the Difficulties which your incredulous Neighbours rai&s;e again&s;t the Probability of this remarkable Tran&s;action. The &s;wift and miraculous Suc|ce&s;s

which <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> and his <HI>Hebrew</HI> Ho&s;t, had &s;o lately met with, again&s;t the confe|derate Forces of the Southern <HI>Canaanites,</HI> by which he was become Ma&s;ter of all that large Tract of Ground, would, one might rea&s;onably think, have effectually deterred the&s;e Northern Kingdoms from the like hope|le&s;s and dangerous Attempt. How could they imagine it po&s;&s;ible for their Forces, how nu|merous and valiant &s;oever, to &s;top the <HI>Hebrew</HI> General's Career, whom they knew to have &s;top that of the two Luminaries, their two grand Deities, in the mid&s;t of theirs; and to have engaged the very Elements to over-whelm &s;o many Myriads of the flying Con|federates with Hail&s;tones; whil&s;t that Day was miraculou&s;ly lengthened, to give him Time to cut off their di&s;comfited Remains<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> x. <HI>pa&s;&s;.</HI></NOTE>? What Help could they hope for from their Deities, who had thus far already con|tributed to the utter Exci&s;ion of their South|ern Votaries, and &s;uffered the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> to de&s;troy all their Temples, Altars, and Images<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>See before, pag.</HI> 138, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI></NOTE>?

their whole Country to the irre&s;i&s;tible Force of &s;uch an Enemy, rather than ru&s;h into unavoidable De&s;truction, by attempting to oppo&s;e him?</P>
<P>This Difficulty, how great &s;oever it may appear, will quickly vani&s;h, if we con&s;ider, that the&s;e were, like the re&s;t, given up by God to a judicial Infatuation, and to a de|terminate Refu&s;al of all Offers of Peace, on the Conditions required of them<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> xi. 12. 19, 20. <HI>See before, p.</HI> 129, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI></NOTE>. Nor is it indeed to be much wondered at, that they &s;hould be &s;o unanimous in their Re&s;o|lution of dying Sword in Hand, in Defence of their Liberty, Religion, and Country; &s;ee|ing the &s;ame Spirit reigned almo&s;t every|where among tho&s;e Nations; and tho&s;e among them were held in the greate&s;t Con|tempt and Abhorrence, that preferred not Death, in &s;o intere&s;ting a Cau&s;e, to an igno|minious Servitude, on &s;uch di&s;honourable Terms, as they e&s;teemed the Exchange of their old idolatrous Wor&s;hip for that of the God of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> whom they looked upon, by this time, as an incen&s;ed and inexorable
<PB N="218" REF="248">
Judge, rather than as an Object worthy their Adoration and Love. In this de&s;perate Situa|tion, what could be expected from them, but that their Re&s;olutions &s;hould prove equally de&s;perate; and that they &s;hould try, by one bold Stroke of their united Force, either to &s;ave their All, or peri&s;h in the Attempt?</P>
<P>Accordingly we find, that whil&s;t <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> was refre&s;hing his Army, after his Conque&s;t of Southern <HI>Canaan,</HI> at his &s;tanding Camp at <HI>Gilgal,</HI> on the We&s;t Side of <HI>Jordan, Jabin,</HI> King of <HI>Hazor,</HI> one of the mo&s;t powerful of all the Northern Princes<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> xi. 10.</NOTE>, engaged not only &s;everal petty Kings, but a great Number of States, both on the Hills and Plains<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid.

<P>But here your Opponent rai&s;es a very con|&s;iderable Difficulty again&s;t the Po&s;&s;ibility of <HI>Jo&s;hua's</HI> (whom he &s;uppo&s;es to have been &s;till at his Camp at <HI>Gilgal)</HI> reaching them, in &s;o &s;hort a time, to the Place of their Rendez|vous
<PB N="221" REF="251">
at the Waters of <HI>Merom;</HI> which he likewi&s;e &s;uppo&s;es to be the <HI>Samachoniti&s;h</HI> Lake, &s;ituate about half-way between that of <HI>Ge|nezareth,</HI> and the Spring-head of the River <HI>Jordan.</HI> For, according to that twofold Sup|po&s;ition, he and his Army mu&s;t have marched at lea&s;t an hundred Miles, and a great Part of the Way over high Mountains, and narrow Defiles, in that &s;hort time; which is evi|dently impo&s;&s;ible. Your Friends may indeed wonder, that the &s;acred Hi&s;torian &s;hould have given us &s;o confu&s;ed and imperfect an Account of that &s;ignal Victory; e&s;pecially if <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> him&s;elf was, as he is &s;uppo&s;ed by mo&s;t Interpreters, the Penman of it; for, as he was &s;o con&s;ummate a General, it might be rea&s;onably expected, that he would have, if not embelli&s;hed his Relation, yet at lea&s;t been more particular in de&s;cribing the Circum|&s;tances both of his March, and of his en|gaging the Enemy. But they ought to have remembred, that it is the peculiar Character, I might have called it Excellency, of the &s;a|cred Hi&s;torians, to relate Facts with a &s;ur|pri&s;ing unaffected Simplicity; and, in all Actions of this Nature, to avoid, as much as po&s;&s;ible, entering into &s;uch Particulars, as
<PB N="222" REF="252">
relate to their own Prudence, Conduct, or Valour; le&s;t they &s;hould appear to a&s;&s;ume any Share of that Glory to them&s;elves, which was intirely due to their Heavenly Protector. Hence it is, that the in&s;pired Writer here thought fit to confine him&s;elf to the two mo&s;t material Points; <HI>viz.</HI> The Divine Pro|mi&s;e of a complete Victory over that nu|merous, and &s;o much dreaded, Ho&s;t; and the Event of it in their total Defeat. Other Circum&s;tances of that Battle might in|deed have convey'd to us a clearer Idea of the Conduct and Bravery of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Ge|neral, but could not have given us &s;o lively an one of the Di&s;play of the Divine Power, in favour of his People, as the repre&s;enting him here as the &s;ole Author of the whole Tran&s;action; and a&s;cribing the whole Glory of it, where it was mo&s;t ju&s;tly due.</P>
<P>However, as <HI>Gilgal,</HI> the &s;tanding Camp of the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> was at too great a Di&s;tance from the Waters of <HI>Merom,</HI> where the Confederate Forces were rendezvous'd, for <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> to reach it in &s;o &s;hort a time; whether we &s;uppo&s;e the latter to be the <HI>Samachoniti&s;h</HI> Lake, or,
<PB N="223" REF="253">
as I &s;hall &s;hew by-and-by, &s;ome Plain much nearer than the former; it were ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e the Divine Promi&s;e to have been made to him before his decamping from it, and not rather upon his being come within a &s;hort Day's March from, if not in full View of, the Enemy's Army. The Text &s;eems plainly to be in favour of this latter Suppo&s;i|tion; for <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> could hardly, before that time, be &s;o &s;ufficiently appri&s;ed of their Num|ber and Strength, as to want this fre&s;h A&s;|&s;urance from God: Neither will Rea&s;on permit us to think, that &s;o old and experi|enced a General would have &s;uffered &s;uch a grand Confederacy to be made again&s;t him, without u&s;ing all po&s;&s;ible Expedition to go and oppo&s;e them; e&s;pecially as &s;o great a Tract of South <HI>Canaan,</HI> which he had lately conquered, lay between him and them; and being now, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, de&s;titute of its old Inha|bitants, might have ea&s;ily become a Prey to them.</P>
<P>How long he and his Army were in marching from <HI>Gilgal</HI> to <HI>Merom,</HI> the Text doth not tell us: <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays only five

<P>What hath given Birth to that Mi&s;take is, that <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> mentions the City of <HI>Hazor,</HI>
<PB N="225" REF="255">
the Capital of <HI>Jabin,</HI> the chief of the confe|derate Kings, as &s;ituate upon that Lake; but, be&s;ides that he doth not hint any thing like the Battle having been fought there, is it not ve|ry ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;o politic a King, and who was the chief Promoter of the Con|federacy, &s;hould choo&s;e his own Territory to be the Scene of War; and a Plain, &s;o near his Metropolis; for the Field of Battle? Is it not much more rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that both he, and his Allies, would ha&s;te all they could, to meet the Enemy, before he could penetrate into any of their Territories? Hence it is generally concluded, that the <HI>Merom,</HI> here &s;poken of, is the &s;ame which <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> calls <HI>Merus,</HI> and places at about twelve Miles Di&s;tance from <HI>Seba&s;te,</HI> or <HI>Sama|ria,</HI> towards <HI>Dothaim,</HI> and on this Side of the Torrent of <HI>Ki&s;hon,</HI> and in the Neigh|bourhood of Mount <HI>Thabor,</HI> and the Waters of <HI>Megiddo,</HI> and the City of <HI>Thaanach:</HI> For upon that &s;ame Spot it was, that was after|wards fought the famous Battle between <HI>Si|&s;era,</HI> General of <HI>Jabin,</HI> King of <HI>Hazor,</HI> and <HI>Barak,</HI> the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Chief, about 150 Years after; in which the former, tho' va&s;tly &s;u|perior,
<PB N="226" REF="256">
was totally cut off<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><HI>Judg.</HI> iv. <HI>pa&s;&s;.</HI> v. 19.</NOTE>. For there was a very important Pa&s;s, which guarded the Entrance into <HI>Galilee,</HI> and &s;o into <HI>Phoenice;</HI> or from thence into South <HI>Canaan.</HI> It was therefore of the utmo&s;t Con&s;equence to the Confederates to &s;ecure it, &s;eeing the Lo&s;s of it would open, as it actually did, after their Defeat, a Way into all the Northern Part, which they inhabited, quite into upper <HI>Ga|lilee.</HI> Now this Spot being at mo&s;t but be|tween fifty or &s;ixty Miles from <HI>Gilgal,</HI> it was ea&s;y for <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> and his Army, to reach it in le&s;s than five Days, con&s;idering the ex|peditious Way which the <HI>Hebrews</HI> had of marching their Armies, not only in different Columns, more or le&s;s numerous, as the Ground would allow, but even in &s;mall Bo|dies, whenever they could do it &s;afe from the Attacks and In&s;ults of their Enemies; as they could, on this particular Occa&s;ion, through all the South Part of <HI>Canaan,</HI> where they had already de&s;troyed all that could po&s;&s;ibly an|noy them; and had, in all Probability, left here and there a Gari&s;on, at proper Places, to &s;ecure either their March, or a Retreat,
<PB N="227" REF="257">
in ca&s;e of Need. For it is to be ob&s;erved here, that they were encumbered with nei|ther Artillery nor Baggage, that could retard their Speed. They took nothing with them but their Arms, which were either the Sling.

But of this I &s;hall give as remarkable an In&s;tance, in the la&s;t of the&s;e E&s;&s;ays, as is to be met with in any Hi|&s;tory, either antient or modern. I mu&s;t &s;till add one peculiar Advantage they had, in this re&s;pect, above other Nations, from the ex|cellent Di&s;cipline e&s;tabli&s;hed among them by their in&s;pired Lawgiver, and improved by his worthy Succe&s;&s;or, the pre&s;ent <HI>Hebrew</HI> Chief, <HI>Jo&s;hua;</HI> and that was, that every Man that was able to bear Arms, that is, from twenty to &s;ixty Years of Age, was obliged to be in|rolled
<PB N="228" REF="258">
in the Mu&s;ter-Roll of his own Tribe, and to appear under the Standard of it, with his Provi&s;ions, and military Accoutrements, upon the fir&s;t Summons, under the &s;evere&s;t Penalties. The&s;e Mu&s;ter-Rolls were care|fully pre&s;erved, not only by every Tribe; but a general one of the Whole was likewi&s;e to be kept in the Hands of the chief Judge, or General. The former of tho&s;e Rolls was to be called over at the Head of each re&s;pective Tribe, to &s;ee that none were ab&s;ent, but &s;uch as were detained by &s;ome unavoidable Impediment, as Sickne&s;s, Lamene&s;s, and the like. Here, likewi&s;e, as many as had mar|ried a Wife, built a new Hou&s;e, planted a Vineyard, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> within the Year, having made good their Claim before the Head of the Tribe, were likewi&s;e di&s;mi&s;&s;ed to their own Home, and &s;et down as &s;uch in the Mu&s;ter-Book: After which the re&s;t were to march to the Place of Rendezvous, under their re&s;pective Heads of Thou&s;ands, Hun|dreds, and Fifties. Here their Names were called afre&s;h, to &s;ee whether any were mi&s;&s;|ing; and then the whole Amount was given to the head Commander. So that there could hardly be any that dared de&s;ert from his
<PB N="229" REF="259">
Colours, becau&s;e they knew not whither to go without Danger, no other Tribe daring to admit them within their Roll; and they being branded in their own for Run-aways, and liable to be puni&s;hed with Death, as &s;oon as found. They had &s;till another pow|erful Tie; <HI>viz.</HI> their Family: For all the Men were obliged to marry &s;oon after they had attained to their twentieth Year, and were generally fruitful. But in ca&s;e of De|&s;ertion, &s;hould they by good Chance have e&s;caped from being taken, yet they mu&s;t be for ever bani&s;hed from their Parents, Wives, and Children; be&s;ides living, perhaps, un|der &s;ome Servitude, in a &s;trange Place, and in con&s;tant Fear of being di&s;covered. To have fled into an Enemy's Country for Safe|ty, was not only equally dangerous, but much more dreaded; becau&s;e that re&s;cinded them from the Commonwealth of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> as Trai|tors and Apo&s;tates; which was e&s;teemed the greate&s;t Cur&s;e that could befal them. Upon all the&s;e Accounts, De&s;ertion was &s;o rare, that they could tru&s;t their Men to march through their own Country, without that mi|litary Regularity, which was commonly ob|&s;erved by other Nations; and, on all Emer|gencies

that required a more than ordinary Expedition, permit them to divide them&s;elves into &s;mall Bodies, go over Mountains, or fetch a Compa&s;s about, or take any other Method, that would bring them &s;oone&s;t to the Place of Rendezvous. It was, therefore, by this excellent Di&s;cipline, that the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Armies, tho' &s;ometimes very numerous, were able to make &s;uch &s;urpri&s;ing quick Marches, either over Mountains and Defiles, or by fetching a Compa&s;s about, as to come upon their Enemies, when they lea&s;t dreamed of their being &s;o nigh; and by attacking them on the &s;udden, on two, or three, &s;ometimes on all, Sides, in di&s;tinct Bodies, to give them a total Overthrow. Upon the Whole then, though <HI>Gilgal</HI> was at lea&s;t an hundred Miles Di&s;tance from <HI>Hazor,</HI> the Capital of the chiefe&s;t of the confederate Kings; yet the Text tells us, that when the&s;e la&s;t were a&s;|&s;embled together, they marched their Army to the Waters of <HI>Merom,</HI> in order to engage the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> xi. 5.</NOTE>; which, as I have &s;hewed before, were not tho&s;e of the Lake <HI>Samachon,</HI> as your Friend and others &s;uppo&s;e, but of

But, allowing that, it will not follow, that the Battle was fought near that Lake; but that <HI>Jabin,</HI> King of <HI>Hazor,</HI> prevailed on all the Nations, from the <HI>Hittites</HI> that lived un|der that Mount, and con|&s;equently were &s;ituate the farthe&s;t North from South <HI>Canaan,</HI> quite down to tho&s;e who inhabited the South Parts, from the Lake <HI>Genezareth</HI> Ea&s;tward, to the Borders of <HI>Dor</HI> on the We&s;t, to join in the Con|federacy with him; that is, that he engaged all the Nations about him, quite to the very Borders of South <HI>Canaan,</HI> to engage in that War. In Revenge of which, <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> having totally defeated them, pur|&s;ued them to the further|mo&s;t Part of their re&s;pective Territories; that is, to <HI>Mizrephoth-majim</HI> We&s;t, to <HI>Zidon</HI> North, and to this <HI>Mizpeh</HI> under <HI>Her|mon</HI> Ea&s;tward: Which I gladly &s;ub&s;cribe to, be|cau&s;e the Text ob&s;erves, that after he had pur&s;ued them thus far North, he turned back, and took and burned the City of <HI>Hazor</HI><NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> xi. 10.</NOTE>. But this cannot af|fect what I have &s;aid, ei|ther of the Field of Battle, or of <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI>'s attacking the Enemy by di&s;tinct Bo|dies; but rather confirms it.</NOTE>. And accordingly we

find <HI>Zidon</HI> on the North of that River; and the <HI>Mizrephoth-majim,</HI> the other Place where <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> pur&s;ued them, may be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed to have lain We&s;tward towards the Sea.

<P>Here then we have the three Points to which he pur&s;ued them; <HI>viz.</HI> to <HI>Mizpeh,</HI> Ea&s;tward; to <HI>Zidon,</HI> Northward; and to <HI>Mizrephoth-majim,</HI> We&s;tward: For the South being already conquered, it is not to be &s;up|po&s;ed they would venture to flee to any Part of it. We may therefore rea&s;onably con|clude, that this was the Scene of that me|morable Action; and that it lay near the Confines of both: And I think it highly pro|bable, that the River <HI>Ki&s;hon</HI> did, at this time, divide the Southern <HI>Canaan,</HI> conquered by <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> from the Northern, &s;till un&s;ub|dued; and hither it was that the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Chief led his Forces to oppo&s;e them<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> xi. 7.</NOTE>; and there it was that he gained the &s;ignal Victory, mentioned a little after, which enabled him, in four or five Years, to complete the Con|que&s;t of the whole Northern Tract<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid.

<P>There remains but one Difficulty unan|&s;wered; and that is, How <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> with his

&s;mall flying Army, for &s;uch it might ju&s;tly be deemed, in compari&s;on of that of the Confederates, could give them &s;uch a total Overthrow, and cha&s;e them &s;o many differ|ent Ways, and at &s;o great a Di&s;tance from each other; and cut them off, that none of them &s;hould remain, but tho&s;e few that fled into fortified Cities; burn all their warlike Chariots; ham&s;tring their Hor&s;es; and open to him&s;elf a Way thro' all that hilly Country, quite to the City of <HI>Hazor,</HI> which &s;tood above fifty Miles farther North; without meeting, that we read of, any farther Op|po&s;ition from the Enemy? But here likewi&s;e the &s;acred Hi&s;torian wholly a&s;cribes the Glo|ry of the whole Expedition to God, who de|livered up that numerous Ho&s;t into his Hand<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> xi. 8.</NOTE>; and leaves us to gue&s;s at the Methods which the <HI>Hebrew</HI> General took to accom|pli&s;h it, by &s;ome few Hints inter&s;per&s;ed, as it were accidentally, in the Text; but yet &s;ufficient to remove all Appearance of Im|probability in the Relation.</P>
<P>1<HI>&s;t,</HI> then, As to the prodigious Superiority of the Confederates, with re&s;pect to Num|ber,

it is univer&s;ally allowed to be a Di&s;|vantage, rather than Advantage; not only as it is apt to in&s;pire them with too much Confidence, Security, and Negligence; but likewi&s;e, as it often proves an unwieldy and dead Weight; e&s;pecially when engaged again&s;t a General, who knows how to choo&s;e his Ground, &s;o as to render the greater Part of it u&s;ele&s;s; for the Truth of which we need not &s;eek for a more pregnant In&s;tance, than in the two Armies of <HI>Darius</HI> and <HI>Alexander the Great.</HI> 2<HI>dly,</HI> By the Hint the Text gives us, of <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI>'s pur&s;uing the flying Ene|my, quite to <HI>Great Zidon,</HI> to <HI>Mizrephoth|majim,</HI> and to the Valley of <HI>Mizpeh;</HI> and &s;miting them, till none remained; that is, as the Text plainly imports, till none remained undi&s;per&s;ed; we may draw this very proba|ble Inference from it; <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> had divided his Army into &s;everal di&s;tinct Bodies, both to attack them on different Sides, and to pur&s;ue and kill tho&s;e that fled: For that was a Method much in vogue in tho&s;e antient times, &s;eeing we find it practi&s;ed as early as the time of <HI>Abraham</HI><NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gene&s;is</HI> xiv. 15.</NOTE>. Another Remark
<PB N="236" REF="266">
I would make on tho&s;e flying and &s;eparate Bodies, is, that they generally aimed at, and were de&s;igned to &s;urpri&s;e, the Enemy, and fall unexpectedly upon them on as many Sides as they could; by which means &s;uch a &s;udden Panic was generally convey'd from the Out-guards to the main Body of the Army, as &s;eldom failed of being attended with their total Overthrow. The many In|&s;tances of this kind of &s;ucce&s;sful Stratagems, in <HI>Barak, Gideon, Saul,</HI> and other <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Chiefs; and among the <HI>Maccabees,</HI> in later Ages; are not only &s;tanding Proofs of its U&s;e and Excellence, but give us a moral A&s;|&s;urance, that <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> who was &s;o well ver&s;ed in all the Arts of War, would not omit put|ting this in Practice, whenever a fair Oppor|tunity offered. And where can the Impro|bability be, that &s;uch a va&s;t Army as that of the Confederates, who, in all Likelihood, lay negligently encamped, tru&s;ting chiefly in their Number and Strength, &s;hould afford him &s;uch an one as he could wi&s;h; e&s;pecially if he took the Opportunity of coming upon them in the Night, and attacking them upon the fir&s;t Dawn of the Day? Did not <HI>Gideon,</HI> with his three hundred Men, by much the &s;ame
<PB N="237" REF="267">

Did not <HI>Barak,</HI> with 30,000 Men, defeat <HI>Si&s;era,</HI> and his numerous Ho&s;t, with his 900 Iron Chariots of War<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid.</HI> iv. <HI>pa&s;&s;.</HI></NOTE>? And <HI>Saul,</HI> with an Army of 300,000 Men, &s;ur|pri&s;e the <HI>Ammoniti&s;h</HI> Camp before <HI>Jabe&s;h-Gilead,</HI> and cut them all in Pieces<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xi. <HI>pa&s;&s;.</HI></NOTE>?

For, in the general Confu&s;ion and Mi&s;tru&s;t that reigned through tho&s;e numerous Ho&s;ts, which was &s;till much greater, when they con&s;i&s;ted of various Na|tions, whether Confederates or Auxiliaries, they commonly fell foul upon one another, with &s;uch de&s;perate Fury, that the Enemy had little el&s;e to do, but to &s;tand &s;till and &s;ee them &s;heath their Weapons into each other's

Side. How much more grievous mu&s;t the Horror and De&s;pair of the&s;e Northern <HI>Ca|naanites</HI> be, at this unhappy Juncture, to &s;ee them&s;elves &s;urpri&s;ed, and on all Sides &s;ur|rounded with &s;uch an irre&s;i&s;tible Enemy; all the Union of their Confederacy at once broken; their Politics defeated; and their united Force di&s;&s;olved; by the univer&s;al Di&s;|tru&s;t and Dread which reigns among them; whil&s;t every Nation, I might almo&s;t &s;ay eve|ry Individual, forgetting the Ties of com|mon Alliance, can think on nothing but of &s;eeking their own Safety, by the mo&s;t dan|gerous and de&s;perate means? Such, I believe, will ea&s;ily be allowed to be the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence of &s;uch ill-concerted Confedera|cies, when acting in Oppo&s;ition to a Force, which, how inferior &s;oever in Number, is &s;o &s;trongly cemented by one common Intere&s;t; directed by a wi&s;e and experienced Command|er; kept up by a good martial Di&s;cipline; and in&s;pirited with &s;uch frequent Divine A&s;&s;ure|ances of Victory. What Wonder is there then, that the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Army, with &s;o many great Advantages, nay, with every Advan|tage but that of Numbers, if that be really one, &s;hould thus totally rout and di&s;per&s;e that
<PB N="239" REF="269">
of &s;o many ill-united and intimidated Con&s;e|derates; make &s;uch a dreadful Slaughter among them that fled; pur&s;ue them to the very farthermo&s;t Borders of their re&s;pective Territories; and, in their Return, make them|&s;elves Ma&s;ters of every Part of that Northern Tract? But we may further remember, that immediately after their &s;ignal Defeat, <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> cutting off all the Men that he could come at, ham&s;tringing all their Hor&s;es, and de&s;troy|ing all their Chariots, in which it is likely their chief Strength con&s;i&s;ted, put it wholly out of their Power to make any farther De|fence again&s;t him.</P>
<P>The only Difficulty that can be &s;tarted, therefore, again&s;t this &s;ignal Tran&s;action, is, that &s;uch a numerous Ho&s;t, as that of the Confederates, who had with them &s;uch Mul|titudes of Hor&s;e, and warlike Chariots, and could &s;end Scouts enough abroad, to give them Intelligence of what pa&s;&s;ed, &s;hould &s;uf|fer them&s;elves to be &s;urpri&s;ed by the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Chief; and, what is more amazing, by an old threadbare Stratagem, that had been in U&s;e even &s;ince <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Days; and had been &s;o lately practi&s;ed with Succe&s;s by him
<PB N="240" REF="270">
in the Relief of <HI>Gibeon,</HI> and the Defeat of the confederate Army of <HI>Canaanites,</HI> that were then be&s;ieging it on all Sides. Was not all this enough to put them upon keeping a bet|ter Guard around them than u&s;ual, to avoid the like Surprize? To this I an&s;wer, That nothing is more common, than for &s;uch large Armies to tru&s;t &s;o far to their Numbers, Strength, advantageous Situation, and the For|tifications of their Camp, as to become quite negligent of this main Point. We meet with numberle&s;s In&s;tances of this, both in &s;acred and profane Hi&s;tory; and &s;ome of them of a much more modern Date. The&s;e Confe|derates, having formed their &s;everal Camps in the propere&s;t manner, and, as is mo&s;t likely, &s;urrounded them with their armed Chariots, perhaps two or three Rows deep, and po&s;ted their Vanguards about them, might think them&s;elves &s;ufficiently &s;ecured from any &s;udden Attack, without troubling them&s;elves about any further Precautions. This was the Ca&s;e, we find, above 200 Years after, of the confederate <HI>Midianites, Amalek|ites,</HI> and their Ea&s;tern Allies; whom the &s;acred Hi&s;torian repre&s;ents as lying negligent|ly &s;cattered about like Locu&s;ts, when <HI>Gideon</HI>
<PB N="241" REF="271">
fell &s;uddenly upon them, in the Night, and gave them &s;uch a total Overthrow, that they dared not &s;hew their Faces again&s;t <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> for &s;ome Scores of Years after<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><HI>Judg.</HI> vii. 12, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI></NOTE>. I have alrea|dy mentioned other In&s;tances out of the &s;a|cred Books, and could produce a much greater out of profane Hi&s;torians, were it needful.</P>
<P>But, 2<HI>dly, Jo&s;hua,</HI> who was become Ma|&s;ter of all South <HI>Canaan,</HI> might ea&s;ily put it out of the Power of the Enemy to receive any Intelligence of his Approach, by cau&s;ing all the Pa&s;&s;es and Defiles to be clo&s;ely guard|ed. For, as I ob&s;erved before, the Battle was fought near the Frontiers, between North and South <HI>Canaan;</HI> though on which Side I will not pretend to affirm. It was ea&s;y there|fore to prevent their Scouts, or even any of his De&s;erters, if any &s;uch there had been, to bring them Notice of his March or Route: So that hearing nothing from any Side, they might ea&s;ily imagine that he dared not come to attack them.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="272">
3<HI>dly,</HI> I likewi&s;e ob&s;erved, that he u&s;ually marched his Army in different Columns; and that not only for the &s;ake of Expedition, but likewi&s;e that he might attack the Enemy on different Sides. It was ea&s;y therefore for him to order one Corps to march towards them, by the neare&s;t Way, but &s;omewhat more &s;lowly; whil&s;t he ordered the re&s;t of his Army to fetch a Compa&s;s about, both on the Right and Left; and, by a &s;peedier March, to arrive time enough to fall unex|pectedly upon them, on the Flank or Rear, whil&s;t the&s;e attacked them in Front; which could not fail of throwing them into Di&s;order and Confu&s;ion. Let me add, that &s;uppo&s;ing their Camp ever &s;o well fortified, <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> had &s;till another Stratagem to play again&s;t them, as he had lately done to the Inhabitants of <HI>Ai</HI><NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> viii. 3, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI></NOTE>; <HI>viz.</HI> by making a feint Attack with one Body, in order to draw them out of their Intrenchments, in Pur&s;uit of them; and then falling &s;uddenly upon them, on the Flank and Rear.</P>
<P>By all therefore that hath been &s;aid upon this memorable Tran&s;action, you may plain|ly
<PB N="243" REF="273">
&s;ee, that there was nothing done in it, but what might have been performed by any other experienced Chief, in the common martial Way of Conque&s;t; tho' he had never been favoured with &s;uch Encouragements, and A&s;&s;urances of Succe&s;s, as God was plea&s;ed &s;o frequently to give to <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> and his Troops. It is therefore no Wonder, that the &s;acred Writers, in&s;tead of dwelling on a long De|tail of the Arts and Stratagems that were u&s;ed by the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Chiefs, choo&s;e rather to a&s;cribe the whole Glory of all their &s;ignal Vic|tories, and the happy Con&s;equences of them, to the Divine Providence, that &s;o vi&s;ibly pro&s;pered their Arms; &s;ince it was chiefly owing to their &s;ure Tru&s;t and Confidence in tho&s;e repeated A&s;&s;urances, that they fought &s;o valiantly and &s;ucce&s;sfully again&s;t Enemies that wholly relied on their Number and Strength, and on the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of their ima|ginary Deities; and who, by their dete&s;table Wor&s;hip of them, had not only forfeited all Title to the Protection of God, but had made them&s;elves worthy of his mo&s;t &s;evere Puni&s;h|ments. Neverthele&s;s it would be ab&s;urd to infer from thence, that <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> neglected any

Art or Stratagem, that could either &s;ecure or facilitate the promi&s;ed Conque&s;t; for that were an Abu&s;e of, rather than a Reliance on, the Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and &s;uch as we have no Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect him to have been capa|ble of. If therefore tho&s;e Arts and Means are not recorded in the Text, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to be done with any other View, than to intimate to us the &s;mall Efficacy they mu&s;t all have had, without &s;uch a &s;teady Reliance on the one Side, and God's Ble&s;&s;ing on the other; than which nothing could be more proper to keep up their Confidence in him, and to fill them with the mo&s;t grateful Sen&s;e, for all the Succe&s;s they had hitherto, or &s;hould hereafter be ble&s;&s;ed with; whil&s;t, on the other hand, in&s;tead of arrogating any Share of the Glory of it, they looked upon them&s;elves only as the mere In&s;truments of his Providence, and Executors of his Divine Will.

without Artifice or Stratagem, we need not wonder &s;o much, that his unbounded Am|bition, of being thought the invincible Son of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> did not permit him to de&s;cend to &s;uch low and derogatory Arts; but how he would have acted again&s;t more warlike Nations, may be ea&s;ily gue&s;&s;ed at, &s;eeing all his Acti|ons, that one Ca&s;e excepted, were but one continued Series of the mo&s;t deeply concerted Arts and Stratagems again&s;t the Liberties and Properties of &s;o many Nations, over which he had neither Title nor Claim; and that frequently at the Expence of his own faithful <HI>Macedonian</HI> Troops, who&s;e Lives he was ju&s;tly blamed for being as lavi&s;h of, as our <HI>Hebrew</HI> Heroes were careful to pre|&s;erve tho&s;e of their own.

<PB N="258" REF="288">
which he relates a Fact &s;o little to the Cre|dit of his Nation.</P>
<P>The main Difficulty therefore which you are concerned to remove, with re&s;pect to the bloody War of the eleven Tribes again&s;t that of <HI>Benjamin,</HI> is neither the unnatural Beha|viour of the <HI>Gibeathites</HI> to the <HI>Levite,</HI> and his Concubine; nor that of that whole Tribe, in refu&s;ing to &s;urrender tho&s;e bruti&s;h Wretches to condign Puni&s;hment: For how &s;trange &s;oever either of them may appear, yet is there nothing in it either improbable, or in|con&s;i&s;tent with the Degeneracy of tho&s;e times, and the Character of that haughty and un|tractable Tribe. Neither will there any thing appear extraordinary in that laudable Zeal, which the other Tribes &s;o unanimou&s;ly ex|pre&s;&s;ed on this Occa&s;ion; nor in the Re&s;o|lution they took of puni&s;hing tho&s;e Mi&s;|creants with the utmo&s;t Severity; when we call to mind how expre&s;ly this had been commanded them by God, to the utter Ex|tirpation of tho&s;e that &s;hould be found guilty of &s;uch vile Abominations<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vid. Deut.</HI> xiii. 12, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI> xxiii. 17. <HI>Levit.</HI> xviii. 22. xx. 13. <HI>&amp; alib. pa&s;&s;.</HI></NOTE>. And it was
<PB N="259" REF="289">
on account of that, among many other cry|ing Sins, that the <HI>Canaanites</HI> were doomed to utter De&s;truction; which Puni&s;hment was no le&s;s &s;everely denounced again&s;t the <HI>I&s;rael|ites,</HI> that &s;hould be found guilty of them. It would have, indeed, been more &s;urpri&s;ing, if, in a Ca&s;e of this Nature, they had ex|pre&s;&s;ed le&s;s Warmth and Abhorrence than they did, not only again&s;t the bruti&s;h Perpe|trators of that unnatural Deed, but much more again&s;t the more wicked <HI>Benjamites,</HI> for patronizing it, in&s;tead of &s;hewing them|&s;elves the mo&s;t forward in puni&s;hing it.</P>
<P>The chief Difficulty therefore remaining, that is really &s;uch, and that no &s;mall one in your Opponent's Eye, lieth in accounting for the ill Succe&s;s that attended the laudable Re|&s;olution of the eleven Tribes, and for their being &s;o &s;hamefully repul&s;ed, and with &s;o con|&s;iderable a Lo&s;s; e&s;pecially after having con|&s;ulted the Divine Oracle about this War, and received &s;uch an encouraging An&s;wer from it, as could hardly be interpreted to import le&s;s than a Promi&s;e of a complete Victory, as a due Reward for their Zeal: Whil&s;t, to their great Mortification and A&s;toni&s;hment, they
<PB N="260" REF="290">
&s;ee the Arms of that impious and untracta|ble Tribe crowned with an unde&s;erved Vic|tory. The&s;e are the &s;trong Terms in which your Opponent couches his Objection: In which, however, he &s;eems to overlook two material Points, ami&s;s, in their Behaviour, on this important and extraordinary Occa&s;ion; namely, 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> However laudable and conform|able to the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Law their Intention might be, to puni&s;h the impious <HI>Gibeathites</HI> with the utmo&s;t Severity; yet this &s;udden and una|nimous Re&s;olution, of declaring an offen&s;ive War again&s;t the whole Tribe of <HI>Benjamin,</HI> appears plainly enough, by all Circum&s;tances, to have been the Effect of their Re&s;entment again&s;t it, for daring to oppo&s;e them&s;elves, in Defence of &s;uch Mi&s;creants, again&s;t the whole <HI>I&s;raeliti&s;h</HI> Congregation, rather than the Re&s;ult of a cool, &s;incere, and deliberate Debate, about the mo&s;t effectual Means to extirpate &s;uch &s;hameful Impieties out of their Commonwealth. Had they given them&s;elves time to think coolly upon it, they mu&s;t have remembred, that if it was not permitted to them to declare War, even again&s;t Strangers, without con&s;ulting the Di|vine Oracle, that is, the High-Prie&s;t, by

<HI>Urim;</HI> much le&s;s was it for them, not only to re&s;olve, but to bind them&s;elves by a &s;o|lemn Oath, to engage in one again&s;t one of their own Tribes; and to pur&s;ue it with &s;uch furious Zeal. For it is plain, however your Antagoni&s;t may have overlooked it, that they never once thought of con&s;ulting the Divine Will, or, as the in&s;pired Writers commonly word it, of <HI>inquiring of,</HI> or <HI>a&s;king Coun&s;el of, the LORD,</HI> till the War was unani|mou&s;ly re&s;olved upon, and &s;worn to. And then it was not to inquire about the Fitne&s;s or Lawfulne&s;s of it, for that they took for granted; but only which Tribe &s;hould have the Po&s;t of Honour, and the chief Com|mand, in this ho&s;tile Expedition; that no Jarring or Di&s;pute about it might ob&s;truct the Execution or Succe&s;s of it. The other Circum&s;tance which your Opponent hath overlooked, is, that the Divine Oracle, or, as is commonly under&s;tood, the An&s;wer of the High-Prie&s;t by <HI>Urim,</HI> only informs them, that the Preference inquired after is due to the Tribe of <HI>Judah.</HI> But this An&s;wer was not attended with any Promi&s;e of Succe&s;s<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><HI>Judg.</HI> xx. 18, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI></NOTE>,
<PB N="262" REF="292">
which was rather expected by them as a thing of cour&s;e, or as the natural Con&s;equence of &s;o picus and laudable an Enterprize.

In this Per&s;ua&s;ion and Confidence, they never inquire whether God will ble&s;s them with one, but only a&s;k who &s;hall lead them to it: And this it was that proved the Cau&s;e of their fir&s;t Defeat; and that ju&s;tly too, as a con|dign Puni&s;hment for their Pre&s;umption, in ra&s;hly decreeing the Exci&s;ion of a Tribe, without either con&s;ulting God's Will about it, or trying &s;ome previous Method of re|ducing them to Rea&s;on, by more pacific means: For this was, in Fact, making them|&s;elves Judges and Executioners in God's Cau&s;e, without his Authority, Advice, or Con&s;ent. To this I may add, what the <HI>Jews</HI> farther allege again&s;t them, that they fought his Cau&s;e with unhallowed, or with Hands as guilty as tho&s;e of that rebellious Tribe; in &s;uffering a new Kind of Idolatry to be &s;et and kept up among&s;t them; if they were

how could they be more effectually brought to a ju&s;ter Way of Thinking, than by their being &s;uffered to meet with a &s;ignal Defeat, where they expected nothing le&s;s than a complete Victory?

all the Inquiry and Application which the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> &s;eem to have made upon this Oc|ca&s;ion; <HI>viz.</HI> They fir&s;t inquired of this grand Council, then &s;olemnly a&s;&s;embled, who &s;hould have the Command of the Army; and, upon their being unexpectedly defeated, they con&s;ulted them about the Lawfulne&s;s of the War, which they now began to fear was di&s;plea&s;ing to God; &s;ince they had &s;ucceeded no better on their fir&s;t On&s;et.

<P>But there was &s;till another, and more dan|gerous, Effect to be feared, from their too ra&s;h and precipitate Zeal again&s;t the <HI>Benja|mites,</HI> at fir&s;t; <HI>viz.</HI> the general and &s;olemn Cur&s;e they had pronounced again&s;t any one that &s;hould give his Daughter in Marriage to any of that rebellious Tribe, whil&s;t they had &s;uffered their furious Zeal to tran&s;port them &s;o far, as to de&s;troy all their Females; &s;o that the &s;paring of the&s;e 600 Men could be
<PB N="268" REF="298">
of little Service towards the &s;aving of that Tribe from peri&s;hing, unle&s;s they could al&s;o find them Wives, on whom to beget a new Offspring.

that Emergency. For we meet with &s;ome &s;uch In&s;tances in Scripture, in which God has thought fit to &s;u&s;pend his An&s;wer, when thus a&s;ked, in the u&s;ual Form; and upon perhaps a le&s;s provoking Occa&s;ion than this, as he did, &s;ome time after, to <HI>Saul,</HI> upon his Son <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s having incurred his Cur&s;e, by ta&s;ting of the forbidden Honey<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vid. int. al.</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xiv. 37.</NOTE>: And this, not &s;o much, in all Probability, to &s;hew his Di&s;plea&s;ure for a Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion unwittingly committed, as to in&s;pire the People with a deeper Sen&s;e of his all-&s;eeing Eye, who would not &s;uffer even &s;o &s;mall and incon&s;iderable a Fault to pa&s;s by uncen&s;ured.

<P>Had they taken this laudable Method, I doubt not but God would have either ab|&s;olved them from their Oath, or directed them to &s;ome means how to &s;upply the remaining 600 <HI>Benjamites</HI> with Wives, without the Breach of it; whether by di&s;pen&s;ing with the Obligation of marrying <HI>I&s;raeliti&s;h</HI> Wo|men; or permitting them to &s;eize on them by Force, and without their Parents Con&s;ent; or, la&s;tly, by naturalizing &s;uch a Number of their Virgin Slaves, as would have &s;ufficed

Men, Women, and Children, in order to &s;ave all the Virgins they found among&s;t them, and be&s;tow them upon the remaining 600 <HI>Benjamites.</HI> But the Number of them proving in&s;ufficient, they have recour&s;e to another Stratagem, equally elu&s;ory and &s;can|dalous; <HI>viz.</HI> permitting the other 200, that were &s;till unprovided for, to fall foul on a Company of Dam&s;els, coming down from <HI>Shiloh,</HI> the then Place of <HI>I&s;raeliti&s;h</HI> Wor&s;hip, and forcing them into Matrimony, without either their own, or their Parents, Con&s;ent. This Proceeding your Opponent ju&s;tly blames, as who doth not? but is unwilling to allow it, what it really appears to be, the Re&s;ult of a ra&s;h and precipitate Judgment, whether of the <HI>Sanhedrin,</HI> or only of the Heads of the Tribes, it matters not, &s;o long as it doth not appear from the Text, that the Pontiff was con&s;ulted about it, in the u&s;ual Form; or that it was in the lea&s;t approved, much le&s;s dictated, by the Divine Oracle, as your Op|ponent would willingly in&s;inuate. The very Words with which the in&s;pired Hi&s;torian concludes the Relation; <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>in tho&s;e Days there was no King in</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>but every one did what was right in his own Eyes;</HI> &s;uf|ficiently
<PB N="273" REF="303">
prove the contrary; and that their whole Proceeding &s;tands condemned by him, as di&s;plea&s;ing to the Divine Being. For it plainly intimates, that this Epoch, &s;hort as it proved, was a time of Anarchy and Con|fu&s;ion; wherein the People, for want of pro|per Governors to re&s;train them, had run them&s;elves into all kind of Licentiou&s;ne&s;s. The idolatrous Wor&s;hip &s;et up by the <HI>Dan|ites,</HI> in their new Settlement; the abomina|ble Attempt made by the <HI>Gibeathites,</HI> on the travelling <HI>Levite;</HI> the unnatural Abu&s;e of his Concubine; and the tumultuous War, with all its dire Effects that en&s;ued; are brought in as pregnant In&s;tances of the then reigning Corruption; and, being &s;o little to the Credit of the <HI>I&s;raeliti&s;h</HI> Nation, are no le&s;s manife&s;t Proofs of the Sincerity and Im|partiality of the in&s;pired Hi&s;torian. It is therefore in vain that your Antagoni&s;t pre|tends to offer &s;ome more rational Expedients, by which the &s;pilling of &s;o much Blood might have been prevented, in&s;tead of tho&s;e violent ones, into which the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> &s;uffer|ed them&s;elves to be hurried. Any Man of common Sen&s;e might do the &s;ame; and yet &s;o unhappy is he in his Choice of them, that
<PB N="274" REF="304">
the mo&s;t con&s;iderable one of all he propo&s;es; <HI>viz.</HI> that for the &s;aving the <HI>Gileadites</HI> from De&s;truction; can by no means be allowed of, as being altogether incon&s;i&s;tent with the Laws and martial Di&s;cipline of the <HI>I&s;raelites.</HI> He tells you very gravely, that the&s;e, in&s;tead of dooming the Inhabitants of <HI>Gilead</HI> to utter Exci&s;ion, ought only to have obliged them to give all their unmarried Females in Mar|riage to the 600 <HI>Benjamites;</HI> which they might the more lawfully have done, becau&s;e, as they did not appear in Arms at the Place of Rendezvous, they could not be affected by the general Oath which the re&s;t of the Tribes had &s;worn. But here he &s;hould have con&s;idered, that by their not an&s;wering the general Summons, they had, according to the martial Laws of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> forfeited their Lives, and incurred the Penalty of military Execu|tion, from which no Power could then ex|empt them; there being, at this Juncture, neither King nor Judge among them. And if he &s;ays, that the grand Council, or <HI>Sanhe|drin,</HI> could have di&s;pen&s;ed with the Severity of that Law; which, by-the-by, he will find an hard Matter to prove; yet it ought to be con&s;idered, how impolitic &s;uch a Step mu&s;t
<PB N="275" REF="305">
have been, and what an Encouragement it might have given to the re&s;t, to neglect the excellent Di&s;cipline which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> had left among&s;t them, and on which, con&s;i|dering, as I &s;hall &s;hew in my next, how they were &s;urrounded every-where with Enemies, be&s;ides tho&s;e which they were forced &s;till to entertain within their own Bowels, was the greate&s;t Security they could have again&s;t any Attempt, either from within, or from with|out<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><HI>See before, p.</HI> 227.</NOTE>, and a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on for their ob|&s;erving it with &s;uch Exactne&s;s and Severity.</P>
<P>I have, by this time, gone thro' every thing worth Notice in your Opponent's Let|ter, except the &s;mall Sting which he leaves at the Clo&s;e of it; but which neither carries Sharpne&s;s or Poi&s;on enough to fright one from handling it. He thinks it very &s;ur|pri&s;ing, on the one hand, that <HI>Phinehas,</HI> who, as High-Pontiff, &s;at at the Helm of, and &s;teered, the whole <HI>Sanhedrin,</HI> &s;hould yet be &s;o far wanting, either in Zeal, Courage, or Conduct, as not to make u&s;e of all his In|tere&s;t and Authority with them, to &s;uppre&s;s
<PB N="276" REF="306">
all tho&s;e &s;hameful Di&s;orders that then reign|ed in <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> and on the other, that if &s;uch was his Remi&s;&s;ne&s;s, or Want of Authority, upon &s;uch an Occa&s;ion, one would rea&s;ona|bly expect, that God &s;hould, as he has often done before and &s;ince, have interpo&s;ed his Divine Power, either to inflame his Zeal, or give a due Weight to his Authority, both over the grand Council, and over the re&s;t of the People.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t, I &s;hall only ob|&s;erve, that <HI>Phinehas</HI> wanted neither Zeal nor Courage in God's Cau&s;e: Had his Authority been equal to either, there could never &s;uch a general Apo&s;ta&s;y and Corruption have crept into the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Church and Commonwealth. A Per&s;on who had even dared to &s;top a ge|neral Defection of the whole Nation by the Death of the two chief Offenders, and tho&s;e of the highe&s;t Rank<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Num.</HI> xxv. 6.</NOTE>, cannot be ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;ed to have connived at this general Apo&s;ta&s;y, for want of Zeal or Courage, had he been &s;upported, as he ought, by the &s;e|cular Power. But the whole Tenor of the
<PB N="277" REF="307">
Book of <HI>Judges,</HI> and the frequent Apo&s;ta&s;ies that crept in again and again, after the Death of any of tho&s;e Chiefs, whom God &s;et up for Rulers and Deliverers of that rebellious Nation, is but too plain an Evidence of the little Influence which the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Pontiffs, and the <HI>Sanhedrin,</HI> had over them, when|ever there happened an Interregnum, or the Want of a &s;trenuous Judge, to give it a due Sanction.</P>
<P>But here, &s;ays your Opponent, the more vi&s;ible Need was there of the Divine Inter|po&s;ition, to give that Sanction to their di&s;|regarded Authority, in order to check that general Depravity. Before I an&s;wer this la&s;t Objection, give me Leave to ob&s;erve to you, and I would advi&s;e you to do the &s;ame to him, how widely and incon&s;i&s;tently Men in this Way of Thinking are apt to argue, as be&s;t &s;erves their Turn. At one time, you &s;hall hear them exclaim again&s;t the Probabi|lity of God's interpo&s;ing &s;o wonderfully, and &s;o frequently, in favour of &s;uch a poor in|con&s;iderable Nation; which, mo&s;t common|ly, were apt to repay his &s;ignal Favours with black Ingratitude, Murmurs, and downright

Apo&s;ta&s;y: At other times, as in the Ca&s;e before us, they will not &s;cruple to a&s;cribe all tho&s;e Di&s;orders and Corruptions to the Want of this extraordinary Interpo&s;ition. Sometimes the&s;e Divine Interpo&s;itions are arraigned, ei|ther as beneath the Dignity of the Supreme Being, or as an Infringement on the Liberty of rational Agents: And at other times, the Want of them is urged as an Argument again&s;t his Providence. So that, unle&s;s he will plea&s;e to rain or &s;hine, to act or not act, as they think proper, they will, at all Hazards, take the Liberty of cen&s;uring, or calling in que&s;ti|on, what the &s;acred Books relate of him.

<P>THE Occa&s;ion of this dreadful and un|u&s;ual Summons of the newly cho&s;en <HI>Hebrew</HI> Monarch, to the ten Tribes on this Side <HI>Jordan,</HI> you will find mentioned at the
<PB N="285" REF="315">
Beginning of the Chapter; where <HI>Naha&s;h,</HI> King of the <HI>Ammonites,</HI> a mo&s;t inveterate Enemy to <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> is related to have reduced the Inhabitants of <HI>Jabe&s;h-Gilead,</HI> on the other Side of that River, to &s;uch Streights, that they were upon the Point of buying their Lives at the Expence of a mo&s;t unworthy Slavery; and to &s;ubmit to the cruelle&s;t and mo&s;t igno|minious Conditions, of being deprived of their right Eyes, as an eternal Brand of In|famy to their whole Nation, and an effectual means of rendering them utterly u&s;ele&s;s in War, and incapable of regaining their Liber|ty. The Pretence for this unju&s;t and inhu|man Behaviour of the <HI>Ammoniti&s;h</HI> King, you may read in the tenth and following Chap|ter of the Book of <HI>Judges,</HI> where you will find the Ca&s;e between the two Nations fairly &s;tated, and the Ground of the Quarrel as fair|ly exploded, by the then valiant <HI>Hebrew</HI> Chief, <HI>Jephthah</HI> the <HI>Gileadite.</HI> But as his Rea&s;ons could not prevail upon them to re|cede, till he had forced them, by the com|plete Victory he &s;oon after gained over them; their Defeat had &s;o excited their Rage ever &s;ince, that they thought now no Revenge bloody enough for their Re&s;entment. And
<PB N="286" REF="316">
this it was that made their haughty Monarch to refu&s;e the <HI>Jabe&s;hites</HI> any other, than tho&s;e cruel and ignominious Terms you have heard. So that the mo&s;t that their Submi&s;&s;ion and Di&s;tre&s;s could obtain from him, was a poor Truce, or rather Reprieve, of &s;even Days; in which Space of Time if no Relief could be procured from the other ten Tribes, they agreed to &s;ubmit to their hard Fate. And it is in|deed a Wonder, that he, who breathed no|thing but Di&s;grace and Ruin again&s;t the <HI>I&s;|raelites,</HI> &s;hould yet yield to them this &s;hort Re&s;pite, and run the Ri&s;k of a Delay. But here the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Hi&s;torian tells us <HI>(Antiq.</HI> l. vi. c. 5.), that the Be&s;ieged had already &s;ent to implore the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the two Tribes and an half on their Side of <HI>Jordan;</HI> and that none of them dared to &s;tir an Hand to their Relief. So that there being &s;o little Likelihood, that the other ten on this Side, which were &s;till at a greater Di&s;tance, &s;hould be able to bring them any in &s;o &s;hort a time; he might, in that Confidence, ea&s;ily grant them that Breathing-time; unle&s;s we will rather &s;uppo&s;e, as mo&s;t likely, that the Divine Providence &s;o far re&s;trained his Re|&s;entment, in order to give the new <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI>
<PB N="287" REF="317">
Monarch an Opportunity of &s;ignalizing this Expedition, which was, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the fir&s;t E&s;&s;ay of his Government, with &s;uch an eminent Proof of his Fortitude and Con|duct; and to reward his Genero&s;ity with &s;uch &s;uitable Succe&s;s, as &s;hould in&s;pire his new Subjects with a greater Regard to, and Con|fidence in, him.</P>
<P>Accordingly the &s;acred Hi&s;torian tells us, that <HI>Saul,</HI> upon his Return from the Field, and receiving the fir&s;t News of the <HI>Jabe&s;hites</HI> extreme Di&s;tre&s;s, was in&s;pired with a more than human Courage; whil&s;t the re&s;t of the People could only expre&s;s their Concern, by their doleful Outcries: And that having, in a kind of enthu&s;ia&s;tic Fury, hewed a Yoke of Oxen into &s;mall Pieces, he di&s;patched them with all Speed, by proper Me&s;&s;engers, to all the Tribes, with the dreadful Threat mentioned in the Text, <HI>Who&s;oever cometh not forth after</HI> Saul <HI>and after</HI> Samuel, <HI>&s;o &s;hall it be done unto his Oxen,</HI> &amp;c. The Con&s;equence of which was, that the ten Tribes immedi|ately gathered them&s;elves with one Con&s;ent, or, as the Original elegantly expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>as one Man;</HI> and obeyed his Summons, with
<PB N="288" REF="318">
&s;uch &s;urpri&s;ing Readine&s;s and Speed, as to be able to join him, at the Time and Place ap|pointed by him for the general Rendezvous, tho' &s;ome of the Tribes were &s;eated at above an hundred Miles Di&s;tance from it, as will be &s;hewn to you in due time.</P>
<P>As I am called upon, by my Duty and Office, to &s;peak to you from this Place, on this ble&s;&s;ed Sabbath-day, you will have the le&s;s Cau&s;e to wonder at my choo&s;ing to en|tertain you, on this Occa&s;ion, with this no|ble and truly generous Expedition, of the new <HI>Hebrew</HI> Monarch; and to remind you of the &s;ingular Ble&s;&s;ing that attended it; if you will but &s;eriou&s;ly reflect, that you are now called upon, and commanded, by your King and Country, to an Enterprize no le&s;s glorious and pre&s;&s;ing, the re&s;cuing of a Mo|ther City of this Realm from falling into the Hands of a no le&s;s inveterate Enemy; and &s;ome Thou&s;ands of your brave Fellow-Subjects from the fatal and unavoidable Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of &s;acrificing their Lives, to avoid be|ing reduced to the lowe&s;t State of Slavery: And who&s;e Di&s;tre&s;s, and imminent Danger, though not perhaps quite &s;o urgent as that of
<PB N="289" REF="319">
the <HI>Jabe&s;hites</HI> in the Text, yet calls as loudly for all your wonted Valour, and quicke&s;t Di|&s;patch, for their Relief. The next thing I would have you con&s;ider is, how little Hopes the late Murmuring and Di&s;content (not to call it by a wor&s;e Name, which you have expre&s;&s;ed during a two or three Days long and difficult March, made perhaps &s;omewhat more tire&s;ome by the Badne&s;s of the Wea|ther), afford us of your meeting with the &s;ame Succe&s;s as tho&s;e brave <HI>Hebrews</HI> did, un|le&s;s you be brought to a better Sen&s;e of your Duty, before you come to engage our com|mon Enemy. And let me add, thirdly and la&s;tly, that &s;hould this prove the happy Ca&s;e, and God &s;hould &s;o far pro&s;per what I am now going to deliver to you, as to in&s;pire and ble&s;s you with an equal Courage and Readine&s;s, which tho&s;e generous <HI>Hebrews</HI> di&s;played on the like Occa&s;ion, I mu&s;t not forbear remind|ing you, that you will, even then, have the le&s;s Rea&s;on to become arrogant and a&s;&s;uming upon it; a thing but too common in the like Ca&s;es, &s;eeing, &s;hould your returning Loyalty and Valour atchieve what their &s;teady and un&s;haken one formerly did, the effectual De|liverance of the City, and the total Over-throw
<PB N="290" REF="320">
of the Enemy, yet your Laurels would come &s;till va&s;tly &s;hort of theirs, and be no le&s;s tarni&s;hed by the mutinous Reluctance you have hitherto &s;hewn on this Occa&s;ion, than theirs mu&s;t have been imbrightened by the &s;urpri&s;ing Chearfulne&s;s and Di&s;patch, which they di&s;played in that; &s;ince it plainly appears, that this Exploit, great and arduous as it was, did not, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, that is, from their receiving <HI>Saul</HI>'s fir&s;t Summons to the War, to their putting an effectual End to it by the total Overthrow of the <HI>Am|monites,</HI> take them up above five, or, at the mo&s;t, &s;ix Days.</P>
<P>But here it may be perhaps objected, that this la&s;t and mortifying Caution I have been giving you, might have more properly been deferred, till your &s;ingular Valour and Succe&s;s again&s;t the Enemy had called for it, than in&s;i&s;ted upon at this time, when you have &s;till a two Days long and difficult March to come at them; and the greate&s;t Part of you &s;eem to have &s;o little Stomach to either. It will perhaps be thought, that, in&s;tead of damping your Zeal and Valour, by this mor|tifying Caution, I ought rather to try to rou&s;e
<PB N="291" REF="321">
it up, by &s;uch enlivening Examples, as are to be met with in the Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Greek, Roman,</HI> and other antient Nations. And I might, indeed, here entertain you with a long Detail of <HI>Hannibal</HI>'s arduous and hazardous March through <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Gaul,</HI> over the <HI>Alps</HI> and <HI>Pyrenees,</HI> and forcing his Way thro' Mountains of Ice, and impenetrable Rocks, to come and attack the Enemies of his dear Coun|try, in the very Heart of theirs. I might remind you likewi&s;e of tho&s;e &s;urpri&s;ing and almo&s;t incredible Journeys, &s;hall I call them, or not rather Flights? which <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> is recorded to have taken from <HI>Rome,</HI> either to the <HI>Rho&s;ne</HI> or the <HI>Rhine,</HI> to qua&s;h &s;ome dangerous Re|volt in the Birth; and in which he him&s;elf tells us, that he had already reached the Ene|my, before the News of his Departure was known in that Capital. I might al&s;o, and with no le&s;s Plea&s;ure, expatiate on that glo|rious and unparalleled Retreat, which the celebrated <HI>Xenophon</HI> made at the Head of his 10,000 <HI>Greeks,</HI> by a March of above 23,000 Miles, through &s;trange and impa&s;&s;able Coun|tries, hara&s;&s;ed and pur&s;ued all the Way, as they were, by their implacable Enemies, from <HI>Babylon</HI> quite to the <HI>Euxine Sea.</HI> The&s;e
<PB N="292" REF="322">
and many other the like In&s;tances of Valour and Indefatigablene&s;s, could I produce out of profane Hi&s;tory; &s;ufficient, one would think, the lea&s;t of them, to rou&s;e the mo&s;t da&s;tardly and de&s;ponding among&s;t you to Courage and Activity, on &s;uch a criti|cal Juncture as this. But what Impre&s;|&s;ion can I expect &s;uch an elaborate Di&s;play of Oratory would make on &s;uch a di&s;con|tented Audience as I am &s;peaking to, but that of an ob&s;tinate Unbelief? Would not mo&s;t of you be ready to think, or even to &s;ay, that <HI>Cae&s;ar, Xenophon,</HI> and other pane|gyrical Retailers of their own heroic Deeds, do too plainly appear to have had a greater Regard to their own Glory than to Truth, to de&s;erve to be credited in every thing they have &s;aid? Would not you likewi&s;e be apt to allege, in Excu&s;e for your Want of Zeal or Courage, that the unbounded Ambition, Thir&s;t after Glory, Revenge, and other the like Motives, which hurried an <HI>Hannibal,</HI> or a <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> on &s;uch arduous and de&s;perate At|tempts, are of too ba&s;e a Nature, to be pro|po&s;ed for Imitation to a Chri&s;tian Army, e&s;|pecially on &s;uch a Juncture as this, and after your late mutinous Behaviour hath &s;o plainly
<PB N="293" REF="323">
convinced me, how hardly you are like to be wrought upon by tho&s;e of a more noble Nature, the Love and Defence of your Country, and the Pre&s;ervation of your Reli|gion and Liberties?</P>
<P>Well then, &s;o far I hope I &s;hall be ac|quitted, for not attempting to reduce you to your Duty from &s;uch precarious and ex|ceptionable Examples; and for confining my|&s;elf to &s;uch only, as are to be found in the &s;acred Books, and of who&s;e Authority you can have no Pretence for any &s;uch Doubts or Objections: For this Rea&s;on I have particu|larly &s;ingled out this In&s;tance, of <HI>Saul</HI>'s quick and effectual Relief of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed <HI>Jabe&s;h|ites,</HI> not only as it bears a vi&s;ible Analogy to the noble Enterprize, to which you are commanded by your King and Country, and again&s;t which you have &s;hewed &s;uch an un|generous and di&s;loyal Reluctancy, but like|wi&s;e in hopes that the great and almo&s;t in|&s;urmountable Difficulties, which the new <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Monarch, and his Army, were forced to overcome, in order to effect it in the &s;hort Space that was allotted to them, and the Ble&s;&s;ing that attended their zealous Endea|vours,
<PB N="294" REF="324">
and &s;urpri&s;ing Di&s;patch, will at once quell all your Murmurings and Di&s;contents; and, by God's A&s;&s;i&s;tance, in&s;pire you again with the like generous Ardour for your di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Fellow-Subjects, and &s;uch as may intitle you, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to the &s;ame Glory and Suc|ce&s;s with them: For if you duly compare with me the Nature of the Exploit I am go|ing to &s;et before your Eyes, the Difficulties that accompanied it, and the &s;hort Space that <HI>Saul</HI> had to perform it, with the wonderful Succe&s;s that attended it; if you con&s;ider that he had but five, or, at mo&s;t, &s;ix Days, to rai&s;e a &s;ufficient Force again&s;t a powerful, inveterate, and &s;ucce&s;sful Enemy, out of the ten Tribes on this Side <HI>Jordan,</HI> and to reach the Be&s;ieged on the other; and that he not only appeared there, at the Head of 330,000 armed Men before the Expiration of the time, but that he foreca&s;t his Matters with &s;uch uncommon Prudence, as to &s;urpri&s;e them on the very Morning in which they expected the City, with all its Inhabitants, to have been delivered up into their Hands; and, by falling upon them on every Side, to give them &s;uch a total Overthrow, as put at once an End to that threatening War; I &s;ay, if
<PB N="295" REF="325">
you duly weigh all the&s;e Circum&s;tances to|gether, you mu&s;t be forced to own it to be one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Actions that can be met with in any Hi&s;torian, either &s;acred or profane; e&s;pecially if you add to it, that the whole De&s;ign was conducted by a young Monarch, who had hardly reigned three Months when he went upon this Enterprize; had been till then conver&s;ant only in rural Af|fairs; and was &s;till wholly unaccu&s;tomed to martial Feats; and at a time when the <HI>Hebrews</HI> laboured under the mo&s;t grievous and di&s;cou|raging Circum&s;tances, as you will hear by and|by. Only give me Leave to ob&s;erve to you here, that this Tran&s;action, great, important, and &s;urpri&s;ing, as it was, is neverthele&s;s tran&s;|mitted to us here by the in&s;pired Penman, not in the pompous and &s;wollen Language of profane Hi&s;torians, but in the plaine&s;t and mo&s;t unaffected Stile, and &s;uch as any one would deem much below the Dignity of the Subject, did we not certainly know this to be an Excellency peculiar to the &s;acred Pen|men, and which is not to be met with in any but their in&s;pired Writings.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="326">
I doubt not but mo&s;t of you have read this &s;ingular Price of &s;acred Hi&s;tory over and over; and yet I much que&s;tion, whether any of you have looked upon it as any other than a plain Relation of &s;ome notable Fact, tran&s;|acted long ago; and in which you, at this Di&s;tance, are little or not at all concerned, beyond the bare Knowlege of it. And may it not be chiefly owing to the artle&s;s and in|imitable Simplicity, with which it is recorded by the &s;acred Hi&s;torian, that you have over-looked the mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing and remarkable Circum&s;tances of it, which could not &s;o ea|&s;ily have e&s;caped you, had they been intro|duced with tho&s;e florid Strokes of Rhetoric, which Hi&s;torians commonly deal in, when they want to rai&s;e our Attention or Admira|tion?

<P>If we now look upon the Condition the People were in, at the breaking out of this War, we &s;hall find it to the full as melan|choly and unpromi&s;ing, as that of their de|&s;pi&s;ed new Monarch. <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> informs us<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><HI>Antiq. l.</HI> vi. <HI>c.</HI> 5. <HI>ad fin.</HI></NOTE>, that the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed <HI>Jabe&s;hites</HI> had &s;ent in vain to implore the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the two Tribes and half on the other Side <HI>Jordan;</HI> and that not a Soul dared &s;tir Hand or Foot to their Relief. And the Text tells us, that when their Me&s;&s;engers reached the City of <HI>Gibeah,</HI> the Place of <HI>Saul</HI>'s Re&s;idence, and acquaiuted the Inhabitants with their extreme Di&s;tre&s;s, they could only have re|cour&s;e to their Cries<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xi. 4.</NOTE>; which plainly &s;hews, that their Hearts were readier to be|wail, than to a&s;&s;i&s;t, tho&s;e poor Sufferers; who, on their Part, were &s;o far &s;unk in|to De&s;pondency, that, in&s;tead of re&s;olv|ing to die Sword in Hand, in Defence of

E&s;pecially if we add to all this, the great Di&s;tance of &s;ome of the ten Tribes to the Place of Rendezvous, and the apparent Unlikelihood, not to &s;ay Impo&s;&s;ibi|lity, of their reaching the Be&s;iegers Camp &s;oon enough to &s;ave the City.

<PB N="305" REF="335">
the di&s;advantageous and di&s;tracted State of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Commonwealth, at this Jun cture.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> The next is drawn from the great Unlikelihood, that the <HI>Ammoniti&s;h</HI> King &s;hould grant the reduced <HI>Jabe&s;hites</HI> even &s;o poor a Re&s;pite as &s;even Days; or, allowing that he did &s;o, that he &s;hould be &s;o remi&s;s in his martial Di&s;cipline, and be &s;o void of all Intelligence of <HI>Saul,</HI> and his great Army, being in full March again&s;t him, as to &s;uffer him&s;elf to be &s;urpri&s;ed, &s;urrounded, and cut in Pieces, by three &s;uch va&s;t Bodies as his Army con&s;i&s;ted of.

of the Time allowed for completing &s;o &s;ignal a Deliverance, compared with the Di&s;tance of the &s;everal Places to which <HI>Saul</HI>'s dreadful Summons were directed; the Space of Time required for &s;uch a va&s;t Army to be equipped, and ready for a March; and the Length of the Way they had to go, to reach the Place of Rendezvous, and thence to come at the Camp of the Be&s;iegers. To make this the more plainly to appear, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> That the be&s;ieged City of <HI>Jabe&s;h</HI> could &s;tand at no le&s;s Di&s;tance from <HI>Gibeah,</HI> the Place of <HI>Saul</HI>'s Re&s;idence, than between &s;ixty and &s;eventy of our Miles; but perhaps con&s;iderably more, if we add to it the Mountainou&s;ne&s;s of the Country, the Windings and Turnings of the Roads, and the like: So that allowing the &s;even Days Time to have been granted to the Be&s;ieged ever &s;o early in the Morning, their Me&s;&s;en|gers can hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed to have reached <HI>Gibeah,</HI> till the Evening of the next Day. <HI>Soul</HI> therefore could have but five more Days to &s;ummon the ten Tribes to Arms; &s;ome of which, e&s;pecially on the South Side, were above an hundred Miles from <HI>Gibeah,</HI> and above an hundred and &s;ixty from <HI>Bezek,</HI> the

<P>3<HI>dly,</HI> then, In An&s;wer to the fir&s;t of the&s;e Difficulties, drawn from the di&s;advantageous Situation of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Commonwealth, at the breaking out of this <HI>Ammoniti&s;h</HI> War, both with re&s;pect to the apparent Inability of their new Monarch, and the De&s;pondency of the People, on account of their late De|fection from God; might not the &s;evere Threats which <HI>Samuel</HI> pronounced again&s;t them, which we find extorted &s;o humble and pathetic a Confe&s;&s;ion from them of their

However, it will be &s;ufficient here to ob&s;erve to you in general, that the whole Affair ap|pears plainly to have been conducted by the Divine Providence, and with the &s;ame gra|cious and con&s;tant View, of reducing that ungrateful and rebellious People to their Obe|dience to, and &s;teady Dependence on him; from both which they had &s;o &s;hamefully &s;werved, during the latter End of <HI>Eli</HI> their Judge and High-Prie&s;t's remi&s;s Government; and as a due Puni&s;hment for which, he had &s;uffered them to be thus depre&s;&s;ed at this time<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Sam.</HI> ii. 27, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI> iii, II, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI> iv. <HI>pa&s;&s;.</HI></NOTE>. The Book of <HI>Judges</HI> furni&s;hes us with many &s;ignal In&s;tances of the like Na|ture, wherein God was plea&s;ed to &s;uffer them to &s;ink into the lowe&s;t State of Slavery and De&s;pondency, for their frequent Defections and Idolatries; and afterwards to rai&s;e them to their pri&s;tine Freedom, and pro&s;perous State, by &s;uch unlikely and di&s;parate means, as might be&s;t direct their Eyes and Hearts to him. This we find was the Ca&s;e, when he delivered them from their &s;everal Thral|doms,
<PB N="314" REF="344">
under the Conduct of <HI>Deborah</HI> and <HI>Ba|rack,</HI> of <HI>Gideon, Jephthah,</HI> and others of their Chiefs<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vid. int. al.

And let me add here, that as the People never &s;tood in greater Need of &s;uch a gracious <HI>Memento,</HI> than at this time, when, in the Height of all their Di&s;tre&s;s, they &s;eem to have &s;o far ca&s;t off the Divine Protection, as to put their &s;ole Hope and Re|medy in having a King &s;et over them, for their Deliverer; &s;o nothing could be more proper to reduce them from their mi&s;placed Confidence, than the giving them &s;uch an unpromi&s;ing one as <HI>Saul</HI> was; and then, upon the very fir&s;t Emergency, to in&s;pire him with &s;uch unexpected Fortitude and Conduct; and to crown it with &s;uch wonderful and un|hoped for Succe&s;s. For this could hardly fail of in&s;piring both King and People with a fre&s;h and &s;urer Tru&s;t and Dependence on God, above any human Help. Accordingly, you may remember, that God had taken care to encourage the new Monarch with &s;uch a kind of Promi&s;e, from the very Be|ginning, by the Mouth of his Prophet, in the&s;e Words; <HI>And the Spirit of the Lord will come upon thee, and thou &s;halt become</HI>

In con&s;equence of which Divine A&s;&s;urance it was, no doubt, that <HI>Saul,</HI> on his returning from the Field, and hearing the Outcries of the People, on account of the <HI>Jabe&s;hites,</HI> felt &s;uch an uncommon Warmth at their Di&s;tre&s;s, as well as Re&s;entment again&s;t the pu&s;illani|mous and de&s;ponding <HI>Gibeathites,</HI> that he immediately ordered the two Bullocks to be hewn in Pieces, and &s;ent to each Tribe, with the dreadful Summons mentioned in my Text; <HI>Who&s;oever cometh not forth after</HI> Saul <HI>and after</HI> Samuel, <HI>&s;o &s;hall it be done unto his Oxen.</HI> The Re&s;ult of which was, that they were &s;truck with Fear and Dread, and made &s;o quick a Di&s;patch to join him at the Place of Rendezvous, that they were all got thi|ther, from every Tribe, with one Con&s;ent, a Day at lea&s;t before the Expiration of the Truce, and to the Number of 330,000 ef|fective Men.

For as to the fir&s;t, the Text expre&s;ly affirms, that <HI>the Spirit of God came upon</HI> Saul; and it is hard|ly to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that any thing but &s;uch an extraordinary Impul&s;e, could have frighted his heartle&s;s and de&s;ponding Subjects into &s;o ready, quick, and univer&s;al, Compliance with his Commands; e&s;pecially as the Danger that threatened them was &s;o far off, <HI>Jabe&s;h</HI> being on the other Side <HI>Jordan,</HI> and at a good Di|&s;tance from the greate&s;t Part of the Tribes; and the Lo&s;s of it not appearing to them of &s;uch Con&s;equence, as to require &s;o quick a Di&s;patch, had there been a much greater Probability of their &s;ucceeding in their At|tempt to relieve it.

I &s;hall here only remind you of that &s;ignal Infatuation of the <HI>French</HI> General, Count <HI>Tallard,</HI> who, when he might ea&s;ily have oppo&s;ed the confederate Army, under the late glorious Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> from pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Rhine,</HI> to come at him, did yet &s;uffer them to cro&s;s that rapid River unmo|le&s;ted; alleging, that the more &s;hould come over to them, the more would be either killed or taken; the Con&s;equence of which egregious Over&s;ight, you may well remem|ber, was the total Defeat of the <HI>French</HI> Army at <HI>Hock&s;tedt,</HI> the Taking of their in&s;olent General Pri&s;oner, with a prodigious Number of other commanding Officers of Di&s;tinction, and the Saving of the Empire from the mo&s;t impending Danger.</P>

Accordingly, as &s;oon as they were directed, by the &s;upernatural Cloud, for a new March, they had three Sig|nals given through the whole Camp; the fir&s;t, for taking up their Tents, and packing up their Baggage; the &s;econd, for &s;ummoning each Tribe to appear under their re&s;pective Standards and Chiefs, accoutred and armed, or to repair to the &s;everal other Po&s;ts a&s;&s;ign|ed to them; and the la&s;t, for moving in &s;uch a Number of Columns, as they were direct|ed, or as the Ground would permit.

<P>They had another Convenience likewi&s;e, for the quick Di&s;patch of their Intelligence; <HI>viz.</HI> by their Dromedaries; a Creature very common in all tho&s;e Ea&s;tern Parts, and &s;o &s;wift-footed, that they were chiefly u&s;ed for Expedition by the Rich; and we are told, that they commonly travelled 100 Miles, and &s;ome of them 150 Miles, a Day<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vincent, Le Blanc's Travels, Part</HI> ii. <HI>c.</HI> 22.</NOTE>.

then might the <HI>Jabe&s;hite</HI> Me&s;&s;engers reach <HI>Saul</HI> at <HI>Gibeah</HI> on the fir&s;t Evening of the Truce; and this will give him one Day more to atchieve their Deliverance, than the Ob|jectors &s;eem willing to allow. But all this will &s;till go but a little Way towards ac|counting for the prodigious Di&s;patch he made in &s;ending his threatening Summons to all the ten Tribes, and they in joining him at the general Rendezvous; unle&s;s we can find out &s;ome &s;till more expeditious Method, from their martial Di&s;cipline, for conveying the Alarm throughout the Kingdom, and for the &s;ummoned Tribes repairing to their re&s;pect|ive Standards, armed and expedited for &s;uch a March.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t, we may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, that the Alarm, or Summons for a general Armament, were conveyed thro' the King|dom by Beacons, or firy Signals, kindled upon the Tops of the Hills; which, con&s;i|dering the Mountainou&s;ne&s;s of the Country, and the few Plains of any Length there were in it, might ea&s;ily &s;pread it&s;elf thro' every Part of it, in the Space of a few Hours. The&s;e Beacons we find often mentioned

in the Prophets, and were in u&s;e not only among the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> but among all the an|tient Nations that were &s;eated in hilly Coun|tries<NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">Of the&s;e firy Sig|nals, or Beacons, we find frequent Mention in the Prophets<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vid. int. al.

For, in &s;ome Ca&s;es, only two or three Tribes were to be &s;ummoned to Arms, as in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Deborah, Gideon, Jephthah,</HI> &amp;c.; and in others, as in that of all the Tribes again&s;t the <HI>Ben|jamites</HI><NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jud.</HI> xix. 29, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI> xx. 1, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI></NOTE>, and in that we are upon, the whole Nation was to appear in Arms.

va&s;t Di&s;tance from each other, e&s;pecially in the Night-time, and being moreover di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by &s;ome well known Difference, ac|cording to the Notice or Orders they were to convey, were immediately an&s;wered by the Sounds of the Trumpets in the Valleys be|low; &s;o that not a City or Village, whether &s;ituate on high or low Ground, could be ex|empt from the general Alarm, or ignorant of the De&s;ign of it, either from the Nature of the Signal, or the different Sounding of the Trumpets, in a le&s;s Space than a Night. Whenever therefore the Import of the Alarm was for a general Armament, every Man that was able to bear Arms, being obliged, ac|cording to their martial Di&s;cipline, to repair with their proper Weapons and Accoutre|ments, to their re&s;pective Standards, un|der the &s;evere&s;t Penalties; they had nothing to do but to ha&s;ten to their Arms, and to furni&s;h them&s;elves with two or three Days Provi&s;ions for the Mouth; which, being com|monly of the dried Kind, &s;uch as Bread, parched Corn, Pul&s;e, Figs, Rai&s;ins, Dates, and the like, was &s;peedily got; and to join their Brethren of the &s;ame Tribe, at the ge|neral Rendezvous belonging to it. Here
<PB N="337" REF="367">
they were fir&s;t mu&s;tered by their re&s;pective Chiefs, or Captains of Hundreds, of Thou|&s;ands, and at la&s;t by the Head of the whole Tribe. After which they had nothing to do, but to wait till the Orders came from above, when and whither to begin their March. Thus, <HI>Gibeah</HI> being &s;ituate about the Centre of <HI>Judea,</HI> or at about an equal Di&s;tance from <HI>Dan</HI> and <HI>Beer&s;heba,</HI> the two extreme Boundaries of it, North and South; it is rea|&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Alarm had reach|ed both, by the&s;e expeditious Signals, long enough before the next Morning; whil&s;t tho&s;e that were &s;eated nearer the Centre were, in all Likelihood, ready for March, as &s;oon as they received their Orders and Route from their King or Chief: For I take it for grant|ed, that the&s;e were not di&s;patched to every City and Village of the Kingdom; which would have required too long a time, as well as too great a Number of Couriers, but were communicated only at this general Rendez|vous of each Tribe; and this, we may &s;up|po&s;e, was at, or near, the Place of Re&s;idence of each re&s;pective Chief of it.

I may add, that the Expre&s;&s;ion which we tran&s;late, to all the Coa&s;ts of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> might be more properly rendered, to eve|ry Boundary, or, perhaps, rather, to every Place fixed and a&s;&s;igned for a Bounda|ry, between Tribe and Tribe; or that appointed for their general A&s;&s;em|blies, whether upon civil or military Affairs. Con|&s;idering therefore the fre|quent and &s;udden Irrup|tions they were expo&s;ed to, from their Enemies within, and round about, them; there could not be a more expeditious Way found out, than for every Tribe to repair, armed and ac|coutred, to &s;uch appointed Places of Rendezvous, up|on every Alarm, for a ge|neral Armament; and there to wait for further Orders from above, how to act, and whither to march.</NOTE>; which in|&s;pired them with &s;uch a general Dread, and
<PB N="339" REF="369">
Readine&s;s to obey them. By this excellent and expeditious Way, tho&s;e Tribes that were near|e&s;t to the Re&s;idence of their Judge or King, being the fir&s;t that received both the Alarm, and Summons to Arms, could, in few Hours, be equipped, and ready to march to the Place appointed; and there begin to be reviewed, or even di&s;patched upon any nece&s;&s;ary Expe|dition; whil&s;t the more di&s;tant ones were daily arriving in their Turns, till they amount|ed to a &s;ufficient Number for the de&s;igned Enterprize. Allowing therefore the Me&s;&s;en|gers of <HI>Jabe&s;h-Gilead</HI> to have reached <HI>Gibeah</HI> on the fir&s;t Evening of the Truce, and the general Alarm to have reached both Ends of the Kingdom in that one Night (both which I have &s;hewn to have been very fea&s;ible); where, I pray you, is the Impo&s;&s;ibility, or even Improbability, that the mo&s;t di&s;tant Tribes from <HI>Bezek,</HI> the Place of Rendezvous, which were tho&s;e of <HI>Judah, Simeon,</HI> and <HI>Dan,</HI> the farthe&s;t of which was not above 160 Miles, &s;hould reach it in the following &s;ix Days, or even in le&s;s time, con&s;idering that they might take the Advantage of marching in Columns, thro' a Country that abounded with Highways, kept ea&s;y and
<PB N="340" REF="370">
plain for Expedition; and that they had no other Luggage to retard them, than their Weapons and Provi&s;ions, nor any Enemies to ob&s;truct their Way, or retard their Speed?</P>
<P>But farther let me ob&s;erve to you here, that if we compare the Mu&s;ter of <HI>Saul</HI>'s Army upon this Occa&s;ion, with tho&s;e we find recorded both before and &s;ince that time, we &s;hall find it to come &s;o far &s;hort of them<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">Thus we find, in the War which the Tribes undertook again&s;t the <HI>Ben|jamites,</HI> mentioned in the la&s;t E&s;&s;ay, they amounted to 400,000 effective Men, exclu&s;ive of that of <HI>Benja|min</HI><NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jud.</HI> xx. 2.</NOTE>: Whereas here <HI>Saul</HI> had but 330,000. In a <HI>Cen&s;us</HI> likewi&s;e which <HI>David</HI> cau&s;ed to be made of all <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> &s;ome time be|fore his Death, the total Sum of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> was 800,000, and of <HI>Judah</HI> 500,000<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Kings</HI> xxiv. 9.</NOTE>. So that the 30,000, which joined <HI>Saul,</HI> were but a &s;mall Part of what this la&s;t Tribe mu&s;t have amount|ed to, had he &s;taid for the re&s;t; who, it is pro|bable, being the mo&s;t di|&s;tant of all, were not able to reach him time enough, with all the Speed they could make; which, in this Ca&s;e, was a &s;ufficient Excu&s;e.</NOTE>, as to give us room to &s;uppo&s;e, that he did not &s;tay for the coming of tho&s;e that were the mo&s;t remote; but that find|ing tho&s;e that were already arrived, by the la&s;t Day of the Truce, to be more than &s;uf|ficient
<PB N="341" REF="371">
for his Purpo&s;e, he gave immediate Orders for marching again&s;t the Enemy with all Speed, leaving the re&s;t to come after as &s;oon as they could; &s;ince they were equally included in the Summons, and an&s;werable for Non-attendance.</P>
<P>For I mu&s;t take Leave here to remind you of another Piece of their Di&s;cipline, mentioned in a former E&s;&s;ay, as e&s;tabli&s;hed among them by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;hua; viz.</HI> that every Male, from twenty to &s;ixty, was to be inrolled in his re&s;pective Tribe, and ob|liged to appear in Arms under his re&s;pective Standard, upon every &s;uch Alarm, under the &s;evere&s;t Penalties; unle&s;s hindered by Sick|ne&s;s, Lamene&s;s, or any other lawful Impedi|ment<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>What tho&s;e other Impediments and Abatements from the Rigour of this martial Law were, the Reader may &s;ee, among other Places, in</HI> Deut. xx. 5, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI></NOTE>. The&s;e Rolls were &s;o carefully kept, not only by the Heads of every Tribe, but by the inferior Captains of the Hundreds and Thou&s;ands, and called over before and after the Engagement, that none could ab|&s;ent them&s;elves without being di&s;covered, and called to an Account for it. And this afford|ed a farther Conveniency, that, as there was
<PB N="342" REF="372">
no Danger of their de&s;erting, &s;o there was no Nece&s;&s;ity of their marching in large re|gular Bodies, unle&s;s it were through an Ene|my's Country; but, in their own, they might &s;afely move on towards the Rendezvous, in the mo&s;t convenient or expeditious manner, as Occa&s;ion required, &s;o they but reached it time enough to an&s;wer to their Names, at the general Review. Let me add, that the dreadful Cata&s;trophe of the Inhabitants of this very City of <HI>Jabe&s;h,</HI> who were all put to the Sword, except about 400 Virgins, for not having joined the re&s;t of the Tribes in the War they waged again&s;t that of <HI>Benja|min,</HI> two or three Centuries before, is a plain Indication of the Severity with which they puni&s;hed all &s;uch Defaults. So that the very Name of <HI>Jabe&s;h-Gilead</HI> was enough, at this time, to remind the whole Nation of the Dan|ger of di&s;obeying <HI>Saul</HI>'s pre&s;&s;ing Commands. Thus, then, you &s;ee how po&s;&s;ible, and even ea&s;y, it was for that Monarch to get &s;uch a numerous Army ready at the Place of Ren|dezvous, and to lead them again&s;t the Be|&s;iegers time enough before the Expiration of the Truce; which &s;urpri&s;ing Di&s;patch, how|ever, was chiefly owing to the excellent
<PB N="343" REF="373">
Laws, and military Di&s;cipline, which had been e&s;tabli&s;hed among them; &s;o that by the Help of it he was able to accompli&s;h that, in five or &s;ix Days, which, without it, would have been impracticable in &s;o many Weeks, and, in our Times, in &s;o many Months. Hence therefore you may plainly &s;ee, it was not without good Grounds that I affirmed, that the pretended Impo&s;&s;ibility, urged by our Critics, doth wholly proceed from their Ignorance of, or Inattention to, this Branch of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>I may, therefore, by this time, pre&s;ume to hope, that I have effectually removed eve|ry Difficulty that can be rea&s;onably rai&s;ed again&s;t the Truth of this remarkable and &s;ignal Tran&s;action. However, it may ju&s;tly appear, when con&s;idered in all its Circum|&s;tances, and &s;urpri&s;ing Succe&s;s, to exceed any that we meet with, either in &s;acred or profane Hi&s;tory. So that we need not won|der, that it &s;hould in&s;pire the <HI>Hebrews</HI> with &s;uch extraordinary Regard for their new Monarch, that nothing le&s;s could now &s;atisfy them, than the immediate Death of tho&s;e Malecontents, who had lately affronted him

by their contemptuous Language and Behavi|our<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xv. 17, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI> xxii. 17, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI></NOTE>: And had he been as vindictive and re&s;enting, as they were now zealous for him, he mu&s;t unavoidably have &s;ullied the Glory of that noble Victory by &s;uch a mean and un|worthy Piece of Revenge.

Well might they triumph now, that they had a King indeed given to them by God! And &s;uch an one, as they might firmly hope would, upon all Occa&s;ions, behave as his cho&s;en and worthy Vicegerent, whether in protecting his own People, &s;uppre&s;&s;ing their Enemies, or in the gaining the Love of &s;uch of his rebellious Subjects, by his &s;ignal Benignity, whom nei|ther his Dignity, Valour, nor Conduct, could

reduce to their Duty. Happy King! happy Subjects! happy in the Protection and Favour of the Divine Providence! happy in the Zeal and Harmony which now reigns between them, and the plea&s;ing Pro&s;pect which they have now before them! But neither of them did continue long, either in this bli&s;sful Har|mony, or under the Favour of their Almighty Protector. <HI>Saul</HI> grew proud, di&s;obedient, and cruel<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Sam.</HI> xxi. 1.</NOTE>; and was rejected by God; and the People, returning to their old Super|&s;titions, and heatheni&s;h Idolatries, became &s;uch Da&s;tards, and errant Cowards, that, up|on the very next Danger that threatens them, in&s;tead of obeying his Summons, and follow|ing him again&s;t the Enemy, with the &s;ame Courage and Readine&s;s they had done again&s;t the <HI>Ammonites,</HI> they only &s;eek to <HI>hide them|&s;elves in Caves and Dens, in Rocks, high Places, and Pits, or to cro&s;s over the</HI> Jordan <HI>into the Land of</HI> Gilead<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xiii. 6, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI></NOTE>: In&s;omuch that, when he came to number his &s;mall Force, he found it dwindled to 600 Men<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid. ver.</HI> 15, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI></NOTE>, and all of them de&s;titute of warlike Weapons.

But, let me tell you, this is another of your bungling Ways of interpreting the Scriptures; and that <HI>Job</HI> meant nothing le&s;s, than what you would ex|tort from him: He expected, indeed, to have found it &s;o; and that his three old Vi&s;itors would have proved much better Coun&s;ellors and Comforters than they did: But, upon
<PB N="351" REF="381">
finding him&s;elf &s;adly di&s;appointed, you may &s;ee plainly enough, that he &s;cruples not to expo&s;e both their boa&s;ted Wi&s;dom and Kindne&s;s in &s;uch &s;trong Terms, as they in|deed de&s;erved. Nay, you'll find, if you read on but to the thirty-&s;econd and following Chapters, how <HI>Elihu,</HI> tho' a much younger and mode&s;ter Per&s;on, di&s;play'd a much higher Degree of Wi&s;dom, and &s;ublimer Theology, than they all; and how &s;everely God him&s;elf reproved tho&s;e three Pretenders, for their Va|nity and Folly: And I doubt not but tho&s;e Antients, who are the Fomenters of your pre&s;ent Di&s;content, will, upon a fuller In|quiry, be found to be Men of the &s;ame, if not wor&s;e, Leaven; wi&s;e indeed in their own and your Opinion, but Traitors in their Hearts. But what I would gladly know is, what Arguments the&s;e old Pretenders to &s;upe|rior Wi&s;dom could u&s;e, to draw you into this dangerous and &s;hameful Step: Not &s;urely &s;uch as flow from Scripture; for that plainly tells you, that Obedience is better than Sacrifice; and that Rebellion is as the Sin of Witchcraft (1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xv. 23.): Nor yet from Rea&s;on; for that goes Hand in Hand with the Word of God; and both will tell you, that Anarchy
<PB N="352" REF="382">
and Ruin mu&s;t be the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence of all &s;uch unnatural Defections, if not timely &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, when our All lies at Stake, as it doth now. What then could they urge to fa&s;cinate and bewitch you into this ba&s;e Di&s;|loyalty? Have they chilled your da&s;tardly Hearts with the fal&s;e Pretence of &s;ome great Di&s;parity between you and the Enemy you are to engage? At pre&s;ent, Thanks be to God, you are greatly &s;uperior to them in Number; and might be much more &s;o in Strength and Courage, would but your tur|bulent Spirit &s;uffer you to con&s;ider, what a ju&s;t Cau&s;e you are engaged in, and what Rea|&s;on there is to hope, that we have a ju&s;t God on our Side. And you, as well as I, may well enough remember the times when this very la&s;t Con&s;ideration would have in&s;pired an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ho&s;t, on an Occa&s;ion like this, with &s;uch noble Ardour, that they would have de&s;pi&s;ed much greater Difficulties to attack an Enemy, though in all other re&s;pects &s;uperior to them. The Time was, I &s;ay, and you cannot but know, when the Greatne&s;s of the Danger, Fatigues, or other Ob&s;tacles, would, on &s;uch an Emergency as you are now called upon, have only &s;erved to whet their Appe|tite,
<PB N="353" REF="383">
and inflame their Hearts with a noble Ardor, either to conquer or die in &s;o honour|able a Cau&s;e: Whence then this &s;trange, this &s;hameful, this ill-boding, Change? Hath your old martial Genius for&s;aken you? Are Loyalty to your King, the Love of your Country, and Zeal for our Religion, &s;o far extingui&s;hed in you, by a few Days unu&s;ual Fatigue, that you &s;hould all appear thus re&s;olutely, or ra|ther treacherou&s;ly, bent again&s;t complying with the Orders of your Commanders, and acting with the requi&s;ite Di&s;patch, which alone, for aught you know, can prevent our pre&s;ent Danger from becoming de&s;perate, and the Lo&s;s of our Laws and Liberties irretrieva|ble? How &s;hall we interpret this mon&s;trous Behaviour, this unnatural Defection, of yours? Mu&s;t we take it as a &s;ad Omen, that God hath forgot to be gracious to this once happy I&s;le? and that he will no longer protect our religious and civil Rights, again&s;t the avowed Enemies of both? Good Heaven pre&s;erve us from &s;o ungrateful a De&s;pondency! God is &s;till able to &s;ave us, whether by few or many; and is never more ready to do &s;o, than when called upon in our greate&s;t Extremities. And &s;hould you &s;till ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;t in your
<PB N="354" REF="384">
Di&s;obedience, or even turn your Arms again&s;t your native Country&mdash;But Heaven be prai&s;ed, who bids me, by your relenting Tears, and &s;udden Change, to hope for better things, and to expect a quite contrary Behaviour, from you! A Behaviour, worthy of the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Blood you boa&s;t of; and &s;uch as will not only wipe off the Shame and Di&s;grace of your ba&s;e Murmurings and Complaints, but yield you, in a few Days, a plentiful Harve&s;t of Laurels, and to the Nation a joyful Occa|&s;ion of Thank&s;giving: Whil&s;t the Remor&s;e for your late Defection in&s;pires your Hearts with fre&s;h Motives of Courage and Loyalty, and with &s;uch Confidence in God, and Pity for your di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Fellow-Subjects, as may bring down a Ble&s;&s;ing from Heaven upon our pre&s;ent Expedition. Heaven alone knows what will be the Effect of this happy Change I perceive in you: I may, perhaps, have given my Hopes too great a Scope; we are naturally apt to do &s;o in things which we mo&s;t earne&s;tly wi&s;h; and, for that Rea&s;on, am the more willing to &s;ubmit the Event of it to him, who alone could &s;o timely work it in you: For, if it prove &s;incere and la&s;ting, I &s;hall have much greater Cau&s;e to a&s;cribe it to his
<PB N="355" REF="385">
Grace, than to any thing that I did, or could have pre&s;&s;ed, upon the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion, from that &s;ingular and &s;ucce&s;sful Example of the generous <HI>Hebrew</HI> Monarch. And if his Goodne&s;s &s;hould magnify it&s;elf &s;till further in our Favour, and crown this pre&s;ent Enter|prize with the de&s;ired Succe&s;s; if the &s;ame Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, which &s;eems to have thus timely rekindled your wonted Valour and Courage in your Brea&s;ts, &s;hould farther enable you, as it did tho&s;e noble <HI>Hebrews,</HI> not only to free your di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Fellow-Subjects from the impending Danger they are in, but to give the Enemies of our Country as total an Over-throw as they did to theirs; if this, I &s;ay, &s;hould prove the happy I&s;&s;ue of this Expedi|tion, I &s;hall have the le&s;s to &s;ay to you, by way of Warning; &s;ince your late Mi&s;be|haviour and Defection, duly laid to Heart, will be the be&s;t Antidote I can give you, again&s;t your becoming in&s;olent and arrogant, or your a&s;cribing any Part of the Glory to any, but to his divine and all-gracious Pro|vidence.</P>
<P>However, as there may be &s;till &s;ome Cau&s;e to fear, le&s;t this &s;udden and unhoped for
<PB N="356" REF="386">
Change &s;hould not prove &s;o &s;teady and uni|ver&s;al, as I do heartily wi&s;h it to be; and le&s;t there &s;hould &s;till remain, in any of your Brea&s;ts, &s;ome bitter Root of Di&s;content and Murmuring again&s;t your Superiors; I &s;hall con|clude this Di&s;cour&s;e with one Con&s;ideration more, which I earne&s;tly advi&s;e you to mind (whatever el&s;e you may think unworthy your Attention with re&s;pect to what I have hitherto &s;aid); and that is, that if there be &s;till any &s;uch among&s;t you, that have &s;o far hardened them|&s;elves again&s;t the Sword of the Spirit, by which I have been &s;triving to reduce you to a Sen&s;e of your Duty and Loyalty, and is the only kind of Weapon that our Church is al|lowed to u&s;e; they will find, to their Co&s;t and Sorrow, that the State is entru&s;ted to, and, Thanks be to Heaven, is &s;till in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, one of a much harder Metal, and keener Edge, and &s;uch as will admit of no Re&s;i&s;t|ance. And this I am bound in Duty to re|mind you of, more particularly at this time, not only as it is equally granted by God, for the Puni&s;hment of the &s;tubborn and di&s;loyal, as for the Pre&s;ervation and Defence of the peaceable and liege Subject<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> xiii. 2, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI></NOTE>; but likewi&s;e,

But I mu&s;t call to mind, that you will, in a few Hours, be &s;ummoned to march; and &s;hall clo&s;e this Di&s;cour&s;e, as the Prophet <HI>Samuel</HI> did to the murmuring <HI>I&s;raelites</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xii. 23.</NOTE>; <HI>As for me, God forbid that I &s;hould cea&s;e praying and interceding for you, and &s;hewing you the good and right Way;</HI> your Duty to your King and Country, and the Guilt and Dan|ger of oppo&s;ing your&s;elves again&s;t it!

<HEAD>The CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>THUS far, Sir, went this occa&s;ional Di&s;|cour&s;e, which, as I formerly hinted to you, had the de&s;ired Effect on the lower Cla&s;s of the Audience, to whom it &s;eemed chieny directed; tho', in Fact, principally le|velled again&s;t the Heads of tho&s;e Malecon|tents. You will excu&s;e me, if my Fear of hurting &s;ome of them, who are &s;till alive, and, I hope, in a better Mind, re&s;trains me from giving you any farther Account of the Occa&s;ion of it, than that the underhand Pro|moters of this Defection being mo&s;tly pro|fe&s;&s;ed Dei&s;ts and Republicans, though, in other re&s;pects, Men of Figure and Authority, there was an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity to draw away the inferior Officers and Soldiers from the im|plicit Confidence they put in them: And this, it was thought, could not be more ef|fectually done, con&s;idering the Shortne&s;s of the time, than by cau&s;ing &s;ome &s;uch rou&s;ing Di&s;cour&s;e as this to be penned, and preached to them; and, at the &s;ame time, by making Choice of &s;ome &s;uch curious and uncommon Topics, as might, as much as po&s;&s;ible, en|gro&s;s
<PB N="359" REF="389">
the Attention of tho&s;e Leaders, who were Men of Parts, and polite Literature, in order to prevent their cau&s;ing any Di&s;turb|ance, which might interrupt the Preacher from going on.</P>
<P>The Ta&s;k of penning it being impo&s;ed upon me, the Urgency of the Occa&s;ion, and the &s;hort time given me to perform it, &s;oon brought into my Mind that noble and &s;ignal Overthrow, which <HI>Saul,</HI> the new <HI>Hebrew</HI> King, gave to the <HI>Ammonites;</HI> a Subject up|on which I had formerly be&s;towed &s;ome Pains, and which now appeared to me &s;o &s;uitable to the Occa&s;ion, that I immediately &s;et about and dre&s;&s;ed it up in the Form, Me|thod and very Words, in which you have &s;een it above; excepting only that I have thrown &s;ome Geographical, and other ex|planatory Remarks, into Notes; which, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, clogged and interrupted the Stile of the Text. An Inconveniency which could not be &s;o well avoided, in a Di&s;cour&s;e that was to be delivered off-hand to an Au|dience, as when it is penned to be read at one's Lei&s;ure. However, the Piece was li&s;tened to without Interruption; and was
<PB N="360" REF="390">
&s;carcely fini&s;hed, before the good Effect of it appeared, in the &s;urpri&s;ing Change it wrought on the malecontent. Troops, as well as in the Succe&s;s that crowned, &s;oon after, their re|trieved Loyalty and Bravery.</P>
<P>I &s;hall take it as a Favour, if you'll let me know, in your next, how it is reli&s;hed by your Sceptic Neighbours; after which I &s;hall readily &s;end you my An&s;wers to their re|maining Queries and Objections, with all the Di&s;patch I am able to make: Being, in the Interim,</P>
