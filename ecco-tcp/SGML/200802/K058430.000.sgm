<HEAD>A NARRATIVE of the LIFE OF Mrs. <HI>Charlotte Charke.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS the following Hi&s;tory is the Product of a Female Pen, I tremble for the terrible Hazard it mu&s;t run in ventur|ing into the World, as it may very po&s;&s;ibly &s;uffer, in many Opinions, without peru&s;ing it; I therefore humbly move for its having the common Chance of a Criminal, at lea&s;t to be properly examin'd, before it is condemn'd: And &s;hould it be found guilty of Non&s;en&s;e
<PB N="12" REF="12">
and Incon&s;i&s;tencies, I mu&s;t con&s;equently re&s;ign it to its de&s;erved Puni&s;hment; in&s;tead of being honour'd with the la&s;t Row of a Library, undergo the Indignancy of pre&s;erving the Syrup of many a choice Tart; which, when purchas'd, even the ha&s;ty Child will &s;oon give an In&s;tance of its Contempt of my Mu&s;e, by committing to the Flames, or perhaps ca&s;t it to the Ground, to be trampled to Death by &s;ome Thread-bare Poet, who&s;e Works might po&s;&s;ibly have undergone the &s;ame Malevolence of Fate.</P>
<P>However, I mu&s;t beg Leave to inform tho&s;e Ladies and Gentlemen, who&s;e Tenderne&s;s and Compa&s;&s;ion may excite 'em to make this little Brat of my Brain the Companion of an idle Hour, that I have paid all due Regard to Decency wherever I have introduc'd the Pa&s;&s;ion of Love; and have only &s;uffer'd it to take its Cour&s;e in its proper and nece&s;&s;ary Time, without ful&s;omely inflaming the Minds of my young Readers, or &s;hamefully offend|ing tho&s;e of riper Years; a Fault I have often condemn'd, when I was my&s;elf but a Girl, in &s;ome Female Poets. I &s;hall not de&s;cant on their Imprudence, only wi&s;h that their Works had been le&s;s confined to that Theme, which too often led 'em into Errors, Rea&s;on and Mode&s;ty equally forbid.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="13">
In Regard to the various Subjects of my Story, I have, I think, taken Care to make 'em &s;o intere&s;ting, that every Per&s;on who reads my Volume may bear a Part in &s;ome Circum|&s;tance or other in the Peru&s;al, as there is no|thing in&s;erted but what may daily happen to every Mortal breathing.</P>
<P>Not that I would have the Publick con|ceive, tho' I am endeavouring to recommend it to their Protection, that my Vanity can &s;o far overcome my &s;mall Share of Rea&s;on, as to impute the Succe&s;s it &s;hould meet with to any other Motive, than a kind Conde&s;cen&s;ion in my Readers to pity and encourage one, who has u&s;ed her utmo&s;t Endeavours to en|tertain 'em.</P>
<P>As I have promis'd to give &s;ome Account of my UNACCOUNTABLE LIFE, I &s;hall no longer detain my Readers in re&s;pect to my Book, but &s;atisfy a Curio&s;ity which has long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in the Minds of many: And, I believe, they will own, when they know my Hi&s;tory, if Oddity can plead any Right to Surprize and A&s;toni&s;hment, I may po&s;itively claim a Title to be &s;hewn among the Wonders of Ages pa&s;t, and tho&s;e to come. Nor will I, to e&s;cape a Laugh, even at my own Ex|pence,
<PB N="14" REF="14">
deprive my Readers of that plea&s;ing Satisfaction, or conceal any Error, which I now rather &s;igh to reflect on; but formerly, thro' too much Vacancy of Thought, might be idle enough rather to ju&s;tify than con|demn.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now begin my Detail of the &s;everal Stages I have pa&s;s'd thro' &s;ince my Birth, which made me the la&s;t-born of Mr. <HI>Colley Cibber,</HI> at a Time my Mother began to think, without this additional Ble&s;&s;ing (meaning my &s;weet Self) &s;he had fully an&s;wer'd the End of her Creation, being ju&s;t Forty-five Years of Age when &s;he produc'd her la&s;t, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"THO' NOT LEAST IN LOVE."</Q> Nor was I exempted from an equal Share in my Father's Heart; yet, partly thro' my own Indi&s;cretion (and, I am too well convinc'd, from the cruel Cen&s;ure of fal&s;e and evil Tongues) &s;ince my Maturity, I lo&s;t that Ble&s;&s;ing: Which, if &s;tronge&s;t Compunction and uninterrupted Hours of Angui&s;h, blended with Self-conviction and filial Love, can move his Heart to Pity and Forgivene&s;s, I &s;hall, with Pride and unutterable Tran&s;port, throw my&s;elf at his Feet, to im|plore the only Benefit I de&s;ire or expect, his BLESSING, and his PARDON.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="15">
But of that, more hereafter&mdash;And I hope, ere this &s;mall Treati&s;e is fini&s;h'd, to have it in my Power to inform my Readers, my painful Separation from my once tender Father will be more than amply repaid, by a happy Interview; as I am certain neither my pre&s;ent or future Conduct, &s;hall ever give him Cau&s;e to blu&s;h at what I &s;hould e&s;teem a ju&s;tifiable and nece&s;&s;ary Reconciliation, as 'tis the ab&s;olute Ordination of the Supreme that we &s;hould forgive, when the Offender becomes a &s;incere and hearty Penitent. And I po&s;itively de|clare, were I to expire this In&s;tant, I have no &s;elf-intere&s;ted Views, in Regard to worldly Matters; but confe&s;s my&s;elf a Mi&s;er in my Wi&s;hes &s;o far, as having the tran&s;cendant Joy of knowing that I am re&s;tor'd to a Happine&s;s, which not only will clear my Reputation to the World, in Regard to a former Want of Duty, but, at the &s;ame Time, give a convinc|ing Proof that there are yet &s;ome Sparks of Tenderne&s;s remaining in my Father's Bo&s;om, for his REPENTANT CHILD.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, I believe I came not only an un|expected, but an unwelcome Gue&s;t into the amily, (exclu&s;ive of my Parents,) as my Mother had borne no Children for &s;ome few Years before; &s;o that I was rather regarded
<PB N="16" REF="16">
as an impertinent Intruder, than one who had a natural Right to make up the circular Number of my Father's Fire-Side: Yet, be it as it may, the Jealou&s;y of me, from her other Children, laid no Re&s;traint on her Fondne&s;s for me, which my Father and &s;he both te&s;ti|fied in their tender Care of my Education. His paternal Love omitted nothing that could improve any natural Talents Heaven had been pleas'd to endow me with; the Mention of which, I hope, won't be imputed to me as a vain Self-conceit, of knowing more, or thinking better, than any other of my Si&s;ter Females. No! far be it from me; for as all Advantages from Nature are the favourable Gifts of the Power Divine, con&s;equently no Prai&s;e can be arrogated to our&s;elves, for that which is not in our&s;elves POSSIBLE TO BE|STOW.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not have made this Remark, but, as 'tis likely my Works may fall into the Hands of People of di&s;proportion'd Under|&s;tandings, I was willing to prevent an Error a weak Judgment might have run into, by in|con&s;iderately throwing an Odium upon me, I could not po&s;&s;ibly de&s;erve&mdash;FOR, ALAS! ALL CANNOT JUDGE ALIKE.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="17">
As I have in&s;tanc'd, that my Education was not only a genteel, but in Fact a liberal one, and &s;uch indeed as might have been &s;uffi|cient for a Son in&s;tead of a Daughter; I mu&s;t beg Leave to add, that I was never made much acquainted with that nece&s;&s;ary Uten&s;il which forms the hou&s;wifely Part of a young Lady's Education, call'd a Needle; which I handle with the &s;ame clum&s;ey Awkwardne&s;s a Monkey does a Kitten, and am equally capable of u&s;ing the one, as Pug is of nur&s;ing the other.</P>
<P>This is not much to be wonder'd at, as my Education con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in Studies of va|rious Kinds, and gave me a different Turn of Mind than what I might have had, if my Time had been employ'd in ornamenting a Piece of Canvas with Bea&s;ts, Birds and the Alphabet; the latter of which I under&s;tood in <HI>French,</HI> rather before I was able to &s;peak <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>As I have promis'd to conceal nothing that might rai&s;e a Laugh, I &s;hall begin with a &s;mall Specimen of my former Madne&s;s, when I was but four Years of Age. Hav|ing, even then, a pa&s;&s;ionate Fondne&s;s for a Perriwig, I crawl'd out of Bed one Sum|mer's Morning at <HI>Twickenham,</HI> where my
<PB N="18" REF="18">
Father had Part of a Hou&s;e and Gardens for the Sea&s;on, and, taking it into my &s;mall Pate, that by Dint of a Wig and a Wai&s;tcoat, I &s;hould be the perfect Repre&s;entative of my Sire, I crept &s;oftly into the Servants-Hall, where I had the Night before e&s;pied all Things in Order, to perpetrate the happy De&s;ign I had framed for the next Morning's Expedition. Accordingly I paddled down Stairs, taking with me my Shoes, Stockings, and little Dimity Coat; which I artfully contrived to pin up, as well as I could, to &s;upply the Want of a Pair of Breeches. By the Help of a long Broom, I took down a Wai&s;tcoat of my Brother's, and an enormous bu&s;hy Tie-wig of my Father's, which entirely en|clos'd my Head and Body, with the Knots of the Ties thumping my little Heels as I march'd along, with &s;low and &s;olemn Pace. The Covert of Hair in which I was con|ceal'd, with the Weight of a mon&s;trous Belt and large Silver-hilted Sword, that I could &s;carce drag along, was a va&s;t Impediment in my Proce&s;&s;ion: And, what &s;till added to the other Inconveniencies I labour'd under, was whelming my&s;elf under one of my Father's large Beaver-hats, laden with Lace, as thick and broad as a Brickbat.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="19">
Being thus accoutred, I began to con&s;ider that 'twould be impo&s;&s;ible for me to pa&s;s for Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> in Girl's Shoes, therefore took an Opportunity to &s;lip out of Doors after the Gardener, who went to his Work, and roll'd my&s;elf into a dry Ditch, which was as deep as I was high; and, in this Grote&s;que Pigmy-State, walk'd up and down the Ditch bowing to all who came by me. But, behold, the Oddity of my Appearance &s;oon a&s;&s;embled a Croud about me; which yielded me no &s;mall Joy, as I conceiv'd their Ri&s;ibility on this Occa&s;ion to be Marks of Approbation, and walk'd my&s;elf into a Fever, in the happy Thought of being taken for the 'Squire.</P>
<P>When the Family aro&s;e, 'till which Time I had employ'd my&s;elf in this regular March in my Ditch, I was the fir&s;t Thing enquir'd after, and mi&s;s'd; 'till Mrs. <HI>Heron,</HI> the Mother of the late celebrated Actre&s;s of that Name, happily e&s;pied me, and directly call'd forth the whole Family to be Witne&s;s of my State and Dignity.</P>
<P>The Drollery of my Figure render'd it im|po&s;&s;ible, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Fondne&s;s of both Father and Mother, to be angry with me; but, alas! I was borne off on the Footman's
<PB N="20" REF="20">
Shoulders, to my Shame and Di&s;grace, and forc'd into my proper Habiliments.</P>
<P>The Summer following our Family re&s;ided at <HI>Hampton-Town,</HI> near the Court. My Mother being indi&s;pos'd, at her fir&s;t coming there, drank every Morning and Night A&s;&s;es Milk. I ob&s;erved one of tho&s;e little health-re&s;toring Animals was attended by its Fole, which was about the Height of a &s;izeable Grey|hound.</P>
<P>I immediately form'd a Re&s;olution of fol|lowing the Fa&s;hion of taking the Air early next Morning, and fix'd upon this young A&s;s for a Pad-nag; and, in order to bring this Matter to bear, I communicated my De&s;ign to a &s;mall Troop of young Gentlemen and Ladies, who&s;e low Births and adver&s;e States render'd it entirely convenient for them to come into any Scheme, Mi&s;s <HI>Charlotte Cibber</HI> could po&s;&s;ibly propo&s;e. Accordingly my Mother's Bridle and Saddle were &s;ecretly pro|cur'd, but the riper Judgments of &s;ome of my Followers &s;oon convinc'd me of the un|nece&s;&s;ary Trouble of carrying the Saddle, as the little de&s;tin'd Bea&s;t was too &s;mall, and in|deed too weak, to bear the Burden; upon which 'twas concluded to take the Bridle only, and away went Mi&s;s and her Attendants,
<PB N="21" REF="21">
who &s;oon arrived at the happy Field where the poor harmle&s;s Creature was &s;ucking. We &s;oon &s;eiz'd, and endeavour'd to bridle it; but, I remember, 'twas impo&s;&s;ible to bring that Point to bear, the Head of the Fole being &s;o very &s;mall, the Trappings fell off as fa&s;t as they &s;trove to put them on. One of the &s;mall Crew, who was wi&s;er than the re&s;t, propos'd their Garters being converted to that U&s;e; which was &s;oon effected, and I rode triumphantly into Town a&s;tride, with a numerous Retinue, who&s;e Huzzas were drown'd by the dreadful Braying of the tender Dam, who pur&s;ued with agonizing Sounds of Sorrow, for her oppre&s;s'd young one.</P>
<P>Upon making this Grand-Entry into, the Town, I remember my Father, from the violent Acclamations of Joy on &s;o glorious an Occa&s;ion, was excited to enquire into the Meaning, of what he perhaps imagin'd to be an In&s;urrection; when, to his Amazement, he beheld his Daughter mounted as before de&s;cribed, preceded by a Lad, who &s;crap'd upon a Twelve-penny Fiddle of my own, to add to the Dignity and Grandeur of this ex|traordinary Enterprize.</P>
<P>I perfectly remember, young as I was then, the &s;trong Mixture of Surprize, Plea&s;ure, Pain
<PB N="22" REF="22">
and Shame in his Countenance, on his view|ing me &s;eated on my infantical <HI>Ro&s;inante;</HI> which, tho' I had not then Sen&s;e enough to di&s;tingui&s;h, my Memory has &s;ince afforded me the Power to de&s;cribe, and al&s;o to repeat his very Words, at his looking out of Window, <HI>Gad demme! An A&s;s upon an A&s;s!</HI></P>
<P>But, alas! how momentary are &s;ometimes the Tran&s;ports of the mo&s;t Happy? My Mother was not quite &s;o pa&s;&s;ive in this Ad|venture, as in that before related; but rather was, as I thought, too active: For I was no &s;ooner di&s;mounted then I underwent the Di&s;cipline of Birch, was mo&s;t &s;hamefully taken Pri&s;oner, in the Sight of my Attendants, and with a &s;mall Packthread my Leg was made the &s;ad Companion with that of a large Table.</P>
<Q>"O! Fall of Honour!"</Q>
<P>'Tis not to be conceived, the violent Indig|nation and Contempt my Di&s;grai&s;e rais'd in my Infant-Brea&s;t; nor did I forgive my Mother, in my Heart, for &s;ix Months after, tho' I was oblig'd to ask Pardon in a few Moments of her, who, at that Time, I conceiv'd to be mo&s;t in Fault.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="23">
Were I to in&s;ert one quarter Part of the &s;trange, mad Pranks I play'd, even in Infancy, I might venture to affirm, I could &s;well my Account of 'em to a Folio, and perhaps my whim&s;ical Head may compile &s;uch a Work; but I own I &s;hould be loth, upon Reflection, to publi&s;h it, le&s;t the Contagion &s;hould &s;pread it&s;elf, and make other young Folks as ridicu|lous and mi&s;chievous as my&s;elf. Tho' I can't charge my Memory with &s;uffering other People to feel the ill Effects of my unaccountable Vagaries; except once, I remember, a cro&s;s, old Woman at <HI>Richmond</HI> having beat me, I revenged my&s;elf, by getting &s;ome of my Play-fellows to take as many as they could of her Caps, and other &s;mall Linnen that hung in the Garden to dry, and who fent 'em &s;ailing down a Brook that forc'd its Current to the <HI>Thames,</HI> whil&s;t I walk'd into the Parlour, &s;ecretly pleas'd with the Thoughts of my Revenge.</P>
<P>This is the only Piece of Malice that occurs to my Remembrance; but I have too much Rea&s;on to know, that the Madne&s;s of my Follies have generally very &s;everely recoil'd upon my&s;elf, but in nothing &s;o much as in the &s;hocking and heart-wounding Grief for my Father's Di&s;plea&s;ure, which I &s;hall not
<PB N="24" REF="24">
impudently dare deny having ju&s;tly incurr'd: But I dare confidently affirm, MUCH PAINS has been taken to AGGRAVATE MY FAULTS, and STRENGTHEN his Anger; and, in that Ca&s;e, I am certain my Enemies have not al|ways too &s;trictly adher'd to TRUTH, but MEANLY had recour&s;e to FALSHOOD to per|petrate the Ruin of a haple&s;s Wretch, who&s;e real Errors were &s;ufficient, without the Addition of MALICIOUS SLANDERS. The Per&s;ons I mean, who did me the&s;e unfriendly Offices, are &s;till in Being: But, <HI>Qui Capit ille Facit.</HI></P>
<P>I formerly wrote to my Father, as I thought it an incumbent Duty to enquire after his Health, and, at the &s;ame Time, implore his Pardon; but could never have the Happine&s;s of even a di&s;tant Hope of obtaining it. For the fore-mention'd Rea&s;ons I flatter my&s;elf, as Reflection and Contrition have brought me to a ju&s;t Sen&s;e of all pa&s;t Failings, HU|MANITY will plead her Right in his RELENTING HEART, and once again re|&s;tore me to a Joy which none can conceive, who never felt the Pain ari&s;ing from the Di&s;grace of being deem'd an Alien from the Family, in which they originally drew Breath.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="25">
My Obligations to him in my bringing up are of &s;o exten&s;ive a Nature, I can never &s;uf|ficiently acknowledge 'em; for, notwith&s;tanding 'tis every Parent's Duty to breed their Children with every Advantage their Fortunes will ad|mit of, yet, in this Ca&s;e, I mu&s;t confe&s;s my|&s;elf mo&s;t tran&s;cendantly indebted, having re|ceived even a Superfluity of tender Regard of that Kind; and, at the &s;ame Time, beg Pardon for not having put it to a more grateful and generous U&s;e, both for HIS HONOUR and MY OWN CREDIT.</P>
<P>However, I &s;hall lay it down as a Maxim for the remaining Part of Life, to make the utmo&s;t Amends by PRUDENT CONDUCT, for the MISCARRIAGES OF THE FORMER; &s;o that, &s;hould I fail in my Hopes, I may not draw any further Imputation on my&s;elf, by not endeavouring to de&s;erve, what I think &s;o particularly my Duty, if po&s;&s;ible, to archieve.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed in my Account. At eight Years of Age I was placed at a famous School in <HI>Park-Street, We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> governed by one Mrs. <HI>Draper,</HI> a Woman of great Sen&s;e and Abilities, who employed a Gentleman, call'd Mon&s;ieur <HI>Flahaut,</HI> an excellent Ma&s;ter of
<PB N="26" REF="26">

Among the Number of his Pupils, I had the Happi|ne&s;s of being one; and, as he di&s;covered in me a tolerable Genius, and an earne&s;t De&s;ire of Improvement, he advi&s;ed my Mother, in a Vi&s;it to me at School, to let him teach me <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Italian,</HI> which &s;he, proud of hearing me capable of receiving, readily con|&s;ented to.</P>
<P>Nor was my Tutor &s;atisfied with tho&s;e Branches of Learning alone, for he got Leave of my Parents to in&s;truct me in Geography; which, by the Bye, tho' I know it to be a mo&s;t u&s;eful and plea&s;ing Science, I cannot think it was altogether nece&s;&s;ary for a Female: But I was delighted at being thought a learned Per&s;on, therefore readily acquie&s;ced with my Preceptor's Propo&s;al.</P>
<P>Accordingly I was furni&s;h'd with proper Books, and two Globes, caele&s;tial and terre&s;|trial, borrow'd of my Mother's own Brother, the late <HI>John Shore,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Serjeant-Trumpet of <HI>England;</HI> and pored over 'em, 'till I had like to have been as mad as my Uncle, who has given a mo&s;t demon&s;trative Proof of his being &s;o for many Years, which I &s;hall here|after mention.</P>

The va&s;t Application to my Study almo&s;t di&s;tracted me, from a violent De&s;ire I had to make my&s;elf perfect Mi&s;tre&s;s of it.

<P>After I had received, in two Years &s;chool|ing, a con&s;iderable Share of my Education (in which Mu&s;ick and Singing bore their Parts) I was, thro' my indulgent Parents Fondne&s;s, allow'd Ma&s;ters at Home to fini&s;h my Studies.</P>

<P>Was not this &s;ufficient to murder the Fame of the able&s;t Phy&s;ician in the Univer&s;e?

<P>It happened that Day proved very rainy, which put it into my &s;trange Pate to gather up all the Snails in the Garden; of which, from the heavy Shower that had fallen, there was a &s;uperabundant Quantity. I immediately

Boiling the re&s;t to a Con&s;i&s;tence, with &s;ome green Herbs and Mutton Fat, I made an Ointment; and, clapping conceited Labels upon the Phial and Gallipot, &s;ent my Preparation, with a joyous Bottle of Hart&s;horn and <HI>Sal Volatile</HI> I purloined from my Mother, to add a Grace to my Pre&s;criptions.</P>
<P>In about three Days Time the good Woman came hopping along, to return me Thanks for the extream Benefit &s;he had received; intreat|ing my Goodne&s;s to repeat the Medicines, as &s;he had found &s;uch wonderful Effects from their Virtues.</P>
<P>But Fortune was not quite kind enough to afford me the Means of granting her Reque&s;t at that Time; for the friendly Rain, which had enabled me to work this wonderful Cure, was &s;ucceeded by an extream Drought, and I thought it highly nece&s;&s;ary to &s;u&s;pend any fur|ther Attempts to e&s;tabli&s;h my great Reputa|tion, 'till another watry Opportunity offered to furni&s;h me with tho&s;e Ingredients, who&s;e &s;anative Qualities had been &s;o u&s;eful to her Limbs and my Fame: I therefore di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her with a Word of Advice, not to tamper too

<P>My being unfortunately deprived of the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Widow's Shop to carry on this grand Affair, made me &s;oon tire in the Pur&s;uit, and put me upon &s;ome other Expe|dient for my Amu&s;ement; I therefore framed the tendere&s;t Excu&s;es I could po&s;&s;ibly invent to drop my Practice, that tho&s;e who had before thought them&s;elves indi&s;pen&s;ibly obliged to me, might not conceive I had lo&s;t that cha|ritable Di&s;po&s;ition which they had &s;o often ble&s;&s;ed me for; and which, indeed, I heartily regretted the not having Power &s;till to pre&s;erve and maintain.</P>
<P>My next Flight was Gardening, a very plea&s;ing and healthful Exerci&s;e, in which I pa&s;t the mo&s;t Part of my Time every Day.

<P>It luckily happened for me that my Father was gone to <HI>France,</HI> and the Servant who was in the Capacity of Groom and Gardener, having the Misfortune one Afternoon to be violently inebriated, took it in his Head to abu&s;e the re&s;t of his Fellow-Servants; which my Mother hearing, interfered, and &s;hared equally the In&s;olence of his opprobrious

<P>But what Imagination can paint the Extra|vagance of Joy I felt on this happy Acqui&s;i|tion!

<P>The Rumour of the Man's Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion was &s;oon &s;pread, and reached, to my great Unea&s;i|ne&s;s, to <HI>Uxbridge,</HI> and every little adjacent Village; upon which I &s;oon found it nece&s;&s;ary to change my Po&s;t of Gardener, and became, for very near a Week, Porter at the Gate, le&s;t &s;ome lucky Mortal might have been intro|duced, and deprived me of the happy Situation I enjoyed.</P>
<P>I began to be tired with giving Denials, and, in order to put an End to their fruitle&s;s Expectations, gave out that we had received,

Letters from <HI>France,</HI> to a&s;&s;ure us, that my Papa had po&s;itively hired a Man at <HI>Peris</HI> to &s;erve in that Office, and therefore all fu|ture Attempts would be needle&s;s on that Ac|count.</P>

<P>One Day, upon my Mother's paying me a Vi&s;it in the Garden, and approving &s;omething I had done there, I re&s;ted on my Spade, and, with a &s;ignificant Wink and a Nod, ask'd, Whether &s;he imagined any of the re&s;t of her Children would have done as much at my Age? adding, very &s;hrewdly, <HI>Come, come, Madam; let me tell you, a 'Pound &s;aved is a Pound got:</HI> Then proceeded in my Office

<P>I mu&s;t not forget to inform the Reader, that my Mother had no extraordinary Opinion of the Fellow's Hone&s;ty whom &s;he had turned away; and, what confirmed it, was tracing his Foot&s;teps under the Chamber-Windows the Night after his Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, and the Neigh|bours had ob&s;erved him to have been hover|ing round the Hou&s;e &s;everal Hours that very Evening.</P>
<P>As we had a con&s;iderable Quantity of Plate, my Mother was a good deal alarmed with an Apprehen&s;ion of the Man's attempting to break in at Midnight; which might render us not only liable to be robbed, but murdered. She communicated her Fears to me, who mo&s;t he|roically promi&s;ed to protect her Life, at the utmo&s;t Hazard of my own. Accordingly I de&s;ired all the Plate might be gathered up, and had it placed in a large Flasket by my Bed&s;ide. This was no &s;mall Addition to my Happine&s;s, as it gave me an Opportunity of rai&s;ing my Reputation as a couragious Per&s;on,
<PB N="45" REF="45">
which I was extream fond of being deemed; and, in Order to e&s;tabli&s;h that Character, I &s;tripp'd the Hall and Kitchen of their Fire-Arms, which con&s;i&s;ted of my own little Carbine (I had, through the old Maid's Per&s;wa&s;ion, been barbarou&s;ly dive&s;ted of not long before) a heavy Blunderbu&s;s, a Mu&s;catoon, and two Brace of Pi&s;tols, all which I loaded with a Couple of Bullets each before I went to Bed; not with any De&s;ign, on my Word, to yield to my Repo&s;e, but ab&s;olutely kept awake three long and tedious Hours, which was from Twelve to Three, the Time I thought mo&s;t likely for an Inva&s;ion.</P>
<P>But no &s;uch Thing happened, for not a Mortal approached, on which I thought my&s;elf undone; 'till a friendly Dog, who barked at the Moon, gave a happy Signal, and I bounc'd from my Repo&s;itory with infinite Obligations to the Cur, and fir'd out of the Window Piece after Piece, re-charging as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, 'till I had con&s;umed about a Pound of Powder, and a proportionable Quantity of Shot and Balls.</P>
<P>'Tis not to be &s;uppo&s;ed but the Family was, on my fir&s;t On&s;et in this &s;ingular Battle (having nothing to combat but the Air) &s;oon alarm'd. The frequent Reports and violent

Explo&s;ions encouraged my kind Prompter to this Farce, to change his lucky Bark into an ab&s;olute Howl, which &s;trongly cor|roborated with all that had been thought or &s;aid, in Regard to an Attempt upon the Hou&s;e. My trembling Mother, who lay Half expiring with dreadful Imaginations, rang her Bell; which Summons I in&s;tantly obey'd, firmly a&s;&s;uring her, that all Danger was over, for that I heard the Villain decamp on the fir&s;t Firing; which Decampment was neither more nor le&s;s than the Ru&s;tling of the Trees, occa&s;ioned by a windy Night, for the Fellow was ab&s;olutely gone to <HI>London</HI> the very Morning I declared War again&s;t him, as was afterwards proved.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding I was fully convinced I had nothing to conquer, but my unconquer|able Fondne&s;s and Re&s;olution to acquire the Character of a couragious Per&s;on, I &s;ettled that Point with the whole Family, in begging 'em not to be under the lea&s;t Apprehen&s;ion of Danger; urging, that my con&s;tant firing would be the Means of preventing any: And bid 'em con&s;ider, that the Lo&s;s of Sleep, was not to be put in Competition with the Hazard of their Lives.</P>

This Reflection made them perfectly ea&s;y, and me entirely happy; as I had an unlimitted Power, without Interruption, once in ten Minutes to wa&s;te my Ammunition to no Purpo&s;e: And retiring to my Re&s;t, as &s;oon as my Stock was exhau&s;ted, enjoy'd in Dreams a &s;econd Idea of my glorious Ex|ploits.</P>
<P>'Tis certain, nothing but my Mother's ex|ce&s;&s;ive Fondne&s;s could have blinded her Rea&s;on, to give in to my unprefidented, ridiculous Follies; as &s;he was, in all other Points, a Woman of real good Sen&s;e: But where the Heart is PARTIALLY ENGAGED, we have frequent In&s;tances of its clouding the Under&s;tanding, and MAKING DUPES O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> THE WISEST.</P>
<P>I &s;hall add one unfortunate Circum&s;tance more, and then proceed to give an Account of my Marriage with Mr. <HI>Richard Charke;</HI> who&s;e Memory will, by all Lovers of Mu&s;ick who have heard his incomparable Performance on the Violin, be held in great E&s;timation. But to my Story&mdash;I had received In|formation, that there was a very fine young Hor&s;e to be di&s;po&s;ed of at <HI>Uxbridge,</HI> qualified to draw a Chai&s;e; and, having heard my
<PB N="48" REF="48">
Father &s;ay, before he went to <HI>France,</HI> he would purcha&s;e another when he came Home, I flew with di&s;tracted Joy to the Man's Hou&s;e, where this Hor&s;e was to be &s;een; and accordingly had him harne&s;&s;ed, and put to. This Excur&s;ion was entirely unknown to my Mother; who, at that Time, lay ex|treamly ill of the A&s;thma.</P>
<P>The Owner of the Hor&s;e, knowing my Family, and &s;eeing me often drive my Father's Hor&s;es, made no Doubt but that I was &s;ent in Fact to make Tryal of his; and, being willing to make his Market as quick as po&s;&s;ible, got the Hor&s;e and Chai&s;e ready in a few Minutes, and out I &s;et, at the extream Hazard of my Neck, when I got upon <HI>Ux|bridge</HI> Common: For the Creature was very young and ungovernable, and dragg'd me and the Chai&s;e over Hills and Dales, with &s;uch Vehemence, I de&s;paired of ever &s;eeing <HI>Hillingdon</HI> again. However, the &s;ubtle Devil, knowing his Way Home, &s;et up a barbarous full Gallop, and made to his Ma&s;ter's Hou&s;e with dreadful Expedition, beyond my Power to re&s;train; and, in the Cart-rut, ran over a Child of three Years of Age, that lay &s;prawl|ing there for its unfortunate Amu&s;ement.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="49">
The violent Rapidity of his Cour&s;e luckily prevented the Death of the Child, but was very near effecting mine; for Grief and Sur|prize took &s;uch hold of my Spirits, I became &s;peechle&s;s. The Child was &s;oon brought after me by the Parents, attended by a nu|merous Mob; and, as &s;oon as I regained my Speech, I order'd the Infant to be ex|amined by a Surgeon: But no Harm being done, more than a &s;mall Graze on the Neck, the Affair was made up with a Shilling and a Shoulder of Mutton.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this happy Acquittance from &s;o terrible a Di&s;a&s;ter (as ignorant People are naturally fond of &s;triking Terror) &s;ome doubly-indu&s;trious Courier, who had more Expedition than Brains, ran with the News to my Mother of my having kill'd a Child, which threw her into &s;uch agonizing Frights, as greatly hazarded her Life; and, for &s;ome Time, was an Aggravation to the Illne&s;s &s;he laboured under: For though I came Home as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and convinced her of the Error of the &s;tupified Wretch that had &s;o cruelly alarmed her, the Surprize and Shock &s;o &s;trongly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her, 'twas with Difficulty &s;he retained her Sen&s;es.</P>

This Misfortune threw me into a Kind of Melancholly, that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted as long as could be expected from one of my Youth and volatile Spirits; and, to the extream Surprize of the Neighbourhood, Mi&s;s <HI>Charlotte</HI> became for a little while, I believe, rather &s;tupidly dull, than ju&s;tly reflecting: For I don't remember any Impre&s;&s;ion left on my Mind by this Accident after my Mother's Recovery, and the A&s;&s;urance I had of the Boy's being living and well. However, it put a Period to the Fertility of my mi&s;|chievous Genius; and, upon being &s;oon after acquainted with Mr. <HI>Charke,</HI> who was plea&s;ed to &s;ay &s;oft Things, and flatter me into a Belief of his being an humble Admirer, I, as fooli&s;h young Girls are apt to be too credulous, believed his Pa&s;&s;ion the Re&s;ult of real Love, which indeed was only Intere&s;t. His Affairs being in a very de&s;perate Con|dition, he thought it no bad Scheme to endeavour at being Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>'s Son-in-Law, who was at that Time a Patentee in <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> Theatre, and I in the happy Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my Father's Heart; which, had I known the real Value of, I &s;hould never have be&s;towed a Moment's Thought in the obtaining Mr. <HI>Charke</HI>'s, but pre&s;erving my Father's.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="51">
Alas! I thought it a fine Thing to be married, and indulged my&s;elf in a pa&s;&s;ionate Fondne&s;s for my Lover; which my Father perceiving, out of pure Pity, tenderly con|&s;ented to a conjugal Union: And the Reader may &s;uppo&s;e that I thought, at that Time, 'twas the greate&s;t Favour he ever conferred on me, as indeed I really did; but I have &s;ome mode&s;t Rea&s;ons to believe, had he indulged me under the Guardian&s;hip of &s;ome &s;en&s;ible tru&s;ty Per&s;on to have taken a &s;mall Tour into the Country, without letting me know 'twas done with a De&s;ign to break off my Attach|ment to my then intended Husband, it would have prevented the Match, and both Parties, in the Main, might have been better plea&s;ed; for I am certain that Ab&s;ence, and an ea&s;y Life, would &s;oon have got the better of the Violence of my Fondne&s;s, being then of too indolent a Di&s;po&s;ition to let any Thing long di&s;turb my Mind.</P>
<P>I don't advance this as a Reproach for my Father's Indulgence, but to give the Reader a perfect Idea of the Oddity of my youthful Di&s;po&s;ition; for, as Sir <HI>Charles Ea&s;y</HI> &s;ays to his Lady, <HI>He is often rude and civil with|out De&s;ign:</HI> The &s;ame Inadvertency had an equal Dominion over me, and I have avoided

or committed Errors, without any Premedita|tion either to offend or oblige.</P>
<P>But to my Tale&mdash;After &s;ix Months Ac|quaintance I was, by Con&s;ent, e&s;pou&s;ed at St. <HI>Martin</HI>'s Church to Mr. <HI>Charke,</HI> and thought at that Time the Mea&s;ure of my Happine&s;s was full, and of an ever-during Na|ture: But, alas! I &s;oon found my&s;elf deceived in that fond Conceit; for we were both &s;o young and indi&s;creet, we ought rather to have been &s;ent to School than to Church, in Regard to any Qualifications on either Side, towards rendering the Marriage-State comfort|able to one another. To be &s;ure, I thought it gave me an Air of more Con&s;equence to be call'd Mrs. <HI>Charke,</HI> than Mi&s;s <HI>Charlotte;</HI> and my Spou&s;e, on his Part, I believe, thought it a fine Feather in his Cap, to be Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>'s Son-in-Law: Which indeed it would have proved, had he been skilful enough to have managed his Cards rightly, as my Father was greatly inclined to be his Friend, and en|deavoured to promote his Intere&s;t extreamly among&s;t People of Quality and Fa&s;hion. His Merit, as a Proficient in Mu&s;ick, I believe is inconte&s;tible; and, being tolerably agreeable in his Per&s;on, both concurr'd to render him the general Admiration of tho&s;e Sort of Ladies, who, regardle&s;s of their Reputations,
<PB N="53" REF="53">
make 'em the unhappy Sacrifices to every plea&s;ing Object: Which, <HI>entre nous,</HI> was a mo&s;t horrible Bar in my E&s;chutcheon of Content; in&s;omuch, that married Mi&s;s was, the fir&s;t Twelvemonth of her connubial State, indu&s;triou&s;ly employed in the Pur&s;uit of fre&s;h Sorrow, by tracing her Spou&s;e from Morn to Eve through the Hundreds of <HI>Drury.</HI></P>
<P>I had, indeed, too often very &s;hocking Con|firmations of my Su&s;picions, which made me at la&s;t grow quite indifferent; nor can I avoid confe&s;&s;ing, that Indifference was &s;trongly at|tended with Contempt. I was in Hopes that my being ble&s;t with a Child would, in &s;ome Degree, have &s;urmounted that unconquerable Fondne&s;s for Variety, but 'twas all one; and, I firmly believe, nothing but the Age of <HI>Me|thu&s;elah,</HI> could have made the lea&s;t Altera|tion in his Di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>This loo&s;e and unkind Behaviour, con|&s;equently made me extravagant and wild in my Imagination; and, finding that we were in the &s;ame Circum&s;tances, in Regard to each other, that Mr. <HI>Sullen</HI> and his Wife were, we agreed to part. Accordingly I made our Infant my Care, nor did the Father's Neglect render me carele&s;s of my Child; for I really was &s;o fond of it, I thought my&s;elf more
<PB N="54" REF="54">
than amply made Amends for his Follies, in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her.</P>
<P>When Mr. <HI>Charke</HI> thought proper he paid us a Vi&s;it, and I received him with the &s;ame good Nature and Civility I might an old, decay'd Acquaintance, that I was certain came to ask me a Favour; which was often the Ca&s;e, for I &s;eldom had the Honour of his Company but when Ca&s;h run low, and I as con&s;tantly &s;upplied his Wants; and have got from my Father many an auxiliary Guinea, I am certain, to purcha&s;e my&s;elf a new Pair of Horns.</P>
<P>When I married 'twas in the Month of <HI>February,</HI> the Beginning of Benefit-time at both Theatres. Mrs. <HI>Thurmond</HI>'s coming on &s;oon, who under&s;tood that I was de&s;igned for the Stage the Sea&s;on following, reque&s;ted that I might make my fir&s;t Appearance on her Night, in the Character of <HI>Mademoi&s;elle,</HI> in <HI>The Provok'd Wife:</HI> And, I particularly re|member, the fir&s;t Time of my playing, was the la&s;t in which that matchle&s;s Performer, Mrs. <HI>Oldfield,</HI> ever charm'd the Town with her inimitable Exhibition. She &s;icken'd &s;oon after, and linger'd 'till <HI>October</HI> following, when &s;he expired; to the inexpre&s;&s;ible Lo&s;s of her Acquaintance in general, and all Connoi&s;&s;eurs
<PB N="55" REF="55">
in Acting: Tho', I am apt to think, had &s;he &s;urvived that Illne&s;s, the Stage would not have been le&s;s liable to have &s;u&s;tained her Lo&s;s, as &s;he had acquir'd a con&s;iderable Fortune, and was in the Decline of Life; but, in her Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;till in the utmo&s;t Height of Per|fection.</P>
<P>This excellent Actre&s;s, from her Encourage|ment, gave me lively Hopes of Succe&s;s; and, being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a youthful Tran&s;port, was rendered quite in&s;en&s;ible of tho&s;e Fears, which naturally attend People on their fir&s;t E&s;&s;ay on the Theatre.</P>
<P>My Father and Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>'s Approba|tion, was no trifling Addition to my Self|conceit. 'Tis true, I was happy in a Genius for the Stage; but I have, &s;ince my riper Years, found that the Succe&s;s I met with was rather owing to indulgent Audiences, that good-naturedly encouraged a young Creature, who, they thought, might one Day come to &s;omething, than any real Judgment I had in my Profe&s;&s;ion; and that I was more indebted to Chance than I was aware on, for the Ap|plau&s;e I received, when I accidently &s;tumbled on the Right.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="56">
I mu&s;t beg Leave to give the Reader an Idea of that Extacy of Heart I felt, on &s;eeing the Character I was to appear in the Bills; though my Joy was &s;omewhat da&s;h'd, when I came to &s;ee it in&s;erted, <HI>By a young Gentle|woman, who had never appear'd on any Stage before.</HI> This melancholly Di&s;appoint|ment, drew me into an unavoidable Expence in Coach-hire, to inform all my Acquaintance, that I was the Per&s;on &s;o &s;et down in Mrs. <HI>Thurmond</HI>'s Benefit-Bills: Though my Father's prudent Concern intended it to be a Secret, 'till he had Proof of my Abilities.</P>
<P>To my inexpre&s;&s;ible Joy, I &s;ucceeded in the Part, and the Play was in about &s;ix Weeks after re-cho&s;en for the Benefit of Mr. <HI>Charke</HI> and Mi&s;s <HI>Raftor,</HI> now Mrs. <HI>Clive,</HI> who was then a young, but promi&s;ing Actre&s;s; of which &s;he has given demon&s;trative Proofs, in various Lights, therefore &s;hall not expatiate on that Subject, le&s;t the Weakne&s;s of my Pen &s;hould fall &s;hort of her Merit.</P>
<P>My Name was in Capitals on this &s;econd Attempt; and I dare aver, that the Peru&s;al of it, from one End of the Town to the other, for the fir&s;t Week, was my mo&s;t immediate and con&s;tant Bu&s;ine&s;s: Nor do I believe it co&s;t me

le&s;s, in Shoes and Coaches, then two or three Guineas, to gratify the extravagant Delight I had, not only in reading the Bills, but &s;ome|times hearing my&s;elf &s;poken of, which luckily was to my Advantage; nor can I an&s;wer for the &s;trange Effect a contrary Report might have wrought, on a Mind &s;o giddily loaded with conceited Tran&s;port&mdash;I'm not quite certain, whether my Folly and Indignation might not have cau&s;ed a Drawn-Battle on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>It happened that Mrs. <HI>Horton,</HI> who played Lady <HI>Fanciful</HI> the Time before, was indi&s;|po&s;ed, and my Si&s;ter-in-Law, the late Mrs. <HI>Jane Cibber,</HI> was appointed to do the Part; who, notwith&s;tanding her having been a few Years on the Stage, and indeed a meritorious Actre&s;s, had not overcome the Shock of ap|pearing the fir&s;t Night in any Character. I, who was a&s;toni&s;hed at her Timidity, like a &s;trange Gawky as I was, told her I was &s;ur|prized at her being frighted, who had &s;o often appeared; when I, who had never played but once, had no Concern at all. <HI>That's the very Rea&s;on,</HI> &s;aid &s;he; <HI>when you have &s;tood as many Shocks as others have done, and are more acquainted with your Bu&s;ine&s;s, you'll po&s;&s;ibly be more &s;u&s;ceptible of Fear.</HI> The Apprehen&s;ions &s;he laboured under, gave her a
<PB N="58" REF="58">
grave A&s;pect, which my in&s;en&s;ible Head at that Time took as an Affront; and, I remem|ber, I turned &s;hort on my Heel, as we were waiting for our Cue of Entrance, and broke off our Conver&s;ation, nor could I bring my|&s;elf, but on the Stage, to &s;peak to her the whole Evening.</P>
<P>This ridiculous Circum&s;tance we have both laughed at &s;ince, and I found her Words very true; for I'll maintain it, the be&s;t Players are the mo&s;t capable of Fear, as they are naturally mo&s;t exact in the Nicety of their Performance. Not that I would in&s;inuate, by this Ob&s;erva|tion, that I think my&s;elf better than in the common Run of tho&s;e theatrical Gentry, who are lucky enough to be endured through the Cour&s;e of a Play, without being wi&s;hed to be no more &s;een, after the Fir&s;t Act.</P>
<P>Such melancholly In&s;tances I have been Witne&s;s of, both in Town and Country; WHILST THE POOR PLAYER HAS BAWL|ED AND BELLOWED OUT HIS MINUTE ON THE STAGE, AND THE GROANING AUDIENCE HISSINGLY ENTREATED, HE MIGHT BE HEARD NO MORE.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Character I appeared in was <HI>Alicia,</HI> and found the Audience not le&s;s in|dulgent

than before. Mrs. <HI>Porter</HI>'s Misfor|tune, of being over-turned in her Chai&s;e at <HI>Highwood-Hill,</HI> was the Means by which I was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that Part. The third was the <HI>'Di&s;tre&s;s'd Mother,</HI> in the Summer, when the young Company were under my Brother <HI>Theo|philus Cibber</HI>'s Direction.</P>
<P>Now I leave to any rea&s;onable Per&s;on, what I went through, in undertaking two &s;uch Characters, after two of the greate&s;t Actre&s;&s;es in the Theatre, <HI>viz.</HI> Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> and Mrs. <HI>'Porter.</HI> By this Time I began to FEEL I FEARED; and the Want of it was &s;ufficiently paid home to me, in the Tremor of Spirits I &s;uffered in &s;uch daring Attempts: However, Fortune was my Friend, and I e&s;caped with Life; for I &s;olemnly declare, that I expected to make an odd Figure in the Bills of Morta|lity&mdash;DIED ONE, OF CAPITAL CHA|RACTERS.</P>
<P>Soon after this <HI>George Barnwell</HI> made his Appearance on the Stage, in which I was the original <HI>Lucy;</HI> and, beginning to make Act|ing my Bu&s;ine&s;s as well as my Plea&s;ure, the Succe&s;s I had in that Part rai&s;ed me from Twenty to Thirty Shillings <HI>per</HI> Week: After which, having the good Fortune to be &s;elected from the re&s;t of the Company as Stock-Reader
<PB N="60" REF="60">
to the Theatre, in Ca&s;e of Di&s;a&s;ters, I acquit|ted my&s;elf tolerably to the Satisfaction of the Ma&s;ters and Audience.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t Attempt of that Kind was <HI>Cleopa|tra,</HI> for the Benefit of Mr. <HI>Wor&s;dale,</HI> who was honoured with the Pre&s;ence of His Royal Highne&s;s the late Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI> Mrs. <HI>He|ron</HI> having that Afternoon the Misfortune to brui&s;e her Knee-pan, &s;he was immoveable; and I was, at the &s;econd Mu&s;ick, &s;ent for to read the Part.</P>
<P>Had I been under Sentence of Death, and St. <HI>Sepulchres</HI> dreadful Bell tolling for my la&s;t Hour, I don't conceive I could have &s;uf|fered much greater Agony, and thought of my Si&s;ter's Words to &s;ome Tune; for I ab&s;o|lutely had not a Joint or Nerve I could com|mand, for the whole Night: And, as an Addition to the Terror I laboured under, Mr. <HI>Quin,</HI> THAT WORTHY VETERAN OF THE STAGE, played <HI>Ventidius.</HI> The Ap|prehen&s;ion I laboured under in re&s;pect to the Audience, which was a numerous one, to the Amount of Three Hundred and odd Pounds, was nothing in Compari&s;on to the Fright his A&s;pect threw me into.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="61">
But even this Shock I got through, and was &s;oon after inducted to a &s;econd of the &s;ame Nature. Mrs. <HI>Butler</HI> was taken ill, and the Queen in <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was to be filled up: Ac|cordingly, I was &s;ent for to &s;upply the Defi|ciency; which, in Ju&s;tice to the Memory of the deceas'd Gentlewoman, I mu&s;t inform the Reader &s;he rewarded me for, by &s;ending me, in a very polite Manner, a Couple of Guineas next Morning. I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, I did not think it worth &s;o hand&s;ome an Acknowledge|ment; but &s;he &s;ent in &s;uch a Manner that, had I refu&s;ed it, I mu&s;t have been guilty of a very great Ab&s;urdity, as her Station and mine at that Time were upon very different Footings, I being but a Babby in the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and &s;he an e&s;tabli&s;hed Per&s;on of a very good Salary.</P>
<P>I continued for that Sea&s;on at the before|mentioned Revenue; but, upon Mr. <HI>High-more</HI>'s making a Purcha&s;e in the Theatre, there immediately happened a Revolt of the greate&s;t Number of the Company to the New Theatre in the <HI>Hay-Market.</HI> My Brother being principally concerned, I al&s;o made a Decampment; and was, by Agreement, rai&s;ed from Thirty Shillings to Three Pounds, had a very good Share of Parts, and continued with

them 'till the whole Body returned to Mr. <HI>Fletewood,</HI> who for &s;ome Time carried on the Bu&s;ine&s;s with great Indu&s;try, attended with proportionable Succe&s;s; though, poor Gen|tleman, I fear that &s;uper-extraordinary Succe&s;s was the Foundation of his Ruin.</P>
<P>It happened he and I had a Di&s;pute about Parts, and our Controver&s;y aro&s;e to &s;uch a Height, I, without the lea&s;t Patience or Con|&s;ideration, took a <HI>French</HI> Leave of him, and was idle enough to conceive I had done a very meritorious Thing. I cannot &s;ay, in the Af|fair, he u&s;ed me entirely well, becau&s;e he broke his Word with me; but I u&s;ed my&s;elf much wor&s;e in the Main by leaving him, as I have &s;ince experienced. As there are too many bu&s;y Medlars in the World, who are ever ready to clinch the Nail of Sedition, when once 'tis &s;truck; &s;o &s;ome particular Peo|ple thought it worth while, by villainous Fal&s;hoods, to blow the Spark of Fire be|tween Mr. <HI>Fletewood</HI> and my&s;elf into a bar|barous Blaze, in&s;omuch that I was provoked to write a Farce on the Occa&s;ion, entitled, <HI>The Art of Management;</HI> wherein the Rea|der may be a&s;&s;ured I took no &s;mall Pains to &s;et him in a mo&s;t ridiculous Light, and &s;pared not to utter &s;ome Truths which, I am &s;en&s;ible, ought rather to have been concealed: And

I cannot but own, I have &s;ince felt &s;ome &s;ecret Compunction on that Score; as he, notwith|&s;tanding my impertinent and &s;tupid Revenge, at my Father's Reque&s;t, re&s;tored me to my former Station.</P>
<P>What further aggravates my Folly and In|gratitude, I made, even then, but a &s;hort Stay with him, and joined the late <HI>Henry Field|ing,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who, at that Time, was Manager at the <HI>Hay-Market</HI> Theatre, and running his Play, called, <HI>Pa&s;quin,</HI> the eleventh Night of which I played the Part of Lord <HI>Place;</HI> which, 'till then, had been performed by Mr. <HI>Richard Yates:</HI> But as he had other Parts in that Piece, Mr. <HI>Fielding</HI> begged the Favour of him to &s;pare that to make room for me, and I was accordingly engaged at Four Guineas <HI>per</HI> Week, with an Indulgence in Point of Charges at my Benefit, by which I cleared Sixty Guineas; and walked with my Pur&s;e in my Hand 'till my Stock was exhau&s;ted, le&s;t I &s;hould forget the Nece&s;&s;ity I then laboured under, of &s;quandering what might have made many a decayed Family truly happy.</P>
<P>As I &s;tand Self-convicted for all the Follies I have been guilty of, I hope my Behaviour to Mr. <HI>Fletewood</HI> will &s;ix no Imputation, that may not be removed; and the le&s;s &s;o, as I

might &s;ay to him from the Origin of our Quarrel, with <HI>Peachum,</HI></P>
<Q REND="margQuotes">"BROTHER, BROTHER, WE WERE BOTH IN THE WRONG."</Q>
<P>My Motive for leaving him the &s;econd Time, proceeded from a Cau&s;e he had no Share in; which, I confe&s;s, is a farther Ag|gravation to my Ingratitude. I can only ac|knowledge my Error, and beg Pardon for the Folly; and, at the &s;ame Time, apologize for my Concealment of the Rea&s;on of my &s;econd Elopement, as 'twas partly a Family-Concern, though perhaps I might be condemned, were I to reveal it: But, notwith&s;tanding I've done a Thou&s;and unaccountable Things, I cannot ab&s;olutely think my&s;elf blameable for that la&s;t Project, farther than in u&s;ing a Gentleman ill, who had behaved to me agreeable to that Character, when he might have taken any Ad|vantages again&s;t me, without being thought guilty of Inhumanity or Inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Soon after <HI>Pa&s;quin</HI> began to droop, Mr. <HI>Lillo,</HI> the Author of <HI>George Barnwell,</HI> brought Mr. <HI>Fielding</HI> a Tragedy of Three Acts, called, <HI>The Fatal Curio&s;ity,</HI> taken from a true tragic Tale of a Family at <HI>Penryn,</HI> in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> who lived in the Reign of King

<HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t. In this Play are two well-drawn Characters, under the Denominations of old <HI>Wilmot</HI> and his Wife <HI>Agnes,</HI> an aged Pair; who had, from too much Ho&s;pitality on the Husband's Part, and unbounded Pride on the Wife's, out-run a va&s;t E&s;tate, and were re|duced to extreame&s;t Poverty.</P>
<P>The late Mr. <HI>John Roberts,</HI> a very judi|cious Speaker, di&s;covered a Ma&s;ter&s;hip in the Character of the Husband, and I appeared in that of the Wife. We were kindly received by the Audience; the Play had a fre&s;h Run the Sea&s;on following; and, if I can obtain a Grant for ONE NIGHT ONLY, I intend to make my Appearance once more as Mrs. <HI>Agnes,</HI> for my own Benefit, at the <HI>Hay-Market</HI> Theatre; on which Occa&s;ion, I hum|bly hope the Favour and Intere&s;t of my wor|thy Friends.</P>
<P>At the Time I was engaged with Mr. <HI>Fielding,</HI> I lodged in <HI>Oxendon-Street,</HI> and boarded with my Si&s;ter <HI>Brett,</HI> who was but an Inmate as well as my&s;elf; but I, and my little Daughter, &s;welled up the Number of her Family.

The&s;e curious Lines were, for nineteen Years, pre&s;erved by my fooli&s;h, fond Si&s;ter; who, in her Turn, has been a univer&s;al Friend to her Brethren, or rather her Si&s;ter|hood. I wi&s;h Fortune had been le&s;s ri|gourous, and Gratitude more predominant; that the former might have prevented, or the latter have been the tender Motive to a&s;&s;wage tho&s;e Sorrows and Inconveniencies of Life, &s;he at pre&s;ent labours under: From which, as far as &s;he has a Claim in me, and my poor Capacity extends, I'll make it the Bu&s;ine&s;s of my Life to extricate her; as I have, when Fortune was in her Power, been a Participater of her Bounty.</P>
<P>I don't make this De&s;ign publick with any Regard to my&s;elf, but with the plea&s;ing Hope of being the happy Example to others, from whom &s;he may have an equal Claim, both from NATURE AND GRATITUDE. Poor Thing! &s;he is now in the five and fiftieth Year of her Age; and, as &s;he has had no Faults the Family can alledge again&s;t her, 'tis Pity but &s;he &s;hould be tenderly con&s;idered by 'em all, that the remaining Part of Life may pa&s;s away without tho&s;e corroding Cares, that are too often the Impediment to our ca&s;t|ing our Thoughts beyond the pre&s;ent State;

which, alas! is the &s;ad and dreadful Con&s;e|quence of a FORGETFULNESS AND DIS|REGARD OF THE FUTURE.</P>
<P>I don't apprehend that to be my unhappy Si&s;ter's Ca&s;e, for I'm certain her Rea&s;on and good Sen&s;e can never be reduced to &s;uch a Stupefaction; yet the &s;tronge&s;t Intellects, and mo&s;t re&s;olute Minds, may po&s;&s;ibly be van|qui&s;h'd in &s;ome Degree, by an oppre&s;&s;ive Load of Angui&s;h, and uninterrupted Hours of Care.</P>

my Reader, when I removed from my airy Man&s;ion before-de&s;cribed, I took it into my Head to dive into TRADE. To that End, I took a Shop in <HI>Long-Acre,</HI> and turn'd Oil-woman and Grocer.</P>
<P>This new Whim proved very &s;ucce&s;sful, for every Soul of my Acquaintance, of which I have a numerous Share, came in Turn to &s;ee my mercantile Face; which carried in it as conceited an Air of Trade as it had before in Phy&s;ick, and I talk'd of my&s;elf and other DEALERS, as I was plea&s;ed to term it. The Ri&s;e and Fall of Sugars was my con&s;tant Topick; and Trading, Abroad and at Home, was as frequent in my Mouth as my Meals. To compleat the ridiculous Scene, I con&s;tantly took in the Papers to &s;ee how Matters went at <HI>Bear-Key;</HI> what Ships were come in, or lo&s;t; who, in our Trade, was broke; or who adverti&s;ed Teas at the lowe&s;t Prices: Ending with a Comment upon tho&s;e Dealers, who were endeavouring to under-&s;ell us; &s;hrewdly progno&s;ticating their never being quiet, 'till they had rendered the Article of Tea a meer Drug; and THAT I, AND MANY MORE OF THE BUSINESS, &s;hould be obliged entirely to give it up. An Injury to Traffick in general! that mu&s;t be al|lowed.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="71">
I mu&s;t beg Leave, gentle Reader, to tell you, that my Stock perhaps did not exceed ten or a dozen Pounds at a Time of each Sort; but that furni&s;hed me with as much Di&s;cour&s;e, as if I had the whole Lading of a Ship in my Shop. Then, as to Oils, to be &s;ure the famous <HI>Nobbs,</HI> and Fifty more, were not to be put in Competition with mine for their Excellence; and, though I &s;eldom kept above a Gallon of a Sort in the Hou&s;e, I carried on the Farce &s;o far as to write to Country Chap|men to deal with me.</P>
<P>Then I con&s;idered, 'till I had e&s;tabli&s;hed a univer&s;al Trade, I'd &s;ave, for the fir&s;t Year, the Expence of an Out-rider, as I was a very good Hor&s;ewoman, and go the Journies my|&s;elf; concluding, with a &s;ignificant Nod, that Money was as well in my own Pocket as another's.&mdash;But, providentially for me, I could gain no Country Cu&s;tomers; for, as the Ca&s;e &s;tood, I mu&s;t po&s;itively have let 'em had the Goods con&s;iderably to my own Lo&s;s: And, as a Proof, will relate a Cir|cum&s;tance that occurred to me, in the &s;ell|ing a Quarter of a Hundred of Lump-Sugar to a good-natur'd Friend, who came to buy it for no other Rea&s;on, but that I &s;old it.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="72">
'Tis cu&s;tomary, in buying of Sugars by the Hundred, to be allowed a Tret of &s;ix Pounds <HI>extra.</HI> I was &s;o in&s;ufferably proud of hear|ing &s;o large a Quantity demanded by my Friend, that I really forgot the Character of Grocer, and, fancying my&s;elf the Sugar-Baker, allow'd in the twenty-five Pounds the Half of what I got in the Hundred; alledging, that 'twas our Way, when People dealt for large Quantities, to make an Allowance over and above the common Weight.</P>
<P>My Friend, who knew no better than my|&s;elf, promi&s;ed me all the Cu&s;tom &s;he could bring; which, if &s;he had been as good as her Word, might in due Cour&s;e of Time have paved the Way for me either to <HI>New|gate,</HI> the <HI>Fleet,</HI> or <HI>Mar&s;hal&s;ea.</HI></P>
<P>After my Friend was gone with her Bar|gain, I began (as I thought Trade encrea&s;ing) to think it proper to purcha&s;e a large Pair of Scales to weigh by Hundreds, and a large Beam to hang 'em on; and &s;et out next Morning to that Purpo&s;e, traver&s;ing through <HI>Drury-Lane, Holborn, Fleet-Ditch,</HI> &amp;c. but, meeting with nothing to my Mind, returned Home, with a Re&s;olution to have a Pair made.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="73">
The good Woman who kept the Hou&s;e, upon hearing I had been endeavouring to make this needle&s;s Purcha&s;e, made bold to enquire into the Nece&s;&s;ity of it: Upon which I told her, what had happened the Day before; and mentioned, as a Proof of my Knowledge of Trade, the Advantage I allowed to my Friend. She for &s;ome Time left me amazed at her Meaning, while &s;he was almo&s;t &s;trangled with laughing at my Folly.</P>
<P>When &s;he came to her&s;elf, I gravely asked where the Joke lay, and what mighty Won|der there was in my having an encrea&s;ing Trade, who had &s;uch a univer&s;al Acquaint|ance? As &s;oon as &s;he was able to convince me of the Error I had committed, in giving one Half of the Over-weight in a Quarter of a Hundred, which was allowed in a whole Hundred only, I began to drop my Jaw, and looked as fooli&s;h as any rea&s;onable Per&s;on may &s;uppo&s;e, on &s;o ridiculous an Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Links and Flambeaux are a Commodity be|longing to the Oil-Trade, at lea&s;t generally &s;old in Shops of that Kind, and con&s;tant and large Demands I had for both: But I remem|ber, in particular, one of tho&s;e nocturnal Il|luminators, who are the nece&s;&s;ary Conductors
<PB N="74" REF="74">
for tho&s;e who don't chu&s;e Chairs or Coaches, came every Night ju&s;t before Candle-time, which is the dusky Part of the Evening, the mo&s;t convenient Light for perpetrating a wicked Intent, as will be proved in the Sequel of my Story.</P>
<P>To be &s;ure I thought my&s;elf infinitely obliged to the &s;ooty-colour'd Youth for u&s;ing my Shop, and was mighty proud of his Hand|&s;el every Evening; and &s;ometimes, as I dealt in &s;piritous Liquors, treated him with a Dram, and many Thanks for his own, and other Gentlemens Cu&s;tom, of his Profe&s;&s;ion. The arch Villain &s;miled, and expre&s;&s;ed great Satisfaction that even, in his poor Way, he had the Power of &s;erving his good Mi&s;tre&s;s. He bow'd, and I curt&s;ey'd; 'till, walking Backwards out of my Shop, he had com|plemented me out of every Bra&s;s Weight I had in it.</P>
<P>He had not been gone five Minutes, ere I had Occa&s;ion to make u&s;e of &s;ome of 'em; when, to my great Amazement and Confu&s;ion, not one was to be found. Unluckily for me, they were piled up one within the other, and injudiciou&s;ly placed in the Corner of the Window next the Door, quite pat to his Pur|po&s;e: And he was really &s;o perfect a Ma&s;ter
<PB N="75" REF="75">
of his Art in Filching, that, notwith&s;tanding the great Ceremony that pa&s;&s;ed between us from the Upper-End of the Shop to the Lower, he went off entirely undi&s;covered in his Villainy.</P>
<P>I need not tell the Reader 'twas the la&s;t Interview we ever had, 'till I (to his great Misfortune) &s;aw him making a &s;mall Tour in a two-wheel'd Coach from <HI>Newgate</HI> to <HI>Ty|burn;</HI> a College where many an indu&s;trious 'Squire, like him&s;elf, have frequently and de&s;ervedly taken their Degrees.</P>
<P>This &s;econd <HI>Fracas</HI> &s;o clo&s;ely pur&s;uing the former, I had &s;ome &s;ecret Thoughts of &s;hut|ting up my Shop for ever, to conceal my Misfortunes and Di&s;grace; though I altered my Mind for that Time, but, I think, in about three Months after I po&s;itively threw it up, at a Hundred Pounds Stock, all paid for, to keep &agrave; grand Puppet-Show over the <HI>Tennis-Court,</HI> in <HI>James-Street,</HI> which is licenced, and which is the only one in this Kingdom that has had the good Fortune to obtain &s;o advantageous a Grant.</P>
<P>When I fir&s;t went into my Shop, I was horribly puzzled for the Means of &s;ecuring my Effects from the Power of my Husband;
<PB N="76" REF="76">
who, though he did not live with me, I knew had a Right to make bold with any Thing that was mine, as there was no for|mal Article of Separation between us: And I could not ea&s;ily brook his taking any Thing from me to be profu&s;ely expended on his Mi&s;tre&s;s, who lived no farther from me than the Hou&s;e next to the Coach-Maker's, in <HI>Great Queen's-Street,</HI> and was Si&s;ter to the famous Mrs. <HI>Sally K&mdash;g,</HI> one of the Ladies of the HIGHEST IRREPUTABLE REPUTA|TION at that Time, in or about <HI>Covent-Garden.</HI> However, to prevent any Danger, I gave and took all Receipts ('till Mr. <HI>Charke</HI> went to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> where he died in about twenty Months after his leaving <HI>England)</HI> in the Name of a Widow Gentlewoman, who boarded with me, and I &s;at quiet and &s;nug with the plea&s;ing Reflection of my Security, though he &s;u&s;pected I had a Hand in the Plot.</P>
<P>But he did not &s;tay long enough to trouble me on that Score, for his Lady was one Day unfortunately arre&s;ted for a Hundred Pounds, as they &s;at <HI>T&ecirc;te &agrave; T&ecirc;te</HI> at Dinner: And he, to &s;how his Gallantry, went directly into the City and immediately purcha&s;ed her Redemp|tion, by taken up that Sum of the Merchants, who were Agents for the Gentleman he went
<PB N="77" REF="77">
over with; and whom, 'till then, he left in Uncertainty whether he would go or not.</P>
<P>It was concerted between this happy Pair, that Madam &s;hould follow; and, I &s;uppo&s;e, pa&s;s in the <HI>Indies</HI> for his Wife, which &s;he had my Leave to do, though &s;he were a Lady.</P>
<P>As I have, among many other Cen&s;ures, laboured under that of being a giddy, indi&s;|creet Wife, I mu&s;t take this Opportunity of referring my&s;elf to the &s;uperior Judgment of tho&s;e who read my Story; whether a young Creature, who actually married for Love (at lea&s;t I thought &s;o; nay, was fooli&s;h enough to think my&s;elf equally beloved) mu&s;t not naturally be incen&s;ed, when, in le&s;s than a Month after Marriage, I received the mo&s;t demon&s;trative Proofs of Di&s;regard, where I ought to have found the greate&s;t Tenderne&s;s; To be even to my Face, apparently convinc'd of his in&s;atiate Fondne&s;s for a Plurality of com|mon Wretches, that were to be had for Half a Crown. This, con&s;equently, rai&s;ed in me both Aver&s;ion and Contempt; and, not hav|ing Years enough to afford me much Reflec|tion, nor Patience &s;ufficient to &s;it down like Lady <HI>Ea&s;y,</HI> contented with my Wrongs, 'till
<PB N="78" REF="78">
Experience might by Chance have made him wi&s;er.</P>
<P>Had he entertained a reciprocal Affection for me, he had, when I married him, &s;o ab|&s;olute a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my Heart, 'twas in his Power to have moulded my Temper as he thought fit; but the ungrateful Returns my Fondne&s;s met with could not fail of the un|happy Effects, of a growing Di&s;regard on my Side.</P>
<P>I was in Hope the Birth of my little Girl might have made &s;ome Impre&s;&s;ion on his Mind, but 'twas the &s;ame Thing after as before it; nor did he make the lea&s;t Provi&s;ion for either of us, when he went Abroad. 'Tis true, I was then in <HI>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields</HI> Playhou&s;e, and from thence engaged at a good Salary with the late Mr. <HI>Fielding;</HI> but then I was as liable to Death or Infirmities as any other Part of the Creation, which might have di&s;empower'd me from getting my own, or my Child's bread.</P>
<P>Pray what was to become of us then? I laboured under the melancholly Circum&s;tance, of being newly under my Father's Di&s;plea&s;ure, and con&s;equently no Redre&s;s to be hoped or expected from that Quarter, which he very
<PB N="79" REF="79">
well knew; and, as I have been &s;ince inform|ed, was one of the principal Sowers of Sedi|tion betwixt us: Though, at the &s;ame Time, he would explode my Father behind his Back, and condemn him to me, for the very Things he had partly urged him to.</P>
<P>However, though he did not chu&s;e to be a HUSBAND or a FATHER, he proved him&s;elf a SON, by making an A&s;&s;ignment of Twenty Pounds a Year, during his Life, to his Mo|ther; who con&s;tantly made it her Practice to be one of the Party with him and his Lady, and very confidently come from them to my Apartment, and give me a Hi&s;tory of the Chat of the Day that had pa&s;&s;ed between them.</P>
<P>But Peace to his <HI>Manes!</HI> and, I hope Heaven has forgiven him, as I do from my Soul; and wi&s;h, for both our &s;akes, he had been Ma&s;ter of more Di&s;cretion, I had then po&s;&s;ibly been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more Prudence.</P>
<P>About a Year before he went to the <HI>Indies,</HI> I had the Misfortune to lo&s;e my dear Mother, otherwi&s;e I &s;hould not have undergone that Perturbation of Mind I &s;uffered, from his not leaving any Thing, in Ca&s;e of Accidents, for mine and the Child's Support; as my Mo|ther's
<PB N="80" REF="80">
Tenderne&s;s would have made us equally her Care, in any Exigence that might have occurred to me. But, alas! &s;he was gone, to my Sorrow, even to the pre&s;ent Minute in which I mention her; and &s;hall ever revere her Memory, as is quite incumbent on me, for her inexpre&s;&s;ible Fondne&s;s and tender Re|gard for me, to the late&s;t Moment of her Life.</P>
<P>This dear Woman was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every per&s;onal Charm, that could render her attrac|tive and aimable. Her Conque&s;t over my Fa|ther, was by a Vi&s;it he made to her late Brother, whom I have before mentioned; and, as he pa&s;&s;ed by the Chamber, where &s;he was accompanying her own Voice on the Harp&s;ichord, his Ear was immediately charm|ed, on which he begged to be introduced, and, at fir&s;t Sight, was captivated. Nor, as I hear, was &s;he le&s;s delighted with the Spright|line&s;s of his Wit, than he was with the Fund of Perfection with which Art and Nature had equally endowed her. In &s;hort, a private Court&s;hip began, and ended in a Marriage again&s;t her Father's Con&s;ent, as Mr. <HI>Colley Cibber</HI> was then rather too young for a Hus|band, in the old Gentleman's Opinion, he not coming to Age 'till after (as I have been told) the Birth of his &s;econd Child: But not|with&s;tanding
<PB N="81" REF="81">
my Grandfather, in the End, gave her a Fortune, and intended a larger, but this Marriage made him convert the intended additional Sum to another U&s;e; and, in Re|venge, built a <HI>Folly</HI> on the <HI>Thames,</HI> called <HI>Shore's-Folly,</HI> which was demoli&s;hed &s;ome Years before I was born.</P>
<P>Her Father's Family, exclu&s;ive of her Chil|dren, is now entirely extinct, by the Death of my Uncle; who, poor Man, had the Misfor|tune to be ever touched in his Brain, and, as a convincing Proof, married his Maid, at an Age when he and &s;he both had more Occa&s;ion for a Nur&s;e than a Par&s;on.</P>
<P>We have Proof po&s;itive of his being inca|pable of making a Will that can &s;tand good; for which Rea&s;on I am determined, as being one of the Heirs at Law, to have a Trial of Skill with the ancient Lady, and &s;ee whether a proper Appeal to the Court of <HI>Chancery</HI> won't be the happy Means of &s;etting a&s;ide a mad Man's Will, and make Way for tho&s;e who have a more legal and ju&s;tifiable Claim to his Effects, than an old Woman, who&s;e utmo&s;t Merit con&s;i&s;ted in being his Servant. I am only a&s;toni&s;hed they have let her alone &s;o long, but I promi&s;e her &s;he &s;hall not find me quite &s;o pa&s;&s;ive&mdash;and that right &s;oon.</P>

Then, in regard to my Cloaths, I &s;pared for no Co&s;t to make them &s;plendidly magnificent, and the Scenes were agreeable to the re&s;t.</P>
<P>This Affair &s;tood me in &s;ome Hundreds, and would have paid all Co&s;ts and Charges, if I had not, through exce&s;&s;ive Fatigue in ac|compli&s;hing it, acquired a violent Fever, which had like to have carried me off, and con&s;equently gave a Damp to the Run I &s;hould otherwi&s;e have had, as I was one of the prin|cipal Exhibiters for tho&s;e Gentry; who&s;e Mouths were, like many others we have &s;een MOVE without any Reality of Utterance, or at lea&s;t &s;o unintelligible in the Attempt, they might as well have clo&s;ed their Lips, without rai&s;ing an Expectation they were unlucky enough to di&s;appoint, whether ORATORS or PLAYERS, is not material: But as I have my&s;elf been lately admitted into the Number
<PB N="83" REF="83">
of the former, and from my Youth helped to fill up the CATALOGUE of the latter, I hope no Exceptions will be taken, as the Cap may as rea&s;onably fit my&s;elf, as any other of either Profe&s;&s;ion; though I mu&s;t beg Leave to hint, however deficient I, or &s;ome of my Co|temporaries may be, EVERY TRAGICK PLAYER, AT LEAST, SHOULD BE AN ORATOR.</P>
<P>'Tis no Complement to Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI> to &s;ay, HE IS BOTH; con&s;equently Encomiums are needle&s;s to prove, what the nice&s;t Judges have, for &s;ome few Years pa&s;t, been &s;o plea&s;ingly convinced of.</P>
<P>'Tis, I own, natural and nece&s;&s;ary to apolo|gize for di&s;gre&s;&s;ing from a Subject; but, I hope, when the Reader con&s;iders the Merit of the Per&s;on who occa&s;ion'd it, I may, in the Eye of Rea&s;on and Judgment, &s;tand excu&s;ed. Perhaps, as Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> is a Per&s;on who many may undoubtedly wi&s;h to pay their Court to, this Remark may be deemed Adula|tion; but I mu&s;t beg their Pardons, and a&s;&s;ure them, they would, in that Point, be guilty of a very great Error, for I am the la&s;t Creature in the World to be picked out for that Piece of Folly: Nay, I think &s;o meanly of it, as to &s;et it down as Servility,
<PB N="84" REF="84">
which I heartily contemn; and have been often blamed for a too Openne&s;s of Temper, that has &s;ometimes hazarded the Lo&s;s of a Friend.</P>
<P>In Regard to the above-mention'd Gentle|man, there is not any Mortal breathing, that enjoys the Benefit of Hearing and of Sight, but mu&s;t receive infinite Delight from his Performance, though they &s;hould be ever &s;o indifferent to him, when off the Stage. But that is not my Ca&s;e; I have received &s;ome Acts of Friend&s;hip from him, therefore of Cour&s;e mu&s;t revere him as a Benefactor, and am proud of this Opportunity to make him a publick Acknowledgement.</P>
<P>'Tis certain, there never was known a more unfortunate Devil than I have been; but I have, in the Height of all my Sorrows, hap|pily found a numerous Quantity of Friends, who&s;e Commi&s;eration &s;hall be taken Notice of with the utmo&s;t Gratitude, before I clo&s;e this Narrative. Now, ON TO THE AFFAIRS OF STATE.</P>
<P>When I quitted the <HI>Tennis-Court,</HI> I took a Hou&s;e, in <HI>Mar&s;ham-Street, We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and lived very privately for a little while; 'till I began to con&s;ider, that my wooden Troop
<PB N="85" REF="85">
might as well be put in Action, and determined to march to <HI>Tunbridge-Wells</HI> at the Head of them. When I arrived, there was a General who had taken the Field before me; one <HI>Lacon,</HI> a famous Per&s;on, who had for many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Years, and indeed, very &s;ucce&s;sfully, entertained the Company with tho&s;e inanimate Heroes and Heroines: I therefore was obliged to &s;ound a Retreat, and content my&s;elf with confining my Forces, and fighting again&s;t <HI>Lacon</HI> in <HI>Propria Per&s;ona,</HI> at <HI>A&s;hley</HI>'s Great Room.</P>
<P>I had living Numbers &s;ufficient to play two or three of our thine&s;t Comedies; and our only Tragedy we had to our Backs was <HI>George Barnwell,</HI> which I play'd for my own Benefit the la&s;t Night, and &s;et out next Morning for <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>When I arrived there, I began to con&s;ider which Way I &s;hould turn my&s;elf. Being then out of the Hou&s;es, and in no Likelihood of future Re&s;toration, I re&s;olved to make the be&s;t U&s;e I could of my Figures, without fatiguing my&s;elf any farther, and lett my Comedians out for Hire to a Man, who was principally concerned in the Formation of them: But Bu&s;ine&s;s not an&s;wering his Ends and my Ex|pectations, I &s;old, for twenty Guineas, what
<PB N="86" REF="86">
co&s;t me near five hundred Pounds. Another Proof of my Di&s;cretion! and, indeed, of the Hone&s;ty of the Purcha&s;er, that knew the origi|nal Expence of them, and the Reality of their Worth: But as I have condemn'd him for taking the Advantage of my Nece&s;&s;ity, &s;hall conceal his Name; and hope he'll have Mode&s;ty enough, if this Paragraph &s;hould be read to him, (by &s;ome who knew the Affair,) to add one Sin more, in denying that he was the Per&s;on.</P>
<P>I even gave him the Privilege, as I had a Licence, to make u&s;e of that and my Name; which now, when ever I think proper (as I &s;hall never exhibit any Thing that can po&s;&s;ibly give Offence) &s;hall always employ Mr. <HI>Yeates,</HI> who is a skillful Per&s;on, and one who has made it his Bu&s;ine&s;s from his Youth upwards.</P>
<P>As 'tis very po&s;&s;ible I may entertain the Town with &s;ome unaccountable Oddity of that Kind very &s;hortly, tho&s;e that like to laugh I know will encourage me; and, I am cer|tain, there is none in the World MORE FIT THAN MYSELF TO BE LAUGH'D AT. I confe&s;s my&s;elf an odd Mortal, and believe I need no Force of Argument, beyond what has been already &s;aid, to bring the whole Globe terre&s;trial into that Opinion.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="87">
It has been hinted (and indeed luckily came to my Ear,) that I &s;hould never have Patience to go through the Proce&s;s of my Life. I don't &s;uppo&s;e tho&s;e who could advance &s;uch a Piece of Folly in me could po&s;&s;ibly be my Friends, and am &s;orry for their Want of Humanity, as this Work is at pre&s;ent the Staff of my Life; and &s;uch an In&s;inuation mu&s;t naturally deter many from taking it in, if they &s;uppo&s;e me capable of &s;uch an In|con&s;i&s;tency: So far from it, that were I, by Miracle, capable of riding in my own Coach, I would &s;till pur&s;ue my Scheme, 'till I had brought it to a Conclu&s;ion; for, a happy Change of Circum&s;tances makes</P>
<Q>"Misfortunes pa&s;t prove Stories of Delight;"</Q>
<P>And what now is my SUPPORT, would then be my AMUSEMENT.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;trange! but true! let People u&s;e the mo&s;t hone&s;t Endeavours to &s;upport them&s;elves, there is generally &s;ome ridiculous Mortal that, without Rhime or Rea&s;on, and for the &s;ake of &s;aying &s;omething, without any real Views of Good or Ill, are often detrimental to the In|du&s;trious or Oppre&s;&s;ed. Be it as it may, 'tis an Error, I fear, INVINCIBLE and HURT|FUL
<PB N="88" REF="88">
TO BOTH; and &s;ure, unprovoked to offer an Injury, is UNPARDONABLE! If the contrary were the Ca&s;e, 'tis NOBLER FAR to OVER-LOOK THAN RESENT; but, as I have no Rea&s;on to believe that I have offended, I hope for the future no Per&s;on will be in|di&s;creet enough to a&s;&s;ert that for a TRUTH, which Time will prove to be a real FALS|HOOD.</P>
<P>Not long after I had parted from what might really, by good Management, have brought me in a very comfortable Sub&s;i&s;tance, and in a genteel Light, I was addre&s;&s;ed by a worthy Gentleman (being then a Widow) and clo&s;ely pur&s;ued 'till I con&s;ented to an honour|able, though very &s;ecret Alliance; and, in Compliance to the Per&s;on, bound my&s;elf by all the Vows &s;incere&s;t Friend&s;hip could in&s;pire, never to confe&s;s who he was. Gratitude was my Motive to con&s;ent to this Conjunction, and extream Fondne&s;s was his Inducement to re|que&s;t it. To be &s;hort, he &s;oon died; and, unhappily for me, not only from &s;u&s;taining the Lo&s;s of a valuable and &s;incere Friend, but by the unexpected Stroke of Death, I was de|prived of every Hope and Means of a Sup|port.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="89">
As I have overcome all the Inconveniencies of Life this terrible Shock of Fate rendered me liable to, I am contented, and think my|&s;elf happy; but not even the mo&s;t inexplicable Sorrows I was immers'd in ever did, nor &s;hall any Motive whatever make me break that Vow I made to the Per&s;on, by a Di&s;|covery of his Name.</P>
<P>This was a Means indeed, by which I hoped to have &s;ecured my&s;elf far above tho&s;e Di&s;tre&s;&s;es I have known; but, alas! proved the FATAL CAUSE OF ALL. I was left in|volved with Debts I had no Means of pay|ing; and, through the villainous In&s;tigation of a wicked drunken Woman, was arre&s;ted for &s;even Pounds, when, as Heaven &s;hall judge me, I did not know where to rai&s;e as many Pence.</P>
<P>The Officer who had me in Cu&s;tody, on hearing my Story, really compa&s;&s;ionated me, and was exceeding angry at the Woman; who, without Cau&s;e, worked up the Creditor to believe I had a Fortune of five Hundred <HI>per Annum</HI> left me, which was not in the Power of the Decea&s;ed to leave; nor as the Affair was a Secret, and Death &s;udden, any Probability of &s;uch a Happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="90">
This Misfortune was occa&s;ioned fir&s;t by the Stupidity and Cruelty of the Woman, and effected by Dint of a very hand&s;ome lac'd Hat I had on, being then, for &s;ome &s;ub&s;tantial Rea&s;ons, EN CAVALIER; which was &s;o well de&s;cribed, the Bailiff had no great Trouble in finding me.</P>
<P>Undoubtedly I was extream happy, when he told me his Bu&s;ine&s;s! Having nothing in View but the <HI>Mar&s;hal&s;ea,</HI> the Gates of which I thought, though at that Time in the Middle of <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> &s;tood wide open for my Reception: But as the Man had Humanity, he ea&s;ed me of tho&s;e Fears; and, by Dint of a trifling Favour, conferr'd by poor Mrs. <HI>Elizabeth Carele&s;s,</HI> (who&s;e Name will, I believe, be for &s;ome Years in Remembrance) I was &s;et at Large, 'till Matters could be ac|commodated.</P>
<P>'Tis not to be expre&s;&s;ed, the Tran&s;port I felt on his leaving me behind him with Mrs. <HI>Carele&s;s,</HI> and her good-natur'd Friend; who, being an Attorney, was incapable of becoming my Bail, but compa&s;&s;ionated my Di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;ent me directly to Mr. <HI>Mytton,</HI> who kept the <HI>Cro&s;s-Keys,</HI> reque&s;ting him to do that friendly Office for me; and &s;ent by me a
<PB N="91" REF="91">
Note of Indemnification, which Mr. <HI>Mytton</HI> could on no Means make any Exceptions to, as the Gentleman was a Per&s;on of Worth and Honour; and be&s;ides, a particular good Cu&s;tomer to the other.</P>
<P>The next Thing was to procure another Bail, to join with the former. I &s;oon ob|tained one, who&s;e good Nature was ea&s;ily excited to do a kind Action; but, when I went to the Officer and told who it was, Objections were made again&s;t him, as he was obliged him&s;elf to keep clo&s;e, for fear of an equal Di&s;a&s;ter; and, to convince me of his Danger, produced a Writ which had been two or three Times renewed, to no Pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>What to do in this terrible Exigence I could not tell, as I had but a Day and a Half longer to be at Large, if I could not produce a &s;econd Bail. I tried all Means, but in vain; and, on the <HI>Friday</HI> following, was obliged to &s;urrender, and lay that Night in <HI>Jack&s;on's-A&s;ley,</HI> at the Officer's Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I had not been there Half an Hour, before I was &s;urrounded with all the Ladies who kept Coffee-Hou&s;es in and about the <HI>Garden,</HI> each offering Money for my Ran&s;om: But no|thing
<PB N="92" REF="92">
then could be done, without the Debt and Co&s;ts; which, though there was, I be|lieve, about a dozen or fourteen Ladies pre&s;ent, they were not able to rai&s;e. As far as their Finances extended, they made an Offer of 'em; and would have given Notes jointly or &s;eparately, for the Relief of poor Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> as they were plea&s;ed to &s;tile me. 'Tis true, the Officer would willingly have come into their kind Propo&s;itions, as he was truly &s;en&s;ible of my Indigence; but, being clo&s;ely watched by the Creditor, who would, on no Terms be brought to any Compo&s;ition, all their Efforts were ineffectual.</P>
<P>After two or three Hours wa&s;ted in fruitle&s;s Entreaties, it growing late, they left me to bewail the terrible Scene of Horror that pre|&s;ented to my tortured View; and, with a Heart over-charged with Angui&s;h, and hope|le&s;s of Redre&s;s, I retired to my Dormitory, and pa&s;&s;ed the Night in bittere&s;t Reflections on my melancholly Situation.</P>
<P>My poor Child, who was then but eight Years of Age, and who&s;e &s;ole Support was on her HAPLESS, FRIENDLESS MOTHER, knew not what was become of me, or where to &s;eek me; and, with watchful Care, wore
<PB N="93" REF="93">
away the tedious Night, in painful Apprehen|&s;ions of what really had befallen me.</P>
<P>About Seven next Morning, I di&s;patched a Me&s;&s;enger to my poor little &s;uffering Infant; who &s;oon came to me, with her Eyes over|flowed with Tears, and a Heart full of un|di&s;&s;embled Angui&s;h. She immediately threw her Head upon my Bo&s;om, and remained in &s;peechle&s;s Grief, with which I equally en|countered her. For &s;ome Time the Child was &s;o entirely &s;en&s;ible of our Misfortunes, and of the Want of Means of being extricated from them, 'twas with Difficulty I &s;oothed her into a Calm. Alas! what has the POOR and FRIENDLESS TO HOPE FOR! &s;ur|rounded with Sorrows of &s;uch a Nature, that even People in tolerable Circum&s;tances find &s;ome Perplexity, when SO ASSAILED, to OVERCOME?</P>
<P>I &s;at down and wrote eight and thirty Let|ters before I &s;tirred out of my Chair, &s;ome of which went where I thought NATURE might have put in HER CLAIM, but I could ob|tain no An&s;wer; and, where I LEAST EX|PECTED, I FOUND REDRESS!</P>
<P>My poor little Wench was the melancholly Me&s;&s;enger, and neither eat or drank 'till &s;he
<PB N="94" REF="94">
had faithfully di&s;charged the Tru&s;t I repo&s;ed in her. To be &s;hort, the very Ladies who had vi&s;ited me the Night before, brought with them the late Mrs. <HI>Elizabeth Hughes;</HI> who, by Dint of her laying down a Couple of Guineas, and a Collection from the re&s;t, with a Guinea from Mrs. <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI> in the <HI>Piazza,</HI> I was &s;et at Liberty; and the Offi|cer advi&s;ed me to change Hats with him, that being the very Mark by which I was un|fortunately di&s;tingui&s;hed, and made known to him.</P>
<P>My Hat was ornamented with a beautiful Silver Lace, little the wor&s;e for wear, and of the Size which is now the pre&s;ent Ta&s;te; the Officer's a large one, cocked up in the Coach|man's Stile, and weightened with a horrible Quantity of Crape, to &s;ecure him from the Winter's Cold.</P>
<P>As to my Figure, 'tis &s;o well known it needs no De&s;cription; but my Friend, the Bailiff, was a very &s;hort, thick, red-faced Man: Of &s;uch a Corpulency, he might have appeared in the Character of <HI>Fal&s;taff,</HI> with|out the artful A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Stuffing, and his Head proportionable to his Body, con&s;equently we each of us made very droll Figures; he with his little laced Hat, which appeared on
<PB N="95" REF="95">
his Head of the Size of tho&s;e made for the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ladies, and my unfortunate Face &s;mothered under his, that I was almo&s;t as much incommoded as when I marched in the Ditch, under the in&s;upportable Weight of my Father's.</P>
<P>However, this &s;moaky Conveniency (for it &s;tunk in&s;ufferably of Tobacco) was a Security and ab&s;olute Prevention from other threatning Dangers, and I prudently retired into a mo&s;t di&s;mal and &s;olitary Man&s;ion in <HI>Great Queen's-Street,</HI> where I was hourly apprehen&s;ive of having the Hou&s;e fall upon my Head; though if it had, according to the old Proverb, it would not have been the fir&s;t Misfortune of the Kind that had befallen me. 'Twas the old Building, which has &s;ince been formed into &s;everal new and hand&s;ome Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>When my kind Redeemers took me away, they treated me with an elegant Supper, and &s;ent me Home to my Child with a Guinea in my Pocket; which they very politely de&s;ired me to accept on, as a Pre&s;ent to her.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed the Night in grateful Thoughts, both to Heaven, and tho&s;e appointed by that Great Power to &s;ave me from the Gulph of ab&s;olute De&s;truction. I never having been in
<PB N="96" REF="96">
a Di&s;tre&s;s of that kind before, laid my Sor|row deeper to Heart; and the inexpre&s;&s;ible Delight of being re&s;tored to my Child and Liberty, was almo&s;t too much for my fluttered Spirits at that Time to bear. So unexpected a Relief may be deemed a Prodigy! But what is there &s;o difficult or unlikely, in the Imagination of thoughtle&s;s Mortals, that the ALL-GRACIOUS RULER OF THE WORLD CANNOT BRING TO BEAR?</P>
<P>This very Circum&s;tance convinces me that no Misfortune, of ever &s;o dreadful a Nature, &s;hould excite us to de&s;pair. What had I to conceive, but the mi&s;erable Enforcement to linger out a wretched Life in Pri&s;on? A Child, who might po&s;&s;ibly have been de&s;pi&s;ed only for being mine; and, perhaps, reduced to Beggary.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the entertaining Ideas I had the Night of my Confinement; but, when I found Providence had been &s;o tenderly and indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly employed in my Behalf, I began to ar|raign my&s;elf for &s;uppo&s;ing that my Relations, in &s;uch Extremity, though they were RE|GARDLESS OF ME, would have abandoned AN INNOCENT AND HAPLESS CHILD to that rigourous Fate my Fears &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="97">
During my &s;olitary Re&s;idence in <HI>Queen's-Street,</HI> I never made my Appearance, for a con&s;iderable Time, but on a <HI>Sunday;</HI> and was obliged to have recour&s;e to as many Friends as I could mu&s;ter up, to help me to a Support for my&s;elf and my little Fellow-Sufferer. She, poor Child! was &s;o deeply affected with the Malevolence of my Fortune, it threw her into a very dangerous Illne&s;s; but, even in that Di&s;tre&s;s, Heaven rai&s;ed a Friend. My Brother <HI>Theophilus Cibber,</HI> kind|ly &s;ent an Apothecary, at his own Expence; for which I &s;hall ever acknowledge my&s;elf ex|treamly his Debtor, and am &s;orry I have not the Power of making a more &s;uitable Re|turn.</P>
<P>I left the poor Girl one <HI>Sunday,</HI> to prog for her and my&s;elf, by pledging with an Ac|quaintance a beautiful Pair of Sleeve-Buttons, which I effected in about two Hours; and, on my Return, asking the Landlady how the Child did, having left her very much indi&s;|po&s;ed: She told me, Mi&s;s went up, about an Hour and Half ago, to put on &s;ome clean Linnen; but, by her &s;taying, &s;he concluded &s;he was lain down, having complained of be|ing very &s;leepy before &s;he went up. But, Oh! Heaven! how va&s;t was my Grief and
<PB N="98" REF="98">
Surprize when I entered the Room, and found the poor little Soul &s;tretched on the Floor, in &s;trong Convul&s;ion Fits; in which &s;he had lain a con&s;iderable Time, and no Mortal near to give her the lea&s;t A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>I took her up, and, overcome with &s;trong Grief, immediately dropped her on the Floor; which I wonder did not ab&s;olutely end her by the Force of the Fall, as &s;he was in Fact a dead Weight. My &s;creaming and her falling rai&s;ed the Hou&s;e; and, in the Hurry of my Di&s;traction, I run into the Street, with my Shirt-Sleeves dangling loo&s;e about my Hands, my Wig &s;tanding on End,</P>
<Q>"Like Quills upon the fretful Porcupine,"</Q>
<P>And proclaiming the &s;udden Death of my much-beloved Child, a Crowd &s;oon gathered round me, and, in the Violence of my Di&s;|traction, in&s;tead of admini&s;tring any nece&s;&s;ary Help, wildly &s;tood among the Mob to recount the dreadful Di&s;a&s;ter.</P>
<P>The Peoples Compa&s;&s;ion was moved, 'tis true; but, as I happened not to be known to them, it drew them into A&s;toni&s;hment, to &s;ee the Figure of a young Gentleman, &s;o extrava|gantly grieved for the Lo&s;s of a Child. As I
<PB N="99" REF="99">
appeared very young, they looked on it as an unprecedented Affection in a Youth, and be|gan to deem me a Lunatick, rather then that there was any Reality in what I &s;aid.</P>
<P>One of the People who had been employed in the Care, as I then thought, of my ex|piring Infant, mi&s;&s;ing me, &s;ought me out and brought me Home, where I found the Child &s;till in violent Convul&s;ions; which held her from <HI>Sunday</HI> Eleven o'Clock in the Forenoon, without Intermi&s;&s;ion, 'till between the Hours of Eight and Nine next Morning.</P>
<P>In the Mid&s;t of this Scene of Sorrow, Mr. <HI>Adam Hallam,</HI> who lived next Door to my Lodging, hearing of my Misfortune, in a very genteel and tender Manner, proved him|&s;elf a REAL FRIEND, UNASKED. The fir&s;t In&s;tance I had of his Humanity, was a Letter of Condolence, in which was enclo&s;ed that nece&s;&s;ary and never-failing Remedy for every Evil, incidental to Mankind in general: And what was more extraordinary, was his con|&s;tantly &s;ending to enquire after the Child's Health, with the &s;ame re&s;pectful Regard as might have been expected had I been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that Affluence I but &s;ome few Months be|fore enjoyed.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="100">
At his own Reque&s;t, his Table was my own; and, I am certain, his good Nature laid an Embargo on his Per&s;on, as he often dined at Home in Compliment to me, rather than leave me to undergo the Shock of mingling with his Servants, or be di&s;tingui&s;hed by them as his Pen&s;ioner, by leaving me to eat by my&s;elf.</P>
<P>It happened, very <HI>&agrave; propos</HI> for me, that Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> had a Back-Door into his Hou&s;e, which prevented the Hazards I might other|wi&s;e have been liable to, by going into the Street: And indeed, as <HI>Sharp</HI> &s;ays to <HI>Gayle&s;s,</HI> THE BACK-DOOR I ALWAYS THOUGHT THE SAFEST, by which Means I had a fre|quent Opportunity of conver&s;ing with a &s;in|cere Friend; who&s;e Humanity a&s;&s;waged the Angui&s;h of my Mind, and who&s;e Bounty was compa&s;&s;ionately employed, for a con&s;iderable Time, to protect me and mine from the in|&s;upportable and di&s;tracting Fears of Want.</P>
<P>After what I have &s;aid, in regard to the Favours I received, I am certain no Per&s;on who ever knew what it was to be obliged, and had Hone&s;ty enough to DARE TO BE GRATEFUL, will condemn me for making this publick Acknowledgement, who have no
<PB N="101" REF="101">
other Means of doing Ju&s;tice to one, that had no Motive or Right to give &s;uch an In&s;tance of Benevolence, but excited alone from a natural Propen&s;ity to do a good Action.</P>
<P>Favours, when received, are too often for|got; and I have ob&s;erved Gratitude to be a Principle, that bears the &s;malle&s;t Share in the Hearts of tho&s;e where it ought to be mo&s;t &s;trongly Pre&s;ident, &s;o that I begin to imagine one Half of the World don't under&s;tand the real Etymology of the Word.</P>
<P>But that I may give farther A&s;&s;urances of my Dete&s;tation of that SIN OF UNKINDNESS AND INSOLENCE, I &s;hall proceed to give a farther Account of Obligations I received from Strangers, and &s;hall begin with tho&s;e conferred on me by the late Mr. <HI>Delane,</HI> Co|median; who, though almo&s;t a STRANGER TO MY PERSON, grew INTIMATE WITH MY AFFLICTION, and te&s;tified his Concern, by rai&s;ing a timely Contribution to alleviate my Di&s;tre&s;s; and redoubled the favourable Remedy, in the Politene&s;s of the Applica|tion.</P>

of the generous Natives of <HI>Ireland;</HI> who are, in Nature, a Set of worthy People, when they meet with Objects of Pity: And I have made bold to expatiate, in a particular Manner, on that Subject in my Hi&s;tory of Mr. <HI>Dumont,</HI> which will be immediately publi&s;hed, after the Conclu&s;ion of this Narrative.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now mention the friendly A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. <HI>Rich,</HI> Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI> Mr. <HI>Lacey</HI> (the &s;everal Governors of the two Theatres) Mr. <HI>Beard,</HI> and many more of the Gentlemen of the Stage, to who&s;e Bounty I &s;hall ever think my&s;elf indebted.</P>
<P>I am now going to take Notice of a Per&s;on who, at FRIENDLY DISTANCE, has many Times afforded a happy Relief to my bittere&s;t Wants; namely, the pre&s;ent Mrs. <HI>Cibber,</HI> who&s;e Pity was once the Means of &s;aving my Life, by preventing my going to a Jail: And more than once or twice fed both my&s;elf and Child, by timely Pre&s;ents, only from HEAR|ING of the &s;ad Circum&s;tances we laboured un|der. Whatever the World may think, in regard to my taking this publick Notice of her Humanity, I mu&s;t beg to be excu&s;ed, if I in&s;i&s;t on my being JUSTIFIABLE BY THE LAWS OF GRATITUDE; and, as I was GLAD TO BE OBLIGED, &s;hould think it the
<PB N="103" REF="103">
Height of In&s;olence, to be ASHAMED TO MAKE THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as my poor Girl began a little to recover, I &s;ometimes u&s;ed, by OWL-LIGHT, to creep out, in Search of Adventures; and, as there was frequently Plays acted at the <HI>Tennis-Court,</HI> with trembling Limbs and ach|ing Heart, adventured to &s;ee (as I was uni|ver&s;ally &s;tudied) whether there was any Cha|racter wanting; a Cu&s;tom very frequent among the Gentry who exhibited at that celebrated Slaughter-Hou&s;e of Dramatick Poetry.</P>
<P>One Night, I remember, <HI>The Recruiting Officer</HI> was to be PERFORMED, as they were plea&s;ed to call it, for the Benefit of a young Creature who had never played before. To my unbounded Joy, Captain <HI>Plume</HI> was &s;o very unfortunate, that he came at Five o'Clock to inform the young Gentlewoman he did not know a Line of his Part. I (who, though &s;hut up in the <HI>Mock Green-Room)</HI> did not dare to tell them I could do it, for fear of being heard to &s;peak, and that the Sound of my Voice, which is particular, and as well known as my Face, &s;hould betray me to tho&s;e A&s;&s;ailants of Liberty, who con&s;tantly attended every Play-Night there, to the inex|pre&s;&s;ible Terror of many a Potentate, who has
<PB N="104" REF="104">
quiveringly tremored out the Hero, le&s;t the &s;ad Cata&s;trophe &s;hould rather end in a Spung-Hou&s;e, than a Bowl of Poi&s;on or a timely Dagger&mdash;The want of which latter In&s;tru|ment of Death, I once &s;aw &s;upplied with a Lady's Busk; who had ju&s;t Pre&s;ence of Mind &s;ufficient to draw it from her Stays, and end at once her wretched Life, <HI>and more wretched Acting.</HI></P>
<P>Some of the&s;e Kind of meritorious Exhibi|ters were to Ma&s;&s;acre poor <HI>Farquhar</HI> that Night, but not one among them capable of playing, or rather going on for <HI>Plume;</HI> which they would have done perhaps, like a Chair &s;et up to fill up the Number in a Country-Dance. At la&s;t the Que&s;tion was put to me. I immediately replied (&s;eeing the Coa&s;t clear) I could do &s;uch a Thing; but, like <HI>Mo&s;ca,</HI> was re&s;olved to &s;tand on Terms, and make a Merit of Nece&s;&s;ity. <HI>To be &s;ure, Ma'am,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>I'd do any any Thing to eblige you: But I'm quite unprepared&mdash;I have nothing here proper&mdash;I want a Pair of White Stockings, and clean Shirt&mdash;</HI>Though, between Friends, in Ca&s;e of a lucky Hit. I had all tho&s;e Things ready in my Coat-Pocket; as I was certain, let what Part would befal me, Cleanline&s;s was a nece&s;&s;ary Ingre|dient.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="105">
Then I urged, That 'twould be &s;carce worth her while to pay me my Price: Upon which &s;he was immediately jogged by the El|bow, and took a&s;ide to advi&s;e her to offer me a Crown. I, being pretty well u&s;ed to the little Arts of tho&s;e worthy Wights, received the Propo&s;al &s;oon after; and, without making any An&s;wer to it, jogged the Lady<HI>'s other Elbow, and withdrew;</HI> a&s;&s;uring her, that under a Guinea I po&s;itively would not under|take it: That, to prevent any Demur with the re&s;t of the People, &s;he &s;hould give me the Sixteen Shillings privately, and publickly pay me Five.</P>
<P>Her Hou&s;e was as full as it could hold, and the Audience clattering for a Beginning: At length &s;he was obliged to comply with my Demands, and I got ready with utmo&s;t Expedition. When the Play (which was, in Fact, A FARCE TO ME) was ended, I thought it mighty proper to &s;tay 'till the Coa&s;t was clear, that I might carry off my&s;elf and Guinea &s;ecurely: But, in order to effect it, I changed Cloaths with a Per&s;on of low Degree, who&s;e happy Rags, and the kind Covert of Night, &s;ecured me from the Dangers I might have otherwi&s;e encountered. My Friend took one Road I another, but met at my Lodg|ings,
<PB N="106" REF="106">
where I rewarded him, poor as I was, with a Shilling; which, at that Time, I thought a competent Fortune for a younger Child.</P>
<P>It happened, not long after, that I was ap|plied to by a &s;trange, unaccountable Mortal, call'd <HI>Jockey Adams;</HI> famous for dancing the <HI>Jockey Dance,</HI> to the Tune of, <HI>Hor&s;e to New-Market.</HI> As I was gaping for a Cru&s;t, I readily &s;nap'd at the fir&s;t that offered, and went with this Per&s;on to a Town within four Miles of <HI>London,</HI> where a very extraordinary Occurrence happened; and which, had I been really what I repre&s;ented, might have rid in my own Coach, in the Rear of &s;ix Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding my Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, the Want of Cloaths was not among&s;t the Number. I ap|peared as Mr. <HI>Brown,</HI> (A NAME MOST HATEFUL TO ME NOW, FOR REASONS THE TOWN SHALL HAVE SHORTLY LEAVE TO GUESS AT) in a very genteel Manner; and, not making the lea&s;t Di&s;covery of my Sex by my Behaviour, ever endeavour|ing to keep up to the well-bred Gentlemen, I became, as I may mo&s;t properly term it, the unhappy Object of Love in a young Lady, who&s;e Fortune was beyond all earthly Power to deprive her of, had it been po&s;&s;ible for me
<PB N="107" REF="107">
to have been, what &s;he de&s;igned me, nothing le&s;s than her Husband She was an Orphan Heire&s;s, and under Age; but &s;o near it, that, at the Expiration<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> of eight Months, her Guardian re&s;igned his Tru&s;t, and I might have been at once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Lady, and forty thou&s;and Pounds in the Bank of <HI>England:</HI> Be&s;ides Effects in the <HI>Indies,</HI> that were worth about twenty Thou&s;and more.</P>
<P>This was a mo&s;t horrible Di&s;appointment on both Sides; the Lady of the Husband, and I of the Money; which would have been thought an excellent Remedy for Ills, by tho&s;e le&s;s &s;urrounded with Mi&s;ery than I was. I, who was the Principal in this Tragedy, was the la&s;t acquainted with it: But it got Wind from the Servants, to &s;ome of the Players; who, as <HI>Hamlet</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Can't keep a Secret,</HI> and they immediately communicated it to me.</P>
<P>Contrary to their Expectation, I received the Information with infinite Concern; not more in regard to my&s;elf, than from the poor Lady's Misfortune, in placing her Affec|tion on an improper Object; and whom, by Letters I afterwards received, confirmed me, <Q>"She was too fond of her mi&s;taken Bargain."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="108">
The Means by which I came by her Let|ters, was through the Per&s;wa&s;ion of her Maid; who, like mo&s;t Per&s;ons of her Function, are too often ready to carry on Intrigues. 'Twas no difficult Matter to per&s;wade an amorous Heart to follow its own Inclination; and ac|cordingly a Letter came to invite me to drink Tea, at a Place a little di&s;tant from the Hou&s;e where &s;he lived.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on given for this Interview was, the De&s;ire &s;ome young Ladies of her Acquaint|ance had to hear me &s;ing; and, as they never went to Plays in the Country, 'twould be a great Obligation to her if I would oblige her Friends, by complying with her Reque&s;t.</P>
<P>The Maid who brought this Epi&s;tle, in|form'd of the real Occa&s;ion of its being wrote; and told me, if I plea&s;ed, I might be happie&s;t Man in the Kingdom, before I was eight and forty Hours older. This frank Declaration from the Servant, gave me but an odd Opinion of the Mi&s;tre&s;s; and I &s;ometimes conceived, being con&s;cious how unfit I was to embrace &s;o favourable an Opportunity, that it was all a Joke.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="109">
However, be it as it might, I re&s;olved to go and know the Reality. The Maid too in|&s;i&s;ted that I &s;hould, and prote&s;ted her Lady had &s;uffered much on my Account, from the fir&s;t Hour &s;he &s;aw me; and, but for her, the Secret had never been di&s;clo&s;ed. She farther added, I was the fir&s;t Per&s;on who had ever made that Impre&s;&s;ion on her Mind. I own I felt a tender Concern, and re&s;olved within my|&s;elf to wait on her; and, by hone&s;tly con|fe&s;&s;ing who I was, kill or cure her Hopes of me for ever.</P>
<P>In Obedience to the Lady's Command I waited on her, and found her with two more much of her own Age, who were her Confi|dents, and entru&s;ted to contrive a Method to bring this Bu&s;ine&s;s to an End, by a private Marriage. When I went into the Room I made a general Bow to all, and was for &s;eating my&s;elf neare&s;t the Door; but was &s;oon lugg'd out of my Chair by a young Mad-cap of Fa&s;hion; and, to both the Lady's Confu&s;ion and mine, aukwardly &s;eated by her.</P>
<P>We were exactly in the Condition of Lord <HI>Hardy</HI> and Lady <HI>Charlotte,</HI> in <HI>The Funeral;</HI> and I &s;at with as much Fear in my Countenance, as if I had &s;tole her Watch from her Side.
<PB N="110" REF="110">
She, on her Part, often attempted to &s;peak; but had &s;uch a Tremor on her Voice, &s;he ended only in broken Sentences. 'Tis true, I have undergone the dreadful Apprehen&s;ions of a Bomb-Bailiff; but I &s;hould have thought one at that Time a &s;ea&s;onable Relief, and without repining have gone with him.</P>
<P>The before-mention'd Mad-cap, after putting us more out of Countenance by bur&s;ting into a violent Fit of Laughing, took the other by the Sleeve and withdrew, as &s;he thought, to give me a favourable Opportunity of paying my Addre&s;&s;es; but &s;he was deceived, for, when we were alone, I was ten thou&s;and Times in wor&s;e Plight than before: And what added to my Confu&s;ion was, &s;eeing the poor Soul di&s;&s;olve into Tears, which &s;he en|deavoured to conceal.</P>
<P>This gave me Freedom of Speech, by a gentle Enquiry into the Cau&s;e; and, by tenderly trying to &s;ooth her into a Calm, I un|happily encrea&s;ed, rather than a&s;&s;waged the dreadful Conflict of Love and Shame which labour'd in her Bo&s;om.</P>
<P>With much Difficulty, I mu&s;tered up Courage &s;ufficient to open a Di&s;cour&s;e, by which I began to make a Di&s;covery of my
<PB N="111" REF="111">
Name and Family, which &s;truck the poor Creature into A&s;toni&s;hment; but how much greater was her Surprize, when I po&s;itively a&s;&s;ured her that I was actually the younge&s;t Daughter of Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> and not the Per&s;on &s;he conceived me! She was ab&s;olutely &s;truck &s;peechle&s;s for &s;ome little Time; but, when &s;he regained the Power of Utterance, entreated me not to urge a Fal&s;hood of that Nature, which &s;he looked upon only as an Eva&s;ion, occa&s;ioned, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, through a Di&s;like of her Per&s;on: Adding, that her Maid had plainly told her I was no Stranger to her mi&s;erable Fate, as &s;he was plea&s;ed to term it; and, indeed, as I really thought it.</P>
<P>I &s;till in&s;i&s;ted on the Truth of my A&s;|&s;ertion; and de&s;ired her to con&s;ider, whether 'twas likely an indigent young Fellow mu&s;t not have thought it an unbounded Happine&s;s, to po&s;&s;e&s;s at once &s;o agreeable a Lady and im|men&s;e a Fortune, both which many a Noble|man in this Kingdom would have thought it worth while to take Pains to atchieve.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all my Arguments, &s;he was hard to be brought into a Belief of what I told her; and conceived that I had taken a Di&s;like to her, from her too readily con&s;enting to her Servant's making that Declaration of
<PB N="112" REF="112">
her Pa&s;&s;ion for me; and, for that Rea&s;on, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed I had but a light Opinion of her. I a&s;&s;ured her of the contrary, and that I was &s;orry for us both, that Providence had not ordained me to be the happy Per&s;on &s;he de&s;igned me; that I was much obliged for the Honour &s;he conferr'd on me, and &s;incerely grieved it was not in my Power to make a &s;uitable Return.</P>
<P>With many Sighs and Tears on her Side, we took a melancholly Leave; and, in a few Days, the Lady retir'd into the Country, where I have never heard from, or of her &s;ince; but hope &s;he is made happy in &s;ome worthy Husband, that might de&s;erve her.</P>
<P>She was not the mo&s;t Beautiful I have be|held, but quite the Agreeable; &s;ung finely, and play'd the Harp&s;ichord as well; under|&s;tood Languages, and was a Woman of real good Sen&s;e: But &s;he was, poor Thing! an In&s;tance, in regard to me, <HI>that the Wi&s;e&s;t may &s;ometimes err.</HI></P>
<P>On my Return Home, the Itinerant-Troop all a&s;&s;embled round me, to hear what had pa&s;&s;ed between the Lady and me&mdash;when we were to celebrate the Nuptials?&mdash;Be|&s;ides many other impertinent, &s;tupid Que&s;tions;
<PB N="113" REF="113">
&s;ome offering, agreeable to their villainous Di&s;po&s;itions, as the Marriage they &s;uppos'd would be a Secret, to &s;upply my Place in the Dark, to conceal the Fraud: Upon which I look'd at them very &s;ternly, and, with the Contempt they de&s;erved, demanded to know what Action of my Life had been &s;o very mon&s;trous, to excite them to think me capable of one &s;o cruel and infamous?</P>
<P>For the Lady's &s;ake, who&s;e Name I would not for the Univer&s;e have had banded about by the Mouths of low Scurrility, I not only told them I had revealed to her who I was, but made it no longer a Secret in the Town; that, in Ca&s;e it was &s;poke of, it might be regarded as an Impo&s;&s;ibility, or, at wor&s;t, a trump'd-up Tale by &s;ome ridiculous Block|head, who was fond of hearing him&s;elf prate, as there are indeed too many &s;uch: Of which, in Regard to my own Character, I have been often a melancholly Proof; and, as it ju&s;t now occurs to my Memory, will inform the Reader.</P>
<P>As Misfortunes are ever the mortifying Parents of each other, &s;o mine were teeming, and each new Day produced fre&s;h Sorrow: But as if the very Fiends of De&s;truction were employed to perpetrate mine, and that my
<PB N="114" REF="114">
real Mi&s;eries were not &s;ufficient to cru&s;h me with their Weight, a poor, beggarly Fellow, who had been &s;ometimes Supernumerary in <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> Theatre, and Part-writer, forged a mo&s;t villainous Lye; by &s;aying, I hired a very &s;ine Bay Gelding, and borrowed a Pair of Pi&s;tols, to encounter my Father upon <HI>Epping-Fore&s;t;</HI> where, I &s;olemnly prote&s;t, I don't know I ever &s;aw my Father in my Life: That I &s;topp'd the Chariot, pre&s;ented a Pi&s;tol to his Brea&s;t, and u&s;ed &s;uch Terms as I am a&s;hamed to in&s;ert; threaten'd to blow his Brains out that Moment, if he did not deliver&mdash;Upbraiding him for his Cruelty in abandoning me to tho&s;e Di&s;tre&s;&s;es he knew I underwent, when he had it &s;o amply in his Power to relieve me: That &s;ince he would not u&s;e that Power, I would force him to a Compliance, and was directly go|ing to di&s;charge upon him; but his Tears prevented me, and, asking my Pardon for his ill U&s;age of me, gave me his Pur&s;e with three&s;core Guineas, and a Promi&s;e to re&s;tore me to his Family and Love; on which I thank'd him, and rode off.</P>
<P>A likely Story, that my Father and his Servants were all &s;o intimidated, had it been true, as not to have been able to with&s;tand a &s;ingle &s;tout Highwayman, much more a Fe|male,
<PB N="115" REF="115">
and his own Daughter to! However, the Story &s;oon reached my Ear, which did not more enrage me on my own Account, than the impudent, ridiculous Picture the Scoundrel had drawn of my Father, in this &s;uppo&s;ed horrid Scene. The Recital threw me into &s;uch an agonizing Rage, I did not reco|ver it for a Month; but, the next Evening, I had the Satisfaction of being de&s;ignedly placed where this Villain was to be, and, concealed behind a Screen, heard the Lye re-told from his own Mouth.</P>
<P>He had no &s;ooner ended, than I ru&s;hed from my Covert, and, being armed with a thick oaken Plant, knocked him down, with|out &s;peaking a Word to him; and, had I not been happily prevented &s;hould, without the lea&s;t Remor&s;e, have killed him on the Spot. I had not Breath enough to enquire into the Cau&s;e of his barbarous Fal&s;hood, but others, who were le&s;s concerned than my&s;elf, did it for me; and the only Rea&s;on he a&s;&s;igned for his &s;aying it, was, <HI>He meant it as a Joke,</HI> which con&s;iderably added to the Vehemence of my Rage: But I had the Joy of &s;eeing him well caned, and obliged to ask my Pardon on his Knees&mdash;Poor Satisfaction for &s;o manife&s;t an Injury!</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="116">
This is, indeed, the greate&s;t and mo&s;t no|torious Piece of Cruelty that was ever forged again&s;t me; but 'tis a Privilege Numbers have taken with me, and I have generally found, in &s;ome Degree or other, my Cau&s;e revenged, though by my&s;elf un&s;ought: And 'tis more than morally po&s;&s;ible, I may live to &s;ee the Tears of Penitence flow from the Eyes of a yet remaining Enemy, to who&s;e Barbarity I am not the only Victim in the Family.

When I &s;ent, as is &s;pecified in the Letter, for an An&s;wer, I engaged a young Lady, who&s;e tender Compa&s;&s;ion was ea&s;ily moved to be the obliging Me&s;&s;enger. She returned, with friendly Expedition, and delivered me my own Epi&s;tle, enclo&s;ed in a Blank, from my Father. By the Alteration of my Coun|tenance &s;he too &s;oon perceived the ill Succe&s;s of her Negotiation, and bore a Part in my Di&s;tre&s;s.</P>

<P>The Prodigal, according to Holy Writ, was joyfully received by the offended Father: Nay, MERCY has even extended it&s;elf at the Place of Execution, to notorious Malefactors; but as I have not been guilty of tho&s;e Enormities incidental to the foremention'd Characters, permit me, gentle Reader, to demand what I

<P>THE SHOCK OF RECEIVING MY OWN LETTER did not excite a &s;udden Gu&s;t of unwarrantable Pa&s;&s;ion, but prey'd upon my Heart with the &s;low and eating Fire of Di&s;traction and De&s;pair, 'till it ended in a Fever, which now remains upon my Spirits; and which, I fear, I &s;hall find a difficult Task to overcome.</P>

How happy would that la&s;t Sentence have made me! as the Want of it has ab&s;olutely given me more inexpre&s;&s;ible Angui&s;h, than all the accumulated Sorrows I had known before; being now arrived to an Age of Thinking, and well weighing the Con&s;equences ari&s;ing from the various Occurences of Life: But this, I fear, will prove the heavie&s;t and bittere&s;t Corro&s;ive to my Mind; and the more I reflect on it, find my&s;elf le&s;s able to &s;upport &s;uch an Unkindne&s;s from that Hand, which, I thought, would have admini&s;ter'd the gentle Balm of Pity.</P>
<P>I am very certain my Father is to be, in Part, excu&s;ed, as he is too powerfully per|&s;waded by his cruel Monitor; who neither does, or ever will, pay the lea&s;t Regard to any Part of the Family, but her&s;elf: And though within a Year of Three&s;core pur&s;ues her own Intere&s;t, to the Detriment of others, with the &s;ame artful Vigilance that might be expected from a young Sharper of Twenty-four. I am certain I have found it &s;o, and am too &s;ure of its Effects from the Hour of my Birth; <HI>and my fir&s;t Fault, was being my Father's la&s;t Born.</HI> Even the little Follies of prattling Infancy were, by this Per&s;on, con|&s;trued in Crimes, before I had a more di&s;|tingui&s;hing

Sen&s;e than a Kitten. As I grew up, I too &s;oon perceived a rancourous Di&s;po&s;i|tion towards me, attended with Malice pre|pen&s;e, to de&s;troy that Power I had in the Hearts of both my Parents, where I was per|haps judged to &s;it too triumphant, and main|tained my Seat of Empire in my Mother's to her late&s;t Moments: And, 'tis po&s;&s;ible, had &s;he lived, my Enemy might not have carried this cruel Point, to prevent what I think I had a natural Right to receive, when I &s;o earne&s;tly implored it.</P>
<P>One Thing I mu&s;t in&s;ert for her Mortifica|tion, that my Con&s;cience is quite &s;erene; and, though &s;he won't &s;uffer my Father to be in Friend&s;hip with me, I am perfectly a&s;&s;ured that I have, in regard to any Offences to|wards him, made my Peace with the POWER SUPREME, which neither her Fal&s;hood or artful Malice could deprive me of. 'Tis now my Turn to forgive, as being the injured Per|&s;on; and, to &s;how her how much I chu&s;e to become her Superior in Mind, I not only par|don, but PITY HER: Though, I fear, &s;he rather pur&s;ues the Rules ob&s;erved in the fol|lowing Lines;</P>

<P>I remember the la&s;t Time I ever &s;poke with my Father, a Triumvirate was framed to that End, and I was &s;ent for from the Play|hou&s;e to put this ba&s;e De&s;ign in Execution. After being baited like a Bull at a Stake, and perceiving they were re&s;olved to carry their horrid Point again&s;t me, I grew enraged and ob&s;tinate; and, finding a growing Indignation &s;welling in my Bo&s;om, an&s;wered nothing to

their Purpo&s;e, which incen&s;ed my Father: Nor can I ab&s;olutely blame him, for 'twas undoubtedly my Duty to &s;atisfy any Demand he &s;hould think proper to make&mdash;But then again, I con&s;idered that his Judgement was &s;ufficient to correct the Errors of my Mind, without the in&s;olent A&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e, who&s;e wicked Hearts were fraught with my Ruin.</P>
<P>My Father, having been worked up to a &s;trong Fit of Impatience, ha&s;tily quitted his Hou&s;e, with a Declaration not to return to it, 'till I was gone. This, I am too well a&s;&s;ured,</P>

<P>I &s;taid a few Moments after him, when &s;he, who was once my elde&s;t Si&s;ter, was plea&s;ed to ask the re&s;t of her Colleagues, if they had done with me; who an&s;wering in the Affirma|tive, in a peremptory Manner turned me out of Doors.</P>
<P>I was then married, and had been &s;o near four Years, therefore did not conceive that any one had a Right to treat me like a Child, and could not ea&s;ily brook being forced into a Submi&s;&s;ion of that Nature. But the main De&s;ign was to deprive me of a Birth-right&mdash;and they have done it; for which, in Obedi|ence

No! &s;o far from it, I am rather delighted than di&s;|plea&s;ed, as it convinces me my Father has yet &s;ome Power over him&s;elf; and, though deaf to me, has li&s;tened to the tender Call of Mercy, by a &s;ea&s;onable Protection of their Youth and Innocence.</P>
<P>I apprehend I &s;hall be called in Que&s;tion for my Inability, in conveying Ideas of the Pa&s;&s;ions which mo&s;t tenderly affect the Heart, by &s;o often having Recour&s;e to abler Pens than my own, by my frequent Quotations; but, in An&s;wer to that, I mu&s;t beg to be ex|cu&s;ed, and al&s;o ju&s;tified, as mine and others Griefs were more &s;trongly painted, by tho&s;e Authors I have made bold with, than was in the Power of my weak Capacity. I thought there was greater Judgment in &s;uch References, than in vainly attempting to blunder out my Di&s;tre&s;s; and po&s;&s;ibly, by that Means, tire the Reader in the Peru&s;al.</P>

As I have fini&s;h'd my tragical Narration, I &s;hall return to the Town, where I was honour'd with the young Lady's Regard. Our Departure from thence happened &s;oon after, and Kings, Queens, Lords and Com|mons, were all to&s;s'd up in an undi&s;tingui&s;hed Bundle from that Place; and, like <HI>Sarron</HI>'s Itinerants, e&s;corted to another in a Cart.</P>
<P>As my unlucky Stars were ever employed in working on the Anvil of Misfortune, I, unknowingly, took a Lodging in a Bailiff's Hou&s;e, though not as <HI>Clodio</HI> did, who had three Writs again&s;t him; but I was not ab|&s;olutely certain how long it might be, ere &s;o terrible a Cata&s;trophe might be the Ca&s;e, being then but ten Miles from <HI>London,</HI> and every Hour of my Life liable to be &s;een by &s;ome Air-taking Trade&s;man, to whom, 'twas twenty to one, I might be indebted.</P>
<P>Under &s;uch a Circum&s;tance as this, to be &s;ure, I pa&s;s'd my Time mighty plea&s;ingly! but that I might be delivered of the Anxiety and con&s;tant Fears that attended me, I per&s;waded our Manager (who was under the &s;ame un|fortunate Circum&s;tance) there was, to my certain Knowledge, a Writ i&s;&s;ued out again&s;t him, with which he was &s;oon alarmed; and,
<PB N="128" REF="128">
in order to elude the Hunters, &s;uddenly took away his Company by Night.</P>
<P>I own this was a ba&s;e Trick, to deprive the Town of the infinite Plea&s;ure they mu&s;t have received from the incomparable Re|pre&s;entations of our &s;onorous Collection; who, if Noi&s;e could plead any Claim to Merit, they were undoubtedly the greate&s;t Proficients of the Age.

<P>However, away we went; and, to the great Surprize of the Inhabitants of the next Place we adventur'd to, about Six o'Clock on a <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning we made our Entry, and be&s;ieged the Town; but, as our Commander was one of a mo&s;t intrepid A&s;&s;urance, he &s;oon fram'd &s;ome political Excu&s;es for the Un&s;ea&s;onablene&s;s both of the Hour and Day. The Land&s;ord, who happened luckily for us to be an indolent, good-natur'd Man, &s;eeing &s;o large a Company, and &s;uch Boxes full of NOTHING, come into his Hou&s;e, ea&s;ily di&s;pen&s;ed with the Oddity of our Arrival, and called out lu&s;tily for his Maid and
<PB N="129" REF="129">
Daughter to &s;et on the great Pot for the Buttock of Beef, and to make a fine Fire to roa&s;t the Loin of Veal. He al&s;o ordered the O&s;tler to help up with the Boxes, which, I own, were weighty; but, I believe, the chief of the Burden con&s;i&s;ted of &s;cabbardle&s;s, ru&s;ty Swords, and departed Mop&s;ticks, tran&s;migrated into Tragedy Truncheons.</P>
<P>For the fir&s;t Week, we lived like tho&s;e imaginary Sons of Kings we frequently re|pre&s;ented; but, at length, we play'd a Night or two, and no Money coming, upon Enquiry what was for Dinner, the good Ho&s;t, with an altered Countenance, &s;ignified he thought 'twould be better for us to find our own Pro|vi&s;ion; and apprehending 'twould not do, he advi&s;ed us to make one good Hou&s;e to pay him, and march off: Upon which one, who&s;e Appetite was extreamly keen, di&s;covered a &s;udden Palene&s;s; another, enraged at the Di&s;|appointment, and feeling the &s;ame Demands from Nature, though not equally pa&s;&s;ive in his Di&s;po&s;ition, thundered out a Volley of Oaths, with the Addition of terrible Threats to leave the Hou&s;e; which the Landlord would have been well plea&s;ed had he put in Force, and, with a calm Contempt, &s;ignified as much.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="130">
As I had a Child to &s;upport, as well as my unfortunate Self, I thought it highly proper to become a friendly Mediator between the&s;e two Per&s;ons, and very judiciou&s;ly in|troduced my&s;elf into farther Credit, by en|deavouring to palliate the Matter: But the in&s;en&s;ible Puppy, paying more Regard to his offended Honour than his craving Appetite, &s;colded him&s;elf out of the Hou&s;e; and my Daughter and I were continued, by my prudently pre&s;erving THE GENTLEMAN, in&s;tead of launching into the barbarous Enormities of the BILLINGSGATE HERO.</P>
<P>Bu&s;ine&s;s continuing very &s;hocking, I really was a&s;hamed to pre&s;ume any longer on the partial Regard paid to me by the injur'd Man; and, at la&s;t, propo&s;ed his u&s;ing his Intere&s;t to put off as many Tickets as he po&s;&s;ibly could, in order to make up the &s;everal De|ficiencies of the Company. This Propo&s;ition was kindly accepted, and he &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed a &s;ufficient Number of Tickets to defray all Charges, with many Acknowledgements to me for the Hint; and, that I might not run the Hazard of lo&s;ing the Reputation I had gain'd, I &s;et off the Day after, well knowing that a
<PB N="131" REF="131">
&s;econd Misfortune of this Nature would not have &s;o happy an End.</P>
<P>With a &s;olitary Shilling I went to <HI>London,</HI> and took a Lodging in about two Hours after|wards at a private Hou&s;e, in <HI>Little Turn|&s;tile, Holborn;</HI> but being &s;oon enquired after by another Manager, &s;et out from <HI>London</HI> for <HI>Dartford,</HI> about Three o'Clock in the After|noon on Foot, in a dreadful Shower of Rain, and reached the Town by Eight in the Even|ing.</P>
<P>I play'd that Night, for 'tis lo&s;ing their Charter to begin before Nine or Ten; but my Pumps being thin, and the Rain extream heavy, I contracted &s;uch a Hoar&s;ene&s;s I was the Day following turn'd off with Half a Crown, and rendered incapable. An excellent Demon&s;tra|tion of the Humanity of tho&s;e low-lived Wretches! who have no farther Regard to the Per&s;ons they employ, but while they are immediately &s;erving 'em; and look upon Players like Pack-Hor&s;es, though they live by 'em.</P>
<P>When I got to <HI>London,</HI> I had, on Ac|count of my Hoar&s;ene&s;s, no View of getting my Bread, as 'twas impo&s;&s;ible to hear me &s;peak without a clo&s;e Application of an Ear
<PB N="132" REF="132">
to my Mouth. I was then reduced to the Nece&s;&s;ity of pledging, from Day to Day, either my own or Child's Cloaths for our Support; and we were &s;tripp'd to even but a bare Change to keep us decently clean, by the Time I began to recover my Voice.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I was capable of &s;peaking to be heard, I took a &s;econd Owl-light Opportunity to &s;eek for Bu&s;ine&s;s, and happily &s;ucceeded in my Endeavour; and as from Evil often un|expected Good ari&s;es, &s;o did it then to me. I went to play a Part in <HI>Gravel-Lane,</HI> where I met with a Woman, who told me &s;he had Scenes and Cloaths in LIMBO for two Guineas; and, if I could propo&s;e any Means for their Redemption, &s;he would make me Manager of her Company, if I thought fit to &s;et out with her. I a&s;&s;ured her, &s;o far from rai&s;ing two Guineas, I really did not know where to levy as many Pence; but, in the Night, contemplating on my haple&s;s Fate, I recollected a Friend that I be|lieved would, on Trial, oblige me with that Sum.</P>
<P>To &s;trengthen my Cau&s;e, I wrote a Letter as from a Spunging-Hou&s;e, and &s;ent one of the Performers, who had extreamly the Air of a Bomb-Bailiff, to repre&s;ent that Character.
<PB N="133" REF="133">
My Friend, moved at my &s;uppo&s;ed Di&s;tre&s;s, directly granted my Suit; the Goods were redeemed, and the next Morning we &s;et &s;ail, with a few Hands, for <HI>Grave&s;end.</HI></P>
<P>For about a Month we got, one Week with another, a Guinea each Per&s;on; from thence we proceeded to <HI>Harwich,</HI> where we met with equal Succe&s;s for three Weeks more: But unfortunately the Managere&s;s's Husband, who was no Member of the Company, was under Sentence of Tran&s;portation in <HI>Newgate,</HI> and &s;he being frequently obliged to pay her Devoirs to her departing Spou&s;e in the di&s;mal Ca&s;tle of Di&s;tre&s;s, we broke up, and I re|turned to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>My projecting Brain was forced again to &s;et it&s;elf to work, to find fre&s;h Means of Sub&s;i&s;tance; but, for &s;ome time, its Labours were ineffectual, 'till even the la&s;t Thread of Invention was worn out. At la&s;t I re|&s;olved to pay circular Vi&s;its to my good-natur'd Friends, who redeemed me from the Jaws of De&s;truction, when under Confinement in <HI>Jack&s;on's-Alley.</HI> I thought the be&s;t Ex|cu&s;e I could make for becoming &s;o importunate, was to fix it on a Point of Gratitude, in taking the earlie&s;t Opportunity my Circum&s;tances would admit of, to return my &s;incere&s;t Thanks
<PB N="134" REF="134">
for &s;o infinite an Obligation; and, after having &s;tarved all Day, by the friendly A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Night, I adventured, and was, by each Per&s;on in my &s;everal Vi&s;its, kindly received, and con&s;tantly &s;ent Home with a Means to &s;ub&s;i&s;t for &s;ometimes a Day or two; which, as my Circum&s;tances &s;tood, was no &s;mall Comfort to one who proceeded in paralytick Order, upon every Excur&s;ion.</P>
<P>Among the di&s;tre&s;sful Evening Patroles I made, I one Evening paid my Brother a Vi&s;it, who kindly compa&s;&s;ionated my Sor|row, and clapping Half a Crown in my Hand, earne&s;tly enjoyned me to dine next Day with him at a Friend's Hou&s;e; who, he knew, had a natural Tendency to Acts of Humanity, and conceived would, in a genteel Manner, be &s;erviceable to me. His good-natur'd De&s;ign had the de&s;ired Effect; and, in le&s;s than three Days I was, by my Brother's Friend, introduced to L&mdash;d <HI>A&mdash;a,</HI> who wanted a Gentleman, (being newly come from <HI>I&mdash;d)</HI> and nice in regard to the Per|&s;on he intended for that Office. One well-bred, and who could &s;peak <HI>French,</HI> were two ne|ce&s;&s;ary Articles; upon which, Mention was made of me, and an open Declaration who I really was, with a piteous Account of my Misfortunes; which his Lord&s;hip very tender|ly
<PB N="135" REF="135">
con&s;idered, and received me upon the Re|commendation of my Brother's Friend.</P>
<P>The Day following I entered into my new Office, which made me the &s;uperior Dome&s;tick in the Family. I had my own Table, with a Bottle of Wine, and any &s;ingle Di&s;h I cho&s;e for my&s;elf, <HI>extra</HI> of what came from my Lord's, and a Guinea paid me every <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> Morning, that being the Day of the Week on which I entered into his Lord|&s;hip's Service.</P>
<P>At this Time, my Lord kept in the Hou&s;e with him a <HI>Fille de Joye.</HI> Though no great Beauty, yet infinitely agreeable, (a Native of <HI>Ireland)</HI> remarkably genteel and finely &s;haped; and a &s;en&s;ible Woman, who&s;e Under&s;tanding was embelli&s;hed by a Fund of good Nature.</P>
<P>When there was any extraordinary Company, I had the Favour of the Lady's at my Table; but, when there was no Company at all, his Lord&s;hip permitted me to make a third Per&s;on at his, and very good-naturedly obliged me to throw off the Re&s;traint of Behaviour incidental to the Servant, and a&s;&s;ume that of the humble Friend and chearful Companion. Many agreeable Evenings I pa&s;&s;ed in this Manner; and, when Bed-time approached, I took Leave
<PB N="136" REF="136">
and went Home to my own Lodgings; at|tending the next Morning at Nine, my appointed Hour.</P>
<P>I marched every Day through the Streets with Ea&s;e and Security, having his Lord&s;hip's Protection, and proud to cock my Hat in the Face of the be&s;t of the Bailiffs, and &s;hake Hands with them into the Bargain. In this State of Tranquility I remained for about five Weeks; when, as the Devil would have it, there came two &s;upercilious Coxcombs, who, wanting Di&s;cour&s;e and Humanity, hear|ing that I was his Lord&s;hip's Gentleman, made me their unhappy Theme, and took the Liberty to arraign his Under&s;tanding for en|tertaining one of an improper Sex in a Po&s;t of that Sort. His Lord&s;hip's Argument was, for a con&s;iderable Time, &s;upported by the Strength of his Pity for an unfortunate Wretch, who had never given him the lea&s;t Offence: But the pragmatical Block|heads teized him at la&s;t into a Re&s;olution of di&s;charging me the next Day, and I was once again reduced to my Scenes of Sorrow and De&s;olation.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t do Ju&s;tice to the Peer, to confe&s;s he did not &s;end me away empty handed; but &s;o &s;mall a Pittance as he was plea&s;ed to be&s;tow,
<PB N="137" REF="137">
was little more than a momentary Support for my&s;elf and Child. When my &s;mall Stock was exhau&s;ted, I was mo&s;t terribly puzzled for a Recruit.</P>
<P>Friend&s;hip began to cool! Shame encom|pa&s;&s;ed me! that where I had the &s;malle&s;t Hope of Redre&s;s remaining, I had not Cou|rage &s;ufficient to make an Attack. In &s;hort, Life became a Burden to me, and I began to think it no Sin not only to WISH, but even DESIRE to die. When Poverty throws us beyond the Reach of Pity, I can compare our Beings to nothing &s;o adaptly, as the comfort|le&s;s Array of tattered Garments in a fro&s;ty Morning.</P>
<P>But Providence, who has ever been my Friend and kind Director, as I was in one of my Fits of De&s;pondency, &s;uddenly gave a Check to that Error of my Mind, and wrought in me a Re&s;olution of making a bold Pu&s;h; which had but two Chances, either for my Happine&s;s or De&s;truction&mdash;Which is as follows.</P>
<P>I took a neat Lodging in a Street facing <HI>Red-Lyon-Square,</HI> and wrote a Letter to Mr. <HI>Beard,</HI> intimating to him the &s;orrowful Plight I was in; and, in a Quarter of an

Hour after, my Reque&s;t was mo&s;t obligingly complied with by that worthy Gentleman, who&s;e Bounty enabled me to &s;et forward to <HI>Newgate-Market,</HI> and bought a con&s;iderable Quantity of Pork at the be&s;t Hand, which I converted into Sau&s;ages, and with my Daugh|ter &s;et out, laden with each a Burden as weighty as we could well bear; which, not having been u&s;ed to Luggages of that Nature, we found extreamly trouble&s;ome: But <HI>Nece&s;|&s;itas non habeat Leges&mdash;</HI>We were bound to that, or &s;tarve.</P>
<P>Thank Heaven, our Loads were like <HI>Ae&s;op</HI>'s when he cho&s;e to carry the Bread, which was the weightie&s;t Burden, to the A&s;toni&s;hment of his Fellow-Travellers; not con&s;idering that his Wi&s;dom preferred it, be|cau&s;e he was &s;ure it would lighten as it went: So did ours, for as I went only where I was known, I &s;oon di&s;po&s;ed, among my Friends, of my whole Cargo; and was happy in the Thought, that the utmo&s;t Exce&s;&s;es of my Misfortunes had no wor&s;e Effect on me, than an indu&s;trious and hone&s;t Inclination to get a &s;mall Livelihood, without Shame or Re|proach: Though the Arch-Dutche&s;s of our Family, who would not have relieved me with a Half-penny Roll or a Draught of Small-Beer, imputed this to me as a Crime.</P>

Too &s;ure I found it &s;o! for I could name many Per&s;ons, who are &s;till in Being, that I have both clothed and fed, who have &s;ince met with Succe&s;s; but when &s;trong Ne|ce&s;&s;ity reduced me to an Attempt of u&s;ing their Friend&s;hip, &s;carce afforded me a civil An&s;wer, which clo&s;ed in an ab&s;olute Denial, and con&s;equently the Sting of Di&s;appointment on &s;uch Occa&s;ions &s;truck the deeper to my Heart: Though none &s;o poignant, as the Re|buffs I met with from tho&s;e who ought, in regard to them&s;elves, to have prevented my being under &s;uch univer&s;al Obligations; but, in&s;tead of acting agreeable to the needful Sen|timents of Compa&s;&s;ion and &s;orrowful Regret, for the Sufferings of a near Relation, where a villainous Odium could not be thrown a ridi|culous one was &s;ure to be ca&s;t, even on the innocent Actions of my Life.</P>
<P>Upon being met with a Hare in my Hand, carried by Order to the Peer I had then lately lived with, this &s;ingle Creature was enume|rated
<PB N="141" REF="141">
into a long Pole of Rabbits; and 'twas affirmed as a Truth, that I made it my daily Practice to cry them about the Streets.</P>
<P>This Fal&s;hood was &s;ucceeded by another, that of my &s;elling Fi&s;h, an Article I never thought of dealing in; but notwith&s;tanding, the wicked Forger of this Story po&s;itively de|clared, that I was &s;elling &s;ome Flounders one Day, and, &s;eeing my Father, &s;tept mo&s;t au|daciou&s;ly up to him, and &s;lapt one of the large&s;t I had full in his Face. Who, that has common Sen&s;es, could be &s;o credulous to re|ceive the lea&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion from &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent a Tale; or that, if it had been true, if I had e&s;caped my Father's Rage, the Mob would not, with &s;tricte&s;t Ju&s;tice, have pre|vented my &s;urviving &s;uch an unparallel'd Villainy one Moment?</P>
<P>I always thought my&s;elf unaccountable enough in Reality, to excite the various Pa&s;&s;ions of Grief and Anger, Pity or Con|tempt, without unnece&s;&s;ary additional Fal&s;|hoods to aggravate my Mi&s;deeds. I own I was obliged, 'till &s;eiz'd with a Fever, to trudge from one Acquaintance to another with Pork and Poultry, but never had the Honour of being a Travelling-fi&s;hmonger, nor the
<PB N="142" REF="142">
Villainy of being guilty of that infamous Crime I was inhumanly charged with.</P>
<P>When I was brought &s;o low, by my Illne&s;s, as to be di&s;empowered to carry on my Bu&s;ine&s;s my&s;elf, I was forced to depend upon the in|fant Indu&s;try of my poor Child; who&s;e Strength was not able to bear an equal Share of Fatigue, &s;o that I con&s;equently was obliged to &s;uffer a con&s;iderable Deficiency, by the Neglect of my Cu&s;tomers: And though I could &s;carce afford my&s;elf the lea&s;t Indulgence, in regard to my Illne&s;s, I found, though in a trifling Degree, it largely incroached upon my &s;lender Finances, &s;o that I was reduced to my la&s;t three Pounds of Pork, nicely prepared for Sau&s;ages, and left it on the Table covered up. As I was upon Recovery, I took it in my Head a little fre&s;h Air would not be ami&s;s, and &s;et forth into <HI>Red-Lyon-Fields:</HI> But, on my Return, OH! DISASTROUS CHANCE! a hungry Cur had mo&s;t &s;avagely entered my Apartment, confounded my Cookery, and mo&s;t incon&s;iderately devoured my remaining Stock, and, from that Hour, a Bankruptcy en&s;ued! the Certificate of which was &s;igned, by the Woefulne&s;s of my Countenance at the horrid View.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="143">
The Child and I gap'd and &s;tar'd at each other; and, with a De&s;pondency in our Faces, very natural on &s;o deplorable an Occa&s;ion, we &s;at down and &s;ilently conceived that &s;tarving mu&s;t be the &s;ad Event of this &s;hocking Ac|cident, having at that Time neither Meat, Money, nor Friends. My Week's Lodging was up the next Day, and I was very &s;ure of a con&s;tant Vi&s;it from my careful Landlord, but how to an&s;wer him was a puzzling Debate <HI>between me and my&s;elf;</HI> and I was very well a&s;&s;ured, could only be an&s;wered but by an Affirmative in that Point.</P>
<P>After having &s;ighed away my Sen&s;es for my departed Pork, I began to con&s;ider that Sorrow would not retrieve my Lo&s;s, or pay my Landlord; and without really knowing where to go, or to whom I &s;hould apply, I walked out 'till I &s;hould either meet an Ac|quaintance, or be in&s;pired with &s;ome Thought that might happily draw off the Scene of Di&s;tre&s;s I was then immers'd in.</P>
<P>Luckily, I met with an old Gentlewoman whom I had not &s;een many Years, and who knew me when I was a Child. She, per|ceiving Sadne&s;s in my A&s;pect, enquired into the Cau&s;e of that, and my being in Mens

Cloaths; which, as far as I thought proper, I informed her. When we parted, &s;he &s;lipt Five Shillings into my Hand; on which I thankfully took Leave, went Home with a chearful Heart, paid my Lodging off next Morning, and quitted it.</P>
<P>The next Vexation that aro&s;e, was how to get another; for the Child was too young to be &s;ent on &s;uch an Errand, and I did not dare to make my Appearance too openly: How|ever, that Grief was &s;oon &s;olved by the good Nature of a young Woman, who gave a friendly Invitation to us both; and, though not in the highe&s;t Affluence, &s;upported my&s;elf and Child for &s;ome Time, without any View or Hopes of a Return, which has &s;ince e&s;tabli&s;h|ed a la&s;ting Friend&s;hip between us, as I re|ceived more Humanity from her Indigence, than I could obtain even a Glimp&s;e of from tho&s;e, who&s;e FORTUNES I had a more ample Right to expect a Relief from.</P>
<P>I had not been many Days with my Friend before I relap&s;ed, my Fever encrea&s;ing to that Degree my Death was hourly expected; and, being deprived of my Sen&s;es, was left with|out Means of Help in this unhappy Situation, and, had it not been for the exten&s;ive Good|ne&s;s of the Per&s;on before-mentioned, my

Child mu&s;t have either begged her Bread, or peri&s;hed for the Want of it.</P>
<P>When I was capable of giving a rational An&s;wer, &s;he was my fir&s;t Care; and I had, in the Mid&s;t of this Extremity, the plea&s;ing Relief of being informed, my Friend's Hu|manity had protected her from that Di&s;tre&s;s I apprehended &s;he mu&s;t have otherwi&s;e &s;uffer|ed, from the Severity of my Illne&s;s. I was incapable of writing, and therefore &s;ent a verbal Me&s;&s;age, by my good Friend, to my Lord <HI>A&mdash;a;</HI> who &s;ent me a Piece of Gold, and expre&s;&s;ed a tender Concern for my Misfor|tunes and violent Indi&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I was able to crawl, I went to pay my Duty there, and was again relieved through his Bounty; and might have returned to my Place, 'till &s;omething el&s;e had fallen out, but that his Lord&s;hip was obliged to go &s;uddenly out of <HI>England,</HI> which, as I had a Child, was not &s;uitable to either him or me.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Yeates</HI>'s New Wells being open, and he having Occa&s;ion for a Singer in the Se|rious Part of an Entertainment, called, <HI>Jupi|ter and Alomena,</HI> I was &s;ent for to be his <HI>Mercury;</HI> and, by the Time that was ready

Nor had I any Re|medy applied, except an Emetick, pre&s;cribed and &s;ent me by my Si&s;ter <HI>Marples,</HI> who was the only Relation I had that took any Notice of me.</P>
<P>As I have no Power of making her Amends, equal to my Inclinations, I can only entreat the Favour of my Acquaintance in ge|neral, and tho&s;e whom I have not the Plea|&s;ure of knowing, whenever 'tis convenient and agreeable for them to u&s;e a neat, well|accommodated Hou&s;e of Entertainment, they will fix a la&s;ting Obligation on me by going to her's, which &s;he opened la&s;t <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> the 20th In&s;tant, in <HI>Fullwood's-Rent,</HI> near <HI>Gray's-Inn:</HI> Where they will be certain of Fle&s;h, Fi&s;h and Poultry, dre&s;&s;ed in an elegant Manner, at rea&s;onable Rates; good Wines, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and a Politene&s;s of Behaviour agreeable to the Gentlewo|man; who&s;e hard Struggles, through Seas of unde&s;erved Misfortunes, will, I hope, be a Claim to that Regard I am certain &s;he de|&s;erves, and will, wherever &s;he finds it, mo&s;t gratefully acknowledge.</P>

For &s;ome few Months I was employed, as before-mentioned, 'till <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Fair; and, as I thought 'twould be more advan|tageous to me to be there, obtained Leave of Mr. <HI>Yeates</HI> to quit the Wells for the four Days, and returned to him at the Expiration thereof.</P>
<P>The Rumour of my being in Bu&s;ine&s;s having &s;pread it&s;elf among my Creditors, I was obliged to decamp; being too well a&s;|&s;ured my &s;mall Revenue, which was but ju&s;t &s;ufficient to buy Bread and Cheefe, would not protect me from a Jail, or &s;atisfy their De|mands. Had not my Nece&s;&s;ities been pre&s;&s;ing, my Service would not have been purcha&s;ed at &s;o cheap a Rate; but thought I mu&s;t have been everla&s;tingly condemned, had I, through Pride, been &s;o repugnant to the Laws of Na|ture, Rea&s;on and maternal Love, as to have rejected, with in&s;olent Scorn, this &s;canty Main|tainance, when I was con&s;cious I had not Six-pence in the World to purcha&s;e a Loaf. I therefore found it highly nece&s;&s;ary to &s;et apart the Remembrance of what I had been,
<Q REND="margQuotes">"I THEN WAS WHAT I HAD MADE MY|SELF;"</Q>
<PB N="148" REF="148">
And, con&s;equently, obliged to &s;ubmit to every Inconvenience of Life my Misfortunes could po&s;&s;ibly involve me in.</P>
<P>The Amount of all I owed in the World did not ari&s;e to Five and Twenty Pounds, but I was as much perplexed for that Sum as if it had been as many Thou&s;ands. In order to &s;e|cure my Per&s;on and defend my&s;elf from Want, I joined with a Man who was a Ma&s;ter of Legerdemain; but, on my entering on an Agreement with him, he commenced Mana|ger, and we tragedized in a Place called <HI>Pet|ticoat-Lane,</HI> near <HI>White-Chapel;</HI> I then taking on me THAT DARLING NAME OF BROWN, which was a very great Help to my Conceal|ment, and indeed the only ADVANTAGE I EVER RECEIVED FROM IT, OR THOSE WHO HAVE A BETTER CLAIM TO IT.</P>
<P>But to my Purpo&s;e. I &s;oon grew tired of leading &s;uch a Life of Fear, and re&s;olved to make Trial of the Friend&s;hip of my late Un|cle, and wrote a melancholly Epi&s;tle to him; earne&s;tly imploring his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, for the &s;ake of his decea&s;ed Si&s;ter (my dear Mother) to give me as much Money as would be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;et me up in a Publick Hou&s;e. I told him, I would not put it upon the Foot of borrowing, as 'twas ten Millions to one whe|ther
<PB N="149" REF="149">
he might ever be repaid; and, in Ca&s;e of Failure of a Promi&s;e of that Nature, I knew I mu&s;t of Cour&s;e be &s;ubject to his Di&s;|plea&s;ure, therefore fairly de&s;ired him to make it a Gift, if he thought my Circum&s;tances worthy his Con&s;ideration; which, to do him Ju&s;tice, indeed he did, and ordered me to take a Hou&s;e directly, that he might be a&s;|&s;ured of the Sincerity of my Intention.</P>
<P>I obeyed his Commands the next Day, and, as I have been in a Hurry from the Hour of my Birth, precipitately took the fir&s;t Hou&s;e where I &s;aw a Bill, and which, unfortunately for me, was in <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> that had been mo&s;t irregularly and indecently kept by the la&s;t Incumbent, who was a celebrated Dealer in murdered Reputations, Whole&s;ale and Re|tale.</P>
<P>This I, through a natural Inadvertency, never con&s;idered, nor what ill Con&s;equences mu&s;t rea&s;onably attend &s;o imprudent a Choice of my Situation. Choice I can't properly call it, for I really did not give my&s;elf Time to make one, 'twas &s;ufficient that I had a Hou&s;e; and rattled away, as fa&s;t as a Pair of Hor&s;es could gallop, to inform my Uncle <HI>how charmingly I was fixed.</HI></P>

He, according to his Word, gave me a Bank-Note directly, and a Sum of Money in Gold be&s;ides. Providence was merciful enough to afford me a decent Quantity of Patience to &s;tay long enough to thank him, in that re|&s;pectful Manner which Duty obliged me to, and his Bounty truly de&s;erved; but, I remem|ber, as &s;oon as I got into the Coach, I began to think the Happine&s;s I then enjoyed to be too great, and too &s;ub&s;tantial to be true.</P>
<P>Having been &s;o long the Slave of Mi&s;ery! and Child of Sorrow! it appeared to me like a Dream; and I was in <HI>Nell Job&s;on</HI>'s Condi|tion on that Score, who never wi&s;hed, from a Surmi&s;e of exactly the &s;ame Kind, ever to wake again. I had not Patience to go Home, but &s;topped at a Tavern to count my Money; and read my Note as often, I believe, as there were Shillings in every &s;eparate Pound, 'till o' my Con&s;cience I had enumerated every Shilling, in Imagination, to a Pound.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing I did, was to ha&s;ten to my principal Creditor, who, by the Bye, had i&s;&s;ued out a Writ again&s;t me a Month before, but was, through a fruitle&s;s Search, obliged to drop his Action; though really the Man was &s;o good-natured, as to hope I would con|&s;ider
<PB N="151" REF="151">
the Expences he had been at on that Ac|count, and that not finding me had put him to a &s;upernumerary Charge, which I was un|doubtedly &s;trangely obliged to him for! As a Proof how much I thought my&s;elf &s;o, I begged the Favour of him to give me a Re|ceipt for the Money, and when he could pre|vail upon a reprieved Criminal to pay for the erecting of <HI>Tyburn</HI> Tree, becau&s;e he was not hanged there, he &s;hould be perfectly a&s;&s;ured of all Co&s;ts he had been at, in tenderly endea|vouring to confine me in a Pri&s;on.</P>
<P>The Chap, I believe, was glad of his Money, but cur&s;edly vexed he had not &s;taid 'till the Report of an Amendment of my Circum&s;tances, which would have run me to an equal Expence of the Debt, thro' the unnece&s;&s;ary Charges <HI>the dear Man</HI> would have put me to.</P>
<P>When I had given this <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"CERBERUS A SOP,"</Q> I flew, with impatient Joy, to all the Brokers in Town, to buy my Hou&s;|hold Furniture, gave the asking Price for every Thing I bought, and, in le&s;s than three Hours, my Hou&s;e was thoughtle&s;sly furni&s;hed, with many Things I had no real Occa&s;ion for.</P>

<P>But this Affair was attended with &s;uch nu|merous UNACCOUNTABLE Proceedings, i can't blame any Body for being thrown into a &s;peechle&s;s A&s;toni&s;hment. As for Ex|ample&mdash;As &s;oon as I had cluttered an un|di&s;tingui&s;hable Parcel of Goods into my

Hou&s;e, which was after the Hour of Five in the Evening, I re&s;olved to lie there that Night. Beds were to be put up, and every Thing ranged in proper Order. By the Time the&s;e Matters were accompli&s;hed, I was forced to forgoe my Re&s;olution of &s;leeping there that Night, it being near Six in the Morn|ing before I could advance to my Repo&s;itory: Where, when I was imagined to take my Re&s;t, my impatient and elevated Spirits would not let me continue 'till the rea&s;onable Hour of ri&s;ing throughout the Neighbourhood; but, through Exce&s;s of Joy, I aro&s;e, and con|trived fre&s;h Means to unlade me of Part of the Trea&s;ure my Uncle had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me of.</P>
<P>I dare venture to affirm, I had not been two Days and a Half in the Hou&s;e before 'twas open'd; and, as is cu&s;tomary on &s;uch Oc|ca&s;ions, gave away an Infinity of Ham, Beef and Veal, to every Soul who came and call'd for a Quart of Beer, or a &s;ingle Gla&s;s of Brandy. The Faces of many of them I never &s;aw before or &s;ince; but was, from the Number of People that came the <HI>fir&s;t Day, fully convinced, that I &s;hould carry on a roaring Trade:</HI> Though I afterwards found, I had &s;ucce&s;sfully run my&s;elf out very near &s;even Pounds, in le&s;s than twenty-four Hours, to acquire, <HI>nothing at all.</HI></P>

The next great Help I had towards getting an E&s;tate, was the Happine&s;s of the unprofit|able Cu&s;tom of &s;everal Strolling-Actors, who were unfortunately out of Bu&s;ine&s;s; and, tho' they had no Money, I thought it incumbent on me, as they &s;til'd them&s;elves Comedians, to credit them 'till they got &s;omething to do: Not con&s;idering, when that happened, they might in all Probability be many &s;core Miles out of my Reach, which indeed proved to be the very Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Another Expedient, towards the making my Fortune, was letting three &s;everal Rooms to as many different Per&s;ons, but in Principle were all alike, and conjunctive in the Per|petration of my De&s;truction, which I &s;hall define in few Words. One of the Party has very narrowly e&s;caped hanging, more from Dint of Mercy than De&s;ert: Another re|duced to common Beggary, and lying on Bulks; being &s;o notorious a Pilferer, as to be refu&s;ed Admittance into the mo&s;t abject, tottering Tenement in or about St. <HI>Giles's:</HI> And the third is tran&s;ported for Life.</P>
<P>Very unfortunately for me the Water was laid into my Cellar, and I having no De&s;ign of doing Injuries, &s;u&s;pected none; but found,
<PB N="155" REF="155">
too late, that my Tap had run fa&s;ter than the Water-Cock, and my Beer carried in Pails to the two Pair of Stairs and Garrets, which too frequently &s;et the Hou&s;e in an Uproar, as the Gentry, at poor <HI>Pilgarlick</HI>'s Expence, got them&s;elves exce&s;&s;ive drunk, and con&s;tantly quarrell'd: In&s;omuch, that they began at length to impeach one another, by di&s;tant Hints and Winks; a&s;&s;uring me, that they believed 'twould be very proper to ob&s;erve Mrs. <HI>Such-a-one,</HI> when &s;he went about the Hou&s;e, what &s;he carried up Stairs. Pre&s;ently the Per&s;on of whom I was warned would come to me, and give the &s;ame Caution of the other; and, in Half an Hour's Time, the Husbands of the&s;e People would come and do the &s;ame by each other.</P>
<P>The&s;e Hints made me begin to be a little peery, and re&s;olved to look round the Hou&s;e to &s;ee if any Thing was mi&s;&s;ing: In &s;hort, they had taken violent Fancies to my very Candle&s;ticks and Sauce-pans, my Pewter terribly &s;hrunk, and my Coals daily dimini&s;h|ed, from the &s;ame Opportunity they had in conveying off my Beer; and, as I kept an Eating-Hou&s;e al&s;o, there was very often a Hue and Cry after an imaginary Dog, that had run away with three Parts of a Joint of Meat.</P>

As my Stock was thus daily and cruelly impaired, con&s;equently my Profits were not able to make up for the horrid Deficiency; and, as I did not dare to make a &s;econd Attempt on my Uncle, I prudently re&s;olved to throw up my Hou&s;e, before I run my&s;elf into &s;uch In|conveniencies, by endeavouring to keep it, I might not ea&s;ily have overcome: So &s;uddenly di&s;rob'd my own Apartments of their Furni|ture, and quitted 'em, on which the thieving Crew were then obliged to di&s;per&s;e, being de|prived of all future Hopes of making me thus inhumanly their Prey.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t beg Pardon of the Reader for omitting a Circum&s;tance, that happened about a Year before I was thus intendedly &s;ettled by my Uncle. Being, as I frequently was, in great Di&s;tre&s;s, I went to &s;ee a Per&s;on who knew me from my Childhood, and though not in a Capacity of &s;erving me beyond their good Wi&s;hes and Advice, did their utmo&s;t to convince me, as far as that extended, how much they had it at Heart to &s;erve me; and, upon Enquiry into what Means I propo&s;ed for a Sub&s;i&s;tance, I gave the good Woman to under&s;tand there was nothing, which did not exceed the Bounds of Hone&s;ty, that I &s;hould think unworthy of my undertaking: That I

<P>The Woman her&s;elf knew who I was, but her Husband was an entire Stranger, to whom &s;he introduced me as a young Gentleman of a decay'd Fortune; and, after apoligizing for Half an Hour, propo&s;ed to her Spou&s;e to get me the Waiter's Place, which was ju&s;t vacant, at one Mrs. <HI>Dorr</HI>'s, who formerly kept the <HI>King's-Head,</HI> at <HI>Mary-la-Bonne.</HI></P>
<P>I thankfully accepted the Offer, and went the next Morning to wait on the Gentlewoman, introduced by my Friend's Husband, and neither he or Mrs. <HI>Dorr</HI> in the lea&s;t &s;u&s;|pected who I was. She was plea&s;ed to tell me, &s;he liked me on my fir&s;t Appearance; but was fearful, as &s;he under&s;tood I was well born and bred, that her Service would be too hard for me. Perceiving me to wear a melan|cholly A&s;pect, tenderly admoni&s;hed me to &s;eek out for &s;ome le&s;s robu&s;t Employment, as &s;he conjectur'd that I &s;hould naturally lay to Heart the Impertinence I mu&s;t frequently be liable to, from the lower Cla&s;s of People; who, when in their Cups, pay no Regard either to Humanity or good Manners.</P>

I began to be Half afraid, her Concern would make her talk me from my Purpo&s;e; and, not knowing which Way to di&s;po&s;e of my&s;elf, begg'd her not to be under the lea&s;t Apprehen&s;ions of my receiving any Shock on that Account: That notwith&s;tanding I was not born to Servitude, &s;ince Misfortunes had reduced me to it, I thought it a Degree of Happine&s;s, that a mi&s;taken Pride had not fooli&s;hly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me with a Contempt of getting an hone&s;t Livelihood, and chu&s;ing rather to peri&s;h by haughty Penury, than prudently endeavour to forget what I had been, and patiently &s;ubmit to the Severities of Fortune; which, at that Time, was not in my Power to amend.</P>
<P>To be &s;hort, the Gentlewoman bore &s;o large a Share in my Affliction, &s;he manife&s;ted her Concern by a hearty Shower of Tears; and, as &s;he found I was anxious for a Provi&s;ion with her, we agreed, and the next Day I went to my Place: But when I informed her I had a Daughter about ten Years of Age, &s;he was doubly amazed; and the more &s;o, to hear a young Fellow &s;peak &s;o feelingly of a Child.</P>

<P>To her great Surprize, &s;he found me quite a handy Creature; and being light and nimble, trip'd up and down Stairs with that Alacrity of Spirit and Agility of Body, that is natural to tho&s;e Gentlemen of the Order of the Tap-tub; though, as <HI>Hob</HI> &s;ays, we &s;old all Sorts of Wine and Punch, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>At length <HI>Sunday</HI> came, and I began to &s;hake in my Shoes, for fear of a Di&s;covery, well knowing our Hou&s;e to be one of very great Re&s;ort, as I found it; for I waited that Day upon twenty different Companies, there being no other Appearance of a Male, except my&s;elf, throughout the Hou&s;e, ex|clu&s;ive of the Cu&s;tomers; and, to my violent
<PB N="160" REF="160">
A&s;toni&s;hment, not one Soul among 'em all that knew me.</P>
<P>Another Recommendation of me to my good Mi&s;tre&s;s, was my being able to conver&s;e with the Foreigners, who frequented her Or|dinary every Sabbath - Day, and to whom &s;he was unable to talk, but by Signs; which I ob&s;erving, prevented her future Trouble, by &s;ignifying in the <HI>French</HI> Tongue, I perfectly well under&s;tood it. This was a univer&s;al Joy round the Table, which was encompa&s;&s;ed by <HI>German</HI> Peruke-Makers and <HI>French</HI> Tay|lors, not one of whom could utter one &s;ingle Syllable of <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as Mrs. <HI>Dorr</HI> heard me &s;peak <HI>French,</HI> away &s;he run with her Plate in her Hand, and, laughing, left the Room to go down and eat an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Dinner; having, as &s;he afterwards told me, been obliged once a Week to dine pantomimically, for neither &s;he or her Company were able to conver&s;e by any other Means.</P>
<P>When I came down with the Di&s;hes, I thought the poor Soul would have eat me up; and &s;ent as many thankful Prayers to Heaven as would have furni&s;hed a Saint for a Twelvemonth, in Behalf of the Man who
<PB N="161" REF="161">
brought me to her. Her over Joy of her Deliverance from her foreign Companions, wrought a generous Effect on her Mind; which I had a convincing Proof of, by her pre&s;enting me with Half a Crown, and made many Encomiums I thought impo&s;&s;ible for me ever, in &s;uch a Sphere of Life, to be capable of de&s;erving.</P>
<P>In regard to my Child, I begg'd not to be obliged to lie in the Hou&s;e, but con&s;tantly came to my Time in a Morning, and &s;taid 'till about Ten or Eleven at Night; and have often wondered I have e&s;caped, without Wounds or Blows, from the Gentlemen of the Pad, who are numerous and frequent in their Evening Patroles through them Fields, and my March extended as far as <HI>Long-Acre,</HI> by which Means I was obliged to pa&s;s through the thicke&s;t of 'em. But Heaven everla&s;tingly be prai&s;ed! I never had any Encounter with 'em; and u&s;ed to jog along with the Air of a raw, unthinking, pennyle&s;s 'Prentice, which I &s;uppo&s;e, rendered me not worthy their Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>In the Week Days, Bu&s;ine&s;s (though good,) was not &s;o very brisk as on <HI>Sundays,</HI> &s;o that when I had any lei&s;ure Hours I employed 'em in working in the Garden, which I was then
<PB N="162" REF="162">
capable of doing with &s;ome &s;mall Judgment; but that, and every Thing el&s;e, created fre&s;h Surprize in my Mi&s;tre&s;s, who behaved to me as if I had been rather her Son than her Servant.</P>
<P>One Day, as I was &s;etting &s;ome <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> Beans, the Maid came to me, and told me &s;he had a very great Secret to unfold, but that I mu&s;t promi&s;e never to tell that &s;he had di&s;covered it. As I had no extraordinary Opinion of her Under&s;tanding, or her Hone&s;ty, I was not over anxious to hear this mighty Secret, le&s;t it &s;hould draw me into &s;ome Premunire; but &s;he in&s;i&s;ted upon di&s;clo&s;ing it, a&s;&s;uring me 'twas &s;omething that might turn to my Advantage, if I would make a proper U&s;e of it. This la&s;t A&s;&s;ertion rai&s;ed in me a little Curio&s;ity, and I began to grow more attentive to her Di&s;cour&s;e; which ended in a&s;&s;uring me, to her certain Knowledge, I might marry her Mi&s;tre&s;s's Kin&s;woman, if I would pay my Addre&s;&s;es; and that &s;he &s;hould like me for a Ma&s;ter extreamly, advi&s;ing me to it by all Means.</P>
<P>I asked her what Grounds &s;he had for &s;uch a Suppo&s;ition? To which &s;he an&s;wer'd, &s;he had Rea&s;ons &s;ufficient for what &s;he had &s;aid, and I was the greate&s;t Fool in the
<PB N="163" REF="163">
World if I did not follow her Advice. I po&s;itively a&s;&s;ured her I would not, for I would not put it in the Power of a Mother-in-Law to u&s;e my Child ill; and that I had &s;o much Regard, as I pretended, to the Memory of her Mother, I re&s;olved never to enter into Matri|mony a &s;econd Time.</P>
<P>Whatever was the Motive, I am entirely ignorant of, but this in&s;en&s;ible Mortal had told the young Woman, that I intended to make Love to her; which, had I really been a Man, would have never entered in my Imagination, for &s;he had no one Qua|lification to recommend her to the Regard of any Thing beyond a Porter or a Hackney-Coachman. Whether &s;he was angry at what I &s;aid to the Wench, in regard to my Re|&s;olution again&s;t marrying, or whether it was a Forgery of the Maid's, of and to us both, I cannot po&s;itively &s;ay; but a Strangene&s;s en&s;ued, and I began to grow &s;ick of my Place, and &s;tay'd but a few Days after.</P>
<P>In the Interim Somebody happened to come, who hinted that I was a Woman; upon which, Madam, to my great Surprize, attacked me with in&s;olently pre&s;uming to &s;ay &s;he was in Love with me, which I a&s;&s;ured her I never had the lea&s;t Conception of. <HI>No, truly; I</HI>

This threw the offended Fair into an ab&s;olute Rage, and our Controver&s;y la&s;ted for &s;ome Time; but, in the End, I brought in Vindication of my own Innocence, the Maid to Di&s;grace, who had uncalled for trumped up &s;o ridiculous a Story.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Dorr</HI> &s;till remained incredulous, in regard to my being a Female; and though &s;he afterwards paid me a Vi&s;it, with my worthy Friend (at my Hou&s;e in <HI>Drury-Lane)</HI> who brought my un&s;ucce&s;sful Letter back from my Father, &s;he was not to be convinced, I hap|pening that Day to be in the Male-Habit, on Account of playing a Part for a poor Man, and obliged to find my own Cloaths.</P>
<P>She told me, &s;he wi&s;hed &s;he had known me better when I lived with her, &s;he would, on no Terms, have parted with her Man <HI>Charles,</HI> as &s;he had been informed I was capa|ble of being Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies, in ma|naging and conducting the Mu&s;ical Gardens; for &s;he had a very fine Spot of Ground, calculated entirely for that Purpo&s;e, and would have tru&s;ted the Care of it to my Govern|ment.

<P>Though my Poetry may be lame, my De|&s;ign was good; and, as I am &s;en&s;ible it has no other Merit than that, &s;hall &s;ay no more about it, but that it was well received at the <HI>Hay-Market</HI> Theatre, and I was hand&s;omely rewarded by the Per&s;on who&s;e Benefit it was wrote for.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t acknowledge the Story of my Situa|tion at <HI>Mary-la-Bonne</HI> is not properly ranged in my Hi&s;tory, according to the Time it hap|pened; but, as it made up the Number of my Oddities, I have made bold to hawl it in, as I think it is as remarkable as any other Part of my Life before-mentioned.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="168">
After I left my Hou&s;e (which my Uncle's kind Pail of Milk enabled me to go into, though &s;oon after kicked down by his ridi|culous Marriage) I went to the <HI>Hay-Market,</HI> where my Brother revived the Tragedy of <HI>Romeo and Juliet;</HI> and would have &s;ucceeded by other Pieces he got up, in particular by the Run of <HI>Cymbeline,</HI> but was obliged to de|&s;i&s;t by Virtue of an Order from the L&mdash;d C&mdash;n: I imagine, partly occa&s;ioned by a Jealou&s;y of his having a Likelihood of a great Run of the la&s;t-mentioned Play; and which would of Cour&s;e been detrimental, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, to the other Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>While we were permitted to go on, my Brother and I lived together, where I pa&s;&s;ed my Time both chearfully and agreeably: And 'tis no Compliment, to own the Plea&s;ure and Advantage I reaped from his daily Conver&s;a|tion, was the Foundation of that plea&s;ing Content I enjoyed, whil&s;t he was a Re&s;ident at that Theatre.</P>
<P>But as my Happine&s;s was never of very long Duration, my Brother was invited, on the Suppre&s;&s;ion, to <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> Theatre, and I was left to make the be&s;t I could, with the remaining Few who had a Mind to try their
<PB N="169" REF="169">
Fortunes with me: And indeed, to do my Brother Ju&s;tice, he promi&s;ed me I &s;hould have the Advantage of his Daughter <HI>Jenny</HI>'s Performance, as I was left &s;uddenly, and in Di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>As &s;he was a promi&s;ing Actre&s;s in a tender, &s;oft Light, I de&s;igned to &s;et her forth to the be&s;t Advantage, and there was nothing wanting but her Father's Pre&s;ence to carry every Thing on as orderly as before: Though his going was the only Means that rendred it practicable for me to keep the Hou&s;e open; for, when he was removed,</P>
<Q><L>"We did our Safety to our Weakne&s;s owe,</L>
<L>"As Gra&s;s e&s;capes the Scythe by being low."</L></Q>
<P>Yet I was determined, had my Niece re|mained with me, to have been as indu&s;trious as po&s;&s;ible, both for her Sake and my own; and, as I had appeared in &s;ome fir&s;t Characters, was re&s;olved to endeavour at filling up all tho&s;e, with which &s;he was mo&s;t concerned, as our Figures were agreeably match'd; I being but of the Bulk and Stature of mo&s;t of our modern fine Gentlemen, and Mi&s;s <HI>Jenny,</HI> who was a growing Girl of Sixteen, exactly tally'd with me in that Re&s;pect.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="170">
When my Brother governed the Theatre, he got up <HI>The Con&s;cious Lovers,</HI> which we play'd four Nights &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, to full Hou&s;es; in which I appear'd in the Cha|racter of Young <HI>Bevil,</HI> the Child in <HI>Indiana,</HI> and her Father in <HI>Tom.</HI></P>
<P>As I had been not only endured, but really well received in &s;uch a Part, during my Bro|ther's Reign, I could not conceive that his throwing up the Reins of Empire could le&s;&s;en me in the E&s;teem of the good-natur'd Part of the Town, who had been kind enough to af|ford me, perhaps, more than my Share of Ap|plau&s;e: But 'twas otherwi&s;e thought by &s;ome of my DEAR FRIENDS, who prevailed on my Father to &s;end his po&s;itive Commands to his Son to withdraw his Daughter, on Pain of his Di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>I was then reviving an old Play, call'd, <HI>Pope Joan,</HI> in which I afterwards exhibited that Character, to a dreadful Hou&s;e; which I partly attribute to being deprived of my Niece, who was to have performed the Part of <HI>An|geline.</HI> When the Bills were up, and her Name not there, all tho&s;e who were fond of &s;eeing and encouraging her growing Genius, &s;ent back their Tickets, with various Excu&s;es
<PB N="171" REF="171">
for their Non-Attendance; and 'twas debated in the Family, <HI>'Twould be a Scandal for her to play with &s;uch a Wretch as I was. 'Twas letting her down, to be &s;een with me, as her Father was not there to keep her in Counten|ance.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hould be glad to know, what mighty Degree of theatrical Dignity the harmle&s;s Child was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of preferable to my&s;elf, as a Player? I was, when even under Age, received in capital Characters at <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> where I made my fir&s;t Appearance; and in &s;uch Parts, my riper Judgment makes me tremble to think I had, only with an un|cultivated Genius, Courage enough to under|take.</P>
<P>In regard to her Birth, I pre&s;ume I was upon a Par with her; as her Grandfather's Daughter, and her Father's Si&s;ter. <HI>The only Di&s;grace was, my being under Misfortunes; the very wor&s;t Rea&s;on for my Family's con|tributing to a Perpetration of that, which Nature and Humanity &s;hould rather have ex|cited 'em to have helped me to overcome.</HI></P>
<P>In re&s;pect to an Improvement in her Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, I was thought worthy of in&s;tructing her in the Part of <HI>Indiana,</HI> which another of her
<PB N="172" REF="172">
Aunts can te&s;tify the Truth of, who came with her into my own Apartment &s;everal Days for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e the Rea&s;on of an Application to me on that Account, proceeded from my Brother's Hurry of Bu&s;ine&s;s, which prevented his doing it. There could be no other Mo|tive; for, I am certain, there was no Mortal in the Univer&s;e more capable of leaving the proper Impre&s;&s;ions of any Character whatever, on the Mind of tho&s;e who were endowed with the nece&s;&s;ary Talents to receive 'em.</P>
<P>I don't mention this with the lea&s;t Tinc|ture of Di&s;regard to the dear Child; for I am well a&s;&s;ured, &s;he would have been glad to have rendered her Abilities u&s;eful to her un|fortunate Aunt: And I dare &s;ay, <HI>unle&s;s her Principles are perverted</HI> (which, for her own &s;ake, I hope are not,) &s;he &s;till retains in her Heart a &s;ecret Pity for my Sufferings! though to avow it might perhaps hazard the Forfeiture of that Ble&s;&s;ing, Heaven has been plea&s;ed to make her Grandfather the happy In&s;trument of be&s;towing; which I would not for the Univer&s;e be the mi&s;erable Motive of, therefore &s;hall not only excu&s;e, but even ad|vi&s;e her to think, <HI>as &s;ome other of her Re|lations</HI>
<PB N="173" REF="173">
<HI>do, that</HI> I AM A STRANGER TO HER BLOOD.</P>
<P>'Tis plain the rancourous Hate to me had &s;pread it&s;elf to &s;o mon&s;trous a Degree, that they rather cho&s;e to make them&s;elves, I may &s;ay in this Ca&s;e RIDICULOUSLY CRUEL, than not load me with an additional Weight of Mi&s;ery. The low Malice of taking away the Child, as I had her Father's Con&s;ent, I put upon the Level of School-boys Under|&s;tandings; who quarrel with their Play-fellow, from a Jealou&s;y of ones having more Plumbs in their Cake than t'others.</P>
<P>Had &s;he &s;taid, it might have been u&s;e|ful to both: As Time, Experience and Ob|&s;ervation, had furni&s;hed me with &s;ome little Knowledge of the Stage, I would, to the Extent of my Power, have rendered it &s;ervice|able to my Niece; and, I am confident, &s;he would, on her Part, by her Performance, have been greatly beneficial to me.</P>
<P>As I am fooli&s;hly flatter'd, from the Opinion of others, into a Belief of the Power of culti|vating raw and unexperienced Geniu&s;es, I de&s;ign very &s;hortly to endeavour to in&s;truct tho&s;e Per&s;ons who conceive them&s;elves capable
<PB N="174" REF="174">
of dramatic Performances, and propo&s;e to make the Stage their Livelihood.</P>
<P>Some very good Friends of mine have lately advi&s;ed me to this Scheme, which I &s;hall put in Force as &s;oon as I can with Conveniency; and will, on rea&s;onable Terms, three Times a Week, pay con&s;tant Attendance from Ten in the Morning 'till Eight in the Evening, at my intended Academy: Where Ladies and Gen|tlemen &s;hall be, to the utmo&s;t of my Power, in&s;tructed both in the Art of Speaking and Acting; that though they &s;hould never come upon the Stage, they &s;hall be enabled even to read a Play more plea&s;ingly to the Auditor, by a few nece&s;&s;ary Hints, than 'tis likely they ever would without 'em.</P>
<P>If I &s;hould qualify tho&s;e who may de&s;ign to offer them&s;elves to the Theatres, in &s;uch a Manner as may render them worthy the Managers Acceptance, I &s;hall receive a double Satisfaction, both in regard to my Pupils Advancement, and rendering my academical Nur&s;ery u&s;eful to the Ma&s;ters of both Hou&s;es, by a Cultivation of a good Genius; which has been often thrown away, like a Piece of fertile Ground over-run with Weeds, through Neglect or Want of good Husbandry.</P>

When this Narrative is ended, I &s;hall ad|verti&s;e to that Purpo&s;e in the daily Papers; and mu&s;t now beg Leave to apologize for &s;welling out my Numbers with my own Hi&s;tory, which was originally de&s;igned to have con&s;i&s;ted only of a &s;hort Sketch of my <HI>&s;trange Life:</HI> But, on the Appearance of the fir&s;t Number, I was enjoin'd (nay 'twas in&s;i&s;ted on) by many, that if 'twas po&s;&s;ible for me to enlarge the Account of my&s;elf to a Pocket Volume, I &s;hould do it.</P>
<P>In Compliance with &s;o obliging a Reque&s;t, which I receive as a Compliment from my good Friends, I have deferred the Publication of Mr. <HI>Dumont</HI>'s Hi&s;tory 'till this is fini&s;h'd, which will be now in two <HI>Saturdays</HI> more; and I hope that, though the Town is not &s;o well acquainted with the above-mention'd Gentleman, they will be equally curious to become &s;o with his Story, as they have been with mine; and, I dare promi&s;e, that 'twill afford them &s;uch a Satisfaction in the reading, they won't repent their Encouragement of the Author.</P>
<P>As Morality is the principal Foundation of the Work, I venture to recommend it to the Peru&s;al of the Youthful of both Sexes, as

<P>Though I was unfortunate in the Main, yet once in five or &s;ix Weeks &s;omething or other generally happened to relieve my afflicted Spirits; and I met with two Cards running that turn'd up Trumps, which led me into an imaginary Hope that the Mea&s;ure of my Griefs were &s;o compleatly filled, that 'twas they probable would contain no more.</P>

I in&s;tantly did; and, without the lea&s;t Trouble of obtaining Admi&s;&s;ion for the Me&s;&s;enger or Letter, was relieved with &s;e|veral Guineas, enclo&s;ed in a Line of &s;oft Com|mi&s;eration, under the bounteous Hand of my noble Benefactor; the Honour of which, not|with&s;tanding my Poverty, afforded me a more elevated Tran&s;port than the liberal Donation; and naturally claims a real Sorrow for his Lo&s;s, attended with a grateful and &s;incere Re&s;pect for his Memory, to the la&s;t Hour of my Exi&s;tence, to which he has a Right from Hundreds more be&s;ides my&s;elf; having been a univer&s;al Phy&s;ician, and Re&s;torer of Peace and Comfort to afflicted Minds, variou&s;ly op|pre&s;&s;ed.</P>

<P>During the &s;hort Run I was, in re&s;pect of my Salary (which was paid me every Day of Performance) extreamly happy; but &s;o un|fortunately circum&s;tanced, I was forced to &s;et out between Five and Six o'Clock in the Morning, traver&s;ing St. <HI>James's-Park</HI> 'till Mr. <HI>Hickford</HI>'s Maid aro&s;e; and, for Security, &s;taid there all Day, mingling with the thicke&s;t of the Croud at Night to get Home.</P>
<P>The Benefaction of my noble Friend, and Mr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI>'s Salary, enabled me to new rig my&s;elf and Child; that is, upon the Score of Redemption. But this flowing Tide of Joy &s;oon came to an Ebb, both with my Friend and Self; for, in a few Months after, I heard the unplea&s;ing Tidings of his being under Confinement in <HI>Newgate</HI> for Debt.</P>
<P>Compa&s;&s;ion led me to vi&s;it him there, though I had not Power to deliver him from
<PB N="179" REF="179">
that di&s;mal Abode, but in my Wi&s;hes: Though afterwards, had he taken my Advice, he might po&s;&s;ibly have proved me a Friend by endeavouring to extricate him, in bring|ing on the <HI>Hay-Market</HI> Stage, a humourous Piece of his own Compo&s;ing; which, I be|lieve, is &s;till in the Hands of &s;ome of his Cre|ditors, where 'tis of no U&s;e to the Per&s;on who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it; but, as it has Merit, might be rendered &s;o, if properly di&s;po&s;ed of.</P>
<P>I offered this unhappy Gentleman to pro|vide Performers, with my own Service inclu|&s;ive, and to take the entire Management of it upon my&s;elf, without Fee or Reward, unle&s;s his nightly Receipts empowered him to gra|tify me for my Trouble; which, had he but been barely &s;et free, I &s;hould have thought my&s;elf amply rewarded, in being partly the happy In&s;trument.</P>
<P>As to the Money, I told him I would have nothing to do with it; that Door and Office-Keepers &s;hould be of his own providing, but that, if I engaged the People, they &s;hould be nightly paid, according to the Agreement I &s;hould make with them; and for my&s;elf, would, if the Thing &s;ucceeded, leave it to his Genero&s;ity to reward me as he thought proper, which I make no Doubt would have
<PB N="180" REF="180">
been done in the genteele&s;t Manner, had the Affair been brought to any I&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>But this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Gentleman was madly exa&s;perated with the terrible and &s;udden Revo|lution of his Fortune, and in&s;tead of receiving my offered Friend&s;hip with that Regard a rea|&s;onable Per&s;on might have thought it de&s;erved, he rather &s;eemed offended at the Propo&s;al: Which &s;tartled me at fir&s;t, but, on our far|ther Conver&s;ation, I was convinced of his growing Misfortune, and too plainly per|ceived that he was not entirely in his Sen&s;es; on which I dropped the Di&s;cour&s;e, and, with a real Concern, left him that Evening, but re|turned to &s;ee him in about two Days, when in&s;tead of finding him in a more &s;ettled Or|der, he was ab&s;olutely changed from the Man of Sen&s;e to the driv'ling Ideot, nor was there the lea&s;t Con&s;i&s;tency in one &s;ingle Syllable he uttered.</P>
<P>I found my&s;elf too much &s;hocked to leng|then my Vi&s;it; and more &s;o, when I gathered from him an Account, delivered with heart-breaking Sighs and bitter Sobs, that a Per&s;on he had entru&s;ted to rai&s;e a Contribution for him among the Nobility, had run away with the Bounty intended for his Relief; and which would have more than effected it, as there
<PB N="181" REF="181">
was upwards of an Hundred Pounds ama&s;&s;ed for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>This piteous Narration was recounted to me afterwards by a Gentleman, who was his inti|mate Friend, and had &s;erved him to the Ex|tent of his Power through the whole Scene of Mi&s;ery that ended him.</P>
<P>In about a Fortnight after my Interview with him in <HI>Newgate,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing through, I called to know how he did, and was inform|ed he was removed by a <HI>Habeas</HI> to the <HI>Fleet.</HI> As it lay in my Way, I &s;topped there and en|quired after him; upon which I was de|&s;ired to walk up two Pair of Stairs, and in &s;uch a Room I &s;hould find him.</P>
<P>I expre&s;&s;ed to the Per&s;ons who directed me a great Concern for him, and they as natural|ly an&s;wered, 'twas very kind and very good in me, and de&s;ired me very civilly to walk up, which accordingly I did; and, after hav|ing rambled into &s;everal Peoples Rooms through Mi&s;take, I arrived at that where Mr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI>'s Remains only were depo&s;ited, for he was ab&s;olutely in a Coffin, which &s;ome Friend had &s;ent in Re&s;pect to him.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="182">
I conceive a De&s;cription of my Surprize on this Account quite unnece&s;&s;ary, but I really, for &s;ome Time, was very near as motionle&s;s as the decea&s;ed Per&s;on, and in my Heart very angry with the Woman who &s;ent me up to him, without informing me he was dead.</P>
<P>When I came down &s;he very rea&s;onably ex|cu&s;ed her&s;elf, by reminding me, that the Te|nor of our Di&s;cour&s;e con&s;i&s;ted of nothing more than a tender Concern on my Side, for the unhappy Gentleman; and &s;he concluded, that Friend&s;hip and Curio&s;ity had brought me there to &s;ee his &s;ad Remains, he having been dead two Days, and therefore &s;he thought I knew it.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ured her, I did not; and farther told her, I was plea&s;ed to &s;ee he had &s;o hand&s;ome a Shroud and Coffin: But &s;he &s;hocked me exce&s;&s;ively by telling me, he was to be re|moved out of the one and di&s;robed of the other, to be put into one provided by the Pa|ri&s;h: For 'twas a Law, when a Debtor died without any Effects or Means to &s;atisfy their Creditors, they mu&s;t be &s;o interred, otherwi&s;e an Indulgence of being buried by Friends rendered the Warden of the <HI>Fleet</HI> liable to pay all the Debts of the Decea&s;ed, if it could be
<PB N="183" REF="183">
proved that he had &s;uffered it.&mdash;'Tis a hard Ca&s;e notwith&s;tanding, that Humanity &s;hould not extend it&s;elf even to the Dead, without hurting tho&s;e who&s;e Principles of Chri&s;tianity excite them to it.</P>
<P>Thus ended the Life of one who was uni|ver&s;ally admired, and had been for &s;ome Time as much the Fa&s;hion in Families as their Cloaths: But, alas! Misfortunes are too apt to wear out Friend&s;hip, and he was ca&s;t off in two or three Months with as much Contempt, as an old Coat made in <HI>Oliver</HI>'s Time.</P>
<P>Though it was repre&s;ented to his Acquaint|ance, how cruelly he had been u&s;ed by the Per&s;on he intru&s;ted to &s;ollicit them in his Be|half, it was &s;carce believed, even by tho&s;e who not long before had laid him neare&s;t to their Hearts. This is one very remarkable In&s;tance of the Uncertainty of Friend&s;hip, and the In|&s;tability of Peoples Minds who are only <HI>fa|&s;hionably kind.</HI></P>
<P>I was in Hopes, after Mr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI>'s Death, to have got his Figures upon rea&s;onable Terms, and have taken them into the Country, as they were very &s;mall, and rather an Incumbrance to one who did not under&s;tand how to make u&s;e of them; but, when I made an Enquiry
<PB N="184" REF="184">
into the Price of them, his Landlord valued them at Three&s;core Guineas, and the Money down.</P>
<P>That la&s;t A&s;&s;ertion &s;oon ended my Project, as the Reader may conceive; &s;o I engaged my&s;elf at <HI>May-Fair,</HI> and lived on my Pro|fits there 'till the en&s;uing <HI>Bartholomew:</HI> From thence I went into the Country, where I re|mained ('till la&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tmas)</HI> for very near nine Years.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t Expedition was to <HI>Sunning-Hill,</HI> where I had the Joy of playing Capt. <HI>Plume,</HI> and blending it with the Part of <HI>Sylvia.</HI> The Lady who &s;hould have repre&s;ented it, as I &s;uppo&s;e, was &s;o &s;trongly affected with the Death of her Brother <HI>Owen,</HI> &s;he was not able to &s;peak a plain Word, or indeed to keep her Ground.</P>
<P>This gave me an early Touch of the Qua|lity of Strollers; and, but 'twas rather con|venient than otherwi&s;e to keep out of Town, would &s;oon have brought me back again. But, alas! this was trifling to what I after|wards beheld. I have &s;een an Emperor <HI>as drunk as a Lord,</HI> according to the old Phra&s;e, and a Lord as elegant as a Ticket-Porter: A Queen with one Ruffle on, and
<PB N="185" REF="185">
Lord <HI>Townly</HI> without Shoes, or at lea&s;t but an Apology for them.</P>
<P>This la&s;t Circum&s;tance reminds me of the Queen in <HI>The Spani&s;h Fryar</HI> once playing without Stockings; though I mu&s;t do the Per&s;on Ju&s;tice to &s;ay, it proceeded from an unprecedented In&s;tance of even a Superfluity of good Nature, which was excited by her Ma|je&s;ty's ob&s;erving <HI>Torri&s;mond</HI> to have a dirty Pair of Yarn Stockings, with above twenty Holes in Sight; and, as &s;he thought her Legs not &s;o much expos'd to View, kindly &s;trips them of a fine Pair of Cotton, and lends them to the Hero.</P>
<P>I played <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> and, having no Bu&s;ine&s;s with the Queen, had a Mind to ob&s;erve how &s;he acquitted her&s;elf in her Part, being a Per|&s;on I had known many Years, and was really anxious for her Succe&s;s. I found &s;he &s;poke &s;en&s;ibly, but, to my great Surprize, ob&s;erved her to &s;toop extreamly forward, on which I concluded &s;he was &s;eized with a &s;udden Fit of the Cholick, but &s;he &s;atisfied me of the contrary; and, on her next Appearance, I remarked that &s;he &s;unk down very much on that Side I &s;tood between the Scenes, on which I then conjectured her to be troubled with a Sciatick Pain in her Side, and made a &s;econd Enquiry,
<PB N="186" REF="186">
but was an&s;wered in the Negative on that Score: Upon which I de&s;ired to know the Rea&s;on of her bending forward, and &s;ideling &s;o?</P>
<P>She told me, 'twas a Trick &s;he had got. <HI>'Tis a very new one then,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>for I never &s;aw you do &s;o before;</HI> but I began to &s;u&s;pect &s;omething was the Matter, and re&s;olved to find it out. Pre&s;ently the Royal Dame was obliged to de&s;cend from the Stage into the Dre&s;&s;ing-Room, and made a Di&s;covery, by the to&s;&s;ing up of her Hoop, of a Pair of naked Legs.</P>
<P>I own, I was both angry and plea&s;ed. I was concerned to find my Friend's Humanity had extended &s;o far as to render her&s;elf ridi|culous, be&s;ides the Hazard &s;he run of catch|ing Cold: But mu&s;t confe&s;s, I never &s;aw &s;o &s;trong a Proof of good Nature, e&s;pecially among Travelling-Tragedizers; for, to &s;peak Truth of them, they have but a &s;mall Share of that Principle &s;ub&s;i&s;ting among&s;t them.</P>
<P>If a Per&s;on is but a lame Hand, he or &s;he is de&s;pi&s;ed for that; and, 'tis a common Rule, when Benefits come on, to &s;ay among their different Parties (which they all herd in) Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Such-a-one,</HI> to be &s;ure, will have a
<PB N="187" REF="187">
great Hou&s;e, meaning perhaps the Manager and his Wife, who very often are the wor&s;t in the whole Set: And 'tis very &s;eldom that one Couple &s;hall both prove good, but the Merit of the one is forced to make up for the Deficiency of the other.</P>
<P>The lea&s;t Glimmering or Shade of Acting, in Man or Woman, is a &s;ure Motive of Envy in the re&s;t; and, if their Malice can't per|&s;wade the Town's-People into a Di&s;like of their Performance, they'll cruelly endeavour to taint their Characters; &s;o that I think going a Strolling is engaging in a little, dirty Kind of War, in which I have been obliged to fight &s;o many Battles, I have re&s;olutely determined to throw down my Commi&s;&s;ion: And to &s;ay Truth, I am not only &s;ick, but heartily a&s;hamed of it, as I have had nine Years Ex|perience of its being a very contemptible Life; rendred &s;o, through the impudent and ignorant Behaviour of the Generality of tho&s;e who pur&s;ue it; and I think it wou'd be more reputable to earn a Groat a Day in Cinder|fi&s;ting at <HI>Tottenham-Court,</HI> than to be con|cerned with them.</P>
<P>'Tis a Pity that &s;o many, who have good Trades, &s;hould idly quit them, to be|come de&s;picable Actors; which renders them
<PB N="188" REF="188">
u&s;ele&s;s to them&s;elves, and very often Nu&s;ances to others. Tho&s;e who were bred up in the Profe&s;&s;ion, have the be&s;t Right to make it their Calling; but their Rights are horribly invaded by Barbers 'Prentices, Taylors and Journeymen Weavers; all which bear &s;uch &s;trong Marks of their Profe&s;&s;ions, that I have &s;een <HI>Richard</HI> the Third murder <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth with a Shuttle, and <HI>Ore&s;tes</HI> jump off the Shop-Board to addre&s;s <HI>Hermione.</HI></P>
<P>Another Set of Gentry who have crept into their Community, are Servants out of Place; and I very lately &s;aw the gallant <HI>Marcian</HI> as well rubbed and curried, as ever the Actor did a Hor&s;e in his Ma&s;ter's Stable.

<P>How &s;uch Sort of People, without the Help of at lea&s;t a little Education, can pre|&s;ume to pick the Pockets of an Audience, is to me a&s;toni&s;hing, though they have the Vanity and A&s;&s;urance to &s;ay they plea&s;e, but 'tis only them&s;elves; and were the Spirits of departed Poets to &s;ee their Works mangled and

<P>I have had the Mortification of hearing the Characters of <HI>Hamlet, Varanes, Othello,</HI> and many more Capitals, rent in Pieces by a Figure no higher than two Six-penny Loaves, and a Di&s;&s;onancy of Voice, which conveyed to me a &s;trong Idea of a Cat in Labour; all which, conjoined with an injudicious Utter|ance, made up a compleat tragical Emetick, for a Per&s;on of the &s;malle&s;t Degree of Judg|ment: And yet the&s;e Wretches very impudent|ly &s;tile them&s;elves Players; a Name, let me tell them, when properly applied, is an Hon|our to an Under&s;tanding, for none can de|&s;erve that Title, who labour under the Want of a very con&s;iderable Share of Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>In the Cour&s;e of my Travels, I went to a Town called <HI>Cirence&s;ter,</HI> in <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire;</HI> when an odd Affair happened, which I beg Leave to relate, as follows:</P>
<P>I happened to be taken violently ill with a nervous Fever and Lowne&s;s of Spirits, that continued upon me for upwards of three Years, before I was able to get the better of it.
<PB N="190" REF="190">
When I came to the before-mentioned Town, I was &s;o near Death, that my Di&s;&s;olution was every Moment expected; but, after my Illne&s;s came to a Cri&s;is, I very &s;lowly amended, and as &s;oon as I could creep about the Hou&s;e was advi&s;ed, by my Apothecary, to ride out, if I was able to &s;it a Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I found my&s;elf capable of it, I followed his Advice, and had one lent me for my&s;elf, and another for my Friend, the good|natured Gentlewoman who commi&s;erated poor <HI>Torri&s;mond</HI>'s Misfortune, and to whom I am mo&s;t infinitely and &s;incerely obliged for her tender Care in nur&s;ing me in three Years Ill|ne&s;s, without repining at her Fatigue, which was uninterrupted, and naturally fixes on me a la&s;ting grateful Sen&s;e of the Favour.</P>
<P>The Per&s;on who furni&s;hed me with the Hor&s;es, was a reverend-looking Elder, about &s;ixty Years of Age, with a beautiful curling Head of Hair and florid Complexion, that be|&s;poke at once both Admiration and Re&s;pect. His Temper was agreeable to his A&s;pect, ex|treamly plea&s;ing, and his Company entertain|ing; with which he often obliged me, while my Friend attended her Bu&s;ine&s;s of a Play-Night.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="191">
After riding out two or three Days, the old Gentleman perceiving me to grow better, asked me, if I liked the Hor&s;e? which I told him I greatly approved, as it was an ea&s;y and willing Creature. He &s;aid, he was at my Service. I very thankfully accepted the Fa|vour, and, before many Witne&s;&s;es, the Pre&s;ent was made; as al&s;o the other for my Friend's U&s;e, which belonged to a young Fellow he called his Nephew.</P>
<P>He told me, that if I thought proper to quit the Stage, which he imagined, in my weak Condition, was better avoided than pur|&s;ued, he would take me to his E&s;tate, &s;ituate at a Place called <HI>Brill,</HI> in <HI>Oxford&s;hire;</HI> and, if I and my Friend would &s;tay with him as long as either he or we &s;hould live, I &s;hould be Superintendant over his Affairs Abroad, and my Friend &s;hould have the entire Manage|ment of the Family at Home; which, he &s;aid, con&s;i&s;ted only of him&s;elf and Nephew, and about &s;even or eight Servants, that were employed in Husbandry, he being, as he in|formed us, a wealthy Grazier.</P>
<P>'Twas &s;oon re&s;olved, that we &s;hould give Warning to Mr. <HI>Linnett,</HI> who was Manager of the Company, to leave him at the Expiration
<PB N="192" REF="192">
of a Month. This was accordingly done; and, as a Confirmation of his Intention in tak|ing us with him, gave Mrs. <HI>Brown</HI> an old-fa&s;hioned Gold Necklace, with a large Locket of the &s;ame Metal, which altogether, I dare believe by the Weight, could not be worth le&s;s than Twenty Pounds, there being &s;everal Rows, and the Beads not &s;mall.</P>
<P>I de&s;ired the old Gentleman not to in&s;i&s;t on her wearing it, 'till &s;he went Home. It being an old-fa&s;hioned Thing I knew, as an Actre&s;s, People would &s;tare to &s;ee her &s;o equipped; though it was a valuable Gift, but more proper to ornament the Neck of a Country-Hou&s;wife, than a Tragedy-Queen. I therefore de&s;ired him to keep it, 'till we were &s;ettled; and pretended, for fear of af|fronting him, that &s;he might run a Hazard in lo&s;ing it of a Play-Night. He thought my Care was ju&s;t, but in&s;i&s;ted on her laying it up her&s;elf, and I luckily in&s;i&s;ted he &s;hould have it in his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion 'till we went away.</P>
<P>The Thoughts of being &s;o well &s;ettled and provided for both our Lives, was, in Fact, greatly conducive towards the Re&s;toration of my Health; and our Friend&s;hip with the old Gentleman daily encrea&s;ed, as al&s;o with hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Nephew, whom he frequently &s;ent into dif|ferent
<PB N="193" REF="193">
Parts of the Country after Cattle; and, with the utmo&s;t Ceremony, begged the Fa|vour of borrowing my Hor&s;e, 'till he could &s;end an Order to <HI>Brill</HI> for another.</P>
<P>The lea&s;t I could do was to comply with the Reque&s;t of &s;o valuable a Friend, and away went the Nephew; who, at length, happened to &s;tay three or four Days longer than was in|tended, which gave his Uncle a great deal of &s;eeming Unea&s;ine&s;s, that, to all Appearance, was worked into a downright Pa&s;&s;ion, with Threats of cutting him of with a Shilling, for rambling about when he had &s;ent him upon Bu&s;ine&s;s of weighty Concern.</P>
<P>As I ob&s;erved him to be very much out of Humour, I thought it would be but a friend|ly Part to endeavour to appea&s;e the Uncle, for the Nephew's &s;ake; which the old Man took very kindly of me, and bid me want for nothing that might be nece&s;&s;ary towards the Recovery of my Health; a&s;&s;uring me, when <HI>Jemmy</HI> came Home, Fifty Pounds &s;hould be at my Service, to put to what U&s;e I plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>So generous an Offer, unasked, made me conceive that this Man was dropped from Heaven, to be my kind Deliverer from all the
<PB N="194" REF="194">
Sorrows of Life; but, before Mr. <HI>James</HI> came back, there came a &s;udden Order from the Magi&s;trate of the Town, to in&s;i&s;t on the old Man's leaving it at a Moment's Warning, on Pain of being &s;ent to <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> Jail, if he refu&s;ed to obey.</P>
<P>In the Interim, Home comes the Nephew, who received the &s;ame Charge; but they huddled up their Affairs in a &s;trange Manner, and ventured to &s;tay three Days longer, though very little &s;een.</P>
<P>This put my Friend and &s;elf into a terrible Con&s;ternation, for &s;till we could neither of us arrive at the real Truth of the Affair; 'till Mr. <HI>Linnett,</HI> who had heard it from the Town's-People, and, with a frighted A&s;pect and real Concern, came almo&s;t breathle&s;s to let me know, that my pretended Friends were po&s;itively Gamblers and Hou&s;e-breakers; that if we li&s;tened any longer to them, we &s;hould be &s;ure not only to be deceived, but, in all human Probability, be made innocent Sufferers for their Guilt.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Linnett</HI>'s Concern was expre&s;&s;ed with all the Symptoms of &s;trong Truth, which &s;tartled us both with Fear and Wonder, and made us heedfully attentive to all he related.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="195">
We immediately gave up all Right and Claim to our Hor&s;es, and my Friend did the &s;ame to her Gold Necklace, all which were &s;tolen Goods; and, had &s;he been &s;een with it about her Neck by the right Owner, 'tis po&s;&s;ible the poor Soul might have been provided with one of a rougher Kind, and each of us di&s;|gracefully exalted, for being harmle&s;sly cre|dulous.</P>
<P>I afterwards found out, their Scheme was to have got our Boxes into their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; which, as both the old and young Man were frequent in their Vi&s;its to play at Cards with me, by Way of Amu&s;ement in my Illne&s;s, they had ob&s;erved were well furni&s;hed with very good Linnen, and my Friend had ju&s;t received a Pre&s;ent of Cloaths from her Rela|tions. Had they got the&s;e into their Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, they would have proved a tolerable Booty.</P>
<P>But our better Stars &s;hone forth that Time; and though we lo&s;t only an imaginary For|tune, we &s;ecured our Lives, and the little All we were both worth upon the Face of the Earth.</P>
<P>In about a Year after, the old Man dang|gled into the next World upon a Gibbet, ei|ther
<PB N="196" REF="196">
at <HI>Salisbury</HI> or <HI>Oxford,</HI> which I cannot po&s;itively affirm, but that was his de&s;erved Fate; and the young one died raving mad in a Pri&s;on, in or near <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>I thought proper to in&s;ert this Story, not only as it is a particular Occurrence of my Life, but to warn the unde&s;igning Part of the World of heedle&s;sly falling into Company of Strangers, and being taken in by them.</P>
<P>This Man, by his Di&s;cour&s;e and Appear|ance, would have deceived a much wi&s;er Per|&s;on than my&s;elf, as he really wore the venera|ble Marks of bearded Sanctity and Wi&s;dom; but his Principles were as oppo&s;ite to that De&s;cription, as an Angel to a Daemon, having been upwards of forty Years a noted Gam|bler, Pickpocket, and &s;ometimes Highway|man.</P>
<P>I often lift up my Heart to Heaven, with grateful Sen&s;e of its providential Care of us, in preventing the di&s;mal Scenes of Mi&s;ery to which we &s;hould have been expo&s;ed, had this wicked Man perpetrated his De&s;ign; and we might have been made innocent Sacrifices to &s;ave his horrid Life, through Villainy im|po&s;ed, and branded with the Guilt of Crimes we never &s;hould have thought of committing:

<P>After &s;ome private Con&s;ultation with my Friend and Daughter, who were both trem|bling with terrible Apprehen&s;ions of &s;ome Immunities ari&s;ing from this Misfortune, I took Heart, and re&s;olved to &s;et the be&s;t Face upon a bad Matter. As Mr. <HI>Elrington</HI> was not pre&s;ent to receive us, I enquired what Hou&s;es he u&s;ed in Town; and was, to my great Joy, &s;oon informed that there was one in particular, the Mi&s;tre&s;s of which was a great Friend to him; on which I undauntedly &s;et forward, and very luckily found the Per&s;on to be the young Man's Mother who brought us the Money into <HI>Wilt&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>In Mr. <HI>Elrington</HI>'s Name I borrowed the Half Guinea, which, to our general Joy, was immediately granted, and the Man and Hor&s;es di&s;charged; though a &s;econd Thought came into my Head, that as the Company was ab|&s;ent, and hearing but a terrible Account of their Progre&s;s there, I began to be doubtful whether their Faith was &s;trong enough to

<P>This gave me fre&s;h Spirits, and I thought it quite proper to engage our Guide to walk the other five Miles and efcort us to the Players. The Splendour of a Shilling &s;oon prevailed, and we mounted directly; my Friend &s;ingle, and my Daughter and Self double, upon a &s;trapping Bea&s;t, which was of a proper Size to have been rank'd in the Number of Dragoons.</P>
<P>I was not a little plea&s;ed, notwith&s;tanding their ill Succe&s;s, to find Mr. <HI>Elrington</HI>'s Credit &s;o good, and his Character &s;o ju&s;tifiable, that, even in his Ab&s;ence, a Stranger could be intru&s;ted on his Account.</P>
<P>When we came to our Journey's End, Mrs. <HI>Elrington,</HI> who was the fir&s;t Per&s;on we &s;aw, received us with inexpre&s;&s;ible Joy, and gave us a &s;econd Relation of the mi&s;erable State of their Affairs: But, as Lady <HI>Grace</HI> &s;ays of Lady <HI>Townly, She rallied her Misfortunes with &s;uch Vivacity, that had not her Wit been too &s;trong</HI> for my Re&s;olution, I &s;hould

<P>As we were ju&s;t entring the Town, a good-looking Farmer met us, by our Appearance gue&s;s'd what we were, and ask'd if we were not Comedians? We an&s;wered in the Affirma|tive, on which he de&s;ired, if we had any Pity for our&s;elves, to turn back; and, rapping out a thundring Oath, affirmed to us that we were going to &s;tarve, which threw my Friend (who is not the be&s;t Hor&s;ewoman in the World) into &s;uch a Fright, &s;he dropp'd her Bridle, from which Advantage her hungry Steed fairly run her into a Hedge, and dropp'd her into the Ditch.</P>
<P>When &s;he recovered her Surprize, &s;he was for going directly back, without &s;eeing the Company; but when I a&s;&s;ured her the Money would not hold out, &s;he was prevailed on to go forward.</P>

<P>This Ab&s;urdity led us into &s;everal more, for we both took a Wild-goo&s;e Chace through all the dramatic Authors we could recollect, taking particular Care not to let any &s;ingle Speech bear in the An&s;wer the lea&s;t Affinity, and, while I was making Love from <HI>Jaffier,</HI>

Each had his Crime &s;trongly imprinted on his Vi&s;age, without the lea&s;t Tincture of Remor&s;e or Shame; and, in&s;tead of imploring for Mer|cy, impudently and bla&s;phemou&s;ly arraigned the Judgment of the Power Divine, in bring|ing them to the Seat of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>While I was &s;urveying the&s;e mi&s;erable and dreadful Objects, I could not po&s;&s;ibly refrain from Tears, to &s;ee &s;o many of my Fellow-Creatures entered Volunteers in the Service of that Being which is hourly prey|ing upon the weak and negligent Part of Mankind; and, as I too plainly &s;aw, both Age and Infancy plunged in total, undi&s;tin|gui&s;hed Ruin.</P>
<P>About the Hour of Eight, we received the plea&s;ing News of our being ordered to appear in Court at Nine; and, the Joy of being re|moved, though but for a few Moments, from the Sight of the&s;e unhappy Wretches, was
<PB N="218" REF="218">
&s;uperior to that I felt, when delivered from the torturing Apprehen&s;ion I had &s;ome Years before of ending my Life, by Famine, in the <HI>Mar&s;hal&s;ea.</HI></P>
<P>But then the Dread of being remanded back to Pri&s;on &s;uddenly gave a Damp to my Tran&s;|port; but, Heaven be prai&s;ed, our kind Bene|factor &s;ent in the Night a &s;pecial Me&s;&s;enger to be ready in the Se&s;&s;ions-Hou&s;e, with a large Quantity of Gold, to protect us from any threatning Danger.</P>
<P>I had not been in the Pen five Minutes, before I was call'd upon to receive a Letter of Comfort to my&s;elf and Friends; who, tho' they a&s;&s;umed a Gaiety the Night before, were heartily &s;hock'd at appearing at the Bar among a Set of Criminals, the lea&s;t of who&s;e Crimes not one of them would have dared to have been guilty of, though but in Thought.</P>
<P>However, we had the Plea&s;ure to &s;ee the wi&s;e J&mdash;(who, for Dint of Intere&s;t to his Kin&s;man, committed us) march out of Court ju&s;t before our Cau&s;e came on; which ended in a very few Words, our kind Protector hav|ing laid our Plan of Safety &s;o &s;ecurely with his Intere&s;t and Power, we were &s;oon di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed;
<PB N="219" REF="219">
and can never, I think, be &s;ufficient|ly grateful in our Acknowledgements, for &s;o tender and generous a Commi&s;eration of our Misfortune.</P>
<P>'Twas a &s;ecret Plea&s;ure to us, to know that the C&mdash;r was obliged to walk off, having rendred him&s;elf &s;o contemptible to the Gentle|men on the Bench, by dabbling in &s;uch dirty Work, that he was not only heartily de&s;pi&s;ed by them, but &s;tood a ridiculous Chance, if he had &s;taid 'till our Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, of being hooted out of Court: And, I believe, if he were to live to the Age of <HI>Methu&s;elah,</HI> this great Action of his Life would not be forgot.</P>
<P>'Tis no &s;mall Comfort to me, that &s;ome of the be&s;t Gentlemen in and about that Place have dropped his Acquaintance on the Ac|count, as they conceived a Man of Sen&s;e might have employed his Time and Thoughts more laudably, than in giving Countenance and Encouragement to an Action, which was founded upon Avarice, not Ju&s;tice: For I can be upon Oath, and bring many more to ju&s;ti|fy the Truth of my A&s;&s;ertion, that they brought in a Bill of different Charges to the Amount of near Twelve Pounds, be&s;ides a Quantity of Guineas it co&s;t the Gentleman who &s;tood our Friend in the Affair.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="220">
I have often heard of Peoples paying Money to avoid a Jail, but we were &s;o cruelly im|po&s;ed on, they made us pay Half a Guinea a-piece for going into one; and, though we had but twelve Po&s;t-Miles to ride, charged a Guinea a Head for conducting us to <HI>G&mdash;,</HI> be&s;ides the Expences of our Hor&s;es, which they ought to have found us, as we were after|wards informed.</P>
<P>Power, when inve&s;ted in the Hands of Knaves or Fools, generally is the Source of Tyranny, which has been too often experi|enced: And had not our worthy Friend &s;tood firmly by us, we mu&s;t have innocently &s;uffered, for labouring to keep our&s;elves ju&s;t above the Fears of &s;tarving.</P>
<P>As we were not guilty of any Mi&s;demeanor every Body pitied our Di&s;tre&s;s, and heartily de&s;pi&s;ed the Author of it. Our Friend, who gave us partly an Invitation, as he was a Per|&s;on of great Worth and Power, was highly exa&s;perated, and took it as a high Indignity offered to him&s;elf, after he had given us En|couragement to pre&s;ume to object again&s;t his entertaining his Family (which was a nume|rous one) in an inoffen&s;ive Manner; and which, as he rea&s;onably urged, kept many an
<PB N="221" REF="221">
Idle Per&s;on from lavi&s;hing their Sub&s;tance at Alehou&s;es, equally de&s;tructive to their Healths and the Intere&s;t of their Wives and Children.</P>
<P>On our Return from <HI>G&mdash;,</HI> the Gentleman be&s;poke a Play, and removed us out of the Little Town-Hall into the Great One, which was his Property; and, in de&s;pight of our Adver&s;aries, &s;upported us, with a firm Pro|mi&s;e to protect us, in Ca&s;e of a &s;econd Inva|&s;ion, if it co&s;t him Half his E&s;tate: But, as they knew his Power and Re&s;olution both in|vincible, they never attempted to mole&s;t us afterwards.</P>
<P>Our Stay was but &s;hort, after this unlucky Stroke of Fortune; though it was a bad Mat|ter well ended, Thanks to the Humanity of our generous Friend. We were heartily glad when we left the Place; and whenever I go to that, or any other, upon the &s;ame Expedi|tion, I'll give them leave to impri&s;on me for every Hour of Life to come.</P>
<P>The Autumn following Mr. <HI>Elrington</HI> and his Spou&s;e went again to <HI>Bath,</HI> and I was left as Conductor to the Company a &s;econd Time. Ju&s;t before they went, a Plot was laid to draw us into another Dilemma at <HI>Dur&s;ley;</HI> but we were upon our Guard, and luckily
<PB N="222" REF="222">
e&s;caped their Per&s;ecution. In order to get quite out of their Reach, we went into ano|ther County, to a Town called <HI>Ro&s;s</HI> in <HI>Here|ford&s;hire,</HI> where we met with tolerable Suc|ce&s;s, and from thence proceeded to <HI>Monmouth,</HI> in <HI>Wales;</HI> which, though a very large Place, we found it very difficult to get a bare Liveli|hood.</P>
<P><HI>Chep&s;tow</HI> was our next Station, where I met with many Friends, particularly a Widow Lady; to whom, and her Family in general, I am under great Obligations, and &s;hall ever with Pride acknowledge.</P>
<P>I had the Honour and Happine&s;s of obtain|ing the Friend&s;hip of another Lady, who lived within a Quarter of a Mile of <HI>Chep&s;tow,</HI> and often favoured me with friendly Letters when I went to <HI>Abergavenny;</HI> at the End of which Town I left Mr. <HI>Elrington,</HI> with a firm De&s;ign, at that Time, to quit all Thoughts of Playing.</P>
<P>I immediately took a very hand&s;ome Hou&s;e with a large Garden, con&s;i&s;ting of near three Quarters of an Acre of Ground, belonging to my Friend's Papa, a very worthy Gentleman, who had eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in Battle, in the Reigns of King <HI>William</HI> and
<PB N="223" REF="223">
Queen <HI>Anne;</HI> but, in the Decline of Life, quitted the Service, and retired, having a very con&s;iderable E&s;tate, to which his Daughter is &s;ole Heire&s;s.</P>
<P>Perhaps the Reader may think, that the re|peated Rebuffs of Fortune might have brought me to &s;ome Degree of Reflection, which might have regulated the Actions of my Life; but, that I may not impo&s;e upon the Opinions of the good-natured Part of the World, who might charitably be&s;tow a favourable Thought on me in that Point, I mu&s;t inform them, that the Aver&s;ion I had conceived for Vaga|bondizing (for &s;uch I &s;hall ever e&s;teem it) and the good Nature of my Friends in <HI>Chep&s;tow,</HI> put it &s;trongly in my Head to &s;ettle there, to which End I determined to turn Pa&s;try-Cook and Farmer; and, without a Shilling in the Univer&s;e, or really a po&s;itive Knowledge where to get one, took Hor&s;e from <HI>Abergavenny</HI> to vi&s;it the young Lady, and hire the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t do her the Ju&s;tice to &s;ay &s;he advi&s;ed me to forgoe my Re&s;olution, and &s;et before me all the Inconveniencies I afterwards la|boured under: But &s;he found me &s;o deter|mined, &s;he dropped her Argument; and, be|ing of an obliging Temper, forwarded the repairing of the Hou&s;e, that it might be
<PB N="224" REF="224">
ready, at the appointed Time, for my Recep|tion.</P>
<P>To be &s;hort, I went to it; but, that the whole Scene of my unaccountable Farce might be compleat, I not only involved my&s;elf, but the Gentlewoman, whom I have before-men|tioned, that travelled with me, in the &s;ame needle&s;s and unrea&s;onable Difficulties; for which I think my&s;elf bound in Honour to ask her Pardon, as I really was the Author of many Troubles, from my incon&s;iderate Folly, which nothing but a &s;incere Friend&s;hip, and an uncommon Ea&s;ine&s;s of Temper, could have in&s;pired her either to have brooked or to have forgiven.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I arrived at <HI>Chep&s;tow</HI> I began to con&s;ider, that though I had got a Hou&s;e with|out either Bed or Chair to lie or &s;it on, it would be highly proper to &s;eek out a Place of Re&s;t; and, that I might live as cheap as po&s;&s;ible, took a ready-furni&s;hed Lodging for Nights, and wandered for a Fortnight up and down my empty Hou&s;e, 'till Fortune came that Road to drop &s;ome Furniture into it.</P>
<P>I own it, I was &s;ecretly chagrin'd at my Exploit, but did not dare to make the lea&s;t Di&s;covery of it to Mrs. <HI>Brown,</HI> who had very
<PB N="225" REF="225">
ju&s;tifiable Rea&s;ons to reproach me for an In|di&s;cretion &s;he had prudently taken much Pains to prevent.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t De&s;ign was to &s;et forth in Pa&s;try. 'Tis true I had an Oven, but not a &s;ingle Penny to purcha&s;e a Faggot to light it; and for the Materials to make the Pies, they were equally uncomeatable. But I took Courage, and went to inform the Widow Lady of my Intention, and entreat the Favour of her Cu&s;|tom.</P>
<P>As &s;he is, without Compliment, a Per&s;on of Sen&s;e and Di&s;cernment, &s;he very humourou&s;ly asked me all the natural and nece&s;&s;ary Que&s;|tions, concerning the Motive and Means by which I was to &s;ettle my&s;elf, as &s;he well knew I had not a Grain of the principal In|gredient towards exciting me to &s;uch a Re&s;o|lution, or the effecting it.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I was &s;trangely puzzled to an&s;wer her; and, after &s;everal Hums and Haws, told her, I hoped Fortune would favour my De|&s;ign, as I only wanted to get an hone&s;t and decent Living, which was no &s;mall Recom|mendation to her Favour. After having &s;miled at my ra&s;h Undertaking, &s;he admi|ni&s;tred
<PB N="226" REF="226">
that Kind of Comfort I &s;tood mo&s;t in need of at that Time.</P>
<P>To baking we went, and, partly through Pity and Curio&s;ity, we took twenty Shillings the fir&s;t Day. I then began to triumph greatly at my Succe&s;s, and thought it my Turn to upbraid my Friend, for having re|proached me for leaving the Stage.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not forget to in&s;ert a &s;trong De&s;ire I had to go to the Major, on the Strength of my Succe&s;s, and hire a large Field of Gra&s;s, and, in&s;tead of a Bed, thought of purcha&s;ing a Hor&s;e, to carry Goods to the neighbouring Markets; but, that I might not appear more con&s;picuou&s;ly ridiculous than I had done, Mrs. <HI>Brown</HI> wi&s;ely di&s;&s;uaded me from &s;uch a mad Scheme, and a few Weeks convinced me I had no Occa&s;ion for &s;uch a chargeable Conveyance of my Pa&s;try: For, when every Body's Curio&s;ity was &s;atisfied, I found a ter|rible Declen&s;ion of Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>However, I met with unprecedented Friend|&s;hips; e&s;pecially from <HI>Val&mdash;ne M&mdash;s,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who lives at <HI>P&mdash;d,</HI> a young Gentleman of a fair Character, and fine E&s;tate. His Ge|nero&s;ity enabled me to put the main Part of my Furniture into my Hou&s;e; and, as to
<PB N="227" REF="227">
Linnen, and many nece&s;&s;ary Materials be&s;ides, my good Friend, the young Lady before|mentioned, &s;upplied me with them.</P>
<P>As I found one Bu&s;ine&s;s fall off, I re&s;olved to &s;et up another, and went, in one of my extraordinary Hurries, to buy a Sow with Pig; but, to my great Di&s;appointment, after having kept it for near three Months, expecting it hourly to bring forth, it proved to be an old Barrow: And I, to make up the Mea&s;ure of my prudent Management, after having put my&s;elf to double the Expence it co&s;t me in the Purcha&s;e, was glad to &s;ell it to a Butcher, for a Shilling or two le&s;s than I gave for it.</P>
<P>Thus ended my Notion of being a Hog-Merchant, and I having a Garden well &s;tored with Fruits of all Sorts, made the be&s;t I could of that, 'till &s;ome villainous Wretches, in one Night's Time, robbed me of as much as would have yielded near three Guiness, be&s;ides barbarou&s;ly tearing up the Trees by the Roots, and breaking the Branches through fearful Ha&s;te; being well a&s;&s;ured, that the Gentleman who owned them would have puni&s;hed them to the utmo&s;t Rigour of the Law, had they been di&s;covered.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="228">
One Plague &s;ucceeding another, I re&s;olved to leave the Place, and try my Fate in &s;ome other Spot; but, behold! we were run a little aground, &s;o that we were po&s;itively obliged to &s;ell the be&s;t Part of our Furniture to make up &s;ome Deficiencies, and we were once more in a bedle&s;s Condition.</P>
<P>With the nece&s;&s;ary Uten&s;ils for the Pa&s;try-Cook's Shop, and the friendly A&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome of our good Friends, we took Leave, and &s;et out for a little Place, called <HI>Pill,</HI> a Sort of Harbour for Ships, five Miles of this Side of <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI> The Place it&s;elf is not unplea&s;ant, if it were inhabited with any other Kind of People than the Savages who infe&s;t it, and are only, in outward Form, di&s;tingui&s;hable from Bea&s;ts of Prey. To be &s;hort, the Vil|lainies of the&s;e Wretches are of &s;o heinous and unlimitted a Nature, they render the Place &s;o unlike any other Part of the habitable World, that I can compare it only to the Anti-Chamber of that Abode we are admoni&s;h'd to avoid in the next Life, by leading a good one here.</P>
<P>A Boy there of eight or ten Years of Age is as well ver&s;ed in the mo&s;t bea&s;tly Di&s;cour&s;e and the more dreadful Sin of Bla&s;phemy and

Swearing, as any drunken Reprobate of thirty; and he who drinks harde&s;t, and excels mo&s;t in the&s;e terrible Qualifications, &s;tands &s;o mo&s;t in his Father's Favour.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome few that don't belong to the Boats, that are rea&s;onable Creatures; and I am amazed they can patiently bear to re&s;ide, where there is &s;uch a numerous Set of Cannibals. A Name they very ju&s;tly de|&s;erve; for, I believe, there are &s;ome among them, who would not &s;cruple to make a Meal of their Fellow-Creatures.</P>
<P>I have &s;een many a &s;uffering Wretch who has been Wind bound, &s;ent away Half naked, after they had &s;pent their ready Money, who have been obliged to &s;trip them&s;elves of their Cloaths, and glad to part from a Thing worth twenty Shillings to obtain, with Diffi|culty, one to keep them from &s;tarving, and that without any View of ever &s;eeing it again: Nay, their Want of Principle and Chri&s;tianity is &s;uch, that if they out-&s;tay the Means of rai&s;ing a Six-pence for a Bed, they will charitably turn them into the Street, to</P>

For near &s;ix Months my Friend and I re&s;ided in this terrible Abode of Infamy and Guilt; but being ignorant, at our fir&s;t coming, of what Kind of Mortals they were, we &s;ettled among&s;t them, and did not find it an ea&s;y Matter to remove, though we went trembling to Bed every Night, with dreadful Apprehen&s;ions of &s;ome ill Treatment before the Break of Day.</P>
<P>I took a little Shop, and becau&s;e I was re&s;olved to &s;et off my Matters as grand as po&s;&s;ible, I had a Board put over my Door, with this In&s;cription,</P>
<P>BROWN, PASTRY-COOK, FROM LONDON:</P>
<P>At which Place I can't charge my&s;elf with ever having, in the Cour&s;e of my Life, at|tempted to &s;poil the Ingredients nece&s;&s;ary in the Compo&s;ition of a Tart. But that did not &s;ignify, as long as I was a <HI>Londoner,</HI> to be &s;ure my Pa&s;try mu&s;t be good.</P>
<P>While the Ships were coming in from <HI>Ireland</HI> (which is in the Months of <HI>June, July,</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t)</HI> I had a good running Trade; but, alas! the Winter was mo&s;t ter|rible, and if an Uncle of my Friend's (who
<PB N="231" REF="231">
died while we were there) had not left her a Legacy, we mu&s;t inevitably have peri&s;hed.</P>
<P>About the Time the News came of her Money, we were involved to the Amount of about Four or Five and Thirty Shillings; and, if a Shilling would have &s;aved us from total De&s;truction, we did not know where to rai&s;e it.</P>
<P>On the Receipt of the Letter I &s;howed it to the Landlord, hoping he would lend me a Guinea to bear my Charges to Mrs. <HI>Brown</HI>'s Aunt, who lives in <HI>Os'ford&s;hire,</HI> where I was to go to receive her Legacy, which was a genteel one, and I &s;hould have left her as a Ho&s;tage 'till my Re|turn.</P>
<P>But the incredulous Blockhead conceived the Letter to be forged; and, as he him&s;elf was capable of &s;uch a Fraud, imagined we had artfully contrived to get a Guinea out of him, and reward him by running away in his Debt. But he was quite mi&s;taken, as he was afterwards convinced, and made a Thou&s;and aukward Excu&s;es for his Unkindne&s;s when we received the Money, and had di&s;charged his trifling Demands.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="232">
I con&s;ulted on my Pillow what was be&s;t to be done, and communicated my Thoughts to my Friend; upon which we concluded, with|out &s;peaking a Word to any Body, both to &s;et out and fetch the Money, according to Order, from her Relation's, though there was two very great Bars to &s;uch Progre&s;s, in the Eye of Rea&s;on, but I &s;tepped over both.</P>
<P>One was, having no more than a &s;ingle Groat in the World between us: And the other, my having been obliged to pledge my Hat at <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> a Fortnight before for Half a Crown, to carry on the anatomical Bu&s;ine&s;s, we haple&s;sly pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>Yet notwith&s;tanding the&s;e terrible Di&s;a&s;ters I was re&s;olved, at all Events, to go the Jour|ney. I took my Fellow-Sufferer with me, who was lo&s;t in Wonder at &s;o daring an En|terprize, to &s;et out, without either Hat or Money, four&s;core Miles on Foot. But I &s;oon ea&s;ed the Anxiety of Mind &s;he laboured under, by a&s;&s;uring her, that when we got to <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> I would apply to a Friend, who would furni&s;h me with a &s;mall Matter to carry us on to <HI>Bath.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="233">
This pacified the poor Soul, who could &s;carce &s;ee her Way for Tears, before I told her my De&s;ign; which never entered my Imagi|nation, 'till we had got two Miles beyond the dete&s;ted Place we lived in. Our Circum|&s;tances were then &s;o de&s;perate, I thought</P>

<P>As we were on our March, we were met by &s;ome of our unneighbourly Neighbours, who took Notice of my being in full Ca|reer, without a Hat; and of Mrs. <HI>Brown,</HI> with a Bundle in her Hand, which contained only a Change of Linnen for us, on our Travel.</P>
<P>They &s;oon alarmed our Landlord with the Interview, with many Conjectures of our be|ing gone off; and concluded, my being bare|headed was intended as a Blind for our Ex|cur&s;ion: But let their Thoughts be what they would, we were &s;afe in <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> by the Time they got Home to make their poli|tical Report; and I obtained, at the fir&s;t Word, the timely A&s;&s;i&s;tance our Nece&s;&s;ities required to procure a Supper and Bed that

Night, be&s;ides what &s;erved to bear our Charges to <HI>Bath</HI> next Morning.</P>
<P>The only Di&s;tre&s;s I had to overcome, was to procure a Covering for my unthinking Head; but Providence kindly directed us to a Hou&s;e where there was a young Journey|man, a Sort of a <HI>Jemmy-Smart,</HI> who dre&s;s'd entirely in Ta&s;te, that lodged where we lay that Night. As I appeared, barring the want of a Hat, as &s;mart as him&s;elf in Dre&s;s, he entered into Conver&s;ation with me; and, finding him a good-natured Man, ventured (as I was urged by downright Nece&s;&s;ity) to beg the Favour of him to lend me a Hat, which, by being very du&s;ty, I was well a&s;&s;ured had not been worn &s;ome Time, from which I conceived he would not be in a violent Hurry to have it re&s;tored; and, framing an Excu&s;e of having &s;ent my own to be dre&s;s'd, ea&s;ily obtained the Boon.</P>
<P>Next Morning, at the Hour of Five, we &s;et out, and &s;taid at <HI>Bath</HI> 'till the Morn|ing following: Though I remember I was obliged to give the Landlady my Wai&s;tcoat for the Payment of my Lodging before we went to Bed, which I had the Comfort of redeeming, by the Help of Mr. <HI>Kennedy</HI> and Company, and &s;et forwards on my Jour|ney
<PB N="235" REF="235">
with the Favour they were plea&s;ed to be|&s;tow on me.</P>
<P>I never received an Obligation in my Life that I was a&s;hamed to acknowledge, though I have very lately incurred the Di&s;plea&s;ure of a fine Lady, for mentioning a Per&s;on in my third Number, to whom I &s;hall ever think my&s;elf mo&s;t TRANSCENDANTLY OBLIGED; and &s;hall never be per&s;uaded to forget their Humanity, <HI>or to reconcile Con|tradictions, and believe in Impo&s;&s;ibilities.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as I was empowered, by the Help of a little Ca&s;h, we &s;et out from <HI>Bath</HI> to <HI>Oxford&s;hire;</HI> and, in three Days, arrived at the happy Spot, where we were furni&s;hed with that Opiate for Grief, the want of which had many tedious Nights kept us waking.</P>
<P>Our Journey Home was expedited, by taking a Double-Hor&s;e from <HI>Whitney</HI> to <HI>Ci|rence&s;ter;</HI> and now and then, for the re&s;t of the Way, mounting up into a Hay-Cart, or a timely Waggon.</P>
<P>When we returned to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> we met with &s;everal of the <HI>Pill</HI> Gentry, who were &s;urprized to &s;ee us, and informed us how
<PB N="236" REF="236">
terribly we had been exploded, as being Cheats and Run-aways; and though they them&s;elves, in our Ab&s;ence, were as inve|terate as the re&s;t of the vulgar Crew, were the fir&s;t to condemn others for a Fault they were equally guilty of.</P>
<P>I returned the borrowed Hat, and went Home triumphant in my own&mdash;Paid my Landlord, and, as long as the Money la&s;t|ed, was the worthie&s;t Gentleman in the County; but when our Stock was exhau&s;t|ed, and we were reduced to a &s;econd Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of contracting a fre&s;h Score, I was as much di&s;regarded as a dead Cat, with|out the Remembrance of a &s;ingle Virtue I was Ma&s;ter of, while I had a remaining Guinea in my Pocket.</P>
<P>Bu&s;ine&s;s daily decrea&s;ing, from the want of Shipping coming in, and the Winter growing fa&s;t upon us, we had no Pro&s;pect before us, but of dying by Inches with Cold and Hunger; and, what aggravated my own Di&s;tre&s;s, was having unfortunately drawn in my Friend to be a melancholly Partaker of my Sufferings.</P>

let her peri&s;h through my unhappy and mi&s;taken Conduct, which I meant all for the be&s;t, though it unfortunately proved other|wi&s;e; and, that I might not &s;tay at <HI>Pill</HI> 'till we were pa&s;t the Power of getting away, I &s;at down and wrote a little Tale, which filled up the fir&s;t and &s;econd Columns of a News-Paper, and got a Friend to introduce me to Mr. <HI>W&mdash;d,</HI> Printer, on the <HI>T&mdash;y;</HI> who engaged me, at a &s;mall Pittance <HI>per</HI> Week, to write, and correct the Pre&s;s, when Bu&s;ine&s;s was in a Hurry; which indeed it generally was, as he is a Man of Reputa|tion, and greatly re&s;pected.</P>
<P>I believe, if he had been perfectly a&s;|&s;ured who I was, and had known how much I had it in my Power to have been u&s;eful to him, as well as my&s;elf, it had been much better for us both: However, it was kind in him to employ a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Per&s;on, and a Stranger, to whom he could not po&s;&s;ibly be under the lea&s;t Obligation.</P>
<P>Having &s;ecured &s;omething to piddle on, for I can call it no better, I ran back to <HI>Pill,</HI> to ble&s;s my Friend with the glad Ty|dings; and, as it was a long and dirty Walk from thence to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and infinitely dangerous over <HI>Leigh-Down,</HI> which is full

three Miles in Length, be&s;ides two mi&s;e|rable Miles before that to trudge, we thought it better to give up what we had to the Landlord, to whom we were but Eighteen Shillings indebted, though we left him as much as fairly &s;tood us in Five Pounds ready Money; but, if we had offered to have made a Sale of it, I knew their Con|&s;ciences would have given us Six-pence for that which might be worth a Crown or Ten Shillings: So we even locked up the Shop, and went with the Key in my Pocket to <HI>Bri&s;tol;</HI> and, in two Days Time, I &s;ent it back with a Note, to let him know what we had left was entirely his own, for that we &s;hould never more return.</P>
<P>In Truth I have been as good as my Word, and &s;hall continue &s;o; for if Bu&s;i|ne&s;s or Inclination &s;hould ever excite me to take a Trip to <HI>Ireland,</HI> I would go <HI>Che&s;|ter</HI> Way: And if Travellers knew as much as I do of that horrid Seat of Cruelty and Extortion, they would all come into the &s;ame Determination.</P>
<P>Having thus comfortably withdrawn our|&s;elves from this hated Place, we took a Lodging at Two Shillings <HI>per</HI> Week; and, if I had not had the good Fortune to be
<PB N="239" REF="239">
kindly accepted on by a few Friends who were con&s;tantly inviting me, the remaining Part of my Wages woul'd not have been &s;uf|ficient to have afforded us, with other Ex|pences, above two good Meals in a Week.</P>
<P>But Thanks to my Friends, who empower'd me to con&s;ign it all to the U&s;e of one, to whom I &s;hould have thought, on this Oc|ca&s;ion, if every Shilling had been a Guinea, I had made but a rea&s;onable Acknowledgement, after having immers'd her in Difficulties which nothing but real Friend&s;hip and a tender Regard to my Health (which, through repeated Grievances, was much impaired) could have made her blindly incon&s;i&s;tent with her own Intere&s;t to give into, and &s;o patiently endure.</P>
<P>This Bu&s;ine&s;s la&s;ted for one Month exactly, and I found it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, without being trouble&s;ome to Friends; and Mr. <HI>W&mdash;d</HI> not caring to enlarge my Income, I took it into my Head to try for a Benefit, and to that End printed &s;ome Bills in the Stile of an Ad|verti&s;ement, which were kindly pre&s;ented to me by my Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>All was to be done under the Ro&s;e, on Account of the Magi&s;trates, who have not

&s;uffered any Plays to be acted in the City for many Years, but notwith&s;tanding I &s;lily ad|ventured to have <HI>Barnwell</HI> exhibited in the very Heart of it, at the <HI>Black Raven,</HI> in <HI>High-Street,</HI> where I had as many Promi&s;es as would have filled the Room (which was a large one) had it been twice as big: But, alas! they were but Promi&s;es, for in&s;tead of five and twenty Pounds, I had barely four, and abominably involved by the Bargain; in|&s;omuch, I was obliged to march quietly off, and &s;ay nothing.</P>
<P>After I was gone, &s;everal pitied my Mis|fortune; and declared, if I would make a &s;econd Attempt, I &s;hould be made Amends for the Di&s;appointment of the former: But I thought it mighty well as it was, and, as I was &s;afe in a whole Skin, would not run the Chance of being a &s;econd Time deceived, nor the Hazard of being more deeply engaged than I was.</P>
<P>I was &s;o mi&s;erably put to my Shifts, that the Morning after my Malefit, I was obliged to &s;trip my Friend of the ownly decent Gown &s;he had, and pledged it to pay the Players, who came from <HI>Wells</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t me; which, to do them Ju&s;tice, was a Difficulty they were entirely ignorant of.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="241">
'Twas no &s;mall Mortification to me, not to have it in my Power to reward them gen|teelly for their Trouble; and more e&s;pecially &s;o, as my own Daughter was one of the Number, with her Husband, whom &s;he im|prudently married, contrary to my Inclination, about three Years before.</P>
<P>Though I had no Fortune to give her, without any Partiality, I look on her a more advantageous a Match for a di&s;creet Man, than a Woman who might bring one, and confound it in unnece&s;&s;ary Expences, which I am certain <HI>Kitty</HI> will never do; and, had &s;he met with as &s;ober and rea&s;onable a Creature as her&s;elf, in the few Years they have had a Company, might have been worth a comfort|able Sum of Money, to have &s;et them up in &s;ome creditable Bu&s;ine&s;s, that might have re|dounded more to their Quiet and Reputation.</P>
<P>But I fear that is as impo&s;&s;ible to hope or expect, as 'twould be likely to unmarry them; which, had it been in my Power, &s;hould have been done the fir&s;t Moment I heard of the unplea&s;ing Knot's being tied: But, as it is,</P>

<P>As my Child was at <HI>Wells</HI> with her Company, Nature was more prevalent in that Point than Nece&s;&s;ity to fix me there, for there was another Set of People I could have gone to thirty Miles off, a different Road; but, notwith&s;tanding my Di&s;like to her Marriage, I wanted to be as near her as I could, and joined them at <HI>Wells,</HI> where I was very well acquainted; and, as much as Players can ex|pect, well regarded by the Be&s;t in the Town.</P>
<P>About three Years before, I had been there with Mr. <HI>Elrington</HI>'s Company, and we met with uncommon Succe&s;s; but the la&s;t Time the Small-Pox raged violently there, and, if the Ladies and Gentlemen had not been extreamly kind, the poor Exhibiters might have been glad to have &s;hared the Fate of the Invalids, to have been in&s;ured of a Repo&s;itory for their Bones.</P>
<P>'Tis a common Ob&s;ervation, that Evils often produce good Effects, and &s;uch my

Daughter found from the Genero&s;ity of the Ladies, who made her &s;everal valuable Pre&s;ents, which enlarged their Wardrobe con&s;iderably; and, being a well-behaved Girl, that recom|mended her to their Con&s;ideration, in re&s;pect of her private Character; and her publick Performance on the Stage, rendered her very plea&s;ing to the Audience in general.</P>
<P>I humbly entreat to be believed, when, without Partiality, I aver her Genius would recommend her to a Station in either Theatre, if properly made u&s;e of, as &s;he has an in|finite Share of Humour, that calculates her for an excellent Low-Comedian; though &s;he is obliged, having none equal to her Self, to appear in Characters in which her chief Merit con&s;i&s;ts in being po&s;itively a &s;en&s;ible Speaker.</P>
<P>I once &s;aw her play <HI>Horatia,</HI> in <HI>The Roman Father,</HI> and was a&s;toni&s;hed to find her &s;o truly affected with the Scene, where &s;he comes to upbraid <HI>Publius</HI> for the Murder of her Lover, and provoke her own Death from her Brother's Hand. I confe&s;s I was plea&s;ingly &s;urprized, and beg Pardon for degenerating &s;o far, as to &s;peak in Prai&s;e of &s;o near a Relation, who really de&s;erved it; <HI>An Error my Family is not very apt to run into.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="244">
A &s;econd Time &s;he gave me equal Delight in the Part of <HI>Boadicea,</HI> which I &s;hould never have &s;u&s;pected from her uncultivated Genius; but &s;he proved &s;he had one, in very ju&s;tly acquitting her&s;elf in that Character; but yet I had rather &s;ee her in Low-Comedy, as 'tis more agreeable to her Figure, and entirely &s;o to the Oddity of her humourous Di&s;po&s;ition; and I wi&s;h &s;he was &s;o &s;ettled, as to con&s;tantly play in that Walk, which is a very plea&s;ing one, and mo&s;t u&s;eful when Players come to|wards the Decline of Life: For when they have out-lived the Bloom and Beauty of a Lady <HI>Townly</HI> or a <HI>Monimia,</HI> they may make very plea&s;ing Figures in a Mrs. <HI>Day</HI> or a Widow <HI>Lackit.</HI></P>
<P>I wi&s;h the Girl may take this friendly Hint, now &s;he is young; as I am certain, in re&s;pect to her Years, &s;he may, in all Probability, live long enough to make a con&s;iderable Figure in Characters of that Ca&s;t.</P>
<P>I &s;taid with her the Run of &s;ix Towns, the la&s;t but one of which was <HI>Honiton,</HI> in <HI>Devon|&s;hire,</HI> where I had the Happine&s;s of gaining many Friends of Di&s;tinction; and perhaps &s;hould have continued longer, but that I
<PB N="245" REF="245">
received a Letter from my Brother, to inform me, Mr. <HI>Simp&s;on</HI> of <HI>Bath,</HI> had a Mind to engage me to prompt, and undertake the Care of the Stage, incidental to that Office.</P>
<P>As I was heartily tired of &s;trolling, and being too frequently impertinently treated by my Daughter's Husband, I readily embraced the Offer, and &s;et out for <HI>Bath</HI> with my Friend (who had been as often and equally in&s;ulted, by the little In&s;ignificant) and on my Arrival, Mr. <HI>Simp&s;on,</HI> in a Gentleman|like Manner, received me, and lent me a Sum of Money to equip me in my proper Character, which I repaid him Weekly out of my Salary, and thank him mo&s;t &s;incerely for the Favour.</P>
<P>From the Month of <HI>September</HI> to <HI>March</HI> I continued there, but the Fatigue of the Place was more than my Health or Spirits could ea&s;ily &s;upport; for, I am certain, the Prompters of either Theatres in <HI>London</HI> have not Half the Plague in &s;ix Months, that I have had in as many Days.</P>
<P>'Tis true Mr. <HI>Simp&s;on</HI> was Owner, and ought to have been MASTER OF THE HOUSE; but his good Nature, and Unwil|lingne&s;s to offend the mo&s;t trifling Performer,
<PB N="246" REF="246">
made him give up his Right of Authority, and rather &s;tand neuter, when he ought to have exerted it.</P>
<P>The Hurry of Bu&s;ine&s;s in his Rooms, which were more methodically conducted than his Theatre, took up &s;o much of his Time, 'twas impo&s;&s;ible for him to pay a proper Attention to both. By this Means, what ought to have been a regular Government, was reduced to Anarchy and Uproar. Each had their &s;everal Wills; and but one, which was my&s;elf, bound to obey them all.</P>
<P>This any rea&s;onable Per&s;on will allow to be a hard and difficult Task, as I was not in|clined to offend any of them; and though they herded in Parties, I was re&s;olved to be a Stranger to their Di&s;putes 'till open Quarrels obliged me to become acquainted with them; and, in &s;uch Ca&s;es, I was often made u&s;e on as a Porter, to &s;et the&s;e Matters to rights.</P>
<P>This, I confe&s;s, my Spirit could not ea&s;ily brook; both in re&s;pect to my Father, as well as having been on a much better Footing, on a &s;uperior Theatre, than any I was obliged to pay a daily Attendance on.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="247">
I can be upon Oath, during the whole Time of my Re&s;idence at <HI>Bath,</HI> I had not, even on <HI>Sundays,</HI> a Day I could call my own: And Mr. <HI>Bodely,</HI> the Printer, can te&s;tify I have often left fre&s;h Orders while he has been at Church, either for Alteration of Parts, or of Capital Di&s;tinctions in the Bills, without which very indifferent Actors would not otherwi&s;e go on.</P>
<P>I think 'twould have been a greater Proof of Judgment to have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves on the Stage, than upon a Po&s;t or a Brick-wall; and I have often thought, when I have wrote the Word PERFORM'D, it would have been no Error to have changed it to DEFORM'D, of which I have often had melancholly Proofs from a Brace of Heroes, who, I believe, (one in particular) thought none equal to them. And truly I can't but be of their Minds, for two &s;uch GREAT MEN were never &s;een before, and, it is to be hoped, never will again.</P>
<P>As to the Women, the Principal, which is Mi&s;s <HI>Ibbott,</HI> is really de&s;erving of Prai&s;e and Admiration, as all &s;he does is from the Re&s;ult of a very great and uncommon Genius. I own my&s;elf not very apt to be partial, but this

Gentlewoman &s;truck me into a mo&s;t plea&s;ing A&s;toni&s;hment, by her Performance of many Characters; but mo&s;t particularly, in the Part of <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> in <HI>The Fatal Marriage.</HI> She not only drew the Audience into a mo&s;t profound Attention, but ab&s;olutely into a general Flood of commi&s;erating Tears; and blended Nature and Art &s;o exqui&s;itely well, that 'twas im|po&s;&s;ible not to feel her Sorrows, and bear the tendere&s;t Part in her Affliction.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s I never was more truly affected with a tragical Performance, and was rendered incapable of reading a &s;ingle Syllable; but, luckily for Mi&s;s <HI>Ibbott,</HI> &s;he is always &s;o per|fect, a Prompter is a u&s;ele&s;s Per&s;on while &s;he is &s;peaking: And it is no Compliment to in&s;ert what I told her when, &s;he came off; that</P>

<P>I am very certain there were &s;everal People of Quality down at <HI>Bath,</HI> who can te&s;tify the Truth of what I have &s;aid of her; and I &s;hould think it very well worth the while of the Ma&s;ters of either of the Theatres to take her Merit into Con&s;ideration: And if &s;he had the Advantage of &s;eeing Mrs. <HI>Cibber,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Woffington,</HI> or Mrs. <HI>Pritchard,</HI> in their
<PB N="249" REF="249">
different Lights, it would make her as com|pleat an Actre&s;s as ever trod the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stage.</P>
<P>The Merit of this Per&s;on was not a little conducive to the Intere&s;t of the Players in general, which was demon&s;trated in the De|ficiency of the Nights Receipts whenever it happened that &s;he was out of a Play, which indeed was very &s;eldom: But as <HI>Merit generally creates Envy, her Cotemporaries</HI> would &s;carce allow it her, either publickly or privately, not|with&s;tanding the polite&s;t Audiences te&s;tified it by a univer&s;al Applau&s;e, and they them&s;elves proved it by the Odds of their Revenues, when fir&s;t Characters have been <HI>&s;tuff'd up</HI> by tho&s;e who would have made better Figures as <HI>her Attendants,</HI> while &s;he had PERFORM'D THEM.</P>
<P>The Bu&s;ine&s;s in general was, according to all Accounts, that Sea&s;on better than they had known it for many pa&s;t, and was greatly heightened by the univer&s;al Admiration of the Performance of the ju&s;tly-celebrated Mr. <HI>Mad|dox,</HI> who engaged with Mr. <HI>Simp&s;on</HI> at a con&s;iderable Salary, though not more than he truly de&s;erved.</P>
<P>I believe the Comedians found him worthy of his Income, as he not only brought in
<PB N="250" REF="250">
what paid his Agreement, but more than doubled that Sum, which they &s;hared among them; yet, to my certain Knowledge, there was private Murmuring, even in re&s;pect to him, though they profitted by his Succe&s;s, and, in &s;pight of their grudging Hearts, could not help being delighted at his &s;ur|prizing Feats of Activity on the Wire, which he is at <HI>Whit&s;untide</HI> engaged to perform at Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI>'s Wells, in <HI>Goodman's-Fields;</HI> and intends to entertain the Town with &s;everal new Things, which he has never as yet pub|lickly exhibited. I hope, not only in Re&s;pect to Mr. <HI>Maddox,</HI> but in Regard to Mr. <HI>Hal|lam,</HI> who is an hone&s;t, worthy Man, he will be con&s;tantly vi&s;ited by all People of true Ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Soon after Mr. <HI>Maddox</HI> left <HI>Bath</HI> (as Mr. <HI>Fribble</HI> &s;ays) a mo&s;t terrible <HI>Fracas</HI> happened to the States-General of both the Theatres, occa&s;ioned by a mercenary View of Gain in an old Scoundrel, who was chiefly &s;upported by charitable Donations; in which Mr. <HI>Simp|&s;on</HI> (who&s;e Humanity frequently prompts him to &s;uch Acts) had been often very liberal to this Viper, who rewarded him by lodging an Information again&s;t his, and the Company in <HI>Orchard-Street.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="251">
This put a Stop to the Bu&s;ine&s;s for about three Weeks, and was brought to a publick Proce&s;s; but, I believe, an Attempt of the Kind will never be made again.</P>
<P>As <HI>Bath</HI> is the Seat of Plea&s;ure for the Healthful, and a Grand Re&s;torative for the Sick, 'tis looked on as a Priviledged-Place; and tho&s;e who come only to plea&s;e them&s;elves expect a free Indulgence in that Point, as much as the Infirm do the U&s;e of the Baths for their Infirmities; therefore a Suppre&s;&s;ion of any Part of their innocent Diver&s;ions was deemed, by the People of Quality, as the highe&s;t Af|front that could be offered them, e&s;pecially as they, and others of Di&s;tinction, are the ab&s;o|lute Supports of the Place; which, without them, would be but a melancholly Re&s;idence for the Inhabitants, if Cu&s;tom had not made it fa&s;hionably popular, being a Town of no particular Trade.</P>
<P>This Reflection ought to put the &s;tronge&s;t Guard upon them, not to be guilty of Offence them&s;elves, or countenance it in others; which was po&s;itively the Ca&s;e in Relation to this Affair, as it was proved a certain A&mdash;rai&s;ed a Contribution of twenty Guineas to

<P>This greatly exa&s;perated every Per&s;on of Condition; who, as it was an Infringement upon their Liberty of Entertainment, intere&s;t|ed them&s;elves greatly in Behalf of each Thea|tre, and carried their Point again&s;t the in&s;olent Invade of their Privileges.</P>
<P>During the Su&s;pen&s;ion, I could &s;carce walk through the Grove but the very Chairmen had &s;omething to &s;ay, by Way of Exulta|tion, on the Misfortunes of the <HI>poor Show-Folk,</HI> as they impudently and ignorantly term|ed them, not con&s;idering that Play-Nights very greatly enlarged their Incomes.</P>
<P>Among this Set of <HI>two-legged Hor&s;es,</HI> were &s;cattered &s;ome of the new-&s;angled me|thodical Tribe, who ble&s;&s;ed their Stars that there was an End put to Prophanation and Riot.</P>

<P>I very lately vi&s;ited Mr. <HI>Yeates</HI>'s New Wells, and was per&s;ecuted for an Hour with Words without Meaning, and Sound without Sen&s;e.

<P>No Mortal, but Mr. <HI>Yeates,</HI> could have thought of letting the Place for that U&s;e; and, I believe, the fir&s;t Symptoms of his Re|ligion will be di&s;covered, if there ever &s;hould be a Suppre&s;&s;ion of this Mockery of Godli|ne&s;s, in the Lo&s;s of his &s;anctified Tenants, and the &s;ad Chance of the Tenement &s;tanding empty.</P>
<P>He mu&s;t pardon me for this Liberty; but as we are both equall odd, in &s;eparate Lights,

neither of us can ever be &s;urprized or offended at what the other &s;ays or does.</P>
<P>My Warmth, I fear, had led me into an unnece&s;&s;ary Digre&s;&s;ion from my Story; but, I confe&s;s, I think the following the&s;e People &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with the Rules of Rea&s;on and Sen&s;e, I have not Patience to think that any Creature, who is capable of di&s;tingui&s;hing be|tween Right and Wrong, &s;hould li&s;ten to &s;uch Rhap&s;odies of Non&s;en&s;e, which rather confounds than &s;erves to improve their Un|der&s;tandings; and con&s;equently, can be no Way in&s;trumental to the Salvation of their Souls.</P>
<P>If publick Devotion, four Times a Day, is not &s;ufficient for that Torrent of Goodne&s;s they would be thought to have, their private Prayers at Home, offered with Sincerity and Penitence, they may be a&s;&s;ured will be gra|ciou&s;ly received, and prevent that Lo&s;s of Time be&s;towed in hearing the Go&s;pel turned top&s;y-turvy by tho&s;e, who really are as igno|rant of it as the Ro&s;trum they &s;tand in, and who&s;e Heads &s;eem to be Branches of the &s;ame Root.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the Gaiety of <HI>Bath,</HI> they &s;warm like Wa&s;ps in <HI>June,</HI> and have left

their Stings in the Minds of many. I am cer|tain Rancour and Malice are particularly pre|dominant in them, which they di&s;covered in an eminent Degree when the Hou&s;es were &s;hut up, by &s;aying and doing all they could to have them remain &s;o, to the De&s;truction of many Families, who were happy in a comfortable Sub&s;i&s;tance ari&s;ing from them.</P>
<P>I know 'twas &s;ome Guineas out of my Pocket, and though I grew heartily tired of my Office, I intended to have fini&s;hed the Sea&s;on, if this Di&s;a&s;ter had not happened; but the Uncertainty of their Opening again, fixed in me a Re&s;olution to leave them, which was &s;trengthened by &s;ome ill-natured Rebuffs I had met with from the lower Part of the Com|pany, which I &s;carce thought worth my No|tice, having &s;ecretly determined to withdraw my&s;elf from that and the Fatigue, being, I think, more proper to be undertaken by a Man than a Woman.</P>
<P>One Thing I took mon&s;trou&s;ly ill, which I cannot help mentioning: Some Per&s;ons of Fa&s;hion, who had &s;een me in <HI>London,</HI> had a Mind that I &s;hould appear in the Part of Lord <HI>Foppington,</HI> in <HI>The Carele&s;s Husband;</HI> and, at their Reque&s;t, I rehear&s;ed it in a Vi&s;it, which they were &s;o obliging to tell me, made
<PB N="256" REF="256">
them more anxious for my playing it. As a Proof that they de&s;ired it, they communicated their De&s;ign to him <HI>who ought to have been their Commander in Chief,</HI> and he agreed to their Propo&s;al, 'till two of his Subalterns, nei|ther of which were qualified to appear in the Character, oppo&s;ed it; each hoping to &s;upply it them&s;elves, without the Advantage either of that Ea&s;e in their Action nece&s;&s;ary to the Part, or being able to utter a Syllable of <HI>French.</HI> But what provoked me farther, was trumping up a Story of my Brother's having laid an In|junction on Mr. <HI>Simp&s;on,</HI> never to permit me to go on the Stage, but particularly in that Character.</P>
<P>I believe the Town has had too many Proofs of my Brother's Merit, to &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible for me to be vain enough to conceive I &s;hould eclip&s;e it by my Performance, or that he was weak enough to fear it: And though I may be judged to have rai&s;ed my Thoughts to the highe&s;t Pitch of Vanity, in believing that to be the real Ca&s;e of my two Opponents in this Cau&s;e, I am po&s;itively a&s;&s;ured it was the main Motive of their being &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly em|ployed in preventing my coming on the Stage.</P>

the Scenes to attend a Set of People, that, I was certain, whatever Faults I might have in Acting, not one of them, Mi&s;s <HI>Ibbott</HI> ex|cepted, was capable of di&s;cerning.</P>
<P>The Intention of my Playing was framed by my Friends, to give me an Opportunity of recommending my&s;elf to a Benefit, who faith|fully promi&s;ed to exert their Intere&s;t for me; but their Scheme was &s;oon fru&s;trated, through the mean and dirty Artifice of the&s;e two Peo|ple, who, I am certain, ought to endeavour at making every one their Friends, of which I have &s;ome mode&s;t Rea&s;ons to believe they fre|quently &s;tand in need of.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Falkner</HI> very kindly offered to enter into the immediate Study of Lord <HI>Morelove,</HI> that the Play might not wait for him, and was plea&s;ed at a &s;eeming Opportunity of my being more agreeably engaged than I was. But his good Nature is no Wonder, for I mu&s;t do him the Ju&s;tice to &s;ay I never heard him utter, or do a Thing, that was incon&s;i&s;tent with the true Character of a Gentleman.</P>
<P>This ill-natured Di&s;appointment rai&s;ed &s;uch Indignation and Contempt in me, that I as much abhorred to go to the Hou&s;e as &s;ome People do to undergo a Cour&s;e of nau&s;eous

Phy&s;ick; but I &s;oon removed my&s;elf, and, if they will forgive my ever having been there at all, I will promi&s;e them never to do &s;o again.</P>
<P>Before I conclude the Account of my <HI>Bath</HI> Expedition, I cannot avoid taking Notice of a malicious A&s;per&s;ion, thrown and fixed on me as a Rea&s;on for leaving it; which was, That I de&s;igned to for&s;ake my Sex again, and that I po&s;itively was &s;een in the Street in Breeches.</P>
<P>This I &s;olemnly avow to be an impertinent Fal&s;hood, which was brought to <HI>London</HI> and &s;pread it&s;elf, much to my Di&s;advantage, in my own Family; where I was informed it was delivered to them as a Reality, by an Actre&s;s that came to Town, &s;oon after I quitted <HI>Bath.</HI> I gue&s;s at the Per&s;on, but, as I know her to be half mad, mu&s;t neither wonder or be angry at her Folly; yet, as &s;he has &s;ome|times Rea&s;on &s;ufficient to di&s;tingui&s;h between Truth and Fal&s;hood, am &s;urprized &s;he &s;hould meanly have recour&s;e to the latter, to make me appear ridiculous, who never gave her the lea&s;t Provocation to do me &s;o apparent an Injury. My only Rea&s;on for not &s;taying, was an ab&s;olute Abhorrence to the Office I was in, and which I would not again undertake for Ten Guineas <HI>per</HI> Week.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="259">
It happened, at the Time I left <HI>Bath,</HI> there was, without Exception, the mo&s;t deplorable Set of <HI>Non-Performers</HI> at <HI>Bradford</HI> that ever wrecked the Heart of Tragedy, or committed Violence on the Ears of the Groundlings. I cannot &s;ay, with <HI>Shake&s;pear, They were Per|riwig-pated Fellows,</HI> for there was not a Wig and a Half throughout the whole Company; and, I believe, there was not above two Men that could boa&s;t of more than an equal Quan|tity of Shirts.</P>
<P>Bu&s;ine&s;s, they had none&mdash;Money, &s;o long a Stranger to them, that they were in poor <HI>Sharp</HI>'s Condition, and had almo&s;t forgot the Current Coin of their own Country. With <HI>the&s;e plea&s;ing Pro&s;pects of De&s;pair,</HI> I joined their Community; and, as my Mind was un|loaded from the Unea&s;ine&s;s I &s;uffered from a Fund of impertinent Behaviour and everla&s;ting Fatigue, greatly prejudicial to my Health, I fat quietly down, re&s;olving not to repine at the wor&s;t that could happen, for the &s;hort Time I intended to &s;tay with them.</P>
<P>A young Man at <HI>Bath</HI> had a Mind to indulge him&s;elf with a Mouthful of Tra|gedy; but, that he might have a Bellyful at once, gormandized the Part of <HI>Othello,</HI> which
<PB N="260" REF="260">
brought us a good Hou&s;e, and was a very &s;ea|&s;onable Help, for we eat. Our Landladies &s;miled, and we could call about us without the u&s;ual Tremor that had attended our Spirits for a Fortnight before, with the terrible Ap|prehen&s;ions of being an&s;wered with a Nega|tive, or &s;erved with reproachful Doubts of their being ever paid.</P>
<P>A very few Days entirely broke up this disjoined Company, and we herded in Par|ties. My Friend and I went with another Manager, almo&s;t as rich and wi&s;e as him we left; when, after having &s;tarved for two or three Towns, we received a very gro&s;s Af|front, on which I went to the <HI>Devizes,</HI> where the above-mentioned notable Gentleman, with his Wife and a young Fellow, be&s;ides our two &s;elves, made up the whole <HI>Totte.</HI></P>
<P>They concluded we &s;hould play there; but rather than &s;uffer an In&s;olence from &s;uch Mortals, even in the greate&s;t Severity of For|tune, I rather cho&s;e to put my&s;elf to the ut|mo&s;t Inconveniencies I could po&s;&s;ibly &s;uffer. As a Proof whereof; not having a Farthing in the World, I &s;old a few trifling Things for Four Shillings; and, with that &s;canty Sum, &s;et out from the <HI>Devizes</HI> in <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> to <HI>Rum&s;ey,</HI> in <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> which, over <HI>Salis|bury-Plain,</HI>
<PB N="261" REF="261">
is full forty Miles: But as there are no Hou&s;es over that long, &s;olitary Walk, allowed to receive Travellers, we went under the <HI>Plain</HI> through all the Villages, which lengthened our Journey full twenty more.</P>
<P>Our Night's Expences, for Lodging and Supper, came to Nine-pence, &s;o we po&s;itively had no more than Three Shillings and Three-pence to &s;upport us for &s;ixty Miles.</P>
<P>My Friend, as &s;he had great Cau&s;e, began, though in a tender Manner, to reproach me for having left <HI>Bath;</HI> and more e&s;pecially, as Mi&s;s <HI>Ibbott,</HI> Mr. <HI>Falkner,</HI> Mr. <HI>Giffard,</HI> and many more, who came to &s;ee the <HI>Comical Humours of the Moor of</HI> Venice, <HI>at</HI> Bradford, u&s;ed many forcible Arguments to make me return: Which I &s;hould have done, but that I happened to take Offence at &s;omething &s;aid to me on that Head by a particular Per&s;on, who notwith&s;tanding I believe meant well; but being perhaps in a peevi&s;h Mood, as all the World at different Times are more or le&s;s, I per&s;i&s;ted in my Re&s;olution of not going back; and hope it will be no Affront to the theatrical Community at <HI>Bath,</HI> to a&s;&s;ure them from my Heart, I never once repented it, but rather pitied my Succe&s;&s;or for being encum|bered

with a very fatiguing and unthankful Office.</P>
<P>When I &s;et out from <HI>Devizes,</HI> I &s;tood de|bating near an Hour on the Road, whether we &s;hould march for <HI>London</HI> or <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> as our Finances were equally capable of &s;erving us to either Place: But Nature a&s;&s;erted her Right of Empire in my Heart, and pointed me the Road to pay my Child a &s;econd Vi&s;it; and after a mo&s;t deplorable, half-&s;tarving Jour|ney, through intricate Roads and terrible Showers of Rain, in three Days Time, we ar|rived at <HI>Rum&s;ey,</HI> having parted from our la&s;t Three Half-pence to ride five Miles in a Wag|gon, to the great Relief of our o'er-tired Legs.</P>
<P>It may be &s;carce believed that two People &s;hould travel &s;o far upon &s;o &s;mall a Pittance, who had not been from their Birth enured to Hard&s;hips; but we po&s;itively did, and, in the extream Heat of the Day, were often glad to have recour&s;e to a clear Stream to quench our Thir&s;t, after a tedious, painful March; not only to &s;ave our Money, but enable us to go through the Toil of the Day, 'till the friendly Inn received us, where our over|wearied Spirits were lulled by Sleep into a Forgetfulne&s;s of Care.</P>

<P>This they either did not, or were not willing to believe, notwith&s;tanding my fre|quent Repetition of it; and though I pro|mi&s;ed to make them happy with what might revert to me through my little Labours, they injudiciou&s;ly conceived I was doing them an Injury, when, as I &s;hall an&s;wer to Hea|ven, I intended it to turn equally to their Account as to my own: But a want of Under&s;tanding and good Mind on the one Part, and a too implicit Regard and Obe|dience on the other, led them both into an Error they had better have avoided.</P>
<P>I would not have the World believe, not|with&s;tanding my Aver&s;ion to the Choice my fooli&s;h Girl has made, that I would not, in all rea&s;onable Re&s;pects, have every Action of her Life corre&s;pondent with the nece&s;&s;ary Duty of a Wife, which, I am certain, never can or &s;hould exempt her from that &s;he owes

<P>To be &s;hort, we parted; and, 'till I could turn my&s;elf about, I went with another of their Company (who left them, through Fears of the Small-Pox) to <HI>Lymington,</HI> where my Daughter en&s;laved her&s;elf for Life: From thence to <HI>Fareham,</HI> where, under a Pretence of bringing over &s;ome Hands to help us out, we being but &s;ix in Number, my Daughter's Spou&s;e came only with a cruel De&s;ign to take away two of our Hands, in pure Spight to me; but, again&s;t his horrid Inclination, or Knowledge, he did me the greate&s;t Piece of Service in the World, for I made a firm Re|&s;olution never more to &s;et my Foot on a Country Stage.</P>
<P>Since the pitiful Villainy of Strollers could reach one &s;o nearly as one's own Blood, I thought it then high Time indeed to di&s;|claim them: Though, I am well a&s;&s;ured, the Girl would not have been guilty of the Crime of depriving her Mother of the Mor&s;el of Bread &s;he &s;truggled for, had &s;he not been en|forced to it by a blind Obedience to an incon|&s;iderable Fool.</P>

I was mon&s;trou&s;ly a&s;hamed to &s;ee an in|nocent Man, who was the Manager where I was then engaged, led into Difficulties, ari&s;ing from an impudent Revenge on me I did not de&s;erve, which the young Gentleman was too &s;en&s;ible of, and was not more concerned on his own, than my Account.</P>
<P>I prevailed on him to &s;teer his Cour&s;e to <HI>London;</HI> from whence, if his Affairs could have been properly adju&s;ted, I ab&s;olutely in|tended to have returned for a &s;hort Time into the Country with him, from a Point of Gratitude and Honour, to make him in Part Amends for the Injuries he had &s;u&s;tained from my Son-in-Law; and I &s;hall think he has an everla&s;ting Claim, on that Score; to any Act of Friend&s;hip within my Power, when|ever he thinks it con&s;i&s;tent with his Intere&s;t to require it.</P>
<P>This good-natur'd, injur'd Per&s;on, had not only him&s;elf but a Wife and Child, exclu&s;ive of my unfortunate Phiz, to provide for, with|out the lea&s;t Pro&s;pect of doing it; but, as I urged him &s;o &s;trenou&s;ly to go to <HI>London,</HI> I was determined to contrive the Means, and applied to a Friend of his, who very ge|nerou&s;ly complied with the Reque&s;t I made
