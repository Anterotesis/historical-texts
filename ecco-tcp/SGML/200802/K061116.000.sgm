<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THAT I am indebted to Mr. <HI>Ram&s;ay</HI>'s GENTLE SHEPHERD, (<HI>a</HI> Scotch <HI>Pa|&s;toral Comedy,</HI> wrote Origi|nally in <HI>Five Acts</HI>) for the greate&s;t Part of the following Piece, was not owing to my Idlene&s;s, but a Doubt of my Abilities to produce any Thing entirely New of this kind, that might plead &s;o much pretence to Fa|vour: As Nature is the &s;ame in all Ages, and Climes, I thought, the Simplicity of Characters, Manners, Sentiments, and Pa&s;&s;ions, which has gain'd THAT POEM its Reputation, cou'd not prove unenter|taining to an ENGLISH AUDIENCE; which
<PB REF="3">
induced me to turn it into a <HI>Ballad Opera:</HI> and as the Beauties of the Original have been thought many, I have &s;carce ventur'd to make any farther Alterations than were ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, in bringing the Tale within the Compa&s;s of <HI>One Act,</HI> adding to the Number of the Songs, and changing it into the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Dialect, without which, it had not been intelligible to our Auditors; nor indeed had I time to vary it more, my <HI>Be|nefit</HI> being fix'd before I had laid my De|&s;ign, which was plan'd and fini&s;h'd in <HI>one Day.</HI> When I mention my Benefit, I can|not omit the Opportunity of returning my grateful humble Thanks, to All who&s;e Favours I have been &s;o frequently ho|nour'd with, and hope I am not too vain, when I declare, it ever was, and will be, my utmo&s;t Ambition to de&s;erve &s;uch Kindne&s;s, by my frequent Endeavours, whenever I may have Power, (and as far as my poor Capacity will allow) to add to the Variety of publick Diver&s;ions. The
<PB REF="4">
Warmth of my Heart might make me tedious, and impertinent, &s;hou'd I pro|ceed; I &s;hall therefore only add, tho' the CHARACTERS in this OPERA are <HI>low,</HI> I flatter my&s;elf, they'll not appear di&s;ta&s;te|ful to the polite&s;t Circle of our ENGLISH BEAUTIES.</P>
