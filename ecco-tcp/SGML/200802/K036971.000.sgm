<L>SEVERE his ta&s;k in the&s;e degen'rate days,</L>
<L>Who ra&s;hly dares to gra&s;p one &s;prig of Bayes;</L>
<L>The frown of cen&s;ure, and pale envy's blight,</L>
<L>Long damp his ardour, and retard his flight.</L>
<L>In form of critic, lo! where link'd they &s;tand,</L>
<L>With pride and dulne&s;s fix'd on either hand,</L>
<L>Pointing with rugged thorns the painful &s;teep,</L>
<L>They ne'er a&s;cend, tho' round it doom'd to creep.</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="5">Not &s;o, when Greece and Rome a&s;pir'd to fame,</L>
<L>Then critic, and &s;ound judgment were the &s;ame;</L>
<L>The poet &s;ought the gen'rous critic's aid,</L>
<L>And the &s;ame laurel gave them both a &s;hade;</L>
<L>With all the terrors beating at my heart,</L>
<L>A novice feels in fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays of art,</L>
<L>With greate&s;t homage for &s;uperior powr's,</L>
<L>Trembling I &s;eek the mu&s;e's &s;acred bow'rs;</L>
<L>Sentenc'd in fancy, ere my fate be known,</L>
<L>As Churchill's theme I've ra&s;hly made my own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Mi&s;taken zeal, with folly at her &s;ide,</L>
<L>Oft has the Drama and its &s;ons decri'd;</L>
<L>Gave the profe&s;&s;ion faults which nature knew,</L>
<L>And judg'd the many from an erring few.</L>
<L>Strictures like the&s;e for laughter only call,</L>
<L>From their own weakne&s;s they mu&s;t quickly fall.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="6">Let railing bigots, and let pedant fools,</L>
<L>Of morals prate, and precepts taught in &s;chools,</L>
<L>Such clouds di&s;&s;olve at merit's dazzling ray,</L>

<L>GARRICK, &s;tep forward, and a&s;&s;ert your claim.</L>
<L>Here charm'd attention could for ever wait,</L>
<L>Fixt on thy beauties, unconfin'd as great,</L>
<L>And wrapt in vi&s;ions of thy magic &s;kill,</L>
<L>Indulge the tran&s;ports which my bo&s;om fill.</L>

<L>Warm'd, I may tell, as diff'rent ma&s;ks he wears,</L>
<L>We &s;hake with laughter, or di&s;&s;olve in tears,</L>
<L>Dwell on his &s;pirit, judgment, ta&s;te, and grace,</L>

<L>But once behold the wonders of his art,</L>
<L>You'll find tho&s;e drawn by nature on your heart;</L>
<L>To point his excellence, or &s;peak his prai&s;e,</L>
<L>But &s;tamps fre&s;h value on the poet's lays.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next on the line, yet di&s;tant, BARRY &s;tands,</L>
<L>And takes precedence of the tragic bands.</L>
<L>Nor does pre&s;umption only prop his claim,</L>
<L>Once genius warm'd him with her fine&s;t flame.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="8">In love's &s;oft tran&s;ports, or its wa&s;ting care,</L>
<L>I feel each rapture, ev'ry pang I &s;hare;</L>

<L>Who does not find the &s;torm a&s;&s;ail his brea&s;t?</L>
<L>Now worn with years, and almo&s;t quench'd his beam,</L>
<L>He faintly glimmers like the embers gleam;</L>
<L>Yet in the &s;parks of his expiring light,</L>
<L>Proves that the blaze which fir'd him once was bright:</L>
<L>Thus the grand column, or maje&s;tic dome,</L>
<L>Rear'd in the &s;plendor of old Greece or Rome,</L>
<L>Tho' broke with tempe&s;ts, and by time decay'd,</L>
<L>Retain a greatne&s;s, e'en in ruins laid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho' weak the million, and to judge unfit,</L>
<L>Still cu&s;tom dubs them arbiters of wit;</L>
<L>Their breath alone 'tis &s;wells the trump of fame,</L>

<L>This MACKLIN felt, tho' merit's &s;terling &s;eal,</L>
<L>Long pa&s;s'd him current in theatric &s;cale.</L>
<L>Grant him unequal to his daring aim,</L>
<L>Did former &s;ervice no indulgence claim?</L>
<L>Too high ambition might have &s;oar'd for prai&s;e,</L>
<L>But yet 'twas mingled with a wi&s;h to plea&s;e:</L>
<L>Thus far humanity and ju&s;tice plead;</L>
<L>Now let us &s;peak as ta&s;te and candour lead.</L>
<L>Dark was his col'ring, but conception &s;trong;</L>
<L>If hard his manner, &s;till it ne'er was wrong.</L>

<L>His anger fir'd us, and his terror froze;</L>
<L>And more; where quaintne&s;s &s;hut out meaning's day,</L>
<L>MACKLIN threw light with fine di&s;cernment's ray:</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="10">If the&s;e are truths, which envy's &s;elf mu&s;t breathe,</L>
<L>Applau&s;e &s;hould crown him with her greene&s;t wreath.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where, on her native quarry next to light,</L>
<L>Shall the mu&s;e bend her melancholy flight?</L>
<L>Now half her &s;ons are &s;wept by death's fell pow'r,</L>
<L>And &s;carce a gleam of hope remains of more.</L>
<L>O, &s;acred fire! which once with active heat,</L>
<L>In POWELL's and in MOSSOP's bo&s;oms beat,</L>
<L>Where art thou fled? or do&s;t thou only re&s;t</L>
<L>In GARRICK's and in BARRY's feeling brea&s;t?</L>
<L>No, replies genius; I have found a part,</L>
<L>A favourite man&s;ion in a female heart,</L>
<L>Where &s;teady judgment and fine ta&s;te prepare</L>
<L>Their riche&s;t off'rings, to detain me there;</L>
<L>Behold, where beauty, in the &s;hape of grace,</L>

<L>A hand&s;ome figure, with an ea&s;y mien,</L>

<L>No flame of pa&s;&s;ion ever yet he knew,</L>
<L>Or, changing character, appear'd once new;</L>
<L>Per&s;on alone fir&s;t gave him to the &s;tage,</L>
<L>And habit guards him in this ea&s;y age.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>REDDISH wants pow'r, th'emotion &s;trong to rai&s;e,</L>
<L>But his attention gains, and merits prai&s;e;</L>
<L>Tho' voice and feeling &s;mall a&s;&s;i&s;tance lend,</L>

<L>His per&s;on's vulgar, his deportment's bad,</L>
