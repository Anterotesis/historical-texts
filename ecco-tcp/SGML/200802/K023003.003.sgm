<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_MR. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Project to u&s;her his Letters into the World by my Means, was the Foundation of this Scheme of <HI>A Literary Cor|re&s;pondence;</HI> which has been &s;o well re|ceived, that it &s;hall be continued while People of Ta&s;te approve of it: And that will be as long as People of Ta&s;te, who have valuable Performances in this Kind in their Power, contribute their Stores to the Emolument of Mankind. Not but that I am always ready and willing to pur|cha&s;e any Genuine Pieces from &s;uch Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors as expect a <HI>Premium.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;econd Volume of this Work pro|mi&s;ed (be&s;ides Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s) to contain Let|ters to and from Lord <HI>Somers,</HI> &amp;c. notwith|&s;tanding which, Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> in his Spleen, has employed his Sifters to talk his Sen&s;e of the Matter to me; particularly 'Squire <HI>Brocade,</HI> who&s;e Objections, intermixed with my An&s;wers, make a very notable Scene, to the following Effect, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
<STAGE>Enter BROCADE, Sept. 12. 1735.</STAGE>
<SP>
<P>Mr. <HI>Curll,</HI> how comes it that you call this Second Volume <HI>Mr.</HI> Pope's <HI>Corre&s;pon|dence,</HI> when there is &s;o much more of other Peoples: This is a mere Impo&s;ition upon the Town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, be plea&s;ed to read the Title-Page. I began this Collection chiefly upon what re|main'd of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s, and be&s;ides finding mo&s;t of my Cu&s;tomers eager to &s;ee the Minds of Men, e&s;pecially in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Epi&s;tolary Writing;</HI> and having con&s;iderable Supplies of the Kind, I publi&s;hed a <HI>Second Volume,</HI> as you &s;ee; and have Materials of equal Value, and &s;ufficient in Quantity, to make a <HI>Third</HI> and <HI>Fourth.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>D&mdash;n me, I do not de&s;ire to read any Man's Writings but <HI>Pope</HI>'s; he's the only Writer of the Age; his Equal never lived in any Time or Country. There's nothing worth reading in either of your Volumes but what is his.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, It is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;et up my Opinion again&s;t that of Gentlemen who do me the Favour to call at my Shop, but &s;ome of my Cu&s;tomers, who&s;e Judg|ment is much e&s;teemed among their Ac|quaintance,
<PB N="v" REF="4">
have &s;aid that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Share in this Second Volume is the very wor&s;t Part of the Book.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Z&mdash;</HI>s! what do you mean by that? Will you pretend to name any Writer in Competition with Mr. <HI>Pope.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, they do pretend to &s;ay, that the Pieces of Bi&s;hop ATTERBURY in this Vo|lume, are &s;omething beyond Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Compa&s;s: His Style in <HI>Pro&s;e,</HI> his Judgment in the Critical-Ta&s;te, his Heroic Love of his Country, his Vindication of Lord <HI>Cla|rendon</HI>'s Hi&s;tory from an unatte&s;ted Ca|lumny, and his ABSALON &amp; ACHITOPHEL, tho' done when he was a Youth at the Uni|ver&s;ity, are all inimitable by Mr. <HI>Pope.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Judges are Blockheads, there's not a polite Man about the Town reads any Thing but what is <HI>Pope</HI>'s. How imper|tinent is it to publi&s;h that <HI>Ab&s;alon &amp; Achi|tophel</HI> in <HI>Latin,</HI> without getting it tran&s;lated for the Ladies, if it be good for any Thing? What a Pox, do you think Gentlemen mu&s;t be at the Slavery, like School-boys, of con|&s;truing it to them in <HI>Engli&s;h?</HI> It would be well for you if you could pacify Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> perhaps if he and you were Friends, he might be prevailed on to take a hundred Guineas to do it for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I pre&s;ume you have &s;een the Poem, in its <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Original, by Mr. <HI>Dry|den.</HI> I doubt whether the Public would de&s;ire Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s fini&s;hing Hand to that Piece.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Dryden</HI> was a tolerable Poet in his Time, but nothing in Compari&s;on to <HI>Pope.</HI> There's <HI>Le Neve</HI>'s <HI>Will and Creed,</HI> I like well enough, becau&s;e they contain partly my own Religion: But there's his Epitaph in <HI>Latin,</HI> why is not that tran&s;lated?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e, Sir, it contains &s;ome Parti|culars that cannot be &s;o well expre&s;&s;ed in any other Language.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I think as I plea&s;e; but what do you mean by tho&s;e Political Letters of <HI>Addi&s;on, Prior, Harley,</HI> and the re&s;t; there is not any <HI>Wit</HI> in them, &s;urely?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant it, Sir, becau&s;e the Wri|ters of them did not intend it: But I am told there is much <HI>Good Sen&s;e</HI> in them; that they open the Scene of the famous <HI>Partition Treaty,</HI> and the De&s;igns of <HI>France</HI> upon the Death of King CHARLES II. of <HI>Spain;</HI> that they di&s;cover the Importance of a Man who is tru&s;ted with Affairs, and how mere <HI>un homme &s;ans con&s;equence</HI> a Man may be, with a great Employment, if the Conduct of the &s;ecret Springs of Action is placed in other Hands: With many other u&s;eful Le&s;&s;ons.</P>

<PB N="vii" REF="6">
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Mr. <HI>Curll,</HI> you are a great Politician.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very little of a Politician truly, Sir: But &s;ince there are &s;ome Gentlemen inclined to adore a &s;ingle Name among the polite Writers, to the Prejudice of all the re&s;t, and to point me out as Heretical, for being of a different Opinion, it is nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould be able to give &s;ome Rea&s;on for my Di&s;&s;ent; and that, I apprehend, is done to the Purpo&s;e, if I am able to &s;hew the Ex|cellency, the Superiority, of many others over Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> in this Epi&s;tolary Ta&s;te e&s;pecially.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Mr. <HI>Curll,</HI> have you &s;orted your Materials for your <HI>Third Volume.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you make it a Secret, or may we be informed what the principal Parts are to be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I'll inform you with Plea&s;ure; it is no Secret at all, I a&s;&s;ure you. There are more of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Letters to Ladies, particularly her Grace the Duche&s;s of <HI>Buck|ingham&s;hire:</HI> Some very pretty Letters of Mrs. <HI>Manley,</HI> full of true Humour, perfectly picture&s;que, in a genteel unaffected Style, natively plea&s;ant, and, as <HI>Horace</HI> &s;ays, <HI>&s;im|plex munditiis.</HI></P>
<P>There are excellent ones of the late Lord <HI>Lan&s;downe:</HI> They convince the Reader of
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
the Patriot, the <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> the Chri&s;tian, the Tenderne&s;s of the mo&s;t humane Mind, the Politene&s;s of the fine&s;t Gentleman, the Dignity of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Peer, are here united, and &s;hine forth with full Lu&s;tre in the utmo&s;t Propriety and Per&s;picuity of Language.</P>

<P>You flouri&s;h abundantly, <HI>Curll;</HI> why <HI>Lan&s;aowne</HI> was a <HI>Jacobite.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, Sir, you are quite out; read his Lord&s;hip's Character of Queen CAROLINE. My Lord was indeed very young when he wrote &s;ome of the&s;e Letters, and the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was not then landed. But, I pre&s;ume, had it been &s;o, a <HI>Jacobite</HI> might po&s;&s;ibly be a Man of Wit; for Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> is allowed to be &s;o, tho' he owns him&s;elf a Papi&s;t. But here are Letters of my Lord's, that &s;hew other Sort of Sentiments at a riper Age, with Regard to the Revolution Settlement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, are there any other Writers in your Third Volume.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, Sir, we are only got for|ward 110 Pages, and then we pre&s;ent you an invaluable Tract of Mr. <HI>Wal&s;h</HI>'s: Be plea&s;ed, Sir, to read Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Opinion of him and of this Piece.</P>

<P><HI>Wycherley</HI> and <HI>Pope</HI> for That! But hear, Sir, how Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> &s;ings:<Q><L>To <HI>Wal&s;h</HI> the Wit of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> was known,</L>
<L>And ev'ry Author's Merit but his own.</L></Q></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, The <HI>Ho&s;pital of Fools</HI> is an Imitation of <HI>Lucian,</HI> by Mr. <HI>Wal&s;h,</HI> and Gentlemen of the be&s;t Ta&s;te among my Cu&s;|tomers agree, that <HI>Lucian</HI> wrote nothing equal to it.

<HEAD>To Mr. CURLL.</HEAD>
<P>I Have read the Three Volumes of your <HI>Li|terary Corre&s;pondence</HI> with Satisfaction. A Collection of good Letters is much wanted in our Language. The <HI>French</HI> have &s;everal; and I think they outdo us in no other Article of polite Literature. Ar|tificial Letters, written on Purpo&s;e to be publi&s;hed, are apt to fall &s;hort of the vivid Force and Openne&s;s found in the unbo&s;om|ing of Friend to Friend; therefore it is ex|treamly difficult to imitate well, as it al&s;o is to obtain the Papers of a valuable real Cor|re&s;pondence.</P>
<P>If Gentlemen could be &s;atisfied, there would be no Endeavours to know how Letters came to the Pre&s;s, I am per&s;uaded, our free, learned, polite Age and Country, might ea&s;ily find you a genuine Collection in the be&s;t Ta&s;te.</P>
<P>For my own Part I will not have any Doubt of your Conduct in this Re&s;pect; therefore you now receive inclo&s;ed the very Mind of a Man of Sen&s;e and Rank in his Country, upon public Affairs, from the Re|volution to the Year 1730. Mo&s;t of them were Letters to the late Bi&s;hop <HI>Atterbury,</HI>
<PB N="xii" REF="11">
and the re&s;t, to an intimate Friend of his, who died before him.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop, a few Months before his Death, lent them to a Nobleman in <HI>France</HI> (from whom I had them) and at the &s;ame Time he told him, <HI>they were written by the hone&s;te&s;t Whig of his Acquaintance;</HI> that he differ'd from the Writer upon &s;everal Points, but look'd upon him to be a good <HI>Engli&s;h|man</HI> in the main; that he (the Bi&s;hop) had been cen&s;ur'd by his Enemies as a hot Par|ty-man, but that he could always reli&s;h the Corre&s;pondence of a Per&s;on of Sincerity and Honour, though of different Sentiments in Politics or Religion; and that if he did not live to a&s;k for the&s;e Letters again (as he found him&s;elf in a declining Condition) he de&s;ired they might not be lo&s;t, becau&s;e there was <HI>much Truth and good Sen&s;e in them;</HI> but in&s;i&s;ted, <HI>that if they went abroad, it would be in &s;uch a Manner as not to prejudice the Writer of them in any Branch of his Family, which might have Occa&s;ion for the Counte|nance of Men in Power.</HI></P>
<P>If you think it agreeable to your Scheme, you may publi&s;h them; if not, I wi&s;h you Supplies more to your Purpo&s;e, and am,</P>

<P>_HAving no le&s;s Admiration for your Courage and good Nature, than Sympathy with your Grief; I am &s;o highly &s;en&s;ible of both the one and the other, that if I were capable to render you tho&s;e Com|mendations which were ju&s;tly due to you, and that Comfort whereof you &s;tand in need, I mu&s;t confe&s;s I &s;hould be much

troubled where to begin; for what Obli|gations can be more equally inforcing, than to render to &s;o eminent a Virtue the Ho|nour it merits; and to &s;o violent Affliction the Comfort it requires? But I am to blame to put a Di&s;tance between the&s;e two things, &s;ince Charity has &s;o perfectly united them, that the fond A&s;&s;i&s;tance you afforded your late Brother, &s;hould now prove an extra|ordinary Comfort to you, &s;ince God will be&s;tow that on you out of Ju&s;tice, which others obtain out of his Indulgence; his in|finite Goodne&s;s being &s;uch, as will not &s;uf|fer, unrewarded, &s;o exemplary an Act of Tenderne&s;s, as what, thro' a Contempt of your own Life, engaged you in the Offices of the be&s;t and tendere&s;t Si&s;ter in the World, beyond the Limits of all Obligations; and by an admirable Con&s;tancy, made you a&s;|&s;ur'd amid&s;t a Danger that terrifies the mo&s;t daring.</P>

<P>I Here &s;end you the Elegy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This, with &s;ome other Poetical Pieces, will be found in our FOURTH Volume.</NOTE>, which you have but too often demanded of me, and which heretofore hath indeed been heard by others, but, till now, hath not been read by any.</P>
<P>It is my Wi&s;h, that the &s;ame Fortune may in this happen to me as hath befallen you; who, after you have for &s;o long time concealed the noble&s;t things in the World, have in the Di&s;covery of it, dazled all tho&s;e that have &s;een it. But it is an over-great Fondne&s;s for my own Ver&s;es, to wi&s;h them that Advantage, nor indeed &s;hould I wi&s;h them better, &s;ince they were not made for you: If you think them very ill, you are &s;o much the more obliged to me for them, in that knowing it as well as you, yet I have not forborn &s;ending them to you. And, to deal freely with you, a le&s;s Power than what you have within the&s;e few Days gained upon me, would not have been &s;uf|ficient
<PB N="xxii" REF="21">
to have prevailed with me to do it: And, without your Command, Madam, they had never known any other Place than that of my own Memory. But it is high time it were delivered of them, to make room for &s;omething more delightful; I mean that which Mrs. **** had the Grace to acquaint me with the other Day, and which fills it &s;o much at pre&s;ent, that I doubt whether there be Place for any thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>I perceive, Madam, that where it was my De&s;ign to &s;end you a Letter of Excu&s;e and Compliment, I am fallen into one of Love; but I wi&s;h all the other Defects you &s;hall find in it, were as pardonable as that. In the mean time let me a&s;&s;ure you, that I have not of a long time been &s;o engaged, and that there are many in the World to whom I would not &s;ay &s;o much, even tho' they held a Dagger at my Throat.</P>
<P>But, &s;ince there is no fear of any Scan|dal, you are obliged, Madam, at lea&s;t in my Opinion, to look favourably on tho&s;e Elements of Affection, were it but to &s;ee, how I &s;hould behave my&s;elf, if I &s;hould fall in Love; and, if I were permitted, what might be the Con&s;equence of it.</P>

<P>THO' my Liberty were, as you &s;ay, greater than <HI>Alexander</HI>'s, it were more than recompenced by the Thanks you have been plea&s;ed to return it. Even his Ambition, as in&s;atiable as it was, would, by &s;o extraordinary a Favour, have been li|mited. He would have valued this Honour more highly than the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Diadem, and he would not have envied <HI>Achilles</HI> the Prai&s;es of <HI>Homer,</HI> might he have Yours. In like manner, Madam, con&s;idering the Reputation you do me, if I envy his, it is not &s;o much that which he hath acquired, as what you have be&s;towed on him, and he hath received no Honours which I do not look upon below my own, unle&s;s it be that you do him, when you call him your Gal|lant. Neither his own Vanity nor his Flat|terers have ever advanced any thing &s;o ad|vantageous to him, and the Quality of the Son of <HI>Jupiter Ammon</HI> was not &s;o glorious as that. But, if nothing can cure me of
<PB N="xxiv" REF="23">
the Jealou&s;y I have of it, yet, Madam, knowing you as I do, I am confident, if you do him that Favour, it is not &s;o much becau&s;e he is the greate&s;t of Mankind, as becau&s;e it is Two Thou&s;and Years &s;ince he was.</P>
<P>However it be, we may &s;ee, in this, the Greatne&s;s of his Fortune, which not able to for&s;ake him &s;o many Years after his Death, adds to his Conque&s;ts a Per&s;on which cele|brates them more than the Wife and Daugh|ter of <HI>Darius,</HI> and hath re-infu&s;ed into him a Soul greater than that of the World he hath &s;ubdued.</P>
<P>I &s;hould fear, by your Example, to write in too high a Stile, but can a Man aim at one too high, &s;peaking of you, and <HI>Alexan|der?</HI> I be&s;eech you, Madam, to a&s;&s;ure your &s;elf I have for you the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ion which you have for him, and that the Admiration of your Virtues &s;hall ever engage me to be, Madam,</P>

<P>I Could never believe it po&s;&s;ible that the Receipt of a Letter from you &s;hould add to my Affliction, or that you could have po&s;&s;ibly &s;ent me &s;uch bad News, as that you could not comfort me at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>I thought my Unhappine&s;s at &s;uch a Point as could not admit of any Addition, and that &s;ince you were able &s;omething to &s;trengthen my Patience to endure the Ab|&s;ence of your Mother and You, there could not be any Misfortune which You could not have encouraged me to &s;uffer. But give me leave to tell you, that I have found the contrary in the Affliction I have for the Death of Mrs. <HI>A****,</HI> which hath been heavy enough to cru&s;h me, and want|ed not much to &s;pend the Remainder of my Patience.</P>
<P><PB N="xxvi" REF="25">
You may ea&s;ily judge, Madam, what an exce&s;&s;ive Grief it mu&s;t needs be to me to have lo&s;t a Friend &s;o good, &s;o &s;prightly and &s;o accompli&s;hed as &s;he, and one that hav|ing always given me &s;o many Expre&s;&s;ions of her Affection, would needs do &s;ome|thing when &s;he had not many Hours to continue here. But tho' I reflected not on my own Concernments, yet could I not but infinitely regret a Per&s;on by whom you were infinitely beloved; and who, among many particular Endowments, had that of knowing you as much as may be, and e&s;teeming you above all things. Yet I mu&s;t confe&s;s, if this Di&s;turbance can admit of any Remi&s;&s;ion, it is to reflect on the Con|&s;tancy &s;he expre&s;&s;ed, and the Fortitude wherewith &s;he hath &s;uffered a Thing whereof the Name would make her trem|ble at any time.</P>
<P>I am extremely comforted to under&s;tand, that at her Death, &s;he had tho&s;e Qualities which only &s;he wanted in her Life, and that &s;he &s;o opportunely found Courage and Re&s;olution. When I con&s;ider it &s;eriou&s;ly, it is &s;omewhat again&s;t my Con&s;cience to bemoan her, and methinks it &s;peaks an over-intere&s;ted Affection, to be &s;ad becau&s;e &s;he hath left us to better her Condition, and is gone into the other World, (<HI>from</HI>
<PB N="xxvii" REF="26">
<HI>who&s;e Bourne no Traveller returns</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">HAMLET.</NOTE>) to find that Quiet &s;he could never meet with in this.</P>
<P>I very heartily entertain the Exhortations you give me thereupon, which is, often to con over a Le&s;&s;on &s;o profitable and nece&s;|&s;ary, and to prepare my&s;elf for the like one Day; I know how to make my Advantage of your Remon&s;trance. The Mi&s;eries we have run thro' all this while is no &s;mall Preparation for it: There's no better Lec|ture to in&s;truct a Man how to die well, than not to take much Plea&s;ure in living.</P>
<P>But if it be not impo&s;&s;ible for the Hopes that Fortune propo&s;es to prove effectual; if after &s;o many Years, we may pre&s;ume to expect &s;ome few fair Days, be plea&s;ed to give me leave, Madam, to entertain Thoughts more diverting than tho&s;e of Death; and if it be likely that we are &s;hortly to &s;ee one another, let me not fall out with my Life.</P>
<P>Where you &s;ay, <HI>You think me de&s;tined to great Things,</HI> you give &s;o great Security of my Life, and &s;o happy a Pre&s;age of the Adventures that &s;hall happen to me, that I &s;hall not be &s;orry for its Continuance yet

a while. For my part, if De&s;tiny doth promi&s;e me any thing that is good, I a&s;&s;ure you I will do my utmo&s;t to get it. I will contribute all I can thereto, that <HI>your Pro|phe&s;ies may be fulfilled.</HI> In the mean time, I be&s;eech you to be confident, that of all the Favours I can beg of Fortune, what I mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ire is, that &s;he would do for you what &s;he ought, and for my&s;elf, only afford me the Means to acquaint you with the Pa&s;&s;ion which obliges me to be &s;o much,</P>

<HEAD>A LETTER To Mr. P***</HEAD>
<P>_REJOICE with me, my Friend, there is Probability of mine Ad|vancement, this is the Reign of Expectancy. Never, if not now, &s;hall I become con&s;idera|ble: Places of National and mighty Tru&s;t, are given to tho&s;e the World will tru&s;t no longer. Emulous of the <HI>Roman</HI> Simplicity, our Nobility, like &s;o many CINCINNA|TUS's, &s;eem to be taken from the Plough; our Clergy, repre&s;enting the Mechanic Pi&s;|catory Founders of Chri&s;tianity, are Men of mean De&s;cent, and altogether as emi|nent for their Ignorance. But as the uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion of their Apo&s;tle|&s;hip is mo&s;t undeniable, the Lord in|&s;pire the&s;e with tho&s;e. <HI>Saul</HI> from a Ten|der
<PB N="30" REF="61">
of his Father's ASSES, became a ten|der Father to the People <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and left his former Care. <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> too was called to be a King, but he retained his ASSES; &s;ome he made Judges, &s;ome Bi&s;hops, and &s;ome Amba&s;&s;adors, which occa&s;ioned the Scoffers to &s;ay, that <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> only wore the <HI>Lion</HI>'s Skin. What led me, I believe, to this Subject, was the hearing of Papers now crying about the Streets, intitled, <HI>The Con|gre&s;s of A&s;&s;es;</HI> which naturally brought to my Remembrance, many Folks and Occur|rences, both at Home and Abroad. We have a Poet Laureat here, Thanks to my Lord Chamberlain, now grown old, who is twice a-Year brought forth to be kicked at by his Brethren.</P>

<P>If Dean <HI>B&mdash;</HI> or Doctor <HI>S&mdash;</HI> pride them&s;elves too highly on the Linguo&s;e Fa|culty, may not the Ass of <HI>Balaam</HI> &s;erve for their Reproof, as well as he did for that of his Ma&s;ter. Nothing &s;eems to me more unju&s;t, than the Contempt which is offered to this noble ANIMAL by the Vul|gar, who mi&s;take his &s;olemn Maje&s;ty for Dullne&s;s. Should this Epi&s;tle ever appear in Public, as I hope it never will, I am &s;en&s;ible it would be thought an in&s;inuating
<PB N="31" REF="62">
Artifice of mine, to get a Place at Court, or recommend my&s;elf to Somebody in Power; whereas, I have no &s;uch Intention, I a&s;&s;ure you, but &s;hall di&s;intere&s;tedly, and without Flattery, as far as I am able, take away part of the Burden from the Back of this generous Bea&s;t: For, What is heavier than an ill Name? in doing which, I have only imitated the renowned <HI>Osborn's</HI> and <HI>Wal&s;ingham's</HI> of the&s;e our Times, who&s;e Labours I mu&s;t acknowledge to be as far &s;uperior to mine, as they are more diffi|cult: But to proceed; ASSES formerly were not contemptible, their Names were not made a Reproach; they &s;ometimes were cloathed in Furs like our Aldermen, and &s;ometimes in Scarlet, and Cloath of Gold, and King's and Princes u&s;ed to ride upon them. <HI>Midas,</HI> a <HI>Phrygian</HI> Monarch, had him&s;elf the Ears of an Ass, which was in tho&s;e Days, held an uncommon Thing. Kings will not, out of brotherly Affection, de&s;pi&s;e them, moreover this &s;tately Bea&s;t is not to be prevailed upon by Blows; the venerable Di&s;pen&s;ers of our Laws are not endowed with more Gravity; all the Holy-gifted ones, &s;hould re&s;pect him as an Elder, and one of them&s;elves; for he once &s;poke by the &s;ame Divine Power, they would be thought to &s;peak by: Be&s;ides, he has that in him, which is well Worthy of
<PB N="32" REF="63">
their Imitation, I mean his <HI>Patience.</HI> Both Sacred and Profane Hi&s;tory have emble|matized Strength and Heroi&s;m by the Ass, than which, nothing can be more natural, noble, beautiful, or ju&s;t. <HI>Jacob,</HI> when he ble&s;&s;es his Sons, &s;ays, I&s;&s;achar <HI>is a &s;trong</HI> Ass, <HI>crouching down between two Burdens.</HI> And <HI>Homer,</HI> in the Eleventh Book of the <HI>Iliad,</HI> compares <HI>Ajax,</HI> making a noble Retreat, to one of the&s;e <HI>Animals</HI> forcing his Way into a Field of Corn, there &s;atisfying his Hunger, and then retiring with a tardy &s;ullen Intrepidity, Maugre the Oppo&s;ition of a Troop of Boys,
<Q><L>Who&s;e ratt'ling Strokes re&s;ound upon his Sides.</L></Q>
Had I nothing el&s;e to offer in their Behalf, the above-mentioned In&s;tances are &s;ufficient to abate all Ridicule, and draw Re&s;pect from the viperous Tongue of Calumny it&s;elf.</P>
<P>But farther, the mo&s;t eminent Poets, Orators, Hi&s;torians and Naturali&s;ts, have not thought it beneath them to treat of the Ass, either in Metaphor, Simile, or De|&s;cription Narrative. <HI>Pliny Lib.</HI> 11. <HI>Cap.</HI> 37. gives large Account of him, de&s;cribes his Na|ture, Pa&s;&s;ions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and &s;hews us what Judg|ment we are to form of the pricking-up, and what from the limber and half-erected Po&s;ition of his Ears. <HI>Virgil</HI> mentions him but &s;paringly. <HI>Horace</HI> more frequent, the

I &s;hall here re|peat &s;omething truly Poetical, &s;poken of the Ass in our own Language, not inferior to any thing of the Ancients. It is taken from the DUNCIAD, where no le&s;s than a Godde&s;s proclaims &s;everal Sorts of Games, and promi&s;es a Drum to him of all her Favourites, who &s;hall out-voice the Ass.</P>

Scarce do I know whether the Ass is more indebted to the Poet for this excellent De&s;cription of him, or the Poet to the Ass, for tho&s;e Qualifications of his, which were the Occa&s;ion of it: But certain I am, that every Language is enriched with ma|ny ter&s;e Sayings, Proverbs and Sentences, drawn from the known Qualities of this Quadrupede, <HI>fait en dos d'A&s;ne,</HI> &s;ignifies any Thing done with Cunning. <HI>A&s;inus Antro|nius</HI> is a Lob-Cock. <HI>A&s;inus ad Lyram,</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> in the Greek, are Proverbs which &s;eem to reflect upon the Ass for his Unskilfulne&s;s in Mu&s;ic; whereas the con|trary is manife&s;t, for this Animal pays an extraordinary Attention to every &s;ort of Wind-Mu&s;ic, as may be ea&s;ily di&s;cover'd by the pricking-up of his Ears, his &s;impering Ge&s;ture, his frolic Spurning of the Heels, attended by the Clangor of his own Pipe, with a &s;eeming De&s;ire to bear a Part. It is mo&s;t unque&s;tionable, that he has the Ad|vantage of all other Bea&s;ts, the Sounds he utters being more articulate: And many learned Critics agree, that no living Pipe &s;o nearly re&s;embles the Hautboy, Bagpipe, or that more admired new-invented Water-Mu&s;ic, the French-Horn; the Perfor|mers upon which In&s;truments, if he does

<P>Sir <HI>Richard Blackmore</HI> was &s;neered at by the Critics; but what will not Critics &s;neer, for applying the Word <HI>Bray</HI> to the Sound of Armour, War, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which mu&s;t needs have been right in him; for if the Hero him&s;elf is ju&s;tly likened to an Ass, there is, as it were, a Chain of Propriety, in com|paring the Noi&s;e of Arms and Clangor of the Battle, to Braying:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><BIBL>Vide Milton, lib. 6. lin. 209.</BIBL><L>&mdash;Arms on Armour cla&s;hing bray'd,</L>

While I treat of this Subject, methinks I feel &s;ome of that A&s;&s;i&s;tance which the Poets &s;o often call for; I am hurried away, a Flood of Fire pours it&s;elf upon me, Nature is over|power'd violently.

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>I Am got &s;afe to <HI>Hartley-Row,</HI> and in a little better Humour than when I wrote my la&s;t. Our Landlord is a perfect Beau, and mo&s;t exqui&s;itely performs the Honours of his Hou&s;e. I am in pain for his A&s;&s;idui|ty: I cannot fetch a Step, no not to the Window, from the Table, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but he is Squiring me; and &s;o dre&s;&s;ed, and &s;o con|ceited, that nothing but &s;erving a loo&s;e Apprentice&s;hip, could have &s;et him up a Ma&s;ter in the Trade of Foppery. He was a <HI>Gold&s;mith</HI>'s 'Prentice, where he &s;tudied more his Plea&s;ures, than Profit. This Hou&s;e fell to him, and he wi&s;ely re&s;olved to keep it him&s;elf, with the Help of his Si&s;ter, who is a neat, hou&s;ewifely, obliging &s;ort of Woman. I &s;uppo&s;e it is, by much, the be&s;t Entertainment this Road affords. They have a tolerable Cook; and I was glad to find &s;omething I could eat at Three o'Clock, for we came in here at Two, and I can give you a little better Account of my Fellow-Travellers. The <HI>Sir,</HI> I &s;poke
<PB N="47" REF="78">
of, is a Baronet's Son, as he has carefully given me to under&s;tand: I take it for gran|ted, he <HI>likes</HI> me, and would have me do the <HI>&s;ame</HI> by him. As he came in, he put off his Travelling Suit, for a Coat and Ve&s;t, de&s;igned to dazzle the Curate and all his Congregation. The Way I took to morti|fy his Foppery, was, not to &s;peak a Word of the Change; which made him extream unea&s;y: At length, cut of all Patience, he de&s;ired my Opinion, if his Taylor had u&s;ed him well? What the Brocade was worth a Yard? How many Ounces of Silver-Fringe? And recommended to my Curio|&s;ity the exqui&s;ite Workman&s;hip of the Loops; and then gave me the Sum Total of his Co&s;t. I an&s;wered him, That Finery was lo&s;t upon me; I neither was, nor pre|tended to be a Judge. He pertly an&s;wer|ed, He perceived by my Sullenne&s;s, that I had a great deal of Wit; tho' I under&s;tood he had but little by his Remark. Well, all this did not do: He would fain have had me enquired into his Family, Intrigues, and Fortune; which when he perceived I had no Curio&s;ity for, 'Faith Madam, <HI>(&s;ays he)</HI> I beg your Lady&s;hip's Opinion, if I am not the mo&s;t unfortunate Man breathing: I'll tell you a very mortifying Adventure. Nay, you mu&s;t hear me. I vow, this In|differency does not look natural to you;

'Gad, I love a Per&s;on of your Breeding, that know them&s;elves better than to inter|rupt a good Story. Perhaps Madam is not well with her Journey, <HI>an&s;wered Mrs.</HI> May|ore&s;s <HI>of</HI> Totne&s;s. Alas! I wonder Riding in the Coach &s;hould not have got you a better Stomach. Poor Gentlewoman, &s;he has &s;carce eat any thing. I'll recompence that by a Fea&s;t of the Mind, <HI>an&s;wered my Fop.</HI> How &s;ay you, Madam, &s;hall I be|gin the <HI>Regalio?</HI> I had as good con&s;ent, <HI>quoth I:</HI> With or without my Leave, I &s;ee you are re&s;olv'd upon it.

<P>It happened at <HI>Oxford</HI> three Months ago (where I often came, my Father's E&s;tate being not far di&s;tant) I &s;aw a Lady, and fell in Love with her; ay Gad, Madam, down|right in Love with her. She was a Per&s;on genteely bred, and had &s;een the <HI>Beau-Monde,</HI> made the <HI>Tour</HI> of all the Places of Gallan|try, &s;hined in the Drawing-Room, langui&s;h|ed in the Boxes, adorned the Park; in a Word, was all a Man of my Circum&s;tances

could de&s;ire in one he was re&s;olved to make an Oblation of his Heart to. But as her Honour was my Care, and not marrying my De&s;ign, I &s;earched for a dexterous Pre|tence to vi&s;it, and be happy. I took Mr. <HI>Slye</HI> with me, a Gentleman of the Town, who had a Wife: To give you the Character of my Friend, He was naturally amorous, had a hand&s;ome Per&s;on, and Strains of natural Wit beyond whatever I &s;aw in the mo&s;t Acquired; and your Lady&s;hip mu&s;t allow me to be a Judge of Wit, by &s;o dexterou&s;|ly finding out yours, maugre your Silence. I bowed for this extraordinary Compli|ment; and thought I could not more agreeably return it, than by continuing my Silence; and as the Poet has it, <HI>left him to his dear Mi&s;take.</HI> Mr. <HI>Slye,</HI> continued he, was to propo&s;e a Marriage between me and my Lady <HI>Conque&s;t,</HI> to the old People her Relations, whom &s;he was ju&s;t come to live with: But as &s;oon as he &s;aw her, if I was her Fir&s;t <HI>Oxford</HI> Victim, he was certainly the Second; and, as I found, pre&s;ently took with her. She had a very fine Hand, which Mr. <HI>Slye,</HI> according to the Country Liberty, ki&s;&s;ed; and then, with <HI>Cleveland,</HI> &s;aid,
<Q><L>So &s;oft, 'tis Air but once remov'd;</L>
<L>Tender, as 'twere a Jelly Glov'd.</L></Q>
<PB N="50" REF="81">
She gave him a Look, which &s;eemed to &s;ay, &s;he wondered in that Place at &s;uch a Piece of Gallantry; and then pur&s;uing with her Wit the Victory of her Eyes, charm'd my Friend to that Degree, that he told me, he mu&s;t enjoy her, or die. <HI>'Gad, Madam, was not this a very odd Turn? I carried him to &s;peak for me; and he comes to make me the Confidant of his De&s;igns?</HI> We agreed tho', as Friends &s;hould, to keep our mutual Confidence &s;ecret from her, and to endeavour each of us to make him|&s;elf happy, and faithfully to relate the Pro|gre&s;s of our Amours. But becau&s;e the Country is much given to Tatling, the Preten&s;ions of Marriage went on. Lady <HI>Conque&s;t</HI> was Airy and Coquet; loved Com|pany and Gallantry, if they could be pur|cha&s;ed with Safety: But &s;he knew &s;o well how to manage every body, that none dur&s;t &s;peak to her, more than &s;he had a mind to hear. I was one of the awed Fools. <HI>'Gad! would you believe, Madam, that Love could make &s;o great an A&s;s of a Man of my Under|&s;tanding?</HI> And yet it was not altogether that neither, my Pride was concerned; I was re&s;olv'd not to &s;erve for her Diver&s;ion, till I was &s;ure &s;he was con&s;enting to be mine; but could no more keep out of her Company, than I could hang my&s;elf. I de&s;ired her to walk: She con&s;ented, with a

I was jealous, but to no Purpo&s;e; either my Rival's Company, or not my Mi&s;tre&s;s's. <HI>Slye</HI> pretended Fear of his Wife, that he dur&s;t not appear in public with any other Woman; for &s;he already began to have Ap|prehen&s;ions of my Lady <HI>Conque&s;t,</HI> who&s;e Way of Living was remote to tho&s;e of Country-Gentlewomens; and therefore he was re&s;olved to think no more of her; tho' infinitely plea&s;ing to him; for his Fortune depended, in a great mea&s;ure, upon his Wife's Mother. I came back with this doleful News to Lady <HI>Conque&s;t. Go tell him,</HI> an&s;wered &s;he, <HI>he who has pretended to love me, &s;hould fear nothing more than not being beloved; and that I command him to meet us at the appointed Place.</HI> I ran, like a Fool, to do her Me&s;&s;age, which I believed Raillery, becau&s;e &s;he ought to have been more cautious of a married Man's Love, if &s;erious. <HI>Slye</HI> wanted but Intreaty: He con&s;ented, and we met, but not to my Com|fort; tho' the Expence was mine, he had the Profit: She was not ea&s;y unle&s;s he &s;at nigh her; &s;he talked to him, &s;tared at him, did every thing to &s;hew &s;he was plea&s;ed; whil&s;t I, by a Notion of Pride, would pre|tend nothing, for fear I &s;hould not have all: <HI>For 'Gad, Madam, I do not love being baulked thus.</HI> Several Times we met, but all

as little to the Purpo&s;e. Undoubtedly, &s;he &s;aw I loved her, but would not &s;ee, becau&s;e I was of U&s;e in her Affair with <HI>Slye.</HI> The whole Town talked of our approach|ing Wedding, and I began to be Fool enough to re&s;olve on it, thro' <HI>Slye</HI>'s Per&s;ua&s;ion, who continually extolled her Honour and Virtue, and tickled my Pride with the News of her Love; but that &s;he wanted a Declaration from me, before I could ex|pect a Confe&s;&s;ion from her. I told him, I would think on it; and &s;o we parted. That Night (as Chance would have it) I pa&s;&s;ed along by the Hou&s;e where &s;he lived, and I found the Gate open: I know not what Devil of Curio&s;ity carried me in; and when in, to go to her Chamber: I did both un&s;een, and concealed my&s;elf behind the Bed, which I &s;aw &s;itted for Night. I re&s;olved to wait till &s;he &s;hould be in Bed, and then to take Advantage of her Woman's Ab&s;ence, (who lay in the Anti-Chamber) and there to declare my Love, and offer her Marriage. Long I had not waited, <HI>(tho' 'Gad, Madam, I was very im|patient, and thought every Minute Seven)</HI> when the charming Fair came from her Dre&s;&s;ing-Room, with nothing on but her Night-Gown and Slippers, which were &s;oon thrown off, and the Godde&s;s appeared more beauteous than the naked Queen of Love. The happy Bed &s;oon received her;

and &s;he cryed, <HI>Ha&s;te, and bring my Lover to me.</HI> At the&s;e Words her Woman went into the Anti-Chamber, and returned &s;oft|ly with <HI>Slye;</HI> who flew to her Arms, &s;igh|ed, ki&s;&s;ed, and died there.&mdash;<HI>Imagine my Surprize!</HI> 'Twas &s;o great I could not in a long time &s;hew my&s;elf to interrupt 'em: At length, &s;eeing him undre&s;s for Bed, 'Gad, Madam, my Patience was quite ex|pired; <HI>Traytor,</HI> &s;ays I, &s;hewing my&s;elf, <HI>Is it thus thou pre&s;erve&s;t thy feigned Duty to thy Wife?</HI> I laid my Hand upon my Sword, and he did the like on his; and we had certainly drawn, had not the Amorous Fair thrown her&s;elf out of Bed between us, and conjured us on her Knees to make no Noi&s;e, el&s;e &s;he was lo&s;t for ever. I rai&s;ed her naked Beauties, and carried them whence they came, but complained at my hard Fortune, which had made me the In&s;trument of my own Ruin. She &s;aw I was extreamly touched at it, and after her Shame and Surprize was a little over, <HI>You have no Rea&s;on, Sir,</HI> (&s;aid &s;he) <HI>to complain of me: I could have no Engagements with a Man who never pretended to love me. Tho' you have given me the Glory of refu&s;ing you as a Hu&s;band (in the Eyes of the Town) it could not but nettle me, to know there was nothing &s;erious on your Side, but done like a Gentle|man, to &s;ecure my Reputation among&s;t ill-bred</HI>

<HI>Fools, who know not the Charms of Conver|&s;ation, and will not permit it (without Cen|&s;ure) to tho&s;e that do.

<P>I Cannot give my&s;elf any Rea&s;on why the&s;e Coach-men are &s;uch unrea|&s;onable Rogues: They make us ri&s;e at Two in the Morning, to bring us into our Inn at the &s;ame Hour in the After|noon.

He was placed behind me; but I turned my Devotion, and kneeled to him, imagining him no le&s;s than (as in Antique Days) &s;ome

High Prie&s;t of the Sun. The Canon gave me Cau&s;e to think he had dined too well, and was obliged to his Snuff, more than Religion, for keeping him awake. Well, Devotion done, I was forced to break up mine, and leave him without a Knowledge of his Conque&s;t. As we were walking to our Inn, I a&s;ked <HI>Beau</HI> what we &s;hould do to pa&s;s the next Day without being very weary of each other, for <HI>Sunday</HI> does not per|mit Travelling. He (you may be &s;ure) did not fail to tell me, he could never be wea|ry of me, tho' (him&s;elf) expiring by my Sight and Cruelty. I waved his Compli|ment, and told him my De&s;ign of engaging the People in the <HI>Exeter</HI> Coach (if they &s;eemed worth it) to live with us for the Time. When we returned, we were told it was not yet come in, occa&s;ioned by the breaking of the Axle-tree five Miles off; but that a Fellow was gone to mend it, and they were expected every Moment. My Chamber-Window an&s;wered the Court; I ro&s;e to it at the Noi&s;e of the Coach, and pre&s;ently &s;aw alight, a tall, blu&s;tering, big|bon'd, raw Thing, like an over-grown School-Boy, but conceited above any Thing. He had an Appurtenance, called a <HI>Wife,</HI> whom he &s;uffered to get out as well as &s;he could. As long as he had lain by her, he did not think her worth the Civility of his Hand.
<PB N="60" REF="91">
She &s;eemed a Giant of a Woman, but ve|ry fine, with a right Cit's Air. He blu&s;ter|ed pre&s;ently for the be&s;t Lodging, which he &s;aw taken up by her that held the fine Fan before her Face: You may gue&s;s this was your humble Servant. The Cham|berlain told him, it was their Cu&s;tom, fir&s;t come, fir&s;t &s;erved; but that there were very good Chambers be&s;ides. The re&s;t of the Company were <HI>two</HI> Things that looked pert and aukward; Trade&s;mens Daughters I judged them. But methoughts, ca&s;ting my Eyes upon a Gentlewoman and her Servant, that came out la&s;t, I found &s;ome|thing plea&s;ed me; whether it were becau&s;e &s;he really de&s;erved it, or that the Stuff &s;he was with &s;et her off. I had a Ba&s;in of fine Heart-Cherries before me, ju&s;t come from the Garden: I cau&s;ed them to be brought after me into the Gallery, and de&s;igned them as a Bait to the Woman whom I was to begin the Acquaintance with; for <HI>Beau</HI> de&s;igned to &s;et up to get a Fortune in <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> and was unwilling to &s;hew any Irregularity; and I thought my&s;elf above their Reflec|tions.

Lady had much to do to be per&s;uad|ed. As for the other <HI>two,</HI> they were gone to chu&s;e a Lodging. We pre&s;ently grew acquainted, taking Travellers Liberty, and &s;upped together. But, &s;hall I tell you! the Wife grew jealous of me. It &s;eems, her Temper was &s;uch; and her Hu&s;band (no &s;mall Man in his Country, though him|&s;elf ju&s;t &s;et up in Merchandizing at <HI>London;</HI> his Father, one of the Canons at <HI>Exeter:</HI>) thought he might carry all Hearts before him, as well as the Country-La&s;&s;es. They were come from vi&s;iting their Friends, and returning to their Hou&s;e in <HI>London.</HI> Mrs. <HI>Stanhope</HI> (for that was the Lady's Name whom I liked) told me, I was not to count upon the Conque&s;t, for he had given her <HI>Douceurs</HI> all the Way, and made her ex|tream unea&s;y, becau&s;e his Wife appeared to be &s;uch.

They talked of the Town and Country Beauties: At la&s;t, a young Creature was named, whom I had not &s;een; but the Captain &s;et her before every thing he had. I was concerned at his Opinion, and a&s;ked him his of the Duche&s;s of <HI>Grafton?</HI> He gave her due Prai&s;e; but yet in his E&s;teem, this ex|ceeded. I could not but think him ex|treamly in the Wrong; and was angry when I heard him wi&s;h him&s;elf a Man of mighty Fortune, to de&s;erve her. He &s;ailed that Night; and after ten Days Crui&s;e, came in again. His fir&s;t Vi&s;it was to me. I a&s;ked him if he had &s;een his Mi&s;tre&s;s? He &s;aid he had none. I remembred him of what he had &s;poke. He an&s;wered, that I
<PB N="63" REF="94">
had taught him better. He continued his Applications, vi&s;ited me three Times a Day: And becau&s;e I was &s;till jealous of his Words, I had him watched, and an Account brought of all his Vi&s;its. The young La|dy's Uncle made a Ball; but becau&s;e my Brother and he were not well together, there was no Hopes of my being invited; which my Lover very well knew, and therefore &s;aid, he would not be there, ha|ving received Orders to &s;ail. He took his Leave with tran&s;porting Sorrow; and had the Glory to find mine was real. How|ever, I would not lo&s;e the Ball, becau&s;e I de&s;ired to &s;ee my reputed Rival. I for|got to tell you he had never &s;een her but once, when he prai&s;ed her to that Degree; and dexterou&s;ly told me, a &s;econd Sight had undeceived him. I dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf like a Farmer's Wife, with a Ba&s;ket on my Arm; and by the Help of one of the Ser|vants, was placed like a Country Gazer at the Corner of the Room. I needed not to be told my Rival, a thou&s;and dazzling Charms di&s;tingui&s;hed her; and tho' I look|ed with jealous Eyes, mu&s;t acknowledge I never &s;aw any Beauty more perfect. All my Hopes lay in a certain Softne&s;s, which did not promi&s;e much Wit. In a little Time my Traytor (whom I imagined in the wide Ocean) came to the Ball, danced
<PB N="64" REF="95">
with his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and was as a&s;&s;iduous as &s;he de&s;erved. I was &s;o well plea&s;ed at the Di&s;covery, I &s;tayed not for any more, for fear I &s;hould not e&s;cape my&s;elf. About Midnight he came (for a Minute) to &s;ee me, and told me he was ju&s;t come a&s;hore, the Ship under Sail; yet without another Sight, it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to depart. I confounded him with telling him what had &s;o lately pa&s;&s;ed at the Ball: Yet he drew him&s;elf out of the Embarra&s;s, and &s;aid every thing to make me think he loved me; and we were &s;eriou&s;ly treating upon the Affair of Matrimony. I told him he mu&s;t get my Father's Con&s;ent who lived at <HI>London,</HI> where I was going. He begged me to defer my Journey till he came in; which I too readily promi&s;ed; and &s;o we parted. I knew my Fortune fairer than my Rival's, and began to be per&s;uaded I had the better of her. For, what el&s;e could draw him to addre&s;s me? When I &s;aw him return, it was with mutual Joy: But he was ordered that &s;ame Night to &s;ail to <HI>Ply|mouth,</HI> and did not expect to be back in a Week; therefore we agreed upon my Jour|ney. He &s;wore an inviolable Love, and would have contracted him&s;elf, if I dur&s;t, without my Father's Con&s;ent: He intended to write to his Friends above to a&s;k it. And thus we once more parted, but not till he
<PB N="65" REF="96">
had &s;everely exclaimed again&s;t any De&s;igns upon my Rival, before a whole Crew of Town-Go&s;&s;ips, that I was &s;ure would tell her. You may conclude we agreed upon Writing. I took my Journey, and &s;tay|ed at an Aunt's Hou&s;e in <HI>Exeter</HI> Ten Days; where I heard that within Four of my Departure, my Lover returned; and in three more was publickly married to my Rival. I wrote to thank him for ridding me of a knavi&s;h Hu&s;band, wi&s;h|ed him Joy, took Coach, and re&s;olved again&s;t too ea&s;ily believing any Man again.</P>

<P><HI>BEAU</HI> is now grown &s;o <HI>in&s;ipid,</HI> that I &s;hall &s;ay very little of him for the future; and I have Rea&s;on to believe my|&s;elf <HI>&s;uch</HI> to him; for the&s;e two la&s;t Even|ings (contrary to Cu&s;tom) he has not re|dre&s;&s;ed: The Fatigue which he &s;eems more &s;en&s;ible of than any of us, has tarni&s;hed the Lu&s;tre of his Eyes; and in&s;tead of any farther Ogleing, drowns all his amorous Preten&s;ions in as profound Sleep as the un|ea&s;y Jolting of the Coach will permit. This is what I can never be &s;o happy to gain. But to tell you &s;omething of our la&s;t Night's Entertainment: Whil&s;t Supper was getting ready, the Gentleman I told you of, at <HI>Beau</HI>'s Intreaty, gave us an Account of what Affairs were carrying him to <HI>London:</HI> The &s;hort of it is this,</P>
<P>Your Lady&s;hip <HI>(&s;ays he)</HI> may &s;oon per|ceive by my Accent, that I am a Foreigner. I had the Glory of following the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> (now our au&s;picious King) in his
<PB N="69" REF="100">
Expedition into <HI>England.</HI> We landed in the We&s;t, with all tho&s;e Particulars, which are needle&s;s to repeat. During our Stay at <HI>Exeter,</HI> I rendered my con&s;tant Devotion at the Cathedral; and in coming thence one Evening, an old Woman (with a Look as mean as a Beggar) pre&s;ented me a Letter; which when I had opened, I found from an Unknown, who &s;tiled him&s;elf my Friend, and gave me this Advice, that a Lady of good Country-Quality and Fortune (and who was then in <HI>Exeter</HI>) was going to be di&s;po&s;ed of by her Mother to a Man &s;he no way affected: But that &s;he had been heard to &s;ay, <HI>If the hand&s;ome</HI> Switzer <HI>were in his Place, &s;he &s;hould obey without Reluctancy.</HI> And concluded the Letter with giving me Advice, like a good Friend, to improve my growing Fortune; for &s;o con&s;iderable an one as Twelve Thou&s;and Pounds was not every Day thrown into a Soldier's Lap. I had forgot to tell your Lady&s;hip the Letter was writ in <HI>French,</HI> the Lady's Name, and Directions to her Lodgings. My Heart gave me a &s;ecret Pre&s;age that the Matter would not be lucky to me, which I follow|ed, and therefore took no Notice of the Letter. Three Days after, the &s;ame old Woman brought me another, much more pre&s;&s;ing: Upon which I gave my&s;elf blind|ly up to my De&s;tiny. I vi&s;ited, and found
<PB N="70" REF="101">
the Lady, tho' not a Beauty, yet genteel and taking. It was ea&s;y to gue&s;s by my Reception, that the Letters came from her. I will omit the Di&s;cour&s;e we had, and only re&s;t upon Matter of Fact. She obliged me to leave my Command, and go with her to her E&s;tate. Her Mother looked upon me with an evil Eye, but my Mi&s;tre&s;s was tran&s;port|ingly kind, and much concerned that none of the Mini&s;ters round dur&s;t marry us, for fear of the old Lady. Whereupon we con|cluded I &s;hould pretend to take my Leave, as de&s;ingning for <HI>London;</HI> but in&s;tead of that, go directly into <HI>Cornwall,</HI> where &s;he had a con&s;iderable E&s;tate, and would meet me. The Matter happened as we agreed; but for fear her Mother &s;hould pur&s;ue us, &s;he con&s;ented to <HI>take me for her Husband,</HI> before the Par&s;on could be got to make us <HI>&s;uch.</HI> That happy Night I had all the Rea&s;on in the World to believe my&s;elf agreeable to her; and all was confirmed in the Morning by the Prie&s;t. Thus care&s;&s;ed and ble&s;&s;ed, we returned to her Hou&s;e. The old Lady (who had no Command of her Daughter's Fortune, and &s;aw the Bu&s;ine&s;s beyond Re|medy) was one of the fir&s;t to make her Court to me, and wi&s;h me Joy. Three happy Months I had all the Satisfaction that innocent Marriage and exce&s;&s;ive Love in a Bride, could give me. Then I began
<PB N="71" REF="102">
to con&s;ider a little my Affairs, and propo&s;ed to my Wife my being naturalized, that I might look after hers. She &s;wooned at the Name; and when &s;he recovered, &s;he &s;natched a Bayonet of mine, and wounded her&s;elf under the Left Brea&s;t, but not much. I cannot expre&s;s my Surprize: We hu&s;hed the Matter for fear of her Mother; and I employed &s;ome of my Soldiery Skill to cure it, which had the Effect. I enquir|ed into the Rea&s;on of this Extravagancy. She told me the Di&s;covery of <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> in me, when &s;he had believed <HI>Love</HI> was the only Motive of our <HI>Marriage.</HI> Some Days pa&s;|&s;ed, and as often as I offered at it, &s;he re|ceived &s;uch mighty Di&s;gu&s;t, that I re&s;olved to get it done without her Notice; for &s;he took me not as a Hu&s;band, but a Lover. It was true, I was received as a Gue&s;t, but not a Ma&s;ter; and my Circum&s;tance (hav|ing left my Command) required that. I got her Leave for my Journey: She &s;hew|ed &s;uch extravagant Pa&s;&s;ion at our Separa|tion, that I &s;wore a &s;peedy Return; and re&s;olved to leave my Naturalization depend|ing, look after my other Affairs and return within a Fortnight to her: But before that Time I had a dangerous Fit of Sickne&s;s at <HI>London.</HI> I wrote often to her, and gave her an Account that the <HI>Act was pa&s;&s;ed,</HI> and I could now happily call my&s;elf an
<PB N="72" REF="103">
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Husband. She only an&s;wered, She knew how to interpret it; but &s;he was out in her Cunning, if I &s;hould find an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Wife at my Service, who knew not the true Value and U&s;e of one. This Letter damped me; but tru&s;ting to the Greatne&s;s of that Power Love had given me in her Heart, I did not que&s;tion but my Pre&s;ence would make all Things ea&s;y. I took Po&s;t, my Impatience would not &s;tay the Coach, tho' the Remains of my Fever &s;eemed to expect it. I gave my&s;elf no Re&s;t during the whole Journey. I &s;ent to give her No|tice of my Arrival: but what was my Sur|prize, to find all &s;hut at home! I called under her Window where I perceived Light: It was a heavy Night of Rain: I knocked at the Gates, and &s;tormed, but all to no Purpo&s;e; I was glad to take up my Lodging in the Porch. At Six in the Mor|ning an Under-Servant appeared: I a&s;ked for her Lady. She told me &s;he was gone none knew whether, and had conveyed away her Plate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;o that, if I plea&s;ed, an empty Hou&s;e was at my Service. I calmly bore all this, imagining it but a Tryal, &s;ought her round the Country, but in vain; &s;he often &s;hifted Places, and went di&s;gui&s;ed. Not long after, &s;he commenced a <HI>Proce&s;s</HI> again&s;t me, and by a Pretence (which will for ever make her notorious)
<PB N="73" REF="104">
rendered me to the Court as <HI>Incapable.</HI> I was &s;till &s;o tender of her Fame, as to &s;uffer the A&s;per&s;ion. Common Law &s;eparted us: She got the better, by my refu&s;ing to vin|dicate my&s;elf; and I Fifteen Hundred Pounds of her Fortune and the Charges of the Court. It is &s;ince la&s;t <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> that this has happened.

<P>I complimented him upon his Misfor|tunes, and really, in my Opinion, he could not be de&s;erving of them. 'Gad, Madam, (<HI>&s;ays</HI> Beau) &s;ee what incon&s;tant Things you Ladies are!

<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>My Conqueror (whom I adored for being &s;o) is gone; and my Cloy&s;ter is now as much a Pri&s;on to me, as it was Heaven, and Liber|ty, and all Things, when I had him there. It was an unworthy Thing to &s;teal my better Part, my Soul, away, and not think this little Frame, its old Companion, worth taking with you. But what you had got, you thought was of light Carriage, needed little Stowage, paid no Freight, and (I dare &s;take my Life) was the All you ever intended to have of me: And to be &s;o &s;erved, is (it &s;eems) the All I am ever likely to expect from you. How gro&s;ly did I flatter my&s;elf, and abu&s;e you,</HI>
<PB N="82" REF="113">
<HI>whenever I imagined you would be kind and true to me! You that are &s;o cruel, that could you reduce any other Woman into my ill Cir|cum&s;tances, if there was a Third in the World, you would certainly leave the former, and there feign fre&s;h Adorations. If there was not, yet purely to gratify your Inhumanity to her, even I, now &s;lighted and neglected, &s;hould then have your Company; for you could not brook being put by a Plea&s;ure of that Kind, though it co&s;t you the Trouble of going to one who loved you more than the World.</HI></Q></P>
<P>How very odd (and as tho' you were writing to &s;ome public Place of Intelligence) was that <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> of yours in your la&s;t Letter! <HI>concerning the great Lightning and Thunder which you &s;ay happened in your Parts!</HI> Al&s;o, <HI>you de&s;ire to know what Wea|ther we have had here.</HI> Are the&s;e proper Enquiries for a Love-Letter? Truly it might have <HI>Thundered, Lightened,</HI> and <HI>Rained,</HI> or it might have been very <HI>plea|&s;ant delightful Weather</HI> for aught I know; for I am not capable of making any Re|marks of that kind: But this I can inform you, being too &s;ure of the Truth of it, that it has been very <HI>&s;tormy Weather</HI> in my <HI>Eyes</HI> ever &s;ince your Departure; and until you return (the only <HI>Sun,</HI> who&s;e Influence

can di&s;per&s;e the&s;e <HI>Clouds</HI>) I fear it will ever be <HI>Tempe&s;tuous.</HI> This Account (it may be) plea&s;es you more than if I had &s;ent you Word the ill <HI>Weather</HI> had reached our Country, demoli&s;hed our Mona&s;tery, &s;et me at Liberty, and I was in Pur&s;uit of you. Then, then, how I would glut my Revenge by the Incur&s;ions of my Love! For it &s;hould hunt you in all Places and all Countries. And &s;ince it wore &s;o much the Vi&s;age of an evil Spirit in your Con|ceit here, as to make you quit the Spot, I would try whether Change of Air would alter its Complection and Features, &s;o as to force you into a better Opinion of it, and be thoroughly revenged on you that Way: For <HI>to love,</HI> I find is the Unhappine&s;s you would avoid above all other things: But your Appetite and Ta&s;te is as much depraved as my Project is vain and imprac|ticable: I find the Sour of <HI>France</HI> gratifies your Palate above the Sweets of <HI>Portugal;</HI> and a <HI>French</HI> LADY (with her di&s;tant Re|gards to your Addre&s;s, and, at la&s;t, coun|terfeit artificial Acceptance) &s;hall engage you much more than the Loyalty, Integri|ty, Truth and Freedom of my unlimited Pa&s;&s;ion. Will not the World &s;wear we are both mad? You for preferring a Counter|feit, (becau&s;e it gli&s;ters, before the true Metal it&s;elf, which is known to every

Child by its Weight:) I for my Fidelity to &s;o much Ingratitude. But let the World blame us as it plea&s;es, I am re&s;olved to be as true to you, as you to your natural In|con&s;tancy. To what a Degree of Bli&s;s &s;hould I be advanced, if I could find you complaining of the Remi&s;&s;ne&s;s of my Love, and admiring the Inten&s;ene&s;s of your own: Then I &s;hould be but too happy if that Fault was not found on your Side, as alas! to all the World too vi&s;ibly it is: And the &s;ame Conceptions you make of an Immen|&s;ity, will but ju&s;t &s;erve you to fathom my Zeal, which (although cheri&s;hed and pru|ned after the mo&s;t careful Manner) is pro|ductive of nothing but the mo&s;t bitter, &s;our, and unplea&s;ant Fruits imaginable.&mdash;Your unkind Dealings and Actions to me, are the Fruits of my extraordinary Pa&s;&s;ion. What Soul could imagine &s;uch di&s;&s;onant Notes &s;hould &s;trike, to interrupt the Har|mony of my Affection? In what had you been the wor&s;e, had you retaliated my ex|tream Kindne&s;s with but a little of yours; and although more than a little be my Due, yet with the lea&s;t Grain I could have wrought my own Contentment: But you are &s;o unju&s;t to deny all, and leave me to a racking and a mi&s;erable De&s;pair; one Hour's Torment of which, I would not wi&s;h you &s;hould endure Ages to come, to

be &s;et free my&s;elf; and yet no otherwi&s;e fond of my Condition, but as it is a Gift of yours, and which (for any Thing le&s;s than your Love) I will never part with. O! barbarous, barbarous Man! to deny me that which you take more Pains to throw away upon another, than I can do to ob|tain it. You &s;hall not u&s;e me thus; indeed you mu&s;t not: It is I &s;ay it, but you re|gard not that, &s;o in&s;en&s;ible are you of my Condition; which though never &s;o unfor|tunate as to my own particular, yet is ag|gravated with Cares for your Welfare, who are the &s;ole Cau&s;e of my Unhappine&s;s. How you will reli&s;h this <HI>Letter</HI> I know not; I fear you will think there are too many Invectives again&s;t your Tyranny; in which I will agree with you my&s;elf, and a&s;k your Forgivene&s;s: But alas! they are as gentle as I could po&s;&s;ibly per&s;uade my Pen to drop; for &s;ince you take &s;o much Plea&s;ure in a hard Heart, I would not for the World any ways cro&s;s you, by making you le&s;s ob|durate; &s;o tenderly I value your Satisfac|tion, and &s;o little (for your &s;ake) my own. But oh! the infinite Plea&s;ures you would find in <HI>Love,</HI> if you thought them worth the looking after! <HI>Love</HI> (as it is, or is not mutual) is the true&s;t Epitome of the &s;uper|natural States: If mutual, the Joys are la|&s;ting, and never cloy; if not, the Tor|ments
<PB N="86" REF="117">
are intolerable, yet mu&s;t be endur|ed. Oh! that any thing I could &s;ay might di&s;&s;olve you to a Sen&s;e of my mi&s;erable Life; or, indeed rather your own! And yet if it could in the lea&s;t enter into my Thoughts, that you are altogether at Repo&s;e, I a&s;&s;ure you, I would never interrupt you; no Noi&s;e of my Afflictions &s;hould ever be your Di&s;tur|bance: But I am very much mi&s;taken, if you are altogether without Remor&s;e for the Sufferings you have brought upon me. I remember you once was flexible, and of a compa&s;&s;ionate Nature, and your Behaviour very like a Gentleman; whatever has mi&s;|guided you to the Abu&s;e of my Favours, which (if I have Knowledge of my Heart) were at fir&s;t, much more for your &s;ake than my own, you were the Aggre&s;&s;or, and not I; and whatever Kindne&s;s I &s;hewed you, was more to make me happy, than your|&s;elf; that by Charity to a Serpent, I at la&s;t was &s;tung. It is &s;aid that venomous Crea|tures have a bal&s;amick Quality in them|&s;elves, to cure the Wounds they make: But you (more unnatural than all the re&s;t) have none; at lea&s;t, mo&s;t cruelly you with|hold it from me. Oh Heaven! that I had but Power to contain my&s;elf! that I had but Temper to be a little calm! But it is a Condition I have long &s;ince abandoned, and (till I &s;ee you again) will never re-a&s;|&s;ume.
<PB N="87" REF="118">
In the Rage I am in, I could think in you as many Unkindne&s;&s;es, as by and by the Fury of Love would find a Ta&s;k to un|ravel; for if one Half Hour I blame you, in the next I call it Inju&s;tice. So careful am I, that no ill Thought of you appear de&s;erving, that were you wor&s;e than you are, my Plea&s;ure would con&s;i&s;t in being flattered that you are better than I think you: Nay, &s;ometimes I per&s;uade my&s;elf that you are a Man of the greate&s;t Ju&s;tice in the World; and that it is not even in your Nature (wilfully) to do an unequal Thing. But it is mo&s;t certain, I am doom|ed to a fruitle&s;s Love, without the lea&s;t Po&s;&s;ibility of a Deliverance. Indeed, for|merly I had a faint Pro&s;pect (as I thought) of being in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;tored; but I looked through fal&s;e Opticks, that pre&s;ent|ed me with a wrong Object; and &s;ince that, I have done the great Work, of lear|ning to be well &s;atisfied with my intolera|ble Condition. Did my Love run parallel with what is commonly found in the World, it would not be &s;o de&s;perate.&mdash;Happy they, who (in a Pet, or upon &s;ome &s;mall Di&s;gu&s;t) can recede from their Pa&s;|&s;ions, and &s;et up for new Ones el&s;ewhere; and whatever they pretend, Self-Intere&s;t is the greate&s;t Thing. This is the Way of Amouring mo&s;t in Fa&s;hion: This is that
<PB N="88" REF="119">
Impo&s;ture which prevails upon &s;o many tender Hearts: And in Ca&s;es of Denial, very artificially can u&s;urp langui&s;hing Eyes, want no expre&s;&s;ive In&s;inuations, counter|feit Melancholy and Di&s;traction; and all to &s;erve &s;ome ba&s;e Bye-End. If this had been the Quality of my Love, the Ven|geance you a&s;&s;ign me had then been me|rited. I verily believe, if it had had but the lea&s;t Tincture of Treachery, I &s;hould have won your Heart, &s;hould have made you jealous: And that Temper would have been very incon&s;i&s;tent with your Re&s;olu|tions to make a thorough Conque&s;t: No|thing le&s;s than which (to a Man of Prowe&s;s like you) could have been a real Plea&s;ure. Yes, yes; it is very plain, if my Pa&s;&s;ion had been forged, and bore a fal&s;e Accent, it would certainly much better have agreed with yours, as being much nearer related; but the fatal Con&s;equence (of a true Fer|vency, returned with fair A&s;&s;urances, and foul Actions) none knows but the wretch|ed, &s;olitary I. Upon the whole, I think verily I love you, becau&s;e you make me mi&s;erable. If that be true, go on, be &s;ig|nalized to the World for your Unkindne&s;s, that the more I may be &s;o, for my unac|countable Affection. That I love you, Heaven knows; you know el&s;e I &s;hould &s;ee you here again, cringing out the feigned
<PB N="89" REF="120">
Allegations of your Sincerity, though much more di&s;tant than we are. O, that we were to begin again! What Cour&s;e would I then take! I fear, even fool my&s;elf, as I have done; for &s;ince I know no greater Plea&s;ure than the Love of you, I &s;hould too willingly run the Ri&s;que of any Di&s;ad|vantage that could happen by it. I die a thou&s;and Deaths every Hour, and &s;till re|vive, to die them over again: Adieu. What could I not endure for your &s;ake? I have at this Moment &s;o lively an <HI>Idea</HI> of you, that I almo&s;t fancy you here in Per&s;on. Methinks, how very kind you are! How affectionately you condole me for the Tor|ments I have &s;uffered in your Ab&s;ence; and how thankful I am to you for them! How you pre&s;s my Hand, and &s;wear you will never part with me! And Ah, <HI>Mon&s;ieur!</HI> How I believe you, for being hitherto &s;o faithful!&mdash;Once more Adieu. I think I never writ Letters to you in my Life, but their Length made them &s;tayed for. The Po&s;t (at my Reque&s;t) has waited a great while, and I am now &s;ent to; I wonder el&s;e, when I &s;hould give over. You may judge a little of my Condition, when you &s;ee even hurrying-Po&s;t-ha&s;te it&s;elf can ad|mit of a Delay to plea&s;e me. The Actions of all People that &s;ee me, are de&s;ignedly kind, and of a De&s;ire to divert me. One takes

me by the Hand, begging of me to be chearful, and leave my unprofitable Think|ing; &s;hewing me good Rea&s;on for it: But, alas! I find <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> two very &s;e|parate Things, not at all influencing each other.

<OPENER><DATELINE>Mar near Donca&s;ter, <DATE>Oct. 6. 1688.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_YOUR having no Pro&s;pect of ob|taining a Commi&s;&s;ion for me, can no way alter or cool my De&s;ire at this important Junc|ture, to venture my Life in &s;ome Manner or other, for my King and my Country.</P>
<P>I cannot bear living under the Reproach of lying ob&s;cure and idle in a Country Re|tirement,
<PB N="92" REF="124">
when every Man, who has the lea&s;t Sen&s;e of Honour, &s;hould be preparing for the Field.</P>
<P>You may remember, Sir, with what Reluctance I &s;ubmitted to your Commands upon <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s Rebellion, when no Im|portunity could prevail with you to permit me to leave the Academy; I was too young to be hazarded; but give me Leave to &s;ay, it is glorious at any Age to die for one's Country, and the &s;ooner, the nobler the Sacrifice.</P>
<P>I am now older by three Years; my Uncle <HI>Bathe</HI> was not &s;o old, when he was left among the Slain at the Battle of <HI>Newbury:</HI> Nor you your&s;elf, Sir, when you make your E&s;cape from your Tu|tors, to join your Brother at the Defence of <HI>Scilly.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame Cau&s;e is now come round about again: The King has been mi&s;-led; let tho&s;e who have mi&s;-led him be an&s;wer|able for it: Nobody can deny, but he is Sacred in his own Per&s;on, and it is every hone&s;t Man's Duty to defend it.</P>
<P>You are pleas'd to &s;ay, it is yet doubt|ful, if the <HI>Hollanders</HI> are ra&s;h enough to make &s;uch an Attempt: But be that as it will, I beg Leave to in&s;i&s;t upon it, that I may be pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty, as one, who&s;e utmo&s;t Ambition it is to de|vote
<PB N="93" REF="125">
his Life to his Service, and my Coun|try's, after the Example of all my An|ce&s;tors.</P>
<P>The Gentry a&s;&s;embled at <HI>York,</HI> to agree upon the Choice of Repre&s;entatives for the County, have prepared an Addre&s;s, to a&s;|&s;ure his Maje&s;ty, they are ready to &s;acrifice their Lives and Fortunes for him, upon this, and all other Occa&s;ions; but at the &s;ame Time, they humbly be&s;eech him to give them &s;uch Magi&s;trates, as may be agreeable to the Laws of the Land; for at pre&s;ent, there is no Authority to which they can legally &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>They have been beating for Volunteers at <HI>York,</HI> and the Towns adjacent, to &s;up|ply the Regiments at <HI>Hull,</HI> but nobody will li&s;t.</P>
<P>By what I can hear, every body wi&s;hes well to the King, but they would be glad, his Mini&s;ters were hang'd.</P>
<P>The Winds continue &s;o contrary, that no Landing can be &s;o &s;oon as was ap|prehended; therefore, I may hope, with your Leave and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to be in Rea|dine&s;s before any Action can begin.</P>
<P>I be&s;eech you, Sir, mo&s;t humbly and mo&s;t earne&s;tly, to add this one Act of In|dulgence more to &s;o many other Te&s;ti|monies, which I have con&s;tantly received

<OPENER><DATELINE>At the Camp in Flanders, <DATE>Sept. 4. 1711.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My Dear Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHILST you are pur&s;uing Ho|nour in the Field, in the earlie&s;t Time of your Life, after the Example of your Ance&s;tors, I am commanded by the Queen, to let you know, &s;he has declared you her Lord-Lieutenant of the County of <HI>Cornwall;</HI> the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> to act for you till you are of Age.</P>
<P>You will do well to write your mo&s;t humble Thanks to her Maje&s;ty, for &s;o gra|ciou&s;ly remembring you, un&s;ollicited, in your Ab&s;ence: You &s;hould likewi&s;e do the &s;ame to my Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> for accepting the Trouble.</P>
<P>This, my dear Lord, is a Preparative to bring you upon the Stage with &s;ome Lu&s;tre at your fir&s;t Appearance in the World. You
<PB N="96" REF="128">
are placed at the Head of a Body of Gen|try, entirely di&s;pos'd in Affection to you, and your Family: You are born po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of all tho&s;e amiable Qualities, which cannot fail of fixing their Hearts: You have no other Example to follow, but to tread in the Steps of your Ance&s;tors: It is all that is hoped or de&s;ired from you.</P>
<P>You are upon an uncommon Foundation in that Part of the World: Your Ance&s;tors, for at lea&s;t five hundred Years, never made any Al|liance, Male or Female, out of the <HI>We&s;tern</HI> Counties: Thus there is hardly a Gentle|man, either in <HI>Cornwall</HI> or <HI>Devon,</HI> but has &s;ome of your Blood, or you &s;ome of theirs. I remember, the fir&s;t Time I accompany'd your Grandfather into the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> upon hold|ing his Parliament of <HI>Tinners,</HI> as Warden of the <HI>Stannaries,</HI> when there was the mo&s;t numerous Appearance of Gentry of both Counties, that had ever been re|member'd together; I ob&s;erv'd there was hardly any one but whom he call'd <HI>Cou&s;in;</HI> and I could not but ob&s;erve, at the &s;ame Time, how well they were plea&s;ed with it. Let this be a Le&s;&s;on for you, when it comes to your Turn to appear among&s;t them. Nothing is more obliging, than to &s;eem to retain the Memory of Kindred and Allian|ces, tho' never &s;o remote: And by Con&s;e|quence, nothing more di&s;obliging, than a
<PB N="97" REF="129">
Forgetfulne&s;s of them; which is always imputed to an affected, di&s;dainful Superio|rity and Pride.</P>
<P>There is another Particular, in my Opi|nion, of no &s;mall Con&s;equence to the Sup|port of your Intere&s;t, which I would re|commend to your Imitation; and that is, to make <HI>Stowe</HI> your principal Re&s;idence. I have heard your Grandfather &s;ay, if ever he liv'd to be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of <HI>New-Hall,</HI> he would pull it down, that your Father might have no Temptation to withdraw from the ancient Seat of his Family. From the <HI>Conque&s;t</HI> to the <HI>Re&s;tauration,</HI> your An|ce&s;tors con&s;tantly re&s;ided among&s;t their Countrymen, except when the public Ser|vice call'd upon them to &s;acrifice their Lives for it.</P>
<P><HI>Stowe</HI> in my Grandfather's Time, till the Civil Wars broke out, was a Kind of Academy for all the young Men of Family in the Country: He provided him&s;elf with the be&s;t Ma&s;ters of all Kinds for Educa|tion; and the Children of his Neighbours and Friends &s;hared the Advantage with his own. Thus he, in a Manner, became the Father of his Country; and not only en|gaged the Affection of the pre&s;ent Genera|tion, but laid a Foundation of Friend&s;hip for Po&s;terity, which is not worn out at this Day.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="130">
Upon this Foundation, my Lord, you in|herit Friends without the Trouble of make|ing them, and have only to pre&s;erve them: an ea&s;y Ta&s;k for you, to whom Nature has been &s;o liberal of every Quality ne|ce&s;&s;ary to attract Affection, and gain the Heart!</P>
<P>I mu&s;t tell you, the Generality of our Countrymen have been always <HI>Royali&s;ts;</HI> you inherit too much Loyal Blood to like them the wor&s;e. There is an old Saying among&s;t them, That a <HI>Godolphin</HI> was never known to want Wit; a <HI>Trelawney,</HI> Courage; or a <HI>Granville,</HI> Loyalty. Wit and Courage are not to be mi&s;taken; and to give tho&s;e Fa|milies their Due, they &s;till keep up to their Character: But it is the Misfortune of Loyalty, not to be &s;o clearly under&s;tood or defined. In a Country, &s;ubject to Revolu|tions, what pa&s;&s;es for Loyalty To-day, may be Trea&s;on To-morrow; but I make great Difference between Real and Nomi|nal Trea&s;on. In the Quarrel of the Hou&s;es of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> both Sides were pro|claimed Traitors, as the other prevailed: Even under <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s U&s;urpation, all who adhered to the King were proclaimed Traitors, and &s;uffered as &s;uch; but this makes no Alteration in the Thing it&s;elf: It may be enacted Trea&s;on to call black, black; or white, white: But black will
<PB N="99" REF="131">
be black, and white will be white, in Spite of all the Legi&s;lators in the World.</P>
<P>There can be no Doubt about Allegi|ance, unle&s;s Princes become Tyrants, and then they cea&s;e to be Kings: They will no longer be re&s;pected as God's Vicegerents, who violate the Laws they were &s;worn to protect. The Preacher may tell us of pa&s;|&s;ive Obedience; that Tyrants are to be pa|tiently &s;uffer'd, as Scourges in the Hands of a righteous God, to cha&s;ti&s;e a &s;inful Na|tion; and to be &s;ubmitted to, like Plagues, Famines, and &s;uch like Judgments from above. Such Doctrine, were it true, could only &s;erve to mi&s;lead ill-judging Princes in|to a fal&s;e Security; Men are not to be rea|&s;on'd out of their Sen&s;es: Human Nature, and Self-Pre&s;ervation, will eternally arm again&s;t Slavery and Oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is therefore not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that even the weake&s;t Prince would run that Hazard, unle&s;s &s;educed by Advice, wicked|ly palliated by evil Coun&s;ellors. <HI>Nero</HI> him&s;elf, under the Influence of a good Mi|ni&s;try, was the milde&s;t, the mo&s;t gracious, and be&s;t beloved of the Emperors: The mo&s;t &s;anguinary, the mo&s;t profligate, and the mo&s;t abhorr'd under a bad one. A Prince may be deceiv'd, or mi&s;taken in the Choice of his Favourites; but he has this

<P>EVery living Creature, my dear Lord, is entitled to Offices of Humanity: The Di&s;tre&s;s, even of an Enemy, &s;hould reconcile us to him: If he thir&s;ts, give him Drink; if he hungers, give him Food; overcome Evil with Good. It is with this Di&s;po&s;ition I would have you enter into the Exerci&s;e of that Authority, [<HI>Lord-Lieute|nant of</HI> Cornwall] with which her Maje&s;ty has honoured you over your Countrymen. Let no body in&s;pire you with Party-Preju|dices and Re&s;entments. Let it be your Bu&s;ine&s;s to reconcile Differences, and heal Divi&s;ions; and to re&s;tore, if po&s;&s;ible, Har|mony and good Neighbourhood among&s;t them: If then there &s;hould be any left to wi&s;h you ill, make them a&s;ham'd and confounded with your Goodne&s;s and Mo|deration:
<PB N="103" REF="135">
Not that I would ever advi&s;e you to &s;acrifice one Hair of the Head of an old Friend to your Family, to gain fifty new ones; but if you can encrea&s;e the Number by Curte&s;y and Moderation, it may be worth the Trial.</P>
<P>Believe me, my dear Lord, Humanity and Genero&s;ity make the be&s;t Foundation to build a Character upon: A Man may have Birth, and Riches, and Power, Wit, Learning, Courage; but without Genero|&s;ity it is impo&s;&s;ible to be a great Man: Whatever the Rich and Powerful may think of them&s;elves, whatever Value they may &s;et upon their Abundance and Gran|deur, they will find them&s;elves but the more hated and de&s;pis'd for the ill U&s;e they make of it.</P>
<P>You &s;hould look upon your&s;elves but as Stewards and Tru&s;tees for the Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed: Your Over-abundance is but a Depo&s;it for the U&s;e and Relief of the Unhappy; you are an&s;werable for all Superfluities mi&s;pent: It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that Providence would have made &s;uch Di&s;tinctions among Men, &s;uch unequal Di&s;tributions, but that they might endear them&s;elves to one ano|ther by mutual Helps and Obligations. <HI>Gra|titude</HI> is the &s;ure&s;t Cement of Love, Friend|&s;hip, and Society.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="136">
There are, indeed, Rules to be ob&s;erv'd, and Mea&s;ures to be kept, in the Di&s;tribu|tion of Favours. We know who have both the Power and Inclination to do Good, but for Want of Judgment in the Direction, they pa&s;s only for good-natur'd Fools in|&s;tead of generous Benefactors.</P>
<P>My Lord&mdash;will grudge a Guinea to an hone&s;t Gentleman in Di&s;tre&s;s, but rea|dily give twenty to a common Strumper. Another &s;hall re&s;u&s;e to lend fifty Pounds to his be&s;t Friend without &s;ufficient Security, and the next Moment &s;et his whole Fortune upon a Card or a Die; a Chance, for which he can have no Security. My Lord&mdash;is to be &s;een every Day at a Toy-Shop, &s;quandring away his Money in Trinkets and Baubles; and at the &s;ame Time leaves his Brothers and Si&s;ters without common Nece&s;&s;aries.</P>
<P>Genero&s;ity does not con&s;i&s;t in a Con|tempt of Money, in throwing it away at Random, without Judgment or Di&s;tinction; tho' that indeed is better than locking it up, for Multitudes have the Benefit of it; but in a right Di&s;po&s;ition to proper Objects, in Proportion to the Merit, the Circum&s;tan|ces, the Rank, and Condition of tho&s;e, who &s;tand in Need of our Service.</P>
<P>Princes are more expo&s;ed than any others to the mi&s;placing their Favours: Merit is

ever mode&s;t, and keeps its Di&s;tance: The Forward and Importunate &s;tand always neare&s;t in Sight, and are not to be put out of Countenance, nor thru&s;t out of the Way.</P>
<P>I remember to have heard a Saying of the late King <HI>James, That be never knew a mo|de&s;t Man make his Way in a Court. David Floyd,</HI> whom you know, being then in wait|ing at his Maje&s;ty's Elbow, reply'd blunt|ly, <HI>Pray, Sir, who&s;e Fault's that?</HI> The King &s;tood corrected, and was &s;ilent. If Princes could &s;ee with their own Eyes, and hear with their own Ears, what a happy Situation it would be both for them&s;elves and their Subjects? To reward Merit, to re|dre&s;s the Injured, to relieve the Oppre&s;&s;ed, to rai&s;e the Mode&s;t, to humble the In&s;olent; what a God-like Prerogative, were a right U&s;e made of it!</P>
<P>How happy are you, my dear Lord, who are born with &s;uch generous Inclinations, with Judgment to direct them, and the Means to indulge them! Of all Men mo&s;t mi&s;erable is he, who has the Inclination, without the Means. To meet with a de|&s;erving Object of Compa&s;&s;ion, without hav|ing the Power to give Relief, of all the Cir|cum&s;tances in Life is the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable: To have the Power is the greate&s;t Plea|&s;ure.</P>

<P>WHEN I look upon the Date of your la&s;t Letter, I mu&s;t own my&s;elf blameable for not having &s;ooner return'd you my Thanks for it.</P>
<P>I approve very well of your Re&s;olution of dedicating your&s;elf to the Service of God; you could not chu&s;e a better Ma&s;ter, pro|vided you have &s;o &s;ufficiently &s;earch'd your Heart as to be per&s;uaded you can &s;erve him well: In &s;o doing you may &s;ecure to your|&s;elf many Ble&s;&s;ings in this World, as well as a &s;ure Expectation in the next. There is one thing which I perceive you have not thoroughly purg'd your&s;elf from, which is Flattery: You have be&s;tow'd &s;o much of that upon me in your Letter, that I hope you have no more left, and that you meant it only to take your Leave of &s;uch Flights of Fancy, which, however well meant, oftener put a Man out of Countenance than oblige him.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="140">
You are now become a Searcher after Truth: I &s;hall hereafter take it more kind|ly to be ju&s;tly reprov'd by you, than to be unde&s;ervedly complimented.</P>
<P>I would not have you under&s;tand me, as if I recommended to you a &s;our Pre&s;byte|rian Severity; that is yet more to be avoid|ed. Advice, like Phy&s;ick, &s;hould be &s;o &s;weeten'd and prepar'd, as to be made pala|table, or Nature may be apt to revolt again&s;t it. Be always &s;incere, but at the &s;ame Time always polite: Be humble without de&s;cending from your Character; reprove and correct without offending good Manners: To be a Cynick is as bad as to be a Sycophant: You are not to lay a&s;ide the Gentleman with your Sword, nor to put on the Gown to hide your Birth and good Breeding, but to adorn it. Such has been the Malice of the World, from the Beginning, that Pride, Avarice, and Am|bition, have been charg'd upon the Prie&s;t|hood in all Ages, in all Countries, and in all Religions. What they are mo&s;t oblig'd to combat again&s;t in their Pulpits, they are mo&s;t accus'd of encouraging in their Con|duct. It behoves you therefore to be more upon your Guard in this, than in any other Profe&s;&s;ion: Let your Example confirm your Doctrine; and let no Man ever have it in
<PB N="109" REF="141">
his Power to reproach you with practi&s;ing contrary to what you preach.</P>
<P>You had an Uncle, Dr. <HI>Dennis Granville,</HI> Dean of <HI>Durham,</HI> who&s;e Memory I &s;hall ever revere; make him your Example: Sanctity &s;ate &s;o ea&s;y, &s;o unaffected, and &s;o graceful upon him, that in him we beheld the very Beauty of Holine&s;s: He was as chearful, as familiar, and conde&s;cending in his Conver&s;ation, as he was &s;trict, regular and exemplary in his Piety: As well bred and accompli&s;h'd as a Courtier, as reverend and venerable as an Apo&s;tle: He was indeed in every Thing apo&s;tolical, for he abandon'd all to follow his Lord and Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>May you re&s;emble him; may he revive in you; may his Spirit de&s;cend upon you, as <HI>Elijah</HI>'s upon <HI>Eli&s;ha;</HI> and may the great God of Heaven, in guiding, directing, and &s;trengthening your pious Re&s;olutions, pour down his be&s;t and choice&s;t Ble&s;&s;ings upon you.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Peru&s;al of this DIA|LOGUE, in DEFENCE of the FAIR SEX, written by a GENTLEMAN of my Ac|quaintance, much &s;urprized me: For it was not ea&s;y for me to ima|gine, that one &s;o young, could have treated &s;o nice a Subject with &s;o much Judgment. It is true, I was not ignorant that he was naturally ingenious, and that he had improved him&s;elf by Travelling; and from thence I might rea&s;onably have ex|pected
<PB N="116" REF="146">
that Air of Gallantry, which is &s;o vi&s;ibly diffu&s;ed thro' the Body of the Work, and is indeed the Soul that animates all Things of this Na|ture: But &s;o much Variety of Read|ing, both in ancient and modern Authors, &s;uch Dige&s;tion of that Read|ing, &s;o much Ju&s;tne&s;s of Thought, that it leaves no Room for Affecta|tion, or Pedantry, I may venture to &s;ay, are not overcommon among&s;t practi&s;ed Writers, and very rarely to be found among&s;t Beginners. It puts me in Mind of what was &s;aid of Mr. <HI>Waller,</HI> the Father of our <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Numbers, upon the Sight of his fir&s;t Ver&s;es, by the Wits of the la&s;t Age, that <HI>he came out into the World Forty Thou&s;and &s;trong, before they had heard of him.</HI> Here, in Imita|tion of my Friend's Apo&s;trophes, I hope the Reader need not be told, that Mr. <HI>Waller</HI> is only mentioned for Honour's &s;ake, that I am de&s;irous
<PB N="117" REF="147">
of laying hold on his Memory, on all Occa&s;ions, and thereby acknow|ledging to the World, that unle&s;s he <HI>had</HI> written, none of us <HI>could</HI> write. I know my Friend will forgive me this Digre&s;&s;ion; for it is not only a Copy of his Stile, but of his Can|dour. The Reader will ob&s;erve, that he is ready for all Hints of com|mending Merit, and the Writers of this Age and Country are particular|ly obliged to him, for his pointing out tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages which the <HI>French</HI> call <HI>Beaux Endroits,</HI> wherein they have mo&s;t excelled. And tho' I may &s;eem in this, to have my own Intere&s;t in View, becau&s;e he has more than once mentioned me, &s;o much to my Advantage, yet I hope the Reader will take it only for a <HI>Parenthe&s;is,</HI> becau&s;e the Piece would have been very perfect without it. I may be &s;uffered to plea&s;e my&s;elf with the Kindne&s;s of my Friend,

without valuing my&s;elf upon his Partiality: He had not Confidence enough to &s;end it out into the World, without my Opinion of it, that it might pa&s;s &s;ecurely, at lea&s;t among&s;t the fair Readers, for who&s;e Service it was principally de&s;igned. I am not &s;o pre&s;uming, to think my Opi|nion can either be his Touch&s;tone, or his Pa&s;&s;port: But I thought I might &s;end him back to <HI>Ario&s;to;</HI> who has made it the Bu&s;ine&s;s of al|mo&s;t Thirty <HI>Stanzas</HI> in the Begin|ning of the 37th Book of his <HI>Orlan|do Furio&s;o,</HI> not only to prai&s;e that beautiful part of the Creation, but al&s;o to make a &s;harp Satire on their Enemies; to give Mankind their own, and to tell them plainly, that from their Envy it proceeds that the Vir|tue and great Actions of Women are purpo&s;ely concealed, and the Fail|ings of &s;ome few among&s;t them ex|po&s;ed with all the aggravating Cir|cum&s;tances

For my own Part, who have always been their Servant, and have never drawn my Pen again&s;t them, I had rather &s;ee &s;ome of them prai&s;ed extraordinarily, than any of them &s;uffer by Detrac|tion: And that in this Age, and at this Time particularly, wherein I find more <HI>Heroines</HI> than <HI>Heroes.</HI> Let me therefore give them Joy of their new Champion: If any will think me more partial to him than really I am, they can only &s;ay I have returned his Bribe: And the wor&s;t I wi&s;h him, is, that he may receive <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> from the <HI>Men,</HI> and <HI>Favour</HI> only from the <HI>Ladies.</HI></P>

<P>_IT is a dangerous thing, MADAM, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, this Con|ver&s;ing with fair Ladies; and it draws us into Inconveniencies, of which we do not at fir&s;t &s;ee the Con&s;equences. I little thought, when I talked with your Lady&s;hip, of the Vir|tues of your Sex, that you would have commanded me to have given my Senti|ments upon that Subject in Writing. I grant you, <HI>Madam,</HI> you might have &s;po|ken
<PB N="126" REF="155">
to &s;everal of your Acquaintance, who would have undertaken the Bu&s;ine&s;s at fir&s;t Word, with all the Courage imaginable; but to me, who never dur&s;t take Pen in Hand to write any thing beyond a Billet, the Enterprize &s;eems very terrible. I con|fe&s;s, when you &s;poke to me of it fir&s;t, I was well enough plea&s;ed with the De&s;ign; for I thought a Defence of the Sex, would be a Means of obliging all of the Sex, who were worth defending; and therefore look'd upon it as the writing a Circular Love-Letter to all the fair Ladies in the King|dom. But as Men generally mix Intere&s;t with Honour, &s;o, upon &s;econd Thoughts, I con&s;idered what I &s;hould get by it, be|&s;ides Fame, if it &s;hould &s;ucceed; and I found, if I per&s;uaded all Men to be as pa&s;|&s;ionate Servants to the Ladies as my&s;elf, I &s;hould make but a very indifferent hand of it: Thus, <HI>Madam,</HI> you would engage me in a Controver&s;y, where it would be a Scandal to be vanqui&s;hed, and a Di&s;advan|tage to overcome: For I, who could never &s;ucceed in an Amour where there was any Fool pretended be&s;ides my&s;elf, &s;hould have great Hopes indeed, when I had per&s;uaded all Mankind to be my Rivals. After all, <HI>Madam,</HI> there were your Commands to encourge me to it; and the Commands of a fair Lady are to me beyond all the Ar|guments
<PB N="127" REF="156">
in Nature; I therefore re&s;olved upon the Undertaking. But as it is no new thing to &s;ee People undertake a Bu&s;ine&s;s that they are altogether unable to perform, &s;o I mu&s;t own, I found a thing of this Nature quite beyond my Strength: You may believe, <HI>Madam,</HI> I was very melan|choly at it, and it was then that a Friend coming into my Chamber, asked me the Occa&s;ion. As I never love to conceal any thing that afflicts me from a Friend, &s;o I pre&s;ently told him the Bu&s;ine&s;s, That a Lady had commanded me to write her a Treati&s;e in Defence of Women. If that be all (&s;ays he briskly) I am come to your Deliverance; for this very Morning have I been at a Conver&s;ation, where the Que|&s;tion concerning the Virtues and Vices of that Sex, has been handled as fully as can be de&s;ired. Thou appeare&s;t to me, my dear Friend, (&s;aid I, embracing him) like my better Genius, and therefore, without any farther Ceremony, &s;it down, and give me an Account of the Conference.</P>
<P>Taking a Walk (&s;ays he) this Morning in St. <HI>James</HI>'s <HI>Park,</HI> with &s;everal of my Acquaintance, there was one among the re&s;t who was all the while, either gazing upon the Ladies as they came by, or &s;peak|ing with that Indifference to us, that made

us very plainly &s;ee, he did not mind the Subject of our Di&s;cour&s;e, tho' we talked of all the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Things that offer them&s;elves in &s;uch Conver&s;ations. (A very &s;trange Man this, <HI>Madam,</HI> who was think|ing upon &s;ome Mi&s;tre&s;s, I warrant, when they were rai&s;ing Taxes, and beating the <HI>French.</HI>) Another, who was a Per&s;on of excellent Sen&s;e, and had a particular Friend|&s;hip for this, tho' they would often di&s;pute about their &s;everal Thoughts of Women, in which Point they could never agree; (I wonder they &s;hould di&s;pute about that, <HI>Madam,</HI> for the greate&s;t Di&s;putes in tho&s;e Ca&s;es are, when they do agree) began to rally him upon this Subject; which he did &s;o hand&s;omely, that he plea&s;ed the re&s;t of the Company very well, without di&s;plea&s;ing his Friend in the lea&s;t. PHILOGYNES (which was the Name of the fir&s;t, as MISOGYNES was of the other) (Here, <HI>Madam,</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I fancied my Friend put fal&s;e Names upon me; for be&s;ides, that I re|member neither of the&s;e Families in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> the one, you mu&s;t know, &s;ignifies a Woman-hater, and the other, a Woman-lover) cried to MISOGYNES, Tho' I allow you to rally me as much as you plea&s;e, and am glad of any Occa&s;ion I can give you, to exerci&s;e a Talent you po&s;&s;e&s;s in &s;o eminent a Degree, yet I hope you do not in earne&s;t
<PB N="129" REF="158">
think the Conver&s;ation of Women &s;o ridi|culous as you would make us believe. Ten times wor&s;e, &s;aid MISOGYNES, than I can repre&s;ent it; and &s;ince we have often had &s;light Skirmi&s;hes upon that Occa&s;ion, and we have now Time enough to fight it out, if you have the Courage to lo&s;e one Morn|ing's gazing at them, I challenge you to the private Walk by the Canal-&s;ide, to de|fend their Cau&s;e; and the&s;e Gentlemen, if they plea&s;e, &s;hall be our Judges. Tho' I am very unwilling, an&s;wered PHILOGYNES, to lo&s;e a Morning that has called out all the be&s;t Company of the Town, yet &s;ince it is in Defence of the Ladies, and you &s;o boldly challenge me, I take you at your Word, upon Condition, that if I get the better in the Judgment of the&s;e Gentlemen, you &s;hall engage to be in Love by To-mor|row Morning. Upon Condition, that if I overcome, &s;aid MISOGYNES, you will en|gage to be out of Love by the &s;ame Time, I agree. That is no equal Stake, replied PHILOGYNES, for it is to lay Happine&s;s again&s;t Unhappine&s;s; however, I am &s;o well &s;atisfied of my Cau&s;e, that I will undertake you, even upon tho&s;e Odds.</P>
<P>Upon this Agreement we walked all to the other &s;ide of the Park, full of Expecta|tion of the Event of the Debate; when we were come thither, we found we had

the whole Walk to our&s;elves, and &s;o MISO|GYNES who gave the Challenge, began in this manner:</P>
<P>The Propagation of Mankind being the only Way to pre&s;erve it from Extinction; and the Copulation with Women being the only Means that Nature has ordained to that End; there is no doubt but all Common|wealths ought to give any rea&s;onable En|couragements to it; I have therefore al|ways admir'd the Wi&s;dom of tho&s;e Go|vernments that incited, or compelled their Subjects to marry, as a Thing &s;o much more nece&s;&s;ary to Mankind in general, than plea&s;ing to any one in particular; but that a Man &s;hould, out of a mere Act of Judg|ment, run after Women; that he &s;hould find Delight in their Company, is &s;o very extraordinary, that the wi&s;e Men of old thought it hardly po&s;&s;ible, otherwi&s;e they had had no need of making &s;uch &s;evere Laws to force them to it, as they did.</P>
<P>Your Lady&s;hip, who is &s;o well ver&s;ed in <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Authors, knows, that among&s;t the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Plutarch</HI> in Life of <HI>Licurgus.</HI></BIBL></NOTE><HI>Spartans,</HI> they who lived long Batchelors were condemned to igno|minious Puni&s;hments, and debarred the Privileges of other Citizens. That the <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Strabo,</HI> Lib. 10.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>Cretans</HI> had a Law to compel all the
<PB N="131" REF="160">
hand&s;ome&s;t young Men to marry; as the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Diod. Sicul.</HI> B. 1.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>Thurians</HI> had to invite them to it, both by Honours and Rewards. That <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI> Lib. 4, &amp; 6.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>Plato</HI> ordains, that whoever lived a Batchelor to the five and thirtieth Year of his Age, &s;hould be capable of no Honour in his Commonwealth: And that the<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Aul.

<P>Notwith&s;tanding this, had you a De&s;ign of marrying them, I &s;hould not altogether &s;o much condemn you; nay, had you but a De&s;ign of enjoying them without it, there might be &s;omewhat &s;till alledged in your Excu&s;e. How unju&s;tifiable &s;oever &s;uch a De&s;ign may be, as to the moral Part, the Action it&s;elf is very agreeable to the natu|ral. But to pick them out only for the Benefit of their Conver&s;ation, to fall in Love with their Under&s;tandings, and to leave the Company of wi&s;e Men for hand|&s;ome Women, is ju&s;t the &s;ame Thing, as if you &s;hould chu&s;e rather to eat Jays and Parrots, than Woodcocks and Partridges, becau&s;e the Feathers of the former make the finer Shew.</P>

It is a very good, as well as a very ge|neral Way, to gue&s;s at People by the Com|pany they keep; and thus we may give a great Judgment of the Female Sex, by a View of tho&s;e with whom they are the mo&s;t plea&s;ed of our own. Well, let them appear then; what do you find? Fine Coats, large Cravat-&s;trings, and good Per|riwigs, I mu&s;t own, but for any Thing el&s;e, they, and their Perriwig Blocks are Critics alike. It is true, to do them Ju&s;tice, they talk mo&s;t learnedly of Points and Ribbons; have mo&s;t mathematical Heads for the erecting of Ladies Top-knots, make as con|&s;iderable Figures, talk as loud, and laugh more than any in Drawing-rooms and Play|hou&s;es; and tho&s;e who know nothing of their Language, would take them, by their Ge&s;tures, to be the wittie&s;t Per&s;ons in <HI>Chri&s;tendom;</HI> but if unluckily you under|&s;tand them, you will find it only fal&s;e Fire, and that all this violent Laughter is pro|duced by no Je&s;t. Then take them out of their own Element, begin a Di&s;cour&s;e of any Thing that is worth knowing, they are dumb; out of Mode&s;ty? No; but they hate to talk of Things that are <HI>gro&s;&s;ier;</HI> and the Pedantry of Scholars, and Gravity of Men of Bu&s;ine&s;s, is utterly unfit for a Gentleman.</P>

Were it nothing but the Company of &s;uch &s;ort of Creatures as the&s;e, it would be enough, I &s;hould think, to frighten a Man of Sen&s;e from them. Can you &s;ee the&s;e Fops, as much as you are u&s;ed to them, without laughing? except it rather makes you blu&s;h to think you &s;hould bring your&s;elf into Competition with &s;uch Tools as they are: I am far from blaming them for fol|lowing the Ladies: They avoid the Com|pany of Men who de&s;pi&s;e them, for that of Women who admire them: Nor do I find fault with the Ladies, for being plea&s;ed with them; for &s;ince Likene&s;s, they &s;ay, breeds Love, what Wonder is it they are fond of tho&s;e Men who&s;e Follies make them mo&s;t like them&s;elves? but for a Man who has &s;ome Pretences to Wit and Learning; for one who might be acceptable to Men of Sen&s;e, to run after them; nay, for a Man who &s;pends all the Morning in the Study of <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> to &s;pend the Afternoon among the Impertinencies of Women, puts me in mind of the Moun|tebank Stages in <HI>Naples,</HI> where the Je&s;uits and Jackpuddings entertain the Spectators by Turns.</P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible, you will &s;ay, that all this makes for you; that the Faults of your Rivals render your Virtues the more re|markable, and that there is no doubt, but
<PB N="134" REF="163">
a Man of Merit may &s;ucceed in any Place where a Man of no Merit may pretend; but, alas! Sir, you deceive your&s;elf very much, if you encourage that Opinion. Had you fit Judges, there is no doubt but you were in the right: But if the faire&s;t Lady in <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> were among&s;t the <HI>Indians,</HI> where they paint the Devil of her Colour, do you expect they &s;hould do her Beauty Ju&s;tice? Or if a &s;lender Man were among the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> do you think they would admire him for being well &s;haped, where they thought none but big-belly'd Men to be &s;o? Credit me, Sir, a Man who leaves his Parts to the Judgment of Women, is very near the &s;ame Circum&s;tances: Will you not believe me in that Ca&s;e, becau&s;e I profe&s;s an Enmity to them? You do well: but will you believe them&s;elves? View all the Town, take good Notice: Among all the young Heire&s;&s;es who run away from their Guardians, is there any one who does it with a Man of Sen&s;e? Among all tho&s;e Widows who ruin them&s;elves by &s;econd Marriages, is there any one who does it with a Man of Sen&s;e? Among all tho&s;e Ladies who cuckold their Husbands, is there any one who does it with a Man of Sen&s;e? We &s;ee them do the&s;e Things every Day, with Chaplains, Dancing-ma&s;ters, Butlers, and Footmen. Who are the Men that &s;hew
<PB N="135" REF="164">
the tender Billets received? What are they who boa&s;t of the Favours of all the fine&s;t Women in Town? Are they not the mo&s;t de&s;picable of Mankind? Are they not &s;uch who&s;e Conver&s;ation is the Je&s;t of Men of Sen&s;e? And have they above one Thing about them, that di&s;tingui&s;hes them from the other Sex?</P>
<P>After all, Sir, are not the <HI>Women</HI> in the right in this Point? Or do they ever &s;hew more Judgment, than when they pitch upon &s;uch Men? What do they look for in a Husband, but one who will admire them, who will be governed by them, and upon whom all their little Tricks will pa&s;s? And who but Fools are fit for that? What do they propo&s;e in a Gallant, but giving them Plea&s;ure without Scandal? And to the for|mer Part they have a received Notion of the Ability of Fools: Then for the Scan|dal, who &s;o likely to give none as tho&s;e Men, whom the World will hardly believe were favoured by them, tho' they took their Oaths upon it? For notwith&s;tanding Experience teaches us the contrary, yet People are apt to fancy, a Man of Sen&s;e mu&s;t &s;ucceed before a Coxcomb; and will rather believe the former are favoured, tho' they &s;wear they are not; than the latter, tho' they &s;wear they are.</P>

(I confe&s;s, Madam, this &s;eems to me but a very indifferent Ex|cu&s;e for the Widows; for he would make us believe, it is but next Oars with them; and &s;o I told my Friend; but he reply'd, I mu&s;t con&s;ider, it is only tho&s;e Widows who make an ill Choice, about which he is to &s;peak; and as he cannot &s;ay of them, as of the young Maids, that it was for want of &s;eeing the World; &s;o they mu&s;t be con|tented with this Excu&s;e, or make a better for them&s;elves.) For the Wives, who you &s;ay cuckold their Hu&s;bands, there may be &s;ome|what
<PB N="172" REF="201">
more to be &s;aid. Mode&s;ty being almo&s;t an in&s;eparable Quality of Wit, there is no Wonder that a Man who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that, &s;hould &s;o &s;eldom &s;ucceed in the&s;e Under|takings; whil&s;t Fools, by their natural Impudence pu&s;h on the Thing; and mar|ried Women are a &s;ort of Forts that are &s;ooner taken by Storm than Treaty. So that this &s;hews rather the great Confidence of the Man, than the little Judgment of the Woman; who it is forty to one had much rather a Man of Sen&s;e was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of her, if he would take the &s;ame Methods to gain her as the other had done.</P>
<P>(After all, Madam, I think none of the&s;e Excu&s;es extraordinary; therefore if I were worthy to advi&s;e the Ladies, they &s;hould rather make U&s;e of Men of Wit in all the&s;e Capacities, than put their Friends to the Trouble of inventing &s;uch pitiful Defences for them.)</P>
<P>Now, Sir, as I cannot &s;ee any Rea&s;on why Women &s;hould naturally love Fools more than Men of Wit, &s;o I &s;hall very hardly be brought to believe they do. In a Hu&s;band I &s;uppo&s;e they propo&s;e a Man who&s;e Conver&s;ation &s;hall be agreeable as well as his Per&s;on; and who &s;hall have Wit to entertain them, as well as Wi&s;dom to direct them; and in whom can this be found, but in Men of the be&s;t Sen&s;e? If in
<PB N="173" REF="202">
a Gallant, as you &s;ay, they propo&s;e Plea|&s;ure without Scandal, tis very hard the Heat that warms a Man's Brain, &s;hould &s;o en|tirely &s;ettle there, as to render him inca|pable of plea&s;ing them otherwi&s;e; though it is po&s;&s;ible, by rea&s;on of his having Varie|ty of Thoughts to divert him, he may not give him&s;elf &s;o entirely up to tho&s;e Plea|&s;ures, as People le&s;s capable of thinking do: And for the Scandal, who &s;o proper to hinder that, as tho&s;e who have Prudence to manage Things &s;o as not to be found out, and Wit enough to turn it off if they are? Whil&s;t a Fool by his Want of Sen&s;e &s;hall quickly make the Thing public, if there be an Intrigue, or by his Vanity brag of one, though there be none. Add to this, that when a Woman &s;eems plea&s;ed with a Man of Wit, every body is apt to attribute it to the Plea&s;ure of his Conver&s;a|tion; whereas, when &s;he is fond of a Man, in whom we can &s;ee nothing to be liked, we naturally &s;uppo&s;e &s;he likes him for &s;omething that we do not &s;ee: And though it is po&s;&s;ible it may be only Want of Judg|ment in the Lady, yet the World is apt to compliment her Under&s;tanding in that Ca&s;e, to the Prejudice of her Reputation. And to conclude, Sir, though I do not believe all tho&s;e Men &s;ucce&s;sful who &s;ay they are not, yet I am very much inclined to believe

<P>I have as great a Veneration for tho&s;e Poets you mention, as any Man can; and upon that Account I &s;hall not believe all the Ill they &s;ay of their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, becau&s;e I &s;uppo&s;e they would not have me: As I have been a Lover my&s;elf, &s;o I know very well that People are apt in tho&s;e Ca&s;es to take Su&s;picions for Realities, and Surmi&s;es for Matter of Fact.

<PB N="176" REF="205">
and would not any one who came in when he was in one of his Rants, conclude, a Man who loved &s;o well, would not be en|raged again&s;t a Mi&s;tre&s;s at that rate, unle&s;s her Fal&s;hood was very apparent? And yet when we come to examine the Cau&s;e of this Di&s;order, what is it, but <HI>Morats</HI> giv|ing him his Life at her Reque&s;t, or his leaning upon her Lap when he died. I rather mention this than any of the Poets you &s;poke of, not only becau&s;e all the Mo|tions and Pa&s;&s;ions of a Lover are de&s;cribed with as much Art and Delicacy, as in any of tho&s;e Antients, but al&s;o, that &s;eeing the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s before you, you may judge of every little Cau&s;e of his Di&s;order, as well as he him&s;elf, which in Odes and Elegies you cannot do. You &s;ee the Lover there in a Fury, but what Cau&s;e he has to be &s;o, there is no body to tell you, but he who is in it. Add to this, that a Man often feigns Jealou&s;y of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, to binder her from being &s;o of him, and will upbraid her Fal&s;hood to defend his own. (That is a Thing, now I confe&s;s, Madam, which I can hardly believe.) And it is evident, they had not really any &s;uch bad Opinion of Women, &s;ince with all this they did not cea&s;e to run after them. However, if you think the&s;e general An&s;wers not &s;ufficient, let us &s;ee what we can &s;ay to Particulars.
<PB N="177" REF="206">
For the Complaints of Cruelty and Scorn. I look upon them as Things of Cour&s;e; and therefore, &s;hall &s;ay nothing to them. If <HI>Anacreon</HI>'s Mi&s;tre&s;s did a&s;k him nothing but Money, why did he chu&s;e one who&s;e Nece&s;&s;ities drove her upon it. And if other Men have made Complaints of the Wo|mens minding Wealth more than Love; I de&s;ire to know whether Women have not as much Rea&s;on to make the &s;ame Com|plaints of the Men. And for tho&s;e who talk of their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Incon&s;tancy, let us &s;ee fir&s;t whether they were con&s;tant to them. For <HI>Ovid,</HI> he does not pretend to put it upon you, but complains in <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Eleg. 1 L. 10. 1.</BIBL></NOTE>one Place of his being in Love with two at once, and tells you frankly in <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Eleg. 4.

For <HI>Horace, Suetonius,</HI> (or whoever it was that writ his Life) informs you that he was intemperately given to Women; and what Wonder then, that a Man who try'd &s;o ma|ny, &s;hould find one or two fal&s;e. <HI>Tibul|lus</HI> had two <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Delia.

he tells us the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Rumor ait crebro no&s;tram pecca&s;&s;e putam.</L>
<L>Quid mi&s;erum torques Rumor acerbe tace.</L></Q></NOTE> Report was, that his Mi&s;tre&s;s was kind to other Men; yet the Report gave him &s;o much Torment, that he de&s;ired it &s;hould be &s;tifled; if therefore you have any Friend&s;hip for him, endea|vour to fulfil his De&s;ire in that Point. For <HI>Propertius,</HI> be&s;ides his <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>A&s;pice uti coelo modo Sol, modo Luna mini&s;trat,</L>

Thus whatever Qualifications tho&s;e great Men had, Con|&s;tancy, you, &s;ee was none; and though we allow you, each of them had Merit enough for any one Woman, yet one Man can hardly have enough for half a Score.</P>
<P>Now if Ruin and De&s;olation has come to great Men, and States, from Women, it &s;hewed they had a good Opinion of the Sex in general, that they would &s;uffer for them; and had they not been &s;en&s;ible the greate&s;t Part were good, they could never have been impo&s;ed upon by the Bad. Then as for tho&s;e ill Women whom you have
<PB N="179" REF="208">
mentioned, as I &s;uppo&s;e you will not un|dertake to defend all the Actions of Ty|rants and Murderers; &s;o I do not think my|&s;elf at all obliged to defend all the Women who have been guilty of &s;ome of their Crimes. The Di&s;pute is not whether there have been any ill Women in the World, but whether there are not more Good. And when I have told you that the Book that condemns <HI>Dalilah,</HI> cries up <HI>De|borah</HI> and <HI>Jael:</HI> That if <HI>Homer</HI> has repre|&s;ented <HI>Helen</HI> guilty of &s;ome Faults (for you will &s;ee that <HI>Homer</HI> does not repre&s;ent her Cau&s;e &s;o violently bad) he tells us of <HI>Hecuba</HI> and <HI>Andromache,</HI> and a Thou&s;and others who were very good ones; That if <HI>Clytemne&s;tra</HI> was fal&s;e to <HI>Agamemnon, Penelope</HI> was as famous for her Truth to <HI>Uly&s;&s;es;</HI> and &s;o put you Example again&s;t Example, which I forbear to do, only becau&s;e it is &s;o very ea|&s;y; &s;hould I, I &s;ay, do but this, you could not complain that your Arguments were unan&s;wered. But truly, Sir, we might carry the Thing much farther; we might defend &s;ome of tho&s;e Women you mention|ed, and excu&s;e the re&s;t. For <HI>Dalilah</HI> I &s;hall &s;ay &s;ay nothing, out of Re&s;pect to the Scripture, that repre&s;ents her as an ill Woman; it is po&s;&s;ible, were &s;he alive, &s;he might tell you in her own Defence, that what Account you have of her, is from
<PB N="80" REF="209">
her profe&s;&s;ed Enemies: That however taking the Thing as they tell it; if &s;he did commit a Piece of Treachery, it was again&s;t an Enemy of her Country; and that it was very hard &s;he &s;hould be &s;o much run down for the &s;ame Thing they have &s;o much admired in <HI>Jael</HI> and <HI>Judith,</HI> as well as every body el&s;e did in <HI>Marcus Bru|tus;</HI> &s;he would perhaps pu&s;h her Defence further, and tell you, that though &s;he de|liver'd <HI>Sam&s;on</HI> to the <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> to be kept Pri&s;oner, yet &s;he neither drove a Nail through his Head, nor cut it off. But for <HI>Helen,</HI> give me Leave to tell you, it is a great Di&s;pute among&s;t the Hi&s;torians, whether &s;he was forced away by <HI>Paris,</HI> or went by her own Con&s;ent; &s;everal are of the former Opinion; and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prologom. ad Apollon.</NOTE><HI>Hoelztzim</HI> &s;ays plainly, he wonders <HI>Homer</HI> will put &s;uch a ridiculous Story upon the World, as to make her the Occa&s;ion of the <HI>Trojan</HI> War.

And as for <HI>Deianira</HI> and <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> whatever Fata|lity arrived to their Lovers from them, may certainly be very well excu&s;ed upon the Innocence of their Intentions, and their Pu|ni&s;hment of them&s;elves afterwards, the one hanging, the other poi&s;oning her&s;elf. If the <HI>Capuan</HI> Women de&s;troyed <HI>Hannibal</HI>'s Army, they de&s;troyed a Body of Enemies that all the Men in <HI>Italy</HI> could not. In like manner, for your other In&s;tances we might tell you, that <HI>Procopius,</HI> who tells tho&s;e terrible Stories of <HI>Theodora, Anecdota,</HI> is &s;o very pa&s;&s;ionate all along, and mixes &s;uch ridiculous Fables with what he tells, that there is no great Credit to be given to him. (This <HI>Procopius</HI> was a Soldier un|der <HI>Ju&s;tinian,</HI> and has writ, among&s;t other Things, a &s;ecret Hi&s;tory of tho&s;e Times: In this he repre&s;ents the Empre&s;s <HI>Theodora</HI>

<P>We might tell you farther, Sir, that this Mode&s;ty too often hinders them from make|ing their Virtues known: That they are not of tho&s;e eternal Scriblers who are con|tinually plagueing the World with their Works; and that it is not the Vanity of
<PB N="191" REF="220">
getting a Name, which &s;everal of the greate&s;t Men of the World have owned to be the Cau&s;e of their writing, that is the Cau&s;e of the Womens. Had not <HI>Sapho</HI> been &s;o much in Love, it is po&s;&s;ible we had never heard any Mention of one of the greate&s;t Wits that ever was born; had not <HI>Cicero</HI> and <HI>Quintilian</HI> given us Accounts of <HI>Cor|nelia,</HI> and the Daughters of <HI>Laelius,</HI> and <HI>Horten&s;ius,</HI> they had never done it them|&s;elves; had not <HI>Jane Gray</HI> been put to Death, her Virtues had never been &s;o much taken notice of; had not the <HI>Portugueze</HI> Nun been de&s;erted by her Gallant, we had mi&s;&s;ed &s;ome of the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate Letters that the&s;e latter Ages have pro|duced; and had not <HI>Anna Maria Schur|man</HI>'s Works been publi&s;hed by a Friend, without her Con&s;ent, we had lo&s;t the Be|nefit of them. We may tell you too, that it is not only in re&s;pect of their own Sex that they are admired, but even of ours. That of tho&s;e two Odes we have yet of <HI>Sapho,</HI> we owe one to <HI>Diony&s;ius Halicar|na&s;&s;aeus,</HI> the other to <HI>Longin,</HI> the two be&s;t Critics of <HI>Greece,</HI> who cho&s;e them out for Examples to their Rules, before any of the Mens: That the Epi&s;tle of <HI>Sapho</HI> to <HI>Phaon,</HI> which is e&s;teemed the mo&s;t delicate of <HI>Ovid</HI>'s, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be taken out of her Writings: That <HI>Corinna</HI> was five Times

<P>We may tell you too, that granting the equal Capacities of both Sexes, it is a greater Wonder to find one Learned Woman, than a hundred Learned Men, con&s;idering the Difference of their Educations. If you &s;hould go into <HI>Greece,</HI> and, &s;eeing the Ig|norance is among them at pre&s;ent, tell them their Countrymen were incapable of learn|ing, would you not be very well &s;atisfied, when they told you of the <HI>Platos</HI> and <HI>Ari|&s;totles</HI> of Antiquity? And that if they had not as famous Men now, it was becau&s;e they have not the &s;ame Advantages they had then? And pray why may not the Women be allowed the &s;ame Excu&s;e? Will you by your Laws and Cu&s;toms en|deavour to keep them ignorant, and then blame them for being &s;o? And forbid all

<P>Upon &s;econd Thoughts I hope, Sir, you will allow, that Women may have Wit and Learning; for their Courage and Con|duct we may po&s;&s;ibly &s;ay more anon.

<P>But it is generally agreed that all Virtues are requi&s;ite for tho&s;e who govern well; and &s;ince there are &s;ome Countries where Women are excluded from the Throne, and no Country where they are not po&s;t|poned, it would be convenient, methinks, to &s;ee what they do, when by Accident they are placed upon it. I &s;hall not trouble you here with <HI>Deborah,</HI> nor <HI>E&s;ther,</HI> nor as much as mention <HI>Semiramis,</HI> though you have mentioned her upon another Occa|&s;ion; and yet certainly the Bravery of mo&s;t of her Actions ought to make us forget the Faults of &s;ome few; but I &s;hall confine my&s;elf within the Bounds of our own Country.</P>

her di&s;pirited Countrymen with a Re&s;olu|tion of throwing off that Yoke which was grown intolerable to be born. It is true, indeed, the End was not an&s;werable to the Succe&s;&s;es of the Beginning; nor to the Glory &s;o heroic an Undertaking de&s;erved; however as it was neither Want of Courage nor Conduct in her, &s;o we ought to render her that Veneration which is due to &s;o re&s;olute an Enterprize.</P>
<P>But as one of the greate&s;t Attempts the <HI>Britons</HI> made for their Liberty was whil&s;t they were led by a Woman, &s;o we mu&s;t own the greate&s;t Glory our Nation could ever boa&s;t, was under the Government of one of the &s;ame Sex. It was in the Time of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> that this I&s;land arrived at that Pitch of Greatne&s;s, to which it had been a&s;cending for &s;everal Ages, and from which it has been declining, till very lately, ever &s;ince: It is the Name of this Prince&s;s that is dearer to all <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> than the Names of all the Monarchs &s;ince the Con|que&s;t be&s;ides, and the only one who&s;e Birth|day has been celebrated after her Death, by the voluntary Gratitude of the People.</P>
<P>But however we may forget Things that are pa&s;t, let us not over&s;ee that which lies before our Eyes; and &s;ince the Occa&s;ion is &s;o very fair, I know not how we can omit the &s;hewing our Sen&s;e of tho&s;e Virtues, of
<PB N="212" REF="241">
which the whole Nation has demon&s;trated &s;o grateful an Acknowledgment by the Body of their Repre&s;entatives; and never were they more truly their Repre&s;entatives before. Yes, Sir, without going to foreign Countries, without &s;earching the Hi&s;tories of our own, we have even in our own Time, and our own Country, a Prince&s;s who has governed to their general Sati&s;|faction, a People the mo&s;t curious to pry into the Faults of their Governors, of any People under the Sun. A Prince&s;s, who though &s;he never &s;hewed any Fondne&s;s of Vain-glory, or Authority, yet when the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Kingdom called her to the Helm, managed Affairs with that Dexte|rity, which is very rarely found in tho&s;e who are the mo&s;t ambitious of Command. Every Thing during that little Time of her Government, was ordered with that Cou|rage, Conduct, and Prudence, that her greate&s;t Friends cannot find Eloquence enough to commend, nor her greate&s;t Enemies the lea&s;t Pretences to condemn. Though &s;he had a Husband venturing his Life in another Country, with a Bravery equal to what has made us &s;u&s;pect the Sto|ries of Antiquity; tho' our Fleet, the Bul|warks of the Nation, was managed in a Manner the Courage of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Seamen was utterly unacquainted with; tho' a
<PB N="213" REF="242">
Monarch, who thinks him&s;elf able to con|tend with all <HI>Europe</HI> together, &s;eemed to make his utmo&s;t Efforts again&s;t a Prince&s;s, who had nothing but the univer&s;al Hearts of her Subjects to defend her; tho' all Chri&s;tendom was in Su&s;pence to &s;ee the Event of the Undertaking, and every little Prince had forgot his own Danger to con|template hers; even at this Time did we &s;ee her look with all the Unconcern ima|ginable, and whil&s;t every Body el&s;e was alarmed for her Safety, &s;he only &s;eemed to have known nothing of the Danger. Not that this Unconcern proceeded from any Ignorance of her Condition, or unrea&s;on|able Contempt of her Adver&s;ary; no, &s;he provided again&s;t their Attempts with all the Prudence could be wi&s;hed for, at the &s;ame Time that &s;he looked upon the Danger with all the Courage in Nature.</P>
<P>But however great the&s;e Virtues may appear, when they are &s;et off by the Lu&s;tre of a public Command, yet they are in Effect much greater, when they teach Peo|ple to de&s;pi&s;e all &s;uch dazling Trifles. Here it is, Sir, that we have a fre&s;h Field for Eloquence, when we &s;ee a Lady di&s;&s;atisfied at that Glory which &s;he had to every Bodies Satisfaction be&s;ide, and grudge her&s;elf that Authority, which &s;he owed to the Ab&s;ence of a Husband whom &s;he loved &s;o much
<PB N="214" REF="243">
better than that. What think you, Sir, of that Alacrity, of that Joy with which &s;he re&s;igned up the Government? Does it not put you in mind of the old <HI>Roman</HI> Gene|rals, who quitted their Plough to command an Army, and when the Victory was gain'd, returned with greater Content to their Plough again? This is that Wi&s;dom which we &s;hould admire; this is that Virtue which we &s;hould adore; and we ought to de&s;pi&s;e all tho&s;e little Pretenders to Bu&s;ine&s;s, who thru&s;t them&s;elves into the Management of Affairs again&s;t every Bodies Will but their own; and having neither Virtue nor Pru|dence enough to retire from it at the uni|ver&s;al Murmurs of the People, are gene|rally made Sacrifices at la&s;t to the ju&s;t Re|&s;entment of an enraged Nation.</P>
<P>The&s;e are tho&s;e blazing Comets, who&s;e fatal Glories portend De&s;truction to a Go|vernment, whil&s;t the Virtues of the others, like tho&s;e of the Sun, give it Life and Heat, by their benign Influence. Much more, Sir, might be &s;aid in <HI>Defence</HI> of the <HI>Sex,</HI> which I &s;hall purpo&s;ely omit, becau&s;e I am &s;atisfied I can never conclude with a more illu&s;trious Example.</P>

<P>All that I can &s;ay, Sir, is, that the Gen|tleman is a very worthy <HI>Gentleman;</HI> and his Lady a very fine <HI>Lady.</HI> He has often,
<PB N="222" REF="251">
indeed, bragg'd to me of the Happine&s;s of a marry'd Life. I thought the be&s;t Way to find out this Happine&s;s, was in going to his Lady, who has fully convinced me of all her Husband &s;aid. But as I have a perfect Friend&s;hip for the Gentleman, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, Sir, I am as well &s;atisfied with his having a fine <HI>Wife,</HI> as if I had <HI>one</HI> my&s;elf.</P>

<P>I confe&s;s, Sir, I have nothing to &s;ay in Contradiction to the&s;e Gentlemen. All that the one &s;ays, and the other would in|&s;inuate, may be true for aught I know; nor do I think it much worth my While to enquire after it. Half the Town, the fir&s;t &s;ays, laugh at me for being a <HI>Cuckold;</HI> and he would have me make it public, that the other Half might laugh at me too. But pray let us con&s;ider how much wi&s;er he acts: He marry'd a <HI>Wife,</HI> who by the way is not extreamly taking; and yet you cannot imagine what Care, what Con|trivances, what cunning Stratagems, this wi&s;e Per&s;on made U&s;e of to &s;earch out a Thing, which, after all, he did not care to
<PB N="223" REF="252">
find. And though with all his Bu&s;tle he could find out nothing that really made again&s;t her, yet he has ca&s;t her off with Infamy and Shame, chiefly indeed to him|&s;elf, for u&s;ing a Wo man ill who never gave him Occa&s;ion for it. If there be &s;o many who laugh at me for a tame Husband, let him hearken after his own Concerns, and he will find a much greater Number who rail at him for a ba&s;e and ill-natur'd one.</P>
<P>Now for this bri&s;k <HI>Mon&s;ieur</HI> here, for this <HI>fini&s;hed</HI> Gentleman, who can with &s;o much Delicacy rally the poor <HI>Fools</HI> that <HI>marry!</HI> So very ingenious a Per&s;on, no doubt, acts much more wi&s;ely him&s;elf. Lord, how is his E&s;tate divided? One Part upon Taylors; another upon Milli|ners; a third upon Perfumers; a fourth upon Perriwig-makers. All his Time &s;pent between the Toilet, the Play-hou&s;e, the Park, and Drawing-Room. And upon what noble De&s;ign, pray, is all this Time and all this Money wa&s;ted? Even, Gen|tlemen, that this mo&s;t charming Per&s;on of his, may attain that with all this Co&s;t which I received Twenty Thou&s;and Pound for doing. Would his Nicene&s;s be con|tented with the Meat that had been tum|bled, and cold upon my Trencher? Tru|ly, Sir, his Happine&s;s is little more than

this, I that am the <HI>Fool,</HI> come to her when I will, &s;tay with her as long as I will, and command her as I will; while this wi&s;e Gentleman is waiting a fro&s;ty Night under her Window, breaking his Brains for Songs and Billets for her; bribing her Women, lo&s;ing his Re&s;t, and venturing the being abu&s;ed, kicked down Stairs, and having his Throat cut whenever he happens to be found out.</P>

He does not pretend that Poetry makes People happy in this World, becau&s;e we very plainly &s;ee the contrary; but he plea&s;es him&s;elf with a vain Rever&s;ion of imaginary Honours that he is never to enjoy till he him&s;elf is in&s;en&s;ible of them.

Who leads a fal&s;e di&s;&s;embling Life; fawning upon tho&s;e who treat him in&s;olently, and treating tho&s;e in&s;olently who fawn upon him? Who values him&s;elf upon the bearing other Peoples Burdens, for which the only Thanks he gets, is Envy, or Contempt: Envy if he &s;ucceed, and Contempt if he fail? Should a Man, who came late to an Inn, in&s;tead of taking the Re&s;t that was requi&s;ite to refre&s;h him for the next Day's Journey, enter into Cabals, form De&s;igns, and manage Intrigues to get the be&s;t Room in the Hou&s;e, which would make him very unea&s;y if he fail'd of it; and from which, tho' he &s;ucceeded, he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily depart the next Morning; would not this Man appear ridiculou&s;ly fooli&s;h, and contemptible to all the World?

of the World, to pronounce all Men Mad be&s;ide.

Do you ask me then, who is this Wi&s;e Man that I have mentioned? It is he who places not his Felicity in his Beauty, his Wealth, or his Learning; who de&s;ires no Plea&s;ure, who fears no Pain: Whom the Frowns of For|tune cannot deject, nor her Smiles exalt: Who is happy in Pri&s;ons, in Bani&s;hments, in Torments: Who, if he were broiling in <HI>Phalaris</HI>'s BULL, would cry out, <HI>How plea|&s;ant is this!</HI> It matters not how many Ar|rows Fortune aims at him, &s;ince he is im|penetrable to them all.

When that fooli&s;h King darkened the Day with his Arrows, there was not one of them which reached the Sun; when the Chains were ca&s;t into the Sea, they could not bind the Waves; and tho&s;e who de&s;troy the Tem|ples, do no Injury to the Divinity: In like Manner, whatever is done proudly, mali|ciou&s;ly, or in&s;olently, again&s;t a Wi&s;e Man, (who is in nothing different from a God, but in Point of Time) is but attempted in vain.</P>

<P><HI>Mercury,</HI> thou art a &s;wift Me&s;&s;enger, ha&s;te away to <HI>Jupiter,</HI> inform him of what we have done, and know his further Plea|&s;ure in the Matter: You may tell him, that upon a full Survey of Mankind it appears, that every one has &s;uch a <HI>&s;ufficient Share of Folly,</HI> that he has no Rea&s;on at all to com|plain of his Neighbours having more. That in An&s;wer to tho&s;e who think their Folly ob&s;tructs their Happine&s;s, it is very plain, that the Happine&s;s of Mankind is &s;o com|plicated with this Folly, that it is impo&s;&s;i|ble to cure them of the one, without endan|gering the other too. Should we convince the <HI>Fool</HI> who &s;quanders away his Money, that he might live to want it; &s;hould we convince the <HI>Fool</HI> who heaps up Trea&s;ure, that in a little Time he mu&s;t die, and have
<PB N="240" REF="269">
all his Trea&s;ure taken from him; &s;hould we convince the <HI>Husband,</HI> who places his Happine&s;s in his Wife and Children, that the one cuckolds him, and the other are none of his; &s;hould we convince the <HI>Man</HI> who does Things to be eternally famous, that after Death he will have no Sen&s;e of Fame, or of whatever is &s;aid of him; we &s;hould make them all mi&s;erable and wretch|ed. On the other Side, by taking away their Folly, we &s;hou'd take away one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful Qualities in the World, &s;ince it is very evident, that Mankind live upon the Follies of one another. Were there not <HI>Fools</HI> who &s;ell E&s;tates, what would become of the <HI>Fools</HI> who buy them? Were there not <HI>Fools</HI> who marry, human Kind would come to an End. Were there not <HI>Fools</HI> of Bu&s;ine&s;s, how would the <HI>Fools</HI> that meddle with no Bu&s;ine&s;s be managed?

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I receiv'd your generous Pre&s;ent two Days after the Date, yet the Affairs of my Parents, and the Commands of a noble Lady,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lady <HI>Delawar.</HI></NOTE> have harra&s;s'd me &s;o much, that I could not get Time to return my Thanks &s;ooner. I doubt you'll quickly be convinc'd you have formed a very unju&s;t Idea of me; for I prote&s;t, on a Self-Examination, I can't find one of tho&s;e good Qualities you lay to my Charge. However, 'tis highly obliging in you, to fancy me ingenious and agreeable, 'till you know the contrary; as &s;uch, I accept the Compliment, and acknowledge your un|common Candor. The Que&s;tion now is, Whether I ought not to &s;top here, and pre|&s;erve your favourable Opinion by my Silence, rather than hazard it by a farther Di&s;covery of my Ignorance? The fir&s;t is certainly mo&s;t prudent, but the latter, being more ju&s;t, I think it a Point of Honour to undeceive you, and di&s;pel the fal&s;e Charms of an imaginary Pro&s;pect. Your <HI>American</HI> Simile
<PB N="9" REF="279">
would have been proper enough for me, but I can by no Means allow you to make U&s;e on't, neither can I admit of a Barter &s;o exceedingly di&s;advantageous to my Cor|re&s;pondent. No, Sir, I'll pre&s;erve your fini&s;h'd Poems as a Standard of good Ver&s;e, but I &s;hall not pretend to traffic with you, becau&s;e I never wrote any Thing that pleas'd my&s;elf; and &s;urely if an Author can't &s;atisfy her own Judgment, 'tis in vain to expect &s;he &s;hould plea&s;e others.</P>
<P>I hope you'll be contented with this An&s;wer, becau&s;e 'tis Truth; and I hope al&s;o, that if I &s;hould not &s;end &s;o quick a Return to your Letters, as you may expect, or as they de&s;erve, you will not pre&s;ently accu&s;e me of Di&s;re&s;pect; for, what with the continued Weakne&s;s of my Grand|mother, and the nece&s;&s;ary Concerns of Life, I have &s;o little Time at my own Di&s;po&s;al, that I dare not promi&s;e a con&s;tant Corre|&s;pondence, le&s;t I &s;hould engage for more than I can perform. I conjure you, by your mo&s;t beloved Mu&s;e, never more to call any Thing of mine <HI>excellent,</HI> &s;ince, in my Opinion, <HI>unmerited Prai&s;e</HI> is no better than <HI>civil Lampoon.</HI> I &s;hould pity your hard Fate in living among &s;uch <HI>un&s;ociable Ani|mals,</HI> did I not believe that a <HI>wi&s;e Man</HI> &s;corns to be beholden to <HI>Fortune</HI> for a pre|carious Happine&s;s; and that you are this

Is there no &s;hining Exception, no generous Mind who has Fortitude enough to re&s;i&s;t the malig|nant Particles of its native Air? Yes, yes, you will confe&s;s, I know you will, that Mrs. <HI>Martland</HI> has Learning, Virtue, Wit, and good Humour, &s;ufficient to atone for the Vices, Folly, and Ill-nature of a much larger City than <HI>Winche&s;ter.</HI> How then can you complain of <HI>Solitude?</HI> or how can you call that Place dull, where our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> SAPHO re&s;ides? SAPHO was the Name Mr. CROMWELL cho&s;e for her, and not unde|&s;ervedly, her excellent Ver&s;es requiring a nobler Epithet, if the Records of Time had afforded it.

the Heart to apply my Mind to any thing but the un&s;ociable Companions of an unea&s;y Being, Sorrow and Di&s;content; and how long it would have continu'd upon me, had not the prevailing Thoughts of Fair CORINNA rous'd me from that Lethargy of Temper, I cannot well determine. Stu|pidity and In&s;ipidne&s;s are the Epidemical Di&s;tempers of our Town; therefore it is no Wonder that my Spirits, naturally prone to Dullne&s;s, &s;hould &s;o &s;oon catch the reigning Contagion.

you mu&s;t know, that our <HI>Ladies</HI> here, like <HI>Snails,</HI> keep every one in their own <HI>Shell,</HI> and are wond'rous &s;hy of Men Vi&s;itants.

to compo&s;e a Picture, highly fini&s;hed, of the Greate&s;t Man, and the mo&s;t Skilful Governor.</P>
<P>However, when I think of filling this Po&s;t, now fallen to my Lot, and con&s;ider my own Abilities, there ari&s;es a Dread and Diffidence &s;ufficient to confound and over|whelm me; nor am I ever &s;o di&s;pirited or out of love with my&s;elf, as when <HI>Fell</HI> and <HI>Aldrich,</HI> tho&s;e two great Luminaries of your Commonwealth of Letters, pre&s;ent them&s;elves to my Remembrance; for who has not Rea&s;on to dread treading in the Paths they trod, who (being endowed with the choice&s;t Gifts of Nature, furni&s;hed with a great Variety of Arts, exerci&s;ed in a long Tract of Academical Employments) brought this Hou&s;e, which ever had its Share of Glory, ever illu&s;trious for its Prai&s;e of Learning, to the utmo&s;t Pitch of Splendor and Perfection.</P>
<P>Both of them were eagerly &s;tudious of Knowledge, and earne&s;tly di&s;po&s;ed to culti|vate the liberal Sciences: Both of them were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with extraordinary Candour, &s;o as to cheri&s;h every Appearance of Virtue that pre&s;ented it&s;elf, ever interpreting fa|vourably and to the milder Sen&s;e, whatever bore the Face of Doubt: Both of them were noble and generous, not carried away with the Thir&s;t of Riches or of Honours:
<PB N="38" REF="308">
They were carele&s;s of their private Affairs, but vigilant for the Public Good: No Man ever loved his Family more ardently, or cheri&s;hed it with more Affection, than both of them did this Hou&s;e: No Man's Country was ever dearer to him, than this Univer&s;ity to them: By their own Labour, by their own Co&s;t, to increa&s;e the Art of Printing, to repair, to rebuild the&s;e Walls; as it was always a Care to them, &s;o was it a Plea&s;ure: With the&s;e Thoughts, with the&s;e De&s;ires were they employ'd when liv|ing, nor was there any Intermi&s;&s;ion to the Hour of their Deaths. You are not un|acquainted with the Things I &s;peak of, which &s;o lately were, and &s;till are in your Sight and Hearing; but be they rivetted ever &s;o &s;trongly in your Minds, the Repeti|tion of them will always be a Plea&s;ure, and the Remembrance of them delightful, who excelled in every Qualification that could be in Man. The Image of that mo&s;t humane Man can never be forgot by me or you, by who&s;e Demi&s;e this Hou&s;e, as tho' it were deprived of a Parent, now lies in Mourning and in Sorrow: God grant that now, by my coming among you, it may in &s;ome mea&s;ure be refre&s;hed and comforted. To him nothing was wanting which indulgent Nature could be&s;tow, either to the propa|gating or Embelli&s;hment of Learning; no|thing
<PB N="39" REF="309">
which could excite either the Love or Admiration of tho&s;e over whom he pre&s;id|ed: What Per&s;picuity, what Strength of Thought, what a ready Utterance was he endowed with, applying him&s;elf to different Kinds of Learning, with Ea&s;e and Quick|ne&s;s! Never at a Lo&s;s, nor a Stranger to any Sort of Literature that was laid before him: What&s;oever he undertook in any Art, was performed to Exactne&s;s; &s;o that one might &s;ay, he was alone born for that Part which he then &s;u&s;tained, and that all his Time and Labour had been imployed there|in: Whether he followed more &s;erious Studies, or delighted him&s;elf with tho&s;e of le&s;s Con&s;equence; whether he treated of divine or moral Subjects, you could not per|ceive which he was more capable to per|form, this or that: But then, in his Ad|dre&s;s and Conver&s;ation, in his Rece&s;s and Bu&s;ine&s;s, how genteel was his Behaviour, how plain and open was his Mind! What Integrity in his Life, what Truth in his Words, what Mode&s;ty in his Countenance, what Gracefulne&s;s in his Front! Adorned with the&s;e Gifts of Nature, that which often &s;eems moro&s;e and &s;evere in ab&s;tra&s;e Learning, he was wont to allay, with a wonderful Plea&s;antne&s;s; &s;o that he could mould and form the Minds of young Be|ginners, not barely by his Precepts and In|&s;tructions,
<PB N="40" REF="310">
but by his A&s;pect and engaging Manner, to the Love of Learning and all the Prai&s;es of Humanity. In this Man were many Things admirable, many Things excellent, but nothing more &s;o, than that he held the Memory of ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Fell</HI> in &s;ingular Regard and Veneration, looking upon him, and declaring him to be the unerring Guide and Pattern of all his public Actions, the be&s;t Ma&s;ter for the In&s;truction and Govern|ment of Youth, a Re&s;torer of that Di&s;ci|pline which was interrupted among&s;t us in the Times of Di&s;traction; and, in a Word, the Guardian E&s;tabli&s;her of this &s;pacious Building: And, truly, ever &s;ince a Way was opened for the Return of true Religion and &s;ound Learning to this Place, from whence it was driven. What&s;oever this Hou&s;e hath contributed to the Help of Science, or the Increa&s;e of Piety; what&s;oever Benefit hath accrued from it to the Church or State, all flows from the Labour, Care, and Coun|&s;els of that mo&s;t holy Prelate: By him was laid the Foundation of our Prai&s;es; by him were &s;own the Seeds of Virtue, Indu&s;try and Learning, which even now flouri&s;h, and which from him, both living and dead, hath &s;o often ripened into a plenteous and joyful Harve&s;t.</P>
<P>As often, therefore, as I con&s;ider this Body &s;till flouri&s;hing by the In&s;tructions of
<PB N="41" REF="311">
<HI>Fell,</HI> methinks I &s;ee that well planted Field, which <HI>Cyrus</HI> formerly &s;hewed <HI>Ly&s;ander,</HI> where, if I may &s;ay &s;o, one might admire the Height, Ranks, and regular Di&s;po&s;i|tion of Trees, the Ground cultivated, &s;mooth and clean, with the &s;weet and flagrant Odor wafted from the Flowers, but above all, the Diligence and Indu&s;try of him by whom they were thus planted and de|&s;igned.</P>
<P>Happy that Hu&s;bandman of ours, who can truly &s;ay with <HI>Cyrus,</HI> All the&s;e have I thus di&s;po&s;ed, mine is the Order, the De|&s;ign is mine; many of the&s;e Trees have I al&s;o planted with my own Hands, for the Benefit of this, and, perhaps, of the coming Generation. To me therefore, in the Di&s;|charge of this Office (&s;hall I &s;ay it was a Happine&s;s or a Misfortune, immediately to &s;ucceed &s;uch eminent Men) what now re|mains, but that I, who am diffident of my own Abilities, &s;hould rou&s;e my&s;elf up by the Contemplation of tho&s;e Virtues with which they excelled, and that tho&s;e be&s;t of Ma&s;ters whom I profitted by, when living, I &s;hould copy after when dead, and look on them as Examples to be followed in all Things according to my Ability.</P>
<P>They truly, by their excellent Endow|ments obtained this, that they were &s;ingu|larly &s;erviceable to you, which I too well
<PB N="42" REF="312">
know I can never attain to. There is one Thing, however, which I boa&s;t to &s;hare in common with them. It is a certain un|&s;peakable Degree of Love and good Will, which I bear towards this Hou&s;e, by which I have at Heart, you and all your Intere&s;ts. In this I tru&s;t never to be out-done by any of tho&s;e my Ance&s;tors, with &s;ome of whom, in nothing el&s;e am I worthy to be com|pared.</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF Mr. <HI>Thomas Hearne.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THAT He, may never be forgotten, who has raked the Repo&s;itaries of Antiqui|ty, and been indefatigable in fetching Learning from Places where many would not have &s;ought after it; a few Memorials of his Life, and &s;ome Ob&s;ervations on his Writings, will, we hope, redound to his Credit.</P>
<P>In the Pari&s;h-Regi&s;ter of <HI>Abbots,</HI> or <HI>White-Waltham,</HI> a Village about &s;ix Miles
<PB N="2" REF="323">
di&s;tant from <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> it &s;tands upon Re|cord that he was baptized by the Name of <HI>Thomas,</HI> Son of <HI>George Hearne</HI> and <HI>Edith</HI> his Wife on the Eleventh of <HI>June,</HI> 1678. His Father, we have been in|formed, was a con&s;iderable Antiquary of the lower Cla&s;s; and was Sacri&s;tan of that Parochial Church to the Day of his Death. So that Mr. <HI>Hearne,</HI> in all pro|bability, received his great Propen&s;ity to the Study of Antiquity as it were <HI>ex Traduce.</HI></P>
<P>It is agreed on all Hands that his early Inclination to Letters fir&s;t di&s;covered it|&s;elf among the <HI>Tumuli</HI> of his own Pari&s;h Church-yard; over which he was ob&s;erved to be continually plodding lmo&s;t as &s;oon as he was Ma&s;ter of the Engli&s;h Alphabet. To this &s;oon after adding a little Wri|ting, he grew impatient after Antiquity: re&s;olved never to be unprepared for col|lecting Materials that might be &s;ervice|able hereafter, and accordingly &s;tuffed his Diary (which was his con&s;tant Compa|nion) with every Occurrence worthy his Notice. This he prudently fore&s;aw would turn to a good Account in his more ad|vanced Years; Vacancies in his future Labours might be &s;upplied with a Story from his Journal; and tho' it might not
<PB N="3" REF="324">
be very methodical, or perhaps not at all to his Purpo&s;e in Hand, yet the De&s;ign of pre&s;erving it might &s;ufficiently ju&s;tify its Publication.</P>
<P>This was the advantageous Method he pur&s;ued all his Life Time: He co|pied <HI>Monuments</HI> and <HI>In&s;criptions; Original Letters</HI> and <HI>venerable Ballads of Antiquity;</HI> Stories of hone&s;t <HI>John Ro&s;s</HI> and <HI>Peter Langtoft; Robert</HI> of <HI>Brune</HI> and St. <HI>Thomas Cantilupe:</HI> Men! who had not Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI> lived, might have lain for ever buried in an ignoble Ob&s;curity. The Pre&s;ervation of the&s;e Things may be a&s;cribed to his <HI>Col|lectanea</HI> which are now &s;welled to a pro|digious Size.</P>
<P>It is difficult indeed to determine to what particular Number the&s;e MSS Vo|lumes are now grown, becau&s;e they are kept with as &s;trict and &s;acred a Care from the Eyes of Mankind as the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. <HI>Prideaux</HI>'s Account of the&s;e choice <HI>Leaves</HI> in the 485 page of Vol. 2. of his <HI>Connection:</HI> where we find that none but the Keepers of them were ever &s;uffered to pe|ru&s;e them, and They only upon particular Exigencies.</NOTE> Oracles of the <HI>Sibylls</HI> depo&s;ited in the Capitol.

 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 29.</NOTE> Annals of <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Trokelowe.</HI> So that notwith&s;tanding there can be no certain Calculation made of an exact Number, yet there is &s;ome room for a Conjecture that they are not fewer than five Hun|dred.</P>
<P>Several Pa&s;&s;ages there are in his <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Rob. de Glouc.</HI> Vol. 2. p. 638.</BIBL></NOTE>XCV Volume which enough convince us of his not being then arrived at Years of Di&s;cre|tion, notwith&s;tanding he had filled &s;o ma|ny of them: If therefore his Indu&s;try was as great in his advanced Years as in his Youth (which we believe all will allow when they con&s;ider the uninterrupted State of Health he all along enjoyed) we think we may be allowed not to have ex|ceeded the Number, but rather to have fallen &s;hort of it. This however we only took Notice of to &s;hew what an <HI>ine&s;tima|ble</HI> Lo&s;s the World mu&s;t &s;u&s;tain, &s;hould this <HI>prodigious</HI> Trea&s;ure peri&s;h with its <HI>Collector.</HI></P>

<PB N="5" REF="326">
are told he laid the Foundation of his fu|ture Greatne&s;s.</P>

<P>A few Years being &s;pent in Academical Learning, by the Help of which he had improved his Propen&s;ity to Antiquity; He gave the World a Specimen of his fu|ture De&s;igns.

<P>It would be almo&s;t endle&s;s to expatiate particularly on his Labours, or to give an Account of the Product of every Year; for which Rea&s;on we mu&s;t refer the Reader to his own printed Catalogue of them, in&s;erted at the End of every Book, he publi&s;hed, &s;ince they became numerous.</P>
<P>During this Period however it is ob&s;er|vable that his <HI>Vindication</HI> of Tho&s;e who take the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Allegiance,</HI> was writ|ten, which loudly &s;peaks in the Behalf of Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI>'s Indu&s;try, and &s;hews the early Application he had made to Books.

<P>I &s;hould have mentioned indeed before this, the Encouragement he had from the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Hud&s;on</HI> Principal of St. <HI>Mary-Hall.</HI></NOTE>Head Librarian, who (acquainted with his Diligence) made him Underkeeper of the <HI>Bodleian</HI> Library.

<P>Thus have we con&s;idered one of his ex|cellent Qualities; the next is his <HI>Fidelity</HI> as an <HI>Editor.</HI></P>
<P>One Rule which we have been informed he at fir&s;t laid down, and generally &s;peak|ing clo&s;ely ob&s;erved, was always to fol|low his Authors religiou&s;ly. Their Mi&s;|takes by this means were punctually copied and &s;acredly pre&s;erved: Nay, the very Blunders of Tran&s;cribers were faith|fully penned down for the Amu&s;ement of Po&s;terity. <HI>Prurigo emendandi ac com|mutandi a Nobis plane ab&s;it,</HI> are his own Words in the Notes after the Appendix of <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Trokelowe</HI>'s Annals of <HI>Edward</HI> the Second.

<P>This Method is very ob&s;ervable through|out the numerous Volumes he has obliged the World with. <HI>Sic MS.</HI> he has noted perhaps in the <HI>Margin</HI> to &s;hew that he was not ignorant of the Error in the <HI>Copy.

<P>This Blunder may in &s;ome Mea&s;ure be accounted for in this Manner.&mdash;There is now in the <HI>Anatomy School</HI> (which was formerly under the Care of Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI>) a Stone found at <HI>Rewly,</HI> (probably the Foundation-Stone of a Chapel there) bear|ing this In&s;cription&mdash;ELE LONGESP COMIT: WAREW: HANC CAPELLAM FECIT: This no doubt had often been peru&s;ed by our <HI>Antiquary,</HI> as well as the other before mentioned; and perhaps the

<P>The&s;e few Mi&s;takes then having taken their Ri&s;e from not &s;ticking clo&s;ely to his <HI>Copy:</HI> we &s;hall take Notice of but One more, which was occa&s;ioned by following it too clo&s;ely; and it may be &s;een in his Edition of that valuable <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MS.

<P>Let it be ob&s;erved in the fir&s;t Place, that this MS. is in very old Capital Letters, and each Page divided into two Co|lumns: The fir&s;t contains the <HI>Latin,</HI> the <HI>Greek</HI> is wrote collaterally in the other. Thro' the <HI>O&s;citancy</HI> of the Scribe, the <HI>Latin</HI> Sentence is frequently carried be|yond the Bounds of its own Column, by which means it becomes intermixed with the <HI>Greek.</HI> The Text as he has printed it &s;tands thus: <HI>viz.</HI>

At the Bottom of his Page (not contented
<PB N="31" REF="352">
with Dr. <HI>Mills</HI>'s <HI>Reading.</HI>) he adds <HI>&s;ic plane in Codice no&s;tro non</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>ut a|pud Millium;</HI> tho' it will appear beyond all Di&s;pute upon any one's Enquiry, that the Doctor was not in the lea&s;t to be blamed. For, as we ob&s;erved before, thro' the Care|le&s;sne&s;s of the Scribe, the Latin Line be+ing carried beyond its due Bounds into the Greek Column, and the Words MENTE and MEN TE con&s;i&s;ting of five Capital Let|ters, ju&s;t the &s;ame in both Languages, un|happily led Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI> into this Mi&s;take. So that by defalcating one Word from the Latin, and converting it into two Greek ones of no Signification at all, he &s;poiled the Sen&s;e of the one, and made the other quite &s;uperfluous.&mdash;But &s;ome Faults &s;ure are pardonable in &s;o <HI>voluminous</HI> a Writer.</P>
<P>To be particular in &s;hewing his Talent at <HI>Rea&s;oning</HI> would, we fear, be making too free with our <HI>Reader</HI>'s Time: We might quote three Parts of his Di&s;cour&s;e on the <HI>Stunsfield Pavement,</HI> had not Mr. <HI>Peyntr</HI> thoroughly con&s;idered it already; and give &s;uch In&s;tances of it which nothing but <HI>Envy</HI> or <HI>Ill-Nature</HI> could find Fault with: But the following <HI>Epi&s;tle</HI> prevents our dwelling upon this Excellency, it being a Ma&s;ter-piece of its kind, and what the Reader, we hope, will be greatly delighted with.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="353">
But let the Epi&s;tle &s;peak for it&s;elf: There is one Paragraph in his <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pag. 28, 29.</NOTE>Preface to <HI>Sprott</HI>'s <HI>Chronicle,</HI> which really &s;eems to be a new Method of <HI>Rea&s;oning,</HI> &s;uch as no Writer but him&s;elf, we believe, dares lay any Claim to. He is there &s;peaking in <HI>Sprott</HI>'s Prai&s;e, and his Words are the&s;e&mdash;<Q REND="inline"><HI>Adeo ut non videam cur mihi &s;it Detri|mento, &s;i publice declarem me opinari de A|cademia no&s;tra Oxonien&s;i Opus etiam ju&s;tum ac di&s;tinctum contexui&s;&s;e:</HI></Q> And then comes the Rea&s;on in the very next Sentence, viz. <Q REND="inline"><HI>Opinioni favet Auctoris Pietas.

<P>This is the Argument produced to prove that the Author of that <HI>lean Chro|nicle</HI> (whether <HI>Sprott</HI> or &s;ome other) it not clearly appearing that <HI>Sprott</HI> was the Au|thor of it, compo&s;ed many other valuable Books, not at all inferior to the <HI>Chronicle</HI> which is publi&s;hed.

in Ob&s;curity; and doubtle&s;s was there not &s;ome Hope of their being &s;till recoverable, <HI>Sprott</HI>'s Admirers (how in|flexible &s;oever in other Ca&s;es) would la|ment greatly under their Lo&s;s in this.</P>
<P>Agreeable to this new Method of Rea|&s;oning we find an uncommon Conjecture in his Preface to the Sixth Volume of <HI>Le|land</HI>'s <HI>Itinerary,</HI> which very few Writers would ever have made. From a Medal of <HI>Carau&s;ius</HI> bearing this In&s;cription, VICTORIA CEA, he endeavours to prove, that the Brogue of the common People is the true Standard of the <HI>Roman</HI> Dialect and Pronunciation. The Word <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> ac|cording to this <HI>curious Remark,</HI> is not to be pronounced as it generally is by People of Fa&s;hion and Breeding, <HI>Ce&s;ar,</HI> but a|greeable to the broad Manner of &s;peak|ing u&s;ed by the mo&s;t ru&s;tic of Mankind, and as it &s;tands upon the Coin, CEASAR.</P>
<P>We acknowledge the Ob&s;ervation to be a very curious one, and to &s;tand upon the Authority of a Medal, but if it &s;hould ever be di&s;covered, that it proceeded from an Error of the <HI>Mint-Ma&s;ter,</HI> from a &s;imple Literal Tran&s;po&s;ition, or from any other Accident (as po&s;&s;ibly it might) the Re|mark will then &s;ink into its Value; The

Coin indeed may be curious upon the Ac|count of the Blunder, but is no more an Argument to a&s;certain the Truth of Dia|lect or Pronunciation, than that <HI>&s;purious Halfpenny</HI> of his pre&s;ent <HI>Maje&s;ty,</HI> would be a Standard in the next Age for pro|nouncing GEOGIVS in&s;tead of GEORGIVS.</P>
<P>It would wa&s;te too much of the Reader's Time probably, to offer here a Collection of all the Poetical Fragments &s;cattered thro' his Labours; the Pre&s;ervation of which by Printing them, we mu&s;t ob|&s;erve, &s;hews no &s;mall De&s;ire to be u&s;eful to Mankind, as the&s;e Rhythmes contain either Le&s;&s;ons of Oeconomy; &s;uch as,<Q><L>With a red Man reade thy read;</L>

Now Sir, tho' I &s;hould be as far from interrupting the indefatigable Labours of Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI> in his Hi&s;torical Studies as any Man living; yet I think no Man ought to be indefatigable in Slander, and that the Unchri&s;tian Temper he has &s;hewn ought to be reprehended. And it gives me no &s;mall Concern to find the grave Style of an Antiquarian changed to the foul-mouthed Language of the mo&s;t aban|doned Pro&s;titute. Neither can I by any means agree, that whatever <HI>unguarded Expre&s;&s;ions</HI> Mr. <HI>Moyle</HI> may have dropt, can be ju&s;t Grounds of Provocation for &s;uch Scurrility, as I believe never before fell from the Pen of any Controverti&s;t.

<P>As to the <HI>Critical Di&s;pute,</HI> I &s;hall be as &s;ilent as I re&s;olve to be about the <HI>Legendary one</HI> above mentioned.

But at the &s;ame time, all, who knew him, will allow that Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Character of a certain Peer, in <HI>Ab&s;alom</HI> and <HI>Achitophel,</HI> too much re|&s;embled Mr. <HI>Dodwell;</HI> for he truly was, what the Poet a&s;&s;erts,

<L>Was every thing by &s;tarts and nothing long.</L></Q>
The Fir&s;t Book I ever printed was the pre&s;ent of a Manu&s;cript he made me, in Defence of his, now &s;ufficiently exploded, Doctrine of the <HI>Divine Imortalizing Spirit transfu&s;ed by Bapti&s;m</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An <HI>Explication</HI> of a <HI>famous Pa&s;&s;age</HI> in the Dialogue of St. <HI>Ju&s;tin Martyr</HI> with <HI>Tryphon,</HI> concerning the <HI>Immortality</HI> of <HI>Human Souls,</HI> &amp;c. 8vo. printed in the Year 1708, price 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI></NOTE>.

<P>Now &s;ince your Brea&s;t is animated with &s;o much Heat in behalf of the&s;e <HI>Venerabi|lia,</HI> the <HI>Fathers,</HI> I de&s;ire to know by what better Authority, than a <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Canoniza|tion, are they inve&s;ted with the Epithet of <HI>Holy?</HI> If indeed, all the <HI>Libertini&s;m</HI> of <HI>Youth</HI> be &s;ufficient to confer that Title, and all the <HI>Impotence</HI> of <HI>Age,</HI> be &s;ufficient to confirm it, the Plea is good, and the Precedents produced may be St. <HI>Augu&s;tine,</HI> St. <HI>Origen,</HI> and that notorious Saint, of <HI>Creed-making</HI> Memory, St. <HI>Athana&s;ius.</HI> Who in their Works may &s;ay of each o|ther&mdash;

<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>_ONE mu&s;t have but little Know|ledge of human Nature, not to be &s;en&s;ible of that Curio&s;ity which prompts Mankind to be acquainted with the Hi&s;tory of Per&s;ons di&s;tingui&s;hed by their extraordinary Vir|tues and Qualifications, and who have experienced many uncommon Varieties of Life. In reading their Tran&s;actions, we become agreeably intimate with the Characters which have rai&s;ed our Admi|ration; we attend them in the different Scenes thro' which they pa&s;s, and are &s;en&s;ible of a &s;ecret Longing to imitate the &s;hining Parts of their Conduct: They frequently teach us an ea&s;y Moderation in Pro&s;perity, and are no le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful in reconciling us to the &s;evere Di&s;pen&s;a|tion of Providence.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="390">
THE Impre&s;&s;ions we receive from per|&s;onal Characters, are more lively and affecting than &s;uch as are imparted to us by moral Precepts; and tho&s;e Virtues, which In&s;titutions of Philo&s;ophy might give us but a languid Invitation to imi|tate, are altogether irre&s;i&s;table, when they are &s;et off by the Conduct of Per&s;ons of Elevation; and they mu&s;t be thrown into Action, in order to give them their la&s;t Poli&s;h and Refinement.</P>
<P>THIS may be one Rea&s;on why Bio|graphy has generally met with &s;uch a fa|vourable Reception, and we may venture to affirm, that if the Authors who engage in this Kind of Writing, would &s;elect &s;uch Characters as are entertaining, and in&s;tructive at the &s;ame Time, they would have no Cau&s;e to complain of any Di&s;|regard from the Public.</P>
<P>THE noble Lady, who is the Sub|ject of the following Memoirs, has made &s;o con&s;picuous and engaging a Figure, thro' the &s;eries and Vici&s;&s;itudes of a long Life, that &s;he may be ju&s;tly reputed an Honour to her own Sex, as
<PB N="3" REF="391">
&s;he has always been the Admiration of ours.</P>
<P>IF a De&s;cent from an illu&s;trious Race of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nobility, a polite and generous Education, an early Familiarity with the mo&s;t amiable Accompli&s;hments, an inchanting Harmony of Per&s;on and Mind, a Virgin Purity of Youth, and a taintle&s;s Fidelity of conjugal Life, have any Charms in the &s;ofter Sex, they have all lent their full Lu&s;tre to the late Dutche&s;s of <HI>ORMONDE.</HI></P>
<P>IT &s;hould &s;eem as if Providence intend|ed to guard this Lady from every Impu|tation that could be formed again&s;t her by envious and detracting Minds, and therefore would not confine her Virtues to Scenes of Satisfaction and Pro&s;perity; &s;he had long convinced the World of her Ability to act an unexceptionable Part in &s;uch a Situation, but &s;omething &s;till remained to give her Conduct its full Perfection. The appointed Period ar|rived; this incomparable Per&s;on was de|prived of the deare&s;t of all her Enjoy|ments: She &s;aw her&s;elf for ever &s;epa|rated from her darling Con&s;ort, and her former Affluence contracted into a very
<PB N="4" REF="392">
moderate Limitation: Her Sun&s;hine of Happine&s;s darkened with Adver&s;ity; but that Adver&s;ity only gave her an Oppor|tunity of charming all who knew her, by her inimitable Re&s;ignation to the Decrees of Heaven.</P>
<P>AS there was Rea&s;on to believe the Public would be curious to know the Particulars of a Life &s;o diver&s;ified by &s;uch unu&s;ual Events, all po&s;&s;ible Care has been taken to collect every authen|tic Circum&s;tance that could make &s;uch a Relation u&s;eful and entertaining; and, we pre&s;ume, that the Impartiality with which we have proceeded, on this Oc|cation, will intitle this Performance to a candid Reception from tho&s;e who are plea&s;ed to favour it with their Peru&s;al.</P>

Animated by this Per&s;ua&s;ion, they were particularly care|ful to cultivate, by a &s;uitable Education, the Virtues which had already &s;prung up in her Mind with &s;uch a luxuriant Bloom. Their Cares &s;ucceeded to their Wi&s;h, and there was no Accompli&s;hment nece&s;|&s;ary to give Perfection to her Sex, but what appeared with all its Charms in the Conduct of this young Lady.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="395">
NATURE &s;ometimes pre&s;ents us with a great deal of Inequality in her Produc|tions; and it is no uncommon Thing to &s;ee a very di&s;agreeable Exterior allotted to a fini&s;hed Mind; but &s;he now determined to be uniform in her Operations, and prepared, for the Duke of <HI>Beaufort</HI>'s Daughter, a Form as amiable, as the Soul which was to claim it, for her Habi|tation.</P>
<P>IT would require a Pen, much more ma&s;terly in De&s;cription than mine, to give the Reader a competent Idea of this engaging Lady; the inchanting Harmo|ny of her Shape, the Lu&s;tre and Viva|city of her Eyes, which in&s;pired all who beheld them with unutterable Impre&s;&s;ions; the glowing Blu&s;h of the Ro&s;e, which was blended in her Cheeks with the Virgin Purity of the Lilly, the flowing Shade of Hair which wantoned in a Profu&s;ion of Ringlets, that no Pencil could imitate; the delicate Turn of her Face, and the bewitching Softne&s;s which diffu&s;ed it&s;elf thro' every Feature; the panting Snow of her Bo&s;om, and the taper Whitene&s;s of her Arms; with a thou&s;and other Beauties which perpetually played around her, formed &s;uch an A&s;&s;emblage of Perfection,
<PB N="8" REF="396">
that was to be re&s;i&s;ted by nothing but In&s;en&s;ibility it&s;elf.</P>
<P>WE believe we &s;hall not be taxed with Fal&s;hood, when we affirm, that &s;uch a Prodigality of Charms were capable, without any other A&s;&s;i&s;tance, of capti|vating a thou&s;and Hearts; but we have already intimated that Nature di&s;carded all Partiality in her Plan, and made this irre&s;i&s;table Form the Re&s;idence of a Soul which was altogether as attractive as its lovely Man&s;ion: The mo&s;t refined Poig|nancy of her Wit was contra&s;ted by the &s;edate&s;t Judgment; and each of the&s;e fine Qualifications were &s;o beautifully &s;oftened by her native Sweetne&s;s of Tem|per, that her Plea&s;antry never gave Pain, and none ever thought them&s;elves in&s;ult|ed by her &s;uperior Penetration.</P>
<P>THE Happine&s;s of her Memory facili|tated her Improvement, by tho&s;e Books and Indu&s;try, with which &s;he was daily conver&s;ant; and, in a few Years, it proved &s;uch a Trea&s;ury of Knowledge and Po|litene&s;s, as few Ladies of her Age were ever enriched with: The little Levities of the Sex, and tho&s;e refined Deviations from Sincerity and Sanctity of Manners, which are become &s;o fa&s;hionable a Part
<PB N="9" REF="397">
of modern Education were altogether un|known to her. True Virtue is certainly amiable in her&s;elf, but &s;he puts on re|doubled Charms when &s;he &s;hines in the Conduct of a blooming Virgin.</P>
<P>SUCH was the Lady we are de&s;crib|ing; her Mind was as immaculate as her Face, and every Year that added to her Youth, pre&s;ented her with new Perfec|tions, and awaken'd a general Curio&s;ity to know what happy Man was to be ble&s;s'd with the Endearments of her nup|tial Love.</P>
<P>IT is not to be imagined in what Manner that plea&s;ing Expectation influ|enced &s;ome of the noble&s;t of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Youth. A virtuous young Lady of Rank and Beauty is a publick Ble&s;&s;ing, &s;he civi|lizes the Souls of her Admirers more than all their Academical In&s;titutions, and fires them to aim at a proper Simili|tude of Accompli&s;hments. Innocence, Purity and Honour appear &s;o per&s;ua&s;ive in the Fair-One, that it is no Wonder if &s;he daily increa&s;es the Number of their Votaries, and brings them fre&s;h Acce&s;|&s;ions of Homage.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="398">
AMONGST the &s;hining Crouds of Adorers who wi&s;hed to in&s;pire her with the &s;oft Sen&s;ibility of Love, none made &s;o con&s;picuous a Figure as the Duke of <HI>Ormonde;</HI> he was de&s;cended from a very antient and illu&s;trious Family that had given many Heroes to their Country, and, in the Per&s;on of the Duke, had pre|&s;ented it with an Ornament that did not a little contribute to its Lu&s;tre. Death had for &s;ome Time deprived him of his fir&s;t Lady (who was the elde&s;t Daughter of the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI>) and left him a Widower in the full Bloom of his Youth. His endear|ing Behaviour to his decea&s;ed Dutche&s;s, warmed many of the faire&s;t with &s;ecret Wi&s;hes to &s;ucceed her in his Embraces. His Per&s;on was &s;uch as might impart the &s;ofte&s;t Impre&s;&s;ions to the cha&s;te&s;t Heart, and was &s;et off by &s;uch a winning Singu|larity of Sweetne&s;s, Genero&s;ity, and eve|ry other Quality which con&s;titutes the fine Gentleman, that it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for him to be long con&s;idered with In|difference by any Lady to whom he breathed his Pa&s;&s;ion. We may add to this, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch a Princely E&s;tate, that Fortune &s;eemed to contend with Nature which of them &s;hould be his greate&s;t Benefactor. It is true, the Duke
<PB N="11" REF="399">
only valued the Favours of the former, as they enabled him to di&s;tingui&s;h him|&s;elf by numberle&s;s Acts of Humanity, and indulged him in his natural Propen|&s;ity to Benevolence. And if the Godde&s;s has not of late been &s;o liberal to many others, it may have proceeded from their being de&s;titute of his Inclinations to com|municate her Bounties to their Fellow Creatures.</P>
<P>AFTER the Account I have attempt|ed to give of the&s;e two illu&s;trious Per|&s;ons, it will be natural to conclude, that they were formed for each other; and therefore, without entering into the Par|ticulars of that tender Intercour&s;e which Love, and a Similitude of Di&s;po&s;itions, e&s;tabli&s;hed between them, it will be &s;uffi|cient if we acquaint the Reader, that his Grace was &s;o fortunate in his Addre&s;&s;es, as to prevail on the Duke of <HI>Beaufort</HI>'s charming Daughter to con&s;ent to be the lovelie&s;t Bride in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>THE Number of the young Dutche&s;s's Admirers was not dimini&s;hed by her Mar|riage, and tho' they found them&s;elves re|&s;trained from di&s;clo&s;ing to her the Senti|ments with which her Charms had in|&s;pired them, yet there were &s;everal who
<GAP DESC="missing" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 pages">
<PB N="14" REF="400">
merited that Friend&s;hip by a Number of amiable Qualities.</P>
<P>IT often happens, that Men of Wit, thro' too much Partiality to them&s;elves, are apt to fancy that a Lady's Satisfac|tion in their Conver&s;ation, mu&s;t create a Fondne&s;s for their Per&s;ons, and the Earl did not fail to impute to the Dutche&s;s, Impre&s;&s;ions in his Favour, which &s;he her|&s;elf was never &s;en&s;ible of; and con&s;e|quently he was always ready to improve every In&s;tance of her Complacency too much to his own Advantage. The Opinion he entertained of his being more agreea|ble to her than he really was, made him look on the di&s;honourable Conduct he was meditating again&s;t the Duke, as a Crime that was capable of a very ea&s;y Vindication, he thought it more hon|ourable to &s;ucceed with the Dutche&s;s, than to pre&s;erve Fidelity in his Friend|&s;hip to her Lord; and to &s;uch an Infa|tuation was he hurried by his guilty Love, that he imagined it to be the mo&s;t criminal Action in the World to neglect the Happine&s;s which his Vanity repre|&s;ented the Dutche&s;s inclinable to afford him.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="401">
IN Con&s;equence of this Per&s;ua&s;ion, as he had the Honour one Evening to lead her Grace from the Drawing Room, he &s;lipt a Letter into her Hand, as &s;he was &s;tepping into her Coach, and then retired with a profound Reverence. The Lady believed the Paper contained &s;ome agreeable Piece of Poetry, in which the Earl, as we intimated before, was very happy, and was impatient to read this new Product of his Capacity: But who can de&s;cribe her Confu&s;ion and Re&s;ent|ment, when &s;he found it to be a Decla|ration of Love, and her Di&s;plea&s;ure was the greater, as &s;he was con&s;cious that no Part of her Conduct could po&s;&s;ibly give that Nobleman any Pretentions to the indecent Pre&s;umption with which he treated her; and tho' it was late at Night, &s;he re&s;olved to acquaint the Dutche&s;s her Mother with the Affront that had been offered to her Virtue.</P>
<P>SHE accordingly ordered her Coach|man to drive to the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Beau|fort</HI>'s Hou&s;e, and, at her Arrival there, went into her Grace's Bed-Chamber, and intreated her, with a Flood of Tears, to read the Letter &s;he put into her Hands. The Dutche&s;s was not a little &s;urprized

to &s;ee her Daughter in a Di&s;order of Mind intirely new to her, and immedi|ately read over the Letter, with an A&s;to|ni&s;hment natural to &s;uch an Event. <Q REND="inline"><HI>Is it po&s;&s;ible, Madam,</HI> &s;aid the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Ormonde, that any Man can dare to think he has a Privilege to treat me in this di&s;|honourable Manner! I can appeal to Hea|ven and Earth, that my Conduct has hither|to been without Reproach, which makes this Violation of the Re&s;pect due to me, &s;o in&s;upportable.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE Dutche&s;s of <HI>Beaufort</HI> was as much di&s;&s;atisfied with this Adventure, as her Daughter, and was ju&s;tly apprehen|&s;ive that it might be attended with very fatal Con&s;equences; to prevent which, all imaginable Di&s;cretion was nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>WHILST they were deliberating what Steps were mo&s;t proper to be taken in &s;o delicate an Affair, a Lady of great Quality, and a near Relation to them both, came in very &s;ea&s;onably to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the Con&s;ultation; and after &s;he had heard a particular Account of the whole Affair, &s;he gave it as her Opinion, that <Q REND="inline"><HI>it would be mo&s;t proper for the Dutche&s;s of</HI> Ormonde <HI>to di&s;&s;emble her Re&s;entment, and treat the amorous Peer with &s;uch an</HI><PB N="17" REF="405">
<HI>Air of Indifference, as would effectually mortify his Vanity, and di&s;courage him from per&s;i&s;ting in his criminal De&s;ires:</HI> The Lady added, <HI>that if &s;uch a Cour&s;e of Behaviour &s;hould not have the Effect that might be rea&s;onably expected, &s;he would undertake to di&s;clo&s;e the Affair to the Duke of</HI> Ormonde, <HI>in &s;uch a Light as &s;hould en|gage him to come into a Scheme &s;he had formed for making this new Lover the Di|ver&s;ion of the whole Town.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THIS Advice was allowed to be ju&s;t, and, after &s;ome farther Con&s;ideration, the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Ormonde</HI> took her Leave, with a Determination to conduct her&s;elf according to her Relations Sentiments. It was not long before the young Earl &s;aw her, and, as he was plea&s;ed to flat|ter him&s;elf, that the Graces of his Wit and Per&s;on were irre&s;i&s;table, he was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed at the negligent Man|ner in which the Dutche&s;s heard all the fine Things he &s;aid to her; and as he found that he had not made the lea&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion on her Heart, he began to imagine &s;he might po&s;&s;ibly not have read his Letter, for he could not believe that &s;o much premeditated Wit and Tenderne&s;s as it contained, could prove ineffectual; and therefore re&s;olved to be certain that
<PB N="18" REF="406">
his next Letter &s;hould be read by the Dutche&s;s; for which Purpo&s;e, he found Means to gain, as he imagined, one of her Women to his Intere&s;t; he made her a Pre&s;ent of a large Pur&s;e of Gold, ac|companying it with a &s;econd Billet, which he intreated her to deliver into her La|dy's Hands, and, at the &s;ame Time, gave her to under&s;tand, that if &s;he ac|quitted her&s;elf of the Confidence he re|po&s;ed in her, to his Satisfaction, there was nothing &s;he might not promi&s;e her|&s;elf from his future Bounty.</P>
<P>THE Dutche&s;s's Woman performed her Commi&s;&s;ion, and gave the Letter to her Lady, with a particular Account of the Earl's Liberality, and all the large Promi&s;es he had made her. The Dutch|e&s;s, after &s;he had read the Letter, made her Mother, and the other Lady, who had in&s;tructed her how to behave, acquainted with the Contents; upon which they thought it now a proper Time to make the Duke of <HI>Ormonde</HI> privy to the Secret. This they did, in &s;uch a Manner as ea|&s;ily di&s;po&s;ed his Grace to come into their Mea&s;ures, to make his Rival as ridicu|lous as his Vanity ought to render him. To accompli&s;h which, it was agreed a|mong them, that the Dutche&s;s &s;hould an|&s;wer

her Lover's Letter, and it is ea&s;y to imagine, that an Epi&s;tle dictated by &s;uch Per&s;ons, and on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion, was artful enough to deceive, even a Gen|tleman of the Earl's Penetration. It would be no di&s;agreeable Entertainment to the Reader, could I repeat all the plea|&s;ant Things, and the diverting Contri|vances that were invented by this illu|&s;trious Company, to expo&s;e the pre&s;um|ing Lover. The Dutche&s;s of <HI>Ormonde</HI> was for having him <Q REND="inline"><HI>privately admitted in|to the Hou&s;e, and &s;hut up in &s;ome Place where he might be half frozen, before he &s;hould be &s;et at Liberty:</HI></Q> But the Duke replied, <Q REND="inline"><HI>That would be a Management of too low a Turn for the Earl's nice and de|licate Ta&s;te,</HI></Q> and then recollecting, that his Garden Wall was of a very conveni|ent Heighth, he thought it would be be&s;t <Q REND="inline"><HI>for the Lover to climb over it, in order to come to his Lady, the Danger and Diffi|culty only tending to compleat the Glory of &s;uch a gallant Adventure; be&s;ides,</HI> added he, <HI>we &s;hall by this Means &s;ee whether his Lord&s;hip is in earne&s;t, and dare ha|zard his fine Per&s;on in the Pro&s;ecution of his Amour.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THIS Propo&s;al meeting with the Ap|probation of all the Ladies, they went
<PB N="20" REF="408">
into the Garden to examine the Wall, and, ob&s;erving a Place that had Hooks, which a Ladder might be commodiou&s;ly fa&s;tened to, the Dutche&s;s's Woman had Directions to de&s;cribe this convenient Situation to the Earl; but it was not done till &s;everal Letters had pa&s;&s;ed be|tween him and the Dutche&s;s, and he be|came per&s;uaded, that his Addre&s;&s;es were as &s;ucce&s;sful as he could wi&s;h. And now the Dutche&s;s's Woman acquainted him, <Q REND="inline"><HI>he had made all imaginable Impre&s;&s;ions on her Lady, and that &s;he expected the Plea|&s;ure of his Company with the greate&s;t Im|patience, but then,</HI> continued &s;he, <HI>it will be impo&s;&s;ible for your Lord&s;hip to pa&s;s by the Porter in any Di&s;gui&s;e; and you are not in&s;en&s;ible what Regard is due to a Lady's Reputation, in an Affair of this Nature, and therefore &s;ome Expedient mu&s;t be thought of, to prevent any Di&s;covery of your being admitted into my Lady's Apart|ment.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE Earl, upon this, gave her the &s;tronge&s;t A&s;&s;urances of his &s;trict Regard for the Dutche&s;s's Honour; <Q REND="inline"><HI>and there|fore,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I am de&s;irous of being intro|duced in any Manner you can contrive, to prevent my being di&s;covered by any of the Servants, and there is no Danger, that I</HI>

<HI>will ever decline to accompli&s;h my Happi|ne&s;s, with all the Privacy my lovely Dutch|e&s;s can po&s;&s;ibly de&s;ire.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE Gentlewoman finding him in &s;uch a Re&s;olution, thought it then pro|per to acquaint him, <Q REND="inline"><HI>That no Way would be more effectual, to prevent the Affair from being detected, than for his Lord&s;hip to climb over the Garden-Wall,</HI></Q> and then &s;he de&s;cribed that particular Part of it, where the Hooks were fa&s;tened; <Q REND="inline"><HI>your Lord&s;hip,</HI> added &s;he, <HI>is too gallant, to he&s;itate at a|ny little Danger that you may be expo&s;ed to, on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion, and you are like|wi&s;e to con&s;ider, that you could not have a more favourable Opportunity of convinc|ing my Lady, that your Pa&s;&s;ion for her, can make you de&s;pi&s;e every Hazard and Diffi|culty that may lie between you and the Happine&s;s you are in Pur&s;uit of, and there|fore, if your Lord&s;hip has no Objection to what I have been propo&s;ing, I will be, at Eleven this Night, in the Garden to re|ceive you.</HI></Q></P>
<P>HIS Lord&s;hip was &s;o animated, with the Hopes of his imagined Joys, that he told the Gentlewoman, in a Kind of Tran&s;port, <Q REND="inline"><HI>That he thought Fortune was very propitious to him, in giving him &s;uch</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="410">
<HI>an Opportunity of convincing her Lady how much his Pa&s;&s;ion could &s;urmount eve|ry Danger and Impediment;</HI></Q> upon which he took his Leave, with a &s;olemn Pro|mi&s;e to be punctual to the appointed Time; and then went to pay a Vi&s;it to the Duke of <HI>Ormonde,</HI> by whom, as was before ob&s;erved, he was treated with the greate&s;t Friend&s;hip and Intimacy.</P>
<P>THE Duke received him with his u&s;ual Affability, and after &s;ome Conver|&s;ation, walked with him in his Garden, where he could not forbear &s;miling to him&s;elf, to ob&s;erve, with what a curious Eye his Vi&s;itor examined rhe Wall he was to &s;cale that Evening. After they had taken a few Turns, the Earl took his Leave, and went to his own Hou&s;e, where he pa&s;&s;ed the Remainder of the Day with all the impatient De&s;ires, natural to a Lover, who expects the happy Period of all his Wi&s;hes. The appointed Hour was, at la&s;t, come, and his Lord&s;hip did not fail to be exactly punctual at the Place agreed on, where he found the Ladder of Ropes thrown over the Wall, by the Means of which he mounted to the Top, with wonderful Activity, and from thence, as nimbly de&s;cended into the Garden: But, alas! how frequently
<PB N="23" REF="411">
do Di&s;appointments and Di&s;grace attend the fine&s;t Schemes of poor Mortals; and how common is it for Men to meet with the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable Accidents, in the very In&s;tant that he promi&s;ed him|&s;elf nothing but Rapture, and the mo&s;t perfect Felicity! The adventrous Peer had no &s;ooner &s;et Foot on the fatal Ground, than the Gardener, who hap|pened to be a very &s;turdy Fellow, pre|tending to mi&s;take him for a Per&s;on who intended to rob the Hou&s;e, fell upon him with Herculean Force, and gave him &s;uch a vigorous Drubbing, that he was ob|liged to cry out for A&s;&s;i&s;tance. The Noi&s;e alarmed the Hou&s;e, and the Duke, with all the Company, who were then at Supper with him, came out in a &s;eeming Surpri&s;e to know the Occa&s;ion of the Clamours they heard. Any one will ima|gine, that the unfortunate Lover made no very graceful Figure in &s;uch a Con|juncture; and, as it was impo&s;&s;ible for the Spectators of his Di&s;grace, to keep their Countenances, he grew &s;en&s;ible, that this had been a premeditated Scheme to expo&s;e him. But, as he had a peculi|ar Pre&s;ence of Mind, and was, likewi&s;e, one of tho&s;e Philo&s;ophic Lovers, who never run di&s;tracted at the Di&s;appoinment of their Pa&s;&s;ion, he asked the Duke's
<PB N="24" REF="412">
Pardon for the Folly he had committed, de&s;iring his Grace to impute it to a youthful Incon&s;ideration he would no longer indulge; after which, he joined with the Company in their Mirth, and rallied him&s;elf very plea&s;antly for the Di&s;cipline he had received from the ho|ne&s;t Gardiner.</P>
<P>THE Earl's ill Succe&s;s in his Amour, &s;oon became public, and was, for a con&s;iderable Time, the Entertainment of all the gay Company about the Court; and be&s;ides this, it entirely extingui&s;hed the Hopes of all who &s;ighed for the amiable Dutche&s;s in Secret. They were convinced, that her Vertue was impreg|nable, and that it was po&s;&s;ible for a La|dy to be the faire&s;t of her Sex, and, at the &s;ame Time, capable of pre&s;erving an untainted Fidelity to her Nuptial Vow.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The foregoing was an Adventure of the late Duke of <HI>Buckingham&s;hire</HI> when he was Earl of <HI>Mulgrave.</HI></NOTE></P>

I &s;ay, the En|vy, becau&s;e there have been People ma|licious enough to declare, that the Dutche&s;s, &s;ome time after her Marriage, entertained &s;uch a Fondne&s;s for Cards, as in a great Mea&s;ure alienated the Duke's Affection from her for a con&s;iderable Time. But whil&s;t &s;ome have been &s;o ungenerous as to propagate &s;uch a Re|port, and others &s;o weak as to believe it, all mu&s;t acknowledge this to be the only Frailty that was ever imputed to that Lady, and even this has been aggravated much beyond the Reality of the Fact. The Truth is, Cards being at that Time, as well as now, the fa&s;hionable Amu&s;ement of the Fair, it was impo&s;&s;i|ble for the Dutche&s;s, who&s;e Hou&s;e was continually filled with the be&s;t Company in the Kingdom, to do otherwi&s;e than comply with the Inclinations of her Vi|&s;itors in that Diver&s;ion; and it may be true, that &s;he might &s;ometimes &s;it up late at Play to oblige her Company, and we will not deny, that the Duke might be &s;en&s;ible of &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s to find his Lady compelled by the reigning Deco|rum among the Great, to be ab&s;ent more Hours from him, than were agreeable to her Inclinations. But, at the &s;ame Time, in Ju&s;tice to the Memory of that incom|parable

Lady, we mu&s;t affirm, That the Moment &s;he was &s;en&s;ible of the lea&s;t Unea&s;ine&s;s in her Lord on that Account, &s;he never after would &s;uffer Play to de|tain her from him, to any late or un|&s;ea&s;onable Hour.

<L>The Land, if not re&s;train'd, had met your Way,</L>
