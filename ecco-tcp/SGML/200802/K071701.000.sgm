<HEAD>HEADS OF Mr. FRANCIS's SPEECH, ON THE 7TH OF MAY, 1793.</HEAD>
<P>MR. FRANCIS &s;aid, Mr. Speaker, I cannot but congratulate the friends of Parliamentary Reform, and the country in general, on the au&s;picious open|ing of this debate. The three gentlemen, who have &s;poken fir&s;t this day, Members of Parliament as re|&s;pectable in point of character and &s;ituation as any who &s;it here, and totally unconnected with any of the parties, by whom the pre&s;ent motion is &s;upport|ed, have declared them&s;elves &s;trongly, though gene|rally, friends to the mea&s;ure. I receive the decla|rations they have &s;o honourably made, as a pledge of their principles, and an omen of &s;ucce&s;s. The
<PB N="4" REF="3">
two fir&s;t of the&s;e gentlemen have doubts about the time. They think we ought to wait for a more fa|vourable opportunity, when they &s;hall be ready to concur with us. Undoubtedly it is for <HI>them</HI> to judge at what period they will act. I wi&s;h them only to recollect that, when this mea&s;ure was introduced la&s;t year we were at peace with all the world, and the country was allowed to be in flouri&s;hing circum|&s;tances. The que&s;tion put to us then was, why are you not &s;atisfied with the advantages you enjoy? Why &s;hould you wi&s;h to change or improve when all is well, and when apparently the people are con|tented? That argument will not do now; but the enemies of reform have another in readine&s;s to &s;erve their pre&s;ent turn. They have clothes for all &s;ea|&s;ons. Since la&s;t year, the &s;tate of the kingdom is completely rever&s;ed. We are involved in a foreign war, and this war is attended already with uncom|mon dome&s;tic calamities. <HI>Is this a time to think of changes in the Con&s;titution?</HI> for &s;o they are plea&s;ed to call every mea&s;ure that propo&s;es to correct abu&s;es, by reverting to principles. <HI>Is this a time to di&s;turb or agitate the minds of the people, or to weaken the hands of Government?</HI> The&s;e gro&s;s contradictions ought to defeat one another. It is not fair to &s;uffer &s;uch ho&s;tile and incon&s;i&s;tent arguments to act in concert, as they do, again&s;t one and the &s;ame mea|&s;ure. With re&s;pect to times and &s;ea&s;ons, I &s;hall only &s;ay that, to minds, unwilling to do right, all times are equally inconvenient and improper. To him, who di&s;likes the voyage, all the winds of Heaven are equally unpropitious. He looks for nothing but pretences to avoid it. The honourable and wor|thy repre&s;entative of York&s;hire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Duncombe.</NOTE> has declared him|&s;elf frankly, and without qualification or re&s;erve. He &s;ays he is a friend to a Reform of Parliament
<PB N="5" REF="4">
now and at all times, becau&s;e it is now as nece&s;&s;ary and as &s;afe as it can be at any other period. But, if the war be an immediate objection to the attempt, he tru&s;ts that objection will not la&s;t long, that it will not be permitted to &s;ub&s;i&s;t any longer to the ruin of the country. He con&s;iders the war, as I do, as in it&s;elf a mi&s;chief enormous. But, when the authors of it, not contented with the calamities in&s;eparable from war, make it a pretence for objecting to the only mea&s;ure that can re&s;tore and pre&s;erve the Con|&s;titution, the only one that can prevent &s;uch ruinous wars in future, then indeed it is time to remove this pernicious ob&s;tacle one of our way, and put an end to this treacherous objection. The honourable Ba|ronet, who &s;poke la&s;t, a&s;&s;ures us that our ideas of correcting abu&s;es are vi&s;ionary and impracticable; that they are incon&s;i&s;tent with that corrupted &s;tate of manners and morals, which riches and luxury have introduced into the nation, that the country is too great a merchant to be hone&s;t, that we are too commercial for our virtues, and this he &s;ays in the Hou&s;e of Commons of Great Britain, in the pre|&s;ence of the repre&s;entatives of the fir&s;t commercial nation in the world; and this he &s;ays, while his own per&s;onal independence &s;tands on the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a fortune derived from the very &s;ources of indu&s;|try and commerce. [<HI>Here Mr. Francis was called to order by Sir William Young.</HI>] I do a&s;&s;ure the honour|able Baronet, I had no thoughts of giving him of|fence. I &s;hall therefore content my&s;elf with ob|&s;erving generally, what I am convinced is true, that commerce in it&s;elf, and conducted on its true prin|ciples, as it has been in this country, excepting al|ways one &s;purious and di&s;honourable branch of it, has no tendency to corrupt or degrade the character of the people who are engaged in it; but that, on the contrary, by making them apply their faculties to active occupations, it keeps them out of vice,
<PB N="6" REF="5">
and that in proportion as commerce expands her operations, their real tendency is to enlarge, to en|lighten, and to improve the mind. But, if the fact were otherwi&s;e, what conclu&s;ion would he draw from it? Would he have us abandon the re&s;ources of our trade? Would he ri&s;k the lo&s;s or diminution of tho&s;e revenues, which alone can &s;upport the pre&s;ent war, in order to mend our morals? It may po&s;&s;ibly be true, as he &s;ays, that we are too commercial for our virtues; but I am afraid that our pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion calls for every contribution, with which com|merce can &s;upply us, and that neither the virtues nor the re&s;ources of the landed intere&s;t will be &s;uf|ficient to enable us to encounter the expences, the debts, and the di&s;tre&s;&s;es, which the pre&s;ent perni|cious war is likely to bring along with it. But the&s;e incidental reflections have carried me too far from the que&s;tion before us. It is time I &s;hould return to the purpo&s;e, for which I ro&s;e.</P>
<P>Sir, I voted again&s;t the adjournment la&s;t night, for other rea&s;ons, but principally becau&s;e I was de|&s;irous of adverting to &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in a very inge|nious &s;peech made by a right honourable friend of mine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Windham.</NOTE>, while they were fre&s;h in my memory. How|ever, as this is a continued debate, I believe I &s;hall be &s;trictly in order, in referring to what he &s;aid, as far as my memory will &s;erve me. I know my&s;elf and him too well, to think of entering into a competition of any kind with my right honourable friend. Be|tween him and me, a ho&s;tile conte&s;t, I am &s;ure, can never happen. My intention is, not to provoke an unfriendly difference, but to &s;olicit an amicable di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion, &s;uch as tho&s;e with which he his often fa|voured me, on other &s;ubj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">cts, and in happier times. If I &s;hould appear to que&s;tion his judgement, to com|bat his opinions, or, in this &s;ingle in&s;tance, and on this occa&s;ion only, to undervalue his eloquence, no
<PB N="7" REF="6">
man, I tru&s;t, will &s;u&s;pect me of the folly of pretend|ing to an equality with him. The rank and qualifi|cations of men &s;hould be mea&s;ured by their preten|&s;ions. To imagination or eloquence, I have none. But I will not de&s;cend &s;o low as to profe&s;s that I have no judgement, no judicial faculty whatever to examine or pronounce upon the genius and eloquence of others. It would be a poor affectation to &s;tultify my&s;elf for the &s;ake of a compari&s;on in favour of any man.</P>
<P>I cannot follow my right honourable friend in the endle&s;s excur&s;ions of his rapid imagination. Some|times he &s;oars &s;o high into the regions of the air, that it would require the eye and the wing of an eagle to pur&s;ue him. Then down he drops, with equal rapidity, from Heaven to earth, to the depths of the &s;ea, and to the waters under the earth. I cannot fly, nor &s;wim, nor dive as he does. But if, for a moment, he will conde&s;cend to re&s;train the prae|ternatural activity of his mind, or re&s;erve it for oc|ca&s;ions, in which fancy ought properly to predomi|nate over rea&s;on,&mdash;if he will de&s;cend from the&s;e al|titudes, and meet us on plain level ground, for the purpo&s;e of di&s;cu&s;&s;ing a plain terre&s;trial que&s;tion, not of ab&s;tract &s;peculation, not of theories untried, but of practical prudence; then, Sir, he &s;hall find me as ready to be guided by his wi&s;dom, as ever I have been to li&s;ten to his eloquence. On this &s;ubject, of all others, he is mo&s;t &s;trictly bound by his duties to &s;atisfy my under&s;tanding. On the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, in my judge|ment, he has not filled up the dimen&s;ions of his mind. He has been eloquent and brilliant; but as to the purpo&s;e, and bu&s;ine&s;s, and duty of the debate, he has totally failed. On this head, I have many com|plaints to make of him; but he may be &s;ure that I &s;hall never appeal again&s;t him to any man but him|&s;elf. In the fir&s;t place, then, I accu&s;e my right ho|nourable friend, in his own Court, of bad ta&s;te in
<PB N="8" REF="7">
the compo&s;ition of &s;ome of his late &s;peeches, particu|larly the la&s;t. Let the occa&s;ion, the &s;ubject, the ar|gument, be what it may, he has but one way of treating it. War and peace, the repair of a turnpike, the better government of nations, the direction of a canal, and the &s;ecurity of the con&s;titution, are all alike in his contemplation. The French revolution is an an&s;wer to every thing; the French revolution is his everla&s;ting theme, the univer&s;al remedy, the grand &s;pecific, the never-failing panacea, the per|petual burden of his &s;ong; and with this he treats us from day to day; a cold, flat, in&s;ipid ha&s;h of the &s;ame di&s;h, perpetually &s;erved up to us in different &s;hapes, till at la&s;t, with all his cookery, the ta&s;te revolts, the palate &s;ickens at it. Has he no choice of topics? Has he lo&s;t the fertility of his mind? Are the re&s;ources of his imagination dried up or ex|hau&s;ted? Has he no way of oppo&s;ing a reform of corruptions and abu&s;es in our own &s;y&s;tem, but by telling us ince&s;&s;antly what mi&s;chiefs have been done by madmen in another country, acting in circum|&s;tances totally different from ours! Has he no other way to convince and &s;atisfy &s;ober Engli&s;hmen, de|bating on a great and &s;erious intere&s;t of their own, but by warning them again&s;t the folly and wicked|ne&s;s of the French! Let me intreat my right ho|nourable friend, if his wit and wi&s;dom be fairly worn out in the &s;ervice, to con&s;ole us at lea&s;t with a little variety. I know he is a privileged Per&s;on; I know with what favour he is heard at pre|&s;ent. Yet, after all, it is not generous in him to per&s;ecute, as he does, &s;o patient an audience. But the&s;e are trifles. I have a heavier charge again&s;t my right honourable friend, of which he him&s;elf &s;hall be the judge; for the confidence I repo&s;e in his ho|nour and in his virtue is unbounded. I accu&s;e him of &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of evidence in the very &s;tatement of his own favourite argument, of palpable partiality and inju&s;tice to us, to the French, and to him&s;elf.
<PB N="9" REF="8">
The eminence of his mind ought to give him a commanding view of every part of every &s;ubject, to which he applies it. If the French revolution be his theme, I expect it from his per&s;onal honour, I demand it from his ju&s;tice, that he will bring the whole of the que&s;tion impartially before us. I can|not &s;uffer him to confine the comprehen&s;ive powers of his &s;uperior under&s;tanding to narrow imperfect views of &s;o great a &s;ubject of meditation and in&s;truc|tion. I deny that there is any fair, any rational conclu&s;ion to be drawn from the circum&s;tances of the French revolution to the &s;ituation of this country. The people of England neither want the warning nor the le&s;&s;on. But let him &s;tate it &s;o, if he plea&s;es. Give us the example, but give it to us entire. Is it fair, is it hone&s;t, is it truly in&s;tructive, to in&s;i&s;t upon the mi&s;chiefs, which the French revolution has pro|duced, and to keep out of our &s;ight the original enormous mi&s;chief, which produced the revolution? What u&s;e, what benefit, what le&s;&s;on, am I to derive from a bare knowledge of the effect, if the cau&s;e of that effect be carefully concealed from me? Let him bring the ca&s;e completely before us, and then I &s;hall leave him at liberty to load whatever part of it he may think the mo&s;t odious in the in&s;tance, or mo&s;t dan|gerous in the example. He cannot paint to me the horrible crimes and calamities with which the French revolution has been attended, without carrying back my mind to the &s;ource and origin of tho&s;e evils&mdash;to that infernal de&s;poti&s;m, under who&s;e rod a mild and generous people have been perverted into a nation of &s;avages. Such was the &s;chool, the ma&s;ter, and the education. What &s;cholars did he expect from it? If he &s;tates the premi&s;es fairly, and argues regularly from them, I care not to what length he carries the deduction; his conclu&s;ion mu&s;t be mine. The fruit has been bitter indeed, and bla&s;ted be the tree that produced it! The&s;e are the grand comprehen&s;ive
<PB N="10" REF="9">
le&s;&s;ons, which I expected from the genius and wi&s;|dom of my right honourable friend. In me, it is no flattery, no compliment to acknowledge the in|tellectual &s;uperiority of his mind. He knows how little I value the&s;e advantages in them&s;elves. The abilities of eminent men are their weapons, not their merits: let us &s;ee what u&s;e they make of them.&mdash;How has it happened, how was it po&s;&s;ible, that of all the important reflections, &s;ugge&s;ted by the events which have happened in France, the only one really applicable to the in&s;truction of tho&s;e whom it concerns in this country, &s;hould have e&s;caped him! I mean to &s;tate it in the form of a &s;uppo&s;ition only, and leave the inference to be drawn and applied by every man to his own u&s;e.</P>
<P>We have &s;een the con&s;equence in France of driving a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive people to the violent application of ex|treme remedies to extreme di&s;orders. Let me a&s;k my right honourable friend, or any man, who knows what the internal &s;tate of France was for a few years before the late convul&s;ions, whether if, at any earlier period, &s;uppo&s;e for example at the accce&s;&s;ion of Louis the Sixteenth, there had been wi&s;dom and virtue enough in the con&s;tituted powers and orders of the kingdom, in the Mini&s;ters of the executive power, in the nobility, in the clergy, in the Parliaments, to have granted &s;ome rea&s;onable, though moderate relief to the people, to have corrected &s;ome of the mo&s;t intolerable abu&s;es in the Government, to have &s;urrendered &s;ome part of their own invidious, op|pre&s;&s;ive, and very often u&s;ele&s;s privileges with a good grace&mdash;whether, in that ca&s;e, he does not think it probable that the ruin, which their ob&s;tinate adherence to the e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;y&s;tem has brought on them&s;elves, and on their country, would have been prevented? For my&s;elf I can affirm, that it is not po&s;&s;ible for the human mind to feel, on &s;uch a &s;ubject, a conviction more decided and complete
<PB N="11" REF="10">
than I do, that, if the prudent conce&s;&s;ions I allude to, had been made in time, the monarchy of France at this hour would have &s;tood untouched, and that the heirarchy, the nobility, and the law, in&s;tead of being cru&s;hed and demoli&s;hed as they have been, would have remained in their places unmoved, with no material diminution either of profit or &s;plendor, and certainly with greater &s;ecurity than ever. They yielded at la&s;t, but at la&s;t it was too late. Upon <HI>us,</HI> I hope, the example of their conduct and its con&s;e|quences will not be thrown away.</P>
<P>I have impeached the ta&s;te and ju&s;tice of my right honourable friend. But I have another appeal to make to his per&s;onal &s;pirit, which I know to be as high as belongs to any man. Let me intreat him to con&s;ider, whether it be con&s;i&s;tent with his character, to exhibit &s;o much courage, where there is &s;o little provocation or occa&s;ion for it. On the crimes com|mitted in France it is an ea&s;y matter to enlarge: but to what purpo&s;e? Who is there in this Hou&s;e to be convinced or converted on that &s;ubject? He may flouri&s;h his &s;word in perfect &s;afety on this ground, as all men may do who have nobody to contend with. Certainly he will meet with no oppo&s;ition, but on the contrary, the mo&s;t hearty concurrence in me and every per&s;on with whom I have the honour of acting in this place. With all his imagination I defy him to conceive, with all his eloquence I defy him to ex|pre&s;s, a deeper &s;en&s;ation of di&s;gu&s;t and dete&s;tation, than all of us have felt at the abominable &s;cenes which have lately been exhibited at Paris.</P>
<P>My right honourable friend mu&s;t now permit me to lay another in&s;tance of inju&s;tice to his charge,&mdash;extraordinary indeed in its nature, though not very important in its effect; and this &s;hall be the la&s;t.&mdash;The Hou&s;e have heard him, with every plea&s;ure that belongs to a&s;toni&s;hment, while he ranged over the whole circuit of human &s;cience, and glided through
<PB N="12" REF="11">
every region of the moral as well as the intellectual world; through ethics, mechanics, pneumatics, hydraulics, geography, mathematics, a&s;tronomy, and logic; through all the polite arts, of &s;wimming, flying, burning, &s;kaiting, diving; the learning of his library, and the meditations of his clo&s;et. On one &s;ubject alone he has &s;tudiou&s;ly maintained a mo&s;t delicate re&s;erve. The unfortunate motion on your table, as far as I am able to recollect, has never been ble&s;t with a &s;ingle moment of his attention. On the actual &s;ubject of the debate, you may find him every where but at home. One would have thought, Sir, that the power or invention could have added nothing to the curio&s;ity of this proceeding. Other men, perhaps, with indu&s;try and re&s;olution, might have &s;tated the premi&s;es, and applied them to the que&s;tion as accurately as he has done. But it was re&s;erved for the genius of my honourable friend to di&s;cover a connection between tho&s;e premi&s;es, and the conclu|&s;ion he has drawn from them. After giving the Hou&s;e a &s;pecimen of his &s;kill in every department of ab&s;tract &s;cience, of the depth of his theories and the extent of his &s;peculations, without be&s;towing a &s;ingle glance on the &s;imple que&s;tion, whether we &s;hall or &s;hall not appoint a Committee to con&s;ider the petition, my honourable friend turns &s;hort upon us, and &s;ays, <HI>Look you, gentlemen, I am a plain practical man. I take things as they are. My opinions are founded on experience. It is you, philo&s;ophers, you theori&s;ts, you metaphy&s;icians, who have done all the mi&s;chief, and would do much more, if you were not counteracted by &s;imple, &s;olid, experimental under&s;tandings, &s;uch as mine!</HI>&mdash;I believe, Sir, I may venture to &s;ay, that a more noble in&s;tance, than this, of bold and vigorous incon|gruity, a more intrepid <HI>di&s;parate,</HI> as I think the Spaniards call it, is not to be found in modern or ancient eloquence.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12">In the cour&s;e of this debate &s;ome remarks have been made on the petition on your table, and &s;ome invidi|ous inquiries about the per&s;ons who have &s;igned it. Allow me to an&s;wer them by &s;tating the fact. Un|doubtedly, Sir, if they, who have prepared this pe|tition, had thought that the authority of numbers would be u&s;eful to &s;trengthen the remon&s;trances it contains, or to inforce the prayer of it, they might ea&s;ily have contrived to get it &s;igned by many thou|&s;ands. But, if they had done &s;o, what would have been the con&s;equence? We &s;hould immediately have been told, and I think with rea&s;on, <HI>You have brought us a long, laboured, intricate repre&s;entation, &s;igned by multitudes, who could not po&s;&s;ibly have read it, or known what they were &s;igning.</HI> Fore&s;eeing this reflection, we have taken a wi&s;er cour&s;e. The petition is &s;igned by a few: but by no man, who has not read it, who does not under&s;tand the contents, and is not convinced of the truth of it. The quality of the petitioners too, I pre&s;ume, will be thought to entitle them to attention. It is not that I regard the&s;e factitious di&s;tinctions my|&s;elf; but they, who do, may be a&s;&s;ured that the ma|jority of the petitioners I know, and all of them, I believe, are gentlemen who, in point of rank and for|tune, are on a level with the generality of this Hou&s;e, and that, if I had not been precluded by my &s;ituation in Parliament, I &s;hould have been proud of &s;igning it my&s;elf, and even have claimed it as the po&s;t of ho|nour to have taken my &s;tation among the foremo&s;t in the li&s;t. I have no earthly per&s;onal intere&s;t in the &s;uc|ce&s;s of the mea&s;ure. On the contrary, the agitation of this que&s;tion has been to me the &s;ource of infinite per&s;onal unea&s;ine&s;s; of coldne&s;s, di&s;tance, and &s;epa|ration in private life, where once the warme&s;t friend|&s;hip and affection have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; but my heart and mind go with the mea&s;ure, and, while there is hope, I never &s;hall abandon it.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13">An honourable gentleman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Jenkin&s;on.</NOTE>, I think, ob&s;erved la&s;t night, that, in fact, there was no occa&s;ion for &s;o ge|neral a remedy as that which the petition aimed at. He did not deny that corruption exi&s;ted in the election of the Hou&s;e of Commons; but in part, he defended the practice as a thing tolerable in it&s;elf, and for the re&s;t, he a&s;&s;ured us, that the wor&s;t part of the abu&s;es in que&s;tion were gradually decrea&s;ing; that, as the in&s;tances occurred, they would be &s;ucce&s;&s;ively cor|rected, and that, let the evil be what it would, this was the be&s;t way of removing it. That honourable gentleman will pardon me, if, with longer experience and ob&s;ervation of the &s;ubject, I differ from him about the fact. I affirm, with certain knowledge, that cor|ruption has been for many years, and is in a &s;tate of progre&s;&s;ion; that is, from the Revolution to this hour. How it &s;tands now, I need not attempt to explain; for I am in the company of tho&s;e, who under&s;tand the &s;ubject as well as I do. But I beg leave to &s;tate to the honourable gentleman what the &s;ituation of parliamentary bribery and corruption was in this coun|try about twenty years ago. The in&s;tance is curious and the authority unque&s;tionable. I take it from a letter written by the late Earl of Che&s;terfield to his &s;on, never intended to be made public, and uncon|nected with party views of any kind, even tho&s;e of the time he lived in.</P>
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Extract of a letter from the Earl of Che&s;terfield to his &s;on, dated December the</HI> 19<HI>th,</HI> 1767.
<P>"Since that I have heard no more of it, which made me look out for &s;ome venal borough; and I &s;poke to a borough jobber, and offered five-and-twenty hun|dred pounds for a &s;ecure &s;eat in Parliament; but he laughed at my offer, and &s;aid that there was no &s;uch
<PB N="15" REF="14">
thing as a borough to be had now; for the rich Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indians had &s;ecured them all, at the rate of three thou&s;and pounds at lea&s;t; but many at four thou&s;and; and two or three that he knew, at five thou&s;and."</P></Q>
<P>Perhaps it will be &s;aid, the times are mended. Sir, for my&s;elf I can only prote&s;t, that I have &s;ome rea&s;on to think otherwi&s;e. So far from any fall having taken place in the price of boroughs, I believe it never was higher than it has been lately, and that the mo&s;t unfair advantages have been taken by dealers and chapmen, of cu&s;tomers in particular &s;ituations.&mdash;I have heard of a worthy gentleman who, after having made his bar|gain for five thou&s;and pounds, without being known to the other party, was charged &s;ix thou&s;and as &s;oon as his name was di&s;covered, and merely becau&s;e the proprietor of the commodity would not take le&s;s from an hone&s;t gentleman, who had exi&s;ted in the Ea&s;t Indies. You will allow, Sir, that the worthy per&s;on I allude to was hardly treated in that affair.&mdash;I give you this in&s;tance, out of many, as a proof of the actual &s;tate of the abu&s;e. You &s;ee, by Lord Che&s;terfield's letter, how the ca&s;e &s;tood twenty years ago. Do you &s;eriou&s;ly believe that the purity of bo|rough mongers, and the morals of the electors of Great Britain, are mended &s;ince that time? that the com|modity is not &s;o &s;carce, or the demand for it not &s;o con&s;iderable as it has been heretofore? On that point, I can give you nothing but my own opinion and con|viction, and I &s;hall give it to you now, in the &s;olemn adopted language of Parliament, <HI>that corruption has increa&s;ed, is increa&s;ing, and ought to be dimini&s;hed.</HI></P>
