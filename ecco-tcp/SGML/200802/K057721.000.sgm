<L>FLY, comic &s;cenes! where di&s;tant Ganges laves</L>
<L>Hindo&s;tan's golden &s;hores, with hallow'd waves;</L>
<L>Where palms gigantic rear their tufted heads,</L>
<L>And nature in colo&s;&s;al vegetation &s;preads,</L>
<L>Where rich ananas court the Indian's eye,</L>
<L>And groves of citrons fan the fev'ri&s;h &s;ky,</L>
<L>Where rattling canes around the riv'lets play,</L>
<L>And the centennial aloe drinks the day!</L>
<L>In their deep &s;hades bid Lucidorus &s;mile,</L>
<L>His heavy &s;en&s;e of <HI>di&s;tant</HI> hours beguile.</L>
<L>Bid him not think, becau&s;e I gaily write,</L>
<L>That heavy hours to him, to me, are light;</L>
<L>My native &s;pirits, bounding from repo&s;e,</L>
<L>Bear me, unwilling, where Ca&s;talia flows.</L>
<L>I love to weep, love the &s;oft fea&s;t of grief,</L>
<L>Court mournful thoughts, nor ever wi&s;h relief;&mdash;</L>
<L><HI>Sadne&s;s</HI> I woo, yet &s;till the phantom flies,</L>
<L>And <HI>joy</HI> &s;educes, whil&s;t I a&s;k for &s;ighs.</L>
<L><PB N="ii" REF="3">
But Hymen frowns, and joy no longer cheers,</L>
<L>Weeping, I &s;ink&mdash;Thalia drinks my tears:</L>
<L>He tears my heart; &s;he my rapt &s;oul in&s;pires;</L>
<L>He chills with grief; &s;he fills me with her fires.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, Lucidorus! pa&s;s <HI>my</HI> di&s;tant hours&mdash;</L>
<L>By turns &s;ubdued, the &s;lave of rival powers;</L>
<L>And thus hath nature in my little frame</L>
<L>Still various been, and variou&s;ly the &s;ame.</L>
<L>My heart &s;o keenly feels, 'twere death to live,</L>
<L>Did not bright &s;pirits its &s;trong &s;en&s;e relieve.</L>
<L>Through THESE capricious, de&s;ultory, gay,</L>
<L>As though I felt not, glides th' uncon&s;cious day;</L>
<L>Through THIS I droop, I &s;adden, and complain,</L>
<L>Dragging, with pen&s;ive &s;teps, life's length'ning chain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In blithe&s;ome mood <HI>"More Ways than One"</HI> had birth,</L>
<L>Offspring of brilliant morns, and eves of mirth;</L>
<L>The laughing mu&s;e in &s;prightlie&s;t vein was by,</L>
<L>And "quips, and cranks," lay lurking in her eye.</L>
<L>O! may her &s;pirit from its pages dart,</L>

<P>Alas, poor Doctor!&mdash;no more fees&mdash;he has given you the <HI>go-by</HI> fairly.

<P>Aye, 'twas a crying &s;in, to let &s;uch a &s;pirited fine young fellow be kick'd out of life by a ra&s;cally little feveret!

<P>Oh, Sir, I have a great heart&mdash;a pro|digious great heart! its feelings are for the faculty. A girl may run away from an uncle without reproach to him; but when a patient runs away from the &s;entence of his phy&s;ician, the reputation of the doctor mu&s;t &s;oon run after him.</P>
