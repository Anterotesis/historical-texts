<HEAD>THOUGHTS ON PUBLIC WORSHIP, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are &s;ome practices which have not been defended becau&s;e they have never been attacked. Of this number is <HI>Public or Social Wor&s;hip.</HI> It has been recom|mended, urged, enforced, but never vindi|cated. Through worldline&s;s, &s;ceptici&s;m, indolence, di&s;&s;atisfaction with the manner of conducting it, it has been often neg|lected; but it is a new thing to hear it condemned. The pious and the good have lamented its in&s;ufficiency to the reforma|tion
<PB REF="5">

<PB N="2" REF="6">
of the world, but they were yet to learn that it was unfriendly to it. Sati&s;|fied with &s;ilent and &s;olitary de&s;ertion, tho&s;e who did not concur in the homage paid by their fellow-citizens were content to ac|quie&s;ce in its propriety, and had not hi|therto a&s;&s;umed the dignity of a &s;ect. A late pamphlet of Mr. Wakefield's has there|fore excited the attention of the public, partly, no doubt, from the known abili|ties of the author, but &s;till more from the novelty and &s;trangene&s;s of the doctrine. If intended as an apology, no publication can be more &s;ea&s;onable, but if meant as an exhor|tation, or rather a dehortation, it is a la|bour which many will think, from the complexion of the times and the tendencies of increa&s;ing habits, might well have been &s;pared. It is an awkward circum&s;tance for the apo&s;tle of &s;uch a per&s;ua&s;ion, that he will have many practical di&s;ciples whom he will hardly care to own; and that if he &s;ucceeds in making pro&s;elytes, he mu&s;t take them <HI>from</HI> the more &s;ober and orderly part of the community; and cla&s;s them,
<PB N="3" REF="7">
as far as this circum&s;tance affords a di&s;tinc|tion, along with the uneducated, the pro|fligate, and the unprincipled. The nega|tive tenet he inculcates, does not mark his converts with &s;ufficient precifion: their &s;crupulo&s;ity will be in danger of being con|founded with the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of their neigh|bours; and it will be always nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;k, Do you ab&s;tain becau&s;e you are of this religion, or becau&s;e you are of no religion at all?</P>
<P>It would be unfair, however, to endea|vour to render Mr. Wakefield's opinions invidious: they, as well as every other opi|nion, mu&s;t be &s;ubmitted to the te&s;t of ar|gument; and Public Wor&s;hip, as well as every other practice, mu&s;t &s;tand on the ba&s;is of utility and good &s;en&s;e, or it mu&s;t not &s;tand at all: and in the latter ca&s;e, it is immaterial whether it is left to moulder like the neglected ruin, or battered down like the formidable tower.</P>
<P>It will &s;tand upon this ba&s;is, if it can be &s;hewn to be agreeable to our nature, &s;anctioned by univer&s;al practice, coun|tenanced
<PB N="4" REF="8">
by revealed religion, and that its tendencies are favourable to the morals and manners of mankind.</P>
<P>What is Public Wor&s;hip? Kneeling down together while prayers are &s;aid of a certain length and con&s;truction, and hear|ing di&s;cour&s;es made to a &s;entence of &s;crip|ture called a text!&mdash;Such might be the de|finition of an unenlightened per&s;on, but &s;uch would certainly not be Mr. Wake|field's. The que&s;tion ought to be agitated on much larger ground. If the&s;e practices are &s;hewn to be novel, it does not follow that Public Wor&s;hip is &s;o, in that exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e which includes all modes and varie|ties of expre&s;&s;ion. To e&s;tabli&s;h its anti|quity, we mu&s;t therefore inve&s;tigate its nature.</P>
<P>Public Wor&s;hip is the public expre&s;&s;ion of homage to the Sovereign of the univer&s;e. It is that tribute from men united in fami|lies, in towns, in communities, which in|dividually men owe to their Maker. Every nation has therefore found &s;ome organ by which to expre&s;s this homage, &s;ome lan|guage,
<PB N="5" REF="9">
rite, or &s;ymbol, by which to make known their religious feelings; but this organ has not always, nor chiefly been words. The killing an animal, the throw|ing a few grains of incen&s;e into the fire, the eating bread and drinking wine, are all in them&s;elves indifferent actions, and have apparently little connection with devotion; yet all of the&s;e have been u&s;ed as wor&s;hip, and are wor&s;hip when u&s;ed with that in|tention. The &s;olemn &s;acrifices and anni|ver&s;ary fe&s;tivals of the Jews, at which their capital and their temple were thronged with votaries from every di&s;tant part of the kingdom, were &s;plendid expre&s;&s;ions of their religious homage. Their Wor&s;hip, indeed, was interwoven with their whole civil con&s;titution; and &s;o, though in a &s;ub|ordinate degree, was that of the Greeks and Romans, and mo&s;t of the &s;tates of an|tiquity. There has never exi&s;ted a nation, at all civilized, which has not had &s;ome appointed form of &s;upplication, &s;ome &s;tated mode of &s;ignifying the dependance we are under to the &s;upreme Being, and as a na|tion
<PB N="6" REF="10">
imploring his protection. It is not pretended that the&s;e modes were all equally rational, equally edifying, equally proper for imitation, equally &s;uitable for every &s;tate of &s;ociety; they have varied accord|ing as a nation was more or le&s;s advanced in refinement and decorum, more or le&s;s addicted to &s;ymbolical expre&s;&s;ion&mdash;to vio|lent ge&s;ticulation&mdash;and more or le&s;s con|ver&s;ant with ab&s;tract ideas and metaphy|&s;ical &s;peculation. But whether the Deity is wor&s;hipped by &s;trewing flowers and building tabernacles of verdure; by dances round the altar and the &s;houts of a cheerful people; by offering the fir&s;t fruits of har|ve&s;t, and partaking in the &s;ocial fea&s;t; by tones of mu&s;ic, interpreted only by the heart; or by verbal expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude and adoration&mdash;whether the hallelujahs of a&s;&s;embled multitudes ri&s;e together in &s;o|lemn chorus; or whether they li&s;ten with compo&s;ed and reverential attention to the voice of one man, appointed by them to be the organ of their feelings&mdash;whether a number of people meet together like the
<PB N="7" REF="11">
Quakers, and each in &s;ilence prefers his mental petition&mdash;wherever men together perform a &s;tated act as an expre&s;&s;ion of homage to their Maker, there is the e&s;&s;ence of public wor&s;hip; and public wor&s;hip has therefore this mark of being agreeable to the nature of man, that it has been found agreeable to the &s;en&s;e of mankind in all ages and nations.</P>
<P>It is, indeed, difficult to imagine that beings, &s;en&s;ible of common wants and a common nature, &s;hould <HI>not</HI> join together in imploring common ble&s;&s;ings; that, prone as men are in every other circum&s;tance to a&s;&s;ociate together, and communicate the electric fire of corre&s;pondent feelings, they &s;hould act with un&s;ocial re&s;erve only where tho&s;e intere&s;ts are concerned which are con|fe&s;&s;edly the mo&s;t important. Such is the temperament of man, that in every act and every event he anxiou&s;ly looks around him to claim the gratulation or &s;ympathy of his fellows. Religion, &s;ays Mr. Wake|field, is a per&s;onal thing; &s;o is marriage, &s;o is the birth of a child, &s;o is the lo&s;s of a
<PB N="8" REF="12">
beloved relative, yet on all the&s;e occa&s;ions we are &s;trongly impelled to public &s;olemni|zation. We neither laugh alone, nor weep alone, why then &s;hould we pray alone? None of our feelings are of a more commu|nicable nature than our religious ones. If devotion really exi&s;ts in the heart of each individual, it is morally impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould exi&s;t there apart and &s;ingle. So many &s;e|parate tapers, burning &s;o near each other, in the very nature of things mu&s;t catch, and &s;pread into one common flame. The reciprocal advantages, which public and private wor&s;hip po&s;&s;e&s;s over each other, are &s;ufficiently obvious to make both de&s;irable. While the former is more animated, the latter comes more intimately home to our own circum&s;tances and feelings, and allows our devotion to be more particular and ap|propriated. To mo&s;t of the objections made again&s;t the one, the other is equally liable. Super&s;tition can drop her &s;olitary beads, as well as vociferate the repetition of a public collect: if &s;ymptoms of weari|ne&s;s and inattention may be ob&s;erved in our
<PB N="9" REF="13">
churches, we have only to look into the diaries of the mo&s;t pious Chri&s;tians, and we &s;hall find &s;till heavier complaints of the dulne&s;s and deadne&s;s of their &s;piritual frame: the thoughts may wander in the clo&s;et when the door is &s;hut: folly and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s will &s;end up improper petitions from the cell as well as from the congre|gation: nay Public Wor&s;hip has this great advantage, that it teaches tho&s;e to pray, who, not being accu&s;tomed to think, can|not of them&s;elves pray with judgment. To all, it teaches that we are not to pray for exclu&s;ive advantages, but to con&s;ider our&s;elves as members of a community. Our inmo&s;t wi&s;hes learn re&s;traint while our petitions are thus directed, and our de&s;ires by degrees conform them&s;elves to that &s;pirit of moderation and ju&s;tice, without which we cannot join in the comprehen&s;ive prayer, that mu&s;t include the joint &s;upplications of a numerous a&s;&s;embly.&mdash;Public Wor&s;hip has this further advantage over private, that it is better &s;ecured again&s;t languor on one &s;ide, and enthu&s;ia&s;m on the other. If the
<PB N="10" REF="14">
devotional &s;entiment has not taken deep root in his mind, a man will &s;carcely keep up, in &s;ilence and in &s;olitude, an intercour&s;e to which he is prompted by no external appearance, and of which he is reminded by no circum&s;tance of time or place. And if his &s;ense of invi&s;ible things is &s;trong enough to engage his mind in &s;pite of the&s;e di&s;advantages, there is room to fear, le&s;t, by brooding in &s;ilence over objects of &s;uch indi&s;tinct va&s;tne&s;s, his bewildered ideas and exalted imagination &s;hould lead him to the reveries of my&s;tici&s;m; an extreme no le&s;s to be dreaded than that of indifference. When Mr. Wakefield, to &s;trengthen his ar|gument for &s;eclu&s;ion in our religious exer|ci&s;es, directs our attention to the mount of Olives and the garden of Geth&s;emane, he &s;hould recollect that our Saviour &s;u&s;tained a character to which we cannot pre&s;ume to a&s;pire; and that, however favourable the de&s;ert and the wilderne&s;s have been to pro|phets vi&s;ited by extraordinary illuminations, they cannot be equally &s;uitable to the re|gular devotion of ordinary Chri&s;tians.
<PB N="11" REF="15">
From the gloom of the cloi&s;ter and the loneline&s;s of the cell, have proceeded the mo&s;t extravagant deviations from nature and from rea&s;on. Enthu&s;ia&s;m is indeed mo&s;t dangerous in a crowd, but it &s;eldom origi|nates there. The mind, heated with inten&s;e thinking, adopts illu&s;ions to which it is not expo&s;ed when its devotion is guided and bounded by addre&s;&s;es which are in|tended to meet the common &s;entiments of a numerous a&s;&s;embly. Religion then ap|pears with the mo&s;t benignant a&s;pect, is then lea&s;t likely to be mi&s;taken, when the pre&s;ence of our fellow-creatures points out its connection with the bu&s;ine&s;&s;es of life and the duties of &s;ociety. Solitary devo|tion, for wordly minds, is in&s;ufficient, for weak minds it is not profitable, for ar|dent minds it is not &s;afe.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t however do that ju&s;tice to the author of the Enquiry, as to confe&s;s that he betrays no di&s;po&s;ition to carry the&s;e exerci&s;es to any extreme. On the contrary, &s;ome of his expre&s;&s;ions &s;eem to &s;trike at the root of all <HI>prayer,</HI> properly &s;o called, as being the
<PB N="12" REF="16">
weak effort of an infirm and unphilo&s;ophical mind to alter the order of nature and the decrees of Providence, in which it rather becomes the wi&s;e man to acquie&s;ce with a manly re&s;ignation. Without entering into a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, in which, perhaps, we might mi&s;repre&s;ent his &s;entiments; as, in the greater part of his pamphlet, he has taken the ground of &s;cripture, which undoubt|edly countenances the earne&s;tne&s;s, and almo&s;t the importunity of petition; it may be &s;ufficient for the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to ob|&s;erve, that if there exi&s;ts a man who, be|lieving him&s;elf to be in the continual pre|&s;ence of infinite power, directed by infinite love and tender compa&s;&s;ion to all his crea|tures&mdash;thinking often of this Being, and habitually referring every di&s;po&s;ition of events to his providence&mdash;feeling him&s;elf more con&s;tantly and intimately connected with him than with all creation be&s;ides&mdash;can in every vici&s;&s;itude of his life, in &s;ick|ne&s;s and in &s;orrow, in imminent danger, anxious uncertainty, de&s;ertion or lo&s;s of friends, and all the trying circum&s;tances of
<PB N="13" REF="17">
humanity that fle&s;h is heir to; forbear, for him&s;elf or for tho&s;e dearer to him than him&s;elf, to put up one petition to the throne of God&mdash;&s;uch a one may be al|lowed to &s;trike out every petition in the Lord's Prayer but that comprehen&s;ive one, <HI>thy will be done.</HI> If his faith be equally lively, his devotional feelings equally fer|vent, his &s;en&s;e of dependence upon God equally felt in his inmo&s;t &s;oul, we dare not pre&s;ume to cen&s;ure the temperance of his religious addre&s;&s;es. We re&s;pect the &s;ub|dued &s;obriety of his wi&s;hes, and we do not, we cannot &s;uppo&s;e him de&s;erted by the &s;upreme Being for that mode&s;t forbear|ance which proceeds from a re&s;ignation &s;o ab&s;olute and complete. Others, however, who&s;e philo&s;ophy is not of &s;o firm a tex|ture, may plead the example of him who prayed, though with meek &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, that the cup of bitterne&s;s might pa&s;s from him; and who, as the moment of &s;epara|tion approached, interceded for his friends and followers with all the anxiety of affec|tionate tenderne&s;s. But we will venture
<PB N="14" REF="18">
to &s;ay that practically there is no &s;uch phi|lo&s;opher.&mdash;If prayer were not enjoined for the perfection, it would be permitted to the weakne&s;s of our nature. We &s;hould be betrayed into it, if we thought it &s;in, and pious ejaculations would e&s;cape our lips, though we were obliged to preface them with, God forgive me for praying!</P>
<P>To tho&s;e who pre&s;s the objection, that we cannot &s;ee in what manner our prayers can be an&s;wered, con&s;i&s;tently with the go|vernment of the world according to tho&s;e general laws by which we find, in fact, that it is governed; it may be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that prayer, being made almo&s;t an in&s;tinct of our nature, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed but that, like all other in&s;tincts, it has its u&s;e; that no idea can be <HI>le&s;s</HI> philo&s;ophical than one which implies, that the exi&s;tence of a God who governs the world, &s;hould make no difference in our conduct; and few things le&s;s probable than that the child-like &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which bows to the will of a fa|ther, &s;hould be exactly &s;imilar in feature to the &s;tubborn patience which bends under the yoke of nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="19">
It may be further ob&s;erved, that petitions for temporal advantages, &s;uch, I mean, as a &s;pirit of moderation will allow us to <HI>wi&s;h</HI> with &s;ufficient ardour to make them the &s;ubject of our prayers, are not liable to more objections than petitions for &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings. In either ca&s;e the weak man does, and the wi&s;e man does not expect a miracle. That the arrogant, the worldly, and the licentious, &s;hould on a &s;udden, and without their own &s;trenuous endeavours, be rendered humble, &s;imple-minded, and pure of heart, would be as great a violation of the order of nature in the moral world, as it would be in the natural world that the harve&s;t &s;hould ripen without the co-opera|tion of the hu&s;bandman, and the &s;low in|fluence of the &s;ea&s;ons. Indeed, as tem|poral ble&s;&s;ings are le&s;s in our power than di&s;po&s;itions, and are &s;ometimes entirely out of it, it &s;eems more rea&s;onable of the two to pray for the former than for the latter; and it is remarkable that, in the model given us in the Lord's Prayer, there is not a &s;ingle petition for any virtue or good di&s;|po&s;ition,
<PB N="16" REF="20">
but there is one for daily bread. Good di&s;po&s;itions, particularly a &s;pirit of re|&s;ignation, are declared and implied in the petitions, but they are not prayed for: events are prayed for, and circum&s;tances out of our own power, relative to our &s;pi|ritual concerns, are prayed for, as, the not being led into temptation; but there is no prayer that we may be <HI>made</HI> holy, meek, or merciful. Nor is it an objection to pray|ing for health, that &s;ickne&s;s may po&s;&s;ibly turn out a ble&s;&s;ing, &s;ince it is no objection to the u&s;ing all the means in our power to get rid of &s;ickne&s;s, which we do as eagerly and as unre&s;ervedly as if we had not the lea&s;t idea that it ever could be &s;alutary. And we do right; for the advantages of &s;ickne&s;s are ca&s;ual and adventitious; but health is in it&s;elf, and in its natural ten|dencies, a ble&s;&s;ing <HI>devoutly to be wi&s;hed for.</HI> That no advantage of this nature ought to be prayed or wi&s;hed for, unqualified with the deepe&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of God, is an undoubted truth; and it is a truth likewi&s;e univer&s;ally acknowledged by all rational Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="21">
It cannot be denied, however, that great re&s;erve is nece&s;&s;ary in putting up &s;pecific petitions, e&s;pecially of a public nature; but generally the fault lies in our engaging in wrong pur&s;uits, rather than in imploring upon our pur&s;uits the favour of heaven. Humanity is &s;hocked to hear prayers for the &s;ucce&s;s of an unju&s;t war; but huma|nity and heaven were <HI>then</HI> offended when the war was engaged in; for war is of a na|ture &s;ufficiently &s;erious to warrant our pray|ers to be pre&s;erved from the calamities of it, if we have not voluntarily expo&s;ed our|&s;elves to them. The frivolous nature of mo&s;t national conte&s;ts appears &s;trongly in this very circum&s;tance, that petitions from ei|ther &s;ide have the air of a profanation; but if in &s;ome &s;erious conjuncture our country was ready to be overwhelmed by an ambi|tious neighbour, as that of the Dutch was in the time of Louis the Fourteenth,&mdash;in &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on of calamity, the &s;terne&s;t phi|lo&s;opher would give way to the in&s;tinctive dictates of nature, and implore the help which cometh from on high. The rea|&s;on
<PB N="18" REF="22">
why <HI>both</HI> &s;ides cannot pray with pro|priety, is becau&s;e <HI>both</HI> &s;ides cannot act with ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing we were to di&s;card all pe|tition as the weak effort of infirm minds to alter the unbroken chain of events; as the impatient breathings of craving and re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirits, not broken into patient acquie&s;cence with the eternal order of Providence&mdash;the noble&s;t office of wor&s;hip &s;till remains.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Prai&s;e</HI> is devotion fit for mighty minds,</L>
<L>The jarring world's agreeing &s;acrifice.</L></Q>
<P>And this is &s;urely of a &s;ocial nature. One cla&s;s of religious duties &s;eparately con|&s;idered, tends to depre&s;s the mind, filling it with ingenuous &s;hame and whole&s;ome &s;orrow; and to the&s;e humiliating feelings &s;olitude might perhaps be found congenial: but the &s;entiments of admiration, love, and joy, &s;well the bo&s;om with emotions which &s;eek for fellow&s;hip and communication. The flame indeed may be kindled by &s;ilent mu&s;ing; but when kindled it mu&s;t infalli|bly &s;pread. The devout heart, penetrated
<PB N="19" REF="23">
with large and affecting views of the im|men&s;ity of the works of God, the harmony of his laws, and the extent of his benefi|cence, bur&s;ts into loud and vocal expre&s;|&s;ions of prai&s;e and adoration; and, from a full and overflowing &s;en&s;ibility, &s;eeks to expand it&s;elf to the utmo&s;t limits of cre|ation. The mind is forcibly carried out of it&s;elf, and, embracing the whole circle of animated exi&s;tence, calls on all above, around, below, to help to bear the burden of its gratitude. Joy is too brilliant a thing to be confined within our own bo&s;oms; it burni&s;hes all nature, and with its vivid colouring gives a kind of factitious life to objects without &s;en&s;e or motion. There cannot be a more &s;triking proof of the &s;o|cial tendency of the&s;e feelings, than the &s;trong propen&s;ity we have to <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> audit|ors where there are none. When men are wanting, we addre&s;s the animal creation; and, rather than have none to partake our &s;entiments, we find &s;entiment in the mu&s;ic of the birds, the hum of in&s;ects, and the low of kine: nay, we call on rocks and
<PB N="20" REF="24">
&s;treams and fore&s;ts to witne&s;s and &s;hare our emotions. Hence the royal &s;hepherd, &s;ojourning in caves and &s;olitary wa&s;tes, calls on the hills to rejoice and the floods to clap their hands; and the lonely poet, wandering in the deep rece&s;&s;es of unculti|vated nature, finds a temple in every &s;o|lemn grove, and &s;wells his chorus of prai&s;e with the winds that bow the lofty cedars. And can he who, not &s;atisfied with the wide range of exi&s;tence, calls for the &s;ym|pathy of the inanimate creation, refu&s;e to wor&s;hip with his fellow men? Can he who bids <Q REND="inline">"Nature attend,"</Q> forget to <Q REND="inline">"join every <HI>living</HI> &s;oul"</Q> in the univer&s;al hymn? Shall we <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> companions in the &s;tillne&s;s of de&s;erts, and &s;hall we overlook them among&s;t friends and town&s;men? It cannot be! Social wor&s;hip, for the devout heart, is not more a duty than it is a real want.</P>
<P>If Public Wor&s;hip is, thus found to be agreeable to the be&s;t impul&s;es of our na|ture, the pious mind will rejoice to find it, at lea&s;t, not di&s;countenanced by revealed

religion. But its friends, in endeavouring to prove this, mu&s;t carry on the argument under &s;ome di&s;advantage, as Mr. Wake|field, though he lays great &s;tre&s;s on the pre&s;umptive arguments which &s;eem to fa|vour the negative &s;ide of the que&s;tion, will not allow the &s;ame force to tho&s;e which may be urged on the other &s;ide. <HI>The practice of Chri&s;t,</HI> he tells us, <HI>is an authority to which all believers will bow the knee, a tribunal by which all our controver&s;ies mu&s;t be awarded:</HI> yet he gives us notice at the &s;ame time, that to this authority, if brought again&s;t him, he will not bow the knee; and from this tribunal, if unfriendly to his cau&s;e, he will appeal; for that prayers and all external ob&s;ervances <HI>are beggarly elements,</HI> to be laid a&s;ide in the pre&s;ent maturity of the Chri&s;|tian church; and that, <HI>even if &s;ocial wor|&s;hip were an original appendage of the go&s;pel,</HI> the idea of a <HI>progre&s;&s;ive Chri&s;tianity</HI> would ju&s;tify us in rejecting it. With this in|equality of conditions, which it is &s;ufficient ju&s;t to notice, let us con&s;ider the array of texts which are drawn up again&s;t the prac|tice

in que&s;tion; and particularly tho&s;e precepts which, Mr. Wakefield &s;ays, are evidences that <HI>directly</HI> and <HI>literally</HI> prove Public Wor&s;hip to be <HI>unauthorized by Chri&s;|tianity, and incon&s;i&s;tent with it,</HI> and which he di&s;tingui&s;hes from tho&s;e which condemn it merely by inference.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e direct evidences is the injunction, not to wor&s;hip as the hypo|crites, who are fond of exhibiting in the mo&s;t public places. <Q REND="inline">"And when thou praye&s;t, be not as the hypocrites, for they love to pray &s;tanding in the &s;ynagogues, and in the corners of the &s;treets, that they may be &s;een of men; verily I &s;ay unto you, they have their reward. But thou, when thou praye&s;t, enter into thy clo&s;et, and when thou ha&s;t &s;hut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in &s;ecret."</Q> But is it not evident, that the force of this precept is not aimed again&s;t public prayer, but again&s;t private prayer performed in public; again&s;t the o&s;tentatious di&s;play which &s;eeks to di&s;tin|gui&s;h us from others, not the genuine &s;ympathy which makes us de&s;irous of

blending our feelings with theirs? It was devotion obtruding it&s;elf in the face of bu|&s;ine&s;s, amid&s;t the &s;how and bu&s;tle of the world. It did not &s;eek for fellow&s;hip, but ob&s;ervation. It did not want the concur|rence of men, but to be &s;een by them. Even in the &s;ynagogue it was &s;ilent, &s;oli|tary, un&s;ocial, and with &s;ullen re&s;erve and cold di&s;dain kept it&s;elf aloof from commu|nion, and invited only applau&s;e. The Phari&s;ee and the Publican both went up to the temple to wor&s;hip, but they wor&s;hip|ped not together. Certainly the delicate and mode&s;t nature of &s;incere piety mu&s;t &s;hrink from an exhibition like this; and would not wi&s;h to have its feelings no|ticed, but where at the &s;ame time they may be &s;hared. This text therefore &s;eems to be only a caution re&s;pecting the proper performance of our <HI>clo&s;et</HI> duties.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Je&s;us &s;aith unto her, Woman, be|lieve me, the hour cometh when ye &s;hall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jeru|&s;alem, wor&s;hip the Father. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true wor|&s;hippers

&s;hall wor&s;hip the Father in &s;pirit and in truth, for the Father &s;eeketh &s;uch to wor&s;hip him. God is a &s;pirit."</Q> True it is, the hour is come in which it is allowed by all rational believers, that the acceptablene&s;s of prayer does not depend on the &s;acredne&s;s of any particular place. The Jews wanted to be informed of this. They, naturally enough, were apt to con&s;ider their temple as the habitation of the divine Being, in the &s;ame manner as a palace is the habitation of an earthly &s;overeign, a place where men may come to make their court, and bring pre&s;ents, and a&s;k favours in return. The&s;e ideas have been done away by tho&s;e more honourable notions of the divine Being which our Saviour and good men after him have laboured to in|culcate. We conceive of a church as of a building, not for God to re&s;ide, but for men to a&s;&s;emble in; for, though God is a &s;pirit, men have bodies, and they cannot meet to do any thing without having &s;ome place to do it in. Neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jeru&s;alem, means therefore exclu|&s;ively,

with an idea of any peculiar &s;acred|ne&s;s, or &s;uper&s;titious preference to any other &s;tructure which might be equally commodious.</P>
<P>With regard to the character of our Sa|viour him&s;elf, it is certain he did not al|ways call upon his di&s;ciples to &s;hare that more intimate, and, if I may &s;ay &s;o, confi|dential, intercour&s;e with his heavenly Fa|ther, which he may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been favoured with; and it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed, there is no formal mention made of any exerci&s;es of this kind either with them, or with the people at large. But his whole life was a prayer. He, who in his mo&s;t familiar and convivial moments, was rai&s;|ing the thoughts of his hearers to God, and nouri&s;hing their piety by occa&s;ional in|&s;truction, could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to leave them di&s;inclined to the intercour&s;es of &s;o|cial piety. The beautiful commendatory prayer which he offered up when about to leave the world, though it was not en|tirely of the nature of &s;ocial prayer, as his di&s;ciples did not join in it, yet, its being
<PB N="26" REF="30">
uttered in their pre&s;ence, and their being the object of it, &s;eems to place it nearly on the &s;ame ground. In the very miracle of the loaves, which Mr. Wakefield has pro|duced as an in&s;tance of an incident which might have given ri&s;e to public prayer, and which was &s;uffered to pa&s;s without it&mdash;in the account of this very miracle there is a direct precedent for the practice in que&s;tion; for, looking up to heaven, he <HI>ble&s;&s;ed</HI> before he brake the bread. This, indeed, appears to have been his con&s;tant practice. It certainly does not belong to private devotion, and is a &s;pecies of prayer more apt, perhaps, than any other, to de|generate into a mere form.</P>
<P>But if we do not find Public Wor&s;hip, properly &s;o called, in the life of our Saviour, it is becau&s;e we look for it in the wrong place. It is not to be &s;ought for in his in|&s;tructions, either to the multitude at large, or to his di&s;ciples in their more private con|ver&s;ations. This public wor&s;hip was paid where the re&s;t of the Jews paid theirs&mdash;in the Temple. He came up, with the con|cour&s;e
<PB N="27" REF="31">
of a&s;&s;embled multitudes, to the appointed religious fe&s;tivals; he eat the pa&s;&s;over, and a&s;&s;ociated with his fellow ci|tizens, even in tho&s;e rites and that form of wor&s;hip which he knew was &s;o &s;oon to be aboli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Our Lord &s;eems indeed to have been an early and regular frequenter of whatever public wor&s;hip the Jews had among them. What this was, be&s;ides their &s;acrifices and ceremonial ob&s;ervances, Mr. Wakefield is infinitely better able than the author of the&s;e remarks, to collect from the volumes of Rabbinical learning; but, without going deeper into their antiquities than what may be gathered from tho&s;e records of their hi&s;tory which are in the hands of every one, it may be &s;een that verbal addre&s;&s;es to the Divine Being often accompanied the public expre&s;&s;ions of their thank&s;giving. In their earlie&s;t times we have the &s;ong of Mo&s;es, in the burden of which the whole people, led by Miriam, joined in chorus. In a more poli&s;hed age, the fine prayer of Solomon at the dedication of the temple, a
<PB N="28" REF="32">
compo&s;ition which has never been excelled, comes yet nearer to our ideas of an addre&s;s to the Divine Being; and the whole peo|ple bore a part in the wor&s;hip by the re|&s;pon&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"for he is good, for his mercy en|dureth for ever."</Q> A &s;till more regular &s;er|vice is recorded by Nehemiah, when the people, after their return from the captivity, entered into that &s;olemn renewal of their law de&s;cribed with &s;o much affecting &s;o|lemnity. <HI>They &s;tood</HI> and <HI>confe&s;&s;ed their &s;ins,</HI> then <HI>they read the law,</HI> after which the Levites called upon them <HI>to &s;tand up and ble&s;s the Lord their God;</HI> they &s;tood up ac|cordingly, and joined in what I &s;uppo&s;e the author of the Enquiry would call a pretty long prayer. And when <HI>Ezra ble&s;&s;ed the Lord,</HI> the <HI>people an&s;wered, Amen, Amen.</HI> All this is &s;ufficiently &s;imilar not only to the &s;pirit, but to the very routine of our pre&s;ent modes of wor&s;hip. If it be &s;aid, that the&s;e in&s;tances all aro&s;e from peculiar and &s;triking occa&s;ions, it may be an&s;wered, that it is not likely any other would be re|corded; and that the regularity and grace
<PB N="29" REF="33">
with which they &s;eem to have been per|formed, indicate a people not unaccu&s;tom|ed to &s;uch exerci&s;es. Indeed the P&s;alms of David afford every variety which any of our prayers do; confe&s;&s;ion, a&s;cription, thank&s;giving, &amp;c. The&s;e, it &s;hould &s;eem, were many of them &s;et to mu&s;ic, and &s;ung with proper re&s;pon&s;es; for even in the temple, the chief bu&s;ine&s;s of which was not prayer but &s;acrifice, the Levites and other &s;ingers, at the time of the morning and evening &s;acrifice, &s;ung p&s;alms of prai&s;e to God before the altar, and in the conclu|&s;ion the prie&s;ts ble&s;&s;ed the people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Prideaux's Connection, Vol. II. p. 528.</NOTE>. And it is not probable, that in a later period of their hi&s;tory, amid&s;t a greater degree of refinement and cultivation, they &s;hould have contented them&s;elves with mere ri|tual ob&s;ervances. This at lea&s;t is evident, if in the time of our Saviour they had no wor&s;hip &s;imilar to ours, he could not mean by any thing he &s;aid to hint a di&s;like of it; and if they had, he mu&s;t have &s;anctioned the practice by conforming to it. But in|deed
<PB N="30" REF="34">
it is acknowledged by mo&s;t, and Mr. Wakefield &s;eems to admit, that after their return from the Babyloni&s;h captivity, when their hearts were purified by adver&s;ity and more attached to their religion, they had regular and &s;tated wor&s;hip in their &s;yna|gogues, con&s;i&s;ting of forms of prayer, read|ing the &s;criptures, and expounding. In the former, we are told, a mini&s;ter, called from his office the <HI>angel</HI> or <HI>me&s;&s;enger of the church,</HI> officiated as the mouth of the con|gregation; but for the latter part of the &s;ervice it was u&s;ual to call upon any &s;tranger to take his &s;hare, who appeared to be &s;uffi|ciently qualified to read and expound the le&s;&s;ons of the day. And hence probably it was, that our Saviour did not <HI>pray</HI> in the &s;ynagogues, though he often taught there, and interpreted the Scriptures<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Prideaux's Connection, Vol. II. p. 538.</NOTE>. Of their forms of prayer eighteen are given, held to be of high antiquity and peculiar &s;acred|ne&s;s; and the&s;e are in a &s;train not di&s;&s;imilar to the Liturgies of more modern times. In &s;hort, if we trace the accounts given us
<PB N="31" REF="35">
both of the plan of the &s;ervice, and of its pre&s;byters, mini&s;ters, and deacons, it will be found, that the Chri&s;tian church, in its corre&s;ponding officers, its collects, litanies, and expo&s;itions, is the legitimate daughter of the Jewi&s;h &s;ynagogue; and we &s;hall be led to admire the &s;ingular fate of a nation, decreed to be at once imitated and de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Thus much may be &s;ufficient to &s;ay upon a &s;ubject which, after all, is purely a que&s;tion of hi&s;torical curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>To return to the character of our Savi|our. His great bu&s;ine&s;s in the world was in&s;truction; and this he di&s;pen&s;ed, not in a &s;y&s;tematic, but a popular manner; nor yet in a vague and declamatory &s;tile, but in a pointed and appropriated one; not where it would mo&s;t &s;hine, but where it was mo&s;t wanted. He was the great reformer, the innovator of his day; and the &s;train of his energetic eloquence was &s;trongly pointed again&s;t abu&s;es of all kinds, and preci&s;ely tho&s;e points of duty were mo&s;t in&s;i&s;ted on which he found mo&s;t neglected. Almo&s;t all his di&s;cour&s;es are levelled again&s;t &s;ome
<PB N="32" REF="36">
prevailing vice of the times, &s;ome fa&s;hion|able wordly maxim, &s;ome artful glo&s;s of a well known precept, &s;ome eva&s;ion of an acknowledged duty. They were delivered as occa&s;ion prompted, and therefore it was that they came &s;o home to men's bu&s;ine&s;s and bo&s;oms; for he might have delivered the most elaborate lectures on morality, and religion too, without offending the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, if he had confined him&s;elf to &s;y&s;tem, and not attacked cor|ruption. We shall therefore meet with continual di&s;appointment if, in the few &s;cattered di&s;cour&s;es, mo&s;t of them too con|ver&s;ations, which are pre&s;erved to us of our Saviour, we expect to find any thing like a regular code of laws, and &s;till le&s;s a formulary of rules. He referred to known laws, and only endeavoured to re&s;tore the &s;pirit of them, and to exalt the motive of obedience. The great duty of honouring our parents had probably not found a place in his in&s;tructions, but to expo&s;e the <HI>tradi|tion</HI> which had <HI>made it of none effect.</HI> It is therefore a very inconclu&s;ive argument
<PB N="33" REF="37">
again&s;t a practice either, that we are not expre&s;sly enjoined it in the go&s;pel, or that the abu&s;es of it are &s;trongly dwelt upon; and this may &s;erve for a general an&s;wer to Mr. Wakefield's objections built upon the animated denunciations again&s;t tho&s;e who, for a pretence, make long prayers, and who cry, Lord, Lord,&mdash;again&s;t vain repe|titions&mdash;upon the exhortations to wor&s;hip in &s;pirit and in truth&mdash;the declaration that the Sabbath is made for man, and not man for the Sabbath&mdash;with a thou&s;and others in the &s;ame &s;train, with which the go&s;pel undoubtedly abounds. But is the utility of a practice de&s;troyed by the abu&s;e of it, or is it of none, becau&s;e it is not of the chief value? Are none of our duties &s;ubordinate, yet real? or have they all the proud motto, <HI>Aut Coe&s;ar aut nullus.&mdash;</HI>As to the idea of a <HI>progre&s;&s;ive Chri&s;tianity,</HI> on which the author of the Enquiry lays &s;o much &s;tre&s;s, as no new revelation has been pretended &s;ub&s;equent to its original pro|mulgation, it is difficult to conceive of any progre&s;s in it, di&s;tinct from the progre&s;s of
<PB N="34" REF="38">
rea&s;on and civilization in the different coun|tries where it may be received. Now I do not know what right we have to &s;up|po&s;e that the Jews in the time of our Sa|viour, were &s;o gro&s;s in their ideas as to require a mode of wor&s;hip which de&s;erves to be &s;tigmatized with the appellation of <HI>beggarly clements</HI> and the <HI>twilight of &s;uper|&s;tition.</HI> They were probably as different from their countrymen in the time of the Judges, as we are from our ance&s;tors of the Saxon heptarchy. They had long had among them mo&s;t of tho&s;e cau&s;es which tend to develop the mental powers. A &s;y&s;tem of laws and polity, writers of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed excellence, commercial and political intercour&s;e with other nations; they had acute and &s;ubtle di&s;putants, and an acquaintance with different &s;ects of phi|lo&s;ophy; and, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, it is probable that mo&s;t of tho&s;e que&s;tions would be agitated which, at &s;imilar periods, have exerci&s;ed and perplexed the human faculties. Be that as it may, Mr. Wake|field, by con&s;idering public wor&s;hip as a
<PB N="35" REF="39">
practice to be adapted to the <HI>exigencies of the times,</HI> evidently abandons the textual ground, in which narrow path he &s;eemed hitherto to have trod with &s;uch &s;crupulous precaution, and places it on the broader footing of utility. The <HI>utility</HI> of this prac|tice therefore comes next to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>It is an error, which is extremely inci|dent to minds of a delicate and anxious &s;en|&s;ibility, to &s;uppo&s;e that practices do no good which do not all the good that might be expected from them. Let tho&s;e who, in a de&s;ponding mood, are apt to think thus of public wor&s;hip, calculate, if they can, what would be the con&s;equence if it were laid a&s;ide. Perhaps it is not ea&s;y to e&s;timate how much of the manners as well as the morals&mdash;how much of the cul|tivation as well as the religion of a people are derived from this very &s;ource. If a legi&s;lator or philo&s;opher were to undertake the civilization of a horde of wild &s;avages, &s;cattered along the wa&s;te in the drear lone|line&s;s of individual exi&s;tence, and aver&s;e to the faces of each other&mdash;if he had formed
<PB N="36" REF="40">
a plan to gather them together, and give them a principle of cohe&s;ion; he probably could not take a more effectual method than by per&s;uading them to meet together in one place&mdash;at regular and &s;tated times&mdash;and there to join together in a common act, impo&s;ing from its &s;olemnity and endear|ing from the &s;ocial nature of its exerci&s;es. If an adventurer were &s;tranded on &s;ome fo|reign &s;hore, and &s;hould find the inhabitants engaged in &s;uch an act, he might draw the conclu&s;ion, that the ble&s;&s;ings of order, internal peace, mutual confidence, and a con&s;iderable degree of information, exi&s;ted there, as &s;urely as the philo&s;opher drew a &s;imilar inference from the di&s;covery of ma|thematical diagrams traced upon the &s;and. And thus, in fact, it was, that in the early beginnings of &s;ociety, legi&s;lators called in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of religious ideas, and with the charm and melody of &s;olemn hymns, like tho&s;e of Orpheus or of Linus, gathered round them the &s;tupid, incurious barba|rians, rou&s;ed them to attention and &s;oftened into docility. Agreeably to this train of
<PB N="37" REF="41">
thinking, our great dramatic morali&s;t places the influences of &s;ocial wor&s;hip upon a par with the &s;acred touches of &s;ympathetic &s;or|row, and the exhilarating plea&s;ures of the ho&s;pitable board, and makes it one of the features which di&s;tingui&s;h the urbanity of poli&s;hed life from the rude and unfeeling ferocity which belongs to a clan of unprin|cipled banditti.</P>

<P>For, independent of the peculiar object of public religious a&s;&s;emblies, many colla|teral advantages are derived from them which the liberal thinker will by no means de&s;pi&s;e. The recurrence of appointed days of re&s;t and lei&s;ure, which, but for this purpo&s;e, would never have been appointed, divides the weary months of labour and &s;ervitude with a &s;eparating line of a brighter colour. The church is a centre of union for neighbours,
<PB N="38" REF="42">
friends, and town&s;men; and it is a rea&s;on|able and a plea&s;ing ground of preference in our attachments, that we have <Q REND="inline">"walked to the hou&s;e of God in company."</Q> Even the common greetings that pa&s;s between tho&s;e who meet there, are hallowed by the occa&s;ion of the meeting, and the &s;pirit of civic urbanity is mingled with a &s;till &s;weeter infu&s;ion of chri&s;tian courte&s;y. By the recurrence of this intercour&s;e, feuds and animo&s;ities are compo&s;ed, which inter|rupted the harmony of friends and acquaint|ance; and tho&s;e who avoided to meet be|cau&s;e they could not forgive, are led to forgive, being obliged to meet. Its ef|fect in humanizing the lower orders of &s;ociety, and fa&s;hioning their manners to the order and decorum of civil life, is appa|rent to every reflecting mind. The poor who have not formed a habit of attending here, remain from week to week in their &s;ordid cells, or i&s;&s;ue thence to places of licentiou&s;ne&s;s more &s;ordid; while tho&s;e who a&s;&s;emble with the other inhabitants of the place, are brought into the frequent
<PB N="39" REF="43">
view of their &s;uperiors; their per&s;ons are known, their appearance noted; the en|quiring eye of benevolence pur&s;ues them to their humble cottages, and they are not unfrequently led home from &s;ocial wor&s;hip to the &s;ocial meal. If the rich and poor were but thus brought together regularly and univer&s;ally, that &s;ingle circum&s;tance would be found &s;ufficient to remove the &s;qualidne&s;s of mi&s;ery, and the bitterne&s;s of want; and poverty would exi&s;t only as a &s;ober &s;hade in the picture of life, on which the benevolent eye might re&s;t with a degree of complacency when fatigued with the more gaudy colouring of luxury and &s;how.</P>
<P>The good effect of public wor&s;hip in this light is remarkably con&s;picuous in the Sun|day &s;chools. Many of the children who attend, have probably not very clearly comprehended any religious &s;y&s;tem; but the moving and acting under the public eye, together with a &s;en&s;e of duty and mo|ral obligation, which, however ob&s;cure, al|ways accompanies the exerci&s;es of religion, &s;oon transforms them into a different kind
<PB N="40" REF="44">
of beings. They acquire a love of neat|ne&s;s and regularity; a &s;en&s;e of propriety in&s;inuates it&s;elf into their young minds, and produces, in&s;tead of the &s;ullen and untamed licentiou&s;ne&s;s, which at once &s;huns and hates the re&s;traints of better life, the mo|de&s;t deference and cha&s;tened demeanour of tho&s;e who re&s;pect others becau&s;e they re&s;pect them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Public Wor&s;hip conveys a great deal of in&s;truction in an indirect manner. Even tho&s;e didactic prayers which run out into the enumeration of the attributes of the divine Being, and of the duties of a virtuous life, though, perhaps, not &s;trictly proper as prayer, have their u&s;e in &s;toring the minds of the generality with ideas on the&s;e im|portant &s;ubjects; and the beauty and &s;ubli|mity of many of the&s;e compo&s;itions mu&s;t operate powerfully in lifting the heart to God, and in&s;piring it with a love of virtue. Improper as public prayers may have &s;ome|times been, private prayers are likely to be &s;till more &s;o. Whatever contempt Mr. Wakefield may choo&s;e to throw on the
<PB N="41" REF="45">
official abilities of tho&s;e who lead the &s;er|vice, it will not be denied that they are generally better informed than tho&s;e who follow. Men to whom &s;piritual ideas are familiar from reading and &s;tudy, do not &s;ufficiently appreciate the advantage which the illiterate enjoy by the fellow&s;hip and communication of &s;uperior minds, who are qualified to lead their ideas in the right track.</P>
<P>Public Wor&s;hip is a means of invigo|rating faith. Though argument be one means of generating belief, and that on which all belief mu&s;t ultimately re&s;t, it is not the only means, nor, with many minds, the mo&s;t efficacious. Practical faith is greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted by joining in &s;ome act in which the pre&s;ence and per&s;ua&s;ion of others gives a &s;ort of reality to our percep|tion of invi&s;ible things. The metaphy&s;ical rea&s;oner, entangled in the nets of &s;ophi&s;try, may involve him&s;elf in the intricacies of contradictory &s;yllogi&s;ms till rea&s;on grows giddy, and &s;carcely able to hold the balance; but when he acts in pre&s;ence of his fellow-creatures,
<PB N="42" REF="46">
his mind re&s;umes its tone and vigour, and &s;ocial devotion gives a colour and body to the deductions of his rea&s;on. Berkeley, probably, never doubted of the exi&s;tence of the material world when he had quitted his clo&s;et. Some minds are not capable of that firmne&s;s of deci&s;ion which embraces truth upon a bare prepon|derancy of argument&mdash;&s;ome, through a timorous and melancholy &s;pirit, remain al|ways in a perplexed and doubting &s;tate, if they re&s;t merely on the conclu&s;ions built upon their own inve&s;tigation. But every act in con&s;equence of our faith, &s;trengthens faith. The&s;e, when they enter a place of wor&s;hip, amid&s;t all the animating accom|paniments of &s;ocial homage, are &s;eized with a happy contagion; &s;low he&s;itating doubts vani&s;h in a moment, and give way to &s;incere and cordial feeling. The&s;e are not proofs, it is true; but they are helps, adapted to our nature, nece&s;&s;ary to the ge|nerality, expedient for all. As for the multitude, &s;o unaccu&s;tomed are they to any proce&s;s of ab&s;tru&s;e rea&s;oning, and &s;o
<PB N="43" REF="47">
much do they require the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome object within the gra&s;p of their &s;en&s;es, that it is to be doubted whether they could be at all per&s;uaded of the exi&s;tence of a &s;pi|ritual invi&s;ible power, if that exi&s;tence was not &s;tatedly acknowledged by &s;ome act which &s;hould impre&s;s the reality of it upon their minds, by connecting it with places, per&s;ons, and times.</P>
<P>Let it be ob&s;erved, in the next place, that Public Wor&s;hip is a <HI>civic</HI> meeting. The temple is the only place where human be|ings, of every rank and &s;ex and age, meet together for one common purpo&s;e, and join together in one common act. Other meet|ings are either political, or formed for the purpo&s;es of &s;plendor and amu&s;ement; from both which, in this country, the bulk of in|habitants are of nece&s;&s;ity excluded. This is the only place, to enter which nothing more is nece&s;&s;ary than to be of the &s;ame &s;pecies;&mdash;the only place where man meets man not only as an equal but a brother; and where, by contemplating his duties, he may become &s;en&s;ible of his rights. So high
<PB N="44" REF="48">
and haughty is the &s;pirit of ari&s;tocracy, and &s;uch the increa&s;ing pride of the privileged cla&s;&s;es, that it is to be feared, if men did not attend at the &s;ame place here, it would hardly be believed they were meant to go to the &s;ame place hereafter. It is of &s;er|vice to the cau&s;e of freedom therefore, no le&s;s than to that of virtue, that there is one place where the invidious di&s;tinctions of wealth and titles are not admitted; where all are equal, not by making the low, proud, but by making the great, humble. How many a man exi&s;ts who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es not the &s;malle&s;t property in this earth of which you call him lord; who, from the narrow|ing &s;pirit of property, is circum&s;cribed and hemmed in by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of his more opulent neighbours, till there is &s;carcely an unoccupied &s;pot of verdure on which he can &s;et his foot to admire the beauties of nature, or barren mountain on which he can draw the fre&s;h air without a tre&s;pa&s;s. The enjoyments of life are for others, the labours of it for him. He hears tho&s;e of his cla&s;s &s;poken of collectively, as of ma|chines,
<PB N="45" REF="49">
which are to be kept in repair in|deed, but of which the &s;ole u&s;e is to rai&s;e the happine&s;s of the higher orders. Where, but in the temples of religion, &s;hall he learn that he is of the &s;ame &s;pecies? He hears there (and were it for the fir&s;t time, it would be with infinite a&s;toni&s;hment) that all are con&s;idered as alike ignorant and to be in&s;tructed; all alike finful and need|ing forgivene&s;s; all alike bound by the &s;ame obligations, and animated by the &s;ame hopes. In the intercour&s;es of the world the poor man is &s;een, but not noticed; he may be in the pre&s;ence of his &s;uperiors, but he cannot be in their company. In every other place it would be pre&s;umption in him to let his voice be heard along with theirs; here alone they are both rai&s;ed to|gether, and blended in the full chorus of prai&s;e. In every other place it would be an offence to be near them, without &s;hew|ing in his attitudes and deportment the con&s;cious marks of inferiority; here only he &s;ees the pro&s;trations of the rich as low as his, and hears them both addre&s;&s;ed to|gether
<PB N="46" REF="50">
in the maje&s;tic &s;implicity of a lan|guage that knows no adulation. Here the poor man learns that, in &s;pite of the di&s;tinctions of rank, and the apparent in|feriority of his condition, all the true goods of life, all that men dare petition for when in the pre&s;ence of their Maker&mdash;a &s;ound mind, a healthful body, and daily bread, lie within the &s;cope of his own hopes and endeavours; and that in the large inherit|ance to come, his expectations are no le&s;s ample than theirs. He ri&s;es from his knees, and feels him&s;elf a man. He learns philo&s;ophy without its pride, and a &s;pirit of liberty without its turbulence. Every time Social Wor&s;hip is celebrated, it in|cludes a virtual declaration of the rights of man.</P>
<P>It may be further ob&s;erved, that the re|gular &s;ervices of the church are to us the more nece&s;&s;ary, as we have laid a&s;ide many of tho&s;e modes and expre&s;&s;ions which gave a tincture of religion to our &s;ocial inter|cour&s;e and dome&s;tic manners. The regard to particular days and &s;ea&s;ons is nearly worn
<PB N="47" REF="51">
off. The forms of epi&s;tolary corre&s;pond|ence, and the friendly &s;alutations which, in the la&s;t century, breathed a &s;pirit of af|fectionate piety, are exchanged for the degrading ceremonial of unmeaning &s;ervi|lity. The <HI>God be with you&mdash;God ble&s;s you&mdash;If God permit&mdash;Heaven have you in its keeping,&mdash;</HI>like the graceful <HI>Salam,</HI> or &s;alutation of peace among the ea&s;tern na|tions, kept up in the mind a &s;en&s;e of the &s;urrounding providence of the Divine Be|ing, and might, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;uper&s;ede the nece&s;&s;ity of more formal addre&s;&s;es; whereas, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety, a &s;tranger might pa&s;s day after day, and week after week, in the bo&s;om of a Chri&s;tian country, without &s;u&s;pecting the faith of its inhabitants (if Public Wor&s;hip were laid a&s;ide) from any circum&s;tance, unle&s;s it were the ob&s;cure, half-pronounced ble&s;&s;ing which is &s;till &s;ometimes murmured over the table.</P>
<P>Let it therefore be con&s;idered, when the length and ab&s;tracted nature of our public prayers is objected to, that we have no|thing to take their place. If our attention
<PB N="48" REF="52">
was excited by proce&s;&s;ions, garlands, altars, and &s;acrifices, and every action of our lives intermixed with &s;ome religious rite, the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of our homage might be more readily di&s;pen&s;ed with; but in reality, te|dious as Mr. Wakefield may think long prayers, they &s;uit better with the gravity of the national di&s;po&s;ition and the philo&s;ophic turn of our ideas, than any &s;ub&s;titute which could be &s;ugge&s;ted by the mo&s;t cla&s;|&s;ic ta&s;te. Our prayers are become long, becau&s;e our ceremonies are &s;hort.</P>
<P>If we may &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e views of the &s;ubject to have e&s;tabli&s;hed the general uti|lity of Public Wor&s;hip, a que&s;tion &s;till ari&s;es, Is the obligation to it univer&s;al? Is attend|ance on its exerci&s;es to be expected from tho&s;e who&s;e own minds are temples more hallowed than any they can enter; and who&s;e knowledge and cultivation render it probable, that in every popular &s;ervice they will meet with much to object to, and lit|tle to intere&s;t a ta&s;te rendered fa&s;tidious by critical accuracy and elegant refinement? Without pre&s;uming to condemn the con|duct of tho&s;e who are in every re&s;pect &s;o
<PB N="49" REF="53">
competent to form their own plans ac|cording to their own judgment, I would mention &s;ome con&s;iderations which, even to them, may pre&s;ent it in a light not un|worthy their attention. It is, in the fir&s;t place, an act of homage, and as &s;uch equally incumbent on all. It is a profe&s;&s;ion of faith, le&s;s dubious even than the perform|ance of moral duties, which may proceed from a well directed prudence, or the har|mony of a happy temperament. It is right and proper that Religion &s;hould have the honour of tho&s;e who are calculated to do her honour. It is likewi&s;e u&s;eful for a pious man to be connected with pious peo|ple as &s;uch. Various a&s;&s;ociations are form|ed upon the ground of &s;omething which men wi&s;h to improve or to enjoy in com|mon. Literary men a&s;&s;ociate, mu&s;ical men a&s;&s;ociate, political men a&s;&s;ociate together; and as there is a great deal of the commerce of the world in which it would be impo&s;&s;i|ble to introduce religion, there ought by way of balance to be &s;ome &s;ociety of which that is the ground and principle; other|wi&s;e,
<PB N="50" REF="54">
from the very nature of our connec|tions with each other, we &s;hall find reli|gion le&s;s in our thoughts than almo&s;t any thing el&s;e in which we have an intere&s;t, and in&s;en&s;ibly it will wa&s;te and die away for mere want of aliment. But the at|tendance of men of literature and know|ledge is perhaps mo&s;t important from its effect upon others. The unenlightened wor&s;hip with mo&s;t plea&s;ure, where tho&s;e wor&s;hip who&s;e opinions they re&s;pect. A religion that is left for the vulgar will not long &s;atisfy even them. There is har&s;h|ne&s;s in &s;aying to the bulk of mankind, Stand a&s;ide, we are wi&s;er than you. There is har&s;hne&s;s in &s;aying, Our affections can|not move in concert; what edifies you di&s;|gu&s;ts us; we cannot feel in common, even where we have a common intere&s;t. In the intercour&s;es of life, the man of urbanity makes a thou&s;and &s;acrifices to the conci|liating &s;pirit of courte&s;y, and the &s;cience of attentions. The exerci&s;es of devotion, Mr. Wakefield &s;ays, are weari&s;ome. Sup|po&s;e they were &s;o, how many meetings do
<PB N="51" REF="55">
we frequent, to how many conver&s;ations do we li&s;ten with benevolent attention, where our own plea&s;ure and our own im|provement are not the objects to which our time is given up? He who knows much, mu&s;t expect to be often pre&s;ent where he can learn nothing. While others are re|ceiving information, he is practi&s;ing a vir|tue. He, who in common life has learned to mix a regard to the feelings and opinions of others with the pur&s;uit of his own gra|tifications, will bear, in the &s;pirit of love and charity, the in&s;truction which to him is unnece&s;&s;ary, the amplification which to him is tire&s;ome, the deficiencies of me|thod or of elocution, to which his ear and his judgment are acutely &s;en&s;ible; the im|perfections, in &s;hort, of men or of &s;ocieties inferior to him&s;elf in ta&s;te or knowledge;&mdash;as in conver&s;ation he bears with the communi|cative overflowings of &s;elf-importance, the repetition of the well known tale, and the recurrence of the numerous, burden&s;ome forms of civilized &s;ociety.</P>
<P>It becomes us well to con&s;ider what
<PB N="52" REF="56">
would be the con&s;equence, if the de&s;ertion of men of &s;uperior &s;en&s;e &s;hould become ge|neral in our a&s;&s;emblies. Not the abolition of public wor&s;hip; it is a practice too deeply rooted in the very propen&s;ities of our nature; but this would be the con&s;e|quence, that it would be thrown into the hands of profe&s;&s;ional men on the one hand, and of uninformed men on the other. By the one it would be corrupted, it would be deba&s;ed by the other. Let the friends of moderation and good &s;en&s;e con&s;ider whe|ther it is de&s;irable, whether it is even &s;afe, to withdraw from the public the powerful influence of their ta&s;te, knowledge, and liberality. Let them con&s;ider whether they are prepared to take the con&s;equences of tru&s;ting in the hands of any clergy, &s;o powerful an engine as that of public wor|&s;hip and in&s;truction, without the &s;alutary check of <HI>their</HI> pre&s;ence who are be&s;t able to di&s;tingui&s;h truth from fal&s;ehood, to de|tect unwarrantable preten&s;ions, and to keep within tolerable bounds the wanderings of fanatici&s;m. Attentive to the &s;igns of the
<PB N="53" REF="57">
times, they will have remarked, on the one hand, a di&s;po&s;ition to give into deception, greater than might naturally have been pre&s;umed of this age, which we compli|ment with the epithet of enlightened. Empiric extravagancies have been adopted, which violate every &s;ober and con&s;i&s;tent idea of the laws of nature, and new &s;ects have &s;prung up di&s;tingui&s;hed by the wilde&s;t reveries of vi&s;ionary credulity. On the other, they will have ob&s;erved indications of a de&s;ire to di&s;courage the freedom of in|ve&s;tigation, to thicken the veil of my&s;tery, and to revive every ob&s;olete preten&s;ion of prie&s;tly power, which, in the mo&s;t ignorant periods, the haughtie&s;t churchman has ever dared to a&s;&s;ume. They will have read with a&s;toni&s;hment an official exhortation to the inferior clergy&mdash;it was not fulmi|nated from the Vatican, it was not dragged to light from the mould and ru&s;t of remote ages&mdash;It was delivered by an Engli&s;h divine of the eighteenth century, brilliant in parts and high in place: he knew it was to meet the notice and encounter the critici&s;m of an

He has re|vived claims and opinions which have upon their heads whole centuries of oblivion and contempt; and by &s;landering Morality, has thought to exalt Religion.&mdash;Reflecting on the&s;e things, they will con&s;ider whether the man of judgment does not de&s;ert the po&s;t a&s;&s;igned him by Providence, when he withdraws from popular a&s;&s;emblies both the countenance of his example and the impo&s;ing awe of his pre&s;ence; they will conceive them&s;elves as inve&s;ted with the high commi&s;&s;ion to take care <HI>nequid re&s;-publica detrimenti capiat;</HI> they will con&s;i|der

them&s;elves as the &s;alt of the earth, the leaven of the lump, not to be &s;ecluded in &s;eparate parcels, but to be mingled in the whole ma&s;s, diffu&s;ing through it their own &s;pirit and &s;avour.</P>
<P>The author of the Enquiry choo&s;es to expatiate, it is not difficult to do it, on the di&s;cordant variety of the different modes of wor&s;hip practi&s;ed among&s;t men, and con|cludes it with characterizing this alarming &s;chi&s;m by the compari&s;on of the poet:<Q><L>One likes the phea&s;ant's wing, and one the leg;</L>
<L>The vulgar boil, the learned roa&s;t an egg.</L></Q></P>
<P>But might we not venture to a&s;k,&mdash;Where, pray, is the harm of all this? un|le&s;s indeed I will not allow my neighbour to boil his egg becau&s;e I roa&s;t mine. Eggs are good and nutritious food either way; and in the manner of dre&s;&s;ing them, fancy and ta&s;te, nay caprice, if you will, may fairly be con&s;ulted. If I prefer the leg of a phea&s;ant, and my neighbour finds it dry, let each take what he likes. It would be a conclu&s;ion &s;ingularly ab&s;urd that eggs and
<PB N="56" REF="60">
phea&s;ants were not to be eaten. All the harm is in having but one table for gue&s;ts of every de&s;cription; and yet even there, were I at a public ordinary, good in other re&s;pects, I would rather conform my ta&s;te in &s;ome mea&s;ure to that of my neighbour, than be reduced to the melancholy nece&s;|&s;ity of eating my mor&s;el by my&s;elf alone.</P>
<P>The Di&s;&s;enters cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to pa&s;s over in &s;ilence Mr. Wakefield's &s;tric|tures upon the manner in which <HI>they</HI> have cho&s;en to conduct their public and &s;ocial wor&s;hip. They are &s;urpri&s;ed and &s;orry to find them&s;elves treated with &s;uch a mix|ture of bitterne&s;s and levity by a man who&s;e abilities they re&s;pect, and whom they have &s;hewn them&s;elves ready to em|brace as a brother. They have their pre|judices, they acknowledge&mdash;and he per|haps has his. Many forms and ob&s;erv|ances may to them be dear and venerable, through the force of early habit and a&s;&s;o|ciation, which to a &s;tranger in their I&s;rael may appear uncouth, unnece&s;&s;ary, or even marked with a &s;hade of ridicule. They
<PB N="57" REF="61">
pity Mr. Wakefield's peculiar and in&s;ulated &s;ituation. Separating through the pure&s;t motives from one church, he has not found another with which he is inclined to a&s;&s;ociate; divided by difference of opi|nions from one cla&s;s of Chri&s;tians, and by di&s;&s;onance of ta&s;te from another, he finds the tran&s;ition too violent from the college to the conventicle; he wor&s;hips alone be|cau&s;e he &s;tands alone; and is, naturally perhaps, led to undervalue that fellow&s;hip which has been lo&s;t to him between his early predilections and his later opinions. If, however, the Di&s;&s;enters are not &s;o hap|py as to gain his affection, they mu&s;t be allowed to urge their claims upon his e&s;teem. They wi&s;h him to reflect, that neither his cla&s;&s;ical knowledge, nor his critical acumen, nor his acknowledged ta|lents, &s;et him &s;o high in the e&s;teem of good men, as that integrity which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in common with tho&s;e whom he de&s;pi&s;es; they believe further con&s;idera|tion would &s;ugge&s;t to him, that it were more can did to pa&s;s over tho&s;e peculiari|ties
<PB N="58" REF="62">
which have originated in a delicate con&s;cience and the fervour of devotion; and they cannot help a&s;king, Whether they had rea&s;on to expect the &s;everity of &s;arca&s;|tic ridicule from him, who&s;e be&s;t prai&s;e it is that he has imitated their virtues and &s;hared their &s;acrifices?</P>
<P>The Di&s;&s;enters, however, do not make it their boa&s;t that they have nothing to re|form. They have, perhaps, always been more con&s;picuous for principle than for ta&s;te; their practices are founded upon a prevalence of religious fervour, an anima|tion and warmth of piety, which, if it no longer exi&s;ts, it is vain to &s;imulate. But what they do make their boa&s;t is, that they acknowledge no principle which forbids them to reform; that they have no leave to a&s;k of Bi&s;hops, Synods, or Parliaments, in order to lay a&s;ide forms which have become vapid. They are open to conviction; they are ready to receive with thankfulne&s;s every <HI>&s;ober</HI> and <HI>liberal</HI> remark which may a&s;&s;i&s;t them to improve their religious ad|dre&s;&s;es, and model them to the temper of
<PB N="59" REF="63">
the public mind. But, with regard to tho&s;e practices of &s;uperabundant devotion which have drawn down upon them the indig|nation of the critic, it is the opinion of tho&s;e who be&s;t know the Di&s;&s;enters of the pre&s;ent day, that they might have been &s;uffered to fall quietly of them&s;elves: they are &s;upported by no authority, defrayed by no impo&s;t. If they make long prayers, it is at the expence only of their own breath and &s;pirits; no widows' hou&s;es are devour|ed by it. If the pre&s;ent generation <HI>yawn</HI> and <HI>&s;lumber</HI> over the exerci&s;es which their fathers attended with pious alacrity, the &s;ons will of cour&s;e learn to &s;horten them. If the di&s;po&s;ition of their public &s;ervices wants animation, as perhaps it does, the &s;ilent pews will be de&s;erted one by one, and they will be obliged to &s;eek &s;ome other mode of engaging the attention of their audience. But modes and forms af|fect not the e&s;&s;ence of Public Wor&s;hip; that may be performed with a form or without one; by words alone, or by &s;ym|bolical expre&s;&s;ions, combined with or &s;epa|rated
<PB N="60" REF="64">
from in&s;truction; with or without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a particular order appoint|ed to officiate in leading the devotions: it may be celebrated one day in &s;even, or in eight, or in ten: in many of the&s;e parti|culars a certain deference &s;hould be had to the &s;entiments of that &s;ociety with which, upon the whole, we think it be&s;t to con|nect our&s;elves, and as times and manners change, the&s;e circum&s;tances will vary; but the root of the practice is too &s;trongly in|terwoven with the texture of the human frame ever to be abandoned. While man has wants, he will pray; while he is &s;en&s;i|ble of ble&s;&s;ings, he will offer prai&s;e; while he has common wants and common ble&s;&s;|ings, he will pray and prai&s;e in company with his fellows; and while he feels him|&s;elf a &s;ocial being, he will not be per&s;uaded to lay a&s;ide Social Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t, however, be acknowledged, that, in order to give Public Wor&s;hip all the grace and efficacy of which it is &s;u&s;ceptible, much alteration is nece&s;&s;ary. It is nece&s;&s;ary here, as in every other concern, that timely re|formation
<PB N="61" REF="65">
&s;hould prevent neglect. Much might be done by judgment, ta&s;te, and a devotional &s;pirit united, to improve the plan of our religious a&s;&s;emblies. Should a ge|nius ari&s;e among&s;t us qualified for &s;uch a ta&s;k, and in circum&s;tances favourable to his being li&s;tened to, he would probably remark fir&s;t, on the con&s;truction of our churches, &s;o ill adapted are a great part of them to the purpo&s;es either of hearing or &s;eeing. He would reprobate tho&s;e little gloomy &s;olitary cells, planned by the &s;pirit of ari&s;tocracy, which deform the building no le&s;s to the eye of ta&s;te than to the eye of benevolence, and in&s;ulating each family within its &s;eparate inclo&s;ure, favour at once the pride of rank and the lazine&s;s of in|dulgence. He might choo&s;e for the&s;e &s;tructures &s;omething of the amphitheatrical form, where the mini&s;ter, on a rai&s;ed plat|form, &s;hould be beheld with ea&s;e by the whole wave of people, at once bending to|gether in deep humiliation, or &s;preading forth their hands in the earne&s;tne&s;s of pe|tition. It would certainly be found de&s;ir|able
<PB N="62" REF="66">
that the people &s;hould them&s;elves have a large &s;hare in the performance of the &s;er|vice, as the intermixture of their voices would both introduce more variety and greater animation; provided pains were ta|ken by proper teaching to enable them to bear their part with a decorum and pro|priety, which, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, we do not &s;ee at pre&s;ent among&s;t tho&s;e who&s;e public &s;ervices po&s;&s;e&s;s the advantage of re|&s;pon&s;es. The explaining, and teaching them to recite, &s;uch hymns and collects as it might be thought proper they &s;hould bear a part in, would form a plea&s;ing and u&s;e|ful branch of the in&s;truction of young peo|ple, and of the lower cla&s;&s;es; it would give them an intere&s;t in the public &s;ervice, and might fill up agreeably a vacant hour either on the Sunday or on &s;ome other lei&s;ure day, e&s;pecially if they were likewi&s;e regularly in&s;tructed in &s;inging for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. As we have never &s;een, perhaps we can hardly conceive, the effect which the unit|ed voices of a whole congregation, all in the lively expre&s;&s;ion of one feeling, would
<PB N="63" REF="67">
have upon the mind. We &s;hould then per|ceive not only that we were doing the &s;ame thing in the &s;ame place, but that we were doing it with one accord. The deep &s;ilence of li&s;tening expectation, the bur&s;t of united prai&s;es, the &s;olemn pau&s;es that invite re|flection, the varied tones of humiliation, gratitude, or per&s;ua&s;ion, would &s;well and melt the heart by turns; nor would there be any rea&s;on to guard again&s;t the wander|ing eye, when every object it re&s;ted on mu&s;t forcibly recall it to the duties of the place.&mdash;Po&s;&s;ibly it might be found expedi|ent to &s;eparate wor&s;hip from in&s;truction; the learned teacher from the leader of the public devotions, in whom voice, and po|pular talents, might perhaps be allowed to &s;uper&s;ede a more deep and critical acquaint|ance with the doctrines of theology. One con&s;equence, at lea&s;t, would follow &s;uch a &s;eparation, that in&s;truction would be given more &s;y&s;tematically.&mdash;Nothing that is taught at all is taught in &s;o vague and de|&s;ultory a manner as the doctrines of re|ligion. A congregation may attend for
<PB N="64" REF="68">
years, even a good preaoher, and never hear the evidences of either natural or revealed religion regularly explained to them: they may attend for years, and never hear a con|nected &s;y&s;tem of moral duties extending to the different &s;ituations and relations of life: they may attend for years, and not even gain any clear idea of the hi&s;tory and chro|nology of the Old and New Te&s;tament, which are read to them every Sunday. They will hear abundance of excellent doctrine, and will often feel their hearts warmed and their minds edified; but their ideas upon the&s;e &s;ubjects will be confu&s;ed and imperfect, becau&s;e they are treated on in a manner &s;o totally different from every thing el&s;e which bears the name of in&s;truc|tion. This is probably owing, in a great mea&s;ure, to the cu&s;tom of prefixing to every pulpit di&s;cour&s;e a &s;entence, taken indi&s;cri|minately from any part of the Scriptures, under the name of a text, which at fir&s;t implying an expo&s;ition, was afterwards u&s;ed to &s;ugge&s;t, a &s;ubject, and is now, by degrees, dwindling into a motto.&mdash;Still,
<PB N="65" REF="69">
however, the cu&s;tom &s;ub&s;i&s;ts; and while it &s;erves to &s;uper&s;ede a more methodical cour&s;e of in&s;truction, tends to keep up in the minds of the generality of hearers a very &s;uper&s;titious idea, not now entertain|ed, it is to be pre&s;umed, by the generality of tho&s;e who teach, of the equal &s;acredne&s;s and importance of every part of &s;o mi&s;cel|laneous a collection.</P>
<P>If the&s;e in&s;ulated di&s;cour&s;es, of which each is complete in it&s;elf, and therefore can have but little compa&s;s, were dige&s;ted into a regular plan of lectures, &s;upported by a cour&s;e of reading, to which the au|dience might be directed, it would have the further advantage of rou&s;ing the inattentive and re&s;training the rambling hearer by the intere&s;t which would be created by &s;uch a connected &s;eries of information. They would occupy a larger &s;pace in the mind, they would more frequently be the &s;ubject of recollec|tion and meditation; there would be a fear of mi&s;&s;ing one link in &s;uch a chain of truths, and the more intelligent part of a congre|gation might find a u&s;eful and intere&s;ting
<PB N="66" REF="70">
employment in a&s;&s;i&s;ting the teacher in the in&s;truction of tho&s;e who were not able to comprehend in&s;truction with the &s;ame fa|cility as them&s;elves. When &s;uch a cour&s;e of in&s;truction had been delivered, it would not be expected that di&s;cour&s;es, into which men of genius and learning had dige&s;ted their be&s;t thoughts, &s;hould be thrown by, or brought forward again, as it were, by &s;tealth; but they would be regularly and avowedly repeated at proper intervals. It is u&s;ual upon the continent for a &s;et of &s;er|mons to be delivered in &s;everal churches, each of which has its officiating mini&s;ter for the &s;tated public wor&s;hip; and thus a whole di&s;trict partakes the advantage of the labours of a man eminent for compo&s;i|tion. Perhaps it might be de&s;irable to join to religious information &s;ome in&s;truction in the laws of our country, which are, or ought to be, founded upon morals; and which, by a &s;trange &s;oleci&s;m, are obliga|tory upon all, and &s;carcely promulgated, much le&s;s explained.&mdash;Many ideas will of|fer them&s;elves to a thinking man, who
<PB N="67" REF="71">
wi&s;hes not to aboli&s;h, but to improve the Public Wor&s;hip of his country. The&s;e are only hints, offered with diffidence and re&s;pect, to tho&s;e who are able to judge of and carry them into effect.</P>
<P>Above all, it would be de&s;irable to &s;epa|rate from religion that idea of gloom which in this country has but too generally ac|companied it. The fact cannot be denied; the cau&s;e mu&s;t be &s;ought, partly in our national character, which I am afraid is not naturally either very cheerful or very &s;ocial, and which we &s;hall do well to meliorate by every po&s;&s;ible attention to our habits of life;&mdash;and partly to the colour of our reli|gious &s;y&s;tems. No one who embraces the common idea of future torments, together with the doctrine of election and reproba|tion, the in&s;ufficiency of virtue to e&s;cape the <HI>wrath</HI> of God, and the &s;trange ab|&s;urdity which, it &s;hould &s;eem, through &s;imilarity of &s;ound alone has been admitted as an axiom, that &s;ins committed again&s;t an Infinite Being do therefore de&s;erve in|finite puni&s;hment&mdash;no one, I will venture
<PB N="68" REF="72">
to a&s;&s;ert, can believe &s;uch tenets, and have them often in his thoughts, and yet be cheerful. Whence a &s;y&s;tem has ari&s;en &s;o incompatible with that ju&s;tice and benevo|lence, which in the di&s;cour&s;es of our Sa|viour are repre&s;ented as the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential attributes of the Divine Being, is not ea&s;y to trace. It is probable, however, that <HI>power,</HI> being the mo&s;t prominent feature in our conceptions of the Creator, and that of which we &s;ee the mo&s;t &s;triking image here on earth (there being a greater por|tion of uncontrouled power than of un|mixed wi&s;dom or goodne&s;s to be found among&s;t human beings), the Deity would naturally be likened to an ab&s;olute mo|narch;&mdash;and mo&s;t ab&s;olute monarchs hav|ing been tyrants, jealous of their &s;overeign|ty, aver&s;e to freedom of inve&s;tigation, order|ing affairs, not with a view to the happi|ne&s;s of their &s;ubjects, but to the advance|ment of their own glory; not to be ap|proached but with rich gifts and offerings; be&s;towing favours, not in proportion to merit, but from the pure influence of ca|price
<PB N="69" REF="73">
and blind partiality; to tho&s;e who have offended them &s;evere, and unforgiving, ex|cept induced to pardon by the importunate interce&s;&s;ion of &s;ome favourite; confining their enemies, when they had overcome them, after a conte&s;t, in deep, dark dun|geons under ground, or putting them to death in the prolonged mi&s;ery of excruci|ating tortures&mdash;the&s;e features of human depravity have been mo&s;t faithfully tran&s;|ferred to the Supreme Being; and men have imaged to them&s;elves how a Nero or a Domitian would have acted, if, from the extent of their dominion there had been no e&s;cape, and to the duration of it no period.</P>
<P>The&s;e ideas of the vulgar belief, terri|ble, but as yet vague and undefined, pa&s;&s;ed into the &s;peculations of the &s;choolmen, by whom they were combined with the me|taphy&s;ical idea of eternity, arranged in &s;pecific propo&s;itions, fixed in creeds, and elaborated into &s;y&s;tems, till at length they have been &s;ublimed into all the tremendous horrors of the Calvini&s;tic faith. The&s;e doctrines, it is true, among thinking peo|ple,
<PB N="70" REF="74">
are lo&s;ing ground; but there is &s;till apparent, in that cla&s;s called &s;erious Chri&s;|tians, a tenderne&s;s in expo&s;ing them; a &s;ort of leaning towards them, as in walk|ing over a precipice one &s;hould lean to the &s;afe&s;t &s;ide; an idea that they are, if not true, at lea&s;t good to be believed, and that a &s;alutary error is better than a dangerous truth. But that error can neither be &s;a|lutary nor harmle&s;s, which attributes to the Deity inju&s;tice and cruelty; and that religion mu&s;t have the wor&s;t of tendencies, which renders it dangerous for man to imi|tate the being whom he wor&s;hips. Let tho&s;e who hold &s;uch tenets con&s;ider, that the invi&s;ible Creator has no name, and is identified only by his character; and they will tremble to think <HI>what</HI> being they are wor&s;hipping, when they invoke a power ca|pable of producing exi&s;tence, in order to continue it in never ending torments. The God of the A&s;&s;embly's Catechi&s;m is not the <HI>&s;ame</HI> God with the deity of Thom&s;on's Sea&s;ons, and of Hutche&s;on's Ethics. Uni|ty of character in what we adore, is much
<PB N="71" REF="75">
more e&s;&s;ential than unity of per&s;on. We often boa&s;t, and with rea&s;on, of the purity of our religion, as oppo&s;ed to the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of the theology of the Greeks and Ro|mans; but we &s;hould remember, that cru|elty is as much wor&s;e than licentiou&s;ne&s;s, as a Moloch is wor&s;e than a &s;atyr.&mdash;When will Chri&s;tians permit them&s;elves to believe that the &s;ame conduct which gains them the approbation of good men here, will &s;e|cure the favour of heaven hereafter? When will they cea&s;e making their court to their Maker by the &s;ame &s;ervile deba&s;ement and affectation of lowline&s;s by which the vain potentates of the earth are flattered? When a harmle&s;s and well meaning man, in the exaggerated figures of theological rhetoric, calls him&s;elf the vile&s;t of &s;inners, it is in preci&s;ely the &s;ame &s;pirit of fal&s;e humility in which the courtier u&s;es degrading and di&s;|qualifying expre&s;&s;ions, when he &s;peaks of him&s;elf in his adulatory addre&s;&s;es to his &s;o|vereign. When a good man draws near the clo&s;e of a life, not free indeed from faults, but pure from crime, a life &s;pent
<PB N="72" REF="76">
in the habitual exerci&s;e of all tho&s;e virtues which adorn and dignify human nature, and in the uniform approach to that per|fection, which is confe&s;&s;edly unattainable in this imperfect &s;tate,&mdash;when a man&mdash;perhaps like Dr. Price, who&s;e name will be ever pronounced with affectionate ve|neration and deep regard by all the friends of philo&s;ophy, virtue, and mankind,&mdash;is about to re&s;ign his &s;oul into the hands of his Maker, he ought to do it, not only with a reliance on his mercy, but his ju&s;|tice; a generous confidence and pious re|&s;ignation &s;hould be blended in his deport|ment. It does not become him to pay the bla&s;phemous homage of deprecating the wrath of God, when he ought to throw him&s;elf into the arms of his love. He is not to think that virtue is one thing here, and another in heaven; or that he on whom ble&s;&s;ings and eulogiums are ready to bur&s;t from all hone&s;t tongues, can be an object of puni&s;hment with him who is infinitely more benevolent than any of his creatures.</P>
<P>The&s;e remarks may be thought foreign
<PB N="73" REF="77">
to the &s;ubject in que&s;tion; but in fact they are not &s;o. Public Wor&s;hip will be tinctured with gloom, while our ideas of its object are darkened by &s;uper&s;tition; it will be in|fected with hypocri&s;y, while its profe&s;&s;ions and tenets run counter to the genuine, un|perverted moral &s;en&s;e of mankind; it will not meet the countenance of philo&s;ophers &s;o long as we are obliged to unlearn our ethics, in order to learn divinity. Let it be con&s;idered that the&s;e opinions greatly favour immorality. The doctrine that all are vile, and equally merit a &s;tate of pu|ni&s;hment, is an idea as con&s;olatory to the profligate, as it is humiliating to the &s;aint; and that is one rea&s;on why it has always been a favourite doctrine. The indecent confidence of a Dodd<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'And admitted, as I tru&s;t I &s;hall be, to the realms of bli&s;s before you, I &s;hall hail your arrival there with tran&s;port, and rejoice to acknowledge that you was my comforter, my advocate, and my friend.'</Q>

than he, &s;pring from one and the &s;ame &s;ource. It prevents the genuine workings of real penitence, by enjoining confe&s;&s;ions of imaginary demerit; it quenches reli|gious gratitude, becau&s;e conceiving only of two &s;tates of retribution, both in the ex|treme, and feeling that our crimes, what|ever they may be, cannot have de&s;erved the one, we are not &s;ufficiently thankful for the pro&s;pect of the other, which we look upon as only a nece&s;&s;ary alternative. La&s;tly, it di&s;&s;olves the connection between religion and common life, by introducing a &s;et of phra&s;es and a &s;tandard of moral feeling, totally different from tho&s;e ideas of prai&s;e and blame, merit and demerit, upon which we do and mu&s;t act in our commerce with our fellow creatures.</P>
<P>There are periods in which the human mind &s;eems to &s;lumber, but this is not one of them. A keen &s;pirit of re&s;earch is now abroad, and demands reform. Perhaps in none of the nations of Europe will their articles of faith, or their church-e&s;tabli&s;h|ments, or their modes of wor&s;hip, be able
<PB N="75" REF="79">
to maintain their ground for many years in exactly the &s;ame po&s;ition in which they &s;tand at pre&s;ent. Religion and manners re|ciprocally act upon one another. As reli|gion, well under&s;tood, is a mo&s;t powerful agent in meliorating and &s;oftening our man|ners; &s;o, on the other hand, manners, as they advance in cultivation, tend to cor|rect and refine our religion. Thus, to a nation in any degree acquainted with the &s;ocial feelings, human &s;acrifices, and &s;an|guinary rites, could never long appear obli|gatory. The mild &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity has, no doubt, had its influence in &s;often|ing the ferocity of the Gothic times; and the increa&s;ing humanity of the pre&s;ent pe|riod will, in its turn, produce ju&s;ter ideas of Chri&s;tianity, and diffu&s;e through the &s;o|lemnities of our wor&s;hip, the celebration of our &s;abbaths, and every ob&s;ervance con|nected with religion, that air of amenity and &s;weetne&s;s, which is the offspring of literature, and the peaceful intercour&s;es of &s;ociety. The age which has demoli&s;hed dungeons, rejected torture, and given &s;o
<PB N="76" REF="80" MS="y">
fair a pro&s;pect of aboli&s;hing the iniquity of the &s;lave trade, cannot long retain among its articles of belief the gloomy perplexities of Calvini&s;m, and the heart-withering per|&s;pective of cruel and never-ending puni&s;h|ments.</P>
