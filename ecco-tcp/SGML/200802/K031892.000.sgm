<HEAD>To His Grace <HI>PHILIP,</HI> DUKE and MARQUIS of <HI>WHARTON,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IT has ever been the Cu&s;tom of Poets to &s;helter Pro|ductions of this Nature un|der the Patronage of the brighte&s;t Men of their Time; and 'tis ob&s;erv'd, that the Mu&s;es al|ways met the kinde&s;t Reception from Per&s;ons of the greate&s;t Merit. The World will do me Ju&s;tice as to the Choice of my Patron, but will, I fear,
<PB REF="4">
blame my ra&s;h Attempt, in daring to Addre&s;s Your Grace, and offer at a Work too difficult for our able&s;t Pens, <HI>viz.</HI> an Encomium on Your Grace: I have no Plea again&s;t &s;uch ju&s;t Re|flections, but the Di&s;advantage of E|ducation, and the Privilege of my Sex.</P>
<P>If Your Grace di&s;covers a Genius &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing in this Dawn of Life, what mu&s;t your riper Years produce? Your Grace has already been di&s;tingui&s;h'd in a mo&s;t peculiar Manner, being the fir&s;t Young Nobleman that ever was admit|ted into a Hou&s;e of Peers before he reached the Age of One and Twenty: But Your Grace's Judgment and Elo|quence &s;oon convinced that Augu&s;t A&s;&s;embly, that the excelling Gifts of Nature ought not to be confin'd to Time. We hope the Example which <HI>Ireland</HI> has &s;et, will &s;hortly be followed by an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hou&s;e of Lords, and Your Grace made a Member of that Body, to which You will be &s;o Con|&s;picuous an Ornament.</P>
<P>Your good Sen&s;e, and real Love for your Country, taught Your Grace to per&s;evere in the Principles of your Glo|rious
<PB REF="5">
Ance&s;tors, by adhering to the Defender of our Religion and Laws: and the penetrating Wi&s;dom of Your Royal Ma&s;ter, &s;aw you merited your Honours ere he conferr'd them. It is one of the greate&s;t Glories of a Mo|narch, to di&s;tingui&s;h where to be&s;tow his Favours; and the World mu&s;t do ours Ju&s;tice, by owning Your Grace's Titles mo&s;t de&s;ervedly worn.</P>
<P>It is with the greate&s;t Plea&s;ure ima|ginable the Friends of Liberty &s;ee You pur&s;uing the Steps of Your Noble Fa|ther: Your Courteous, Affable Tem|per, free from Pride and O&s;tentation, makes Your Name ador'd in the Coun|try, and enables Your Grace to carry what Point You plea&s;e. The late Lord <HI>Wharton</HI> will be &s;till remember'd by every Lover of his Country, which ne|ver felt a greater Shock than what his Death occa&s;ion'd: Their Grief had been incon&s;olable, if Heaven, out of its won|ted Beneficence to this Favourite I&s;le, had not tran&s;mitted all his &s;hining Qualities to you, and Phenix like, rai&s;ed up one Patriot out of the A&s;hes of a|nother.</P>
<P><PB REF="6">
That Your Grace has a high E&s;teem for Learning, particularly appears by the large Progre&s;s you have made therein: and your Love for the Mu&s;es &s;hews a Sweetne&s;s of Temper, and Ge|nerous Humanity, peculiar to the Great|ne&s;s of Your Soul; for &s;uch Virtues reign not in the Brea&s;t of every Man of Quality.</P>
<P>Defer no longer then, my Lord, to charm the World with the Beauty of your Numbers, and &s;hew the Poet, as you have done the Orator; convince our unthinking <HI>Britous,</HI> by what vile Arts <HI>France</HI> lo&s;t her Liberty; and teach 'em to avoid their own Misfortunes, as well as to weep over <HI>Henry</HI> IV. who (if it were po&s;&s;ible for him to know) would forgive the bold A&s;&s;a&s;&s;in's Hand, for the Honour of having his Fall celebrated by Your Grace's Pen.</P>
<P>To be di&s;tingui&s;h'd by Per&s;ons of Your Grace's Character, is not only the highe&s;t Ambition, but the greate&s;t Re|putation to an Author; and it is not the lea&s;t of my Vanities, to have it known to the Publick I had Your Grace's Leave to prefix Your Name to this Comedy.</P>
<P><PB REF="7">
I wi&s;h I were capable to cloath the following Scenes in &s;uch a Dre&s;s, as might be worthy to appear before Your Grace, and draw Your Attention as much as Your Grace's admirable Qua|lifications do that of all Mankind; but the Mu&s;es, like mo&s;t Females, are lea&s;t liberal to their own Sex.</P>
<P>All I dare &s;ay in Favour of this Piece is, that the Plot is entirely New, and the Incidents wholly owing to my own In|vention; not borrow'd from our own, or tran&s;lated from the Works of any Foreign Poet; &s;o that they have at lea&s;t the Charm of Novelty to recommend 'em: If they are &s;o lucky in &s;ome lei|&s;ure Hour to give Your Grace the Lea&s;t Diver&s;ion, they will an&s;wer the utmo&s;t Ambition of, my Lord,</P>

<BYLINE>By a GENTLEMAN.</BYLINE>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mrs. THURMOND.</STAGE>
<L>TO-Night we come upon a bold De&s;ign,</L>
<L>To try to plea&s;e without one borrow'd Line:</L>
<L>Our Plot is new, and regularly clear,</L>
<L>And not one &s;ingle Tittle from <HI>Moliere:</HI></L>
<L>O'er bury'd Poets we with Caution tread,</L>
<L>And Pari&s;h Sextons leave to rob the Dead.</L>
<L>For you, bright <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Fair, in hopes to charm ye,</L>
<L>We bring To-night a Lover from the Army:</L>
<L>You know the Soldiers have the &s;trange&s;t Arts,</L>
<L>Such a Proportion of prevailing Parts,</L>
<L>You'd think that they rid Po&s;t to Womens Hearts.</L>
<L>I wonder whence they draw their bold Pretence;</L>
<L>We do not chu&s;e them &s;ure for our Defence:</L>
<L>That Plea is both impolitick and wrong,</L>
<L>And only &s;uits &s;uch Dames as want a Tongue.</L>
<L>Is it their Eloquence and fine Addre&s;s?</L>
<L>The Softne&s;s of their Language?&mdash;Nothing le&s;s.</L>
<L>Is it their Courage, that they bravely dare</L>
<L>To &s;torm the Sex at once?&mdash;Egad, 'tis there:</L>
<L><PB REF="9">They act by us as in the rough Campaign,</L>
<L>Unmindful of Repul&s;es, charge again;</L>
<L>They Mine and Countermine, re&s;olv'd to win,</L>
<L>And, if a Breach is made&mdash;they will come in.</L>
<L>You'll think, by what we have of Soldiers &s;aid,</L>
<L>Our Female Wit was in the Service bred;</L>
<L>But &s;he is to the hardy Toil a Stranger,</L>
<L>She loves the Cloth indeed, but hates the Danger;</L>
<L>Yet to this Circle of the Brave and Gay,</L>
<L>She bid me for her good Intentions &s;ay,</L>
<L>She hopes you'll not reduce her to Half-Pay.</L>
<L>As for our Play, 'tis <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Humour all;</L>
<L>Then will you let our Manufacture fall?</L>
<L>Would you the Honour of our Nation rai&s;e,</L>
<L>Keep <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Credit up, and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plays.</L>

<P>She vi&s;ited a Lady who boarded in the &s;ame Hou&s;e with me: I lik'd her Per&s;on, and found an Op|portunity to tell her &s;o: She reply'd, &s;he had no Obje|ction to mine; but if I could not reconcile Contra|dictions, I mu&s;t not think of her, for that &s;he was con|demned to the Caprice of four Per&s;ons, who never yet agreed in any one thing, and &s;he was oblig'd to plea&s;e them all.</P>

<P>'Tis mo&s;t true, Sir; I'll give you a &s;hort De|&s;cription of the Men, and leave you to judge of the poor Lady's Condition.

<P>The Third is an old Beau, that has <HI>May</HI> in his Fancy and Dre&s;s, but <HI>December</HI> in his Face and his Heels;

he admires nothing but new Fa&s;hions, and tho&s;e mu&s;t be <HI>French;</HI> loves Operas, Balls, Ma&s;querades, and is always the mo&s;t tawdry of the whole Company on a Birth-day.</P>

<P>In my Opinion, that's impo&s;&s;ible.</P>

<P>There is nothing impo&s;&s;ible to a Lover. What would not a Man attempt for a fine Woman and Thirty Thou&s;and Pounds? Be&s;ides, my Honour is at Stake; I promis'd to deliver her&mdash;and &s;he bad me win her, and take her.</P>

<P>If it depended upon Knight-Errantry, I &s;hould not doubt your &s;etting free the Dam&s;el; but to have A|varice, Impertinence, Hypocrifie, and Pride, at once to deal with, requires more Cunning than generally attends a Man of Honour.</P>
