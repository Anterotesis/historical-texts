<HEAD>KING STEPHEN'S WATCH. A TALE, FOUNDED ON FACT. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">King Stephen pre&s;ented a Watch to one of his courtiers, ycleped Sm&mdash;t, and conde&s;cended to regulate it with his own royal hands. Sm&mdash;t being in a promi&s;cuous company, enquiry was made after the hour of the day. Watches were drawn out, when the differences were marked, and con&s;i&s;ted, as u&s;ual, in the variation of &s;ome minutes, from one to ten or fifteen. The royal watch alone was before the foremo&s;t an hour and a half, and was con&s;equently reprobated as heretical. Sm&mdash;t, however, in|&s;i&s;ted that his was right, and <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be right, being regulated by infallible royalty, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE></HEAD>

<L>AVAUNT! ye wi&s;e, di&s;loyal throng,</L>
<L>Who think a monarch may do wrong!</L>
<L>I'll prove, in every rebel's &s;pite,</L>

<L>King Stephen was a worthy peer,</L>
<L>His breeches co&s;t him half a crown,</L>
<L>In which a watch this King did wear,</L>
<L>All in a fob of fu&s;tian brown.</L>

<L>"Heavens!" cries Dean M&mdash;ll&mdash;s in &s;age amaze,</L>
<L>"A watch, and worn in Stephen's days!"</L>

'Tis rude to &s;top a &s;taunch old tory</L>
<L>Thus at the out-&s;et of his &s;tory.</L>
<L>If other folks me tripping catch,</L>
<L>About King Stephen and his watch,</L>
<L>You prudently &s;hould wink, I ween;</L>
<L>You&mdash;a grave Churchman, nay a Dean!</L>
<L>With watch in fob, as fir&s;t I &s;aid,</L>
<L>King Stephen &s;trutted o'er the mead,</L>
<L>And met a courtier &s;lim, yet &s;leek,</L>
<L>With foretop high, and &s;mirking cheek,</L>
<L>Supple his loins, his ham-&s;trings weak;</L>
<L>Who crouch'd, and &s;tretch'd his beak before,</L>
<L>Like goo&s;e approaching a barn-door.</L>
<L>"Hold up thy head," King Stephen cried,</L>
<L>"And walk a while at our left &s;ide.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="6">
Sir courtier! of our courtly train,</L>
<L>We hold thee, the mo&s;t gallant &s;wain;</L>

<L>Whether from nature, or from art,</L>
<L>Yet &s;ure we are thou topp'&s;t thy part.</L>
<L>Here, take this watch, we've &s;et it &s;o,</L>
<L>To tell thee when to come and go,</L>
<L>To fetch and carry as we plea&s;e."</L>
<L>He bow'd, then took it on his knees.</L>
<L>Some &s;ix months after (&s;cene the &s;ame)</L>
<L>With cap in hand our courtier came</L>
<L>To meet King Stephen in his walk,</L>
<L>When, as fit prelude to more talk,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="7">
The King &s;aid, "Courtier, what's o'clock?"</L>
<L>The courtier, in his true blue frock,</L>
<L>Making a mo&s;t ob&s;equious &s;lide,</L>
<L>Produc'd his watch with humble pride,</L>
<L>And, in a &s;oft and &s;ilken tone,</L>
<L>Cried, "Sire, 'tis half an hour pa&s;t one."</L>
<L>"Pa&s;t one! odds body," &s;aid the King,</L>
<L>"Look at the &s;un, 'tis no &s;uch thing,</L>
<L>"He is not near his noon-tide height,</L>
<L>"Be&s;hrew me, 'tis not much pa&s;t eight."</L>
<L>"My Liege," reply'd the dainty creature,</L>
<L>"I re&s;t upon my regulator;</L>

<L>To &s;hine the ruler of my time;</L>
<L>No, gracious Sire, both eve and prime</L>
<L>Your gift &s;hall regulate my motions,</L>
<L>My meals, &s;ecretions, nay devotions.</L>
<L>And may you, Sire! (which Heaven forefend)</L>
<L>With one dread frown my being end,</L>

If e'er my faith &s;o far &s;hould faulter,</L>
