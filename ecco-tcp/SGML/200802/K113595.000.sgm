<HEAD>TO Lord <HI>CLARE.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THANKS, my Lord, for your Ven'&s;on; for finer, or fatter,</L>
<L>Never rang'd in a fore&s;t, or &s;mok'd on a platter:</L>
<L>The Haunch was a picture for Painters to &s;tudy;</L>
<L>The white was &s;o white, and the red was &s;o ruddy!</L>
<L>I had thoughts, in my chamber to hang it in view,</L>
<L>To be &s;hown to my Friends as a piece of <HI>Virt&ugrave;;</HI></L>
<L>As in &s;ome <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Hou&s;es, where things are &s;o-&s;o,</L>
<L>One Gammon of Bacon hangs up for a &s;how;</L>
<L>But, for eating a ra&s;her of what they take pride in,</L>
<L>They'd as &s;oon think of eating the pan it is fry'd in.</L>
<L>But hold&mdash;let us pau&s;e&mdash;Don't I hear you pronounce</L>
<L>This tale of the Bacon a damnable bounce?</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="6">
Well, &s;uppo&s;e it a bounce; &s;ure a Poet may try,</L>
<L>By a bounce now and then, to get courage to fly:</L>
<L>But, my Lord, it's no bounce: I prote&s;t, in my turn,</L>
<L>It's a truth; and your Lord&s;hip may a&s;k Mr. BURNE.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To go on with my tale&mdash;As I gaz'd on the Haunch,</L>
<L>thought of a Friend that was tru&s;ty and &s;taunch:</L>
<L>So I cut it, and &s;ent it to REYNOLDS undre&s;t,</L>
<L>To paint it, or eat it, ju&s;t as he lik'd be&s;t.</L>
<L>Of the Neck and the Brea&s;t I had next to di&s;po&s;e;</L>
<L>'Twas a neck and a brea&s;t&mdash;that might rival MONROE's:</L>
<L>But in parting with the&s;e I was puzzled again,</L>
<L>With the <HI>how,</HI> and the <HI>who,</HI> and the <HI>where,</HI> and the <HI>when:</HI></L>
<L>There's COLEY, and WILLIAMS, and HOWARD, and HIFF&mdash;</L>
<L>I think they love Ven'&s;on; I know they love Beef:</L>
<L>But&mdash;hang it!&mdash;to Poets, that &s;eldom can eat,</L>
<L>Your very good Mutton's a very good treat:</L>
<L>Such dainties to them! It <HI>would</HI> look like a flirt,</L>
<L>Like &s;ending 'em Ruffles when wanting a Shirt.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While thus I debated, in <HI>reverie</HI> center'd,</L>
<L>An Acquaintance, a Friend&mdash;as he call'd him&s;elf, enter'd;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="7">
A fine-&s;poken Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e Officer he,</L>
<L>Who &s;mil'd as he gaz'd on the Ven'&s;on and me.</L>
<L>" What have we got here?&mdash;Aye, this is <HI>good eating!</HI></L>
<L>" Your own, I &s;uppo&s;e&mdash;or is it in waiting?"</L>
<L><HI>Why, who&s;e &s;hould it be, Sir?</HI> cry'd I, with a flounce;</L>
<L><HI>I get the&s;e things often&mdash;</HI>But that was a bounce.</L>
<L>" If that be the ca&s;e then," cry'd he very gay,</L>
<L>" I'm glad I have taken this hou&s;e in my way.</L>
<L>" To-morrow you take a poor dinner with me:</L>
<L>" No words&mdash;I in&s;i&s;t on't&mdash;preci&s;ely at three.</L>
<L>" And now that I think on't, as I am a &s;inner,</L>
<L>" We wanted this Ven'&s;on to make up the dinner.</L>
<L>" I'll take no denial&mdash;you &s;hall, and you mu&s;t;</L>
<L>" And my Wife, little <HI>Kitty,</HI> is famous for Cru&s;t.</L>
<L>" We'll have JOHNSON and BURKE; all the Wits will be there;</L>
<L>" My acquaintance is &s;light, or I'd a&s;k my Lord CLARE.</L>
<L>" Here, Porter! this Ven'&s;on with me to <HI>Mile-end&mdash;</HI></L>
<L>" No words, my dear GOLDSMITH! my very good Friend!"</L>
<L>Thus, &s;eizing his hat, he bru&s;h'd off like the wind,</L>
<L>And the Porter and Eatables follow'd behind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="8">
<L>Left alone to reflect, having empty'd my &s;helf,</L>
<L>And nobody with me at &s;ea, but my&s;elf;</L>
<L>Though I could not help thinking my Gentleman ha&s;ty,</L>
<L>Yet JOHNSON and BURKE, and a good Ven'&s;on Pa&s;ty,</L>
<L>Were things that I never di&s;lik'd in my life,</L>
<L>Though clogg'd with a Coxcomb, and <HI>Kitty</HI> his Wife.</L>
<L>So next day, in due &s;plendor to make my approach,</L>
<L>I drove to his door in my own Hackney-coach.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When come to the place where we all were to dine,</L>
<L>(A chair-lumber'd Clo&s;et, ju&s;t twelve feet by nine)</L>
<L>My Friend bid me welcome, but &s;truck me quite dumb</L>
<L>With tidings <HI>that</HI> JOHNSON and BURKE could not come:</L>
<L>" And I knew it," he cry'd; "both eternally fail;</L>
<L>" The one at the Hou&s;e, and the other with THRALE.</L>
<L>" But, I warrant for me, we &s;hall make up the Party,</L>
<L>" With two full as clever, and ten times as hearty.</L>
<L>" The one is a <HI>Scotchman,</HI> the other a <HI>Jew,</HI></L>
<L>" Who dabble and write in the Papers&mdash;like you:</L>
<L>" The one writes the <HI>Snarler;</HI> the other, the <HI>Scourge:</HI></L>
<L>" Some think he writes <HI>Cinna&mdash;</HI>he owns to <HI>Panurge.</HI>"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="9">
<L>While thus he de&s;crib'd them by Trade and by Name,</L>
<L>They enter'd; and Dinner was &s;erv'd as they came:</L>
<L>At the top a fry'd Liver and Bacon was &s;een;</L>
<L>At the bottom was Tripe in a &s;winging terrene;</L>
<L>At the &s;ides there was Spinage and Pudding made hot;</L>
<L>In the middle&mdash;a place, where the Ven'&s;on was not.</L>
<L>Now, my Lord, as for Tripe, it's my utter aver&s;ion;</L>
<L>And your Bacon I hate, like a <HI>Turk,</HI> or a <HI>Per&s;ian:</HI></L>
<L>But what vex'd me mo&s;t was that damn'd <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Rogue,</L>
<L>With his long-winded &s;peeches, and &s;miles, and his brogue:</L>
<L>" And, Madam," &s;ays he, "may this bit be my poi&s;on</L>
<L>" If a prettier Dinner I ever &s;et eyes on!</L>
<L>" Pray, a &s;lice of your Liver;&mdash;but may I be cur&s;t,</L>
<L>" But I've eat of your Tripe till I'm ready to bur&s;t."</L>
<L>'Your Tripe!' quoth the <HI>Jew,</HI> 'if the truth I may &s;peak,</L>
<L>'I could eat of this Tripe &s;even days in the week:</L>
<L>'I like the&s;e <HI>here</HI> Dinners, &s;o pretty and &s;mall;</L>
<L>'But your Friend there, the Doctor, eats nothing at all.'</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="10">
" O ho!" quoth my Friend, "he'll come on in a trice;</L>
<L>" He's keeping a corner for &s;omething that's nice:</L>
<L>" There's a Pa&s;ty."&mdash;'A Pa&s;ty!' returned the <HI>Scot;</HI></L>
<L>'I don't care if I keep a corner for <HI>thot.</HI>'</L>
<L>" We'll all keep a corner," the Lady cry'd out:</L>
<L><HI>We'll all keep a corner,</HI> was eccho'd about.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While thus we re&s;olv'd, and the Pa&s;ty delay'd,</L>
<L>With looks quite a&s;toni&s;hing enter'd the Maid:</L>
<L>A vi&s;age &s;o &s;ad, and &s;o pale with affright!</L>
<L>Wak'd PRIAM, by drawing his curtains by night.</L>
<L>But too &s;oon we found out (for who could mi&s;take her?)</L>
<L>That &s;he came with &s;ome terrible news from the Baker;</L>
<L>And &s;o it fell out; for that negligent Sloven</L>
<L>Had &s;hut out the Pa&s;ty on &s;hutting his Oven.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sad <HI>Philomel</HI> thus&mdash;but let &s;imiles drop;</L>
<L>And now, that I think on't, the &s;tory may &s;top.</L>
<L>To be plain, my good Lord, 'tis but labour mi&s;plac'd</L>
<L>To &s;end &s;uch good Ver&s;es to one of your ta&s;te:</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="11">
You've got an odd &s;omething, a kind of di&s;cerning,</L>
<L>A reli&s;h, a ta&s;te, &s;icken'd over by learning;</L>
<L>At lea&s;t it's your temper, 'tis very well known,</L>
<L>That you think very &s;lightly of all that's your own:</L>
<L>So perhaps, in your habits of thinking ami&s;s,</L>
<L>You may make a Mi&s;take&mdash;and think &s;lightly of This.</L>
