<P>WHILE the unfortunate Henry was thus vainly &s;truggling again&s;t the ungovernable &s;pirit of his &s;ubjects, his &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or, Edward, was employed in the Holy wars, where he revived the glory of the Engli&s;h name, and made the enemies of Chri&s;tianity tremble. He had arrived at the city of Acon in Pale&s;tine, ju&s;t as the Saracens were &s;itting down to be|&s;iege
<PB N="2" REF="4">
it. He &s;oon relieved the place, follow|ed the enemy, and obtained many victories, which, though &s;plendid, were not deci&s;ive. Such, however, were the enemies' terrors at the progre&s;s of his arms, that they re&s;olved to de&s;troy by treachery that valiant comman|der, whom they could not oppo&s;e in the field. A tribe of Mahometan enthu&s;ia&s;ts had long taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an inacce&s;&s;ible mountain in Syria, under the command of a petty prince, who went, in the Chri&s;tian armies, under the name of the Old Man of the Mountain, and who&s;e &s;ubjects were called A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins; from whence we have &s;ince borrowed the name to &s;ignify a private &s;tabber. The&s;e men, wholly devoted to their commander, and enflamed with a dete&s;table &s;uper&s;tition, undertook to de&s;troy any Chri&s;tian prince or leader, who became obnoxious to their party. It was vain to threaten them with puni&s;hment; they knew the dangers that awaited them, but, re&s;olute to de&s;troy, they ru&s;hed upon certain death. Some time before, the capital of this tribe had been taken by the Tartars, and the inhabitants put to the &s;word; yet there &s;till remained numbers of them, that were educated in that gloomy &s;chool of &s;uper&s;tition; and one of tho&s;e undertook to murder the prince of England. In order to gain admit|tance
<PB N="3" REF="5">
to Edward's pre&s;ence, he pretended to have letters to deliver from the governor of Joppa, propo&s;ing a negociation; and thus he was permitted to &s;ee the prince, who conver&s;ed with him freely in the French language, which the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in under&s;tood. In this manner he continued to amu&s;e him for &s;ome time, be|ing permitted to have free egre&s;s and regre&s;s from the royal apartments. It was on the Friday in Whit&s;un-week, that he found Ed|ward &s;itting in his apartment alone, in a loo&s;e garment, the weather being extremely hot. This was the opportunity the infidel had &s;o long earne&s;tly de&s;ired; and looking round to &s;ee if there were any pre&s;ent to prevent him, and finding him alone, he drew a dagger from his brea&s;t, and attempted to plunge it into the prince's bo&s;om. Edward, had ju&s;t time to perceive the murderer's intention, and, with great pre&s;ence of mind, received the blow upon his arm. Perceiv|ing the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in about to repeat his blow, he &s;truck him at once to the ground with his foot; and wre&s;ting the weapon from his hand, buried it in&s;tantly in his bo&s;om. The dome&s;tics hearing a noi&s;e, quickly came into the room, and &s;oon wreaked their re&s;entment on the perfidious wretch's body, who had thus abu&s;ed the laws of ho&s;pitality. The wound the prince had re|ceived
<PB N="4" REF="6">
was the more dangerous, as having been inflicted with a poi&s;oned dagger; and it &s;oon began to exhibit &s;ome &s;ymptoms that ap|peared fatal. He therefore expected his fate with great intrepidity, and made his will, contented to die in a cau&s;e which he was a&s;|&s;ured would procure him endle&s;s felicity. But his u&s;ual good fortune prevailed; an Engli&s;h &s;urgeon of extraordinary &s;kill, by making deep inci&s;ions, and cutting away the mortified parts, completed the cure, and re&s;tored him to health in little more than a fortnight. A recovery &s;o unexpected, was con&s;idered by the &s;uper&s;ti|tious army as miraculous; nor were there wanting &s;ome, who alledged that he owed his &s;afety to the piety of Eleanora his wife, who &s;ucked the poi&s;on from the wound to &s;ave his life, at the hazard of her own. However this be, it is probable that the per&s;onal danger he incurred by continuing the war in Pale&s;tine, might induce him more readily to li&s;ten to terms of accommodation, which were propo&s;ed &s;oon after by the &s;oldan of Babylon. He re|ceived that monarch's amba&s;&s;adors in a very honourable manner, and concluded a truce with him for ten years, ten weeks, and ten days. Having thus &s;ettled the affairs of Pa|le&s;tine, in the be&s;t manner they would admit
<PB N="5" REF="7">
of, he &s;et &s;ail for Sicily, where he arrived in &s;afety, and there fir&s;t heard the news of the king his father's death, as well as that of his own &s;on John, a boy of &s;ix years of age. He bore the la&s;t with re&s;ignation, but appear|ed extremely afflicted at the death of his fa|ther; at which, when the king of Sicily ex|pre&s;&s;ed his &s;urprize, he ob&s;erved that the death of a &s;on was a lo&s;s which he might hope to repair, but that of a father was a lo&s;s irre|parable.</P>
<P>Though the death of the king happened while the &s;ucce&s;&s;or was &s;o far from home, yet mea&s;ures had been &s;o well taken, that the crown was transferred with the greate&s;t tran|quility. The high character acquired by the prince, during the late commotions, had pro|cured him the e&s;teem and affection of all ranks of men; and, in&s;tead of attempting to oppo&s;e, their whole wi&s;h was to &s;ee him once more return|ing in triumph. But the prince, &s;en&s;ible of the quiet &s;tate of the kingdom, did not &s;eem in much ha&s;te to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne; and he &s;pent near a year in France, before he made his appearance in England. The honours he received from the great upon the continent; and the acclamations, with which he was every where attended by the people, were too al|luring
<PB N="6" REF="8">
to a young mind to be &s;uddenly relin|qui&s;hed: he was even tempted to exhibit proofs of his bravery in a tournament, to which he was invited by the count de Chalons, who defied him to a trial of his &s;kill. Impre&s;&s;ed with high ideas of the chivalry of the times, he accepted the challenge; and propo&s;ed, with his knights, to hold the field again&s;t all that would enter the li&s;ts. His u&s;ual good fortune at|tended him; and his &s;ucce&s;s had like to have converted a trial of &s;kill into a matter of bloody contention. The count de Chalons, being enraged at being foiled, made a &s;erious attack upon the Engli&s;h, in which &s;ome blood was idly &s;pilt; but Edward and his knights &s;till maintained the &s;uperiority. From Chalons Edward proceeded to Paris, where he was magnificently entertained by Philip, king of France, to whom he did homage for the terri|tories the kings of England had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in that kingdom. From Paris he &s;et out for Ga&s;cony, to curb the in&s;olence of Ga&s;ton, count Bearne, who had rebelled in his ab|&s;ence. From thence he pa&s;&s;ed through Mon|treuil, where he accommodated &s;ome differ|ences between the Engli&s;h and Flemings. At length, after various battles, dangers, and fa|tigues, he arrived in his native dominions,
<PB N="7" REF="9">
amid&s;t the loud acclamations of his people, and was &s;olemnly crowned at We&s;tmin&s;ter by the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. The joy of all ranks upon this occa&s;ion was inexpre&s;&s;ible; the fea&s;ting continued a whole fortnight, at the king's expence; five hundred hor&s;es were turned loo&s;e, as the property of tho&s;e who could catch them. The king of Scotland, with &s;everal other princes, graced the &s;olem|nity; and did homage for tho&s;e territories they held under the Engli&s;h crown. Nothing, therefore, remained to complete the felicity of the people but the continuance of &s;uch pro&s;|perity; and this they had every rea&s;on to ex|pect from the king's ju&s;tice, his oeconomy, and his prudence.</P>
<P>As Edward was now come to an undi&s;puted throne, the oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts were proportiona|bly feeble. The barons were exhau&s;ted by long mutual di&s;&s;en&s;ions: the clergy were di|vided in their intere&s;ts, and agreed only in one point, to hate the pope, who had for &s;ome time drained them, with impunity: the people, by &s;ome in&s;urrections again&s;t the convents, appear to have hated the clergy with equal animo&s;ity. The&s;e di&s;agreeing orders only concurred in one point, that of e&s;teeming and reverencing the king. In &s;uch a conjuncture,
<PB N="8" REF="10">
therefore, few mea&s;ures could be taken by the crown that would be deemed oppre&s;&s;ive; and we accordingly find the pre&s;ent monarch often, from his own authority alone, rai&s;ing tho&s;e taxes that would have been peremptorily re|fu&s;ed to his predece&s;&s;or. However, Edward was naturally prudent; and, though capable of becoming ab&s;olute, he &s;atisfied him&s;elf with moderate power, and laboured only to be ter|rible to his enemies.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1274" UNIT="A.D."> His fir&s;t care was to correct tho&s;e di&s;orders which had crept in, under the la&s;t part of his father's feeble admini&s;tration. He propo&s;ed, by an exact di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice, to give equal protection and redre&s;s to all the orders of the &s;tate. He took every opportunity to in&s;pect the conduct of all his magi&s;trates and judges, and to di&s;place &s;uch as were negligent, or cor|rupt. In &s;hort; a &s;y&s;tem of &s;trict ju&s;tice, marked with an air of &s;everity, was pur&s;ued throughout his reign; formidable to the peo|ple, indeed, but yet adapted to the ungovern|able licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the times. The Jews were the only part of his &s;ubjects who were refu&s;ed that equal ju&s;tice which the king made boa&s;t of di&s;|tributing. As Edward had been bred up in prejudices again&s;t them, and as the&s;e were &s;till more confirmed by his expedition to the Holy
<PB N="9" REF="11">
Land, he &s;eemed to have no compa&s;&s;ion upon their &s;ufferings. Many were the arbitrary taxes levied upon them; two hundred and eigh|ty of them were hanged at once, upon a charge of adulterating the coin of the kingdom; the goods of the re&s;t were confi&s;cated, and all of that religion utterly bani&s;hed the kingdom. This &s;everity was very grateful to the people, who hated the Jews, not only for their tenets, but for their method of living, which was by u&s;ury and extortion.</P>
<P>But Edward had too noble a &s;pirit to be con|tent with the applau&s;e this petty oppre&s;&s;ion acquired; he re&s;olved to march again&s;t Le|wellyn, prince of North Wales, who had refu|&s;ed to do homage for his dominions, and &s;eem|ed bent upon renouncing all dependence upon the crown of England. The Wel&s;h had for many ages enjoyed their own laws, language, cu&s;toms, and opinions. They were the re|mains of the ancient Britons, who had e&s;caped the Roman and Saxon inva&s;ions, and &s;till pre|&s;erved their freedom and their country, uncon|taminated by the admi&s;&s;ion of foreign conque|rors. But as they were, from their number, incapable of with&s;tanding their more powerful neighbours on the plain, their chief defence lay in their inacce&s;&s;ible mountains, tho&s;e natural
<PB N="10" REF="12">
bulwarks of the country.<MILESTONE N="1276" UNIT="A.D."> Whenever England was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by factions at home, or its forces called off to wars abroad, the Wel&s;h made it a con&s;tant practice to pour in their irregular troops, and lay the open country wa&s;te where|ever they came. Nothing could be more perni|cious to a country than &s;everal neighbouring independent principalities, under different commanders, and pur&s;uing different intere&s;ts; the mutual jealou&s;ies of &s;uch were &s;ure to har|ra&s;s the people; and wherever victory was pur|cha&s;ed, it was always at the expence of the gene|ral welfare. Sen&s;ible of this, Edward had long wi&s;hed to reduce that incur&s;ive people, and had ordered Lewellyn to do homage for his territories; which &s;ummons the Wel&s;h prince refu&s;ed to obey, unle&s;s the king's own &s;on &s;hould be delivered as an ho&s;tage for his &s;afe return. The king was not di&s;plea&s;ed at this refu&s;al, as it &s;erved to give him a pretext for his intended inva&s;ion. He therefore levied an army again&s;t Lewellyn, and marched into his country with certain a&s;&s;urance of &s;ucce&s;s. Upon the ap|proach of Edward, the Wel&s;h prince took refuge among the inacce&s;&s;ible mountains of Snowdon, and there re&s;olved to maintain his ground, without tru&s;ting to the chance of a battle. The&s;e were the &s;teep retreats, that had for
<PB N="11" REF="13">
many ages before defended his ance&s;tors again&s;t all the attempts of the Norman and Saxon con|querors. But Edward, equally vigorous and cautious, having explored every part of his way, pierced into the very center of Lewellyn's territories, and approached the Wel&s;h army in its la&s;t retreats. Lewellyn at fir&s;t little regard|ed the progre&s;s of an enemy, that he &s;uppo&s;ed would make a tran&s;ient inva&s;ion, and then de|part; but his contempt was turned into con&s;ter|nation, when he &s;aw Edward place his forces at the foot of the mountains, and hem up his ar|my, in order to force it by famine. De&s;titute of magazines, and cooped upon in a narrow corner of the country, without provi&s;ions for his troops, or pa&s;turage for his cattle, nothing remained but death, or &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion; &s;o that the unfortunate Wel&s;h prince, without being able to &s;trike a blow for his in|dependence, was at la&s;t, obliged to &s;ubmit at di&s;cretion, and to receive &s;uch terms as the victor was plea&s;ed to impo&s;e. Lewellyn con|&s;ented to pay fifty thou&s;and pounds, as a &s;atis|faction for damages; to do homage to the crown of England; to permit all other barons, except four near Snowdon, to &s;wear fealty in the &s;ame manner; to relinqui&s;h the country between Che&s;hire and the river Conway; to do
<PB N="12" REF="14">
ju&s;tice to his own family, and to deliver ho&s;ta|ges for the &s;ecurity of his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1271" UNIT="A.D."> But this treaty was only of &s;hort duration: the oppre&s;&s;ion of the conqueror, and the in|dignant pride of the conquered nation, could not long remain without producing new di&s;|&s;en&s;ions. The lords of the Marches commit|ted all kinds of inju&s;tice on their Wel&s;h neighbours; and although Edward remitted the fifty thou&s;and pounds penalty, yet he laid other re&s;trictions &s;ome time after upon Lewellyn, which that prince con&s;idered as more injurious. He particularly exacted a promi&s;e from him at Wor|ce&s;ter, that he would retain no per&s;on in his prin|cipality, that &s;hould be di&s;agreeable to the Eng|li&s;h monarch. The&s;e were in&s;ults too great to be endured, and once more the Wel&s;h flew to arms. A body of their forces took the field, under the command of David, the brother of their prince, ravaged the plain country, took the ca&s;tle of Harwardin, made Sir Roger Clifford, ju&s;tice of the Marches, who was very dangerou&s;ly wounded, their pri|&s;oner, and &s;oon after laid &s;iege to the ca&s;tle of Ruthland. When the account of the&s;e ho&s;tilities was brought to Edward, he a&s;&s;embled a nu|merous army, and &s;et out with a fierce re&s;olu|tion to exterminate Lewellyn and his whole fa|mily;
<PB N="13" REF="15">
and to reduce that people to &s;uch an ab|ject &s;tate, that they &s;hould never after be able to revolt, or di&s;tre&s;s their more peaceable neighbours. At fir&s;t, however, the king's endeavours were not attended with their u&s;ual &s;ucce&s;s; having cau&s;ed a bridge of boats to be laid over the river Menay, a body of forces, commanded by lord Latimer, and de Thonis, pa&s;&s;ed over before it was completely fini&s;hed, to &s;ignalize their courage again&s;t the enemy. The Wel&s;h patiently remained in their fortre&s;&s;es till they &s;aw the tide flowing in beyond the end of the bridge, and thus cutting off the retreat of the a&s;&s;ailants. It was then that they poured down from their mountains with hideous out|cries; and, with the mo&s;t ungovernable fury, put the whole body that had got over to the &s;word. This defeat revived the &s;inking &s;pirits of the Wel&s;h; and it was now univer&s;ally be|lieved by that poor &s;uper&s;titious people, that heaven had declared in their favour. A &s;tory ran, that it was foretold, in the prophecies of Merlin, that Lewellyn was to be the re&s;torer of Brutus's empire in Britain: a wizzard had progno&s;ticated, that he &s;hould ride through the &s;treets of London with a crown upon his head. The&s;e were inducements &s;ufficiently &s;trong to per&s;uade this prince to hazard a deci&s;ive
<PB N="14" REF="16">
battle again&s;t the Engli&s;h. With this view, he marched into Radnor&s;hire; and pa&s;&s;ing the river Wey, his troops were &s;urpri&s;ed and defeated by Edward Mortimer, while he him&s;elf was ab&s;ent from his army, upon a conference with &s;ome of the barons of that country. Upon his return, &s;ee|ing the dreadful &s;ituation of his affairs, he ran de&s;perately into the mid&s;t of the enemy, and quickly found that death he &s;o ardently &s;ought for. One of the Engli&s;h captains recognizing his countenance, &s;evered his head from his bo|dy, and it was &s;ent to London, where it was re|ceived with extreme demon&s;trations of joy. The brutal &s;pirit of the times will &s;ufficiently appear from the barbarity of the citizens on this occa&s;ion: the head being encircled in a &s;il|ver coronet, to fulfil the prediction of the wizzard, it was placed by them upon a pillory, that the populace might glut their eyes with &s;uch an agreeable &s;pectacle. David, the bro|ther of this unfortunate prince, &s;oon after &s;hared the &s;ame fate; while his followers, quite di&s;pirited by the lo&s;s of their beloved leader, obeyed but &s;lowly, and fought with reluctance. Thus being at la&s;t totally aban|doned, he was obliged to hide him&s;elf in one of the ob&s;cure caverns of the country; but his retreat being &s;oon after di&s;covered,
<PB N="15" REF="17">
he was taken, tried, and condemned, as a traitor. His &s;entence was executed with the mo&s;t vigorous &s;everity; he was hanged, drawn and quartered, only for having bravely defend|ed the expiring liberties of his native country, and his own hereditary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. With him expired the government, and the di&s;tinction of his nation. It was &s;oon after united to the kingdom of England, made a principality, and given to the elde&s;t &s;on of the crown. Fo|reign conque&s;ts might add to the glory, but this added to the felicity of the kingdom. The Wel&s;h were now blended with the con|querors; and in the revolution of a few ages, all national animo&s;ity was entirely forgotten.</P>
<P>At the time of the conque&s;t, however, the Wel&s;h &s;ubmitted with extreme reluctance; and few nations ever bowed to a foreign yoke with greater indignation. The bards of the coun|try, who&s;e employment con&s;i&s;ted in rehear&s;ing the glorious deeds of their ance&s;tors, were particularly obnoxious to the king, who, con|&s;idering that while they continued to keep the ancient flame alive, he mu&s;t expect no peace in his new acqui&s;itions, ordered them to be ma&s;&s;acred, from motives of barbarous policy, at that time not uncommon. This &s;everity he is &s;aid to have &s;oftened by another mea&s;ure,
<PB N="16" REF="18">
equally politic, and far le&s;s culpable. In or|der to flatter their vanity, and amu&s;e their &s;u|per&s;tition, he left his queen to be delivered in the ca&s;tle of Caernarvon; and afterwards pre|&s;ented the child, who&s;e name was Edward, to the Wel&s;h lords, as a native of their coun|try, and as their appointed prince. The lords received him with acclamations of joy, con&s;idering him as a ma&s;ter, who would go|vern them as a di&s;tinct people from the Eng|li&s;h, there being at that time another heir ap|parent to the Engli&s;h crown. But the death of the elde&s;t &s;on, Alphon&s;o, &s;oon after made young Edward, who had been thus created prince of Wales, heir al&s;o to the Engli&s;h mo|narchy; and ever &s;ince the government of both nations has continued to flow in one un|divided channel.</P>
<P>This great and important conque&s;t being atchieved, paved the way for one of &s;till more importance, though not attended with &s;uch permanent con&s;equences. Alexander III. king of Scotland, had been killed by a fall from his hor&s;e, leaving only Margaret, his grand-daughter, heir to the crown, who died &s;ome time after. The death of this prince&s;s pro|duced a mo&s;t ardent di&s;pute about the &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion to the Scotti&s;h throne, being claimed by
<PB N="17" REF="19">
no le&s;s than twelve competitors. That nation being thus divided into as many factions as there were pretenders, the guardians of the realm would not undertake to decide a di&s;pute of &s;o much con&s;equence. The nobility of the country were no le&s;s divided in their opini|ons; and, after long debates, they at la&s;t unani|mou&s;ly agreed to refer the conte&s;t to the deter|mination of the king of England. The claims of all the other candidates were reduced to three; who were the de&s;cendants of the earl of Huntington by three daughters; John Ha&s;tings, who claimed in right of his mother, as one of the co-heire&s;&s;es of the crown; John Baliol, who alledged his right, as being de&s;cended from the elde&s;t daughter, who was his grandmother; and Robert Bruce, who was the actual &s;on of the &s;econd daughter. In this conte&s;t, which was referred to Edward, he pretended the ut|mo&s;t degree of deliberation; and although he had long formed his re&s;olution, yet he ordered all enquiries to be made on the &s;ubject, that he might be ma&s;ter of the arguments that could be advanced on any &s;ide of the que&s;tion. In this re&s;earch, he &s;oon di&s;covered that &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in old chronicles might be produced to favour his own &s;ecret inclinations; and without further delay, in&s;tead of admitting the
<PB N="18" REF="20">
claims of the competitors, he boldly urged his own; and, to &s;econd his preten&s;ions, ad|vanced with a formidable army to the frontiers of the kingdom.</P>
<P>The Scotti&s;h barons were thunder-&s;truck at the&s;e unexpected preten&s;ions; and though they felt the mo&s;t extreme indignation at his proce|dure, yet they re&s;olved to obey his &s;ummons to meet at the ca&s;tle of Norham; a place &s;ituated on the &s;outhern banks of the Tweed, where he convened the parliament of that country. He there produced the proofs of his &s;uperiority, which he alledged were unque&s;tionable, and de&s;ired their concurrence with his claims; at the &s;ame time advi&s;ing them to u&s;e delibera|tion, and to examine all his allegations with impartial ju&s;tice. To a propo&s;al that appeared in it&s;elf &s;o unrea&s;onable, no immediate an&s;wer could be given; for where all is defective, it is not ea&s;y to &s;ubmit to the combating a part: the barons, therefore, continued &s;ilent; and Edward interpreting this for a con&s;ent, ad|dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the &s;everal competitors to the crown; and, previous to his appointing one of them as his va&s;&s;al, he required their acknowlegement of his &s;uperiority. He na|turally concluded that none of them would venture to di&s;oblige the man who was unani|mou&s;ly
<PB N="19" REF="21">
appointed to be the arbitrator of his pre|ten&s;ions. Nor was he deceived; he found them all equally ob&s;equious on this occa&s;ion. Ro|bert Bruce was the fir&s;t who made the acknow|legement, and the re&s;t quickly followed his example. Edward being thus become the &s;u|perior of the kingdom, undertook next to con&s;ider which of the candidates was the fitte&s;t to be appointed under him; or it may be, as they appeared all indifferent to him, which had the ju&s;te&s;t claim. In order to give this deli|beration the appearance of impartiality, an hundred commi&s;&s;ioners were appointed, forty of them being cho&s;en by the candidates who were in the intere&s;ts of John Baliol; forty by tho&s;e in the intere&s;ts of Robert Bruce; and twenty, who were cho&s;en by Edward him&s;elf. Having thus fitted matters to his &s;atisfaction, he left the commi&s;&s;ioners to &s;it at Berwick; and went &s;outhward, to free their deliberations from all &s;hadow of re&s;traint. The &s;ubject of the di&s;pute ultimately re&s;ted in this que&s;tion, Whether Baliol, who was de&s;cended from the elder &s;i&s;ter, but farther removed by one de|gree, was to be preferred before Bruce, who was actually the younger &s;i&s;ter's &s;on? The rights of inheritance, as at pre&s;ent generally prac|ti&s;ed over Europe, were even at that time pretty
<PB N="20" REF="22">
well a&s;certained; and not only the commi&s;|&s;ioners, but many of the be&s;t lawyers of the age, univer&s;ally concurred in affirming Baliol's &s;uperior claim. Edward, therefore, pro|nounced &s;entence in his favour; and that can|didate, upon renewing his oath of fealty to England, was put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Scotti&s;h kingdom, and all its fortre&s;&s;es, which had been previou&s;ly put into the hands of the king of England.</P>
<P>Baliol being thus placed upon the Scotti&s;h throne, le&s;s as a king than as a va&s;&s;al, Ed|ward's fir&s;t &s;tep was &s;ufficient to convince that people of his intentions to &s;tretch the preroga|tive to the utmo&s;t. In&s;tead of gradually accu&s;|toming the Scots to bear the Engli&s;h yoke, and of &s;liding in his new power upon them by &s;low and imperceptible degrees, he began at once to give them notice of his intentions. A mer|chant of Ga&s;cony had pre&s;ented a petition to him, importing, that Alexander, the late king of Scotland, was indebted to him a large &s;um, which was &s;till unpaid, notwith&s;tanding all his &s;ollicitations to Baliol, the pre&s;ent king, for pay|ment; Edward eagerly embraced this opportu|nity of exerci&s;ing his new right, and &s;ummoned the king of Scotland to appear at We&s;tmin&s;ter, to an&s;wer in per&s;on the merchant's complaint.
<PB N="21" REF="23">
Upon &s;ubjects equally trivial, he &s;ent &s;ix dif|ferent &s;ummon&s;es, at different times, in one year; &s;o that the poor Scotti&s;h king &s;oon per|ceived that he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the name only, but not the authority of a &s;overeign. Willing, therefore, to &s;hake off the yoke of &s;o trouble|&s;ome a ma&s;ter, Baliol revolted, and procured the pope's ab&s;olution from his former oaths of homage. To &s;trengthen his hands &s;till more, he entered into a &s;ecret treaty with Philip, king of France; which was the commencement of an union between the&s;e two nations, that for &s;o many &s;ucceeding ages were fatal to the inte|re&s;ts of England. To confirm this alliance, the king of Scotland &s;tipulated a marriage be|tween his elde&s;t &s;on, and the daughter of Phi|lip de Valois.</P>
<P>Edward, to whom the&s;e tran&s;actions were no &s;ecret, endeavoured to ward the threatened blow, by being the fir&s;t aggre&s;&s;or; and accor|dingly &s;ummoned John to perform the duty of a va&s;&s;al, and to &s;end him a &s;upply of forces a|gain&s;t an inva&s;ion from France, with which &s;tate he had for &s;ome time been at variance. He al&s;o &s;ummoned him to &s;urrender &s;ome of his principal forts, and to appear at a parlia|ment which was held at Newca&s;tle. None of the&s;e commands, as he well fore&s;aw, being
<PB N="22" REF="24">
complied with, he re&s;olved to enforce obedi|ence by marching a body of thirty thou&s;and foot, and four thou&s;and hor&s;e, into the heart of the kingdom of Scotland. As the Scotti&s;h nation had little reliance on the vigour, or the courage of their king, they had a&s;&s;igned him a council of twelve noblemen to a&s;&s;i&s;t; or more properly &s;peaking, to &s;uperintend his proceed|ings. They rai&s;ed an army of forty thou|&s;and men for the pre&s;ent emergency, and marched them away to the frontiers, which Edward was now preparing to attack. But &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the Scotti&s;h nobility, among whom were Robert Bruce and his &s;on, endeavoured to ingratiate them&s;elves with Edward by an early &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, which &s;erved not a little to intimidate tho&s;e who &s;till adhered to their king. The progre&s;s, there|fore, of the Engli&s;h arms was extremely rapid; Berwick was taken by a&s;&s;ault; Sir William Douglas, the governor, made pri&s;oner, and a garri&s;on of &s;even thou&s;and men put to the &s;word. Elated by the&s;e advantages, Edward di&s;patched the earl Warenne, with ten thou|&s;and men, to lay &s;iege to Dunbar; and the Scotch, &s;en&s;ible of the importance of that place, advanced with their whole army, under the command of the earls Mar, Buchan, and
<PB N="23" REF="25">
Lenox, to relieve it. Although the &s;uperiori|ty of numbers was greatly on their &s;ide, yet courage and di&s;cipline was entirely on that of the Engli&s;h. The conflict was of &s;hort conti|nuance; the Scots were &s;oon thrown into confu|&s;ion, and twenty thou&s;and of their men were &s;lain upon the field of battle. The ca&s;tle of Dunbar, with all its garri&s;on, &s;urrendered the day following; and Edward, who was now come up with the main body of his army, led them onward into the country to certain con|que&s;t. The ca&s;tles of the greate&s;t &s;trength and importance opened their gates to him almo&s;t without re&s;i&s;tance; and the whole &s;outhern part of the country acknowleged the con|queror. The northern parts were not &s;o ea&s;ily reducible, being defended by the inacce&s;&s;ible mountains, and intricate fore&s;ts, that deform the face of that country. To make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of this part of the kingdom, Edward re|inforced his army with numbers of men levied in Ireland and Wales, who, being u&s;ed to this kind of de&s;ultory war, were be&s;t qualified to &s;eek, or pur&s;ue the latent enemy. But Baliol made the&s;e preparations unnece&s;&s;ary; he found that a ready &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion was more &s;afe and ea&s;y than a fierce re&s;i&s;tance drawn out among mountainous de&s;erts, and tho&s;e &s;olitudes, made
<PB N="24" REF="26">
&s;till more dreadful by famine. He ha&s;tened, therefore, to make his peace with the victor, and expre&s;&s;ed the deepe&s;t repentance for his former di&s;loyalty. To &s;atisfy him &s;till further, he made a &s;olemn re&s;ignation of the crown into his hands; and the whole kingdom &s;oon after followed his example. Edward thus ma&s;ter of the kingdom, took every precaution to &s;ecure his title, and to aboli&s;h tho&s;e di&s;tinctions, which might be apt to keep the nation in its former independence. He carefully de&s;troyed all re|cords and monuments of antiquity, that in|&s;pired the people with a &s;pirit of national pride. He carried away a &s;tone, which the traditions of the vulgar pretended to have been Jacob's pillow, on which all their kings were &s;eated, when they were anointed. This, the ancient tradition had a&s;&s;ured them, was the mark of their government; and wherever it was placed, their command was always to follow. The great &s;eal of Baliol was broke; and that un|happy monarch him&s;elf was carried as a pri&s;oner to London, and committed to cu&s;tody in the Tower. Two years afterwards he was re&s;tored to his liberty, and bani&s;hed to France, where he died in a private &s;tation, without making any further attempts to rein&s;tate him&s;elf upon the throne; happier perhaps in privacy, than if gratified in the pur&s;uits of ambition.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="27">The ce&s;&s;ation which was given to Edward by tho&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es, in his in&s;ular dominions, induced him to turn his ambition to the con|tinent, where he expected to recover a part of tho&s;e territories that had been u&s;urped from his crown, during the imbecillity of his prede|ce&s;&s;ors. There had been a rupture with France &s;ome time before, upon a very trifling occa&s;ion. A Norman and Engli&s;h &s;hip met off the coa&s;t, near Bayonne; and having both oc|ca&s;ion to draw water from the &s;ame &s;pring, there happened a quarrel for the preference. This &s;cuffle, in which a Norman was &s;lain, produced a complaint to the king of France, who de&s;i|red the complainant to take his own revenge, and not bring &s;uch matters before him. This the Normans did &s;hortly after; for &s;eizing the crew of a &s;hip in the channel, they hanged a part of them, together with &s;ome dogs, in the pre&s;ence of all their companions. This produ|ced a retaliation from the Engli&s;h cinque-ports; and the animo&s;ity of the merchants on both &s;ides being wrought up to fury, the &s;ea became a &s;cene of piracy and murder. No quarter was given on either &s;ide; the mariners were de&s;|troyed by thou&s;ands; and at la&s;t the affair be|came too &s;erious for the &s;overeigns of either &s;ide to continue any longer unconcerned &s;pec|tators.
<PB N="26" REF="28">
Some ineffectual overtures were made for an accommodation; but Edward &s;eeing that it was likely to come to an open rupture, gave orders for having his territory of Guien|ne, upon the continent, put into a po&s;ture of defence. Nor was he remi&s;s in making trea|ties with &s;everal neighbouring princes, who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance he purcha&s;ed, though greatly to the diminution of his &s;canty revenues. He even &s;ent an army, collected in England from the jails, which had been filled with robbers in the former reign, and who were now made &s;ervice|able to the &s;tate. The&s;e, tho' at fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful, under the command of John de Bretagne, earl of Richmond, were, however, &s;oon repul&s;ed by the French army, under the command of Charles, brother to the king of France. Yet it was not ea&s;y to di&s;courage Edward from any favourite pur&s;uit.<MILESTONE N="1296" UNIT="A.D."> In about three years after, he again renewed his attempts upon Guienne, and &s;ent thither an army of &s;even thou&s;and men, under the command of his brother, the earl of Lanca&s;ter. That prince gained, at fir&s;t &s;ome advantages over the French at Bour|deaux; but he was &s;oon after &s;eized with a di&s;|temper, of which he died at Bayonne.</P>
<P>The king finding his attempts upon that quarter un&s;ucce&s;sful, re&s;olved to attack France

upon another, where he hoped that kingdom would be more vulnerable. He formed an alliance with John, earl of Holland, by giv|ing him his daughter Elizabeth in marriage; and al&s;o with Guy, earl of Flanders, who&s;e a&s;|&s;i&s;tance he procured, for the &s;tipulated &s;um of &s;eventy-five thou&s;and pounds. From the&s;e a&s;|&s;i&s;tances he entertained hopes of being once more able to recover his hereditary dominions; and he accordingly &s;et him&s;elf earne&s;tly about providing money for &s;uch an arduous under|taking. This was not obtained without the greate&s;t &s;truggles with his clergy and the people; &s;o that when he came to take the field in Flanders, at the head of an army of fifty-thou&s;and men, the proper &s;ea&s;on of ac|tion was lo&s;t; wherefore the king of France, and he were glad to come to an accommo|dation, by which they agreed to &s;ubmit their differences to the arbitration of the pope. By his mediation it was agreed between them, that their union &s;hould be cemented with a double marriage; that of Edward with Margaret, Philip's &s;i&s;ter; and that of the prince of Wales with I&s;abella, the French monarch's daughter. Philip was prevailed on to re&s;tore Guienne to the Engli&s;h. He agreed al&s;o, to abandon the king of Scotland, upon condition that Edward
<PB N="28" REF="30">
&s;hould in like manner neglect the earl of Flan|ders. Thus, after a very expen&s;ive war, the two monarchs were obliged to &s;it down ju&s;t where they began; and, in&s;tead of making preparations again&s;t each other, they re&s;olved to turn the weight of their power upon their weaker neighbours.</P>
<P>But though this expedition was thus fruit|le&s;sly terminated, yet the expences which were requi&s;ite for fitting it out, were not only bur|then&s;ome to the king, but even, in the event, threatened to &s;hake him on his throne. In or|der at fir&s;t to &s;et the great machine in move|ment, he rai&s;ed con&s;iderable &s;upplies by means of his parliament; and that augu&s;t body was then fir&s;t modelled by him into the form in which it continues to this day. As a great part of the property of the kingdom was now, by the introduction of commerce, and the improve|ment of agriculture, transferred from the ba|rons to the lower cla&s;&s;es of the people, &s;o their con&s;ent was thought nece&s;&s;ary for the rai&s;ing any con&s;iderable &s;upplies. For this rea&s;on, he i&s;&s;ued writs to the &s;heriffs, enjoining them to &s;end to parliament along with two knights of the &s;hire, (as in the former reign) two depu|ties from each borough within their county; and the&s;e provided with &s;ufficient powers from
<PB N="29" REF="31">
their con&s;tituents, to grant &s;uch demands as they &s;hould think rea&s;onable for the &s;afety of the &s;tate. The charges of the&s;e deputies were to be borne by the borough which &s;ent them; and &s;o far were they from con&s;idering their deputation as an honour, nothing could be more di&s;plea&s;ing to any borough than to be thus obliged to &s;end a deputy, or to any indi|vidual than to be thus cho&s;en. However, the authority of the&s;e commoners encrea&s;ed by time. Their union gave them weight; and it became cu&s;tomary among them, in return for the &s;upplies which they had granted, to prefer petitions to the crown for the redre&s;s of tho&s;e grievances, under which they &s;uppo&s;ed the na|tion to labour. The more the king's nece&s;&s;ities increa&s;ed, the more he found it expedient to give them an early redre&s;s, till from reque&s;ting, the commons proceeded to requiring; and, having all the property of the nation, they by degrees began to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the power. Such was the con&s;titution of that parliament, to which Edward applied for a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t France. He obtained from the barons and knights, a grant of the twelfth of their move|ables, from the boroughs an eighth; and from the clergy he re&s;olved to exact a fifth: but he there found an unexpected re&s;i&s;t|ance.
<PB N="30" REF="32">
This body of men, who had already felt the weight of his nece&s;&s;ities, re&s;olved to a|vail them&s;elves of any pretext rather than thus &s;ubmit to &s;uch an heavy and di&s;proportioned impo&s;ition. The pope had &s;ome time before i&s;&s;ued a bull, prohibiting the clergy from pay|ing taxes to any temporal prince, without per|mi&s;&s;ion from the &s;ee of Rome; and tho&s;e of England now pleaded con&s;cience, in refu&s;ing to comply with the king's demand. They al|ledged, that they owed obedience to two &s;overeigns, a &s;piritual and a temporal; but that their eternal happine&s;s bound them to obey one, while only their worldly &s;afety led them to acknowledge the commands of the other. Edward was &s;omewhat mortified at their refu&s;al, but employed their own argu|ments with great force again&s;t them. He re|fu&s;ed them his temporal protection, ordered his judges to receive no cau&s;e brought before them by the clergy, but to hear and decide all cau&s;es, in which they were defendants; to do every man ju&s;tice again&s;t them; and to deny them ju&s;tice even under the greate&s;t injury.</P>
<P>In this outlawed &s;ituation, they &s;uffered numberle&s;s hard&s;hips from every ruffian, while the king's officers remained unconcerned &s;pec|tators of the ravages committed upon them, without incurring the hatred of oppre&s;&s;ive
<PB N="31" REF="33">
or vindictive cruelty. Whenever the clergy ventured from home, they were di&s;mounted from their hor&s;es, and robbed of their cloaths; the primate him&s;elf was attacked on the high|way, and &s;tripped of all his equipage and fur|niture. The&s;e &s;everities, at length, prevailed; and the clergy agreed to lay the &s;ums they were taxed in &s;ome church appointed them, which were to be taken away by the king's officers. Thus at once they obeyed the king, without incurring the cen&s;ures of the pope. But though the&s;e &s;ums were very great, yet they were by no means adequate to the wants of the &s;tate. New taxes were, therefore, arbitrarily impo&s;ed. Edward laid a duty of forty &s;hillings a &s;ack upon wool; he required the &s;heriffs of each county to &s;upply him with two thou&s;and quarters of wheat, and as many of oats, with|out con&s;idering the manner they were to be obtained. The&s;e he levied by way of loans, promi&s;ing to pay an equivalent, whenever the exigencies of the &s;tate were le&s;s pre&s;&s;ing. Such various modes of oppre&s;&s;ion were not &s;uffered without murmuring. The clergy were already di&s;gu&s;ted to a man; the people complained at tho&s;e extortions they could not re&s;i&s;t; while many of the more powerful barons, jealous of their own privileges, as well as of national
<PB N="32" REF="34">
liberty, gave countenance to the general di&s;|content.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;ymptoms of this &s;pirit of re&s;i&s;t|ance appeared, upon the king's ordering Hum|phry Bohun, the con&s;table; and Roger Bigod, the mare&s;chal of England, to take the com|mand of an army that he propo&s;ed to &s;end over into Ga&s;cony, while he him&s;elf intended to make a diver&s;ion on the &s;ide of Flanders. But the&s;e two powerful noblemen refu&s;ed to obey his orders, alledging, that they were obliged by their offices to attend him only in the wars, and not to conduct his armies. A violent altercation en&s;ued. The king, addre&s;|&s;ing him&s;elf to the con&s;table, cried out, <Q REND="inline">"Sir earl, by God, you &s;hall either go or be hanged."</Q> To which the haughty baron replied, <Q REND="inline">"Sir king, by God, I will neither go, nor be hang|ed."</Q> This oppo&s;ition quite defeated his &s;cheme for the conque&s;t of Guienne. He found he had driven prerogative a little too far; and with that pre&s;ence of mind which always brought him back, when he had the lea&s;t gone beyond the line of di&s;cretion, he de&s;ired to be reconciled to his barons, to the church, and to his people. He therefore pleaded the ur|gent nece&s;&s;ities of the crown; and promi&s;ed, upon his return from Flanders, whither he was
<PB N="33" REF="35">
then going, to redre&s;s all grievances, to re&s;tore the execution of the laws, and to make his &s;ub|jects compen&s;ation for the lo&s;&s;es which they had &s;u&s;tained. The&s;e profe&s;&s;ions &s;erved pretty well to allay the kindling di&s;contents of the nation, during his ab&s;ence abroad, except that the en|&s;uing parliament only the two noblemen, at|tended by a great body of cavalry and infantry, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city gates, and obliged the king's council to &s;ign the Magna Charta, and to add a clau&s;e, to &s;ecure the nation for ever again&s;t all impo&s;itions and taxes, without the con|&s;ent of parliament. This the council readily a|greed to &s;ign; and the king him&s;elf, when it was &s;ent over to him in Flanders, after &s;ome he&s;itation, thought proper to do the &s;ame. The&s;e conce&s;|&s;ions he again confirmed upon his return; and though it is probable he was aver&s;e to granting them, yet he was at la&s;t brought to give a ple|nary con&s;ent to all the articles that were de|manded of him. Thus, after the conte&s;t of an age, the Magna Charta was finally e&s;tab|li&s;hed; nor was it the lea&s;t circum&s;tance in its favour, that its confirmation was procured from one of the greate&s;t and bolde&s;t princes that ever &s;wayed the Engli&s;h &s;ceptre.</P>
<P>But though the confirmation of this charter was obtained without much violence, yet it is
<PB N="34" REF="36">
probable, that the di&s;turbance given by Scot|land about the &s;ame time, might have ha&s;t|ened its final execution.<MILESTONE N="1297" UNIT="A.D."> That fierce nation, which had been conquered &s;ome time before with &s;o much ea&s;e, &s;till di&s;covered a &s;pirit of independence, that no &s;everity could re&s;train, nor defeats &s;ubdue. The earl Warrenne had been left ju&s;ticiary in that kingdom; and his prudence and moderation were equal to his va|lour. He therefore protected the people with his ju&s;tice, as he had &s;ubdued them by his arms: but being obliged, by the bad &s;tate of his health, to leave that kingdom, he left the admini&s;tration in the hands of two very im|proper mini&s;ters; the one, who&s;e name was Orme&s;by, was rigorous and cruel; the other, called Cre&s;&s;ingham, was avaricious and mean. Under &s;uch an admini&s;tration little &s;tability could be expected; and their inju&s;tice &s;oon drove this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed people into open rebellion. A few of tho&s;e who had fled into the mo&s;t in|acce&s;&s;ible mountains from the arms of Ed|ward, took this opportunity to pour down, and &s;trike for freedom. They were headed by William Wallace, &s;o celebrated in Scotti&s;h &s;tory, the younger &s;on of a gentleman, who lived in the we&s;tern part of the kingdom. He was a man of a gigantic &s;tature, in|credible
<PB N="35" REF="37">
&s;trength, and amazing intrepidity; eagerly de&s;irous of independence, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed with the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted &s;pirit of patriot|i&s;m. To this man had re&s;orted all tho&s;e who were obnoxious to the Engli&s;h government; the proud, the bold, the criminal, and the ambitious. The&s;e, bred among dangers and hard&s;hips them&s;elves, could not forbear admir|ing in their leader a degree of patience, un|der fatigue and famine, which they &s;uppo&s;ed beyond the power of human nature to endure; he &s;oon, therefore, became the principal ob|ject of their affection and their e&s;teem. His fir&s;t exploits were confined to petty ravages, and occa&s;ional attacks upon the Engli&s;h. As his forces encrea&s;ed, his efforts became more formidable; every day brought accounts of his great actions; his party was joined fir&s;t by the de&s;perate, and then by the enterprizing; at la&s;t, all who loved their country came to take &s;helter under his protection. Thus reinforced, he formed a plan of &s;urprizing Or|me&s;by, the unworthy Engli&s;h mini&s;ter, who re&s;ided at Scone; but though this tyrant e&s;caped the meditated irruption, yet his effects &s;erved to recompen&s;e the in&s;urgents. From this time, the Scots began to grow too powerful for the
<PB N="36" REF="38">
Engli&s;h that were appointed to govern them; many of their principal barons joined the in|&s;urgents; Sir William Douglas was among the foremo&s;t openly to avow his attachment; while Robert Bruce more &s;ecretly favoured and promoted the cau&s;e. To oppo&s;e this un|expected in&s;urrection, the earl Warrenne col|lected an army of forty thou&s;and men in the north of England, and prepared to attack the Scots, who had by this time cro&s;&s;ed the bor|ders, and had begun to ravage the country. He &s;uddenly entered Annandale, and came up with the enemy at Irvine, where he &s;urprized their forces, who, being inferior in number, capitulated, and promi&s;ed to give ho&s;tages for their future fidelity. Mo&s;t of the nobility re|newed their oaths, and joined the Engli&s;h army with reluctance, waiting a more favourable oc|ca&s;ion for vindicating their freedom. Wallace alone di&s;dained &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; but, with his faith|ful followers, marched northwards, with a full intention to protract the hour of &s;lavery as long as he could. In the mean time, the earl of Warrenne advanced in the pur&s;uit, and overtook him, where he was advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted, in the neighbourhood of Stirling, on the other &s;ide of the river Forth. The earl
<PB N="37" REF="39">
perceiving the favourable ground he had cho|&s;en, was for declining the engagement; but being pre&s;&s;ed by Cre&s;&s;ingham; a proud man, who&s;e private revenge operated over his judg|ment, the old earl was at la&s;t obliged to com|ply, and he pa&s;&s;ed over a part of his army to begin the attack. Wallace allowing &s;uch num|bers of the Engli&s;h to get over as he thought him&s;elf &s;uperior to, boldly advanced upon them before they were completely formed, and put them entirely to the rout. Part of them were pur&s;ued into the river that lay in the rear, and the re&s;t were cut to pieces. Among the &s;lain was Cre&s;&s;ingham him&s;elf, who&s;e memory was &s;o extremely odious to the Scotch, that they flead his dead body, and made &s;addles of his &s;kin. Warrenne retired with the remains of his army to Berwick, while his pur&s;uers took &s;uch ca&s;tles, as were but ill provided for a &s;iege. Wallace returned into Scotland, after having thus, for a time, &s;aved his country, laden with an immen&s;e plunder, with which he for a while di&s;pelled the pro&s;pect of famine, that &s;eemed to threaten the nation.</P>
<P>Edward, who had been over in Flanders, while the&s;e misfortunes happened in England,<MILESTONE N="1297" UNIT="A.D."> ha&s;tened back with impatience to re&s;tore his
<PB N="38" REF="40">
authority, and &s;ecure his former conque&s;ts. As the di&s;contents of the people were not as yet entirely appea&s;ed, he took every popular mea&s;ure that he thought would give them &s;atis|faction. He re&s;tored to the citizens of London a power of electing their own magi&s;trates, of which they had been deprived in the latter part of his father's reign. He ordered &s;trict enquiries to be made concerning the quantity of corn, which he had arbitrarily &s;eized for the u&s;e of his armies, as if he intended to pay the value to the owners. Thus having ap|pea&s;ed, if not &s;atisfied, all complaints, he le|vied the whole force of his dominions; and at the head of an hundred thou&s;and men, he directed his march to the North, fully re&s;olved to take vengeance upon the Scots for their late defection.</P>
<P>It may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the Scots, even if united, were but ill able to re&s;i&s;t &s;uch an army, commanded by &s;uch a king; but their own mutual di&s;&s;en&s;ions &s;erved to render them &s;till more unequal to the conte&s;t, and to prepare Edward's way to an ea&s;y triumph. The Scotch were headed by three commanders, who each claimed an equal &s;hare of authority; the&s;e were the &s;teward of Scotland, Cum|min
<PB N="39" REF="41">
of Badenoch, and William Wallace, who offered to give up his command, but who&s;e party refu&s;ed to follow any other leader. The Scotch army was po&s;ted at Falkirk, and there propo&s;ed to abide the a&s;&s;ault of the Eng|li&s;h. They were drawn up in three &s;eparate divi&s;ions, each forming a complete body of pikemen, and the intervals filled up with archers. Their hor&s;e were placed in the rear, and their front was &s;ecured with pali&s;adoes.</P>
<P>Edward, tho' he &s;aw that the advantage of &s;itu|ation was again&s;t him, little regarded &s;uch a &s;u|periority, confident of his &s;kill and his numbers; wherefore, dividing his forces al&s;o into three bodies, he led them to the attack. Ju&s;t as he advanced at the head of his troops, the Scotch &s;et up &s;uch a &s;hout, that the hor&s;e, upon which the king rode, took fright, threw and afterwards kicked him on the ribs, as he lay on the ground; but the intrepid mo|narch, though &s;orely brui&s;ed with his fall, quickly mounted again with his u&s;ual alacrity, and ordered the Wel&s;h troops to begin the at|tack. The&s;e made but a feeble re&s;i&s;tance a|gain&s;t the Scotch, who fought with determined valour; but Edward &s;eeing them begin to de|cline, he advanced in per&s;on at the head of another batallion; and having pulled up the
<PB N="40" REF="42">
pali&s;adoes, charged the enemy with &s;uch an impetuo&s;ity, that they were no longer able to re&s;i&s;t. In this di&s;tre&s;s, Wallace did all that lay in the power of man to &s;u&s;tain and avert the &s;hock; but the divi&s;ion commanded by Cummin quitting the field, both the divi&s;ions of the lord &s;teward, as well as that of Wal|lace, lay expo&s;ed to the Engli&s;h archers, who at that time began to excel tho&s;e of all other nations. Wallace, for a while, maintained an unequal conte&s;t with his pikemen; but finding him&s;elf in danger of being &s;urrounded, he was at la&s;t obliged to give way, and &s;lowly to draw off the poor remnant of his troops behind the river Carron. Such was the famous battle of Falkirk, in which Edward gained a complete victory, leaving twelve thou&s;and of the Scotch, or, as &s;ome will have it, fifty thou&s;and, dead upon the field of battle, while the Engli&s;h had not an hundred &s;lain.</P>
<P>A blow &s;o dreadful, had not as yet entirely cru&s;hed the &s;pirit of the Scotch nation; and after a &s;hort interval, they began to breathe from their calamities.<MILESTONE N="1299" UNIT="A.D."> Wallace, who had gain|ed all their regards by his valour, &s;hewed that he &s;till merited them more by his declining the rewards of ambition. Perceiving how much he was envied by the nobility, and
<PB N="41" REF="43">
knowing how prejudicial that envy would prove to the intere&s;ts of his country, he re|&s;igned the regency of the kingdom, and hum|bled him&s;elf to a private &s;tation. He propo&s;|ed Cummin as the propere&s;t per&s;on to &s;upply his room; and that nobleman endeavoured to &s;hew him&s;elf worthy of this pre-eminence. He &s;oon began to annoy the enemy; and not con|tent with a defen&s;ive war, he made incur&s;ions into the Southern counties of the kingdom, which Edward had imagined wholly &s;ubdued.<MILESTONE N="1302" UNIT="A.D."> They attacked an army of the Engli&s;h lying at Ro&s;lin, near Edinburgh, and gained a com|plete victory. The renown of the Scotti&s;h arms &s;oon began to &s;pread di&s;may among the Engli&s;h garri&s;ons left in that kingdom; and they evacuated all the fortre&s;&s;es, of which they had for &s;ome time been put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Thus once more the ta&s;k of conque&s;t was to be per|formed over again; and in proportion to their lo&s;&s;es, the Scotch &s;eemed to gather fre&s;h ob|&s;tinacy.</P>
<P>But it was not ea&s;y for any circum&s;tances of bad fortune to repre&s;s the enterprizing &s;pirit of the king.<MILESTONE N="1303" UNIT="A.D."> He a&s;&s;embled a great fleet and army; and, entering the frontiers of Scotland, appeared with a force which the enemy could not think of re&s;i&s;ting in the open field. The
<PB N="42" REF="44">
fleet furni&s;hed the land army with all nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ions; while the&s;e marched &s;ecurely along, and traver&s;ed the kingdom from one end to the other, ravaging the open country, taking all the ca&s;tles, and receiving the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions of all the nobles. This complete conque&s;t, em|ployed Edward for the &s;pace of two years; but he &s;eemed, by the &s;everity of his conduct, to make the natives pay dear for the trouble to which they had put him. He abrogated all the Scotti&s;h laws and cu&s;toms; he endeavour|ed to &s;ub&s;titute tho&s;e of England in their place; he entirely razed or de&s;troyed all their monuments of antiquity; and endea|voured to blot out even the memory of their former independence and freedom. There &s;eem|ed to remain only one ob&s;tacle to the final de&s;truction of the Scotti&s;h monarchy, and that was William Wallace, who &s;till continued re|fractory; and wandering with a few forces from mountain to mountain, &s;till pre&s;erved his native independence and u&s;ual good fortune. But even their feeble hopes from him were &s;oon di&s;appointed; he was betrayed into the king's hands by Sir John Monteith, his friend, whom he had made acquainted with the place of his concealment, being &s;urprized by him as he lay a&s;leep in the neighbourhood of Gla&s;|gow.
<PB N="43" REF="45">
The king, willing to &s;trike the Scotch with an example of &s;everity, ordered him to be conducted in chains to London, whither he was carried amid&s;t infinite crowds of &s;pec|tators, who flocked to &s;ee a man that had of|ten filled the whole country with con&s;terna|tion. On the day after his arrival, he was brought to his trial, as a traitor, at We&s;tmin|&s;ter-Hall, where he was placed upon an high chair, and crowned with laurel in deri&s;ion. Be|ing accu&s;ed of various imputed crimes, he pleaded not guilty, and refu&s;ed to own the juri&s;diction of the court, affirming, that it was equally unju&s;t and ab&s;urd to charge him with trea&s;on again&s;t a prince who&s;e title he had never acknowledged; and as he was born un|der the laws of another country, it was cruel to try him by tho&s;e to which he was a &s;tranger. The judges di&s;regarded his defence; for con|&s;idering Edward as the immediate &s;overeign of Scotland, they found him guilty of high-trea&s;on, and condemned him to be hanged, drawn, and quartered, the u&s;ual puni&s;hment for &s;uch of|fences. This &s;entence was executed with the mo&s;t rigorous punctuality; and his head and quarters were expo&s;ed in the chief cities of England. Such was the wretched end of a brave man, who had through a cour&s;e of many
<PB N="44" REF="46">
years, with &s;ignal per&s;everance and conduct, defended his native country again&s;t an unju&s;t invader.</P>
<P>Robert Bruce was among tho&s;e on whom the cruel fate of Wallace had made the deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;ion. This nobleman, whom we have already &s;een as competitor for the crown, and who&s;e claims, though &s;et a&s;ide by Edward, were &s;till &s;ecretly pur&s;ued, was now actually in the Engli&s;h army. He never was &s;incerely attached to the Engli&s;h monarch, whom he was in &s;ome mea&s;ure compelled to follow; and an interview with Wallace, &s;ometime before that champion was taken, confirmed him in his re&s;olution to &s;et his country free. But as he was now grown old and infirm, he was obliged to give up the flattering ambition of being the deliverer of his people, and to leave it in charge to his &s;on, who&s;e name was Robert Bruce al&s;o, and who conceived the project with ardour. This young nobleman was brave, active, and prudent; and a favourable con|juncture of circum&s;tances &s;eemed to con&s;pire with his aims. John Baliol, whom Edward had dethroned, and bani&s;hed into France, had lately died in that country; his elde&s;t &s;on conti|nued a captive in the &s;ame place; there was none to di&s;pute his preten&s;ions, except Cummin, who
<PB N="45" REF="47">
was regent of the kingdom; and he al&s;o was &s;oon after brought over to &s;econd his intere&s;ts. He, therefore, re&s;olved upon freeing his coun|try from the Engli&s;h yoke; and although he attended the court of Edward, yet he began to make &s;ecret preparations for his intended revolt. Edward, who had been informed not only of his intentions, but of his actual en|gagements, contented him&s;elf with &s;etting &s;pies round him to watch his conduct, and ordered all his motions to be &s;trictly guarded. Bruce was &s;till bu&s;ily employed in his endeavours, uncon&s;cious of being &s;u&s;pected, or even of having guardians &s;et upon his conduct; but he was taught to under&s;tand his danger, by a pre|&s;ent &s;ent him, by a young nobleman of his ac|quaintance of a pair of gilt &s;purs, and a pur&s;e of gold. This he con&s;idered as a warning to make his e&s;cape, which he did, by ordering his hor&s;es to be &s;hod with their &s;hoes turned backwards, to prevent his being tracked in the &s;now, which had then fallen.</P>
<P>His di&s;patch was con&s;idered then as very great; <MILESTONE N="1306" UNIT="A.D."> having travelled from London to Loachmaban, which is near four hundred miles, in &s;even days. Cummin, who had in the be|ginning concurred in his &s;chemes, was private|ly known to have communicated the whole to
<PB N="46" REF="48">
Edward; and Bruce was re&s;olved, in the fir&s;t place, to take vengeance upon him for his perfidy. Hearing that he was then at Dum|fries, he went thither, and meeting him in the cloi&s;ters of a mona&s;tery belonging to the Grey Friars, reproached him, in &s;evere terms, with his treachery; and drawing his &s;word, in&s;tantly plunged it in his brea&s;t. Sir Thomas Kirk|patrick, one of Bruce's friends, a&s;king him &s;oon after if the traitor was &s;lain, and Bruce an&s;we|ring that he believed &s;o, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"what, replied the other, only belief; I will &s;ecure him;"</Q> and and going back to where Cummin was receiv|ing ab&s;olution at the altar, he &s;tabbed him to the heart. It is a di&s;agreeable reflexion, that actions begun in this manner &s;hould, never|thele&s;s, terminate in &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Bruce had by this action not only rendered him&s;elf the object of Edward's re&s;entment, but involved all his party in the &s;ame guilt. They had now no re&s;ource left, but to con|firm, by de&s;perate valour, what they had be|gun in cruelty; and they &s;oon expelled &s;uch of the Engli&s;h forces, as had fixed them&s;elves in the kingdom. Bruce was &s;olemnly crowned king, by the bi&s;hop of St. Andrew's, in the abbey of Scone; and numbers flocked to his &s;tandard, re&s;olved to confirm his preten|&s;ions.
<PB N="47" REF="49">
Thus, after twice conquering the king|dom, and as often pardoning the delinquents; after having &s;pread his victories in every quar|ter of the country, and receiving the mo&s;t hum|ble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, the old king &s;aw, that his whole work was to begin afre&s;h; and that no|thing but the final de&s;truction of the inhabitants could give him a&s;&s;urance of tranquility. But no difficulties could repre&s;s the arduous &s;pirit of this monarch, who, tho' now verging towards his decline, yet re&s;olved to &s;trike a parting blow, and to make the Scotch once more tremble at his appearance. He vowed revenge again&s;t the whole nation; and averred, that nothing but reducing them to the complete&s;t bondage could &s;atisfy his re&s;entment. He &s;ummoned his pre|lates, nobility, and all who held by knights &s;ervice, to meet him at Carli&s;le, which was ap|pointed as the general rendezvous; and, in the mean time, he detached a body of forces before him into Scotland, under the command of Aymer de Valence, who began the threatened infliction by a terrible victory over Bruce, near Methuen, in Perth&s;hire. That warlike com|mander fought with great ob&s;tinacy; he was thrice di&s;mounted from his hor&s;e in the action, and as often recovered: but at la&s;t he was obliged to fly, and take &s;helter, with a few
<PB N="48" REF="50">
followers, in the We&s;tern I&s;les. The earl of Athole, Sir Simon Fra&s;er, and Sir Chri&s;topher Seton, who had been taken pri&s;oners, were executed as traitors on the &s;pot. Immedi|ately after this dreadful blow, the re&s;entful king him&s;elf appeared in per&s;on, entering Scot|land with his army divided into two parts, and expecting to find, in the oppo&s;ition of the peo|ple, a pretext for puni&s;hing them. But this brave prince, who was never cruel but from motives of policy, could not &s;trike the poor &s;ubmitting natives, who made no re&s;i&s;tance. His anger was di&s;appointed in their humilia|tions; and he was a&s;hamed to extirpate tho&s;e, who only oppo&s;ed patience to his indignation. It was chiefly upon the nobles of the country that the weight of his re&s;entment fell. The &s;i&s;ter of Bruce, and the counte&s;s of Buchan, were &s;hut up in wooden cages, and hung over the battlements of a fortre&s;s, and his two bro|thers fell by the hands of the executioner. The ob&s;tinacy of this commander &s;erved to in|flame the king's re&s;entment. He &s;till conti|nued to excite fre&s;h commotions in the High|lands; and, though often overcome, per|&s;i&s;ted in a &s;eemingly fruitle&s;s oppo&s;ition. Ed|ward therefore, at la&s;t, re&s;olved to give no quarter; and at the head of a great army
<PB N="49" REF="51">
entered Scotland, from whence he had lately retreated, re&s;olving to exterminate the whole body of tho&s;e in&s;urgents, who &s;eemed &s;o impla|cably aver&s;e to his government. Nothing lay before the refractory Scotch, but pro&s;pects of the mo&s;t &s;peedy and terrible vengeance; while neither their valour, nor their mountains, were found to grant them any permanent protection. But Edward's death put an end to their appre|hen&s;ions, and effectually re&s;cued their country from total &s;ubjection. He &s;ickened, and died at Carli&s;le, of a dy&s;entery; enjoining his &s;on, with his la&s;t breath, to pro&s;ecute the enterprize, and never to de&s;i&s;t, till he had finally &s;ubdued the kingdom. He expired,<MILESTONE N="1307, July 7." UNIT="A.D."> in the &s;ixty-ninth year of his age, and the thirty-fifth of his reign: after having added more to the &s;olid intere&s;ts of the kingdom, than any of tho&s;e who went before, or &s;ince &s;ucceeded him. He was a promoter of the happine&s;s of the people; and &s;eldom attempted exerting any arbitrary &s;tretch of power, but with a pro&s;pect of encrea&s;ing the welfare of his &s;ubjects. He was of a very maje&s;tic appearance, tall in &s;tature, of regular features, with keen piercing black eyes, and an a&s;pect that commanded reverence and e&s;teem. His con&s;titution was robu&s;t; his &s;trength and dexterity unequalled, and his
<PB N="50" REF="52">
&s;hape agreeable except from the extreme length and &s;mallne&s;s of his legs, from whence he had the appellation of Long&s;hanks. He &s;eemed to have united all tho&s;e advantages which, in that age, might be con&s;idered as true glory. He gained renown by his piety in the Holy Land; he fixed the limits of ju&s;tice at home; he confirmed the rights of the people; he was the mo&s;t expert at martial exerci&s;es of any man in the kingdom; and was allowed to be a conque|ror, by his &s;ucce&s;s over the kingdom of Scotland. Succeeding times have, with great ju&s;tice, que&s;|tioned the merit of &s;ome of the&s;e claims; but none can deny him comparative excellence, if they look upon tho&s;e princes, who either went before, or have &s;ucceeded. Edward, by his fir&s;t wife, Eleanor of Ca&s;tile, had four &s;ons, and eleven daughters; of the la&s;t, mo&s;t died young; of the former, Edward the &s;econd alone, his heir and &s;ucce&s;&s;or, &s;urvived him.</P>
<P>If we turn to the &s;tate of the people du|ring his admini&s;tration, we &s;hall find, that England acquired not only great power, but great happine&s;s, under his protection. The barons, who might, during this period, be con&s;idered as a junto of petty tyrants, ready to cry out for liberty, which they alone were to &s;hare, were kept under; and their com|binations
<PB N="51" REF="53">
were but feeble and ill &s;upported. The monarch was in &s;ome mea&s;ure ab&s;olute, though he was prudent enough not to exert his power. He was &s;evere, indeed; and &s;ome people tax this &s;everity as a &s;tain upon his memory; but let it be remembered, that he was the fir&s;t who began to di&s;tribute indi&s;criminate ju&s;tice. Be|fore his time, the people who ro&s;e in in&s;urrec|tions were puni&s;hed in the mo&s;t cruel man|ner, by the &s;word of the gibbet; while, at the &s;ame time, the nobility, who were really guilty, were treated with a degree of lenity, which encouraged them to fre&s;h in&s;urrections. But what gave Edward's reign a true value with po&s;|terity, was the degree of power, which the peo|ple began to a&s;&s;ume during this period. The king con&s;idered the clergy and barons in &s;ome mea&s;ure as rivals; and to weaken their force, he never attempted to control the &s;low, but certain, advances made by the people, which, in time, entirely de&s;troyed the power of the one, and divided the authority of the other.</P>

</FIGURE>CHAP. XIII. EDWARD II. &s;urnamed of CAERNARVON.</HEAD>
<P>THE plea&s;ure which the people generally feel at the acce&s;&s;ion of a new prince, effaces their &s;orrow for the decea&s;ed; the faults of the one are known and hated, while the other, from novelty, receives imputed merit. Much, therefore, was expected from the young prince, and all orders ha&s;tened to take the oath of al|legiance to him. He was now in the twenty-third
<PB N="53" REF="55">
year of his age, of an agreeable figure, of a mild harmle&s;s di&s;po&s;ition, and apparently addicted to few vices. But he &s;oon gave &s;ymp|toms of his unfitne&s;s to &s;ucceed &s;o great a monarch as his father; he was rather fond of the enjoyment of his power, than of &s;ecuring it; and, lulled by the flattery of his courtiers, he thought he had done enough for glory, when he had accepted the crown. In&s;tead, there|fore, of pro&s;ecuting the war again&s;t Scotland, according to the injunctions he had received from his dying father, he took no &s;teps to check the progre&s;s of Bruce; his march into that country being rather a proce&s;|&s;ion of pageantry, than a warlike expedition. Bruce, no longer dreading a great conqueror in the field, boldly i&s;&s;ued from his retreats, and even obtained a con&s;iderable advan|tage over Aymer de Valence, who com|manded the Engli&s;h forces. Young Edward looked tamely on; and, in&s;tead of repre&s;&s;ing the enemy, endeavoured to come to an accom|modation. The Engli&s;h barons, who had been kept under during the preceding reign, now &s;aw that the &s;cepter was fallen into &s;uch feeble hands,<MILESTONE N="1307" UNIT="A.D."> that they might re-a&s;&s;ert their former independence with impunity.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="56">To confirm the inau&s;picious conjectures that were already formed of this reign, Edward re|called one of his favourites, who was bani&s;hed during his father's reign, being accu&s;ed of cor|rupting the prince's morals. The name of this much loved youth was Piers Gave&s;tone, the &s;on of a Ga&s;con knight, who had been employed in the &s;ervice of the late king. This young man &s;oon in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the affections of the prince; and, in fact, was adorned with every accompli&s;hment of per&s;on and mind, that were capable of creating af|fection: but he was utterly de&s;titute of tho&s;e qualities of heart and under&s;tanding that &s;erve to procure e&s;teem. He was beautiful, witty, brave, and active; but then he was vicious, effeminate, debauched, and trifling. The&s;e were qualities entirely adapted to the ta&s;te of the young monarch, and &s;uch as he could not think of living without. He there|fore took Gave&s;tone into his particular inti|macy, and &s;eemed to think no rewards equal to his de&s;erts. Even before his arrival at court from exile, he endowed him with the whole earldom of Cornwal, which had lately fallen to the crown. He married him &s;oon after to his own niece, and granted him a &s;um of two and thirty thou&s;and pounds, which the late
<PB N="55" REF="57">
king had re&s;erved for the maintenance of one hundred and forty knights, who had under|taken to carry his heart to Jeru&s;alem.</P>
<P>The&s;e accumulated favours did not fail to excite the jealou&s;y and indignation of the ba|rons; and Gave&s;tone was no way &s;olicitous to &s;often their re&s;entment. Intoxicated with his power, he became haughty and overbearing. He treated the Engli&s;h nobility, from whom it is probable he received marks of contempt, with &s;corn and deri&s;ion. Whenever there was to be a di&s;play of pomp or magnificence, Gave&s;tone was &s;ure to eclip&s;e all others; and he not only mortified his rivals by his &s;uperior &s;plendour, but his by &s;uperior in&s;olence.</P>
<P>The barons were &s;oon after &s;till more pro|voked to &s;ee this pre&s;umptuous favourite ap|pointed guardian of the realm, during a journey the king was obliged to make to Pa|ris, to e&s;pou&s;e the prince&s;s I&s;abella, to whom he had been long &s;ince betrothed. They were not remi&s;s, therefore, upon the arrival of this prince&s;s, who was imperious and intriguing, to make her of their party, and to direct her animo&s;ity again&s;t Gave&s;tone, which, to do him ju&s;tice, he took little care to avoid. A con|&s;piracy was &s;oon formed again&s;t him, at the head of which queen I&s;abella, and the earl of
<PB N="56" REF="58">
Lanca&s;ter, a nobleman of great power, were a&s;&s;ociated. They bound them&s;elves by oath to expel Gave&s;tone; and began to throw off all reverence for the royal authority, which they &s;aw wholly in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this over|grown favourite. At length, the king found him&s;elf obliged to &s;ubmit to their united cla|mour; and he &s;ent Gave&s;tone out of the king|dom, by appointing him lord-lieutenant of Ireland. But this compliance was of &s;hort duration; the weak monarch, long habituated to his favourite, could not live without him; and having obtained a di&s;pen&s;ation from the pope for his breach of faith, he once more re|called Gave&s;tone, and even went down to Che&s;ter to receive him on his fir&s;t landing from Ireland. A parliament was &s;oon after a&s;&s;embled, where the king had influence &s;uf|ficient to have his late conduct approved; and this &s;erved only to encrea&s;e his ridicu|lous affection, and to render Gave&s;tone &s;till more odious. This infatuated creature him|&s;elf forgetting his pa&s;t misfortunes, and un|mindful of future danger, re&s;umed his former o&s;tentation and in&s;olence, and made him&s;elf every day &s;ome new enemy.</P>
<P>It was ea&s;y to perceive, that a combination of the nobles, while the queen &s;ecretly a&s;&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="57" REF="59">
their de&s;igns, would be too powerful again&s;t the efforts of a weak king, and a vain favourite. They were re&s;olved upon the fall of Gave&s;tone, even though that of Edward him&s;elf &s;hould be involved in the &s;ame ruin. They &s;oon, there|fore, a&s;&s;embled, in a tumultuary parliament, contrary to the king's expre&s;s command, attend|ed with a numerous retinue of armed follow|ers; and began their fir&s;t u&s;urpations, by giving laws to the king.<MILESTONE N="1308. March 16." UNIT="A.D."> They compelled him to &s;ign a commi&s;&s;ion, by which the whole authority of government was to be delegated to twelve per&s;ons, to be cho&s;en by them&s;elves. The&s;e were to have the government of the king|dom, and the regulation of the king's hou&s;e|hold. They were to enact ordinances for the good of the &s;tate, and the honour of the king, their commi&s;&s;ion was to continue for &s;ix months, and then they were to lay down their autho|rity. Many of their ordinances were accord|ingly put in force, and &s;ome of them appear|ed for the advantage of the nation; &s;uch as the requiring that the &s;heriffs &s;hould be men of pro|perty; the prohibiting the adulteration of the coin; the excluding foreigners from farming the revenues; and the revoking all the late exorbi|tant grants of the crown. All the&s;e the king, who &s;aw him&s;elf entirely &s;tript of his power,
<PB N="58" REF="60">
could very patiently &s;ubmit to; but when he learned that Gave&s;tone was to be bani&s;hed for ever from his dominions, he no longer was ma&s;ter of his temper; but removing to York, where he was at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the im|mediate terror of the confederated power, he in&s;tantly invited Gave&s;tone back from Flanders, whither the barons had bani&s;hed him; and de|claring his puni&s;hment and &s;entence to be ille|gal, he openly rein&s;tated him in all his former &s;plendours.<MILESTONE N="1312" UNIT="A.D."> This was &s;ufficient to &s;pread an alarm over the whole kingdom; all the great barons flew to arms; the earl of Lanca&s;ter put him&s;elf at the head of this irre&s;i&s;tible confede|racy; Guy, earl of Warwick, entered into it with fury; the earl of Hereford, the earl of Pembroke, and the earl Warenne, all embra|ced the &s;ame cau&s;e; whil&s;t the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury brought over the majority of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, and con&s;equently of the people. The unhappy Edward, in&s;tead of attempting to make re&s;i&s;tance, &s;ought only for &s;afety: ever happy in the company of his favourite, he em|barked at Tinmouth, and &s;ailed with him to the ca&s;tle of Scarborough, where he left Gave&s;tone, as in a place of &s;afety; and then went back to York him&s;elf, either to rai&s;e an army to op|po&s;e his enemies; or, by his pre&s;ence, to allay
<PB N="59" REF="61">
their animo&s;ity. In the mean time, Gave&s;tone was be&s;ieged in Scarborough by the earl of Pembroke; and had the garri&s;on been &s;uffici|ently &s;upplied with provi&s;ions, that place would have been impregnable. But Gave&s;tone, &s;en|&s;ible of the bad condition of the garri&s;on, took the earlie&s;t opportunity to offer terms of capi|tulation. He &s;tipulated, that he &s;hould remain in Pembroke's hands as a pri&s;oner for two months; and that endeavours &s;hould be u&s;ed, in the mean time, for a general accommodation. But Pembroke had no intention that he &s;hould e&s;|cape &s;o ea&s;ily; he ordered him to be conduct|ed to the ca&s;tle of Deddington, near Banbury, where, on pretence of other bu&s;ine&s;s, he left him with a feeble guard, which the earl of Warwick having notice of, he attacked the ca&s;tle in which the unfortunate Gave&s;tone was confined, and quickly made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of his per&s;on. The earls of Lanca&s;ter, Hereford, and Arundel, were &s;oon apprized of War|wick's &s;ucce&s;s, and informed that their common enemy was now in cu&s;tody at Warwick ca&s;tle. Thither, therefore, they ha&s;ted with the ut|mo&s;t expedition, to hold a con&s;ultation upon the fate of their pri&s;oner. This was of no long continuance; they unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved to put him to death, as an enemy to the king|dom,
<PB N="60" REF="62">
and gave him no time to prepare for his execution. They in&s;tantly had him conveyed to a place called Blacklowhill, where a Welch executioner, provided for that purpo&s;e, &s;evered the head from the body. There appeared a deeper &s;pirit of cruelty now entering in|to the nation, than had been known in times of barbarity and ignorance. It is probable, that the mutual &s;laughters committed by the Chri&s;tians and Saracens upon each other, in the Cru&s;ades, made the people familiar with blood; and taught chri&s;tians to butcher each other with the &s;ame alacrity with which they were &s;een to de&s;troy infidels, to whom they &s;el|dom gave any quarter.</P>
<P>The king, at fir&s;t, &s;eemed to feel all the re|&s;entment which &s;o &s;en&s;ible an injury could pro|duce; but equally weak in his attachment and his revenge, he was &s;oon appea&s;ed, and grant|ed the perpetrators a free pardon, upon their making a &s;hew of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and repentance. An apparent tranquility was once more e&s;ta|bli&s;hed among the contending parties; and that re&s;entment which they had exerci&s;ed upon each other, was now converted again&s;t the Scotch, who were con&s;idered as the common enemy. A war had been declared &s;ome time before with this nation, in order to recover
<PB N="61" REF="63">
that authority over them, which had been e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in the former reign, and a truce was &s;oon after concluded; but the terms of it being ill ob&s;erved on both &s;ides, the animo&s;ities were kindled afre&s;h, and the whole military force of England was called out by the king, together with very large reinforcements, as well from the continent, as other parts of the Engli&s;h domini|ons. Edward's army amounted to an hundred thou&s;and men; while Bruce, king of Scotland, could bring but a body of thirty thou&s;and to oppo&s;e him. Both armies met at a place call|ed Banockburn, in the kingdom of Scotland, within two miles of Stirling; the one confident in numbers, the other relying wholly on their advantageous po&s;ition. Bruce had a hill on his right flank, and a bog on his left; with a rivulet in front, on the banks of which he had cau&s;ed &s;everal deep pits to be dug, with &s;harp &s;takes driven into them, and the whole carefully concealed from the view of the enemy. The on&s;et was made by the Engli&s;h; and a very furious engagement en&s;ued between the caval|ry on both &s;ides. The fortune and intrepidity of Bruce gave the fir&s;t turn to the day. He engaged in &s;ingle combat with Henry de Bo|hun, a gentleman of the family of Hereford; and at one &s;troke clove his &s;kull with his battle|ax
<PB N="62" REF="64">
to the chine. So favourable a beginning was only interrupted by the night; but the battle renewing at the dawn of the en&s;uing day, the Engli&s;h cavalry once more attempted to attack the Scotch army; but unexpectedly found them&s;elves entangled among tho&s;e pits which Bruce had previou&s;ly made to receive them. The earl of Glouce&s;ter, the king's ne|phew, was overthrown and &s;lain: this &s;erved to intimidate the whole Engli&s;h army; and they were &s;oon &s;till more alarmed by the appearance of a fre&s;h army, as they &s;uppo&s;ed it to be, that was preparing, from a neighbouring height, to fall upon them in the rear. This was only compo&s;ed of waggoners and attendants upon the Scotti&s;h camp; who had been &s;upplied by the king, with &s;tandards, and ordered to make as formidable an appearance as they could. The &s;tratagem took effect; the Engli&s;h, intimidated by their lo&s;&s;es, and di&s;tracted by their fears, began to fly on all &s;ides; and throwing away their arms, were pur&s;ued with great &s;laughter, as far as Berwick.</P>
<P>Edward him&s;elf narrowly e&s;caped by flight to Dunbar, where he was received by the earl of Marche, and thence conveyed in &s;afety by &s;ea to Berwick. This battle was deci&s;ive in fa|vour of the Scotch. It &s;ecured the indepen|dence
<PB N="63" REF="65">
of the crown of that kingdom; and &s;uch was the influence of &s;o great a defeat upon the minds of the Engli&s;h, that for &s;ome years after no &s;uperiority of numbers could induce them to keep the field again&s;t their formidable adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>Want of &s;ucce&s;s is ever attended with want of authority.<MILESTONE N="1314" UNIT="A.D."> The king having &s;uffered not only a defeat from the Scotch, but al&s;o hav|ing been weakened by &s;everal in&s;urrections among the Wel&s;h and Iri&s;h, found his greate&s;t afflictions &s;till remaining in the turbulence and in&s;olence of his &s;ubjects at home. The nobi|lity, ever factious, now took the advantage of his feeble &s;ituation to depre&s;s his power, and re-e&s;tabli&s;h their own. The earl of Lanca&s;ter, and tho&s;e of his party, no &s;ooner &s;aw the un|fortunate monarch return with di&s;grace, than they renewed their demands, and were rein|&s;tated in their former power of governing the kingdom. It was declared, that all offices &s;hould be filled from time to time by the votes of parliament, which, as they were influenced by the great barons, the&s;e effectually took all government into their own hands. Thus, from every new calamity, the &s;tate &s;uffered; the barons acquired new power; and their aims were not &s;o much to repre&s;s the enemies
<PB N="64" REF="66">
of their country, as to foment new animo&s;i|ties, and &s;trengthen every foreign confede|racy.</P>
<P>A confirmed oppo&s;ition generally produces an oppo&s;ite combination. The king finding him&s;elf thus &s;teadily counteracted in all his aims, had no other re&s;ource but in another favourite, on whom he repo&s;ed all confidence, and from who&s;e connexions he hoped for a&s;|&s;i&s;tance. The name of this new favourite was Hugh De&s;pen&s;er, a young man of a noble Engli&s;h family, of &s;ome merit, and very en|gaging accompli&s;hments. His father was a per&s;on of a much more e&s;timable character than the &s;on; he was venerable from his years, and re&s;pected through life for his wi&s;dom, his valour, and his integrity. But the&s;e excellent qualities were all dimini&s;hed and vilified, from the mo|ment he and his &s;on began to &s;hare the king's favour. The turbulent barons, and Lanca&s;ter at their head, regarded him as a rival, and taught the people to de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e accompli&s;h|ments that only &s;erved to eclip&s;e their own. The king, equally weak and unju&s;t in his attach|ments, in&s;tead of profiting by the wi&s;dom of his favourites, endeavoured to &s;trengthen him|&s;elf by their power. For this purpo&s;e he married the younger Spen&s;er to his niece; he
<PB N="65" REF="67">
&s;ettled upon him &s;ome very large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the marches of Wales; and even di&s;po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome lords unju&s;tly of their e&s;tates, in order to accumulate them upon his favourite. This was a pretext the king's enemies had been long &s;eeking for; the earls of Lanca&s;ter and Hereford flew to arms; and the lords Audley and Ammori, who had been di&s;po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, joined them with all their forces. Their fir&s;t mea&s;ure was to require the king to di&s;mi&s;s or confine his favourite, the young Spen&s;er, menacing him, in ca&s;e of a refu&s;al, with a de|termination to obtain by force, what &s;hould be denied to their importunities. This reque&s;t was &s;carce made, when they began to &s;hew their re&s;olution to have redre&s;s, by pillaging and de&s;troying the lands of young Spen&s;er, and burning his hou&s;es. The e&s;tates of the father &s;oon after &s;hared the &s;ame fate; and the in&s;ur|gents having thus &s;atiated them&s;elves with the plunder of this mo&s;t opulent family, marched up to London, to inflict with their own hands, that puni&s;hment which had been denied to their remon&s;trances. Finding a free entrance into the city, they &s;o intimidated the parliament that was then &s;itting, that a &s;entence was procured of per|petual exile again&s;t the two Spen&s;ers, and a for|feiture of their fortune and e&s;tates. But an
<PB N="66" REF="68">
act of this kind, extorted by violence, was not likely to bind the king any longer than nece&s;&s;i|ty compelled him. Some time after, having a&s;&s;embled a &s;mall army to puni&s;h one of the barons, who had offered an indignity to the queen, he thought it a convenient opportunity to take revenge on all his enemies at once, and to recal the two Spen&s;ers, who&s;e company he &s;o ardently de&s;ired. In this manner the civil war was kindled afre&s;h, and the country once more involved in all the horrors of &s;laughter and deva&s;tation.</P>
<P>The king had now got the &s;tart of his ad|ver&s;aries, and ha&s;tened by forced marches to|wards the borders of Wales, where the ene|my's chief power lay. Lanca&s;ter, however, was not &s;low in making head again&s;t him; hav|ing &s;ummoned together all his va&s;&s;als and re|tainers, and being joined by the earl of Here|ford. Still farther to &s;trengthen his party, he formed an alliance with the king of Scotland, with whom he had long been privately con|nected. But his diligence on this occa&s;ion proved ineffectual; the king at the head of thirty thou&s;and men pre&s;&s;ed him &s;o clo&s;ely, that he had not time to collect his forces toge|ther; and, flying from one place to another, he was at la&s;t &s;topt in his way towards Scot|land
<PB N="67" REF="69">
by Sir Andrew Harcla, who repul&s;ed his forces in a &s;kirmi&s;h in which the earl of Here|ford was &s;lain, and Lanca&s;ter him&s;elf taken pri&s;oner. As he had formerly &s;hewn little mercy to Gave&s;ton, there was very little ex|tended to him upon this occa&s;ion. He was condemned by a court-martial; and led, mounted on a lean hor&s;e, to an eminence near Pomfret, in circum&s;tances of the greate&s;t indig|nity, where he was beheaded by a Londoner. The people, with whom he had once been a favourite, &s;eemed to have quite for&s;aken him in his di&s;grace; they reviled him, as he was led to execution, with every kind of reproach; and even his own va&s;&s;als &s;eemed eager to remove &s;u&s;picion by their being foremo&s;t to in&s;ult his di&s;tre&s;s. About eighteen more of the principal in&s;urgents were afterwards con|demned and executed in a more legal manner, while others found &s;afety by e&s;caping to the continent.</P>
<P>A rebellion, thus cru&s;hed, &s;erved only to encrea&s;e the pride and rapacity of young Spen&s;er; mo&s;t of the forfeitures were &s;eized for his u&s;e; and in his promptitude to pu|ni&s;h the delinquents, he was found guilty of many acts of rapine and inju&s;tice. He him|&s;elf laid the train for his own future misfor|tunes,
<PB N="68" REF="70">
and an occa&s;ion &s;oon offered for putting it into effect again&s;t him.<MILESTONE N="1324" UNIT="A.D."> The king of France, taking the advantage of Edward's weakne&s;s, re&s;olved to confi&s;cate all his foreign domi|nions. After a fruitle&s;s emba&s;&s;y from Edward, to di&s;&s;uade that monarch from his purpo&s;e, the queen of England her&s;elf de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to go over to the court of France, to endeavour to a|vert the &s;torm. The French king, tho' he gave her the kinde&s;t reception, was re&s;olved to li&s;ten to no accommodation, unle&s;s Edward in per&s;on &s;hould appear, and do him homage for the domi|nions he held under him. This was reckoned a very dangerous &s;tep; and what the king of Eng|land could not think of complying with, nor what his favourite Spen&s;er was willing to permit. In this exigence, the queen &s;tarted a new expe|dient, which &s;eemed calculated to get rid of all difficulties. It was, that Edward &s;hould re&s;ign the dominion of Guienne to his &s;on, now thir|teen years of age; and that the young prince &s;hould go to Paris, to pay that homage which had been required of the father. With this propo&s;al all parties agreed; young Edward was &s;ent to Paris; and the queen, an haughty and ambitious woman, having thus got her &s;on in her power, was re&s;olved to detain him till her own aims were complied with. Among the
<PB N="69" REF="71">
number of the&s;e, was the expul&s;ion of the Spen|&s;ers, again&s;t whom &s;he had conceived a vio|lent hatred, from their great influence over the king.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this re&s;olution, &s;he pro|tracted the negociation for &s;ome time, and be|ing at la&s;t required by the king to return, &s;he replied, that &s;he would never again appear in England, till Spen&s;er was removed from the royal pre&s;ence and bani&s;hed the kingdom. By this reply, &s;he gained two very con&s;iderable advantages; &s;he became popular in England, where Spen&s;er was univer&s;ally di&s;liked; and &s;he had the plea&s;ure of enjoying the company of a young nobleman, who&s;e name was Mor|timer, upon whom &s;he had lately placed her affections. This youth had, in &s;ome former in&s;urrection, been condemned for high trea|&s;on, but had the &s;entence commuted into perpetual impri&s;onment in the Tower. From thence, however, he had the good fortune to e&s;cape into France, and &s;oon became di&s;|tingui&s;hed among his party for his violent animo&s;ity to Spen&s;er. The graces of his per|&s;on and addre&s;s, but particularly his di&s;like to the favourite, rendered him very ac|ceptable to the queen; &s;o that, from being a partizan, he became a lover, and was indulged
<PB N="70" REF="72">
with all the familiarities that her criminal pa&s;|&s;ion could confer. The queen's court now, therefore, became a &s;anctuary for all the malecontents who were bani&s;hed their own country, or who cho&s;e to come over. A corre&s;pondence was &s;ecretly carried on with the di&s;contented at home; and nothing now was aimed at, but to de&s;troy the favourites, and dethrone the king.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1325" UNIT="A.D."> To &s;econd the queen's efforts, many of the principal nobles prepared their va&s;&s;als, and loudly declared again&s;t the favourite. The king's brother, the earl of Kent, was led in to engage among the re&s;t; the earl of Norfolk was prevailed upon, to enter &s;ecretly into the con&s;piracy. The brother and heir to the earl of Lanca&s;ter, was from principle attached to the cau&s;e; the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury ex|pre&s;&s;ed his approbation of the queen's mea|&s;ures; and the minds of the people were en|flamed by all tho&s;e arts, which the de&s;igning practi&s;e upon the weak and ignorant. In this univer&s;al di&s;po&s;ition to rebel, the queen prepared for her expedition; and, accompa|nied by three thou&s;and men at arms, &s;et out from Dort harbour, and landed &s;afely, without oppo&s;ition, on the coa&s;t of Suffolk. She no &s;ooner appeared, than there &s;eemed a general
<PB N="71" REF="73">
revolt in her favour; three prelates, the bi|&s;hops of Ely, Lincoln, and Hereford, brought her all their va&s;&s;als; and Robert de Watteville, who had been &s;ent to oppo&s;e her progre&s;s, de|&s;erted to her with all his forces.</P>
<P>In this exigence, the unfortunate Edward vainly attempted to collect his friends, and bring the malecontents to their duty; he was obliged to leave the capital to the re&s;entment of the prevailing party; and the populace, immediately upon his de&s;ertion, flew out into tho&s;e exce&s;&s;es which are the con&s;equence of brutality unre&s;trained by fear. They &s;eized the bi&s;hop of Exeter, as he was pa&s;&s;ing through the city, beheaded him without any form of tri|al, and threw his body into the Thames. They al&s;o &s;eized upon the Tower, and agreed to &s;hew no mercy to any who &s;hould oppo&s;e their at|tempts. In the mean time, the king found the &s;pirit of di&s;loyalty was not confined to the capital alone, but diffu&s;ed over the whole king|dom. He had placed &s;ome dependence upon the garri&s;on which was &s;tationed in the ca&s;tle of Bri&s;tol, under the command of the elder Spen&s;er; but they mutinied again&s;t their go|vernor, and that unfortunate favourite was de|livered up, and condemned by the tumultuous barons to the mo&s;t ignominious death. He
<PB N="72" REF="74">
was hanged on a gibbet in his armour, his body was cut in pieces and thrown to the dogs, and his head was &s;ent to Winche&s;ter, where it was &s;et on a pole, and expo&s;ed to the in&s;ults of the populace. Thus died the elder Spen&s;er, in his ninetieth year, who&s;e character even the malevolence of party could not tarni&s;h. He had pa&s;&s;ed a youth of tranquility and reputation; but his fond compliance with his &s;on's am|bition, at length involved his age in ruin, though not di&s;grace.</P>
<P>Young Spen&s;er, the unhappy &s;on, did not long &s;urvive the father; he was taken with &s;ome others who had followed the fortunes of the wretched king, in an ob&s;cure convent in Wales, and the mercile&s;s victors re&s;olved to glut their revenge, in adding in&s;ult to cruelty. The queen had not patience to wait the formality of a tri|al; but ordered him immediately to be led forth before the in&s;ulting populace, and &s;eemed to take a &s;avage plea&s;ure in fea&s;ting her eyes with his di&s;tre&s;&s;es. The gibbet erected for his execution was fifty feet high; his head was &s;ent to London, where the citizens received it in brutal triumph, and fixed it on the bridge. Several other lords al&s;o &s;hared his fate; all de|&s;erving pity indeed, had they not them&s;elves formerly ju&s;tified the pre&s;ent inhumanity, by &s;etting a cruel example.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="75">In the mean time the king, who hoped to find refuge in Wales, was quickly di&s;covered, and clo&s;ely pur&s;ued by his triumphant enemies. Finding no hopes of &s;uccour in that part of the country, he took &s;hipping for Ireland; but even there his wretched fortune &s;eemed willing to per&s;ecute him; he was driven back by con|trary winds, and delivered up to his adver|&s;aries, who expre&s;&s;ed their &s;atisfaction in the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of their treatment. He was conduct|ed to the capital, amid&s;t the in&s;ults and re|proaches of the people, and confined in the Tower. A charge was &s;oon after exhibited again&s;t him; in which no other crimes but his incapacity to govern, his indolence, his love of plea&s;ure, and his being &s;wayed by evil coun|&s;ellors, were objected again&s;t him. His depo|&s;ition was quickly voted by parliament; he was a&s;&s;igned a pen&s;ion for his &s;upport, his &s;on Edward, a youth of fourteen, was fixed upon to &s;ucceed him, and the queen was appointed re|gent during the minority.</P>
<P>The depo&s;ed monarch but a &s;hort time &s;ur|vived his misfortunes; he was &s;ent from pri&s;on to pri&s;on, a wretched outca&s;t,<MILESTONE N="1327" UNIT="A.D."> and the &s;port of his inhuman keepers. He had been at fir&s;t con&s;igned to the cu&s;tody of the earl of Lan|ca&s;ter; but this nobleman, &s;hewing &s;ome marks
<PB N="74" REF="76">
of re&s;pect and pity, he was taken out of his hands, and delivered over to lord Berkeley, Montravers, and Gournay, who were entru&s;t|ed with the charge of guarding him month about. Whatever his treatment from lord Berkeley might have been, the other two &s;eem|ed re&s;olved, that he &s;hould enjoy none of the comforts of life, while in their cu&s;tody. They practi&s;ed every kind of indignity upon him, as if their de&s;ign had been to accelerate his death by the bitterne&s;s of his &s;ufferings. Among other acts of brutal oppre&s;&s;ion, it is &s;aid, that they &s;haved him for &s;port in the open fields, u&s;ing water from a neighbouring ditch. The genius of the people mu&s;t have been greatly deba&s;ed, or they would never have per|mitted &s;uch indecencies to be practi&s;ed on a monarch, who&s;e greate&s;t fault was the violence of his friend&s;hips. He is &s;aid to have borne his former indignities with patience, but all for|titude for&s;ook him upon this occa&s;ion; he looked upon his mercile&s;s in&s;ulters with an air of fal|len maje&s;ty, and bur&s;ting into tears, exclaim|ed, that the time might come, when he would be more decently attended. This, however, was but a vain expectation. As his per&s;ecu|tors &s;aw that his death might not arrive, even under every cruelty, till a revolution had
<PB N="75" REF="77">
been made in his favour, they re&s;olved to rid them&s;elves of their fears, by de&s;troying him at once. Accordingly, his two keepers, Gour|nay and Montravers, came to Berkley ca&s;tle, where Edward was then confined; and having concerted a method of putting him to death without any external &s;igns of violence, they threw him on a bed, holding him down by a table, which they placed over him. They then ran an horn pipe up his body, through which they conveyed a red hot iron; and thus burnt his bowels, without disfiguring his body. By this cruel artifice, they expected to have their crime concealed; but his horrid &s;hrieks, which were heard at a di&s;tance from the ca&s;tle, &s;oon gave a &s;u&s;picion of the mur|der; and the whole was &s;oon after divulged, by the confe&s;&s;ion of one of the accomplices. Misfortunes like his, mu&s;t ever create pity; and a puni&s;hment &s;o di&s;proportionate to the &s;uf|ferer's guilt, mu&s;t wipe away even many of tho&s;e faults, of which Edward was ju&s;tly culpale. He left behind him four children; two &s;ons, and two daughters: Edward was his elde&s;t &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or; John, died young; Jane was afterwards married to David Bruce king of Scotland; and Eleanor was married to Regi|nald, count of Gueldres.</P>

</FIGURE>CHAP. XIV. EDWARD III.</HEAD>
<P>THE parliament, by which young Ed|ward was rai&s;ed to the throne, during the life of his father, appointed twelve per&s;ons as his privy-council, to direct the operations of government. Mortimer, the queen's par|amour, who might naturally be &s;et down as one of the members, artfully excluded him|&s;elf, under a pretended &s;hew of moderation;
<PB N="77" REF="79">
but at the &s;ame time he &s;ecretly influenced all the mea&s;ures that came beneath their deliberation. He cau&s;ed the greate&s;t part of the royal reve|nues to be &s;ettled on the queen dowager, and he &s;eldom took the trouble to con&s;ult the mini&s;|ters of government in any public undertaking. The king him&s;elf was &s;o be&s;ieged by the favour|ite's creatures, that no acce&s;s could be procured to him, and the whole &s;overeign authority was &s;hared between Mortimer and the queen, who took no care to conceal her criminal attachment.</P>
<P>A government &s;o con&s;tituted, could not be of long continuance; and the &s;lighte&s;t &s;hock was &s;ufficient to overturn that power, which was founded neither in &s;trength nor virtue. An irruption of the Scotch gave the fir&s;t blow to Mortimer's credit; and young Ed|ward's own abilities contributed to its ruin. The Scotch, who had no connexion with either party, were re&s;olved to take advantage of the feeble &s;tate of the nation; and, without re|garding the truce that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the two kingdoms, attempted to &s;urpri&s;e the ca&s;tle of Norham. This commencement of ho&s;tilities, they &s;oon after &s;econded by a formidable inva&s;ion on the northern counties, with an army of twenty thou&s;and men. Edward, even at this early age, di&s;covered that martial di&s;po&s;ition,
<PB N="78" REF="80">
for which he was afterwards &s;o famous. He re&s;olved to intercept them in their retreat; and began his march in the middle of July,<MILESTONE N="1327" UNIT="A.D."> at the head of an army of three&s;core thou&s;and men; but after undergoing incredible fatigues, in pur&s;uing them through woods and mora&s;&s;es, he was unable to perceive any &s;igns of an enemy, except from the ravages they had made, and the &s;moaking ruins of villages, which they had &s;et on fire. In this di&s;appointment, he had no other re&s;ource, but to offer a reward to any who &s;hould di&s;cover the place where the Scots were po&s;ted. This the enemy under&s;tanding, &s;ent him word that they were ready to meet him, and give him battle. However, they had taken &s;o advantageous a &s;ituation, on the op|po&s;ite banks of the river Ware, that the king found it impracticable to attack them; and no threats could bring them to a battle upon equal terms.</P>
<P>It was in this &s;ituation, that the fir&s;t breach was di&s;covered between the king and Morti|mer, the queen's favourite. The young mon|arch, all ardour to engage, re&s;olved that night, at all hazards, not to allow the rava|gers to e&s;cape with impunity; but Mor|timer oppo&s;ed his influence to the valour of the king, and prevented an engagement,
<PB N="79" REF="81">
which might be attended with the mo&s;t de&s;|tructive con&s;equences to his authority, whether he won, or lo&s;t the day. Shortly after, the Scotch, under the command of Douglas, made an irruption into the Engli&s;h camp by night, and arrived at the very tent in which the king was &s;leeping. But the young monarch happening to wake in the critical moment, made a valiant defence again&s;t the enemy; his chamberlain and chaplain died fighting by his &s;ide; and he thus had time given him to e&s;cape in the dark. The Scotch being fru&s;trated in their de&s;ign upon the king, were contented to decamp for their own country, leaving their tents &s;tanding, without any per&s;on behind them, except &s;ix Engli&s;h pri&s;oners, who&s;e legs they had broken, to prevent their carrying intelligence to their countrymen. The e&s;cape of the Scotch was as di&s;agreeable a circum&s;tance to the Eng|li&s;h army, as the valour of the young king was applauded and admired. The failure on one part was entirely a&s;cribed to the queen's favou|rite; and the &s;ucce&s;s on the other, to the king's own intrepidity. The people began to wi&s;h for a removal of that authority, which &s;tood be|tween them and the monarch; and &s;pared no pains to aggravate their faults of the gover|nors, or to extol the ri&s;ing merit of their young &s;overeign.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="82">Mortimer now &s;aw him&s;elf exalted to a very precarious &s;ituation; and was re&s;olved, on any terms, to procure a peace with Scotland, in or|der to fix his power more firmly at home. A treaty was accordingly concluded between the two nations, in which the Engli&s;h renounced all title to &s;overeignty over the &s;i&s;ter kingdom; and the Scotch, in return, agreed to pay thirty thou&s;and marks as a compen&s;ation. The next &s;tep that Mortimer thought nece&s;&s;ary for his &s;ecurity, was to &s;eize the earl of Kent, brother to the late king, an harmle&s;s and well meaning per&s;on, who, under a per&s;ua&s;ion that his brother was &s;till alive, and concealed in &s;ome &s;ecret pri&s;on, entered into a de&s;ign of re&s;toring him to liberty, and rein&s;tating him in his former power. Him therefore, Mortimer re&s;olved to de&s;troy; and &s;ummoning him before parliament, had him accu&s;ed, condemned, and executed, even before the young king had time to interpo&s;e in his favour. In proportion as Mortimer thus got rid of his enemies, he was careful to enrich him&s;elf with their &s;poils. The e&s;tate of the unfortunate earl was &s;eized upon for the u&s;e of the favourite's younge&s;t &s;on; the immen&s;e fortunes of the Spen&s;ers were in like manner converted to his u&s;e. Thus his power became invidious, and his corrupt mo|rals made it &s;till more formidable.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="83">It was in this po&s;ture of affairs, that Edward re&s;olved to &s;hake off an authority that was odious to the nation, and particularly re&s;trictive upon him. But &s;uch was the power of the favourite, that it required as much precaution to overturn the u&s;urper, as to e&s;tabli&s;h the throne. The queen and Mortimer had for &s;ome time cho&s;en the ca&s;tle of Nottingham for the place of their re&s;idence; it was &s;trictly guarded, the gates locked every evening, and the keys carried to the queen. It was, there|fore, agreed between the king, and &s;ome of his barons, who &s;ecretly entered into his de&s;igns, to &s;eize upon them in this fortre&s;s; and for that purpo&s;e, Sir William Eland, the governor, was induced to admit them by a &s;ecret &s;ubterra|neous pa&s;&s;age, which had been formerly contrived for an outlet, but was now hidden with rubbi&s;h, and known only to one or two. It was by this, therefore, the noblemen in the king's intere&s;ts entered the ca&s;tle in the night; and Mortimer, without having it in his power to make any re&s;i&s;tance, was &s;eized in an apartment adjoin|ing that of the queen's. It was in vain that &s;he endeavoured to protect him; in vain &s;he entreated them to &s;pare her <Q REND="inline">"gentle Mortim|er;"</Q> the barons, deaf to her entreaties, denied her that pity, which &s;he had &s;o often refu&s;ed to
<PB N="82" REF="84">
others. Her paramour was condemned by the parliament, which was then &s;itting, without being permitted to make his defence, or even examining a witne&s;s again&s;t him. He was hanged on a gibbet at a place called Elmes, about a mile from London, where his body was left hanging for two days after. A &s;imilar &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t &s;ome of his adherents, particularly Gournay, and Montravers, the murderers of the late king; but the&s;e had time to elude puni&s;hment, by e&s;caping to the con|tinent. The queen, who was certainly the mo&s;t culpable, was &s;hielded by the dignity of her &s;ituation; &s;he was only di&s;carded from all &s;hare of power, and confined for life, to the ca&s;tle of Ri&s;ings, with a pen&s;ion of three thou|&s;and pounds a year. From this confinement, &s;he was never after &s;et free; and though the king annually paid her a vi&s;it of decent cere|mony, yet &s;he found her&s;elf abandoned to uni|ver&s;al contempt and dete&s;tation; and continued for above twenty five years after, a mi&s;erable monument of bla&s;ted ambition.</P>
<P>Edward being thus freed from the control of u&s;urped authority, re&s;olved to become po|pular, by an expedient which &s;eldom failed to gain the affections of the Engli&s;h. He knew that a conquering monarch was the fitte&s;t
<PB N="83" REF="85">
to plea&s;e a warlike people. The weakne&s;s of the Scotti&s;h government, which was at that time under a minority, gave him a favour|able opportunity of renewing ho&s;tilities; and the turbulent &s;pirit of the nobles of that country &s;till more contributed to promote his aims. A new pretender al&s;o &s;tarted up to that throne, namely, Edward Baliol, who&s;e father John had been crowned king of Scotland, and Edward re&s;olved to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his preten|&s;ions. He therefore gave him permi&s;&s;ion to levy what forces he was able in England; and with not above three thou&s;and adventu|rers, thus fortuitou&s;ly united, Baliol gained a con&s;iderable victory over his countrymen, in which twelve thou&s;and of their men were &s;lain. This victory, which was followed by &s;ome others, &s;o intimidated the Scotch, that their armies di&s;per&s;ed, and the kingdom &s;eem|ed as if &s;ubdued by an handful of men. Ba|liol, by one of tho&s;e unexpected turns of for|tune, common enough in barbarous times, was crowned king at Scone; and every noble|man, who was mo&s;t expo&s;ed to danger, &s;ub|mitted to his authority. But he did not long enjoy his &s;uperiority; by another turn equally &s;udden, he was attacked and defeated by Sir Archibald Douglas, and obliged to take re|fuge
<PB N="84" REF="86">
in England once more, in a mi&s;erable condition.</P>
<P>An attempt thus un&s;ucce&s;sfully made by Baliol, only &s;erved to enflame the ardour of Edward, who very joyfully accepted of that offer of homage and &s;uperiority, which it was Baliol's pre&s;ent intere&s;t to make. He there|fore prepared, with all his force, to rein&s;tate the depo&s;ed king of Scotland, in a govern|ment which would ever after be &s;ubordinate to his own. He accordingly prevailed upon his parliament to give him a &s;upply, which they reluctantly did; and, with a well-di&s;ci|plined army, he laid &s;iege to Berwick, which capitulated after a vigorous defence. It was in attempting to relieve this city, that a gene|ral engagement en&s;ued between the Scotch and the Engli&s;h. It was fought at Halli|down hill, a little north of Berwick, with great ob&s;tinacy on both &s;ides; but the fortune of Edward prevailed. Douglas, the Scotti&s;h general, was &s;lain, and &s;oon after the whole army put to the route. This victory was, in a great mea&s;ure, obtained by the expertne&s;s of the Engli&s;h archers, who now began to be fa|mous over Europe for their peculiar &s;kill. All the Scotti&s;h nobles of chief di&s;tinction were either &s;lain, or taken pri&s;oners; near thirty
<PB N="85" REF="87">
thou&s;and of their men fell in the action,<MILESTONE N="1333. July 9." UNIT="A.D."> while the lo&s;s of the Engli&s;h only amounted to about fifteen men; an inequality almo&s;t incredible. This important victory decided the fate of Scotland; Baliol, with very little trouble, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the country; and Edward returned in triumph to England, having pre|viou&s;ly &s;ecured many of the principal towns of Scotland, which were declared to be annexed to the Engli&s;h monarchy. The&s;e victories, however, were rather &s;plendid than &s;ervice|able; the Scotch &s;eeemed about this time, to have conceived an un&s;urmountable aver&s;ion to the Engli&s;h government; and no &s;ooner were Edward's forces withdrawn, than they revolted again&s;t Baliol, and well nigh expelled him the kingdom. Edward's appearance a &s;econd time &s;erved to bring them to &s;ubjec|tion; but they quickly renewed their animo|&s;ities upon his retiring. It was in vain, there|fore, that he employed all the arts of per&s;ua|&s;ion, and all the terrors of war, to induce them to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; they per&s;evered in their reluc|tance to obey; and they were daily kept in hopes, by promi&s;es of &s;uccour from France.</P>
<P>This kingdom, which had for a long time di&s;continued its animo&s;ities again&s;t England, began to be an object of Edward's jea|lou&s;y
<PB N="86" REF="88">
and ambition. A new &s;cene began to be opened in France, which operated for more than a century, in &s;ubjecting that country to all the mi&s;eries of war, till Europe at la&s;t be|gan to doubt, whether it was annexed to Eng|land by right of arms, or of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. France, at that period, was neither the exten&s;ive, nor the powerful kingdom we &s;ee it at this day. Many great provinces have been added to it &s;ince that period, particularly Dauphiny, Pro|vence, and Franche Comte; and the govern|ment was &s;till more feeble, by tho&s;e neigh|bouring princes, who were pretended &s;ubjects to the king, but, in reality, formidable rivals of his power. At the time we are &s;peaking of, that kingdom was particularly unfortu|nate; and the king &s;hared in the general ca|lamity. The three &s;ons of Philip the Fair, in full parliament, accu&s;ed their wives of adul|tery; and, in con&s;equence of this accu&s;ation, they were condemned and impri&s;oned for life. Lewis Hutin, the &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the crown of France, cau&s;ed his wife to be &s;trangled, and her lovers to be flead alive. After his death, as he left only a daughter, his next brother, Philip the Tall, a&s;&s;umed the crown, in preju|dice of the daughter; and vindicated his title by the Salic law, which laid it down, that no
<PB N="87" REF="89">
female &s;hould &s;ucceed to the crown. This law, however, was not univer&s;ally acknow|leged, nor &s;ufficiently confirmed by prece|dents, to procure an ea&s;y &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. They had hitherto enquired but &s;lightly in France, whether a female could &s;ucceed to the king|dom; and as laws are only made to regulate what may happen by what has happened al|ready, there were no facts upon which to ground the opinions on either &s;ide of the que&s;|tion. There were, in reality, precedents to countenance both claims, and thus to keep mankind in &s;u&s;pen&s;e. The parliament of France had often adjudged the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to women, as Artois was formerly given to a female, in pre|judice of the male heir. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Champagne had been, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, given to the daughters; while, on others, they were judged unqualified to &s;ucceed. We thus &s;ee that right changed with power; and ju&s;tice, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, was unknown, or di&s;regarded. In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, the younger brother of the late king, Charles the Fair, jealous of his elder brother's fortune, oppo&s;ed his pre|ten&s;ions, and a&s;&s;erted, that the late king's daughter was rightful heir to his crown. The cau&s;e, thus warmly conte&s;ted between the two brothers, was at la&s;t carried before the parlia|ment
<PB N="88" REF="90">
of France; and they decided, upon the Salic law, in favour of Philip the Elder. This monarch enjoyed the crown but a &s;hort time; and dying, left only daughters to &s;uc|ceed him. Charles, therefore, without a male opponent, &s;eized the crown, and enjoyed it for &s;ome time; but he al&s;o dying, left his wife pregnant. As there was now no appa|rent heir, the regency was conte&s;ted by two per&s;ons, who laid their claims upon this occa|&s;ion. Edward the third urged his preten&s;ions, as being by his mother I&s;abella, who was daughter to Philip the Fair, and &s;i&s;ter to the three la&s;t kings of France, rightful heir to the crown. Philip Valois, on the other hand, put him&s;elf in actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the government, as be|ing next heir by the male &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. He was, therefore, con&s;tituted regent of France; and the queen-dowager being unfortunately, &s;ome time after, brought to bed of a daughter, he was unanimou&s;ly elected king. He was crown|ed amid&s;t the univer&s;al congratulations of his &s;ubjects; received the appellation of Philip the Fortunate; and to this he added tho&s;e qua|lities which might merit good fortune, namely, ju&s;tice and virtue. Among other in&s;tances of his felicity, he might reckon that of the ho|mage paid him by Edward, his rival, which
<PB N="89" REF="91">
he came to offer at Amiens. However, as &s;trength generally in&s;pires ambition, this ho|mage was &s;oon followed by a war; and Ed|ward di&s;puted that crown, of which he had ju&s;t before declared him&s;elf a va&s;&s;al.</P>
<P>A brewer of Ghent was one of tho&s;e who gave the greate&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance to Edward in this war, and determined him to a&s;&s;ume the title of king of France. This citizen's name was James Ardevelt, a man grown too powerful for a &s;ubject; and one of tho&s;e who, according to Machiavel, kings ought to flatter, or de&s;troy. This citizen had, for &s;ome time, governed his countrymen with a more ab&s;olute &s;way than had ever been a&s;&s;umed by any of their lawful &s;overeigns. He placed and di&s;placed magi|&s;trates at his plea&s;ure. He was accompanied by a guard, who, on the lea&s;t &s;ignal from him, in&s;tantly a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated any man who had the mis|fortune to fall under his di&s;plea&s;ure. With the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of this man, therefore, Edward re&s;olved to undertake the conque&s;t of France. He fir&s;t, however, in a formal manner, con|&s;ulted his parliament on the propriety of the undertaking, obtained their approbation, re|ceived a proper &s;upply of wool, which he in|tended to barter with the Flemings; and be|ing attended with a body of Engli&s;h forces,
<PB N="90" REF="92">
and &s;everal of his nobility, he &s;ailed over into Flanders, big with his intended conque&s;ts.</P>
<P>Edward's fir&s;t &s;tep was to a&s;&s;ert his claim to the French crown; to a&s;&s;ume the title of king of the country, and brand Philip, his rival, with the title of U&s;urper.<MILESTONE N="1339" UNIT="A.D."> Philip, on the other hand, made vigorous preparations to oppo&s;e him; he even challenged the invader to try their fortune in &s;ingle combat, upon equal terms, in &s;ome appointed plain. Edward ac|cepted the challenge; for in every action this prince affected the hero; but &s;ome ob&s;tacles intervening, the war was pro&s;ecuted in the u&s;ual manner, both &s;ides taking every advantage when it happened to offer.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t great advantage gained by the Engli&s;h was in a naval engagement on the coa&s;t of Flanders, in which the French lo&s;t two hundred and thirty &s;hips, and had thirty thou&s;and of their &s;eamen, and two of their ad|mirals &s;lain. None of Philip's courtiers, it is &s;aid, dared to inform him of the event, till his je&s;ter gave him a hint, by which he di&s;co|vered the lo&s;s he had &s;u&s;tained. This victory, together with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;sful operations that &s;oon after followed, brought on a truce, which neither &s;ide &s;eemed willing to break, till the ambition of Edward was once more excited
<PB N="91" REF="93">
by the invitation of the count de Mountfort, who had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the province of Brittany, and applied to Edward to &s;econd his claims. An offer of this kind entirely coin|cided with Edward's mo&s;t &s;anguine de&s;ires. He immediately &s;aw the advantages ari&s;ing from &s;uch a propo&s;al. He was happy in the promi&s;ed a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mountfort, an active and valiant prince, clo&s;ely united to him by intere&s;t, and thus opening to him an entrance into the heart of France. On the other hand, he could have no hopes from the &s;ide of Flanders, as he was ob&s;tructed by tho&s;e nu|merous fortifications which had been rai&s;ed on that frontier. The&s;e flattering pro&s;pects, however, were for a while damped by the impri&s;onment of Mountfort, who&s;e aims be|ing di&s;covered, he found him&s;elf be&s;ieged in the city of Nantz, and taken. But Jane of Flanders, his wife, &s;oon made up for the lo&s;s of her hu&s;band. This lady, who was one of the mo&s;t extraordinary women of her age, courageou&s;ly undertook to &s;upport the falling fortunes of her family. She a&s;&s;embled the inhabitants of Rennes, where &s;he then re&s;ided; and carrying her infant &s;on in her arms, de|plored her misfortunes, and attempted to in|&s;pire the citizens with an affection for her cau&s;e. The inhabitants of Nantz in&s;tantly e&s;pou&s;ed
<PB N="92" REF="94">
her intere&s;ts, and all the other fortre&s;&s;es of Brittany embraced the &s;ame re&s;olution; the king of England was apprized of her efforts in his favour, and entreated to &s;end her &s;uc|cours with all po&s;&s;ible expedition to the town of Hennebone, in which place &s;he re&s;olved to &s;u&s;tain the attacks of the enemy. She was not deceived in her opinion of the enemies vigilance and activity. Charles de Blois, Phi|lip's general, anxious to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of &s;o important a fortre&s;s as Hennebone, and &s;till more to take the counte&s;s a pri&s;oner, &s;at down before the place with a large army, and conducted the &s;iege with indefatigable indu&s;|try. The defence was no le&s;s vigorous; &s;eve|ral &s;allies were made by the garri&s;on, in which the counte&s;s her&s;elf was &s;till the mo&s;t active, and led on to the a&s;&s;ault. Ob&s;erving one day that their whole army had quitted the camp to join in a general &s;torm, &s;he &s;allied out by a po&s;tern at the head of three hundred hor&s;e, &s;et fire to the enemies tents and baggage, put their &s;utlers and &s;ervants to the &s;word, and occa|&s;ioned &s;uch an alarm, that the French de&s;i&s;ted from the a&s;&s;ault, in order to cut off her com|munication with the town. Thus intercepted, &s;he retired to Auray, where &s;he continued five or &s;ix days; then returning at the head of five hundred hor&s;e, &s;he fought her way through
<PB N="93" REF="95">
one quarter of the French camp, and return|ed to her faithful citizens in triumph. But mere un&s;upported valour could not repel all the encroachments of an active and &s;u|perior enemy. The be&s;iegers had at length made &s;everal breaches in the walls; and it was apprehended that a general a&s;&s;ault, which was hourly expected, would be fatal. A capitu|lation was therefore propo&s;ed, and a conference was already begun, when the counte&s;s, who had mounted on a high tower, and was look|ing towards the &s;ea with great impatience, de|&s;cried &s;ome &s;hips at a di&s;tance. She immedi|ately exclaimed that &s;uccours were arrived, and forbid any further capitulation. She was not di&s;|appointed in her wi&s;hes; the fleet &s;he di&s;cerned carried a body of Engli&s;h gentlemen, with &s;ix thou&s;and archers, whom Edward had prepared for the relief of Hennebone, but who had been long detained by contrary winds. They entered the harbour, under the conduct of Sir Walter Manny, one of the mo&s;t valiant commanders of his time. This relief &s;erved to keep up the declining &s;pirits of the Bretons, until the time appointed by the late truce with Edward was expired, on which he was at liberty to re|new the war in greater form.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="96"><MILESTONE N="1342" UNIT="A.D."> He accordingly &s;oon after landed at Mor|bian, near Vannes, with an army of twelve thou&s;and men; and being ma&s;ter of the field, where no enemy dared to appear again&s;t him, he endeavoured to give lu&s;tre to his arms, by be&s;ieging &s;ome of the mo&s;t capital of the ene|mies fortifications. The vigour of his operations led on to another truce, and this was &s;oon af|ter followed by a fre&s;h infraction. The truth is, neither &s;ide ob&s;erved a truce longer than it coincided with their intere&s;ts; and both had always &s;ufficient art to throw the blame of per|fidy from them&s;elves. The earl of Derby was &s;ent by Edward to defend the province of Guienne, with in&s;tructions al&s;o to take every po&s;&s;ible advantage that circum&s;tances might offer. At fir&s;t, therefore, his &s;ucce&s;&s;es were ra|pid and brilliant; but as &s;oon as the French king had time to prepare, he met with a very unexpected re&s;i&s;tance; &s;o that the Engli&s;h general was compelled to &s;tand upon the de|fen&s;ive. One fortre&s;s after another was &s;ur|rendered to the French; and nothing appeared but a total extinction of the power of England upon the continent. In this &s;ituation, Edward re&s;olved to bring relief in per&s;on to his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ubjects and allies; and accordingly embarked at Southampton,<MILESTONE N="1346" UNIT="A.D."> on board a fleet of near a
<PB N="95" REF="97">
thou&s;and &s;ail, of all dimen&s;ions. He carried with him, be&s;ides all the chief nobility of Eng|land, his elde&s;t &s;on, the prince of Wales (after|wards &s;urnamed the black prince) a youth of about fifteen years old, and already remarkable both for under&s;tanding and valour above his age. His army con&s;i&s;ted of four thou&s;and men at arms; ten thou&s;and archers, ten thou&s;and Wel&s;h in|fantry, and &s;ix thou&s;and Iri&s;h, all which he landed &s;afely at La Hogue, a port it Norman|dy, which country he determined to make the &s;eat of the war.</P>
<P>The intelligence of Edward's landing, and the deva&s;tation cau&s;ed by his troops, who di&s;|per&s;ed them&s;elves over the whole face of the country, &s;oon &s;pread univer&s;al con&s;ternation through the French court. The rich city of Caen was taken and plundered by the Engli&s;h, without mercy; the villages and towns, even up to Paris, &s;hared the &s;ame fate; and the French had no other re&s;ource but by breaking down their bridges, to attempt putting a &s;top to the invader's career. In the mean time, Philip was not idle in making preparations to repre&s;s the enemy. He had &s;tationed one of his generals, Godemar de Faye, with an army on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river Somme, over which Edward was to pa&s;s; while he him&s;elf, at the
<PB N="96" REF="98">
head of an hundred thou&s;and fighting men, ad|vanced to give the Engli&s;h battle. Edward thus, in the mid&s;t of his victories, unexpect|edly expo&s;ed to the danger of being enclo|&s;ed and &s;tarving in an enemy's country, pub|li&s;hed a reward to any that &s;hould bring him intelligence of a pa&s;&s;age over the river Som|me. This was di&s;covered by a pea&s;ant of the country; and Edward had ju&s;t time to get his whole army over the river, when Philip appeared in his rear.</P>
<P>As both armies had for &s;ome time been in &s;ight of each other, nothing was &s;o eagerly ex|pected on each &s;ide as a battle; and although the forces were extremely di&s;proportioned, the Engli&s;h amounting only to thirty thou&s;and, the French to an hundred and twenty thou&s;and; yet Edward re&s;olved to indulge the impetuo&s;i|ty of his troops, and put all to the hazard of a battle. He accordingly cho&s;e his ground, with advantage, near the village of Crecy; and there determined to await with tranquility the &s;hock of the enemy. He drew up his men on a gen|tle a&s;cent, and divided them into three lines. The fir&s;t was commanded by the young prince of Wales; the &s;econd was conducted by the earls of Northampton and Arundel; and the third, which was kept as a body of re&s;erve,
<PB N="97" REF="99">
was headed by the king in per&s;on. As his &s;mall army was in danger of being &s;urrounded, he threw up trenches on his flank; and placed all his baggage in a wood behind him, which he al&s;o &s;ecured by an entrenchment. Having thus made the proper di&s;po&s;itions, he and the prince of Wales received the &s;acra|ment with great devotion; and all his beha|viour denoted the calm intrepidity of a man re&s;olved on conque&s;t, or death. He rode from rank to rank with a &s;erene countenance; bad his &s;oldiers remember the honour of their coun|try; and by his eloquence animated the whole army to a degree of enthu&s;ia&s;tic expectation. It is &s;aid al&s;o by &s;ome that he fir&s;t made u&s;e of artillery upon this occa&s;ion; and placed in his front &s;ome pieces, which contributed not a lit|tle to throw the enemy into di&s;order.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide, Philip, impelled by re|&s;entment, and confident of his numbers, was more &s;olicitous in bringing the enemy to an engagement, than prudent in taking mea&s;ures for the &s;ucce&s;s of it. He was advi&s;ed by &s;ome of his generals to defer the combat till the en|&s;uing day, when his army would have recovered from their fatigue, and might be di&s;po&s;ed into better order, than their pre&s;ent hurry permitted them to ob&s;erve. But it was now too late; the
<PB N="98" REF="100">
impatience of his troops was too great to be re&s;trained; they pre&s;&s;ed one upon the other, and no orders could curb their blind impetuo|&s;ity. They were led on, however, in three bodies to oppo&s;e tho&s;e of the Engli&s;h. The fir&s;t line, con&s;i&s;ting of fifteen thou&s;and Genoe&s;e cro&s;s-bow-men, were commanded by Anthony Doria. The &s;econd body was led by the count Alen&ccedil;on, brother to the king, and the king him&s;elf was at the head of the third.</P>
<P>About three in the afternoon, the famous battle of Crecy began, by the French king's ordering the Genoe&s;e archers to charge; but they were &s;o fatigued with their march, that they cried out for a little re&s;t before they &s;hould engage. The count Alen&ccedil;on, being informed of their petition, rode up and reviled them as cowards, commanding them to begin the on&s;et without delay. Their reluctance to begin, was &s;till more encrea&s;ed by an heavy &s;hower which fell that in&s;tant and relaxed their bow &s;trings; &s;o that the di&s;charge they made, produced but very little effect. On the other hand, the Eng|li&s;h archers, who had kept their bows in ca&s;es, and were favoured by a &s;udden gleam of &s;un|&s;hine, that rather dazzled the enemy, let fly their arrows &s;o thick, and with &s;uch good aim, that nothing was to be &s;een among the
<PB N="99" REF="101">
Genoe&s;e but hurry, terror, and di&s;may. The young prince of Wales had pre&s;ence of mind to take advantage of their confu&s;ion, and to lead on his line to the charge. The French cavalry, however, commanded by count Alen|&ccedil;on, wheeling round &s;u&s;tained the combat, and began to hem the Engli&s;h round. The earls of Arundel and Northampton, now came in to a&s;&s;i&s;t the prince, who appeared foremo&s;t in the very &s;hock; and wherever he appeared, turn|ing the fortune of the day. The thicke&s;t of the battle was now gathered round him, and the valour of a boy filled even veterans with a&s;toni&s;hment; but their &s;urprize at his courage could not give way to their fears for his &s;afety. Being apprehen&s;ive that &s;ome mi&s;|chance might happen to him in the end, an officer was di&s;patched to the king, de&s;iring that &s;uccours might be &s;ent to the prince's relief. Edward, who had all this time, with great tranquility, viewed the engagement, from a wind-mill, demanded with &s;eeming deliberation if his &s;on were dead; but being an&s;wered that he &s;till lived, and was giving a&s;toni&s;hing in|&s;tances of valour; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"then tell my generals, cried the king, that he &s;hall have no a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance from me; the honour of this day &s;hall be his, let him &s;hew him&s;elf worthy the pro|fe&s;&s;ion
<PB N="100" REF="102">
of arms, and let him be indebted to his own merit alone for victory."</Q> This &s;peech, being reported to the prince and his at|tendants, it in&s;pired them with new courage; they made a fre&s;h attack upon the French ca|valry, and count Alen&ccedil;on, their brave&s;t com|mander, was &s;lain. This was the beginning of their total overthrow: the French being now without a competent leader, were thrown into confu&s;ion; the Wel&s;h infantry ru&s;hed into the mid&s;t of the conflict, and di&s;patched tho&s;e with their long knives who had &s;urvived the fury of the former on&s;et. It was in vain that the king of France him&s;elf, &s;eemed almo&s;t &s;ingly to main|tain the combat; he endeavoured to animate his few followers, both by his voice and ex|ample, but the victory was too deci&s;ive to be re&s;i&s;ted; while he was yet endeavouring to face the enemy, John de Hainault &s;eized the reins of his hor&s;e, and, turning him round, carried him off the field of battle. In this en|gagement, thirty thou&s;and of the French were killed upon the field; and, among this number, were John king of Bohemia, James king of Majorca, Ralph duke of Lorrain, nine counts, four and twenty bannerets, twelve hun|dred knights, fifteen hundred gentlemen, and four thou&s;and men at arms. There is &s;ome|thing
<PB N="101" REF="103">
remarkable in the fate of the Bohemian monarch; who, though blind, was yet willing to &s;hare in the engagement. This unfortunate prince, enquiring the fate of the day, was told that all was lo&s;t, and his &s;on Charles obliged to retire de&s;perately wounded; and that the prince of Wales bore down every thing before him. Having received this information, blind as he was, he commanded his knights to lead him into the hotte&s;t part of the bat|tle again&s;t the young warrior; accordingly, four of them ru&s;hed with him into the thick|e&s;t part of the enemy, where they were all quickly &s;lain.</P>
<P>The whole French army took to flight, and were put to the &s;word by the pur&s;uers without mercy, till night &s;topped the carnage. The king, on his return to the camp, flew into the arms of the prince of Wales and exclaimed, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My valiant &s;on, continue as you have begun; you have acquitted your&s;elf nobly, and are worthy of the kingdom that will be your in|heritance."</Q> The next morning was foggy, and a party of the militia of Rouen coming to join the French army, were routed by the Engli&s;h at the fir&s;t on&s;et; many more al&s;o were decoyed by &s;ome French &s;tandards, which the victors placed upon the mountains, and to
<PB N="102" REF="104">
which the fugitives re&s;orted, where they were cut in pieces without mercy. Never was a victory more &s;ea&s;onable, or le&s;s bloody to the Engli&s;h than this. Notwith&s;tanding the great &s;laughter of the enemy, the conquerors lo&s;t but one e&s;quire, three knights, and a few of inferior rank. The cre&s;t of the king of Bohe|mia was three o&s;trich feathers, with this motto, Ich Dien; which &s;ignifies, in the German lan|guage, I &s;erve. This was thought to be a pro|per prize to perpetuate the victory; and it was accordingly added to the arms of the prince of Wales, and it has been adopted by all his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>But this victory was attended with &s;till more &s;ub&s;tantial advantages; for Edward, as mode|rate in conque&s;t, as prudent in his mea&s;ures to obtain it, re&s;olved to &s;ecure an ea&s;y entrance into France for the future. With this view he laid &s;iege to Calais, that was then defended by John de Vienne, an experienced command|er, and &s;upplied with every thing nece&s;&s;ary for defence. The king, however, knowing the diffi|culty of taking &s;o &s;trong a town by force, re|&s;olved to reduce it by famine. He cho&s;e a &s;ecure &s;tation for his camp; drew entrench|ments round the city, and made proper pro|vi&s;ions for his &s;oldiers to endure a winter cam|paign.
<PB N="103" REF="105">
The&s;e operations, though &s;low, were at length &s;ucce&s;sful. It was in vain that the governor made a noble defence, that he ex|cluded all the u&s;ele&s;s mouths from the city, which Edward generou&s;ly permitted to pa&s;s unmole&s;ted through his camp. It was at length taken, after a twelvemonth's &s;iege, the defen|dants having been reduced to the la&s;t extre|mity by famine and fatigue. The ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, made by the town&s;men, was not a little di&s;plea&s;ing to Edward; and he had often declared, that when put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place, he would take &s;ignal revenge for the numbers of men he had lo&s;t during the &s;iege. It was with great difficulty, therefore, that he was per&s;uaded to accept of their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and to &s;pare their lives, upon condition, that &s;ix of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable citizens &s;hould be &s;ent him, to be di&s;po&s;ed of as he &s;hould think proper; but on the&s;e he was re&s;olved to wreak his re&s;entment, and he gave orders that they &s;hould be led into his camp, bare-headed, and bare-footed, with ropes about their necks, in the manner of criminals ju&s;t preparing for in&s;tant execution. When the news of this fierce re&s;o|lution was brought into the city, it &s;pread new con&s;ternation among the inhabitants. Who &s;hould be the men, that were thus to be offer|ed
<PB N="104" REF="106">
up as victims to procure the &s;afety of all the re&s;t; and by their deaths appea&s;e the vic|tor's re&s;entment, was a fre&s;h &s;ubject of dread|ful enquiry. In this terrible &s;u&s;pen&s;e, one of the principal inhabitants, who&s;e name was Eu&s;tace de St. Pierre, walked forward, and of|fered him&s;elf as willing to undergo any tor|tures that could procure his fellow-citizens &s;afety. Five more &s;oon followed his noble ex|ample; and the&s;e marching out like criminals, laid the keys of their city at Edward's feet; but no &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions &s;eemed &s;ufficient to appea&s;e his re&s;entment; and they would in all proba|bility have &s;uffered death, had not the genero|&s;ity of their conduct affected the queen, who interceded in their behalf, and with &s;ome diffi|culty obtained their pardon.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1347" UNIT="A.D."> Edward having thus opened him&s;elf a pa&s;|&s;age into France, by which he might at any time pour in his forces, and withdraw them with &s;ecurity, re&s;olved on every method that could add &s;trength or &s;tability to his new ac|qui&s;ition. He ordered all the French inhabi|tants to leave the town, and peopled it with his own &s;ubjects from England. He al&s;o made it the &s;taple, or principal market for wool, leather, tin, and lead; which were the principal Engli&s;h commodities for which there was any con&s;ide|rable
<PB N="105" REF="107">
demand upon the continent. All the Engli&s;h were obliged to bring their goods thi|ther; and foreign merchants came to the &s;ame place to purcha&s;e them. By the&s;e means, the city became populous, rich, and flouri&s;hing; and although it had like to have been taken &s;ome time after by treachery, it continued for above two centuries after in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h, and braved all the military power of France.</P>
<P>The treachery, which had like to have re&s;to|red it to the French, aro&s;e from the perfidy of Aymer de Pavie, an Italian, who had been ap|pointed governor of the place. He agreed to deliver it up to the enemy, when his perfidy was di&s;covered by Edward, who obliged him to carry on the treaty, and to per&s;uade the ene|my that he was &s;till in their intere&s;ts. Accord|ingly a day was appointed for the admi&s;&s;ion of the French troops into the city; while the king, with a &s;trong body of forces, took care to pre|pare for their reception. All tho&s;e who en|tered the city were immediately cut to pieces; and the garri&s;on, with Edward, and Sir Wal|ter Manny at their head, ru&s;hing out in pur&s;uit of the re&s;t, a fierce and bloody engagement en|&s;ued, in which the king overthrew and took
<PB N="106" REF="108">
Eu&s;tace de Ribaumont, a man of remarkable &s;trength and valour, with his own hand.</P>
<P>In this manner, the war between the Engli&s;h and French was carried on with mutual animo|&s;ity, a war which at once thinned the inhabitants of the invaded country, while it drained that of the invaders. But a de&s;truction &s;till more terri|ble than that of war contributed, at this time, to de&s;olate the wretched provinces of Europe. A pe&s;tilence, more dreadful than any mention|ed in the annals of hi&s;tory, which had al|ready almo&s;t di&s;peopled A&s;ia and Africa, came to &s;ettle upon the we&s;tern world with encrea&s;ed malignity. It is &s;aid to have taken its origin in the great kingdom of Cathay, where it ro&s;e from the earth with the mo&s;t horrid and &s;ulphureous &s;tench, de&s;troying all the inhabitants, and even marking plants and minerals with its malig|nity. The fourth part of the people were cut off; and it particularly raged with &s;uch vio|lence in London, that in one year's &s;pace, there were buried in the Charter Hou&s;e church-yard, above fifty thou&s;and per&s;ons. It was in the mid&s;t of this terrible infliction from nature,<MILESTONE N="1349" UNIT="A.D."> that the ambition of Edward and Philip was exerted for new conque&s;ts, and was adding to the calamities of mankind. Yet &s;till the&s;e ra|vages
<PB N="107" REF="109">
were &s;ilently repairing by commerce and indu&s;try; the&s;e arts, which were then de&s;pi&s;ed by princes, were laying the &s;eeds of future opu|lence, and encrea&s;ed population. The arts of peace had for &s;ome time been revived in Italy, and were gradually travelling we&s;tward; the refinements and the plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e, every day began to improve, although intellectual refinements were as yet totally unknown. Sen|&s;ual enjoyments, mu&s;t ever be carried to &s;ome height before mankind can find lei&s;ure or ta&s;te for entertainments of a more exqui&s;ite nature.</P>
<P>Nor was England free from internal wars during this dreary period. While Edward was reaping victories upon the continent, the Scotch, ever willing to embrace a favourable opportunity of rapine and revenge, invaded the frontiers with a numerous army, headed by David Bruce their king. This unexpected in|va&s;ion, at &s;uch a juncture, alarmed the Engli&s;h, but was not capable of intimidating them. Lionel, Edward's &s;on, who was left guardian of England during his father's ab&s;ence, was yet too young to take upon him the command of an army; but the victories on the continent, &s;eemed to in&s;pire even women with valour: Philippa, Edward's queen, took upon her the
<PB N="108" REF="110">
conduct of the field, and prepared to repul&s;e the enemy in per&s;on.<MILESTONE N="1346" UNIT="A.D."> Accordingly, having made lord Percy general under her, &s;he met the Scots at a place called Nevill's Cro&s;s near Durham, and offered them battle. The Scotch king was no le&s;s impatient to engage; he imagined that he might obtain an ea&s;y vic|tory again&s;t undi&s;ciplined troops, and headed by a woman. But he was mi&s;erably deceived. His army was quickly routed and driven from the field. Fifteen thou&s;and of his men were cut to pieces; and he him&s;elf, with many of his nobles and knights, were taken pri&s;oners, and carried in triumph to London.</P>
<P>This victory diffu&s;ed an univer&s;al degree of joy through the nation; a captive king was an object that flattered their pride, and they &s;oon had new rea&s;ons for exultation. Philip, who was &s;urnamed the Fortunate, upon coming to the crown of France, ended his life under the accumulation of every misfortune that could render a king unhappy. John his &s;on &s;ucceeded him on the throne, which was but ill &s;upported by Philip, and yet &s;till wor&s;e by him. This weak, yet virtuous prince, up|on coming to the crown, found him&s;elf at the head of an exhau&s;ted nation, and a divided and factious nobility. France at that time, pretty
<PB N="109" REF="111">
much re&s;embled England under the reign of a prince of the &s;ame name &s;ome ages before. They had parliaments of barons de&s;potic over their own hereditary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and they ob|liged John their king, to &s;ign a charter very much re&s;embling the Magna Charta, which had formerly been &s;igned by his name-&s;ake of England. The warlike re&s;ources, therefore, of France and England, were at this time very unequal. John was at the head of a nobility, that acknowledged no &s;ubordination among each other; they led their dependent &s;laves to battle, and obeyed their &s;uperiors only as it &s;uited their inclination. Their king might more ju&s;tly be &s;aid to command a number of &s;mall armies under di&s;tinct leaders, than one va&s;t machine, operating with uniformity and united efforts. The French barons paid their own &s;oldiers, puni&s;hed their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and re|warded their fidelity. But the forces of Eng|land were under a very different e&s;tabli&s;hment; the main body of the Engli&s;h army was com|po&s;ed of &s;oldiers indi&s;criminately levied through|out the nation, paid by the king, and regard|ing him alone as the &s;ource of preferment or di&s;grace. In&s;tead of per&s;onal attendance, the nobility contributed &s;upplies in money; and there was only &s;uch a number of nobles in the
<PB N="110" REF="112">
army as might keep the &s;pirit of honour alive without injuring military &s;ubordination.</P>
<P>It was in this &s;tate of things, that a &s;hort truce which had been concluded between Ed|ward and Philip was di&s;&s;olved by the death of the latter; and Edward, well plea&s;ed with the factions that then prevailed in France, was re|&s;olved to &s;eize the opportunity of encrea&s;ing its di&s;tre&s;&s;es. Accordingly the Black Prince was &s;ent into France with his army, on board a fleet of an hundred &s;ail; and, landing in Ga&s;cony, carried his deva&s;tations into the heart of the country. On the other hand, Ed|ward him&s;elf made an irruption on the &s;ide of Calais, at the head of a numerous army, and ravaged all the open country. In the mean time John, who was as yet unprepared to op|po&s;e the progre&s;s of the enemy, continued a quiet &s;pectator of their in&s;ults; nor was it till the &s;ucceeding &s;ummer's campaign, that he re|&s;olved to attack the Black Prince,<MILESTONE N="1355" UNIT="A.D."> who&s;e army was by this time reduced to a body of about twelve thou&s;and men. With &s;uch a trifling complement of forces, had this young war|rior ventured to penetrate into the heart of France, with a de&s;ign of joining his forces to tho&s;e of the duke of Lanca&s;ter. But he &s;oon found that his &s;cheme was im|practicable,
<PB N="111" REF="113">
the country before him was too well guarded to prevent his advancing fur|ther; and all the bridges behind were broken down, which effectually barred a retreat. In this embarra&s;&s;ing &s;ituation, his perplexity was increa&s;ed, by being informed, that the king of France was actually marching at the head of &s;ixty thou&s;and men to intercept him. He at fir&s;t thought of retreating; but &s;oon finding it im|po&s;&s;ible, he determined calmly to await the approach of the enemy; and notwith&s;tanding the di&s;parity of forces, to commit all to the hazard of a battle.</P>
<P>It was at a place called Maupertuis, near Poictiers, that both armies came in &s;ight of each other. The French king might very ea&s;ily have &s;tarved the Engli&s;h into any terms he thought proper to impo&s;e: but &s;uch was the impatient valour of the French nobili|ty, and &s;uch their certainty of &s;ucce&s;s, that it might have been equally fatal to attempt re|pre&s;&s;ing their ardour to engage. In the mean time, while both armies were drawn out, and expecting the &s;ignal to begin, they were &s;top|ped by the appearance of the cardinal of Peri|gord, who attempted to be a meditator between them. However, John, who made him&s;elf &s;ure of victory, would li&s;ten to no other terms
<PB N="112" REF="114">
than the re&s;titution of Calais; with which the Black Prince refu&s;ing to comply, the on&s;et was deferred till the next morning, for which both &s;ides waited in anxious &s;u&s;pen&s;e.</P>
<P>It was during this interval, that the young prince &s;hewed him&s;elf worthy of conque&s;t; he &s;trengthened his po&s;t by new intrenchments; he placed three hundred men in ambu&s;h, with as many archers, who were commanded to at|tack the enemy in flank, during the heat of the engagement. Having taken the&s;e precau|tions, and the morning beginning to appear, he ranged his army in three divi&s;ions; the van commanded by the earl of Warwick; the rear by the earls of Sali&s;bury and Suffolk; and the main body by him&s;elf. In like man|ner, the king of France arranged his forces in three divi&s;ions; the fir&s;t commanded by the Duke of Orleans; the &s;econd by the Dau|phin, attended by his younger brothers; while he him&s;elf led up the main body, &s;econded by his younge&s;t and favourite &s;on, then about fourteen years of age. As the Engli&s;h were to be attacked only by marching up a long narrow lane, the French &s;uffered greatly from their archers, who were po&s;ted on each &s;ide, behind the hedges. Nor were they in a better &s;ituation upon emerging from this danger,
<PB N="113" REF="115">
being met by the black prince him&s;elf, at the head of a cho&s;en body of troops, who made a furious on&s;et upon their forces, already in great di&s;order. A dreadful overthrow en&s;ued; tho&s;e who were as yet in the lane recoiled upon their own forces; while the Engli&s;h troops, who had been placed in ambu&s;h, took that opportunity to encrea&s;e the confu&s;ion, and confirm the victory. The dauphin, and the duke of Orleans, were among the fir&s;t that fled. The king of France him&s;elf made the utmo&s;t efforts to retrieve by his valour, what his ra&s;hne&s;s had forfeited; but his &s;ingle courage was unable to &s;top that con&s;ternation, which had now become general through his army; and his cavalry &s;oon flying, he found him&s;elf totally expo&s;ed to the enemy's fury. He &s;aw his nobles falling round him, valiantly fighting in his defence, and his younge&s;t &s;on wounded by his &s;ide. At length, &s;pent with fatigue, and de&s;pairing of &s;ucce&s;s, he thought of yielding him&s;elf a pri&s;oner; and frequently cried out, that he was ready to de|liver him&s;elf to his cou&s;in, the prince of Wales. The honour of taking him, however, was re|&s;erved for a much more ignoble hand; he was &s;eized by Dennis de Morbec, a knight of Ar|ras, who had been obliged to fly his country for murder.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="116">This &s;ucce&s;s was, in a great mea&s;ure, ow|ing to the valour and conduct of the black prince; but his moderation in victory was a nobler triumph than had ever graced any for|mer conqueror. He came forth to meet the captive monarch with an air of pitying mo|de&s;ty; he remon&s;trated with him in the mo&s;t humble manner, when he began to complain of his misfortunes, that he &s;till had the com|fort left of reflecting, that, though un&s;ucce&s;s|ful, he had done all that de&s;erved to en&s;ure conque&s;t; he promi&s;ed, that a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive de|ference to his dignity &s;hould never be wanting to &s;often his captivity; and at table he ac|tually refu&s;ed to &s;it down, but &s;tood among the number of his pri&s;oner's attendants, declar|ing, that it did not become him, as a &s;ubject, to &s;it down in the pre&s;ence of a king.</P>

<P><PB N="115" REF="117">Two kings pri&s;oners in the &s;ame court, and at the &s;ame time, were con&s;idered as glorious atchievements; but all that England gained by them was only glory. Whatever was won in France, with all the dangers of war, and the expence of preparation, was &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and in a manner &s;ilently, lo&s;t, without the morti|fication of a defeat. It may be ea&s;ily &s;up|po&s;ed, that the treaties which were made with the captive kings, were highly advantageous to the conquerors; but the&s;e treaties were no longer ob&s;erved, than while the Engli&s;h had it in their power to enforce obedience. It is true, that John held to his engagements as far as he was able; but by being a pri&s;oner he lo&s;t his authority; and his misfortunes had ren|dered him contemptible at home. The dau|phin, and the &s;tates of France, rejected the treaties he had been induced to &s;ign; and pre|pared, in good earne&s;t, to repel the meditated inva&s;ions of the conqueror.

it was in vain that Edward alledged the obli|gation of the treaties which had been &s;igned at London, and plundered the country round to provoke an engagement.

It was &s;tipulated, that Edward &s;hould for ever renounce all claim to the kingdom of France; and &s;hould only remain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the terri|tories of Poictou, Xaintonge, l'Agenois, Pe|rigord, the Limou&s;in, Quercy, Rouvergne, l'Angoumois, and other di&s;tricts in that quar|ter, together with Calais, Gui&s;nes, Montreuil, and the county of Ponthieu, on the other &s;ide of France.

<P>Upon John's return to his dominions, he found him&s;elf very ill able to ratify tho&s;e terms of peace that had been ju&s;t concluded. He was without finances, at the head of an exhau&s;ted &s;tate; his &s;oldiers without di&s;cipline, and his pea&s;ants without &s;ubordination. The&s;e had ri&s;en in great numbers; and one of the

chiefs of their banditti a&s;&s;umed the title of the Friend of God, and the terror of Man. A citizen of Sens, named John Gouge, al&s;o got him&s;elf, by means of his robberies, to be acknowledged king; and he &s;oon cau&s;ed as many calamities by his deva&s;tations, as the real king had brought on by his misfortunes. Such was the &s;tate of that wretched kingdom, upon the return of its captive monarch; and yet, &s;uch was his ab&s;urdity, that he immedi|ately prepared for a cru&s;ade into the Holy Land, before he was well replaced on the throne. Had his exhau&s;ted &s;ubjects been able to equip him for this chimerical project, it is probable he would have gone through with it; but their mi&s;eries were &s;uch, that they were even too poor to pay his ran&s;om.

<P>Charles, &s;urnamed the Wi&s;e, &s;ucceeded his father on the throne of France; and this mo|narch, merely by the force of a finely con|ducted policy, and even though &s;uffering &s;ome defeats, re&s;tored his country once more to tran|quility and power. He quelled and di&s;&s;ipated a &s;et of banditti, who had a&s;&s;ociated them|&s;elves under the name of Companions, and who had long been a terror to the peaceable inhabitants. He had them enrolled into a body, and led them into the kingdom of Ca&s;|tile again&s;t Peter, &s;urnamed the Cruel, whom his &s;ubjects had dethroned; and who, by means of an alliance with the Engli&s;h, endeavoured to get him&s;elf rein&s;tated upon the throne. In con&s;equence of the&s;e alliances, the Engli&s;h and French again came to an engagement; their armies on the one &s;ide command|ed by the black prince; on the other, by Henry of Tran&s;tamarre, and Bertrand du Gue&s;|clin,
<PB N="119" REF="121">
one of the mo&s;t con&s;ummate generals, and accompli&s;hed characters of the age in which he lived. However, the u&s;ual good fortune of the Engli&s;h prince prevailed; <MILESTONE N="1367. April 3."

<P>Neverthele&s;s the&s;e victories, were attended with very few good effects. The Engli&s;h, by their frequent &s;upplies, had been quite exhau&s;t|ed, and were unable to continue an army in the field. Charles, on the other hand, cautiou&s;ly forbore coming to any deci&s;ive engagement; but was contented to let his enemies wa&s;te their &s;trength in attempts to plunder a forti|fied country. When they were retired, he then was &s;ure to &s;ally forth, and po&s;&s;e&s;s him|&s;elf of &s;uch places as they were not &s;trong enough to defend. He fir&s;t fell upon Pon|thieu; the citizens of Abbeville opened their gates to him; tho&s;e of St. Valois, Rue, and Crotoy, imitated the example; and the whole country was, in a little time, reduced to total &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The &s;outhern provinces were, in the &s;ame manner, invaded by his generals with equal &s;ucce&s;s; while the black prince, de&s;ti|tute of &s;upplies from England, and wa&s;ted by a cruel and con&s;umptive di&s;order, was obliged
<PB N="120" REF="122">
to return to his native country, leaving the af|fairs of the &s;outh of France in a mo&s;t de&s;pe|rate condition.</P>
<P>In this exigence, the re&s;entment of the king of England was excited to the utmo&s;t pitch; and he &s;eemed re&s;olved to take &s;ignal vengeance on his enemies of the continent. But the fortunate occa&s;ion &s;eemed now elap&s;|ed; and all his de&s;igns were marked with ill &s;ucce&s;s. The earl of Pembroke, and his whole army, were intercepted at &s;ea, and taken pri&s;oners by Henry, king of Ca&s;tile. This nobleman in per&s;on attempted to embark with an army for Bourdeaux; but was detained by contrary winds, and obliged to lay a&s;ide the expedition. Sir Robert Knolles, one of his generals on the continent, at the head of thirty thou&s;and men, was defeated by Bertrand du Gue&s;clin; while the duke of Lanca&s;ter, at the head of twenty five thou&s;and men, had the mortification of &s;eeing his troops dimini&s;hed one half by flying parties, without ever coming to a battle. Such was the picture that pre&s;ent|ed it&s;elf to this victorious monarch in the de|cline of life; and this might well &s;erve as a le&s;&s;on to the princes of the age, that more per|manent advantages are obtained by wi&s;dom than by valour. Added to his other unea&s;i|ne&s;&s;es,
<PB N="121" REF="123">
he had the mortification to &s;ee his au|thority de&s;pi&s;ed at home. It was in vain that he &s;ought refuge, in his age, from the com|plaints of his &s;ubjects, in the arms of a favou|rite mi&s;tre&s;s, who&s;e name was Alice Pierce; this only &s;erved to exa&s;perate his people the more again&s;t him, and to turn their indignation into contempt. But what of all other things &s;erved to gloom the latter part of this &s;plendid reign, was the approaching death of the black prince, who&s;e con&s;titution &s;hewed but too ma|nife&s;tly the &s;ymptoms of a &s;peedy di&s;&s;olution. This valiant and accompli&s;hed prince died in the forty-&s;ixth year of his age, leaving behind him a character without a &s;ingle blemi&s;h; and a degree of &s;orrow among the people, that time could &s;carcely alleviate. His affability, clemency, and liberal di&s;po&s;ition, have been celebrated by different hi&s;torians. Though born in an age, in which military virtues alone were held in e&s;teem, he cultivated the arts of peace; and &s;eemed ever more happy in de&s;er|ving prai&s;e, than in obtaining it.</P>
<P>The king was mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly affected with the lo&s;s of his &s;on; and tried every art to remove his unea&s;ine&s;s; he had bani&s;hed his concubine &s;ome time before from his pre&s;ence, but took her again, in hopes of finding &s;ome con&s;olation
<PB N="122" REF="124">
in her company. He removed him&s;elf entire|ly from the duties and burdens of the &s;tate, and left his kingdom to be plundered by a &s;et of rapacious mini&s;ters. He did not &s;urvive the con&s;equences of his bad conduct; but died about a year after the prince, at Shene, in Surry, de&s;erted by all his courtiers, even by tho&s;e who had grown rich by his bounty. He expired in the &s;ixty-fifth year of his age, and the fifty-fir&s;t of his reign; a prince more ad|mired than loved by his &s;ubjects, and more an object of their applau&s;e, than their &s;orrow.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1377" UNIT="A.D."> The reign of Edward was rather brilliant, than truly &s;erviceable to his &s;ubjects. If England, during the&s;e &s;hining triumphs on the continent, gained any real advantage, it was only that of having a &s;pirit of elegance and honour diffu&s;ed among the higher ranks of the people. In all conque&s;ts, &s;omething is gained in civil life from the people &s;ubdued; and as France was at that time evidently more civilized than England, tho&s;e imitative i&s;lan|ders, as they were then called, adopted the arts of the people they overcame. The meane&s;t &s;oldier in the Engli&s;h army now began to fol|low his leader from love, and not compul&s;ion; he was brave from &s;entiment alone; and had the honour of his country beating in his brea&s;t,
<PB N="123" REF="125">
even though in the humble&s;t &s;tation. This was the time when chivalry was at its high|e&s;t pitch; and many of the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of Eng|land were owing to that romantic &s;pirit, which the king endeavoured to diffu&s;e, and of which he was the mo&s;t &s;hining example. It was this &s;pirit that, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;erved to &s;often the ferocity of the age; being a mixture of love, genero&s;ity, and war. In&s;tead of being taught the &s;ciences, the &s;ons of the nobility were brought into the field as &s;oon as they were able, and in&s;tructed in no other arts but tho&s;e of arms; &s;uch as the method of &s;itting on hor&s;eback, of wielding the launce, running at the ring, flouri&s;hing at a tournament, and addre&s;&s;ing a mi&s;tre&s;s. To attain the&s;e, was con|&s;idered as the &s;um of all human acquirements; and though war made their only &s;tudy, yet the rules of tactics, encampments, &s;tratagems, and fortifications, were almo&s;t totally di&s;regarded.</P>
<P>It was in this reign that the order of the garter was in&s;tituted; <MILESTONE N="1349" UNIT="A.D."> the number received into which was to con&s;i&s;t of twenty four per&s;ons, be&s;ide the king. A vulgar &s;tory prevails, but un&s;upported by any ancient authority, that the counte&s;s of Sali&s;bury, at a ball, happen|ing to drop her garter, the king took it up, and pre&s;ented it to her with the&s;e words,

<Q REND="inline">"Honi &s;oit qui mal y pen&s;e;"</Q> Evil to him, that evil thinks.

<P>Edward left many children by his queen Philippa of Hainault; his elde&s;t &s;on, the black prince, died before him, but left a &s;on, named Richard, who &s;ucceeded to the throne; Ed|ward's &s;econd &s;on was Lionel, duke of Cla|rence; the third was called John of Gaunt, from the place of his birth, and was afterwards created duke of Lanca&s;ter.

</FIGURE>CHAP. XV. RICHARD II.</HEAD>
<P>RICHARD II. came to the throne of his grandfather, when as yet but eleven years of age, and found the people di&s;contented and poor, the nobles proud and rebellious. A &s;pi|rit of profu&s;ion had entered into the kingdom with the &s;pirit of gallantry; which, while it produced indolence and rapacity among the
<PB N="126" REF="128">
higher orders, produced want and di&s;obedience among the poor.</P>
<P>As the king was a minor, the govern|ment was ve&s;ted in the hands of his three uncles, the dukes of Lanca&s;ter, York, and Glouce&s;ter; the difference of who&s;e di&s;po&s;itions, it was &s;uppo&s;ed, would &s;erve to check the de|fects of each other. Lanca&s;ter, though ex|perienced during the late reign in government, was neither popular nor enterprizing; York was indolent and weak; Glouce&s;ter, turbulent, popular, and ambitious. Under the &s;ecret in|fluence of tho&s;e, without any regency being appointed, the whole &s;y&s;tem of government was kept together for &s;ome years; the autho|rity e&s;tabli&s;hed during the former reign, &s;till continuing to operate in this.</P>
<P>But though government was carried on, yet it was not without many commotions, ari&s;ing either from the impatience of the people, or the ambition of the great: as the late king had left the kingdom involved in many dan|gerous and expen&s;ive wars; and as the&s;e de|manded large and con&s;tant &s;upplies, the mur|murs of the people encrea&s;ed in proportion. Nor were they le&s;&s;ened by the manner of car|rying on the&s;e expeditions; which, in general were languid, and upon the whole un&s;ucce&s;sful.
<PB N="127" REF="129">
The duke of Lanca&s;ter laid claim to the crown of Ca&s;tile, and made a fruitle&s;s expedition; the war with France produced no enterprize of lu&s;tre, and that with with Scotland was rather un&s;ucce&s;sful. The expences, however, of the armaments to face the enemy on every &s;ide, and a want of oeconomy in the admini&s;tration, entirely exhau&s;ted the trea&s;ury; and a new tax of three groats, on every per&s;on above fifteen, was granted by parliament as a &s;upply. The indignation of the people had been for &s;ome time encrea&s;ing, but a tax &s;o unequitable, in which the rich paid no more than the poor, kindled the re&s;entment of the latter into flame.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the numbers who by war, by a re&s;idence in towns, and by other means had become free, yet there was &s;till multi|tudes in the country, who had lands in ville|nage, that were only &s;laves to the lords from whom they held. The&s;e had &s;een the advan|tages of liberty, from its effects upon tho&s;e of equal rank who had gone to live in towns; and they panted for a participation of tho&s;e advantages. Several of the&s;e had become opulent enough to purcha&s;e their freedom; but by an unju&s;t act of parliament in this reign, the&s;e purcha&s;es were declared of no validity. This act the pea&s;ants con&s;idered as an infrac|tion
<PB N="128" REF="130">
of the laws of humanity, and &s;uch indeed it mu&s;t be allowed to have been. But it had long been the pre&s;criptive manner of rea&s;oning, to have no regard for the rights of a certain cla&s;s of men, who were &s;uppo&s;ed too low for ju&s;tice. The &s;eeds of di&s;content were &s;till more culti|vated by the preaching of &s;everal men, who went about the country, inculcating the natu|ral equality of mankind; and con&s;equently, the right that all had to an equal participation of the goods of nature. Hitherto we have &s;een popular in&s;urrections only in towns; but we now find the &s;pirit of freedom gaining ground in the country. Our citizens at fir&s;t began to perceive their own &s;trength; and not till after did the pea&s;antry, who had been annexed to the &s;oil, claim a &s;hare in tho&s;e advantages. We in this fir&s;t in&s;tance, find a knowledge of the rights of humanity, diffu&s;ing it&s;elf even to the very lowe&s;t of the people, and exerting it|&s;elf in rude and terrible efforts for freedom.</P>
<P>The minds of the pea&s;ants, being thus pre|pared for in&s;urrection, the manner of collect|ing this unju&s;t poll-tax, &s;oon furni&s;hed them with a pretext for beginning the revolt. It be|gan in E&s;&s;ex, where a report was indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread, that the pea&s;ants were to be de&s;troyed, their hou&s;es burned, and their farms plundered.
<PB N="129" REF="131">
A black&s;mith, well known by the name of Wat Tyler, was the fir&s;t that excited them to arms. The tax-gatherers coming to this man's hou&s;e, while he was at work, demanded payment for his daughter, which he refu&s;ed, alledging that &s;he was under the age mentioned in the act. One of the brutal collectors in&s;i&s;ted on her be|ing a full grown woman; and immediately at|tempted giving a very indecent proof of his a&s;&s;ertion. This provoked the father to &s;uch a degree, that he in&s;tantly &s;truck him dead with a blow of his hammer. The &s;tanders by ap|plauded his &s;pirit; and, one and all, re&s;olved to defend his conduct. He was con&s;idered as a champion in the cau&s;e, and appointed the lea|der and &s;poke&s;man of the people. It is ea&s;y to imagine the di&s;orders committed by this tumultuous rabble; the whole neighbourhood ro&s;e in arms; they burnt and plundered where|ever they came, and revenged upon their for|mer ma&s;ters, all tho&s;e in&s;ults which they had long &s;u&s;tained with impunity. As the di&s;con|tent was general, the in&s;urgents encrea&s;ed in proportion as they approached the capital. The flame &s;oon propagated it&s;elf into Kent, Hertford&s;hire, Surry, Su&s;&s;ex, Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridge, and Lincoln. They were found to amount to above an hundred thou&s;and men,
<PB N="130" REF="132">
by the time they were arrived at Blackheath; from whence they &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the king, who had taken &s;helter in the Tower, de&s;iring a conference with them. With this me&s;&s;age Ri|chard was de&s;irous of complying, but was inti|midated by their fierce demeanour. In the mean time they had entered the city, burning and plundering the hou&s;es of &s;uch as were ob|noxious, from their power, or remarkable for their riches. They broke into the Savoy palace, belonging to the duke of Lanca&s;ter, and put &s;everal of his attendants to death. Their animo&s;ity was particularly levelled a|gain&s;t the lawyers, to whom they &s;hewed no mercy. Such was the vehemence of their fury, that the king began to tremble for his own &s;afe|ty; and, knowing that the Tower was not ca|pable of &s;tanding again&s;t an a&s;&s;ault, he went out among them, and de&s;ired to know their demands. To this they made a very humble remon&s;trance, requiring a general pardon, the abolition of &s;lavery, freedom of commerce in market towns, and a fixed rent in&s;tead of tho&s;e &s;ervices required by the tenure of villenage. As the&s;e reque&s;ts were rea&s;onable, the king &s;oon complied; and charters were accordingly made out, ratifying the grant. In the mean time, another body of the&s;e in&s;urgents had
<PB N="131" REF="133">
broke into the Tower, and murdered the chancellor, the primate, and the trea&s;urer, with &s;ome other officers of di&s;tinction. They then divided them&s;elves into bodies, and took up their quarters in different parts of the city. At the head of one of the&s;e was Wat Tyler, who led his men into Smithfield, where he was met by the king, who invited him to a con|ference, under a pretence of hearing and re|dre&s;&s;ing his grievances. Tyler ordering his companions to retire, till he &s;hould give them a &s;ignal, boldly ventured to meet the king in the mid&s;t of his retinue; and accordingly be|gan the conference. The demands of this de|magogue are cen&s;ured by all the hi&s;torians of the time, as in&s;olent and extravagant; and yet nothing can be more ju&s;t than tho&s;e they have delivered for him. He required that all &s;laves &s;hould be &s;et free; that all commonages &s;hould be open to the poor as well as the rich, and that a general pardon &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed for the late outrages. Whil&s;t he made the&s;e demands, he now and then lifted up his &s;word in a mena|cing manner; which in&s;olence &s;o rai&s;ed the in|dignation of William Walworth, then mayor of London, attending on the king, that, without con&s;idering the danger to which he expo&s;ed his maje&s;ty, he &s;tunned Tyler with a blow of his
<PB N="132" REF="134">
mace; while one of the king's knights riding up, di&s;patched him with his &s;word. The mu|tineers, &s;eeing their leader fall, prepared them|&s;elves to take revenge; and their bows were now bent for execution, when Richard, though not yet quite &s;ixteen years of age, rode up to the rebels, and, with admirable pre&s;ence of mind, cried, out, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What, my people, will you then kill your king? be not concerned for the lo&s;s of your leader; I my&s;elf will now be your general; follow me into the field, and you &s;hall have whatever you de&s;ire."</Q> The awed multitude immediately de&s;i&s;ted; they followed the king as if mechanically into the fields, and there he granted them the &s;ame charter that he had before given to their companions.</P>
<P>The&s;e grants, for a &s;hort time, gained the king great popularity; and it is probable it was his own de&s;ire to have them continued; but the nobles had long ta&s;ted the &s;weets of power, and were unwilling to admit any other to a participation. The parliament &s;oon re|voked the&s;e charters of enfranchi&s;ement and pardon; the low people were reduced to the &s;ame &s;lavi&s;h condition as before, and &s;everal of the ringleaders were puni&s;hed with capital &s;everity. The in&s;urrections of the barons a|gain&s;t their kings, are branded in our hi&s;tory
<PB N="133" REF="135">
with no great air of invective; but the tumults of the people again&s;t the barons, are marked with all the virulence of reproach.</P>
<P>The cruelty which was exerci&s;ed again&s;t the popular leaders upon this occa&s;ion, created no &s;mall enmity again&s;t the king. He had fir&s;t granted them a charter, which implied the ju&s;|tice of their demands; and he was &s;een, &s;oon after, weak enough to revoke what he had be|fore allowed the ju&s;tice of. It is probable al&s;o, that his uncles were not backward in encrea&s;|ing this general di&s;like again&s;t him; as by that means they were more like to continue in their pre&s;ent authority. His own capricious con|duct, indeed, might very well countenance them in the re&s;trictions they placed upon him; as he very &s;oon te&s;tified an eager de&s;ire to go|vern, without any of the requi&s;ites to fit him for &s;uch a difficult undertaking: he &s;oon di&s;|covered an attachment to favourites, without any merit on their &s;ide to entitle them to &s;uch flattering di&s;tinctions. Robert Vere, earl of Ox|ford, a young man, who&s;e per&s;on was faultle&s;s, but who&s;e morals were debauched, had acquired an entire a&s;cendant over him. This nobleman was fir&s;t created marquis of Dublin, and then duke of Ireland, with the entire &s;overeignty, du|ring life, of that i&s;land. He gave him his own
<PB N="134" REF="136">
cou&s;in in marriage; and &s;oon after permitted him to repudiate her for another lady, of whom he was enamoured. He &s;oon became the chan|nel through which all royal favour pa&s;&s;ed to the people; and he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the power, while the king had only the &s;hadow of royal|ty.</P>
<P>A partiality in princes ever produces ani|mo&s;ity among their &s;ubjects. Tho&s;e noble|men, who were either treated with di&s;re&s;pect by the favourite, or who thought that they had them&s;elves better preten&s;ions to favour, in&s;tantly took the alarm, and combined again&s;t him. At the head of this a&s;&s;ociation were Moubray earl of Nottingham, Fitz Alan earl of Arundel, Percy earl of Northumberland, Montacute earl of Sali&s;bury, and Beauchamp earl of Warwick. The&s;e uniting, re&s;olved on the de&s;truction of the favourite; and they be|gan by marking out Michael de la Pole, who was then chancellor, and Oxford's chief friend and &s;upporter, as the fir&s;t object of their ven|geance. He was accordingly impeached in par|liament; and although nothing material was alledged again&s;t him, &s;uch was the intere&s;t of the con&s;piring barons that he was condemned, and deprived of his office.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="137">From puni&s;hing his mini&s;ters, they &s;oon af|ter ventured to attack the king in per&s;on. Un|der a pretence that he was as yet unable to govern,<MILESTONE N="1386" UNIT="A.D."> although he was at that time twenty-one, they appointed a commi&s;&s;ion of fourteen per&s;ons, upon whom the &s;overeign power was to be transferred for a year. This was, in fact, to|tally depriving the king of all power, and op|pre&s;&s;ing the kingdom with a confirmed ari&s;to|cracy. This mea&s;ure was driven forward by the duke of Glouce&s;ter; and none but tho&s;e of his own faction were admitted as members of the committee. It was not without a &s;trug|gle that the king &s;aw him&s;elf thus totally di|ve&s;ted of authority; he endeavoured fir&s;t to gain over the parliament to his intere&s;ts, by influencing the &s;heriffs of each county, who were then the only returning officers. This mea&s;ure failing, he applied to the judges; and they, either from motives of intere&s;t, or from conviction, declared that the commi&s;&s;ion which had deprived him of his authority, was unlawful; and that tho&s;e who procured or ad|vi&s;ed it, were puni&s;hable with death. This &s;entence was quickly oppo&s;ed by declarations from the lords; the duke of Glouce&s;ter &s;aw his danger if the king &s;hould prevail; and &s;ecretly a&s;&s;embling his party, he appeared in
<PB N="136" REF="138">
arms at Haringay Park, near Highgate, at the head of a body of men, more than &s;ufficient to intimidate the king, and all his adherents. The&s;e in&s;urgents, &s;en&s;ible of their own power, were now re&s;olved to make u&s;e of the occa|&s;ion; and began by demanding of the king the names of tho&s;e who had advi&s;ed him to his late ra&s;h mea&s;ures. A few days after they appeared armed in his pre&s;ence, and accu&s;ed, by name, the archbi&s;hop of York, the duke of Ireland, the earl of Suffolk, and Sir Ro|bert Tre&s;ilian, one of the judges who had de|clared in his favour, together with Sir Nicho|las Bember, as public and dangerous enemies to the &s;tate. It was now too late for the op|po&s;ite party to attempt any other vindication of their conduct than by arms. The duke of Ireland fled into Che&s;hire, where he attempted to rai&s;e a body of forces; but was quickly obliged to fly into Flanders, on the arrival of the duke of Glouce&s;ter with a &s;uperior army. Soon after the king was obliged to &s;ummon a parliament; an accu&s;ation was drawn up a|gain&s;t five of his coun&s;ellors; of the&s;e only Sir Nicholas Bember was pre&s;ent; and he was quickly found guilty, condemned, and exe|cuted, together with Sir Robert Tre&s;ilian, who had been di&s;covered and taken during the in|terval.
<PB N="137" REF="139">
But the blood of one or two was not &s;ufficient to &s;atiate the re&s;entment of the duke of Glouce&s;ter; lord Beauchamp of Holt was &s;hortly after condemned and executed; and Sir Simon Burley, who had been appointed the king's governor, &s;hared the &s;ame fate, al|though the queen continued for three hours on her knees before the duke, imploring his pardon.</P>
<P>It might be &s;uppo&s;ed, that after &s;uch a to|tal &s;ubver&s;ion of the royal power, there would be no more &s;truggles, during this reign, be|tween the prince and his nominal &s;ubjects; but whether from the fluctuation of opinions among the people, or from the influence of a military force, which had been lately levied again&s;t France, we find Richard once more re&s;olving to &s;hake of that power, which had long controled him, and actually bringing the parliament to &s;econd his re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>In an extraordinary council of the nobility,<MILESTONE N="1389" UNIT="A.D."> a&s;&s;embled after Ea&s;ter, he, to the a&s;toni&s;h|ment of all pre&s;ent, de&s;ired to know his age; and being told that he was turned of two and twenty, he alledged, that it was time then for him to govern without help; and that there was no rea&s;on that he &s;hould be deprived of tho&s;e rights, which the meane&s;t of his &s;ub|jects
<PB N="138" REF="140">
enjoyed. The lords an&s;wering, in &s;ome confu&s;ion, that he had certainly an indi&s;putable right to take upon him&s;elf the government of the kingdom: <Q>"Yes, replied he, I have long been under the government of tutors; and I will now fir&s;t &s;hew my right to power by their removal."</Q> He then ordered Thomas Arundel, whom the commi&s;&s;ioners had lately appointed chancellor, to give up the &s;eal, which he next day delivered to William of Wickham, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter. He next removed the duke of Glouce&s;ter, the earl of Warwick, and other lords of the oppo&s;ition, from the council. The bi&s;hop of Hereford lo&s;t his office of trea&s;urer; the earl of Arun|del was deprived of the po&s;t of high-admiral; all the great officers of the hou&s;ehold, as well as the judges, were changed; and all the of|fices felt the influence of this extraordinary revolution.</P>
<P>The king being thus left at liberty to con|duct the bu&s;ine&s;s of government at di&s;cretion, began by &s;hewing many marks of moderation towards tho&s;e who before had endeavoured to depre&s;s his power; he &s;eemed to be entirely reconciled to his uncles; and he remitted &s;ome &s;ub&s;idies which had been granted him, that ac|quired him for a time the affections of the
<PB N="139" REF="141">
people. But he wanted tho&s;e arts that are u&s;ually found to procure a la&s;ting re&s;pect; he was fond of luxurious plea&s;ures, and idle o&s;ten|tation; he admitted the meane&s;t ranks to his familiarity; and his conver&s;ation was not adapted to impre&s;s them with a reverence for his morals or abilities. His military talents, on which mankind then placed the greate&s;t va|lue, were &s;eldom exerted, and never with any great &s;ucce&s;s. The French war was &s;carce heard of; and &s;ome &s;ucce&s;sful inroads of the Scotch, particularly that which brought on a di&s;puted victory at Otterbone, were only oppo&s;ed by tho&s;e barons who&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions lay along the frontier. He gained indeed &s;ome reputation for arms in Ireland; but his &s;ucce&s;&s;es there were too in&s;ignificant to give him a deci&s;ive character. From thence, the &s;mall regard which the public bore his per&s;on, di&s;po&s;ed them to murmur again&s;t his admini&s;tration, and to receive with avidity every complaint which di&s;content, or ambition, &s;ugge&s;ted to his pre|judice.</P>
<P>Whether the duke of Glouce&s;ter was &s;e|cretly di&s;plea&s;ed with this mean di&s;po&s;ition in his royal nephew, or wanted to make him&s;elf king by fomenting jealou&s;ies again&s;t him, mu&s;t remain for ever unknown; but certain it is,
<PB N="140" REF="142">
that he u&s;ed every art to encrea&s;e the aver&s;ion of the nation again&s;t him, and to e&s;tabli&s;h his own popularity. He repre&s;ented the peace which had been ju&s;t then concluded with France,<MILESTONE N="1396" UNIT="A.D."> as the re&s;ult of the king's pu&s;ilani|mity; and plau&s;ibly appeared to lament that Richard &s;hould have degenerated &s;o far from the heroic virtues of his father. He fre|quently &s;poke with contempt of the king's per&s;on and government, and deliberated con|cerning the lawfulne&s;s of throwing off all al|legiance to him. The&s;e were in&s;ults that de|&s;erved to be cha&s;ti&s;ed in any &s;ubject; but that called aloud for puni&s;hment in him, who&s;e po|pularity was dangerous, and who more than once had te&s;tified a di&s;po&s;ition to rebel. As all his conduct was &s;ecretly ob&s;erved by the king's emi&s;&s;aries, Richard at length formed a re&s;olution of ridding him&s;elf entirely both of him and his faction, &s;en&s;ible that he then had the parliament entirely at his di&s;po&s;al. He accordingly ordered Glouce&s;ter to be imme|diately arre&s;ted, and &s;ent over to Calais, at which place there was no danger of a re&s;cue from his numerous adherents. The earls of Arundel and Warwick were &s;eized at the &s;ame time; and a parliament was &s;ummoned at We&s;tmin&s;ter, which the king knew to be obe|dient
<PB N="141" REF="143">
to his will. This parliament, as he was apprized, pa&s;&s;ed whatever acts he thought pro|per to dictate; they annulled for ever the commi&s;&s;ion of fourteen, which had u&s;urped upon his authority; they repealed all tho&s;e acts which had condemned his former mini&s;|ters; and revoked the general pardon which the king had granted, upon his a&s;&s;uming the reins of government into his own hands. In con&s;equence of this, &s;everal of the party of Glouce&s;ter were impeached, condemned, and executed. Fitz-Alan, archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury, was bani&s;hed the kingdom, and his tem|poralities &s;eque&s;tered. The earl of Arundel vainly attempted to plead the king's general pardon, to &s;top his execution; the earl of Warwick &s;hewing &s;igns of contrition, had his life &s;pared, but was bani&s;hed to the I&s;le of Man. The greate&s;t criminal yet remained; and a warrant was accordingly i&s;&s;ued to the earl mare&s;chal, governor of Calais, to bring over the duke of Glouce&s;ter to take his trial, as the re&s;t had done. It is probable this no|bleman would have &s;hared the &s;ame fate with the re&s;t of his party; but he was privately di&s;patched in pri&s;on, being &s;mothered, as it afterwards appeared, between two pillows, by his keepers.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="144">The death of a nobleman &s;o popular as the duke, did not fail to encrea&s;e tho&s;e animo&s;ities, which had already taken deep root in the king|dom. The aggrandi&s;ement of &s;ome new fa|vourites, contributed &s;till more to make the king odious; but though he &s;eemed re&s;olved, by all his actions, to &s;et his &s;ubjects again&s;t him, it was accident that gave the occa&s;ion for his overthrow. After the de&s;truction of the duke of Glouce&s;ter, and the heads of that par|ty, a mi&s;under&s;tanding broke out among tho&s;e noblemen, who had joined in the pro&s;ecution. The duke of Hereford appeared in parliament, and accu&s;ed the duke of Norfolk of having &s;poken &s;editious words again&s;t his maje&s;ty, in a private conver&s;ation. Norfolk denied the charge; gave Hereford the lie; and offered to prove his innocence by &s;ingle combat. As proofs were wanting for legal trial, the lords readily acquie&s;ced in that mode of determina|tion; the time and place were appointed; and the whole nation waited with anxious &s;u&s;pen&s;e for the event. At length the day arrived, on which this duel was to be fought; and as combats of this kind were then very prevalent, it may not be ami&s;s to de&s;cribe the ceremonies on that occa|&s;ion. Hereford, the chalenger, fir&s;t appeared on a white charger, gaily capari&s;oned, armed at
<PB N="143" REF="145">
all points, and holding his drawn &s;word. When he approached the li&s;ts, the mare&s;chal demanded his name and bu&s;ine&s;s; to which he replied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am Henry of Lanca&s;ter, duke of Hereford, come hither according to my duty, again&s;t Thomas Mowbray, duke of Norfolk, a fal&s;e traitor to God and the king, the realm and me."</Q> Then taking the oath that his quarrel was ju&s;t and true, he de&s;ired to enter the li&s;ts, which being granted, he &s;heath|ed his &s;word, pulled down his beaver, cro&s;&s;|ed him&s;elf on the forehead, &s;eized his lance, pa&s;&s;ed the barrier, alighted, and &s;ate down in a chair of green velvet, placed at one end of the li&s;ts. He had &s;carce taken his &s;eat when the king came into the field with great pomp, attended by the lords, the count de St Pol, who came from France on purpo&s;e to &s;ee this famous trial, and ten thou&s;and men at arms, to prevent tumults and di&s;turbances. His ma|je&s;ty being &s;eated in his chair of &s;tate, the king at arms proclaimed, that none but &s;uch as were appointed to mar&s;hal the field, &s;hould pre&s;ume to touch the li&s;ts upon pain of death. Then another herald proclaimed aloud, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Behold here Henry of Lanca&s;ter, duke of Here|ford, who has entered the li&s;ts to perform his devoir again&s;t Thomas Mowbray, duke
<PB N="144" REF="146">
of Norfolk, on pain of being counted fal&s;e and recreant."</Q> Ju&s;t then the duke of Nor|folk appeared in arms, mounted upon a barb|ed hor&s;e, with a coat of arms of crim&s;on vel|vet embroidered with lions of &s;ilver, and mul|bery trees; and having taken his oath before the con&s;table and mare&s;chal, entered the field, exclaiming aloud, <Q REND="inline">"God defend the right."</Q> Then alighting from his hor&s;e, he placed him|&s;elf in a chair of crim&s;on velvet oppo&s;ite to his antagoni&s;t, at the other end of the li&s;ts. Af|ter which, the mare&s;chal having mea&s;ured their lances, delivered one to the challenger, and &s;ent a knight with the other to the duke of Norfolk; and proclamation was made that they &s;hould prepare for the combat. Accord|ingly, mounting their hor&s;es, and clo&s;ing their beavers, they fixed their launces in re&s;t, and the trumpets &s;ounded the charge. The duke of Hereford began his career with great vio|lence; but, before he could join his antagoni&s;t, the king threw down his warder, and the heralds interpo&s;ed. By the advice and autho|rity of his parliamentary commi&s;&s;ioners, he &s;topped the combat, and ordered both the combatants to leave the kingdom. The duke of Norfolk he bani&s;hed for life, but the duke of Hereford only for ten years. Thus the one
<PB N="145" REF="147">
was condemned to exile without being charged with any offence, and the other without being convicted of any crime. The duke of Norfolk was overwhelmed with grief and de&s;pondence at the judgment awarded again&s;t him; he retired to Venice, where, in a little time after, he died of a broken heart. Hereford's behaviour on this occa&s;ion was re&s;igned and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, which &s;o plea&s;ed the king, that he con&s;ented to &s;horten the date of his bani&s;hment four years; and he al&s;o granted him letters patent, en&s;uring him the enjoyment of any inheritance which &s;hould fall to him during his ab&s;ence. But nothing could be more fluctuating than Richard's pro|mi&s;es or friend&s;hip. The earl of Hereford re|tiring into Flanders, and from thence to Paris, found there a very favourable reception from the French king. He even opened a treaty of marriage with the daughter of the duke of Berry, uncle to the king of France; but was prevented from completing the alliance by the intere&s;t of Richard, who, dreading the encrea&s;|ing power of the bani&s;hed earl, &s;ent over the earl of Sali&s;bury to Paris, with in&s;tructions to break the match. Such an unexpected injury could not fail to aggravate the re&s;entment of Hereford; but he had &s;till more cogent rea&s;ons for anger, upon the death of his father, the
<PB N="146" REF="148">
duke of Lanca&s;ter, which happened &s;hortly af|ter. Richard, as we before ob&s;erved, had given him letters patent, empowering him to po&s;&s;e&s;s any accidental &s;ucce&s;&s;ions that &s;hould fall to him while abroad; but being now afraid of &s;trengthening the hands of a man whom he had injured, he revoked tho&s;e letters, and re|tained the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Lanca&s;ter e&s;tate to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Such complicated injuries &s;erved to en|flame the re&s;entment of Hereford again&s;t the king; and although he had hitherto con|cealed them, he now &s;et no bounds to his in|dignation; but even conceived a de&s;ire of de|throning a per&s;on who had &s;hewn him&s;elf &s;o unworthy of power. Indeed, no man could be better qualified for an enterprize of this nature than the earl of Hereford: he was cool, cautious, di&s;cerning, and re&s;olute. He had &s;erved with di&s;tinction again&s;t the infidels of Lithuania; and he had thus joined to his other merits, tho&s;e of piety and valour. He was the idol of the &s;oldiery, and the favourite of the people; he was immen&s;ely rich, and by blood, or alliance, connected with all the great families of the nation. On the other hand, the king finding him&s;elf above all re&s;traint, gave him&s;elf up to a &s;oft effeminate life, regardle&s;s
<PB N="147" REF="149">
of his own &s;afety, and of the good of the pub|lic. His mini&s;ters following the example of their &s;overeign, gave little attention to bu&s;ine&s;s; but &s;aw, without any concern, the honour of the nation &s;inking into contempt. In this &s;itua|tion, all people naturally turned their eyes upon the bani&s;hed earl, as the only per&s;on from whom they could expect relief, or redre&s;s. He was &s;timulated by private injuries; and had alliances and fortune &s;ufficient to give weight to his mea&s;ures. The malcontents only wait|ed for the ab&s;ence of the king to put their &s;chemes in execution; and for the&s;e an oppor|tunity was quickly offered.</P>
<P>The earl of Marche, pre&s;umptive heir to the crown, having been appointed the king's lieu|tenant in Ireland, was &s;lain in a &s;kirmi&s;h with the natives of that country, which &s;o incen&s;ed Richard, that, unmindful of his precarious &s;ituation at home, he re&s;olved, with a numerous army, to revenge his death in per&s;on. The duke of Lanca&s;ter (for that was the title which Hereford a&s;&s;umed, upon the death of his fa|ther) being informed of Richard's departure for Ireland, in&s;tantly embarked at Nantz, with a retinue of &s;ixty per&s;ons, in three &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, and landed at Raven&s;pur in York&s;hire. The earl of Northumberland, who had long been a
<PB N="148" REF="150">
malcontent, together with Henry Percy, his &s;on, who, from his ardent valour, was &s;urna|med Hot&s;pur, immediately joined him with their forces. After this junction the con|cour&s;e of people coming to li&s;t under his ban|ner was &s;o great, that in a few days his army amounted to three&s;core thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>The duke of York had been left guardian of the realm during Richard's ab&s;ence; but his efforts were ineffectual, as the mo&s;t powerful per&s;ons who e&s;pou&s;ed the king's intere&s;ts were then actually with him in Ireland. The duke, however, a&s;&s;embled a body of forty thou&s;and men at St Alban's; but found them either quite di&s;pirited, or more attached to the cau&s;e of the rebels, than of the crown. It had been Here|ford's policy, from the beginning, to hide the real motives of his expedition, and to give out that he only aimed at the recovery of his patri|mony and dukedom. Upon the pre&s;ent occa|&s;ion, therefore, he entreated the duke of York not to oppo&s;e a loyal and humble &s;uppliant in the recovery of his ju&s;t rights; but to concur in a mea&s;ure that was more likely to promote the king's honour, than injure his intere&s;ts. York was deceived by the&s;e &s;pecious profe&s;|&s;ions; he declared, that he would not only ap|prove, but a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his preten&s;ions; and
<PB N="149" REF="151">
both armies meeting, embraced with acclama|tions of joy.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e things were tran&s;acting in Eng|land, Richard continued in Ireland in perfect &s;ecurity. Contrary winds, which at that time continued to blow for three weeks together, prevented his receiving any news of the rebellion which was begun in his native dominions. Upon the fir&s;t information, therefore, he immediate|ly impri&s;oned the earl of Hereford's brothers, whom he had taken over with him, and then re&s;olved to go immediately over to fight the ene|my in per&s;on. Yet, ever wavering in his re|&s;olutions, he was per&s;uaded to &s;tay &s;ome time longer, till he could prepare &s;hips to tran&s;port all his forces together. This delay completed his ruin; &s;o that when he landed at Milford|haven with a body of twenty thou&s;and men, he had the mortification to find that the duke of York had already e&s;pou&s;ed the intere&s;ts of his rival, and that his force was every way in|ferior to that of the enemy. He now, there|fore, &s;aw him&s;elf in a dreadful &s;ituation, in the mid&s;t of an enraged people, without any friend on whom to rely; and for&s;aken by tho&s;e, who, in the &s;un&s;hine of his power, had only contributed to fan his follies. His little army gradually began to de&s;ert him, till at la&s;t he
<PB N="150" REF="152">
found that he had not above &s;ix thou&s;and men, who followed his &s;tandard. Thus, not know|ing whom to tru&s;t to, or where to turn, he &s;aw no other hopes of &s;afety, but to throw him&s;elf upon the genero&s;ity of his enemy, and to gain from pity, what he could not obtain by arms. He, therefore, &s;ent Hereford word that he was ready to &s;ubmit to whatever terms he thought proper to pre&s;cribe; and that he earne&s;tly de|&s;ired a conference. For this purpo&s;e, the earl appointed him to meet at a ca&s;tle within about ten miles of Che&s;ter,<MILESTONE N="1399" UNIT="A.D."> where he came the next day with his whole army. Richard, who the day before had been brought thither by the duke of Northumberland, de&s;crying his rival's approach from the walls, went down to receive him; while Hereford, after &s;ome ceremony, entered the ca&s;tle in complete armour, only his head was bare, in compliment to the fallen king. Richard received him with that open air for which he had been remarkable, and kindly bade him welcome. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My lord the king, returned the earl, with a cool re&s;pectful bow, I am come &s;ooner than you appointed; becau&s;e your people &s;ay, that for one and twenty years you have governed with rigour and indi&s;cretion.

<P>But Hereford's haughty an&s;wer was not the only mortification the unfortunate Richard was to endure. After a &s;hort conver&s;ation with &s;ome of the king's attendants, Hereford or|dered the king's hor&s;es to be brought out of the &s;table; and two wretched animals being produced, Richard was placed upon one, and his favourite, the earl of Sali&s;bury, upon the other. In this mean equipage they rode to Che&s;ter; and were conveyed to the ca&s;tle, with a great noi&s;e of trumpets, and through a va&s;t concour&s;e of people, who were no way moved at the &s;ight. In this manner he was led tri|umphantly along, from town to town, amid&s;t multitudes who &s;coffed at him, and extolled his rival. Long live the good duke of Lanca&s;ter, our deliverer! was the general cry; but as for the king, to u&s;e the pathetic words of the poet, <Q REND="inline">"None cryed God ble&s;s him."</Q> Thus, after re|peated indignities, he was confined a clo&s;e pri&s;oner in the Tower; there if, po&s;&s;ible, to undergo a &s;till greater variety of &s;tudied in|&s;olence, and flagrant contempt. The wretch|ed
<PB N="152" REF="154">
monarch, humbled in this manner, began to lo&s;e the pride of a king with the &s;plendours of royalty, and his &s;pirits &s;unk to his circum|&s;tances. There was no great difficultly, there|fore, in inducing him to &s;ign a deed, by which he renounced his crown, as being unqualified for governing the kingdom. Upon this re&s;ig|nation Hereford founded his principal claim; but willing to fortify his preten&s;ions with every appearance of ju&s;tice, he called a parliament, which was readily brought to approve and confirm his claims. A frivolous charge of thirty-three articles was drawn up, and found valid again&s;t the king; upon which he was &s;olemnly depo&s;ed, and the earl of Hereford elected in his &s;tead, by the title of Henry IV. Thus began the conte&s;t between the hou&s;es of York and Lanca&s;ter; which, for &s;everal years after, deluged the kingdom with blood; and yet, in the end, contributed to &s;ettle and confirm the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>When Richard was depo&s;ed, the earl of Northumberland made a motion in the hou&s;e of peers, demanding the advice of parliament, with regard to the future treatment of the de|po&s;ed king. To this they replied, that he &s;hould be impri&s;oned in &s;ome &s;ecure place, where his friends and partizans &s;hould not be
<PB N="153" REF="155">
able to find him. This was accordingly put in practice; but while he &s;till continued alive, the u&s;urper could not remain in &s;afety. In|deed &s;ome con&s;piracies and commotions, which followed &s;oon after, induced Henry to wi&s;h for Richard's death; in con&s;equence of which, one of tho&s;e a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins that are found in every court, ready to commit the mo&s;t horrid crimes for reward, went down to the place of this un|fortunate monarch's confinement, in the ca&s;tle of Pomfret; and, with eight of his followers, ru&s;hed into his apartment. The king con|cluding their de&s;ign was to take away his life, re&s;olved not to fall unrevenged, but to &s;ell it as dearly as he could; wherefore, wre&s;ting a pole|ax from one of the murderers, he &s;oon laid four of their number dead at his feet. But he was at length overpowered, and &s;truck dead by the blow of a poll-ax; although &s;ome a&s;&s;ert, that he was &s;tarved in pri&s;on. Thus died the unfortunate Richard, in the thirty-fourth year of his age, and the twenty-third of his reign. Though his conduct was blameable, yet the puni&s;hment he &s;uffered was greater than his offences; and in the end, his &s;ufferings made more converts to his family and cau&s;e, than ever his mo&s;t meritorious actions could have procured them. He left no po&s;terity, either legitimate or otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="156">It was during this reign, that John Wick|liff, a &s;ecular prie&s;t, educated at Oxford, be|gan to propagate his doctrines; and he has the honour of being the fir&s;t per&s;on who had &s;a|gacity to &s;ee through the errors of the church of Rome, and courage enough to attempt a reformation. He denied the doctrine of the real pre&s;ence, the &s;upremacy of the church of Rome, and the merit of mona&s;tic vows. He maintained that the &s;criptures were the &s;ole rule of faith; that the church was de|pendant on the &s;tate; that the clergy ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s no e&s;tates; and that the numerous ceremonies of the church were hurtful to true piety. In &s;hort, mo&s;t of his doctrines were &s;uch as the wi&s;dom of po&s;terity thought fit to e&s;tabli&s;h; and Wickliff failed in being a reformer, only becau&s;e the minds of men were not yet &s;ufficiently ripened for the truths he endeavoured to inculcate. The clergy of that age did not fail to oppo&s;e Wickliff with fury; but as his doctrines were plea&s;ing to the higher orders of the laity, he found protection from their indignation. John of Gaunt was his particular friend and favourer; and when &s;um|moned to appear before the bi&s;hop of London, that nobleman attended him into the court; and defended him both from the re&s;entment
<PB N="155" REF="157">
of the clergy, and the rage of the populace. However, in proce&s;s of time, he had the &s;atis|faction to &s;ee the people, who were at fir&s;t &s;trongly prejudiced again&s;t him, entirely de|claring in his favour; and although he was often cited to appear before the prelates, yet, from the e&s;timation he was held in, both among the higher and lower ranks of the laity, he was always di&s;mi&s;&s;ed without injury. In this manner he continued during a long life, to le&s;&s;en the credit of the clergy, both by his preaching and writings; and at la&s;t died of a pal&s;y, in the year 1385, at his rectory of Lut|terworth, in the county of Leice&s;ter; while the clergy took care to repre&s;ent his death as a judgment from heaven, for his multiplied he|re&s;ies and impieties.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1399" UNIT="A.D."> NUMEROUS formalities are &s;eldom u&s;ed but to cover di&s;tru&s;t or inju&s;tice. Henry the fourth, knowing the weakne&s;s of his title, was, at lea&s;t, determined to give his corona|tion all po&s;&s;ible &s;olemnity, and to make reli|gion a cloak to cover his u&s;urpation. Accord|ingly, particular care was taken to procure a certain oil, &s;aid to have been pre&s;ented by the
<PB N="157" REF="159">
Virgin Mary to Thomas Becket, during his exile. The phial that contained this precious balm had fallen into the hands of an hermit, who gave it to the duke of Lanca&s;ter, a&s;&s;uring him, that all kings anointed with that oil, would become true champions of the church. On the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, being &s;eized by Henry among the other jewels of Richard, he was anointed with it in all the forms; at the &s;ame time declaring, that he had a&s;cended the throne by the right of conque&s;t, the re&s;igna|tion of Richard in his favour, and as the mo&s;t direct de&s;cendant of Henry the third, king of England. The&s;e were the formalities made u&s;e of to hide his ambition, or perhaps quiet his own fears; for the heir of the hou&s;e of Mortimer, who had in the late reign been de|clared in parliament the true heir of the crown, was &s;till alive, although yet but a boy of &s;e|ven years of age. Him Henry detained, to|gether with his younger brother, in an honour|able cu&s;tody, at Wind&s;or ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the&s;e precautions for his &s;ecurity, Henry &s;oon found that the throne of an u&s;urper is ever a bed of thorns. Such violent animo&s;ities broke out among the ba|rons, in the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of his parliament, that forty challenges were given and received, and
<PB N="158" REF="160">
forty gauntlets thrown down, as pledges of the &s;incerity of their re&s;entment. But though the&s;e commotions were &s;eemingly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by his moderation for that time, yet they &s;oon broke out into rebellion; and a con&s;pi|racy was &s;et on foot for &s;eizing Henry at Wind&s;or, and replacing Richard on the throne, who was &s;uppo&s;ed to be yet alive. This plot was &s;et on foot by the earls of Rutland, Kent, Huntington, and lord Spencer, whom Henry had degraded from &s;uperior titles, conferred upon them by the late king. The particulars of their &s;cheme were committed to writing, and each of the confederates had a copy &s;igned by all the re&s;t. Among the number of the&s;e, the duke of Aumerle was one, furni&s;hed with a paper, which he unfortunately dropt out of his bo&s;om, as he was &s;itting one day at dinner with his father, the duke of York. The fa|ther perceiving &s;omething fall, privately took it up, and to his great a&s;toni&s;hment di&s;covered the contents, which he re&s;olved, with all dili|gence, to di&s;cover to the king, and accordingly rode off with the utmo&s;t expedition to Wind|&s;or, where the court re&s;ided at that juncture. In the mean time, the &s;on finding the &s;ad mi&s;|chance that happened, and gue&s;&s;ing the cau&s;e of his father's expedition, was re&s;olved, if po&s;|&s;ible,
<PB N="159" REF="161">
to prevent his information; and ha&s;ten|ing by a &s;horter way, di&s;covered the whole to the king, and obtained the royal pardon be|fore his father could arrive, who coming &s;oon after, produced the paper, with the names of the con&s;pirators.</P>
<P>In the mean time, while Henry employed the mo&s;t vigorous efforts to di&s;pel the ri&s;ing &s;torm, the con&s;pirators, finding their fir&s;t inten|tions fru&s;trated, dre&s;&s;ed up one of the late king's &s;ervants, named Maudlin, in royal robes, giv|ing out that he was the depo&s;ed monarch, whom they had taken from his pri&s;on, and were willing to replace on the throne. Pity is a pa&s;&s;ion for which the Engli&s;h have ever been remarkable; maje&s;ty in di&s;tre&s;s was an object &s;ufficient, at once, to excite their loyalty and compa&s;&s;ion; and they accordingly flocked in great numbers round the &s;tandard of the con|&s;pirators. Their army &s;oon became con&s;ider|able, and encamped near Cirence&s;ter, while the leaders took up their head-quarters within the city; yet &s;o carele&s;s or inexperienced were they, that they neglected to place proper guards at the gates and the avenues of the place. This was quickly perceived by the mayor of the town, who was in the intere&s;ts of the king; this magi&s;trate a&s;&s;embling four hundred men in
<PB N="160" REF="162">
the night, &s;ecured the gates, &s;o as to exclude the army encamped without, and then he attacked the chiefs within. The earls of Kent and Sa|li&s;bury were taken, after an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, and beheaded on the &s;pot by the mayor's or|der. The earls of Huntington, and lord Spencer, e&s;caped over the tops of the hou&s;es into the camp, in hopes of &s;torming the town at the head of their forces; but they quickly had the mortification to find the tents and bag|gage abandoned by the &s;oldiers, who, upon hearing the noi&s;e and tumult within, had con|cluded, that a party of the king's army had entered privately to &s;trengthen the town&s;men; and under the conviction of this, they fled with the utmo&s;t precipitation.</P>
<P>The two lords perceiving that all hope was over, endeavoured to conceal them&s;elves &s;epa|rately; but they were &s;oon after taken, and lo&s;t their heads upon the &s;caffold by the king's own order. Their deaths were &s;oon after followed by tho&s;e of Sir Thomas Blount, and Sir Bene|dict Sely; and when the quarters of the&s;e un|happy men were brought to London, no le&s;s than eighteen bi&s;hops, and thirty-four mitred abbots, joined the populace, and met them with the mo&s;t indecent marks of joy and exultation. In this &s;hocking proce&s;&s;ion, was &s;een the earl
<PB N="161" REF="163">
of Rutland carrying the head of lord Spencer, his brother in-law, in triumph, after having betrayed him. This mi&s;creant had been long enured to blood and treachery: he was in|&s;trumental in the murder of his uncle, the duke of Glouce&s;ter, to plea&s;e Richard; he &s;oon after de&s;erted the fallen fortunes of that mon|arch, and joined with Henry; not long after, he entered into a con&s;piracy again&s;t this mon|arch, after having &s;worn allegiance to him; and now, at la&s;t, betrayed tho&s;e very a&s;&s;o|ciates whom he had &s;educed into this enter|prize, carrying in triumph the marks of his execrable villainies.</P>
<P>But the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of a &s;ingle rebellion was not &s;ufficient to give quiet to a kingdom, threatened with foreign inva&s;ions, and torn by inte&s;tine di&s;contents. The king of France had actually rai&s;ed a va&s;t armament to invade Eng|land; but a truce was &s;oon after concluded for eight and twenty years; and it was agreed, that queen I&s;abel, who had been married to Rich|ard, but who&s;e marriage had never been con|&s;ummated, &s;hould return to France, her native country. The Scotch, &s;hortly after, began to renew their ancient di&s;turbances; and while the Engli&s;h army marched northward to op|po&s;e their incur&s;ions, the Wel&s;h, on the other
<PB N="162" REF="164">
&s;ide, under the conduct of Owen Glendour, attacked the kingdom upon the defence|le&s;s quarter. Many were the petty victories gained, and the ravages committed on either part in this conte&s;t. The name of Owen Glen|dour is re&s;pected among his countrymen to this very day; but as all his conque&s;ts procur|ed no la&s;ting advantage, and as all his victo|ries only terminated in fame, they are &s;carce worth a place in the page of hi&s;tory. It will be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that whatever honour the Engli&s;h lo&s;t on the &s;ide of Wales, they gained an equivalent on that of Scotland; the Wel&s;h maintained their ground, although their chieftain, Glendour, was taken pri&s;oner, while the Scotch &s;till fled before the Engli&s;h, and would neither &s;ubmit, nor yet give them battle.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1402" UNIT="A.D."> It was in a &s;kirmi&s;h between the Scotch and the Engli&s;h, that Archibald, earl of Douglas, with many of the Scotch nobility, were taken pri&s;oners by the earl of Northumberland, and carried to Alnwick ca&s;tle. This &s;ucce&s;s was con&s;idered at fir&s;t as of &s;ignal advantage; but it was &s;oon attended with con&s;equences that were fatal to the victors. When Henry received intelligence of this victory, he &s;ent the earl orders not to ran&s;om his pri&s;oners, as
<PB N="163" REF="165">
he intended to detain them, in order to en|crea&s;e his demands, in making peace with Scot|land. This me&s;&s;age was highly re&s;ented by the earl of Northumberland, who, by the laws of war that prevailed in that age, had a right to the ran&s;om of all &s;uch as he had taken in battle. The command was &s;till more irk&s;ome, as he con&s;idered the king as his debtor, both for &s;ecurity and his crown. Indeed, the ob|ligations which Henry owed him, were of a na|ture the mo&s;t likely to produce ingratitude on the one &s;ide, and di&s;content on the other. The prince naturally became jealous of that power which had advanced him to the throne; and the &s;ubject thought him&s;elf entitled to every favour the crown had to be&s;tow. Not but that Henry had already conferred the highe&s;t honours upon him; he had made him con&s;table of the kingdom, and given him &s;everal other employ|ments; but nothing could &s;atisfy this nobleman's ambition, while the king had any thing left to give. Accordingly, &s;tung with this &s;up|po&s;ed injury, he re&s;olved to overturn a throne which he had the chief hand in e&s;tabli&s;hing. A &s;cheme was laid, in which the Scotch and Wel&s;h were to unite their forces, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t Northumberland in elevating Mortimer, as the true heir, to the crown of England. When all
<PB N="164" REF="166">
things were prepared for the intended in&s;urrec|tion, the earl had the mortification to find him|&s;elf unable to lead on the troops, being &s;eized with a &s;udden illne&s;s at Berwick. But the want of his pre&s;ence was well &s;upplied by his &s;on Harry Percy, &s;urnamed Hot&s;pur, who took the command of the troops, and marched them towards Shrew&s;bury, in order to join his forces with tho&s;e of Glendour, who, &s;ome time before, had been exchanged from pri&s;on, and had now advanced with his forces as far as Shrop&s;hire. Upon the junction of the&s;e two armies, they publi&s;hed a manife&s;to, which aggravated their real grievances, and invented more. In the mean time, Henry, who had received no intelligence of their de&s;igns, was at fir&s;t greatly &s;urpri&s;ed at the news of this rebellion. But fortune &s;eemed to befriend him on this occa&s;ion; he had a &s;mall army in readi|ne&s;s, which he had intended again&s;t the Scotch, and knowing the importance of di&s;patch again&s;t &s;uch active enemies, he in&s;tantly hur|ried down to Shrew&s;bury, that he might give the rebels battle.</P>
<P>Upon the approach of the two armies, both &s;ides &s;eemed willing to give a colour to their cau&s;e, by &s;hewing a de&s;ire of reconciliation; but when they came to open their mutual de|mands,
<PB N="165" REF="167">
the treaty was turned into abu&s;e and recrimination. On one &s;ide was objected rebel|lion and ingratitude; on the other, tyranny and u&s;urpation. The two armies were pretty near|ly equal, each con&s;i&s;ting of about twelve thou|&s;and men; the animo&s;ity on both &s;ides was in|flamed to the highe&s;t pitch; and no prudence nor military &s;kill could determine on which &s;ide the victory might incline. Accordingly, a very bloody engagement en&s;ued, in which the generals on both &s;ides exerted them&s;elves with great bravery. Henry was &s;een every where in the thicke&s;t of the fight; while his valiant &s;on, who was afterwards the renowned conque|ror of France, fought by his &s;ide, and, though wounded in the face by an arrow, &s;till kept the field, and performed a&s;toni&s;hing acts of valour. On the other &s;ide, the daring Hot&s;pur &s;upport|ed that renown, which he had acquired in &s;o many bloody engagements, and every where &s;ought out the king as a noble object of his indignation. At la&s;t, however, his death, from an unknown hand, decided the victory; and the fortune of Henry once more prevailed. On that bloody day, it is &s;aid that no le&s;s than two thou&s;and three hundred gentlemen were &s;lain, and about &s;ix thou&s;and private men, of whom two thirds were of Hot&s;pur's army.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="168">While this furious tran&s;action was going forward, Northumberland, who was lately re|covered from his indi&s;po&s;ition, was advancing with a body of troops to reinforce the army of the malcontents, and take upon him the com|mand. But hearing by the way of his &s;on's and his brother's misfortune, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his troops, not daring to keep the field with &s;o &s;mall a force, before an army &s;uperior in num|ber, and flu&s;hed with recent victory. The earl, therefore, for a while attempted to find &s;afety by flight, but at la&s;t being pre&s;&s;ed by his pur&s;uers, and finding him&s;elf totally without re&s;ource, he cho&s;e rather to throw him&s;elf upon the king's mercy, than lead a precarious and indigent life in exile. Upon his appearing before Henry at York, he pretended that his &s;ole intention in arming was to mediate be|tween the two parties; and this, though but a very weak apology, &s;eemed to &s;atisfy the king. Northumberland, therefore, received a pardon; Henry probably thinking that he was &s;ufficiently puni&s;hed by the lo&s;s of his ar|my, and the death of his favourite &s;on.</P>
<P>But the extinction of one rebellion only &s;eemed to give ri&s;e to another. The arch|bi&s;hop of York, who had been promoted during the late reign, entered into a confede|racy
<PB N="167" REF="169">
with the earl of Nottingham, and the earl of Northumberland, who had been &s;o lately pardoned, to dethrone the king, and &s;et young Mortimer in his place. Had the forces of the&s;e in&s;urgents co-operated with tho&s;e that were &s;o lately overthrown, it is po&s;&s;ible they might have overpowered any body of men, which the king could bring into the field; but they began their operations ju&s;t when their confederates where defeated. This powerful combination, how|ever, took the field and publi&s;hed a manife&s;to; in which they reproached Henry with u&s;urpa|tion, tyranny, and murder; they required that the right line &s;hould be re&s;tored, and all griev|ances redre&s;&s;ed. The earl of We&s;tmoreland, who had been &s;ent again&s;t them with a very infe|rior force, demanded a conference, to which they readily con&s;ented. The chiefs, on each &s;ide, met at Skipton, near York, and, in the pre&s;ence of both armies, entered upon the &s;ubject of their grievances and complaints. The archbi|&s;hop loudly deplored the nation's injuries and his own; the earl of Shrew&s;bury, not only al|lowed the ju&s;tice of his remon&s;trances, but begged of him to propo&s;e the remedies. The archbi&s;hop entered upon many &s;tipulations, and the earl granted them all. He now, therefore, entreated, that &s;ince they had nothing more
<PB N="168" REF="170">
to a&s;k or to fear, that they would di&s;mi&s;s their forces, and tru&s;t to his honour for the re&s;t. His &s;pecious promi&s;es, and plau&s;ible manners, led them to their ruin. The in&s;urgents im|mediately di&s;banded their troops,<MILESTONE N="1405" UNIT="A.D."> while he gave private orders that his own army &s;hould not di&s;per&s;e till further notice; and thus having di&s;qualified them for defence in|&s;tantly &s;eizing upon the archbi&s;hop, and the earl of Northampton, he carried them to the king. The form of a trial was a very unne|ce&s;&s;ary ceremony, to men who&s;e fate was pre|determined; the archbi&s;hop of York was the fir&s;t prelate who was capitally puni&s;hed in England, the earl of Nottingham &s;hared the &s;ame fate, and the earl of Northumberland found &s;afety by flying into Scotland; but he was &s;lain a year or two after, in an incur&s;ion, by Sir Thomas Roke&s;by, &s;heriff of York&s;hire.</P>
<P>Such advantages &s;eemed to promi&s;e the country, long torn with factions, and threat|ened with inva&s;ions, &s;ome degree of repo&s;e; but a new calamity now began to appear, which, though &s;mall in the beginning, be|came in the cour&s;e of ages, attended with mo&s;t dreadful effects. Since Wickliff had pub|li&s;hed his opinions, in the la&s;t reign, his doctrines met with &s;o many partizans, that
<PB N="169" REF="171">
the clergy began to tremble for their in|fluence over the minds of the people. They, therefore, u&s;ed all their intere&s;t to bring the king over to their party; who had more than once, in former times, declared him&s;elf in fa|vour of the new doctrines. But at pre&s;ent, as he was con&s;cious of the weakne&s;s of his title to the crown, he was re&s;olved to make u&s;e of every &s;upport to confirm his preten&s;ions; and, among others, that offered him by the clergy, was by no means to be thought &s;lightly of. He, therefore, &s;eemed to li&s;ten with great earne&s;t|ne&s;s to their complaints; and took an occa|&s;ion to direct his parliament to attend to the con&s;ervation of the church, which he a&s;&s;erted was then in danger. How reluctant &s;oever the hou&s;e of commons might be, to per&s;ecute a &s;ect, who&s;e crime at any rate was but error, the credit of the court, and the cabals of the clergy, at la&s;t obtained an act for the burning ob&s;tinate heretics. This &s;tatute was no &s;ooner pa&s;t than the clergy re&s;olved to &s;hew that it was not hung out as an empty terror, but that it would be urged with all the force of which it was capable. William Sawtre, a follower of Wickliff, and rector of St. O&s;ithe's, Lon|don, had been condemned by the convocation of Canterbury; and was &s;oon after burned
<PB N="170" REF="172">
alive, by virtue of the king's writ, delivered to the mayor of London. This was the fir&s;t man that &s;uffered death in England for the &s;ake of religion; but the fires once kindled, were not likely to be &s;oon extingui&s;hed, as the clergy had the power of continuing the flame. They ea&s;ily perceived, that a power of burn|ing their enemies would revive that &s;hare of temporal power, which they had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome centuries before; and in this they were not mi&s;taken. They thus again renewed their pri&s;tine authority, but upon very different grounds; for as in the Saxon times they fix|ed their power upon the affections, &s;o they now founded it upon the terrors of the peo|ple.</P>
<P>By the&s;e means Henry &s;eemed to &s;urmount all his troubles; and the calm, which was thus produced, was employed by him in endeavours to acquire popularity, which he had lo&s;t by the &s;everities exerci&s;ed during the preceding part of his reign.<MILESTONE N="1407" UNIT="A.D."> For that rea&s;on, he often permitted the hou&s;e of commons to a&s;&s;ume powers, which had not been u&s;ually exerci&s;ed by their predece&s;&s;ors. In the &s;ixth year of his reign, when they voted him the &s;upplies, they appointed trea&s;urers of their own, to &s;ee the money di&s;bur&s;ed for the purpo&s;es intended;
<PB N="171" REF="173">
and required them to deliver in their accounts to the hou&s;e. They propo&s;ed thirty very im|portant articles for the government of the king's hou&s;hold; and, on the whole, pre&s;erved their privileges and freedoms, more entire during his reign, than that of any of his pre|dece&s;&s;ors. But while the king thus laboured, not without &s;ucce&s;s, to retrieve the reputation he had lo&s;t, his &s;on Henry, prince of Wales, &s;eemed equally bent on incurring the public aver&s;ion. He became notorious for all kinds of debauchery; and ever cho&s;e to be &s;urround|ed by a &s;et of wretches, who took pride in committing the mo&s;t illegal acts, with the prince at their head. The king was not a little mor|tified at this degeneracy in his elde&s;t &s;on, who &s;eemed entirely forgetful of his &s;tation, al|though he had already exhibited repeated proofs of his valour, conduct, and genero&s;ity. Such were the exce&s;&s;es into which he ran, that one of his di&s;&s;olute companions having been brought to trial before Sir William Ga&s;coigne, chief ju&s;tice of the king's bench, for &s;ome mi&s;|demeanor, the prince was &s;o exa&s;perated at the i&s;&s;ue of the trial, that he &s;truck the judge in open court. The venerable magi&s;trate, who knew the reverence that was due to his &s;tation, behaved with a dignity that became
<PB N="172" REF="174">
his office, and immediately ordered the prince to be committed to pri&s;on. When this tran&s;|action was reported to the king, who was an excellent judge of mankind, he could not help exclaiming in a tran&s;port; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Happy is the king, that has a magi&s;trate endowed with courage to execute the laws upon &s;uch an offender; &s;till more happy in having a &s;on, willing to &s;ubmit to &s;uch a cha&s;ti&s;ement."</Q> This, in fact, is one of the fir&s;t great in&s;tances we read in the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, of a magi&s;trate doing ju&s;tice in oppo&s;ition to power; &s;ince, up|on many former occa&s;ions, we find the judges only mini&s;ters of royal caprice.</P>
<P>Henry, who&s;e health had for &s;ome time been declining, did not long out-live this tran&s;|action. He was &s;ubject to fits, which bereav|ed him, for the time, of his &s;en&s;es; and which, at la&s;t, brought on the near approach of death at We&s;tmin&s;ter. As his con&s;titution decayed, his fears of lo&s;ing the crown redoubled, even to a childi&s;h anxiety. He could not be per|&s;uaded to &s;leep, unle&s;s the royal diadem were laid upon his pillow. He re&s;olved to take the cro&s;s, and fight the cau&s;e of the pilgrims to Jeru&s;alem; and even imparted his de&s;ign to a great council, demanding their opinions re|lative to his intended journey: but his di&s;or|der
<PB N="173" REF="175">
encrea&s;ing to a violent degree, he was ob|liged to lay a&s;ide his &s;cheme, and to prepare for a journey of much greater importance. In this &s;ituation, as he was one day in a violent paroxy&s;m, the prince of Wales took up the crown and carried it away; but the king &s;oon after recovering his &s;en&s;es, and mi&s;&s;ing the crown, demanded what was become of it? Be|ing informed that the prince of Wales had car|ried it off: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What! &s;aid the king, would he rob me of my right before my death?"</Q> But the prince ju&s;t then entering the room, a&s;&s;ured his father, that he had no &s;uch motives in what he had done, went and replaced the crown where he had found it; and having received his father's ble&s;&s;ing, dutifully retired. The king was taken with his la&s;t fit, while he was at his devotions before the &s;hrine of St. Ed|ward the Confe&s;&s;or, in We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey, and from thence he was carried to the Jeru&s;a|lem Chamber. When he had recovered from his &s;woon, perceiving him&s;elf in a &s;trange place, he de&s;ired to know where he was, and if the apartment had any particular name: being in|formed that it was called the Jeru&s;alem Cham|ber, he &s;aid, that he then perceived a prophe|cy was fulfilled, which declared that he &s;hould die in Jeru&s;alem. Thus &s;aying, and recommend|ing
<PB N="174" REF="176">
his &s;oul to his Maker; he &s;oon after expir|ed, in the forty-&s;ixth year of his age, and the fourteenth of his reign.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider this monarch on one &s;ide of his character, he will appear an object wor|thy the highe&s;t applau&s;e; if on the other, of our warme&s;t indignation. As a man, he was valiant, prudent, cool, and &s;agacious. The&s;e virtues adorned him in his private character; nor did his vices appear, till ambition brought him within &s;ight of a throne: it was then that he was di&s;covered to be unju&s;t, cruel, gloomy, and tyrannical; and though his reign contributed much to the happine&s;s of his &s;ub|jects, yet it was entirely de&s;tructive of his own. He was twice married; by his fir&s;t wife, Mary de Bohun, he had four &s;ons, Henry his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or, Thomas duke of Clarence, John duke of Bedford, Humphry duke of Glouce&s;ter, and two daughters. By his &s;econd wife he had no i&s;&s;ue.</P>

</FIGURE>CHAP. XVII. HENRY V.</HEAD>
<P>THE death of Henry IV. gave the people but very little concern,<MILESTONE N="1413" UNIT="A.D."> as he had always go|verned them rather by their fears than their affections. But the rejoicings made for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of his &s;on, notwith&s;tanding his ex|travagancies, were manife&s;t and &s;incere. In the very height and madne&s;s of the revel, he would often give in&s;tances of the noble&s;t di&s;|po&s;ition;
<PB N="176" REF="178">
and, though he did not practi&s;e the virtues of temperance, he always &s;hewed that he e&s;teemed them. But it was his courage which in that martial age chiefly won the peo|ple's affection and applau&s;e. Courage, and &s;uper&s;tition, then made up the whole &s;y&s;tem of human duty; nor had the age any other idea of heroi&s;m, but what was the re&s;ult of this combination.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;teps taken by the young king confirmed all tho&s;e prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions entertained in his favour. He called together his former companions, acquainted them with his intend|ed reformation; exhorted them to follow his example; and thus di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them from his pre&s;ence, allowing them a competency to &s;ub|&s;i&s;t upon, till he &s;aw them worthy of further promotion. The faithful mini&s;ters of his fa|ther, at fir&s;t, indeed, began to tremble for their former ju&s;tice, in the admini&s;tration of their duty; but he &s;oon ea&s;ed them of their fears, by taking them into his friend&s;hip and confidence. Sir William Ga&s;coigne, who thought him&s;elf the mo&s;t obnoxious, met with prai&s;es in&s;tead of reproaches, and was exhorted to per&s;evere in the &s;ame rigorous and impartial execution of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="179">But Henry did not &s;top here; he &s;hewed him&s;elf willing to correct, not only his own private errors, but tho&s;e of the former reign. He expre&s;&s;ed the deepe&s;t &s;orrow for the fate of the unhappy Richard, and ordered his fu|neral ob&s;equies to be performed with royal &s;olemnity. He &s;eemed ambitious to bury all party-di&s;tinctions in oblivion, the good men of either party were only dear to him; and the bad, vainly alledged their loyalty as an exte|nuation of their vices. The exhortations, as well as the example of the prince, gave en|couragement to virtue; all parties were equal|ly attached to &s;o ju&s;t a prince, and the defects of his title were forgot, amid&s;t the lu&s;tre of his admirable qualities.</P>
<P>In this manner, the people &s;eemed happy in their new king; but it is not in the power of man to rai&s;e him&s;elf entirely above the preju|dices of the age in which he lives, or to cor|rect tho&s;e abu&s;es, which often employ the &s;aga|city of whole centuries to di&s;cover. The vices of the clergy had drawn upon them the contempt and dete&s;tation of the people; but they were re&s;olved to continue their ancient power, not by reforming them&s;elves, but by per&s;ecuting tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed them. The here&s;y of Wickliff, or Lollardi&s;m, as it was called, be|gan,
<PB N="178" REF="180">
to &s;pread every day more and more, while it received a new lu&s;tre from the protection and preaching of Sir John Old ca&s;tle, baron of Cobham, who had been one of the king's dome&s;tics, and &s;tood high in his favour. His character, both for civil and military excel|lence, pointed him out to Arundel, arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury, as the proper victim of eccle&s;ia&s;tical vengeance; and he applied to the king for permi&s;&s;ion to indict lord Cobham, as a mi&s;creant guilty of the mo&s;t atrocious here&s;y. But the generous nature of the prince was aver&s;e to &s;uch &s;anguinary methods of conver|&s;ion; and he begged leave fir&s;t to be permitted to try what effect the arts of rea&s;on and per|&s;ua&s;ion would produce upon this bold leader of his &s;ect. He accordingly de&s;ired a private conference with lord Cobham; but he found that nobleman ob&s;tinate in his opinions, and determined rather to part with life, than what he believed upon conviction. The king, there|fore, finding him immoveable, gave him up to the fury of his enemies. Per&s;ecution ever propagates tho&s;e errors which it aims at abo|li&s;hing. The primate indicted lord Cobham; and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his &s;uffragans, con|demned him as an heretic to be burnt alive. Cobham, however, e&s;caping from the Tower,
<PB N="179" REF="181">
in which he was confined, the day before his execution, privately went among his party; and &s;timulating their zeal, led them up to London, to take a &s;ignal revenge of his ene|mies. But the king, appri&s;ed of his inten|tions, ordered that the city-gates &s;hould be &s;hut; and coming by night with his guards into St. Giles's fields, &s;eized &s;uch of the con|&s;pirators as appeared, and afterwards laid hold of &s;everal parties that were ha&s;tening to the appointed place. Some of the&s;e were exe|cuted, but the greater number pardoned. Cobham him&s;elf found means of e&s;caping for that time; but he was taken about four years after; and never did the cruelty of man in|vent, or crimes draw down, &s;uch torments as he was made to endure. He was hung up with a chain by the middle; and thus at a &s;low fire burned, or rather roa&s;ted, alive.</P>
<P>Such &s;pectacles as the&s;e mu&s;t naturally ex|cite the di&s;gu&s;t of the people, not only again&s;t the clergy, but the government it&s;elf. Henry, to turn their minds from &s;uch hideous &s;cenes, re&s;olved to take the advantage of the trou|bles in which France was at that time engaged, and pur&s;ue the advice of his dying father, who gave it as his la&s;t in&s;tructions, that he &s;hould employ his &s;ubjects in foreign expeditions, and
<PB N="180" REF="182">
thus give all the re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirits occupation for their inquietude. Charles the fifth, who was then king of France, was &s;ubject to frequent fits of lunacy, which totally di&s;qualified him from reigning. During the paroxy&s;ms of his di&s;ea&s;e, the ambition of his va&s;&s;als and cour|tiers had room for exertion; and they grew powerful from their &s;overeign's weakne&s;s. The admini&s;tration of affairs was di&s;puted between his brother Lewis, duke of Orleans, and his cou&s;in-german, John, duke of Burgundy. I&s;a|bella, his queen, al&s;o had her party; and the king vainly attempted to &s;ecure one al&s;o in his favour. Each of the&s;e, as they happened to prevail, branded their captives with the name of traitors; and the gibbets were at once hung with the bodies of the accu&s;ed and the ac|cu&s;ers. This, therefore, was thought by Henry a favourable opportunity to recover from France tho&s;e grants, that had been formerly given up by treaty. But previou&s;ly, to give his intended expedition the appearance of ju&s;|tice, he &s;ent over amba&s;&s;adors to Paris, offer|ing a perpetual peace and alliance, on condi|tion of being put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all tho&s;e provinces, which had been ravi&s;hed from the Engli&s;h during the former reign, and of e&s;|pou&s;ing Catharine, the French king's daugh|ter,
<PB N="181" REF="183">
in marriage, with a &s;uitable dowry. Tho' the French court was at that time extremely aver&s;e to war, yet the exorbitance of the&s;e de|mands could not be complied with; and Henry very probably made them in hopes of a de|nial. He therefore a&s;&s;embled a great fleet and army at Southampton; and having allur|ed all the military men of the kingdom to at|tend him, from the hopes of conque&s;t, he put to &s;ea, and landed at Harfleur, at the head of an army of &s;ix thou&s;and men at arms, and twenty-four thou&s;and foot, mo&s;tly archers.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t operations were upon Harfleur; which being pre&s;&s;ed hard, promi&s;ed at a certain day to &s;urrender, unle&s;s relieved before that time. The day arriving, and the garri|&s;on, unmindful of their engagement, &s;till re|&s;olving to defend the place, Henry ordered an a&s;&s;ault to be made, took the town by &s;torm, and put all the garri&s;on to the &s;word. From thence, the victor advanced farther into the country, which had been already rendered de|&s;olate by factions, and which he now totally laid wa&s;te. But although the enemy made but a feeble re&s;i&s;tance, yet the climate &s;eem|ed to fight again&s;t the Engli&s;h; a conta|gious dy&s;entery carrying off three parts of Henry's army. In &s;uch a &s;ituation he had re|cour&s;e
<PB N="182" REF="184">
to an expedient common enough in that barbarous age, to in&s;pire his troops with confidence in their general. He challenged the dauphin, who commanded in the French army, to &s;ingle combat, offering to &s;take his preten&s;ions on the event. This challenge, as might naturally be expected, was rejected; and the French, though di&s;agreeing internally, at la&s;t &s;eemed to unite, at the appearance of the common danger. A numerous army of four|teen thou&s;and men at arms, and forty thou|&s;and foot, was by this time a&s;&s;embled, under the command of count Albret; and was now placed to intercept Henry's weakened forces on their return. The Engli&s;h monarch, when it was too late, began to repent of his ra&s;h inroad into a country, where di&s;ea&s;e, and a powerful army, every where threatened de|&s;truction; he therefore began to think of retiring into Calais. In this retreat, which was at once both painful and dangerous, Henry took every precaution to in&s;pire his troops with patience and per&s;everance; and &s;hewed them in his own per&s;on the brighte&s;t example of fortitude and re&s;ignation. He was continually harra&s;&s;ed on his march by flying parties of the enemy; and whenever he attempted to pa&s;s the river Somme, over which his march lay,
<PB N="183" REF="185">
he &s;aw troops, on the other &s;ide, ready to oppo&s;e his pa&s;&s;age. However, he was &s;o fortunate as to &s;eize by &s;urprize a pa&s;&s;age near St. Quintin, which had not been &s;ufficiently guarded; and there he &s;afely carried over his army.</P>
<P>But the enemy was &s;till re&s;olved to intercept his retreat; and after he had pa&s;&s;ed the &s;mall river of Tertrois at Blangi, he was &s;urpri&s;ed to ob&s;erve from the heights, the whole French army drawn up in the plains of Azincourt; and &s;o po&s;ted, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to proceed on his march, without coming to an engagement. No &s;ituation could be more un|favourable than that in which he then found him&s;elf. His army was wa&s;ted with di&s;ea&s;e; the &s;oldiers &s;pirits worn down with fatigue, de&s;titute of provi&s;ions, and di&s;couraged by their retreat. Their whole body amounted but to nine thou&s;and men; and the&s;e were to &s;u&s;tain the &s;hock of an enemy near ten times their number, headed by expert generals, and plentifully &s;upplied with provi&s;ions. This di&s;parity, as it depre&s;&s;ed the Engli&s;h, &s;o it rai&s;ed the courage of the French in propor|tion; and &s;o confident were they of &s;ucce&s;s, that they began to treat for the ran&s;om of their pri&s;oners. Henry, on the other hand, though
<PB N="184" REF="186">
&s;en&s;ible of his extreme danger, did not omit any circum&s;tance that could a&s;&s;i&s;t his &s;ituation. As the enemy were &s;o much &s;uperior, he drew up his army on a narrow ground between two woods, which guarded each flank; and he pa|tiently expected, in that po&s;ition, the attack of the enemy. The con&s;table of France was at the head of one army; and Henry him&s;elf, with Edward, duke of York, commanded the other. For a time both armies, as if afraid to begin, kept &s;ilently gazing at each other, neither be|ing willing to break their ranks by making the on&s;et; which Henry perceiving, with a chearful countenance cried out, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My friends, &s;ince they will not begin, it is ours to &s;et them the example; come on, and the Ble&s;&s;ed Trinity be our protection."</Q> Upon this, the whole army &s;et forward with a &s;hout, while the French &s;till continued to wait their approach with intrepidity. The Engli&s;h archers, who had long been famous for their great &s;kill, fir&s;t let fly a &s;hower of arrows three feet long, which did great execution. The French ca|valry advancing to repel the&s;e, two hundred bow-men, who lay till then concealed, ri&s;ing on a &s;udden, let fly among them, and pro|duced &s;uch a confu&s;ion, that the archers threw by their arrows, and ru&s;hing in, fell upon them
<PB N="185" REF="187">
&s;word in hand. The French at fir&s;t repul&s;ed the a&s;&s;ailants, who were enfeebled by di&s;ea&s;e; but they &s;oon made up the defect by their va|lour; and re&s;olving to conquer or die, bur&s;t in upon the enemy with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that the French were &s;oon obliged to give way.</P>
<P>In the mean time a body of Engli&s;h hor&s;e, which had been concealed in a neighbouring wood, ru&s;hing out, flanked the French infan|try, and a general di&s;order began to en&s;ue. The fir&s;t line of the enemy being routed, the &s;econd line began to march up to interrupt the progre&s;s of the victory. Henry, therefore, alighting from his hor&s;e, pre&s;ented him&s;elf to the enemy with an undaunted countenance; and at the head of his men fought on foot, en|couraging &s;ome, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting others. Eigh|teen French cavaliers, who were re&s;olved to kill him, or die in the attempt, ru&s;hing from the ranks together, advanced; and one of them &s;tunned the king with a blow of his battle-ax. They then fell upon him in a body; and he was upon the point of &s;inking under their blows, when David Gam, a valiant Wel&s;hman, aided by two of his countrymen, came up to the king's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and &s;oon turned the at|tention of the a&s;&s;ailants from the king to them|&s;elves, till at length being overpowered, they
<PB N="186" REF="188">
fell dead at his feet. Henry had by this time recovered his &s;en&s;es; and fre&s;h troops advanc|ing to his relief, the eighteen French cava|liers were &s;lain; upon which he knighted the Wel&s;hmen, who had &s;o valiantly fallen in his defence. The heat of the engagement &s;till encrea&s;ing, Henry's courage &s;eemed al&s;o to encrea&s;e, and the mo&s;t dangerous &s;ituation was where he fought in per&s;on: his brother, who was &s;tunned by a blow, fell at his feet; and while the king was piou&s;ly endeavouring to &s;uccour him, he received another blow him|&s;elf, which threw him upon his knees. But he &s;oon recovered; and leading on his troops with fre&s;h ardour, they ran headlong upon the enemy; and put them into &s;uch di&s;order, that their leaders could never after bring them to the charge. The duke of Alen&ccedil;on, who com|manded the &s;econd line, &s;eeing it fly, re&s;olved, by one de&s;perate &s;troke, to retrieve the fortune of the day, or fall in the attempt. Wherefore running up to Henry, and at the &s;ame time crying aloud, that he was the duke of Alen&ccedil;on, he di&s;charged &s;uch a blow on his head, that it carried off a part of the king's helmet; while, in the mean time, Henry not having been able to ward off the blow, returned it, by &s;triking the duke to the ground, and he was &s;oon kill|ed
<PB N="187" REF="189">
by the &s;urrounding crowd; all the king's efforts to &s;ave him proving ineffectual. In this manner, the French were overthrown in every part of the field; their number, being crowded into a very narrow &s;pace, were incapa|ble of either flying, or making any re&s;i&s;tance; &s;o that they covered the ground with heaps of &s;lain. After all appearance of oppo&s;ition was over, the Engli&s;h had lei&s;ure to make pri&s;on|ers; and having advanced with uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;s to the open plain, they there &s;aw the remains of the French rear-guard, which &s;till maintained a &s;hew of oppo&s;ition. At the &s;ame time was heard an alarm from behind, which proceeded from a number of pea&s;ants, who had fallen upon the Engli&s;h baggage, and were put|ting tho&s;e who guarded it to the &s;word. Henry, now &s;eeing the enemy on all &s;ides of him, began to entertain apprehen&s;ions from his pri&s;oners, the number of whom exceeded even that of his army. He thought it nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, to i&s;&s;ue gene|ral orders for putting them to death; but on the di&s;covery of the certainty of his victory, he &s;topped the &s;laughter, and was &s;till able to &s;ave a great number. This &s;everity tarni&s;hed the glory which his victory would otherwi&s;e have acquired; but all the heroi&s;m of that age is tinctured with barbarity.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="190">This battle was very fatal to France, from the number of princes and nobility &s;lain, or taken pri&s;oners. Among the number of the &s;lain, was the con&s;table of France, the two bro|thers to the duke of Burgundy, the duke of Alen&ccedil;on, the duke of Barre, and the count de Morle. Among the pri&s;oners, were the duke of Orleans, the duke of Bourbon, with &s;everal others of inferior quality. An archbi&s;hop of Sens al&s;o peri&s;hed fighting in this battle. The killed are computed on the whole to have a|mounted to ten thou&s;and men; and as the lo&s;s fell chiefly upon the cavalry, it is pretended, that of the&s;e eight thou&s;and were gentlemen. The number of pri&s;oners are computed at fourteen thou&s;and. All the Eng|li&s;h who were &s;lain did not exceed forty, a number amazingly incon&s;iderable, if we com|pare the lo&s;s with the victory.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1415. Oct. 25." UNIT="A.D."> This victory, how great &s;oever it might have been, was attended with no immediate effects. Henry did not interrupt his retreat a moment after the battle of Azincourt; but carried his pri&s;oners to Calais, and from thence to Eng|land, where the parliament, dazzled with the &s;plendour of his late victories, granted him new &s;upplies, though unequal to the expences of a campaign. With the&s;e &s;upplies and new
<PB N="189" REF="191">
levies,<MILESTONE N="1417" UNIT="A.D."> he once more landed an army of twen|ty-five thou&s;and men in Normandy, and pre|pared to &s;trike a deci&s;ive blow for the crown of France, to which the Engli&s;h monarchs had long made preten&s;ions. That wretched coun|try was now in a mo&s;t deplorable &s;ituation. The whole kingdom appeared as one va&s;t theatre of crimes, murders, inju&s;tice, and deva&s;|tation. The duke of Orleans was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by the duke of Burgundy; and the duke of Burgundy, in his turn, fell by the treachery of the dauphin. At the &s;ame time, the duke's &s;on, de&s;irous of revenging his father's death, entered into a &s;ecret treaty with the Engli&s;h; and a league was immediately concluded at Arras, between Henry and the young duke of Burgundy, in which the king promi&s;ed to re|venge the murder of the late duke; and the &s;on &s;eemed to in&s;i&s;t upon no further &s;tipula|tions. Henry, therefore, proceeded in his conque&s;ts, without much oppo&s;ition from any quarter. Several towns and provinces &s;ubmit|ted on his approach; the city of Rouen was be&s;ieged and taken; Pontoi&s;e and Gi&s;ors he &s;oon became ma&s;ter of. He even threatened Paris by the terror of his power, and obliged the court to move to Troye. It was at this city that the duke of Burgundy, who had ta|ken

upon him the protection of the French king, met Henry in order to ratify that treaty, which was formerly begun, and by which the crown of France was to be transferred to a &s;tranger. The imbecillity into which Charles had fallen, made him pa&s;&s;ive in this remark|able treaty; and Henry dictated the terms throughout the whole negotiation. The prin|cipal articles of this treaty were, that Henry &s;hould e&s;pou&s;e the prince&s;s Catharine; that king Charles &s;hould enjoy the title and dignity of king for life; but that Henry &s;hould be de|clared heir to the crown, and &s;hould be in|tru&s;ted with the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration of the government; that France and England &s;hould for ever be united under one king, but &s;hould &s;till retain their re&s;pective laws and privileges; that Henry &s;hould unite his arms with tho&s;e of king Charles, and the duke of Burgundy, to depre&s;s and &s;ubdue the dauphin and his parti|zans. Such was the tenor of a treaty, too re|pugnant to the real intere&s;ts of both kingdoms to be of long duration; but the contending parties were too much blinded by their re&s;ent|ments and jealou&s;ies, to &s;ee that it is not in the power of princes to barter kingdoms, con|trary to the real intere&s;ts of the community.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="193">It was not long after this treaty, that Henry married the prince&s;s Catharine; after which he carried his father-in-law to Paris, and took a formal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that capital. There he obtained, from the e&s;tates of the kingdom, a ratification of the late compact; and then turned his arms, with &s;ucce&s;s, again&s;t the ad|herents of the Dauphin, who, in the mean time, wandered about a &s;tranger in his own patri|mony, and to his enemies &s;ucce&s;&s;es only op|po&s;ed fruitle&s;s expo&s;tulations.</P>
<P>Henry's &s;upplies were not provided in &s;uch plenty, as to enable him to carry on the war, without returning in per&s;on to prevail upon his parliament for fre&s;h &s;uccours; and, upon his arrival in England, though he found his &s;ubjects highly plea&s;ed with the &s;plendor of his conque&s;ts, yet they &s;eemed &s;omewhat doubtful as to the advantage of them. A treaty, which in its con&s;equences was likely to transfer the &s;eat of empire from England, was not much reli&s;hed by the parliament. They therefore, upon various pretences, refu&s;ed him a &s;upply equal to his exigencies or his demands, but he was re&s;olved on pur&s;uing his &s;chemes; and joining to the &s;upplies granted at home, the contributions levied on the conquered pro|vinces, he was able once more to a&s;&s;emble an
<PB N="192" REF="194">
army of twenty-eight thou&s;and men, and with the&s;e he landed &s;afely at Calais.</P>
<P>In the mean the Dauphin, a prince of great prudence and activity, omitted no opportunity of repairing his ruined &s;ituation, and to take the advantage of Henry's ab&s;ence from France. He prevailed upon the regent of Scotland to &s;end him a body of eight thou&s;and men from that kingdom; and with the&s;e, and &s;ome few forces of his own, he attacked the duke of Clarence, who commanded the troops in Henry's ab&s;ence, and gained a complete vic|tory.</P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t action which turned the tide of &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t the Engli&s;h. But it was of &s;hort duration, for Henry &s;oon after appearing with a con&s;iderable army, the Dau|phin fled at his approach; while many of the places, which held out for the Dauphin in the neighbourhood of Paris, &s;urrendered to the conqueror. In this manner, while Henry was every where victorious, he fixed his re&s;idence at Paris; and while Charles had but a &s;mall court, he was attended with a very magni|ficent one.<MILESTONE N="1421" UNIT="A.D."> On Whit&s;unday the two kings and their two queens with crowns on their heads, dined together in public; Charles re|ceiving
<PB N="193" REF="195">
apparent homage, but Henry com|manding with ab&s;olute authority.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Dauphin was chaced beyond the Loire, and almo&s;t totally di&s;po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the northern provinces. He was even pur&s;ued into the &s;outh, by the united arms of the Engli&s;h and Burgundians, and threaten|ed with total de&s;truction. In this exigence, he found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;pin out the war, and to evade all hazardous actions with a rival who had been long accu&s;tomed to victory. His prudence was every where remarkable; and, after a train of long per&s;ecutions from fortune, he found her at length willing to declare in his favour, by ridding him of an antagoni&s;t that was likely to become a ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Henry, at a time when his glory had nearly reached its &s;ummit, and both crowns were ju&s;t devolved upon him, was &s;eized with a fi&s;tula; a di&s;order, which from the un&s;kilfulne&s;s of the phy&s;icians of the times, &s;oon became mor|tal. Perceiving his di&s;temper incurable; and that his end was approaching, he &s;ent for his brother the duke of Bedford, the earl of War|wick, and a few other noblemen, whom he had honoured with his confidence; and to them he delivered, in great tranquility, his la&s;t will with regard to the government of his kingdom
<PB N="194" REF="196">
and family. He recommended his &s;on to their protection; and though he regretted the be|ing unable to accompli&s;h the great object of his ambition, in totally &s;ubduing France, yet he expre&s;&s;ed great indifference at the approach of death; he devoutly waited its arrival, and ex|pired with the &s;ame intrepidity with which he had lived, in the thirty-fourth year of his age, and the tenth year of his reign.</P>
<P>This prince po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many virtues, but his military &s;ucce&s;&s;es gave him credit for more than he really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. It is certain, however, that he had the talent of attaching his friends by affa|bility, and of gaining his enemies by addre&s;s and clemency. Yet his reign was rather &s;plendid than profitable; the trea&s;ures of the nation were lavi&s;hed on conque&s;ts, that even though they could have been maintained, would have proved injurious to the nation. Neverthele&s;s he died fortunate, by falling in the mid&s;t of his triumphs, and leaving his &s;ubjects in the very height of his reputation. Charles, who died two months after him, fini&s;hed a wretched reign, long pa&s;t in frenzy and con|tempt, de&s;pi&s;ed by his friends, in&s;ulted by his allies, and leaving the mo&s;t mi&s;erable &s;ub|jects upon earth.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="197">Henry left by his queen, Catherine of France, only one &s;on not full nine months old, who &s;ucceeded him on the throne; and who&s;e mis|fortunes, during the cour&s;e of a long reign, &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all the glories and &s;ucce&s;&s;es of his father.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h triumphs, at this time, in France, produced &s;carce any good effects at home; as they grew warlike, they became &s;avage, and, panting after foreign po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, forgot the arts of cultivating tho&s;e that lay nearer home. Our language, in&s;tead of improving, was more neglected than before; Langland and Chau|cer had begun to poli&s;h it, and enrich it with new and elegant con&s;tructions; but it now was &s;een to relap&s;e into its former rudene&s;s, and no poet or hi&s;torian of note was born in this tempe&s;tuous period.</P>

</FIGURE>CHAP. XVIII. HENRY VI.</HEAD>
<P>HENRY VI. &s;ucce&s;&s;or to Henry V. was not quite a year old when he came to the throne; and his relations began, &s;oon after, to di&s;pute the admini&s;tration of government dur|ing his minority. The duke of Bedford, one of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed princes of the age, and equally experienced,<MILESTONE N="1422" UNIT="A.D."> both in the cabinet and the field, was appointed by parliament
<PB N="197" REF="199">
protector of England, defender of the church, and fir&s;t coun&s;ellor to the king. His brother, the duke of Glouce&s;ter, was fixed upon to go|vern in his ab&s;ence, while he conducted the war in France; and, in order to limit the power of both brothers, a council was named, without who&s;e advice and approbation no mea&s;ure of importance could be carried into execution.</P>
<P>Things being adju&s;ted in this manner, as the conduct of military operations was at that time con&s;idered in a much &s;uperior light to civil em|ployments at home, the duke of Bedford fix|ed his &s;tation in France, to pro&s;ecute the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es of the Engli&s;h in that part of their do|minions, and to repre&s;s the attempts of Charles VII. who &s;ucceeded his father to a nomi|nal throne. Nothing could be more deplora|ble than the &s;ituation of that monarch on a&s;|&s;uming his title to the crown. The Engli&s;h were ma&s;ters of almo&s;t all France; and Henry VI. though yet but an infant,<MILESTONE N="1423" UNIT="A.D."> was &s;olemnly inve&s;ted with regal power by legates from Paris. The duke of Bedford was at the head of a numerous army, in the heart of the king|dom, ready to oppo&s;e every in&s;urrection; while the duke of Burgundy, who had entered into a firm confederacy with him, &s;till remained &s;tedfa&s;t, and &s;econded his claims. Yet, not|with&s;tanding
<PB N="198" REF="200">
the&s;e unfavourable appearances, Charles (who though yet but twenty, united the prudence of age with the affability of youth) found means to break the leagues formed again&s;t him, and to bring back his &s;ubjects to their natural intere&s;ts and their duty.</P>
<P>However, his fir&s;t attempts were totally de&s;|titute of &s;ucce&s;s; wherever he endeavoured to face the enemy he was overthrown, and he could &s;carcely rely on the friends next his per|&s;on. His authority was in&s;ulted even by his own &s;ervants; advantage after advantage was gained again&s;t him, and a battle fought near Vernueil, in which he was totally defeated by the duke of Bedford, &s;eemed to render his affairs wholly de&s;perate. However, from the im|po&s;&s;ibility of the Engli&s;h keeping the field without new &s;upplies, Bedford was obliged to retire into England, and in the mean time his vigilant enemy began to recover from his late con&s;ternation. Dumois, one of his gene|rals, at the head of a thou&s;and men, compelled the earl of Warwick to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Mon|targis; and this advantage, &s;light as it was, began to make the French &s;uppo&s;e that the Engli&s;h were not invincible.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="201">But they &s;oon had &s;till greater rea&s;on to triumph in their change of fortune, and a new revolution was produced by means apparently the mo&s;t unlikely to be attended with &s;ucce&s;s. The a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of a female of the humble&s;t birth, and meane&s;t education, &s;erved to turn the tide of victory in their favour; and impre&s;s their enemies with tho&s;e terrors, which had hitherto rendered them unequal in the field. By this feeble aid, the vanqui&s;hed became the vic|tors; and the Engli&s;h every where wor&s;ted, were at length totally expelled the kingdom.</P>
<P>In the village of Domremi, near Vaucouleurs, on the borders of Lorrain, there lived a coun|try girl, about twenty-&s;even years of age, cal|led Joan of Arc. This girl had been a &s;ervant at a &s;mall inn; and in that humble &s;tation had &s;ubmitted to tho&s;e hardy employments which fit the body for the fatigues of war. She was of an irreproachable life, and had hitherto te&s;ti|fied none of tho&s;e enterprizing qualities which di&s;played them&s;elves &s;oon after. She conten|tedly fulfilled the duties of her &s;ituation, and was remarkable only for her mode&s;ty, and love of religion. But the mi&s;eries of her country &s;eemed to have been one of the great|e&s;t objects of her compa&s;&s;ion and regard. Her king expelled his native throne, her country
<PB N="200" REF="202">
laid in blood, and &s;trangers executing unnum|bered rapines before her eyes, were &s;ufficient to excite her re&s;entment, and to warm her heart with a de&s;ire of redre&s;s. Her mind en|flamed by the&s;e objects, and brooding with melancholy &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s upon them, began to feel &s;everal impul&s;es, which &s;he was willing to mi&s;take for the in&s;pirations of heaven. Con|vinced of the reality of her own admonitions, &s;he had recour&s;e to one Baudricourt, governor of Vaucouleurs, and informed him of her de&s;ti|nation by heaven, to free her native country from its fierce invaders. Baudricourt treated her at fir&s;t with &s;ome neglect; but her impor|tunities at length prevailed; and, willing to make a trial of her preten&s;ions, he gave her &s;ome attendants, who conducted her to the French court, which at that time re&s;ided at Chinon.</P>
<P>The French court were probably &s;en&s;ible of the weakne&s;s of her preten&s;ions; but they were willing to make u&s;e of every artifice to &s;upport their declining fortunes. It was therefore given out, that Joan was actually in&s;pired; that &s;he was able to di&s;cover the king among the num|ber of his courtiers, although he had laid a&s;ide all the di&s;tinctions of his authority; that &s;he had told him &s;ome &s;ecrets, which were only known
<PB N="201" REF="203">
to him&s;elf; and that &s;he had demanded, and minutely de&s;cribed, a &s;word in the church of St. Catharine de Fierbois, which &s;he had never &s;een. In this manner, the minds of the vulgar being prepared for her appearance, &s;he was armed cap-&agrave;-pee, mounted on a charger, and &s;hewn in that martial dre&s;s to the people. She was then brought before the doctors of the univer&s;ity; and they, tinctured with the credulity of the times, or willing to &s;econd the impo&s;ture, declared that &s;he had actually re|ceived her commi&s;&s;ion from above.</P>
<P>When the preparations for her mi&s;&s;ion were completely blazoned, their next aim was to &s;end her again&s;t the enemy. The Eng|li&s;h were at that time be&s;ieging the city of Orleans, the la&s;t re&s;ource of Charles, and every thing promi&s;ed them a &s;peedy &s;urrender. Joan undertook to rai&s;e the &s;iege; and to render her|&s;elf &s;till more remarkable, girded her&s;elf with the miraculous &s;word, of which &s;he had before &s;uch extraordinary notices. Thus equipped, &s;he ordered all the &s;oldiers to confe&s;s them&s;elves before they &s;et out, &s;he di&s;played in her hand a con&s;ecrated banner, and a&s;&s;ured the troops of certain &s;ucce&s;s. Such confidence on her &s;ide &s;oon rai&s;ed the &s;pirits of the French army; and even the Engli&s;h, who pretended
<PB N="202" REF="204">
to de&s;pi&s;e her efforts, felt them&s;elves &s;ecretly influenced with the terrors of her mi&s;&s;ion. A &s;upply of provi&s;ions was to be conveyed into the town; Joan, at the head of &s;ome French troops, covered the embarkation, and entered Orleans at the head of the convoy, which &s;he had &s;afely protected. While &s;he was leading her troops along, a dead &s;ilence and a&s;toni&s;hment reigned among the Engli&s;h; and they regarded with religious awe that temerity, which they thought nothing but &s;upernatural a&s;&s;i&s;tance could in&s;pire. But they were &s;oon rouzed from their &s;tate of amazement by a &s;ally from the town; Joan led on the be&s;ieged, bearing the &s;acred &s;tandard in her hand, encouraging them with her words and actions, bringing them up to the trenches, and overpowering the be&s;iegers in their own redoubts. In the attack of one of the forts, &s;he was wounded in the neck with an arrow; but in&s;tantly pulling out the weapon with her own hands, and getting the wound quickly dre&s;&s;ed, &s;he ha&s;tened back to head the troops, and to plant her victorious banner on the ramparts of the enemy. The&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es continuing, the Engli&s;h found that it was impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t troops ani|mated by &s;uch &s;uperior energy; and Suffolk, who conducted the attack, thinking that it
<PB N="203" REF="205">
might prove extremely dangerous to remain any longer in the pre&s;ence of &s;uch a courage|ous and victorious enemy, rai&s;ed the &s;iege, and retreated with all imaginable precaution.</P>
<P>From being attacked, the French now in turn became the aggre&s;&s;ors. Charles formed a body of &s;ix thou&s;and men, and &s;ent them to be&s;iege Jergeau, whither the Engli&s;h, com|manded by the earl of Suffolk, had retired, with a detachment of his army. The city was taken; Suffolk yielded him&s;elf a pri&s;oner; and Joan marched into the place in triumph, at the head of the army. A battle was &s;oon after fought near Patay, where the Engli&s;h were wor&s;ted, as before; and the generals, Scales and Talbot, were taken pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>The rai&s;ing of the &s;iege of Orleans was one part of the maid's promi&s;e to the king of France; the crowning him at Rheims was the other. She now declared, that it was time to complete that ceremony; and Charles, in pur|&s;uance of her advice, &s;et out for Rheims, at the head of twelve thou&s;and men. The towns through which he pa&s;&s;ed opened their gates to receive him; and Rheims &s;ent him a depu|tation, with its keys, upon his approach. The ceremony of his coronation was there per|formed with the utmo&s;t &s;olemnity; and the
<PB N="204" REF="206">
maid of Orleans (for &s;o &s;he was now called) &s;eeing the completion of her mi&s;&s;ion, de&s;ired leave to retire, alledging, that &s;he had now ac|compli&s;hed the end of her calling. But her &s;ervices had been &s;o great, that the king could not think of parting; her pre&s;&s;ed her to &s;tay &s;o earne&s;tly, that &s;he at length complied with his reque&s;t.</P>
<P>A tide of &s;ucce&s;&s;es followed the perform|ance of this &s;olemnity; Laon, Soi&s;&s;ons, Cha|teau-Thierri, Provins, and many other towns and fortre&s;&s;es in that neighbourhood, &s;ubmitted to him on the fir&s;t &s;ummons. On the other hand, the Engli&s;h, di&s;comfited and di&s;pirited, fled on every quarter, unknowing whether to a&s;|cribe their misfortunes to the power of &s;orce|ry, or to a cele&s;tial influence; but equally ter|rified at either. They now found them&s;elves deprived of the conque&s;ts they had gained, in the &s;ame manner as the French had formerly &s;ubmitted to their power. Their own divi&s;ions, both abroad and at home unfitted them entire|ly for carrying on the war; and the duke of Bedford, notwith&s;tanding all his prudence, &s;aw him&s;elf dive&s;ted of his &s;trong holds in the country, without being able to &s;top the ene|mies progre&s;s. In order, therefore, to revive the declining &s;tate of his affairs, he re&s;olved to
<PB N="205" REF="207">
have Henry crowned king at Paris, knowing that the natives would be allured to obedience, by the &s;plendour of the ceremony.<MILESTONE N="143O" UNIT="A.D."> Henry was accordingly crowned, all the va&s;&s;als that &s;till continued under the Engli&s;h power &s;wear|ing fealty and homage. But it was now too late for the ceremonies of a coronation to give a turn to the affairs of the Engli&s;h; the gene|rality of the kingdom had declared again&s;t them; and the remainder only waited a con|venient opportunity to follow the example.</P>
<P>An accident en&s;ued &s;oon after, which, though it promi&s;ed to promote the Engli&s;h cau&s;e in France, in the end &s;erved to render it odious, and conduced to the total evacuation of that country. The duke of Burgundy, at the head of a powerful army, had laid &s;iege to Compeign; and the maid of Orleans had thrown her&s;elf into the place, contrary to the wi&s;hes of the governor, who did not de&s;ire the company of one who&s;e authority would be greater than his own. The garri&s;on, how|ever, were rejoiced at her appearance, and be|lieved them&s;elves invincible under her pro|tection. But their joy was of &s;hort duration; for Joan having the day after her arrival headed a &s;ally, and twice driven the enemy from their intrenchments, &s;he was at la&s;t obliged to re|tire,
<PB N="206" REF="208">
placing her&s;elf in the rear, to protect the retreat of her forces. But in the end, at|tempting to follow her troops into the city, &s;he found the gates &s;hut, and the bridge drawn up by order of the governor, who is &s;aid to have long wi&s;hed an opportunity of delivering her up to the enemy.</P>
<P>Nothing could exceed the joy of the be|&s;iegers, in having taken a per&s;on who had been &s;o long a terror to their arms. The &s;er|vice of Te Deum was publicly celebrated on this occa&s;ion; and it was hoped that the capture of this extraordinary per&s;on would re|&s;tore the Engli&s;h to their former victories and &s;ucce&s;&s;es. The duke of Bedford was no &s;ooner informed of her being taken, than he pur|cha&s;ed her of the count Vendome, who had made her his pri&s;oner, and ordered her to be committed to clo&s;e confinement. The credulity of both nations was at that time &s;o great, that nothing was too ab&s;urd to gain belief, that coincided with their pa&s;&s;ions. As Joan but a little before, from her &s;ucce&s;&s;es, was regarded as a &s;aint, &s;he was now, upon her captivity, con&s;idered as a &s;orcere&s;s, for|&s;aken by the daemon who had granted her a fallacious and temporary a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Accord|ingly, it was re&s;olved in council to &s;end her to
<PB N="207" REF="209">
Rouen to be tried for witchcraft; and the bi|&s;hop of Beauvais, a man wholly devoted to the Engli&s;h intere&s;t, pre&s;ented a petition again&s;t her for that purpo&s;e. The univer&s;ity of Pa|ris was &s;o mean as to join in the &s;ame reque&s;t. Several prelates, among whom the cardinal of Winche&s;ter was the only Engli&s;hman, were appointed as her judges. They held their court in Rouen, where Henry then re&s;ided; and the maid, cloathed in her former military apparel, but loaded with irons, was produced before this tribunal. Her behaviour there no way di&s;graced her former gallantry; &s;he betrayed neither weakne&s;s, nor womani&s;h &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; but appealed to God and the pope for the truth of her former revelations. In the i&s;&s;ue, &s;he was found guilty of here&s;y and witchcraft, and &s;entenced to be burnt alive, the common puni&s;hment for &s;uch offences.</P>
<P>But previous to the infliction of this dread|ful &s;entence upon her, they were re&s;olved to make her abjure her former errors; and at length &s;o far prevailed upon her, by terror and rigorous treatment, that her &s;pirits were en|tirely broken, by the hard&s;hips &s;he was obliged to &s;uffer. Her former vi&s;ionary dreams began to vani&s;h, and a gloomy di&s;tru&s;t to take place of her late in&s;pirations. She publicly declared
<PB N="208" REF="210">
her&s;elf willing to recant, and promi&s;ed never more to give way to the vain delu&s;ions which had hitherto mi&s;led her, and impo&s;ed on the people. This was what her oppre&s;&s;ors de|&s;ired; and willing to &s;hew &s;ome appearance of mercy, they changed her &s;entence into perpe|tual impri&s;onment, and to be fed during life on bread and water. But the rage of her ene|mies was not yet &s;atiated. Perfectly &s;atisfied of her guilt, they were willing to know if her reformation was equally certain. Su&s;pect|ing that the female dre&s;s, which &s;he had con&s;ented to wear, was di&s;agreeable to her, they purpo&s;ely placed in her apartment a &s;uit of men's apparel, and watched for the effect of their temptation upon her. Their cruel ar|tifices prevailed. Joan, &s;truck with the &s;ight of a dre&s;s in which &s;he had gained &s;o much glory, immediately threw off her penitent's robes, and put on the forbidden garment. Her enemies caught her equipped in this man|ner; and her imprudence was con&s;idered as a re|lap&s;e into her former tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. No recan|tation would &s;uffice, and no pardon would be granted to her. She was condemned to be burnt alive in the market-place of Rouen; and this infamous &s;entence was accordingly executed upon her.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="211">Super&s;tition adds virulence to the natural cruelty of mankind; and this cruel &s;entence &s;erved only to enflame the hatred between the contending powers, without mending the cau&s;e of the invaders. One of the fir&s;t misfortunes which the Engli&s;h felt after this puni&s;hment, was the defection of the duke of Burgundy, who had for &s;ome time &s;een the error of his conduct, and wi&s;hed to break an unnatural connection, that only &s;erved to involve his country in ruin. A treaty was therefore be|gun, and concluded, between him and Charles, in which the latter made all the atonements po&s;&s;ible for his offence; and the former agreed to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in driving the Engli&s;h out of France. This was a mortal blow to their cau&s;e; and &s;uch was its effects upon the populace in London, when they were informed of it, that they killed &s;everal of the duke of Burgundy's &s;ubjects, who happened to be among them at that time. It might perhaps al&s;o have ha&s;tened the duke of Bed|ford's death, who died at Rouen a few days after the treaty was concluded; and the earl of Cambridge was appointed his &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the regency of France.</P>
<P>From this period, the Engli&s;h affairs be|came totally irretrievable. The city of Paris

returned once more to a &s;en&s;e of its duty. Lord Willoughby, who commanded it for the Engli&s;h, was contented to &s;tipulate for the &s;afe retreat of his troops to Normandy. Thus ground was continually, though &s;lowly, gained by the French; and notwith&s;tanding their fields were laid wa&s;te, and their towns depopulated, yet they found protection from the weakne&s;s and divi&s;ions of the Engli&s;h. At length, both parties began to grow weary of a war, which, though carried on but feebly, was yet a bur|then greater than either could &s;upport. But the terms of peace in&s;i&s;ted upon by both were &s;o wide of each other, that no hopes of an accommodation could quickly be ex|pected. A truce, therefore, for twenty-two months was concluded, which left every thing on the pre&s;ent footing between the parties. No &s;ooner was this agreed upon,<MILESTONE N="1443" UNIT="A.D."> than Charles employed him&s;elf with great indu&s;try and judgment in repairing tho&s;e numberle&s;s ills, to which his kingdom, from the continuance of wars, both foreign and dome&s;tic, had &s;o long been expo&s;ed.

occa&s;ion of breaking the truce; <MILESTONE N="1443" UNIT="A.D."> and Normandy was at the &s;ame time invaded by four powerful armies; one commanded by Charles him&s;elf, a &s;econd by the duke of Brittany, a third by the duke of Alen&ccedil;on, and a fourth by the count Dunois. Every place opened their gates almo&s;t as &s;oon as the French appeared before them. Rouen was the only town that pro|mi&s;ed to hold out a &s;iege; but the inhabitants clamoured &s;o loud for a &s;urrender, that the duke of Somer&s;et, who commanded the garri&s;on, was obliged to capitulate. The battle, or rather the &s;kirmi&s;h, of Fourmingi, was the la&s;t &s;tand which the Engli&s;h made in defence of their French dominions. However, they were put to the rout, and above a thou&s;and were &s;lain. All Normandy and Guienne, that had &s;o long acknowleged &s;ubjection to England, were lo&s;t in the &s;pace of a year; and the Engli&s;h at length &s;aw them&s;elves entirely di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a country, which for above three centuries they had con&s;idered as annexed to their native dominions. Calais alone remained of all their conque&s;ts; and this was but a &s;mall compen|&s;ation for the blood and trea&s;ure which had been lavi&s;hed in that country, and only &s;erved to gratify ambition with a tran&s;ient applau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="214">It may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the bad &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es in France, which began almo&s;t with young Henry's reign, produced di&s;&s;en&s;ions and factions among the rulers at home. The duke of Glouce&s;ter, who had been appointed regent of England during his brother's ab&s;ence, was not &s;o &s;ecure in his place, but that he had many who envied his &s;ituation. Among the number of the&s;e was Henry Beaufort, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, great uncle to the king, and the legitimate &s;on of John of Gaunt. This prelate, to whom the care of the king's per|&s;on and education had been entru&s;ted, was a man of great capacity and experience, but of an intriguing and dangerous di&s;po&s;ition. As he a&s;pired to the government of affairs, he had continual di&s;putes with the duke of Glou|ce&s;ter, and gained frequent advantages over the open temper of that prince. It was in vain that the duke of Bedford employed all his own authority, and that of parliament, to reconcile them; their mutual animo&s;ities &s;erv|ed for &s;everal years to embarra&s;s government, and to give its enemies every advantage. The &s;entiments of the&s;e two leaders of their party were particularly divided with re|gard to France. The cardinal encouraged every propo&s;al of accommodation with that
<PB N="213" REF="215">
country; the duke of Glouce&s;ter was for maintaining the honour of the Engli&s;h arms, and winning back all that had been lo&s;t by de|feats or delay. In this conte&s;t, the powers &s;eemed nearly divided; and it became incum|bent on one &s;ide to call in new auxiliaries, be|fore either party could turn the political &s;cale. For this purpo&s;e, the cardinal was re&s;olved to &s;trengthen him&s;elf, by procuring a &s;uitable match for Henry, who was now twenty-three years old; and then, by bringing the new made queen over to his intere&s;ts, to turn the balance in his favour. Accordingly, the earl of Suf|folk, a nobleman whom he knew to be &s;tedfa&s;t in his attachments, was &s;ent over to France, apparently to &s;ettle the terms of the truce, which had been then begun; but, in reality, to procure a &s;uitable match for the king. The duke of Glouce&s;ter had before propo&s;ed a daughter of the count Armagnac, but had not influence &s;ufficient to prevail. The cardinal and his friends had ca&s;t their eye on Margaret of Anjou, daughter of Regnier, titular king of Sicily, Naples, and Jeru&s;alem; but with|out either real power or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. This prince&s;s was con&s;idered as the mo&s;t accom|pli&s;hed of the age, both in mind and per|&s;on; and it was thought would, by her own
<PB N="214" REF="216">
abilities, be able to &s;upply the defects of her con&s;ort, who already appeared weak, timid, and &s;uper&s;titious. The treaty was therefore ha&s;tened on by Suffolk, and the marriage &s;oon after ratified in England.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1443" UNIT="A.D."> The cardinal now &s;trengthened by this new alliance (for the queen came immediately into his mea&s;ures), the duke of Glouce&s;ter &s;oon found him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of only the &s;hadow of power without the &s;ub&s;tance; all his mea&s;ures were over-ruled by his powerful antagoni&s;t; and he daily found him&s;elf in&s;ulted in the mo&s;t cruel manner. One of the principal &s;teps his enemies took to render him odious, was to ac|cu&s;e his wife, the dutche&s;s, of witchcraft. She was charged with conver&s;ing with one Roger Bolingbroke, a prie&s;t, and reputed ne|cromancer; and al&s;o one Mary Gurdemain, who was &s;aid to be a witch. It was a&s;&s;erted that the&s;e three in conjunction had made a fi|gure of the king in wax, which was placed before a gentle fire; and as the wax di&s;&s;olved, the king's &s;trength was expected to wa&s;te; and upon its total di&s;&s;olution his life was to be at an end. This accu&s;ation was readily attended to in that credulous age; and the more it de|parted from rea&s;on, the fitter it was for be|coming an object of belief. The pri&s;oners
<PB N="215" REF="217">
were pronounced guilty; neither the rank of the dutche&s;s, nor the innocence of the accu&s;ed, could protect them; &s;he was condemned to do penance, and to &s;uffer perpetual impri&s;onment; Bolingbroke, the prie&s;t, was hanged, and the woman was burnt in Smithfield.</P>
<P>But this was only the beginning of the duke's di&s;tre&s;&s;es. The cardinal of Winche&s;ter was re&s;olved to drive his re&s;entment to the ut|mo&s;t extreme; and accordingly procured a parliament to be &s;ummoned, not at London, which was too well affected to the duke, but at St. Edmund&s;bury, where his adherents were &s;ufficiently numerous to over-awe every opponent. As &s;oon as he appeared, he was accu&s;ed of trea&s;on, and thrown into pri&s;on; and on the day on which he was to make his defence, he was found dead in his bed, though without any &s;igns of violence upon his body.</P>
<P>The death of the duke of Glouce&s;ter was univer&s;ally a&s;cribed to the cardinal of Win|che&s;ter, who him&s;elf died &s;ix weeks after, te&s;ti|fying the utmo&s;t remor&s;e for the bloody &s;cene he had acted. What &s;hare the queen had in the guilt of this tran&s;action is uncertain; her u&s;ual activity and &s;pirit made the public con|clude, with &s;ome rea&s;on, that the duke's ene|mies
<PB N="216" REF="218">
dur&s;t not have ventured on &s;uch a deed without her privity. Henry did not fail to &s;hare in the general di&s;gu&s;t that was thus pro|duced; and as he wanted abilities, he never had the art to remove any &s;u&s;picion. From this time di&s;content began to prevail among the people, and faction among the great. A weak prince &s;eated on the throne of England, however gentle and innocent, &s;eldom fails of having his authority de&s;pi&s;ed, and his power in&s;ulted. The incapacity of Henry began every day to appear in a fuller light; and the foreign war being now extingui&s;hed, the people began to prepare for the horrors of in|te&s;tine &s;trife. In this period of calamity, a new intere&s;t was revived, which had lain dor|mant in the times of pro&s;perity and triumph.</P>
<P>It was now that the Engli&s;h were to pay the &s;evere, though late, penalty for having un|ju&s;tly depo&s;ed Richard the &s;econd; another Richard, who was duke of York, beginning to think of prefering his claims to the crown. This nobleman was de&s;cended, by the mother's &s;ide, from Lionel, one of the &s;ons of Edward the third, whereas the reigning king was de&s;|cended from John of Gaunt, a &s;on of the &s;ame monarch, but younger than Lionel. Richard, therefore, &s;tood plainly in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
<PB N="217" REF="219">
before Henry; and he began to think the weakne&s;s and unpopularity of the pre&s;ent reign a favourable moment for ambition. The en&s;ign of Richard was a white ro&s;e, that of Henry a red; and this gave name to the two factions, who&s;e animo&s;ity was now about to drench the kingdom with &s;laughter.</P>
<P>The cardinal of Winche&s;ter being dead, the duke of Suffolk, who had a hand in Glou|ce&s;ter's a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, took the lead in public affairs; and being &s;ecretly aided by the intere&s;t of the queen, managed all with uncontroulable authority. As this nobleman had made his way to power by murder, &s;o he was re&s;olved to maintain him&s;elf in it by the u&s;ual re&s;ources of bad men, by tyranny over his inferiors, and flattery to the queen. His conduct &s;oon excit|ed the jealou&s;y or the hatred of the whole kingdom. The great nobility could ill brook the exaltation of a &s;ubject above them, who was of a birth inferior to their own. The peo|ple complained of his arbitary mea&s;ures; <MILESTONE N="1450" UNIT="A.D."> and the immen&s;e acqui&s;itions which he had made in office, and the blame of every odious and un&s;ucce&s;sful mea&s;ure, was in&s;tantly given to him. Suffolk was not ignorant of the hatred of the people; but &s;uppo&s;ed that his crimes were &s;uch as could not be proved again&s;t him,
<PB N="218" REF="220">
or, that if proved, he could readily evade pu|ni&s;hment; he endeavoured, therefore, to over|awe his enemies by boldly pre&s;enting him&s;elf to the charge; and he called upon them to &s;hew an in&s;tance of his guilt. This was what the Hou&s;e of Commons had long wi&s;hed for; and they immediately opened their charge a|gain&s;t him of corruption, tyranny, and trea&s;on. He was accu&s;ed of being the cau&s;e of the lo&s;s of France; of per&s;uading the French king, with an armed force, to invade England; and of betraying in office the &s;ecrets of his department. This accu&s;ation might have been fal&s;e; but the real motive, which was Suffolk's power, and the cruel u&s;e he made of it, was left unmentioned, although it was true. It was no ea&s;y matter for any one man's &s;trength, how great &s;oever, to with&s;tand the united re|&s;entment of a nation: &s;o that the court was o|bliged to give up its favourite; and the king, to &s;hield him as much as po&s;&s;ible from popular re&s;entment, bani&s;hed him the kingdom for five years. This was con&s;idered by &s;ome as an e&s;cape from ju&s;tice; the captain of a ve&s;&s;el was therefore employed by his enemies to intercept him in his pa&s;&s;age to France; he was &s;eized near Dover, his head was &s;truck off on the &s;ide of a long-boat; and his body thrown into the &s;ea.
<PB N="219" REF="221">
There is little in the tran&s;actions of the&s;e times to intere&s;t us on the &s;ide of either party; we &s;ee &s;carce any think but crimes on both &s;ides, without one &s;hining character, or one virtue to animate the narrative.</P>
<P>By the death of the duke of Suffolk, Rich|ard of York &s;aw him&s;elf rid of a potent ene|my, and was plea&s;ed to &s;ee the di&s;contents of the nation daily encrea&s;e. Among the number of complaints which the unpopularity of the government gave ri&s;e to, there were &s;ome which even excited in&s;urrection; particu|larly that headed by John Cade, which was of the mo&s;t dangerous nature. This man was a native of Ireland, who had been obliged to fly over into France for his crimes; but &s;eeing the people upon his return prepared for violent mea&s;ures, he a&s;&s;umed the name of Mortimer; and at the head of twenty thou&s;and Kenti&s;h men advanced toward the capital, and encamped at Blackheath. The king being informed of this commotion, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to demand the cau&s;e of their a&s;&s;embling in arms; and Cade, in the name of the community, an&s;wered, that their only aim was to puni&s;h evil mini&s;ters, and procure a redre&s;s of grievan|ces for the people. The king's council deem|ing the&s;e demands &s;editious, a body of fifteen
<PB N="220" REF="222">
thou&s;and men was levied to oppo&s;e the in&s;ur|gents; while Henry him&s;elf marched at their head towards Blackheath. At his approach, Cade retired, as if he had been afraid of an engagement, and lay in ambu&s;h in a wood, not doubting that he &s;hould be pur&s;ued by the king's whole army; but the king was content with &s;ending a detachment after the fugitives, and returning him&s;elf to London. This was what Cade de&s;ired to &s;ee, and &s;allying out from his ambu&s;cade, he cut the detachment in pieces.</P>
<P>The citizens of London &s;oon after opened their gates to the victor; and Cade for &s;ome time maintained great order and di&s;cipline a|mong his followers. He always led them out into the field during the night time; and pub|li&s;hed &s;evere edicts again&s;t plunder, and vio|lence of every kind.</P>
<P>Next day, being informed that the trea&s;urer, lord Say, was in the city, he cau&s;ed him to be apprehended, and beheaded without any form of trial; and in the evening returned to the Borough of Southwark. Thus for &s;ome days he continued the practice of entering the city in the morning, and quitting it at night; but at length being unable to keep his followers within bounds, the citizens re&s;olved to &s;hut
<PB N="221" REF="223">
their gates again&s;t him. Cade endeavouring to force his way, an engagement en&s;ued be|tween him and the citizens, which la&s;ted all day, and was not di&s;continued until night put an end to the engagement. The archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and the chan|cellor, who had taken refuge in the Tower, being informed of the &s;ituation of af|fairs, found means to draw up the &s;ame night an act of amne&s;ty, which was privately di&s;|per&s;ed among the rebels, which had the de&s;ired effect. Cade &s;aw him&s;elf in the morning aban|doned by mo&s;t of his followers, and, retreating to Roche&s;ter, was obliged to fly alone into the Wolds of Kent, where a price being &s;et upon his head by proclamation, he was di&s;co|vered, and &s;lain by one Alexander Eden, who, in recompence for this &s;ervice, was made go|vernor of Dover ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the duke of York &s;ecretly fomented the&s;e di&s;turbances; and, pretending to e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of the people, wrote to the king, advi&s;ing a reformation in the mini&s;try; and the hou&s;e of commons was brought over to &s;econd his reque&s;t. An addre&s;s was pre|&s;ented again&s;t the duke of Somer&s;et, the dutche&s;s of Suffolk, the bi&s;hop of Che&s;ter, Sir John Tufton, and lord Dudley, praying the king
<PB N="222" REF="224">
to remove them for ever from his per&s;on and councils, and to prohibit them from approach|ing within twelve miles of the court. Though the king was willing enough to oppo&s;e &s;o vio|lent and arbitrary an attack upon his favour|ites, yet he endeavoured to &s;often the general animo&s;ity again&s;t them, by promi&s;ing to bani&s;h a part of the obnoxious mini&s;try from court for the &s;pace of a year.</P>
<P>But partial conce&s;&s;ions in government are generally bad palliatives. The duke of York, who found the people entirely attached to him, re&s;olved to avail him&s;elf of his power; and rai&s;ing a body of ten thou&s;and men, marched towards London, demanding a reformation of the government, and the removal of the duke of Somer&s;et from all his power and authority. He had hopes from the beginning that the ci|tizens would have thrown open their gates to him; but was much mortified, when he found that he was refu&s;ed admi&s;&s;ion. Upon his re|treat into Kent, a parley en&s;ued between the king and him, in which the duke &s;till in&s;i&s;ted on the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of Somer&s;et, with which the king &s;eemed at length willing to comply. The duke of York was therefore per&s;uaded to pay his re&s;pects to the king in his tent; but on repeat|ing his charge again&s;t the duke of Somer&s;et,
<PB N="223" REF="225">
he was &s;urprized to &s;ee that mini&s;ter &s;tep from behind the curtain, and offer to ju&s;tify his in|nocence. York now perceived his danger, and repre&s;&s;ed the impetuo&s;ity of his accu&s;ation. As &s;oon as he left the pre&s;ence, the king com|manded him to be apprehended; but &s;uch was this nobleman's authority, or &s;uch the timidity of the king's council, that they &s;uffered him to retire to his &s;eat at Wigmore, upon promi&s;ing &s;trict obedience for the future.</P>
<P>But a reconciliation thus extorted could be of no long duration; York &s;till &s;ecretly a&s;|pired at the crown, and though he wi&s;hed no|thing &s;o ardently, yet he was for &s;ome time pre|vented by his own &s;cruples from &s;eizing it. What his intrigues failed to bring about, ac|cident produced to his de&s;ire. The king fall|ing into a di&s;temper, which &s;o far encrea&s;ed his natural imbecility that it even rendered him incapable of maintaining the appearance of royalty, York was appointed lieutenant and protector of the kingdom, with powers to hold and open parliaments at plea&s;ure. This was a fatal blow to the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter; all the adherents of that party were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from court, and the duke of Somer&s;et was &s;ent to the Tower.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="226">York being thus inve&s;ted with a plenitude of power, continued in the enjoyment of it for &s;ome time; <MILESTONE N="1454" UNIT="A.D."> but at length the unhappy king recovering from his lethargic complaint; and, as if awaking from a dream, perceived with &s;urprize, that he was &s;tripped of all his authority. Margaret, his queen, al&s;o did all in her power to rouze him to a &s;en&s;e of his un|worthy &s;ituation, and prevailed upon him to depo&s;e the duke of York from his power; in con|&s;equence of which, that nobleman had in&s;tant re|cour&s;e to arms. The impotent monarch, thus o|bliged to take the field, was dragged after his ar|my to St. Alban's, where both &s;ides came to an engagement, in which the Yorki&s;ts gained a com|plete victory, and the duke of Somer&s;et was &s;lain. The king him&s;elf being wounded, and taking &s;helter in a cottage, near the field of battle, was taken pri&s;oner, and treated by the victor with great re&s;pect and tenderne&s;s. From thence he was, &s;hortly after, led along in triumph to London; and the duke of York permitting him &s;till to enjoy the title of king, he re&s;erved to him&s;elf the title of protector, in which con|&s;i&s;ted all the real power of the crown.</P>
<P>Henry was now but a pri&s;oner, treated with the &s;plendid forms of royalty; yet indolent and &s;ickly, he &s;eemed plea&s;ed with his &s;itua|tion,
<PB N="225" REF="227">
and did not regret that power which was not to be exerci&s;ed without fatigue. But it was otherwi&s;e with Margaret, his queen. She, naturally bold, active, and endued with ma&s;|culine courage, could not be content with the appearance of that authority, which her enemies alone permitted her to exerci&s;e; &s;he continued to excite the wretched monarch to a vindica|tion of his real dignity, and to &s;pur him on to independence. He was, therefore, once more induced to a&s;&s;ert his prerogative; and the duke of York was obliged to retire, to be in readine&s;s to oppo&s;e any de&s;igns again&s;t his liberty and life. At fir&s;t a negociation for peace was entered upon by both parties; but their mutual di&s;tru&s;ts &s;oon brought them into the field, and the fate of the kingdom was given up to be determined by the &s;word. Their ar|mies met at Bloreheath, on the borders of Stafford&s;hire,<MILESTONE N="Sept. 23. 1459."> and the Yorki&s;ts gained &s;ome advantages. But when a more general action was about to en&s;ue, the night before the in|tended enagement, Sir Andrew Trollop, who commanded a body of veterans for the duke of York, de&s;erted with all his men to the king; and this &s;o intimidated the whole army of the Yorki&s;ts, that they &s;eparated the next day, without &s;triking a &s;ingle blow. The duke of
<PB N="226" REF="228">
York fled to Ireland; the earl of Warwick, one of his bolde&s;t and able&s;t &s;upporters, e&s;caped to Calais, with the government of which he had been entru&s;ted during the late protector&s;hip; and all the party, thus &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, concealed their intentions for a more favourable oppor|tunity. Nor was this opportunity long want|ing; Warwick having met with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;&s;es at &s;ea, landed in Kent, and being there joined by &s;ome other barons, he marched up to Lon|don, amid&s;t the acclamations of the people. The city immediately opened its gates to him; and his troops encrea&s;ing on every day's march, he &s;oon found him&s;elf in a condition to face the royal army, which ha&s;tened from Coventry to attack him. Never was there a more for|midable divi&s;ion of intere&s;ts, or greater inve|teracy between the chiefs of either party than the pre&s;ent. Warwick was one of the mo&s;t ce|lebrated generals of his age, formed for times of trouble, extremely artful, and inconte&s;tably brave, equally &s;kilful in council and the field, and in&s;pired with a degree of hatred again&s;t the queen that nothing could &s;uppre&s;s. On the other &s;ide, the queen &s;eemed the only acting general: &s;he ranged the army in battalia, and gave the nece&s;&s;ary orders, while the poor king was brought forward, an involuntry &s;pectator
<PB N="227" REF="229">
of tho&s;e martial preparations. Both armies met on a plain near Northampton; the queen's forces amounting to about five and twenty thou&s;and men, the earl of Warwick's to near double that number. While the queen went about from rank to rank, the king remained in his tent, awaiting the i&s;&s;ue of the combat with female doubts and apprehen&s;ions. The battle continued for five hours, with the utmo&s;t ob|&s;tinacy; but at length the good fortune and the numbers of Warwick were &s;een to prevail. The queen's army was overthrown; and &s;he had the misfortune to &s;ee the king once more made a pri&s;oner, and brought back to his capital in triumph.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of the Yorki&s;ts being thus con|firmed by the &s;tronge&s;t arguments, tho&s;e of power, a parliament was called to give it their more formal &s;anction. The duke of York, who&s;e pro&s;pects began to widen as he ro&s;e, from being contented with the protector&s;hip, now began to claim the crown. It was now, for the fir&s;t time, that the hou&s;e of lords &s;eemed to enjoy an unbia&s;&s;ed deliberative authority; the cau&s;e of Henry and the duke of York was &s;o|lemnly debated, each &s;ide producing their rea|&s;ons without fear or control. This was the fir&s;t time that a &s;pirit of true rational liberty
<PB N="228" REF="230">
ever appeared to exert it&s;elf in England, and in which recent conque&s;t did not &s;uper&s;ede all deliberation. The duke of York, though a conqueror, could not entirely gain his cau&s;e: it was determined that Henry &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the throne during his life; and that the duke of York &s;hould be appointed his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, to the utter exclu&s;ion of the prince of Wales, who, yet but a child, was in&s;en&s;ible of the in|jury that was done him.</P>
<P>The queen, to all appearance, now &s;eemed utterly de&s;titute of every re&s;ource; her armies were routed, her hu&s;band taken pri&s;oner, and the parliament di&s;claimed her cau&s;e; yet, though &s;he had lo&s;t all, &s;he &s;till retained her native intre|pidity and per&s;everance. She was a woman of a great mind and &s;ome faults, but ambition &s;eemed to be the leading pa&s;&s;ion in all her con|duct. Being now a fugitive, di&s;tant from the capital, oppo&s;ed by a victorious army, and a con&s;ummate general, &s;he &s;till tried every re|&s;ource to repair her di&s;a&s;trous circum&s;tances. She flew to Wales; there endeavoured to ani|mate her old friends, and to acquire new. The nobility of the North, who regarded them&s;elves as the mo&s;t warlike of the kingdom, were moved by indignation to find the &s;outhern ba|rons di&s;po&s;e of the crown, and &s;ettle the govern|ment.
<PB N="229" REF="231">
They began to con&s;ider the royal cau&s;e as unju&s;tly oppre&s;&s;ed; and the queen &s;oon found her&s;elf at the head of an army of twenty thou&s;and men, ready to &s;econd her preten&s;ions. She and her old enemy, the duke of York, once more met upon Wakefield Green,<MILESTONE N="Decem. 24, 1460."> near the ca&s;tle of Sandal; and victory on this occa&s;ion, declared it&s;elf in favour of the queen. The duke of York was killed in the action; and as his body was found among the &s;lain, his head was cut off by Margaret's orders, and fixed on the gates of York, with a paper crown, in deri&s;ion of his pretended title. His &s;on, the earl of Rutland, a youth of &s;eventeen, was taken pri|&s;oner and killed in cold blood, by lord Clifford, in revenge for his father's death, who had fallen in the battle of St. Alban's.</P>
<P>Margaret, being victorious, marched to|wards London in order to give the king li|berty; but the earl of Warwick, who now put him&s;elf at the head of the Yorki&s;ts, com|manded an army, in which he led about the captive king to give a &s;anction to his at|tempts. Upon the approach of the Lanca&s;|trians he conducted his forces, &s;trengthened by a body of Londoners, who were very affectio|nate to his cau&s;e, and he gave battle to the queen at St. Alban's. While the armies were
<PB N="230" REF="232">
warmly engaged, lord Lovelace, who com|manded a con&s;iderable body of Yorki&s;ts trea|cherou&s;ly withdrew from the combat, and this decided the victory in favour of the queen. Above two thou&s;and of the Yorki&s;ts peri&s;hed in the battle, and the per&s;on of the king again fell into the hands of his own party, to be treaty with apparent re&s;pect, but real con|tempt. Lord Bonville, to who&s;e care he had been entru&s;ted, &s;taid with him after the de|feat, upon an a&s;&s;urance of pardon; but Mar|garet, regardle&s;s of her hu&s;band's promi&s;e, immediately ordered his head to be &s;truck off.</P>
<P>It only now remained, that the city of Lon|don &s;hould declare in the queen's favour, but Warwick had previou&s;ly &s;ecured it in his in|tere&s;ts; and the citizens, who dreaded her tu|multuous army, refu&s;ed to open their gates to her &s;ummons. In the mean time, young Ed|ward, the elde&s;t &s;on of the late duke of York, began to repair the lo&s;&s;es his party had lately &s;u&s;tained, and to give &s;pirit to the Yorki&s;ts. This prince, in the bloom of youth, remarkable for the beauty of his per&s;on, his bravery, and popular deportment, advan|ced towards London with the remainder of Warwick's army; and obliging Margaret to
<PB N="231" REF="233">
retire, entered the city amid&s;t the acclamations of the people. Perceiving his own popularity,<MILESTONE N="1461" UNIT="A.D."> he &s;uppo&s;ed that now was the time to lay his claim to the crown; and his friend Warwick, a&s;&s;embling the citizens in St. John's fields, pro|nounced an harrangue, &s;etting forth the title of Edward, and inveighing again&s;t the tyranny and u&s;urpation of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter. He then demanded whether they cho&s;e Henry for their king; to which the people crying, a York! a York! he quickly called an a&s;&s;embly of lords and bi&s;hops, at Baynard's ca&s;tle, and the&s;e ratified their choice. The young duke was proclaimed king, by the title of Ed|ward IV. and then conducted with great ce|remony to the palace, where Henry u&s;ed to lodge when within the walls of the city.</P>
<P>But the mi&s;eries of a civil war were not yet completed, and Margaret was re&s;olved to &s;trike another blow. Upon her retiring to the North, great numbers flocked to her &s;tandard, and &s;he was able, in a few days, to a&s;&s;emble an army of &s;ixty thou&s;and men in York&s;hire. On the other &s;ide, the earl of Warwick conducted young Edward at the head of forty thou&s;and men to oppo&s;e her. Both &s;ides at length met near Touton, in the county of York, to decide the fate of empire, and never was England
<PB N="232" REF="234">
depopulated by &s;o terrible an engagement. It was a dreadful &s;ight, to behold an hundred thou|&s;and men of the &s;ame country engaged again&s;t each other; and all to &s;atisfy the empty am|bition of the weake&s;t, or the wor&s;t of mankind. While the army of Edward was advancing to the charge, there happened a great fall of &s;now; which driving full in the faces of the enemy blind|ed them, and this advantage, &s;econded by an im|petuous on&s;et, decided the victory in their favour. Edward i&s;&s;ued orders to give no quarter; and a bloody &s;laughter en&s;ued, in which near forty thou&s;and of the Lanca&s;trians were &s;lain. Ed|ward entered York victorious; and taking down the heads of his father and the earl of Sali&s;bury, that were placed over the city gates, put up that of the earl of Devon&s;hire in their &s;tead.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Margaret hearing the fate of her army, and being &s;en&s;ible that no place in England could now afford her pro|tection, &s;he fled with Henry and her &s;on to Scotland. But no calamity was able to re|pre&s;s her per&s;everance; though &s;o often over|come, yet &s;he was re&s;olved once more to en|ter England with five thou&s;and men, granted her by the French king; and the unfortunate Henry was led onward, by his pre&s;ence to en|force
<PB N="233" REF="235">
her claims. But even here her former ill fortune attended her; and her little fleet was di&s;per&s;ed by a tempe&s;t, while &s;he her&s;elf e&s;caped, with &s;ome difficulty, by entering the mouth of the Tweed. Soon after a defeat, which her few forces &s;uffered at Hexham, &s;eemed to render her cau&s;e de&s;perate; and the cruelty which was practi&s;ed upon all her adhe|rents, rendered it &s;till more dangerous.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of this battle appeared to deprive her of every re&s;ource; &s;he and her hu&s;band were obliged to &s;eek for &s;afety in a &s;eparate flight, without attendants, and without even the nece&s;&s;aries of life. The weak unfortunate king, always imprudent, and always un&s;ucce&s;s|ful, thought he could remain concealed in England; but his error was &s;oon attended with the obvious con&s;equences, being taken pri&s;oner, carried to London with ignominy, and confined in the Tower. Margaret was ra|ther more fortunate. She flying with her &s;on into a fore&s;t, where &s;he endeavoured to con|ceal her&s;elf, was &s;et upon during the darkne&s;s of the night by robbers, who, either ignorant or regardle&s;s of her quality, de&s;poiled her of her rings and jewels, and treated her with the utmo&s;t indignity. But &s;he found more re&s;pect|ful treatment from one of tho&s;e lawle&s;s men,
<PB N="234" REF="236">
who, knowing her &s;tation, re&s;olved to procure her &s;afety at the hazard of his own; and at la&s;t conducted her to the &s;ea-coa&s;t, whence &s;he made her e&s;cape to her father in Flanders, who, though very poor, &s;trove as well as he could to &s;upply her with the nece&s;&s;aries of life. To the &s;ame court the dukes of Somer|&s;et and Exeter retired; and they, literally &s;peaking, felt all the mi&s;eries of want. Philip de Comines, the French hi&s;torian, &s;ays he &s;aw the duke of Exeter following the duke of Burgundy's equipage bare-footed, and &s;erving for his livelihood as a footman. This was a &s;trange &s;ituation for a lord, who had conducted armies, and was allied to kings and princes; but tho&s;e enjoyments which &s;erved to di&s;tin|gui&s;h the great from the little, were not &s;o ap|parent then as at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Edward being now, by means of the earl of Warwick, fixed upon the throne, reigned in peace and &s;ecurity, while his title was recogniz|ed by parliament, and univer&s;ally &s;ubmitted to by the people.<MILESTONE N="1464" UNIT="A.D."> He, began therefore, to give a loo&s;e to his favourite pa&s;&s;ions; and a &s;pirit of gallantry, mixed with cruelty, was &s;een to prevail in his court. In the very &s;ame pa|lace, which one day exhibited a &s;pectacle of horror, was to be &s;een the day following a
<PB N="235" REF="237">
ma&s;k or a pageant; and the king would at once gallant a mi&s;tre&s;s, and in&s;pect an execution. In order to turn him from the&s;e pur&s;uits, which were calculated to render him unpopular, the earl of Warwick advi&s;ed him to marry; and, with his con&s;ent, went over to France to pro|cure Bona of Savoy as queen, and the match was accordingly concluded. But whil&s;t the earl was ha&s;tening the negotiation in France, the king him&s;elf rendered it abortive at home, by marrying Elizabeth Woodville, with whom he had fallen in love, and whom he had vainly endeavoured to debauch. Having thus given Warwick real cau&s;e of offence, he was re&s;olved to widen the breach, by driving him from the council. Every incident tended to encrea&s;e the jealou&s;y between the king, and this powerful &s;ubject; the favour &s;hewn the queen's party, and the contempt which was thrown upon the earl, manife&s;ted an open rapture. Warwick, who&s;e prudence was equal to his bravery, &s;oon made u&s;e of both to a&s;&s;i&s;t his revenge; he &s;educed the duke of Clarence, brother to the king; and to confirm that nobleman in his intere&s;ts, he gave him his daughter in marriage. Thus an ex|ten&s;ive and dangerous combination was formed again&s;t Edward and his mini&s;try; and an ac|cident that followed &s;oon after, contributed to
<PB N="236" REF="238">
fan the flame. The inhabitants about St. Leonard's Ho&s;pital, in York&s;hire, complained that the duties levied for that in&s;titution, which were originally allotted for pious u&s;es, were now &s;ecreted by the managers; and they refu&s;ed to contribute their pair. They &s;oon after ro&s;e in a body to oppo&s;e the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;everities that were levelled again&s;t them by the earl of Pembroke. It is thought that the earl of Warwick had &s;ome hand in fomenting the&s;e di&s;orders; and although this rebellion was quieted by a pardon from Edward, yet &s;ome others, that broke out &s;hortly after, ap|peared favourable to Warwick's de&s;igns. Ven|geance &s;eemed to be the only motive this no|bleman had in view; and that he pur&s;ued with unabating a&s;&s;iduity. Plots, trea&s;ons, &s;trata|gems, and negotiations, followed each other in rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; but at la&s;t fortune &s;eemed to favour Warwick's aims; and the king, as we are told, fell into his power, by accepting an invitation, which the earl gave him, in or|der to betray him. Be this as it may, Ed|ward had &s;oon the good fortune to &s;ee him|&s;elf at the head of a numerous army, and in a condition to take &s;atisfaction for the treachery of his powerful opponent. Re&s;olving there|fore to take advantage of the enemies weak|ne&s;s,
<PB N="237" REF="239">
after having defeated a party command|ed by lord Wells, and cut off his head, he marched to give them battle. In this exi|gence, Warwick, and the duke of Clarence, had no other re&s;ource but to quit the king|dom; and embarking for Calais, they &s;eized upon &s;ome Flemi&s;h ve&s;&s;els, which they found lying along that coa&s;t, with which they entered one of the ports of France. Here they entered into an union with Margaret, which was dictat|ed by nece&s;&s;ity; both &s;ides being willing to forget their mutual animo&s;ity, in order to &s;econd their revenge. Lewis, the king of France, prepared a fleet to e&s;cort them; and &s;eizing the opportunity, they landed at Dart|mouth with a &s;mall body of troops, while Ed|ward was in the North, &s;uppre&s;&s;ing an in&s;urrec|tion, which had lately appeared there. No|thing can be more extraordinary than the &s;uc|ce&s;s of Warwick upon this occa&s;ion. The &s;pi|rit of di&s;content with which many were infect|ed, and the general in&s;tability of the Engli&s;h nation, con&s;pired with his ambition; and in le&s;s than &s;ix days &s;uch multitudes flocked to his &s;tandard, that he &s;aw him&s;elf at the head of an army of three&s;core thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>It was now become Edward's turn to fly the kingdom. He had ju&s;t time to e&s;cape an at|tempt
<PB N="238" REF="240">
made upon his per&s;on in the night, by the marquis of Montague; and to embark on board a &s;mall fleet, which lay off Lynn in Norfolk. Nor were his dangers le&s;&s;ened at &s;ea, where he was cha&s;ed by &s;ome &s;hips belong|ing to the Han&s;e-towns, who were then at war with both France and England. But at length he landed &s;afely in Holland, where he received a cool reception from the duke of Burgundy, with whom he had &s;ome time before entered into an alliance.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1470" UNIT="A.D."> In the mean time, Warwick, with his re&s;i&s;t|le&s;s army, advanced to London; and once more the poor pa&s;&s;ive king Henry was relea&s;ed from pri&s;on to be placed upon a dangerous throne. A parliament was called, which confirmed Henry's title with great &s;olemnity; and Warwick was him&s;elf received among the people under the title of the King-maker. All the attainders of the Lanca&s;trians were rever&s;|ed; and every one was re&s;tored, who had lo&s;t either honours or fortune by his former adhe|rence to Henry's cau&s;e. All the con&s;ider|able Yorki&s;ts either fled to the continent, or took &s;helter in &s;anctuaries, where the eccle|&s;ia&s;tical privileges afforded them protection.</P>
<P>But Edward's party, though repre&s;&s;ed, was not de&s;troyed. Though an exile in Holland,
<PB N="239" REF="241">
he had many partizans at home; and after an ab&s;ence of nine months, being &s;econded by a &s;mall body of forces, granted him by the duke of Burgundy, he made a de&s;cent at Raven|&s;pur in York&s;hire. Though at fir&s;t he was cooly received by the Engli&s;h, yet his army encrea&s;ed upon its march, while his moderation and feigned humility &s;till added to the number of his partizans. London at that time ever ready to admit the mo&s;t powerful, opened her gates to him; and the wretched Henry was once more plucked from his throne, to be &s;ent back to his former man&s;ion.</P>
<P>Thus Warwick began to experience the in&s;tability of fortune, and find his party de|clining; but what gave the mo&s;t dreadful blow to his hopes was the defection of his &s;on-in-law, the duke of Clarence, who went over to Edward, and threw all his weight into the oppo&s;ite &s;cale. Nothing now therefore re|mained to Warwick, but to cut &s;hort a &s;tate of anxious &s;u&s;pen&s;e by hazarding a battle; and though he knew his forces to be inferior to tho&s;e of Edward, yet he placed his greate&s;t dependence upon his own general&s;hip. With this re&s;olution, therefore, he marched from St. Alban's, where he was &s;tationed, and advan|cing towards Barnet, within ten miles of Lon|don,
<PB N="240" REF="242">
there re&s;olved to wait for Edward, who was not flow in marching down to oppo&s;e him. Warwick and Edward were at that time con|&s;idered as the two mo&s;t renowned generals of the age; and now was to be &s;truck the deci|&s;ive blow that was either to &s;ix Edward on the throne, or to overthrow his preten&s;ions for ever. The unfortunate Henry al&s;o was dragged along to be a &s;pectator of the engagement; happy in his natural imbecillity, which &s;eem|ed as a balm to &s;ooth all his afflictions.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1471. April 14." UNIT="A.D."> The battle began early in the morning, and la&s;ted till noon; for never did two armies fight with greater ob&s;tinacy and bravery, not ho|nour, but life, depending on the i&s;&s;ue of the conte&s;t. The example of Warwick in&s;pired his troops with more than common re&s;olution, and the victory for a while &s;eemed to declare in his favour. But an accident at la&s;t threw the balance again&s;t him; from the mi&s;tine&s;s of the morning, a part of his army happening to mi&s;take a body of their own forces for that of the enemy, fell furiou&s;ly upon them; and this error turned the fortune of the day. Warwick did all that experience, valour, or conduct could &s;ugge&s;t, to retrieve the mi&s;|take; but it was now too late; no art could cover the former error: wherefore, finding all
<PB N="241" REF="243">
hopes gone, he was re&s;olved to &s;ell the con|querors a dear-bought victory. He had, con|trary to his u&s;ual practice, engaged that day on foot; and leading a cho&s;en body of troops into the thicke&s;t of the &s;laughter, he there fell in the mid&s;t of his enemies, covered over with wounds. His brother underwent the &s;ame fate; and ten thou&s;and of his adherents were &s;lain, Edward having ordered that no quarter &s;hould be given.</P>
<P>Margaret, who had been ever fruitful in re|&s;ources, was at that time returning from France with her &s;on, the prince of Wales, where &s;he had been negotiating for fre&s;h &s;upplies. She had &s;carce time to refre&s;h her&s;elf from the fatigues of her voyage, when &s;he received the fatal news of the death of the brave War|wick, and the total de&s;truction of her party. Though &s;he had hitherto boldly with&s;tood all the attacks of fortune, the pre&s;ent informa|tion was too violent a blow for nature to &s;up|port. Her grief, for the fir&s;t time, found way in a torrent of tears; and yielding to her unhappy fate, &s;he took &s;anctuary in the abbey of Beaulieu in Hamp&s;hire.</P>
<P>She had not been long in this melancholy abode before &s;he found &s;ome few friends &s;till willing to a&s;&s;i&s;t her fallen fortunes. Tudor,
<PB N="242" REF="244">
earl of Pembroke, Courtney, earl of Devon|&s;hire, the lords Wenlock and St. John, with other men of rank, exhorted her &s;till to hope for &s;ucce&s;s, and offered to a&s;&s;i&s;t her to the la&s;t. A dawn of hope was &s;ufficient to revive the cou|rage of this magnanimous woman; and the recollection of her former misfortunes gave way to the flattering pro&s;pect of another trial. She had now fought battles in almo&s;t every province in England; Tewk&s;bury-Park was the la&s;t &s;cene that terminated her attempts. The duke of Somer&s;et headed her army; a man who had &s;hared her dangers, and had ever been &s;teady in her cau&s;e. He was va|liant, generous, and polite; but ra&s;h, and head&s;trong. When Edward fir&s;t attacked him in his intrenchments, he repul&s;ed him with &s;uch vigour, that the enemy retired with pre|cipitation; upon which the duke, &s;uppo&s;ing them routed, pur&s;ued, and ordered lord Wen|lock to &s;upport his charge. But unfortunately this lord di&s;obeyed his orders; and Somer&s;et's forces were &s;oon overpowered by numbers. In this dreadful exigence, the duke, finding that all was over, became ungovernable in his rage; and beholding Wenlock inactive, and remain|ing in the very place where he had fir&s;t drawn up his men, giving way to his fury, with his
<PB N="243" REF="245">
heavy battle-ax in both hands, he ran upon the coward, and with one blow da&s;hed out his brains.</P>
<P>The queen and the prince were taken pri&s;oners after the battle, and brought into the pre&s;ence of Edward. The young prince appeared before the conqueror with undaunted maje&s;ty; and being a&s;ked, in an in&s;ulting manner, how he dared to invade England without leave, the young prince, more mindful of his high birth than of his ruined fortune, replied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have en|tered the dominions of my father, to revenge his injuries, and redre&s;s my own."</Q> The barbarous Edward, enraged at his intrepidity, &s;truck him on the mouth with his gauntlet; and this &s;erved as a &s;ignal for further brutality: the dukes of Glouce&s;ter, Clarence, and others, like wild bea&s;ts, ru&s;hing on the unarmed youth at once, &s;tabbed him to the heart with their daggers. To complete the tragedy, Henry him&s;elf, who had long been the pa&s;&s;ive &s;pectator of all the&s;e horrors, was now thought unfit to live. The duke of Glouce&s;ter, after|wards Richard the third, entering his cham|ber alone, murdered him in cold blood. Of all tho&s;e that were taken, none were &s;uffered to &s;urvive but Margaret her&s;elf. It was per|haps expected that &s;he would be ran&s;omed by
<PB N="244" REF="246">
the king of France; and in this they were not deceived, as that monarch paid the king of England fifty thou&s;and crowns for her free|dom. This extraordinary woman, after hav|ing &s;u&s;tained the cau&s;e of her hu&s;band in twelve battles, after having &s;urvived her friends, fortunes, and children, died a few years after in privacy in France, very mi&s;erable indeed; but with few other claims to our pity, except her courage and her di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>

<P>OF all people the Engli&s;h are the mo&s;t truly compa&s;&s;ionate; and a throne rai&s;ed upon cruelty never wanted enemies among them. No|thing could have been more ill-judged than any attempts to govern &s;uch a people by the hands of the executioner; and the leaders of either faction &s;eemed in&s;en&s;ible of this truth. Ed|ward being now freed from great enemies,
<PB N="246" REF="248">
turned to the puni&s;hment of tho&s;e of le&s;&s;er note; &s;o that the gibbets were hung with his adver&s;aries, and their e&s;tates confi&s;cated to his u&s;e. The ba&s;tard Falconbridge, among others, having advanced to London at the head of a &s;mall body of forces, was repul&s;ed; and being taken pri&s;oner was immediately executed.</P>
<P>But while Edward was thus rendering him|&s;elf terrible on the one hand, he was immer&s;ed in abandoned plea&s;ures on the other. Nature, it &s;eems, was not unfavourable to him in that re&s;pect; as he was univer&s;ally allowed to be the mo&s;t beautiful man of his time. His cour|tiers al&s;o &s;eemed willing to encourage tho&s;e de|baucheries in which they had a &s;hare; and the clergy, as they them&s;elves practi&s;ed every kind of lewdne&s;s with impunity, were ever ready to lend ab&s;olution to all his failings. The truth is, enormous vices had been of late &s;o common, that adultery was held but as a very &s;light offence. Among the number of his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es was the wife of one Shore, a merchant in the city, a woman of exqui&s;ite beauty and good &s;en&s;e, but who had not vir|tue enough to re&s;i&s;t the temptations of a beau|tiful man, and a monarch.</P>
<P>England now enjoying a temporary calm, Edward thought that the be&s;t way to ingratiate
<PB N="247" REF="249">
him&s;elf with his &s;ubjects, would be to a&s;&s;ert his right to his dominions in France, which the in&s;urrections of his father had contributed to alienate during the former reign. An at|tempt of this kind would &s;erve to give vent to the malignant di&s;po&s;ition of his enemies, and would be &s;ure to plea&s;e the vulgar, who are ever more fond of &s;plendid, than of u&s;eful acqui&s;itions. To pro&s;ecute this &s;cheme, the king &s;ent off to his ally, the duke of Bur|gundy, a reinforcement of three thou&s;and men, and &s;oon after pa&s;&s;ed over him&s;elf at the head of a numerous army. Lewis the eleventh, who was then king of France, was, not with|out rea&s;on, alarmed at this formidable inva|&s;ion, which as he was unable to re&s;i&s;t, he &s;trove to obviate by treaty. This &s;ucceeded more effectually than arms; the two kings had an interview at the bridge of Perpignan; and, upon the promi&s;e of a &s;tipulated &s;um, Edward agreed to lead his forces back to England. This monarch wanted to return home to his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es to &s;pend upon them the money he ex|pected to receive from France; and the French monarch hoped &s;oon to put him&s;elf in a po&s;|ture to refu&s;e giving the&s;e &s;ums which he had only made a promi&s;e to pay.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="250">Upon the conclu&s;ion of this expedition, which thus ended without effect, Edward ap|peared no le&s;s actuated by private pa&s;&s;ions un|worthy a &s;overeign and a &s;tate&s;man, than jea|lous of all who &s;eemed to de&s;pi&s;e his conduct. Among the detail of private wrongs, which are too minute for hi&s;tory, an act of tyranny, of which he was guilty in his own family, de|&s;erves the dete&s;tation of po&s;terity. The duke of Clarence, by all his &s;ervices in de&s;erting Warwick, had never been able to recover the king's friend&s;hip, which he had forfeited by his former confederacy with that nobleman. A pretext was therefore &s;ought to ruin him; and the openne&s;s of his ha&s;ty temper &s;oon gave the wi&s;hed-for occa&s;ion. The king hunting one day in the park of Thomas Burdet, a creature of the duke's, he killed a white buck, which was a great favourite of the owner. Burdet vexed at the lo&s;s, broke into a pa&s;&s;ion, and wi&s;hed the horns of the deer in the belly of the per&s;on who had advi&s;ed the king to that in&s;ult. For this trifling exclamation, Bur|det was tried for his life, and publicly exe|cuted at Tyburn. The duke of Clarence, upon the death of his friend, vented his grief in renewed reproaches again&s;t his brother, and exclaimed again&s;t the iniquity of the &s;entence.
<PB N="249" REF="251">
The king, highly offended with this liberty, or u&s;ing that as a pretext again&s;t him, had him arraigned before the hou&s;e of peers, and ap|peared in per&s;on as his accu&s;er. In tho&s;e times of confu&s;ion, every crime alledged by the pre|vailing party was fatal; the duke was found guilty; and being granted a choice of the manner in which he would die, he was pri|vately drowned in a butt of malm&s;ey in the Tower; a whim&s;ical choice, and implying that he had an extraordinary pa&s;&s;ion for that liquor.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of this monarch's life was &s;pent in riot and debauchery; in gratifications that are plea&s;ing only to the narrow mind, in u&s;ele&s;s treaties with France, in which he was ever de|ceived, and in empty threats again&s;t the mo|narch who had deceived him.

The people &s;eemed equally plea&s;|&s;ed with the pro&s;pect of an expedition, which, without &s;erving, could only tend to impove|ri&s;h the nation; and great hopes were revived of once more conquering France.

</FIGURE>CHAP. XX. EDWARD V.</HEAD>
<P>UPON the death of Edward, the king|dom was divided into two new factions. The queen's family, who, during the la&s;t reign had grown into power, was became obnoxious to the old nobility, who could not bear to act in &s;ubordination to per&s;ons whom they con&s;idered as inferiors. The king him&s;elf, during his life-time, had been able to over-awe the&s;e animo|&s;ities;
<PB N="252" REF="254">
and on his death-bed endeavoured to guard again&s;t their future encrea&s;e. He ex|pre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire, that his brother the duke of Glouce&s;ter &s;hould be intru&s;ted with the regen|cy, and recommended peace and unanimity during the minority of his &s;on. But the king was no &s;ooner dead, than the parties broke out with all their former re&s;entment; and the duke of Glouce&s;ter, a crafty, wicked, and ambiti|ous prince, re&s;olved to profit by their mu|tual contentions.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t aim was to foment the di&s;contents of the old nobility, by in&s;inuating, that the queen wanted to hide the meanne&s;s of her ori|ginal in a multitude of new promotions; at the &s;ame time he redoubled his profe&s;&s;ions of zeal and attachment to that prince&s;s, and thus en|tirely gained her confidence. Having &s;ucceed|ed thus far, he gained over the duke of Buck|ingham, and &s;ome other lords, to his intere&s;ts, and prevailed upon them to &s;econd him in his attempts to get the guardian&s;hip of the young king conferred upon him, together with the cu&s;tody of his per&s;on.</P>
<P>Being &s;ure of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the&s;e noble|men, he re&s;olved to take the king out of the cu&s;tody of the earl of Rivers, his uncle by the mother's &s;ide; and having procured that
<PB N="253" REF="255">
nobleman to be arre&s;ted, he met young Edward in per&s;on, and offered to conduct him up to London, with the mo&s;t profound demon&s;tra|tions of re&s;pect. Having thus &s;ecured the per|&s;on of the king, his next &s;tep was to get the charge of the king's brother, a boy of about &s;e|ven years old, who, with the queen, his mother, had taken &s;anctuary in We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey. The queen, who had fore&s;een from the begin|ning the dangers that threatened her family, was very hardly per&s;uaded to deliver up her child; but at the interce&s;&s;ion of the primate, and the archbi&s;hop of York, &s;he was at la&s;t induced to comply; and cla&s;ping her child in her arms, with a la&s;t embrace, took leave of him with a &s;hower of tears. The young king finding that he was to have the plea&s;ure of his brother's company, was greatly rejoiced at the queen's compliance, not con&s;idering the fatal intent of the&s;e preparations; for in a few days after the duke of Glouce&s;ter, who had been made protector of the realm, upon a pretence of guarding their per&s;ons from danger, con|veyed them both to the Tower.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;ecured the per&s;ons of tho&s;e he intended to de&s;troy, his next &s;tep was to &s;pread a report of their illegitimacy; and, by pretend|ed ob&s;tacles, to put off the day appointed for
<PB N="254" REF="256">
the young king's coronation. Lord Stanly, a man of deep penetration, was the fir&s;t to di&s;|clo&s;e his fears of the protector's having ill de|&s;igns; and communicated his &s;u&s;picions to lord Ha&s;tings, who long had been firmly attached to the king's family. Ha&s;tings would at fir&s;t give the &s;urmi&s;e no credit; and probably his wi&s;hes that &s;uch a project might not be true, influenced his judgment, and confirmed his &s;ecurity. But he was &s;oon undeceived; for Cate&s;by, a vile in&s;trument of the protector, was &s;ent to &s;ound him, and to try whether he could not be brought over to a&s;&s;i&s;t the projected u&s;ur|pation. Ha&s;tings treated the propo&s;al with horror; he profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf immoveable in his adherence to the king; and his death was therefore re&s;olved on by the protector.</P>
<P>In the mean time, orders had been di&s;|patched to execute the lords Rivers, Gray, and Vaughan, who had been confined in Pom|fret ca&s;tle, and who&s;e only crime was their at|tachment to the young king. On the very day on which they were beheaded, the protector &s;ummoned a council in the Tower, whither lord Ha&s;tings, among&s;t others, repaired, no way &s;u&s;pecting that his own life was in dan|ger. The duke of Glouce&s;ter was capable of committing the mo&s;t bloody and treacherous
<PB N="255" REF="257">
murders with the utmo&s;t coolne&s;s and indif|ference. He came thither at nine o'clock in the morning with a mo&s;t chearful countenance, &s;aluting the members with the utmo&s;t affabili|ty, and demon&s;trations of unu&s;ual good hu|mour. He complimented the bi&s;hop of Ely on his early &s;trawberries, and begged to have a di&s;h of them. He then left the council, as if called away by other bu&s;ine&s;s; but de&s;ired that his ab&s;ence might not interrupt the de|bates. In about an hour he returned, quite altered in look, knitting his brows, biting his lips, and &s;hewing, by a frequent change of countenance, the &s;igns of &s;ome inward pertur|bation. A &s;ilence en&s;ued for &s;ome time; and the lords looked upon each other, not without rea&s;on, expecting &s;ome horrid cata&s;trophe. At length, he broke the dreadful &s;ilence: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My lords, cried he, what puni&s;hment do they de&s;erve, who have con&s;pired again&s;t my life?"</Q> This que&s;tion redoubled the a&s;to|ni&s;hment of the a&s;&s;embly; and the &s;ilence con|tinuing, lord Ha&s;tings at length made an&s;wer, that whoever did &s;o, de&s;erved to be puni&s;hed as a traitor. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The&s;e traitors, cried the pro|tector, are the &s;orcere&s;s, my brother's wife, and Jane Shore, his mi&s;tre&s;s, with others, their a&s;&s;ociates. See to what a condition
<PB N="256" REF="258">
they have reduced me by their incantations and witchcrafts."</Q> Upon which he laid bare his arm, all &s;hrivelled and decayed. The amazement of the council &s;eemed to encrea&s;e at this terrible accu&s;ation; and lord Ha&s;tings again &s;aid: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If they have committed &s;uch a crime, they de&s;erve puni&s;hment."</Q><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If! cried the protector, with a loud voice, do&s;t thou an&s;wer me with Ifs? I tell thee that they have con&s;pired my death; and that thou, traitor, art an accomplice in their crime."</Q> He then &s;truck the table twice with his hand; and the room was in&s;tantly filled with armed men. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I arre&s;t thee, continues he, turning to Ha&s;tings, for high trea&s;on;"</Q> and at the &s;ame time gave him in charge to the &s;oldiers. In the mean while, the council-room was filled with tumult and confu&s;ion; and though no re&s;cue was offered, yet the &s;oldiers cau&s;ed a bu&s;tle, as if they apprehended danger. One of them narrowly mi&s;&s;ed cleaving lord Stanly's head with a battle-ax; but he fortunately e&s;|caped, by &s;hrinking under the table. In all probability the fellow had orders for that at|tempt, and &s;hould Stanley be killed his death might be a&s;cribed to the tumult cau&s;ed by an intended re&s;cue. However, though he e&s;cap|ed the blow he was arre&s;ted by the protec|tor's
<PB N="257" REF="259">
order, who was well apprized of his at|tachment to the young king. As for lord Ha&s;tings, he was obliged to make a &s;hort con|fe&s;&s;ion to the next prie&s;t that was at hand; the protector crying out, By St. Paul, that he would not dine till he had &s;een his head taken off. He was accordingly hurried out to the Little Green before the Tower-chapel, and there be|headed on a log of wood, that accidentally lay in the way. Two hours after, a proclamation, very well drawn up, was read to the citizens of London, enumerating his offences, and pal|liating the &s;uddenne&s;s of his puni&s;hment. It was remarked, however, by a merchant a|mong the auditors, that the proclamation was certainly drawn up by a &s;pirit of prophecy.</P>
<P>The protector, having thus got rid of tho&s;e he mo&s;t feared, was willing to plea&s;e the popu|lace by puni&s;hing Jane Shore, the late king's mi&s;tre&s;s. This unfortunate woman was an enemy too humble to excite his jealou&s;y; yet as he had accu&s;ed her of witchcraft, of which all the world &s;aw &s;he was innocent, he thought proper to make her an example, for tho&s;e faults of which &s;he was really guilty. Jane Shore had been formerly deluded from her hu&s;band, who was a gold&s;mith in Lom|bard Street, and continued to live with Ed|ward,
<PB N="258" REF="260">
the mo&s;t guiltle&s;s mi&s;tre&s;s in his abandon|ed court. She was ever known to intercede for the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and was u&s;ually applied to as me|diator for mercy. She was charitable, generous, and of a mo&s;t plea&s;ing conver&s;ation; her wit being &s;aid to be as irre&s;i&s;tible as her beauty. As &s;he was blamele&s;s in other re&s;pects, the pro|tector ordered her to be &s;ued for incontinency, as having left her hu&s;band to live in adultery with another. It is very probable, that the people were not di&s;plea&s;ed at &s;eeing one again reduced to former meanne&s;s, who had for a while been rai&s;ed above them, and enjoyed the &s;miles of a court. The charge again&s;t her was too notorious to be denied; &s;he pleaded guilty, and was accordingly condemned to walk bare-foot through the city, and to do pe|nance in St. Paul's church in a white &s;heet, with a wax-taper in her hand, before thou&s;ands of &s;pectators. She lived above forty years af|ter this &s;entence, reduced to the mo&s;t extreme wretchedne&s;s; and Sir Thomas More, in the &s;ucceeding reign, a&s;&s;ures us, that he &s;aw her ga|thering herbs in a field near the city for her nightly repa&s;t; an extraordinary example of the ingratitude of courts, and the rever&s;es of fortune.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="261">The protector now began to throw off the ma&s;k, and to deny his pretended regard for the &s;ons of the late king, thinking it high time to a&s;pire at the throne more openly. He had previou&s;ly gained over the duke of Bucking|ham, a man of talents and power, by bribes and promi&s;es of future favour. This noble|man, therefore, u&s;ed all his arts to infu&s;e into the people an opinion of the ba&s;tardy of the late king, and al&s;o that of his children. Doc|tor Shaw, a popular preacher, was hired to harangue the people from St. Paul's Cro&s;s to the &s;ame purpo&s;e; where, after having di&s;play|ed the incontinence of the queen, and in&s;i&s;ting on the illegality of the young king's title, he then expatiated on the virtues of the protector. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is the protector, cried he, who carries in his face the image of virtue, and the marks of a true de&s;cent. He alone can re&s;tore the lo&s;t glory and honour of the nation."</Q> It was hoped, upon this occa&s;ion, that &s;ome of the po|pulace would have cried out, Long live king Richard! but the audience remaining &s;ilent, the duke of Buckingham undertook to per|&s;uade them, in his turn. His &s;peech was copious upon the calamities of the la&s;t reign, and the ba&s;tardy of the pre&s;ent race; he &s;aw only one method of &s;hielding off the mi&s;eries that threat|ened
<PB N="260" REF="262">
the &s;tate, which was, to elect the protect|or; but he &s;eemed apprehen&s;ive that he would never be prevailed on to accept of a crown, ac|companied with &s;uch difficulty and danger. He next a&s;ked his auditors, whether they would have the protector for their king; but was mortified to find that a total &s;ilence en&s;ued. The mayor, who was in the &s;ecret, willing to relieve him in this embarra&s;&s;ing &s;ituation, ob&s;erved, that the citizens were not accu&s;tomed to be harrangued by a per&s;on of &s;uch quality, and would only give an an&s;wer to their recorder. This officer, therefore, repeated the duke's &s;peech, but the people continuing &s;till &s;ilent, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This is &s;trange ob&s;tinacy, cried the duke; we only require of you, in plain terms, to declare whether, or not, you will have the duke of Glouce&s;ter for your king; as the lords and commons have &s;ufficient power without your concurrence?"</Q> After all the&s;e efforts, &s;ome of the meane&s;t apprentices, in|cited by the protector's and Buckingham's &s;er|vants, rai&s;ing a feeble cry of, <Q REND="inline">"God &s;ave king Richard!"</Q> the mob at the door, a de&s;picable cla&s;s of people, ever plea&s;ed with novelty, re|peated the cry, and, throwing up their caps, repeated, A Richard! a Richard!</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="263">In this manner the duke took the advan|tage of this faint approbation; and the next day, at the head of the mayor and aldermen, went to wait upon the protector, at Baynard's Ca&s;tle, with offers of the crown. When Ri|chard was told that a great multitude was wait|ing at the door, with his u&s;ual hypocri&s;y he appeared to the crowd in a gallery between two bi&s;hops, and at fir&s;t &s;eemed quite &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;uch a concour&s;e of people. But when he was informed that their bu&s;ine&s;s was to offer him the crown, he declared again&s;t accepting it; al|ledging his love for the late king, his brother, his affliction for the children under his care, and his own in&s;ufficiency. Buckingham &s;eeming di&s;plea&s;ed with this an&s;wer, muttered &s;ome words to him&s;elf, but at length plainly told him, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That it was needle&s;s to refu&s;e, for that the people were bent on making him king; that they had now proceeded too far to re|cede; and therefore, in ca&s;e of his refu&s;al, were determined to offer the crown where it would meet a more ready acceptance."</Q> This was a re&s;olution which the protector's tender|ne&s;s for his people would not &s;uffer him to &s;ee effected. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I perceive, cried he, in a mode&s;t tone, that the kingdom is re&s;olved to load me with preferments, unequal to my abilities
<PB N="262" REF="264">
or my choice; yet &s;ince it is my duty to obey the dictates of a free people, I will, though reluctantly, accept their petition. I there|fore, from this moment, enter upon the go|vernment of England and France, with a re|&s;olution to defend the one, and &s;ubdue the other."</Q> The crowd being thus di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, each man returned home, pondering upon the proceedings of the day; and making &s;uch re|marks as pa&s;&s;ion, intere&s;t, or party might &s;ug|ge&s;t.</P>

<P>ONE crime ever draws on another; <MILESTONE N="1483" UNIT="A.D."> ju&s;tice will revolt again&s;t fraud, and u&s;urpation re|quires &s;ecurity. As &s;oon, therefore, as Ri|chard was &s;eated upon the throne, he &s;ent the governor of the Tower orders to put the two young princes to death; but this brave man, who&s;e name was Brackenbury, refu&s;ed to be made the in&s;trument of a tyrant's will;
<PB N="264" REF="266">
and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively an&s;wered, that he knew not how to embrue his hands in innocent blood. A fit in&s;trument, however, was not long want|ing; Sir James Tyrrel readily undertook the office, and Brackenbury was ordered to re&s;ign to him the keys for one night. Tyrrel chu&s;ing three a&s;&s;ociates, Slater, Deighton, and Fore&s;t, came in the night-time to the door of the chamber, where the princes were lodged; and &s;ending in the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, he bid them execute their commi&s;&s;ion, while he him&s;elf &s;taid with|out. They found the young princes in bed, and fallen into a &s;ound &s;leep: after &s;uffocating them with the bol&s;ter and pillows, they &s;hew|ed their naked bodies to Tyrrel; who ordered them to be buried at the &s;tair-foot, deep in the ground, under an heap of &s;tones. The&s;e facts appeared in the &s;ucceeding reign, being con|fe&s;&s;ed by the perpetrators; who, however, e&s;|caped puni&s;hment for the crime. The bodies of the princes were afterwards &s;ought for by Henry VII. but could not be found; however, in the reign of Charles II. the bones of two per&s;ons, an&s;wering their age, were found in the very &s;pot where it was &s;aid they were bu|ried: they were interred in a marble monument by order of the king in We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey.</P>
<P>Richard had now waded through every ob|&s;tacle to the throne; and began, after the
<PB N="265" REF="267">
manner of all u&s;urpers, to &s;trengthen his ill-got power by foreign connexions. Sen&s;ible, al&s;o, of the influence of pageantry and &s;hew upon the minds of the people, he cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be crowned fir&s;t at London, and afterwards at York. The clergy he endeavoured to &s;e|cure by great indulgencies; and his friends, by be&s;towing rewards on them, in proportion as they were in&s;trumental in placing him on the throne.</P>
<P>But while he thus endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h his power, he found it threatened on a quarter where he lea&s;t expected an attack. The duke of Buckingham, who had been too in&s;trumental in placing him on the throne, though he had received the greate&s;t rewards for his &s;ervices, yet continued to wi&s;h for more. He had al|ready &s;everal po&s;ts and governments conferred upon him; but that nobleman, who&s;e avarice was in&s;atiable, making a demand of the con|fi&s;cated lands in Hereford, to which his family had an ancient claim, Richard, either reluc|tantly complied with his reque&s;t, or but par|tially indulged it, &s;o that a coolne&s;s &s;oon en|&s;ued; and no &s;ooner had Buckingham &s;up|po&s;ed him&s;elf injured, than he re&s;olved to de|throne a monarch, who&s;e title was found|ed in inju&s;tice. At fir&s;t, however, this a&s;piring
<PB N="266" REF="268">
&s;ubject remained in doubt, whether he &s;hould put up for the crown him&s;elf, or &s;et up an|other; but the latter re&s;olution prevailing, he determined to declare for Henry, earl of Richmond, who was at that time an exile in Brittany, and was con&s;iered as the only &s;ur|viving branch of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter.</P>
<P>Henry, earl of Richmond, was at that time detained in a kind of honourable cu&s;tody by the duke of Brittany. He was one of tho&s;e, who had the good fortune to e&s;cape the nu|merous ma&s;&s;acres of the preceding reigns; but as he was a de&s;cendant of John of Gaunt, by the female line, he was for that rea&s;on ob|noxious to tho&s;e in power. He had long lived in exile; and was, at one time, delivered up to the emba&s;&s;adors of Edward, who were prepar|ing to carry him over to England, when the prince, who delivered him, repented of what he had done, and took him from the amba&s;&s;a|dors ju&s;t as they were leading him on &s;hip|board. This was the youth on whom the duke of Buckingham ca&s;t his eye, to &s;ucceed to the crown, and a negociation was begun be|tween them for that purpo&s;e. Henry's here|ditary right to the throne was doubtful, but the crimes of the u&s;urper &s;erved to &s;trengthen his claims. However, &s;till further to improve his
<PB N="267" REF="269">
title, a marriage was projected between him and the prince&s;s Elizabeth, elde&s;t daughter of the late king, and the queen dowager was pre|vailed on heartily to accede to the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Richard, in the mean time, either informed by his creatures, or kept di&s;tru&s;tful by con|&s;cious guilt, began to &s;u&s;pect Buckingham's fi|delity; and the &s;ecret informations which he daily received, left him no room to doubt of the truth of his &s;u&s;picions. Impre&s;&s;ed with this jealou&s;y, therefore, he formed a re&s;olution of &s;ending for him to court; and the duke's re|fu&s;ing to obey the &s;ummons, confirmed him in his fears. But he &s;oon had the plaine&s;t proofs of Buckingham's enmity, intelligence arriving that this nobleman was at the head of a large body of men in arms, and marching towards the we&s;tern &s;hore. Richard, who&s;e courage no dangers could allay, immediately put him|&s;elf in a po&s;ture of defence, by levying &s;ome troops in the North, and prepared to meet the in&s;urgents with his u&s;ual expedition. But for|tune &s;eemed his friend on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, and rendered all his preparations unnece&s;&s;ary. As Buckingham was advancing by ha&s;ty marches towards Glouce&s;ter, where he de|&s;igned to cro&s;s the Severn, ju&s;t at that time the river was &s;woln to &s;uch a degree, that the
<PB N="268" REF="270">
country on both &s;ides was deluged, and even the tops of &s;ome hills were covered with water. This inundation continued for ten days; during which Buckingham's army, com|po&s;ed of Wel&s;hmen, could neither pa&s;s the river, nor find &s;ub&s;i&s;tence on their own &s;ide; they were, therefore, obliged to di&s;per&s;e, and return home, notwith&s;tanding all the duke's ef|forts to prolong their &s;tay. In this helple&s;s &s;i|tuation, the duke, after a &s;hort deliberation, took refuge at the hou&s;e of one Bani&s;ter, who had been his &s;ervant, and who had received repeated obligations from his family. But the wicked &s;eldom find, as they &s;eldom exert, friend&s;hip. Bani&s;ter, unable to re&s;i&s;t the temp|tation of a large reward that was &s;et upon the duke's head, went and betrayed him to the &s;heriff of Shrop&s;hire; who, &s;urrounding the hou&s;e with armed men, &s;eized the duke, in the habit of a pea&s;ant, and conducted him to Sa|li&s;bury; where he was in&s;tantly tried, con|demned, and executed, according to the &s;um|mary method practi&s;ed in tho&s;e ages.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the duke of Richmond landed in England; but finding his hopes fru&s;trated by the failure of Buckingham, he ha&s;tily &s;et &s;ail again, and returned to Britta|ny. Thus every occurrence &s;eemed to pro|mi&s;e

Richard a long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown; however, the authority of parliament was &s;till wanting to give &s;anction to the inju&s;tice of his proceedings; but in tho&s;e times of ignorance and guilt that was ea&s;ily procured. An act was pa&s;&s;ed, confirming the illegitimacy of Edward's children; an act of attainder al&s;o was confirmed again&s;t Henry, earl of Richmond; and all the u&s;urper's wi&s;hes &s;eemed to be the aim of their deliberations. One thing, however, was want|ing to complete Richard's &s;ecurity, which was the death of his rival; to effect which, he &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to the duke of Brittany, &s;eem|ingly upon bu&s;ine&s;s of a public nature; but, in reality, to treat with Landais, that prince's mini&s;ter, to deliver up Richmond. The mi|ni&s;ter was ba&s;e enough to enter into the nego|tiation; but Richmond having had timely no|tice, fled away into France, and ju&s;t reach|ed the confines of that kingdom when he found that he was pur&s;ued by tho&s;e who intend|ed giving him up to his rival.</P>
<P>Richard thus finding his attempts to &s;eize his enemy's per&s;on un&s;ucce&s;sful, became every day more cruel, as his power grew more pre|carious. Among tho&s;e who chiefly excited his jealou&s;y, was the lord Stanly, who was married to the widow of Edward; and to keep
<PB N="270" REF="272">
him &s;tedfa&s;t in obedience, he took his &s;on as an ho&s;tage for the father's behaviour. He now al&s;o re&s;olved to get rid of his pre&s;ent queen, Anne, to make room for a match with his niece, the prince&s;s Elizabeth, by who&s;e alliance he hoped to cover the inju&s;tice of his claims. This lady, whom he de&s;ired to get rid of, was the widow of the young prince of Wales, whom he had murdered with his own hands at Tewk&s;bury; and it is no &s;light indication of the barbarity of the times, that the widow &s;hould accept for her &s;econd lord, the mur|derer of her former hu&s;band. But &s;he was now rewarded for her former inhumanity, as Richard treated her with &s;o much pride and indifference, that &s;he died with grief, accord|ing to his ardent expectation. However, his wi&s;hes were not crowned with &s;ucce&s;s in his applications to Elizabeth; the mother, indeed, was not aver&s;e to the match; but the prince&s;s her&s;elf treated his vile addre&s;&s;es with contempt and dete&s;tation.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the perplexity cau&s;ed by this unex|pected refu&s;al, he received information, that the earl of Richmond was once more making preparations to land in England, and a&s;&s;ert his claims to the crown. Richard, who knew not in what quarter he might expect the invader,
<PB N="271" REF="273">
had taken po&s;t at Nottingham, in the centre of the kingdom; and had given commi&s;&s;ions to &s;everal of his creatures, to oppo&s;e the enemy wherever he &s;hould land. The account re|ceived of Richmond's preparations were not ungrounded; he &s;et out from Harfleur in Normandy, with a retinue of about two thou|&s;and per&s;ons; and, after a voyage of &s;ix days, arrived at Milford-Haven, in Wales, where he landed without oppo&s;ition. Sir Rice ap Tho|mas, and Sir Walter Herbert, who were in-tru&s;ted to oppo&s;e him in Wales, were both in his intere&s;ts; the one immediately de&s;erted to him, and the other made but a feeble oppo&s;i|tion. Upon news of this de&s;cent, Richard, who was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of courage and military con|duct, his only virtues, in&s;tantly re&s;olved to meet his antagoni&s;t, and decide their mutual preten|&s;ions by a battle. Richmond, on the other hand, being reinforced by Sir Thomas Bour|chier, Sir Walter Hungerford, and others, to the number of about &s;ix thou&s;and, boldly ad|vanced with the &s;ame intention; and in a few days, both armies drew near Bo&s;worth-field, to determine a conte&s;t that had now for more than forty years filled the kingdom with ci|vil commotions and deluged its plains with blood.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="274">The army of Richard was above double that of Henry; but the chief confidence of the latter lay in the friend&s;hip and &s;ecret a&s;&s;uran|ces of lord Stanly, who, with a body of &s;even thou&s;and men, hovered near the field of battle, and declined engaging on either &s;ide.</P>
<P>Richard perceiving his enemy advance, drew up his army, con&s;i&s;ting of about thirteen thou&s;and men, in order of battle; he gave the command of the van-guard to the duke of Norfolk, while he led the main body him&s;elf, with the crown on his head, de&s;igning by this either to in&s;pire the enemy with awe, or to ren|der him&s;elf con&s;picuous to his own army. The van of Richmond's army, con&s;i&s;ting of archers, was commanded by John, earl of Oxford; Sir Gilbert Talbot led the right wing, Sir John &s;avage the left; while the earl him|&s;elf, accompanied by his uncle, the earl of Pembroke, placed him&s;elf in the main body. Lord Stanly, in the mean time, po&s;ted him|&s;elf on one flank, between the two armies, while his brother took his &s;tation on the other, which was oppo&s;ite. Richard &s;eeing him thus in a &s;ituation equally convenient for joining either army, immediately &s;ent him orders to unite him&s;elf to the main body, which the o|ther refu&s;ing, he gave in&s;tant orders for be|heading
<PB N="273" REF="275">
lord Stanley's &s;on, whom he &s;till kept as an ho&s;tage. He was per&s;uaded, however, to po&s;tpone the execution till after the fight; and attending to the more important tran&s;ac|tions of the day, he directed the trumpets to &s;ound to battle. The two armies approaching each other, the battle began with a &s;hower of arrows, and &s;oon the adver&s;e fronts were &s;een clo&s;ing. This was what lord Stanley had for &s;ome time expected, who immediately profit|ing by the occa&s;ion, joined the line of Rich|mond, and thus turned the fortune of the day. This mea&s;ure, which was &s;o unexpected to the men, though not to their leaders, had a pro|portioned effect on both armies, it in&s;pired unu&s;ual courage into Henry's &s;oldiers, and threw Richard's into confu&s;ion. The intrepid tyrant perceiving the danger of his &s;ituation, &s;purred up his hor&s;e into the thicke&s;t of the fight, while Richmond quitted his &s;tation be|hind, to encourage his troops by his pre&s;ence in the front. Richard perceiving him, was de|&s;irous of ending all by one blow; and with ir|re&s;i&s;tible fury flew through thou&s;ands to attack him. He &s;lew &s;ir William Brandon, the earl's &s;tandard bearer, who attempted to &s;top his ca|reer. Sir John Cheney having taken Brandon's place, was thrown by him to the ground. Rich|mond, in the mean time &s;tood firm to oppo&s;e
<PB N="274" REF="276">
him; but they were &s;eparated by the interpo&s;ing crowd. Richard, thus di&s;appointed, went, by his pre&s;ence, to in&s;pire his troops at another quarter; but at length perceiving his army every where yielding or flying, and now finding that all was gone, he ru&s;hed with a loud &s;hout into the mid&s;t of the enemy, and there met a better death than his crimes and cruelties de&s;erved. After the bat|tle, his body was found &s;tripped among an heap of &s;lain, covered over with wounds, and the eyes frightfully &s;taring. In this manner it was thrown acro&s;s an hor&s;e, the head hanging down on one &s;ide, and the legs on the other, and thus carried to Leice&s;ter. It lay there two days expo&s;ed to public view, and then was buried without farther ceremony.</P>
<P>Richard's crown being found by one of Henry's &s;oldiers on the field of battle, it was immediately placed upon the head of the con|queror, while the whole army, as if in&s;pired with one voice, cried out, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Long live king Henry!"</Q></P>
<P>Thus ended the bloody reign of Richard; and by his death the race of the Plantagenet kings, who had been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown during the &s;pace of three hundred and thirty years, became extinct. Thus ended al&s;o the conte&s;ts between the hou&s;es of York and Lan|ca&s;ter, by which mo&s;t of the ancient families
<PB N="275" REF="277">
of the kingdom were extingui&s;hed, and more than an hundred thou&s;and men lo&s;t their lives, either by the &s;word or the executioner.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;&s;en&s;ions had, for &s;ome time, re|duced the kingdom to a &s;tate of &s;avage bar|barity. Laws, arts, and commerce, which had before emitted &s;ome feeble gleams, were en|tirely neglected for the practice of arms; and to be a conqueror was &s;ufficient, in the eyes of the brutal people, to &s;tand for every other vir|tue. The Engli&s;h had, as yet, but little idea of legal &s;ubordination; nor could they give any applau&s;e to tho&s;e who attempted to cultivate the arts of peace, the whole of their &s;tudy and education being turned for war. The fero|city of the people to each other was incredi|ble. However, the women, whatever part they took in the di&s;turbances of the govern|ment, were exempted from capital puni&s;h|ments; nor were they ever put to death, ex|cept when convicted of witchcraft or poi&s;on|ing. As for the clergy, they were entirely di|&s;tinct from the laity, both in cu&s;toms, laws, and learning. They were governed by the code of civil law, drawn up in the times of Ju&s;tinian; while the laity were held by the common-law, which had been traditional from times immemo|rial in the country. The clergy, however we
<PB N="276" REF="278">
may be told to the contrary, under&s;tood and wrote Latin fluently; while the laity, on the other hand, under&s;tood nothing of Latin, but applied them&s;elves wholly to the French lan|guage, when they a&s;pired at the character of a polite education. The clergy, as a body di|&s;tinct from the &s;tate, little intere&s;ted them|&s;elves in civil polity; and perhaps they were not di&s;plea&s;ed to &s;ee the laity, whom they con|&s;idered le&s;s as fellow-&s;ubjects than rivals for power, weakening them&s;elves by continual conte&s;ts, and thus rendering them&s;elves more ea&s;ily manageable. In &s;hort, as there was no knowlege of government among the individu|als, but what totally re&s;ulted from power, the &s;tate was like a feveri&s;h con&s;titution, ever &s;ub|ject to ferment and di&s;order. France, indeed, had &s;erved for &s;ome time as a drain for the peccant humours; but when that was no lon|ger open, the di&s;orders of the con&s;titution &s;eemed daily to encrea&s;e, and vented them|&s;elves at la&s;t in all the horrors of a long con|tinued civil war.</P>

</FIGURE>CHAP. XXII. HENRY VII.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER having pre&s;ented the reader with a frightful train of trea&s;ons, &s;tratagems,<MILESTONE N="1485" UNIT="A.D."> mur|ders, and u&s;urpations, we are now beginning to emerge into a time of greater importance and glory. We are now to view the conduct of a monarch, who, if not the be&s;t, was, at lea&s;t, the mo&s;t u&s;eful of any that ever &s;ate upon the Briti&s;h throne. We are now to be|hold
<PB N="278" REF="280">
a nation of tumult reduced to civil &s;ub|ordination; an in&s;olent and factious ari&s;to|cracy humbled, wi&s;e laws enacted, commerce re&s;tored, and the peaceful arts made amiable to a people, for whom war alone heretofore had charms. Hitherto we have on]y beheld the actions of a barbarous nation, obeying with re|luctance, and governed by caprice; but hence|forward we may di&s;cover more refined politics, and better concerted &s;chemes; human wi&s;|dom, as if rou&s;ed from her lethargy of thir|teen hundred years, exerting all her efforts to &s;ubdue the natural ferocity of the people, and to introduce permanent felicity.</P>
<P>Henry's fir&s;t care upon coming to the throne, was to marry the prince&s;s Elizabeth, daughter of Edward the fourth; and thus he blended the intere&s;ts of the hou&s;es of York and Lan|ca&s;ter, &s;o that ever after they were incapable of di&s;tinction. Neverthele&s;s, being apprehen&s;ive that the people might &s;uppo&s;e he claimed the crown in right of this union, he deferred the queen's coronation till two years after, by which he made the priority of his own claim incon|te&s;table. His reign al&s;o happily commenced with an obedience to the forms of law, of which England had hitherto &s;een but few ex|amples. An act had been pa&s;&s;ed in the pre|ceding
<PB N="279" REF="281">
reign for the attainder of his friends and followers, which continued &s;till in force; and the names of many members of that hou&s;e, by which it was to be repealed, were expre&s;ly mentioned in the attainder. To &s;uf|fer the&s;e to join in repealing that &s;tatute, would be admitting them as judges in their own cau&s;e; but to this Henry prudently objected, obliging them to leave the hou&s;e, till an act was pa&s;&s;ed for rever&s;ing their attainder.</P>
<P>Before this reign, it had been u&s;ual with any per&s;on who was attainted, after his execu|tion, to give away his e&s;tates to any of the court favourites that happened to be mo&s;t in confidence. Henry wi&s;ely perceived that this &s;everity had two bad effects; the cruelty of the mea&s;ure in the fir&s;t place excited indigna|tion; and it al&s;o made the favourite too powerful for &s;ubjection. In order to re|medy the&s;e inconveniencies, he made a law to deprive tho&s;e who were found in arms of their e&s;tates and effects, and &s;eque&s;ter them for the benefit of the crown.</P>
<P>A great part of the mi&s;eries of his prede|ce&s;&s;ors proceeded from their poverty, which was mo&s;tly occa&s;ioned by riot and di&s;&s;ipation. Henry &s;aw that money alone could turn the &s;cale of power in his favour; and therefore
<PB N="280" REF="282">
hoarded up all the confi&s;cations of his enemies with the utmo&s;t frugality. From hence he has been accu&s;ed by hi&s;torians of avarice; but that avarice which tends to &s;trengthen govern|ment, and repre&s;s &s;edition, is not only excu&s;e|able, but prai&s;e-worthy. Liberality in a king is too often a mi&s;placed virtue. What is thus given, is generally extorted from the indu&s;|trious and needy, to be lavi&s;hed as rewards on the rich, the in&s;idious, and the fawning, upon the &s;ycophants of a court, or the improvers of luxurious refinement. Henry &s;hewed him&s;elf very different from his predece&s;&s;ors in the&s;e re|&s;pects, as he gave away very few rewards to the courtiers about his per&s;on; and none ex|cept the needy &s;hared his benefactions. He relea&s;ed all pri&s;oners for debt in his domi|nions, who&s;e debts did not amount to forty &s;hillings, and paid their creditors from the royal coffers. Thus his oeconomy rendered him not only u&s;eful to the poor, but enabled him to be ju&s;t to his own creditors, either a|broad or at home. Tho&s;e &s;ums which he bor|rowed from the city of London, or any of his &s;ubjects, he repaid at the appointed day with the utmo&s;t punctuality; and in propor|tion as he was e&s;teemed in his own dominions, he became re&s;pectable abroad.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="283">With regard to the king's &s;ervants, he was him&s;elf the only acting mini&s;ter; and as for the re&s;t, he did not chu&s;e his under-agents from among the nobility, as had been mo&s;t u&s;ual; but pitched upon John Morton, and Richard Fox, two clergymen, per&s;ons of in|du&s;try, vigilance, and capacity, to whom he chiefly confided his affairs and &s;ecret councils. They had &s;hared with him in all his former dangers and di&s;tre&s;&s;es; and he now took care that they &s;hould participate in his good for|tune; the one being &s;oon after created bi&s;hop of Ely, the other bi&s;hop of Exeter. He per|haps &s;uppo&s;ed, that as clergymen were natu|rally more dependent on him than the nobili|ty, &s;o they would be more &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to his commands, and more active in their &s;ervices.</P>
<P>Immediately after his marriage with Eliza|beth, he i&s;&s;ued a general pardon to all &s;uch as cho&s;e to accept it; but tho&s;e lords who had been the favourites of the la&s;t reign, and long accu&s;tomed to turbulence, refu&s;ed his profered tenderne&s;s, and flew to arms. Lord Lovel, together with Humphrey and Thomas Staf|ford, placed them&s;elves at the head of this in|&s;urrection; but Henry &s;ent the duke of Bed|ford to oppo&s;e them, with orders to try what might be done by offering a pardon, before
<PB N="282" REF="284">
he made any attempts to reduce them. The duke punctually obeyed his in&s;tructions; and a general promi&s;e of pardon was made to the rebels, which had a greater effect on the leaders than on their followers. Lovel, who had un|dertaken an enterprize that exceeded his cou|rage and capacity, was &s;o terrified with the fears of de&s;ertion among his troops, that he &s;uddenly withdrew him&s;elf; and, after lurking &s;ome time in Lanca&s;hire, made his e&s;cape into Flanders, where he was protected by the dutche&s;s of Burgundy. The Staffords took &s;anctuary in the church of Colnham, a village near Abingdon; but it appearing that this church had not the privilege of giving protec|tion, they were taken thence; the elde&s;t Staf|ford was executed at Tyburn; the younger, pleading that he was mi&s;led by his brother, ob|tained his pardon. The rebel army, now with|out a leader, &s;ubmitted to the mercy of the king, and were permitted to di&s;per&s;e without farther puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>But the people were become &s;o turbulent and factious by a long cour&s;e of civil war, that no governor could rule them, nor any king plea&s;e; &s;o that one rebellion &s;eemed extin|gui&s;hed only to give ri&s;e to another. The king, in the beginning of his reign, had given
<PB N="283" REF="285">
orders that the &s;on of the duke of Clarence, whom we have already mentioned as being drowned in a wine-butt, &s;hould be taken from the pri&s;on where he had been confined by Rich|ard, and brought to the Tower. This unfortu|nate youth, who was &s;tyled the earl of Warwick, was, by long confinement, &s;o unacquainted with the world, that, as we are told, he could not tell the difference between a duck and an hen. However, the unhappy youth, harm|le&s;s as he was, was made an in&s;trument to deceive the people. There lived in Oxford one Richard Simon, a prie&s;t, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;ome &s;ubtlety, and more ra&s;hne&s;s, trained up one Lambert Simnel, a baker's &s;on, to coun|terfeit the per&s;on of the earl of Warwick; and he was previou&s;ly in&s;tructed by his tutor to talk upon many facts and occurrences, as happening to him in the court of Edward. But as the impo&s;ture was not calculated to bear a clo&s;e in&s;pection, it was thought proper to &s;hew him fir&s;t at a di&s;tance; and Ireland was judged the fitte&s;t theatre for him to &s;up|port his a&s;&s;umed character. The plot unfolded to their wi&s;hes; Simnel was received with the utmo&s;t joy, and proclaimed king of Ireland; he was conducted by the magi&s;trates and the po|pulace of Dublin with great pomp to the Ca&s;|tle,
<PB N="284" REF="286">
where he was treated conformably to his &s;uppo&s;ed birth and di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>Henry could not help feeling more unea&s;i|ne&s;s at this bare-faced impo&s;ture than it &s;eem|ed to de&s;erve; but the penetrating monarch &s;aw that his mother-in-law was at the bottom of it; and he dreaded the fierce inquietude of her temper. He was re&s;olved, therefore, to take the advice of his council upon this occa|&s;ion; and they, after due deliberation, deter|mined upon confining the old queen to a mo|na&s;tery; but, to wipe off the imputation of trea|&s;on from one &s;o nearly allied to the crown, it was given out, that &s;he was thus puni&s;hed for having formerly delivered up the prince&s;s her daughter to Richard. The people as u&s;ual murmured at the &s;everity of her treatment; but the king, unmindful of their idle cla|mours, per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;olution; and &s;he re|mained in confinement till her death, which did not happen till &s;everal years after. The next mea&s;ure was to &s;hew Warwick to the people. In con&s;equence of this, he was taken from the Tower, and led through the princi|pal &s;treets of London, after which he was conducted in &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion to St. Paul's, where great numbers were a&s;&s;embled to &s;ee him. Still, however, they proceeded in Dub|lin
<PB N="285" REF="287">
to honour their pretended monarch; and he was crowned with great &s;olemnity, in pre|&s;ence of the earl of Kildare, the chancellor, and the other officers of &s;tate. Such impo&s;i|tions upon the people, were very frequent at that time, in &s;everal parts of Europe. Lor|rain, Naples, and Portugal, had their impo&s;|tors, who continued to deceive for a long time without detection. In fact, the inhabitants of every country, were &s;o much confined within their own limits, and knew &s;o little of what was pa&s;&s;ing in the re&s;t of the world, that any di&s;tant &s;tory might be propagated, how im|probable &s;oever. In this manner, king Sim|nel, being now joined by lord Lovel, and one or two lords more of the di&s;contented party, re&s;olved to pa&s;s over into England; and accor|dingly landed in Lanca&s;hire, from whence he marched to York, expecting the country would ri&s;e and join him as he marched along. But in this he was deceived; the people aver&s;e to join a body of German and Iri&s;h troops, by whom he was &s;upported, and kept in awe by the king's reputation, remained in tranquility, or gave all their a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the royal cau&s;e. The earl of Lincoln, therefore, a di&s;affected lord, to whom the command of the rebel army was given, finding no hopes but in &s;peedy vic|tory,
<PB N="286" REF="288">
was determined to bring the conte&s;t to a &s;hort i&s;&s;ue. The oppo&s;ite armies met at Stoke, in the county of Nottingham, and fought a battle, which was more bloody, and more ob&s;tinately di&s;puted, than could have been expected from the inequality of their forces. But victory at length declared in favour of the king, and it proved deci&s;ive. Lord Lincoln peri&s;hed in the field of battle; lord Lovel was never more heard of, and it was &s;uppo&s;ed he &s;hared the &s;ame fate. Simnel, with his tutor Simon, was taken pri&s;oner; and four thou&s;and of the common men fell in bat|tle. Simon being a prie&s;t could not be tried by the civil power, and was only committed to clo&s;e confinement. Simnel was too contemp|tible to excite the king's fears or re&s;entment; he was pardoned, and made a &s;cullion in the king's kitchen, whence he was afterwards ad|vanced to the rank of falconer, in which mean employment he died.</P>
<P>Things being thus quietly &s;ettled at home; Henry began to turn his thoughts towards his continental connexions, and to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome degree of under&s;tanding between him and the neighbouring &s;tates around him. He was too wi&s;e a prince, not to perceive the fatality of conque&s;ts upon the continent, which could at
<PB N="287" REF="289">
be&s;t produce no other reputation than the empty one of military glory. Yet, while he internally de&s;pi&s;ed &s;uch pernicious triumphs, he was ob|liged, in order to gain popularity, to counte|nance them. He, therefore, frequently boa&s;t|ed that he was determined to ravi&s;h his king|dom of France from the u&s;urpers, who had long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it; and that he would lay the whole country in blood. But the&s;e were the di&s;tant threats of a crafty politician; there was nothing more di&s;tant from his heart. As far as negociations went, he did all in his power; to keep the intere&s;ts of that kingdom &s;o nearly balanced, as to prevent any from growing too powerful; but as for &s;uccours of men and money, he too well knew the value of both to lavi&s;h them, as his predece&s;&s;ors had done, upon &s;uch fruitle&s;s projects.</P>
<P>About this time the nobles of Brittany, be|ing di&s;gu&s;ted with their mini&s;ter, Peter Lan|dais, ro&s;e in con&s;piracy again&s;t him,<MILESTONE N="1488" UNIT="A.D."> and put him to death. Willing to defend one crime by another, they called in the aid of the French monarch, to protect them from the re&s;entment of their own &s;overeign. The French monarch quickly obeyed the call; but in&s;tead of only bringing the nobles a&s;&s;i&s;tance, over-ran and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the greate&s;t part of the
<PB N="288" REF="290">
country. The aid of Henry was implored by the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Bretons; but this mo|narch appeared more willing to a&s;&s;i&s;t them by negociations than by arms; but though he de|termined to maintain a pacific conduct, as far as the &s;ituation of his affairs would permit, he knew too well the warlike di&s;po&s;ition of his &s;ubjects, and their de&s;ires to engage in any &s;cheme that promi&s;ed the humiliation of France, He re&s;olved, therefore, to take advantage of this propen&s;ity; and to draw &s;ome &s;upplies of money from the people, on pretence of giving a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the duke of Brittany. He ac|cordingly &s;ummoned a parliament to meet at We&s;tmin&s;ter, and ea&s;ily per&s;uaded them to grant him a con&s;iderable &s;upply. But money was, at that time, more ea&s;ily granted than le|vied in England. A new in&s;urrection began in York&s;hire, the people re&s;i&s;ting the commi&s;|&s;ioners who were appointed to levy the tax. The earl of Northumberland attempted to en|force the king's command; but the populace, being by this taught to believe that he was the advi&s;er of their oppre&s;&s;ions, flew to arms, at|tacked his hou&s;e, and put him to death. The mutineers did not &s;top there; but, by the ad|vice of one John Achamber, a &s;editious fellow of mean birth, they cho&s;e Sir John Egremont
<PB N="289" REF="291">
for their leader, and prepared them&s;elves for a vigorous re&s;i&s;tance. The king, upon hearing this ra&s;h proceeding, immediately levied a force, which he put under the earl of Surry; and this nobleman, encountering the rebels, di&s;&s;ipated the tumult, and took their leader, Achamber, pri&s;oner. Achamber was &s;hortly after executed; but Sir John Egremont fled to the court of the dutche&s;s of Burgundy, the u&s;ual retreat of all who were obnoxious to government in England.</P>
<P>As Henry had gone thus far in prepara|tions for a war with France, he &s;uppo&s;ed that it would be too flagrant an impo&s;ition upon the credulity of the nation, not to put a part of his threats in execution. France was by this time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all Brittany; and a marriage had been lately concluded between the French monarch, and the dutche&s;s of the la&s;t named territory. This acce&s;&s;ion of power, in a rival &s;tate, was formidable not only to Henry, but to Europe. He, therefore, prepared to make a de&s;cent upon France; and accordingly land|ed at Calais, with an army of twenty-five thou|&s;and foot, and &s;ixteen hundred hor&s;e, which he put under the command of the duke of Bed|ford and the earl of Oxford. But notwith&s;tand|ing this appearance of an ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;ition,
<PB N="290" REF="292">
there had been &s;ecret advances made towards a peace three months before, and commi&s;&s;ion|ers had been appointed to treat on the terms. The demands of Henry were wholly pecuniary; and the king of France, who deemed the peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Brittany an equivalent for any &s;um, readily agreed to the propo&s;als made him. He engaged to pay Henry near two hun|dred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, as a reimbur&s;e|ment for the expences of his expedition; and he &s;tipulated to pay a yearly pen&s;ion to him, and his heirs, of twenty-five thou&s;and crowns more.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1492" UNIT="A.D."> Henry, having thus made an advantageous peace, had rea&s;on to flatter him&s;elf with the pro&s;|pect of long tranquility; but he was mi&s;taken; he had &s;till enemies who found means to embroil him in fre&s;h difficulties and dangers. One would have imagined, that from the ill &s;ucce&s;s of Simnel's impo&s;ture, few would be willing to embark in another of a &s;imilar kind; however, the old dutche&s;s of Burgundy, rather irritated than di&s;couraged by the failure of her pa&s;t enterprizes, was determined to di&s;turb that government, which &s;he could not &s;ubvert. She fir&s;t procured a report to be &s;pread, that the young duke of York, &s;aid to have been murdered in the Tower, was &s;till living; and finding the rumour greedily received, &s;he &s;oon
<PB N="291" REF="293">
produced a young man, who a&s;&s;umed his name and character. The per&s;on pitched upon to &s;u&s;tain this part, was one O&s;beck or Warbeck, the &s;on of a converted Jew, who had been over in England during the reign of Edward IV. where he had this &s;on named Peter, but corrupted, after the Flemi&s;h manner, into Peterkin or Perkin. It was by &s;ome believed that Edward, among his other amorous adventures, had a &s;ecret corre&s;pondence with Warbeck's wife, which might account for a &s;triking re&s;emblance between young Perkin and that monarch. Per|kin, following the fortunes of his father, had travelled for many years from place to place; &s;o that his birth and circum&s;tances became thereby unknown, and difficult to be traced by the mo&s;t diligent enquiry. The variety of his adventures might have contributed to a&s;&s;i&s;t the natural &s;agacity, and ver&s;atility of his di&s;|po&s;ition; as he &s;eemed to be a youth capable of &s;u&s;taining any part or any a&s;&s;umed character. The dutche&s;s of Burgundy found this youth entirely &s;uited to her purpo&s;es; and her le&s;&s;ons, in&s;tructing him to per&s;onate the duke of York, were ea&s;ily learned, and &s;trongly retained by a youth of &s;uch quick apprehen&s;ion. In &s;hort, his graceful air, his courtly addre&s;s, his ea&s;y manners, and elegant conver&s;ation, were ca|pable
<PB N="292" REF="294">
of impo&s;ing upon all but &s;uch as were con&s;cious of the impo&s;ture.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Ireland, which &s;till retain|ed its attachments to the hou&s;e of York, was pitched upon as the proper place for Perkin's fir&s;t appearance, as it before had favoured that of Simnel. He landed at Corke; and imme|diately a&s;&s;uming the name of Richard Plan|tagenet, drew to him numerous partizans among that credulous people. He wrote let|ters to the earls of De&s;mond and Kildare, in|viting them to join his party; he di&s;per&s;ed every where the &s;trange intelligence of his e&s;|cape from his uncle Richard's cruelty; and men, fond of every thing new and wonderful, began to make him the general &s;ubject of their di&s;cour&s;e, and even the object of their favour. From Ireland his fame &s;oon &s;pread over into France; and Charles &s;ent Perkin an invitation to his court, where he received him with all the marks of con&s;ideration that were due to his &s;uppo&s;ed dignity. The youth, no way dazzled by his elevation, &s;upported the pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion which was &s;pread abroad in his fa|vour; &s;o that England it&s;elf &s;oon began to give credit to his preten&s;ions; while Sir George Neville, Sir John Taylor, and above a hun|dred gentlemen more, went to Paris to pay
<PB N="293" REF="295">
him homage, and offer their &s;ervices. Upon the peace being &s;hortly after concluded be|tween France and England, the impo&s;tor was obliged to make his re&s;idence at the court of his old patrone&s;s, the dutche&s;s of Burgundy, and the interview between the&s;e con&s;cious de|ceivers was truly ridiculous. The dutche&s;s affected the utmo&s;t ignorance of his preten|&s;ions, and even put on the appearance of di&s;|tru&s;t; having, as &s;he &s;aid, been already deceiv|ed by Simnel. She &s;eemed to examine all his a&s;&s;ertions with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous diffi|dence; put many particular que&s;tions to him, affected a&s;toni&s;hment at his an&s;wers, and at la&s;t, after long and &s;evere &s;crutiny, bur&s;t out into joy and admiration at his delivery, ac|knowledging him as her nephew, as the true image of Edward, and legitimate &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the Engli&s;h throne. She immediately a&s;|&s;igned him an equipage &s;uitable to his preten|&s;ions, appointed him a guard of thirty halber|diers; and on all occa&s;ions honoured him with the appellation of the White Ro&s;e of England.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h, ever ready to revolt, gave cre|dit to all the&s;e ab&s;urdities; while the young man's prudence, conver&s;ation, and deportment, &s;erved to confirm what their di&s;affection and credulity had begun. All &s;uch as were di&s;|gu&s;ted
<PB N="294" REF="296">
with the king, prepared to join him, but particularly tho&s;e that were formerly Hen|ry's favourites, and had contributed to place him on the throne; thinking their &s;ervices could never be &s;ufficiently repaid, now pri|vately abetted the impo&s;ture, and became heads of the con&s;piracy. The&s;e were joined by numbers of the inferior cla&s;s, &s;ome greedy of novelty, &s;ome blindly attached to their leaders, and &s;ome induced by their de&s;perate fortunes to wi&s;h for a change.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e who &s;ecretly abetted the cau&s;e of Perkin, were lord Fitzwater, Sir Simon Mountfort, Sir Thomas Thwaits, and Sir Robert Clifford. But the per&s;on of the great|e&s;t weight, and the mo&s;t dangerous oppo&s;ition, was Sir William Stanley the lord chamberlain, and brother to the famous lord Stanley, who had contributed to place Henry on the throne. This per&s;onage, either moved by a blind cre|dulity, or more probably by a re&s;tle&s;s ambi|tion, entered into a regular con&s;piracy again&s;t the king; and a corr&s;epondence was &s;ettled between the malecontents in England and tho&s;e in Flanders.</P>
<P>While the plot was thus carrying on in all quarters, Henry was not inattentive to the de|&s;igns of his enemies. He &s;pared neither labour
<PB N="295" REF="297">
nor expence to detect the fal&s;ehood of the pre|tender to his crown; and was equally a&s;&s;iduous in finding out who were his &s;ecret abettors. For this purpo&s;e he di&s;per&s;ed his &s;pies thro' all Flanders, and brought over, by large bribes, &s;ome of tho&s;e whom he knew to be in the ene|mies intere&s;ts. Among the&s;e, Sir Robert Clif|ford was the mo&s;t remarkable, both for his con&s;equence, and the confidence with which he was tru&s;ted. From this per&s;on Henry learned the whole of Perkin's birth and ad|ventures, together with the names of all tho&s;e who had &s;ecretly combined to a&s;&s;i&s;t him. The king was plea&s;ed with the di&s;covery; but the more tru&s;t he gave to his &s;pies, the higher re|&s;entment did he feign again&s;t them.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t he was &s;truck with indignation at the ingratitude of many of tho&s;e about him; but concealing his re&s;entment for a proper op|portunity, he, almo&s;t at the &s;ame in&s;tant, arre&s;t|ed Fitzwater, Mounfort, and Thwaits, together with William Danbery, Robert Ratcliff, Tho|mas Cre&s;&s;enor, and Thomas A&s;twood. All the&s;e were arraigned, convicted, and condem|ned for high trea&s;on. Mountfort, Ratcliff, and Danbery, were immediately executed; the re&s;t received pardon. But the principal delin|quent yet remained to be puni&s;hed, who&s;e &s;tation,
<PB N="296" REF="298">
as lord chamberlain, and who&s;e connexions with many of the principal men in the king|dom, &s;eemed to exempt him from cen&s;ure. To effect this, Clifford was directed to come over privately to England, and to accu&s;e Stanley in per&s;on, which he did to the &s;eeming a&s;toni&s;h|ment of all pre&s;ent. Henry affected to receive the intelligence as fal&s;e and incredible; but Clifford per&s;i&s;ting in his accu&s;ation, Stanley was committed to cu&s;tody, and &s;oon after ex|amined before the council. Finding his guilt but too clearly proved, he did not attempt to conceal it, &s;uppo&s;ing that an open confe&s;&s;ion might &s;erve as an atonement, or tru&s;ting to his former &s;ervices for pardon and &s;ecurity. In this he was mi&s;taken; after a delay of &s;ix weeks, during which time the king affected to deliberate upon his conduct, he was brought to trial, when he was condemned, and &s;hortly after beheaded. Through the whole of this reign, the king &s;eemed to make a di&s;tinction in the crimes of tho&s;e who con&s;pired again&s;t him: whenever a con&s;pirator took up arms again&s;t him, from a con&s;cientious adherence to principle, and a love of the hou&s;e of York, he generally found pardon; but when a love of change, or an impatience of &s;ubordination in|&s;pired the attempt, the offender was &s;ure to be treated with the utmo&s;t rigour of the law.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="299">While the adherents of Perkin were thus di&s;appointed in England, he him&s;elf attempt|ed landing in Kent; the gentlemen of which county gathered in a body to oppo&s;e him. Their aim was to allure him on &s;hore by prof|fers of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and then &s;eize his per&s;on; but the wary youth, ob&s;erving that they had more order and regularity in their movements than could be &s;uppo&s;ed in new levied forces, refu&s;ed to commit him&s;elf into their hands; wherefore they &s;et upon his attendants, who had come a-&s;hore, of whom they took an hun|dred and fifty pri&s;oners. The&s;e were tried and condemned, and all of them executed by order of the king, who was re&s;olved to u&s;e no lenity to men of &s;uch de&s;perate fortunes.</P>
<P>The young adventurer finding his hopes fru&s;trated in this attempt, went next to try his fortune in Scotland. In that country his luck &s;eemed greater than in England. James the fourth, the king of that country, received him with great cordiality; he was &s;educed to be|lieve the &s;tory of his birth and adventures; and he carried his confidence &s;o far, as to give him in marriage lady Catharine Gordon, daughter to the earl of Huntley, and a near kin&s;woman of his own; a young lady eminent
<PB N="298" REF="300">
for virtue as well as beauty. But not content with the&s;e in&s;tances of favour, he was re&s;olved to attempt &s;etting him on the throne of Eng|land. It was naturally expected, that upon Perkin's fir&s;t appearance in that kingdom, all the friends of the hou&s;e of York would ri&s;e in his favour. Upon this ground, therefore, the king of Scotland entered England with a nu|merous army, and proclaimed the young ad|venturer wherever he went. But Perkin's preten&s;ions, attended by repeated di&s;appoint|ments, were now become &s;tale, even in the eyes of the populace; &s;o that, contrary to expecta|tion, none were found to &s;econd his preten|&s;ions. Being di&s;appointed in this, he once more returned to Edinburgh, where he con|tinued to re&s;ide, till, upon the conclu&s;ion of a treaty of peace between the two kingdoms, he was once more obliged to leave Scotland, and to &s;eek for a new protector.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Henry found little unea|&s;ine&s;s at Perkin's irruption, as he was &s;en&s;ible it would &s;erve him as a pretext to a demand for further &s;upplies from parliament, with which he knew they would readily comply. The vote was in fact ea&s;ily enough obtained; but he found it not &s;o ea&s;y to levy the mo|ney. The inhabitants of Cornwall were
<PB N="299" REF="301">
the fir&s;t to refu&s;e contributing &s;upplies for the &s;afety of the northern parts of the kingdom, which were &s;o very remote from them. Their di&s;contents were further inflamed by one Michael Jo&s;eph, a farrier of Bodmin, who had long been the &s;poke&s;man of the multi|tude. To him was joined one Thomas Flam|mock, a lawyer; and under the conduct of the&s;e two, the in&s;urgents pa&s;&s;ed through the county of Devon, and reached that of Somer|&s;et, where they were joined by lord Audley, a nobleman of an ancient family, popular in his deportment, but vain, ambitious, and re&s;t|le&s;s in his temper. Thus headed, and breath|ing de&s;truction to the king's commi&s;&s;ioners, they marched with great &s;peed towards Lon|don, without, however, committing any de|va&s;tations by the way. At length, without receiving countenance or reinforcement on their march, they pitched their camp near Elt|ham, not far from London. Henry, who&s;e courage and intrepidity were never to be moved, had &s;ome time before levied an army to oppo&s;e the Scotch; and this he ordered &s;outh|ward to &s;uppre&s;s the Corni&s;h in&s;urrection. On other occa&s;ions it was u&s;ual with him to ha&s;ten to a deci&s;ion; and it was a &s;aying with him, that he only de&s;ired to &s;ee his rebels; but as
<PB N="300" REF="302">
the pre&s;ent in&s;urgents behaved in an inoffen&s;ive manner, he protracted his attack for &s;ome time, till at length it was begun by lord Daubeny, who, after &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance, broke, and put them to flight. Lord Audley, Flammock, and Jo&s;eph, their leaders, were taken and exe|cuted; but the re&s;t, to the number of &s;ix|teen thou&s;and, were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed without further puni&s;hment.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1497" UNIT="A.D."> In the mean time, the re&s;tle&s;s Perkin being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Scotland, and meeting with a very cold reception from the Flemings, who now de&s;ired to be at peace with the Engli&s;h, re|&s;olved to continue his &s;cheme of oppo&s;ition; and once more took refuge among the wilds and fa&s;tne&s;&s;es of Ireland. Impatient, how|ever, of an inactive life, he held a con&s;ultation with his followers, Herne, Skelton, and A&s;t|ley, three broken trade&s;men; and by their ad|vice he re&s;olved to try the affections of the Corni&s;h men, who&s;e di&s;contents the king's late lenity had only contributed to enflame. The&s;e were a tumultuous multitude, too ignorant for gratitude; and upon their return a&s;cribed the royal clemency to fear, inducing their coun|trymen to believe that the whole kingdom was ready to ri&s;e to vindicate their quarrel. It was in con&s;equence of the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions that
<PB N="301" REF="303">
they determined to &s;end for Perkin to put him&s;elf at their head; and he no &s;ooner made his appearance among them at Bodmin in Cornwall, than the populace, to the number of three thou&s;and men, flocked to his &s;tand|ard. Elated with this appearance of &s;ucce&s;s, he took on him, for the fir&s;t time, the title of Richard the fourth, king of England; and, not to &s;uffer the &s;pirits of his adherents to lan|gui&s;h, he led them to the gates of Exeter. Finding the inhabitants ob&s;tinate in refu&s;ing to admit him, and being unprovided with artil|lery to force an entrance, he re&s;olved to con|tinue before it, until po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;ufficient force to make a farther progre&s;s into the king|dom. In the mean time, Henry being in|formed of his landing and his de&s;igns, ex|pre&s;&s;ed great joy upon the occa&s;ion, declaring that he &s;hould now have the plea&s;ure of an in|terview with a per&s;on whom he long wi&s;hed to &s;ee. All the courtiers &s;en&s;ible of Perkin's de&s;|perate &s;ituation, and the general &s;u&s;picion there was of their own fidelity, prepared them&s;elves to a&s;&s;i&s;t the king with great ala|crity. The lords Daubeny and Broke, the earl of Devon&s;hire, and the duke of Buck|ingham, all appeared at the head of their re|&s;pective forces, and &s;eemed eager for an op|portunity
<PB N="302" REF="304">
of di&s;playing their courage and loy|alty. Perkin being informed of the&s;e great preparations broke up the &s;iege of Exeter, and retired to Taunton. His followers by this time amounted to &s;even thou&s;and men, and appeared ready to defend his cau&s;e; but his heart failed him; and in&s;tead of bringing them into the field, he privately de&s;erted them, and took &s;anctuary in the mona&s;tery of Beau|lieu, in the New Fore&s;t. His wretched ad|herents, left to the king's mercy, found him &s;till willing to pardon; and, except a few of the ring-leaders, none were treated with capi|tal &s;everity. The lady Catharine Gordon, wife to Perkin, fell into the conqueror's hands, and was treated by him with all the lenity due to her &s;ex and quality. She was placed in a reputable &s;tation near the per&s;on of the queen, and a&s;&s;igned a pen&s;ion, which &s;he enjoyed till her death. But the manner in which Perkin him&s;elf was to be treated appeared more doubt|ful. At fir&s;t, it was &s;ugge&s;ted by &s;ome, that he &s;hould be taken forcibly from the &s;anctuary to which he had fled, and made a public ex|ample; but Henry thought that milder me|thods would an&s;wer as well. He therefore employed &s;ome per&s;ons to treat with Perkin, and to per&s;uade him, under promi&s;e of a par|don,
<PB N="303" REF="305">
to deliver him&s;elf up to ju&s;tice, and to confe&s;s and explain all the circum&s;tances of his impo&s;ture. His affairs being altogether de&s;|perate, he embraced the king's offers, with|out he&s;itation, and quitted the &s;anctuary. Henry being de&s;irous of &s;eeing him, he was brought to court, and conducted through the &s;treets of London in a kind of mock triumph, amid&s;t the deri&s;ion and in&s;ults of the popu|lace, which he bore with the mo&s;t dignified re&s;ignation. He was then compelled to &s;ign a confe&s;&s;ion of his former life and conduct, which was printed and di&s;per&s;ed throughout the nation; but it was &s;o defective and con|tradictory, that in&s;tead of explaining the pre|tended impo&s;ture, it left it &s;till more doubtful than before; and this youth's real preten&s;ions are to this very day an object of di&s;pute among the learned. However, though his life was granted him, he was &s;till detained in cu&s;tody, and keepers were appointed to watch over his conduct. But his impatience of any confine|ment could not be controuled; he broke loo&s;e from his keepers, and flying to the &s;anctuary of Shyne, put him&s;elf in the hands of the prior of that mona&s;tery. He was once again prevailed on to tru&s;t him&s;elf to the king's mercy; but in order to reduce him to the low|e&s;t
<PB N="304" REF="306">
&s;tate of contempt, he was &s;et in the &s;tocks at We&s;tmin&s;ter and Cheap&s;ide, and obliged to read aloud, in both places, the confe&s;&s;ion which had been formerly publi&s;hed in his name. From this place of &s;corn, he was conveyed to the Tower, where it was thought the &s;trength of his pri&s;on would be &s;ufficient to re&s;train his re&s;tle&s;s active di&s;po&s;ition; but nothing could re|pre&s;s his habits of inquietude. He had in&s;inu|ated him&s;elf into the intimacy of four &s;ervants of the lieutenant of the Tower; and by their means opened a corre&s;pondence with the un|fortunate Warwick,<MILESTONE N="1499" UNIT="A.D."> who had been confined there for many years before, and kept in a &s;tate of utter ignorance. In all probability Perkin was permitted to enter into this corre|&s;pondence with him by the connivance of the king, who hoped that his enterpri&s;ing genius, and in&s;inuating addre&s;s, would engage the &s;imple Warwick in &s;ome project that would furni&s;h a pretext for taking away their lives, which accordingly happened. Perkin tam|pered with the &s;ervants, who, it is &s;aid, agreed to murder their ma&s;ter, and thus &s;ecure the gates of the Tower, by which the pri&s;oners might make their e&s;cape to &s;ome &s;ecure part of the kingdom.</P>
<P>That the danger might appear more immi|nent and pre&s;&s;ing, &s;o as to ju&s;tify the &s;teps
<PB N="305" REF="307">
which Henry intended to take, another di&s;tur|bance was rai&s;ed at the &s;ame time in Kent, where a young man called Ralph Wilford, the &s;on of a cordwainer, per&s;onated the earl of Warwick, under the conduct and direction of one Patrick, an Augu&s;tine monk, who in his &s;ermons exhorted the people to take arms in his favour. This friar, who had been u&s;ed as a tool by the king's emi&s;&s;aries, was arre&s;ted, to|gether with his pupil; and Wilford was hang|ed without ceremony, but the tutor obtained his pardon. This was the prelude to the fate of Perkin, and the earl of Warwick; the for|mer of whom was tried at We&s;tmin&s;ter; and being convicted on the evidence of the &s;er|vants of the Tower, was hanged at Tyburn with John Walter, mayor of Corke, who had con&s;tantly adhered to his cau&s;e in all the vi|ci&s;&s;itudes of his fortune. Blewet and A&s;twood, two of the &s;ervants, underwent the &s;ame fate; but &s;ix other per&s;ons, condemned as accompli|ces in the &s;ame con&s;piracy, were pardoned. In a few days after Perkin's execution, the wretched earl of Warwick was tried by his peers; and being convicted of high-trea&s;on, in con&s;equence of pleading guilty to the ar|raignment, was beheaded on Tower-Hill, and in him ended the la&s;t male branch of the hou&s;e
<PB N="306" REF="308">
of Plantagenet. The deplorable end of this innocent nobleman, and the fate of Perkin, who, notwith&s;tanding all that appeared again&s;t him, was, by the unprejudiced part of the na|tion, deemed the real &s;on of king Edward, filled the whole kingdom with &s;uch aver&s;ion to the government of king Henry, that to throw the odium from him&s;elf, he was obliged to lay it to the account of his ally, Ferdinand of Arragon, who he &s;aid &s;crupled his alliance, while any prince of the hou&s;e of York remain|ed alive.</P>
<P>There had been hitherto nothing in this reign but plots, trea&s;ons, in&s;urrections, impo&s;|tures, and executions; and it is probable that Henry's &s;everity proceeded from the continual alarms in which they held him. It is certain, that no prince ever loved peace more than he; and much of the ill-will of his &s;ubjects aro&s;e from his attempts to repre&s;s their inclinations for war. The u&s;ual preface to all his treaties was, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That when Chri&s;t came into the world peace was &s;ung; and when he went out of the world peace was bequeathed."</Q> He had no ambition to extend his power, except only by treaties and by wi&s;dom; by the&s;e he render|ed him&s;elf much more formidable to his neigh|bours, than his predece&s;&s;ors had by their vic|tories;
<PB N="307" REF="309">
they became terrible to their own &s;ubjects; he was chiefly dreaded by rival kings.</P>
<P>He had all along two points principally in view; one to depre&s;s the nobility and clergy, and the other to exalt and humanize the popu|lace. From the ambition and turbulence of the former, and from the wretchedne&s;s and credulity of the latter, all the troubles in the former reigns had taken their original. In the feudal times, every nobleman was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a certain number of &s;ubjects, over whom he had an ab&s;olute power; and therefore, upon every &s;light di&s;gu&s;t, he was able to influence them to join him in his revolt or di&s;obedience. Henry, therefore, wi&s;ely con&s;idered, that the giving the&s;e petty tyrants a power of &s;elling their e&s;tates, which before his time were unali|enable, would greatly weaken their intere&s;t. With this view he procured an act, by which the nobility were granted a power of di&s;po&s;ing of their e&s;tates; a law infinitely plea&s;ing to the commons, and not di&s;agreeable even to the nobles, &s;ince they had thus an im|mediate re&s;ource for &s;upplying their ta&s;te for prodigality, and an&s;wering the demands of their creditors. The blow reached them in their po&s;terity alone; but they were too ignorant to be affected by &s;uch di&s;tant di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="310">His next &s;cheme was to prevent their giving liveries to many hundreds of their dependants, who were thus retained to &s;erve their lord, and kept like the &s;oldiers of a &s;tanding army, to be ready at the command of their leader. By an act pa&s;&s;ed in this reign, none but menial &s;ervants, were permitted to wear a livery under &s;evere penalties; and this law was enforced with the mo&s;t punctual ob&s;ervance. The king one day paying a vi&s;it to the earl of Oxford, was entertained by him with all po&s;&s;ible &s;plen|dour and ho&s;pitality. When he was ready to depart, he &s;aw ranged upon both &s;ides a great number of men dre&s;&s;ed up in very rich li|veries, apparently to do him honour. The king, &s;urprized at &s;uch a number of dome&s;tics, as he pretended to &s;uppo&s;e them, a&s;ked lord Oxford whether he entertained &s;uch a large number of dome&s;tics; to which the earl, not perceiving the drift of the que&s;tion, replied, that they were only men whom he kept in pay to do him honour upon &s;uch occa&s;ions. At this the king &s;tarted back, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"By my faith, my lord, I thank you for your good cheer; but I mu&s;t not &s;uffer to have the laws broken before my face; my attorney-general mu&s;t talk with you."</Q> Oxford is &s;aid to have paid no le&s;s than fifteen thou&s;and marks as a compo&s;ition for his offence.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="311">We have already &s;een, in a thou&s;and in|&s;tances, what a perverted u&s;e was made of mo|na&s;teries, and other places appropriated to re|ligious wor&s;hip, by the number of criminals who found &s;anctuary and protection there. This privilege the clergy a&s;&s;umed as their un|doubted right; and tho&s;e places of pretended &s;anctity were now become the abode of mur|derers, robbers, and con&s;pirators. Witches and magicians were the only per&s;ons that were forbid to avail them&s;elves of the &s;ecurity the&s;e &s;anctuaries afforded; and they who&s;e crimes were only fictitious, were the only people who had not the benefit of &s;uch a retreat. Henry u&s;ed all his intere&s;t with the pope to get the&s;e &s;anctuaries aboli&s;hed; but was not able to &s;uc|ceed. All that he could procure was, that if thieves, murderers, or robbers, regi&s;tered as &s;anctuary men, &s;hould &s;ally out, and commit fre&s;h offences, and retreat again, in &s;uch ca&s;es they might be taken out of the &s;anctuary, and delivered up to ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Henry was not remi&s;s in abridging the pope's power, while, at the &s;ame time, he profe&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his commands, and the greate&s;t re&s;pect for the clergy. The pope at one time was &s;o far impo&s;ed upon by his &s;eeming attachment to the church, that he
<PB N="310" REF="312">
even invited him to renew the cru&s;ades for re|covering the Holy Land. Henry's an&s;wer de|&s;erves to be remembered. He a&s;&s;ured his ho|line&s;s that no prince in Chri&s;tendom would be more forward to undertake &s;o glorious and ne|ce&s;&s;ary an expedition; but as his dominions lay very di&s;tant from Con&s;tantinople, it would be better to apply to the kings of France and Spain for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and in the mean time he would go to their aid him&s;elf, as &s;oon as all the differences between the Chri&s;tian princes &s;hould be brought to an end. This was at once a polite refu&s;al, and an oblique reproach.</P>
<P>But while he thus employed his power in low|ering the influence of the nobles and clergy, he was u&s;ing every art to extend the privileges of the people. In former reigns they were &s;ure to &s;uffer on whatever &s;ide they fought, when they were un&s;ucce&s;sful. This rendered each party de&s;perate in a declared civil war, as no hopes of pardon remained, and con&s;e|quently terrible &s;laughters were &s;een to en&s;ue. He therefore procured an act, by which it was e&s;tabli&s;hed, that no per&s;on &s;hould be impeach|ed or attainted for a&s;&s;i&s;ting the king for the time being, or, in other words, the &s;overeign who &s;hould be then actually in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
<PB N="311" REF="313">
throne. This excellent &s;tatute &s;erved to re|pre&s;s the de&s;ire of civil war, as &s;everal would naturally take arms in defence of that &s;ide, on which they were certain of lo&s;ing nothing by a defeat; and numbers would thus &s;erve to in|timidate rebellion. Thus the common people, no longer maintained in vicious idlene&s;s by their &s;uperiors, were obliged to become in|du&s;trious for their &s;upport. The nobility, in|&s;tead of vying with each other in the number and boldne&s;s of their retainers, acquired by de|grees a more civilized &s;pecies of emulation; and endeavoured to excel in the &s;plendour and elegance of their equipages, hou&s;es, and ta|bles. In fact, the king's greate&s;t efforts were directed to promote trade and commerce, be|cau&s;e this naturally introduced a &s;pirit of li|berty among the people, and di&s;engaged them from all dependence, except upon the laws and the king. Before this great aera, all our towns owed their original to &s;ome &s;trong ca&s;tle in the neighbourhood, where &s;ome powerful lord generally re&s;ided. The&s;e were at once fortre&s;&s;es for protection, and pri&s;ons for all &s;orts of criminals. In this ca&s;tle there was u&s;ually a garri&s;on armed and provided, de|pending entirely on the nobleman's &s;upport and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. To the&s;e &s;eats of protection, artifi|cers,
<PB N="312" REF="314">
victuallers, and &s;hop-keepers, naturally re&s;orted, and &s;ettled on &s;ome adjacent &s;pot to furni&s;h the lord and his attendants with all the nece&s;&s;aries they might require. The farmers al&s;o, and the hu&s;bandmen in the neighbour|hood, built their hou&s;es there to be protected again&s;t the numerous gangs of robbers called Robert&s;men, that hid them&s;elves in the woods by day, and infe&s;ted the open country by night. Henry endeavoured to bring the towns from &s;uch a neighbourhood, by inviting the inhabitants to a more commercial &s;ituation. He attempted to teach them frugality, and a ju&s;t payment of debts, by his own example; and never once omitted the rights of the mer|chant, in all his treaties with foreign princes.</P>
<P>But it mu&s;t not be concealed, that from a long contemplation upon the relative advanta|ges of money, he at la&s;t grew into an habit of con&s;idering it as valuable for it&s;elf alone. As he grew old his avarice &s;eemed to predominate over his ambition; and the methods he took to encrea&s;e his trea&s;ures, cannot be ju&s;tified by his mo&s;t ardent admirers. He had found two mini&s;ters, Emp&s;on and Dudley, perfectly qua|lified to &s;econd his avaricious intentions. They were both lawyers; the fir&s;t of mean birth, brutal manners, and an unrelenting temper;
<PB N="313" REF="315">
the &s;econd, better born, and better bred, but equally &s;evere and inflexible. It was their u&s;ual practice to commit, by indictment, &s;uch per&s;ons to pri&s;on as they intended to oppre&s;s; from whence they &s;eldom got free, but by pay|ing heavy fines, which were called mitigations and compo&s;itions. By degrees, as they were grown more hardened in oppre&s;&s;ion, the very forms of law were omitted; they determined in a &s;ummary way upon the properties of the &s;ubject, and confi&s;cated their effects to the royal trea&s;ury. But the chief in&s;truments of oppre&s;&s;ion employed by the&s;e mini&s;ters were the penal &s;tatutes, which, without con&s;idera|tion of rank, quality, or &s;ervices, were rigidly put in execution again&s;t all men.</P>
<P>In this manner, was the latter part of this active monarch's reign employed in &s;chemes to &s;trengthen the power of the crown, by ama&s;&s;ing money, and extending that of the people. He had the &s;atisfaction about that time of comple|ting a marriage between Arthur,<MILESTONE N="1500" UNIT="A.D."> the Prince of Wales, and the Infanta Catharine of Spain, which had been projected and negotiated du|ring the cour&s;e of &s;even years. But this mar|riage proved, in the event, unpro&s;perous. The young prince &s;ickened and died in a few months after, very much regretted by the
<PB N="314" REF="316">
whole nation; and the prince&s;s was obliged &s;hortly after to marry his &s;econd &s;on Henry, who was created Prince of Wales in the room of his brother. The prince him&s;elf made all the oppo&s;ition which a youth of twelve years of age was capable of; but as the king per&s;i&s;t|ed in his re&s;olution, the marriage was, by the pope's di&s;pen&s;ation, &s;hortly after &s;olemnized.</P>
<P>The magnificence of the&s;e nuptials was &s;oon after eclip&s;ed by the accidental arrival of Philip, the arch-duke of Ca&s;tile, with Joan his con&s;ort. The&s;e per&s;onages had embarked for Spain during the winter &s;ea&s;on, in order to take the advantage of an invitation, which the people of that country had offered to place them upon the Spani&s;h throne. Meeting, how|ever, with a violent tempe&s;t in their voyage, they were obliged to take &s;helter in Weymouth harbour, where they were honourably received by Sir John Trenchard, a gentleman of autho|rity in the county of Dor&s;et.<MILESTONE N="1506" UNIT="A.D."> The king &s;oon after being informed of their arrival, &s;ent in all ha&s;te the earl of Arundel to compliment them on their &s;afe e&s;cape; and to inform them that he intended &s;hortly paying them a vi&s;it in per|&s;on. Philip knew that this was but a polite method of detaining him; and, for the &s;ake of di&s;patch, he re&s;olved to anticipate his vi&s;it, and
<PB N="315" REF="317">
to have an interview with him at Wind&s;or. Henry received him with all the magnificence po&s;&s;ible, and with all &s;eeming cordiality; but was re&s;olved to reimbur&s;e him&s;elf for the ex|pence of his pageants, by advantages that would be more &s;ub&s;tantially conducive to his own intere&s;ts, and tho&s;e of the nation. There had been &s;ome years before a plot carried on again&s;t him by the earl of Suffolk; for which Sir James Tyrrel, and Sir James Windham, had been condemned and executed, while Suf|folk, the original contriver, had made his e&s;|cape into the Low Countries, where he found protection from Philip. But he was now given up at Henry's reque&s;t, and being brought over to England, he was impri&s;oned in the Tower. A treaty of commerce was al&s;o agreed upon between the two &s;overeigns; which was at that time of the greate&s;t benefit to England, and continues to remain as the ground work of all other commercial treaties to this day.</P>
<P>Henry having thus &s;een England in a great mea&s;ure civilized by his endeavours, his people pay their taxes without con&s;traint, the nobles confe&s;&s;ing a ju&s;t &s;ubordination, the laws alone inflicting puni&s;hment, the towns beginning to live independant of the powerful, commerce every day encrea&s;ing, the &s;pirit of faction ex|tingui&s;hed,
<PB N="316" REF="318">
and foreigners either fearing Eng|land or &s;eeking its alliance, he began to per|ceive the approaches of his end. He then re|&s;olved to reconcile him&s;elf to heaven; and by di&s;tributing alms, founding religious hou&s;es, and granting a general pardon to all his &s;ub|jects, to make an atonement for the errors of his reign. It was in this di&s;po&s;ition that he died of the gout in his &s;tomach,<MILESTONE N="1509" UNIT="A.D."> having lived fifty-two years and reigned twenty-three. Since the times of Alfred, England had not &s;een &s;uch another king. He rendered his &s;ub|jects powerful and happy, and wrought a greater change in the manners of the people, than it was po&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e could be affect|ed in &s;o &s;hort a time. If he had any fault that de&s;erves to be marked with reproach, it was that having begun his reign with oecono|my, as he grew old his de&s;ires &s;eemed to change their object from the u&s;e of money, to the plea&s;ure of hoarding it. But he ought in this to be pardoned, as he only &s;aved for the public; the royal coffers being then the only trea&s;ury of the &s;tate; and in proportion to the king's finances, the public might be &s;aid to be either rich or indigent.</P>
<P>About this time all Europe, as well as England, &s;eemed to rou&s;e from the long le|thargy,
<PB N="317" REF="319">
during which it continued for above twelve hundred years. France, Spain, Portu|gal, and Sweden enjoyed excellent monarchs; who encouraged and protected the ri&s;ing arts, and &s;pread the means of happine&s;s. The Por|tugue&s;e &s;ailed round the Cape of Good Hope, under the command of Va&s;quez de Gama; and the Spaniards, under the conduct of Columbus, had made the di&s;covery of the new world of America. It was by accident only, that Henry had not a con&s;iderable &s;hare in the&s;e great naval di&s;coveries; for Columbus, after meet|ing with many repul&s;es, from the courts of Portugal and Spain, &s;ent his brother Bartholo|mew into England in order to explain his pro|jects to the king, and to crave his protection for the execution of them. Henry invited Co|lumbus to England; but his brother in return|ing being taken by pirates, was detained in his voyage, and Columbus in the mean time, &s;ucceeding with I&s;abella, happily effected his enterprize. Henry was not di&s;couraged by this di&s;appointment; he fitted out Seba&s;tian Cabot, a Venetian dwelling at Bri&s;tol, and &s;ent him we&s;tward in &s;earch of new countries.<MILESTONE N="1498" UNIT="A.D."> This adventurer di&s;covered the main land of Ame|rica to the North; then &s;ailed Southward along the coa&s;t, and di&s;covered Newfoundland and
<PB N="318" REF="320">
other countries; but returned without making any &s;ettlement. The king, &s;oon after, expend|ed fourteen thou&s;and pounds in building one &s;hip, called the GREAT HARRY. This was, properly &s;peaking, the fir&s;t &s;hip in the Engli&s;h navy. Before this period, when the king wanted a fleet, he had no other expedient but to hire &s;hips from the merchants.</P>

</FIGURE>CHAP. XXIII. HENRY VIII.</HEAD>
<P>NO prince ever came to the throne with a conjuncture of circum&s;tances more in his favour than Henry VIII. who now,<MILESTONE N="1509" UNIT="A.D."> in the eighteenth year of his age, undertook the government of the kingdom. His prudent father left him a peaceful throne, a well &s;tored trea&s;ury, and an undi&s;puted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. By his father's &s;ide he claimed from the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, and
<PB N="320" REF="322">
by his mother's, from that of York. He was in friend&s;hip with all the powers of Europe, and his &s;ubjects were every day growing more powerful and more wealthy; commerce and arts had for &s;ome time been introduced into the kingdom, and the Engli&s;h &s;eemed willing to give them a favourable reception. The young king him&s;elf was beautiful in per&s;on, expert in polite exerci&s;es, open and liberal in his air, and loved by all his &s;ubjects. The old king, who was him&s;elf a &s;cholar, had him in&s;tructed in all the learning of the times; &s;o that he was an adept in &s;chool-divinity before the age of eighteen.</P>
<P>But favourable as the&s;e circum&s;tances were, Henry &s;oon &s;hewed that they went but a &s;hort way in forming a good character, they were merely the gifts of nature, or accompli&s;hments, implanted by the a&s;&s;iduity of his father; but he wanted the more &s;olid advantages, which were to be of his own formation, a good heart, and a &s;ound under&s;tanding. The learning he had, if it may de&s;erve that appellation, &s;erved only to enflame his pride, but not control his vicious affections; the love of his &s;ubjects broke out in their flattery, and this was another meteor to lead him a&s;tray. His va&s;t wealth, in&s;tead of relieving the public, or encrea&s;ing
<PB N="321" REF="323">
his power, only contributed to &s;upply his de|baucheries, or gratify the rapacity of the mi|ni&s;ters of his plea&s;ures. But it had been hap|py for his people if his faults had re&s;ted here; he was a tyrant, humanity takes the alarm at his cruelties; and however fortunate &s;ome of his mea&s;ures might prove in the event, no good man but mu&s;t revolt at his motives, and the means he took for their accompli&s;hment.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t action which &s;hewed that the pre|&s;ent reign was to be very different from the former, was the puni&s;hment of Emp&s;on and Dudley, who were obnoxious to the populace for having been the ready in&s;truments of the late king's rapacity. They were immediately cited before the council, in order to an&s;wer for their conduct; but Emp&s;on, in his defence, alledged that &s;o far from de&s;erving cen&s;ure for his pa&s;t conduct, he was confident his actions rather merited reward and approbation. Tho' a &s;trict execution of the law was the crime of which he and Dudley were accu&s;ed; although the&s;e laws had been e&s;tabli&s;hed by the volun|tary con&s;ent of the people; notwith&s;tanding all their expo&s;tulations, Emp&s;on and Dudley were &s;ent to the Tower, and &s;oon after brought to their trial. As the &s;trict di&s;charge of their duty, in executing the laws, could not be al|ledged
<PB N="322" REF="324">
again&s;t them as a crime, to gratify the people with their puni&s;hment, they were accu&s;|ed of having entered into a con&s;piracy again&s;t the pre&s;ent king; and of intentions to &s;eize, by force, the admini&s;tration of government. Nothing could be more improbable and un|&s;upported than &s;uch a charge; neverthele&s;s the jury were &s;o far infected with popular preju|dice, that they gave a verdict again&s;t them, and they were both executed, &s;ome time after, by a warrant from the king.</P>
<P>This mea&s;ure, which betrayed an unju&s;t compliance with popular clamour, was followed by another &s;till more detrimental to the na|tion, although &s;till more plea&s;ing to the people. Julius the &s;econd was at that time pope, and had filled all Europe with his intrigues and ambition; but his chief re&s;entment was levell|ed again&s;t Lewis, king of France, who was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome valuable provinces of Italy, from which he hoped, by his intrigues, to re|move him. For this purpo&s;e he entered into a treaty with Ferdinand, king of Spain, and Henry of England; to each of whom he of|fered &s;uch advantages as were mo&s;t likely to enflame their ambition, in ca&s;e they fell upon Lewis on their re&s;pective quarters; while he undertook him&s;elf to find him employment in
<PB N="323" REF="325">
Italy. Henry, who had no other motives but the glory of the expedition, and the hopes of receiving the title of the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, which the pope a&s;&s;ured him would &s;oon be wre&s;ted from Lewis, to be conferred upon him, readily undertook to defend his cau&s;e; and his parliament being &s;ummoned, as rea|dily granted &s;upplies for a purpo&s;e &s;o much favoured by the people. The &s;pirit of chival|ry and foreign conque&s;t was not yet quite ex|tingui&s;hed in England; the kingdom of France was &s;till an object they de&s;ired to po&s;&s;e&s;s, and Henry, in compliance with their wi&s;hes, gave out that he intended &s;triking for the crown. It was in vain that one of his old prudent coun&s;ellors objected, that conque&s;ts on the con|tinent would only drain the kingdom, without enriching it; and that England, from its &s;itua|tion, was not fitted to enjoy exten&s;ive empire: the young king, deaf to all remon&s;trances, and burning with military ardour, re&s;olved to undertake the war. The marquis of Dor&s;et was fir&s;t &s;ent over, with a large body of forces, to Fontarabia, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the operations of Fer|dinand; but that faithle&s;s and crafty monarch had no intentions of effectually &s;econding their attempts, wherefore they were obliged to re|turn home without effect.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="326">A con&s;iderable fleet was equipped, &s;ome time after,<MILESTONE N="1513" UNIT="A.D."> to annoy the enemy by &s;ea, and the command entru&s;ted to Sir Edward Howard; who, after &s;couring the Channel for &s;ome time, pre&s;ented him&s;elf before Bre&s;t, where the French navy lay, and challenged them to com|bat. As the French were unequal to the ene|my, they determined to wait for a reinforce|ment, which they expected under the command of Prejeant de Bidoux, from the Mediterra|nean. But in this the gallant Howard was re&s;olved to di&s;appoint them; and, upon the ap|pearance of Prejeant with &s;ix gallies, who had time to take refuge behind &s;ome batteries, which were planted on the rocks that lay on each &s;ide him; he boldly rowed up with two gallies, followed by barges filled with officers of di&s;tinction. Upon coming up to Prejeant's &s;hip, he immediately fa&s;ten|ed upon it, and leaped on board, followed by one Carroz, a Spani&s;h cavalier, and &s;even|teen Engli&s;hmen. The cable, mean while, which fa&s;tened both &s;hips together, was cut by the enemy, and the admiral was thus left in the hands of the French; but as he &s;till continued to fight with great gallantry, he was pu&s;hed over board by their pikes, and peri&s;hed in the &s;ea. Upon his misfortune the
<PB N="325" REF="327">
fleet retired from before Bre&s;t, and the French navy, for a while, kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ea.</P>
<P>This &s;light repul&s;e, only &s;erved to enflame the king's ardour to take revenge upon the enemy; and he &s;oon after &s;ent a body of eight thou&s;and men to Calais, under the command of the earl of Shrew&s;bury; and another body of &s;ix thou&s;and followed &s;hortly after, under the conduct of lord Herbert. He prepared to follow him&s;elf with the main body and rear, and arrived at Calais, attended by numbers of the Engli&s;h nobility. But he &s;oon had an at|tendant, who did him &s;till more honour. This was no le&s;s a per&s;onage than Maximilian, em|peror of Germany, who had &s;tipulated to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with eight thou&s;and men; but being un|able to perform his engagements, joined the Engli&s;h army with &s;ome German and Flemi&s;h &s;oldiers, who were u&s;eful in giving an example of di&s;cipline to Henry's new levied &s;oldiers. He even enli&s;ted him&s;elf in the Engli&s;h &s;ervice, wore the cro&s;s of St. George, and received pay, an hundred crowns a day, as one of Henry's &s;ubjects and captains.</P>
<P>Henry being now at the head of a formid|able army, fifty thou&s;and &s;trong, it was &s;up|po&s;ed that France mu&s;t fall a victim to his am|bition. But that kingdom was not threatened
<PB N="326" REF="328">
by him alone; the Swi&s;s, on another quarter, with twenty-five thou&s;and men, were prepar|ing to invade it; while Ferdinand of Arragon, whom no treaties could bind, was only waiting for a convenient opportunity of attack on his &s;ide to advantage. Never was the French monarchy in &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ed a &s;ituation; but the errors of its a&s;&s;ailants procured its &s;afety. The Swi&s;s entered into a treaty with Tremouille, the French general, who gave them their own terms, &s;atisfied that his ma&s;ter would re&s;cind them all, as not having given him any powers to treat; Ferdinand continued to remain a quiet &s;pectator, vainly waiting for &s;ome effec|tual blow to be &s;truck by his allies; and Hen|ry &s;pent his time in the &s;iege of towns, which could neither &s;ecure his conque&s;ts, or advance his reputation.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e were Terouanne, a little town &s;ituated on the frontiers of Picardy, which kept him employed for more than a month, although the garri&s;on &s;carce amounted to a thou&s;and men. The be&s;ieged, after &s;ome time, falling &s;hort of provi&s;ions, a very bold and de&s;perate attempt was made to &s;upply them, which was attended with &s;ucce&s;s. A French captain, who&s;e name was Fontrailles, led up a body of eighteen hundred men, each
<PB N="327" REF="329">
of whom carried a bag of gunpowder, and two quarters of bacon behind him. With this &s;mall force he made a fierce and unexpected irruption into the Engli&s;h camp; and, &s;ur|mounting all re&s;i&s;tance, advanced to the ditch of the town, where each hor&s;eman threw down his burthen. Then immediately returning up|on the gallop, they were again &s;o fortunate as to break through the Engli&s;h, without any great lo&s;s in the undertaking. But the party of hor&s;e that was &s;ent to cover the retreat, was not &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful. Though this body of troops was commanded by the bolde&s;t and brave&s;t cap|tains of the French army, yet, on &s;ight of the Engli&s;h, they were &s;eized with &s;uch an account|able panic, that they immediately fled, and had many of their be&s;t officers taken pri&s;oners. This action was called by the French the bat|tle of Guinegate, from the place where it was fought; but by the Engli&s;h the battle of the Spurs, as the French, upon that day, made more u&s;e of their &s;purs than their &s;words, to procure &s;afety.</P>
<P>After this victory, which might have been followed with very important con&s;equences, had the victors marched forward to Paris, Henry &s;at down to make &s;ure of the little town, which had made &s;uch an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance;
<PB N="328" REF="330">
and found him&s;elf, when it was obliged to &s;ur|render, ma&s;ter of a place, which neither recom|penced the blood, nor the delay that were ex|pended in the &s;iege.</P>
<P>From one error Henry went on to another. He was per&s;uaded to lay &s;iege to Tournay, a great and rich city of Flanders, which at that time was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the French. This &s;iege, though it took up little time, yet &s;erved to retard the great object, which was the conque&s;t of France; and Henry hearing that the Swi&s;s were returned home, and being elated with his trifling &s;ucce&s;&s;es, re&s;olved to tran&s;port his army back to England, where flattery was put to the torture, to make him happy in the glory of his ridiculous expedi|tion. A truce was concluded &s;oon after be|tween the two kingdoms; and Henry conti|nued to di&s;&s;ipate, in more peaceful follies, tho&s;e immen&s;e &s;ums, which had been ama&s;&s;ed by his predece&s;&s;or for very different purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s which, during his foreign ex|pedition, attended his arms in the North of England, was much more important and de|ci&s;ive. A war having been declared between the Engli&s;h and Scots, who ever took the opportunity to fall on, when their neighbours were embroiled with France, the king of that
<PB N="329" REF="331">
country &s;ummoned out the whole force of his kingdom; and having pa&s;&s;ed the Tweed with a body of fifty thou&s;and men, ravaged tho&s;e parts of Northumberland which lay along the banks of that river. But as his forces were numerous, and the country barren, he &s;oon began to want provi&s;ions; &s;o that many of his men de&s;erting, returned to their native coun|try. In the mean time, the earl of Surry, at the head of twenty-&s;ix thou&s;and men, ap|proached the Scotch, who were encamped on a ri&s;ing ground, near the hills of Cheviot. The river Till ran between both armies, and prevented an engagement; wherefore the earl of Surry &s;ent an herald to the Scotch camp, challenging the enemy to de&s;cend into the plain, which lay to the &s;outh, and there to try their valour on equal ground. This offer not being accepted, he made a feint, as if he in|tended marching away towards Berwick, which putting the Scotch in motion to annoy his rear, he took advantage of a great &s;moke, cau&s;ed by the firing their huts, and pa&s;&s;ed the little river, which had hitherto prevented the engagement. Both armies now perceiving that a combat was inevitable, they prepared for the on&s;et with great compo&s;ure and regularity. The Engli&s;h divided their army into two lines;
<PB N="330" REF="332">
lord Howard led the main body of the fir&s;t line; Sir Edmond Howard the right wing, and Sir Marmaduke Con&s;table the left; the earl of Surry him&s;elf commanded the main body of the &s;econd line, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by lord Da|cres, and Sir Edward Stanley, to the right and the left. The Scots, on the other hand, pre|&s;ented three divi&s;ions to the enemy; the mid|dle commanded by the king him&s;elf, the right by the earl of Huntley, and the left by the earls of Lenox and Argyle; a fourth divi&s;ion, under the earl of Bothwell, made a body of re&s;erve. Lord Huntley began the on&s;et, charg|ing the divi&s;ion of lord Howard with &s;uch fury, that it was immediately put to confu&s;ion, and routed. But this divi&s;ion was &s;o &s;ea&s;on|ably &s;upported by lord Dacres, that the men rallied, and the battle became general. Both &s;ides fought a long time with incredible impe|tuo&s;ity, until the Highlanders, being galled by the Engli&s;h artillery, broke in &s;word in hand upon the main body, commanded by the earl of Surry; and at the head of the&s;e, James fought with the mo&s;t forward of the nobility. They attacked with &s;uch velocity, that the hinder line could not advance in time to &s;u&s;|tain them, &s;o that a body of Engli&s;h inter|cepted their retreat. James being thus almo&s;t
<PB N="331" REF="333">
&s;urrounded by the enemy, refu&s;ed to quit the field, while it was yet in his power; but, alight|ing from his hor&s;e, formed his little body into an orb, and in this po&s;ture fought with &s;uch de&s;perate courage, as re&s;tored the battle. The Engli&s;h, therefore, were again obliged to have recour&s;e to their artillery and arrows, which made a terrible havock; but night &s;eparating the combatants, it was not till the day follow|ing that lord Howard perceived that he had gained a great and glorious victory. The Engli&s;h had lo&s;t no per&s;ons of note, but the whole flower of the Scotch nobility were fallen in battle. Ten thou&s;and of the common men were cut off, and a body, &s;uppo&s;ed to be that of the king, was &s;ent to London, where it re|mained unburied, as a &s;entence of excommuni|cation &s;till remained again&s;t James, for having leagued with France again&s;t the Holy See. But upon Henry's application, who pretended that that prince in the in&s;tant before his death had di&s;covered &s;ome &s;igns of repentance, ab|&s;olution was given him, and the body was in|terred. However, the populace of Scotland &s;till continued to think their king alive; and it was given out among them that he had &s;e|cretly gone on a pilgrimage to Jeru&s;alem.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="334">The&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es only &s;erved to intoxicate Henry &s;till the more; and while his plea&s;ures, on the one hand, engro&s;&s;ed his time, the pre|parations for repeated expeditions exhau&s;ted his trea&s;ures. As it was natural to &s;uppo&s;e the old mini&s;ters, who were appointed to di|rect him by his father, would not willingly concur in the&s;e idle projects, Henry had, for &s;ome time, di&s;continued a&s;king their advice, and chiefly confided in the coun&s;els of Thomas, afterwards cardinal Wol&s;ey, who &s;eemed to &s;e|cond him in his favourite pur&s;uits. Wol&s;ey was a mini&s;ter who complied with all his ma&s;ter's in|clinations, and flattered him in every &s;cheme to which his &s;anguine and impetuous temper was inclined. He was the &s;on of a private gentleman, and not of a butcher, as is com|monly reported, of Ip&s;wich. He was &s;ent to Oxford &s;o early, that he was a bachelor at fourteen, and at that time was called the boy bachelor. He ro&s;e by degrees, upon quit|ting college, from one preferment to another, till he was made rector of Lymington by the marquis of Dor&s;et, who&s;e children he had in&s;tructed. He had not long re&s;ided at this living, when one of the ju&s;tices of the peace put him in the &s;tocks for being drunk, and rai&s;ing di&s;turbances at a neighbouring fair.
<PB N="333" REF="335">
This di&s;grace, however, did not retard his pro|motion; for he was recommended as chaplain to Henry the &s;eventh; and being employed by that monarch in a &s;ecret negotiation re|&s;pecting his intended marriage with Margaret of Savoy, he acquitted him&s;elf to that king's &s;atisfaction, and obtained the prai&s;e both of diligence and dexterity. That prince having given him a commi&s;&s;ion to Maximilian, who at that time re&s;ided at Bru&s;&s;els, was &s;urpri&s;ed in le&s;s than three days after to &s;ee Wol&s;ey pre|&s;ent him&s;elf before him; and, &s;uppo&s;ing that he had been delinquent, began to reprove his delay. Wol&s;ey, however, &s;urpri&s;ed him with a&s;&s;urances that he was ju&s;t returned from Bru&s;|&s;els, and had &s;ucce&s;sfully fulfilled all his ma|je&s;ty's commands. His di&s;patch on that occa|&s;ion procured him the deanery of Lincoln, and in this &s;ituation it was that he was intro|duced by Fox, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, to the young king's notice, in hopes that he would have talents to &s;upplant the earl of Surry, who was favourite at that time, and in this Fox was not out in his conjectures. Pre&s;ently af|ter, being introduced at court, he was made a privy-coun&s;ellor; and as &s;uch, had frequent opportunities of ingratiating him&s;elf with the young king, as he appeared at once complying,
<PB N="334" REF="336">
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, and enterprizing. Wol&s;ey u&s;ed every art to &s;uit him&s;elf to the royal temper; he &s;ung, laughed, and danced with every liber|tine of the court; neither his own years, which were near forty, nor his character of a clergyman, were any re&s;traint upon him, or tended to check, by ill-timed &s;everities, the gaiety of his companions. To &s;uch a weak and vicious monarch as Henry, qualities of this nature were highly plea&s;ing; and Wol&s;ey was &s;oon acknowledged as his chief favourite, and to him was entru&s;ted the chief admini|&s;tration of affairs. The people began to &s;ee with indignation the new favourite's mean con|de&s;cen&s;ions to the king, and his arrogance to them&s;elves. They had long regarded the vi|cious haughtine&s;s, and the unbecoming &s;plen|dour of the clergy, with envy and dete&s;tation; and Wol&s;ey's greatne&s;s &s;erved to bring a new odium upon that body, already too much the object of the people's di&s;like. His character being now placed in a more con&s;picuous point of light, daily began to manife&s;t it&s;elf the more. In&s;atiable in his acqui&s;itions, but &s;till more magnificent in his expence; of exten&s;ive capa|city, but &s;till more unbounded in enterprize; ambitious of power, but &s;till more de&s;irous of glory; in&s;inuating, engaging, per&s;ua&s;ive, and
<PB N="335" REF="337">
at other times lofty, elevated, and command|ing: haughty to his equals, but affable to his dependents; oppre&s;&s;ive to the people, but liberal to his friends; more generous than grateful; formed to take the a&s;cendant in every intercour&s;e, but vain enough not to cover his real &s;uperiority.</P>
<P>He had been advanced &s;oon to the bi&s;hopric of Lincoln; but this he afterwards re&s;igned,<MILESTONE N="1515" UNIT="A.D."> upon being promoted to the archbi&s;hopric of York. Upon the capture of Tournay, he had been promoted to the &s;ee of that place; but be&s;ides, he got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion at very low lea&s;es of the revenues of Bath, Worce&s;ter, and Here|ford, bi&s;hoprics filled by Italians, who were al|lowed to re&s;ide abroad, and who were glad to compound for this indulgence, by parting with a con&s;iderable &s;hare of their profits. Be&s;ides many other church preferments, he was allow|ed to unite with the &s;ee of York, fir&s;t that of Durham, next that of Winche&s;ter; and his appetite &s;eemed to encrea&s;e, by the means that were taken to &s;atisfy it. The pope, ob&s;erving his great influence over the king, was de&s;irous of engaging him in his intere&s;ts, and created him a cardinal. His train con&s;i&s;ted of eight hundred &s;ervants, of whom many were knights and gentlemen. Some, even of the nobility,
<PB N="336" REF="338">
put their children into his family as a place of education; and whoever was di&s;tingui&s;hed by any art or &s;cience, paid court to the cardinal, and were often liberally rewarded. He was the fir&s;t clergyman in England who wore &s;ilk and gold, not only on his habit, but al&s;o on his &s;addles and the trappings of his hor&s;es.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the&s;e various di&s;tinctions the pope &s;oon after conferred upon him that of legate, de&s;ign|ing thus to make him in&s;trumental in draining the kingdom of money, upon pretence of em|ploying it in a war again&s;t the Turks, but in reality with a view to fill his own coffers. In this he &s;o well &s;erved the court of Rome, that &s;ome time after the po&s;t of legate was conferred up|on him for life; and he now united in his per&s;on the promotions of legate, cardinal, archbi&s;hop, and prime mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>Soon after, Warham, chancellor, and arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury, a man of a very mo|derate temper, cho&s;e rather to retire from pub|lic employment, than maintain an unequal conte&s;t with the haughty cardinal. Wol&s;ey in&s;tantly &s;eized on the chancellor&s;hip, and ex|erci&s;ed the duties of that employment with great abilities and impartiality. The duke of Norfolk finding the king's trea&s;ures exhau&s;ted, and his ta&s;te for expence &s;till continuing, was
<PB N="337" REF="339">
glad to re&s;ign his office of trea&s;urer, and retire from court. Fox, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, who had fir&s;t been in&s;trumental in Wol&s;ey's ri&s;e, withdrew him&s;elf in di&s;gu&s;t; the duke of Suf|folk al&s;o went home with a re&s;olution to re|main private, whil&s;t Wol&s;ey availed him&s;elf of their di&s;contents, and filled up their places by his creatures, or his per&s;onal a&s;&s;iduity. The&s;e were va&s;t &s;tretches of power; and yet the churchman was &s;till in&s;atiable. He procur|ed a bull from the pope, empowering him to make knights and counts, to legitimate ba&s;|tards, to give degrees in arts, law, phy&s;ic, and divinity; and to grant all &s;orts of di&s;pen&s;ations. So much pride and power could not avoid giving high offence to the nobility, yet none dared vent their indignation, &s;o greatly were they in terror of his vindictive temper.</P>
<P>In order to divert their envy from his inordinate exaltation, he &s;oon entered into a corre&s;pondence with Francis the fir&s;t, of France, who had taken many methods to work upon his vanity, and at la&s;t &s;ucceeded. In con&s;equence of that monarch's wi&s;hes, Henry was per&s;uaded by the cardinal to deliver up Tournay once more to the French; and he al&s;o agreed to an interview with that monarch. This expen&s;ive congre&s;s was held between
<PB N="338" REF="340">
Gui&s;nes and Ardres, near Calais; within the Engli&s;h pale, in compliment to Henry for cro&s;|&s;ing the &s;ea. The two monarchs, after &s;alut|ing each other in the mo&s;t cordial manner, retired into a tent erected for the purpo&s;e, where Henry proceeded to read the articles of their intended alliance. As he began to read the fir&s;t words of it, <Q REND="inline">"I, Henry, king,"</Q> he &s;topt a moment; and then &s;ubjoined only <Q REND="inline">"of England,"</Q> without adding France, the u&s;ual &s;tyle of Engli&s;h monarchs. Francis remarked this delicacy, and expre&s;&s;ed his approbation by a &s;mile. Nothing could exceed the magnifi|cence of the nobility of both courts on this oc|ca&s;&s;on. Many of them involved them&s;elves in large debts; and the penury of a life was &s;carce &s;ufficient to reimbur&s;e the extravagance of a few days. Be&s;ide, there at fir&s;t appeared &s;ome|thing low and illiberal in the mutual di&s;tru&s;ts that were con&s;picuous on this occa&s;ion; the two kings never met without having the num|ber of their guards counted on both &s;ides; every &s;tep was carefully adju&s;ted; they pa&s;&s;ed each other in the middle-point between both places, when they went to vi&s;it their queens; and at the &s;ame in&s;tant that Henry entered Ardres, Francis put him&s;elf into the hands of the Engli&s;h at Gui&s;nes. But Francis, who is
<PB N="339" REF="341">
con&s;idered as the fir&s;t re&s;torer of true polite|ne&s;s into Europe, put an end to this low and illiberal method of conver&s;ing. Taking one day with him two gentlemen and a page, he rode directly into Gui&s;nes, crying out to the Engli&s;h guards that they were their pri&s;oners, and de&s;iring to be carried to their ma&s;ter. Hen|ry was not a little a&s;toni&s;hed at the appear|ance of Francis; and taking him in his arms, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My brother, &s;aid he, you have here given me the mo&s;t agreeable &s;urpri&s;e; you have &s;hewn me the full confidence I may place in you; I &s;urrender my&s;elf your pri&s;oner from this moment."</Q> He then took from his neck a collar of pearls of great value, and putting it on Francis, begged him to wear it for the &s;ake of his pri&s;oner. Francis agreed; and giving him a bracelet of double the value of the former, in&s;i&s;ted on his wearing it in turn. Henry went the next day to Ardres, without guards or attendants; and confidence being now &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed between the&s;e mon|archs, they employed the re&s;t of the time in fea&s;ts and tournaments.</P>
<P>Some months before a defiance had been &s;ent by the two kings to each other's court,<MILESTONE N="1520" UNIT="A.D."> and through all the chief cities of Europe, importing, that Henry and Francis, with four|teen
<PB N="340" REF="342">
aids, would be ready in the plains of Picardy to an&s;wer all comers that were gentle|men, at tilt and tourney. Accordingly, the monarchs, now all gorgeou&s;ly apparelled, en|tered the li&s;ts on hor&s;eback, Francis &s;urround|ed with Henry's guards, and Henry with tho&s;e of Francis. They were both at that time the mo&s;t comely per&s;onages of their age, and pri|ded them&s;elves on their expertne&s;s in the mili|tary execi&s;es. The ladies were the judges in the&s;e feats of chivalry; and they put an end to the encounter whenever they thought proper. It is &s;uppo&s;ed that the crafty French monarch was willing to gratify Henry's vanity by allow|ing him to enjoy a petty pre-eminence in the&s;e pa&s;times. He ran a tilt again&s;t Mon&s;ieur Grandeval, whom he di&s;abled at the &s;econd encounter. He engaged Mon&s;ieur de Mont|morency, whom, however, he could not throw from the &s;addle. He fought at faulchion with a French nobleman, who pre&s;ented him with his cour&s;er, in token of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But the&s;e empty &s;plendours were not &s;uffi|cient to appea&s;e the jealou&s;y of the nobles at home, or quiet the murmurs of the people. Among the&s;e, the duke of Buckingham, the &s;on of him who lo&s;t his life in the reign of Richard the third, was the foremo&s;t to com|plain.
<PB N="341" REF="343">
He had often been heard to treat the cardinal's pride and profu&s;ion with ju&s;t con|tempt; and carrying his re&s;entment perhaps to an improper length, &s;ome low informers took care that Wol&s;ey &s;hould be apprized of all. The &s;ub&s;tance of his impeachment was, that he had con&s;ulted a fortune-teller concern|ing his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown, and had affect|ed to make him&s;elf popular. This was but a weak pretext to take away the life of a no|bleman, who&s;e father had died in defence of the late king; but he was brought to a trial, and the duke of Norfolk, who&s;e &s;on had mar|ried his daughter, was created lord &s;teward, to pre&s;ide at this &s;olemn procedure. He was con|demned to die, as a traitor, by a jury, con&s;i&s;t|ing of a duke, a marquis, &s;even earls, and twelve barons. When the &s;entence was pro|nouncing again&s;t him, and the high &s;teward came to mention the word traitor, the unhap|py pri&s;oner could not contain his indignation. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My lords, cried he to the judges, I am no traitor; and for what you have now done again&s;t me, take my &s;incere forgivene&s;s; as for my life, I think it not worth petitioning for; may God forgive you, and pity me."</Q> He was &s;oon after executed on Tower-Hill.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="344">By this time, all the immen&s;e trea&s;ures of the late king were quite exhau&s;ted on empty pageants, guilty plea&s;ures, or vain treaties and expeditions. But the king relied on Wol&s;ey alone for repleni&s;hing his coffers; and no per|&s;on could be fitter for the purpo&s;e. His fir&s;t care was to get a large &s;um of money from the people, under the title of a benevolence, which added to its being extorted the morti|fication of being con&s;idered as a free gift. Henry little minded the manner of its being rai&s;ed, provided he had the enjoyment of it; however, his mini&s;ter met with &s;ome oppo&s;i|tion in his attempts to levy the&s;e extorted con|tributions. In the fir&s;t place, having exacted a con&s;iderable &s;ub&s;idy from the clergy, he next adre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the hou&s;e of commons; but they only granted him half the &s;upplies he demanded. Wol&s;ey was at fir&s;t highly of|fended at their par&s;imony, and de&s;ired to be heard in the hou&s;e; but as this would have de&s;troyed the very form and con&s;titution of that augu&s;t body, they replied, that none could be permitted to &s;it and argue there, but &s;uch as had been elected members. This was the fir&s;t attempt made in this reign, to render the king ma&s;ter of the debates in parliament. Wol&s;ey fir&s;t paved the way; and, unfortunate|ly
<PB N="343" REF="345">
for the kingdom, Henry too well improved upon his plans &s;oon after.</P>
<P>A treaty with France, which threatened to make a breach with the emperor, induced Henry to wi&s;h for new &s;upplies, or at lea&s;t he made this the pretext of his demands. But as the parliament had te&s;tified their reluctance to indulge his wi&s;hes, he followed the advice of Wol&s;ey, and re&s;olved to make u&s;e of his prerogative alone for that purpo&s;e. He i&s;&s;ued out commi&s;&s;ions to all the counties of England for levying four &s;hillings in the pound upon the clergy, and three &s;hillings and four-pence from the laity; nor did he attempt to cover the violence of the mea&s;ure, by giving it the name either of benevolence or loan. This unwar|rantable &s;tretch of royal power was quickly op|po&s;ed by the people; they were unwilling to &s;ubmit to impo&s;itions unknown till now, and a general in&s;urrection threatened to en&s;ue. Henry had the prudence to &s;top &s;hort in that dangerous path into which he had entered; and declared, by circular letters to all the counties, that what was demanded was only by way of benevolence. But the &s;pirit of op|po&s;ition, once rou&s;ed, was not &s;o ea&s;ily quieted; the citizens of London he&s;itated on the de|mand; and in &s;ome parts of the country in&s;ur|rections
<PB N="344" REF="346">
were actually begun, which were &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed by the duke of Suffolk. The&s;e im|po&s;ts, which were fir&s;t advi&s;ed by Wol&s;ey, not happily &s;ucceeding, he began to lo&s;e a little of his favour with the king; and this di&s;plea&s;ure was &s;till more encrea&s;ed by the complaints of the clergy, who accu&s;ed him of extortion. Henry reproved Wol&s;ey, in &s;evere terms, which rendered him more cautious and art|ful for the future. As an in&s;tance of his cunning, having built a noble palace, called York Place, at We&s;tmin&s;ter, for his own u&s;e, fearing now the general cen&s;ure again&s;t him, he made a pre&s;ent of it to the king, a&s;&s;uring him, that from the fir&s;t he intended it as an offer to his maje&s;ty. Thus Wol&s;ey's impunity only &s;erved to pave the way to greater extortions. The pride of this prelate was great; but his riches were &s;till greater. In order to have a pretext for ama&s;&s;ing &s;uch &s;ums, he undertook to found two new colleges in Oxford, for which he received every day fre&s;h grants from the pope and the king. To execute this fa|vourite &s;cheme, he obtained a liberty of &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing &s;everal mona&s;teries, and converting their revenues to the benefit of his new foun|dation. Whatever might have been the pope's inducement to grant him the&s;e privileges, no|thing
<PB N="345" REF="347">
could be more fatal to the pontiff's in|tere&s;ts; for Henry was thus him&s;elf taught &s;hortly afterwards to imitate, what he had &s;een a &s;ubject perform with impunity.</P>
<P>Hitherto the admini&s;tration of all affairs was carried on by Wol&s;ey; for the king was contented to lo&s;e, in the embraces of his mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es, all the complaints of his &s;ubjects; and the cardinal undertook to keep him igno|rant, in order to continue his own uncontrolled authority. But now a period was approach|ing, that was to put an end to this mini&s;ter's exorbitant power. One of the mo&s;t extraor|dinary and important revolutions that ever employed the attention of man, was now ripe for execution. This was no le&s;s a change than the Reformation; to have an idea of the ri&s;e of which, it will be proper to take a cur&s;ory view of the &s;tate of the church at that time, and to ob&s;erve by what &s;eemingly contradic|tory means Providence produces the mo&s;t happy events.</P>
<P>The church of Rome had now, for more than a thou&s;and years, been corrupting the ancient &s;implicity of the Go&s;pel, and convert|ing into a temporality the kingdom of another world. The popes had been frequently &s;een at the head of their own armies, fighting for
<PB N="346" REF="348">
their dominions with the arm of fle&s;h, and forgetting in cruelty and dete&s;table maxims of &s;tate, all the pretended &s;anctity of their cha|racters. The cardinals, prelates, and digni|taries of the church, lived in envied &s;plen|dour, were &s;erved like voluptuous princes; and &s;ome of them were found to po&s;&s;e&s;s eight or nine bi&s;hopricks at once. Wherever the church governed, it exerted that power with cruelty; &s;o that to their luxuries were u&s;ual|ly added the crime of tyranny too. As for the inferior clergy, both popi&s;h and prote&s;|tant writers exclaim again&s;t their abandoned and di&s;&s;olute morals. They publicly kept mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, and bequeathed to their illegitimate children whatever they were able to &s;ave from their plea&s;ures, or extort from the poor. There is &s;till to be &s;een a will made by a bi&s;hop of Cambray, in which he &s;ets a&s;ide a certain &s;um for the ba&s;tards he has had already, and tho&s;e which, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, he may yet happen to have. In many parts of England and Germany, the people obliged their prie&s;ts to have concubines; &s;o that the laity might pre&s;erve their wives with greater &s;ecurity; while, at the &s;ame time, the poor laborious pea&s;ant and artizan &s;aw all the fruits of their toil go, not to cloathe and maintain their own little fa|milies,
<PB N="347" REF="349">
but to pamper men, who in&s;ulted them with lectures, to which their example appeared a flat contradiction. But the vices of the clergy were not greater than their ig|norance; few of them knew the meaning of their Latin ma&s;s. Their &s;agacity was chiefly employed in finding out witches, and exor|ci&s;ing the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; but what mo&s;t encrea&s;ed the hatred of the people again&s;t them was the &s;elling pardons and ab&s;olutions for &s;in, at certain &s;tated prices. A deacon, or &s;ubdea|con, who committed murder, was ab&s;olved from his crime, and allowed to po&s;&s;e&s;s three benefices upon paying twenty crowns. A bi|&s;hop or abbot might commit murder for about ten pounds of our money. Every crime had its &s;tated value; and ab&s;olutions were given for &s;ins not only already committed, but &s;uch as &s;hould be committed hereafter. The wi&s;e&s;t of the people looked with &s;ilent dete&s;tation on the&s;e impo&s;itions; and the ignorant them&s;elves, whom fortune &s;eemed to have formed for &s;lavery, began to open their eyes to &s;uch glar|ing ab&s;urdities.</P>
<P>The&s;e vices and impo&s;itions were now al|mo&s;t come to a head; and the encrea&s;e of arts and learning among the laity, propagated by means of printing, which had been lately in|vented,
<PB N="348" REF="350">
began to make them re&s;i&s;t that power, which was originally founded in deceit. Leo the tenth was at that time pope,<MILESTONE N="1519" UNIT="A.D."> and eagerly employed in building the church of St. Peter at Rome. In order to procure money for car|rying on that expen&s;ive undertaking, he gave a commi&s;&s;ion for &s;elling indulgences, a prac|tice that had been often tried before. The&s;e were to free the purcha&s;er from the pains of purgatory; and they would &s;erve even for one's friends, if purcha&s;ed with that intention. There were every where &s;hops opened, where they were to be &s;old; but in general they were to be had at taverns, brothels, and gam|ing hou&s;es. The Augu&s;tine friars had u&s;ually been employed in Saxony to preach the indul|gencies, and from this tru&s;t had derived both profit and con&s;ideration; but the pope's mi|ni&s;ter &s;uppo&s;ing that they had found out illicit methods of &s;ecreting the money, transferred this lucrative employment from them to the Dominicans. Martin Luther, profe&s;&s;or in the univer&s;ity of Wirtemberg, was an Augu&s;tine monk, and one of tho&s;e who re&s;ented this transfer of the &s;ale of indulgencies from one order to another. He began to &s;hew his in|dignation by preaching again&s;t their efficacy; and being naturally of a fiery temper, and
<PB N="349" REF="351">
provoked by oppo&s;ition, he inveighed again&s;t the authority of the pope him&s;elf. Being driven hard by his adver&s;aries &s;till as he en|larged his reading, in order to &s;upport his tenets, he di&s;covered &s;ome new abu&s;e or error in the church of Rome. The people, who had long groaned under the papal tyranny, heard his di&s;cour&s;es with plea&s;ure, and defend|ed him again&s;t the authority and machinations of his enemies. Frederic, elector of Saxony, &s;urnamed the Wi&s;e, openly protected him; the republic of Zurich even reformed their church according to the new model; and Lu|ther, a man naturally inflexible and vehement, was become incapable, either from promi&s;es of advancement, or terrors of &s;everity, to re|linqui&s;h a &s;ect, of which he was him&s;elf the founder. It was in vain, therefore, that the pope i&s;&s;ued out his bulls again&s;t Luther; it was in vain that the Dominican friars procured his books to be burned; he boldly abu&s;ed the Dominicans, and burned the pope's bull in the &s;treets of Wirtemberg. In the mean time, the di&s;pute was carried on by writing on either &s;ide. Luther, though oppo&s;ed by the pope, the conclave, and all the clergy, &s;upported his cau&s;e &s;ingly, and with &s;ucce&s;s. As the controver&s;y was new, his ignorance of many
<PB N="350" REF="352">
parts of the &s;ubject was not greater than theirs; and ill as he wrote, they an&s;wered &s;till wor&s;e. Opinions are inculcated upon the minds of mankind, rather by confidence and per&s;ever|ance, than by &s;trength of rea&s;oning, or beauty of diction; and no man had more confidence or more per&s;everance than he. In this di&s;pute, it was the fate of Henry to be a champion on both &s;ides. His father, who had given him the education of a &s;cholar, permitted him to be in&s;tructed in &s;chool-divinity, which then was the principal object of learned enquiry. Henry, therefore, willing to convince the world of his abilities in that &s;cience, obtain|ed the pope's permi&s;&s;ion to read the works of Luther, which had been forbidden, under pain of excommunication. In con&s;equence of this, the king defended the &s;even &s;acraments, out of St. Thomas Aquinas; and &s;hewed &s;ome dexterity in this &s;cience, though it is thought that Wol&s;ey had the chief hand in directing him. A book being thus fini&s;hed in ha&s;te, it was &s;ent to Rome for the pope's approbation, which it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e would not be with-held. The pontiff, ravi&s;hed with its elo|quence and depth, compared it to the labours of St. Jerome or St. Augu&s;tine; and reward|ed the author with the title of Defender of the
<PB N="351" REF="353">
Faith, little imagining that Henry was &s;oon to be one of the mo&s;t terrible enemies that ever the church of Rome had to contend with.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e cau&s;es, which contributed to render the Romi&s;h church odious and con|temptible, there were &s;till others, proceeding from political mea&s;ures. Clement the &s;eventh had &s;ucceeded Leo, and the hereditary animo&s;i|ty between the emperor and the pope breaking out into a war, Clement was impri&s;oned in the ca&s;tle of St. Angelo; and with thirteen cardi|nals, his adherents, kept in cu&s;tody for his ran|&s;om. As the demands of the emperor were exorbitant, Henry undertook to negotiate for the pope, and was procuring him a very fa|vourable treaty; but his holine&s;s, in the mean time, corrupting his guards, had the good for|tune to procure his e&s;cape from confinement; and leaving the treaty unfini&s;hed, &s;ent Henry a letter of thanks for his mediation. The violence of the emperor, taught Henry that popes might be injured with impunity; and the be|haviour of the pope manife&s;ted but little of that &s;anctity or infallibility to which the pon|tiffs pretended. Be&s;ides, as Henry had laid the pope thus under obligations, he &s;uppo&s;ed that he might, upon any emergency, expect a grate|ful return.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="354">It was in this &s;ituation of the church and the pope, that a new &s;cene was going to be opened, which was to produce endle&s;s di&s;turbances, and to change the whole &s;y&s;tem of Europe.<MILESTONE N="1527" UNIT="A.D."> Henry had now been eighteen years married to Ca|tharine of Arragon, who, as we have related, had been brought over from Spain to marry his elder brother, who died a few months after co-habitation. But notwith&s;tanding the &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive deference paid to the indulgence of the church, Henry's marriage with this prince&s;s did not pa&s;s without &s;cruple and he&s;itation. The prejudices of the people were in general bent again&s;t a conjugal union between &s;uch near relations; and the late king, though he had &s;olemnized the e&s;pou&s;als, when his &s;on was but twelve years of age, gave many intima|tions that he intended to annul them at a pro|per opportunity. The&s;e intentions might have given Henry &s;ome doubts and &s;cruples con|cerning the legitimacy of his marriage; but as he had three children by the prince&s;s, and as her character and conduct were blamele&s;s, he for a while kept his &s;ugge&s;tions private. But &s;he was &s;ix years older than him; and the decay of her beauty, together with particular infirmities and di&s;ea&s;es, had contributed to make him de&s;irous of another con&s;ort. How|ever,
<PB N="353" REF="355">
though he felt a &s;ecret di&s;like to her per|&s;on, yet for a long time he broke out into no flagrant act of contempt; contented to range from beauty to beauty among the ladies of his court, and his rank always procuring him a ready compliance. But Henry was carried forward, though perhaps not at fir&s;t excited, by a motive much more powerful than the tacit &s;ugge&s;tions of his con&s;cience. It happen|ed that among the maids of honour, then attending the queen, there was one Anna Bul|len, the daughter of Sir Thomas Bullen, a gentleman of di&s;tinction, and related to mo&s;t of the nobility. He had been employed by the king in &s;everal emba&s;&s;ies, and was mar|ried to a daughter of the duke of Norfolk. The beauty of Anne &s;urpa&s;&s;ed whatever had hitherto appeared at this voluptuous court; and her education, which had been at Paris, tended to &s;et off her per&s;onal charms. Her features were regular, mild, and attractive, her &s;tature elegant, though below the middle &s;ize, while her wit and vivacity exceeded even her other allurements. Henry, who had never learned the art of re&s;training any pa&s;&s;ion that he de&s;ired to gratify, &s;aw and loved her; but after &s;everal efforts to induce her to comply with his criminal de&s;ires, he found that with|out
<PB N="354" REF="356">
marriage, he could have no chance of &s;uc|ceeding. This ob&s;tacle, therefore, he hardily undertook to remove; and as his own queen was now become hateful to him, in order to procure a divorce, he alledged that his con|&s;cience rebuked him for having &s;o long lived in ince&s;t with the wife of his brother. In this pretended perplexity, therefore, he applied to Clement the &s;eventh, who owed him many obligations, de&s;iring to di&s;&s;olve the bull of the former pope, which had given him permi&s;&s;ion to marry Catharine; and to declare that it was not in the power, even of the holy &s;ee, to di&s;pen&s;e with a law &s;o &s;trictly enjoined in &s;crip|ture. The unfortunate pope was now in the utmo&s;t perplexity; queen Catharine was aunt to the emperor, who had lately made him a pri&s;oner, and who&s;e re&s;entment he dreaded to rekindle by thus injuring &s;o near a relation: be&s;ide, he could not in prudence declare the bull of the former pope illicit, for this would be giving a blow to the doctrine of papal in|fallibility. On the other hand, Henry was his protector and friend, the dominions of England were the chief re&s;ource from whence his finances were &s;upplied, and the king of France, &s;ome time before, had got a bull of divorce in &s;omewhat &s;imilar circum&s;tances. In
<PB N="355" REF="357">
this exigence, he thought the wi&s;e&s;t method would be to &s;pin out the affair by a negocia|tion; and, in the mean time, &s;ent over a com|mi&s;&s;ion to Wol&s;ey, in conjunction with the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, or any other Eng|li&s;h prelate, to examine the validity of the king's marriage, and the former di&s;pen&s;ation; grant|ing them al&s;o a provi&s;ional di&s;pen&s;ation for the king's marriage with any other per&s;on. When this me&s;&s;age was laid before the council in England, they prudently con&s;idered that an advice given by the pope in this &s;ecret manner, might very ea&s;ily be di&s;avowed in public; and that a clande&s;tine marriage would totally inva|lidate the legitimacy of any i&s;&s;ue the king &s;hould have by &s;uch a match. In con&s;e|quence of this, fre&s;h me&s;&s;engers were di&s;|patched to Rome, and eva&s;ive an&s;wers return|ed, the pope &s;till continuing to promi&s;e, re|cant, di&s;pute, and temporize; hoping that the king's pa&s;&s;ion would never hold out during the tedious cour&s;e of an eccle&s;ia&s;tical contro|ver&s;y. In this he was entirely mi&s;taken. Henry had been long taught to di&s;pute as well as he, and quickly found, or wre&s;ted, many texts of &s;cripture to favour his opinions or his pa&s;&s;ions. To his arguments he added threats, a&s;&s;uring the pope, that the Engli&s;h were already but too
<PB N="356" REF="358">
well di&s;po&s;ed to withdraw from the holy &s;ee; and that if he continued uncomplying, the whole country would readily follow the ex|ample of a monarch, who, &s;tung by ingrati|tude, &s;hould deny all obedience to a pontiff by whom he had always been treated with fal&s;ehood and duplicity. The king even pro|po&s;ed to his holine&s;s, whether in ca&s;e he were not permitted to put away his pre&s;ent queen, he might not have a di&s;pen&s;ation for having two wives at a time.</P>
<P>The pope, perceiving the eagerne&s;s of the king, at one time had thoughts of complying with his &s;ollicitations, and &s;ent cardinal Cam|pegio, his legate, to London, who, with Wol|&s;ey, opened a court for trying the legitimacy of the king's pre&s;ent marriage, and cited the king and the queen to appear before them. They both pre&s;ented them&s;elves; and the king an&s;wered to his name when called; but the queen, in&s;tead of an&s;wering to her's, ro&s;e from her &s;eat, and throwing her&s;elf at the king's feet, in the mo&s;t pathetic manner,<MILESTONE N="1592" UNIT="A.D."> entreated him to have pity upon her helple&s;s &s;ituation. A &s;tranger, unprotected, unfriended, &s;he could only rely on him as her guardian and defender, on him alone who knew her &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and her inno|cence, and not upon any court, in which her ene|mies
<PB N="357" REF="359">
prevailed, and would wre&s;t the laws again&s;t her; &s;he, therefore, refu&s;ed the pre&s;ent trial, where &s;he could expect neither ju&s;tice nor im|partiality. Yet notwith&s;tanding the queen's objections, her trial went forward; and Henry &s;hortly hoped to be gratified in his mo&s;t &s;an|guine expectations. The principal point which came before the legates, was the proof of prince Arthur's con&s;ummation of his marriage with Catharine, which &s;ome of his own expre&s;&s;ions to that purpo&s;e, tended to confirm. Other topics were preparing, tending to prove the in|ability of the pope him&s;elf to grant &s;uch a di&s;|pen&s;ation; and the bu&s;ine&s;s &s;eemed now to be drawing near a period, when, to the great &s;ur|prize of all, Campegio all of a &s;udden, with|out any warning, and upon very frivolous pre|tences, prorogued the court; and &s;hortly af|ter transferred the cau&s;e before the court of Rome.</P>
<P>During the cour&s;e of the&s;e perplexing ne|gociations, on the i&s;&s;ue of which Henry's hap|pine&s;s &s;eemed to depend, he had at fir&s;t ex|pected to find in his favourite Wol&s;ey, a warm defender, and a &s;teady adherent; but in this he found him&s;elf mi&s;taken. Wol&s;ey &s;eemed to be in pretty much the &s;ame dilemma with the pope. On the one hand, he was to plea&s;e his
<PB N="358" REF="360">
ma&s;ter the king, from whom he had received a thou&s;and marks of favour; and on the other hand, he feared to di&s;oblige the pope, who&s;e &s;ervant he more immediately was, and who be&s;ides had power to puni&s;h his di&s;obedience. He, therefore, re&s;olved to continue neuter in this controver&s;y; and though of all men the mo&s;t haughty, he gave way on this occa&s;ion to his colleague Campegio in all things, pre|tending a deference to his &s;kill in canon law. Wol&s;ey's &s;cheme of temporizing was highly di&s;plea&s;ing to the king, but for a while he en|deavoured to &s;tifle his re&s;entment, until it could act with more fatal certainty. He for &s;ome time looked out for a man of equal abilities and le&s;s art; and it was not long before acci|dent threw into his way one Thomas Cran|mer, of greater talents, and probably of more integrity. Cranmer was a doctor of divinity, and a profe&s;&s;or at Cambridge, but had lo&s;t his office upon marrying contrary to the in&s;titutes of the canon law, which enjoined celibacy to all the clergy. He had travelled in his youth into Germany; and it was there he became acquainted with Luther's works, and embraced his doctrines. This man happening to fall one evening into company with Gardiner &s;e|cretary of &s;tate, and Fox the king's almoner,
<PB N="359" REF="361">
the bu&s;ine&s;s of the divorce became the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation. He gave it as his opinion, that the readie&s;t way to quiet the king's con|&s;cience, or to extort the pope's con&s;ent, would be to con&s;ult all the univer&s;ities of Europe upon the affair; an advice which being brought to the king, plea&s;ed him &s;o much, that Cranmer was de&s;ired to follow the court.</P>
<P>The king finding him&s;elf provided with a per&s;on who could &s;upply Wol&s;ey's place, appeared le&s;s re&s;erved in his re&s;entments again&s;t that prelate. The attorney-general was ordered to prepare a bill of indictment again&s;t him; and he was &s;oon after commanded to re&s;ign the great &s;eal. Crimes are ea&s;ily found again&s;t a favourite in di&s;grace, and the courtiers did not fail to encrea&s;e the catalogue of his errors. He was ordered to depart from York-place palace; and all his furniture and plate were converted to the king's u&s;e. The inventory of his goods being taken, they were found to exceed even the mo&s;t extravagant &s;urmi&s;es. Of fine holland alone there were found a thou&s;and pieces; the walls of his pa|lace were covered with cloth of gold and &s;il|ver; he had a cup-board of plate of ma&s;&s;y gold; all the re&s;t of his riches and furniture were in proportion, and probably their great|ne&s;s
<PB N="360" REF="362">
invited the hand of power. The parlia|ment &s;oon after confirmed the &s;entence of the court of Star-chamber again&s;t him, and he was ordered to retire to E&s;her, a country &s;eat which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed near Hampton; there to await the king's further plea&s;ure, with all the fluctuations of hope and apprehen&s;ion. Still, however, he was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the archbi&s;ho|pric of York and bi&s;hopric of Winche&s;ter; and the king gave him di&s;tant gleams of hope, by &s;ending him a ring accompanied with a gracious me&s;&s;age. Wol&s;ey, who, like every bad character, was proud to his equals and mean to tho&s;e above him, happening to meet the king's me&s;&s;enger on hor&s;eback, immediate|ly alighted, and throwing him&s;elf on his knees in the mire, received, in that abject manner, tho&s;e marks of his maje&s;ty's conde&s;cen&s;ion. But his hopes were &s;oon overturned, for after he had mained &s;ome time at E&s;her, he was ordered to remove to his &s;ee of York; where he took up his re&s;idence at Cawood, and rendered him&s;elf very popular in the neighbourhood by his affa|bility. He was not allowed to remain long unmole&s;ted in this retreat. He was arre&s;ted by the earl of Northumberland, at the king's command, for high trea&s;on, and preparations were made for conducting him to London, in
<PB N="361" REF="363">
order to his trial. He at fir&s;t refu&s;ed to com|ply with the requi&s;ition, as being a cardinal; but finding the earl bent on performing his commi&s;&s;ion, he complied, and &s;et out, by ea&s;y journies, for London to appear as a criminal, where he had acted as a king. In his way he &s;tayed a fortnight at the earl of Shrew&s;bury's; where, one day at dinner, he was taken ill, not without violent &s;u&s;picions of having poi&s;oned him&s;elf. Being brought forward from thence, he with much difficulty reached Leice&s;ter Ab|bey; where the monks coming out to meet him, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Father abbot, I am come to lay my bones among you;"</Q> and immediately ordered his bed to be prepared. As his di&s;order encrea&s;ed, an officer being placed near, at once to guard and attend him, he &s;poke to him, a little before he expired, to this effect; <Q REND="inline">"I pray you have me heartily recommended unto his royal maje&s;ty; he is a prince of a mo&s;t royal carriage, and hath a princely heart, and rather than he will mi&s;s, or want any part of his will, he will endanger one half of his kingdom. I do a&s;&s;ure you, I have kneeled before him, for three hours together, to per&s;uade him from his will and appetite, but could not prevail. Had I but &s;erved God as diligently as I have &s;erved the
<PB N="362" REF="364">
king, he would not have given me over in my grey hairs. But this is the ju&s;t reward, that I mu&s;t receive for my indulgent pains and &s;tudy; not regarding my &s;ervice to God, but only to my prince."</Q> He died &s;oon after, in all the pangs of remor&s;e, and left a life which he had all along rendered turbid by am|bition, and wretched by mean a&s;&s;iduities. He left two natural children behind him, one of whom, being a prie&s;t, was loaded with church preferments.</P>
<P>Henry being now freed from the controul of a per&s;on, who had for &s;ome time been an ob|&s;tacle to his intentions, by Cranmer's advice, he had the legality of his pre&s;ent marriage con|va&s;&s;ed in all the mo&s;t noted univer&s;ities of Europe. It was very extraordinary to &s;ee the king on one &s;ide &s;oliciting the univer&s;ities to be favourable to his pa&s;&s;ion; and, on the other the emperor pre&s;&s;ing them with equal ardour to be favourable to his aunt. Henry liberally rewarded tho&s;e doctors who declared on his &s;ide; and the emperor granted benefices to &s;uch as voted in conformity to his wi&s;hes. Time has di&s;covered the&s;e intrigues. In one of Henry's account books, we find the di&s;|bur&s;ements he made on the&s;e occa&s;ions. To a
<PB N="363" REF="365">
&s;ub-deacon he gave a crown, to a deacon two crowns; and &s;o of the re&s;t, in proportion to the con&s;equence of the &s;tation or opinion. The per&s;on, however, who bribed on the&s;e occa|&s;ions, excu&s;ed him&s;elf, by declaring, that he never paid the money till after the vote was given. In this conte&s;t, the liberalities, and con&s;equently the votes of Henry prevailed; his intrigues for a favourable deci&s;ion being bet|ter carried on, as he was mo&s;t intere&s;ted in the debate. All the colleges of Italy and France unanimou&s;ly declared his pre&s;ent marriage a|gain&s;t all law divine and human; and there|fore alledged, that it was not in the power of the pope him&s;elf to grant a di&s;pen&s;ation. The only places where this deci&s;ion was mo&s;t warmly op|po&s;ed, were at Oxford and Cambridge; but they al&s;o concurred in the &s;ame opinion at la&s;t, having furni&s;hed out the formality of a debate. But the agents of Henry were not content with the &s;uf|frage of the univer&s;ities alone; the opinions of the Jewi&s;h Rabbis were al&s;o demanded; how|ever, their &s;uffrages were ea&s;ily bought up.</P>
<P>Henry being thus fortified by the &s;uffrages of the univer&s;ities, was now re&s;olved to op|po&s;e even the pope him&s;elf, and began in par|liament by reviving an old law again&s;t the
<PB N="364" REF="366">
clergy, by which it was decreed, that all tho&s;e who had &s;ubmitted to the legantine authority had incurred &s;evere penalties. The clergy, to conciliate the king's favour, were compelled to pay a fine of an hundred and eighteen thou&s;and pounds. A confe&s;&s;ion was likewi&s;e extorted from them, that the king was protector and &s;upreme head of the church and the clergy of England. By the&s;e conce&s;|&s;ions a great part of the profits, and &s;till more of the power, of the church of Rome, was cut off. An act &s;oon after was pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t levy|ing the fir&s;t fruits, or a year's rent, of all the bi&s;hopricks that fell vacant. The tie that held Henry to the church being thus broken, he re&s;olved to keep no further mea&s;ures with the pontiff. He therefore privately married Anne Bullen, whom he had created marchione&s;s of Pembroke, the duke of Norfolk, uncle to the new queen, her father, mother, and doctor Cranmer being pre&s;ent at the ceremony. Soon after finding the queen pregnant, he publicly owned his marriage, and, to colour over his di&s;obedience to the pope with an appearance of triumph, he pa&s;&s;ed with his beautiful bride through London, with a magnificence greater than had been ever known before. The &s;treets
<PB N="365" REF="367">
were &s;trewed, the walls of the hou&s;es were hung with tape&s;tries, the conduits ran with wine, and an univer&s;al joy was diffu&s;ed among the people, who were contented rather with the pre&s;ent fe&s;tivity, than &s;ollicitous to examine the motives of it. Catharine, who had all along &s;upported her claims with re&s;olution, and yet with mode&s;ty, was cited to a trial; but refu|&s;ing to appear, &s;he was pronounced contuma|cious, and judgment given again&s;t the validity of her marriage with the king. At length, therefore, finding the inutility of further re|&s;i&s;tance, &s;he retired to Ampthill, near Dun&s;ta|ble, where &s;he continued the re&s;t of her life in privacy and peace.</P>
<P>In the mean time, when this intelligence was conveyed to Rome, the conclave was in a rage; and the pope, incited by their ardour, and frighted al&s;o by the menaces of the em|peror, publi&s;hed a &s;entence, declaring queen Catharine alone to be Henry's lawful wife, and requiring him to take her again, with a denunciation of cen&s;ures in ca&s;e of refu&s;al. On the other hand, Henry finding that his &s;ub|jects of all ranks had taken part with him, and had willingly complied with his attempts to break a foreign dependence, re&s;olved no lon|ger
<PB N="366" REF="368">
to renew the&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions which no power could extort. The people had been prepared by degrees for this great innovation: care had been taken for &s;ome years to inculcate the doctrine, that the pope was entitled to no au|thority beyond the limits of his own dioce&s;e. The king, therefore, no longer delayed his me|ditated &s;cheme of &s;eparating entirely from the church of Rome. The parliament was at his devotion; the majority of the clergy was for him, as they had already declared again&s;t the pope, by decreeing in favour of the divorce; and the people, above all, wi&s;hed to &s;ee the church humbled, which had &s;o long controlled them at plea&s;ure, and grown opulent by their labours and di&s;tre&s;&s;es. Thus all things con|&s;piring to co-operate with his de&s;igns, he at once ordered him&s;elf to be declared by his clergy the &s;upreme head of the church; the parliament confirmed the title, aboli&s;hed all authority of the pope in England, voted all tributes,<MILESTONE N="1534" UNIT="A.D."> formerly paid to the holy &s;ee, as ille|gal, and entru&s;ted the king with the collation to all eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices. The nation came into the king's mea&s;ures with joy, and took an oath, called the oath of &s;upremacy; all the credit of the pope, that had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="367" REF="369">
for ages, was now at once overthrown, and none &s;eemed to repine at the revolution, ex|cept tho&s;e who were immediately intere&s;ted by their dependence on the court of Rome.</P>
<P>But though Henry had thus &s;eparated from the church, yet he had not addicted him&s;elf to the &s;y&s;tem of any other reformer. The idea of here&s;y &s;till appeared dete&s;table, as well as formidable, to him; and whil&s;t his re&s;entment again&s;t the &s;ee of Rome had removed one part of his early prejudices, he made it a point never to relinqui&s;h the re&s;t. Separate as he &s;tood from the catholic church, and from the Roman pontiff, the head of it, he &s;till valued him&s;elf on maintaining the catholic doctrines, and on guarding by fire and &s;word the imagined purity of its e&s;tabli&s;hments. His mini&s;ters and courtiers were of as motley a character as his conduct, and &s;eemed to waver, during the whole reign, between the ancient and the new religion. The young queen, en|gaged by intere&s;t, as well as inclination, favour|ed the cau&s;e of the reformers; Thomas Crom|well, who, from being a creature of Wol&s;ey, and who, by an admirable defence of the con|duct of his old ma&s;ter, had been taken into the favour and confidence of the king, em|braced
<PB N="368" REF="370">
the &s;ame views. Being a man of pru|dence and ability, he was very &s;ucce&s;sful in promoting the reformation, though in a con|cealed manner. Cranmer, who was now be|come archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, had all along adopted the prote&s;tant tenets, and had gained Henry's friend&s;hip by his candour and &s;in|cerity. On the other hand, the duke of Nor|folk adhered to the old mode of wor&s;hip; and by the greatne&s;s of his rank, as well as by his talents for peace and war, he had great weight in the king's council. Gardiner, lately cre|ated bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, had enli&s;ted him|&s;elf in the &s;ame party; and the &s;upplene&s;s of his character, and the dexterity of his con|duct, had rendered him extremely u&s;eful to it. The king, mean while, who held the balance between the&s;e contending factions, was en|abled, by the court&s;hip paid him by both pro|te&s;tants and catholics, to a&s;&s;ume an immea|&s;urable authority.</P>
<P>As the mode of religion was not as yet known, and as the minds of tho&s;e who were of oppo&s;ite &s;entiments were extremely exa&s;per|ated, it naturally followed that &s;everal mu&s;t fall a &s;acrifice in the conte&s;t between ancient e&s;tabli&s;hments, and modern reformation. The
<PB N="369" REF="371">
reformers were the fir&s;t who were exhibited as unhappy examples of the vindictive fury of tho&s;e who were for the continuance of ancient &s;uper&s;titions. One James Bainham, a gen|tleman of the Temple, being accu&s;ed of fa|vouring the doctrines of Luther, had been brought before Sir Thomas More during his chancellor&s;hip; and, after being put to the torture, was condemned as a relap&s;ed heretic, and was burned in Smithfield. One Thomas Bilney, a prie&s;t, had embraced the new doc|trine; but being terrified into an abjuration, he was &s;o &s;tung with remor&s;e, that he went into Norfolk, publicly recanting his former con|duct, and expo&s;ing the errors of popery. He was &s;oon &s;eized, tried in the bi&s;hop's court, condemned as a relap&s;ed heretic, and burnt accordingly. On the other hand, Henry was not remi&s;s in puni&s;hing &s;uch as di&s;owned the propriety of his late defection from Rome; and the monks, as they &s;uffered mo&s;t by the reformation, &s;o they were mo&s;t obnoxious, from their free manner of &s;peaking, to the royal re&s;entment.</P>
<P>To a&s;&s;i&s;t him in bringing the&s;e to puni&s;h|ment, the parliament had made it capital to deny his &s;upremacy over the church; and many priors and eccle&s;ia&s;tics lo&s;t their lives for this
<PB N="370" REF="372">
new &s;pecies of crime. But of tho&s;e who fell as a &s;acrifice to this &s;tern and unju&s;t law, none are &s;o much to be regretted as John Fi&s;her, bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, and the celebrated Sir Thomas More. Fi&s;her was a prelate eminent for his learning and morals; but &s;o firmly at|tached to ancient opinions, that he was thrown into pri&s;on, and deprived of his eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues; &s;o that he had &s;carce even rags to cover him in his &s;evere confinement. He was &s;oon after indicted for denying the king's &s;u|premacy, condemned, and beheaded.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas More is intitled to &s;till greater pity, as his merits were greater. This extra|ordinary man, who was one of the revivers of ancient literature, and inconte&s;tably the fore|mo&s;t writer of his age, had, for &s;ome time, refu&s;ed to act in &s;ub&s;erviency to the capricious pa&s;&s;ions of the king. He had been created chancellor; but gave up that high office, ra|ther than concur in the breach with the church of Rome. The au&s;terity of this man's virtue, and the &s;anctity of his manners, had in no wi&s;e encroached on the gentlene&s;s of his temper; but even in the mid&s;t of poverty and di&s;grace he could pre&s;erve that natural gaiety, which was probably in&s;pired by con&s;cious innocence. But on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, being put into
<PB N="371" REF="373">
confinement, no entreaties nor arguments could prevail with him to &s;peak an entire acknow|legement of the ju&s;tice of the king's claims. One Rich, who was then &s;ollicitor-general, was &s;ent to confer with him; and in his pre&s;ence he was inveigled to &s;ay, that any que&s;tion with regard to the law, which e&s;tabli&s;hed that pre|rogative, was like a two-edged &s;word. If a per&s;on an&s;wered one way it would confound his &s;oul; if another, it would de&s;troy his body. The&s;e words were &s;ufficient for the ba&s;e in|former to hang an accu&s;ation upon; and as trials at that time were but mere formalities, the jury gave &s;entence again&s;t More, who long expected his fate. His natural chearful|ne&s;s attended him to the la&s;t. When he was mounting the &s;caffold, he &s;aid to one, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Friend, help me up; and when I go down again, let me &s;hift for my&s;elf."</Q> The executioner a&s;king him forgivene&s;s, he granted the re|que&s;t, but told him, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You will never get credit by beheading me, my neck is &s;o &s;hort."</Q> Then laying his head on the block, he bid the executioner &s;tay till he had put a|&s;ide his beard, for &s;aid he, that has never com|mitted trea&s;on.</P>
<P>The concurrence which the people &s;eemed to lend to the&s;e fierce &s;everities, added to the
<PB N="372" REF="374">
great authority which Henry from his &s;evere and fierce deportment po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, induced him to proceed &s;till farther in his &s;cheme of inno|vation. As the monks had all along &s;hewn him the greate&s;t re&s;i&s;tance, he re&s;olved at once to deprive them of future power to injure him. He accordingly empowered Cromwell, &s;ecreta|ry of &s;tate, to &s;end commi&s;&s;ioners into the &s;e|veral counties of England to in&s;pect the mona|&s;teries; and to report, with rigorous exactne&s;s, the conduct and deportment of &s;uch as were re&s;ident there. This employment was readily undertaken by &s;ome creatures of the court, namely, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ayton, London, Price, Gage, Petre, and Bela&s;is, who are &s;aid to have di&s;covered mon&s;trous di&s;orders in many of the religious hou&s;es. Whole convents of women abandoned to all manner of lewdne&s;s, friars accomplices in their crimes, pious frauds every where prac|ti&s;ed to encrea&s;e the devotion and liberality of the people, and cruel and inveterate factions maintained between the members of many of the&s;e in&s;titutions. The&s;e accu&s;ations, whether true or fal&s;e, were urged with great clamour again&s;t the&s;e communities; and a general hor|ror was excited in the nation again&s;t them.</P>
<P>The king now, therefore, thought he might with &s;afety, and even &s;ome degree of popu|larity,
<PB N="373" REF="375">
aboli&s;h the&s;e in&s;titutions; but willing to proceed gently at fir&s;t, he gave directions to parliament to go no farther at pre&s;ent than to &s;uppre&s;s the le&s;&s;er mona&s;teries,<MILESTONE N="1536" UNIT="A.D."> who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed revenues below the value of two hundred pounds a year. By this act, three hundred and &s;eventy-&s;ix mona&s;teries were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; and their revenues, amounting to thirty-two thou&s;and pounds a year, were granted to the king, be&s;ides their goods and plate, computed at an hundred thou&s;and pounds more. But this was only the beginning of his confi&s;ca|tions; for about two years after, he re&s;olved upon the entire de&s;truction of all mona&s;teries what&s;oever. A new vi&s;itation was therefore appointed, and fre&s;h crimes were al&s;o pro|duced; &s;o that his &s;everities were conducted with &s;uch &s;eeming ju&s;tice and &s;ucce&s;s, that in le&s;s than two years, he became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the mona&s;tic revenues. The&s;e, on the whole, amounted to &s;ix hundred and forty-five, of which twenty-eight had abbots, who enjoyed a &s;eat in parliament. Ninety colleges were demoli&s;hed in &s;everal counties; two thou&s;and three hundred and &s;eventy-four chantries, and free chapels, and an hundred and ten ho&s;pi|tals. The whole revenue of the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;h|ments amounted to one hundred and &s;ixty-one
<PB N="374" REF="376">
thou&s;and pounds, which was about a twentieth part of the national income. The lo&s;s therefore which was &s;u&s;tained by the clergy upon this occa&s;ion, was by no means &s;o great or mortifying as the cruel in&s;ults and reproaches to which they were expo&s;ed for their former frauds and avarice. The num|berle&s;s reliques which they had ama&s;&s;ed, to de|lude and draw money from the people, were now brought forward, and expo&s;ed before the populace with the mo&s;t poignant contempt. An angel with one wing, that brought over the head of the &s;pear that pierced the &s;ide of Chri&s;t; coals that had roa&s;ted St. Lawrence, the parings of St. Edmond's toes, certain re|lics to prevent rain, others to &s;top the gene|ration of weeds among corn. There was a crucifix at Boxley in Kent, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appellation of the Rood of Grace, which had been long in reputation for bending, rai&s;|ing, rolling the eyes, and &s;haking the head. It was brought to London, and broke to pieces at Paul's Cro&s;s; and the wheels and &s;prings by which it was actuated &s;hewn to the people. At Hales in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, the monks had carried on a profitable traffick with the pre|tended blood of Chri&s;t in a cry&s;tal phial. This relic was no other than the blood of a
<PB N="375" REF="377">
duck killed weekly, and exhibited to the pil|grim; if his prayers were accepted, the blood was &s;hewn him; if &s;uppo&s;ed to be rejected, the phial was turned; and being on one &s;ide opake, the blood was no longer to be &s;een. But the &s;poils of St. Thomas &agrave; Becket's &s;hrine at Canterbury exceed what even imagination might conceive. The &s;hrine was broken down; and the gold that adorned it filled two large che&s;ts, that eight &s;trong men could hardly carry out of the church. The king even cited the &s;aint him&s;elf to appear, and to be tried and condemned as a traitor. He or|dered his name to be &s;truck out of the Calen|dar, his bones to be burned, and the office for his fe&s;tival to be &s;truck out of the Breviary. Such were the violent mea&s;ures with which the king proceeded again&s;t the&s;e &s;eats of indolence and impo&s;ture; but as great murmurs were ex|cited by &s;ome upon this occa&s;ion, he took care that all tho&s;e who could be u&s;eful to him, or even dangerous in ca&s;es of oppo&s;ition, &s;hould be &s;harers in the &s;poil. He either made a gift of the revenues of the convents to his principal cour|tiers, or &s;old them at low prices, or exchanged them for other lands on very di&s;advantageous terms. He al&s;o erected &s;ix new bi&s;hopricks, We&s;tmin&s;ter, Oxford, Peterborow, Bri&s;tol,
<PB N="376" REF="378">
Che&s;ter, and Glouce&s;ter, of which the la&s;t five &s;till continue. He al&s;o &s;ettled &s;alaries on the abbots and priors, proportioned to their for|mer revenues or their merits; and each monk was allowed a yearly pen&s;ion of eight marks for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>But though the king had entirely &s;eparated him&s;elf from Rome, yet he was unwilling to follow any guide in conducting a new &s;y&s;tem. He would not therefore wholly aboli&s;h tho&s;e practices, by which prie&s;tcraft had been car|ried to &s;uch a pitch of ab&s;urdity. The invo|cation of &s;aints was not yet aboli&s;hed by him, but only re&s;trained. He procured an act, or, more properly &s;peaking, gave orders, to have the Bible tran&s;lated into the vulgar tongue; but it was not permitted to be put into the hands of the laity. It was a capital crime to believe in the pope's &s;upremacy; and yet equally heinous to be of the reformed reli|gion, as e&s;tabli&s;hed in Germany. His opi|nions were at length delivered in a law, which, from its horrid con&s;equences, was afterwards termed the Bloody Statute, by which it was ordained, that whoever, by word or writing, denied tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, whoever maintained that the communion in both kinds was nece&s;|&s;ary, whoever a&s;&s;erted that it was lawful for
<PB N="377" REF="379">
prie&s;ts to marry, whoever alledged that vows of cha&s;tity might be broken, whoever main|tained that private ma&s;&s;es were unprofitable, or that auricular confe&s;&s;ion was unnece&s;&s;ary, &s;hould be found guilty of here&s;y, and burned or hanged as the court &s;hould determine. As the people were at that time chiefly compo&s;ed of tho&s;e who followed the opinions of Lu|ther, and &s;uch as &s;till adhered to the pope, this &s;tatute, with Henry's former decrees, in &s;ome mea&s;ure excluded both, and opened a field for per&s;ecution, which &s;oon after pro|duced its dreadful harve&s;ts.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;everities, however, were preceded by one of a different nature, ari&s;ing neither from religious nor political cau&s;es, but merely from tyrannical caprice. Anne Bullen, his queen, had been always a favourer of the re|formation, and con&s;equently had many ene|mies on that account, who only waited &s;ome fit occa&s;ion to de&s;troy her credit with the king; and that occa&s;ion pre&s;ented it&s;elf but too &s;oon. The king's pa&s;&s;ion was by this time quite palled by &s;atiety; as the only de|&s;ire he ever had for her aro&s;e from that bru|tal appetite, which enjoyment &s;oon de&s;troys, he was now, fallen in love, if we may &s;o pro&s;titute the expre&s;&s;ion, with another, and
<PB N="378" REF="380">
langui&s;hed for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Jane Seymour, who had for &s;ome time been maid of honour to the queen.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the queen's enemies perceived the king's di&s;gu&s;t, they &s;oon re&s;olved on tak|ing the fir&s;t opportunity of gratifying his in|clination to get rid of her, by producing crimes again&s;t her, which his pa&s;&s;ions would quickly make real.<MILESTONE N="1536" UNIT="A.D."> The counte&s;s of Roch|ford in particular, who was married to the queen's brother, her&s;elf a woman of infamous character, began with the mo&s;t cruel in&s;inua|tions again&s;t the reputation of her &s;i&s;ter-in-law. She pretended that her own hu&s;band was engaged in an ince&s;tuous corre&s;pondence with his &s;i&s;ter; and not contented with this in&s;inua|tion, repre&s;ented all the harmle&s;s levities of the queen, as favours of a criminal nature. The king's jealou&s;y fir&s;t appeared openly in a tilt|ing at Greenwich, where the queen happened to drop her handkerchief, as was &s;uppo&s;ed, to one of her minions to wipe his face, after having over-heated him&s;elf in the exerci&s;e. Though this might have been very harmle&s;s, the king abruptly retired from the place, and &s;ent orders to have her confined to her apart|ment. Anne &s;miled at fir&s;t, thinking the king was in je&s;t; but when &s;he found it was a very
<PB N="379" REF="381">
&s;erious affair, &s;he received the &s;acrament in her clo&s;et, &s;en&s;ible of what little mercy &s;he had to expect from &s;o furious a tyrant.</P>
<P>In the mean time, her enemies were not re|mi&s;s in enflaming the accu&s;ation again&s;t her. The duke of Norfolk, from his attachment to the old religion, took care to produce &s;everal witne&s;&s;es accu&s;ing her of incontinency with &s;ome of the meaner &s;ervants of the court. Four per&s;ons were particularly pointed out as her paramours; Henry Norris, groom of the &s;tole, We&s;ton, and Brereton, gentlemen of the king's bed-chamber, together with Mark Smeton, a mu&s;ician. As the&s;e had &s;erved her with much a&s;&s;iduity, their re&s;pect might have been con|&s;trued by &s;u&s;picion into more tender attach|ments. The next day the queen was &s;ent to the Tower, earne&s;tly prote&s;ting her innocence, and &s;ending up prayers to heaven for a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance in this extremity. She in vain begged to be admitted into the pre&s;ence of the king; the Lady Bullen, her uncle's wife, who had always hated her, was ordered to continue in the &s;ame chamber; and &s;he made a report of all the in|coherent ravings of the afflicted pri&s;oner. She owned that &s;he had once rallied Norris on his delaying his marriage, and had told him that he probably expected her, when &s;he &s;hould be
<PB N="380" REF="382">
a widow. She had reproved We&s;ton, &s;he &s;aid, for his affection to a kin&s;woman of hers, and his indifference towards his wife; but he told her that &s;he had mi&s;taken the object of his af|fection, for it was her&s;elf. She affirmed, that Smeton had never been in her chamber but twice, when he played on the harp&s;ichord; but &s;he acknowledged that he once had the bold|ne&s;s to tell her, that a look &s;ufficed him.</P>
<P>Every per&s;on at court now abandoned the unhappy queen in her di&s;tre&s;s, except Cran|mer, who, though forbid to come into the king's pre&s;ence, wrote a letter to him in behalf of the queen; but his interce&s;&s;ion had no effect. On the twelfth day of May, Norris, We&s;ton, Brereton, and Smeton, where tried in We&s;t|min&s;ter-Hall, when Smeton was prevailed upon, by the promi&s;e of a pardon, to confe&s;s a criminal corre&s;pondence with the queen; but he was never confronted by her he accu&s;ed; and his execution with the re&s;t, &s;hortly after, &s;erved to acquit her of the charge. Norris, who had been much in the king's favour, had an offer of his life, if he would confe&s;s his crime, and accu&s;e his mi&s;tre&s;s; but he rejected the propo&s;al with contempt, and died profe&s;&s;|ing her innocence, and his own.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="383">In the mean time, the queen, who &s;aw the terrible appearance of her fortunes, endea|voured to &s;often the king by every endeavour to &s;pare the lives of the unfortunate men, who&s;e deaths were decreed. But his was a &s;tern jealou&s;y fo&s;tered by pride; and nothing but her removal could appea&s;e him. Her letter to him upon this occa&s;ion, written from the Tower, is full of the tendere&s;t expo&s;tulations, and too remarkable to be omitted here; as its manner &s;erves at once to mark the &s;ituation of her mind, and &s;hews to what a pitch of refine|ment &s;he had carried the language even then. It is as follows.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>It was not to be expected that eloquence could prevail on a tyrant, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions were to be influenced by none of the nobler mo|tives; the queen and her brother were tried by a jury of peers; but upon what proof or pre|tence the crime of ince&s;t was urged again&s;t them is unknown; the chief evidence, it is &s;aid,
<PB N="385" REF="387">
amounted to no more, than that Rochford had been &s;een to lean on her bed before &s;ome com|pany. Part of the charge again&s;t her was, that &s;he had declared to her attendants, that the king never had her heart; which was con|&s;idered as a &s;lander upon the throne, and &s;train|ed into a breach of a late &s;tatute, by which it was declared criminal to throw any &s;lander up|on the king, queen, or their i&s;&s;ue. The un|happy queen, though una&s;&s;i&s;ted by coun&s;el, defended her&s;elf with great judgment, and pre|&s;ence of mind; and the &s;pectators could not forbear declaring her entirely innocent. She an&s;wered di&s;tinctly to all the charges brought again&s;t her: but the king's authority was not to be controuled; &s;he was declared guilty; and her &s;entence ran, that &s;he &s;hould be burn|ed or beheaded at the king's plea&s;ure. When this terrible &s;entence was pronounced again&s;t her, &s;he could not help offering up a prayer to Heaven, vindicating her innocence; and in a mo&s;t pathetic &s;peech to her judges, averred the inju&s;tice of her condemnation. But the tyrant, not &s;atisfied with this vengeance, was de&s;irous al&s;o of having her daughter declared illegitimate; and remembering the report of a contract between her and Percy, earl of Nor|thumberland, prevailed upon the queen, either
<PB N="386" REF="388">
by promi&s;e of life, or of executing the &s;entence in all its rigour, to confe&s;s &s;uch a contract. The afflicted primate, who &s;at as judge, thought him&s;elf obliged, by this confe&s;&s;ion, to pro|nounce the marriage null and invalid; and Henry, in the tran&s;ports of his malignant pro|&s;ecution did not &s;ee, that if her marriage had been invalid from the beginning, the &s;entence for adultery mu&s;t have been invalid al&s;o.</P>
<P>She, who had been once the envied object of royal favour, was now going to give a me|lancholy in&s;tance of the capriciou&s;ne&s;s of for|tune: upon her returning to pri&s;on, &s;he once more &s;ent prote&s;tations of her innocence to the king. <Q REND="inline">"You have rai&s;ed me, &s;aid &s;he, from privacy to make me a lady; from a lady you made me a counte&s;s; from a counte&s;s, a queen; and from a queen I &s;hall &s;hortly be|come a &s;aint in heaven."</Q> On the morning of her execution, &s;he &s;ent for King&s;tone, the keeper of the Tower, to whom, upon entering the pri&s;on, &s;he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. King&s;tone, I hear I am not to die till noon, and I am &s;orry for it; for I thought to be dead before this time, and free from a life of pain."</Q> The keeper attempt|ing to comfort her, by a&s;&s;uring her the pain would be very little, &s;he replied, <Q REND="inline">"I have heard the executioner is very expert; and
<PB N="387" REF="389">
(cla&s;ping her neck with her hands, laughing,) I have but a little neck."</Q> When brought to the &s;caffold, from a con&s;ideration of her child Elizabeth's welfare, &s;he would not enflame the minds of the &s;pectators again&s;t her pro&s;e|cutors, but contented her&s;elf with &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"that &s;he was come to die as &s;he was &s;entenced by the law."</Q> She would accu&s;e none, nor &s;ay any thing of the ground upon which &s;he was judg|ed; &s;he prayed heartily for the king, and call|ed him <Q REND="inline">"a mo&s;t merciful, and gentle prince; that he had always been to her a good and gra|cious &s;overeign; and that if any one &s;hould think proper to canva&s;s her cau&s;e, &s;he de&s;ired him to judge the be&s;t."</Q> She was beheaded by the executioner of Calais, who was brought over as much more expert than any in Eng|land. Her body was negligently thrown into a common che&s;t of elm tree, made to hold ar|rows, and was buried in the Tower. Anne Bullen &s;eemed to be guilty of no other crime, than that of having &s;urvived the king's affec|tions; and although many crowned heads were already put to death in England, &s;he was the fir&s;t that underwent all the forms of law, and was beheaded on a &s;caffold.</P>
<P>The people, in general, beheld her fate with pity; but &s;till more, when they di&s;covered the
<PB N="388" REF="390">
cau&s;e of the tyrant's impatience to de&s;troy her; for the very next day after her execution, he married the lady Jane Seymour, his cruel heart being no way &s;oftened by the wretched fate of one that had been &s;o lately the object of his warme&s;t affections. He al&s;o ordered his par|liament to give him a divorce between her &s;en|tence and execution; and thus he endeavoured to ba&s;tardize Elizabeth, the only child he had by her, as he had in the &s;ame manner formerly ba&s;tardized Mary, his only child by queen Ca|tharine.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to imagine, that &s;uch various inno|vations, and capricious cruelties, were not felt by the people without indignation; but their murmurs were fruitle&s;s, and their complaints di&s;regarded. Henry now made him&s;elf um|pire between tho&s;e of the ancient &s;uper&s;tition, and the modern reformation; both looked up to him for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and at mutual enmity with each other, he took the advantage of all. Be&s;ide, he had all the powerful men of the na|tions on his &s;ide, by the many grants he had made them of the lands and goods of which he had de&s;poiled the mona&s;teries. It was ea&s;y for him, therefore, to quell the various in&s;urrec|tions which his pre&s;ent arbitrary conduct pro|duced, as they were neither headed by any
<PB N="389" REF="391">
powerful man, nor conducted with any kind of fore&s;ight, but merely the tumultuary efforts of angui&s;h and de&s;pair. The fir&s;t ri&s;ing was in Lincoln&s;hire, headed by doctor Mackrel, prior of Barlings; and though this tumultuary army, amounted to twenty thou&s;and men, upon a proclamation being made, with a&s;&s;urances of pardon, the populace di&s;per&s;ed; and Mackrel, with &s;ome more of the leaders, falling into the king's hands, were put to death. Another ri&s;ing followed &s;oon after, in the North, a|mounting to above forty thou&s;and men, who were preceded by prie&s;ts, carrying the en&s;igns of their function before the army; and all &s;eem|ing chiefly in&s;pired with an enmity again&s;t Cromwell, whom they con&s;idered as the in|&s;tigator of the king's &s;everities. But the&s;e al&s;o were &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed upon finding their pro|vi&s;ions grown &s;hort; after having in vain en|deavoured to attack the duke of Norfolk's army, which was &s;ent again&s;t them, and from which they were &s;eparated by a rivulet that was &s;woln by heavy rains. A new in&s;urrec|tion broke out out &s;hortly after, headed by Mu&s;grave and Tilby; but the in&s;urgents were di&s;per&s;ed and put to flight by the duke of Norfolk. Be&s;ides, one A&s;ke, a gentleman of that part of the country, who led the fir&s;t in|&s;urrection,
<PB N="390" REF="392">
lord Darcy, Sir Robert Con&s;table, Sir John Bulmer, Sir Thomas Percy, Sir Ste|phen Hamilton, Nicholas Tempe&s;t, and Wil|liam Lumley, were thrown into pri&s;on, con|demned, and executed. Henry, enraged by multiplied revolts, was re&s;olved to put no bounds to his &s;everities; and the birth of a prince, afterwards Edward the &s;ixth, and the death of the queen, who &s;urvived this joyful occa&s;ion but two days, made but a &s;mall pau&s;e in the fierce &s;everity with which tho&s;e were treated who were found to oppo&s;e his will.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="Oct. 12. 1537."> In the mid&s;t of the&s;e commotions, the fires of Smithfield were &s;een to blaze with unu&s;ual fiercene&s;s. Tho&s;e who adhered to the pope, or tho&s;e who followed the doctrines of Luther, were equally the objects of royal vengeance, and eccle&s;ia&s;tical per&s;ecution. From the mul|tiplied alterations which were made in the na|tional &s;y&s;tems of belief, mo&s;tly drawn up by Henry him&s;elf, few knew what to think, or what to profe&s;s. They were ready enough, indeed, to follow his doctrines, how incon&s;i&s;t|ent or contradictory &s;oever; but as he was continually changing them him&s;elf, they could hardly pur&s;ue &s;o fa&s;t as he advanced before them. Thomas Cromwell, rai&s;ed by the king's caprice, from being a black&s;mith's &s;on, to be
<PB N="391" REF="393">
a royal favourite, for tyrants ever rai&s;e their favourites from the lowe&s;t of the people, to|gether with Cranmer, now become archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, were both &s;een to favour the re|formation with all their endeavours. On the other hand, Gardiner bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, together with the duke of Norfolk, were for leading the king back to his original &s;uper&s;ti|tion. In fact, Henry &s;ubmitted to neither; his pride had long been &s;o enflamed by flat|tery, that he thought him&s;elf entitled to regu|late, by his own &s;ingle opinion, the religious faith of the whole nation.</P>
<P>In this univer&s;al terror and degeneracy of mankind, during which the &s;everities of one man alone was &s;ufficient to keep millions in awe, there &s;eemed to be a poor &s;chool-ma&s;ter in London, who boldly &s;tood up for the rights of humanity, and ventured to think for him|&s;elf. This man's name was John Lambert, who hearing doctor Taylor preach upon the real pre&s;ence in the &s;acrament, pre&s;ented him with his rea&s;ons for contradicting that doctrine. The paper was carried to Cranmer and Latimer, who were then of the opinion of Luther on that head, and endeavoured to bring him over to their opinions. But Lambert remain|ed &s;teady in his belief; and they were morti|fied
<PB N="392" REF="394">
when, in&s;tead of recanting, he appealed to the king him&s;elf. This was a challenge that plea&s;ed Henry's vanity, and willing at once to exert his &s;upremacy, and di&s;play his learning, he accepted the appeal; and public notice was given of his intended di&s;putation. For this purpo&s;e, &s;caffolds were erected in We&s;tmin|&s;ter-Hall for the accommodation of the audience; and Henry appeared on his throne, accompa|nied with all the en&s;igns of maje&s;ty. The pre|lates were placed on his right hand, the tem|poral peers on his left. The judges, and mo&s;t eminent lawyers, had a place a&s;&s;igned them behind the bi&s;hops; the courtiers of the greate&s;t di&s;tinction, behind the peers. Poor Lambert was produced in the mid&s;t of this &s;plendid a&s;&s;embly, with not one creature to de|fend or &s;upport him. The bi&s;hop of Che&s;ter opened the conference by declaring, that the king, notwith&s;tanding any &s;light alterations he had made in the rites of the church, was yet determined to maintain the purity of the catholic faith; and to puni&s;h, with the utmo&s;t &s;everity, all departure from it. After this preamble, &s;ufficient to terrify the bolde&s;t di&s;|putant, the king a&s;ked Lambert, with a &s;tern countenance, what his opinion was of tran&s;ub|&s;tantiation. When Lambert began his ora|tion
<PB N="393" REF="395">
with a compliment to his maje&s;ty, Henry rejected his prai&s;e with di&s;dain and indigna|tion. He afterwards entered upon the di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion of that ab&s;tru&s;e que&s;tion; and endea|voured to pre&s;s Lambert with &s;ome arguments, drawn from the &s;criptures and the &s;choolmen. At every word the audience were ready to &s;e|cond him with their applau&s;e and admiration. Lambert, however, no way di&s;couraged, was not &s;low to reply; but here Cranmer &s;tept in and &s;econded the king's proofs by &s;ome new topics. Gardiner entered the li&s;ts in &s;upport of Cranmer; Ton&s;tal took up the argument after Gardiner; Stoke&s;ley brought fre&s;h aid to Ton&s;tal. Six bi&s;hops more appeared &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively in the field again&s;t the poor &s;olitary di&s;putator, who, for five hours, long attempt|ed to vindicate his doctrines, till at la&s;t fatigu|ed, confounded, brow-beaten, and aba&s;hed, he was reduced to &s;ilence. The king then re|turning to the charge, demanded if he was convinced; and whether he cho&s;e to gain life by recantation, or to die for his ob&s;tinacy? Lambert, no way intimidated, replied, that he ca&s;t him&s;elf wholly on his maje&s;ty's clemency; to which Henry replied, <Q REND="inline">"that he would ne|ver protect an heretic; and, therefore, if that was his final an&s;wer, he mu&s;t expect to be
<PB N="394" REF="396">
committed to the flames."</Q> Lambert, no way terrified, heard Cromwell read the &s;entence, by which he was condemned to be burnt alive, with the utmo&s;t compo&s;ure; and as if his per|&s;ecutors were re&s;olved to try his fortitude, the executioners were ordered to make his puni&s;hment as painful as they could. He was, therefore, burned at a &s;low fire, his legs and thighs being fir&s;t con&s;umed; and when there appeared no end of his tortures, &s;ome of the guards, more merciful than the re&s;t, lifted him on their halberts; and while he yet continued to cry out, <Q REND="inline">"None but Chri&s;t! None but Chri&s;t!"</Q> he was wholly con&s;umed by the &s;ur|rounding fire.</P>
<P>This poor man's death &s;eemed to be only a &s;ignal for that of many more. Adulation had whi&s;pered the king with &s;uch an opinion of his own ability, that he now re&s;olved to puni&s;h rigorou&s;ly all tho&s;e who &s;hould pre&s;ume to differ from him in point of opinion, without making any di&s;tinction between Catholic or Lutheran. Soon after, no le&s;s than five hun|dred per&s;ons were impri&s;oned for contradict|ing the opinions delivered in the bloody &s;ta|tute; and received protection only from the lenity of Cromwell. For &s;ome time, al&s;o, doc|tor Barnes, who had been in&s;trumental in
<PB N="395" REF="397">
Lambert's execution, felt, in his turn, the &s;e|verity of the per&s;ecuting &s;pirit; and by a bill in parliament, without any trial, was condemn|ed to the flames, di&s;cu&s;&s;ing theological que&s;|tions at the very &s;take. With Barnes were executed one Gerrard, and Jerome, for the &s;ame opinions. Three Catholics, al&s;o, who&s;e names were Abel, Fether&s;tone, and Powel, were dragged upon the &s;ame hurdles to execution; and declared, that the mo&s;t grievous part of their puni&s;hment, was the being coupled with &s;uch heretical mi&s;creants as were united in the &s;ame calamity.</P>
<P>During the&s;e horrid tran&s;actions, Henry was re&s;olved to take another queen, and, after &s;ome negotiation upon the continent, he contracted a marriage with Anne of Cleves, his aim being by her means to fortify his alliances with the princes of Germany. Nor was he led into this match without a mo&s;t &s;crupulous exami|nation on his &s;ide, of the lady's per&s;onal ac|compli&s;hments. He was a&s;&s;ured by his envoy that &s;he was of a very large per&s;on, which was the more plea&s;ing to him, as he was at that time him&s;elf become very corpulent, and con|&s;equently required a &s;imilar figure in a wife. He was &s;till further allured by her picture, in which Holbein, who drew it, was, it &s;eems,
<PB N="396" REF="398">
more a friend to his art than to truth; for he greatly flattered her. The king, therefore, upon her landing went privately to meet her at Roche&s;ter, where he was very much damp|ed in his amorous ardour. He found her big indeed, and tall as he could wi&s;h; but utterly devoid of grace and beauty; &s;he could al&s;o &s;peak but one language, her native Ger|man; &s;o that her conver&s;ation could never recompence the defects of her per&s;on. He &s;wore &s;he was a great Flanders mare; and add|ed that he could never &s;ettle his affections upon her. However, &s;en&s;ible that he would greatly di&s;oblige her brother the duke, and con&s;equently all the German princes in his al|liance, he re&s;olved to marry her; and he told Cromwell, who was chiefly in&s;trumental in this affair, that &s;ince he had gone &s;o far, he would put his neck into the yoke, whatever it co&s;t him. The marriage was accordingly celebrated; but the king's di&s;gu&s;t was only encrea&s;ed by it; he told Cromwell the next morning, that he hated her more than ever; and even &s;u&s;pected her not to be a true maid, a circum&s;tance in which he thought him&s;elf extremely &s;kilful. Cromwell &s;aw the danger he incurred by having been in&s;trumental in forming this union; but he endeavoured by
<PB N="397" REF="399">
his a&s;&s;iduity, and humble adulation, to keep the king from coming to extremities with him.</P>
<P>But he &s;hould have known that a tyrant once offended is implacable. Henry's aver|&s;ion to the queen &s;ecretly encrea&s;ed every day; and he at length re&s;olved to get rid of her, and his prime mini&s;ter together. The fall of this favourite was long and ardently wi&s;hed for by a great part of the nation. The nobility hated a man, who from &s;uch mean beginnings, was placed before the fir&s;t per&s;ons in the kingdom; for be&s;ides being made vicar-general, which gave him almo&s;t ab&s;olute authority over the clergy, he was lord privy-&s;eal, lord chamberlain, and ma&s;ter of the wards. He had al&s;o obtained the order of the garter, a dignity which had hitherto been only conferred on the mo&s;t illu&s;trious families; and to carry his exaltation &s;till higher, he had been made earl of E&s;&s;ex. The prote&s;tants di&s;liked him for his concurrence with the king's will in their per&s;ecution; and the papi&s;ts dete&s;ted him, as the inveterate enemy of their religion. It only remained, therefore, with the king to ha&s;ten or retard the puni&s;hment of a man, who had &s;carce a partizan in the nation, except him&s;elf. But he had a &s;trong cau&s;e of di&s;like to him for his late unpropitious alliance; and
<PB N="398" REF="400">
a new motive was &s;oon added for encrea&s;ing his di&s;plea&s;ure. He had fixed his affection on Catharine Howard, niece to the duke of Nor|folk; and the only method of gratifying this new pa&s;&s;ion was, as in former ca&s;es, di&s;card|ing the pre&s;ent queen to make a room for a new one. The duke of Norfolk had long been Cromwell's mortal enemy, and eagerly embraced this opportunity to de&s;troy a man he con&s;idered as his rival. He therefore made u&s;e of all his niece's arts to ruin the favourite; and when his project was ripe for execution, he obtained a commi&s;&s;ion from the king to arre&s;t Cromwell for high trea&s;on. His di&s;|grace was no &s;ooner known, then all his friends for&s;ook him, except Cranmer, who wrote &s;uch a letter to Henry in his behalf, as no other man in the kingdom would have pre&s;umed to offer. However, he was accu&s;ed in parlia|ment of here&s;y and trea&s;on; and without being ever heard in his own defence, condemned to &s;uffer the pains of death, as the king &s;hould think proper to direct. Cromwell's fortitude &s;eemed to for&s;ake him in this dreadful exigen|cy. He wrote to the king for pardon; &s;aid, that the frail fle&s;h incited him continually to apply to his grace for mercy, and &s;ub&s;cribed his epi&s;tle with a heavy heart, and a trembling
<PB N="399" REF="401">
hand, <Q REND="inline">"from the king's mo&s;t mi&s;erable pri&s;oner and poor &s;lave at the Tower, Thomas Crom|well. Mercy, mercy, mercy."</Q></P>
<P>Cromwell's letter touched the hard heart of the monarch; he ordered it to be read to him three times; and then, as if willing to gain a victory over all his &s;ofter feelings, he &s;igned the warrant for beheading him upon Tower-Hill. When he was brought to the &s;caffold, his regard for his &s;on hindered him from ex|patiating upon his own innocence; he thanked God for bringing him to that death for his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, confe&s;&s;ed he had often been &s;e|duced, but that he now died in the catholic faith. It was thus that Henry, not &s;atis|fied with the death of tho&s;e whom he cho&s;e to puni&s;h, repre&s;&s;ed their complaints al&s;o; and terrified the unhappy &s;ufferers from the la&s;t con&s;olation of the wretched, the &s;atisfaction of upbraiding their per&s;ecutors. In this man|ner, the unhappy &s;ufferer having &s;pent &s;ome time in his private devotions, &s;ubmitted his neck to the executioner, who mangled him in a mo&s;t terrible manner. A few days after his death, a number of people were execut|ed together upon very different accu&s;ations. Some for having denied the king's &s;upremacy, and others for having maintained the doctrines of Luther.</P>
<P><PB N="400" REF="402">About a month after the death of Cromwell, the king declared his marriage with Catharine Howard, whom he had &s;ome time before pri|vately e&s;pou&s;ed. This was regarded as a very favourable incident by the catholic party; and the &s;ub&s;equent events for a while turned out to their wi&s;h. The king's councils being now entirely directed by Norfolk and Gardiner, a furious per&s;ecution commenced again&s;t the prote&s;tants; and the law of the &s;ix articles was executed with rigour; &s;o that a foreigner, who was then re&s;iding in England, had rea&s;on to &s;ay, that tho&s;e who were again&s;t the pope were burned, and tho&s;e who were for him were hanged. The king, with an o&s;tentatious im|partiality, reduced both parties to an equal &s;hare of &s;ubordination, and infu&s;ed terror into every brea&s;t.</P>
<P>But the mea&s;ure of his &s;everities was not yet filled up. He had thought him&s;elf very happy in his new marriage. He was &s;o cap|tivated with the queen's accompli&s;hments, that he gave public thanks for his felicity, and de|&s;ired his confe&s;&s;or to join with him in the &s;ame thank&s;giving. This joy, however, was of very &s;hort duration. While the king was at York, upon an intended conference with the king of Scotland, a man of the name of La&s;|&s;els
<PB N="401" REF="403">
had waited upon Cranmer at London; and from the information of this man's &s;i&s;ter, who had been &s;ervant to the dutche&s;s-dowager of Norfolk, he gave a very &s;urprizing account of the queen's incontinence. He averred that &s;he led a very lewd life before her mar|riage, and had carried on a &s;candalous corre|&s;pondence with two men, called Derham and Mannock; and that &s;he continued to indulge her&s;elf in the &s;ame criminal plea&s;ures &s;ince &s;he had been rai&s;ed to her pre&s;ent greatne&s;s. Cran|mer was equally &s;urprized and embarra&s;&s;ed at this intelligence, which he communicated to the chancellor, and &s;ome other members of the privy-council, who advi&s;ed him to make the king acquainted with the whole affair on his return to London. The archbi&s;hop knew the hazards he ran by intermedling in &s;uch delicate points; but he al&s;o knew the dangers he incurred by &s;uppre&s;&s;ing his information. He therefore re&s;olved to communicate what he had heard to writing, in the form of a me|morial; and this he &s;hortly after delivered into the king's own hand, de&s;iring his maje&s;ty to read it in private. Henry at fir&s;t di&s;believed, or pretended to di&s;believe, the report; he or|dered the keeper of the privy-&s;eal to examine La&s;celles, who per&s;i&s;ted in his former narra|tive;
<PB N="402" REF="404">
and even produced his &s;i&s;ter to confirm his account. Upon this, Derham and Man|nock were arre&s;ted, and they quickly confe&s;&s;ed their own guilt, and the queen's incontinency. They went &s;till farther, by impeaching the old lady Rochford, who had formerly been &s;o in&s;trumental in procuring the death of Anne Bullen. They alledged that this lady had in|troduced one Culpepper into the queen's bed-chamber, who &s;tayed with her from eleven at night till four in the morning. When the queen was fir&s;t examined relative to her crime, &s;he denied the charge; but afterwards finding that her accomplices were her accu&s;ers, &s;he confe&s;&s;ed her incontinence before marriage, but denied her having di&s;honoured the king's bed &s;ince their union. But three maids of ho|nour, who were admitted to her &s;ecrets, &s;till fur|ther alledged her guilt; and &s;ome of them con|fe&s;&s;ed having pa&s;t the night in the &s;ame bed with her and her lovers. The king was &s;o affected at this di&s;covery that he bur&s;t into a flood of tears, and bitterly lamented his misfortune. Derham, Mannock, and Culpepper, were con|victed and executed; but he was re&s;olved to throw the odium of the queen's death upon the parliament, who had always &s;hewn them|&s;elves the ready mini&s;ters of all his &s;everities.
<PB N="403" REF="405">
The&s;e &s;ervile creatures, upon being informed of the queen's crime and confe&s;&s;ion, found her quickly guilty, and petitioned the king that &s;he might be puni&s;hed with death; that the &s;ame penalty might be inflicted on the lady Rochford, the accomplice of her debauch|eries; and that her grand-mother, the dutche&s;s dowager of Norfolk, together with her father, mother, and nine others, men and women, as having been privy to the queen's irregulari|ties, &s;hould participate in her puni&s;hment. With this petition the king was mo&s;t gra|ciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to agree; they were condemn|ed to death by an act of attainder, which, at the &s;ame time, made it capital for all per|&s;ons to conceal their knowlege of the de|baucheries of any future queen. It was al&s;o enacted, that if the king married any wo|man who had been incontinent, taking her for a true maid, &s;he &s;hould be guilty of trea|&s;on, in ca&s;e &s;he did not previou&s;ly reveal her guilt. The people made merry with this ab&s;urd and brutal &s;tatute; and it was &s;aid, that the king mu&s;t henceforth look out for a widow. After all the&s;e laws were pa&s;&s;ed, in which the mo&s;t wonderful circum&s;tance is, that a body of men could ever be induced to give their con&s;ent, the queen was be|headed
<PB N="404" REF="406">
on Tower Hill, together with the lady Rochford, who found no great degree of com|pa&s;&s;ion, as &s;he had her&s;elf before tampered in blood. The queen was more pitied, as &s;he owned that &s;he had led a di&s;&s;olute life before marriage; but denied in her la&s;t moments, and with the utmo&s;t &s;olemnity, that &s;he had ever been untrue &s;ince her marriage with the king. The public exclaimed &s;o loudly again&s;t the &s;everity of the act, which brought in &s;o many accomplices of her guilt, that the king did not think proper to execute &s;entence upon them, though &s;ome of them were long de|tained in confinement.</P>
<P>Henry having thus, by various acts of ty|ranny, &s;hewn that he was abandoned to all ideas of ju&s;tice, morals, or humanity, at la&s;t took it into his head to compo&s;e a book of religion, which was to be the code by which his &s;ubjects &s;hould for the future regulate all their belief and actions. Having procured an act of parliament for this purpo&s;e, in which all &s;piritual &s;upremacy was declared to be ve&s;ted in him,<MILESTONE N="1541" UNIT="A.D."> he publi&s;hed a &s;mall volume &s;oon after, called the In&s;titution of a Chri&s;tian Man, which was received by the convocation, and voted to be the infallible &s;tandard of or|thodoxy. All the ab&s;tru&s;e points of ju&s;tifica|tion,
<PB N="405" REF="407">
faith, free-will, good works, and grace, are there defined with a leaning towards the opinion of the reformers; while the &s;acraments, which a few years before were only allowed to be three, are there encrea&s;ed to their original number of &s;even, conformable to the &s;entiments of the catholics. But the king was not long &s;atis|fied with this code of belief; for he &s;oon after procured a new book to be compo&s;ed, call|ed The Erudition of a Chri&s;tian Man, which he publi&s;hed upon his own authority; and though this new creed differed a good deal from the former, yet he was no le&s;s po&s;itive in requiring a&s;&s;ent to this, than he had been to the former. In both the&s;e books he was very ex|plicit in enforcing the doctrine of pa&s;&s;ive obe|dience; &s;o that his in&s;titutions were not likely to weaken what he &s;o powerfully enforced by his &s;everities.</P>
<P>But his authority in religion was not more uncontrolled than in temporal concerns. An alderman, one Read, who had refu&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with a benevolence, was pre&s;&s;ed as a pri|vate centinel, and &s;ent to &s;erve in an army which was levied again&s;t an incur&s;ion of the Scotch. In this manner, all who oppo&s;ed his will were either pre&s;&s;ed or impri&s;oned, happy if they e&s;caped with &s;uch &s;light puni&s;hments. His
<PB N="406" REF="408">
parliament made a law, by which the king's proclamations were to have the &s;ame force as &s;tatutes; and to facilitate the execution of this act, by which all &s;hadow of liberty was totally removed, they appointed that any nine of the privy council &s;hould form a legal court for puni&s;hing all di&s;obedience to all proclama|tions. Thus the king was empowered to i&s;&s;ue a proclamation to de&s;troy the lives, or take away the properties, of any of his &s;ubjects; and the only redre&s;s was to him&s;elf in council.</P>
<P>In about a year after the death of the la&s;t queen,<MILESTONE N="1543" UNIT="A.D."> Henry once more changed his condi|tion, by marrying his &s;ixth and la&s;t wife, Ca|tharine Parr, who, according to the ridiculous &s;ugge&s;tions of the people, was, in fact, a widow. She was the wife of the late lord Latimer; and was con&s;idered as a woman of di&s;cretion and virtue. She was already pa&s;&s;ed the meridian of life, and managed this capri|cious tyrant's temper with prudence and &s;uc|ce&s;s. His amiable days had long been over; he was almo&s;t choaked with fat, and had contracted a moro&s;e air, very far from in&s;pir|ing affection. Neverthele&s;s, this woman, &s;a|crificing her appetites to her ambition, &s;o far prevailed in gaining his confidence, that &s;he was appointed regent of the kingdom during
<PB N="407" REF="409">
his ab&s;ence in France, whither he pa&s;&s;ed over at the head of thirty thou&s;and men, to pro|&s;ecute a war which had been declared be|tween him and the French king. He there behaved, as in all his former undertakings, with ineffectual o&s;tentation. In&s;tead of march|ing into the heart of the country, he &s;at down before Boulogne, which was obliged to capi|tulate; and his ally, the emperor, making a &s;eparate peace, Henry was obliged to return with his army into England, where he found his &s;ubjects ready to offer him their accu&s;tom|ed adulation, and to prai&s;e him for an enter|prize in which, at an infinite charge, he had made an acqui&s;ition that was of no manner of benefit.</P>
<P>But of all his &s;ubjects none &s;eemed more abandoned and ba&s;ely &s;ervile than the par|liament, which it might have been rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed would rather be the protectors of the people, than the &s;laves of the crown. Upon his return from his expen&s;ive French expedi|tion, after profe&s;&s;ions of the greate&s;t &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion and profound acknowledgement, they granted him a &s;ub&s;idy equal to his demands, and added to it a gift, which will make their me|mory odious to the mo&s;t di&s;tant po&s;terity. By one vote they be&s;towed upon him all the revenues
<PB N="408" REF="410">
of the two univer&s;ities, as well as of &s;ome other places of education and public wor&s;hip. But rapacious as this monarch was, he refrain|ed from de&s;poiling the&s;e venerable &s;eminaries of their ancient endowments; however they ow|ed their &s;afety to his lenity, and not to the pro|tection of this ba&s;e and degenerate parliament.</P>
<P>Nor was he le&s;s ju&s;t upon another occa&s;ion with regard to the &s;ugge&s;tions of his council, who had long conceived an hatred again&s;t Cranmer, and laboured to de&s;troy him. This ju&s;t and moderate man had all along owed his &s;afety to his integrity; and &s;corning intrigue him&s;elf, was therefore the le&s;s liable to be cir|cumvented by the intrigues of others. The catholic party had long repre&s;ented to the king that Cranmer was the &s;ecret cau&s;e of mo&s;t of the divi&s;ions which tore the nation, as his example and &s;upport were the chief props of here&s;y. Henry &s;eeing the point to which they tended, and de&s;irous of knowing how far they would carry their intrigues, feigned a compliance with their wi&s;hes, and ordered the council to make enquiry in|to the primate's conduct and crimes. All the world therefore concluded that his di&s;|grace was certain, and his death inevitable. His old friends who, from mercenary motives,
<PB N="409" REF="411">
had been attached to him, now began to treat him with mortifying neglect; he was obliged to &s;tand &s;everal hours among the &s;ervants at the door of the council-chamber before they deigned to admit him; and he made his ap|pearance among them only to be informed that they had determined to &s;end him to the Tower. But Cranmer was not to be intimi|dated by their menaces; he appealed to the king; and when that was denied him, he pro|duced a ring, which Henry had given him to make u&s;e of upon that emergency. The council was confounded; and &s;till more &s;o, when, in the pre&s;ence of the king, they found them&s;elves &s;everely reproved, and Cran|mer taken into more than former favour. Henry obliged them all to embrace as a &s;ign of their reconciliation; and Cranmer, from his gentle nature, rendered this reconciliation more &s;incere on his part than is u&s;ual in &s;uch forced compliances.</P>
<P>Still, however, the king's &s;everity to the re&s;t of his &s;ubjects continued as fierce as ever. For &s;ome time he had been imcommoded by an ulcer in his leg; the pain of which, added to his corpulence, and other infirmities, encrea&s;|ed his natural ira&s;cibility to &s;uch a degree, that &s;carce any, of even his dome&s;tics, approached
<PB N="410" REF="412">
him without terror. It was not to be expected, therefore, that any who differed from him in opinion, &s;hould, at this time particularly, hope for pardon. Among the many who&s;e unme|rited &s;ufferings excite our pity and indignation, the fate of Anne A&s;kew de&s;erves to be parti|cularly remembered. This lady was a woman of merit as well as beauty, and connected with many of the principal ladies at court. It is &s;aid that &s;he kept up a &s;ecret corre&s;pondence with the queen her&s;elf, who &s;ecretly favoured the reformation; and this corre&s;pondence only &s;erved to ha&s;ten this poor woman's ruin, the chancellor being known to be her enemy. However this be, &s;he happened to differ from the e&s;tabli&s;hed code of belief, particularly in the article of the real pre&s;ence; and, notwith|&s;tanding the weakne&s;s of her &s;ex and age, &s;he was thrown into pri&s;on, and accu&s;ed of here&s;y. In this &s;ituation, with courage far beyond what might be expected, &s;he employed her time in compo&s;ing prayers and di&s;cour&s;es, and vindicating the truth of her opinions. The chancellor, who was much attached to the ca|tholic party, was &s;ent to examine her with re|gard to her abettors at court; but &s;he main|tained the utmo&s;t &s;ecrecy, and would accu&s;e none. In con&s;equence of this contumacy, as
<PB N="411" REF="413">
it was called, the poor young lady was put to the torture; but &s;he &s;till continued re&s;olute, and her &s;ilence te&s;tified her contempt of their petty cruelties. The chancellor, therefore, became outrageous, and ordered the lieu|tenant of the Tower, who executed this pu|ni&s;hment, to &s;tretch the rack &s;till harder; which he refu&s;ing to do, and, though menaced, &s;till per&s;i&s;ting in a refu&s;al, the chancellor him&s;elf, intoxicated with religious zeal, gra&s;ped the cords him&s;elf, and drew it &s;o violently, that the woman's body was almo&s;t torn a&s;under. But her con&s;tancy was greater than the barbari|ty of her per&s;ecutors; &s;o that, finding no o|ther method to &s;ubdue her, &s;he was condemned to be burned alive. She received this &s;entence with a tran&s;port of joy, and as a relea&s;e from a &s;tate of the greate&s;t pain to the greate&s;t fe|licity. As all her joints had been di&s;located by the rack, &s;o that &s;he could not &s;tand, &s;he was carried to the place of execution in a chair. Together with her, were brought Nicholas Be|lenian a prie&s;t, John La&s;&s;als of the king's hou&s;|hold, and John Adams a taylor, who had all been condemned for the &s;ame crime. They were tied to the &s;take; and in that dreadful &s;i|tuation informed, that upon recanting, they &s;hould be granted their lives. But they re|fu&s;ed
<PB N="412" REF="414">
a life that was to be gained by &s;uch pro&s;titution; and they &s;aw, with tranquility, the executioner kindle the flames which con|&s;umed them.</P>
<P>From this indi&s;criminate &s;everity the queen was not her&s;elf entirely &s;ecure. She had for &s;ome time attended the king in his indi&s;po&s;i|tion, and endeavoured to &s;ooth him by her arts and a&s;&s;iduity. His favourite topic of con|ver&s;ation was theology, and Catharine, who was tinctured with the &s;pirit of the times, would now and then enter into a debate with him, upon many &s;peculative tenets, that were then in agitation between the Catholics and Luthe|rans. Henry, highly provoked that &s;he &s;hould pre&s;ume to differ from him, made complaints of her ob&s;tinacy to Gardiner, who gladly laid hold of the opportunity to enflame the quarrel. Even articles of impeachment were drawn up again&s;t her, which were brought to the king by the chancellor to be &s;igned; but in return|ing home, he happened to drop the paper. It was very lucky for the queen, that the per&s;on who found it was in her intere&s;ts; it was immediately carried to her, and the contents &s;oon made her &s;en&s;ible of the danger to which &s;he was expo&s;ed. In this exigence, &s;he was re&s;olved to work upon the king; and paying him her cu&s;tomary vi&s;it, he
<PB N="413" REF="415">
led her, as u&s;ual, to the &s;ubject of theology, which at fir&s;t &s;he &s;eemed to decline, but in which &s;he afterwards engaged, as if merely to gratify his inclinations. In the cour&s;e of her conver|&s;ation, however, &s;he gave him to know, that her whole aim in talking, was to receive his in&s;tructions, and not to controvert them; that it was not for her to &s;et her opinions in oppo|&s;ition to tho&s;e that &s;erved to direct the nation; but &s;he alledged, &s;he could not help trying every art that could induce the king to exert that eloquence which &s;erved, for the time, to mitigate his bodily pain. Henry &s;eemed charm|ed at this di&s;covery; <Q REND="inline">"And is it &s;o, &s;weet heart, cried he, then we are perfect friends again."</Q> Ju&s;t after this reconciliation, the chancellor made his appearance, with a party of forty pur&s;uivants at his heels, prepared to take the queen into cu&s;tody. But the king advan|ced to meet him; and &s;eemed to expo&s;tulate with him in the &s;evere&s;t terms. The queen could overhear the terms, knave, fool, and bea&s;t, which he very liberally be&s;towed upon that ma|gi&s;trate; and his being ordered to depart. When he was gone, &s;he interpo&s;ed in his de|fence; but the king could not help &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Poor &s;oul, you know not how little entitled this man is to your good offices."</Q> From thence|forth
<PB N="414" REF="416">
the queen was careful not to offend Hen|ry's humour by contradiction; &s;he was con|tented to &s;uffer the divines to di&s;pute, and the executioner to de&s;troy. The fires accordingly were kindled again&s;t the heretics of both &s;ides as u&s;ual, during which dreadful exhibitions, the king would frequently a&s;&s;emble the hou&s;es of parliament, and harangue them with florid orations, in which he would aver, that never prince had a greater affection for his people; nor ever people had a greater affection for their king. In every pau&s;e of the&s;e extraor|dinary orations, &s;ome of his creatures, near his per&s;on, would begin to applaud; and this was followed by loud acclamations, from all the re&s;t of the audience.</P>
<P>But though his health was declining apace, yet his implacable cruelties were not the le&s;s frequent. His re&s;entments were diffu&s;ed in|di&s;criminately to all; at one time a prote&s;tant, and at another a catholic, were the objects of his &s;everity. The duke of Norfolk and his &s;on, the earl of Surry, were the la&s;t that felt the inju&s;tice of the tyrant's groundle&s;s &s;u&s;pi|cions. The duke was a nobleman who had &s;erved the king with talents and fidelity; his &s;on was a young man of the mo&s;t promi&s;ing hopes, who excelled in every accompli&s;hment that became
<PB N="415" REF="417">
a &s;cholar, a courtier, and a &s;oldier. He ex|celled in all the military exerci&s;es, which were then in reque&s;t; he encouraged the fine arts by his practice and example; and it is remark|able, that he was the fir&s;t who brought our language, in his poetical pieces, to any degree of refinement. He celebrated the fair Geral|dina in all his &s;onnets, and maintained her &s;u|perior beauty in all places of public conten|tion. The&s;e qualifications, however, were no &s;afeguard to him again&s;t Henry's &s;u&s;picions; he had dropt &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of re&s;entment again&s;t the king's mini&s;ters, upon being di&s;|placed from the government of Boulogne; and the whole family was become obnoxious from the late incontinency of Catharine Howard, the queen who was executed. From the&s;e mo|tives, therefore, private orders were given to arre&s;t the father and &s;on; and accordingly they were arre&s;ted both on the &s;ame day, and con|fined to the Tower. Surry being a commoner, his trial was the more expeditious; and as to proofs, there were many informers ba&s;e enough to betray the intimacies of private confidence, and all the connections of blood. The dutche&s;s dowager of Richmond, Surry's own &s;i&s;ter, enli&s;ted her&s;elf among the number of his ac|cu&s;ers; and Sir Richard Southwell al&s;o, his
<PB N="416" REF="418">
mo&s;t intimate friend, charged him with infidelity to the king. It would &s;eem, that at this dreary period, there was neither faith, nor honour to be found in all the nation; Surry denied the charge, and challenged his accu&s;er to &s;ingle combat. This favour was refu&s;ed him; and it was alledged, that he had quartered the arms of Edward the Confe&s;&s;or on his e&s;cut|cheon, which alone was &s;ufficient to convict him of a&s;piring to the crown. To this he could make no reply; and indeed any an&s;wer would have been needle&s;s, for neither parliaments nor juries, during this reign, &s;eem to be guided by any other proofs, but the will of the crown. This young nobleman was, therefore, con|demned for high trea&s;on, notwith&s;tanding his eloquent and &s;pirited defence; and the &s;en|tence was &s;oon after executed upon him on Tower-Hill. In the mean time the duke en|deavoured to mollify the king by letters and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions; but the mon&s;ter's hard heart was rarely &s;ubject to tender impre&s;&s;ions. The parlia|ment,<MILESTONE N="1546" UNIT="A.D."> meeting on the fourteenth day of January, a bill of attainder was found again&s;t the duke of Norfolk; as it was thought he could not &s;o ea&s;ily have been convicted on a fair hearing by his peers. The only crime that his accu&s;ers could allege again&s;t him was, that he had once &s;aid,
<PB N="417" REF="419">
that the king was &s;ickly, and could not hold out long; and the kingdom was likely to be torn between the contending parties of differ|ent per&s;ua&s;ions. Cranmer, though engaged for many years in an oppo&s;ite party to Norfolk, and though he had received many and great injuries from him, would have no hand in &s;o unju&s;t a pro&s;ecution; but retired to his &s;eat at Croydon. However, the death warrant was made out, and immediately &s;ent to the lieute|nant of the Tower. The duke prepared for death, the following morning was to be his la&s;t; but an event of greater con&s;equence to the kingdom intervened, and prevented his exe|cution.</P>
<P>The king had been for &s;ome time approach|ing fa&s;t towards his end; and for &s;everal days all tho&s;e about his per&s;on plainly &s;aw that his &s;peedy death was inevitable, The di&s;order in his leg was now grown extremely painful; and this, added to his mon&s;trous corpulency, which rendered him unable to &s;tir, made him more furious than a chained lion. He had been ever &s;tern and &s;evere; he was now outrageous. In this &s;tate he hid continued for near four years before his death, the terror of all, and the tormentor of him&s;elf; his courtiers having no inclination to make an enemy of him, as
<PB N="418" REF="420">
they were more ardently employed in con&s;pir|ing the death of each other. In this manner, therefore, he was &s;uffered to &s;truggle, without any of his dome&s;tics having the courage to warn him of his approaching end, as more than once during this reign, per&s;ons had been put to death for foretelling the death of the king. At la&s;t, Sir Anthony Denny had the courage to di&s;clo&s;e to him this dreadful &s;ecret; and, contrary to his u&s;ual cu&s;tom, he received the tidings with an expre&s;&s;ion of re&s;ignation. His angui&s;h and remor&s;e was at this time greater than can be expre&s;&s;ed; he de&s;ired that Cran|mer might be &s;ent for; but before that prelate could arrive, he was &s;peechle&s;s. Cranmer de|&s;ired him to give &s;ome &s;ign of his dying in the faith of Chri&s;t, he &s;queezed his hand, and immediately expired, after a reign of thirty-&s;even years, and nine months, in the fifty-&s;ixth year of his age.<MILESTONE N="1547" UNIT="A.D."> Some kings have been ty|rants from contradiction and revolt; &s;ome from being mi&s;led by favourites, and &s;ome from a &s;pirit of party. But Henry was cruel from a depraved di&s;po&s;ition alone; cruel in government, cruel in religion, and cruel in his family. Our divines have taken &s;ome pains to vindicate the character of this brutal prince, as if his conduct, and our reformation
<PB N="419" REF="421">
had any connexion with each other. There is nothing &s;o ab&s;urd as to defend the one by the other; the mo&s;t noble de&s;igns are brought a|bout by the mo&s;t vicious in&s;truments; for we &s;ee even that cruelty and inju&s;tice were thought nece&s;&s;ary to be employed in our holy redemption.</P>
<P>With regard to foreign &s;tates, Henry made &s;ome expeditions into France, which were at|tended with va&s;t expence to the nation, and brought them no kind of advantage. How|ever, he all along maintained an intercour&s;e of friend&s;hip with Francis, which appeared di&s;intere&s;ted and &s;incere. Again&s;t the Scotch he was rather more &s;ucce&s;sful; his gene|rals having wor&s;ted their incur&s;ive armies on &s;everal occa&s;ions. They particularly gained a &s;ignal advantage, be&s;ide that already related of Floden field, at a place near Pinkey-Hou&s;e, in which near ten thou&s;and Scots were &s;lain. But that which gave England the greate&s;t a&s;cendency over that nation, was the &s;pirit of concord which &s;oon after &s;eemed to prevail be|tween the two kingdoms; and that &s;eemed to pave the way for their being in time united under the &s;ame &s;overeign. There were ten parliaments &s;ummoned in this reign, and twenty-three &s;e&s;&s;ions held; but the whole time
<PB N="420" REF="422">
in which the&s;e parliaments &s;at, during this long reign, did not exceed three years and an half. The foreign commerce of England, during this age, was mo&s;tly confined to the Netherlands. The merchants of the Low-Countries bought the Engli&s;h commodities, and di&s;tributed them into the other parts of Europe.
