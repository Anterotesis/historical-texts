<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS the following Sheets are written to un|deceive and quiet the Minds of the Peo|ple of this Nation in the Ca&s;e of the Re|nunciation mentioned in Her Maje&s;ties Speech to the Parliament, &s;o I could not let them come abroad into the World without taking &s;ome Notice of a Ca&s;e which has happened &s;ince the fini&s;hing the other, and which &s;ome People take hold off, to the Di&s;advantage of the Go|vernment, making &V;&s;e of it to encrea&s;e our unhappy Di&s;tractions in this Nation.</P>
<P>It was ob&s;erved by &s;ome, that when the Hou&s;e of Commons made their late Addre&s;s to Her Maje&s;ty no Mention was made therein of the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, and the Hou&s;e of <HI>Han|nover;</HI> this the Party, who&s;e peculiar Zeal &s;eems to have no other Way left to &s;hew it&s;elf, than in their continued repeating the Danger of the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, took hold of as a mighty Advantage, as if the Hou&s;e of <HI>Han|nover,</HI> the Succe&s;&s;ion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> had been purpo&s;ely affronted on that Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>But if they made &s;ome Noi&s;e on that Account, the Alarm they pretend to is doubled. Now
<PB REF="3">
when on a Motion made in the Hou&s;e the 7th of <HI>June,</HI> to Addre&s;s Her Maje&s;ty for the ma|king all the Confederates Guarantees of the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, <HI>it pa&s;&s;ed in the Nega|tive.</HI></P>
<P>This fills our Zealous <HI>Hannoverians, as they would be thought to be,</HI> with A&s;toni&s;h|ment, and with a feigned Sadne&s;s upon their Countenances they look at one another with Di&s;order and Amazement.</P>
<P>The Glo&s;s they put upon this is indeed very popular, as if they did fore&s;ee the Pre|tender coming in at the Breach this has made; and that becau&s;e the Hou&s;e would not put Her Maje&s;ty upon the mo&s;t Incongruous and Incon|&s;i&s;tent Step in the World, Needle&s;s to us, and Irrational in its&s;elf, but pretended to be for the Propagation of the Intere&s;t of the Succe&s;&s;ion, that therefore the Hou&s;e of Commons &s;hould be Enemies to the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t, and to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hannover.</HI></P>
<P>The Hou&s;e indeed have acted in this with their wonted Prudence, and the Vote they have pa&s;&s;ed is certainly a much &s;tronger Te&s;timony of their firm Adherence to the <HI>Hannover</HI> Succe&s;|ce&s;&s;ion, than that Addre&s;s could have been, <HI>(viz.)</HI> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That they have an entire Confidence in Her Maje&s;ty, and cannot doubt but that &s;he will take all needful Cautions for the Security of the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Han|nover,</HI>' &amp;c.</Q>  as may be &s;een in the Votes, <HI>June</HI> the 19th.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">The Antient Law-maker, <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> being asked why be made no Law again&s;t Paricide, gave this wi&s;e An&s;wer, that he would not have &s;uch a Crime named among his Citizens; nor would he &s;ugge&s;t that any of his Citizens were capable of &s;o much Degeneracy of Nature as to be guilty of it, and therefore he made no Puni&s;h|ment for it. By this the wi&s;e Legi&s;lator put a greater Brand of Infamy upon the Crime than he could po&s;&s;ibly have done, by making the &s;evere|e&s;t Law again&s;t it imaginable.</P>
<P>The like is the Conduct of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, who having put this as a Matter they think lyes &s;o near, and is &s;o much Her Maje&s;ties Concern, as that it is impo&s;&s;ible She &s;hould for|get to &s;ecure it, they have thereby more effectu|ally obliged Her Maje&s;ty to take that Part upon Her&s;elf, than they could have done by leading Her to the Ways and Means the&s;e People have pre&s;cribed them.</P>
<P>The Expre&s;&s;ion they have now u&s;ed to Her Maje&s;ty by their &s;aid Vote implies mo&s;t &s;trong|ly Two Things. <LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion is a Thing of the highe&s;t Concern to the Nation; &s;o great that it would be undutiful and unnatural in them to &s;uppo&s;e Her Maje&s;ty could &s;o far neglect &s;uch an E&s;&s;ential and Fundamental Part of Her Peoples Safety, as to Want that they &s;hould remind her of it, and therefore they &s;ay <HI>they cannot doubt it.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the entire Confidence the Commons place in Her Maje&s;ties Zeal for Her Peoples
<PB REF="5">
Good, is the greate&s;t Obligation that a faithful People can put upon their Sovereign, to do all that can po&s;&s;ibly be done in the Thing it&s;elf, and much &s;tronger in all Re&s;pects than &s;uch an Addre&s;s could have been.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>So that upon the whole it &s;eems, that the Settlement of the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion is &s;o far from having receiv'd any Shock by the Negative of the afore&s;aid Vote, that in every Impartial Eye it mu&s;t rather have Weight added to it; and Her Maje&s;ty is farther loaded with Obliga|tions to &s;ecure it, if that be po&s;&s;ible, than She was before.</P>

<HEAD>THE VALIDITY OF THE RENUNCIATIONS OF Former Powers, Enquired into, AND THE Pre&s;ent Renunciation OF THE Duke of <HI>ANJOU,</HI> Impartially Con&s;idered.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been the received Maxim of the Pre&s;ent Age, that no Peace can be Safe or Honourable while any Part of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy remains in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon.</HI> The Votes, and
<PB N="2" REF="7">
Unanimous Addre&s;&s;es, of both Hou&s;es of Parliament Here, the frequent Declarations of our Allies Abroad, and the Speeches of our Sovereign from the Throne, together with infinite other Circum&s;tances in Trea|ties, in Conferences, Mi&s;&s;ives, Memorials, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have both at Home and Abroad con|curred to Print this Notion &s;o indelibly in the Minds of the common People, that it appears very difficult to remove their Thoughts, or bring them to under&s;tand or conceive of any other Mea&s;ures, or the Rea&s;ons which may have been given, or pretended, for differing Mea&s;ures. But Time has taught us to &s;ee, that neither the Opinion of Princes, or Parliaments, are &s;o infallible, as not to be Subject to the Mu|tations and Alterations, which the Accidents of Government, and the Revolutions of Na|tions, bring upon them; and that which may to Day be e&s;teemed dangerous and impracticable, to Morrow becomes not only &s;afe but nece&s;&s;ary; &s;o that it cea&s;es to be an Argument again&s;t a Thing to &s;ay, that &s;uch was the Opinion of &s;uch or &s;uch, at &s;uch or &s;uch a Time; for as Circum&s;tances alter, the Judgments of Men will and ought to be altered.</P>
<P>This &s;eems the Ca&s;e in the Affair of Peace now on the Stage, and which I am here to enquire into; in the Examination whereof, I &s;hall, with the utmo&s;t Impartiality, &s;earch into the Thing it&s;elf, its Nature and Cir|cum&s;tances,
<PB N="3" REF="8">
without taking any Advanta|ges from the Mea&s;ures now in Hand, or the Quality of the Per&s;ons who&s;e Sanction is added to give Authority to the Opinion. It &s;hall be of no Weight in this Ca&s;e that Her Maje&s;ties Speech &s;ays &s;o or &s;o, it &s;hall not be brought as an Argument that the Government are &s;atisfied with the&s;e Mea|&s;ures, or that the Pre&s;ent Mini&s;try have carried this Thing on upon &s;uch and &s;uch a Foundation, the true Merits of this Cau&s;e &s;hall, according to the Title of this Tract, be impartially con&s;idered, and every Thing therein be weighed with the utmo&s;t Calm|ne&s;s, and Coolne&s;s of Rea&s;oning, that no|thing may Bya&s;s the Reader, either for or again&s;t one Way or other, but Matters of Fact placed in the cleare&s;t Light po&s;&s;i|ble.</P>
<P>The Terms of the Peace which is now to be made with <HI>France</HI> are at large &s;et down in Her Maje&s;ties Speech, the quoting them from thence &s;erves not to give them any Sanction in the pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e, more than the Certainty that tho&s;e are the Real Terms now in Debate, which Certainty has never till now been determined by any un|di&s;puted Authority.</P>
<P>By the&s;e Terms it is allowed, that, con|trary to all which has hitherto been Voted, Declared, or Concluded among us here, the Kingdoms of Old <HI>Spain,</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> are Given, or Allotted, to <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Bourbon,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="9">
Duke of <HI>Anjou,</HI> now <HI>Philip</HI> V. King of <HI>Spain,</HI> which is the Fir&s;t and Main Point in Di&s;pute.</P>
<P>The Contradiction this Step taken now, bears to the former Re&s;olutions, Declarati|ons, and Determinations of this Govern|ment, and of the Confederates, and how it is brought to be con&s;i&s;tent with the Words Safe and Honourable, &s;o long and &s;o often in&s;i&s;ted on before, depends upon the Novel|ty of the following Circum&s;tances. The King of <HI>France,</HI> a Subtil and Politick Prince, had boldly adventured to break off the Treaty at <HI>Geertruydenbergh,</HI> although his Af|fairs were then in but a very low and threat|ning Po&s;ture; he had found it more difficult to manage the Confederates at a Treaty than it had formerly been; and the Councils of <HI>France</HI> began to apprehend Evil Con&s;e|quences from the en&s;uing Campaign; all they had for it was, that their Troops in <HI>Spain</HI> were in a pretty good Condition, and the Duke <HI>de Vendo&s;me,</HI> a Commander of Reputation, having joined the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ar|my with 5 Brigades of <HI>French</HI> Infantry, and about 2500 <HI>French</HI> Hor&s;e, they had &s;ome Hopes of putting a Stop to the Troops of King <HI>Charles,</HI> who after the Battle of of <HI>Sarago&s;&s;a</HI> had found the <HI>Ca&s;tilians</HI> not &s;o much in his Intere&s;t as he expected, and be|gan to be in Want of all Things, having his Troops di&s;per&s;ed, many Towns of Im|portance to keep Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, and the
<PB N="5" REF="10">
Rivers, Pa&s;&s;es, and open Country, po&s;&s;e&s;t by the <HI>French,</HI> &s;o that they began to think of drawing together in a Body, and re|treating towards the Frontiers of <HI>Arragon:</HI> In <HI>Flanders,</HI> and everywhere el&s;e, the ut|mo&s;t the <HI>French</HI> could propo&s;e to do, was to act upon the Defen&s;ive, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to keep the Confederates from be&s;ieging <HI>Arras</HI> or St. <HI>Omer.</HI></P>
<P>They &s;ucceeded however in the&s;e Things beyond Expectation, the Campaign in <HI>Flanders</HI> ended with the &s;ingle Lo&s;s of <HI>Bou|chain,</HI> and in <HI>Spain</HI> the Duke <HI>de Vendo&s;me</HI> had the Satisfaction of Surrounding the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Troops in <HI>Briheugha,</HI> beating Count <HI>Staremberg</HI>'s Left Wing at <HI>Villa Vico&s;a,</HI> and pu&s;hing the whole <HI>German</HI> Army back to <HI>Catalonia,</HI> taking from them all the Ca&s;tles and Pa&s;&s;es they had &s;eized, be&s;ieging <HI>Gi|ronne,</HI> taking <HI>Balaguer, Cervera,</HI> and in brief, pu&s;hing the <HI>Germans</HI> into the very City of <HI>Barcelona,</HI> where the Duke threa|tened to Be&s;iege them in the Spring Cam|paign.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things buoyed up the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Affairs to &s;uch a Height, as made the War &s;eem more fixed, and Peace more remote, than ever, when on a &s;udden an Accident fell in, which gave a new Turn to all the Affairs of <HI>Europe</HI>; for Heaven, who &s;eemed before to have left the Cau&s;e to the Arm of Fle&s;h, and who &s;uffered the &s;everal Nations to depend whol|ly
<PB N="6" REF="11">
upon their Swords; yet now all on a &s;uddain, took the Cau&s;e into his own Hand, and taught both Sides, that the Views they had either Way were not agreeable to him, but that other Mea&s;ures were to be taken to &s;ettle the Peace of <HI>Europe,</HI> than tho&s;e of War Conque&s;t, and De&s;truction of Man|kind: In Pur&s;uance of the&s;e Mea&s;ures, Death was &s;ent with his Black Expre&s;s to Sum|mon out of the World the &s;everal Per&s;ons, who&s;e being in the World prevented either Side from &s;eeing their own Intere&s;t, and from knowing wherein the Peace of <HI>Europe</HI> really con&s;i&s;ted On the Confederate Side the Stroke began with the Emperor, who&s;e Death, without Male I&s;&s;ue, made Way on one Hand for the Advancement of King <HI>Charles</HI> to the <HI>Imperial</HI> Dignity, but at the &s;ame Time gave new Pro&s;pects, and new Schemes, to the Politicks of <HI>Europe,</HI> cooled &s;everal of the Powers and Princes of the Confederacy in their Pur&s;uit of the War, from the ju&s;t Apprehen&s;ion of lodging a dangerous Superiority of Power in the Hands of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> a Family who had been &s;o ju&s;tly dreaded by a great Part of the Chri&s;tian World in the Fifteenth Cen|tury, and who&s;e Power, as the <HI>French</HI> has done now, had employed all the Powers, and engag'd almo&s;t all the Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> in a long War for above Forty Years.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="12">At the &s;ame Time that this blow gave <HI>France</HI> &s;ome Hopes of new Mea&s;ures, and that a Peace might be made on a differing Poot than before, Death falls furiou&s;ly on the Royal Family of <HI>France,</HI> takes away Three Dauphines, the immediate Succe&s;&s;ors to the Crown, and the Dauphine&s;s, Wife of the Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and Daughter of the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and all the&s;e within the Compa&s;s of One Year. There now remain|ed but One of the Children of the Family between the Crown of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and this an Infant of about One Year and half old; the Fortune of <HI>France,</HI> weak like the State, and not in the Judgment, even of Phy&s;icians them&s;elves, likely to live long; this Blow, tho' it very &s;en&s;ibly affected the Old Monarch, yet it immediately put him upon new Mea&s;ures with the Confederates; Two Schemes lay in his View, One, in Ca&s;e the little Dau|phine &s;hould die before the other could be brought to Perfection, was the tendring the Crown and Monarchy of <HI>Spain</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI>; which, as it might be acceptable enough to &s;ome of the Confederates, yet was much the Intere&s;t of <HI>France</HI> to manage it &s;o as that the Duke &s;hould owe his Advance|ment to the Court of <HI>France,</HI> and not to the Confederates; by which Means, if the Emperor, and his Allies, &s;hould oppo&s;e it, as no doubt &s;ome of them would be per|&s;waded, he was &s;ure on one Hand to bring
<PB N="8" REF="13">
the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> off from the Confedera|cy, and on the other Hand &s;hould be able to carry the War again into <HI>Italy</HI>; and by attempting to put the Duke in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Spain,</HI> might keep &s;uch a Share in the Dominions and Commerce of <HI>Spain,</HI> as &s;hould be for his Purpo&s;e. The Second Scheme, founded upon the Suppo&s;ition of the Life of the little Dauphine for a while, was to oblige King <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> to a formal Renunciation of his Claim to the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> tho' the &s;ame &s;hould fall by the Death of the pre&s;ent Dauphine, and that the Duke of <HI>Berry</HI> &s;hould be declared Dauphine in Ca&s;e of the Death of the &s;aid pre&s;ent Dauphine, and the Crown to de|&s;cend to him and his Heirs.</P>
<P>This Scheme had &s;everal Views, but principally to obviate the great Objection which was made on all Occa&s;ions by the Confederates, and which &s;eem'd to be the Foundation of the War, <HI>viz.</HI> the Danger of uniting the Kingdoms of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> in one and the &s;ame Per&s;on.</P>
<P>It &s;eems needle&s;s to repeat here the Dif|ficulty <HI>France</HI> had found to bring the Con|federates to enter upon any &s;uch a Thing as a Treaty: After her rejecting the Preli|minaries, and breaking off the Sub&s;equent Treaties at <HI>Geertruydenbergh,</HI> it &s;eem'd as if the Confederates were re&s;olv'd to have no Peace at all, but to pu&s;h at the Ruin of the <HI>French</HI> Monarchy, or that they were &s;o con|fident
<PB N="9" REF="14">
of their Strength as, that they re&s;olved to oblige <HI>France</HI> to offer <HI>Charte Blanc,</HI> and beg Peace, as we u&s;e to &s;ay, on their Knees: But <HI>France</HI> found out a Way to convince &s;ome of the Confederates that their Affairs were not brought &s;o very low; and the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Court, as well moved with the Di&s;|order of their own People, as tired with the unequal Burthen of the War, which had lain on them &s;o heavy and &s;o long, began to &s;hew an Inclination to renew a Treaty. The Court of <HI>France</HI> fail'd not to lay hold of the Occa&s;ion, and obtaining Leave at the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Court to make New Propo&s;als, a Mini&s;ter was accordingly &s;ent over thi|ther, who having on the Part of <HI>France</HI> made Propo&s;als for treating of a General Peace in the u&s;ual Manner, and promi&s;ing largely to give Rea&s;onable Satisfaction to all the Allies, Her Maje&s;ty was prevailed with to interpo&s;e her Intere&s;t and Autho|rity to obtain an Appointment, and a Place was accordingly named, (<HI>viz.</HI>) <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> the particular Hi&s;tory of which is not to the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, and therefore is omitted here. The Difficulties which many of the Confederates &s;tarted, and the Oppo&s;ition they made to the Propo&s;al of a Treaty, are too publickly known to need that I repeat them here. But their Management at the Treaty when they came there, will take up &s;ome Room in the future Hi&s;tory of that Affair, and may be briefly hinted at
<PB N="10" REF="15">
here. The Imperial Court was long er'e they re&s;olv'd to &s;end any Plenipotentiaries at all; the <HI>States-General</HI> appointed Four Mini&s;ters, tho' as &s;ome reported they were rather Commi&s;&s;ioners than Plenipotentiaries or Amba&s;&s;adors, and at length with great Difficulty the Treaty began; Papers of Specific Demands were given in on either Hand, when according to the u&s;ual Method of Treaties it was expected the Conferences among the Plenipotentiaries &s;hould have begun, and each Party &s;hould have de|bated their own Preten&s;ions, when on a &s;udden the <HI>Imperial</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Plenipoten|tiaries, or Mini&s;ters, refu&s;ed ab&s;olutely to treat by Conference, but demanded An&s;wers in Writing of the <HI>French:</HI> The <HI>French</HI> were &s;urpriz'd at this Demand, alledging, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That they had given in their Propo&s;als to the Confederates at fir&s;t, and received the Demands of the Confederates, and they were ready to enter upon the Par|ticulars by Conference, according to the u&s;ual Methods of Treaties: That An|&s;wers in Writing tended only to prolong Time, and to &s;et the whole World ma|king their popular U&s;e of them: That &s;ome of the Confederate Mini&s;ters had made u&s;e of the former Propo&s;al to exa&s;|perate the re&s;t of their Allies, and to irri|the People again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> without entring into the particular Explications which they were ready to make of every
<PB N="11" REF="16">
Head, and had di&s;covered that they came not with a De&s;ign to carry on a Treaty, but to find an Occa&s;ion to break off the Treaty: That there was no manner of Pretence for demanding more An&s;wers in Writing, but to have them Printed in every Country, with &s;uch Repre&s;enta|tions, however fal&s;e, as their Enemies thought fit to make of them, and there|by to animate their People for carrying on their particular De&s;igns; that as to a Peace, if it was &s;incerely intended, there could be no Occa&s;ion for further writing of Papers or Propo&s;als, &s;ince they were all upon the Spot ready to enter into Conference with every Mini&s;ter upon the particular Demands of their Principals, in order to give Satisfaction to every one.'</Q> Now indeed the other Mini&s;ters had &s;ome Debates, and the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Plenipotentiaries, according to the Queen's Real Intention, thought it was mo&s;t rea&s;onable to avoid Delays, and to bring Things to a Head, that they &s;hould enter on the Treaty by Confe|rence; but they were over-ruled, and the Majority in&s;i&s;ting upon the afore&s;aid De|mand, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that the <HI>French</HI> &s;hould give in their An&s;wer in Writing to the Demands of the Allies, the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters &s;ubmitted, and the <HI>French</HI> Mini&s;ters in&s;i&s;ting on it, and in particular, that they had no In&s;tru|ctions on that Head, all the Conferences broke off, and the Treaty &s;eem'd to be at a
<PB N="12" REF="17">
full Stop. Here it was that the Mini&s;ters of &s;ome of the Allies di&s;covered that their Bu&s;ine&s;s at <HI>&V;trecht</HI> was not to Treat, but to put a Stop to the Treaty; and that they laid hold of every Occa&s;ion to interrupt and prevent the Proceedings, much more the Conclu&s;ion, of any &s;uch Thing as a Treaty of Peace; for the &s;aid Mini&s;ters thinking they had effectually gained their Point, did not &s;tick to be very open upon this Head: But they have been di&s;appointed in this De|&s;ign, as they have been in many more, by the Vigilance and Conduct of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters; for Her Maje&s;ty finding this Secret Management of the &s;aid Mini&s;ters pu&s;h'd plainly at de&s;troying all the Hopes of a Peace by interrupting the Conferences, took Occa&s;ion to let them know &s;he would not be bound Apprentice to the War at the Will and Plea&s;ure of the Allies, but that &s;ince all which &s;he was en|gaged to fight for, and on which as a Foun|dation the War was begun, being to be ob|tained by a Peace, the Obligation to carry on the War cea&s;ed; neither could any Chri|&s;tian Prince ju&s;tifie the carrying on a De|&s;tructive War, and the Shedding &s;o much Blood, if the Rea&s;onable Satisfaction for which the War was begun might be ob|tain'd without it.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="18">Upon the&s;e Ju&s;t and Rational Principles the Queen of <HI>Great Britain</HI> proceeded to ad|ju&s;t with the <HI>French</HI> the Conditions of Peace which Her Maje&s;ty thought fit to demand for Her own Subjects, with mo&s;t of which the <HI>French</HI> having complied, there only remains the Satisfaction which Her Maje&s;ty demands for the re&s;t of Her Allies; and here it is to be remark'd, for the Conviction of &s;uch as have reproached the Queen with for&s;aking her Engagements and Alliances, that albeit Her Maje&s;ty might with good Rea&s;on have left the Allies to make the be&s;t Terms they could with <HI>France</HI> after Her own Terms were adju&s;ted as above, they having offered to impo&s;e the War upon Her in a Manner altogether unju&s;tifiable, yet Her Maje&s;ty, far from &s;uffering Her&s;elf to be guided by Her Re&s;entments, however Ju&s;t, has neverthele&s;s made the Intere&s;t of the Allies Her own in every Particular, and has forgotten no Material Demand which &s;he thought fit for them to ask, or <HI>France</HI> to grant to them, but has in&s;i&s;ted upon the &s;ame Demands which the &s;aid Confederates had made before, &s;o far as Her Maje&s;ty &s;aw a Rea&s;on &s;ufficient to demand the &s;ame.</P>

of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and for which the People of <HI>Britain</HI> have a great Rea&s;on, not only to Ble&s;s Her Maje&s;ties Concern for the Good and Pro&s;perity of Her own Subjects and Kingdoms, but al&s;o to be very glad that the &s;aid Peace was not concluded in former Treaties, where it was ob&s;ervable that no Provi&s;ion was made for the Commerce or Intere&s;t of the People of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>; but all the Intere&s;t of <HI>Britain</HI> employed in obtaining Powers and Advantages for the Confederates, and for promoting the Inte|re&s;ts, and Greatne&s;s, and Securities, of the Emperor and the States-General, upon Sup|po&s;ition that all our Security and Greatne&s;s was contained in the &s;pecial and particular Intere&s;ts of tho&s;e Powers, without any o|ther Provi&s;ions for our own.</P>
<P>The&s;e particular Advantages to <HI>Britain</HI> now obtain'd by this Treaty appears by a Scheme of a Peace laid by Her Maje&s;ty be|fore Her Parliament, <HI>June</HI> 6. 1712, in Her late Speech, and are as follows.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. A Treaty of Commerce entred upon, and brought to this Perfection between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>France, viz.</HI> that the re&s;t being referr'd to a farther Regulation, in the mean Time <HI>the &s;ame Priviledges and Advantages as &s;hall be granted to any other Nation by</HI> France <HI>&s;hall be granted in like Manner to us.</HI> This is more than ei|ther was propos'd at the Treaty of the
<PB N="15" REF="20">
Preliminaries, or was obtain'd by the Treaty of <HI>Re&s;wick,</HI> all being left there to a Future Treaty of Commerce, without putting that Treaty into any Method, or making any previous Conditions, as above, for the maintaining the Advantages of <HI>Britain</HI> equal with other Nations in <HI>France.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The putting the whole I&s;land of Sr. <HI>Chri|&s;tophers</HI> into the Hands of the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>: This is altogether New; nor is the Advantage &s;o incon&s;iderable as not to be very well worth Her Maje&s;ties Concern to demand, and our Satisfaction in obtaining; the Partition of that I&s;land between us and the <HI>French</HI> having not on|ly occa&s;ioned much Dammage and Blood, but at la&s;t the utter Ruin of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Settlement on that I&s;land, and of the poor Planters there, by the cruel Deva&s;tation of the <HI>French.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Security and Ea&s;e of our Colonies in <HI>North-America</HI> have likewi&s;e in former Treaties been too much forgotten, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies in <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s <HI>Bay</HI> entirely ruined and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the <HI>French,</HI> even in time of Peace; the <HI>Newfoundland</HI> Trade has been invaded, and almo&s;t lo&s;t, the <HI>French</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the Fort of <HI>Placentia,</HI> and the chief of the Fi&s;hing, and the &s;aid Fort of <HI>Placentia</HI> not being at all re&s;tored in any former Treaty, we &s;hall now be ab&s;olute Ma&s;ters of the Beaver Trade
<PB N="16" REF="21">
to <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s <HI>Bay,</HI> and the <HI>Newfoundland</HI> Fi&s;hing, and the Colony of <HI>New-England, &amp;c.</HI> will be more particularly be &s;ecured and made &s;afe, by removing the <HI>French</HI> from <HI>Accadia, Nova Scotia,</HI> &amp;c. where they became very trouble&s;ome Neigh|bours.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The I&s;land of <HI>Minorca</HI> in the <HI>Mediterra|nean</HI> is a Thing &s;o Con&s;iderable to us as it cannot ea&s;ily be judg'd of till future Oc|ca&s;ions make it better under&s;tood, not &s;o much for the Advantage of Dominion on the I&s;land it&s;elf, tho' that is not incon&s;i|derable, as for the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the great|e&s;t and be&s;t Harbour in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> in which not only the Merchants of <HI>Bri|tain</HI> will always have Shelter and Prote|ction, but where Her Maje&s;ty's Fleet may on all Occa&s;ions have a Station, a Retreat, a &s;afe and commodious Harbour in Ca&s;e of War, e&s;pecially in Ca&s;e of War with the <HI>Algerines, Tripolins, Tuni&s;eens,</HI> and other Rovers of <HI>Barbary,</HI> who&s;e Coa&s;t is direct|ly oppo&s;ite to the &s;aid I&s;land of <HI>Minorca.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The Town and Fortifications of <HI>Gibraltar</HI> are &s;o good an Equivalent for the Lo&s;s of <HI>Tangier</HI> in former Times, that it is hoped the Remembrance of the la&s;t may be for|gotten in the much greater Advantages of the former, without either the Expence or the Blood that always attended the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Tangier,</HI> and the U&s;efulne&s;s
<PB N="17" REF="22">
of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a Road, and a Town in the very Entrance of the <HI>Straights,</HI> is too well under&s;tood to need any farther Enquiry about it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. The &s;ecuring to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Merchants all the Advantages, Rights and Priviledges, of Trade in <HI>Spain,</HI> that &s;hall be granted to any other Nation: This takes away that General Notion, which was, that a Dif|ference &s;hould be made between the Sub|jects of <HI>France,</HI> and tho&s;e of other Nati|ons in <HI>Spain,</HI> with re&s;pect to Trade, to the Advantage of the <HI>French.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>7. The la&s;t Advantage of Trade we are to ob&s;erve in this New Treaty, is the <HI>A&s;&s;i|ento,</HI> or Contract with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> for furni&s;hing the <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies</HI> with Negroes for Thirty Years; this &s;peaks it|&s;elf, and needs not that I &s;hould add any Thing but what is Natural, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that it is an Encrea&s;e of Trade to the <HI>Brit&s;h</HI> Mer|chants and Traders to <HI>Africa</HI> of &s;uch a Con&s;equence, that we &s;hall, no Que&s;ti|on, improve to a very great Degree.</ITEM>

<P>The&s;e Seven are Particulars wholly left out or very much neglected in all the former Arti|cles, of whatever Kind, which we have yet &s;een tran&s;acted with the <HI>French</HI>; and which at lea&s;t may afford us this Deduction, <HI>viz.</HI> that Her Maje&s;ty has been ju&s;t &s;o much more concern'd for the Good of Her own

<P>Come we now to enquire into the General Security, and the Publick Peace and Intere&s;t of <HI>Europe: The Ballance of Power</HI> has been al|ways laid down as the Fir&s;t and mo&s;t E&s;&s;en|tial Thing to be provided for, as that on which the Safety of <HI>Europe</HI> depended and as the only Method which could be found out to prevent the Exorbitant Greatne&s;s of <HI>France,</HI> and keep him from Over-running the re&s;t of Chri&s;tendom, and to keep up the general Harmony among the re&s;t of the Powers of <HI>Europe.</HI> This Ballance of Power was thought to be effectually de&s;troyed by the Seizing of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy into the Hands of a Branch of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon</HI>; by which was mo&s;t ju&s;tly apprehended, that in Con|&s;equence of the u&s;ual Methods of the <HI>French</HI> Government, the Great and Powerful Mo|narchies of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>France</HI> &s;hould imme|diately be united in the &s;ame Per&s;on, which would be the apparent Ruin of the Peace of <HI>Europe.</HI> To prevent this Melancholy View of the Publick Affairs of <HI>Europe,</HI> the other Powers of that Part of <HI>Europe</HI> princi|pally concerned took Arms, and joined with the <HI>Imperial</HI> Armies, which were then entred upon Action again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> the Em|peror

That the effectual e&s;tabli&s;hing a Bal|lance of Power in <HI>Europe,</HI> is the real End and De&s;ign of the War; Her Maje&s;ties De|claration of War, and the Declarations of the Princes and Powers now engaged in this War, together with the Grand Alli|ance among the Confederates, will all te&s;ti|fie in Defence of this Propo&s;ition; and to them I refer my Reader, wherein the Li|berty of <HI>Europe,</HI> the Publick Tranquility, the Ballance of <HI>Europe,</HI> are Terms u&s;ed to
<PB N="30" REF="35">
&s;ignifie the &s;ame Thing, and are all along made U&s;e of as the Rea&s;ons of the War, as in Her Maje&s;ties Declaration of War, <HI>May</HI> 4. 1702, and likewi&s;e, in the Declaration or <HI>Manife&s;to</HI> of the States-General, <HI>May</HI> 8. 1702.</P>
<P>Many the like might be produced, to prove, if it were needful, that the&s;e were the true Grounds of the War, but this be|ing &s;ufficient, I pa&s;s to the next Head, <HI>viz.</HI> 2 <HI>That effectual dividing the Intere&s;t of</HI> France <HI>and</HI> Spain, <HI>is the only way to pre&s;erve or re&s;tore the Ballance of Power in</HI> Europe. This al&s;o is as evident from the Cour&s;e of the whole War; the &s;etting up King <HI>Charles</HI> as King of <HI>Spain</HI> had no other Foundation, for he had at that Time no Pretence to Claim the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> his Elder Brother being alive, and having Children to &s;ucceed; but the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> was allotted to him on this very Foundation, that the Monarchy of <HI>France</HI> might have nothing to do with the Dominions of <HI>Spain,</HI> in all the Treaties that have been &s;et on Foot on every Hand, for the putting an End to the War; this has been the Foundation of all the re&s;t, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that the Kingdoms of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> might not come into the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame Prince. Nay, the King of <HI>France</HI> him&s;elf has acknowledged it to be a ju&s;t Foundation, and has made it the Foot upon which he has always made his Propo&s;als of Peace, as is apparent from the
<PB N="31" REF="36">
late Propo&s;als, called the Six Preliminaries, wherein he owns, in expre&s;s Terms, that it is not &s;afe for <HI>Europe</HI> that <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> &s;hould come to be Governed by the &s;ame Per&s;on, at the &s;ame Time, and there|fore propo&s;es to give &s;ufficient Security to the Allies that &s;uch a Thing &s;hould never happen. This Maxim is deduced from the former, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the pre&s;erving the Bal|lance of Power in <HI>Europe,</HI> and is the main Point for which this Bloody War has been &s;o long carried on.</P>
<P>But all the Schemes for bringing this to pa&s;s have hitherto proved ineffectual, the War hath proved tedious and tire&s;ome, and the Nations have been exhau&s;ted to &s;uch a Degree by it, that the Subjects on every Side call for Peace; the <HI>French,</HI> tho' pu&s;hed with great Succe&s;s, and with infinite Lo&s;&s;es every Year, yet lo&s;e their Ground by Inch|es; Twice they have beaten the Confede|rates out of <HI>Spain,</HI> although they had po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed even the Capital City, and the Prin|cipal Provinces, and they &s;till appear in a Formidable Po&s;ture on the Frontiers; &s;o that it &s;eems to be &s;till the Work of many Years to Reduce them. On the other Hand, the &s;everal Offers <HI>France</HI> has made of evacuating <HI>Spain,</HI> has been look'd upon as un&s;afe, or in&s;incere. But Providence having removed the Princes of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon</HI> on the one Hand, and brought King <HI>Charles</HI> to the <HI>Imperial</HI> Dignity on the
<PB N="32" REF="37">
other, by which it appears, that the &s;ame Rea&s;ons for &s;ettling the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> on his Head doth not exi&s;t as before; and that it might be equally dangerous to <HI>Eu|rope</HI> to make one and the &s;ame Per&s;on Em|peror, and King of <HI>Spain,</HI> as King of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI>; the &s;aid Ballance of <HI>Eu|rope</HI> being thereby de&s;troyed as much the one Way as the other; this being the Ca&s;e a new Expedient offers, (<HI>viz</HI>) to make a new E&s;tabli&s;hment, or Entail, of the &s;e|veral Crowns of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI>; &s;o that the Intere&s;ts of &s;everal Princes might be ren|dered Incompatible, and that it might ap|pear divided in tho&s;e Intere&s;ts; &s;o that it being naturally impo&s;&s;ible for them to agree as to Soveraignity, the Peace of <HI>Europe</HI> might be &s;ecured as the Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>To bring this to pa&s;s, mutual Renuncia|tions have been al&s;o needful; but as the&s;e Things called Renunciations have &s;uffered &s;ome Scandal in the Eyes of the Confede|rates, it might be expected the Oppo&s;ers of Peace would immediately object again&s;t the very Word it&s;elf as un&s;atisfactory. But con&s;idering Men always di&s;tingui&s;h of Mat|ters in order to judge rightly; and in do|ing this it will appear, that as in Her Maje|&s;ties Speech it is ob&s;erved, this Treaty executes it&s;elf; &s;o that the Validity of this Article does not <HI>&s;o much</HI> con&s;i&s;t in the Validity of the Renunciation, as the Validity of the Re|nunciation depends upon the Nature of the
<PB N="33" REF="38">
Thing; for Example, &s;uppo&s;ing the Crown of <HI>France</HI> falls, as may be &s;aid, by De&s;cent to the pre|&s;ent <HI>Philip,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Berry</HI> being declared <HI>Dau|phin</HI> by Virtue of this Treaty, and being immedi|ately in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> no Man can think &s;o ab&s;urdly as to &s;uppo&s;e he will demit to his Brother <HI>Philip,</HI> who al&s;o has given up his Right. Nor can any Man &s;ugge&s;t that <HI>Philip</HI> can force him to it, after he is in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; for it will always be allowed, that there will be a great Diffe|rence between a King of <HI>Spain</HI> renouncing <HI>France,</HI> and a King of <HI>France</HI> renouncing <HI>Spain,</HI> as to the Power of forcing their Preten&s;ions. This then being the Ca&s;e here, there remains no more Diffi|culty, but that the Circum&s;tances of the Two Per|&s;ons will effectually divide the Kingdoms; for if the Duke of <HI>Berry,</HI> who is the younger Brother, keeps the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> not the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> would be more incon&s;i&s;tent with his Intere&s;t, than his Brother <HI>Philip,</HI> who cannot but with Regret &s;ee him e&s;tabli&s;hed on a Throne, which was his Birth|right, and which he had, with <HI>E&s;au,</HI> given up for a Me&s;s of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Pottage.</P>
<P>The Renunciation, join'd with Want of Power, has double Efficacy in this Ca&s;e; and I &s;ee nothing remaining to doubt the Duke of <HI>Berry</HI> being able to maintain him&s;elf again&s;t <HI>Philip,</HI> unle&s;s we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e a Faction in <HI>France</HI> to Favour King <HI>Philip,</HI> which con&s;idering the ab&s;olute Dominions of the Kings of <HI>France</HI> is al&s;o not very probable; but if this &s;hould happen, then are all the Confederates engaged as Allies to the Duke of <HI>Berry</HI> to &s;upport him in his Claim, and &s;o <HI>France, Britain, Holland,</HI> and the <HI>Empire,</HI> are in Confederacy again&s;t <HI>Spain</HI>; which is &s;uch a wild Di&s;proportion, that the Dan|ger cannot be thought &s;ufficient to any wi&s;e Man to make the lea&s;t Unea&s;ine&s;s in our Minds. On the other Hand, if the pre&s;ent <HI>Dauphin</HI> lives, and &s;hould have Children, as may very probably hap|pen, then the whole <HI>Chimera</HI> vani&s;hes at once, and the Renunciation may never come to take Place; or if it do, it may be &s;o many Ages hence, that no Man can &s;o much as &s;ugge&s;t what the Circum&s;tan|ces
<PB N="34" REF="39">
of that Time may be, or make any Provi&s;ion again&s;t it. Be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> then, that either of the&s;e Ca&s;es are the pre&s;ent State of <HI>Europe,</HI> as one of them mu&s;t be, what rational Doubt can any Man &s;tart in the pre|&s;ent Ca&s;e, why this is not a &s;ufficient Security to <HI>Europe,</HI> again&s;t the Fear of uniting the Kingdoms of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI>; &s;ince to argue again&s;t it mu&s;t be to argue again&s;t Human Nature? And &s;uppo&s;e the young Duke of <HI>Berry,</HI> who is a Prince of as much Fire as mo&s;t Men in <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;hould tamely and quietly give up his Claim to the Crown of <HI>France</HI>; and that too, after he is in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and quit it to his Brother, who has been expung'd by his own voluntary Act and Deed; and by a Formal Re|nunciation, which is made Legal, and accepted in all the mo&s;t effectual and &s;tronge&s;t Terms in the <HI>French</HI> Con&s;titution, and all this to be done by the &s;trong|e&s;t Prince to the weake&s;t by the Prince; who hath Power in his Hands to keep Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to that Prince, who hath no Power forcibly to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s him.</P>
<P>The&s;e are Ab&s;urdities nece&s;&s;ary only to a baffled Argument, and which none but the weake&s;t People in the World would lay any Weight upon, and &s;erve only to confirm any rea&s;onable Per&s;on in the Validity of this Renunciation, and in the Truth of what Her Maje&s;ty has laid down in the&s;e Three Heads.<LIST>
