<HEAD>TO Sir <HI>John Eyles,</HI> Bar. Member of Parliament for, and Alderman of the City of <HI>London,</HI> and Sub-Governor of the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF Tragick Poetry be, as Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> has &s;ome where &s;aid, the mo&s;t excellent and mo&s;t u&s;eful Kind of Writing, the more exten&s;ively u&s;eful the Moral of any Tragedy is, the more excellent that Piece mu&s;t be of its Kind.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3">I hope I &s;hall not be thought to in|&s;inuate that this, to which I have pre|&s;umed to prefix your Name, is &s;uch; that depends on its Fitne&s;s to an&s;wer the End of Tragedy, the exciting of the Pa&s;&s;ions, in order to the correcting &s;uch of them as are criminal, either in their Nature, or through their Exce&s;s. Whether the following Scenes do this in any tolerable Degree, is, with the Deference, that becomes one who wou'd not be thought vain, &s;ub|mitted to your candid and impartial Judgment.</P>
<P>What I wou'd infer is this, I think, evident Truth; that Tragedy is &s;o far from lo&s;ing its Dignity, by being ac|commodated to the Circum&s;tances of the Generality of Mankind, that it is more truly augu&s;t in Proportion to the Ex|tent of its Influence, and the Numbers that are properly affected by it. As it is more truly great to be the In&s;tru|ment of Good to many, who &s;tand in need of our A&s;&s;i&s;tance, than to a very &s;mall Part of that Number.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4">If Princes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were alone liable to Misfortunes, ari&s;ing from Vice, or Weakne&s;s in them&s;elves, or others, there wou'd be good Rea&s;on for confining the Characters in Tragedy to tho&s;e of &s;uperior Rank; but, &s;ince the contrary is evident, nothing can be more rea|&s;onable than to proportion the Remedy to the Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>I am far from denying that Trage|dies, founded on any in&s;tructive and extraordinary Events in Hi&s;tory, or a well-invented Fable, where the Per&s;ons introduced are of the highe&s;t Rank, are without their U&s;e, even to the Bulk of the Audience. The &s;trong Contra&s;t between a <HI>Tamerlane</HI> and a <HI>Bajazet,</HI> may have its Weight with an un&s;teady People, and contribute to the fixing of them in the Intere&s;t of a Prince of the Character of the former, when, thro' their own Levity, or the Arts of de&s;ign|ing Men, they are render'd factious and unea&s;y, tho' they have the highe&s;t Rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied. The Sentiments and Example of a <HI>Cato,</HI> may in&s;pire his Spectators with a ju&s;t Sen&s;e of the Value
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
of Liberty, when they &s;ee that hone&s;t Patriot prefer Death to an Obligation from a Tyrant, who wou'd &s;acrifice the Con&s;titution of his Country, and the Liberties of Mankind, to his Ambition or Revenge. I have attempted, indeed, to enlarge the Province of the graver Kind of Poetry, and &s;hould be glad to &s;ee it carried on by &s;ome abler Hand. Plays, founded on moral Tales in pri|vate Life, may be of admirable U&s;e, by carrying Conviction to the Mind, with &s;uch irre&s;i&s;table Force, as to en|gage all the Faculties and Powers of the Soul in the Cau&s;e of Virtue, by &s;tifling Vice in its fir&s;t Principles. They who imagine this to be too much to be attributed to Tragedy, mu&s;t be Stran|gers to the Energy of that noble Spe|cies of Poetry. <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> who has given &s;uch amazing Proofs of his Ge|nius, in that as well as in Comedy, in his <HI>Hamlet,</HI> has the following Lines.<Q><PB N="vii" REF="6">
<L><HI>Had he the Motive and the Cau&s;e for Pa&s;&s;ion</HI></L>
<L><HI>That I have; he wou'd drown the Stage with Tears</HI></L>
<L><HI>And cleave the general Ear with horrid Speech;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Make mad the Guilty, and appale the Free,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Confound the Ignorant, and amaze indeed</HI></L>
<L><HI>The very Faculty of Eyes and Ears.</HI></L></Q> And farther, in the &s;ame Speech,
<Q><L><HI>I've heard that guilty Creatures at a Play,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Have, by the very cunning of the Scene,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Been &s;o &s;truck to the Soul, that pre&s;ently</HI></L>
<L><HI>They have proclaim'd their Malefactions.</HI></L></Q>
Prodigious! yet &s;trictly ju&s;t. But I &s;han't take up your valuable Time with my Remarks; only give me Leave ju&s;t to ob&s;erve, that he &s;eems &s;o firmly per|&s;waded of the Power of a well wrote Piece to produce the Effect here a&s;cri|bed to it, as to make <HI>Hamlet</HI> venture his Soul on the Event, and rather tru&s;t that, than a Me&s;&s;enger from the other World, tho' it a&s;&s;umed, as he expre&s;&s;es it, his noble Father's Form, and a&s;|&s;ured him, that it was his Spirit. I'll have, &s;ays <HI>Hamlet,</HI> Grounds more relative.
<Q><PB N="viii" REF="7">
<L><HI>&mdash;The Play's the Thing,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Wherein I'll catch the Con&s;cience of the King.</HI></L></Q>
Such Plays are the be&s;t An&s;wers to them who deny the Lawfulne&s;s of the Stage.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering the Novelty of this At|tempt, I thought it would be expected from me to &s;ay &s;omething in its Ex|cu&s;e; and I was unwilling to lo&s;e the Opportunity of &s;aying &s;omething of the U&s;efulne&s;s of Tragedy in general, and what may be rea&s;onably expected from the farther Improvement of this excellent Kind of Poetry.</P>
<P>Sir, I hope you will not think I have &s;aid too much of an Art, a mean Specimen of which I am ambitious enough to recommend to your Favour and Protection. A Mind, con&s;cious of &s;uperior Worth, as much de&s;pi&s;es Flat|tery, as it is above it. Had I found in my &s;elf an Inclination to &s;o contemptible a Vice, I &s;hould not have cho&s;e Sir JOHN EYLES for my Patron. And indeed the be&s;t writ Panegyrick, tho'
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
&s;trictly true, mu&s;t place you in a Light, much inferior to that in which you have long been fix'd, by the Love and E&s;teem of your Fellow Citizens; who&s;e Choice of you for one of their Repre&s;entatives in Parliament, has &s;ufficiently declared their Sen&s;e of your Merit. Nor hath the Knowledge of your Worth been con|fined to the City. The Proprietors in the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company, in which are included Numbers of Per&s;ons; as con&s;iderable for their Rank, Fortune, and Under&s;tanding, as any in the Kingdom, gave the greate&s;t Proof of their Confidence, in your Capacity and Probity, when they cho&s;e you Sub-Governor of their Company, at a Time when their Affairs were in the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion, and their Properties in the greate&s;t Danger. Nor is the Court in&s;en&s;ible of your Importance. I &s;hall not therefore attempt your Character, nor pretend to add any Thing to a Reputation &s;o well e&s;ta|bli&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="9">Whatever others may think of a Dedication, wherein there is &s;o much &s;aid of other Things, and &s;o little of the Per&s;on to whom it is addre&s;s'd, I have Rea&s;on to believe that you will the more ea&s;ily pardon it on that very Account.</P>

<P>It was mournful indeed. <HI>Barnwell</HI>'s Youth and mode&s;t Deportment, as he pa&s;t, drew Tears from every Eye: When placed at the Bar, and ar|raigned before the Reverend Judges, with many Tears and interrupting Sobs he confe&s;s'd and ag|gravated his Offences, without accu&s;ing, or once re|flecting on <HI>Millwood,</HI> the &s;hamele&s;s Author of his Ruin; who dauntle&s;s and unconcern'd &s;tood by his Side, viewing with vi&s;ible Pride and Contempt the va&s;t A&s;&s;embly, who all with &s;ympathizing Sorrow wept for the wretched Youth. <HI>Millwood</HI> when call|ed upon to an&s;wer, loudly in&s;i&s;ted upon her Inno|cence, and made an artful and a bold Defence; but finding all in vain, the impartial Jury and the learn|ed Bench concurring to find her guilty, how did &s;he cur&s;e her &s;elf, poor <HI>Barnwell,</HI> us, her Judges, all
