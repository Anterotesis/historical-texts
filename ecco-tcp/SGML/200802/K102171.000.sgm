<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the misfortune of all <HI>great</HI> writers, to put pen to paper &s;o fa&s;t, and let their imaginations carry them away in &s;uch a hurry, that they &s;eldom con&s;ider whether their readers comprehen&s;ions will be able to gallop af|ter them po&s;t-ha&s;te, without being out of breath, to the end of the fir&s;t chapter, even tho' it &s;hould not contain above a
<PB N="4" REF="3">
dozen lines. And it is as great an er|ror in judgment, &mdash; nay, wor&s;e than that which <HI>Byng</HI> was &s;hot for, to put too much wit in any production that is in|tended for univer&s;al reading &mdash; I &s;ay, univer&s;al reading: for, be&s;ides the opi|nion of one of the greate&s;t writers of this or the la&s;t age, I cannot &s;ay which, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that a reader &s;hould have as much wit as the author he reads, to under|&s;tand him;"</Q>&mdash;which I flatter my&s;elf is &s;eldom the ca&s;e. I &s;peak as an author, and therefore &s;hould be allowed a little va|nity: I &s;ay, be&s;ides this generally received doctrine, how can we tell what different kinds of wit prevail with all the readers in the univer&s;e; &mdash; to go no further than the antipodes, it is a thou&s;and to one, whether they would under&s;tand a <HI>pun,</HI> or the be&s;t <HI>bon-mot</HI> in all <HI>Tri&s;tram Shandy</HI>: &mdash; and for aught I can tell, in
<PB N="5" REF="4">
the moon, and &s;ome other of the illite|rate planets, they may have exploded every kind of true wit mentioned by Addi&s;on. It is evidently for this rea&s;on, that in mo&s;t of the periodical works, which are reckoned <HI>univer&s;al,</HI> and parti|cularly the magazines, we are very &s;el|dom troubled with any thing but plain good &s;en&s;e, the be&s;t method of making water-gruel, and fattening of capons; which may be of u&s;e, and under&s;tood all over the world.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>MY good friend, and arch compa|nion Mr. <HI>Tri&s;tram Shandy, gentle|men,</HI> who makes &s;uch honourable men|tion of my learned father, the celebrated doctor <HI>Kuna&s;trokius,</HI> of phy&s;ical me|mory
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide pag. 23, vol. I.</NOTE> has fallen into this very mi&s;take that I have ju&s;t been mentioning; and, by a certain &s;ubtility of thinking, and quaint|ne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, the beauties and ex|cellencies of his work, may not only be pa&s;&s;ed over by many of the inhabitants of <HI>A&s;ia-minor, Monomotapa,</HI> &s;ome of the Mickmacs, Cherokees, and Catawbas, but, at lea&s;t, by &s;even hundred and fifty of the inhabitants of <HI>London,</HI> and <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter,</HI> the <HI>Borough of Southwark,</HI> and parts adjacent.</P>
<P>This computation, which I did not make my&s;elf, may appear at fir&s;t, &s;ome|what too exact, but the reader may be per&s;uaded I have it from the be&s;t autho|rity, &mdash;<HI>my printer,</HI> who a&s;&s;ures me, I can|not &s;ell more or le&s;s than that num|ber:
<PB N="7" REF="6">
I own I was at fir&s;t of another opinion, and therefore ordered him to print twenty thou&s;and; but he &s;oon con|vinced me of my mi&s;take, by the cart|loads of wa&s;te-paper in his &s;hop, &s;o that I now &s;et down to write for the &s;even hundred and fifty <HI>incomprehen&s;ible readers</HI> of <HI>Tri&s;tram Shandy,</HI> in and about the pur|licus of this metropolis, &mdash; and <HI>no other.</HI></P>

<P>TO them be it known, then, that Mr. <HI>Tri&s;tram Shandy</HI> is one of the greate&s;t morali&s;ts, and mo&s;t refined poli|ticians this, or any other age whatever has produced.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we enter upon the illu&s;|tration of the&s;e <HI>round a&s;&s;ertions,</HI> it will be nece&s;&s;ary to point out the qualifi|cations of a morali&s;t. He &s;hould have a fundamental knowledge of <HI>ethics,</HI> or that &s;cience which fixes the oeconomy and conduct of human Life, that teaches the regulation of the pa&s;&s;ions, and in|&s;tructs men to be happy, by practi&s;ing all the &s;ocial virtues. He &s;hould know how to adapt the&s;e rules to the various &s;ubjects he treats of, and point out &s;uch evident and uncontrovertable conclu&s;ions in favour of morality, as every unbia&s;&s;ed reader mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of the effect.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="9" REF="8">
<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P>A Morali&s;t has generally one, two, three, four, five, &s;ix, and &s;ome|times more things in view. Tho&s;e of the &s;ingular number, write for writing's &s;ake: tho&s;e of the fir&s;t plural number, invert the rule of oeconomy, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a penny &s;aved is a penny got,"</Q> and think, that in getting a penny, they do more than &s;ave one they have not, &mdash; &s;o that they make writing and eating go hand in hand. The triple number have gene|rally &s;ome new moral doctrine to broach, and, with the two former con-commit|tants, add, that of &s;elf-opiniated public &s;ervice. Then come the controverti&s;ts to the&s;e, and the recontroverti&s;ts, with
<PB N="10" REF="9">
their an&s;wers, replies, and rejoinders, <HI>ad infinitum.</HI> &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But, before I launch out any further in the definition of a moral writer, I mu&s;t inform my <HI>&s;even hundred and fifty readers</HI> that Mr. <HI>Tri&s;tram Shandy</HI> is not among any of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es. &mdash; He &s;tands by him&s;elf upon the top &s;helf of ethics, &mdash; tho' but <HI>in twelves, &mdash;unrivalled, &mdash; inimitable,</HI> &mdash; and (to my &s;even hun|dred and fifty incomprehen&s;ible readers) <HI>incomprehen&s;ible.</HI> He mu&s;t, therefore, be more fully explained than any of the foregoing morali&s;ts, &mdash; and, for that rea|&s;on, I allow him be&s;t part of the follow|ing &s;heets for his public defence to <HI>the moral world.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t evident mark of Mr. <HI>Tri&s;tram</HI>'s morals (which indeed
<PB N="11" REF="10">
is no farther than the third page) is what he puts into his mother's mouth upon his father's <HI>regularity</HI> in winding up the hou&s;e clock. <HI>Regularity</HI> every one knows is the corner-&s;tone of virtue&mdash;and virtue is the foundation of morality&mdash; Thus far, then, Mr. <HI>Shandy</HI> goes on in a moral track to give us the hi&s;tory of his anti-birth.</P>
<P>But what does the winding up of the clock allude to&mdash;and how comes it this thought always entered his mother's head once a month? This he very natu|rally accounts for by an a&s;&s;emblage of ideas, according to Locke; and what|ever it may want in <HI>decency,</HI> he very no|tably makes up by &s;ound philo&s;ophy and his <HI>little men</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Homunculus <HI>&s;ingular,</HI> Homunculi <HI>plural.</HI></NOTE> in embrio&mdash;according
<PB N="12" REF="11">
to the oeconomy of human life, and con&s;i&s;tant with moral duties.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<P>IT would be difficult for me, and te|dious for my readers, to trace Mr. <HI>Tri&s;tram Shandy</HI> through every part of his moral character: I &s;hall therefore con|fine my&s;elf to &s;uch traits as are the mo&s;t &s;triking (tho' not &s;elf-evident) and lea&s;t under&s;tood.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e the following pa&s;&s;age &s;eems next to claim our attention. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The rituals direct the baptizing of the child, in ca&s;e of danger, before it is born; but upon this provi&s;o, that &s;ome part or other of the child's body be &s;een by the bapti&s;er: but the
<PB N="13" REF="12">
doctors of the Sorbonne, by delibera|tion, held among&s;t them April 10, 1733, have enlarged the powers of the midwives, by determining, that though no part of the child's body &s;hould appear, &mdash; that bapti&s;m &s;hall neverthele&s;s be admini&s;tered to it by injection by means of a little &s;quirt. 'Tis very &s;trange that St. Thomas Aquinas, who had &s;o good a mecha|nical head, both for tying and untying, the knots of &s;chool-divinity, &s;hould, after &s;o much pains be&s;towed upon this&mdash;give up the point at la&s;t, as a thing impo&s;&s;ible."</Q></P>
<P>Here follows the que&s;tion upon bap|ti&s;m, with the con&s;ultation of the doctors of the Sorbonne thereupon in French; but as Mr. <HI>Shandy</HI> has not favoured us with a tran&s;lation, and as very likely
<PB N="14" REF="13">
&s;ome of my <HI>incomprehen&s;ible</HI> readers may not under&s;tand that language, I have ren|dered it in Engli&s;h.&mdash;Tho&s;e of my rea|ders, who (notwith&s;tanding their <HI>incom|prehen&s;ibility</HI>) have a &s;mattering of the Gallican tongue, and fancy they com|prehend the whole affair in the original, have nothing to do but &s;kip to chapter 9, and fancy there is no &s;uch thing as chapter 8 in this <HI>whole</HI> book,&mdash;I mean <HI>volume.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>A Memorial pre&s;ented to the doctors of the Sorbonne. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A Sur|geon and man-midwife repre&s;ents to the gentlemen of the <HI>Sorbonne,</HI> that there are &s;ome ca&s;es, though very un|common, wherein a mother cannot
<PB N="15" REF="14">
be delivered, and when even the child is &s;o inclo&s;ed in the mother's womb, that no part of it's body appears, in which ca&s;e, according to the rituals, bapti&s;m &s;hould be conferred to it, at lea&s;t, upon conditions. The &s;urgeon, who makes this repre&s;entation, en|gages, by means of a &s;yringe, to baptize immediately the child, with|out any way hurting the mother. The que&s;tion he a&s;ks is, whether this method he propo&s;es, is allowable and legal, and if he may follow it in a ca&s;e parallel to that which he repre|&s;ents?"</Q></P>
<P>The an&s;wer to the foregoing memo|rial:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The council is of opinion, that the que&s;tion propo&s;ed has many difficulties
<PB N="16" REF="15">
to be fir&s;t removed. The theologi&s;ts have on one &s;ide e&s;tabli&s;hed a princi|ple, that bapti&s;m, which is a &s;piritual birth, &s;uppo&s;es a prior birth; we mu&s;t be born into the world to be re|born in <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> according to their doctrine. St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> part. 3. quae&s;t. 88. article 11. follows this opinion as an e&s;tabli&s;hed fact: we cannot (&s;ays that holy doctor) baptize children which are inclo&s;ed in their mothers wombs. By this St. Thomas means the&s;e children are not born, and there|fore cannot be reckoned among&s;t o|ther men: from whence he infers they cannot be the object of an exter|nal action, to receive thereby the &s;a|craments nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation: Pu|eri in maternis uteris exi&s;tentes non|dum prodicerunt in lucem ut cum aliis hominibus vitam ducant, unde
<PB N="17" REF="16">
non po&s;&s;unt &s;ubjici actioni humanae, ut per corum mini&s;terum &s;acramenta recipiant ad &s;alutem. The rituals enforce the practice of what theoli|gi&s;ts have regulated upon tho&s;e heads and they unanimou&s;ly prohibit the bap|ti&s;ing of children which are inclo&s;ed in their mothers wombs, if no part of their bodies appears. The concur|rence of the theologi&s;ts and the ri|tuals, which are the rules of the dio|ce&s;&s;es, &s;eems to e&s;tabli&s;h an authority nece&s;&s;ary to an&s;wer the pre&s;ent que&s;|&s;tion: however, the council of con|&s;cience, con&s;idering on the one hand, that the rea&s;onings of the theologi&s;ts is entirely founded upon their de&s;ire of conformity, and that the prohibi|tion of the rituals, &s;uppo&s;es, that chil|dren &s;o inclo&s;ed, cannot be baptized in their mothers wombs, which is again&s;t the pre&s;ent &s;uppo&s;ition; and,
<PB N="18" REF="17">
on the other hand, con&s;idering that the &s;ame theologians teach, that the Sacraments which <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> has e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, as the ea&s;y, but nece&s;&s;ary means of &s;anctifying man, may be hazarded; and be&s;ides, &s;uppo&s;ing that children inclo&s;ed in their mothers wombs are capable of &s;alvation, as they are liable to damnation; upon the&s;e con&s;iderations, and having an eye to the memorial, wherein it is a&s;|&s;ured, that a certain method is found out, of baptizing children thus in|clo&s;ed, without occa&s;ioning the lea&s;t prejudice to the mother; the council imagines, that the means propo&s;ed may be made u&s;e of, in the belief that God has not left this kind of children without any re&s;ource, and &s;uppo&s;ing, according to the repre&s;en|tation, that the means there propo&s;ed are porper to procure them bapti&s;m,
<PB N="19" REF="18">
neverthele&s;s, as by authorizing the propo&s;ed practice, a rule univer&s;ally e&s;tabli&s;hed mu&s;t be cancelled, the council thinks, that the memorali&s;t &s;hould make application to his bi&s;hop, who&s;e province it is to judge of the utility and danger of the method pro|po&s;ed, and as (under the direction of the bi&s;hop) the council thinks that re|cour&s;e &s;hould be had to the pope, in whom the right of explaining the laws of the church, and of derogating therefrom, where they cannot be ex|ecuted, is inve&s;ted: and, however in|genious and u&s;eful the manner of bap|ti&s;m here propo&s;ed may be, the council cannot give their approbation to it, without the concurrence of the&s;e two authorities. The memorali&s;t is, at lea&s;t, advi&s;ed to apply to his bi&s;hop, and to inform him of the pre&s;ent de|ci&s;ion, that in ca&s;e the prelate &s;hould
<PB N="20" REF="19">
coincide with the rea&s;ons, whereupon the under-&s;igned have founded their opinions, he may be authorized in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity, when too much time may be lo&s;t to a&s;k permi&s;&s;ion, and have it granted, for following the method propo&s;ed, &s;o advantageous to the child's &s;alvation. The council has nothing further to add, than, that notwith&s;tanding they believe this me|thod may be pur&s;ued, are neverthe|le&s;s of opinion, that in ca&s;e the chil|dren in que&s;tion &s;hould come into the world, contrary to the expectation of tho&s;e who have u&s;ed this method, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to baptize them upon condition; and this is conform|able to all the rituals, which in autho|rizing the bapti&s;m of a child, &s;ome part of who&s;e body appears, enjoins at the &s;ame time, and orders it's bapti&s;m

<P><PB N="56" REF="55">But to wave all con&s;iderations of this nature, my readers, as incomprehen&s;ible as they are, mu&s;t have perceived e'er now, that <HI>Tri&s;tram Shandy</HI> is the mo&s;t <HI>ex|cellent</HI> (I was going to &s;ay &mdash; <HI>e&s;t,</HI> by way of a <HI>&s;uperlative &s;uperlative,</HI> &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion) piece that has appeared for many years; be&s;ides, according to <HI>Hu|bras,</HI>&mdash;&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash; The worth of every thing, Is ju&s;t as much as it will bring, &mdash; and this is the deare&s;t production to the book&s;eller, if <HI>not</HI> to the public, that has appeared for near half a centry.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT. TO THE NOBILITY and GENTRY OF ALL EUROPE.</HEAD>
<P>AS I expect, in con&s;equence of the foregonig work, to receive invita|tions on every hand for parties of plea|&s;ure, regales, dinners, and &s;uppers &mdash; in order to prevent confu&s;ion in my engage|ments, and that I may not make ap|pointments with per&s;ons I am intirely ignorant of, I beg they would, with all convenient di&s;patch, &s;end their titles,
<PB N="58" REF="57">
names, and places of abode, with cards to my book&s;eller's, that I may pay com|pliments to them, according to their dif|ferent ranks; or, where upon a footing, according to their alphabetical &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> Such noblemen, &amp;c. as chu&s;e to give me te&s;timony of their approba|tion of this book, by particular marks of their beneficence, will plea&s;e to take notice, that no <HI>living,</HI> however lucrative, can be accepted, as I am not in orders.</P>
<P>&rindx; I am particularly obliged to the managers of both the hou&s;es, who&s;e kind intentions I already anticipate, in favouring me with the freedom of their re&s;pective theatres, and they may de|pend upon my paying my compliments
<PB N="59" REF="58">
to them in due time; &mdash; but I am afraid I cannot accept of Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; 's kind invitation to his hou&s;e at <HI>Hampton</HI> this &s;ummer.</P>
