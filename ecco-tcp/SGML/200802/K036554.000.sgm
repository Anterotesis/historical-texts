<HEAD>TO ELIZABETH, COUNTESS OF MOIRA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE attention you have vouch&s;afed to the Counte&s;s of Sali&s;bury and the Author, ever &s;ince they have had the honour of being known to your Lady&s;hip, per&s;uades me that you will take plea&s;ure in hearing it has been favourably received on the Engli&s;h Theatre. Stript now of all &s;tage decoration, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which it has hitherto received from the mo&s;t animated performance, it is to undergo a &s;tricter &s;crutiny, that of the clo&s;et; a &s;crutiny for which it is indeed but little provided. I know your Lady&s;hip will make a tender allowance for want of experience in the Author, and &s;uch errors as are incident to human inperfection; but this is an indulgence, which I doubt the critic will not &s;o readily &s;hew him. But however he may cen&s;ure, I mu&s;t ever think my&s;elf happy in having already acquired your Lady&s;hip's good opinions. I am al&s;o flattered, as often as I think of the near re&s;emblance my Heroine has of your Lady&s;hip. Had I been earlier honoured with your Lady&s;hip's acquain|tance, I think I could have much enlarged the

character. And yet there are many virtues, many delicacies, which it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for me to have pre&s;erved in the picture, of which tho&s;e only can be truly &s;en&s;ible, who have the happine&s;s of being acquainted with the Original.</P>
<P>Plea&s;e, Madam, to accept the following attempt, as an offering of my gratitude for many favours; an imperfect indeed, but hone&s;t proof, of the e&s;teem, which is due from,</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE COUNTESS OF SALISBURY made her appearance about two years ago in Ireland, where &s;he was received with very &s;ingular marks of favour; the Author there had many friends, and with all the partiality they might be &s;uppo&s;ed to have for him, tho&s;e friends did not he&s;itate to declare, that the excellent performance of Mrs. Dancer and Mr. Barry, contributed largely to the &s;ucce&s;s of the Piece: written in his early youth, without having much know|ledge of the &s;tage, or dramatic performances, the Author is &s;en&s;ible what his Tragedy mu&s;t be, notwith&s;tanding the &s;miles with which it has been indulged. England, agree|able to the character of good nature and gene|ro&s;ity which it has e&s;tabli&s;hed through all the world, has kindly followed the example of its &s;i&s;ter nation, and received with an indul|gence the attempt of a young Writer, who is indeed ambitious of plea&s;ing, but dare not a&s;pire to excellence. He attributes, in great mea&s;ure, his good fortune now, to what his friends attributed it before, the animated performance of Mrs. Dancer and Mr. Barry: it is theirs to endeavour to &s;upport a reputation already gained, his to aim at improvement, in order to acquire one.</P>

<L>MY jewels, I'm come to &s;pake in the behalf&mdash;</L>

<L>Smit with the love of glory and of pelf,</L>

<L>Or all the &s;cenes each fooli&s;h poet paints&mdash;</L>
<L>O bub bub-boo! give me the I&s;le of Saints.</L>
<L>Turn up your no&s;es, cavil now and carp&mdash;</L>
