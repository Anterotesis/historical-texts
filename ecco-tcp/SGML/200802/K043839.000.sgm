<P>THIS Piece was performed la&s;t Sum|mer at RANELAGH; but, though very much approved by the be&s;t Judges of Mu&s;ical Compo&s;ition, by being performed in an Orche&s;tra, lo&s;t the better Part of its Effect.</P>
<P>It was thought it would plea&s;e more in Action upon the Theatre; and with the Addition of a new Scene and Chorus, and a <HI>Ballet</HI> &s;uitable to the Subject; is now, accordingly, once more pre&s;ented to the Public, with the nece&s;&s;ary Advantages of Dre&s;&s;es and Decorations.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">The Mu&s;ic is compo&s;ed by Mr. DIBDIN, who has already had the Honour to be particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Public, for his Songs in the PADLOCK, and the JUBILEE: it is pre&s;umed, he has been at lea&s;t as happy in this, as in any of his former Compo&s;itions. As to the Words, being calculated merely for the U&s;e of the Compo&s;er, the Author hopes, in that Light only they will be con&s;idered.</P>
