<HEAD>A LETTER To the RIGHT REVEREND The Lord Bi&s;hop of O----d.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A LETTER, &s;ub&s;cribed by a <HI>late Profe&s;&s;or in the Univer&s;ity of Oxford,</HI> and addre&s;&s;ed to a learned Prelate now living, fell into my hands no earlier than a few days ago. A very unexpected cha|racter, which is therein given of the li|terary ta&s;te and genius of the late Dr. <HI>Bentley,</HI> has &s;trongly tempted me to ad|dre&s;s a few ob&s;ervations to the Writer of that Letter; and as I &s;hall hope to do this
<PB N="6" REF="4">
with all becoming civility and decorum I pre&s;ume the <HI>Lord Bi&s;hop of O-----</HI> will make no &s;cruple to avow any opi|nions, which a <HI>late Profe&s;&s;or in that Uni|ver&s;ity</HI> thought fit to advance.</P>
<P>In the corre&s;pondence I have now commenced with your Lord&s;hip, it is far from my meaning to attempt at mea|&s;uring weapons with you in the &s;cience of letters; I have much too humble a &s;en&s;e of my own powers, and too high a re&s;pect for your Lord&s;hip's, to entertain &s;uch a de&s;ign. It is an appeal to your candour as a gentleman, not an attack upon your capacity as a &s;cholar, that I meditate. I am willing you &s;hould enjoy, whole and unenvied, all the &s;ame you can fairly and hone&s;tly acquire; but I would wi&s;h your Lord&s;hip to believe that no credit is to be gained, either with the pre&s;ent age or po&s;terity, by attempt|ing
<PB N="7" REF="5">
to demoli&s;h the reputation of an|other.</P>
<P>Add to this, that &s;uch conduct is, in your particular, gro&s;sly impolitic. You at pre&s;ent enjoy a temporary repo&s;e; ho&s;ti|lities &s;eem for a while &s;u&s;pended between your <HI>Right Reverend Corre&s;pondent</HI> and you; cultivate the time; examine and improve your re&s;ources; conciliate to your&s;elf new allies, rivet and confirm your old ones; and imitate tho&s;e few wi&s;e and provident princes, who, know|ing the &s;hort duration of all public fe|licity, employ the intervals of peace in preparations for a future war.</P>
<P>You will probably find employment enough for all your talents, when the great champion, whom you have &s;o in|&s;ultingly provoked, &s;hall enter the li&s;ts again&s;t you; the time will certainly come;
<PB N="8" REF="6">
and among&s;t the virtues, which you will have occa&s;ion to exerci&s;e in that day of trial, 'tis well, my Lord, if repentance be not found to have a place.</P>
<P>The zealous affection, which you, my Lord, &s;o well know how to expre&s;s for your friends, mu&s;t excu&s;e the warmth with which I intere&s;t my&s;elf in the de|fence of mine. If honour calls upon us to re&s;ent an a&s;per&s;ion upon an ab&s;ent friend, yet living; &s;omething more than honour, piety engages us to vindicate the dead. Did your Lord&s;hip, when you &s;truck with &s;uch rancour at Dr. <HI>Bentley,</HI> flatter your&s;elf that he had out|lived all tho&s;e private and tender alliances, which bind and connect mankind to|gether, and that his fame lay at the mercy of every free booter? Far from it; the learned and the candid of all na|tions are the friends of his fame; and no
<PB N="9" REF="7">
incon&s;iderable number &s;till &s;urvive, whom his private worth and virtues have left under la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions of affection. The former order of men will probably think you have di&s;covered no great tokens of di&s;cernment in this invective; or, fa|vouring your judgment, will think your temper not altogether free from &s;ome &s;mall portion of envy and a&s;perity. As for the latter cla&s;s of people, per&s;onalities, my Lord, inflame mankind to that de|gree, that 'tis well if they leave you even the &s;mall &s;hred of reputation, which you have allowed to Dr. <HI>Bentley.</HI></P>
<P>Recollect, my Lord, the warmth, the piety, with which you remon&s;trated a|gain&s;t <HI>Bi&s;hop W----</HI>'s treatment of your father in a pa&s;&s;age of his <HI>Julian</HI>: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 128.</NOTE>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>It is not in behalf of my&s;elf that I expo&s;tulate; but of one, for whom I am much more concerned, that is &mdash; my Father.</HI>"</Q>
<PB N="10" REF="8">
The&s;e are your Lord&s;hip's words; amiable, affecting expre&s;&s;ion! in&s;tructive le&s;&s;on of filial devotion! Alas, my Lord, that you, who was thus &s;en&s;ible to the lea&s;t &s;peck, which fell upon the reputation of your father, &s;hould be &s;o inveterate again&s;t the fame of one, at lea&s;t as eminent, and perhaps no le&s;s dear to his family.</P>
<P>For my own part, much as I reverence great and learned men, in my poor e&s;ti|mation, one generous &s;entiment, one be|nevolent emanation of the heart, is of more value and re&s;pect than all the un|impa&s;&s;ioned productions of the under|&s;tanding; I therefore cannot help hold|ing <HI>your Corre&s;pondent</HI> in higher e&s;teem for the generous and candid manner in which he atones for this offence, than for all the va&s;t fund of erudition, which he has di&s;played in the eyes of the world, to the &s;ingular annoyance (as it &s;hould &s;eem) of your Lord&s;hip, but to the ge|neral
<PB N="11" REF="9">
u&s;e and information of all man|kind be&s;ides.</P>
<P>He tells you, that he knew not that the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pages 132, 133.</NOTE> Mr. L. whom he had treated with di&s;re&s;pect in one of his notes, was your father; that this circum&s;tance amply ju&s;tified you for every thing he com|plained of relative to your unkind u&s;age of him in your prelections; in &s;hort, that he owed &s;o much to your piety, which he con&s;idered as really edifying, that he would &s;trike out that note a|gain&s;t your father the fir&s;t opportunity. Indeed, the whole turn of the letter, from which the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions are &s;elected, carries &s;uch an air of candour and polite acknowledgment, that I am &s;urpri&s;ed your Lord&s;hip, with this tran&s;action fre&s;h in your memory, &s;hould not have con|&s;idered, when you was thus unhand|&s;omely
<PB N="12" REF="10">
treating Dr. <HI>Bentley</HI>'s character, that it was po&s;&s;ible &s;ome one might be found, under the &s;ame predicament, or with the &s;ame feelings towards him, that you had experienced towards Mr. L. There is a rule, my Lord, in the Chri&s;tian doctrine, which I dare &s;ay you have frequently recommended to other people, that on this occa&s;ion would have been peculiarly u&s;eful to your&s;elf. All that can now be done is, that, as you have thought fit to copy <HI>your learned Corre&s;pondent</HI> in the lea&s;t amiable part of his character, you &s;hould &s;trive to re|&s;emble him in his more &s;hining fea|tures; and learn of him, that even faults may be made graceful by an in|genuous manner of atoning for them. As there are &s;ome di&s;tempers, which, by being &s;kilfully cured, leave the con|&s;titution more vigorous and healthy, than if it had never been attacked by them;
<PB N="13" REF="11">
&s;o there &s;eem to be certain flaws in the moral conduct of &s;ome men, which, being well and effectually repaired, &s;et off the character with greater lu&s;tre and advantage than it could have appeared with, had &s;uch imperfections never been di&s;covered. Was I worthy to pre&s;cribe to your Lord&s;hip, the ta&s;k would be no very hard one that I &s;hould &s;et you; it would be only to give your real &s;en|timents of Dr. <HI>Bentley</HI>'s merit; and I am per&s;uaded they would turn out the mo&s;t complete recantation of what you have now been plea&s;ed to amu&s;e us with, that could be wi&s;hed for.</P>
<P>I have entered thus circum&s;tantially into this matter, not with a de&s;ign to aggravate your Lord&s;hip's offence, but to extenuate my own. Cen&s;ure which falls from you, my Lord, falls from a great height; e&s;pecially when the de|fencele&s;s
<PB N="14" REF="12">
object, upon whom it is di|rected, is unhappily laid &s;o low.</P>
<P>You will now permit me to tran&s;cribe the &s;entence of which I complain. I find it in your 80th page; I mention the page, becau&s;e for the allu&s;ion it bears to any part of your &s;ubject, it might as well be &s;ought for in any other leaf of the book. The paragraph is addre&s;&s;ed to <HI>Bi&s;hop W-----,</HI> and runs thus;&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And here more opportunely for the illu&s;tration of what I am &s;aying, than for your own purpo&s;e, you introduce <HI>the incomparable Bentley,</HI> as &s;tanding in the foremo&s;t rank of modern critics; of grammatical and verbal critics I agree with you; he could judge with great penetration of the age of an author by the dialect, the phra&s;e, and the matter; by The|riclean cups and Sicilian talents; this

was his proper &s;phere of &s;cience, and in this he excelled: but in matters of pure ta&s;te, a fine di&s;cernment of the different characters of compo&s;i|tion, colours of &s;tyle, and manners of thinking; of interior beauties and excellencies of writing, in regard to all this, what was he? <HI>Unus capri|mulgus, aut fo&s;&s;or.</HI> What then has he to do here?"</Q>
&mdash;Ay, what in|deed? Your Lord&s;hip has a&s;ked a que|&s;tion, which I really cannot ea&s;ily re|&s;olve; and, but that you have prevented me in it, the very que&s;tion I &s;hould have taken the liberty of putting to your Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>For what an&s;wer can we give? Is it to be thought that you conceive this &s;overeign contempt of Dr. <HI>Bentley</HI>'s ta&s;te and genius from an acquaintance with his works? with his <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is propo&s;ed to publi&s;h a new edition of the&s;e works in a &s;hort time.</NOTE> original works
<PB N="16" REF="14">
I mean; for, although a great and ele|gant genius will break forth, even when employed in the under work of cri|tici&s;m and expo&s;ition, (as witne&s;s your Lord&s;hip's learned labours on the He|brew poe&s;y), yet undoubtedly it is in compo&s;itions of an original &s;ort, where the proper e&s;timate of the genius of an author is to be formed. Let me then with all due re&s;pect demand of your Lord&s;hip, from which of the original productions of Dr. <HI>Bentley</HI>'s pen is it that you have collected the&s;e very un|favourable &s;entiments concerning him? In which of his labours have you tra|ced the brutal ignorance of a <HI>goatherd,</HI> the clowni&s;h &s;tupidity of a <HI>hedger and ditcher?</HI> Indeed, my good Lord, the&s;e are hard words; wor&s;e by one half than you be&s;towed upon the prophet <HI>Ezra,</HI> who e&s;caped your &s;atire with the appel|lation only of a <HI>&s;emi-barbarian.</HI> Could you have given wor&s;e language to a
<PB N="17" REF="15">
country curate at a vi&s;itation? Is your Lord&s;hip &s;ure that the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions are perfectly elegant and perfectly true? are they fit for one &s;cholar, one gentle|man, one Chri&s;tian divine to be&s;tow upon another? do they give us any impre&s;&s;ion of your Lord&s;hip's manners, of your wit, or of your judgment? The virtues of your heart, my Lord, and the purity of your morals, will &s;upport your character with the pre&s;ent age; but it mu&s;t be the productions of your un|der&s;tanding, that are to e&s;tabli&s;h your reputation with po&s;terity: How therefore could you think of tran&s;mitting to after-ages an opinion, which mankind will be &s;ure to charge to the error either of your head, or of your heart? What provo|cation can you have received from Dr. <HI>Bentley</HI>'s genius, that you &s;hould liken it to that of boors and pea&s;ants? I don't know, my Lord, what kind of licence you men of learning take in &s;peaking
<PB N="18" REF="16">
of each other; but we, who act in com|mon life, and have common under&s;tand|ings, &s;tare at &s;uch familiarities; a cer|tain cautious principle (which your Lord|&s;hip &s;eems to hold in di&s;regard) called prudence; and a &s;mall degree of worldly virtue (in which your Lord&s;hip, 'tis plain, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, does not abound) called good-manners, teach us to &s;mother and repre&s;s the&s;e &s;allies of &s;pleen and ill-nature; if not from natural principle, yet from the dread of that humiliating correction, which expre&s;&s;ions of &s;o of|fen&s;ive a nature would be apt to incur. The&s;e, my Lord, are among&s;t the checks and re&s;traints that civilize &s;ociety. I don't mean to apply them to the ca&s;e in que&s;tion; I believe, and, by your Lord|&s;hip's example, am convinced, that other rules and principles obtain in the re|public of letters; every thing there breathes an unre&s;trained freedom of man|ners; affronts are mutually interchanged,
<PB N="19" REF="17">
and challenges are publicly given and accepted by the grave&s;t and mo&s;t re&s;pect|able characters: nothing, however, &s;hall per&s;uade me that this is not ridiculous and unbecoming. I cannot &s;ee <HI>Profe&s;&s;ors,</HI> dignified Divines and <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> tilting at each other, without a blu&s;h: 'tis this unpardonable petulancy that makes the company of men of learning &s;o little &s;ought after; it reduces literary &s;cience to the rank of a mechanical art; when the &s;cholar is found to give way to as many little mean detracting in&s;inuations in his profe&s;&s;ion, as a <HI>Fidler,</HI> or a <HI>Taylor</HI> does in his. For my own part, &s;uch is my prejudice again&s;t envy and ill-nature, and &s;o great is the re&s;pect that I bear to candour and complai&s;ance, that, altho' I have your Lord&s;hip's example before my eyes, &s;till I cannot be per&s;uaded that invidious a&s;per&s;ions, le&s;&s;ening com|pari&s;ons, and calumnious railings, are any proofs of liberal education, or of an

low-bred dealings in clowns might find &s;ome excu&s;e; but when we &s;ee the &s;ame mean pa&s;&s;ions carried into upper life, and exhibited by a man of your Lord&s;hip's talents and erudition, we blu&s;h for you, for your profe&s;&s;ion, for your title; we feel an ingenuous &s;hame for the di&s;reputation, which is brought upon learning, nay, even upon our country; and we &s;igh when we can no longer e&s;teem a character like your Lord&s;hip's;&mdash;for &s;urely, my Lord, you forget how much you expo&s;e your own fame, when you endeavour to blind and to blacken that of Dr. <HI>Bentley</HI>'s.</P>
<P>The treatment the world has thought proper to be&s;tow upon critics in general, &s;uits its gratitude: it is owing to the labours of the eminent in that department, that almo&s;t any of the now elegant remains of Greek and Roman literature are at this day intelligible; the moment they were &s;o, the weapons they were &s;o kind to

<P>But I ju&s;t now de&s;ired your Lord&s;hip to re&s;olve me in which of Dr. <HI>Bentley</HI>'s original works it was, that you had di&s;|covered &s;uch convincing marks of the meanne&s;s and contemptible ru&s;ticity of his genius: was it in his declamations from the pulpit that he betrayed this utter ignorance of <HI>the beauties and excel|lencies of writing?</HI> Did ever <HI>Herd&s;man</HI> from his ob&s;ervations on nature, and the fabric and con&s;truction of man, argue up to the divine author and creator of all things with &s;uch &s;trength of rea&s;oning, &s;uch convictive eloquence, as are to be found in his <HI>Lectures?</HI> Did ever <HI>Hedger and Ditcher</HI> give &s;uch edifying, &s;uch &s;a|tisfactory <HI>Rea&s;ons for the Hope and the Faith that was in him,</HI> as are given in his famous <HI>Commencement Sermon?</HI> Many clowns, my Lord, it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd,

I flatter my&s;elf therefore I may conclude, that it is not in the pulpit your Lord&s;hip will arraign Dr. <HI>Bentley</HI>; it is not for his labours in the cau&s;e of religion, the in&s;truction of mankind, and the confutation of athei&s;m, that your Lord&s;hip (&s;o con&s;picuous for merits of the &s;ame nature) means to degrade and di&s;grace his memory.

I will venture to conclude that you have not taken up this contemptuous opinion of his under&s;tanding and abilities, from the &s;ervices he has done to religion, and the in&s;tructions he has bequeathed to man|kind.</P>
<P>But, my Lord, this is not all; I have &s;ome little matter more to offer in de|fence of his mangled reputation; &s;ome

few remarks more to make upon his &s;ervices in the cau&s;e of God and of re|ligion; I hope the&s;e will not be taken for tokens of his want of under&s;tanding. The confutation of athei&s;m &s;eems an ea&s;y and obvious ta&s;k, a work for real <HI>herd&s;men</HI> and <HI>hedgers</HI>; every object proves the exi&s;tence of the Deity, and every rational being comprehends that proof; but <HI>Bentley,</HI> like a hardy ob&s;tinate clown as he was, undertook a bolder ta&s;k; this ignorant, unpoli&s;hed pea&s;ant undertook, my Lord, to confute and expo&s;e the fine gentlemen of his age, the wits and rea|&s;oners of the time, the &s;et of <HI>Free-thinkers</HI> that unhinged the age in which he lived, and threw the whole bench of bi&s;hops (your Lord&s;hip was not then among&s;t the number) into con&s;ternation and di&s;may. In this dilemma, my Lord, when the whole army of Prote&s;tant Di|vines, mitred and unmitred, like that of <HI>Saul</HI> upon the challenge of <HI>Goliath,</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="26">
trembled behind their trenches, this de&s;|picable herd&s;man, this booby boor, taken like <HI>David</HI> from the &s;heep-folds, entered the li&s;ts, and &s;ingly overthrew the mighty champion of infidelity. The triumphs of Chri&s;tianity upon this victory were only to be equalled by the applau&s;es, which every true believer be&s;towed upon their defender: The whole bench of bi&s;hops honoured Dr. <HI>Bentley</HI> with their thanks: Behold the revolution of a few years! <HI>Bentley</HI> dies; your Lord&s;hip &s;ucceeds to a &s;eat on that bench; you di&s;&s;ent from your predece&s;&s;ors, and tear their trophies from his &s;hrine.</P>
<P>Let me &s;top here for a moment; I would fain pre&s;erve all po&s;&s;ible re&s;pect for your Lord&s;hip, and mu&s;t not there|fore pur&s;ue my thoughts where they would lead me on this &s;ubject. But really if men of your order, who are enli&s;ted and banded together again&s;t the

made &s;uch nice di&s;coveries in a language, of which there is now ex|tant but one volume, as not only to have been able to fix the date of this poem, (the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 80.</NOTE><HI>Homer</HI> of the Hebrew cla&s;&s;ics), but to have pointed out to po&s;terity the <HI>Au|gu&s;tan aera of Hebrew poe&s;y,</HI> though you readily allow there was <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 96.</NOTE><HI>very little va|riation in the language from the time of Mo&s;es to the Babyloni&s;h captivity.</HI></P>
<P>But to convince your Lord&s;hip with what reluctance I yield to any impre&s;&s;ions in disfavour of that <HI>candour and benevo|lence,</HI> which you a&s;&s;ure us are to be found in &s;uch plentiful portions in your compo&s;ition, I will confe&s;s that I am far from thinking we have as yet di&s;covered the cau&s;e that ruined Dr. <HI>Bentley</HI> in
<PB N="33" REF="31">
your good opinion: the laurels he won by his triumphs over athei&s;m and infi|delity, I am per&s;uaded, would neither have attracted your envy, nor incurred your ill-will. I dare believe your Lord|&s;hip is far too con&s;iderate in your re&s;ent|ments to abu&s;e any man, when there is no pro&s;pect of &s;erving your&s;elf by it, or gratifying your friends; but in the law|ful pro&s;ecution of one's fortune, when by making one enemy we can gain two patrons, your Lord&s;hip under&s;tands the value of the world's favour too well, and the road that leads to it, to he&s;itate a moment; and if Dr. <HI>Bentley</HI>'s fame has been one round in the ladder, by which your Lord&s;hip has climbed to the &s;um|mit of preferment,
<Q><L>&mdash; " <HI>Scelera ip&s;a nefa&s;que</HI></L>

<P>I think therefore we may venture to draw this conclu&s;ion, that, had this ob|ject of your contempt been ble&s;&s;ed with &s;uch faculties, as to have rea&s;oned all <HI>Athei&s;m</HI> and <HI>Dei&s;m</HI> effectually out of fa&s;hion, and put to perpetual &s;ilence every profe&s;&s;or of infidelity; had he taken the whole walk of critici&s;m to him&s;elf, and filled our &s;helves with notes, comments, and corrections upon every antient cla&s;|&s;ic that has come down to us; he might have done it with impunity, per|haps with applau&s;e, had he but &s;pared a certain club of wits, who &s;ucked the milk of &s;cience from the &s;ame brea&s;ts,
<PB N="35" REF="33">
at which it &s;eems your Lord&s;hip fed. With the&s;e confederates, your Lord&s;hip well knows, he &s;ingly maintained a no|table controver&s;y, with every advantage on his &s;ide, that &s;uperior talents for wit, learning and argumentation could give him. If your Lord&s;hip doubts which party triumphed in this di&s;pute, you are the only man of erudition in all Europe that does; but this I dare &s;ay is by no means the ca&s;e. You could have pitied him, but you cannot find in your heart to applaud him: facts pre&s;s &s;o hard upon you, that you have no argument, but the la&s;t refuge of a flat denial; and the &s;u|periority of his genius is &s;o very con&s;pi|cuous, that nothing now can be done, but by a re&s;olute and de&s;perate manoeuvre to a&s;&s;ail him in that quarter, where he is conceived to be lea&s;t vulnerable, and con|&s;equently lea&s;t expecting an attack. In &s;ome circum&s;tances every thing is to be

ri&s;ked; deny him therefore every faculty for which he was mo&s;t eminent; and though the very &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s, which gives your Lord&s;hip the inclination to abu&s;e him, furni&s;hes the ample&s;t refu|tation of that abu&s;e, be animated by the hazard of the attempt, and make, if po&s;&s;ible, the cradle of his reputation, the tomb of it. The difficulty of finding an an&s;wer to your Lord&s;hip's que&s;tion at the conclu&s;ion of your character of Dr. <HI>Bent|ley,</HI> now entirely vani&s;hes; and when, af|ter having be&s;towed every term that your fertile imagination, a&s;&s;i&s;ted be&s;ides by that of <HI>Catullus,</HI> could furni&s;h, mo&s;t contemp|tuous, you a&s;k&mdash;

for tho&s;e very qualifications, that you publicly declare him to be deficient in, we thankfully accept your reprehen&s;ions, as a te&s;timony of your private applau&s;e, which though it is not indeed &s;ignified in &s;o gracious a manner as it might be, yet we hold it of much value, from the certainty with which it directs us to the real &s;entiments of your heart.</P>
<P>Having thus happily di&s;covered the method of decyphering your Lord&s;hip's invectives, I am not without &s;u&s;picion, that the &s;ame key mu&s;t be applied for con|&s;truing your applau&s;es. What &s;trengthens this conjecture is, that tho&s;e talents, which you are plea&s;ed to take from Dr. <HI>Bentley,</HI> you liberally be&s;tow upon <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 21.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Hobbes.</HI></P>
