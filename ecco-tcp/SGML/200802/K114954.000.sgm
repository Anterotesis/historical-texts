<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_AS it is very natural and commendable for every man to be ever inquiring after any di&s;covery or improvement that may be u&s;eful to his pro|fe&s;&s;ion, and to communicate it to the publick, I am willing to hope that the care and pains, the time and expence I have be&s;tow'd on the following Hi&s;tory, will be approv'd by every one who con&s;iders the nature, u&s;e and extent of it; and the rather, becau&s;e nothing has been yet publi&s;h'd, at lea&s;t in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> on the &s;ubject of <HI>PRINTING,</HI> &s;o methodical and comprehen&s;ive either in the <HI>Hi&s;torical</HI> or <HI>Practical</HI> part of it. As to the Hi&s;tory, I could not, without &s;ome regret, ob&s;erve that we had nothing in our own lan|guage but &s;ome few fragments di&s;pers'd in &s;everal Authors, who only &s;poke of it occa&s;ionally, whil&s;t &s;o many <HI>Italians, Germans</HI> and <HI>French</HI> had wrote &s;o copiou&s;ly upon it, and <HI>ex profe&s;&s;o.</HI> Tho' even the&s;e &s;eem rather to have had a view to the introduction and progre&s;s of the Art in their re&s;pective countries, than to the di&s;playing of its excellency and improvements. Neither did I find that any of them had given &s;o particular a Hi&s;tory of the Inven|tion and Inventors, or &s;o general a one of its progre&s;s and pro|mulgation through <HI>Europe,</HI> and beyond it, as I could have wi&s;h'd, or as I thought might be compiled.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
However, neither the&s;e con&s;iderations, nor the di&s;coveries I had made from &s;ome ancient and valuable editions I met with in &s;ome of our noble libraries, nor even the examples of &s;everal men of my profe&s;&s;ion abroad, who have writ largely on both the &s;ubjects, could have prevail'd upon me to have undertaken this <HI>Hi&s;torical</HI> part, which I knew de&s;erved a much better pen. The <HI>Practical</HI> being more within my province, my ambition reached no higher than to have publi&s;hed &s;uch a compleat &s;y&s;tem of it, from the helps I had received from Mr. <HI>Fertel</HI> and Mr. <HI>Jn. Andr. Endters,</HI> (two eminent Printers, the fir&s;t at St. <HI>Omer</HI>'s, and the other at <HI>Nuremberg,</HI> who have publi&s;hed two curious treati&s;es of it) and from my own ob&s;ervations and improvements on them; as few of my profe&s;&s;ion would have fail'd of being the better for in &s;ome branch or other of the Art. And I could with the utmo&s;t plea&s;ure have communicated all the other di&s;co|veries which I had occa&s;ionally made, to any per&s;on that would have been at the pains of writing this Hi&s;tory. But when I di&s;|cover'd my de&s;ign, I found, to my &s;urpri&s;e, that the Practical part would not meet with that encouragement and approbation I ex|pected, particularly from tho&s;e for who&s;e benefit and improvement I had chiefly de&s;ign'd it, tho' the publick could not but have been the better for it, by having much better and neater impre&s;&s;ions than are generally done.</P>
<P>Upon this account my friends and patrous per&s;uaded me to alter my De&s;ign, and to &s;u&s;pend the Practical part, till the Hi|&s;torical, which they pre&s;s'd me al&s;o to undertake, had in &s;ome mea&s;ure made way for it. Pur&s;uant therefore to this new plan, I re&s;olved to &s;pare neither co&s;t nor pains to get a &s;ight, or at lea&s;t a certain intelligence of all the Old editions that were valuable either for their antiquity, elegancy, or for any light they could give me into this Hi&s;tory, and to add my own
<PB N="5" REF="4">
ob&s;ervations upon them, not only as an hi&s;torian, but more e&s;pe|cially as a <HI>PRINTER.</HI> The Reader will find, by the &s;equel, that none but one of that profe&s;&s;ion, and one that is well vers'd in tho&s;e old ancient works can form a right judgment of them; and this is the rea&s;on that &s;o many of them have been mi&s;taken for Manu&s;cripts, or have been &s;uppo&s;ed to have been printed upon wooden blocks, even by per&s;ons otherwi&s;e very learned and judi|cious, whereas it is even demon&s;trable that they were done by &s;eparate metal types.</P>
<P>My next care was to read over all that has been writ hitherto upon the &s;ubject, e&s;pecially by the judicious <HI>Malinkrot,</HI> by <HI>De la Caille, Chevilier, Endters, P. Pater, Orlandi,</HI> and by the learned Mr. <HI>Maittaire,</HI> from all whom the Reader will find I have re|ceived no &s;mall helps, and which I do here gladly acknowledge; and if I have at any time ventured to di&s;&s;ent from them, I hope he will find my opinion back'd with &s;ufficient authority; but where that could not be obtained, I have contented my&s;elf with leading the Reader to the mo&s;t probable &s;ide. And it is with no &s;mall plea&s;ure that I have found one or two of my conjectures &s;ince confirm'd by the di&s;covery of &s;ome latent pieces, which were not known to them. They had indeed acce&s;s to the mo&s;t cele|brated Libraries of their own countries, but this Hi&s;tory will convince them that all that is valuable and curious is not con|fined to them, and that we have many as nobly and richly furni&s;h'd in our own as any in theirs.</P>
<P>And here I &s;hould be extremely ungrateful, if I did not take this opportunity of acknowledging the great helps and curious in|formations I have been favour'd with by &s;everal of the Patrons and Encouragers of this work, as well as my great obligations to the Right Honourable the Earls of <HI>Pembroke</HI> and <HI>Oxford,</HI> to whom I am proud to own my&s;elf beholden (but more e&s;pecially
<PB N="6" REF="5">
to the former,) for all the di&s;coveries which this Hi&s;tory has above any other extant. My free acce&s;s to tho&s;e two Libraries, as well as to tho&s;e of my very good friends Dr. <HI>Mead,</HI> Dr. <HI>Rawlin&s;on,</HI> Mr. <HI>Richard&s;on,</HI> and others, be&s;ides &s;ome of our pub|lick ones, &s;uch as tho&s;e of <HI>Oxford, Cambridge,</HI> and of the <HI>Middle Temple,</HI> have afforded me the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing many of tho&s;e &s;carce editions, which have been mention'd by mo&s;t Annali&s;ts, if we except Mr. <HI>Maittaire,</HI> either from Catalogues or hear-&s;ay. And here I gladly take this opportunity of returning my thanks to the&s;e learned Corre&s;pondents, who have favour'd me with any ourious intelligence from tho&s;e Libraries, which my Bu&s;ine&s;s and the bad &s;tate of health, would not permit me to vi&s;it.</P>
<P>The order of this Hi&s;tory is as follows.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t book contains an account of the Di&s;covery and In|ventors of the Art, whether really &s;uch, or only pretended, with remarks on their fir&s;t tryals upon Blocks, and their fir&s;t editions.</P>
<P>The &s;econd book treats of the promulgation of <HI>PRINTING</HI> into all the &s;everal cities and places in <HI>Europe,</HI> and the im|provements made to it by the mo&s;t eminent Printers down to <HI>An. 1520.</HI></P>
<P>The third gives an account of its fir&s;t introduction into <HI>Eng|land,</HI> its ri&s;e and progre&s;s in &s;everal cities, towns and mona|&s;teries; with the characters and works of the mo&s;t famous <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Printers to <HI>an. 1550,</HI> a fuller account of all which may be &s;een in the following <HI>Table of CONTENTS.</HI></P>
<P>This Performance I entirely &s;ubmit to the approbation or cen&s;ure of the curious and candid, as it &s;hall de&s;erve. And I &s;hall gain the main end I propos'd, if what I have done &s;hall contribute to &s;ome more full and elaborate productions of this nature.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">
<HI>Thus far Mr. PALMER's</HI> Preface <HI>to the Hi&s;torical part, as to what relates to the Practical, we need not trouble the Reader with it here. What the Author de&s;ign'd to treat of in it, may be &s;een by the</HI> Table of Contents <HI>prefix'd to the fir&s;t Number of this work. In this Table he will likewi&s;e find &s;everal particulars which were promis'd to be added to this Hi&s;tory, but which we have been obliged to omit, either for want of materials, or be|cau&s;e they were not thought &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to this work by the promoters of it. Of the fir&s;t &s;ort was the</HI> Hi&s;tory of Printing <HI>in</HI> Scotland <HI>and</HI> Ireland; <HI>concerning the former of which we can add nothing to the &s;hort account which was printed at</HI> Eden|burgh <HI>by Mr.</HI> Wat&s;on <HI>the King's Printer there; and as for</HI> Ire|land <HI>we are &s;till more in the dark for want of Memoirs. Mr. PALMER had likewi&s;e promis'd the Prints of the</HI> Rebus's <HI>of all the foreign eminent PRINTERS, but, as he had not got them cut before his death, and has given an account of them at the end of their works, it was thought that charge might as well be &s;pared; &s;o that we have only added tho&s;e which were u&s;ed by the mo&s;t con&s;iderable ones of our own nation. His li&s;t of the mo&s;t excellent PRINTERS from 1500 to this time; the &s;everal acts for regulating the Pre&s;s, and for &s;ecuring the property of Copies, being left very imperfect, the charge of fini&s;hing them was likewi&s;e thought unnece&s;&s;ary; for which rea&s;on they are al&s;o omitted.</HI></P>
<P><HI>All that needs be added with regard to his Practical part, is, that, as it was intended to have been printed fir&s;t, the Author has left it in &s;uch perfect order, that, if the Publick will be plea&s;ed to encourage it, an Edition may be ea&s;ily printed from his Manu&s;cript. 'Twere needle&s;s to tell the world how fit he was for &s;uch a work, what pains he has taken, and what improve|ments he made to it; tho&s;e who knew Mr. PALMER will think it &s;ufficient to &s;ay that the &s;ubject is the</HI> Art of Printing, <HI>and he the Author of it.</HI></P>

<HEAD>BOOK I. Of its Origin, Improvement and Progre&s;s by JOHN FAUST from 1440. to 1462.</HEAD>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. An Enquiry into the Ri&s;e of Printing.</HEAD>
<P>_MY de&s;ign is to give an hi&s;torical account of the authors, di&s;covery, improvement and progre&s;s of the Art of Printing; an Art &s;o highly beneficial to mankind, by pre&s;erving and tran&s;mitting to po&s;terity the trea|&s;ures of antient and modern learning, that its origi|nal has been e&s;teem'd divine. I &s;hall begin with a previous enquiry into the cau&s;es and concurrent circum&s;tances, which excited the inventors of it to a di&s;covery, that might an&s;wer this end, with more expedition and ex|actne&s;s, than <HI>Tran&s;cribing,</HI> the only method known before.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="13">
THE world at this time began to recover from a &s;tate of ignorance, under which it had labour'd many centuries; learning reviv'd, and was patroniz'd in almo&s;t every country of <HI>Europe;</HI> its votaries exerted a lau|dable zeal in &s;earching the libraries for tho&s;e valuable books, which had lain buried in ob&s;curity, and were become extremely &s;carce, great num|bers being lo&s;t in the times of ignorance. Manu&s;cripts were procur'd and multiplied; but the price of them was &s;uch, that none but men of for|tune could purcha&s;e them: 120 crowns for a <HI>Livy,</HI> and 80 crowns for three volumes of <HI>Plutarch</HI>'s Lives <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De tribus voluminibus PLUTARCHI in quibus parallela viginti quatuor continentur, titulos &s;ump&s;it, ut mones; pretium minus LXXX aureis e&s;&s;e non pote&s;t, &amp;c. <HI>Papiens.</HI> p 114. vet. edit.</NOTE>, was then a moderate price: a few manu&s;cripts were thought a portion worthy a nobleman's daughter; and one or two intitled the donor and his po&s;terity to the perpetual prayers of a mona&s;tery: nay kings them&s;elves di&s;dain'd not the office of procuring them for their learned friends, as appears from a letter of <HI>Antoninus Boca|tellus,</HI> &s;irnam'd <HI>Panormus,</HI> to <HI>Alphon&s;us</HI> king of <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Sicily</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Significa&s;ti mihi nuper ex Florentia extare TITI LIVII opera vaenalia, libros pulcherri|mos; libro pretium e&s;&s;e CXX aureos. Quare maje&s;tatem tuam oro, ut LIVIUM, quem re|gem librorum appellare con&s;uevimus, emi no|mine meo, ac venire ad nos facias; interim ego pecuniam procurabo, quam pro libri pre|tio tradam, Sed illud a prudentia tua &s;ciae de|&s;idero, uter ego an Pegnius melius fecerit; is, ut villam Florentiae emeret, LIVIUM vendidit, quem &s;ua manu pulcherrime &s;crip&s;erat; ego, ut LIVIUM emam, fundum pro&s;crip&s;i. Haec ut familiariter a te peterem, &s;ua&s;it humanitas &amp; mode&s;tia tua. Vale &amp; triumpha. <HI>Epi&s;tel.</HI> lib. 5.</NOTE>; and an old <HI>manu&s;cript hebrew bible</HI> was a pre&s;ent from the Emperor <HI>Frederick</HI> III. to <HI>Reuchlin,</HI> who was &s;ent emba&s;&s;ador to him. <HI>Paulus Jovius</HI> relates a plea|&s;ant &s;tory of one <HI>Ja&s;on Mainus,</HI> a &s;tudent of <HI>Pavia,</HI> who&s;e extravagance having brought him to a goal was oblig'd to depo&s;it a manu&s;cript <HI>Codex Juris</HI> on parchment, into the hands of an u&s;urer, in order to procure his enlargement: <HI>Petrarch</HI>'s rhetoric ma&s;ter likewi&s;e, by pledging two vo|lumes of <HI>Cicero</HI>'s works, &s;av'd him&s;elf from a pri&s;on.</P>
<P>As this exce&s;&s;ive price tempted &s;ome to purcha&s;e e&s;tates by the &s;ale of their books, and exchange learning for money; &s;o the learned at that time freely parted with their wealth to procure tho&s;e invaluable remains of antiquity, out of a generous de&s;ign to communicate them to the world.</P>
<P>THE Tran&s;cribers now had a favourable opportunity of enriching them|&s;elves, which they might have enjoy'd much longer, had not they (po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with the mo&s;t mercenary views) done an incredible, and in &s;ome ca&s;es ir|recoverable
<PB N="3" REF="14">
damage to learning, by mutilating and corrupting the be&s;t authors: hence ari&s;e tho&s;e frequent complaints again&s;t their negligence and ignorance, which have co&s;t the learned an infinite deal of labour to remedy: to evince this the following in&s;tance will &s;uffice.</P>
<P>JOHN ANDREAS, bi&s;hop of <HI>Aleria,</HI> one of the greate&s;t criticks of that age, tells Pope <HI>Paul</HI> II. in his dedication prefix'd to <HI>Pliny</HI>'s <HI>Natural Hi&s;tory</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In nonum annum premi non potuit emendatio, ne futura quidem exacta po&s;t nonage&s;imum.</NOTE>, printed at <HI>Rome</HI> in the hou&s;e of the <HI>Maximis</HI> by <HI>Panaratz</HI> and <HI>Sweyn|heim, anno</HI> 1470, that tho' he had &s;pent nine whole years in cor|recting that author; yet ninety more would not compleat a correct edi|tion. This demon&s;trates what difficulties the republick of learning en|counter'd with at it's revival; namely, the &s;carcity and exce&s;&s;ive price of books, and the &s;ordidne&s;s of the Tran&s;cribers, from who&s;e hands they came &s;o maim'd and incorrect, that the great Printer <HI>Stephens</HI> truly &s;aid, <HI>they were a plague to the purcha&s;er.</HI> The&s;e were motives &s;ufficient to ex|cite the Inventors of this Art to a di&s;covery &s;o beneficial to the world, and of &s;uch honour and advantage to them&s;elves: who tho&s;e excellent per&s;ons were, and where it was made, will come under our enquiry in its proper place. And here the reader will find ju&s;t cau&s;e of wonder, that this Art, which has been &s;tiled the nur&s;e and pre&s;erver of arts and &s;ciences, &s;hould (if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion) be &s;o forgetful of it&s;elf, as not to leave us the lea&s;t &s;ketch of its own hi&s;tory, the inventors being <HI>more ambitious of de&s;erving, than of purcha&s;ing prai&s;e.</HI> Some light indeed we receive in this affair from a few in&s;criptions u&s;ed by <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> at the end of his fir&s;t prin|ted books, to this purpo&s;e. <HI>This pre&s;ent work, with all its embelli&s;hments,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>was done, not with pen and ink,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>but by a new invented Art of ca&s;t|ing Letters, Printing,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>by me</HI> John Fau&s;t <HI>and my &s;on-in-law</HI> Peter Schoeffer <HI>in the famous city of</HI> Mentz <HI>upon the</HI> Rhine, <HI>anno&mdash;</HI>: but re|cour&s;e mu&s;t be had to the writers of tho&s;e times for the hi&s;tory of this In|vention. Many cities have contended for the glory of it, and engaged the learned in defence of their claim; but tho&s;e on the &s;ide of <HI>Harlem</HI> have manag'd the controver&s;y with great warmth, and charged <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> the Inven|tor with robbing his &s;uppo&s;ed ma&s;ter <HI>Laurence John Co&s;ter</HI> of many thou|&s;and weight of his materials, on Chri&s;tmas-Eve, when the whole family and city were in prayer at church; with other &s;uch ridiculous &s;tories, in|vented meerly to deprive this <HI>Great Man</HI> of the honour, which he had &s;o
<PB N="4" REF="15">
long inconte&s;tably enjoy'd. Had this been publi&s;h'd in his life-time, when he might have defended him&s;elf, or pre&s;ently after his death, when his &s;on-in-law or &s;ome of his friends might have done it for him, he had undoubtedly been clear'd; but &s;uch an accu&s;ation was not hinted till 125 years after, and then grounded only on &s;u&s;picion, as Dr. <HI>Junius</HI> owns <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ut fert &s;u&s;picio.</NOTE>, who was the fir&s;t that attempted to transfer this Di&s;covery from <HI>Mentz</HI> to <HI>Harlem.</HI> However <HI>Fau&s;t</HI>'s name died not with him, tho' &s;ome <HI>Dutch</HI> wri|ters made u&s;e of <HI>his art</HI> to a&s;per&s;e his memory: and others of &s;eve|ral nations ro&s;e immediately in his defence; in particular the learned <HI>Ma|lincrot,</HI> dean of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> in his treati&s;e <HI>De Ortu &amp; Progre&s;&s;u Artis Typogra|phicae,</HI> has not only refuted what was advanc'd on the other &s;ide, but made &s;uch re&s;earches after the old monuments of the Art, and collected &s;o great a variety of te&s;timonies, &s;upported by undeniable facts, as &s;eem at once to determine the controver&s;y. <HI>Boxhorn</HI> indeed attempted an an&s;wer; but whoever reads it over, cannot but be convinc'd, that an over-fondne&s;s for his country's honour has made him deaf to the mo&s;t evident demon&s;trati|ons of his antagoni&s;t. However as he and his followers, have given up the point as to &s;eparate Metal Types in favour of <HI>John Fau&s;t,</HI> and lay claim only to the invention of <HI>Printing on Blocks of Wood,</HI> which they affirm to have been &s;toln from <HI>Co&s;ter</HI> by <HI>Fau&s;t,</HI> who&s;e next invention they would have to be only an improvement of the former; I &s;hall give the reader an idea of both, and &s;hew the difference between tho&s;e fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays of Printing, and that perfect one, which &s;ucceeded and continues to this day.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. An Account of the different Manners of Printing by <HI>Blocks of Wood,</HI> and &s;eparate Metal Types.</HEAD>
<P>TIS agreed by mo&s;t writers on this &s;ubject, that about the year 1440, &s;everal attempts were made by &s;ome per&s;ons, with va&s;t expence and labour, which prov'd abortive; but that the di&s;covery of &s;eparate Metal Types was not brought to perfection till about the year 1450. We find that their fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays were by carving or cutting letters with a &s;harp-pointed knife upon Blocks of Wood, each Block containing a page or one &s;ide of a leaf; that in&s;tead of the common
<PB N="5" REF="16">
Ink, which is the &s;ort they fir&s;t us'd, they invented a more glutinous one which &s;ucceeded better, being le&s;s apt to &s;pread; that they pa&s;ted the two white &s;ides of each leaf together, to make them look like &s;ingle leaves: but of this I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak more particularly in &s;ome of the fol|lowing chapters. In the mean time I &s;hall endeavour to demon&s;trate that this invention has not that merit for ingenuity, u&s;efulne&s;s, or novelty, which the <HI>Dutch</HI> writers boa&s;t of.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to the fir&s;t, the only requi&s;ites are a tolerable genius, &s;harp tools, and a good copy: as to its u&s;efulne&s;s, the only advantage re&s;ulting from it, is, that whatever the book be, the forms remain intire, &s;o that as many editions as the author plea&s;es may be printed without the expence of a new compo&s;ition; but on the other hand, if we con&s;ider that tho&s;e forms are of no u&s;e to any other work, and the time and expence in cutting them very great, with the great &s;pace &s;o many Pages of Wood mu&s;t take up, we &s;hall perceive the nece&s;&s;ity of inventing moveable Me|tal Types: But farther, this method of Printing was far from being no|vel, it is even demon&s;trable from authentick te&s;timonies to have been pra|ctis'd in <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japan,</HI> above four centuries before it was known in <HI>Europe:</HI> it is not ea&s;y, I grant, to prove that we receiv'd it from them, becau&s;e of their va&s;t di&s;tance, and the little commerce between us before the year 1440: yet there is no impo&s;&s;ibility, but that it might have been brought us by &s;ome merchant either by the way of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> or the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> the <HI>Per&s;ian Gulph</HI> or <HI>Arabia:</HI> of which opinion I could mention many authors. <HI>Gonzala de Mendo&s;a,</HI> in his hi&s;tory of the <HI>Marvels of China,</HI> written in Spani&s;h, Book III. Chap. 16; and <HI>Martin Martini</HI> in his <HI>Atlas Sinen&s;is,</HI> tell us, that they could prove by good arguments, that the In|vention of <HI>Guns,</HI> of the <HI>Load&s;tone</HI> and <HI>Printing</HI> was known to us by their means. What adds to the probability of my conjecture is, that the <HI>Chi|ne&s;e</HI> to this day &s;end with their goods, printed papers in the manner of our &s;hop-keepers hand-bills, &s;everal of which I have &s;een; and 'tis not impo&s;&s;i|ble but the hint of Printing on Blocks of Wood might have been taken this way.</P>
<P>WHOEVER has a ju&s;t idea of the genius of the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> and <HI>Japone&s;e,</HI> will own their capacity to have invented the method of Printing with &s;eparate types, if their manner of writing had admitted it; but as they are known to write, not with letters, as other nations, but with characters, each of
<PB N="6" REF="17">
which &s;tands for a whole word; and that the number of tho&s;e characters a|mount at lea&s;t to 10,000, (tho' &s;ome authors reckon above 40,000); it would be impo&s;&s;ible to have ca&s;es large enough to contain 'em, be&s;ides the in&s;uperable difficulty of di&s;tingui&s;hing and retaining them in memo|ry. To return from this digre&s;&s;ion, let us now take a &s;hort view of the other new and more expeditious method.</P>
<P>IF we duely con&s;ider it in all its branches, it will evidently appear the re&s;ult of no &s;mall &s;tudy, time and co&s;t. The cutting the counter-punches and punches and &s;inking them into the matrices, the adju&s;ting them to the mould, that curious piece of mechani&s;m, for ca&s;ting &s;ingle letters; the difficulty of the whole manual operation of Letter-founding: in the Prin|ting, the di&s;po&s;ition of the ca&s;es, the curious contrivance of the &s;everal parts of the work between the compo&s;itors, correctors and pre&s;s-men, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> add to all this the fine invention of the Printing-pre&s;s, &s;o admirable for its mechanical fabrick, together with the curious apparatus nece&s;&s;ary for a Printing-hou&s;e, for an explication of who&s;e terms we mu&s;t refer to the &s;econd volume of this work: the&s;e are things which require a genius va&s;t|ly &s;uperior to devi&s;e, better hands to execute, greater foreca&s;t to obviate, and readine&s;s to remedy all unexpected defects, more time and patience to go thro' all its various parts, more re&s;olution to overcome all difficulties, and la&s;tly the expences nece&s;&s;ary to this invention va&s;tly larger than tho&s;e of the former; and con&s;equently we &s;hall be far from thinking an interval of ten years too long, but rather admire that &s;uch a prodigious de&s;ign could be contriv'd and perfected in &s;o &s;hort a time.</P>
<P>WHAT has been &s;aid on this head, will &s;ufficiently demon&s;trate the di&s;|parity between the&s;e two methods, and convince the reader how much the former is inferior in every re&s;pect to the latter; nay, if we dare rely on the judgment of the learned, we &s;hould &s;carce think it worthy the name of Printing, &s;ince it has nothing common with it except the ink; and even a rowler, cover'd with cloath, would &s;upply the place of a pre&s;s to print their Pages of Wood.</P>
<P>NOW whether it be <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> or <HI>Co&s;ter,</HI> who practis'd this method on wood fir&s;t, whether <HI>Mentz, Harlem,</HI> or any other city, gave it fir&s;t encourage|ment; whether the afore-nam'd per&s;ons had the hint from <HI>China,</HI> or hap|pen'd on it accidentally, (tho' if we admit of the latter &s;uppo&s;ition, <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> and <HI>Mentz</HI> have the better title); this mu&s;t be granted from what has
<PB N="7" REF="18">
been &s;aid, that by Printing we do not under&s;tand the method of Printing on Blocks of Wood claim'd by <HI>Harlem,</HI> but the pre&s;ent Art of Printing by &s;eparate Metal Types, which is &s;o ju&s;tly admir'd for its expeditious and correct way of pre&s;erving and propagating knowledge; and to which we owe the improvements made in mo&s;t arts and &s;ciences for near three cen|turies pa&s;t.</P>
<P>HENCE it appears how little rea&s;on the <HI>Dutch</HI> writers have to value them|&s;elves upon an imaginary victory, which, were it granted in its fulle&s;t ex|tent, would be de&s;picable in compari&s;on of the other. Yet <HI>Boxhorn</HI> in his <HI>Theatrum Hollandiae,</HI> page 142. places his hero <HI>Co&s;ter</HI> in a kind of tri|umphal chariot, dragging his vanqui&s;h'd enemies the <HI>Germans</HI> and <HI>French</HI> after him, with a pompous in&s;cription, which I think worthy the cu|rious readers notice <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LG>

1450.) in the city of <HI>Mentz</HI> in <HI>Germany</HI> upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and not in <HI>Italy,</HI> as &s;ome writers fal&s;ly affirm'd, the wonderful and <HI>till then un|known Art</HI> of Printing Books by Metal Types <HI>[characterizandi]</HI> was in|vented and devis'd by <HI>John Guttenberg,</HI> citizen of <HI>Mentz;</HI> who having almo&s;t exhau&s;ted his whole e&s;tate in contriving of this new Method, and labouring under &s;uch in&s;uperable difficulties, in one re&s;pect or other, that he began to de&s;pair of, and to throw up the whole de&s;ign; was at length a&s;&s;i&s;ted with the advice and pur&s;e of <HI>John Fau&s;t,</HI> another ci|tizen of <HI>Mentz,</HI> and happily brought it to perfection. Having there|fore begun with cutting characters of the letters upon wooden planks, in their right order, and compleated their forms, they printed the vo|cabulary intitled <HI>Catholicon;</HI> but could make no farther u&s;e of tho&s;e forms, becau&s;e there was no po&s;&s;ibility of &s;eparating the letters, which were engraven on the planks, as we hinted before. To this &s;ucceeded a more ingenious invention; for they found out a way of &s;tamping the &s;hapes of every letter of the <HI>Latin</HI> Alphabet, in what they call Matri|ces, from which they afterwards ca&s;t their letters, either in copper or tin, hard enough to be printed upon, which they fir&s;t cut with their own hands. It is certain this art met with no &s;mall difficulties from the beginning of its invention, as I heard 30 years ago from the mouth of <HI>Peter Schoeffer de Gern&s;heim,</HI> citizen of <HI>Mentz,</HI> and <HI>Son-in-law to the fir&s;t Inventor of the Art.</HI> For when they went about printing the Bible, before they had work'd off the third quire, it had co&s;t them already above 4000 florins. But the afore-mention'd <HI>Peter Schoeffer,</HI> then &s;er|vant and afterwards <HI>Son-in-law to the fir&s;t Inventor</HI> John Fau&s;t, as we hinted before, being a per&s;on of great ingenuity, di&s;cover'd an ea&s;ier method of ca&s;ting letters, and perfected the art as we now have it. The&s;e three kept this manner of printing very &s;ecret for &s;ome time,
<PB N="12" REF="23">
until it was divulg'd by their &s;ervants, without who&s;e help it was im|po&s;&s;ible to manage the bu&s;ine&s;s, who carry'd it fir&s;t to <HI>Strasburg,</HI> and by degrees all over <HI>Europe.&mdash;</HI>Thus much will &s;uffice concerning the di&s;covery of this wonderful art, the fir&s;t inventors of which were citizens of <HI>Mentz.&mdash;</HI>The&s;e three fir&s;t di&s;coverers of printing, <HI>viz.

<P>FROM this authentick te&s;timony, I &s;hall beg leave to make the follow|ing ob&s;ervations, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. That when the author concluded his Chronicle, <HI>ann.</HI> 1514. two years before his death, and above 64 years after the di&s;co|very, this invention was indi&s;putably a&s;crib'd to <HI>Mentz;</HI> he &s;ays indeed that &s;ome writers had attributed it to <HI>Italy,</HI> but without any foundation; and therefore he rejects this notion as ab&s;olutely fal&s;e. Yet <HI>Junius,</HI> as has been already hinted, fir&s;t &s;tarted a di&s;pute in favour of <HI>Harlem,</HI> almo&s;t 130 years after the art became known; and after him Dr. <HI>Mentel</HI> began another in favour of <HI>Strasburgh, ann.</HI> 1650, both which &s;hall be an&s;wer'd in their places.</P>
<P>THE next ob&s;ervation is, that tho' the pa&s;&s;age quoted out of his fir&s;t Chronicle &s;eems to be taken, if not copy'd out of that of <HI>Mentz,</HI> which is likewi&s;e a very antient and authentick monument, yet our author &s;eems not to have been &s;atisfy'd with it, till he had it confirm'd by &s;urer hands. Other authors indeed have written concerning the origin of this art, ac|cording to the be&s;t memoirs they could procure, whether true or fal&s;e; but our author alone has been at the pains to fetch his information from the fountain head, and deliver'd the particulars of it, as he receiv'd 'em from the principal agent in the invention, in the quotation from his &s;econd Chronicle: &s;o that his te&s;timony, were it the only one we could pro|duce for <HI>Mentz,</HI> ought &s;till to be e&s;teem'd unque&s;tionable and de|ci&s;ive.</P>
<P>ANOTHER particular worth our ob&s;ervation is, that tho' he mentions two books as printed immediately upon the di&s;covery, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Catholicon</HI> and the <HI>Bible,</HI> yet he &s;ufficiently &s;hews the difference between the methods of their impre&s;&s;ion; the former being done upon wooden planks, cut with a knife after the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> manner, as our wooden cutts are done now; whereas the <HI>Bible</HI> was printed with &s;eparate types, which, as we &s;hew'd in
<PB N="13" REF="24">
the preceding chapter, is the only way that merits the name of <HI>Printing.</HI> This &s;eems plainly intimated by the words in the citation before-mentioned, <HI>When they came to print the Bible; and by the va&s;t expence they had been at before they fini&s;h'd the third quire of it:</HI> from which it is evident, that this &s;acred book was the fir&s;t work of con&s;equence which the authors of this art made choice of to &s;ignalize the fir&s;t-fruits of their invention.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t thing I would ob&s;erve is, that tho' <HI>Trithemius</HI> gives the prece|dency of this di&s;covery to <HI>John Guttenbergh,</HI> in the beginning of this pa&s;|&s;age, yet within a few lines after, he twice gives the title of <HI>The fir&s;t inven|tor of Printing</HI> to <HI>John Fau&s;t;</HI> which contradiction cannot be well recon|cil'd otherwi&s;e, than by &s;uppo&s;ing that he, thro' inadvertency, wrote the name of <HI>John Guttenberg</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>John Fau&s;t</HI> and this is far from being improbable, &s;ince their chri&s;tian names are the &s;ame: and tho' he again puts <HI>Guttenbergh</HI> fir&s;t, when he &s;peaks of the hou&s;e in which they liv'd, yet this might be done only out of re&s;pect to him, either as being a knight (according to the writers of that time), or becau&s;e he was the mo&s;t opulent of the three, and had contributed mo&s;t to the charges of the in|vention.</P>
<P>THIS mu&s;t be allow'd, unle&s;s we could &s;uppo&s;e that the editor having compar'd the two pa&s;&s;ages together, namely, that out of the fir&s;t, and this out of the &s;econd Chronicle, had corrected, as he imagin'd, the lat|ter by the former, upon a &s;u&s;picion, that the author writing the la&s;t al|mo&s;t 30 years after he had receiv'd the account from <HI>Schoeffer,</HI> might have mi&s;taken one name for the other; but to be certain of this, it would be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to con&s;ult the original. However, what confirms me in my conje|cture is, that the author or his editor have committed a mi&s;take, and that <HI>Guttenberg</HI> had no other intere&s;t in the di&s;covery than by a&s;&s;i&s;ting them with money to promote the de&s;ign, is, the law-&s;uit which he commenc'd again&s;t <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> at <HI>Mentz</HI> about the money expended, and the judgment of the court thereupon; of which the learned <HI>Salmuth</HI> has given the follow|ing account in his appendix to <HI>Pancirol</HI>'s commentaries <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Eodem tempore <HI>Moguntiae</HI> commore|batur <HI>Johannes Guttenbergius,</HI> hone&s;tis pa|rentibus natus, qui proxime <HI>Fau&s;ti</HI> aedibus ha|bitabat.

The remainder of this pa&s;&s;age chiefly relates to the di&s;per&s;ion and pro|mulgation of the art; and therefore is unnece&s;&s;ary to be &s;et down here. There is but one thing in this quotation that can puzzle the reader; which is, that the author makes <HI>Guttenbergh</HI> to have been one of <HI>Fau&s;t</HI>'s &s;ervants, in&s;tead of his partner and u&s;urer as has been &s;hewed already; in the re&s;t he exactly agrees with the writers quoted before. With re&s;pect to the di&s;agreement among authors concerning the names of the fir&s;t inventors, if we remember that <HI>Guttenbergh,</HI> to evade the &s;entence pro|nounc'd again&s;t him at <HI>Mentz,</HI> departed with &s;ome of <HI>Fau&s;t</HI>'s workmen to <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> it will not appear improbable that &s;ome, who wrote at a di&s;tance, might confound him with tho&s;e &s;ervants, e&s;pecially con&s;idering that his name was never in any Book printed at <HI>Mentz.</HI> However 'tis plain that a place of one writer mi&s;taken by another, has been the occa&s;i|on of leading many more, who have follow'd him implicitely, into the &s;ame error. An in&s;tance of this, which will be no digre&s;&s;ion from our hi&s;tory, is as follows.</P>
<P>THE authors who have follow'd <HI>Peter Ramus,</HI> from <HI>Sabellicus, Zurin|ger,</HI> &amp;c. down to <HI>Paul Pater,</HI> author of the treati&s;e <HI>De Germaniae Mira|culo</HI> [the Art of Printing] publi&s;h'd <HI>ann.</HI> 1709 have a&s;crib'd this inven|tion to <HI>J. Regiomontanus,</HI> and thought they did the Art no &s;mall honour, in making &s;o great a Mathematician its author. What &s;eem'd to con|firm their opinion was, that <HI>Fau&s;t, Guttenbergh</HI> and he were contempo|raries, and 'tis probable, liv'd near each other; tho' he afterwards re|mov'd to <HI>Nurembergh.</HI> What made this &s;till more probable was, that <HI>Regiomontanus</HI> perfectly under&s;tood Mechanicks, &s;o that, as it is &s;aid, he made an iron Fly&s;pring from under his hand; fly round the room with a humming noi&s;e, and return back under his hand; he is likewi&s;e report|ed to have made a wooden Eagle, which flew from <HI>Nurembergh</HI> to meet the Emperor, hover'd over his head in a tonick motion, and went back the &s;ame way with him. It would be dangerous now to a&s;&s;ert the truth of the&s;e &s;tories, &s;ince &s;uch flights of ingenuity have been &s;o long di&s;cou|rag'd, to make way for more u&s;eful inventions; yet <HI>Jul. Scaliger</HI> was &s;o far from doubting of them, that he pretends to have found out the Art, and bragg'd that he could perform the like with a wet finger. Howe|ver this was &s;ufficient to per&s;uade our authors that <HI>Regiomontanus,</HI> repu|ted &s;o univer&s;al an arti&s;t, was mo&s;t probably the per&s;on who invented
<PB N="22" REF="33">
the method of Printing, and communicated it to <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> and <HI>Guttenbergh;</HI> in con&s;equence of which they have plac'd him at the head of the other two. Neverthele&s;s this notion &s;eems to take its ri&s;e from a pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Purbach</HI>'s tables, wherein 'tis &s;aid that the di&s;covery of Printing is to be refer'd to the times of <HI>Regiomontanus,</HI> as <HI>Malinkrot</HI> has fully prov'd. This &s;tory, I hope, will both convince the reader of the danger of fol|lowing an author too implicitely, and ju&s;tify my differin from the ge|nerality of tho&s;e who attribute the di&s;covery to <HI>John Guttenbergh,</HI> who&s;e opinion I apprehend to be &s;ufficiently confuted. Setting a&s;ide this mi&s;|take of <HI>P. Ramus</HI> with re&s;pect to <HI>Regiomontanus,</HI> he agrees with the re&s;t of our other te&s;timonies in favour of <HI>Fau&s;t;</HI> and I conceive it to be not in the lea&s;t improbable, that the inventors might, in &s;uch a variety of tools, implements, and other things nece&s;&s;ary to the perfecting this Art, have recour&s;e to him or &s;ome other ingenious per&s;on, for advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>HOWEVER it is certain that <HI>Regiomontanus</HI> was a very early printer, tho' not taken notice of as &s;uch by any writer I have met with.

which 'tis rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, not only by his being contemporary with, but a&s;&s;i&s;tant to, <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> in perfecting this art: however as <HI>Regiomontanus</HI> was a man of &s;uch profound &s;kill in a&s;tronomy, mechanicks, and &s;everal other branches of learning, I am willing to hope time will bring forth &s;ome further te&s;timonies concerning him.</P>
<P>BUT what convinces me that he had no &s;hare in the fir&s;t di&s;covery of the Art, is that in his long dedication prefix'd to his <HI>A&s;tronomical Tables,</HI> the fir&s;t piece he ever publi&s;h'd, which I have &s;een, and which is de|dicated to the Primate of <HI>Hungary,</HI> he doth not make the lea&s;t men|tion of his having been concern'd in &s;uch a noble di&s;covery, which it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e he would have done, could he have claim'd &s;uch a &s;ingular piece of merit to have recommended him to &s;o great a patron; e&s;pecially when he expatiates &s;o much upon the difficulties that attended the work he dedicates to him: but to return.</P>

<P>IF the te&s;timonies alledg'd in the preceding chapter are in&s;ufficient to convince any per&s;on that this invention is due to <HI>Fau&s;t;</HI> what follows in this will, I conceive, put it quite out of doubt, unle&s;s he be more in|credulous in this ca&s;e than a <HI>Dutchman:</HI> for the great <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> has not on|ly own'd him&s;elf convinc'd of this truth by one &s;ingle fact, but even tran&s;mitted it to po&s;terity.

printed by him, in con&s;ideration of his being grand-&s;on to the fir&s;t Inventor of the art of Printing: concerning whom <HI>Era&s;mus,</HI> who fir&s;t publi&s;h'd that work, &s;peaks in his preface to it as follows: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If tho&s;e, who furni&s;h'd <HI>Origen</HI> and St. <HI>Jerom</HI> with writers and parchments, have merited the highe&s;t commendation; what prai&s;e is due to Printers and Book&s;ellers, who &s;upply us with whole volumes for a &s;mall price?

<P>UPON the whole 'tis my opinion, that were there no other evidence but the&s;e in&s;criptions, they would be &s;ufficient to determine this contro|ver&s;y, &s;eeing neither <HI>Harlem, Strasburgh,</HI> nor any other place can pro|duce any thing equivalent.

'Tis certain that there is no book known to be printed at <HI>Harlem</HI> or any other place, of equal date with the la&s;t which were done by <HI>Fau&s;t,</HI> tho' it has been prov'd, that he con|tinu'd printing near ten years before he put his name to his impre&s;&s;ions: whence it follows, that he was not only the fir&s;t Printer with fu&s;ile me|tal types, but likewi&s;e the fir&s;t inventor of them, according to the te&s;ti|monies quoted in the preceding chapter.</P>
<P>I doubt not but the reader is now willing to hear what methods the competitors with <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> take, in order to evade &s;uch a cloud of authentick te&s;timonies; and what arguments they can allege in defence of their claim: in &s;hort, what grounds they have of triumphing in &s;uch an extra|ordinary manner. But I mu&s;t here acquaint him, that if he expects evi|dence an&s;werable to tho&s;e clamours, he will be extremely di&s;appointed in the two next chapters. However, &s;ince a controver&s;y cannot be fairly

<HEAD>CHAP. V. The Preten&s;ions of <HI>Harlem</HI> examin'd and con|futed.</HEAD>
<P>I Have more than once hinted, that this controver&s;y in favour of <HI>Harlem</HI> was not &s;tarted till above 125 years after the di&s;covery of the art, when <HI>Hadrian Junius,</HI> M. D. began the di&s;pute. During that long interval, the invention was univer&s;ally a&s;cribed to the city of <HI>Mentz,</HI> tho' the names of the inventors were &s;ometimes confounded; and what ought to &s;urpri&s;e us mo&s;t of all is, that not one <HI>Dutch</HI> writer, during that time, ever offer'd to contradict the received opinion concerning <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> and <HI>Mentz;</HI> tho' many of them were men of great learning, and &s;ome either natives of <HI>Harlem,</HI> or had been educated in that univer&s;ity. 'Tis really wonderful, that neither regard to truth, or their country's honour, nor the common ambition of being the author of a new di&s;|covery, &s;hould have in&s;pir'd &s;ome of them to undeceive the world in this point, if they had the lea&s;t grounds of &s;u&s;picion. But whatever be the rea&s;on of this unpardonable &s;upinene&s;s in them, Dr. <HI>Junius,</HI> rather than fall under &s;uch a charge, undertook a task, as difficult as that <HI>Egyptian</HI> one, of making brick without &s;traw. For from a collection of old traditions, wooden types, and two or three books, printed on wood, without name, date, or any other mark (by which it might be gue&s;s'd when, where, and by whom they were done), with &s;ome other tran&s;|muted relicks of the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays of the art, he has form'd a &s;tory, which he thinks will baffle all the te&s;timonies urg'd on the other &s;ide, and turn the panegyricks, be&s;tow'd by the learned on the noble inventor, into the vile&s;t calumnies.

I &s;hall therefore relate what has been told me by &s;ome grave and worthy old <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> who have fill'd the be&s;t offices in the city, and heard it from others of equal weight and authority; <HI>viz.</HI> That about 128 years ago, there liv'd at a noted hou&s;e, &s;tanding to this day, over again&s;t the Royal Palace, one <HI>Laurence John,</HI> &s;irnam'd <HI>Co&s;ter,</HI> (which word &s;ignifies a &s;exton or church-warden; or, in the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> &s;en&s;e one who is intru&s;ted with all the rich plate, &s;umptuous robes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> belonging to the pari&s;h church; a place hereditary in his family,) who was the per&s;on to whom the Art of Printing owes its original, tho' he has been unju&s;tly depriv'd of that honour.&mdash;That walking by chance in an adjacent wood, according to cu&s;tom, after a full meal, or on holy-days, he cut &s;ome letters out of the bark of beech-trees; which being inverted and joyn'd together, he began to print &s;ome words, and then whole lines, in hopes that this might turn to the advantage of his grand-children: that the &s;ucce&s;s of this prompted him to greater di&s;coveries, he being a man of an extraordinary geni|us: that he with <HI>Thomas Peter</HI> his &s;on-in-law, finding the common ink apt to &s;pread, invented a more glutinous &s;ort, and began to print whole pages; of which kind I &s;aw &s;ome e&s;&s;ays in an anonymous work, printed only on one &s;ide, and entitled the <HI>Mirour of our Salvati|on,</HI> written in <HI>Low Dutch,</HI> the white &s;ides of the paper being glew'd together to hide the cha&s;ms: that after this he chang'd his wooden let|ters into lead; and then into tin, which was &s;till harder and more du|rable: &s;ome of the&s;e old types being ca&s;t into drinking-cups are &s;till

to be &s;een at the afore&s;aid hou&s;e, out of which <HI>Gerard Thomas, Co&s;ter</HI>'s great-grand-&s;on, dy'd a few years ago. But as all new inventions meet with encouragement, this art began to require a greater number of hands, which prov'd the fir&s;t cau&s;e of mi&s;chief to this family: for one of his &s;ervants nam'd <HI>John</HI> (but whether <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> or not I &s;hall not now enquire) being employ'd in this bu&s;ine&s;s, after having taken an oath of &s;ecrecy, had no &s;ooner learn'd, as he thought, the method of ca&s;ting and joining the fu&s;ile types, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but he took the next op|portunity of robbing his ma&s;ter of all his printing-tools, together with his art: to which end he cho&s;e the night before <HI>Chri&s;tma&s;s,</HI> as the mo&s;t proper for his de&s;ign, when the whole family, with the re&s;t of the city were at church at midnight-ma&s;s. Thence he e&s;cap'd to <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> next to <HI>Cologn,</HI> and at la&s;t &s;ettled at <HI>Mentz;</HI> where the year following, <HI>viz. ann.</HI> 1442 he printed <HI>Alexandri Galli doctrinale,</HI> a grammar much in vogue at that time, with tho&s;e very types that his ma&s;ter <HI>Co&s;ter</HI> had us'd before.
<P>THIS is the &s;ub&s;tance of what I had from tho&s;e gentlemen of vera|city, who told me they had it handed down by tradition; and this has been likewi&s;e confirm'd to me by others of equal repute. I re|member to have heard my tutor <HI>Nich. Gallius,</HI> an old gentleman of a very tenacious memory, &s;ay, that when he was a boy, he heard one <HI>Cornelius</HI> a printer, an old man, who had been one of <HI>Co&s;ter</HI>'s workmen, mention the &s;tory of the fir&s;t trials of printing, with a great deal of vehemence, and even with tears, e&s;pecially when he came to the thievi&s;h part of it; prote&s;ting he could execute the rogue him&s;elf with the utmo&s;t plea&s;ure, if he had been alive then; cur&s;ing tho&s;e nights, in which, for near three months together, he had lain with &s;o vile a mi&s;creant. A &s;tory like this one <HI>Quirinus Tale&s;ius</HI> reports that he had heard from the &s;ame Printer.</P>
<P>THIS is what my &s;incere love of truth oblig'd me to publi&s;h, what|ever the con&s;equence be,&mdash;but I am fearful that prejudice in this ca&s;e will out-balance rea&s;on and authority. The pa&s;&s;ing of this in|vention into <HI>Germany</HI> in a lawful way had been no harm; nay, I be|lieve that it plea&s;ed God to make it the means of perfecting and di|vulging &s;o u&s;eful an art, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</P></Q></P>

HERE is all that our author could collect in defence of his cau&s;e, which he had made the be&s;t of after his way: it were indeed to be wi&s;h'd, the Doctor had rather imitated the mode&s;ty of <HI>Carneades,</HI> than wi&s;h'd for his eloquence; &s;ince that great philo&s;opher (however he &s;eems to forget it) never was known to affirm any thing. Convinc'd as he was of the weakne&s;s of human under&s;tanding, and of the power of prejudice; he al|ways contented him&s;elf with confuting the opinions of others, without ever &s;hewing that he held any of his own: but &s;uch an excellent talent would have &s;poil'd his de&s;ign, and condemn'd both his book and his old men's fables to ob&s;curity and oblivion, and &s;aved &s;ome other authors the trouble of writing in the vindication of either; but tho' he has been follow'd by about a dozen of his country-men, yet no additional te&s;timo|nies are to be expected from any of them: for even <HI>Boxhorn,</HI> who wrote with the greate&s;t vehemence and &s;pleen again&s;t <HI>Malinkrot,</HI> has been ob|lig'd to content him&s;elf with palliating the account of <HI>Junius,</HI> and en|deavouring to &s;hew, that it is not quite &s;o improbable as his antagoni&s;t hath repre&s;ented it. However it mu&s;t be owned, that except the two la&s;t nam'd authors, and one or two more, <HI>viz.

I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t upon his ra&s;hne&s;s in chu&s;ing to go thro' &s;uch publick roads and noted ci|ties, and thereby running the danger of being &s;eized; the con&s;equence of which would have been capital puni&s;hment: nor upon the unaccoun|table &s;upinene&s;s of his ma&s;ter in not pur&s;uing nor cau&s;ing him to be ap|prehended, when he open'd &s;hop at <HI>Mentz,</HI> where he could ea&s;ily have reach'd him: nor yet upon the probability, that the publick mu&s;t have been obliged, by this daring attempt of robbing the country of &s;uch a glorious di&s;covery, to pro&s;ecute the robber with the utmo&s;t &s;everity where ever he could be found.</P>
<P>IN the next place &s;hould we grant that <HI>Fau&s;t,</HI> or &s;ome other &s;ervants had &s;tollen the types; does it nece&s;&s;arily follow that he carry'd away the art with them? Could neither <HI>Co&s;ter,</HI> nor his &s;on-in-law and a&s;&s;i&s;tant <HI>Tho.

Be&s;ides, it appears from <HI>Junius</HI> that &s;ome of the types were left behind, which were after|wards transformed into drinking-ve&s;&s;els: if the&s;e were not &s;ufficient to &s;et them to work again, the interval of ten years, <HI>viz.</HI> from the pretended robbery <HI>anno</HI> 1441, to the divulging of the art <HI>anno</HI> 1452, was more than enough to have compleated a new &s;et; &s;eeing the fir&s;t inventors de|vis'd, try'd, and perfected this method in le&s;s time.

he might have renew'd his works, there being no want of buyers, and in&s;crib'd his books after this or &s;ome &s;uch manner; <HI>This work was done at</HI> Harlem <HI>by</HI> L. J.

How the devi&s;ers and publi&s;hers of it can maintain it with &s;o much po&s;itivene&s;s and vehemence, with &s;uch calum|nies, invectives and ill language, again&s;t per&s;ons of incomparable learn|ing, who could not give into &s;uch an ab&s;urd and legendary account, is not my bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that their charge up|on a man of &s;uch con&s;picuous merit as <HI>John Fau&s;t</HI> recoils with double force and &s;hame upon them&s;elves; for it proves them guilty of a crime more flagrant than what they accu&s;e him of, in endeavouring to deprive him not only of the glory of that invention, in order to fix it upon an imaginary country-man of theirs; but even of what is mo&s;t valuable in the world, his reputation, upon the bare te&s;timony and tradition of three old citizens, who&s;e memory is as ju&s;tly que&s;tionable, as their and <HI>Juni|us</HI>'s impartiality, in a ca&s;e wherein the honour of their city and fellow-ci|tizens is concern'd; and what is &s;till a greater aggravation of their unju&s;t calumny, to make u&s;e of <HI>Fau&s;t</HI>'s noble di&s;covery to publi&s;h and perpetu|ate his &s;hame, who&s;e honour and memory ought rather to have been ce|lebrated by it: little did that good man think, that his art would ever be put to &s;o vile a u&s;e again&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, I mu&s;t not omit to remark, that of all the writers, whom we have quoted for <HI>Mentz,</HI> and of many more collected by the di|ligent <HI>Malinkrot</HI> in his <HI>Hi&s;tory of Printing,</HI> there is not one native of that city. <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> indeed was born near it, but educated at a greater di|&s;tance; and <HI>Serrarius,</HI> tho' he liv'd &s;ometime there, was born in <HI>Lorain;</HI> yet if &s;uch an objection had been ju&s;t again&s;t ten or twelve of 'em, there remains enough to fix the laurel on <HI>Fau&s;t</HI>'s head. But with re&s;pect to the old evidences of <HI>Harlem,</HI> we only know what <HI>Junius</HI> is pleas'd to tell us of them, that they were per&s;ons who &s;erv'd &s;everal con&s;iderable offices in the city. However <HI>Malinkrot</HI> makes a very &s;hrewd remark upon one of:
<PB N="44" REF="55">
them, <HI>viz. Cornelius</HI> the Printer, who in a &s;ally of pa&s;&s;ion wi&s;h'd <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> had been then alive, that he might have executed him with his own hands; and was at that time, as <HI>Junius</HI> relates, above eighty years old: now as this theft is pretended to have been committed <HI>anno</HI> 1441, and it appears from an edition of <HI>Tully</HI>'s <HI>offices</HI> that <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> was living <HI>anno</HI> 1466; it is plain that in this &s;pace of 25 years <HI>Cornelius</HI> might have had an oppor|tunity of gratifying his revenge upon him if he had thought fit. This circum&s;tance therefore, which was contriv'd to add weight to the &s;tory, &s;erves only to burle&s;que and overthrow it.</P>

<P>THEY do not affirm, 1. that the old method of printing on wood was the foundation of the new one: 2. that this <HI>Donatus</HI> was printed at <HI>Harlem</HI> rather than at any other place, or by <HI>Co&s;ter</HI> than any other per|&s;on: tho' if they had a&s;&s;erted this, it ought to be examin'd how they got that intelligence; &s;eeing it was not known in <HI>Holland ann.</HI> 1575. in which year <HI>Junius</HI> dy'd, that any &s;uch book had been printed there; for that author, who was indefatigable in collecting whatever favour'd his cau&s;e, would never have fail'd to mention it; and <HI>Jo&s;. Scaliger,</HI> tho' he &s;ince de|clar'd
<PB N="46" REF="57">
him&s;elf for <HI>Harlem,</HI> formerly attributed this rude invention to the city of <HI>Dort:</HI> 3. they don't affirm that this <HI>Donatus</HI> was printed before the <HI>Catholicon</HI> of <HI>Mentz,</HI> wherein lies the main point; for tho' they &s;ay it was done before <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> had perfected his invention, yet it does not fol|low that it was before he had begun to print with wooden planks. No|thing therefore can be gather'd from the&s;e authors, even with re&s;pect to this invention in wood, that favours <HI>Co&s;ter</HI> or <HI>Harlem</HI> more than <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> or <HI>Mentz.</HI></P>
<P>I have already ob&s;erv'd that &s;ome of the <HI>Dutch</HI> writers are for divi|ding the glory between tho&s;e two corrivals, and particularly <HI>Peter Ber|chius:</HI> in this he is follow'd by no le&s;s an author than <HI>Boxhorn,</HI> &s;o often mention'd for his zeal in this di&s;pute.

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. An Enquiry into the <HI>fir&s;t Books</HI> printed on <HI>Blocks</HI> of <HI>Wood,</HI> viz. the <HI>Donatus, Speculum,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AS the reader may rea&s;onably think, there is &s;omething exceilent in the&s;e Books, either for beauty of impre&s;&s;ion, learning, correct|ne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from the great noi&s;e which they have made among the writers of this controver&s;y; I mu&s;t begin with acquainting him that their whole merit con&s;i&s;ts only in their being look'd upon by them as the very fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays of the art of printing, even before the invention of fu&s;ile types. This is &s;o far from admitting of any controver&s;y, however &s;ome of them may have been mi&s;led into a contrary opinion, that their being print|ed only on one &s;ide of the paper, and afterwards glew'd together, on the blank &s;ide, from which they were call'd <HI>paginae conglutinatae,</HI> is a very pregnant proof of their being done after the fir&s;t method, <HI>viz.</HI> upon wood|en blocks; tho'we &s;hall not only corroborate the fact by many other un|deniable arguments in the &s;equel of this chapter, but even lead the rea|der into &s;o plain a method of judging of tho&s;e works, from tho&s;e printed by fu&s;ile types, that he will not have the lea&s;t room left to doubt of it.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Donatus,</HI> &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted upon, by <HI>Bertius</HI> and others, in favour of <HI>Harlem,</HI> it is a que&s;tion whether there be one copy of it ex|tant, &s;eeing 'tis not to be met with in any of tho&s;e curious libraries I have either &s;een or heard of, nor could ever be procured by any of our &s;earch|ers into the&s;e antient monuments, tho' they have &s;par'd neither pains nor co&s;t to have it &s;ought for far and near: to which let me add, that no au|thor I am acquainted with, has pretended to have &s;een it, if we except <HI>Angel Rocha,</HI> who in his <HI>Bibliotheca Vaticana,</HI> printed at <HI>Rome</HI> in the year 1591, <HI>4to.</HI> pag. 411, tells us, that <HI>Aldus Manutius, jun^r.</HI> &s;hew'd him a grammar of <HI>Donatus</HI> printed on vellum, upon one of the fir&s;t white leaves of which <HI>Mariangelus Accur&s;ius,</HI> a learned author living in <HI>Italy</HI> about the year 1500 had wrote, as he &s;uppos'd, with his own hand, the following words in latin, <Q REND="inline">"that this <HI>Donatus,</HI> and another book entitled <HI>Con&s;e&s;&s;io|nalia</HI>
<PB N="50" REF="61">
were the fir&s;t printed books, and that <HI>John Fau&s;t</HI> citizen of <HI>Mentz,</HI> and fir&s;t inventor of the Art of Printing, had printed them <HI>ann.</HI> 1450,"</Q> as has been &s;aid in the la&s;t chapter.</P>
<P>FROM this account of <HI>Accur&s;ius</HI> it is plain: <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that this <HI>Donatus</HI> bore neither date nor name of place or printer, otherwi&s;e he need not to have been at the trouble of gue&s;&s;ing at them. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That <HI>Donatus</HI> is the name of the author, not of the book; and that it was only a grammar for boys, for &s;o <HI>Rocha</HI> calls it in the place before quoted; to which we may add, that in the la&s;t li&s;t which the fir&s;t Printers at <HI>Rome</HI> gave of their works to the Pope, they call it <HI>Donatus pro pueris;</HI> &s;o that it could not be &s;uch a trifling thing as &s;ome authors have thought it, who only call it a Primer. The <HI>third</HI> thing I would ob&s;erve from this pa&s;&s;age is, that <HI>John Fau&s;t,</HI> who is here call'd the fir&s;t inventor of printing, is affirm'd to have printed it at <HI>Mentz:</HI> but what has puzled the world is, what the &s;ame author adds at the end of the pa&s;&s;age, <HI>viz. that</HI> Fau&s;t <HI>did certainly take the hint from the</HI> Donatus <HI>in</HI> Holland, <HI>fir&s;t printed on Blocks of wood;</HI> which for that very rea&s;on, tho&s;e authors who have follow'd him, have thought fit to make 10 years older, and have &s;uppos'd them printed about the year 1440. I might indeed have omitted this pa&s;&s;age, &s;eeing <HI>Accur&s;ius</HI> &s;eems to hint that this book of his was printed by fu&s;ile types; but as it was the only one that has been &s;een by any author, and confirms &s;ome of our former a&s;&s;ertions, I thought it would not be ami&s;s to in&s;ert it, e&s;|pecially con&s;idering that it was not impo&s;&s;ible for <HI>Accur&s;ius</HI> to be mi&s;taken in his judgment, of its being printed after the new method of &s;eparate types, as many other learned men have been in the like ca&s;e. The merit of this quotation has been examin'd in the la&s;t chapter, and it is plain that all the authors that have mention'd the date of this book, &s;uch as <HI>Beughen, Boxhorn, Bertius,</HI> and others have taken it upon tru&s;t, as well as what they affirm of its being done upon wooden blocks, &s;ince none of them pre|tend either to have &s;een it, or to have taken it from any author that had: and if we &s;hould admit what <HI>Accur&s;ius</HI> affirms, that tho&s;e &s;uppos'd <HI>dutch ones</HI> were older than this he wrote upon, it will make it &s;till plainer that they had neither date, printer, nor place's name; &s;ince this, which is &s;up|pos'd ten years younger, is without any of them. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of the other books I am now going to give an account of, <HI>viz.</HI> the
<PB N="51" REF="62">
<HI>Speculum, Ars moriendi,</HI> &amp;c. which are in the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI>'s curious collection, none of which, tho' they &s;eem to be improvements of one another, has the lea&s;t mention of time, place, or printer.</P>
<P>However, as to their being engraven upon wooden blocks, and con|&s;equently being the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays, or as &s;ome antiquaries call them, the fir&s;t <HI>Maculatures</HI> of the art, I am fully convinc'd, both by the ink with which they are printed, <HI>viz.</HI> the common writing ink, and by &s;ome undoubted trials I have made of them. I &s;hall therefore lay down the following rules to di&s;tingui&s;h between books printed on blocks of wood and &s;epa|rate metal types.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Let an <HI>m, w,</HI> or any other remarkable letter, be curiou&s;ly ex|amin'd both as to its length, breadth and &s;hape, and compare it with the &s;ame letter in another word, if they vary either in &s;imilitude or &s;ize, you may be a&s;&s;ur'd they are not metal types, &s;ince the mo&s;t curious let|ter-cutter, writing-ma&s;ter, or engraver, cannot make any two letters &s;o alike, but a nice ob&s;erver will di&s;tingui&s;h one from the other: on the contrary, in &s;eparate metal types each letter being ca&s;t in the &s;ame ma|trice, it is impo&s;&s;ible there &s;hould be the lea&s;t difference either in &s;hape or &s;ize.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Another way is by choo&s;ing any word, the longer the bet|ter, take the length of it with the points of the compa&s;s, and compare it with the &s;ame word in another place, and if you find them both of the &s;ame length, you may depend upon their being printed with &s;eparate metal types; for as each letter is ca&s;t in the &s;ame mould, it is impo&s;&s;ible that their length &s;hould vary: but in writing and engraving there will be a vi&s;ible difference in the &s;ame word in various places.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Mea&s;ure the length of a page; tell the number of lines in a full one, and take the white &s;paces between each line, and by compa|ring them to any other full page in the book, if they are printed with metal types there can be no variation in any of the&s;e re&s;pects: whereas, if they were done in wood it would be as impo&s;&s;ible for them to agree in any one in&s;tance, as it would be to engrave or write any two pages wherein there &s;hould be no vi&s;ible variation in &s;ome one or more of the foremention'd particulars. It was by the&s;e methods that I di&s;tingui&s;h'd, in the <HI>&s;ive</HI> books in the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI>'s <HI>Library,</HI> what was done on wood, and what by &s;eparate metal types.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="63">
MELCHIOR ADAMUS, and after him the learned <HI>Malinkrot</HI> and &s;ome others, tell us of &s;eparate wooden types cut with a knife, which were us'd by the fir&s;t Printers, before the di&s;covery of ca&s;ting them into metal; but be&s;ides that this &s;eems incon&s;i&s;tent with the mo&s;t authentick te&s;timonies we have quoted hitherto concerning this invention: whoever con&s;iders the va&s;t time and trouble it would require to cut &s;uch a quantity of them as is nece&s;&s;ary to print any moderate work, the great difficulty of making them &s;tand exactly upright and even in line and body, how liable they would be to &s;plit, break, warp, &s;hrink and &s;well with continual wet|ting and the weight of the pre&s;s, with many more &s;uch like inconvenien|ces and difficulties, will ea&s;ily judge, not only of the ab&s;urdity of this no|tion, but al&s;o of the impo&s;&s;ibility of any of tho&s;e old books being prin|ted by any &s;uch types; &s;ince it is obvious to every eye, that no one &s;in|gle work could have come perfect out of their hands for the rea&s;ons above-mention'd.</P>
<P>BEFORE I di&s;mi&s;s this point, I mu&s;t not omit acquainting the Reader with a mi&s;take into which <HI>Chevillier</HI> has been unwarily drawn, even when he took the &s;ure&s;t method of coming at the truth, concerning one of the&s;e books in que&s;tion, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Speculum Salutis,</HI> he tells us, <HI>pag.</HI> 281 and 282 of his <HI>Origin of Printing,</HI> that having one of them in his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on, and having met with another in the library of the <HI>Cele&s;tin</HI> Monks at <HI>Paris,</HI> he had the curio&s;ity to have them examined by a Printer, a Foun|der, and an Engraver, who judg'd them to be printed with &s;eparate|metal-types; &s;o that tho&s;e who have read his book, have thought it a &s;ufficient ground to alter their opinion of their being done on wooden blocks. But this mi&s;take of <HI>Chevillier</HI>'s proceeded from his not examining the whole book, becau&s;e as I &s;hall &s;hew anon, there were many leaves &s;upply'd afterwards by &s;eparate metal types, one of which he had the misfortune to light upon, otherwi&s;e they mu&s;t have manife&s;tly &s;een the difference</P>

THIS is only a tran&s;lation of the <HI>Speculum Salutis</HI> into <HI>Flemi&s;h:</HI> it was upon this book that Dr. <HI>Junius</HI> and the other <HI>dutch</HI> writers, who have fol|lowed him, lay &s;o great a &s;tre&s;s; and upon who&s;e antiquity, preferable to all others, they ground their claim to the invention of printing in favour of <HI>Co&s;ter.</HI> However it is very plain that the <HI>Latin</HI> one is prior to this, and that <HI>this</HI> is only a tran&s;lation of <HI>that,</HI> becau&s;e the wooden cuts are the &s;ame in both, the latin explanations at the bottom are left untran&s;lated, and the cuts are printed with the &s;ame pale gum'd writing ink as in the <HI>Latin</HI> one, rather brown than black; whereas the body of this work is com|pos'd with &s;eparate metal types, and printed with an ink as remarkable for its blackne&s;s as any &s;ort &s;ince made u&s;e of: it has al&s;o in &s;everal places the &s;ame mark in the paper, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>heiffer's LABEL and horns,</HI> ac|knowledg'd by Mon&s;. <HI>Naud&eacute;</HI> to be the mark in <HI>Fau&s;t</HI>'s paper.

<P>THERE remain &s;till two points to be examin'd with relation to the <HI>Donatus;</HI> 1. whether it be the fir&s;t book printed with wooden planks; 2. whether it was done by <HI>L. Co&s;ter</HI> at <HI>Harlem.</HI> To the fir&s;t there is on|ly the te&s;timonies of <HI>Ulric Zel</HI> citizen of <HI>Cologn,</HI> who relates what was done almo&s;t fifty years ago, and of <HI>Mar. Accur&s;ius,</HI> who wrote in <HI>Italy</HI> what he heard was done at, a &s;till, greater di&s;tance from him. To the&s;e, who could not po&s;&s;ibly be acquainted with every circum&s;tance of this di&s;co|very, we may rea&s;onably oppo&s;e the authority of <HI>Trithemius;</HI> for he learn'd what he tells us, not from report and uncertain tradition, but from the mouth of <HI>Peter Schoeffer,</HI> who related nothing but what he was an eye|witne&s;s of, or rather particularly intere&s;ted in. Now <HI>Trithemius</HI> a&s;cribes the invention of wooden blocks to <HI>J. Fau&s;t;</HI> and a&s;&s;erts that the <HI>Catho|licon</HI> was the fir&s;t book (of any con&s;equence) printed in that manner; and that his next &s;tep was the more ingenious invention of &s;eparate me|tal types.</P>
<P>LET the world judge whether his te&s;timony be not far preferable to that of the two former. <HI>Scriverius</HI> indeed, and after him Mr. <HI>Beughen,</HI> affirm the <HI>Donatus</HI> to have been printed <HI>anno</HI> 1440; but give no rea&s;on for their fixing on that year rather than any other; and it is manife&s;t from what they &s;ay before, that they only proceed upon a &s;uppo&s;ition, that this method being di&s;covered about that time; this book (which is perhaps the lea&s;t con&s;iderable of tho&s;e which were printed then) might be one of the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays of it. However let the <HI>Catholicon,</HI> the <HI>Donatus</HI> or any other, be the fir&s;t book printed in <HI>Europe</HI> with wooden planks, yet there is no ground of boa&s;ting it to be the fir&s;t in the world; &s;ince the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> practis'd that way of Printing at lea&s;t 300 years before either <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> or <HI>Co&s;ter</HI> were born.</P>

THE next con&s;ideration is, where and by whom it was printed. The <HI>Dutch</HI> attempt two ways of proving it was done by <HI>Co&s;ter</HI> at <HI>Harlem:</HI> the fir&s;t is that of <HI>Junius,</HI> who pretends that it was one of the fir&s;t tryals of <HI>Co&s;ter</HI>'s metal types; but this has been &s;o fully confuted, that they have been oblig'd to recur to another &s;hift; which is, that <HI>Co&s;ter</HI> invented the engraven planks, and with the&s;e printed the <HI>Donatus</HI> and <HI>Speculum Salu|tis;</HI> and that from this <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> took the hint of inventing metal types, an improvement of the former method <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Alibi enim ars, alibi ornamenta artis in|venta; illa inter <HI>Hollandos,</HI> haec inter <HI>Germaniae Moguntinos.&mdash;Harlemum Tipographiae</HI> ve|lut matrem, <HI>Mogunt am</HI> autem nutricem fui&s;&s;e &amp; alumnam; ibi &s;uperatum quicquid in novae rei exordiis impeditum, hic additam majorem arti &s;peciem &amp; facilitatem. <HI>Boxhorn de Art.

<P>WITH re&s;pect to this chronicle and the writer of it, we only know what our author tells us in his tran&s;lation in&s;erted at the bottom of the page, for the chronicle is written in <HI>high dutch.</HI> As it wants therefore &s;ome better authority for its &s;upport, Dr. <HI>Mentel</HI> brings, as a confirmati|on of it, the te&s;timonies of the writers quoted in our third chapter, who make mention of <HI>Guttenberg</HI>'s carrying the art from <HI>Strasburgh</HI> to <HI>Mentz,</HI> where he perfected it by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>John Fau&s;t</HI> alias <HI>Gensfleich;</HI> who&s;e words are not therefore nece&s;&s;ary to be repeated here. In the next place he alledges an in&s;cription, which with <HI>Mentel</HI>'s coat of arms was put at the beginning of <HI>Otho Brunsfield</HI>'s <HI>Onoma&s;ticon</HI> printed at <HI>Strasburgh</HI> by <HI>John Schott anno</HI> 1543, importing <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">In&s;igne <HI>Schottorum</HI> familiae ab <HI>Frederico Romanorum</HI> III imperatore <HI>Jeanni Mentelin</HI> pri|mo Typographiae inventori, ac &s;uis conce&s;&s;um anno 1466. p. 104.</NOTE>, that the&s;e arms of <HI>Schott</HI>'s family had been given to <HI>John Mentelin,</HI> fir&s;t inventor of the art of Printing, and to his po&s;terity by the Emperor <HI>Frederic</HI> III. <HI>anno</HI> 1466.

<P>THE book, at the end of which are the&s;e ver&s;es, is the <HI>Epi&s;tles of</HI> Cra|tes <HI>the Cynick,</HI> printed by <HI>Martin Crantz</HI> and his two partners beforemen|tion'd <HI>anno</HI> 1470, not at <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> as our author would fain in&s;inuate to his readers, but at <HI>Paris;</HI> where it is &s;till extant in the library of the <HI>Sor|bon,</HI> and was &s;een among others by <HI>Chevillier,</HI> who has occa&s;ionally con|futed <HI>Mentel</HI>'s &s;uppo&s;ition, and expos'd his unfair quotation of the epi|gram, pag. 31. of his <HI>Hi&s;tory of Printing;</HI> as we &s;hall &s;hew in its proper place.</P>
<P>THIS is all that I can find in <HI>Mentel's</HI> book, which has the appear|ance of argument: the re&s;t con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in digre&s;&s;ions, and quotations in prai&s;e of the art, and of the <HI>German</HI> nation; which are entirely foreign

to this controver&s;y. In &s;hort our author &s;hews him&s;elf more de&s;irous of appearing zealous for his ance&s;tor's honour, than &s;olicitous what credit his work will merit among the learned: I &s;hall give an in&s;tance or two of this, and proceed to the confutation of his main arguments.</P>
<P>IN page 31, he gives us a piece of a comedy written by the famous <HI>Swe|di&s;h</HI> poet <HI>Nicodemus Fri&s;chlin;</HI> but is pleas'd to overlook the lines quoted by us before at p. 19, in which he affirms, <HI>John Fau&s;t</HI> citizen of <HI>Mentz</HI> to have been the inventor of the art; tho' they are at a very &s;mall di&s;tance from the pa&s;&s;age quoted by him; what is &s;till more remarkable is, that <HI>Mentel</HI> affirms that our <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> poet dedicated this dramatic piece to the &s;enate of <HI>Strasburgh;</HI> which he would &s;carce have done, had he dreamt any thing of that city's claiming the glory of this invention again&s;t his Hero <HI>John Fau&s;t,</HI> or heard any thing of the charge of theft alledg'd again&s;t him by the <HI>Strasburgers.</HI> The other in&s;tance of his unfairne&s;s is no le&s;s con&s;iderable at <HI>p.</HI> 67; where having &s;uppos'd that the <HI>Rationale Durandi</HI> was not printed 'till after the falling out of <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> and <HI>Guttenbergh,</HI> viz. <HI>ann.</HI> 1461, to evade the force of the real date 1459, he &s;ays with a very &s;erious air, that he had credible information from men of great learning, both Printers and others, that it was wrong printed, and that the figure I, which is put before, &s;hould have been after the X, that in|&s;tead of MCCCCLIX, it &s;hould have been MCCCCLXI: whereas Mr. <HI>Mattaire</HI> a&s;&s;ures us <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Vide quae&s;o <HI>Mentelii</HI> in opinione fal&s;a ob|&s;tinati, ip&s;iu&s;que hominum ornati&s;&s;imorum hal|lucinationem manife&s;tam; annus enim illius li|bri exprimitur non numeralibus litteris, &s;ed di&s;ertis verbis. <HI>Mille&s;ime quadringente&s;imo quinquage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">imo nono.

<PB N="63" REF="74">
latter was never printed in any book that could yet be produc'd. What is &s;aid will &s;uffice, I hope, to give an idea of this author's &s;incerity, who&s;e three principal authorities I &s;hall now examine.</P>
<P>FIRST, as to the <HI>Strasburgh</HI> chronicle, we may rea&s;onably be excus'd for not laying the &s;ame &s;tre&s;s upon it, that our author doth; &s;ince the ob&s;cu|rity of the writer, a &s;u&s;picion of his partiality for his country's honour|and a difficulty of believing a per&s;on in his own cau&s;e in oppo&s;ition to a great number of more credible witne&s;&s;es, are ob&s;tacles almo&s;t invin|cible. I am therefore inclin'd to think, that the bare oppo&s;ing of the chronicle of <HI>Cologne</HI> and <HI>Trithemius,</HI> who a&s;&s;ert that the art was fir&s;t brought from <HI>Mentz</HI> to <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> will be a &s;ufficient confutation of it, tho' there were no other authorities for the one, nor arguments again&s;t the other. However we have an unexceptionable witne&s;s to produce again&s;t this chronicle, <HI>viz.</HI> the learned <HI>Wimpheling,</HI> who was not only an eminent ci|tizen of <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> and almo&s;t contemporary with the di&s;covery of the art, but is likewi&s;e quoted by Dr. <HI>Mentel,</HI> tho' his te&s;timony be diametri|cally oppo&s;ite to his purpo&s;e: the fir&s;t part of the pa&s;&s;age is &s;et down at length in <HI>pag.</HI> 15, wherein he attributes the whole invention to <HI>John Gut|tenbergh;</HI> and tells us that he did not perfect it 'till he had been &s;ometime at <HI>Mentz;</HI> whil&s;t <HI>John Mentel</HI> undertaking the &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s, printed a great many volumes very neat and correct, and grew exceeding rich in a &s;hort time <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Interea <HI>Joannes Mentel</HI> id opi&s;icii genus incoeptans, multa volumina ca&s;tigate &amp; polite imprimendo factus e&s;t brevi opulenti&s;&s;imus. <HI>Wimphel loco <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">tat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI></NOTE>. This is all that <HI>Wimpheling</HI> &s;ays of <HI>Mentel;</HI> nor has any author, except that of this <HI>Strasburg</HI> chronicle, mention'd or &s;uppos'd him to be the inventor, but only one of the fir&s;t that practis'd that art at <HI>Stras|burgh:</HI> and if the reader will recollect what mo&s;t of the writers, quoted in the <HI>third</HI> chapter of this book, have &s;aid concerning <HI>Guttenbergh</HI>'s leav|ing <HI>Mentz</HI> and returning to <HI>Strasburg,</HI> where &s;ome of them affirm him to have taught <HI>Mentel</HI> the art; we &s;hall not wonder that <HI>Wimpheling</HI> makes him the fir&s;t inventor of it, &s;eeing he practis'd it there &s;ometime before it was known that <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> had done the like at <HI>Mentz;</HI> and was con&s;equently the fir&s;t Printer, that <HI>Wimpheling</HI> might know of: nor is it rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>Guttenbergh</HI> could have been weak enough to &s;ay any thing
<PB N="64" REF="75">
of what had pa&s;s'd at <HI>Mentz</HI> between <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> and him&s;elf, it being &s;o little to his credit.</P>
<P>MENTEL's next authority is taken from the coat of arms given to the family by the Emperor <HI>Frederick</HI> III; for which there is no other te&s;ti|mony but the fir&s;t leaf of the <HI>Onoma&s;ticon.</HI> However &s;uppo&s;ing it to be authentick, may we not with the greate&s;t rea&s;on oppo&s;e to it the patent or privilege granted by the Emperor <HI>Maximilian</HI> to <HI>John Schoeffer,</HI> in con|&s;ideration of his being the grand-&s;on of <HI>John Fau&s;t</HI> the fir&s;t inventor of the art of Printing? this privilege being of much later date than the other, may be rea&s;onably enough &s;uppos'd a retract<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tion of the former, which might have been &s;urreptitiou&s;ly obtain'd; e&s;pecially con&s;idering that <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> has the concurrent te&s;timonies of writers and inconte&s;table facts, but <HI>Mentel</HI> only brings an old chronicle and the mo&s;t precarious grounds to &s;upport his preten&s;ions. However the authentickne&s;s of this grant is not only much que&s;tion'd by the generality of writers, but has one ma|terial objection again&s;t it, which is, that the per&s;on to whom it was gi|ven, never made any mention or &s;hew of it in all the books printed by him at <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> which, according to <HI>Wimpheling</HI>'s account, were very numerous. It &s;eems to me &s;urprizing, that if he had really obtain'd &s;uch a noble te&s;timony of his being the fir&s;t inventor of Printing, and had been &s;o treacherou&s;ly robb'd both of the &s;ecret and the glory of it by a faith|le&s;s &s;ervant, he had not made u&s;e of his Imperial Maje&s;ty's authority (who&s;e &s;ubject he was as well as <HI>Fau&s;t,)</HI> to confirm the honour of the invention upon him&s;elf, and the &s;hame of the theft upon the other. But on the contrary, there is not one book to be met with, (tho' we may rea&s;onably think Dr. <HI>Mentel</HI> was not negligent in &s;uch a &s;earch,) that was printed by <HI>John Mentel</HI> before the year 1473, and even this was without any mention of the place where it was printed; as appears from the <HI>Speculum morale</HI> of <HI>Vincentius</HI> in folio, which is the olde&s;t book known to bear his name: whereas <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> and his &s;on-in-law put their names to their impre&s;&s;ions almo&s;t &s;ixteen years before that time, as is plain from the <HI>P&s;almorum Codex</HI> printed <HI>ann.</HI> 1457. What is &s;till more wonderful, is, that <HI>John Mentel</HI> never plac'd this coat of arms in any of his books as we can find; for the olde&s;t edition that hath it, is the <HI>Geographical work of Ptolemy</HI> printed by his nieces &s;on MDXX, that is, 70 years after the in|vention,
<PB N="65" REF="76">
64 years after the grant, and 63 after <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> had begun to print in his own name, even by <HI>Mentel</HI>'s own confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I come now to con&s;ider the epigram, and Dr. <HI>Mentel</HI>'s wild inferen|ces from it, (which he grounds upon a &s;uppo&s;ition, that the <HI>epi&s;tles,</HI> at the end of which it is printed, were done at <HI>Strasburgh,)</HI> from which he would conclude, that from this city, not only the three fir&s;t Printers of <HI>Paris,</HI> to whom they are in&s;crib'd, but al&s;o the mo&s;t celebrated ones of <HI>Europe</HI> came.

It is likewi&s;e probable enough, that they might not come all three from one and the &s;ame city, but perhaps each of them from a di&s;tinct one; in which ca&s;e the poet mu&s;t have been forc'd, either to name them all, or di&s;obliged one or two of them, or &s;poil a good epigram; and therefore rather cho&s;e to compliment them under the name of <HI>Germans</HI> without regard to the place of their birth.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. The Time of the Di&s;covery of <HI>Printing.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE difficulty of fixing the exact time of the di&s;covery ari&s;es from the&s;e two rea&s;ons: 1. Becau|s;e the inventors made many fruitle&s;s tryals, and a great number of maculatures, before they could bring the art to any tolerable degree of perfection: 2. Becau&s;e the va&s;t expences of &s;uch a di&s;covery oblig'd them to keep it &s;ecret as long as po&s;&s;ible, or at lea&s;t 'till they had reimburs'd them&s;elves in &s;ome mea&s;ure, by fini&s;hing the <HI>latin bible,</HI> which tho' a great and expen&s;ive work, was mo&s;t likely to compen&s;ate their pains and co&s;t when fini&s;h'd. This is the foundation of the di&s;agreement between writers upon the &s;ubject; which may how|ever
<PB N="68" REF="79">
be ea&s;ily reconcil'd by attending to the different epocha's, from which they date the di&s;covery. Some of them, as <HI>Wimpheling, Palmerus, Althamerus,</HI> &amp;c. date it from the infancy of the invention of wooden blocks, and a&s;&s;ign the year 1440. Others, as the author of the chronicle of <HI>Cologn, Trithemius, Aventine,</HI> and many more, from the invention of fu&s;ile types <HI>anno.</HI> 1450. <HI>Andrew Thevet, Angel Rocha,</HI> &amp;c. fix the di&s;co|very of the former method in 1442; whil&s;t others place the time of the &s;econd invention in 1453 or 1454, among whom are <HI>Apianus</HI> and <HI>P. Lan|gius.</HI> La&s;tly, <HI>Philip Bergomen&s;is</HI> and <HI>Peter Ramus</HI> a&s;&s;ign the year 1458 for the perfection of it. To accommodate this di&s;crepancy among all the&s;e authors, it will be &s;ufficient to &s;ay with relation to the fir&s;t, that they take their date from the time in which the invention of wooden blocks was perfected, rather than from its infancy: with re&s;pect to the la&s;t, that they thought a ten years interval much too &s;hort for the tran&s;ition from the infancy of the former to the perfection of the latter method, and therefore allow'd a few years more than their predece&s;&s;ors had done. As for tho&s;e who fix the latter invention in 1458, they were &s;uch as e&s;teem'd the fir&s;t printed book to have been the <HI>Catholicon</HI> printed <HI>ann.</HI> 1460, or perhaps the &s;econd impre&s;&s;ion of the <HI>bible ann.</HI> 1462, or <HI>Tully</HI>'s <HI>offices an.</HI> 1466, as <HI>Zwinger</HI> and others &s;uppos'd; and allow'd &s;ome years more for the invention and perfection of the art. Now 'tis plain that before the <HI>P&s;almorum Codex,</HI> as we have hinted, there is not any book known to have been printed with an <HI>imprimatur</HI> at the end; and it is equally certain, that the learned knew nothing of this la&s;t book 'till the year 1669, in which <HI>Peter Lambeck</HI> publi&s;h'd the &s;econd part of his catalogue of the <HI>imperial library,</HI> where this noble monument is pre&s;erv'd; which is the rea&s;on that it is omitted in all the li&s;ts of the fir&s;t printed books. 'Tis not &s;trange therefore that the&s;e writers, for want of dates and facts, &s;hould be oblig'd to gue&s;s, as well as they could, at the time of the di&s;covery. However we find that the chronicler of <HI>Cologn, Serrarius, Seba&s;t. Mun&s;ter,</HI> and others after them, well enough reconcile this diver&s;ity of opinions, by a&s;&s;ign|ing the year 1440 for the former invention, and 1450 for the latter. To the&s;e if we add the authority of <HI>Trithemius,</HI> who certainly had the be&s;t information in this matter, from <HI>Peter Schoeffer</HI> a principal per&s;on in the invention, it will be evident, that about the year 1440 they began to ap|ply
<PB N="69" REF="80">
them&s;elves to cutting or engraving upon wooden blocks, after the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> manner, and printed &s;ome books with them; but that after the year 1450 they found out a more excellent way, for the&s;e are <HI>Trithemi|us</HI>'s words in the famous pa&s;&s;age quoted in <HI>chap.</HI> 3 <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Po&s;t haec inventis &s;ucce&s;&s;erunt &s;ubtiliora, inveneruntque modum fundendi formas om|nium Latini alphabeti literarum, &amp;c.</NOTE>, <HI>viz.</HI> of ca&s;ting &s;e|parate metal types: this method they might have been devi&s;ing and try|ing before that time, <HI>i. e.</HI> during &s;ome part of the fir&s;t ten years; tho' they continued &s;till printing after the old way, 'till they had quite perfe|cted the new one; either to bring in a continual &s;upply of money ne|ce&s;&s;ary, or perhaps to keep the world from prying into the new di&s;co|very wherein they were engag'd.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid nothing hitherto of the <HI>dutch</HI> writers, who to make the time of this invention agree with <HI>Junius</HI>'s &s;tory of <HI>Fau&s;t</HI>'s pretended theft, have put it back, &s;ome above ten, others twenty years: how little credit they merit in this particular is already &s;hewn; and the reader will be &s;till more convinc'd of it, when he &s;ees what &s;hifts they are reduc'd to, for want of authorities to oppo&s;e to the va&s;t number of writers quoted on <HI>Fau&s;t</HI>'s &s;ide, not one of whom ever thought of fixing this remarka|ble epocha beyond the year 1440.</P>
<P>THEIR fir&s;t authority is the in&s;cription &s;et over <HI>Laurence Co&s;ter</HI>'s door by one of the citizens of <HI>Harlem,</HI> which is mention'd by all the <HI>dutch</HI> writers, and &s;ays that he found out this art <HI>ann.</HI> 1430: but this is of too recent a date to be of any weight.</P>
<P>SCRIVERIUS in his <HI>apology again&s;t Naud&eacute;</HI> makes the di&s;covery two years older, and gives us a <HI>Chronographic</HI> ver&s;e <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><P>hIC fago cX&s;C VI. ptas La VreatI CVs|plde for Mas.</P>

<P>BUT as the two former dates were affirm'd without any foundation, this author has endeavour'd to confirm his own with &s;omething, that might bear the appearance of authority; and to reconcile it with the other two, by affirming that <HI>Co&s;ter</HI> began to lay the foundation of this art <HI>ann.</HI> 1420, tho' he did not perfect it 'till ten years after.

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Of the fir&s;t books printed by <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> and <HI>Schoeffer.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THERE has been frequent occa&s;ion of mentioning the <HI>Catholicon,</HI> as the fir&s;t tryal of the art of Printing, according to <HI>Trithemius</HI>'s te|&s;timony; but as it is our de&s;ign to &s;peak of tho&s;e only, which are done with &s;eparate metal types, and bear &s;ome certain date or mark of the Printer; I &s;hall &s;u&s;pend the account of it, 'till I come to treat of its &s;e|cond impre&s;&s;ion by the &s;ame <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> and <HI>Schoeffer ann.</HI> 1460.</P>
<P>'T is certain that if only that book, which bears the olde&s;t date, is to be e&s;teem'd the fir&s;t printed; the <HI>book of p&s;alms</HI> &s;o often mention'd will bid the faire&s;t for the fir&s;t rank. Neverthele&s;s I can &s;ee no rea&s;on to de|part &s;o far from the te&s;timonies of <HI>Trithemius</HI> and the <HI>Chronicle</HI> of <HI>Cologn,</HI> as not to allow the preference to the <HI>Latin Bible,</HI> which, as they tell us, was the fir&s;t book, to which the pious authors of this art thought fit to con&s;ecrate their labours. In this opinion they have been follow'd by ma|ny learned and judicious writers both antient and modern; particularly <HI>Malincrot, Chevillier, de la Caille, Paul Pater</HI> and <HI>Wat&s;on.</HI> I &s;hall there|fore &s;elect the &s;tronge&s;t of their rea&s;ons, add a few remarks of my own upon them, and leave the deci&s;ion to the reader.</P>
<P>FIRST with re&s;pect to <HI>Trithemius</HI>'s te&s;timony; which, I think, is un|exceptionable, &s;eeing he affirms nothing but what he had from <HI>Peter Scho|effer</HI>'s mouth: He plainly enough intimates, that the <HI>Bible</HI> was their fir&s;t work, when he &s;ays that the art was found out by degrees: that after they had fini&s;h'd the di&s;covery in &s;peculation, and came to put it in pra|ctice, they were involv'd in many difficulties: that <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">A primo inventionis &s;uae, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> impre&s;&s;ari namque b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 letters">am. <HI>Trithem. loco &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ra citato.</HI></NOTE> <HI>&s;oon after or from the beginning of this invention, when they went about printing the Bible,</HI> before they had fini&s;h'd the third quaternion (or quire of four &s;heets,) the char|ges amounted already to four thou&s;and <HI>florins,</HI> a prodigious &s;um in tho&s;e days. If we duly con&s;ider the&s;e words, we cannot but conclude the <HI>Bi+ble</HI>
<PB N="72" REF="83">
to have been the fir&s;t book they engaged in. Our author indeed men|tions not the year in which it was printed; but this might proceed from forgetfulne&s;s or want of information. However &s;ince &s;uch a work could not be fini&s;h'd in a &s;hort time, when the art was in its infancy, the hands but few and unacquainted with the &s;everal branches of compo&s;ition, im|po&s;ition, correction, di&s;tribution, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> we may &s;uppo&s;e the invention to have been perfected in &s;peculation about the year 1450, and yet to have required &s;ome time before it could be put in practice, by rea&s;on of the difficulties ari&s;ing in it; &s;o that it will be rea&s;onable to allow a year or two more, before the impre&s;&s;ion of the <HI>bible</HI> could be compleated. This may in all probability be the rea&s;on why <HI>Trithemius,</HI> who is always ve|ry exact in his <HI>chronicles,</HI> and mentions the year of any fact, when he is &s;ure of it, rather choo&s;es to make u&s;e of a more general expre&s;&s;ion in this ca&s;e, <HI>viz. his temporibus</HI> about this time, when he &s;peaks of the year 1450: if we recollect that he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in the &s;ame words in his fir&s;t <HI>Chro|nicle,</HI> we &s;hall be oblig'd either to allow a larger &s;cope to them; or el&s;e &s;uppo&s;e that the <HI>Catholicon,</HI> which was done in wood, and the <HI>Bible</HI> printed with metal types, were fini&s;h'd at the &s;ame time, which would be ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Manu&s;cript Cologn Chronicle</HI> tells us, that it was printed in the <HI>Ju|bile</HI> year 1450, in a large character, &s;uch as is us'd in the impre&s;&s;ions of <HI>Mi&s;&s;als</HI> or <HI>Ma&s;s books,</HI> which an&s;wers to our <HI>Double Pica.</HI> This <HI>Chro|nicle</HI> was written in <HI>high dutch ann.</HI> 1499; the author of which acquaints us, that he had the particulars of this invention from <HI>Ulric Zel,</HI> an old book&s;eller then living at <HI>Cologn.</HI> As the original is not &s;o well under&s;tood here, I &s;hall &s;ubjoin at the bottom of the page, the whole pa&s;&s;age in la|tin, as I find it tran&s;lated by <HI>Malinkrot</HI> <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Ars primum inventa in <HI>Germaniae</HI> urbe <HI>Mo|guntina</HI> ad <HI>Rhenum</HI> circa annum 1440; &amp; ab eo donec &s;criberetur 14<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">0, inventioni ejus corum|que quae ad illam pertinent, opera impen&s;a fuit; eoque anno, qui <HI>Jubilaeus</HI> fuit, coeptum fuit pri|mim libros imprimere; primu&s;que qui excu|deretur liber <HI>Liblta</HI> fuere <HI>Latina,</HI> impre&s;&s;aque ea &s;unt &s;criptura grandiori, quali hodie <HI>M&s;&s;ilia</HI> imprimi &s;olent.&mdash;initium &amp; progre&s;&s;um me|morati arti&s;icii ex honorabilis magi&s;tri <HI>Ulric Zel Hanovien&s;is</HI> narrantis ore cognovi, qui etiam nunc hoc anno 14<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">9 <HI>Coloniae</HI> Typographum agit. <HI>V. d.

However, tho' we cannot be certain either from him, or <HI>Trithemius,</HI> when this noble work was perfe|cted; yet it is manife&s;t from their re&s;timony, that, except &s;ome macula|tures and &s;mall tryals, the <HI>Bible</HI> was the fir&s;t con&s;iderable piece printed by <HI>Fau&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>I am not ignorant that Mr. <HI>Mattaire</HI> in his <HI>Annals</HI> has declar'd him&s;elf of the contrary opinion; but as he has not confuted any of the above-mention'd te&s;timonies, tho' he mu&s;t have read them in the authors before quoted, nor given any rea&s;on for his departing from them; I have gi|ven preference to the judgment of &s;o many learned writers confirm'd by two &s;uch con&s;iderable te&s;timonies, to his &s;ingle opinion. I apprehend but two tolerable objections again&s;t this; the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> is, that not one of the&s;e <HI>bibles</HI> is known to be extant: The <HI>&s;econd</HI> is, that <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> cannot pro|bably be &s;uppos'd to have begun with &s;o large and expen&s;ive a volume, when a &s;maller would have been more proper for an e&s;&s;ay, and brought him a more &s;peedy gain. To the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> I an&s;wer, 1. That this <HI>bible</HI> be|ing &s;o full of abbreviations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in imitation of the old way of writing, and difficult to be read, might undergo the &s;ame fate with many other books both MS. and others, to be thrown by and de&s;troy'd, when the fairer and more legible impre&s;&s;ions came in vogue: 2. The learned <HI>Sau|bert</HI> in his <HI>Oration de Bibliotheca Reipublicae Noribergen&s;is</HI> tells us, that he had &s;een no le&s;s than eight copies of them in the <HI>Norican</HI> library, without date, colophon, or any other mark of their being printed by <HI>Fau&s;t.</HI> As I have not been able to procure <HI>Saubert</HI>'s book, I mu&s;t content my &s;elf with giving the reader the pa&s;&s;age out of <HI>Paul Pater,</HI> in which this is mention'd: it is as follows, <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><HI>Biblia Latina,</HI> quorum tran&s;latio <HI>Divo Hi|eronymo</HI> vulgo tribuitur, circa 1450 &amp; &s;equen|tem <HI>Moguntiae</HI> in membrana impre&s;&s;a, quorum <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> exemplar nummis uncialibus &s;eu thale|ris &s;eptingentis quinquaginta <HI>Pari&s;us</HI> venum de|derat, ut &s;upra ex <HI>Abbate Spanhemen&s;i</HI> narravi|mus, inter primordia merito numerari <HI>Corneli|us Beughen</HI> memorat <HI>(Iocunab.

Am&s;terd. ann.</HI> 1688.) <HI>Henry Salmuth</HI> likewi&s;e mentions ano|ther Bible publi&s;h'd <HI>ann.</HI> 1459, at the end of which are the&s;e words; <HI>This pre&s;ent Rationale,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>was fini&s;h'd at</HI> Mentz <HI>by</HI> John Fau&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but <HI>Salmuth</HI> is doubtle&s;s mi&s;taken in taking this book for the Bible, of which it was only a &s;hort explanation. A copy of this <HI>Bern. Malin|krot</HI> tells us that he had by him. I would not however be too po|&s;itive that there was not a <HI>Latin Bible</HI> printed in the &s;ame year, &s;ee|ing <HI>John Saubert</HI> owns that he had &s;een eight copies of it in the <HI>Nori|can</HI> library, without <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI>'s colophon, undoubtedly for the rea&s;on beforemention'd, <HI>(viz.</HI> in order to &s;ell 'em for Manu&s;cripts.)"</Q> From this pa&s;&s;age it appears, that there are eight bibles without <HI>Fau&s;t</HI>'s mark pre&s;erv'd in that library, and &s;een by <HI>Saubert;</HI> tho' both he and <HI>P. Pa|ter</HI> took them for the &s;econd impre&s;&s;ion, in which they are certainly mi|&s;taken: 1. Becau&s;e this was printed <HI>ann.</HI> 1462, and not <HI>ann.</HI> 1459: 2. Be|cau&s;e it is &s;o far from having been printed without a <HI>colophon,</HI> that it has one of the fulle&s;t and plaine&s;t that <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> ever us'd at the end of any of his books: the reader will &s;ee it, when we come to the edition it&s;elf. But 3. 'tis not impo&s;&s;ible but that there may be &s;till more of the&s;e copies in &s;ome other libraries, as yet undi&s;cover'd. The only intelligence which we had concerning the&s;e eight, is owing to <HI>Saubert;</HI> neither would the&s;e gentlemen have believ'd that there had been a <HI>P&s;almorum Codex</HI> printed at <HI>Mentz ann.</HI> 1457, tho' a&s;&s;ur'd of it by <HI>Trithemius</HI> and <HI>Zel,</HI> had not <HI>Pe|ter Lambeck</HI> the Emperor's library-keeper 28 years ago told us, that he
<PB N="75" REF="86">
met with it in that famous library. I have been likewi&s;e a&s;&s;ur'd from the mouth of a gentleman of credit, that a friend of his had &s;een one abroad with the date of 1457, and farther that 'twas his opinion 'twould be brought to <HI>England.</HI> How many authors have had a notion that <HI>Tully</HI>'s <HI>Offices</HI> was the fir&s;t printed book? yet time has produc'd no le&s;s than four printed before it, exclu&s;ive of the <HI>bible</HI> now in que&s;tion; and may yet di&s;cover more concerning this.</P>
<P>I come now to the <HI>&s;econd</HI> objection &s;o much in&s;i&s;ted upon by &s;ome; <HI>viz.</HI> that 'tis improbable <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> would begin his fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays with a volume &s;o large and expen&s;ive, when a &s;maller would have an&s;wer'd his purpo&s;e much better, and brought an immediate gain. My reply is, 1. That the great expence at fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ted in purcha&s;ing &s;uch a quantity of materials as the bu&s;ine&s;s requir'd, and not in printing of the fir&s;t book, which was incon&s;iderable compar'd with that; con&s;equently a &s;maller volume would have been too &s;lender a reimbur&s;ement for &s;uch great &s;ums expended: Be&s;ides we have &s;hewn that they took up money of <HI>Guttenbergh</HI> for buy|ing of parchment, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and were not &s;o &s;traitned as before. 2. As <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> de&s;ign'd to &s;ell as many of his fir&s;t printed books as he could for manu|&s;cripts, in order to make up the co&s;t which he had been at; 'tis obvi|ous that he mu&s;t pitch upon &s;ome con&s;iderable and valuable book, before his art was di&s;cover'd, and where could he fix upon one more adapted to his purpo&s;e than this? I will not in&s;i&s;t upon the piety of the per&s;ons &s;o con&s;picuous in all their in&s;criptions, (tho' our age may call it &s;uper|&s;tition,) which might have a great &s;hare in determining their choice. I &s;hall only add, that as it was by no means advi&s;eable for him to &s;ell any of his fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays, left they &s;hould betray his invention; &s;o it was mo&s;t prudent to make them upon the fir&s;t leaves of the Bible, which if they &s;ucceeded, would in time make him ample amends; and if they did not, the lo&s;s was no greater than if they had been try'd upon a <HI>Donatus</HI> or a <HI>Primer.</HI> Be&s;ides none of our authors have affirm'd that he began to print the <HI>bible</HI> before he had perfected the art both in theory and practice; and made a &s;ufficient number of maculatures and other tryals, which it was the mo&s;t prudent way to burn as &s;oon as printed off. I &s;hall leave this di&s;cour&s;e of the fir&s;t <HI>bible</HI> to the reader's choice, either to clo&s;e in with, or di&s;&s;ent from us in allowing it the fir&s;t rank; and proceed now to the
<PB N="76" REF="87">
remainder of our propos'd li&s;t. It will be nece&s;&s;ary however to acquaint him, altho' we have given the preference to that &s;acred book upon the te&s;timonies of &s;o many antient and modern writers, tho' it bears no date, yet in the following li&s;t I am about to give him of the&s;e fir&s;t impre&s;|&s;ions of <HI>Fau&s;t,</HI> we chiefly inquire after &s;uch as carry either date or &s;ome other certain mark of the year in which they were printed: for as to tho&s;e that do not, I &s;hall &s;peak of them afterwards, and &s;hew that tho&s;e authors who thought to have found out their date, have prov'd to have been in an error; which will be a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for us not to depend upon any others of the like nature.</P>
<P>NEXT to the <HI>Bible</HI> we find <HI>five</HI> &s;everal impre&s;&s;ions, which have certainly been made between the years 1457 and 1466. The fir&s;t of the&s;e, which as we hinted, is omitted in all the li&s;ts of the fir&s;t books that have been printed before <HI>Lambeck</HI>'s catalogue of the <HI>Vienna</HI> library, is the <HI>P&s;almo|rum Codex</HI> printed at <HI>Mentz</HI> upon Vellum <HI>anno</HI> 1457; concerning this, what has been &s;aid already will &s;uffice, the colophon of it is in the <HI>fourth</HI> chapter, p. 29.</P>
<P>THE <HI>&s;econd</HI> is the <HI>Rationale Divinorum Officiorum,</HI> written by <HI>William Durand,</HI> printed at <HI>Mentz</HI> upon Vellum two Years after the <HI>P&s;alter,</HI> viz. <HI>anno</HI> 1459 by <HI>John Fau&s;t</HI> and <HI>Peter de Gern&s;heim</HI> or <HI>Schoeffer; Malinkrot,</HI> who knew nothing of the <HI>P&s;alter,</HI> reckons it the fir&s;t printed Book next to the <HI>Bible;</HI> and tells us that he purchas'd one of them, which had for|merly belong'd to a Mona&s;tery of <HI>Franci&s;can</HI> Monks, de&s;troy'd by the civil Wars, the in&s;cription of which is very near the &s;ame with that of the <HI>P&s;alter.</HI> This <HI>Rationale</HI> is likewi&s;e in the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI>'s Library, where I &s;aw it; it is beautifully printed in Folio, upon Vellum, and is a &s;ingular Beauty as to Pre&s;s-work.</P>
<P>THE Suppo&s;ition of <HI>Malinkrot</HI> and others that this was the fir&s;t print|ed Book, was the rea&s;on that <HI>Father L'Abb&eacute;</HI> a learned <HI>Je&s;uit</HI> began his Li&s;t of printed Books from the Years of its date, <HI>viz.</HI> 1459 to 1500. and the author of the Supplement to <HI>Bellarmin</HI>'s <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> Writers makes this remark upon it, That <HI>Anno</HI> 1459, <HI>John Fau&s;tus</HI> having di&s;|covered the art of Printing, fir&s;t printed the Book of <HI>Guill. Durand de Officiis Eccle&s;ia&s;ticis</HI> in the city of <HI>Mentz.</HI> The&s;e authors were certainly
<PB N="77" REF="88">
in the right, &s;eeing no book was then known of an older date: but &s;ince the &s;econd part of <HI>Trithemius</HI>'s <HI>Chronicle,</HI> and the &s;econd volume of the <HI>Imperial-library</HI> have been publi&s;h'd, we mu&s;t look &s;ome years back for the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion, and give that rank to a more noble work.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Third</HI> is the <HI>Catholicon,</HI> a <HI>Latin</HI> vocabulary, printed at <HI>Mentz anno</HI> 1460. the &s;econd time; for the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion was done upon wood. This Book is likewi&s;e in the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI>'s library, where I &s;aw it, it is in a large folio, and beautifully printed. We have given the in|&s;cription of it in the fourth <HI>chap.</HI> p. 30, in which tho' the printer's name is not expre&s;s'd, yet it was done by <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> and <HI>Schoeffer,</HI> both from the &s;imilitude of its character, paper, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with that of their other works, and becau&s;e there were at that time no other printers either at <HI>Mentz</HI> or any where el&s;e. This <HI>Catholicon</HI> is a kind of <HI>Grammar,</HI> compil'd by <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Genoa</HI> a <HI>Dominican Fryar anno</HI> 1286. It is divided into four parts, the la&s;t of which contains a dictionary of <HI>Latin</HI> words dige&s;ted alphabetically. There have been &s;everal editions of it in <HI>folio,</HI> as <HI>Che|villier</HI> tells us, who &s;aw two of them; one, very old and without date; the other printed at <HI>Paris anno</HI> 1506. by <HI>Jodocus Badius.</HI> Another im|pre&s;&s;ion of it is done at <HI>Lyons</HI> by <HI>Antony Du Ry anno</HI> 1520, and aug|mented by <HI>Peter Gille. Furetiere</HI> therefore was led into a palpable er|ror, when he affirm'd after <HI>Dr. Mentel</HI> and <HI>Father Jacob a Carmelite,</HI> that the fir&s;t printed books known in <HI>Europe</HI> were <HI>Durandus de Ritibus Ec|cle&s;iae</HI> printed <HI>anno</HI> 1461, a bible printed <HI>anno</HI> 1462, <HI>St. Au&s;tin de Civi|tate Dei,</HI> and <HI>Tully</HI>'s <HI>Offices;</HI> &s;eeing here are no le&s;s than four printed books before the olde&s;t of them; be&s;ides this book <HI>de Ritibus Eccle&s;iae</HI> was not written by <HI>William Durand,</HI> but by <HI>John Stephen Durant,</HI> who was fir&s;t pre&s;ident of the parliament of <HI>Tholou&s;e,</HI> and is therefore a dif|ferent book from the <HI>Durand</HI>'s <HI>Rationale</HI> we are now &s;peaking of, and of a much later date.</P>
<P>THE <HI>fourth</HI> is the &s;econd edition of the <HI>Latin Bible</HI> printed <HI>anno</HI> 1462. in <HI>folio</HI> with the following in&s;cription at the end <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Pre&s;ens hoc opus finitum ac completum &amp; ad eu&s;ebiam Dei indu&s;tria in civitate <HI>Mogun|tin&agrave;</HI> per <HI>Johannem Fu&s;t</HI> civem &amp; <HI>retrum Sho|efer de Gern&s;heim</HI> clericum Dioece&s;is eju&s;dem e&s;t con&s;ummatum anno incarnationis Dominicae MCCCCLX.

Of this bible <HI>Walchius</HI> <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><HI>Walchius decas fabularum generis humani printed at Strasburgh</HI> 1609 <HI>in 4to. pag.</HI> 181</NOTE> relates a &s;tory, which ought to be mention'd here, as far as re&s;pects the common opinion. <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> went to <HI>Paris</HI> with &s;ome copies of it finely illuminated, where he &s;old one of them for 750 crowns, and another for 500; till at length he reduc'd his price to 50 and 40 crowns. The great quan|tity which he &s;old, and the exact likene&s;s of every copy, made it &s;u&s;|picious that they were done by a more ea&s;y and expeditious way than that of writing; whereupon the buyers thinking them&s;elves impos'd upon, began a pro&s;ecution which oblig'd him to fly the country, and return to <HI>Mentz.</HI> Thus far <HI>Walchius,</HI> who &s;ays nothing of <HI>Fau&s;t</HI>'s being accus'd of magick, as &s;ome others affirm. What relates to the per&s;on of <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> will be be&s;t con&s;ider'd in the next chapter. As to the <HI>bible</HI> it&s;elf, 'tis my opinion, that the rea&s;on why the generality of authors have thought this &s;econd edition to have been that which he &s;old for MS. is, that they &s;carce knew of any other book printed before it <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr. Le Gallois</HI> in his treati&s;e of the fine&s;t libraries pag. 16<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">. tells us that there was no|thing printed before this bible of 1462, which <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> brought to <HI>Paris.

end: but this is improbable upon two accounts; fir&s;t, he had already printed three books with in&s;criptions, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>P&s;alter,</HI> the <HI>Rationale,</HI> and the <HI>Catholicon;</HI> all which import particularly <HI>that they were not done with pen and ink or any writing tool, but by a fine new invented art of ca&s;ting Letters, and printing with them.</HI> Now &s;ince &s;ome of the&s;e mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;i|ty have been known in <HI>France</HI> long before this year; it was impo&s;&s;ible to have deceiv'd them by any but the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion, unle&s;s we did &s;up|po&s;e that he kept the three former un&s;old and un&s;een; which would be mo&s;t ab&s;urd to imagine. But &s;econdly 'tis plain that his de&s;ign in &s;el|ling them for MSS. was to reimbur&s;e him&s;elf for the va&s;t charges which he had been at in devi&s;ing this invention, preparing all the nece&s;&s;ary materials, making e&s;&s;ays, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Such expences mu&s;t have reduc'd him a|bove twelve years before this to the nece&s;&s;ity of a recruit, &s;eeing he had perfected the new invention, and began to print with it on or &s;oon after the year 1450. as has been fully prov'd; nor can we in any probability &s;uppo&s;e that he &s;hould work on for twelve whole years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively and print three editions, two of which were very large, without vending them; e&s;pecially &s;ince he is reported by mo&s;t authors to have enrich'd him&s;elf exceedingly by this time, and con&s;equently wanted no &s;uch &s;tra|tegem? If I could have obtain'd with all my endeavours any certain in|formation of the year in which he went to <HI>Paris,</HI> it would have deter|mined the di&s;pute. However, if I may be allow'd a conjecture, &s;ince we find by the unanimous con&s;ent of writers that the art was perfected in the year 1450, and no books printed in his name till <HI>anno</HI> 1457 as yet known: <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> might mo&s;t probably &s;pend the&s;e &s;even years in Printing, illuminating and &s;elling his fir&s;t <HI>Bible;</HI> after which, his new art being di&s;cover'd, he thought it in vain to keep it &s;ecret longer; and therefore in his next book gave the world an account of his method, as we find in the <HI>P&s;almorum Codex</HI> and tho&s;e that follow'd it. What confirms my conjecture is, that <HI>Guttenburgh,</HI> who was pro&s;ecuted by <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> for the moiety of the money expended, and gave a deed bearing date 1455 for the pay|ment, pur&s;uant to the judge's determination, in&s;tead of complying with it, e&s;cap'd to <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> and left his partner in the lurch, this we may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, reduc'd <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> to &s;uch &s;treights, as oblig'd him to go to <HI>Paris</HI> with what books he had, in order to &s;ell them to the be&s;t ad|vantage.
<PB N="80" REF="91">
The&s;e rea&s;ons induce me to think that it was the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> and not the <HI>&s;econd bible,</HI> which <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> &s;old at &s;uch extraordinary rates: The reader is at his liberty to judge as he plea&s;es in this matter.</P>

Mr. <HI>Mattaire</HI> adds, that the characters of it are very rude and ill &s;hap'd and &s;o full of abbreviations, that they are as difficult to read, as tho&s;e printed at <HI>Mentz ann.</HI> 1459 and 1460.</P>
<P>THIS makes it abundantly plain, that tho' the book carries the above-mention'd date, yet it bears te&s;timony that the compiling and not the printing of it, is there intended; &s;o that not only the difficulty di&s;ap|pears, but <HI>Chevillier's</HI> conjecture is manife&s;tly &s;upported: And Mr. <HI>Mat|taire</HI> &s;eems entirely of this opinion, and be&s;ides in&s;tances in a book or two which he hath, who&s;e dates as he a&s;&s;ures us, were tho&s;e of their being com|pil'd; tho' the ob&s;curity of their in&s;cription, might po&s;&s;ibly lead an unwary reader to take it for that of its impre&s;&s;ion: and indeed it is an unrea&s;onable &s;uppo&s;ition, that Printing could have been brought to &s;uch a degree of per|fection at that time, again&s;t the general te&s;timony of writers: be&s;ides nei|ther the abbreviations, nor the rudene&s;s of the character, can be a &s;uffici|ent index of their antiquity, &s;eeing, as he ob&s;erves, they continued in u&s;e among &s;ome eminent Printers even beyond the year 1500. In the next place I &s;hall mention &s;ome editions, who&s;e dates are certainly prov'd to be wrong. The fir&s;t is the <HI>Regula Pa&s;toris</HI> of Pope <HI>Gregory;</HI> a copy of which is in the <HI>French</HI> king's library, with this in&s;cription &s;uppos'd to be written at the end; <HI>Tentamentum Fau&s;ti,</HI> an e&s;&s;ay of <HI>John Fau&s;t ann.</HI> 1459: now it is plain from what has been &s;aid before that <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> was &s;o far from making any e&s;&s;ays at that time, that he had already printed &s;eve|ral perfect editions, Mr. <HI>Mattaire</HI> gives us this account of it <HI>p.</HI> 22. that he met with a book in <HI>4to</HI> in the king's library at <HI>Paris,</HI> without the name of either place or Printer, only with this title, <HI>Liber Regulae pa&s;to|ralis</HI> Gregorii <HI>papae ad</HI> Johannem <HI>epi&s;copum</HI> Ravenen&s;em: at the begin|ning of which <HI>Gabriel Naud&eacute;</HI> had written two ver&s;es to the reader with his own hand, intimating that book to have been certainly printed by <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> at <HI>Mentz,</HI> becau&s;e the mark of the paper which is the head and horns of
<PB N="84" REF="95">
an heifer, is an infallible criterium of <HI>Fau&s;t</HI>'s books. And an adverti&s;e|ment in which he confirms his a&s;&s;ertion, from the rudene&s;s of the types, the want of diphthongs, and &s;ome other circum&s;tances that favour the infancy of the art; and concludes, that <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> would not put his name, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to it, 'till his frequent e&s;&s;ays had embolden'd him to make him&s;elf publick, as he did afterwards in the <HI>Durand</HI>'s <HI>Rationale</HI> of 1459, <HI>Catho|licon,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Mattaire</HI> doth indeed prove plainly enough, that the rudene&s;s of the types, and want of dates, names, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> continued &s;ome con&s;iderable time after the di&s;covery of the art, and con&s;equently that that could be no certain mark of its being one of <HI>Fau&s;t</HI>'s fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays: however as no|thing certain can be affirm'd concerning this book, we &s;hall dwell no lon|ger upon it. I have &s;een <HI>Aeneas Sylvius's</HI> letters printed by <HI>Koelhoff</HI> of <HI>Lubeck,</HI> which is certainly antedated, for this rea&s;on, &s;everal dates in the letters being ten years older than the date of the book it&s;elf.

Koelhoff <HI>de</HI> Lubeck <HI>colonien&s;em civem impre&s;&s;i an.</HI> MCCCC, <HI>feliciter finiunt:</HI> for 'tis plain the art was not &s;o much as thought of at that time, nor perfected 'till 50 years after: but what demon&s;trates the fal&s;ene&s;s of the date is, that this <HI>John Koelhoff</HI> was &s;carce born then, &s;ince he printed the works of <HI>N. Ger&s;on</HI> in 4 <HI>vol.</HI> in <HI>fol.</HI> at <HI>Cologn ann.</HI> 1483, which are of the &s;ame make and character as the <HI>Flores</HI> abovemention'd, as <HI>Chevillier p.</HI> 10 and 11 ob&s;erves, who therefore thinks that the following numbers LXXXII were omitted at the end of MCCCC. The &s;ame author mentions two or three editions more of the &s;ame nature, the la&s;t of which is the <HI>Manipulus Cu|ratorum</HI> of <HI>Guy Mout Rocher</HI> with the following uncommon date at the end <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Completus <HI>Pari&s;iis</HI> anno Domini mille&s;imo CCCC vice&s;imo tertio, amen. <HI>Chevil.</HI> p. 11.</NOTE> <HI>Printed at</HI> Paris <HI>in the year one thou&s;and</HI> CCCC <HI>and twenty three, amen:</HI> 'tis plain that the art was not brought to <HI>Paris</HI> 'till the year 1470, as &s;hall be &s;hown in its place; &s;o that the la&s;t C mu&s;t have been taken up by the balls, or lo&s;t &s;ome other way.

&s;ubject.

<HEAD>CHAP. X. Remarkable Occurrences between the year 1450, and the Divulgation of the <HI>Art.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THO' I propos'd to avoid all unnece&s;&s;ary repetitions, yet this chap|ter being de&s;ign'd as a &s;hort recapitulation of the hi&s;tory of the fir&s;t <HI>twelve</HI> years, the thread of which has been unavoidably interrupted by controver&s;y; and to introduce &s;ome material occurrences, which could not properly be in&s;erted in any other chapter, or &s;uch as may have e&s;cap'd the readers memory; I find the impo&s;&s;ibility of joyning the&s;e notable events together, without inter&s;per&s;ing them with mo&s;t of tho&s;e already touched upon: and this has render'd an apology before hand highly ne|ce&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>I begin with the year 1450, in which 'tis agreed by mo&s;t authors, that the art was perfected in theory and practice, the inventors having prepar'd their tools and materials, and made a great number of e&s;&s;ays; thinking they might with &s;afety attempt &s;ome con&s;iderable volume: Their next care was to carry on the bu&s;ine&s;s without danger of being di&s;cover'd: to this end they admitted as few &s;ervants as po&s;&s;ible into any part of the &s;e|cret,
<PB N="86" REF="97">
and &s;uch only upon who&s;e &s;idelity they might depend, engaging them to the greate&s;t &s;ecrecy by an oath. This being done they allotted to them their &s;everal provinces; but conceal'd every branch of Letter|founding and compo&s;ing. If my authority be required, &s;ince all our accounts relating to the&s;e beginnings are &s;o ob&s;cure and imperfect; I an&s;wer, that this may rea&s;onably be infer'd from a remarkable pa&s;&s;age out of the learned <HI>Hen. Pantaleon,</HI> a phy&s;ician of <HI>Ba&s;il,</HI> part of which I have already quoted in a former chapter, as far as it related to <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> and <HI>Schoeffer</HI>'s being the authors of this art; the remainder of it is as fol|lows <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Erat enim ars illa primo ab&s;condita &amp; pau|culis manife&s;tata; litteras enim in &s;acculis clau|&s;is &s;ecum in Officinae ferebant, ac dum abeunt, auferebant; donec temporis &s;ucce&s;&s;u ars aucta atque plurimum illu&s;trata fuit. <HI>Do illu&s;tribus German.</HI> part. 2. pag. 397.</NOTE>: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This art was at the fir&s;t kept very &s;ecret and communicated to but very few; for they <HI>(Fau&s;t</HI> and <HI>Schoeffer)</HI> tyed up the types in bags, which they brought into the work-room, and took away when they went out, 'till at length in proce&s;s of time the bu&s;ine&s;s increa&s;ing caus'd the Art to be divulg'd."</Q> All the authors quoted by us agree with <HI>Pantaleon</HI> about their keeping the Art with all imaginable &s;ecrecy, but &s;carce any have inform'd us of this circum&s;tance, of their carrying their types with them to and out of the work-room; which would have been a vain precaution, had they intru&s;ted any but them&s;elves in the compo&s;i|tor's part. However it is evident that the whole &s;ecret did not con&s;i&s;t therein; the cutting the Punches, &s;inking them into the Matrices, ma|king the Moulds and ca&s;ting the Letters, might be &s;till a &s;ecret to any one that had been intru&s;ted &s;o far as to go through all the branches of the bu&s;ine&s;s of Printing; and he mu&s;t have been a per&s;on of a &s;urprizing ge|nius who could have found out the my&s;tery of Letter-founding by bare|ly &s;eeing the letters, therefore the keeping that part to them&s;elves was making it a greater &s;ecret than all the oaths they could bind them with.</P>
<P>THE next remarkable occurrence is that of their admitting <HI>John Gut|tenbergh</HI> a wealthy gold&s;mith into partner&s;hip with them, as it is related by the la&s;t nam'd author, by <HI>Salmuth,</HI> and others quoted in the <HI>third</HI> chap|ter. This gentleman finding his neighbour <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> engag'd in a new and advantagious invention, which he wanted money to carry on, and attra|cted
<PB N="87" REF="98">
by a pro&s;pect of gain, offer'd his pur&s;e and a&s;&s;i&s;tance upon good terms to <HI>Fau&s;t;</HI> who gladly accepted the propo&s;al. But <HI>Guttenbergh</HI> pur|&s;uing his own private rather than the common intere&s;t, and having at|tain'd &s;ome in&s;ight into the art, began to object that <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> had conver|ted &s;ome of the money to his own u&s;es, and refus'd the payment of his dividend of the charges; 'till <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> had obtain'd a decree, which oblig'd him to pay his moiety of what the plaintiff &s;hould &s;wear had been expen|ded upon the common fund: this he evaded by giving a bond payable &s;ome time after, and e&s;caping to <HI>Strasburgh</HI> his native city, before it was due. But he fir&s;t took care to learn as much of the art, as he could, to furni&s;h him&s;elf with Printing-tools, and to draw off &s;ome of <HI>Fau&s;t</HI>'s &s;er|vants with him. At <HI>Strasburgh</HI> he communicated to <HI>John Mentel</HI> or <HI>Men|telin</HI> the &s;ecret, and his de&s;ign of &s;etting up a Printing-hou&s;e there: how|ever neither he nor his workmen were &s;o throughly in&s;tructed in the bu|&s;ine&s;s, but they were oblig'd to demur a con&s;iderable time before they could perfect every thing for the work, and to make many tryals in order to attain the right method; which is evident from this, that there is no book extant with <HI>Mentel</HI>'s name 'till the year 1473, and not at all with <HI>Guttenbergh</HI>'s; for it is &s;carce probable, that if they had printed any con|&s;iderable volumes before that time, they &s;hould all have peri&s;h'd without being &s;o much as taken notice of by any author, and e&s;pecially by their learned town&s;man <HI>Wimpheling:</HI> whil&s;t there remain &s;o many of <HI>Fau&s;t</HI>'s in the writings and in the hands of the learned and curious. During this time <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> finding him&s;elf impos'd upon by <HI>Guttenbergh,</HI> and di&s;appointed of the money expected, and wanting either will o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> power to &s;ue him in that city where he fled, form'd a &s;trategem to rai&s;e him&s;elf a fre&s;h &s;upply, which &s;ucceeded according to his wi&s;h; for he went to <HI>Paris</HI> with &s;ome of his fine&s;t vellum <HI>bibles;</HI> one of which was &s;old to the king for 750 crowns, and is &s;till to be &s;een in the royal library at <HI>Paris,</HI> a ma&s;ter-piece in that kind: another was bought by the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Paris</HI> for 300 crowns: but as people were unwilling to give &s;o exorbitant a price, he offer'd &s;ome of the la&s;t for 50 crowns and le&s;s, in hopes to have di&s;pos'd of them all before he was di&s;cover'd. It is not indeed to be &s;uppos'd, that they were all equal in the ornamental part; yet the beauty of the work,
<PB N="88" REF="99">
the elegancy of the flower-pieces, initial letters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the variety of the fine&s;t colours intermix'd with gold and &s;ilver, with which they were ex|qui&s;itely variegated, made the purcha&s;ers fond of &s;hewing them to their acquaintance; as every one thought the whole world could not produce &s;uch another. 'Tis reported that the Archbi&s;hop thinking his <HI>bible</HI> worth his maje&s;ty's &s;eeing, carried it to him; who view'd it with &s;urprize, and in return &s;hew'd his own: upon a &s;tricter examination and comparing 'em together, they found that the ornaments were not exactly the &s;ame; but as to the other part &s;uppos'd to be written, they ob&s;erv'd &s;uch a confor|mity in the number of pages, lines, words, and even the letters, as &s;oon convinc'd them that they were done by &s;ome other method than tran&s;cri|bing: be&s;ides two &s;uch <HI>bibles</HI> were the work of a man's life-time to tran|&s;cribe; and upon enquiry he was found to have &s;old a much greater num|ber. Hereupon orders was given to apprehend <HI>Fau&s;tus,</HI> and pro&s;ecute him as a <HI>Conjurer:</HI> I &s;hould have been apt to think this charge too ab&s;urd to gain belief, except among the vulgar; and that it was only conniv'd at, in hopes it would terrify him to a di&s;covery of his art, were it not for a pa&s;&s;age which I have met with in Mr. <HI>Maichel</HI>'s hi&s;tory of the <HI>Paris</HI> libraries, where|in he mentions a &s;trange problem publi&s;h'd by Father <HI>Bouhours,</HI> a learned Je&s;uit<HI>&mdash;Whether it be po&s;&s;ible that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> German <HI>&s;hould be a wit?</HI> Mr. <HI>Maichel</HI> ju&s;tly takes the part of his country-men, and proves them much wi&s;er for the invention of Printing, than tho&s;e &s;tupid <HI>Paris</HI> doctors, who ra|ther believ'd it an effect of <HI>Magick,</HI> than of human wit or invention. <HI>De la Caille</HI> relates that he fled to <HI>Mentz,</HI> and &s;u&s;pecting his &s;afety there, de|parted to <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> where he taught <HI>John Mentel</HI> or <HI>Mentelin</HI> his Art: but there is not the lea&s;t probability for this a&s;&s;ertion, &s;ince he could not be &s;afer at one place than at another; and with re&s;pect to <HI>Mentel,</HI> it is much more probable tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> he learn'd the invention from <HI>Guttenbergh,</HI> than from <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> who perhaps was never at <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> unle&s;s he pa&s;s'd thro' it in his journey to and from <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER, the parliament of <HI>Paris</HI> thought fit to make an arre&s;t in favour of him, and to di&s;charge him from all further pro&s;ecution, in con|&s;ideration of his noble invention; and as I am credibly inform'd, a &s;ala|ry was paid by that crown to <HI>Fau&s;t</HI>'s de&s;cendants for many years after, as a reward for his &s;ufferings and merit: this was the end and &s;ucce&s;s of that

expedition, and prov'd at length very advantagious to him; and made &s;ome amends for the melancholy hours of his confinement, and the ter|rors of an approaching death.</P>
<P>FAUST di&s;charg'd thus with honour and a large &s;upply of money, re|turn'd to <HI>Mentz,</HI> where being inform'd that his quondam partner <HI>Gutten|bergh</HI> was endeavouring, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Mentel,</HI> to &s;et up a prin|ting-hou&s;e at <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> and to challenge to him&s;elf the whole glory of the invention; he began to con&s;ider, that it was not only in vain, but even dangerous to conceal him&s;elf and his art any longer from the world; and 'tis probable, re&s;olv'd at la&s;t to make both as publick as po&s;&s;ibly he could in all the editions, which came from his pre&s;s, 'till at lea&s;t, <HI>ann.</HI> 1466 or 1467, in which he is &s;uppos'd to have reprinted the la&s;t leaf of <HI>Tully</HI>'s <HI>Offices,</HI> the la&s;t book known to be printed by him. During the interval between 1457, and the taking of <HI>Mentz ann.</HI> 1462, <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> meet|ing with prodigious encouragement, was oblig'd to increa&s;e the num|ber of his workmen, and open more of the art to them, than he had done 'till then. Some of the&s;e having attain'd a &s;ufficient in&s;ight into the my|&s;tery, were induc'd to go &s;omewhere el&s;e, and &s;et up for them&s;elves; to which they were encourag'd, both by the example of tho&s;e who went away with <HI>Guttenbergh,</HI> and probably by invitations from other places, which were de&s;irous of having the Art brought to them. <HI>Pantaleon</HI> tells us, that &s;ome of tho&s;e who &s;ignaliz'd them&s;elves the fir&s;t in <HI>Italy,</HI> were of that number; and indeed if we con&s;ider how &s;oon they began to print in that kingdom, e&s;pecially <HI>Rome, Venice, &amp;c.</HI> and make a ju&s;t allowance for preparing the great apparatus of a Printing-hou&s;e, with their fir&s;t e&s;|&s;ays, before they came to work off tho&s;e volumes, which are of the olde&s;t date, &s;ome of them pretty large; we cannot but think that they left <HI>Mentz</HI> long before it was taken. <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> however had a &s;ufficient number of &s;er|vants left to fini&s;h his la&s;t editions, which are mention'd before; after this we hear no more of him 'till the year 1471, wherein <HI>Peter Schoeffer</HI> and one <HI>Henlif</HI> a book&s;eller gave a book to a mona&s;tery, in order to ob|tain the prayers of it for <HI>Fau&s;t</HI>'s &s;oul: by which it was apparent he was dead before that time, or perhaps before 1470, becau&s;e <HI>Schoeffer</HI> in that year printed St. <HI>Jerom</HI>'s <HI>Epi&s;tles</HI> in his own name, without any mention of his ma&s;ter <HI>Fau&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="101">
HERE therefore I am oblig'd to conclude the hi&s;tory of that <HI>illu&s;trious man,</HI> tho' I &s;hould have been va&s;tly more &s;atisfy'd in communicating other particulars of his life and death, could I have found 'em in the wri|ters of tho&s;e times. But <HI>Germany</HI> is not the only ungrateful country that has neglected &s;uch as have be&s;t de&s;erv'd of her; for the following books will furni&s;h us with in&s;tances of this in other parts of the world. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that as it is the property of fal&s;e de&s;ert to be &s;olicitous for panegyricks and monumental records, whil&s;t true and intrin&s;ick me|rit is &s;ilent, and equally contemns both; &s;o whil&s;t the <HI>Dutch</HI> be&s;tow the highe&s;t encomiums upon a <HI>&s;uppo&s;itious and imaginary inventor:</HI> the <HI>Germans</HI> have been &s;o regardle&s;s of a <HI>true</HI> and <HI>real</HI> one, as to leave it entirely to his own works to tran&s;mit his prai&s;es to po&s;terity. If <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> had died be|fore the &s;acking of <HI>Mentz,</HI> we might have had grounds to &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;ome monument had been erected to his memory by his fellow-citizens, and de&s;troy'd by the conqueror; but as he &s;urviv'd tho&s;e times at lea&s;t <HI>&s;ix</HI> or <HI>&s;even</HI> years, and carry'd on and improv'd the Art during that in|terval, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to entertain &s;o favourable an opinion of the <HI>Mogun|tines.</HI> However his books and the art which he left us, will more effe|ctually and univer&s;ally proclaim and perpetuate his name and memory, than any monumental in&s;criptions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and endear both to the learned and curious, as long as the Art or the world it&s;elf &s;hall endure.</P>
<P>THERE is one occurrence worthy to be mention'd, which I omitted in this chapter, not &s;o much out of forgetfulne&s;s or neglect, &s;ince it is an in&s;tance of <HI>Fau&s;t</HI>'s gratitude and genero&s;ity, as becau&s;e it is not ea&s;y to fix the time of it, nor &s;o likely to have happen'd within the compa&s;s of the&s;e <HI>ten</HI> years, as of &s;ome of the former, <HI>viz.</HI> between 1440 and 1450. That is, his giving his only daughter in marriage to his &s;ervant <HI>Peter Schoeffer,</HI> admitting him into partner&s;hip, and procuring him the free|dom of the city of <HI>Mentz,</HI> as a reward for his &s;ervices, and the improve|ments which he made to the Art; &s;uch as the invention of punches, ma|trices, metal-types; and, as &s;ome report, Printer's ink: if the&s;e di&s;co|veries are owing to him, <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> made him as ample amends as he could po&s;&s;ibly. I wi&s;h <HI>Schoeffer</HI> had been &s;o grateful to his generous ma&s;ter, as to have tran&s;mitted to us a fuller account of his life and character, than what we enjoy; or if he perform'd this, that time had not depriv'd us

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. The Conclu&s;ion with an Account of the antient Me|thod of <HI>Printing.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I AM now come to the clo&s;e of the fir&s;t book of this hi&s;tory, which I have endeavour'd to inrich with collections from dead and living authors, and every thing valuable that I could procure upon this &s;ub|ject, from many of the mo&s;t curious libraries. The next book will open a large and plea&s;ant &s;cene. In the mean time I cannot conclude this bet|ter, than by giving a &s;hort &s;ummary of the whole, and dige&s;ting it into di&s;tinct periods, that the reader may, as it were at one view, &s;ee the whole progre&s;s of the Art, and fix it more ea&s;ily in his memory; and by clo&s;ing it with an account of the old way of printing us'd during the time of <HI>Fau&s;t,</HI> his &s;on-in-law, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. THIS Art was devis'd a con&s;iderable time before any thing done that way appear'd.</P>
<P N="2">2. 'TIS not improbable that the fir&s;t hints of engraving upon wooden|blocks might come from the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> who practis'd it above 300 years before it was thought of in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. THE attempts to imitate it began about the year 1440, and not before.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE new and more perfect method of Printing with fu&s;ile-types did not &s;ucceed it 'till 10 years after, <HI>viz.</HI> 1450.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="92" REF="103">
5. THIS new invention was di&s;cover'd by <HI>John Fau&s;t</HI> in the city of <HI>Mentz;</HI> in the perfecting of which <HI>Peter Schoeffer</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted him very much, and was amply rewarded by his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>JOHN GUTTENBERGH had no other &s;hare or merit in this di&s;covery, than by promoting it with &s;upplies of money from time to time, and that not from a principle of a publick &s;pirit, but for his own intere&s;t, which made him drop both the Art and Arti&s;t when he found it le&s;s gainful than he expected.</P>
<P N="6">6. THIS invention was kept with all imaginable &s;ecrecy by the&s;e three parties, 'till <HI>Guttenbergh,</HI> upon a difference between them, took &s;ome of their &s;ervants with him to <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> where he began to practi&s;e it, and to teach it to <HI>John Mentel:</HI> The per&s;on in who&s;e favour the <HI>Strasburgh</HI> preten&s;ions were afterwards &s;tarted.</P>
<P N="7">7. THIS contention not happening 'till the year 1455, they had already printed the <HI>latin bible,</HI> and perhaps privately di&s;pos'd of &s;ome number of the copies, &s;eeing their di&s;pute was about &s;tating their accounts, and balancing the charges and profits of the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P N="8">8. WHETHER their fir&s;t &s;eparate types were of wood, or lead, or any other metal; they ventur'd to print their fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays but on one &s;ide of the page, 'till they had found out a better ink than the common &s;ort which they then us'd.</P>
<P N="9">9. IT is probable from this circum&s;tance, that their fir&s;t improvement upon common ink, to prevent its &s;preading, was only by charging it with a proportionable quantity of &s;ome watery gum; &s;uch as gum ara|bick, ma&s;tick, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which tho' it remedied that defect, would not &s;uffer the paper to be printed but upon one &s;ide: but either <HI>Schoeffer</HI> or his ma|&s;ter having found out the way of making it with oyl, they then printed on both &s;ides.</P>
<P N="10">10. THEY did not begin to put their names and in&s;criptions at the end of their books, as we can yet find, 'till the year 1457: this they conti|nued to do 'till <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> either dyed or left off the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="93" REF="104">
11. GUTTENBERGH's name was never joyn'd with theirs, nor put to of the books which he printed after he abandon'd <HI>Fau&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. SOME others of <HI>Fau&s;t</HI>'s &s;ervants for&s;ook him before the taking of <HI>Mentz,</HI> and &s;ettled &s;ome at <HI>Cologn,</HI> others in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. THE greate&s;t di&s;per&s;ion of them was, when that noble city was taken and plunder'd by Archbi&s;hop <HI>Adolph, ann.</HI> 1462; &s;o that the Art became univer&s;ally known throughout <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>THERE remains now only to give the reader an idea of the fir&s;t way of Printing, and of what is mo&s;t peculiar to it; which, tho' a &s;ubject well known by the curious, may not be unacceptable to &s;everal per&s;ons, to who&s;e hands this work may chance to fall.</P>
<P N="1">1. WITH re&s;pect to their forms, they were generally either large or &s;mall <HI>folio's,</HI> or at lea&s;t <HI>quarto's:</HI> the le&s;&s;er &s;izes were not in u&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE leaves were without running-title, direction-word, number of pages, or divi&s;ions into paragraphs.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE character it&s;elf was a rude old <HI>Gothic</HI> mix'd with <HI>Secretary,</HI> ca&s;t on purpo&s;e to imitate the hand-writing of tho&s;e times; the words were printed &s;o clo&s;e to one another, that it was difficult and tedious even to tho&s;e who were us'd to MSS. and to this method; and often lead the in|attentive reader into mi&s;takes.</P>
<P N="4">4. THEIR orthography was various and often arbitrary; and as for the diphthongs ae and oe, they were not at all careful about them.</P>
<P N="5">5. THEY had very frequent abbreviations, which in time grew &s;o nu|merous and difficult to be under&s;tood, that there was a nece&s;&s;ity of writing a book to teach the manner of reading them.</P>
<P N="6">6. THEIR periods were di&s;tingui&s;h'd by no other points than the double and &s;ingle one, <HI>i. e.</HI> the <HI>colon</HI> and <HI>full &s;top;</HI> ju&s;t after the &s;ame man|ner
<PB N="94" REF="105">
as the reading <HI>p&s;alms,</HI> in our <HI>Common prayer-books</HI> are pointed; all other punctuations being of much later invention.</P>
<P N="7">7. THEY us'd no great letters to begin a &s;entence or proper name of men or places.</P>
<P N="8">8. THEY left blanks for the places of titles, initial letters, and other ornaments, in order to have them &s;upply'd by the illuminators, who&s;e in|genious art, tho' in vogue before and at that time, yet did not long &s;ur|vive the ma&s;terly improvements made by the printers in this branch of their Art. Tho&s;e ornaments were exqui&s;itely fine, and curiou&s;ly variega|ted with the mo&s;t beautiful colours, and even with gold and &s;ilver; the margins likewi&s;e were frequently charged with variety of figures of &s;aints, birds, bea&s;ts, mon&s;ters, flowers &amp;c. which had &s;ometimes relation to the contents of the page, tho' mo&s;tly none at all: the&s;e embelli&s;hments were very co&s;tly; but for tho&s;e that could not afford a round price, there were others done after a more ordinary manner and at much cheaper rates.</P>
<P N="9">9. THE names of the printer, place, &amp;c. were either wholly neglected or put at the end of the book, not without &s;ome pious ejaculation or doxology.</P>
<P N="10">10. THE date was likewi&s;e omitted or involv'd in &s;ome crampt cir|cum&s;tantial period, or el&s;e printed either at full length, or by numerical letters, and &s;ometimes partly one and partly the other, thus; <HI>one thou&s;and</HI> CCCC and <HI>&s;ixty,</HI> &amp;c. but all of them at the end of the book.</P>
<P N="11">11. THERE was no variety of characters, no intermixture of <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Italick;</HI> which were of later invention; but their pages were conti|nued in a <HI>Gothick</HI> letter of the &s;ame &s;ize throughout.</P>
<P N="12">12. THEIR <HI>Rubricks</HI> which were very frequent and added no &s;mall beauty to the pages, were &s;ometimes done by the &s;ame hands as the initial letters.</P>
<P N="13"><PB N="95" REF="106">
13. WHENEVER they met with any <HI>Greek,</HI> they either left a blank for it, to be afterwards fill'd up by writing if the pa&s;&s;age was long; or if &s;hort, con&s;i&s;ting only of three or four words, they got it cut on wood, tho' after &s;uch a rude and ill-&s;hap'd manner, that it required &s;ome pau&s;e to be read.</P>
<P N="14">14. THE quotations of the places out of which they were taken, were very often neglected both in Manu&s;cripts and printed books, which caus'd the curious no &s;mall trouble to find them out.</P>
<P N="15">15. THEY had &s;eldom dedicatory or prefatory epi&s;tles; and when they began afterwards to retail them in their impre&s;&s;ions, they generally plac'd 'em at the end of the work; a piece of ju&s;tice as much neglected, as want|ing in our age.</P>
<P N="16">16. THEY collected no <HI>table</HI> of <HI>contents,</HI> no <HI>index</HI> nor <HI>&s;ummary,</HI> (which are indubitably a great help to the reader,) nor any <HI>errata's</HI> at the end; for what faults were in their editions were rather owing to the manu&s;cripts which they printed after, than to the carele&s;ne&s;s of the Printer.</P>
<P N="17">17. THEY printed but few copies at once, for 200 or 300 were then e&s;teem'd a large impre&s;&s;ion; tho' upon the encouragements receiv'd from the learned, they increas'd their numbers in proportion.</P>
<P N="18">18. LASTLY, If I may be allow'd this article, they were not &s;olicitous to obtain <HI>privileges</HI> and <HI>patents</HI> for the &s;ole printing of any particular volume, tho' towards the later end of <HI>Fau&s;t's</HI> time &s;everal of his &s;ervants &s;et up Printing-hou&s;es, and were ambitious to excel their ma&s;ter: How &s;oon after tho&s;e privileges began, appears from that granted by the Em|peror to <HI>John Schoeffer, Fau&s;t's</HI> grand&s;on <HI>ann.</HI> 1519, for the &s;ole printing <HI>T. Livius,</HI> and to prohibit any other to reprint tho&s;e books which had come from his pre&s;s: and as this had been granted upon the account of his being the grand&s;on of the fir&s;t inventor of the Art; &s;o &s;everal Popes and Princes gave like patents to their fir&s;t Printers as a mark of their favour.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="107">
I &s;hall here mention &s;omething concerning their way of Book-binding, an account of which we find in <HI>Scaliger</HI> <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><HI>Scaligeriana, Hag. edit. in 8vo.</HI> p. 173.</NOTE>, who tells us, that his grandmo|ther had a printed P&s;alter, the cover of which was two inches thick; in the in&s;ide was a kind of cupboard, wherein was a &s;mall &s;ilver crucifix, and behind it the name of <HI>Berenica Codronia de la Scala.</HI> This book &s;eems to have been printed with wood, but probably bound like the re&s;t.</P>
<P>AS to the prices of their books, I cannot find any thing particular ex|cept what I have before quoted out of <HI>Campanus's</HI> dedication to the Pope; from which it may be infer'd, that in his time at <HI>Rome</HI> they were &s;old for about one fifth part of what the MSS. had done.

<P>WE meet with an account of a <HI>German</HI> Bible, &s;till kept in the library of the city of <HI>Ausburgh,</HI> affirm'd by <HI>Hottinger,</HI> who &s;aw it there, to have been printed with fu&s;ile types <HI>ann.</HI> 1448, but with this caveat however, <HI>ni fallor, if I am not mi&s;taken,</HI> as writing at &s;ome di&s;tance of time and place: other authors have given it that of 1449, but as either of them preceded the time of the invention, <HI>Malinkrot</HI> tells us, that <HI>Martin Zeiler</HI> thought it 'twas only a manu&s;cript ver&s;ion made <HI>ann.</HI> 1449: but Mr. <HI>Beug|ben</HI> doth not &s;cruple to tell us in the preliminary di&s;cour&s;e to his <HI>Incunabu|la Typographiae,</HI> that they only mi&s;plac'd the two la&s;t figures of the date, and printed 1449 in&s;tead of 1494. <HI>Chevillier</HI> mentions two more out of <HI>Lipenius,</HI> who&s;e dates are demon&s;trably fal&s;e, the one is a Bible printed at <HI>Paris ann.</HI> 1443, and the other at <HI>Lyons ann.</HI> 1446: whereas it is cer|tain, that Printing was not brought to <HI>Paris</HI> 'till <HI>twenty &s;even</HI> years af|ter the date of the fir&s;t, <HI>viz. ann.</HI> 1470, nor to <HI>Lyons</HI> 'till <HI>&s;ix</HI> or <HI>&s;even</HI> years after that: the &s;ame may be &s;aid of another printed at <HI>Ba&s;il,</HI> and affirm'd, by two book&s;ellers of <HI>Geneva</HI> in the catalogue of their books, to bear date
<PB N="99" REF="110">
1459, &s;ince 'tis plain that that city did not receive the Art 'till about 1475: if the reader therefore will take this rule with him, to examine the time in which the Art was brought to any place, which he will find in the following Book, he will ea&s;ily rectify any wrong date that may come in his way, and as for tho&s;e, which do not mention the place or Prin|ter's name, he may &s;afely rank them among&s;t the apocryphal ones, and them which have no date at all, but as the former have been taken no|tice of by all our annali&s;ts, I &s;hall be obliged &s;o far as I am able to a&s;cer|tain their re&s;pective dates, as we go along.</P>
<P N="1">1. BEFORE I come to &s;peak of tho&s;e, which bear a certain and indi&s;puta|ble date, I mu&s;t not omit the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> printed by <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> and <HI>Schoeffer</HI> about 1450 or &s;oon after, and mention'd by <HI>Trithemius,</HI> the <HI>Colognian Chroni|cle,</HI> and &s;ome other authors, as the fir&s;t con&s;iderable work printed with fu&s;ile types by tho&s;e two <HI>Protodaedali.</HI> I have already given the rea&s;ons of its being printed without date or colophon, which would have betray|ed the di&s;covery of their new Art, and prevented <HI>Fau&s;t</HI>'s &s;elling it for MS: but this however ought by no means to hinder us from giving it the fir&s;t rank, &s;eeing the fact is &s;o undeniably atte&s;ted. It is pity they have been long ago, either de&s;troy'd, or buried in &s;ome private libra|ries, where the mo&s;t diligent &s;earches have not as yet been able to find them out: perhaps its being printed &s;o like MS, may be one rea&s;on why they are &s;till lookt upon as &s;uch by the owners, if any &s;uch there be; for which rea&s;on I am &s;till willing to hope, that time may di&s;cover and bring &s;ome of them to light, and that what has been &s;aid in this hi&s;to|ry, and by authors of a much higher character, will &s;pur up &s;ome curi|ous per&s;ons to make a more diligent &s;earch after &s;o valuable a monu|ment; 'till when, no farther account can be expected of it than what we have already given.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE next is that, which I have ventur'd, after other authors, to call the &s;econd impre&s;&s;ion of the Bible, printed at <HI>Mentz</HI> by the &s;ame worthy in|ventors <HI>ann.</HI> 1462, and which is con&s;equently the mo&s;t antient we know ex|tant in any library; we have already given &s;ome account of it in a for|mer chapter <HI>p.</HI> 31, and of the colophon printed at the end of it, which we need not therefore repeat here: as there are &s;everal copies of it here in <HI>London</HI> where I have &s;een them, and el&s;ewhere in <HI>England,</HI> we need not
<PB N="100" REF="111">
go to any foreign authors for an account of it: it is printed in <HI>fol.</HI> as in|deed all their other works were. For tho' I have follow'd <HI>Peter Lambeck</HI>'s notion of the P&s;alters being printed in <HI>4to,</HI> becau&s;e its &s;ize may be very much like that of a <HI>quarto,</HI> yet if I may here venture to give my judgment of a book I have not &s;een, I think I have &s;ufficient grounds to believe that the fir&s;t Printers had their paper made of all &s;izes; and that the <HI>five books</HI> printed on Blocks of Wood, already mention'd to be in the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI>'s library, would appear to any one like <HI>quarto's,</HI> were it not that the &s;ignatures &s;hew the contrary.</P>
<P>THE next impre&s;&s;ion we meet with, is one which Mr. <HI>Mattaire</HI> gives us upon the authority of a learned friend of his, who de&s;ires to have his name conceal'd, and the want of who&s;e date is &s;upply'd by a colophon of three <HI>latin</HI> ver&s;es importing, that it was printed in the <HI>third</HI> year of <HI>Lewis</HI> XI. reign, <HI>i. e. ann.</HI> 1464 by the three <HI>German</HI> partners, who brought the Art to <HI>Paris,</HI> tho' there be no mention made of the place where it was printed, vid. <HI>Annal. Typogr.</HI> p. 41, and 60. I am per&s;uaded that Mr. <HI>Mat|taire's</HI> friend was mi&s;taken in the fir&s;t ver&s;e, and I &s;hould not have given it a rank here, nor even mention'd it, were it not to prevent the reader's being puzzled with this account of it under the year 1464; or his &s;uppo|&s;ing me guilty of an omi&s;&s;ion: but as <HI>Chevillier</HI> gives us the &s;ame colo|phon printed at the end of the fir&s;t <HI>Paris</HI> Bible by the &s;ame three part|ners, with this variation however from the former; that in the fir&s;t ver&s;e, in&s;tead of <HI>Semi lu&s;trum,</HI> it has <HI>tribus lu&s;tris,</HI> that is in&s;tead of the <HI>third,</HI> it imports the <HI>thirteenth</HI> year of that king's reign: we may ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e, that it was the fir&s;t <HI>Paris</HI> Bible of 1475, and that this unknown gentleman might po&s;&s;ibly be mi&s;taken: however the book being in <HI>Queen's-college</HI> library, in <HI>Cambridge</HI> it may be ea&s;ily con&s;ulted.</P>
<P N="3">3. The next impre&s;&s;ion therefore to that of <HI>Mentz</HI> 1462, is that of <HI>Au&s;|burgh,</HI> [in latin <HI>Augu&s;ta Vindelicorum]</HI> printed by <HI>John Bemler ann.</HI> 1466 in latin <HI>fol.</HI> It is mention'd by <HI>Martin Cru&s;ius, Melchior Adamus,</HI> and after them by <HI>Malinkrot; Chevillier</HI> &s;eems indeed to think their te&s;timony in|&s;ufficient to a&s;certain &s;o old a date, but I cannot &s;ee any rea&s;on for it, &s;eeing it is four years more recent than the taking of the city of <HI>Mentz,</HI> and the di&s;per&s;ion of <HI>Fau&s;t's</HI> &s;ervants; be&s;ides the city of <HI>Ausburgh</HI> was &s;o near <HI>Mentz,</HI> and &s;o con&s;iderable withal, that it is no way improbable,
<PB N="101" REF="112">
but &s;ome one of them might go and &s;ettle there even &s;ooner than the year 1466.</P>
<P N="4">4.

<P>I have purpo&s;edly omitted &s;ome le&s;s con&s;iderable ones, which are either without Printer or places name, or both; becau&s;e &s;uch were only the wretched performances of a few, who made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to reprint the editions of &s;ome of the mo&s;t famous Printers of <HI>Europe,</HI> whether of the Bible, or of any other con&s;iderable work; and to vend them under|hand for the right ones: this was an abu&s;e which began very early to be complain'd of; for no &s;ooner had a <HI>Froben, Badius, Aldus</HI> or any other
<PB N="107" REF="118">
great Printer publi&s;h'd a work, which had co&s;t him infinite pains to cor|rect, as well as great &s;ums of money to purcha&s;e the be&s;t manu&s;cripts, but they pyrated them in &s;uch a &s;hameful and incorrect manner, that they could afford to &s;ell them for le&s;s than half the price. And as there wanted not &s;ordid per&s;ons to encourage this vile practice, and to prefer tho&s;e maim'd performances to the more correct ones, if they could but &s;ave money by them; it often prov'd that the &s;ale of a valuable edition was hinder'd, to the great lo&s;s and di&s;couragement of the Printer, whil&s;t the bad ones went off with ea&s;e: this occa&s;ion'd them to complain of the abu&s;e, in their prefaces to their works, and to appeal to the learned again&s;t &s;uch practices; &s;ome of whom (in particular <HI>Era&s;mus)</HI> did not fail to write very &s;harply again&s;t tho&s;e enemies to learning, who were at length come up to &s;uch a degree of impudence, as to counterfeit the names, marks and rebus's of the famous Printers, of which we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to give an account hereafter. In the mean time, all their complaints and efforts proving ineffectual towards the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing &s;uch pyracies; they were forc'd to have recour&s;e to the higher powers, and to employ the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their learned patrons, to obtain them patents and privileges for the &s;ole printing of tho&s;e works, upon which they had be&s;tow'd &s;o much pains and co&s;t: but this more properly belongs to the next book to which I am now ha&s;tening.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>The INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>HITHERTO we have &s;een the <HI>Art of Printing</HI> kept with the utmo&s;t &s;ecrecy by its inventors, and confin'd to the city of <HI>Mentz,</HI> till the fatal year of its being ta|ken plunder'd and depriv'd of all its former rights and franchi&s;es, as we have hinted already: which occa&s;ion'd the di&s;per&s;ion of the greate&s;t part of <HI>Fau&s;t's</HI> &s;ervants whom we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e by that time to have been very numerous: the&s;e &s;eeing the deplorable condition to which that noble city was reduc'd, and the difficulty of carrying on the bu&s;ine&s;s any longer with that freedom and encouragement they had till then enjoy'd; and being perhaps inclin'd enough of them&s;elves to leave their ma&s;ters, to go &s;ettle in &s;ome of the mo&s;t famous cities of <HI>Europe,</HI> where they were &s;ure to gain, not only wealth and honour, but the friend&s;hip of the learn|ed, immediately di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves and &s;ettled, &s;ome in the neighbour|ing cities of <HI>Cologn</HI> and <HI>Ausburgh,</HI> others went to <HI>Rome, Venice, Paris, &amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="109" REF="120">
where they &s;oon met with all the encouragement they could wi&s;h: this happen'd, as we have hinted in the former book in the year 1462. So that <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> and <HI>Schoeffer,</HI> had happily conceal'd the art from the re&s;t of the world, at lea&s;t the &s;pace of <HI>twelve</HI> years from the time of its being perfected: we mu&s;t, however, except one of his &s;ervants <HI>viz. Nic. Jen&s;on,</HI> who if the date of his fir&s;t book be true and genuine, mu&s;t have given his ma&s;ter the &s;lip before that fatal period, &s;ince we find this book fini&s;h|ed at <HI>Venice an.</HI> 1461 with great advantage and improvement; we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to enquire further into this man and his work, in the &s;equel of this book: however, if we except this one &s;ingle work, we don't find any foot&s;teps of the infant art, being carry'd out of its nur&s;e's arms du|ing tho&s;e twelve years.</P>
<P>BUT now we mu&s;t con&s;ider it in a different view, di&s;per&s;ing it &s;elf over divers nations, patroniz'd by Popes and Kings, and e&s;teem'd a di|vine ble&s;&s;ing to mankind. It &s;eems now to have left the city of <HI>Mentz,</HI> where it yet &s;hines there brighter than ever; and at the &s;ame in&s;tant di&s;|covers it &s;elf at <HI>Rome, Venice, Oxford</HI> and <HI>Paris;</HI> and in a &s;pace &s;horter than can be imagin'd, becomes con&s;picuous over all <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>As there is &s;o great a number and variety of events and remarkable occurrences, which happen'd in &s;everal cities of <HI>Europe,</HI> at the &s;ame time, or immediately after one another, with re&s;pect to the fir&s;t printers who &s;ettled there, the improvements made by them, and the encouragement they receiv'd; it will be ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;po&s;e them in &s;uch an order, as may give the reader at once a full view of them all, with|out interrupting the &s;eries, either with re&s;pect to time or place. Thus, for in&s;tance, while we &s;hew the tran&s;actions at <HI>Rome,</HI> during the <HI>two</HI> or three fir&s;t years, <HI>Venice, Paris, Oxford, Cologn, Milan, &amp;c.</HI> will open new &s;cenes to our view, attracting our eyes towards them, and oblige us to break the thread of one to begin with that of another; which continual diver&s;ions would rather confound than in&s;truct the reader, and render the hi&s;tory confus'd and tedious. Our be&s;t annali&s;ts and hi&s;torians being &s;en&s;ible of this, have follow'd a better method. Father <HI>Orlandi</HI> in par|ticular, the late&s;t that has wrote upon this &s;ubject, hath taken that of <HI>De la Caille;</HI> who proceeds with every city by it &s;elf, from the time it is &s;uppos'd to have receiv'd the art, to the end of the century, according to their faire&s;t claim to priority in point of time; and then goes on with
<PB N="110" REF="121">
the next in order. This method I have cho&s;e, and given under the head of each city the names, character and merit, of each printer that has wrought there, from the time of its receiving the art to the end of the year 1500; and pointed out the excellencies of tho&s;e who have been emi|nent in this art, either by the beauty of their types, the elegance and correctne&s;s of their works, the number of their editions, or any improve|ments which they made. By this means, I hope the reader will clearly &s;ee the early progre&s;s of printing in every place; if not at one view, yet at lea&s;t in &s;uch an order as more ea&s;ily to form an idea, not only of the printers and cities wherein they re&s;ided, but likewi&s;e of the mo&s;t con&s;ide|rable patrons for wealth, learning, &amp;c. of that time, to who&s;e character and merit, I have not failed to do ju&s;tice throughout this whole work.</P>
<P>I propos'd at fir&s;t to have clos'd this hi&s;tory with the fifteenth century; but when I came to con&s;ider that the mo&s;t eminent printers, to whom we owe many important improvements of this art, &s;uch as <HI>Aldus</HI> at <HI>Venice, Amerbach</HI> and <HI>Froben</HI> at <HI>Ba&s;il, Badius</HI> at <HI>Lyons</HI> and <HI>Paris,</HI> with many others, did not begin to appear upon this &s;tage, till almo&s;t the clo&s;e of it: and that their merit was not di&s;cover'd till the beginning of the next; I thought it an unpardonable inju&s;tice to them and my readers, to curtail their hi&s;tory by too &s;crupulou&s;ly adhering to my propos'd epocha; and therefore have cho&s;en to continue this hi&s;tory <HI>twenty</HI> years longer, <HI>i. e.</HI> to 1520; and &s;ometimes made an excur&s;ion beyond that time, when ever any of tho&s;e excellent ma&s;ters have outliv'd it. This has afforded me another agreeable opportunity, <HI>viz.</HI> of mentioning &s;ome others who did not enter the province of printing till after the fifteenth century.</P>
<P>ANOTHER motive which induc'd me to continue this hi&s;tory 20 years longer, was, that I found all the improvements that had been made to the art, were made by that time <HI>i. e.</HI> by the year 1520 at lea&s;t; the foun|dation of them was &s;o far lay'd before that year, that whatever has been done &s;ince, either with relation to the beauty of letter, elegancy of im|pre&s;&s;ion, variety of types, printing in different languages, e&s;pecially in the ea&s;tern ones, in different columns, correctne&s;s and the like, all the&s;e and many more, had already been carry'd on to &s;uch a perfection before this time, that it admitted but of &s;mall improvements to be made to it afterwards. I have therefore thought it a much better period to clo&s;e
<PB N="111" REF="122">
this hi&s;tory with, than that of 1500 where <HI>Orlandi</HI> concludes his; this has given me an opportunity of mentioning not only the improvements them|&s;elves, but likewi&s;e tho&s;e glorious printers to whom we owe them. How|ever, as it would &s;well this book too much to in&s;ert the names of all the printers, that appear'd within tho&s;e 20 years, they being too numerous, and a great many of them, de&s;erving rather to be remember'd with &s;hame than honour: I have re&s;olv'd to &s;peak only of tho&s;e who &s;ignaliz'd them&s;elves, either for &s;ome improvements they made to the art, the beauty and correctne&s;s of their editions, or any other merit they have been con&s;picuous for: it is for that rea&s;on I have cho&s;en to &s;peak of them in a chapter by it &s;elf, after I have clos'd the 15th century, to which I &s;hall al&s;o add in another chapter, an account of the abu&s;es which crept into the art from its promulgation to 1520, that there may be nothing wanting to make this hi&s;tory as compleat and in&s;tructing as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>IT will be nece&s;&s;ary to acquaint the reader that tho' we have follow'd the method of the be&s;t annali&s;ts, in &s;ettling the priority of every city, ac|cording to the date of the olde&s;t extant work, that was printed there, which is certainly the &s;ure&s;t way and lea&s;t liable to mi&s;takes; yet it is more than probable that they might receive the art much &s;ooner: &s;eeing &s;ome time mu&s;t rea&s;onably be allow'd for &s;etting up a printing-hou&s;e, and furni&s;hing it with the nece&s;&s;ary apparatus, which in the infancy of the art was more difficult to procure, for want of proper workmen acquaint|ed with all the branches of &s;uch a tedious work, for which le&s;s than a year or two could &s;carce &s;uffice: and becau&s;e we are not ab&s;olutely &s;ure that tho&s;e editions, which we give for their fir&s;t, were really &s;o: Mr. <HI>Mattaire,</HI> who has taken &s;uch pains to &s;earch the be&s;t libraries of <HI>London, Oxford, Paris,</HI> &amp;c. for tho&s;e old monuments, that he thought he had exhau|&s;ted that &s;ubject, has neverthele&s;s po&s;t dated the claim and rank of &s;everal cities by &s;ome years; if <HI>Orlandi</HI> may be credited, who afterwards rectify'd them by the di&s;covery of &s;ome older editions; and who can tell what time may produce, that may wholly invert our pre&s;ent order: thus for in&s;tance &s;ome of the hi&s;torians quoted in the la&s;t book, tell us that <HI>Stras|burgh, Cologn, Francford,</HI> &amp;c. receiv'd the art before any others; yet as we have none of their works extant, but &s;uch as were printed &s;ome years
<PB N="112" REF="123">
after, we have been oblig'd to give them a lower rank, and place them after <HI>Rome, Paris, Venice,</HI> &amp;c. The reader may ea&s;ily remember that <HI>Guttenbergh</HI> left <HI>Mentz,</HI> and &s;ettled at <HI>Strasburgh</HI> &s;ome years before the ta|king of the former, <HI>i. e.</HI> before <HI>ann.</HI> 1462; and that he taught <HI>John Men|tel</HI> the Art in the latter: yet we meet with no edition done there of older date than 1471, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Decretum Gratiani</HI> printed by <HI>Henry Ege&s;tein.</HI> Tho' <HI>Cologn</HI> receiv'd &s;ome of <HI>Fau&s;t's</HI> fugitive &s;ervants &s;oon after his rup|ture with <HI>Guttenbergh,</HI> yet the olde&s;t edition there, as yet known, is the works of Pope <HI>Leo</HI> I, printed 1470. What became of tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions before that time, is &s;carce worth our enquiring, &s;ince the be&s;t of tho&s;e which have been &s;ince publi&s;h'd, are far inferior to tho&s;e done in <HI>Italy, France,</HI> &amp;c. in beauty of character, elegancy of compo&s;ition, correctne&s;s and choice of MSS to print after; while them&s;elves proved indolent enough to neglect tho&s;e improvements even after they had been made in other countries.</P>
<P>HOWEVER 'tis probable they might have &s;ufficient bu&s;ine&s;s in printing &s;mall books of devotion, lives of &s;aints, and legends; which, according to the ta&s;t of tho&s;e times, and of that nation in particular, were eagerly bought up and thumb'd over, 'till &s;carce a leaf was left; while the men of learning and politene&s;s were more curious in laying up &s;uch only as were a credit not only to the author and Printer, but to the Art it &s;elf. But however that be, I hope what I have &s;aid will &s;ufficiently convince the reader, how cautious we &s;hould be in fixing the epocha's, and con&s;e|quently the rank and claims of every city, in this re&s;pect; &s;ince we know not but the next diligent &s;earcher may find matter enough to give this or|der a new turn.</P>
<P>I have &s;hown in the clo&s;e of the la&s;t book to what a degree of perfecti|on the Art of Printing was advanc'd even before the year 1467, and given there &s;ome account of that noble edition of <HI>Nich. Jen&s;on,</HI> which is &s;up|pos'd to be done <HI>ann.</HI> 1461, with the encomium which Mr. <HI>Mattaire,</HI> to whom we are beholden for the fir&s;t account of it, about <HI>eight</HI> years ago, gives to that ma&s;ter-piece of the Art, &s;ince which I &s;aw it at the Earl of <HI>Pem|broke</HI>'s. What &s;eems &s;trange in that Printer, is, that from the time of this date 1461 to 1471, not one of his impre&s;&s;ions is to be met with; &s;o that neither their beauty, nor the e&s;teem which they merited among the curi|ous,
<PB N="113" REF="124">
have been able to pre&s;erve them, unle&s;s they are &s;till latent in &s;ome libraries, 'till &s;ome accident brings them to light, as happen'd to the <HI>De|cor Puellarum.</HI> 'Tis unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that a man, who could, in &s;o &s;hort a time improve the Art, to a degree equal to the be&s;t Printers of the next age, and publi&s;h'd &s;o many excellent volumes from 1470 to 1480, &s;hould have continued idle for <HI>nine</HI> or <HI>ten</HI> years.</P>
<P>FOR this rea&s;on many learned per&s;ons are of opinion that the date of the book is wrong printed, and that one of the X's was either carele&s;sly or wilfully omitted, or taken up by the balls: but Mr. <HI>Mattaire</HI> will by no means allow this &s;uppo&s;ition, and gives his rea&s;ons again&s;t it. But tho' I am partly of his opinion, yet there are two rea&s;ons that induce me to differ from father <HI>Orlandi,</HI> in allowing the preference to <HI>Venice</HI> before the&s;e la&s;t mention'd cities: the fir&s;t is that this impre&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Decor Puellarum,</HI> doth not mention the place where it was done, and therefore might as well have been printed in any other place as at <HI>Venice;</HI> our an|nali&s;ts give no other rea&s;on for its being done there rather than any where el&s;e, but that <HI>Jen&s;on</HI> is found, ten years after the date of it, flou|ri&s;hing in that city for the &s;pace of another ten years; but how to fill the cha&s;m of the fir&s;t ten is what they are at a great lo&s;s, as we &s;hall &s;ee by and by. My &s;econd rea&s;on is that had this book been really printed at <HI>Venice, ann.</HI> 1461, it would have been ab&s;urd for the two <HI>Spires,</HI> who did not &s;ettle th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">e till about <HI>ann.</HI> 1468, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ve taken upon them in their fir&s;t colophon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the title of the fir&s;t per&s;ons who taught the city of <HI>Venice</HI> the art of printing, or if they had, I doubt not but <HI>Jen&s;on</HI> would have taken care to have confuted &s;uch an a&s;&s;umption in &s;ome of his own works, which he never did: allowing therefore the date of this work to be genuine, yet it would be too pre&s;umptive to build the claim of that city upon a book, which for ought appears was not printed there.</P>
<P>I have ven ur'd to &s;ay &s;o much concerning this impre&s;&s;ion, in this in|troduction, becau&s;e of its being dated one year before the time our &s;e|cond book begins; &s;o that it could not &s;o properly be brought into the book it&s;elf, without antedating of it by that one year for the &s;ake of one impre&s;&s;ion. Before Mr <HI>Mattaire</HI> gave us an account of it in his <HI>Annal.

I hope the reader will excu&s;e me, if the re&s;pect which I bear to tho&s;e noble cities, who gave the fir&s;t encouragement to this infant Art, hath made me &s;omewhat pro|lix, and what he may perhaps call over curious in &s;ettling this point of precedency; for &s;ince it may be &s;o ea&s;ily &s;ettled and adju&s;ted from au|thentic records, it would have been an unpardonable omi&s;&s;ion in me to have neglected it; &s;eeing every one of tho&s;e cities do &s;till value them|&s;elves upon their rank, and have taken all po&s;&s;ible pains to find out all the old monuments that would both &s;upport and advance their re&s;pective claims.</P>
<P>I know that &s;ome annali&s;ts, in order to fill up the cha&s;m of <HI>nine</HI> years, have &s;uppos'd that <HI>Jen&s;on</HI> went from <HI>Venice</HI> to <HI>Paris,</HI> where he taught the Art of Printing, and &s;et up &s;ome pre&s;&s;es, and in&s;tructed &s;everal, who became eminent Printers. But this is improbable on many accounts; 1. Becau&s;e there are none of his works done at <HI>Paris;</HI> 2. Becau&s;e his cha|racter is much finer than any us'd in <HI>France</HI> by the fir&s;t Printers there; 3. Becau&s;e he would have met with &s;uch encouragement there, e&s;peci|ally con&s;idering it was his native country, that there had been no occa|&s;ion to return to <HI>Venice; la&s;tly,</HI> becau&s;e, if he had taught &s;o many &s;kil|ful workmen in the Art, of which him&s;elf was then by far the greate&s;t ma&s;ter, it would have been unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;end for the three partners out of <HI>Germany,</HI> who did not however come to that city 'till about the year 1469, that is, <HI>&s;ix</HI> or <HI>&s;even</HI> years after his &s;uppos'd coming thither. To this we may add, that upon this &s;uppo&s;ition the Art mu&s;t have been brought to <HI>Paris,</HI> &s;everal years &s;ooner than the mo&s;t authentick records, and the be&s;t writers allow, which &s;eems as improbable; as it is difficult to a&s;&s;ign a place where <HI>Jen&s;on</HI> printed this work.

<HEAD>CHAP. I. The City of <HI>Mentz,</HI> Mona&s;tery of <HI>Subiaco,</HI> and the City of <HI>Ausburgh.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect;. 1. <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> and <HI>Schoeffer</HI> continue to print at <HI>Mentz,</HI> after the Di&s;per&s;ion of mo&s;t of their Servants, and the taking of that City.</HEAD>
<P>IF tho&s;e cities which gave the earlie&s;t invitations and encouragements to the Art of Printing, do &s;o ju&s;tly merit to be recorded in their re|&s;pective ranks, that of <HI>Mentz</HI> certainly de&s;erves to be placed at the head of them, upon two accounts; 1. becau&s;e it was the mother and inventre&s;s of it; and 2. becau&s;e it &s;till continued to promote and cheri&s;h it, after it had been reduc'd to a foreign yoke. In the fir&s;t book we con&s;ider'd her in the former view, whil&s;t &s;he was the only one in the world, that engro&s;s'd both the Art and Arti&s;ts to her&s;elf: but the conqueror's &s;word was the occa&s;ion of its being di&s;pers'd through the mo&s;t eminent cities of <HI>Europe:</HI> 'till this time the be&s;t of <HI>Fau&s;t's</HI> &s;ervants being tyed by an oath of &s;ecrecy, and perhaps by &s;ome more powerful engagement, had not dar'd to for|&s;ake their ma&s;ter; and if &s;ome few had ventur'd to break through their en|gagements, yet were they &s;till &s;o imperfectly acquainted with the Art, that they never perform'd any work that could abide the te&s;t of time, if we except <HI>N. Jen&s;on</HI>'s: but now as the city was depriv'd of its freedom and pri|vileges, it aboli&s;h'd the difference between ma&s;ter and &s;ervant, citizen and foreigner; they began to look upon them&s;elves as free from all former ties, and at liberty to accept of the invitations which they receiv'd from <HI>England, Italy, France,</HI> &amp;c. &s;o that in the &s;pace of very few years, there was &s;carce a metropolis or con&s;iderable city, where there was not one or more Printing-hou&s;es &s;et up: &s;everal mona&s;teries likewi&s;e began to entertain tho&s;e fugitives very early, as we &s;hall &s;how anon; and wherever any of tho&s;e workmen chanc'd to &s;ettle them&s;elves, they did not fail of meeting
<PB N="116" REF="127">
with all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and encouragement, which the mo&s;t eminent men either for power or learning could give them. However as they cannot be &s;uppos'd to have been all men of equal capacity and indu&s;try, &s;o we need not wonder if they did not &s;ignalize them&s;elves every where alike; but whil&s;t one &s;ort of them did in a &s;hort &s;pace improve the Art to a very con&s;iderable degree, others of a more &s;luggi&s;h nature, contented them|&s;elves with going on in their old way, and &s;ome of them even from bad to wor&s;e.</P>
<P>WE need not doubt but that <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> and <HI>Schoeffer,</HI> during this &s;ad inter|val, were as much courted by other nations to leave <HI>Mentz,</HI> and betake them&s;elves to a place of greater tranquillity, and in a more flouri&s;hing &s;tate: but their love to their native city, which had favour'd them &s;o much in its pro&s;perity, prevail'd upon them to continue there, and to car|ry on their bu&s;ine&s;s, as before. This is apparent from the li&s;t of their works, given in the fir&s;t book; and the edition of the great <HI>Bible</HI> which they printed in this very year, with that of <HI>Tully</HI>'s <HI>Offices three</HI> years af|ter, gives ground to &s;uppo&s;e, that the merit of this invention procur'd them &s;ome particular regard and privilege from Archbi&s;hop <HI>Adolph,</HI> as &s;oon as it became known to him; which might induce them to go on with the bu&s;ine&s;s, as they had done formerly: however if they printed nothing between the year 1462 and 1465, (as we don't as yet find that they did) we may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, that the confu&s;ion in which the city then was, might ob&s;truct it for that time, &s;ince we don't find &s;uch a length of time between any of their other works: the truth is, we have very few or no particulars concerning them, except what we have given in the fir&s;t book, wherein I endeavour'd as well as I could to trace <HI>Fau&s;t</HI>'s hi&s;tory to the end of his life. All that we can add concerning <HI>Peter Schoeffer,</HI> is, that he continued printing &s;everal con&s;iderable volumes 'till the year 1479, which he then &s;ub&s;crib'd with his own name, and to &s;ome of which (towards the latter end of his life) he added his coat of arms, which might in all probability have been given to him either by the Archbi|&s;hop or &s;ome crown'd head: accordingly we find the&s;e words added to his colophons, <HI>Suis con&s;ignando &s;cutis,</HI> that they were mark'd with his own arms. He left a &s;on <HI>John Schoeffer,</HI> who became likewi&s;e an ex|cellent Printer at <HI>Mentz;</HI> but he mu&s;t in all likelihood have been very
<PB N="117" REF="128">
young when his father dy'd, &s;eeing we find nothing printed by him 'till <HI>ann.</HI> 1503, when he acquainted his readers in the colophons to his fir&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ions, that he was the &s;on of <HI>Peter Schoeffer</HI> and grand&s;on to <HI>J. Fau&s;t, &amp;c.</HI> the fir&s;t inventors of the Art; and that him&s;elf was an excellent ma&s;ter of it, and an eminent citizen <HI>(primarius civis)</HI> of the metropolis of <HI>Mentz,</HI> but as this is beyond my propos'd epocha, I &s;hall &s;ay no more of him.</P>
<P>I don't find any other Printer in the city of <HI>Mentz,</HI> during <HI>Peter Schoeffer</HI>'s life: about 1480, we meet with one &s;ingle work of no great con&s;e|quence done there by one <HI>Erhard Rewick,</HI> and between the year 1470 and 1500, there are about <HI>fifteen</HI> impre&s;&s;ions printed there without any Printer's name; and therefore are &s;uppos'd to have been done by &s;ome of <HI>Fau&s;t</HI>'s &s;ervants, who dared not put their names to them, whil&s;t <HI>Schoeffer</HI> and his &s;on liv'd.</P>
<P>THO' I do not de&s;ign to &s;well the following book with a li&s;t of the works done in every city, it having been done by the indefatigable Mr. <HI>Mat|taire</HI> and father <HI>Orlandi,</HI> but only to give my readers an account of the mo&s;t eminent Printers, that have &s;ignaliz'd them&s;elves in any of them, with the names and dates of the le&s;s con&s;iderable ones; yet I hope the reader will forgive me, if my re&s;pect for <HI>P. Schoeffer,</HI> who&s;e works are &s;o much valued by the curious, as well for their antiquity, as for their elegance, correctne&s;s, and tho&s;e ornaments, which he &s;till caus'd the illuminators to be&s;tow on them to the la&s;t, induces me to &s;ubjoin a li&s;t of them; they are as follows, with their colophons.</P>

<P>SOON after <HI>Ausburgh</HI> had receiv'd the Art of Printing, it was brought to <HI>Rome</HI> by two Germans, <HI>Conrard Sweynheim</HI> and <HI>Arnold Pannarts;</HI> who &s;et up a printing-hou&s;e there <HI>anno</HI> 1466, the &s;econd year
<PB N="123" REF="134">
of the pontificate of <HI>Paul</HI> II. under the patronage of <HI>John Andreas</HI> Bi|&s;hop of <HI>Aleria,</HI> who was the Popes library-keeper, ju&s;tly fam'd for his learning and genero&s;ity. The&s;e printers a&s;&s;i&s;ted with that prelates pur&s;e, did immediately prepare an elegant, round, <HI>Roman</HI> character, and a &s;uffi|cient quantity of the fine&s;t paper; they invented likewi&s;e &s;uch variety of &s;paces, as kept a beautiful di&s;tance between the words, and made their impre&s;&s;ions appear with the greate&s;t neatne&s;s and exactne&s;s. Their mar|gins were broad, and not only added a grace to the pages, but render|ed them likewi&s;e convenient for the writing of notes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and their ink was &s;o excellent, that it &s;till looks as fre&s;h as if newly printed. In &s;hort, they were per&s;ons who valu'd their credit, and the honour of plea&s;ing their patron more than riches; and &s;par'd neither co&s;t nor labour, in order to make their impre&s;&s;ions as beautiful and correct, as po&s;&s;ible; which any one that has &s;een them, will own with plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>I doubt not but the great acquaintance among&s;t the learned, which their noble patron's friend&s;hip procur'd them, might be a great means of their improving the art to &s;uch a degree; &s;eeing &s;uch per&s;ons were be&s;t able to di&s;cover the faults and inconveniences of the fir&s;t printed books, which the&s;e <HI>Germans</HI> might more ea&s;ily rectify when they became ac|quainted with them. The&s;e two partners &s;ettled them&s;elves in the hou&s;e of <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Francis de Maximis,</HI> brothers and Roman knights; where the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Aleria</HI> not only furni&s;h'd them with the mo&s;t valuable manu&s;cripts, out of the <HI>Vatican</HI> and other libraties, but al&s;o prepar'd them him&s;elf, corrected their proofs, and prefix'd prefaces and de|dications to their works, in order to recommend them the more to the learned world. This laborious ta&s;k was follow'd by him with &s;uch application, that he &s;carce allow'd him&s;elf time to &s;leep. What a value this great Bi&s;hop had both for the art and the&s;e two great ma&s;ters of it, appears from his dedication to Pope <HI>Paul</HI> II. prefix'd to the edition of St. <HI>Jerom</HI>'s <HI>Epi&s;tles,</HI> which I &s;hall now give the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> reader a tran&s;lati|on of. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It was, &s;ays he, in your days, that among many other divine favours this ble&s;&s;ing was be&s;tow'd on the Chri&s;tian world, that every poor &s;cholar can purcha&s;e for him&s;elf a library for a &s;mall &s;um,&mdash;that tho&s;e volumes, which heretofore could &s;carce be bought for an hundred crowns, may now be procur'd for le&s;s than twenty, very well

<P>THUS were the&s;e two printers care&s;s'd and encourag'd by mo&s;t of the men of letters and fortune at <HI>Rome,</HI> and even by the Pope him&s;elf, who frequently vi&s;ited their Printing-hou&s;e, and examin'd with admiration every branch of this new art; which &s;eem'd de&s;ign'd to recover learn|ing, and re&s;tore that city to its antient lu&s;tre. This excited them to approve them&s;elves worthy of all that e&s;teem, which was &s;hew'd them, by publi&s;hing a va&s;t number of elegant impre&s;&s;ions, &s;ome of which were &s;o large that they could not be done without great labor and charges, as will be evident from the li&s;t of their works, which they pre&s;ented to the Pope, of which we &s;hall give an account in its proper place.</P>
<P>WHAT their fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion was, whether <HI>Cicero</HI>'s <HI>Familiar Epi&s;tles,</HI> or St. <HI>Au&s;tin</HI>'s book <HI>de Civitate Dei,</HI> is what authors can by no means agree about; that the former was printed at <HI>Rome ann.</HI> 1467, with a latin epi|gram, at the end of which their names are at full length; and on the fol|lowing year, a new edition of St. <HI>Au&s;tin</HI>'s book <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Anno igitur eodem 1468, opus <HI>Augu&s;tini de Civitate Dei</HI> eruditi&s;&s;imum; <HI>Epi&s;tolas Hiero|nymi</HI> di&s;erti&s;&s;imas, cum luminibus orationis tum viribus argumentorum in&s;tructas vulgaverunt.&mdash;Anno &s;uperiore <HI>Tullianas</HI> dederant <HI>Epi&s;|tolas,</HI> hoc dant <HI>Hieronymianas,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Annal.

<P>I have already hinted their method of managing the <HI>Greek</HI> quotations, which they follow'd in the fir&s;t volumes they printed, that is 'till the middle of the year 1469: perhaps were they forc'd to it for want of work|men to cut the <HI>Greek</HI> alphabet; but at length, notwith&s;tanding the neg|lect of that tongue might have excus'd them from the labour and expence of procuring &s;etts of punches and matrices for Printing in that language, and the difficulty of finding workmen fit for &s;uch a task, they &s;urmoun|ted every ob&s;tacle of this nature, and form'd a compleat <HI>Greek</HI> alphabet, which they us'd in the edition of <HI>Aulus Gellius.</HI> Concerning this edition the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Aleria</HI> &s;peaks thus; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"However, this prov'd a very ardu|ous ta&s;k at fir&s;t;&mdash;for a great part of the <HI>Latin</HI> was corrupted thro' the negligence of the tran&s;cribers; and a much greater part of the <HI>Greek</HI> deprav'd, maim'd, and mutilated.

The quotations, which are long and more frequent, than in any other author, are printed in a fair <HI>Greek</HI> character, con&s;idering this kind of printing was but in its infancy; and what is extremely remarka|ble, they were &s;o correctly printed, that, as we are a&s;&s;ur'd by Mr. <HI>Mat|taire,</HI> in two whole pages, which contain'd &s;eventy &s;ix lines of a con&s;ide|rable length, there were but <HI>fourteen</HI> faults of impre&s;&s;ion.

HITHER TO we have &s;een the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of this pre&s;s, which in the &s;pace of &s;ix or &s;even years at mo&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> from <HI>ann.</HI> 1467 to 1472, oblig'd the world with no le&s;s than twelve thou&s;and four hundred and &s;e|venty five volumes, in eight and twenty editions, &s;ome of them very large, and all beautiful and correct; &s;o that if their va&s;t labours and co&s;t had met with &s;uitable &s;ucce&s;s, they mu&s;t have rais'd a prodigious e&s;tate. But, whatever be the cau&s;e, 'tis certain that the greate&s;t part of this li|brary remain'd &s;till in their hands for want of buyers; which reduc'd them to the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;itous circum&s;tances. Father <HI>Orlandi</HI> endeavours to account for this ill-&s;ucce&s;s, by &s;uppo&s;ing that their impre&s;&s;ions, being in Roman character, were di&s;lik'd in tho&s;e days, becau&s;e the learned had been &s;o accu&s;tom'd to the old Gothick, as not to approve of this new, tho' preferable one. This conjecture &s;eems the more probable upon two accounts; 1. Becau&s;e &s;everal eminent printers were oblig'd to com|ply with the ta&s;t of the age, and u&s;e the old character, re&s;embling that of MSS. 2. Mo&s;t of the fir&s;t Printers of <HI>Paris, Venice, Rome,</HI> &amp;c. who began with the Roman, were forc'd by degrees to re&s;ume the old Go|thick, which continu'd till almo&s;t the middle of the next century, and prov'd the ruin of many valuable impre&s;&s;ions in divers parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> However that be, our two <HI>Germans</HI> under the&s;e pre&s;&s;ing exigencies had recour&s;e to their great patron, who immediately drew up a petition in their names and behalf to Pope <HI>Xy&s;tus</HI> IV, &s;ubjoin'd to the fifth volume of <HI>Nich. de Lyra</HI>'s <HI>Glo&s;&s;.</HI> and pre&s;ented on the 20th of <HI>March</HI> 1472. In this he repre&s;ents their great merit and mi&s;ery in the mo&s;t pathetick terms imaginable; gives a catalogue of all the volumes printed by them, the greate&s;t part of which was &s;till un&s;old; prays his Holine&s;s to con&s;ider their deplorable ca&s;e; and declares their readine&s;s to deliver up the un|&s;old books either to him, or to whom&s;oever he &s;hould command, for their pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;tance. The Bi&s;hop, to &s;hew that he was &s;en&s;ibly touch'd with their misfortune, prefaceth the petition in his own name, and reque&s;ts the Pope to hear the ju&s;t complaint of his worthy and in|du&s;trious Printers; and afterwards expo&s;es their circum&s;tances in their own words. As this curious piece has never yet, that I know of, been tran&s;lated into <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> I pre&s;ume the reader will be pleas'd to &s;ee it, with the promis'd li&s;t of their works, both which they printed with the

that the <HI>Gauls</HI> or <HI>French</HI> being di&s;cover'd by the noi&s;e of the gee&s;e one night in their attempt to &s;urprize the <HI>Roman</HI> Capitol, a countryman of theirs had found out a way to be reveng'd of them, by teaching the world an art of writing without the help of their quills.

<P>MICH.

But in this he did no more than what was frequent among the <HI>Germans</HI> and others, who to &s;often the har&s;hne&s;s of their &s;irnames, either alter'd or latiniz'd them; &s;o <HI>Fu&s;t</HI> chang'd his into <HI>Fau&s;tus, Schoeffer</HI> into <HI>Opilio, Leichten&s;tein</HI> into <HI>Le|vi lapis, des Rouges</HI> into <HI>de Rubeis,</HI> and the learned <HI>Stephens</HI> into <HI>Stephanus;</HI> which cu&s;tom &s;till prevails in foreign parts: and the famous Mon&s;. <HI>le Clerc</HI> of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> &s;tiles him&s;elf <HI>Joan.

<P>THE time of his fir&s;t coming to <HI>Rome</HI> is not ea&s;ily determin'd. Some affirm that he was &s;ettled there before <HI>Sweynheim</HI> and <HI>Pannartz,</HI> as <HI>Wimpheling, Mon&s;.

Becau&s;e the Bp. of <HI>Aleria,</HI> who was the editor of all the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions of the&s;e, determines in their favour; and his te&s;timony is of much greater weight in this ca&s;e, than that of

tho&s;e writers. He attributes <HI>the honour to</HI> Sweynheim, <HI>&amp;c. of having founded the fir&s;t Printing-hou&s;e at</HI> Rome, <HI>and brought the Art from</HI> Germany, <HI>in the preceding Popes reign, and by their example encourag'd others to do the like;</HI> as he &s;peaks in the petition to <HI>Xy&s;tus</HI> IV, above quoted.

The merit of this Printer appears from his fine impre&s;&s;ions, and the choice that his patron made of him to publi&s;h tho&s;e works, which he had procur'd and corrected with the utmo&s;t application, as well as from the prai&s;es, which he gives him in his prefatory epi&s;tles and ver&s;es. We find by the li&s;t of his books, that he frequently neglected the date of the impre&s;&s;ion and his own name. The former defect is &s;upplied, as far as po&s;&s;ible, from &s;ome material circum&s;tances, either in the epi&s;tles affix'd to them, or el&s;ewhere in the book; and the latter by a diligent compar|ing of one edition with another; for there is &s;ome peculiar difference between the characters of the fir&s;t Printers, by which a nice ob&s;erver may judge of the author.</P>

<P>AS the city of <HI>Venice</HI> has excelled all others, not only in the num|ber of workmen and editions, but likewi&s;e in the goodne&s;s and excellency of them, I &s;hall be forc'd to divide it into two chapters; in the fir&s;t of which I &s;hall &s;peak of tho&s;e Printers who flouri&s;h'd from its fir&s;t &s;ettlement there by <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Vindelin de Spira,</HI> to the time of the great <HI>Aldus Manutius,</HI> who&s;e merit alone will very well de&s;erve to be &s;poken of in a chapter by it &s;elf, tho' there were no others to bear him company in it.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to tho&s;e fir&s;t Printers, 'twill be &s;uperfluous to repeat here what I have &s;aid, in the introduction of this book, concerning

<HI>Nich.

In the mean time I beg leave to remind the reader of the remark upon this head, which we ju&s;t hinted in the intro|duction, <HI>viz.</HI> that the ver&s;es at the end of the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion by <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Windelin</HI> of <HI>Spire ann.</HI> 1469, evidently prove them to have been the fir&s;t who brought the Art to that city.

For my part I can't &s;ee any nece&s;&s;ity of accu&s;ing either &s;ide of &s;uch a fault, &s;eeing they never charg'd each other with it; be&s;ides <HI>Jen&s;on</HI> in all probabi|lity printed his book &s;omewhere el&s;e, and therefore might indeed be too mode&s;t when he came to <HI>Venice,</HI> to challenge the priority from them as to that place in particular. However, as to the point of mode&s;ty, I own I am at a lo&s;s to what &s;ide to give it, &s;eeing all the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, both of <HI>Jen&s;on</HI> and of the two brothers, are back'd with epigrams equally mag|nificent, and I don't &s;ee where there would have been the lea&s;t immode&s;ty in either to have a&s;certain'd a ju&s;t claim, again&s;t an unju&s;t a&s;&s;uming ri|val. Let me add, that (if there was any wilfull mi&s;take on either &s;ide, which I think there was not) it is more probable <HI>Jen&s;on</HI> &s;hould have com|mitted it, than the two brothers; becau&s;e he might ea&s;ily, if there was occa&s;ion, excu&s;e it by making his date pa&s;s for an error of impre&s;&s;ion; whereas the two <HI>Germans</HI> publi&s;h'd them&s;elves, in words at length and
<PB N="142" REF="153">
in the plaine&s;t terms, the fir&s;t Printers at <HI>Venice,</HI> and &s;o left no room for eva&s;ion. I &s;hall therefore begin with them, who were not inferior to <HI>Jen&s;on</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P><LABEL>JOHN and VINDELINE of SPIRE, 1469.</LABEL>
THEY were natives of <HI>Germany,</HI> but whether of the city of <HI>Spire,</HI> who&s;e name they bear, or whether that was only their &s;irname, I can|not determine; for tho' &s;ome of the epigrams annex'd to their books &s;eem to imply the former, yet it is difficult to affirm certainly that it was not a poetical licence, which, in this ca&s;e, might have been more excu&s;able than that of <HI>Campanus</HI> upon <HI>Ulric Han,</HI> mention'd in the pre|ceding chapter.

<P>THESE two brothers &s;oon &s;urpa&s;s'd all their predece&s;&s;ors in the beauty and neatne&s;s of their characters, and the elegance of their impre&s;&s;ions, which to this time render them admir'd and e&s;teem'd by the curious, a|bove all other ancient editions. <HI>Venice</HI> by this gain'd &s;o much reputation for the finene&s;s of her types, that &s;ome eminent Printers at <HI>Rome</HI> and el&s;ewhere either furni&s;h'd them&s;elves with &s;etts of them, or endeavour'd to imitate them, acquainting their readers in their next impre&s;&s;ions, that they were printed <HI>characteribus Venetianis,</HI> with <HI>Venetian</HI> types. <HI>Chevilli|er</HI> indeed thinks this to have been an impo&s;ition upon the world; nor can it be denied but that &s;ome of them pretended this, in order to re|commend their own wretched performances. But this demon&s;trates the &s;uperior merit of that city, and the laudable emulation of her Printers, not only to excell tho&s;e of other places, but even one another. And in|deed the&s;e two brothers with <HI>John de Cologn</HI> and <HI>N.

NICH.

Whereas were the &s;uppo&s;ition of tho&s;e, who think it antedated by <HI>ten</HI> years, to be allow'd, it will be manife&s;t that there had already been &s;everal eminent Printers at <HI>Rome, Venice,</HI> and el&s;ewhere before him, who introduc'd that noble and elegant character; and that tho' his &s;hould be allow'd to be &s;omewhat finer than tho&s;e of his predece&s;&s;ors, yet would his merit be inferior to theirs, and his improve|ment upon them be but &s;mall in compari&s;on of that, which they made upon the old <HI>Moguntine</HI> types.

THESE two <HI>Germans</HI> came and &s;ettled at <HI>Venice,</HI> &s;oon after the two <HI>Spires,</HI> and were equal to any of their contemporaries, in the beauty of their Roman types, the finene&s;s of their paper, and elegance and cor|rectne&s;s of their works.

<P>ALDUS MANUTIUS, the mo&s;t eminent Printer of the fifteenth century, was born <HI>anno</HI> 1445, when Printing was yet in its in|tancy; who as he grew up, became &s;uch an admirer of this new Art,
<PB N="152" REF="163">
that tho' his education, learning and genius might have ju&s;tly excited him to greater employments, yet he cho&s;e to devote his whole time and &s;tudy to the cultivating and improving all the branches of it. This de|&s;ign he perform'd with &s;uch indefatigable application and va&s;t cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ges, that his whole ambition &s;eem'd to be confin'd to this province and the advancement of learning <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Omnem enim vitam decrevimus ad ho|minum utilitatem con&s;umere&mdash;nam et&s;i qui|etam ac tranquillam agere vitam po&s;&s;umus, ne|gotio&s;am tamen eligimus &amp; plenam laboribus. <HI>Ald. p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">afat. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d La&s;car. Creten.</HI></NOTE>. After he had receiv'd the rudiments of Grammar, under <HI>Ga&s;par</HI> of <HI>Verona,</HI> he apply'd him&s;elf to the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> tongues under the great <HI>Bapti&s;ta Guarini</HI> of <HI>Verona;</HI> and in a &s;hort time made &s;uch a progre&s;s in the&s;e languages, as not only to &s;urpa&s;s his fellow &s;tudents, but even to rival his ma&s;ter him&s;elf. Thus he conti|nued furni&s;hing his mind with every part of literature, in order to fit him&s;elf for that bu&s;ine&s;s, of which he was afterwards to become the or|nament. The war breaking out in <HI>Italy,</HI> and the city of <HI>Ferrara</HI> being be&s;ieged, he removed from thence to <HI>Mirandula,</HI> where he became ac|quainted with the great <HI>Picus</HI> of that name, a prince of the brighte&s;t genius that age had produc'd, and one of the greate&s;t l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">vers of learning, and of learned men, who not only receiv'd him with open arms, but procur'd him the acquaintance of many learned men, by who&s;e conver|&s;ation and corre&s;pondence, <HI>Aldus</HI> receiv'd no &s;mall advantage toward the acquiring that great knowledge of the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Tongues, which he became afterwards &s;o famous for. In the 45th year of his age, <HI>anno</HI> 1490, he began to prepare the nece&s;&s;ary <HI>apparatus</HI> of a Printing|hou&s;e, wherein he &s;pent <HI>four</HI> years, and con&s;equently did not begin Printing till about <HI>anno</HI> 1494. During this interval he ob&s;erv'd with regret to what degree the abbreviations, us'd by all the former Printers every where, were multiply'd; &s;o that they became unintelligible, with|out &s;ome key to direct the reader, an in&s;tance of which is given in the margin <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><P>This curious example of the abbreviations, us'd in tho&s;e times, is extracted from <HI>Okam</HI>'s logick, folio ver&s;o, leaf 121, as follows;</P>
<P>Si&cmbtilde; hic &egr;&cmbtilde; f&agr;&cmbtilde;l s&cmbtilde; m q&cmbtilde;d <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d &s;implr&cmbtilde; &agr;&cmbtilde; e p&cmbtilde;ducibile a deo g&cmbtilde; &agr;&cmbtilde; &egr;&cmbtilde; &amp; s lr&cmbtilde; hic a n&cmbtilde; &egr;&cmbtilde; g&cmbtilde; a &agr;&cmbtilde; &egr;&cmbtilde; p&cmbtilde;ducibile a deo &amp;c. which words printed at full length, will run thus; <HI>Sicut hic e&s;t fallacia &s;ecundum quid ad &s;impliciter, A e&s;t producibile a deo. Ergo A e&s;t, &amp; &s;im liter hic. A non e&s;t, ergo non e&s;t producibile a deo.</HI> Vide Chevil p. 110.</P>
<P>The&s;e abbreviations were grown in time &s;o numerous and univer&s;al, that books were ob|lig'd to be publi&s;h'd to teach the method of reading and under&s;tanding them.</P></NOTE>. Upon this, he con&s;ider'd a method to remedy this inconve|nience,
<PB N="153" REF="164">
and &s;et them quite a&s;ide in his editions. But becau&s;e the print|ing the words at length would enlarge the volumes a fourth part, (for there was &s;carce one word in five that was not abridg'd) and encrea&s;e the price; he re&s;olv'd likewi&s;e to remedy that. To which end he invented the <HI>Italick</HI> character, call'd from him <HI>Aldine,</HI> or <HI>Cur&s;ivus</HI> and <HI>Cancella|rius,</HI> from its re&s;emblance to hand-writing; which by-its figure and clo&s;ene&s;s, gain'd as much upon the round Roman, as the abbreviations did, and reduc'd the volume to near an exact bulk, thereby rendering them ab&s;olutely u&s;ele&s;s. This is the main, tho' not the &s;ole advantage, which he propos'd by this new character; for the world has &s;ince found its extraordinary u&s;efulne&s;s in many other re&s;pects; which being obvious to every per&s;on, I &s;hall not particulari&s;e here, but mention only the agree|ablene&s;s of a mixture of Roman and Italick. However, it mu&s;t be own'd, that <HI>Aldus</HI> made too great u&s;e of the latter, in printing whole volumes in that character, which is known to tire the eyes much more than the Ro|man. Upon this account &s;everal emineat Printers afterwards rejected it in their quotations, when they were of any con&s;iderable length, and &s;ub&s;tituted Double comma's or Guillemets at one end of the lines, to di|&s;tingui&s;h the citations from the body of the book: which Guillemets were &s;o call'd from their Inventor, a <HI>French</HI> Printer of that name.</P>
<P>To return to <HI>Aldus;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s &s;oon as he had per&s;ected this new character, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily co&s;t him prodigious &s;umms of money, he obtain'd a privilege from three &s;everal Popes, for the &s;ole u&s;e of them during the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">e of <HI>fifteen</HI> years; and the&s;e pontifs give him great encomiums upon the account of this invention.

<P>'TIS apparent from the tenour of the&s;e briefs, that this Italick character was not the only particular, wherein <HI>Aldus</HI> &s;ignaliz'd him&s;elf; for the number and correctne&s;s of his editions, with the beauty of his characters, gain'd him the e&s;teem and admiration of the learned; nor need I tell the reader how highly all his works have been valued ever &s;ince, as well as tho&s;e of his &s;on <HI>Paulus Manucius,</HI> of his &s;on-in-law <HI>Andreas Azolanus,</HI> and his grand&s;on <HI>Aldus;</HI> which are of equal merit with his own, and of equal value. His ambition of being e&s;teem'd not only a man of letters, (as he really was,) but al&s;o the mo&s;t correct Printer of the age, was &s;uch, that he &s;par'd no co&s;t in procuring the be&s;t MSS, nor labour in revi&s;ing them; and his care was &s;o great, le&s;t any errors &s;hould e&s;cape him either in the M S. or proofs, that, as we are a&s;&s;ur'd by <HI>Angel.

However that be, his accuracy and diligence is unque&s;tionably atte&s;ted by all the learned; and he tells Pope <HI>Leo</HI> X, in his petition beforemention'd, that the height of his ambition was to pre|&s;ent the world with authors, corrected with the utmo&s;t exactne&s;s; and that nothing was more mortifying to him, than to &s;ee any faults in his im|pre&s;&s;ions, <HI>every one of which he would gladly, if po&s;&s;ible, have redeem'd at the price of a crown of gold</HI> <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Sic doleo, ut, &s;i po&s;&s;em, mutarem &s;ingula errata nummo aureo.</NOTE>. What a&s;&s;i&s;tance he had from the learned in correcting his books may be gather'd from his preface to the <HI>Greek</HI> edi|tion of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s <HI>Logick,</HI> where he a&s;&s;ures us, <HI>that he had &s;ome of the able&s;t criticks with him, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the correction;</HI> and in the preface to the <HI>phy|&s;icks</HI> of that philo&s;opher, he boa&s;ts, <HI>that his impre&s;&s;ions were more perfect and correct than the very originals from which they were printed</HI> <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Dicere queo, quicquid meo labore formis excuditur, ip&s;is exemplaribus longe correctius ac magis perfectum exire ex aedibus no&s;tris.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT it mu&s;t be own'd that the learned are far from granting him this la&s;t piece of merit, which he challenges; and &s;ome of them have obje|cted, that he either printed them not according to the be&s;t manu&s;cripts, or corrected them by his own conjectures, or follow'd &s;ometimes too &s;cru|pulou&s;ly tho&s;e which were faulty and imperfect. Upon this account <HI>Era&s;|mus,</HI> tho' a great friend of his, complains that <HI>Michael Bentius,</HI> who prin|ted his proverbs, <HI>had follow'd the corrupt editions of</HI> Aldus <HI>in the quotati|ons from</HI> Homer <HI>and</HI> Cicero <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Nam <HI>Michael Bentius</HI> contulit quaedam loca a me citata ex Graeco <HI>Homero</HI> ab <HI>Aldo</HI> excu&s;o, item ex <HI>Cicerone Aldino.</HI> cum <HI>Aldina</HI> &s;int depra|vati&s;&s;ima. <HI>Vita Era&s;mi, Lugdun.

him in another letter <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Officina Veneta dedit nobis <HI>Fe&s;tum Pompei|um</HI> egregie depravatum; non in&s;imulo <HI>Aldum;</HI> &s;olet ille tales operas alicui Paedagogo commit|tere.

And this, in all probability, is the rea&s;on why he thus expre&s;&s;es his di&s;&s;atisfaction at his own editions, in the petition to the Pope beforemention'd; <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Sed ego non credulus illis; nullum enim adhuc dedi librum, in quo mihi ip&s;i &s;atisfecerim.</NOTE> <HI>that he was &s;o far from regarding the flatteries of &s;ome per&s;ons, that he had not as yet pub|li&s;h'd one book, with which he could be &s;atisfied</HI> <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Sed ego non credulus illis; nullum enim adhuc dedi librum, in quo mihi ip&s;i &s;atisfecerim.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BESIDES this, he carries his complaints &s;till further, and inveighs loudly again&s;t two &s;orts of men, who alone are capable of depriving the learned world of the benefit of printing, unle&s;s &s;ome &s;peedy &s;top be put to their wretched performances: the fir&s;t are tho&s;e, who, notwith&s;tanding their notorious ignorance and incapacity, pre&s;ume to print any kind of books: the <HI>&s;econd</HI> are the half learned editors, who not only venture upon pub|li&s;hing ancient authors, but likewi&s;e write notes and commentaries with their own corrections upon them. Thus was this great man concern'd to &s;ee the corruptions already crept into the Art, thro' the avarice of &s;ome, and ignorance of others; whil&s;t him&s;elf found by &s;ad experience, that all his care, as well as learning, was &s;carce &s;ufficient for &s;uch a ta&s;k. As no Printer ever &s;urpa&s;s'd him in the latter, &s;o none ever equall'd him in the former; for &s;o indefatigable was he in that laborious province, that he &s;carce allow'd him&s;elf time to eat, &s;leep, or attend his dome&s;tick affairs; and, which is &s;till more, was &s;o regardle&s;s of his health, as to neglect tho&s;e plea&s;ures and recreations &s;o nece&s;&s;ary and conducive to the pre&s;ervation of it. The learned <HI>Zuinger,</HI> in his <HI>Theatrum vitae humanae</HI> p. 3713 of the <HI>Ba&s;il</HI> edition 1604, tells us, that his mind was entirely enga|ged in the care of his Printing-hou&s;e; that, as &s;oon as he had order'd his other nece&s;&s;ary affairs, he &s;hut him&s;elf up in his &s;tudy, where he employ'd him&s;elf in revi&s;ing his <HI>greek</HI> and <HI>latin</HI> manu&s;cripts, reading the letters which he receiv'd from the learned out of all parts of the world, and writing

<P>ALDUS is affirm'd by many authors to have been the fir&s;t who printed whole volumes in <HI>greek,</HI> particularly the learned <HI>Henry Stephens,</HI> a&s;&s;erts, both in the <HI>Complaint of the Art of Printing</HI> written by him, and in his epitaph upon <HI>Aldus,</HI> that he was the fir&s;t Printer in that language <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Qui graphicis primus tradidit illa typis.</NOTE>; and <HI>Ge&s;ner</HI> tells <HI>Paul Manutius Aldus</HI>'s &s;on, in the 11th book of his Pandects, that if he is not mi&s;taken, there were no <HI>greek</HI> books printed before tho&s;e of his father, or at lea&s;t, not with equal beauty and correctne&s;s with his <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Exemplaria Graeca ante patrem tuum aut nulla, ni <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">allor, aut pauca, nec ea indu&s;tria typis pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">licata &s;unt.</NOTE>. Tho' this is not &s;trictly true, as we &s;hall immediately &s;hew, yet as he was the greate&s;t Printer in <HI>greek,</HI> and inventor of a beautiful character, the&s;e and &s;everal other authors might ea&s;ily attribute to him the fir&s;t rank in this province. The fir&s;t <HI>greek</HI> book was publi&s;h'd by him, <HI>anno</HI> 1494, as appears by the li&s;ts, which the annali&s;ts give us of his works, and from what <HI>Aldus</HI> him&s;elf &s;ays, in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> preface to <HI>Stephanus de urbibus, anno</HI> 1502 <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Eodem anno, quo vexari bello coepit <HI>Italia,</HI> difficillimam hanc ego imprimendorum libro|rum provinciam accepi.</NOTE>, that he begun his fir&s;t <HI>greek</HI> impre&s;&s;ions in the year wherein the war in <HI>Italy</HI> commenc'd, <HI>viz. anno</HI> 1494, at the time of the expedition of <HI>Charles</HI> VIII king of <HI>France</HI> to &s;eize upon the kingdom of <HI>Naples.</HI> Some writers, from a mi&s;taken pa&s;&s;age in his preface to <HI>Ari&s;totle, anno</HI> 1495, wherein he tells his patron Prince <HI>Carpi,</HI> that he pre&s;ents him with the prince of phi|lo&s;ophers, <HI>Plato</HI> excepted, now fir&s;t printed and very correct, have thought

it to have been his fir&s;t <HI>greek</HI> impre&s;&s;ion; whereas he publi&s;h'd at lea&s;t <HI>three</HI> the year before. However 'tis plain he had printed no book in any language before <HI>anno</HI> 1494.</P>
<P>IT appears from what has been &s;aid in a former chapter concerning the <HI>Lactantius</HI> printed in the mona&s;tery of <HI>Subiaco, anno</HI> 1465, the <HI>Gellius</HI> at <HI>Rome</HI> 1469, and others, that &s;everal con&s;iderable fragments were printed in <HI>greek</HI> with no &s;mall elegancy and correctne&s;s. But be&s;ides the&s;e there were &s;everal editions in that language printed in divers cities of <HI>Italy</HI> &s;ome years before; the principal of which we &s;hall mention.</P>
<P>THE <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> as yet known, is the <HI>greek</HI> grammar of <HI>Con&s;tantine La&s;caris</HI> 4to, revis'd by <HI>Demetrius Creten&s;is,</HI> and printed by <HI>Diony&s;ius Palavi&s;inus</HI> at <HI>Milan, anno</HI> 1476, afterwards reprinted at <HI>Venice</HI> by <HI>Leonard</HI> of <HI>Ba&s;il, anno</HI> 1488.</P>
<P>THE next is the <HI>greek</HI> p&s;alter printed at <HI>Venice, anno</HI> 1486 by <HI>Alexander</HI> of <HI>Crete</HI> 4to, and <HI>Homer</HI>'s <HI>Batrachomuomachia,</HI> or battle between the frogs and mice 4to, at <HI>Venice</HI> by <HI>Leonic</HI> of <HI>Crete</HI> in the &s;ame year. But as the&s;e may be e&s;teem'd only preludes or e&s;&s;ays in that language, we &s;hall come to a more con&s;iderable edition, <HI>viz.</HI> that of <HI>Homer</HI>'s works in <HI>greek,</HI> which <HI>B. Neril</HI> caus'd to be printed at <HI>Florence</HI> in a large <HI>folio, anno</HI> 1488 by <HI>Demetrius</HI> of <HI>Milan,</HI> a native of <HI>Crete.</HI> This excellent work I have &s;een in the curious library of the learned Dr. <HI>Mead,</HI> and I dare affirm that whoever examines the whitene&s;s and &s;trength of the paper, the finene&s;s of the character, the elegant di&s;po&s;ition of the matter, the exact di&s;tance between the lines, the large margin, and in &s;hort, the whole performance with its various ornaments, will ea&s;ily own it a ma&s;ter-piece in that kind. There was likewi&s;e a fine edition of <HI>I&s;ocrates</HI> printed at <HI>Milan</HI> in <HI>fol.</HI> by <HI>Henry German</HI> and <HI>Seba&s;tian ex Pontremulo, anno</HI> 1493, a year before any of <HI>Aldus</HI>'s impre&s;&s;ions appear'd.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, tho' he was not the fir&s;t <HI>greek</HI> Printer, yet no per&s;on ever &s;ignaliz'd him&s;elf more in that province than he, nor equall'd him in beauty, correctne&s;s and number of editions. Concerning the beauty of his <HI>greek</HI> characters, of which he is &s;aid to be the inventor, Mr. <HI>Mattaire</HI> tells us <HI>pag.</HI> 237, <HI>Annal. Typogr.</HI> that tho&s;e, in which he printed the <HI>P&s;alter, Ae&s;op, Ari&s;totle, Ari&s;tophanes,</HI> &amp;c. were &s;omewhat larger, rounder, more beautiful and elegant, adorn'd with frequent ligatures, which added no &s;mall
<PB N="159" REF="170">
beauty to his <HI>greek</HI> editions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Nor is this is the only particular, for which the learned world is &s;o much oblig'd to him; &s;ince his de&s;igns reach'd &s;till farther, and were an&s;wer'd to his great &s;atisfaction before his death, which happen'd <HI>anno</HI> 1515. He ob&s;erv'd, with no &s;mall regret, how much and how long the <HI>Greek</HI> tongue had been neglected; in order therefore to revive that noble language, and accu&s;tom the learned by de|grees to read nothing but the originals, he re&s;olv'd to publi&s;h mo&s;t of his books in <HI>Greek</HI> only. This &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that the olde&s;t men be|gan to acquaint them&s;elves with it, and as many youths engaged in the &s;tudy of that tongue, as of the <HI>Latin;</HI> which gave him &s;uch &s;en&s;ible plea|&s;ure, that he mentions it in &s;everal of his prefaces, and particularly in that prefix'd to <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s <HI>Logic,</HI> wherein he thus expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf: <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">No&s;tris vero temporibus multos licet vi|dere <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> hoc e&s;t, &s;enes in &s;enectute Graece di&s;cere.

<P>ALL his impre&s;&s;ions were not of that nature; for in &s;ome of them, printed before and afterwards, as <HI>Mu&s;aeus, Greek grammar, Proclus</HI>'s <HI>Sphaera,</HI> the works of <HI>Philo&s;tratus, Eu&s;ebius contra Hieroclem,</HI> &amp;c. he fir&s;t gave the whole <HI>Greek</HI> text, and then the <HI>Latin</HI> tran&s;lation.</P>
<P>SOON after this, he invented a method, entirely new, of printing the&s;e <HI>Greek</HI> editions with their tran&s;lations, which I do not find practis'd by any Printer &s;ince.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="171">
THEY were impos'd after &s;uch a manner, that the purcha&s;er might have them bound either with the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> &s;eparate, or with a leaf of the one, and a leaf of the other alternately; for in&s;tance, the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> leaf was <HI>Greek,</HI> then follow'd the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> in <HI>Latin,</HI> then the <HI>&s;econd Greek</HI> leaf, and the <HI>&s;econd Latin,</HI> and &s;o on to the end; but with this precaution, that the <HI>Greek</HI> of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> leaf was only printed upon the <HI>&s;econd</HI> page of it, and the <HI>Latin</HI> ver&s;ion oppo&s;ite to it; the <HI>Latin</HI> upon the <HI>&s;econd</HI> page of the <HI>Latin</HI> leaf was the ver&s;ion of the <HI>Greek</HI> upon the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> page of the <HI>third</HI> leaf, and all the <HI>Greek</HI> upon the <HI>&s;econd</HI> page of this leaf, fell exactly over again&s;t the <HI>Latin</HI> of it in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> page of the <HI>fourth</HI> or <HI>&s;econd Latin</HI> leaf.

<P>BUT, as we remark'd before, this excellent method was never ob|&s;erv'd, not even by tho&s;e, who reprinted &s;uch of <HI>Aldus</HI>'s editions, as had been done after this way; <HI>viz. E&s;op</HI>'s and <HI>Gabriel</HI>'s fables, <HI>La&s;caris</HI>'s gram|mar, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for they printed the <HI>Greek</HI> in one page, and the <HI>Latin</HI> upon the other; which is va&s;tly more inconvenient than his method; the manner of printing both languages in two columns not being invented 'till after the year 1550, <HI>Vide Chevil.</HI> pag. 238. I conceive there is no nece&s;&s;ity of giving a more particular de&s;cription of <HI>Aldus</HI>'s <HI>Greek</HI> types, becau&s;e his works are &s;o univer&s;ally known to the curious; but whoever de&s;ires to know further concerning them, and their &s;uperior excellence to tho&s;e us'd before, may con&s;ult Mr. <HI>Mattaire</HI>'s <HI>Annals,</HI> pag. 237.</P>
<P>ALDUS has been likewi&s;e &s;uppos'd the fir&s;t, or, at lea&s;t, one of the fir&s;t, who printed in <HI>Hebrew.</HI> But this is certainly a mi&s;take; for, tho' he had a font of <HI>Hebrew,</HI> yet he made but little u&s;e of it; and 'tis evi|dent, that the jews of <HI>Soncino</HI> in the duchy of <HI>Milan</HI> began to print books in that language about <HI>twelve</HI> or <HI>fourteen</HI> years before <HI>Aldus</HI> appear'd, as &s;hall be &s;hewn in its proper place. <HI>Chevillier</HI> p. 267 tells us, that he &s;aw nothing of his in this tongue, but the <HI>Hebrew</HI> alphabet, which is &s;till pre&s;erv'd in the <HI>Sorbon</HI> library. We find however, that he wrote and printed an introduction to the <HI>Hebrew</HI> tongue; as appears from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> book printed by him, <HI>ann.</HI> 1501, intitled, <HI>Aldi Manutii Grammaticae Latinae</HI>

<P>BEFORE we clo&s;e the character of this great man, it will be proper to acquaint the reader with the rea&s;on of his a&s;&s;uming the name <HI>Pius</HI> after the year 1503; becau&s;e even this is another te&s;timony of his merit. He receiv'd it from his patron prince <HI>Albertus Pius de Carpi,</HI> who&s;e tutor he had formerly been, and who, on account of his &s;ingular de&s;ert, adopted him into his family, and contributed large &s;ums towards defraying the charges of procuring and correcting manu&s;cripts, preparing three fonts, of <HI>Italick, Greek</HI> and <HI>Hebrew,</HI> characters, entertaining &s;o many learned correctors, and &s;uch a number of workmen, be&s;ide the other charges com|mon to every Printing-hou&s;e. His chief correctors were <HI>Peter Alcyonius, Demetrius Chalcondylas, Marcus Mu&s;urus,</HI> and <HI>Alexander Bondinus.</HI></P>
<P>THE mark of his Printing-hou&s;e, which &s;hall be given, with the re&s;t of the marks or rebus's of the Printers of the 15th century, at the end of this book, was a dolphin twin'd about an anchor, and nibling at it; &s;ignifying his clo&s;e and inde&s;atigable application to bu&s;ine&s;s, which he went through with deliberation and judgment. <HI>Chevillier</HI> tells us, that he took it from the emperor <HI>Titus;</HI> and that <HI>Peter Bembus,</HI> who was afterwards made a cardinal, pre&s;ented him with a &s;ilver medal, which had that em|peror's head on one &s;ide, and on the rever&s;e, a dolphin twi&s;ting him&s;elf round an a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">hor.

<P>SOME vile Printers of <HI>Florence,</HI> finding the impo&s;&s;ibility of equalling <HI>Aldus</HI>'s editions, re&s;olv'd to counterfeit them as well as his rebus, and carry'd on the cheat for &s;ome time, 'till it was di&s;cover'd by means of a mi&s;take committed by the engraver, who revers'd the dolphin, &s;o that his head was on the left &s;ide of the anchor, whereas in <HI>Aldus</HI>'s mark it was on the right.

<P>THE works, which we have of him, from 1494 to 1500, are in num|ber, twenty four; fourteen of which are <HI>Greek,</HI> and the re&s;t <HI>Latin,</HI> or <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek.</HI></P>

Whether the re&s;t are peri&s;h'd, or are &s;till latent in &s;ome libraries, I &s;hall not determine, but am willing to hope the latter, and that time will by degrees bring them to light.</P>
<P>HOWEVER he &s;till continued printing many years after the clo&s;e of the century, and took his father-in-law <HI>Andreas de Azola</HI> [in <HI>Latin Azola|nus</HI>
<PB N="163" REF="174">
in partner&s;hip with him. As to the time of his death, or any parti|culars of it, I have not been able to di&s;cover any thing certain; I &s;hall therefore conclude his hi&s;tory with a remark or two concerning an edi|tion of his, which I hope will not be di&s;agreeable to the reader: it is that of <HI>Poliphili hypnerotomachia,</HI> written by <HI>Franci&s;cus Columna,</HI> to prove that all the world is but a dream; wherein he relates many things worth learning: it has been &s;uppos'd to be printed at <HI>Trevi&s;o, anno</HI> 1467, becau&s;e at the end are the following words; <HI>Tarvi&s;ii cum decori&s;&s;imis Poliae a more lorulis di&s;tineretur mi&s;ellus Poliphilus,</HI> MCCCCLXVII <HI>kalendis Maii, i. e.</HI> when the unfortunate <HI>Poliphilus</HI> was in love with the charming <HI>Polia,</HI> 1467.</P>
<P>THIS they thought to have been the year, when the book was printed; whereas <HI>Mattaire</HI> and <HI>Orlandi</HI> ob&s;erve, that the words plainly demon&s;trate it to be the year, in which <HI>Colonna</HI> fini&s;h'd it. Be&s;ides, it is evident from the character, the regi&s;ters, direction-words, comma's, interrogatory points, and other particularities, as well from the la&s;t leaf, which contains the errata, and concludes thus, <HI>Venetiis men&s;e Decembri</HI> MID <HI>in aedibus Aldi Manutii accurati&s;&s;im&eacute;,</HI> that this edition came out from <HI>Aldus</HI>'s pre&s;s. However, <HI>Orlandi</HI> tells us, that this leaf was de&s;ignedly torn off, becau&s;e there is no date of the year, in which it was printed; but Mr. <HI>Mattaire</HI> gives us an account of the&s;e errata <HI>pag.</HI> 255, which bore this title, <HI>Gli er|rori del libro fatti &s;tampando, liquali corrige co&s;i:</HI> then follows the errata containing fifty nine full lines, a greater number than <HI>Aldus</HI> ever put at the end of his works.

THESE two authors have chiefly confin'd their hi&s;tory to that king|dom; and, as they had all po&s;&s;ible opportunities of &s;earching the records and libraries of that univer&s;ity, have been enabled to acquaint the world with a va&s;t many particularities relating as well to the Art, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the mo&s;t emi|nent Printers there. But &s;ince an induction of them would &s;well this work to too great a bulk, I &s;hall &s;elect the mo&s;t curious and material parts, and refer the reader for the re&s;t to the authors before mention'd. Suffi|cient rea&s;ons, I hope, are already given, again&s;t the opinion of tho&s;e, who, contrary to all the mo&s;t inconte&s;table records, a&s;&s;ert that <HI>Nich. Jen|&s;on</HI> fir&s;t brought printing to <HI>Paris.</HI> This particular is further confirm'd by the two la&s;t mention'd <HI>French</HI> hi&s;torians, who&s;e account of that matter is as follows.</P>
<P>SOME time before the year 1470, <HI>William Fichet</HI> and <HI>John Heynlim de Lapide</HI> or <HI>Lapidanus,</HI> two famous doctors of the univer&s;ity of <HI>Paris,</HI> and of the college of <HI>Sorbon,</HI> ob&s;erving the progre&s;s of printing in &s;everal cities of <HI>Europe,</HI> began to u&s;e their utmo&s;t efforts in order to introduce it not only into that city, but even into their college, where they might give it all nece&s;&s;ary help and encouragement. They were both per&s;ons of great reputation for their learning and publick &s;pirit. The former was a <HI>Savoyard</HI> by birth, and a great re&s;torer of the long neglected art of rhetorick, and all polite literature. The latter was a <HI>German,</HI> and had been rector of the univer&s;ity, and prior of the college of <HI>Sorbon,</HI> to which la&s;t dignity, he was cho&s;en again about this time. As there were then but few, if any, except <HI>Germans,</HI> eminent in printing, <HI>Lapidanus</HI> un|dertook to bring &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;kilfull thither. This could not but &s;eem ea&s;ily attainable by him, who had &s;uch a numerous acquaintance among&s;t the learned in <HI>Germany,</HI> and is &s;uppos'd, upon good grounds, to have been of the &s;ame dioce&s;s, if not the &s;ame city with <HI>Uldric Gering,</HI> a native of <HI>Con&s;tance.</HI> The latter being influenc'd by the kind invitations of a per&s;on of &s;uch e&s;teem, who promis'd him the college of <HI>Sorbon</HI> for his abode, and his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in procuring and preparing manu&s;cripts, and revi&s;ing his editions; and allur'd by the hopes of con&s;iderable gain in &s;o rich a city, wherein the Art was yet unpractis'd, brought two other countrymen with him, <HI>viz. Martin Crantz</HI> and <HI>Michael Friburger</HI> or <HI>de Columbaria</HI> or <HI>Colmar</HI> in <HI>Al&s;ace,</HI> to <HI>Paris;</HI> where he &s;et up pre&s;&s;es in the
<PB N="167" REF="178">
hall of <HI>Sorbon,</HI> and in the year 1470 publi&s;h'd the fir&s;t book, that ever was printed in any city of <HI>France,</HI> except that of <HI>Tours</HI> mention'd in a former chapter. Father <HI>Orlandi</HI> tells us, that <HI>Lewis</HI> XI gave <HI>Fitchet</HI> and <HI>Lapidanus</HI> orders to &s;end for &s;ome of the be&s;t Printers to <HI>Paris,</HI> at his own charge; and that by this means the three <HI>German</HI> partners were in|duc'd to &s;ettle there. <HI>Chevillier</HI> takes no notice of this, but attributes the honour wholly to the <HI>Sorboni&s;ts.</HI> However, it is certain that this king was a great encourager of learning; as appears by the magnificent library which he form'd at his palace in <HI>Paris;</HI> whither he brought not only all the books, which his predece&s;&s;ors, and in particular <HI>Charles</HI> V &s;irnam'd the wi&s;e, and <HI>Charles</HI> VI had collected and &s;et up at <HI>Fountainbleau,</HI> but likewi&s;e all that he could purcha&s;e at any rate, together with a great num|ber of editions printed at <HI>Mentz</HI> by <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> and <HI>Schoeffer;</HI> and what manu|&s;cripts he could not purcha&s;e, he order'd to be curiou&s;ly tran&s;crib'd, and to be &s;et up there. A remarkable in&s;tance of this, mention'd by the <HI>French</HI> writers, is as follows.</P>
<P>THE king under&s;tanding that the college of phy&s;icians at <HI>Paris</HI> had in their library the works of <HI>Rha&s;is</HI> a phy&s;ician, tran&s;lated out of <HI>Arabick</HI> into <HI>Latin,</HI> &s;ent to borrow it, in order to have it tran&s;crib'd; but the college repre&s;enting it as again&s;t their con&s;titutions to lend any of their books without a &s;ufficient pledge; his maje&s;ty was contented to obtain the u&s;e of it, by depo&s;iting a large quantity of his own plate. Whether therefore the king or the two doctors brought the fir&s;t Printers to <HI>Paris,</HI> 'tis beyond doubt, that he gave them &s;ufficient encouragement, and ac|ce&s;s to the library at the <HI>Louvre,</HI> with liberty to print from any of tho&s;e volumes, in the choice of which, it is probable, they were directed by their two patrons.</P>
<P>As the Art was then in its infancy at <HI>Paris,</HI> their fir&s;t editions were in a large round Roman character but greatly inferior in beauty to that of their contemporaries in <HI>Italy;</HI> their paper was &s;mooth and &s;trong, tho' le&s;s white; their impre&s;&s;ions were maim'd and imperfect, with letters and words half printed, and fini&s;h'd with a pencil; the in&s;cription and title of &s;ome epi&s;tles, and the large initial letters of books and chapters were done with the hand, for which a blank was left in the page; they had no capitals, nor regular &s;paces, but were full of abbreviations; in &s;hort,
<PB N="168" REF="179">
there was nothing to recommend them except the newne&s;s, and the beauty of the ink. They us'd few rubricks, and tho&s;e only upon vel|lum; &s;ome of their books begin at the <HI>folio ver&s;o,</HI> or even page; and all of them are without titles, number of pages, &s;ignatures or direction|words; they us'd no &s;ignatures 'till the year 1476, and then plac'd them not at the bottom, but at the top of the pages; they added neither date, nor names of Printer and place; all which are only to be gathered from the prefaces, or epigrams at the end, or &s;ome other circum&s;tances, as will appear from the li&s;t of their works, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e printed in the three fir&s;t years 1470, 1471, and 1472. It is certainly very &s;urpri|&s;ing, that neither <HI>Gering</HI> nor his two learned patrons, who mu&s;t infallibly have &s;een &s;ome of the <HI>Italian</HI> editions, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Ve|nice,</HI> which had all the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary ornaments, &s;hould not make them &s;en|&s;ible of their deficiencies in all tho&s;e re&s;pects. However, &s;o few were the elegant Printers in tho&s;e days, that the learned men of <HI>Paris,</HI> who e&s;teem'd the Art of more con&s;equence than the&s;e embelli&s;hments, fail'd not to acknowledge their obligation to the <HI>Sorbon</HI> doctors, for the &s;ervi|ces they had done to the univer&s;ity in &s;ettling the Printers there, upon whom they were equally liberal of their encomiums. Enough of the&s;e may be &s;een in <HI>Chevillier</HI> pag. 41, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI> I &s;hall only cite in the margin an epigram printed at the end of <HI>Ga&s;par Pergamen&s;is</HI>'s epi&s;tles, which was their fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion, and had prefix'd to it a letter of thanks to tho&s;e great men, upon their bringing the Art to that city.</P>

<P>WE &s;hall &s;hew in the third book of this hi&s;tory, that the univer&s;ity of <HI>Ox&s;ord</HI> had the &s;ame authority over the Printers and book&s;ellers of that city.</P>
<P>TO return to our three Printers, they continued printing but three years at the hou&s;e of the <HI>Sorbon;</HI> after which one of their patrons, <HI>Fichet</HI> being invited to <HI>Rome</HI> by Pope <HI>Sixtus</HI> IV, and the other intending &s;oon after to return to <HI>Germany,</HI> they remov'd to St. <HI>James's-&s;treet,</HI> at the &s;ign
<PB N="170" REF="181">
of the <HI>Golden Sun.</HI> Upon this they immediately rejected all their old punches, matrices and letters, and furni&s;h'd them&s;elves with &s;ome entirely new, and printed &s;everal con&s;iderable volumes 'till the year 1477; at which time <HI>Crantz</HI> and <HI>Friburger</HI> either return'd into <HI>Germany,</HI> or, at lea&s;t, left off printing, for there is no edition with their names after that year; but <HI>Gering</HI> printed in his own name many years longer, as &s;hall be &s;hewn in its place In the mean time, it will be proper to give the reader an account of this new &s;et of characters, which they made u&s;e of in their new hou&s;e.</P>
<P>'TIS to be ob&s;erv'd, that they were of three or four &s;orts, all different from each other, and from tho&s;e us'd at the hou&s;e of the <HI>Sorbon,</HI> and ca&s;t in new matrices. One &s;ort is va&s;tly inferior to their former, and re&s;em|bles the hand-writing of that time, but &s;uch as was done <HI>(&s;tannea manu,</HI> as <HI>Aldus</HI> expre&s;&s;es it) with a heavy hand.</P>
<P>IT is not, however, altogether Gothic, but rather like that which <HI>Schoeffer</HI> us'd at <HI>Mentz.</HI> Another &s;ort was not unlike this in &s;hape, but of a much larger face. The <HI>third</HI> was a Roman much more round and fine than the two former; but the <HI>fourth</HI> &s;ort, not us'd by <HI>Gering</HI> 'till after the year 1478, that is, after his partners had left him, is a very beautiful, large Roman, which (if we may believe <HI>Chevillier,</HI> who &s;aw and compar'd them) is in no ca&s;e inferior to that of the <HI>Spira</HI>'s, <HI>Jen|&s;on,</HI> or any other of the famous <HI>Venetian</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Printers, either before or &s;ince. Thus <HI>Gering</HI> attain'd to a degree of perfection equal with any of his brethren; but was at la&s;t oblig'd to comply with the cu&s;tom, and print &s;everal books in Gothic, &s;uch as <HI>Virgil</HI> and &s;ome others, be&s;ides tho&s;e for the u&s;e of churches. The editions printed at this hou&s;e, and in the&s;e new characters, are &s;till defective with re&s;pect to their dates or Printers names, &s;ome wanting the one, &s;ome the other, and &s;ome both, as appears by the li&s;t of his works given us by the foremention'd author, <HI>anno</HI> 1480. <HI>Gering</HI> took into partner&s;hip with him for &s;ome time, <HI>William Maynyal;</HI> and in the year 1483 remov'd from St. <HI>James's-&s;treet,</HI> and took a lea&s;e, during life, of a hou&s;e belonging to the college of <HI>Sor|bon,</HI> where he &s;et up his old &s;ign of the <HI>Golden-&s;un.</HI> As he was now be|come very rich, and had contracted an intimate friend&s;hip with the <HI>Sor|bon</HI> collegians, he made them &s;ome con&s;iderable donatives both in books
<PB N="171" REF="182">
and money; upon which account they cho&s;e him fellow of that college, and a&s;&s;ign'd him chambers and commons in it: and as he was not en|gag'd in matrimony, he took the more plea&s;ure in conver&s;ing with them, communicating his de&s;igns, and u&s;ing their advice about the books which he was to print, and their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in correcting them; in return for which he pre&s;ented them with copies of all his editions. It was no &s;mall advantage to that college (which was call'd at fir&s;t by the founder <HI>Robert Sorbon, Societas pauperum magi&s;trorum Pari&s;iis in theologica facultate &s;tudentium)</HI> to have &s;o generous a friend and benefactor admitted into it; who requited them for this honour with va&s;t legacies, left by him in his will to this college, and that of <HI>Montague</HI> in the &s;ame city. For by his &s;ucce&s;s in printing 'till <HI>anno</HI> 1510, in which he died, he had ama&s;s'd a prodigious quantity of wealth, all which he bequeath'd to tho&s;e two colleges. What he endow'd the <HI>Sorbon</HI> in particular with, was &s;uffici|ent to maintain <HI>eight</HI> fellows, to be added to tho&s;e on the old foundation, and two lectures every day, one in the morning for the Old, and ano|ther in the afternoon for the New Te&s;tament; be&s;ides &s;everal other do|natives to tho&s;e of the hou&s;e whom he had a particular e&s;teem for.</P>
<P>Now con&s;idering, that he was the fir&s;t Printer of that city and king|dom; that he was invited thither by the college of <HI>Sorbon;</HI> that he had been &s;o great a ma&s;ter of his art, and &s;o liberal to that poor &s;ociety in his life-time, and after his death; the reader may perhaps expect to hear of &s;ome monument erected by them to his memory: but 'tis plain from what <HI>Chevillier,</HI> a fellow of that college, tells us, that they did not &s;o much as &s;et a grave-&s;tone over him, to let the world know where that great man was bury'd; &s;o that our la&s;t mention'd author, after a va&s;t deal of pains, could not gain the lea&s;t certainty about it. However, to do them ju&s;tice, they order'd an anniver&s;ary-ma&s;s to be &s;aid on the 23d of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> on which he dy'd. Who his correctors were, is difficult to determine; but it is probable he made u&s;e of any of the collegians, whom he pleas'd. He had &s;ome other partners be&s;ides <HI>Maynyal</HI> beforementi|on'd, and in&s;tructed &s;everal Printers, who &s;ignaliz'd them&s;elves both du|ring his life and after he dy'd. There were likewi&s;e divers other Print|ing-hou&s;es &s;et up at <HI>Paris</HI> &s;oon after his, of which we &s;hall &s;peak, when we have given &s;ome further account of his works; <HI>Chevillier</HI> in his li&s;t of
<PB N="172" REF="183">
them divides them into three cla&s;&s;es, <HI>viz.</HI> tho&s;e which he printed with his two partners in the college from 1470 to 1473; next tho&s;e printed at the <HI>Golden Sun</HI> in St. <HI>James's-&s;treet</HI> 'till <HI>anno</HI> 1483; and <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> tho&s;e which he printed from that time 'till his death, either by him&s;elf or with his other partners.

<P>THESE two Printers were likewi&s;e natives of <HI>Germany,</HI> but had already &s;tudied &s;ometime in the univer&s;ity of <HI>Paris,</HI> where the former had attain'd to the degree of ma&s;ter of arts: the&s;e two became acquainted with their countryman <HI>Gering,</HI> and inform'd him of their de&s;ign of &s;etting up a Printing-hou&s;e, begging his a&s;&s;i&s;tance and in&s;tructions therein, which he readily granted: and thus was the &s;econd Pre&s;s &s;et up at <HI>Paris</HI> by the&s;e two learned per&s;ons, who became &s;oon after, no le&s;s famous, for their indu&s;try and application, than they had been for their learning.

<P>HE was one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Printers and book&s;ellers of his time, and very eminent for the curio&s;ity and number of his ditions.

<HEAD>45. JO. PETIT, <HI>Pari&s;ian,</HI> 1498.</HEAD>
<P>JOHN PETIT was a native of <HI>Paris,</HI> and rather a book&s;eller than a Printer: he is ju&s;tly e&s;teem'd one of the mo&s;t eminent and indu&s;trious ones of his time. He kept the greate&s;t number of the be&s;t workmen of any of his contemporaries, with no le&s;s than fifteen pre&s;&s;es continually at work at his own charges, whil&s;t him&s;elf was engag'd in the bu&s;ine&s;s of his &s;hop, at the <HI>&s;ilver Lyon,</HI> and procuring the mo&s;t &s;kilfull correctors to revi&s;e his works. He gain'd a prodigious reputation by the beauty and correctne&s;s of his impre&s;&s;ions, which, tho' printed in a Gothic character, are much e&s;teem'd by the curious. He began to print <HI>anno</HI> 1498, tho' &s;ome copies
<PB N="176" REF="187">
of editions by &s;everal former Printers have likewi&s;e his name, as Mr. <HI>Mat|taire</HI> informs us, yet all have not; he continued printing 'till <HI>anno</HI> 1532, and many of his impre&s;&s;ions are as &s;carce as they are curious. The learned <HI>Henry Stephens,</HI> father of &s;o many great Printers of that name, was &s;o well &s;atisfy'd of his merit, that he was glad to have him for his partner with <HI>Wolfgang Hopyl</HI> mention'd above, who was a Printer of much older date: <HI>Petit</HI> became &s;o famous, both for the beauty and correctne&s;s, as well as the number of his editions, that he was afterwards &s;worn Printer and book&s;eller to the univer&s;ity of <HI>Paris,</HI> and cho&s;en &s;yndic or ma&s;ter of that company; among tho&s;e Printers which he employ'd, was the famous <HI>Jodocus Badius,</HI> who printed &s;everal con&s;iderable editions for him. In the title page of his books, he us'd the words <HI>Petit a Petit [by little and little]</HI> alluding to his own name, which he al&s;o us'd for his motto. The books which we finde printed in his name from 1498 to 1500, are only three, the fir&s;t of which is much valued by &s;tudents in law, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>BEFORE I di&s;mi&s;s this chapter, I cannot omit ob&s;erving, that <HI>Paris</HI> hath been a noble patrone&s;s of the Art of Printing. 'Tis true, <HI>Venice</HI> is ju&s;tly fam'd upon this account; yet it ought to be remember'd, that mo&s;t of her celebrated Printers were of the <HI>French</HI> nation, and &s;ignaliz'd them&s;elves as much in this Art, as any other nation; and that <HI>Paris</HI> ex|cell'd all other cities of that kingdom in this re&s;pect. The encourage|ments which their kings, and the learned of that and other countries, have given the Art, and the care of the univer&s;ity over the Printers, have
<PB N="177" REF="188">
contributed extremely to the great improvements made therein. Be&s;ides this, the <HI>French</HI> have &s;hewn an extraordinary genius and &s;kill in the cut|ting of their punches for all languages; they have been very curious about their paper, and more particularly in adorning their editions with cutts, head and tail pieces, initial letters, rubricks and other embelli&s;h|ments of that nature. This I mention not &s;o much with re&s;pect to the 15th century, as to the following. No city has produc'd a greater num|ber of the fine&s;t bibles than <HI>Paris.</HI> Their large, royal and polyglot bibles are ju&s;tly e&s;teem'd ma&s;ter-pieces of that kind; their editions of general and provincial councils, of canon and civil-law, the works of the fathers, chronological and hi&s;torical books, and, in &s;hort, in every art and &s;cience, are very numerous, rich, and valuable; and many of them contain &s;even, eight, and ten large volumes, and &s;ome twenty, thirty, and even thirty &s;even, as the acts of the council printed by the famous <HI>Anthony Vitr&eacute;</HI> at the <HI>Louvre.</HI> The women likewi&s;e were very eminent in this province; and particularly, <HI>Charlotte Guillard,</HI> the widow of <HI>Berthold Rembolt, Ulric Gering</HI>'s partner, who for the &s;pace of 50 years kept &s;everal pre&s;&s;es, and printed a great number of large and correct editions both in <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek,</HI> her be&s;t editions were publi&s;h'd after &s;he became a widow the &s;e|cond time, <HI>viz.</HI> the bible, the fathers; in particular, the works of St. <HI>Gregory</HI> in two volumes were printed &s;o accurately, that the <HI>errata</HI> con|tain'd but three faults. Her fame at la&s;t increas'd &s;o, that the learned <HI>Lewis Lippoman,</HI> bi&s;hop of <HI>Verona,</HI> made choice of her to print his <HI>Cate|na SS. patrum in Gene&s;im,</HI> which he fini&s;h'd in <HI>Portugal.</HI> This edition &s;he perform'd &s;o much to his &s;atisfaction, that when he a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the council of <HI>Trent,</HI> he came on purpo&s;e to <HI>Paris</HI> to return her thanks, and prevail'd upon her to print likewi&s;e his &s;econd volume, <HI>viz. Catena in Exodum,</HI> which &s;he perform'd with equal beauty and correctne&s;s. The&s;e with ma|ny other particulars relating to that admirable woman, may be &s;een in <HI>Chevil.</HI> p. 48, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI></P>
<P>As <HI>Paris</HI> has always abounded in excellent Printers, and furni&s;h'd mo&s;t other cities of <HI>Europe</HI> with &s;ome of them; &s;o, on the other hand, it mu&s;t be own'd, that it has produc'd &s;everal equally bad, who have publi&s;h'd many wretched editions; and 'tis probable they might have &s;till increas'd, had not the univer&s;ity check'd their growth. For as it has &s;uch power
<PB N="178" REF="189">
over all Printers and book&s;ellers, as to refu&s;e admitting tho&s;e into the bu&s;ine&s;s, who are not &s;ufficiently qualify'd, and to turn them out of it, or &s;u&s;pend or fine them for any mi&s;demeanors, as was hinted before; it can more ea&s;ily re&s;train them, than where &s;uch checks are wanting. However tho&s;e, who&s;e merit recommends them, enjoy all the encourage|ment they can rea&s;onably de&s;ire, both from their princes and the univer|&s;ity. They are endow'd with privileges, exemptions, and immunities beyond any other city; and have had frequent opportunities of rai&s;ing them&s;elves to great dignities, of acquiring large e&s;tates, and in &s;hort, every thing &s;uitable to their merit.</P>

<P>MILAN [in <HI>latin Mediolanum]</HI> is one of the four chief cities of <HI>Italy,</HI> &s;ituate near the rivers <HI>Adda</HI> and <HI>Te&s;ino,</HI> and &s;aid to have been built by the <HI>Trojans</HI> after their expul&s;ion by <HI>Bellover</HI> king of the <HI>Gauls.</HI> This city, after a variety of chances and wars, was almo&s;t ruined by <HI>Frederic Bar|baro&s;&s;a;</HI> but now flouri&s;hes under the emperor of <HI>Germany.</HI> It received the Art of Printing very early, and had many excellent artificers from the beginning, who&s;e works are equally valuable with tho&s;e of any other cities We cannot po&s;itively affirm any thing concerning the time, in which this Art was brought hither, nor who were the men that &s;et it up. The fir&s;t both in time as well as excellency was.</P>
<P N="1">1. ANTHONY ZAROT, 1470.</P>
<P>HE was a native of the city of <HI>Parma,</HI> tho' of <HI>Creten&s;ian</HI> parents, as appears by &s;ome of his colophons, and gain'd a great reputation for 30 years, in which he continued printing, by his elegant and correct im|pre&s;&s;ions in a beautiful Roman character, which are &s;ufficiently known among the learned. He was oblig'd indeed to comply with the cu&s;tom in printing &s;ome editions in old Gothic; yet even th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e have all the ele|gancy and beauty they can admit of. He is e&s;teem'd the inventor of &s;ignatures, or alphabetical letters at the bottom of every &s;heet, which
<PB N="181" REF="192">
at fir&s;t he plac'd under the la&s;t line of the page, where they ought to be: But afterwards he put them, upon what account is hard to gue&s;s, at the end of the la&s;t line, &s;o as to make them &s;erve, as it were, for the la&s;t word in the page. This appears by his edition of <HI>John Simoneta de ge&s;tis Franci&s;ci Sfortiae ducis Mediol.</HI> anno 1486. This whim of his was not fol|low'd by any Printer, nor by him&s;elf long; for he &s;oon return'd to the fir&s;t method. His main province was printing of cla&s;&s;icks, which he ex|ecuted with extraordinary diligence and accuracy. He is &s;aid to be the fir&s;t that printed mi&s;&s;als or ma&s;s-books for the u&s;e of the clergy, who were hitherto us'd to MS ones. That which he printed <HI>anno</HI> 1478, had the four <HI>Latin</HI> ver&s;es in red letters, which you will find in the margin <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><L>Antoni patria Parmen&s;is gente Zarote,</L>

His chief corrector was the famous <HI>Peter Ju&s;tin Philelphus,</HI> a per&s;on of learning and great application, e&s;pecially in correcting the faulty edi|tions which <HI>Zarot</HI> was oblig'd to procure from <HI>Rome</HI> or other places. His next corrector was the learned <HI>P.

<P>WE have twenty &s;ix of his impre&s;&s;ions &s;till extant, many of which have either an epigram or a colophon in his commendation.

<P>STRASBURGH, in <HI>Latin Argentina</HI> and <HI>Argentoratum,</HI> is an epi&s;copal See, and the metropolis of <HI>Al&s;atia</HI> upon the borders of <HI>France,</HI> celebra|ted for the number of learned men, which it has produc'd; and the beauty and magnificence of its churches, towers, buildings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> according to the poet's de&s;cription

<P>IT was the native place of <HI>John Guttenbergh,</HI> to which, after his di&s;a|greement with <HI>Fau&s;t,</HI> he brought the Art of Printing together with &s;ome of his artificers; &s;o that it may be ju&s;tly e&s;teem'd, at lea&s;t, one of the
<PB N="184" REF="195">
fir&s;t cities, that practis'd it after <HI>Mentz,</HI> tho' all the monuments of it are &s;o far lo&s;t to us, that we know not any books with a certain date, printed there before the year 1471.</P>
<P>WE have &s;een, in the fir&s;t part of this hi&s;tory, how much this city hath been celebrated by &s;ome authors, upon the account of <HI>John Guttenbergh,</HI> whom they &s;uppos'd to have been the inventor of this Art, or at lea&s;t to have laid the fir&s;t foundation of it here, tho' he was oblig'd to retire to <HI>Mentz</HI> in order to perfect it. But as this, I conceive, has been &s;uffici|ently confuted already, it is unnece&s;&s;ary to repeat it here. I have like|wi&s;e given the reader an account of another controverfy in favour of <HI>Strasburgh</HI> and <HI>John Mentel</HI> &s;tarted about two hundred years after the di&s;|covery of this Art, by Dr. <HI>Mentel</HI> of the univer&s;ity of <HI>Paris,</HI> who a&s;&s;erted that his ance&s;tor was the Inventor of Printing; which di&s;covery he was robb'd of by a treacherous &s;ervant, whom he &s;u&s;pects to be our famous <HI>John Fau&s;t.</HI> I hope, I have fully expo&s;ed the vanity of this author's pre|tences, and his unfaithfulne&s;s in quoting te&s;timonies in behalf of <HI>Mentel;</HI> again&s;t whom, were there no other evidence, it would be &s;ufficient to al|lege, that there is not one book printed in his name before the year 147<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, and that without any mention of the city of <HI>Strasburgh.</HI></P>
<P>ALL that is proper to add at pre&s;ent is, that our author, to elude, if po&s;&s;ible, the force of this objection, affirm'd that this book, which <HI>John Mentel</HI> fini&s;h'd <HI>anno</HI> 1473, was no le&s;s than twenty years a printing, and contain'd ten large volumes in <HI>fol.</HI> &s;o that it mu&s;t have been begun about 1453, <HI>i. e.</HI> four years before <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> had printed any work in his name, but this is a groundle&s;s conjecture.</P>
<P>THIS book is the <HI>Speculum Morale</HI> of <HI>Vincentius Belvacen&s;is,</HI> a very voluminous work; but that it &s;hould have taken up 20 years in printing, is only &s;aid without any authority or te&s;timony for it; however we may allow it to have taken up &s;ome con&s;iderable time, without le&s;&s;ening the validity of what has been heretofore affirm'd after &s;everal eminent au|thors, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>John Fau&s;t,</HI> at his return from <HI>Paris,</HI> where he had been &s;elling his printed bibles for manu&s;cripts, &s;tay'd &s;ome time at <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> where he taught <HI>Mentel</HI> his Art. The only difficulty again&s;t it is, that if thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> la&s;t had been let into the &s;ecret &s;o &s;oon, there would be &s;ome ear|lier and a greater number of his productions to be &s;een. The former is
<PB N="185" REF="196">
ea&s;ily an&s;wer'd by the &s;ad experience we have, of too many of the old monuments of the Art being either lo&s;t, or not yet di&s;cover'd; and the latter, <HI>De la Caille</HI> endeavours to account for, who peremptorily a&s;&s;erts this <HI>Mentel</HI> to be the &s;ame with <HI>John Mentelen</HI> or <HI>Manthen de Geretz&s;heim,</HI> who went and &s;ettled at <HI>Venice,</HI> and a&s;&s;ociated him&s;elf with the famous <HI>John de Cologne,</HI> one of the mo&s;t eminent and fir&s;t Printers of that city about the year 1474, with whom he printed &s;everal valuable editions, mention'd in the chapter of <HI>Venice.</HI></P>
<P>IF this a&s;&s;ertion be well grounded, 'tis &s;uperfluous to &s;eek for any of his works at <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> except the <HI>Speculum</HI> beforemention'd, if even that was printed there. But as <HI>la Caille</HI> has not mention'd his authority, I &s;hall not dare to a&s;&s;ert the truth of this too po&s;itively. We mu&s;t not omit taking notice, that this <HI>John Manthen</HI> continued printing at <HI>Venice,</HI> with his partner afore&s;aid, 'till the year 1480, as the reader may &s;ee by what has been &s;aid of him there; whereas <HI>John Mentel</HI> is affirm'd by the Dr. from the authority of <HI>Ga&s;par Benegerus</HI> to have dy'd at <HI>Strasburgh</HI> two years before, <HI>viz.</HI> 1478, in honour of whom the great bell of that city was or|der'd to be rung the &s;unday following <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Obiit dominus <HI>Johannes Mentel</HI> &s;abatho po&s;t conceptionem virginis <HI>Moriae, an o</HI> MCCCC LXX IIX; et factus e&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">i pul&s;us cum campana magna Dominica &s;equenti.

I &s;hall not take upon me to decide the controver&s;y, but only &s;ay, that if the <HI>Speculum</HI> afore&s;aid, be <HI>Mentel</HI>'s fir&s;t edition at <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> it will follow, that he was out&s;tript, at lea&s;t by two years there, by the famous <HI>Henry Eggel&s;tein,</HI> of whom we have only two volumes, both printed <HI>anno</HI> 1471; the la&s;t of which is per|haps one of the large&s;t that ever was printed, the paper of it being of an extraordinary &s;ize, exceeding even that which is commonly call'd <HI>Charta magna.</HI> It hath likewi&s;e another remarkable particular, which is, that the beginning and end of it are printed in red, and is therefore the fir&s;t edition done after that manner.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Article.</HI> I. <HI>The City of</HI> NAPLES.</HEAD>
<P>NAPLES, in <HI>Latin Neapolis</HI> and <HI>Parthenope,</HI> is the metropolis of the kingdom of that name, in <HI>Italy.</HI> It was formerly govern'd by kings of its own, but afterwards became &s;ubject to the crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> and is
<PB N="192" REF="203">
now under the emperor of <HI>Germany.</HI> This city has been the re&s;idence of men of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h'd wit and learning, in ancient and mo|dern ages; as <HI>Virgil,</HI> who is &s;aid to have writ his Georgicks here; <HI>Livy, Horace, Claudian, Petrarck, Bocatellus Panormitanus, Laurentius Valla,</HI> the great re&s;torer of latinity and eloquence; <HI>Perillus,</HI> an elegant <HI>Italian</HI> poet; and many others of con&s;picuous merit. The great number of learned men in this city, particularly, when printing became known and &s;pread it&s;elf over <HI>Europe,</HI> was a &s;ufficient inducement for &s;ome of the be&s;t Printers to &s;ettle there. But none encourag'd the Art and arti&s;ts more, than <HI>Ferdinand</HI> III. king of <HI>Naples,</HI> whom we had occa&s;ion to mention before, upon the account of the free acce&s;s, which the learn|ed had to his per&s;on, and their epi&s;tolary corre&s;pondence with him, and who liv'd at the time of the infancy of the Art. As his learning was equal to the e&s;teem he had for the learned, I doubt not but it was he who procur'd the famous <HI>Sixtus Ru&s;&s;inger</HI> a learned and pious prie&s;t, who was a native of <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> to &s;ettle in his capital. This &s;eems more than probable, not only becau&s;e he was the fir&s;t who &s;et up a pre&s;s at <HI>Naples,</HI> but from the great marks of e&s;teem which that prince &s;hew'd him; in&s;omuch, that having di&s;cover'd his intention to return to his own country, he try'd all po&s;&s;ible means to divert him from it, and even offer'd him a noble bi&s;hoprick, or any other preferment, if that could have fix'd him in his dominions. But this venerable old man, whether out of mode&s;ty, or rather a de&s;ire of &s;pending the &s;mall remainder of his days in his native city, refus'd the king's offer, and return'd home loaden with the pre&s;ents of that generous monarch. <HI>Rie&s;&s;inger</HI> was not only a Printer, but a clergyman, and famous for his great learning; yet as he continued but a &s;hort time at <HI>Naples,</HI> we have few editions of his. <HI>Orlandi</HI> gives him a contemporary and fellow citizen, <HI>viz. Peter</HI> of <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> who &s;ettled there about the &s;ame year; but as I do not find that he printed any thing in company with <HI>Rie&s;&s;inger,</HI> or that any of his impre&s;&s;ions are left, I &s;hall &s;ay no more of him.</P>
<P>WE have but four impre&s;&s;ions of <HI>Sixtus Ru&s;&s;inger,</HI> or <HI>Rie&s;&s;inger,</HI> two dated <HI>anno</HI> 1471 and 1472, the other two without date. They are all curious and correct, and two of them have <HI>Latin</HI> epigrams at the end

<P>NUREMBERGH or <HI>Norimbergh,</HI> in <HI>Latin Norimberga,</HI> is a free city in <HI>Germany</HI> upon the confines of <HI>Swabia, Franconia,</HI> and <HI>Bavaria,</HI> &s;ituate upon the river <HI>Pegnitz.</HI> It was formerly a democratical commonwealth, but upon &s;ome dome&s;tick &s;edition, it reduc'd it&s;elf to an ari&s;tocracy, in the reign of the emperor <HI>Charles</HI> IV, under the government of twenty four &s;enators cho&s;en out of &s;o many of their anciente&s;t families; which form of government hath been continued ever &s;ince. The city is very rich, large and populous, &s;urrounded with a double wall above eight miles in circuit, and 180 lofty towers. It was always celebrated for producing the be&s;t artificers in every kind of handicraft, and particular|ly for a beautiful metal of their own making, call'd <HI>Nurembergh</HI> copper; the compo&s;ition of which was kept with all imaginable &s;ecrecy within their walls, every workman being fir&s;t &s;worn to it; &s;o that the metal was almo&s;t equally dear with &s;ilver; till about the latter end of the la&s;t century, one of their own citizens came over and &s;old the &s;ecret here in <HI>England,</HI> which has made it more common, and con&s;equently le&s;&s;en'd the price of it. This metal I purpo&s;ely chu&s;e to mention becau&s;e it was reckon'd very excellent for making of matrices, being far more ductile than the common copper, and not &s;o apt to break the punches.</P>
<P>IT will be no ea&s;y matter to fix the time when the Art of Printing was brought to this city. <HI>John Andreas Endlers</HI> a Printer of <HI>Nuremberg,</HI> who publi&s;h'd a piece on Printing, in <HI>High Dutch, anno</HI> 1722, and in it has given us an account of its progre&s;s in that city, acquaints us that he had met with &s;ome MS. annals, which affirm, that the Art was no &s;ooner found out at <HI>Mentz,</HI> but it was immediately communicated to <HI>Nuremberg,</HI> which did therefore receive it about the year 1444 accord|ing to one, or 1440 according to another. 'Tis true, our author is &s;o far from being &s;atisfy'd with their account, that he has even taken the pains to confute them from more authentic te&s;timonies; however, tho'
<PB N="200" REF="211">
I do not de&s;ign to enter into a detail of that di&s;pute, yet I could not forbear mentioning thus much, becau&s;e it &s;erves to confirm a former ob&s;ervation, <HI>viz.</HI> that not only the Printers, but likewi&s;e the <HI>Cities</HI> them|&s;elves have taken no &s;mall pains to antedate their re&s;pective claims to this Art.</P>
<P>I have already taken notice in the fir&s;t part of this hi&s;tory, <HI>pag.</HI> 22. that the di&s;covery of the Art of Printing had been attributed by <HI>Pur|bach,</HI> and <HI>Peter Ramus</HI> to that learned mathematician and a&s;tronomer <HI>John de Monte regio,</HI> or <HI>Regio-Montanus,</HI> and mention'd <HI>Manilius</HI>'s a&s;trono|my printed by him without date or places name. Our <HI>German</HI> author acquaints us upon the authority of <HI>Ga&s;&s;endi,</HI> one of the <HI>French</HI> royal ma|thematicians, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that <HI>Regiomontanus</HI> came to <HI>Nuremberg</HI> about <HI>anno</HI> 1471, with a de&s;ign to &s;et up a Printing-hou&s;e there, in order to print his own works and tho&s;e of other learned men, with greater accuracy and &s;peed, and to improve the Art of Printing in &s;everal of its branch|es; but that he met with &s;o many ob&s;tacles to his de&s;ign, that he &s;aw him&s;elf forc'd to make u&s;e of foreign Printing-hou&s;es, &s;uch as they were, till one <HI>Bernard Walter</HI> offer'd to bear the charges of erect|ing a Printing-hou&s;e for him (as he likewi&s;e did towards many other curious inventions of his) and enabled him to print <HI>Purbac</HI>'s new theory, <HI>Manilius</HI>'s a&s;tronomy, and his own <HI>Ephemerides</HI> for the u&s;e of the publick."</Q></P>
<P>OUR author ob&s;erves further, that as this account of <HI>Ga&s;&s;endi</HI>'s doth quite overturn <HI>Peter Ramus</HI>'s &s;uppo&s;ition of <HI>Regiomontanus</HI> being the inventor of the art, &s;o it likewi&s;e &s;hews him to have contributed much towards the improvement of it. It likewi&s;e proves that there were &s;ome Pre&s;&s;es in this city before he came thither, but who they were that &s;et them up, and what works they printed before that time, is what he has not been able to find out, becau&s;e they have no dates or Printer's names.</P>
<P>THE olde&s;t book he could find with a date, is the <HI>Comme&s;torium Vi|tiorum</HI> of <HI>Francis de Retza</HI> a <HI>Dominican Fryar;</HI> at the end of which are the words which you'll find in the margin <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hic Codex egregius Come&s;torii vitiorum &s;acre Theologie Profe&s;&s;oris eximii <HI>Franci&s;ci</HI> de <HI>Retza</HI> Ordinis predicatorum finit feliciter. <HI>Nu|remberge anno</HI> <GAP DESC="symbol" EXTENT="1 letter"> LXX<HI REND="small">o.</HI> Patronarum forma|rumque Concordia &amp; proportione impre&s;&s;us.</NOTE> with this odd date <GAP DESC="symbol" EXTENT="1 letter"> LXX<HI REND="small">o.</HI>

<P>A per&s;on eminent for learning, and the number, elegancy and cor|rectne&s;s of his editions, which gain'd him the title of the prince of Printers among the learned of his time. At fir&s;t indeed his character, tho' of the <HI>Venetian</HI> &s;ort, was &s;omewhat imperfect, and inferior to that of many of his cotemporaries; but he afterwards procur'd a new &s;ett, which hath been ju&s;tly e&s;teem'd ever &s;ince as fine as any that have been us'd ei|ther before or after him. He was no le&s;s &s;olicitous in correcting his works; &s;o that tho' he was alone &s;ufficient for that task, yet he took the learned <HI>Frederic Pi&s;torius</HI> for his a&s;&s;i&s;tant. He &s;par'd no co&s;t nor pains in procuring the be&s;t manu&s;cripts, and always de&s;ir'd the judgment of the learned before he ventur'd to print them. The great <HI>Jodocus Badius</HI> hath made this &s;hort but ju&s;t panegyric upon him, in a letter written to him <HI>anno</HI> 1499, and printed at the beginning of the works of <HI>Angelus Politianus anno</HI> 1519 <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Litteratos omnes &amp; colis &amp; foves, pervi|gilemque curam ad bonos codices vere ter&s;e &amp; &s;ine mendis imprimendos adhibes.</NOTE>; That he was a great friend and lover of the learned, and indefatigable in printing the be&s;t copies faithfully, neatly and correctly. Mr. <HI>Mattaire</HI> hath given us an extract of this letter in his <HI>Annales Typogr.</HI> p. 79. by which the reader may &s;ee what e&s;teem this great man was in, not only among the learned, but likewi&s;e among the be&s;t Printers of his time; and it may be &s;aid of him, that he printed more works than any of them, particularly bibles, of which the reader
<PB N="202" REF="213">
will find no le&s;s than 12 editions &s;till extant, one of which is in 5, ano|ther in 6 volumes in folio, and a third with fine wooden cuts.</P>
<P>HE was no le&s;s diligent in printing other works, and we are told by <HI>John And. Endters,</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he kept daily twenty four pre&s;&s;es at work, and employ'd no le&s;s than an hundred journeymen whom he main|tain'd without doors; they had a &s;et hour to come to work, and to leave off, and he admitted none &s;ingle into his hou&s;e but oblig'd them to wait at his door till they were altogether, and then they were ad|mitted in, and enter'd upon their re&s;pective works.
<P>HE was likewi&s;e a con&s;iderable Book&s;eller, and kept a &s;pacious printing-hou&s;e at <HI>Lyons</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> where he had &s;undry law-books printed for him; be&s;ides this, he had his factors and agents in the mo&s;t con&s;iderable cities in <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> and kept &s;ixteen open &s;hops be&s;ide ware-hou&s;es, and in all of them a con&s;iderable &s;tock of the be&s;t books then extant, &s;o that he never was at a lo&s;s for any good edi|tions to &s;upply his cu&s;tomers with."</P></Q></P>
<P>THUS he continued printing both at <HI>Nuremberg</HI> and at <HI>Lyons</HI> with great &s;ucce&s;s and applau&s;e, till the year 1501 if not beyond; however we don't find any edition of his of a more recent date, which makes me be|lieve that he left off printing about that time. In 1513. <HI>James Sachon</HI> one of his workmen at <HI>Lyons,</HI> printed <HI>Ca&s;tellanus</HI>'s <HI>Latin</HI> bible for him with this colophon, <HI>Lugduni per Jacobum Sachon expen&s;is Antonii Kobur|ger.</HI> The &s;ame is likewi&s;e dated from <HI>Nurembergh,</HI> but is &s;uppos'd to be the &s;ame edition with that of <HI>Lyons;</HI> he dy'd in this year after ha|ving been for &s;ome time a member of the chief council of <HI>Nuremberg;</HI> all the editions that we have of him, his bibles inclu&s;ive, from 1472 to 1500, amounts to but thirty &s;even, a number too incon&s;iderable for the many pre&s;&s;es and workmen that he kept, which gives me room to hope that time will di&s;cover a great many more.</P>

His improvement in the art of engraving or cutting upon wood, was carried by him to its utmo&s;t perfection, as all per&s;ons mu&s;t own who have &s;een any of his works.</P>
<P>The part of &s;hadowing which is call'd cro&s;s-hatching, and which has been lo&s;t for many years, and conducted (if not wholly invented) by him with &s;uch extraordinary beauty and truth, join'd to the uncommon lu|&s;tre of his ink, has &s;urpa&s;s'd all the wood-cutters ever &s;ince. His rea|&s;on for preferring this method of cutting on wood to that of copper plates; were; 1. The rouling-pre&s;s, which is wholly us'd in the later, was not then &s;o perfect as &s;ince; 2. His mo&s;t con&s;iderable works (of which he was the author, for he &s;carce printed any other) being chiefly geometry, per&s;pective, fortification and architecture as well as hi&s;tory, wooden cutts were much the more eligible method upon &s;everal accounts, e&s;pecially when cut by &s;uch a ma&s;terly hand as his. The only difficulty was to make it &s;ub&s;ervient to his hi&s;tory-pieces; but that he ea&s;ily &s;urmounted by the &s;trength of his genius; and tho&s;e who have &s;een any of his performances even in this kind, will readily own that nothing of that nature ever equall'd them. His u&s;ual mark was the initial letters of his name AD joyn'd together thus <FIGURE REND="inline">
<FIGDESC>Albert Durer's printer's mark</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> but his mo&s;t effectual way to prevent counterfeits was by giving his works a degree of beauty never yet attain'd to.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to his Printing, I have already hinted, that he &s;eldom meddled with any works but his own, as I can find; but as I have met with none done before the year 1500, tho' he probably entred into that province before that time; I &s;hall not trouble the reader with a li&s;t of them, but content my &s;elf with &s;ubjoining an account of a few of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, which I have &s;een: They are e&s;teem'd by the learn|ed ma&s;ter-pieces of the kind, and pre&s;erv'd as monuments of the author's merit, being as follow;</P>

1. THE hi&s;tory of the <HI>Apocalyp&s;e,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of a fine &s;et of draughts upon that &s;ubject, all cut upon wood with his own hand, and with the utmo&s;t beauty and truth.</P>

I hope therefore the reader will excu&s;e this digre&s;&s;ion in favour of a per&s;on to whom the world owes the great improvements made in the art of cutting upon wood, which has been &s;o &s;erviceable to the Printers in the ornamental part of their works.</P>

<HEAD>4. JOHN AMERBACH, 1481.</HEAD>
<P>JOHN AMERBACH, one of the mo&s;t excellent and learned Printers of his time, was at fir&s;t a &s;tudent at <HI>Paris,</HI> under the famous <HI>Jo. Lapidanus</HI> or <HI>a Lapide,</HI> who, being rector of that univer&s;ity, invited the three <HI>Ger|mans</HI> thither. <HI>Amerbach</HI> follow'd his &s;tudies 'till he attain'd to the de|gree of ma&s;ter of arts, &s;oon after which he came to <HI>Ba&s;il,</HI> and &s;et up the Art of Printing, for which he became as famous, as he had been before for his learning.</P>
<P>WHAT countryman he was is not ea&s;y to determine. Some <HI>French</HI> annali&s;ts challenge him for theirs, and <HI>Orlandi</HI> calls him a <HI>Pari&s;ian,</HI> tho' perhaps on no other account, than that he &s;tudied &s;o long in that univer|&s;ity. His name is unque&s;tionably <HI>German;</HI> but neither the colophons of his editions, nor his epitaph, make any mention of his country; for which rea&s;on, we &s;hall not pretend to affirm any thing upon that head. His fir&s;t care at his entrance into the bu&s;ine&s;s of Printing was to get a font of the mo&s;t perfect round Roman, which however he made no u&s;e of in his books of divinity, the prevailing cu&s;tom of tho&s;e days being to print them in old Gothic. His next was to procure &s;ome of the be&s;t correctors of that age, of whom, tho' no per&s;on was more capable of correcting his works than him&s;elf, he had a greater number than any of his contempora|ries. Among the&s;e were <HI>Martin Dodo</HI> a prebend, <HI>Francis Wyler</HI> a learned Franci&s;can fryar, <HI>Conrard Pelican</HI> an eminent divine, <HI>Beatus Rhenanus</HI> and others. He was &s;o carefull and diligent in this province, that he would not let one &s;heet pa&s;s unrevis'd by him&s;elf. <HI>Reuchlin</HI> gives us this cha|racter of him in the preface to his book <HI>De verbo mirifico,</HI> that he was a man of an excellent genius, highly valuable for the neatne&s;s and correct|ne&s;s of his works, and well &s;kill'd in &s;everal arts and &s;ciences. His for|mer ma&s;ter <HI>Jo.

or more correctly printed than his. As <HI>Amerbach</HI> was a man of &s;in|gular piety and zeal for religion, which appears from all his prefaces, that &s;carce breathe any thing el&s;e; &s;o he rather cho&s;e to con&s;ecrate his labours to that, than any other branch of learning. This induc'd him to print the works of all the ancient fathers, a ta&s;k hitherto unattempted by any Printer. He began with an edition of St. <HI>Au&s;tin,</HI> which he fini&s;h'd not 'till the year 1505, in the old Gothic. But as he neither had a good manu&s;cript to print after, nor &s;ufficient a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the learned; we can only &s;ay that it was executed as correctly, as could be expected in tho&s;e times. What he had mo&s;t at heart was to publi&s;h St. <HI>Jerom</HI>'s works, which, as he knew was impo&s;&s;ible to be done without a competent &s;kill in the <HI>Latin, Greek</HI> and <HI>Hebrew</HI> tongues, the la&s;t of which he was too old and full of bu&s;ine&s;s to learn, he made his three &s;ons, youths of bright parts, divide that province among them&s;elves; who having &s;tudy'd tho&s;e languages, were oblig'd by him, whether he liv'd or dy'd, to fini&s;h that edition; which they faithfully perform'd. But as this ta&s;k, wherein he was engaged, was too large for one man, he took the learned <HI>John Fro|ben,</HI> whom we &s;hall mention hereafter, into partner&s;hip, and printed &s;eve|ral valuable and di&s;tinct volumes with him. The greate&s;t part of the&s;e particulars we have from <HI>Era&s;mus,</HI> in his prefaces to St. <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> and St. <HI>Jerom,</HI> which later edition he revis'd and publi&s;h'd <HI>anno</HI> 1515, with a dedication to the archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> He highly extolls the piety of the <HI>Amerbachs,</HI> he prai&s;es the father for having taken &s;uch care of his &s;ons education; and the &s;ons for the great progre&s;s they made in tho&s;e tongues, and for their piety in having &s;o exactly fulfill'd their father's de&s;ire, in the impre&s;&s;ion of a work, which had co&s;t them &s;o much money and pains; he frankly owns, that as he &s;tood in great need of &s;ome a&s;&s;i|&s;tance for the <HI>Hebrew</HI> tongue, &s;o he was chiefly beholden to tho&s;e three learned brothers for it <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><HI>D Era&s;m.</HI> praefat. ad <HI>S.

<HEAD>5. JOHN FROBEN, 1491.</HEAD>
<P>JOHN FROBEN was a native of <HI>Hamelburgh</HI> in <HI>Fraconia,</HI> where he &s;tudy'd 'till he became ma&s;ter of the <HI>Latin</HI> tongue, and afterwards went to the univer&s;ity of <HI>Ba&s;il,</HI> where he perfected him&s;elf in <HI>Greek</HI> al&s;o, and betook him&s;elf to the bu&s;ine&s;s of Printing, of which he &s;how'd him&s;elf &s;o good a ma&s;ter, that <HI>John Amerbach</HI> took him as a&s;&s;i&s;tant and partner in his laborious and expen&s;ive undertaking of publi&s;hing the ancient fathers, as we hinted before. He acquitted him&s;elf &s;o well both in this province and his own particular one, that he acquir'd as great a reputation and e&s;teem among the learned, as his contemporary and partner; to whom <HI>Germany</HI> is oblig'd for bringing thither the neat round Roman character, hitherto &s;carcely known there, and improving it to the la&s;t degree of per|fection. No per&s;on was ever more curious in the choice of the works, which he &s;ent to the pre&s;s, than he; who had this excellent quality among many others, that he would never print any bad books, &s;uch as the &s;or|did avarice of other Printers had over&s;tock'd the world with; but always cho&s;e the be&s;t authors, and be&s;t manu&s;cripts of them, &s;paring neither

co&s;t in purcha&s;ing them, nor pains in correcting and fitting them for the pre&s;s; in which, tho' he was a man of &s;ingular learning, yet he always preferr'd the advice and judgment of the learned of his time, to his own.

<P>THIS learned author, in one of his letters to <HI>Bilibaldus Parcheimerus,</HI> who was then at the emperor's court, complains highly of a great inju|&s;tice done to many good Printers in general, and to <HI>Froben</HI> particularly, which was, that he had no &s;ooner publi&s;h'd a good edition with great co&s;t and labour, but it was immediately reprinted by others, and &s;old &s;o much cheaper, that he could never reimbur&s;e him&s;elf half his charges.

<P>JO. FROBEN printed few volumes before the year 1500, and the num|ber of tho&s;e which are extant, is &s;till &s;maller. One of them was his concordance of the bible in <HI>fol. ann..</HI> 1495; concerning which we meet with &s;ome particulars, not unworthy the reader's knowledge, tho' a di|gre&s;&s;ion from our &s;ubject.</P>
<P>FIRST it was &s;o exactly printed, that there was not one error in all the numerical figures, which in a work of that nature are at lea&s;t one third part of the matter; and is therefore very &s;urprizing. <HI>Froben</HI> added a &s;econd part to it, which contain'd all the indeclinable particles, that are to be met with in the bible. This work was begun at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> by <HI>Jo. de Raguza,</HI> a Pari&s;ian divine of the Dominican order, emba&s;&s;ador
<PB N="224" REF="235">
from the council of <HI>Baden</HI> to the emperor <HI>Jo. Paleologus</HI> about the year 1436; yet he did little to it him&s;elf, but left it to his three chaplains, one of whom was a <HI>Scotchman</HI> nam'd <HI>Walter Sonaw,</HI> who fini&s;h'd it in almo&s;t three years. After this it was reduc'd into an alphabetical order, by the directions of that council, by <HI>John de Segovia</HI> or <HI>Secubia,</HI> archdeacon of <HI>Cujedo,</HI> and doctor of divinity. What gave birth to this &s;econd part of the concordance was no le&s;s remarkable, <HI>John de Raguza</HI> beforemention'd, coming to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> found the divines there engag'd in a very warm di&s;pute concerning the proce&s;&s;ion of the Holy Gho&s;t, <HI>i. e.</HI> whether from the Son as well as from the Father; and that the controver&s;y &s;eem'd chiefly to be about the particles <HI>ex</HI> and <HI>per, i. e.</HI> whether it &s;hould be <HI>ex filio</HI> or <HI>per filium.</HI> He was likewi&s;e inform'd, that the <HI>Sultan</HI> and all the <HI>Mahometans</HI> having heard, that <HI>Paleologus</HI> de&s;ign'd a journey into chri|&s;tendom, in order to reconcile this difference between the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> churches, had rally'd the chri&s;tians with no &s;mall &s;corn, whom two &s;uch &s;eemingly in&s;ignificant particles had divided to &s;uch a degree. This emba&s;&s;ador fail'd not to acquaint the council with it, who immediately order'd <HI>John de Segovia</HI> to be ready to an&s;wer all the difficulties, which the <HI>Greeks</HI> &s;hould propo&s;e at their arrival at <HI>Ba&s;il.</HI> In the mean time the <HI>Hu&s;&s;ites</HI> and <HI>John Hu&s;s</HI> of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> who were already at <HI>Ba&s;il,</HI> and in&s;i&s;ted upon a communion in both kinds from the words of our Saviour, <HI>Un|le&s;s you eat,</HI> &amp;c. and <HI>unle&s;s you drink,</HI> &amp;c. which their oppo&s;ers &s;aid &s;ig|nify'd no more than, unle&s;s you eat or drink, from which they concluded that either the one or the other was &s;ufficient to fulfill the command; the&s;e I &s;ay made it &s;till more nece&s;&s;ary to have a concordance, that &s;hould explain the meaning of tho&s;e particles <HI>ex</HI> and <HI>per, ni&s;i</HI> and <HI>et,</HI> and in how many different &s;en&s;es they were us'd in &s;cripture. This induc'd <HI>John de Segovia</HI> to write the &s;econd part of the concordance relating to indecli|nable words, with a prolegomenon or preface, in which he hath given us this account of the occa&s;ion of it. The learned <HI>Seba&s;tian Brant,</HI> author of the <HI>Navis &s;tultifera,</HI> caus'd it to be printed by <HI>Froben, ann.</HI> 1495, and &s;omewhat above twenty years after the &s;ame, <HI>Froben</HI> reprinted it with an elegant <HI>Latin</HI> dialogue between a book&s;eller and the buyer, relating to the value of good books, in&s;tead of a preface to that edition. The reader may &s;ee it at length in <HI>Chevillier,</HI> p. 130.</P>

<P>ERASMUS was not contented with writing the abovemention'd epitaphs in his late friend's prai&s;e, but he made likewi&s;e a kind of funeral oration or rather elogium upon him, in a letter to <HI>John Em&s;ted</HI> a learned <HI>Carthu|&s;ian;</HI> the reader may &s;ee it at full length in the above-mention'd <HI>Annals,</HI> vol. 2. pag. 36, <HI>&amp; &s;eq</HI></P>
<P>AND indeed it was no more than he ow'd him, &s;ince <HI>Froben</HI> had long before given him a plea&s;ure, which few men be&s;ide him had ever ta&s;ted, which was to &s;ee his own elegy before his death; the occa&s;ion of it was
<PB N="226" REF="237">
as follows. Before the&s;e two were become intimate, <HI>Froben</HI> had heard that <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> was dead, and wrote much &s;uch another funeral oration up|on him, which he prefix'd to an edition of that great man's proverbs, which he publi&s;h'd <HI>Ann.</HI> 1513: <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> could not but be highly pleas'd to &s;ee him&s;elf prais'd in &s;o extraordinary and &s;incere a manner, be|ing well a&s;&s;ur'd that &s;uch encomiums could not proceed from flattery or &s;elf intere&s;t; for <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> being &s;uppos'd dead, <HI>Froben</HI> could have nothing to hope from him; and had any but a man of <HI>Froben</HI>'s integrity and ho|nour committed &s;uch a mi&s;take, one might be apt to &s;u&s;pect it had been wilfully done, in hopes of procuring &s;ome valuable pieces from that learned author: but whoever is acquainted with that Printer's character, will undoubtedly believe him incapable of &s;uch mean arts. I think therefore it will not be ami&s;s to clo&s;e the hi&s;tory of this great Printer with &s;ome con&s;picuous parts of his character, which we have not yet touch'd upon, and which will ea&s;ily acquit him of any &s;u&s;picion; which is, that he was a man of the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted and generous di&s;po&s;ition. <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> in his letter to <HI>Em&s;ted</HI> abovemention'd does even tell us, that he was &s;o to a fault, and that he had often reprov'd him for it, but in vain, for his natural candor was proof again&s;t all admonitions of that kind: neither did his munificence to men of learning and merit &s;how it|&s;elf only in the largene&s;s of his pre&s;ents to them, but in the manner of be&s;towing them; never, &s;ays that author, did he &s;eem better pleas'd than when he had, either by intreaties or by &s;ome cunning device, pre|vail'd upon them to accept of &s;ome favour from him. The grief he &s;hew'd in his countenance at their denial was &s;uch, that they found it more dif|ficult to refu&s;e a favour from him, than to obtain one from another per|&s;on; and when by chance, continues he, I have bought me &s;ome cloath for a gown, he has privately &s;ent, and paid for it unknown to me. As his hou&s;e was open to all learned men, &s;o none had a heartier welcome than <HI>Era&s;mus,</HI> who us'd it as his home all the time he continued at <HI>Ba&s;il,</HI> and it is probable that he might have continued longer there, had he not ob|&s;erv'd &s;omething in his family, which he could not forbear grieving at. <HI>Froben</HI> was under petticoat-government, which made his affairs go &s;ome|what wrong, wherefore he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf thus to him in a letter da|ted from <HI>Louvain; Fama tibi parta e&s;t, ea poterit tibi magno emolumento</HI>

But <HI>Froben</HI> was of too ea&s;y and patient a temper, to give him&s;elf any trouble about it: we have a remarkable in&s;tance of this in the la&s;t year of his life, when being &s;eiz'd with &s;uch a violent pain in his right heel, that &s;ome phy&s;icians were for cutting off his foot, he had no &s;ooner receiv'd &s;ome ea&s;ement in it, than he went on hor&s;eback to <HI>Frankfort</HI> about &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s; and tho' advis'd by his friends to &s;tir &s;el|domer abroad, to go warmer in cloaths, and to &s;pare him&s;elf as much as po&s;&s;ible, he refus'd to hearken to them, and took &s;uch care to con|ceal his bad &s;tate of health, and the angui&s;h of his pain, that he went &s;till about his bu&s;ine&s;s; 'till being &s;eiz'd with a fainting fit, he dropt down and broke his &s;kull again&s;t the pavement; after which he continued two days, without any &s;en&s;e or motion, and expir'd <HI>ann.</HI> 1528. I hope the name and character of the per&s;on will excu&s;e my account of the&s;e particularities, e&s;pecially &s;ince the great <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> has thought them worth recording in a much ampler manner: he left two &s;ons <HI>Jerom</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> who became excellent Printers, and &s;ignaliz'd them&s;elves by their editi|ons of the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> fathers; he had likewi&s;e &s;ome daughters, one of whom nam'd <HI>Ju&s;tina</HI> he marry'd to <HI>Nicolas l'Eve&s;que</HI> or <HI>Epi&s;copius,</HI> an eminent Printer of <HI>Ba&s;il.</HI></P>

<P>THO' this city doth not &s;eem to have cultivated the Art of Printing within her walls, &s;o much as other cities of <HI>Germany,</HI> yet it ought to be remembred for having given birth to &s;ome eminent Printers, who went

<P>IT will not be improper to ob&s;erve here, that our late&s;t annali&s;ts place the city of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> under this year; the olde&s;t edition as yet di&s;cover'd by them being <HI>Socrates</HI>'s <HI>Sayings</HI> printed by <HI>Caxton, anno</HI> 1477; however the reader will find by the third book of this hi&s;tory, that there is a more ancient one by three years, <HI>viz.

<P>LYONS, a rich and populous city in <HI>France,</HI> upon the rivers <HI>Rhone</HI> and <HI>Arare,</HI> is call'd in <HI>Latin, Lugdunum,</HI> and is allow'd to be one of the mo&s;t ancient cities in <HI>Europe;</HI> &s;o that &s;ome <HI>French</HI> writers have not &s;cru|pled to fix the date of its foundation within 600 or 700 years after the flood, which may more ea&s;ily be believ'd than di&s;prov'd. It has been always eminent for men of learning in all arts and &s;ciences, which were particularly cultivated there, but more e&s;pecially after the Art of Prin|ting was introduc'd; which receiv'd &s;uch encouragement there, that it has continu'd in a flouri&s;hing condition ever &s;ince. Some annali&s;ts have a&s;&s;erted that it is the fir&s;t city in <HI>France</HI> which &s;et up a Printing-pre&s;s; but if we would judge of this controver&s;y by the dates of the olde&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ions,

we &s;hall find that the city of <HI>Tours,</HI> and next that of <HI>Paris</HI> had the Art &s;everal years before, as hath been already &s;hewn. However, if <HI>Lyons</HI> hath not the preference of <HI>Rome, Paris, Venice,</HI> &amp;c. either for the antiquity or beauty of its productions; it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd that it hath gain'd it by the quantity of large impre&s;&s;ions, than which no city in <HI>Europe</HI> has furni&s;h'd the learned with a greater number. It is &s;till a great <HI>emporium</HI> or market for books in all languages and &s;ciences; and as it hath encourag'd &s;ome of the be&s;t arti&s;ts to &s;ettle there, and pub|li&s;h beautiful and correct editions, &s;o it has induc'd many a wretched one to chu&s;e it as a proper place to print and vend a much greater quan|tity of bad and counterfeit ones; but this hath happen'd in mo&s;t famous cities of <HI>Europe. Lyons</HI> hath likewi&s;e been celebrated, if not for intro|ducing, at lea&s;t for encouraging, the <HI>Gothick</HI> character, and publi&s;h'd more volumes of that &s;ort, in proportion to tho&s;e that were done in fine Roman, than any other city; and what is more remarkable of the Prin|ters of this city, they were va&s;tly more fond of that inelegant character than of the Roman, e&s;pecially for bibles, divinity, law and phy&s;ick books.</P>

<P><HI>Badius</HI> was born in the ca&s;tle of <HI>A&s;e,</HI> in the territories of <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> and call'd <HI>A&s;cen&s;ius</HI> from it. He &s;pent his younger years in &s;tudy at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els, Gaunt,</HI> and la&s;t of all in the univer&s;ity of <HI>Ferrara,</HI> under the great <HI>Bapt. Guarini,</HI> where he became ma&s;ter of the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> tongues, and very famous for his learning and parts. He remov'd afterwards to the city of <HI>Lyons,</HI> where he publickly taught tho&s;e two languages, and became corrector to <HI>Jo. Trech&s;el</HI>'s pre&s;s, as has been &s;aid before. He publi&s;h'd &s;everal works, &s;ome of which were his own, as <HI>Silvae mo|rales contra vitia.</HI> fol. 1492. <HI>Epigrammatum</HI> lib. 1. <HI>Navicula Stultarum mulierum;</HI> the Life of <HI>Thomas a Kempis</HI> prefix'd to his works, and &s;ome others. Several excellent commentaries were likewi&s;e written by him upon the greate&s;t part of the cla&s;&s;icks, and other <HI>Latin</HI> authors, as <HI>Ho|race, Juvenal, Martial, Lucretius, Seneca, Salu&s;t, Valerius Maximus, Quintilian, Aulus Gellius,</HI> and others; all which he printed him&s;elf in <HI>folio</HI> very elegantly and correctly, tho' &s;ome of the fir&s;t he caus'd to be printed by <HI>John Trech&s;el,</HI> who&s;e daughter he afterwards married and had many children by her. To all his editions, which were not a few, he us'd to prefix an epi&s;tle dedicatory, addre&s;s'd to &s;ome per&s;on, eminent either for his quality, piety or learning. Among others, he dedicated the fir&s;t Volume of <HI>Tho. Walden&s;is</HI> works to pope <HI>Clement</HI> VII. After he had ta|ken the bu&s;ine&s;s of printing upon him; he became &s;o excellent a Prin|ter, that the learned <HI>Rob. Gaguin,</HI> general of the Trinitarian Order,
<PB N="237" REF="248">
who was perfectly well acquainted with his merit, wrote a letter to him, to de&s;ire him to undertake the printing of his works. This with &s;ome other invitations of the learned, brought <HI>Badius</HI> to <HI>Paris</HI> about 1499, pre&s;ently after his father-in-law's death, where he de&s;ign'd to teach the <HI>Greek</HI> tongue, and where his la&s;t endeavour, after he had fur|ni&s;h'd him&s;elf with fine &s;ets of Roman characters, was to explode the old Gothick both in his works, and by his example, as we hinted be|fore. And accordingly printed the <HI>Philobiblion</HI> of that great encourager of learning, <HI>Richard Bury,</HI> lord high chancellor of <HI>England,</HI> bi&s;hop of <HI>Durham,</HI> and founder of the <HI>Oxford</HI> library, towards the middle of the 14th century; which book was &s;ent to him by Dr. <HI>Bureau,</HI> bi&s;hop of <HI>Ci&s;teron,</HI> and confe&s;&s;or to the <HI>French</HI> king, in order to be printed by him. This was the fir&s;t book known that came to the pre&s;s after he &s;et it up at <HI>Paris;</HI> 'tis dated 1500; the next year he printed the <HI>Provinciale, &s;eu con&s;titutiones Angliae, cum Annotationibus Gullielmi Lindewode</HI> 1501, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> vol. fol. in a beautiful round Roman.

<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="article">
<HEAD><HI>Article</HI> 1. <HI>The Town of</HI> SONCINO, 1484.</HEAD>
<P>SONCINO is a town or ca&s;tle in the duchy of <HI>Milan,</HI> between <HI>Bre&s;cia</HI> and <HI>Cremona,</HI> and famous for being the place in which the fir&s;t <HI>Hebrew</HI> books were printed. The Chri&s;tians had hitherto e&s;teem'd &s;uch a de&s;ign too expen&s;ive and impracticable; it being &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to find arti&s;ts in tho&s;e early days, who could cut punches exactly enough in that difficult and unpractis'd character. Another difficulty, which &s;eem'd to them almo&s;t un&s;urmountable was, that to ca&s;t the letters with the points and accents, would multiply the ca&s;es to an exce&s;&s;ive degree; and to print without points, accents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> would have infallibly prevented the &s;ale of their books, becau&s;e few at that time, except the Jews, could
<PB N="247" REF="258">
read without them; and to ca&s;t the points and accents by them&s;elves, and interline them as now, &s;eem'd then perhaps wholly impractica|ble. We have &s;een under the article of <HI>Aldus Manucius,</HI> that he procur'd a fone of <HI>Hebrew</HI> types; but tho' the Jews had already printed at <HI>Soncino</HI> and el&s;ewhere for above twelve or fifteen years, which might have given him an in&s;ight into their method of printing in that language, yet he found it &s;o difficult, that he made but little u&s;e of them; and I can find nothing done by him in that kind, but an <HI>Hebrew</HI> alpha|bet, which <HI>Chevilier</HI> tells us is pre&s;erv'd in the <HI>Sorbon</HI> library. The Jews therefore, as they were the fitte&s;t for &s;uch a province, were the fir&s;t who &s;et about it. What encouragement they might receive from the Chri|&s;tians in &s;uch an undertaking, I cannot affirm; yet it is probable they might in a great mea&s;ure depend upon that; and without leave from the Pope and the Dukes of <HI>Milan</HI> they dar'd not have attempted it. Soon after the Jews had propagated this art into &s;everal cities of <HI>Italy,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>Bre&s;cia, Bologna, Rimini, Fano, Pe&s;aro,</HI> and even as far as <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> and <HI>Salonica,</HI> in all which places they in&s;crib'd their editions as done by &s;ome of the family of <HI>Soncino;</HI> the Chri&s;tians who now began to print in <HI>Hebrew</HI> in mo&s;t cities of <HI>Europe,</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> at <HI>Venice, Cremona, Mantua, Verona, Ferrara, Leghorn, Padua, Naples,</HI> &amp;c. in <HI>England, London</HI> and <HI>Oxford;</HI> in <HI>Germany, Ba&s;il, Frankford, Cologn,</HI> &amp;c. in <HI>France, Paris, Lyons,</HI> &amp;c. with &s;ome cities of <HI>Spain, Holland, Poland,</HI> &amp;c. &s;et up &s;ome ingenious arti&s;ts, who engag'd in that province; tho' it mu&s;t be own'd that the editions of the Jews were far preferable to tho&s;e for beauty and correctne&s;s. However there were few impre&s;&s;ions of this kind printed any where, but by the&s;e Jews of the <HI>Sontino</HI> family, 'till after the year 1500. Mr. <HI>Mattaire Ann. Typog.</HI> vol. 1. p. 152. makes a curious ob&s;er|vation after father <HI>le Long,</HI> which is, that in all the books that he had &s;een printed in this tongue before that year, as often as the name of God oc|curs in the text, they made u&s;e of the letter <HI>Daleth</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>He.</HI> Thus for in&s;tance they printed <GAP DESC="foreign"> for <GAP DESC="foreign">, and <GAP DESC="foreign"> for <GAP DESC="foreign">; for which no rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;ign'd.</P>
<P>I MUST not omit giving the reader an account, which we meet with in <HI>Buxtorf</HI> the father, of a book, that he tells us was in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Jo&s;eph Scaliger,</HI> of a much older date than tho&s;e of <HI>Soncino.</HI> It was an
<PB N="248" REF="259">
<HI>Hebrew</HI> grammar intitled <HI>Mahala Scevile Haddas,</HI> written by <HI>R. Mo&s;es Kimchi,</HI> which <HI>Buxtorf</HI> &s;ays had been printed in <HI>Sicily</HI> 152 years ago; <HI>Habuit Jo&s;ephus Scaliger impre&s;&s;um in Sicili&acirc; ante annos</HI> 152. (The&s;e words <HI>Buxtorf</HI> the &s;on did not alter, when he reprinted his father's book at <HI>Ba|&s;il, anno</HI> 1640 in 8vo.) This, if it be true, will oblige us to &s;eek much higher for the origin of <HI>Hebrew-printing,</HI> than the year 1484; which is the time wherein <HI>Rabbi Gedaliah,</HI> and after him the learned <HI>Bartolocci</HI> have affirm'd it to have begun; for if we &s;ub&s;tract 152 years from 1613 in which <HI>Buxtorf</HI> wrote, it will bring us to the year 1461. <HI>Chevilier</HI> p. 267 tells us, that he &s;aw a third edition of this grammar, printed at <HI>Ortona</HI> in the kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> in the &s;econd year of <HI>Charles</HI> king of <HI>Sicily</HI> and <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> i. e. <HI>anno</HI> 1496, which &s;hews that there mu&s;t have been two editions of it before; and <HI>Cornelius a Beughen</HI> in his <HI>Incunab. Typog.</HI> p. 126 mentions an old <HI>Hebrew</HI> edition printed at <HI>Bologna, anno</HI> 1471, with this title, <HI>R. Obadia Sephorno lux populorum. Liber Hebraicus &s;ic dictus, Bono|niae</HI> 1471. But as he doth not tell us in what library he met with it, and as we have not a &s;ufficient certainty of the truth of the dates of this and the other book mention'd by <HI>Buxtorf;</HI> I can &s;ee no rea&s;on for depart|ing from the epoch of our late&s;t annali&s;ts, to a&s;&s;ign a new one upon un|certain grounds.</P>

For &s;oon after the very infancy of Printing we meet with a great number of the&s;e engravers, who&s;e per|formances were va&s;tly &s;uperior to the be&s;t of tho&s;e in the foregoing li&s;t.

names and works will be &s;till valu'd by all &s;killed in that Art. Engra|ving upon wood became afterwards no &s;mall ornament to the Art of Printing, not only for the fine cuts with which the editions were inter|&s;pers'd, but likewi&s;e for the front, head and tail-pieces, initial letters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which in time became in great vogue.

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. <HI>Of &s;ome eminent Printers from</HI> anno 1500 <HI>to</HI> 1520; <HI>their Improvements to the Art; and their En|couragement from the Great and Learned; with a Catalogue of their mo&s;t con&s;iderable Impre&s;&s;ions in the Oriental Tongues,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE, in the introduction to this &s;econd book, given the reader my rea&s;ons for extending this hi&s;tory &s;o far beyond the year 1500; and I pre&s;ume that he is now fully &s;atisfied that it would have been im|perfect, if I had &s;topt there; &s;ince the far greate&s;t part of tho&s;e Printers, who &s;ignaliz'd them&s;elves, either for their learning or their indu&s;try, in im|proving every branch of Printing, appear'd not till the clo&s;e of that cen|tury, or the beginning of the next; and con&s;equently, he mu&s;t have known little of tho&s;e per&s;ons, to whom the world is particularly oblig'd for the va&s;t improvements to this Art. Upon this account I have con|tinued, in the preceeding chapters, the hi&s;tory of &s;everal famous Prin|ters to the end of their lives, tho' &s;ome of them &s;urviv'd even this epocha many years. But we omitted to give a li&s;t of their works beyond 1500,
<PB N="260" REF="271">
becau&s;e that would have &s;well'd this volume exorbitantly, and tho&s;e im|pre&s;&s;ions are le&s;s &s;carce than tho&s;e of the former century. We &s;hall add nothing therefore to their hi&s;tory, but proceed to do ju&s;tice to the me|rit of tho&s;e, who tho' they enter'd not this province, till after the be|ginning of the 16th century, yet may be ju&s;tly e&s;teem'd contemporaries with the former.</P>
<P>'TIS not however to be expected that we &s;hould pro&s;ecute the &s;ame method, as in the former chapters, by &s;hewing the progre&s;s of the Art thro' every city, much le&s;s by giving an account of every particular Printer, and the number of their impre&s;&s;ions; &s;ince &s;uch an hi&s;tory, how &s;uccinct &s;oever, would be too large for a &s;ingle chapter. Our de&s;ign is therefore only to mention the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Printers, and to point out the great improvements which each of them made to this Art, the encouragement they met with, and the noble impre&s;&s;ions in all languages, particularly the <HI>Hebrew, Chaldee, Arabic,</HI> &amp;c. (the fir&s;t of which had been ju&s;tly e&s;&s;ay'd, before 1500, but the other &s;carce attempted) with an account of the undertakers and a&s;&s;i&s;tants in that difficult province. For as to the beauty of the characters, whether Roman or Greek, they were brought to &s;uch a degree of perfection in the preceeding century by the <HI>Italians</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> as hardly admitted of much additional beauty.</P>
<P>TO proceed in order, we &s;hould begin with the Germans, to whom we owe the Art; tho' the Italians were the authors of tho&s;e improvements, which the former were too indolent in imitating; for the oriental tongues, and even the Greek, which the Italians had made a very con&s;iderable pro|gre&s;s in, was &s;till much neglected by them; &s;o that except <HI>Amerbach</HI> and <HI>Froben</HI> at <HI>Ba&s;il</HI> in <HI>Switzerland</HI> (which can &s;carce be call'd a part of <HI>Ger|many)</HI> who printed an <HI>Hebrew</HI> p&s;alter, and <HI>Era&s;mus</HI>'s <HI>Greek</HI> te&s;tament with his <HI>Latin</HI> ver&s;ion of it, <HI>anno</HI> 1586, we meet with but three eminent per&s;ons, who attempted to print in the Ea&s;tern languages. The fir&s;t is <HI>John Schott</HI> of <HI>Strasburgh, anno</HI> 1515, who printed <HI>Lucian</HI>'s dialogues of the gods in <HI>Greek</HI> with the <HI>Latin</HI> ver&s;ion of <HI>Othomar Nachtgall,</HI> with the title page in red, and &s;ome ornaments on the margin of the <HI>Greek</HI> text, and an <HI>errata</HI> at the end. By the compliments which the tran&s;lator makes him in the preface, he &s;eems to have been a very good Printer. He printed for
<PB N="261" REF="272">
<HI>George Maxill</HI> about five years before. His rebus or mark is in the table at the end of this book. The &s;econd is <HI>Eucharius Cervicorn (i. e.</HI> Harts|horn) at <HI>Cologn,</HI> who printed &s;ome <HI>Greek</HI> editions, the fir&s;t, <HI>anno</HI> 1517, is the <HI>Hours of the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin Mary,</HI> the <HI>&s;even penitential P&s;alms,</HI> and &s;ome litanies and prayers in <HI>Greek,</HI> with one or two more after. His types are tolerable, but the edition &s;omewhat faulty. The third is <HI>John Potken</HI> of the &s;ame city, who publi&s;h'd there a p&s;alter in <HI>Hebrew, Greek, Latin</HI> and <HI>Aethiopic, anno</HI> 1518, 4to. This per&s;on travell'd into <HI>India, Aethiopia, Aegypt,</HI> &amp;c. in order to become ma&s;ter of the <HI>Chaldiac</HI> or <HI>Aethiopic,</HI> and tran&s;lated the p&s;alter into that language, and publi&s;h'd it with the other ver&s;ions. He promis'd in his preface to perform &s;ome|thing likewi&s;e in the <HI>Arabick,</HI> if he &s;hould meet with &s;ufficient encourage|ment; but I do not find that he executed this. As for the Printer of this p&s;alter, his name is no where to be found in the book.</P>
<P>THIS is all I know of, that has been attempted by the Germans in that kind; tho' to do them ju&s;tice in another re&s;pect, they were indu&s;trious in printing <HI>Latin</HI> works that were very voluminous; particularly the <HI>De|cretum Gratiani,</HI> printed by <HI>Henry Egge&s;tein,</HI> at <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> which exceeds all that have been &s;ince printed for bulk; and <HI>Vincentii Speculum,</HI> by <HI>John Mentel,</HI> in ten large volumes, <HI>fol.</HI> In the following century they have been no le&s;s diligent, and publi&s;h'd a very con&s;iderable number of im|pre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>ITALY follows in cour&s;e; where, tho' great numbers of editions of the antient <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> writers, as well as of the modern, were publi&s;h'd; yet the <HI>Hebrew, Arabic,</HI> &amp;c. &s;eem'd almo&s;t wholly neglected. 'Tis true, that there had been, as we ob&s;erv'd, two <HI>Hebrew</HI> editions at <HI>Lisbon</HI> in <HI>Portugal,</HI> one <HI>anno</HI> 1491, and the other <HI>anno</HI> 1497; and that the Jews of <HI>Soncino</HI> had printed &s;everal <HI>Hebrew</HI> volumes there from 1485, to the clo&s;e of the century; and, having di&s;pers'd them&s;elves into other cities of <HI>Italy,</HI> continued printing their own books in that language. But with re&s;pect to the Chri&s;tians, no direct attempts were made that way, 'till <HI>Daniel Bombergh,</HI> an <HI>Antwerpian,</HI> &s;et up a Printing-hou&s;e for <HI>Hebrew</HI> at <HI>Venice.</HI> His fir&s;t work was the <HI>Hebrew</HI> bible, <HI>anno</HI> 1511, 4to, reprinted by him &s;everal times, and particularly <HI>anno</HI> 1518; in which year he likewi&s;e
<PB N="262" REF="273">
printed his <HI>Bibliae Hebraea Rabinica</HI> in <HI>fol.</HI> containing the <HI>Hebrew</HI> text of the bible, the <HI>Ma&s;ora</HI> and <HI>Targums</HI> of <HI>Onkelos, Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and <HI>Jonathan, R. Jo&s;eph,</HI> &s;irnam'd the <HI>Blind,</HI> and other <HI>Rabbi</HI>'s comments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which he dedicated to <HI>Leo</HI> X. But tho' <HI>Bombergh</HI> took a great deal of pains in this impre&s;&s;ion, and was him&s;elf a good ma&s;ter of the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> which he had learn'd of <HI>Foelix Praten&s;is,</HI> a learned <HI>Italian,</HI> who per&s;uaded him to undertake this edition, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in correcting it; yet the Jews &s;et no value upon it; but <HI>Rabbi Chajin</HI> prevail'd on him to print another in 4 vol. in <HI>fol.</HI> which he did <HI>anno</HI> 1525; and which was reprinted <HI>anno</HI> 1548. 'Tis not my bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire into the merit of tho&s;e editions; yet I cannot but ob&s;erve, after &s;everal great criticks, that the Jews have always &s;ucceeded better in works of this kind than the Chri&s;tians, as being more us'd to the niceties of the tongue, e&s;pecially in its points and accents. <HI>Bom|bergh</HI> continued printing in <HI>Hebrew</HI> near forty years; and all his works were highly e&s;teem'd on account of the beauty of the character and impre&s;&s;ion, their correctne&s;s, the finene&s;s of the paper, and the num|ber that he printed, which <HI>Jo&s;. Scaliger</HI> tells us amounted to above four millions of crowns of gold. He made u&s;e of the mo&s;t learned Jews for his correctors. His greate&s;t work was the <HI>Talmud</HI> printed <HI>anno</HI> 1520 in xi vol. <HI>fol. F. Bartolocci</HI> ob&s;erv'd, that after his death <HI>Hebrew-printing</HI> declin'd exceedingly.</P>
<P>THE next improvement of this Art was by printing <HI>Polyglot</HI> works; and herein the city of <HI>Genoa</HI> fir&s;t oblig'd the world. <HI>Peter Paul Porrus,</HI> a native of <HI>Milan,</HI> but inhabitant of <HI>Turin,</HI> an eminent Printer, under|took to print the<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Impre&s;&s;it miro Ingenio, <HI>Petrus Paulus Porrus,</HI> genuae in Aedibus <HI>Nicolai Ju&s;tiniani Pauli</HI> prae&s;idente Reipub. genuen&s;i pro Sere|ni&s;&s;imo Franc.

<P><PB N="263" REF="274">
THAT it is a compleat ma&s;ter-piece in that kind.</P>
<P>THE different di&s;po&s;ition of the columns are very regular and neat, and kept up to their exact proportions, nor having one double line in the <HI>Latin</HI> ver&s;ions, nor are any cha&s;ms or white lines &s;een throughout the work; &s;o that I dare affirm that to this time I have never &s;een a work &s;o well contriv'd, and &s;o completely fini&s;h'd. The <HI>Hebrew</HI> is printed with all the points, both orthographical and mu&s;ical, the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> is very neat, but above all the <HI>Arabic</HI> (allowing for its antiquity) &s;urpa&s;&s;es all I have ever &s;een of the kind; and, that nothing may be wanting to compleat the whole, the pre&s;s-work and ink, both rubricks and black, excels any thing I have &s;een, except <HI>Durand's Rationale,</HI> printed by the inventor, <HI>Fau&s;t,</HI> in 1459, which book I have al&s;o &s;een in my Lord's library.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Arabic</HI> was the fir&s;t that was ever printed, and this the fir&s;t piece of the bible that ever appear'd in &s;o many languages; for that of <HI>Potken</HI> at <HI>Cologn</HI> was not publi&s;h'd till two years after, and wanted the <HI>Arabic.</HI> The reader might rea&s;onably imagine, that this work met with de&s;erv'd encouragement; yet the rever&s;e appears from the ju&s;t complaints of the author. For <HI>F. le Long</HI> in his account of the po|lyglot bibles, p. 36, tells us, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'that he <HI>(Ju&s;tinian)</HI> caus'd no le&s;s than 2000 copies to be printed off, pre&s;uming that &s;uch a work would not only procure him a va&s;t reputation, but likewi&s;e prove very gainful to him; the profits of which he de&s;ign'd to be&s;tow upon &s;ome of his family who were then in want. He fancied that it would infallibly meet with a kind reception, and that all rich prelates and princes would think them&s;elves oblig'd to encourage it, and reim|bur&s;e and inable him to proceed with the other parts of the bible.'</Q> For this he promis'd in his preface to the p&s;alter; and, about twenty years after, in his annals of the Republick of <HI>Genoa,</HI> he propos'd to add the whole old te&s;tament in all tho&s;e languages to the new one, which was pre&s;erv'd there, done after the &s;ame manner; and this he would un|doubtedly have perform'd, had he not been unfortunately drown'd in his pa&s;&s;age to the i&s;le of <HI>Cor&s;ica</HI> the following year. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'But, continues <HI>Le Long,</HI> he <HI>(Ju&s;tinian)</HI> was deceiv'd by his too great credulity;
<PB N="264" REF="275">
every body applauded the work, but few proceeded further than that; &s;carce a fourth part of what he had printed was &s;old off.'</Q> He &s;ays afterwards, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'that, this p&s;alter being of no u&s;e to any except the learned, he found it impo&s;&s;ible to reimbur&s;e him&s;elf the expence he had been at; becau&s;e, be&s;ides the 2000 copies upon paper, he had about fifty printed upon vellum, which he pre&s;ented to all the kings, whether Chri&s;tians or Infidels.'</Q> <BIBL><HI>Vid.

<P>'TIS well that the author's di&s;appointment did not di&s;courage both him and others from attempting the like glorious performances: tho' we do not find any more works of that prelate in the oriental tongues, yet I have met with the following one printed at <HI>Paris,</HI> in 1516, which convinceth me, that he publi&s;h'd more of them, and in parti|cular that which is mention'd in it. It is entitl'd, <HI>Liber Job ad Hebraicam veritatem re&s;titutus, duplici Latina ver&s;ione, una vulgata, altera ex Hebreo Augu&s;tini Ju&s;tiniani,</HI> 4to, <HI>i. e.</HI> the book of <HI>Job</HI> re&s;tor'd to the <HI>Hebrew</HI> text, with a double ver&s;ion of it, <HI>viz.</HI> the vulgate, and another from the <HI>Hebrew</HI> by <HI>Augu&s;tin Ju&s;tinianus,</HI> 4to. But when and where <HI>Ju&s;tinian</HI> printed the book of <HI>Job</HI> in <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> I can no where find. As for <HI>Porrus,</HI> the Printer of the p&s;alter above mention'd, tho' he was paid by the Bi&s;hop who employ'd him, yet 'tis probable he ventur'd no more upon that province; for we do not find that ever he printed any thing more in tho&s;e languages, tho' he return'd to <HI>Turin,</HI> and printed for &s;everal years after. His mark or rebus was a leak with a <HI>P</HI> on each &s;ide, alluding to his name <HI>Peter Paul Porrus,</HI> as was the cu&s;tom of that time to find &s;ome bea&s;t, bird, plant, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that had analogy to the per&s;on's &s;irname, in order to form a rebus; as appears from the table of them at the end of this book.</P>
<P>THE next con&s;iderable work is the bible of that great <HI>Mecaenas,</HI> Cardinal <HI>Ximenes,</HI> archbi&s;hop of <HI>Toledo,</HI> printed at <HI>Alcala de Herares in Spain,</HI> in <HI>Latin Complutum,</HI> from whence it is call'd the <HI>Complutentian</HI> bible. But before we leave <HI>Italy,</HI> I &s;hall ju&s;t mention &s;ome other printers, who, tho' they did not excel in this kind, yet oblig'd the world with many noble volumes in <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek.</HI> Of this number was <HI>Andreas Azulanus,</HI> father-in-law to the great <HI>Aldus</HI> of <HI>Venice,</HI> who
<PB N="265" REF="276">
&s;ucceeded him in that Printing-hou&s;e, and kept up the credit of it for &s;everal years. His acquaintance with the members of the learned a&s;|&s;embly at <HI>Aldus</HI>'s hou&s;e, as well as with his other foreign corre&s;pondents, and his own extraordinary learning enabled him to print many noble editions, which it is not my de&s;ign to give an account of here, &s;ince they may be &s;een in Mr. <HI>Mattaire</HI>'s <HI>Annals,</HI> vol. II.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Junta</HI>'s at <HI>Florence,</HI> a noble family of Printers, &s;ome of whom we have &s;poken of under the heads of <HI>Florence, Rome, Venice</HI> and <HI>Lyons,</HI> &s;ignaliz'd them&s;elves in the preceeding and this century; parti|cularly tho&s;e of <HI>Florence</HI> were famous for their beautiful and correct editions in <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Lilly</HI> was their rebus, with this motto, <HI>Nil candidius,</HI> i. e. <HI>nothing is whiter;</HI> to which they &s;ometimes added the initial Letters of their names, and &s;ometimes printed them at length. There were two of them at <HI>Genoa,</HI> viz. <HI>Philip,</HI> who began to print in 1497, and continu'd till 1518, about which time he is &s;uppos'd to have dy'd, and <HI>Bernard Junta,</HI> but whether a brother or kin&s;man to him I cannot determine. The for|mer having cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect, that his works might be pirated, according to the cu&s;tom of tho&s;e times, obtain'd a patent from pope <HI>Leo</HI> X. of a ten years privilege for all the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> editions, which he &s;hould print from that time. As the former are all very curious and highly e&s;teem'd, I &s;hall give a li&s;t of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of them, which is as follows.</P>

<P>THIS is the la&s;t book which he printed; the next, <HI>viz. Florilegium diver&s;orum epigrammatum,</HI> &amp;c. 8vo, being printed by his heirs.</P>
<P>I SHALL mention but one more Printing-hou&s;e in <HI>Italy,</HI> viz. at the <HI>Quirinal-college</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> under the care of the famous <HI>Angel Gallotius,</HI> and protection of pope <HI>Leo,</HI> who was the founder of that college and Printing-hou&s;e, and among other marks of his favour, gave them a privilege of ten years for all their impre&s;&s;ions, &s;ome of which were ex|traordinary fine and correct, and revis'd by the learned <HI>Con&s;tantine La&s;caris,</HI> often mention'd in this book; of which number were the <HI>Porphyri quae&s;tiones Homericae &amp; de nympharum antro,</HI> &amp;c. and a very antient <HI>Latin</HI> tran&s;lation of <HI>Homer,</HI> both printed in 1517. <HI>Sophocles</HI>'s Scholia&s;t, 1518, and others of great value.</P>
<P>I SHALL now return to that famous bible of cardinal <HI>Ximenes,</HI> as I hinted before, commonly call'd the <HI>Compluten&s;ian</HI> bible, which is the only con&s;iderable one publi&s;h'd, either in <HI>Spain</HI> or any other part of <HI>Europe</HI> before that time. It con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ix large volumes in fol. the fir&s;t of which contains the new te&s;tament in <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> fini&s;h'd in 1517; the &s;econd is a <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Chaldee</HI> vocabulary of all the old te&s;tament with &s;ome other di&s;&s;ertations, fini&s;h'd <HI>May</HI> 31, 1515; the third is the <HI>Pentateuch</HI> in <HI>Hebrew, Greek</HI> and <HI>Chaldee,</HI> with a <HI>Latin</HI> ver&s;ion of each; the fourth is a &s;econd part of the old te&s;tament, and contains the books of <HI>Jo&s;hua, Judges</HI> and <HI>Ruth,</HI> the two books of <HI>Samuel,</HI> of <HI>Kings,</HI> and of the <HI>Chronicles,</HI> with the prayer of <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh,</HI> in <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Greek,</HI> with their <HI>Latin</HI> ver&s;ion; the fifth is the third part of the old te&s;tament in <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Greek,</HI> with the <HI>Latin</HI> ver&s;ion, and con|tains the books of <HI>E&s;dras, Nehemiah, He&s;ter, Job,</HI> the <HI>P&s;alms, Proverbs, Eccle&s;ia&s;tes, Canticles, Wi&s;dom of Solomon,</HI> and <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;ticus,</HI> the Apocry|phal part of <HI>He&s;ter</HI> only in <HI>Greek;</HI> the &s;ixth is the fourth and la&s;t part of the old te&s;tament in the &s;ame languages as the former, and contains the prophecies of <HI>I&s;aiah, Jeremiah,</HI> with the <HI>Lamentations</HI> at the end, <HI>Baruch, Ezekiel, Daniel</HI> (with the hi&s;tory of <HI>Su&s;annah,</HI> and of <HI>Bel</HI> and the <HI>Dragon) Ho&s;ea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Michah, Nahum, Ha|bakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zachariah, Malachi,</HI> with the three books of the <HI>Maccabees;</HI> the&s;e four la&s;t volumes were fini&s;h'd <HI>ann.</HI> 1517, <HI>July</HI>

the 10th; tho' Mr. <HI>Mattaire</HI> &s;ays, that the whole &s;ix volumes were not publi&s;h'd till the year 1520. Every page both of the old and new te&s;ta|ment is divided into three columns: in the old, the fir&s;t column contains the <HI>Hebrew</HI> text; the middle the vulgate <HI>Latin;</HI> and the third the <HI>Greek</HI> of the <HI>Septuagint:</HI> be&s;ides the <HI>Chaldee,</HI> which is plac'd in the inner margin with the ver&s;ion of it oppo&s;ite to it. The vulgate is printed with <HI>Gothic</HI> letter.</P>
<P>THE only objection again&s;t this work is, that the Printers made u&s;e of a &s;ort of fal&s;e letter to fill up the &s;paces, whenever any of the ver|&s;ions run to a greater length than the text; that there might be no line &s;horter than another, nor any blank &s;paces in the column. The new te&s;tament is in a very plain large character, without ligatures, abbreviations or accents; tho' that of the <HI>Septuagint</HI> is different; the rea&s;on of which they give in the preface, to the following purport; that &s;ince all the ancient <HI>Greek</HI> authors, whether &s;acred or profane, were originally written without them, they were unwilling to introduce any thing into tho&s;e holy books, which it is certain was neither origi|nally in them, nor of any u&s;e towards the under&s;tanding of them; but with re&s;pect to the <HI>Septuagint,</HI> which is but a tran&s;lation, they thought it unnece&s;&s;ary to be too &s;crupulous about it.</P>
<P>THIS work was printed by <HI>Arnold William de Bracario,</HI> in the uni|ver&s;ity of <HI>Alcala de Henares</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> at the charges and under the di|rection of that learned prelate, who&s;e merit in this re&s;pect can never be &s;ufficiently extoll'd. <HI>Alphon&s;us Zamora</HI> tells us, that he gave no le&s;s than four thou&s;and crowns of gold for &s;even <HI>Hebrew</HI> manu&s;cripts; and it would be difficult to determine the &s;ums, which the <HI>Greek, Chaldee</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> manu&s;cripts co&s;t him. As for the learned men, whom he &s;ent for from all parts of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in this undertaking, <HI>Malincrot</HI> tells us they were very numerous, of whom we &s;hall mention &s;ome. Among the <HI>Greeks</HI> were <HI>Demetrius Creten&s;is, An|tony Nebri&s;&s;enus, Lopes de A&s;tuniga,</HI> and <HI>Terdianus Pintianus,</HI> who were all profe&s;&s;ors of the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> tongues, and famous for their works. Of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> profe&s;&s;ors were <HI>Alphon&s;us Medicus,</HI> a native of <HI>Alcala, Paul Coronellus, Alphon&s;us Zamorali</HI> and <HI>John Vergera,</HI> to the
<PB N="268" REF="279">
la&s;t of whom was committed the tran&s;lation of &s;everal books, in which he re&s;tor'd a great number of texts, which were wholly unintel|ligible in the vulgate <HI>Latin.</HI> The&s;e, with many of the mo&s;t con&s;idera|ble men of the univer&s;ity of <HI>Alcala,</HI> were engag'd by the Cardinal with very large &s;alaries in this work, for the &s;pace of 15 years, <HI>viz.</HI> from 1502 to 1517; &s;oon after which he was prevented by death from executing &s;everal other glorious de&s;igns. A larger account of this work may be &s;een in <HI>Malincrot,</HI> p. 110. and Mr. <HI>Mattaire's Annals,</HI> p. 124, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>WHILE I am upon the &s;ubject of Polyglots, I mu&s;t not omit one great advantage which the art receiv'd from it, and which it hitherto wanted, <HI>viz.</HI> that of printing in columns, by which the text and ver|&s;ion are &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;pos'd, that the reader may at one view &s;atisfy him|&s;elf in any &s;cruple, that may ari&s;e either from a word wrong printed, or mi&s;under&s;tood in the one, by ca&s;ting his eye immediately on the other. This is particularly nece&s;&s;ary in <HI>Greek</HI> works and their ver&s;ions; in which when there happens to be &s;ome fault of impre&s;&s;ion, as 'tis almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible both text and ver&s;ion &s;hould be faulty in the &s;ame word, the one may be ea&s;ily corrected by the other. <HI>Chevillier</HI> gives us many re|markable in&s;tances of this, from pag. 240 to 243. I &s;hall only mention one of them, in which the Printer or corrector makes <HI>Aelian</HI> call all the greate&s;t and noble&s;t men of <HI>Greece</HI> errant lyars thro' every part of their lives <HI>[omnes Graecorum clari&s;&s;imi proe&s;tanti&s;&s;imique viri per totam vitam in extrema mendacitate ver&s;ati &s;unt]</HI> a reproach which neither the author nor tran&s;lator ever dream'd of fixing upon that nation. But upon a careful examination of the <HI>Greek</HI> text, the word appears to be <GAP DESC="foreign">, and con|&s;equently it &s;hould have been printed <HI>mendicitate,</HI> i. e. <HI>Poverty,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>mendacitate</HI> [lying] which e&s;cap'd the corrector's ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>THERE is another conveniency in this method, <HI>viz.</HI> that it obliges a tran&s;lator to be more conci&s;e, and to paraphra&s;e le&s;s, &s;ince the exor|bitant length of his ver&s;ion would be vi&s;ible at fir&s;t &s;ight. I have al|ready taken notice of <HI>Aldus</HI>'s method of Printing the text in one page, and the ver&s;ion in the other; but he was not follow'd in it by any Prin|ter that I know of: whereas as &s;oon as they had taken the hint of the&s;e columns from the Polyglot p&s;alter and bible, it was immediately
<PB N="269" REF="280">
follow'd by mo&s;t Printers; and the famous <HI>Badius,</HI> in his edition of <HI>Ange|lus Politianus</HI>'s works, <HI>anno</HI> 1519, printed all the epigrams and ver&s;ions after this manner. How plain &s;oever the advantages of this method may &s;eem, yet &s;everal men of learning have decry'd it; and particularly <HI>An|tony Muretus</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;. Scaliger</HI> have complain'd, that this way of printing the <HI>Greek</HI> and the ver&s;ion in two columns had been the cau&s;e of the for|mer being wholly neglected.</P>
<P>BESIDES books in two languages, the columns are very nece&s;&s;ary in large folio's, and &s;ometimes in large quarto's, where the lines run to &s;o great a length, that they puzzle the reader, who is apt to read the &s;ame line over again, or perhaps to &s;kip the next, unle&s;s he con&s;tantly keep his finger moving from one to the other; which is ea&s;ily remedied by dividing the pages into two columns. This method has obtain'd almo&s;t from the middle of the 15th century, and is entirely owing to that of printing the &s;acred books in &s;everal languages and columns. This &s;hall &s;uffice concerning this work printed in <HI>Spain;</HI> in which I find but two Prin|ters more of any note, <HI>viz. John Peter Bonhomin</HI> at <HI>Lisbon, anno</HI> 1514, where he printed a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> book, entitled <HI>Ordinationes,</HI> &amp;c. fol. in <HI>Gothic;</HI> and <HI>John de Porris</HI> at <HI>Salamanca,</HI> perhaps a relation of <HI>Peter Paul Porrus,</HI> who printed the p&s;alter at <HI>Genoa,</HI> mention'd before.</P>
<P>I COME now to &s;peak of the French Printers, who&s;e merit, tho' late, became at lea&s;t equal with that of <HI>Italy,</HI> or any other kingdom, in all re&s;pects. <HI>Henry Meibomius,</HI> a German hi&s;torian, owns, <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">&mdash;quod &s;cribendi genus ut <HI>Moguntiae</HI> in <HI>Germania</HI> inventum, ita apud <HI>Italos</HI> excultum, &amp; in <HI>Gallia</HI> demum per&s;ectum e&s;t. <HI>Chronic. Riddaggbu&s;en&s;.</HI> Tom. 3. p. 380.</NOTE>, <HI>that the Art of Printing, which was invented at</HI> Mentz <HI>in</HI> Germany, <HI>and improv'd in</HI> Italy, <HI>was at la&s;t perfected in</HI> France: which is &s;ufficiently evident from the im|pre&s;&s;ions of <HI>Henry Stephens,</HI> in <HI>Hebrew, Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> were there no other Printers to be produc'd in favour of that kingdom. But this cour|try has given greater encouragement, or abounded more in excellent Printers, than that; and con&s;idering the care the univer&s;ity of <HI>Paris,</HI> who&s;e power and authority over Printers and book&s;ellers we have given an account of under the article of <HI>Paris,</HI> had continually over them, and the many &s;ignal marks of their favour, join'd to the genius of the nation, we &s;hall not wonder at the pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">fection which they brought the

art to, tho' &s;omewhat later than their neighbours. For we may re|member that <HI>Badius,</HI> one of the fir&s;t who &s;ignaliz'd him&s;elf in this pro|vince, did not begin to print till almo&s;t the clo&s;e of the la&s;t century, nor come to <HI>Paris</HI> till the beginning of this. Hitherto, tho' the <HI>Roman</HI> character, and the elegant manner of printing introduc'd by the Ita|lians, were here exactly imitated, and in &s;ome ca&s;es excell'd; yet with re&s;pect to the learned languages, e&s;pecially the Ea&s;tern, they were much neglected throughout <HI>France;</HI> and tho' the noble <HI>Greek</HI> impre&s;&s;ions of <HI>Aldus,</HI> had rais'd an univer&s;al de&s;ire of reviving that tongue, yet the French were backward in introducing it, till they began to be contemn'd by the Italians, who were become every where ma&s;ters of it. The only pieces printed by them in that tongue till that time, were &s;ome quota|tions &s;o wretchedly perform'd, that Mr. <HI>Mattaire</HI> tells us, they were ra|ther to be gue&s;s'd at than read. The character was rude and uncooth, without accents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for which <HI>Badius</HI> makes an apology, and de&s;ires his readers to impute tho&s;e errors and omi&s;&s;ions to the &s;carcity of types, and want of compo&s;itors who under&s;tood in that language. <HI>Franc. Ti&s;&s;ard,</HI> a per&s;on compleatly &s;kill'd in <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Hebrew,</HI> and qualify'd for &s;uch a ta&s;k, reviv'd tho&s;e tongues, and prevail'd upon the Pari&s;ian Printers to intro|duce them, having printed &s;everal books in tho&s;e languages: whereas before this the expence of importing them from <HI>Venice</HI> was &s;o great, that it deterr'd many from the &s;tudy of them. At fir&s;t he addre&s;s'd a pathe|tic di&s;cour&s;e to the &s;cholars of <HI>Paris</HI> upon that &s;ubject; in which he re|pre&s;ents how contemptible their neighbours in <HI>Italy</HI> thought them; what epithets they gave their nation, &s;uch as, barbarous, proud and ignorant, who pretended to give laws to <HI>Italy,</HI> the mo&s;t learned and polite nation of the world, whil&s;t them&s;elves were not contented to de&s;pi&s;e the mu&s;es at home, but mu&s;t make excur&s;ions over the <HI>Alps,</HI> to di&s;turb them in their belov'd abodes there. He exhorted them to retrieve the honour of their country, and to apply them&s;elves immediately to the &s;tudy of tho&s;e languages; he promis'd them his own and other learned men's a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and tells them, that he had caus'd &s;ome <HI>Greek</HI> books to be printed, which, tho' cheap, would be great helps to them in that &s;tudy. In &s;hort, he laid before them &s;uch powerful motives, and convincing arguments, that he at length rais'd a de&s;ire in them of rivalling their neighbours for

learning. His extraordinary merit &s;oon procur'd him the e&s;teem and friend&s;hip of the great, who jointly a&s;&s;i&s;ted this noble de&s;ign; among whom was the duke <HI>de Valois,</HI> afterwards king of <HI>France,</HI> and &s;ufficiently known by the name of <HI>Francis</HI> I. the great patron of learning, who re|ceiv'd him into his family and protection.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t <HI>Greek</HI> book which <HI>Ti&s;&s;ard</HI> caus'd to be printed at <HI>Paris,</HI> was entitled <GAP DESC="foreign">, containing the &s;ayings of the &s;even wi&s;e men of <HI>Greece, Pythagoras</HI>'s golden ver&s;es, <HI>Phocylides</HI>'s ethic poem, and the ver&s;es of the <HI>Erithrean</HI> &s;ybil upon the la&s;t day, with a <HI>Greek</HI> alphabet and &s;ome other incon&s;iderable pieces. It was printed in 4to, <HI>anno</HI> 1507, by <HI>Giles Gourmont,</HI> and dedicated to the prince <HI>de Valois</HI> and the archbi&s;hop of <HI>Thoulou&s;e.</HI> This work was &s;o well receiv'd, that he caus'd the &s;ame Printer to di&s;patch three more books in that language the &s;ame year; <HI>viz.</HI> 1. <HI>Homer</HI>'s <GAP DESC="foreign">, 4to, or <HI>The battle of frogs and mice.</HI> 2. <HI>He&s;iod</HI>'s <GAP DESC="foreign">, 4to. 3. <GAP DESC="foreign"> or <HI>Chry&s;olaras</HI>'s <HI>Greek</HI> grammar, 4to. This la&s;t has a tetra&s;tich written by <HI>Cb. Rou&s;eau,</HI> to acquaint the world that <HI>Fran|cis Ti&s;&s;ard</HI> caus'd the fir&s;t <HI>Greek</HI> editions to be printed at <HI>Paris</HI> <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Primus Parrha&s;ia Graiae nova gloria linguae <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ti&s;&s;ard <HI>was a native of</HI> Amboi&s;e, <HI>in Latin</HI> Ambaca: <HI>for which rea&s;on the poet calls him here</HI> Ambacus.</NOTE> Ambacus Argivum concinet urbe melos: Quo duce morales Sophiae amplexabere leges; Hoc igitur &s;tabili pectore fige memor.</NOTE> ; which <HI>Ti&s;&s;ard</HI> him&s;elf took care to tran&s;mit to po&s;terity in &s;ome epi&s;tles prefix'd to the books above mention'd.

grammar with a <HI>Greek</HI> alphabet, and &s;ome hymns in <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> at the end; which book he dedicated to his great patron <HI>Francis</HI> prince <HI>de Valois. Giles Gourmont,</HI> who had printed his <HI>Greek</HI> works, likewi&s;e undertook the <HI>Hebrew.</HI> It is printed with his name; and tho' there is no date to it, yet it is plain it was publi&s;h'a in the year aforemention'd. However as he was the fir&s;t who merited the title of <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Hebrew</HI> printer to the city and univer&s;ity of <HI>Paris,</HI> and has publi&s;h'd &s;everal other <HI>Greek</HI> works after the year 1508, <HI>viz.</HI> the Idyls of <HI>Theocritus,</HI> &s;ome of <HI>Lu|cian</HI>'s works, a &s;econd edition of <HI>Chry&s;olaras</HI>'s grammar in 1511, the <HI>Gno|mologia</HI> and <HI>Aldus</HI>'s <HI>Greek Lexicon</HI> of 1497 much enlarg'd in 1512, the <HI>Grammar</HI> of <HI>Theod. Gaza</HI> in 1516, &amp;c. I thought my &s;elf oblig'd to do ju&s;tice to his merit. He us'd to put his coat of arms at the beginning or end of his books, and &s;ometimes at both, with this French motto; <HI>To&s;t ou tard, pres ou loing, a le fort du foible be&s;oing,</HI> i. e. <HI>&s;ooner or later, far or near, the &s;trong &s;tand in need of the weak,</HI> with his name <HI>Giles</HI> or <HI>Aegidius Gourmont.</HI> His mark &s;ometimes was the three crowns of the Kings of <HI>Cologn</HI> with the 25th ver&s;e of the 37th p&s;alm; <HI>I have been young, and now am old,</HI> &amp;c. in <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Greek,</HI> under them. He liv'd overagain&s;t the college of <HI>Cambray,</HI> in the &s;quare of that name; and his books are much valu'd by the lovers of antiquity, e&s;pecially at <HI>Paris.</HI> He continu'd printing till after the year 1527. As for the learned <HI>Ti&s;&s;ard,</HI> as we find nothing printed by him, after his <HI>Hebrew</HI> grammar, he is &s;uppos'd to have dy'd about that time.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, he did not want a &s;ucce&s;&s;or of equal merit to carry on this work; for <HI>Jerom Aleander,</HI> a per&s;on &s;o well &s;kill'd in <HI>Hebrew, Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> as to &s;peak them with as much fluency as his own lan|guage, was &s;ent for by <HI>Lewis</HI> XII. from <HI>Italy,</HI> where he profe&s;s'd the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> tongues with univer&s;al applau&s;e. His reputation was &s;o great, that the elector <HI>Palatine</HI> &s;ent his own brother <HI>Wolfgang de Ba|varia</HI> to be in&s;tructed by him, and the learned <HI>Vatablus,</HI> who had been formerly his &s;cholar, was proud to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in &s;ome of his works, and take care of their correction, whenever <HI>Aleander</HI> was hinder'd by &s;ickne&s;s or avocations. As &s;oon as he came to <HI>Paris,</HI> he employ'd <HI>Gourmont</HI>'s pre&s;&s;es in printing tho&s;e <HI>Greek</HI> works which we mention'd ju&s;t before in &s;peaking of that Printer. The King fail'd not of giving
<PB N="273" REF="284">
him immediate encouragement; for he &s;ettled on him a pen&s;ion of 500 crowns of gold, with many other marks of his favour; &s;o that he was cho&s;en principal of the college of the <HI>Lumbards,</HI> and, in 1512, rector of the unver&s;ity, with general applau&s;e; tho' he had not yet taken his do|ctor's degree there. At la&s;t he was made library-keeper to the pope, a bi|&s;hop and nuncio, and then cardinal, by <HI>Clement</HI> VII. I &s;hall only add, that he was one of <HI>Aldus</HI>'s learned academy; and that under his care the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Hebrew</HI> tongues were &s;o well &s;ettled in <HI>France,</HI> as to flouri&s;h there ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>BUT it mu&s;t be own'd, that tho&s;e editions of <HI>Gourmont</HI> were very far from perfection, &s;ince the types were ill &s;hap'd, the punches ill fi|ni&s;h'd, and the matrices wor&s;e &s;unk; be&s;ides which defects they had not ca&s;t a &s;ufficient font of types, and were for that rea&s;on oblig'd &s;ome|times to &s;top till a form was work'd off and di&s;tributed, before they could go on. Another defect in tho&s;e types was, that the accents not being ca&s;t to place between the letters as now, but by them&s;elves, and &s;o compos'd in intermediate lines, as the <HI>Hebrew</HI> points are done at this time, they were often plac'd over the wrong letters, and frequently confounded one for another, thro' the unskilfulne&s;s of their compo|&s;itors. <HI>Ti&s;&s;ard</HI> complains of this more than once, but tells his readers, that they were taking all proper means to remedy tho&s;e defects; and hopes in time, that tho&s;e characters would be brought to as great a perfection there, as in <HI>Italy.</HI> And indeed we find that the &s;ucce&s;s of <HI>Gourmont</HI>'s impre&s;&s;ions, under all the&s;e di&s;advantages, excited other printers in that city, to procure better types, workmen, correctors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (not to mention that beautiful font of &s;mall <HI>Greek</HI> which king <HI>Francis</HI> I. caus'd to be ca&s;t at his own charge) in which they &s;ucceeded to admiration, and &s;oon publi&s;h'd much finer editions than tho&s;e of <HI>Gourmont.</HI> We &s;hall only mention &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, tho' they all came out later than 1520, except <HI>Angelus Politianus</HI>'s epi|grams, printed by <HI>Badius</HI> in 1519, already &s;poken of in this chapter; and his edition of <HI>Guillelmus Budaeus's Greek</HI> epi&s;tles, 4to, in 1520. Af|ter this, <HI>Peter Vidoue,</HI> or <HI>Vidaeus,</HI> ma&s;ter of arts, and an eminent printer, printed <HI>Berault's Greek</HI> lexicon in fol. and <HI>Or. Apollo's Hieroglyphics,</HI> 8vo, in <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> in 1521 and 1523. <HI>Gourmont</HI> printed <HI>Homer</HI>'s fir&s;t
<PB N="274" REF="285">
and &s;econd <HI>Iliad,</HI> 4to, with <HI>Wolmar</HI>'s &s;hort notes; and the <HI>Greek</HI> lexicon of <HI>Magnus Chaeredamus;</HI> and in 1527, <HI>Gwinler's Greek</HI> &s;yntax, 8vo. <HI>Anno</HI> 1528 <HI>Simon Colinaeus,</HI> or <HI>de Colines,</HI> printed <HI>Sophocles</HI> tragedies, and in 1534, the new te&s;tament. The&s;e, with a few incon&s;iderable ones more, were all that came out in <HI>Greek</HI> during the &s;pace of 27 years, <HI>viz.</HI> from <HI>Ti&s;&s;ard</HI>'s fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion in 1507 to 1534; which I have men|tion'd here, tho' they run beyond our period, to &s;hew how &s;low their fir&s;t progre&s;s was, tho' their advances afterwards were prodigious. <HI>Chevilier,</HI> from who&s;e li&s;t I have extracted the be&s;t part of the&s;e edi|tions, has carry'd it on to the year 1560; and the reader will find, both in this piece and the remainder of it, &s;everal remarkable works omitted by <HI>Mr. Mattaire</HI> in his <HI>Annals,</HI> particularly the <HI>Greek</HI> lexicon and the new te&s;tament above nam'd. However as <HI>Chevilier</HI> tells us, that he &s;aw them all in the <HI>Sorbon</HI> library, I thought proper to mention them.</P>
<P>THE reader perhaps will be &s;urpriz'd to find nothing attempted by the Parifians in the polyglot way, whil&s;t the Italians, Germans and Spaniards &s;et them &s;o fair an example. But, whatever be the rea&s;on of this neglect, 'tis certain, that if we except the <HI>P&s;alterium quincuplex</HI> of <HI>Mr. Faber,</HI> or <HI>Fabry,</HI> printed in fol. 1509, by <HI>Henry Stephens,</HI> in <HI>Hebrew, Latin</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> with the <HI>P&s;alterium vetus &amp; conciliatum,</HI> in five co|lumns, and reprinted by him in 1513, and again at <HI>Caen [Cadomi]</HI> in <HI>Normandy,</HI> by <HI>Peter Olivier,</HI> in 1515, I can find nothing of that kind during the greate&s;t part of this century. However, it mu&s;t be ac|knowledg'd they have made the world ample amends in the next, in which <HI>Antony Vitr&eacute;</HI> printed that noble work, known by the name of <HI>Mon&s;ieur le Jay</HI>'s polyglot bible in 1657; which being of too late a date, and &s;o well known to the learned, I &s;hall only &s;ay of it, that as &s;ar as relates to the Printing part, (for as to the author's merit with re&s;pect to learning, 'tis not my province to enquire into) it has not yet been equall'd by any work publi&s;h'd, in any nation, either for beau|ty of character or elegancy of di&s;po&s;ition, finene&s;s of paper or richne&s;s of embelli&s;hment; in all which <HI>Mr. le Jay,</HI> who was at the charges of the impre&s;&s;ion, &s;par'd neither co&s;t nor labour, in order to render it a ma&s;ter piece of that kind. Here I mu&s;t draw a veil over my own
<PB N="275" REF="286">
country, which is greatly injur'd, if it did not contribute to the ruin of the undertaker of this glorious work. An intimate friend at <HI>Paris</HI> &s;ent me word, that the &s;heets of Mr. <HI>le Jay</HI>'s Polyglot was unfairly procur'd from the pre&s;s at <HI>Paris</HI> before the work was publi&s;h'd, and, by the editor's of the Engli&s;h Polyglot, improv'd and publi&s;h'd &s;o &s;oon after, as to reduce Mr. <HI>le Jay</HI> almo&s;t to want; after his having expended above 5000 <HI>l.</HI> &s;terling to compleat his work. But, as 'tis unplea&s;ant to relate, I &s;hall proceed.</P>
<P>As for the other printers who flouri&s;h'd at <HI>Paris</HI> during this &s;pace of 20 years, &s;ince my de&s;ign is only to mention tho&s;e who were emi|nent for improvements, unattempted in the former century, I have but few to add to the preceeding. The fir&s;t in rank and merit is <HI>Henry Stephens,</HI> the father of that numerous family of Printers, who&s;e learn|ing and impre&s;&s;ions for near 200 years have been celebrated by much better pens, and particularly by <HI>Mr. Bayle</HI> and <HI>Theod. Jan&s;on</HI> abroad, and by <HI>Mr. Nichols, Collier,</HI> but much more fully by the laborious and learned <HI>Mr. Mattaire,</HI> in his <HI>Vitae Stephanorum</HI> and <HI>Annales Typograph.</HI> I &s;hall therefore content my &s;elf with giving a &s;hort account of their great progenitor <HI>Henry,</HI> as far as relates to my pre&s;ent &s;ubject. He began to exerci&s;e the Art of Printing about 1502, in company with <HI>Wolfgang Hopyl,</HI> a noted <HI>German</HI> Printer at <HI>Paris,</HI> of whom we have given an account in the foregoing century. He had afterwards &s;everal other partners, <HI>viz. John Petit, Dennis Roce, John de Bri&eacute;</HI> and <HI>John Hongel,</HI> all eminent Printers. We have already &s;poken of his <HI>Po|lyglot P&s;alter,</HI> which, for ought I find, was the only piece he did in that way. As for the <HI>Greek,</HI> it was &s;o little in vogue in his time, that he printed but little in it. He us'd two &s;orts of characters for the <HI>Latin,</HI> viz the <HI>Gothic</HI> and <HI>Roman,</HI> both good in their kind. It were, &s;uperfluous to tell the reader, that he was a man of great &s;kill in the learned languages, and wrote &s;everal curious pieces in ele|gant <HI>Latin.</HI> He was extremely correct in his editions, &s;o that their faults are &s;o few, as &s;carce to de&s;erve an errata; yet he always rea|dily acknowledg'd the &s;malle&s;t number of them, as appears from his edition of <HI>Era&s;mus</HI>'s apology again&s;t <HI>Latomus,</HI> in which he confe&s;&s;es,
<PB N="276" REF="287">
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Locis aliquot incuria no&s;tra aberratum e&s;t.</NOTE> <HI>that &s;ome &s;aults e&s;cap'd him thro' neglect;</HI> tho' the whole was but twenty. Hi chief correctors were <HI>Peter Porta, Volgatius Praten&s;is, John Solidus</HI> of <HI>Cracow</HI> in <HI>Poland,</HI> and <HI>Beatus Rhenanus.</HI> As he was &s;worn Printer of the city of <HI>Paris,</HI> in&s;tead of a mark or rebus, he us'd to put the arms of that univer&s;ity to his impre&s;&s;ions, which is the e&s;cutcheon of <HI>France,</HI> with a hand from the clouds holding a book. Several other printers of that city follow'd his example in this. He dy'd in 1520, leaving among other children three &s;ons, who became very eminent, <HI>vid. Mattaire Vit. Steph.</HI> the two fir&s;t <HI>Robert</HI> and <HI>Francis</HI> in printing, and <HI>Charles</HI> in phy&s;ick.</P>
<P>HIS &s;ucce&s;&s;or was <HI>Simon de Colines,</HI> or <HI>Colinaeus,</HI> who marry'd his relict, and educated his two &s;ons before mention'd; and with them rais'd the reputation of his Printing-hou&s;e higher, than their father could, whil&s;t the learned languages were in their infancy there. I &s;hall only add, that <HI>Robert</HI> became &s;o great a proficient under his father and father-in-law, that he was able to manage that great Printing|hou&s;e at the age of 18; and that one of his editions of the new te&s;ta|ment in 16^o. <HI>ann,</HI> 1549, printed in a very fine <HI>Greek</HI> character, and ve|ry &s;carce, is affirm'd to be without a fault. This de&s;erves notice, becau&s;e there is another of his likewi&s;e in 16^o, 1546, which has an errata at the end, and is frequently &s;old for the other. I cannot but ob&s;erve, that to this <HI>Robert Stephens</HI> we owe the invention of dividing the chapters of the bible into ver&s;es, found out by him on a journey from <HI>Paris</HI> to <HI>Lyons,</HI> as we are inform'd by <HI>Theod. Jan&s;on de Vit. Stephanorum,</HI> printed at <HI>Am&s;terdam ann.</HI> 1643, pag. 48; the great advantage of which is obvious to every per&s;on.</P>
<P>BEFORE I di&s;mi&s;s the city of <HI>Paris,</HI> I cannot forbear mentioning a mo&s;t curious and elaborate work, which tho' not printed till the year 1529, yet, both for its &s;ingularity and its having been begun many years before, ought by no means to be omitted, I mean the book entitled <HI>Champ-Fleury,</HI> written by the famous <HI>Godfrey Tory,</HI> printer and book&s;eller of the city of <HI>Bourges,</HI> at the &s;ign of the broken pitcher, and printed by <HI>Giles Gourmont</HI> likewi&s;e, Printer and book&s;eller at <HI>Paris,</HI> under the following title;</P>

II. part 2. from page 550 to 559, where he will find &s;uch particularities both of the book and its author, as he will think worth reading, if he has any ta&s;te in this way.</P>
<P>I HAVE already dwelt &s;o long upon the &s;ubject of Polyglots, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable improvement of the Art in this century; and upon the city of <HI>Paris,</HI> the mo&s;t celebrated in <HI>France</HI> for productions of that kind; that I &s;hall &s;carce have room to &s;peak of <HI>Lyons, Rouen, Tholou&s;e, Caen,</HI> &amp;c. which have produc'd many excellent works, if not in the Polyglot way, yet in all branches of the Art. I &s;hall confine my &s;elf therefore to tho&s;e Printers who have cultivated the <HI>Greek</HI> or Oriental tongues, and refer the re&s;t to Mr. <HI>Mattaire</HI>'s <HI>Annals,</HI> where the reader may &s;ee their merit, and the li&s;t of their impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>THE city of <HI>Lyons</HI> has been always the next in rank to <HI>Paris,</HI> in every branch of Printing; and if we con&s;ider that it receiv'd le&s;s encourage|ment from their princes and the learned, the latter chu&s;ing to re&s;ide at <HI>Paris,</HI> where there was a greater probability of advancement, we &s;hall wonder that <HI>Lyons</HI> was &s;o little inferior to <HI>Paris;</HI> and may remember, that it produc'd many valuable impre&s;&s;ions during the la&s;t century. However, the reader mu&s;t not expect any productions in <HI>Greek,</HI> much le&s;s in <HI>Hebrew</HI> and the Polyglot kind, during the&s;e 20 years, or long after, &s;ince he has &s;een the &s;low progre&s;s of tho&s;e languages at <HI>Paris;</HI> and with re&s;pect to the <HI>Latin</HI> and modern tongues, they are foreign to our pre|&s;ent
<PB N="278" REF="289">
purpo&s;e. I &s;hall therefore only &s;ay, that the <HI>Lyons</HI> Printers publi&s;h'd many editions of the cla&s;&s;ics, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> law-books, and e&s;pecially <HI>Latin</HI> bi|bles, there being &s;carce a year pa&s;t for a long time, in which they did not print two or three of them of different ver&s;ions, and &s;ome with very fine rubricks and other curious embelli&s;hments. The mo&s;t remarkable Printers of them were <HI>James Sacon,</HI> or <HI>Sachon,</HI> who printed &s;ome works of the fathers, and one time two <HI>Latin</HI> bibles in one year; <HI>James Mare&s;chall, John Moylin</HI> and <HI>Nicholas de Benedictis.</HI></P>
<P>THE city of <HI>Rouen,</HI> in <HI>Latin Rothomagium,</HI> and <HI>Caen</HI> follow next: but their productions for the&s;e twenty years, and after, are &s;o incon&s;ide|rable, if we except a <HI>Latin</HI> bible in 4to, <HI>anno</HI> 1511, and the <HI>P&s;alterium quincuplex</HI> of <HI>Faber</HI> aforemention'd, which was printed in the latter <HI>anno</HI> 1515, both by <HI>Peter Olivier,</HI> and a <HI>Latin</HI> bible in the former; that I &s;hall in&s;i&s;t no longer upon them. With re&s;pect to the other cities of <HI>France,</HI> which receiv'd the Art either before or after the clo&s;e of the la&s;t century, their impre&s;&s;ions are &s;till le&s;s con&s;iderable. I now pa&s;s there|fore to <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> where the reader will be &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee the Art rather &s;unk and lo&s;t than improv'd. In the preceeding cen|tury we find &s;everal cities in <HI>Holland,</HI> as <HI>Utrecht</HI> 1473, <HI>Delph</HI> 1477, <HI>Goude</HI> 1479, <HI>Harlem</HI> 1485, and <HI>Leyden</HI> 1497, receiv'd and cultivated the Art; yet now we meet not with a &s;ingle edition done in any of them; nor find that any other city receiv'd it during tho&s;e twenty years. As for <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Brabant,</HI> 'tis manife&s;t they have been le&s;s neg|ligent than the <HI>Dutch;</HI> for the city of <HI>Antwerp</HI> entertain'd one or two Printers, who publi&s;h'd three or four books during this &s;pace; the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of which was the new Te&s;tament in <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> in 4to, <HI>anno</HI> 1509; and the univer&s;ity of <HI>Louvain</HI> had an eminent Printer, <HI>Theodore Martin,</HI> who, having printed at his own native town of <HI>Alo&s;t</HI> 'till the end of the 15th century, remov'd to <HI>Antwerp,</HI> where he pub|li&s;h'd &s;ome <HI>Latin</HI> editions, and at length came hither and continued prin|ting till 1528, or perhaps longer. His impre&s;&s;ions in this city are not in|deed very remarkable for their bulk, beauty or number. I find but nine or ten, mo&s;t of which are &s;chool-books, either written or publi&s;h'd by <HI>Era&s;mus;</HI> yet his mo&s;t con&s;iderable work is the <HI>Latin</HI> te&s;tament in 8vo, <HI>anno</HI> 1519, if it was printed by him, as is probable, &s;ince we find
<PB N="279" REF="290">
no other Printer here during this &s;pace, tho' <HI>F. le Long</HI> mentions not the Printer's name.</P>
<P>AS for the other cities, which receiv'd the Art before 1500, as <HI>Bru|ges, Alo&s;t, Bru&s;&s;els, Gaunt, Boi&s;leduc,</HI> &amp;c. we find &s;o profound a &s;ilence among the annali&s;ts and hi&s;torians, as makes me &s;u&s;pect that it either ceas'd entirely there, or that their produce was not worth pre&s;erving, unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e that they were lo&s;t in the war, of which this country was the &s;eat in tho&s;e times; which is evidently the ca&s;e of other coun|tries, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e upon the <HI>Rhine, Switzerland,</HI> &amp;c. Some emi|nent authors have told us, that they purchas'd &s;ome of tho&s;e valuable pieces, which had been plunder'd by the &s;oldiers, during the wars, out of the libraries of the monks and others. If this be fact, 'tis &s;trange that <HI>Louvain,</HI> which calls it&s;elf the <HI>maiden city,</HI> becau&s;e it was never taken by any foreign power, &s;hould not have pre&s;erv'd &s;ome more valuable im|pre&s;&s;ions than tho&s;e of <HI>Theod. Martin,</HI> ju&s;t mention'd. However, to do ju&s;tice to the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> e&s;pecially, I mu&s;t &s;ay, that how negligent &s;oever they were at fir&s;t in this re&s;pect, they have &s;ufficiently oblig'd the world &s;ince by their improvements to this Art; nor need I tell the reader how much they have excell'd the Engli&s;h in the goodne&s;s of their paper, beauty and variety of characters, and in elegance and correctne&s;s of compo&s;ition; in &s;hort, how they have equall'd any nation of <HI>Europe</HI> in every branch of Printing &s;ince. In the &s;econd volume we &s;hall &s;hew what improvements they have made to the mechanic part of it, and in parti|cular to the Printing-pre&s;s, cha&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the former of which is &s;o com|pleat, as &s;carce to admit a greater degree of perfection.</P>
<P>HERE I cannot but ob&s;erve the &s;trange vici&s;&s;itudes that have attended this Art &s;ince its fir&s;t invention. We have &s;een how diligent the Italian nation has been in improving it, what quick progre&s;s they made in it, and to what a degree of perfection they brought it even before the clo&s;e of the 15th century; whereas &s;carce any nation in <HI>Europe</HI> has neglected it more within the&s;e hundred years, having &s;uffer'd their elegant Roman and Italick to degenerate, and are become very carele&s;s in their com|po&s;itions, ornaments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;o that they are almo&s;t inferior to any coun|try in all the branches of Printing. The French, on the contrary, who did not introduce the fine <HI>Venetian Roman, Italick,</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> 'till late in the
<PB N="280" REF="291">
16th century, have been allow'd the be&s;t Printers, 'till <HI>Elzevir</HI> aro&s;e; &s;ince which time the Dutch, who were by far the late&s;t of any nation in <HI>Europe</HI> in bringing it to the perfection which their neighbours had, have been lately &s;uperior to all. I &s;hall &s;ay but little of <HI>England,</HI> where every reader is already &s;en&s;ible what rank our Printers here de&s;erve with re&s;pect to other countries; but 'tis with the utmo&s;t regret that I ob&s;erve our nation, which took &s;o much pains to have the Art brought over in its earlie&s;t days, and cultivated it with &s;o much application, &s;hould have been &s;o far excell'd by the French and Dutch Printers, and even by tho&s;e of our own nation, who liv'd a century and a half ago. But were the reader con&s;cious of the di&s;advantages we labour under, and the &s;mall Profit we reap from our labour, he would rather be apt to wonder that any of us have been able to keep it up to that degree of perfection it is &s;till in. I could ea&s;ily make it appear from whence the&s;e difficulties ari&s;e. This complaint, which is far from being new, the <HI>Latin</HI> reader will find ele|gantly expre&s;s'd above 150 years ago by <HI>Cornelius Kelian,</HI> one of the great <HI>Plantine</HI>'s correctors, in an epigram of &s;ixteen ver&s;es, which I have &s;ubjoin'd at the bottom of the page <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><HI>Typographus Mercenarius.</HI>

<P>BUT to return from this digre&s;&s;ion, which I hope will merit the reader's pardon, I &s;hall now mention &s;ome cities in other kingdoms, which receiv'd the Art after the 15th century, and conclude this chap|ter with &s;ome remarks on the &s;ucce&s;s of it in other parts of the world.</P>
<P>HITHERTO we have not &s;een that any Printer ventur'd farther North than the empire of <HI>Germany.</HI> As for the kingdoms of <HI>Poland, Sweden,</HI>
<PB N="281" REF="292">
<HI>Denmark,</HI> &amp;c. they imported books from <HI>Germany</HI> and other countries, and tran&s;mitted any works thither, which they wanted to have printed. I can find no city in tho&s;e parts, except <HI>Cracow,</HI> the metropolis of <HI>Poland,</HI> that receiv'd it &s;o &s;oon as 1520; and even in this we have but one in|con&s;iderable impre&s;&s;ion done in 1518, <HI>viz.</HI> a diary of <HI>Sigi&s;mund,</HI> the king of <HI>Poland</HI>'s nuptials, printed by one <HI>Jerom Victor,</HI> in 4to. I &s;hall there|fore pa&s;s over to <HI>Turky;</HI> were we find &s;ome of the di&s;pers'd <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>Soncino,</HI> and particularly Rabbi <HI>Ger&s;on,</HI> who, as we gave an account under the article of that place, brought the art to <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> whil&s;t others &s;ettled at <HI>The&s;&s;alonica</HI> and other parts, of which we have but a &s;mall account, and carry'd on the bu&s;ine&s;s of printing with good &s;uc|ce&s;s. But it mu&s;t not be &s;uppos'd that the <HI>Turks</HI> invited them or any other Printers thither, much le&s;s that they gave them any other encou|ragement than a large toleration. On the contrary, we have &s;hewn in a former chapter, how Sultan <HI>Bajazet</HI> II. publi&s;h'd an edict in 1483, again&s;t the u&s;e of printed books under pain of death; which edict was afterwards confirm'd by <HI>Selim</HI> I. his &s;on. The encouragement there|fore which they receiv'd was from the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> and <HI>Jews;</HI> the latter undoubtedly were pleas'd to have their own books at a more moderate rate, than when they were only tran&s;crib'd; and the former, being willing not only to have the old Te&s;tament printed by them more cor|rect than the editions of <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Printers, but likewi&s;e to have it di&s;|pers'd among the <HI>Turks, Indians,</HI> &amp;c. who were wholly ignorant of tho&s;e important truths contain'd in it, &s;par'd no co&s;t to purcha&s;e them. Be&s;ides this, their <HI>Targums, Talmud,</HI> and other <HI>Rabbinical</HI> learning were brought up by the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> to furni&s;h them&s;elves with what arguments they cou'd, again&s;t that poor infatuated people, out of their own books. And perhaps this might be the main motive which induc'd tho&s;e two Sultans to publi&s;h &s;o &s;evere an edict again&s;t printing any books in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> language, &s;ince the aver&s;ion of that nation to almo&s;t every branch of learning, and e&s;pecially the religious, is &s;ufficiently known.</P>

<P>THO' the&s;e be all that we can yet find to have been printed in <HI>Turky</HI> from 1500 to 1620; yet I cannot per&s;uade my&s;elf, that they were all which the <HI>Jews</HI> printed there, but am apt to believe, that they were bought up by the ea&s;tern <HI>Chri&s;tians, Jews,</HI> &amp;c. and carried to the re|mote parts of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Africa;</HI> whil&s;t the <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>Soncino</HI> and others were grown &s;o numerous as to &s;upply tho&s;e countries with works of that kind. However that be, I do not find that this art made any further progre&s;s in the&s;e parts of the world during this &s;pace, or at lea&s;t that tho&s;e authors, who have repre&s;ented its advances greater, have been much depended on by tho&s;e that wrote after them; and therefore I think my&s;elf obliged to &s;top here.</P>
<P>I HAVE already tran&s;gre&s;s'd my propos'd limits, as often as the life of any eminent Printer has extended beyond them, or any material occurrence happen'd worthy of the reader's notice. Agreeable to which liberty, I &s;hall now clo&s;e this chapter with &s;ome remarks on the &s;ucce&s;s which attended the art, tho' at &s;ome di&s;tance of time from the year 1520. Fir&s;t 'tis ob&s;ervable, that it has extended it&s;elf to <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>America;</HI> not indeed at the invitation of the natives, e&s;pecially of
<PB N="283" REF="294">
<HI>America,</HI> but by means of the <HI>Europeans,</HI> and particularly of the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI> mi&s;&s;ionaries; who carry'd it to the latter for their ends, where it has throve, tho' not flouri&s;h'd ever &s;ince. The <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> &s;ociety <HI>de pro|pagando fide,</HI> gives us an account of printing-hou&s;es being &s;et up in the cities of <HI>Goa, Rachol,</HI> in the country of <HI>Sal&s;etta, Manella,</HI> the me|tropolis of the <HI>Philippine</HI> i&s;lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the fir&s;t of which were printed the two following works, <HI>viz. Doctrina Chri&s;tiana lingua Malabarica Tamul et litteris Malabaris in collegio Goano,</HI> 1577. This edition was in <HI>Scaliger</HI>'s po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and is now among tho&s;e which he bequeath'd to the univer&s;ity of <HI>Leyden.</HI> The other is part of <HI>Confucius</HI>'s works printed likewi&s;e at <HI>Goa</HI> in 1569; a copy of which is now in the empe|ror's library at <HI>Vienna.</HI> We find al&s;o &s;ome printing-hou&s;es &s;et up a|bout this time in the city of <HI>Lima,</HI> capital of the empire of <HI>Peru,</HI> and in &s;everal cities of the kingdom of <HI>Mexico.</HI> I &s;hall only add, that our honourable &s;ociety for the propagation of the go&s;pel in foreign parts, having heard of the good &s;ucce&s;s, which Mr. <HI>Zidgenbalgh</HI> and Mr. <HI>Grundler,</HI> two <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> mi&s;&s;ionaries, &s;ent to the coa&s;t of <HI>Tanquebar</HI> by his <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> maje&s;ty, had in converting a great number of the natives of that country to the chri&s;tian faith, were pleas'd to &s;end them the whole apparatus of a printing-hou&s;e, with proper workmen and large quantities of paper, which they thankfully receiv'd, and immediately &s;et to work, having &s;ince printed a fine quarto New Te&s;tament, pray|er-books, catechi&s;ms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> and &s;everal ea&s;tern languages and characters, for the promoting of their pious de&s;ign.</P>
<P>To return again to <HI>Europe,</HI> the Printers, who fir&s;t introduc'd the art into <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> about 1560, were le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful. That nation was too little friendly to learning to give it any encourgement; and even &s;uffer'd both the printing-hou&s;e and its whole apparatus to be burn'd and de&s;troy'd, without ever enquiring after the authors of the mi&s;chief. The famous <HI>Thevet,</HI> hi&s;toriographer to <HI>Henry</HI> III. of <HI>France,</HI> and a great traveller, gives us the following account of it: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'As for the Art of Printing, they (the <HI>Mu&s;covites)</HI> had not the u&s;e of it till 1560; when it was di&s;cover'd to them by a <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> merchant, who bought a num|ber of types, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with which many neat editions were printed. Ne|verthele&s;s, as they are a very &s;uper&s;titious nation, and apt to rai&s;e &s;cru|ples

without any foundation, in which they imitate their followers of the <HI>Greek</HI> church; &s;ome of them hir'd &s;everal fellows privately to burn all their characters, apprehending that printing might make &s;ome change or confu&s;ion in their religion. And yet not the lea&s;t enquiry or pro&s;ecution was made after this, either by the prince or his Subjects.'</Q> But &s;ince that time they have admitted it into their metropolis of <HI>Mo&s;cow,</HI> and el&s;ewhere in the la&s;t century, tho' they print but little, and &s;ell at exce&s;&s;ive rates.</P>
<P>I HAVE already hinted, that the emperor of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> and monarch of tho&s;e chri&s;tians, that are commonly known by the name of <HI>Aby&s;&s;ines,</HI> who is fal&s;ly call'd by &s;ome writers <HI>Pre&s;ter John,</HI> wrote a letter in 1521, to Don <HI>Manuel,</HI> king of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and another in 1524 to his &s;ucce&s;&s;or <HI>John</HI> III. (which letters are to be &s;een in the <HI>Hi&s;pania illu&s;trata,</HI> tran&s;lated by <HI>Paul Jovius,</HI> tom. 2. p. 1293, 1297,) in which he de&s;ires tho&s;e princes to &s;end him &s;ome of the mo&s;t curious artificers of <HI>Europe;</HI> and in the latter he &s;ays thus: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I entreat you, my lord and brother, to &s;end me &s;ome workmen to carve images, to ca&s;t books, make &s;words and all &s;orts of weapons; likewi&s;e ma&s;ons, carpenters, phy&s;icians, &s;ur|geons, apothecaries, coiners of gold and &s;ilver, and per&s;ons who un|der&s;tand how to extract gold, &s;ilver, and copper out of the mines, to cover hou&s;es with lead, to make &s;hields and muskets; and in &s;hort, all &s;orts of nece&s;&s;ary workmen.'</Q> What &s;ucce&s;s the&s;e letters had, and whether king <HI>John</HI> an&s;wer'd his reque&s;t in any of the&s;e particulars, I cannot determine.

<HEAD>CHAP VIII. <HI>Of the Abu&s;es of the</HI> Art <HI>of</HI> Printing.</HEAD>
<P>IT would have been very wonderful, if the encouragement, which that art receiv'd from the great and learned, &s;hould not have in|duc'd at the &s;ame time &s;ome per&s;ons, who&s;e ignorance and avarice would not permit them to aim at that degree of perfection; which they &s;aw others arrive at, to engage in ba&s;e methods of enjoying the fruit of their ingenuity and diligence, without the trouble of imitating them in it. We have already given occa&s;ionally &s;ome accounts of the&s;e practices, in counterfeiting the works, names and marks of the be&s;t Printers, who have been oblig'd to remon&s;trate again&s;t them to the world. For as &s;oon as they had publi&s;h'd a curious and correct edition, with prodigious charge and labour, &s;ome of the&s;e pyrates immediately printed another after it, tho' in every re&s;pect inferior to the former; and either by un|der&s;elling, defrauded them of the reward of their care and expence, or by counterfeiting their names and marks, de&s;troy'd their reputation.
<PB N="286" REF="297">
By the&s;e abu&s;es, they were oblig'd to make many fruitle&s;s attempts in order to &s;uppre&s;s the&s;e counterfeits, and at la&s;t to have recour&s;e to the higher powers for priviledges and patents, the only effectual way to pre|vent &s;uch practices. We have likewi&s;e hinted, that &s;ome of the&s;e pe&s;ts of learning have impos'd upon the world, by &s;elling their impre&s;&s;ions as done at <HI>Venice</HI> or &s;ome other famous place, or pretending they were printed <HI>characteribus Venetianis,</HI> with <HI>Venetian</HI> characters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> tho' they were the production of &s;ome ob&s;cure place and printer, who&s;e only aim was profit.</P>
<P>ANOTHER abu&s;e con&s;equent upon this, was the counterfeiting of dates. For when, by the care of a <HI>Froben,</HI> a <HI>Badius,</HI> or &s;ome other eminent Printer, the world was &s;o far appriz'd of the&s;e counterfeits, that the au|thors of them could not vend their impre&s;&s;ions, they immediately reprint|ed the title page, perhaps with &s;ome alteration, put a new date, and &s;ome|times a new name to it, and &s;o pa&s;s'd them off for new editions. To recommend them the more to the buyers, they generally a&s;&s;erted them to be newly revis'd, diligently compared with the be&s;t MSS. corrected in above 500 places, and the like. It was with great difficulty that the&s;e abu&s;es were detected in &s;uch a manner as to make the world aware of them. The complaints of the learned, and their vain efforts to remedy &s;uch inconveniences are too well known to be mention'd here. I &s;hall pa&s;s to another equally &s;hameful and dangerous abu&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> printing of leud, infamous books, of which the learned <HI>Ger&s;on,</HI> among many others, complains with great zeal; and mentions particularly a romance, inti|tled the <HI>Romance of the Ro&s;e,</HI> compos'd in 1300, of which he &s;aid, that if he was the ma&s;ter of the la&s;t copy, he would rather choo&s;e to burn it than part with it at any price <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Si e&s;&s;et mihi Liber Romancii de Ro&s;a, qui e&s;&s;et unicus, &amp; valeret mille pecuniarum libras, comburerem potius quam venderem.</NOTE>. <HI>Pa&s;tor fido,</HI> is a poem almo&s;t univer|&s;ally known, which, we are told by <HI>J. Nicius Erith,</HI> caus'd many virgins and marry'd women to pro&s;titute their honour. Yet great numbers of a much more pernicious nature have been publi&s;h'd in tho&s;e times. I &s;hall only mention one, which I e&s;teem a ma&s;ter-piece in that kind, heighten'd by the art of engraving, that it might be a con&s;ummate piece of the mo&s;t &s;candalous lewdne&s;s in nature. <HI>George Va&s;ari,</HI> in the lives
<PB N="287" REF="298">
of the <HI>Italian</HI> painters, gives us this &s;hort account of it; that <HI>Julius Ro|manus,</HI> the mo&s;t celebrated painter of his age, invented above four&s;core de&s;igns, which he caus'd to be engraven on wood, while <HI>Peter Aretine,</HI> a great Libertine and Athei&s;t, compos'd a &s;onnet for each of the prints. This vile performance was publi&s;hed about the year 1525. I &s;hall con|lude with <HI>Va&s;ari</HI>'s character of it, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Io non &s;o qual fu&s;&s;e piu o brutto le &s;pet|tacolo de i de&s;egni di Giulo ali' occhio, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">le parole dell' Aretino a gl'erechi <HI>Vite ad Pittori,</HI> part 3 p 302.</NOTE> <HI>that he knew not which was mo&s;t bruti&s;h and &s;hocking, the de&s;ign of</HI> Julius <HI>to the eye, or the ver&s;es of</HI> Aretine <HI>to the ear.</HI> This &s;ame avarice which prompted Printers to undertake &s;uch infamous works, as the foregoing, induc'd them to abu&s;e thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> art in another re&s;pect, <HI>viz.</HI> in printing &s;candalous and defamatory libels' to the &s;hame of their profe&s;&s;ion, and the regret of the virtuous. As printing and the reformation begun about the &s;ame time, the former was pro&s;tituted by the meaner &s;ort, who printed the vile&s;t forgeries on each, tho' that which was uppermo&s;t, acted mo&s;t flagrantly, when the other was oblig'd to work covertly. But as this and the la&s;t do not &s;o properly fall within my province as a Printer, I &s;hall content my&s;elf with having ju&s;t mention'd them, with abhorrence of &s;uch practices, and return to &s;ome other abu&s;es.</P>
<P>THE next aro&s;e from want of good correctors; for per&s;ons of that cla&s;s were thought too chargeable by many Printers; who therefore made u&s;e of illiterate fellows, whom they could hire much cheaper; or, which often happen'd, us'd none at all. It will ea&s;ily be imagin'd, what a number of wretched editions the world mu&s;t have been pe&s;ter'd with by this &s;ordid neglect. However, as books were not yet &s;o plentifully pro|pagated, as to &s;uffice the number of &s;tudents, there wanted not per&s;ons either dull or poor enough to purcha&s;e them, e&s;pecially upon a &s;mall abatement of the common price. This made &s;ome Printers de&s;ignedly &s;uppre&s;s the errata, which would have inevitably endanger'd the &s;ale of &s;uch books; tho' others were oblig'd by the authors or editors to print them at the end of their works. The reader will no doubt be &s;urpriz'd to hear of &s;ome of them &s;o prodigiou&s;ly large, as to be &s;carce credible. We have a remarkable in&s;tance in the works of <HI>John Francis Picus de Mi|randula,</HI> printed at <HI>Strasburgh</HI> for the fir&s;t time in 1507, by <HI>John Krob|louch,</HI>

We have in the la&s;t chapter given an ac|count of <HI>Rob. Stephens,</HI> who was certainly an excellent Printer; and yet, however it happen'd, M. <HI>Le Clerc</HI> tells us, <HI>Bibl.

<P><HI>John Chapius</HI> tells us of a change and tran&s;po&s;ition of words, which render'd the &s;en&s;e wholly unintelligible, in his <HI>Sext. Decret.</HI> printed at <HI>Paris</HI> in 1510; where under the title <HI>De dolo et contumacia,</HI> he found the&s;e words; <HI>Et nuntio ella cum creditur ex de appiurato parati;</HI> in&s;tead of, <HI>Et nuncio jurato creditur ex De Apella cum parati. Henry Stephens,</HI> in his preface to his <HI>Querimonia</HI> ju&s;t mentioned, tells us of an ignorant corrector whom he knew, who, wherever he met with the word <HI>procos,</HI> us'd to correct it <HI>porcos,</HI> and change the word <HI>exanimare,</HI> into <HI>exami|nare.</HI> He mentions others, who alter'd a word they under&s;tood not, for one more common and known; thus in the &s;econd epi&s;tle of the fir&s;t book, <HI>Horace</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Nunc adbibe puero pectore verba, puer;</HI> but the word <HI>adbibe</HI> not being under&s;tood by them, they &s;ub&s;tituted that of <HI>adbibe,</HI> which was more obvious to them; yet even this ab&s;urd cor|rection, is &s;till retain'd in &s;ome more modern editions. To this, I be|lieve, we owe another correction in the &s;ame poet, where they have chang'd <HI>&s;ectis unguibus,</HI> into <HI>&s;trictis unguibus;</HI> whereas, <HI>Horace</HI> only meant the kind fair ones par'd their nails clo&s;e, when they encounter'd with the youths, lea&s;t the &s;cratches which decency and formality ob|lig'd them to give them when they play'd too rudely, &s;hould enter deep enough to hurt them. <HI>Chevilier</HI> &s;peaks of a book printed by <HI>Guido Mercator</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> in 1493, in which there is a flagrant error in the very fronti&s;piece, for the title is <HI>Elegantiarum viginta praecepta.</HI> It may be objected, that this was an over&s;ight; but the contrary is plain, &s;ince it is printed &s;o in the next leaf, and at the end of the book, <HI>Expliciunt elegantiarum viginta praecepta Pari&s;iis per Guidonem,</HI> &amp;c. &s;o that it evidently aro&s;e from their ignorance of the <HI>Latin</HI> tongue. Nor is this to be wonder'd at, when <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> tells us, in his preface to the 4th edition of his <HI>Adages</HI> in 1525, that &s;ome of the Printers of <HI>Rome,</HI>
<PB N="291" REF="302">
<HI>Venice</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> &s;carce knew how to read. This &s;ame author likewi&s;e wrote 10 or 11 years before this to his friend <HI>Schurrer,</HI> a Printer of <HI>Strasburgh. John de Savigny</HI> had been &s;o ill us'd by the&s;e drunken and ignorant Printers, as he &s;tyles them, in a work of the learned bi&s;hop of <HI>Gaieta,</HI> which he publi&s;h'd in 1520, that he took the mo&s;t effectual way to make them trumpeters of their own igno|rance, by couching his reproaches in &s;uch terms in <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> as were not under&s;tood by either Printer or correctors. His words are the&s;e: <HI>In i&s;tos haud ab&s;temios</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>a Clitorio fonte longe remoti&s;&s;imos cudatur faba.</HI> Let the blame be laid upon tho&s;e drunken and illiterate Printers, who are equally remote from learning and politene&s;s. We &s;hall conclude this &s;ubject with one in&s;tance more. After the bi&s;hop of <HI>Aleria</HI> had publi&s;h'd his edition of <HI>Pliny</HI>'s natural hi&s;tory, in the dedication of which he tells the pope, <HI>that he had &s;pent nine whole years in correcting it, tho' he believ'd nine more would &s;carce &s;uffice to make a perfect edition, Hermolaus Barbarus</HI> corrected almo&s;t five thou&s;and faults in it. Several other learned men engag'd in the &s;ame province, and in particular <HI>John Cae&s;areus</HI> corrected about four thou&s;and faults in his edition printed at <HI>Cologn,</HI> by <HI>Eucharius Cervicornus,</HI> a famous Printer of that city, in 1524, as he acquaints us in the preface. But the compo&s;er and corrector &s;uffer'd a prodigious blunder to go uncor|rected in the fronti&s;piece of that book, wherein the reader is told, that this new edition is corrected in no le&s;s than four hundred thou&s;and places <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">&mdash;opus hoc locis non pauciori|bus quam quadringentis millibus emacula|tius atque olim, nunc demum in lucem pro|dire.</NOTE>. 'Tis &s;urpri&s;ing, that a book &s;hould be corrected in &s;o many places &s;ince the la&s;t edition of it; but when the reader comes to the preface, he finds but four thou&s;and, and the Printer put <HI>quadringentis millibus,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>quatuor millibus.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN it was found, that neither the remon&s;trances of the learned, nor their &s;arca&s;ms continually printed again&s;t &s;uch Printers, could pre|vail upon them to be more diligent, and procure better correctors; &s;e|veral countries took methods of putting a &s;top to this growing evil. <HI>Spain</HI> was, I think, the fir&s;t which &s;hew'd the example, by a way to
<PB N="292" REF="303">
make the compo&s;er and corrector more careful in their re&s;pective pro|vinces. It was order'd, that before a book could be &s;old, it &s;hould be examin'd by cen&s;ors appointed for that purpo&s;e, and compar'd with the manu&s;cript; and that all the faults of the impre&s;&s;ion &s;hould be &s;et down in the fir&s;t lea&s;t; after which they were to write underneath, that the book, the faults of the impre&s;&s;ion above noted excepted, was faithful|ly printed. This certificate had generally the following title in <HI>Spani&s;h. E&s;ta e&s;te libro bien impre&s;&s;o y correcto conforme a &s;u original de mano. En Madrid,</HI> &amp;c. &s;ign'd N. N. It was &s;ometimes printed in <HI>Latin.</HI> Where they could not obtain &s;uch an order, they follow'd the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> method as far as they could. Thus <HI>Jo. Ravi&s;ius Textor,</HI> profe&s;&s;or of rhetorick at <HI>Paris,</HI> made a kind of affidavit, that he had corrected all the errata of the dialogue of <HI>Henry Hutten,</HI> intitled <HI>Aula,</HI> printed at <HI>Paris</HI> in 1519, by <HI>Antony Au&s;&s;urd,</HI> who put under the title-page. <HI>Textor ema|culavit.</HI> The &s;ame method was follow'd by <HI>Henry Stephens,</HI> who in his edition of the <HI>Pimander</HI> of <HI>Hermes Tri&s;megi&s;tus,</HI> printed in 1505, publi&s;h'd by <HI>James Fabry d'E&s;taples,</HI> has &s;et down the names of the correctors in the&s;e words; <HI>Pari&s;iis ex officin&acirc; Henrici Stephani, recog|nitoribus menda&s;que ex officin&acirc; eluentibus Jacobo &s;olido Cracovien&s;i &amp; Vol|gatio Praten&s;i, anno</HI> 1505. We could trace this method as far as the be|ginning of the 15th century; which had this good effect, that tho&s;e books, in which the correctors had put their names, were always pre|ferr'd to tho&s;e where no mention was made of any. There were after|wards better regulations obtain'd from the higher powers in every kingdom, in order to aboli&s;h the&s;e pernicious abu&s;es; but as they do not come within our epoch, we &s;hall forbear mentioning them.</P>
<P>THE reader will excu&s;e me, if I &s;o far digre&s;s from my &s;ubject, as to give an in&s;tance or two of the dangerous con&s;equences, which had like to have happen'd to two eminent writers of that age, to the one by the addition, and to the other by the &s;ub&s;traction of a &s;ingle letter. The fir&s;t is of <HI>Era&s;mus,</HI> who in his paraphra&s;e on ch. 16, v. of S. <HI>Matthew</HI> where S. <HI>Peter</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Tu es Chri&s;tus Filius Dei vivi,</HI> had writ|ten, <HI>Non &s;u&s;picione proferens, &s;ed certa &amp; indubitata &s;cientia pro&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tent, illum e&s;&s;e Me&s;&s;iam a prophetis promi&s;&s;um, &s;ingulari more Filium Dei,</HI> &amp;c. by which la&s;t words he only meant, as he afterwards explain'd it, that
<PB N="293" REF="304">
Chri&s;t was the &s;on of God after a particular manner, different from that which was common to men. But it happen'd, that in his <HI>Ba&s;il</HI> edi|tion printed by <HI>Froben,</HI> the letter <HI>a</HI> being added to <HI>more,</HI> made it have a quite di&s;&s;erent &s;en&s;e. Hereupon <HI>Noel Beda,</HI> a famous divine of <HI>Paris,</HI> and enemy to <HI>Era&s;mus,</HI> fail'd not to take him to task for that expre&s;|&s;ion, and charg'd him with having affirm'd, that Chri&s;t was only the &s;on of God by adoption, and by a particular love of God towards him <HI>(fingulari amore)</HI> and not his eternal &s;on, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Soon after which, the divines of <HI>Paris</HI> publi&s;h'd a cen&s;ure of that propo&s;ition to the fol|lowing tenour; <HI>That it gave a fal&s;e &s;en&s;e to the words of the Evangeli&s;t, and a handle to men, to think wrong of the divinity of the Son of God, as</HI> Ne&s;torius <HI>had done; for that Chri&s;t was not the Son of God</HI> by any particular love of <HI>God towards him, nor by any adoption or favour, but that he was originally and nece&s;&s;arily &s;o. Era&s;mus</HI> clear'd him&s;elf by &s;aying, that it was a fault of the impre&s;&s;ion, and appeal'd to his original and former edition of the &s;ame paraphra&s;e, in which they would find the word <HI>more,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>amore;</HI> but he was too much &s;u&s;pected by tho&s;e gentlemen, to be ea&s;ily believ'd either in this, or any other ca&s;e.</P>
<P>THE other happen'd to the learned Dr. <HI>Flavigny,</HI> author of &s;ome letters again&s;t Mr. <HI>Jay</HI>'s polyglot, in which two learned <HI>Maronites</HI> had been employ'd by Mr. <HI>Jay,</HI> viz. <HI>Abraham Echellen&s;is,</HI> Regius profe&s;&s;or of <HI>Syriac</HI> and <HI>Arabic,</HI> who had given the text and <HI>Latin</HI> ver&s;ion of tho&s;e two languages of the book of <HI>Ruth;</HI> and <HI>Gabriel Sionita,</HI> pro|fe&s;&s;or of the &s;ame languages. The former of the&s;e had committed a great many errors in his tran&s;lation, as well as in the text of that book, neverthele&s;s he attack'd his brother <HI>Maronite,</HI> and charg'd him with &s;ome mi&s;takes in his part of the work. Hereupon Dr. <HI>Flavigny,</HI> who knew them both equally guilty, undertook to rebuke the aggre&s;&s;or; and in a letter to him <HI>(Echellen&s;is),</HI> made u&s;e of the&s;e words of our Saviour; <HI>Quid vides f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tucam in oculo fratris tui?</HI> (why beholde&s;t thou the mote in thy brother's eye?) <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It happen'd unfortunately, that the fir&s;t letter of the word <HI>oculo</HI> being either taken up by the balls, or dropt out of the &s;orm, or &s;ome other way lo&s;t, after the fir&s;t proofs had been corrected, gave a very har&s;h &s;ound to it, and made it &s;eem a profane je&s;ting upon that &s;acred book. <HI>Echellen&s;is,</HI> in his an&s;wer,
<PB N="294" REF="305">
took notice of this, and calls him a &s;acrilegious and <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> perverter of the holy text; and, without acquainting him with his faults, tells him, that &s;uch an abominable correction of the text, was too foul for his pen, and only worthy the writings of a <HI>Flavigny;</HI> in &s;hort, he &s;pends near a whole page in the mo&s;t opprobrious language again&s;t him, that the height of malice and re&s;entment could in&s;pire an inve|terate antagoni&s;t with. Dr. <HI>Flavigny</HI> was a long time before he could di&s;cover the cau&s;e of this accu&s;ation, and in all probability might have been &s;till longer ignorant of it, had not a friend of his &s;hew'd it to him in the printed copy; for in the two fir&s;t proofs the word was printed perfect. The re&s;ult was, that the author being recover'd of his &s;urprize, threw the fault upon the corrector, appeal'd to his ori|ginal, and to the two fir&s;t proofs, prote&s;ted his innocency and abhor|rence of &s;uch an action, and took a &s;olemn oath, in order to clear him&s;elf. <HI>Chevilier,</HI> who relates this &s;tory, tells us, that <HI>Flavigny,</HI> &s;ome time before his death, happen'd to mention this; and tho' it was above 30 years after this tran&s;action, he could not forbear expre&s;&s;ing the highe&s;t indignation again&s;t his Printer and corrector. The&s;e in&s;tances &s;ufficiently demon&s;trate the dangerous con&s;equences of neglect in cor|recting to the author of any book, e&s;pecially in divinity.</P>
<P>BEFORE I di&s;mi&s;s this article of the incorrectne&s;s of the pre&s;s, I cannot but mention &s;ome of the greate&s;t Printers; who, when any of their editions have happen'd to be incorrect, have made an inge|nuous confe&s;&s;ion of, and apology for it, that the commonwealth of learning might not receive any di&s;advantage by it, nor the authors &s;uffer in their reputation thro' their neglect. I &s;hall begin with <HI>Mar|tin Schurrer,</HI> of <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> allow'd by <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> to be a per&s;on of learn|ing, who printed in 1500 the treati&s;e <HI>De Patientia</HI> of <HI>Bapt. Mantua|nus.</HI> But as he had committed the care of it to a negligent and igno|rant corrector, he found him&s;elf oblig'd to add an errata of a page and half to it, which he prefaces in the humble&s;t terms imaginable <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Maluimus potius pudore, no&s;tro fatendo plecti, quam tacendo re&s;publica literarai &s;uo damno no&s;tra peccata &s;int.</NOTE>; I rather choo&s;e, &s;ays he, to take the &s;hame of them upon my&s;elf, by confe&s;&s;ing my fault, than to let the republick of learning &s;uffer by
<PB N="295" REF="306">
my concealment of it. Of this kind is the apology which the &s;ame Printer makes for the errors of impre&s;&s;ion in an edition before men|tioned, <HI>viz.</HI> the works of <HI>Picus de Mirandula;</HI> wherein he de&s;ires the reader, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Errores chalcographis, non authori ad|&s;cribito. Fatemur ingenu&egrave; culpam no&s;tram.</NOTE> that he would not attribute tho&s;e errors to the author, but to the Printer, who frankly confe&s;&s;es his fault. Such errata's not only make &s;ome kind of reparations to the authors, but oblige likewi&s;e an hone&s;t Printer to be more careful for the future. <HI>Henry Stephens</HI> hath often taken the &s;ame method, and owns, that &s;ome errors have crept unawares into &s;ome of his editions <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Locis aliquot incuria no&s;tra aberrotum e&s;t.</NOTE>. I &s;hould digre&s;s too far, if I &s;hould in&s;tance in all tho&s;e Printers, who have follow'd &s;o good an example; 'tis &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that none of tho&s;e eminent ones, of whom we have given an account in this whole book, have ever been a&s;ham'd of acknowledging the faults of their works, when they had any &s;hare in them. I &s;hall clo&s;e this with a plea&s;ant way, which the abovemention'd <HI>Stephens</HI> took to correct a fault in his edi|tion <HI>De prae&s;agiis in morbis acutis</HI> of <HI>Hippocrates, anno</HI> 1512. 'Tis ob|vious to every &s;cholar, that the fir&s;t &s;yllable in the word <HI>Febris</HI> (a fe|ver or ague) may be either long or &s;hort; but he having thro' in|advertency &s;pelt the word with oe, which made it ab&s;olutely long, he corrects him&s;elf for it, by &s;aying, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Febrem longam &s;ibi chalcographus dele|git' tamet&s;i febris correpta &s;it minus pericu|lo&s;a.</NOTE> <HI>That the Printer had fooli&s;hly cho&s;en a long fever, when a &s;hort one was much more eligible, as being le&s;s dan|gerous.</HI></P>
<P>BUT after all that hath been &s;aid concerning the ba&s;ene&s;s, negligence, and ignorance of &s;ome of the Printers of tho&s;e times, it mu&s;t be own'd, that many a negligent and ignorant author, when he has been admoni&s;h'd of his errors, hath not &s;crupled to throw them upon the Printer and corrector; which I e&s;teem another abu&s;e of the Art of Printing. I could give many in&s;tances of it, were I not apprehen&s;ive of betraying too great a fondne&s;s for our profe&s;&s;ion. However, any judicious reader will ea&s;ily perceive by the large&s;t Errata's which we have mention'd, that the authors had as great a &s;hare in them as the
<PB N="296" REF="307">
Printers and correctors. <HI>Chevilier,</HI> who cannot be &s;u&s;pected of parti|ality to the latter, has excus'd them in many ca&s;es, and &s;hewn that the fault was rather to be imputed to the former. But he has furni&s;h'd me with an in&s;tance of this, which, I believe, he little thought of; in the ca&s;e of a learned divine of the univer&s;ity of <HI>Paris,</HI> who&s;e works having been cen&s;ur'd by that body, and he refu&s;ing to retract them, he was expell'd that univer&s;ity, but was afterwards prevail'd upon to recant. After his death a paper was publi&s;h'd in his name, in which the blame was laid upon the prote&s;tant Printers, to whom he had intru&s;ted the work. I &s;hall relate the &s;tory exactly after Chevilier, tho' &s;omewhat abridg'd, and leave the reader to judge, whether the wrong per&s;ons were not un|ju&s;tly blam'd. I hope the &s;ingularity of the fact will &s;ufficiently excu&s;e me, tho' it is of later date, than our prefix'd period.</P>
<P><HI>Ren&eacute; Benoi&s;t,</HI> D. D. curate of S. <HI>Eu&s;tace</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> made a <HI>French</HI> ver|&s;ion of the bible, which he caus'd to be printed in fol. ann. 1566 by three eminent book&s;ellers of that city. This book immediately met with ma|ny oppo&s;ers, who cen&s;ur'd it as heretical and erroneous, alledging, that it was only the <HI>Geneva</HI> tran&s;lation; in which the author had &s;often'd tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions which were mo&s;t &s;hocking to the Roman Catholicks. The divines of that univer&s;ity, having met &s;everal times, agreed to cen&s;ure the book, which they did accordingly, <HI>July</HI> 15, 1567. The &s;ame cen|&s;ure was renew'd, and &s;ub&s;crib'd to, by &s;eventy three doctors of that fa|culty, and approv'd <HI>viva voce</HI> by above one hundred and twenty more about 7 years after. <HI>Gregory</HI> XII. confirm'd the cen&s;ure, and condemn'd the book, by a brief dated <HI>Nov.</HI> 3. 1475. During this, <HI>Benoi&s;t</HI> ab&s;o|lutely refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit, in &s;pite of all the endeavours of that body to per&s;uade him to it. At length they agreed upon expelling him that uni|ver&s;ity as an ob&s;tinate heretick, and the &s;entence of his pro&s;cription was written in great letters, and &s;et up in the common di&s;putation-hall of the univer&s;ity, by which he was, as it were, executed <HI>in e&s;&s;igie.</HI> However, <HI>Henry</HI> IV. took him into favour, made him his confe&s;&s;or, and pro|moted him to a bi&s;hoprick; but the Pope refus'd to grant him his bull. At la&s;t, his &s;eniority entitling him to be cho&s;en dean of the fa|culty, they all refus'd their votes, unle&s;s he would &s;ubmit to their for|mer cen&s;ures, which he was at length oblig'd to do by a recantation,
<PB N="297" REF="308">
in which he condemns his ver&s;ion, and rejects &s;ome parts of it as be|ing fal&s;ly attributed to him. This was not done till the year 1598, <HI>i. e.</HI> 32 years after the publication of it.</P>
<P>IN 1608, a little before <HI>Benoi&s;t</HI>'s death, came out a book in 8vo, intitled, <HI>A declaration of</HI> Ren&eacute; Benoi&s;t, <HI>concerning his tran&s;lation of the bible and annotations thereupon;</HI> in which he declares,</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That the ground of all his &s;orrow was the treachery of the cor|rector, compo&s;er and pre&s;s-man, who had been intru&s;ted with the impre&s;&s;ion of his bible; that the copy which he had given them was a printed one <HI>(here</HI> Chevilier <HI>notes, that it was a</HI> Geneva <HI>one,)</HI> upon which he had made his corrections and era&s;ements, which were not &s;o fully eras'd, but that they might be ea&s;ily read:<P>THAT &s;ome of the journeymen <HI>(they did not dare publickly to at|tack their ma&s;ters, who would in all probability have clear'd them&s;elves)</HI> were of the <HI>Geneva</HI> leaven, and printed nothing in the fir&s;t and &s;e|cond proofs but what was in his copy; but when they came to the third, which he did not &s;ee, they &s;ub&s;tituted, in&s;tead of his corrections, the words or notes, which he had eras'd <HI>(&s;ome in&s;tances of which the author of the book gives),</HI> and which the compo&s;er and pre&s;s-man in confederacy had maliciou&s;ly fal&s;ify'd:</P>
<P>That it were tedious to enumerate all &s;uch pieces of treachery; but that the re&s;ult of it turn'd to his reputation, notwith&s;tanding his un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts to bring tho&s;e journeymen to puni&s;hment:</P>
<P>That his books had been &s;old under his name, tho' he had di&s;own'd them:</P>
<P>That the cen&s;ure of the univer&s;ity, and the confirmation of it by the court of <HI>Rome,</HI> which had condemn'd the work, and not the au|thor, was the con&s;equence of this impo&s;ture, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>'</P></Q></P>
<P>I SHALL not enter into a detail of the reflections which <HI>Chevilier</HI> makes upon the <HI>Calvini&s;t</HI> Printers, as he calls them, nor enquire whe|ther this declamation was really penn'd by <HI>Benoi&s;t,</HI> or father'd upon him; or if the former, whether it might not be extorted from him, a practice not unu&s;ual with the divines of that church. I &s;hall only ob|&s;erve, that, were the ca&s;e as it is related in that pamphlet, 'tis &s;carce credible, that the doctor could have been 30 years unappris'd of it,
<PB N="298" REF="309">
e&s;pecially when the cen&s;ures and libels, continually publi&s;h'd again&s;t him, &s;ufficiently pointed it out to him; and if he knew it, can it be imagin'd that he would have continued &s;o long under all that &s;candal, and the per&s;ecution of his enemies, when he might have ea&s;ily clear'd him&s;elf of the one, and &s;o put a &s;top effectually to the other? Upon the whole, whoever the author of this declaration is, this &s;tory evi|dently confutes it&s;elf, and is no other than one of their pious frauds, on which 'tis not my province to animadvert, any further than the credit of our profe&s;&s;ion is concern'd.</P>
<P>BEFORE I clo&s;e this chapter, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to remind the reader, that this &s;econd book being wholly confin'd to the hi&s;tory of printing in other parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> (what relates to our nation being the &s;ubject of the next book,) I have given none but foreign in&s;tances of the corruptions and abu&s;es introduced into this art.</P>
<P>'TIS not therefore to be concluded, that it hath been free in any ca&s;e from them in <HI>England;</HI> &s;ince we have imitated our neighbours in the&s;e bad, as well as in their other good, examples; and therefore as the&s;e abu&s;es have been equally common to us and them, I &s;hall not repeat them in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> part, but only reque&s;t the reader, once for all, to remember, that we have had our &s;hare as well in the di&s;advan|tages, under which our art has labour'd, as in the advantages and im|provements, which it has receiv'd.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX. <HI>An Account of a newly di&s;cover'd Edition, printed by</HI> John Guttenberg <HI>at</HI> Stratzburg <HI>in</HI> 1458, <HI>com|municated to me by, and now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, the Right Honourable the Earl of</HI> Pembroke.</HEAD>
<P>THE reader may be plea&s;ed to recollect that I have, throughout the fir&s;t book of this hi&s;tory, con&s;tantly endeavour'd to fix the glory of the invention of Printing upon <HI>John Fau&s;t,</HI> and that of the improvements of it upon his worthy &s;on-in-law <HI>Peter Scheoffer,</HI> exclu&s;ive of <HI>John Guttenberg,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the te&s;timony of &s;ome few writers who have a&s;cribed the fir&s;t di&s;coveries to the latter. I did likewi&s;e offer it as a probable conjecture of the ingenious Mr. <HI>Maittair,</HI> that <HI>Gutten|berg,</HI> having been ca&s;t in a law-&s;uit at <HI>Mentz</HI> for non-&s;olvency of his quota, might retire to <HI>Stratzburgh,</HI> and there teach <HI>John Mentel,</HI> what he had been able to learn of <HI>Fau&s;t</HI>'s art. We had not till then the lea&s;t ground to conjecture that he ever practi&s;ed it him&s;elf, no annali&s;t that ever I could meet with ever mentioning, or perhaps dreaming of, any edition printed with his name. But &s;ince then the noble lord above-mention'd, unwilling to re&s;t &s;atisfy'd with conjectures, has &s;pared no pains or co&s;t to inform him&s;elf whether there was any impre&s;&s;ion extant done by <HI>Guttenberg,</HI> and has at length procured this curious one, which his lord&s;hip has been plea&s;ed to communicate to me. The reader, I doubt not, will be highly &s;atisfy'd to find that, in&s;tead of contradicting any thing I have advanc'd upon that &s;ubject, it rather confirms it all beyond any po&s;&s;ibility of doubting.</P>
<P>THE book is the dialogues of St. <HI>Gregory</HI> in <HI>Latin,</HI> it has no title|page, but begins abruptly with the &s;ubject it&s;elf, only at the end of it are the&s;e words;</P>

<P>I SHALL now beg leave to make a few remarks on this curious piece, and to &s;hew how manife&s;tly it confirms all my former conjectures.</P>
<P N="1">1. IT is very rude, and comes va&s;tly &s;hort of tho&s;e of <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> and <HI>Scheoffer;</HI> and the great and almo&s;t con&s;tant difference of the &s;hapes of the &s;ame letters, &s;hews it to have been done upon wooden blocks, after the manner of the <HI>paginae conglutinatae</HI> mention'd above, <HI>pag.</HI> 49 <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI> there is, however, this difference and improvement in it, that it is not printed with the &s;ame (that is with the) common Ink, which made them incapable of a reiteration, <HI>i. e.</HI> of being printed but upon one &s;ide, but with the new invented &s;ort, which was a mixture of oil-var|ni&s;h and lamp-black, and will bear printing on both &s;ides. This, there|fore, &s;hews that he had only got an in&s;ight into the fir&s;t di&s;covery, but was an utter &s;tranger to the la&s;t and more u&s;eful one of &s;eparate metal|types, which <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> had probably kept conceal'd from him.</P>
<P N="2">2. SUPPOSING it to be the fir&s;t piece that ever he did, as it pro|bably was, if not the only one of that kind, it was printed in 1458, <HI>i. e.</HI> about three years after the law-&s;uit and his falling out with <HI>Fau&s;t;</HI> &s;o that it took him up all that time in cutting his blocks, and getting the re&s;t of the apparatus of a Printing-pre&s;s, making of tryals, macu|latures, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> after he was &s;ettled at <HI>Stratzburgh.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. IT is printed one year after the p&s;alter of <HI>Mentz,</HI> which was done in &s;eparate metal-types, and wherein <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> and <HI>Scheoffer</HI> a&s;&s;ume to them|&s;elves the whole glory of the invention; &s;o that had <HI>Guttenberg</HI> had the lea&s;t preten&s;ion to it, he would not have fail'd doing him&s;elf ju&s;tice by altering the &s;tyle of his colophon, and telling the world what &s;hare he had borne in this noble di&s;covery, that his &s;ilence was not owing to his hone&s;ty is plain from his refu&s;ing to pay his dividend of the charges, much le&s;s to his being ignorant of the publication of <HI>Fau&s;t</HI>'s p&s;alter, be|cau&s;e <HI>Mentz</HI> and <HI>Stratzburgh</HI> being both &s;ituate upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and not above 60 leagues a&s;under, it was morally impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould not have
<PB N="301" REF="312">
heard of it. On the contrary, it is likely that, having &s;een it, and ob|&s;erv'd it to be printed with fu&s;ile types, he might ju&s;t fini&s;h this rude edition of his, and then &s;top his hand until <HI>Mentel</HI> and he had fallen upon the &s;ame way of ca&s;ting them.</P>
<P N="4">4. THIS piece is printed upon the &s;ame paper that <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> did u&s;e, which is mark'd with the heifer's head and horns, and might either be his &s;hare of the paper-&s;tock which they divided at parting, and which he took away with him, or el&s;e might be de&s;ignedly imitated by him, to give a credit to his work. Upon the whole, its having neither title|page, running title, &s;ignature, nor direction-word, and being altogether a rude piece of workman&s;hip, doth plainly &s;hew it to have been of the nature of the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays of <HI>Fau&s;t,</HI> and that it is by no means ante|dated.</P>

<P>I HAVE only mention'd &s;ome of the mo&s;t famous for their learning and diligence, be&s;ides whom there were many more, who, tho' of an infe|rior cla&s;s, in compari&s;on of the former; yet were all men of letters, and va&s;tly &s;uperior to tho&s;e, which Printers have been forced to make u&s;e of in proce&s;s of time. It mu&s;t be al&s;o remember'd, that many of tho&s;e Printers of the 15th, and part of the 16th century, were men of great learning and parts, and indefatigable indu&s;try, able to prepare their manu&s;cripts for the pre&s;s, and to correct their own works: Such were the great <HI>Amerback</HI> at <HI>Ba&s;il,</HI> who was ma&s;ter of arts in the univer&s;ity of <HI>Paris, Froben</HI> his worthy partner and &s;ucce&s;&s;or, <HI>Ant. Coburger</HI> at <HI>Nurem|bergh, Aldus Manucius</HI> and <HI>Azulanus</HI> at <HI>Venice, Jodocus Badius</HI> at <HI>Lyons</HI> and <HI>Paris,</HI> and many more, of whom we have given an account in this hi&s;tory. And yet it is ob&s;ervable from this table, that tho&s;e, who were the mo&s;t capable of correcting their own works, did &s;till entertain the greate&s;t number of correctors.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, I mu&s;t not omit acquainting the readers, that tho&s;e great per&s;ons whom we have mention'd in this li&s;t, were not properly correctors in the &s;en&s;e we now under&s;tand that word; that is, men re|tain'd
<PB N="309" REF="320">
by a proper &s;alary to perform that function, but editors or au|thors, and correctors only of their own works; or if at any time they were prevail'd upon to over&s;ee any curious edition, it was done rather out of curio&s;ity than for gain. For 'tis certain that every Printer had be&s;ides a corrector of an inferior rank to revi&s;e and correct every proof, if he did not do it him&s;elf, before they were &s;ent to tho&s;e great men, who&s;e corrections were generally of a higher nature. What makes me mention this di&s;tinction, is the grief which the famous <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> conceiv'd at his being upbraided by count <HI>Carpi,</HI> and more particularly by <HI>Jul. Staliger,</HI> with having &s;erv'd as corrector in <HI>Aldus</HI>'s Printing-hou&s;e, and the pains he took to clear him&s;elf from that imputation. Every body knows that <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> had ventur'd to print a dialogue, entitled <HI>Ciceronia|nus,</HI> in which he endeavour'd to &s;hew that <HI>Cicero</HI> was more cry'd up than he de&s;erv'd; at which <HI>Scaliger</HI> was &s;o enraged, that he wrote a vin|dication of that great ma&s;ter of eloquence in two different orations, which he &s;oon after printed. In the la&s;t of which he addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> in words to this effect; <HI>Did not you get a livelihood by cor|recting</HI> Aldus<HI>'s proofs? and were not tho&s;e errata we meet with in them more owing to your drunken carele&s;&s;ne&s;s than to the Printer? do they not &s;mell &s;tronger of your drunken cups than of the compo&s;er's dulne&s;s?</HI> He af|terwards affirm'd that he met with <HI>Aldus</HI> one day at <HI>Mantua,</HI> who told him that <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> was wont to di&s;patch as much bu&s;ine&s;s in one day as other correctors did in two, and to &s;olace him&s;elf the re&s;t of the time with drinking of good <HI>Malm&s;y</HI> wine. <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> was &s;o gall'd at this ora|tion, that, as <HI>Merula</HI> tells us, he bought and burnt all the copies he could po&s;&s;ibly get of it, and that he &s;ucceeded &s;o well that there was not one to be met with. However, in his an&s;wer to count <HI>Carpi,</HI> he &s;ays that he was &s;o far from correcting for <HI>Aldus,</HI> unle&s;s it were his own works, that he refu&s;ed that office to &s;ome eminent cardinals who de&s;ired him to revi&s;e the laft proofs of &s;ome works then printing: that if he took any thing el&s;e in hand, whil&s;t he &s;taid at <HI>Venice,</HI> it was not for lucre, but out of curio&s;ity; and acquaints us, that <HI>Aldus</HI> had a con&s;tant corrector to his pre&s;s named <HI>Seraphim,</HI> and then adds, <HI>Can he be call'd a &s;ervant who revi&s;es only his own works? for I never did any thing el&s;e for</HI> Aldus, <HI>who&s;e Printing-hou&s;e I u&s;ed only for my conveniency.</HI> He has likewi&s;e been
<PB N="310" REF="321">
&s;uppo&s;ed to have corrected for <HI>Theodore Martin</HI> at <HI>Louvain,</HI> but it is likely that it was in the &s;ame manner, and on the &s;ame foot as he did it at <HI>Venice.</HI> I had not dwelt &s;o long on this nice di&s;tinction, were it not that tho&s;e annali&s;ts, who have mention'd the&s;e great and learned men as correctors, have not &s;ufficiently taken notice of it. Be&s;ides, it ought to be con&s;ider'd that there is a va&s;t difference between Printing and correcting the works of antient authors after a number of manu&s;cripts, which have been mutilated and &s;poil'd by every hand through which they pa&s;s'd; and Printing the works of a modern author after his own manu&s;cript-copy, who is at hand either to revi&s;e it, or to be con&s;ult|ed upon any difficulty. The former province requires per&s;ons of the greate&s;t learning, abilities, and mo&s;t indefatigable application, in reading and comparing their manu&s;cripts, in order to di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween the genuine meaning of an author and the blunders of his tran|&s;cribers; whereas the latter may be &s;upply'd by a per&s;on of moderate parts and indu&s;try. As therefore, they have been the greate&s;t promo|ters of learning, I hope the reader will not blame me, if I have en|deavour'd to do them all po&s;&s;ible ju&s;tice, and to di&s;tingui&s;h them from tho&s;e lazy and ignorant ones who have been, and are &s;till, ju&s;tly reckon'd the common pe&s;ts of it.</P>

<P><HI>SOON after Mr.</HI> Palmer<HI>'s death, I was de&s;ired to &s;ee what was &s;till wanting to compleat his</HI> Hi&s;tory of Printing, <HI>according to his fir&s;t pro|po&s;al, and what materials he had left behind. I found, upon enquiry, that five &s;heets of this last Number were already printed off; but that the third &s;heet in cour&s;e,</HI> viz. Q q, <HI>was left unfini&s;h'd, being partly compos'd, and partly in manu&s;cript, most likely in expectation of that curious edition which</HI>
<PB N="311" REF="322">
<HI>the R. H. the Earl of</HI> Pembroke <HI>was then in &s;earch after, which has been mention'd in the Appendix to this &s;econd Book; and this &s;eems to have been the cau&s;e of his delaying this la&s;t Number &s;o long, that his la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s pre|vented his publi&s;hing it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The reader will, no doubt, be as much &s;urpri&s;ed as I was my&s;elf, at finding the last page of the &s;econd book and the fir&s;t of the third book &s;o diffe|rently numbred; and that there is a retrogre&s;&s;ion from 312 to 121: but, as the &s;ignatures of each &s;heet do follow in their regular cour&s;e, I am fully per&s;uaded that it mu&s;t have been an over&s;ight either of the compo&s;itor or of the author, which we hope the reader will ea&s;ily forgive, e&s;pecially con&s;ider|ing that there is not any thing wanting to compleat this &s;econd book; and that the materials he left behind do even exceed his computation for filling this &s;u&s;pended &s;heet. However, as there were but three &s;heets thus mi&s;-num|ber'd, having been printed off long before the author's death, I have ven|tured to &s;et all the remaining ones in their due order, to avoid the confu&s;ion that would otherwi&s;e unavoidably happen in the Index; and hope the reader will be kind enough to do the &s;ame with his pen to the&s;e three following &s;heets. Tho&s;e, who know what a tedious &s;ickne&s;s Mr.</HI> Palmer <HI>did labour un|der during the la&s;t two years of his life, will pa&s;s by &s;o incon&s;iderable an over&s;ight, in con&s;ideration of what he has done when he enjoy'd a better &s;tate of health. As for the rest of this Hi&s;tory, we hope to find the materials in &s;o good an order, that there will be little to do but to print after his manu|&s;cript, excepting where the noble Lord above-mention'd, or &s;ome of his learn|ed corre&s;pondents, have communicated &s;ome new di&s;coveries too curious to be pa&s;&s;ed by. And this furni&s;hes me with an opportunity of adding a new au|thority to what has been before advanc'd, concerning the fir&s;t invention of Printing by</HI> John Fau&s;t <HI>at</HI> Mentz, <HI>omitted by Mr.</HI> Palmer, <HI>and &s;ince com|municated to me by an ingenious friend of his. It is a paragraph extracted out of</HI> Fox<HI>'s book of martyrs, printed in 1537, page 837, wherein that learned author gives an account of the first di&s;covery of that art, in all the main particulars exactly agreeable to what has been advanc'd in the fir&s;t part of this Hi&s;tory, and is to this purpo&s;e; That about the year 1440, or, as others affirm, 1446 and 1450, one</HI> John Fau&s;t <HI>of</HI> Stratzburg, <HI>and &s;ince a citizen of</HI> Mentz, <HI>found out the way of Printing by engraving upon metals, and by degrees improv'd it to cutting of &s;ingle words, and at length</HI>
<PB N="312" REF="323">
<HI>&s;ingle letters: that, after &s;ome e&s;&s;ays, he communicated his di&s;covery to</HI> John Guttenberg <HI>and</HI> Peter Scheoffer; <HI>and the&s;e three, being fir&s;t &s;worn to in|violable &s;ecrecy, made &s;ome con&s;iderable improvements in it: that</HI> Gutten|berg <HI>did at length, with</HI> John Mentel, <HI>publi&s;h the art at</HI> Stratzburg, <HI>which was &s;oon after brought to greater perfection by &s;ome eminent Printers in other places; and in particular by</HI> Ulrick Han, <HI>or</HI> Gallus, <HI>at</HI> Rome, &amp;c. <HI>From this &s;hort account it is plain that our</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>author had his intelligence from much better hands than many of the writers that have been quoted on that &s;ubject; and it is no &s;mall pity that he, who has &s;o exactly informed him&s;elf with what had been done at</HI> Mentz, <HI>had not given us al&s;o an account of the introduction and progre&s;s of the art here in</HI> England, <HI>we might then have found a much more &s;atisfactory account of it, than the reader will find in the next book from all that Mr.</HI> Palmer <HI>could po&s;&s;ibly procure from other authors and records. However, as to this te&s;timony, I doubt not but he would have been glad to have given it an honourable place in his first book, had he been appri&s;ed of it; but it is not much to be won|der'd at, that a book of martyrs &s;hould be one of the last pieces of hi&s;tory wherein one would have look'd for it. What Dr.</HI> Fox <HI>&s;ays of their cutting or engraving upon metal, and not upon wood, as Mr.</HI> Palmer <HI>and others have &s;ince more truly affirmed, can be only look'd upon as a pardonable mi&s;take in the former, who could not be expected to be a judge of things of this nature; whereas, what the latter advances may be &s;urely rely'd on, not only becau&s;e it was in his own province, and that he neither wanted opportunities, nor &s;pared any pains to inform him&s;elf aright in all tho&s;e curious particulars, but al&s;o becau&s;e his mode&s;ty would not &s;uffer him to rely upon his own judgment, till he had it confirm'd by other eminent ma&s;ters in the art of Printing, letter-cutting,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P>_ALL our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> hi&s;torians and chroniclers, who have touch'd on this &s;ubject before <HI>Richard Atkins,</HI> viz. <HI>Stowe, Baker, Howel,</HI> &amp;c. have proceeded only upon conjecture or com|mon and fallacious reports; or perhaps the fir&s;t of the&s;e forementioned authors led the re&s;t into the&s;e mi&s;takes, that printing was not invented till the year 1459, nor brought into <HI>England</HI> till <HI>anno</HI>
<PB N="122" REF="325">
1471; that at the <HI>Abbey</HI> of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> the fir&s;t pre&s;&s;es were &s;et up; that Dr <HI>I&s;lip, Abbot</HI> of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> fir&s;t introduc'd the art into <HI>England;</HI> and that <HI>England</HI> had it at lea&s;t 10 years before any other city of <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> except <HI>Mentz</HI> and <HI>Harlem.</HI> The fal&s;ity of &s;everal of the&s;e particu|lars, &s;ufficiently appears from the fir&s;t book of this hi&s;tory; and the others are manife&s;tly di&s;prov'd &s;ince I have &s;een a book in the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI>'s library, printed at the univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford, anno</HI> 1468. How|ever, their mi&s;takes were unavoidable in tho&s;e times; becau&s;e they were ignorant of &s;everal material particulars, and of the fir&s;t editions, which were ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to determine the true periods of the invention and introduction of the art into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>BUT in 1664, <HI>Richard Atkins,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> publi&s;h'd an account of the foremention'd edition and an old manu&s;cript chronicle, pre&s;erv'd at <HI>Lambeth</HI> in the archbi&s;hop's palace, in his <HI>Original and Growth of</HI> Printing, printed by order of the right honourable Mr. <HI>Morrice</HI> &s;ecretary of &s;tate. The de&s;ign of this book, which is little more than an invective again&s;t the <HI>Company of Stationers,</HI> is to prove that printing is a branch of the <HI>royal Prerogative,</HI> and a <HI>flower</HI> of the <HI>Engli&s;h Crown.</HI> This chronicle however, of which a friend of his, whom he does not name, &s;ent him a copy, is far from being of undoubted authority, &s;ince it is liable to the&s;e exceptions. 1. That neither <HI>Atkins</HI> nor his namele&s;s friend pretend to have &s;een the original, much le&s;s to have compar'd the copy with it. 2. They give no account when and by whom this chronicle was written, and how it was bequeath'd to the <HI>Lambeth</HI> library. 3. No author, that I know of, be&s;ides <HI>Atkins,</HI> mentions this chronicle in <HI>Lambeth</HI> library, except tho&s;e who quote it from him; tho' that author hop'd that his book would oc|ca&s;ion the di&s;covery and publication of it in time for publick &s;atisfac|tion, p. 4. 4. It is not to be found there now; for the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> a&s;&s;ur'd me, that he employ'd a per&s;on for &s;ome time to &s;earch for it, but in vain. 5. It gives an account of &s;ome particulars, altogether in|con&s;i&s;tent with the more authentic accounts, which we are now ma&s;ters of, with re&s;pect to the circum&s;tances of the fir&s;t di&s;covery of the art; &s;o that we may &s;uppo&s;e, that whoever the author was, he has taken &s;ome part of his account from common report, and from the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who have laid claim to this invention. I might add, that <HI>Atkins</HI> has &s;o in|ter&s;pers'd
<PB N="123" REF="326">
the chroniclers account with his own ob&s;ervations, that it is very difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h them exactly. However, imperfect and precarious as it is, &s;ince it gives us the mo&s;t probable and clear account of this important affair, I &s;hall here &s;et it down, as I find it in the au|thor abovemention'd; after which I &s;hall endeavour, by reconciling &s;ome incon&s;i&s;tencies in it, explaining &s;everal particulars, and adding &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary remarks upon the whole, to lead the reader, if not to a certain, at lea&s;t to the mo&s;t probable account of this matter.</P>
<P>The chronicle is as follows.</P>
<P>Thomas Bourcher <HI>archbi&s;hop of</HI> Canterbury, <HI>mov'd the then King</HI> [Hen|ry 6th.] <HI>to u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible means for procuring a mold (for &s;o'twas then call'd) to be brought into this kingdom; the king (a good man, and much given to works of this nature) readily hearken'd to the motion; and taking private ad|vice, how to effect this de&s;ign, concluded it could not be brought about with|out great &s;ecrecy, and a con&s;iderable &s;um of money given to &s;uch per&s;on or per|&s;ons, as would draw off &s;ome of the workmen from</HI> Harlem <HI>in</HI> Holland, <HI>where</HI> John Guthenberg <HI>had newly invented it, and was him&s;elf per&s;onally at work. 'Twas re&s;olv'd that le&s;s than one thou&s;and marks would not produce the de|&s;ir'd effect; towards which &s;um, the archbi&s;hop pre&s;ented the king with three hundred marks. The money being now prepar'd, the management of the de|&s;ign was committed to</HI> Mr. Robert Turnour, <HI>who then was of the robes to the king, and a per&s;on mo&s;t in favour with him, of any of his condition. Mr.</HI> Turnour <HI>took to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance Mr.</HI> Caxton, <HI>a citizen of good abilities, who trading much into</HI> Holland, <HI>might be a creditable pretence, as well for his going, as &s;tay in the</HI> Low Countries. <HI>Mr.</HI> Turnour <HI>was in di&s;gui&s;e (his beard and hair quite &s;haven off;) but Mr.</HI> Caxton <HI>appear'd known and publick. They having receiv'd the &s;aid &s;um of one thou&s;and marks, went fir&s;t to</HI> Am&s;terdam, <HI>then to</HI> Leyden, <HI>not daring to enter</HI> Harlem <HI>it&s;elf; for the town was very jealous, having impri&s;on'd and apprehended divers per&s;ons, who came from other parts for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. They &s;tay'd till they had &s;pent the whole one thou&s;and marks in gifts and expences; &s;o as the king was fain to &s;end five hundred marks more; Mr.</HI> Turnour <HI>having written to the king, that he had almo&s;t done his work; a bargain (as he &s;aid) being &s;truck between him and two</HI> Hollanders, <HI>for bringing off one of the workmen, who &s;hould &s;ufficiently di&s;cover and teach this new art: At la&s;t with much ado they got</HI>
<PB N="124" REF="327">
<HI>off one of the under workmen, who&s;e name was</HI> Frederick Cor&s;ells <HI>(or rather</HI> Cor&s;ellis), <HI>who late one night &s;tole from his fellows in di&s;gui&s;e into a ve&s;&s;el, pre|par'd before for that purpo&s;e, and &s;o the wind (favouring the de&s;ign) brought him &s;afe to</HI> London.</P>
<P><HI>'Twas not thought &s;o prudent to &s;et him on work at</HI> London, <HI>but by the archbi&s;hop's means, who had been vice-chancellor, and afterwards chancellor of the univer&s;ity of</HI> Oxon, Cor&s;ellis <HI>was carry'd with a &s;trong guard to</HI> Oxon; <HI>which guard con&s;tantly watch'd to prevent</HI> Cor&s;ellis <HI>from any po&s;&s;i|ble e&s;cape, till he had made good his promi&s;e, in teaching how to print: &s;o that at</HI> Oxford, <HI>printing was fir&s;t &s;et up in</HI> England; <HI>which was before there was any printing-pre&s;s or printer in</HI> France, Spain, Italy <HI>or</HI> Germany, <HI>except the city of</HI> Mentz, <HI>which claims &s;eniority as to printing even of</HI> Har|lem <HI>it&s;elf, calling her&s;elf</HI> Urbem Moguntinam Artis Typographicae inven|tricem primam; <HI>tho' 'tis known to be otherwi&s;e, that city gaining that art by the brother of one of the workmen of</HI> Harlem, <HI>who had learn'd it at home of his brother, and after &s;et up for him&s;elf at</HI> Mentz.</P>
<P><HI>This pre&s;s at</HI> Oxon <HI>was at lea&s;t ten years before there was any printing in</HI> Europe, <HI>(except at</HI> Harlem <HI>and</HI> Mentz), <HI>where al&s;o it was but new born. This pre&s;s at</HI> Oxford <HI>was afterwards found inconvenient to be the &s;ole printing place of</HI> England, <HI>as being too far from</HI> London, <HI>and the Sea: whereupon the king &s;et up a pre&s;s at St.</HI> Albans, <HI>and another in the Abby of</HI> We&s;tmin&s;ter, <HI>where they printed &s;everal books of divinity and Phy&s;ick, for the King, for rea&s;ons be&s;t known to him&s;elf and council, permitted then no law-books to be printed, nor did any Printer exerci&s;e that art, but only &s;uch as were the king's &s;worn &s;ervants; the king him&s;elf having the price and emo|lument for printing books.</HI></P>
<P>THUS far the chronicle, or our author's extract from it; for, as I ob|&s;erv'd before, he di&s;tingui&s;hes not his own from the chronicle, nor ac|quaints us whether it be literally copied from the chronicle, or an ab&s;tract of it; nor whether it mentions any other tran&s;actions be&s;ides that of bring|ing printing to <HI>England.</HI> I &s;hall therefore follow him no further, at pre|&s;ent, but examine the truth of the &s;everal particulars of this account: yet previous to this, I &s;hall ob&s;erve, that we have the like account of this affair in Antony Wood<HI>'s Hi&s;tory and Antiquities of the Univer&s;ity of</HI> Ox|ford, printed in 1674, <HI>i. e.</HI> ten years after <HI>Atkins</HI> had publi&s;h'd his piece;
<PB N="125" REF="328">
from which the foremention'd author &s;eems to have taken his account wholly; in many particulars, of which he has been confuted by &s;everal writers, as &s;hall be &s;hewn immediately. To return to <HI>Atkins's</HI> book; which is unknown to foreigners, and &s;een but by few in <HI>England;</HI> the author of that chronicle is mi&s;taken in &s;everal points; 1. in &s;uppo&s;ing <HI>Har|lem</HI> or <HI>Harlein,</HI> as he calls it, to be the place from whence <HI>Cor&s;ellis</HI> came: It is not probable, that the art was invented there, e&s;pecially by <HI>Guttenbergh,</HI> and in the year 1459, &s;ince it appears, the p&s;alter was prin|at <HI>Mentz</HI> by <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> two years before that, be&s;ides the &s;everal books printed on wooden blocks. Again, if the book mention'd by <HI>Atkins</HI> and <HI>Wood</HI> to have been printed at <HI>Oxford, anno</HI> 1468, be the fir&s;t book print|ted there, 'tis plain, that city had not the art ten years before any other; becau&s;e I have lately &s;een a book printed at <HI>Strasburg</HI> by <HI>John Gutten|berg,</HI> in 1458, as I have already hinted in the po&s;tcript of the foregoing number; be&s;ides <HI>Strasburg,</HI> it was at <HI>Venice,</HI> the mona&s;tery of <HI>Sublaco, Au&s;|burgh, Rome</HI> and <HI>France</HI> before 1468. If it be urg'd, that there might be other books printed before that at <HI>Oxford,</HI> or that it requir'd &s;ome time to get all the nece&s;&s;ary materials of a printing-hou&s;e; the &s;ame pleas will equally &s;erve for tho&s;e other places now mention'd. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> if we admit <HI>Gut|tenbergh</HI> to have carried the art to <HI>Holland,</HI> which we &s;hall &s;hew here|after to be extremely probable, it will be &s;till fal&s;e, that <HI>Mentz</HI> receiv'd it from the brother of one of his workmen. The&s;e are the incon&s;i&s;ten|cies and contradictions to plain facts, now certainly known, which dero|gate from the authority of this chronicle and of tho&s;e that follow it. We &s;hall now endeavour to clear the&s;e incon&s;i&s;tencies, or at lea&s;t to &s;hew how the author of it was led into the&s;e palpable errors, and from thence to di&s;cover the real truth of the whole tran&s;action.</P>
<P>WE have already hinted at the probability, that he rather followed the reports &s;pread about from <HI>Holland,</HI> than made a &s;trict enquiry into this &s;ubject. This will appear more plain from the following con&s;idera|tions. 1. We hinted in our 1&s;t book, that during the infancy of the art, <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> and <HI>Schoeffer,</HI> and together with them <HI>Guttenbergh,</HI> carry'd on the bu&s;ine&s;s with all po&s;&s;ible &s;ecrecy, till the former being oblig'd to di&s;cover it at <HI>Paris</HI> for his own &s;afety, and the latter having broke the partner&s;hip, and gone to &s;et up the art el&s;ewhere; it was thought of no
<PB N="126" REF="329">
further u&s;e to conceal this invention. 2. The reader may call to mind that we advanc'd a probable conjecture of Mr. <HI>Mattaire</HI>'s, that <HI>Gutten|bergh</HI> being ca&s;t at law, and &s;entenc'd to reimbur&s;e his moiety, and pay the charges of the &s;uit, went away to <HI>Strasburgh</HI> to evade the &s;entence, which is now confirm'd by the book printed there ju&s;t now mentioned; where not thinking him&s;elf fafe from further pro&s;ecution, he might really come down to <HI>Harlem,</HI> and there in&s;truct <HI>Co&s;ter,</HI> or &s;ome others in the art. This &s;eems to be more than probable, not only from the chronicle's mentioning <HI>Guttenbergh,</HI> and not <HI>Co&s;ter,</HI> as inventor of the art, but like|wi&s;e from his dating the invention nine years later than it was di&s;cover'd; which mu&s;t be a&s;crib'd to its not having been known at <HI>Harlem</HI> till the year 1459, tho' it had been practis'd at <HI>Mentz</HI> from the year 1450, or &s;oon after, as has been &s;ufficiently &s;hewn before.</P>
<P>AGAIN, if we con&s;ider that <HI>Holland</HI> and the <HI>Low-Countries</HI> were the only places of <HI>Germany,</HI> into which we traded, whereas the city of <HI>Mentz,</HI> which lies very far in the continent, was then little known to us, we &s;hall not wonder, that our fir&s;t accounts of the original of printing, &s;hould be taken from the <HI>Dutch,</HI> agreeable to their violent claims to the invention of it, and their &s;candalous &s;tories invented to deprive <HI>Fau&s;t</HI> of his di&s;co|very; for the chronicle acquaints us, that the city receiv'd it from a fu|gitive &s;ervant of <HI>Guttenbergh,</HI> who had learn'd it from his brother then working with him, and went to &s;et it up there. There remains one &s;in|gle difficulty &s;till; why the chronicle attributes the invention to <HI>Gutten|bergh,</HI> when all their writers make no mention of him, but a&s;cribe it wholly to their countryman <HI>Co&s;ter.</HI> To &s;olve this, if we &s;uppo&s;e this account given to the author by <HI>Frederick Cor&s;ellis,</HI> or even by Mr. <HI>Caxton</HI> or <HI>Tur|nour,</HI> which is very probable; we may ju&s;tly pre&s;ume, that they &s;poke as they were inform'd on the &s;pot, agreeably to the account which <HI>Gut|tenbergh</HI> gave of him&s;elf and of his invention, which the <HI>Dutch</HI> dar'd not to contradict, till after his death or departure from <HI>Holland,</HI> when they a&s;&s;um'd the whole di&s;covery to them&s;elves, and repre&s;ented <HI>Co&s;ter</HI> as the &s;ole inventor, exclu&s;ive of every other preten&s;ion. I have dwelt longer on the&s;e circum&s;tances, becau&s;e they notoriou&s;ly demon|&s;trate, that tho&s;e contradictions to plain facts, univer&s;ally known and a&s;|&s;ented to by all but the <HI>Dutch</HI> writers, confirm the authority of the re&s;t
<PB N="127" REF="330">
of the chronicle; &s;ince they are exactly drawn from the legends of that nation, which were then generally believ'd over all the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> and were the only accounts that our merchants, and particularly the two gentlemen employ'd by the king, could procure concerning the original of printing. And 'tis not improbable that what the chronicle mentions of the impri&s;onment of &s;everal per&s;ons at <HI>Harlem,</HI> on &s;u&s;picion of a de&s;ign to &s;teal the art, might be done rather out of fear lea&s;t any of tho&s;e &s;trangers &s;hould rob them of their honour by expo&s;ing the vantiy of their preten&s;i|ons; &s;ince them&s;elves could not be ignorant of what was done at <HI>Mentz</HI> long before that time.</P>
<P>BEFORE I di&s;mi&s;s this chronicle,) which, as I ob&s;erv'd, was unknown till Mr. <HI>Atkins</HI> publi&s;h'd it, I &s;hall give an account, which I found in a manu&s;cript now in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which &s;eems to be much older than the year 1664, when Mr. <HI>Atkins</HI> publi&s;h'd his account, and which, a few Circum&s;tances excepted, entirely agrees with that of the chronicle. The part relating to the introducing of printing into <HI>England</HI> being very &s;hort, I believe will be acceptable to the reader, and is as follows.</P>
<P><HI>The ri&s;e and progre&s;s of printing in</HI> England.</P>
<P><HI>The art of printing was fir&s;t brought into</HI> England <HI>in the time of</HI> Hen. vi. <HI>at the charges of the archbi&s;hop of</HI> Canterbury (Bourchier,) <HI>who employ'd one</HI> Turner <HI>ma&s;ter of the robes to the king, and one Mr.</HI> Caxton <HI>a mercer of</HI> Lon|don, <HI>but u&s;ing the trade of a merchant, to go to</HI> Harlem <HI>to endeavour to bring over &s;ome of the workmen, that had then newly practis'd the art there, who pre|vail'd upon &s;ome of the under-workmen to come over with them into</HI> England, <HI>and to teach them their trade. As &s;oon as they were landed, they were convey'd under a guard to the univer&s;ity of</HI> Oxford <HI>for fear they &s;hould run back again; and there they &s;et up a pre&s;s about the year</HI> 1467, <HI>as appears by &s;everal books that were printed there about that time. The names of tho&s;e workmen were</HI> Rood <HI>an</HI> Almayn <HI>(or</HI> German) <HI>and</HI> Winken de Worde; <HI>and the charges of the journey co&s;t the archbi&s;hop</HI> 1500 <HI>marks, as appears by &s;everal papers and memorials relating to this matter, that are &s;till extant in the library at</HI> Lam|beth. <HI>Shortly after there was a pre&s;s &s;et up at the Abbey of St.</HI> Albans, <HI>which continued till the di&s;&s;olution,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE remainder being foreign to this chapter, &s;hall be communicated in &s;ome of the following, to which it more properly belongs. I need not ob&s;erve that this manu&s;cript a&s;cribes all the honour of this tran&s;action to
<PB N="128" REF="331">
the archbi&s;ho&s;hp; whereas the chronicle a&s;&s;ures us that the king contri|buted the greate&s;t &s;um towards it. The date mention'd in my manu&s;cript is a year before the <HI>Oxford</HI> edition came out.</P>
<P>It may be here objected that the year 1467 cannot bring it within the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. who had been depos'd &s;ix years before; but I an&s;wer that the manu&s;cript does not a&s;&s;ert that the <HI>Dutch</HI> printers came not into <HI>England</HI> till that year, but that their pre&s;s was not &s;et up till then; and tho' this happen'd in another reign, yet it will &s;till be true that king <HI>Henry</HI> caus'd them to be brought over, whil&s;t he was upon the throne, tho' the civil wars, and his being depos'd, put a &s;top to their proceedings for &s;ix or &s;even years. We &s;hall have occa&s;ion to remark further upon this in the next chapter. As for its complementing the archbi&s;hop with having been at the whole expence of the journey; it may be a&s;crib'd to want of better information, or partiality to that prelate, who might &s;till be in great e&s;teem under king <HI>Edward;</HI> whil&s;t the good king <HI>Henry</HI> was &s;trip'd of the royal dignity and wholly neglected. With re&s;pect to the two printers men|tion'd there; the fir&s;t is probably the &s;ame, <HI>Theodoric Rood,</HI> who printed afterwards by him&s;elf, and of whom we have but two editions printed at <HI>Oxford</HI> in 1480, and 1481, of which we &s;hall give a further account in the next chapter. Whether he came along with <HI>Cor&s;ellis</HI> as an under-work|man, is difficult to determine,</P>
<P>I am of opinion that <HI>Winken de Worde</HI> came not to <HI>England</HI> till &s;ome years after; tho' he might ea&s;ily be confounded by the author of the M. S. with the other, on account of his <HI>Dutch</HI> name, and of his having &s;ignaliz'd him&s;elf afterwards by the number and elegance of his editions, which he printed both under <HI>Caxton</HI> and by him&s;elf. Thus 'tis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ain that the few re|cords, which we have, agree in the following particulars; that archbi&s;hop <HI>Bourchier</HI> &s;ollicited king <HI>Henry</HI> VI. to procure the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the art of printing in this kingdom; that the king not only con&s;ented, but con|tributed largely to it; that <HI>Turner</HI> and <HI>Caxton</HI> were employ'd in this de&s;ign; that it co&s;t 1500 marks to execute it; that it was happily effected during the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. i. e. before the year 1461, &s;ince in the be|ginning of that year he was depos'd by <HI>Edward</HI> IV. and la&s;tly, that <HI>Ox|ford</HI> was fix'd upon by the king and Archbi&s;hop to &s;et up the fir&s;t pre&s;s in, and make the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays of this art; which city therefore &s;hall be the &s;ubject of our next chapter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>Printing at</HI> Oxford <HI>by</HI> Frederic Cor&s;ellis.</HEAD>
<P>SOME <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> authors, and particularly Mr. <HI>Howel,</HI> are of opinion, that the fir&s;t trials of this art were made in the <HI>Ambry</HI> belonging to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abby,</HI> where Mr. <HI>Caxton</HI> afterwards carry'd on the bu&s;ine&s;s with good &s;ucce&s;s for a con&s;iderable time; as &s;hall be related in its place. But as they affirm this upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the Abbot of that place, <HI>[I&s;lip],</HI> was the per&s;on, who procur'd the art to be brought to <HI>England;</HI> whereas the chronicle abovemention'd, which they knew nothing of, a&s;|&s;erts the contrary; in both the&s;e re&s;pects, I think it more rea&s;onable to follow it, than tho&s;e writers: nor indeed is it probable, that any but a crown'd head, or &s;ome per&s;ons employ'd by him, would venture upon &s;uch a dangerous project. Be&s;ides, this account of the chronicle is con|firm'd by the edition of 1468, mention'd in the preceding chapter, of which we &s;hall &s;peak more fully hereafter: for tho' this comes &s;hort in date of the la&s;t year of <HI>Henry</HI> VI, by &s;even or eight years, yet it is older by at lea&s;t as many, than any impre&s;&s;ion of <HI>Caxton</HI>'s at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> as far as has been yet di&s;cover'd. Add to this, that according to their Suppo|&s;ition, that Mr. <HI>Caxton</HI> learn'd the art from the workman brought over from <HI>Holland,</HI> we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;e the latter to have made &s;everal e&s;&s;ays, and printed a volume or two at lea&s;t, before the former could be perfect enough in it to engage in that province. But I am far from think|ing, that <HI>Caxton</HI> either learn'd the art from him, or even came over to <HI>England</HI> with him; &s;ince 'tis much more probable, that he di&s;patch'd Mr. <HI>Turnour</HI> with <HI>Cor&s;ellis</HI> thither, and carried on his commerce as well as his &s;tudies beyond &s;ea. I am inclin'd to this opinion, by a pa&s;&s;age in the preface to the &s;econd book of his <HI>hi&s;tory of Troy,</HI> which he tells us he tran&s;|lated from the <HI>French</HI> at the de&s;ire of the <HI>Dutche&s;s of Burgundy,</HI> the King's &s;i&s;ter; which tran&s;lation, he &s;ays, he began at <HI>Bruges,</HI> anno 1468, conti|nued at <HI>Gaunt,</HI> and fini&s;h'd at <HI>Cologn,</HI> anno <HI>a thou&s;and four honderd</HI> lxxi.

three years after the fir&s;t edition printed by <HI>Cor&s;ellis</HI> at <HI>Oxford:</HI> nor does it appear, that <HI>Caxton</HI> came pre&s;ently after to <HI>England,</HI> but &s;tay'd to write a third book in the la&s;t mention'd place, <HI>Cologn,</HI> as he informs us in the&s;e words; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>The third book of the de&s;truction of</HI> Troy<HI>&mdash;I have now good leyzer in</HI> Cologn<HI>&mdash;I have delibered in my &s;elf beyng&mdash;to take thislaboure in hand</HI>"</Q> 'Tis unrea&s;onable to ima|gine, that a man of his years, (of which he complains in the &s;ame pre|face, &s;aying, that <HI>age crept on him daily and feebled all the body,)</HI> &s;hould come along with the <HI>Dutch</HI> Printer, and learn the art from him, and then go travelling again, having one book to tran&s;late, and ano|ther to write, <HI>viz.</HI> his <HI>Fruits of Time.</HI> I am of opinion therefore, that he learn'd the art, at lea&s;t got a good in&s;ight into it abroad, and per|haps at <HI>Cologn;</HI> tho' he might make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the practical part of it after his return into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>THUS far therefore 'tis plain, that <HI>Caxton</HI> had been on his travels &s;ome time, when <HI>Cor&s;ellis</HI> printed that fir&s;t edition at <HI>Oxford;</HI> that the latter was the fir&s;t Printer in <HI>England;</HI> and that <HI>Oxford</HI> was the place, where the fir&s;t pre&s;s was &s;et up. The chronicle gives the&s;e rea&s;ons why that Printer was &s;ent thither; 1. Becau&s;e it was an inland town, out of which it would be le&s;s po&s;&s;ible for him to e&s;cape, than from <HI>London</HI> or any place near the &s;ea; 2. Archbi&s;hop <HI>Bourchier,</HI> who had been vice-chan|cellor, and was then chancellor of that univer&s;ity, may be &s;uppos'd to have had a more than ordinary regard for it, and, in con&s;equence of that, to have prevail'd upon the King to honour it with the fir&s;t pre&s;s. To the&s;e we may add the two following, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. That an univer&s;ity was the mo&s;t proper place for &s;uch a work; becau&s;e it would &s;till be under the eye and direction of the learned men there, who could make choice of the be&s;t works to be printed, the be&s;t MSS. to print from, and the mo&s;t skilful per&s;ons to correct them; 2. the city of <HI>London,</HI> and almo&s;t the whole kingdom being di&s;turb'd and divided by the <HI>Earl of March</HI>'s par|ty&punc; and the court engag'd in oppo&s;ing his mea&s;ures, an univer&s;ity was a much &s;afer and quieter place to lay the foundation of this art in, than any other in the kingdom. <HI>Cor&s;ellis</HI> therefore, and tho&s;e to whom he was to di&s;cover the &s;ecret, having &s;worn fidelity to the king and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and being admitted into the number of the king's &s;ervants and
<PB N="131" REF="334">
hou&s;hold, began to exerci&s;e this art as &s;oon as they had got all things ready for it. How long they were thus employ'd in their preparations, and what progre&s;s they made after I &s;hall next enquire.</P>
<P>THE reader will have ju&s;t cau&s;e to admire, that, if they began &s;o &s;oon as the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> VI's reign, <HI>viz.</HI> before <HI>anna</HI> 1461, they &s;hould have publi&s;h'd no work yet di&s;cover'd till &s;even years after, <HI>viz.</HI> 1468; and that there are but three editions extant between that time and the year 1481, the edition of 1468 included; and, what is &s;till more ad|mirable, that from that year to 1585, which is above 100 years, thee is not one volume to be found printed at <HI>Oxford,</HI> tho' the art flouri&s;h'd in &s;everal other parts of <HI>England,</HI> as will appear in the progre&s;s of this hi&s;tory. This la&s;t particular I can by no means account for; but the other, I mean their &s;low progre&s;s at fir&s;t, is ea&s;ily &s;olv'd by what has been hinted before, <HI>viz.</HI> the troubles which were then breaking forth, and fell upon the king and court, as well as his depo&s;ition, which hap|pen'd immediately after their fir&s;t &s;ettlement in that univer&s;ity, together with the oppo&s;ition made continually by his Queen and friends again&s;t his victorious rival. Be&s;ides, if we con&s;ider that the Printers were &s;worn &s;ervants to the crown, and con&s;equently incapable to act without the king's &s;pecial order, or at lea&s;t his licence, whil&s;t <HI>Henry</HI> their Patron was out of power, and the reigning monarch otherwi&s;e employ'd, it will be very ea&s;y to account for the&s;e delays, and the &s;mall progre&s;s which they made in tho&s;e trouble&s;ome times. We may likewi&s;e with great probability &s;uppo&s;e, that mo&s;t of their works were &s;uch as were adapted to tho&s;e times of &s;uper&s;tition, as prayer-books, manuals, legends, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which peri&s;h'd &s;oon after the reformation.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be own'd indeed, that the author of the chronicle, &s;o often mention'd, tells us, that as &s;oon as <HI>Cor&s;ellis</HI> had perform'd his promi&s;e, and in&s;tructed a &s;ufficient number of others in the art, it was thought proper to di&s;per&s;e them, &s;ome to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> others to <HI>St. Albans,</HI> &amp;c. Yet it is &s;till very &s;urprizing, that &s;o con&s;iderable a place as <HI>Oxford</HI> could not detain one of them by a &s;ufficient encouragement. However, 'tis plain, that except <HI>Theodoric Rood,</HI> a <HI>German,</HI> and native of <HI>Cologn,</HI> who very probably came over with Mr. <HI>Caxton</HI> from thence, and of whom we have di&s;cover'd but two editions, there are no other foot&s;teps of
<PB N="132" REF="335">
printing in this univer&s;ity extant from that time to 1585, nor any tole|rable account among the writers of tho&s;e times for &s;uch a wonderful &s;car|city. But this is not the only thing which the reader will be &s;urpriz'd at, with relation to the &s;low progre&s;s which printing made at <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>I have, in the former book, given an account of va&s;t improvements made to that art in foreign countries, and to what a degree of perfection the <HI>Italians</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> in particular, had brought it, not only with re&s;pect to the exqui&s;ite beauty and variety of characters, richne&s;s and ele|gancy of compo&s;ition, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but likewi&s;e by their introducing the learned and ea&s;tern languages, as <HI>Greek, Hebrew, Arabic,</HI> &amp;c. into their print|ing-hou&s;es, even before the year 1520, and printing &s;everal curious po|lyglot works in all the&s;e tongues, be&s;ides the <HI>Latin.</HI> But tho' I have ex|tended this <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> hi&s;tory thirty years further than theirs, <HI>viz.</HI> to the year 1550, yet the reader mu&s;t not expect to find any thing of this na|ture done in <HI>England</HI> during that time. Our fir&s;t Printers, tho' excel|lent men in their way, contented them&s;elves with printing in their own tongue; and if they ventur'd &s;ometimes either upon <HI>Latin</HI> or <HI>French,</HI> their productions in tho&s;e languages were few and incon&s;iderable: but with re&s;pect to <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Hebrew,</HI> either thro' want of due encouragement from the learned, or of courage in them, 'tis certain they never attempt|ed any thing of that kind till a long time after.</P>
<P>THE reader may remember with what difficulty the <HI>Pari&s;ian</HI> Print|ers were prevail'd upon to venture upon &s;uch works; what objections and ob&s;tacles they rais'd again&s;t &s;o expen&s;ive and hazardous an underta|king: yet a learned <HI>Frenchman</HI> &s;o far prevail'd with &s;ome of them, that he had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing &s;everal of his own works printed in tho&s;e languages; the reception of which &s;oon encourag'd them to proceed in &s;everal noble undertakings. But the ca&s;e was far different in <HI>England:</HI> for the learned Dr. <HI>Wakefield,</HI> having made an oration in 1584, to re|commend the &s;tudy of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Arabic</HI> tongues, and &s;hew the u&s;efulne&s;s and nece&s;&s;ity of them, was oblig'd to publi&s;h it maim'd and imperfect, wanting near a third part, becau&s;e, as he tells us, the Print|ers of that time had no <HI>Hebrew</HI> types; tho' it was printed by <HI>Wynken de Worde,</HI> one of the mo&s;t eminent Printers in <HI>Europe</HI> of that age. Printing in <HI>Greek</HI> made no great figure in <HI>England</HI> before the 16th cen|tury;
<PB N="133" REF="336">
and the mo&s;t learned work, which we have to boa&s;t of, was the po|lyglot bible of Dr. <HI>Walton,</HI> mention'd at the latter end of the la&s;t book, which was not printed till after the re&s;toration by Mr. <HI>Thomas Roycroft,</HI> of whom I &s;hall &s;ay more hereafter.</P>
<P>EXCEPT this, I don't find any foot&s;teps of any works in the poly|glot kind, but what were &s;mall and incon&s;iderable. However, we, like the <HI>Dutch,</HI> have &s;ufficiently &s;ince atton'd for the &s;low progre&s;s which our ance&s;tors made in tho&s;e noble branches of printing.</P>

'Tis as follows.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'IT is agreed, that <HI>Cor&s;ellis</HI> was the fir&s;t who printed in <HI>England,</HI> and that <HI>Oxford</HI> and St. <HI>Albans</HI> were the two fir&s;t places; the types, as may be &s;een in my Lord's books, at <HI>Oxford</HI> were like tho&s;e of <HI>Fau&s;t;</HI> the types of this at St. <HI>Albans</HI> are like the <HI>Dutch Spieghel. Junius</HI> argues for the fir&s;t printing to be at <HI>Harlem</HI> from the <HI>Dutch Spieghel;</HI> but it appears from what is writ before the five books, call'd <HI>Paginae Conglutinatoe,</HI> that the <HI>Latin</HI> one of this <HI>Dutch</HI> was before it, the which he had not &s;een, neither does it conclude where it was printed; however, this book of St. <HI>Albans</HI> affords an argument, which <HI>Junius</HI> could not then know of, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> letter might be before 1460, and it favours what <HI>At|kins</HI> &s;ays of a pre&s;s brought over from <HI>Harlem</HI> in the time of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. who dy'd in 1460. This is the &s;ame letter, and we read that <HI>Frederick Cor&s;ellis</HI> did at St. <HI>Albans</HI> in&s;truct an old learned &s;chool-ma&s;ter to print, and <HI>Cor&s;ellis</HI> was of a con&s;iderable age when <HI>Theodoric de Rood</HI> of <HI>Colen</HI> &s;ucceeded him at <HI>Oxford,</HI> by whom we have two books printed; the fir&s;t as old as 1480, already taken notice of. It has been a doubt, whether
<PB N="136" REF="339">
they fir&s;t printed at St. <HI>Albans</HI> or at <HI>Oxford,</HI> the olde&s;t book of St. <HI>Al|bans</HI> with a date is here; but we cannot prove this book of <HI>Mi&s;cellanies</HI> to be older than the di&s;&s;olution of the Abbies by K. <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. 'till when a pre&s;s remain'd, and the fir&s;t letter us'd as late as 1490, &s;uch a year appearing in this book. We know of but one more book at St. <HI>Albans,</HI> the which my Lord al&s;o has; it di&s;covers that there was another pre&s;s &s;et up at St. <HI>Albans</HI> after this, with the letter of the <HI>Spieghel,</HI> be|cau&s;e that is printed with <HI>Caxton</HI>'s types, and hath (as <HI>Caxton</HI>'s books have) the two improvements of indenting paragraphs, and dividing words by hyphens at the ends of the lines; the Printers of this, with the letter of the <HI>Spieghel,</HI> continu'd to print as they began, without the two im|provements, even after the pre&s;s of <HI>Caxton;</HI> tho' even here that pre&s;s us'd his improvements. This other book is dated 1486 in words at length, at the end of the book of hunting, be&s;ides the arms of that mo|na&s;tery, which are at the end of the whole book. <HI>Spelman</HI> in his <HI>A&s;pilo|gia,</HI> quotes the whole book, as wrote by <HI>Juliana Barnes,</HI> and is &s;o referr'd to by <HI>Bale</HI> in his <HI>Scriptores,</HI> tho' &s;he appears to be the author only of the piece of hunting; the treati&s;e in that book of coat arms, is only a tran&s;lation of <HI>Upton de re Militari.</HI> That printed by <HI>Caxton</HI> at <HI>We&s;tmin|&s;ter</HI> in 1496, was a &s;econd edition of this book.
<P>OF this, with the types of the <HI>Spieghel,</HI> there is a &s;econd edition in 1529, printed by <HI>Winken de Worde;</HI> it con&s;i&s;ts of mi&s;cellanies, and has &s;ome|thing very remarkable, as the old tryal in K. <HI>Henry</HI> VI's time at <HI>Leice&s;|ter,</HI> (not taken notice of in our great collection of &s;tate-tryals) of the cardinal of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> impeach'd by the Duke of <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> before the <HI>Hou&s;e of Lords,</HI> in which appears the names of the mitred Abbots among the Lords &s;piritual and temporal, and the form of the clerks entring as they came in, and at different times took the oaths.

I think it will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ubjoin his own account of him&s;elf in this re&s;pect, from his preface to the <HI>Recule of the Hi&s;toryes of Troye,</HI> tran&s;lated by him out of the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Raoul le Fevre, Prie&s;t.&mdash;</HI><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'When I re|member my&s;elf of my unperfitne&s;s in both languages.&mdash;In <HI>Fraunce</HI> was I never, and was born and lerned myne <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in <HI>Kente</HI> in the Weeld, where <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> is &s;poken broad and rude.&mdash;I have continu|ed for the mo&s;t part in the countries of <HI>Brabant, Flanders, Holland</HI> and <HI>Zeland.&mdash;</HI>The Dutche&s;&s;e of BOURGOGNE &s;i&s;ter of the king of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> when &s;he had &s;een v or vi quairs, found default in myn <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> which &s;he commaunded me to ammand, and to continue and make an end of the re&s;idue,&mdash;who&s;e commaund I dur&s;t not di&s;obey.'</Q>&mdash;Thus far Mr. <HI>Caxton:</HI> and I can't but ob&s;erve, that the faults of his <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> are owing more to his long continuance abroad, than to the place of his birth; which will ea&s;ily appear from an accurate ob&s;ervation of his lan|guage and manner of &s;pelling, which di&s;cover the foreigner more than a broad-&s;poken <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> man. His education was owing to his mother, and extended no farther than to read and write, which, he &s;ays, procur'd him a good maintenance. Mr. <HI>Bale</HI> tells us indeed, that he under&s;tood the <HI>La|tin</HI> tongue; which is plain, from his tran&s;lations out of that language.
<PB N="139" REF="344">
But, as he does not mention it as a part of his youthful education, 'tis very probable that he did not apply him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of it till a long time after. He was bred a mercer of the city of <HI>London,</HI> and became a <HI>Con|jurys</HI> thereof, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have indeed, thro' the favour of Mr. <HI>Crump,</HI> at <HI>Mercer</HI>'s hall, &s;earch'd their book of freemen, but could not find his name there. There was one <HI>Richard Caxton</HI> made free a|bout that time, whether it was a relation of his, or a mi&s;take in tran&s;cribing his chri|&s;tian name, I cannot be &s;ure of; but howe|ver, as he calls him&s;elf a <HI>Mercer</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> we have no rea&s;on to doubt it.</NOTE> as he &s;tiles him&s;elf in his preface to <HI>Cato,</HI> that is, a &s;worn member of that company, which in tho&s;e days con&s;i&s;ted of very con&s;i|derable merchants, trading more particularly into the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> and &s;ome of the maritime parts of <HI>Germany.</HI> To the&s;e he was frequently &s;ent, but never had the fortune to vi&s;it <HI>France;</HI> tho' he became &s;o good a ma&s;ter of that language, as to tran&s;late &s;everal volumes into <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> of which we &s;hall give an account hereafter. His travels likewi&s;e &s;o well accom|pli&s;h'd him in the <HI>High</HI> and <HI>Low-Dutch,</HI> that upon the account of this, and his knowledge of tho&s;e countries and their trade, the king cho&s;e him as a fit per&s;on to undertake the bringing printing to <HI>England.</HI> This ta&s;k, how difficult and hazardous &s;oever, he acquitted him&s;elf with great integrity.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Caxton,</HI> be&s;ides his accompli&s;hments as a merchant, acquired a great deal of politene&s;s, partly by his travels for 30 years, and partly by his frequent re&s;idence at the court of the dutche&s;s of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> &s;i&s;ter to king <HI>Edward</HI> IV, who care&s;s'd and patroniz'd him very much; for, in the preface abovemention'd, he tells us, that he was <HI>a &s;ervant to her grace, and received of her a yearly fee, and other many good and greate benefits.</HI> He was likewi&s;e a favourite to &s;everal of our kings, particularly <HI>Henry</HI> VI, <HI>Edward</HI> IV, <HI>Richard</HI> III, and <HI>Henry</HI> VII; and highly e&s;teem'd by the prime of our nobility, and e&s;pecially by the duke of <HI>Clarence,</HI> the king's uncle, to whom he dedicated &s;ome of his works; the counte&s;s of <HI>Derby,</HI> king <HI>Henry</HI> VII's mother; the earl of <HI>Rivers, Arundel,</HI> with many others. As he was a per&s;on indefatigable and ambitious of applau&s;e, as well as earne&s;t in promoting the glory of his own country, he read ince&s;&s;antly the
<PB N="140" REF="345">
hi&s;tories of his own and other nations; which at proper times he dige&s;ted into order. At his return to <HI>England,</HI> he became acquainted with a learn|ed &s;choolma&s;ter of <HI>St. Albans,</HI> &s;uppos'd by &s;ome writers upon good grounds to have been the printer of <HI>Juliana Barnes.</HI> This per&s;on, having laid the foundation of a compleat body of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> hi&s;tory, kept a con&s;tant corre|&s;pondence with Mr. <HI>Caxton,</HI> and was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by him in his tran&s;lations; but, being prevented by death from fini&s;hing his work, Mr. <HI>Caxtom</HI> pro|cur'd his papers, examin'd, and reduc'd them to order, and compar'd them with the be&s;t authors he could get, as <HI>Livy, St. Au&s;tin, Gildas, Be|da, I&s;idorus, Ca&s;&s;iodorus, Geoffrey of Monmouth, William of Malme&s;bury, Martin Can&s;ulanus,</HI> and others; from whom he al&s;o extracted many con&s;ide|rable pa&s;&s;ages, which he added to the hi&s;tory. This work he entitled <HI>Fru|ctus temporum,</HI> or the fruits of time, in &s;even books; to which he &s;ubjoin'd a chronology. The hi&s;tory begins with the giants, the fir&s;t &s;uppos'd inhabitants of this i&s;land, and concludes with the 23d year of <HI>Edward</HI> IV. viz. <HI>ann.</HI> 1483. What &s;hare our author had in this performance, and how great a part was done by the &s;choolma&s;ter, is impo&s;&s;ible to determine. This book was often reprinted and much valued at that time; yet, tho' it is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable piece which Mr. <HI>Caxton</HI> publi&s;h'd, we have &s;eve|ral others written and printed by him&s;elf, which are as follow:

The learned Mr. <HI>Selden</HI> indeed a&s;cribes the whole to <HI>Trevi&s;a;</HI> but, be&s;ides that, <HI>Caxton</HI> takes the &s;upplement and other additions and interpretations to him&s;elf; but 'tis plain, as Dr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> ob&s;erves, that <HI>Trevi&s;a,</HI> according to that &s;up|po&s;ition, mu&s;t have wrote near a hundred years after his death.

<P>BESIDES the&s;e, there are &s;everal others in the li&s;t of his printed works &s;ubjoin'd to the account of his life. He printed likewi&s;e &s;ome books in <HI>French,</HI> as <HI>La legende doree,</HI> &amp;c. and &s;ome in <HI>Latin,</HI> as <HI>Vita patruum</HI> and <HI>Boetius de con&s;olatione philo&s;ophiae,</HI> &amp;c. This catalogue of his works, as an author, I have taken from <HI>Pitts</HI> and <HI>Bale;</HI> the latter of whom gives him the character of <HI>vir non omnino &s;tupidus nec ignavia tor|pens,</HI> neither a perfect dunce nor abandon'd to lazine&s;s: I &s;hall more rea|dily a&s;&s;ent to the judgment of a much later and more judicious writer, Dr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> who &s;ays of <HI>Bale</HI> (p. 177) that he gives the account of men and their labours at random; and of <HI>Caxton</HI> (p. 190) that the op|portunities he had, of being acquainted with the court-tran&s;actions of his own time, would encourage his reader to hope for greater matters from him; but that his fancy &s;eems to have lead him into an undertaking (with re&s;pect to his <HI>Fructus temporum)</HI> above his &s;trength. There is one thing very ob&s;ervable concerning this excellent Printer and author, that he tran&s;lated, printed, corrected, illuminated and bound all his Books with|in his own office or printing-hou&s;e. As he printed long before the method of adding the errata at the end of books was in u&s;e, &s;o his extraor|dinary exactne&s;s oblig'd him to a great deal more trouble than can ea&s;ily be imagin'd; for he tells us, in the preface to &s;ome of his books, that his chief care, after a work was printed off, was to revi&s;e it, and mend all the faults with his own hand with red ink; which being done to one copy, he caus'd &s;ome of his journey-men to do the &s;ame throughout the whole impre&s;&s;ion; which he afterwards compar'd with his fir&s;t &s;heet, to &s;ee that
<PB N="142" REF="347">
they had not omitted any of his corrections. 'Tis true, they did not print off &s;o large a number of books as now; for 250 or 300 were thought a large impre&s;&s;ion; but even that number made it very tedious to cor|rect throughout: tho' this was practis'd by &s;everal eminent Printers of other nations, 'till they found out the way of printing the errata in &s;ome blank leaves of the book.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Caxton</HI> having made him&s;elf a perfect ma&s;ter of the Art of Printing (not at <HI>Oxford</HI> under <HI>Fred. Cor&s;ellis,</HI> as &s;ome authors imagine, but during his travels beyond &s;ea, as will appear hereafter) came and &s;ettled at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> where abbot <HI>I&s;lip</HI> (as &s;ome &s;ay) his friend and pa|tron, a&s;&s;ign'd him one of the chapels belonging to the abby, as we have before quoted from <HI>Newcourt,</HI> as being retir'd and free from interruption; and from this or &s;ome other chapel, 'tis &s;uppos'd that the name of cha|pel has been given to all printing-hou&s;es in <HI>England</HI> ever &s;ince. And not|with&s;tanding it is by &s;ome reported, that it was &s;et up in the cha|pel there, I can trace no foot&s;teps of its having been practis'd in that place. My manu&s;cript beforemention'd &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'that a pre&s;s was &s;et up in <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter</HI> abby by abbot <HI>I&s;lip,</HI> in the little ambry, where <HI>William Cax|ton</HI> was ma&s;ter.'</Q> Mr. <HI>Bagford</HI> a&s;&s;igns the hou&s;e in the ambry which was formerly the king's head, as the place where <HI>Caxton</HI> carried on his printing, but had I been early enough in my enquiry before 'twas pull'd down, as Mr. <HI>Bagford</HI> was, I flatter my &s;elf I could have found &s;ome remains. I have great rea&s;on to think it had been a printing-hou&s;e, by having been inform'd, that &s;ome per&s;ons found among the rubbi&s;h &s;ome remains of printing materials; but, thro' ignorance of the curio|&s;ity of them, they are either lo&s;t or de&s;troy'd. As I have given my rea|&s;ons again&s;t the arts being practis'd in the chapel at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> I rather think, that our technical terms in printing, &s;uch as a printing-hou&s;e being call'd a chapel; and where printing is grey in one place, and too black in another, the grey is call'd a fryar, and the black a monk; I think, I &s;ay, that the&s;e terms took their original from the art's being practis'd in other religious hou&s;es be&s;ides that at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter:</HI> for 'tis evident, by the book hereafter mention'd, printed in the exempt mona&s;tery of <HI>Tavi|&s;tock</HI> in <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> by <HI>Dan Thomas Richard,</HI> monk of the &s;aid mona&s;te|ry, that &s;everal of the religious orders exercis'd this art, perhaps in &s;ome
<PB N="143" REF="348">
outer chapel, which, being dedicated to &s;ome &s;aint, was only us'd once a year on the anniver&s;ary of that &s;aint.</P>
<P>THE reader will find, that printing-hou&s;es were &s;et up in &s;everal cities and towns in <HI>England,</HI> where they had any con&s;iderable religious hou&s;e. Thus we &s;ee the abby of St. <HI>Albans</HI> had printing there very &s;oon, as before notic'd. Nor was this the only religious hou&s;e where printing was practis'd, and that very early; for time has di&s;cover'd to us &s;everal others, &s;uch as <HI>Tavi&s;tock,</HI> as afore&s;aid, <HI>Worce&s;ter, Canterbury, Ip&s;wich;</HI> which were cho&s;en for that purpo&s;e. We have already hinted, that the fir&s;t Printers were &s;worn &s;ervants to the Crown; and in particular Mr. <HI>Caxton</HI> not only printed as &s;uch, but all his impre&s;&s;ions were recom|mended either by the king, or princes of the blood, or by &s;ome emi|nent patron among&s;t the nobility, who bore the charges of the whole. The types with which he printed were peculiar to him&s;elf, and ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h'd from any other, being a mixture of &s;ecretary and Gothic in &s;hape, the &s;ize great primer. He had &s;everal eminent workmen under him; particularly <HI>Winken de Worde,</HI> a Dutchman, and <HI>Rich. Pyn&s;on,</HI> a citizen of <HI>London,</HI> who afterwards printed for them&s;elves many valuable pieces, which &s;hall be mention'd in their proper place. They likewi&s;e us'd a letter peculiar to them&s;elves, which as I &s;hall take notice, differ'd from their ma&s;ter's, and was more refin'd and moderniz'd. Mr. <HI>Caxton,</HI> be|&s;ides his other valuable qualifications, was a per&s;on of exemplary piety and &s;trictne&s;s of life. He continu'd printing from before the year 1474 to 1495, as is evident from the end of the <HI>Vita patrum</HI> and <HI>Hilton</HI>'s <HI>&s;cale,</HI> printed, or rather fini&s;h'd, in that year by <HI>Winken de Worde.</HI> Mr. auditor <HI>Jett</HI> deceas'd, a&s;&s;ur'd me, that he was bury'd in St. <HI>Margaret</HI>'s church, <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter;</HI> and that he &s;aw the remains of his tomb-&s;tone, but I have not as yet been able to find it.</P>
<P>THE li&s;t of his works is as follows; in which I could not po&s;&s;ibly reco|ver the right titles of each book; but &s;uch as I could meet with, I have &s;et down exactly as printed by him. Tho&s;e which have no certain date are put at the end.</P>

<P>THIS edition, with &s;ome others, were communicated to me by a learned antiquary, in tho&s;e very words, but whether he was really the Printer of it, or only the author, and the book Printed by &s;ome other, is what I cannot determine, unle&s;s I could have &s;een the book.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="353">
Tho&s;e that follow are without date.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Liber fe&s;tialis.</HI></P>
<P>THIS edition, though I have given it no higher rank, upon the account of its having no date, doth yet manife&s;tly appear to me to have been the fir&s;t book extant of <HI>Caxton</HI>'s Printing. I have &s;een it at my Lord <HI>Pembroke</HI>'s library, and compar'd it with tho&s;e of the <HI>Game of Che&s;s,</HI> his three books of the hi&s;tory of <HI>Troy,</HI> and his <HI>Polychronicon;</HI> all which have been &s;everally look'd upon as his olde&s;t edition by one an|nali&s;t or other, and find in it the&s;e two unque&s;tionable marks of anti|quity above the other three, <HI>viz</HI> 1. The types on which it is printed appear to be entirely new, though they be the very &s;ame which he u&s;ed in all his other works; whereas, in the others they &s;eem to be more u&s;ed and worn. 2. This edition is the only one who&s;e lines are not &s;paced out to the end; this being an improvement and elegancy introduced by him in imitation of foreign Printers; whereas all the fir&s;t editions had the &s;ame defect with this.</P>
<P>As for the three books of the hi&s;tory of <HI>Troy,</HI> the &s;econd is that which I imagine to have been printed fir&s;t. I have &s;een it very perfect in &s;everal libraries, but the fir&s;t and third I never could meet with any where, but in the noble library above mention'd. And even here they are &s;omewhat imperfect, the fir&s;t book wanting a few leaves at the be|ginning, and the third at the end. However, they all bear alike the mark of antiquity, and are unque&s;tionably done with <HI>Caxton</HI>'s types. The olde&s;t book I could ever meet with that bears a date is his &s;econd edition of the <HI>Game at Che&s;s,</HI> in 1474, as may be &s;een by the catalogue above; and what inclines me to believe it to have been the fir&s;t of that kind, is that the &s;ame date 74 is continued in his following works that are dated, to which he &s;ometimes added the two initial letters of his name, as in the mark or rebus here &s;ubjoined.</P>

<HEAD>II. WINKEN DE WORDE. MCCCCXCV.</HEAD>
<P>WINKEN <HI>de Worde,</HI> the <HI>Dutchman,</HI> is &s;uppos'd to have come over with Mr. <HI>Caxton,</HI> and was his &s;ervant and journey-man. He &s;ucceeded him in his Printing-hou&s;e, as appears from &s;ome of his fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions done by him, as he tells us, <HI>in the hou&s;e of Mr. Caxton.</HI> It's difficult to a&s;&s;ign the exact time when he came to <HI>England;</HI> whether with <HI>Frederick Cor&s;ellis,</HI> as my manu&s;cript affirms, or &s;ome years after, which is more probable. After Mr. <HI>Caxton</HI>'s death, he carry'd on the bu&s;ine&s;s, and fini&s;h'd &s;ome volumes begun by his ma&s;ter, as the <HI>Canterbury-tales</HI> and <HI>Hilton's &s;cale of perfection.</HI> This la&s;t Mr. <HI>Mattaire</HI> dates in the year 1494, and Mr. <HI>Bagford</HI> 1465, who gives it as the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion done in <HI>Win|ken de Worde</HI>'s name. I have cho&s;en to follow Mr. <HI>Bagford,</HI> who was very exact, as far as he could procure materials; for I have not yet met with the book my &s;elf. Though the li&s;t of this Printer's works is very large, yet I am certain there are many more either lo&s;t or &s;till latent in &s;ome libraries; for he was a per&s;on of va&s;t indu&s;try, and re|ceiv'd all imaginable encouragement; &s;o that he publi&s;h'd &s;everal vo|lumes in one year, though we meet with &s;ome con&s;iderable cha&s;ms in others, during which time we cannot &s;uppo&s;e him idle. He left <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter,</HI> and &s;et up his Printing-hou&s;e in <HI>Fleet-&s;treet,</HI> at the &s;ign of the <HI>Sun,</HI> in the pari&s;h of <HI>St Bride.</HI> I cannot determine the year of his re|moval; though his fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion there was done, <HI>anno</HI> 1503. He printed &s;everal <HI>Latin,</HI> as well as <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> volumes, but no <HI>Greek,</HI> as I can find. He continued Printing with great applau&s;e till the year 1533,
<PB N="343" REF="356">
if not beyond that time. At his death he left a &s;um of money for an annual <HI>obiit</HI> for his &s;oul to the pari&s;h of <HI>St. Bride's,</HI> of which he was an inhabitant. He was a per&s;on of great accompli&s;hments in learning, as well as &s;trictne&s;s of morals; and though he was the immediate &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or of <HI>Caxton,</HI> yet he improv'd the art to a very great perfection. At his fir&s;t &s;etting up for him&s;elf, his fir&s;t care was to cut a new &s;ett of puncheons, which he &s;unk into matrices, and ca&s;t &s;everal &s;orts of Print|ing-letter, which he afterwards us'd. As <HI>Caxton</HI> us'd but two &s;izes, <HI>Double Pica</HI> and <HI>Great Primmer,</HI> viz.</P>
<P><HI>Begun and fini&s;hed by me &s;imple Man, W. C.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Begun and fini&s;hed by me &s;imple Man, W. C.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Winken de Worde</HI> gave a greater &s;cope to his fancy, and form'd &s;uch a variety of &s;orts and &s;izes of letter, that for &s;everal years after him, none of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors attempted to imitate him therein. If he was the ma|nual operator in cutting and ca&s;ting in his own founding-hou&s;e, 'tis an incredible improvement which he made to the art; but, if he had his letter from any other Printer abroad, though it robs him of this glory, yet his excellent method of di&s;po&s;ition, compo&s;ition, and pre&s;s|work, &s;hews him to have far excell'd his ma&s;ter, and even to rival any of of his contemporaries abroad. There is one circum&s;tance that induces me to think that he was his own letter-founder; which is, that in &s;ome of his fir&s;t Printed books, the very letter he made u&s;e of, is the &s;ame us'd by all the Printers in <HI>London</HI> to this day; and I believe were &s;truck from his puncheons.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is the two lin'd <HI>Great Primmer</HI> black,</P>

<P>The next is the <HI>Great Primmer</HI> black,</P>
<P><HI>This Work was fini&s;hed by me, Winken de Worde.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="357">
He is the fir&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Printer, who introduc'd the <HI>Roman</HI> letter in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> which he us'd with his <HI>Gothic</HI> or black letter, to di&s;tingui&s;h any thing remarkable, as we do the <HI>Italic</HI> with the <HI>Roman</HI> at this time. His letter is different from mo&s;t other Printers, and is ca&s;t &s;o true, and &s;tands &s;o well in line, as not to be excell'd by any ever &s;ince: in his <HI>Gothic</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> letter he fell in with the cu&s;tom of tho&s;e times by u&s;ing abbreviations, even in his &s;mall &s;iz'd letters. One circum&s;tance I would ob&s;erve is, that he is the only Printer I can find in <HI>England</HI> that us'd very &s;mall body'd letters in the infancy of the art, and he was fond even to the very la&s;t of u&s;ing his ma&s;ter <HI>Caxton</HI>'s rebus, of which we have given a &s;pecimen at the bottom of page 340. Upon the whole, he was a very curious, laborious, and indefatigable Printer; and I doubt not but time will add to his character, by bringing to light &s;ome noble te&s;timonies of &s;o great a man, which for want of, I am obliged to &s;ay &s;o little here. He is the fir&s;t Printer I have yet di&s;co|ver'd who began to print the year-books. <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">He and his Succe&s;&s;or <HI>Richard Pin&s;on Lincoln's-Inn</HI> Manu&s;cript-library, being in|printed above 40 year-books, which are in &s;crib'd <HI>Libri manu&s;cripti.</HI></NOTE></P>

</LIST>
<P>THIS curious piece is in the Lord <HI>Pembroke</HI>'s library, and has &s;ome ob&s;ervations written on a blank page at the beginning, which are to this effect; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'The eleven grammars printed by <HI>Winken de Worde,</HI> who was the 2d Printer in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> he lived afterwards within the walls of <HI>London,</HI> at the &s;ign of the <HI>Sun</HI> in <HI>Fleet-&s;treet. Richard Pin&s;on,</HI> af|terwards his worthy &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and he printed above 40 year-books which are in <HI>Lincoln's Inn</HI> Manu&s;cript library; they being in&s;cribed <HI>Libri Manu&s;cripti.</HI> He was &s;on-in-law to <HI>Caxton,</HI> who fir&s;t printed at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> in the Almonry beyond <HI>Westmin&s;ter-School.</HI> The&s;e eleven grammars were all printed above 100 years before <HI>Lily</HI>'s gram|mar, and appear to be the foundation of his.'</Q></P>
<P>WE &s;hall have occa&s;ion to give a further account of the&s;e year-books, when we come to &s;peak of <HI>R. Pin&s;on,</HI> who continued printing them a con|&s;iderable time after <HI>Winken de Worde</HI>'s death. As for the eleven gram|mars they are in one volume in the form of a very &s;mall quarto and neatly printed, and it is judiciou&s;ly ob&s;erved that they were printed above a century before that famous one of <HI>Lylly,</HI> which has been thought (and is &s;till, by tho&s;e who never heard of this edition,) to be the fir&s;t grammar that ever was printed in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="365">
FROM this large catalogue of <HI>Winken de Worde</HI>'s works, it is plain that he mu&s;t have been an indefatigable Printer; and that the cha&s;ms that frequently happen in &s;ome years mu&s;t be owing to the books being either lo&s;t, or as yet undi&s;cover'd; but more probably the former: and whoever con&s;iders that the greate&s;t part of them were either &s;chool-books, cla&s;&s;ics, prayer-books, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (be&s;ides a va&s;t number of popi&s;h ones, which might daily peri&s;h &s;oon after the Reformation) and of how &s;hort duration the former are in the hands of &s;chool-boys and devotees &s;uch as that age abounded with, will rather wonder that &s;o great a number of them have e&s;caped the common fate of &s;uch performances. So that we may ju&s;tly conclude, that the pre&s;ervation of the&s;e books is more owing to the character and excellency of the Printer than of the authors, and to the neatne&s;s and correctne&s;s of the work, rather than the goodne&s;s or u&s;efulne&s;s of the &s;ubject. After he was removed from <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> we do not hear of any other Printers at the for|mer; if there were any, they were &s;uch who&s;e works and memory in all probability died with, or &s;oon after them.</P>

<HEAD>The City of LONDON, MCCCCLXXXI.</HEAD>
<P>THO' <HI>Richard Pin&s;on</HI> be the fir&s;t known Printer that &s;et up his Pre&s;s in this famous city, and all former annali&s;ts have ranked it in their li&s;t from his fir&s;t edition, 1493; yet father <HI>Orlandi</HI> has &s;ince di&s;cover'd to us a much more antient one which was printed in <HI>Lon|don, anno</HI> 1481, that is 12 years before the former; which makes me hope that time may &s;till di&s;cover more, if not of older date, yet at lea&s;t to fill up the cha&s;m between this and the fir&s;t of <HI>Pin&s;on.</HI> For it is &s;carce to be &s;uppo&s;ed that <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> &s;hould begin &s;o &s;oon to encou|rage the art, as we have &s;een in the la&s;t article, and that <HI>London</HI> &s;hould wholly neglect it. However, be that how it will, it is certain that if it was but &s;low in receiving it, it made ample amends for it afterwards, and that <HI>Pin&s;on</HI> and <HI>De Worde,</HI> when he removed thither, gave a new life to it; &s;o that in a little time there were &s;everal con&s;iderable Print|ing-hou&s;es &s;et up in the mo&s;t convenient parts of this large metropolis,
<PB N="353" REF="366">
wherein it has flouri&s;hed and improved ever &s;ince. Some of tho&s;e emi|nent Printers received likewi&s;e great encouragement from the Crown, particularly by patents for printing of Bibles, and other works, of which I &s;hall give an account under the names of the Printers to whom they were granted.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> As <HI>Caxton</HI> printed all his works in the old letter, and <HI>W. de Worde</HI> in a mix'd character of Roman and Black, we have di&s;tingui&s;h'd their works in the two former catalogues, from tho&s;e that follow, by printing them in Italic: but, as the Roman types became by this time more common, we &s;hall give the li&s;t of the following Printers works in that character.</P>

<HEAD>I. RICHARD PINSON. Anno MCCCCXCIII.</HEAD>
<P>RICHARD PINSON, <HI>alias</HI> PYNSON, is the fir&s;t known Printer in the city of <HI>London,</HI> no edition having been hitherto di&s;|cover'd, except that anonymous one mention'd above, of older date than his dialogue of <HI>Dives</HI> and <HI>Pauper</HI> in 1493. Be&s;ides, as we have about 15 editions of his that are without date, we may more rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e that they were printed before than after this year, in which he began to put a date. He was brought up under Mr. <HI>Caxton,</HI> as well as <HI>Winken de Worde,</HI> and being become a thorough ma&s;ter of the art, went and &s;et up a Pre&s;s of his own at <HI>Temple-bar,</HI> as the in&s;cription of his fir&s;t edition &s;hews. The friend&s;hip which he had contracted with <HI>De Worde,</HI> whil&s;t the&s;e two wrought under <HI>Caxton,</HI> was &s;o far from being di&s;turb'd by any mutual emulation or rival&s;hip, that it continued to their death; and it is thought that after their ma&s;ter's death, <HI>Pyn&s;on</HI> prevail'd upon him to leave <HI>Westminster,</HI> and to come and &s;ettle nearer to him, which he accordingly did. What makes this more than pro|bable is, that the la&s;t edition of <HI>Caxton</HI> is dated, as we have &s;hewn, <HI>anno</HI> 1502, and the fir&s;t that <HI>De Worde</HI> printed in <HI>London,</HI> as far as we have been able to di&s;cover, is dated 1503. The&s;e two were joined in
<PB N="354" REF="367">
the Printing of the king's year-books, as long as <HI>De Worde</HI> lived, which were afterwards continued by <HI>Pin&s;on;</HI> and this is a &s;ufficient te&s;timony of his having been an excellent Printer, were there nothing el&s;e to a&s;&s;ure us of it: for it is not to be &s;uppos'd that he would have a&s;&s;ociated him|&s;elf to any other. <HI>Pyn&s;on</HI> &s;tiles him&s;elf Printer to the king in &s;ome of his editions, probably from a grant he had for the printing of tho&s;e year-books above mention'd. For we neither find that he printed any bibles, or other books, for which patents were granted by the crown. I don't find that he u&s;ed any rebus, but he either printed his name at length, or el&s;e only the two initial letters R. P. The li&s;t of his works is nothing &s;o copious as tho&s;e of his a&s;&s;ociate, tho' he conti|nued Printing at lea&s;t 34 years, as appears from the dates of his fir&s;t and la&s;t edition, which makes me conclude that a great part of them are lo&s;t.

<HEAD>XV. RICHARD GRAFTON. MDXXXIX.</HEAD>
<P>RICHARD GRAFTON, Citizen of <HI>London,</HI> from an indifferent Au|thor and Hi&s;torian, became a famous and eminent Printer. Among other of his works under the former character, we have his Abridge|ment of the Chronicle of <HI>England,</HI> in which he is a con&s;tant borrower from the bulkier work of <HI>Edward Hall</HI> Recorder of <HI>London,</HI> who wrote the Hi&s;tory of the Wars between the Hou&s;es of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> wherein the Reader will find little worth notice, if we may believe Dr. <HI>Nichol&s;on,</HI> than the fa&s;hions and changes of Dre&s;s in each King's Reign. As <HI>Grafton</HI> was not over judicious in the choice of this Author, &s;o nei|ther was he in the compiling of his Abridgement; in &s;o much that the learned <HI>Buchanan,</HI> in his Hi&s;tory of <HI>Scotland,</HI> doth not &s;cruple to call him <HI>a very headle&s;s and unskilful Writer,</HI> tho' he has had the honour of being quoted by <HI>Stow,</HI> and other Hi&s;torians.</P>
<P>THE occa&s;ion of his turning Printer was his being pitch'd upon to procure an Edition of <HI>William Tyndal,</HI> alias <HI>Hickins</HI> Ver&s;ion of the New Te&s;tament, and afterwards of his Bible revi&s;ed and corrected by <HI>Myles Coverdal,</HI> a learned <HI>Franci&s;can</HI> Fryar, well learned in the <HI>Hebrew, Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> tongues. Some impre&s;&s;ions of the former had already been di&s;per&s;ed about <HI>England</HI> and el&s;ewhere, but were bought up by <HI>Tonstal</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> and Sir <HI>Thomas More,</HI> and been burnt at St. <HI>Paul's Cro&s;s;</HI> and it was very dangerous to undertake the reprinting of &s;uch a work in <HI>London</HI> upon that account. This made <HI>Grafton</HI> and his a&s;&s;o|ciate <HI>Edward Whitchurch</HI> re&s;olve to get it done at <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> whither they likewi&s;e &s;ent <HI>Coverdal</HI> to correct the Pre&s;s. This proved a very expen&s;ive work, and the impre&s;&s;ion of the Bible alone co&s;t them <HI>500l.</HI> a great &s;um in tho&s;e days. When it was brought over into <HI>England,</HI> it met with great oppo&s;ition from the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Prie&s;ts, they having &s;ome time before obtain'd a Royal Proclamation, to prohibit and aboli&s;h that among other heretical books; and, had not <HI>Bonner</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>He|reford</HI> bought up the greate&s;t part of the Copies in order to de&s;troy them, the undertakers mu&s;t have been infallibly ruin'd. This Edition is &s;uppos'd to have been printed <HI>anno</HI> 1535.</P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="383">
HIS New Te&s;tament met with wor&s;e fate, of which we have an authentick te&s;timony extant in the Library of the Honourable Earl of <HI>Pembroke, viz.</HI> two Editions of it printed at <HI>Antwerp</HI> in the &s;ame year, <HI>viz. anno</HI> 1434, one of which has a Preface prefix'd to it, to ju&s;tify that Edition, from the other of the &s;ame year printed under his name, but &s;trangely mutilated and mi&s;printed. A more particular account of which is given in the Introduction to <HI>Wickliff</HI>'s Bible lately publi&s;h'd.</P>
<P>FINDING that a ver&s;ion of the Bible was as much de&s;ir'd by the fa|vourers of the Reformation, as it was cry'd down by the enemies of it, they ventur'd to print a &s;econd edition of it under the patronage of Archbi&s;hop <HI>Cranmer</HI> and the Lord <HI>Cromwell.</HI> But <HI>Tyndal</HI> having been by that time burnt as a heretick in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and his name growing then &s;omewhat ignominious, they thought fit to publi&s;h it under the name of <HI>Matthews</HI>'s Bible, tho' <HI>Tyndal</HI> is affirm'd to have fini&s;h'd all but the <HI>Apocrypha</HI> as &s;ome, or as far as <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> as others affirm. <HI>Grafton</HI> having fini&s;h'd the printing of it pre&s;ented it to his two great Patrons, by whom, at his reque&s;t, it was likewi&s;e pre&s;ented to the King to whom it was dedicated. It had the&s;e words in red letters printed at the bottom of the title-page <HI>&s;et forth with the King's mo&s;t gracious licence.</HI> But, as they were &s;u&s;pected to have been foi&s;ted in, <HI>Grafton</HI> obtain'd leave to have it further licen&s;ed under the privy &s;eal. Soon after this it being ob&s;erved how acceptable an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bible was to the people, &s;ome per&s;ons form'd a de&s;ign to print it in a &s;maller volume, in order to un|der&s;ell <HI>Grafton</HI>'s, which obliged him to apply to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and to obtain a patent from the King, that none &s;hould print it for three years; and for the better &s;ale of this, that noble man did likewi&s;e procure him an order that every Curate of a pari&s;h &s;hould be obliged to have one, and every Abby &s;ix of them; &s;o that this &s;econd impre&s;&s;ion, wherever print|ed, was very &s;oon bought up.</P>
<P>GRAFTON and his partners in the work ob&s;erving that there was &s;till a call for them, re&s;olved to reprint it a third time, and in a larger vo|lume, but without the&s;e notes and prologues which they ob&s;erv'd had given &s;ome offence. <HI>Paris</HI> was the place pitch'd upon to print it at, and <HI>Cromwell,</HI> who favour'd the enterprize, procured letters from King <HI>Henry</HI> to the <HI>French</HI> King, <HI>to permit a &s;ubject of his to print the</HI> Engli&s;h
<PB N="371" REF="384">
<HI>Bible in the univer&s;ity of</HI> Paris, <HI>becau&s;e of the goodne&s;s of the</HI> French <HI>paper and workmen. Bonner,</HI> then Amba&s;&s;ador from <HI>England</HI> to the Court, had likewi&s;e orders <HI>to a&s;&s;ist the undertakers of that good work in all rea|&s;onable &s;uits. Bonner</HI> obtain'd not only the de&s;ir'd licence, but likewi&s;e letters patents for printing this Bible, and for conveying it &s;afe over to <HI>England.</HI> This edition, being thus encourag'd, went bri&s;kly on to the end; but <HI>Bonner,</HI> who never liked the work, and did only promote it to make his court to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> found means to ob&s;truct it privately, notwith&s;tanding the King's patents.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, <HI>anno</HI> 1438, the Printers were taken up, and charged with here&s;y, by order of the Faculty, and <HI>Coverdale</HI> the corrector, <HI>Grafton</HI> the Head Printer, and other <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> who contributed to the charges of the impre&s;&s;ion, were &s;ent for; but they fore&s;eeing the con|&s;equences, fled away as fa&s;t as they could, and left the whole impre&s;&s;ion which was ju&s;t fini&s;h'd, and con&s;i&s;ted of 2500 Copies, behind them. This was immediately &s;eiz'd by the Lieutenant Criminal, and order'd to be burnt, except &s;ome few which he &s;old, through covetou&s;ne&s;s, for wa&s;te-paper, which were afterwards bought up again, being about four fats or che&s;ts full.</P>
<P>MY Lord <HI>Pembroke</HI> favour'd me with the &s;ight of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bible printed in <HI>Gothic</HI> characters, <HI>an.</HI> 1537. without place or Printer's name, with the&s;e words at the end;</P>

<P>&para; To the Honoure and Pray&s;e of Gode was this Byble prynted and fyne&s;hed in the yere of oure Lorde Gode. a M D XXXVII.</P>
<P>BUT whether this is one of them that were printed at <HI>Paris,</HI> or one of the former edition I cannot determine; but it is more probable to be the latter, becau&s;e it has a Concordance of the mo&s;t remarkable texts of Scripture again&s;t the errors of Popery: whereas, as I ob&s;erv'd be|fore, they had &s;uppre&s;s'd mo&s;t things of that nature in the <HI>Paris</HI> one. But let this be of what edition it will, it is very probable that the Con|cordance proved the cau&s;e of the almo&s;t total de&s;truction of it, in &s;o much that I que&s;tion whether there be any other copy of it left except this above mention'd. However, <HI>Grafton</HI> and his a&s;&s;ociates, by <HI>Crom|well</HI>'s

<HEAD>AN APPENDIX To the GENERAL HISTORY of PRINTING of BOOKS: BEING AN ADDITIONAL HISTORY OF THE RISE and PROGRESS of <HI>PRINTS,</HI> Which are Incus'd.</HEAD>
<P>Exactly copy'd from the R. H. the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI>'s curious Book of tho&s;e PRINTS, in which each Piece hath its own particular account of its manner, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in Manu&s;cript, in a right progre&s;&s;ive order, as follows.</P>
<P N="1">1. ANTONIO POLLAIOLOLO nat. 1426. ob. 1498. <HI>Bal|dinucci</HI> &s;ays that he engraved the Battle at <HI>Florence</HI> about 1460, and that <HI>Andrea Montegna</HI> graved his Triumph at <HI>Rome</HI> &s;oon after his being there. They both graved upon Pewter. The former printed his name on it thus, <HI>Opus Antonij Pollaiololo Florentini.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>I&s;rael van Meckenem</HI> his own Effigies.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="391" REF="404">
3. This <HI>I&s;rael van Meckenem</HI> is by &s;ome authors called <HI>Van Mecklin</HI> &amp; <HI>Mentz</HI> &amp; <HI>Moguntin. Lomazero</HI> &s;ays he was the fir&s;t that engraved; he was Ma&s;ter to <HI>Bon Martino,</HI> who was Ma&s;ter to <HI>Albert Durer,</HI> who&s;e fir&s;t Print was a Copy after this of <HI>I&s;rael</HI>'s <HI>an.</HI> 1497. and as <HI>Baldinucci</HI> &s;ays <HI>I&s;rael</HI> did not engrave till he had &s;een the Triumph of <HI>Ant. Mon|tegno, anno</HI> 1467, which is the olde&s;t date that any author has men|tion'd, and the termination being <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> &s;hows that the art &s;pread very &s;oon.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>A. M.</HI> was, as is &s;uppo&s;ed, <HI>Andrea de Murano</HI> 1412. This Print is upon that mixt metal on which Gold&s;miths u&s;ed to engrave their fir&s;t proofs. It is now likewi&s;e u&s;ed by other arti&s;ts. Founders call it the hard metal, and Printers the Type-metal, tho' the latter has a greater proportion of Iron. The other materials are Lead, Block-tin, and Regulus of Antimony. <HI>Albert Durer</HI> began by copying of old Prints, as you will &s;ee when you come to him; this Print is older than that of 1467, which &s;tands by it, which was taken to be the olde&s;t of any one with a date by the author, who mentions this for want of knowing of that. As for the year 1412 above mention'd it agrees with the time in which <HI>A. de Murano</HI> flouri&s;h'd; and <HI>Baldinucci</HI> &s;peaks in one place as if other authors were uncertain how near 1400 the invention of Prints was. Yet he &s;eems to &s;ay that <HI>Ma&s;o Finiguerri</HI> was not long before <HI>Pollaiololo,</HI> who follow'd <HI>Baccio Baldini,</HI> who imitated <HI>Ma&s;o</HI> the inventor of Prints, by taking off &s;ome from engraved &s;ilver work to &s;ee the impre&s;&s;ion: but, unle&s;s he did &s;o &s;ome years before, this Print mu&s;t be older.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Andrea Montegna</HI> N. 1431. <HI>an.</HI> 1517. The next after <HI>Pollaiololo</HI> who engraved in <HI>Italy.</HI> His be&s;t works were after the Antique. But this fir&s;t is none of the nine which he compo&s;ed from the Antiques.</P>
<P N="6">6. The &s;ixth in order of his painting. This is his original Print; they have &s;ince fini&s;hed (within the&s;e outlines) the Prints that are commonly &s;old for it.</P>

8. <HI>Mich. Angelo</HI> on &s;ilk. This is only from a drawing, the painting of which has much more in it, and is to be &s;een in my Lord's Gallery. This is the fir&s;t Print that is not upon Paper.</P>
<P N="9">9. The <HI>Suavius</HI> was the fir&s;t Print done on two Copper-plates. This Print, be&s;ides the blue ground, has the figure of old <HI>Time</HI> clipping <HI>Cu|pid</HI>'s wings.

<P N="15">15. This manner, which was invented in <HI>Germany,</HI> differs from all Prints, becau&s;e the ink ri&s;es upon the paper.</P>

<P N="17">17. Four Mezotinto's varying from the common manner of tho&s;e Prints. In this the figure (our Saviour on the Cro&s;s) is engraved, the re&s;t is done in Mezotinto, the other three are each in a different colour.</P>
<P N="18">18. Mr. <HI>Tayler</HI> a Painter, who improved the printing of Stuffs in <HI>Holland,</HI> he invented this Art of printing in colours; and Mr. <HI>Le Blond</HI> (though he might take the hint from this) has further improved it by printing his pieces &s;o as to look like painting; the fir&s;t that he did in this kind was after the <HI>Baroccio</HI> in my Lord <HI>Pembroke</HI>'s gallery.</P>

<P><HI>Albert Durer nat.</HI> 1470, <HI>ob.</HI> 1528, was famous for cutting on Wood, and all other manners of ingraving, as may be &s;een by the&s;e four that follow, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P N="24">24. This bears the olde&s;t date of all his, whether on Wood or Copper. This is al&s;o dated 1502, but the mark differs from his u&s;ual mark.</P>
<P N="25">25. If <HI>Hugo Carpi</HI> was the inventor of Printing upon three planches, he mu&s;t have been very young; for he was but 18 years old when <HI>A.

<P N="34">34. The la&s;t piece that <HI>Durer</HI> engrav'd. It is the head of <HI>Era&s;mus,</HI> and is dated 1526.</P>
<P N="35">35. A Crucifix engraved on a golden head of the Emperor's Cane. It was &s;old for 150 Gilders, and is the only Print taken from Gold; that of <HI>An.

<P N="36">36. The famous Bag-piper by <HI>Lucas van Leyden.</HI> This is the Ori|ginal, which was &s;old for 60 Duccatoons. The Copy, which &s;tands next to it, is pretty &s;carce. The&s;e two, and that on the gold cane, were on one Cartoon in the <HI>Arundel</HI> Collection.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.

Explicit Liber quartus</P>
<P>Dialogorum Gregorii.</P>
<P>Finding in this Book of My Lord's, that what was in Red was Printed, made me Print what I have &s;ay'd of it; but my Lord, not approving of it, I promi&s;ed to Print at the end of the Erra|ta what his Lord&s;hip had writ at the beginning of his Book, as follows:</P>
<P>I bought this Book, becau&s;e it is Printed before they made u&s;e of Matrices to ca&s;t &s;ingle Letters. From the variation of the Shapes of the &s;ame Letters, it appears to be Wooden Movable Types: As for the Red I told the man, that I believ'd there was &s;ome Cheat in it, becau&s;e I had &s;ome Months before &s;uch a Book, printed without the Red, brought to me by an other Per&s;on, who ask'd me more for it then I car'd to give. The Paper has the Bull's Head, on which <HI>Fau&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. printed, and is reckon'd to be older than any dated by <HI>Fau&s;t,</HI> and &s;o older than the Date here in Red.</P>
