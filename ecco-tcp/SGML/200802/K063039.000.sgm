<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IT needs the mo&s;t humble apology from the Com|piler of this little Interlude, for the liberties he has taken with a Poem &s;o univer&s;ally, and ju&s;tly admired. The different prunings which he judged nece&s;&s;ary for his purpo&s;e, were as &s;en&s;ibly lamented by the hand that performed them, as they can po&s;&s;ibly be by the mo&s;t zealous advocate for the ingenious PRIOR. The&s;e however, with various other alterations, far from being the re&s;ult of &s;elf-con&s;equence, aro&s;e from ab|&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, in order to give the whole an ap|pearance, &s;omewhat conformable to the laws of our drama. It was therefore found expedient likewi&s;e to introduce the two new, though trifling characters of VENUS and EUGENIUS; and to conclude the whole with an AIR and CHORUS, which are here tacked to the piece, with every conviction in the brea&s;t of the author for his pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>A tran&s;po&s;ition of &s;ome lines, an occa&s;ional addition of others, &s;ome variation of the per&s;onal pronouns, &amp;c. were judged proper to accommodate the performers, and prepare the piece for &s;tage repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e circum&s;tances it is hoped that this temporary &s;acrifice of PRIOR will be candidly overlooked by the Public, &s;ince it was made but to a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;ome mea&s;ure the mode&s;t merit of MRS. HARTLEY, and to gratify no other de&s;ire in the COMPILER.</P>
