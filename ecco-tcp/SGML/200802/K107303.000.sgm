<HEAD>The BEE. NUMBER I. <DATE>SATURDAY, <HI>October</HI> 6, 1759.</DATE></HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>_THERE is not, perhaps, a more whim&s;ically di&s;mal figure in na|ture, than a man of real mode&s;ty who a&s;&s;umes an air of impudence; who, while his heart beats with anxiety, &s;tudies ea&s;e, and affects good humour. In this &s;ituation, however, a periodical writer often finds him&s;elf, upon his fir&s;t attempt to addre&s;s the public in form. All his power of plea&s;ing is damped by &s;olicitude, and his chear|fulne&s;s da&s;hed with apprehen&s;ion. Impre&s;&s;ed with the terrors of the tribunal before which he is going to appear, his natural humour turns to pert|ne&s;s,
<PB N="2" REF="5">
and for real wit he is obliged to &s;ub&s;titute vi|vacity. His fir&s;t publication draws a crowd, they part di&s;&s;atisfied, and the author, never more to be indulged a favourable hearing, is left to con|demn the indelicacy of his own addre&s;s, or their want of di&s;cernment.</P>
<P>For my part, as I was never di&s;tingui&s;hed for ad|dre&s;s, and have often even blundered in making my bow, &s;uch bodings as the&s;e had like to have totally repre&s;&s;ed my ambition. I was at a lo&s;s whether to give the public &s;pecious promi&s;es, or give none; whether to be merry or &s;ad on this &s;olemn occa&s;ion. If I &s;hould mode&s;tly decline all merit, it was too probable the ha&s;ty reader might have taken me at my word. If, on the other hand, like labourers in the Magazine trade, I had, with mode&s;t impudence, humbly pre&s;umed to promi&s;e an epitome of all the good things that ever were &s;aid or written, this might have di&s;gu&s;ted tho&s;e readers I mo&s;t de&s;ire to plea&s;e. Had I been merry, I might have been cen&s;ured as <HI>va&s;tly low</HI>; and had I been &s;orrowful, I might have been left to mourn in &s;olitude and &s;ilence: In &s;hort, which ever way I turned, nothing pre&s;ented but pro&s;pects of terror, de&s;pair, chandlers &s;hops, and wa&s;te paper.</P>
<P>In this debate between fear and ambition, my publi&s;her happening to arrive, interrupted for a
<PB N="3" REF="6">
while my anxiety. Perceiving my embarra&s;ment about making my fir&s;t appearance, he in&s;tantly offered his a&s;&s;i&s;tance and advice: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You mu&s;t know, &s;ir, &s;ays he, that the republic of letters is at pre&s;ent divided into three cla&s;&s;es. One writer, for in&s;tance, excels at a plan, or a title-page, another works away the body of the book, and a third is a dab at an index. Thus a Magazine is not the re&s;ult of any &s;ingle man's indu&s;try; but goes through as many hands as a new pin, before it is fit for the public. I fancy, &s;ir, continues he, I can provide an eminent hand, and upon moderate terms, to draw up a promi&s;ing plan to &s;mooth up our readers a little, and pay them, as colonel Charteris paid his &s;e|raglio, at the rate of three halfpence in hand, and three &s;hillings more in promi&s;es."</Q></P>
<P>He was proceeding in his advice, which, how|ever, I thought proper to decline, by a&s;&s;uring him, that as I intended to pur&s;ue no fixed method, &s;o it was impo&s;&s;ible to form any regular plan; deter|mined never to be tedious, in order to be logical, wherever plea&s;ure pre&s;ented, I was re&s;olved to follow. Like the BEE, which I had taken for the title of my paper, I would rove from flower to flower, with &s;eeming inattention, but concealed choice, expatiate over all the beauties of the &s;ea&s;on, and make my indu&s;try my amu&s;ement.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="7">This reply may al&s;o &s;erve as an apology to the reader, who expects, before he fits down, a bill of his future entertainment. It would be improper to pall his curio&s;ity by le&s;&s;ening his &s;urprize, or anticipate any plea&s;ure I am able to procure him, by &s;aying what &s;hall come next. Thus much, however, he may be a&s;&s;ured of, that neither war nor &s;candal &s;hall make any part of it. Homer finely imagines his deity turning away with horror from the pro&s;pect of a field of battle, and &s;eeking tranquility among a nation noted for peace and &s;implicity. Happy could any effort of mine, but for a moment, repre&s;s that &s;avage plea&s;ure &s;ome men find in the daily accounts of human mi&s;ery! How gladly would I lead them from &s;cenes of blood and altercation, to pro&s;pects of innocence and ea&s;e, where every breeze breaths health, and every found is but the echo of tranquility.</P>
<P>But whatever the merit of his intentions may be, every writer is now convinced that he mu&s;t be chiefly indebted to good fortune for finding readers willing to allow him any degree of reputation. It has been remarked, that almo&s;t every character which has excited either attention or prai&s;e, has owed part of its &s;ucce&s;s to merit, and part to an happy concurrence of circum&s;tances in its favour. Had Cae&s;ar or Cromwell exchanged countries, the one might have been a &s;erjeant, and the other an exci&s;eman. So it is with wit, which generally
<PB N="5" REF="8">
&s;ucceeds more from being happily addre&s;&s;ed, than from its native poignancy. A <HI>bon mot,</HI> for in|&s;tance, that might be reli&s;hed at White's, may lo&s;e all its flavour when delivered at the Cat and bag|pipes in St. Giles's. A je&s;t calculated to &s;pread at a gaming-table, may be received with a perfect neutrality of face &s;hould it happen to drop in a mackrel-boat. We have all &s;een dunces triumph in &s;ome companies, where men of real humour were di&s;regarded, by a general combination in fa|vour of &s;tupidity. To drive the ob&s;ervation as far as it will go, &s;hould the labours of a writer who de&s;igns his performances for readers of a more refined appetite fall into the hands of a devourer of compilations, what can he expect but con|tempt and confu&s;ion. If his merits are to be de|termined by judges who e&s;timate the value of a book from its bulk, or its fronti&s;piece, every rival mu&s;t acquire an ea&s;y &s;uperiority, who with per|&s;ua&s;ive eloquence promi&s;es four extraordinary pages of <HI>letter pre&s;s,</HI> or three beautiful prints, cu|riou&s;ly coloured from nature.</P>
<P>But to proceed; though I cannot promi&s;e as much entertainment, or as much elegance as others have done, yet the reader may be a&s;&s;ured he &s;hall have as much of both as I can. He &s;hall, at lea&s;t, find me alive while I &s;tudy his entertain|ment; for I &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ure him, I was never yet
<PB N="6" REF="9">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ecret at once of writing and &s;leeping.</P>
<P>During the cour&s;e of this paper, therefore, all the wit and learning I have, are heartily at his &s;ervice; which if, after &s;o candid a confe&s;&s;ion he &s;hould, notwith&s;tanding, &s;till find intolerably dull, low, or &s;ad &s;tuff, this I prote&s;t is more than I know. I have a clear con&s;cience, and am entirely out of the &s;ecret.</P>
<P>Yet I would not have him, upon the peru&s;al of a &s;ingle paper, pronounce me incorrigible; he may try a &s;econd, which, as there is a &s;tudied difference in &s;ubject and &s;tyle, may be more &s;uited to his ta&s;te; if this al&s;o fails, I mu&s;t refer him to a third, or even to a fourth, in ca&s;e of extremity: If he &s;hould &s;till continue refractory, and find me dull to the la&s;t, I mu&s;t inform him, with Bays in the Rehear&s;al, that I think him a very odd kind of a fellow, and de&s;ire no more of his acquain|tance.</P>
<P>It is with &s;uch reflections as the&s;e I endeavour to fortify my&s;elf again&s;t the future contempt or neglect of &s;ome readers, and am prepared for their di&s;like by mutual recrimination. If &s;uch &s;hould impute dealing neither in battles nor &s;candal to me as a fault, in&s;tead of acquie&s;cing in their cen&s;ure, I mu&s;t beg leave to tell them a &s;tory.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="10">A traveller, in his way to Italy, happening to pa&s;s at the foot of the Alps, found him&s;elf at la&s;t in a country where the inhabitants had each a large excre&s;cence depending from the chin, like the pouch of a monkey. This deformity, as it was endemic, and the people little u&s;ed to &s;trangers, it had been the cu&s;tom, time im|memorial, to look upon as the greate&s;t ornament of the human vi&s;age. Ladies grew toa&s;ts from the &s;ize of their chins, and none were regarded as pretty fellows, but &s;uch who&s;e faces were broade&s;t at the bottom. It was Sunday, a coun|try church was at hand, and our traveller was willing to perform the duties of the day. Upon his fir&s;t appearance at the church door, the eyes of all were naturally fixed upon the &s;tranger; but what was their amazement, when they found that he actually wanted that emblem of beauty, a pur&s;ed chin. This was a defect that not a &s;ingle crea|ture had &s;ufficient gravity (though they were noted for being grave) to with&s;tand. Stifled bur&s;ts of laughter, winks, and whi&s;pers circulated from vi&s;age to vi&s;age, and the pri&s;matic figure of the &s;tranger's face was a fund of infinite gaiety; even the par&s;on, equally remarkable for his gravity and chin, could hardly refrain joining in the good hu|mour. Our traveller could no longer patiently con|tinue an object for deformity to point at. Good folks, &s;aid he, I perceive that I am the unfortunate cau&s;e of all this good humour. It is true, I may
<PB N="8" REF="11">
have faults in abundance, but I &s;hall never be in|duced to reckon my want of a &s;welled face among the number.</P>

<PB N="9" REF="12">
<HEAD>REMARKS ON OUR THEATRES.</HEAD>
<P>OUR theatres are now opened, and all Grub|&s;treet is preparing its advice to the mana|gers; we &s;hall undoubtedly hear learned di&s;qui|&s;itions on the &s;tructure of one actor's legs, and another's eye-brows. We &s;hall be told much of enunciations, tones and attitudes, and &s;hall have our lighte&s;t plea&s;ures commented upon by didactic dullne&s;s. We &s;hall, it is feared, be told, that Garrick is a fine actor, but then, as a manager, &s;o avaricious! That Palmer is a mo&s;t promi&s;ing genius, and Holland likely to do well, in a par|ticular ca&s;t of character. We &s;hall have them giving Shuter in&s;tructions to amu&s;e us by rule, and deploring over the ruins of de&s;olated Maje&s;ty in Covent-Garden. As I love to be advi&s;ing too, for advice is ea&s;ily given, and bears a &s;hew of wi&s;+dom and &s;uperiority, I mu&s;t be permitted to offer a few ob&s;ervations upon our theatres and actors, without, on this trivial occa&s;ion, throwing my thoughts into the formality of method.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="13">There is &s;omething in the deportment of all our players infinitely more &s;tiff and formal than among the actors of other nations. Their action &s;its unea&s;y upon them; for as the Engli&s;h u&s;e very little ge&s;ture in ordinary conver&s;ation, our Engli&s;h-bred actors are obliged to &s;upply &s;tage ge&s;tures by their imagination alone. A French comedian finds proper models of action in every company and in every coffee-hou&s;e he enters. An Engli&s;h|man is obliged to take his models from the &s;tage it&s;elf; he is obliged to imitate nature from an imitation of nature. I know of no &s;et of men more likely to be improved by travelling than tho&s;e of the theatrical profe&s;&s;ion. The inhabitants of the continent are le&s;s re&s;erved than here; they may be &s;een through upon a fir&s;t acquaintance; &s;uch are the proper models to draw from; they are at once &s;triking, and are found in great abun|dance.</P>
<P>Though it would be inexcu&s;able in a comedian to add any thing of his own to the Poet's dialogue, yet as to action he is entirely at liberty. By this he may &s;hew the fertility of his genius, the poig|nancy of his humour, and the exactne&s;s of his judgment; we &s;carce &s;ee a coxcomb or a fool in common life, that has not &s;ome peculiar oddity in his action. The&s;e peculiarities it is not in the power of words to repre&s;ent, and depend &s;olely upon the actor. They give a reli&s;h to the humour
<PB N="11" REF="14">
of the poet, and make the appearance of nature more illu&s;ive; the Italians, it is true, ma&s;k &s;ome characters, and endeavour to pre&s;erve the peculiar humour by the make of the ma&s;k; but I have &s;een others &s;till pre&s;erve a great fund of humour in the face without a ma&s;k; one actor, particu|larly, by a &s;quint which he threw into &s;ome characters of low life, a&s;&s;umed a book of infinite &s;olidity. This, though upon reflection we might condemn, yet, immediately, upon repre&s;entation, we could not avoid being plea&s;ed with. To il|lu&s;trate what I have been &s;aying by the plays I have of late gone to &s;ee: In the Mi&s;er which was played a few nights ago at Covent-Garden, Love-gold appears through the whole in circum&s;tances of exaggerated avarice; all the player's action, therefore, &s;hould con&s;pire with the poet's de&s;ign, and repre&s;ent him as an epitome of penury. The French comedian, in this character, in the mid&s;t of one of his mo&s;t violent pa&s;&s;ions, while he ap|pears in an ungovernable rage, feels the demon of avarice &s;till upon him, and &s;toops down to pick up a pin, which he quilts into the flap of his coat-pocket with great a&s;&s;iduity. Two candles are lighted up for his wedding; he flies, and turns one of them into the &s;ocket; it is, however, lighted up again; he then &s;teals to it, and privately crams it into his pocket. The Mock-Doctor was lately played at the other hou&s;e. Here again the come|dian had an opportunity of heightening the ridi|cule
<PB N="12" REF="15">
by action. The French player &s;its in a chair with an high back, and then begins to &s;hew away by talking non&s;en&s;e, which he would have thought latin by tho&s;e whom he knows do not under|&s;tand a &s;yllable of the matter. At la&s;t he grows enthu&s;ia&s;tic, enjoys the admiration of the company, to&s;&s;es his legs and arms about, and in the mid&s;t of his raptures and vociferation, he and the chair fall back together. All this appears dull enough in the recital, but the gravity of Cato could not &s;tand it in the repre&s;entation. In &s;hort, there is hardly a character in comedy to which a player of any real humour, might not add &s;trokes of vivacity that could not fail of applau&s;e. But in&s;tead of this we too often &s;ee our fine gentlemen do nothing through a whole part, but &s;trut, and open their &s;nuff-box; our pretty fellows &s;it indecently with their legs acro&s;s, and our clowns pull up their breeches. The&s;e, if once, or even twice repeated, might do well enough; but to &s;ee them &s;erved up in every &s;cene, argues the actor almo&s;t as barren as the character he would expo&s;e.</P>
<P>The magnificence of our theatres is far &s;uperior to any others in Europe where plays only are acted. The great care our performers take in painting for a part, their exactne&s;s in all the minutiae of dre&s;s, and other little &s;cenical pro|prieties, have been taken notice of by Ricoboni, a gentleman of Italy, who travelled Europe with
<PB N="13" REF="16">
no other de&s;ign but to remark upon the &s;tage; but there are &s;everal apparent improprieties &s;till con|tinued, or lately come into fa&s;hion. As, for in|&s;tance, &s;preading a carpet punctually at the be|ginning of the death &s;cene, in order to prevent our actors from &s;poiling their cloaths; this imme|diately apprizes us of the tragedy to follow; for laying the cloth is not a more &s;ure indication of dinner than laying the carpet of bloody work at Drury-Lane. Our little pages al&s;o with unmean|ing faces, that bear up the train of a weeping prince&s;s, and our aukward lords in waiting, take off much from her di&s;tre&s;s. Mutes of every kind divide our attention, and le&s;&s;en our &s;en&s;ibility; but here it is entirely ridiculous, as we &s;ee them &s;eriou&s;ly employed in doing nothing. If we mu&s;t have dirty-&s;hirted guards upon the theatres, they &s;hould be taught to keep their eyes fixed on the actors, and not roll them round upon the au|dience, as if they were ogling the boxes.</P>
<P>Beauty methinks &s;eems a requi&s;ite qualification in an actre&s;s. This &s;eems &s;crupulou&s;ly ob&s;erved el&s;ewhere, and for my part I could wi&s;h to &s;ee it ob&s;erved at home. I can never conceive an hero dying for love of a lady totally de&s;titute of beuaty. I mu&s;t think the part unnatural, for I cannot bear to hear him call that face angelic, when even paint cannot hide its wrinkles. I mu&s;t condemn him of &s;tupidity, and the per&s;on whom
<PB N="14" REF="17">
I can accu&s;e for want of ta&s;te will &s;eldom become the object of my affections or admiration. But if this be a defect, what mu&s;t be the entire perver&s;ion of &s;cenical decorum, when for in&s;tance we &s;ee an actre&s;s that might act the Wapping Landlady without a bol&s;ter, pining in the character of Jane Shore, and while unwieldy with fat endeavouring to convince the audience that &s;he is dying with hunger.</P>
<P>For the future then, I could wi&s;h that the parts of the young or beautiful were given to performers of &s;uitable figures; for I mu&s;t own, I could rather &s;ee the &s;tage filled with agreeable objects, though they might &s;ome times bungle a little, than &s;ee it crowded with withered or mi&s;hapen figures, be their empha&s;is, as I think it is called, ever &s;o proper. The fir&s;t may have the awkward appear|ance of new-rai&s;ed troops, but in viewing the la&s;t, I cannot avoid the mortification of fancying my&s;elf placed in an ho&s;pital of invalids.</P>

The em|perors and the generals, who in the&s;e periods of approaching ignorance, &s;till felt a pa&s;&s;ion for &s;cience, from time to time, added to its buildings, or encrea&s;ed its profe&s;&s;or&s;hips. Theodoric, the O&s;trogoth, was of the number; he repaired tho&s;e &s;chools which barbarity was &s;uffering to fall into decay, and continued tho&s;e pen&s;ions to men of learning, which avaricious governors had mono|polized to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>In this city, and about this period, Alcander and Septimius were fellow &s;tudents together. The
<PB N="16" REF="19">
one the mo&s;t &s;ubtle rea&s;oner of all the Lyceum; the other the mo&s;t eloquent &s;peaker in the acade|mic grove. Mutual admiration &s;oon begot an acquaintance, and a &s;imilitude of di&s;po&s;ition made them perfect friends. Their fortunes were nearly equal, their &s;tudies the &s;ame, and they were natives of the two mo&s;t celebrated cities in the world; for Alcander was of Athens, Septimius came from Rome.</P>
<P>In this mutual harmony they lived for &s;ome time together, when Alcander, after pa&s;&s;ing the fir&s;t part of his youth in the indolence of philo|&s;ophy, thought at length of entering into the bu&s;y world, and as a &s;tep previous to this, placed his affections on Hypatia, a lady of exqui&s;ite beauty. Hypatia &s;hewed no di&s;like to his addre&s;&s;es: The day of their intended nuptials was fixed, the previous ceremonies were performed, and nothing now remained but her being conducted in tri|umph to the apartment of the intended bride|groom.</P>
<P>An exultation in his own happine&s;s, or his being unable to enjoy any &s;atisfaction without making his friend Septimius a partner, prevailed upon him to introduce his mi&s;tre&s;s to his fellow &s;tudent, which he did with all the gaiety of a man who found him&s;elf equally happy in friend&s;hip and love. But this was an interview fatal to
<PB N="17" REF="20">
the future peace of both. Septimius no &s;ooner &s;aw her, but he was &s;mit with an involuntary pa&s;&s;ion. He u&s;ed every effort, but in vain, to &s;uppre&s;s de&s;ires at once &s;o imprudent and unju&s;t. He retired to his apartment in inexpre&s;&s;ible agony; and the emotions of his mind in a &s;hort time became &s;o &s;trong, that they brought on a fever, which the phy&s;icians judged incurable.</P>
<P>During this illne&s;s, Alcander watched him with all the anxiety of fondne&s;s, and brought his mi&s;tre&s;s to join in tho&s;e amiable offices of friend|&s;hip. The &s;agacity of the phy&s;icians, by this means &s;oon di&s;covered the cau&s;e of their patient's di&s;order; and Alcander being apprized of their di&s;covery, at length extorted a confe&s;&s;ion from the reluctant dying lover.</P>
<P>It would but delay the narrative to de&s;cribe the conflict between love and friend&s;hip in the brea&s;t of Alcander on this occa&s;ion; it is enough to &s;ay, that the Athenians were at this time ar|rived to &s;uch refinement in morals, that every virtue was carried to exce&s;s. In &s;hort, forgetful of his own felicity, he gave up his intended bride, in all her charms, to the young Roman. They were married privately by his connivance, and this un|looked-for change of fortune wrought as unex|pected a change in the con&s;titution of the now happy Septimius. In a few days he was perfectly
<PB N="18" REF="21">
recovered, and &s;et out with his fair partner for Rome. Here, by an exertion of tho&s;e talents which he was &s;o eminently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, he in a few years arrived at the highe&s;t dignities of the &s;tate, and was con&s;tituted the city judge, or praetor.</P>
<P>Mean while Alcander not only felt the pain of being &s;eparated from his friend and his mi&s;tre&s;s, but a pro&s;ecution was al&s;o commenced again&s;t him by the relations of Hypatia, for his having ba&s;ely given her up, as was &s;ugge&s;ted, for money. His innocence of the crime laid to his charge, or his eloquence in his own defence, were not able to with&s;tand the influence of a powerful party.</P>
<P>He was ca&s;t and condemned to pay an enor|mous fine. Unable to rai&s;e to large a &s;um at the time appointed, his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were confi&s;|cated, him&s;elf &s;tript of the habit of freedom, expo&s;ed in the market-place, and &s;old as a &s;lave to the highe&s;t bidder.</P>
<P>A merchant of Thrace becoming his pur|cha&s;er, Alcander, with &s;ome other companions of di&s;tre&s;s, was carried into the region of de&s;olation and &s;terility. His &s;tated employment was to fol|low the herds of an imperious ma&s;ter, and his &s;kill in hunting was all that was allowed him to &s;upply a precarious &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Condemned to
<PB N="19" REF="22">
hopele&s;s &s;ervitude every morning, waked him to a renewal of famine or toil, and every change of &s;ea&s;on &s;erved but to aggravate his un&s;heltered di&s;tre&s;s. Nothing but death or flight was left him, and almo&s;t certain death was the con&s;e|quence of his attempting to fly. After &s;ome years of bondage, however, an opportunity of e&s;caping offered; he embraced it with ardour, and travelling by night, and lodging in caverns by day, to &s;horten a long &s;tory, he at la&s;t arrived in Rome. The day of Alcander's arrival, Sep|timius &s;ate in the forum admini&s;tring ju&s;tice; and hither our wanderer came, expecting to be in&s;tantly known, and publickly acknowledged. Here he &s;tood the whole day among the crowd, watching the eyes of the judge, and expecting to be taken notice of, but &s;o much was he altered by a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of hard&s;hips, that he pa&s;&s;ed entirely without notice; and in the evening, when he was going up to the praetor's chair, he was brutally repul&s;ed by the attending lictors. The attention of the poor is generally driven from one ungrateful object to another. Night coming on, he now found him&s;elf under a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of &s;eeking a place to lie in, and yet knew not where to apply. All emaciated, and in rags as he was, none of the citizens would harbour &s;o much wretchedne&s;s, and &s;leeping in the &s;treets might be attended with interruption or danger: In &s;hort, he was obliged to take up his lodging in
<PB N="20" REF="23">
one of the tombs without the city, the u&s;ual retreat of guilt, poverty or de&s;pair.</P>
<P>In this man&s;ion of horror, laying his head upon an inverted urn, he forgot his mi&s;eries for a while in &s;leep, and virtue found, on this flinty couch, more ea&s;e than down can &s;upply to the guilty.</P>
<P>It was midnight, when two robbers came to make this cave their retreat, but happening to di&s;agree about the divi&s;ion of their plunder, one of them &s;tabbed the other to the heart, and left him weltering in blood at the entrance. In the&s;e circum&s;tances he was found next morning, and this naturally induced, a further enquiry. The alarm was &s;pread, the cave was examined, Al|cander was found &s;leeping, and immediately ap|prehended and accu&s;ed of robbery and murder. The circum&s;tances again&s;t him were &s;trong, and the wretchedne&s;s of his appearance confirmed &s;u&s;picion. Misfortune and he were now &s;o long acquainted, that he at la&s;t became regardle&s;s of life. He dete&s;ted a world where he had found only ingratitude, fal&s;hood and cruelty, and was determined to make no defence. Thus lowering with re&s;olution; he was dragged, bound with cords, before the tribunal of Septimius. The proofs were po&s;itive again&s;t him, and he offered nothing in his own vindication; the judge, therefore, was
<PB N="21" REF="24">
proceeding to doom him to a mo&s;t cruel and ignominious death, when, as if illumined by a ray from heaven, he di&s;covered, through all his mi&s;ery, the features, though dim with &s;orrow, of his long lo&s;t, lov'd Alcander. It is impo&s;|ble to de&s;cribe his joy and his pain on this &s;trange occa&s;ion. Happy in once more &s;eeing the per&s;on he mo&s;t loved on earth, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed at finding him in &s;uch circum&s;tances. Thus agitated by con|tending pa&s;&s;ions, he flew from his tribunal, and falling on the neck of his dear benefactor, bur&s;t into an agony of di&s;tre&s;s. The attention of the multitude was &s;oon, however, divided by another object. The robber, who had been really guilty, was apprehended &s;elling his plunder, and, &s;truck with a panic, confe&s;&s;ed his crime. He was brought bound to the &s;ame tribunal, and acquitted every other per&s;on of any partner&s;hip in his guilt. Need the &s;equel be related? Alcander was acquit|ted, &s;hared the friend&s;hip and the honours of his friend Septimius, lived afterwards in happine&s;s and ea&s;e, and left it to be engraved on his tomb, <HI>That no circum&s;tances are &s;o de&s;perate, which provi|dence may not relieve.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A LETTER FROM Mr. VOLTAIRE, TO Mr. D'ARGET, of LAUSANNE.</HEAD>
<P>YOU demand, my dear friend and compa|nion of Pot&s;dam, in what manner <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">K. of Pru&s;&s;ia.</NOTE> Pyrrhus and <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">M. de Voltaire.</NOTE> Cineas have been reconciled. Fir&s;t, then, Pyrrhus turned my tragedy of Merope into an opera, which he &s;ent me. Again he was &s;o kind as to offer me his key, which, however, will not &s;erve to open Paradi&s;e; and to this he added an offer of all his favours; but I am too old to ac|cept of the favours of kings at pre&s;ent. To one of his &s;i&s;ters, who has ever pre&s;erved a friend|&s;hip for me, I am obliged for the&s;e marks of kind|ne&s;s. To her I owe the corre&s;pondence which is now and then renewed between the heroic, poetical, warlike, &s;ingular, brilliant, proud, mo|de&s;t
<PB N="23" REF="26">
king, and Cineas the Swi&s;s, retired from the world to happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Would you be &s;o good as to pay us a &s;hort vi&s;it in this part of the world, I fancy we could &s;pend the time agreeably enough; the world does not afford a finer pro&s;pect than that from one of my windows. Imagine a canal on one &s;ide, that lengthens out of &s;ight, bordered by an hundred gardens; on the other, the va&s;t Genevan lake, like a boundle&s;s mirrour, reflects the mountains on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, that lift them&s;elves above the clouds, in form of the mo&s;t magnificent am|phitheatre; and then I am &s;o &s;uited with an hou&s;e, I feel no inconvenience except from flies in the mid&s;t of winter. Madame Dennis has &s;hewed the elegance of her ta&s;te in the furniture. We live here much more comfortably than Pyrrhus, and I fancy fare better too, when we have a good appetite; without this, neither Pyrr|hus nor Cineas can be happy.</P>
<P>We acted a tragedy ye&s;terday; if you chu&s;e to take a part, you have only to come to be fitted. In this manner we forget the quarrels of kings and of men of letters, tho&s;e frightful, the&s;e ri|diculous! We have had a premature account of a battle between Mar&s;hal Richelieu and the Prince of Brun&s;wick. I know not whether the Prince can &s;ucceed, for it is certain I have won fifty guineas
<PB N="24" REF="27">
from him at che&s;s. However, it is po&s;&s;ible to lo&s;e at che&s;s, and win at a game where people play with thirty thou&s;and bayonets.</P>
<P>I grant you that the king of Pru&s;&s;ia may have &s;ome foibles, but no body under&s;tands the game he is playing better than he. He has infinite di&s;patch, and his troops have been di&s;ciplined long before he came to command them. It is an ea&s;y matter to conceive how regular machines mu&s;t behave, who have long been u&s;ed to war, who &s;ee their &s;overeign at their head, who are per&s;onally known to him, and whom he exhorts with his hat in his hand to do their duty. Drole fellows the&s;e at a platoon, at handling their cartridges, and firing &s;ix or &s;even times in a minute. Yet with all this dexterity their ma&s;ter lately thought that all was lo&s;t. About three months ago he was di&s;po&s;ed to die; he bid me adieu both in ver&s;e and pro&s;e, but he is now quite recovered. By his di&s;cipline and di&s;patch he has gained two great battles in the &s;pace of a month. He flies to the French, turns back upon the Au&s;trians, re|takes Bre&s;lau, takes forty thou&s;and pri&s;oners of war, and makes epigrams. We &s;hall &s;ee how this bloody tragedy, &s;o pathetic, and yet &s;o complicated, will end.</P>
<P>Happy they, who, with an eye of tranquility, can behold the&s;e great events of the be&s;t of po&s;|&s;ible

&s;y&s;tems. As for the affair of the Abbe Prade, I have yet been able to receive no authentic in|formation. Fame &s;ays he is hanged; but &s;he knows not what &s;he &s;ays. I &s;hould be &s;orry that all the king's readers &s;hould come to an unhappy end.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear WILL,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU &s;ee, by the date of my letter, that I am arrived in Poland. When will my wan|derings be at an end? When will my re&s;tle&s;s di&s;|po&s;ition give me leave to enjoy the pre&s;ent hour? When at Lyons, I thought all happine&s;s lay be|yond the Alps; when in Italy, I found my&s;elf &s;till in want of &s;omething, and expected to leave &s;oli|citude behind me by going into Romelia, and now you find me turning back, &s;till expecting ea&s;e every where but where I am. It is now &s;even, years &s;ince I &s;aw the face of a &s;ingle crea|ture

who cared a farthing whether I was dead or alive. Secluded from all the comforts of con|fidence, friend&s;hip, or &s;ociety, I feel the &s;olitude of an hermit, but not his ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The prince of * * * has taken me in his train, &s;o that I am in no danger of &s;tarving for this bout. The prince's governor is a rude igno|rant pedant, and his tutor a battered rake: thus, between two &s;uch characters you may imagine he is finely in&s;tructed. I made &s;ome attempts to di&s;|play all the little knowledge I had acquired by reading or ob&s;ervation; but I find my&s;elf re|garded as an ignorant intruder. The truth is, I &s;hall naver be able to acquire a power of expre&s;|&s;ing my&s;elf with ea&s;e in any language but my own; and out of my own country the highe&s;t character I can ever acquire, is that of being a philo&s;ophic vagabond.</P>
<P>When I con&s;ider my&s;elf in the country which was once &s;o formidable in war, and &s;pread terror and de&s;olation over the whole Roman empire, I can hardly account for the pre&s;ent wretchedne&s;s and pu&s;ilanimity of its inhabitants; a prey to every invader; their cities plundered without an enemy; their magi&s;trates &s;eeking redre&s;s by complaints, and not by vigour. Every thing con&s;pires to rai&s;e my compa&s;&s;ion for their mi&s;eries, were not my thoughts too bu&s;ily engaged by my own. The

whole kingdom is in &s;trange di&s;order; when our equipage, which con&s;i&s;ts of the prince and thirteen attendants, had arrived at &s;ome towns, there were no conveniences to be found, and we were obliged to have girls to conduct us to the next. I have &s;een a woman travel thus on hor&s;eback before us for thirty miles, and think her&s;elf highly paid, and make twenty reverences, upon receiving, with ex|ta&s;y, about two-pence for her trouble. In general we were better &s;erved by the women than the men on tho&s;e occa&s;ions. The men &s;eemed directed by a low &s;ordid intere&s;t alone; they &s;eemed mere machines, and all their thoughts were employed in the care of their hor&s;es If we gently de&s;ired them to make more &s;peed, they took not the lea&s;t notice; kind language was what they had by no means been u&s;ed to. It was proper to &s;peak to them in the tones of anger, and &s;ometimes it was even nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e blows, to excite them to their duty. How different the&s;e from the com|mon people of England, whom a blow might induce to return the affront &s;evenfold. The&s;e poor people, however, from being brought up to vile u&s;age, lo&s;e all the re&s;pect which they &s;hould have for them&s;elves. They have contracted an habit of regarding con&s;traint as the great rule of their duty. When they were treated with mild|ne&s;s, they no longer continued to perceive a &s;upe|riority. They fancied them&s;elves our equals, and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ntinuance of our humanity might probably have

rendered them in&s;olent; but the imperious tone, menaces, and blows at once changed their &s;en&s;a|tions and their ideas: their ears, and their &s;houl|ders taught their &s;ouls to &s;hrink back into &s;ervi|tude, from which they had for &s;ome moments fancied them&s;elves di&s;engaged.</P>
<P>The enthu&s;ia&s;m of liberty an Engli&s;hman, feels is never &s;o &s;trong as when pre&s;ented by &s;uch pro&s;|pects as the&s;e.

<HEAD>A SHORT ACCOUNT Of the late Mr. MAUPERTUIS.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Maupertuis, lately decea&s;ed, was the fir&s;t to whom the Engli&s;h philo&s;ophers owed their being particularly admired by the re&s;t of Europe. The romantic &s;y&s;tem of Des Cartes was adapted to the ta&s;te of the &s;uperficial and the indolent; the foreign univer&s;ities had embraced it with ardour, and &s;uch are &s;eldom convinced of their error 'till all others give up &s;uch fal&s;e opinions as untenable. The philo&s;ophy of Newton, and the metaphy&s;ics of Locke appeared, but, like all new truths, they were at once received with oppo&s;ition and contempt. The Engli&s;h, 'tis true, &s;tudied, under&s;tood, and con&s;equently admired them; it was very different on the continent. Fontenelle, who &s;eemed to pre&s;ide over the republic of letters, unwilling to acknowlege that all his life had been &s;pent in erroneous philo&s;ophy, joined in the uni|ver&s;al di&s;approbation, and the Engli&s;h philo&s;ophers &s;eemed entirely unknown.</P>
<P>Maupertuis, however, made them his &s;tudy; he thought he might oppo&s;e the phy&s;ics of his country,
<PB N="31" REF="34">
and yet &s;till be a good citizen; he defended our countrymen, wrote in their favour, and, at la&s;t, as he had truth on his &s;ide, carried his cau&s;e. Almo&s;t all the learning of the Engli&s;h, 'till very lately, was conveyed in the language of France. The writings of Maupertius &s;pread the reputation of his ma&s;ter Newton, and by an happy fortune have united his fame with that of our human prodigy.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of his performances, openly, in vindica|tion of the Newtonian &s;y&s;tem, is his treati&s;e en|tituled, <HI>Sur la figure des A&s;tres,</HI> if I remember right; a work at once expre&s;&s;ive of a deep geometrical knowledge, and the mo&s;t happy manner of deli|vering ab&s;tru&s;e &s;cience with ea&s;e. This met with violent oppo&s;ition from a people, though fond of novelty in every thing el&s;e, yet, however, in mat|ters of &s;cience, attached to antient opinions with bigotry. As the old and the ob&s;tinate fell away, the youth of France embraced the new opinions, and now &s;eem more eager to defend Newton than even his countrymen.</P>
<P>That oddity of character which great men are &s;ometimes remarkable for, Maupertuis was not en|titely free from. If we can believe Voltaire, he once attempted to ca&s;trate him&s;elf; but whether this be true or no, it is certain he was extremely whim&s;ical. Though born to a large fortune,
<GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="2 pages">
<PB N="34" REF="35">
antagoni&s;t for the oppo&s;ite &s;ex, and therefore it was wi&s;ely ordered, that our ladies &s;hould want ta&s;te, le&s;t their admirers &s;hould entirely want rea&s;on.</P>
<P>But to confe&s;s a truth, I do not find they have a greater aver&s;ion to fine cloaths than the women of any other country what&s;oever. I can't fancy that a &s;hopkeeper's wife in Cheap&s;ide has a greater tenderne&s;s for the fortune of her hu&s;band than a citizen's wife in Paris; or that mi&s;s in a boarding-&s;chool is more an oeconomi&s;t in dre&s;s than ma|demoi&s;elle in a nunnery.</P>
<P>Although Paris may be accounted the &s;oil in which almo&s;t every fa&s;hion takes its ri&s;e, its in|fluence is never &s;o general there as with us. They &s;tudy there the happy method of uniting grace and fa&s;hion, and never excu&s;e a woman for being aukwardly dre&s;&s;ed, by &s;aying her cloaths are made in the mode. A French woman is a perfect archi|tect in dre&s;s; &s;he never, with Gothic ignorance, mixes the orders; &s;he never tricks out a &s;quabby Doric &s;hape, with Corinthian finery; or, to &s;peak without metaphor, &s;he conforms to general fa&s;hion, only when it happens not to be repugnant to private beauty.</P>
<P>Our ladies, on the contrary, &s;eem to have no other &s;tandard for grace but the run of the town. If fa&s;hion gives the word, every di&s;tinction of
<PB N="35" REF="36">
beauty, complexion, or &s;tature cea&s;es. Sweeping trains, Pru&s;&s;ian bonnets, and trollopees, as like each other, as if cut from the &s;ame piece, level all to one &s;tandard. The mall, the gardens, and playhou&s;es are filled with ladies in uniform, and their whole appearance &s;hews as little variety or ta&s;te as if their cloaths were be&s;poke by the colonel of a marching regiment, or fancied by the &s;ame arti&s;t who dre&s;&s;es the three battalions of guards.</P>
<P>But not only ladies of every &s;hape and com|plexion, but of every age too, are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this unaccountable pa&s;&s;ion of dre&s;&s;ing in the &s;ame man|ner. A lady of no quality can be di&s;tingui&s;hed from a lady of &s;ome quality only by the redne&s;s of her hands; and a woman of &s;ixty, ma&s;ked, might ea&s;ily pa&s;s for her grand-daughter. I remember, a few days ago, to have walked behind a dam|&s;el, to&s;&s;ed out in all the gaiety of fifteen; her dre&s;s was loo&s;e, un&s;tudied, and &s;eemed the re&s;ult of con&s;cious beauty. I called up all my poetry on this occa&s;ion, and fancied twenty Cupids prepared for execution in every folding of her white negli|gee. I had prepared my imagination for an angel's face; but what was my mortification to find that the imaginary godde&s;s was no other than my cou&s;in Hannah, four years older than my&s;elf, and I &s;hall be &s;ixty-two the twelfth of next No|vember.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="37">After the tran&s;ports of our fir&s;t &s;alute were over, I could not avoid running my eye over her whole appearance. Her gown was of cambrick, cut &s;hort before, in order to di&s;cover an high-heeled &s;hoe, which was buckled almo&s;t at the toe. Her cap, if cap it might be called that cap was none, con&s;i&s;ted of a few bits of cambrick, and flowers of painted paper &s;tuck on one &s;ide of her head. Her bo&s;om, that had felt no hand, but the hand of time, the&s;e twenty years, ro&s;e, &s;uing, but in vain, to be pre&s;&s;ed. I could, indeed, have wi&s;hed her more than an handkerchief of Paris net to &s;hade her beauties; for, as Ta&s;&s;o &s;ays of the ro&s;e|bud, <HI>Quanto &s;i mo&s;tra men tanto epiu bella,</HI> I &s;hould think her's mo&s;t plea&s;ing when lea&s;t di&s;covered.</P>
<P>As my cou&s;in had not put on all this finery for nothing, &s;he was at that time &s;allying out to the park, when I had overtaken her. Perceiving, how|ever, that I had on my be&s;t wig, &s;he offered, if I would '&s;quire her there, to &s;end home the foot|man. Though I trembled for our reception in public, yet I could not, with any civility, refu&s;e; &s;o, to be as gallant as po&s;&s;ible, I took her hand in my arm, and thus we marched on together.</P>
<P>When we made our entry at the Park, two antiquated figures, &s;o polite and &s;o tender as we &s;eemed to be, &s;oon attracted the eyes of the com|pany. As we made our way among crowds who
<PB N="37" REF="38">
were out to &s;hew their finery as well as we, wherever we came I perceived we brought good-humour in our train. The polite could not for|bear &s;miling, and the vulgar bur&s;t out into a hor&s;e laugh at our grote&s;que figures. Cou&s;in Hannah, who was perfectly con&s;cious of the rectitude of her own appearance, attributed all this mirth to the oddity of mine; while I as cordially placed the whole to her ac|count. Thus, from being two of the be&s;t-natured creatures alive, before we got half way up the mall, we both began to grow peevi&s;h, and, like two mice on a &s;tring, endeavoured to revenge the impertinence of others upon our&s;elves. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am amazed, cou&s;in Jeffery, &s;ays mi&s;s, that I can never get you to dre&s;s like a Chri&s;tian. I knew we &s;hould have the eyes of the Park upon us, with your great wig &s;o frizzed, and yet &s;o beggarly, and your mon&s;trous muff. I hate  tho&s;e odious muffs."</Q> I could have patiently borne a critici&s;m on all the re&s;t of my equipage; but, as I had always a peculiar veneration for my muff, I could not forbear being piqued a little; and throwing my eyes with a &s;piteful air on her bo&s;om, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I could heartily wi&s;h, madam, replied I, that, for your &s;ake, my muff was cut into a tippet."</Q></P>
<P>As my cou&s;in, by this time, was grown heartily a&s;hamed of her gentleman u&s;her, and as I was never very fond of any kind of exhibition my&s;elf, it was
<PB N="38" REF="39">
mutually agreed to retire, for a while, to one of the &s;eats, and from that retreat, remark on others as freely as they had remarked on us.</P>
<P>When &s;eated we continued &s;ilent for &s;ome time, employed in very different &s;peculations. I regarded the whole company now pa&s;&s;ing in re|view before me, as drawn out merely for my amu&s;ement. For my entertainment the beauty had all that morning been improving her charms, the beau had put on lace, and the young doctor a big wig, merely to plea&s;e me. But quite different were the &s;entiments of cou&s;in Hannah; &s;he re|garded every well-dre&s;&s;ed woman as a victorious rival, hated every face that &s;eemed dre&s;&s;ed in good humour, or wore the appearance of greater happi|ne&s;s than her own. I perceived her unea&s;ine&s;s, and attempted to le&s;&s;en it, by ob&s;erving that there was no company in the Park to-day. To this &s;he readily a&s;&s;ented; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and yet, &s;ays &s;he, it is full enough of &s;crubs of one kind or another."</Q> My &s;miling at this ob&s;ervation gave her &s;pirits to pur|&s;ue the bent of her inclination, and now &s;he be|gan to exhibit her &s;kill in &s;ecret hi&s;tory, as &s;he found me di&s;po&s;ed to li&s;ten. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ob&s;erve, &s;ays &s;he to me, that old woman in tawdry &s;ilk, and dre&s;&s;ed out even beyond the fa&s;hion. That is mi&s;s Biddy Evergreen. Mi&s;s Biddy, it &s;eems, has money, and as &s;he con&s;iders that money was never &s;o &s;carce as it is now, &s;he &s;eems re|&s;olved to keep what &s;he has to her&s;elf. She is

All her time is pa&s;&s;ed between &s;ickne&s;s and finery. Thus &s;he &s;pends the whole week in a clo&s;e chamber, with no other com|pany but her monkey, her apothecary, and cat, and comes dre&s;&s;ed out to the Park every Sunday, to &s;hew her airs, to get new lovers, to catch a new cold, and to make new work for the doctor.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There goes Mrs. Roundabout, I mean the fat lady in the lute&s;tring trollopee. Between you and I, &s;he is but a cutler's wife.

Odious pu&s;s, how &s;he waddles along, with her train two yards behind her! She puts me in mind of my lord Bantam's Indian &s;heep, which are obliged to have their mon&s;trous tails trundled along in a go-cart. For all her airs, it goes to her hu&s;band's heart to &s;ee four yards of good lute&s;tring wearing again&s;t the ground, like one of his knives on a grind&s;tone. To

&s;peak my mind, cou&s;in Jeffery, I never liked tho&s;e tails; for &s;uppo&s;e a young fellow &s;hould be rude, and the lady &s;hould offer to &s;tep back in a fright, in&s;tead of retiring, &s;he treads upon her train, and falls fairly on her back; and then you know, cou&s;in,&mdash;her cloaths may be &s;poiled.</Q></P>

<HEAD>SOME PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO CHARLES XII. Not commonly known.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Stockholm,</DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Cannot re&s;i&s;t your &s;olicitations, though it is po&s;&s;ible I &s;hall be unable to &s;atisfy your curio|&s;ity. The polite of every country &s;eem to have but one character. A gentleman of Sweden dif|fers but little, except in trifles, from one of any other country. It is among the vulgar we are to find tho&s;e di&s;tinctions which characterize a people, and from them it is that I take my picture of the Swedes.</P>
<P>Though the Swedes in general appear to langui&s;h under oppre&s;&s;ion, which often renders others wicked, or of malignant di&s;po&s;itions, it has not, however, the &s;ame influence upon them, as they are faithful, civil, and incapable of atrocious
<PB N="43" REF="44">
crimes. Would you believe that in Sweden high|way robberies are not &s;o much as heard of; for my part I have not in the whole country &s;een a gibbet or a gallows. They pay an infinite re&s;pect to their eccle&s;ia&s;tics, whom they &s;uppo&s;e to be the privy coun&s;ellors of providence, who, on their part, turn this credulity to their own advantage, and manage their pari&s;hioners as they plea&s;e. In general, however, they &s;eldom abu&s;e their &s;ove|reign authority. Hearkened to as oracles, re|garded as the di&s;pen&s;ers of eternal rewards and puni&s;hments, they readily influence their hearers into ju&s;tice, and make them practical philo&s;ophers without the pains of &s;tudy.</P>
<P>As to their per&s;ons they are perfectly well made, and the men particularly have a very engaging air. The greate&s;t part of the boys which I &s;aw in the country, had very white hair. They were as beautiful as Cupids, and there was &s;omething open and entirely happy in their little chubby faces. The girls, on the contrary, have neither &s;uch fair, nor &s;uch even complexions, and their features are much le&s;s delicate, which is a circum|&s;tance different from that of almo&s;t every other country. Be&s;ides this, it is ob&s;erved that the women are generally afflicted with the itch, for which Scania is particularly remarkable. I had an in&s;tance of this in one of the inns on the road. The ho&s;te&s;s was one of the mo&s;t beautiful women I have ever
<PB N="44" REF="45">
&s;een; &s;he had &s;o fine a complexion, that I could not avoid admiring it. But what was my &s;urprize when &s;he opened her bo&s;om in order to &s;uckle her child, to perceive that &s;eat of delight, all covered with this di&s;agreeable di&s;temper. The carele&s;s manner in which &s;he expo&s;ed to our eyes &s;o di&s;|gu&s;ting an object, &s;ufficiently te&s;tifies that they regard it as no very extraordinary malady, and &s;eem to take no pains to conceal it. Such are the remarks, which probably you may think trifling enough, I have made in my journey to Stock|holm, which, to take it all together, is a large, beautiful, and even populous city.</P>
<P>The ar&s;enal appears to me one of its greate&s;t curio&s;ities; it is an hand&s;ome &s;pacious building, but however illy &s;tored with the implements of war. To recompence this defect, they have al|mo&s;t filled it with trophies, and other marks of their former military glory. I &s;aw there &s;everal chambers filled with Dani&s;h, Saxon, Poli&s;h, and Ruffian &s;tandards. There was at lea&s;t enough to &s;uffice half a dozen armies; but new &s;tandards are more ea&s;ily made than new armies can be en|li&s;ted. I &s;aw, be&s;ides, &s;ome very rich furniture, and &s;ome of the crown jewels of great value, but what principally engaged my attention, and touched me with pa&s;&s;ing melancholy, were the bloody, yet precious &s;poils, of the two greate&s;t heroes the north ever produced. What I mean
<PB N="45" REF="46">
are the cloaths in which the great Gu&s;tavus Adol|phus, and the intrepid Charles XII. died, by a fate not u&s;ual to kings. The fir&s;t, if I remember, is a &s;ort of a buff wai&s;tcoat, made antique fa&s;hion, very plain, and without the lea&s;t ornaments; the &s;econd, which was even more remarkable, con|&s;i&s;ted only of a coar&s;e blue cloth coat, a large hat of le&s;s value, a &s;hirt of coar&s;e linen, large boots, and buff gloves made to cover a great part of the arm. His &s;addle, his pi&s;tols and his &s;word, have nothing in them remarkable, the meane&s;t &s;oldier was in this re&s;pect no way inferior to his gallant monarch. I &s;hall u&s;e this opportunity to give you &s;ome particulars of the life of a man already &s;o well known, which I had from per&s;ons who knew him when a child, and who now, by a fate not unu&s;ual to courtiers, &s;pend a life of po|verty and retirement, and talk over in raptures all the actions of their old victorious king, com|panion and ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Courage and inflexible con&s;tancy formed the ba&s;is of this monarch's character. In his ten|dere&s;t years he gave in&s;tances of both. When he was yet &s;carce &s;even years old, being at dinner with the queen his mother, intending to give a bit of bread to a great dog he was fond of, this hungry animal &s;napt too greedily at the mor&s;el, and bit his hand in a terrible manner. The wound bled copiou&s;ly, but our young hero,
<PB N="46" REF="47">
without offering to cry, or taking the lea&s;t notice of his misfortune, endeavoured to conceal what had happened, le&s;t his dog &s;hould be brought into trouble, and wrapped his bloody hand in the nap|kin. The queen perceiving that he did not eat, a&s;ked him the rea&s;on. He contented him&s;elf with replying, that he thanked her, he was not hungry. They thought he was taken ill, and &s;o repeated their &s;olicitations. But all was in vain, though the poor child was already grown pale with the lo&s;s of blood. An officer who attended at table, at la&s;t perceived it; for Charles would &s;ooner have died than betrayed his dog, whom he knew intended no injury.</P>
<P>At another time, when in the &s;mall pox, and his ca&s;e appeared dangerous, he grew one day very unea&s;y in his bed, and a gentleman who watched him, de&s;irous of covering him up clo&s;e, received from the patient a violent box on his ear. Some hours after ob&s;erving the prince more calm, he entreated to know how he had incurred his di&s;plea&s;ure, or what he had done to have merited a blow. A blow, replied Charles, I don't re|member any thing of it; I remember, indeed, that I thought my&s;elf in the battle of Arbela, fighting for Darius, where I gave Alexander a blow, which brought him to the ground.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="48">What great effects might not the&s;e two quali|ties of courage and con&s;tancy have produced, had they at fir&s;t received a ju&s;t direction. Charles, with proper in&s;truction, thus naturally di&s;po&s;ed, would have been the delight and the glory of his age. Happy tho&s;e princes, who are educated by men who are at once vertuous and wi&s;e, and have been for &s;ome time in the &s;chool of affliction; who weigh happine&s;s again&s;t glory, and teach their royal pupils the real value of fame; who are ever &s;hewing the &s;uperior dignity of man to that of royalty; that a pea&s;ant who does his duty is a nobler character than a king of even middling reputation. Happy, I &s;ay, were princes, could &s;uch men be found to in&s;truct them, but tho&s;e to whom &s;uch an education is generally in|tru&s;ted, are men who them&s;elves have acted in a &s;phere too high to know mankind. Puffed up them&s;elves with ideas of fal&s;e grandeur, and mea&s;uring merit by adventitious circum&s;tances of greatne&s;s, they generally communicate tho&s;e fatal prejudices to their pupils, confirm their pride by adulation, or encrea&s;e their ignorance by teaching them to de&s;pi&s;e that wi&s;dom which is found among the poor.</P>
<P>But not to moralize when I only intend a Story; what is related of the journies of this prince is no le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hing. He has &s;ometimes been on hor&s;eback for four and twenty hours &s;ucce&s;&s;ively,
<PB N="48" REF="49">
and thus traver&s;ed the greate&s;t part of his kingdom. At la&s;t none of his officers were found capable of following him; he thus con&s;equently rode the greate&s;t part of the&s;e journies quite alone, without taking a moment's repo&s;e, and without any other &s;ub&s;i&s;tence but a bit of bread. In one of the&s;e rapid cour&s;es, he underwent an adventure &s;ingu|lar enough. Riding thus po&s;t one day, all alone, he had the misfortune to have his hor&s;e fall dead under him. This might have embarra&s;&s;ed an or|dinary man, but it gave Charles no &s;ort of unea|&s;ine&s;s. Sure of finding another hor&s;e, but not equally &s;o of meeting with a good &s;addle and pi&s;tols, he ungirds his hor&s;e, claps the whole equipage on his own back, and thus accoutred, marches on to the next inn, which by good for|tune was not far off. Entering the &s;table, he here found an hor&s;e entirely to his mind; &s;o, without further ceremony, he clapped on his &s;addle and hou&s;ing with great compo&s;ure, and was ju&s;t going to mount, when the gentleman who owned the hor&s;e was apprized of a &s;tranger's going to &s;teal his property out of the &s;table. Upon a&s;king the king, whom he had never &s;een, bluntly, how he pre&s;umed to meddle with his hor&s;e, Charles coolly replied, &s;queezing in his lips, which was his u&s;ual cu&s;tom, that he took the hor&s;e becau&s;e he wanted one; for you &s;ee, continued he, if I have none, I &s;hall be obliged to carry the &s;addle my&s;elf. This an&s;wer did not &s;eem at all &s;ati&s;|factory
<PB N="49" REF="50">
to the gentleman, who in&s;tantly drew his &s;word. In this the king was not much behind hand with him, and to it they were going, when the guards, by this time, came up, and te&s;tified that &s;urprize which was natural, to &s;ee arms in the hand of a &s;ubject again&s;t his king. Imagine whe|ther the gentleman was le&s;s &s;urprized than they at his unpremeditated di&s;obedience. His a&s;toni&s;h|ment, however, was &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated by the king, who, taking him by the hand, a&s;&s;ured him he was a brave fellow, and him&s;elf would take care he &s;hould be provided for. This promi&s;e was after|wards fulfilled; and I have been a&s;&s;ured the king made him a captain.</P>

<HEAD>HAPPINESS, In a great Mea&s;ure, Dependant on CONSTITUTION.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I reflect on the unambitious re|tirement in which I pa&s;&s;ed the earlier part of my life in the country, I cannot avoid feeling &s;ome pain in thinking that tho&s;e happy days are never to return. In that retreat all nature &s;eemed capable of affording plea&s;ure; I then made no refinements on happine&s;s, but could be plea&s;ed with the mo&s;t aukward efforts of ru&s;tic mirth; thought cro&s;s-purpo&s;es the highe&s;t &s;tretch of hu|man wit, and que&s;tions and commands the mo&s;t rational amu&s;ement for &s;pending the evening. Happy could &s;o charming an illu&s;ion &s;till con|tinue. I find age and knowledge only contribute to &s;our our di&s;po&s;itions. My pre&s;ent enjoyments may be more refined, but they are infinitely le&s;s plea&s;ing. The plea&s;ure Garrick gives, can no way compare to that I have received from a coun|try wag, who imitated a quaker's &s;ermon. The mu&s;ic of Matei is di&s;&s;onance to what I felt when our old dairy-maid &s;ung me into tears with Johnny
<PB N="52" REF="53">
Arm&s;trong's La&s;t Good Night, or the Cruelty of Barbara Allen.</P>
<P>Writers of every age have endeavoured to &s;hew that plea&s;ure is in us, and not in the objects of|fered for our amu&s;ement. If the &s;oul be happily di&s;po&s;ed, every thing becomes a &s;ubject of enter|tainment, and di&s;tre&s;s will almo&s;t want a name. Every occurrence pa&s;&s;es in review like the figures of a proce&s;&s;ion; &s;ome may be aukward, others ill dre&s;&s;ed; but none but a fool is for this en|raged with the ma&s;ter of the ceremonies.</P>
<P>I remember to have once &s;een a &s;lave in a for|tification in Flanders, who appeared no way touched with his &s;ituation. He was maimed, de|formed, and chained; obliged to toil from the appearance of day 'till night-fall, and condemned to this for life; yet, with all the&s;e circum&s;tances of apparent wretchedne&s;s, he &s;ung, would have danced, but that he wanted a leg, and appeared the merrie&s;t, happie&s;t man of all the garri&s;on. What a practi|cal philo&s;opher was here; an happy con&s;titution &s;upplied philo&s;ophy, and though &s;eemingly de&s;ti|tute of wi&s;dom, he was really wi&s;e. No reading or &s;tudy had contributed to di&s;enchant the fairy land around him. Every thing furni&s;hed him with an opportunity of mirth; and though &s;ome thought him from his in&s;en&s;ibility a fool, he was
<PB N="53" REF="54">
&s;uch an ideot as philo&s;ophers might wi&s;h in vain to imitate.</P>
<P>They, who like him, can place them&s;elves on that &s;ide of the world in which every thing appears in a ridiculous or plea&s;ing light, will find &s;ome|thing in every occurrence to excite their good humour. The mo&s;t calamitous events, either to them&s;elves or others, can bring no new affliction; the whole world is to them a theatre, on which comedies only are acted. All the bu&s;tle of he|roi&s;m, or the rants of ambition, &s;erve only to heighten the ab&s;urdity of the &s;cene, and make the humour more poignant. They feel, in &s;hort, as little angui&s;h at their own di&s;tre&s;s, or the com|plaints of others, as the undertaker, though dre&s;&s;ed in black, feels &s;orrow at a funeral.</P>
<P>Of all the men I ever read of, the famous Car|dinal De Retz po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this happine&s;s of temper in the highe&s;t degree. As he was a man of gallantry, and de&s;pi&s;ed all that wore the pedantic appearance of philo&s;ophy, wherever plea&s;ure was to be &s;old, he was generally foremo&s;t to rai&s;e the auction. Being an univer&s;al admirer of the fair &s;ex, when he found one lady cruel, he generally fell in love with another, from whom he expected a more favourable reception: If &s;he too rejected his ad|dre&s;&s;es, he never thought of retiring into de&s;arts, or pining in hopele&s;s di&s;tre&s;s. He per&s;uaded him|&s;elf,
<PB N="54" REF="55">
that in&s;tead of loving the lady, he only fan|cied he had loved her, and &s;o all was well again. When fortune wore her angrie&s;t look, when he at la&s;t fell into the power of his mo&s;t deadly enemy Cardinal Mazarine, and was confined a clo&s;e pri&s;oner in the ca&s;tle of Valenciennes, he never attempted to &s;upport his di&s;tre&s;s by wi&s;dom or philo&s;ophy, for he pretended to neither. He laughed at him&s;elf and his per&s;ecutor, and &s;eemed infinitely plea&s;ed at his new &s;ituation.

<P>All that philo&s;ophy can teach, is to be &s;tubborn or &s;ullen under misfortunes. The Cardinal's ex|ample will in&s;truct us to be merry in circum&s;tances of the highe&s;t affliction. It matters not whether our good humour be con&s;trued by others into in&s;en&s;ibility, or even ideoti&s;m; it is happine&s;s to our&s;elves, and none but a fool would mea&s;ure his &s;ati&s;faction by what the world thinks of it.</P>
<P>Dick Wildgoo&s;e was one of the happie&s;t &s;illy fellows I ever knew. He was of the number of
<PB N="55" REF="56">
tho&s;e good-natured creatures that are &s;aid to do no harm to any but them&s;elves. Whenever Dick fell into any mi&s;ery, he u&s;ually called it <HI>&s;eeing life.</HI> If his head was broke by a chairman, or his pocket picked by a &s;harper, he comforted him&s;elf by imi|tating the Hibernian dialect of the one, or the more fa&s;hionable cant of the other. Nothing came ami&s;s to Dick. His inattention to money matters had incen&s;ed his father to &s;uch a degree, that all the interce&s;&s;ion of friends in his favour, was fruitle&s;s. The old gentleman was on his death|bed. The whole family, and Dick among the number, gathered around him. I leave my &s;econd &s;on Andrew, &s;aid the expiring mi&s;er, my whole e&s;tate, and de&s;ire him to be frugal. Andrew, in a &s;orrowful tone, as is u&s;ual on the&s;e occa&s;ions, <HI>Prayed heaven to prolong his life and health to enjoy it him&s;elf.</HI> I recommend Simon, my third &s;on, to the care of his elder brother, and leave him be&s;ide four thou&s;and pounds. Ah! father, cried Simon, (in great affliction to be &s;ure) <HI>May heaven give you life and health to enjoy it your&s;elf.</HI> At la&s;t, turning to poor Dick; as for you, you have al|ways been a &s;ad dog, you'll never come to good, you'll never be rich, I'll leave you a &s;hilling to buy an halter. Ah! father, cries Dick, without any emotion, <HI>May heaven give you life and health to enjoy it your&s;elf.</HI> This was all the trouble the lo&s;s of fortune gave this thought|le&s;s imprudent creature. However, the tender|ne&s;s
<PB N="56" REF="57">
of an uncle recompenced the neglect of a father; and Dick is now not only exce&s;&s;ively good-humoured, but competently rich.</P>
<P>The world, in &s;hort, may cry out at a bank|rupt who appears at a ball; at an author who laughs at the public which pronounces him a dunce; at a general who &s;miles at the reproach of the vulgar, or the lady who keeps her good hu|mour in &s;pite of &s;candal; but &s;uch is the wi&s;e&s;t behaviour they can po&s;&s;ibly a&s;&s;ume; it is certainly a better way to oppo&s;e calamity by di&s;&s;ipation, than to take up the arms of rea&s;on or re&s;olution to oppo&s;e it: By the fir&s;t method we forget our mi&s;eries, by the la&s;t we only conceal them from others; by &s;truggling with misfortunes, we are &s;ure to receive &s;ome wounds in the conflict. The only method to come off victorious, is by running away.</P>

<HEAD>ON OUR THEATRES.</HEAD>
<P>MAdemoi&s;elle Clairon, a celebrated actre&s;s at Paris, &s;eems to me the mo&s;t perfect fe|male figure I have ever &s;een upon any &s;tage. Not, perhaps, that nature has been more liberal of per|&s;onal beauty to her, than &s;ome to be &s;een upon our theatres at home. There are actre&s;&s;es here who have as much of what connoi&s;&s;eurs call &s;tatuary grace, by which is meant elegance un|connected with motion, as &s;he; but they all fall infinitely &s;hort of her, when the &s;oul comes to give expre&s;&s;ion to the limbs, and animates every feature.</P>
<P>Her fir&s;t appearance is exce&s;&s;ively engaging; &s;he never comes in &s;taring round upon the com|pany, as if &s;he intended to count the benefits of the hou&s;e, or at lea&s;t to &s;ee, as well as be &s;een. Her eyes are always, at fir&s;t, intently fixed upon the per&s;ons of the drama, and &s;he lifts them by degrees, with enchanting diffidence, upon the &s;pectators. Her fir&s;t &s;peech, or at lea&s;t the fir&s;t part of it, is delivered with &s;carce any motion of the arm; her hands and her tongue never &s;et out together; but the one prepares us for the
<PB N="58" REF="59">
other. She &s;ometimes begins with a mute, eloquent attitude; but never goes forward all at once with hands, eyes, head, and voice. This ob&s;ervation, though it may appear of no importance, &s;hould certainly be adverted to; nor do I &s;ee any one performer (Garrick only excepted) among us, that is not, in this particular, apt to offend. By this &s;imple beginning &s;he gives her&s;elf a power of ri&s;ing in the pa&s;&s;ion of the &s;cene. As &s;he pro|ceeds, every ge&s;ture, every look acquires new violence, till at la&s;t tran&s;ported, &s;he fills the whole vehemence of the part, and all the idea of the poet.</P>
<P>Her hands are not alternately &s;tretched out, and then drawn in again, as with the &s;inging women at Sadler's-wells; they are employed with graceful variety, and every moment plea&s;e with new and unexpected eloquence. Add to this, that their motion is generally from the &s;houlder; &s;he never flouri&s;hes her hands while the upper part of her arm is motionle&s;s, nor has &s;he the ri|diculous appearance, as if her elbows were pinned to her hips.</P>
<P>But of all the cautions to be given our ri&s;ing actre&s;&s;es, I would particularly recommend it to them never to take notice of the audience, upon any occa&s;ion what&s;oever; let the &s;pectators ap|plaud never &s;o loudly, their prai&s;es &s;hould pa&s;s,
<PB N="59" REF="60">
except at the end of the epilogue, with &s;eeeming inattention. I can never pardon a lady on the &s;tage who, when &s;he draws the admiration of the whole audience, turns about to make them a low courte&s;y for their applau&s;e. Such a figure no longer continues Belvidera, but at once drops into Mrs. Cibber. Suppo&s;e a &s;ober trade&s;man, who once a year takes his &s;hilling's worth at Drury-lane, in order to be delighted with the figure of a queen, the queen of Sheba for in&s;tance, or any other queen: This hone&s;t man has no other idea of the great but from their &s;uperior pride and impertinence: Suppo&s;e &s;uch a man placed among the &s;pectators, the fir&s;t figure that pre&s;ents on the &s;tage is the queen her&s;elf, courte|fying and cringing to all the company; how can he fancy her the haughty favourite of king Solomon the wi&s;e, who appears actually more &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive than the wife of his bo&s;om. We are all trade&s;men of a nicer reli&s;h in this re&s;pect, and &s;uch a conduct mu&s;t di&s;gu&s;t every &s;pectator who loves to have the illu&s;ion of nature &s;trong upon him.</P>
<P>Yet, while I recommend to our actre&s;&s;es a &s;kil|ful attention to ge&s;ture, I would not have them &s;tudy it in the looking-gla&s;s. This, without &s;ome precaution, will render their action formal; by too great an intimacy with this, they become &s;tiff and affected. People &s;eldom improve, when they have no other model but them&s;elves to copy after.
<PB N="60" REF="61">
I remember to have known a notable performer of the other &s;ex, who made great u&s;e of this flatter|ing monitor, and yet was one of the &s;tiffe&s;t figures I ever &s;aw. I am told his apartment was hung round with looking-gla&s;s, that he might &s;ee his per&s;on twenty times reflected upon entering the room; and I will make bold to &s;ay, he &s;aw twenty very ugly fellows whenever he did &s;o.</P>

<HEAD>A LETTER FROM Mr. VOLTAIRE, TO Mr. TIRIOT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Monrion, near Lau&s;anne, <DATE>March 26, 1757.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OF all the prai&s;es you are plea&s;ed to be&s;tow on my trifling E&s;&s;ay on General Hi&s;tory, I can acquie&s;ce only in tho&s;e which you mention of my impartiality, of my love of truth, and my zeal for the happine&s;s of &s;ociety. All my life has been &s;pent in contributing to &s;pread a &s;pirit of philo&s;o|phy and toleration, and &s;uch a &s;pirit now &s;eems to characteri&s;e the age. This glorious &s;pirit, which animates every enlightened mind, has begun to diffu&s;e it&s;elf in this country, where fir&s;t my vale|tudinary con&s;titution, and now the charms of tranquility keep me. It is no &s;mall example of the progre&s;s of human rea&s;on, that my Hi&s;tory has been printed at Geneva with public approba|tion,
<PB N="62" REF="63">
in which I have characterized Calvin as a man of a di&s;po&s;ition as much more villainous as his under&s;tanding was more enlightened than that of the re&s;t of mankind. The death of Servetus appears &s;till abominable. The Dutch blu&s;h when they recollect their cruelty to Barnevelt. I know not whether the Engli&s;h yet find any remor&s;e for theirs to Byng. The attempt and the tortures of Damien have been objected to me as incon|gruous with my character of the pre&s;ent age. Al|mo&s;t every man of any figure in the literary world has demanded, Is this the nation which you have drawn in &s;o amiable a light? Is this the age which you have de&s;cribed, as &s;uperior to others in wi&s;dom? To this I an&s;wer (as I well may) that &s;ome men are of characters very different from that of their country, or the times they live in. A poor madman, of the dregs of the people, is not a model from which to characterize his country. But, on the other hand, Chatel and Ravillac were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an epidemic fury, the &s;pirit of public fanatici&s;m turned their heads; and even &s;o far was the age infected, that I have by me an apology for the behaviour of John Cha|tel, printed during the trial of this unhappy, but deluded creature. It is quite otherwi&s;e at pre|&s;ent; Damien's attempt has been looked upon with indignation not only by France, but by all Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="64">In the little romantic country in which I re&s;ide, lying along the banks of the Genevan lake, we turn with horror from enormities like the&s;e. We act here as they ought to act at Paris; we live with tranquillity; we cultivate learning without divi&s;ions or envy. Tavernier ob&s;erves, that the pro&s;pect of Lau&s;anne from the Genevan lake re&s;embles that of Con&s;tantinople; but what plea&s;es me more than a pro&s;pect is, that love for the arts which in&s;pires the generality of its inha|bitants.</P>
<P>You have not been deceived when it was told you, that Zara, the Prodigal Son, and other plays, have been repre&s;ented here as well as they could have been at Paris: Yet, let not this &s;urprize you; they neither know, nor &s;peak any other language here than that of France. Almo&s;t all the families are of French extraction; and we have as much ta&s;te here as in any part of the world.</P>
<P>We have not here that low ridiculous hi&s;tory of the war in 1741, which they have printed at Paris with my name; nor the pretended <HI>Port &s;euille,</HI> where there are &s;carce three &s;entences of mine; nor that infamous rhap&s;ody, intituled, The Maid of Orleans, replete with lines the mo&s;t low and &s;tupid, that ever e&s;caped from ignorance, and with in&s;olencies the mo&s;t atrocious that ever
<PB N="64" REF="65">
impudence had courage to avow. We mu&s;t own that there have lately been many enormities com|mitted at Paris, with both the dagger and the pen. I con&s;ole my&s;elf, at being di&s;tant from my friends, in finding my&s;elf removed from &s;uch enormities as the&s;e; and I mu&s;t pity that amiable country which can thus produce mon&s;ters.</P>

<HEAD>The BEE. Number III. <DATE>SATURDAY, <HI>October</HI> 20, 1759.</DATE></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="language" TYPE="discourse">
<HEAD>On the USE of LANGUAGE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE manner in which mo&s;t writers begin their treati&s;es on the U&s;e of Language, is generally thus: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Language has been granted to man, in order to di&s;cover his wants and nece&s;&s;ities, &s;o as to have them re|lieved by &s;ociety. Whatever we de&s;ire, what|ever we wi&s;h, it is but to cloath tho&s;e de&s;ires or wi&s;hes in words, in order to fruition; the principal u&s;e of language, therefore, &s;ay they, is to expre&s;s our wants, &s;o as to receive a &s;peedy redre&s;s."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="67">Such an account as this may &s;erve to &s;atisfy grammarians and rhetoricians well enough, but men who know the world, maintain very contrary maxims; they hold, and I think with &s;ome &s;hew of rea&s;on, they hold, that he who be&s;t knows how to conceal his nece&s;&s;ities and de&s;ires, is the mo&s;t likely per&s;on to find redre&s;s, and that the true u&s;e of &s;peech is not &s;o much to expre&s;s our wants as to conceal them.</P>
<P>When we reflect on the manner in which mankind generally confer their favours, we &s;hall find that they who &s;eem to want them lea&s;t, are the very per&s;ons who mo&s;t liberally &s;hare them. There is &s;omething &s;o attractive in riches, that the large heap generally collects from the &s;maller; and the poor find as much plea&s;ure in encrea&s;ing the enor|mous ma&s;s, as the mi&s;er, who owns it, &s;ees hap|pine&s;s in its encrea&s;e. Nor is there in this any thing repugnant to the laws of true morality. Seneca him&s;elf allows, that in conferring benefits, the pre&s;ent &s;hould always be &s;uited to the dignity of the receiver. Thus the rich receive large pre&s;ents, and are thanked for accepting them. Men of middling &s;tations are obliged to be content with pre&s;ents &s;omething le&s;s, while the beggar, who may be truly &s;aid to want indeed, is well paid if a farthing rewards his warme&s;t &s;olicitations.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="68">Every man who has &s;een the world, and has had his <HI>ups and downs in life,</HI> as the expre&s;&s;ion is, mu&s;t have frequently experienced the truth of this doctrine, and mu&s;t know that to have much, or to &s;eem to have it, is the only way to have more. Ovid finely compares a man of broken fortune to a falling column; the lower it &s;inks, the greater weight it is obliged to &s;u&s;tain. Thus, when a man has no occa&s;ion to borrow, he finds numbers willing to lend him. Should he a&s;k his friend to lend him an hundred pounds, it is po&s;&s;ible, from the largene&s;s of his demand, he may find credit for twenty; but &s;hould he humbly only &s;ue for a trifle, it is two to one whether he might be tru&s;ted for two pence. A certain young fellow at George's, whenever he had occa&s;ion to a&s;k his friend for a guinea, u&s;ed to prelude his reque&s;t as if he wanted two hundred, and talked &s;o familiarly of large &s;ums, that none could ever think he wanted a &s;mall one. The &s;ame gentleman, whenever he wanted credit for a new &s;uit from his taylor, al|ways made the propo&s;al in laced cloaths; for he found by experience, that if he appeared &s;habby on the&s;e occa&s;ions, Mr. Lynch had taken an oath again&s;t tru&s;ting; or what was every bit as bad, his foreman was out of the way, and would not be at home the&s;e two days.</P>
<P>There can be no inducement to reveal our wants, except to find pity, and by this means relief; but
<PB N="68" REF="69">
before a poor man opens his mind in &s;uch circum|&s;tances, he &s;hould fir&s;t con&s;ider whether he is con|tented to lo&s;e the e&s;teem of the per&s;on he &s;olicits, and whether he is willing to give up friend&s;hip only to excite compa&s;&s;ion. Pity and friend&s;hip are pa&s;|&s;ions incompatible with each other, and it is im|po&s;&s;ible that both can re&s;ide in any brea&s;t for the &s;malle&s;t &s;pace, without impairing each other. Friend&s;hip is made up of e&s;teem and plea&s;ure; pity is compo&s;ed of &s;orrow and contempt; the mind may for &s;ome time fluctuate between them, but it can never entertain both together.</P>
<P>Yet let it not be thought that I would exclude pity from the human mind. There is &s;carce any who are not in &s;ome degree po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this plea&s;ing &s;oftne&s;s; but it is at be&s;t but a &s;hort-lived pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;eldom affords di&s;tre&s;s more than tran&s;itory a&s;&s;i&s;tance: With &s;ome it &s;carce la&s;ts from the fir&s;t impul&s;e till the hand can be put into the pocket; with others it may continue for twice that &s;pace, and on &s;ome of extraordinary &s;en&s;i|bility, I have &s;een it operate for half an hour. But, however, la&s;t as it will, it generally produces but beggarly effects; and where, from this mo|tive we give an halfpenny, from others we give always pound. In great di&s;tre&s;s we &s;ometimes, it is true, feel the influence of tenderne&s;s &s;trongly; when the &s;ame di&s;tre&s;s &s;olicits a &s;econd time, we then feel with dimini&s;hed &s;en&s;ibility, but like the
<PB N="69" REF="70">
repetition of an eccho, every new impul&s;e becomes weaker, till at la&s;t our &s;en&s;ations lo&s;e every mix|ture of &s;orrow, and degenerate into downright contempt.</P>
<P>Jack Spindle and I were old acquaintance; but he's gone. Jack was bred in a compting-hou&s;e, and his father dying ju&s;t as he was out of his time, left him an hand&s;ome fortune, and many friends to advi&s;e with. The re&s;traint in which he had been brought up, had thrown a gloom upon his temper, which &s;ome regarded as an habitual pru|dence, and from &s;uch con&s;iderations, he had every day repeated offers of friend&s;hip. Tho&s;e who had money, were ready to offer him their a&s;&s;i&s;tance that way; and they who had daughters, frequently, in the warmth of affection, advi&s;ed him to marry. Jack, however, was in good circum&s;tances; he wanted neither money, friends, nor a wife, and therefore mode&s;tly declined their propo&s;als.</P>
<P>Some errors in the management of his affairs, and &s;everal lo&s;&s;es in trade, &s;oon brought Jack to a different way of thinking; and he at la&s;t thought it his be&s;t way to let his friends know that their offers were at length acceptable. His fir&s;t addre&s;s was therefore to a &s;crivener, who had formerly made him frequent offers of money and friend&s;hip, at a time when, perhaps, he knew tho&s;e offers would have been refu&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="71">Jack, therefore, thought he might u&s;e his old friend without any ceremony, and as a man con|fident of not being refu&s;ed, reque&s;ted the u&s;e of an hundred guineas for a few days, as he ju&s;t then had an occa&s;ion for money. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And pray, Mr. Spindle, replied the &s;crivener, do you want all this money?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Want it, Sir, &s;ays the other, if I did not want it, I &s;hould not have a&s;ked it."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am &s;orry for that, &s;ays the friend; for tho&s;e who want money when they come to borrow, will want money when they &s;hould come to pay. To &s;ay the truth, Mr. Spindle, money is money now-a-days. I believe it is all &s;unk in the bot|tom of the &s;ea, for my part; and he that has got a little, is a fool if he does not keep what he has got."</Q></P>
<P>Not quite di&s;concerted by this refu&s;al, our ad|venturer was re&s;olved to apply to another, whom he knew to be the very be&s;t friend he had in the world. The gentleman whom he now addre&s;&s;ed, received his propo&s;al with all the affability that could be expected from generous friend&s;hip. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Let me &s;ee, you want an hundred guineas, and pray, dear Jack, would not fifty an&s;wer."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>If you have but fifty to &s;pare, Sir, I mu&s;t be con|tented.</HI>"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Fifty to &s;pare, I do not &s;ay that, for I believe I have but twenty about me."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Then I mu&s;t borrow the other thirty from &s;ome other friend.</HI>"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And pray, replied the friend, would
<PB N="71" REF="72">
it not be the be&s;t way to borrow the whole money from that other friend, and then one note will &s;erve for all, you know. Lord, Mr. Spin|dle, make no ceremony with me at any time; you know I'm your friend, and when you chu&s;e a bit of dinner or &s;o.&mdash;&mdash;You, Tom, &s;ee the the gentleman down. You wont forget to dine with us now and then. Your very humble &s;er|vant."</Q></P>
<P>Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, but not di&s;couraged at this treat|ment, he was at la&s;t re&s;olved to find that a&s;&s;i&s;tance from love, which he could not have from friend|&s;hip. Mi&s;s Jenny Di&s;mal had a fortune in her own hands, and &s;he had already made all the ad|vances that her &s;ex's mode&s;ty would permit. He made his propo&s;al therefore with confidence, but &s;oon perceived, <HI>No bankrupt ever found the fair one kind.</HI> Mi&s;s Jenny and Ma&s;ter Billy Galloon were lately fallen deeply in love with each other, and the whole neighbourhood thought it would &s;oon be a match.</P>
<P>Every day now began to &s;trip Jack of his former finery; his cloaths flew piece by piece to the pawn|broker's, and he &s;eemed at length equipped in the genuine mourning of antiquity. But &s;till he thought him&s;elf &s;ecure from &s;tarving, the num|berle&s;s invitations he had received to dine, even after his lo&s;&s;es, were yet unan&s;wered; he was therefore now re&s;olved to accept of a dinner be|cau&s;e
<PB N="72" REF="73">
he wanted one; and in this manner he ac|tually lived among his friends a whole week with|out being openly affronted. The la&s;t place I &s;aw poor Jack was at the Rev. Dr. Go&s;ling's. He had, as he fancied, ju&s;t nicked the time, for he came in as the cloth was laying. He took a chair without being de&s;ired, and talked for &s;ome time without being attended to. He a&s;&s;ured the com|pany, that nothing procured &s;o good an appetite as a walk to White Conduit-hou&s;e, where he had been that morning. He looked at the table-cloth, and prai&s;ed the figure of the dama&s;k; talked of a fea&s;t where he had been the day before, but that the veni&s;on was over done. All this, however, procured the poor creature no invitation, and he was not yet &s;ufficiently hardened to &s;tay without being a&s;ked; wherefore, finding the gentleman of the hou&s;e in&s;en&s;ible to all his fetches, he thought proper, at la&s;t, to retire, and mend his appetite by a walk in the Park.</P>
<P>You then, O ye beggars of my acquaintance, whether in rags or lace; whether in Kent-&s;treet or the Mall; whether at the Smyrna or St. Giles's, might I advi&s;e as a friend, never &s;eem in want of the favour which you &s;olicit. Apply to every pa&s;&s;ion but pity, for redre&s;s. You may find re|lief from vanity, from &s;elf-intere&s;t, or from ava|rice, but &s;eldom from compa&s;&s;ion. The very eloquence of a poor man is di&s;gu&s;ting; and that
<PB N="73" REF="74">
mouth which is opened even for flattery, is &s;eldom expected to clo&s;e without a petition.</P>
<P>If then you would ward off the gripe of poverty, pretend to be a &s;tranger to her, and &s;he will at lea&s;t u&s;e you with ceremony. Hear not my ad|vice, but that of Offellus. If you be caught din|ing upon a halfpenny porrenger of pea&s;e &s;oup and potatoes, prai&s;e the whole&s;omene&s;s of your frugal repa&s;t. You may ob&s;erve, that Dr. Cheyne has pre&s;cribed pea&s;e broth for the gravel, hint that you are not one of tho&s;e who are always making a god of your belly. If you are obliged to wear a flim&s;y &s;tuff in the mid&s;t of winter, be the fir&s;t to remark that &s;tuffs are very much worn at Paris.

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF HYPASIA.</HEAD>
<P>MAN, when &s;ecluded from &s;ociety, is not a more &s;olitary being than the woman who leaves the duties of her own &s;ex to invade the privileges of ours. She &s;eems, in &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances, like one in bani&s;hment; &s;he appears like a neutral being between the &s;exes; and tho' &s;he may have the admiration of both, &s;he finds true happine&s;s from neither.</P>
<P>Of all the ladies of antiquity, I have read of none who was ever more ju&s;tly celebrated than the beautiful Hypa&s;ia, the daughter of Leon the philo&s;opher. This mo&s;t accompli&s;hed of women was born at Alexandria, in the reign of Theodo|&s;ius the younger. Nature was never more lavi&s;h of its gifts than it had been to her, endued as &s;he was with the mo&s;t exalted under&s;tanding, and the happie&s;t turn to &s;cience. Education compleated what nature had begun, and made her the prodigy not only of her age, but the glory of her &s;ex.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="77">From her father &s;he learned geometry and a&s;tronomy; &s;he collected from the conver&s;ation and &s;chools of the other philo&s;ophers, for which Alexandria was at that time famous, the principles of the re&s;t of the &s;ciences.</P>
<P>What cannot be conquered by natural penetra|tion and a pa&s;&s;ion for &s;tudy? The boundle&s;s know|ledge which at that period of time was required to form the character of a philo&s;opher no way di&s;|couraged her; &s;he delivered her&s;elf up to the &s;tudy of Ari&s;totle and Plato, and &s;oon not one in all Alexandria under&s;tood &s;o perfectly as &s;he, all the difficulties of the&s;e two philo&s;ophers.</P>
<P>But not their &s;y&s;tems alone, but tho&s;e of every other &s;ect were quite familiar to her; and to this knowledge &s;he added that of polite learning, and the art of oratory. All the learning which it was po&s;&s;ible for the human mind to contain, being joined to a mo&s;t enchanting eloquence, rendered this lady the wonder not only of the populace, who ea&s;ily admire, but of philo&s;ophers them&s;elves, who are &s;eldom fond of admiration.</P>
<P>The city of Alexandria was every day crowded with &s;trangers, who came from all parts of Greece and A&s;ia to &s;ee and hear her. As for the charms of her per&s;on, they might not probably have been mentioned, did &s;he not join to a beauty the mo&s;t
<PB N="77" REF="78">
&s;triking, a virtue that might repre&s;s the mo&s;t a&s;|&s;uming; and though in the whole capital, famed for charms, there was not one who could equal her in beauty; though in a city, the re&s;ort of all the learning then exi&s;ting in the world, there was not one who could equal her in knowledge; yet, with &s;uch accompli&s;hments, Hypa&s;ia was the mo&s;t mode&s;t of her &s;ex. Her reputation for vir|tue was not le&s;s than her virtues; and though, in a city divided between two factions, though vi&s;ited by the wits and the philo&s;ophers of the age, calumny never dared to &s;u&s;pect her morals, or attempt her character. Both the Chri&s;tians and the Heathens who have tran&s;mitted her hi&s;tory and her misfortunes, have but one voice, when they &s;peak of her beauty, her knowledge, and her virtue. Nay, &s;o much harmony reigns in their accounts of this prodigy of perfection, that, in &s;pite of the oppo&s;ition of their faith, we &s;hould never have been able to judge of what religion was Hypa&s;ia, were we not informed, from other circum&s;tances, that &s;he was an heathen. Pro|vidence had taken &s;o much pains in forming her, that we are almo&s;t induced to complain of its not having endeavoured to make her a Chri&s;tian; but from this complaint we are deterred by a thou&s;and contrary ob&s;ervations, which lead us to reverence its in&s;crutable my&s;teries.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="79">This great reputation which &s;he &s;o ju&s;tly was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, was at la&s;t, however, the occa&s;ion of her ruin.</P>
<P>The per&s;on who then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the patriarchate of Alexandria was equally remarkable for his vio|lence, cruelty, and pride. Conducted by an ill-grounded zeal for the Chri&s;tian religion, or per|haps de&s;irous of augmenting his authority in the city, he had long meditated the bani&s;hment of the Jews. A difference ari&s;ing between them and the Chri&s;tians with re&s;pect to &s;ome public games, &s;eemed to him a proper juncture for putting his ambitious de&s;igns into execution. He found no difficulty in exciting the people, naturally di&s;po&s;ed to revolt. The prefect, who at that time com|manded the city, interpo&s;ed on this occa&s;ion, and thought it ju&s;t to put one of the chief creatures of the patriarch to the torture, in order to di&s;cover the fir&s;t promoter of the con&s;piracy. The pa|triarch, enraged at the inju&s;tice he thought of|fered to his character and dignity, and piqued at the protection which was offered to the Jews, &s;ent for the chiefs of the &s;ynagogue, and enjoined them to renounce their de&s;igns, upon pain of in|curring his highe&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The Jews, far from fearing his menaces, excited new tumults, in which &s;everal citizens had the misfortune to fall. The patriarch could no longer
<PB N="79" REF="80">
contain; at the head of a numerous body of Chri&s;tians, he flew to the &s;ynagogues, which he demoli&s;hed, and drove the Jews from a city, of which they had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ince the times of Alexander the great. It may be ea&s;ily imagined that the perfect could not behold, without pain, his juri&s;diction thus in&s;ulted, and the city deprived of a number of its mo&s;t indu&s;trious inhabitants.</P>
<P>The affair was therefore brought before the em|peror. The patriarch complained of the exce&s;&s;es of the Jews, and the prefect of the outrages of the patriarch. At this very juncture, five hun|dred monks of mount Nitria, imagining the life of their chief to be in danger, and that their religion was threatened in his fall, flew into the city with ungovernable rage, attacked the prefect in the &s;treets, and not content with loading him with reproaches, wounded him in &s;everal places.</P>
<P>The citizens had by this time notice of the fury of the monks; they, therefore, a&s;&s;embled in a body, put the monks to flight, &s;eized on him who had been found throwing a &s;tone, and de|livered him to the prefect, who cau&s;ed him to be put to death without farther delay.</P>
<P>The patriarch immediately ordered the dead body, which had been expo&s;ed to view, to be taken down, procured for it all the pomp and
<PB N="80" REF="81">
rites of burial, and went even &s;o far as him&s;elf to pronounce the funeral oration, in which he cla&s;&s;ed a &s;editious monk among the martyrs. This conduct was by no means generally approved of; the mo&s;t moderate even among the Chri&s;tians per|ceived and blamed his indi&s;cretion; but he was now too far advanced to retire. He had made &s;e|veral overtures towards a reconciliation with the prefect, which not &s;ucceeding, he bore all tho&s;e an implacable hatred whom he imagined to have any hand in traver&s;ing his de&s;igns; but Hypa&s;ia was particularly de&s;tined to ruin. She could not find pardon, as &s;he was known to have a mo&s;t re|fined friend&s;hip for the prefect; wherefore the po|pulace were incited again&s;t her. <HI>Peter,</HI> a reader of the principal church, one of tho&s;e vile &s;laves by which men in power are too frequently attend|ed, wretches ever ready to commit any crime which they hope may render them agreeable to their employer; this fellow, I &s;ay, attended by a crowd of villains, waited for Hypa&s;ia, as &s;he was returning from a vi&s;it, at her own door, &s;eized her as &s;he was going in, and dragged her to one of the churches called Ce&s;area, where, &s;tripping her in the mo&s;t inhuman manner, they exerci&s;ed the mo&s;t inhuman cruelties upon her, cut her into pieces, and burnt her remains to a&s;hes. Such was the end of Hypa&s;ia, the glory of her own &s;ex, and the a&s;toni&s;hment of ours.</P>

<HEAD>ON JUSTICE AND GENEROSITY.</HEAD>
<P>LYSIPPUS is a man who&s;e greatne&s;s of &s;oul the whole world admires. His gene|ro&s;ity is &s;uch, that it prevents a demand, and &s;aves the receiver the trouble and the confu&s;ion of a reque&s;t. His liberality al&s;o does not oblige more by its greatne&s;s, than by his inimitable grace in giving. Sometimes he even di&s;tributes his bounties to &s;trangers, and has been known to do good offices to tho&s;e who profe&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves his enemies. All the world are unani|mous in the prai&s;e of his genero&s;ity; there is only one &s;ort of people, who complain of his conduct. Ly&s;ippus does not pay his debts.</P>
<P>It is no difficult matter to account for a con|duct &s;o &s;eemingly incompatible with it&s;elf. There is greatne&s;s in being generous, and there is only &s;imple ju&s;tice in &s;atisfying his creditors. Gene|ro&s;ity is the part of a &s;oul rai&s;ed above the vulgar. There is in it &s;omething of what we admire in
<PB N="82" REF="83">
heroes, and prai&s;e with a degree of rapture. Ju&s;tice, on the contrary, is a mere mechanic virtue, only fit for trade&s;men, and what is prac|ti&s;ed by every broker in Change Alley.</P>
<P>In paying his debts a man barely does his duty, and it is an action attended with no &s;ort of glory. Should Ly&s;ippus &s;atisfy his creditors, who would be at the pains of telling it to the world. Ge|nero&s;ity is a virtue of a very different complexion. It is rai&s;ed above duty, and from its elevation attracts the attention, and the prai&s;es of us little mortals below.</P>
<P>In this manner do men generally rea&s;on upon ju&s;tice and genero&s;ity. The fir&s;t is de&s;pi&s;ed, though a virtue e&s;&s;ential to the good of &s;ociety, and the other attracts our e&s;teem, which too frequently proceeds from an impetuo&s;ity of tem|per, rather directed by vanity than rea&s;on. Ly|&s;ippus is told that his banker a&s;ks a debt of forty pounds, and that a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed acquaintance peti|tions for the &s;ame &s;um. He gives it without he&s;itating to the latter; for he demands as a fa|vour what the former requires as a debt.</P>
<P>Mankind in general are not &s;ufficiently ac|quainted with the import of the word Ju&s;tice: It is commonly believed to con&s;i&s;t only in a per|formance of tho&s;e duties to which the laws of
<PB N="83" REF="84">
&s;ociety can oblige us. This I allow is &s;ometimes the import of the word, and in this &s;en&s;e ju&s;tice is di&s;tingui&s;hed from equity; but there is a ju&s;tice &s;till more exten&s;ive, and which can be &s;hewn to embrace all the virtues united.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tice may be defined, that virtue which im|pels us to give to every per&s;on what is his due. In this extended &s;en&s;e of the word, it comprehends the practice of every virtue which rea&s;on pre|&s;cribes, or &s;ociety &s;hould expect. Our duty to our maker, to each other, and to our&s;elves, are fully an&s;wered, if we give them what we owe them. Thus ju&s;tice, properly &s;peaking, is the only virtue, and all the re&s;t have their origin in it.</P>
<P>The qualities of candour, fortitude, charity, and genero&s;ity, for in&s;tance, are not in their own nature, virtues; and, if ever they de&s;erve the title, it is owing only to ju&s;tice, which impels and directs them. Without &s;uch a moderator, candour might become indi&s;cretion, fortitude ob&s;tinacy, charity imprudence, and genero&s;ity mi&s;taken profu&s;ion.</P>
<P>A di&s;intere&s;ted action, if it be not conducted by ju&s;tice, is at be&s;t indifferent in its nature, and not unfrequently even turns to vice. The ex|pences of &s;ociety, of pre&s;ents, of entertainments,
<PB N="84" REF="85">
and the other helps to chearfulne&s;s, are actions merely indifferent, when not repugnant to a better method of di&s;po&s;ing of our &s;uperfluities, but they become vicious when they ob&s;truct or exhau&s;t our abilities from a more virtuous di&s;po&s;i|tion of our circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>True genero&s;ity is a duty as indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;|&s;ary as tho&s;e impo&s;ed upon us by law. It is a rule impo&s;ed upon us by rea&s;on, which &s;hould be the &s;overeign law of a rational being. But this genero&s;ity does not con&s;i&s;t in obeying every im|pul&s;e of humanity, in following blind pa&s;&s;ion for our guide, and impairing our circum&s;tances by pre&s;ent benefactions, &s;o as to render us incapable of future ones.</P>
<P>Mi&s;ers are generally characterized as men without honour, or without humanity, who live only to accumulate, and to this pa&s;&s;ion &s;acrifice every other happine&s;s. They have been de&s;cribed as madmen, who, in the mid&s;t of abundance, bani&s;h every plea&s;ure, and make, from imaginary wants, real nece&s;&s;ities. But few, very few, cor|re&s;pond to this exaggerated picture; and, perhaps, there is not one in whom all the&s;e circum&s;tances are found united. In&s;tead of this, we find the &s;ober and the indu&s;trious branded by the vain and the idle, with this odious appellation. Men who, by frugality and labour, rai&s;e them&s;elves above
<PB N="85" REF="86">
their equals, and contribute their &s;hare of in|du&s;try to the common &s;tock.</P>
<P>Whatever the vain or the ignorant may &s;ay, well were it for &s;ociety had we more of this cha|racter among&s;t us. In general, the&s;e clo&s;e men are found at la&s;t the true benefactors of &s;ociety. With an avaricious man we &s;eldom lo&s;e in our dealings, but too frequently in our commerce with prodigality.</P>
<P>A French prie&s;t, who&s;e name was Godinot, went for a long time by the name of the Griper. He refu&s;ed to relieve the mo&s;t apparent wretched|ne&s;s, and by a &s;kilful management of his vine|yard, had the good fortune to acquire immen&s;e &s;ums of money. The inhabitants of Rheims, who were his fellow-citizens, dete&s;ted him, and the populace, who &s;eldom love a mi&s;er, wherever he went, received him with contempt. He &s;till, however, continued his former &s;implicity of life, his amazing and unremitted frugality. This good man had long perceived the wants of the poor in the city, particularly, in having no water but what they were obliged to buy at an advanced price; wherefore, that whole fortune, which he had been ama&s;&s;ing, he laid out in an aqueduct, by which he did the poor more u&s;eful and la&s;ting &s;ervice, than if he had di&s;tributed his whole in|come in charity every day at his door.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="87">Among men long conver&s;ant with books, we too frequently find tho&s;e mi&s;placed virtues, of which I have been now complaining. We find the &s;tudious animated with a &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion, for the great virtues, as they are mi&s;takenly called, and utterly forgetful of the ordinary ones. The declamations of philo&s;ophy are generally rather exhau&s;ted on the&s;e &s;upererogatory duties, than on &s;uch as are indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary. A man, therefore, who has taken his ideas of mankind from &s;tudy alone, generally comes into the world with an heart melting at every fictitious di&s;tre&s;s. Thus he is induced by mi&s;placed liberality, to put him&s;elf into the indigent circum&s;tances of the per&s;on he relieves.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this paper with the advice of one of the Ancients, to a young man, whom he &s;aw giving away all his &s;ub&s;tance to pretended di&s;tre&s;s. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is po&s;&s;ible, that the per&s;on you relieve, may be an hone&s;t man; and I know, that you, who relieve him, are &s;uch.

<P>WIT &s;eems to be one of tho&s;e undetermined &s;ounds to which we affix &s;carce any preci&s;e idea. It is &s;omething more than judgment, ge|nius, ta&s;te, talent, penetration, grace, delicacy, and yet it partakes &s;omewhat of each. It may be properly defined ingenious rea&s;on. It is one of tho&s;e general terms which always want another word to determine their &s;ignification; and when we hear &s;uch a work prai&s;ed for being witty, &s;uch a man applauded for wit, it is but ju&s;t to a&s;k of what &s;ort</P>
<P>Thus Corneille with &s;ublimity, and Boileau with exactne&s;s; Fontaine with &s;implicity, and Bruyere by being natural, are all reckoned men of wit, yet each differs from the other; and &s;till more from &s;ome philo&s;ophers, who may be ac|counted witty men, who join &s;agacity to imagina|tion.</P>
<P>They who de&s;pi&s;e the Genius of Ari&s;totle (in|&s;tead of being contented with rejecting his Phy&s;ics
<PB N="88" REF="89">
only, which cannot be good, as he had but few experiments to direct them) will be much &s;ur|prized to find in his rhetoric the manner of &s;aying things wittily. He informs us there, that the art does not con&s;i&s;t in &s;imply u&s;ing the proper term, which offers to the imagination nothing new. We ought, &s;ays he, rather to employ a metaphor, or a figure, the &s;en&s;e of which mu&s;t be clear, and the expre&s;&s;ion energetic.</P>
<P>Of this he gives &s;everal examples, and, among others, the expre&s;&s;ion of Pericles, in talking of a battle in which the mo&s;t beautiful of the youth of Athens were &s;lain, <HI>The year has been deprived of its &s;pring.</HI> He adds, that the thought al&s;o &s;hould have the grace of novelty. The per&s;on who fir&s;t, to expre&s;s how plea&s;ures were generally attended with pain, made u&s;e of the &s;imile of ro&s;es being gathered among thorns, had wit. But it is otherwi&s;e with tho&s;e who repeat it after him.</P>
<P>But a metaphor is not always the wittie&s;t man|ner of expre&s;&s;ing a thing with &s;pirit, a great deal con&s;i&s;ts in an unexpected turn, in leaving us to under&s;tand, without trouble, a part of the poet's meaning. This is &s;o much the more plea&s;ing, as it &s;eems an indirect compliment to the reader, and &s;hews his wit, as well as that of the Poet. Allu|&s;ion, allegory, compari&s;on, each furni&s;hes an ex|ten&s;ive field of ingenuity; hi&s;tory, fable, and the
<PB N="89" REF="90">
effects of nature, furni&s;h matter to a well-regulated imagination, that can never be exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>Let us then con&s;ider in what Places wit &s;hould be admitted. It &s;eems pretty manife&s;t, that, in works of dignity, it &s;hould be u&s;ed with caution, as it is only, at be&s;t, an ornament. The great art is in the proper timing this ornament. A fine thought, a ju&s;t or elegant compari&s;on, are faults, when rea&s;on only, or when pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould &s;peak, and particularly where the &s;ubject is intere&s;ting. U&s;ing it in &s;uch circum&s;tances as the&s;e, &s;hould not be called fal&s;e wit (as Addi&s;on commonly expre&s;&s;es it;) but wit di&s;placed, and every mi&s;placed beauty is rather a defect. This is a fault in which Virgil never tran&s;gre&s;&s;es, and with which Ta&s;&s;o may be &s;ometimes reproached, all admirable as he is at other times. This error generally ari&s;es from an author's exuberance; filled with ideas of different kinds, he is de&s;irous of &s;hewing him&s;elf, when he ought only to exhibit his per&s;onages. The be&s;t method of knowing the true u&s;e to be made of wit is, by reading the &s;mall number of good works, both in the learned languages, and in our own.</P>
<P>Fal&s;e wit, as I have already hinted, is very dif|ferent from di&s;placed wit. This is not only a fal&s;e thought, but it is generally far-fetched al&s;o. A man of &s;ome wit, who formerly abridged
<PB N="90" REF="91">
Homer in French ver&s;e, imagined he added beau|ties to the old &s;imple bard, in &s;ometimes lending him embelli&s;hments. On the reconciling Achilles with Agamemnon, he thus flouri&s;hes it:
<Q><LG>
<L>Tout le camp s'ecria dans une joie extr&egrave;me</L>
<L>Que ne vaincra t-il point? Il s'e&s;t vaincu lui m&ecirc;me!</L>

<L>The &s;houting army cry'd with joy extreme,</L>
<L>He &s;ure mu&s;t conquer, who him&s;elf can tame!</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>His taming him&s;elf does by no means imply his conquering others; but this is not the ab&s;urdity alone, but in making the army, as if by in|&s;piration, join in a far-fetched ob&s;ervation. If this &s;hocks the reader of nice di&s;cernment, how much more &s;o mu&s;t all tho&s;e forced expre&s;|&s;ions, cold yet &s;tiffened allu&s;ions, and bloated nothings di&s;plea&s;e, which are found in great plenty in works of otherwi&s;e real merit. How can we bear to hear a mathematician &s;ay, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If Saturn &s;hould happen to be removed, the remote&s;t of his &s;atellites would probably take his place, &s;ince great princes always keep their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors at a di&s;tance."</Q> It is intolerable, when &s;peaking of Hercules under&s;tanding phy&s;icks, to &s;ay that there was no re&s;i&s;ting a philo&s;opher of his force. The de&s;ire of &s;parkling and &s;urpri&s;ing is too fre|quently the cau&s;e of exce&s;&s;es of this kind.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="92">This trifling vanity has al&s;o produced the play|ing upon words in every language, which is the wor&s;t &s;ort of fal&s;e wit.</P>
<P>Fal&s;e ta&s;te is very different from fal&s;e wit, as the latter always proceeds from affectation, from an effort to go wrong; on the contrary, the other is an habit of going wrong without de&s;ign, and fol|lowing, as if by in&s;tinct, &s;ome bad, though e&s;ta|bli&s;hed model. The incoherent exuberance of an oriental imagination is a fal&s;e ta&s;te, and an im|proper example to imitate: however, they more frequently tran&s;gre&s;s in this re&s;pect, rather from a poverty than a copiou&s;ne&s;s of real genius. Falling &s;tars, &s;plitting mountains, rivers flowing to their &s;ources, the &s;un and moon di&s;&s;olving, fal&s;e and un|natural compari&s;ons, and nature every where ex|aggerated, form the character of the&s;e writers; and this ari&s;es from their never, in the&s;e countries, being permitted to &s;peak in public. True elo|quence has never been cultivated there, and it is much ea&s;ier to write in a turgid &s;train, than with ea&s;e and delicate &s;implicity.</P>
<P>In a word, fal&s;e wit is entirely the oppo&s;ite of the Ea&s;tern manner; the man of fal&s;e wit de&s;ires to &s;ay in riddles, what others have &s;poken natu|rally. He de&s;ires to unite ideas the mo&s;t incom|patible, to divide tho&s;e which nature has united. To catch unnatural &s;imilitudes, without di&s;cretion
<PB N="92" REF="93">
to unite plea&s;antry with what is &s;erious, to mix great and little images together, and to confu&s;e in&s;tead of &s;atisfying the imagination.</P>
<P>But per&s;picuity is not the only part of &s;tile in which fal&s;e wit is not con&s;picuous, we are at the &s;ame time too fond of embelli&s;hment. In our mo&s;t applauded productions there is &s;carce a &s;en|tence which is not loaded with unnece&s;&s;ary orna|ment, which, though it may add grace to a pe|riod, generally di&s;unites the force of a paragraph. The attention, as in Gothic architecture is &s;plit upon a number of minute elegances, which, though each are &s;eparately pretty, dimini&s;h the force of the whole.</P>
<P>The&s;e are faults that &s;eem to characterize the writings of the age; to the&s;e every author who would be admired mu&s;t conform. With the&s;e faults he is &s;ure of immediate applau&s;e, though frequently &s;carce allowed a reading. We have &s;een many a writer, of late, make his appearance with the&s;e qualifications, in&s;tead of merit; we have &s;een him read by a few, prai&s;ed by all, and &s;oon forgotten.</P>
<P>I have been often at a lo&s;s, whether to a&s;cribe the decline of ta&s;te in a nation, to the reader or the writer. Perhaps both are in fault; the one &s;atiated with varied in&s;tances of perfection, grows
<PB N="93" REF="94">
whim&s;ical, de&s;ires &s;omething new, and mi&s;takes change for improvement. The other, willing to avoid the character of an imitator, borrows peculiarities from affectation, and becomes origi|nal only in trifles. In &s;hort, it is as difficult now among &s;uch a number of candidates, to catch the attention without the&s;e oddities of &s;tile, as to be remarkable in a crowd without &s;ome pe|culiarity in dre&s;s and behaviour.</P>
<P>But the&s;e are generally fleeting modes, which are introduced by the great, brought up to plea&s;e for a day, &s;oon to be di&s;placed by others, which have the advantages of being more new to recom|mend them. The literary republic, however, will never &s;uffer real injury from &s;uch; for what|ever plea&s;es from its novelty alone, can never plea&s;e long. Not from the&s;e, then, but from the compilers and commentators of the day, is literature to expect the mortal blow; from pe|dants, who have no claim but their indu&s;try for our applau&s;e; from laborious drones, who write through folios, but do not think through a page.</P>

<P>THE Spani&s;h nation has, for many centuries pa&s;t, been remarkable for the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ig|norance in polite literature, e&s;pecially in point of natural philo&s;ophy; a &s;cience &s;o u&s;eful to man|kind, that her neighbours have ever e&s;teemed it a matter of the greate&s;t importance, to endea|vour, by repeated experiments, to &s;trike a light out of the chaos, in which truth &s;eemed to be confounded. Their curio&s;ity, in this re&s;pect, was &s;o indifferent, that, though they had di&s;|covered new worlds, they were at a lo&s;s to ex|plain the phoenomena of their own, and their pride &s;o unaccountable, that they di&s;dained to borrow from others that in&s;truction, which their natural indolence permitted them not to acquire.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="97">It gives me, however, a &s;ecret &s;atisfaction, to behold an extraordinary genius now exi&s;ting in that nation, who&s;e &s;tudious endeavours &s;eem cal|culated to undeceive the &s;uper&s;titious, and in&s;truct the ignorant: I mean the celebrated Padre Freijo. In unravelling the my&s;teries of nature, and ex|plaining phy&s;ical experiments, he takes an oppor|tunity of di&s;playing the concurrence of &s;econd cau&s;es, in tho&s;e very wonders which the vulgar a&s;cribe to &s;uper-natural influence.</P>
<P>An example of this kind happened a few years ago, in a &s;mall town of the Kingdom of Valencia. Pa&s;&s;ing through at the hour of ma&s;s, he alighted from his mule, and proceeded to the pari&s;h-church, which he found extremely crouded, and there ap|peared on the faces of the faithful a more than u&s;ual alacrity. The &s;un, it &s;eems, which had been for &s;ome minutes under a cloud, had begun to &s;hine on a large crucifix, that &s;tood on the middle of the altar, &s;tudded with &s;everal precious &s;tones. The reflexion from the&s;e, and from the diamond eyes of &s;ome &s;ilver &s;aints, &s;o dazzed the multitude, that they unanimou&s;ly cried out, A miracle! a miracle! whil&s;t the prie&s;t at the altar, with &s;eem|ing con&s;ternation, continued his heavenly conver|&s;ation. Padre Freijo &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated the charm, by tying his handkerchief round the head of one of the &s;tatues, for which he was arraigned by the inqui&s;ition; who&s;e flames, however, he has had the good fortune hitherto to e&s;cape.</P>

<HEAD>MISCELLANEOUS.</HEAD>
<P>_WERE I to mea&s;ure the merit of my pre&s;ent undertaking by its &s;uc|ce&s;s, or the rapidity of its &s;ale, I might be led to form conclu&s;ions by no means favourable to the pride of an author. Should I e&s;timate my fame by its extent, every News-Paper and every Ma|gazine would leave me far behind. Their fame is diffu&s;ed in a very wide circle, that of &s;ome as far as I&s;lington, and &s;ome yet farther &s;till; while mine, I &s;incerely believe, has hardly travelled be|yond the &s;ound of Bow-bell; and while the works of others fly like unpinioned &s;wans, I find my own move as heavily as a new-plucked goo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="99">Still, however, I have as much pride as they who have ten times as many readers. It is im|po&s;&s;ible to repeat all the agreeable delu&s;ions in which a di&s;appointed author is apt to find com|fort. I conclude, that what my reputation wants in extent, is made up by its &s;olidity. <HI>Minus juvat Gloria lata quam magna.</HI> I have great &s;ati&s;|faction in con&s;idering the delicacy and di&s;cernment of tho&s;e readers I have, and in a&s;cribing my want of popularity to the ignorance or inattention of tho&s;e I have not. All the world may for&s;ake an au|thor, but vanity will never for&s;ake him.</P>
<P>Yet notwith&s;tanding &s;o &s;incere a confe&s;&s;ion, I was once induced to &s;hew my indignation again&s;t the public, by di&s;continuing my endeavours to plea&s;e; and was bravely re&s;olved, like Raleigh, to vex them, by burning my manu&s;cript in a pa&s;&s;ion. Upon recollection, however, I con&s;idered what &s;et or body of people would be di&s;plea&s;ed at my ra&s;hne&s;s. The &s;un, after &s;o &s;ad an accident, might &s;hine next morning as bright as u&s;ual; men might laugh and &s;ing the next day, and tran&s;act bu&s;ine&s;s as before, and not a &s;ingle creature feel any regret but my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I reflected upon the &s;tory of a mini&s;ter, who, in the reign of Charles II. upon a certain occa|&s;ion, re&s;igned all his po&s;ts, and retired into the country in a fit of re&s;entment. But as he had not
<PB N="99" REF="100">
given the world entirely up with his ambition, he &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to town, to &s;ee how the courtiers would bear his re&s;ignation. Upon the me&s;&s;enger's return, he was a&s;ked whether there appeared any commotions at court? To which he replied, There were very great ones. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ay, &s;ays the mini&s;ter, I knew my friends would make a bu&s;tle; all petitioning the king for my re&s;toration, I pre&s;ume."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No, Sir, replied the me&s;&s;enger, they are only petitioning his maje&s;ty to be put in your place."</Q> In the &s;ame manner, &s;hould I retire in indignation, in&s;tead of having Apollo in mourning, or the Mu&s;es in a fit of the &s;pleen; in&s;tead of having the learned world apo&s;trophi&s;ing at my untimely decea&s;e, per|haps all Grub-&s;treet might laugh at my fall, and &s;elf-approving dignity might never be able to &s;hield me from ridicule. In &s;hort, I am re&s;olved to write on, if it were only to &s;pite them. If the pre&s;ent generation will not hear my voice, hearken, O po&s;terity, to you I call, and from you I expect redre&s;s! What rapture will it not give to have the Scaligers, Daciers, and Warbur|tons of future times commenting with admiration upon every line I now write, working away tho&s;e ignorant creatures who offer to arraign my merit with all the virulence of learned reproach. Ay, my friends, let them feel it; call names; never &s;pare them; they de&s;erve it all, and ten times more. I have been told of a critic, who was crucified, at the
<PB N="100" REF="101">
command of another, to the reputation of Ho|mer. That, no doubt, was more than poetical ju&s;tice, and I &s;hall be perfectly content if tho&s;e who critici&s;e me are only clapped in the pillory, kept fifteen days upon bread and water, and obliged to run the gantlope through Pater no&s;ter Row. The truth is, I can expect happine&s;s from po&s;te|rity either way. If I write ill, happy in being forgotten; if well, happy in being remembered with re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Yet, con&s;idering things in a prudential light, per|haps I was mi&s;taken in de&s;igning my paper as an agreeable relaxation to the &s;tudious, or an help to conver&s;ation among the gay; in&s;tead of addre&s;&s;ing it to &s;uch, I &s;hould have written down to the ta&s;te and apprehen&s;ion of the many, and &s;ought for reputation on the broad road. Literary fame I now find like religious, generally begins among the vulgar. As for the polite, they are &s;o very polite, as never to applaud upon any ac|count. One of the&s;e, with a face &s;crewed up into affectation, tells you, that fools may <HI>admire,</HI> but men of &s;en&s;e only <HI>approve.</HI> Thus, le&s;t he &s;hould ri&s;e into rapture at any thing new, he keeps down every pa&s;&s;ion but pride and &s;elf-im|portance; approves with phlegm, and the poor author is damned in the taking a pinch of &s;nuff. Another has written a book him&s;elf, and being condemned for a dunce, he turns a &s;ort of king's
<PB N="101" REF="102">
evidence in critici&s;m, and now becomes the terror of every offender. A third, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of full-grown reputation, &s;hades off every beam of favour from tho&s;e who endeavour to grow beneath him, and keeps down that merit, which, but for his influence, might ri&s;e into equal eminence. While others, &s;till wor&s;e, peru&s;e old books for their amu&s;ement, and new books only to condemn; &s;o that the public &s;eem heartily &s;ick of all but the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day, and read every thing new with as little attention as they examine the faces of the pa&s;&s;ing crowd.</P>
<P>From the&s;e con&s;iderations I was once determined to throw off all connexions with ta&s;te, and fairly addre&s;s my countrymen in the &s;ame engaging &s;tyle and manner with other periodical pamphlets, much more in vogue than probably mine &s;hall ever be. To effect this, I had thoughts of changing the title into that of the ROYAL BEE, the ANTI-GALLICAN BEE, or the BEE's MAGAZINE. I had laid in a proper &s;tock of popular topicks, &s;uch as encomiums on the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, invec|tives again&s;t the queen of Hungary and the French, the nece&s;&s;ity of a militia, our undoubted &s;ove|reignty of the &s;eas, reflections upon the pre&s;ent &s;tate of affairs, a di&s;&s;ertation upon liberty, &s;ome &s;ea&s;onable thoughts upon the intended bridge of Black-friars, and an addre&s;s to Britons. The hi&s;tory of an old woman, who&s;e teeth grew three inches

All this, together with four extraor|dinary pages of <HI>letter pre&s;s,</HI> a beautiful map of England, and two prints curiou&s;ly coloured from nature, I fancied might touch their very &s;ouls. I was actually beginning an addre&s;s to the people, when my pride at la&s;t overcame my prudence, and determined me to endeavour to plea&s;e by the goodne&s;s of my entertainment, rather than by the magnificence of my &s;ign.</P>
<P>The Spectator, and many &s;ucceeding e&s;&s;ayi&s;ts, frequently inform us of the numerous compli|ments paid them in the cour&s;e of their lucubra|tions; of the frequent encouragements they met to in&s;pire them with ardour, and increa&s;e their eagerne&s;s to plea&s;e. I have received <HI>my letters</HI> as well as they; but alas! not congratulatory ones; not a&s;&s;uring me of &s;ucce&s;s and favour; but pregnant with bodings that might &s;hake even fortitude it&s;elf.</P>
<P>One gentleman a&s;&s;ures me, he intends to throw away no more three-pences in purcha&s;ing the BEE, and what is &s;till more di&s;mal, he will not recommend me as a poor author wanting encou|ragement to his neighbourbood, which it &s;eems is very numerous. Were my &s;oul &s;et upon three-pences, what anxiety might not &s;uch a denuncia|tion

<P>Others have di&s;liked the title and the motto of my paper, point out a mi&s;take in the one, and a&s;&s;ure me the other has been con&s;igned to dulne&s;s by anticipation. All this may be true; <HI>but what is that to me?</HI> Titles and mottoes to books are like e&s;cutcheons and dignities in the hands of a king. The wi&s;e &s;ometimes conde&s;cend to <HI>accept</HI> of them; but none but a fool will imagine them of any real importance. We ought to depend upon in|trin&s;ic merit, and not the &s;lender helps of title. <HI>Nam quae non fecimus ip&s;i, vix ea no&s;tra voco.</HI></P>
<P>For my part, I am ever ready to mi&s;tru&s;t a promi&s;ing title, and have, at &s;ome expence, been in&s;tructed not to hearken to the voice of an ad|verti&s;ement, let it plead never &s;o loudly, or never &s;o long. A countryman coming one day to Smithfield, in order to take a &s;lice of Bartholo|mew-fair, found a perfect &s;hew before every booth.

<HEAD>A FLEMISH TRADITION.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY country has its traditions, which, either too minute or not &s;ufficiently authentic to receive hi&s;torical &s;anction, are handed down among the vulgar, and &s;erve at once to in&s;truct and amu&s;e them. Of this number the adventures of Robin Hood, the hunting of Chevy chace, and the bravery of Johnny Arm&s;trong, among the Engli&s;h; of Kaul Dereg, among the Iri&s;h; and Creigton, among the Scots, are in&s;tances. Of all the traditions, however, I remember to have heard, I do not recollect any more remarkable than one &s;till current in Flanders; a &s;tory gene|rally the fir&s;t the pea&s;ants tell their children, when they bid them behave like Bidderman the wi&s;e. It is by no means, however, a model to be &s;et before a polite people for imitation; &s;ince if, on the one hand, we perceive in it the &s;teady influence of patrioti&s;m; we, on the other, find as &s;trong a de&s;ire of revenge. But, to wave introduction, let us to the &s;tory.</P>
<P>When the Saracens over-ran Europe with their armies, and penetrated as far even as Antwerp,</P>
<GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="2 pages">
<P><PB N="108" REF="107">The executioner was, therefore, the fir&s;t object of his re&s;entment, and he even practi&s;ed the lowe&s;t fraud to gratify the revenge he owed him. A piece of plate, which Biddeman had previou&s;ly &s;tolen from the Saracen governor, he privately conveyed into the executioner's hou&s;e, and then gave informa|tion of the theft. They who are any way ac|quainted with the rigour of the Arabian laws, know that theft is puni&s;hed with immediate death. The proof was direct in this ca&s;e; the executioner had nothing to offer in his own defence, and he was therefore condemned to be beheaded upon a &s;caffold in the public market place. As there was no executioner in the city but the very man who was now to &s;uffer, Bidderman him&s;elf un|dertook this, to him, mo&s;t agreeable office. The criminal was conducted from the judgment &s;eat, bound with cords. The &s;caffold was erected, and he placed in &s;uch a manner, as he might lie mo&s;t convenient for the blow.</P>
<P>But his death alone was not &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy the re&s;entment of this extraordinary man, unle&s;s it was aggravated with every circum&s;tance of cruelty. Wherefore, coming up the &s;caffold, and di&s;po&s;ing every thing in readine&s;s for the in|tended blow, with the &s;word in his hand he ap|proached the criminal, and whi&s;pering in a low voice, a&s;&s;ured him, that he him&s;elf was the very per&s;on that had once been u&s;ed with &s;o much
<PB N="109" REF="108">
cruelty; that to his knowledge, he died very in|nocently, for the plate had been &s;tolen by him|&s;elf, and privately conveyed into the hou&s;e of the other.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O, my countrymen, cried the criminal, do you hear what this man &s;ays?"</Q>&mdash;<HI>Does the villain murmur?</HI> replied Bidderman, and im|mediately, at one blow, &s;evered his head from his body.</P>
<P>Still, however, he was not content till he had ample vengeance, of the governors of the city, who condemned him. To effect this, he hired a &s;mall hou&s;e adjoining to the town wall, un|der which he every day dug, and carried out the earth in a ba&s;ket. In this unremitting labour, he continued &s;everal years, every day digging a little, and carrying the earth un&s;u&s;pected away. By this means he at la&s;t made a &s;ecret communi|cation from the country into the city, and only wanted the appearance of an enemy, in order to betray it. This opportunity, at length, offered; the French army came into the neighbourhood, but had no thoughts of &s;itting down before a town which they con&s;idered as impregnable. Bidderman, however, &s;oon altered their re&s;olu|tions, and, upon communicating his plan to the General, he embraced it with ardour. Through
<PB N="110" REF="109">
the private pa&s;&s;age above-mentioned, he intro|duced a large body of the mo&s;t re&s;olute &s;oldiers, who &s;oon opened the gates for the re&s;t, and the whole army ru&s;hing in, put every Saracen that was found to the &s;word.</P>

<HEAD>THE Sagacity of &s;ome INSECTS. To the AUTHOR of the BEE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ANIMALS, in general, are &s;agacious in proportion as they cultivate &s;ociety. The elephant and the beaver &s;hew the greate&s;t &s;igns of this when united; but when man intrudes into their communities, they lo&s;e all their &s;pirit of indu&s;try, and te&s;tify but a very &s;mall &s;hare of that &s;agacity, for which, when in a &s;ocial &s;tate, they are &s;o remarkable.</P>
<P>Among in&s;ects, the labours of the bee and the ant have employed the attention and admira|tion of the naturali&s;t; but their whole &s;agacity is lo&s;t upon &s;eparation, and a &s;ingle bee or ant, &s;eems de&s;titute of every degree of indu&s;try, is the mo&s;t &s;tupid in&s;ect imaginable, langui&s;hes for a time in &s;olitude, and &s;oon dies.</P>
<P>Of all the &s;olitary in&s;ects I have ever re|marked, the &s;pider is the mo&s;t &s;agacious, and its actions to me, who have attentively con&s;idered
<PB N="112" REF="111">
them, &s;eem almo&s;t to exceed belief. This in&s;ect is formed by nature for a &s;tate of war, not only upon other in&s;ects, but upon each other. For this &s;tate nature &s;eems perfectly well to have formed it. Its head and brea&s;t are covered with a &s;trong natural coat of mail, which is impenetra|ble to the attempts of every other in&s;ect, and its belly is inveloped in a &s;oft pliant &s;kin, which eludes the &s;ting even of a wa&s;p. Its legs are terminated by &s;trong claws, not unlike tho&s;e of a lob&s;ter, and their va&s;t length, like &s;pears, &s;erve to keep every a&s;&s;ailant at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Not wor&s;e furni&s;hed for ob&s;ervation than for an attack or a defence, it has &s;everal eyes, large, tran&s;parent, and covered with an horny &s;ub&s;tance, which, however, does not impede its vi&s;ion. Be&s;ides this, it is furni&s;hed with a forceps above the mouth, which &s;erves to kill or &s;ecure the prey already caught in its claws or its net.</P>
<P>Such are the implements of war with which the body is immediately furni&s;h'd; but its net to entangle the enemy &s;eems what it chiefly tru&s;ts to, and what it takes mo&s;t pains to render as complete as po&s;&s;ible. Nature has furni&s;hed the body of this little creature with a glutinous li|quid, which proceeding from the anus, it &s;pins into a thread coar&s;er or finer, as it chu&s;es to con|tract or dilate its &s;phincter. In order to fix its
<PB N="113" REF="112">
&s;phincter. In order to fix its thread when it be|gins to weave, it emits a &s;mall drop of its liquid again&s;t the wall, which hardening by degrees, &s;erves to hold the thread very firmly. Then re|ceding from the fir&s;t point, as it recedes the thread lengthens; and when the &s;pider has come to the place where the other end of the thread &s;hould be fixed, gathering up with its claws the thread which would otherwi&s;e be too &s;lack, it is &s;tretched tightly, and fixed in the &s;ame manner to the wall as before.</P>
<P>In this manner it &s;pins and fixes &s;everal threads parallel to each other, which, &s;o to &s;peak, &s;erve as the warp to the intended web. To form the woof, it &s;pins in the &s;ame manner its thread, tran&s;ver&s;ly fixing one end to the fir&s;t thread that was &s;pun, and which is always the &s;tronge&s;t of the whole web, and the other to the wall. All the&s;e threads, being newly &s;pun, are glutinous, and therefore &s;tick to each other wherever they happen to touch, and in tho&s;e parts of the web mo&s;t expo&s;ed to be torn, our natural arti&s;t &s;trengthens them, by doubling the threads &s;ome|times &s;ix fold.</P>
<P>Thus far naturali&s;ts have gone in the de&s;crip|tion of this animal; what follows is the re&s;ult of my own ob&s;ervation upon that &s;pecies of the in|&s;ect called an <HI>Hou&s;e-Spider.</HI> I perceived about
<PB N="114" REF="113">
four years ago, a large &s;pider in one corner of my room, making its web, and though the maid frequently levelled her fatal broom again&s;t the la|bours of the little animal, I had the good fortune then to prevent its de&s;truction, and I may &s;ay, it more than paid me by the entertainment it afforded.</P>
<P>In three days the web was with incredible dili|gence completed; nor could I avoid thinking that the in&s;ect &s;eemed to exult in its new abode. It frequently traver&s;ed it round, examined the &s;trength of every part of it, retired into its hole, and came out very frequently. The fir&s;t enemy, however, it had to encounter, was another and a much larger &s;pider, which, having no web of its own, and having probably exhau&s;ted all its &s;tock in former labours of this kind, came to invade the property of its neighbour. Soon then a terrible encounter en&s;ued, in which the invader &s;eemed to have the victory, and the laborious &s;pider was obliged to take refuge in its hole. Upon this I perceived the victor u&s;ing every art to draw the enemy from his &s;trong hold. He &s;eemed to go off, but quickly returned, and when he found all arts vain, began to demoli&s;h the new web without mercy. This brought on another battle, and, contrary to my expectations, the laborious &s;pider became conqueror, and fairly killed his antagoni&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="114">Now then, in peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what was ju&s;tly its own, it waited three days with the ut|mo&s;t patience, repairing the breaches of its web, and taking no &s;u&s;tenance that I could perceive. At la&s;t, however, a large blue fly fell into the &s;nare, and &s;truggled hard to get loo&s;e. The &s;pider gave it leave to entangle it&s;elf as much as po&s;&s;ible, but it &s;eemed to be too &s;trong for the cobweb. I mu&s;t own I was greatly &s;urprized when I &s;aw the &s;pider immediately &s;ally out, and in le&s;s than a minute weave a new net round its captive, by which the motion of its wings was &s;topped, and when it was fairly hampered in this manner, it was &s;eized, and dragged into the hole.</P>
<P>In this manner it lived, in a precarious &s;tate, and nature &s;eemed to have fitted it for &s;uch a life, for upon a &s;ingle fly it &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for more than a week. I once put a wa&s;p into the ne&s;t, but when the &s;pider came out in order to &s;eize it as u&s;ual, upon perceiving what kind of an enemy it had to deal with, it in&s;tantly broke all the bands that held it fa&s;t, and contributed all that lay in its power to di&s;engage &s;o formidable an antagoni&s;t. When the wa&s;p was at liberty, I expected the &s;pider would have &s;et about repairing the breaches that were made in its net, but tho&s;e it &s;eems were irreparable, wherefore the cobweb was now en|tirely
<PB N="116" REF="115">
for&s;aken, and a new one begun, which was completed in the u&s;ual time.</P>
<P>I had now a mind to try how many cobwebs a &s;ingle &s;pider could furni&s;h, wherefore I de&s;troyed this, and the in&s;ect &s;et about another. When I de&s;troyed the other al&s;o, its whole &s;tock &s;eemed entirely exhau&s;ted, and it could &s;pin no more. The arts it made u&s;e of to &s;upport it&s;elf, now deprived of its great means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, were indeed &s;urprizing. I have &s;een it roll up its legs like a ball, and lie motionle&s;s for hours together, but cautiou&s;ly watching all the time; when a fly happened to approach &s;ufficiently near, it would dart out all at once, and often &s;eize its prey.</P>
<P>Of this life, however, it &s;oon began to grow weary, and re&s;olved to invade the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome other &s;pider, &s;ince it could not make a web of its own. It formed an attack upon a neigh|bouring fortification with great vigour, and at fir&s;t was as vigorou&s;ly repul&s;ed. Not daunted, however, with one defeat, in this manner it continued to lay &s;iege to another's web for three days, and, at length, having killed the defendant, actually took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. When &s;maller flies hap|pen to fall into the &s;nare, the &s;pider does not &s;ally out at once, but very patiently waits till it is &s;ure of them; for, upon his immediately ap|proaching, the terror of his appearance might
<PB N="117" REF="116">
give the captive &s;trength &s;ufficient to get loo&s;e: The manner then is to wait patiently till, by in|effectual and impotent &s;truggles, the captive has wa&s;ted all its &s;trength, and then he becomes a certain and an ea&s;y conque&s;t.</P>
<P>The in&s;ect I am now de&s;cribing, lived three years; every year it changed its &s;kin, and got a new &s;et of legs. I have &s;ometimes plucked off a leg, which grew again in two or three days. At fir&s;t, it dreaded my approach to its web, but at la&s;t it became &s;o familiar as to take a fly out of my hand, and upon my touching any part of the web, would immediately leave its hole, pre|pared either for a defence or an attack.</P>
<P>To complete this de&s;cription, it may be ob|&s;erved, that the male &s;pider is much le&s;s than the female, and that the latter are oviparous. When they come to lay, they &s;pread a part of their web under the eggs, and then roll them up care|fully, as we roll up things in a cloth, and thus hatch them in their hole. If di&s;turbed in their holes, they never attempt to e&s;cape without car|rying this young brood in their forceps away with them, and thus frequently are &s;acrificed to their paternal affection.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as ever the young ones leave their ar|tificial covering, they begin to &s;pin, and almo&s;t
<PB N="118" REF="117">
&s;en&s;ibly &s;eem to grow bigger. If they have the good fortune, when even but a day old, to catch a fly, they fall too with good appetites; but they live &s;ometimes three of four days without any &s;ort of &s;u&s;tenance, and yet &s;till continue to grow larger, &s;o as every day to double their former &s;ize. As they grow old, however, they do not &s;till continue to encrea&s;e, but their legs only continue to grow longer; and when a &s;pider becomes en|tirely &s;tiff with age, and unable to &s;eize its prey, it dies at length of hunger.</P>

<P>IN every duty, in every &s;cience in which we would wi&s;h to arrive at perfection, we &s;hould propo&s;e for the object of our pur&s;uit &s;ome cer|tain &s;tation even beyond our abilities; &s;ome ima|ginary excellence, which may amu&s;e and &s;erve to animate our enquiry. In deviating from others, in following an unbeaten road, though we, perhaps, may never arrive at the wi&s;h'd-for object; yet it is po&s;&s;ible we may meet &s;everal di&s;|coveries by the way; and the certainty of &s;mall advantages, even while we travel with &s;ecurity, is not &s;o amu&s;ing as the hopes of great rewards, which in&s;pire the adventurer. <HI>Evenit nonnunquam,</HI> &s;ays Quintillian, <HI>ut aliquid grande inveniat qui &s;emper quaerit quod nimium e&s;t.</HI></P>

<PB N="120" REF="119">
upon philo&s;ophy, or an imitator in polite learning, might be regarded as a chimerical pro|jector. Hundreds would be ready not only to point out his errors, but to load him with re|proach. Our probable opinions are now regarded as certainties; the difficulties hitherto undi&s;covered, as utterly in&s;crutable; and the writers of the la&s;t age inimitable, and therefore the propere&s;t models of imitation.</P>
<P>One might be almo&s;t induced to deplore the philo&s;ophic &s;pirit of the age, which in proportion as it enlightens the mind, encrea&s;es its timidity, and repre&s;&s;es the vigour of every undertaking. Men are now content with being prudently in the right; which, though not the way to make new acqui&s;itions, it mu&s;t be owned, is the be&s;t method of &s;ecuring what we have. Yet this is certain, that the writer who never deviates, who never hazards a new thought, or a new expre&s;&s;ion, though his friends may compliment him upon his &s;agacity, though critici&s;m li&s;ts her feeble voice in his prai&s;e, will &s;eldom arrive at any degree of perfection. The way to acquire la&s;ting e&s;teem, is not by the fewne&s;s of a writer's faults, but the greatne&s;s of his beauties, and our noble&s;t works are generally mo&s;t replete with both.</P>

pardon his mi&s;taking ten times for once &s;ucceed|ing. True Genius walks along a line, and, perhaps, our greate&s;t plea&s;ure is in &s;eeing it &s;o often near falling, without being ever actually down.</P>
<P>Every &s;cience has its hitherto undi&s;covered my|&s;teries, after which men &s;hould travel undi&s;cou|raged by the failure of former adventurers. Every new attempt &s;erves, perhaps, to facilitate its fu|ture invention. We may not find the Philo&s;o|pher's &s;tone, but we &s;hall probably hit upon new inventions in pur&s;uing it. We &s;hall, per|haps, never be able to di&s;cover the longitude, yet, pehaps, we may arrive at new truths in the inve&s;tigation.</P>
<P>Were any of the&s;e &s;agacious minds among us, (and &s;urely no nation, or no period, could ever compare with us in this particular) were any of tho&s;e minds, I &s;ay, who now &s;it down contented with exploring the intricacies of another's &s;y&s;tem, bravely to &s;hake off admiration, and undazzled with the &s;plendour of another's reputation, to chalk out a path to fame for them&s;elves, and boldly culti|vate untried experiment, what might not be the re&s;ult of their enquiries, &s;hould the &s;ame &s;tudy that has made them wi&s;e, make them en|terprizing al&s;o?

<P>Projectors in a &s;tate are generally rewarded above their de&s;erts; projectors in the republic of letters, never.

<HEAD>Upon POLITICAL FRUGALITY.</HEAD>
<P>_FRUGALITY has ever been e&s;teemed a virtue as well among Pagans as Chri&s;tians: There have been even heroes who have prac|ti&s;ed it. However, we mu&s;t ac|knowledge, that it is too mode&s;t a virtue, or, if you will, too ob&s;cure a one to be e&s;&s;ential to he|roi&s;m, few heroes have been able to attain to &s;uch an height. Frugality agrees much better with po|liticks; it &s;eems to be the ba&s;e, the &s;upport, and, in a word, &s;eems to be the in&s;eparable companion of a ju&s;t admini&s;tration.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="129">However this be, there is not, perhaps, in the world a people le&s;s fond of this virtue than the Engli&s;h, and of con&s;equence there is not a nation more re&s;tle&s;s, more expo&s;ed to the unea&s;ine&s;&s;es of life, or le&s;s capable of providing for particular happine&s;s. We are taught to de&s;pi&s;e this virtue from our childhood, our education is improperly directed, and a man who has gone through the polite&s;t in&s;titutions, is generally the per&s;on who is lea&s;t acquainted with the whole&s;ome precepts of frugality. We every day hear the elegance of ta&s;te, the magnificence of &s;ome, and the gene|ro&s;ity of others, made the &s;ubject of our admira|tion and applau&s;e. All this we &s;ee repre&s;ented not as the end and recompen&s;e of labour and de|&s;ert, but as the actual re&s;ult of genius, as the mark of a noble and exalted mind.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e prai&s;es be&s;towed on luxury, for which elegance and ta&s;te are but another name, perhaps it may be thought improper to plead the cau&s;e of frugality. It may be thought low, or vainly declamatory, to exhort our youth from the follies of dre&s;s, and of every other &s;uperfluity to accu&s;tom them&s;elves, even with mechanic mean|ne&s;s, to the &s;imple nece&s;&s;aries of life. Such &s;ort of in&s;tructions may appear antiquated; yet, how|ever, they &s;eem the foundations of all our vir|tues, and the mo&s;t efficacious method of making mankind u&s;eful members of &s;ociety. Unhappily,
<PB N="131" REF="130">
however, &s;uch di&s;cour&s;es are not fa&s;hionable among us, and the fa&s;hion &s;eems every day growing &s;till more ob&s;olete, &s;ince the pre&s;s, and every other method of exhortation, &s;eems di&s;po&s;ed to talk of the luxuries of life as harmle&s;s enjoyments. I re|member, when a boy, to have remarked, that tho&s;e who in &s;chool wore the fine&s;t cloaths, were pointed at as being conceited and proud. At pre|&s;ent, our little ma&s;ters are taught to con&s;ider dre&s;s betimes, and they are regarded, even at &s;chool, with contempt, who do not appear as genteel as the re&s;t. Education &s;hould teach us to become u&s;eful, &s;ober, di&s;intere&s;ted and laborious members of &s;ociety; but does it not at pre&s;ent point out a different path! It teaches us to multiply our wants, by which means we become more eager to po&s;&s;e&s;s, in order to di&s;&s;ipate, a greater charge to our&s;elves, and more u&s;ele&s;s or obnoxious to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>If a youth happens to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more genius than fortune, he is early informed that he ought to think of his advancement in the world; that he &s;hould labour to make him&s;elf plea&s;ing to his &s;uperiors; that he &s;hould &s;hun low company; (by which is meant the company of his equals) that he &s;hould rather live a little above than below his fortune; that he &s;hould think of becoming great; but he finds none to admoni&s;h him to be|come frugal, to per&s;evere in one &s;ingle de&s;ign, to
<PB N="132" REF="131">
avoid every plea&s;ure and all flattery, which, how|ever, &s;eeming to conciliate the favour of his &s;u|periors, never conciliate their e&s;teem. There are none to teach him that the be&s;t way of be|coming happy in him&s;elf, and u&s;eful to others, is to continue in the &s;tate which fortune at fir&s;t placed him, without making too ha&s;ty &s;trides to advancement; that greatne&s;s may be attained, but &s;hould not be expected; and that they who mo&s;t impatiently expect advancement, are &s;eldom po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their wi&s;hes. He has few, I &s;ay, to teach him this le&s;&s;on, or to moderate his youthful pa&s;&s;ions, yet, this experience may &s;ay, that a young man, who but for &s;ix years of the early part of his life, could &s;eem dive&s;ted of all his pa&s;&s;ions, would certainly make, or con&s;iderably increa&s;e his fortune, and might indulge &s;everal of his favourite inclinations in manhood with the utmo&s;t &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>The efficaciou&s;ne&s;s of the&s;e means are &s;uffi|ciently known and acknowledged; but as we are apt to connect a low idea with all our notions of frugality, the per&s;on who would per&s;uade us to it, might be accu&s;ed of preaching up avarice.</P>
<P>Of all vices, however, again&s;t which morality di&s;&s;uades, there is not one more undetermined than this of avarice. Mi&s;ers are de&s;cribed by &s;ome, as men dive&s;ted of honour, &s;entiment or huma|nity;
<PB N="133" REF="132">
but this is only an ideal picture, or the re&s;emblance at lea&s;t is found but in a few. In truth, they who are generally called mi&s;ers, are &s;ome of the very be&s;t members of &s;ociety. The &s;ober, the laborious, the attentive, the frugal, are thus &s;tiled by the gay, giddy, thoughtle&s;s and extravagant. The fir&s;t &s;et of men do &s;ociety all the good, and the latter all the evil that is felt. Even the exce&s;&s;es of the fir&s;t no way injure the commonwealth; tho&s;e of the latter are the mo&s;t injurious that can be conceived.</P>
<P>The ancient Romans, more rational than we in this particular, were very far from thus mi&s;|placing their admiration or prai&s;e; in&s;tead of re|garding the practice of par&s;imony as low or vi|cious, they made it &s;ynonimous even with pro|bity. They e&s;teemed tho&s;e virtues &s;o in&s;eparable, that the known expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>Vir Frugi</HI> &s;ignified, at one and the &s;ame time, a &s;ober and managing man, an hone&s;t man, and a man of &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>The &s;criptures, in a thou&s;and places, prai&s;e oeco|nomy; and it is every where di&s;tingui&s;hed from avarice. But in &s;pite of all its &s;acred dictates, a ta&s;te for vain plea&s;ures and fooli&s;h expence is the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of the pre&s;ent times. Pa&s;&s;ion did I call it, rather the madne&s;s which at once po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es the great and the little, the rich and the poor; even &s;ome are &s;o intent upon acquiring the

<P>To attempt the entire abolition of luxury, as it would be impo&s;&s;ible, &s;o it is not my intent. The generality of mankind are too weak, too much &s;laves, to cu&s;tom and opinion, to re&s;i&s;t the torrent of bad example. But if it be impo&s;&s;ible to convert the multitude; tho&s;e who have received a more extended education, who are enlightened and judicious, may find &s;ome hints on this &s;ubject u&s;eful. They may &s;ee &s;ome abu&s;es, the &s;uppre&s;|&s;ion of which would by no means endanger public liberty; they may be directed to the abolition of &s;ome unnece&s;&s;ary expences, which have no ten|dency to promote happine&s;s or virtue, and which might be directed to better purpo&s;es. Our fire|works, our public fea&s;ts and entertainments, our entries of amba&s;&s;adors, &amp;c. what mummery all this; what childi&s;h pageants, what millions are &s;acrificed in paying tribute to cu&s;tom, what an un|nece&s;&s;ary charge at times when we are pre&s;&s;ed with real want, which cannot be &s;atisfied without burthening the poor?</P>
<P>Were &s;uch &s;uppre&s;&s;ed entirely, not a &s;ingle crea|ture in the &s;tate would have the lea&s;t cau&s;e to mourn their &s;uppre&s;&s;ion, and many might be ea&s;ed of a load they now feel lying heavily upon them. If this were put in practice, it would agree with the
<PB N="135" REF="134">
advice of a &s;en&s;ible writer of Sweden, who, in the Gazette de France, 1753, thus expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf on that &s;ubject. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It were &s;incerely to be wi&s;hed, &s;ays he, that the cu&s;tom were e&s;tabli&s;hed among&s;t us, that in all events which cau&s;e a publick joy, we made our exultations con&s;picuous only by acts u&s;eful to &s;ociety. We &s;hould then quickly &s;ee many u&s;eful monuments of our rea&s;on, which would much better perpetuate the me|mory of things worthy of being tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity, and would be much more glorious to humanity than all the&s;e tumultuous prepara|tions of fea&s;ts, entertainments, and other re|joicings u&s;ed upon &s;uch occa&s;ions."</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ame propo&s;al was long before confirmed by a Chine&s;e emperor, who lived in the la&s;t cen|tury, who, upon an occa&s;ion of extraordinary joy, forbad his &s;ubjects to make the u&s;ual illluminations, either with a de&s;ign of &s;paring their &s;ub&s;tance, or of turning them to &s;ome more durable indication of joy, more glorious for him, and more ad|vantageous to his people.</P>
<P>After &s;uch in&s;tances of political frugality, can we then continue to blame the Dutch amba&s;&s;ador at a certain court, who receiving, at his depar|ture, the portrait of the king, enriched with diamonds, a&s;ked what this fine thing might be worth? Being told that it might amount to about
<PB N="136" REF="135">
two thou&s;and pounds. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And why, cries he, can|not his maje&s;ty keep the picture, and give me the money?"</Q> This &s;implicity may be ridiculed at fir&s;t; but, when we come to examine it more clo&s;ely, men of &s;en&s;e will at once confe&s;s that he had rea&s;on in what he &s;aid, and that a pur&s;e of two thou&s;and guineas is much more &s;erviceable than a picture.</P>
<P>Should we follow the &s;ame method of &s;tate fru|gality in other re&s;pects, what numberle&s;s &s;avings might not be the re&s;ult! How many po&s;&s;ibilities of &s;aving in the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, which now burdens the &s;ubject, and enriches &s;ome mem|bers of &s;ociety, who are u&s;eful only from its cor|ruption!</P>
<P>It were to be wi&s;hed, that they who govern kingdoms, would imitate artizans. When at London a new &s;tuff has been invented, it is im|mediately counterfeited in France. How happy were it for &s;ociety, if a fir&s;t mini&s;ter would be equally &s;olicitous to tran&s;plant the u&s;eful laws of other countries into his own. We are arrived at a perfect imitation of Porcelaine; let us endeavour to imitate the good to &s;ociety that our neighbours are found to practi&s;e, and let our neighbours al&s;o imitate tho&s;e parts of duty in which we excel.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome men, who, in their garden, attempt to rai&s;e tho&s;e fruits which nature has
<PB N="137" REF="136">
adapted only to the &s;ultry climates beneath the line. We have at our very doors a thou&s;and laws and cu&s;toms infinitely u&s;eful; the&s;e are the fruits we &s;hould endeavour to tran&s;plant; the&s;e the exotics that would &s;peedily become naturalized to the &s;oil. They might grow in every climate, and benefit every po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>The be&s;t and the mo&s;t u&s;eful laws I have ever &s;een, are generally practi&s;ed in Holland. When two men are determined to go to law with each other, they are fir&s;t obliged to go before the re|conciling judges, called the <HI>peace makers.</HI> If the parties come attended with an advocate or a &s;oli|citor, they are obliged to retire, as we take fuel from the fire we are de&s;irous of extingui&s;hing.</P>
<P>The peace makers then begin advi&s;ing the parties, by a&s;&s;uring them, that it is the height of folly to wa&s;te their &s;ub&s;tance, and make them|&s;elves mutually mi&s;erable, by having recour&s;e to the tribunals of ju&s;tice: Follow but our direction, and we will accommodate matters without any expence to either. If the rage of debate is too &s;trong upon either party, they are remitted back for another day, in order that time may &s;often their tempers, and produce a reconciliation. They are thus &s;ent for twice or thrice; if their folly happens to be incurable, they are permitted to go to law, and as we give up to amputation, &s;uch
<PB N="138" REF="137">
members as cannot be cured by art, ju&s;tice is permitted to take its cour&s;e.</P>
<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary to make here long declama|tions, or calculate what &s;ociety would &s;ave, were this law adopted. I am &s;en&s;ible, that the man who advi&s;es any reformation, only &s;erves to make him&s;elf ridiculous. What! mankind will be apt to &s;ay, adopt the cu&s;toms of countries that have not &s;o much real liberty as our own, our pre&s;ent cu&s;toms what are they to any man; we are very happy under them! This mu&s;t be a very plea&s;ant fellow, who attempts to make us happier than we already are! Does he not know that abu&s;es are the patrimony of a great part of the nation. Why deprive us of a malady by which &s;uch numbers find their account. This I mu&s;t own is an argu|ment to which I have nothing to reply.</P>
<P>What numberle&s;s &s;avings might there not be made in both arts and commerce, particularly in the liberty of exerci&s;ing trade, without the nece&s;|&s;ary prerequi&s;ites of freedom! Such u&s;ele&s;s ob&s;truc|tions have crept into every &s;tate, from a &s;pirit of monopoly, a narrow &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit of gain, with|out the lea&s;t attention to general &s;ociety. Such a clog upon indu&s;try frequently drives the poor from labour, and reduces them, by degrees, to a &s;tate of hopele&s;s indigence. We have already a more than &s;ufficient repugnance to labour; we &s;hould
<PB N="139" REF="138">
by no means encrea&s;e the ob&s;tacles, or make ex|cu&s;es in a &s;tate for idlene&s;s. Such faults have ever crept into a &s;tate, under wrong or needy ad|mini&s;trations.</P>
<P>Exclu&s;ive of the ma&s;ters, there are numberle&s;s faulty expences among the workmen; clubs, gar|ni&s;hes, freedoms, and &s;uch like impo&s;itions, which are not too minute even for law to take notice of, and which &s;hould be aboli&s;hed without mercy, &s;ince they are ever the inlets to exce&s;s and idle|ne&s;s, and are the parent of all tho&s;e outrages which naturally fall upon the more u&s;eful part of &s;ociety. In the towns and countries I have &s;een, I never &s;aw a city or a village yet, who&s;e mi&s;eries were not in proportion to the number of its pub|lic hou&s;es. In Rotterdam, you may go through eight or ten &s;treets without finding a public hou&s;e. In Antwerp, almo&s;t every &s;econd hou&s;e &s;eems an alehou&s;e. In the one city, all wears the appear|ance of happine&s;s and warm affluence; in the other, the young fellows walk about the &s;treets in &s;habby finery, their fathers &s;it at the door derning or knitting &s;tockings, while their ports are filled with dunghills.</P>
<P>Alehou&s;es are ever an occa&s;ion of debauchery and exce&s;s, and either in a religious or political light, it would be our highe&s;t intere&s;t to have the greate&s;t part of them &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. They &s;hould be put un|der
<PB N="140" REF="139">
laws of not continuing open beyond a certain hour, and harbouring only proper per&s;ons. The&s;e rules, it may be &s;aid, will dimini&s;h the nece&s;&s;ary taxes; but this is fal&s;e rea&s;oning, &s;ince what was con&s;umed in debauchery abroad, would, if &s;uch a regulation took place, be more ju&s;tly, and per|haps, more equitably for the workman's family, &s;pent at home; and this cheaper to them, and without lo&s;s of time. On the other hand, our alehou&s;es being ever open, interrupt bu&s;ine&s;s; the workman is rever certain who frequents them, nor can the ma&s;ter be &s;ure of having what was begun, fini&s;hed at the convenient time.</P>
<P>An habit of frugality among the lower orders of mankind is much more beneficial to &s;ociety than the unreflecting might imagine. The pawn|broker, the attorney, and other pe&s;ts of &s;ociety, might, by proper management, be turned into &s;erviceable members; and, were their trades aboli&s;hed, it is po&s;&s;ible the &s;ame avarice that con|ducts the one, or the &s;ame chicanery that charac|terizes the other, might, by proper regulations, be converted into frugality, and commendable prudence.</P>
<P>But &s;ome have made the eulogium of luxury, have repre&s;ented it as the natural con&s;equence of every country that is become rich. Did we not employ our extraordinary wealth in &s;uperfluities,
<PB N="141" REF="140">
&s;ay they, what other means would there be to em|ploy it in? To which it may be an&s;wered, If frugality were e&s;tabli&s;hed in the &s;tate, if our expences were laid out rather in the nece&s;&s;aries than the &s;uperfluities of life, there might be fewer wants, and even fewer plea&s;ures, but infinitely more happine&s;s. The rich and the great would be better able to &s;atisfy their creditors; they would be better able to marry their children, and, in|&s;tead of one marriage at pre&s;ent, there might be two, if &s;uch regulations took place.</P>
<P>The imaginary calls of vanity, which in reality contribute nothing to our real felicity, would not then be attended to, while the real calls of na|ture might he always and univer&s;ally &s;upplied. The difference of employment in the &s;ubject is what, in reality, produces the good of &s;ociety. If the &s;ubject be engaged in providing only the luxuries, the nece&s;&s;aries mu&s;t be deficient in pro|portion. If neglecting the produce of our own country, our minds are &s;et upon the productions of another, we encrea&s;e our wants, but not our means; and every new imported delicacy for our tables, or ornament in our equipage, is a tax upon the poor.</P>
<P>The true intere&s;t of every government is to cultivate the nece&s;&s;aries, by which is always meant every happine&s;s our own country can produce; and &s;uppre&s;s all the luxuries, by which is meant,
<PB N="142" REF="141">
on the other hand, every happine&s;s imported from abroad. Commerce has therefore its bounds; and every new import, in&s;tead of encouragement, &s;hould be fir&s;t examined whether it be conducive to the intere&s;t of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Among the many publications with which the pre&s;s is every day burthened, I have often won|dered why we never had, as in other countries, an Oeconomical Journal, which might at once direct to all the u&s;eful di&s;coveries in other coun|tries, and &s;pread tho&s;e of our own. As other journals &s;erve to amu&s;e the learned, or what is more often the ca&s;e, to make them quarrel, while they only &s;erve to give us the hi&s;tory of the mi&s;chievous world, for &s;o I call our warriors; or the idle world, for &s;o may the learned be called; they never trouble their heads about the mo&s;t u&s;e|ful part of mankind, our pea&s;ants and our arti|zans; were &s;uch a work carried into execution with proper management and ju&s;t direction, it might &s;erve as a repo&s;itory for every u&s;eful improve|ment, and increa&s;e that knowledge which learning often &s;erves to confound.</P>
<P>Sweden &s;eems the only country where the &s;ci|ence of oeconomy &s;eems to have fixed its empire. In other countries, it is cultivated only by a few admirers, or by &s;ocieties which have not received
<PB N="143" REF="142">
&s;ufficient &s;anction to become compleatly u&s;eful; but here there is founded a royal academy, de&s;tined to this purpo&s;e only, compo&s;ed of the mo&s;t learned and powerful members of the &s;tate; an academy which declines every thing which only terminates in amu&s;ement, erudition or curio&s;ity, and admits only of ob&s;ervations tending to illu&s;trate hu&s;bandry, agriculture, and every real phy&s;ical improvement. In this country nothing is left to private rapacity, but every improvement is immediately diffu&s;ed, and its inventor immediately recompen&s;ed by the &s;tate. Happy were it &s;o in other countries; by this means every impo&s;tor would be prevented from ruining or deceiving the publick with pre|tended di&s;coveries or no&s;trums, and every real in|ventor would not, by this means, &s;uffer the in|conveniences of &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, true oeconomy, equally unknown to the prodigal and avaricious, &s;eems to be a ju&s;t mean between both extremes; and to a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of this, at pre&s;ent decried virtue, it is that we are to at|tribute a great part of the evils which infe&s;t &s;ociety. A ta&s;te for &s;uperfluity, amu&s;ement, and plea&s;ure bring effeminacy, idlene&s;s, and expence in their train. But a thir&s;t of riches is always proportioned to our debauchery, and the greate&s;t prodigal is too frequently found to be the greate&s;t mi&s;er; &s;o that the vices which &s;eem the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite, are fre|quently

found to produce each other; and, to avoid both, it is only nece&s;&s;ary to be frugal.</P>

<P>SCARCE a day pa&s;&s;es in which we do not hear compliments paid to Dryden, Pope, and other writers of the la&s;t age, while not a month comes forward that is not loaded with in|vective again&s;t the writers of this. Strange, that our critics &s;hould be fond of giving their favours to tho&s;e who are in&s;en&s;ible of the obligation, and their di&s;like to the&s;e who, of all mankind, are mo&s;t apt to retaliate the injury.</P>
<P>Even though our pre&s;ent writers had not equal merit with their predece&s;&s;ors, it would be politic to u&s;e them with ceremony. Every compliment paid them would be more agreeable, in proportion as they lea&s;t de&s;erved it. Tell a lady with an hand|&s;ome face that &s;he is pretty, &s;he only thinks it her due; it is what the has heard a thou&s;and times be|fore from others, and di&s;regards the compliment: but a&s;&s;ure a lady, the cut of who&s;e vi&s;age is &s;ome|thing more plain, that &s;he looks killing to-day, &s;he in&s;tantly bridles up and feels the force of the well-timed flattery the whole day after. Compliments which we think are de&s;erved, we only accept, as debts, with indifference; but tho&s;e which con&s;cience
<PB N="146" REF="145">
informs us we do not merit, we receive with the &s;ame gratitude that we do favours given away.</P>
<P>Our gentlemen, however, who pre&s;ide at the di&s;tribution of literary fame, &s;eem re&s;olved to part with prai&s;e neither from motives of ju&s;tice, or ge|nero&s;ity; one would think, when they take pen in hand, that it was only to blot reputations, and to put their &s;eals to the pacquet which con&s;igns every new-born effort to oblivion.</P>
<P>Yet, notwith&s;tanding the republic of letters hangs at pre&s;ent to feebly together; though tho&s;e friend&s;hips which once promoted literary fame &s;eem now to be di&s;continued; though every writer who now draws the quill &s;eems to aim at profit, as well as applau&s;e, many among them are pro|bably laying in &s;tores for immortality, and are pro|vided with a &s;ufficient &s;tock of reputation to la&s;t the whole journey.</P>
<P>As I was indulging the&s;e reflections, in order to eke out the pre&s;ent page, I could not avoid pur|&s;uing the metaphor, of going a journey, in my ima|gination, and formed the following Re&s;verie too wild for allegory, and too regular for a dream.</P>
<P>I fancied my&s;elf placed in the yard of a large inn, in which there were an infinite number of waggons and &s;tage coaches, attended by fellows
<PB N="147" REF="146">
who either invited the company to take their places, or were bu&s;ied in packing their baggage. Each vehicle had its in&s;cription, &s;hewing the place of its de&s;tination. On one I could read, <HI>The plea&s;ure &s;tage-coach</HI>; on another, <HI>The waggon of indu&s;try</HI>; on a third, <HI>The vanity whim</HI>; and on a fourth, <HI>The landau of riches.</HI> I had &s;ome inclination to &s;tep into each of the&s;e, one after ano|ther; but I know not by what means I pa&s;&s;ed them by, and at la&s;t fixed my eye upon a &s;mall carriage, Berlin fa&s;hion, which &s;eemed the mo&s;t convenient vehicle at a di&s;tance in the world; and, upon my nearer approach, found it to be <HI>The fame machine.</HI></P>
<P>I in&s;tantly made up to the coachman, whom I found to be an affable and &s;eemingly good-natured fellow. He informed me, that he had but a few days ago returned from the temple of fame, to which he had been carrying Addi&s;on, Swift, Pope, Steele, Congreve, and Colley Cibber. That they made but indifferent company by the way, and that he once or twice was going to empty his berlin of the whole cargo: however, &s;ays he, I got them all &s;afe home, with no other damage than a black eye, which Colley gave Mr. Pope, and am now returned for another coachful. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If that be all, friend, &s;aid I, and if you are in want of company, I'll make one with all my heart. Open the door; I hope the machine rides ea&s;y."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Oh! for that, &s;ir, extremely
<PB N="148" REF="147">
ea&s;y."</Q> But &s;till keeping the door &s;hut, and mea&s;uring me with his eye, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Pray, &s;ir, have you no luggage? You &s;eem to be a good-natured &s;ort of a gentleman; but I don't find you have got any luggage, and I never permit any to travel with me but &s;uch as have &s;omething valuable to pay for coach-hire."</Q> Examining my pockets, I own I was not a little di&s;concerted at this unexpected rebuff; but con&s;idering that I car|ried a number of the BEE under my arm, I was re&s;olved to open it in his eyes, and dazzle him with the &s;plendor of the page. He read the title and contents, however, without any emotion, and a&s;&s;ured me he had never heard of it before. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In &s;hort, friend, &s;aid he, now lo&s;ing all his former re&s;pect, you mu&s;t not come in. I ex|pect better pa&s;&s;engers; but, as you &s;eem an harmle&s;s creature, perhaps, if there be room left, I may let you ride a while for charity."</Q></P>
<P>I now took my &s;tand by the coachman at the door, and &s;ince I could not command a &s;eat, was re&s;olved to be as u&s;eful as po&s;&s;ible, and earn by my a&s;&s;iduity, what I could not by my merit.</P>
<P>The next that pre&s;ented for a place, was a mo&s;t whim&s;ical figure indeed. He was hung round with papers of his own compo&s;ing, not un|like tho&s;e who &s;ing ballads in the &s;treets, and came dancing up to the door with all the confidence of
<PB N="149" REF="148">
in&s;tant admittance. The volubility of his motion and addre&s;s prevented my being able to read more of his cargo than the word In&s;pector, which was written in great letters at the top of &s;ome of the papers. He opened the coach-door him&s;elf with|out any ceremony, and was ju&s;t &s;lipping in, when the coachman, with as little ceremony, pulled him back. Our figure &s;eemed perfectly an|gry at this repul&s;e, and demanded gentleman's &s;atisfaction. <Q REND="inline">"Lord, &s;ir! replied the coachman, in&s;tead of proper luggage, by your bulk you &s;eem loaded for a We&s;t-India voyage. You are big enough, with all your papers, to crack twenty &s;tage-coaches. Excu&s;e me, indeed, &s;ir, for you mu&s;t not enter."</Q> Our figure now be|gan to expo&s;tulate; he a&s;&s;ured the coachman, that though his baggage &s;eemed to bulky, it was perfectly light, and that he would be contented with the &s;malle&s;t corner of room. But Jehu was inflexible, and the carrier of the in&s;pectors was &s;ent to dance back again, with all his papers flut|tering in the wind. We expected to have no more trouble from this quarter, when, in a few minutes, the &s;ame figure changed his appearance, like harlequin upon the &s;tage, and with the &s;ame confidence again made his approaches, dre&s;&s;ed in lace, and carrying nothing but a no&s;egay. Upon coming near, he thru&s;t the no&s;egay to the coach|man's note, gra&s;ped the bra&s;s, and &s;eemed now re&s;olved to enter by violence. I found the
<PB N="150" REF="149">
&s;truggle &s;oon begin to grow hot, and the coach|man, who was a little old, unable to continue the conte&s;t, &s;o, in order to ingratiate my&s;elf, I &s;tept in to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and our united efforts &s;ent our literary Proteus, though wor&s;ted, uncon|quered &s;till, clear off, dancing a rigadoon, and &s;melling to his own no&s;egay.</P>
<P>The per&s;on who after him appeared as candi|date for a place in the &s;tage, came up with an air not quire &s;o confident, but &s;omewhat how|ever theatrical; and, in&s;tead of entering, made the coachman a very low bow, which the other returned, and de&s;ired to &s;ee his baggage; upon which he in&s;tantly produced &s;ome farces, a tra|gedy, and other mi&s;cellany productions. The coachman, ca&s;ting his eye upon the cargoe, a&s;|&s;ured him, at pre&s;ent he could not po&s;&s;ibly have a place, but hoped in time he might a&s;pire to one, as he &s;eemed to have read in the book of nature, without a careful peru&s;al of which none ever found entrance at the temple of fame. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What, (replied the di&s;appointed poet) &s;hall my tragedy, in which I have vindicated the cau&s;e of liberty and virtue!"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Follow nature, (returned the other) and never expect to find la&s;ting fame by topics which only plea&s;e from their popularity.

<P>This was a very grave per&s;onage, whom at &s;ome di&s;tance I took for one of the mo&s;t re&s;erved, and even di&s;agreeable figures I had &s;een; but as he approached, his appearance improved, and when I could di&s;tingui&s;h him thoroughly, I per|ceived, that, in &s;pite of the &s;everity of his brow, he had one of the mo&s;t good-natured countenances that could be imagined. Upon coming to open the &s;tage door, he lifted a parcel of folios into the &s;eat before him, but our inqui&s;itorial coach|man at once &s;hoved them out again. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What, not take in my dictionary! exclaimed the other in a rage."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Be patient, &s;ir, (replyed the coachman) I have drove a coach, man and boy, the&s;e two thou&s;and years; but I do not remember to have carried above one dictionary during the whole time. That little book which I perceive peeping from one of your pockets, may I pre&s;ume to a&s;k what it con|tains?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A mere trifle, (replied the author) it is called the Rambler."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Rambler!

Spectator; though others have ob&s;erved, that the reflections, by being refined, &s;ometimes become minute."</Q></P>
<P>This grave gentleman was &s;carce &s;eated, when another, who&s;e appearance was &s;omething more modern, &s;eemed willing to enter, yet afraid to a&s;k. He carried in his hand a bundle of e&s;&s;ays, of which the coachman was curious enough to enquire the contents. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The&s;e (replied the gentleman) are rhap&s;odies again&s;t the religion of my country."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And how can you expect to come into my coach, after thus chu&s;ing the wrong &s;ide of the que&s;tion."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ay, but I am right (replied the other;) and if you give me leave, I &s;hall in a few minutes &s;tate the argument."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Right or wrong (&s;aid the coachman) he who di&s;turbs religion, is a blockhead, and he &s;hall never travel in a coach of mine."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If then (&s;aid the gentleman, mu&s;tering up all his courage) if I am not to have admittance as an e&s;&s;ayi&s;t, I hope I &s;hall not be repul&s;ed as an hi&s;torian; the la&s;t volume of my hi&s;tory met with applau&s;e."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Yes, (replied the coachman) but I have heard only the fir&s;t approved at the temple of fame; and as I &s;ee you have it about you, enter without further ceremony."</Q> My attention was now diverted to a crowd, who were pu&s;hing forward a per&s;on that &s;eemed more inclined to the
<PB N="153" REF="152" MS="y">
<HI>&s;tage coach of riches</HI>; but by their means he was driven forward to the &s;ame machine, which he, however, &s;eemed heartily to de&s;pi&s;e. Impelled, however, by their &s;ollicitations, he &s;teps up, flouri&s;hing a voluminous hi&s;tory, and demand|ing admittance. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sir, I have formerly heard your name mentioned (&s;ays the coachman) but never as an hi&s;torian. Is there no other work upon which you may claim a place?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"None, replied the other, except a romance; but this is a work of too trifling a nature to claim future attention."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You mi&s;take (&s;ays the inqui&s;itor) a well-written romance is no &s;uch ea&s;y ta&s;k as is generally imagined. I remem|ber formerly to have carried Cervantes and Se|grais, and if you think fit, you may enter."</Q> Upon our three literary travellers coming into the &s;ame coach, I li&s;tened attentively to hear what might be the conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed upon this extraordinary occa&s;ion; when, in&s;tead of agreeable or entertaining dialogue, I found them grumbling at each other, and each &s;eemed di&s;contented with his companions. Strange! thought I to my&s;elf, that they who are thus born to enlighten the world, &s;hould &s;till pre&s;erve the narrow preju|dices of childhood, and, by di&s;agreeing, make even the highe&s;t merit ridiculous. Were the learned and the wi&s;e to unite again&s;t the dunces of &s;ociety, in&s;tead of &s;ometimes &s;iding into oppo&s;ite parties with them, they might throw a lu&s;tre

upon each other's reputation, and teach every rank of &s;ubordinate merit, if not to admire, at lea&s;t not to avow di&s;like.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e reflections, I perceived the coachman, unmindful of me, had now mounted the box. Several were approaching to be taken in, who&s;e preten&s;ions I was &s;en&s;ible were very ju&s;t, I therefore de&s;ired him to &s;top, and take in more pa&s;&s;engers; but he replied, as he had now mounted the box, it would be improper to come down; but that he &s;hould take them all, one af|ter the other, when he &s;hould return. So he drove away, and, for my&s;elf, as I could not get in, I mounted behind, in order to hear the con|ver&s;ation on the way.</P>

<HEAD>A Word or two on the late FARCE, CALLED HIGH LIFE BELOW STAIRS.</HEAD>
<P>JUST as I had expected, before I &s;aw this farce, I found it, formed on too narrow a plan to afford a plea&s;ing variety. The &s;amene&s;s of the humour in every &s;cene could not at la&s;t fail of being di&s;agreeable. The poor, affecting the manners of the rich, might be carried on thro'
<PB N="155" REF="154">
one character or two at the mo&s;t, with great propriety; but to have almo&s;t every per&s;onage on the &s;cene almo&s;t of the &s;ame character, and re|flecting the follies of each other, was unartful in the poet to the la&s;t degree.</P>
<P>The &s;cene was al&s;o almo&s;t a continuation of the &s;ame ab&s;urdity; and my Lord Duke and Sir Harry (two footmen who a&s;&s;ume the&s;e characters) have nothing el&s;e to <HI>do</HI> but to talk like their ma&s;ters, and are only introduced to &s;peak, and to &s;hew them&s;elves. Thus, as there is a &s;ame|ne&s;s of character, there is a barrenne&s;s of inci|dent, which, by a very &s;mall &s;hare of addre&s;s, the poet might have ea&s;ily avoided.</P>
<P>From a conformity to critic rules, which, per|haps, on the whole, have done more harm than good, our author has &s;acrificed all the vivacity of the dialogue to nature; and though he makes his characters talk like &s;ervants, they are &s;eldom ab&s;urd enough, or lively enough, to make us merry. Though he is always natural, he happens &s;eldom to be humorous.</P>
<P>The &s;atire was well intended, if we regard it as being ma&s;ters our&s;elves; but, probably, a phi|lo&s;opher would rejoice in that liberty which Engli&s;hmen give their dome&s;tics; and, for my own part, I cannot avoid being plea&s;ed at the
<PB N="156" REF="155">
happine&s;s of tho&s;e poor creatures, who, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, contribute to mine. The Athenians, the polite&s;t and be&s;t-natured people upon earth, were the kinde&s;t to their &s;laves; and if a per&s;on may judge, who has &s;een the world, our Engli&s;h &s;ervants are the be&s;t treated, becau&s;e the generality of our Engli&s;h gentlemen, are the polite&s;t under the &s;un.</P>
<P>But not to lift my feeble voice among the pack of critics, who, probably, have no other occupa|tion but that of cutting up every thing new. I mu&s;t own, there are one or two &s;cenes that are fine &s;atire, and &s;ufficiently humorous; particu|larly the fir&s;t interview between the two footmen, which, at once, ridicules the manners of the great, and the ab&s;urdity of their imitators.</P>
<P>Whatever defects there might be in the com|po&s;ition, there were none in the action; in this the performers &s;hewed more humour than I had fancied them capable of. Mr. Palmer and Mr. King were entirely what they de&s;ired to repre|&s;ent; and Mrs. Give (but what need I talk of her, &s;ince, without the lea&s;t exaggeration, &s;he has more true humour than any actor or actre&s;s upon the Engli&s;h or any other &s;tage I have &s;een;) &s;he, I &s;ay, did the part all the ju&s;tice it was capable of. And, upon the whole, a farce, which has only this to recommend it, that the author took his plan from the volume of nature, by the &s;prightly manner in which it was performed, was, for one night, a tolerable entertainment. Thus much
<PB N="157" REF="156">
may be &s;aid in its vindication, that people of fa&s;hion &s;eemed more plea&s;ed in the repre&s;entation than the &s;ubordinate ranks of people.</P>

<P>EVERY age &s;eems to have its favourite pur|&s;uits, which &s;erve to amu&s;e the idle, and re|lieve the attention of the indu&s;trious. Happy the man who is born excellent in the pur&s;uit in vogue, and who&s;e genius &s;eems adapted to the times he lives in. How many do we &s;ee, who might have excelled in arts or &s;ciences, and who &s;eem fur|ni&s;hed with talents equal to the greate&s;t di&s;coveries, had the road not been already beaten by their predece&s;&s;ors, and nothing left for them, except trifles to di&s;cover, while others, of very moderate abilities, become famous, becau&s;e happening to be fir&s;t in the reigning pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>Thus, at the renewal of letters in Europe, the ta&s;te was not to compo&s;e new books, but to com|ment on the old ones. It was not to be expected that new books &s;hould be written, when there were &s;o many of the Ancients, either not known, or not under&s;tood. It was not rea&s;onable to at|tempt new conque&s;ts, while they had &s;uch an exten&s;ive region lying wa&s;te for want of cultiva|tion. At that period, critici&s;m and erudition were the reigning &s;tudies of the times; and he, who had only an inventive genius, might have
<PB N="158" REF="157">
langui&s;hed in hopele&s;s ob&s;curity. When the writers of antiquity were &s;ufficiently explained and known, the learned &s;et about imitating them: From hence proceeded the number of latin ora|tors, poets and hi&s;torians, in the reigns of Clement the &s;eventh, and Alexander the &s;ixth. This pa&s;|&s;ion for antiquity la&s;ted for many years, to the utter exclu&s;ion of every other pur&s;uit, till &s;ome began to find, that tho&s;e works which were imi|tated from nature, were more like the writings of antiquity, than even tho&s;e written in expre&s;s imi|tation. It was then modern language began to be cultivated with a&s;&s;iduity, and our poets and orators poured forth their wonders upon the world.</P>
<P>As writers become more numerous, it is natural for readers to become more indolent; from whence mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e a de&s;ire of attaining know|ledge with the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible ea&s;e. No &s;cience or art offers its in&s;truction and amu&s;ement in &s;o ob|vious a manner as &s;tatuary and painting. From hence we &s;ee, that a de&s;ire of cultivating tho&s;e arts generally attends the decline of &s;cience. Thus the fine&s;t &s;tatues, and the mo&s;t beautiful paintings of antiquity preceded but a little the ab&s;olute decay of every other &s;cience. The &s;tatues of Antoninus, Comodus, and their cotemporaries, are the fine&s;t productions of the chi&s;&s;el, and appeared but ju&s;t before learning was de&s;troyed by comment, criti|ci&s;m, and barbarous inva&s;ions.</P>
<P>What happened in Rome may probably be the ca&s;e with us at home. Our nobility are now more
<PB N="159" REF="158">
&s;olicitous in patronizing painters and &s;culptors than tho&s;e of any other polite profe&s;&s;ion; and from the lord, who has his gallery, down to the 'prentice, who has his twopenny copper-plate, all are admirers of this art. The great, by their care&s;&s;es, &s;eem in|&s;en&s;ible to all other merit but that of the pencil; and the vulgar buy every book rather from the ex|cellence of the &s;culptor than the writer.</P>
<P>How happy were it now, if men of real excel|lence in that profe&s;&s;ion were to ari&s;e! Were the painters of Italy now to appear, who once wan|dered like beggars from one city to another, and produce their almo&s;t breathing figures, what re|wards might they not expect! But many of them lived without rewards, and therefore rewards alone will never produce their equals. We have often found the great exert them&s;elves not only without promotion, but in &s;pite of oppo&s;ition. We have found them flouri&s;hing, like medicinal plants, in a region of &s;avagene&s;s and barbarity, their excellence unknown, and their virtues unheeded.</P>
<P>They who have &s;een the paintings of Cara|vagio are &s;en&s;ible of the &s;urpri&s;ing impre&s;&s;ion they make; bold, &s;welling, terrible to the la&s;t degree; all &s;eem animated, and &s;peaks him among the foremo&s;t of his profe&s;&s;ion; yet this man's fortune and his fame &s;eemed ever in oppo&s;ition to each other.</P>
<P>Unknowing how to flatter the great, he was driven from city to city in the utmo&s;t indigence, and might truly be &s;aid to paint for his bread.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="159">Having one day in&s;ulted a per&s;on of di&s;tinction, who refu&s;ed to pay him all the re&s;pect which he thought his due, he was obliged to leave Rome, and travel on foot, his u&s;ual method of going his journeys down into the country, without either money or friends to &s;ub&s;i&s;t him.</P>
<P>After he had travelled in this manner as long as his &s;trength would permit, faint with famine and fatigue, he at la&s;t called at an ob&s;cure inn by the way &s;ide.

<HEAD>On EDUCATION. To the AUTHOR of the BEE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_AS few &s;ubjects are more intere&s;ting to &s;ociety, &s;o few have been more frequently written upon, than the education of youth. Yet is it not a little &s;urprizing, that it &s;hould have been treated almo&s;t by all in a declamatory manner? They have in&s;i&s;ted largely on the ad|vantages that re&s;ult from it, both to the in|dividual and to &s;ociety, and have expatiated in
<PB N="162" REF="161">
the prai&s;e of what none have ever been &s;o hardy as to call in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of giving us fine, but empty harangues, upon this &s;ubject, in&s;tead of indulging each his particular and whim&s;ical &s;y&s;tems, it had been much better if the writers on this &s;ubject had treated it in a more &s;cientific manner, repre&s;&s;ed all the &s;allies of imagination, and given us the re&s;ult of their ob&s;ervations with didactic &s;implicity. Upon this &s;ubject, the &s;malle&s;t errors are of the mo&s;t dangerous con&s;equence; and the author &s;hould venture the imputation of &s;tupidity upon a topic, where his &s;lighte&s;t deviations may tend to injure the ri&s;ing generation.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, therefore, throw out a few thoughts upon this &s;ubject, which have not been attended to by others, and &s;hall di&s;mi&s;s all attempts to plea&s;e, while I &s;tudy only in&s;truction.</P>
<P>The manner in which our youth of London are at pre&s;ent educated is, &s;ome in free &s;chools in the city, but the far greater number in boarding &s;chools about town. The parent ju&s;tly con&s;ults the health of his child, and finds an education in the country tends to promote this, much more than a continuance in town. Thus far they are right; if there were a po&s;&s;ibility of having even our free &s;chools kept a little out of town, it
<PB N="163" REF="162">
would certainly conduce to the health and vigour of, perhaps, the mind, as well as the body. It may be thought whim&s;ical, but it is truth; I have found by experience, that they, who have &s;pent all their lives in cities, contract not only an effeminacy of habit, but even of thinking.</P>
<P>But when I have &s;aid, that the boarding &s;chools are preferable to free &s;chools, as being in the country, this is certainly the only advantage I can allow them, otherwi&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible to con|ceive the ignorance of tho&s;e who take upon them the important tru&s;t of education. Is any man unfit for any of the profe&s;&s;ions; he finds his la&s;t re&s;ource in &s;etting up &s;chool. Do any become bankrupts in trade. They &s;till &s;et up a boarding &s;chool, and drive a trade this way, when all others fail: Nay, I have been told of butchers and barbers, who have turned &s;choolma&s;ters; and more &s;urpri&s;ing &s;till, made fortunes in their new profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Could we think our&s;elves in a country of civi|lized people; could it be conceived that we have any regard for po&s;terity, when &s;uch are permitted to take the charge of the morals, genius and health of tho&s;e dear little pledges, who may one day be the guardians of the liberties of Europe, and who may &s;erve as the honour and bulwark of their aged parents? The care of our children, is it
<PB N="164" REF="163">
below the &s;tate? is it fit to indulge the caprice of the ignorant with the di&s;po&s;al of their children in this particular? For the &s;tate to take the charge of all its children, as in Per&s;ia or Sparta, might at pre&s;ent be inconvenient; but &s;urely, with great ea&s;e, it might ca&s;t an eye to their in&s;tructors. Of all members of &s;ociety, I do not know a more u&s;eful, or a more honourable one, than a &s;chool-ma&s;ter; at the &s;ame time that I do not &s;ee any more generally de&s;pi&s;ed, or who&s;e talents are &s;o ill rewarded.</P>
<P>Were the &s;alaries of &s;chool ma&s;ters to be aug|mented from a diminution of u&s;ele&s;s &s;ine cures, how might it turn to the advantage of this people; a people whom, without flattery, I may, in other re&s;pects, term the wi&s;e&s;t and greate&s;t upon earth. But while I would reward the de|&s;erving, I would di&s;mi&s;s tho&s;e utterly unqualified for their employment: In &s;hort, I would make the bu&s;ine&s;s of a &s;chool ma&s;ter every way more re&s;pectable, by encrea&s;ing their &s;alaries, and ad|mitting only men of proper abilities.</P>
<P>There are already &s;chool ma&s;ters appointed, and they have &s;ome &s;mall &s;alaries; but where at pre&s;ent there is but one &s;chool ma&s;ter appointed, there &s;hould at lea&s;t be two; and wherever the &s;alary is at pre&s;ent twenty pounds, it &s;hould be an hundred. Do we give immoderate benefices
<PB N="165" REF="164">
to tho&s;e who in&s;truct our&s;elves, and &s;hall we deny even &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to tho&s;e who in&s;truct our children. Every member of &s;ociety &s;hould be paid in propor|tion as he is nece&s;&s;ary; and I will be bold enough to &s;ay, that &s;chool ma&s;ters in a &s;tate, are more nece&s;&s;ary than clergymen, as children &s;tand in more need of in&s;truction than their parents.</P>
<P>But in&s;tead of this, as I have already ob&s;erved, we &s;end them to board in the country to the mo&s;t ignorant &s;et of men that can be imagined. But lea&s;t the ignorance of the ma&s;ter be not &s;ufficient, the child is generally con&s;igned to the u&s;her. This is generally &s;ome poor needy animal, little &s;upe|rior to a footman either in learning or &s;pirit, in|vited to his place by an adverti&s;ement, and kept there merely from his being of a complying di&s;po|&s;ition, and making the children fond of him. <HI>You give your child to be educated to a &s;lave,</HI> &s;ays a philo&s;opher to a rich man; <HI>In&s;tead of one &s;lave, you will then have two.</HI></P>
<P>It were well, however, if parents, upon fixing their children in one of the&s;e hou&s;es, would exa|mine the abilities of the u&s;her as well as the ma&s;ter; for, whatever they are told to the con|trary, the u&s;her is generally the per&s;on mo&s;t em|ployed in their education. If then, a gentleman, upon putting out his &s;on to one of the&s;e hou&s;es, &s;ees the u&s;her di&s;regarded by the ma&s;ter, he may
<PB N="166" REF="165">
depend upon it, that he is equally di&s;regarded by the boys; the truth is, in &s;pite of all their en|deavours to plea&s;e, they are generally the laughing &s;tock of the &s;chool. Every trick is played upon the u&s;her; the oddity of his manners, his dre&s;s, or his language, are a fund of eternal ridicule; the ma&s;ter him&s;elf now and then cannot avoid joining in the laugh, and the poor wretch, eter|nally re&s;enting this ill u&s;age, &s;eems to live in a &s;tate of war with all the family. This is a very proper per&s;on, is it not, to give children a reli&s;h for learning? They mu&s;t e&s;teem learning very much, when they &s;ee its profe&s;&s;ors u&s;ed with &s;uch ceremony. If the u&s;her be de&s;pi&s;ed, the father may be a&s;&s;ured his child will never be properly in&s;tructed.</P>
<P>But let me &s;uppo&s;e, that there are &s;ome &s;chools without the&s;e inconveniencies, where the ma&s;ter and u&s;hers are men of learning, reputation and a&s;&s;iduity. If there are to be found &s;uch, they cannot be prized in a &s;tate &s;ufficiently. A boy will learn more true wi&s;dom in a public &s;chool in a year, than by a private education in five. It is not from ma&s;ters, but from their equals, youth learn a knowledge of the world; the little tricks they play each other, the puni&s;hment that fre|quently attends the commi&s;&s;ion, is a ju&s;t picture of the great world, and all the ways of men are practi&s;ed in a public &s;chool in miniature. It is
<PB N="167" REF="166">
true, a child is early made acquainted with &s;ome vices in a &s;chool, but it is better to know the&s;e when a boy, than be fir&s;t taught them when a man, for their novelty then may have irre&s;i&s;tible charms.</P>
<P>In a public education, boys early learn tem|perance; and if the parents and friends would give them le&s;s money upon their u&s;ual vi&s;its, it would be much to their advantage, &s;ince it may ju&s;tly be &s;aid, that a great part of their di&s;orders ari&s;e from &s;urfeit, <HI>Plus occidit gula quam gladius.</HI> And now I am come to the article of health, it may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve&punc; that Mr. Locke, and &s;ome others, have advi&s;ed that children &s;hould be inured to cold, to fatigue, and hard&s;hip, from their youth; but Mr. Locke was but an indifferent phy&s;ician. Habit, I grant, has great influence over our con&s;titutions, but we have not preci&s;e ideas upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>We know, that among &s;avages, and even among our pea&s;ants, there are found children born with &s;uch con&s;titutions, that they cro&s;s ri|vers by &s;wimming, endure cold, thir&s;t, hunger, and want of &s;leep, to a &s;urprizing degree; that when they happen to fall &s;ick, they are cured without the help of medicine, by nature alone. Such examples are adduced to per&s;uade us to imi|tate their manner of education, and accu&s;tom
<PB N="168" REF="167">
our&s;elves betimes to &s;upport the &s;ame fatigues. But had the&s;e gentlemen con&s;idered fir&s;t, that tho&s;e &s;avages and pea&s;ants are generally not &s;o long lived as they who have led a more indolent life: Secondly, that the more laborious the life is, the le&s;s populous is the country. Had they con&s;idered, that what phy&s;icians call the <HI>&s;tamina vitae,</HI> by fatigue and labour, become rigid, and thus anticipate old age. That the number who &s;urvive tho&s;e rude trials, bears no proportion to tho&s;e who die in the experiment. Had the&s;e things been properly con&s;idered, they would not have thus extolled an education begun in fatigue and hard&s;hips. Peter the Great, willing to enure the children of his &s;eamen to a life of hard&s;hip, ordered that they &s;hould only drink &s;ea water, but they unfortunately all died under the ex|periment.</P>
<P>But while I would exclude all unnece&s;&s;ary la|bours, yet &s;till I would recommend temperance in the highe&s;t degree. No luxurious di&s;hes with high &s;ea&s;oning, nothing given children to force an appetite, as little &s;ugared or &s;alted provi&s;ions as po&s;&s;ible, though never &s;o plea&s;ing; but milk, morning and night, &s;hould be their con&s;tant food. This diet would make them more healthy than any of tho&s;e &s;lops that are u&s;ually cooked by the mi&s;tre&s;s of a boarding &s;chool; be&s;ides, it corrects
<PB N="169" REF="168">
any con&s;umptive habits, not unfrequently found among&s;t the children of city parents.</P>
<P>As boys &s;hould be educated with temperance, &s;o the fir&s;t greate&s;t le&s;&s;on that &s;hould be taught them is, to admire frugality. It is by the exer|ci&s;e of this virtue alone, they can ever expect to be u&s;eful members of &s;ociety. It is true, lectures continually repeated upon this &s;ubject, may make &s;ome boys when they grow up, run into an ex|treme, and become mi&s;ers; but it were well, had we more mi&s;ers than we have among us. I know few characters more u&s;eful in &s;ociety, for a man's having a larger or &s;maller &s;hare of money lying u&s;ele&s;s by him, no way injures the common|wealth; &s;ince, &s;hould every mi&s;er now exhau&s;t his &s;tores, this might make gold more plenty, but it would not encrea&s;e the commodities or plea&s;ures of life; they would &s;till remain as they are at pre&s;ent; it matters not, therefore, whether men are mi&s;ers or not, if they be only frugal, labo|rious, and fill the &s;tation they have cho&s;en. If they deny them&s;elves the nece&s;&s;aries of life, &s;o|ciety is no way injured by their folly.</P>
<P>In&s;tead, therefore, of romances, which prai&s;e young men of &s;pirit, who go through a variety of adventures, and at la&s;t conclude a life of di&s;&s;ipa|tion, folly, and extravagance in riches and matri|mony, there &s;hould be &s;ome men of wit employed
<PB N="170" REF="169">
to compo&s;e books that might equally intere&s;t the pa&s;&s;ions of our youth, where &s;uch an one might be prai&s;ed for having re&s;i&s;ted allurements when young, and how he at la&s;t became lord mayor; how he was married to a lady of great &s;en&s;e, for|tune, and beauty; to be as explicit as po&s;&s;ible, the old &s;tory of Whittington, were his cat left out, might be more &s;erviceable to the tender mind, than either Tom Jones, Jo&s;eph Andrews, or an hundred others, where frugality is the only good quality the hero is not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. Were our &s;chool-ma&s;ters, if any of them have &s;en&s;e enough to daw up &s;uch a work, thus employed it would be much more &s;erviceable to their pupils than all the grammars and dictionaries they may publi&s;h the&s;e ten years.</P>
<P>Children &s;hould early be in&s;tructed in the arts from which they would afterwards draw the greate&s;t advantages. When the wonders of na|ture are never expo&s;ed to our view, we have no great de&s;ire to become acquainted with tho&s;e parts of learning which pretend to account for the phae|nomena. One of the ancients complains, that as &s;oon as young men have left &s;chool, and are obliged to conver&s;e in the world, they fancy them&s;elves tran&s;ported into a new region. <HI>Ut cum in forum venerarint exi&s;timent &s;e in alium ter|rum orbem delatos.</HI> We &s;hould early, therefore, in&s;truct them in the experiments, if I may &s;o ex|pre&s;s
<PB N="171" REF="170">
it, of knowledge, and leave to maturer age the accounting for the cau&s;es. But, in&s;tead of that, when boys begin natural philo&s;ophy in col|leges, they have not the lea&s;t curio&s;ity for tho&s;e parts of the &s;cience which are propo&s;ed for their in&s;truction; they have never before &s;een the phae|nomena, and con&s;equently have no curio&s;ity to learn the rea&s;ons. Might natural philo&s;ophy, therefore, be made their pa&s;time in &s;chool, by this means it would in college become their amu&s;e|ment.</P>
<P>In &s;everal of the machines now in u&s;e, there would be ample field both for in&s;truction and amu&s;ement; the different &s;orts of the pho&s;pho|rus, the artificial pyrites, magneti&s;m, electricity, the experiments upon the rarefaction and weight of the air, and tho&s;e upon ela&s;tic bodies, might employ their idle hours, and none &s;hould be called from play to &s;ee &s;uch experiments but &s;uch as thought proper. At fir&s;t then it would be &s;uffi|cient if the in&s;truments, and the effects of their combination, were only &s;hewn; the cau&s;es &s;hould be deferred to a maturer age, or to tho&s;e times when natural curio&s;ity prompts us to di&s;cover the wonders of nature. Man is placed in this world as a &s;pectator; when he is tired with wondering at all the novelties about him, and not till then, does he de&s;ire to be made acquainted with the cau&s;es that create tho&s;e wonders.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="171">What I have ob&s;erved with regard to natural philo&s;ophy, I would extend to every other &s;cience what&s;oever. We &s;hould teach them as many of the facts as were po&s;&s;ible, and defer the cau&s;es until they &s;eemed of them&s;elves de&s;irous of know|ing them. A mind thus leaving &s;chool, &s;tored with all the &s;imple experiences of &s;cience, would be the fitte&s;t in the world for the college cour&s;e; and though &s;uch a youth might not appear &s;o bright, or &s;o talkative, as tho&s;e who had learned the real principles and cau&s;es of &s;ome of the &s;ciences, yet he would make a wi&s;er man, and would re|tain a more la&s;ting pa&s;&s;ion for letters than he who was early burdened with the di&s;agreeable in&s;titu|tion of effect and cau&s;e.</P>
<P>In hi&s;tory, &s;uch &s;tories alone &s;hould be laid be|fore them as might catch the imagination; in&s;tead of this, they are too frequently obliged to toil through the four empires, as they are called, where their memories are burdened by a number of di&s;gu&s;ting names, that de&s;troy all their future reli&s;h for our be&s;t hi&s;torians, who may be termed the true&s;t teachers of wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Every &s;pecies of flattery &s;hould be carefully avoided; a boy who happens to &s;ay a &s;prightly thing is generally applauded &s;o much, that he happens to continue a coxcomb &s;ometimes all his life after. He is reputed a wit at fourteen, and
<PB N="173" REF="172">
becomes a blockhead at twenty. Nur&s;es, footmen, and &s;uch, &s;hould therefore be driven away as much as po&s;&s;ible. I was even going to add, that the mother her&s;elf &s;hould &s;tifle her plea&s;ure, or her vanity, when little ma&s;ter happens to &s;ay a good or a &s;mart thing. Tho&s;e mode&s;t lubberly boys, who &s;eem to want &s;pirit, generally go through their bu&s;ine&s;s with more ea&s;e to them&s;elves, and more &s;atisfaction to their in&s;tructors.</P>
<P>There has of late a gentleman appeared, who thinks the &s;tudy of rhetoric e&s;&s;ential to a per|fect education. That bold male eloquence, which often, without plea&s;ing, convinces, is generally de&s;troyed by &s;uch in&s;titutions. Convincing elo|quence, however, is infinitely more &s;erviceable to its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or than the mo&s;t florid harangue or the mo&s;t pathetic tones that can be imagined; and the man who is thoroughly convinced him&s;elf who under&s;tands his &s;ubject, and the language he &s;peaks in, will be more apt to &s;ilence oppo&s;ition, than he who &s;tudies the force of his periods, and fills our ears with &s;ounds, while our minds are de&s;titute of conviction.</P>
<P>It was reckoned the fault of the orators at the decline of the Roman empire, when they had been long in&s;tructed by rhetoricians, that their periods were &s;o harmonious, as that they could be &s;ung as well as &s;poken. What a ridiculous figure
<PB N="174" REF="173">
mu&s;t one of the&s;e gentlemen cut, thus mea&s;uring &s;yllables, and weighing words, when he &s;hould plead the cau&s;e of his client! Two architects were once candidates for the building a certain temple at Athens; the fir&s;t harangued the crowd very learnedly upon the different orders of archi|tecture, and &s;hewed them in what manner the temple &s;hould be built; the other, who got up to &s;peak after him, only ob&s;erved, that what his brother had &s;poken he could do; and thus he at once gained his cau&s;e.</P>
<P>To teach men to be orators, is little le&s;s than to teach them to be poets; and for my part, I &s;hould have too great a regard for my child, to wi&s;h him a manor only in a book&s;eller's &s;hop.</P>
<P>Another pa&s;&s;ion which the pre&s;ent age is apt to run into, is to make children learn all things; the languages, the &s;ciences, mu&s;ic, the exerci&s;es, and painting. Thus the child &s;oon becomes a <HI>talker</HI> in all, but a <HI>ma&s;ter</HI> in none. He thus ac|quires a &s;uperficial fondne&s;s for every thing, and only &s;hews his ignorance when he attempts to ex|hibit his &s;kill.</P>
<P>As I deliver my thoughts without method or con|nection, &s;o the reader mu&s;t not be &s;urprized to find me once more addre&s;&s;ing &s;choolma&s;ters on the pre&s;ent
<PB N="175" REF="174">
method of teaching the learned languages, which is commonly by literal tran&s;lations. I would a&s;k &s;uch, if they were to travel a journey, whether tho&s;e parts of the road in which they found the greate&s;t difficulties would no be mo&s;t &s;trongly re|membered? Boys, who, if I may continue the allu&s;ion, gallop through one of the ancients with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a tran&s;lation, can have but a very &s;light acquaintance either with the author or his language. It is by the exerci&s;e of the mind alone that a language is learned; but a literal tran&s;lation, on the oppo&s;ite page, leaves no exer|ci&s;e for the memory at all. The boy will not be at the fatigue of remembering, when his doubts are at once &s;atisfied by a glance of the eye; where|as were every word to be &s;ought from a dictionary, the learner would attempt to remember them, to &s;ave him the trouble of looking out for it for the future.</P>
<P>To continue in the &s;ame pedantic &s;train, tho' no &s;choolma&s;ter, of all the various grammars now taught in the &s;chools about town, I would recommend only the old common one; I have for|got whether Lily's, or an emendation of him. The others may be improvements; but &s;uch im|provements &s;eem, to me, only mere grammatical niceties, no way influencing the learner, but per|haps loading him with trifling &s;ubtilties, which,
<PB N="176" REF="175">
at a proper age, he mu&s;t be at &s;ome pains to forget.</P>
<P>Whatever pains a ma&s;ter may take to make the learning of the langages agreeable to his pupil, he may depend upon it, it will be at fir&s;t extreamly unplea&s;ant. The rudiments of every language, therefore, mu&s;t be given as a ta&s;k, not as an amu&s;ement. Attempting to deceive children into in&s;truction of this kind, is only deceiving our|&s;elves; and I know no pa&s;&s;ion capable of conquer|ing a child's natural lazine&s;s but fear. Solomon has &s;aid it before me; nor is there any more cer|tain, tho' perhaps more di&s;agreeable truth, than the proverb in ver&s;e, too well known to repeat on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. It is very probable that parents are told of &s;ome ma&s;ters who never u&s;e the rod, and con&s;equeetly are thought the pro|pere&s;t in&s;tructors for their children; but though tenderne&s;s is a requi&s;ite quality in an in&s;tructor, yet there is too often the true&s;t tenderne&s;s in well-timed correction.</P>
<P>Some have ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, that all pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould be bani&s;hed on this terrible occa&s;ion; but I know not, there is a frailty attending human na|ture, that few ma&s;ters are able to keep their temper whil&s;t they correct. I knew a good-natured man, who was &s;en&s;ible of his own weak|ne&s;s in this re&s;pect, and con&s;equently had recour&s;e
<PB N="177" REF="176">
to the following expedient to prevent his pa&s;&s;ions from being engaged, yet at the &s;ame time admini&s;ter ju&s;tice with impartiality. When ever any of his pupils committed a fault, he &s;ummoned a jury of his peers, I mean of the boys of his own or the next cla&s;&s;es to him; his accu&s;ers &s;tood forth; he had a liberty of pleading in his own defence, and one or two more had a liberty of pleading again&s;t him: when found guilty by the pannel, he was con&s;igned to the footman, who attended in the hou&s;e, who had previous orders to u&s;e his puni&s;hment with lenity. By this means the ma|&s;ter took off the odium of puni&s;hment from him|&s;elf; and the footman, between whom and the boys there could not be even the &s;lighte&s;t inti|macy, was placed in &s;uch a light as to be &s;hunned by every boy in &s;chool.</P>
<P>And now I have gone thus far, perhaps you will think me &s;ome pedagogue, willing, by a well-timed puff, to encrea&s;e the reputation of his own &s;chool; but &s;uch is not the ca&s;e. The re|gard I have for &s;ociety, for tho&s;e tender minds who are the objects of the pre&s;ent e&s;&s;ay, &s;uch are the only motives I have for offering tho&s;e thoughts, calculated not to &s;urprize by their novelty, or the elegance of compo&s;ition, but merely to remedy &s;ome defects which have crept into the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of &s;chool education. If this letter &s;hould be in&s;erted, perhaps I may trouble you, in my next, with &s;ome thoughts upon an univer&s;ity edu|cation, not with an intent to exhau&s;t the &s;ubject, but to amend &s;ome few abu&s;es.

<HEAD>SOME ACCOUNT OF THE ACADEMIES of ITALY.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is not, perhaps, a country in Eu|rope, in which learning is &s;o fa&s;t upon the decline as in Italy; yet not one in which there are &s;uch a number of academies in&s;tituted for its &s;upport. There is &s;carce a con&s;iderable town in the whole country, which has not one or two in&s;titutions of this nature, where the learned, as they are plea&s;ed to call them&s;elves, meet to harangue, to compliment each other, and prai&s;e the utility of their in&s;titution.</P>
<P>Jarchius has taken the trouble to give us a li&s;t of tho&s;e clubs, or academies, which amount to five hundred and fifty, each di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;omewhat whim&s;ical in the name. The acade|micians of Bologna, for in&s;tance, are divided into the Abbandonati, the Au&s;io&s;i, Ocio&s;io, Arcadi Confu&s;i, Dubbio&s;i, &amp;c.

the Cicalata Academica (or, as we might expre&s;s it, the tickling &s;ociety) of Florence. I have ju&s;t now before me a manu&s;cript oration, &s;poken by the late Toma&s;o Crudeli, at that &s;ociety, which will, at once, &s;erve to give a better picture of the manner in which men of wit amu&s;e them&s;elves in that country, than any thing I could &s;ay upon the occa&s;ion. The oration is this:</P>
<P>"The younger the nymph, my dear companions, the more happy the lover. From fourteen to &s;eventeen, you are &s;ure of finding love for love; from &s;eventeen to twenty one, there is always a mixture of intere&s;t and affection. But when that period is pa&s;t, no longer expect to receive, but to buy. No longer expect a nymph who gives, but who &s;ells her favours. At this age, every glance is taught its duty; not a look, not a &s;igh, with|out de&s;ign; the lady, like a &s;kilful warrior, aims at the heart of another, while &s;he &s;hields her own from danger.</P>
<P>On the contrary, at fifteen, you may expect nothing but &s;implicity, innocence and nature. The pa&s;&s;ions are then &s;incere; the &s;oul &s;eems &s;eated in the lips; the dear object feels pre&s;ent happi|ne&s;s, without being anxious for the future; her eyes brighten if her lover approaches; her &s;miles are borrowed from the graces, and her very mi|&s;takes &s;eem to complete her de&s;ires.</P>
<P>Lucretia was ju&s;t &s;ixteen. The ro&s;e and lilly took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her face, and her bo&s;om, by its hue and its coldne&s;s, &s;eemed covered with

&s;now. So much beauty, and &s;o much virtue, &s;eldom want admirers. Orlandino, a youth of &s;en&s;e and merit, was among the number. He had long langui&s;hed for an opportunity of declaring his pa&s;&s;ion, when Cupid, as if willing to indulge his happine&s;s, brought the charming young couple by mere accident to an arbour, where every pry|ing eye, but that of love, was ab&s;ent. Orlan|dino talked of the &s;incerity of his pa&s;&s;ion, and mixed flattery with his addre&s;&s;es; but it was all in vain. The nymph was pre-engaged, and had long devoted to heaven tho&s;e charms for which he &s;ued. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My dear Orlandino, &s;aid &s;he, you know I have long been dedicated to St. Cathe|rine, and to her belongs all that lies below my girdle; all that is above, you may freely po&s;|&s;e&s;s, but farther I cannot, mu&s;t not, comply. The vow is pa&s;&s;ed; I wi&s;h it were undone, but now it is impo&s;&s;ible."</Q> You may con|ceive, my companions, the embarra&s;&s;ment our young lovers felt upon this occa&s;ion.

St. Ca|therine was touched with compa&s;&s;ion; for lo, a miracle! Lucretia's girdle unloo&s;ed, as if with|out hands; and though before bound round her middle, fell &s;pontaneou&s;ly down to her feet, and gave Orlandino the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all tho&s;e beauties which lay above it,"</P>

<HEAD>Of ELOQUENCE.</HEAD>
<P>_OF all kinds of &s;ucce&s;s, that of an orator is the mo&s;t plea&s;ing. Upon other occa&s;ions, the applau&s;e we de&s;erve is conferred in our ab&s;ence, and we are in&s;en&s;ible of the plea|&s;ure we have given; but in eloquence, the vic|tory and the triumph are in&s;eparable. We read our own glory in the face of every &s;pectator, the audience is moved, the antagoni&s;t is defeated, and the whole circle bur&s;ts into un&s;olicited applau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="193">The rewards which attend excellence in this way are &s;o plea&s;ing, that numbers have written profe&s;&s;ed treati&s;es to teach us the art; &s;chools have been e&s;tabli&s;hed with no other intent; rhe|toric has taken place among the in&s;titutions, and pedants have ranged under proper heads, and di&s;tingui&s;hed with long learned names, <HI>&s;ome</HI> of the &s;trokes of nature, or of pa&s;&s;ion, which ora|tors have u&s;ed. I &s;ay only <HI>&s;ome</HI> for a folio volume could not contain all the figures which have been u&s;ed by the truly eloquent, and &s;carce a good &s;peaker or writer, but makes u&s;e of &s;ome that are peculiar or new.</P>
<P>Eloquence has preceded the rules of rhetoric, as languages have been formed before grammar. Nature renders men eloquent in great intere&s;ts, or great pa&s;&s;ions. He that is &s;en&s;ibly touched, &s;ees things with a very different eye from the re&s;t of mankind. All nature to him becomes an object of compari&s;on and metaphor, without attending to it; he throws life into all, and in&s;pires his audience with a part of his own enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>It has been remarked, that the lower parts of mankind generally expre&s;s them&s;elves mo&s;t figura|tively, and that tropes are found in the mo&s;t ordinary forms of conver&s;ation. Thus, in every language, the heart burns; the courage is rouzed;
<PB N="195" REF="194">
the eyes &s;parkle; the &s;pirits are ca&s;t down; pa&s;|&s;ion enflames; pride &s;wells, and pity &s;inks the &s;oul. Nature, every where, &s;peaks in tho&s;e &s;trong images, which, from their frequency, pa&s;s unnoticed.</P>
<P>Nature it is which in&s;pires tho&s;e rapturous en|thu&s;ia&s;ms, tho&s;e irre&s;i&s;tible turns; a &s;trong pa&s;|&s;ion, a pre&s;&s;ing danger, calls up all the imagina|tion, and gives the orator irre&s;i&s;tible force. Thus, a captain of the fir&s;t caliphs, &s;eeing his &s;oldiers fly, cried out, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Whither do you run? the enemy are not there! You have been told that the caliph is dead; but God is &s;till living. He regards the brave, and will reward the coura|geous. Advance!"</Q></P>
<P><HI>A man, therefore, may be called eloquent, who transfers the pa&s;&s;ion or &s;entiment with which he is moved him&s;elf, into the brea&s;t of another</HI>; and this definition appears the more ju&s;t, as it compre|hends the graces of &s;ilence, and of action. An intimate per&s;ua&s;ion of the truth to be proved, is the &s;entiment and pa&s;&s;ion to be transferred; and he who effects this, is truly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the talent of eloquence.</P>
<P>I have called eloquence a talent, and not an art, as &s;o many rhetoricians have done, as art is acquired by exerci&s;e and &s;tudy, and eloquence is
<PB N="196" REF="195">
the gift of nature. Rutes will never make either a work or a di&s;cour&s;e eloquent; they only &s;erve to prevent faults, but not to introduce beauties; to prevent tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages which are truly eloquent, and dictated by nature from being blended with others, which might di&s;gu&s;t, or, at lea&s;t, abate our pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>What we clearly conceive, (&s;ays Boileau) we can clearly expre&s;s. I may add, that what is felt with emotion, is expre&s;&s;ed al&s;o with the &s;ame movements; the words ari&s;e as readily to paint our emotions, as to expre&s;s our thoughts with per&s;picuity. The cool care an orator takes to expre&s;s pa&s;&s;ions which he does not feel, only prevents his ri&s;ing into that pa&s;&s;ion he would &s;eem to feel. In a word, to feel your &s;ubject tho|roughly, and to &s;peak without fear, are the only rules of eloquence, properly &s;o called, which I can offer. Examine a writer of genius on the mo&s;t beautiful parts of his work, and he will al|ways a&s;&s;ure you that &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages are generally tho&s;e which have given him the lea&s;t trouble, for they came as if by in&s;piration. To pretend that cold and didactic precepts will make a man elo|quent, is only to prove that he is incapable of eloquence.</P>
<P>But, as in being per&s;picuous, it is nece&s;&s;ary to have a full idea of the &s;ubject, &s;o in being elo|quent,
<PB N="197" REF="196">
it is not &s;ufficient, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, to feel by halves. The orator &s;hould be &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed, which is generally the effects of a fine and exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility, and not that tran&s;ient and &s;uperficial emotion, which he ex|cites in the greate&s;t part of his audience. It is even impo&s;&s;ible to affect the hearers in any great degree, without being affected our&s;elves. In vain it will be objected, that many writers have had the art to in&s;pire their readers with a pa&s;&s;ion for virtue, without being virtuous them&s;elves; &s;ince it may be an&s;wered, that &s;entiments of virtue filled their minds at the time they were writing. They felt the in&s;piration &s;trongly, while they prai&s;ed ju&s;tice, genero&s;ity, or good nature; but, unhappily for them, the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions might have been di&s;continued, when they laid down the pen. In vain will it be objected again, that we can move without being moved, as we can convince, without being convinced. It is much ea&s;ier to deceive our rea&s;on than our&s;elves; a trifling defect in rea&s;oning, may be over&s;een, and lead a man a&s;tray; for it requires rea&s;on and time to detect the fal&s;hood, but our pa&s;&s;ions are not &s;o ea&s;ily impo&s;ed upon, our eyes, our ears, and every &s;en&s;e, is watchful to detect the impo&s;ture.</P>
<P>No di&s;cour&s;e can be eloquent, that does not elevate the mind. Pathetic eloquence, it is true, has for its only object to affect; but I appeal to
<PB N="198" REF="197">
men of &s;en&s;ibility, whether their pathetic feelings are not accompanied with &s;ome degree of eleva|tion. We may then call eloquence and &s;ublimity the &s;ame thing, &s;ince it is impo&s;&s;ible to be one, without feeling the other. From hence it follows, that we may be eloquent in any language, &s;ince no language refu&s;es to paint tho&s;e &s;entiments with which we are thoroughly impre&s;&s;ed. What is u&s;ually called &s;ublimity of &s;tile, &s;eems to be only an error. Eloquence is not in the words, but in the &s;ubject, and in great concerns, the more &s;imply any thing is expre&s;&s;ed, it is generally the more &s;ublime. True eloquence does not con&s;i&s;t, as the rhetoricians a&s;&s;ure us, in &s;aying great things in a &s;ublime &s;tyle, but in a &s;imple &s;tyle; for there is, properly &s;peaking, no &s;uch thing as a &s;ublime &s;tyle, the &s;ublimity lies only in the things; and when they are not &s;o, the language may be turgid, affected, metaphorical, but not affecting.</P>
<P>What can be more &s;imply expre&s;&s;ed, than the following extract from a celebrated preacher, and yet what was ever more &s;ublime? Speaking of the &s;mall number of the elect, he breaks out thus among his audience: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Let me &s;uppo&s;e that this was the la&s;t hour of us all; that the heavens were opening over our heads; that time was pa&s;&s;ed, and eternity begun; that Je&s;us Chri&s;t in all his glory, that man of &s;orrows in all his glory, appeared on the tribunal, and that we
<PB N="199" REF="198">
were a&s;&s;embled here to receive our final decree of life or death eternal! Let me a&s;k, im|pre&s;&s;ed with terror like you, and not &s;eparating my lot from yours, but putting my&s;elf in the &s;ame &s;ituation in which we mu&s;t all one day appear before God, our judge. Let me a&s;k, if Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hould now appear to make the terrible &s;eparation of the ju&s;t from the unju&s;t, do you think the greate&s;t number would be &s;aved? Do you think the number of the elect would even be equal to that of the &s;inners? Do you think, if all our works were examined with ju&s;tice, would he find ten ju&s;t per&s;ons in this great a&s;&s;embly? Mon&s;ters of ingratitude would he find one?"</Q> Such pa&s;&s;ages as the&s;e, are &s;ublime in every language. The expre&s;&s;ion may be le&s;s &s;triking, or more indi&s;tinct, but the greatne&s;s of the idea &s;till remains. In a word, we may be eloquent in every language and in every &s;tyle, &s;ince elocution is only an a&s;&s;i&s;tant, but not a con&s;titutor of eloquence.</P>
<P>Of what u&s;e, then, will it be &s;aid, are all the precepts given us upon this head, both by the antients and moderns? I an&s;wer, that they cannot make us eloquent, but they will certainly prevent us from becoming ridiculous. They can &s;eldom procure a &s;ingle beauty, but they may bani&s;h a thou&s;and faults. The true method of an orator, is not to attempt always to move, always to affect,
<PB N="200" REF="199">
to be continually &s;ublime, but at proper intervals to give re&s;t both to his own and the pa&s;&s;ions of his audience. In the&s;e periods of relaxation, or of preparation rather, rules may teach him to avoid any thing low, trivial, or di&s;gu&s;ting. Thus critici&s;m, properly &s;peaking, is intended not to a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e parts which are &s;ublime, but tho&s;e which are naturally mean and humble, which are compo&s;ed with coolne&s;s and caution, and where the orator rather endeavours not to offend, than attempts to plea&s;e.</P>
<P>I have hitherto in&s;i&s;ted more &s;trenuou&s;ly on that eloquence which &s;peaks to the pa&s;&s;ions, as it is a &s;pecies of oratory almo&s;t unknown in England. At the bar it is quite di&s;continued, and I think with ju&s;tice. In the &s;enate, it is u&s;ed but &s;paringly, as the orator &s;peaks to enlightened judges. But in the pulpit, in which the orator &s;hould chiefly addre&s;s the vulgar, it &s;eems &s;trange, that it &s;hould be entirely laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P>The vulgar of England are without exception, the mo&s;t barbarous and the mo&s;t unknowing of any in Europe. A great part of their ignorance may be chiefly a&s;cribed to their teachers, who, with the mo&s;t pretty gentleman-like &s;erenity, deliver their cool di&s;cour&s;es, and addre&s;s the rea&s;on of men, who have never rea&s;oned in all their lives. They are told of cau&s;e and effect, of beings &s;elf
<PB N="201" REF="200">
exi&s;tent, and the univer&s;al &s;cale of beings. They are informed of the excellence of the Bangorian controver&s;y, and the ab&s;urdity of an intermediate &s;tate. The &s;pruce preacher reads his lucubration without lifting his no&s;e from the text, and never ventures to earn the &s;hame of an enthu&s;ia&s;t.</P>
<P>By this means, though his audience feel not one word of all he &s;ays, he earns, however, among his acquaintance, the character of a man of &s;en&s;e; among his acquaintance only did I &s;ay, nay, even with his bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>The polite of every country have &s;everal mo|tives to induce them to a rectitude of action; the love of virtue for its own &s;ake, the &s;hame of of|fending, and the de&s;ire of plea&s;ing. The vulgar have but one, the enforcements of religion; and yet tho&s;e who &s;hould pu&s;h this motive home to their hearts, are ba&s;ely found to de&s;ert their po&s;t. They &s;peak to the &s;quire, the philo&s;opher, and the pedant; but the poor, tho&s;e who really want in&s;truction, are left unin&s;tructed.</P>
<P>I have attended mo&s;t of our pulpit orators, who, it mu&s;t be owned, write extremely well upon the text they a&s;&s;ume. To give them their due al&s;o, they read their &s;ermons with elegance and propriety, but this goes but a very &s;hort way in true eloquence. The &s;peaker mu&s;t be moved.
<PB N="202" REF="201">
In this, in this alone, our Engli&s;h divines are defi|cient. Were they to &s;peak to a few calm di&s;pa&s;|&s;ionate hearers, they certainly u&s;e the propere&s;t methods of addre&s;s; but their audience is chiefly compo&s;ed of the poor, who mu&s;t be influenced by motives of reward and puni&s;hment, and who&s;e only virtues lie in &s;elf-intere&s;t or fear.</P>
<P>How then are &s;uch to be addre&s;&s;ed; not by &s;tu|died periods, or cold di&s;qui&s;itions; not by the labours of the head, but the hone&s;t &s;pontaneous dictates of the heart. Neither writing a &s;ermon with regular periods and all the harmony of ele|gant expre&s;&s;ion; neither reading it with empha&s;is, propriety, and deliberation; neither plea&s;ing with metaphor, &s;imile, or rhetorical fu&s;tian; neither arguing coolly, and untying con&s;equences united in <HI>a priori,</HI> nor bundling up inductions <HI>a po&s;teriori</HI>; neither pedantic jargon, nor academical trifling, can per&s;uade the poor; writing a di&s;cour&s;e coolly in the clo&s;et, then getting it by memory, and delivering it on Sundays, even that will not do. What then is to be done? I know of no expe|dient to &s;peak; to &s;peak at once intelligibly, and feelingly, except to under&s;tand the language. To be convinced of the truth of the object; to be perfectly acquainted with the &s;ubject in view, to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s your&s;elf with a low opinion of your audience, and to do the re&s;t extempore. By this means &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions, new thoughts, ri&s;ing

<HEAD>CUSTOM and LAWS compared.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT, &s;ay &s;ome, can give us a more con|temptible idea of a large &s;tate than to find it mo&s;tly governed by cu&s;tom; to have few writ|ten laws, and no boundaries to mark the juri&s;|diction between the &s;enate and people? Among the number who &s;peak in this manner is the great Monte&s;quieu, who a&s;&s;erts that every nation is free in proportion to the number of its written laws, and &s;eems to hint at a de&s;potic and arbitrary con|duct in the pre&s;ent king of Pru&s;&s;ia, who has abridged the laws of his country into a very &s;hort compa&s;s.</P>
<P>As Tacitus and Monte&s;quieu happen to differ in &s;entiment upon a &s;ubject of &s;o much importance (for the Roman expre&s;ly a&s;&s;erts, that the &s;tate is generally vicious in proportion to the number of its laws) it will not be ami&s;s to examine it a little more minutely, and &s;ee whether a &s;tate, which, like England, is burdened with a multiplicity of written laws, or which, like Switzerland, Ge|neva, and &s;ome other republics, is governed by cu&s;tom, and the determination of the judge is be&s;t.</P>
<P>And to prove the &s;uperiority of cu&s;tom to written law, we &s;hall at lea&s;t find hi&s;tory con|&s;piring.
<PB N="208" REF="209">
Cu&s;tom, or the traditional ob&s;ervance of the practice of their forefathers, was what di|rected the Romans, as well in their public as private determinations. Cu&s;tom was appealed to in pronouncing &s;entence again&s;t a criminal, where part of the formulary was <HI>more majorum.</HI> So Salu&s;t, &s;peaking of the expul&s;ion of Tarquin, &s;ays, <HI>mutato more,</HI> and not <HI>lege mutata</HI>; and Vir|gil, <HI>paci&s;que imponere morem.</HI> So that, in tho&s;e times of the empire in which the people retained their liberty, they were governed by cu&s;tom; when they &s;unk under oppre&s;&s;ion and tyranny, they were re&s;trained by new laws, and the laws of tradition aboli&s;hed.</P>
<P>As getting the ancients on our &s;ide is half a victory, it will not be ami&s;s to fortify the argu|ment with an ob&s;ervation of Chry&s;o&s;tom's: <HI>That the en&s;laved are the fitte&s;t to be governed by laws, and free men by cu&s;tom.</HI> Cu&s;tom partakes of the nature of parental injunction; it is kept by the people them&s;elves, and ob&s;erved with a willing obedience. The ob&s;ervance of it mu&s;t, there|fore, be a mark of freedom, and coming origi|nally to a &s;tate from the reverenced founders of its liberty, will be an encouragement and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to it in the defence of that ble&s;&s;ing; but a con|quered people, a nation of &s;laves, mu&s;t pretend to none of this freedom, or the&s;e happy di&s;tinc|tions, having, by degeneracy, lo&s;t all right to

their brave forefathers free in&s;titutions, their ma&s;ters will in policy take the forfeiture; and the fixing a conque&s;t mu&s;t be done by giving laws which may every moment &s;erve to remind the people en&s;laved of their conquerors, nothing be|ing more dangerous than to tru&s;t a late-&s;ubdued people with old cu&s;toms, that pre&s;ently upbraid their degeneracy, and provoke them to revolt.</P>
<P>The wi&s;dom of the Roman republic, in their veneration for cu&s;tom, and backwardne&s;s to in|troduce a new law, was perhaps the cau&s;e of their long continuance, and of the virtues of which they have &s;et the world &s;o many ex|amples. But to &s;hew in what that wi&s;dom con|&s;i&s;ts, it may be proper to ob&s;erve, that the bene|fit of new written laws are merely confined to the con&s;equences of their ob&s;ervance; but cu&s;tomary laws, keeping up a veneration for the founders, engage men in the imitation of their virtues, as well as policy. To this may be a&s;cribed the re|ligious regard the Romans paid to their forefathers memory, and their adhering for &s;o many ages to the practice of the &s;ame virtues, which no|thing contributed more to efface than the intro|duction of a voluminous body of new laws over the neck of venerable cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>The &s;implicity, conci&s;ene&s;s, and antiquity of cu&s;tom gives an air of maje&s;ty and immutability
<PB N="210" REF="211">
that in&s;pires awe and veneration; but new laws are too apt to be voluminous, perplexed, and in|determinate; from whence mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e neglect, contempt, and ignorance.</P>
<P>As every human in&s;titution is &s;ubject to gro&s;s imperfections, &s;o laws mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be liable to the &s;ame inconveniences, and their defects &s;oon di&s;covered. Thus, through the weakne&s;s of one part, all the re&s;t are liable to be brought into con|tempt. But &s;uch weakne&s;&s;es in a cu&s;tom, for very obvious rea&s;ons, evade an examination; be|&s;ides, a friendly prejudice always &s;tands up in their favour.</P>
<P>But let us &s;uppo&s;e a new law to be perfectly equitable and nece&s;&s;ary; yet, if the procurers of it have betrayed a conduct that confe&s;&s;es bye-ends and private motives, the di&s;gu&s;t to the circum|&s;tances di&s;po&s;es us, unrea&s;onably indeed, to an irreverence of the law it&s;elf; but we are indul|gently blind to the mo&s;t vi&s;ible imperfections of an old cu&s;tom. Though we perceive the defects our&s;elves, yet we remain per&s;uaded that our wi&s;e forefathers had good rea&s;ons for what they did; and though &s;uch motives no longer continue, the benefit will &s;till go along with the ob&s;ervance, though we don't know how. It is thus the Ro|man lawyers &s;peak, <HI>Non omnium quae a majoribus con&s;tituta &s;unt ratio reddi pote&s;t, et ideo rationes

eorum quae con&s;tituuntur inquiri non oportet, alia quin multa ex his quae certa &s;unt &s;ubvertuntur.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e laws which pre&s;erve to them&s;elves the greate&s;t love and ob&s;ervance, mu&s;t needs be be&s;t; but cu&s;tom, as it executes it&s;elf, mu&s;t be nece&s;|&s;arily &s;uperior to written laws in this re&s;pect, which are to be executed by another. Thus no|thing can be more certain than that numerous written laws are a &s;ign of a degenerate commu|nity, and are frequently not the con&s;equence of vicious morals in a &s;tate, but the cau&s;es.</P>
<P>From hence we &s;ee how much greater benefit it would be to the &s;tate rather to abridge than en|crea&s;e its laws.

<HEAD>SABINUS and OLINDA.</HEAD>
<P>IN a fair, rich and flouri&s;hing country, who&s;e clifts are wa&s;hed by the German ocean, lived Sabinus, a youth formed by nature to make a conque&s;t wherever he thought proper; but the con&s;tancy of his di&s;po&s;ition fixed him only with Olinda. He was, indeed, &s;uperior to her in fortune, but that defect on her &s;ide was &s;o amply &s;upplied by her merit, that none was thought more worthy of his regards than &s;he. He loved her, he was beloved by her; and, in a &s;hort time, by joining hands publickly, they avowed the union of their hearts. But, alas! none, how|ever fortunate, however happy, are exempt from the &s;hafts of envy, and the malignant effects of ungoverned appetite. How un&s;afe, how dete&s;table, are they, who have this fury for their guide. How certainly will it lead them from them&s;elves, and plunge them in errors they would have &s;hud|dered at, even in apprehen&s;ion. Ariana, a lady of many amiable qualities, very nearly allied to Sabinus, and highly e&s;teemed by him, imagined her&s;elf &s;lighted, and injuriou&s;ly treated, &s;ince his marriage with Olinda. By uncautiou&s;ly &s;uffering this jea|lou&s;y to corrode in her brea&s;t, &s;he began to give a loo&s;e to pa&s;&s;ion; &s;he forgot tho&s;e many virtues, for which the had been &s;o long, and &s;o ju&s;tly ap|plauded.
<PB N="216" REF="217">
Cau&s;ele&s;s &s;u&s;picion, and mi&s;taken re&s;ent|ment, betrayed her, into all the gloom of di&s;con|tent; &s;he &s;ighed without cea&s;ing; the happine&s;s of others gave her intolerable pain; &s;he thought of nothing but revenge. How unlike what &s;he was, the chearful, the prudent, the compa&s;&s;ionate Ariana!</P>
<P>She continually laboured to di&s;turb an union &s;o firmly, &s;o affectionately founded, and planned every &s;cheme which &s;he thought mo&s;t likely to di&s;turb it.</P>
<P>Fortune &s;eemed willing to promote her unju&s;t intentions; the circum&s;tances of Sabinus had been long embarra&s;&s;ed by a tedious law-&s;uit, and the court determining the cau&s;e unexpectedly in fa|vour of his opponent, it &s;unk his fortune to the lowe&s;t pitch of penury from the highe&s;t affluence. From the nearne&s;s of relation&s;hip, Sabinus ex|pected from Ariana tho&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tances his pre&s;ent &s;ituation required; but &s;he was in&s;en&s;ible to all his entreaties, and the ju&s;tice of every remon|&s;trance, unle&s;s he fir&s;t &s;eparated from Olinda, whom &s;he regarded with dete&s;tation. Upon a com|pliance with her de&s;ires in this re&s;pect, &s;he promi&s;ed her fortune, her intere&s;t, and her all, &s;hould be at his command. Sabinus was &s;hocked at the propo&s;al; he loved his wife with inexpre&s;&s;ible tenderne&s;s, and refu&s;ed tho&s;e offers with indignation which
<PB N="217" REF="218">
were to be purcha&s;ed at &s;o high a price, Ariana was no le&s;s di&s;plea&s;ed to find her offers rejected, and gave a loo&s;e to all that warmth which &s;he had long endeavoured to &s;uppre&s;s. Reproach gene|rally produces recrimination; the quarrel ro&s;e to &s;uch a height, that Sabinus was marked for de|&s;truction; and the very next day, upon the &s;trength of an old family debt, he was &s;ent to gaol, with none but Olinda to comfort him in his mi&s;eries. In this man&s;ion of di&s;tre&s;s they lived together with re&s;ignation and even with comfort. She provided the frugal meal, and he read for her while employed in the little offices of do|me&s;tic concern. Their fellow pri&s;oners admired their contentment, and whenever they had a de|&s;ire of relaxing into mirth, and enjoying tho&s;e little comforts that a pri&s;on affords, Sabinus and Olinda were &s;ure to be of the party. In&s;tead of reproach|ing each other for their mutual wretchedne&s;s, they both lightened it, by bearing each a &s;hare of the load impo&s;ed by providence. Whenever Sabinus &s;hewed the lea&s;t concern on his dear partner's account, &s;he conjured him by the love he bore her, by tho&s;e tender ties which now united them for ever, not to di&s;compo&s;e him&s;elf. That, &s;o long as his affection la&s;ted, &s;he defied all the ills of fortune, and every lo&s;s of fame or friend&s;hip.

<P>A propo&s;al of &s;o ba&s;e a nature filled our un|happy couple with horror; they ordered the me&s;|&s;enger immediately out of the room, and falling upon each other's neck, indulged an agony of &s;or|row; for now even all hopes of relief were ba|ni&s;hed. The me&s;&s;enger who made the propo&s;al, however, was only a &s;py &s;ent by Ariana to &s;ound the di&s;po&s;itions of a man &s;he loved at once and per&s;ecuted. This lady, though warped by wrong pa&s;&s;ions, was naturally kind, judicious, and friend|ly. She found that all her attempts to &s;hake the con&s;tancy or the integrity of Sabinus were inef|fectual; &s;he had, therefore, begun to reflect, and to wonder, how &s;he could, &s;o long, and &s;o un|provoked, injure &s;uch uncommon fortitude and affection.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="220">She had, from the next room, her&s;elf heard the reception given to the me&s;&s;enger, and could not avoid feeling all the force of &s;uperior virtue; &s;he, therefore, rea&s;&s;umed her former goodne&s;s of heart; &s;he came into the room with tears in her eyes, and acknowledged the &s;everity of her former treatment. She be&s;towed her fir&s;t care in pro|viding them all the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies, and ac|knowledged them as the mo&s;t de&s;erving heirs of her fortune.

<P>Mr. Addi&s;on &s;tiles us a comic nation. In my opinion it is not acting the philo&s;opher on this point, to regard as a fault, that quality which contributes mo&s;t to the plea&s;ure of &s;ociety and happine&s;s of life. Plato, convinced that what|ever makes men happier, makes them better, advi&s;es to neglect nothing that may excite and convert to an early habit, this &s;en&s;e of joy in children. Seneca places it in the fir&s;t rank of good things. Certain it is, at lea&s;t, that gaiety may be a concomitant of all &s;orts of virtue, but that there are &s;ome vices with which it is in|compatible.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="223">As to him who laughs at every things, and him who laughs at nothing, neither of them has &s;ound judgment. All the difference I find between them is, that the la&s;t is con&s;tantly the mo&s;t un|happy. Tho&s;e who &s;peak again&s;t chearfulne&s;s, prove nothing el&s;e, but that they were born me|lancholic, and that in their hearts they rather envy than condemn that levity they affect to de&s;pi&s;e.</P>
<P>The Spectator, who&s;e con&s;tant object was the good of mankind in general, and of his own nation in particular, &s;hould, according to his own principles, place chearfulne&s;s among the mo&s;t de&s;irable qualities; and, probably, whenever he contradicts him&s;elf in this particular, it is only to conform to the tempers of the people whom he addre&s;&s;es. He a&s;&s;erts, that gaiety is one great ob&s;tacle to the prudent conduct of women. But are tho&s;e of a melancholic temper, as the Engli&s;h women generally are, le&s;s &s;ubject to the foibles of love? I am acquainted with &s;ome doctors in this &s;cience, to who&s;e judgment I would more willingly refer, than to his. And, perhaps, in reality, per&s;ons naturally of a gay temper, are too ea&s;ily taken off by different objects, to give them&s;elves up to all the exce&s;&s;es of this pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="224">Mr. Hobbes, a celebrated philo&s;opher of his nation, maintains, that laughing proceeds from our pride alone. This is only a paradox if a&s;|&s;erted of laughing in general, and only argues that mi&s;anthropical di&s;po&s;ition for which he was remarkable.</P>
<P>To bring the cau&s;es he a&s;&s;igns, for laughing, under &s;u&s;picion, it is &s;ufficient to remark, that proud people are commonly tho&s;e who laugh lea&s;t. Gravity is the in&s;eparable companion of pride. To &s;ay that a man is vain, becau&s;e the hu|mour of a writer, or the buffooneries of an har|lequin, excite his laughter, would be advancing a great ab&s;urdity. We &s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h between laughter, in&s;pired by joy, and that which ari&s;es from mockery. The malicious &s;neer is improperly called laughter. It mu&s;t be owned, that pride is the parent of &s;uch laughter as this; but this is in it&s;elf vicious; whereas, the other &s;ort has nothing in its principles or effects that de&s;erves condemnation. We find this amiable in others, and is it unhappine&s;s to feel a di&s;po&s;ition towards it in our&s;elves?</P>
<P>When I &s;ee an Engli&s;hman laugh, I fancy I rather &s;ee him hunting after joy, than having caught it; and this is more particularly remark|able in their women, who&s;e tempers are inclined to melancholy. A laugh leaves no more traces
<PB N="224" REF="225">
on their countenance than a fla&s;h of lightning on the face of the heavens. The mo&s;t laughing air is in&s;tantly &s;ucceeded by the mo&s;t gloomy. One would be apt to think that their &s;ouls open with difficulty to joy, or at lea&s;t that joy is not plea&s;ed with its habitation there.</P>
<P>In regard to fine raillery, it mu&s;t be allowed, that it is not natural to the Engli&s;h, and therefore tho&s;e who endeavour at it make but an ill figure. Some of their authors have candidly confe&s;&s;ed, that plea&s;antry is quite foreign to their character; but, according to the rea&s;on they give, they lo&s;e no|thing by this confe&s;&s;ion. Bi&s;hop Sprat gives the following one: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Engli&s;h (&s;ays he) have too much bravery to &s;ubmit to be derided, and too much virtue and honour to mock others</Q></P>

<HEAD>On DECEIT and FALSHOOD.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE>
<P>_THE following account is &s;o judi|ciou&s;ly conceived, that I am con|vinced the reader will be more plea&s;ed with it, than with any thing of mine, &s;o I &s;hall make no apology for this new publication.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the AUTHOR, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>DECEIT and fal&s;hood have ever been an over-match for truth, and followed and admired by the majority of mankind. If we enquire after the rea&s;on of this, we &s;hall find it
<PB N="226" REF="227">
in our own imaginations, which are amu&s;ed and entertained with the perpetual novelty and va|riety that fiction affords, but find no manner of delight in the uniform &s;implicity of homely truth, which &s;till &s;ues them under the &s;ame appearance.</P>
<P>He, therefore, that would gain our hearts, mu&s;t make his court to our fancy, which being &s;overeign comptroller of the pa&s;&s;ions, lets them loo&s;e, and enflames them more or le&s;s, in pro|portion to the force and efficacy of the fir&s;t cau&s;e, which is ever the more powerful the more new it is. Thus, in mathematical demon&s;trations them|&s;elves, though they &s;eem to aim at pure truth and in&s;truction, and to be addre&s;&s;ed to our rea&s;on alone, yet I think it is pretty plain, that our under&s;tanding is only made a drudge to gratify our invention and curio&s;ity, and we are plea&s;ed not &s;o much becau&s;e our di&s;coveries are certain, as becau&s;e they are new.</P>
<P>I do not deny but the world is &s;till plea&s;ed with things that plea&s;ed it many ages ago, but it &s;hould at the &s;ame time be con&s;idered, that man is naturally &s;o much of a logician, as to di&s;tin|gui&s;h between matters that are plain and ea&s;y, and others that are hard and inconceivable. What we under&s;tand, we overlook and de&s;pi&s;e, and what we know nothing of, we hug and delight in? Thus there are &s;uch things as perpetual no|velties;
<PB N="227" REF="228">
for we are plea&s;ed no longer than we are amazed, and nothing &s;o much contents us as that which confounds us.</P>
<P>This weakne&s;s in human nature, gave occa&s;ion to a party of men to make &s;uch gainful markets as they have done of our credulity. All objects and facts whatever, now cea&s;ed to be what they had been for ever before, and received what make and meaning it was found convenient to put upon them: What people eat, and drank, and &s;aw, was not what they eat, and drank, and &s;aw, but &s;omething farther, which they were fond of, be|cau&s;e they were ignorant of it. In &s;hort, nothing was it&s;elf, but &s;omething beyond it&s;elf; and by the&s;e artifices and amu&s;ements, the heads of the world were &s;o turned and intoxicated, that, at la&s;t, there was &s;carce a &s;ound &s;et of brains left in it.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of giddine&s;s and infatuation it was no very hard ta&s;k to per&s;uade the already deluded, that there was an actual &s;ociety and communion between human creatures and &s;piritual daemons. And when they had thus put people into the power and clutches of the devil, none but <HI>they alone</HI> could have either &s;kill or &s;trength to bring the pri&s;oners back again.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="229">But &s;o far did they carry this dreadful drollery, and &s;o fond were they of it, that to maintain it and them&s;elves in profitable repute, they literally &s;acrificed for it, and made impious victims of numberle&s;s old women, and other mi&s;erable per|&s;ons, who either through ignorance could not &s;ay what they were bid to &s;ay, or, through madne&s;s, &s;aid what they &s;hould not have &s;aid. Fear and &s;tupidity made them incapable of defending them|&s;elves, and frenzy and infatuation made them confe&s;s <HI>guilty impo&s;&s;ibilities,</HI> which produced cruel &s;entences, and then inhuman executions.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e wretched mortals finding them|&s;elves either hateful or terrible to all, and be|friended by none, and, perhaps, wanting the common nece&s;&s;aries of life, came at la&s;t, to ab|hor them&s;elves as much as they were abhorred by others, and grew willing to be burnt or hanged out of a world, which was no other to them than a &s;cene of per&s;ecution and angui&s;h.</P>
<P>Others, of &s;trong imaginations and little un|der&s;tandings, were by po&s;itive and repeated charges again&s;t them, of committing mi&s;chievous and &s;upernatural facts and villainies, <HI>deluded</HI> to judge of them&s;elves by the judgment of their enemies, who&s;e weakne&s;s or malice prompted them to be accu&s;ers. And many have been condemned as witches and dealers with the devil, for no other
<PB N="229" REF="230">
rea&s;on but their knowing more than tho&s;e who accu&s;ed, tried, and pa&s;&s;ed &s;entence upon them.</P>
<P>In the&s;e ca&s;es, credulity is a much greater error than infidelity, and it is &s;afer to believe nothing than too much. A man that believes little or nothing of witchcraft, will de&s;troy nobody for being under the imputation of it; and &s;o far he certainly acts with humanity to others, and &s;afety to him&s;elf: But he that credits all, or too much, upon that article, is obliged, if he acts con&s;i&s;tently with his per&s;ua&s;ion, to kill all tho&s;e whom he takes to be the killers of mankind; and &s;uch are witches. It would be a je&s;t and a contradiction to &s;ay, that he is for &s;paring them who are harmle&s;s of that tribe, &s;ince the received notion of their &s;uppo&s;ed contract with the devil, implies that they are engaged by covenant and inclination to do all the mi&s;chief they po&s;&s;ibly can.</P>
<P>I have heard many &s;tories of witches, and read many accu&s;ations again&s;t them, but I do not re|member any that would have induced me to have con&s;igned over to the halter or the flame, any of tho&s;e deplorable wretches, who, as they &s;hare our likene&s;s and nature, ought to &s;hare our compa&s;|&s;ion, as per&s;ons cruelly accu&s;ed of impo&s;&s;ibilities.</P>
<P>But we love to delude our&s;elves, and often fancy or forge an effect, and then &s;et our&s;elves as
<PB N="230" REF="231">
gravely, as ridiculou&s;ly, to find out the cau&s;e. Thus, for example, when a dream or the hyp has given us fal&s;e terrors, or imaginary pains, we immediately conclude, that the infernal tyrant owes us a &s;pite, and inflicts his wrath and &s;tripes upon us, by the hands of &s;ome of his &s;worn &s;ervants among&s;t us. For this end an old woman is promoted to a &s;eat in <HI>Satan</HI>'s privy council, and appointed his executioner in chief, within her di&s;trict. So ready and civil are we to allow the devil the dominion over us, and even to provide him with butchers and hangmen of our own make and nature.</P>
<P>I have often wondered why we did not, in chu&s;ing our proper officers for <HI>Belzebub,</HI> lay the lot rather upon men than women, the former being more bold and robu&s;t, and more equal to that bloody &s;ervice; but, upon enquiry, I find it has been &s;o ordered for two rea&s;ons; fir&s;t, the men having the whole direction of this affair, are wi&s;e enough to &s;lip their own necks out of the collar; and, &s;econdly, an old woman is grown by cu&s;tom the mo&s;t avoided and mo&s;t unpitied creature under the &s;un, the very name carrying contempt and &s;atire in it. And &s;o far, indeed, we pay but an uncourtly &s;ort of re&s;pect to <HI>Satan</HI> in &s;acrificing to him nothing but the dry &s;ticks of human nature.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="232">We have a <HI>wondering quality</HI> within us, which finds huge gratification when we &s;ee &s;trange &s;eats done, and cannot at the &s;ame time &s;ee the doer, or the cau&s;e. Such actions are &s;ure to be attribu|ted to &s;ome witch or daemon; for if we come to find they are &s;lily performed by arti&s;ts of our own &s;pecies, and by cau&s;es purely natural, our delight dies with our amazement.</P>
<P>It is therefore one of the mo&s;t unthankful of|fices in the world, to go about to expo&s;e the mi|&s;taken notions of witchcraft and &s;pirits; it is robbing mankind of a valuable imagination, and of the privilege of being deceived. Tho&s;e who at any time undertook the ta&s;k, have always met with rough treatment and ill language for their pains, and &s;eldom e&s;caped the imputation of athe|i&s;m, becau&s;e they would not allow the devil to be too powerful for the Almighty. For my part, I am &s;o much a heretick as to believe, that God Almighty, and not the devil, governs the world.</P>
<P>If we enquire what are the common marks and &s;ymptoms by which witches are di&s;covered to be &s;uch, we &s;hall &s;ee how rea&s;onably and mercifully tho&s;e poor creatures were burnt and hanged, who unhappily fell under that name.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="233">In the fir&s;t place, the old woman mu&s;t be pro|digious ugly; her eyes hollow and red, her face &s;hrivelled; &s;he goes double, and her voice trem|bles. It frequently happens, that this rueful figure frightens a child into the palpitation of the heart: Home he runs, and tells his in mamma, that goody &s;uch a one looked at him, and he is very ill. The good woman cries out, her dear baby is bewitched, and &s;ends for the par&s;on and the con&s;table.</P>
<P>It is moreover nece&s;&s;ary, that &s;he be very poor. It is true, her ma&s;ter <HI>Satan</HI> has mines and hidden trea&s;ures in his gift; but no matter, &s;he is for all that very poor, and lives on alms. She goes to <HI>Si&s;ly</HI> the cook maid for a di&s;h of broth, or the heel of a loaf, and <HI>Si&s;ly</HI> denies them to her. The old woman goes away muttering, and, perhaps, in le&s;s than a month's time <HI>Si&s;ly</HI> hears the voice of a cat, and &s;trains her ancles, which are certain &s;igns that &s;he is bewitched.</P>
<P>A farmer &s;ees his cattle die of the murrain, and the &s;heep of the rot, and poor goody is forced to be the cau&s;e of their death, becau&s;e &s;he was &s;een talking to her&s;elf the evening before &s;uch an ewe departed, and had been gathering &s;ticks at the &s;ide of the wood where &s;uch a cow run mad.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="234">The old woman has always for her companion an old grey cat, which is a di&s;gui&s;ed devil too, and confederate with goody in works of darkne&s;s. They frequently go journies into <HI>Egypt</HI> upon a broom-&s;taff, in half an hour's time, and now and then goody and her cat change &s;hapes. The neighbours often over-hear them in deep and &s;o|lemn di&s;cour&s;e together, plotting &s;ome dreadful mi&s;chief, you may be &s;ure.</P>
<P>There is a famous way of trying witches, re|commended by king <HI>James</HI> I. The old woman is tied hand and foot, and thrown into the river, and if &s;he &s;wims &s;he is guilty, and taken out and burnt; but if &s;he is innocent, &s;he &s;inks, and is <HI>only</HI> drowned.</P>
<P>The witches are &s;aid to meet their ma&s;ter fre|quently in churches and church-yards. I wonder at the boldne&s;s of <HI>Satan</HI> and his congregation, in revelling and playing mountebank farces on con|&s;ecrated ground; and I have as often wondered at the over&s;ight and ill policy of &s;ome people in al|lowing it po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>It would have been both dangerous and impious to have treated this &s;ubject at one certain time in this ludicrous manner. It u&s;ed to be managed with all po&s;&s;ible gravity, and even terror; and, indeed, it was made a tragedy in all its parts,
<PB N="234" REF="235">
and thou&s;ands were &s;acrificed, or rather mur|dered, by &s;uch evidence and colours, as, God be thanked, we are at this day a&s;hamed of. An old woman may be <HI>mi&s;erable now,</HI> and not be <HI>hanged</HI> for it.</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE AUGUSTAN AGE of England.</HEAD>
<P>THE hi&s;tory of the ri&s;e of language and learning is calculated to gratify curio&s;ity, rather than to &s;atisfy the under&s;tanding. An ac|count of that period only, when language and learning arrived at its highe&s;t perfection, is the mo&s;t conducive to real improvement, &s;ince it at once rai&s;es emulation, and directs to the proper objects. The age of Leo X. in Italy, is con|fe&s;&s;ed to be the Agu&s;tan age with them. The French writers &s;eem agreed to give the &s;ame ap|pellation to that of Lewis XIV. but the Engli&s;h are yet undetermined with re&s;pect to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Some have looked upon the writers in the times of Queen Elizabeth as the true &s;tandard for future imitation; others have de&s;cended to the reign of James I. and others &s;till lower, to that of Charles II. Were I to be permitted to offer an opinion upon this &s;ubject, I &s;hould readily
<PB N="236" REF="237">
give my vote for the reign of Queen Anne, or &s;ome years before that period. It was then that ta&s;te was united to genius, and, as before, our writers charmed with their &s;trength of thinking, &s;o then they plea&s;ed with &s;trength and grace united. In that period of Briti&s;h glory, though no writer attracts our attention &s;ingly, yet, like &s;tars lo&s;t in each others brightne&s;s, they have ca&s;t &s;uch a lu&s;tre upon the age in which they lived, that their minute&s;t tran&s;actions will be attended to by po|&s;terity with a greater eagerne&s;s than the mo&s;t im|portant occurrences of even empires, which have been tran&s;acted in greater ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>At that period there &s;eemed to be a ju&s;t balance between patronage and the pre&s;s. Before it, men were little e&s;teemed who&s;e only merit was genius; and &s;ince, men who can prudently be content to catch the public, are certain of living without dependance. But the writers of the period of which I am &s;peaking, were &s;ufficiently e&s;teemed by the great, and not rewarded enough by book&s;ellers, to &s;et them above independance. Fame con&s;equently then was the true&s;t road to happine&s;s; a &s;edulous attention to the mechanical bu&s;ine&s;s of the day makes the pre&s;ent never-failing re&s;ource.</P>
<P>The age of Charles II. which our countrymen term the age of wit and immorality, produced
<PB N="237" REF="238">
&s;ome writers that at once &s;erved to improve our language and corrupt our hearts. The King him&s;elf had a large &s;hare of knowledge, and &s;ome wit, and his courtiers were generally men who had been brought up in the &s;chool of affliction and experience. For this rea&s;on, when the &s;un|&s;hine of their fortune returned, they gave too great a loo&s;e to plea&s;ure, and language was by them cultivated only as a mode of elegance. Hence, it became more enervated, and was da&s;hed with quaintne&s;&s;es which gave the public writings of tho&s;e times a very illiberal air.</P>
<P>Le&s;trange, who was by no means &s;o bad a a writer as &s;ome have repre&s;ented him, was &s;unk in party faction, and having generally the wor&s;t &s;ide of the argument, often had recour&s;e to &s;cold|ing, pertne&s;s, and, con&s;equently, a vulgarity that di&s;covers it&s;elf even in his more liberal com|po&s;itions. Her was the fir&s;t writer who regularly enli&s;ted him&s;elf under the banners of a party for pay, and fought for it through right and wrong for upwards of forty literary campaigns. This intrepidity gained him the e&s;teem of Cromwell him&s;elf, and the papers he wrote even ju&s;t before the revolution, almo&s;t with the rope about his neck, have his u&s;ual characters of impudence and per&s;everance. That he was a &s;tandard-writer cannot be di&s;owned, becau&s;e a great many very eminent authors formed their &s;tile by his. But his
<PB N="238" REF="239">
&s;tandard was far from being a ju&s;t one; though, when party con&s;iderations are &s;et a&s;ide, he cer|tainly was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of elegance, ea&s;e and per|&s;picuity.</P>
<P>Dryden, though a great and indi&s;puted genius, had the &s;ame ca&s;t as Le&s;trange. Even his plays di&s;cover him to be a party-man, and the &s;ame principle in&s;ects his &s;tile in &s;ubjects of the lighte&s;t nature; but the Engli&s;h tongue, as it &s;tands at pre&s;ent, is greatly his debtor. He fir&s;t gave it regular harmony, and di&s;covered its latent powers. It was his pen that formed the Congreves, the Priors, and the Addi&s;ons, who &s;ucceeded him; and had it not been for Dryden, we never &s;hould have known a Pope, at lea&s;t in the meridian lu&s;tre he now di&s;plays. But Dryden's excellencies, as a writer, were not confined to poetry alone. There is in his pro&s;e writings an ea&s;e and elegance that have never yet been &s;o well united in works of ta&s;te or critici&s;m.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h language owes very little to Otway, though, next to Shake&s;peare, the greate&s;t genius England ever produced in tragedy. His excellen|cies lay in painting directly from nature, in catch|ing every emotion ju&s;t as it ri&s;es from the &s;oul, and in all the powers of the moving and pathetic. He appears to have had no learning, no critical knowledge, and to have lived in great di&s;tre&s;s.
<PB N="239" REF="240">
When he died, (which he did in an ob&s;cure hou&s;e near the Minories) he had about him the copy of a tragedy, which it &s;eems he had &s;old for a trifle to Bentley the book&s;eller. I have &s;een an adver|ti&s;ement at the end of one of Le&s;trange's political papers, offering a reward to any one who &s;hould bring it to his &s;hop. What an invaluable trea&s;ure was there irretrievably lo&s;t, by the ignorance and neglect of the age he lived in.</P>
<P>Lee had a great command of language, and va&s;t force of expre&s;&s;ion, both which the be&s;t of our &s;ucceeding dramatic poets thought proper to take for their models. Rowe, in particular, &s;eems to have caught that manner, though, in all other re&s;pects, inferior. The other poets of that reign contributed but little towards improving the Engli&s;h tongue, and it is not certain whether they did not injure rather than improve it. Immorality has its cant as well as party, and many &s;hocking expre&s;&s;ions now crept into the language, and be|came the tran&s;ient fa&s;hion of the day. The upper galleries, by the prevalence of party-&s;pirit, were courted with great a&s;&s;iduity, and a hor&s;e-laugh following ribaldry, was the highe&s;t in&s;tance of applau&s;e, the cha&s;tity as well as energy of diction being overlooked, or neglected.</P>
<P>Virtuous &s;entiment was recovered, but energy of &s;tile never was. This, though di&s;regarded in
<PB N="240" REF="241">
plays and party-writings, &s;till prevailed among&s;t men of character and bu&s;ine&s;s. The di&s;patches of Sir Richard Fan&s;haw, Sir Wilham Godolphin, Lord Arlington, and many other mini&s;ters of &s;tate, are all of them, with re&s;pect to diction, manly, bold and nervous. Sir William Temple, though a man of no learning, had great knowlege and experience. He wrote always like a man of &s;en&s;e and a gentleman, and his &s;tile is the model by which the be&s;t pro&s;e writers in the reign of Queen Anne, formed theirs. The beauties of Mr. Locke's &s;tile, though not &s;o much celebrated, are as &s;triking as that of his under&s;tanding. He never &s;ays more nor le&s;s than he ought, and never makes u&s;e of a word that he could have changed for a better. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation holds good of Dr. Samuel Clarke.</P>
<P>Mr. Locke was a philo&s;opher, his antagoni&s;t Stillingfleet, Bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, was a man of learning, and therefore the conte&s;t between them was unequal. The clearne&s;s of Mr. Locke's head renders his language per&s;picuous, the learning of Stillingfleet's clouds his. This is an in&s;tance of the &s;uperiority of good &s;en&s;e over learning, to|wards the improvement of every language.</P>
<P>There is nothing peculiar to the language of Archbi&s;hop Tillot&s;on, but his manner of writing is inimitable; for one who reads him, wonders
<PB N="241" REF="242">
why he him&s;elf did not think and &s;peak in that very manner. The turn of his periods is agree|able, tho' artle&s;s, and every thing he &s;ays &s;eems to flow &s;pontaneou&s;ly from inward conviction. Bar|row, tho' greatly his &s;uperior in learning, falls &s;hort of him in other re&s;pects.</P>
<P>The time &s;eems to be at hand, when ju&s;tice will be done to Mr. Cowley's pro&s;e, as well as poetical writings; and tho' his friend Doctor Sprat, Bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, in his diction, falls far &s;hort of the abilities for which he has been celebrated; yet, there is &s;ometimes an happy flow in his periods, &s;omething that looks like eloquence. The &s;tile of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or Atterbury, has been much commended by his friends, which always happens when a man di&s;tingui&s;hes him&s;elf in party, but there is in it nothing extraordinary. Even the &s;peech which he made for him&s;elf at the bar of the hou&s;e of Lords, before he was &s;ent into exile, is void of eloquence, tho' it has been cry'd up by his friends to &s;uch a degree, that his enemies have &s;uffered it to pa&s;s uncen&s;ured.</P>
<P>The philo&s;ophical manner of Lord Shafte&s;bury's writing, is nearer to that of Cicero, than any Engli&s;h author has yet arrived at, but, perhaps, had Cicero wrote in Engli&s;h, his compo&s;ition would have greatly exceeded that of our country|man. The diction of the latter is beautiful, but
<PB N="242" REF="243">
&s;uch beauty, as upon nearer in&s;pection, carries with it evident &s;ymptoms of affectation. This has been attended with very di&s;agreeable con&s;e|quences. Nothing is &s;o ea&s;y to copy as affectation, and his Lord&s;hip's rank and fame have procured him more imitators in Britain than any other wri|ter I know; all faithfully pre&s;erving his blemi&s;hes, but, unhappily, not one of his beauties.</P>
<P>Mr. Trenchard and Dr. Davenant were political writers of great abilities in diction, and their pamphlets are now &s;tandards in that way of wri|ting. They were followed by Dean Swift, who, tho' in other re&s;pects far their &s;uperior, never could ari&s;e to that manline&s;s and clearne&s;s of dic|tion in political writing, for which they were &s;o ju&s;tly famous.</P>
<P>They were all of them exceeded by the late Lord Bolingbroke, who&s;e &s;trength lay in that pro|vince; for as a philo&s;opher and a critic he was ill qualified, being de&s;titute of virtue for the one, and of learning for the other. His writings again&s;t Sir Robert Walpole, are incomparably the be&s;t part of his works. The per&s;onal and perpetual antipathy he had for that family, to who&s;e places he thought his own abilities had a right, gave a glow to his &s;tile, and an edge to his manner, that never has been yet equalled in political writing. His misfortunes and di&s;appointments gave his mind a turn, which his friends mi&s;took for philo&s;ophy,
<PB N="243" REF="244">
and at one time of his life he had the art to impo&s;e the &s;ame belief upon &s;ome of his enemies. His His idea of a patriot King, which I reckon (as indeed it was) among&s;t his writings again&s;t Sir Robert Walpole, is a ma&s;ter-piece of diction. Even in his other works his &s;tile is excellent; but where a man either does not, or will not under|&s;tand the &s;ubject he writes on, there mu&s;t always be a deficiency. In politics, he was generally ma&s;ter of what he undertook, in morals never.</P>
<P>Mr. Addi&s;on, for a happy and natural &s;tile, will be always an honour to Briti&s;h literature. His diction indeed wants &s;trength, but it is equal to all the &s;ubjects he undertakes to handle, as he never (at lea&s;t in his fini&s;hed works) attempts any thing either in the argumentative or demon&s;trative way.</P>
<P>Tho' Sir Richard Steele's reputation as a public writer, was owing to his connections with Mr. Addi&s;on, yet, after their intimacy was formed, Steele &s;unk in his merit as an author. This was not owing &s;o much to the evident &s;uperiority on the part of Addi&s;on, as to the unnatural efforts which Steele made to equal or eclip&s;e him. This emulation de&s;troyed that genuine flow of diction which is di&s;coverable in all his former compo&s;itions.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t their writings engaged attention, and the favour of the public, reiterated but un&s;ucce&s;sful en|deavours
<PB N="244" REF="245">
were made towards forming a grammar of the Engli&s;h language. The authors of tho&s;e ef|forts went upon wrong principles. In&s;tead of endea|vouring to retrench the ab&s;urdities of our language, and bringing it to a certain criterion, their gram|mars were no other than a collection of rules at|tempting to naturalize tho&s;e ab&s;urdities, and bring them under a regular &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Somewhat effectual, however, might have been done towards fixing the &s;tandard of the Engli&s;h language, had it not been for the &s;pirit of party. For both <HI>whigs</HI> and <HI>tories</HI> being ambitious to &s;tand at the head of &s;o great a de&s;ign, the Queen's death happened before any plan of an academy could be re&s;olved on.</P>
<P>Mean while, the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch an in&s;titution became every day more apparent. The periodical and political writers which then &s;warmed, adopted the very wor&s;t manner of Le&s;trange, till not only all decency, but all propriety of language, was lo&s;t in the nation. Le&s;ly, a pert writer, with &s;ome wit and learning, in&s;ulted the government every week with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t abu&s;e. His &s;tile and manner, both of which were illiberal, was imitated by Ridpath, De Foe, Dunton, and others of the oppo&s;ite party, and Toland pleaded the cau&s;e of athei&s;m and immorality in much the &s;ame &s;train; his &s;ubject &s;eemed to deba&s;e his diction, and he
<PB N="245" REF="246">
ever failed mo&s;t in one, when he grew mo&s;t licen|tious in the other.</P>
<P>Towards the end of Queen Anne's reign, &s;ome of the greate&s;t men in England, devoted their time to party, and then a much better manner obtained in political writing. Mr. Walpole, Mr. Addi&s;on, Mr. Mainwaring, Mr. Steele, and many members of both hou&s;es of parliament, drew their pens for the whigs; but they &s;eem to have been over-matched, tho' not in argument, yet in wri|ting, by Bolingbroke, Prior, Swift, Arbuthnot, and the other friends of the oppo&s;ite party. They who oppo&s;e a mini&s;try, have always a better field for ridicule and reproof, than they who defend it.</P>
<P>Since that period, our writers have either been encouraged above their merits or below them. Some, who were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the meane&s;t abilities, acquired the highe&s;t preferments, while others, who &s;eemed born to reflect a lu&s;tre upon their age, peri&s;hed by want and neglect. More, Savage, and Amher&s;t, were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great abilities, yet they were &s;uffered to feel all the mi&s;eries that u&s;ually attend the ingenious and the imprudent, that attend men of &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, and no phleg|matic re&s;erve in their command.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, were a man to attempt to improve his fortune, or encrea&s;e his friend&s;hip by poetry,
<PB N="246" REF="247">
he would &s;oon feel the anxiety of di&s;appointment. The pre&s;s lies open, and is a benefactor to every fort of literature, but that alone.</P>
<P>I am at a lo&s;s whether to a&s;cribe this falling off of the public to a vicous ta&s;te in the poet, or in them. Perhaps, both are to be reprehended. The poet either drily didactive, gives us rules, which might appear ab&s;tru&s;e even in a &s;y&s;tem of ethics, or tri|flingly volatile writes upon the mo&s;t unworthy &s;ubjects. Content, if he can give mu&s;ic in&s;tead of &s;en&s;e; content, if he can paint to the imagina|tion without any de&s;ires or endeavours to affect; the public, therefore, with ju&s;tice di&s;card &s;uch empty &s;ound, which has nothing but jingle, or what is wor&s;e, the unmu&s;ical flow of blank ver&s;e, to recommend it. The late method al&s;o that our news papers have fallen into, of giving an epitome of every new publication, mu&s;t greatly damp the writer's genius. He finds him&s;elf in this ca&s;e at the mercy of men, who have neither abilities nor learning to di&s;tingui&s;h his merit. He finds his own compo&s;itions mixed with the &s;ordid tra&s;h of every daily &s;cribbler. There is a &s;ufficient &s;pecimen gi|ven of his work to abate curio&s;ity, and yet &s;o mu|tilated as to render him contemptible. His fir&s;t, and, perhaps, his &s;econd work, by this means &s;ink, among the crudities of the age, into oblivion. Fame, he finds, begin to turn her back; he there|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ore flies to profit which invites him, and he enrols
<PB N="247" REF="248">
him&s;elf in the li&s;ts of dulne&s;s and of avarice, for life.</P>
<P>Yet there are &s;till among us men of the greate&s;t abilities, and who, in &s;ome parts of learning, have &s;urpa&s;&s;ed their predece&s;&s;ors: Ju&s;tice and friend&s;hip might here impel me to &s;peak of names which will &s;hine out to all po&s;terity, but prudence re&s;trains me from what I &s;hould otherwi&s;e eagerly embrace. Envy might ri&s;e again&s;t every honoured name I &s;hould mention, &s;ince &s;carce one of them has not tho&s;e who are his enemies, or tho&s;e who de&s;pi&s;e him, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE OPERA in ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<P>THE ri&s;e and fall of our amu&s;ements pretty much re&s;embles that of empire. They this day flouri&s;h without any vi&s;ible cau&s;e for &s;uch vi|gour; the next they decay away, without any rea&s;on that can be a&s;&s;igned for their downfall. Some years ago the Italian opera was the only fa|&s;hionable amu&s;ement among our nobility. The managers of the playhou&s;es dreaded it as a mortal enemy, and our very poets li&s;ted them&s;elves in the oppo&s;ition; at pre&s;ent, the hou&s;e &s;eems de&s;erted, the ca&s;trati&s;ing to empty benches, even Prince Vologe&s;e him&s;elf, a youth of great expectations, &s;ings him&s;elf out of breath, and rattles his chain to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>To &s;ay the truth, the opera, as it is conducted among us, is but a very humdrum amu&s;ement; in other countries, the decorations are entirely mag|nificent, the &s;ingers all excellent, and the burlettas or interludes, quite entertaining; the be&s;t poets compo&s;e the words, and the be&s;t ma&s;ters the mu&s;ic, but with us it is otherwi&s;e; the decorations are but trifling, and cheap; the &s;ingers, Matei only excepted, but indifferent. In&s;tead of interlude, we have tho&s;e &s;orts of &s;kipping dances, which are cal|culated for the galleries of the theatre. Every per|former
<PB N="249" REF="250">
&s;ings his favourite &s;ong, and the mu&s;ic is only a medly of old Italian airs, or &s;ome meagre modern Capricio.</P>
<P>When &s;uch is the ca&s;e, it is not much to be wondered, if the opera is pretty much neglected; the lower orders of people have neither ta&s;te nor fortune to reli&s;h &s;uch an entertainment; they would find more &s;atisfaction in the <HI>Roa&s;t Beef of Old England,</HI> than in the fine&s;t clo&s;es of an eunuch, they &s;leep amid&s;t all the agony of recitative: On the other hand, people of fortune or ta&s;te, can hardly be plea&s;ed where there is a vi&s;ible poverty in the decorations, and an entire want of ta&s;te in the compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Would it not &s;urprize one, that when Meta&s;ta&s;io is &s;o well known in England, and &s;o univer&s;ally ad|mired, the manager or the compo&s;er &s;hould have recour&s;e to any other operas than tho&s;e written by him. I might venture to &s;ay, that <HI>written by Meta&s;ta&s;io,</HI> put up in the bills of the day, would alone be &s;ufficient to fill an hou&s;e, &s;ince thus, the admirers of &s;en&s;e as well as &s;ound, might find en|tertainment.</P>
<P>The performers al&s;o &s;hould be entreated to &s;ing only their parts, without clapping in any of their own favourite airs. I mu&s;t own, that &s;uch &s;ongs are generally to me the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable in the
<PB N="250" REF="251">
world. Every &s;inger generally chu&s;es a favourite air, not from the excellency of the mu&s;ic, but from the difficulty; &s;uch &s;ongs are generally cho&s;en as &s;urprize rather than plea&s;e, where the performer may &s;hew his compa&s;s, his breath, and his volu|bility.</P>
<P>From hence proceed tho&s;e unnatural &s;tartings, tho&s;e unmu&s;ical clo&s;ings, and &s;hakes lengthened out to a painful continuance; &s;uch, indeed, may &s;hew a voice, but it mu&s;t give a truly delicate ear the utmo&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s. Such tricks are not mu&s;ic; neither Corelli nor Pergole&s;i ever permitted them, and they begin even to be di&s;continued in Italy, where they fir&s;t had their ri&s;e.</P>
<P>And now I am upon the &s;ubject: Our compo|&s;ers al&s;o &s;hould affect greater &s;implicity, let their ba&s;e cliff have all the variety they can give it; let the body of the mu&s;ic (if I may &s;o expre&s;s it) be as various as they plea&s;e, but let them avoid orna|menting a barren ground work; let them not at|tempt, by flouri&s;hing, to cheat us of &s;olid harmony.</P>
<P>The works of Mr. Rameau are never heard without a &s;urprizing effect. I can attribute it only to this &s;implicity he every where ob&s;erves, in&s;o|much, that &s;ome of his fine&s;t harmonies are often only octave and uni&s;on. This &s;imple manner has greater powers than is generally imagined; and
<PB N="251" REF="252">
were not &s;uch a demon&s;tration mi&s;placed, I think, from the principles of mu&s;ic, it might be proved to be mo&s;t agreeable.</P>
<P>But to leave general reflection. With the pre|&s;ent &s;et of performers, the operas, if the con|ductor thinks proper, may be carried on with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s, &s;ince they have all &s;ome merit; if not as actors, at lea&s;t as &s;ingers. Signora Matei is at once both a perfect actre&s;s and a very fine &s;inger. She is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a fine &s;en&s;ibility in her manner, and &s;eldom indulges tho&s;e extravagant and un|mu&s;ical flights of voice complained of before. Cornacini, on the other hand, is a very indifferent actor; has a mo&s;t unmeaning face; &s;eems not to feel his part; is infected with a pa&s;&s;ion of &s;hewing his compa&s;s; but to recompence all the&s;e defects, his voice is melodious; he has va&s;t compa&s;s and great volubility; his &s;well and &s;hake are perfectly fine, unle&s;s that he continues the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tter too long. In &s;hort, whatever the defects of his action may be, they are amply recompenced by his excellency as a &s;inger; nor can I avoid fancying that he might make a much greater figure in an oratorio, than upon the &s;tage.</P>
<P>However, upon the whole, I know not whether ever operas can be kept up in England; they &s;eem to be entirely exotic, and require the nice&s;t ma|nagement and care. In&s;tead of this, the care of
<PB N="252" REF="253">
them is a&s;&s;igned to men unacquainted with the genius and di&s;po&s;ition of the people they would amu&s;e, and who&s;e only motives are immediate gain. Whether a di&s;continuance of &s;uch entertain|ments would be more to the lo&s;s or the advantage of the nation, I will not take upon me to deter|mine, &s;ince it is as much our intere&s;t to induce foreigners of ta&s;te among us on the one hand, as it is to di&s;courage tho&s;e trifling members of &s;ociety, who generally compo&s;e the operatical <HI>dramatis per&s;onae</HI> on the other.</P>
