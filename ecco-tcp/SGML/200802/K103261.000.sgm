<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>READER, if thou art a man of the world, this book will not plea&s;e thee&mdash;it was written by tho&s;e who were ab&s;tracted from mankind, and had little reli&s;h for either the ribaldry or amu&s;e|ments
<PB N="vii" REF="7">
of the pre&s;ent times.&mdash;Mr. Paulet was a clergyman un|knowing in the world, and unknown to all but men like him&s;elf&mdash;the lat|ter part of his life he read mankind chiefly in his &s;tudy; for it was his unhappy fate, whenever he wi&s;hed to take a wider range, to experience little more than their fal&s;ehood or infidelity.&mdash;His &s;on, by becoming a private
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
tutor in town for a while, afforded him frequent opportunities of hearing what follies were mo&s;t predominant; and from his own letters, perhaps, it may not be incurious to trace the decent &s;obriety of the character of the old Engli&s;h gentleman, when compared with the inflated maxims of the modern Indian innovator.&mdash;The daughter's corre&s;pondence likewi&s;e will not be totally unin|&s;tructive,
<PB N="x" REF="9">
as it may afford &s;ome re|markable in&s;tances of the great changes that, in a &s;hort time, may be brought about from the pre|valence of Manners over Laws, Principles, and Morality.&mdash;It may be ju&s;tly urged, perhaps, that Mr. Paulet &s;aw every thing through a contracted medium; but, however, the mind is tempered by virtue, or harmonized by religion,
<PB N="xi" REF="10">
I fear there are few good men who can &s;urvey the &s;cenes that are continually &s;hifting before them, without acrimony or di&s;gu&s;t.&mdash;The mind of man in &s;olitude is torpid and inactive, but when ca&s;t on the ocean of life, it is di&s;&s;ipated and infirm&mdash;re&s;tle&s;s in the pur&s;uit of &s;ome hidden good, it wears out its &s;en&s;ibility by perpetual motion; and confined within the limits of an
<PB N="xii" REF="11">
unextended empire, it contracts it|&s;elf, and becomes gloomy and de&s;|pondent.</P>

<P>AT four o'clock this afternoon I was again &s;ent for, not to pray by him, but (at my own reque&s;t) to pay the la&s;t tribute to expiring friend|&s;hip&mdash;He had no orders to give about either his plumes or his monu|ment&mdash;"If I have lived well, &s;aid he, my deeds will be graven on the minds of men, and I &s;hall have the ble&s;&s;ings of the de&s;erving&mdash;let the poor be decently &s;upplied on the oc|ca&s;ion with all nece&s;&s;aries, and if

they loved me, they will not wi&s;h for &s;uperfluities&mdash;I have ever been their protector, and they would not, I am &s;ure, convert my funeral into an hour of fe&s;tivity&mdash;I feel an awe, but no grief, at my di&s;&s;olution&mdash;&s;ome philo&s;ophers, it is &s;aid, have been above terrors, but I fear they were below humanity&mdash;to &s;hudder is the part of the guilty, to &s;tand un|di&s;mayed is the language of the Sto|ic, to be humble is the duty of a man&mdash;before the mortification took place, I had need of all my re&s;olution, but I hope in tho&s;e moments I con|fe&s;&s;ed virtue on the rack, and &s;uffered torture only to refine my ore from its dro&s;s&mdash;There is, I am convinced of it, now a counterpoi&s;e to all human mi|&s;ery&mdash;&s;ome hidden re&s;ource which
<PB N="4" REF="15">
the mind can be&s;t &s;upply at its utmo&s;t exigency&mdash;I feel it now, and &s;hould think it ill exchanged for all that titles, wealth, fortune, or power could be|&s;tow upon me, and tho' I am journey|ing apace to that undi&s;covered coun|try, from which I never &s;hall return, I would not wi&s;h for one hour of added life for aught but for my friends, among&s;t whom, my deare&s;t Paulet, I have ever principally e&s;teem|ed you&mdash;thus &s;aying, he pre&s;&s;ed ea|gerly my hand, looked fervently to heaven&mdash;&s;ighed&mdash;and expired.&mdash;A &s;cene like this awakened all my feel|ings, and for &s;ome moments I expe|rienced an awful &s;omething without a name&mdash;tears and grief had nearly overwhelmed me, but I have again recovered my tranquillity, for it would
<PB N="5" REF="16">
ill become me to fall a victim to di&s;|tre&s;s, when my life and my profe&s;&s;ion demand me to make u&s;e of its in&s;truc|tion&mdash;I have gained by his death a trial of that fortitude, which I hope I have not altogether di&s;graced&mdash;what I have lo&s;t you can ea&s;ily re|count with me&mdash;He was a man, (for I mu&s;t ever dwell on his character) who, though he had experienced all the fal&s;ehood of a bad world, had ne|ver &s;teeled his heart again&s;t the feel|ings of humanity&mdash;he was benevolent without vanity, and generous with|out o&s;tentation&mdash;he had a heart, per|haps, too &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;oft impre&s;|&s;ions, which ever laid him open to the de&s;igns of the artful and di&s;ingenu|ous, &s;o that from the &s;uperiority of his under&s;tanding he derived a weak|ne&s;s
<PB N="6" REF="17">
in his worldly conduct&mdash;he was warm in his re&s;entments, but, le&s;t he &s;hould be behind hand in reparation, paid always over price&mdash;he was &s;kill|ed in all the nece&s;&s;ary truths of the religion he profe&s;&s;ed, and it was no inferior branch of his knowledge, that he was ever willing to remain igno|rant of tho&s;e deeper my&s;teries which its divine Author thought fit to con|ceal from him&mdash;he was to me a pa|tron, a benefactor, and a friend, a friend that&mdash;but I will here clo&s;e the &s;ubject, entreating you, my deare&s;t Charles, to withdraw frequently from the bu&s;y &s;cenes of life to contemplate the character of a man, which may add fervour to virtue, zeal to religion, and confidence to truth.</P>

<P>FOR all what Mr. Pope &s;ays&mdash;that people never want to receive let|ters but from London, I have the va|nity to think you'll be glad to hear from me, tho' confined in this gloom of &s;olitude&mdash;We have had a &s;ad dull winter of it; my father being &s;till quite moped for the death of poor Mr. Arlington: indeed he is a great lo&s;s to us all, but we hope &s;oon to have ample amends made us by the great man that has ju&s;t purcha&s;ed his e&s;tate&mdash;he came down ye&s;terday for the fir&s;t time to view it, for he bought it only from the fine de&s;cription that was given of it by the great auctioneer in London&mdash;his name is Ma&s;&s;em&mdash;he has a &s;i&s;ter who is come to that time

<P>I Hope you would not &s;uppo&s;e that either the diver&s;ions of town, or the dignity of my new character as pre|ceptor,
<PB N="10" REF="21">
would &s;o entirely engro&s;s my attention, as to make me forget my friends&mdash;It is true, this mode of life has not a little engaged both my at|tention and my wonder&mdash;I wonder at every thing I &s;ee, and then I wonder that I &s;hould wonder at any thing&mdash;all here is one perpetual &s;cene of tu|mult, noi&s;e, and di&s;&s;ipation&mdash;mankind ever in pur&s;uit of &s;omething, which when found, creates more wants than it &s;upplies&mdash;a general &s;iege is laid again&s;t an old offender called Time, which, though every one complains of the lo&s;s of, yet every one is in league to kill it as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible&mdash;the old maid at Ranelagh may have hopes of making a conque&s;t, and the old ma|tron at a rout may be enraptured with &s;padille&mdash;but, believe me, the&s;e are
<PB N="11" REF="22">
only &s;econdary con&s;iderations&mdash;to kill &s;o much time is the principal point in view&mdash;for how can the old maid experience any real plea&s;ure from haunting tho&s;e circles where &s;he is con&s;cious that &s;he is con&s;idered but as the forlorn &s;hadow of her departed beauty&mdash;or how can the old matron receive any high gratification from returning to tho&s;e tables, where &s;he mu&s;t reflect (if &s;he has not &s;tifled re|flection) that &s;he can only afford new &s;pecimens of the acidity of her tem|per, and the fraudulency of her inten|tions&mdash;indeed &s;he has one con&s;olation, that the troops &s;he is engaged with are generally full as corrupt and con|taminated as her&s;elf.&mdash;You will &s;ay that the old can have but few pro&s;pects and amu&s;ements&mdash;it is true, but they
<PB N="12" REF="23">
can have real ones, pro&s;pects ever brightening, as attraction mu&s;t ever encrea&s;e, the nearer we approach the object&mdash;but you will now exclaim that I appear already to write from my dictatorial chair, and give laws in the true &s;tyle of a &s;chool-ma&s;ter; but I can never help expatiating on this &s;ub|ject, for it is not &s;o much the comet it&s;elf, as the tail of that comet that I am &s;o much in care for&mdash;there is al|ways &s;ome expecting niece or entru&s;t|ed cou&s;in, who, to be kept out of harm's way, mu&s;t be the watchful &s;entinel to all this &s;cene of di&s;order&mdash;good Heavens! as if the mind could be more in harm's way, or more di&s;|&s;ipated than by &s;itting &s;even hours at|tendant on a card-table, now and then admiring work, perhaps indulged by

introducing her knotting, and &s;toring her mind (for to read would be ill manners) with tho&s;e remarks only that avarice, ignorance, and ill hu|mour are continually &s;ugge&s;ting&mdash;and what are the fruits of this mi&s;erable farrago every day's experience too fa|tally evinces.&mdash;You think I wi&s;h to deter you from coming here&mdash;indeed I do,&mdash;for tho' the country, I fear, affords frequently no better examples, yet it is impo&s;&s;ible to drive quite &s;o fa&s;t on cro&s;s-roads, as it is on a turn-pike; and there are numbers who can keep them&s;elves afloat on a gentle &s;tream, who&s;e &s;trength is yet utterly in&s;uffi|cient to &s;tem a torrent.&mdash;I do not doubt either the goodne&s;s of your heart, or the firmne&s;s of your inten|tions, but remember the wi&s;e&s;t and

<P>I Now &s;it down to give you &s;ome ac|count of the pupil who is entru&s;ted to my care&mdash;He is a young man of rank and fortune, and not totally de|void
<PB N="17" REF="28">
of literary attainments&mdash;for a &s;hort time he has been at We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;chool, but (as too frequently is the ca&s;e) has been &s;o much taken off by the diver&s;ions of the town, that it was well if in the cour&s;e of the week the Ma&s;ters were able to remove that love of di&s;&s;ipation, which the young man had imbibed the preceding days of it&mdash;however, before I came to him he could tolerably con&s;true &s;ome of the ea&s;ier cla&s;&s;ics, and he is by no means deficient in point of natural abilities&mdash;by the death of his mother he is now committed to the care of an uncle, who, for a year and a half, has placed him under my direction&mdash;what my mediocrity &s;hall be able to impart I know not; but attention will not be wanting, and I have a father ever
<PB N="18" REF="29">
able and willing to &s;upply all my de|ficiencies&mdash;my pre&s;ent endeavour is to improve his ta&s;te by furni&s;hing his mind with the be&s;t critici&s;ms on an|cient literature, &s;uch as Warburton's on the 6th Book of Virgil, and Hurd's on the Art of Poetry.&mdash;By the aid of the&s;e books I perceive his mind to be wonderfully enlarged, and he has al|ready remarked that the fame of the commentators ought nearly to equal the glory of their re&s;pective authors&mdash;from hence you will gather that he has Feeling, which in preference to every other con&s;ideration ought prin|cipally to be improved.&mdash;He has ju&s;t a&s;ked my opinion of the Ramblers, which, &s;ays he, I find are generally con&s;idered as pompous and pedantic&mdash;I tell him that the Ramblers are my
<PB N="19" REF="30">

<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That they are the &s;tore-hou&s;e of all moral virtues."</Q>
&mdash;I fear he thinks I have &s;trong prejudices, for he often ob&s;erves that the world &s;peaks quite otherwi&s;e&mdash;as to the world, I tell him, there are but few who are capable of judging&mdash;tho&s;e that are, either through envy or other malignant pa&s;&s;ions, will rarely do ju&s;|tice to living authors&mdash;John&s;on would be more read, was his matter as thinly &s;pread as in other periodical publica|tions&mdash;then he has written on party &s;ubjects, and this can never be for|given by his vanqui&s;hed opponents&mdash;Warburton is not le&s;s obnoxious on the &s;ame account&mdash;indeed &s;o far I will

accede&mdash;that the one by long dealing in words has too much encrea&s;ed the vocabulary, and the other by dealing too much with mankind has at length exceeded the decent limits of all &s;ober &s;atire&mdash;but truth and virtue were their guides, and whil&s;t the&s;e remain in the world, &s;uch authors will ever be con&s;idered as their brighte&s;t orna|ments&mdash;an old gentleman was by chance pre&s;ent at this dialogue be|tween my pupil and me, who ha&s;tily exclaimed, "Good God! &s;ir, why I never heard a &s;yllable of all this, in regard to either of them, and I have re&s;ided the greate&s;t part of my life<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter lived at Prior Park, near Bath, and the author of the Ramblers in John&s;on's Court, Fleet-&s;treet.

<ITEM>It has been objected again&s;t &s;tudy|ing Thucydides, that he wrote a large folio compri&s;ing only a very &s;hort period&mdash;the time indeed is &s;hort, but the writer made ample amends by
<PB N="49" REF="60">
the force of his de&s;criptions, and the &s;ublimity of his &s;tyle&mdash;and it is a &s;uf|ficient encomium perhaps to &s;ay that he was &s;tudied by Demo&s;thenes, and imitated by Sallu&s;t.</ITEM>
<LABEL>VI.</LABEL>
<ITEM>Mr. Pope's E&s;&s;ay on Man is certain|ly a very ma&s;terly performance in point of poetry; but the philo&s;ophy contained in it is flim&s;y and uncon|nected.</ITEM>

had a very tolerable dance&mdash;next day we &s;aw lord Scar&s;dale's, which is very fine to be &s;ure; but Mi&s;s Ma&s;&s;em found great fault with the furniture of the hou&s;e, and Mr. Layout, who was with us, allowed no part of the garden ground to be di&s;po&s;ed in ta&s;te&mdash;Mr. Ma&s;&s;em admired nothing but the large pillars; and captain Glan|ville thought there was a great deal of idle money thrown away upon the library&mdash;as for my&s;elf, I liked every thing, but particularly the &s;ideboard&mdash;from Kedle&s;ton we went to Mat|lock, which, if it was not for the com|pany, would, if po&s;&s;ible, be ten times more di&s;mal than Marle&s;ton&mdash;how|ever, we danced and went upon the water with mu&s;ic, and drank tea at the boat hou&s;e, and, upon the whole,

pa&s;&s;ed our time very agreably&mdash;from thence we went to Chat&s;worth&mdash;it proved a mo&s;t charming day, and we were all enraptured with the water|works&mdash;in &s;ome places, cataracts of water fall down &s;tairs twenty yards deep, and in others the water is forced up into the air to the mo&s;t incredible height, to &s;ay nothing of the artificial tree which would have &s;prinkled us all over from its leaves, if it had not been out of order&mdash;from Chat&s;worth we went to Buxton, where we joined parties with lord Canva&s;s and Dr. and Mrs. Grudgens&mdash;at fir&s;t they took no notice of us, but as &s;oon as they found out who Mr. Ma&s;&s;em was, they were particularly complai&s;ant and ci|vil.&mdash;My lord is mo&s;t exceedingly engaging&mdash;but Dr Grudgens talks of

nothing but eating and preferment&mdash;and then &s;o &s;u&s;picious, that in a morning, when he played at <HI>all-fours</HI> with captain Glanville, if the hand was not out before the bell rung, he was &s;ure to keep the cards in his pock|et all the while he knelt down to &s;ay his prayers&mdash;indeed prayers here are merely made a farce of&mdash;for peo|ple laugh and whi&s;per the whole time&mdash;tho' it would not &s;ignify much if they did not, for what with the howl|ing of dogs, the bawling of footmen, and the giggling of ladies maids in the pa&s;&s;ages, it would be utterly im|po&s;&s;ible to hear one &s;yllable that the par&s;on &s;aid&mdash;poor man!&mdash;I was really quite &s;orry for him, and my father would have been ab&s;olutely &s;hocked, for the company had u&s;ed to pay him

<P>It would not be of much import|ance to enquire whether the gardens of Babylon were brought into u&s;e by Semiramis, Syrus, or Belus&mdash;we find in general, that they were terraces one above the other, carried up to the height of the wall of the city, and planted with &s;tately trees, in imi|tation of the hanging woods, which Amyite had been accu&s;tomed to in the mountainous parts of Media.</P>
<P>As the gardens of Solomon were chiefly calculated for magnificence, and tho&s;e of the He&s;perides celebrated for the excellence of their fruit only, I &s;hall venture to &s;uppo&s;e the dawn of ta&s;te to ri&s;e with the old Bard in his de&s;cription of Calyp&s;o's bower,

<P>It is not improbable, &s;ays Sir Wil|liam Temple, but that the mo&s;t refined plea&s;ures of invention de&s;cended ear|lier into Lower A&s;ia from Dama&s;cus and A&s;&s;yria&mdash;but as the&s;e nations abounded not with heroes, the poets make little or no mention of them.</P>
<P>It has been &s;uppo&s;ed, that Epicurus was the fir&s;t who introduced gardens into Greece&mdash;but Pliny a&s;&s;ures us, he was only the fir&s;t who had a garden within the city of Athens, whereas before his time they were without the walls, like the <HI>Horti Suburbani</HI> of the Romans.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="144">In &s;uch retreats this great philo&s;o|pher gave the mo&s;t &s;hining precepts of morality, however mi&s;repre&s;ented by the Stoics, or mi&s;taken by tho&s;e gro&s;s pretenders to his &s;ect, who con|ceived plea&s;ure to con&s;i&s;t only in &s;en&s;uality&mdash;they &s;erved the two pur|po&s;es of a&s;&s;embling the philo&s;opher's pupils for in&s;truction, and of furni&s;hing them, as Cowley well expre&s;&s;es it, <Q REND="inline">"with cheap and virtuous luxury."</Q></P>
<P>Nor was this luxury confined mere|ly to the philo&s;ophers&mdash;the greate&s;t warriours &s;ought for hours of reflec|tion in &s;uch retirements, and the &s;ame hands were employed in the &s;ervice of agriculture, which had rai&s;ed and &s;upported the glory of their country.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="145">Though utility was chiefly &s;ought for in the gardens of the philo&s;ophers, yet Virgil's De&s;cription of the Ely&s;ian Fields affords a mo&s;t beautiful &s;pecimen of bold imagery and rich de&s;ign.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"The full green of the woods&mdash;the gayly il|luminated lawn, the grove with the rapid river i&s;&s;uing from it; the du&s;ky thickets, the fre&s;h meads watered with rills, the &s;eque&s;tered vale rendered more &s;olemn by the thick wood, and placid &s;tream."</Q>&mdash;His account likewi&s;e of the old Corycians gardens makes us greatly lament, that ha&s;te &s;hould have deprived the world of his ma&s;ter|ly in&s;tructions on a &s;ubject he &s;o much admired&mdash;Father Harduin, indeed, in his Notes on Pliny, thinks the lo&s;s is amply made up to us by his brother Je&s;uit's Poem on Gardening, which
<PB N="131" REF="146">
he puts in competition with the Georgics&mdash;an opinion which will be adopted by &s;uch critics as feel no dif|ference between the feeble de&s;crip|tions of&mdash;and the glowing pictures of a <HI>Ma&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>In England we have ever, till of late, mo&s;t &s;ervilely copied our me|thods of gardening from the Italians, French, Flemi&s;h, or Dutch, all of whom indeed &s;eem to have offered nothing better in the con&s;truction of them, than <Q REND="inline">"clipt hedges, parterres, &s;quirting fountains, true-love knots, and flouri&s;hes."</Q>&mdash;Sir William Temple &s;eems much delighted with the ta&s;te brought in by king William, of which the evergreen quarter at Ken&s;ington remains a &s;pecimen; and offers Moore Park, in Hertford&s;hire, as the per|fecte&s;t
<PB N="132" REF="147">
figure of a garden he ever &s;aw&mdash;indeed he allows there may be other forms admitted wholly irre|gular, but they mu&s;t owe their beauty to &s;ome extraordinary di&s;po&s;itions of nature.</P>
<P>Lord Bacon does not like images cut out in juniper, or other garden|&s;tuff&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"they be for children," &s;ays he&mdash;"but can approve of little low hedges cut round like welts, with &s;ome pretty pyramids&mdash;and in &s;ome places fair columns upon frames of carpenter's work."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Pope &s;everely ridicules the in|va&s;ion of nature, but propo&s;es a place to be copied from, which in his time partook largely of the old ab&s;urdi|ties<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">A full detail of them may be found in Mon&s;r. de Phflaumeren, &amp;c</NOTE>; and who&s;e beauties were but

<P>Stowe, indeed, under its modern improvements, may be con&s;idered as a very fine &s;pecimen of ta&s;te and de|&s;ign, particularly by tho&s;e who are unacquainted with the exqui&s;ite ele|gance&mdash;I had almo&s;t &s;aid the ab&s;olute perfection of lord Scar&s;dale's.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It &s;eems to me, &s;ays lord Kamis, far from an exaggeration, that good profe&s;&s;ors are not more e&s;&s;ential to a college than a &s;pacious garden, which

ought to be tempered with &s;implicity, rejecting &s;umptuous and glaring or|naments&mdash;in this re&s;pect the univer|&s;ity of Oxford may be deemed a per|fect model."</Q>&mdash;That the gardens of Oxford may be as u&s;eful and effica|cious as tho&s;e of ancient Rome, for the purpo&s;es of &s;tudy and application, I will by no means pre&s;ume to deny&mdash;but they are certainly as artful as their buildings&mdash;they are formal with|out unity of de&s;ign, and complex without variety.</P>

&mdash;utility would &s;uffer if the ground was not poli&s;hed near the dwelling; but this poli&s;h, to &s;peak philo&s;ophically, &s;hould be, I think inver&s;ely as the di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke doubts <Q REND="inline">"whether beauty be at all an idea belonging to pro|portion"</Q>&mdash;&s;urely the effect produced by it in architecture &s;trikes even a common eye with plea&s;ure&mdash;the in|&s;tance produced from vegetables is not much to the purpo&s;e, for it will appear from an accurate &s;urvey, that there is more regularity in the parts of flowers than is commonly ima|gined&mdash;their forms indeed are infi|nitely varied, but in the &s;ame plant nature &s;eldom deviates from the laws of proportion, and &s;ome of our be&s;t botani&s;ts have actually founded much
<PB N="136" REF="151">
of their &s;y&s;tems upon the proportion of the parts&mdash;&s;o far therefore from &s;uppo&s;ing no beauty to re&s;ult from proportion, we may infer that &s;ome part at lea&s;t of the beauty even of vegetables ari&s;es from it.</P>
<P>It is &s;uppo&s;ed by modern rules that all avenues of cour&s;e mu&s;t be cut down, but I am far from thinking, that they may not frequently remain to great advantage&mdash;they mu&s;t be long and wide, and &s;hould properly lead to a Gothic ca&s;tle, tower, or any other large and ancient building.&mdash;I know it has been &s;aid,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vide E&s;&s;ay on Sublime and Beautiful.</NOTE> <Q REND="inline">"that ave|nues of a moderate length are far grander, and that a true arti&s;t &s;hould always put a generous deceit on the

<P>To remedy the ill effects of a &s;traight line, an uniform curve is now adopt|ed&mdash;but alteration is not always im|provement&mdash;and it reminds me of the conduct of the matron, who, to prevent her daughter from drop|ping her chin into her bo&s;om, threw it up into the air by the aid of a &s;teel collar&mdash;Hogarth's Analy&s;is has as yet been read to very little purpo&s;e.</P>

<P>THIS morning put a period to all my happine&s;s&mdash;your &s;i&s;ter&mdash;your lo&s;t unhappy &s;i&s;ter is fled with Glan|ville!&mdash;The care, the affection that I

have ever &s;hewn for her&mdash;all the prin|ciples of virtue and religion that I have ever endeavoured to inculcate, have availed her nothing, and &s;he is fled at la&s;t with Glanville.&mdash;From her infancy I have laboured to prove my|&s;elf a kind and indulgent father; and now when I meant to reap the har|ve&s;t of my toil&mdash;behold, this is my reward!&mdash;but I my&s;elf have been the cau&s;e&mdash;I have given up too far,&mdash;but as &s;he had lo&s;t her mother, and my notions of life were &s;uppo&s;ed to be too contracted, the opinions of others have weighed again&s;t me, and I have relaxed my own principles to her ruin.&mdash;I have got &s;o far on my road to town, but can hear no tidings which way they took&mdash;nor is it needful for me to inquire&mdash;I am rather flying

from my&s;elf than in pur&s;uit of her&mdash;&s;he is for ever lo&s;t&mdash;&s;he's ruined&mdash;&s;he fled, alas! with Glanville.&mdash;Had his intentions been honourable, whence this &s;ecrecy?&mdash;but nothing can excul|pate her&mdash;&s;he knew the depth of mi|&s;ery into which I &s;hould be plunged, and, had &s;he thought of marriage, would have &s;aved my de&s;peration.&mdash;Glanville would not marry her&mdash;he owns no ties of either hone&s;ty or ho|nour&mdash;he could violate all engage|ments (if he made any) and the infa|tuated world would call it Gallantry.&mdash;All her principles were polluted&mdash;&s;he was deaf to &s;hame, as well as virtue, who could dare to triumph thus over the weakne&s;s of a father's heart.&mdash;Delay not, my &s;on, to &s;eek&mdash;to inquire&mdash;to upbraid&mdash;it is too late, alas! to

<SALUTE>Dear Charles,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have now no hopes of &s;eeing you before I leave town, for I have at la&s;t got &s;ome faint intelligence of your &s;i&s;ter, and &s;hall &s;et off immediately for Dover&mdash;&s;hould &s;he have &s;et &s;ail (for I hear he is carrying her to France) I &s;hall then relinqui&s;h all pur&s;uit, and leave her to the protection of that power that can amend her heart, and a&s;&s;uage my &s;orrows&mdash;when you per|ceive me thus torn and di&s;tracted with my grief, harbour not a thought that your &s;i&s;ter was ever dearer to me than your&s;elf&mdash;&s;he is lo&s;t&mdash;and now awak|ens all my anxiety, <Q REND="inline">"but thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine."</Q></P>

<P>LET tho&s;e only talk of bearing up again&s;t afflictions, who have never felt them&mdash;there may be &s;uch &s;itua|tions that no principles can fortify the mind again&s;t, and under which the greate&s;t and the be&s;t mu&s;t ever fall&mdash;into &s;uch a one is your unhappy fa|ther plunged.&mdash;I pur&s;ued my journey &s;o much fa&s;ter than I expected, (for man neither knows his weakne&s;s nor his &s;trength) that I thought by night I &s;hould even reach Dover, but gain|ing no tidings, I began to &s;ink under my fatigue, and to hope only from time for that aid which philo&s;ophy could not afford me.&mdash;As I was pa&s;&s;|ing through a &s;mall village, I &s;aw all the people running out with unfeel|ing
