<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE remarkable u&s;efulne&s;s of Church Hi&s;tory, hath been formerly hinted. An acquaintance with that of our own, and of our neighbouring churches, mu&s;t certainly be peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;truct us concerning the <HI>many divine favours received,</HI> and the <HI>many &s;ins ungratefully committed</HI> in our land. In this abridge|ment, I have attempted to exhibit the principal &s;ub|&s;tance of many large volumes. In the Engli&s;h Hi&s;tory, my materials have been extracted from Fox, Fuller, Burnet, Strype, and &s;ometimes from Collier, but chiefly from Warner, Neal, Calamy, Bennet, and Pierce.&mdash; In the Scotch, Knox, Calderwood, Bailie, Brown, Shields, Burnet, Wodrow, Crook&s;hanks, De Foe, Ste|ven&s;on, Kirkton's MSS, Acts of Parliaments and A&s;|&s;emblies, and even Spot&s;wood and Guthrie, &amp;c. have been my conductors. I have aimed at <HI>impartiality</HI> in my narrations, but dare not pretend, that I have every where attained this rare hi&s;torical excellency. That I might not be tempted to impo&s;e my own inventions in|&s;tead of facts, I have &s;eldom dipt into the &s;ecret &s;prings of men's actions, or made reflections on them. Free|doms of this kind, too often render hi&s;tories little better than well written romances.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="4">To compleat my hi&s;torical plan, I once intended com|piling other two volumes of the <HI>Hi&s;tories of the Pro|te&s;tant churches</HI> of France, Switzerland, Holland, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Sweden, and Denmark, to which that of the Walden&s;es, herewith publi&s;hed, was to have been the Introduction. But want of acce&s;s to many nece&s;&s;ary vouchers, together with the increa&s;ing infirmities of old age, oblige me to drop this de&s;ign.&mdash; May &s;ome other, more adequate to the work, &s;peedily take it up. It is not, perhaps, to the clerical honour, that &s;o many of them labour in civil hi&s;tories, while that of the church of Chri&s;t is &s;o much neglected.</P>

Diocletian's per&s;ecution; Pelagius' errors; almo&s;t utter ruin of the church by the Scots and Picts, but e&s;pecially the Saxons; Popery introduced, and em|braced by all the &s;even Saxon kingdoms: Church and nation terribly unhinged by the Danes. P. 27, &mdash;34.</ITEM>
<ITEM>William the Norman conquers England, contends with Pope Gregory VII. about church matters. His &s;ons William and Henry contend with Popes, and An&s;elm of Canterbury. Henry II. is complimented with Ireland by the Pope, and, after terrible conten|tions with Popes and Becket of Canterbury, is oblig|ed to a &s;hameful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Some German heretics per&s;ecuted: Archbi&s;hop Richard's contentions.&mdash; Monks unruline&s;s. K. John, after much &s;truggling, re&s;igns his kingdom to the Pope, and receives it back as his deputy,&mdash;and by his barons is forced to grant <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> &amp;c. P. 35,&mdash;58.</ITEM>
<ITEM>K. Henry allows the Pope a <HI>tenth</HI> of all moveables. Italian clergy preferred to good benefices, but op|po&s;ed by the nobles. New Romi&s;h canons. Pope terribly oppre&s;&s;eth the Engli&s;h, but barons re&s;i&s;t his exactions. Grofthead, bi&s;hop of Lincoln, oppo&s;es both king and Pope. New exactions and canons; K.

<PB N="vi" REF="6">
of Otho and Ottobon late Papal legates. K. Edward labours to humble the clergy, and to free him&s;elf from part of his coronation oath. The Tem|plar knights are de&s;troyed. K. Edward III. by his &s;tatutes of <HI>provi&s;ors, premunire,</HI> &amp;c. re&s;trains the in|crea&s;e of Papal power. P. 59,&mdash;68.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Wickliff, by tran&s;lating the Bible and oppo&s;ing Popi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition, not a little enlightens the nati|on. He and his followers are per&s;ecuted. King Henry VI.'s barons oppo&s;e the Pope's demands.&mdash; Edward IV. befriends the clergy, who are directed what to preach. P. 68,&mdash;77.</ITEM>
<ITEM>K. Henry VIII. marries his &s;i&s;ter-in-law. Cardi|nal Wol&s;ey manages almo&s;t all affairs; is appointed by the Pope to vi&s;it and reform the mona&s;teries. Henry writes again&s;t Luther. Tindal's New Te&s;ta|ment hated. Provoked with the Pope for refu&s;ing to annul his marriage, Henry declares him&s;elf head of the Engli&s;h church. The monks furious adherence to the Pope provokes Henry to di&s;&s;olve their mona|&s;teries, and take the revenues into his own hand. By the influence of lord Cromwel, archbi&s;hop Cran|mer, and others, the Prote&s;tant Reformation was partially introduced; the reading of the Bible allowed. But in the end of Henry's reign, matters grew wor&s;e. Under Edward VI. Reformation was much advanced. But under Q. Mary, Popery was re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, and multitudes burnt for oppo&s;ing it. The per&s;ecuted had contentions in pri&s;on and at Franckfort. P. 77,&mdash;120.</ITEM>

hated, becau&s;e pious and mild. Whitgi&s;t, his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or, furiou&s;ly per&s;ecutes the Puritans, Cartwright and others: but Papi&s;ts were tenderly dealt with.&mdash; P. 120,&mdash;156.</ITEM>
<ITEM>K. James is courted by all parties; abu&s;es the Pu|ritans at the conference of Hampton court, but kind|ly u&s;eth the Papi&s;ts, notwith&s;tanding their gun|powder plot; pu&s;hes toward arbitrary power; orders a new tran&s;lation of the Bible; encourages &s;ports on the Lord's day; continues to per&s;ecute the Puritans; but, by the marriage of his &s;on and otherwi&s;e, encou|rages the Papi&s;ts. Character of him and his court clergy. P. 130,&mdash;172.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Charles and his favourites promote Arminiani&s;m and arbitrary power. Laud labours to promote Po|pi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition and tyranny; cruelly pro&s;ecutes Leighton, Prynne, and other oppo&s;ers. After &s;eve|ral di&s;&s;olutions, the parliament &s;tood their ground; promote reformation of religion; enter into a religi|ous covenant with the Scots; call an A&s;&s;embly at We&s;tmin&s;ter, which compiled a <HI>Directory of wor&s;hip, Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith,</HI> and <HI>Catechi&s;ms, Form of church government,</HI> notwith&s;tanding much oppo&s;ition from the Independents and Era&s;tians. After &s;ome years war with his Parliament, Charles was beheaded, notwith&s;tanding all that the Engli&s;h and Scotch Pre&s;|byterians could do to oppo&s;e it. P. 172,&mdash;232.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Under Cromwel there was little of a particular e|&s;tabli&s;hment of any Prote&s;tant party; but not a little of Chri&s;tian &s;obriety. He zealou&s;ly &s;upported Prote|&s;tants of Savoy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Monk having got Charles II. enthroned, Prelacy was re&s;tored; after &s;ome amu&s;e|ment with royal declarations and attempts toward a comprehen&s;ion, Pre&s;byterians and all other Prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters were terribly per&s;ecuted; but Papi&s;ts kind|ly protected. After Charles' death, K. James hav|ing flattered the Epi&s;copalians a little, laboured, by means of an univer&s;al toleration, to introduce Popery. Many Engli&s;h divines publi&s;h Tracts again&s;t it. By

<HEAD>A BRIEF SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF THE <HI>WALDENSES,</HI> From whom all the Prote&s;tant churches originated.</HEAD>
<P>WHETHER the inhabitants of the north parts of Italy, (or Italy proper) of which Milan was the capital, received the go&s;pel in the end of the fir&s;t, or the beginning of the &s;econd cen|tury of the Chri&s;tian aera, is uncertain. During the fir&s;t four centuries, their doctrine, wor&s;hip, di&s;ci|pline, and government, appear to have been much on the &s;ame footing with their neighbour churches, into which a de&s;ire of conformity with the heathens, and with the civil government, had gradually intro|duced a number of le&s;&s;er corruptions. But, from the writings of their bi&s;hops, Ambro&s;e of Milan,
<PB N="6" REF="10">
Phila&s;trius and Gaudentius of Bre&s;cia, in the 4th; and of Ruffinus, Chromatius, and Niceas of Aqui|leia, in the 5th; and of Laurentius of Milan, Enno|dius of Pavia, and others, in the 6th century, it appears, that they &s;till held all the fundamental doc|trines of the go&s;pel, which were afterward oppo&s;ed by the Papi&s;ts. They were &s;o far from depending on the Roman Pontiff, that, in the la&s;t half of the 6th, and fir&s;t half of the 7th century, they were in a &s;tate of formal &s;eparation from him, and &s;ometimes held him as an heretic. Nor in the writings of Maurus of Ravenna, Manfuetus of Milan, or the Liturgy a&s;cribed to Ambro&s;e in the 7th, and of Pau|linus of Aquileia, or of the le&s;s judicious Paulus Dioconus, and his collection of the Homilies of the Fathers, do we find the Popi&s;h doctrines relative to the &s;criptures, the merit of good works, mediation of &s;aints, or wor&s;hip of creatures, or their images, or tran&s;ub&s;tantiation of the &s;acramental elements e|&s;tabli&s;hed,&mdash;but the contrary. Nay, the council of Frankfort, in A. D. 794, made a noble &s;tand in op|po&s;ition to the wor&s;hip of images, and other increa&s;|ing errors, idolatries, and &s;uper&s;titions of the Romi&s;h church.</P>
<P>While the Chri&s;tian church, as Angilbertus of Milan mournfully laments, retained almo&s;t no re|mains of holine&s;s, &s;incerity, or purity, God, in the beginning of the 9th century, rai&s;ed up Claude, bi|&s;hop of Turin, with great learning and faithfulne&s;s, to defend and illu&s;trate the truth in oppo&s;ition to the prevailing errors and corruptions of the times, in his <HI>Commentaries</HI> on the books of Mo&s;es, Ruth, Goipel according to Matthew, and the Epi&s;tles of Paul to the Galatians and Ephe&s;ians, and his letters to The|odomir and others. He boldly maintained the equa|lity of the other apo&s;tles to Peter; and that men's works can, in no re&s;pect, merit the favour of God; that no traditions ought to be admitted as grounds or parts of religion; that men are &s;aved by faith in Chri&s;t alone; that all churches on earth are liable to
<PB N="7" REF="11">
error; that prayer for the dead is unprofitable; that God alone, and no creature, whether original or i|mage, ought to be wor&s;hipped; that the bread and wine in the Lord's &s;upper are not turned into the real body and blood of Chri&s;t, but are appointed re|pre&s;entations of them. The council of <HI>Paris</HI> in 825, as well as Agobardus archbi&s;hop of Lyons, ju&s;tified Claude in the mo&s;t of what he &s;aid, e&s;pecially in his oppo&s;ition to the wor&s;hip of images, and &s;uper&s;tition. In the <HI>tenth</HI> century, the doctrines of Claude were maintained by Ratherius of Verona, not without a mixture of mi&s;takes. Perhaps they were more faith|fully maintained by Gundulfus, and his numerous followers, in the <HI>eleventh</HI> century; but their tenets have been mi&s;erably mi&s;repre&s;ented by their Popi&s;h adver&s;aries, as well as them&s;elves were cruelly per&s;e|cuted.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all that the Popes could do, by force or flattery, the archbi&s;hop of Milan, and the whole of his large dioce&s;e in Italy, properly &s;o cal|led, continued independent of Rome, till about A. D. 1050; about which time, Nicolas II. by means of his agent Damian, having got a party to &s;ubmit, laboured to expel all the married clergy. The&s;e and others, highly offended with the per&s;ecution of Be|renger, who maintained much the &s;ame doctrine as Claude of Turin had done, &s;eparated them&s;elves from all church-fellow&s;hip with the Roman &s;ee and its ad|herents. Notwith&s;tanding the per&s;ecutions and ca|lumnies they &s;uffered, the&s;e opponents of the Romi&s;h corruptions exceedingly increa&s;ed, and &s;pread them|&s;elves into almo&s;t all Italy and France, Switzerland, and part of Germany. From their living in the <HI>val|leys</HI> of the Alps, the&s;e in Piedmont, Savoy, and places about, were called <HI>Vallen&s;es</HI> or <HI>Walden&s;es.</HI>&mdash; The&s;e in the &s;outh of France were called Albigen&s;es, or poor men of Lyons, from their re&s;idence in or a|bout <HI>Albi</HI> and <HI>Lyons.</HI> From &s;ome of their principal preachers, they were called <HI>Berengarians, Petrobru|&s;ians, Henricians, Arnoldi&s;ts, E&s;peroni&s;ts,</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;e|phi&s;ts;</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="12">
as in England, they were called <HI>Lollards.</HI>&mdash; Either from mere malice, or by confounding them with &s;ome that were really &s;uch, their adver&s;aries called them <HI>Manichees, Cathari,</HI> &amp;c. and charged them with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t errors, and the mo&s;t abomi|nable practices: but, from the concurrent te&s;timo|nies of the two Reyners, that executed the office of Inqui&s;itors again&s;t them, and of Freher, Baronius, Ralph-Cog&s;hall, Lien&s;tein, Thuanus, Claude-Sei&s;&s;el archbi&s;hop of Turin, Ribera, Paradin, the emperor Frederic II. and many other Papi&s;ts, it appears, that their lives were remarkably pure and holy, &s;o that nothing but their oppo&s;ition to the abominations of Rome could be ju&s;tly charged upon them. And from their antient manu&s;cripts placed by Moreland in the library of Cambridge, and others in the libra|ry of Geneva, particularly from their <HI>Noble le&s;&s;on, Explication of the Lord's prayer, Creed, and ten com|mandments, Catechi&s;m, Confe&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, &s;piritual Al|manack,</HI> and <HI>Sermons</HI> and tracts concerning <HI>Antichri&s;t, Purgatory,</HI> and <HI>Invocation of &s;aints,</HI> all dated about A. D. 1120; and from their <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of faith</HI> of that date, compared with tho&s;e of 1532, 1535, 1552, 1544, 1563, and 1655, publi&s;hed for their own vin|dication, in Italy, France, or Bohemia;&mdash;and from the accounts of Reyner, Pope Pius II. Claude-Sei&s;&s;el, Thuanus, and other Papi&s;ts, as well as of the Cen|turiators of Magdeburgh, it appears, that their doc|trine, wor&s;hip, di&s;cipline, and government, were all along very like to tho&s;e of the reformed churches of Geneva, France, Holland, Scotland, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>No doubt, &s;ome of them had particular opinions; but they generally maintained, That the word of God is the ONLY rule and &s;tandard of religion;&mdash; that the decrees of councils and dictates of fathers are to be admitted, only in &s;o far as they agree with it; that the reading and knowledge of the &s;cripture are equally free to the laity and clergy; that the &s;cripture it&s;elf is to be read, rather than the dictates of men; that bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper are the
<PB N="9" REF="13">
only &s;acraments of the New Te&s;tament church; that the euchari&s;t is to be received in both elements by the people as well as by the prie&s;ts; that the bread and wine u&s;ed in it, are but &s;igns and &s;ymbols of Chri&s;t's body and blood; that ma&s;&s;es are impious; to &s;ay them for the dead is downright madne&s;s; that Purgatory, or any other middle &s;tate of departed &s;ouls, is but an invention of men; that the invoca|tion of &s;aints is idolatrous; that the church of Rome is the apocalyptical whore of Babylon; that it is a true church which heareth the &s;incere word of Chri&s;t, and u&s;eth the &s;acraments in&s;tituted by him, be where it will; that the Romi&s;h Pope hath no lawful primacy over the church, or any title to both civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical power; that he and his bi&s;hops are the devouring plagues of the church; that prie&s;t's marriage is lawful, and vows of celibacy an invention of men, and occa&s;ion of &s;odomy; that monkery is but a &s;tinking carca&s;e of devotion, and its orders &s;o many marks of the Antichri&s;tian bea&s;t; that dedi|cations of churches, commemorations of the dead, prie&s;tly benedictions of bells, mitres, palls, palms, or other irrational creatures, together with forced fa&s;tings, &s;uper&s;titious fe&s;tivals, perpetual chanting of hymns, and the like, were invented by the devil; that none but God can forgive &s;in; and that auricu|lar confe&s;&s;ion of it to the prie&s;ts is unnece&s;&s;ary, and ought not to be admitted in&s;tead of public &s;atisfacti|on for &s;candals.</P>
<P>While their regard to the &s;cripture, and learning it by heart, and their uncommon holine&s;s, and in &s;ome things extreme &s;trictne&s;s of practice, &s;ufficient|ly di&s;tingui&s;hed them from the Papalins, and recom|mended their principles to all around them, they were &s;pread, with marvellous &s;ucce&s;s, by <HI>Bruis</HI> and <HI>Henry,</HI> through mo&s;t of the &s;outh of <HI>France,</HI> not|with&s;tanding all that <HI>Bernard</HI> and others could do to oppo&s;e them. About A. D. 1160, a rich merchant of Lyons, commonly called <HI>Peter Waldo,</HI> joined him|&s;elf to them, procured a tran&s;lation of the Bible into
<PB N="10" REF="14">
their vulgar language; and, having di&s;tributed his &s;tock among the poor, he, in 1180, commenced a public teacher, and had an amazing &s;ucce&s;s in pub|li&s;hing the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. Pope Lucius III. by a &s;entence of excommunication, con&s;igned him, and all his ob&s;tinate brethren, to the devil and his angels; and required all archbi&s;hops, bi&s;hops, princes, no|bles, and others, having authority, to hunt them out, and either force them back to the bo&s;om of the church, or el&s;e utterly de&s;troy them,&mdash;under pain of excommunication and confi&s;cation of goods to them|&s;elves, if they were not duly diligent. Not very long after, Ilde&s;on&s;us king of Arragon, and Frederic of Germany emitted edicts, bearing, That if any of their &s;ubjects &s;hould attend the &s;ermons of the&s;e he|retics, or afford them meat, drink, or lodging, their goods &s;hould be confi&s;cated, and them&s;elves puni&s;h|ed as guilty of high trea&s;on; and charging the&s;e he|retics to depart out of their dominions, within three days, after hearing of the&s;e edicts,&mdash;and encouraging all their &s;ubjects to plague, and di&s;tre&s;s, and de&s;pite|fully u&s;e them, if they did not.</P>
<P>The Walden&s;es &s;till increa&s;ed, and imperceptibly &s;pread through the mo&s;t of Europe,&mdash;Hungary, Bul|garia, Britain; and had numerous congregations in Italy, France, Germany, and Spain. It is &s;aid, they amounted to about eight or ten hundred thou&s;and. Finding their throne in danger of being &s;haken, by their means, the Pontiffs had recour&s;e to new and extraordinary methods of &s;ubduing the&s;e oppo&s;ers. In the &s;outh of France, where the earl of Tholou&s;e and other great men protected them, and where, it &s;eems, the clergy had been more humane or indolent, they almo&s;t filled both cities and country. Pope In|nocent II. therefore delegated Reyner a Ci&s;tertian monk, and Peter of Ca&s;tlenau to root out the&s;e he|retics. In A. D. 1206, Dominic and his compani|ons heartily joined them. By declamations and &s;o|phi&s;tical arguments, or by capital puni&s;hments where words were not effectual, they laboured, with no

&s;mall a&s;&s;iduity and zeal, and ho incon&s;iderable &s;uc|ce&s;s, in their converting work. Like mi&s;&s;ions and courts of inqui&s;ition were therefore e&s;tabli&s;hed by <HI>His Holine&s;s</HI> in every city of Europe, the inhabitants of which were &s;u&s;pected of here&s;y. At fir&s;t, the&s;e courts proceeded in much the &s;ame forms, as ordi|nary courts of ju&s;tice. But, encouraged by the in|human edicts of <HI>Frederic II.</HI> of <HI>Germany,</HI> and <HI>Lewis IX.</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> the <HI>Dominicans</HI> gradually formed their inqui&s;itorial judicatories into &s;uch engines of inju&s;tice, treachery, cruelty, and filthine&s;s, as might have made devils to abhor them, and blu&s;h. The years 1375, 1380, 1400, 1460, 1487, 1488, 1494, 1506, 1532, 1540, 1541, 1560, 1561, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> are repre&s;ented as mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed by their infernal work. But &s;ometimes, the&s;e bloody reformers were driven out, and murdered by the enraged populace.</P>
<P>Some of the Rules formed for the&s;e Inqui&s;itors, were, (1.) That they &s;hould never di&s;pute any point of religion before the people. (2.) That none who, in any re&s;pect, favoured any heretic, &s;hould be al|lowed &s;acramental ab&s;olution. (3.) That &s;uch as did not di&s;cover an heretic, &s;hould be cut off from the church, as a corrupt member. (4.) That an he|retic delivered over to the &s;ecular power, &s;hould ne|ver be allowed to vindicate him&s;elf before the peo|ple. (5.) That they &s;hould beware of favouring a|ny condemned per&s;on before the people, upon his retracting his here&s;y, and promi&s;ing to turn from it. (6.) The Inqui&s;itors &s;hould alway &s;uppo&s;e the facts charged as fully evident, and only examine the pan|nel on circum&s;tances relating to them. (7.) They ought alway to have a book open before them, in which they may pretend, the pannel's whole life, and a great many depo&s;itions again&s;t him, are recor|ded. (8.) They ought con&s;tantly to threaten him with inevitable death and damnation, if he do not ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;s every thing, and renounce his here&s;y. (9.) They ought never to attempt to con|vince him by the &s;criptures, le&s;t them&s;elves &s;hould
<PB N="12" REF="16">
be confounded by his an&s;wers. (10.) They ought never to an&s;wer directly to him, and ought to heap a variety of que&s;tions upon him at once, in order to confound him. (11.) If he &s;eem ready to prote&s;t, that he never embraced the here&s;y he is charged with, they ought to pretend, that they have &s;uffici|ent proofs of the contrary; and that if he confe&s;s freely, he may expect favour.</P>
<P>While the courts of inqui&s;ition thus laboured to hunt out, and de&s;troy the&s;e witne&s;&s;es of Chri&s;t, the Popes excited the civil powers to per&s;ecute them in every place;&mdash;in <HI>Terra Nova;</HI> in <HI>Calabria;</HI> in <HI>Pro|vence;</HI> in <HI>Dauphine,</HI> at <HI>Paris;</HI> in <HI>Bohemia</HI> and <HI>Au|&s;tria;</HI> in <HI>Germany;</HI> in <HI>England;</HI> in <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Holland;</HI> in <HI>Poland;</HI> in <HI>Italy;</HI> in <HI>Dalmatia;</HI> in <HI>Croalia;</HI> in <HI>Sclavonia;</HI> at <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> in <HI>Greece;</HI> in <HI>Livonia;</HI> in <HI>Sarmatia;</HI> in <HI>Bulgaria;</HI> and in <HI>Spain,</HI> as <HI>Perrin</HI> hath particularly recorded. But in <HI>France, Bohemia,</HI> and <HI>Piedmont,</HI> we find them mo&s;t cruelly murdered. In order to extirpate them from the &s;outh of <HI>France,</HI> where <HI>Remund</HI> earl of <HI>Tholou&s;e, Remund</HI> earl of <HI>Foix,</HI> the vi&s;count of <HI>Beziers,</HI> and others, protected them, Pope Innocent III. taking occa&s;ion from friar Peter's death in that country, ex|communicated <HI>Remund</HI> of <HI>Tholou&s;e,</HI> charging all arch|bi&s;hops and bi&s;hops to pronounce him accur&s;ed with &s;ound of bell, and extinction of candles, every Sab|bath and fe&s;tival, for murdering a good &s;ervant of God. He ab&s;olved all his &s;ubjects from their oaths of allegiance to him, and commanded all good catho|licks to pur&s;ue his per&s;on, and &s;eize on his property. He &s;ent preachers through all Europe, to promi&s;e paradi&s;e and all other privileges granted to tho&s;e that went to the Holy War in the Ea&s;t, to all &s;uch as &s;hould bear arms again&s;t the <HI>Albigen&s;es</HI> for the &s;pace of forty days. Some hundred thou&s;ands quickly marched to de&s;troy them, and &s;eize on their &s;poil. Terrified by their approaches, <HI>Remund</HI> not only clear|ed him&s;elf from the murder of friar <HI>Peter,</HI> but deli|vered
<PB N="13" REF="17">
up all his property to the Pope, and &s;ubmitted to a mo&s;t public whipping, naked, and to &s;wear to be obedient to the Pope all his life, and to make ir|reconcileable war again&s;t the <HI>Albigen&s;es,</HI> &amp;c. To avoid commanding the cro&s;&s;ed army again&s;t them, he went off to Rome, to reconcile him&s;elf with his Ho|line&s;s. <HI>Beziers</HI> was quickly be&s;ieged and taken; and about &s;ixty thou&s;and of its inhabitants murdered in cold blood. Nor could the &s;upplications of the Po|pi&s;h clergy and people, prevent their &s;haring in the common ruin. The military pilgrims immediately laid &s;iege to the town of Carca&s;&s;on, and having taken it, put all the inhabitants to the &s;word. They &s;oon after, with no incon&s;iderable lo&s;s, took the city of Carca&s;&s;on; but the inhabitants had &s;lipt off, through a &s;ubterraneous vault, and fled to Arragon, Catalo|nia, and Tholou&s;e. The earl of <HI>Beziers</HI> being per|fidiou&s;ly taken, died in pri&s;on, and his lands were given to Simon earl of Montfort, who was made ge|neral of the Pope's army. A&s;&s;i&s;ted by the king of <HI>Arragon,</HI> and by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who hated Montfort, the <HI>Albigen&s;es</HI> &s;till &s;tood their ground, notwith&s;tand|ing all the perfidious &s;tratagems of the Papi&s;ts to de|&s;troy them. The Pope's forces at length gave them a dreadful defeat, in which, and its i&s;&s;ue, they boa&s;t|ed, that they killed about two millions of them.&mdash; The council of <HI>Lateran,</HI> in A. D. 1212, having for|med &s;ome new re&s;olutions for the utter extirpation of the <HI>Albigen&s;es,</HI> another mighty army, of perhaps 300,000 cro&s;&s;ed &s;oldiers, was rai&s;ed under Simon of Montfort, by which, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Lewis VIII. and IX. kings of France, the Albigen&s;es, after a war of about 30 years, were almo&s;t utterly de&s;troy|ed, or driven from their country, and the earl of Tholou&s;e, and their other helpers, were reduced to the mo&s;t humiliating terms. Nor is it probable, that le&s;s than 500,000 of the Pontifical butchers pe|ri&s;hed in their murdering work.</P>

But the Lord, for a time, made the Bohemians under <HI>Zi&s;ca</HI> and <HI>Procopius,</HI> the terror of all the armies that could be rai&s;ed again&s;t them. The Papi&s;ts, never|thele&s;s, by throwing about 4000 of them into deep mines, and others of them into rivers, and other|wi&s;e de&s;troying them, did them all the mi&s;chief they could; and at length, by craftily dividing them, got multitudes of the poorer &s;ort cut off.&mdash;Notwith|&s;tanding the&s;e murders,&mdash;notwith&s;tanding imperial edicts, prohibiting the&s;e <HI>Bohemian brethren,</HI> that continued adhering to the truth, to remain in <HI>Bo|hemia</HI> or Moravia,&mdash;and notwith&s;tanding manifold per&s;ecutions, e&s;pecially of their mini&s;ters, they main|tained their ground, and had their Societies excee|dingly well regulated.&mdash;As, at the Reformation, they entered into a fraternal corre&s;pondence with the Lutherans, they &s;hared with them in their af|flictions. The Bohemian nation having refu&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t Charles V. in obliging the Germans to receive the decrees of the council of Trent, Ferdinand his brother impri&s;oned, fined, &s;courged, bani&s;hed, or murdered their principal men, and confi&s;cated their e&s;tates, and di&s;armed and di&s;enfranchi&s;ed the city of <HI>Prague,</HI> the capital of their country. He, by an e|dict,

bani&s;hed all the <HI>brethren,</HI> and ordered their churches to be &s;hut up. This did but &s;tir them up to re&s;olve to be &s;till more faithful for God, &mdash;and part of them to retire to Poland. In 1549, Ferdinand, by another edict, bani&s;hed about two hundred of their mini&s;ters, that were married, or had received their ordination in Germany.</P>
<P>Thereafter, till A. D. 1617, the Bohemians en|joyed not a little peace and liberty, under their Po|pi&s;h &s;overeigns. But Ferdinand having forced him|&s;elf into the throne, contrary to the fundamental con&s;titutions of their kingdom, re&s;olved rather to render his dominions de&s;olate, than to allow an he|retic to dwell in them, &s;et him&s;elf, by every po&s;&s;ible artifice, as well as bloody violence, to compleat the de&s;truction of their church;&mdash;in which he &s;ucceeded to his wi&s;h. Contrary to his coronation oath, he en|couraged the Popi&s;h clergy and nobility to vex his other &s;ubjects on account of their religion. Prote|&s;tants were prohibited to print any thing, but what was licen&s;ed by the Popi&s;h chancellor, while Papi&s;ts had full liberty to mi&s;repre&s;ent, reproach, and abu&s;e them. The Burgrave, who kept the crown, and privileges of the kingdom, was impri&s;oned, becau&s;e he had in&s;i&s;ted for a free election of the king. The Prote&s;tant churches began to be gradually de&s;troyed. In 1618, the &s;tates were prohibited to hold their u|&s;ual meetings for con&s;ultation. Their election of <HI>Frederic,</HI> elector <HI>Palatine,</HI> for their king, did but enrage Ferdinand, who was now cho&s;en to be em|peror; and rai&s;ing an army, by a bloody war, &s;oon reduced them to their wonted, or rather wor&s;e &s;ub|jection.

Their congregations were charged to a&s;&s;i&s;t in per&s;ecuting them, and threaten|ed with death, if they harboured or concealed them. About fifty of the principal Prote&s;tant noblemen were condemned and executed; and underwent their martyrdom in a mo&s;t Chri&s;tian manner. Whatever belonged to them or other Prote&s;tants, was confi&s;|cated, or given to the &s;oldiers, and other Papi&s;ts. &mdash;Ferdinand called for all the antient charters of the kingdom, and de&s;troyed them.&mdash;Prote&s;tant tutors for children were ab&s;olutely prohibited: all Prote&s;|tants were declared <HI>outlaws,</HI> and commanded to leave the kingdom, unle&s;s they re&s;olved to become catho|lics, within &s;ix months. Prote&s;tants children were ordered to be taken from them, and committed to monks or other Papi&s;ts for in&s;truction; and Prote&s;|tant wives were bani&s;hed from their hu&s;bands. Ma|ny of the antient laws &s;ecuring the liberties of the &s;ubjects, were repealed; and the free cities were impo|veri&s;hed by taxes and contributions cruelly extorted, and had &s;oldiers and other mean and ba&s;e men, e&s;peci|ally apo&s;tates, impo&s;ed upon them for their magi&s;trates. &mdash;It was enacted, That none but Papi&s;ts &s;hould be allowed any traffic or commerce,&mdash;or to learn any trade,&mdash;or to make a <HI>latter will,</HI>&mdash;or to continue in ho&s;pitals; and that who&s;oever &s;hould harbour a

Such as were weak and &s;imple were cajoled and flattered to embrace Po|pery. Such as attempted to leave the country were hindered. Fair promi&s;es of pity or favour were per|fidiou&s;ly made or broken. Marriage, bapti&s;m, and burial of Prote&s;tants were prohibited under &s;evere penalties. Such as remained in the country, were either forced to conform, or were barbarou&s;ly mur|dered; &s;o that, &s;ince 1625, there have &s;carce been any public appearances of a Prote&s;tant church in <HI>Bo|hemia.</HI></P>
<P>But no where were the Walden&s;es more frequent|ly, or more cruelly per&s;ecuted, or &s;hewed more &s;ted|fa&s;tne&s;s in the faith, than in their native valleys of Piedmont and places about. Such multitudes of them were apprehended in the 13th century, that the Popi&s;h archbi&s;hops of Arles and Narbonne re|pre&s;ented to their inqui&s;itorial per&s;ecutors, That the country could not afford materials for building pri|&s;ons to contain them. In 1440, their enemies &s;ud|denly fell upon tho&s;e of the valley of Pragela, and cruelly ma&s;&s;acred multitudes of them, in the depth of winter. Such as e&s;caped the hands of the&s;e but|chers, generally peri&s;hed by cold and hunger in the mountains. No le&s;s than fifty infants were found frozen to death,&mdash;&s;ome of them in the arms of their mothers who had &s;hared a like fete. Finding, that no cruelties exerci&s;ed upon particular per&s;ons or places, availed to their extirpation, Pope <HI>Innocent VIII.</HI> in 1487, publi&s;hed a mo&s;t furious edict again&s;t them, requiring the duke of Savoy, king of France, and all other princes, nobles, magi&s;trates, and others, to take arms again&s;t them, and de&s;troy them, where|ever they could be found; and requiring all preachers to &s;tir up and encourage their hearers to the utmo&s;t, by promi&s;es of indulgence, pardon of &s;in, and an im|mediate entrance to di&s;tingui&s;hed ble&s;&s;edne&s;s in hea|ven,

to root them out from the face of the earth; and threatening depo&s;ition to all civil and eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal rulers or officers, who &s;hould not with due dili|gence promote this bloody work.&mdash;Albert de Capi|taneis his legate inforced this bull with an exten&s;ive accu&s;ation of the Walden&s;es, and with proper direc|tions how to extirpate them. Animated by the&s;e things, the princes and magi&s;trates attacked them, in every place, and in every form, and murdered a|bove eight hundred thou&s;and of them,&mdash;in&s;omuch, that for a time the remains of them were &s;carcely vi|&s;ible. The duke of Savoy at la&s;t fearing that his do|minions would be depopulated by &s;uch a pernicious war, put an end to it in them.</P>
<P>It was not, however, long, when Margaret de Foix cruelly per&s;ecuted part of them that inhabited the marqui&s;ate of Salluces: but, animated by God, they drove out tho&s;e that had &s;eized their property, and enjoyed it peaceably for many years. Impor|tuned by the archbi&s;hop and the Inqui&s;itor of Turin, Charles duke of Savoy, in 1535, ordered part of his troops to &s;urprize and ma&s;&s;acre the Walden&s;es; but finding, that after they had recovered from their con&s;ternation, they, in their own defence, killed multitudes of their murderers, he was obliged to put an end to his open war, and take more &s;low methods to de&s;troy them, who had multiplied &s;o exceedingly of late, as to be reckoned more than eight hundred thou&s;and. Encouraged by Francis I. king of France, and by Pope Paul III. the Parliament of Turin, in 1536, renewed the per&s;ecution, and required the Walden&s;es to drive out all their <HI>barbs</HI> or mini&s;ters; and that all the re&s;t &s;hould, under pain of death, re|&s;olve, within three days, to go to Ma&s;s;&mdash;and in order to promote this, the mo&s;t eloquent Popi&s;h preachers were &s;ent to officiate among them; but they got almo&s;t none to attend their harangues.&mdash; Sundry of their <HI>barbs</HI> were condemned and burnt.&mdash; By order of the French court, or in&s;tigated by his own bloody di&s;po&s;ition, De Oppeda, in 1545, fell

upon the&s;e about Merindol and Cabrieres, and, in the mo&s;t cruel and barbarous manner, murdered a|bout 4000 of them, and burnt 22 boroughs and vil|lages. Philibert duke of Savoy, being re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in his dominions by the peace of 1559, the monks excited him to rai&s;e a new per&s;ecution again&s;t the Walden&s;es; but, by means of their repre&s;entation to him, and to his duche&s;s, the &s;i&s;ter of Henry of France, who really befriended them, a temporary &s;top was put to it. Neverthele&s;s, it was not long, when Philibert, pu&s;hed and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Pope, and by the kings of Spain and France, &s;ent a powerful army, under the Lord of Trinity, to exterminate them from the face of the earth. He, in 1560 and 1561, by every method, cruel or perfidious, did what he could to de&s;troy them, e&s;pecially their mini|&s;ters. But the repeated rebuffs his troops met with from handfuls of the&s;e people, together with the in|terce&s;&s;ions of Margaret his duche&s;s, made him grant them liberty of wor&s;hipping God in their own way, by a formal treaty June 5th, 1561.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, within about four years after, Phili|bert, perhaps in&s;tigated by Ca&s;trocaro, the bloody governor of the&s;e vallies, and e&s;pecially by the Pope, publi&s;hed an edict, requiring all his &s;ubjects, either to give their &s;olemn promi&s;e, before a magi&s;trate, within ten days, that they would go to Ma&s;s, or re|move out of his dominions within two months, and commanding magi&s;trates to tran&s;mit to him exact li&s;ts of all &s;uch as did not obey, that he might take pro|per mea&s;ures to puni&s;h them. But the mi&s;&s;ives of the Prote&s;tant princes of Germany, one of which from the Elector Palatine was exceedingly nervous and faithful, together with the interce&s;&s;ion of the duche&s;s, re&s;trained the full execution of it,&mdash;though Ca&s;trocaro exerci&s;ed all the cruelty he could upon them. Some of them being cruel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y pro&s;ecuted be|cau&s;e they or their friends had a&s;&s;i&s;ted the French Prote&s;tants, Charles IX. of France wrote a letter to their duke in their favour. In the end of that &s;ame

year 1571, they entered into a &s;olemn covenant to maintain their religion, and a&s;&s;i&s;t one another in their &s;tedfa&s;t adherence to it; which mightily encouraged them&s;elves, and not a little di&s;pirited their enemies. No &s;ooner had the duche&s;s died in 1574, than the bigotted Papi&s;ts &s;tirred up the duke to renew the per|&s;ecution again his Walden&s;es; but, by the interce&s;&s;i|on of &s;ome great men, the execution of it was in a great mea&s;ure prevented. His &s;on Charles, who &s;uc|ceeded him in 1580, had allowed them &s;ome re&s;t, had not their inveterate enemies, the monks and their &s;upporters, by an infinity of villanies, impo&s;ed on him, and thus been permitted to exerci&s;e their cruelties. Meanwhile, the Walden&s;es in the Mar|qui&s;ate of Salluces, which, from 1559 to 1588, had fallen under the power of France, were per&s;ecuted in much the &s;ame manner as their brethren under the dukes of Savoy. That country returning to the duke, their Popi&s;h adver&s;aries never re&s;ted, till, by their perfidies and per&s;ecutions, they had entirely ruined the followers of Chri&s;t in it, about 1633.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the Walden&s;es of Piedmont had, in 1603 and 1620, obtained a new confirmation of their liberties, every artifice was u&s;ed to ha&s;ten and compleat their de&s;truction. The monks and prie&s;ts loaded them with calumnies, artificially dre&s;&s;ed up, to render them dete&s;table. Apo&s;tates and others were encouraged or hired to commence proce&s;&s;es a|gain&s;t them, or to excite them to mutual law &s;uits. Their youth were tempted to lucrative marriages with Papi&s;ts. Such as fell under di&s;cipline were tempted to refu&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and to commence catholics. This, together with the general death of their pa&s;|tors, by the plague in 1630, and their receiving of French mini&s;ters in their &s;tead, occa&s;ioned a relaxa|tion of their di&s;cipline. All &s;orts of criminals were favoured, if they renounced their here&s;y. Apo&s;tates were enriched by fal&s;e contracts, and &s;uch as adhered to their religion, were obliged to pay taxes for them.
<PB N="21" REF="25">
Popi&s;h mi&s;&s;ionaries were appointed to labour among them as &s;pies and &s;educers. The mo&s;t wicked and infamous per&s;ons were encouraged, and largely brib|ed to bear witne&s;s again&s;t them. And if any, even Papi&s;ts, witne&s;&s;ed for them, and again&s;t their monk|i&s;h or je&s;uitical abu&s;ers, he was in danger of being excommunicated and puni&s;hed as a favourer of here|&s;y. To advi&s;e any from hearing the mi&s;&s;ionaries, ex|po&s;ed one to death and confi&s;cation of goods. To give the&s;e mi&s;&s;ionaries full opportunity of &s;educing &s;ouls or prying into &s;ecrets, they were appointed to collect the taxes. Per&s;ons in poverty or in &s;ickne&s;s were promi&s;ed large a&s;&s;i&s;tance, if they but engaged to go to Ma&s;s. All but Papi&s;ts were prohibited to have either public or private &s;chools, or to hold any kind of public office. Infants were forced from their parents to be trained up by Papi&s;ts. A council for extirpation of here&s;y was formed at Turin. For a trial, all the Walden&s;es of Campillon were comman|ded, under pain of death and confi&s;cation of goods, for ever to abandon their hou&s;es and whatever they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, within the &s;pace of 24 hours. New forms of per&s;ecution and torture were contrived. The Walden&s;es were continually cited to <HI>Turin,</HI> where they were ruined by the expences of the plea, or of their impri&s;onment. While Jews, heathens, and Mahometans were exempted by law, and no wi&s;e re|quired to conform, the Inqui&s;ition was authorized and encouraged to compel them to conform to the Romi&s;h religion, or to de&s;troy them; and they were joined with <HI>&s;orcerers</HI> in the laws made again&s;t them. Troops were lodged in their valleys, that they might be ready, in a moment, to cut their throats. To gratify their own re&s;entment, Popi&s;h rulers &s;ome|times murdered prie&s;ts, and then laid the blame on the Walden&s;es.</P>
<P>Having, by the&s;e means, prepared matters, Charles duke of Savoy, notwith&s;tanding his &s;olemn treaty with them in 1653 and 1654, and notwith&s;tand|ing their mo&s;t humble and earne&s;t &s;upplications to

him, and his mother, and their pretended attention thereto, by which their deputies were detained at Turin, did by the in&s;tigation of the <HI>council for extir|pating here&s;y,</HI> order his troops to march unexpectedly into the&s;e valleys, and murder his evangelical &s;ub|jects. The Marquis of Piarre&s;&s;e, and other com|manders of the troops, by flattery, and by perfidi|ous promi&s;es, amu&s;ed the poor people, to prevent their &s;tanding on their own defence, or e&s;caping to the mountains,&mdash;that they might have the barbarous plea&s;ure of cutting all their throats, or di&s;patching them in &s;till crueller forms. So dreadful was the cruelty and carnage made upon mini&s;ters, men, wo|men, and children, as had &s;carce ever been exem|plified on earth. Provoked herewith, Jahier, Gian|vel, and other brave Walden&s;es, took arms, and heading &s;mall handfuls of their brethren, defended them&s;elves, and often defeated their enemies, even when they were twentieth, or &s;ometimes an hundred times their number. This, together with the re|mon&s;trances of Oliver Cromwel, the States of Hol|land, and Prote&s;tant Cantons of Switzerland, oblig|ed the Duke and his council to put a &s;top to their infernal ma&s;&s;acre, which they laboured to excu&s;e and colour over with the mo&s;t abominable fal&s;hoods, and to confirm their liberties by a new treaty.&mdash;Cromwel not only effectually remon&s;trated for their relief, but procured them large collections in England, 12000 pounds &s;terling of which he depo&s;ited as a fund for the &s;upport of their mini&s;ters and &s;chools. But, by Charles re&s;toration, they were robbed of this pri|vilege.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the above mentioned Treaty of <HI>Pignerol,</HI> the Envoys from <HI>England, Holland, Swit|zerland,</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> who had come to interceed for the&s;e per&s;ecuted people, had &s;carcely gone home, when the court of <HI>Savoy</HI> and their agents had renew|ed their per&s;ecution, and continued it, notwith&s;tan|ding the humble remon&s;trances of the per&s;ecuted, and the interce&s;&s;ory mi&s;&s;ives from the elector of <HI>Bran|denburgh,</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="27">
and the &s;tates of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Switzerland.</HI> The poor people were obliged to attend at <HI>Turin,</HI> if they had dependent proce&s;&s;es. They were deprived of liberty to trade. Their deputies, who applied to their prince, were remitted to the Inqui&s;itors. The territory of <HI>St. John</HI> was deprived of all public exer|ci&s;e of their religion,&mdash;and, under the mo&s;t fal&s;e and frivolous pretences, almo&s;t every article of the late treaty was violated. Their managers of the public collections &s;ent them by their Prote&s;tant friends, were fal&s;ely charged with embezzling the money. Stra|tagems were formed for &s;ecuring the ignominious death, or a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of Mr. John Leger, their faithful and active moderator,&mdash;or &s;uperintendent of their churches. The duke and his court refu&s;ed to read any petition that re&s;pected their religion or trade. Bagnol, who had greatly recommended him&s;elf by his burnings and unheard of cruelties, in the late ma&s;&s;acre, was rewarded with the government of the valleys, and quickly began to impri&s;on or a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate their inhabitants. After he had decoyed &s;uch of them, as had fled, to return to their hou&s;es, he and the marquis of Flory fell upon them with their troops. But nece&s;&s;ity obliging the poor people to &s;tand in their own defence, they had marvellous &s;ucce&s;s a|gain&s;t their murderers, though &s;ometimes a hundred to one. This, as well as the interce&s;&s;ion of the Can|tons of Switzerland, induced the court of Savoy to think of renewing their treaty with them. But, while their deputies were at <HI>Turin,</HI> and contrary to the mo&s;t &s;olemn declarations of the court, their val|leys were at once &s;uddenly invaded by <HI>Bagnol</HI> and <HI>Damian,</HI> and about &s;ixteen or eighteen thou&s;and but|chering troops; but the poor people, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by God, and with the lo&s;s of no more than &s;ix, drove them out, with the lo&s;s of 600, if not 2000 of the &s;oldi|ers. They obtained a new treaty in 1664, but which was clogged with &s;everal injurious re&s;trictions, and with the payment of about an hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling to the duke and his partizans for pre|tended
<PB N="24" REF="28">
damages. As the fulfilment of this treaty, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, depended on <HI>Lewis XIV.</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> the Cantons of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> States of <HI>Holland,</HI> and court of <HI>Britain</HI> wrote to him in favour of the&s;e poor per&s;ecuted people, as well as they did and had done to the duke of <HI>Savoy.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e treaties and a&s;&s;urances, they were &s;till per&s;ecut|ed in manifold forms, till at la&s;t the court of Turin, encouraged by Lewis XIV's <HI>revocation of the edict of Nantz,</HI> and in&s;tigated by the Popi&s;h clergy, com|menced another furious per&s;ecution of them in 1686, which intirely ruined their churches, and obliged them to di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves along with the French Prote&s;tants into other countries. Thus the Wal|den&s;es, who had, under God, given birth to all the Prote&s;tant churches, were at la&s;t obliged to flee for refuge among&s;t them.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the&s;e manifold per&s;ecutions, it is hard to &s;ay, whether the Chri&s;tian patience and &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s of the Walden&s;es, or the infernal perfidies and cru|elties of their enemies were mo&s;t amazing. Multi|tudes of them were condemned and publicly burnt, as if they had been the mo&s;t infamous criminals. Multitudes of them, after &s;uffering all the cruelties, terrors and tortures of the Inqui&s;ition, &s;hared the &s;ame fate. After manifold oppre&s;&s;ions and impove|ri&s;hing exactions, multitudes were driven from their dwellings, and all their neighbours being prohibited to relieve them, peri&s;hed by cold and hunger. They were loaded with the vile&s;t reproaches, in order to make every body abhor them, and their very infants were repre&s;ented as ab&s;olute mon&s;ters in the form of their bodies. Sometimes they were obliged to put on boots full of boiling tallow, and required to walk in them. They had &s;oldiers quartered upon them, who, like devils, raged, bla&s;phemed, and tormented them, every way they could devi&s;e. Sometimes they were crammed into narrow rooms, where they had neither room to &s;tand, &s;it, or lie, that they might be &s;uffocated by their own breath or &s;tench.
<PB N="25" REF="29">
Multitudes were thrown from the tops of rocks, or into deep mines. Sometimes the men were a&s;&s;em|bled and &s;portfully hewed in pieces by the &s;oldiers, while the women were driven into hou&s;es and barba|rou&s;ly burnt. Multitudes were murdered in the &s;treets, and their naked carca&s;es for &s;everal days left unburied. Others were &s;tript naked while alive, and turned out amid&s;t fro&s;t and &s;now. Some were ca&s;t into dungeons full of &s;nakes, or like venomous tor|mentors. Some were thru&s;t into holes, full of iron &s;pikes, in which they could neither fit nor &s;tand up|right. Some were ca&s;t into pri&s;ons on the water, in which they could not &s;tretch them&s;elves; and if they turned them&s;elves, they mu&s;t fall into the water. Others were kept in pri&s;ons till they were &s;uffocat|ed, peri&s;hed with cold and hunger, or their bodies gradually rotted alive. Some had their mouths &s;lit up to their ears. Others had the fle&s;h cut off from their faces. Others were &s;la&s;hed in different parts of their bodies, or had their members cut off, one after another. Others were often put to the &s;trap|pado, and then hewn in pieces. Some had their brains da&s;hed out again&s;t the rocks. Others were nailed by the feet to trees, with their heads hanging downward. Others had their brains, brea&s;ts, or privy parts taken out&punc; or cut off, and broiled, or roa&s;ted, and eaten, or otherwi&s;e &s;hamefully or cru|elly u&s;ed. Others had their nails torn off by pin|cers, or had their other torments prolonged as much as po&s;&s;ible. Others were dragged furiou&s;ly through &s;treets or &s;tony places, at the tails of mules or hor|&s;es. Others were, in the mo&s;t barbarous manner, hung up on tenter hooks, or the like, by their &s;ecret parts. Others had their bodies &s;tabbed all over with forks. Some had burning matches put between their lips or fingers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or were roa&s;ted before, or upon &s;low fires. Such as had fled into caves were &s;hut up, &s;moked to death, or otherwi&s;e de&s;troyed. Af|ter being brutally ravi&s;hed, women had &s;takes run up through their belly, and were thus carried naked

on the &s;oldiers &s;houlders, or &s;et up by way &s;ides, or had their bellies ript up, or were cruelly burnt. If unborn infants dropt out, they were thrown into the fire, given to dogs, or trodden under foot. Other babes were da&s;hed again&s;t &s;tones, or precipitated from high rocks, or torn a&s;under, or cut in pieces quick by the &s;oldiers, in a way of diver&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>A COMPENDIOUS <HI>HISTORY</HI> OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<P>THE go&s;pel of Chri&s;t was preached in Britain not very long after his a&s;cen&s;ion to heaven: but whether by Paul, Jo&s;eph of Arimathea, or whom el&s;e, we know not. The &s;tory of Lucius the Briti&s;h king's reque&s;t of preaching mi&s;&s;ionaries from Eleu|therus bi&s;hop of Rome, is not in the lea&s;t probable. While Diocletian the Roman emperor and his col|league furiou&s;ly per&s;ecuted the Chri&s;tians on the continent, about A. D. 302, Con&s;tantius their Ce&s;ar in Britain, again&s;t his will, commanded to pull down the Chri&s;tian churches. But, as &s;oon as he had it in his power, he re&s;trained his per&s;ecution. It is &s;aid, that to try his courtiers, who profe&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves Chri&s;tians, he required them all to offer &s;acri|fice to the heathen idols, under pain of being depri||ved of their preferments,&mdash;and that &s;uch of them as &s;tedfa&s;tly adhered to their religion he commended and inrolled among his particular friends: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uch of them as complied with his &s;inful mandate, he &s;harp|ly rebuked as treacherous to their God, and di&s;mi&s;|&s;ed from his &s;ervice, as unworthy of tru&s;t. In A. D. 314, the bi&s;hops of York, London, and Britannia &s;ecunda, attended the council of Arles in France,
<PB N="28" REF="32">
which formed &s;everal canons, and tran&s;mitted them to the bi&s;hop of Rome for his con&s;ent to, and ob&s;er|vation of them. Whether any Briti&s;h bi&s;hops at|tended at the council of Nice in A. D. 325, I cannot determine. In 359, three Briti&s;h bi&s;hops, along with many others, at the council of Arimini in Italy, were, by the emperor Con&s;tantius' influence, forced to &s;ign an Arian creed. Perhaps after they came home, they, like their Gallic brethren, returned to their orthodoxy. But it is manife&s;t, that not long after, the Briti&s;h church was infected with the A|rian here&s;y.</P>
<P>About A. D. 400, Pelagius or Morgan, a famed Briti&s;h clergyman, taught, That Adam was created naturally mortal; that the hurtful con&s;equences of his fir&s;t &s;in affected only him&s;elf; that the law qua|lified men for heaven, and was founded on promi&s;es equally good with tho&s;e of the go&s;pel; that none can be the children of God, unle&s;s they be free from &s;in; that rich men cannot be qualified for the king|dom of God, unle&s;s they part with all their wealth to the Lord and to the poor; that man's free will, at|tended with proper information, is &s;ufficient for eve|ry moral action, without any &s;upernatural a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God's grace; that God's grace is given to men in proportion to their de&s;ert of it,&mdash;and that victory o|ver temptation is obtained merely by the freedom of men's own will. His errors being readily received and propagated by multitudes, the orthodox clergy brought over Lupus and Gsrmanicus, French bi&s;hops, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in oppo&s;ing their progre&s;s, and in foun|ding &s;eminaries of learning;&mdash;which perhaps occa|&s;ioned the long continued u&s;e of the Gallican liturgy in Britain. The mo&s;t noted &s;chools founded about this time were tho&s;e of Dubricius and Illutus, and of the mona&s;tery of Bangor.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h Chri&s;tians having gradually abandoned them&s;elves to wickedne&s;s, God gave them up into the hands of their northern and &s;avage neighbours, the Scuts and Picts, who terribly ravaged their coun|try.
<PB N="29" REF="33">
Their Roman &s;uperiors, being no longer able to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, they called in the Saxons, who ruled the north parts of Germany. The&s;e barbarous hea|thens had no &s;ooner repre&s;&s;ed the Scots and Picts, than they turned their arms again&s;t the Britons them|&s;elves, and murdered the mo&s;t of them. In con&s;e|quence of which, they, with the Chri&s;tian religion, were almo&s;t wholly confined to the principalities of Wales and Cornwal, where St. David and &s;ome other clergymen made a re&s;pectable figure.</P>
<P>Between A. D. 590 and 690, Augu&s;tin, the Ro|mi&s;h mi&s;&s;ionary, Paulin and Aidan, two Scotch prea|chers, Wilfrid bi&s;hop of York, and others, by their labours, converted the &s;even kingdoms, which the Saxons had erected in England, to what they called the <HI>Chri&s;tian faith.</HI> Augu&s;tin's principal aim was, to render them &s;ubject to the numerous ceremonies newly impo&s;ed by Pope Gregory the great. The Britons, and their Scotti&s;h neighbours, were excee|dingly aver&s;e to part with their Gallican or Grecian rites, in exchange for tho&s;e of Rome. Dinoth and his Briti&s;h brethren, as well as Aidan and Finan, Scotch Pre&s;byters, boldly with&s;tood the introduction of the Papal power or manner of wor&s;hip into Britain. Wilfrid was no le&s;s zealous for the Romi&s;h intere&s;t, and laboured to have the fe&s;tival of Ea&s;ter ob&s;erved on the day appointed at Rome, it was &s;aid, by Peter and Paul; and to introduce the form of clergymen's &s;having their heads, in form of a cro&s;s. After mo&s;t furious contentions, the Romi&s;h party, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by O&s;wy, Saxon king of Northumberland, gained their point. The &s;ame O&s;wy and Egbert king of Kent, appointed Wighard, the elected archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury, to repair to Rome for a pontifical con&s;ecra|tion. He dying at Rome, Pope Vitalian furni&s;hed the &s;ee with the famed and truly &s;en&s;ible Theodore of Tar&s;us, and &s;ent along with him Adrian a Neapo|litan monk, to prevent his introduction of any of his Grecian rites. Theodore having called a council of his Saxon clergy, got them per&s;uaded to unite in a
<PB N="30" REF="34">
&s;ubjection to the Roman Pope, and to receive a &s;et|tled form of church government. A&s;&s;i&s;ted by the princes, he drove Wilfrid of York and &s;everal other bi&s;hops from their &s;ees, becau&s;e they refu&s;ed to &s;ub|mit to his authority. Wilfrid appealed to the Pon|tiff, but the Romi&s;h decrees in his favour were di&s;|regarded in England. The conte&s;t for pre-eminence between the&s;e two haughty dioce&s;ans, continued till the end of the 7th century. Wilfrid led the way of the afterward frequent appealing from the deci&s;ions of Canterbury to tho&s;e of Rome. But many of the Saxon bi&s;hops little regarded his Holine&s;s' deci&s;ions. Others reckoning Rome the fountain of their Chri&s;ti|anity, treated them with more re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, In a king of the We&s;t Saxons, in a mixed a&s;&s;embly of laics and clergymen, formed his Code of 75 laws, requiring, That clergymen &s;hould live in a canonical manner; that every child &s;hould be baptized within thirty days after its birth; that none &s;hould tran&s;act worldly bu&s;ine&s;s on the Lord's day; that the tithes appointed for the clergy &s;hould be duly paid; that churches &s;hould be &s;anctuaries for malefactors, as the <HI>cities of refuge</HI> had been un|der the Old Te&s;tament; that murderers might make compen&s;ation for their crime, to the friends of the per&s;ons they had murdered.</P>
<P>After the haughty Wilfrid had, for about forty-&s;ix years, plagued the church with his zealous intro|duction of the Romi&s;h day of celebrating Ea&s;ter, and of their clerical ton&s;ure of the head; and with his mad promotion of monki&s;h &s;ocieties, and cau&s;ing of multitudes ru&s;h into them, contrary to every tie or call of affection or duty,&mdash;and of pilgrimages to the tombs of the apo&s;tles at Rome, and had &s;uffered not a little in the cau&s;e, he died A. D. 709. About the &s;ame time, the Engli&s;h church began to be divided into pari&s;hes. Many places of wor&s;hip had formerly been but chapels of ea&s;e, and were &s;upplied with preachers by turns from the neighbouring mona&s;te|ries, in which bands of clergymen, not in the be&s;t
<PB N="31" REF="35">
manner, lived together. Many of the Scots, Picts, and Iri&s;h were prevailed on to receive the Romi&s;h &s;ea&s;on of <HI>Ea&s;ter,</HI> and their form of clergymen's &s;hav|ing of their crowns. By the labours and example of venerable Bede; by the erection of &s;chools, and by the conte&s;ts between Theodore and the Scots, and, no doubt, by other cau&s;es, which we know not, learning prevailed more remarkably in Britain than in any other age before the Norman conque&s;t. Ad|helm, Ceolfred, Egbert, Bede, Eddius, Clemens, and Alcuin were their mo&s;t noted doctors. As yet the Engli&s;h knew nothing of Purgatory: they had little reverence for &s;acred reliques; and oppo&s;ed the wor|&s;hip of images. The Pope began to &s;end his legates for rectifying di&s;orders among them, and to demand <HI>Peter Pence</HI> for the erection and &s;upport of colleges at Rome. But they did not reckon them&s;elves his &s;ubjects, nor think his palls nece&s;&s;ary or effectual to con&s;ecrate an archbi&s;hop. Their kings divided bi|&s;hopricks at their plea&s;ure, without regard to his will.</P>
<P>The Dani&s;h inva&s;ions, together with the almo&s;t perpetual contentions between the Saxon kings, hav|ing long rendered the &s;tate of the Engli&s;h church and nation exceedingly deplorable, Egbert king of the We&s;t Saxons, who&s;e conque&s;ts laid the founda|tions of the &s;ub&s;equent monarchy, called a council at Calcuith, A. D. 816, which enacted, That the catholic faith and antient canons &s;hould be duly ob|&s;erved; that all churches &s;hould be con&s;ecrated with &s;prinkling of holy water as a kind of bapti&s;m, and with the admini&s;tration of the Euchari&s;t by the bi|&s;hop of the dioce&s;e; that an uniformity of principles and practice, together with the impartial exerci&s;e of church government and di&s;cipline be carefully main|tained; that none but per&s;ons of an unblemi&s;hed character, nominated by the bi&s;hop of the place, with the con&s;ent of the convent, &s;hould be admitted as abbots or abbe&s;&s;es; that it being uncertain from whom Scotchmen receive their orders, none of them &s;hould
<PB N="32" REF="36">
officiate as prie&s;ts in England; that all acts of preced|ing councils, marked with the &s;ign of the cro&s;s, in|&s;tead of the names of members, &s;hould be carefully ob&s;erved; that no religious hou&s;e &s;hould be alienat|ed to common u&s;es, without extreme nece&s;&s;ity, and the con&s;ent of the conventuals; and &s;ome of them, in no ca&s;e what&s;oever; that all bi&s;hops &s;hould have copies of the acts of council; that neither prie&s;ts nor bi&s;hops &s;hould exerci&s;e any power, but in their own &s;tations and di&s;tricts; that the funerals of bi&s;hops &s;hould be celebrated an&s;werable to the pre&s;cribed form; that the tenth part of their e&s;tate &s;hould, af|ter their death, be given to the poor, and their Engli&s;h &s;laves be &s;et at liberty, and, in fine, &s;o ma|ny p&s;alms be &s;ung, &s;ome ma&s;&s;es &s;aid, &s;o many pray|ers and oblations made for the benefit of their depar|ted &s;ouls.</P>
<P>After the Danes had almo&s;t ruined his kingdom, Alfred, the grand&s;on of Egbert, obtaining the &s;u|periority, forced them either to profe&s;s them&s;elves Chri&s;tians or depart the country. He, with great zeal, promoted religion and learning. He be&s;towed the half of his incomes upon the poor, and on mona|&s;teries, &s;tudents at the univer&s;ity of Oxford, which, it is &s;aid, he founded, and indigent foreign churches. By this means, he recovered his &s;ubjects from their deep ignorance. John Scot of Dun&s;e was his prin|cipal teacher. It is &s;aid, that he him&s;elf tran&s;lated the New Te&s;tament and P&s;alms into Saxon, for the u&s;e of his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>In the <HI>tenth</HI> century, the repeated ravage of the Danes again reduced England to the utmo&s;t confu&s;i|on and mi&s;ery. Religion, learning, and almo&s;t every thing amiable were neglected. In A. D. 928, we find a &s;ynod at Graetly, under king Athel&s;tan, the principal acts of which related to regular payment of tithes; provi&s;ions for the poor, and for parochial clergy; prohibition and puni&s;hment of breaking into churches, &s;orcery, witchcraft, theft, robbery, mer|chandize on Sabbath, perjury, man&s;laughter;&mdash;to|gether
<PB N="33" REF="37">
with directions for bi&s;hops to attend the courts of ju&s;tice, and over&s;ee and direct their procedure, and that of the &s;ubordinate clergy with re&s;pect to their religious mini&s;trations. About A. D. 942, O|do archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, e&s;tabli&s;hed other ten canons, a&s;&s;erting the &s;acred privileges of churches; the freedom of eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues from all civil taxation;&mdash;admoni&s;hing the king and his nobles to &s;hew them&s;elves exemplary in honouring clergymen, mini&s;tring ju&s;tice, and providing for the poor;&mdash;di|recting bi&s;hops, clergy, and monks, to promote re|ligion in their re&s;pective &s;tations;&mdash;prohibiting in|ce&s;tuous marriages, or violation of nuns;&mdash;exhorting Chri&s;tians in general to cultivate an unity becoming &s;uch as had one Lord, and held the &s;ame faith;&mdash; and to ob&s;erve &s;acred fe&s;tivals, pay tithes, and avoid &s;uper&s;tition. Dun&s;tan, having commenced primate of the Engli&s;h church, abandoned him&s;elf to cove|tou&s;ne&s;s, pride, and &s;edition, and was twice bani&s;h|ed for his crimes. He violently exerted him&s;elf to drive the &s;ecular canons from their mona&s;teries, and place his own monki&s;h brethren in their room. In|&s;tigated by his influence, Edgar, an ab&s;olute mon&s;ter of lewdne&s;s, rebelled again&s;t king Edwy, his brother, and obtained part of his kingdom, and afterward fell heir to the re&s;t. He, with all his might, a&s;&s;i&s;ted Dun&s;tan of Canterbury, O&s;wald of Worce&s;ter, and Ethelwald of Winche&s;ter, in extruding the canons, and in forcing the clergy to live unmarried. He and Dun&s;tan made two new &s;y&s;tems of <HI>Con&s;titutions,</HI> one of &s;ixty-five, and another of &s;ix, relating to the pay|ment of tithes, the behaviour of clergymen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Dun&s;tan, O&s;wald, and Adulf, by their holding a plurality of &s;ees, occa&s;ioned no &s;mall contention.&mdash; After Dun&s;tan had directed king Edgar and Edward his &s;on as he plea&s;ed, king Ethelred quite di&s;regard|ed him, as did almo&s;t all his &s;ubjects.

<P>In the <HI>eleventh</HI> century, Alfric archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury, in the <HI>homilies</HI> which he tran&s;lated, and in the letters which he wrote to his clergy, plainly af|firmed, That the bread and wine in the Lord's &s;up|per are but <HI>&s;igns and &s;eals</HI> of his body and blood that communicating at Ea&s;ter is no more profitable than at any other &s;ea&s;on; and that there ought to be no <HI>&s;olitary</HI> communicating of the prie&s;ts. He ur|ged his clergy to live unmarried, but did not pretend that marriage was unlawful; nor did he per&s;ecute &s;uch as were guilty of it. Elfeg his &s;ucce&s;&s;or is chief|ly famous for his heroic and Chri&s;tian manner of en|during horrid abu&s;e, impri&s;onment, and death from the Dani&s;h invaders, whom he had exhorted to u&s;e the conquered Engli&s;h with humanity.&mdash;To &s;atisfy the ju&s;tice of God for his own and his father's inju&s;|tice and murder of the Saxon royal family, Canute, now Dani&s;h monarch of England, &s;quandered away his revenues in rebuilding and endowing mona&s;teries. To quicken the langui&s;hing zeal of his &s;ubjects, he travelled in pilgrimage to Rome; and, it is &s;aid, procured &s;ome u&s;ele&s;s bulls in their favour.

<P><PB N="35" REF="39">William duke of Normandy, the conqueror, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h throne; and to fix his fami|ly on it, he laboured to fill the principal po&s;ts of both church and &s;tate with his Norman countrymen, and to introduce their language into the nation. The famed Pope Gregory VII. being bent to wre&s;t all inve&s;titures in bi&s;hopricks by the collation of <HI>Ring and Cro&s;ier,</HI> from the impure hands of magi&s;trates, he depo&s;ed one Engli&s;h bi&s;hop for receiving them from king William, and another for his illegitimate birth; but Lanfrank of Canterbury got them re&s;tor|ed. Palls from Rome now began to be thought ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the con&s;ecration of bi&s;hops. By the mo&s;t peremptory re&s;traint of clerical marriages and laical inve&s;titures, Gregory intended to render clergymen perfectly independent on civil rulers, and ab&s;olute <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">laves of the Roman &s;ee.

&s;ee. William con&s;ented to the fir&s;t; but com|manded Hubert to inform his Holine&s;s, That he held his crown of none but God and his &s;word; and he would never render it dependent on any other. Su&s;pecting that Lanfrank had encouraged William in his di&s;obedience, Gregory cited him to Rome: but, being fortified by the royal prohibition, he de|clined the journey. Being threatened by Gregory's legate, William commanded his &s;ubjects to acknow|ledge no Pope, but whom he allowed, and to receive no mandate from Rome without his leave. Finding William no le&s;s haughty and determined than him|&s;elf, Gregory laboured, by a mixture of flattery and threatening, to render him more pliable.&mdash; He a&s;&s;embled a council a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Rome, and required the We&s;tern bi&s;hops to attend it. But not one from England dur&s;t go up; nor did they &s;end their excu&s;e. William having formerly reduced the lands of abbots and bi&s;hops in Normandy to much the &s;ame taxes as tho&s;e of his other &s;ubjects, and ob|liged them&s;elves to per&s;onal &s;ervices, in attending his councils, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> he, to the no &s;mall offence of the Eng|li&s;h clergy, reduced their lands and per&s;ons to the &s;ame condition. Enraged with the news of this, Gregory commanded Lanfrank his mini&s;ter of &s;tate to repair to Rome, under pain of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion from his office of archbi&s;hop. Lanfrank &s;ent off a ju&s;tificati|on of his conduct; but was too wi&s;e to go thither him&s;elf. So much did William di&s;regard Gregory, one of the mo&s;t enterpri&s;ing Popes that ever &s;illed the Romi&s;h &s;ee, that all his &s;upplication and flatte|ry could not, for &s;ix years, procure the relea&s;e from pri&s;on of Odo, bi&s;hop of Bay-eaux in Normandy.&mdash; The ejection of the <HI>&s;ecular canons</HI> and <HI>clergy</HI> from the mona&s;teries, had formerly occa&s;ioned terrible com|motions. Now, the exemption of mona&s;teries from the bi&s;hops juri&s;diction, in which both William and Gregory had their own influence and ends, occa&s;ion|ed no &s;mall noi&s;e.

<PB N="37" REF="41">
abandoned by all his principal officers, that they might make their court to his &s;ons, died A. D. 1087.</P>
<P>By the intere&s;t and activity of Lanfrank, William Rufus his &s;econd &s;on &s;ucceeded him. He regarded the archbi&s;hop or other clergymen no longer than he needed their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He &s;eized the vacant bene|fices for him&s;elf; and for that end kept the &s;ee of Canterbury and others &s;everal years vacant. Falling dangerou&s;ly &s;ick, about four years after the death of Lanfrank, he profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a penitent, promi&s;ed to reform his practice, and, to atone for his former &s;ins, be&s;towed &s;ome lands upon the church. He fil|led the &s;ee of Canterbury with the famous An&s;elm a Norman abbot, and that of Lincoln with one Bloet his chancellor. Happening to recover, he heartily repented of his conduct, and re&s;olved to make the new bi&s;hops pay for their advancement. An&s;elm had too much of the haughty dignified clergyman, to comply with any thing contrary to his own incli|nation.&mdash;Highly offended with him, for refu&s;ing to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with money in his war with his brother, and for acknowledging Urban as Pope, before he had declared his mind on that point, William offer|ed to Urban to acknowledge his di&s;puted authority, providing he would &s;end him a pall for a new arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury. Urban's legate having fir&s;t got William to acknowledge his ma&s;ter's pontifical right, gave the pall to An&s;elm, who &s;tubbornly re|fu&s;ed to receive it from the hand of the king. Not long after, the Papal council of Clermont in France, prohibited all laical inve&s;titure of bi&s;hops or abbots. Having, on &s;everal occa&s;ions, in&s;ultingly de&s;ired his maje&s;ty's allowance to repair to Rome for the wel|fare of his &s;oul, and the good of the church, An&s;elm, contrary to his own &s;olemn oath, and to William's expre&s;s prohibition, &s;et off. William laid him un|der a &s;entence of bani&s;hment, and &s;eized on his reve|nues. At Rome, An&s;elm had his feet ki&s;&s;ed, and was revered almo&s;t on a level with Urban him&s;elf,
<PB N="38" REF="42">
while William was declared worthy of excommuni|cation. As An&s;elm had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in this, William di&s;regarded his mi&s;&s;ives; and with reluctance receiv|ed tho&s;e of the Pope.</P>
<P>William dying A. D. 1100, and Robert his elder brother being employed in the &s;acred, but truly Pa|pal and dete&s;table war with the Mahometans in Pa|le&s;tine, Henry, the younger, &s;eized on the Engli&s;h throne. To &s;ecure the favour of the Pope, he re|called An&s;elm to his former &s;tation. Returning more full of pride and bigotry than he had gone off, he, directed by the Romi&s;h council, refu&s;ed to pay any homage to Henry, and told him, that he would not &s;tay in England, if he &s;hould confer any clerical inve&s;titures, as he could hold no communion with ei|ther the giver or the receivers. Meanwhile, Pa&s;cal the Pope taking advantage of An&s;elm's embroilment with Henry, &s;ent over his legate to render the Can|terburian primacy more dependent on Rome. Hen|ry and his council wi&s;ely a&s;&s;i&s;ted An&s;elm in this mat|ter, and forced the legate to return, before he had avowed his commi&s;&s;ion. Prince Robert being on the point of invading the kingdom, Henry, to prevent An&s;elm's joining him, after no &s;mall &s;hifting, pro|mi&s;ed to part with the right of inve&s;ting bi&s;hops or abbots; but, having made peace with Robert, he re&s;olved to retain it. To put An&s;elm, who had, in his councils, &s;trenuou&s;ly contended for a ratification of the decrees of Gregory and Urban, out of the way, he &s;ent him to Rome, to beg from his Holine&s;s that right of inve&s;titures, either &s;imply or as a parti|cular favour; but &s;ent Warewal&s;t, elected bi&s;hop of Exeter, along with him, with &s;ecret in&s;tructions.&mdash; Pa&s;cal declared the right of inve&s;titures &s;acred and unalienable from the church. An&s;elm heartily ac|quie&s;ced; but Warewal&s;t boldly pled for his ma&s;ter, and at la&s;t told his Holine&s;s, that Henry would rather part with his crown than with his right; and find|ing Pa&s;cal no le&s;s determined in his mea&s;ures, he, in Henry's name, prohibited An&s;elm to return to Eng|land.
<PB N="39" REF="43">
Henry ju&s;tified Warewal&s;t's conduct, and &s;eized on the temporalities of An&s;elm's archbi&s;ho|prick. While the canons relative to inve&s;titures and clerical celibate, which An&s;elm had got enacted in his &s;ynod of We&s;tmin&s;ter, lay di&s;regarded in Eng|land, Warewal&s;t per&s;uaded Pa&s;cal to mark an indif|ference towards him at Rome. Provoked herewith, An&s;elm left Rome, and retired to Blois in France, where he told Henry's &s;i&s;ter, that he behoved to ex|communicate him. Henry having marched to Nor|mandy, to wre&s;t it from Robert his elder brother, patched up a peace with An&s;elm; and the Pope com|pleated it by appointing, That bi&s;hops and abbots, upon their election, &s;hould do homage to Henry; that An&s;elm &s;hould con&s;ecrate the&s;e bi&s;hops which Henry had already inve&s;ted, and Henry &s;hould re|nounce all right to inve&s;t any more. Both Henry and An&s;elm explained this agreement in their own favour, as much as they could. An&s;elm then ap|plied him&s;elf to erect the new bi&s;hoprick of Ely, and to per&s;ecute the married clergy, whom he owned to be the be&s;t and mo&s;t numerous; but death cut him &s;hort. Learning, pride, and mad zeal for clerical celibate and papal power, were the di&s;tingui&s;hing lines of his character.</P>
<P>Henry immediately re&s;umed his wonted powers, and inve&s;ted the new archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and only &s;ent to Rome for his pall. He afterward a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed him in hindering the Pope's legate to exerci&s;e his power in England. To revenge this in&s;ult of his au|thority, his Holine&s;s &s;upported Thur&s;tan archbi&s;hop of York, in refu&s;ing &s;ubjection to the Primate of Canterbury, Ob&s;erving that his &s;ubjects marked a regard for William his nephew in Normandy, Hen|ry became more tractable. Pope Honorius &s;ent John of Crema his legate, who per&s;uaded the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury to &s;ummon a council at We&s;tmin&s;ter. Henry having, in his perplexity, &s;urrendered his right of inve&s;titures, the whole Engli&s;h clergy became the &s;laves and dependents of the Pope. At the council,
<PB N="40" REF="44">
the legate &s;at on a kind of throne above the bi&s;hops and nobility. He declaimed with great warmth a|gain&s;t the abominable nature of clerical marriage, or mini&s;ters intimacy with their own wives; and that very night he was taken in bed with an harlot. The Canterburian primate repaired to Rome, and com|plained of the legantine mi&s;&s;ion, as an encroachment upon his authority. Romi&s;h flattery per&s;uaded him to return, inve&s;ted with legantine power over all Britain, and &s;o laid the foundation of compleat &s;la|very to Rome in that i&s;land. To manife&s;t his new powers, he called a Synod, and, in his Holine&s;s' name, ratified &s;everal of the canons made by An|&s;elm and John of Crema.</P>
<P>As Henry had robbed his elder brother of the crown, he was no &s;ooner dead, than Stephen his &s;i&s;|ter's &s;on, contrary to his thrice repeated oath of al|legiance to Maud his daughter, now empre&s;s of Ger|many, &s;eized on it. To confirm him&s;elf in his u&s;ur|pation, he &s;pared no promi&s;es to either clergy or laity. Cringing to the Pope, he admitted his legate, who not only held councils in his name, but cau&s;ed the monks of Canterbury elect their archbi&s;hop, without regarding Stephen's con&s;ent.&mdash;The bi&s;hop of Win|che&s;ter being made legate, not only called the pri|mate to his bar; but required Stephen him&s;elf to an|&s;wer for his impri&s;onment of &s;ome bi&s;hops, and &s;eiz|ing on their revenues.&mdash;While a mo&s;t bloody and barbarous war between the partizans of Maud the empre&s;s, and tho&s;e of Stephen, threw the nation in|to the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, Pope Innocent con&s;tituted Theobald archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors <HI>perpetual legates</HI> of the Roman &s;ee, that nothing might be tran&s;acted but under pretence of legantine power. Stephen's own brother, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, was inve&s;ted with &s;imilar authority. His ver&s;atile chan|ging of parties was extremely remarkable. At fir&s;t, he took part with Stephen his brother. Next he got the Empre&s;s elected and enthroned, and con&s;ign|ed all the friends of Stephen to the devil and his
<PB N="41" REF="45">
angels. And after all, a&s;&s;i&s;ted in re&s;toring Stephen to his throne. After much contention with his fel|low legate, Theobald of Canterbury repaired to the Papal Synod of Rheims. Stephen prohibited him to return, as he had gone off without his permi&s;&s;ion. To revenge this affront, Theobald, as well as the Pope, took part with the Empre&s;s, and returning to England, he laid that part of it which acknowledged Stephen's authority, under an <HI>Interdict</HI> of public wor&s;hip. The contending parties, wearied of the war, came to an accommodation; but Theobald, directed by his Holine&s;s, refu&s;ed to crown the &s;on of Stephen, who had, contrary to his oath, &s;eized on the crown.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the&s;e calamities, and to the infinite vexa|tion of the bi&s;hops, the monks, by their charters, and by exemptions purcha&s;ed at Rome, had gotten them&s;elves freed from their juri&s;diction, and quickly after obtained mitres and other badges of epi&s;copal dignity for their abbots. They &s;oon felt, that the Pope's immediate juri&s;diction was harder than that of their dioce&s;an bi&s;hops. By journies to Rome up|on the election of every new abbot, one of which co&s;t about 2000 pounds &s;terling,&mdash;and to obtain pontifical deci&s;ions of their frequent conte&s;ts, they were put to in&s;upportable expences. They were rendered &s;laves to the Pope and his legates; they were expo&s;ed to the hatred of their &s;overeigns, and involved in perpetual quarrels with the bi&s;hops; and even the pro&s;ecution for ju&s;tice at &s;uch a di&s;tant court, was a &s;evere puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Henry II. the Empre&s;s' &s;on, having obtained the throne, A. D. 1154, he applied him&s;elf to rectify the di&s;orders of his kingdom. The monks had not fini|&s;hed their &s;truggle for an independence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the bi|&s;hops. But Pope Adrian, who was an Engli&s;hman, diverted Henry from attending to it, by compli|menting him with the &s;avage kingdom of Ireland, providing he could conquer it. The Iri&s;h primates had all been married. The &s;on had &s;ucceeded the
<PB N="42" REF="46">
father for fifteen generations. None of their four Metropolitans had ever purcha&s;ed a pall from Rome. The&s;e things made Adrian reckon them mo&s;t bruti&s;h barbarians. Invited to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Dermod king of Lein&s;ter, who had drawn a war upon him&s;elf by his adulterous carrying off of the wife of his fellow king of Breffney, Henry &s;oon made a kind of con|que&s;t of Ireland. About the &s;ame time, he made Thomas Becket his chancellor, on the recommen|dation of Theobald of Canterbury, for whom Bec|ket's addre&s;s at Rome had procured the legantine power, in oppo&s;ition to his rival of Winche&s;ter. A|bout A. D. 1160, thirty per&s;ons of both &s;exes, e|&s;teemed heretics, landed in England from Germa|ny. Henry called a council at Oxford to examine their opinions. It is &s;aid they were all extremely &s;imple, except Gerard their chief. We know not what their real opinions were; but the council deli|vering them up to the &s;ecular power, Henry com|manded them to be branded with a hot iron in their forehead, and whipped out of Oxford; and prohi|bited all his &s;ubjects to give them any meat, drink, or lodging. Being the depth of winter, they peri&s;hed with hunger and cold; and it is &s;aid, underwent their &s;ufferings with great patience and cheerfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>Contrary to Theobald's advice, Henry re&s;olved to re&s;trict the clerical power. Expecting that Becket, whom he had loaded with favours, and who &s;eemed to be far removed from monki&s;h devotion, would a&s;&s;i&s;t him in it, he got him made archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury after Theobald's death. Becket &s;oon after attended Pope Alexander in the council of Tours, A. D. 1163, and &s;ecretly re&s;igned his archbi&s;hoprick into his hands, and received it back from him.&mdash; What remor&s;e he pretended for receiving it by Hen|ry's influence and the inve&s;titure from his hand, I know not. But it is probable, that he and the Pope planned their &s;cheme of rendering the Engli&s;h clergy perfectly independent on the &s;tate. Not long after his return, he delivered to Satan a nobleman, who
<PB N="43" REF="47">
had dared to oppo&s;e the entrance of one, whom he had pre&s;ented to the rectpry of Aynesford. Henry was highly offended, that one of his crown officers &s;hould have been thus excommunicated without his knowledge. About twenty years before, it had been decreed, that &s;uch as laid violent hands on any cler|gyman, &s;hould never be ab&s;olved by any but the Pope, and in his pre&s;ence. The clergy were now &s;trongly, but cunningly in&s;tigated to render them|&s;elves &s;ubjects to none, but the vicar of Chri&s;t. To honour An&s;elm for his zealous inva&s;ion of the royal power, Becket got him &s;olemnly canonized for a SAINT. This inflamed his clerical brethren to fol|low his &s;teps, in hopes of a like glorious reward.</P>
<P>The clergy having obtained the &s;ole juri&s;diction o|ver their own body, abandoned them&s;elves more and more to murders, and other horrid enormities. Of an hundred clerical murderers, not &s;o much as one was puni&s;hed with degradation from his office. Highly offended herewith, Henry commanded, That all &s;uch clergymen as &s;hould be apprehended in acts of felo|ny, murder, burning of hou&s;es, or the like, &s;hould be carried before the civil judges&punc; and puni&s;hed as o|thers: but Becket with&s;tood his orders with the ut|mo&s;t firmne&s;s and violence. The clerical boldne&s;s in wickedne&s;s &s;till more abounding, Henry having a&s;|&s;embled a council of his Lords &s;piritual and temporal, at We&s;tmin&s;ter, propo&s;ed to them five Con&s;titutions extracted from the cu&s;toms of Henry his grandfather, <HI>viz.</HI> That none &s;hould appeal to the Roman &s;ee, without the king's con&s;ent; that no bi&s;hop or arch|bi&s;hop &s;hould leave the kingdom without his maje|&s;ty's con&s;ent; that no crown officer or immediate va&s;&s;al of the king &s;hould be excommunicated with|out his knowledge; that clergymen charged with capital crimes &s;hould be judged in the king's courts; that repairing of churches, taking of tithes, and o|ther eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs of general concern &s;hall be judged in the civil courts: The&s;e articles were hear|tily approved by the nobles; but the bi&s;hops and
<PB N="44" REF="48">
abbots ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed their con&s;ent, unle&s;s this all enervating clau&s;e, <HI>&s;aving the rights of the clergy,</HI> &s;hould be added.

<P>Having got the&s;e articles unanimou&s;ly e&s;tabli&s;hed, Henry called another council of his Lords &s;piritual and temporal at Clarendon for extracting and con|firming the laws of his grandfather. Sixteen arti|cles were formed, bearing, That all differences rela|tive to the right of patronage &s;hould be tried in the civil courts; that no churches which are fees of the crown can be di&s;po&s;ed of in perpetual donation with|out the king's con&s;ent; that all clergymen charged with crimes again&s;t the laws, &s;hall appear before the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice, as well as before the eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal courts, and none of them after conviction be pro|tected by the church; that no clergymen &s;hall go out of the kingdom without his maje&s;ty's con&s;ent, and their giving proper &s;ecurity of their doing noth|ing to the prejudice of him or his &s;ubjects; that ac|cu&s;ations of laymen in eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, &s;hall be proved by reputable witne&s;&s;es, and whom the &s;heriffs &s;hall oblige to attend, if nece&s;&s;ary; that excommu|nicated per&s;ons &s;hall not be obliged to continue on the &s;pot where they lived formerly, but only to abide the judgment of the church; that none who imme|diately hold of the king, or any of his barons, &s;hall be excommunicated, or their e&s;tate laid under an In|terdict, without fir&s;t acquainting him or his Chief Ju&s;tice, if him&s;elf be out of the kingdom; that none &s;hall appeal from the archbi&s;hop's court, without his maje&s;ty's con&s;ent; that bi&s;hops and abbots mu&s;t per|form the &s;ervices annexed to their tenures, when re|quired by his ju&s;tices or mini&s;ters,&mdash;and mu&s;t be pre&s;ent at all trials, except when &s;entences of blood, or of lo&s;ing life or limb, are to be pronounced; that the revenues of all vacant bi&s;hopricks, abbies, or
<PB N="45" REF="49">
priories of a royal foundation, &s;hall be paid into the king's exchequer; that the king &s;hall have the power of conveening the electors of bi&s;hops, abbots, and priors, and the elected mu&s;t do homage to him be|fore their con&s;ecration; that he &s;hall puni&s;h every wrong done to the &s;uperior clergy, and they &s;hall pro&s;ecute &s;uch as injure him; that no goods of for|feited per&s;ons &s;hall be protected from his &s;eizure, in churches or church-yards; that all pleas of debt &s;hall be tried in civil courts; that the &s;ons of copy|holders are not to be ordained clergymen, without con&s;ent of the Lord of the manor in which they were born; <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The council unanimou&s;ly agreed to the&s;e con&s;titutions. But Becket refu&s;ed to &s;ign them with his epi&s;copal &s;eal, and not long after &s;u&s;pended him&s;elf from the exerci&s;e of his office, and impo&s;ed a penance on him&s;elf for &s;infully con&s;enting to them.</P>
<P>Henry dealt with Alexander III. who had been advanced to the Popedom by his influence, to ratify the above con&s;titutions, and to con&s;titute the arch|bi&s;hop of York his legate. Alexander, in&s;tead of this, laboured to reconcile him to Becket, and con|&s;tituted Henry him&s;elf his legate, providing he &s;hould not u&s;e his power again&s;t Becket. Henry rejected the office of pontifical dignity with great indignation, and re&s;olved to humble Becket. He cau&s;ed him to be pro&s;ecuted for holding a royal manor; for con|verting to his own u&s;e the revenues of the archbi|&s;hoprick of York, and of &s;ome other bi&s;hopricks; and for embezzling 30,000 pounds of the public money, when he was chancellor. Becket appealed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the Pope as his &s;ole judge, and refu&s;ed &s;o much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s to conver&s;e with Henry on their points of diffe|rence. Henry got him accu&s;ed as a fugitive from ju&s;tice, and di&s;obedient to his &s;overeign,&mdash;and after|wards of perjury and high trea&s;on. No per&s;ua&s;ions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f his fellow bi&s;hops could make Becket yield an hair <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">readth.

<PB N="46" REF="50">
his Holine&s;s to an&s;wer for his conduct. When the temporal Lords told him, that by refu&s;ing to &s;ubmit to their authority, he involved him&s;elf in trea&s;on, he boa&s;ted, that were it not for his charac|ter, he would, in a duel, vindicate him&s;elf again&s;t any one of them, who dur&s;t charge him with a crime. He fled to France, where king Lewis, in|&s;tead of bani&s;hing him, as Henry de&s;ired, protected him, and recommended his cau&s;e to the Roman court. Henry hoped, that Alexander would have gratefully befriended him, and at lea&s;t per&s;uaded Bec|ket to re&s;ign his &s;ee. But neither his former favours nor his pompous emba&s;&s;y had any &s;uch effect on the Pope. He and Becket declared ten of the con&s;titu|tions of Clarendon NULL and <HI>void,</HI> and threatened to excommunicate all &s;uch as &s;hould maintain them. Becket then re&s;igned his authority into the hands of the Pontiff. But Alexander, unwilling to have his faithful &s;ervant run down by the civil power, and fearing that his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion might i&s;&s;ue in the reducti|on of the Papal power, re&s;tored him to his office, and promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in it to his uttermo&s;t.</P>
<P>The conte&s;t between Henry and Becket became more and more &s;erious. Henry publi&s;hed a procla|mation, bani&s;hing all the relations of Becket; and commanding to &s;eize all the revenues of his &s;ee for public u&s;e; and prohibiting all corre&s;pondence with either him or pope Alexander; and declaring it high trea&s;on to bring any bull of excommunication or any Interdict from ANY of them; <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Becket excom|municated all &s;uch as adhered to the Con&s;titutions of Clarendon; and &s;ome of Henry's more active lords or mini&s;ters were mentioned by name. In a number of mi&s;&s;ives to Henry him&s;elf, he mingled threaten|ings with argument. He did all, that he could, to &s;educe clergymen and others from their allegiance. But tho&s;e of the province of Canterbury remained deaf to all his &s;olicitations. Su&s;pecting that Lewis of France fomented their differences, Henry levied an army to prevent an attack from France, or a re|volt
<PB N="47" REF="51">
of his own &s;ubjects. The clergy of the province of Canterbury dealt very plainly with his Holine&s;s, and repre&s;ented to him the ingratitude and irregula|rity of his conduct. Convinced by the influence of Henry's pre&s;ents, and by his own fears, that he might join the German emperor, another di&s;obedient &s;on, Alexander appointed his legates to repair to England, and there judge between him and Becket. Becket raved like a madman, as if Chri&s;tianity would have been ruined along with his lo&s;s of his cau&s;e. Nor could his friends per&s;uade him to re&s;ign his primacy on condition of Henry's giving up the <HI>Con&s;titutions of Clarendon.</HI> Thus matters proceeded, till about 1167, that Becket in&s;i&s;ted for a pontifical ratification of the excommunication which he had pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t the ob&s;ervers of the con&s;titutions of Clarendon; and for his Holine&s;s' allowance to con&s;ign Henry into the hands of the devil. Alexander informed Henry, that his allowance for his excommunication could not be long delayed, unle&s;s he &s;hould repent. Hi|therto neither Becket nor Alexander had profited much by their quarrel. The former had langui&s;hed in exile, and the latter had been deprived of his re|venues in England. But now, while Lewis of France invaded Henry's dominions in Normandy, Alexander manife&s;ted an uncommon regard to Becket, and con|firmed to him all the privileges he had formerly en|joyed. To revenge this, Henry entered into a league with the German emperor, who hated Alexander and if the nation could have borne it, he would have renounced Alexander's &s;piritual head&s;hip, and ack|nowledged Pa&s;cal his rival. Being informed, that the Engli&s;h were firmly attached to his intere&s;ts, A|lexander cau&s;ed the bi&s;hop of London to admoni&s;h Henry, and in his name require him to re&s;tore Bec|ket, and annul the <HI>con&s;titutions of Clarendon.</HI> The bi&s;hop having mildly executed his commi&s;&s;ion, re|pre&s;ented to his Holine&s;s, in Henry's name, That <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e inclined to continue his obedient &s;on, providing he behaved as a &s;piritual father; and that nothing hin|dered
<PB N="48" REF="52">
Becket's return, providing he de&s;i&s;ted from oppo&s;ing the royal prerogative and laws of the land, to which he had &s;worn &s;ubjection. Reckoning this mi&s;&s;ive injurious to his character, Becket con&s;igned the writer into the hands of the devil, and notified the &s;ame to his clerical brethren. Finding that this conte&s;t retarded his conque&s;t of Ireland, Henry be|came more and more anxious to have it made up. In an interview, which he had with Lewis, for e&s;ta|bli&s;hing peace between them, he per&s;uaded him, that it was only Becket's pride and ob&s;tinacy that prevent|ed a reconciliation with him. Both French and Eng|li&s;h nobility exclaimed again&s;t him, as intolerably perver&s;e, and unfit to be protected in either king|dom. Regardle&s;s of this, Becket delivered up the Engli&s;h bi&s;hops and other clergymen to Satan in &s;uch multitudes, that Henry had &s;carcely enow to officiate in his chapels. Enraged by this, Henry a&s;&s;ured his Holine&s;s, that unle&s;s he immediately &s;ent his legates to ab&s;olve his clergy, and decide the debate between him and Becket, he would &s;ecure the peace and ho|nour of his kingdom in a manner le&s;s agreeable to his wi&s;hes. Alarmed with this plain dealing, Alexan|der immediately di&s;patched his legates to England, with flattering letters to Henry, bearing, That they had full power to terminate the differences, and ab|&s;olve the excommunicated. But he privately a&s;&s;ur|ed Becket, that he would take care of his intere&s;ts; and advi&s;ed him to di&s;&s;emble for a little time. He gave the legates &s;ecret in&s;tructions, to give no deci&s;i|on, without fir&s;t acquainting the archbi&s;hop of Sens in France, who was a tru&s;ty friend of Becket, The legates therefore cavilled at every thing which Henry propo&s;ed. Ob&s;erving their conduct, Henry threa|tened to do him&s;elf ju&s;tice by another method. The replied, that they feared none of his threatenings, as they belonged to a court, which had been accu&s;to|med to command kings and emperors.</P>
<P>Not long after, Lewis procured another meeting between Henry and Becket, in order to have them
<PB REF="53">
reconciled. Henry offered to Becket a full re&s;tora|tion of all his dignities and privileges, and a thou&s;and marks to defray the expence of his voyage. Becket pretended that he had &s;uffered 30,000 marks of da||mage, all which he mu&s;t have refunded to him.&mdash; Finding no hope of his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, Henry &s;ent a me&s;|&s;enger to Pope Alexander, offering him as much mo|ney as would clear his exten&s;ive debts, and 10,000 marks more, providing that he would tran&s;late Bec|ket to &s;ome other &s;ee, and remove him from France to Rome. Alexander would do no more than &s;end other legates to mediate a peace between them. But as Becket refu&s;ed to promi&s;e any obedience to the king's laws, but what con&s;i&s;ted with the privileges of the Pope, and the liberty of the church, this at|tempt al&s;o proved fruitle&s;s.</P>
<P>Finding Henry extremely tenacious of his rights, the Roman court re&s;olved to humble him by force, as they had ju&s;t done Frederic, the German empe|ror. To prepare their way, they every where repre|&s;ented him and his laws as extremely dete&s;table, and extolled Becket as an almo&s;t unparalleled &s;aint and confe&s;&s;or. Three legates were then appointed to ex|communicate Henry, and lay his kingdom under an Interdict. Informed of their intentions, Henry re|nounced the authority of both Pope and archbi&s;hop, and prohibited all his Engli&s;h &s;ubjects to receive any of their mandates. He ordained, That no Peter|pence &s;hould be paid without his warrant; that all the clergy that were out of the kingdom &s;hould im|mediately return, under pain of forfeiting all their revenues; that none &s;hould &s;ubmit to any letter of Interdict, under pain of being hanged on the &s;pot as traitors to their king and country. To e&s;tabli&s;h his family on the throne, he, in a crowded a&s;&s;embly of his principal &s;ubjects, cau&s;ed Henry his elde&s;t &s;on to be crowned by the archbi&s;hop of York, and to &s;wear that he would inviolably ob&s;erve the antient cu&s;toms. Becket loudly complained of injury done him,&mdash;pre|tending, that the coronation indi&s;pen&s;ibly belonged
<PB REF="54">
to the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. Alexander quick|ly con&s;igned over the archbi&s;hop of York, and all other bi&s;hops, who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the coronation, to the devil and his angels, and threatened to do the &s;ame with Henry him&s;elf, if he did not, without de|lay, make peace with Becket, who at the &s;ame time notified, that he would lay the kingdom under an Interdict of all public wor&s;hip, if he was not recon|ciled within fifteen days. Afraid of a fate like to that of the German emperor, or of trouble to his young &s;on, or perhaps of Papal damnation to his &s;oul, in the future &s;tate, Henry, newly recovered from a violent fever, had two meetings with Becket in the pre&s;ence of king Lewis, in the la&s;t of which he yield|ed all that Becket demanded. However heartily Henry had forgiven the injuries done him, Becket, now rendered more proud than ever, pro&s;ecuted his re&s;entments. He alway went attended by an armed guard; and in this manner attempted to enter the palace of the young king. He pro&s;ecuted the Pope's excommunication of his fellow bi&s;hops. They fled from England to Henry in Normandy, and repre|&s;ented Becket as a public incendiary, a per&s;ecutor of clergymen, and a determined enemy of his king, and a de&s;troyer of all good men that came in his way. Henry, in his outragious pa&s;&s;ion, &s;aid, that it was &s;trange, that not one of his numerous dependents had courage to avenge him of a &s;ingle prie&s;t, who braved and &s;ought to depo&s;e and di&s;inherit him.&mdash; Four gentlemen of his hou&s;hold, moved by this &s;u|rious expre&s;&s;ion, ha&s;ted to England, and murdered Becket, while he was officiating in his cathedral.</P>
<P>The Romi&s;h court no &s;ooner heard of it, than they re&s;olved to revenge his death in the mo&s;t terrible manner. The French king, the bi&s;hop of Sens, and others, charged Henry with it; and care was taken to proclaim it in the mo&s;t horrid forms through all Chri&s;tendom. Henry was threatened with excom|munication, and his kingdom with an Interdict, un|le&s;s he &s;hould &s;peedily give &s;ufficient evidence of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="51" REF="55">
repentance. He di&s;patched his amba&s;&s;adors to the &s;everal foreign courts to di&s;own the fact, and to de|clare his dete&s;tation of it. The&s;e &s;ent to Rome were at fir&s;t rudely maltreated, and had audience denied them: but a pre&s;ent of five hundred marks &s;terling opened their way to his Holine&s;s' ear. Their promi&s;e that Henry would &s;ubmit to the judgment of the church, prevented his con&s;ignation to Satan, and the interdiction of public wor&s;hip in his kingdom. Legates were di&s;patched to England to ab&s;olve him. They collected all the depo&s;itions they could to prove him guilty; but finding none to their purpo&s;e, they allowed him at la&s;t to clear him&s;elf hy oath, that he had neither commanded nor a&s;&s;ented to the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nation. They then accommodated matters with him, on condition that he &s;hould never withdraw his &s;ubjection from Pope Alexander and his &s;ucce&s;|&s;ors, while they acknowledged him a catholic &s;ove|eign; that in all eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es he &s;hould allow appeals to Rome; that he &s;hould &s;erve three years <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the &s;acred war again&s;t the Infidels in Pale&s;tine, un|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s di&s;pen&s;ed with by the Pope, and &s;hould maintain two hundred men for that &s;ervice; that he &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ully pardon all the adherents of Becket, and re&s;tore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;ee of Canterbury every thing that had been ta|ken from it during his exile; and that he &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nnul all laws and cu&s;toms which he had introduced to the hurt of the church; &mdash;to which was added this &s;ecret article, That he &s;hould go barefooted to Becket's tomb, and a&s;k pardon, and endure a &s;ound whipping from all the Canterburian monks. Upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he&s;e conditions, Henry obtained pardon of a crime of which they had fir&s;t cau&s;ed him &s;wear him&s;elf inno|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent, when they could find no proof of it.

<P><PB N="52" REF="56">The monks of Canterbury appeared to inherit his ambitious and ob&s;tinate temper. They claimed the &s;ole power of electing his &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and carried their point again&s;t both their kings. Richard, whom they elected, was &s;carcely con&s;ecrated, when, in his council at We&s;tmin&s;ter, he got eighteen <HI>canons</HI> enac|ted, importing, That no clergymen &s;hould marry; that no &s;ons &s;hould &s;ucceed their fathers in &s;piritual functions; that no clergymen &s;hould frequent public hou&s;es, unle&s;s when on journeys; that none of them &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t in the judgment of capital crimes; and that no money &s;hould be taken for the <HI>holy chri&s;m,</HI> or <HI>bapti&s;m,</HI> or any other &s;acrament. Richard's next work was a furious di&s;pute concerning juri&s;diction with Roger of York, which i&s;&s;ued in mutual blows. Meanwhile, the Pope's legate per&s;uaded Henry to exempt clergymen from all civil judgment, except with re&s;pect to &s;ome &s;ervices, and the abu&s;e of fore&s;ts. In con&s;equence of this, they became the ab&s;olute &s;laves of the Pope, and almo&s;t perpetually conte&s;ted with the laity, in order to in&s;lave the whole king|dom.</P>
<P>Alexander called a council at Rome, A. D. 1179, and required the We&s;tern bi&s;hops to attend it. Four Engli&s;h bi&s;hops repaired to it. But Richard, mind|ful of &s;ome offence which his Holine&s;s had given him, in taking part with his opponent prior of the monks, went not. They prohibited the &s;ecular powers to judge any clergyman, under pain of excommunicati|on,&mdash;or to impo&s;e any tax upon them, unle&s;s they generou&s;ly offered their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and the laity were incapable to bear the nece&s;&s;ary burdens. They required all Chri&s;tian princes to eztirpate heretics,&mdash;to prevent their living under their juri&s;diction,&mdash;and to confi&s;|cate their goods, and render their per&s;ons &s;laves. They decreed the &s;ame privileges as to the &s;acred warriors in Pale&s;tine, to all &s;uch as &s;hould take arms again&s;t them.&mdash;The&s;e laws were reckoned the more nece&s;&s;ary, as the Walden&s;es had exceedingly increa&s;|ed, and &s;pread them&s;elves in &s;everal places of Eurupe.
<PB N="53" REF="57">
The monks of Malm&s;bury withdrawment of them|&s;elves from under their bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury, and their forging of a charter for defending their di&s;obedience, drew from archbi&s;hop Richard a &s;en&s;ible Remon|&s;trance to the Pope. Much about the &s;ame time, in a letter to one of his &s;uffragans, he laments, That the Engli&s;h clergy had wickedly &s;ubjected them&s;elves to the Pope in&s;tead of their lawful &s;overeign, in con|&s;equence of which, one might murder as many cler|gymen as he plea&s;ed; and then, by pro&s;titution of an amiable wife, or by a little money, purcha&s;e his ab&s;olution from a prie&s;t.</P>
<P>While Lucius, the Papal &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Alexander, was bu&s;y demanding a&s;&s;i&s;tance from England, to de|pre&s;s the &s;enate and people at Rome, the monks of Canterbury, by king Richard's intreaties, and other like methods, elected Baldwin their archbi&s;hop. He attempted to erect a college for the <HI>&s;ecular canons</HI> at his &s;ee: but his Holine&s;s, in&s;tigated by the monks, cau&s;ed him to demoli&s;h it, and hallow the ground. At la&s;t, the mob, in&s;tigated by the monks, pulled down the buildings, and the archbi&s;hop, with the materials, laid the foundation of the palace of Lam|beth, which the Pope al&s;o ordered to be demoli&s;hed. Meanwhile, great preparations were made for a mad warlike expedition to Pale&s;tine.</P>
<P>K. Richard I. dying, his brother John &s;ucceeded him A. D. 1199. Contrary to his inclination, the monks of St. David elected one Girald for their bi|&s;hop. He po&s;ted to Rome for confirmation; and by his large offers thought to have been created an archbi&s;hop of Wales. But king John and the arch|bi&s;hop defeated his project; and another was made bi&s;hop. Much about the &s;ame time, Pope Innocent III. finding the We&s;tern churches &s;ufficiently entan|gled in his yoke, appointed a general valuation of their revenues, and the fortieth part of them, to be granted for carrying on the &s;acred war. The archbi&s;hop of York prohibited the lifting of this tax in his dioce&s;e, excommunicated the officers that le|vied
<PB N="54" REF="58">
it, and laid the country under an Interdict, be|cau&s;e they would not oppo&s;e them; but he was o|bliged to yield. The monks having &s;eized upon the rector&s;hip of Fever&s;ham, before the king's pre&s;entee had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, Innocent took their part. Several who had inli&s;ted them&s;elves for the <HI>&s;acred war</HI> drawing back, Innocent appointed the bi&s;hops to excommunicate them by name, every Sabbath, and obliged king John, notwith&s;tanding his deep po|verty, to give the 40th part of his revenues for car|rying on that mad war.</P>
<P>Hubert, the excellent archbi&s;hop of Canterbury dying, the monks of that place cho&s;e Reginald, their &s;ubprior, to &s;uccced him. He immediately po&s;ted to Rome for confirmation; and notwith&s;tanding that he had given his &s;olemn oath to his electors, that he Would not reveal his election till they &s;hould allow him, he no &s;ooner got over the channel, than he every where a&s;&s;umed the dignity of archbi&s;hop in his way to Rome. Provoked with his impiety and im|prudence, or fearing the king's di&s;plea&s;ure, the pre|valent party of monks in the convent, begged his maje&s;ty's leave to choo&s;e a new archbi&s;hop. Appea&s;|ed by their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, John recommended Gray bi&s;hop of Norwich to their choice; and at his own expence po&s;ted off a number of the monks to obtain his confirmation at Rome, while the bi&s;hops di&s;|patched their proxies to complain, that they had been deprived of their right in the election. The Romi&s;h court welcomed all parties; but Innocent quickly determined again&s;t the bi&s;hops, and adjudg|ed the whole right of election to the chapter of monks belonging to the &s;ee. K. John having taken an oath of the monks whom he had &s;ent to Rome, that they would choo&s;e none but Gray of Norwich, though<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> him&s;elf &s;afe to a&s;&s;ure the Pope, that he would ack|nowledge any whom the convent &s;hould elect.

<PB N="55" REF="59">
but a member of the Roman court; and pretending, that there was no need of princes con&s;ent in his Ho|line&s;s' pre&s;ence, he immediately con&s;ecrated him.</P>
<P>John was altogether enraged to find one wholly at|tached to the French intere&s;t placed in this important &s;tation. He drove out the Canterburian monks for electing their &s;ubprior without his knowledge. He threatened the Pope, that if he got not his will in this matter, he would prohibit every future appeal from England to the Roman &s;ee. Innocent boldly replied, that he would but involve him&s;elf in inex|tricable difficulties, if he dared to oppo&s;e the vicar of Chri&s;t, to whom every knee mu&s;t bow. By his com|mand, the bi&s;hops of London and Worce&s;ter laid the Engli&s;h nation under an Interdict of divine wor|&s;hip, except bapti&s;m of children, taking of confe&s;&s;i|ons, and giving the &s;acrament to dying per&s;ons. In con&s;equence of this, their dead were buried in dit|ches and highways like brutes; their churches were &s;hut up, and their altars for&s;aken. Had John turn|ed his re&s;entment wholly again&s;t the Roman court, he might perhaps have carried his point. But his &s;eizing of bi&s;hopricks, abbies, and eccle&s;ia&s;tical re|venues, and requiring his &s;ubjects to renew their oath of allegiance, and many of his nobles to give ho&s;tages for their fidelity, gave great offence. In|formed of the&s;e ferments, Innocent delivered him up to the devil; and by flattering mi&s;&s;ives laboured to &s;ecure the favour of his offended nobles and cler|gy. John granted the bi&s;hoprick of Lincoln to Wells his chancellor, and commanded him to receive con|&s;ecration not from Langton, but from the bi&s;hop of Rhoan in Normandy. Wells con&s;idering him&s;elf as now &s;ubject to another head, repaired directly to Langton for con&s;ecration. John in his rage imme|diately &s;eized the temporalities of his bi&s;hoprick: Neverthele&s;s Wells' duplicity-made him &s;u&s;picious of every body about him, and ready to hearken to every term of accommodation. He offered to admit Langton archbi&s;hop; to recall the bani&s;hed bi&s;hops;

A conver&s;ation between John and Pandulf, Innocent's legate, in order to reconcilement, proved quite un|&s;ucce&s;sful. Innocent and his party did every thing in their power to render John odious. They repre|&s;ented him as an enemy to the rights of the church and nation. Peter, an hermit, was employed to foretel, that his royal dignity &s;hould cea&s;e before next <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion day,</HI> and none of his po&s;terity ever wear the crown. This exceedingly hurt him among his credulous &s;ubjects. Meanwhile, it was decreed at Rome, that he &s;hould be depo&s;ed, and another &s;ub&s;tituted in his &s;tead. Having publi&s;hed this &s;en|tence, Innocent laboured to engage Philip of France to dethrone him, promi&s;ing him a throne in the hea|venly paradi&s;e, and the crown of England in <HI>fee &s;im|ple</HI> to him and his heirs, if he did. He di&s;per&s;ed his mi&s;&s;ives and agents all over Europe to per&s;uade his infatuated votaries, that it would be an eminent &s;er|vice done to God and religion to cut off this contu|macious prince, and en&s;lave the kingdom of England to the holy &s;ee; and he promi&s;ed full pardon of &s;in, and all other immunities granted to the &s;acred warri|ors in Pale&s;tine, to all &s;uch as &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t in this work.</P>
<P>Philip, with great zeal, prepared for attacking his Engli&s;h neighbour, and John rai&s;ed an army to defend his own rights. But terrified by Innocent's menacing letter, and by Pandulf's exaggerated ac|counts of the French army, John con&s;ented to deli|ver up his kingdom to the Pope, as the only means of protecting it, and to receive it back as a fief of the holy &s;ee; to do homage for it to Innocent, and give him his oath of &s;ubjection, and re&s;ign into his hand all the patronages belonging to the crown,&mdash; and, after all, to declare &s;olemnly, That he did all

this of his own <HI>free will,</HI> and with the advice and con&s;ent of his barons. This was all performed on the Monday before <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion day,</HI> in the pre&s;ence of multitudes. Having got his ends accompli&s;hed, Pan|dulf, contrary to his promi&s;e, privately &s;lipt off, leav|ing John in the hands of the devil, and the whole nation under an Interdict. King Philip was highly provoked by the Pope's mandate to &s;top his warlike expedition; but being unwilling to draw the cur&s;e of Rome upon him&s;elf and his kingdom, he &s;ubmitted. After receiving John's oath to govern according to law and equity, Langton ab&s;olved him from the &s;entence of excommunication. John a&s;&s;embled his barons to con&s;ult how the damages of the church might be repaired.&mdash;Highly offended with his mean &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Pope, they re&s;olved to take arms again&s;t him, and refu&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in recovering that part of Normandy, which Philip had &s;eized. Langton threatened to excommunicate &s;uch as would take arms, before the Interdict were removed.</P>
<P>To render his claim to the Engli&s;h kingdom mo&s;t firm and manife&s;t, Innocent &s;ent his legate to cau&s;e John make a &s;econd re&s;ignation, in pre&s;ence of his nobles and clergy, and atte&s;ted by the primate. Af|ter the Papal charter was pre&s;ented on the altar, and attributed to the directive in&s;piration of the Holy Gho&s;t, John &s;wore fealty and did homage to the Roman &s;ee, and to Innocent and his lawful &s;ucce&s;|&s;ors. Upon this, he received back the rights of his crown from the legate. The nobles con&s;idered this &s;econd re&s;ignation of his crown as a condition of his obtaining the Pope's protection again&s;t them. Lang|ton atte&s;ted the charter, but prote&s;ted again&s;t, it; and thereby drew upon him&s;elf the dete&s;tation of the Roman court. Innocent and his agents now repre|&s;ented John as a prince of extraordinary humility and piety; and the lately extolled Langton as a mo&s;t wicked apo&s;tate, and the other clergy, who had for|merly a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Roman u&s;urpations, but now a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed the barons, in demanding a re&s;toration of the
<PB N="58" REF="62">
liberties of their kingdom, as mo&s;t dete&s;table mi&s;|creants. A civil war taking place, John fought to retain him&s;elf and &s;ubjects &s;laves to the Pope. The barons, who had lately helped to en&s;lave the king|dom, fought for its liberties, and obtained the <HI>Mag|na Charta</HI> and <HI>Charter of fore&s;ts,</HI> which &s;till conti|nue the foundations of Engli&s;h liberty. John per|&s;uaded his Holine&s;s to declare the&s;e charters <HI>null</HI> and void; and while his barons expected nothing but peace, he attacked them with an army of foreigners, to many of whom he di&s;tributed the property of his native &s;ubjects. They called Lewis, heir to the French crown, to be their &s;overeign. Neither he, nor they regarded the Pontifical thunders launched in favour of John.</P>
<P>In 1216, Innocent and John retired to their grave, and not long after, Langton of Canterbury, who, contrary to the fears of &s;ome, and the hopes of o|thers, had proved a mo&s;t valiant defender of the li|berties of the Engli&s;h church and nation. The monks cho&s;e Walter one of their own number, an ignorant and &s;candalous wretch, who&s;e father had been hanged for theft, to be archbi&s;hop. King Henry III. and his bi&s;hops warmly oppo&s;ing it, Pope Gregory IX. declared their election null and void, and took the choice into his own hand. By promi|&s;ing the Pope the tenth part of all the moveables in England, for the &s;upport of his &s;acred war again&s;t the German emperor, Henry got Richard chancel|lor of Lincoln promoted to the primacy. Terrible di&s;tre&s;s and rage accompanied the levying of this <HI>tenth part</HI> for the Pope; but fears of his Papal dam|nations made the people at la&s;t to comply. Bi&s;hops and abbots were obliged to advance the money for their inferiors. They were forced to &s;ell or pawn the church plate, or to borrow money upon it at high intere&s;t from the Italian u&s;urers, whom the Pope's Nuncio had brought along with him for that pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="63">Richard dying &s;oon after his advancement, Pope Gregory, intending to have all the vacant benefices of note conferred upon Italians, or other foreigners, oppo&s;ed the monks election of Nevil bi&s;hop of Chi|che&s;ter, fearing that, like Langton, he might turn out a friend to his country. Enraged by this, about eighty per&s;ons of high rank entered into a &s;olemn confederacy to drive the Italian clergy out of all their preferments in England; and carried their point. Gregory was &s;ufficiently provoked; but Henry find|ing that &s;o many great men were concerned in the affair, dur&s;t puni&s;h but few of them. Having got Henry made his blind dupe, Gregory annulled other two elections of an archbi&s;hop; and at la&s;t him&s;elf appointed Edmund, trea&s;urer of Sali&s;bury.</P>
<P>Contrary to the expo&s;tulations of the new archbi|&s;hop, Henry admitted Otho the pontifical Legate. He brought with him a &s;ett of canons to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in a council which he called at London. They im|ported, That churches &s;hould be con&s;ecrated within two years after their erection; that no abbot or rec|tor &s;hall pull down old churches without leave from the bi&s;hop of the dioce&s;e; that no per&s;on of infamous birth, or who is ignorant or &s;candalous, be admitted to the prie&s;thood; that bi&s;hops live at their cathe|drals a con&s;iderable part of the year, and officiate on the <HI>great fe&s;tival,</HI> and on the <HI>Sundays of Lent;</HI> that bi&s;hops vi&s;it their dioce&s;es, con&s;ecrate churches, ex|erci&s;e di&s;cipline, and frequently preach to the peo|ple; that every one that brings a cau&s;e into a &s;piri|tual court, give his oath, that he doth not act from any litigious humour; that every advocate at his ad|mi&s;&s;ion give oath, that he will plead according to truth and equity; that all judges keep records of their procedure, and give parties concerned copies on demand, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The canon, which he propo&s;ed a|gain&s;t plurality of clerical charges, was warmly op|po&s;ed. The principal &s;tations of the church were quickly filled with Italians and other foreigners, li|centious enough in their lives, but tru&s;ty &s;laves to
<PB N="60" REF="64">
the Roman &s;ee. Regardle&s;s of his &s;ubjects, Henry permitted Gregory to oppre&s;s them as he plea&s;ed.&mdash; The Engli&s;h clergy and many of the people were &s;tripped of almo&s;t all that they had, for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Pope again&s;t the emperor: but the emperor's troops &s;eized it in its pa&s;&s;age to Rome. Finding, that he could do nothing effectually for the relief of his country, archbi&s;hop Edmund retired into a mo|na&s;tery. Gregory tran&s;mitted to the other bi&s;hops a li&s;t of 300 Italians to be preferred to vacant bene|fices, before any other &s;hould be &s;erved. No mat|ter, though for want of their language, they could be of no u&s;e to their flocks.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tine IV. had &s;carcely &s;ucceeded Gregory in 1241, when he appointed an in&s;olent legate to &s;trip the Engli&s;h clergy of the poor remains of their wealth. The nobles, finding Henry utterly aver&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, re&s;olved by them&s;elves to re&s;train &s;uch exacti|ons. They commanded the wardens of the &s;everal &s;ea-ports to &s;top every per&s;on, who brought <HI>bulls</HI> or <HI>mandates</HI> from Rome. A me&s;&s;enger was apprehend|ed, with &s;everal bulls, empowering the Nuncio to rai&s;e money from the clergy. The Nuncio complai|ned to Henry: but the barons boldly ju&s;tified their conduct, and repre&s;ented to him the inju&s;tice he did to his &s;ubjects, in permitting &s;uch exactions; and &s;hewed him a li&s;t of revenues enjoyed by Italian cler|gy in England, which exceeded tho&s;e of the crown. The barons empowered a knight to order the Nuncio to leave the kingdom; who, upon his &s;hifting, told him, that if he did not depart within three days, he would be cut to pieces. Finding that Henry could not protect him, he ha&s;ted off, to the no &s;mall joy of the nation.</P>
<P>When the council of Lyons met in 1245, the Eng|li&s;h barons in&s;i&s;ted for a redre&s;s of their grievances; e&s;pecially the yearly payment of a 1000 marks of tri|bute for the kingdoms of England and Ireland, as fiefs of the Pope; and of the clau&s;e <HI>non ob&s;tante</HI> in all his bulls. After waiting for a time to no purpo&s;e,

and finding, that his Holine&s;s intended only to amu&s;e them, they prote&s;ted again&s;t the payment of that annual tribute; and &s;wore that they would not &s;uf|fer the revenues or their church to be carried off by foreigners: and then returned home.</P>
<P>Innocent IV. having obtained the Popedom, pre|tended great favour to the Engli&s;h, allowed their patrons to pre&s;ent whom they plea&s;ed, and to nomi|nate an Engli&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;or, whenever any place was vacated by an Italian. But he required their bi&s;hops, under pain of excommunication, to &s;ign the charter, by which king John had rendered the nation tributa|ry to the Pope. They meanly complied. Next year, the Parliament, by a &s;olemn deputation, complained to his Holine&s;s of their grievances, particularly Papal exactions from clergymen, and pen&s;ions from chur|ches; the robbing of patrons of their power to pre|&s;ent proper per&s;ons to eccle&s;ia&s;tical charges and be|nefices; the be&s;towing of benefices on Italians, who under&s;tand not the Engli&s;h language, and do not preach at their churches, nor maintain any charity or ho&s;pitality there; that while Italians had free and ea&s;y admi&s;&s;ion to privileges, Engli&s;hmen were oblig|ed to pro&s;ecute their rights at Rome; and that the clau&s;e <HI>non ob&s;tante</HI> in bulls, was de&s;tructive of all the laws, cu&s;toms and privileges of the nation. Inno|cent being utterly aver&s;e to dimini&s;h his revenues or powers, told them, that he would pro&s;ecute his own mea&s;ures, let Henry do what he would. He loaded the Engli&s;h clergy with new taxes, and claimed right to be admini&s;trator to all bi&s;hops who died without latter wills. He appointed one bi&s;hop to levy from his re&s;ident clergy <HI>one third,</HI> and from non-re&s;idents <HI>one half</HI> of their moveables, under pain of excommu|nication, or &s;u&s;pen&s;ion. After &s;ome contrary pro|clamations of Henry, Innocent carried his point, ex|cept with re&s;pect to the effects of the bi&s;hops that died inte&s;tate. Provoked with the&s;e exorbitant ex|actions, Gro&s;thead bi&s;hop of Lincoln, a man of un|common learning and re&s;olution, &s;et him&s;elf to op|po&s;e
<PB N="62" REF="66">
both Innocent and Henry his pitiful dupe, in a manner becoming his character. He tore the Papal bulls, which pre&s;ented unqualified candidates to be|nefices. He refu&s;ed to con&s;ecrate &s;uch Italians as could not &s;peak Engli&s;h. He formed a li&s;t, by which it appeared, that Italians po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed eccle&s;ia&s;tical reve|nues in England, to the value of 70,000 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">arks; which were, perhaps, equal to a million &s;terling at pre&s;ent. At la&s;t, for refu&s;ing to con&s;ecrate an Ita|lian boy to the fir&s;t vacant benefice, in his dioce&s;e, and for his faithful remon&s;trance again&s;t the Papal wickedne&s;s, he was, contrary to the advice of the wi&s;er cardinals, excommunicated by the Pope. He appealed to the judgment of God, and continued his work in the church, and died in a Chri&s;tian manner, bearing a &s;olemn te&s;timony again&s;t the Romi&s;h cor|ruptions.</P>
<P>Henry had &s;carcely forborn oppre&s;&s;ing the clergy, by exactions for a pretended expedition again&s;t the Infidels in Pale&s;tine, when Pope Alexander IV. about 1260, demanded another for the conque&s;t of Sicily to prince Edmund. And, becau&s;e they had not mo|ney, bills were brought them from Italy, indor&s;ed to &s;ome merchant there, and every bi&s;hop and ab|bot was required to &s;ign them, under pain of excom|munication. The Pope and king obliged them to comply, the bills being a little altered. After the nation had been, for &s;even years, grievou&s;ly oppre&s;|&s;ed in this manner, Ottobon the Pope's legate a&s;|&s;embled a council of the Engli&s;h clergy at London, which enacted, That, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, lay per|&s;ons might baptize infants; that no money &s;hould be taken for the admini&s;tration of &s;acraments; that no clergymen &s;hould be in&s;talled before the preceding incumbents be certainly dead; that pari&s;hes &s;hould be no further divided; that executors of te&s;taments &s;hould pre&s;ent an inventory of their tru&s;t to their Ordinary before they begin their admini&s;tration; that no bi&s;hops &s;hall &s;eque&s;trate the profits of vacant livings; that penance &s;hall never be exchanged for

money; that no tithes be alienated; that clergymen ab&s;tain from pluralities, e&s;pecially &s;uch as are po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed without di&s;pen&s;ation or in&s;titution; that no be|nefices be held in commendam; that no patrons be allowed annual &s;ums for their grant of pre&s;entations.</P>
<P>Edward I. having a&s;cended the throne in A. D. 1272, his parliament, about two years after, enact|ed a number of &s;alutary laws for both church and &s;tate. Meanwhile, the general council of Lyons im|po&s;ed a new tax on the whole We&s;tern church.&mdash; None but Peckham deacon of Lincoln oppo&s;ed it. Having dared to hint, that the Engli&s;h clergy had been already &s;o impoveri&s;hed by taxations, that they had &s;carcely whereon to live, Pope Gregory X. de|prived him of his preferments. Not long after, he rejected Burnell, whom the Canterburian monks had unanimou&s;ly elected their archbi&s;hop, and him&s;elf cho&s;e and con&s;ecrated another Peckham a learned Franci&s;can. Peckham quickly held a council at Lam|beth, which confirmed the con&s;titutions of Otho and Ottobon; and further enacted, That prie&s;ts &s;hould carefully in&s;truct their ignorant people; that the bread in the Lord's &s;upper was both his body and blood; that uncon&s;ecrated wine merely rendered the &s;wallowing of the bread the ea&s;ier; and that which was con&s;ecrated belonged only to the prie&s;ts, who celebrate divine &s;ervice in the le&s;s important chur|ches; that bapti&s;m by lay per&s;ons is valid; that the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary points of religion &s;hould be plainly explained to the people once every quarter of an year.</P>
<P>As notwith&s;tanding former prohibitions, many continued devoting their e&s;tates to the church, to the hurt of the nation, and the impoveri&s;hment of the king's exchequer,&mdash;The Parliament, by the &s;ta|tute of <HI>Mortmain</HI> enacted, That if any per&s;on &s;hould di&s;pone of any heritable property to the church with|out the will of his immediate <HI>&s;uperiors,</HI> of whom he held that property, the&s;e, or higher &s;uperiors, might immediately &s;eize on &s;aid di&s;poned hou&s;es or lands,

for them&s;elves, as their undoubted property, in all time coming.&mdash;Edward, being bent on limiting the power of the clergy, he and archbi&s;hop Peckham had &s;everal warm conte&s;ts. The citizens and bur|ge&s;&s;es, now beginning to be called, as members of Parliament, along with the lower clergy, as a natio|nal council. In this, Edward demanded from the clergy an half year's revenue. Finding them reluc|tant, he charged the oppo&s;ers of his motion to &s;tand forth and take their trial as di&s;turbers of the peace of the kingdom. This obliged them to comply with his har&s;h demands. Accounting it an un&s;upportable burden to attend parliaments, the inferior clergy, by degrees, accu&s;tomed them&s;elves to make their grants in convocations. Next year, Edward demanded a new &s;upply from the clergy. After procuring a bull from Pope Boniface VIII. prohibiting their payment of it, they pretended, their terror of this bull as a rea&s;on of declining it. Edward &s;ealed up their &s;tores, and gave them till next parliament to deliberate on the affair. Peckham cau&s;ed publi&s;h the Pope's bull prohibiting collectors to levy it, in all the cathedral churches. Next year, Edward called a parliament without the &s;piritual members, which enacted, That all the goods of &s;uch clergymen, as refu&s;ed the royal tax formerly impo&s;ed, &s;hould be confi&s;cated, and them&s;elves outlawed; and prohibited judges to do them ju&s;tice in any &s;uit. The clergy threatened to excommunicate all &s;uch as &s;hould &s;eize their goods, without their con&s;ent; but finding, that Edward would not be trifled with, they, after &s;ome confe|rence, yielded the point, con&s;ented to pay a fine for their contumacy, and to depo&s;it a fifth part of their revenues, to be employed in defence of the kingdom, when needful. Winchel&s;ea, archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury, alone remained ob&s;tinate. But Edward's or|der to &s;eize his whole property, made him willing to part with a fourth part of it. In con&s;equence of this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, Edward and his parliament confirmed to the clergy all their wonted privileges.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="69">Not long after, Boniface prohibited Edward's fur|ther attempts upon the betrayed and disjointed king|dom of Scotland. But he and his barons little re|garded his Holine&s;s' mandates. Boniface al&s;o pre|&s;umed to put the new bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of his temporalities as well as his &s;piritual juri&s;|diction. But Edward obliged him to renounce that clau&s;e, and pay a 1000 marks &s;terling, for ever ac|cepting it. About the &s;ame time, by a large pre&s;ent of gold plate, he per&s;uaded Pope Clement to ab&s;olve him from his coronation oath to pre&s;erve his &s;ubjects liberties &s;ecured to them by <HI>Magna Charta</HI> and <HI>Char|ter of fore&s;ts,</HI> and to give him a bull declaring all ex|communication for the breaches of it null and void.

But the Papal &s;chi&s;m&punc; and the influence of the duke of Lanca&s;ter and other noblemen, that favoured him, retarded the execu|tion of it about eight years. About 1383, William Courtney archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, revived the pro|ce&s;s, in the councils of Lambeth and London.

bread is not, by the prie&s;t's con&s;ecration of it, turned into the real body of Chri&s;t; that no more power was given to Peter, than to the other apo&s;tles; that the church of Rome is no more the head of the univer&s;al church than any other; that the Pope hath no more power of juri&s;diction than any other prie&s;t; that if church-men &s;candalou&s;ly mi&s;believe, they may be deprived of their temporali|ties; that the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t is a &s;ufficient Rule of a Chri&s;tian life; that mona&s;tical and other additio|nal rules add no real excellence to Chri&s;tianity; that clergymen ought not to have pri&s;ons for puni&s;hing men's bodies. Not long after, he died peaceably in his rector&s;hip of Lutterworth, without any appear|ance of either recanting or explaining away his tenets. But about thirty years after, his bones were digged up, &s;olemnly judged, condemned and burnt.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding Courtney excommunicated mul|titudes of Wickliff's followers, who were nick-named <HI>Lollards,</HI> they mightily increa&s;ed. Taking the op|portunity of Richard's ab&s;ence in Ireland, they at|tempted to have their doctrines approven by the Parliament A. D. 1395. They pre&s;ented a &s;pirited remon&s;trance, in which they averred, That the church of England's imitation of the Romi&s;ts in the u&s;e of her temporalities, had bani&s;hed faith, hope, and charity; that the Engli&s;h prie&s;thood derived from Rome, and pretending power over angels, is not that which Chri&s;t &s;ettled on his apo&s;tles; that the re&s;traint of clergymen from marriage occa&s;ioned many &s;candalous immoralities; that the pretended miracle of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation renders the greate&s;t part of Chri&s;tians idolaters; that exorci&s;ms or clerical benedictions of wine, bread, water, oil, wax, in|cen&s;e, &s;tones for the altar, church walls, holy ve&s;t|ments, mitres, cro&s;&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have more of necro|mancy than of religion in them; that the junction of the office of <HI>prince</HI> and <HI>bi&s;hop, prelate</HI> and <HI>&s;ecular judge,</HI> in the &s;ame per&s;on, is improper and hurtful; that prayer for the dead is a wrong foundation of
<PB N="70" REF="74">
charity and religious endowments; that pilgrimages, prayers, and offerings to images and cro&s;&s;es, are near of kin to idolatry; that auricular confe&s;&s;ion makes prie&s;ts proud, admits them into the &s;ecrets of peni|tents, and gives them opportunities for intrigues, and other great offences; that women's vows to live unmarried betrays them into infamous corre&s;ponden|ces, tempts them to procure abortions, and murder their children unbaptized; that unnece&s;&s;ary trades occa&s;ion pride and luxury. This remon&s;trance &s;o alarmed the clergy, that &s;ome of the bi&s;hops po&s;ted to Ireland, to bring home the king to their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance; while Arundel, who had ju&s;t obtained the archbi&s;hoprick, a&s;&s;embled a council for condemning &s;uch heretical doctrines.</P>
<P>In 1399, the barons depo&s;ed the weak, and in &s;ome things tyrannical, Richard,&mdash;and Henry IV. duke of Lanca&s;ter, a&s;cended the throne as neare&s;t heir.&mdash;His parliament of 1400, revived the &s;tatutes of <HI>provi&s;ors</HI> and <HI>premunire:</HI> but as he, for his own &s;ecurity on the throne, courted the favour of the clergy, they continued a&s;king, and the Pope in col|lating of benefices. The parliament al&s;o enacted, That the purcha&s;ers or executors of bulls prohibiting payment of tithes, or exempting from the juri&s;dicti|on of bi&s;hops, &s;hould incur the penalties mentioned in the <HI>&s;tatute of provi&s;ors.</HI> The bi&s;hops, by royal warrants, had formerly impri&s;oned multitudes of the followers of Wickliff. Henry, to plea&s;e them and their Pope, now procured a &s;tatute for <HI>burning of heretics;</HI> in con&s;equence of which, the&s;e bi&s;hops, who, under Richard, would not a&s;&s;i&s;t in condemning traitors and notorious oppre&s;&s;ors, greedily claimed the &s;ole power of judging and committing to the flames &s;uch as they called relap&s;ed heretics. Saw|tra, a pious prie&s;t of London, was almo&s;t immedi|ately condemned and burnt, becau&s;e he <HI>could not</HI> be|lieve tran&s;ub&s;tantiation.</P>
<P>When the parliament met, A. D. 1408, Arun|del, in&s;tigated by Henry, a&s;&s;embled his clerical
<PB N="71" REF="75">
council at Oxford to extirpate here&s;y from the uni|ver&s;ity and nation. They enacted, That none &s;hould preach without licence from a bi&s;hop; that &s;ermons &s;hould only touch upon moral &s;ubjects, and &s;uch things as had been formerly taught by the church; that no books of Wickliff or his followers &s;hould be read in &s;chools or colleges; that no per&s;on, without authority, &s;hould tran&s;late any part of the Bible into Engli&s;h; that no propo&s;itions or conclu&s;ions tending to the corruption of men's faith or practice &s;hould be mentioned; that none &s;hould di&s;pute concerning the wor&s;hip of images, holy relicks, or pilgrimages, or any other point fixed by the church; and that the Heads of the univer&s;ity &s;hould, once every month, enquire into the principles of the &s;tudents; admo|ni&s;h them, if found in an error, and expel them, if ob&s;tinate. Neverthele&s;s, the doctrines of Wickliff &s;till prevailed.&mdash;When Henry demanded a pecuniary aid from his parliament, the Commons in&s;i&s;ted for favour to the <HI>Lollards,</HI> and repre&s;ented, That the clergy &s;quandered away their enormous wealth in vain grandeur and unnece&s;&s;ary pomp; that, if he would take away their temporal e&s;tates, the nation would be more able and ready to defend it&s;elf, the poor better &s;upplied, and them&s;elves more attentive to the duties of their &s;tation. In a &s;econd remon|&s;trance, they in&s;i&s;ted, That the &s;tatute for <HI>burning of heretics</HI> &s;hould be either repealed or amended. The clergy loudly reproached the Commons as heretics them&s;elves; and Henry haughtily rejected their re|que&s;ts, and wi&s;hed the rigour of that &s;tatute heigh|tened. Not long after, he refu&s;ed his a&s;&s;ent to an act of parliament for the trial of clergymen in civil courts; but cheerfully &s;igned a warrant for the bur|ning of one Bad by a black&s;mith, who could not be|lieve tran&s;ub&s;tantiation.</P>
<P>Wickliff's tenets &s;till &s;preading, were again con|demned at Oxford; and every one was prohibited, under pain of degradation, to teach them. The convocation of London having urged the archbi&s;hop
<PB N="72" REF="76">
to vi&s;it the univer&s;ity of Oxford, the Heads appoint|ed twelve of their principal doctors, along with the delegates of the archbi&s;hop, to examine the books of Wickliff, and tran&s;mit an extract of the condem|nable propo&s;itions to him and his &s;uffragan bi&s;hops. He and Henry had re&s;olved not to leave <HI>one Lollard</HI> in the kingdom: but death cut them both off in 1413, lamented by almo&s;t none, but the abandoned clergy. Ju&s;t before his death, Arundel had laboured to per&s;uade young Henry V. to pro&s;ecute Sir John Cobham or Oldca&s;tle, and other heretical lords.&mdash; Finding him aver&s;e to &s;uch cruelty, Arundel and his agents pretended that Sir John had a&s;&s;embled 20,000 of his party to ma&s;&s;acre his whole royal family. Per|&s;uaded hereof, Henry a&s;&s;embled an army, and was, at midnight, conducted to a place, where he found about an hundred of the poor per&s;ecuted Lollards, a&s;&s;embled for wor&s;hipping God, with arms about them for their own defence from murderers. Some were killed: others, in&s;tigated by promi&s;es and threa|tenings, fal&s;ely confe&s;&s;ed a plot, and that Sir John was at the head of it. A price being &s;et upon his head, he was &s;oon apprehended, hanged by the mid|dle, and then burnt. He endured his &s;ufferings as a couragious martyr for Chri&s;t. While Arundel an&s;wered to God for his treacheries and murders, Henry &s;eemed to have been convinced that he had been impo&s;ed on, and granted the Lollards an act of indemnity.</P>
<P>After the council of Con&s;tance, A. D. 1416, Pope Martin began to di&s;play his ab&s;olute power over the Engli&s;h church. He often di&s;po&s;ed of vacant bi&s;ho|pricks in the form of <HI>provi&s;ions,</HI> and annulled the e|lections of the chapters of monks. Within the pro|vince of Canterbury, he, in two years, appointed thirteen bi&s;hops. He was extremely lavi&s;h of his grants for con&s;olidating and appropriating pari&s;h churches, or of di&s;pen&s;ations with clergymen's non|re&s;idence, or laymen's enjoyment of eccle&s;ia&s;tical be|nefices. King Henry's bold remon&s;trance checked
<PB N="73" REF="77">
his pre&s;umption a little.&mdash;The parliament enacted, That none &s;hould be admitted to benefices, upon Papal provi&s;ions, contrary to the right of the patron; and the clau&s;e <HI>non ob&s;tante</HI> in Papal bulls &s;hould have no effect. Henry further demanded, that his Holi|ne&s;s &s;hould di&s;po&s;e of no preferments in England; and that him&s;elf &s;hould enjoy the Pontifical revenues of that country, whenever he &s;hould be employed in defending the holy &s;ee. When Martin laboured to evade the&s;e demands, Henry's amba&s;&s;adors prote&s;ted, That their ma&s;ter would therein u&s;e his own prero|gative. Martin, at his own hand, tran&s;lated the bi|&s;hop of Lincoln to the archbi&s;hoprick of York: but Henry commanded the dean and chapter not to ad|mit him; and &s;o he was forced to return to Lincoln and the Pope to acquie&s;ce. Perceiving that the French monks had marked their di&s;affection to him and his conque&s;ts in their country, Henry turned them out of &s;ome mona&s;teries, and put Engli&s;hmen in their room.</P>
<P>Henry VI. an infant, was &s;carce enthroned in 1423, when Chichely archbi&s;hop of Canterbury re|newed the furious per&s;ecution of the Lollards. Two prie&s;ts were accu&s;ed before the fir&s;t convocation, but got off with their life. In the following parliament, the Commons grievou&s;ly complained, That want of due clerical in&s;truction tempted the &s;ubjects to Lol|lardi&s;m, the &s;acraments not being duly admini&s;tered, &mdash;many dying without the privilege of religious cere|monies,&mdash;and ho&s;pitality being neglected through clergymen's non-re&s;idence at their charges. And they in&s;i&s;ted, That if any prie&s;t &s;hould ab&s;ent him&s;elf from his flock &s;ix weeks in a year, he &s;hould forfeit his claim to his benefice. Ru&s;&s;el a Franci&s;can, hav|ing taught, That the payment of per&s;onal tithes to the clergy was not commanded by the word of God; and that they might be better laid out upon &s;ome pi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous u&s;es, as the givers found meet, was warmly per|&s;ecuted for his dete&s;table doctrine. He e&s;caped out of the kingdom: but all tho&s;e of his order were com|manded
<PB N="74" REF="78">
to preach up the contrary: and the univer|&s;ity of Oxford required all their &s;tudents, before re|ceiving any degrees, to &s;wear, That they would ne|ver maintain Ru&s;&s;el's opinion, or any wi&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;t in defending it.</P>
<P>Archbi&s;hop Chichely having, in his fir&s;t convoca|tion, moved for an annulment of Papal exemptions and having advised Henry V. to refu&s;e the bi&s;hope o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Winche&s;ter for pontifical legate, had rendered him|&s;elf obnoxious at Rome, Martin, being now freed from the entanglements of his immediate predece&s;|&s;ors, charged him, under pain of excommunication, to labour to his uttermo&s;t to have the &s;tatutes of <HI>pro|vi&s;ors</HI> and <HI>premunire</HI> repealed; and to inform the council and parliament, that every one that obeyed them, lay under excommunication at Rome; and to require all his clergy to teach the &s;ame;&mdash;and, finally, to report his diligence herein, atte&s;ted by two credible witne&s;&s;es. Chichely's excu&s;e not being &s;u&s;tained at Rome, he was &s;u&s;pended from the ex|erci&s;e of his legantine powers. He appealed to the next general council, and to the tribunal of God, if that &s;hould not meet. Martin repeated his demands in other two mi&s;&s;ives, in the la&s;t of which he put the archbi&s;hop of York fir&s;t in order; pretended to an|nul the &s;tatutes by his own power; prohibited the bi&s;hops to act upon them; and declared all the obey|ers of them excommunicated, not to be ab&s;olved by any but the Pope, except at the point of death. At la&s;t Chichely promi&s;ed to do his utmo&s;t for the re|peal of the&s;e acts. Martin repre&s;ented to the king and to Bedford the regent, that they were obliged it con&s;cience to repeal them; and to the parliament that they could not be &s;aved, unle&s;s they voted their repeal. The Engli&s;h rulers had learned to di&s;&s;emble with his Holine&s;s. When the parliament met, Chi|chely, with great appearance of zeal, in&s;i&s;ted with the Commons, for a repeal of the criminal &s;tatutes, pretending to argue from &s;cripture, rea&s;on, and the common con&s;ent of Chri&s;tians, and then, with the
<PB N="75" REF="79">
re&s;t of his epi&s;copal brethren, withdrew. The com|mons with great &s;olemnity entered on the debate; but, after all, refu&s;ed either to repeal or amend the&s;e obnoxious acts; and formed an addre&s;s to his ma|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;ty, to procure from the Pope a purgation of the archbi&s;hop, who, they thought, had been hardly u&s;ed by the Roman court. The privy council would not allow the cardinal bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter to exer|ci&s;e his legantine powers. Nor would the duke of Glouce&s;ter, who was regent, allow him to officiate as prelate of the order of the garter. Nor was it without manifold limitations, that the council would permit him to publi&s;h the Papal croi&s;ade again&s;t the Bohemian heretics, for a levy of 2,750 men, or to collect voluntary donations for &s;upporting them.</P>
<P>In the convocation of London, &s;everal clergymen and others were accu&s;ed of heretical hints again&s;t the wor&s;hip of images; and that the Pope was Anti|chri&s;t; and for holding &s;ome of Wickliff's opinions. Such as would not recant, were thrown into pri&s;ons and dungeons, to teach them repentance. This cle|rical meeting cheerfully granted a tenth part of their incomes to his maje&s;ty. But neither the Pope's own demands, nor all the &s;olicitations of his Nuncio, could per&s;uade them to grant as much to him, nor even a twentieth part, without the king's con&s;ent. Not long after, the Nuncio him&s;elf was impri&s;oned for collecting money from the &s;ubjects contrary to law. The convocation, which had been originally accu&s;tomed to do nothing but give aids, had, per|haps in archbi&s;hop Courtney's time, begun to tran|&s;act eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, as the bi&s;hops permitted. They now appointed delegates to attend the general <HI>Council</HI> of Ba&s;il, which met in 1431; and in&s;tructed them to in&s;i&s;t for a check to his Holine&s;s' di&s;pen&s;a|tions with clergymen's pluralities of charges and non-re&s;idence at them; and his collation of dignities and benefices upon per&s;ons ignorant or under age.&mdash;King Henry e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of Pope Eugenius, again&s;t the council of Ba&s;il, and acknowledged the &s;chi&s;ma|tical
<PB N="76" REF="80">
conventicle of Ferrara, afterward tran&s;lated to Florence: but the lower hou&s;e of convocation refu&s;ed to contribute towards the expence of &s;ending any delegates to it. When Eugenius granted the bi&s;ho|prick of Ely <HI>in cominendam</HI> to the archbi&s;hop of Rhoan, Henry, at fir&s;t, rejected the bull; and when the candidate's good &s;ervices made him con&s;ent, Chi|chely oppo&s;ed his claim to the temporalities.&mdash;The convocation enacted, That none but graduates in u|niver&s;ities &s;hould be capable of any benefice; and thus empowered the &s;eminaries of learning to pre|vent the adm&s;&s;ion of ignorant wretches.</P>
<P>After Chichely and his clergy had made &s;everal ineffectual attempts for repealing the above mention|ed &s;tatutes, he, worn out with age, that he could not perform his epi&s;copal work, begged of his Holi|ne&s;s to in&s;tal Stratford the bi&s;hop of Bath in his place. Stratford and his clergy &s;till in&s;i&s;ted for a repeal of the&s;e acts, which &s;o much bridled their power. Not|with&s;tanding their ma&s;ter's &s;illy complai&s;ance, Hen|ry's mini&s;ters refu&s;ed to yield. Meanwhile, Henry Beaufort, his grand uncle, cardinal bi&s;hop of Win|che&s;ter, died, famed for nothing but &s;ordid avarice and pride. Peacock of Chiche&s;ter was a kind of dei&s;t, who extolled the light of nature above revela|tion; and, which was reckoned more unpardonable, he e&s;pou&s;ed &s;ome of Wickliff's tenets. After he had twice recanted, he was deprived of his &s;ee; and all &s;tudents who embraced his tenets were excommuni|cated, and expelled the univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>After he had reigned thirty eight years, Henry was dethroned for his weakne&s;s, and Edward IV. earl of March, elde&s;t branch of the line of York, which had been &s;et a&s;ide by Henry IV. was made king. To e&s;tabli&s;h his dignity, he granted the cler|gy every thing they a&s;ked. He &s;creened them from the &s;tatutes of <HI>provi&s;ors</HI> and <HI>premunire,</HI> freed them from the juri&s;dictions of the civil courts; and, un|der pain of excommunication, prohibited all his
<PB N="77" REF="81">
judges or officers to arre&s;t or impri&s;on any of them. He pretended to grant them the&s;e favours from a terror of the excommunication denounced by the holy canons; and that he was per&s;uaded, that the mi&s;eries under which the nation had long groaned, were the judgments of God for avenging the di&s;re|&s;pect, which had been &s;hewed to his &s;ervants. In 1466, Nevil archbi&s;hop of Canterbury held a coun|cil at York, which appointed every prie&s;t, <HI>four times a year,</HI> to explain to his hearers the fourteen articles of faith; ten commandments; two go&s;pel precepts of love to God and our neighbour; <HI>&s;even works of mercy</HI>&mdash;feeding the hungry, giving drink to the thir&s;ty, entertaining &s;trangers, vi&s;iting the &s;ick, clothing the naked, comforting pri&s;oners, and bu|rying friendle&s;s dead;&mdash;<HI>&s;even deadly &s;ins</HI> of pride, envy, anger, hatred, aver&s;ion to religion and virtue, covetou&s;ne&s;s, and epicuri&s;m;&mdash;the <HI>&s;even principal virtues</HI> of faith, hope, charity, prudence, tempe|rance, ju&s;tice, and fortitude; and the <HI>&s;even &s;acra|ments</HI> of bapti&s;m, Lord's &s;upper, confirmation, pe|nance, extreme unction, marriage, and ordination. This was materially the &s;ame with the tenth canon of Lambeth in 1281.&mdash;After Edward's dethrone|ment, re&s;toration, and death; and about two or three months reign of his &s;on Edwatd V. Richard Crookback, duke of Glouce&s;ter, his uncle, took the throne. But, after two years, he was driven out by Henry VII. duke of Richmond, heir of the line of Lanca&s;ter, who had married Elizabeth, daughter of Edward IV. and heire&s;s of the hou&s;e of York.&mdash; He had &s;everal conte&s;ts with the ambitious clergy; but his principal care was to hoard up money, and &s;o died hated or feared by all his &s;ubjects. Under his reign, Bourchier, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, brought over the fir&s;t Printing pre&s;s from Harleim in Holland to Oxford in England, in 1494.</P>
<P>Henry VIII. &s;ucceeded his father in 1509. Divi|nity, as then taught in the univer&s;ities, was his favou|rite &s;tudy. While many of his &s;ubjects were plotting
<PB N="78" REF="82">
the de&s;truction of his father's two mo&s;t rapacious mi|ni&s;ters, Emp&s;on and Dudley, he and his council were occupied in &s;ettling his marriage with Cathe|rine, aunt to Charles V. emperor of Germany and king of Spain. She had been married to Arthur his elder brother, when he was about fifteen years of age. He &s;lept with her for a time, but was &s;aid to leave her a virgin. Upon his death, Henry VII. unwilling to lo&s;e her portion, or to allow her a pro|per dowry on receipt of it, procuring a di&s;pen&s;ation from the Pope, got her betrothed to Henry his &s;e|cond &s;on, in the 14th year of his age. But, perhaps repenting, he made young Henry enter a &s;olemn &s;e|cret prote&s;tation again&s;t it. As Catherine affirmed her&s;elf a virgin, and had an agreeable and virtuous temper, Henry VIII. moved by &s;ome rea&s;ons of &s;tate, and reckoning his con&s;cience &s;ufficiently protected by his Holine&s;s' di&s;pen&s;ation, took her to his bed a|bout two months after his father's death; and they were conjunctly crowned.</P>
<P>Henry and his courtiers having abandoned them|&s;elves to plea&s;ure, Wol&s;ey, from the rank of a chap|lain, pu&s;hed him&s;elf into almo&s;t the whole manage|ment of the kingdom. A law had been made in the late reign, That clergymen convicted &s;hould be burnt in the hand; another was now made, That murde|rers and robbers, not being prie&s;ts or deacons, &s;hould be denied the benefit of clergy. Highly offended, the clergy in&s;i&s;ted, That all their orders being &s;acred, none of them could lawfully be judged by any civil court. Standi&s;h ri&s;ked both his dignity and life, in hone&s;tly oppo&s;ing his brethren. And Henry &s;up|porting the &s;tatutes, Wol&s;ey thought fit to yield.&mdash; But, animated by his cardinal's hat, and his arch|bi&s;hoprick of York, he, with great zeal, promoted a clerical contribution for his Holine&s;s to defray the expence of the Turki&s;h war. But the clergy had both wit and zeal to retain their own money. Wol|&s;ey was made the Pope's <HI>legate a latere,</HI> and appoint|ed to vi&s;it all the mona&s;teries in the kingdom; and
<PB N="79" REF="83">
empowered to vi&s;it all the mona&s;teries in the king|dom; and empowered to di&s;pen&s;e with all eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws for a whole year. The clergy were high|ly offended; e&s;pecially as the Pope's bulls granting him the&s;e powers, had repre&s;ented them as very ig|norant and profligate. They thought it very impro|per, that Wol&s;ey &s;hould pa&s;s &s;uch a cen&s;ure upon when, when his own vices were &s;o remarkable. But ob&s;erving, that their ignorance and profligacy would inevitably render them contemptible, he was willing to endeavour the reformation of the inferior clergy by every tenable method, except the drudgery of giving them a good example. He al&s;o expected that the abominable practices found in mona&s;teries would ju&s;tify his &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of them, and converting of them into cathedrals, colleges, or collegiate chur|ches. But his friends advi&s;ed him to &s;uppre&s;s them by the le&s;s invidious method of Papal authority.</P>
<P>The enormous wealth and power of the clergy had made many of them think, that they might do what they plea&s;ed, without reproach or controul. Under pretence of a Turki&s;h war to be carried on by all the Chri&s;tian princes of Europe, Pope Leo X. publi&s;hed an Indulgence which extended to both the quick and he dead; and promi&s;ed forgivene&s;s of all their &s;ins, and a complete redemption from both hell and pur|gatory, at fixed prices, for carrying on the war. The &s;ubordinate di&s;po&s;ers of the&s;e indulgences acted in the mo&s;t profligate manner. It is &s;aid, the power of relea&s;ing &s;ouls was &s;ometimes plaid for in taverns. Zuinglius of Switzerland and Luther of Germany boldly decried this abominable merchandi&s;e. Lu|ther's books &s;pread into England, and were the more eagerly read, that his doctrines appeared like to tho&s;e of Wickliff. The Lollards were therefore the more furiou&s;ly per&s;ecuted. The lea&s;t word, however in|advertently dropt, again&s;t any eccle&s;ia&s;tical law, was enough to found a pro&s;ecution; and parents teaching their children the <HI>Lord's prayer</HI> and the <HI>ten command|ments,</HI> according to Wickliff's Engli&s;h tran&s;lation,
<PB N="80" REF="84">
was thought a &s;ufficient ground of <HI>burning</HI> them as heretics. Puffed up with his own theological learn|ing, and highly offended, that Luther had &s;o freely handled T. Aquinas, his favourite doctor, Henry publi&s;hed a pretended refutation of his books. This procured him high flattery from Rome, with a new title of <HI>Defender of the faith,</HI> which his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors or the throne &s;till retain. But Luther, in his reply, treated him with very unceremonious freedom. To promote the &s;alvation of his countrymen, William Tindal publi&s;hed an Engli&s;h tran&s;lation of the New Te&s;tament with &s;hort notes. Sir Thomas More, &s;o famed for his mildne&s;s, learning, and Popi&s;h piety, publi&s;hed a virulent confutation of it. The bi&s;hops poured forth their proclamations again&s;t it, as a book infinitely di&s;honourable to God, and ruinous to the &s;ouls of men; and, from all the pulpits in the nati|on, charged all that had any copies of it, to bring them to the <HI>Vicar general,</HI> within thirty days, under pain of excommunication, and of being &s;u&s;pected of here&s;y. Some were pro&s;ecuted as heretics, but re|canted,&mdash;while Wol&s;ey's oppre&s;&s;ion of the nation, particularly his clerical brethren, with taxes, divert|ed men's minds to other objects.</P>
<P>AFTER Henry had lived almo&s;t twenty year<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with his queen, and had &s;everal children born by her, her frequent mi&s;carriages, and the improbability of her having any &s;ons, provoked his di&s;like of her&punc; Perhaps, the French and Spaniards que&s;tioning the legitimacy of his daughter Mary, when propo&s;ed for marriage with their princes, awakened his &s;u&s;picion of the unlawfulne&s;s of his own; while Anne of Bo|leyn, his queen's maid of honour, had begun to cap|tivate his capricious affections. He fir&s;t intimated his &s;cruple to cardinal Wol&s;ey, and required him to declare his mind concerning his divorcing of Cathe|rine. Wol&s;ey, having had his attempt on the Pope|dom defeated by Charles her nephew, was bent enough to do her a di&s;&s;ervice; but was wi&s;e enough to be
<PB N="81" REF="85">
leave to con&s;ult the learned men of the kingdom. The bi&s;hops and others, being a&s;&s;embled, advi&s;ed Henry to con&s;ult all the univer&s;ities in Europe, and procure their determinations under their re&s;pective &s;eals. Me&s;&s;engers were immediately di&s;patched with proper in&s;tructions to con&s;ult the foreign univer&s;ities. In more than a year, not one, but that of Orleans, had returned their opinion,&mdash;when Dr. Cranmer, then tutor to the children of a gentleman, in who&s;e hou&s;e Henry happened to lodge a night, &s;ugge&s;ted the propriety of obtaining and publi&s;hing the de|ci&s;ion of the univer&s;ities, which, if done, his Ho|line&s;s would &s;carce dare to pronounce a contrary &s;entence. Highly plea&s;ed with the hint, Henry pu&s;hed for the foreigners re&s;olution of his two que&s;tions, Whether the law of God allowed of a man's marrying his brother's wife? and, Whether the Pope could di&s;pen&s;e with the laws of God? All the univer&s;ities, except tho&s;e of Rome, and mo&s;t of the learned in Europe, Papi&s;ts, Lutherans, and Zu|inglians, declared them&s;elves in the negative of both que&s;tions. With much difficulty, and little unani|mity, the univer&s;ities of Oxford and Cambridge de|clared the marriage unlawful. Having obtained the opinions of &s;o many learned men, Henry a&s;&s;embled the bi&s;hops; who all, except Fi&s;her of Roche&s;ter, declared it unlawful, and put their name and &s;eal to their deci&s;ion. Warham, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, put Fi&s;her's name and &s;eal to it: but Fi&s;her &s;tedfa&s;tly maintained, that he never empowered him to do &s;o.</P>
<P>Having removed Catherine from his bed, Henry applied to Pope Clement VII. for a divorce. How|ever willing Clement would have been, that Henry had &s;ued out his divorce in England, and married a|nother, and got a legantine confirmation of his mar|riage, he was very unwilling to di&s;plea&s;e Charles the emperor, who&s;e favour he needed again&s;t the Pro|te&s;tants; and &s;hifted off the affair the be&s;t way he could. Campegius was at la&s;t di&s;patched for Eng|land with legantine powers, and a bull of divorce to
<PB N="82" REF="86">
be &s;hown to Henry and Wol&s;ey, but with &s;ecret in|&s;tructions to &s;pin out the affair as long as po&s;&s;ible. The matter was begun in the legantine court by Cam|pegius and Wol&s;ey. Catherine, who had ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to retire into a mona&s;tery, or to con&s;ent to her own divorce, and had employed the intere&s;t of the emperor and other friends abroad to prevent it, appeared once and again before the legates, but ap|pealed the cau&s;e to the Pope him&s;elf. Campegius adjourned the court till the en&s;uing October. Mean|while, the Pope called the cau&s;e before him&s;elf, and cited Henry to his bar. Henry commanded the earl of Wilt&s;hire to prote&s;t again&s;t the citation as contra|ry to his royal prerogative; and, in a letter &s;igned by cardinal Wol&s;ey, four bi&s;hops, two dukes, two marqui&s;&s;es, thirteen earls, two vi&s;counts, twenty-three barons, twenty two abbots, and eleven com|moners, the Pope was intreated to confirm the judg|ment of &s;o many learned men. Henry di&s;dained to &s;end any to repre&s;ent him as a pannel: but he &s;ent &s;ome to excu&s;e his non-compearance; and if po&s;&s;ible to draw the cardinals to his &s;ide. While Henry was fretted with delays, Wol&s;ey's enemies, and even Anne of Boleyn, his former friend, repre&s;ented him to his maje&s;ty as a treacherous conniver with Campe|gius, and a betrayer of his ma&s;ter's intere&s;ts. They pro&s;ecuted him for accepting his legantine powers; and in other different forms. As Henry had given him warrants for many things charged upon him as criminal, he &s;ometimes pretended to protect him. But, when he thought his danger over, he was a|rre&s;ted for high trea&s;on, and poi&s;oned him&s;elf in his way to the tower, confe&s;&s;ing, That if he had &s;erved his God as faithfully as he had done his king, he would not have abandoned him in his old age.</P>
<P>In September 1530, Henry publi&s;hed a proclama|tion, prohibiting all purcha&s;ing of any thing from Rome under the &s;evere&s;t penalties, and declaring his intention to annex the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;upremacy to his crown. Fore&s;eeing, that the clergy would &s;tartle
<PB N="83" REF="87">
at the la&s;t, he indicted them all as guilty of acknow|ledging and &s;ubmitting to Wol&s;ey's legantine powers, and by the <HI>&s;tatute of premunire,</HI> declared them to be out of his protection, and to have forfeited all their e&s;tates and goods to his u&s;e. Finding them&s;elves at his mercy, they gladly &s;ubmitted to a fine of 118,840 pounds &s;terling for his exchequer; and to acknow|ledge him their <HI>&s;piritual Head.</HI> They readily ad|vanced the money; and promi&s;ed never more to meet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n convocation, or to make any canons without his maje&s;ty's allowance. But they thought a layman's head&s;hip over the church &s;o ab&s;urd in it&s;elf, and &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with their allegiance to the Pope, that they in&s;i&s;ted to add this clau&s;e, <HI>as far as agreeable to the laws of Chri&s;t,</HI> in their acknowledgment of it. Henry for the pre&s;ent admitted their clau&s;e.</P>
<P>The parliament meeting in 1532, the Commons thought it a proper &s;ea&s;on for &s;ecuring them&s;elves and their people again&s;t eccle&s;ia&s;tical oppre&s;&s;ions; and even the clergy, finding that their pro&s;ecutions of men without any accu&s;er; cau&s;ing them accu&s;e them&s;elves on oath; or obliging them to abjure what opinions they plea&s;ed, or be burnt, were very di&s;|agreeable,&mdash;re&s;olved to amend their cu&s;toms. The parliament re&s;tricted the protection of clerical crimi|nals; explained and inforced the &s;tatute of <HI>Mort|main,</HI> which prohibited the alienation of lands to the church without con&s;ent of his maje&s;ty and other im|mediate &s;uperiors. They prohibited the payment of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nnats and fir&s;t fruits to Rome. They declared, that no excommunication on account of adherence to the&s;e laws &s;hould be regarded. Henry at fir&s;t con|&s;ented to the&s;e laws only for a year. But when the convocation be&s;ought him to pre&s;erve the liberties of the church, he replied, That no eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;ti|tutions &s;hould hereafter be made or executed, with|out his con&s;ent; that, as &s;ome of the provincial ones already enacted, were incon&s;i&s;tent with his preroga|tive, he intended to have them all examined by a committee of 32 per&s;ons, half of them clergymen,

Apprehen&s;ive of the critical nature of the times, and having his affections fixed upon a young lady, he accepted the charge with the utmo&s;t reluctance. At an interview, Francis, the French king, pretending great friend&s;hip for Henry, advi&s;ed him neither to go him&s;elf to Rome, nor &s;end any agents to pro&s;ecute his divorce, but &s;ecretly to mar|ry Anne of Boleyn, now duche&s;s of Pembroke, and he would &s;tand by the marriage. Henry did &s;o a|bout the 14th of November 1532: but it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible that Cranmer could be pre&s;ent.

<P>The tidings of the&s;e tran&s;actions had provoked Clement to con&s;ign Henry into the hands of the de|vil, had not his moderate cardinals urged him to de|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay it.

In November this year, the parliament confirmed Henry's &s;upreme head&s;hip over the church, particularly in correcting errors and here&s;ies; and, to the no &s;mall grief of the clergy, granted him the annats and tithes of all eccle&s;ia&s;tical preferments; which had been formerly given to the Pope. They framed an oath concerning the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown, and required per&s;ons of
<PB N="88" REF="92">
all ranks to take it. They declared it high trea&s;on to &s;peak again&s;t his maje&s;ty, or his pre&s;ent queen, or to call him an <HI>heretic, &s;chi&s;matic tyrant,</HI> or <HI>u&s;urper.</HI> And they made provi&s;ion for the &s;uffragan bi&s;hops.</P>
<P>When Paul III. was made Pope, Henry, by his mini&s;ter Ca&s;&s;ils, applied to him for his re-con&s;idering his cau&s;e. Paul was exceedingly de&s;irous of a recon|ciliation with England; but the news of &s;ome friars and of Sir Thomas More and bi&s;hop Fi&s;her being ex|ecuted for refu&s;ing to renounce their allegiance to the Roman &s;ee, made him lo&s;e all hopes of it. He there|fore delivered Henry into the hand of the devil and his angels, ab&s;olved all his &s;ubjects from their alle|giance to him, commanded all eccle&s;ia&s;tics to leave the kingdom, and all the nobles to take up arms a|gain&s;t him; prohibited all other Chri&s;tians to have any dealings with the Engli&s;h; laid the kingdom under an Interdict of divine &s;ervice, annulled all trea|ties made with Henry by foreign princes &s;ince his marriage with Anne of Boleyn; and declared the i&s;|&s;ue of it &s;purious, and incapable of &s;ucceeding to the crown.</P>
<P>The oath, approving of his maje&s;ty's marriage, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the i&s;&s;ue of it to the crown, and renouncing the Papal authority, had been ad|mini&s;tered by commi&s;&s;ioners all over the nation. The &s;pread of <HI>Tindal's New Te&s;tament,</HI> and of the <HI>Beg|gar's &s;upplication,</HI> which was chiefly directed again&s;t the lazy monks as devourers of that which belonged to the poor, had contributed to the conviction of &s;e|verals. But the bulk of the nation &s;till continued zealous for Popery. Such as dared to oppo&s;e it were in danger of being burnt or otherwi&s;e per&s;ecuted. But the queen, lord Cromwel, afterwards earl of E&s;&s;ex, archbi&s;hop Cranmer, Shaxton of Sali&s;bury, and Latimer of Worce&s;ter, who &s;tudied to promote the reformation, had influence with Henry, while bi&s;hop Gardiner, the duke of Norfolk, and others, did their utmo&s;t to oppo&s;e it. None were more a|ver&s;e to it than the cloi&s;tered monks, who openly
<PB N="89" REF="93">
declared again&s;t the king's procedure, begged the people to take up arms again&s;t him, and laboured to embroil him with foreign princes. To humble their pride, Henry appointed lord Cromwel, who had once been Wol&s;ey's &s;ervant, but was now made his maje&s;ty's <HI>vicegerent in &s;piritual affairs,</HI> in&s;tead of the Pope's legate, and others, to vi&s;it their mona&s;teries in the manner which he pre&s;cribed. To prevent a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rial of their behaviour, &s;ome voluntarily &s;urrendered their mona&s;teries into his hand. Others, upon ex|amination, were found guilty of the mo&s;t abominable frauds. Multitudes of pretended relicks were ex|po&s;ed and de&s;troyed. Images of pretended &s;aints were taken down and burnt, and the rich oblations made to their &s;hrines converted to the king's u&s;e.&mdash; Faction, and lewdne&s;s of the mo&s;t unnatural kind, were every where found. Having con&s;idered the reports of the Commi&s;&s;ioners for the vi&s;itation, the Parliament agreed to &s;uppre&s;s 376 of the &s;maller mo|na&s;teries, and to give their plate and other furniture to the value of about 100,000 pounds &s;terling, and their rents amounting to 32,000 pounds <HI>per annum</HI> to the king. About ten thou&s;and monks were turn|ed out, each of them with forty-five &s;hillings, equal to about the value of 27 pounds at pre&s;ent, to carry them beyond &s;ea, or to live on till he could work; and their governors had yearly pen&s;ions granted them. To ea&s;e the nation, the&s;e pen&s;ionaries were thru&s;t into vacancies, as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible; and hence mo&s;t of the inferior clergy became inveterate enemies to the Re|formation. In 1537 and 1539, the greater mona&s;te|ries were &s;urrendered into his maje&s;ty's hand, to pre|vent an examination of their manners. The clear rents of all the &s;uppre&s;&s;ed hou&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> amounted to 131, 607 pounds &s;ix &s;hillings and four pence: but their true value was at lea&s;t ten times more. With 18000 pounds of this revenue, Henry intended to erect 18 &s;mall bi&s;hopricks; but no more than tho&s;e of We&s;t|min&s;ter, Che&s;ter, Peterborough, Oxford, Glouce&s;|ter, and Bri&s;tol, were actually founded.

<P>Meanwhile, Henry, by virtue of his &s;piritual &s;u|premacy, publi&s;hed certain <HI>Injunctions</HI> for regulating the behaviour of the clergy, bearing, That they &s;hould every quarter of a year preach twice again&s;t the Pope's &s;upremacy, and in defence of the king's; that they &s;hould publi&s;h his late <HI>articles of &s;aith,</HI> and proclamation for the aboli&s;hment of &s;ome holy days in harve&s;t; that they &s;hould in&s;truct their people to make no pilgrimages to &s;aints, or their relicks; but &s;tay at home and mind their family, keep God's com|mandments, and teach them, and the Creed, and Lord's prayer in Engli&s;h, to their children; that they &s;hould carefully di&s;pen&s;e the &s;acraments in their pari&s;hes; that they &s;hould not frequent taverns, not &s;it long at gaming, but apply them&s;elves to the &s;tudy of the &s;criptures, and of a good life; that every one, who had 20 pounds a year, and did not re&s;ide at his charge, &s;hould pay five pounds to the poor, and eve|ry one that had a 100 pounds &s;hould maintain a &s;tu|dent at the univer&s;ity, or as many &s;tudents as they had hundreds a year; that a 5th part of the livings &s;hould be applied for repairing the vicar's hou&s;es, if decayed.

About this time, Henry, having corrected a tract called the <HI>Erudition of a Chri&s;tian man,</HI> drawn up by &s;ome di|vines, and approved by the parliament, publi&s;hed it as the <HI>&s;tandard of the &s;aith</HI> of his &s;ubjects.

<P>About this time, bi&s;hop Bonner of London pu|bli&s;hed &s;ome Injunctions for his clergy, which, from their nature, &s;eem to have been impo&s;ed on him by Henry, probably at the reque&s;t of Cranmer. They required clergymen to read every day a chapter of the Bible with &s;ome glo&s;s upon it, and to &s;tudy the book compiled by the bi&s;hops; that no curate &s;hould be employed without being fir&s;t examined by the bi|&s;hop or his officers; that they &s;hould in&s;truct their people in Engli&s;h, how to believe, pray, and live according to the will of God; that they &s;hould en|deavour to reconcile &s;uch as were at variance, and be good examples of love and forgivene&s;s to their flock; that they &s;hould permit none to go to taverns or ale|hou&s;es, or to u&s;e unlawful games on Sabbaths or holy days, in time of divine wor&s;hip; that they &s;hould perform the duties of their office decently and dili|gently; u&s;e no unlawful games; and never go to ale-hou&s;es or taverns without urgent nece&s;&s;ity; that

no plays or interludes &s;hould be acted in their chur|ches; that, in preaching, they &s;hould explain the whole <HI>go&s;pel</HI> and <HI>epi&s;tle</HI> for the day, according to the opinion of &s;ome learned doctor, and in&s;i&s;t chiefly on &s;uch places as may be&s;t &s;tir up their hearers to prayer and good works; that none below a bi&s;hop &s;hould preach without a licence from his maje&s;ty, or the bi&s;hop of the dioce&s;e.&mdash;When Popery prevailed, few &s;ermons were preached, but in Lent; and in the&s;e, &s;carce any care was taken to acquaint hearers with the mind of God, but to extol the ceremonies of the church, and &s;tir up men to an enthu&s;ia&s;tic devotion. &mdash;Cranmer did what he could to provide proper prea|chers, and to leave the mo&s;t eminent to labour in an itinerant manner. But &s;o few could be had, that the mo&s;t of the nation continued in gro&s;s ignorance. To help the weak, and re&s;train the wicked and erro|neous from mi&s;leading the people, a <HI>Book of Homilie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> on the <HI>epi&s;tles</HI> and <HI>go&s;pels</HI> for the year, containing plain paraphra&s;es on, and practical exhortations from them, was publi&s;hed, which were to be read to con|gregations, by per&s;ons not licen&s;ed to preach.&mdash; Meanwhile, the licen&s;ed preachers having frequent complaints brought to his maje&s;ty again&s;t them, be|gan, for their own &s;ecurity, to read their &s;ermons; and &s;o introduced that lifele&s;s and ab&s;urd cu&s;tom, now &s;o common in the Briti&s;h dominions.</P>
<P>In 1543, the parliament indirectly e&s;tabli&s;hed the contents of the <HI>Erudition of a Chri&s;tian man.</HI> Henry was &s;ubmitted to as an infallible Pope, having the faith and con&s;ciences of his &s;ubjects at his di&s;po&s;al. Even Cranmer and his reforming brethren believed the whole government of the church to depend on the magi&s;trate's will; and hence took out their commi&s;|&s;ions to hold their bi&s;hopricks only during his maje&s;|ty's plea&s;ure, and to exerci&s;e authority by his directi|on and allowance. In 1544, a faint attempt was made to reform the eccle&s;ia&s;tical wor&s;hip. Henry publi&s;hed an <HI>Exhortation to prayer,</HI> and a <HI>Litany,</HI> in which the Virgin Mary, angels, archangels, and all

the orders of ble&s;&s;ed &s;aints were invoked. The re&s;t of it was much the &s;ame with that which is &s;till u&s;ed in the Engli&s;h church. No doubt, Cranmer had a hand in the compo&s;ition; but as his power with Henry was now much &s;unk, it was little regarded by the &s;ubjects. He al&s;o obtained &s;ome mitigation of the bloody &s;tatute of the <HI>Six Articles,</HI> That none <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hould be convicted upon it, but by the oaths of twelve per&s;ons; and that all information again&s;t preaching &s;hould be within forty days, and the pro|&s;ecution within a year. Neverthele&s;s, Belenian, A|dams, Li&s;cals, Anne A&s;kew, and others, were burnt, becau&s;e they were not able to believe tran&s;ub&s;tantia|tion. All the books publi&s;hed by Tindal, Frith, Joy, Barnes, and other Prote&s;tants, were ordered to be burnt. The Parliament appeared in earne&s;t to re|duce the nation to their wonted darkne&s;s of Popery. They declared the catholic church judge of all con|trover&s;ies in religion; they appointed Tindal's Bibles, and all books contrary to the <HI>Six Articles</HI> &s;et forth, or to what may be &s;et forth by his maje&s;ty, to be de|&s;troyed; they condemned all writings again&s;t tran|&s;ub&s;tantiation; they prohibited all annotations upon, or preambles to Engli&s;h Bibles, or New Te&s;taments; they prohibited all reading of the Bible in churches, &mdash;or of the Engli&s;h New Te&s;tament by hu&s;bandmen, artificers, apprentices, &s;ervants, women, or any o|ther of weak capacities, or low &s;tations; they enac|ted, that whoever &s;hould be convicted of preaching or maintaining any thing contrary to his maje&s;ty's <HI>In&s;tructions</HI> made or to be made, &s;hould for the fir&s;t offence recant; for the &s;econd bear a faggot; and for the third be burnt.

<P>HIS &s;on EDWARD, an hopeful youth of <HI>nine</HI> years of age, &s;ucceeded him. His father, in his la&s;t will, had named &s;ixteen per&s;ons to govern the king|dom,
<PB N="98" REF="102">
till he &s;hould be <HI>eighteen</HI> years of age, to whom other twelve were added, as privy coun&s;ellors. The earl of Hartford, uncle of Edward, and afterward duke of Sommer&s;et, was cho&s;en <HI>Protector.</HI> King Edward him&s;elf, the archbi&s;hops Cranmer and Hol|gate, the bi&s;hops Holbeach, Goodric, Latimer, and Ridley, with &s;ecretary Paget and admiral Li&s;le, were the mo&s;t noted on the Prote&s;tant &s;ide. The prince&s;s Mary, the earl of Southampton, and bi&s;hops Ton|&s;tal, Gardner, and Bonner, &s;upported the Popi&s;h. &mdash;Power being chiefly in the hands of the Prote&s;tants, all pro&s;ecution upon the &s;tatute of the <HI>Six Artieles</HI> was &s;topt; and &s;uch as had been impri&s;oned for reli|gion were liberated. Miles Coverdale, afterward bi&s;hop of Exeter, Hooper of Glouce&s;ter, John Ro|gers, and many other exiles for truth came home, and &s;erved in the church. Immediately after Ed|ward's coronation, Prote&s;tants began to preach again&s;t the u&s;e of images in churches, and of ma&s;&s;es for &s;ouls departed.</P>
<P>Having begun their admini&s;tration, the Regents and Coun&s;ellors, as in the former reign, required the bi&s;hops to take out new commi&s;&s;ions, bearing their &s;ubjection to his maje&s;ty, and that they held their offices and privileges only during his plea&s;ure. This&punc; Cranmer and his fellow reformers hoped would bri|dle &s;uch as inclinced to Popery. As the inferior cler|gy, and even mo&s;t of the bi&s;hops were intolerably ignorant, Cranmer, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;ome others, com|po&s;ed a <HI>&s;econd book of Homilies,</HI> or plain di&s;cour&s;es o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the fundamental articles of the Chri&s;tian religion, to be read where none was able to preach.

<PB N="99" REF="103">
till Edward &s;hould be major. Neverthele&s;s, the greater part of the Regents approved them.</P>
<P>As Henry, by one of his la&s;t acts of parliament, had empowered his &s;on's council to i&s;&s;ue forth pro|clamations of equal authority with tho&s;e of the king, the Regents re&s;olved to begin with a general vi&s;itati|on of the church; a letter was di&s;patched in Edward's name to all the bi&s;hops, &s;u&s;pending their juri&s;diction, during the time of vi&s;itation; and prohibiting the other clergy to preach without his licence any where, but in their own churches. This was intended to re&s;train the Popi&s;h prie&s;ts from &s;preading mi&s;chief, while Prote&s;tant preachers could obtain licence to preach, wherever they had opportunity. In this vi|&s;itation, the kingdom was divided into &s;ix circuits, and two gentlemen, a civilian, a divine, and a re|gi&s;ter were appointed for each. As the divines were intended for the in&s;truction of the people, as well as for examination of eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, &s;ix of the mo&s;t grave and popular, Ridley, Madew, Briggs, Cottisford, Jo&s;eph, and Farrar, were appointed for this work. Along with the late <HI>Homilies,</HI> the&s;e vi&s;i|tors carried with them 36 <HI>In&s;tructions</HI> from Edward, to be di&s;tributed among the bi&s;hops and parochial clergy, many of them the &s;ame with the&s;e formerly pre&s;cribed by lord Cromwel, when he vi&s;ited the churches as vicar general under Henry VIII. They principally required, That all eccle&s;ia&s;tical per&s;ons &s;hould ob&s;erve the laws relative to the king's prero|gatives; &s;hould preach once every quarter of a year again&s;t pilgrimages and prayers to images, and ex|hort to works of faith and charity: that &s;uch images as had been abu&s;ed to &s;uper&s;tition, &s;hould be taken down by the clergy only; that where no &s;ermon is, the Lord's prayer, the creed, and ten commandments, be repeated from the pulpit to the people; that, within three months, every church be provided with a Bible, and, within twelve, with Era&s;mus' para|phra&s;e upon the New Te&s;tament; that none, who cannot repeat the Lord's prayer, the creed, and the

They repealed the act of the <HI>Six Articles,</HI> and what depended on it, together with the acts that made the royal proclamations of equal authority with acts of parliament, or declared any thing <HI>felony,</HI> which was not held &s;uch before. They enacted, That whoever &s;hould own the Pope's &s;upremacy, or write again&s;t that of the king, or &s;hould burle&s;que the admini&s;tra|tion of the Lord's &s;upper, now to be in both bread and wine, &s;hould be puni&s;hed; that all private ma&s;|&s;es &s;hould be di&s;u&s;ed; that all bi&s;hops &s;hall be ap|pointed by his maje&s;ty's letters patent, and continue in office only during his plea&s;ure; that all proce&s;&s;es in &s;piritual courts be carried on in his name, and &s;eal|ed with his &s;eal, excepting &s;ome courts belonging to the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. Contrary to the &s;o|licitations of Cranmer, and his fellow bi&s;hops, they be&s;towed on Edward all the lands of chantries, which had not been granted to his father, with all the o|blations pertaining to them for <HI>obits, anniver&s;aries,</HI> and <HI>lamps,</HI> together with the guild lands enjoyed by any fraternities on like accounts. They al&s;o com|manded monks to remain in their places, and apply them&s;elves to handy labour: but this act was &s;oon after repealed. The convocation, which chiefly con&s;i&s;ted of Papi&s;ts, did little more than allow the lawfulne&s;s of prie&s;ts marriage, and of giving the &s;a|cramental cup to the people. The lower hou&s;e pe|titioned the upper, That the commi&s;&s;ion of 32 for reforming the eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws might be revived; that what the bi&s;hops and divines had done, for cor|recting the offices for divine &s;ervice, might be laid before them, and that the inferior clergy might be re-admitted into the hou&s;e of commons, or at lea&s;t no act relative to religion or the clergy, be made wi|thout their con&s;ent.</P>
<P>The Prote&s;tants abroad, labouring under terrible di&s;tre&s;s, &s;everal of them fled into England.&mdash; Of the&s;e Peter Martyr was made profe&s;&s;or of divinity at Ox|ford, and Bucer at Cambridge. Ochinus, who af|terwards prepared the way for Sociniani&s;m, and Fa|gius,

Two archbi&s;hops, and &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen bi&s;hops, and &s;ix divines, were appointed to examine and reform the offices of the church. They began wich the Eu|chari&s;t, and left it much the &s;ame as in the ma&s;s book, and only added what was nece&s;&s;ary to corre&s;|pond with the communion in both kinds. They left auricular confe&s;&s;ion as a matter indifferent. Af|ter receiving the Lord's &s;upper, the prie&s;t was di|rected to turn him&s;elf to the people, and read the exhortation, and then require the impenitent to withdraw, left the devil &s;hould enter into them with the elements. After a little pau&s;e, followed the con|fe&s;&s;ion of &s;ins and ab&s;olution. At the end of this of|fice, was hinted his maje&s;ty's intent to proceed to further reformation. In correcting the other offices of wor&s;hip, they overlooked the word of God, and compo&s;ed the <HI>evening</HI> and <HI>morning &s;ervice,</HI> as it now &s;tands, from the Popi&s;h mi&s;&s;als of Sarum, York, Hereford, Bangor, and Lincoln. Only there was no confe&s;&s;ion or ab&s;olution. From the &s;ame mate|rials, they formed the Litany as at pre&s;ent. Only Elizabeth cau&s;ed &s;trike out the prayer for deliverance from the dete&s;table enormities of Popery. Before that time, it was common for preachers, after read|ing of their text, to BID prayers, directing the peo|ple for whom, and what they &s;hould pray, that eve|ry one might then pray &s;ilently by him&s;elf. In the office of bapti&s;m, the child's forehead and brea&s;t was to be marked with the &s;ign of the cro&s;s, the devil to be expelled by exorci&s;m, and the child thrice dipt in the font on its &s;ides and brea&s;t, unle&s;s it was very

weak. It was then to be wrapped in white ve&s;t|ments, and to be anointed with oil on the head, with a &s;hort prayer for the de&s;cent of the Holy Gho&s;t. In confirmation, the children, being catechized, the bi&s;hop &s;igned them with the &s;ign of the cro&s;s, and laid his hands upon them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t. In the office for burial, the &s;oul of the decea&s;ed was recommended to the mercy of God; and forgivenne&s;s of &s;in, ready admi&s;&s;ion to heaven, and a happy re&s;urrection at the la&s;t day, prayed for. To the grief of Hooper, Rogers, and other foreign divines, who reckoned them appenda|ges of the idolatrous ma&s;s, and badges of Antichri&s;t, the Romi&s;h habits of clergymen were too earne&s;tly retained by Cranmer and Ridley, for fear of too much di&s;plea&s;ing the Papi&s;ts.</P>
<P>This <HI>Book of common prayer</HI> was never laid before the convocation. The Popi&s;h bi&s;hops of Norwich, Hereford, Chiche&s;ter, and We&s;tmin&s;ter, prote&s;ted again&s;t it. But the parliament, in January 1549, appointed it to be u&s;ed through the whole kingdom, under pain of &s;ix months impri&s;onment, and lo&s;s of a year's &s;alary, for the fir&s;t fault,&mdash;forfeiture of all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heir preferments, and a year's impri&s;onment for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">econd,&mdash;forfeiture of all their goods, and impri&s;on|ment for life for the third.

Ridley placed their principal dependence on the o|racles of God. Both parties claimed the victory.</P>
<P>Not content with words, the Popi&s;h clergy rou&s;ed their votaries to arms. The rebels in Devon&s;hire amounted to 10,000 &s;trong. They demanded of Edward a re&s;toration of the <HI>Six Articles;</HI> the per|formance of Ma&s;s in Latin; the elevation and adora|tion of the &s;acred wafer in the Euchari&s;t; the with|holding of the &s;acramental cup from the people; the re-erection of images in churches; the renewal of &s;upplications for &s;ouls in Purgatory; the calling in, and prohibiting of all Engli&s;h Bibles; the rejection of the new &s;ervice book; and re&s;toration of the old forms of wor&s;hip. The court returned them a &s;oft an&s;wer: but only the edge of the &s;word could bring them to rea&s;on. In Norfolk, the rebels, headed by one Ket a tanner, amounted to 20,000: but the ear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Warwick, with &s;carce 8,000, di&s;per&s;ed them.&mdash; Meanwhile, Bonner of London, being &s;u&s;pected of di&s;loyalty, was appointed to preach a &s;ermon, in which he &s;hould declare his per&s;ua&s;ion of the king's &s;upre|macy: but having hated, or forgotten to do &s;o, he was depo&s;ed and impri&s;oned, and Ridley of We&s;t|min&s;ter was al&s;o made bi&s;hop of London.&mdash;Some A|nabapti&s;ts, having fled hither from Germany, were hunted out and pro&s;ecuted for their enthu&s;ia&s;tical non&s;en&s;e and bla&s;phemy. Joan Bocker, a woman plainly delirious, was burnt for &s;ome whim&s;ical ex|pre&s;&s;ions concerning our Saviour's not being con|ceived of the &s;ub&s;tance of Mary. Cranmer, to his la&s;ting reproach, in&s;tigated the reluctant prince to &s;ign the warrant for her execution.

dying before it received his confirmation, it never had the royal &s;anction annexed to it: but archbi&s;hop Parker publi&s;hed a copy of it under the title of <HI>Reformatio legum Anglicanarum,</HI> &amp;c. in which no puni&s;hment is mentioned for heretics. The par|liament al&s;o authorized a <HI>Book of ordination</HI> compiled by &s;ix bi&s;hops and &s;ix divines, which is much the &s;ame with that now in u&s;e. In con&s;equence of all the&s;e reformations in wor&s;hip, the council ordered all clergymen to deliver up their <HI>Ma&s;s-books</HI> and other <HI>Formulas</HI> to proper per&s;ons appointed by the king.</P>
<P>Ridley, now bi&s;hop of London, began to vi&s;it his dioce&s;e. Be&s;ides the above-mentioned Injunctions, the council now appointed him and his epi&s;copal bre|thren to remove all altars out of churches, and pro|vide communion tables in their &s;tead,&mdash;that &s;o peo|ple might no more imagine the Lord's &s;upper a &s;a|crifice. Day, bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter, and Heath of Worce&s;ter, in&s;i&s;ted, that Chri&s;tians have an altar,&mdash; and refu&s;ed to obey the council, and on that account were deprived of their office. Popular preachers were &s;ent through the country, to remove men's prejudices again&s;t the removal of the altars, which had no contemptible effect. As the people imagined that the prie&s;tly apparel added &s;uperior virtue and &s;anctity to their mini&s;trations, it would have been proper to correct their mi&s;take. Hooper, who had re&s;ided at Zurich in Switzerland, during the debates concerning the unlawfulne&s;s of compliance with things indifferent in them&s;elves, when abu&s;ed to &s;u|per&s;tition, occa&s;ioned by the emperor's <HI>Interim form of religion,</HI> having returned home, and preached with great applau&s;e, was appointed bi&s;hop of Glou|ce&s;ter by Edward's letters patent. He declined ac|cepting it, as he abhorred the &s;wearing by &s;aints, even before the Holy Gho&s;t, in the oath or &s;upremacy. Convinced of the ju&s;tne&s;s of his objection, Edward &s;truck out that phra&s;e. Hooper al&s;o looked on the u&s;e of the Popi&s;h ve&s;tments as &s;inful. Edward and his council were inclined to di&s;pen&s;e with the habits;
<PB N="106" REF="110">
but Cranmer, and e&s;pecially Ridley and Goodric, in|&s;i&s;ted, that as the things were indifferent in them|&s;elves, they ought to be retained in obedience to the law. Hooper con&s;ulted Peter Martyr, Bucer, and the Genevan and Swi&s;s divines, on this point. They were all of opinion, that the&s;e relicks of Popery ought to be removed from the church; but thought that Hooper might comply rather than be rendered u&s;ele&s;s, and breed a &s;chi&s;m in a reforming church, His ca&s;e was truly pitiable. His brethren would nei|ther &s;uffer him to live without being a bi&s;hop, nor admit him in the manner his con&s;cience approved. After &s;uffering confinement, impri&s;onment, and o|ther hard&s;hips, he, at la&s;t, con&s;ented to permit o|thers to put on the ve&s;tments at his con&s;ecration, and once at court. Being admitted, he laboured be|yond his &s;trength preaching, &s;ometimes twice or thrice a-day, to the poor people, that hungered af|ter the word of God. Mo&s;t of the reforming cler|gy, particularly Latimer, Coverdale, Taylor, Phil|pot, Bradford, Sam&s;on, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were of the &s;ame mind with Hooper concerning the habits. Nay, even Cranmer and Ridley &s;eem to have relaxed their bi|gotry; and, to increa&s;e the friends of reformation, admitted Sam&s;on and others without them, if they did not al&s;o intend to procure an act for their aboli&s;h|ment. It is certain, that when they died martyrs, they contemned them. And indeed, it was &s;trange for men of &s;uch piety and &s;en&s;e, to mark &s;uch im|moderate zeal for trifles, in a country, where John a La&s;co and other foreigners were allowed to wor&s;hip God in their own manner.</P>
<P>Gardiner and his other Popi&s;h clergy did not rec|kon the deeds of the governing council valid, nor them&s;elves bound to obey them. After he had been impri&s;oned for his di&s;obedience, Gardiner &s;till be|haved contemptibly, and was therefore deprived of his bi&s;hoprick, and &s;ent to the Tower, in which he continued pri&s;oner till Q. Mary relieved him. As he and his brethren had taken out commi&s;&s;ions for their
<PB N="107" REF="111">
office, only during his maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure, they could &s;carcely complain of &s;uch &s;everities. His deprivation and Ve&s;ay's re&s;ignation on account of his old age, making way for Scory and Coverdale to fill their &s;ees, the balance of the epi&s;copal power was in the hand of the Reformers. They therefore proceeded to correct the doctrines of the church. Cranmer and Ridley drew up <HI>forty-two articles,</HI> the &s;ame in &s;ub&s;tance with the <HI>Thirty-nine</HI> now u&s;ed. After the&s;e had been corrected by &s;ome bi&s;hops, and again by Cranmer, they were ratified by the privy council, without being pre&s;ented to either convocation or parliament. Along with them, was printed a &s;hort Catechi&s;m, compo&s;ed, it is &s;aid, by Poinet, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, tran&s;lated by Cranmer, and autho|rized by the kind's letters patent.</P>
<P>The Reformers proceeded to a <HI>&s;econd amendment</HI> of their <HI>Book of common prayer.</HI> A &s;hort confe&s;&s;ion of &s;ins and ab&s;olution of the penitent introduced the daily &s;ervice; and a rehear&s;al of the ten command|ments with a &s;hort pau&s;e between each, while the people kneel, along with a declaration, That this po&s;ture did not import any adoration of the elements, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntroduced that of the <HI>Communion.</HI> To plea&s;e the Papi&s;ts, Elizabeth cau&s;ed the la&s;t to be erazed; but it was re&s;tored at the re&s;toration of Charles II. The u&s;e of oil in confirmation; extreme unction; prayer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or the dead in the office for burial; auricular con|fe&s;&s;ion; cro&s;&s;ing in confirmation and the Lord's &s;up|per, were laid a&s;ide. The parliament appointed this <HI>Liturgy</HI> alone to be u&s;ed through the whole king|dom, after All-hallow 1552. They declared mar|riages of prie&s;ts valid, and their children capable of heir&s;hip. They re-united the bi&s;hopricks of Lon|don and We&s;tmin&s;ter. Alas! that we &s;hould find <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hem permitting fi&s;hers, reapers, and the like to la|bour on the Lord's day.</P>
<P>Day, bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter, Heath of Worce&s;ter, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd Ton&s;tal of Durham, being deprived of their of|fice, on account of di&s;obedience to the laws, Edward
<PB N="108" REF="112">
appointed a vi&s;itation of all the churches, and to bring in all &s;uperfluous plate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> into the exchequer, or di&s;po&s;e of it for the benefit of the poor. Notwith|&s;tanding all this reforming care, many of the courti|ers were gra&s;ping at the church's property, while not a few clergymen were almo&s;t &s;tarved, and obliged to become kitchen clerks, &s;urveyors, receivers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for a livelihood. While many Prote&s;tants adorned their profe&s;&s;ion, others were a di&s;grace to it. Some prin|cipal Reformers were too much inclined to &s;tretch the laws in their own favour, and to per&s;ecute &s;uch as were not of their opinion. Their progre&s;s in re|formation, notwith&s;tanding their many powerful and crafty opponents, and &s;o deep rooted cu&s;toms, is an admirable di&s;play of the interpo&s;ing power of the Lord.</P>
<P>Both Edward and they intended to have proceeded further in removing the remains of Popery, and in &s;ettling the government and di&s;cipline of the church. In his <HI>Diary,</HI> he laments, that the ignorance, &s;can|dalous lives, and Popi&s;h inclinations of &s;ome of his bi&s;hops, hindered his re&s;toring of the primitive di&s;|cipline, in the manner he wi&s;hed. Bucer pre&s;ented to him a PLATFORM of di&s;cipline, bearing, That &s;candalous per&s;ons &s;hould be excluded from the &s;a|craments; that the old Popi&s;h ve&s;tments &s;hould be laid a&s;ide; that there &s;hould be no half communion &s;ervice; that god-fathers &s;hould not an&s;wer in name of children to be baptized; that the Lord's day &s;hould be &s;trictly &s;anctified, and frequent fa&s;ts, but not Lent, ob&s;erved; that bi&s;hops &s;hould apply them&s;elves only to their &s;piritual employment; that co-adjutors &s;hould be added to &s;ome of them, and each of them have a council of pre&s;byters; that country bi&s;hops &s;hould be &s;et over twenty or thirty pari&s;hes, who &s;hould often conveen their clergy, and &s;trictly in&s;pect them; that provincial Synods be held twice a-year, and have commi&s;&s;ioners from the king to ob&s;erve their conduct. Cranmer was much of the &s;ame mind. He di&s;liked the government of the church by convo|cations,
<PB N="109" REF="113">
in which deans, archdeacons, and cathedral clergy, have more influence than the repre&s;entatives of the real pa&s;tors of the church. He appears to have drawn up a <HI>more perfect Book of common prayer,</HI> but could not get it introduced, on account of the Popi&s;h inclinations of his &s;ubordinate bi&s;hops and clergy.</P>
<P>The reformation of the Engli&s;h church being now at its heighth, it may be proper to ob&s;erve, that in their doctrine of <HI>original &s;in, prede&s;tination, ju&s;tifica|tion, effectual grace,</HI> and <HI>good works,</HI> they corre&s;pon|ded with Augu&s;tine and Calvin; that they were not &s;atisfied with the di&s;cipline they had obtained, tho' they thought they might &s;ubmit to it, till it could be rectified by authority; that they believed but two orders of clergy, viz. <HI>bi&s;hops and deacons,</HI> and that bi&s;hops and prie&s;ts were but different ranks of the &s;ame order; and that they acknowledged fellow|&s;hip with other Prote&s;tant churches, which had no bi&s;hops; and hence, till the end of Elizabeth's reign, they never urged any re-ordination of their pre&s;by|ters.</P>
<P>AS his &s;i&s;ter MARY, as well as the queen of Scots, were Papi&s;ts, and Elizabeth had been declared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ba&s;tard by the parliament, the Regents, or rather <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he duke of Northumberland, advi&s;ed Edward, &s;till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> minor, as he lay dying in 1553, to bequeath his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rown to Jean Gray, elde&s;t daughter to Lady Fran|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es his cou&s;in, and the duke of Suffolk, a lady of ex|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">raordinary qualities, piety and zeal, and next in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lood after the three prince&s;&s;es above mentioned.

her entrance into London, four weeks after the death of her brother. Bonner, Gardiner, and other Papi&s;ts were immediately liberated from pri&s;on. In council, &s;he &s;olemnly declared, that notwith&s;tand|ing her fixedne&s;s in her own religion, &s;he would compel none to it, but by the preaching of God's word. Next day, by his inveighing at St. Paul's a|gain&s;t the late reformation, Dr. Bourne &s;o provoked his audience, that his life was in danger. But Ro|gers and Bradford, at the hazard of their own, car|ried him off &s;afe. He and his Popi&s;h friends quick|ly rewarded their kindne&s;s with impri&s;onment and burning.</P>
<P>To prevent like tumults for the future, Mary prohibited all preaching without &s;pecial licence, de|claring that &s;he would not compel her &s;ubjects to receive her religion, till further order &s;hould be ta|ken for it. Alarmed by this univer&s;al prohibition of Prote&s;tant preaching, while Papi&s;ts got licences, the Suffolkers, depending on their merit in her enthrone|ment, and her &s;olemn promi&s;e to them, deputed &s;ome to repre&s;ent their grievances to Mary. She rebuked them as in&s;olent. One of them, having put her in mind of her promi&s;e, had for his reward three days on the pillory, and his ears cut off as a defamer. Bonner of London, Gardiner of Winche&s;ter, Ton|&s;tal of Durham, Heath of Worce&s;ter, and Day of Chiche&s;ter were re&s;tored to their &s;ees. Hooper, who had, with great zeal, &s;upported the rights of Mary again&s;t Jean Gray, along with Coverdale, Tay|lor, and Rogers, were impri&s;oned for preaching af|ter &s;he had prohibited it. Cranmer, who had &s;aved her life from her father's intended de&s;truction of it and had contended for her claim to the crown, and Holgate archbi&s;hop of York, &s;oon after &s;hared th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ame fate. The foreign Prote&s;tants were command|ed to leave the kingdom. Bi&s;hops Poynet, Barlow Scory, Coverdale, and Bale, Deans Cox, Haddon Horn, Turner, and Sam&s;on, together with Grindal Javel, Sandys, Rainolds, Pilkington, Whitehead
<PB N="111" REF="115">
Fox, Rough, Knox, and about forty other prea|chers, and eight hundred principal profe&s;&s;ors of the Prote&s;tant religion &s;led into foreign countries. To prevent their e&s;cape, the council &s;ent orders to all &s;ea ports to permit none to leave the kingdom with|out pa&s;&s;ports.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of October 1553, Mary was crowned by bi&s;hop Gardiner, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by ten of his dioce&s;an brethren, dre&s;&s;ed in their Romi&s;h mitres, copes, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ro&s;iers. In a parliament procured to her mind by bribery and every other &s;hameful method, the laws of Edward concerning religion, after a tedious de|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ate of &s;ix days, were wholly repealed. Severe pu|ni&s;hments were enacted again&s;t tho&s;e that &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">are to di&s;turb the re&s;tored Popi&s;h wor&s;hip, or break down altars or images.

They all confe&s;&s;ed the charge; but Cran|mer appealed to his judges with what reluctance he had &s;igned Edward's exclu&s;ion of Mary. By means of 150 new pre&s;entations to eccle&s;ia&s;tical livings, and other methods, the convocation, of which Bonner was pre&s;ident, was entirely to her maje&s;ty's ta&s;te.&mdash; They all agreed to &s;ub&s;cribe the doctrine of tran&s;ub|&s;tantiation, except Philpot, Philips, Haddon, Che|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ey, Aylmer, and Young, who di&s;puted again&s;t it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hree days, being an&s;wered with little more than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hreatenings and reproach.

<P>Provoked by Mary's apparent intention to marry Philip heir to the Spani&s;h crown, Wyat, a tru&s;ty Papi&s;t, in 1554, rai&s;ed an army of four thou&s;and forces again&s;t her, and attempted an entrance into London. His army being quickly di&s;per&s;ed, him&s;elf
<PB N="112" REF="116">
was taken and executed. Pretending, that his re|bellion was rai&s;ed by Prote&s;tant influence, lady Jean Gray, and lord Guildford her hu&s;band, were exe|cuted. The prince&s;s Elizabeth narrowly e&s;caped. Wyat, to &s;ave his own life, once accu&s;ed her; but when he &s;aw that he mu&s;t die, he declared her inno|cent. Gardiner procured a warrant from &s;ome privy coun&s;ellors for her execution; but the lieutenant of the Tower would not make u&s;e of it, till he had con|&s;ulted queen Mary her &s;i&s;ter. She di&s;owned it; but continued her favours to Gardiner.</P>
<P>Having got the nation &s;omewhat &s;ettled, Mary appointed her bi&s;hops to vi&s;it it, and rectify di&s;or|ders. Her in&s;tructions for their procedure were drawn up by Gardiner. After an angry recital of the innovations of Edward, they were charged to ex|ecute the laws, which were in force under king Hen|ry VIII. but not to proceed in her maje&s;ty's name, nor exact the oath of &s;upremacy, <HI>the&s;e encroaching on the Papal authority;</HI>&mdash;to &s;eparate clergymen from their wives;&mdash;to re-ordain &s;uch as had entered by the Form pre&s;cribed under Edward, or &s;upply the defects of their ordination by the unction, prie&s;tly ve&s;tments, <HI>&amp;c;</HI>&mdash;to compel all per&s;ons to attend the church. The archbi&s;hop of York, and bi&s;hops of St. David's, Che&s;ter, and Bri&s;tol, were deprived of their &s;ees on account of their marriage; and tho&s;e of Lincoln, Glouce&s;ter, and Hereford, by her ma|je&s;ty's plea&s;ure. Soon after, the &s;ixteen vacant bi|&s;hopricks were filled up with candidates to her ta&s;te Multitudes of Prote&s;tant preachers were turned ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for being married, even though they were willing to leave their wives, and for non-appearance,&mdash;and without being heard.</P>
<P>Philip's Spani&s;h gold having reconciled almo&s;t at the Papi&s;ts to Mary's marriage with him, &s;he has the more opportunity to per&s;ecute the Prote&s;tants As they had complained of their u&s;age in the di&s;+putes of the late convocation, the court re&s;olved to mortify them with a repetition of it, at a &s;econd di&s;+pute,
<PB N="113" REF="117">
before the univer&s;ity of Oxford. Cranmer, and Ridley, and Latimer, were taken from their pri&s;on, to manage it on the Prote&s;tant &s;ide. In the debate, which turned upon <HI>tran&s;ub&s;tantiation,</HI> and the <HI>propitiatory &s;acrifice</HI> of the Ma&s;s, they behaved with great mode&s;ty and pre&s;ence of mind; but their enemies bore them down with continual &s;houting, noi&s;e, and deri&s;ion, &s;ometimes four or five of them &s;peaking all at once. After all, they were required to &s;ub&s;cribe the articles of debate, as if they had been vanqui&s;hed. They refu&s;ed; and, on this ac|count, to their great &s;atisfaction, were declared he|retics. The Papi&s;ts intended to have expo&s;ed them in like manner before the univer&s;ity of Cambridge; but the three bi&s;hops above mentioned, with &s;even others, publi&s;hed from their pri&s;on a declaration, That &s;ince they had met with &s;o much abu&s;e and mi&s;repre|&s;entation at Oxford, they would di&s;pute no more unle&s;s in writing, and before her maje&s;ty or council, or her parliament. At the &s;ame time, they emitted a &s;um|mary confe&s;&s;ion of their faith, That the holy &s;crip|tures are the &s;ole &s;upreme judge of all religious de|bates; that ju&s;tification is by faith alone through the imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t; that holine&s;s of nature is nece&s;&s;ary in order to produce good works; that there is no purgatorial &s;tate after this life; that bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper ought to be admini&s;tered according to Chri&s;t's in&s;titution; that the denial of the &s;acramental cup to the people,&mdash; tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, and adoration of the elements, and the &s;acrifice of the Ma&s;s, ought to be condem|ned; that marriage is lawful to all men. And in the conclu&s;ion, they charge the &s;ubjects not to rebel again&s;t the queen, but to obey her cheerfully, in all points not forbidden by the law of God.</P>
<P>Gardiner's intrigues with Charles the German em|peror, had long kept cardinal Pole from returning to his native country; but his attainder being re|pealed, he now came home, papally inve&s;ted with legantine powers; and in his &s;peech to the parlia|ment,
<PB N="114" REF="118">
Nov. 27, he warmly invited them and the nation to reconcile them&s;elves with their &s;piritual fa|ther, and return to the catholic church. They readily acquie&s;ced, and had pre&s;cribed for their pe|nance their annulment of all laws made again&s;t his Holine&s;s' authority &s;ince the 20th year of Henry VIII. They received the Pope's pardon of all their &s;ins during that period, on their knees, and then went to the chapel royal in &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion, and &s;ung Te Deum; and &s;pent the re&s;t of the day in revelling and mirth, becau&s;e the lo&s;t children were now reco|vered to the Pope. The parliament &s;upplicated his Holine&s;s to confirm &s;ome marriages, judicial proce&s;|&s;es, &s;ettlements of lands, and erections of bi&s;hopricks, cathedrals, and colleges. The cardinal legate ad|mitted their reque&s;ts, but denounced the heavy judg|ment of God again&s;t all &s;uch as did not re&s;tore all the eccle&s;ia&s;tical goods, which they had in their hands. The Pope refu&s;ed to confirm Pole's re&s;trictions, and publi&s;hed a bull excommunicating all tho&s;e who did not re&s;tore whatever they had pertaining to the church. Terribly afraid of Papal damnation, Mary delivered up all that was in her power. Some of her &s;ubjects were not &s;o timerous, but threatened to de|fend their claims by the edge of their &s;word. Mary repaired the old mona&s;teries, and erected new ones as fa&s;t as &s;he could;&mdash;made inquiry who had pillag|ed them under her father and brother; and com|manded Bonner to craze from the public regi&s;ters whatever had been done again&s;t the Pope or monks, as a terrible &s;candal to the nation. To the great joy of the Popi&s;h clergy, the &s;tatute of Richard confirm|ed by Henry IV. for <HI>burning of heretics,</HI> was re&s;tored to its wonted vigour.</P>
<P>It &s;eems cardinal Pole lo&s;t the favour of the Pope, for propo&s;ing to bring back the Engli&s;h heretics by in&s;tructions and arguments. Gardiner, enraged by the re-printing of his book, which inculcated &s;ub|jection to Henry's eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;upremacy, and Ma|ry, were furiou&s;ly bent upon &s;everities, and thought
<PB N="115" REF="119">
that a few examples would terrify the re&s;t into their will. Hooper, Rogers, Sanders, and Taylor, were burnt in the beginning of February 1554, and eleven more in March and April. Their triumphant cou|rage and con&s;tancy confirmed their Prote&s;tant bre|thren, and made &s;ome Papi&s;ts think better of their cau&s;e. The Engli&s;h bi&s;hops attempted to throw the odium of the&s;e executions upon king Philip,&mdash;who, to return it on them&s;elves, cau&s;ed his Spani&s;h con|fe&s;&s;or preach again&s;t &s;uch &s;everities. Gardiner craf|tily turned over the management of them upon Bon|ner, who, bruti&s;h as he was, pretended to be &s;ick of them. About this time, the exiles abroad, by a printed paper, called her maje&s;ty to remember, that during her brother's reign, no Papi&s;ts had been put to death, and even Jews were tolerated; and they urged the nobles and commons to interceed with her to forbear &s;hedding the blood of her Prote&s;tant &s;ub|jects, or at lea&s;t allow them to leave the country. This had no good effect. As if Bonner had been too mild, Philip and Mary, by a letter, quickened him to his pa&s;toral work of extirpating heretics.&mdash; Accordingly, in the months of June, July, Augu&s;t, and September, no le&s;s than twenty-four were burnt, of whom holy Bradford was one. Not long after, Ridley, Latimer, and Philpot &s;hared the &s;ame fate. After being decoyed and terrified into a recantation, Cranmer publicly profe&s;&s;ed his repentance of it, and &s;uffered the &s;lames in the mo&s;t couragious manner, marking his grief for his fall by fir&s;t burning his un|worthy hand, which had &s;igned his recantation. Cardinal Pole, now archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, on account of his mildne&s;s was deprived of his legantine powers. Gardiner had died, mi&s;erable in both body and mind; but Bonner continued his murderous fury. The year 1556 exhibited one continual &s;eries of cruel per&s;ecutions. Numbers were burnt at a time, becau&s;e they could not believe tran&s;ub&s;tantia|tion, and &s;uch things as are equally ab&s;urd. In i|mitation of the Spani&s;h Inqui&s;ition, Mary erected a
<PB N="116" REF="120">
court of twenty-one commi&s;&s;ioners, mo&s;t of them clergymen, for the trial of heretics; and prohibited all her &s;ubjects to pray for the per&s;ecuted Prote&s;tants, or to wi&s;h that God would ble&s;s them. In her reign, according to Warner, 284 were burnt for re|ligion, of whom four were bi&s;hops and twenty-one inferior clergymen. Fifty-four others were pro&s;e|cuted for here&s;y, &s;even of whom were whipt, and &s;ixteen peri&s;hed in pri&s;on. Lord Burleigh &s;ays, that four hundred &s;uffered publicly, be&s;ides tho&s;e that were murdered in pri&s;on. The bones of Bucer and Fagius were digged up, called to give an account of their faith, and not compearing at the bar, were condemned to be burnt for here&s;y. Peter Martyr's wife having once been a nun, had her bones dug up, and buried in a dunghill.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the contentions among the Reformed added to their mi&s;ery. While &s;ome at the peril of their lives preached to &s;uch as would attend them in the night, and one congregation in London had five preachers, of whom Rough the martyr, and Scam|bler and Bentham, afterward Prote&s;tant bi&s;hops, were a part,&mdash;others troubled their fellow pri&s;oners with their di&s;putes. Some of them, being Arians in opinion, were &s;o trouble&s;ome in the King's bench, that the Mar&s;hal was obliged to &s;hut them up by them&s;elves. Harry, Hart, Trew, and Abingdon declaimed again&s;t all learning and Fathers, and la|boured to infect their companions with Pelagian er|rors. Ridley wrote them a letter, and Bradford a|nother, in order to convince them of their mi&s;takes. Carele&s;s had much conference with them for the &s;ame end. They even wrote again&s;t one another, in the pri&s;on. I do not find that any of the&s;e <HI>Arians</HI> or <HI>free-willers</HI> dared to ri&s;k a martyrdom for truth. But the contentions they rai&s;ed, drew reproach on the Prote&s;tant religion, and made the Papi&s;ts to tri|umph over it.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that fled to foreign parts, were no le&s;s plagued with contentions. The Lutheran clergy,

except Melancthon and a few others of his mild tem|per, oppo&s;ing their having &s;helter among them, mo&s;t of them fixed their re&s;idence at Embden, Stra&s;burgh, Zurich, Ba&s;il, and &s;ome other places in Flanders, Switzerland, and Germany, e&s;pecially at Frankfort on the Mein. There Whittingham, Williams, Sut|ton, and Wood, with their families and friends, took up their abode in 1554, and were allowed by the magi&s;trates to meet for public wor&s;hip, in the French church, but at different hours. They and the French exiles agreed to &s;ub&s;cribe the Confe&s;&s;ion of the French Prote&s;tants, and to make no quarrel one with another about rites of wor&s;hip. The En|gli&s;h al&s;o agreed among them&s;elves to forbear an|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wering aloud after the mini&s;ter, and to drop the li|tany and the &s;urplice; and that, after a general con|fe&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, they &s;hould &s;ing a p&s;alm, and then the mini&s;ter pray, preach, and again pray, &s;ubjoin|ing the Lord's prayer, &s;ing another p&s;alm, and di&s;|mi&s;s the congregation with a &s;olemn ble&s;&s;ing. Hav|ing agreed to choo&s;e a mini&s;ter and deacon, they in|vited their &s;cattered brethren to &s;hare of their hap|pine&s;s.

The Frankforters having con&s;ulted Calvin, he replied, That there were in the Engli&s;h liturgy many intolerable <HI>fooleries,</HI> which godly men ought to reform, as they had opportunity; and that he knew not what they could mean, who were &s;o fond of the dregs of Popery, where they had full liberty to e&s;tabli&s;h whatever was mo&s;t for edification. They therefore agreed to retain their own order.</P>
<P>About the end of April 1555, Dr. Cox, who had been tutor to king Edward, a man of great pride, and of no &s;mall credit with his countrymen, and &s;ome of his friends, coming to Frankfort, di&s;turbed the wor&s;hip of God, by an&s;wering aloud after the mini|&s;ter. Next Lord's day, one of them, without the con&s;ent of the congregation, mounted the pulpit&punc; and read the liturgy. Knox, in his &s;ermon, taxed them with breach of agreement, and affirmed, that &s;ome things in the &s;ervice book were &s;uper&s;titious. Cox prevailed with the magi&s;trates to forbid Knox preaching any more in that place. Knox's friends applying to the magi&s;trates, they appointed the con|gregation to unite with the French church in both di&s;cipline and ceremonies, according to their fir&s;t agreement. Provoked by this, Cox and his friends, in a manner &s;uperlatively ba&s;e, accu&s;ed Knox of high trea&s;on again&s;t the emperor, on account of &s;ome &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions in his <HI>Engli&s;h admonition,</HI> publi&s;hed about four years before. Unwilling to ri&s;k the em|peror's re&s;entment, the &s;enate of Frankfort re&s;pect|fully de&s;ired Knox to leave the place. Cox and his party, &s;trengthened by the arrival of other divines&punc;
<PB N="119" REF="123">
procured the magi&s;trates permi&s;&s;ion to u&s;e the &s;er|vice book. Knox's friends offered to &s;ubmit the di&s;pute to the arbitration of foreign divines: but they refu&s;ed, and &s;olicited Calvin to countenance their ceremoniali&s;m. He ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed, and told them, That he &s;aw no rea&s;on for burdening the church with &s;uch offen&s;ive and hurtful things; and that their conduct toward Knox was neither bro|therly nor pious;&mdash;and be&s;ought them to &s;tudy peace among them&s;elves. This mi&s;&s;ive having no effect upon the&s;e ceremoniali&s;ts, the old congregati|on were obliged to yield and leave the place. Some of them went with Fox to Ba&s;il, others to Geneva, where they cho&s;e Knox to be their pa&s;tor, and for|med their church after the model of that place.&mdash; They publi&s;hed their plan in Engli&s;h, directed to their brethren at home; and hinted, that finding &s;ome rites of the &s;ervice book apt to do hurt, they had laid them a&s;ide, as Hezekiah did the brazen &s;erpent, and the primitive church their love fea&s;ts. In a few months after they had forced out their brethren, Horn, pa&s;tor of the new Frankforters, fell into a conte&s;t with A&s;hby, one of the principal members. The elders gave judgment again&s;t A&s;hby. He appealed to the people. After the mo&s;t furious and &s;hameful contention, the magi&s;trates were ob|liged to interpo&s;e, and order them to draw up a more perfect plan of di&s;cipline, which might regu|late their affairs. The congregation did &s;o, and mo&s;t of them &s;ub&s;cribed it. But Horn, and about twelve others di&s;&s;ented, and appealed to the magi&s;trates.&mdash; After patient hearing of both parties, the magi&s;trates decided in favour of the congregation. Upon which Horn and his friends left the place.</P>
<P>In 1558, Mary died, after a &s;hort reign, unhappy to her&s;elf and her &s;ubjects. The capture of Calais by the French, bloody per&s;ecution, contagious di&s;|tempers, exce&s;&s;ive &s;torms and inundations, had ren|dered mo&s;t of the nation ab&s;olutely mi&s;erable. Ma|ry was the object of her hu&s;band's contempt. She
<PB N="120" REF="124">
was gro&s;ly ignorant, melancholy, cruel, and revenge|ful. Her con&s;cience being blindly directed by her Confe&s;&s;or, &s;he never but once pardoned a per&s;on ac|cu&s;ed of here&s;y. Her parliament hated her cruelty, and unwillingly granted her &s;upplies. None but the Popi&s;h clergy lamented her death.</P>
<P>UNDER her &s;i&s;ter, ELIZABETH had run no &s;mall hazard of her life, and had met with no &s;mall abu&s;e and hard&s;hip in her impri&s;onment. Gardiner had often moved for her death. King Philip had befriended her, intending, it is iike, to make her his queen, after Mary's death. She had &s;carcely a&s;cended the throne, when &s;he manife&s;ted too much of her father, and that &s;he affected pompous wor&s;hip, and as much of the Popi&s;h religion as could con|&s;i&s;t with the maintenance of her own legitimacy and &s;upreme head&s;hip over the church. She was crown|ed in the Popi&s;h manner, and notified her acce&s;&s;ion to his Holine&s;s. But he claimed England as a fief of the Romi&s;h &s;ee, and declared it high pre&s;umption in her, a ba&s;tard, to think of taking the crown wi|thout his con&s;ent. This produced her immediate breach with Rome. As &s;ome Prote&s;tant preachers began to make u&s;e of the &s;ervice book without li|cence, the Papi&s;ts took the alarm. To prevent di&s;|putes, &s;he prohibited all preaching, till the parlia|ment &s;hould meet, and allowed the clergy only to read the <HI>go&s;pels</HI> and <HI>epi&s;tles</HI> for the day, and the <HI>ten commandments</HI> in Engli&s;h, and to repeat the <HI>Lord'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> prayer,</HI> and the <HI>Creed.</HI></P>
<P>The exiles abroad prepared to return home, and reconciliatory letters pa&s;&s;ed betwixt them. The&s;e of Geneva in&s;i&s;ted for an entire and mutual burial of all offences; and that their brethren of Ba&s;il, Stra&s;burgh, Frankfort, Worms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> would unite with them in labouring to obtain a &s;ettled form o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wor&s;hip, like to that of the be&s;t reformed churches&punc; which they had &s;een. They promi&s;ed to join in re|que&s;ting her maje&s;ty, That nothing burden&s;ome to
<PB N="121" REF="125">
tender con&s;ciences might be impo&s;ed. After &s;uch preparation, the exiles returned home, with nothing but their learning and experience. Their friends a|broad wrote after them, be&s;eeching them to labour to have their reformation as complete as po&s;&s;ible at fir&s;t, and to lay a&s;ide all relicks of Popery, otherwi&s;e they might afterward find all &s;truggling to remove them, to no purpo&s;e. Jewel, Cox, Grindal, Pil|kington, and others, in their an&s;wers, profe&s;&s;ed their concern to do &s;o; and complained that the nation were &s;o carele&s;s about the purity of wor&s;hip; and that Elizabeth retained crucifixes, cro&s;&s;es, light|ed con&s;ecrated candles, and Popi&s;h ve&s;tments in her family and chapel, and was bent to have the &s;crip|tures received upon the authority of the church, But they had not courage to act up to their views, or to &s;tand by one another. Such as &s;upplely com|plied with her maje&s;ty's will, were promoted to bi|&s;hopricks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and &s;uch as did not, after a tempo|rary permi&s;&s;ion to preach, were &s;u&s;pended, and re|duced to their former depth of poverty.</P>
<P>The ordinary methods of procuring a parliament to the &s;overeign's will being taken, they re&s;umed for the crown all the fir&s;t fruits and tithes, which Mary had re&s;tored to the church. They repealed &s;ome of the penal laws. They appointed public wor&s;hip in a known tongue. They empowered her maje&s;ty to nominate bi&s;hops to all the vacant &s;ees;&mdash;and re|&s;tored to her the <HI>&s;upremacy</HI> over the church, which had been claimed by her father and brother; and required all in public employments, civil or &s;acred, to &s;wear an oath acknowledging the &s;ame. By <HI>this &s;upremacy,</HI> the &s;overeigns did not claim a power of preaching or admini&s;tering &s;acraments; but the acts e&s;tabli&s;hing and explaining it, make them judges of what doctrine is to be preached: they, by their de|legates in &s;piritual courts, are &s;upreme judges in points of di&s;cipline; they have power to ratify canons rela|tive to church di&s;cipline and government, without con&s;ent of either convocation or parliament; and to
<PB N="122" REF="126">
appoint whatever ceremonies they think proper for advancing the glory of God and the edification of his church; they have the &s;ole power of nominating bi&s;hops, who mu&s;t be cho&s;en, and no other,&mdash;and who cannot act but by royal commi&s;&s;ion. No con|vocation can meet or act without royal indiction, and appointment of their bu&s;ine&s;s. All appeals formerly made to Rome, fall into the king's chancery, to be judged by his delegates. Thus, excepting clerical mini&s;trations, the kings of England have the &s;ame power as the Pope once had.</P>
<P>It was next re&s;olved to e&s;tabli&s;h an uniformity of wor&s;hip and ceremonies. To prepare the way, Eli|zabeth appointed nine Popi&s;h bi&s;hops to di&s;pute in writing again&s;t as many Prote&s;tants, before her&s;elf, her council, and hou&s;es of parliament,&mdash;Whether the u&s;e of an unknown tongue in the public wor&s;hip of God be not contrary to &s;cripture, and the cu&s;tom of the primitive church? Whether every particular church hath power to alter her own ceremonies, as appears mo&s;t conducive to the general edification of her members? and, Whether the word of God re|pre&s;ents the ma&s;s as a propitiatory &s;acrifice for the &s;ins of the quick and the dead? But the Popi&s;h doctors gave up the debate on the very fir&s;t day, pre|tending, That the catholic cau&s;e ought never to be &s;ubmitted to &s;uch a laical arbitration. The Refor|mers them&s;elves were not of one mind relative to the <HI>ceremonies</HI> and the <HI>&s;ervice book.</HI> Some were for in|troducing the Form drawn up by the Genevan exiles. Others, among whom Elizabeth was chief, inclined to retain all the ceremonies, which could po&s;&s;ibly con&s;i&s;t with the purity of doctrine, and the indepen|dence of the church on the Pope. She even appoin|ted Parker, Grindal, Cox, Pilkington, Whitehead, and &s;ome others, to review Edward's &s;econd Book of common prayer, and to &s;trike out of it all pa&s;&s;ages that might offend the Pope or his friends; and to make every body ea&s;y with re&s;pect to the corporal pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t in his &s;upper,&mdash;but to alter no|thing
<PB N="123" REF="127">
in favour of &s;crupulous Prote&s;tants. This Book thus purged, or rather made wor&s;e, was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by law. In Edward's time, <HI>kneeling</HI> or <HI>&s;tan|ding</HI> at the Lord's &s;upper were held indifferent, and only the &s;urplice was at la&s;t retained. Now <HI>kneeling</HI> was commanded; <HI>copes</HI> and other Popi&s;h ve&s;tments, as well as <HI>fe&s;tivals,</HI> and their <HI>eves,</HI> were re-appointed. In the&s;e modes of wor&s;hip, the parliament required an exact uniformity; and that who&s;oever unnece&s;|&s;arily ab&s;ented from church, &s;hould pay a fine of twelve pence for each fault. Nor had Elizabeth been content with all this, unle&s;s the parliament had em|powered her to appoint what further ceremonies &s;he found nece&s;&s;ary. Upon this rock of uniformity the &s;till remaining corruptions and the almo&s;t perpetual divi&s;ions and often repeated per&s;ecutions of the be&s;t in the nation were founded. In the convocation, the Popi&s;h doctors made a con&s;iderable &s;tand for their religion; and, for di&s;burdening their con&s;ciences, pre&s;ented to the Lord privy &s;eal, a Remon&s;trance in &s;upport of <HI>tran&s;ub&s;tantiation,</HI> the <HI>propitiatory &s;acrifice of the Ma&s;s,</HI> the <HI>Pope's &s;upremacy,</HI> and <HI>clergymen's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ole power to judge</HI> of matters of faith or di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was the parliament di&s;&s;olved, in 1559, than all the bi&s;hops were required to &s;wear the <HI>oath of &s;upremacy,</HI> acknowledging the queen <HI>&s;upreme go|vernor of the church in all cau&s;es.</HI> Death having of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ate &s;ea&s;onably cut off many of them, only fifteen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">emained, all of whom, except Kitchin of Lundaff, ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed to take it, and were therefore de|prived of their &s;ees.

Gilpin, Coverdale, Knox, and Sam&s;on, had offers of them, but they refu&s;ed to accept, on account of the ceremonies and ve&s;tments. Grindal, Parkhur&s;t, San|dys, and &s;ome others, accepted them with trembling, in hopes of an after correction of the &s;ettlement. As none of the Marian bi&s;hops would concur in the con|&s;ecration of Parker to be archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, it was performed at Lambeth by Barlow bi&s;hop elect of Chiche&s;ter, and Scorey elect of Hereford, who officiated in their &s;urplice and chimere; and Cover|dale once bi&s;hop of Exeter, and Hodgkins &s;uffragan of Bedford, in their long gowns. The ceremony was performed by prayer and laying on of hands, without gloves, &s;andals, ring, &s;lippers, mitre, pall, or any other of the Aaronical ve&s;tments. How Par|ker, &s;uch a zealous &s;tickler for Romi&s;h apparel, could be content with &s;uth plainne&s;s, I know not. As the Papi&s;ts terribly exclaimed again&s;t this ordination, the parliament, about &s;even years after, confirmed it.&mdash; At fir&s;t Elizabeth's bi&s;hops were poor and &s;omewhat moderate; but as their wealth increa&s;ed, &s;o did their pomp, and their lording it over their clerical bre|thren.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h reformation was now fixed; but nei|ther clergy nor people were uniform in their views.

&mdash;to proceed again&s;t the ob&s;tinate by impri&s;onment, church cen&s;ures, and other legal methods;&mdash;and to rectify all di&s;orders relative to religion and benefices. &mdash;As Elizabeth retained in her chapel, her altar, crucifix, and lighted candles by day,&mdash;the &s;ervice was &s;ung not only with organs, but with cornets and &s;ackbuts on the &s;olemn fe&s;tivals, and could not be ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from that of the Popi&s;h cathe|drals, the commi&s;&s;ioners di&s;plea&s;ed her by their de|&s;troying of images and other relicks of Popery. In their vi&s;itation they found, that though &s;carcely 200, or 240 of the Popi&s;h clergy had quitted their livings, their places could not be &s;upplied, many of the re|formed exiles &s;crupling at the terms of uniformity required by the <HI>Injunctions,</HI> and Elizabeth choo&s;ing rather to damn her &s;ubjects through ignorance, than di&s;pen&s;e with a relick of Popery.</P>
<P>As her maje&s;ty was not fond of the doctrinal arti|cles of Edward, and it was yet un&s;afe to permit the convocation to judge of them, <HI>eleven articles</HI> con|cerning the nature of God; the &s;ufficiency of the &s;criptures; the nature of the church; the power of civil magi&s;trates; the power of the Pope; the recti|tude of the newly corrected &s;ervice book; the nulli|ty of the propitiatory &s;acrifice of the ma&s;s; the com|munion in both bread and wine; the unprofitable|ne&s;s of images, relicks, and feigned miracles; the advantages of true holine&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;an a&s;&s;ent to this Confe&s;&s;ion of faith, full compliance with the &s;ervice book, and &s;wearing the oath of allegiance, were the terms of mini&s;terial communion.

But Parker, who, before his advancement, was humble and mo|de&s;t, now, like his mi&s;tre&s;s, cho&s;e rather to have millions of &s;ouls peri&s;hing in ignorance, than that a pious and learned &s;crupler at &s;ome relicks of Po|pery required by the act of uniformity, &s;hould be allowed to in&s;truct them. Having fini&s;hed his vi&s;i|tation, Parker fixed the le&s;&s;ons of &s;cripture for all the holy days in the year, that preachers might no longer have liberty to read what they thought mo&s;t edifying to their hearers, or to read the oracles of God in&s;tead of apocryphal fables.</P>
<P>To confirm the royal &s;upremacy, the parliament, in 1562, appointed the oath, acknowledging it, to be carefully impo&s;ed on all the clergy, judges, and advocates; and that the fir&s;t refu&s;al of it &s;hould ren|der them <HI>outlaws,</HI> the &s;econd render them <HI>traitors.</HI> (But Elizabeth and Parker protected mo&s;t of the Pa|pi&s;ts from having occa&s;ion to refu&s;e it.) They al&s;o appointed the Bible and Book of common prayer to be tran&s;lated into the Wel&s;h tongue, and a copy of it provided for every cathedral and pari&s;h church in their country. In the convocation many clergymen were &s;o ignorant, that they could not write their own names. They agreed upon and &s;ub&s;cribed the <HI>Thir|ty-nine Articles,</HI> which were afterward in part con|firmed by the parliament 1571. Bi&s;hop Sandys brought in an addre&s;s to her maje&s;ty, be&s;eeching her to remove out of the &s;ervice or prayer book, the warrant for private bapti&s;m, and for bapti&s;m by wo|men,&mdash;di&s;allow the cro&s;&s;ing in bapti&s;m; and to ap|point commi&s;&s;ioners for reforming the eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws. Another paper &s;ub&s;cribed by about 32 mem|bers reque&s;ted, That the whole congregation &s;hould &s;ing the p&s;alms, and organs be laid a&s;ide; that none but mini&s;ters &s;hould baptize, and they be allowed to forbear &s;igning the baptized with the cro&s;s; that

kneeling at the Lord's &s;upper be held indifferent; that the u&s;e of copes, &s;urplices, and other Popi&s;h ve&s;tments be removed; that that which relates to the puni&s;hment of non-conformi&s;ts in the articles be mitigated; that all holy days dedicated to the ho|nour of creatures be abrogated, or at lea&s;t people have liberty to attend their ordinary work immedi|ately after public wor&s;hip. This not plea&s;ing, ano|ther paper was pre&s;ented, reque&s;ting, That all holy days, except Sabbath days and fe&s;tivals relating to Chri&s;t, be aboli&s;hed; that, in reading the prayers, mini&s;ters turn their face to the people, that they may hear and be edified; that the cro&s;s in bapti&s;m be o|mitted, as tending to &s;uper&s;tition; that many being unable to kneel at the &s;acrament, and others kneel and knock &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly, the order of kneeling may be left to the di&s;cretion of every ordinary; that no more but the &s;urplice be impo&s;ed in the apparel of mini&s;ters in executing their office; that the u&s;e of organs be omitted. After much warm di&s;putation, this paper was approved by 43 of the mo&s;t learned, a|gain&s;t 35 of pre&s;ent members; but 24 ab&s;ents by proxy voting again&s;t it, and only 15 for it, it was lo&s;t by one vote of an ab&s;ent, who had heard nothing of the debate.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t all the noted Engli&s;h divines had te&s;tified their di&s;like of the Popi&s;h ve&s;tments impo&s;ed on the clergy. Sundry foreigners, and particularly the Ge|nevans, had declared again&s;t them, and advi&s;ed to a more perfect reformation. But &s;o zealous were E|lizabeth, Parker, and their agents, that the great Martyrologi&s;t Fox, and Coverdale, could have no preferment, and &s;carcely liberty to preach, on ac|count of their &s;crupling at &s;uch relicks of &s;uper&s;tition or idolatry. Parker, who directed his clergy not to tender the oath of &s;upremacy to Papi&s;ts, except in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity, for fear of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing them,&mdash;by Elizabeth's order, drew up &s;ome adverti&s;ements, which obliged every preacher to take out a new li|cence, which could not be had, without declaring

for Parker. Several Heads and others of the uni|ver&s;ity of Cambridge once and again be&s;ought Cecil their chancellor, That they might be di&s;pen&s;ed with as to the habits; which gave great offence at court. Neverthele&s;s, that univer&s;ity was long a ne&s;t and re|fuge of Puritans. They retained their right of &s;en|ding forth twelve preachers yearly, who might preach for life, without any licence from the bi&s;hop; which contributed to the edification of many thou&s;and &s;ouls. Meanwhile, the other Puritan preachers partly fled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nto foreign countries, partly betook them&s;elves to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ecular employments, or to be chaplains to per&s;ons of rank; and many, who had large families, were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">educed to beggary.</P>
<P>When the refu&s;ers of the habits and ceremonies found them&s;elves extremely traduced by their ene|mies, they began to publi&s;h tracts for their own vin|dication. The High Commi&s;&s;ioners procured a deed of the privy council prohibiting the printing or vend|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng of them. Provoked with this re&s;traint, and with the &s;ilencing, &s;eque&s;tration, and impri&s;onment of &s;o many of their faithful pa&s;tors and preachers, for mere &s;cruples at the robes and ceremonies of Anti|chri&s;t, many of the people began &s;o &s;eparate from the conforming clergy, and meet for wor&s;hip by them&s;elves; in doing which, they laid a&s;ide the li|turgy, and followed the plan of Geneva. It ought to be remembered, that though the Robes were mo&s;t readily &s;poken of amid&s;t the&s;e contentions, yet the Puritans complained of many things be&s;ide. They did not allow of the office of bi&s;hops to be &s;uperior to that of pre&s;byters; or of bi&s;hops temporal digni|ties and &s;ecular tru&s;ts; they di&s;liked the titles and offices of <HI>archde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ons, deans, chapters,</HI> and other of|ficials in cathedral churches; they condemned the exorbitant power and oppre&s;&s;ive conduct of the bi|&s;hops and their chancellors, and their &s;piritual courts; the putting of excommunication and ab&s;olution into the hands of laymen; promi&s;cuous admi&s;&s;ion of peo|ple to the Lord's table, however ignorant or licen|tious;
<PB N="132" REF="136">
they lamented the total want of Chri&s;tian di&s;|cipline; they di&s;liked re&s;triction of mini&s;ters to <HI>&s;et forms</HI> of prayer and the vain repetitions pre&s;cribed in the <HI>common prayers;</HI> they di&s;liked &s;everal expre&s;&s;ions in the office of marriage, burial, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the read|ing of &s;o much of the Apocrypha, to the exclu&s;ion of a large part of the word of God; they complain|ed, That there were &s;o many unpreaching pa&s;tors, &s;o many pluralities and non-re&s;idents; and that mi|ni&s;ters were intruded by patronage, without regard to the choice of the people: they dete&s;ted the ob|&s;ervation of &s;o many holy days of human appoint|ment, while buying and &s;elling on the Lord's day were permitted: they di&s;approved in&s;trumental mu|&s;ic, &s;inging of prayers, and other relicks of Papal forms in cathedral churches; they &s;crupled the u&s;e of the cro&s;s in bapti&s;m, and the officiating of godfa|thers and godmothers in place of the true parents: they di&s;liked the manner of confirmation upon &s;o ea&s;y terms, as well as the pretence, that impo&s;ition of the bi&s;hops hands certified per&s;ons of their real &s;aint&s;hip: they di&s;liked the obliging of communicants to kneel at the Lord's &s;upper,&mdash;or to bow at the pronunciati|on of the name JESUS; they di&s;liked the u&s;e of the ring in marriage as a &s;acramental &s;ymbol; nor could they believe, that the u&s;e of Popi&s;h robes or ceremo|nies in divine &s;ervice promoted the edification of men's &s;ouls.</P>
<P>Coverdale, Sam&s;on, Fox, Humphreys, and others of the Puritan clergy, continued in the church, and became itinerant preachers, lecturers, or chaplains, as they had opportunity. But Coleman, Button, Halingham, Ben&s;on, White, Rowland, and Haw|kins, mini&s;ters of London, looking upon the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed church as ob&s;tinate in her adherence to many dregs of Popery, and in per&s;ecuting the faithful fol|lowers of Chri&s;t, &s;eparated from her, and privately preached in hou&s;es and woods. Informed of this, Elizabeth publi&s;hed a proclamation, That whoever
<PB N="133" REF="137">
did not attend their own churches, but attended conventicles, &s;hould for the fir&s;t offence be deprived of the freedom of London, and afterward abide the puni&s;hment directed by law. One of the&s;e private meetings being detected, many were apprehended, who, before bi&s;hop Grindal and other judges, be|haved in a mo&s;t bold and Chri&s;tian manner. After lying a year in pri&s;on, twenty-four men and &s;even women were &s;et free. Neither the remarkable piety, nor the nervous arguments, nor the &s;ufferings of the&s;e Puritans could move the High commi&s;&s;ioners. They had their &s;pies in all &s;u&s;pected places, to pre|vent their a&s;&s;embling for wor&s;hip, and prohibited all preaching in London, without &s;pecial licence, from the bi&s;hop or archbi&s;hop.</P>
<P>In 1568, the bi&s;hops publi&s;hed their Bible, which was merely that of Tindal &s;omewhat corrected, and with &s;ome maps, cuts, and notes: but they little re|garded it in dealing with their &s;crupulous brethren. Prote&s;tants being terribly pro&s;ecuted in France and the Netherlands, many of them fled into England, and &s;ettled in London and other trading places.&mdash; Regard to the erection of manufactures, and care to weaken her neighbouring princes, moved Elizabeth to permit them their own modes of wor&s;hip. She and Parker had been extremely kind to her Popi&s;h &s;ubjects, and had i&s;&s;ued directions to prevent bring|ing them under hard&s;hips by the impo&s;ition of the oath of &s;upremacy. To reward her kindne&s;s, they now rai&s;ed two rebellions again&s;t her; and the Pope delivered her and all her adherents to the devil and his angels, and di&s;&s;olved all oaths of allegiance to her or contracts with her. The&s;e things occa&s;ioned a penal &s;tatute again&s;t Papi&s;ts, and requiring them &s;o|lemnly to prote&s;t their innocence to her. But to keep them in countenance, and render the Puritans equally odious, the &s;ame prote&s;tation of allegiance was, without the &s;malle&s;t &s;hadow of rea&s;on, required of them, and the pro&s;ecutions chiefly carried on a|gain&s;t them, which Popi&s;h prie&s;ts by counterfeiting
<PB N="134" REF="138">
them &s;ometimes promoted. By oaths and interro|gations, they made them their own accu&s;ers. And &s;uch was their candour, that they made it a point to deny nothing of the truth, and to declare their principles before their judges. If nothing could be found chargeable upon them, they were ruined by the charges of a dilatory procedure, and then di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed under obligations to appear whenever their judges &s;hould call them.</P>
<P>In 1570, Cartwright, a mo&s;t learned profe&s;&s;or of divinity at Cambridge, extended the field of di&s;puta|tion between the Puritans and their per&s;ecuting bre|thren. In his theological lectures, he, with great mode&s;ty and caution, in&s;inuated, That the names and functions or <HI>archbi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>archdeacons</HI> ought to be aboli&s;hed, as not warranted in &s;cripture; that the &s;cripture only warrants preaching bi&s;hops and deacons, who take care of the poor; that every church ought to be governed by its own mini&s;ter and elders, not by chancellors and officials; that every mini&s;ter ought to have the charge of &s;ome flock; that none &s;hould &s;olicit admi&s;&s;ion to the mini&s;try; that bi&s;hops ought not to be created by the civil ma|gi&s;trate, but cho&s;en by the church; that in reform|ing churches all things ought to be reduced to the a|po&s;tolic pattern; that none incapable of preaching ought to be admitted to the mini&s;try; that none but mini&s;ters can lawfully admini&s;ter the &s;acraments; that Popi&s;h ordination is not valid; that only cano|nical &s;cripture ought to be read in the public wor&s;hip of God; that in public prayer all the people ought to join with the words of the mini&s;ter, and not pray or read each by him&s;elf; that the care of interring the dead pertains not to the mini&s;terial office; that all the words and names of God being equally divine, there is no rea&s;on for <HI>&s;tanding</HI> at the reading of the go&s;pels, or <HI>bowing</HI> at the mention of the name JESUS; that <HI>&s;itting</HI> at the Lord's table is as lawful as kneel|ing or &s;tanding; that bapti&s;m by women or laymen is unlawful; that parents ought to pre&s;ent their own
<PB N="135" REF="139">
children in bapti&s;m, and not be obliged to an&s;wer in name of the child; that women and per&s;ons under age ought not to be allowed to &s;tand &s;pon&s;ors for children; that the &s;ign of the cro&s;s in bapti&s;m is &s;uper&s;titious; that the Lord's &s;upper ought not to be admini&s;tered in private; that the prohibition of marriage at certain &s;ea&s;ons of the year is Popi&s;h, and then to give licences to it for money is intolerable; that clande&s;tine marriages are inconvenient; that the ob&s;ervation of <HI>Lent</HI> and other <HI>holy days</HI> of human ap|pointment is &s;uper&s;titious and unlawful; that mar|kets and merchandize on the Lord's day are unlaw|ful; that in ordination, it is &s;inful and ridiculous for the bi&s;hop to &s;ay, <HI>Receive thou the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> as if he could confer him; and that kings and bi&s;hops ought not to be anointed to their office. For occa|&s;ional hints of this nature, notwith&s;tanding much in|terce&s;&s;ion in his favour, he was deprived of his office, expelled the univer&s;ity; and for two years retired to the Netherlands.</P>
<P>Grindal being tran&s;lated to the archbi&s;hoprick of York, Sandys was made bi&s;hop of London. Per|haps contrary to his convictions, he deprived his old fellow Puritans of the poor remains of indulgence which Grindal had left them, and in&s;i&s;ted for the mo&s;t rigid uniformity. When the parliament met in 1571, in which Strickland and Wentworth were principal &s;peakers, &s;ome relief was intended for the Puritans. Having had the <HI>Thirty-nine articles</HI> pre|&s;ented to them, in order to their legal e&s;tabli&s;hment, they waved the three articles which related to cere|monies and government, and ratified &s;uch only as belonged to doctrinal points, requiring all that po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed eccle&s;ia&s;tical livings to declare their con&s;ent to the&s;e; and &s;uch as &s;hould teach any thing contrary to them, to be deprived. It is probable, that the chu&s;e of 20th article, bearing, That <HI>the church hath power to decree concerning rites and ceremonies of wor|&s;hip, and hath authority in controver&s;ies of faith,</HI> was not in the copy, which they approved; and it is
<PB N="136" REF="140">
certain, their act admitted ordination by pre&s;byters to be valid.</P>
<P>Though it be notoriou&s;ly certain, that but a &s;mall part of the epi&s;copalian clergy did, or do, &s;ub&s;cribe the&s;e articles with hone&s;ty and candour, yet, to di&s;|tre&s;s the Puritans, the convocation, which &s;at dur|ing this parliament, reque&s;ted the bi&s;hops to recall all former licences to preach, and to require not only a &s;ub&s;cription of the articles, but of the <HI>Book of com|mon prayer,</HI> and of the <HI>ordinal</HI> for con&s;ecration of bi|&s;hops, prie&s;ts, and deacons, as containing nothing contrary to the word of God,&mdash;as the condition of every new licence. Contrary to law, this act, tho' never confirmed by the queen, was violently execut|ed by mo&s;t of the bi&s;hops. Meanwhile, contrary to Elizabeth's inclination, the Commons pre&s;ented a petition for &s;upplying a multitude of pari&s;hes de&s;ti|tute of preaching, and for checking abounding pro|fanene&s;s and athei&s;m. The Elector Palatine appoin|ted Zanchy to write to her in behalf of the Puritans. But it &s;eems archbi&s;hop Grindal dur&s;t not deliver his letter. It is certain, that uniformity was more and more urged. Scambler and &s;ome other bi&s;hops, not|with&s;tanding their con&s;ciences were much at her ma|je&s;ty's will, being &s;en&s;ible of the bad con&s;equences of the great want of preaching, and total want of church di&s;cipline, permitted their clergy to enter into a&s;&s;o|ciations or pre&s;byteries, for promoting of both. At Northampton the clergy, the mayor, and the ju&s;ti|ces of peace, agreed upon &s;everal <HI>Rules</HI> for promot|ing Chri&s;tian knowledge, regulating divine &s;ervices, and &s;anctifying the Sabbath. The clergy agreed up|on private exerci&s;es of preaching at their meetings, in order to their mutual improvement in gifts and grace.</P>
<P>Parker &s;till laboured at his per&s;ecuting work. He &s;ent for the principal men of the &s;u&s;pected clergy, and told them, that they mu&s;t take out new licen|ces, in which they mu&s;t &s;ub&s;cribe to all the articles impo&s;ed by the late convocation. The bi&s;hops of
<PB N="137" REF="141">
Ely and Winche&s;ter a&s;&s;i&s;ted him.

friends of his &s;cheme gradually multiplied. They held much the &s;ame doctrine as the church of Eng|land; but they denied her to be a true church, on account of her many corruptions, and renounced all communion with her, and every other church, not of their own model; they placed the whole power of church government equally in all the brotherhood. They cho&s;e and ordained their own officers, and de|prived them of their office at plea&s;ure. Their parti|cular congregations lived as &s;i&s;ter churches; but none had any juri&s;diction over another; nor had their church officers any power of office without the bounds of the congregation in which they were la&s;t cho&s;en and ordained. They hated all pre&s;cribed forms of prayer. Every brother had liberty of prophe&s;ying or exhorting in their religious a&s;&s;emblies. After a &s;er|mon, the brethren ordinarily conferred upon the &s;ubject of it.&mdash;Tyler, Coppington and Hacket, lead|ing Browni&s;ts in England, were impri&s;oned &s;everal years, and the two la&s;t hanged.</P>
<P>About 1582, multitudes of Je&s;uits pouring into England, preached openly again&s;t Elizabeth's title and authority, and di&s;per&s;ed their books. Campian and two others, were apprehended and hanged: but the zeal of the courtiers ran out chiefly again&s;t the Puritans. The remarkably pious Wright was de|prived and impri&s;oned, becau&s;e he had received pre&s;byterial ordination at Antwerp. To extend their oppre&s;&s;ion, Elizabeth employed &s;ome hungry cour|tiers to examine the claims of lands and livings be|longing to the church, and granted every thing, for which church-men could not produce legal titles, to them. By examination of par&s;ons, wardens, and others, they bade fair to find means to &s;eque&s;trate mo&s;t of the church lands for her maje&s;ty's u&s;e. The bi&s;hops were therefore obliged to beg her &s;uper&s;ed|ing of their commi&s;&s;ion. The Suffolk ju&s;tices of peace ventured again to &s;upplicate her indulgence to|ward the Puritans, and complained. That they were reckoned with the vile&s;t malefactors. Some conform

clergy al&s;o wrote in their favour. But Elizabeth, Aylmer, and other court bi&s;hops, who connived at, or encouraged profane &s;wearing, and the mo&s;t open drunkenne&s;s, revelling, and gaming on the Lord's day, panted for their ruin.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding his further &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and remo|val of his &s;eque&s;tration, Grindal continued the object of Elizabeth's di&s;like; and hence lived in a dejected manner till he died in 1585. Whitgift of Worce&s;|ter, who had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his hatred of the Puritans, was placed in his &s;tead. He had &s;carcely received his archbi&s;hoprick, when Elizabeth &s;olemnly charged him to re&s;tore the di&s;cipline of the church, and the e&s;tabli&s;hed uniformity, which had lo&s;t its credit under his predece&s;&s;or. Prepared for obedience, he the very fir&s;t week di&s;patched his man|dates to all the bi&s;hops of his province, That no preaching, catechi&s;ing, or prayer be allowed in fa|milies, in which more than the members are pre&s;ent; that none preach and catechize, unle&s;s he read the whole &s;ervice, and admini&s;ter the &s;acrament four times a year; that all preachers and others in eccle|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ia&s;tical orders wear the pre&s;cribed habits at all times; that none be allowed to preach but &s;uch as have been regularly ordained; that none preach unle&s;s he have taken the oath of &s;upremacy, &s;ub&s;cribed the <HI>Books of common prayer</HI> and of <HI>ordination of bi&s;hops, prie&s;ts and deacons,</HI> and all the <HI>Thirty-nine articles,</HI> and u&s;e &s;aid books in all their mini&s;trations. Several lawyers thought that he exceeded his legal powers, and might have been brought into a <HI>premunire,</HI> for tendering articles, and requiring &s;ub&s;criptions not warranted by parliament. But having her maje&s;ty on his &s;ide, he in&s;i&s;ted on them at plea&s;ure; and for refu&s;ing of them, 233 preachers were &s;u&s;pended in the counties of Norfolk, Suffolk, Su&s;&s;ex, E&s;&s;ex, Kent, and Lin|coln&s;hire, be&s;ides great numbers in London, the dio|ce&s;e of Peterborough, and other counties,&mdash;&s;ome of whom were dignitaries in the church, and mo&s;t of them graduates in the univer&s;ity. Forty-nine of
<PB N="147" REF="151">
them were immediately depo&s;ed from their office. No doubt, multitudes twi&s;ted their con&s;cience to make it &s;ubmit, rather than render them and their families outwardly mi&s;erable. The bulk of the infe|rior clergy, who had any &s;en&s;e, wi&s;hed for amend|ments in the <HI>&s;ervice book,</HI> that the many valuable men thereby di&s;qualified, might be of u&s;e in the church. But Whitgift was deaf to all they could &s;ay, being terrified le&s;t amendments might make people think the church had once been in a mi&s;take.</P>
<P>The ejected clergymen and others that pitied them, pre&s;ented a &s;upplication to the privy council for &s;ome relief in the affair of &s;ub&s;cription. But Whitgift, who, by turning Papi&s;t under queen Mary, had re|tained his place, was firmly re&s;olved to di&s;play his power and execute his fury again&s;t all &s;uch as had not con&s;ciences as flexible as his own. Not content with archi-epi&s;copal juri&s;diction, he be&s;ought her maje&s;ty for the &s;ixth time to erect an <HI>High Commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> who&s;e power might extend to the whole kingdom, and might apply whol&s;ome &s;everities, not becoming bi&s;hops as &s;uch, &s;he readily granted his reque&s;t.&mdash; This court con&s;i&s;ted of 44 members, 12 of which were bi&s;hops, and three a quorum. They had power to call before them all eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es; to exa|mine per&s;ons upon oath concerning their own con|duct; and to &s;u&s;pend, deprive, impri&s;on, or excom|municate them, as they found cau&s;e; and to amend the &s;tatutes of colleges, cathedrals, grammar &s;chools, and other public foundations. They borrowed the examination of men upon oath touching their own principles or conduct, from the Spani&s;h Inqui&s;ition, and their powers were manife&s;tly incon&s;i&s;tent with the laws of the land. But who dur&s;t contradict her maje&s;ty and the archbi&s;hop, who compo&s;ed twenty-four articles directing this court how to examine the Puritans upon oath. Shocked with a &s;ight of them, lord Burleigh wrote to the archbi&s;hop, That they favoured &s;trong of the Romi&s;h Inqui&s;ition, if they were not more en&s;naring. Whitgift returned him
<PB N="148" REF="152">
&s;ome pitiful pretences, in &s;upport of his oath <HI>ex offices.</HI> The privy council repre&s;ented to him and Aylmer, and by naming the per&s;ons, That they connived at plurali&s;ts, non-re&s;idents, and multitudes of ignorant and &s;candalous clergymen, drunkards, whoremon|gers, game&s;ters at cards, and the like, and only ex|erci&s;ed their inqui&s;itorial diligence again&s;t &s;uch as were laborious and diligent preachers. Whitgift attempted to vindicate his conformi&s;ts, while he car|ried on his furious career again&s;t &s;uch as had &s;crupu|lous con&s;ciences. Beale, the clerk of the privy coun|cil, had his own &s;hare of harra&s;&s;ment for expo&s;ing the illegality and inju&s;tice of his inqui&s;itorial proce|dure.</P>
<P>With no &s;mall difficulty, the Puritans obtained a kind of conference on the di&s;puted points between the archbi&s;hop and his brother of Winche&s;ter on the one &s;ide, and Me&s;&s;rs. Sparke and Travers on the o|ther, before the earl of Leice&s;ter, and lords Gray and Wal&s;ingham. They conferred concerning the reading of the <HI>Apocrypha</HI> in&s;tead of the word of God and as equivalent to it;&mdash;the admini&s;tration of bap|ti&s;m in private and by women; the u&s;efulne&s;s of Po|pi&s;h ve&s;tments; the allowance of in&s;ufficient clergy|men, non-re&s;idence, and pluralities. Neither party were &s;atisfied: but the noblemen were &s;o far con|vinced, that they &s;olicited favour for the nonconfor|mi&s;t mini&s;ters. Meanwhile Aylmer pro&s;ecuted them with unrelenting fury. Without the &s;malle&s;t &s;hadow of a crime, and after abu&s;ing them at his bar with the vile&s;t reproaches, he &s;u&s;pended thirty-eight of them in &s;ummer 1584, and afterwards pro&s;ecuted o|thers. Being turned out of their livings and hinder|ed to keep &s;chools, &s;ome of them were reduced to beggary. While Cartwright was correcting a plan of regular di&s;cipline among them&s;elves, which Travers had drawn up about eight years before,&mdash;they applied to the parliament,&mdash;to the convocation, to Whitgift, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and again to the parliament for redre&s;s of their

grievances. In their la&s;t &s;upplication, they &s;hew, that the ten thou&s;and pari&s;hes in England had no more than about two thou&s;and preachers to &s;upply them. On both occa&s;ions, the parliament &s;hewed willingne&s;s to relieve them. But Elizabeth and Whitgift carried all before them; and Wentworth and other, who boldly inveighed again&s;t the bi&s;h|ops arbitrary procedure, were &s;ent pri&s;oners to the Tower.</P>
<P>In 1584, the parliament appeared exceedingly de|&s;irous to grant them liberty;&mdash;to re&s;train the High Commi&s;&s;ion;&mdash;to prohibit pluralities and non-re&s;i|dence of clergymen: and &s;ome bills were pre&s;ented <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur limiting the power of bi&s;hops;&mdash;allowing of per|&s;ons to marry at any time of the year;&mdash;and for the better ob&s;ervation of the Lord's day, which was now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erribly profaned.

years, cruelly per&s;ecuted the &s;cruplers, he died A. D. 1588, declaring in his latter will, That he was, and had alway been per&s;uaded, that the ceremonies were not expedient for the church, but ought to be di&s;u&s;ed by little and little. Much about the &s;ame time, died Fox, Sam&s;on, and Humphreys, noted Puritans.</P>
<P>While the Spaniards were preparing to invade and conquer the kingdom, the Puritans, who had alway di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves for the Prote&s;tant and na|tional intere&s;ts, again &s;upplicated the parliament for relief. But Elizabeth, who was flattered as a <HI>godde&s;s</HI> by the convocation, reprimanded the commons for con&s;idering, whether they &s;hould grant it; and how they might correct the fearful profanation of the Sabbath. When the fears of the Spani&s;h inva&s;ion were over by means of a &s;torm and &s;ea fight, &s;ome le&s;s &s;erious Puritans publi&s;hed &s;ome &s;currilous tracts again&s;t the bi&s;hops, and their procedure and ceremo|nies, under the titles of <HI>Martin Mar Prelate,</HI> &amp;c. which were an&s;wered by churchmen in an equally ludicrous and abu&s;ive manner. At la&s;t the noncon|formi&s;ts pre&s;s was di&s;covered, and Sir Richard Knight|ly and Sir &mdash; Wig&s;ton, who had entertained it, and the Printer, and Newman the di&s;per&s;er, were deeply fined in the Starchamber. Others were put to death, of whom Udal, a pious and learned mini&s;ter, was one, who had no hand in the &s;currilous pamphlets but in a <HI>demon&s;tration of the di&s;cipline of the Chri&s;tian church,</HI> in which the character of the bi&s;hops was thought to be touched; at lea&s;t he acknowledged a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> great part of that book to be true. Notwith&s;tanding much interce&s;&s;ion in his behalf, he was terribly per|&s;ecuted, and condemned as a traitor, without either &s;hadow or proof of his di&s;loyalty, and died in pri&s;on. Meanwhile Whitgift commenced a new vi&s;itation, and framed twenty-two <HI>articles,</HI> on which the war|dens of every pari&s;h were to be examined upon oath, and which were remarkably calculated to di&s;tre&s;s the Puritans, and &s;et every one at odds with his neigh|bour.
<PB N="151" REF="155">
In his letter to Burleigh, Sir Francis Knolles calls them <HI>Articles of Inqui&s;ition</HI> highly prejudicial to the royal prerogative.</P>
<P>The Puritans a&s;&s;ociations for government and di&s;|cipline among them&s;elves expo&s;ed them to further per&s;ecution. Cartwright and fifteen others were apprehended, and impri&s;oned in the Fleet jail.&mdash; Their fir&s;t an&s;wer not being to the ta&s;te of the ma|nagers, they had 31 articles exhibited again&s;t them; and were required, upon oath, to declare how far they were chargeable or not. For having enough of common &s;en&s;e to refu&s;e being &s;elf accu&s;ers, they were puni&s;hed with &s;everal years impri&s;onment.&mdash; James king of Scotland interceeded with Elizabeth, Dr. Goad and Whitaker, noted clergymen, with lord Burleigh, and nine of the impri&s;oned mini&s;ters with Whitgift, for relief. As the archbi&s;hop refu&s;ed to favour them, unle&s;s they renounced their di&s;cipline, and engaged them&s;elves to complete conformity with the church, they applied to her maje&s;ty, and largely vindicated them&s;elves from the reproaches ca&s;t upon them. What effect this application had, I know not; but Cartwright was liberated, and re&s;tored to his ho&s;pital in Warwick, while Fenner, Field, Tra|vers, and many others continued in pri&s;on, and their families were &s;tarving.&mdash;Stone, Perkins, John&s;on, and too many other Puritan clergy, an&s;wered upon oath, and informed their per&s;ecutors of their a&s;&s;em|blies and di&s;cipline, thus purcha&s;ing their own ea&s;e at the hazard of their brethren.&mdash;To render the Pu|ritans odious, Hacket, who imagined him&s;elf to be Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and Coppinger and Arthington his prophets, with every other enthu&s;ia&s;t, were repre|&s;ented as of their number; but Cartwright vindicat|ed them from all connection with &s;uch.</P>
<P>When the parliament met in 1592, Elizabeth no|tified to them, That every thing relative to the church was to be left to her. Attorney Morrice, who had ju&s;t before publi&s;hed <HI>Rea&s;ons again&s;t the oath ex officio,</HI> and proved it contrary to &s;cripture,

Sir Francis Knolle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;econded him. For this pre&s;umption, both of them were bani&s;hed from the court. Morrice was deprived of his chancellor&s;hip in the duchy of Lanca&s;ter, and of all power to act as a lawyer, and was for &s;everal years detained in pri&s;on. Elizabeth told the parlia|ment, That her power over them was ab&s;olute, and &s;he would allow no &s;uch bills to be exhibited. Ter|rified by the &s;ate of Morrice and Knolles, the parlia|ment &s;ubmitted; and to pacify her, enacted, Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> all per&s;ons above &s;ixteen years of age, that refu&s;ed to attend their e&s;tabli&s;hed churches, or who had a|ny hand in promoting nonconformity &s;hould, with|out allowance of bail, be impri&s;oned till they made a proper confe&s;&s;ion of their fault, and engaged to uni|formity; that if they did not &s;o within three months they &s;hould be for ever bani&s;hed the kingdom; and that if they did not leave it within the time pre&s;crib|ed, or did ever return, they &s;hould &s;uffer death without benefit of clergy.

<P>To evade the cruel force of this terrible act, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> moderate Puritans came to church, when the com+mon prayers were over, and received the Lord's &s;up+per in churches, in which &s;ome latitude with re&s;pec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the table po&s;ture, was allowed.

mini&s;ters, all remarkable for piety, were hanged as traitors. But their dying profe&s;&s;ions of their loyalty, and the total want of evidence to the contrary, made their mo&s;t effronted adver&s;aries, even Elizabeth her|&s;elf, almo&s;t a&s;hamed of their groundle&s;s calumny and murder. About &s;eventeen or eighteen other Brow|ni&s;ts died in their pri&s;ons.&mdash;Meanwhile, though the Papi&s;ts had rai&s;ed &s;everal in&s;urrections again&s;t her,&mdash; though they had &s;upported Mary of Scotland's right to her crown, and after her death, that of the In|fanta of Spain,&mdash;and had concurred with the Spani&s;h invaders in 1588, Elizabeth, either from love, or from fear, generally u&s;ed them as her dear children. During the fir&s;t eleven years of her reign, not one of them was capitally pro&s;ecuted. During the next e|leven, notwith&s;tanding the Pope's excommunication above mentioned, and repeated rebellions, no more than twelve prie&s;ts were executed, almo&s;t every one for crimes relating to the &s;tate. For the next ten, not|with&s;tanding multitudes of Je&s;uits laboured to their uttermo&s;t in &s;educing the &s;ubjects to join the Spa|niards, no more than fifty prie&s;ts were executed, and fifty-five bani&s;hed. During the la&s;t twelve years of her reign, they had almo&s;t as much freedom to profe&s;s, practi&s;e, and propagate their idolatries and &s;uper&s;titions, as they could have wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>Till about A. D. 1588, the Engli&s;h Prote&s;tants had all believed, That the &s;uperiority of dioce&s;an bi|&s;hops above pre&s;byters was merely founded on the laws and inclinations of men. Bancroft, now chap|lain to archbi&s;hop Whitgift, to the great offence of the Puritans and others, in a &s;ermon, pled for the <HI>divine right</HI> of it. About 1594, he, Bil&s;on, Bridges, Co&s;ins, and Saravia publi&s;hed their <HI>Defences</HI> of epi&s;|copal powers, and notwith&s;tanding the re&s;traint of the Pre&s;s, were an&s;wered by Brad&s;haw, Fenner, Mortice the attorney, and Beza. The learned, but poor, Hooker publi&s;hed the fir&s;t four books of his <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical polity,</HI> in which he chiefly attempts to prove, That the &s;criptures are not the rule of church

di&s;cipline and government; and that therefore &s;he may appoint whatever forms or ceremonies &s;he judg|eth mo&s;t conducive to edification.&mdash;In 1595, Flet|cher &s;ucceeded Aylmer in the bi&s;hoprick of London. In his fir&s;t vi&s;itation of his dioce&s;e, he &s;et out with twenty &s;even <HI>articles of Enquiry</HI> for church wardens, concerning their preachers, by means of which he quickly repleni&s;hed the pri&s;ons, which, for a little, had been tolerably emptied, with Puritan preachers. It happened well, that his marriage drew upon him Elizabeth's di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of him from his office, and bani&s;hment from the court. The&s;e break|ing his proud heart, he was &s;ucceeded by the &s;till more unmerciful Bancroft.</P>
<P>The learned Ain&s;worth, John&s;on, Smith, Robin|&s;on, and Jacob, principal leaders among the Brown|i&s;ts, having before fled to Holland, multitudes fol|lowed them, and erected churches according to their own plan, at Am&s;terdam, Arnheim, Middleburg, Leyden, and other places.&mdash;About this time, Dr. Bound publi&s;hed a tract on the <HI>due &s;anctification of the Lord's day.</HI> All the Puritans reli&s;hing his &s;entiments, di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their Sabbath behaviour. &mdash;Hereon the cu&s;tomary &s;hooting, fencing, bowling, interludes, and May-games, and Morris-dances on it, began to be di&s;u&s;ed and di&s;liked. This exceed|ingly galled the clerical managers, and their agents, who hated every appearance of &s;trict piety.

<P>Meanwhile, Barret, a fellow of the univer&s;ity o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Cambridge, in a di&s;cour&s;e to the clergy, declared him&s;elf again&s;t the Calvini&s;tical doctrines of prede&s;ti|nation and per&s;everance in grace. The heads of the univer&s;ity obliged him to retract, and Whitgift Hutton of York, and &s;ome others, drew up the <HI>articles of Lambeth,</HI> 'which bear, That God, not mov|ed by any fore&s;een faith or good works of men, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

of his mere good plea&s;ure, hath cho&s;en &s;ome parti|cular per&s;ons to everla&s;ting life; all of whom, and no other, certainly obtain it; that &s;aving grace is not be&s;towed upon all men; that no man can by the power of his free will come to Chri&s;t and be &s;aved; that ju&s;tified per&s;ons have a&s;&s;urance of remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins and of eternal &s;alvation; that true &s;aints never fall totally nor finally from their &s;tate or exerci&s;e of grace. Had not Whitgift and his friends, for their own &s;ake, implored Elizabeth's forbearance, &s;he had brought the formers of the&s;e articles, which &s;he di&s;|liked, or who required the &s;tudents to a&s;&s;ent to them, under the &s;tatute of <HI>premunire.</HI> She was neverthele&s;s highly offended with Dr. Baro, a Frenchman, for con|tinuing the debate in favour of Barret; and at la&s;t obliged him to re&s;ign his profe&s;&s;or&s;hip. The univer|&s;ity of Oxford harmonized in &s;entiment with that of Cambridge, and Calvin's In&s;titutions were publicly read by order of the convocation. About the &s;ame time, the learned Broughton, Bil&s;on, and others, had a warm di&s;pute, Whether Chri&s;t &s;uffered the wrath of God in his &s;oul? and, Whether he de&s;cended to the local hell? After the di&s;putants had fatigued them&s;elves, the controver&s;ies were dropt in both the univer&s;ities.</P>
<P>Towards the latter end of Elizabeth's reign, hopes of approaching redre&s;s from the apparent heir to the crown, &s;omewhat quieted the Puritans. Afraid of having their cruelties returned on their own heads by a Puritan &s;overeign, the ruling clergy delivered over the pro&s;ecuted into the hands of the civil judges, &s;ome of whom handled them in a furious and brutal manner. During her very la&s;t years, the di&s;pute &s;eemed almo&s;t hu&s;hed, and the Puritans increa&s;ed to about fifteen hundred preachers.&mdash;The Popi&s;h mi&s;&s;i|onaries al&s;o, notwith&s;tanding their furious conten|tions between the &s;eculars and the Je&s;uits, laboured with great diligence, and no incon&s;iderable &s;ucce&s;s. &mdash;The parliament which met in 1601, renewed their attacks upon the power of the &s;piritual courts.

But Elizabeth interpo&s;ing, prohibited them to debate the cau&s;e, and referred it to the arch|bi&s;hop, who was at &s;ome pains to render the clerical courts more circum&s;pect.&mdash;At la&s;t &s;he died in 1603. She was extremely haughty, and took a plea&s;ure in manife&s;ting her power and authority, e&s;pecially over the con&s;ciences of her &s;ubjects. She never appears to have &s;truck at any di&s;&s;imulation, which &s;erved her own purpo&s;es. Regard for her own &s;upremacy chief|ly hindered her from being a Papi&s;t. She was not much more mercifully di&s;po&s;ed to Prote&s;tants of a tender con&s;cience, than Mary her &s;i&s;ter. Her im|provement of the great abilities of &s;ome of her &s;tate&s;|men, &s;o as to make their &s;ugge&s;tions &s;eem her own, was the principal ornament of her reign. Pomp and power, not the glory of God, or the welfare of &s;ouls, appear to have been the governing motives of her darling clergy. Many of her ruling bi&s;hops were no le&s;s truly per&s;ecutors, than the Popi&s;h ones under Mary had been. It however grieved them much, that Elizabeth was no friend to the clerical wealth.</P>
<P>JAMES VI. of Scotland, had no &s;ooner &s;uc|ceeded as neare&s;t heir to the crown of England, than all the different parties courted his favour. Whit|gift, and his fellow bi&s;hops, di&s;patched Henry Nevil dean of Canterbury, to a&s;&s;ure him of their unfeigned loyalty,&mdash;and to recommend their church to his care, &mdash;and to beg his command relative to their &s;piritual courts. He returned them an&s;wer, That he intend|ed to &s;upport their government as Elizabeth had left it. The Papi&s;ts welcomed him to England; and put him in mind, that he had been born and baptized a member of their catholic church, which he had cal|led his &s;piritual mother,&mdash;and for who&s;e religion his royal mother had died a martyr. The foreign Pro|te&s;tants had a kind reception, and his promi&s;e of

A|bout eight hundred of their mini&s;ters, out of twen|ty-five counties, pre&s;ented to him that which was called the <HI>Millenary petition,</HI> in which they begged, That the cro&s;s in bapti&s;m, the interrogations put to infants, and their confirmation by bi&s;hops might be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aid a&s;ide; that the u&s;e of the cap and &s;urplice might be no more urged; that per&s;ons &s;hould be examin|ed before admi&s;&s;ion to the Lord's &s;upper; that the u&s;e of the ring in marriage might be omitted; that the <HI>common prayer</HI> might be abridged; that the &s;ing|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng in churches might be modified to better edifica|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion; that the profanation of the Sabbath might be re&s;trained, and the ob&s;ervation of other holy days <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s &s;trictly urged; that none but canonical &s;cripture might be read in the public wor&s;hip of God; that mini&s;ters may not be charged to direct their people <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o bow at mentioning of the name JESUS; that none be admitted to any charge of &s;ouls but &s;uch as are able, and obliged to preach on the Lord's day; that &s;uch pre&s;ent incumbents, as cannot preach, be either removed, or obliged to maintain preachers in their &s;tead; that pluralities and non-re&s;idence be prohi|bited; that clergymen's marriage be declared lawful; and that they be only required to &s;ub&s;cribe the <HI>arti|cles of religion</HI> and the <HI>oath of &s;upremacy;</HI> that bi&s;hops give up their <HI>commendams;</HI> that impropriations an|nexed to bi&s;hopricks and colleges be only be&s;towed upon incumbent preachers; that a &s;ixth or &s;eventh part of the impropriation be a&s;&s;igned for a mainte|nance to the preacher; that no church cen&s;ures be admini&s;tered by mere laymen, chancellors, <HI>&amp;c;</HI> that none be excommunicated for Twelve pence-matters, or without con&s;ent of their pa&s;tor; that eccle&s;ia&s;tical proce&s;&s;es be abridged, and &s;ome Popi&s;h canons abro|gated; that the oath <HI>en officio,</HI> requiring men to be

<P>Stung to the very heart by this reforming petition, and terribly afraid of lo&s;ing their impropriations, the univer&s;ity of Cambridge enacted, That all &s;uch as, in any matter or manner, oppo&s;ed the e&s;tabli&s;hed doctrine or di&s;cipline, &s;hould, <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> be &s;u&s;pend|ed from whatever degrees they had obtained, and be for ever incapable to receive any. The univer&s;ity of Oxford publi&s;hed a vindication of the corruptions complained of in this petition; and tho', exclu&s;ive of Puritans and dignified clergy, not any great num|ber of the incumbents were much removed from gro&s;s ignorance, or even capable of a regular admi&s;&s;ion to the Lord's table, they boa&s;ted, that all the other Prote&s;tant churches could not afford &s;o many learned men as England alone. Other petitions like to the above mentioned were pre&s;ented to his maje&s;ty, and &s;everal papers enforcing them publi&s;hed, to which their opponents quickly returned an&s;wers. The con|formi&s;ts much dreaded the en&s;uing parliament &mdash; Whitgift wi&s;hed rather to account to God for hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> conduct, than to it; and actually died before it met</P>
<P>James heartily hated the&s;e Puritans and their re|formations. But, that he might more plau&s;ibly par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with them, he appointed a conference between them and their opponents at Hampton court, in the mid+dle of January, 1604.

wrong in their &s;ervice book. Bancroft, falling on his knees, begged, that nothing in it might be altered, le&s;t the Papi&s;ts and Puritans &s;hould tri|umph over them, as acknowledging, that they had formerly been in an error. Neverthele&s;s, to &s;atisfy James, they added &s;ome words in the office of <HI>con|firmation</HI> and <HI>ab&s;olution.</HI> And they agreed to con&s;i|der, Whether the admini&s;tration of bapti&s;m &s;hould be re&s;tricted to lawful mini&s;ters and midwives, who were ordinarily known to admini&s;ter it in a due man|ner. On the &s;econd day, the Puritan doctors being admitted, Reynolds was their principal &s;peaker. He in&s;i&s;ted, that &s;ome few words in the <HI>Thirty-nine ar|ticles</HI> might be added, explained, or omitted; that the confirmation of children by the bi&s;hop be con&s;i|dered; that plurality of benefices might be di&s;allow|ed, and preaching mini&s;ters every where &s;ettled; that the reading of the Apocrypha in the public wor|&s;hip of God in&s;tead of his own word,&mdash;the bapti&s;mal interrogation relative to the infant,&mdash;the &s;ign of the cro&s;s in bapti&s;m,&mdash;the &s;uper&s;titious ve&s;tments,&mdash;the &s;ymbolical ring in marriage,&mdash;and the purification of child-bearing women, ought to be aboli&s;hed, becau&s;e relicks of Popery. He al&s;o complained of excom|munications by lay chancellors, and intreated, that clergymen be allowed to meet together every three weeks for their mutual improvement.</P>
<P>During this conference, Bancroft again fell upon his knees, and begged, that &s;chi&s;matics might not be &s;uffered to &s;peak again&s;t their bi&s;hops; and that his maje&s;ty would provide a mini&s;try, which could read prayers and homilies; for they had too much preaching already, in which many dared to vent their malice again&s;t their &s;uperiors. The conformi&s;t di&s;|putants &s;carcely needed to open their mouths.&mdash; Proud of his theological abilities, James, chiefly with hectoring and blu&s;ter, &s;o confounded the Puritan doctors, that even Reynolds, that miracle of learn|ing, &s;unk far below his ordinary dignity, reckoning i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> vain to oppo&s;e the torrent of royal, though often

pitiful, abu&s;e. At the end, James told them, that &s;ince they had no other objections, he would make them conform, or drive them out of his kingdom. To his inconceivable &s;atisfaction, he had his labour extolled by Bancroft and others, as if in wi&s;dom he had almo&s;t exceeded Solomon him&s;elf, and had ne|ver had a royal equal &s;ince our Saviour's birth. On the third day, the conformi&s;ts &s;atisfied him concern|ing the High Commi&s;&s;ion, and the oath <HI>ex officio;</HI> which was the more ea&s;y, as they appeared to be|long to his own prerogative.

<P>In con&s;equence of this conference, a committee was appointed to devi&s;e regulations for le&s;&s;ening the charges of the High Commi&s;&s;ion, and for planting &s;chools, and for &s;ettling proper mini&s;ters in Ireland in which the Popi&s;h party had been lately reduced and on the borders of Scotland and England, wher<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> theft, robbery, and other di&s;orders exceedingly pre|vailed.&mdash;The Puritans refu&s;ed to be concluded by thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mock conference. The di&s;putants on their &s;ide had not been cho&s;en by them, nor thought many thing &s;inful, which their brethren did,&mdash;nay, had refu&s;ed to repre&s;ent the&s;e to his maje&s;ty,&mdash;nor had they been permitted to debate the points which they had men+tioned, in any proper manner.

<P><PB N="161" REF="165">James being naturally fond of ab&s;olute power, the flatteries of his conforming clergy tempted him to exerci&s;e it. Before the parliament met, he, by a proclamation, charged all the Je&s;uits and Popi&s;h prie&s;ts to leave the kingdom; but carefully informed the world, that it was not on account of their reli|gion, but for their maintaining the Pope's power o|ver princes.&mdash;And by another, he commanded all the Puritans to conform immediately, or underly the ex|tremities of law. In his &s;peech to his fir&s;t Engli&s;h parliament, he acknowledged the Popi&s;h to be his mother church, though defiled with &s;ome infirmities and blots, and declared him&s;elf ready to indulge the Popi&s;h clergy, if they but renounced the Pope's &s;u|premacy, and his pretended power to di&s;pen&s;e with the murder of &s;overeigns; and that he would be glad to meet Papi&s;ts half way in order to union; but ea|gerly declared Puritans un&s;upportable in any well governed &s;tate. He moreover informed the parlia|ment of his hereditary right to the crown; and that he was an&s;werable to none but God for his conduct. The parliament quickly perceived, that they had no longer to deal with the &s;agacious and determined Eli|zabeth, and &s;o took their own cour&s;e. To the great vexation of the bi&s;hops, they appointed all proce&s;&s;es in eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts to be wholly i&s;&s;ued in the name of the &s;overeign, and under his &s;eal of array.&mdash;They al&s;o annulled all grants of church lands, which had been made to the crown for twenty years immediate|ly preceding. They legitimated the marriage of cler|gymen, by reviving the act of Edward VI. for that effect; for under Elizabeth their marriages had been merely tolerated, and their children were ba&s;tards in law-reckoning.&mdash;In the convocation, Egerton, Fleet|wood, Wotton, Clark, and other Puritans petitioned for a correction of the <HI>&s;ervice book:</HI> but they and their brethren were commanded to conform before Mid&s;ummer, or underly the cen&s;ures of the church.

<P>In this convocation, the <HI>Book of canons</HI> was approv|ed by the clergy, and was afterward ratified by his maje&s;ty's letters patent.

<P>Bancroft, being advanced to the archbi&s;hoprick of Canterbury, and encouraged by the Lawyers de|ci&s;ion of the king to be ab&s;olute governor of the church, per&s;ecuted the Puritans with &s;uch unrelent|ing rigour, that, burning excepted, they were much about as mi&s;erable as under Mary the bigotted Papi&s;t. Of above 1500 &s;uch preachers, 300 were quickly deprived for &s;crupling to &s;ub&s;cribe the articles of uni|formity,&mdash;&s;ome excommunicated, &s;ome impri&s;oned, and others driven from their country. The king and Starchamber court a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in denying them the common privileges of &s;ubjects &s;ecured by law. By a &s;econd demand of &s;ub&s;cription, Bancroft re|newed his per&s;ecution. So many of the London clergy refu&s;ed to &s;ub&s;cribe again, that a great part of the churches were in danger of being laid de&s;olate for want of preachers,&mdash;had not the prodigious num|bers of &s;cruplers, which now appeared, alarmed the court, and made them, for a time, to relax their pro&s;ecutions.

James, in a few days after, told his parliament, That the Puritans de&s;erved to be burnt for denying the &s;alvation of Papi&s;ts. The parliament enacted, That who&s;oever came not to church, &s;hould pay twelve pence for every Sabbath they were ab&s;ent, unle&s;s they could give a &s;atisfying excu&s;e to the Ju&s;tices of peace. This fell e&s;pecially on the Puritans, as means were u&s;ed for protecting the Papi&s;ts. The Puritan clergy offered a public di&s;putation concerning the lawfulne&s;s of the ceremonies, particularly officiating in the &s;urplice, cro&s;&s;ing in bapti&s;m, and kneeling at the Lord's &s;upper; but it was refu&s;ed them. Here|upon, the&s;e in Lincoln&s;hire drew up an <HI>Apology,</HI> in which they offered to &s;ub&s;cribe to his &s;upremacy; but could not &s;ub&s;cribe their unlimited a&s;&s;ent to the <HI>Book of common prayer</HI> and the <HI>Thirty-nine articles,</HI> as they thought &s;ome things in them contrary to the word of God.

<P>In 1620, the congregation of Robin&s;on, a pious and moderate Browni&s;t, at Leyden, being on the de|cline, thro' the death of old members, and marriage of the young into Dutch families, they re&s;olved to re|move to &s;ome part of America, under the protection of England, where they might pre&s;erve their religion.

<P>Buckeridge, Har&s;net, Neile, and Laud, having embraced the Arminian errors,&mdash;by their flattering of James in his notions and practice of arbitrary go|vernment, made him their hearty friend, and were advanced to &s;ome of his principal bi&s;hopricks.

When the parliament met in 1621
<PB N="169" REF="173">
the Commons drew up a large Remon&s;trance, in which they complained of the danger of the Prote|&s;tant religion from the increa&s;e of Papi&s;ts, their nu|merous conventicles, the remi&s;&s;ion of the fines im|po&s;ed on them by law, the education of many chil|dren of rank in Popi&s;h &s;eminaries abroad, and the &s;pread of Popi&s;h books; and they be&s;ought his maje|&s;ty to a&s;&s;i&s;t his &s;on-in-law, in recovering his Electo|rate; and to break off all attempts toward a marriage of his &s;on Charles with the Spani&s;h Infanta, and marry him to &s;ome Prote&s;tant prince&s;s.

<P>Having thus got rid of his trouble&s;ome hou&s;es of parliament, he commanded the Popi&s;h pri&s;oners to be liberated. About four thou&s;and Je&s;uits and others obtained their relea&s;e. Informed of this, multitudes of Je&s;uits and other Papi&s;ts flocked into England.&mdash; Ma&s;s was openly celebrated in the country. In Lon|don, their private meetings were &s;o crowded, that in 1622, the floor &s;unk under one of them, and kil|led the preacher, and about 93 others. Meanwhile, the e&s;tabli&s;hed pulpits were carefully filled with zea|lots for arbitrary power; and &s;uch as dared to a&s;&s;ert the rights of the &s;ubjects, were puni&s;hed. Mr. Knight, having, in a &s;ermon before the univer&s;ity of Oxford, taught, That &s;ubordinate magi&s;trates may defend them&s;elves again&s;t their &s;overeign, if he become a tyrant, and attempt to force their compliance with idolatry or bla&s;phemy.

Now, their faithful adherence to what they had been re|quired to &s;ub&s;cribe in the <HI>Thirty-nine articles,</HI> con|trary to Arminiani&s;m, rendered them offenders, and excluded them from preferment. Nay, in many places, bi&s;hops and their officials re&s;tricted preachers to the expre&s;s words of the <HI>Catechi&s;m,</HI> in their after|noon work.</P>
<P>Having, to his inexpre&s;&s;ible grief, accidentally killed a man in hunting, archbi&s;hop Abbot with|drew him&s;elf from the privy council, in which his advice had been little regarded, on account of his tenderne&s;s to pious and con&s;cientious &s;cruplers.&mdash; Having lo&s;t their friend, many of the&s;e Puritans re|tired to America, and Popery came in like a flood. To promote the marriage of Charles with the Spa|ni&s;h Infanta, it was agreed, That &s;he, and all her &s;ervant, children, and de&s;cendents, &s;hould have li|berty

He and his &s;on &s;wore al&s;o to &s;ome private articles, That there &s;hould be no future execution of the laws again&s;t Papi&s;ts, nor any new ones made; that there &s;hould be a perpetual tolera|tion of the Popi&s;h religion in private hou&s;es; that the Infanta &s;hould never be &s;olicited to change her religion; that they &s;hould deal with the parliament to re&s;cind the laws again&s;t Papi&s;ts.&mdash;Charles further &s;wore, That he would deal with his father to allow the Infanta to have the education of her children till they were <HI>twelve</HI> years of age; and that he would diligently hearken to &s;uch prie&s;ts as &s;he would em|ploy to confer with him on points of religion. The Papi&s;ts began to triumph, and the Prote&s;tants to tremble. Archbi&s;hop Abbot, by a letter, earne&s;tly remon&s;trated again&s;t the match. After all, James &s;olemnly called God to witne&s;s, that he &s;incerely dete&s;ted Popery, and that the increa&s;e of it was a heavy burden on his &s;oul. Meanwhile, his parliament pre&s;ented him with a li&s;t of 57 Popi&s;h lords and knights in office, while &s;carcely any that was but &s;u&s;pected of Puritani&s;m could be admitted to be a Ju&s;tice of peace. And, after fini&s;hing the French match for his &s;on, he allowed ten thou&s;and Papi&s;ts to be confirmed at the French amba&s;&s;ador's lodging.</P>
<P>In 1625, James died, not without &s;u&s;picion of poi&s;on. He was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome learning, deeply

During his reign, Papi&s;ts, but e&s;pecially the Puritans, exceedingly in|crea&s;ed, while the high churchmen, by their igno|rance, error, and impiety, became the dete&s;tation of all &s;ober Prote&s;tants.

Bent on reconciling the Popi&s;h and Prote&s;tant faith, James' new bi&s;hops were almo&s;t perfectly &s;imilar. They maintained the Romi&s;h to be a true church, and the Pope the principal bi&s;hop in Chri&s;tendom; they contended for the lawfulne&s;s of images in churches; and for the real pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t in the &s;acrament; and that tran&s;ub&s;tantiation was but a &s;chola&s;tic nice|ty; they pled for auricular confe&s;&s;ion, and prie&s;tly ab&s;olution, and the merit of good works: they gave up with the morality of the Chri&s;tian Sabbath: they claimed an uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the epi&s;copal character from the apo&s;tles: they were mad on the imitating of Papi&s;ts in rich furniture of chapels and gawdy pomp of wor&s;hip. While they flamed with zeal in compromi&s;ing matters with Rome, they were notoriou&s;ly negligent of in&s;tructing their people in the truths of God. Almo&s;t every practical writer of note, as Willat, Dyke, Pre&s;ton, Sibbs, Byfield, Bolton, Hilder&s;ham, Dod, Ball, Whatley, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were Puritans.</P>
<P>CHARLES I. a&s;cended his throne, a hearty enemy to the Puritans, looking on them as a kind of &s;editious and treacherous per&s;ons, who would take their fir&s;t opportunity of revolting from the tempo|ral juri&s;diction, as they had done from the &s;piritual. His queen, whom he almo&s;t adored, was a bigotted French Papi&s;t, and had the education of her children

&s;ecured to her till they &s;hould be <HI>thirteen</HI> years of age. Her con&s;cience was directed by her Confe&s;&s;or, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Pope's nuncio, and a &s;ecret cabal of Je&s;uits and prie&s;ts. Bi&s;hop Laud was of a rough temper, prone to &s;everities, e&s;pecially again&s;t the Paritans, impatient of contradiction, very arbitrary and &s;uper&s;titious; and though not an ab&s;olute Pa|pi&s;t, extremely fond of near approaches to Popery, and of being Patriarch of Britain and Ireland. The privy council and the Starchamber, in which the &s;ame per&s;ons were members, and the High Commi&s;|&s;ion managed almo&s;t every thing. In &s;ome re&s;pects the la&s;t was wor&s;e than the Spani&s;h Inqui&s;ition, as they puni&s;hed people without any breach of law.&mdash; Arminiani&s;m daily gained ground with all &s;uch as coveted preferment. Laud had attempted to have it approved by the convocation, had not bi&s;hop An|drews per&s;uaded him, that it was too &s;oon to put it to the trial.</P>
<P>Henrietta, the Popi&s;h queen, had &s;carcely arrived in England, when a plague followed her, and cut off above forty thou&s;and in London and places about. A &s;olemn fa&s;t was appointed, to &s;upplicate God for the removal of it. When the parliament met, the Commons earne&s;tly remon&s;trated again&s;t the increa&s;e of Popery, and the &s;everal cau&s;es of it; and begged, that the preaching of God's word might be increa&s;ed, and the labours of pious, peaceable, and learned &s;cruplers at the ceremonies u&s;ed;&mdash;and that plurali|ties, non-re&s;idences, and commendams might be mo|derated. Charles promi&s;ed, in the faire&s;t manner. But be had already begun to believe, that no faith is to be kept with parliaments. Upon the very day after he had wrote to archbi&s;hop Abbot, to proceed again&s;t the Papi&s;ts, and had, by a proclamation, re|quired all Engli&s;h youth to be recalled from the Po|pi&s;h &s;eminaries abroad, he appointed eleven Popi&s;h prie&s;ts to be liberated. Fifty-nine Popi&s;h nobility and gentry were in places of power and tru&s;t. The titular bi&s;hop of Chalcedon was appointed the Pope's

<P>Montague, one of his maje&s;ty's chaplains, publi|&s;hed his <HI>Gag for an old goo&s;e;</HI> which contained &s;eve|ral principles calculated to di&s;turb the church or &s;tate.

<P>Neverthele&s;s, Montague's Arminian errors were refuted from the pre&s;s by bi&s;hop Carleton, doctors Sutliff, Featly, and Goad, and Me&s;&s;rs.

Laud and his friends having the management in their hands, turned the edge of this proclamation wholly again&s;t the Puritans. They could not have their books printed, if they contained any thing again&s;t Arminiani&s;m or Popery, while their opponents were allowed full liberty, and had no &s;mall encouragement. Archbi&s;hop Abbot was &s;u&s;pended from his office, for refu&s;ing to concur in betraying the liberties of church and &s;tate into his maje&s;ty's hand, and for his Chri&s;tian moderation towards &s;uch as &s;crupled at the ceremonies, or even the government of the church. And for much the &s;ame rea&s;on, Williams bi&s;hop of Lincoln fell under the di&s;plea&s;ure of the court. But Montague, Sibthorp, and Manwaring, Arminian &s;tretchers of the royal prerogative, were care&s;&s;ed and preferred. When the parliament met in 1628, they again remon&s;trated again&s;t the increa&s;e of Pope|ry in England and Ireland, in which la&s;t, Papi&s;ts had boldly refu&s;ed to concur in the defence of the king|dom, unle&s;s they were allowed a legal toleration, and to have hou&s;es for religious wor&s;hip in Dublin, and other places. But &s;o impudent, in uttering fal&s;hood, were Charles and Laud, that they pretended all the&s;e clamours about Arminiani&s;m and Popery to be groundle&s;s.</P>

Being men of a remarkably holy practice, &s;trict ob&s;ervers of the Lord's day, warm preachers, and &s;taunch Calvini&s;ts, Laud accounted them the great plagues of church and &s;tate.

<P><PB N="179" REF="181">The per&s;ecutors vented their fury on as many as they could.

He was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed upon his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, but never more favoured at court. Mr. Leighton, a Scotch divine, and father to the bi&s;hop of that name, for &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t bi&s;hops, canons, ceremonies, and a Popi&s;h queen, in his <HI>Zion's plea again&s;t Prelacy,</HI> was condemned to pri&s;on for life, fined in ten thou|&s;and pounds &s;terling, and to be whipt, and after that fixed on the pillory at We&s;tmin&s;ter, have one ear cut off, and &s;ide of his no&s;e &s;lit up, and his face branded with <HI>S S.</HI> to mark him a <HI>Sower</HI> of <HI>Sedition;</HI> and after a few days, to be again whipt and pilloried at Cheap&s;ide, and have the other ear cut off, and &s;ide of his no&s;e &s;lit.

<P>The church of <HI>St. Catherine Creed,</HI> London, be|ing lately repaired, was &s;u&s;pended from divine &s;er|vice till it &s;hould be again con&s;ecrated.

When the cathedral churches of London, Canterbury, Durham, and the chapel of Lambeth, were repaired, the Popi&s;h ornaments, images of di|vine per&s;ons not excepted, were carefully pre&s;erved, and new ones were procured, to render the places more comely and &s;acred. As the Puritans inveighed again&s;t the&s;e Popi&s;h fooleries or wickedne&s;s, the High Commi&s;&s;ion took care to puni&s;h them for their pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>In 1631, Laud, being made chancellor of the uni|ver&s;ity of Oxford, expelled &s;everal of the fellows for preaching or teaching anti-arminian doctrine, and appointed others to be &s;harply admoni&s;hed. For his &s;ingular appearances of piety, and for preaching twice every Lord's day, Mr. Crowder was depo&s;ed and impri&s;oned by the High Commi&s;&s;ion.&mdash;About four years before, Drs. Gouge, Sibbs, and other cler|gymen, had formed a &s;cheme to buy up all the ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical impropriations, that were in the hands of laymen, and not in the &s;ervice of the church, in or|der to be&s;tow the profits thereof as &s;alaries upon faithful and diligent preachers. Pretending, that they chiefly be&s;towed them upon Puritans, Laud got them &s;tripped of all that they had bought, and &s;ined to boot. For &s;peaking again&s;t images in churches, Hayden, a workman, was &s;courged, impri&s;oned, and forced to live on bread and water; and two mini&s;ters were &s;u&s;pended and excommunicated. Sherfield, a ju&s;tice of peace, having under&s;tood that &s;ome igno|rant people religiou&s;ly bowed to &s;even images of God the Father, in the form of a little old man, in a blue and red coat, working at the creation of the world, in the painted gla&s;s windows of the old church of Sali&s;bury, did, with con&s;ent of the wardens, take out the&s;e panes, and put new ones in their room. For this he was deprived of his recorder&s;hip, &s;ined in 500 pounds &s;terling, and committed to clo&s;e pri|&s;on, till he paid it. Meanwhile, Laud in&s;pected the
<PB N="182" REF="184">
Pre&s;s, and expunged out of every book, for which licence was granted, every pa&s;&s;age, which di&s;allowed of religious pictures, or of erecting, bowing, or pray|ing to images. Becau&s;e the Engli&s;h churches in Holland and Hamburgh refu&s;ed to conform to his ceremonies, he harra&s;&s;ed the foreign Prote&s;tants in England. He had &s;carcely returned from a&s;&s;i&s;ting his maje&s;ty to promote conformity in Scotland, 1633, when he was made archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, in&s;tead of the now decea&s;ed, but long ago di&s;graced and hated Abbot; and in Charles' name remitted ARTI|CLES for the royal chapel at Edinburgh, to be a pattern to the re&s;t that kingdom.</P>
<P>Great complaints having been pre&s;ented to Lord Chief Ju&s;tice Richard&s;on and Baron Denham, in their we&s;tern circuit, of manifold mi&s;chiefs ari&s;ing from revels, church-ales, clerk-ales, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">N.

In their <HI>Clerk ales,</HI> they drank at the clerk's hou&s;e, that by the profit of his ale, and their compliments, they might help his &s;mall &s;ala|ry. <HI>Bid ales</HI> were drinking matches for &s;etting up people, who had lo&s;t their &s;ub&s;tance. Their behaviour at the&s;e Sabbath meetings was much the &s;ame as at our penny wed|dings, drinking matches, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> upon the Lord's day,&mdash;conform to many precedents under Eli|zabeth and James, and even one of 1629, they made an order for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing them, and required every mini&s;ter to read it on three different Sabbaths every year, before Ea&s;ter; and at their return puni&s;hed &s;ome who had been guilty of di&s;obedience. Laud, having complained of their invading the rights of bi|&s;hops, they were cited before the privy council, &s;harply reprimanded, and required to recall their injunctions. Pierce, bi&s;hop of Bath and Wells, in|formed Laud, how much the people di&s;liked the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of their Sabbath revels; and what ble&s;&s;ed means they were of bringing people to church, and
<PB N="183" REF="185">
of promoting mutual affection. Seventy-two of his clergy &s;igned this information. Meanwhile, the ju&s;tices of the county repre&s;ented the&s;e meetings as a remarkable &s;ource of profanation of the Sabbath, riotous tippling, contempt of authority, quarrels, murders, whoredom, and very prejudicial to the peace, plenty, or order of the country; and there|fore begged, that they might be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. No le&s;s zealous for &s;upporting and encouraging them, Laud cau&s;ed Charles to re-publi&s;h his father's <HI>Book of &s;ports,</HI> adding a particular allowance of the revels above mentioned, along with an order to all the bi|&s;hops to &s;ee that it &s;hould be read from every pulpit in the &s;everal pari&s;h churches of the kingdom, that all the &s;ubjects might know what liberties were al|lowed them. Laud thought the Puritans would refu&s;e to read it from their pulpits on Sabbath, and &s;o expo&s;e them&s;elves to pro&s;ecutions, while his fa&s;hi|onable clergy, who reckoned the Sabbath of no more than eccle&s;ia&s;tical appointment, and no more but the time of public wor&s;hip holy, would readily read it.</P>
<P>While the courtiers held their balls, ma&s;querades, interludes, and plays on the Lord's day, and the country people, e&s;pecially the youth, their revels, dances, wakes, May-games, church-ales, clerk-ales, bid-ales, and other recreations,&mdash;many hundreds of the pious clergy were pro&s;ecuted before the High Commi&s;&s;ion, &s;u&s;pended, deprived, excommunicated, and forced to leave the kingdom, for refu&s;ing to read this <HI>Book of &s;ports.</HI> Laud and his party reckoned murder, adultery, and the like, almo&s;t no crimes in re&s;pect of this. To render the <HI>Book of common prayer</HI> more agreeable to the Papi&s;ts, and more di&s;tre&s;sful to the Puritans, Laud, at his own hand, made &s;ome alterations in it. In the collect for the royal family, Elizabeth of the Palatinate and her di&s;tre&s;&s;ed family were expunged. The prayer again&s;t the Papi&s;ts for the 5th of November was turned again&s;t the Puri|tans. An order was given to turn the communion
<PB N="184" REF="186">
tables into altars, and to compa&s;s them about with rails. Bowing at the name of Je&s;us was perempto|rily required. Dreadful was the ferment which the&s;e alterations occa&s;ioned, particularly that which re|lated to the communion table. Many mini&s;ters and church wardens were fined and excommunicated, be|cau&s;e they &s;crupled to obey.</P>
<P>Prynne, a noted lawyer, having publi&s;hed a book again&s;t &s;tage plays, ma&s;querades, and dancing, it was ordered to be publicly burnt by the hands of the hangman. He was deprived of his degrees in Lin|coln's-inn and the univer&s;ity of Oxford: he was pil|loried at We&s;tmin&s;ter and Cheap&s;ide, at each of which places he had one of his ears cut off. He was fined in five thou&s;and pounds, and committed to perpetual impri&s;onment. Dr. Ba&s;twick, a phy&s;ician, having publi&s;hed a tract again&s;t the Romi&s;h bi&s;hops, in which he had denied the divine warrant for the &s;uperiority of bi&s;hops above pre&s;byters, he was deprived of his office, excommunicated, fined in a thou&s;and pounds, and condemned to ly in pri&s;on till he &s;hould recant. Burton, a mini&s;ter, was impri&s;oned for &s;everal years, becau&s;e, in his publi&s;hed &s;ermons, he had dropt &s;ome hints again&s;t Laud's innovations.&mdash;While the terrible procedure of the High Commi&s;&s;ion forced Elliot, Cotton, Davenport, Hooker, Shepherd, and Nor|ton, all of them remarkable Puritan mini&s;ters, to &s;lee into New England, Laud, having become chan|cellor of the univer&s;ity of Dublin, and having lord deputy Wentworth, afterward earl of Strafford, on his &s;ide, he excluded the Puritan articles which arch|bi&s;hop U&s;her had e&s;tabli&s;hed in Ireland, and intro|duced the <HI>Thirty-nine</HI> Engli&s;h articles in their &s;tead, &mdash;denouncing an excommunication again&s;t all &s;uch as &s;hould affirm any of them to be &s;uperfluous or erro|neous. The Dutch and French Prote&s;tants in Eng|land, con&s;i&s;ting of ten congregations, and about 6000 communicants, had their pa&s;tors &s;u&s;pended, and their churches &s;hut up, becau&s;e they would not agree that their children in the 2d de&s;cent, &s;hould be bound to

conformity. Many of the&s;e foreigners left the king|dom, to the great hurt of the manufactures, and the poor employed in them. The Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at Paris, was prohibited to attend public wor&s;hip with the French Prote&s;tants, but got a chapel of his own furni&s;hed to the liking of Laud, who declared, that he did not look upon the Hugonots as a part of the Engli&s;h's brethren in Chri&s;t. Provoked with the&s;e things, few of the foreign Prote&s;tants pitied the Eng|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;h Epi&s;copalians in their &s;ub&s;equent di&s;tre&s;s. Soli|cited by his &s;i&s;ter Elizabeth, Charles granted a Brief for a general collection through England, for the Prote&s;tant mini&s;ters of the Palatinate, which had been &s;ubdued and terribly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the Popi&s;h troops of the emperor. But Laud prevented its &s;uc|e&s;s, by excepting, that in the Brief Papi&s;ts were called Antichri&s;tians, and the religion of the Palatine Prote&s;tants &s;aid to be the &s;ame with that of the church of England.</P>
<P>In &s;ummer A. D. 1635, Laud performed his me|tropolitical vi&s;itation; and had his &s;pies every where, that no precentor, or even private per&s;on, was &s;afe to &s;peak in public companies, or even conver&s;e with his neighbours. Terrible were the pro&s;ecutions rai&s;|ed for neglecting to change communion tables into <HI>altars,</HI> or for other di&s;conformities to his injuncti|ons. Many broke up hou&s;e-keeping, intending to go to America. Informed of their de&s;ign, the coun|cil prohibited all but &s;oldiers, mariners, merchants, and factors to leave the kingdom without a pa&s;&s;port from his maje&s;ty. Notwith&s;tanding this re&s;traint, Peter Bulkly and Richard Math<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">ious clergymen, and many others, got off.&mdash;To <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">vance eccle&s;ia&s;tical power, Laud drew much of the bu&s;ine&s;s of We&s;tmin|&s;ter hall into the &s;piritual courts, which the king al|lowed him to hold in name of the bi&s;hops. Being allowed a right to vi&s;it the univer&s;ities, he drew up a &s;y&s;tem of new &s;tatutes for that of Oxford, in the preface to which he &s;everely reflected on the di&s;or|dering government of Edward VI. and extolled the

reign of Mary, as producing a revival of di&s;cipline and making the univer&s;ity to flouri&s;h,&mdash;candour through the much de&s;ired felicity of the times, &s;up+plying the place of &s;tatutes.

The mar&s;hal of the king's bench came upon about eighty of them a&s;&s;embled toge|ther, and threw the mo&s;t of them into pri&s;on.&mdash; Next morning, five or &s;ix of them were carried be|fore the Hou&s;e of Lords, to whom they hone&s;tly de|clared, That they could own no other Head of the church than Chri&s;t; that no laws contrary to the&s;e of God ought to be obeyed; and they di&s;owned the juri&s;diction of the Pope and every other foreigner. Such a declaration, a few weeks or months before, would have co&s;t them their ears: but now, the Lords di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them with a gentle reprimand; and three or four of them went to their meeting next Sabbath, and were not a little &s;atisfied with their order in preaching and admini&s;tering the Lord's &s;upper.</P>
<P>Though the Commons could not yet rectify the old <HI>canon law,</HI> which had long been an unfathomable &s;ource of oppre&s;&s;ion in the &s;piritual courts, they vot|ed down the late innovations, and appointed com|mi&s;&s;ioners in all counties, to demoli&s;h and remove out of churches and chapels all images, crucifixes, &s;uper&s;titious pictures, and other relicks of idolatry, according to the injunctions of Edward and Elizabeth. They prohibited the impo&s;ing of the <HI>oath of unifor|mity</HI> upon the &s;tudents of Cambridge and Oxford, at their matriculation. They made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to cut off illegal additions from the wor&s;hip, di&s;cipline, and government of the church, and to puni&s;h &s;uch as had promoted the introduction of them, contrary to the laws of the land.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="197">The freedom which the Commons u&s;ed with the bi&s;hops and their canons, awakened the attention of the whole nation. The Pre&s;s being now open, &s;e|veral pamphlets, not in the mo&s;t decent language, were publi&s;hed again&s;t the&s;e dioce&s;an lords and their office. Archbi&s;hop U&s;her applied him&s;elf to defend the epi&s;copal order as apo&s;tolical: but by BISHOP be meant no more than a &s;tated pre&s;ident over pre&s;|byters,&mdash;which mo&s;t of the Puritans were willing to admit. His half Pre&s;byterian &s;cheme was far enough from plea&s;ing his brethren. About a year before, bi&s;hop Hall, directed by Laud, had publi&s;hed a <HI>de|fence of hierarchical Epi&s;copacy,</HI> in which he attempt|ed to prove, That it was an apo&s;tolical in&s;titution, and of perpetual obligation; that as the pious Chri&s;|tian Fathers would not change the form of church government which they had received from the apo|&s;tles, the univer&s;al practice of the primitive church, is the be&s;t rule of judging concerning the apo&s;tolical practice; and that pre&s;byterian government, having no foundation in the word of God, or in the prac|tice of the Chri&s;tian church for 1500 years, is alto|gether unju&s;tifiable. As Laud, in revi&s;ing it, had altered &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages, Hall could &s;carcely go the length of his own book. Neverthele&s;s, he now pu|bli&s;hed a <HI>Remon&s;trance</HI> to the parliament, and &s;oon after a defence of it in vindication of liturgies and dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy. His performances were an&s;wer|ed by Me&s;&s;rs. Stephen Mar&s;hal, Edmund Calamy, Thomas Young, Matthew Newcomb, and William Spur&s;tow, in their SMECTYMNUS, &s;o called from the initial letters of their name, in which they &s;hew|ed, That the &s;cripture no where re&s;tricts men to &s;et forms of prayer; that for 300 years after Chri&s;t, there were no &s;et forms of prayer impo&s;ed by the church; and defy the bi&s;hop to produce one genu|ine liturgy within that time. They &s;hewed, that the Engli&s;h liturgy is extracted from Popi&s;h models, and in many places offen&s;ive to tender Chri&s;tians; that bi&s;hops and pre&s;byters are repre&s;ented as the &s;ame in
<PB N="196" REF="198">
office in &s;cripture; that both &s;cripture and the anti|ent church allowed pre&s;byters to ordain pa&s;tors with|out bi&s;hops, as archbi&s;hop U&s;her and all the Engli&s;h bi&s;hops for many years after the Reformation, thought they might; and that, for 400 years after Chri&s;t, bi&s;hops had no chancellories or commi&s;&s;aries. They &s;hewed manife&s;t differences between the bi&s;hops of the 3d and 4th century, and the dioce&s;ans in Eng|land. They concluded, be&s;eeching the parliament to reduce Epi&s;copacy to its primitive &s;implicity, if they retained it, and that the liturgy might be re|formed, if they continued it, and not at all impo&s;ed, but left to preachers di&s;cretion, how much of it &s;hould be read, where there was &s;ermon. Had all the other bi&s;hops been as pious and moderate as Hall, with all his high flights, matters had readily been compromi&s;ed. But the courtiers were too proud to &s;toop an hair breadth to their opponents; and &s;o, to the great &s;atisfaction of the Papi&s;ts, the contenti|ons increa&s;ed till both church and &s;tate were in flames.</P>
<P>The fate of the hierarchy being now in the hands of the parliament, petitions &s;ub&s;cribed by multitudes, for, or again&s;t it, were pre&s;ented to both Hou&s;es. Some, as that called the <HI>root and branch Petition,</HI> &s;ub&s;cribed by 15,000 citizens, and other inhabitants of London, craved, that the whole fabric of Epi&s;co|pacy might be demoli&s;hed. Another, &s;ub&s;cribed by 1700 beneficed clergymen, only in&s;i&s;ted for the refor|mation of it; in which they were joined by great multitudes in othet repre&s;entations. Nineteen pe|titions &s;igned in whole by about an hundred thou|&s;and, &s;ix thou&s;and of whom were noblemen, gentry, and dignified clergy, in&s;i&s;ted for the continuance of the e&s;tabli&s;hment, as it had &s;tood &s;ince the Refor|mation. The&s;e different petitions furni&s;hed the Commons with a large field of elaborate debates.&mdash; Sir Henry Vane younger, Thomas Bag&s;haw, and White, in&s;i&s;ted for the total aboli&s;hment of the hierarchy. Lords Falkland and Digby, the mo&s;t noted of the royali&s;ts, in&s;i&s;ted for the continuance

and reformation of it, repre&s;enting the pre&s;ent bi&s;h|ops and their agents, as a &s;et of infernal oppre&s;&s;ors, who had tried how much of the Papi&s;t they could bring in without Popery, and how much of the go&s;|pel they could de&s;troy, without expo&s;ing them&s;elves to puni&s;hment by the civil law. As the Papi&s;ts who flocked about the court, being protected by the queen, &s;ometimes in&s;ulted the courts of judicature, the Commons be&s;ought his maje&s;ty to i&s;&s;ue forth a pro|clamation for executing the laws again&s;t Papi&s;ts in ge|neral, and to remove them from his court; and all &s;uch as refu&s;ed the oath of &s;upremacy from the army and garri&s;on, and to di&s;arm their whole body, as their number was become dangerous to the nation, there being about 6000 of them in one pari&s;h of We&s;tmin&s;ter. The&s;e addre&s;&s;es did but provoke the Papi&s;ts, the king and queen being determined to protect them as long as they could. Charles even reprived Goodman, a &s;eminary prie&s;t under &s;entence of death in Newgate,&mdash;which occa&s;ioned warm re|mon&s;trances from both Hou&s;es of parliament.</P>
<P>In 1641, Wentworth, now earl of Strafford, who had once been a mo&s;t zealous a&s;&s;erter of the rights of the &s;ubjects, was attainted of high trea&s;on for endeavouring to &s;ubvert the government in England and Ireland, and to introduce arbitrary power of kings. Charles countenanced a plot to draw the army to London, and re&s;cue him by force. This but enraged the parliament, and made his con|demnation the more harmonious. Even Falkland and Digby, who oppo&s;ed his attainder, repre&s;ented him as a mo&s;t in&s;upportable tyrant. His conduct, as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, too &s;trongly verified it. With great reluctance, Charles &s;igned his &s;en|tence of death, and perhaps not till him&s;elf had hy|pocritically de&s;ired him to do it for the peace of the kingdom. A de&s;ign of Charles' di&s;&s;olving the par|liament taking air, the citizens of London declared, that they would lend no money upon the parliament's &s;ecurity, if their &s;itting were &s;o precarious. Money
<PB N="198" REF="200">
being immediately needed to pay off the Scotch and Engli&s;h armies in the North, Charles was obliged to ratify an act, bearing, that the parliament &s;hould neither be di&s;&s;olved nor adjourned without their own con&s;ent. Alarmed by the di&s;covery of a Popi&s;h plot again&s;t them, and the flight of the con&s;pirators, both Hou&s;es, bi&s;hops not excepted, entered into a &s;olemn covenant, in the pre&s;ence of Almighty God, to main|tain with life, power, and e&s;tate, as far as they law|fully might, the Prote&s;tant religion, again&s;t Papi&s;ts and Popi&s;h innovations,&mdash;and his maje&s;ty's per&s;on, honour, and e&s;tate, and the privileges of the parlia|ment, and rights and liberties ef the nation, and of every one concurring in this prote&s;tation, in every thing they do in pro&s;ecution of it;&mdash;and by all pro|per methods to endeavour to bring to condign pu|ni&s;hment all that act contrary to the contents of it; &mdash;and by all ju&s;t and honourable methods, labour to pre&s;erve the union and peace between the kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland;&mdash;and that nei|ther fear, hope, or any other motive, &s;hould make them relinqui&s;h this vow, promi&s;e, and prote&s;tation. This was &s;ub&s;cribed by eighty lords, &s;eventeen bi&s;h|ops, nine judges, and four hundred and thirty-eight members of the Hou&s;e of Commons; and it was im|mediately printed, and &s;ent to all the &s;heriffs and ju&s;tices, to be taken by the whole nation, the mini|&s;ter reading and taking it him&s;elf, and then tho&s;e of his congregation: the names of &s;uch as took or re|fu&s;ed it, being entered in different regi&s;ters, the Commons &s;oon after voted the refu&s;ers of it unfit to bear office either in church or &s;tate. This prote&s;ta|tion, except what relates to the hierarchy, is mate|rially the &s;ame with the <HI>Solemn League.</HI></P>
<P>The Commons next attempted to exclude the bi|&s;hops from their &s;eat in parliament, and to aboli&s;h <HI>deans, chapters, archdeacons, prebendaries, chantors canons,</HI> and their officers, and to be&s;tow their &s;alaries in &s;upporting preachers for the in&s;truction of the people. But both bills were lo&s;t in the Hou&s;e o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="199" REF="201">
Lords. Meanwhile, the&s;e peers had appointed ten earls, ten bi&s;hops, and ten barons, to examine what innovations needed to be removed. The&s;e appointed a &s;ub-committee of bi&s;hops and divines on both &s;ides. Several rectifications were propo&s;ed in the doctrine, wor&s;hip, and di&s;cipline. Williams of Lincoln, who was chairman or moderator, pre&s;ented a plan for re|gulating the power and conduct of bi&s;hops, but which almo&s;t nothing dimini&s;hed their power. Archbi&s;hop U&s;her, who was then occa&s;ionally in England, offered another, bearing, That vicars and church wardens &s;hould have much the &s;ame power as pre&s;byterial &s;e&s;&s;ions; &s;uffragans and their clergy &s;hould meet e|very month in the manner of Pre&s;byteries; bi&s;hops and their clergy once or twice a year in the manner of Synods; archbi&s;hops, bi&s;hops, and &s;uffragans, to|gether with duly cho&s;en repre&s;entatives of the infe|rior clergy, once in three years in provincial Synod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; &mdash;and both meet in one national Synod when the parliament &s;hould &s;it. This &s;cheme was much the &s;ame with the Pre&s;byterian, except that the bi&s;hops or their &s;uffragans were con&s;tant moderators. But, when it appeared, that the bi&s;hops &s;tuck together in the parliament again&s;t all alterations, the committee broke up without agreeing on any plan. This &s;tiff|ne&s;s of the bi&s;hops provoked their oppo&s;ers to ri&s;e in their demands. Meanwhile, the High Commi&s;&s;ion and Starchamber courts being aboli&s;hed, and an act pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t their future erection, the Puritans de|clared their zeal for a Manife&s;to, which Charles &s;, he intended for the meeting of the German princes at Rati&s;bon, in favour of his &s;i&s;ter Elizabeth, queen of Bohemia, and her children, bearing, That he in|tended to do his utmo&s;t to have them re&s;tored to their electorate.</P>
<P>Baffled in their former attempts to reduce the power of the bi&s;hops, the Commons impeached Laud and other twelve of them, of high crimes and mi&s;|demeanors,&mdash;for making and publi&s;hing the late <HI>ca|nons,</HI> contrary to his maje&s;ty's prerogative and the
<PB N="200" REF="202">
fundamental laws of the land, the rights of parlia|ment, and liberties of the &s;ubjects. They did not re&s;ign their &s;eats as was expected, but craved time to prepare an&s;wers. As Charles intended to &s;et off for Scotland to compleat the <HI>Pacification</HI> with that king|dom, the <HI>Treaty</HI> between the two nations, and <HI>Act of oblivion,</HI> excepting the Scotch bi&s;hops and four o|thers, were ratified and confirmed. In this Treaty, an endeavouring after an union and uniformity in religion and church government with the Scots, was approved by his maje&s;ty and his hou&s;es of parliament: and on the <HI>national Thank&s;giving</HI> for the peace, the Scots, who had a little before been declared <HI>rebels,</HI> were, by order of parliament, declared <HI>good &s;ubjects</HI> from all the pulpits in England.&mdash;Scarcely had he returned from Scotland, when the Engli&s;h bi&s;hops &s;everely reproached him for con&s;enting to the aboli&s;h|ment of Prelacy, and ratification of Pre&s;bytery in that kingdom. This, together with his con&s;enting to the condemnation of Strafford, lay heavy on his heart.&mdash;Complaints of want of &s;ermon in churches being pre&s;ented to the Commons, they appointed afternoon &s;ermons in every church, either by the vi|car, or &s;ome other cho&s;en by the pari&s;h in his room; and that people may, at their own charge, &s;et up lecturers to preach on Sabbaths or other days, where &s;ermon is wanting. Forty members were appointed as a committee to provide preachers and &s;alaries for vacant congregations, and another committee to ex|amine complaints again&s;t &s;candalous clergymen, ma|ny of which had been pre&s;ented. They al&s;o appoin|ted, that the Lord's day &s;hould be more carefully &s;anc|tified, and no &s;ports be allowed on it; that all images of divine per&s;ons, or virgin Mary, &s;hould be aboli&s;hed; and <HI>bowing</HI> at the name of Je&s;us, or towards the Ea&s;t, or the communion table, laid a&s;ide. As archbi&s;hop Laud, in his pri&s;on, &s;till pre&s;umed to ordain clergy|men, the Lords &s;u&s;pended him from his office, and &s;eque&s;trated his juri&s;diction in the hand of inferior officers, till he &s;hould clear him&s;elf from his charge.
<PB N="201" REF="203">
Notwith&s;tanding all their zeal for reformation, the Commons &s;everely puni&s;hed &s;uch as pretended to promote it in a tumultuous manner, or dared to preach without orders.</P>
<P>The earl of Antrim and Sir Phelim O'Neal, heads of the Popi&s;h party in Ireland, having acquainted the queen, the nuncio and prie&s;ts about her, how ea&s;ily they could a&s;&s;ume the Iri&s;h government, and a&s;&s;i&s;t his maje&s;ty again&s;t the Engli&s;h Puritans, &s;he and Charles by letters authorized them to &s;eize the government. They immediately took arms, and bound them&s;elves by oath to maintain the catholic religion, and bear true and faithful allegiance to the king's maje&s;ty and his laws, and defend them with their lives and e&s;tates, again&s;t all opponents. They called them&s;elves the <HI>Queen's army,</HI> and publi&s;hed a declaration, bearing, That they acted by his maje|&s;ty's commi&s;&s;ion under the Great Seal, and a letter written by him&s;elf. Having a&s;&s;embled, to the num|ber of twenty or thirty thou&s;and, they judged it pro|per fir&s;t to ma&s;&s;acre all the Prote&s;tants in Ireland, that they might afterwards with &s;afety march again&s;t the Engli&s;h or Scots, as his maje&s;ty or queen direct|ed. Regardle&s;s of relation, neighbourhood, or hu|manity, they ma&s;&s;acred about two hundred thou&s;and of them in cold blood, and in the mo&s;t barbarous forms. Notwith&s;tanding all the pains taken to con|ceal and deny it, it now plainly appears from the ac|counts given by Burnet, Birch, and lately publi&s;hed papers of Clarendon, that Charles him&s;elf, as well as the queen and nuncio, were deeply chargeable with this blood&s;hed, though it is probable their agents overdid their orders. The news of this ma&s;&s;acre &s;truck the Engli&s;h with the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation; and the parliament devi&s;ed methods for &s;ecuring them&s;elves and nation again&s;t the Papi&s;ts, and for tran&s;porting an army to Ireland for the relief of the poor remains of their Prote&s;tant brethren.

<P>As the Lords appeared to favour the bi&s;hops, and to &s;hift off their trial, the people renewed their &s;up|plications to the Commons, whom they reckoned the &s;upport of religion and liberty. The mayor and al|dermen of London pre&s;ented a petition, craving, that for the promoting of reformation, the bi&s;hops and Popi&s;h lords might be removed from the Hou&s;e of Peers. Soon after, the apprentices petitioned, That the Popi&s;h lords and other noted per&s;ons of that re|ligion might be taken into cu&s;tody, and Prelacy root|ed out. The Puritan clergy be&s;ought the parliament &s;peedily to rectify that which they found ami&s;s in the church. Meanwhile, two petitions were pre&s;ented in favours of Prelacy as the only government of apo|&s;tolical in&s;titution, &s;ealed with the blood of martyrs, and admirably &s;uited to the civil government of the nation. About the time the apprentices pre&s;ented their petition, &s;ome began to in&s;ult the bi&s;hops, as they went to, or returned from the Parliament-hou&s;e.

harmony, aboli&s;hed that form of Epi&s;copacy which was e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Engli&s;h laws. But as this act only appointed it to cea&s;e about a year after, and pro|vided nothing in its place, it is probable that &s;ome of the Engli&s;h managers hoped, before that time, to ob|tain peace with his maje&s;ty, and &s;o retain Epi&s;copacy with &s;ome modifications. And, indeed, the whole pertinents of Prelacy were never aboli&s;hed till after he was reduced.</P>
<P>About this time, an uncommon &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and devotion prevailed among tho&s;e that lived in places, to which the power of the parliament chiefly exten|ded. The Sabbath was &s;anctified with unu&s;ual &s;trict|ne&s;s; the churches were crowded with attentive hea|rers three or four times a day; the officers of the peace walked in the &s;treets, and &s;hut up all public hou&s;es; nor did any travel on roads, or walk in fields, but in ca&s;e of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity. Religious exerci&s;es were &s;o univer&s;ally &s;et up in private families, that at certain hours, one might have traver&s;ed the &s;treets of London, without &s;eeing one idle per&s;on, or hear|ing any thing but the &s;ound of prayers and prai&s;es from churches and hou&s;es. The parliament prohi|bited &s;tage plays, as too often expre&s;&s;ive of levity and wantonne&s;s,&mdash;and other diver&s;ions, as not &s;uited to their afflicted circum&s;tances. They commanded the monthly fa&s;ts, which had been appointed about a year before, with his maje&s;ty's con&s;ent, for bewailing the deplorable ciroum&s;tances of Ireland, to be exact|ly ob&s;erved. Morning exerci&s;es were &s;et up in chur|ches to pray for per&s;ons in the army or otherwi&s;e in danger, and to admini&s;ter proper exhortations.&mdash; Morning lectures were &s;et up for the benefit of mem|bers of parliament. The laws again&s;t vice were &s;o &s;trictly executed, that no &s;tews or gaming hou&s;es were to be found; nor was profane &s;wearing, or like debauchery to be &s;een or heard in the &s;treets. The like appearances of religion prevailed in the parlia|ment's army, the mo&s;t of their &s;oldiers not &s;o much fighting for pay as for religion and liberty; and they
<PB N="206" REF="208">
had the mo&s;t noted preachers for chaplains to their regiments. Meanwhile, mo&s;t of his maje&s;ty's parti|zans and warriors were remarkably profligate, ready to take every &s;ober per&s;on for a Puritan, and to plun|der him on that account,&mdash;by means of which not a few were induced, or forced, into the parliament's &s;ide. Many of his preachers knew little more of their bu&s;ine&s;s than to rail at the Puritans and their doctrines of God's free grace.</P>
<P>In 1643, after a &s;olemn fa&s;t, in which they and the nation bewailed their own and father's iniquities, the parliament warmly reque&s;ted his maje&s;ty, That the laws &s;hould be &s;trictly executed again&s;t the Pa|pi&s;ts; and that they &s;hould be obliged to abjure the Pope's &s;upremacy, tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, purgatory, and wor&s;hip of images,&mdash;and their children trained up in the Prote&s;tant religion; and that he would give his a&s;&s;ent to the five acts which they had made,&mdash;for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing innovations in God's wor&s;hip; for &s;trict ob&s;ervation of the Lord's day;&mdash;for the aboli&s;hment of Prelacy;&mdash;for the puni&s;hment of &s;candalous cler|gymen;&mdash;for the re&s;traint of pluralities of church livings with charge of &s;ouls, and non-re&s;idences of clergymen at their charges;&mdash;and for calling an a&s;|&s;embly of learned divines to advi&s;e them in &s;ettling the government and liturgy of the church. But he was far enough from any hone&s;t compliance with &s;uch demands.</P>
<P>The clergy of both &s;ides had peculiar hard&s;hips to endure from both &s;ides. Charles' partizans had hanged up &s;ome of the Puritan clergy, if the parlia|ment had not threatened to make repri&s;als. The committee, which the parliament appointed to purge out &s;candalous clergymen, was obliged to &s;ub-divide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it&s;elf, on account of the va&s;t extent of their work. Shocking di&s;coveries were made in the lives of not a few of the conforming clergy. Many in&s;ulted the committees and their witne&s;&s;es, and threatened re|pri&s;als. Notwith&s;tanding the ejection of multitudes for their &s;candals, not a few, &s;carcely tolerable in
<PB N="207" REF="209">
their practice, were allowed to retain their charges. The parliament &s;upplied the place of the ejected the be&s;t way they could. Two congregations were &s;ome|times committed to one pa&s;tor, and &s;ome that were too weak were admitted to others. Meanwhile, they &s;eized the bi&s;hops lands, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in carrying on their war with his maje&s;ty, allowing con&s;iderable pen&s;ions to &s;uch of them as had been more decent and le&s;s wicked. They proceeded in appointing or|gans and monuments of &s;uper&s;tition and idolatry to be removed from places of public wor&s;hip. Be&s;ides their monthly fa&s;ts on Wedne&s;days, which Charles and his friends ob&s;erved on holy Fridays, they ap|pointed &s;everal occa&s;ional fa&s;ts on account of their di&s;tre&s;sful circum&s;tances. The war between the dif|ferent parties being carried on from the Pre&s;s with almo&s;t as much fury as in the field, the parliament prohibited the printing of any book, which was not licen&s;ed by &s;uch as they appointed for that work,&mdash; different licen&s;ers being allotted to the different &s;ci|ences to which books pertained.</P>
<P>De&s;pairing of Charles' concurrence with them in calling an A&s;&s;embly of divines, the parliament by them&s;elves called one, not to be an independent ju|dicatory of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but a committee for advi&s;ing them in religious matters proper to be con&s;idered and e&s;tabli&s;hed by civil authority. Having had li&s;ts of the be&s;t qualified per&s;ons in the &s;everal counties tran|&s;mitted to them by knights and burge&s;&s;es, they &s;e|lected an hundred and twenty-one divines, to which they added ten Lords and twenty Commoners, with equal power of debating and voting. When any of the&s;e died, the parliament cho&s;e his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. Me&s;t. Alexander Hender&s;on, George Gille&s;py, Samuel Ru|therfoord, and Robert Bailie, mini&s;ters, lord Mait|land, the earl of Lowdon, and Archibald John&s;ton, afterward lord Warri&s;ton, ruling elders, commi&s;&s;io|ners from the Scotch General A&s;&s;embly, were, not without &s;ome reluctance, admitted as members. No more than about ninety-&s;ix of the Engli&s;h divines
<PB N="208" REF="210">
gave any proper attendance. Archbi&s;hop U&s;her, bi&s;hop Brownrig, Henry Hammond, John Hacket, George Morley, Robert Sander&s;on, and William Ni|col&s;on, the four la&s;t of whom after the re&s;toration were bi&s;hops of Litchfield, Winche&s;ter, Lincoln, and Glouce&s;ter, never took their &s;eats. Though the parliament had appointed Epi&s;copalians, as well as Pre&s;byterians and Independents, members, few of the fir&s;t kind ever took their &s;eats, and tho&s;e that did, quickly withdrew, when Charles prohibited their meeting, becau&s;e the members had not been cho&s;en by the clergy, and many of them were either laymen or Puritans. They that continued in it were gene|rally men of eminent piety, learning, and faithful|ne&s;s to God and their country. Their meeting was opened July 1, with a &s;ermon by Dr. Twi&s;&s;e their prolocutor or moderator. They agreed upon a &s;o|lemn vow, to be taken by every member at his ad|mi&s;&s;ion, <HI>That he &s;hould maintain no doctrine, but what he believed mo&s;t agreeable to the word of God; and no|thing in points of di&s;cipline, but what he believed to be conducive to the glory of God, and the peace and wel|fare of his church.</HI> This their &s;olemn vow or oath was read to them every Monday morning, to render it deep and fre&s;h in their minds. After fixing the order of their procedure, they petitioned the parlia|ment to appoint a <HI>&s;olemn fa&s;t</HI> for divine direction in their important bu&s;ine&s;s; and that they would take &s;till more effectual methods for rooting out the igno|rance, profanation of the Sabbath, profane &s;wearing, cur&s;ing, drunkenne&s;s, and uncleanne&s;s &s;till found in the land; that they would &s;peedily purge out igno|rant and &s;candalous clergymen, and &s;ub&s;titute pro|per mini&s;ters in their &s;tead;&mdash;that they would exert them&s;elves for the relief of tho&s;e mini&s;ters, whom his maje&s;ty's party retained in di&s;tre&s;sful impri&s;on|ment at Oxford. A committee of the A&s;&s;embly was appointed to revi&s;e the <HI>Thirty-nine articles,</HI> and render them more plain and pointed, particularly in oppo&s;i|tion to Arminiani&s;m. But, after a review of <HI>fifteen
<PB N="209" REF="211">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rticles,</HI> this was dropt, and it was re&s;olved to draw up a more full <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith.</HI> To mark their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eal again&s;t Antinomiani&s;m, they condemned &s;ome notions of Cri&s;p, Eaton, and Saltmar&s;h, and labour|ed, &s;ometimes <HI>not very circum&s;pectly,</HI> to confute them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n their &s;ermons and writings.</P>
<P>The parliament's affairs being reduced to a low ebb, they deputied the earl of Rutland, Sir Henry Vane, and Me&s;&s;rs. Stephen Mar&s;hal, and Philip Nye, and three others, to negotiate with the Scotch Con|vention of E&s;tates and General A&s;&s;embly for &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance in this critical hour. The A&s;&s;embly con&s;i|dering, That the Engli&s;h had befriended them in their di&s;tre&s;s; and that the Prote&s;tant religion in Britain was in danger; and that by this means their own religion might be the better &s;ecured, and an uniformity with their Engli&s;h brethren promoted,&mdash; earne&s;tly advi&s;ed to grant their reque&s;t on proper terms. A draught of a <HI>&s;olemn league</HI> with one an|other, and <HI>covenant</HI> with God, approved by the Scotch A&s;&s;embly and Convention of E&s;tates, being brought up to London, the parliament referred it to the A&s;&s;embly of divines, where it met with no &s;mall oppo&s;ition. Gataker and others refu&s;ed to &s;ub&s;cribe it, till they got that which related to Prelacy &s;o cir|cum&s;cribed, as, in their view, not to exclude arch|bi&s;hop U&s;her's &s;cheme of primitive Epi&s;copacy. The Scotch divines in&s;i&s;ted to have Prelacy abjured as &s;in|ful. But mo&s;t of the Engli&s;h oppo&s;ed this: the In|dependents, Era&s;tians, and half Epi&s;copalians thought that the words <HI>according to the word of God,</HI> &s;ufficient|ly protected them again&s;t the inroads of Scotch Pre&s;|bytery; and the Scots thought the following words, <HI>according to the practice of the be&s;t reformed churches,</HI> nece&s;&s;arily meant their own government and di&s;ci|pline. When Coleman, the noted Era&s;tian, read it to the Lords, in order to their &s;wearing and &s;ub|&s;cribing it, he openly declared, that by abjuring <HI>Prelacy,</HI> they did not abjure all kinds of Epi&s;copacy, but only that kind particularly de&s;cribed in this oath.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="212">After this covenant had been &s;worn by both Hou|&s;es of parliament, the A&s;&s;embly of divines, and the inhabitants of London, the parliament appointed it to be taken by the re&s;t of the nation above eighteen years of age, and tran&s;mitted along with it an exhor|tation by the A&s;&s;embly to take it,&mdash;and directions re|gulating the manner of doing it. Great numbers took it chearfully, and with a good con&s;cience. O|thers did &s;o, becau&s;e the parliament and their cir|cum&s;tances required it. When it was impo&s;ed upon the Engli&s;h in Holland, the Elector Palatine of the Rhine, and who afterward &s;at for a time with the We&s;tmin&s;ter A&s;&s;embly, took it. Not long after|ward, the parliament enacted, That none &s;hould be coun&s;ellors in burghs, or have the power of electing one, unle&s;s they took it. Mini&s;ters were required to take it at their ordination. None were to be conti|nued in tru&s;t, civil or military, who ob&s;tinately re|fu&s;ed it. The&s;e mandates of the parliament were not very punctually executed. Richard Baxter and &s;ome other Puritan mini&s;ters much prevented the impo&s;i|tion of this covenant in the corners where they re&s;i|ded. At Oxford and many other places, it was little urged, unle&s;s upon &s;uch as were &s;u&s;pected, or rather well known, to favour the king's party, and not &s;o properly as a religious vow, as an oath of obedience to the parliament. After the war, it was impo&s;ed on the royali&s;ts with much the &s;ame intent.</P>
<P>The committee for purging out &s;candalous mini|&s;ters, &s;ometimes made u&s;e of the covenant for di&s;co|vering malignant clergymen,&mdash;which occa&s;ioned a report, That they were turned out for refu&s;ing it.

This alienated the earls of Holland, Bedford, Clare, and Carli&s;le,&mdash;Sir Henry Deering, and others of his be&s;t friends from him, as they &s;aw him regardle&s;s of the welfare of his kingdom. The parliament ordered the A&s;&s;embly to inform the &s;o|reign Prote&s;tants of his artifices, and of the tokens of his di&s;regard of the Prote&s;tant religion, notwith&s;tan|ding his &s;olemn declarations of attachment to it.&mdash; Charles pur&s;ued their repre&s;entation at the heels with a contrary declaration.

<P>In 1644, Charles held a &s;mall parliament at Ox|ford, while the majority of the Peers, and three hun|dred and eighty of the Commons adhered to the par|liament. But their propo&s;als were too pacific to plea&s;e him. Meanwhile, twenty-one thou&s;and Scots having entered England for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the par|liament at We&s;tmin&s;ter took heart, and re&s;olved to proceed in their intended reformation, and to e&s;ta|bli&s;h a new Form of di&s;cipline and government.

of accommodation. A treaty was for a time pro&s;e|cuted at Uxbridge, in which there was perhaps too little &s;incerity on either &s;ide, and each &s;u&s;pected the other. Charles profe&s;&s;ed chiefly to &s;cruple at allow|ing or e&s;tabli&s;hing of any other form of wor&s;hip or government than had been long u&s;ed. To enlighten his con&s;cience, Me&s;&s;rs. A. Hender&s;on of Edinburgh, S. Mar&s;hal and R. Vines held a &s;olemn conference before him, with Dr. Stewart and others of his par|ty, concerning Epi&s;copacy and its attendent ceremo|nies. Neither party appeared convinced by their op|ponents. But Charles, perhaps without any inten|tion of performance, promi&s;ed that he would admit of the reduction of Prelacy, almo&s;t to archbi&s;hop U|&s;her's plan. Before the Scots came to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, the parliament would have been glad of his offer; but now they would accept of nothing le&s;s than the compleat aboli&s;hment of Prelacy.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the work of the A&s;&s;embly proceeded but &s;lowly, on account of the different parties in it, each of which had their &s;upporters in parliament.&mdash; The Pre&s;byterians were the mo&s;t numerous, having the Scotch divines and London mini&s;ters for their principals, and Denzil, Hollis, W. Waller, Philip Stapleton, J. Clotworthy, B. Rudyard,&mdash;Maynard Ma&s;&s;ey, Harley, Glyn, and &s;ome others, for their chief &s;upporters in the Hou&s;e of Commons. Selden, Whitlock, Lightfoot, Coleman, and &s;ome others, like the Engli&s;h reformers and other Era&s;tians, belie|ved the government and di&s;cipline of the church to depend on the will of the magi&s;trate,&mdash;and had St. John, Widdrington, Crew, Hip&s;ley, and others, to &s;upport them in parliament. Thom. Goodwin, Ph. Nye, Syd. Sim&s;on, Jer. Burroughs, and W.

<P>As the bi&s;hops refu&s;ed to ordain the candidates, that were not in the king's intere&s;t, the A&s;&s;embly con&s;idered how &s;uch might be ordained before they had fini&s;hed their Directory.

Ten of the members, with thirteen others, &s;even of whom were a <HI>quorum,</HI> were appointed by the parliament for that purpo&s;e.

<P>When the A&s;&s;embly entered upon the government of the church, both Pre&s;byterians and Independents heartily agreed again&s;t the Era&s;tians, That <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t had fixed a particular form of government</HI> in his New Te&s;tament church. But when they proceeded to enquire, What that particular form of church government was? and, Whether it was perpetually binding? the Pre&s;byterians had hard &s;truggling with the Independents on the one hand, and the Era&s;tians on the other. The Era&s;tians were content to allow Pre&s;byterian government to be <HI>mo&s;t agreeable to the word of God,</HI> and mo&s;t proper to be &s;ettled in Eng|land; but they warmly oppo&s;ed the <HI>divine right</HI> of it. &mdash;For fifteen days, the Independents combatted the divine appointment of Pre&s;bytery, and for as many more contended for the divine right of their own form of church government.

Pierced with grief, that the Era&s;ti|ans had carried this point again&s;t them, the Scotch commi&s;&s;ioners and other Pre&s;byterians in&s;tigated the council, and afterward the mini&s;ters, of London, to be&s;eech the Commons to e&s;tabli&s;h Pre&s;byterian go|vernment, as the government of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. This drew the frowns of the Hou&s;e upon the &s;upplicants.

Finding it un&s;afe to enter the city, he fir&s;t directed his cour&s;e toward the &s;ea, as if he had intended to leave this country, and then turning northward, he to their a&s;toni&s;hment, threw him&s;elf into the Scotc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> army at Newca&s;tle, without previou&s;ly acquainting them. On his fir&s;t arrival, he &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to+ward peace with his parliament; and on May 18th 1646, wrote them to that effect, and a&s;&s;ured them that he had recalled all commi&s;&s;ions granted by hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for making war on his &s;ubjects, and had ordered th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

di&s;banding of all his forces; and that he cordially intended to join with his parliament in e&s;tabli&s;hing religion according to the advice of his Engli&s;h and Scotch Parliaments. But &s;ome Epi&s;copalian bigots, getting acce&s;s to him, he changed his mind. The Scotch army and their Committee of E&s;tates at Edin|burgh be&s;eeching him to &s;atisfy his Engli&s;h parlia|ment concerning religion, as without his doing it, they could not, according to their con&s;cience or co|venant, protect him again&s;t them; and indeed they could not have attempted to do it, without ruining their own country,&mdash;Charles profe&s;&s;ed his willingne&s;s to confer with any, whom they &s;hould appoint, con|cerning the lawfulne&s;s of aboli&s;hing Prelacy, and e|&s;tabli&s;hing Pre&s;bytery, contrary to his coronation oath. Mr. A. Hender&s;on was brought from Edin|burgh for that purpo&s;e. But Charles had been &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iutoxicated with the divine right of Prelacy, the &s;u|perlative excellence of the <HI>Book of common prayer,</HI> the uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of bi&s;hops from the apo&s;tles, the right of the antient Chri&s;tian doctors to be judges in controver&s;ies, and the &s;tandard of interpreting &s;cripture; princes &s;ole right to reform any thing in religion, and the unlawfulne&s;s of &s;ubjects, on any account, taking arms again&s;t their king, that Mr. Hender&s;on's nervous rea&s;oning had no effect upon him. His pretences of regard to his coronation oath, after he had &s;pent the fir&s;t fifteen years of his reign in a perpetual violation of it, marked him determined to receive no conviction.</P>
<P>While the parliament having, by new acts, rooted up the foundations of Prelacy; declared it for ever aboli&s;hed; appointed the bi&s;hops lands and privile|ges to be &s;old for defraying the expences of the war, and &s;upporting preaching clergymen,&mdash;they in&s;i&s;ted with Charles, as the condition of peace, that he would ratify their deeds for the reformation of religion.&mdash; Notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t importunate intreaties of his tru&s;ty and &s;en&s;ible friends, he &s;till refu&s;ed, and in&s;i&s;ted, that at lea&s;t bi&s;hops &s;hould be retained in

his quarters, the dioce&s;es of Oxford, Winche&s;ter, Bath, Wells, and Exeter. He in&s;i&s;ted with the Scotch army to protect him. But, as neither their church nor &s;tate would hear of his coming to Scot|land on his own terms, and they could not retain him in England without an immediate war with the parliament's forces, they &s;urrendered him up to the Engli&s;h parliament, without either a&s;king or receiv|ing a &s;ingle farthing on that account.</P>
<P>In 1647, the Engli&s;h Lords and many others, in|tended, whenever the Scots marched home, to di&s;|patch a con&s;iderable body of their own troops to act again&s;t the Papi&s;ts and their royal confederates in Ireland, and to retain at home no more than were nece&s;&s;ary for the peace of the country, and to have the&s;e commanded by per&s;ons well affected to their covenanted reformation, by which means they hoped to treat with more advantage with his maje&s;ty. The Scotch army, who, on this con&s;ideration, ha&s;tened their departure, were &s;carcely at home, when the Engli&s;h parliament made an ordinance for the &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion of here&s;y and &s;chi&s;m, and appointed a &s;olemn fa&s;t for bewailing their increa&s;e. They enacted, That no member of the hou&s;e, nor any who did not take the covenant, &s;hould command in the army or in garri&s;ons, nor any drunkard, &s;wearer, or other|wi&s;e &s;candalous per&s;on; and that ten thou&s;and and &s;ix hundred foot forces &s;hould be &s;ent to Ireland, and 5,300 hor&s;e; and the &s;oldiers in garri&s;ons be retain|ed at home, and all the re&s;t di&s;banded on the 2d of June en&s;uing. In con&s;equence of the&s;e things, Char|les &s;ent them more &s;atisfactory an&s;wers to their pro|po&s;itions.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the above acts of parliament, the &s;ectaries more and more increa&s;ed. In the army, there were &s;till many &s;ober and &s;erious: but things were ha&s;tening into a chaos of confu&s;ion in religion. The officers became fiery di&s;putants, and often &s;up|plied the place of mini&s;ters to the regiments, and of|ficiated in the pulpits where they were quartered&punc;

But he is too keen to de&s;erve intire credit.&mdash; And indeed, &s;uch was the di&s;order and licentiou&s;ne&s;s in religion, that it was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to reduce them to either &s;ects or opinions. We hear of <HI>En|thu&s;ia&s;ts, Ranters, Seekers,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. many of which died in their infancy, or joined with the&s;e afterward called <HI>Quakers.</HI> It is &s;aid, that about an hundred Popi&s;h clergy were &s;ent from abroad, to join the different parties, in order to increa&s;e and inflame the confu&s;ions.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith,</HI> which the Scotch divines had in&s;i&s;ted for, in&s;tead of the <HI>Thir-nine articles,</HI> was fini&s;hed, not without di&s;&s;ents rela|tive to the <HI>imputation of Chri&s;t's active obedience, church government and di&s;cipline, liberty of con&s;cience,</HI>&mdash;and, along with the &s;cripture proofs, tran&s;mitted to the parliament in May 1647, and, after about thirteen months, and many long debates, the mo&s;t part of it was approved by both Hou&s;es. The 30th chapter, which relates to church cen&s;ures; that part of the 31&s;t, which relates to the calling and power of Sy|nods; great part of the 24th concerning marriage and divorce; and that part of the 20th concerning the puni&s;hment of &s;uch as vent opinions de&s;tructive to the peace of the church, were referred to further con&s;ideration, and at la&s;t laid a&s;ide. After the <HI>Con|fe&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Catechi&s;ms</HI> were fini&s;hed, the Scotch com|mi&s;&s;ioners went home, and the remaining part of the A&s;&s;embly did almo&s;t nothing, but examine candidates for the mini&s;try, and di&s;pute concerning the divine right of Presbyterian government. After &s;itting five years, and almo&s;t &s;even months, and hold|ing 1163 &s;ederunts, they intirely di&s;&s;olved Febru|ary 22, 1649.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time before their di&s;&s;olution, the ma|nagement of eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters was in the hands of the Provincial Synod of London, which met at
<PB N="226" REF="228">
Zion college twice every week in 1648, and all the twelve following years, when they could. At the end of every &s;ix months, the members were changed, and the Synod renewed. The fir&s;t having little op|portunity of &s;itting, did little be&s;ides agreeing upon &s;ome rules of order. The &s;econd publi&s;hed a &s;olemn <HI>Te&s;timony</HI> again&s;t the errors of the times, in which they declare their adherence to the Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, and their abhorrence of the following tenets, That the &s;criptures of the Old and New Te&s;tament are not of divine authority, nor the only rule of faith; that God hath a bodily &s;hape, and is the principal author of &s;in; that there is no Trinity of per&s;ons in the Godhead; that Chri&s;t is inferior to the Father, and the Holy Gho&s;t but a mini&s;tring Spirit; that God hath equally elected all men to everla&s;ting life; that no man eternally peri&s;heth for Adam's fir&s;t &s;in; that Chri&s;t died for all mankind, and the benefit of his death is intended by God for all; that every man hath a free will and power in him&s;elf to repent, obey the go&s;pel, and do every thing nece&s;&s;ary for his eter|nal &s;alvation; that faith is not a &s;upernatural grace; that faithful actions are the only ground of our ju&s;ti|fication before God; that the moral law is not a rule of life to believers; that believers are as pure from &s;in as Chri&s;t, and &s;o need not pray for the pardon of it; that God &s;eeth no &s;in in his people, nor cha&s;ti&s;|eth them for it; that there ought to be no churches, &s;acraments, or Sabbaths; that bapti&s;m ought not to be continued among Chri&s;tians, nor the infants of believers baptized; that for&s;wearing of one's &s;elf is the whole meaning of the 3d commandment; that brethren and &s;i&s;ters may lawfully marry together, and divorces be founded upon indi&s;po&s;ition, unfit|ne&s;s, or contrariety of tempers; that human &s;ouls are mortal; and there is neither heaven nor hell till the day of judgment. They te&s;tify again&s;t the au|thoritative toleration of all religions, as the occa&s;ion and &s;ource of errors, here&s;ies, and bla&s;phemies.&mdash; They declare their adherence to the <HI>Solemn League

and Covenant,</HI> and to the <HI>divine right</HI> of Presbytery; and their di&s;like of Prelacy, Era&s;tiani&s;m, Indepen|dency, Browni&s;m, and their abhorrence of Anti|&s;cripturi&s;m, Popery, Arminiani&s;m, Ariani&s;m, Soci|niani&s;m, Antinomiani&s;m, Anabapti&s;m, Libertini&s;m, and Schi&s;m. This Te&s;timony was &s;ub&s;cribed by 58 of the principal clergy in London, and afterwards by 64 in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, 84 in Lanca&s;hire, 83 in De|von&s;hire, and 71 in Somer&s;et&s;hire.</P>
<P>This year, the army, mad for a toleration of all, or almo&s;t all, pretences to religion, a&s;&s;umed a &s;upe|riority over the parliament, and turned out &s;ome of the Presbyterian members. Charles at once treated with the Engli&s;h parliament, now governed by the army, and with the di&s;contented Scots, that were forming an <HI>Engagement,</HI> and rai&s;ing an army to re|&s;cue him. He altered his conde&s;cen&s;ions, as his cir|cum&s;tances changed, and probably intended merely to amu&s;e his &s;ubjects, with treaties relative to religion, which he never meant to fulfil. Notwith&s;tanding refu&s;al of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and the mo&s;t &s;currilous abu&s;e from the heads and &s;tudents of Oxford, the parlia|ment's commi&s;&s;ioners vi&s;ited that univer&s;ity, which, for &s;ome years before, had rather been a garri&s;on, than a place of learning. It is hard to &s;ay, whether the patience of the parliament, or the in&s;olence of the univer&s;ity was mo&s;t remarkable, during the two years in which this affair was in agitation. Be&s;ides others, nineteen or twenty ma&s;ters were turned out, and Edward Reynolds, Wilkins, W&s;lkin&s;on, Palmer, Sethward, Wallis, L. Moulin, and others were put in their place. Holy-days and &s;tage-plays being pro|hibited by the parliament, multitudes in &s;ome places were highly provoked, and abu&s;ed &s;uch as dared to work on the&s;e holy, or rather revelling, &s;ea&s;ons.&mdash; But they had no rea&s;on, as in place of them, the parliament allowed &s;ervants the fir&s;t Tue&s;day of eve|ry month for recreation and vi&s;iting of friends.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of a treaty with his maje&s;ty, duke Hamilton and his party of Scots invaded England

with an army to re&s;cue him from the Parliamentari|ans, while the Engli&s;h royali&s;ts took arms for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Cromwel quickly routed them both. While he and his army were in the North, dealing with the Scots, the Presbyterian members re&s;umed their &s;eats in parliament, and became the majority. Knowing that the army were bent for a common|wealth in the &s;tate, and an authoritative toleration to attend any religious e&s;tabli&s;hment in the church, they, in&s;tigated by the more zealous clergymen, en|acted, That who&s;oever &s;hould ob&s;tinately deny the exi&s;tence or perfections of God, or his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in three per&s;ons equal in power and glory; or the rea|lity of Chri&s;t's manhood, or his &s;atisfaction to God's ju&s;tice for &s;inful men; or the divine authority of the &s;criptures; or the re&s;urrection of the dead; or the future judgment, &s;hould be puni&s;hed with death:&mdash; That who&s;oever &s;hould ob&s;tinately maintain, That all men &s;hall be &s;aved; or that men can turn them|&s;elves to God; or that God may be wor&s;hipped by images; or, that the &s;ouls of men either die with their bodies, or &s;leep till the re&s;urrection; or that there is a purgatory; or that the revelations and wor|kings of God's Spirit are a rule of faith or practice, even when different from, or contrary to &s;cripture; or that men are bound to believe no more in religion, than they can comprehend; or that the moral law is no rule of life to believers; or that believers need not repent of their &s;in or pray for its pardon; or that bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper are not appointed in &s;cripture to be continued in the church; or that the bapti&s;m of infants is unlawful; or that the &s;trict ob&s;ervation of the Lord's day is not agreeable to the word of God; or that public and family prayers, and teaching of children to pray, are unlawful; or that the pre&s;ent Engli&s;h form of magi&s;tracy by king and parliament is unlawful; or that all u&s;e of warlike arms is unlawful,&mdash;&s;hall be obliged publicly to recant their error in the congregations, in which they had
<PB N="229" REF="231">
&s;pread it; and, in ca&s;e of refu&s;al, be impri&s;oned till they find &s;ecurity, that they will never more main|tain and publi&s;h any &s;uch error. They al&s;o made a new ordinance, in which all their former acts relative to Presbyterian government and di&s;cipline, were col|lected and ratified as the <HI>&s;tanding laws</HI> of the king|dom. But no penalty was denounced again&s;t &s;uch as &s;hould not &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>The parliament al&s;o laboured to accommodate matters with his maje&s;ty, who had &s;lipt off to New|port in the I&s;le of Wight, and were extremely fond to have the treaty concluded before their army re|turned from the North. But, notwith&s;tanding all that their learned doctors could &s;ay to per&s;uade him, that Prelacy had no divine warrant, and that he might con&s;ent to the aboli&s;hment of it, and to the u&s;e of the <HI>Directory for wor&s;hip,</HI> without hurting his con&s;cience, or violating his coronation oath, he, in|&s;tigated by his bigotted Epi&s;copalians, would make no conce&s;&s;ions, but what were extorted from him. At la&s;t, he, in this manner, con&s;ented, that all the hierarchy, except the bi&s;hops, &s;hould be aboli&s;hed; that they &s;hould not act but in concert with presby|ters; that Presbyterian government &s;hould continue three years; that after that no epi&s;copal authority &s;hall be exerci&s;ed, but by authority of parliament; that, if in that time he be convinced, that Prelacy is not agreeable to the word of God, he will utterly aboli&s;h it. He &s;oon after added, that for three years he would make no new bi&s;hops, and would u&s;e &s;ome other form of divine &s;ervice than the Book of com|mon prayer in his chapel, and prohibit the &s;aying of ma&s;s in the queen's. The Commons voted the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions un&s;atisfactory, but in a few days voted otherwi&s;e. The parliament's commi&s;&s;ioners did what they could to bring him a little further, and to per|&s;uade him that no Prelacy was aboli&s;hed, but what had been &s;et up by human laws; that there was no difficulty in the rever&s;ion of the church lands to the crown; and that the A&s;&s;embly's <HI>Directory</HI> pointed
<PB REF="232">
out the matter of public prayers, though not the ex|pre&s;s words. But notwith&s;tanding all that they, and the Scotch commi&s;&s;ioners from both church and &s;tate could do, he would promi&s;e no more, than to reduce Epi&s;copacy to archbi&s;hop U&s;her's plan, and to licen&s;e the <HI>Shorter Catechi&s;m.</HI></P>
<P>Part of the army returning from the North, and finding, that no toleration of di&s;&s;enters from the e&s;|tabli&s;hed religion was &s;ecured, by the negotiations between Charles and his parliament, they were en|raged at both. They concluded, that if he could obtain the u&s;e of the <HI>&s;ervice book</HI> in his own chapel, Independents and &s;ectaries need expect no liberty of con&s;cience at all; and &s;o they had been fighting to &s;et up Presbytery, and get them&s;elves bani&s;hed the country, or driven into corners. In the&s;e views, they, after a &s;olemn fa&s;t of &s;everal days, re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ume the government of the nation, cut off the king's head, and erect a Commonwealth. On Nov. 20th, 1648, they pre&s;ented a petition to the parlia|ment, &s;etting forth the mi&s;carriage of Charles' go|vernment, and his dilatory and double dealing in treaties; and required, That he and other delin|quents be brought to ju&s;tice for their conduct; that the prince of Wales and duke of York &s;urrender them&s;elves, and be declared incapable of govern|ment; that, for the future, no king be admitted, but by the free election of the people.</P>
<P>Shocked with the&s;e demands, the Commons &s;hif|ted the con&s;ideration of them for ten days, till the treaty with his maje&s;ty was quite broken off. But the army detached a party to Newport, who, on the very next day, &s;eized his per&s;on, and brought him to Wind&s;or. Entering London, they apprehended &s;orty of the leading Commons, and refu&s;ed entrance to an hundred more. None were left but about 150 or 200, mo&s;t of them officers of the army, who carried every thing by direction from the council of military officers at St. Alban's. They made an ordinance, and erected a <HI>ju&s;ticiary court</HI> for the trial of his ma|je&s;ty,
<PB N="231" REF="233">
as a traitor to his country. Becau&s;e the Lords rejected their ordinance, they no move acknowledged them. None but Hugh Peters and John Goodwin of the Independent clergy had any hand in promot|ing his death. The bigotted Epi&s;copalians encou|raged him in that ob&s;tinacy which occa&s;ioned it.&mdash; Some Epi&s;copalians, as well as Presbyterians, were members of the Hou&s;e of Commons, when the or|dinance was made for his trial. But I know not whether any of them concurred in it. The Papi&s;ts are &s;aid to have mightily promoted it, in order to throw the nation into confu&s;ion, and afford opportu|nity of introducing Popery under the Popi&s;hly edu|cated princes, or otherwi&s;e. But the mo&s;t furious managers of the tragedy were Sectarians, Indepen|dents, Anabapti&s;ts, and Hobbi&s;ts. They &s;olicited the Presbyterian mini&s;ters of London to &s;ide with the army, or el&s;e be &s;ilent. In&s;tead of this, forty-&s;even of them publi&s;hed a <HI>monitory addre&s;s</HI> to the general and council of war, repre&s;enting to them their per|jury and wickedne&s;s in invading the rights of parlia|ment, and &s;eizing the king. As the Prelatic divines, to avert men's eyes from their own folly and guilt, reproached the Presbyterians as the cau&s;e of his ma|je&s;ty's di&s;tre&s;s, the mo&s;t of tho&s;e who had &s;ub&s;cribed this addre&s;s, with 19 others, publi&s;hed a vindication of their own conduct, and a warning to all the &s;ub|jects to avoid every thing tending towards the tole|ration of here&s;y or bla&s;phemy,&mdash;or to divide the kingdoms of England and Scotland,&mdash;and calling them to bewail the &s;ins which had thus reduced the nation, and to cry to God for his maje&s;ty's delive|rance. Nineteen clergymen about Oxford, mo&s;tly Presbyterians, but &s;ome Independents, addre&s;&s;ed ge|neral Fairfax and his council of war, be&s;eeching them to lay a&s;ide all thoughts again&s;t his maje&s;ty's life, and to endeavour to promote a right under&s;tan|ding between him and his parliament; and prote&s;ting, that they &s;hall be free of their &s;overeign's death, and of all the mi&s;eries that &s;hall follow on it. The Scots,
<PB N="232" REF="234">
by <HI>remon&s;trances</HI> from both church and &s;tate, did what they could to &s;ave him. But nothing could &s;top the wild career of the furious officers, till they had condemned and beheaded him, Jan. 30th, 1649.</P>
<P>Charles was &s;ober, temperate, and cha&s;te; a kind husband, parent, and ma&s;ter. But his encouraging of &s;ports on Sabbath, marks him no tender Chri&s;tian. His favour to, and employment of Papi&s;ts, while be hated and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed his Puritan &s;ubjects, and his now well known hand in the Iri&s;h ma&s;&s;acre, are but poor evidences of his being a &s;incere Prote&s;tant. In his treaties with his parliament, want of candour and fidelity appears every where. In politics, his whole government was one continued &s;eries of blunders.&mdash; Nothing more exalted his character than the publi|&s;hing of the EICON BASILIKE in his name, which repre&s;ented him as extremely pious and devout, a|mid&s;t his manifold troubles. It was printed &s;oon af|ter his death, and had more than fifty editions. But it was at la&s;t di&s;covered, that Dr. Gauden had wrote the whole of it, except the 16th and 24th chapters, which were written by Dr. Duppa. Since the re&s;to|ration of his &s;on in 1660, the 30th of January hath been, by law, ob&s;erved in commemoration of his martyrdom, on which many thou&s;and fal&s;hoods and ful&s;ome flatteries are yearly retailed from Epi&s;copalian pulpits, in the name of the Lord.</P>
<P>A commonwealth being erected, Cromwel and the army quickly, and with no &s;mall &s;everity, reduced the Papi&s;ts in Ireland. About an hundred thou&s;and of them fled into France, and the re&s;t were pent up in corners, in which they could &s;carcely find &s;ub&s;i&s;|tence. Epi&s;copacy was reduced; the univer&s;ity of Dublin was purged, and religion and learning flou|ri&s;hed in it. The parliament having formed an en|gagement or oath of allegiance to the commonwealth, few Epi&s;copalians &s;crupled at it. Many of the Pre&s;|byterian clergy refu&s;ed it, and left their pari&s;hes, which were filled up with Independents, who migh|tily reli&s;hed the new form of government. For the
<PB N="233" REF="235">
&s;ake of peace, the parliament continued the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of Presbyterian government, and of the <HI>Di|rectory for wor&s;hip,</HI> but aboli&s;hed all penalties on ac||count of differences in religion. The Presbyterian mini&s;ters at their monthly fa&s;ts, being apt to throw out reflections again&s;t the new government and ma|nagers of it, the parliament aboli&s;hed the&s;e meetings, and prohibited clergymen's meddling with politics. They al&s;o prohibited the publication or di&s;per&s;ion of &s;editious pamphlets. While the parliament provided mini&s;ters and &s;chool-ma&s;ters for Wales, the Presby|terian and Independent clergy laboured fo ince&s;&s;antly in the in&s;truction of their people, that &s;obriety pre|vailed almo&s;t every where in the kingdom. Amid&s;t all the ab&s;urd fancies which prevailed in the army, &s;uch, was their &s;trictne&s;s, that, when one of their quarter-ma&s;ters was convicted of bla&s;phemy, he had his tongue bored with an hot iron, his &s;word broken over his head, and was expelled from the troops, by order of the council of the army. The Papi&s;ts were bani&s;hed twenty miles from London, and excepted in the parliament's acts of indulgence and toleration.

<P><PB N="234" REF="236">Profe&s;&s;ing regard to their <HI>covenant,</HI> the Scots had admitted Charles II. as his father's &s;ucce&s;&s;or to their crown.

with Me&s;&s;rs. Vines, Manton, Jacomb, Cheynel, and Reyner, were, in 1654, appointed to fix the fundamental principles of the Chri&s;tian religion, ac|cording to which the toleration might be limited. R.

By the&s;e ar|ticles, Dei&s;ts, Socinians, Arians, Papi&s;ts, Quakers, and Antinomians are excluded from the benefit of the toleration. But, as Cromwel and his council were for protecting every one that lived peaceably, no u&s;e was made of this draught.</P>
<P>Not chu&s;ing that Presbyterial cla&s;&s;es &s;hould have the power of admitting clergymen chiefly in their hand, Cromwel and his council appointed a commit|tee of twenty-nine of the mo&s;t eminent mini&s;ters in England, partly Presbyterians, partly Independents, three Anabapti&s;ts, and nine gentlemen, to try &s;uch as had entered the preceding year, or &s;hould after|ward enter to the mini&s;try, with re&s;pect to their gifts

and graces. Five were &s;tated a &s;ufficient <HI>quorum</HI> to approve a man, and nine to reject him. As mo&s;t of the members of this committee re&s;ided at London, &s;uch as could not come thither were tried by a &s;ub|committee. No candidate was admitted to trial, un|le&s;s he produced a certificate &s;igned by three per&s;ons of known integrity, atte&s;ting, upon their own know|ledge, that he was of an holy and good conver&s;ation. Finding that &s;ome &s;eque&s;tred Epi&s;copalians &s;tood the trial, and were admitted back to their charges, Crom|wel and his council appointed that none &s;uch &s;hould be admitted, till they were &s;atisfied of their &s;ubmi&s;&s;i|on to the pre&s;ent government. Such as were rejec|ted, and their friends, exclaimed terribly again&s;t the TRIERS proceedings. But Baxter, who was far e|nough from loving the chief men among them, &s;ays, They did much good to the church, &s;aved many congregations from drunken, ignorant, and ungodly teachers, and admitted &s;uch as were learned, godly, and &s;erious, be of what tolerable opinion they would; only they too much favoured the Independents, and were too apt to reject Epi&s;copalians and Arminians. If the candidate's learning, orthodoxy, piety, and peaceablene&s;s were manife&s;tly certain, as in the ca&s;e of Fuller the hi&s;torian, they made little enquiry into his gracious experiences. But when they knew him to be malignant, immoral, a Pelagian or Socinian, they, by examination of his experiences and the like, laboured to have him rejected.</P>
<P>As notwith&s;tanding all former purgations, there &s;till remained not a few &s;candalous or negligent pa&s;|tors and teachers, Cromwel and his council appointed for every county a committee of laymen with ten or more mini&s;ters to purge them out, and allow them a 5th part of their &s;alary for the &s;upport of their fami|lies.&mdash;In 1649, an ordinance had been made for the purgation and proper &s;ettlement of the churches in Wales. But though they had got 150 mini&s;ters, who laboured to their utmo&s;t, they were not nearly &s;upplied. Some itinerant preachers were therefore
<PB N="237" REF="239">
appointed to labour among them for the pre&s;ent.&mdash; Some of the le&s;&s;er congregations were joined toge|ther, and others of the large&s;t &s;ort were divided.&mdash; New committees were appointed to vi&s;it the univer|&s;ities of Cambridge and Oxford. The&s;e, as well as the Heads of the colleges, faithfully executed their offices, in con&s;equence of which &s;obriety and godli|ne&s;s remarkably prevailed in the&s;e &s;eminaries of learn|ing. Stillingfleet, Pear&s;on, Patrick, Lowth, and others of the greate&s;t men, that ever appeared in the Engli&s;h church, were bred up under the&s;e Puritan doctors; and nothing, but horrid impiety and ty|ranny, felt the exclu&s;ion of the royal bigots.&mdash;Mean|while, the Pre&s;byterian Synod of London finding it impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;tabli&s;h their di&s;cipline among the Engli&s;h, and awakened by the &s;pread of two Cate|chi&s;ms publi&s;hed by Biddle a Socinian, be&s;tirred them&s;elves to promote the religious education of youth, and publi&s;hed exhortations and directions for mini&s;ters and heads of families in their catechizing work. Animated by their example, the a&s;&s;ociated mini&s;ters in &s;everal counties publi&s;hed &s;imilar exhor|tations.</P>
<P>As the Royali&s;ts had threatened Cromwel with an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, and had publi&s;hed mo&s;t dangerous li|bels again&s;t the pre&s;ent government, he, by a pro|clamation, ordered, that no ejected Epi&s;copalians &s;hould be chaplains or &s;choolma&s;ters, or preach, or teach any but their own families, under pain of pro|&s;ecution. But, he more &s;ecretly intimated, that tho&s;e who, &s;ince their &s;eque&s;tration, had or &s;hould give proper evidence of their godline&s;s and affection to the pre&s;ent government, &s;hould be u&s;ed as kindly, as could con&s;i&s;t with the &s;afety of the &s;tate. About the &s;ame time, he threatened the Papi&s;ts, not &s;o much for their religion, as becau&s;e he found them enemies to his government. The Prote&s;tants of Savoy and Piedmont being terribly per&s;ecuted, he, by applica|tion to the kings of Sweden and Denmark, the States of Holland, and the Reformed churches in Germany
<PB N="238" REF="240">
and France, procured them large contributions. In England alone, 37,079 pounds were collected. He di&s;patched Moreland his envoy to the duke of Savoy, to intimate to him, that he intended to exert him&s;elf to his uttermo&s;t for the deliverance of his per&s;ecuted Prote&s;tant brethren. He wrote to Lewis XIV. and to cardinal Mazarine his mini&s;ter to the &s;ame effect. Unwilling to have Cromwel and his troops &s;o near him, Mazarine pre&s;&s;ed the court of Turin to give the Prote&s;tants &s;atisfaction. To &s;trike terror into the Pope, and other Italian princes, he gave out, that as he under&s;tood, they had encouraged the per|&s;ecution, he intended that his fleet &s;hould vi&s;it their coa&s;ts, and cau&s;e the &s;ound of his canons to be heard at Rome. He publicly declared, that he would al|low no Prote&s;tants to be any where in&s;ulted, and procured indulgence to tho&s;e of Bohemia and France. <HI>How di&s;graceful to the Prote&s;tant powers, that they have ever &s;ince &s;o little copied his example!</HI> Whether he had any hand in founding the charitable fund for the &s;upport of mini&s;ters widows and children, which took place about this time, I know not.</P>
<P>The indulgence of &s;o many forms of religion in England drew the famous Mana&s;&s;eh ben I&s;rael, and other rabbies of the Jewi&s;h nation thither, to &s;olicit a freedom for their religion and traffick. As Crom|wel thought they might, by the pure preaching of the go&s;pel, be converted to Chri&s;t, and might pu&s;h the Engli&s;h into trade, he inclined to grant them their reque&s;t. But, in order to do it peaceably, he conveened a council of lawyers, merchants and di|vines, to con&s;ider, whether it would con&s;i&s;t with the laws of the land, the advantage of trade, and rule<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the go&s;pel? Some were altogether again&s;t their admi&s;&s;ion, le&s;t they &s;hould &s;educe people to their re|ligion or cu&s;toms of marriage and divorce; or their fraud hurt the trade of the &s;ubjects: Others though<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they might be admitted, providing they &s;hould &s;peak or write nothing again&s;t the honour of Chri&s;t or hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> religion; &s;hould hold no judicatory civil or eccle&s;ia&s;+tical;

The opinions of the&s;e advi&s;ers being &s;o different, the affair was dropt.</P>
<P>In 1656, the Quakers had become con&s;iderably trouble&s;ome and in&s;olent, even to Cromwel him&s;elf, which drew upon them &s;ome &s;everities. The Papi&s;ts had an oath impo&s;ed upon them, abjuring the Pope's &s;upremacy, tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, purgatory, wor&s;hip of images and relicks,&mdash;the merit of human works,&mdash; the Pope's power to excommunicate or depo&s;e magi|&s;trates, or give allowance to murder them,&mdash;and de|claring, that they believed him to have no power at all in Britain or Ireland; and that no power derived from him or the church of Rome could ab&s;olve from this oath. Two thirds of their e&s;tate, who refu&s;ed this oath, were to be &s;eized for public u&s;e; and all Briti&s;h &s;ubjects were prohibited to hear ma&s;s in the hou&s;e of any foreign amba&s;&s;ador.</P>
<P>In 1657, Brian Walton, afterwards bi&s;hop of Che&s;ter, publi&s;hed his famous <HI>Polyglot Bible,</HI> in &s;ix large volumes folio; in the preparation and correcti|on of which he had employed not a few of the mo&s;t learned Puritans and others. Dr. Owen highly com|mended the work, but blamed Walton for pretend|ing that the Hebrew points were not of divine autho|rity, and for collecting &s;o many <HI>various readings</HI> from copies of no importance. About this time al&s;o, the Royal Society began to be founded.</P>
<P>In 1658, the Independents, by Cromwel's permi&s;|&s;ion, held an A&s;&s;embly at the Savoy, and drew up their <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith.</HI> It differs but little from that of We&s;tmin&s;ter, unle&s;s that the 30th and 31&s;t chapters relative to cen&s;ures and Synods, and part of the 20th, 23d, and 24th, relative to the power of civil magi&s;trates about religious matters, and to marriage and divorce, are left out.

relative to the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> and &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions more plainly pointed again&s;t the then rampant errors: and at the end, it hath a chapter relative to the in&s;tituti|on of the church, and to eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;cipline.&mdash; At this meeting, in which there were mini&s;ters and members from 100 churches, tho' Dr. Owen, Me&s;&s;. Goodwin, Nye, Bridges, Caryl, and Greenhill were the principal managers, it is the le&s;s wonder, that they formed their Confe&s;&s;ion in a few days. The difference between it, and that of We&s;tmin&s;ter, being &s;o &s;mall, that the modern Independents have almo&s;t laid it a&s;ide, and u&s;e that of We&s;tmin&s;ter as well as the Pre&s;byterians, excepting the portions above men|tioned.</P>
<P>Death having, that &s;ame year, cut off the bold, and crafty, and perhaps pious Protector, the govern|ment devolved on Richard his &s;on, a young man of a candid and peaceable temper. Fleetwood his bro|ther-in-law, and De&s;borough, who had married his aunt, and Lambert, and other di&s;contented &s;pirits, re&s;umed their courage, and quickly obliged him to re&s;ign his authority. A <HI>commonwealth,</HI> of a few weeks duration, en&s;ued: but the officers finding, that the parliament intended to reduce the army, took the government into their own hands. The nation being quickly &s;ick of the&s;e military lords, the Pre&s;byteri|ans and Royali&s;ts agreed to bring home Charles of Scotland, who had been an exile abroad. Having invited General Monk from Scotland, he, by ways and means di&s;honourable enough, got to London, re&s;tored the Pre&s;byterian members of parliament to their &s;eats, from which they had been excluded in 1648, and placed guards about the Hou&s;e, which deterred the Independents from entering. Being now almo&s;t wholly Pre&s;byterians, the Commons rati|fied the vote of 1648, bearing, that Charles I's con|ce&s;&s;ions from the I&s;le of Wight were a &s;atisfactory ground of a pacification with him. They annulled the <HI>engagement</HI> of 1649, to be faithful to the com|monwealth, and the late oath <HI>abjuring</HI> Charles Stew|art.
<PB N="241" REF="243">
In con&s;equence of a petition from the London mini&s;ters, they approved the <HI>Solemn League and Co|venant;</HI> they declared the <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith</HI> the public Confe&s;&s;ion of the church of Eng|land; but agreed that due liberty in religious mat|ters be &s;ecured according to the word of God. They approved as valid the ordinations of mini&s;ters accord|ing to the <HI>Directory,</HI> and gave Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their benefices. In May 1660, they di&s;&s;olved them&s;elves, after they had, in divers forms, and with &s;everal interruptions, &s;at <HI>nineteen</HI> years, four months, and thirteen days.</P>
<P>Before their di&s;&s;olution, they had enacted, That none, who had warred again&s;t the parliament &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce 1641, and had not &s;ince manife&s;ted their affection to it, &s;hould be elected members for the next; and that all candidates &s;hould declare the parliament's war again&s;t king Charles to have been ju&s;t and law|ful. But now, to avoid all choice of republicans, many Royali&s;ts and per&s;ons ab&s;olutely athei&s;tical and profane were cho&s;en. Meanwhile, Monk began to treat with Charles king of Scots, and &s;everal of the Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters repaired to him at Breda in Holland. His embracement of Popery beginning to make a noi&s;e, he decoyed &s;everal of the mo&s;t eminent Prote&s;tant clergymen in France to give a&s;&s;urances of the contrary. He tran&s;mitted to London a DECLA|RATION, promi&s;ing a general pardon of pa&s;t offen|ces, and a liberty in religion to all his &s;ubjects, if he &s;hould be re&s;tored to his throne. Infatuated by his guileful prayers, and deceitful declarations, and by the fine promi&s;es of Epi&s;copalians, of who&s;e perfidiou&s;|ne&s;s they had had &s;ufficient experience, the Pre&s;byte|rians permitted the new parliament to invite him home without any terms. After this parliament had &s;at about eight months, they were di&s;&s;olved, becau&s;e the members had not been cho&s;en by virtue of royal warrants, and many of them were Pre&s;byterians; and they had declared the late war with his maje&s;ty's father to have been lawful.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="244">CHARLES had no &s;ooner arrived at White|hall, than, for a blind, he made Me&s;&s;.

But the <HI>old</HI> liturgy was re&s;tored in his chapel and el&s;ewhere,&mdash;pretending that, the acts of the long parliament being in them&s;elves null, for want of the royal a&s;&s;ent, <HI>Epi&s;copacy</HI> and the <HI>&s;ervice book</HI> were &s;till e&s;tabli&s;hed by law.

The &s;eque&s;tred Epi&s;copalians flocked about the court, magnified their own &s;ufferings as a kind of martyrdom for his maje&s;ty's right, and, notwith|&s;tanding their mo&s;t notorious &s;candals, were re&s;tored to their former places, and the pious, learned, and laborious Pre&s;byterians or Independents turned out to make way for them.

A little before the Re&s;toration, a fruitle&s;s attempt had been made to fill the vacant &s;ees, le&s;t the epi&s;copal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;hould be ruined: but deans and chapters being now re&s;tored to every cathedral, ten new bi&s;h|ops were added to the nine &s;urvivors.

remarkable ornaments to the Engli&s;h church. Bet|ter laws were never made in England, nor good laws ever &s;o well executed. The dre&s;s, the language and conver&s;ation of the people, were &s;ober and virtuous. Scarcely one in&s;tance of bankruptcy was known, in a year; nor could bankrupts ever regain their cha|racter. Drunkenne&s;s, whoredom, profane &s;wearing, and other debaucheries, were quite out of fa&s;hion. To live as bea&s;ts, without wor&s;hipping God in &s;ecret and in families, was held infamous. Not one &s;tage play was acted for many years in the whole kingdom. Magi&s;trates carefully &s;uppre&s;&s;ed gaming and other abu&s;es in public hou&s;es. Mini&s;ters laboured in pray|ing, preaching, catechizing, and vi&s;iting their peo|ple, to the wa&s;ting of their &s;trength. But no &s;ooner had Charles a&s;cended his throne, than debauchery and wickedne&s;s of every form, like an impetuous tor|rent, brake forth and overflowed all ranks in the kingdom. He &s;et them a mo&s;t bruti&s;h and infernal example. He did not believe there was any &s;uch thing as honour or virtue, but all men were guided by &s;elf intere&s;t. Athei&s;m, profane &s;coffing and &s;wear|ing, were his daily delight; drunkenne&s;s and whore|dom his principal bu&s;ine&s;s. He could &s;carcely &s;pare an hour from them, to mind the affairs of the &s;tate. If we may believe his own bi&s;hops and doctors, he ordinarily came from the bed of his harlots to church, or even to the Lord's table. Two play-hou&s;es were erected in the neighbourhood of his court. Female actre&s;&s;es were introduced on the &s;tage. Plays &s;o lewd and ob&s;cene, as might have made Beelzebub to blu&s;h, were compo&s;ed and acted. Scarcely any thing was to be &s;een at court, but fea&s;ting, hard drinking, re|velling, whoredom, and profane &s;wearing. The fa|voured clergymen were taken with whores almo&s;t every week, or found, drunk in the &s;treets, or even in the pulpits. All kinds of riot and debauchery prevailed among the people.

Calamy, Reynolds, A&s;he, Bax|ter, Wallis, Manton, and Spur&s;tow, introduced by the earl of Manche&s;ter, be&s;ought his maje&s;ty to in|terpo&s;e his influence for the healing of their eccle&s;i|a&s;tical differences, hoping, as Baxter &s;aid, that he would outdo Cromwel the u&s;urper, in promoting re|ligion. Charles bade them draw up their propo&s;als relative to church government and ceremonies, as low as p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ible, and then he would procure them a conference with the epi&s;copal doctors. Having fini|&s;hed it, they, along with their brethren in London, pre&s;ented their propo&s;als, bearing, That they agreed with their brethren in the doctrinal points of religion, and the &s;ub&s;tantial parts of divine wor&s;hip; but hum|bly reque&s;ted, That none of their &s;erious people
<PB N="245" REF="247">
might be reproached with abu&s;ive language; that no &s;candalous, negligent, or in&s;ufficient per&s;on, might be admitted pa&s;tor in any congregation; that none &s;hould be confirmed by the bi&s;hops, or admitted to the Lord's table, without a credible profe&s;&s;ion of faith and holine&s;s; that effectual care &s;hould be ta|ken for the public and private &s;anctification of the Lord's day; that Epi&s;copacy be reduced to the plan propo&s;ed by archbi&s;hop U&s;her in 1641; that &s;uffra|gans be cho&s;en by their re&s;pective Synods; that, in their vi&s;itations, bi&s;hops regulate their conduct by the appointments of parliament; that the <HI>Book of common prayer</HI> be either corrected and purged of that which is offen&s;ive, or a committee of moderate Epi&s;|copalians and Pre&s;byterians appointed to compile a new one, as much in &s;cripture language as po&s;&s;ible; &mdash;and mini&s;ters not be confined to preci&s;e forms;&mdash; and that cro&s;&s;ing in bapti&s;m, kneeling at the Lord's &s;upper, ob&s;ervation of holy days of human appoint|ment, officiating in &s;urplices, altars in churches, bowing at the name JESUS, or towards altars, be a|boli&s;hed, or at lea&s;t not impo&s;ed on &s;uch as &s;cruple them. The an&s;wer given to this repre&s;entation, by the Epi&s;copalians, occa&s;ioned a &s;hort and &s;omewhat warm an&s;wer, by the Pre&s;byterians.</P>
<P>As many of the &s;ober mini&s;ters began to be driven from their churches, on account of their not u&s;ing the <HI>Book of common prayer,</HI> the chief Pre&s;byterians be&s;ought his maje&s;ty to &s;u&s;pend the&s;e executions, till the i&s;&s;ue of their attempts for an accommodation were known; and that he would revoke the ejection of &s;uch as had only &s;ucceeded to decea&s;ed Epi&s;copalians, and prevent the return of &s;candalous clergymen to their former charges. But all was to little purpo&s;e. After hearing both parties, he corrected and publi&s;h|ed his <HI>&s;econd Declaration,</HI> in which he promi&s;ed to reform Epi&s;copacy, and have the Liturgy corrected; and that none &s;hould be que&s;tioned for differences in religion, not tending to di&s;turb the peace of the kingdom. Not a few of the Pre&s;byterian clergy were
<PB N="246" REF="248">
plea&s;ed with this, thanked his maje&s;ty for it, and upon the foot of it, pious Edward Reynolds accepted the bi&s;hoprick of Norwich, and Dr. Manton, re|ceiving a living in Convent garden, &s;ubmitted to e|pi&s;copal ordination by Sheldon bi&s;hop of London, and to the u&s;e of the <HI>&s;ervice book</HI> in his church. O|ther Pre&s;byterians, &s;till di&s;&s;atisfied, again be&s;ought his maje&s;ty to e&s;tabli&s;h archbi&s;hop U&s;her's &s;cheme of church government, which they thought was con&s;i&s;|tent with their Solemn League and Covenant; and in&s;i&s;ted for further alterations in the <HI>&s;ervice book,</HI> than he appeared to have promi&s;ed. They prevailed no|thing. When the la&s;t mentioned <HI>declaration</HI> was fir&s;t read in parliament, Nov. 9th, both Hou&s;es agreed on an addre&s;s of thanks for it; but being informed, that Charles and his courtiers never intended to &s;tand to it, the Commons refu&s;ed to give it a &s;econd read|ing.</P>
<P>By this time, the long infatuated Pre&s;byterians had their eyes opened, and plainly perceived, that his maje&s;ty's declarations were but crafty expedients to keep them quiet, till their Epi&s;copalian enemies could bid them defiance: and they had daily more and more evidence, that they had no favour at court.&mdash; If they &s;poke or wrote in favour of their covenant with God and one another; if they lamented the dreadful irruption of perfidy, apo&s;tacy, or vice, e|&s;pecially of courtiers; if they &s;crupled u&s;ing of the &s;urplice, &s;ervice book, and ceremonies, they were pro&s;ecuted in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, and hundreds of them turned out, to make way, even for the mo&s;t &s;candalous Epi&s;copalians, who had been formerly e|jected. Meanwhile, flocks of Papi&s;ts came home, magnified their &s;ufferings in the late times, and pu|bli&s;hed a li&s;t of about 179 of their noblemen, knights, baronets, and other per&s;ons of rank, who had lo&s;t their lives in fighting for Charles and his father. His mother returned from France, with a crowd of Po|pi&s;h attendants. The prie&s;ts, who had been in gaol, were liberated, and others came over from the col|lege
<PB N="247" REF="249">
of Douay. More Papi&s;ts appeared in England, than in all the twelve preceding years. In Ireland too, which, under the late troubles, had been not a little furni&s;hed with faithful, laborious, and &s;ucce&s;s|ful mini&s;ters from England and Scotland, the Papi&s;ts took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their old e&s;tates, and turned out the Prote&s;tant purcha&s;ers. Their prie&s;ts &s;ent over an Addre&s;s, congratulating his maje&s;ty's <HI>re&s;toration,</HI> and reque&s;ting the free exerci&s;e of their religion.&mdash; Their Addre&s;s was graciou&s;ly received, and they were encouraged to hope for a favourable an&s;wer.&mdash; Charles' marriage with the Infanta of Portugal al&s;o contributed to the promoting of their intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>Venner a wine-hooper, and about fifty others of the <HI>Fifth-monarchy men,</HI> who imagined that the <HI>thou&s;and years</HI> empire of Je&s;us Chri&s;t's per&s;onal reign on earth was ju&s;t to be erected, took arms, re&s;olving to overturn Charles' government, or peri&s;h in the attempt. This madne&s;s, cru&s;hed in a moment, gave the court an handle for emitting a proclamation, prohibiting all Anabapti&s;ts, Quakers, and Fifth-mo|narchy men, to meet for wor&s;hip any where but in pari&s;h churches or chapels, or in their own hou&s;es. The Independents, Bapti&s;ts, and Quakers, for their own vindication, publi&s;hed a declaration of their ab|horrence of Venner's in&s;urrection. To provoke the Pre&s;byterians to &s;ome like outrage, the Epi&s;copalians or Papi&s;ts in&s;ulted them in the &s;treets, and di&s;turbed them at their family wor&s;hip, by blowing of horns at their windows, or the like. Amid&s;t all this abu&s;e, they maintained a quiet and inviolated loyalty, tho', from the Pre&s;s, they hone&s;tly contended for their religious principles. Stillingfleet, a very learned, and as yet mild, Epi&s;copalian, publi&s;hed his <HI>Irenicum,</HI> in which he pled, That no particular form of church government is exhibited in the New Te&s;tament, and, with great &s;trength of argument, contended, that nothing ought to be impo&s;ed in religion, but what is clearly revealed in the &s;criptures; nothing required but what is plainly indifferent; nothing indifferent
<PB N="248" REF="250">
required, as a part of wor&s;hip, but only as a mean of duly performing it; that no penalty ought to be inflicted upon per&s;ons, who &s;cruple at any thing not clearly revealed in the word of God, till they have &s;ufficient time and means to be informed of the lawfulne&s;s of it; and that religion ought not to be clogged with ceremonies, as too many of them eat out the life and vigour of Chri&s;tianity. But no rea|&s;oning was able to re&s;train the fury of the Epi&s;copa|lians again&s;t the Pre&s;byterians, who had &s;o kindly brought home their king, and put them into po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of their power.</P>
<P>The new parliament, formed to the ta&s;te of the court, which kept about an hundred members in pay, to vote as they plea&s;ed, &s;at down May 8th, 1661. Be&s;ides advancing his maje&s;ty's ab&s;olute pow|er, they declared the &s;olemn league and covenant illegal, and not binding upon &s;uch as had taken it, and ordered it to be publicly burnt by the hangman; they re&s;tored the bi&s;hops to their juri&s;diction in par|liament or otherwi&s;e; the re&s;tored to the Epi&s;copa|lian clergy all the power they had enjoyed under his maje&s;ty's father, except the u&s;e of the oath <HI>ex officio;</HI> they denounced a <HI>Premuniro</HI> again&s;t all &s;uch as &s;hould call his maje&s;ty a Papi&s;t; they enacted, that all in places of power and tru&s;t &s;hould declare upon oath, that they believed it unlawful to take up arms again&s;t the king <HI>on any pretence</HI> what&s;oever, and give it un|der their hand, that they renounce the <HI>&s;olemn league and covenant</HI> as an unlawful oath, impo&s;ed contrary to the &s;tanding laws of the kingdom; they appointed, that none &s;hould act in any civil office, who had not within a year received the Lord's &s;upper, according to the <HI>&s;ervice book;</HI> they appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to vi&s;it all the corporations in the kingdom, and turn out of office all &s;uch as were &s;u&s;pected of di&s;reli&s;hing the mea&s;ures of the court. A &s;ham plot again&s;t the government, fathered upon captain Yarrington, Sparry, Mr. Baxter, and others, was trumpetted up, and reported through the nation, in order to
<PB N="249" REF="251">
make the penal laws again&s;t the Pre&s;byterians and other di&s;&s;enters pa&s;s the more ea&s;ily. Meanwhile, &s;everal of the French Prote&s;tant clergymen, who had per&s;uaded the Pre&s;byterians to receive Charles with|out any conditions, barefacedly congratulated the E|pi&s;copalians upon their re-e&s;tabli&s;hment, and the French pa&s;tor at the Savoy conformed him&s;elf to the Engli&s;h ceremonies.</P>
<P>By virtue of his maje&s;ty's la&s;t declaration, twelve bi&s;hops and nine a&s;&s;i&s;tants were appointed to meet with the Pre&s;byterian chiefs at the Savoy, for fixing what alterations were proper for the &s;atisfaction of tender con&s;ciences, and promoting of the good of the church. Calamy, Baxter, and their brethren, ex|cepted again&s;t eight things in the <HI>Book of common pray|er,</HI> as plainly &s;inful, <HI>viz.</HI> that no mini&s;ter is allowed to baptize any without u&s;ing the &s;ign of the cro&s;s; that no mini&s;ter is allowed to officiate in the public wor&s;hip of God, without wearing the &s;urplice; that none are allowed to receive the Lord's &s;upper but on their knees; that mini&s;ters are obliged to admini&s;ter the Lord's &s;upper to unfit per&s;ons, whether in health or in &s;ickne&s;s, and even to &s;ome who are unwilling to receive it; that mini&s;ters are obliged, without a|ny conditions, to ab&s;olve from &s;candal and guilt of &s;in, per&s;ons of who&s;e repentance they have not the &s;malle&s;t evidence; that they are obliged at funerals to give thanks for all baptized and unexcommuni|cated per&s;ons decea&s;ed, as brethren, whom God hath taken to him&s;elf; and that none are allowed to preach the go&s;pel, who do not, under their &s;ub&s;cription, declare, that there is nothing in the <HI>Thirty nine ar|ticles, Books of common prayer and ordination,</HI> contrary to the word of God. They even pre&s;ented a draught of a <HI>new liturgy</HI> drawn up by Mr. Baxter, the prayers in which were mo&s;tly in the expre&s;s words of &s;crip|ture, which they begged, mini&s;ters might be allowed to u&s;e. The bi&s;hops took it as an horrid affront, to put a production of Baxter on a level with the long approved <HI>biturgy</HI> of their church. As the intention
<PB N="250" REF="252">
of the leading Epi&s;copalians in this di&s;pute, was no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to accommodate matters, but to di&s;cover the Pre&s;by|terians &s;cruples, that they might &s;o fix their term<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of communion, as effectually to exclude them, they did not allow them opportunity of fair, calm, and thorough rea&s;oning; but by brow-beating, and by the hi&s;&s;ing of their attendants, &s;tudied to throw them into confu&s;ion. When the conference was fini&s;hed&punc; a convocation was called to rectify what was ami&s;s in the prayer book, and to &s;upply deficiencies. Care was taken to have it compo&s;ed of &s;uch as hated the Pre&s;byterians, or were the obedient dupes of their &s;uperiors. They added prayers for the annual cele|bration of the <HI>martyrdom</HI> of Charles I. on the 30th of January; and of his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty's <HI>re&s;toration</HI> on May 29th;&mdash;and for per&s;ons at &s;ea; a form of bapti&s;m for adult per&s;ons. They added &s;ome new holy days, and &s;ome new le&s;&s;ons out of the Apocry|pha, as the &s;tupid fable of Bel and the dragon, and &s;o made the book &s;till more exceptionable. They began to review the CANONS, but made no alterations.</P>
<P>Charles and his agents did not content them&s;elves with pro&s;ecuting &s;uch of his father's condemnators as were &s;till alive, but digged up the bodies of Brad|&s;haw and Ireton, and gave them a kind of execution. They al&s;o digged up the bodies of Cromwel's mother, and daughter, and of admiral Blake, Pym, Dr. Twi&s;&s;e, Stephen Mar&s;hal, and fourteen others of the Parlia|mentarians, to put a public &s;tigma upon them.&mdash; The&s;e were but the mo&s;t harmle&s;s pieces of their cruelty. By the in&s;tigation of the court, in May 1662, the Commons, with great readine&s;s, and the Lords, with no &s;mall reluctance, pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Act of uniformity,</HI> importing, That every mini&s;ter that did not, before the fea&s;t of Bartholomew Augu&s;t 24th, before his congregation, when publicly a&s;&s;embled for religious wor&s;hip, declare his unfeigned a&s;&s;ent and con&s;ent to every thing contained in the <HI>Book of com|mon prayer</HI> as lately corrected, and in the <HI>Form of ordination of bi&s;hops, prie&s;ts, and deacons,</HI> &s;hould be,

<P>As there were not quite three months of interval between the pa&s;&s;ing and the final execution of this act, it was impo&s;&s;ible for the <HI>newly corrected</HI> Book of common prayer, to be got printed, di&s;per&s;ed through all the corners of England, and read and con&s;idered before the time elap&s;ed. Neverthele&s;s, &s;even thou&s;and Epi&s;copalian clergymen, of whom not one in forty, it is &s;aid, had &s;een it, believed as the church did, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd from their pulpits &s;olemnly declared their <HI>un|feigned a&s;&s;ent</HI> and <HI>con&s;ent</HI> to it.

Epi&s;copolian clergy, they allowed them a 5th part of their &s;alary to maintain them, even though they were in a &s;tate of war with them as royali&s;ts.&mdash; Now, above two thou&s;and, who had laboured for his maje&s;ty's re&s;toration, and were generally mo&s;t pi|ous and diligent mini&s;ters, were forced from their charges, without the &s;malle&s;t allowance. Baxter and &s;ome other leading men quitted their churches be|fore the time, le&s;t fal&s;e reports of their intended compliance &s;hould &s;educe any of their brethren.&mdash; Reynolds, Wilkins, Hopkins, and Fowler complied, and were made bi&s;hops. Some, who had di&s;&s;uaded their brethren, complied them&s;elves. No doubt, the di&s;tre&s;sful circum&s;tances, to which the ejected were quickly reduced, influenced them. Some of them applied them&s;elves to civil bu&s;ine&s;s, and were &s;up|ported by donations from their friends. Many of them having no freedom to alienate them&s;elves from the public &s;ervice of God, to which they had &s;olemn|ly devoted them&s;elves in ordinations and otherwi&s;e, &mdash;unable to re&s;i&s;t the calls of the people, who beg|ged their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the &s;alvation of their &s;ouls,&mdash; afraid of the cur&s;e of the unprofitable &s;ervant, who hid his Lord's money,&mdash;&s;en&s;ible of the in&s;ufficiency of tho&s;e that were placed in their charges,&mdash;and con|vinced of the continuance of their office and mi&s;&s;ion from Chri&s;t, and of their duty to perpetuate a faith|ful mini&s;try,&mdash;pre&s;umed to preach the go&s;pel; for which, as fa&s;t as they could be apprehended, they were ca&s;t into pri&s;on, where many of them peri&s;hed by hunger and cold,&mdash;their hearers &s;haring much the like per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>The condition of the Engli&s;h church was now ex|ceedingly deplorable. The old clergymen were ge|nerally de&s;pi&s;ed and dete&s;ted, becau&s;e of their &s;can|dalous behaviour. Such as had been trained up un|der the Puritans did &s;ome &s;ervice; but many of them had neither due age nor experience. A &s;taunch but candid Epi&s;copalian informs us, That about 3,000 were admitted, who were unfit to take charges, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="256" REF="258">
of their youth; that 1500 clergymen were &s;candalous, and many of them ignorant;&mdash;and about 1350 factious;&mdash;that of 12,000 eccle&s;ia&s;tical livings, 3,000 were impropriated, and 4165 &s;inecures. Af|ter all the&s;e deductions, how little room is left for an hone&s;t and painful mini&s;try?</P>
<P>Charles and his Popi&s;h courtiers and friends were glad, how many of them were turned out from the church, as they hoped it might occa&s;ion a toleration for the Papi&s;ts along with others. When the Pro|te&s;tant nonconformi&s;ts talked of retiring to Holland or New England, the courtiers or Papi&s;ts di&s;&s;uaded them by hints of a toleration,&mdash;and laboured to di|vide them from the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy as much as po&s;&s;ible. Even the conform clergy were &s;plit into two parties. The <HI>court party,</HI> which furiou&s;ly railed again&s;t the Pre&s;byterians and their moderate breth|ren,&mdash;zealous bigots for the ceremonies and for pa&s;|&s;ive obedience to kings, let them be as tyrannical as they will; but carele&s;s of the in&s;truction or morals of their people. They, for forty years, were mo&s;t nu|merous, and &s;tood fair for preferment. The <HI>country party,</HI> to which Reynolds, Wilkins, Cudworth, Whichcot, Tillot&s;on, and for a time Stillingfleet, belonged, were much &s;uperior in &s;en&s;e, and grieved at the exclu&s;ion and per&s;ecution of the Pre&s;byterians.</P>
<P>Encouraged by Charles and his courtiers, and dri|ven by per&s;ecution, the Pre&s;byterians, through Man|ton, Baxter, and Calamy, be&s;ought him to devi&s;e &s;ome method of allowing them to teach his &s;ubjects obedience to him and to God. Clarendon and bi|&s;hop Sheldon of London, who mortally hated them, oppo&s;ed every degree of indulgence. Neverthele&s;s, about four months after, when Clarendon was ab&s;ent&punc; and perhaps none but real Papi&s;ts in the council&punc; Charles declared his intentions to procure a parlia+mentary indulgence for his Prote&s;tant and other &s;ub|jects, who could not in con&s;cience comply with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> e&s;tabli&s;hed religion. When the parliament met, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Commons pre&s;ented an addre&s;s again&s;t any indul+gence.
<PB N="257" REF="259">
So the Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters were left to &s;hift for them&s;elves. Baxter, Bates, Calamy, and &s;ome others attended as laymen on their pari&s;h chur|ches, before, or after they had exerci&s;ed their mi|ni&s;try in private hou&s;es. Others forbore all manner of conformity.</P>
<P>In 1663, Sheldon &s;ucceeded Juxon in the archbi|&s;hoprick of Canterbury. The courtiers, which had procured the &s;everity of the terms of conformity, as a mean of occa&s;ioning indulgence to the Papi&s;ts, in|&s;tigated the Prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters to apply for a tole|ration, hinting, that if they did not obtain it, they would be forced to the uniformity e&s;tabli&s;hed. The Independents applied; but the Pre&s;byterians know|ing that it was properly de&s;igned for the Papi&s;ts, for|bore, and thus drew on them&s;elves the frowns of both courtiers and per&s;ecuted brethren. Meanwhile, &s;ome republicans having talked too freely, it was pre|tended, that the Independents, Bapti&s;ts, and Fifth-monarchi&s;ts had formed a plot again&s;t the king.&mdash; This &s;erved for an handle of reviving the act of Eli|lizabeth condemning to bani&s;hment, and to death, in ca&s;e of return, &s;uch as peremptorily refu&s;ed atten|dance at their pari&s;h churches;&mdash;and further enact|ing, That every per&s;on, above &s;ixteen years of age, that &s;hould be pre&s;ent at any di&s;&s;enting meeting for the wor&s;hip of God, in which above four more than the family were pre&s;ent, &s;hould, for the fir&s;t offence, pay five pounds, or ly three months in pri&s;on,&mdash;for the &s;econd, pay ten pounds, or ly &s;ix months in pri|&s;on,&mdash;and for the third, pay an hundred pounds, or &s;uffer &s;even years bani&s;hment, not to return under pain of death. Married women were to ly two months in pri&s;on, unle&s;s their hu&s;bands paid two pounds for their redemption;&mdash;and the per&s;ons, in who&s;e hou&s;e the meeting was held, to be liable as other offenders. Dreadful was the execution of this act among the Prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters. If they did not immediately pay their fines, their goods were &s;eized; and if the&s;e did not &s;atisfy the law, their per&s;ons were hurried
<PB N="258" REF="260">
to pri&s;on. To make the matter &s;till wor&s;e, &s;pies and informers were placed every where, who had part of the fines for their hire. To avoid the penalty of ob|&s;tinate ab&s;enting from church, many Pre&s;byterians occa&s;ionally attended. But the Independents, Bap|ti&s;ts, and Quakers, looking upon per&s;ecution as an undoubted mark of a fal&s;e church, utterly refu&s;ed their attendance. Such was the &s;everity of the Jud|ges, that &s;ome were afraid to pray in their families, or a&s;k a ble&s;&s;ing on their meals, if above four of their friends were pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>In 1665, the plague raging in London and places about, till eight or ten thou&s;and died in a week, and about an hundred thou&s;and were cut off, mo&s;t of the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy fled, and left their people to die and be damned, as they plea&s;ed. But Me&s;&s;rs. Che&s;|ter, Janeway, Turner, Grimes, Franklin, Vincent, and other per&s;ecuted mini&s;ters, at the double hazard of their lives, from the pe&s;tilence and from their per|&s;ecutors, flew to the city, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and by preaching to multitudes, who looked for an almo&s;t immediate ap|pearance before the tribunal of God, had remarkable &s;ucce&s;s in winning of &s;ouls to Chri&s;t, and preparing them for death. In&s;tead of calling the nation to humble them&s;elves under the mighty hand of God, the parliament, which had fled to Oxford, took this opportunity to rain down their vengeance on the Pu|ritan mini&s;ters, and enacted, That they &s;hould be obliged to &s;wear, That it was unlawful to take up arms again&s;t the king, or any commi&s;&s;ioned by him, on any account; and that they would never endea|vour any alteration in the government of either church or &s;tate. And further enacted, That if, be|fore taking of this oath, they &s;hould come within five miles of the places in which they had been pa&s;|tors, or of any city, corporation, or borough, even in travelling the road, they &s;hould be fined of forty pounds for every offence; and that if they refu&s;ed this oath, they &s;hould be incapable of teaching a private &s;chool, or of boarding or dieting any per&s;ons
<PB N="259" REF="261">
to be in&s;tructed. No hone&s;t man, as Southamptch ob&s;erved, could take this oath as it &s;tood. But the Judges declaring, that by <HI>commi&s;&s;ioned</HI> by the king, was meant <HI>legally commi&s;&s;ioned;</HI> and by <HI>not endeavou|ring</HI> to alter the government, was meant <HI>not unlaw|fully endeavouring</HI> to alter it, Bates, Howe, and a|bout forty others of the Pre&s;byterian clergy took it, in that &s;en&s;e, to avoid the charge of &s;edition. But mo&s;t of the ejected mini&s;ters refu&s;ed it altogether, and were expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t terrible hard&s;hips.&mdash; Some refu&s;ed them hou&s;es, unle&s;s at extravagant rents. Others were afraid to admit them into their hou&s;es, le&s;t it &s;hould render them &s;u&s;pected. Some mini&s;ters boldly preached till they were ca&s;t into pri&s;on, choo&s;ing rather to peri&s;h in &s;uffering for Chri&s;t, than to be &s;tarved. Some of them rode thir|ty or forty miles, and preached in the night to their flocks. In&s;tigated by the informers, the &s;oldiers committed terrible outrages on their families. Next year, a fire, kindled by the Papi&s;ts, having burnt 13,200 dwelling-hou&s;es and eighty-nine churches in London, &s;everal Pre&s;byterians and Independents ventured to &s;et up meetings, the be&s;t way they could, for preaching the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Clarendon, having lo&s;t his credit at court, and be|ing &s;oon after bani&s;hed, could no more wreak his malice again&s;t the Prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters. But when Charles, in 1667, moved for a general toleration to nonconformi&s;ts, the Commons begged him to put the penal laws in execution again&s;t the conventicles, or meetings of Prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters for wor&s;hipping of God. Charles grew &s;ick of the tyrannical cruelty of Sheldon and other bi&s;hops, who adhered to the maxims of Clarendon; and blamed the indolence and mi&s;behaviour of the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy&punc; for provok|ing the Puritans to ab&s;ent from the church, and &s;et up conventicles. The mi&s;eries occa&s;ioned by the Dutch war, the decay of trade, and fears occa&s;ioned by the French inva&s;ion of the Low Countries, awake|ned &s;uch as had any con&s;cience or con&s;ideration.&mdash;
<PB N="260" REF="262">
Lord keeper Bridgeman, Judge Hale, bi&s;hops Rey|nolds and Wilkins, doctors Burton, Tillot&s;on, Stil|lingfleet, and others, thought it high time to pro|mote the peace of the church and the union of Pro|te&s;tants in the nation; and devi&s;ed a plan of compre|hen&s;ion for moderate di&s;&s;enters, and of toleration for others. Wilkins and Burton formed an overture of correction of the Books of <HI>common prayer</HI> and <HI>ordina|tion,</HI> with which Baxter, Bates, and Manton were almo&s;t plea&s;ed: and no doubt Dr. Owen and his brethren would have been glad of the three years to|leration propo&s;ed. Judge Hale prepared a Bill for the parliament an&s;werable to their agreements: but the per&s;ecuting bi&s;hops prevented its appearance, and, contrary to his maje&s;ty's inclination, revived the pro&s;ecutions again&s;t the Prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters.&mdash; As the rea&s;onablene&s;s of toleration began to be warm|ly di&s;puted without doors, S. Patrick, afterward bi|&s;hop of Ely, and many others, who courted prefer|ment, laboured by their publications to render the di&s;&s;enters odious. Parker, afterward bi&s;hop of Ox|ford, abu&s;ed them in the mo&s;t fal&s;e and virulent manner. Dr. Owen publi&s;hed a &s;ober refutation. But Andrew Marvel's <HI>rehear&s;al tran&s;pro&s;ed,</HI> went more to the quick. Its delicate though keen &s;atyre made almo&s;t every body read it. Nor do I know that it received any other reply, than by one of Parker's friends &s;ending Andrew a letter, &s;wearing, That if be printed it, his throat &s;hould be cut. But God's providence pre&s;erved him as an honour to the Hou&s;e of Commons and to his nation. The well known Sherlock abu&s;ively ridiculed the Calvini&s;t principles and experiences founded on them, and was an&s;wered by Polhill and Al&s;op. Nay, the pious behaviour, edifying &s;ermons, and even the texts of the Puritan mini&s;ters, became a leading topic of the abu&s;ive ridi|cule of the &s;tage.</P>
<P>King, queen, and court, were altogether &s;hame|le&s;s in wickedne&s;s. They went about ma&s;ked, en|tered
<PB N="261" REF="263">
into hou&s;es, and committed the vile&s;t indecen|cies and madde&s;t frolicks. Wilmot, afterwards earl of Roche&s;ter, and other uncommonly debauched profligates, were their principal favourites. What money the parliament be&s;towed upon Charles, he threw away upon his freaks and whores. Nor were the Commons niggardly of what was not theirs, but the nation's. Licentious profanene&s;s prevailed in both univer&s;ities. The harangues of the young cler|gy were &s;tuffed with encomiums on the church, and &s;atyres again&s;t the di&s;&s;enters, while the truths of the go&s;pel and practical religion were quite out of fa&s;hi|on. Regardle&s;s how many thou&s;ands or millions ran headlong to hell, in ignorance or impiety, the eccle|&s;ia&s;tical managers directed all their zeal again&s;t the Puritans. A new act was made in 1670, bearing, That every &s;uch preacher &s;hould forfeit twenty pounds for the fir&s;t offence, and forty for the &s;econd; that whoever knowingly &s;uffered conventicles in their hou&s;es or yards, &s;hould forfeit twenty pounds for each offence;&mdash;that the fines &s;hould be levied by &s;eizing and &s;elling the offender's goods, and the third part of them given to the informer; that Ju&s;tices of peace might break into any place where they were informed of a conventicle, and apprehend all the per&s;ons pre&s;ent;&mdash;that &s;uch Ju&s;tices as refu&s;ed to execute this act, &s;hould forfeit five pounds for each offence; that no defects or mi&s;takes in the warrant for apprehending &s;uch conventiclers, &s;hould render them illegal; that all clau&s;es in this act of parliament &s;hall, to the utmo&s;t, be explained in oppo&s;ition to conventicles, and &s;uch as attend them. Many Ju&s;ti|ces of peace, who had any hone&s;ty or humanity, re|&s;igned their office, rather than be concerned in exe|cuting this abominable act. Multitudes of the vile&s;t mi&s;creants commenced Informers, and what they gained by fines almo&s;t innumerable, they &s;pent in drunkenne&s;s and whoredom.

A weekly lecture was &s;et up at <HI>Pinner's Hall,</HI> in which four leading Pre&s;byterians and two Independents a+greed to preach by turns, in defence of the doctrine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the Reformation, in oppo&s;ition to Popery, Soci|niani&s;m, and infidelity. Baxter, Bates, Manton&punc; Jenkins, Drs. Owen and Collins, and afterwards Al&s;op, Howe, Cole, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> chiefly di&s;tingui&s;hed them|&s;elves at the&s;e meetings.&mdash;In the parliament 1673, Charles and Shaft&s;bury his chancellor, extolled this indulgence. But the Commons having become le&s;s tractable than their predece&s;&s;ors, held it as de&s;truc|tive to the liberties of the kingdom. None were more zealous again&s;t it, than the di&s;&s;enters. Alder|man Love, a member from the city of London, de|clared, that, notwith&s;tanding all that they had &s;uf|fered for the twelve preceding years, he and all his
<PB N="263" REF="265">
fellow Prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters would rather want their own rightful liberties, than have them in a way de|&s;tructive of the liberties of the nation, and of the Prote&s;tant cau&s;e. Charles was therefore obliged to part with his <HI>indulgence,</HI> and to call in the licences which he had given for meeting-hou&s;es. The Com|mons, perhaps affected by Love's genero&s;ity, brought in a Bill for relieving Prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters from the penalties of not coming to church, and of holding conventicles. But by the influence of the court and bi&s;hops it mi&s;carried.</P>
<P>Charles having refu&s;ed to di&s;mi&s;s the Papi&s;ts, whom he had openly admitted to places of power and tru&s;t, the Parliament, in 1675, enacted, That none, under the penalty of five hundred pounds, &s;hould hold any office of profit or tru&s;t, unle&s;s they had &s;worn the oaths of allegiance and &s;upremacy,&mdash;and had received the Lord's &s;upper in the manner of the Engli&s;h church, and &s;olemnly renounced the doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation. This act, requiring the recep|tion of the Lord's &s;upper before the mini&s;ter, church wardens, and other two credible witne&s;&s;es, as a con|dition of admi&s;&s;ion to civil offices under the crown, &s;till remains in force, to the di&s;honour of Chri&s;t and reproach of religion. By the above act, the Cabal was di&s;&s;olved, and Shaft&s;bury and Buckingham be|came advocates for the liberties of the kingdom.&mdash; Provoked with this exclu&s;ion of Papi&s;ts from places of power and tru&s;t, Charles and his courtiers labour|ed to increa&s;e the &s;everities again&s;t the di&s;&s;enters.&mdash; Their clergy were impri&s;oned, plundered, and ruined. Sheldon, by another circular letter, quickened their per&s;ecution. But the Judges were become more mild, and &s;hunned the informers, who had rendered them&s;elves odious. Multitudes of lay conformi&s;ts pitied their neighbours, when they &s;aw them impri|&s;oned and &s;poiled, for nothing but a &s;crupulous con|&s;cience, or an holy life. In vain, the court attemp|ted an act of parliament, requiring, That every voter in the election of members of parliament, and all
<PB N="264" REF="266">
members of it, or of the privy council, &s;hould &s;wear, That it is unlawful, upon any pretence what&s;oever, to take up arms again&s;t the king or tho&s;e commi&s;&s;i|oned by him; and that they &s;hould never endeavour any alteration of either church or &s;tate. Quite infu|riated with the lo&s;s of this arbitrary and en&s;laving bill, the courtiers, to their utmo&s;t, oppo&s;ed all toleration of the di&s;&s;enters, and a new encouraged the infamous informers, and inflamed the cruel per&s;ecution. Sir Roger L' E&s;trange, a mo&s;t profligate &s;coundrel, was hired to expo&s;e them from the Pre&s;s, and to encou|rage the &s;evere&s;t treatment of them, as a people who had ruined the late king, and done every thing hor|rid. While the lower clergy retailed his calumnious abu&s;e from their pulpits, the bi&s;hops oppo&s;ed every motion for accommodation of differences with the Puritans, and applied to his maje&s;ty for a more vigo|rous pro&s;ecution of the penal laws again&s;t them.</P>
<P>In 1678, a Popi&s;h plot for rendering Charles and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors ab&s;olute monarchs, and for introducti|on of the Popi&s;h religion, broke out. The parlia|ment committed five Popi&s;h Lords to the Tower; i&s;&s;ued forth a proclamation again&s;t all Papi&s;ts; and reque&s;ted the king to remove James duke of York, his brother, who had for &s;everal years profe&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf a Papi&s;t, from his per&s;on and councils. The court did all, that in them lay, to &s;tiffle the evi|dence of this Popi&s;h plot, and employed L' E&s;trange to repre&s;ent it as ridiculous. The patriots employed one Carr to publi&s;h weekly di&s;coveries of the frauds and &s;uper&s;tition of the church of Rome. But he was quickly fined and his paper prohibited by the King's Bench. Neverthele&s;s the parliament, by an act, di&s;qualified from a &s;eat with them, all &s;uch as refu&s;ed to abjure the doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation and wor&s;hip of &s;aints. To avert the odium from them&s;elves, the Papi&s;ts pretended to di&s;cover a Pre&s;|byterian plot. Dangerfield, the principal manager, having conveyed a number of &s;editious letters into one Mar&s;hal's hou&s;e, &s;ent the officers to &s;earch for
<PB N="265" REF="267">
prohibited goods, who &s;oon found the letters, he had laid fair for their hand. But they being proven counterfeits, he confe&s;&s;ed, that the Popi&s;h Lords in the Tower and others, had hired him to forge them.</P>
<P>In 1679, the parliament attempted to exclude the duke of York from &s;ucceeding to the crown, becau&s;e he was a Papi&s;t. Baffled in this, they attempted a comprehen&s;ion of the di&s;&s;enters; the Papi&s;ts being now almo&s;t able to balance all the Prote&s;tants in the kingdom. Baffled in this al&s;o, they, with no &s;mall oppo&s;ition in the Hou&s;e of Lords, repealed the &s;ta|tute of Elizabeth concerning the penalties of non-attendance upon e&s;tabli&s;hed churches. But the clerk of the crown, by Charles' &s;ecret in&s;tructions, with|drew this act, when, along with others, it &s;hould have received the royal a&s;&s;ent.&mdash;In imitation of the court, &s;ome conformi&s;t clergymen changed their wonted moderation into furious rage and per&s;ecution. In&s;tead of an IRENICUM, Stillingfleet now publi&s;h|ed his <HI>Mi&s;chief of &s;eparation;</HI> and highly condemned all the di&s;&s;enters, of the mo&s;t criminal &s;chi&s;m. He was an&s;wered by Owen, Baxter, Al&s;op, Howe, and Barret. Meanwhile, it &s;eems, Charles hired Fitz-Harris, an Iri&s;h Papi&s;t, to forge a new Pre&s;byterian plot. He &s;ent letters to the Peers, who had prote&s;t|ed for the exclu&s;ion of the duke of York from the crown, reviling the king and his family as Papi&s;ts, and calling them to take up arms again&s;t him. But the farce was di&s;covered.</P>
<P>In 1681, the parliament again attempted to ex|clude the duke of York from the throne. But Charles di&s;&s;olved them to prevent it; and notwith|&s;tanding his &s;olemn promi&s;e, never called another.&mdash; The univer&s;ity of Cambridge and many others &s;ent him flattering addre&s;&s;es in favours of arbitrary power; and &s;ome pre&s;&s;ed the vigorous execution of the penal laws again&s;t Prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters. Hence they were now per&s;ecuted with uncommon fury. Not a few of the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy, in country places, who could drink and &s;wear, as abandoned rakes, were

made Ju&s;tices of peace. They readily judged in their own cau&s;e, and fined &s;uch di&s;&s;enters as ab&s;ent|ted from their churches but a &s;ingle day. To &s;peak again&s;t Popery, was enough to make one &s;u&s;pected and reproached as a Puritan. The very Quakers, from who&s;e ho&s;tilities no body was in danger, were impri&s;oned and &s;poiled of their goods. Mo&s;t of the clergy extolled pa&s;&s;ive obedience to &s;overeigns, let them act as wickedly and tyrannically as they could. By their publi&s;hed decree, the univer&s;ity of Oxford declared it <HI>impious, &s;editious, &s;candalous, damnable, heretical, bla&s;phemous,</HI> and <HI>infamous</HI> to Chri&s;tianity it&s;elf, to maintain, <HI>That there is any original contract between the king and his &s;ubjects;</HI> or, <HI>That kings may be re&s;i&s;ted, when they &s;ubvert the con&s;titution of the king|dom, and become ab&s;olute tyrants.</HI></P>
<P>The imprudent talk of &s;ome per&s;ons in taverns, or the like, gave the courtiers an handle to pretend what they called the <HI>Rye-hou&s;e plot.</HI> By witne&s;&s;es bribed for the purpo&s;e, the earl of E&s;&s;ex, lord Ru&s;|&s;el, Algernon Sidney, Rumbold, and Houblon, were impeached as guilty. Not content with the mur|dering of the&s;e innocent patriots, the court made their own farce a rea&s;on of new cruelties again&s;t the di&s;&s;enters. Twenty young men at Newca&s;tle, were impri&s;oned a year, for meeting together for private prayer and &s;piritual conference. Meanwhile, the clergymen publi&s;hed their three and twenty Ca&s;es again&s;t di&s;&s;enters, in order to per&s;uade the world, that all the &s;everities u&s;ed again&s;t them were ju&s;t and rea&s;onable. The di&s;&s;enters were &s;hut out from their own vindication by the re&s;triction of the Pre&s;s. More daring than &s;ome others, Tho. de Laune, an Anabapti&s;t &s;choolma&s;ter, when publicly challenged for an an&s;wer by Dr. Calamy, a furious conformi&s;t, publi&s;hed his &s;en&s;ible <HI>Plea for the nonconformi&s;ts,</HI> and on that account, was ca&s;t into pri&s;on, where, notwith|&s;tanding all he could do for relief, he continued till he and his wife and two children peri&s;hed of hunger and cold, or the like.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="269">In 1685, Charles died, not without &s;trong &s;u&s;pi|cious of poi&s;on from Popi&s;h hands, for the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of who&s;e religion he was thought not &s;uffici|ently zealous and active. James duke of York, a bigotted Papi&s;t, &s;ucceeded him, and &s;olemnly engag|ed to pre&s;erve the government of both church and &s;tate. As if &s;uch a &s;overeign had been an ine&s;tima|ble ble&s;&s;ing, the conformi&s;ts pulpits, all over the nation, rang with thank&s;givings; and all the coun|ties &s;ent up their ful&s;ome addre&s;&s;es. The univer&s;ity of Oxford, in the mo&s;t unlimited manner, declared, That it was impo&s;&s;ible to move them from an unli|mited &s;ubjection to all his commands. His parlia|ment procured to his liking by bribery and other too common arts, &s;ettled two millions &s;terling yearly up|on him, that he might never be embarra&s;&s;ed for want of money, as his brother and father had been; and they be&s;ought his vigorous execution of the laws a|gain&s;t the Prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters. The per&s;ecution was revived; and occa&s;ion was taken from Monmouth Charles' ba&s;tard &s;on-in-law's invading the kingdom, to make it more and more terrible. The royal army in the We&s;t lived on the people at free quarter.&mdash; Colonel Kirk cau&s;ed a number of pri&s;oners, without any trial, to be hung up for diver&s;ion, while he and his companions drank and danced be&s;ide the gibbets. Jefferies, now Chief Ju&s;tice, who&s;e &s;avage temper had been &s;ufficiently manife&s;ted, was appointed judge in the We&s;tern circuit. Alway drunk, or in a fury, he raged among the poor people as an ab&s;olute infer|nal. By repeated confinements, he forced juries to bring in people <HI>guilsy,</HI> whether they had proof, or believed them guilty, or not. He per&s;uaded many of the pri&s;oners to plead guilty, in hopes of a pardon, and then ordered them to be executed immediately, without having a moment for recommending their &s;ouls to God. About &s;ix hundred were hanged, and the quarters of two or three hundred were fixed on trees and gibbets by the way &s;ides, to the great an|noyance of travellers. He &s;old a multitude of par|dons,

from the rate of ten to fourteen thou&s;and gui|neas a piece. By &s;uch methods, &s;ome di&s;&s;enters were forced into the church, and multitudes fled to Holland or America; and Spademan, Ra&s;tric, Bur|roughs, Scoffin, Quipp, and other conforming cler|gymen, were, by the power of con&s;cientious convic|tions, forced from the church, to join the per&s;ecut|ed di&s;&s;enters.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the Popi&s;h party mightily increa&s;ed.&mdash; Multitudes of Je&s;uits and regular prie&s;ts were invited from abroad. Je&s;uitical &s;eminaries of learning were erected in London and in the country. Ma&s;s-cha|pels were erected in almo&s;t every con&s;iderable town. Four Popi&s;h bi&s;hops were con&s;ecrated in the royal chapel. Multitudes of tracts for &s;educing people to Popery were publi&s;hed. Multitudes frequented the Popi&s;h chapels, as that, and zeal for James' ab&s;olute power were the &s;ole road to preferments. All the &s;ubjects were prohibited to &s;peak di&s;re&s;pectfully of his maje&s;ty's religion. At la&s;t, &s;ome conformi&s;ts o|pened their eyes, and began to preach again&s;t Popery. James prohibited the inferior clergy to touch upon controverted points of religion. Hereupon Drs. Til|lot&s;on, Stillingfleet, Tenni&s;on, Patrick, Wake, Whit|by, Sharp, Atterbury, and others, began to copy the example, which the di&s;&s;enters had &s;et them, &s;ome years before, in their <HI>morning exerci&s;es,</HI> and pu|bli&s;hed a number of &s;en&s;ible di&s;cour&s;es again&s;t the principal corruptions of Popery. It &s;eems, that Richard Baxter, and &s;ome other nonconformi&s;ts, offered to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in writing on the&s;e points.&mdash; But their productions were not allowed to be print|ed. The e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy did not appear fond of their help; nor had they proper acce&s;s to the books nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch work; nor would it have been pru|dent to have provoked James beyond what they had done, in refu&s;ing to concur in the repeal of the <HI>Te&s;t Act.</HI> Provoked with the conformi&s;ts oppo&s;ition to his religion, James declared again&s;t the cruelty of
<PB N="269" REF="271">
the church of England. And, encouraged by the Judges, who interpreted the laws, he, by his ab&s;olute di&s;pen&s;ing power, granted an <HI>indulgence</HI> to the di&s;&s;en|ters, courted their affection, and encouraged them to &s;et up their conventicles. They improved this opportunity of preaching the go&s;pel, but had no good opinion of his end in granting it.</P>
<P>After a con&s;tant per&s;ecution of twenty &s;ix years, the extremity of the Puritans &s;ufferings now came to an end. About &s;ixty thou&s;and had &s;uffered much on religious accounts. Five, if not rather about ten, thou&s;and had peri&s;hed in pri&s;ons. Of the Quakers alone, three hundred and fifty died in jail, and a|bout fourteen hundred were now relea&s;ed. Multi|tudes had retired to America, Holland, <HI>&amp;c:</HI> never|thele&s;s, the number of remaining di&s;&s;enters was much the &s;ame as at the beginning of the per&s;ecution.&mdash; Their firmne&s;s and con&s;tancy in &s;ufferings convinced the world, that they were not governed by humour, but by con&s;cience. Their &s;ermons, being plain and practical, had no &s;mall &s;ucce&s;s: their morals were remarkably an&s;werable to the commandments of Chri&s;t: they had carefully trained up their children their own way, and laboured to impre&s;s their minds with a &s;en&s;e of religion. They &s;tudied to keep up a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of faithful mini&s;ters. The&s;e things, to|gether with the per&s;ecuting rage and licentious be|haviour of the conformi&s;ts, made the numbers of Pu|ritans continue amid&s;t all their temporal di&s;courage|ments.</P>
<P>James and his prie&s;ts being thoroughly enraged a|gain&s;t their conformi&s;t oppo&s;ers, he appointed com|mi&s;&s;ioners all over the kingdom, to enquire into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;s &s;u&s;tained by the di&s;&s;enters, that their per&s;ecutors might be obliged to refund it. The informers, jud|ges, and many others, laid their account with imme|diate ruin. But the Puritans generally concealed their injuries, when it was in their power to have them revenged, and their lo&s;s refunded. By the ad|vice of chancellor Je&s;&s;eries, and contrary to a &s;tand|ing
<PB N="270" REF="272">
law of 1641, and to James' own &s;ubjection to the Pope, a new <HI>High Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> was erected to vi&s;it the nation, reform the di&s;orders of the church, and pu|ni&s;h clerical offenders with &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, deprivation, excommunication, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Sancroft, archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury, was afraid to act in this terrible work. But the bi&s;hops of Durham and Roche&s;ter, Jefferies him|&s;elf, the earl of Sunderland, Herbert, and Wright, chief Ju&s;tices, and Fenner, recorder of London, &s;ome of them profe&s;&s;ed Papi&s;ts, were not &s;o &s;queami&s;h.&mdash; The univer&s;ities of Cambridge and Oxford were com|manded to fill up their vacancies with &s;candalous Popi&s;h fellows and governors; but they ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>By his ab&s;olute power, James now publi&s;hed a <HI>de|claration</HI> of his intentions, or rather a <HI>promi&s;e</HI> to pro|tect the church of England, as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed,&mdash; and to grant a toleration in religion to all his &s;ubjects, and to aboli&s;h all penal laws again&s;t di&s;&s;enters,&mdash;or impo&s;ition of oaths or te&s;ts upon &s;uch as held public employments. The Bapti&s;ts, Quakers, Independents, and Pre&s;byterians, thanked him for his favour, but promi&s;ed no ab&s;olute obedience. Notwith&s;tanding the pre&s;ence of two courtiers, mo&s;t of the Pre&s;byte|rian clergy, at their general meeting, &s;eemed willing rather to forfeit their liberty granted, than declare for his maje&s;ty's power. Sir James Shorter mayor of London, declined his freedom from the Te&s;t, and from conformity to the Engli&s;h church, which di&s;plea&s;ed the king. Lobb an Independent mini&s;ter, Penn the Quaker, and &s;ome few other di&s;&s;enters, complied not a little with James and his courtiers mea&s;ures: but the bulk of the di&s;&s;enters &s;tood off; and not|with&s;tanding all that the court could do, refu&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the de&s;truction of tho&s;e that had &s;o long per|&s;ecuted them. The&s;e per&s;ecutors now implored their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and promi&s;ed a redre&s;s of their grie|vances, as &s;oon as their common danger from Po|pery &s;hould blow over. Some of the bi&s;hops waited upon the leaders of the di&s;&s;enting clergy, and be|&s;ought
<PB N="271" REF="273">
them to u&s;e their influence with their party to &s;tand aloof from the court; in doing which, they might a&s;&s;uredly expect redre&s;s of their burdens, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. The Marquis of Halifax, by advice of the church dignitaries, repre&s;ented to the di&s;&s;en|ters, That they had no ground to tru&s;t the Papi&s;ts, and that they ought not to pro&s;ecute their re&s;entment at the expence of the public &s;afety; and that they might &s;ee, how the conformi&s;ts re&s;entment had brought them&s;elves to the brink of ruin. About twenty thou&s;and copies of this letter were di&s;per&s;ed, and had a very good effect.</P>
<P>The rupture between James and the church of England having become quite open and manife&s;t, both parties prepared for their own defence. By turning out magi&s;trates and placing others in their room, according to the powers claimed by him in the new charters, and by di&s;placing &s;uch officers in the kingdom as di&s;liked his ab&s;olute power, and by a tour through the country to ingratiate him&s;elf with his people, James laboured to procure a parliament for repealing the penal &s;tatutes concerning religion. Mild methods not &s;ucceeding to his wi&s;h, he aban|doned him&s;elf to the direction of his furious Po|pi&s;h prie&s;ts; made father Petre, one of them, his prime mini&s;ter, intending to make him archbi&s;hop of York, and a cardinal of the Holy Conclave. &mdash; The earl of Ca&s;tlemain was di&s;patched amba&s;&s;ador to Rome, and the Pope's nuncio received a &s;olemn au|dience at Wind&s;or, notwith&s;tanding the law of Hen|ry VIII. &s;till made it trea&s;on to corre&s;pond with his Holine&s;s. Parker, bi&s;hop of Oxford, was employed to publi&s;h rea&s;ons of abrogating the Te&s;t. In his performance he &s;aid what he could to excu&s;e tran|&s;ub&s;tantiation, and to clear the Papi&s;ts from the charge of idolatry. But a &s;mart reply by Dr. Bur|net, &s;unk the reputation of Parker. In Ireland, every thing was modelled for an immediate intro|duction of Popery. In England, James was bu&s;y at the like work. Prote&s;tant officers were turned out
<PB N="272" REF="274">
of the army. Port&s;mouth and Hull, the principal ports of the kingdom, were committed to Papi&s;ts. Iri&s;h Papi&s;ts came over in multitudes. Some regi|ments being formed only of Papi&s;ts, and &s;carcely a troop or company without &s;ome placed in them by order from court, the army was brought to Black-heath, to awe the city of London and the parliament.</P>
<P>There being &s;till danger from a Prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;|&s;or, as Mary his elde&s;t daughter had been married to William prince of Orange, &s;on of Mary, daughter of Charles I. James wrote her a letter for per&s;uading her to embrace his Popi&s;h religion, and employed one James Stewart a Scotch lawyer, to cau&s;e Fagel, William's principal confident, labour to promote his conver&s;ion to Popery, or at lea&s;t his approbation of the repeal of the penal laws again&s;t it. William and Mary's an&s;wers giving James no ground to expect their conver&s;ion, he re&s;olved to have a new heir to his crown, by his long barren queen. The Je&s;uits pretences, that &s;he obtained this child by a vow to the virgin Mary of Loretto, and their predictions that it would be a prince,&mdash;together with the total neglect of the requi&s;ite proofs of the queen's pregnancy and delivery, and many other &s;u&s;picious circum&s;tances, made mo&s;t of the Prote&s;tants in the nation believe it an impo&s;ture. Encouraged by the hopes of an un|born &s;ucce&s;&s;or, James, in April 1688, by his ab&s;olute power over all laws, publi&s;hed his <HI>&s;econd declaration</HI> for liberty of con&s;cience, and appointed the bi&s;hops to cau&s;e it to be read from every pulpit, during the time of divine wor&s;hip. Crew of Durham, Barlow of Lincoln, Cartwright of Che&s;ter, Wood of Litchfield, Walters of St. David's, Sprat of Roche&s;ter, Parker of Oxford, and Herbert of Hereford complied; and all but Herbert returned their ful&s;om addre&s;&s;es of thanks to James. Eighteen bi&s;hops, and the chiefs of their clergy refu&s;ed to publi&s;h it; &s;o that it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ead in no more than about 200 churches, &s;even of them in London. Sancroft of Canterbury, Loyd of St. A&s;aph, Ken of Bath and Wells, Turner of Ely, Lake of Chi|che&s;ter,
<PB N="273" REF="275">
White of Peterborough, and Trelawney of Bri&s;tol, in an addre&s;s to James, attempted to ju&s;tify their not publi&s;hing his Declaration, as they could not but think the <HI>di&s;pen&s;ing</HI> power contrary to the laws of the land. For their pre&s;umption they were &s;ent to the Tower; which indeed they richly de|&s;erved on another account, as they had for twenty-&s;even years laboured to e&s;tabli&s;h kings arbitrary pow|er and pa&s;&s;ive obedience to it, till it came to be turn|ed again&s;t them&s;elves. Upon the 29th of June, af|ter a trial of ten hours, the&s;e bi&s;hops, to James' in|expre&s;&s;ible vexation, but to the joy of the city and part of the army, were acquitted.</P>
<P>Finding that Mary his prince&s;s was now excluded from the Briti&s;h crown by an heir, who&s;e royal birth was at be&s;t extremely doubtful, William began to li&s;ten more attentively to the many invitations he re|ceived from England, be&s;eeching him to come over and deliver the nation from Popery and &s;lavery.&mdash; Lewis XIV. of France informed James of his &s;on-in-law's intention to invade his kingdom, and offered him fifteen thou&s;and troops, or more, if nece&s;&s;ary, to with&s;tand him. But the earl of Sunderland, who had been lately converted to Popery, per&s;uaded him not to accept of the&s;e offered troops, as it would make all the Prote&s;tants believe that he intended an overthrow of their religion and liberties. Per&s;uaded of William's intentions to invade his kingdom, James, to regain the favour of his Prote&s;tant &s;ubjects, i&s;&s;ued forth warrants for calling a parliament;&mdash;by advice of the bi&s;hops, took off the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the bi&s;hop of London, which had been inflicted for his refu&s;ing to &s;u&s;pend Dr. Sharp for preaching again&s;t Popery, before he had tried him;&mdash;di&s;&s;olved the eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ion; re&s;tored the charter of London, and the fellows of Magdalen college at Oxford; and re|nounced &s;everal other illegal practices. But he no &s;ooner heard, that William's &s;leet was di&s;per&s;ed by a &s;torm, than he &s;topt his redre&s;&s;ing of grievances.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="276">UPON Nov. 1&s;t, William again put to &s;ea with fourteen thou&s;and men; and on the 5th landed at Torbay in the &s;outh of England, the wind having almo&s;t miraculou&s;ly favoured him, and re&s;trained James' fleet. He publi&s;hed a <HI>Declaration,</HI> in which he enumerated the grievances of the nation, relative to religion and liberty, and the fruitle&s;s attempts which had been made to have them redre&s;&s;ed;&mdash;and prote&s;ted, that his intention in his expedition was to procure a free parliament, in which the&s;e grievances might be redre&s;&s;ed, and an agreement e&s;tabli&s;hed be|tween the church of England and the Prote&s;tant di&s;|&s;enters.&mdash;Finding by this declaration, that William had been invited by not only nobles and others, but al&s;o by a number of the bi&s;hops, and that they re|fu&s;ed to declare their dete&s;tation of his inva&s;ion, James placed all his hopes in his army, which he endeavour|ed to &s;trengthen from Scotland, and e&s;pecially from Ireland, in &s;o much that many in Britain were afraid of a new Popi&s;h ma&s;&s;acre. This fright being over, the London mob pulled down the Popi&s;h chapels.&mdash; Father Petre, with &s;hoals of Je&s;uits and prie&s;ts, who had flocked about the court, fled out of the king|dom. Several of James' mini&s;ters of arbitrary power left him, and concealed them&s;elves. Jefferies was apprehended in a &s;ailor's habit, and would have been torn to pieces by the mob, had not a &s;trong guard e|&s;corted him to the Tower, where he died, before he came to his trial. When William came to Exeter, many of the nobility &s;igned an a&s;&s;ociation, in which they promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the pur&s;uance of his declaration, and to revenge whatever attempt &s;hould be made on his per&s;on. Finding that &s;o many of his nobles and part of his army had gone over to his &s;on-in-law; that Anne his younger daughter and her hu&s;band prince George of Denmark had left him; and that the univer&s;ity of Oxford, archbi&s;hop San|croft, and &s;even or eight other bi&s;hops, had &s;igned the above mentioned a&s;&s;ociation,&mdash;James, after not a

little perplexity, contempt, and abu&s;e, followed his queen into France. When William came to London, many of the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy, and about ninety di&s;|&s;enters in a body, pre&s;ented their congratulatory ad|dre&s;&s;es to him, and were graciou&s;ly received. When he and Mary his con&s;ort were enthroned, the di&s;&s;en|ters pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to each of them, which were favourably accepted. And indeed, during their whole reign, the di&s;&s;enters were their mo&s;t hearty and &s;tea|dy friends.</P>
<P>Many of the clerical conformi&s;ts now behaved in a mo&s;t &s;hocking manner. After they had long prea|ched up the unlimited power of the king, and en|couraged the impo&s;ition of oaths acknowledging it, they plainly &s;hewed, that they regarded it only &s;o far as it was exerci&s;ed to &s;upport them&s;elves. After they had &s;educed James into his extravagancies, they left him to peri&s;h in his ruins. After they had &s;olemnly engaged to &s;upport William, they almo&s;t con&s;tantly laboured to compa&s;s the ruin of his per&s;on and go|vernment. Sancroft of Canterbury, Loyd of Nor|wich, Turner of Ely, Frampton of Glouce&s;ter, Tho|mas of Worce&s;ter, Lake of Chiche&s;ter, and White of Peterborough, refu&s;ed to &s;wear allegiance to him. Many, who did &s;wear it, by their di&s;tinction between a king <HI>de facto</HI> and one <HI>de jure,</HI> plainly manife&s;ted, that they &s;ubmitted to William and Mary as mere u&s;urpers, whom they thought it their duty to pull down, if ever they could. No &s;ooner was their dan|ger from the Papi&s;ts over, than they ca&s;t all their kind promi&s;es to di&s;&s;enters at their heels, and appear|ed as ready to per&s;ecute them as ever. The eight bi&s;hops above mentioned, pretended to move for a comprehen&s;ion of &s;ome di&s;&s;enters, and for a tolera|on of the re&s;t, and meanwhile in&s;tigated their friends to oppo&s;e it, and to repre&s;ent the promoters of it as enemies to the church. The bigotted clergy threa|tened their moderate brethren with a new &s;eparation, if any important mitigation of the terms of commu|nion were allowed to the di&s;&s;enters; and by that
<PB N="276" REF="278">
means deterred them from correcting the Book of common prayer, le&s;t the&s;e zealots, by adhering to the old form of it, &s;hould draw over the body of the nation to their &s;ide.</P>
<P>When king William came to his fir&s;t parliament, 1689, he recommended the exclu&s;ion of Papi&s;ts from all places of power or tru&s;t, and the unhampered ad|mi&s;&s;ion of all his Prote&s;tant &s;ubjects. Some members moved, that the receiving of the Lord's &s;upper, at lea&s;t in the manner of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, &s;hould not be held a nece&s;&s;ary qualification for a civil office: but the contrary was carried. The di&s;pen&s;ing with <HI>kneeling</HI> at the Lord's &s;upper, or <HI>cro&s;&s;ing</HI> in bapti&s;m, and an allowance for per&s;ons to explain <HI>a&s;&s;ent</HI> and <HI>con&s;ent,</HI> in their &s;ub&s;cription of the <HI>Thirty-nine arti|cles,</HI> were refu&s;ed in the Hou&s;e of Lords.&mdash;An act of <HI>toleration</HI> for all Prote&s;tants, except Socinians, by which they were exempted from the penalties of nonconformity, providing they take the oaths to the government, and &s;ub&s;cribe the doctrinal articles of the Engli&s;h church, was got carried, but with great difficulty.</P>
<P>During the dependence of the above acts in parlia|ment, a motion was made in the Hou&s;e of Lords, for a comprehen&s;ion of the moderate di&s;&s;enters, and a removal of the&s;e things at which they principally &s;crupled. Some moved, that, as under Henry VIII. and Edward VI. a mixed committee of clergymen and laymen, &s;hould prepare the draught of correcti|ons and terms of agreement. This motion was re|jected by a &s;mall majority. Burnet laments, that he oppo&s;ed it for fear of offending the e&s;tabli&s;hed cler|gy. By the advice of Dr. Tillot&s;on, king William referred it to a Synod of clergymen, that their body might the more readily receive it, and the Papi&s;ts have le&s;s handle of objecting again&s;t it. Lamplugh archbi&s;hop of York, Loyd, Sprat, Burnet, and &s;ix other bi&s;hops,&mdash;Stillingfleet, Tillot&s;on, Sharp, Be|veridge, Scot, Grove, Patrick, Kidder, Tenni&s;on, Fowler, and ten other divines, were appointed to
<PB N="277" REF="279">
meet and prepare &s;uch alterations of the <HI>liturgy</HI> and <HI>canons,</HI>&mdash;and to frame overtures for the reformation of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts,&mdash;and to con&s;ider every other like matter, which might tend to the peace and welfare of the church. Bi&s;hops Mew and Sprat, and two divines withdrew, that they might have no hand in relieving the di&s;&s;enters. Some who remain|ed, pled, That making of alterations upon the con&s;ti|tutions of the church for gratifying an ob&s;tinate and peevi&s;h party, would but render them more in&s;olent, would occa&s;ion a rent in the church, and make peo|ple di&s;e&s;teem the liturgy, which needed correction. &mdash;Neverthele&s;s, the committee fini&s;hed their work, and agreed, That certain parts of canonical &s;cripture be read in place of the apocryphal le&s;&s;ons; and that the Athana&s;ian creed might be omitted, and that a|&s;cribed to the apo&s;tles u&s;ed in&s;tead of it. They drew up new collects more agreeable to the epi&s;tles and go&s;pels. Kidder formed a new ver&s;ion of the P&s;alms from the Hebrew. They &s;ub&s;tituted more plain and &s;afe expre&s;&s;ions in&s;tead of tho&s;e which had been ex|cepted again&s;t in the liturgy. They agreed, That the &s;inging of God's prai&s;e by mu&s;ical in&s;truments in ca|thedrals, be laid a&s;ide; that legendary &s;aints days &s;hould be omitted in the Calendar, and not ob&s;erv|ed; that the u&s;e of the <HI>cro&s;s</HI> in bapti&s;m, and of <HI>god|fathers</HI> and <HI>godmothers</HI> be left to the option of pa|rents; that <HI>kneeling</HI> in the Lord's &s;upper be left in|different; that the u&s;e of the <HI>&s;urplice</HI> be left indiffe|rent, and at the di&s;cretion of the bi&s;hop of the dio|ce&s;e; that the re-ordination of &s;uch as have been ordained by pre&s;byters be only conditional; that the name of <HI>prie&s;t</HI> be changed into that of <HI>mini&s;ter,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. The&s;e alterations would have probably brought in three fourths of the di&s;&s;enters to the e&s;tabli&s;hed church. But the bulk of the clergy reli&s;hed no &s;uch conde&s;cen&s;ions. While the committee were employ|ed in their work, many rai&s;ed a terrible outcry, That king William and his agents, intended to pull down Epi&s;copacy, and &s;et up Pre&s;bytery. The univer&s;ities
<PB N="278" REF="280">
of Oxford and Cambridge furiou&s;ly declared them|&s;elves again&s;t all alterations; and that &s;uch as pro|moted them were undoubted enemies to the church.</P>
<P>Care was taken to appoint &s;uch members for the convocation, as would &s;o judge of the work of the committee, as to put an end to all attempts of alte|rations. When they met, K. William de&s;ired them to con&s;ider what he had to lay before them, with due and impartial zeal for the welfare of the church. But the lower Hou&s;e at the fir&s;t re&s;olved to enter on no debate relative to the Book of common prayer and Con&s;titutions of their church. They had &s;carce|ly temper enough to thank his maje&s;ty for his promi|&s;ed protection of them and their church. Nor could the bi&s;hops bring them to acknowledge any Chri&s;tian fellow&s;hip with the Prote&s;tant churches abroad, as had been done in the addre&s;s of the upper Hou&s;e.&mdash; Finding the Lower Hou&s;e behave in this furious manner, William di&s;&s;olved their meeting; and &s;ince they were in no temper to do good, he, by pro|roguing their a&s;&s;emblies, re&s;trained them from doing any hurt for ten years to come. The &s;ettlement of Pre&s;bytery in Scotland was improved by the&s;e mad zealots, as an handle for calumniating his maje&s;ty, and oppo&s;ing all conde&s;cen&s;ion toward the di&s;&s;enters.</P>
<P>Terrible was now the contention between the E|pi&s;copalian clergy that took the oaths of <HI>allegiance</HI> and <HI>&s;upremacy</HI> to K. William, and &s;uch as did not. The <HI>Nonjurants</HI> repre&s;ented their opponents as men who had trampled on their con&s;ciences for the &s;ake of preferment,&mdash;and pretended, That the impo&s;ition of the oath warranted them to &s;eparate from their brethren; that they had their &s;piritual authority from Chri&s;t, and could not be deprived of it by the civil powers,&mdash;and &s;o were &s;till bound to take care of the &s;ouls of their people. The <HI>Jurants</HI> replied, That they were &s;chi&s;matics, in &s;eparating from the church; that though the &s;tate had deprived them of their livings, they ought not to revenge it upon the church, in a &s;chi&s;matical withdrawment from her
<PB N="279" REF="281">
communion; and that magi&s;trates may lawfully de|prive clergymen of their extrin&s;ical power of exer|ci&s;ing their mini&s;try. All along from the reformati|on, and e&s;pecially for near 30 years pa&s;t, the Epi&s;co|palian clergy had maintained the power of princes in eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es, and an unlimited pa&s;&s;ive obedi|ence to them. But now the High Church party re|fu&s;ed to admit of his maje&s;ty's power in &s;piritual cau&s;es; and both they and the Williamites gave up with their doctrine of pa&s;&s;ive obedience.</P>
<P>Having now lo&s;t hopes of acce&s;s to the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, the bulk of the Pre&s;byterians and Indepen|dents formed a plan of concord between them&s;elves, bearing, That all who are united to Chri&s;t, are mem|bers of his catholic invi&s;ible church, and all vi&s;ible believers and their children members of the vi&s;ible; that &s;ocieties of vi&s;ible believers, who, under Chri&s;t, &s;tatedly join together for communion in all the ordi|nances of the go&s;pel, are particular churches; that none ought to be admitted as members to all &s;ealing ordinances, but &s;uch as know and believe the funda|mental truths of the go&s;pel, and are of blamele&s;s lives, marked with vi&s;ible godline&s;s and hone&s;ty; that a competent number of vi&s;ible &s;aints become the &s;ubjects of &s;tated church fellow&s;hip, upon their agreement to walk together according to go&s;pel rules; that though parochial churches are not of divine in&s;titution, yet, for edification, the members of a particular church ought to live as contiguou&s;ly as po&s;&s;ible; that every particular church hath a right to choo&s;e their own pa&s;tors; and being furni&s;hed with them, hath authority from Chri&s;t for the exer|ci&s;e of government, and di&s;pen&s;ation of ordinances within it&s;elf; that in admini&s;trating church power, it belongs to officers to rule, and to the brotherhood to con&s;ent; that all Chri&s;tians, as they have oppor|tunity, ought to join, and &s;tedfa&s;tly continue in com|munion with &s;ome particular church; that the mi|ni&s;terial office is appointed by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the gathering, edification and government of his church,
<PB N="280" REF="282">
till the end of the world; that &s;uch as are called or admitted to the mini&s;terial office, ought to be marked with proper gifts, grace, and holy conver&s;ation;&mdash; that in ordinary ca&s;es, none ought to be ordained pa&s;tors, but in relation to &s;ome particular church; that it is proper, that the pa&s;tors of neighbouring congregations be con&s;ulted in the calling of mini&s;ters, and a&s;&s;i&s;t at their ordination; that it is proper, that the gifts of candidates for preaching the go&s;pel be tried by pa&s;tors, and that they be &s;ent forth with &s;olemn approbation and prayer; that in every church admonitions and excommunications of &s;candalous per&s;ons ought to have place; that in order to pro|mote the communion of churches, all the members ought to walk Chri&s;tianly towards one another,&mdash;no church ought to u&s;urp authority over one another, nor to decoy members from another, or to blame the proceedings of another, till it hath had an opportu|nity of defending it&s;elf,&mdash;and every one ought rea|dily to give account of its procedure, in order to prevent offence; that deacons, who take care of the poor, are appointed by Chri&s;t; that no breach ought to be made with re&s;pect to the in&s;titution of ruling elders; that Synods ought to be held at lea&s;t for con&s;ultation about church affairs, and their deci&s;ions to be received with reverence, and none to di&s;&s;ent from them, without apparent ground from the word of God; that all men ought to pray for, obey, and &s;upport civil magi&s;trates.</P>
<P>They agreed pretty well in condemning the ex|pre&s;&s;ions of Davis of Rothwel, &s;undry of which bor|dered on Antinomiani&s;m or Anabapti&s;m; but &s;oon fell into a terrible flame of contention relative to &s;ome of the di&s;tingui&s;hed truths of the go&s;pel. For almo&s;t forty years preceding, Richard Baxter had been attempting to form a medley of Calvini&s;tical and Arminian doctrines, particularly concerning our redemption by Chri&s;t and ju&s;tification before God, and had been refuted by Dr. Owen, Crandon, Brown, and many others. Neverthele&s;s, his fame of piety
<PB N="281" REF="283">
and penetration had decoyed mo&s;t of the Engli&s;h Pre&s;byterians to his &s;ide. In 1690, the &s;ermons of the eminently pious Dr. Cri&s;p, who had flouri&s;hed about fifty years before, and had been blamed for ap|proaching too near Antinomiani&s;m, were re-publi&s;hed by his &s;on. Several mini&s;ters atte&s;ted, that they be|lieved the additional &s;ermons to be genuine. This atte&s;tation was pretended to be a countenancing of their contents. Mr. Williams publi&s;hed his <HI>Go&s;pel truth &s;tated and vindicated,</HI> in which he attempted to refute &s;everal po&s;itions laid down by Dr. Cri&s;p. As he &s;teered a middle cour&s;e betwixt Baxteriani&s;m and Calvini&s;m, or rather refined upon Baxter, it was not difficult to procure a &s;olemn approbation of his book from clergymen of his acquaintance. But it was re|futed with great warmth by I&s;aac Chauncey, in his <HI>Neonomiani&s;m unma&s;ked.</HI> Robert Trail al&s;o publi&s;hed a letter in vindication of the Prote&s;tant doctrine of ju&s;tification through the imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t alone, and of the practi&s;ers and profe&s;&s;ors of it, from the unju&s;t charge of Antinomiani&s;m.</P>
<P>Great pains were taken by &s;ome to heal this un|happy breach, which hindered the &s;ucce&s;s of the go&s;pel, and mightily plea&s;ed the conformi&s;t enemies of both parties. But by mutual reproaches it was more and more widened. A breach was made in the lecture at <HI>Pinner's Hall.</HI> Nothing le&s;s than the ex|clu&s;ion of Williams could &s;atisfy his opponents.&mdash; Bates, Howe, and Al&s;op, who were all inclined to his &s;entiments, went off with him. Mead and T. Cole remained, and had four others added in place of tho&s;e that went off. Mather, Lobb, Goodwin, and others, appeared in oppo&s;ition to Williams' &s;cheme of the go&s;pel being a <HI>new law,</HI> and his de|nial of a <HI>legal change of per&s;on</HI> between the elect and Chri&s;t as their &s;urety. Lobb appealed to Stilling|fleet, now bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, and to Dr. John Edwards, both of whom favoured Dr. Williams' &s;cheme. After the two parties, by hot debates, of &s;everal years continuance, had rendered them&s;elves
<PB N="282" REF="284">
a reproach, they, in &s;ome &s;ort, referred their diffe|rences to Herman Wit&s;ius, a Dutch profe&s;&s;or of divinity. To compo&s;e them, he publi&s;hed his <HI>Ani|madver&s;iones Irenicae,</HI> in which he, with great can|dour, meekne&s;s, and preci&s;ion, pointed out the truth, and reproved the ill-guarded expre&s;&s;ions of them that held it. He &s;hewed, That all the &s;ins of elect men, being laid upon, borne, and &s;atisfied for, by Chri&s;t, as their &s;urety, there behoved to be an exchange of per&s;ons between him and them in law-reckoning; that though Chri&s;t bore the &s;ins of his people, not not only during his la&s;t &s;ufferings, but in his whole &s;tate of humiliation, he ought not to be repre&s;ented as a <HI>&s;inner, bla&s;phemer, adulterer,</HI> &amp;c. or as abomi|nable to, and abdicated by, his Father; that, tho' Chri&s;t ab&s;olutely and unconditionally purcha&s;ed e|ternal redemption for all his elect, yet his righte|ou&s;ne&s;s is not imputed to their per&s;ons, till the mo|ment of their regeneration and &s;piritual unition to him; that though Chri&s;t and his elect were legally united together from all eternity, that their &s;ins might be laid on him and &s;atisfaction demanded from him in the fulne&s;s of time, yet their my&s;tical union is not begun till he apprehend them by his Spirit, nor compleated till they receive him by faith; that Chri&s;t's holine&s;s of nature and life under the law, as well as his &s;atisfactory &s;ufferings, are imputed by God to all believers, which con&s;titute them perfectly holy and righteous in law-reckoning before him, as their infinitely exact Judge; that men's ju&s;tification before God in no re&s;pect depends upon any kind of works of theirs, nor on faith, which is, and nece&s;&s;arily pro|duceth good works, as a work, as a condition or di&s;|po&s;ing cau&s;e, but merely as an in&s;trument of receiv|ing Chri&s;t and his righteou&s;ne&s;s and ju&s;tification thro' it; that though many true believers have not any bold confidence, that Chri&s;t and his &s;alvation are theirs in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, yet faith, in it&s;elf, is a mo&s;t firm per&s;ua&s;ion of one's own particular right to Chri&s;t and all his &s;aving benefits; and this per&s;ua&s;ion is weak
<PB N="283" REF="285">
or &s;trong, as faith it&s;elf is in the heart; that repen|tance, in the root of it, being coeval with the habit of faith, may be &s;aid to precede actual pardon of &s;in, as well as faith; that, though all the &s;ins of believers, pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and to come, be fully and irrevocably pardoned in their ju&s;tification, on account of which, God, as a legal judge, can &s;ee no &s;in in them, in order to condemnation, yet, as an omni|&s;cient and holy Father, he &s;ees much &s;in in them to be highly di&s;plea&s;ed with them, and which excee|dingly hurts and defiles them,&mdash;and therefore they ought to be burdened with, confe&s;s, and mourn o|ver it, and pray for the pardon of it; that though Chri&s;t's &s;urety-righteou&s;ne&s;s be the only proper con|dition of the covenant of grace, yet the Lord hath appointed faith to be the mean of his elect's entrance into the actual enjoyment of the ble&s;&s;ing of it; that though our graces and good works are of no avail as the condition of our ju&s;tification before God, nay, as dwelling in our &s;inful nature, and proceeding from us, are but as lo&s;s, dung, and filthy rags before him as a judge, yet as proceeding from the Holy Gho&s;t, and accepted through Chri&s;t, they are of great u&s;e as a preparation for heaven, and as means of averting God's judgments, and drawing his delights and be|nefits on us, as his friends and children in Chri&s;t; that the law of God, as a covenant of works, and as a Rule of life, and the go&s;pel, particularly as <HI>&s;trictly taken,</HI> ought to be carefully preached in their proper connexions with each other; and that, though the beginning of our &s;piritual life is produced by the go&s;pel <HI>&s;trictly taken,</HI> conveying God's grace into our heart, the progre&s;s and increa&s;e of it, is produced both by the go&s;pel, and by the law as a rule of life.</P>
<P>The&s;e contentions had more abundantly expo&s;ed the di&s;&s;enters concerned to the ridicule of their con|formi&s;t neighbours, had they not been as hotly en|gaged among them&s;elves. Mr. Howe had publi|&s;hed a letter, pleading with both conformi&s;ts and nonconformi&s;ts, that they would think of, and be|have
<PB N="284" REF="286">
Chri&s;tianly and charitably towaad each other, as the points in which they differed were of &s;mall im|portance, in re&s;pect of tho&s;e in which they agreed. But whatever good effect this might have upon &s;ome di&s;&s;enters, it had none upon mo&s;t of the conformi&s;ts. Stillingfleet and others exceedingly grudged at the late toleration. To allay their heats, Locke, &s;o well known in the learned world, at different times, pu|bli&s;hed his <HI>Letters on toleration,</HI> in which, amid&s;t not a few loo&s;e hints, he hath exhau&s;ted his &s;ubject, and &s;hewed that force is an improper mean of con|viction; and that men ought not to be compelled by it, into the faith, profe&s;&s;ion, and practice of religion.</P>
<P>After patient waiting for &s;everal years, the &s;ees of the Nonjurant deprived bi&s;hops were filled up in 1691; and the rather, as Turner of Ely had been accu&s;ed of having a hand in a con&s;piracy again&s;t king William. John Tillot&s;on was made archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, Ed. Fowler bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter, Sam. Patrick of Ely, J. More of Norwich, Rich. Kidder of Bath and Wells, Rich. Cumberland of Peterbo|rough, Robert Grove of Chiche&s;ter, and Edward Stillingfleet of Worce&s;ter. Tillot&s;on died about three years after, greatly lamented by all the friends of in|genuity, charity, and moderation, and was &s;ucceed|ed by Tenni&s;on. Many of the inferior clergy refu&s;ed to hold communion with the&s;e new bi&s;hops, but ad|hered to the old, and thus formed a church of Non|jurors. They maintained, That James &s;till continu|ed the only lawful king of Britain; that all &s;uch as acknowledged another, were, by the 2d canon, <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> excommunicated; that the deprivation of bi|&s;hops by civil authority is utterly invalid, and ought not to be regarded; that the authority of the church of England, and con&s;equently the church it&s;elf, re|&s;ides in the Nonjurors and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, who have &s;tedfa&s;tly adhered to her true con&s;titutions; and that all that depart from them, or join the new &s;chi&s;ma|tical bi&s;hops, are &s;chi&s;matics, and all &s;uch clergy as do &s;o, forfeit their office, and cannot di&s;pen&s;e the
<PB N="285" REF="287">
ordinances of God to any edification. Hicks, Ket|tlewell, and Le&s;ly, were principal &s;upporters of this &s;cheme. Hellier and others, but e&s;pecially Hoadly, afterward bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, oppo&s;ed them.</P>
<P>As king William had long re&s;trained the convo|cation from meeting and tran&s;acting bu&s;ine&s;s at the &s;ame time with the parliament, a Remon&s;trance was publi&s;hed in 1697, bearing, That convocations were now as nece&s;&s;ary, as ever they had been in the Chri&s;|tian church; that William had &s;worn to maintain the rights of the Engli&s;h church; that the convo|cation ought to be called whenever the parliament &s;its; that they are a &s;piritual parliament, con&s;i&s;ting of an Upper and Lower Hou&s;e,&mdash;and have power to proceed again&s;t &s;uch as are guilty of here&s;y, &s;chi&s;m, or any other &s;piritual offences, without re&s;triction by any act of parliament; and that their <HI>canons</HI> are binding, if agreeable to common &s;en&s;e, his maje&s;ty's prerogative, and the laws of the land. This kindled a new controver&s;y, which was not &s;oon, if ever ad|ju&s;ted. Dr. Wake, afterward archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury, in &s;everal tracts, laboured to prove the power of Chri&s;tian princes over eccle&s;ia&s;tical Synods, and was an&s;wered by Hill and Atterbury, in his <HI>Rights, powers, and privileges of an Engli&s;h convocation &s;tated and vindicated,</HI> who, in their turn, were an&s;wered by Kennet, Burnet, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The conte&s;ts of the di&s;&s;enters concerning the doc|trines of the go&s;pel, and of the Epi&s;copalians con|cerning church government, were not fini&s;hed, when the convocation &s;at down in A. D. 1700. Bent up|on a&s;&s;erting their own independency of the Upper, the Lower Hou&s;e refu&s;ed to adjourn, when required by the archbi&s;hop. Without any allowance from the king, they collected and read &s;everal books, and marked their errors. Some members complained with great warmth of Burnet's expo&s;ition of the <HI>Thirty-nine articles.</HI> They intended to have &s;trength|ened the church with additional <HI>canons.</HI> But, as his maje&s;ty had given them no licence to proceed to bu|&s;ine&s;s,
<PB N="286" REF="288">
the archbi&s;hop prorogued their meeting till May, after they had &s;itten &s;ome months to no pur|po&s;e. A new conte&s;t en&s;ued, Whether the Lower Hou&s;e of convocation have power to adjourn or con|tinue them&s;elves, as they plea&s;e? Many tracts re|lative to this point were publi&s;hed. The Upper Hou&s;e laboured by all the expedients they could de|vi&s;e, to have peace and harmony with the Lower, till at la&s;t his maje&s;ty's death in March 1702, for a time hu&s;hed their debate.</P>
<P>ANNE had &s;carcely &s;ucceeded him, when the Pre&s;byterian, Independent, and Bapti&s;t di&s;&s;enters pre&s;ented her with a joint addre&s;s. Their conform|ing enemies already hoped to revive their former oppre&s;&s;ion. Before this, Clark&s;on had publi&s;hed his <HI>Account of the primitive bi&s;hops and liturgies,</HI> King his <HI>Con&s;titution of the primitive church,</HI> James Owen his <HI>Plea for the validity of Pre&s;byterian ordination,</HI> and Tong his <HI>Vindication of the di&s;&s;enters,</HI>&mdash;none of which plea&s;ed the Epi&s;copalian bigots. Sir Humphrey Ed|win, a di&s;&s;enting mayor of London, about five years before, had carried the <HI>regalia,</HI> or badges of his of|fice, to the meeting at <HI>Pinner's Hall.</HI> Some tracts had been publi&s;hed for and again&s;t the occa&s;ional conformity of di&s;&s;enters, bearing public office.&mdash; Having got rid of king William, whom they hear|tily hated, and got a queen of their own temper, their enemies re&s;olved to hamper their toleration with additional re&s;trictions and conditions, and to exclude them from all public office, unle&s;s they fully and con&s;tantly conformed to the church.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had the parliament met, than the Com|mons appeared chiefly bent for carrying a Bill for the exclu&s;ion of all occa&s;ional conformi&s;ts from pub|lic offices under the crown, and bearing, That who|&s;oever, after taking of the &s;acramental Te&s;t for offi|ces of tru&s;t or magi&s;tracy in corporations, frequented any meeting of di&s;&s;enters for the public wor&s;hip o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> God, &s;hould pay a fine of 500 pounds &s;terling; and
<PB N="287" REF="289">
five pounds more for every day he retained his office after he had been at any &s;uch meeting. As the Lords would not agree to it, it was dropt. In 1703, the Commons altered their Bill a little, but the Lords again rejected it. In 1704, the Commons brought it in a third time, and many of them attempted to tack it to a money bill, that the one might not be got rejected without the other. But this mi&s;carried, and the Lords refu&s;ed the Bill a &s;econd reading. None oppo&s;ed it more earne&s;tly than bi&s;hop Burnet and his moderate Epi&s;copal brethren.</P>
<P>This Bill occa&s;ioned a prodigious number of pub|lications for and again&s;t occa&s;ional conformity. The enemies of the di&s;&s;enters pled, That, if they could occa&s;ionally conform for the &s;ake of an office, their &s;eparation was not matter of con&s;cience with them, but a real &s;chi&s;m; that if occa&s;ional conformity was lawful, con&s;tant conformity mu&s;t be &s;o likewi&s;e; and that either their occa&s;ional conformity or their &s;tated nonconformity mu&s;t be hypocritical. The di&s;&s;enters and other friends of occa&s;ional conformity pled, That though they thought it duty to maintain &s;tated com|munion with &s;uch as they reckoned wrongfully ex|cluded from the national church,&mdash;as a te&s;timony a|gain&s;t &s;uch per&s;ecution;&mdash;with &s;uch as admini&s;tered Chri&s;t's ordinances with lea&s;t mixture of human in|ventions;&mdash;with &s;uch as a&s;&s;erted the liberty of Chri&s;|tians from human impo&s;itions in the wor&s;hip of God; &mdash;with &s;uch as denied admi&s;&s;ion of per&s;ons ignorant, or &s;candalous, to the &s;eals of his covenant;&mdash;with &s;uch, who&s;e principles mo&s;t admitted of Chri&s;tian charity;&mdash;and in who&s;e admini&s;trations their &s;ouls experienced mo&s;t &s;piritual edification:&mdash;Yet they reckoned occa&s;ional conformity lawful, that therein they might imitate the practice of John Bapti&s;t and of Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles; that they might &s;hew their charity and regard to tho&s;e of different &s;entiments, and their readine&s;s to join the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, if they had but a proper opportunity afford|ed them.

out of breath, an act again&s;t the admi&s;&s;ion of occa|&s;ional conformi&s;ts to any places of power and tru&s;t, pa&s;&s;ed in 1711.</P>
<P>In&s;tigated by bi&s;hop Burnet, Anne, in 1704, re|mitted the arrears of the tithes to the poor clergy, and offered to allot her whole &s;hare of the fir&s;t fruits and tithes for that end. The parliament pa&s;&s;ed an act for alienation of this branch of the revenue for &s;aid end, and for forming a corporation to &s;ee to the application of it accordingly; and they repealed the &s;tatute of <HI>Mortmain,</HI> &s;o far as to allow per&s;ons to di&s;pone what they plea&s;ed for the augmentation of benefices. This kindne&s;s did not reconcile the cler|gy to Burnet, whom they had long &s;o heartily hated. The Lower Hou&s;e of convocation &s;till contended with their &s;uperiors in the Upper. They be&s;ought her maje&s;ty to protect them, and take the point of de|bate between them into her own hand for deci&s;ion. In 1705, the Upper Hou&s;e, having drawn up an addre&s;s of thanks to her for her affectionate care of the church, which the parliament had lately declared to be in no danger, the Lower One, without offer|ing any rea&s;on, refu&s;ed to concur in it, and formed one of their own, in a very different &s;train, which was rejected by the archbi&s;hop. In con&s;equence of this, the addre&s;s was dropt, and all communication between the two hou&s;es &s;hut up. The queen, by a letter, &s;ignified to the archbi&s;hop, That &s;he re&s;olved to maintain her &s;upremacy, and the due &s;ubordina|tion of pre&s;byters to bi&s;hops, and hoped that he and his &s;uffragans would act accordingly,&mdash;in doing which they might expect her protection; and &s;he appointed him to impart this declaration to the bi&s;hops and clergy, and to prorogue the convocation to &s;uch time as &s;hould appear mo&s;t convenient.</P>
<P>In 1707, the parliament readily agreed to make the perpetual &s;ecurity of the church of England a <HI>fundamental article</HI> of the incorporating union with the Scots. But the Lower Hou&s;e of convocation &s;till continued to wrangle with their &s;uperiors.&mdash;
<PB N="289" REF="291">
They re&s;olved to remon&s;trate to the Commons again&s;t the union, as dangerous to their church. Apprized of their intentions, her maje&s;ty required the arch|bi&s;hop to prorogue them for three weeks,&mdash;before the expiration of which, the act for the union had pa&s;&s;ed in parliament. They remon&s;trated to the Upper Hou&s;e again&s;t the prorogation, and pretended, that the convocation had never been prorogued dur|ing the &s;itting of parliament. But from the records it appeared, that on &s;everal occa&s;ions it had been prorogued, while the parliament &s;at, and in &s;ome in&s;tances had &s;at after the parliament had been di&s;|&s;olved. Informed of their behaviour, the queen wrote to the archbi&s;hop, that &s;he looked on them as invading her &s;upremacy; and that if they attempted any &s;uch thing for the future, &s;he would take care to puni&s;h the offenders. About the &s;ame time, the French Prote&s;tants pro&s;ecuted Elias Marion, John Cavalier, and Durand Fage, before Compton bi&s;hop of London. They were declared impo&s;tors. Not|with&s;tanding this &s;entence was confirmed by the bi|&s;hops, the&s;e French prophets, or rather enthu&s;ia&s;ts, held their a&s;&s;emblies in London, under the counte|nance of Sir Richard Bulkley and John Lacy;&mdash;re|viled the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy;&mdash;and denounced the judgments of God again&s;t London and the whole Briti&s;h nation. The French Prote&s;tants therefore again pro&s;ecuted them, and each of them was &s;ined in twenty marks, and condemned to &s;tand twice on a &s;caffold, with papers on their brea&s;t, exhibiting their offence.</P>
<P>For twenty years, multitudes of the Engli&s;h con|formi&s;ts had continued reviling the Revolution. K. William had &s;carcely expired, when his character and conduct were mo&s;t rudely abu&s;ed. So loud were the outcries of the church being in danger, e&s;pecially by tho&s;e that lived more like brutes or devils, than like Chri&s;tians, that the parliament, in 1705, had been obliged to take this matter into con&s;ideration, and had re&s;olved, That the church was in a flouri&s;h|ing
<PB N="290" REF="292">
condition; and that whoever attempted to per|&s;uade people, that &s;he was in danger, &s;hould be held an enemy to the queen, church, and kingdom. Not|with&s;tanding all this, Dr. H. Sacheverel, in 1709, publi&s;hed two &s;ermons, in which he pretended, that the nece&s;&s;ary means of bringing about the Revoluti|on were odious and unju&s;tifiable; that the act tole|rating Prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters was unrea&s;onable and un|warrantable; that the e&s;tabli&s;hed church of England was in great danger under her maje&s;ty's admini&s;tra|tion; that the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration of both church and &s;tate tended to de&s;troy their con&s;titution. The Commons declared his &s;ermons &s;candalous and &s;edi|tious libels; and impeached him&s;elf of high crimes and mi&s;demeanors before the Lords. The Commons too warm pro&s;ecution of him di&s;gu&s;ted many that were of moderate principles. The Tories pretended, that the Whigs had formed a de&s;ign to pull down the church, and by this pro&s;ecution meant to try their &s;trength in the parliament, before they at|tempted their principal object. The&s;e reports were too readily credited and &s;pread by many of the clergy, in order to inflame their people in favour of Sache|verel. During his trial, of three weeks continuance, her maje&s;ty every day attended in the Hou&s;e, though not in her royal appearances, and crowds of people attended him to and from it, and pre&s;&s;ed to ki&s;s his hand, as if he had been &s;ome famous Confe&s;&s;or.&mdash; They be&s;et the queen's chariot, and cried, That they hoped, &s;he was for Dr. Sacheverel. After his coun|cil had fini&s;hed their defence, he, in a &s;peech, &s;o|lemnly ju&s;tified his intentions toward her maje&s;ty and government, re&s;pectfully mentioned the Revolution, and Prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown; but main|tained the doctrine of pa&s;&s;ive obedience to &s;overeigns, as a maxim of the Engli&s;h church. As Anne &s;e|cretly favoured his cau&s;e, her chaplains encouraged and extolled him as the champion of the church.&mdash; After much virulent altercation, he was found guilty, condemned to forbear preaching for three years, and
<PB N="291" REF="293">
his &s;ermons to be publicly burnt by the hangman of London. His friends con&s;idered the lenity of his &s;entence as a proof of their victory over his oppo|nents.&mdash;Being pre&s;ented to a living in North Wales, he went thither with all the pomp and magnificence of a prince, was received by the univer&s;ity of Oxford, and the magi&s;trates of &s;everal towns, in his way, in much the &s;ame manner as if a king, and was often attended by about a thou&s;and hor&s;e, and nothing was heard, but the cry of <HI>The church and Dr. Sacheverel.</HI> No &s;ooner was his &s;entence expired, in 1713, than the new Hou&s;e of Commons called him to preach be|fore them, and the queen pre&s;ented him to the rich benefice of St. Andrews, London.</P>
<P>Q. Anne having turned out all her Whig mini|&s;ters, except the duke of Marlborough, and di&s;&s;olved her Whiggi&s;h parliament, great care was taken to provide members to her ta&s;te for the next. Such was the enthu&s;ia&s;tical zeal for Dr. Sacheverel, that few were returned members, but &s;uch as had di&s;tin|gui&s;hed them&s;elves in oppo&s;ition to the Whig admi|ni&s;tration. Being met in 1711, they appointed fifty new churches to be built in London, and excluded the di&s;&s;enters from all civil offices or places of power and tru&s;t, unle&s;s they became con&s;tant conformi&s;ts. The Lower Hou&s;e of convocation cho&s;e Dr. Atter|bury, a furious Tory, for their prolocutor and direc|tor, while the queen marked her contempt of the bi&s;hops, many of whom were too Whiggi&s;h for her new &s;chemes of introducing a Popi&s;h pretender, and overturning the liberties of both church and &s;tate. She called the two hou&s;es of convocation to repre&s;s the attempts of profane per&s;ons again&s;t religion.&mdash; Atterbury drew up a repre&s;entation of the &s;tate of religion ever &s;ince the Revolution, containing mo&s;t &s;evere &s;trictures upon the admini&s;tration. The bi&s;h|ops drew up one more moderate, and propo&s;ed &s;eve|ral regulations. But the Hou&s;es could agree in almo&s;t nothing, but the cen&s;uring of the Arian tenets vented by Whi&s;ton, profe&s;&s;or of mathematics in the univer|&s;ity
<PB N="292" REF="294">
of Cambridge. But, as they did not cen&s;ure him&s;elf, and the queen did not ratify their cen&s;ure on his doctrine, he continued publicly ju&s;tifying and pleading, that the <HI>apo&s;tolical con&s;titutions</HI> were not only canonical &s;cripture, but in point of authority preferable to our Go&s;pels. To prevent the growth of &s;chi&s;m, the parliament, in 1714, notwith&s;tanding great oppo&s;ition in both hou&s;es, enacted, That no di&s;&s;enters &s;hould be allowed to teach in any &s;chool or academy. But the queen dying on the very day on which the force of this &s;tatute commenced, it became null and void.</P>
<P>WHEN king George I. came to the throne, he marked an evident bias toward the Whigs, who had &s;o earne&s;tly laboured for his advancement. This provoked the Tories, and even the populace again&s;t him. Dangerous tumults were rai&s;ed at Birming|ham, Bri&s;tol, Chippenham, Norwich, Reading, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The cry of the party was, <HI>Down with the Whigs, and up with Sacheverel for ever.</HI> As the di&s;putes relative to the Trinity, which had been carried on about twenty years, &s;till increa&s;ed, his maje&s;ty required the bi&s;hops to &s;ee, that nothing &s;hould be taught on that head, but what is contained in the holy &s;cripture; and that no clergymen &s;hould meddle with the affairs of &s;tate. The parliament, in 1717, repealed the act again&s;t admi&s;&s;ion of occa&s;ional conformi&s;ts into places of power or tru&s;t, and the act prohibiting Prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters to teach in &s;chools and academies. Hoadly, now bi&s;hop of Bangor, di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in plead|ing for the repeal, as he thought that no man ought to be deprived of civil privileges on account of his religious opinions. As he had publi&s;hed a <HI>Pre&s;erva|tive from the principles and practices of the Nonjurors,</HI> and a &s;ermon on the <HI>nature of Chri&s;t's kingdom,</HI> the convocation appointed Drs. Mo&s;s, Sherlock, Friend, Sprat, Canon, and Bi&s;&s;e, to examine them. In their remarks, they repre&s;ented both, as tending to &s;ubvert
<PB N="293" REF="295">
all di&s;cipline and government in the church of Chri&s;t, and to reduce it to anarchy and confu&s;ion, and as im|pugning the royal &s;upremacy in cau&s;es eccle&s;ia&s;tical, and the power of the parliament to enforce obedience in religious matters by civil &s;anctions. To re&s;train their heats, his maje&s;ty appointed the archbi&s;hop to prorogue them. Their publications afterward ex|po&s;ed them to the deri&s;ion of moderate on lookers. Snape and Sherlock were Hoadly's principal antago|ni&s;ts. Never &s;ince, hath the convocation been al|lowed to tran&s;act any bu&s;ine&s;s, be&s;ides complimentary addre&s;&s;es to the king.</P>
<P>The pro&s;ecution of Bi&s;&s;e for maintaining James to be lawful king of Britain, and George an u&s;urper, and that for 30 years pa&s;t, there had been neither king, laws, nor parliament;&mdash;and his condemnation to &s;tand on the pillory at Charing-cro&s;s, and at the Royal Exchange, and to ly four years in pri&s;on, and pay a fine of 600 pounds:&mdash;the parliament's admi&s;&s;i|on of a &s;olemn declaration from the Quakers in&s;tead of an oath; and their condemnation of Atterbury, bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, in 1722, as a traitor, to forfeit all his dignities and benefices, and to bani&s;hment from the kingdom, never to return under pain of death:&mdash;the attempt of the Quakers to get them|&s;elves freed from payment of eccle&s;ia&s;tical dues:&mdash; the intended naturalization of foreign Prote&s;tants and Jews:&mdash;the propo&s;al of correcting the Book of com|mon prayer: the act for the public &s;olemnization of marriage: and the late attempt of Arians, Socinians, and others, to have the &s;ub&s;cription of the <HI>Thirty-nine articles</HI> laid a&s;ide: and the act for toleration of Papi&s;ts, are perhaps too late, or too unimportant for a place in this abridgment. It is more plea&s;ant to ob&s;erve, that within the&s;e fifty years pa&s;t, the doctrines of the free grace of God reigning thro' the imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, have, by Hervey and o|thers in the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, as well as by di&s;&s;en|ters of different denominations, been not a little re|vived,

and &s;ucce&s;sfully &s;pread, and are at pre&s;ent preached by hundreds, though too often with a re|&s;triction of the go&s;pel offer to <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> &s;inners.</P>

<HEAD>BRIEF SKETCH of the HISTORY of the CHURCH of IRELAND.</HEAD>
<P>PERHAPS, by means of the Diocletian per|&s;ecution in England and France, the go&s;pel had been introduced into Ireland in the 4th century. About A. D. 428, Palladius, the deacon, with twelve a&s;&s;i&s;tants, being &s;ent to form the believers there into an Epi&s;copal church, landed in Lein&s;ter, and gained &s;ome pro&s;elytes, and founded three churches. But being rudely treated by the heathen inhabitants, he retired to North Britain, and ended his labours a|mong the Picts. Patrick, a native of Bretagne in France, or rather of Scotland near Gla&s;gow, was fired with zeal for the conver&s;ion of the &s;avage Iri&s;h. Being driven from Lein&s;ter, after he had converted Cormac a prince, and &s;ome others, he fled to Ul&s;ter, where Dichu a prince, and the whole court of Tarah were converted to Chri&s;t. It is &s;aid, that he e&s;ta|bli&s;hed a bi&s;hoprick at Clogher, and an archbi&s;ho|prick at Ardmach, committing the fir&s;t to M'Cur|tin, and the la&s;t to the pious Binen; and that, &s;oon afterwards, he carried thirty holy men from Britain to Ireland, and made them all bi&s;hops; and that, by his ince&s;&s;ant labours, of about &s;ixty years continu|ance, he &s;pread the Chri&s;tian religion through Lein|&s;ter, Ul&s;ter, and Mun&s;ter, baptized twelve thou&s;and converts, and erected 365 bi&s;hopricks, to be &s;ure not dioce&s;an ones, and died in A. D. 491. About
<PB N="295" REF="297">
&s;eventy years after, one Columb is repre&s;ented as coming from the we&s;t of Scotland, with no le&s;s than twenty bi&s;hops, forty prie&s;ts, fifty devoted monks, and thirty &s;tudents in his train, and pu&s;h|ing his way into the Convention of E&s;tates, which was &s;itting at Dromoeat. Some writers repre&s;ent Ireland in the&s;e times as famous for learning and piety; but I could never find any proper evidence of it, be&s;ide monki&s;h devotions. Congall, Columba, Aidan, Finan, Fur&s;ey, Cuthbert, Colman, Clement, Albin, Claude, John Erigena, and the famous Cor|mac, archbi&s;hop of Ca&s;hell and king of Mun&s;ter, who &s;ettled the p&s;alter of Ca&s;hell, are marked as their principal men of learning. But, I &s;u&s;pect, the mo&s;t of the&s;e were rather natives of Scotland.</P>
<P>The almo&s;t perpetual wars of the many Iri&s;h kings, one with another,&mdash;the inva&s;ions of the country by the Picts and by the Wel&s;h, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the 8th centu|ry, rendered the nation mi&s;erable enough. But the depredations and conque&s;ts of the Danes and Nor|wegians, in the <HI>ninth</HI> and <HI>tenth</HI> centuries, rendered their condition ab&s;olutely wretched. The&s;e northern &s;avages, not only almo&s;t extirpated all appearances of Chri&s;tianity, but, by fire and &s;word, barbarou&s;ly wa&s;ted and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the be&s;t of the country. &mdash;Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e heathens were at la&s;t driven out, about A. D. 1050, there was but little regard paid to true Chri&s;tianity, when the Engli&s;h, in con|&s;equence of a grant of the country by the Pope to king Henry II. and an invitation by one of the &s;even kings, a vile adulterer, for his own protection, con|quered at lea&s;t part of it, and introduced their laws into it, about A. D. 1170. During the&s;e two cen|turies, Marian Scot, Tigernach, Meli&s;a of Mun&s;ter, Gilbert of Limerick, and Malachy, the famed arch|bi&s;hop of Ardmach, who is &s;aid to have emitted the <HI>Prophecy of the Popes,</HI> were their principal learned men. In order to render the Iri&s;h church liker to the Engli&s;h, Henry, after &s;plendidly fea&s;ting the princes and other chiefs, conveened a national Synod
<PB N="296" REF="298">
at Ca&s;hell, which enacted, That none &s;hould marry their cou&s;ins or any other of their near kinsfolk; that children &s;hould be catechized without the church door, and be baptized in the fonts appointed for that end in the churches; that the tithes of corn, cattle, and other increa&s;e and profits, &s;hould be faithfully paid to the church; that all church land and pro|perty &s;hould be free from all &s;ecular exactions and impo&s;itions; that no clergyman, however near of kin, &s;hould pay any part of ERIC, or compo&s;ition for murder; that Chri&s;tians, being &s;ick, &s;hall make their te&s;tament before the prie&s;t and their neighbours, dividing their moveables, which remain after pay|ment of all debts, into three parts, one for the wi|dow, another for the children, and a third for the performance of the Will; and, if he have no chil|dren, one half for the widow, and the other for the performance of his te&s;tament; that all that die in the catholic faith be brought to church and regularly bu|ried; and that all the parts of divine &s;ervice be per|formed in the churches of Ireland, in the &s;ame order and manner, as in the church of England.</P>
<P>Either at the college of Oxford, or by means of &s;ome Walden&s;es that had fled into Ireland, Richard, archbi&s;hop of Ardmach, appears to have obtained &s;ome di&s;cernment of the Popi&s;h abominations, which occa&s;ioned to him not a little trouble from the Pope and his monks. King Henry VIII. having broken off from the Pope, becau&s;e he refu&s;ed to di&s;&s;olve his marriage with Catherine of Arragon, introduced his Engli&s;h reformation into Ireland, and required the clergy to abjure his Holine&s;s' authority, and acknow|ledge him&s;elf head of their church in his &s;tead. But, except Brown, archbi&s;hop of Dublin, few of the dig|nified clergy heartily complied. The primate of Ardmach not only hindered mo&s;t of his &s;uffragans and inferior clergy from &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, but laid a cur&s;e on all the people that &s;hould own Henry's <HI>&s;upremacy;</HI> pretending that, as the country had been characte|rized the <HI>The holy I&s;land,</HI> it belonged to none but
<PB N="297" REF="299">
the bi&s;hop of Rome. And, indeed, &s;uch was the bruti&s;h ignorance of both clergy and laity, and their zealous attachment to the idolatries and &s;uper&s;titions of Rome, that they needed no in&s;tigation. The parliament meeting in A. D. 1535, confirmed his maje&s;ty's eccle&s;ia&s;tical as well as civil &s;upremacy, and a&s;&s;erted his power to reform here&s;ies, errors, and o|ther eccle&s;ia&s;tical corruptions; and enacted, That none &s;hould appeal to Rome under pain of <HI>Premu|nire;</HI> that the Pope had no authority in Ireland; that whoever dared to a&s;&s;ert or defend his u&s;urped ju|ri&s;diction, &s;hould incur a <HI>Premunire;</HI> that all per|&s;ons in civil or eccle&s;ia&s;tical offices, &s;hould &s;wear the <HI>oath of &s;upremacy</HI> appointed, or be liable to the pains of trea&s;on; that none &s;hould &s;lander his maje&s;ty or queen, or their title, under pain of trea&s;on; that the mona&s;teries be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; that clergymen pay their annats, or revenues of the fir&s;t year to the king; that the twentieth part of the annual profits, belonging to any archbi&s;hoprick, or any other &s;piri|tual promotion, be yearly paid to him and his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors; that no benefices be given to any that can|not &s;peak <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> unle&s;s where &s;uch as &s;peak it, can|not be got; and that, if nece&s;&s;ity require the ad|mi&s;&s;ion of one that has only the Iri&s;h language, he &s;hall give his oath, that he will do his utmo&s;t to learn the Engli&s;h language, and ob&s;erve the Engli&s;h order, and teach the&s;e under him to do the like, and will keep an Engli&s;h &s;chool in the pari&s;h for that purpo&s;e; that no <HI>Peter Pence,</HI> or any other pen&s;ion or portion, be ever hereafter paid to the Pope or his agents.&mdash; Lord Grey, lieutenant, by king Henry's order, la|boured to force the Iri&s;h to acknowledge the royal &s;upremacy. But, though many of them &s;wore the oath, few of the native Iri&s;h intended any real &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion. The Pope, in&s;tigated by the archbi&s;hop of Ardmach, tran&s;mitted an order, prohibiting both clergy and laity to acknowledge Henry's &s;upremacy, and fixing his dreadful eur&s;e upon all &s;uch as had done it, unle&s;s they penitentially confe&s;&s;ed their fault with|in

forty days;&mdash;and requiring them to &s;wear to main|tain and defend, to the utmo&s;t of their power, the &s;upremacy of the Pope, in all things &s;piritual as well temporal,&mdash;and all the laws, liberties, and privileges of the Roman church again&s;t every oppo&s;er, and not to obey, but oppugn all edicts or commands of he|retics, made in oppo&s;ition to the church of Rome,&mdash; and to hold all &s;uch as &s;hould obey them, however near relations or friends, ACCURSED.</P>
<P>Not long after, K. Edward VI. came to the throne in 1546, he tran&s;mitted orders to Ireland, which a|bout five years before had been declared a <HI>kingdom</HI> in&s;tead of a <HI>lord&s;hip,</HI> That the Liturgy and prayers of the church, as now tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h, &s;hould be u&s;ed by the clergy there. St. Leger, the lieute|nant, called an a&s;&s;embly of the clergy, and repre|&s;ented to them his maje&s;ty's order, and the rea&s;ons of it. Dowdal of Cordmach &s;till oppo&s;ed, and at la&s;t withdrew, with all his &s;uffragan bi&s;hops, except the bi&s;hop of Meath. Brown of Dublin readily complied. Not long after, Edward not only requir|ed his deputy to propagate the wor&s;hip of God in the Engli&s;h language, but al&s;o to get the &s;ervice tran|&s;lated into the Iri&s;h language, where the Engli&s;h was not under&s;tood.&mdash;On Q. Mary's acce&s;&s;ion to the throne in 1553, the Popi&s;h religion was re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hed. The married clergy were turned out, and Lanca&s;ter, bi&s;hop of Kildare, Travers of Leighlin, Bale of O&s;&s;ory, and Ca&s;y of Limerick, being Prote|&s;tants, left the country, and Popi&s;h prelates were in|&s;talled in their room. But the rebellious Iri&s;h &s;carce allowed the governors any opportunity of per&s;ecuting the handful of heretics in that country.</P>
<P>Q. Elizabeth having &s;ucceeded her &s;i&s;ter in 1558, a parliament meeting in the beginning of 1560, re|&s;tored the Prote&s;tant religion to much the &s;ame con|dition it had been in during the reign of Edward VI. aboli&s;hed the Pope's authority, repealed the &s;tatutes of Mary concerning here&s;y, and declared, That no|thing &s;hould be held &s;uch, but what had been de|termined

Another meeting of parliament, &s;ome years afterward, appointed, that as many of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical dignities were enjoyed by the ba&s;tards of the Popi&s;h dignitaries, who could not &s;peak the Engli&s;h language, but had got in by force, &s;imony, or the like, the Lord Lieutenant &s;hould, for ten years, have the &s;ole nomination of the mo&s;t of the inferior clergy in Mun&s;ter and Connaught, that had not charge of &s;ouls, and none &s;hould be pre&s;ent|ed, unle&s;s he were of full age, and in church orders, and could &s;peak Engli&s;h, and would re&s;ide at his charge.

&s;uch as took up arms again&s;t her, and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Spaniards, the Iri&s;h Papi&s;ts, more generally than formerly, brake out into an open rebellion a|gain&s;t her, under the earl of Tyrone and others, which continued about twenty years.</P>
<P>The Spani&s;h univer&s;ity of Valladolid having, it &s;eems, informed the Iri&s;h Papi&s;ts, that they ought not to obey or a&s;&s;i&s;t a Prote&s;tant king, it was not without difficulty, that king James could be got proclaimed in Ireland, and notwith&s;tanding the late &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of Tyrone, the cities of Cork, Waterford, Waxford, and many others, re&s;tored the Popi&s;h religion by force. The Papi&s;ts &s;ent over their commi&s;&s;ioners to complain of the u&s;age they had met with, whom James graciou&s;ly received, and entertained with a long pedantic harangue, which not &s;atisfying them, they appeared as ready to revolt from their benevo|lent friend, as they had from his haughty and ex|communicated predece&s;&s;or. Provoked with their be|haviour, James was obliged to think of &s;ome new method of re&s;training them. Though the Engli&s;h had, for more than four hundred and thirty years, claimed the government of Ireland, no more than a|bout a third or fourth part of it, in the provinces of Lein&s;ter and Mun&s;ter, or counties of Lowth, Meath, Dublin, and Kildare, had really been &s;ubject to them. In the re&s;t of the country, crimes could not be puni|&s;hed, or taxes levied, but by military force. And even within their PALE, the Engli&s;h inhabitants were often terribly harra&s;&s;ed by the Iri&s;h natives, in their neighbourhood. Ul&s;ter, the large&s;t province of Ireland, having been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the mo&s;t rude and ungovernable part of the Iri&s;h, had, by means of Tyrone's ob&s;tinate and repeated rebellions, been rendered an almo&s;t de&s;olate wilderne&s;s. James hav|ing attainted the rebels, &s;eized on their lands, and ordered them to be di&s;tributed to &s;uch Briti&s;h Pro|te&s;tants, as could and would undertake rightly to plant them. The difficulties of planting that coun|try,
<PB N="301" REF="303">
country infe&s;ted by wolves and other wild bea&s;ts, and by &s;till more barbarous Iri&s;h Papi&s;ts, obliged both James and the undertakers, to encourage both Scots and Engli&s;h to go thither. Being per&s;ecuted at home, not a few of the Pre&s;byterians went thither from Scotland, and of the Puritans from England, in or|der to enjoy their liberty of wor&s;hipping God, ac|cording to his own word. To encourage them, James granted full liberty of con&s;cience to them, as well as he did afterward, to the planters of New Eng|land. The chiefs of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church were far more moderate and kind to the Puritans than their court-favoured brethren in Britain. Loftus archbi|&s;hop of Dublin invited over Mr. Travers, who had been per&s;ecuted by Whitgift of Canterbury; and in 1592, made him provo&s;t of the newly erected college of that city. Me&s;&s;rs. Fullerton and Hamilton, two Scotch Pre&s;byterians, the la&s;t of them tutor to the afterward famous bi&s;hop U&s;her, were two of the fir&s;t fellows of that college. The&s;e gave &s;everal of the Iri&s;h doctors and dignitaries a tincture of Purita|ni&s;m. The lord deputy, who had been a pupil of Cartwright at Cambridge, brought over Mr. Hubart, his fellow pupil, and fixed him mini&s;ter at Carrick|fergus. Sir John Clotworthy entertained Me&s;&s;rs. Ridge and Calvert, the fir&s;t of whom was placed at Antrim, and the other at Carrickfergus. From Scotland, Me&s;&s;. Bryce came to Broad i&s;land, Cuning|ham to Holywood, Dunbar to Learn, Wel&s;h to Templepatrick, and afterwards Hamilton to Bally-water, Blair to Bangor, Stewart to Dunagor, and Living&s;ton to Killin&s;hie, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> all of whom, though Pre&s;byterians, enjoyed the e&s;tabli&s;hed chur|ches and tithes. Knox, bi&s;hop of Rapho, and &s;ome others of his brethren, were &s;o conde&s;cending as to require no more in the ordination of Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters, than that them&s;elves &s;hould be pre&s;ent, <HI>as mini&s;ters,</HI> to make the deed legal, along with &s;uch, others as the candidates plea&s;ed; and allowed all the pa&s;&s;ages of the form of ordination, at which the&s;e
<PB N="302" REF="304">
candidates &s;crupled, to be omitted. The bi&s;hops con&s;ulted them about affairs of common concern to the church, and &s;ome of them were members of the convocation in 1634. At the de&s;ire of the bi&s;hop of Down, Mr. Blair preached before the judges of a&s;|&s;ize on the Lord's day, before his curate admini&s;ter|ed the &s;acrament to them. They had no Pre&s;byte|ries for the exerci&s;e of church di&s;cipline; but every mini&s;ter with his &s;e&s;&s;ion exerci&s;ed it in his own con|gregation. Yet they had a monthly meeting at An|trim, in which they u&s;ed to &s;pend two days in pray|ing, preaching, and religious conference, and in de|vi&s;ing proper means for the further &s;pread of the go&s;pel, and extirpation of Popery. By their amaz|ing diligence in praying, preaching, catechizing, vi&s;iting from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, ob&s;ervation of &s;olemn fa&s;ts, and celebration of the Lord's &s;upper, the plan|ters were remarkably reformed. Their communions, which they ob&s;erved in each congregation, at lea&s;t twice a year, were exceedingly crowded, and many thou&s;ands thereat converted to Chri&s;t. It is &s;aid, that about a thou&s;and underwent that ble&s;&s;ed change at one &s;acramental occa&s;ion.&mdash;Their piety, peaceable|ne&s;s, and u&s;efulne&s;s in reforming the people, made archbi&s;hop U&s;her and his moderate brethren, and the civil governors of the country, approve, protect, and encourage them. But no &s;ooner had Laud be|come bi&s;hop of London, and e&s;pecially when ad|vanced to be primate of Canterbury, than he, by &s;tirring up enemies again&s;t them, both in England and Ireland, laboured to ruin them, and &s;o weaken the Prote&s;tant intere&s;t in that kingdom. Me&s;&s;rs. Living&s;ton, Blair, Cunningham, Ridge, Bryce, Ha|milton, and Calvert, were depo&s;ed by the bi&s;hop.&mdash; They, and about 140 others, in the end of 1636, failed about 400 leagues for New England, but by a dreadful &s;torm were driven back to Ireland, from whence &s;everal of them &s;oon after came to Scotland, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the remarkable reformation there, in 1638.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="305">Hitherto the few Iri&s;h Prote&s;tants had contented them&s;elves with a practical regard to the <HI>Thirty-nine articles</HI> of the Engli&s;h church.

U&s;her, then provo&s;t of the college of Dublin, drew it up, in 104 articles, con|cerning the &s;criptures and creeds; God's nature, per|&s;ons, purpo&s;es, and works of creation and provi|dence; man's fall, and natural &s;tate of &s;in and mi|&s;ery; Chri&s;t's per&s;on and mediation; union with him in effectual calling; ju&s;tification and faith;&mdash; &s;anctification and good works; &s;ervice and wor&s;hip of God; power of civil magi&s;trates; duty to neigh|bours; church, and her go&s;pel mini&s;try; church authority, general councils, and bi&s;hops of Rome; &s;tate of the Old and New Te&s;tament; &s;acraments, bapti&s;m and Lord's &s;upper; &s;tate of departed &s;ouls, &mdash;re&s;urrection,&mdash;and la&s;t judgment.

James and his council. They appear to have been contrived to compromi&s;e the differences between the church and the Puritans; and they had that effect, till, by the influence of archbi&s;hop Laud and the earl of Strafford, they were &s;et a&s;ide in 1634, and tho&s;e of the church of England adopted in their room.</P>
<P>King James had not a little indulged the Papi&s;ts. Charles I. had no &s;ooner come to the throne, and married a bigotted Papi&s;t, than they mightily in|crea&s;ed, and became extremely bold and in&s;olent,&mdash; being, as bi&s;hop Bedell informed Laud, about nine parts of ten of the nation, and having prie&s;ts &s;ettled in almo&s;t every pari&s;h, while the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy, not knowing their language, were of little or no u&s;e in a great part of the i&s;land. When lord Falkland the deputy, conveened their chiefs at Dublin in 1626, for contributing towards the defence of their country again&s;t a Spani&s;h inva&s;ion, they roundly told him, that they would contribute nothing, unle&s;s they got an <HI>authoritative toleration,</HI> and liberty to build religious hou&s;es. This awakened the Prote|&s;tant bi&s;hops to meet and form a &s;olemn prote&s;tation, bearing, That, as the religion of Papi&s;ts is &s;uper&s;ti|tious and idolatrous, and their church apo&s;tatical, the granting of them a toleration, would be exceed|ingly &s;inful, as it would involve the granters and ap|provers in an approbation of all the abominations of Popery, and in the perdition of the&s;e &s;ouls that pe|ri&s;h thereby; and that, to grant them it on account of money any way given by them, would be to &s;et religion to &s;ale, and with it the &s;ouls which Chri&s;t had redeemed by his blood. This was &s;igned by archbi&s;hop U&s;her, and eleven of his fellow bi&s;hops, and pre&s;ented to the lord deputy and council. This retarded the&s;r de&s;ired toleration. They neverthele&s;s became more and more in&s;olent, and erected public oratories, colleges, ma&s;s hou&s;es, and convents. Their archbi&s;hops and other rulers, exerci&s;ed their autho|rity derived from Rome, and excommunicated &s;uch
<PB N="305" REF="307">
as appeared at the courts of the Prote&s;tant bi&s;hops, and even openly &s;aid ma&s;s in the e&s;tabli&s;hed churches. Lord Falkland publi&s;hed a proclamation again&s;t their conduct, but without effect. In 1628, they obtained a toleration, in con&s;ideration of one hundred and twenty thou&s;and pounds, to be paid to government within three years.</P>
<P>Archbi&s;hop Laud, being now chancellor of the univer&s;ity of Dublin, and having Strafford, the de|puty, ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, in&s;i&s;ted in the convocation 1634, that, for &s;ilencing the Papi&s;ts objection of the Prote&s;tants diver&s;ity of principles, the <HI>Thirty-nine articles</HI> of the Engli&s;h church, &s;hould be adopted, as their eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tandard. The convocation in|advertently complied, and even made a canon, ap|pointing, That who&s;oever &s;hould maintain that any of the&s;e articles might not be &s;ub&s;cribed by him with a good con&s;cience, &s;hould be excommunicated.&mdash; Thus they denounced a &s;entence of excommunication again&s;t all the Puritans. They excluded their own articles, which &s;o plainly condemned Arminiani&s;m, and maintained the Pope's &s;anctification of the Chri&s;|tian Sabbath. This, together with the pro&s;ecution of the Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters above mentioned, by bi&s;hop Bramhall and others, divided, weakened, and di&s;pirited the Prote&s;tants, while it encouraged the Papi&s;ts, in their hopes of &s;peedily carrying all before them. No &s;ooner had Strafford heard of the Scots reformation, and their entering into covenant with God, in 1638, than he impo&s;ed an oath on all Scotch men and Scotch women, promi&s;ing an unlimited o|bedience to all his maje&s;ty's commands, and to enter into no oath or covenant without his authority, and to renounce all covenants contrary to this oath. The di&s;&s;enters generally refu&s;ed this oath, becau&s;e it was not impo&s;ed by the parliament;&mdash;they knew that his maje&s;ty was bound, by his coronation oath, to rule his &s;ubjects according to the word of God and laws of the land. The allegiance, promi&s;ed in it, was explained to them, as including an ob&s;ervation of
<PB N="306" REF="308">
all the ceremonies and government of the church e|&s;tabli&s;hed, or to be e&s;tabli&s;hed by his maje&s;ty; they thought it ab&s;urd to &s;wear, that they would not en|ter into a bond of mutual &s;elf defence again&s;t the Pa|pi&s;ts, without his maje&s;ty's command; they &s;aw that it was intended to di&s;grace or root the Scots out of Ireland, and bound the &s;wearers to renounce and condemn the Scotch covenanters prote&s;tations and covenants; they grudged, that it bound them never to re&s;i&s;t the king or any commi&s;&s;ioned by him; they liked it the wor&s;e, that an army of <HI>eight thou&s;and Iri&s;h Papi&s;ts</HI> were &s;ent to force this oath upon them in Ul&s;ter, which obliged the refu&s;ers of it to flee into Scotland. This forced flight was made the mean of their pre&s;ervation from the &s;ub&s;equent ma&s;&s;acre, in which mo&s;t of the compliers, not only lo&s;t their worldly &s;ub&s;tance, for the &s;ake of which they had defiled their con&s;cience, but their lives and the lives of their families.</P>
<P>Encouraged by Laud and Strafford, Bramhall and other high-flying bi&s;hops and clergymen, all along from 1634 to 1640, exceedingly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the Scotch, of whom there were then about an hundred thou|&s;and, and the Engli&s;h Puritans, in Ul&s;ter. In their petition for redre&s;s of grievances, pre&s;ented to the Engli&s;h parliament in 1640, they complain, That even before they had &s;o much as a pretended <HI>canon</HI> for their warrant, &s;ome of the bi&s;hops had violently urged the ob&s;ervation of their ceremonies,&mdash;had &s;i|lenced &s;everal of their mo&s;t learned and faithful mi|ni&s;ters, and oppre&s;&s;ed others in their courts for non-compliance; that, in 1634, the convocation had made &s;uch canons, as enjoined many corruptions in the wor&s;hip of God and government of his church, and which exceedingly retarded the work of refor|mation, encouraged Papi&s;ts, and made way for many Popi&s;h &s;uper&s;titions; that their mo&s;t painful, pious, and learned mini&s;ters had been &s;ilenced, deprived, nay forced to flee the country, and afterward excom|municated, and &s;ome of them lo&s;t their lives; that

while ignorant, lazy, erroneous, profane, and cruel men had been obtruded on them for mini&s;ters, others, for &s;crupling at the new ceremonies, or even merely for their holy lives, were kept out of office; that while faithful mini&s;ters were hindered from execut|ing their office, or enjoying their benefice, bi&s;hops held many livings <HI>in commendam,</HI> and conferred four, five, or &s;ix livings on their children, or other favou|rites, who were no way capable to take care of &s;ouls, but hired &s;ome pitiful curates, as cheap as they could, while them&s;elves were permitted to re&s;ide where they plea&s;ed; that while the bi&s;hops &s;eldom preached them&s;elves, they earne&s;tly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed after|noon &s;ermons on the Lord's day, and all weekly lec|tures, &s;o that a lecturing mini&s;ter is in more danger before them, than a Popi&s;h prie&s;t or trafficking Je|&s;uit; that, to prevent faithful and pious &s;cruplers at the ceremonies from being u&s;eful in teaching &s;chools, they urged on &s;choolma&s;ters a &s;ub&s;cription beyond their <HI>canons,</HI> and excommunicated &s;uch as refu&s;ed it; that they favoured Popery, permitted Papi&s;ts to keep &s;chools, &s;ome of them &s;o large as to re&s;emble univer|&s;ities, in which, not only languages, but al&s;o liberal &s;ciences, were taught, and permitted multitudes of <HI>ma&s;s prie&s;ts</HI> publicly to celebrate <HI>ma&s;s,</HI> and permitted <HI>friaries</HI> and <HI>nunneries</HI> in their dioce&s;es; that the bi|&s;hops publi&s;hed or encouraged wicked libels, and u&s;ed profane raileries and cur&s;ings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to render the Scots and their late reforming procedure odious; that they practi&s;ed and encouraged the &s;elling of church cen&s;ures and &s;acraments,&mdash;and by the mo&s;t ba&s;e means draw in gain to them&s;elves from old &s;u|per&s;titious cu&s;toms,&mdash;and will not marry the poor, who cannot pay the dues, nor &s;uffer their dead to be decently buried,&mdash;and excommunicated multitudes, for not payment of the mo&s;t unju&s;t or trifling de|mands; that, in their High Commi&s;&s;ion court, they &s;at judges in their own, and all other cau&s;es, and terribly oppre&s;&s;ed men by fines and impri&s;onments, <HI>&amp;c;</HI> that they not only condemned the Scotch co|venant

of 1638, but had concurred with Strafford in impo&s;ing an oath for renouncing it, in con&s;equence of which many thou&s;ands had been hunted out, ap|prehended, fined, or impri&s;oned, and even women, ju&s;t before childbirth, &s;eized, threatened, and terri|fied; that the&s;e bi&s;hops, and their faction, had un|ju&s;tly &s;eized upon the be&s;t lands, bereaving almo&s;t every gentleman of part of his inheritance; that, by their own &s;wearing, cur&s;ing, drunkenne&s;s, and Sabbath-breaking, and by their having the mo&s;t profane &s;ervants in the kingdom, they were a re|proach to the go&s;pel, and a &s;tumbling block to the Papi&s;ts.</P>
<P>In 1641, K. Charles finding him&s;elf obliged to yield to the Scots, and not a little embroiled with his Engli&s;h parliament, by the in&s;tigation of his queen, appears to have encouraged the Papi&s;ts in Ireland to &s;eize the government of that country, and then to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with an army again&s;t the Puritans in England, or Pre&s;byterians in Scotland. Glad of this opportunity, the Papi&s;ts, encouraged by their clergy, re&s;olved on a general ma&s;&s;acre of all the Pro|te&s;tants in the kingdom, without regard to &s;tation, age, &s;ex, or relation. They laid their &s;cheme and kept their &s;ecrets &s;o well, that it was in a great mea|&s;ure out of the Prote&s;tants power, who were but a|bout a &s;ixth part of the nation, if &s;o much, to pre|vent the execution of it. It was di&s;covered by Owen O'Conolly an Iri&s;hman, who, being &s;ervant to Sir John Clotworthy, had become a Pre&s;byterian di&s;&s;en|ter; by means of which the &s;eizure of Dublin was prevented,&mdash;and the Scots in the north of Ireland were impowered to take arms again&s;t the Popi&s;h mur|derers: and the Lords Ju&s;tices tran&s;mitted accounts of their de&s;perate condition, unle&s;s they &s;hould be &s;peedily relieved with men and money, to Charles and his Engli&s;h parliament. Notwith&s;tanding his fair pretences, he, in many things, behaved like one that wi&s;hed the&s;e Prote&s;tants utter de&s;truction, and

the Papi&s;ts &s;ucce&s;s in their work, and that was ex|ceedingly aver&s;e to declare them rebels. Meanwhile, they pu&s;hed on their murdering work, in the end of October 1641, and afterwards. In the province of Ul&s;ter alone, 154,000 are &s;aid to have been de&s;troyed in the cruelle&s;t forms. The day before the ma&s;&s;a|cre began, the prie&s;ts di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the people from ma&s;s with an encouragement to &s;eize on the property of the Prote&s;tants, and to kill them, as a certain pre|&s;ervative again&s;t the pains of purgatory. When it began, the Popi&s;h gentry per&s;uaded many of their Prote&s;tant neighbours to bring them their goods, and they would pre&s;erve them for them, and at lea&s;t &s;e|cure them a &s;afe retreat from the country. Having got their goods, they next &s;tripped many of them, particularly women and children, &s;tark naked, and turned them out to peri&s;h, amid&s;t the fro&s;t and &s;now, by cold and hunger. So many thou&s;ands of them died, that the living being in&s;ufficient to bury them, their carca&s;es were heaped up together in large holes of the earth. Multitudes they &s;portfully drowned, hanged, or &s;tabbed to death, even after they had given them promi&s;es of &s;afe conduct,&mdash;or had cruelly driven them along, pu&s;hing them forward with &s;tabs of their &s;words or bayonets. Sometimes they di&s;|patched them &s;o quickly, by hewing them in pieces, or otherwi&s;e, that they would allow them no time to pray. Sometimes they &s;hut them up in loth&s;ome dungeons, with, or without bolts or fetters on their legs, that they might langui&s;h to death in great mi|&s;ery. Others they buried alive, or hanged up on tenter hooks, or dragged them by ropes through waters, woods, or bogs. Others, particularly&mdash;wo|men or children, had their bellies ript up, and guts taken, or let fall out. The unborn babes that fell from their mother's belly, they trod under foot, gave to their dogs and &s;wine to eat, or ca&s;t into ditches. Other infants they held upon the point of their &s;words, that their &s;prawling might divert them.&mdash; Some they cruelly &s;la&s;hed in their heads, faces,

O|ther, they &s;hut up in hou&s;es, and &s;portfully burnt them in them; or they plucked out their eyes, and cut off their hands, and then turned them out to wander in the fields, till they peri&s;hed. Some they decoyed to murder their own parents, or to profe&s;s them&s;elves Papi&s;ts, and then cut their throats, or drowned them. Others they worried with dogs, or by ripping up their belly, tied one end of their tripes to a tree, and drove them round about it, till all their bowels were gradually pulled out. ln the&s;e, and many &s;imilar forms, the Prote&s;tants were mur|dered. Many of their dead bodies were left unbu|ried, and e&s;pecially the&s;e of women, expo&s;ed and a|bu&s;ed, in the mo&s;t &s;hameful manner, and had can|dles made of their grea&s;e. One Papi&s;t boa&s;ted, That his hands were &s;o wearied with killing Prote&s;tants, that he could not lift them to his head; another, That he had killed &s;ixteen of them in a few hours&punc; others, That they had killed &s;o many, that the grea&s;e which &s;tuck to their &s;words, might make an Iri&s;h candle. Nay, two boys boa&s;ted, That at &s;everal times they had murdered 36 women and children.&mdash; The Popi&s;h women were no le&s;s ready to in&s;truct, excite to, or a&s;&s;i&s;t their hu&s;bands and children in cruelty. Such Bibles as were found, were profanely trodden under foot, or otherwi&s;e de&s;troyed. Such was the piety and humanity of the Papi&s;ts, whom we have lately adopted as our <HI>dear friends and chil|dren.</HI></P>
<P>Though the embroiled &s;tate of affairs in Britain not a little hindered their a&s;&s;i&s;ting of the Iri&s;h Pro|te&s;tants, yet the Scots, who took arms in the North, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;ix thou&s;and brave troops from their mo|ther country, repre&s;&s;ed the Papi&s;ts power in Ul&s;ter, while the Engli&s;h troops, under Coots and Monk, gave them &s;everal rebuffs in Lein&s;ter,&mdash;notwith&s;tan|ding all that Owen Roe, their great general, who had come to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, could do to prevent it.

They, who had a little before, in their convention, laboured in planning a form of government for the kingdom, were, in 1643, di&s;po&s;ed to offer their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Charles. A ce&s;&s;ation of arms was a|greed on, for a year, which neither plea&s;ed the zea|lous Prote&s;tants, nor the bigotted Papi&s;ts, the latter of whom paid little regard to it, but went on with their murdering work. The Popi&s;h chiefs repre&s;en|ted to their Popi&s;h queen, That if they could obtain a peace to their mind, they would a&s;&s;i&s;t Charles with ten thou&s;and troops again&s;t his parliament in England. In con&s;equence hereof, not Ormond, lord lieutenant, who was too zealous for the Prote&s;tant church of England, but the earl of Glamorgan, was, by Char|les, impowered to conclude a &s;ecret treaty of peace with the Iri&s;h Papi&s;ts, while Ormond and they were, for a &s;ham, travelling to e&s;tabli&s;h a public one. By this <HI>private treaty,</HI> the Papi&s;ts had the free exerci&s;e of their religion, and all the churches which they had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ince 1641, &s;ecured to them, and were fully freed from all the authority of the Epi&s;copal church.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e favours, the Iri&s;h were not &s;o ready, as Charles expected, to &s;end over their <HI>ten thou&s;and</HI> troops to England, pretending, That they had only bound them&s;elves to a&s;&s;i&s;t in tran&s;porting them over by &s;ea. Meanwhile, this &s;ecret treaty was di&s;covered. Finding that both Engli&s;h and Scots were highly di&s;plea&s;ed with it, Charles, in his de|ceitful manner, di&s;avowed the &s;olemn commi&s;&s;ion which he had given to Glamorgan, and that noble|man was impri&s;oned by Ormond. The Pre&s;byteri|ans of Ul&s;ter, as well as the whole Prote&s;tants of Mun&s;ter, declared them&s;elves again&s;t this infamous peace. Nor did the Iri&s;h Papi&s;ts take care to fulfil the conditions of it. While duke Hamilton, and his party in Scotland, projected their relieving of king Charles in 1648, without any limitations of his power, Ormond, by the in&s;tigation of the queen and prince of Wales, now in France, concluded a peace
<PB N="312" REF="314">
with the Papi&s;ts, bearing, That they &s;hould enjoy the free exerci&s;e of their religion, and enjoy all chur|ches and livings which they now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and all juri&s;diction re&s;pecting them, without being required to &s;wear the <HI>oath of &s;upremacy</HI> to the king; that a parliament be held within &s;ix months, or whenever after the Papi&s;ts de&s;ire; that all laws and indictments of Papi&s;ts &s;hall be vacated; that Papi&s;ts &s;hall be ad|mitted members of parliament, and enjoy all honours, tru&s;ts, and employments equally as Prote&s;tants; that not only &s;hall every thing done by Papi&s;ts in the time by pa&s;t, be pa&s;&s;ed in oblivion, but &s;uch of them as have had their e&s;tates taken from them, or wrong|ed by grants, &s;ince king James came to the throne, &s;hall have their grievances redre&s;&s;ed, and lo&s;&s;es re|funded; that his maje&s;ty &s;hall grant whatever is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to Papi&s;ts. Charles him&s;elf, in a letter to Ormond, but which came not to his hand, till after the treaty was fini&s;hed, di&s;avowed it. Ormond how|ever, probably by private directions from the king or queen, made twelve Papi&s;ts &s;harers with him in his authority, that he could neither levy &s;oldiers, nor rai&s;e money, nor erect garri&s;ons, without the con&s;ent of a majority of them.</P>
<P>No wonder, that the true Prote&s;tants in Britain and Ireland, were highly di&s;&s;atisfied with this treaty, &s;ince by it, the&s;e bloody murderers, who had filled their &s;kirts with the innocent blood of about two hundred thou&s;and Prote&s;tants, and by rapine, trea|chery, and cruelty, had laid wa&s;te a flouri&s;hing king|dom, during the la&s;t &s;even years, were not only pardoned, but well rewarded for their work; and their idolatrous and wicked religion had &s;uch &s;ecuri|ty given it, as it had never before received in Ireland. The number of the&s;e malecontents in Ireland was greater than could have been well expected. In 1641, the mo&s;t of the Epi&s;copalian clergy were either murdered, or had fled into England, the Scots not only &s;ent over mini&s;ters with their troops in 1642, but afterwards, on applications from Ireland, &s;ent
<PB N="313" REF="315">
over in different years, a con&s;iderable number of Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters, who laboured with remark|able &s;ucc&s;s in the work of the Lord. Not a few, who had fled from Strafford's per&s;ecution, returned to Ireland, as &s;oon as the Scotch inhabitants and troops had almo&s;t cleared Ul&s;ter of the Popi&s;h ma&s;&s;acrers. The&s;e all, with great zeal, avowed their adherence to the doctrine, wor&s;hip, di&s;cipline, and government repre&s;ented by the A&s;&s;embly of We&s;tmin&s;ter in the &s;tandards which they compiled, and entered into the <HI>&s;olemn league and covenant,</HI> for the perpetual main|tenance thereof. The Engli&s;h parliament required the re&s;t of the Prote&s;tants in Ireland to do the &s;ame, according to their ordinance for that effect, in the kingdom of England; in obedience to which not a few took it. Few of the&s;e covenanters, perhaps a|bove an hundred thou&s;and in all, but were highly di&s;&s;atisfied with the late <HI>treaty of peace.</HI></P>
<P>During the preceding years, Ormond had labour|ed to gain over the parliament's party in Ireland, particularly their military commanders Jones, Coots, Monk, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but without &s;ucce&s;s. He now laboured to unite the &s;everal parties in the kingdom for Char|les II. who, from the Hague, had written him a letter confirming the late peace, and continuing him lord lieutenant of Ireland. He had no &s;ucce&s;s with Jones, Coots, and other parliamentarians. But he had more &s;ucce&s;s with the Scots of Ul&s;ter, who, like their fellow Pre&s;byterians in Britain, were many of them infatuated in favour of their royal family, and ea&s;ily impo&s;ed upon by Charles' and his agents fair pretences. Sir John Clotworthy's regiment laid down their arms, rather than enter into an army with malignants and Popi&s;h confederates: but the&s;e under the lord of Ards, as well as tho&s;e commanded by Monro, who had ju&s;t returned from Scotland, whither he had gone to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the Hamiltonian en|gagement,&mdash;joined Ormond, and turned their arms again&s;t their fellow covenanters, and took Belfa&s;t and Carrickfergus. As the Iri&s;h Pre&s;byterians had re|newed
<PB N="314" REF="316">
their covenant with God, about the end of 1648, Me&s;&s;rs. Greig of Carrickfergus, and Cuning|ham of Broad i&s;land, and other mini&s;ters, reflected on tho&s;e that had joined with Ormond and his Popi&s;h confederates,&mdash;they were therefore threatened by both Scotch and Iri&s;h officers, and obliged to flee for their &s;afety. This alarming the people, the Lord of Ards, now vi&s;count and commander of all his maje&s;ty's for|ces in the province of Ul&s;ter, publi&s;hed a <HI>declaration,</HI> repre&s;enting the rea&s;ons of his conduct, and many fair promi&s;es to take care of their religion and liber|ties, to the utmo&s;t of his power, as &s;oon as the par|liament's forces &s;hould be driven out. The pre&s;by|tery of Bangor, in July 1649, publi&s;hed a <HI>counter de|claration,</HI> in which they te&s;tify again&s;t all compliance with the Sectaries on the one hand, or with Ormond and his malignants and Papi&s;ts on the other, but pa|tiently to &s;uffer rather than &s;in,&mdash;and faithfully ex|po&s;e the deceit of Ard's proclamation, and warn all that wi&s;h to be faithful to their covenant with God, to give him and his party no countenance,&mdash;as the righteous vengeance of God would quickly overtake them; which indeed it did, within about a month after, by the parliament's army. Ormond had no &s;ucce&s;s with the bigotted Papi&s;ts, who were headed by the Pope's nuncio, and who &s;ometimes a&s;&s;i&s;ted the parliamentarians again&s;t him: but they at la&s;t obliged him to retire to France, and leave the earl of Clanrickard general of his maje&s;ty's army and lieute|nant of Ireland in his room. Charles' renunciation of his confirmation of the peace, and his approbation of the Scotch covenant, and profe&s;&s;ed re&s;olution to hold the friends or enemies of it, for his friends or enemies, made the Iri&s;h Papi&s;ts lay a&s;ide their intentions to pu&s;h him into his throne. They then entered into an agreement with Charles IV. duke of Lorrain, to accept of him as their &s;overeign: but their di&s;&s;atisfaction with Clanrickard, and the par|liament's forces taking their towns one after another, put a &s;top to it. Their conque&s;t of the country being
<PB N="315" REF="317">
fini&s;hed in May 1652, Fleetwood, Ludlow, Corbet, Jones, and Weaver, e&s;quires, were appointed by the Engli&s;h parliament, to command the army, and to govern the nation in their name. High courts of ju&s;tice were erected at Dublin, before which Sir Phe|lim O'Neal, the chief manager of the ma&s;&s;acre, and about 150 others of the&s;e murderers, were tried, con|demned, and executed.</P>
<P>During the following eight years, the Popi&s;h inte|re&s;t was lower than ever it had been in Ireland, &s;ince its fir&s;t introduction into it. Multitudes, perhaps above an hundred thou&s;and of them, fled into France and Spain. Such as remained, were generally pent up in Connaught, the we&s;tern province of that i&s;land, while their e&s;tates in other places were parcelled out among the conquering troops, and other adventurers. Their very name was reckoned dete&s;table. Indepen|dents, Anabapti&s;ts, and others from England went thither; and while they laboured in propagating the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, had the peculiar countenance of the government. The zeal of the Pre&s;byterian cler|gy for the royal family expo&s;ed them to manifold hard&s;hips. Immediately after the execution of king Charles I. they publi&s;hed a <HI>declaration</HI> again&s;t the actors of it as <HI>traitors</HI> and <HI>murderers,</HI> from all their pulpits, and warned their people to beware of own|ing their authority. When colonel Venables came to their country, they continued to te&s;tify again&s;t the u&s;urpations of the Sectaries, and to pray publicly for the re&s;toration of Charles II. to his throne.&mdash; Many of them were therefore impri&s;oned, or forced to flee their hou&s;es, and walk di&s;gui&s;ed, and to preach in the fields or hills. As they and their peo|ple, when before the council of war at Carrickfergus, unanimou&s;ly refu&s;ed to take the <HI>Engagement</HI> again&s;t kingly government, an act of bani&s;hment was pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t the mini&s;ters, becau&s;e they kept alive the in|tere&s;t of the king among the people, and reproached tho&s;e in power, as treacherous to his maje&s;ty, and breakers of covenant. No per&s;ua&s;ion could prevail
<PB N="316" REF="318">
with them to pre&s;ent any addre&s;&s;es to Cromwel, when the mo&s;t of the three nations did it. They would never pray for him, nor his underlings, or read the cau&s;es of their fa&s;ts or thank&s;givings, or ob&s;erve their days of humiliation, becau&s;e they could not own them as magi&s;trates. No encouraging offers or af|frighting threatenings of Cromwel or his fellow u|&s;urpers could detach them from their loyalty to the really profligate, but as yet ma&s;ked Charles. Dur|ing their troubles, the&s;e Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters were not a little u&s;eful, in winning many &s;ouls to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner did the motions for Charles' re&s;toration to his throne begin to gain ground, than the Pre&s;by|terian mini&s;ters of Ireland, like their infatuated bre|thren in Britain, pu&s;hed it on with all their might. At fir&s;t, Charles entertained them with fair words, and a promi&s;e of 600 pounds &s;terling to the&s;e mini|&s;ters that &s;urvived, and to their widows who had died before his re&s;toration, as a reward of their attach|ment to him, during the ten preceding years. But he was no &s;ooner fixed on his throne, than he and his agents having re&s;tored Epi&s;copacy, and indulged Popery, expelled them from their churches, and per&s;ecuted them, as well as the Independents and A|nabapti&s;ts, to their utmo&s;t, as circum&s;cribed by their indulgence. It is probable, they had been more cruelly handled, had it not been for giving &s;ome co|lour to the court-indulgence practically granted to Papi&s;ts. The&s;e very men who had complied in every thing with Cromwel and his &s;ectaries, now reproach|ed them as di&s;loyal and treacherous. Mo&s;t of the Papi&s;ts that had retired to France or Spain, now re|turned. They and their brethren expected, that, as Charles had been bred up in their religion, and had not long before &s;olemnly profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a member of their church, they would enjoy the favours grant|ed by the treaty of 1648 above mentioned, and every one of them have his lands re&s;tored to him, which had been given to &s;oldiers or undertakers, for the
<PB N="317" REF="319">
expence of the war, by Cromwel's &s;ettlement. The Engli&s;h parliament &s;upported Cromwel's &s;ettlement in this matter, and ordered &s;uch lands only to be re&s;tored to the Papi&s;ts, as had any flaw in the con|veyance. The determination of the&s;e di&s;puted claims occa&s;ioned no &s;mall contention between the Papi&s;ts and Prote&s;tants. In con&s;equence of the Papi&s;ts in&s;o|lence, the Engli&s;h parliament, in 1677, petitioned his maje&s;ty, That he would maintain the <HI>act of &s;et|tlement of property</HI> in Ireland, and recall his Commi&s;|&s;ion of inquiry granted January la&s;t, becau&s;e it in|cludes new powers, tending to invalidate that &s;ettle|ment, and to occa&s;ion many unnece&s;&s;ary law-&s;uits; that he would order that no Papi&s;t be continued, or hereafter admitted to be any kind of judge in that kingdom; that he would command all the Popi&s;h archbi&s;hops, particularly Talbot archbi&s;hop of Du|blin, and other dignitaries, who exerci&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal juri&s;diction by the Pope's authority, to depart out of Ireland, and all other his dominions; and that all convents and other Popi&s;h &s;eminaries of learning &s;hould be di&s;&s;olved; that no Iri&s;h Papi&s;t be allowed to dwell in any part of the kingdom, without &s;pecial licence; and that he would recall his letter of 1672, and the order of council founded thereon, which require, That none pro&s;ecute any of the Iri&s;h for any thing committed during the la&s;t rebellion. But, this no way hindered the increa&s;e of Popery. The Popi&s;h plot in England, which happened &s;oon after, occa&s;ioned &s;ome &s;evere orders again&s;t them: but their influence was quickly &s;u&s;pended.</P>
<P>JAMES II. had no &s;ooner a&s;cended the throne in 1685, than his Popi&s;h brethren in Ireland hoped to carry every thing before them, and, in about three or four years, committed more in&s;olencies upon the Engli&s;h, than the&s;e had done upon them in five hun|dred years pa&s;t. They did all they could to inform again&s;t &s;uch Prote&s;tants, as they &s;u&s;pected to be ill affected to James, with re&s;pect to their words, deeds,
<PB N="318" REF="320">
or meetings. The duke of Ormond re&s;igned his &s;word of &s;tate to the archbi&s;hop of Ardmach and the earl of Granard, though the chief power was really ve&s;ted in the earl of Tyrconnel, who, being lieute|nant of the army, modelled his troops, &s;o as might be&s;t an&s;wer his ma&s;ter's de&s;igns. He was &s;oon after advanced to be lord lieutenant. In that &s;tation, he acted in the mo&s;t arbitrary and de&s;potic manner. He turned the Engli&s;h Prote&s;tants out of the army, in the mo&s;t reproachful and afflicting manner he could. By frequently changing the &s;even or eight thou&s;and &s;tanding troops, he got five times that number taught the u&s;e of their arms. He i&s;&s;ued forth Quo War|ranto's again&s;t all the charters of the nation at once, in order to &s;ubvert the corporations, and &s;ecure a Popi&s;h parliament. Popi&s;h judges were appointed in each court. Papi&s;ts were al&s;o appointed high &s;heriffs, and ju&s;tices of peace, and members of privy council, &s;o that they were able to rule all wherever they came. &mdash;James had not long retired to France, from before his &s;on-in-law, who invaded his kingdom, in order to re&s;cue it from his tyrannical oppre&s;&s;ions, when he landed from thence in Ireland, with about two thou|&s;and &s;taunch Briti&s;h and Iri&s;h Papi&s;ts to &s;upport his intere&s;ts. As king William had greatly overlooked the circum&s;tances of Ireland, and colonel Hamilton had treacherou&s;ly de&s;erted him, and reduced his friends in that country to the very brink of de&s;truc|tion, James had here the mo&s;t promi&s;ing appearan|ces in his favour. All the kingdom, except Ul&s;ter, being in obedience to him. Tyrconnel had ready for him an army of about forty thou&s;and, hor&s;e and foot. Had James taken the advice of Claverhou&s;e and others of his friends, to tran&s;port his powerful army to Britain, he might have &s;hook, if not over|turned the un&s;ettled authority of his &s;on-in-law.&mdash; But he cho&s;e fir&s;t to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of every corner of Ireland. He therefore be&s;ieged the remains of the Prote&s;tant troops in Londonderry. Notwith|&s;tanding the cowardice, or treachery of Lundie their
<PB N="319" REF="321">
commander, and the villany of General Kirk, in not making due ha&s;te to relieve them,&mdash;and notwith&s;tan|ding the dreadful famine they &s;uffered in the &s;iege, they held out again&s;t the enemy. Ro&s;en, a French general under James, provoked by the valour of the be&s;ieged, now reduced to &s;keletons with hunger, cau&s;ed his troops to burn every hou&s;e for ten miles around, and to bring all the inhabitants, men, wo|men, and children to him. The&s;e, to the number of &s;ix or &s;even thou&s;and, he drove with drawn &s;words under the walls of the city, threatening the be&s;ieged&punc; That if they did not &s;urrender the place, within ten days, he would put every one of the&s;e poor people to the &s;word before their eyes. This horrid device &s;hocked the be&s;iegers, and animated the be&s;ieged with a furious valour. After the&s;e poor creatures had continued two days without any food, &s;uch as were able were permitted to go away; but the de&s;truction or plunder of all that had belonged to them, rendered them ab&s;olutely mi&s;erable.&mdash;After that about 7000 of the be&s;ieged had peri&s;hed with hunger and other|wi&s;e, and the&s;e that remained, were &s;unk with fa|tigue, and had no more than provi&s;ion for two days, they offered to capitulate. Hereon, Kirk making a bold attempt to throw in &s;ome provi&s;ions, &s;ent up the river three victualling &s;hips, with a man of war to protect them. By warmly di&s;charging her guns on the batteries, which the enemy had planted on the &s;ides of the river, the war-&s;hip drew their fire on her&s;elf. Meanwhile, the foremo&s;t of the Victuallers having a favourable gale of wind, pu&s;hed forward with &s;uch force, as to break the &s;trong iron boom, which king James had laid acro&s;s the river, but ran her&s;elf a-ground by the violence of the &s;troke, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible grief of the be&s;ieged, and joy of the be&s;ieging beholders. But, in a few minutes, by the rebound of her own di&s;charged guns, &s;he got off, and, along with her two followers, got &s;afe into the harbour. James and his Papi&s;ts rai&s;ed the &s;iege next day, after continuing it about three months and an

half. His army, under Schomberg, being un&s;uc|ce&s;sful, king William came over him&s;elf to command them,&mdash;and by his own victory at the river Boyne, and General Ginkle's at Agrim, and the taking of Limerick, ju&s;t when the French fleet were ready to relieve it, fini&s;hed the war. The Limerickers ob|tained for them&s;elves and their fellow Papi&s;ts very advantageous conditions, that without taking any o|ther but the oath of allegiance, they &s;hould enjoy the &s;ame freedom of exerci&s;ing their religion, and the &s;ame title to their civil property, as under king Charles II. Their repeated in&s;olence, occa&s;ioned by the commi&s;&s;ioners management of the forfeited e&s;tates, prompted the parliament of 1703, to re&s;trict this act, and to appoint, That all the e&s;tates of Pa|pi&s;ts &s;hould be equally divided among their children, unle&s;s that he to whom they were left, took the <HI>&s;a|cramental Te&s;t,</HI> and joined in the <HI>communion of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church.</HI> But this act hath been lately re|pealed.</P>
<P>The Prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters, Pre&s;byterians, Indepen|dents, and others, had an authoritative toleration granted them by king William's fir&s;t parliament.&mdash; Some of the e&s;tabli&s;hed bi&s;hops exceedingly grudged them this liberty, and the rather, that their number was about double to that of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church. Me&s;&s;rs. Boy&s;e and M'Bride, two of the mo&s;t bold and faithful di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ters, had their &s;hare of trouble&s;ome pro&s;ecution, on account of &s;ome free &s;peeches they were &s;aid to have uttered again&s;t Epi&s;|copacy and its &s;uper&s;titious connexions.&mdash;By means of influence from England, queen Anne's fir&s;t parlia|ment impo&s;ed the <HI>&s;acramental te&s;t</HI> on the di&s;&s;enters, as a condition of their admi&s;&s;ion to any &s;hare in the government. What trouble any of them endured for refu&s;ing this, or the <HI>oath of abjuration</HI> impo&s;ed a|bout the &s;ame time, I know not. Meanwhile, Em|lyn, who had learned the Arian tenets in England, came over, and for eleven years was a&s;&s;i&s;tant to Mr. Boy&s;e at Dublin, where he &s;ecretly &s;pread them.&mdash;
<PB N="321" REF="323">
Notwith&s;tanding all his &s;ubtilty, he was at la&s;t de|tected by Mr. Boy&s;e, and obliged to return to Eng|land, where, till about 1737, he a&s;&s;i&s;ted Dr. Clark and Jack&s;on to impugn the true divinity of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in oppo&s;ition to Dr. Waterland and his or|thodox a&s;&s;i&s;tants. But the infection which he had introduced, continued, and even &s;pread among the di&s;&s;enters in Ireland, and occa&s;ioned no &s;mall con|tention. Between 1720 and 1730, the Synod of Ul&s;ter, in &s;even &s;everal meetings, had very warm di&s;putations concerning the propriety of requiring candidates for the mini&s;terial office, to declare their adherence to the We&s;tmin&s;ter or any &s;imilar <HI>Confe&s;&s;i|on of Faith,</HI> by &s;ub&s;cription or otherwi&s;e. Many o|ther di&s;&s;enting clergymen, who dete&s;ted the Arian bla&s;phemies, became tainted with Baxterian and Ar|minian errors, attended with not a little loo&s;ene&s;s of practice. Offended herewith, not a few of their Pre&s;byterian hearers, &s;oon after the <HI>depo&s;ition</HI> of the Seceding mini&s;ters in Scotland by the A&s;&s;embly 1740, applied to them for the &s;upply of evangelical preach|ing and other mini&s;trations; in con&s;equence of which, there are now about fifty or &s;ixty &s;eceding congrega|tions in that kingdom, e&s;pecially in the province of Ul&s;ter. Of about four and twenty hundred thou&s;and inhabitants in Ireland, it is &s;aid, that about two thirds only are now profe&s;&s;ed Papi&s;ts, and the other eight hundred thou&s;and, Prote&s;tants.

<HEAD>BRIEF SKETCH of the Hi&s;tory of the Prote&s;tant Churches in AMERICA.</HEAD>
<P>IT is probable, that America was, for the mo&s;t part, peopled from the ea&s;tern parts of A&s;ia.&mdash; But, when Columbus, in A. D. 1492, fir&s;t di&s;co|vered that country, there did not appear in it the &s;malle&s;t ve&s;tiges of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t; nor did the Spaniards murdering of about fifty millions of the inhabitants, in the lea&s;t in&s;truct them in, or attach them to it. Elizabeth and James' cruel per&s;ecution of the Engli&s;h Puritans obliged part of them to flee to Holland, and afterward to America, where they landed in the country, &s;ince called New England.&mdash; Finding that their Independent congregation was like to dwindle to nothing in Holland, part of Mr. Robin&s;on's people, after a &s;olemn fa&s;t, and much fervent prayer, fir&s;t &s;et &s;ail for America, in two &s;hips, and, after terrible di&s;tre&s;s by the way, occa&s;ioned by the treachery of the &s;hipma&s;ters and the bad weather, they at la&s;t, in Nov. 1620, arrived, to the number of about an hundred, having lo&s;t one of their &s;hips. In the place, to which Pro|vidence directed them, contrary to their own incli|nations, God had prepared room for them, by a plague, which, in the preceding year, had carried off about nine tenths of the inhabitants. But the fa|tigue of their voyage, and the &s;everity of the winter, cut off not a few of them. Some others of them were killed by the &s;avage natives. It was not till mid&s;ummer, that &s;upply came to them from Eng|land.
<PB N="323" REF="325">
The &s;ea&s;on being very untoward, their fir&s;t crop was bad. Contentions, kindled by incendiaries among them&s;elves, added to their mi&s;ery. In ex|pectation of Mr. Robin&s;on and the re&s;t of his congre|gation following them, they had no mini&s;ter among them for eight years: but Mr. Brew&s;ter, who had been ruling elder of their church at Leyden, preach|ed, vi&s;ited and examined them; and, at their week day meetings, &s;ome of the elder brethren prayed and expounded &s;ome portion of &s;cripture to the re&s;t.&mdash; Hearing of Mr. Robin&s;on's death, they, in 1629, cho&s;e and ordained for their pa&s;tor, one Mr. Ralph Smith, by fa&s;ting and laying on of the hands of the elders. Except their placing the &s;upreme govern|ment of the church in the community of the faithful, under Chri&s;t, and holding every particular congre|gation for an entire Chri&s;tian church, independent of their Pre&s;bytery or Synod, their principles were the &s;ame with tho&s;e contained in the <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, Directory for wor&s;hip,</HI> and <HI>Form of church government.</HI> They admitted &s;uch as were communicants in the French, Dutch, and Scotch churches, to communion with them.</P>
<P>In 1625, Mr. Conant and his friends, in&s;tigated by Mr. White of Dorche&s;ter, retired to America, and in 1627 got a royal patent for &s;o much of the country. They, after &s;ome con&s;ultation and &s;olemn covenanting with God and with one another, to avouch the Lord for their God, and to walk &s;oberly, righte|ou&s;ly, and godly before him; and to be obedient to their &s;uperiors in both church and &s;tate; and to train up their children and &s;ervants in the knowledge and fear of the Lord,&mdash;joined together, and cho&s;e Mr. Skelton for their pa&s;tor, Mr. Higgin&s;on for their teacher, and Mr. Houghton for their ruling elder,&mdash; who were ordained to their offices by prayer and lay|ing on of the hands of the&s;e appointed to repre&s;ent the brethren. Meanwhile, &s;ome Prelati&s;ts, and one Chri&s;topher Gardiner, a di&s;gui&s;ed Papi&s;t, gave them &s;ome trouble, and mi&s;repre&s;ented them in England.

Me&s;&s;rs. Wil&s;on, Cotton, Hooker, Stone, Mather, and &s;eventy-two other mini&s;ters, who had fled from the per&s;ecution in England, had all &s;ettlements, and &s;ome of them numerous flocks of the per&s;ecuted peo|ple, who had come along with them, as early as 1641. About twenty others had not got &s;ettlements, or had been turned out for their ill behaviour, or for their Epi&s;copalian and Anabapti&s;t principles. The <HI>Harvard college,</HI> for the education of youth in all the literal arts, was erected at Newtown, or Cambridge, about &s;ix or eight miles from Bo&s;ton, and &s;oon after furni&s;hed with a valuable library. Meanwhile, their &s;tate had no &s;mall trouble with the Indian &s;avages in their neighbourhood, and their church no le&s;s with the Antinomian and Famili&s;tical errors, that &s;prung up among them. The male members of the church at Bo&s;ton u&s;ed to meet once a week to repeat the &s;ermons they heard on the Lord's day, and to debate on their contents. As none of the women were al|lowed to mingle in the&s;e debates, &s;ome of them re|&s;olved on having &s;eparate meetings of their own.&mdash; Mrs. Hutchin&s;on, having &s;et up one at her hou&s;e, had &s;oon <HI>&s;ixty</HI> or <HI>eighty</HI> women at her weekly meet|ing, to hear her pray, and repeat, and explain Mr. Cotton's &s;ermons. Under pretence of exalting the free grace of God, &s;he taught her di&s;ciples, That believers in Chri&s;t are per&s;onally united with the Holy Gho&s;t; that commands to work out our &s;alva|tion with fear and trembling, belong only to unbe|lievers; that &s;anctification is not a &s;ufficient evidence of a gracious &s;tate; that believers have immediate revelations concerning future events, as infallible as the &s;criptures them&s;elves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The women readily embraced the&s;e notions, and in&s;inuated them into their hu&s;bands, as the doctrines of Mr. Cotton. Such as continued otherwi&s;e minded, were reproached as le|gali&s;ts; and the old mini&s;ters were &s;tarved away, and mechanics &s;et up in their room. Violent &s;trug|gles were made to have new fa&s;hioned go&s;pellers for
<PB N="325" REF="327">
the only magi&s;trates, and officers in their armies.&mdash; Mrs. Hutchi&s;on's mode&s;t behaviour before Mr. Cot|ton, and his too charitable opinion of her, rendered him too tardy in oppo&s;ing her &s;eductions. But, both church and &s;tate being like to be thereby ruined, a Synod for con&s;ultation and advice, compo&s;ed of mini&s;ters, and me&s;&s;engers of the churches, and &s;ome magi&s;trates, was held at Newtown, in Augu&s;t 1637. During three weeks, and after hearing all that the Antinomians could &s;ay, about eighty of their opini|ons were unanimou&s;ly condemned; excepting that Mr. Cotton differed, at lea&s;t in words, from his bre|thren, on three or four of them. But Mrs. Hutchi|&s;on and her followers &s;o in&s;olently oppo&s;ed the de|termination of the Synod, that it was found nece&s;&s;ary for both church and &s;tate to exert them&s;elves in re|pre&s;&s;ing them.</P>
<P>The civil war breaking out in England, the Puritans got liberty at home; and the colonies of New England, for twenty years, in&s;tead of receiving new recruits, lo&s;t a number of their gentlemen, together with Me&s;&s;. Samuel Mather, Giles Furmin, Hugh Peters, and nine other mini&s;ters, who returned to England.&mdash; The planters, who had already built fifty towns and villages, and thirty or forty churches, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> re&s;olved to &s;eize on the I&s;lands on the coa&s;t, and propagate the go&s;pel among the natives. They al&s;o granted three of their mini&s;ters to the Virginians. But the governor ordered them to leave the country, unle&s;s they would conform to the Engli&s;h ceremonies. A war with the Indians quickly i&s;&s;ued in a treaty of peace, and in a more clo&s;e confederation of the four colonies of New England. About 1646, Mr. Elliot, in the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett, and Mr. Mayhew in Martha's vineyard, applied them&s;elves to the in&s;truc|tion of the Indians, with an amazing, a&s;&s;iduity and zeal, and were in&s;trumental in converting &s;everal thou&s;ands of them to Chri&s;t. Elliot tran&s;lated the <HI>Bible, Catechi&s;ms,</HI> and &s;ome other practical books in|to the language of his Indians. The Engli&s;h parlia|ment,
<PB N="326" REF="328">
1649, e&s;tabli&s;hed a corporation of &s;ixteen for the propagation of the go&s;pel in New England, and appointed a collection for that purpo&s;e, which ena|bled the &s;ociety to purcha&s;e an e&s;tate of five or &s;ix hundred pounds &s;terling yearly rent. Bedinfield, a Papi&s;t, from whom they bought it, after Charles' re&s;toration, &s;eized upon it; but the &s;ociety, now in|crea&s;ed to the number of 45, with no &s;mall trouble, recovered it,&mdash;with the rent of which, and with the large collections gathered in New England, they have been &s;ometimes able to maintain ten mi&s;&s;ionaries, and to erect &s;chools, and educate Indian children. It is to be lamented, that, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, part of the money is too readily applied for &s;upporting naughty Epi&s;copalian mini&s;ters in that country; and that any American mi&s;&s;ionaries that appear bent on winning &s;ouls to Chri&s;t, are &s;o much oppo&s;ed and di&s;couraged by the Engli&s;h planters and merchants.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Synod of New England met at Cam|bridge in 1648, and approved the <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith.</HI> Their chief work was to frame a <HI>Platform of church di&s;cipline.</HI> In this, they a&s;&s;ert, That all the parts of church government are exactly de&s;cribed in the word of God, and no man may add, dimini&s;h, or alter any thing in it; that, even circum&s;tances of time and place, mu&s;t be regulated by the apo&s;tolical pre&s;cription of <HI>doing all things decently and in order;</HI> that the catholic church comprehends all elected and redeemed men; that though the &s;tate of the vi&s;ible, militant church, under the law, was national, it is now, under the go&s;pel, only congregational; that a congregational church con&s;i&s;ts of a company of &s;aints by calling united into one body by an holy covenant, for the public wor&s;hip of God and mutual edification of one another, in the fellow&s;hip of Chri&s;t; or con|&s;i&s;ts of &s;uch as under&s;tand the principles of religion, profe&s;s their repentance and faith in Chri&s;t, and walk in blamele&s;s obedience to all his commands; that every particular church has a mini&s;try appointed for its particular &s;ervice, and no other, and the members

Some of the&s;e rules have been long di&s;u&s;ed. Mini&s;ters have admini&s;tered the &s;a|craments to vacant churches; only the neighbouring mini&s;ters lay on hands at ordinations. None are re|quired publicly to declare the work of God upon their &s;oul; and ruling elders are generally dropt.&mdash; For &s;upporting religion and virtue of every kind, a &s;ett of the mo&s;t excellent civil laws were gradually e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Some falling into the Anabapti&s;t opinions, about 1650, and &s;etting up a &s;eparate meeting, gave both the churches and magi&s;trates no &s;mall trouble, and loaded them with plenty of contempt. Some of the Quakers arriving from England, in 1656, were &s;till more trouble&s;ome; nor could the cutting off of their ears, or bani&s;hment, re&s;train their &s;editious conduct. Two of them were put to death, on account of their ob&s;tinate refu&s;al to comply with their &s;entence of bani&s;hment. This drew upon the magi&s;trates a tor|rent of obloquy, and obliged them to publi&s;h a vin|dication of them&s;elves, which was not univer&s;ally ap|proved. The magi&s;trates therefore re&s;olved to exe|cute no more of the turbulent Quakers, but to whip them, as vagabonds, out of their juri&s;diction. K. Charles al&s;o tran&s;mitted an order, in 1661, that put an end to the pro&s;ecution of Quakers for their public bla&s;phemies and profanities, &s;uch as women's running naked through the &s;treets, or into a&s;&s;emblies met for wor&s;hip, and abu&s;ing and threatening magi&s;|trates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>As the mini&s;ters baptized none, but the children of their own members, many children, of &s;uch as had not joined them&s;elves to any church, remained unbaptized, there aro&s;e a warm debate, Whether children had a right to bapti&s;m by their grandparents being church members, though their immediate pa|rents
<PB N="330" REF="332">
had never entered into communion? A Synod met, by order of the magi&s;trates, to con&s;ider this que&s;tion. They were mo&s;tly of opinion, That the children of church members are under the care and government of the church, and liable to her cen|&s;ures, though not admittable to the Lord's &s;upper, or to have their children baptized, till they have &s;o|lemnly joined them&s;elves to the church; but if they appeared to have been properly qualified, but were hindered by death, or &s;ome other extraordinary pro|vidence, from publicly joining them&s;elves to a church, their children were to be baptized. This deci&s;ion was not a little oppo&s;ed, e&s;pecially by Davenport, who &s;ucceeded the pious and peaceable Mr. Wil&s;on, at Bo&s;ton. In this &s;ame year, 1662, fourteen mini|&s;ters, who had been driven from their charges in England, came over hither, and laboured in the work of the Lord, in place of tho&s;e that had come over above twenty years before, mo&s;t of whom were now dead.</P>
<P>An uncommon meteor in the form of a &s;pear, and &s;ome other incidents, &s;tirred up the magi&s;trates, in 1668, to i&s;&s;ue an exhortatory letter to the mini&s;ters, begging of them to be more and more diligent in their vi&s;itation of families, and in training up of the youth,&mdash;which, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, proved ef|fectual for the re&s;training of vice and immorality,&mdash; and for keeping alive the dying power of religion a|mong the ri&s;ing generation. The &s;everity of the magi&s;trates again&s;t the Anabapti&s;ts, who had gather|ed one church at Bo&s;ton, and another at Swanzey, drew a remon&s;tratory letter from Drs. Goodwin, Owen, and eleven others of the Independent clergy in England; but it had but little effect. Some few of the Quakers being puni&s;hed for their di&s;orderly practices, their <HI>friends</HI> in England pre&s;ented a Re|mon&s;trance to the king and parliament, in which they, without any regard to truth, exceedingly ag|gravated their &s;ufferings. Eleven of the principal Pre&s;byterian, Independent, and Anabapti&s;t mini&s;ters,
<PB N="331" REF="333">
al&s;o wrote a letter to a mini&s;ter of Bo&s;ton in their favour. After all, the Quakers, then and &s;ince, had no rea&s;on to complain of &s;everities, but what they drew upon them&s;elves, by refu&s;ing to pay the fines impo&s;ed for not attending the military exerci&s;es on four training days a year, with arms and ammu|nition, or not a&s;&s;i&s;ting in the military watches kept in the towns, or not paying the &s;tipends annexed to the e&s;tates which they held. They wanted to enjoy the protection of government, but refu&s;ed to do any thing for the &s;upport of it.</P>
<P>For about forty years, the people of New England had met with little di&s;turbance from their Indian neighbours: but at la&s;t, in 1675, a mo&s;t bloody war with Philip, king of the Wompanoags, commenced, and continued almo&s;t two years, till Philip was be|trayed and killed. In this war, the Chri&s;tianized Indians proved remarkably faithful, in a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Engli&s;h. No &s;ooner was the war ended, than the people gave over their &s;olemnities of fa&s;ting and pray|er, and many began to grow intolerably licentious in their morals.&mdash;Pride, intemperance, &s;wearing, Sab|bath breaking, and covetou&s;ne&s;s came to an uncom|mon height. The general court of the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts called a Synod to meet at Bo&s;ton, for preventing the further growth of this impiety and profanene&s;s. &mdash;They agreed, That mini&s;ters and magi&s;trates, in their different &s;tations, &s;hould labour to their utmo&s;t, in order to reform the country from the&s;e vices; and they recognized and confirmed their fore-mentioned <HI>Platform of church di&s;cipline.</HI></P>
<P>After New-Hamp&s;hire had been &s;eparated from the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, by the influence of one Ma&s;on, who quickly employed, in his new government, per|&s;ons mean, ba&s;e, or of de&s;perate fortunes, who a&s;|&s;i&s;ted him in oppre&s;&s;ing the people, king Charles, in 1683, took their charters from the colonies of Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;ett, Plymouth, and Connecticut, while that of Rhode-I&s;land peaceably &s;ubmitted to his plea&s;ure. Thus the whole country had their antient con&s;tituti|on
<PB N="332" REF="334">
de&s;troyed, and was made ab&s;olutely dependent on the crown of England. This, with another Indian war of ten, or rather fourteen, years continuance, and the cruel oppre&s;&s;ions of Ardro&s;s their governor, brought the country to the brink of ruin. But, king William coming to the Briti&s;h throne, the people took arms again&s;t their oppre&s;&s;ors, and got them|&s;elves re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in their wonted privileges, ex|cepting that the king, in their new charter, re&s;erved for him&s;elf the appointment of their principal gover|nors, and for his governor the whole power of the militia, and of appointing ju&s;tices and &s;heriffs with the con&s;ent of his council, together with a negative upon all laws, elections, and acts of government, of the general a&s;&s;embly and council;&mdash;and all laws made by the general a&s;&s;embly, and approved by the gover|nor, were to be tran&s;mitted to his maje&s;ty for his ap|probation. The colonies were far from being plea&s;|ed with the&s;e encroachments on their liberties, but judged it be&s;t to &s;ubmit. About the &s;ame time, their mini&s;ters of the Independent and Pre&s;byterian per|&s;ua&s;ions, having con&s;idered the <HI>articles of agreement</HI> between their Engli&s;h brethren of the&s;e denomina|tions, in 1690, adopted the &s;ame, and have ever &s;ince lived together in con&s;iderable peace and friend|&s;hip, upon the footing thereof.</P>
<P>Dreadful was the di&s;tre&s;s of New England in 1692, for while the French and Indians were ravaging the frontiers, the inhabitants were hanging one another for &s;u&s;pected witchcrafts and &s;orceries. The daugh|ter and niece of the reverend Mr. Paris of Salem, girls about ten years of age, &s;uddenly began to play unaccountable pranks, and to fall into convul&s;ion fits, and to be &s;truck dumb, and have their mouth and limbs &s;trangely di&s;torted, and to complain of being bitten and pinched by invi&s;ible agents, and particu|larly of being pinched, pricked, and tormented by an Indian woman that lived in the hou&s;e, and two other women in the town. As the phy&s;icians could not account for the di&s;temper, it was &s;oon blazed a|broad,
<PB N="333" REF="335">
that they were bewitched; and Mr. Paris kept &s;everal days of fa&s;ting and prayer on their ac|count. The women accu&s;ed, were called before the magi&s;trate, examined, and impri&s;oned. The Indian, frightened out of her wits, and forcibly in&s;tigated by her ma&s;ter, confe&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to be guilty, and ac|cu&s;ed the other women, as her partners in the witch|craft. The contagion, like a pe&s;tilence, &s;pread thro' &s;everal parts of the province, till the pri&s;ons could &s;carcely contain the number of the <HI>accu&s;ed.</HI> The <HI>afflicted</HI> had their bodies horribly di&s;torted,&mdash;pinched black and blue,&mdash;bli&s;ters rai&s;ed upon them, or pins run into them. They pretended to &s;ee the &s;hapes of the per&s;ons who tormented them, while others around did not. Probably part of the&s;e afflicting ap|pearances were counterfeited; but I cannot po&s;&s;ibly conceive, how they all could be &s;o, or produced by na|tural cau&s;es. The witne&s;&s;es deponed many odd things re&s;pecting the <HI>accu&s;ed.</HI> As they that confe&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves <HI>witches</HI> or <HI>wizards,</HI> and accu&s;ed others, were ordinarily &s;pared, no doubt, &s;everals were hereby, as well as by the confounding tediou&s;ne&s;s of their ex|aminations, and &s;ometimes tortures, led to confe&s;s them&s;elves guilty, when they were not. An a&s;&s;em|bly of mini&s;ters, &s;ummoned by the governor in June, declared them&s;elves of opinion, That, con&s;idering the power and craft of Satan, apparitions of per&s;ons afflicting others, or alterations made on the afflicted by a look or touch of the accu&s;ed, were no proofs of their being witches; and that a good name, obtained by a good life, ought not to be forfeited by mere <HI>&s;pec|tral</HI> accu&s;ations:&mdash;but this declaration was too little regarded. Twenty-eight were condemned to death, and nineteen of them executed, all of whom died prote&s;ting their innocence.</P>
<P>The number of the <HI>confe&s;&s;ing witches,</HI> who accu&s;ed others to &s;ave them&s;elves, now amounting to fifty, and the <HI>afflicted</HI> overdoing their part, people began to fear every one for him&s;elf and his friends. They who had, a little before, been in danger of being
<PB N="334" REF="336">
torn to pieces by the mob, or had been put to death, e&s;pecially &s;uch as had died with remarkable appear|ances of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, were univer&s;ally pitied. Pro|&s;ecutions were &s;topped, and about 150 relieved from their impri&s;onment. One of the judges, and the twelve jurymen, publicly acknowledged their mi&s;|take in the pro&s;ecution. Mr. Paris, who had begun and zealou&s;ly promoted it, acknowledged his &s;in, and begged pardon of God and men; but nothing le&s;s than his removal from them, would &s;atisfy his con|gregation. It was certainly faulty, that the <HI>accu&s;ers</HI> were not &s;trictly tried, and brought to condign pu|ni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Since the beginning of this century, except as to a gradual decay of the power, and even of the ap|pearances of religion, the church in New England has continued on much the &s;ame footing. Indepen|dents, connected with half Pre&s;byterians, compo&s;e their e&s;tabli&s;hed church: but Epi&s;copalians, Ana|bapti&s;ts, and Quakers are freely tolerated. By the mini&s;trations of Me&s;&s;rs. Jonathan Edwards, George Whitefield, Gilbert Tennent, and others, very re|markable impre&s;&s;ions were made on the &s;ouls, and even on the bodies of multitudes, in 1736 and 1740. This many highly extolled, as an extraordinary work of the Spirit of God, while others decried it as a de|lu&s;ion of Satan. It is certain, that the imprudence and error of &s;ome of the mini&s;ters, and e&s;pecially of the illiterate exhorters, who promoted it, and their ra&s;h cen&s;ures of others, and their pretences to vi&s;ions, prophecy, and ab&s;olute perfection in holine&s;s, and other extravagancies,&mdash;and the &s;udden return of multitudes of the &s;ubjects of the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ir wonted, or greater, abominations, tended much to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;&s;en the credit of it. The truly great Mr. Ed|wards, &s;eems to have been at la&s;t convinced, that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re was a &s;ad mixture of delu&s;ion incorporated with, or joined to it. At pre&s;ent, I do not know, that the &s;tate of the church in New England is much preferable to that in Britain. About 1740, the pro|vince
<PB N="335" REF="337">
of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett contained about 100 Engli&s;h congregations and 30 Indian ones,&mdash;of all which, not above three or four followed the forms of the Engli&s;h church.&mdash;Another revival of religion is &s;aid to have taken place in it of late. There are about &s;even or eight hundred churches in New England, of which thirty-&s;ix are Epi&s;copalian, and not a few Pre&s;byterian.</P>
<P>The province of NEW YORK continued in the hands of the Dutch from A. D. 1604 to 1664, when the Engli&s;h took it from them. About 1686, king James gave order for admi&s;&s;ion of the French mi&s;&s;io|naries from Canada into it, in order to convert the inhabitants to Popery. But Dungan, the Popi&s;h governor, perceiving that the&s;e mi&s;&s;ionaries would decoy the people into the French intere&s;t, comman|ded them to leave the country. Since which, tho' that of the church of England hath had a &s;ort of e&s;tabli&s;hment, yet not only the Dutch and Swedes, who continued in the country, but all others, except Papi&s;ts, have been here tolerated in the free exerci&s;e of their religion, whether Lutherans, Calvini&s;ts, Pre&s;byterians, Independents, Bapti&s;ts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>NEW JERSEY was taken from the Dutch, about the &s;ame time with New York. James, duke of York, being con&s;tituted principal proprietor, per|haps for a trial of what might be expected from his like conduct in Britain,&mdash;indulged, if he did not en|courage Papi&s;ts, rigid Epi&s;copalians, Quakers, Pre&s;|byterians, Independents, and Bapti&s;ts, to become proprietors and &s;ettlers in it. Notwith&s;tanding the encouragement given to the Epi&s;copalians from Eng|land, the far greater part continued to profe&s;s them|&s;elves of the other denominations, while the Dutch and Swedes per&s;evered in their own forms.</P>
<P>PENNSYLVANIA, &s;o called from PENN, the fa|mous Quaker, to whom king Charles granted it in 1681, hath all along had Quakeri&s;m for its e&s;tabli|&s;hed religion, as the greate&s;t part of the inhabitants, at lea&s;t of the proprietors, have profe&s;&s;ed their adhe|rence
<PB N="336" REF="338">
to that. But, to invite others to &s;ettle among them, PENN and his council made it the fir&s;t funda|mental article of their con&s;titution, That every man &s;hould have an unlimited freedom to wor&s;hip God in what manner he thought be&s;t, providing that he did not di&s;turb or injure his neighbours in their civil pro|perty. Hence, Lutherans from Sweden and Ger|many, Dutch and Scotch Pre&s;byterians, Indepen|dents, Moravians, Epi&s;copalians,&mdash;and Dunkards, who&s;e men and women live in &s;eparate communities, much like the Popi&s;h monks and nuns, but in a much more decent, laborious, &s;imple, and inoffen|&s;ive manner, have all their full liberty. The Epi&s;|copalians have not many churches here; but it is &s;aid, that &s;ome of their congregations, particularly that in Philadelphia, is exceedingly large. It is &s;aid, that Pre&s;byterians have near 200 congregations in this country. Near to Philadelphia, is the flouri&s;h|ing college of New Jer&s;ey, of which Davis, Dickin|&s;on, Burr, Edwards, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have been the re&s;pectable pre&s;idents.</P>
<P>MARYLAND began to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Lord Balti|more and his Popi&s;h friends from Britain about 1634. Hence, many of the inhabitants continued adhering to the Romi&s;h church. His &s;ucce&s;&s;or, in 1662, got the a&s;&s;embly of the province to enact, That Chri&s;ti|ans of every denomination &s;hould be allowed the free exerci&s;e of their own religion. But, by a divi&s;ion of the province in 1692, into thirty pari&s;hes, &s;ixteen of which were &s;ettled with Epi&s;copalian clergy from England, and by Dr. Bray's tran&s;mitting thither a number of practical Prote&s;tant books, the Prelatica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> party became the mo&s;t powerful, and a kind of e&s;ta|bli&s;hed church.</P>
<P>VIRGINIA had its plantation with Engli&s;h begun by Sir Walter Raleigh, about 1584. It had its name from Queen Elizabeth, but has alway made a poor figure in religion. About forty years ago, it was di|vided into 54 pari&s;hes, of the form of the church of England, and had only two Pre&s;byterian and three Quaker meetings.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="339">CAROLINA, about A. D. 1622, began to be peo|pled with &s;ome, who had fled from the frontiers of Virginia and New England, to avoid being ma&s;&s;acred by the neighbouring &s;avages. The&s;e, it is &s;aid, drew over &s;undry of the natives to embrace the Chri&s;tian religion. In 1663, Lord Clarendon, and &s;ome o|ther Engli&s;hmen of rank, obtained a grant of it from king Charles II. As &s;undry of the&s;e were no friends to the Engli&s;h act of uniformity, they, to encourage people to &s;ettle on their lands, agreed, That di&s;&s;en|ters &s;hould not there be obliged to approve or &s;ub|mit to the government or wor&s;hip of the Engli&s;h church. Locke, who drew up the original con&s;titu|tions for this province, took care, therein to &s;ecure full freedom, not only for all &s;crupulous Prote&s;tants, but even for Jews and heathens; but, meanwhile, to require every one, above &s;eventeen years of age, to join him&s;elf to &s;ome particular wor&s;hipping &s;ociety, under pain of forfeiting all the protection of law.&mdash; About 1703, the governor and his council enacted, That none &s;hould be admitted into office without taking the <HI>&s;acramental te&s;t,</HI> and <HI>conforming to the Engli&s;h church.</HI> But &s;uch loud complaints of this impo&s;ition were tran&s;mitted to Queen Anne and her Lords, that it was dropt, as contrary to the original con&s;titution of the colony. About 1732, a colony of 600 Swi&s;&s;e Prote&s;tants &s;ettled here, as one of Scots had done &s;ometime before, and another of Vaudois did &s;oon after. About the &s;ame time al&s;o, a number of the <HI>twenty thou&s;and</HI> Saltzburgers, who had left their own German dwellings, to enjoy freedom of con&s;cience, &s;ettled here, while others of them fixed their re&s;idence in Georgia. All the&s;e, after &s;ome contention with the Quakers and Epi&s;copalians, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> lived peaceably together.</P>
<P>GEORGIA did not begin to be occupied by the Engli&s;h till A. D. 1732. The fir&s;t &s;ettlers were ge|nerally of the Engli&s;h church. Me&s;&s;rs. J. We&s;ley and G. Whitefield had charges here, which they for&s;ook, and commenced itinerant preachers in Bri|tain and America. Di&s;&s;enters of every denomination
<PB N="338" REF="340">
have had much the &s;ame freedom here as in other colonies.&mdash;It is &s;aid, that archbi&s;hop Secker had for|med a plan to bring all the&s;e colonies under the yoke of the Engli&s;h church; but his death and the late war prevented it. Mr. Whitefield's Orphan Hou&s;e is now a thriving &s;eminary of learning,&mdash;in which, and the Epi&s;copalian colleges of Virginia and New York, not a few are educated in the liberal &s;ciences; but, for ought I know, divinity is much overlooked.</P>
<P>In the&s;e parts, which &s;till pertain to Britain, Po|pery is properly the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion in CANADA. The French inhabitants of NOVA SCOTIA &s;till ad|here to their Popi&s;h idolatries, while the Prote&s;tants are allowed to choo&s;e their mini&s;ters of any denomi|nation they plea&s;e. The ISLANDS, or WEST IN|DIES, are under the in&s;pection of the bi&s;hop of London, as mo&s;t of the Engli&s;h provinces of Ame|rica lately were. But I cannot find, that the bulk of the inhabitants de&s;erve to be ranked in any denomi|nation of Chri&s;tians, any more than tho&s;e pertaining to Britain in the Ea&s;t Indies.&mdash;Nay, their ignorance of, and inattention to, every &s;piritual and eternal concern,&mdash;their athei&s;tical neglect of God's wor&s;hip, and profanation of his name and Sabbath,&mdash;their whoredom, and other uncleanne&s;s,&mdash;their robbery, murder, and cruel en&s;laving, e&s;pecially of the poor heathens,&mdash;render the mo&s;t of them a di&s;grace to human nature.</P>
<P>THE Briti&s;h Parliament had &s;carcely e&s;tabli&s;hed the <HI>Antichri&s;tian</HI> abominations in their lately con|quered province of CANADA, when God began to tear from them THIRTEEN of tho&s;e American pro|vinces, which they had formerly governed, and which contain about <HI>three millions</HI> of inhabitants.&mdash; Having procured their Independence by <HI>Antichri&s;tian</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the&s;e provinces, in their new <HI>Con&s;titutions</HI> of government, have generally placed Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his adver&s;ary the devil on an equal footing, in giving the &s;ame e&s;tabli&s;hment to the delutions, er|rors,

bla&s;phemies, &s;uper&s;titions, and idolatries, in|vented by the one, as to the infinitely precious truths declared, and the true wor&s;hip of God appointed by the other. Only the Con&s;titution of the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts and of the two Carolinas appear to re&s;trict their e&s;tabli&s;hment to &s;uch things as the&s;e, called Prote|&s;tants, have adopted, under the notion or religious &s;entiments or practices, and merely to tolerate Pa|pi&s;ts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>About 1750, both Seceders and Old Di&s;&s;enters, in con&s;equence of repeated applications, began to &s;end their re&s;pective mi&s;&s;ionaries to America, which i&s;&s;ued in the &s;ettlement of a con&s;iderable number of their mini&s;ters there, particularly in the province<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of New York, Jer&s;eys, and Penn&s;ylvania. After the&s;e had long acted in three &s;eparate communions, an&s;werable to the &s;tate of their connexions in Britain, they, having ob&s;erved, that their &s;ubjection to judi|catures in Britain, did rather involve them in dry local controver&s;ies, which were improper to affect the communion of &s;aints in America, if any where, e&s;pecially after its becoming independent on the civil government of Britain, than do them any &s;ervice,&mdash; did, in 1782, agree to unite in one body, under one Synod, on the following terms, <HI>viz.</HI> That they &s;hould cleave to the We&s;tmin&s;ter Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, Lar|ger and Shorter Catechi&s;ms, Directory for wor&s;hip, and Form of church government, as their <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tandards,</HI> except that they left the&s;e articles in the Confe&s;&s;ion, which re&s;pect <HI>magi&s;trates power about re|ligious matters,</HI> to a future candid examination; that they approved the Briti&s;h COVENANTS of their fa|thers with God, and with one another, and all other regular contendings and te&s;timonies to the truths of Chri&s;t, in the pre&s;ent and preceding ages, and re|&s;olve to pro&s;ecute the ends therefore, as far as their circum&s;tances allow; that while they continue to honour their brethren in Britain and Ireland, they re&s;olve to drop all di&s;putes relative to burge&s;s oaths in Scotland, or requi&s;ites to the legal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y of Briti&s;h
