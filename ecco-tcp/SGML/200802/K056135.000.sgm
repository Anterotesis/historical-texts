<HEAD>Of Chri&s;t's De&s;cending into HELL.</HEAD>
<P>SOme of the Learned &s;ay, <HI>Chri&s;t De&s;cended into Hell,</HI> and for Proof alledge, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 16.10. <HI>Acts</HI> 2.27. Dr. <HI>Willet</HI> &s;aith, that tho&s;e Words of Chri&s;t (<HI>De&s;cended into Hell</HI>) is not found in the mo&s;t ancient Creeds; Dr. <HI>William Whitaker</HI> &s;aith, I could produce fifty of the mo&s;t ancient Creeds that have not the&s;e Words (<HI>He De&s;cended into Hell,</HI>) in his An&s;wer to <HI>Campion,</HI> pag. 215. Mr. <HI>William Perkins</HI> on the Creed, &s;aith, It &s;eems likely that the&s;e Words (<HI>He De&s;cended into Hell</HI>) were not placed in the Creed at fir&s;t, and that it crept in by Negligence; for above three&s;core Creeds of the mo&s;t ancient Councils and Fa|thers want this Clau&s;e (<HI>He De&s;cended into Hell,</HI>) among the re&s;t, not found in the <HI>Nicene</HI> Creed, nor found in the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church, nor u&s;ed in the Church of the <HI>Ea&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Al&s;o &s;ome of the Learned &s;ay, Chri&s;t de&s;cended not into Hell, yet it is an Article of their Faith; but if you &s;ay he did not de&s;cend into Hell, they will &s;ay you deny the Faith, and are a Heretick, and a Bla&s;phemer, and you may be glad if ye can e&s;cape &s;o; them&s;elves interpret Hell other|wi&s;e than for a Place of Torments never to end: Mr. <HI>Bucer</HI> &s;aith, Chri&s;t de&s;cending into Hell, is to be under&s;tood of his Burial; Mr. <HI>Calvin</HI> &s;aith, Hell is the Sorrow of Mind Chri&s;t was in before his Death: <HI>Why ha&s;t thou for&s;aken me?</HI> Is God's hiding his Face when he was upon the Cro&s;s? (&s;aith Dr. <HI>Whitaker</HI> again&s;t <HI>Campion,</HI> pag. 221.) for upon the Cro&s;s he &s;aid, <HI>It is fini&s;hed,</HI> John 9.30. therefore his Suffer|ing was at an End.

<P>Doctor <HI>Ames,</HI> in his <HI>Marrow of Divinity,</HI> pag, 65. &s;aith, That of the Place of <HI>Hell,</HI> and manner of Torture there, the Scripture hath not pronounced any thing di&s;tinctly: If &s;o, then the Word of God &s;aith not any thing at all of them; for that which the Scripture &s;peaks, it &s;peaks di&s;tinct|ly, el&s;e it could not have been read di&s;tinctly, <HI>Neh.</HI> 3.8.

cannot be under&s;tood, as appears 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14.2, to 17.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Fulk</HI> &s;aith plainly, That neither in the <HI>Hebrew, Greek,</HI> nor <HI>Latin,</HI> there is no Word proper for <HI>Hell</HI> (as we take <HI>Hell</HI>) for the Place of Puni&s;hment of the Ungodly, <HI>Fulk</HI>'s <HI>Defence Tran&s;lation,</HI> pag. 13, 87, 89. Is not this a full Te&s;ti|mony again&s;t their Opinion of the Torments of <HI>Hell?</HI> For if it be not to be read in the Word of God, what have we to do with it? We are not to believe any thing in Religion, unle&s;s it be written. <HI>How reade&s;t thou?</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t: <HI>Revealed things belong to us,</HI> Deut. 29.29. <HI>As it is written, I believed,</HI> 2 Cor. 4.13. They confe&s;s it is not written; then, &s;ure I am, it is not to be by any affirmed nor believed; meddle not with Things not revealed, they are but groundle&s;s Conceits, Fables, and Traditions of Men.</P>
<P>That the word <HI>Hell</HI> is not in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> Bi|ble; for the word in the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> for which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> word <HI>Hell</HI> is put, is <HI>Sheol</HI>; the proper Signification of <HI>Sheol</HI> is the Grave, as all that be learned in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> do know. <HI>Sheol</HI> hath its &s;ignification of <HI>Shaal,</HI> to crave or require; therefore it is one of the four that is never &s;atisfied, <HI>Prov.</HI> 30.15. We learn the Propriety of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> word from the learned Rabbies, &s;aith Dr. <HI>Fulk, Def. Tran&s;. Bib.</HI> p. 90. The <HI>Hebrew</HI> Doctors and <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Rabbies are, for &s;ignification of Words, faithful Interpreters; they &s;ay, <HI>Sheol</HI> is the Grave; Rabbi <HI>Levi,</HI> according to the Opinion of the Learned, ex|pounds <HI>Sheol</HI> to be the lowe&s;t Region of the World oppo&s;ite to Heaven; <HI>If I de&s;cend into Sheol, thou art pre&s;ent.</HI> So Rabbi <HI>Abraham</HI> on <HI>Jonah</HI> 2. And <HI>David Chimchi</HI> and <HI>R. Solomon</HI>; read <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 19.16,17. <HI>Let the wicked be turned into Sheol</HI>; that is, Death's E&s;tate or deadly Bed: <HI>Jonah</HI> calls the <HI>Belly</HI> of the <HI>Whale Sheol,</HI> Jon. 2.2,3. Rabbi <HI>Solomon Jarchi</HI> on <HI>Gen.</HI> 37.35. &s;aith, That the true and proper Interpretation of <HI>Sheol,</HI> is <HI>Keber,</HI> which is the Grave; the <HI>hoar Head</HI> is &s;aid to <HI>go down Sheol,</HI> Gen. 42.31. In <HI>Numb.</HI> 16. it is &s;aid, <HI>They, their Sub|&s;tance, and Cattle went alive to Shelach</HI>; that is, the Pit or Grave; <HI>Our Bones are &s;cattered at the very brink or mouth of Sheol,</HI> P&s;al. 141.7. <HI>Jacob</HI> &s;aid, <HI>I will go down to my &s;on Jo&s;eph to Sheol,</HI> Gen. 37.35.

Mr. <HI>Beza</HI> &s;aith, That <HI>Sheol</HI> properly &s;ignifies nothing but the Grave or Pit. <HI>Fulk</HI> &s;aith, The be&s;t of the <HI>Hebrews</HI> that either interpreted Scripture, or made Dictionaries, <HI>Jews</HI> or Chri&s;tians, &s;ay <HI>Sheol</HI> properly &s;ignifies the Grave, <HI>pag.</HI> 89. and that Deliverance

<P>The <HI>Chaldee</HI> Paraphra&s;t retaineth the word <HI>Sheol,</HI> and tran&s;lates it the Hou&s;e of the Grave, <HI>pag.</HI> 11.15. they inter|pret <HI>Sheol, Keburata,</HI> the Grave, <HI>Job</HI> 21.5,13,14. be i'th' <HI>Keburata,</HI> the Hou&s;e of the Grave, <HI>p.</HI> 17.12. Rabbi <HI>Abraham Reri&s;t&s;ol</HI> joins <HI>Sheol</HI> and <HI>Keber</HI> together, both &s;ignifying the Grave; and &s;o doth Dr. <HI>Fulk</HI> in his <HI>Defence,</HI> pag. 91. and &s;o Mr. <HI>Cartwright</HI> on <HI>Acts</HI> 2.27. Mr. <HI>Gradock</HI> &s;aith, Hell is not mentioned in the <HI>Old Te&s;tament,</HI> but as it is taken for the Grave, in his <HI>Good News,</HI> pag. 43.</P>
<P><HI>Sheol</HI> enforces not any Place of Puni&s;hment, becau&s;e it &s;ig|nified not any Place of Puni&s;hment; &s;o &s;ays Dr. <HI>Willet Synop&s;.</HI> pag. 1055. al&s;o he &s;aith, the word <HI>Sheol</HI> cannot be tran&s;lated but for the Grave. There are four Words in the <HI>P&s;alms</HI> expre&s;&s;ing the &s;ame thing in effect that <HI>Sheol</HI> doth, yet none of them applicable to &s;ignifie any Place of Tor|ment; the fir&s;t is <HI>Shacath, fovea,</HI> the Pit, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 36.9. the &s;econd is <HI>Bhor,</HI> the Lake; the third is <HI>Cheber,</HI> the Grave; both the&s;e Words u&s;ed for the &s;ame Thing, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 88.3. the word is <HI>Sheol,</HI> v. 45. the other Word u&s;ed as expre&s;&s;ing the former; and all the&s;e three do contain a De&s;cription of Death and the Grave; the fourth is <HI>Tehemoth, Aby&s;&s;us Terrae, Thou wilt take me from the depth of the earth,</HI> P&s;al. 71.20. in all which there is no mention of a Place of Torment, <HI>Willet Synop.</HI> p. 1050.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greek</HI> tran&s;lates <HI>Sheol</HI> into <HI>Haiden</HI> or <HI>Haides</HI> of <HI>Adam,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>Adam</HI> ta&s;ted Death and went to the Grave, <HI>Gen.</HI> 3.19.

<P>The <HI>Septuagint</HI> expre&s;s a Place generally to receive the Dead; the Word u&s;ed in the <HI>Greek</HI> in&s;tead of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> word <HI>Sheol,</HI> &s;ignifies a dark Place, &s;uch as the Grave or Pit in which the Dead are laid. Dr. <HI>Fulk</HI> &s;aith, Some take the <HI>Greek</HI> word for Hell, but it &s;ignifies the Grave; Hell it cannot &s;ignifie in their Speech that believe no Hell; the <HI>Greeks</HI> &s;ay plainly, that their Souls &s;hall vani&s;h like light Smoak or light Air, <HI>Fulk Def.</HI> p. 92. al&s;o he &s;aith, If the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Interpreters had before us tran&s;lated ami&s;s, which gave occa&s;ion to divers Errors, mu&s;t we (knowing the true &s;ignification of the Word) follow them?</P>

<P>It is confe&s;&s;ed by all, that Chri&s;t &s;peaketh and alludeth to the Jewi&s;h Practice in their Judicature; therefore the Places above&s;aid concern them.

<P>Fir&s;t, The Fire of the Valley of <HI>Tophet,</HI> is &s;o called, in that it did burn Night and Day, and went not out.</P>
<P>Secondly, The word (<HI>Ever</HI>) and (<HI>Everla&s;ting</HI>) the <HI>Greeks</HI> under&s;tand it for an Age: <HI>Ever</HI> and <HI>Everla&s;ting,</HI> are of a like Signification, and is u&s;ed for a limited Time, a time during Life, <HI>He &s;hall &s;erve his ma&s;ter for ever, Ex.</HI> 21.6.

<P>Is it not a very &s;trange thing, that them&s;elves &s;hould con|fe&s;s, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> word Hell is in the Hebrew <HI>Sheol,</HI> and in the Greek <HI>Haides</HI> and <HI>Gehennah,</HI> and that they are to be under&s;tood as afore&s;aid, that they &s;hould, for the &s;aid Words, tran&s;late it in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hell, and then expound Hell for a terrible and dreadful Place of Torment never to end!

<P>Mr. <HI>Leigh,</HI> the Heathen, held there was a Hell, a Being and Place for wicked Men after this Life.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Why did ye not &s;ay and prove, that they hold that they &s;hall be in Torment never to an end.</P>
<P>The Heathens do not believe, that there is to be &s;uch a Puni&s;hment after this Life, for they deny the Re&s;urrection of the Body, therefore they burn the Body and &s;ave the A&s;hes in an Urn for a Memorial; they believe as <HI>Pythago|ras</HI> the Philo&s;opher taught, that the Soui goeth from one Body into another Man or Bea&s;t; that &s;ome of the Philo|&s;ohers grew &s;o tender, that they would not kill any Bea&s;t nor Fowl, for they &s;aid, it may be, it is my Brother or my Si&s;ter. The&s;e Heathen Greek Poets were long before the coming of Chri&s;t; in their <HI>treble Divi&s;ion</HI> of the World they fain three Gods. <HI>Jupiter</HI> the God of Heaven, <HI>Nep|tune</HI> the God of the Sea, and <HI>Pluto</HI> the God of the Earth, in which they &s;ay he keeps his Court and Palace, (no word of Torment, that would make it a poor Court and Palace) &s;o <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Noninus,</HI> Greek Poets; <HI>Homer</HI> wrote of the De|&s;truction of <HI>Troy,</HI> which was near a thou&s;and Years before the Birth of Chri&s;t; <HI>Homer</HI> is one of the mo&s;t ancient Re|cords extant; it &s;eems in his time there was no mention of a Hell of Torments never to end, the &s;aid Poets call <HI>Pluto Summanus,</HI> as being Chief of the Maunes or Spirits below: To pacify the&s;e ill Spirits, a fea&s;t was kept in <HI>Febuary</HI> with Wax Candles burning to <HI>Pluto,</HI> called <HI>Candlemas-Day,</HI> &s;o Mr. <HI>Je&s;.</HI> in his Almanack, <HI>The Cretians are always liers, Titus</HI> 1.12. the great&s;t liars in the World that will fancy, fain, and &s;ay any thing; is it a thing po&s;&s;ible that Wax Candles above the Earth &s;hould give Light thou&s;and of Miles into the Earth, to pacifie tho&s;e ill Spirits there? it &s;eems they are not in any great Torment if a little Light

will pacify them. The Poets &s;ay, Hell is twice as deep as Heaven is high; the A&s;tronomers &s;ay, <HI>Jupiter</HI> the &s;e|cond Planet is 72 Millions of Miles above the Earth; if Hell be twice as deep, it is a hundred and fifty four Mil|lions of Miles to Hell, which is <HI>fabulous</HI>; &s;o there <HI>Cerberus</HI> three Heads, and <HI>Charus Boat</HI> to row Men to <HI>Pluto</HI>; &s;o the Fancy of Purgatory did &s;pring fir&s;t from the Heathen Poets, long before the coming of Chri&s;t, as appears by <HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> who have de&s;cribed at large the whole Common-wealth, and all the Orders and Degrees of Pur|gatory: The&s;e with their <HI>Ely&s;ian</HI> Fields, and many other of their Barbari&s;ms by long U&s;e became venerable.</P>
<P>Your Opinion is fitter for Heathens than for Chri&s;tians: If the Heathens do hold as you do, are we to believe in Religion as the Heathen? I pa&s;s not what they nor any el&s;e &s;ay, unle&s;s they can read it me in the Word of God; we cry, <HI>to the Law and to the Te&s;timony; if they &s;peak not according to this Word, it is becau&s;e there is no light in them,</HI> I&s;a. 8.20. Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> &s;aith clear Rea&s;on proves it, God is ju&s;t; many abominable Sinners enjoy more Pro&s;perity in this Life, than tho&s;e that live far more innocently, mu&s;t be puni&s;hed hereafter according to the Multitude and Hai|nou&s;ne&s;s of their Sins, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 73.17.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> I &s;ee you are more bold to affirm, than able to prove; doth Rea&s;on deny the Puni&s;hment to be ju&s;t, ex|cept it never End?

If &s;ome enjoy more Pro&s;perity than others, mu&s;t they therefore &s;uffer a Puni&s;hment never to end? Outward Pro&s;|perity is a great Ble&s;&s;ing, and you make it a great Cur&s;e; if that you &s;ay were true, there is no Cau&s;e <HI>in the Day of Pro&s;perity to rejoyce,</HI> Eccl. 7.24. nor to &s;ay, <HI>O Lord I be|&s;eech thee &s;end me now Pro&s;perity,</HI> P&s;alm 115.25. in &s;aying greater Sinners, you judge according to outward Appearan|ces both for Sin and Puni&s;hment, and may be mi&s;taken in

both what they are in the inner Man; for Sin and Puni&s;h|ment you know not, the Heart of Unbelief and Rebellion of Spirit in others, nor how God puni&s;heth them in their Spirits; Sin is puni&s;hed in this Life.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> &s;aith, 'tis ju&s;t they &s;hould &s;uffer for ever, who if they had lived, would have &s;inned for ever, <HI>Ca&s;t them out of my &s;ight,</HI> Jer. 5.1.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> If it be ju&s;t we &s;hould &s;uffer for ever, it is ju&s;t our Surety &s;hould &s;uffer for ever.</P>
<P>Do you con&s;ider, that <HI>the Creature was made &s;ubject to vanity not willingly, but by rea&s;on of him that hath &s;ubjected the &s;ame in hope,</HI> Rom. 8.20.</P>
<P><HI>Ca&s;t them out of my &s;ight,</HI> is no Proof that they &s;hall &s;uffer for ever, but rather that they &s;hall be utterly de&s;troyed, for if they have any Being, wherever they be they cannot be out of Sight of God.</P>
<P>Your Ju&s;tice is not God's his is a Death; yours is not a Death, but another thing.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Leigh,</HI> &s;aith, God's intentions from everla&s;ting, was to glorify his Ju&s;tice as well as his Mercy, <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.21.23. fitted to De&s;truction.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Know you any of the Intentions of God that is not revealed in his Word, <HI>Deut.</HI> 29.29. or doth the Word &s;ay that God not glorify his Ju&s;tice, unle&s;s he inflict &s;o great a Puni&s;hment without end; you give neither Scripture nor Rea&s;on to prove that you &s;ay is ju&s;t; the Ju&s;tice of God was revealed and made known, in cau&s;ing the Earth to &s;wallow up <HI>Corah and his Company</HI>; they <HI>were Ve&s;&s;els of Wrath prepared, fitted to De&s;truction,</HI> (your Opinion denies the Word of God that &s;aith they are fitted to De&s;truction) you &s;ay they are never to be de&s;troyed, die nor end. Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> &s;aith, the Covenant under which ungenerate Men &s;tand, and by which they are bound over to this Wrath is ever|la&s;ting.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> There is but two Covenants, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.24. <HI>the old and new,</HI> Heb. 8.13. and 12.24. the old is no more ever|la&s;ting than the Prie&s;thood of it: The Breach of the Cove|nant of Works is Death, therefore not eternal Life in Mi|&s;ery. Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> &s;aith, in that Torment they cur&s;e and accu&s;e one another.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> When you write again, I pray tell us how you know that in Hell they do &s;o; for the Word of God &s;aith not &s;o, nor have you been there to hear it, nor they that told you &s;o. To affirm things in Religion, not re|vealed

<P>They are like to concur and agree if they take the Coun&s;el they give, as not to que&s;tion Principles: It &s;eems we mu&s;t take all upon Tru&s;t, and Hear&s;ay, without Tryal, they all &s;ay it, therefore it is true; but the <HI>Bereans</HI> wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ld,

<P>The third Pillar that upholds Hells Torments are fond Expo&s;itors that interpret <HI>Sheol</HI> for Hell Torments, &s;o Dr. <HI>Fulk</HI> calls them in his Defence, page 90. I would know why Interpreters under&s;tand and tran&s;late a Hell of Torments from the <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> as is not in them, as them&s;elves confe&s;s, as hath been &s;hewed: They will take <HI>Sheol</HI> figura|tively, and &s;ay by <HI>Tophet</HI> Hell is figured, which is a Fancy, a Fable and Delu&s;ion that is &s;trong in many that expound Scripture without Sen&s;e or Rea&s;on; it is as improper to interpret <HI>Sheol</HI> for a Place of Torment, as to interpret the Word Hou&s;e to &s;ignify a Hor&s;e. The Scripture is not of private Interpretation; a Sen&s;e ari&s;ing out of the Brain of an Interpreter is a private Interpretation, and as the Scriptures are not of Man but of the holy Spirit; &s;o the In|terpretation of them is not to be of Man but of the holy Spi|rit: Oracles &s;ignify the An&s;wer of God. <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.2. &s;ee <HI>Job</HI> 12. <HI>and how reade&s;t thou,</HI> Luke 10.26. to interpret Words figu|ratively that are to be under&s;tood literally, and Words lite|rally that are to be under&s;tood figuratively, is licencious and de&s;tructive to the Faith of the Go&s;pel; we are not to interpret any Place figuratively, unle&s;s that figurative Sen&s;e be expre&s;&s;ed in a plainer Place of Scripture; if a Man will have an erroneous Per&s;wa&s;ion what&s;oever the Scripture &s;aith to the contrary, he will have it to be a figurative Sen&s;e, they will be left in the Clouds of their own Per&s;wa&s;ion; &s;o in&s;tead of proving their Hell of Torments never to end by the Scriptures, <HI>Ruffinus</HI> and others &s;ay, they that will not believe it &s;hall &s;eal it; which is no Proof, but a meer Shift, as very a lie as Nur&s;es u&s;e to &s;till Children by telling them of a great Bulbegger, and that a Man will come down the

Chimney and carry him away; but not any but Children and Fools will be &s;cared with &s;uch Bulbeggers.</P>
<P>The Fourth Pillar that upholds their Hell Tor|ment, is the Con&s;ent of their Preachers, their learned and godly Men agree herein, but their weak, and various, and uncertain Grounds, declare, that they have not &s;tudied the Point; but when Teachers and Hearers are ignorant, any thing will &s;erve and pa&s;s for Truth; the &s;imple believe every Word; All &s;orts of Prie&s;ts agree and abu&s;e the People; the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Prie&s;ts blow a Powder into their Eyes that comes to &s;ee <HI>Mahomet</HI> hang, that maketh them quite blind, that for ever after they are led, and the Prie&s;ts &s;ay that the Glory of the Sight of <HI>Ma|homet</HI> is &s;o great, that it taketh away their &s;ight for ever after; and about <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> time, for ten Days there is great Joy about a great fire for their Prie&s;t <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and tho&s;e that ca&s;t them&s;elves into the Fire and are burnt to Death are counted Martyrs; and once a Year the Tomb of <HI>Maho|met</HI> is carried a broad upon a cart, and his Prie&s;ts &s;ay, that tho&s;e that put them&s;elves under the Wheel of that Cart and are cru&s;hed to Death, they &s;ay to dye Martyrs, and &s;ome are &s;o Simple to do &s;o, that &s;o they may dye Martyrs, &s;o the Antichri&s;tian-Prie&s;ts and all &s;orts of Prie&s;ts have great|ly deluded and deceived the People, blowing &s;omething into their Ears that for ever after they are not able to here and receive the Truth. But as M. <HI>Beza</HI> did dete&s;t the Papi&s;ts Limbus and Purgatory, &s;o do I their Dreams of Hell, it being a device of Man without Scripture, with all their uncertain Brain &s;ick Fancies, for the Imagi|nations of Men have no end.</P>
<P>The 5th Pillar of Hell is their wre&s;ting the Scripture to uphold their Hell of Torments; this cozeneth and deceives many under Colour of Divine Authority, when it's but Hu|mane, though they are not plea&s;ed publickly to &s;ay &s;o; be|cau&s;e it &s;treams not to their Purpo&s;e, the Scriptures they alledge to prove, is about con&s;idered; if any &s;ay I wre&s;t Scripture, I appeal to the Learned in the Languages, for to them concerneth the Deci&s;ion of the Signification of Words, who (as I have &s;hewed) te&s;tifie with me.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth Pillar of Hell is their Arguments and Rea&s;ons they bring to prove Hell Torments; which have been con|&s;idered.</P>
<P>The &s;eventh Pillar of Hell is a &s;trong Per&s;wa&s;ion that is in Men, that the believing Hell Torments is a great Means
<PB N="28" REF="27">
to leave Sin and to live a holy Life; and the not believing Hell Torments is a Means to commit all Sin with Greedi|ne&s;s, and to live as they li&s;t; for, they &s;ay, Men live as though there were no Hell.</P>
<P>Carnal Hearts of Men taken Offence of every thing, except the Law of Works, doing to be &s;aved, the Doctrine of Election, God's free Grace and Salvation only and alone by Chri&s;t, without Works, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.6. is changed to be one of the greate&s;t Doctrines of Liberty to &s;in that ever was, and is by the Ignorant made a Stumbling-block and Rock of Offence; and a Cau&s;e of Carele&s;ne&s;s in many. <HI>Ludovick</HI> &s;aid, if I be &s;aved, I be &s;aved, If I be damned, I be damned; the Papi&s;ts &s;ay, if good Works &s;ave us not, to what Purpo&s;e &s;hall we do them? Then we may live as we li&s;t, if we be appointed to Life we &s;hall be &s;aved, though we Sin never &s;o much, <HI>if we &s;in we have an Advocate,</HI> 1 Joh. 2.1. <HI>not any thing can &s;eparate us from the love of God,</HI> Rom. 8. If we be not appointed to Life, we cannot be &s;aved, though we &s;hould do never &s;o much good, yea &s;ee how this truth is turned to Wantonne&s;s, the Apo&s;tles exhort not to turn this grace of God into Wantonne&s;s, Rom. 6.1&punc;15. The corrupt Heart of Man is ready to do it; there are many things in <HI>Paul</HI>'s Epi&s;tle, which the Ignorant Unlearned (that know not God in Chri&s;t) wre&s;t to their own De&s;tru|ction; will any therefore &s;ay, that the Doctrine of Ele|ction and Salvation by Chri&s;t alone is not a Doctrine fit to be taught not come abroad? if &s;o, the Scriptutes mu&s;t not come abroad.</P>
<P>Moreover, the Doctrine of the Prote&s;tant Mini&s;ters is charged, not only to be a Doctrine of Liberty to Sin, but a bla&s;phemous Doctrine, to teach that the Fall and Sin of Man was decreed, they &s;ay is to make God the Author of Evil; the Prote&s;tant Writers &s;ay, that the Sin of Man was determined of God; Dr. <HI>Willet, Synop.</HI> pag. 760. He al&s;o &s;aith, the Prote&s;tants hold, that the fall of <HI>Adam</HI> was both fore&s;een of God and decreed to be, not permitted only, they alledge, <HI>Gen.</HI> 45.5.8.2. <HI>Sam.</HI> 24.1. <HI>Acts</HI> 2. and <HI>Acts</HI> 4.22.28. <HI>&s;hould ungodly lu&s;ts, Judg.</HI> 18. for the Creature was made &s;ubject to Vanity, not willingly, but by Rea&s;on of him that had &s;ubjected the &s;ame in Hope, <HI>Rom</HI> 8.20.

If you hold that any thing is done again&s;t
<PB N="29" REF="28">
God's Will, what Providence or Omnipotency do you leave him? For he that permitteth that to be done which he would by no Means have to be done, it is certain, that he is not endued with &s;o great Power, as that he can forbid that which he would not have done, wherefore you mu&s;t needs confe&s;s, that all Things that are done are done by the Will of God; and Pag. 196. all confe&s;s, God could have hindered Sin to be if he had &s;o plea&s;ed, but he would not hinder it, therefore it was his will it &s;hould be, the Will of God, and not Sin, is the Cau&s;e of God's Decree, and the being of all things; the Will and Plea|&s;ure of God is the Womb from whence &s;pringeth every Work of the Creature, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.11.

God willed and decreed his Glory and Man's Happine&s;s; therefore he willed and decreed the Means to it: The end and moving Cau&s;e of his willing Sin to be, is for his Glory, which Cau&s;e it was nece&s;&s;ary for Sin to be; if Sin had not been, how &s;hould the Goodne&s;s of God in giv|ing Man Eternal Life in Glory appeared, his Love in &s;end|ing Chri&s;t to die? If there had not been Sin, there had been no need of Chri&s;t's comming, nor of his Death and Righteou&s;|ne&s;s; mo&s;t of the great Works of God in this World and that to come, have Dependance or Reference to Sin; how &s;hould we have lived by Faith, exerci&s;ed the Fruits of the Spirit, or have any Happine&s;s or Glory in the World to come, if it had not been for Chri&s;t? And Chri&s;t had not been, if there had been no Sin: He that willeth the End, willeth tho&s;e things that are nece&s;&s;arily referr'd to that End, Taking away Sin was decreed before the World, therefore the Being of Sin was decreed; Chri&s;t's Death was determined before the World; for the End of Chri&s;t was to re&s;tore <HI>Adam</HI>'s Fall. If <HI>Adam</HI> had not fallen, there had been no need of a Chri&s;t to re&s;tore him: The Saints were cho&s;en to Life before the World; Choice hath Reference to the Fall, therefore the fall of <HI>Adam</HI> was decreed: If the Will of Man had been the fir&s;t and chief Cau&s;e of the being of Sin, then the Will of Man &s;hould be the Cau&s;e of God's Will, and &s;o Men &s;hould be the

original Cau&s;e of the Salvation of him&s;elf, and &s;o much the Cau&s;e of it, that without his will it could not have been: and &s;o the Determination of God what to do, &s;hall not be from him&s;elf, but from the Will of Man, which is contrary to <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.11. if Men &s;hould will Sin before God willed it, then &s;hall the Will of God depend and wait upon the Will of Man: as if God &s;hould &s;ay, If Man will Sin, then I will his Salvation: And if God &s;hould fir&s;t will to &s;end Chri&s;t to &s;ave Man, and leave it to Mans Will and Power whether he &s;hall fall or no, then it was po|&s;&s;ible for Man to &s;tand, and &s;o to fru&s;trate the Decree of God: For if Man had not &s;inned, God's Decree of &s;ending Chri&s;t had been void and of none Effect: Mr <HI>Perkins</HI> &s;aith, God Decree the fall of <HI>Adam</HI>; if the fall was decreed, if Man had Power to Stand, then he had Power to fru&s;trate God's Decree, which no wi&s;e Man will affirm; and then that &s;aying that <HI>Adam</HI> had Power to keep the Law, is with|out truth; if he had, con&s;ider <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18.2,3,4. <HI>Je.</HI> 3.29,36. God willeth all things well, he &s;inneth not, nor can Sin, becau&s;e he is under no Law, God commands Men to keep the Law, that no Man can do; he commands Men to think no vain Thoughts, and not to &s;in; we cannot but think &s;ome vain Thoughts, and in many Things we Sin all Chri&s;t &s;aith, <HI>No man can come to me except the Father draw him,</HI> John 6.44.37. if they be drawn they come; <HI>draw us and we will run after thee,</HI> Cant. 1.4. if I put &s;ufficient Strength to move the Earth, Motion mu&s;t needs follow; when Men &s;in they are beguiled, enticed, deceived, drawn away, <HI>they like men have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed,</HI> Ho&s;. 6.7.</P>
<P>We are to di&s;tingui&s;h between that which followeth a Doctrine in its own Nature, and that which followeth by Accident, or rather that a corrupt Heart draweth from it, and is not from the Nature and Working of the Doctrine it &s;elf; it is &s;trange to con&s;ider Men are to &s;et upon the Popi&s;h Principle to be &s;aved for their Works, that they count all Prophane&s;s that cro&s;&s;eth their Way; &s;ome have burned the Bible; and Doctor <HI>Cri&s;p</HI>'s Book of Salvation by Chri&s;t alone, Mr. <HI>Archers</HI> late of <HI>Allhallowes London,</HI> his Treati&s;e of Comfort to beleivers, again&s;t their Sins and Sor|row, was burnt by the Hangman; the &s;ame Spirit is alive to burn this al&s;o. I expect no better from &s;uch as are not taught of God; they condemn tho&s;e Things they know not, and think they do God Service, when they per&s;ecute the Truth and Profe&s;&s;ors of it.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="30">Take for In&s;tance, that the Fear of the Torments of Hell is no &s;uch Pre&s;erver again&s;t Sin, is evident; for tho&s;e that &s;in with the greate&s;t Greedine&s;s, the greate&s;t Sinners, they do believe there are Hell Torments? For tho' they be never &s;o wicked, they hope it doth not belong to them; or they hope to repent and lead new Lives, before they die; though they &s;in for the pre&s;ent, they hope to make God amends for all, as an <HI>Arminian</HI> being drunk, &s;aith, that he was now in the State of Damnation, but he &s;aid he would be in the State of Grace to morrow, &s;o he comforted him|&s;elf. The Lives of many Heathens that have denied the Re&s;urrection of the Body, and therefore did not hold a Hell of Torment after, have been better than many that &s;eek to e&s;cape Hell, and get Heaven by their Works.</P>
<P N="2">2. If Fear of Hell were a Pre&s;erver again&s;t Sin, then tho&s;e that are delivered from the Fear of Hell, that believe they &s;hall be &s;aved, they &s;hould Sin more than others; but we find the contrary, that none more free from Sin than the&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">3. Experience teacheth, that the Fear of Hell, though at fir&s;t it &s;tartleth and frighteth Men, yet that is &s;oon over, and is no Pre&s;erver again&s;t Sin. I knew one &s;et before him the Torments of Hell to keep him from Sin, and finding that would not do, he added Vows and Cur&s;es to keep him from Sin. I knew another wi&s;hed the Devil to take him Soul and Body, if he did not do the thing he &s;pake of, and I knew he did it not: Another wi&s;hed he might &s;ink into Hell pre&s;ently if he did the thing he &s;pake of, yet did do it before he went from the Place; the Rea&s;on is, be|cau&s;e the Lu&s;ts of Men are &s;tronger than the Fear of Hell, Re&s;olutions and Cur&s;es.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e Men are given up to their own Hearts Lu&s;ts; it may be that they may find that Liberty to Sin is the greate&s;t Mi&s;ery and Bondage in the World, it hath all mi&s;ery in it, whether they Sin with more or le&s;s Fear, and could enjoy all the Plea&s;ures of Sin for a Sea&s;on, they will find they have made a bad Bargain of it. <HI>What fruit had ye of tho&s;e things whereof ye are now a&s;hamed?</HI> Rom. 6.21. <HI>If I &s;in thou marke&s;t me,</HI> Job. 10.14. <HI>Be &s;ure your &s;in will find you out,</HI> Numbers 32.23. <HI>In keeping thy commands there is great reward,</HI> P&s;al. 19.11.

Mr. <HI>Bolton</HI> &s;aith, they &s;hall &s;uffer &s;o long as God is God, if &s;o, then they have eternal Life (though in Mi&s;ery) whereas the Scripture doth not declare eternal Life to be for all Men, <HI>John</HI> 6.45,47. <HI>Pro|mi&s;ed us eternal life,</HI> 1 John 2.17.25. <HI>I give unto them eter|nal life to as many as thou ha&s;t given him,</HI> John 17.2,3. <HI>in hope of eternal life,</HI> John 3.15. <HI>As many as were ordained to eternal life believed,</HI> Act. 13.48. <HI>they that have done good unto the re&s;urrection of life,</HI> John 5.29. If it be granted that the Wicked have not eternal Life, as hath been pro|ved, it will follow, that they cannot &s;uffer for ever &s;o long as God is God; and therefore all their building of a Pu|ni&s;hment never to end fails, grant the fir&s;t and the later mu&s;t needs follow.</P>
<P>If <HI>Adam</HI> had not &s;inned, he &s;hould have died; this is proved fir&s;t, becau&s;e <HI>Adam</HI> in his Creation had a natural Body, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.44. that which is natural is not eternal, <HI>v.</HI> 46.

<P>Secondly, Man in his fir&s;t being was corporal and vi&s;ible to be &s;een; things &s;een are not eternal.

<P>Thirdly, Man in Innocency needed Food, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that which depends upon mutable and earthly Things, is earthly and mutable; we &s;ee it in all other Creatures that live up|on peri&s;hing things, at la&s;t peri&s;h; and herein Man by the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> hath no Preeminence above a Bea&s;t: Heaven

<P>If <HI>Adam</HI> had not died, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.12. he &s;hould have continu|ed in this World, he &s;hould not have gone to the World to come; therefore by his Fall he lo&s;t no Happine&s;s nor eter|nal Life in that World; for he could not by that Fall lo&s;e more than he had, and was to have. Death is according to Nature, but to attain Immortality is above Nature. <HI>Adam</HI> being Earth and from the Earth, his Enjoyment, Life, and Lo&s;s, and Puni&s;hment, mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity, be earthly; how cometh he then by his Fall to be capable of a Puni&s;hment never to end, unle&s;s by his Fall he could purcha&s;e eternal Life, which none will affirm? Eternal Life cannot be by the fir&s;t Man, much le&s;s by Sin.</P>
<P>I deny not but the <HI>wages of &s;in is death,</HI> Rom. 6.23. There is difference to be put between a natural Death and a judici|al Death; the fir&s;t is from nature, the &s;econd is from Sin, if the common Death that all die, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9.27. were the Puni&s;h|ment of Sin, as mo&s;t Men think, then Chri&s;t, by freeing his from the Puni&s;hment of Sin, by bearing Death for them, of Nece&s;&s;ity he mu&s;t free them from dying a natural Death, but Chri&s;t freeth not his from a natural Death, yet freeth them from the Puni&s;hment of Sin; therefore to die the common Death is no Part of the Puni&s;hment of Sin: For where Sin is &s;atisfied, or pardoned, or forgiven, the Puni&s;hment is not inflicted; if it be, how is it for|given? Even Men when they pardon inflict not the Pu|ni&s;hment; all confe&s;s, &s;ome Mens Sins are pardoned, how then cometh it to pa&s;s that they die for Sin, who&s;e Sin is pardoned? (He that keepeth my &s;aying &s;hall not &s;ee Death) <HI>John</HI> 15.21. is not to be referred to a natural Death, but to peri&s;h, a judicial Death, <HI>John</HI> 3.16. the Scripture declares, that there &s;hall be a Re&s;urrection of the Dead, the Ju&s;t and Unju&s;t, <HI>Acts</HI> 24.15. the Unju&s;t would enter into Life, but &s;hall not, <HI>John</HI> 5.20.

Chri&s;t &s;aith, <HI>Let not your Hearts be troubled,</HI> John 14.1. the fear of Hell doeth greatly trouble the Hearts of many; it is Gods Will to com|fort the &s;ad, to relea&s;e tho&s;e that are bound, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 61.1,2.3,4. and 40.5,9. <HI>a word fitly &s;poken, is like apples of Gold in pictures in Silver,</HI> Prov. 25.11.</P>
<P>4. Fear di&s;tracts, and greatly di&s;courageth the Soul, hin|ders Faith; that which freeth the Soul from Fear, fits the Soul to &s;erve <HI>God without fear, in holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, all the days of our lives,</HI> Luke 1.74.</P>
<P>5. Fear unfits and di&s;ableth the Soul to every good Work to God or Man: Fear unfits for any outward occa&s;ion: Fear is a weight that depre&s;&s;es the Soul, and makes it
<PB N="48" REF="47">
weak, it &s;traitneth the Heart; but Hope comforteth and enlargeth it.</P>
<P>The Opinion of Hell Torments, provokes the Soul to envy and Unbelief, and hinders Subjection to God; if the Soul apprehends it &s;elf liable to &s;o great and everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment, it cannot &s;ubmit to God (nor be quiet.) This cau&s;ed <HI>Francis Spira</HI> to wi&s;h he were above God; The Light of this Truth cau&s;eth the Soul le&s;s to &s;in, and le&s;s to be troubled, to have le&s;s hard Thoughts of God, and le&s;s to fret again&s;t the Lord.</P>
<P>7. Their Opinion cau&s;es an exceeding and unrea&s;onable trouble of Mind and melancholy; &s;uch Trouble is Sin, <HI>John</HI> 13.1. [a merry heart doeth good, <HI>Prov.</HI> 17.22,] the Knowledge of the Truth herein ea&s;eth the fearful Mind, and cau&s;es, as it were, a Heaven upon Earth.</P>
<P>8. Their Opinion hath cau&s;ed many to murder them|&s;elves in taking away their own Lives by Poy&s;on, Stab|bing, Drowning, Hanging, Strangling and Shooting them|&s;elves, ca&s;ting them&s;elves out of Windows, and from high Places to break their Necks, and by other Deaths, that they might not live to encrea&s;e their Sin, and encrea&s;e their Torments in Hell.</P>
<P>9. Their Opinion provoketh to the greate&s;t Sins, as De&s;pair: Al&s;o to the Wickedne&s;s that the World lieth in, namely, working for Life, to do Duties to e&s;cape Hell and get Heaven, which is to <HI>tread under foot the blood of Chri&s;t as an unholy thing,</HI> Heb. 10.29. in &s;eeking to be ju&s;tifi|ed by the Law of Works, and not alone by the perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>Rev.</HI> 1.5. <HI>Jer.</HI> 23.6. <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.10,14.</P>
<P>10. Freedom from Fear cau&s;eth Love; Love cau&s;eth Ser|vice; <HI>the love of Chri&s;t con&s;traineth</HI>; it tends to the Comfort of many that through Weakne&s;s of Faith give way to Sa|tans Temptations; to fear the Torments of Hell cau&s;eth a feeble Mind; <HI>comfort the feeble mind,</HI> 1 The&s;. 5.14. Its a comfort to many who&s;e Children and Friends die and leave no Te&s;timony of their Conver&s;ion, the Fear that they are to &s;uffer &s;o great and endle&s;s Torment hath great|ly &s;added and troubled the Heart of many a Parent and Friend.</P>

<P N="8"><HI>Proof</HI> VIII. It is not agreeable to the God of Nature, to go contrary to the Law of Nature, that he hath written in Mankind; there is planted in Man an univer&s;al Love to Man, e&s;pecially to their Off-&s;pring, be they obedient or di&s;obedient; what Bowels of Love is there in Parents to their Off-&s;pring, when in Mi&s;ery, and to others in Mi&s;e|ry and Want? Sure no Man doth de&s;ire any Man nor Creature to indure the Torment they &s;peak of one Year, much le&s;s their own Off-&s;pring; how then may I, or can I, think &s;o of God, to be le&s;s pitiful, le&s;s merciful then cru|el Man, (<HI>Jer.</HI> 50.24. and <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 4.1.) to his Off-&s;pring? we are all his Off-&s;pring, <HI>Acts</HI> 17.28. &s;ure God exceeds Man in Goodne&s;s; if ye which are evil know how to give good things to your Children, how much more &s;hall your heavenly Father give good Things to them that ask him? <HI>Matth.</HI> 7.8,9,10,11. Thou Lord art good and doe&s;t good, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119.68. <HI>Matth.</HI> 5.45. though they were e|vil, and did evil, God did good and gave Rain, <HI>Acts</HI> 14.17. They &s;ay the Fire, <HI>Dan.</HI> 3.21. is nothing to Hell, and that the greate&s;t Torment Man can devi&s;e, is &s;carce a Sha|dow to that in Hell, by which they declare God to be more cruel than Man.</P>
<P N="9"><HI>Proof</HI> IX. If Man had de&s;erved &s;o great puni&s;hment, why may not God &s;hew that mercy as not to inflict it, as well as to let his Sun to &s;hine, and his Rain to fall on them that no way de&s;erve it, &s;eeing he could (if he &s;o plea&s;ed) hin|der it? we do &s;ee Men &s;hew more kindne&s;s to a rebellious and di&s;obedient Child then he de&s;erveth; may not God do the &s;ame, &s;o much as God is greater than Man, &s;o much greater is his Mercy, Love, and Goodne&s;s, than that in Man, yea than that that is or ever was in all Men; all that came from him, and all is but the lea&s;t drop to that great Sea and Ocean of Mercy and Love that is in him; how little a portion is heard of him? <HI>Job.</HI> 24.14.

<P N="10"><HI>Proof</HI> X.

God hath commanded us to do good to all, he that hath two Coats is to impart to him that hath none, and he that hath Meat mu&s;t do &s;o likewi&s;e, <HI>Luke</HI> 3.11. all which doth hold forth God's good Will and Care to Mankind, he that would not have them &s;uffer the Torment of Mi&s;ery and Want, that taketh care to prevent that little and &s;hort Mi&s;ery, will not impo&s;e a far greater never to end.</P>
<P N="11"><HI>Proof</HI> XI. Their Opinion le&s;&s;eneth the Goodne&s;s of God, and limiteth to a few, whereas the Scripture declares it to be to all, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5. The Creature it &s;elf &s;hall be deli|vered from the Bondage of Corruption, into the glorious Liberty of the Sons of God, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.19.

from their Bondage, for which deliverance they groan: are not all Angels and Men, obedient or di&s;obedient, the Cre|ation of God? if &s;o, the wor&s;t &s;hall partake of the liberty of the Sons of God: as the whole Creation came from God, or rather is in God, for in him we live, it &s;hall be taken up into the &s;ame Glory, a good the larger it is the better, if it be good to &s;hew Mercy to &s;ome, is it not more good to have mercy on all? <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.18. <HI>Plato</HI> could &s;ay, God be|ing a &s;upreme Good, there was no Envy in him to any of his Creatures, but rather a de&s;ire that all might be made like him: This is &s;o great and glorious a di&s;covery of God, and that all Men are in God; for in him we live, and move, and have our being, as certain al&s;o of your own Poets have &s;aid, for we are all his off-&s;pring, <HI>Acts</HI> 17.28. I have won|dred how the Heathen Poets came to know this Truth, &s;ure God did manife&s;t it to them: If all Men are in God, all Men are in Chri&s;t; for Chri&s;t &s;aith, [I and my Father are one] <HI>John</HI> 10.30 Al&s;o if all Men are in God, for in him we live and move, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> if &s;o, then all Men are in Chri&s;t; for God was in Chri&s;t reconciling the World to him&s;elf, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.9.

Such Torment, of &s;uch continuance, in the la&s;t agree not to the gracious mind and merciful heart of a Saint; he de&s;ires not any Man nor Creature to be in &s;uch Torment an Hour: therefore it doth no way agree to the Mind of God: we find the more the Lord manife&s;ts him&s;elf in any, the more their Minds and Spirit are humb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, the more living and merciful they are, even to their Enemies, and can do them Good for Evil.</P>
<P N="13"><HI>Proof</HI> XIII. Such Torments do not in the lea&s;t agree to the Mind and Will of Chri&s;t; Chri&s;t is full of Love and Mercy to the wor&s;t Men; it was truly &s;aid of Chri&s;t [He was a friend to Publicans and Sinners] He, the be&s;t friend to them that ever was; when they crucified him, he &s;aid [Father forgive them] <HI>Luke</HI> 23.34.

He that will by no means &s;uffer his Enemies to &s;uffer a &s;hort Death by Fire, will not inflict upon them a more ter|rible Fire never to end; ye may know the mind of God by the mind of Chri&s;t, for Chri&s;t is God, alike equal, <HI>Acts</HI> 28. <HI>Heb.</HI> 1.3. and as one [I and my Father are one] <HI>John</HI> 10.30.</P>
<P N="14"><HI>Proof</HI> XIV.

[The words of the pure are plea&s;ant words] <HI>Prov.</HI> 15.25. good words, com|fortable words; the holy Spirit is called a Comforter, not a Tormenter, the pure Spirit of Love &s;ends forth only Love and Sweetne&s;s.</P>
<P N="15"><HI>Proof</HI> XV. No &s;uch torment no way agrees to the na|ture of God; God is Love, 1 <HI>John</HI> 4.16. it is his nature, there is no anger nor fury in love; fury is not in me, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 27.4. God wills us to love enemies that abu&s;e, wrong and hate us; God will do &s;o much more, love his enemies, <HI>Luke</HI> 6.35. If God &s;hould only love them that love him,

<P>Chri&s;t did not purcha&s;e the love of God; he loved us be|fore the World began, and ever will, <HI>John</HI> 13.1.

<P N="18"><HI>Proof</HI> XVIII. God he is ju&s;t, therefore he will not do a|ny thing but that which is ju&s;t and right: the greate&s;t Pun|i&s;hment of the breach of his law is death; he will not in|flict another, much le&s;s a wor&s;er puni&s;hment then he hath expre&s;&s;ed in his Law: Ju&s;tice is in number, weight and mea&s;ure, God requires things equal; ye may &s;ee the mind of God in his command in forbidding any thing to be done but that which is equal and &s;uitable to the fact, as eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, &s;tripe for &s;tripe, <HI>Exod.</HI> 21.24,25,26. <HI>How much &s;he hath glorified her &s;elf, and lived deliciou&s;ly, &s;o much torment and &s;orrow give her,</HI> Rev. 18.7. <HI>What mea&s;ure you mete to others &s;hall be mea|&s;ured to you again</HI>: Murder, an horrible and grievous Sin, yet it is puni&s;hed with an equal Puni&s;hment in this Life, Life for Life; he that &s;heddeth Man's Blood, by Man &s;hall his Blood be &s;hed, <HI>Gen.</HI> 9.6.
