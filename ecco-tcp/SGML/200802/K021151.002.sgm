<HEAD>BOOK VII. <HI>Containing three Days.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>A Compari&s;on between the World and the Stage.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE World hath been often compared to the Theatre; and many grave Writers, as well as the Poets, have con&s;idered human Life as a great Drama, re&s;embling, in almo&s;t every Particular, tho&s;e &s;cenical Repre&s;en|tations, which <HI>The&s;pis</HI> is fir&s;t reported to have invented, and which have been &s;ince received with &s;o much Approbation and Delight in all polite Countries.</P>
<P>This Thought hath been carried &s;o far, and be|come &s;o general, that &s;ome Words proper to the Theatre, and which were, at fir&s;t, metaphorically applied to the World, are now indi&s;criminately and literally &s;poken of both: Thus Stage and Scene are by common U&s;e grown as familiar to us, when we
<PB N="2" REF="11">
&s;peak of Life in general, as when we confine our|&s;elves to dramatic Performances; and when we men|tion Tran&s;actions behind the Curtain, <HI>St. James's</HI> is more likely to occur to our Thoughts than <HI>Drury-Lane.</HI></P>
<P>It may &s;eem ea&s;y enough to account for all this, by reflecting that the theatrical Stage is nothing more than a Repre&s;entation, or, as <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> calls it, an Imitation of what really exi&s;ts; and hence, perhaps, we might fairly pay a very high Compliment to tho&s;e, who by their Writings or Actions have been &s;o ca|pable of imitating Life, as to have their Pictures, in a Manner confounded with, or mi&s;taken for the Ori|ginals.</P>
<P>But, in Reality, we are not &s;o fond of paying Compliments to the&s;e People, whom we u&s;e as Chil|dren frequently do the In&s;truments of their Amu&s;e|ments; and have much more Plea&s;ure in hi&s;&s;ing and buffeting them, than in admiring their Excellence. There are many other Rea&s;ons which have induced us to &s;ee this Analogy between the World and the Stage.</P>
<P>Some have con&s;idered the larger Part of Mankind in the light of Actors, as per&s;onating Characters no more their own, and to which, in Fact, they have no better Title, than the Player hath to be in Earne&s;t thought the King or Emperor whom he repre&s;ents. Thus the Hypocrite may be &s;aid to be a Player; and indeed the <HI>Greeks</HI> called them both by one and the &s;ame Name.</P>
<P>The Brevity of Life hath likewi&s;e given Occa&s;ion to this Compari&s;on. So the immortal <HI>Shake&s;pear.</HI></P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Life's a poor Player,</L>
<L>That &s;torms and &s;truts his Hour upon the Stage,</L>
<L>And then is heard no more.</L></Q>
<P>For which hackneyed Quotation, I will make the Reader Amends by a very noble one, which few, I
<PB N="3" REF="12">
believe, have read. It is taken from a Poem called the DEITY, publi&s;hed about nine Years ago, and long &s;ince buried in Oblivion. A Proof that good Books no more than good Men do always &s;urvive the bad.</P>
<Q><L><HI>From thee</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The DEITY.</NOTE> <HI>all human Actions take their Spring</HI></L>
<L><HI>The ri&s;e of Empires, and the Fall of Kings!</HI></L>
<L><HI>See the</HI> VAST THEATRE OF TIME <HI>di&s;play'd,</HI></L>
<L><HI>While o'er the Scene &s;ucceeding Heraes tread!</HI></L>
<L><HI>With Pomp the &s;hining Images &s;ucceed,</HI></L>
<L><HI>What Leaders triumph, and what Monarchs bleed!</HI></L>
<L><HI>Perform the Parts thy Providence a&s;&s;ign'd,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Their Pride their Pa&s;&s;ions to thy Ends inclin'd:</HI></L>
<L><HI>A while they glitter in the Face of Day,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Then at thy Nod the Phantoms pa&s;s away;</HI></L>
<L><HI>No Traces left of all the bu&s;y Scene,</HI></L>
<L><HI>But that Remembrance &s;ays&mdash;</HI>THE THINGS HAVE BEEN!</L></Q>
<P>In all the&s;e, however, and in every other Similitude of Life to the Theatre, the Re&s;emblance hath been always taken from the Stage only. None, as I re|member, have at all con&s;idered the Audience at this great Drama.</P>
<P>But as nature often exhibits &s;ome of her be&s;t Per|formances to a very full Hou&s;e; &s;o will the Beha|viour of our Spectators no le&s;s admit the above men|tioned Compari&s;on than that of her Actors. In this va&s;t Theatre of Time are &s;eated the Friend and the Critic; here are Claps and Shouts, Hi&s;&s;es and Groans; in &s;hort, every Thing which was ever &s;een or heard at the Theatre Royal.</P>
<P>Let us examine this in one Example: For In|&s;tance, in the Behaviour of the great Audience on that Scene which Nature was plea&s;ed to exhibit in the 12th Chapter of the preceding Book, where &s;he
<PB N="4" REF="13">
introduced <HI>Black George</HI> running away with the <HI>500l.</HI> from his Friend and Benefactor.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who &s;at in the World's upper Gallery, treat|ed that Incident, I am well convinced, with their u&s;ual Vociferation; and every Term of &s;currilous Reproach was mo&s;t probably vented on that Oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P>If we had de&s;cended to the next Order of Specta|tors, we &s;hould have found an equal Degree of Ab|horrence, tho' le&s;s of Noi&s;e and Scurrility; yet here the good Women gave <HI>Black George</HI> to the Devil, and many of them expected every Minute that the cloven-footed Gentleman would fetch his own.</P>
<P>The Pit, as u&s;ual, was no doubt divided: Tho&s;e who delight in heroic Virtue and perfect Character, objected to the producing &s;uch In&s;tances of Villainy, without puni&s;hing them very &s;everely for the Sake of Example. Some of the Author's Friends, cry'd&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'Look'e, Gentlemen, the Man is a Villain; but it is Nature for all that.'</Q> And all the young Critics of the Age, the Clerks, Apprentices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> called it Low, and fell a Groaning.</P>
<P>As for the Boxes, they behaved with their ac|cu&s;tomed Politene&s;s. Mo&s;t of them were attending to &s;omething el&s;e. Some of tho&s;e few who regarded the Scene at all, declared he was a bad Kind of Man; while others refu&s;ed to give their opinion 'till they had heard the be&s;t Judges.</P>
<P>Now we, who are admitted behind the Scenes of this great Theatre of Nature, (and no Author ought to write any Thing be&s;ides Dictionaries and Spelling-Books who hath not this Privilege) can cen&s;ure the Action, without conceiving any ab&s;olute Dete&s;tation of the Per&s;on, whom perhaps Nature may not have de&s;igned to act an ill Part in all her Dramas: For in this In&s;tance, Life mo&s;t exactly re&s;embles the Stage, &s;ince it is often the &s;ame Per&s;on who repre&s;ents the Villain and the Heroe; and he who engages your
<PB N="5" REF="14">
Admiration To-day, will probably attract your Con|tempt To-Morrow. As <HI>Garrick,</HI> whom I regard in Tragedy to be the greate&s;t Genius the World hath ever produced, &s;ometimes conde&s;cends to play the Fool; &s;o did <HI>Scipio</HI> the Great and <HI>Laelius</HI> the Wi&s;e, according to <HI>Horace,</HI> many Years ago: nay, <HI>Cicero</HI> reports them to have been 'incredibly childi&s;h.'&mdash;The&s;e, it is true play'd the Fool, like my Friend <HI>Garrick,</HI> in Je&s;t only; but &s;everal eminent Characters have, in numberle&s;s In&s;tances of their Lives, played the Fool egregiou&s;ly in Earne&s;t; &s;o far as to render it a Matter of &s;ome Doubt, whether their Wi&s;dom or Folly was predominant; or whether they were better intitled to the Applau&s;e or Cen&s;ure, the Ad|miration or Contempt, the Love or Hatred of Man|kind.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Per&s;ons, indeed, who have pa&s;&s;ed any Time behind the Scenes of this great Theatre, and are thoroughly acquainted not only with the &s;everal Di&s;|gui&s;es which are there put on, but al&s;o with the fan|ta&s;tic and capricious Behaviour of the Pa&s;&s;ions who are the Managers and Directors of this Theatre, (for as to Rea&s;on the Patentee, he is known to be a very idle Fellow, and &s;eldom to exert him&s;elf) may mo&s;t probably have learned to con&s;true the famous <HI>Nil admirari</HI> of <HI>Horace,</HI> or in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Phra&s;e, <HI>To &s;tare at nothing.</HI></P>
<P>A &s;ingle bad Act no more con&s;titutes a Villain in Life, than a &s;ingle bad Part on the Stage. The Pa&s;|&s;ions, like the Managers of a Playhou&s;e, often force Men upon Parts, without con&s;ulting their Judgment, and &s;ometimes without any Regard to their Talents. Thus the Man, as well as the Player, may condemn what he him&s;elf acts; nay, it is common to &s;ee Vice &s;it as awkwardly on &s;ome Men, as the Character of <HI>Iago</HI> would on the hone&s;t Face of Mr. <HI>William Mills.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="15">
Upon the whole then, the Man of Candour and of true Under&s;tanding, is never ha&s;ty to condemn. He can cen&s;ure an Imperfection, or even a Vice, without Rage again&s;t the guilty Party. In a Word, they are the &s;ame Folly, the &s;ame Childi&s;hne&s;s, the &s;ame Ill-breeding, and the &s;ame Ill-nature, which rai&s;e all the Clamours and Uproars both in Life and on the Stage. The wor&s;t of Men generally have the Words <HI>Rogue</HI> and <HI>Villain</HI> mo&s;t in their Mouths, as the low|e&s;t of all Wretches are the apte&s;t to cry out <HI>low</HI> in the Pit.</P>

<P>Many contending Pa&s;&s;ions were rai&s;ed in our He|roe's Mind by this Letter; but the Tender prevailed at la&s;t over the Indignant and Ira&s;cible, and a Flood of Tears came &s;ea&s;onably to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and po&s;|&s;ibly prevented his Misfortunes from either turning his Head, or bur&s;ting his Heart.</P>
<P>He grew, however &s;oon a&s;hamed of indulging this Remedy; and &s;tarting up, he cried, <Q REND="inline">'Well then, I will give Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> the only In&s;tance he re|quires of my Obedience. I will go this Moment&mdash;but whither?&mdash;why let Fortune direct; &s;ince there is no other who thinks it of any Con&s;equence what becomes of this wretched Per&s;on, it &s;hall be a Matter of equal Indifference to my&s;elf. Shall I alone regard what no other?&mdash;Ha! have I not Rea&s;on to think there is another?&mdash;One who&s;e Value is above that of the whole World!&mdash;I may, I mu&s;t imagine my <HI>Sophia</HI> is not indifferent to what becomes of me. Shall I then leave this only Friend&mdash;and &s;uch a Friend? Shall I not &s;tay with her?&mdash;Where? How can I &s;tay with her? Have I any Hopes of even &s;eeing her, tho' &s;he was as de&s;irous as my&s;elf, without ex|po&s;ing her to the Wrath of her Father? And to what Purpo&s;e? Can I think of &s;oliciting &s;uch a Crea|ture to Con&s;ent to her own Ruin? Shall I indulge any Pa&s;&s;ion of mine at &s;uch a Price?&mdash;Shall I lurk about this Country like a Thief, with &s;uch In|tentions?&mdash;No, I di&s;dain, I dete&s;t the Thought. Farewel, <HI>Sophia;</HI> farewel mo&s;t lovely, mo&s;t be|loved&mdash;'</Q> Here Pa&s;&s;ion &s;topped his Mouth, and found a Vent at his Eyes.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="17">
And now, having taken a Re&s;olution to leave the Country, he began to debate with him&s;elf whither he &s;hould go. <HI>The World,</HI> as <HI>Milton</HI> phra&s;es it, <HI>lay all before him;</HI> and <HI>Jones</HI> no more than <HI>Adam,</HI> had any Man to whom he might re&s;ort for Comfort or A&s;&s;i&s;tance. All his Acquaintance were the Acquain|tance of Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> and he had no Rea&s;on to expect any Countenance from them, as that Gentle|man had withdrawn his Favour from him. Men of great and good Characters &s;hould indeed be very cau|tious how they di&s;card their Dependents; for the Con|&s;equence to the unhappy Sufferer is being di&s;carded by all others.</P>
<P>What Cour&s;e of Life to pur&s;ue, or to what Bu|&s;ine&s;s to apply him&s;elf, was a &s;econd Con&s;ideration; and here the Pro&s;pect was all a melancholy Void. Every profe&s;&s;ion, and every Trade, required Length of Time, and what was wor&s;e, Money; for Matters are &s;o Con&s;tituted that 'Nothing out of Nothing' is not a truer Maxim in Phy&s;ics than in Politics; and e|very Man who is greatly de&s;titute of Money is on that Account entirely excluded from all Means of ac|quiring it.</P>
<P>At la&s;t the Ocean, that ho&s;pitable Friend to the Wretched, opened her capacious Arms to receive him; and he in&s;tantly re&s;olved to accept her kind In|vitation. To expre&s;s my&s;elf le&s;s figuratively, he de|termined to go to Sea.</P>
<P>This Thought indeed no &s;ooner &s;ugge&s;ted it&s;elf, than he eagerly embraced it; and having pre&s;ently hired Hor&s;es, he &s;et out for <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> to put it in Ex|ecution.</P>
<P>But before we attend him on his Expedition, we &s;hall re&s;ort a while to Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI>'s, and &s;ee what farther happened to the charming <HI>Sophia.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>Containing &s;everal Dialogues.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Morning in which Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> departed, Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> &s;ummoned <HI>Sophia</HI> into her A|partment, and having fir&s;t accquainted her that &s;he had obtained her Liberty of her Father, &s;he proceeded to read her a long Lecture on the Subject of Matri|mony; which &s;he treated not as a romantic Scheme of Happine&s;s ari&s;ing from Love, as it hath been de|&s;cribed by the Poets; nor did &s;he mention any of tho&s;e Purpo&s;es for which we are taught by Divines to re|gard it as in&s;tituted by &s;acred Authority; &s;he con|&s;idered it rather as a Fund in which prudent Women depo&s;ited their Fortunes to the be&s;t Advantage, in order to receive a larger Intere&s;t for them, than they could have el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>When Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> had fini&s;hed, <HI>Sophia</HI> an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">'that &s;he was very incapable of arguing with a Lady of her Aunt's &s;uperior Knowledge and Experience, e&s;pecially on a Subject which &s;he had &s;o very little con&s;idered, as this of Matrimony.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Argue with me, Child!' replied the other, 'I did not indeed expect it. I &s;hould have &s;een the World to very little Purpo&s;e truly, if I am to ar|gue with one of your Years. I have taken this Trouble, in order to in&s;truct you. The ancient Philosophers, &s;uch as <HI>Socrates, Alcibiades,</HI> and o|thers, did not u&s;e to argue with their Scholars. You are to con&s;ider me, Child, as <HI>Socrates,</HI> not a&s;king your Opinion, but only informing you of mine.'</Q> From which la&s;t Words the Reader may po&s;&s;ibly imagine, that this Lady had read no more of the Philo&s;ophy of <HI>Socrates,</HI> than &s;he had of that of <HI>Alcibiades;</HI> and indeed we cannot re&s;olve his Curio&s;ity as to this Point.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><PB N="10" REF="19">
'Madam,' cries <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'I have never pre&s;umed to controvert any Opinion of yours, and this Sub|ject, as I &s;aid, I have never yet thought of, and perhaps never may.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Indeed <HI>Sophy,'</HI> replied the Aunt, 'this Di&s;&s;imu|lation with me is very fooli&s;h. The <HI>French</HI> &s;hall as &s;oon per&s;uade me, that they take foreign Towns in Defence only of their own Country, as you can impo&s;e on me to believe you have never yet thought &s;eriou&s;ly of Matrimony. How can you, Child, affect to deny that you have con&s;idered of contract|ing an Alliance, when you &s;o well know I am ac|quainted with the Party with whom you de&s;ire to contract it. An Alliance as unnatural, and con|trary to your Intere&s;t, as a &s;eparate League with the <HI>French</HI> would be to the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Dutch!</HI> But however, if you have not hitherto con&s;idered of this Matter, I promi&s;e you it is now high Time; for my Brother is re&s;olved immediately to conclude the Treaty with Mr. <HI>Blifil;</HI> and indeed I am a &s;ort of Guarantee in the Affair, and have promi&s;ed your Concurrence.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Madam,' cries <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'this is the only In&s;tance in which I mu&s;t di&s;obey both your&s;elf and my Father. For this is a Match which requires very little Con&s;ideration in me to refu&s;e.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'If I was not as great a Philo&s;opher as <HI>Socrates</HI> him&s;elf,' returned Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> 'you would over|come my Patience. What Objection can you have to the young Gentleman?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'A very &s;olid Objection, in my Opinion,' &s;ays <HI>Sophia,&mdash;'</HI>I hate him.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Will you never learn a proper U&s;e of Words?' an&s;wered the Aunt. 'Indeed Child, you &s;hould con|&s;ult <HI>Bailey</HI>'s <HI>Dictionary.</HI> It is impo&s;&s;ible you &s;hould hate a Man from whom you have received no In|jury. By Hatred, therefore, you mean no more than Di&s;like, which is no &s;ufficient Objection again&s;t
<PB N="11" REF="20">
marrying of him. I have known many Couples, who have entirely di&s;liked each other, lead very comfortable, genteel lives. Believe me, Child, I know the&s;e Things better than you. You will al|low me, I think, to have &s;een the World, in which I have not an Acquaintance who would not rather be thought to di&s;like her Hu&s;band, than to like him. The contrary is &s;uch out-of-Fa&s;hion romantic Non|&s;en&s;e, that the very imagination of it is &s;hocking.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Madam,' replied <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'I &s;hall never marry a Man I di&s;like. If I promi&s;e my Father ne|ver to con&s;ent to any Marriage contrary to his In|clinations, I think I may hope he will never force me into that State contrary to my own.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Inclinations!' cries the Aunt with &s;ome Warmth. 'Inclinations! I am a&s;toni&s;hed at your a&s;&s;urance. A young Woman of your Age, and unmarried, to talk of Inclinations! But whatever your Inclina|tions may be, my Brothar is re&s;olved; nay, &s;ince you talk of Inclinations, I &s;hall advi&s;e him to ha&s;ten the Treaty. Inclinations!</Q></P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> then flung her&s;elf upon her Knees, and Tears began to trickle from her &s;hining Eyes. She entreated her Aunt, <Q REND="inline">'to have Mercy upon her, and not to re&s;ent &s;o cruelly her Unwillingne&s;s to make her&s;elf mi&s;erable; often urging that &s;he alone was concerned, and that her Happine&s;s only was at Stake.'</Q></P>
<P>As a Bailiff, when well authori&s;ed by his Writ, having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the Per&s;on of &s;ome unhap|py Debtor, views all his Tears without concern: In vain the wretched Captive attempts to rai&s;e Com|pa&s;&s;ion; in vain the tender Wife bereft of her Com|panion, the little prattling Boy, or frighted Girl, are mentioned as inducements to Reluctance. The no|ble Bumtrap, blind and deaf, to every Circum&s;tance of Di&s;tre&s;s, greatly ri&s;es above all the Motives to Hu|manity,

and into the Hands of the Goaler re&s;olves to deliver his mi&s;erable Prey.</P>
<P>Not le&s;s blind to the Tears, or le&s;s deaf to every Entreaty of <HI>Sophia</HI> was the politic Aunt, nor le&s;s de|termined was &s;he to deliver over the trembling Maid into the Arms of the Goaler <HI>Blifil.</HI> She an&s;wered with great Impetuo&s;ity, <Q REND="inline">'So far, Madam, from your being concerned alone, your concern is the lea&s;t, or &s;urely the lea&s;t important. It is the Honour of your Family which is concerned in this Alliance; you are only the In&s;trument. Do you conceive, Mi&s;tre&s;s, that in an Intermarriage between King|doms, as when a Daughter of <HI>France</HI> is married into <HI>Spain,</HI> that the Prince&s;s her&s;elf is alone con|&s;idered in the Match? No, it is a match between two Kingdoms, rather than between two Per&s;ons. The &s;ame happens in great Families, &s;uch as ours. The Alliance between the Families is the Principal Matter. You ought to have a greater Regard for the Honour of your Family, than for your own Per&s;on; and if the Example of a Prince&s;s cannot in&s;pire you with the&s;e noble Thoughts, you cannot &s;urely complain at being u&s;ed no wor&s;e than all Prince&s;&s;es are u&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'I hope, Madam,' cries <HI>Sophia,</HI> with a little Ele|vation of Voice, 'I &s;hall never do any Thing to di&s;honour my Family; but as for Mr. <HI>Blifil,</HI> what|ever may be the Con&s;equence, I am re&s;olved again&s;t him, and no Force &s;hall prevail in his Favour.</Q></P>
<P><HI>We&s;tern,</HI> who had been within hearing during the greater Part of the preceding Dialogue, had now ex|hau&s;ted all his Patience; he therefore entered the Room in a violent Pa&s;&s;ion, crying, <Q REND="inline">'D&mdash;n me then if <HI>&s;hatunt</HI> ha' un, d&mdash;n me if <HI>&s;hatunt,</HI> that's all&mdash;that's all&mdash;D&mdash;n me if <HI>&s;hatunt.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> had collected a &s;ufficient Quantity of Wrath for the U&s;e of <HI>Sophia;</HI> but &s;he now transfer|ed it all to the Squire. <Q REND="inline">'Brother,' &s;aid &s;he, 'it is

a&s;toni&s;hing that you will interfere in a Matter which you had totally left to my Negotiation. Regard to my Family hath made me take upon my&s;elf to be the mediating Power, in order to rectify tho&s;e mi&s;takes in Policy which you have committed in your Daughter's Education. For, Brother, it is you; it is your prepo&s;terous Conduct which hath eradicated all the Seeds that I had formerly &s;own in her tender Mind.&mdash;It is your&s;elf who have taught her Di&s;|obedience.'</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'Blood!' cries the Squire, foaming at the Mouth, 'you are enough to conquer the Patience of the Devil! Have I ever taught my Daughter Di&s;obedience?&mdash;Here &s;he &s;tands; Speak hone&s;tly, Girl, did ever I bid you be di&s;obedient to me? Have I not done every thing to humour and to gratify you, and to make you obedient to me?

You have made a Whig of the Girl; and how &s;hould her Father, or any body el&s;e, expect any Obedience from her?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Brother,' an&s;wered Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> with an Air of great di&s;dain, 'I cannot expre&s;s the Contempt I have for your Politics of all Kinds; but I will appeal like|wi&s;e to the young Lady her&s;elf, whether I have ever taught her any Principles of Di&s;obedience. On the contrary, Niece, have I not endeavoured to in&s;pire you with a true Idea of the &s;everal Relations in which a human Creature &s;tands in Society? Have I not taken infinite Pains to &s;hew you, that the Law of Nature hath enjoined a Duty on Children to their Parents? Have I not told you what <HI>Plato</HI> &s;ays on that Subject?&mdash;A Subject on which you was &s;o notoriou&s;ly ignorant when you came fir&s;t under my Care, that I verily believe you did not know the Relation between a Daughter and a Father.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">' 'Tis

And whether it was this Word, or the Contempt expre&s;t for her Politics, which mo&s;t affected Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> I will not determine; but &s;he flew into the mo&s;t violent Rage, uttered Phra&s;es improper to be here related, and in&s;tantly bur&s;t out of the Hou&s;e.
<PB N="15" REF="24">
Nor did her Brother or her Niece think proper either to &s;top or to follow her: For the one was &s;o much po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Concern, and the other by Anger, that they were rendered almo&s;t motionle&s;s.</P>
<P>The Squire, however, &s;ent after his Si&s;ter the &s;ame Holla which attends the Departure of a Hare, when &s;he is fir&s;t &s;tarted before the Hounds. He was indeed a great Ma&s;ter of this Kind of Vociferation, and had a Holla proper for mo&s;t Occa&s;ions in Life.</P>
<P>Women who, like Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> know the World, and have applied them&s;elves to Philo&s;ophy and Poli|tics, would have immediately availed them&s;elves of the pre&s;ent Di&s;po&s;ition of Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI>'s Mind; by throwing in a few artful Compliments to his Under|&s;tanding at the Expence of his ab&s;ent Adver&s;ary; but poor <HI>Sophia</HI> was all Simplicity. By which Word we do not intend to in&s;inuate to the Reader, that &s;he was &s;illy, which is generally under&s;tood as a &s;ynonimous Term with &s;imple: For &s;he was indeed a mo&s;t &s;en&s;i|ble Girl, and her Under&s;tanding was of the fir&s;t Rate; but &s;he wanted all that u&s;eful Art which Females con|vert to &s;o many good Purpo&s;es in Life, and which, as it rather ari&s;es from the Heart, than from the Head, is often the Property of the &s;illie&s;t of Women.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>A Picture of a Country Gentlewoman taken from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Life.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MR. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> having fini&s;hed his Holla, and taken a little Breath, began to lament, in very pa|thetic Terms, the unfortunate Condition of Men, who are, &s;ays he, always <HI>whipt in</HI> by the Humours of &s;ome d&mdash;nd B&mdash;or other. I think I was <HI>hard run</HI> enough by your Mother for one Man; but after giving her a <HI>Dodge,</HI> here's another B&mdash;follows me upon the <HI>Foil;</HI> but cur&s;e my Jacket if I will be <HI>run down</HI> in this Manner by any o'um.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="25">
<HI>Sophia</HI> never had a &s;ingle Di&s;pute with her Father, till this unlucky Affair of <HI>Blifil,</HI> on any Account, except in Defence of her Mother, whom &s;he had loved mo&s;t tenderly, though &s;he lo&s;t her in the ele|venth Year of her Age. The Squire, to whom that poor Woman had been a faithful upper Servant all the Time of their Marriage, had returned that Beha|viour, by making what the World calls a good Hu&s;|band. He very &s;eldom &s;wore at her (perhaps not a|bove once a Week) and never beat her: She had not the lea&s;t Occa&s;ion for Jealou&s;y, and was perfect Mi|&s;tre&s;s of her Time: for &s;he was never interrupted by her Hu&s;band, who was engaged all the Morning in his Field Exerci&s;es, and all the Evening with Bottle-Com|panions. She &s;carce indeed ever &s;aw him but at Meals; where &s;he had the Plea&s;ure of carving tho&s;e Di&s;hes which &s;he had before attended at the Dre&s;&s;ing. From the&s;e Meals &s;he retired about five Minutes after the other Servants, having only &s;tayed to drink the King over the Water. Such were, it &s;eems, Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI>'s Orders: For it was a Maxim with him, that Women &s;hould come in with the fir&s;t Di&s;h, and go out after the fir&s;t Gla&s;s. Obedience to the&s;e Or|ders was perhaps no difficult Ta&s;k: For the Conver|&s;ation (if it may be called &s;o) was &s;eldom &s;uch as could entertain a Lady. It con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of Hol|lowing, Singing, Relations of &s;porting Adventures, B&mdash;d&mdash;y, and Abu&s;e of Women and of the Go|vernment.</P>
<P>The&s;e, however, were the only Sea&s;ons when Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> &s;aw his Wife: For when he repaired to her Bed, he was generally &s;o drunk that he could not &s;ee; and in the &s;porting Sea&s;on he always ro&s;e from her before it was light. Thus was &s;he perfect Mi&s;tre&s;s of her Time; and had be&s;ides a Coach and four u&s;ually at her Command; tho' unhappily indeed the Badne&s;s of the Neighbourhood, and of the Roads, made this of little U&s;e: For none who had &s;et much Value on
<PB N="17" REF="26">
their Necks would have pa&s;&s;ed through the one, or who had &s;et any Value on their Hours, would have vi&s;ited the other. Now to deal hone&s;tly with the Rea|der, &s;he did not make all the Return expected to &s;o much Indulgence: For &s;he had been married again&s;t her Will, by a fond Father, the Match having been rather advantageous on her Side: For the Squire's E&s;tate was upwards of 3000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, and her For|tune no more than a bare 8000 <HI>l.</HI> Hence perhaps &s;he had contracted a little Gloomine&s;s of Temper: For &s;he was rather a good Servant than a good Wife; nor had &s;he always the Gratitude to return the ex|traordinary Degree of roaring Mirth, with which the Squire received her, even with a good humoured Smile. She would, moreover, &s;ometimes interfere with Matters which did not concern her, as the vio|lent Drinking of her Hu&s;band, which in the gentle&s;t Terms &s;he would take &s;ome of the few Opportuni|ties he gave her of remon&s;trating again&s;t. And once in her Life &s;he very earne&s;tly entreated him to carry her for two Months to <HI>London,</HI> which he perempto|rily denied; nay, was angry with his Wife for the Reque&s;t ever after, being well a&s;&s;ured, that all the Hu&s;|bands in <HI>London</HI> are Cuckolds.</P>
<P>For this la&s;t, and many other good Rea&s;ons, <HI>We|&s;tern</HI> at length heartily hated his Wife; and this Ha|tred as he never concealed before her Death, &s;o he ne|ver forgot it afterwards; but when any Thing in the lea&s;t &s;oured him, as a bad &s;centing Day, or a Di&s;tem|per among his Hounds, or any other &s;uch Misfor|tune, he con&s;tantly vented his Spleen by Invectives again&s;t the Decea&s;ed; &s;aying,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'If my Wife was alive now, &s;he would be glad of this.'</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e Invectives he was e&s;pecially de&s;irous of throwing forth before <HI>Sophia:</HI> For as he loved her more than he did any other, &s;o he was really jea|lous that &s;he had loved her Mother better than him. And this Jealou&s;y <HI>Sophia</HI> &s;eldom failed of heightening
<PB N="18" REF="27">
on the&s;e Occa&s;ions: For he was not contented with violating her Ears with the Abu&s;e of her Mother; but endeavoured to force an explicit Approbation of all this Abu&s;e, with which De&s;ire he never could prevail upon her by any Promi&s;e or Threats to comply.</P>
<P>Hence &s;ome of my Readers will, perhaps, won|der that the Squire had not hated <HI>Sophia</HI> as much as he had hated her Mother; but I mu&s;t inform them, that Hatred is not the Effect of Love, even through the Medium of Jealou&s;y. It is, indeed, very po&s;|&s;ible for jealous Per&s;ons to kill the Objects of their Jealou&s;y, but not to hate them. Which Sentiment being a pretty hard Mor&s;el, and bearing &s;omething of the Air of a Paradox, we &s;hall leave the Reader to chew the Cud upon it to the End of the Chapter.</P>

Was not thy Mother a d&mdash;d B&mdash;to me? An&s;wer me that. What, I &s;uppo&s;e, you de&s;pi&s;e your Fa|ther too, and don't think him good enough to &s;peak to?'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'For Heavn's Sake, Sir,' an&s;wered <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'do not give &s;o cruel a Turn to my Silence. I am &s;ure I would &s;ooner die than be guilty of any Di&s;re&s;pect
<PB N="19" REF="28">
towards you; but how can I venture to &s;peak, when every Word mu&s;t either offend my dear Papa, or convict me of the blacke&s;t Ingratitude as well as Impiety to the Memory of the be&s;t of Mo|thers: For &s;uch, I am certain my Mamma was al|ways to me?'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'And your Aunt, I &s;uppo&s;e, is the be&s;t of Si&s;ters too!' replied the Squire. 'Will you be &s;o kind as to allow that &s;he is a B&mdash;? I may fairly in&s;i&s;t upon that, I think.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Sir,' &s;ays <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'I have great Obliga|tions to my Aunt. She hath been a &s;econd Mother to me.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'And a &s;econd Wife to me too,' returned <HI>We|&s;tern;</HI> '&s;o you will take her Part too! You won't confe&s;s that &s;he hath acted the Part of the vile&s;t Si&s;|ter in the World?'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Upon my Word, Sir,' cries <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'I mu&s;t belie my Heart wickedly if I did. I know my Aunt and you differ very much in your Ways of thinking; but I have heard her a thou&s;and Times expre&s;s the greate&s;t Affection for you; and I am convinced &s;o far from her being the wor&s;t Si&s;ter in the World, there are very few who love a Bro|ther better.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> of all which is,' an&s;wered the Squire, 'that I am in the wrong. Ay, certainly. Ay, to be &s;ure the Woman is in the Right, and the Man in the Wrong always.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Pardon me, Sir,' cries <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'I do not &s;ay &s;o.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'What don't you &s;ay,' an&s;wered the Father? 'you have the Impudence to &s;ay &s;he's in the Right; doth it not follow then of Cour&s;e that I'm in the wrong? And perhaps I am in the wrong to &s;uffer &s;uch a Pre&s;byterian <HI>Hanoverian</HI> B&mdash;to come into my Hou&s;e. She may 'dite me of a Plot for any Thing I know, and give my E&s;tate to the Go|vernment.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><PB N="20" REF="29">
'So far, Sir, from injuring you or your E&s;tate,' &s;ays <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'if my Aunt had died Ye&s;terday, I am convinced &s;he would have left you her whole Fortune.'</Q></P>
<P>Whether <HI>Sophia</HI> intended it or no, I &s;hall not pre|&s;ume to a&s;&s;ert; but certain it is, the&s;e la&s;t Words pe|netrated very deep into the Ears of her Father, and produced a much more &s;en&s;ible Effect than all &s;he had &s;aid before. He received the Sound with much the &s;ame Action as a Man receives a Bullet in his Head. He &s;tarted, &s;taggered and turned pale. After which he remained &s;ilent above a Minute, and then began in the following he&s;itating Manner. <Q REND="inline">'Ye&s;ter|day! &s;he would have left me her E&s;teate Ye&s;terday! would &s;he? Why Ye&s;terday of all the Days in the Year? I &s;uppo&s;e if &s;he dies To-morrow &s;he will leave it to &s;omebody el&s;e, and perhaps out of the Vamily:'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'My Aunt, Sir,' cries <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'hath very violent Pa&s;&s;ions, and I can't an&s;wer what &s;he may do under their Influence.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'You can't! returned the Father, 'and pray who hath been the Occa&s;ion of putting her into tho&s;e violent Pa&s;&s;ions? Nay, who hath actually put her into them? Was not you and &s;he hard at it before I came into the Room? Be&s;ides, was not all our Quarrel about you? I have not quarreled with Si&s;ter the&s;e many Years but upon your Ac|count; and now you would throw the whole Blame upon me, as thof I &s;hould be the Occa&s;ion of her leaving her E&s;teate out o' the Vamily. I could have expected no better indeed, this is like the Return you make to all the re&s;t of my Fondne&s;s.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'I be&s;eech you then,' cries <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'upon my Knees I be&s;eech you, if I have been the unhappy Occa&s;ion of this Difference, that you will endea|vour to make it up with my Aunt, and not &s;uffer her to leave your Hou&s;e in this violent Rage of Anger: She is a very good-natured Woman, and
<PB N="21" REF="30">
a few civil Words will &s;atisfy her&mdash;Let me in|treat you, Sir.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'So I mu&s;t go and a&s;k Pardon for your Fault, mu&s;t I?' an&s;wered <HI>We&s;tern.</HI> 'You have lo&s;t the Hare, and I mu&s;t draw every Way to find her again? In|deed if I was certain'</Q>&mdash;Here he &s;topt, and <HI>So|phia</HI> throwing in more Entreaties, at length prevailed upon him; and after venting two or three bitter &s;arca&s;tical Expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t his Daughter, he depart|ed as fa&s;t as he could to recover his Si&s;ter, before her Equipage could be gotten ready.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> then retired to her Chamber of Mourning, where &s;he indulged her&s;elf (if the Phra&s;e may be al|lowed me) in all the Luxury of tender Grief. She read over the Letter which &s;he had received from <HI>Jones</HI> more than once; her Muff too was u&s;ed on this Oc|ca&s;ion; and &s;he bathed both the&s;e, as well as her&s;elf, with her Tears. In this Situation, the friendly Mrs. <HI>Honour</HI> exerted her utmo&s;t Abilities to comfort her afflicted Mi&s;tre&s;s. She ran over the Names of many young Gentlemen; and having greatly commended their Parts and Per&s;ons, a&s;&s;ured <HI>Sophia</HI> that &s;he might take her choice of any. The&s;e Methods mu&s;t have certainly been u&s;ed with &s;ome Succe&s;s in Di&s;orders of the like Kind, or &s;o &s;kilful a Practitioner as Mrs. <HI>Ho|nour</HI> would never have ventured to apply them; nay, I have heard that the College of Chambermaids hold them to be as &s;overeign Remedies as any in the female Di&s;pen&s;ary; but whether it was that <HI>Sophia</HI>'s Di&s;ea&s;e differed inwardly, from tho&s;e Ca&s;es with which it a|greed in external Symptoms, I will not a&s;&s;ert; but, in Fact, the good Waiting-woman did more Harm than Good, and at la&s;t &s;o incen&s;ed her Mi&s;tre&s;s (which was no ea&s;y Matter) that with an angry Voice &s;he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her from her Pre&s;ence.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. <HI>Containing great Variety of Matter.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Squire overtook his Si&s;ter ju&s;t as &s;he was &s;tepping into the Coach, and partly by Force, and partly by Solicitations, prevailed upon her to or|der her Hor&s;es back into their Quarters. He &s;uc|ceeded in this Attempt without much Difficulty: For the Lady was, as we have already hinted, of a mo&s;t placable Di&s;po&s;ition, and greatly loved her Bro|ther, tho' &s;he de&s;pi&s;ed his Parts, or rather his little Knowledge of the World.</P>
<P>Poor <HI>Sophia,</HI> who had fir&s;t &s;et on Foot this Re|conciliation, was now made the Sacrifice to it. They both concurred in their Cen&s;ures on her Conduct; jointly declared War again&s;t her; and directly pro|ceeded to Council, how to carry it on in the mo&s;t vi|gorous Manner. For this Purpo&s;e, Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> propo&s;ed not only an immediate Conclu&s;ion of the Treaty with <HI>Allworthy;</HI> but as immediately to carry it into Execution; &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">'That there was no o|ther Way to &s;ucceed with her Niece but by violent Methods, which &s;he was convinced <HI>Sophia</HI> had not &s;ufficient Re&s;olution to re&s;i&s;t. 'By violent, &s;ays &s;he, 'I mean rather, ha&s;ty Mea&s;ures: For as to Con|finement or ab&s;olute Force, no &s;uch Things mu&s;t or can be attempted. Our Plan mu&s;t be concerted for a Surprize, and not for a Storm.'</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e Matters were re&s;olved on, when Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI> came to pay a Vi&s;it to his Mi&s;tre&s;s. The Squire no &s;ooner heard of his Arrival, than he &s;tept a&s;ide, by his Si&s;ter's Advice, to give his Daughter Orders for the proper Reception of her Lover; which he did with the mo&s;t bitter Execrations and Denunciations of of Judgment on her Refu&s;al.</P>
<P>The Impetuo&s;ity of the Squire bore down all be|fore him; and <HI>Sophia,</HI> as her Aunt very wi&s;ely fore|&s;aw,
<PB N="23" REF="32">
was not able to re&s;i&s;t him. She agreed, therefore, to &s;ee <HI>Blifil,</HI> tho' &s;he had &s;carce Spirits or Strength &s;ufficient to utter her A&s;&s;ent. Indeed to give a per|emtory Denial to a Father whom &s;he &s;o tenderly loved, was no ea&s;y Ta&s;k. Had this Circum&s;tance been out of the Ca&s;e, much le&s;s Re&s;olution than what &s;he was really Mi&s;tre&s;s of, would, perhaps, have &s;erved her; but it is no unu&s;ual Thing to a&s;cribe tho&s;e Actions entirely to Fear, which are in a great Mea|&s;ure produced by Love.</P>
<P>In Pur&s;uance, therefore, of her Father's peremp|tory Command, <HI>Sophia</HI> now admitted Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI>'s Vi&s;it. Scenes, like this, when painted at large, af|ford, as we have ob&s;erved, very little Entertainment to the Reader. Here, therefore, we &s;hall &s;trictly adhere to a Rule of <HI>Horace;</HI> by which Writers are directed to pa&s;s over all tho&s;e Matters, which they de&s;pair of placing in a &s;hining Light. A Rule, we conceive, of excellent U&s;e as well to the Hi&s;torian as to the Poet; and which, if followed, mu&s;t, at lea&s;t, have this good Effect, that many a great Evil (for &s;o all great Books are called) would thus be reduced to a &s;mall one.</P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible the great Art u&s;ed by <HI>Blifil</HI> at this In|terview, would have prevailed on <HI>Sophia</HI> to have made another Man in his Circum&s;tances her Confident, and to have revealed the whole Secret of her Heart to him; but &s;he had contracted &s;o ill an Opinion of this young Gentleman, that &s;he was re&s;olved to place no Confidence in him: For Simplicity, when &s;et on it's Guard, is often a Match for Cunning. Her Beha|viour to him, therefore, was entirely forced, and in|deed &s;uch as is generally pre&s;cribed to Virgins upon the &s;econd formal Vi&s;it from one who is appointed for their Hu&s;band.</P>
<P>But tho' <HI>Blifil</HI> declared him&s;elf perfectly &s;atisfied with his Reception to the Squire, yet that Gentleman, who in Company with his Si&s;ter had overheard all,
<PB N="24" REF="33">
was not &s;o well plea&s;ed. He re&s;olved, in Pur&s;uance of the Advice of the &s;age Lady, to pu&s;h Matters as forward as po&s;&s;ible; and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to his in|tended Son-in-Law in the hunting Phra&s;e, he cry'd after a loud Holla, <Q REND="inline">'Follow her, Boy, follow her; run in, run in, that's it, Honeys. Dead, dead, dead.&mdash;Never be ba&s;hful, nor &s;tand &s;hall I, &s;hall I?<HI>&mdash;Allworthy</HI> and I can fini&s;h all Matters be|tween us this Afternoon, and let us ha' the Wed|ding To-morrow.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Blifil</HI> having conveyed the utmo&s;t Satisfaction into his Countenance, an&s;wered; <Q REND="inline">'As there is nothing, Sir, in this World, which I &s;o eagerly de&s;ire as an Alliance with your Family, except my Union with the mo&s;t amiable and de&s;erving <HI>Sophia,</HI> you may ea&s;ily imagine how impatient I mu&s;t be to &s;ee my|&s;elf in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my two highe&s;t Wi&s;hes. If I have not therefore importuned you on this Head, you will impute it only to my Fear of offending the Lady, by endeavouring to hurry on &s;o ble&s;&s;ed an Event, fa&s;ter than a &s;trict Compliance with all the Rules of Decency and Decorum will permit. But if by your Intere&s;t, Sir, &s;he might be induced to di&s;pence with any Formalities.'&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Formalities! with a Pox!' an&s;wered the Squire, 'Pooh, all Stuff and Non&s;en&s;e. I tell thee, &s;he &s;hall ha' thee To-morrow; you will know the World better hereafter, when you come to my Age. Wo|men never gi' their Con&s;ent, Man, if they can help it, 'tis not the Fa&s;hion. If I had &s;taid for her Mo|mother's Con&s;ent, I might have been a Batchelor to this Day.&mdash;To her, to her, to her, that's it, you jolly Dog. I tell thee &s;hat ha' her To-morrow Morning.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Blifil</HI> &s;uffered him&s;elf to be overpowered by the forcible Rhetoric of the Squire; and it being agreed that <HI>We&s;tern</HI> &s;hould clo&s;e with <HI>Allworthy</HI> that very Afternoon, the Lover departed home, having fir&s;t
<PB N="25" REF="34">
earne&s;tly begged that no Violence might be offered to the Lady by this Ha&s;te, in the &s;ame Manner as a Popi&s;h Inqui&s;itor begs the Lay Power to do no Vio|lence to the Heretic, delivered over to it, and again&s;t whom the Church hath pa&s;&s;ed Sentence.</P>
<P>And to &s;ay the Truth, <HI>Blifil</HI> had pa&s;&s;ed Sentence again&s;t <HI>Sophia;</HI> for however plea&s;ed he had declared him&s;elf to <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> with his Reception, he was by no means &s;atisfied, unle&s;s it was that he was &s;atisfied of the Hatred and Scorn of his Mi&s;tre&s;s; and this had produced no le&s;s reciprocal Hatred and Scorn in him. It may, perhaps, be a&s;ked, Why then did he not put an immediate End to all further Court&s;hip? I an&s;wer, for that very Rea&s;on, as well as for &s;everal others equally good, which we &s;hall now proceed to open to the Reader.</P>
<P>Tho' Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI> was not of the Complexion of <HI>Jones,</HI> nor ready to eat every Woman he &s;aw, yet he was far from being de&s;titute of that Appetite which is &s;aid to be the common Property of Animals. With this, he had the di&s;tingui&s;hing Ta&s;te, which &s;erves to direct Men in their Choice of the Objects, or Food of their &s;everal Appetites; and this taught him to con&s;ider <HI>Sophia</HI> as a mo&s;t delicious Mor&s;el, indeed to regard her with the &s;ame De&s;ires which an Ortolan in|&s;pires into the Soul on Epicure. Now the Agonies which affected the Mind of <HI>Sophia</HI> rather augment|ed than impaired her Beauty; for her Tears added Brightne&s;s to her Eyes, and her Brea&s;ts ro&s;e higher with her Sighs. Indeed no one hath &s;een Beauty in its highe&s;t Lu&s;tre, who hath never &s;een it in Di&s;tre&s;s. <HI>Blifil</HI> therefore looked on this human Ortolan with greater De&s;ire than when he had viewed her la&s;t; nor was his De&s;ire at all le&s;&s;ened by the Aver&s;ion which he di&s;covered in her to him&s;elf. On the contrary, this &s;erved rather to heighten the Plea&s;ure he propo&s;ed in rifling her Charms, as it added Triumph to Lu&s;t; nay, he had &s;ome further Views, from obtaining the ab&s;olute Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her Per&s;on, which we dete&s;t too
<PB N="26" REF="35">
much even to mention; and Revenge it&s;elf was not without its Share in the Gratifications which he pro|mi&s;ed him&s;elf. the rivalling poor <HI>Jones,</HI> and &s;upplant|ing him in her Affections, added another Spur to his Pur&s;uit, and promi&s;ed another additional Rapture to his Enjoyment.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all the&s;e Views, which to &s;ome &s;crupulous Per&s;ons may &s;eem to &s;avour too much of Malevolence, he had one Pro&s;pect, which few Readers will regard with any great Abhorrence. And this was the E&s;tate of Mr. <HI>We&s;tern;</HI> which was all to be &s;ettled on his Daughter and her I&s;&s;ue; for &s;o extravagant was the Affection of that fond Parent, that provided his Child would but con&s;ent to be mi&s;erable with the Hu&s;band he cho&s;e, he cared not at what Price he purcha&s;ed him.</P>
<P>For the&s;e Rea&s;ons Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI> was &s;o de&s;irous of the Match, that he intended to deceive <HI>Sophia,</HI> by pre|tending Love to her; and to deceive her Father and his own Uncle, by pretending he was beloved by her. In doing this, he availed him&s;elf of the Piety of <HI>Thwackum,</HI> who held, that if the End propo&s;ed was religious (as &s;urely Matrimony is) it mattered not how wicked were the Means. As, to other Occa&s;ions he u&s;ed to apply the Philo&s;ophy of <HI>Square,</HI> which taught, that the End was immaterial, &s;o that the Means were fair and con&s;i&s;tent with moral Rectitude. To &s;ay Truth, there were few Occurrences in Life on which he could not draw Advantantage from the Precepts of one or other of tho&s;e great Ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>Little Deceit was indeed nece&s;&s;ary to be practi&s;ed on Mr. <HI>We&s;tern;</HI> who thought the Inclinations of his Daughter of as little Con&s;equence, as <HI>Blifil</HI> him&s;elf conceived them to be; but as the Sentiments of Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> were of a very different Kind, &s;o it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to impo&s;e on him. In this, how|ever, <HI>Blifil</HI> was &s;o well a&s;&s;i&s;ted by <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> that he &s;ucceeded without Difficulty: For as Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> had been a&s;&s;ured by her Father that <HI>Sophia</HI> had a
<PB N="27" REF="36">
proper Affection for <HI>Blifil,</HI> and that all which he had &s;u&s;|pected concerning <HI>Jones,</HI> was entirely fal&s;e, <HI>Blifil</HI> had nothing more to do, than to confirm the&s;e A&s;&s;ertions; which he did with &s;uch Equivocations, that he pre|&s;erved a Salvo for his Con&s;cience; and had the Sa|tisfaction of conveying a Lie to his Uncle, without the Guilt of telling one. When he was examined touching the Inclinations of <HI>Sophia,</HI> by <HI>Allworthy,</HI> who &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'he would, on no Account, be acce&s;&s;ary to the forcing a young Lady into a Marriage con|trary to her own Will,'</Q> he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">'That the real Sentiments of young Ladies were very difficult to be under&s;tood; that her Behaviour to him was full as forward as he wi&s;hed it, and that if he could believe her Father, &s;he had all the Affection for him which any Lover could de&s;ire. As for <HI>Jones,'</HI> &s;aid he, 'whom I am loth to call Villain, tho' his Behaviour to you, Sir, &s;ufficiently ju&s;tifies the Appel|lation, his own Vanity, or perhaps &s;ome wicked Views, might make him boa&s;t of a Fal&s;hood; for if there had been any Reality in Mi&s;s <HI>We&s;tern</HI>'s Love to him, the Greatne&s;s of her Fortune would never have &s;uffered him to de&s;ert her, as you are well in|formed he hath. La&s;tly, Sir, I promi&s;e you I would not my&s;elf, for any Con&s;ideration, no not for the whole World, con&s;ent to marry this young Lady, if I was not per&s;uaded &s;he had all the Pa&s;&s;i|on for me which I de&s;ire &s;he &s;hould have.</Q></P>
<P>This excellent Method of conveying a Fal&s;hood with the Heart only, without making the Tongue guilty of an Untruth, by the Means of Equivocation and Impo&s;ture, hath quieted the Con&s;cience of many a notable Deceiver; and yet when we con&s;ider that it is Omni&s;cience on which the&s;e endeavour to im|po&s;e, it may po&s;&s;ibly &s;eem capable only of affording a very &s;uperficial Comfort; and that this artful and refined Di&s;tinction between communicating a Lie,
<PB N="28" REF="37">
and telling one, is hardly worth the Pains it co&s;ts them.</P>
<P><HI>Allworthy</HI> was pretty well &s;atisfied with what Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> and Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI> told him; and the Treaty was now at the End of two Days, concluded. Nothing then remained previous to the Office of the Prie&s;t, but the Office of the Lawyers, which threatened to take up &s;o much Time, that <HI>We&s;tern</HI> offered to bind him&s;elf by all Manner of Covenants, rather than to defer the Hap|pine&s;s of the young Couple. Indeed he was &s;o very ear|ne&s;t and pre&s;&s;ing, that an indifferent Per&s;on might have concluded he was more a Principal in this Match than he really was: But this Eagerne&s;s was natural to him on all Occa&s;ions; and he conducted every Scheme he un|dertook in &s;uch a Manner, as if the Succe&s;s of that alone was &s;ufficient to con&s;titute the whole Happine&s;s of his Life.</P>
<P>The joint Importunities of both Father and Son-in-law would probably have prevailed on Mr. <HI>All|worthy,</HI> who brooked but ill any Delay of giving Happine&s;s to others, had not <HI>Sophia</HI> her&s;elf prevented it, and taken Mea&s;ures to put a final End to the whole Treaty, and to rob both Church and Law of tho&s;e Taxes which the&s;e wi&s;e Bodies have thought proper to receive from the Propagation of the human Spe|cies, in a lawful Manner. Of which in the next Chapter.</P>

<P>THO' Mrs. <HI>Honour</HI> was principally attached to her Intere&s;t, &s;he was not without &s;ome little Attachment to <HI>Sophia.</HI> To &s;ay Truth, it was very difficult for any one to know that young Lady with|out loving her. She no &s;ooner, therefore, heard a

Piece of News, which &s;he imagined to be of great Importance to her Mi&s;tre&s;s, than quite forgetting the Anger which &s;he had conceived two Days before, at her unplea&s;ant Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from <HI>Sophia</HI>'s Pre&s;ence, &s;he ran ha&s;tily to inform her of this News.</P>
<P>The Beginning of her Di&s;cour&s;e was as abrupt as her Entrance into the Room. <Q REND="inline">'O dear Ma'am,' &s;ays &s;he, 'what doth your La'&s;hip think?

Here a very &s;tubborn Difficulty occurred, and this was the Removal of their Effects, which was much more ea|&s;ily got over by the Mi&s;tre&s;s than by the Maid: For when a Lady hath once taken a Re&s;olution to run to a Lover, or to run from him, all Ob&s;tacles are con&s;i|dered as Trifles. But <HI>Honour</HI> was in&s;pired by no &s;uch Motive: &s;he had no Raptures to expect, nor any Ter|rors to &s;hun, and be&s;ides the real Value of her Clothes, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> which con&s;i&s;ted great Part of her Fortune, &s;he had a capricious Fondne&s;s for &s;everal Gowns, and other Things; either becau&s;e they became her, or becau&s;e they were given her by &s;uch a particular Per&s;on; be|cau&s;e &s;he had brought them lately, or becau&s;e &s;he had had them long; or for &s;ome other Rea&s;ons equally good; &s;o that &s;he could not endure the Thought of leaving the poor Things behind her expo&s;ed to the Mercy of <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> who, &s;he doubted not, would make them &s;uffer Martyrdom in his Rage.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. <HI>Containing Scenes of Altercation, of no very uncommon Kind.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MRS. <HI>Honour</HI> had &s;carce &s;ooner parted from her young Lady, than &s;omething (for I would not, like the old Woman in <HI>Quivedo,</HI> injure the Devil by any fal&s;e Accu&s;ation, and po&s;&s;ibly he might have no Hand in it) but &s;omething, I &s;ay, &s;ugge&s;ted to her, that by &s;acrificing <HI>Sophia</HI> and all her Secrets to Mr. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> &s;he might probably make her Fortune. Ma|ny Con&s;iderations urged this Di&s;covery. The fair Pro&s;pect of a hand&s;ome Reward for &s;o great and ac|ceptable a Service to the Squire, tempted her Avarice; and again, the Danger of the Enterprize &s;he had un|dertaken; the Incertainty of its Succe&s;s; Night, Cold, Robbers, Ravi&s;hers, all alarmed her Fears. So for|cibly did all the&s;e operate upon her, that &s;he was al|mo&s;t determined to go directly to the Squire, and to lay open the whole Affair. She was, however, too upright a Judge to decree on one Side before &s;he had heard the other. And here, fir&s;t, a Journey to <HI>Lon|don</HI> appeared very &s;trongly in Support of <HI>Sophia.</HI> She
<PB N="35" REF="44">
eagerly longed to &s;ee a Place in which &s;he fancied Charms &s;hort only of tho&s;e which a raptured Saint imagines in Heaven. In the next Place, as &s;he knew <HI>Sophia</HI> to have much more Genero&s;ity than her Ma&s;|ter, &s;o her Fidelity promi&s;ed her a greater Reward than &s;he could gain by Treachery. She then cro&s;s|examined all the Articles which had rai&s;ed her Fears on the other Side, and found, on fairly &s;ifting the Matter, that there was very little in them. And now both Scales being reduced to a pretty even Ballance, her Love to her Mi&s;tre&s;s being thrown into the Scale of her Integrity, made that rather preponderate, when a Circum&s;tance &s;truck upon her Imagination, which might have had a dangerous Effect, had its whole Weight been fairly put into the other Scale. This was the Length of Time which mu&s;t intervene before <HI>Sophia</HI> would be able to fulfil her Promi&s;e; for tho' &s;he was intitled to her Mother's Fortune, at the Death of her Father, and to the Sum of <HI>3000l.</HI> left her by an Uncle when &s;he came of Age; yet the&s;e were di&s;tant Days, and many Accidents might prevent the intended Genero&s;ity of the young Lady, whereas the Rewards &s;he might expect from Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> were im|mediate. But while &s;he was pur&s;uing this Thought, the good Genius of <HI>Sophia,</HI> or that which pre&s;ided over the Integrity of Mrs. <HI>Honour,</HI> or perhaps mere Chance, &s;ent an Accident in her Way, which at once pre&s;erved her Fidelity, and even facilitated their intended Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI>'s Maid claimed great Superiority over Mrs. <HI>Honour,</HI> on &s;everal Accounts. Fir&s;t, her Birth was higher: For her great Grand-mother by the Mo|ther's Side was a Cou&s;in, not far removed, to an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Peer. Secondly, her Wages were greater. And la&s;t|ly, &s;he had been at <HI>London,</HI> and had of Con&s;equence &s;een more of the World. She had always behaved, therefore, to Mrs. <HI>Honour</HI> with that Re&s;erve, and had always exacted of her tho&s;e Marks of Di&s;tinction, which every Order of Females pre&s;erve and require in
<PB N="36" REF="45">
Conver&s;ation with tho&s;e of an inferior Order. Now as <HI>Honour</HI> did not at all Times agree with this Doc|trine; but would frequently break in upon the Re&s;pect which the other demanded, Mrs <HI>We&s;tern</HI>'s Maid was not at all plea&s;ed with her Company: Indeed, &s;he ear|ne&s;tly longed to return home to the Hou&s;e of her Mi&s;|tre&s;s, where &s;he domineered at Will over all the o|ther Servants. She had been greatly, therefore, di&s;|appointed in the Morning when Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> had changed her Mind on the very Point of Departure, and had been in what is vulgarly called, a glouting Humour ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>In this Humour, which was none of the &s;weete&s;t, &s;he came into the Room where <HI>Honour</HI> was debating with her&s;elf, in the Manner we have above related. <HI>Honour</HI> no &s;ooner &s;aw her, than &s;he addre&s;&s;ed her in the following obliging Phra&s;e. <Q REND="inline">'Soh!

The other Lady put on one of her mo&s;t malicious Sneers, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'Creature! you are below my Anger; and it is beneath me to give ill Words to &s;uch an audacious &s;aucy Trollop; but, Hu&s;&s;y, I mu&s;t tell you, your Breeding &s;hews the Mean|ne&s;s of your Birth as well as of your Education; and both very properly qualify you to be the mean &s;erving Woman of a Country Girl.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Don't a|bu&s;e my Lady,' cries <HI>Honour,</HI> 'I won't take that of you; &s;he's as much better than yours as &s;he is younger, and ten thou&s;and Times more hand&s;omer.</Q></P>

<P>LOgicians &s;ometimes prove too much by an Ar|gument, and Politicians often overreach them|&s;elves in a Scheme. Thus had it like to have hap|pened to Mrs. <HI>Honour,</HI> who in&s;tead of recovering the re&s;t of her Clothes, had like to have &s;topped even tho&s;e &s;he had on her Back from e&s;caping: For the Squire no &s;ooner heard of her having abu&s;ed his Si&s;ter, than he &s;wore twenty Oaths he would &s;end her to <HI>Bridewell.</HI></P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> was a very good-natured Woman, and ordinarily of a forgiving Temper. She had lately remitted the Tre&s;pa&s;s of a Stage-coach Man, who had overturned her Po&s;t-chai&s;e into a Ditch; nay, &s;he had even broken the Law in refu&s;ing to pro&s;ecute a High-way-man who had robbed her, not only of a Sum of Money, but of her Ear-rings; at the &s;ame Time d&mdash;ning her, and &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">'&s;uch hand&s;ome B&mdash;s as you, don't want Jewels to &s;et them off, and be d&mdash;nd to you.</Q> But now, &s;o uncertain are our Tempers, and &s;o much do we at different Times differ from our&s;elves, &s;he would hear of no Mitigati|on; nor could all the affected Penitence of <HI>Honour,</HI> nor all the Entreaties of <HI>Sophia</HI> for her own Servant, prevail with her to de&s;i&s;t from earne&s;tly de&s;iring her Brother to execute Ju&s;tice&s;hip (for it was indeed a Syllable more than Ju&s;tice) on the Wench.</P>
<P>But luckily the Clerk had a Qualification, which no Clerk to a Ju&s;tice of Peace ought ever to be with|out, namely, &s;ome Under&s;tanding in the Law of this
<PB N="40" REF="49">
Realm. He therefore whi&s;pered in the Ear of the Ju&s;tice, that he would exceed his Authority by com|mitting the Girl to <HI>Bridewell,</HI> as there had been no Attempt to break the Peace; <Q REND="inline">'for I am afraid, Sir,' &s;ays he, 'you cannot legally commit any one to <HI>Bridewell</HI> only for Ill-breeding.'</Q></P>
<P>In the Matters of high Importance, particularly in Ca&s;es relating to the Game, the Ju&s;tice was not al|ways attentive to the&s;e Admonitions of his Clerk: For, indeed, in executing the Laws under that Head, many Ju&s;tices of Peace &s;uppo&s;e they have a large di&s;|cretionary Power. By Virtue of which, under the Notion of &s;earching for, and taking away Engines for the De&s;truction of the Game, they often com|mit Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, and &s;ometimes Felony at their Plea|&s;ure.</P>
<P>But this Offence was not of quite &s;o high a Na|ture, nor &s;o dangerous to the Society. Here, there|fore, the Ju&s;tice behaved with &s;ome Attention to the Advice of his Clerk: For, in Fact, he had already had two Informations exhibited again&s;t him in the King's Bench, and had no Curio&s;ity to try a third.</P>
<P>The Squire, therefore, putting on a mo&s;t wi&s;e and &s;ignificant Countenance, after a Preface of &s;everal Hum's and Ha's, told his Si&s;ter, that upon more ma|ture Deliberation, he was of Opinion that <Q REND="inline">as there was no breaking up of the Peace,  &s;uch as the Law, &s;ays he, 'calls breaking open a Door, or breaking a Hedge, or breaking a Head; or any &s;uch Sort of Breaking; the Matter did not amount to a feloni|ous Kind of a Thing, nor Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es nor Damages, and, therefore, there was no Puni&s;hment in the Law for it.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'&s;he knew the Law much bet|ter; that &s;he had known Servants very &s;everely puni&s;hed for affronting their Ma&s;ters; and then named a certain Ju&s;tice of the Peace in <HI>London,</HI> who,' &s;he &s;aid, 'would commit a Servant to <HI>Bride|well,</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="50">
at any Time when a Ma&s;ter or Mi&s;tre&s;s de|&s;ired it.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Like enough, cries the Squire, 'it may be &s;o in <HI>London;</HI> but the Law is different in the Country.&mdash;'</Q> Here followed a very learned Di&s;pute between the Brother and Si&s;ter concerning the Law, which we would in&s;ert, if we imagined many of our Readers could under&s;tand it. This was, however, at length referred by both Parties to the Clerk, who decided it in Favour of the Magi&s;trate; and Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> was, in the End, obliged to content her&s;elf with the Satisfaction of having <HI>Honour</HI> turned away; to which <HI>Sophia</HI> her&s;elf very readily and chearfully con&s;ented.</P>
<P>Thus Fortune, after having diverted her&s;elf, ac|cording to Cu&s;tom, with two or three Frolicks, at la&s;t di&s;po&s;ed all Matters to the Advantage of our He|roine; who, indeed, &s;ucceeded admirably well in her Deceit, con&s;idering it was the fir&s;t &s;he ever had prac|ti&s;ed. And, to &s;ay the Truth, I have often conclud|ed, that the hone&s;t Part of Mankind would be much too hard for the knavi&s;h, if they could bring them|&s;elves to incur the Guilt, or thought it worth their while to take the Trouble.</P>
<P><HI>Honour</HI> acted her Part to the utmo&s;t Perfection. She no &s;ooner &s;aw her&s;elf &s;ecure from all Danger of <HI>Bridewell,</HI> a Word which had rai&s;ed mo&s;t horrible Ideas in her Mind, than &s;he re&s;umed tho&s;e Airs which her Terrours before had a little abated; and laid down her Place, with as much Affectation of Con|tent, and indeed of Contempt, as was ever practi&s;ed at the Re&s;ignation of Places of a much greater Im|portance. If the Reader plea&s;es, therefore, we chu&s;e rather to &s;ay &s;he re&s;igned&mdash;which hath, indeed, been always held a &s;ynonymous Expre&s;&s;ion with be|ing turned out, or turned away.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> ordered her to be very expeditious in packing: For his Si&s;ter declared &s;he would not &s;leep another Night under the &s;ame Roof with &s;o impu|dent
<PB N="42" REF="51">
a Slut. To work therefore &s;he went, and that &s;o earne&s;tly, that every Thing was ready early in the Evening; when having received her Wages, away packed Bag and Baggage, to the great Satisfaction of every one, but of none more than of <HI>Sophia;</HI> who, having appointed her Maid to meet her at a certain Place not far from the Hou&s;e, exactly at the dread|ful and gho&s;tly Hour of Twelve, began to prepare for her own Departure.</P>
<P>But fir&s;t &s;he was obliged to give two painful Au|diences, the one to her Aunt, and the other to her Father. In the&s;e Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> her&s;elf began to talk to her in a more peremptory Stile than before; but her Father treated her in &s;o violent and outragious a Manner, that he frightened her into an affected Com|pliance with his Will, which &s;o highly plea&s;ed the good Squire, that he changed his Frowns into Smiles, and his Menaces into promi&s;es; he vowed his whole Soul was wrapt in hers, that her Con&s;ent (for &s;o he con&s;trued the Words, <HI>You know, Sir, I mu&s;t not, nor can refu&s;e to obey any ab&s;olute Command of yours,)</HI> had made him the happie&s;t of Mankind. He then gave her a large Bank-Bill to di&s;po&s;e of in any Trinkets &s;he plea&s;ed, and ki&s;&s;ed and embraced her in the fond|e&s;t Manner, while Tears of Joy trickled from tho&s;e Eyes, which a few Moments before had darted Fire and Rage again&s;t the dear Object of all his Affec|tion.</P>
<P>In&s;tances of this Behaviour in Parents are &s;o com|mon, that the Reader, I doubt not, will be very lit|tle a&s;toni&s;hed at the whole Conduct of Mr. <HI>We&s;tern.</HI> If he &s;hould, I own I am not able to account for it; &s;ince that he loved his Daughter mo&s;t tenderly, is, I think, beyond Di&s;pute. So indeed have many o|thers, who have rendered their Children mo&s;t com|pleatly mi&s;erable by the &s;ame Conduct; which, tho' it is almo&s;t univer&s;al in Parents, hath always appear|ed to me to be the mo&s;t unaccountable of all the Ab|&s;urdities,
<PB N="43" REF="52">
which ever entered into the Brain <HI>of that &s;trange perfidious Creature Man.</HI></P>
<P>The latter Part of Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI>'s Behaviour had &s;o &s;trong an Effect on the tender Heart of <HI>Sophia,</HI> that it &s;ugge&s;ted a Thought to her, which not all the po|litic Sophi&s;try of her Aunt, nor all the Menaces of her Father had ever once brought into her Head. She reverenced her Father &s;o piou&s;ly, and loved him &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately, that &s;he had &s;carce ever felt more plea|&s;ing Sen&s;ations, than what aro&s;e from the Share &s;he frequently had of contributing to his Amu&s;ement; and &s;ometimes, perhaps, to higher Gratifications; for he never could contain the Delight of hearing her commended, which he had the Satisfaction of hearing almo&s;t every Day of her Life. The Idea, therefore, of the immen&s;e Happine&s;s &s;he &s;hould con|vey to her Father by her Con&s;ent to this Match, made a &s;trong Impre&s;&s;ion on her Mind. Again, the ex|treme Piety of &s;uch an Act of Obedience, worked very forcibly, as &s;he had a very deep Sen&s;e of Re|ligion. La&s;tly, when &s;he reflected how much &s;he her|&s;elf was to &s;uffer, being indeed to become little le&s;s than a Sacrifice, or a Martyr, to filial Love and Duty, &s;he felt an agreeable Tickling in a certain little Pa&s;|&s;ion, which tho' it bears no immediate Affinity either to Religion or Virtue, is often &s;o kind as to lend great A&s;&s;i&s;tance in executing the Purpo&s;es of both.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> was charmed with the Contemplation of &s;o heroic an Action, and began to compliment her&s;elf with much permature Flattery, when <HI>Cupid,</HI> who lay hid in her Muff, &s;uddenly crept out, and, like <HI>Punchi|nello</HI> in a Puppet-&s;hew, kicked all out before him. In Truth (for we &s;corn to deceive our Reader, or to vindicate the Character of our Heroine, by a&s;crib|ing her Actions to &s;upernatural Impul&s;e) the Thoughts of her beloved <HI>Jones,</HI> and &s;ome Hopes (however di&s;|tant) in which he was very particularly concerned,
<PB N="44" REF="53">
immediately de&s;troyed all which filial Love, Piety and Pride had, with their joint Endeavours, been la|bouring to bring about.</P>
<P>But before we proceed any farther with <HI>Sophia,</HI> we mu&s;t now look back to Mr. <HI>Jones.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. <HI>Containing &s;everal Matters natural enough perhaps, but</HI> Low.</HEAD>
<P>THE Reader will be plea&s;ed to remember, that we left Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> in the Beginning of this Book, on his Road to <HI>Bri&s;tol;</HI> being determined to &s;eek his Fortune at Sea, or rather, indeed, to fly away from his Fortune on Shore.</P>
<P>It happened, (a Thing not very unu&s;ual) that the Guide who undertook to conduct him on his Way, was unluckily unacquainted with the Road; &s;o that having mi&s;&s;ed his right Track, and being a&s;hamed to a&s;k Information, he rambled about backwards and forwards, till Night came on, and it began to grow dark. <HI>Jones</HI> &s;u&s;pecting what had happened, acquaint|ed the Guide with his Apprehen&s;ions; but he in&s;i&s;ted on it, that they were in the right Road, and add|ed, it would be very &s;trange if he &s;hould not know the Road to <HI>Bri&s;tol;</HI> tho', in Reality, it would have been much &s;tranger if he had known it, having never pa&s;t through it in his Life before.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> had not &s;uch implicit Faith in his Guide; but that on their arrival at a Village, he enquired of the fir&s;t Fellow he &s;aw, whether they were in the Road to <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI> <Q REND="inline">'Whence did you come?'</Q> cries the Fel|low. <Q REND="inline">'no Matter,' &s;ays <HI>Jones,</HI> a little ha&s;tily, 'I want to know if this be the Road to <HI>Bri&s;tol.'</HI></Q> <Q REND="inline">'The Road to <HI>Bri&s;tol!'</HI> cries the Fellow, &s;cratching his Head, 'Why, Ma&s;ter, I believe you will hardly get to <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> this Way to Night.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">Prithee, Friend,
<PB N="45" REF="54">
then,' an&s;wered <HI>Jones,</HI> 'do tell us which is the Way.</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'Why, Mea&s;ter,' cries the Fellow, 'you mu&s;t have come out of your Road the Lord knows whither: For thick Way goeth to <HI>Glouce&s;ter.'</HI></Q> <Q REND="inline">'Well, and which Way goes to <HI>Bri&s;tol',</HI></Q> &s;aid <HI>Jones,</HI> <Q REND="inline">Why, you be going away from <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI>'</Q> an&s;wered the Fellow.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'Then,' &s;aid <HI>Jones,</HI> 'we mu&s;t go back again.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Ay, you mu&s;t,' </Q> &s;aid the Fellow. <Q REND="inline">'Well, and when we come back to the Top of the Hill, which Way mu&s;t we take?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Why you mu&s;t keep the &s;trait Road.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">But I remember there are two Roads, one to the Right and the other to the Left.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">Why you mu&s;t keep the right-hand Road, and then gu &s;trait vorwards; only remember to turn fir&s;t to your Right, and then to your Left again, and then to your Right; and that brings you to the Squire's, and then you mu&s;t keep &s;trait vorwards, and turn to the Left.'</Q></P>
<P>Another Fellow now came up, and a&s;ked which Way the Gentlemen were going?&mdash;of which be|ing informed by <HI>Jones,</HI> he fir&s;t &s;cratched his Head, and then leaning upon a Pole he had in his Hand, be|gan to tell him, <Q REND="inline">That he mu&s;t keep the Right-hand Road for about a Mile or a Mile and half or zuch a Matter, and then he mu&s;t turn &s;hort to the Left, which would bring him round by Mea&s;ter <HI>Jin Bear|nes</HI>'s.' But which is Mr. <HI>John Bearnes</HI>'s,' &s;ays <HI>Jones.</HI> 'O Lord,' cries the Fellow, 'why don't you know Mea&s;ter <HI>Jin Bearnes?</HI> Whence then did you come?</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e two Fellows had almo&s;t conquered the Pa|tience of <HI>Jones,</HI> when a plain well-looking Man (who was indeed a Quaker) acco&s;ted him thus: <Q REND="inline">Friend, I perceive thou ha&s;t lo&s;t thy Way, and if thou wilt take my Advice thou wilt not attempt to find it to Night. It is almo&s;t dark, and the Road is difficult to hit; be&s;ides there have been &s;everal Robberies committed lately between this and <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI> Here is
<PB N="46" REF="55">
a very creditable good Hou&s;e ju&s;t by, where thou may'&s;t find good Entertainment for thy&s;elf and thy Cattle till Morning.'</Q> <HI>Jones,</HI> after a little Per&s;ua|&s;ion, agreed to &s;tay in this Place till the Morning, and was conducted by his Friend to the Public-Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The Landlord, who was a very civil Fellow, told <HI>Jones,</HI> <Q REND="inline">'he hoped he would excu&s;e the Badne&s;s of his Accommodation: For that his wife was gone from home, and had locked up almo&s;t every Thing, and carried the Keys along with her.'</Q> Indeed, the Fact was, that a favourite Daughter of hers was ju&s;t mar|ried, and gone, that Morning, home with her Hu&s;|band; and that &s;he and her Mother together had al|mo&s;t &s;tript the poor Man of all his Goods, as well as Money: For tho' he had &s;everal Children, this Daughter only, who was the Mother's Favourite, was the Object of her Con&s;ideration; and to the Humour, of this one Child, &s;he would, with Plea|&s;ure, have &s;acrificed all the re&s;t, and her Hu&s;band in|to the Bargain.</P>
<P>Tho' <HI>Jones</HI> was very unfit for any Kind of Com|pany, and would have preferred being alone, yet he could not re&s;i&s;t the Importunities of the hone&s;t Qua|ker; who was the more de&s;irous of &s;itting with him, from having remarked the Melancholy which ap|peared both in his Countenance and Behaviour; and which the poor Quaker thought his Conver&s;ation might in &s;ome Mea&s;ure relieve.</P>
<P>After they had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome Time together, in &s;uch a Manner that my hone&s;t Friend might have thought him&s;elf at one of his Silent-Meetings, the Quaker began to be moved by &s;ome Spirit or other, probably that of Curio&s;ity; and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'Friend, I perceive &s;ome &s;ad Di&s;a&s;ter hath befallen thee; but, pray be of Comfort. Perhaps thou ha&s;t lo&s;t a Friend. If &s;o, thou mu&s;t con&s;ider we are all mortal. And why &s;hould'&s;t thou grieve, when thou knowe&s;t thy
<PB N="47" REF="56">
Grief will do thy Friend no Good. We are all born to Affliction. I my&s;elf have my Sorrows as well as thee, and mo&s;t probably greater Sorrows. Tho' I have a clear E&s;tate of a <HI>100l.</HI> a Year, which is as much as I want, and I have a Con&s;ci|ence, I thank the Lord, void of Offence. My Con&s;titution is &s;ound and &s;trong, and there is no Man can demand a Debt of me nor accu&s;e me of an Injury&mdash;yet, Friend, I &s;hould be concerned to think thee as mi&s;erable as my&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>Here the Quaker ended with a deep Sigh; and <HI>Jones</HI> pre&s;ently an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">'I am very &s;orry, Sir, for your Unhappine&s;s, whatever is the Occa&s;ion of it.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">Ah! Friend,' replyed the Quaker, 'one only Daughter is the Occa&s;ion. One who was my greate&s;t Delight upon Earth, and who within this Week is run away from me, and is married again&s;t my Con&s;ent. I had provided her a proper Match, a &s;ober Man, and one of Sub&s;tance; but &s;he, for&s;ooth, would chu&s;e for her&s;elf, and away &s;he is gone with a young Fellow not worth a Groat. If &s;he had been dead, as I &s;uppo&s;e thy Friend is, I &s;hould have been happy!'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'That is very &s;trange, Sir,'</Q> &s;aid <HI>Jones.</HI> <Q REND="inline">'Why would it not be better for her to be dead, than to be a Beg|gar?' replied the Quaker: 'For, as I told you, the Fellow is not worth a Groat; and &s;urely &s;he cannot expect that I &s;hall ever give her a Shilling. No, as &s;he hath married for Love, let her live on Love if &s;he can; let her carry her Love to Market, and &s;ee whether any one will change it into Silver, or even into Halfpence.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'You know your own Concerns be&s;t, Sir,'</Q> &s;aid <HI>Jones.</HI> <Q REND="inline">'It mu&s;t have been,' continued the Quaker, 'a long premedi|tated Scheme to cheat me: For they have known one another from their infancy; and I always preached to her again&s;t Love&mdash;and told her a thou&s;and Times over, it was all Folly and Wickedne&s;s. Nay, the cunning Slut pretended to hearken to me, and
<PB N="48" REF="57">
to de&s;pi&s;e all Wantonne&s;s of the Fle&s;h; and yet at la&s;t, to break out of a Window up two pair of Stairs: For I began, indeed, a little to &s;u&s;pect her, and had locked her up carefully, intending the very next Morning to have married her up to my Liking. But &s;he di&s;appointed me within a few Hours, and e&s;caped away to the Lover of her own chu&s;ing, who lo&s;t no Time: For they were mar|ried and bedded, and all within an Hour.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">But it &s;hall be the wor&s;t Hour's Work for them both that ever they did, for they may &s;tarve, or beg, or &s;teal together for me. I will never give either of them a Farthing.</Q> Here <HI>Jones</HI> &s;tarting up, cry'd, <Q REND="inline">I really mu&s;t be excu&s;ed, I wi&s;h you would leave me.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Come, come, Friend, &s;aid the Quaker, don't give Way to Concern. You &s;ee there are other People mi&s;erable, be&s;ides your|&s;elf.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I &s;ee there are Madmen and Fools and Villains in the World,' cries <HI>Jones</HI>&mdash;'But let me give you a Piece of Advice; &s;end for your Daughter and Son-in-law home, and don't be your&s;elf the only Cau&s;e of Mi&s;ery to one you pre|tend to love.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">Send for her and her Hu&s;band home!' cries the Quaker loudly, 'I would &s;ooner &s;end for the two greate&s;t Enemies I have in the World!'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Well go home your&s;elf, or where you plea&s;e,' &s;aid <HI>Jones:</HI> 'For I will &s;it no longer in &s;uch Company.</Q> <Q REND="inline">'&mdash;Nay, Friend,' an&s;wered the Quaker, I &s;corn to impo&s;e my Company on any one.'</Q> He then offered to pull Money from his Pocket, but <HI>Jones</HI> pu&s;hed him with &s;ome Violence out of the Room.</P>
<P>The Subject of the Quaker's Di&s;cour&s;e had &s;o deeply affected <HI>Jones,</HI> that he &s;tared very wildly all the Time he was &s;peaking. This the Quaker had ob&s;erved, and this, added to the re&s;t of his Behavi|our, in&s;pired hone&s;t <HI>Broadbrim</HI> with a Conceit, that his Companion was in reality out of his Sen&s;es. In|&s;tead of re&s;enting the Affront, therefore, the Quaker
<PB N="49" REF="58">
was moved with Compa&s;&s;ion for his unhappy Cir|cum&s;tances; and having communicated his Opinion to the Landlord, he de&s;ired him to take great Care of his Gue&s;t, and to treat him with the highe&s;t Civility.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Indeed,' &s;ays the Landlord, 'I &s;hall u&s;e no &s;uch Civility towards him: For it &s;eems, for all his laced Wai&s;tcoat there, he is no more a Gentleman than my&s;elf; but a poor Pari&s;h Ba&s;tard bred up at a great Squire's about 30 Miles off, and now turned out of Doors, (not for any good to be &s;ure.) I &s;hall get him out of my Hou&s;e as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. If I do lo&s;e my Reckoning, the fir&s;t Lo&s;s is always the be&s;t. It is not above a Year ago that I lo&s;t a Silver-&s;poon.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'What do&s;t thou talk of a Pari&s;h Ba&s;tard, <HI>Robin?'</HI> an&s;wered the Quaker. 'Thou mu&s;t certainly be mi&s;|taken in thy Man.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Not at all,' replied <HI>Robin,</HI> 'the Guide, who knows him very well, told it me.'</Q> For, indeed, the Guide had no &s;ooner taken his Place at the Kitch|en-Fire, than he acquainted the whole Company with all he knew, or had ever heard concerning <HI>Jones.</HI></P>
<P>The Quaker was no &s;ooner a&s;&s;ured by this Fellow of the Birth and low Fortune of <HI>Jones,</HI> than all Com|pa&s;&s;ion for him vani&s;hed; and the hone&s;t, plain Man went home fired with no le&s;s Indignation than a Duke would have felt at receiving an Affront from &s;uch a Per&s;on.</P>
<P>The Landlord him&s;elf conceived an equal Di&s;dain for his Gue&s;t; &s;o that when <HI>Jones</HI> rung the Bell in order to retire to Bed, he was acquainted that he could have no Bed there. Be&s;ides Di&s;dain of the mean Condition of his Gue&s;t, <HI>Robin</HI> entertained violent Su|&s;picion of his Intentions, which were, he &s;uppo&s;ed, to watch &s;ome favourable Opportunity of robbing the Hou&s;e. In reality, he might have been very well ea&s;ed of the&s;e Apprehen&s;ions by the prudent Precau|tions of his Wife and Daughter, who had already re|moved
<PB N="50" REF="59">
every thing which was not fixed to the Free|hold; but he was by Nature &s;u&s;picious, and had been more particularly &s;o &s;ince the Lo&s;s of his Spoon. In &s;hort, the Dread of being robbed, totally ab&s;orbed the comfortable Con&s;ideration that he had nothing to lo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> being a&s;&s;ured that he could have no Bed, ve|ry contentedly betook him&s;elf to a great Chair made with Ru&s;hes, when Sleep, which had lately &s;hunned his Company in much better Apartments, generou&s;ly paid him a Vi&s;it in his humble Cell.</P>
<P>As for the Landlord, he was prevented by his Fears from retiring to Re&s;t. He returned therefore to the Kitchen Fire, whence he would &s;urvey the only Door which opened into the Parlour, or rather, Hole, where <HI>Jones</HI> was &s;eated; and as for the Window to that Room, it was impo&s;&s;ible for any Creature larger than a Cat to have made his E&s;cape through it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. <HI>The Adventure of a Company of Soldiers.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Landlord having taken his Seat directly oppo&s;ite to the Door of the Parlour, determined to keep Guard there the whole Night. The Guide and another Fellow remained long on Duty with him, tho' they neither knew his Su&s;picions, nor had any of their own. The true Cau&s;e of their watching did indeed, at length, put an End to it; for this was no other than the Strength and Goodne&s;s of the Beer, of which having tippled a very large Quantity, they grew at fir&s;t very noi&s;y and vociferous, and afterwards fell both a&s;leep.</P>
<P>But it was not in the Power of Liquor to compo&s;e the Fears of <HI>Robin.</HI> He continued &s;till waking in his Chair, with his Eyes fixed &s;tedfa&s;tly on the Door which led into the Apartment of Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> till a violent Thundering at his outward Gate called him
<PB N="51" REF="60">
from his Seat, and obliged him to open it; which he had no &s;ooner done, than his Kitchen was imme|diately full of Gentlemen in red Coats, who all ru&s;h|ed upon him in as tumultuous a Manner, as if they intended to take his little Ca&s;tle by Storm.</P>
<P>The Landlord was now forced from his Po&s;t to furni&s;h his numerous Gue&s;ts with Beer, which they called for with great Eagerne&s;s; and upon his &s;econd or third Return from the Cellar, he &s;aw Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> &s;tanding before the Fire in the mid&s;t of the Soldiers; for it may ea&s;ily be believed, that the Arrival of &s;o much good Company &s;hould put an End to any Sleep, unle&s;s that from which we are only to be awakened by the la&s;t Trumpet.</P>
<P>The Company having now pretty well &s;atisfied their Thir&s;t, nothing remained but to pay the Reckoning, a Circum&s;tance often productive of much Mi&s;chief and Di&s;content among the inferior Rank of Gentry; who are apt to find great Difficulty in a&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing the Sum, with exact Regard to di&s;tributive Ju&s;tice, which directs, that every Man &s;hall pay according to the Quantity which he drinks. This Difficulty oc|curred upon the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion; and it was the greater, as &s;ome Gentlemen had, in their extreme Hurry, marched off, after their fir&s;t Draught, and had entirely forgot to contribute any thing towards the the &s;aid Reckoning.</P>
<P>A violent Di&s;pute now aro&s;e, in which every Word may be &s;aid to have been depo&s;ed upon Oath; for the Oaths were at lea&s;t equal to all the other Words &s;po|ken. In this Controver&s;y, the whole Company &s;poke together, and every Man &s;eemed wholly bent to exte|nuate the Sum which fell to his Share; &s;o that the mo&s;t probable Conclu&s;ion which could be fore&s;een, was, that a large Portion of the Reckoning would fall to the Landlord's Share to pay, or (what is much the &s;ame thing) would remain unpaid.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="61">
All this while Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> was engaged in Conver&s;a|tion with the Serjeant; for that Officer was entirely unconcerned in the pre&s;ent Di&s;pute, being privileged, by immemorial Cu&s;tom, from all Contribution.</P>
<P>The Di&s;pute now grew &s;o very warm, that it &s;eem|ed to draw towards a military Deci&s;ion, when <HI>Jones</HI> &s;tepping forward, &s;ilenced all their Clamours at once, by declaring that he would pay the whole Reckoning, which indeed amounted to no more than three Shillings and four-pence.</P>
<P>This Declaration procured <HI>Jones</HI> the Thanks and Applau&s;e of the whole Company. The Terms ho|nourable, noble, and worthy Gentleman, re&s;ounded through the Room; nay, my Landlord him&s;elf began to have a better Opinion of him, and almo&s;t to di&s;|believe the Account which the Guide had given.</P>
<P>The Serjeant had informed Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> that they were marching again&s;t the Rebels, and expected to be commanded by the glorious Duke of <HI>Cumberland.</HI> By which the Reader may perceive (a Circum&s;tance which we have not thought nece&s;&s;ary to communicate before) that this was the very Time when the late Rebellion was at the highe&s;t; and indeed the Banditti were now marched into <HI>England,</HI> intending, as it was thought, to fight the King's Forces, and to attempt pu&s;hing forward to the Metropolis.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> had &s;ome Heroic Ingredients in his Compo&s;i|tion, and was a hearty Well-wi&s;her to the glorious Cau&s;e of Liberty, and of the Prote&s;tant Religion. It is no wonder, therefore, that in Circum&s;tances which would have warranted a much more romantic and wild Undertaking, it &s;hould occur to him to &s;erve as a Volunteer in this Expedition.</P>
<P>Our commanding Officer had &s;aid all in his Power to encourage and promote this good Di&s;po&s;ition, from the fir&s;t Moment he had been acquainted with it. He now proclaimed the noble Re&s;olution aloud, which was received with great Plea&s;ure by the whole Com|pany,
<PB N="53" REF="62">
who all cried out, <Q REND="inline">'God ble&s;s King <HI>George,</HI> and your Honour;' and then added, with many Oaths, 'We will &s;tand by you both to the la&s;t Drops of our Blood.'</Q></P>
<P>The Gentleman, who had been all Night tippling at the Alehou&s;e, was prevailed on by &s;ome Arguments which a Corporal had put into his Hand, to under|take the &s;ame Expedition. And now the Portman|teau belonging to Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> being put up in the Bag|gage-cart, the Forces were about to move forwards; when the Guide, &s;tepping up to <HI>Jones,</HI> &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'Sir, I hope you will con&s;ider that the Hor&s;es have been kept out all Night, and we have travelled a great ways out of our Way.'</Q> <HI>Jones</HI> was &s;urprized at the Impudence of this Demand, and acquainted the Soldiers with the Merits of his Cau&s;e, who were all unanimous in condemning the Guide for his Endea|vours to put upon a Gentleman. Some &s;aid, he ought to be tied Neck and Heels; others, that he de&s;erved to run the Gauntlope; and the Serjeant &s;hook his Cane at him, and wi&s;hed he had him under his Com|mand, &s;wearing heartily he would make an Example of him.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> contented him&s;elf, however, with a negative Puni&s;hment, and walked off with his new Comrades, leaving the Guide to the poor Revenge of cur&s;ing and reviling him, in which latter the Landlord joined, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">'Ay, ay, he is a pure one, I warrant you. A pretty Gentleman, indeed, to go for a Soldier. He &s;hall wear a laced Wai&s;tcoat truly. It is an old Proverb and a true one, all is not Gold that gli&s;ters. I am glad my Hou&s;e is well rid of him.'</Q></P>
<P>All that Day the Serjeant and the young Soldier marched together; and the former, who was an arch Fellow, told the latter many entertaining Stories of his Campaigns, tho' in Reality he had never made any; for he was but lately come into the Service, and had, by his own Dexterity, &s;o well ingratiated him|&s;elf
<PB N="54" REF="63">
with his Officers, that he had promoted him&s;elf to a Halberd, chiefly indeed by his Merit in recruiting, in which he was mo&s;t excellently well &s;killed.</P>
<P>Much Mirth and Fe&s;tivity pa&s;&s;ed among the Sol|diers during their March. In which the many Oc|currences that had pa&s;&s;ed at their la&s;t Quarters were remembered, and every one, with great Freedom, made what Jokes he plea&s;ed on his Officers, &s;ome of which were of the coar&s;er Kind, and very near bor|dering on Scandal. This brought to our Heroe's Mind the Cu&s;tom which he had read of among the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> of indulging, on certain Fe&s;tivals and &s;olemn Occa&s;ions, the Liberty to Slaves, of u&s;ing an uncontrouled Freedom of Speech towards their Ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>Our little Army, which con&s;i&s;ted of two Companies of Foot, were now arrived at the Place where they were to halt that Evening. The Serjeant then ac|quainted his Lieutenant, who was the commanding Officer, that they had picked up two Fellows in that Day's March; one of which, he &s;aid, was as fine a Man as ever he &s;aw (meaning the Tippler) for that he was near &s;ix Feet, well-proportioned, and &s;trong|ly limbed; and the other, (meaning <HI>Jones,)</HI> would do well enough for their rear Rank.</P>
<P>The new Soldiers were now produced before the Officer, who having examined the &s;ix Foot Man, he being fir&s;t produced, came next to &s;urvey <HI>Jones;</HI> at the fir&s;t Sight of whom, the Lieutenant could not help &s;hewing &s;ome Surprize; for, be&s;ides that he was very well dre&s;&s;ed, and was naturally genteel, he had a remarkable Air of Dignity in his Look, which is rarely &s;een among the Vulgar, and is indeed not in|&s;eparably annexed to the Features of their Superiors.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Sir,' &s;aid the Lieutenant, 'my Serjeant inform|ed me, that you are de&s;irous of enli&s;ting in the Company I have at pre&s;ent under my command;
<PB N="55" REF="64">
if &s;o, Sir, we &s;hall very gladly receive a Gentleman who promi&s;es to do much Honour to the Company, by bearing Arms in it.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> an&s;wered: <Q REND="inline">'That he had not mentioned any thing of enli&s;ting him&s;elf; that he was mo&s;t zealou&s;|ly attached to the glorious Cau&s;e for which they were going to fight, and was very de&s;irous of &s;erv|ing as a Volunteer;'</Q> concluding with &s;ome Com|pliments to the Lieutenant, and expre&s;&s;ing the great Satisfaction he &s;hould have in being under his Com|mand.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant returned his Civility, commended his Re&s;olution, &s;hook him by the Hand, and invited him to dine with him&s;elf and the re&s;t of the Officers.</P>

<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XII. <HI>The Adventure of a Company of Officers.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Lieutenant, whom we mentioned in the preceding Chapter, and who commanded this Party, was now near &s;ixty Years of Age. He had entered very young into the Army, and had &s;erved in the Capacity of an En&s;ign at the Battle of <HI>Tannieres;</HI> here he had received two Wounds, and had &s;o well di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf, that he was by the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> advanced to be a Lieutenant, immedi|ately after that Battle.</P>
<P>In this Commi&s;&s;ion he had continued ever &s;ince, <HI>viz.</HI> near forty Years; during which Time he had &s;een va&s;t Numbers preferred over his Head, and had now the Mortification to be commanded by Boys, who&s;e Fathers were at Nur&s;e when he had fir&s;t entered into the Service.</P>
<P>Nor was this ill Succe&s;s in his Profe&s;&s;ion &s;olely owing to his having no Friends among the Men in Power. He had the Misfortune to incur the Di&s;plea|&s;ure of his Colonel, who for many Years continued in the Command of this Regiment. Nor did he owe
<PB N="56" REF="65">
the implacable Ill-will which this Man bore him to any Neglect or Deficiency as an Officer, nor indeed to any Fault in him&s;elf; but &s;olely to the Indi&s;cretion of his Wife, who was a very beautiful Woman, and who, tho' &s;he was remarkably fond of her Hu&s;band, would not purcha&s;e his Preferment at the Expence of certain Favours which the Colonel required of her.</P>
<P>The poor Lieutenant was more peculiarly unhap|py in this, that while he felt the Effects of the Enmi|ty of his Colonel, he neither knew, nor &s;u&s;pected, that he really bore him any; for he could not &s;u&s;pect an Ill-will for which he was not con&s;cious of giving any Cau&s;e; and his Wife, fearing what her Hu&s;band's nice Regard to his Honour might have occa&s;ioned, contented her&s;elf with pre&s;erving her Virtue, with|out enjoying the Triumphs of her Conque&s;t.</P>
<P>This unfortunate Officer (for &s;o I think he may be called) had many good Qualities, be&s;ides his Me|rit in his Profe&s;&s;ion; for he was a religious, hone&s;t, good natured Man; and had behaved &s;o well in his Command, that he was highly e&s;teemed and belov|ed, not only by the Soldiers of his own Company; but by the whole Regiment.</P>
<P>The other Officers who marched with him were a <HI>French</HI> Lieutenant, who had been long enough out of <HI>France</HI> to forget his own Language, but not long enough in <HI>England</HI> to learn ours, &s;o that he really &s;poke no Language at all, and could barely make him|&s;elf under&s;tood, on the mo&s;t ordinary Occa&s;ions. There were likewi&s;e two En&s;igns, both very young Fellows; one of whom had been bred under an Attorney, and the other was Son to the Wife of a Nobleman's Butler.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Dinner was ended, <HI>Jones</HI> informed the Company of the Merriment which had pa&s;&s;ed among the Soldiers upon their March; <Q REND="inline">'and yet,' &s;ays he, 'notwith&s;tanding all their Vociferation, I dare &s;wear they will behave more like <HI>Grecians</HI> than <HI>Trojans</HI>

<P>Mr. <HI>Adderley,</HI> which was the Name of the other En&s;ign, had &s;at hitherto kicking his Heels and hum|ming a Tune, without &s;eeming to li&s;ten to the Di&s;|cour&s;e; he now an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">'<HI>O Mon&s;ieur, on ne parle pas de la Religion dans la Guerre.'</HI></Q> <Q REND="inline">'Well &s;aid, <HI>Jack,'</HI> cries <HI>Northerton,</HI> 'if la Religion was the only Matter, the Par&s;ons &s;hould fight their own Battles for me.'</Q></P>

<P><HI>Northerton</HI> now winked on <HI>Adderley,</HI> and whi&s;|pered to him &s;lily, <Q REND="inline">'Smoke the Prig, <HI>Adderley,</HI> &s;moke him.'</Q> Then turning to <HI>Jones,</HI> &s;aid to him, <Q REND="inline">'I am very glad, Sir, you have cho&s;en our Regi|ment
<PB N="59" REF="68">
to be a Volunteer in: For if our Par&s;on &s;hould at any Time take a Cup too much, I find you can &s;upply his Place. I pre&s;ume, Sir, you have been at the Univer&s;ity, may I crave the Favour to know what College?'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Sir,' an&s;wered <HI>Jones,</HI> '&s;o far from having been at the Univer&s;ity, I have not even had the Advantage of your&s;elf: for I was never at School.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'I pre&s;umed,' cries the En&s;ign, 'only upon the Information of your great Learning'</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">Oh! Sir,' an&s;wered <HI>Jones,</HI> 'it is as po&s;&s;ible for a Man to know &s;omething without having been at School; as it is to have been at School and to know nothing.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Well &s;aid, young Volunteer,' cries the Lieute|nant, 'upon my Word, <HI>Northerton,</HI> you had better let him alone, for he will be too hard for you.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Northerton</HI> did not very well reli&s;h the Sarca&s;m of <HI>Jones;</HI> but he thought the Provocation was &s;carce &s;uf|ficient to ju&s;tify a Blow, or a Ra&s;cal, or Scoundrel, which were the only Repartees that &s;ugge&s;ted them|&s;elves. He was, therefore, &s;ilent at pre&s;ent; but re&s;olved to take the fir&s;t Opportunity of returning the Je&s;t by Abu&s;e.</P>
<P>It now came to the Turn of Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> to give a Toa&s;t, as it is called; who could not refrain from mentioning his dear <HI>Sophia.</HI> This he did the more readily, as he imagined it utterly impo&s;&s;ible, that any one pre&s;ent &s;hould gue&s;s the Per&s;on he meant.</P>
<P>But the Lieutenant, who was the Toa&s;t-ma&s;ter, was not contented with <HI>Sophia</HI> only. He &s;aid, he mu&s;t have her Sir-name; upon which <HI>Jones</HI> he&s;itated a little, and pre&s;ently after named Mi&s;s <HI>Sophia We&s;|tern.</HI> En&s;ign <HI>Northerton</HI> declared, he would not drink her Health, in the &s;ame Round with his own Toa&s;t, unle&s;s &s;omebody would vouch for her. <Q REND="inline">'I knew one <HI>Sophy We&s;tern,'</HI> &s;ays he, that was lain|with by half the young Fellows at <HI>Bath;</HI> and, per|haps, this is the &s;ame Woman.'</Q> <HI>Jones</HI> very &s;olemn|ly
<PB N="60" REF="69">
a&s;&s;ured him of the contrary; a&s;&s;erting that the young Lady he named was one of great Fa&s;hion and Fortune. <Q REND="inline">'Ay, ay,' &s;ays the En&s;ign, 'and &s;o &s;he is, d&mdash;n me it is the &s;ame Woman, and I'll hold Half a Dozen of <HI>Burgundy, Tom French</HI> of our Regiment brings her into Company with us at any Tavern in <HI>Bridges-&s;treet.'</HI></Q> He then proceeded to de&s;cribe her Per&s;on exactly, (for he had &s;een her with her Aunt) and concluded with &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">'That her Father had a great E&s;tate in <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire.'</HI></Q></P>
<P>The Tenderne&s;s of Lovers can ill brook the lea&s;t je&s;ting with the Names of their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. How|ever, <HI>Jones,</HI> tho' he had enough of the Lover and of the Heroe too in his Di&s;po&s;ition, did not re&s;ent the&s;e Slanders as ha&s;tily as, perhaps, he ought to have done. To &s;ay the Truth, having &s;een but little of this Kind of Wit, he did not readily under&s;tand it, and for a long Time imagined Mr. <HI>Northerton</HI> had really mi&s;taken his Charmer for &s;ome other. But now turning to the En&s;ign with a &s;tern A&s;pect, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'Pray, Sir, chu&s;e &s;ome other Subject for your Wit: For I promi&s;e you I will bear no je&s;ting with this Lady's Character.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Je&s;ting,' cries the other, 'd&mdash;n me if ever I was more in Earne&s;t in my Life. <HI>Tom French</HI> of our Regiment had both her and her Aunt at <HI>Bath.'</HI></Q> <Q REND="inline">'Then I mu&s;t tell you in Earne&s;t,' cries <HI>Jones,</HI> 'that you are one of the mo&s;t impudent Ra&s;cals upon Earth.'</Q></P>
<P>He had no &s;ooner &s;poken the&s;e Words, than the En&s;ign, together with a Volly of Cur&s;es, di&s;charged a Bottle full at the Head of <HI>Jones,</HI> which hitting him a little above the right Temple, brought him in&s;tantly to the Ground.</P>
<P>The Conqueror perceiving the Enemy to lie mo|tionle&s;s before him, and Blood beginning to flow pretty plentifully from his Wound, began now to think of quitting the Field of Battle, where no more
<PB N="61" REF="70">
Honour was to be gotten; but the Lieutenant inter|po&s;ed, by &s;tepping before the Door, and thus cut off his Retreat.</P>
<P><HI>Northerton</HI> was very importunate with the Lieu|tenant for his Liberty; urging the ill Con&s;equences of his Stay, a&s;king him, what could he have done le&s;s! <Q REND="inline">'Zounds!' &s;ays he, 'I was but in Je&s;t with the Fellow. I never heard any Harm of Mi&s;s <HI>We&s;tern</HI> in my Life.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Have not you?' &s;aid the Lieute|nant. 'then you richly de&s;erve to be hanged, as well for making &s;uch Je&s;ts, as for u&s;ing &s;uch a Weapon. You are my Pri&s;oner, Sir; nor &s;hall you &s;tir from hence, till a proper Guard comes to &s;ecure you.'</Q></P>
<P>Such an A&s;cendant had our Lieutenant over this En&s;ign, that all that Fervency of Courage which had levelled our poor Heroe with the Floor, would &s;carce have animated the &s;aid En&s;ign to have drawn his &s;word again&s;t the Lieutenant, had he then had one dangling at his Side; but all the Swords being hung up in the Room, were at the very Beginning of the Fray, &s;ecured by the <HI>French</HI> Officer. So that Mr. <HI>Northerton</HI> was obliged to attend the final I&s;&s;ue of this Affair.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Gentleman and Mr. <HI>Adderley,</HI> at the De&s;ire of their Commanding-Officer, had rai&s;ed up the Body of <HI>Jones;</HI> but as they could perceive but little (if any) &s;ign of Life in him, they again let him fall. <HI>Adderley</HI> damning him for having blooded his Wai&s;tcoat; and the <HI>Frenchman</HI> declaring, <Q REND="inline">'Be|gar me no tu&s;h de Engli&s;eman de mort, me ave heard de Engli&s;e Ley, Law, what you call, hang up de Man dat tu&s;h him la&s;t.'</Q></P>
<P>When the good Lieutenant applied him&s;elf to the Door, he applied him&s;elf likewi&s;e to the Bell; and the Drawer immediately attending, he di&s;patched him for a File of Mu&s;queteers and a Surgeon. The&s;e Commands, together with the Drawer's Report of what he had him&s;elf &s;een, not only produced the Soliders, but pre&s;ently drew up the Landlord of the
<PB N="62" REF="71">
Hou&s;e, his Wife and Servants, and, indeed, every one el&s;e, who happened, at that Time, to be in the Inn.</P>
<P>To de&s;cribe every Particular, and to relate the whole Conver&s;ation of the en&s;uing Scene, is not within my Power, unle&s;s I had forty Pens, and could, at once, write with them altogether, as the Company now &s;poke. The Reader mu&s;t, therefore, content him&s;elf with the mo&s;t remarkable Incidents, and perhaps he may very well excu&s;e the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing done, was &s;ecuring the Body of <HI>Northerton,</HI> who being delivered into the Cu&s;tody of &s;ix Men with a Corporal at their Head, was by them conducted from a Place which he was very willing to leave, but it was unluckily to a Place whither he was very unwilling to go. To &s;ay the Truth, &s;o whim&s;ical are the De&s;ires of Ambition, the very Mo|ment this Youth had attained the above-mentioned Honour, he would have been well contented to have retired to &s;ome Corner of the World, where the Fame of it &s;hould never have reached his Ears.</P>
<P>It &s;urprizes us, and &s;o, perhaps, it may the Reader, that the Lieutenant, a worthy and good Man, &s;hould have applied his chief Care, rather to &s;ecure the Of|fender, than to pre&s;erve the Life of the wounded Per|&s;on. We mention this Ob&s;ervation, not with any View of pretending to account for &s;o odd a Beha|viour, but le&s;t &s;ome Critic &s;hould hereafter plume him&s;elf on di&s;covering it. We would have the&s;e Gentlemen know we can &s;ee what is odd in Charac|ters as well as them&s;elves, but it is our Bu&s;ine&s;s to relate Facts as they are; which when we have done, it is the Part of the learned and &s;agacious Reader to con&s;ult that original Book of Nature, whence every Pa&s;&s;age in our Work is tran&s;cribed, tho' we quote not always the particular Page for its Authority.</P>
<P>The Company which now arrived were of a dif|ferent Di&s;po&s;ition. They &s;u&s;pended their Curio&s;ity
<PB N="63" REF="72">
concerning the Per&s;on of the En&s;ign, till they &s;hould &s;ee him hereafter in a more engaging Attitude. At pre&s;ent, their whole Concern and Attention were employed about the bloody Object on the Floor; which being placed upright in a Chair, &s;oon began to di&s;cover &s;ome Symptoms of Life and Motion. The&s;e were no &s;ooner perceived by the Company (for <HI>Jones</HI> was, at fir&s;t, generally concluded to be dead) than they all fell at once to pre&s;cribing for him: (For as none of the phy&s;ical Order was pre&s;ent, every one there took that Office upon him.)</P>
<P>Bleeding was the Unanimous Voice of the whole Room; but unluckily there was no Operator at hand: Every one then cry'd, 'Call the Barber'; but none &s;tirred a Step. Several Cordials were like|wi&s;e pre&s;cribed in the &s;ame ineffective Manner; till the Landlord ordered up a Tankard of his &s;trong Beer, with a Toa&s;t, which he &s;aid was the be&s;t Cor|dial in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Per&s;on principally a&s;&s;i&s;tant on this Occa&s;ion, indeed the only one who did any Service, or &s;eemed likely to do any, was the Landlady. She cut off &s;ome of her Hair, and applied it to the Wound to &s;top the Blood. She fell to chafing the Youth's Temples with her Hand; and having expre&s;t great Contempt for her Hu&s;band's Pre&s;cription of Beer, &s;he di&s;patched one of her Maids to her own Clo&s;et for a Bottle of Brandy, of which, as &s;oon as it was brought, &s;he prevailed upon <HI>Jones,</HI> who was ju&s;t re|turned to his Sen&s;es, to drink a very large and plen|tiful Draught.</P>
<P>Soon afterwards arrived the Surgeon, who having viewed the Wound, having &s;haken his Head, and blamed every Thing which was done, ordered his Patient in&s;tantly to Bed; in which Place, we think proper to leave him, &s;ome Time, to his Repo&s;e, and &s;hall here, therefore, put an End to this Chap|ter.</P>

<P>WHEN the wounded Man was carried to his Bed, and the Hou&s;e began again to clear up from the Hurry which this Accident had occa&s;ioned; the Landlady thus addre&s;&s;ed the commanding Officer. <Q REND="inline">'I am afraid, Sir,' &s;aid &s;he, 'this young Man did not behave him&s;elf as well as he &s;hould do to your Honours; and if he had been killed, I &s;uppo&s;e he had had but his <HI>De&s;arts;</HI> to be &s;ure when Gentle|men admit inferior <HI>Par&s;ons</HI> into their Company, they <HI>oft</HI> to keep their Di&s;tance; but, as my fir&s;t Hu&s;band u&s;ed to &s;ay, few of them knew how to do it. For my own Part, I am &s;ure, I &s;hould not have &s;uffered any Fellows to <HI>include</HI> them&s;elves into Gentlemen's Company: but I <HI>thoft</HI> he had been an Officer him&s;elf, till the Serjeant told me he was but a Recruit.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Landlady,' an&s;wered the Lieutenant, 'you mi&s;|take the whole Matter. The young Man behaved him&s;elf extremely well, and is, I believe a much better Gentleman than the En&s;ign, who abu&s;ed him. If the young Fellow dies, the Man who &s;truck him will have mo&s;t Rea&s;on to be &s;orry for it: For the Regiment will get rid of a very trouble|&s;ome Fellow, who is a Scandal to the Army; and if he e&s;capes from the Hands of Ju&s;tice, blame me, Madam, that's all.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Ay! Ay! good Lack-a-day!' &s;aid the Land|lady, 'who could have <HI>thoft</HI> it? Ay, ay, ay, I am &s;atisfied your Honour will &s;ee Ju&s;tice done; and to be &s;ure it <HI>oft</HI> to be to every one. Gentlemen <HI>oft</HI> not to kill poor Folks without an&s;wering for it.

<P><Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Madam, &s;aid the Lieutenant, you do the Volunteer wrong; I dare &s;wear he is more of a Gentleman than the Officer.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Ay,' cries the Lanlady, 'why look you there now: Well, my fir&s;t Hu&s;band was a wi&s;e Man; he u&s;ed to &s;ay, you can't always know the In&s;ide by the Out&s;ide. Nay, that might have been well enough too: For I never <HI>&s;aw'd</HI> him till he was all over Blood. Who would have <HI>thoft</HI> it! mayhap, &s;ome young Gentleman cro&s;t in Love. Good Lack-a-day! if he &s;hould die, what a Concern it would be to his Parents! Why &s;ure the Devil mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s the wicked Wretch to do &s;uch an Act. To be &s;ure he is a Scandal to the Army, as your Ho|nour &s;ays: For mo&s;t of the Gentlemen of the Ar|my that ever I &s;aw, are quite different Sort of Peo|ple, and look as if they would &s;corn to &s;pill any Chri&s;tian Blood as much as any Men. I mean, that is, in a civil Way, as my fir&s;t Hu&s;band u&s;ed to &s;ay. To be &s;ure, when they come into the Wars, there mu&s;t be Blood-&s;hed; but they are not to be blamed for that. The more of our Ene|mies they kill there, the better; and I wi&s;h, with all my Heart, they could kill every Mother's Son' of them.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'O fie! Madam,' &s;aid the Lieutenant &s;miling, 'ALL is rather too bloody-minded a Wi&s;h.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Not at all, Sir,' an&s;wered &s;he, 'I am not at all bloody-minded, only to our Enemies, and there is no Harm in that. To be &s;ure it is natural for us to wi&s;h our Enemies, dead, that the Wars may be at an End, and our Taxes be lowered: For it is a dreadful Thing to pay as we do.

<P>She was proceeding in this Manner, when the Sur|geon entered the Room. The Lieutenant immedi|ately a&s;ked how his Patient did? But he re&s;olved him only by &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">'Better, I believe, than he would have been by this Time, if I had not been called; and even as it is, perhaps it would have been lucky if I could have been called &s;ooner.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">I hope, Sir,' &s;aid the Lieutenant, 'the Skull is not fractured.' Hum,' cries the Surgeon, 'Fractures are not al|ways the mo&s;t dangerous Symptoms. Contu&s;ions and Lacerations are often attended with wor&s;e Phaenomena, and with more fatal Con&s;equences than Fractures. People who know nothing of the Matter conclude, if the Skull is not fractured, all is well; whereas, I had rather &s;ee a Man's Skull broke all to Pieces, than &s;ome Contu&s;ions I have met with. I hope,' &s;ays the Lieutenant, 'there are no &s;uch Symptoms here:'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Symptoms,' an|&s;wered the Surgeon, 'are not always regular nor con|&s;tant.

To prevent which I pre&s;ently made a large Orifice in the Vein of the left Arm, whence I drew twenty Ounces of Blood; which I expected to have found extremely &s;izy and glutinous, or indeed coagulated, as it is in pleuritic Com|plaints; but, to my Surprize, it appeared ro&s;y and florid, and its Con&s;i&s;tency differed little from the Blood of tho&s;e in perfect Health. I then applied a Fomentation to the Part, which highly an&s;wered the Intention, and after three or four Times dre&s;&s;ing, the Wound began to di&s;charge a thick Pus or Matter, by which Means the Cohe&s;ion&mdash;but perhaps I do not make my&s;elf perfectly well under&s;tood.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'No real|ly,' an&s;wered the Lieutenant, 'I cannot &s;ay I un|der&s;tand a Syllable.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Well, Sir,' &s;aid the Sur|geon, 'then I &s;hall not tire your Patience; in &s;hort, within &s;ix Weeks, my Patient was able to walk up|on his Legs, as perfectly as he could have done be|fore he received the Contu&s;ion.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I wi&s;h, Sir,' &s;aid the Lieutenant, 'you would be &s;o kind only to inform me, whether the Wound this young Gen|tleman hath had the Misfortune to receive is likely to prove mortal?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Sir,' an&s;wered the Surgeon, 'to &s;ay whether a Wound will prove mortal or not at fir&s;t Dre&s;&s;ing, would be very weak and fooli&s;h Pre|&s;umption: We are all mortal, and Symptoms often occur in a Cure which the greate&s;t of our Profe&s;&s;i|on could never fore&s;ee.'</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'But do you think him in Danger?'</Q> &s;ays the other. <Q REND="inline">'In Danger! ay, &s;urely,' cries the Doctor, 'who is there among us, who in the mo&s;t perfect Health can be &s;aid not to be in Danger? Can a Man, therefore, with &s;o bad a Wound as this be &s;aid to be out of Danger? All I can &s;ay, at pre&s;ent, is, that it is well I was called as I was, and perhaps it would have been

I will &s;ee him again early in the Morning, and in the mean Time let him be kept extremely quiet, and drink liberal|ly of Water-Gruel.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Won't you allow him Sack-whey,' &s;aid the Landlady?</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Ay, ay, Sack-whey,' cries the Doctor, 'if you will, provided it be very &s;mall.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'And a little Chicken-broth too,' added &s;he?'</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'Yes, yes, Chicken-broth,' &s;aid the Doc|tor, 'is very good.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'May'nt I make him &s;ome Jellies too,' &s;aid the Landlady?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Ay, ay,' an|&s;wered the Doctor, 'Jellies are very good for Wounds, for they promote Cohe&s;ion.'</Q> And, in|deed, it was lucky &s;he had not named Soop or high Sauces, for the Doctor would have complied, rather than have lo&s;t the Cu&s;tom of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The Doctor was no &s;ooner gone, than the Land|lady began to trumpet forth his Fame to the Lieute|nant, who had not, from their &s;hort Acquaintance conceived quite &s;o favourable an Opinion of his phy|&s;ical Abilities, as the good Woman, and all the Neigh|bourhood entertained; (and indeed very rightly) for tho' I am afraid the Doctor was a little of a Cox|comb, he might be neverthele&s;s very much of a Sur|geon.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant having collected from the learn|ed Di&s;cour&s;e of the Surgeon, that Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> was in great Danger, gave Orders for keeping Mr. <HI>Norther|ton</HI> under a very &s;trict Guard, intending in the Morn|ing to attend him to a Ju&s;tice of Peace, and to com|mit the conducting the Troops to <HI>Gloce&s;ter</HI> to the <HI>French</HI> Lieutenant, who, tho' he could neither read, write, nor &s;peak any language, was, however, a good Officer.</P>
<P>In the Evening our Commander &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> that if a Vi&s;it would not be trouble|&s;ome he would wait on him. This Civility was very kindly and thankfully received by <HI>Jones,</HI> and the Lieutenant accordingly went up to his Room;
<PB N="69" REF="78">
where he found the wounded Man much better than he expected; nay, <HI>Jones</HI> a&s;&s;ured his Friend, that if he had not received expre&s;s Orders to the contrary from the Surgeon, he &s;hould have got up long ago: For he appeared to him&s;elf to be as well as ever, and felt no other Inconvenience from his Wound but an extreme Sorene&s;s on that Side of his Head.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'I &s;hould be very glad,' quoth the Lieutenant, 'that you was as well as you fancy your&s;elf: For then you would be able to do your&s;elf Ju&s;tice immedi|ately; for when a Matter can't be made up, as in Ca&s;e of a Blow, the &s;ooner you take him out the better; but I am afraid you think your&s;elf better than you are, and he would have too much Ad|vantage over you.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'I'll try, however,' an&s;wered <HI>Jones,</HI> 'if you plea&s;e, and will be &s;o kind to lend me a Sword: For I have none here of my own.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'My Sword is heartily at your Service,' my dear Boy, cries the Lieutenant, ki&s;&s;ing him, 'you are, a brave Lad, and I love your Spirit; but I fear your Strength: For &s;uch a Blow, and &s;o much Lo&s;s of Blood, mu&s;t have very much weakened you; and tho' you feel no Want of Strength in your Bed, yet you mo&s;t probably would after a Thru&s;t or two. I can't con&s;ent to your taking him out To-night; but I hope you will be able to come up with us before we get many Days March ad|vance; and I give you my Honour you &s;hall have Satisfaction, or the Man who hath injured you &s;han't &s;tay in our Regiment.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'I wi&s;h,' &s;aid <HI>Jones,</HI> 'it was po&s;&s;ible to decide this Matter To-night; now you have mentioned it to me, I &s;hall not be able to re&s;t.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'O never think of it,' returned the other, 'a few Days will make no Difference. The Wounds of

<P><Q REND="inline">'But &s;uppo&s;e,' &s;ays <HI>Jones,</HI> 'I &s;hould grow wor&s;e, and die of the Con&s;equences of my pre&s;ent Wound.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Then your Honour,' an&s;wered the Lieutenant, 'will require no Reparation at all. I my&s;elf will do Ju&s;tice to your Character, and will te&s;tify to the World your Intention to have acted properly, if you had recovered.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Still,' replied <HI>Jones,</HI> 'I am concerned at the Delay. I am almo&s;t afraid to mention it to you who are a Soldier; but tho' I have been a very wild young Fellow, &s;till in my mo&s;t &s;erious Moments, and at the Bottom, I am really a Chri&s;tian.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'So am I too, I a&s;&s;ure you,' &s;aid the Officer: 'And &s;o zealous a one, that I was plea&s;ed with you at Dinner for taking up the Cau&s;e of your Religion: and I am a little offended with you now, young Gentleman, that you &s;hould expre&s;s a Fear of de|claring your Faith before any one.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'But how terrible mu&s;t it be,' cries <HI>Jones,</HI> 'to any one who is really a Chri&s;tian, to cheri&s;h Malice in his Brea&s;t, in Oppo&s;ition to the Command of him who hath expre&s;ly forbid it? How can I bear to do this on a &s;ick Bed? Or how &s;hall I make up my Account, with &s;uch an Article as this in my' Bo&s;om again&s;t me?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Why I believe there is &s;uch a Command,' cries the Lieutenant; 'but a Man of Honour can't keep it. And you mu&s;t be a Man of Honour, if you will be in the Army. I remember I once put the Ca&s;e to our Chaplain over a Bowl of Punch, and he confe&s;&s;ed there was much Difficulty in it; but &s;aid, he hoped there might be a Latitude granted to Soldiers in this one In&s;tance; and to be &s;ure it is our Duty to hope &s;o: For who would bear to

<P>But tho' the Lieutenant's Rea&s;oning was very &s;a|tisfactory to him&s;elf, it was not entirely &s;o to his Friend. <HI>Jones</HI> therefore having revolved this Mat|ter much in his Thoughts, at la&s;t came to a Re&s;olu|tion, which the Reader will find in the next Chap|ter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. <HI>A mo&s;t dreadful Chapter indeed; and which few Rea|ders ought to venture upon in an Evening, e&s;pecial|ly when alone.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>JONES</HI> &s;wallowed a large Me&s;s of Chicken, or rather Cock, Broth, with a very good Appetite, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> indeed he would have done the Cock it was made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">f, with a Pound of Bacon into the Bargain; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ow, finding in him&s;elf no Deficiency of either Health or Spirit, he re&s;olved to get up and &s;eek his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nemy.</P>
<P>But fir&s;t he &s;ent for the Serjeant, who was his fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">cquaintance among the&s;e military Gentlemen. Un|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ckily that worthy Officer having, in a literal Sen&s;e,
<PB N="72" REF="81">
taken his Fill of Liquor, had been &s;ome Time re|tired to his Bol&s;ter, where he was &s;noaring &s;o loud, that it was not ea&s;y to convey a Noi&s;e in at his Ears capable of drowning that which i&s;&s;ued from hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> No&s;|trils.</P>
<P>However, as <HI>Jones</HI> per&s;i&s;ted in his De&s;ire of &s;eeing him, a vociferous Drawer at length found Means to di&s;turb his Slumbers, and to acquaint him with the Me&s;&s;age. Of which the Serjeant was no &s;ooner made &s;en&s;ible, than he aro&s;e from his Bed, and having his Clothes already on, immediately attended. <HI>Jones</HI> did not think fit to acquaint the Serjeant with his De|&s;ign, tho' he might have done it with great Safety; for the Halberdier was him&s;elf a Man of Honour, and had killed his Man. He would therefore have faith|fully kept this Secret, or indeed any other which no Reward was publi&s;hed for di&s;covering. But as <HI>Jones</HI> knew not the&s;e Virtues in &s;o &s;hort an Acquaintance, his Caution was perhaps prudent and commendable enough.</P>
<P>He began therefore by acquainting the Serjeant, that now he was entered into the Army, he was a&s;hamed of being without what was perhaps the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Implement of a Soldier, namely, a Sword; adding, that he &s;hould be infinitely obliged to him if he could procure one. <Q REND="inline">'For which,' &s;ays he, 'I will give you any rea&s;onable Price. Nor do I in|&s;i&s;t upon its being Silver-hilted, only a good Blade, and &s;uch as may become a Soldier's Thigh.'</Q></P>
<P>The Serjeant, who well knew what had happened, and had heard that <HI>Jones</HI> was in a very dangerous Condition, immediately concluded, from &s;uch a Me&s;&s;age, at &s;uch a Time of Night, and from a Man in &s;uch a Situation, that he was light-headed. Now as he had his Wit (to u&s;e that Word in its common Signification) always ready, he bethought him&s;elf of making his Advantage of this Humour in the &s;ick Man. <Q REND="inline">'Sir,' &s;ays he, 'I believe I can fit you. I
<PB N="73" REF="82">
have a mo&s;t excellent Piece of Stuff by me. It is not indeed Silver-hilted, which, as you &s;ay, doth not become a Soldier; but the Handle is decent enough, and the Blade one of the be&s;t in <HI>Europe.&mdash;</HI>It is a Blade that&mdash;a Blade that&mdash;In &s;hort, I will fetch it you this In&s;tant, and you &s;hall &s;ee it and handle it.&mdash;I am glad to &s;ee your Honour &s;o well with all my Heart.'</Q></P>
<P>Being in&s;tantly returned with the Sword, he de|livered it to <HI>Jones,</HI> who took it and drew it; and then told the Serjeant it would do very well, and bid him name his Price.</P>
<P>The Serjeant now began to harangue in Prai&s;e of his Goods. He &s;aid (nay he &s;wore very heartily) <Q REND="inline">'that the Blade was taken from a <HI>French</HI> Officer of very high Rank, at the Battle of <HI>Dettingen.</HI> I took it my&s;elf,' &s;ays he, 'from his Side after I had knocked him o' the Head. The Hilt was a golden one. That I &s;old to one of our fine Gentlemen; for there are &s;ome of them, an't plea&s;e your Ho|nour, who value the Hilt of a Sword more than the Blade.'</Q></P>
<P>Here the other &s;topped him, and begged him to name a Price. The Serjeant, who thought <HI>Jones</HI> ab|&s;olutely out of his Sen&s;es, and very near his End, was afraid, le&s;t he &s;hould injure his Family by a&s;king too little&mdash;However, after a Moment's He&s;itation, he contented him&s;elf with naming twenty Guineas, and &s;wore he would not &s;ell it for le&s;s to his own Brother.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">Twenty Guineas!' &s;ays <HI>Jones,</HI> in the utmo&s;t Sur|prize, '&s;ure you think I am mad, or that I never &s;aw a Sword in my Life. Twenty Guineas indeed!

<P><PB N="74" REF="83">
The Serjeant, as we have &s;aid, had always his Wit <HI>(in &s;en&s;u praedicto)</HI> about him, and now plainly &s;aw that <HI>Jones</HI> was not in the Condition he had apprehend|ed him to be; he now, therefore, counterfeited as great Surprize as the other had &s;hewn, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'I am certain, Sir, I have not a&s;ked you &s;o much out of the way. Be&s;ides, you are to con&s;ider, it is the only Sword I have, and I mu&s;t run the Ri&s;que of my Officer's Di&s;plea&s;ure, by going without one my&s;elf. And truly, putting all this together, I don't think twenty Shillings was &s;o much out of the Way.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Twenty Shillings!' cries <HI>Jones,</HI> 'why you ju&s;t now a&s;ked me twenty Guineas.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'How! cries the Serjeant&mdash;'Sure your Honour mu&s;t have mi&s;taken me; or el&s;e I mi&s;took my&s;elf&mdash;and indeed I am but half awake&mdash;Twenty Guineas indeed! no wonder your Honour flew into &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;ion.

<P>Here <HI>Jones</HI> interrupted him, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">'I will be &s;o far from making any Words with you, that I will give you a Shilling more than your Demand.'</Q> He then gave him a Guinea, bid him return to his Bed, and wi&s;hed him a good March; adding, he hoped to overtake them before the Divi&s;ion reached <HI>Worce&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>The Serjeant very civilly took his Leave, fully &s;atisfied with his Merchandize, and not a little plea&s;ed with his dextrous Recovery from that fal&s;e Step into which his Opinion of the Sick Man's Light-headed|ne&s;s had betrayed him.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Serjeant was departed, <HI>Jones</HI> ro&s;e from his Bed, and dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf entirely, putting on even his Coat, which, as its colour was white,

&s;hewed very vi&s;ibly the Streams of Blood which had flowed down it; and now, having gra&s;ped his new|purcha&s;ed Sword in his Hand, he was going to i&s;&s;ue forth, when the Thought of what he was about to undertake laid &s;uddenly hold of him, and he began to reflect that in a few Minutes he might po&s;&s;ibly deprive a human Being of Life, or might lo&s;e his own. <Q REND="inline">'Ve|ry well,' &s;aid he, 'and in what Cau&s;e do I venture my Life?

<P>The Clock had now &s;truck Twelve, and every one in the Hou&s;e were in their Beds, except the Cen|tinel who &s;tood to guard <HI>Northerton,</HI> when <HI>Jones</HI> &s;oftly opening his Door, i&s;&s;ued forth in Pur&s;uit of his Enemy, of who&s;e Place of Confinement he had re|ceived a perfect De&s;cription from the Drawer. It is not ea&s;y to conceive a much more tremendous Figure than he now exhibited. He had on, as we have &s;aid, a light-coloured Coat, covered with Streams of Blood. His Face, which mi&s;&s;ed that very Blood, as well as twenty Ounces more drawn from him by the Surgeon, was pallid. Round his Head was a Quantity of Bandage, not unlike a Turban. In the right Hand he carried a Sword, and in the left a Can|dle. So that the bloody <HI>Banquo</HI> was not worthy to be compared to him. In Fact, I believe a more dreadful Apparition was never rai&s;ed in a Church-yard, nor in the Imagination of any good People met in a Winter Evening over a Chri&s;tmas Fire in <HI>Somer|&s;et&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="85">
When the Centinel fir&s;t &s;aw our Heroe approach, his Hair began gently to lift up his Grenadier's Cap; and in the &s;ame In&s;tant his Knees fell to Blows with each other. Pre&s;ently his whole Body was &s;eized with wor&s;e than an Ague Fit. He then fired his Piece, and fell flat on his Face.</P>
<P>Whether Fear or Courage was the Occa&s;ion of his Firing, or whether he took Aim at the Object of his Terror, I cannot &s;ay. If he did, however, he had the good Fortune to mi&s;s his Man.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> &s;eeing the Fellow fall, gue&s;&s;ed the Cau&s;e of his Fright, at which he could not forbear &s;miling, not in the lea&s;t reflecting on the Danger from which he had ju&s;t e&s;caped. He then pa&s;&s;ed by the Fellow, who &s;till continued in the Po&s;ture in which he fell, and en|tered the Room where <HI>Northerton,</HI> as he had heard, was confined. Here, in a &s;olitary Situation he found&mdash;an empty Quart Pot &s;tanding on the Table, on which &s;ome Beer being &s;plit, looked as if the Room had lately been inhabited; but at pre&s;ent it was en|tirely vacant.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> then apprehended it might lead to &s;ome other Apartment; but, upon &s;earching all round it, he could perceive no other Door than that at which he entered, and where the Centinel had been po&s;ted. He then proceeded to call <HI>Northerton</HI> &s;everal Times by his Name; but no one an&s;wered; nor did this &s;erve to any other Purpo&s;e than to confirm the Centinel in his Terrors, who was now convinced that the Vo|lunteer was dead of his Wounds, and that his Gho&s;t was come in Search of the Murtherer: He now lay in all the Agonies of Horror, and I wi&s;h, with all my Heart, &s;ome of tho&s;e Actors, who are hereafter to repre&s;ent a Man frighted out of his Wits, had &s;een him, that they might be taught to copy Nature in&s;tead of performing &s;everal antic Tricks and Ge&s;tures, for the Entertainment and Applau&s;e of the Galleries.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="86">
Perceiving the Bird was flown, at lea&s;t de&s;pairing to find him, and rightly apprehending that the Report of the Firelock would alarm the whole Hou&s;e, our Heroe now blew out his Candle, and gently &s;tole back again to his Chamber, and to his Bed: Whi|ther he would not have been able to have gotten un|di&s;covered, had any other Per&s;on been on the &s;ame Stair-ca&s;e, &s;ave only one Gentleman who was con|fined to his Bed by the Gout; for before he could reach the Door to his Chamber, the Hall where the Centinel had been po&s;ted was half full of People. Some in their Shirts, and others not half dre&s;t, all very earne&s;tly enquiring of each other, what was the Matter?</P>
<P>The Soldier was now found lying in the &s;ame Place and Po&s;ture in which we ju&s;t before left him. Seve|ral immediately applied them&s;elves to rai&s;e him, and &s;ome concluded him dead: But they pre&s;ently &s;aw their Mi&s;take; for he not only &s;truggled with tho&s;e who laid their Hands on him, but fell a roaring like a Bull. In reality, he imagined &s;o many Spirits or Devils were handling him; for his Imagination be|ing po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the Horror of an Apparition, con|verted every Object he &s;aw or felt, into nothing but Gho&s;ts and Spectres.</P>
<P>At length he was overpowered by Numbers, and got upon his Legs; when Candles being brought, and &s;eeing two or three of his Comrades pre&s;ent, he came a little to him&s;elf; but when they a&s;ked him what was the Matter? he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">'I am a dead Man, that's all, I'm a dead Man. I can't recover it. I have &s;een him.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">What ha&s;t thou &s;een, <HI>Jack,'</HI></Q> &s;ays one of the Soldiers. <Q REND="inline">'Why I have &s;een the young Volunteer that was killed Ye&s;terday.'</Q> He then imprecated the mo&s;t heavy Cur&s;es on him&s;elf, if he had not &s;een the Volunteer, all over Blood, vo|miting Fire out of his Mouth and No&s;trils, pa&s;s by him into the Chamber where En&s;ign <HI>Northerton</HI> was,
<PB N="78" REF="87">
and then &s;eizing the En&s;ign by the Throat, fly away with him in a Clap of Thunder.</P>
<P>This Relation met with a gracious Reception from the Audience. All the Women pre&s;ent believed it firmly, and prayed Heaven to defend them from Murther. Among&s;t the Men too, many had Faith in the Story; but others turned it into Deri&s;ion and Ridicule; and a Serjeant who was pre&s;ent, an&s;wered very coolly: <Q REND="inline">'Young Man, you will hear more of this for going to &s;leep, and dreaming on your Po&s;t.'</Q></P>
<P>The Soldier replied, <Q REND="inline">'You may puni&s;h me if you plea&s;e; but I was as broad awake as I am now; and the Devil carry me away, as he hath the En|&s;ign, if I did not &s;ee the dead Man as I tell you, with Eyes as big and as fiery as two large Flam|beaux.'</Q></P>
<P>The Commander of the Forces, and the Com|mander of the Hou&s;e, were now both arrived: For the former being awake at the Time, and hearing the Centinel fire his Piece, thought it his Duty to ri&s;e im|mediately, though he had no great Apprehen&s;ions of any Mi&s;chief; whereas the Apprehen&s;ions of the latter were much greater, le&s;t her Spoons and Tan|kards &s;hould be upon the March, without having received any &s;uch Orders from her.</P>
<P>Our poor Centinel, to whom the Sight of this Officer was not much more welcome than the Ap|parition, as he thought it, which he had &s;een before, again related the dreadful Story, and with many Ad|ditions of Blood and Fire: But he had the Misfortune to gain no Credit with either of the la&s;t mentioned Per&s;ons; for the Officer, tho' a very religious Man, was free from all Terrors of this Kind; be&s;ides, having &s;o lately left <HI>Jones</HI> in the Condition we have &s;een, he had no Su&s;picion of his being dead. As for the Landlady, tho' not over religious, &s;he had no kind of Aver&s;ion to the Doctrine of Spirits; but
<PB N="79" REF="88">
there was a Circum&s;tance in the Tale which &s;he well knew to be fal&s;e, as we &s;hall inform the Reader pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>But whether <HI>Northerton</HI> was carried away in Thunder or Fire, or in whatever other Manner he was gone; it was now certain, that his Body was no longer in Cu&s;tody. Upon this Occa&s;ion, the Lieu|tenant formed a Conclu&s;ion not very different from what the Serjeant is ju&s;t mentioned to have made be|fore, and immediately ordered the Centinel to be ta|ken Pri&s;oner. So that, by a &s;trange Rever&s;e of For|tune (tho' not very uncommon in a military Life) the Guard became the Guarded.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. <HI>The Conclu&s;ion of the foregoing Adventure.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BESIDES the Su&s;picion of Sleep, the Lieutenant harboured another, and wor&s;e Doubt again&s;t the poor Centinel, and this was that of Treachery: For as he believed not one Syllable of the Apparition, &s;o he imagined the whole to be an Invention, formed only to impo&s;e upon him, and that the Fellow had, in Reality, been bribed by <HI>Northerton</HI> to let him e&s;cape. And this he imagined the rather, as the Fright ap|peared to him, the more unnatural in one who had the Character of as brave and bold a Man as any in the Regiment, having been in &s;everal Ac|tions, having received &s;everal Wounds, and in a Word, having behaved him&s;elf always like a good and valiant Soldier.</P>
<P>That the Reader, therefore, may not conceive the lea&s;t ill Opinion of &s;uch a Per&s;on, we &s;hall not delay a Moment in re&s;cuing his Character from the Imputa|tion of this Guilt.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Northerton</HI> then, as we have before ob&s;erved, was fully &s;atisfied with the Glory which he had ob|tained
<PB N="80" REF="89">
from this Action. He had, perhaps, &s;een, or heard, or gue&s;&s;ed, that Envy is apt to attend Fame. Not that I would here in&s;inuate, that he was hea|theni&s;hly inclined to believe in, or to wor&s;hip, the Godde&s;s <HI>Neme&s;is;</HI> for, in fact, I am convinced he never heard of her Name. He was, be&s;ides, of an Active Di&s;po&s;ition, and had a great Antipathy to tho&s;e clo&s;e Winter Quarters in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> for which a Ju&s;tice of Peace might po&s;&s;ibly give him a Billet. Nor was he moreover free from &s;ome un|ea&s;y Meditations on a certain wooden Edifice, which I forbear to name, in Conformity to the Opinion of Mankind, who, I think, rather ought to honour than to be a&s;hamed of this Building, as it is, or at lea&s;t might be made, of more Benefit to Society than almo&s;t any other public Erection. In a Word, to hint at no more Rea&s;ons for his Conduct, Mr. <HI>Northerton</HI> was de&s;irous of departing that Evening, and nothing re|mained for him but to contrive the <HI>Quomodo,</HI> which appeared to be a Matter of &s;ome Difficulty.</P>
<P>Now this young Gentleman, tho' &s;omewhat crook|ed in his Morals, was perfectly &s;trait in his Per&s;on, which was extremely &s;trong and well made. His Face too was accounted hand&s;ome by the Generality of Women, for it was broad and ruddy, with to|lerably good Teeth. Such Charms did not fail mak|ing an Impre&s;&s;ion on my Landlady, who had no little Reli&s;h for this kind of Beauty. She had, indeed, a real Compa&s;&s;ion for the young Man; and hearing from the Surgeon that Affairs were like to go ill with the Volunteer, &s;he &s;u&s;pected they might hereafter wear no benign A&s;pect with the En&s;ign. Having ob|tained, therefore, leave to make him a Vi&s;it, and finding him in a very melancholy Mood, which &s;he con&s;iderably heightened, by telling him there were &s;carce any Hopes of the Volunteer's Life, &s;he pro|ceeded to throw forth &s;ome Hints, which the other
<PB N="81" REF="90">
readily and eagerly taking up, they &s;oon came to a right Under&s;tanding; and it was at length agreed, that the En&s;ign &s;hould at a certain Signal a&s;cend the Chim|ney, which communicating very &s;oon with that of the Kitchen, he might there again let him&s;elf down; for which &s;he would give him an Opportunity, by keep|ing the Coa&s;t clear.</P>
<P>But le&s;t our Readers, of a different Complexion, &s;hould take this Occa&s;ion of too ha&s;tily condemning all Compa&s;&s;ion as a Folly, and pernicious to Society, we think proper to mention another Particular, which might po&s;&s;ibly have &s;ome little Share in this Action. The En&s;ign happened to be at this Time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Sum of fifty Pounds, which did indeed belong to the whole Company: For the Captain having quar|relled with his Lieutenant, had entru&s;ted the Pay|ment of his Company to the En&s;ign. This Money, however, he thought proper to depo&s;ite in my Land|lady's Hand, po&s;&s;ibly by way of Bail or Security that he would hereafter appear and an&s;wer to the Charge again&s;t him; but whatever were the Conditions, cer|tain it is, that &s;he had the Money, and the En&s;ign his Liberty.</P>
<P>The Reader may, perhaps, expect, from the com|pa&s;&s;ionate Temper of this good Woman, that when &s;he &s;aw the poor Centinel taken Pri&s;oner for a Fact of which &s;he knew him innocent, that &s;he &s;hould imme|diately have interpo&s;ed in his Behalf; but whether it was that &s;he had already exhau&s;ted all her Compa&s;&s;ion in the above-mentioned In&s;tance, or that the Features of this Fellow, tho' not very different from tho&s;e of the En&s;ign, could not rai&s;e it, I will not determine; but &s;o far from being an Advocate for the pre&s;ent Pri|&s;oner, &s;he urged his Guilt to his Officer, declaring with uplifted Eyes and Hands, that &s;he would not have had any Concern in the E&s;cape of a Murderer for all the World.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="91">
Every thing was now once more quiet; and mo&s;t of the Company returned again to their Beds; but the Landlady, either from the natural Activity of her Di&s;po&s;ition, or from her Fear for her Plate, having no Propen&s;ity to &s;leep, prevailed with the Officers, as they were to march within little more than an Hour, to &s;pend that Time with her over a Bowl of Punch.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> had lain awake all this while, and had heard great Part of the Hurry and Bu&s;tle that had pa&s;&s;ed, of which he had now &s;ome Curio&s;ity to know the Particulars. He therefore applied to his Bell, which he rung at lea&s;t twenty Times without any Effect; for my Landlady was in &s;uch high Mirth with her Company, that no Clapper could be heard there but her own, and the Drawer and Chambermaid, who were &s;itting together in the Kitchen (for nei|ther dur&s;t he &s;it up, nor &s;he lie in Bed alone) the more they heard the Bell ring, the more they were frightened, and, as it were, nailed down in their Places.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, at a lucky Interval of Chat, the Sound reached the Ears of our good Landlady, who pre|&s;ently &s;ent forth her Summons, which both her Ser|vants in&s;tantly obeyed. <Q REND="inline"><HI>'Joo,'</HI> &s;ays the Mi&s;tre&s;s, 'don't you hear the Gentleman's Bell ring? why don't you go up?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'It is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s,' an|&s;wered the Drawer, 'to wait upon the Chambers. It is <HI>Betty</HI> Chambermaid's!'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'If you come to that,' an&s;wered the Maid, 'it is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s to wait upon Gentlemen. I have done it, indeed, &s;ome times; but the Devil fetch me if ever I do again, &s;ince you make your Preambles about it.'</Q> The Bell &s;till ringing violently, their Mi&s;tre&s;s fell into a Pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;wore, if the Drawer did not go up im|mediately, &s;he would turn him away that very Morn|ing. <Q REND="inline">'If you do, Madam,' &s;ays he, 'I can't help
<PB N="83" REF="92">
it. I won't do another Servant's Bu&s;ine&s;s.'</Q> She then applied her&s;elf to the Maid, and endeavoured to prevail by gentle Means; but all in vain, <HI>Betty</HI> was as inflexible as <HI>Joo.</HI> Both in&s;i&s;ted it was not their Bu|&s;ine&s;s, and they would not do it.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant then fell a laughing, and &s;aid, 'Come, I will put an End to this Contention;' and then turning to the Servants, commended them for their Re&s;olution, in neither giving up the Point; but added, he was &s;ure, if one would con&s;ent to go, the other would. To which Propo&s;al they both a|greed in an In&s;tant, and accordingly went up very lovingly and clo&s;e together. When they were gone, the Lieutenant appea&s;ed the Wrath of the Landlady, by &s;atisfying her why they were both &s;o unwilling to go alone.</P>
<P>They returned &s;oon after, and acquainted their Mi&s;tre&s;s, that the &s;ick Gentleman was &s;o far from be|ing dead, that he &s;poke as heartily as if he was well; and that he gave his Service to the Captain, and &s;hould be very glad of the Favour of &s;eeing him before he marched.</P>
<P>The good Lieutenant immediately complied with his De&s;ires, and &s;itting down by his Bed-&s;ide acquaint|ed him with the Scene which had happened below, concluding with his Intentions to make an Example of the Centinel.</P>
<P>Upon this, <HI>Jones</HI> related to him the whole Truth, and earne&s;tly begged him not to puni&s;h the poor Sol|dier, <Q REND="inline">'who, I am confident,' &s;ays he, 'is as in|nocent of the En&s;ign's E&s;cape, as he is of forging any Lie, or of endeavouring to impo&s;e on you.'</Q></P>
<P>The Lieutenant he&s;itated a few Moments, and then an&s;wered: <Q REND="inline">'Why, as you have cleared the Fellow of one Part of the Charge, &s;o it will be impo&s;&s;ible to prove the other; becau&s;e he was not the only Cen|tinel. But I have a good mind to puni&s;h the Ra&s;|cal
<PB N="84" REF="93">
for being a Coward. Yet who knows what Effect the Terror of &s;uch an Apprehen&s;ion may have; and to &s;ay the Truth, he hath always be|haved well again&s;t an Enemy. Come, it is a good Thing to &s;ee any Sign of Religion in the&s;e Fellows; &s;o I promi&s;e you he &s;hall be &s;et at liberty when we march. But hark, the General beats. My dear Boy, give me another Bu&s;s. Don't di&s;compo&s;e nor hurry your&s;elf; but remember the Chri&s;tian Doc|trine of Patience, and I warrant you will &s;oon be able to do your&s;elf Ju&s;tice, and take to an honourable Revenge on the Fellow who hath injured you.'</Q> The Lieutenant then departed, and <HI>Jones</HI> endeavoured to compo&s;e him&s;elf to Re&s;t.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>A wonderful long Chapter concerning the Marvellous; being much the longe&s;t of all our introductory Chapters.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS we are now entering upon a Book, in which the Cour&s;e of our Hi&s;tory will oblige us to relate &s;ome Matters of a more &s;trange and &s;urprizing Kind than any which have hitherto occur|red, it may not be ami&s;s in the prolegomenous, or introductory Chapter, to &s;ay &s;omething of that Spe|cies of Writing which is called the Marvellous. To this we &s;hall, as well for the Sake of our&s;elves, as of others, endeavour to &s;et &s;ome certain Bounds; and indeed nothing can be more nece&s;&s;ary, as Criticks <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By this Word here, and in mo&s;t other Parts of our Work, we mean every Reader in the World.</NOTE>
<PB N="86" REF="95">
of different Complexions are here apt to run into very different Extremes; for while &s;ome are, with M. <HI>Dacier,</HI> ready to allow, that the &s;ame Thing which is impo&s;&s;ible may be yet probable <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is happy for M. <HI>Dacier</HI> that he was not an <HI>Iri&s;h|man.</HI></NOTE>, others have &s;o little Hi&s;toric or Poetic Faith, that they believe no|thing to be either po&s;&s;ible or probable, the like to which hath not occured to their own Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, I think, it may very rea&s;onably be re|quired of every Writer, that he keeps within the Bounds of Po&s;&s;ibility; and &s;till remembers that what it is not po&s;&s;ible for Man to perform, it is &s;carce po&s;|&s;ible for Man to believe he did perform. This Convic|tion, perhaps, gave Birth to many Stories of the an|tient Heathen Deities (for mo&s;t of them are of poeti|cal Original). The Poet, being de&s;irous to indulge a wanton and extravagant Imagination, took Refuge in that Power, of the Extent of which his Readers were no Judges, or rather which they imagined to be infi|nite, and con&s;equently they could not be &s;hocked at any Prodigies related of it. This hath been &s;trongly urged in Defence of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Miracles; and it is, per|haps, a Defence; not, as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> would have it, becau&s;e <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> told a &s;et of fooli&s;h Lies to the <HI>Phae|acians,</HI> who were a very dull Nation; but becau&s;e the Poet him&s;elf wrote to Heathens, to whom poeti|cal Fables were Articles of Faith. For my own Part, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, &s;o compa&s;&s;ionate is my Tem|per, I wi&s;h <HI>Polypheme</HI> had confined him&s;elf to his Milk Diet, and pre&s;erved his Eye; nor could <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> be much more concerned than my&s;elf, when his Com|panions were turned into Swine by <HI>Circe,</HI> who &s;hew|ed, I think, afterwards, too much Regard for Man's Fle&s;h to be &s;uppo&s;ed capable of converting it into Ba|con. I wi&s;h, likewi&s;e, with all my Heart, that <HI>Ho|mer</HI> could have known the Rule pre&s;cribed by <HI>Horace,</HI>
<PB N="87" REF="96">
to introduce &s;upernatural Agents as &s;eldom as po&s;&s;ible. We &s;hould not then have &s;een his Gods coming on trivial Errands, and often behaving them&s;elves &s;o as not only to forfeit all Title to Re&s;pect, but to become the Objects of Scorn and Deri&s;ion. A Conduct which mu&s;t have &s;hocked the Credulity of a pious and &s;aga|cious Heathen; and which could never have been de|fended, unle&s;s by agreeing with a Suppo&s;ition to which I have been &s;ometimes almo&s;t inclined, that this mo&s;t glorious Poet, as he certainly was, had an Intent to bur|le&s;que the &s;uper&s;tious Faith of his own Age and Country.</P>
<P>But I have re&s;ted too long on a Doctrine which can be of no U&s;e to a Chri&s;tian Writer: For as he cannot introduce into his Works any of that heaven|ly Ho&s;t which make a Part of his Creed; &s;o is it horrid Puerility to &s;earch the Heathen Theology for any of tho&s;e Deities who have been long &s;ince de|throned from their Immortality. Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> ob&s;erves, that nothing is more cold than the Invoca|tion of a Mu&s;e by a Modern; he might have added that nothing can be more ab&s;urd. A modern may with much more Elegance invoke a Ballad, as &s;ome have thought <HI>Homer</HI> did, or a Mug of Ale with the Author of <HI>Hudibras;</HI> which latter may perhaps have in&s;pired much more Poetry as well as Pro&s;e, than all the Liquors of <HI>Hippocrene</HI> or <HI>Helicon.</HI></P>
<P>The only &s;upernatural Agents which can in any Manner be allowed to us Moderns are Gho&s;ts; but of the&s;e I would advi&s;e an Author to be extremely &s;paring. The&s;e are indeed like Ar&s;enic, and other dangerous Drugs in Phy&s;ic, to be u&s;ed with the ut|mo&s;t Caution; nor would I advi&s;e the Introduction of them at all in tho&s;e Works, or by tho&s;e Authors to which, or to whom a Hor&s;e-Laugh in the Reader, would be any great Prejudice or Mortification.</P>
<P>As for Elves and Fairies, and other &s;uch Mum|mery, I purpo&s;ely omit the Mention of them, as I
<PB N="88" REF="97">
&s;hould be very unwilling to confine within any Bounds tho&s;e &s;urprizing Imaginations, for who&s;e Capacity the Limits of human Nature are too narrow; who&s;e Works are to be con&s;idered as a new Creation; and who have con&s;equently ju&s;t Right to do what they will with their own.</P>
<P>Man therefore is the highe&s;t Subject (unle&s;s on very extraordinary Occa&s;ions indeed) which pre&s;ents it&s;elf to the Pen of our Hi&s;torian, or of our Poet; and in relating his Actions, great Care is to be taken, that we do not exceed the Capacity of the Agent we de|&s;cribe.</P>
<P>Nor is Po&s;&s;ibility alone &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify us, we mu&s;t keep likewi&s;e within the Rules of Probability. It is, I think, the Opinion of <HI>Ari&s;totle;</HI> or if not, it is the Opinion of &s;ome wi&s;e Man, who&s;e Authority will be as weighty, when it is as old; 'that it is no Excu&s;e for a Poet who relates what is incredible, that the thing related is really Matter of Fact.' This may perhaps be allowed true with regard to Poetry, but it may be thought impracticable to extend it to the Hi&s;torian: For he is obliged to record Matters as he finds them; though they may be of &s;o extraordinary a Nature, as will require no &s;mall Degree of hi&s;tori|cal Faith to &s;wallow them. Such was the &s;ucce&s;sle&s;s Armament of <HI>Xerxes,</HI> de&s;cribed by <HI>Herodotus,</HI> or the &s;ucce&s;sful Expedition of <HI>Alexander</HI> related by <HI>Arrian.</HI> Such of later Years was the Victory of <HI>Agincourt</HI> obtained by <HI>Harry</HI> the Fifth, or that of <HI>Narva,</HI> won by <HI>Charles</HI> the Twelfth of <HI>Sweden.</HI> All which In|&s;tances, the more we reflect on them, appear &s;till the more a&s;toni&s;hing.</P>
<P>Such Facts, however, as they occur in the Thread of the Story; nay, indeed, as they con&s;titute the e&s;|&s;ential Parts of it, the Hi&s;torian is not only ju&s;tifiable in recording as they really happened; but indeed would be unpardonable, &s;hould he omit or alter them.

But there are other Facts not of &s;uch Con&s;equence nor &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, which tho' ever &s;o well atte&s;ted, may neverthele&s;s be &s;acrificed to Oblivion in Complai&s;ance to the Sceptici&s;m of a Reader. Such is that memo|rable Story of the Gho&s;t of <HI>George Villers,</HI> which might with more Propriety have been made a Pre&s;ent of to Dr. <HI>Drelincourt,</HI> to have kept the Gho&s;t of Mrs. <HI>Veale</HI> Company, at the Head of his Di&s;cour&s;e upon Death, than have been introduced into &s;o &s;o|lemn a Work as the Hi&s;tory of the Rebellion.</P>
<P>To &s;ay the Truth, if the Hi&s;torian will confine him&s;elf to what really happened, and utterly reject any Circum&s;tance, which, tho' never &s;o well atte&s;t|ed, he mu&s;t be well a&s;&s;ured is fal&s;e, he will &s;ometimes fall into the Marvellous, but never into the Incredi|ble. He will often rai&s;e the Wonder and Surprize of his Reader, but never that incredulous Hatred men|tioned by <HI>Horace.</HI> It is by falling into Fiction there|fore, that we generally offend again&s;t this Rule, of de&s;erting Probability, which the Hi&s;torian &s;eldom if ever quits, till he for&s;akes his Character, and com|mences a Writer of Romance. In this, however, tho&s;e Hi&s;torians who relate public Tran&s;actions, have the Advantage of us who confine our&s;elves to Scenes of private Life. The Credit of the former is by common Notoriety &s;upported for a long Time; and public Records, with the concurrent Te&s;timony of many Authors bear Evidence to their Truth in fu|ture Ages. Thus a <HI>Trajan</HI> and an <HI>Antoninus,</HI> a <HI>Nero</HI> and a <HI>Caligula,</HI> have all met with the Belief of Po|&s;terity; and no one doubts but that Men &s;o very good, and &s;o very bad, were once the Ma&s;ters of Mankind.</P>
<P>But we who deal in private Characters, who &s;earch into the mo&s;t retired Rece&s;&s;es, and draw forth Exam|ples of Virtue and Vice, from Holes and Corners of the World, are in a more dangerous Situation. As'
<PB N="90" REF="99">
we have no publick Notoriety, no concurrent Te&s;ti|mony, no Records to &s;upport and corroborate what we deliver, it becomes us not only to keep within the Limits of Po&s;&s;ibility, but of Probability too; and this more e&s;pecially in painting what is greatly good and amiable. Knavery and Folly, though never &s;o exor|bitant, will more ea&s;ily meet with A&s;&s;ent: for Ill|nature adds great Support and Strength to Faith.</P>
<P>Thus we may, perhaps, with little Danger relate the Hi&s;tory of a <HI>Fi&s;her;</HI> who having long owed his Bread to the Genero&s;ity of Mr. <HI>Derby,</HI> and having that very Morning received a con&s;iderable Bounty from his Hands, in order to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of what remained in his Friend's Scrutore, concealed him&s;elf in a public Office of the Temple, through which there was a Pa&s;&s;age into Mr. <HI>Derby</HI>'s Chambers. Here he overheard Mr. <HI>Derby</HI> for many Hours &s;ola|cing him&s;elf at an Entertainment which he that Even|ing gave his Friends, and to which <HI>Fi&s;her</HI> had been invited. During all this Time, no tender, no grate|ful Reflections aro&s;e to re&s;train his Purpo&s;e; but when the poor Gentleman had let his Company out through the Office, <HI>Fi&s;her</HI> came &s;uddenly from his lurking Place, and walking &s;oftly behind his Friend into his Chamber, di&s;charged a Pi&s;tol Ball into his Head. This may be believed, when the Bones of <HI>Fi&s;her</HI> are as rot|ten as his Heart. Nay, perhaps, it will be credited that the Villain went two Days afterwards with &s;ome young Ladies to the Play of <HI>Hamlet;</HI> and with an unaltered Countenance heard one of the Ladies, who little &s;u&s;pected how near &s;he was to the Per&s;on, cry out, Good God! if the Man that murdered Mr. <HI>Der|by</HI> was now pre&s;ent! Manife&s;ting in this a more &s;ear|ed and callous Con&s;cience than even <HI>Nero</HI> him&s;elf; of whom we are told by <HI>Suetonius,</HI> <Q REND="inline">'that the Con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s of his Guilt after the Death of his Mother became immediately intolerable, and &s;o continued;
<PB N="91" REF="100">
nor could all the Congratulations of the Soldiers, of the Senate, and the People, allay the Horrors of his Con&s;cience.'</Q></P>
<P>But now, on the other hand, &s;hould I tell my Reader, that I had known a Man who&s;e penetrating Genius had enabled him to rai&s;e a large Fortune in a Way where no Beginning was chaulked out to him: That he had done this with the mo&s;t perfect Pre&s;er|vation of his Integrity, and not only without the lea&s;t Inju&s;tice or Injury to any one individual Per&s;on, but with the highe&s;t Advantage to Trade, and a va&s;t Increa&s;e of the public Revenue: That he had expend|ed one Part of the Income of this Fortune in di&s;co|vering a Ta&s;te &s;uperior to mo&s;t, by Works where the highe&s;t Dignity was united with the pure&s;t Sim|plicity, and another Part in di&s;playing a Degree of Goodne&s;s &s;uperior to all Men, by acts of Charity to Objects who&s;e only Recommendations were their Merits, or their Wants: That he was mo&s;t indu&s;tri|ous in &s;earching after Merit in Di&s;tre&s;s, mo&s;t eager to relieve it, and then as careful (perhaps too careful) to conceal what he had done: That his Hou&s;e, his Furniture, his Gardens, his Table, his private Ho&s;|pitality, and his public Beneficence all denoted the Mind from which they flowed, and were all intrin|&s;ically rich and noble, without Tin&s;el, or external O&s;tentation: That he filled every Relation in Life with the mo&s;t adequate Virtue: That he was mo&s;t piou&s;ly religious to his Creator, mo&s;t zealou&s;ly loyal to his Sovereign; a mo&s;t tender Hu&s;band to his Wife, a kind Relation, a munificent Patron, a warm and firm Friend, a knowing and a chearful Companion, indulgent to his Servants, ho&s;pitable to his Neigh|bours, charitable to the Poor, and benevolent to all Mankind. Should I add to the&s;e the Epithits of wi&s;e, brave, elegant, and indeed every other amia|ble Epithet in our Language, I might &s;urely &s;ay,</P>

<P>And yet I know a Man who is all I have here de|&s;cribed. But a &s;ingle In&s;tance (and I really know not &s;uch another) is not &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify us, while we are writing to thou&s;ands who never heard of the Per&s;on, nor of any thing like him. Such <HI>Rarae A|ves</HI> &s;hould be remitted to the Epitaph-Writer, or to &s;ome Poet, who may conde&s;cend to hitch him in a Di&s;tich, or to &s;lide him into a Rhime with an Air of Carele&s;ne&s;s and Neglect, without giving any Offence to the Reader.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t Place, the Actions &s;hould be &s;uch as may not only be within the Compa&s;s of human Agency, and which human Agents may probably be &s;uppo&s;ed to do; but they &s;hould be likely for the very Actors and Characters them&s;elves to have performed: For what may be only wonderful and &s;urprizing in one Man, may become improbable, or indeed impo&s;&s;ible, when related of another.</P>
<P>This la&s;t Requi&s;ite is what the dramatic Critics call Con&s;ervation of Character, and it requires a very ex|traordinary Degree of Judgment, and a mo&s;t exact Knowledge of human Nature.</P>
<P>It is admirably remarked by a mo&s;t excellent Wri|ter, That Zeal can no more hurry a Man to act in direct Oppo&s;ition to it&s;elf, than a rapid Stream can carry a Boat again&s;t its own Current. I will venture to &s;ay, that for a Man to act in direct Contradiction to the Dictates of Nature, is, if not impo&s;&s;ible, as improbable and as miraculous as any Thing which can well be conceived. Should the be&s;t Parts of the Story of <HI>M. Antoninus</HI> be a&s;cribed to <HI>Nero,</HI> or &s;hould the wor&s;t Incidents of <HI>Nero</HI>'s Life be imputed to <HI>An|toninus,</HI> what would be more &s;hocking to Belief than either In&s;tance; whereas both the&s;e being related of their proper Agent, con&s;titute the Truly Marvellous.</P>

Our modern Authors of Comedy have fallen al|mo&s;t univer&s;ally into the Error here hinted at: Their Heroes generally are notorious Rogues, and their Heroines abandoned Jades, during the fir&s;t four Acts; but in the fifth, the former become very worthy Gentlemen, and the latter, Women of Virtue and Di&s;cretion: Nor is the Writer often &s;o kind as to give him&s;elf the lea&s;t Trouble, to reconcile or account for this mon&s;trous Change and Incongruity. There is, indeed, no other Rea&s;on to be a&s;&s;igned for it, than becau&s;e the Play is drawing to a Conclu&s;ion; as if it was no le&s;s natural in a Rogue to repent in the la&s;t Act of a Play, than in the la&s;t of his Life; which we perceive to be generally the Ca&s;e at <HI>Tyburn,</HI> a Place which might, indeed, clo&s;e the Scene of &s;ome Co|medies with much Propriety, as the Heroes in the&s;e are mo&s;t commonly eminent for tho&s;e very Talents which not only bring Men to the Gallows, but enable them to make an heroic Figure when they are there.</P>
<P>Within the&s;e few Re&s;trictions, I think, every Wri|ter may be permitted to deal as much in the Wonder|ful as he plea&s;es; nay, the more he can &s;urpri&s;e the Reader, if he thus keeps within the Rules of Credi|bility, the more he will engage his Attention, and the more he will charm him.

<P>For though every good Author will confine him|&s;elf within the Bounds of Probability, it is by no means nece&s;&s;ary that his Characters, or his Incidents, &s;hould be trite, common, or vulgar; &s;uch as happen in every Street, or in every Hou&s;e, or which may be met with in the home Articles of a News-paper.

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>In which the Landlady pays a Vi&s;it to Mr.</HI> Jones.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN <HI>Jones</HI> had taken Leave of his Friend the Lieutenant, he endeavoured to clo&s;e his Eyes, but all in vain; his Spirits were too lively and wake|ful to be lulled to Sleep. So having amu&s;ed, or rather tormented him&s;elf with the Thoughts of his <HI>Sophia,</HI> till it was open Day-light, he called for &s;ome Tea; upon which Occa&s;ion my Landlady her&s;elf vouch&s;af|ed to pay him a Vi&s;it.</P>
<P>This was indeed the fir&s;t Time &s;he had &s;een him, or at lea&s;t had taken any Notice of him; but as the Lieutenant had a&s;&s;ured her that he was certainly &s;ome young Gentleman of Fa&s;hion, &s;he now determined to &s;hew him all the Re&s;pect in her Power: for, to &s;peak truly, this was one of tho&s;e Hou&s;es where Gentle|men, to u&s;e the Language of Adverti&s;ements, meet with civil Treatment for their Money.</P>
<P>She had no &s;ooner begun to make his Tea, than &s;he likewi&s;e began to di&s;cour&s;e, <Q REND="inline">'La!

<P>BEFORE we proceed any farther, that the Rea|der may not be mi&s;taken in imagining the Land|lady knew more than &s;he did, nor &s;urprized that &s;he knew &s;o much, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to inform him, that the Lieutenant had acquainted her that the Name of <HI>Sophia</HI> had been the Occa&s;ion of the Quarrel; and as for the re&s;t of her Knowledge, the &s;agacious Rea|der will ob&s;erve how &s;he came by it in the preceding Scene.

<P>She was no &s;ooner gone, than <HI>Jones,</HI> in&s;tead of animadverting on her Behaviour, reflected that he was in the &s;ame Bed, which he was informed had held his dear <HI>Sophia.</HI> This occa&s;ioned a thou&s;and fond and tender Thoughts, which we would dwell longer upon, did we not con&s;ider that &s;uch kind of Lovers will make a very incon&s;iderable Part of our Readers.</P>
<P>In this Situation the Surgeon found him, when he came to dre&s;s his Wound. The Doctor, per|ceiving upon Examination, that his Pul&s;e was di&s;or|dered, and hearing that he had not &s;lept, declared that he was in great Danger: For he apprehended a Fever was coming on; which he would have pre|vented by bleeding, but <HI>Jones</HI> would not &s;ubmit, de|claring he would lo&s;e no more Blood; and <Q REND="inline">'Doc|tor,' &s;ays he, 'if you will be &s;o kind only to dre&s;s my Head, I have no Doubt of being well in a Day or two.'</Q></P>

<P>The Doctor retired into the Kitchen, where, ad|dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Landlady, he complained bit|terly of the undutiful Behaviour of his Patient, who would not be blooded, though he was in a Fever.</P>

<P>THE Clock had now &s;truck Five, when <HI>Jones</HI> awaked from a Nap of &s;even Hours, &s;o much refre&s;hed, and in &s;uch perfect Health and Spirits,

<P>Meeting the Landlady, he acco&s;ted her with great Civility, and a&s;ked <Q REND="inline">'what he could have for Dinner.'</Q> <Q REND="inline"> 'For Dinner! &s;ays &s;he, 'it is an odd Time a Day to think of Dinner.

<P><HI>Jones</HI> now returned in order to dre&s;s him&s;elf, while his Dinner was preparing, and was, according to his Orders, attended by the Barber.</P>
<P>This Barber, who went by the Name of little <HI>Ben|jamin,</HI> was a Fellow of great Oddity and Humour, which had frequently led him into &s;mall Inconvenien|cies, &s;uch as Slaps in the Face, Kicks in the Breech, broken Bones, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For every one doth not under&s;tand a Je&s;t; and tho&s;e who do, are often di&s;plea&s;ed with being them&s;elves the Subjects of it.

<PB N="103" REF="112">
was certain to be delivered of it, without the lea&s;t Re|&s;pect of Per&s;ons, Time, or Place.</P>
<P>He had a great many other Particularities in his Character, which I &s;hall not mention, as the Rea|der him&s;elf will very ea&s;ily perceive them, on his far|ther Acquaintance with this extraordinary Per&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> being impatient to be dre&s;t, for a Rea&s;on which may be ea&s;ily imagined, thought the Shaver was very tedious in preparing his Suds, and begged him to make Ha&s;te; to which the other an&s;wered, with Gravity: For he never di&s;compo&s;ed his Mu&s;cles on any Account. <Q REND="inline"><HI>'Fe&s;tina lent&egrave;</HI> is a Proverb which I learnt long before I ever touched a Razor.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I find, Friend, you are a Scholar,' replied <HI>Jones,</HI></Q> <Q REND="inline">'A poor one,' &s;aid the Barber, <HI>'non omnia po&s;&s;umus omnes.</HI></Q> <Q REND="inline"> Again!' &s;aid <HI>Jones;</HI> 'I fancy you are good at capping Ver&s;es.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">Excu&s;e me Sir,' &s;aid the Barber, <HI>'non tanti me dignor honore.'</HI></Q> And then pro|ceeding to his Operation, <Q REND="inline">'Sir,' &s;aid he, '&s;ince I have dealt in Suds, I could never di&s;cover more than two Rea&s;ons for &s;having, the one is to get a Beard, and the other to get rid of one.

<P><Q REND="inline">'O dear Sir,' &s;aid the Barber, 'I can do you twenty times as great a Favour, if you will accept of it.' 'What is that, my Friend,' cries <HI>Jones.</HI> 'Why, I will drink a Bottle with you, if you plea&s;e; for I dearly love Good-nature, and as you have found me out to be a comical Fellow, &s;o I have no Skill in Phy&s;iognomy, if you are not one of the be&s;t|natured Gentlemen in the Univer&s;e.'</Q> <HI>Jones</HI> now walked down Stairs neatly dre&s;t, and perhaps the famed <HI>Adonis</HI> was not a lovelier Figure; and yet he had no Charms for my Landlady: For as that good Wo|man did not re&s;emble <HI>Venus</HI> at all in her Per&s;on, &s;o neither did &s;he in her Ta&s;te.

This <HI>Nancy</HI> was extremely pretty, and altogether as coy; for &s;he had refu&s;ed a Drawer, and one or two young Farmers in the Neighbourhood, but the bright Eyes of our Heroe thawed all her Ice in a Moment.</P>
<P>When <HI>Jones</HI> returned to the Kitchen, his Cloth was not yet laid; nor indeed was there any Occa&s;ion
<PB N="105" REF="114">
it &s;hould, his Dinner remaining in <HI>Satu quo,</HI> as did the Fire which was to dre&s;s it.

<P>This Sun, into which <HI>Jones</HI> was now conducted, was truly named as <HI>Lucus a non lucendo;</HI> for it was an Apartment into which the Sun had &s;carce ever looked.

<P>THIS Conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed partly while <HI>Jones</HI> was at Dinner in his Dungeon, and partly while he was expecting the Barber in the Parlour. And, as &s;oon as it was ended, Mr. <HI>Benjamin,</HI> as we have &s;aid, attended him, and was very kindly de&s;ired to &s;it down. <HI>Jones</HI> then filling out a Gla&s;s of Wine, drank his Health by the Appellation of <HI>Docti&s;&s;ime Ton&s;orum. Ago tibi Gratias, Domine,</HI> &s;aid the Bar|ber, and then looking very &s;tedfa&s;tly at <HI>Jones,</HI> he &s;aid, with great Gravity, and with a &s;eeming Surprize, as if he recollected a Face he had &s;een before, <Q REND="inline">'Sir, may I crave the Favour to know if your Name is not <HI>Jones?'</HI></Q> To which the other an&s;wered, That it was. <Q REND="inline"><HI>'Proh Deum at&abque; Hominum Fidem,'</HI> &s;ays the Barber, 'how &s;trangely Things come to pa&s;s.

I am &s;ure it moved me to hear the Story, and I hope it is all fal&s;e; for I have a great Re&s;pect for you, I do a&s;&s;ure you I have, and have had, ever &s;ince the Good-nature you &s;hewed to <HI>Black George,</HI> which was talked of all over the Country, and I received more than one Letter about it. Indeed it made you beloved by every body. You will pardon me, therefore; for it was real Concern at what I heard made me a&s;k any Que&s;tions; for I have no impertinent Curio&s;ity about me; but I love Good-nature, and thence became <HI>Amoris abundantia ergo Te.'</HI></Q></P>
<P>Every Profe&s;&s;ion of Friend&s;hip ea&s;ily gains Credit with the Mi&s;erable, it is no wonder, therefore, if <HI>Jones,</HI> who, be&s;ides his being mi&s;erable, was extreme|ly open-hearted, very readily believed all the Profe&s;|&s;ions of <HI>Benjamin,</HI> and received him into his Bo&s;om. The Scraps of <HI>Latin,</HI> &s;ome of which <HI>Benjamin</HI> ap|plied properly enough, though it did not favour of profound Literature, &s;eemed yet to indicate &s;ome|thing &s;uperior to a common Barber, and &s;o indeed did his whole Behaviour. <HI>Jones</HI> therefore believed the Truth of what he &s;aid, as to his Original and Education, and at length, after much Entreaty, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'Since you have heard, my Friend, &s;o much of my Affairs, and &s;eem &s;o de&s;irous to know the
<PB N="109" REF="118">

<P><HI>Jones</HI> now began, and related the whole Hi&s;tory, forgetting only a Circum&s;tance or two, namely, e|very thing which pa&s;&s;ed on that Day in which he had fought with <HI>Thwackum,</HI> and ended with his Re|&s;olution to go to Sea, till the Rebellion in the North had made him change his Purpo&s;e, and had brought him to the Place where he then was.</P>
<P>Little <HI>Benjamin,</HI> who had been all Attention, never once interrupted the Narrative; but when it was ended, he could not help ob&s;erving, that there mu&s;t be &s;urely &s;omething more invented by his Enemies, and told Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> again&s;t him, or &s;o good a Man would never have di&s;mi&s;&s;ed one he had loved &s;o tenderly, in &s;uch a Manner. To which <HI>Jones</HI> an|&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">'He doubted not but &s;uch villanous Arts had been made u&s;e of to de&s;troy him.'</Q></P>
<P>And &s;urely it was &s;carce po&s;&s;ible for any one to have avoided making the &s;ame Remark with the Bar|ber; who had not, indeed, heard from <HI>Jones</HI> one &s;ingle Circum&s;tance upon which he was condemned; for his Actions were not now placed in tho&s;e injurious Lights, in which they had been mi&s;repre&s;ented to <HI>Allworthy:</HI> Nor could he mention tho&s;e many fal&s;e Accu&s;ations which had been from time to time pre|ferred again&s;t him to <HI>Allworthy;</HI> for with none of the&s;e was he him&s;elf acquainted. He had likewi&s;e, as we have ob&s;erved, omitted many material Facts in his pre&s;ent Relation. Upon the whole, indeed, every thing now appeared in &s;uch favourable Colours to <HI>Jones,</HI> that Malice it &s;elf would have found it no ea&s;y Matter to fix any Blame upon him.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="119">
Not that <HI>Jones</HI> de&s;ired to conceal or to di&s;gui&s;e the Truth; nay, he would have been more unwilling to have &s;uffered any Cen&s;ure to fall on Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> for puni&s;hing him, than on his own Actions for de|&s;erving it; but, in Reality, &s;o it happened, and &s;o it always will happen: For let a Man be never &s;o hone&s;t, the Account of his own Conduct will, in Spite of him&s;elf, be &s;o very favourable, that his Vices will come purified through his Lips, and, like foul Liquors well &s;trained, will leave all their Foulne&s;s behind. For tho' the Facts them|&s;elves may appear, yet &s;o different will be the Mo|tives, Circum&s;tances, and Con&s;equences, when a Man tells his own Story, and when his Enemy tells it, that we &s;carce can recognize the Facts to be one and the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Tho' the Barber had drank down this Story with greedy Ears, he was not yet &s;atisfied. There was a Circum&s;tance behind, which his Curio&s;ity, cold as it was, mo&s;t eagerly longed for. <HI>Jones</HI> had mention|ed the Fact of his Amour, and of his being the Ri|val of <HI>Blifil,</HI> but had cautiou&s;ly concealed the Name of the young Lady. The Barber therefore, after &s;ome He&s;itation, and many Hums and Ha's, at la&s;t begged Leave to crave the Name of the Lady, who appeared to be the principal Cau&s;e of all this Mi&s;chief. <HI>Jones</HI> pau&s;ed a Moment, and then &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'Since I have tru&s;t|ed you with &s;o much, and &s;ince I am afraid, her Name is become too public already on this Occa|&s;ion, I will not conceal it from you.

<P>The Wine being now at an End, the Barber pre&s;|&s;ed very eagerly to be his Bottle; but <HI>Jones</HI> ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">'He had already drank more than he ought; and that he now cho&s;e to retire to his Room, where he wi&s;hed he could procure him&s;elf a Book.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'A Book!' cries <HI>Benjamin,</HI> 'what Book would you have? <HI>Latin</HI> or <HI>Engli&s;h?</HI> I have &s;ome curious Books in both Languages.

<P>As for <HI>Jones,</HI> he was well &s;atisfied with the Truth of what the other had a&s;&s;erted, and believed that <HI>Partridge</HI> had no other Inducements but Love to him, and Zeal for the Cau&s;e. A blameable Want of Caution, and Diffidence in the Veracity of others, in which he was highly worthy of Cen&s;ure. To &s;ay the Truth, there are but two Ways by which Men become po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this excellent Quality. The one is from long Experience, and the other is from Na|ture; which la&s;t, I pre&s;ume, is often meant by Ge|nius, or great natural Parts; and it is infinitely the better of the two, not only as we are Ma&s;ters of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> much earlier in Life, but as it is much more infallible and conclu&s;ive: For a Man who hath been impo&s;ed on by ever &s;o many, may &s;till hope to find others more hone&s;t; whereas he who receives certain nece&s;|&s;ary Admonitions from within, that this is impo&s;&s;ible, mu&s;t have very little Under&s;tanding indeed, if he ever renders him&s;elf liable to be once deceived. As <HI>Jones</HI> had not this Gift from Nature, he was too young to have gained it by Experience; for at the diffident Wi&s;dom which is to be acquired this Way, we &s;el|dom arrive till very late in Life; which is perhaps the Rea&s;on why &s;ome old Men are apt to de&s;pi&s;e the Under&s;tandings of all tho&s;e who are a little younger than them&s;elves.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> &s;pent mo&s;t Part of the Day in the Company of a new Acquaintance. This was no other than the Landlord of the Hou&s;e, or rather the Husband of the Landlady.

To be conci&s;e, &s;he is a very friendly, good-natured Woman, and &s;o indu&s;trious to oblige, that the Gue&s;ts mu&s;t be of a very moro&s;e Di&s;po&s;ition who are not extremely well &s;atisfied in her Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Whitefield</HI> happened to be in the Yard when <HI>Jones</HI> and his Attendant marched in. Her Sagacity &s;oon di&s;covered in the Air of our Hero &s;omething which di&s;tingui&s;hed him from the Vulgar. She or|dered her Servants, therefore, immediately to &s;hew him into a Room, and pre&s;ently afterwards invited him to Dinner with her&s;elf; which Invitation he ve|ry thankfully accepted: For indeed much le&s;s agree|able Company than that of Mrs. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> much wor&s;e Entertainment than &s;he had provided would have been welcome, after &s;o long fa&s;ting and &s;o long a Walk.</P>

who lived &s;omewhere near <HI>Lidlinch</HI> in <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire.</HI> This Fellow, I &s;ay, &s;tiled him&s;elf a Lawyer, but was indeed a mo&s;t vile Petty-fogger, without Sen&s;e or Knowledge of any Kind; one of tho&s;e who may be termed Train-bearers to the Law; a Sort of Su|pernumeraries in the Profe&s;&s;ion, who are the Hack|neys of Attornies, and will ride more Miles for half a Crown, than a Po&s;t-boy.</P>
<P>During the time of Dinner, the <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire</HI> Lawyer recollected the Face of <HI>Jones,</HI> which he had &s;een at Mr <HI>Allworthy</HI>'s: For he had often vi&s;ited in that Gentleman's Kitchen. He therefore took Occa|&s;ion to enquire after the good Family there, with that Familiarity which would have become an intimate Friend or Acquaintance of Mr. <HI>Allworthy;</HI> and indeed he did all in his Power to in&s;inuate him&s;elf to be &s;uch, though he had never had the Honour of &s;peaking to any Per&s;on in that Family higher than the Butler. <HI>Jones</HI> an&s;wered all his Que&s;tions with much Civility, though he never remembred to have &s;een the Petty|fogger before, and though he concluded from the outward Appearance and Behaviour of the Man, that he u&s;urped a Freedom with his Betters, to which he was by no means intitled.</P>
<P>As the Conver&s;ation of Fellows of this Kind, is of all others the mo&s;t dete&s;table to Men of any Sen&s;e, the Cloth was no &s;ooner removed than Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> withdrew, and a little barbarou&s;ly left poor Mrs. <HI>Whitefield</HI> to do a Penance, which I have often heard Mr. <HI>Timothy Harris,</HI> and other Publicans of good Ta&s;te, lament, as the &s;evere&s;t Lot annexed to their Calling, namely, that of being obliged to keep Company with their Gue&s;ts.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> had no &s;ooner quitted the Room, than the Petty-fogger, in a whi&s;pering Tone, a&s;ked Mrs. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> <Q REND="inline">'if &s;he knew who that fine Spark was?'</Q> She an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">'&s;he had never &s;een the Gentleman before.

Petty-fogger, 'a pretty Gentleman truly! Why, he's the Ba&s;tard of a Fellow who was hanged for Hor&s;e-&s;tealing.

<P><Q REND="inline">'And very ju&s;tly too, I prote&s;t,' cries <HI>Dowling,</HI> 'I would turn my own Son out of Doors, if he was guilty of half as much. And pray what is the' Name of this pretty Gentleman?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'The Name o'un!' an&s;wered Petty-fogger, 'why, he is a called <HI>Thomas Jones.'</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>Jones!'</HI> an&s;wered <HI>Dowling,</HI> a little eagerly, 'what, Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> that lived at Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI>'s! was that the Gentleman that dined with us?'

'And I am &s;ure,' &s;ays Mrs. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> 'if half what this Gentleman hath &s;aid be true, Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> hath the mo&s;t deceitful Countenance I ever &s;aw; for &s;ure his Looks promi&s;e &s;omething very different; and I mu&s;t &s;ay, for the little I have &s;een of him, he is as civil a well-bred Man as you would wi&s;h to con|ver&s;e with.'</Q></P>
<P>Pettyfogger calling to mind that he had not been &s;worn, as he u&s;ually was, before he gave his Evi|dence, now bound what he had declared with &s;o many Oaths and Imprecations, that the Lady's Ears were &s;hocked, and &s;he put a Stop to his &s;wearing, by a&s;|&s;uring him of her Belief. Upon which he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'I hope, Madam, you imagine I would &s;corn to tell &s;uch Things of any Man, unle&s;s I knew them to be true. What Intere&s;t have I in taking away the Reptutation of a Man who never injured me? I promi&s;e you every Syllable of what I have &s;aid is Fact, and the whole Country knows it.'</Q></P>
<P>As Mrs. <HI>Whitefield</HI> had no Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that the Pettyfogger had any Motive or Temptation to abu&s;e <HI>Jones,</HI> the Reader cannot blame her for be|lieving what he &s;o confidently affirmed with many Oaths. She accordingly gave up her Skill in Phy|&s;iognomy, and henceforwards conceived &s;o ill an Opinion of her Gue&s;t, that &s;he heartily wi&s;hed him out of her Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>This Di&s;like was now farther increa&s;ed by a Re|port which Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> made from the Kitchen, where <HI>Partridge</HI> had informed the Company, <Q REND="inline">'That tho' he carried the Knap&s;ack, and contented him|&s;elf with &s;taying among Servants, while <HI>Tom Jones</HI> (as he called him) was regaling in the Parlour, he was not his Servant, but only a Friend and Com|panion, and as good a Gentleman as Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> him|&s;elf.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="135">
<HI>Dowling</HI> &s;at all this while &s;ilent, biting his Fingers, making Faces, grinning, and looking wonderfully arch; at la&s;t he opened his Lips, and prote&s;ted that the Gen|tleman looked like another Sort of Man. He then called for his Bill with the utmo&s;t Ha&s;te, declared he mu&s;t be at <HI>Hertford</HI> that Evening, lamenting his great Hurry of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and wi&s;hed he could divide him&s;elf into twenty Pieces, in order to be at once in twenty Places.</P>
<P>The Pettyfoggar now likewi&s;e departed, and then <HI>Jones</HI> de&s;ired the Favour of Mrs. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Com|pany to drink Tea with him; but &s;he refu&s;ed, and with a Manner &s;o different from that with which &s;he had received him at Dinner, that it a little &s;urprized him. And now he perceived her Behaviour totally changed; for in&s;tead of that natural Affability which we have before celebrated, &s;he wore a con&s;trained Severity on her Countenance, which was &s;o di&s;agree|able to Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> that he re&s;olved, however late, to quit the Hou&s;e that Evening.</P>
<P>He did indeed account &s;omewhat unfairly for this &s;udden Change; for be&s;ides &s;ome hard and unju&s;t Sur|mi&s;es concerning Female Ficklene&s;s and Mutability, he began to &s;u&s;pect that he owed this want of Civi|lity to his Want of Hor&s;es, a Sort of Animals which, as they dirty no Sheets, are thought in Inns, to pay better for their Beds than their Riders, and are there|fore con&s;idered as the more de&s;irable Company; but Mrs. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> to do her Ju&s;tice, had a much more liberal Way of thinking. She was perfectly well|bred, and could be very civil to a Gentleman, tho' he walked on Foot: In Reality, &s;he looked on our Heroe as a &s;orry Scoundrel, and therefore treated him as &s;uch, for which not even <HI>Jones</HI> him&s;elf, had he known as much as the Reader, could have blamed her; nay, on the Contrary, he mu&s;t have approved her Conduct, and have e&s;teemed her the more for the Di&s;re&s;pect &s;hewn towards him&s;elf. This is indeed
<PB N="127" REF="136">
a mo&s;t aggravating Circum&s;tance which attends un|ju&s;tly depriving Men of their Reputation; for a Man who is Con&s;cious of having an ill Character, cannot ju&s;tly be angry with tho&s;e who neglect and &s;light him; but ought rather to de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e that affect his Conver|&s;ation, unle&s;s where a perfect Intimacy mu&s;t have con|vinced them that their Friend's Character hath been fal&s;ely and injuriou&s;ly a&s;per&s;ed.</P>
<P>This was not, however, the Ca&s;e of <HI>Jones;</HI> for as he was a perfect Stranger to the Truth, &s;o he was with good Rea&s;on offended at the Treatment he received. He therefore paid his Reckoning and departed, highly again&s;t the Will of Mr. <HI>Partridge,</HI> who having remon&s;trated much again&s;t it to no Pur|po&s;e, at la&s;t conde&s;cended to take up his Knap&s;ack, and to attend his Friend.</P>

<P>THE Shadows began now to de&s;cend larger from the high Mountains: The feather'd Creation had betaken them&s;elves to their Re&s;t. Now the high|e&s;t Order of Mortals were &s;itting down to their Din|ners, and the lowe&s;t Order to their Suppers.

and turning to his Companion, a&s;ked him, If he had ever beheld &s;o delicious an Evening. <HI>Par|tride</HI> making no ready An&s;wer to his Que&s;tion, he pro|ceeded to comment on the Beauty of the Moon, and repeated &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages from <HI>Milton,</HI> who hath cer|tainly excelled all other Poets in his De&s;cription of the heavenly Luminaries. He then told <HI>Partridge</HI> the Story from the <HI>Spectator,</HI> of two Lovers who had agreed to entertain them&s;elves when they were at a great Di&s;tance from each other, by repairing, at a certain fixed Hour, to look at the Moon; thus plea&s;|ing them&s;elves with the Thought that they were both employed in contempiating the &s;ame Object at the &s;ame Time. <Q REND="inline">'Tho&s;e Lovers,' added he, 'mu&s;t have had Souls truly capable of feeling all the Ten|derne&s;s of the &s;ublime&s;t of all human Pa&s;&s;ions.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Very probably,' cries <HI>Partridge,</HI> 'but I envy them more if they had Bodies incapable of feeling cold; for I am almo&s;t frozen to Death, and am very much afraid I &s;hall lo&s;e a Piece of my No&s;e before we get to another Hou&s;e of Entertainment.

<P>But however well affected he might be to <HI>James</HI> or <HI>Charles,</HI> he was &s;till much more attached to <HI>Lit|tle Benjamin</HI> than to either: for which Rea&s;on he no &s;ooner di&s;covered the Principles of his Fellow-tra|veller, than he thought proper to conceal, and out|wardly to give up his own to the Man on whom he depended for the making his Fortune, &s;ince he by no means believed the Affairs of <HI>Jones</HI> to be &s;o de|&s;perate as they really were with Mr. <HI>Allworthy;</HI> for as he had kept a con&s;tant Corre&s;pondence with &s;ome of his Neighbours &s;ince he left that Country, he had heard much, indeed more than was true, of the great Affection Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> bore this young Man, who, as <HI>Partridge</HI> had been in&s;tructed, was to be that Gentleman's Heir, and whom, as we have &s;aid, he did not in the lea&s;t doubt to be his Son.</P>
<P>He imagined, therefore, that whatever Quarrel was between them, it would be certainly made up at the Return of Mr. <HI>Jones;</HI> an Event from which he promi&s;ed great Advantages, if he could take this Opportunity of ingratiating him&s;elf with that young Gentleman; and if he could by any Means be in&s;tru|mental in procuring his Return, he doubted not, as we have before &s;aid, but it would as highly advance him in the Favour of Mr. <HI>Allworthy.</HI></P>

<P>At this In&s;tant <HI>Partridge</HI> e&s;pied a glimmering Light through &s;ome Trees, which &s;eemed very near to them. He immediately cried out in a Rapture, <Q REND="inline">'Oh, Sir!

<P>The poor Fellow, however, had no &s;ooner warm|ed him&s;elf, than tho&s;e Thoughts which were always uppermo&s;t in his Mind, began a little to di&s;turb his Brain. There was no Article of his Creed in which he had a &s;tronger Faith, than he had in Witchcraft,

nor can the Reader conceive a Figure more adapted to in&s;pire this Idea, than the old Woman, who now &s;tood before him.

<P>Many Circum&s;tances likewi&s;e con&s;pired to confirm <HI>Partridge</HI> in his Opinion.

'My Brother now at the Age of fifteen, bid adieu to all Learn|ing, and to every Thing el&s;e but to his Dog and Gun, with which latter he became &s;o expert, that, though perhaps you may think it incredible, he could not only hit a &s;tanding Mark with great Certainty; but hath actually &s;hot a Crow as it was flying in the Air. He was likewi&s;e excellent at finding a Hare &s;itting, and was &s;oon reputed one of the be&s;t Sport&s;|men in the Country. A Reputation which both he and his Mother enjoyed as much as if he had been thought the fine&s;t Scholar.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'The Situation of my Brother made me at fir&s;t think my Lot the harder, in being continued at School; but I &s;oon changed my Opinion; for as I advanced pretty fa&s;t in Learning, my Labours be|came ea&s;y, and my Exerci&s;e &s;o delightful, that Ho|lidays were my mo&s;t unplea&s;ant Time: For my Mother, who never loved me, now apprehending that I had the greater Share of my Father's Affec|tion, and finding, or at lea&s;t thinking, that I was more taken Notice of by &s;ome Gentlemen of Learn|ing, and particularly by the Par&s;on of the Pari&s;h, than my Brother, &s;he now hated my Sight, and made Home &s;o di&s;agreeable to me, that what is call|ed by Schoolboys Black Monday, was to me the white&s;t in the whole Year.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Having, at length, gone through the School at <HI>Taunton,</HI> I was thence removed to <HI>Exeter</HI> College in <HI>Oxford,</HI> where I remained four Years at the
<PB N="146" REF="155">
End of which an Accident happened, that put a final End to my Studies, and whence I may truly date the Ri&s;e of all which happened to me afterwards in Life.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'There was at the &s;ame College with my&s;elf one Sir <HI>George Gre&s;ham,</HI> a young Fellow who was in|titled to a very con&s;iderable Fortune; which he was not, by the Will of his Father, to come into full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of till he arrived at the Age of Twenty-five. However, the Liberality of his Guardians gave him litle Cau&s;e to regret the abun|dant Caution of his Father: for they allowed him Five hundred Pound a Year while he remained at the Univer&s;ity, where he kept his Hor&s;es and his Whore, and lived as wicked and as profligate a Life, as he could have done, had he been never &s;o entirely Ma&s;ter of his Fortune; for be&s;ides the Five hundred a Year which he received from his Guar|dians, he found Means to &s;pend a thou&s;and more. He was above the Age of Twenty-one, and had no Difficulty of gaining what Credit he plea&s;ed.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'This young Fellow, among many other tolera|ble bad Qualities, had one very diabolical. He had a great Delight in de&s;troying and ruining the Youth of inferior Fortune, by drawing them into Expences which they could not afford &s;o well as him&s;elf; and the better, and worthier, and &s;oberer, any young Man was, the greater Plea&s;ure and Triumph had he in his De&s;truction. Thus acting the Character which is recorded of the Devil, and going about &s;eeking whom he might devour.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'It was my Misfortune to fall into an Acquain|tance and Intimacy with this Gentleman. My Re|putation of Diligence in my Studies made me a de|&s;irable Object of his mi&s;chievous Intention; and my own Inclination made it &s;ufficiently ea&s;y for him to effect his Purpo&s;e; for tho' I had applied my&s;elf with much Indu&s;try to Books, in which I took
<PB N="147" REF="156">
great Delight, there were other Plea&s;ures in which I was capable of taking much greater; for I was high-mettled, had a violent Flow of animal Spi|rits, was a little ambitious, and extremely amo|rous.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'I had not long contracted an Intimacy with Sir <HI>George,</HI> before I became a Partaker of all his Plea|&s;ures; and when I was once entered on that Scene, neither my Inclination, nor my Spirit, would &s;uf|fer me to play an Under-Part. I was &s;econd to none of the Company in any Acts of Debauchery: nay, I &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed my&s;elf &s;o notably in all Riots and Di&s;orders, that my Name generally &s;tood fir&s;t in the Roll of Delinquents, and in&s;tead of being lamented as the unfortunate Pupil of Sir <HI>George,</HI> I was now accu&s;ed as the Per&s;on who had mi&s;led and debauched that hopeful young Gentle|man; for tho' he was the Ring-leader and Pro|moter of all the Mi&s;chief, he was never &s;o con&s;ider|ed. I fell at la&s;t under the Cen&s;ure of the Vice-Chancellor, and very narrowly e&s;caped Expul&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'You will ea&s;ily believe, Sir, that &s;uch a Life, as I am now de&s;cribing mu&s;t be incompatible with my further Progre&s;s in Learning; and that in Propor|tion as I addicted my&s;elf more and more to loo&s;e Plea&s;ure, I mu&s;t grow more and more remi&s;s in Application to my Studies. This was truly the Con&s;equence; but this was not all. My Expen|ces now greatly exceeded not only my former In|come, but tho&s;e Additions which I extorted from my poor generous Father, by Pretences of Sums nece&s;&s;ary for preparing for my approaching Degree of Batchelor of Arts. The&s;e Demands, however, grew at la&s;t &s;o frequent and exorbitant, that my Fa|ther, by &s;low Degrees, opened his Ears to the Ac|counts which he received from many Quarters of my pre&s;ent Behaviour, and which my Mother failed not to echo very faithfully and loudly; adding, 'Ay,

<P><Q REND="inline">'My Father, therefore, began now to return Re|mon&s;trances, in&s;tead of Money, to my Demands, which brought my Affairs, perhaps a little &s;oon|er to a Cri&s;is; but had he remitted me his whole In|come, you will imagine it could have &s;ufficed a ve|ry &s;hort Time to &s;upport one who kept Pace with the Expences of Sir <HI>George Gre&s;ham.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'It is more than po&s;&s;ible, that the Di&s;tre&s;s I was now in for Money, and the Impracticability of going on in this Manner, might have re&s;tored me at once to my Sen&s;es, and to my Studies, had I opened my Eyes, before I became involved in Debts, from which I &s;aw no Hopes of ever extricating my&s;elf. This was indeed the great Art of Sir <HI>George,</HI> and by which he accompli&s;hed the Ruin of many, whom he afterwards laughed at as Fools and Coxcombs, for vying as he called it, with a Man of his For|tune. To bring this about, he would now and then advance a little Money him&s;elf, in order to &s;upport the Credit of the unfortunate Youth with other People; till, by Means of that very Credit, he was irretrievably undone.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'My Mind being by the&s;e Means, grown as de&s;|perate as my Fortune, there was &s;carce a Wicked|ne&s;s which I did not meditate, in order for my Relief.

After which I again conveyed his Key into his Pocket, and counterfeiting Sleep, tho' I never once clo&s;ed my Eyes, lay in Bed till after he aro&s;e and went to Prayers, an Exerci&s;e to which I had long been unaccu&s;tomed.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Timorous Thieves, by extreme Caution, often &s;ubject them&s;elves to Di&s;coveries, which tho&s;e of a bolder Kind e&s;cape.

I had, perhaps, e&s;caped even his Su&s;picion; but as it was plain that the Per&s;on who robbed him had po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of his Key, he had no Doubt, when he fir&s;t mi&s;&s;ed his Money, but that his Chum was certainly the Thief. Now as he was of a fearful Di&s;po&s;ition, and much my Inferior in Strength, and, I believe, in Courage, he did not dare to con|front me with my Guilt, for fear of wor&s;e bodily Con&s;equences which might happen to him. He repaired therefore immediately to the Vice-Chan|cellor,
<PB N="150" REF="159">
and, upon &s;wearing to the Robbery, and to the Circum&s;tances of it, very ea&s;ily obtained a Warrant again&s;t one who had now &s;o bad a Cha|racter through the whole Univer&s;ity.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Luckily for me I lay out of the College the next Evening; for that Day I attended a young Lady in a Chai&s;e to <HI>Whitney,</HI> where we &s;taid all Night; and in our Return the next Morning to <HI>Oxford,</HI> I met one of my Cronies, who acquainted me with &s;ufficient News concerning my&s;elf to make me turn my Hor&s;e another Way.'</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">'Having now abandoned all Thoughts of return|ing to <HI>Oxford,</HI> the next Thing which offered it&s;elf was a Journey to <HI>London.</HI> I imparted this Inten|tion to my female Companion, who at fir&s;t remon|&s;trated again&s;t it, but upon producing my Wealth, &s;he immediately con&s;ented.

in&s;tead of being longer de&s;irable, grew the Object of my Abhorrence, and I could have gladly em|braced Death, as my deare&s;t Friend, if it had offer|ed it&s;elf to my Choice unattended by Shame.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'The Time of the A&s;&s;izes &s;oon came, and I was removed by <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> to <HI>Oxford,</HI> where I ex|pected certain Conviction and Condemnation; but, to my great Surprize, none appeared again&s;t me, and I was, at the End of the Se&s;&s;ions, di&s;charged for Want of Pro&s;ecution.

<P><Q REND="inline">'I Had now regained my Liberty, &s;aid the Stran|ger, but I had lo&s;t my Reputation; for there is a wide Difference between the Ca&s;e of a Man who is barely acquitted of a Crime in a Court of Ju&s;tice, and of him who is acquitted in his own Heart, and in the Opinion of the People. I was con&s;cious of my Guilt, and a&s;hamed to look any one in the Face, &s;o re&s;olved to leave <HI>Oxford</HI> the next Morn|ing,

<P><Q REND="inline">'I ha&s;tened therefore back to <HI>London,</HI> the be&s;t Re|tirement of either Grief or Shame, unle&s;s for Per|&s;ons of a very publick Character; for here you have the Advantage of Solitude without its Di&s;ad|vantage, &s;ince you may be alone and in Company at the &s;ame Time; and while you walk or &s;it un|ob&s;erved, Noi&s;e, Hurry, and a con&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion of Objects, entertain the Mind, and prevent the Spirits from preying on them&s;elves, or rather on Grief or Shame, which are the mo&s;t unwhole&s;ome Diet in the World; and on which (though there are many who never ta&s;te either but in public) there are &s;ome who can feed very plentifully, and very fatally when alone.'</Q></P>

This Gentleman, who&s;e Name was <HI>Wat&s;on,</HI> &s;hook me heartily by the Hand, and expre&s;&s;ing great Joy at meeting me, propo&s;ed our immediately drinking a Bottle together. I fir&s;t declined the Propo&s;al, and pretended Bu&s;ine&s;s; but as he was very earne&s;t and pre&s;&s;ing, Hunger at la&s;t overcame my Pride, and I fairly confe&s;&s;ed to him I had no Money in my Pocket; yet not without framing a Lie for an Ex|cu&s;e, and imputing it to my having changed my Breeches that Morning. Mr. <HI>Wat&s;on</HI> an&s;wered, I thought <HI>Jack,</HI> you and I had been too old Acquaintance for you to mention &s;uch a Matter. He then took me by the Arm and was pulling me along; but I gave him very little Trouble, for

my own Inclinations pulled me much &s;tronger than he could do.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'We then went into the Friers, which you know is the Scene of all Mirth and Jollity.

However, as the Ca&s;e was really otherwi&s;e, I forged another Fal&s;hood, and told my Companion, I had been at the further End of the City on Bu&s;ine&s;s of Con&s;equence, and had &s;napt up a Mutton Chop in Ha&s;te, &s;o that I was again Hungry, and wi&s;hed he would add a Beef Steak to his Bottle.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Some People, cries <HI>Par|tridge,</HI> 'ought to have good Memories, or did you find ju&s;t Money enough in your Breeches to pay for the Mutton Chop?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Your Ob&s;ervation is right,' an&s;wered the Stranger, 'and I believe &s;uch Blunders are in&s;eparable from all dealing in Untruth.&mdash;But to proceed&mdash;I began now to feel my&s;elf extreme|ly happy.

<P><Q REND="inline">'This Declaration a little relieved my Aba&s;hment, and as Wine had now &s;omewhat opened my Heart, I very freely acknowledged the Robbery, but ac|quainted him that he had been mi&s;informed as to the Sum taken, which was little more than a fifth Part of what he had mentioned.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'I am &s;orry for it with all my Heart, quoth he, and I wi&s;h thee better Succe&s;s another Time.

<P><Q REND="inline">'The Bill was now brought, when <HI>Wat&s;on</HI> paid his Share, and was departing.

<P><Q REND="inline">'He then went down, and I was prevailed on to take up the Money and follow him, which I did clo&s;e enough to hear him tell the Drawer the Reckoning was upon the Table.

<P><Q REND="inline">'We now went directly to the Gaming Table, where Mr. <HI>Wat&s;on,</HI> to my Surprize, pulled out a large Sum of Money, and placed before him, as did many others; all of them, no doubt, con&s;i|dering their own Heaps as &s;o many decoy Birds,

<P><Q REND="inline">'Here it would be tedious to relate all the Freaks which Fortune, or rather the Dice, played in this her Temple.

<P><Q REND="inline">'For my own Part, after having con&s;iderably im|proved my &s;mall E&s;tate, I at la&s;t entirely demoli&s;hed it.

<P><Q REND="inline">'I was at fir&s;t a little &s;hocked at returning to the &s;ame Hou&s;e whence we had departed in &s;o unhand|&s;ome a Manner; but when the Drawer, with very civil Addre&s;s, told us, "he believed we had for|got to pay our Reckoning," I became perfectly ea&s;y, and very readily gave him a Guinea, bid him pay him&s;elf, and acquie&s;ced in the unju&s;t Charge which had been laid on my Memory.'</Q></P>

As I was in no Danger from Pick-pockets, I ventered into the Croud, where upon enquiry, I found that a Man had been robbed and very ill u&s;ed by &s;ome Ruffians. The wounded Man appeared very bloody, and &s;eemed &s;carce able to &s;upport him&s;elf on his Legs. As I had not therefore been deprived of my Humanity by my pre&s;ent Life and Conver&s;ation, tho' they had left me very little of either Hone&s;ty or Shame, I immediately offered my A&s;&s;i&s;tance to the unhappy Per&s;on, who thank|fully accepted it, and putting him&s;elf under my Conduct, begged me to convey him to &s;ome Ta|vern, where he might &s;end for a Surgeon, being, as he &s;aid, faint with Lo&s;s of Blood.

The&s;e, Sir, are the Ob&s;ervations on Men which I made in my Travels, for the&s;e were the only Men I ever con|ver&s;ed with. My De&s;ign when I went abroad, was to divert my&s;elf by &s;eeing the wondrous Va|riety of Pro&s;pects, Bea&s;ts, Birds, Fi&s;hes, In&s;ects, and Vegetables, with which God has been plea&s;ed to enrich the &s;everal Parts of this Globe. A Va|riety, which as it mu&s;t give great Plea&s;ure to a con|templative Beholder, &s;o doth it admirably di&s;play the Power and Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s of the Crea|tor.

<P>AMONG other good U&s;es for which I have thought proper to in&s;titute the&s;e &s;everal in|troductory Chapters, I have con&s;idered them as a Kind of Mark or Stamp, which may hereafter enable a very indifferent Reader to di&s;tingui&s;h, what is true and genuine in this hi&s;toric kind of Writing, from what is fal&s;e and counterfeit. Indeed it &s;eems likely that &s;ome &s;uch Mark may &s;hortly become ne|ce&s;&s;ary, &s;ince the favourable Reception which two or three Authors have lately procured for their Works of this Nature from the Public, will probably &s;erve as an Encroachment to many others to undertake the like. Thus a Swarm of fooli&s;h Novels, and mon|&s;trous Romances will be produced, either to the great impoveri&s;hing of Book&s;ellers, or to the great Lo&s;s of Time, and Depravation of Morals in the Reader;

nay, often to the &s;preading of Scandal and Calumny, and to the Prejudice of the Characters of many wor|thy and hone&s;t People.</P>
<P>I que&s;tion not but the ingenious Author of the Spectator was principally induced to perfix <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Mottos to every Paper from the &s;ame Con&s;i|deration of guarding again&s;t the Pur&s;uit of tho&s;e Scrib|blers, who, having no Talents of a Writer but what is taught by the Writing-ma&s;ter, are yet no wi&s;e afraid nor more a&s;hamed to a&s;&s;ume the &s;ame Titles with the greate&s;t Genius, than their good Brother in the Fable was of braying in the Lion's Skin.</P>
<P>By the Device therefore of his Motto, it became impracticable for any Man to pre&s;ume to imitate the Spectators, without under&s;tanding at lea&s;t one Sen|tence in the learned Languages. In the &s;ame Man|ner I have now &s;ecured my&s;elf from the Imitation of tho&s;e who are utterly incapable of any Degree of Reflection, and who&s;e Learning is not equal to an E&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P>I would not here be under&s;tood to in&s;inuate, that the greate&s;t Merit of &s;uch hi&s;torical Productions can ever lie in the&s;e introductory Chapters; but, in Fact, tho&s;e Parts which contain mere Narrative only, afford much more Encouragement to the Pen of an Imitator, than tho&s;e which are compo&s;ed of Ob&s;ervation and Reflection. Here I mean &s;uch Imitators as <HI>Rowe</HI> was of <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> or as <HI>Horace</HI> hints &s;ome of the the <HI>Romans</HI> were of <HI>Cato,</HI> by bare Feet and &s;our Faces.</P>
<P>To invent good Stories, and to tell them well, are po&s;&s;ibly very rare Talents, and yet I have ob&s;erv|ed few Per&s;ons who have &s;crupled to aim at both; and if we examine the Romances and Novels with which the world abounds, I think we may fairly conclude that mo&s;t of the Authors would not have attempted to &s;hew their Teeth (if the Expre&s;&s;ion may be al|lowed me) in any other Way of Writing; nor could indeed have &s;trung together a dozen Sentences on any other Subject whatever. <HI>Scribimus indocti docti&abque;</HI>

Here they were no &s;ooner ar+rived, than they heard at a Di&s;tance the mo&s;t violent Skreams of a Woman, proceeding from the Wood be|low them. <HI>Jones</HI> li&s;tened a Moment, and then, without &s;aying a Word to his Companion (for indeed the Occa&s;ion &s;eemed &s;ufficiently pre&s;&s;ing) ran, or ra|ther &s;lid, down the Hill, and without the lea&s;t Ap|prehen&s;ions or Concern for his own Safety, made directly to the Thicket whence the Sound had i&s;&s;ued.</P>
<P>He had not entered far into the Wood before he beheld a mo&s;t &s;hocking Sight indeed, a Woman &s;trip half naked, under the Hands of a Ruffian, who had put his Garter round her Neck, and was endeavour|ing to draw her up to a Tree. <HI>Jones</HI> a&s;ked no Que&s;|tions at this Interval; but fell in&s;tantly upon the Vil|lian, and made &s;uch good U&s;e of his tru&s;ty Oaken Stick<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> that he laid him &s;prawling on the Ground, before h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> could defend him&s;elf, indeed almo&s;t before he knew he was attacked; nor did he cea&s;e the Pro&s;ecution o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">

<HI>Jones</HI> helped <HI>Northerton</HI> upon his Legs, and then looking him &s;tedfa&s;tly in the Face, <Q REND="inline">'I fancy, Sir,' &s;aid he, 'you did not expect to meet me any more in this World, and I confe&s;s I had as little Expectation to find you here.

<P><Q REND="inline">'Doth it become &s;uch a Villain as you are,' cries <HI>Jones,</HI> 'to contaminate the Name of Honour by a&s;|&s;uming it?

<P>She an&s;wered, She was an entire Stranger in that Part of the World. <HI>Jones</HI> then recollecting him&s;elf, &s;aid he had a Friend near, who would direct them; indeed he wondered at his not following; but, in Fact, the Good Man of the Hill, when our Heroe departed, &s;at him&s;elf down on the Brow, where, tho' he had a Gun in his Hand, he with great Patience and Un|concern, had attended the I&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> then &s;tepping without the Wood, perceived the old Man &s;itting as we have ju&s;t de&s;cribed him; he pre&s;ently exerted his utmo&s;t Agility, and with &s;urpriz|ing Expedition a&s;cended the Hill.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="206">
The old Man advi&s;ed him to carry the Woman to <HI>Upton,</HI> which, he &s;aid, was the neare&s;t Town, and there he would be &s;ure of furni&s;hing her with all man|ner of Conveniences. <HI>Jones</HI> having received his Di|rection to the Place, took his Leave of the Man of the Hill, and de&s;iring him to direct <HI>Partridge</HI> the &s;ame Way, returned ha&s;tily to the Wood.</P>
<P>Our Heroe, at his Departure to make this Enquiry of his Friend, had con&s;idered, that as the Ruffian's Hands were tied behind him, he was incapable of exe|cuting any wicked Purpo&s;es on the poor Woman. Be&s;ides, he knew he &s;hould not be beyond the Reach of her Voice, and could return &s;oon enough to prevent any Mi&s;chief. He had moreover declared to the Vil|lain, that if he attempted the lea&s;t In&s;ult, he would be him&s;elf immediately the Executioner of Vengeance on him. But <HI>Jones</HI> unluckily forgot that tho' the Hands of <HI>Northerton</HI> were tied, his Legs were at Liberty; nor did he lay the lea&s;t Injunction on the Pri&s;oner, that he &s;hould not make what u&s;e of the&s;e he plea&s;ed. <HI>Nor|therton</HI> therefore having given no Parole of that Kind, thought he might, without any Breach of Honour, depart, not being obliged, as he imagined, by any Rules, to wait for a formal Di&s;charge. He there|fore took up his Legs, which were at Liberty, and walked off thro' the Wood, which favoured his Re|treat; nor did the Woman, who&s;e Eyes were perhaps rather turned towards her Deliverer, once think of his E&s;cape, or give her&s;elf any Concern or Trouble to prevent it.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> therefore, at his Return, found the Woman alone. He would have &s;pent &s;ome Time in &s;earch|ing for <HI>Northerton;</HI> but &s;he would not permit him; earne&s;tly entreating that he would accompany her to the Town whither they had been directed. <Q REND="inline">'As to the Fellow's E&s;cape,' &s;aid &s;he, 'it gives me no Un|ea&s;ine&s;s: For Philo&s;ophy and Chri&s;tianity both preach up Forgivene&s;s of Injuries. But for you, Sir, I

am concerned at the Trouble I give you, nay in|deed my Nakedne&s;s may well make me a&s;hamed to look you in the Face; and if it was not for the Sake of your Protection, I &s;hould wi&s;h to go alone.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> offered her his Coat; but, I know not for what Rea&s;on, &s;he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed the mo&s;t earne&s;t Solicitations to accept it. He then begged her to for|get both the Cau&s;es of her Confu&s;ion. <Q REND="inline">'With Re|gard to the former,' &s;ays he, 'I have done no more than my Duty in protecting you; and as for the latter, I will entirely remove it, by walking before you all the Way; for I would not have my Eyes offend you, and I could not an&s;wer for my Power of re&s;i&s;ting the attractive Charms of &s;o much Beauty.'</Q></P>
<P>Thus our Heroe and the redeemed Lady walked in the &s;ame Manner as <HI>Orpheus</HI> and <HI>Eurydice</HI> marched heretofore: But tho' I cannot believe that <HI>Jones</HI> was de&s;ignedly tempted by his Fair One to look behind him, yet as &s;he frequently wanted his A&s;&s;i&s;tance to help her over Stiles, and had be&s;ides many Trips and other Accidents, he was often obliged to turn about.

<P>Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> and his fair Companion no &s;ooner en|tered the Town, than they went directly to that Inn which, in their Eyes, pre&s;ented the faire&s;t Appear|ance to the Street. Here <HI>Jones,</HI> having ordered a Servant to &s;hew a Room above Stairs, was a&s;cend|ing, when the di&s;hevelled Fair ha&s;tily following, was laid hold on by the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e, who cried, <Q REND="inline">'Hey day, where is that Beggar Wench going? &s;tay below Stairs, I de&s;ire you;'</Q> but <HI>Jones</HI> at that In|&s;tant thundered from above, 'Let the Lady come 'up,' in &s;o authoritative a Voice, that the good Man in&s;tantly withdrew his Hands, and the Lady made the be&s;t of her way to the Chamber.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Jones</HI> wi&s;hed her Joy of her &s;afe Arrival, and then departed, in order, as he promi&s;ed, to &s;end, the Landlady up with &s;ome Cloaths. The poor Wo|man thanked him heartily for all his Kindne&s;s, and &s;aid, She &s;hould &s;ee him again &s;oon, to thank him a thou&s;and Times more. During this &s;hort Conver&s;ati|on, &s;he covered her white Bo&s;om as well as &s;he could po&s;&s;ibly with her Arms: For <HI>Jones</HI> could not avoid &s;tealing a Peep or two, tho' he took all imaginable Care to avoid giving any Offence.</P>
<P>Our Travellers had happened to take up their Re|&s;idence at a Hou&s;e of exceeding good Repute, whi|ther <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Ladies of &s;trict Virtue, and many Nor|thern La&s;&s;es of the &s;ame Predicament, were accu&s;|tomed to re&s;ort in their Way to <HI>Bath.</HI> The Land|lady therefore would by no Means have admitted any Conver&s;ation of a di&s;reputable Kind to pa&s;s under her Roof.

My good Landlady did not hope for &s;uch a Ble&s;&s;ing, nor would any of the Ladies I have &s;poken of, or indeed any others of the mo&s;t rigid Note, have expected or in&s;i&s;ted on any &s;uch Thing. But to exclude all Vulgar Concubinage, and to drive all Whores in Rags from within the Walls, is within the Power of every one. This my Landlady very &s;tiffly adhered to, and this her virtu|ous Gue&s;ts, who did not travel in Rags, would very rea&s;onably have expected of her.</P>
<P>Now it required no very blameable Degree of Su&s;|picion, to imagine that Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> and his ragged Companion had certain Purpo&s;es in their Intention, which, tho' tolerated in &s;ome Chri&s;tian Countries, connived at in others, and practi&s;ed in all; are how|ever as expre&s;sly forbidden as Murder, or any o|ther horrid Vice, by that Religion which is univer&s;ally believed in tho&s;e Countries. The Landlady there|fore had no &s;ooner received an Intimation of the En|trance of the above&s;aid Per&s;ons, than &s;he began to meditate the mo&s;t expeditious Means for their Ex|pul&s;ion. In order to this, &s;he had provided her&s;elf with a long and deadly In&s;trument, with which, in Times of Peace, the Chambermaid was wont to de|moli&s;h the Labours of the Indu&s;trious Spider. In vulgar Phra&s;e, &s;he had taken up the Broom&s;tick, and was ju&s;t about to &s;ally from the Kitchen, when <HI>Jones</HI> acco&s;ted her with a Demand of a Gown, and other Ve&s;tments, to cover the half naked woman above Stairs.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more provoking to the human Temper, nor more dangerous to that cardinal Vir|tue, Patience, than Solicitations of extraordinary Of|fices of Kindne&s;s, on Behalf of tho&s;e very Per&s;ons with whom we are highly incen&s;ed. For this Rea|&s;on

In Fact, we regard the&s;e Efforts as In&s;ults on our Under&s;tanding, and to &s;uch the Pride of Man is very difficultly brought to &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>My Landlady, though a very good-tempered Wo|man, had, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;ome of this Pride in her Compo|&s;ition; for <HI>Jones</HI> had &s;carce ended his Reque&s;t, when &s;he fell upon him with a certain Weapon, which tho' it be neither long, nor &s;harp, nor hard, nor indeed threatens from its Appearance with either Death or Wound, hath been however held in great Dread and Abhorrence by many wi&s;e Men; nay, by many brave ones; in&s;omuch that &s;ome who have dared to look into the Mouth of a loaded Cannon, have not dared to look into a Mouth where this Weapon was bran|di&s;hed; and rather than run the Hazard of its Exe|cution, have contented them&s;elves with making a mo&s;t pitiful and &s;neaking Figure in the Eyes of all their Acquaintance.</P>
<P>To Confe&s;s the Truth, I am afraid Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> was one of the&s;e; for tho' he was attacked and vio|lently belaboured with the afore&s;aid Weapon, he could not be provoked to make any Re&s;i&s;tance; but in a mo&s;t cowardly Manner applied, with many Entrea|tries, to his Antagoni&s;t to de&s;i&s;t from pur&s;uing her Blows; in plain <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> he only begged her with the utmo&s;t Earne&s;tne&s;s to hear him; but before he could obtain his Reque&s;t, my Landlord him&s;elf en|tered into the Fray, and embraced that Side of the Cau&s;e which &s;eemed to &s;tand very little in need of A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>

There are a Sort of Heroes who are &s;uppo&s;ed to be determined in their chu&s;ing or avoiding a Conflict by the Character and Behaviour of the Per&s;on whom they are to engage. The&s;e are &s;aid to know their Man, and <HI>Jones,</HI> I believe, knew his Woman; for tho' he had been &s;o &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to her, he was no &s;oon|er attacked by her Hu&s;band, than he demon&s;trated an immediate Spirit of Re&s;entment, and enjoined him Silence under a very &s;evere Penalty; no le&s;s than that, I think, of being converted into Fuel for his own Fire.</P>
<P>The Hu&s;band, with great Indignation, but with a Mixture of Pity, an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">'You mu&s;t pray fir&s;t to be made able; I believe I am a better Man than your&s;elf; ay, every Way, that I am;'</Q> and pre|&s;ently proceeded to di&s;charge half a dozen Whores at the Lady above Stairs, the la&s;t of which had &s;carce i&s;&s;ued from his Lips, when a &s;winging Blow from the Cudgel that <HI>Jones</HI> carried in his Hand a&s;&s;aulted him over the Shoulders.</P>
<P>It is a Que&s;tion whether the Landlord or the Land|lady was the mo&s;t expeditious in returning this Blow. My Landlord, who&s;e Hands were empty, fell to with his Fi&s;t, and the good Wife, uplifting her Broom, and aiming at the Head of <HI>Jones,</HI> had probably put an immediate End to the Fray, and to <HI>Jones</HI> like|wi&s;e, had not the De&s;cent of this Broom been pre|vented&mdash;not by the miraculous Intervention of any Heathen Deity, but by a very natural, tho' for|tunate Accident; <HI>viz.</HI> by the Arrival of <HI>Partridge;</HI> who entered the Hou&s;e at that In&s;tant (for Fear had cau&s;ed him to run every Step from the Hill) and who, &s;eeing the Danger which threatened his Ma&s;ter, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Companion, (which you chu&s;e to call him) prevented &s;o &s;ad a Cata&s;trophe, by catching hold of the Land|lady's Arm, as it was brandi&s;hed aloft in the Air.</P>
<P>The Landlady &s;oon perceived the Impediment which prevented her Blow; and being unable to
<PB N="203" REF="212">
re&s;cue her Arm from the Hands of <HI>Partridge,</HI> &s;he let fall the Broom, and then leaving <HI>Jones</HI> to the Di&s;cipline of her Hu&s;band, &s;he fell with the utmo&s;t Fury on that poor Fellow, who had already given &s;ome Intimation of him&s;elf, by crying, 'Zounds! do 'you intend to kill my Friend?'</P>
<P><HI>Partridge,</HI> though not much addicted to Battle, would not however &s;tand &s;till when his Friend was attacked; nor was he much di&s;plea&s;ed with that Part of the Combat which fell to his Share: He there|fore returned my Landlady's Blows as &s;oon as he re|ceived them; and now the Fight was ob&s;tinately maintained on all Parts, and it &s;eemed doubtful to which Side Fortune would incline, when the naked Lady, who had li&s;tened at the Top of the Stairs to the Dialogue which preceded the Engagement, de|&s;cended &s;uddenly from above, and without weighing the unfair Inequality of two to one, fell upon the poor Woman who was boxing with <HI>Partridge;</HI> nor did that great Champion de&s;i&s;t, but rather redoubled his Fury, when he found fre&s;h Succours were arrived to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Victory mu&s;t now have fallen to the Side of the Travellers (for the brave&s;t Troops mu&s;t yield to Numbers) had not <HI>Su&s;an</HI> the Chambermaid come luckily to &s;upport her Mi&s;tre&s;s. This <HI>Su&s;an</HI> was as two-handed a Wench (according to the Phra&s;e) as any in the Country, and would, I believe, have beat the famed <HI>Thale&s;tris</HI> her&s;elf, or any of her &s;ub|ject <HI>Amazons;</HI> for her Form was robu&s;t and manlike, and every Way made for &s;uch Encounters. As her Hands and Arms were formed to give Blows with great Mi&s;chief to an Enemy, &s;o was her Face as well contrived to receive Blows without any great Injury to her&s;elf: Her No&s;e being already flat to her Face; her Lips were &s;o large that no Swelling could be per|ceived in them, and moreover they were &s;o hard,
<PB N="204" REF="213">
that a Fi&s;t could hardly make any Impre&s;&s;ion on them. La&s;tly, her Cheek-Bones &s;tood out, as if Nature had intended them for two Ba&s;tions to defend her Eyes in tho&s;e Encounters for which &s;he &s;eemed &s;o well calculated, and to which &s;he was mo&s;t wonder|fully well inclined.</P>
<P>This fair Creature entering the Field of Battle, im|mediately filed to that Wing where her Mi&s;tre&s;s maintained &s;o unequal a Fight with one of either Sex. Here &s;he pre&s;ently challenged <HI>Partridge</HI> to &s;ingle Com|bat. He accepted the Challenge, and a mo&s;t de&s;pe|rate Fight began between them.</P>
<P>Now the Dogs of War being let loo&s;e, began to lick their bloody Lips; now Victory with Golden Wings hung hovering in the Air. Now Fortune tak|ing her Scales from her Shelf, began to weigh the Fates of <HI>Tom Jones,</HI> his Female Companion, and <HI>Par|tridge,</HI> again&s;t the Landlord, his Wife, and Maid; all which hung in exact Ballance before her; when a good-natured Accident put &s;uddenly an End to the bloody Fray, with which half of the Combatants had already &s;ufficiently fea&s;ted. This Accident was the Arrival of a Coach and four; upon which my Land|lord and Landlady immediately de&s;i&s;ted from fighting, and at their Entreaty obtained the &s;ame Favour of their Antagoni&s;ts; but <HI>Su&s;an</HI> was not &s;o kind to <HI>Partridge,</HI> for that <HI>Amazonian</HI> Fair having overthrown and be|&s;trid her Enemy, was now cuffing him lu&s;tily with both her Hands, without any Regard to his Reque&s;t of a Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms, or to tho&s;e loud Acclamations of Murder which he roared forth.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner, however, had <HI>Jones</HI> quitted the Land|lord, than he flew to the Re&s;cue of his defeated Com|panion, from whom he with much Difficulty drew off the enraged Chambermaid; but <HI>Partridge</HI> was not immediately &s;en&s;ible of his Deliverance; for he &s;till lay flat on the Floor, guarding his Face with his Hands, nor did he cea&s;e roaring till <HI>Jones</HI> had forced
<PB N="205" REF="214">
him to look up, and to perceive that the Battle was at an End.</P>
<P>The Landlord who had no vi&s;ible Hurt, and the Landlady hiding her well &s;cratched Face with her Handkerchief ran both ha&s;tily to the Door to attend the Coach, from which a young Lady and her Maid now alighted. The&s;e the Landlady pre&s;ently u&s;hered into that Room where Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> had at fir&s;t depo&s;ited his fair Prize, as it was the be&s;t Apartment in the Hou&s;e. Hither they were obliged to pa&s;s through the Field of Battle, which they did with the utmo&s;t Ha&s;te, covering their Faces with their Handkerchiefs, as de|&s;irous to avoid the Notice of any one. Indeed their Caution was quite unnece&s;&s;ary: For the poor unfor|tunate <HI>Helen,</HI> the fatal Cau&s;e of all the Blood&s;hed, was entirely taken up in endeavouring to conceal her own Face, and <HI>Jones</HI> was no le&s;s occupied in re&s;cuing <HI>Par|tridge</HI> from the Fury of <HI>Su&s;an;</HI> which being happily effected, the poor Fellow immediately departed to the Pump to wa&s;h his Face, and to &s;top that bloody Tor|rent which <HI>Su&s;an</HI> had plentifully &s;et a flowing from his No&s;trils.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>In which the Arrival of a Man of War puts a final End to Ho&s;tilities, and cau&s;es the Conclu&s;ion of a firm and la&s;ting Peace between all Parties.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A Serjeant and a File of Mu&s;queteers, with a De|&s;erter in their Cu&s;tody, arrived about this Time. The Serjeant pre&s;ently enquired for the principal Ma|gi&s;trate of the Town, and was informed by my Land|lord, that he him&s;elf was ve&s;ted in that Office. He then demanded his Billets, together with a Mug of Beer, and complaining it was cold, &s;pread him&s;elf before the Kitchen Fire.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> was at this Time comforting the poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Lady, who &s;at down at a Table in the
<PB N="206" REF="215">
Kitchen, and leaning her Head upon her Arm, was bemoaning her Misfortunes; but le&s;t my fair Readers &s;hould be in Pain concerning a particular Circum&s;tance, I think proper here to acquaint them, that before &s;he had quitted the Room above Stairs, &s;he had &s;o well covered her&s;elf with a Pillowbere which &s;he there found, that her Regard to Decency was not in the lea&s;t violated by the Pre&s;ence of &s;o many Men as were now in the Room.</P>
<P>One of the Soldiers now went up to the Serjeant, and whi&s;pered &s;omething in his Ear; upon which he &s;tedfa&s;tly fixed his Eyes on the Lady, and having look|ed at her for near a Minute, he came up to her, &s;ay|ing, <Q REND="inline">'I a&s;k Pardon, Madam, but I am certain I am not deceived, you can be no other Per&s;on than Cap|tain <HI>Waters</HI>'s Lady.'</Q></P>
<P>The poor Woman, who in her pre&s;ent Di&s;tre&s;s had very little regarded the Face of any Per&s;on pre&s;ent, no &s;ooner looked at the Serjeant, than &s;he pre&s;ently recollected him, and calling him by his Name, an|&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">'That &s;he was indeed the unhappy Per&s;on he imagined her to be; but added, I wonder any one &s;hould know me in this Di&s;gui&s;e.'</Q> To which the Serjeant replied, <Q REND="inline">'he was very much &s;urprized to &s;ee her Lady&s;hip in &s;uch a Dre&s;s, and was afraid &s;ome Accident had happened to her.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'An Accident hath happened to me, indeed,' &s;ays &s;he, 'and I am highly obliged to this Gentleman (pointing to <HI>Jones)</HI> that it was not a fatal one, or that I am now living to mention it.'</Q> <Q REND="inline"> 'Whatever the Gentleman hath done,' cries the Serjeant, 'I am &s;ure the Captain will make him Amends for it; and if I can be of any Service, your Lady&s;hip may command me, and I &s;hall think my&s;elf very happy to have it in my Power to &s;erve your Lady&s;hip; and &s;o indeed may any one, for I know the Captain will well reward them for it.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="216">
The Landlady who heard from the Stairs all that pa&s;t between the Serjeant and Mrs. <HI>Waters,</HI> came ha&s;|tily down, and running directly up to her, began to a&s;k Pardon for the Offences &s;he had committed, beg|ging that all might be imputed to Ignorance of her Quality: For, <Q REND="inline"> 'Lud! Madam,' &s;ays &s;he, 'how &s;hould I have imagined that a Lady of your Fa&s;hion would appear in &s;uch a Dre&s;s? I am &s;ure, Madam, if I had once &s;u&s;pected that your Lady&s;hip was your Lady&s;hip, I would &s;ooner have burnt my Tongue out, than have &s;aid what I have &s;aid: And I hope your Lady&s;hip will accept of a Gown, till you can get your own Cloaths.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Prithee Woman,' &s;ays Mrs. <HI>Waters,</HI> 'cea&s;e your Impertinence: How can you imagine I &s;hould con|cern my&s;elf about any thing which comes from the Lips of &s;uch low Creatures as your&s;elf. But I am &s;urprized at your A&s;&s;urance in thinking, after what is pa&s;t, that I will conde&s;cend to put on any of your dirty Things. I would have you know, Creature, I have a Spirit above that.'</Q></P>
<P>Here <HI>Jones</HI> interfered, and begg'd Mrs. <HI>Waters</HI> to forgive the Landlady, and to accept her Gown: <Q REND="inline">'For I mu&s;t confe&s;s,' cries he, 'our Appearance was a little &s;u&s;picious when fir&s;t we came in; and I am well a&s;&s;ured, all this good Woman did, was, as &s;he profe&s;&s;ed, out of Regard to the Reputation of her Hou&s;e.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Yes, upon my truly was it,' &s;ays &s;he; 'the Gen|tleman &s;peaks very much like a Gentleman, and I &s;ee very plainly is &s;o; and to be certain the Hou&s;e is well known to be a Hou&s;e of as good Reputati|on as any on the Road, and tho' I &s;ay it, is frequent|ed by Gentry of the be&s;t Quality, both <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> I defy any Body to &s;ay black is my Eye, for that Matter. And, as I was &s;aying, if I had known your Lady&s;hip to be your Lady&s;hip, I would as &s;oon have burnt my Fingers as have affronted

your Lady&s;hip; but truly where Gentry come and &s;pend their Money, I am not willing that they &s;hould be &s;candalized by a Set of poor &s;habby Ver|min, that wherever they go, leave more Lice than Money bebind them; &s;uch Folks never rai&s;e my Compa&s;&s;ion: For to be certain, it is fooli&s;h to have any for them, and if our Ju&s;tices did as they ought, they would be all whipt out of the Kingdom; for to be certain it is what is mo&s;t fitting for them. But as for your Lady&s;hip, I am heartily &s;orry your La|dy&s;hip hath had a Misfortune, and if your Lady&s;hip will do me the Honour to wear my Cloaths till you can get &s;ome of your Lady&s;hip's own, to be certain the be&s;t I have is at your Lady&s;hip's Service.'</Q></P>
<P>Whether Cold, Shame, or the Per&s;ua&s;ions of Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> prevailed mo&s;t with Mrs. <HI>Waters,</HI> I will not determine; but &s;he &s;uffered her&s;elf to be pacified by this Speech of my Landlady, and retired with that good Woman, in order to apparel her&s;elf in a decent Manner.</P>
<P>My Landlord was likewi&s;e beginning his Oration to <HI>Jones,</HI> but was pre&s;ently interrupted by that gene|rous Youth, who &s;hook him heartily by the Hand; and a&s;&s;ured him of entire Forgivene&s;s, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">'If you are &s;atisfied, my worthy Friend, I promi&s;e you I am;'</Q> and indeed in one Sen&s;e the Landlord had the better Rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied; for he had received a Bellyfull of Drubbing, whereas <HI>Jones</HI> had &s;carce felt a &s;ingle Blow.</P>
<P><HI>Partridge,</HI> who had been all this Time wa&s;hing his bloody No&s;e at the Pump, returned into the Kitch|en at the In&s;tant when his Ma&s;ter and the Landlord were &s;haking Hands with each other. As he was of a peaceable Di&s;po&s;ition, he was plea&s;ed with tho&s;e Symptoms of Reconciliation; and tho' his Face bore &s;ome Marks of <HI>Su&s;an</HI>'s Fi&s;t, and many more of her Nails, he rather cho&s;e to be contented with his For|tune
<PB N="209" REF="218">
in the la&s;t Battle, than to endeavour at better|ing it in another.</P>
<P>The heroic <HI>Su&s;an</HI> was likewi&s;e well contented with her Victory, tho' it had co&s;t her a Black-Eye, which <HI>Partridge</HI> had given her at the fir&s;t On&s;et. Between the&s;e two, therefore, a League was &s;truck, and tho&s;e Hands which had been the In&s;truments of War, be|came now the Mediators of Peace.</P>
<P>Matters were thus re&s;tored to a perfect Calm, at which the Serjeant, tho' it may &s;eem &s;o contrary to the Principles of his Profe&s;&s;ion, te&s;tified his Approba|tion. <Q REND="inline">'Why now, that's friendly, &s;aid he; D&mdash;n me, I hate to &s;ee two People bear Illwill to one another, after they have had a Tu&s;&s;el. The only Way when Friends quarrel, is to &s;ee it out fairly in a friendly Manner, as a Man may call it, either with Fi&s;t, or Sword, or Pi&s;tol, according as they like, and then let it be all over: For my own Part, d&mdash;n me if ever I love my Friend better than when I am fighting with him. To bear Malice is more like a <HI>Frenchman</HI> than an <HI>Engli&s;hman.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P>He then propo&s;ed a Libation as a nece&s;&s;ary Part of the Ceremony at all Treaties of that Kind. Perhaps the Reader may here conclude that he was well ver&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n antient Hi&s;tory; but this, tho' highly probable, as he cited no Authority to &s;upport the Cu&s;tom, I will not affirm with any Confidence. Mo&s;t likely indeed it is, that he founded his Opinion on very good Au|thority, &s;ince he confirmed it with many violent Oaths.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> no &s;ooner heard the Propo&s;al, than immedi|ately agreeing with the learned Serjeant, he ordered a Bowl, or rather a large Mug, filled with the Liquor u&s;ed on the&s;e Occa&s;ions to be brought in, and then began the Ceremony him&s;elf. He placed his Right Hand in that of the Landlord, and &s;eizing the Bowl with his Left, uttered the u&s;ual Words, and then made his Libation. After which the &s;ame was ob&s;erved by

Three Pounds at lea&s;t of that Fle&s;h which formerly had contributed to the Compo|&s;ition of an Ox, was now honoured with becoming Part of the individual Mr. <HI>Jones.</HI></P>
<P>This Particular we thought our&s;elves obliged to mention, as it may account for our Heroe's tempo|rary Neglect of his fair Companion; who eat but very little, and was indeed employed in con&s;iderations of a very different Nature, which pa&s;&s;ed unob&s;erved by <HI>Jones,</HI> till he had entirely &s;atisfied that Appetite which a Fa&s;t of twenty-four Hours had procured him; but
<PB N="212" REF="221">
his Dinner was no &s;ooner ended, than his Attention to other Matters revived; with the&s;e Matters there|fore we &s;hall now proceed to acquaint the Reader.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> of who&s;e per&s;onal Accompli&s;hment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> we have hitherto &s;aid very little, was in reality, one of the hand&s;ome&s;t young Fellows in the World. Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Face, be&s;ides being the Picture of Health, had in i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the mo&s;t apparent Marks of Sweetne&s;s and Good-na+ture. The&s;e Qualities were indeed &s;o characteri&s;tica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> in his Countenance, that while the Spirit and Sen&s;i|bility in his Eyes, tho' they mu&s;t have been perceived by an accurate Ob&s;erver, might have e&s;caped the No|tice of the le&s;s di&s;cerning, &s;o &s;trongly was this Good|nature painted in his Look, that it was remarked by almo&s;t every one who &s;aw him.</P>
<P>It was, perhaps, as much owing to this, as to a very fine Complection, that his Face had a Delicacy in it almo&s;t inexpre&s;&s;ible, and which might have given him an Air rather too effeminate, had it not been joined to a mo&s;t ma&s;culine Per&s;on and Mein; which latter had as much in them of the <HI>Hercules,</HI> as the for|mer had of the <HI>Adonis.</HI> He was be&s;ides active, gen|teel, gay and good humoured, and had a Flow o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Animal Spirits, which enlivened every Conver&s;ation where he was pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>When the Reader hath duly reflected on the&s;e many Charms which all centered in our Heroe, and con&s;i|ders at the &s;ame Time the fre&s;h Obligations which Mrs. <HI>Waters</HI> had to him, it will be a Mark of more Prudery than Candour to entertain a bad Opinion o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> her, becau&s;e &s;he conceived a very good Opinion o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> him.</P>

Mrs. <HI>Waters</HI> had, in Truth, not only a good Opinion of our Heroe, but a very great Affection for him.

An antient Heathen would perhaps have imputed this Di&s;ability to the God of Drink, no le&s;s than to the God of War; for, in Reality, both the Combatants had &s;acrificed as well to the former Deity as to the latter. To &s;peak plainly, they were both dead drunk, nor was <HI>Partridge</HI> in a much better Situation. As for my Landlord, drinking was his Trade, and the Liquor had no more Effect on him, than it had on any other Ve&s;&s;el in his Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Inn being &s;ummoned to attend Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> and his Companion, at their Tea, gave a full Relation of the latter Part of the foregoing Scene;
<PB N="222" REF="231">
and at the &s;ame Time expre&s;&s;ed great Concern for the young Lady, 'who,' &s;he &s;aid,' was under the ut|mo&s;t Unea&s;ine&s;s at being prevented from pur&s;uing her Journey. <Q REND="inline">'She is a &s;weet pretty Creature,' added &s;he, 'and I am certain I have &s;een her Face before. I fancy &s;he is in Love, and running away from her Friends. Who knows but &s;ome young Gentleman or other may be expecting her, with a Heart as hea|vy as her own.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> fetched a hearty Sigh at tho&s;e Words; of which, tho' Mrs. <HI>Waters</HI> ob&s;erved it, &s;he took no Notice while the Landlady continued in the Room; but after the Departure of that good Woman, &s;he could not forbear giving our Heroe certain Hints of her &s;u&s;pecting &s;ome very dangerous Rival in his Af|fections. The aukward Behaviour of Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> on this Occa&s;ion convinced her of the Truth, without his giving her a direct An&s;wer to any of her Que&s;tions; but &s;he was not nice enough in her Amours to be greatly concerned at the Di&s;covery. The Beau|ty of <HI>Jones</HI> highly charmed her Eye; but, as &s;he could not &s;ee his Heart, &s;he gave her&s;elf no concern about it. She could fea&s;t heartily at the Table of Love, without reflecting that &s;ome other already had been, or hereafter might be, fea&s;ted with the &s;ame Repa&s;t. A Sentiment which, if it deals but little in Refinement, deals however much in Sub&s;tance; and is le&s;s capricious, and perhaps le&s;s ill-natured and &s;el|fi&s;h than the De&s;ires of tho&s;e Females who can be contented enough to ab&s;tain from the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Lovers, provided they are &s;ufficiently &s;atisfied that no one el&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. <HI>Containing a fuller Account of Mrs.</HI> Waters, <HI>and by what Means &s;he came into that di&s;tre&s;sful Situation from which &s;he was re&s;cued by</HI> Jones.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH Nature hath by no Means mixed up an equal Share either of Curio&s;ity or Vanity in every human Compo&s;ition, there is perhaps no In|dividual to whom &s;he hath not allotted &s;uch a Propor|tion of both, as requires much Art and Pains too, to &s;ubdue and keep under. A Conque&s;t, however, ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to every one who would in any De|gree de&s;erve the Characters of Wi&s;dom or Good-Breeding.</P>
<P>As <HI>Jones</HI> therefore might very ju&s;tly be called a well-bred Man, he had &s;tifled all that Curio&s;ity which the extraordinary Manner in which he had found Mrs. <HI>Waters,</HI> mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to have occa&s;ioned. He had indeed at fir&s;t thrown out &s;ome few Hints to the Lady; but when he perceived her indu&s;triou&s;ly avoid|ing any Explanation, he was contented to remain in Ignorance, the rather as he was not without Su&s;pi|cion, that there were &s;ome Circum&s;tances which mu&s;t have rai&s;ed her Blu&s;hes, had &s;he related the whole Truth.</P>
<P>Now, &s;ince it is po&s;&s;ible that &s;ome of our Readers may not &s;o ea&s;ily acquie&s;ce under the &s;ame Ignorance, and as we are very de&s;irous to &s;atisfy them all, we have taken uncommon Pains to inform our&s;elves of the real Fact, with the Relation of which we &s;hall conclude this Book.</P>
<P>This Lady then had lived &s;ome Years with one Captain <HI>Waters,</HI> who was a Captain in the &s;ame Regiment to which Mr. <HI>Northerton</HI> belonged. She pa&s;t for that Gentleman's Wife, and went by his Name; and yet, as the Serjeant &s;aid, there were
<PB N="224" REF="233">
&s;ome Doubts concerning the Reality of their Marri|age, which we &s;hall not at pre&s;ent take upon us to re|&s;olve.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Waters,</HI> I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, had for &s;ome Time contracted an Intimacy with the above mention|ed En&s;ign, which did no great Credit to her Reputa|tion. That &s;he had a remakable Fondne&s;s for that young Fellow is mo&s;t certain; but whether &s;he in|dulged this to any very criminal Lengths, is not &s;o extremely clear, unle&s;s we will &s;uppo&s;e that Women never grant every Favour to a Man but one, without granting him that one al&s;o.</P>
<P>The Divi&s;ion of the Regiment to which Captain <HI>Waters</HI> belonged, had two Days preceded the March of that Company to which Mr. <HI>Northerton</HI> was the En&s;ign; &s;o that the former had reached <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> the very Day after the unfortunate Rencounter be|tween <HI>Jones</HI> and <HI>Northerton,</HI> which we have before recorded.</P>
<P>Now it had been agreed between Mrs. <HI>Waters</HI> and the Captain, that &s;he &s;hould accompany him in his March as far as <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> where they were to take their Leave of each other, and &s;he was thence to return to <HI>Bath,</HI> where &s;he was to &s;tay till the End of the Winter's Campaign again&s;t the Rebels.</P>
<P>With this Agreement Mr. <HI>Northerton</HI> was made acquainted. To &s;ay the Truth, the Lady had made him an A&s;&s;ignation at this very Place, and promi&s;ed to &s;tay at <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> till his Divi&s;ion came thither; with what View, and for that Purpo&s;e mu&s;t be left to the Reader's Divination: For though we are obliged to relate Facts, we are not obliged to do a Violence to our Nature by any Comments to the Di&s;advantage of the lovelie&s;t Part of the Creation.</P>
<P><HI>Northerton</HI> no &s;ooner obtained a Relea&s;e from his Captivity, as we have &s;een, than he ha&s;ted away to overtake Mrs. <HI>Waters;</HI> which, as he was a very ac|tive
<PB N="225" REF="234">
nimble Fellow, he did at the la&s;t mentioned City, &s;ome few Hours after Captain <HI>Waters</HI> had left her: At his fir&s;t Arrival he made no &s;cruple of acquainting her with the unfortunate Accident, which he made ap|pear very unfortunate indeed: For he totally extracted every Particle of what could be called Fault, at lea&s;t in a Court of Honour, though he left &s;ome Cir|cum&s;tances which might be que&s;tionable in a Court of Law.</P>
<P>Women, to their Glory be it &s;poken, are more generally capable of that violent and apparently di&s;inte|re&s;ted Pa&s;&s;ion of Love, which &s;eeks only the Good of its Object, than Men. Mrs. <HI>Waters,</HI> therefore, was no &s;ooner apprized of the Danger to which her Lover was expo&s;ed, than &s;he lo&s;t every Con&s;idera|tion be&s;ides that of his Safety; and this being a Matter equally agreeable to the Gentleman, it be|came the immediate Subject of Debate between them.</P>
<P>After much Con&s;ultation on this Matter, it was at length agreed, that the En&s;ign &s;hould go a-cro&s;s the Country to <HI>Hereford,</HI> whence he might find &s;ome Conveyance to one of the Sea-Ports in <HI>Wales,</HI> and thence might make his E&s;cape abroad. In all which Expedition Mrs. <HI>Waters</HI> declared &s;he would bear him Company; and for which &s;he was able to fur|ni&s;h him with Money, a very material Article to Mr. <HI>Northerton,</HI> &s;he having then in her Pocket three Bank Notes to the Amount of <HI>90l.</HI> be&s;ides &s;ome Ca&s;h, and a Diamond Ring of pretty con&s;iderable Value on her Finger. All which &s;he, with the utmo&s;t Confi|dence, revealed to this wicked Man, little &s;u&s;pecting &s;he &s;hould by the&s;e Means in&s;pire him with a De&s;ign of robbing her. Now as they mu&s;t, by taking Hor|&s;es from <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> have furni&s;hed any Pur&s;uers with the Means of hereafter di&s;covering their Rout, the En&s;ign propo&s;ed, and the Lady pre&s;ently agreed to make their fir&s;t Stage on Foot; for which Purpo&s;e the Hardne&s;s of the Fro&s;t was very &s;ea&s;onable.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="235">
The main Part of the Lady's Baggage was al|ready at <HI>Bath,</HI> and &s;he had nothing with her at pre|&s;ent be&s;ides a very &s;mall Quantity of Linnen, which the Gallant undertook to carry in his own Pockets. All Things, therefore, being &s;ettled in the Evening, they aro&s;e early the next Morning, and at Five o'Clock departed from <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> it being then above two Hours before Day. But the Moon which was then at the full, gave them all the Light &s;he was capable of affording.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Waters</HI> was not of that delicate Race of Wo|men who are obliged to the Invention of Vehicles for the Capacity of removing them&s;elves from one Place to another, and with whom con&s;equently a Coach is reckoned among the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life. Her Limbs were indeed full of Strength and Agility, and as her Mind was no le&s;s animated with Spirit, &s;he was per|fectly able to keep Pace with her nimble Lover.</P>
<P>Having travelled on for &s;ome Miles in a High Road, which <HI>Northerton</HI> &s;aid he was informed led to <HI>Here|ford,</HI> they came at the Break of Day to the Side of a large Wood, where he &s;uddenly &s;topped, and af|fecting to meditate a Moment with him&s;elf, expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome Apprehen&s;ions from travelling any longer in &s;o public a Way. Upon which he ea&s;ily per&s;uaded his fair Companion to &s;trike with him into a Path which &s;eemed to lead directly through the Wood, and which at length brought them both to the Bottom of <HI>Ma|zard-Hill.</HI></P>
<P>Whether the execrable Scheme which he now at|tempted to execute, was the Effect of previous De|liberation, or whether it now fir&s;t came into his Head, I cannot determine. But being arrived in this lone|ly Place, where it was very improbable he &s;hould meet with any Interruption; he &s;uddenly &s;lipped his Garter from his Leg, and laying violent Hands on the poor Woman, endeavoured to perpetrate that
<PB N="227" REF="236">
dreadful and dete&s;table Fact, which we have before commemorated, and which the providential Appear|ance of <HI>Jones</HI> did &s;o fortunately prevent.</P>
<P>Happy was it for Mrs. <HI>Waters,</HI> that &s;he was not of the weake&s;t Order of Females; for no &s;ooner did &s;he perceive by his tying a Knot in his Garter, and by his Declarations, what his Helli&s;h Intentions were, than &s;he &s;tood &s;toutly to her Defence, and &s;o &s;trong|ly &s;truggled with her Enemy, &s;creaming all the while for A&s;&s;i&s;tance, that &s;he delayed the Execution of the Villain's Purpo&s;e &s;everal Minutes, by which Means Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> came to her Relief, at that very In&s;tant when her Strength failed, and &s;he was totally over|powered, and delivered her from the Ruffian's Hands, with no other Lo&s;s than that of her Cloaths, which were torn from her Back, and of the Diamond Ring, which during the Contention either dropped from her Finger, or was wrenched from it by <HI>Nor|therton.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, Reader, we have given thee the Fruits of a very painful Enquiry, which for thy Satisfaction we have made into this Matter. And here we have open|ed to thee a Scene of Folly, as well as Villainy, which we could &s;carce have believed a human Creature ca|pable of being guilty of; had we not remembered that this Fellow was at that Time firmly per&s;uaded, that he had already committed a Murther, and had forfeited his Life to the Law. As he concluded therefore that his only Safety lay in Flight, he thought the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing him&s;elf of this poor Woman's Money and Ring would make him Amends for the additional Burthen he was to lay on his Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>And here, Reader, we mu&s;t &s;trictly caution thee, that thou do&s;t not take any Occa&s;ion from the Mi&s;be|haviour of &s;uch a Wretch as this, to reflect on &s;o worthy and honourable a Body of Men, as are the Officers of our Army in general. Thou wilt be
<PB N="228" REF="237">
plea&s;ed to con&s;ider, that this Fellow, as we have al|ready informed thee, had neither the Birth nor Edu|cation of a Gentleman, nor was a proper Per&s;on to be enrolled among the Number of &s;uch. If therefore his Ba&s;ene&s;s can ju&s;tly reflect on any be&s;ides him|&s;elf, it mu&s;t be only on tho&s;e who gave him his Com|mi&s;&s;ion.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Containing In&s;tructions very nece&s;&s;ary to be peru&s;ed by modern Critics.</HI></HEAD>
<P>READER, it is impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hould know what Sort of Per&s;on thou wilt be: For, perhaps, thou may'&s;t be as learned in Hu|man Nature as <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> him&s;elf was, and, perhaps, thou may'&s;t be no wi&s;er than &s;ome of his Editors. Now, le&s;t this latter &s;hould be the Ca&s;e, we think proper, before we go any farther together, to give thee a few whole&s;ome Admonitions; that thou may'&s;t not as gro&s;ly mi&s;under&s;tand and mi&s;re|pre&s;ent us, as &s;ome of the &s;aid Editors have mi&s;un|der&s;tood and mi&s;repre&s;ented their Author.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, then, we warn the not too ha&s;tily to condemn any of the Incidents in this our Hi&s;tory, as imperti|nent
<PB N="230" REF="239">
and foreign to our main De&s;ign, becau&s;e thou do&s;t not immediately conceive in what Manner &s;uch Incident may conduce to that De&s;ign. This Work may, indeed, be con&s;idered as a great Creation of our own; and for a little Reptile of a Critic to pre&s;ume to find Fault with any of its Parts, without knowing the Manner in which the Whole is connected, and be|fore he comes to the final Cata&s;trophe, is a mo&s;t pre|&s;umptuous Ab&s;urdity. The Allu&s;ion and Metaphor we have here made u&s;e of, we mu&s;t acknowledge to be infinitely too great for our Occa&s;ion, but there is, in|deed, no other, which is at all adequate to expre&s;s the Difference between an Author of the fir&s;t Rate and a Critic of the lowe&s;t.</P>
<P>Another Caution we mu&s;t give thee, my good Rep|tile, is, that thou do&s;t not find out too near a Re&s;em|blance between certain Characters here introduced; as for in&s;tance, between the Landlady who appears in the Seventh Book, and her in the Ninth. Thou art to know, Friend, that there are certain Charac|teri&s;tics, in which mo&s;t Individuals of every Profe&s;&s;ion and Occupation agree. To be able to pre&s;erve the&s;e Characteri&s;tics, and at the &s;ame Time to diver&s;ity their Operations, is one Talent of a good Writer. Again, to mark the nice Di&s;tinction between two Per|&s;ons actuated by the &s;ame Vice or Folly is another; and as this la&s;t Talent is found in very few Writers, &s;o is the true Di&s;cernment of it found in as few Rea|ders; though, I believe the Ob&s;ervation of this forms a very principal Plea&s;ure in tho&s;e who are capable of the Di&s;covery: Every Per&s;on, for In&s;tance, can di&s;|tingui&s;h between Sir <HI>Epicure Mammon,</HI> and Sir <HI>Fop|ling Flutter;</HI> but to know the Difference between Sir <HI>Fopling Flutter</HI> and Sir <HI>Courtly Nice,</HI> requires a more exqui&s;ite Judgment: For want of which, vulgar Spec|tators of Plays very often do great Inju&s;tice in the Theatre; where I have &s;ometimes known a Poet in Danger of being convicted as a Thief, upon much
<PB N="231" REF="240">
wor&s;e Evidence than the Re&s;emblance of Hands hath been held to be in the Law. In reality, I apprehend every amorous Widow on the Stage would run the Hazard of being condemned as a &s;ervile Imitation of <HI>Dido,</HI> but that happily very few of our Play-hou&s;e Critics under&s;tand enough of <HI>Latin</HI> to read <HI>Virgil.</HI></P>
<P>In the next place, we mu&s;t admoni&s;h thee, my wor|thy Friend, (for perhaps, thy Heart may be better than thy Head) not to condemn a Character as a bad one, becau&s;e it is not perfectly a good one. If thou do&s;t delight in the&s;e models of Perfection, there are Books enow written to gratify thy Ta&s;te; but as we have not, in the Cour&s;e of our Conver&s;ation, ever hap|pened to meet with any &s;uch Per&s;on, we have not cho|&s;en to introduce any &s;uch here. To &s;ay the Truth, I a little que&s;tion whether mere Man ever arrived at this con&s;ummate Degree of Excellence, as well as whether there hath ever exi&s;ted a Mon&s;ter bad enough to veri|fy that</P>
<Q><L><HI>&mdash;nulla virtute redemptum</HI></L>
<L><HI>A vitiis&mdash;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Who&s;e Vices are not allayed with a &s;ingle Virtue.</NOTE></L></Q>
<P>in <HI>Juvenal:</HI> Nor do I, indeed, conceive the good Purpo&s;es &s;erved by in&s;erting Characters of &s;uch an|gelic Perfection, or &s;uch diabolical Depravity, in any Work of Invention: Since from contemplating ei|ther, the Mind of Man is more likely to be over|whelmed with Sorrow and Shame, than to draw any good U&s;es from &s;uch Patterns; for in the former In|&s;tance he may be both concerned and a&s;hamed to &s;ee a Pattern of Excellence, in his Nature, which he may rea&s;onably de&s;pair of ever arriving at; and in con|templating the latter, he may be no le&s;s affected with tho&s;e unea&s;y Sen&s;ations, at &s;eeing the Nature, of which he is a Partaker, degraded into &s;o odious and dete&s;table a Creature.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="241">
In Fact, if there be enough of Goodne&s;s in a Cha|racter to engage the Admiration and Affection of a well-di&s;po&s;ed Mind, though there &s;hould appear &s;ome of tho&s;e little Blemi&s;hes, <HI>quas humana parum cavit na|tura,</HI> they will rai&s;e our Compa&s;&s;ion rather than our Abhorrence. Indeed, nothing can be of more moral U&s;e than the Imperfections which are &s;een in Exam|ples of this Kind; &s;ince &s;uch form a Kind of Surprize, more apt to affect and dwell upon our Minds, than the Faults of very vicious and wicked Per&s;ons. The Foibles and Vices of Men, in whom there is great Mixture of Good, become more glaring Objects, from the Virtues which contra&s;t them, and which &s;hew their Deformity; and when we find &s;uch Vices at|tended with their evil Con&s;equence to our favourite Characters, we are not only taught to &s;hun them for our own Sake, but to hate them for the Mi&s;chiefs they have already brought on tho&s;e we love.</P>
<P>And now, my Friend, having given you the&s;e few Admonitions, we will, if you plea&s;e, once more &s;et forward with our Hi&s;tory.</P>

<P>In this Po&s;ture were Affairs at the Inn, when a Gentleman arrived there Po&s;t. He immediately a|lighted from his Hor&s;e, and coming up to <HI>Su&s;an,</HI> enquir|ed of her in a very abrupt and confu&s;ed Manner, being almo&s;t out of Breath with Eagerne&s;s, whether there was any Lady in the Hou&s;e. The Hour of Night, and the Behaviour of the Man, who &s;tared very wildly all the Time, a little &s;urprized <HI>Su&s;an,</HI> &s;o that &s;he he|&s;itated before &s;he made any An&s;wer: Upon which the Gentleman, with redoubled Eagerne&s;s, begg'd her to give him a true Information, &s;aying, he had lo&s;t his 'Wife, and was come in Pur&s;uit of her. <Q REND="inline">'Upon my Shoul,' cries he, 'I have been near catching her already in two or three Places, if I had not found her gone ju&s;t as I came up with her.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'If &s;he be in the Hou&s;e, do carry me up in the Dark and &s;hew her to me; and if &s;he be gone a|way before me, do tell me which Way I &s;hall go after her to meet her, and upon my Shoul, I will make you the riche&s;t poor Woman in the Nation.'</Q> He then pulled out a Handful of Guineas, a Sight which would have bribed Per&s;ons of much greater Con&s;equence than this poor Wench, to much wor&s;e Purpo&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>Su&s;an,</HI> from the Account &s;he had received of Mrs. <HI>Waters,</HI> made not the lea&s;t Doubt but that &s;he was the very identical Stray whom the right owner pur&s;ued.

<P>It hath been a Cu&s;tom long e&s;tabli&s;hed in the polite World, and that upon very &s;olid and &s;ub&s;tantial Rea|&s;ons, that a Hu&s;band &s;hall never enter his Wife's A|partment without fir&s;t knocking at the Door. The many excellent U&s;es of this Cu&s;tom need &s;carce be hinted to a Reader who hath any Knowledge of the World: For by this Means the Lady hath Time to adju&s;t her&s;elf, or to remove any di&s;agreeable Object out of the Way; for there are &s;ome Situations, in which nice and delicate Women would not be di&s;co|vered by their Hu&s;bands.</P>
<P>To &s;ay the Truth, there are &s;everal Ceremonies in&s;tituted among the poli&s;hed Part of Mankind, which tho' they may, to coar&s;er Judgments, appear as Mat|ters of mere Form, are found to have much of Sub|&s;tance in them, by the more di&s;cerning; and lucky would it have been, had the Cu&s;tom abovementioned been ob&s;erved by our Gentleman in the pre&s;ent In|&s;tance. Knock, indeed, he did at the Door, but not with one of tho&s;e gentle Raps which is u&s;ual on &s;uch Occa&s;ions. On the contrary, when he found the Door locked, he flew at it with &s;uch Violence, that the Lock immediately gave Way, the Door bur&s;t open, and he fell headlong into the Room.</P>

<P>When that good Woman returned, the Conver&s;a|tion in the Kitchen was all upon the Charms of the young Lady.

<P>THE Lady had no &s;ooner laid her&s;elf on her Pil|low, than the Waiting-woman returned to the Kitchen to regale with &s;ome of tho&s;e Dainties which her Mi&s;tre&s;s had refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Company at her Entrance, &s;hewed her the &s;ame Re&s;pect which they had before paid to her Mi&s;tre&s;s, by ri&s;ing; but &s;he forgot to imitate her, by de&s;iring them to &s;it down again.

<P>Mrs. <HI>Honour</HI> had no &s;ooner left the Kitchen in the Manner we have before &s;een, than the Landlady fell &s;everely upon her.

While they were thus di&s;cour&s;ing, Mrs. <HI>Honour</HI> re|turned, and di&s;charged her Commi&s;&s;ion, by bidding the Landlady immediately awake Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> and tell him a Lady wanted to &s;peak with him.

<P>The Spirits of <HI>Sophia</HI> were too much di&s;&s;ipated by Concern to enable her to &s;top the Torrent of her

<P>To &s;ay the Truth, this Behaviour of <HI>Partridge</HI> was a little inexcu&s;able; but he had not &s;lept off the Effect of the Do&s;e which he &s;wallowed the Evening before; which had in the Morning, received the Addi|tion of about a Pint of Wine, or indeed rather of Malt Spirits; for the Perry was by no Means pure. Now that Part of his Head which Nature de&s;igned for the Re&s;ervoir of Drink, being very &s;hallow, a &s;mall Quantity of Liquor overflowed it, and opened the Sluices of his Heart; &s;o that all the Secrets there de|po&s;ited run out. The&s;e Sluices were indeed naturally very ill &s;ecured. To give the be&s;t natured Turn we can to his di&s;po&s;ition, he was a very hone&s;t Man: for as he was the mo&s;t inqui&s;itive of Mortals, and eter|nally prying into the Secrets of others, &s;o he very faithfully paid them by communicating, in Return, every thing within his Knowledge.</P>
<P>While <HI>Sophia</HI> tormented with Anxiety, knew not what to believe, nor what Re&s;olution to take, <HI>Su&s;an</HI> arrived with the Sack-Whey.

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. <HI>Containing, among other Things, the Ingenuity of</HI> Par|tridge, <HI>the Madne&s;s of</HI> Jones, <HI>and the Folly of</HI> Fitzpatrick.</HEAD>
<P>IT was now pa&s;t Five in the Morning, and other Company began to ri&s;e and come to the Kitchen, among whom were the Serjeant and the Coachman, who being thoroughly reconciled, made a Libati|on, or, in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Phra&s;e, drank a hearty Cup together.</P>
<P>In this Drinking nothing more remarkable happen|ed, than the Behaviour of <HI>Partridge,</HI> who, when the Serjeant drank a Health to King <HI>George,</HI> repeated only the Word King: Nor could he be brought to utter more: For tho' he was going to &s;ight again&s;t his own Cau&s;e, yet he could not be prevailed upon to drink again&s;t it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> being now returned to his own Bed (but from whence we returned he mu&s;t beg to be excu&s;ed from relating) &s;ummoned <HI>Partridge</HI> from this agree|able Company, who, after a ceremonious Preface,
<PB N="256" REF="265">
having obtained leave to offer his Advice, delivered him&s;elf as follows:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'It is, Sir, an old Saying, and a true one, that a wi&s;e Man may &s;ometimes learn Council from a Fool; wi&s;h therefore I might be &s;o bold as to offer you my Advice, which is to return home again and leave the&s;e <HI>Horrida Bella,</HI> the&s;e bloody Wars to Fellows who are contented to &s;wallow Gunpowder, becau&s;e they have nothing to eat. Now every bo|dy knows your Honour wants for nothing at home; when that's the Ca&s;e, why &s;hould any Man travel abroad?'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>'Partridge,'</HI> cries <HI>Jones,</HI> 'thou art certainly a Coward, I wi&s;h therefore thou would'&s;t return home thy&s;elf, and trouble me no more.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'I a&s;k your Honour's Pardon,' cries <HI>Partridge,</HI> 'I &s;poke on your Account more than my own; for as to me, Heaven knows my Circum&s;tances are bad enough, and I am &s;o far from being afraid, that I value a Pi&s;tol, or a Blunderbu&s;s, or any &s;uch Thing, no more than a Pop-gun. Every Man mu&s;t die once, and what &s;ignifies the Manner how; be&s;ides, perhaps, I may come off with the Lo&s;s only of an Arm or a Leg. I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, I was never le&s;s afraid in my Life; and &s;o if your Honour is re&s;olved to go on, I am re&s;olved to fol|low you. But, in that Ca&s;e, I wi&s;h I might give my Opinion. To be &s;ure it is a &s;candalous Way of travelling, for a great Gentleman like you to walk afoot. Now here are two or three good Hor&s;es in the Stable, which the Landlord will certainly make no Scruple of tru&s;ting you with; but if he &s;hould, I can ea&s;ily contrive to take them, and let the wor&s;t come to the wor&s;t, the King would certainly par|don you, as you are going to fight in his Cau&s;e.'</Q></P>
<P>Now as the Hone&s;ty of <HI>Partridge</HI> was equal to his Under&s;tanding, and both dealt only in &s;mall Matters, he would never have attempted a Roguery of this
<PB N="257" REF="266">
Kind, had he not imagined it altogether &s;afe; for he was one of tho&s;e who have more con&s;ideration of the Gallows than of the Fitne&s;s of Things; but in Re|ality, he thought he might have committed this Felony without any Danger: For, be&s;ides that he doubted not but the Name of Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> would &s;ufficiently quiet the Landlord, he conceived they &s;hould be alto|gether &s;afe, whatever Turn Affairs might take; as <HI>Jones,</HI> he imagined, would have Friends enough on one Side, and as his Friends would as well &s;ecure him on the other.</P>
<P>When Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> found that <HI>Partridge</HI> was in ear|ne&s;t in this Propo&s;al, he very &s;everely rebuked him, and that in &s;uch bitter Terms that the other attempted to laugh it off, and pre&s;ently turned the Di&s;cour&s;e to other Matters, &s;aying, he believed they were then in a Bawdy-hou&s;e, and that he had with much ado pre|vented two Wenches from di&s;turbing his Honour in the middle of the Night. <Q REND="inline">'Heyday!' &s;ays he, 'I be|lieve they got into your Chamber whether I would or no, for here lies the Muff of one of them on the Ground.'</Q> Indeed, as <HI>Jones</HI> returned to his Bed in the Dark, he had never perceived the Muff on the Quilt, and in leaping into his Bed he had tumbled it on the Floor. This <HI>Partridge</HI> now took up, and was going to put into his Pocket, when <HI>Jones</HI> de&s;ired to &s;ee it. The Muff was &s;o very remarkable, that our Heroe might po&s;&s;ibly have recollected it without the Information annexed. But his Memory was not put to that hard Office, for at the &s;ame In&s;tant he &s;aw and read the Words <HI>Sophia We&s;tern</HI> upon the Paper which was pinned to it. His Looks now grew frantic in a Moment, and he eagerly cried out, <Q REND="inline">'Oh Heavens, how came this Muff here!' 'I know no more than your Honour,' cried <HI>Partridge;</HI> 'but I &s;aw it upon the Arm of one of the Women who would have di&s;|turbed you, if I would have &s;uffered them.' 'Where are they?'</Q> cries <HI>Jones,</HI> jumping out of Bed, and
<PB N="258" REF="267">
laying hold of his Clothes. <Q REND="inline">'Many Miles off, I be|lieve,' by this Time,'</Q> &s;aid <HI>Partridge.</HI> And now <HI>Jones,</HI> upon further Enquiry, was &s;ufficiently a&s;&s;ured that the Bearer of this Muff was no other than the lovely <HI>Sophia</HI> her&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Behaviour of <HI>Jones</HI> on this Occa&s;ion. His Thoughts, his Looks, his Words, his Actions, were &s;uch as <HI>Beggar all De&s;cription.</HI> After many bitter Execrations on <HI>Partridge,</HI> and not fewer on him&s;elf, he ordered the poor Fellow, who was frightened out of his Wits, to run down and hire him Hor&s;es at any rate; and a very few Minutes afterwards, having &s;huffled on his Clothes, he ha&s;tened down Stairs to execute the Orders him&s;elf, which he had ju&s;t before given.</P>
<P>But before we proceed to what pa&s;&s;ed on his Arri|val in the Kitchen, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to recur to what had there happened &s;ince <HI>Partridge</HI> had fir&s;t left it on his Ma&s;ter's Summons.</P>
<P>The Serjeant was ju&s;t marched off with his Party when the two <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Gentlemen aro&s;e and came down Stairs; both complaining, that they had been &s;o often waked by the Noi&s;es in the Inn, that they had never once been able to clo&s;e their Eyes all Night.</P>
<P>The Coach, which had brought the young Lady and her Maid, and which, perhaps, the Reader may have hitherto concluded was her own, was indeed a re|turned Coach belonging to Mr. <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Bath,</HI> one of the worthie&s;t and hone&s;te&s;t Men that ever dealt in Hor&s;e-fle&s;h, and who&s;e Coaches we heartily recom+mend to all our Readers who travel that Road. By which Means they may, perhaps, have the Plea&s;ure of riding in the very Coach, and being driven by the very Coachman, that is recorded in this Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The Coachman having but two Pa&s;&s;engers, and hearing Mr. <HI>Maclachlan</HI> was bound to <HI>Bath,</HI> offered to carry him thither at a very moderate Price. He was induced to this by the Report of the O&s;tler, who
<PB N="259" REF="268">
&s;aid, that the Hor&s;e which Mr. <HI>Maclachlan</HI> had hired <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rom <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> would be much more plea&s;ed with re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">rning to his Friend there, than to pro&s;ecute a long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ourney; for that the &s;aid Hor&s;e was rather a two|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">gged than a four-legged Animal.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Maclachlan</HI> immediately clo&s;ed with the Pro|po&s;al of the Coachman, and, at the &s;ame Time, per|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">aded his Friend <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> to accept of the fourth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lace in the Coach.

<P>Now it happens to this &s;ort of Men, as to bad <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ounds, who never hit off a Fault them&s;elves; but no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">oner doth a Dog of Sagacity open his Mouth, than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ey immediately do the &s;ame, and without the Guide <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> any Scent, run directly forwards as fa&s;t as they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">le. In the &s;ame Manner, the very Moment Mr. <HI>Maclachlan</HI> had mentioned his Apprehen&s;ion, Mr. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> in&s;tantly concurred, and flew directly up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">airs to &s;urprize his Wife before he knew where &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">as; and unluckily (as Fortune loves to play Tricks <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ith tho&s;e Gentlemen who put them&s;elves entirely un|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r her Conduct) ran his Head again&s;t &s;everal Doors <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">d Po&s;ts to no Purpo&s;e.

<P>This was not however the Ca&s;e at pre&s;ent; for af|ter a long fruitle&s;s Search, Mr. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> returned to the Kitchen, where, as if this had been a rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Chace, entered a Gentleman hallowing as Hunter do when the Hounds are at Fault.

<P>Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> and his Nephew were not known to one another; nor indeed would the former have tak|en any Notice of the latter, if he had known him; for this being a &s;tolen Match, and con&s;equently an unnatural one in the Opinion of the good Squire, he had, from the Time of her committing it, abandoned he poor young Creature, who was then no more than Eighteen, as a Mon&s;ter, and had never &s;ince &s;uffered her to be named in his Pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>The Kitchen was now a Scene of univer&s;al Con|fu&s;ion, <HI>We&s;tern</HI> enquiring after his Daughter, and <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> as eagerly after his Wife, when <HI>Jones</HI> en|tered the Room, unfortunately having <HI>Sophia</HI>'s Muff in his Hand.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as <HI>We&s;tern</HI> &s;aw <HI>Jones,</HI> he &s;et up the &s;ame Holla as is u&s;ed by Sport&s;men when their Game is in View.

<P><HI>Jones</HI> having, at length, &s;haken Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> off, and &s;ome of the Company having interfered between them, our Heroe prote&s;ted his Innocence as to know|ing any thing of the Lady; when Par&s;on <HI>Supple</HI> &s;tep|ped up, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'It is Folly to deny it; for why the Marks of Guilt are in thy Hands.

<P>So much more tenderly do Women value their Re+putation than their Per&s;ons, that tho' the latter &s;eem+ed now in more Danger than before, yet as the for+mer was &s;ecure, the Lady &s;creamed not with &s;uch Vi+olence as &s;he had done on the other Occa&s;ion.

<P>Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> now proceeded to &s;earch the whole Hou&s;e, but to as little Purpo&s;e as he had di&s;turbed poor Mrs. <HI>Waters.</HI> He then returned di&s;con&s;olate into the Kitchen, where he found <HI>Jones</HI> in the Cu&s;|tody of his Servants.</P>
<P>This violent Uproar had rai&s;ed all the People in the Hou&s;e; tho' it was yet &s;carcely Day-light.

And that he could not carry all the Law in his Head about &s;tealing away Daugh|ters, and &s;uch Sort of Things.</P>
<P>Here Mr. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> offered to lend him his A&s;&s;i&s;|tance; informing the Company that he had been him|&s;elf bred to the Law. (And indeed he had &s;erved three Years as Clerk to an Attorney in the North of <HI>Ireland,</HI> when chu&s;ing a genteeler Walk in Life, he quitted his Ma&s;ter, came over to <HI>England,</HI> and &s;et up that Bu&s;ine&s;s, which requires no Apprentice&s;hip, namely, that of a Gentleman, in which he had &s;ucceeded as hath been already partly mentioned.)</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> declared that the Law concerning Daughters was out of the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e; that &s;teal|ing a Muff was undoubtedly Felony, and the Goods being found upon the Per&s;on, were &s;ufficient Evidence of the Fact.</P>
<P>The Magi&s;trate, upon the Encouragement of &s;o learned a Coadjutor, and upon the violent Interce&s;|&s;ion of the Squire, was at length prevailed upon to &s;eat him&s;elf in the Chair of Ju&s;tice, where being placed, upon viewing the Muff which <HI>Jones</HI> &s;till held

in his Hand, and upon the Par&s;on's &s;wearing it to be the Property of Mr. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> he de&s;ired Mr. <HI>Fitzpa+trick</HI> to draw up a Commitment, which he &s;aid h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> would &s;ign.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> now de&s;ired to be heard, which was at la&s;t with Difficulty, granted him.

<P>BEFORE we proceed any farther in our Hi&s;tory, it may be proper to look a little back, in order account for the extraordinary Appearance of <HI>Sophia</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nd her Father at the Inn at <HI>Upton.</HI></P>
<P>The Reader may be plea&s;ed to remember, that in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e Ninth Chapter of the Seventh Book of our Hi&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ry, we left <HI>Sophia,</HI> after a long Debate between <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ove and Duty, deciding the Cau&s;e, as it u&s;ually, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">elieve, happens, in Favour of the Former.</P>
<P>This Debate had ari&s;en, as we have there &s;hewn, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">om a Vi&s;it which her Father had ju&s;t before made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r, in order to force her Con&s;ent to a Marriage with <HI>Blifil;</HI> and which he had under&s;tood to be fully im|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ied in her Acknowledgment, <HI>that &s;he neither mu&s;t, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> could refu&s;e any ab&s;olute Command of his.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="275">
Now from this Vi&s;it the Squire retired to his Even|ing Potation, overjoyed at the Succe&s;s he had had with his Daughter; and as he was of a &s;ocial Di&s;po&s;i|tion, and willing to have Partakers in his Happine&s;s, the Beer was ordered to flow very liberally into the Kitchen; &s;o that before Eleven in the Evening, there was not a &s;ingle Per&s;on &s;ober in the Hou&s;e, except on|ly Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> her&s;elf, and the charming <HI>Sophia.</HI></P>
<P>Early in the Morning a Me&s;&s;enger was di&s;patched to &s;ummon Mr. <HI>Blifil:</HI> For tho' the Squire imagined that young Gentleman had been much le&s;s acquainted than he really was, with the former Aver&s;ion of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Daughter; as he had not, however, yet received he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Con&s;ent, he longed impatiently to communicate it to him, not doubting but that the intended Bride her&s;elf would confirm it with her Lips.

<P>Breakfa&s;t was now &s;et forth in the Parlour, where Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI> attended, and where the Squire and his Si&s;ter likewi&s;e were a&s;&s;embled; and now <HI>Sophia</HI> was order+ed to be called.</P>
<P>O, <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> had I thy Pen!

<P>entered the Room, and declared,<HI>&mdash;That Madam</HI> So+phia <HI>was not be found.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><PB N="267" REF="276">
'Not to be found!' cries the Squire, &s;tarting from his Chair; 'Zounds and D&mdash;nation! Blood and Fury! Where, when, how, what,&mdash;Not to be found! where?'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'La! Brother,' &s;aid Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern,'</HI> with true poli|tical Coldne&s;s, 'you are always throwing your&s;elf in|to &s;uch violent Pa&s;&s;ions for nothing.

<P><Q REND="inline">'Nay, nay,' an&s;wered the Squire, returning as &s;uddenly to him&s;elf, as he had gone from him&s;elf; 'if that be all the Matter, it &s;ignifies not much; but, upon my Soul, my Mind mi&s;gave me, when the Fellow &s;aid &s;he was not to be found.'</Q> He then gave Orders for the Bell to be rung in the Garden, and &s;at him&s;elf contentedly down.</P>
<P>No two Things could be more the Rever&s;e of each other than were the Brother and Si&s;ter, in mo&s;t In|&s;tances; particularly in this, That as the Brother never fore&s;aw any Thing at a Di&s;tance, but was mo&s;t &s;agacious in immediately &s;eeing every Thing the Mo|ment it had happened; &s;o the Si&s;ter eternally fore&s;aw at a Di&s;tance, but was not &s;o quick-&s;ighted to Objects before her Eyes. Of both the&s;e the Reader may have ob&s;erved Examples: And, indeed, both their &s;everal Talents were exce&s;&s;ive: For as the Si&s;ter often fore|&s;aw what never came to pa&s;s, &s;o the Brother often &s;aw much more than was actually the Truth.</P>
<P>This was not however the Ca&s;e at pre&s;ent. The &s;ame Report was brought from the Garden, as before had been brought from the Chamber, that Madam <HI>Sophia</HI> was not to be found.</P>
<P>The Squire him&s;elf now &s;allied forth, and begun to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">oar forth the Name of <HI>Sophia</HI> as loudly, and in as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">oar&s;e a Voice, as whileom did <HI>Hercules</HI> that of <HI>Hylas:</HI> And as the Poet tells us, that the whole Shore eccho|ed back the Name of that beautiful Youth; &s;o did the

Hou&s;e, the Garden, and all the neighbouring Fields, re&s;ound nothing but the Name of <HI>Sophia,</HI> in the hoar&s;e Voice of the Men, and in the &s;hrill Pipes of the Wo|men; while Echo &s;eemed &s;o plea&s;ed to repeat the beloved Sound, that if there is really &s;uch a Per&s;on, I believe <HI>Ovid</HI> hath belied her Sex.</P>
<P>Nothing reigned for a long Time but Confu&s;ion; 'till at la&s;t the Squire having &s;ufficiently &s;pent his Breath, returned to the Parlour, where he found Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> and Mr. <HI>Blifil,</HI> and threw him&s;elf, with the utmo&s;t Dejection in his Countenance, into a great Chair.</P>
<P>Here Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> began to apply the following Con&s;olation:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Brother, I am &s;orry for what hath happened; and that my Niece &s;hould have behaved her&s;elf in a Manner &s;o unbecoming her Family; but it is all your own Doings, and you have no Body to thank but your&s;elf. You know &s;he hath been educated always in a Manner directly contrary to my Ad|vice, and now you &s;ee the Con&s;equence. Have I not a thou&s;and Times argued with you about giving my Niece her own Will? But you know I never could prevail upon you: And when I had taken &s;o much Pains to eradicate her head&s;trong Opinions, and to rectify your Errors in Policy, you know &s;he was taken out of my Hands; &s;o that I have nothing to an&s;wer for. Had I been tru&s;ted entirely with the Care of her Education, no &s;uch Accident as this had ever befallen you: So that you mu&s;t comfort your&s;elf by thinking it was all your own Doings; and, indeed, what el&s;e could be expected from &s;uch Indulgence?'&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Zounds! Si&s;ter,' an&s;wered he,' 'you are e|nough to make one mad. Have I indulged her? Have I given her her Will?&mdash;It was no longer ago than la&s;t night Night that I threatened, if &s;he di&s;|obeyed me, to confine her to her Chamber upon

How often have I advi&s;ed&mdash;</Q>'Here <HI>We&s;tern</HI> ro&s;e ha&s;tily from his Chair, and, venting two or three horrid Im|precations, ran out of the Room.</P>
<P>When he was departed, his Si&s;ter expre&s;&s;ed more Bitterne&s;s (if po&s;&s;ible) again&s;t him, than &s;he had done while he was pre&s;ent; for the Truth of which &s;he appealed to Mr. <HI>Blifil,</HI> who, with great Complai&s;ance, acquie&s;ced entirely in all &s;he &s;aid; but excu&s;ed all the faults of Mr. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> <Q REND="inline">'as they mu&s;t be con&s;idered,' he &s;aid, 'to have proceeded from the too inordinate Fondne&s;s of a Father, which mu&s;t be allowed the Name of an amiable Weakne&s;s.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'So much the

<P>Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> then began to expre&s;s great Confu&s;i|on on the Account of Mr. <HI>Blifil,</HI> and of the U&s;age<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> which he had received from a Family to which he in|tended &s;o much Honour.

<P>After much of this Kind of Conver&s;ation, which, perhaps, would not greatly entertain the Reader, was it here particularly related, Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI> took his Leave and returned home, not highly plea&s;ed with his Di&s;ap|pointment; which, however, the Philo&s;ophy which he had acquired from <HI>Square,</HI> and the Religion infu&s;ed into him by <HI>Thwackum,</HI> together with &s;omewhat el&s;e taught him to bear rather better than more pa&s;&s;ionate Lovers bear the&s;e Kinds of Evils.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. <HI>The E&s;cape of</HI> Sophia.</HEAD>
<P>IT is now Time to look after <HI>Sophia;</HI> whom the Reader, if he loves her half &s;o well as I do, will rejoice to find e&s;caped from the Clutches of her pa&s;+&s;ionate Father, and from tho&s;e of her di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate Lover.</P>
<P>Twelve Times did the iron Regi&s;ter of Time bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> on the &s;onorous Bell-metal, &s;ummoning the Gho&s;ts to ri&s;e, and walk their nightly Round.&mdash;In plaine Language, it was Twelve o' Clock, and all the Fa+mily, as we have &s;aid, lay buried in Drink and Sleep except only Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> who was deeply engaged in reading a political Pamphlet, and except our He|roine,
<PB N="271" REF="280">
who now &s;oftly &s;tole down Stairs, and hav|ing unbarred and unlocked one of the Hou&s;e Doors, &s;allied forth, and ha&s;tened to the Place of Appoint|ment.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the many pretty Arts, which La|dies &s;ometimes practi&s;e, to di&s;play their Fears on eve|ry little Occa&s;ion, (almo&s;t as many as the other Sex u&s;es to conceal theirs) certainly there is a Degree of Courage, which not only becomes a Woman, but is often nece&s;&s;ary to enable her to di&s;charge her Duty. It is, indeed, the Idea of Fiercene&s;s, and not of Bra|very, which de&s;troys the Female Character: For who can read the Story of the ju&s;tly celebrated <HI>Arria,</HI> without conceiving as high an Opinion of her Gentle|ne&s;s and Tenderne&s;s, as of her Fortitude? At the &s;ame Time, perhaps, many a Woman who &s;hrieks at a Mou&s;e, or a Rat, may be capable of poi&s;oning a Hu&s;band; or, what is wor&s;e, of driving him to poi|&s;on him&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia,</HI> with all the Gentlene&s;s which a Woman can have, had all the Spirit which &s;he ought to have. When, therefore, &s;he came to the Place of Appoint|ment, and in&s;tead of meeting her Maid, as was agreed, &s;aw a Man ride directly up to her, &s;he neither &s;cream|ed out, nor fainted away: Not that her Pul&s;e then beat with its u&s;ual Regularity; for &s;he was at fir&s;t, under &s;ome Surprize and Apprehen&s;ion: But the&s;e were relieved almo&s;t as &s;oon as rai&s;ed, when the Man pulling off his Hat, a&s;ked her, in a very &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Manner, <Q REND="inline">'If her Lady&s;hip did not expect to meet another Lady?' And then proceeded to inform her, that he was &s;ent to conduct her to that Lady.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> could have no po&s;&s;ible &s;u&s;picion of any Fal&s;|hood in this Account: She therefore mounted re&s;o|lutely behind the Fellow, who conveyed her &s;afe to a Town about Five Miles di&s;tant, where &s;he had the Satisfaction of finding the good Mrs. <HI>Honour:</HI> For as the Soul of the Waiting-woman was wrapt up in
<PB N="272" REF="281">
tho&s;e very Habiliments which u&s;ed to enwrap her Bo|dy, &s;he could by no Means bring her&s;elf to tru&s;t them out of her Sight. Upon the&s;e, therefore, &s;he kept Guard in Per&s;on, while &s;he detached the afore&s;aid Fellow after her Mi&s;tre&s;s, having given him all pro|per In&s;tructions.</P>
<P>They now debated what Cour&s;e to take, in order to avoid the Pur&s;uit of Mr. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> who, they knew, would &s;end after them in a few Hours. The <HI>Lon|don</HI> Road had &s;uch Charms for <HI>Honour,</HI> that &s;he was de&s;irous of going on directly; alledging, that as <HI>So|phia</HI> could not be mi&s;&s;ed till Eight or Nine the next Morning, her Pur&s;uers would not be able to overtake her, even though they knew which Way &s;he had gone. But <HI>Sophia</HI> had too much at Stake to venture any Thing to Chance; nor did &s;he dare to tru&s;t too much to her tender Limbs, in a Conte&s;t which was to be decided only by Swiftne&s;s. She re&s;olved therefore, to travel acro&s;s the Country, for at lea&s;t Twenty or Thirty Miles, and then to take the direct Road to <HI>London.</HI> So having hired her Hor&s;es to go Twenty Miles one Way, when &s;he intended to go Twenty Miles the other, &s;he &s;et forward with the &s;ame Guide, behind whom &s;he had ridden from her Father's Hou&s;e; the Guide having now taken up behind him, in the Room of <HI>Sophia,</HI> a much heavier, as well as much le&s;s lovely Burthen; being, indeed, a huge Portman|teau, well &s;tuffed with tho&s;e out&s;ide Ornaments, by Means of which the fair <HI>Honour</HI> hoped to gain many Conque&s;ts, and, finally, to make her Fortune in <HI>Lon|don</HI> City.</P>
<P>When they had gone about Two hundred Paces from the Inn, on the <HI>London</HI> Road, <HI>Sophia</HI> rode up to the Guide, and, with a Voice much fuller of Ho|ney than was ever that of <HI>Anacreon,</HI> though his Mouth is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been a Bee-hive, begged him to take the fir&s;t Turning which led towards <HI>Bri|&s;tol.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="282">
Reader, I am not &s;uper&s;titious, nor any great Be|liever in modern Miracles. I do not therefore, deliver the following as a certain Truth; for, indeed, I can &s;carce credit it my&s;elf: But the Fidelity of an Hi&s;tori|an obliges me to relate what hath been confidently a&s;|&s;erted. The Hor&s;e, then, on which the Guide rode, is reported to have been &s;o charmed by <HI>Sophia</HI>'s Voice, that he made a full Stop, and expre&s;t an Unwillingne&s;s to proceed any farther.</P>
<P>Perhaps, however, the Fact may be true, and le&s;s miraculous then it hath been repre&s;ented; &s;ince the natural Cau&s;e &s;eems adequate to the Effect: For as the Guide at that Moment de&s;i&s;ted from a con&s;tant Appli|cation of his armed right Heel, (for, like <HI>Hudibras,</HI> he wore but one Spur) it is more than po&s;&s;ible, that this Omi&s;&s;ion alone might occa&s;ion the Bea&s;t to &s;top, e&s;pecially as this was very frequent with him at other Times.</P>
<P>But if the Voice of <HI>Sophia</HI> had really an Effect on the Hor&s;e; it had very little on the Rider. He an|&s;wered &s;omewhat &s;urlily, <Q REND="inline">'That Mea&s;ter had ordered him to go a different Way, and that he &s;hould lo&s;e his Place, if he went any other than that he was ordered.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> finding all her Per&s;ua&s;ions had no Effect, be|gan now to add irre&s;i&s;tible Charms to her Voice; Charms, which according to the Proverb, makes the old Mare trot, in&s;tead of &s;tanding &s;till; Charms! to which modern Ages have attributed all that irre&s;i&s;tible Force, which the Ancients imputed to perfect Oratory. In a Word, &s;he promi&s;ed &s;he would reward him to his utmo&s;t Expectation.</P>
<P>The Lad was not totally deaf to the&s;e Promi&s;es; but he di&s;liked their being indefinite: For tho' perhaps he had never heard that Word, yet that in Fact was his Objection. <Q REND="inline">'He &s;aid, Gentlevolks did not con&s;ider the Ca&s;e of poor Volks; that he had like to have been turned away the other Day, for riding about the Coun|try

<P><Q REND="inline">'With whom? &s;ays <HI>Sophia</HI> eagerly&mdash;With a Gentleman from Squire <HI>Allworthy</HI>'s, repeated the Lad, 'the Squire's Son, I think, they call 'un.'&mdash;'Whither? which Way did he go? &s;ays <HI>Sophia.</HI> Why a little o' one Side o' <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> about twenty Miles off,'</Q> an&s;wered the Lad.&mdash;Guide me,' &s;ays <HI>Sophia</HI> <Q REND="inline">'to the &s;ame Place, and I'll give thee a Guinea, or two, if one is not &s;ufficient.' 'To be certain, &s;aid the Boy, it is hone&s;tly worth two, when your La|dy&s;hip con&s;iders what a Risk I run; but, however, if your Lady&s;hip will promi&s;e me the two Guineas, I'll e'en venture: To be certain it is a &s;inful Thing to ride about my Ma&s;ter's Hor&s;es; but one Com|fort is, I can only be turned away, and two Guineas will partly make me Amends.'</Q></P>
<P>The Bargain being thus &s;truck, the Lad turned a|&s;ide into the <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Road, and <HI>Sophia</HI> &s;et forward in Pur&s;uit of <HI>Jones,</HI> highly contrary to the Remon&s;tran|ces of Mrs. <HI>Honour,</HI> who had much more De&s;ire to &s;ee <HI>London,</HI> than to &s;ee Mr. <HI>Jones:</HI> For indeed &s;he was not his Friend with her Mi&s;tre&s;s, as he had been guilty of &s;ome Neglect in certain pecuniary Civilities, which are by Cu&s;tom due to the Waiting-gentlewo|man in all Love Affairs, and more e&s;pecially in tho&s;e of a clande&s;tine Kind. This we impute rather to the Carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of his Temper, than to any Want of Genero&s;ity; but perhaps &s;he derived it from the latter Motive. Certain it is that &s;he hated him very bitterly on that Account, and re&s;olved to take every Oppor|tunity of injuring him with her Mi&s;tre&s;s. It was therefore highly unlucky for her, that &s;he had gone to the very &s;ame Town and Inn whence <HI>Jones</HI> had &s;tarted and &s;till more unlucky was &s;he, in having &s;tumbled on the &s;ame Guide, and on this accidental Di&s;covery which <HI>Sophia</HI> had made.</P>

Our Travellers arrived at <HI>Hambrook</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was the Village where <HI>Jones</HI> met the Quaker.</NOTE> at the Break of Day, where <HI>Honour</HI> was again&s;t her Will charged to enquire the Rout which Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> had taken. Of this, indeed, the Guide him&s;elf could have informed them; but <HI>Sophia,</HI> I know not for what Rea&s;on, ne|ver a&s;ked him the Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>When Mrs. <HI>Honour</HI> had made her Report from the Landlord, <HI>Sophia,</HI> with much Difficulty, pro|cured &s;ome indifferent Hor&s;es, which brought her to the Inn, where <HI>Jones</HI> had been confined rather by the Misfortune of meeting with a Surgeon, than by hav|ing met with a broken Head.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Honour</HI> being again charged with a Commi&s;|&s;ion of Enquiry, had no &s;ooner applied her&s;elf to the Landlady, and had de&s;cribed the Per&s;on of Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> than that &s;agacious Woman began, in the vul|gar Phra&s;e, to &s;mell a Rat. When <HI>Sophia</HI> therefore entered the Room, in&s;tead of an&s;wering the Maid, the Landlady addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to the Mi&s;tre&s;s, began the following Speech. <Q REND="inline">'Good-lack-a-day! why there now, who would have thought it! I prote&s;t the lovelie&s;t Couple that ever Eyes beheld. I|fackins, Madam, it is no Wonder the Squire run on &s;o about your Lady&s;hip.

<PB N="276" REF="285">
<Q REND="inline">No &s;aucy Fellow,' an&s;wered the Landlady, 'but the young Gentleman you enquire after, and a very pretty young Gentleman he is, and he loves Madam <HI>Sophia We&s;tern</HI> to the Bottom of his Soul.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'He love my Lady!

<P><HI>Sophia</HI> did not &s;ee his Behaviour in &s;o very di&s;ad|vantageous a Light, and was perhaps more plea&s;ed with the violent Raptures of his Love (which the Landlady exaggrated as much as &s;he had done every other Circum&s;tance) than &s;he was offended with the re&s;t; and indeed &s;he imputed the whole to the Extrava|gance, or rather Ebullience of his Pa&s;&s;ion, and to the Openne&s;s of his Heart.</P>
<P>This Incident, however, being afterward revived in her Mind, and placed in the mo&s;t odious Colours by <HI>Honour,</HI> &s;erved to heighten and give Credit to tho&s;e unlucky Occurrences at <HI>Upton,</HI> and a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Wait|ing-woman in her Endeavours to make her Mi&s;tre&s;s depart from that Inn without &s;eeing <HI>Jones.</HI></P>
<P>The Landlady finding <HI>Sophia</HI> intended to &s;tay no longer than till her Hor&s;es were ready, and that with|out either eating or drinking, &s;oon withdrew; when <HI>Ho|nour</HI> began to take her Mi&s;tre&s;s to Ta&s;k (for indeed &s;he u&s;ed great Freedom) and after a long Harangue, in which &s;he reminded her of her Intention to go to
<PB N="277" REF="286">
<HI>London,</HI> and gave frequent Hints of the Impropriety of pur&s;uing a young Fellow, &s;he at la&s;t concluded with this &s;erious Exhortation: <Q REND="inline">'For Heaven's Sake, Madam, con&s;ider what you are about, and whither you are a going.'</Q></P>
<P>This Advice to a Lady who had already rode near forty Miles, and in no very agreeable Sea&s;on, may &s;eem fooli&s;h enough. It may be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he had well con&s;idered and re&s;olved this already; nay, Mrs. <HI>Honour,</HI> by the Hints &s;he threw out, &s;eemed to think &s;o; and this I doubt not is the Opinion of many Rea|ders, who have, I make no Doubt, been long &s;ince well convinced of the Purpo&s;e of our Heroine, and have heartily condemned her for it as a wanton Baggage.</P>
<P>But in reality this was not the Ca&s;e. <HI>Sophia</HI> had been lately &s;o di&s;tracted between Hope and Fear, her Duty and Love to her Father her Hatred to <HI>Blifil,</HI> her Compa&s;&s;ion, and (why &s;hould we not confe&s;s the Truth) her Love for <HI>Jones;</HI> which la&s;t the Behaviour of her Father, of her Aunt, of every one el&s;e, and more particularly of <HI>Jones</HI> him&s;elf, had blown into a Flame, that her Mind was in that confu&s;ed State, which may be truly &s;aid to make us ignorant of what we do, or whither we go, or rather indeed indifferent as to the Con&s;equence of either.</P>
<P>The prudent and &s;age Advice of her Maid, pro|duced, however, &s;ome cool Reflection; and &s;he at length determined to go to <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> and thence to proceed directly to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>But unluckily, a few Miles before &s;he entered that Town, &s;he met the Hack-Attorney, who, as is be|forementioned, had dined there with Mr. <HI>Jones.</HI> This Fellow being well known to Mrs. <HI>Honour,</HI> &s;topt and &s;poke to her; of which <HI>Sophia</HI> at that Time took little Notice, more than to enquire who he was.</P>
<P>But having had a more particular Account from <HI>Honour</HI> of this Man afterwards at <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> and hear|ing of the great Expedition he u&s;ually made in travelling,
<PB N="278" REF="287">

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">BOOK XI. <HI>Containing about three Days.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>a Cru&s;t for the Critics.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN our la&s;t initial Chapter, we may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have treated that formidable Set of Men, who are called Critics, with more Freedom than be|comes us; &s;ince they exact, and indeed gene|rally receive, great Conde&s;cention from Authors. We &s;hall in this, therefore, give the Rea&s;ons of our Conduct to this augu&s;t Body; and here we &s;hall per|haps place them in a Light, in which they have not hitherto been &s;een.</P>
<P>This Word Critic is of <HI>Greek</HI> Derivation, and &s;ignifies Judgment. Hence I pre&s;ume &s;ome Per&s;ons who have not under&s;tood the Original, and have &s;een the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tran&s;lation of the Primative, have con|cluded that it meant Judgment in the legal Sen&s;e,
<PB N="280" REF="289">
in which it is frequently u&s;ed as equivalent to Con|demnation.</P>
<P>I am the rather inclined to be of that Opinion as the greate&s;t Number of Critics hath of late Year been found among&s;t the Lawyers. Many of the&s;e Gentlemen, from De&s;pair, perhaps, of ever ri&s;ing to the Bench in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall,</HI> have placed them &s;elves on the Benches at the Playhou&s;es, where they have exerted their judicial Capacity, and have given Judgment, <HI>i. e.</HI> condemned without Mercy.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen would perhaps be well enough plea&s;ed, if we were to leave them thus compared to one of the mo&s;t important and honourable Offices in the Commonwealth, and if we intended to apply to their Favour we would do &s;o; but as we de&s;ign to deal very &s;incerely and plainly too with them, we mu&s;t remind them of another Officer of Ju&s;tice of a much lower Rank; to whom, as they not only pronounce but execute their own Judgment, they bear likewi&s;e &s;ome remote Re&s;emblance.</P>
<P>But in reality there is another Light in which the&s;e modern Critics may with great Ju&s;tice and Propriety be &s;een; and this is that of a common Slanderer. If a Per&s;on who prys into the Characters of others, with no other De&s;ign but to di&s;cover their Faults, and to publi&s;h them to the World, de&s;erves the Title of a Slanderer of the Reputations of Men; why &s;hould not a Critic, who reads with the &s;ame male-volent View, be as properly &s;tiled the Slanderer of the Reputation of Books?</P>
<P>Vice hath not, I believe, a more abject Slave; So|ciety produces not a more odious Vermin; nor can the Devil receive a Gue&s;t more worthy of him, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> po&s;&s;ibly more welcome to him, than a Slanderer. The World, I am afraid, regards not this Mon&s;ter with half the Abhorrence which he de&s;erves, and I am more afraid to a&s;&s;ign the Rea&s;on of this criminal Le|nity &s;hewn towards him; yet it is certain that the

Thief looks innocent in the Compari&s;on; nay, the Murderer him&s;elf can &s;eldom &s;tand in Competition with his Guilt: For Slander is a more cruel Weapon than a Sword, as the Wounds which the former gives are always incurable. One Method, indeed, there is of killing, and that the ba&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t execrable of all, which bears an exact Analogy to the Vice here di&s;claimed again&s;t, and that is Poi&s;on.

<P>With all this my good Reader will doubtle&s;s agree; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t much of it will probably &s;eem too &s;evere, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">pplied to the Slander of Books.

<P>Nor is there any paternal Fondne&s;s which &s;eems le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> to &s;avour of ab&s;olute In&s;tinct, which may &s;o well b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> reconciled to worldly Wi&s;dom as this.

<P>La&s;tly, The Slander of a Book is, in Truth, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Slander of the Author: For as no one can call and ther Ba&s;tard, without calling the Mother a Whore, neither can any one give the Names of &s;ad Stuff horrid Non&s;ence, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to a Book, without calling the Author a Blockhead; which tho' in a moral Sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> it is a preferable Appellation to that of Villain, perhaps rather more injurious to his worldly Intere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">&punc;</P>
<P>Now however ludicrous all this may appear &s;ome, others, I doubt not, will feel and acknowledg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Truth of it; nay, may, perhaps, think I have not treated the Subject with decent Solemnity; b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;urely a Man may &s;peak Truth with a &s;miling Cour|tenance.

Office; and a moro&s;e &s;narling Critic, may, I believe, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;u&s;pected to be a bad Man.</P>
<P>I will therefore endeavour in the remaining Part of this Chapter, to explain the Marks of this Cha|racter, and to &s;hew what Critici&s;m I here intend to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">obviate: For I can never be under&s;tood, unle&s;s by the very Per&s;ons here meant, to in&s;inuate, that there are no proper Judges of Writing, or to endeavour to exclude from the Commonwealth of Literature any of tho&s;e noble Critics, to who&s;e Labours the learned World are &s;o greatly indebted. Such were <HI>Ari&s;totle, Horace,</HI> and <HI>Longinus</HI> among the Ancients, <HI>Dacier</HI> and <HI>Bo&s;&s;u</HI> among the <HI>French,</HI> and &s;ome perhaps a|mong us; who have certainly been duly authorized to execute at lea&s;t a judicial Authority in <HI>Foro Literario.</HI></P>
<P>But without a&s;certaining all the proper Qualifica|tions of a Critic, which I have touched on el&s;ewhere, I think I may very boldly object to the Cen&s;ures of any one pa&s;t upon Works which he hath not him|&s;elf read. Such Cen&s;urers as the&s;e, whether they &s;peak from their own Gue&s;s or Su&s;picion, or from the Report and Opinion of others, may properly be &s;aid to &s;lander the Reputation of the Book they condemn.</P>
<P>Such may likewi&s;e be &s;u&s;pected of de&s;erving this Character, who without a&s;&s;igning any particular Faults, condemn the whole in general deformatory Terms; &s;uch as vile, dull, da&mdash;d Stuff, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and particularly by the U&s;e of the Mono&s;yllable LOW; a Word which becomes the Mouth of no Critic who is not RIGHT HONOURABLE.</P>
<P>Again, tho' there may be &s;ome Faults ju&s;tly a&s;&s;ign|ed in the Work, yet if tho&s;e are not in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Parts, or if they are compen&s;ated by greater Beauties, it will &s;avour rather of the Malice of a Slan|lerer, than of the Judgment of a true Critic, to pa&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;evere Sentence upon the whole, merely on account of &s;ome vicious Part.

<P>This Landlord had the Character, among all his Neighbours, of being a very &s;agacious Fellow.

His Behaviour likewi&s;e, greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted in promoting the Opinion of his Wi&s;|dom. In his Deportment he was &s;olemn, if not &s;ullen; and when he &s;poke, which was &s;eldom, he always delivered him&s;elf in a &s;low Voice; and though his Sentences were &s;hort, they were &s;till interrupted with many Hum's and Ha's, Ay, Ays, and other Expletives: So that though he accompanied his Words with certain explanatory Ge&s;tures, &s;uch as &s;haking, or nodding the Head, or pointing with his Forefinger he generally left his Hearers to under&s;tand more than he expre&s;&s;ed; nay, he commonly gave them a Hint that he knew much more than he thought proper to di&s;clo&s;e. This la&s;t Circum&s;tance alone, may, indeed very well account for his Character of Wi&s;dom, &s;ince Men are &s;trangely inclined to wor&s;hip what they do not under&s;tand.

<P>MRS. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> after a Silence of a few Mo|ments, fetching a deep Sigh, thus began:</P>

which have been mo&s;t delightful to them. The Re|membrance of pa&s;t Plea&s;ures affects us with a kind of tender Grief, like what we &s;uffer for departed Friends; and the Ideas of both may be &s;aid to haunt our Imaginations.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'For this Rea&s;on, I never reflect without Sorrow on tho&s;e Days (the happie&s;t far of my Life) which we &s;pent together, when both were under the Care of my Aunt <HI>We&s;tern.</HI> Alas? why are Mi&s;s <HI>Grave|airs,</HI> and Mi&s;s <HI>Giddy</HI> no more. You remember, I am &s;ure, when we knew each other by no other Names. Indeed you gave me the latter Appella|tion with too ju&s;t Cau&s;e. I have &s;ince experienced how much I de&s;erved it. You, my <HI>Sophia,</HI> was always my Superior in every thing, and I heartily hope you will be &s;o in your Fortune. I &s;hall never for|get the wi&s;e and matronly Advice you once gave me when I lamented being di&s;appointed of a Ball, though you could not be then fourteen Years old.&mdash;O my <HI>Sophy,</HI> how ble&s;t mu&s;t have been my Situation, when I could think &s;uch a Di&s;appointment a Misfortune and when indeed it was the greate&s;t I had ever known.'</Q></P>

repre&s;ented, I will &s;et out from the very Com|mencement of my unfortunate Acquaintance with my Hu&s;band; which was at <HI>Bath,</HI> &s;oon after you' left my Aunt, and returned home to your Father.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Among the gay young Fellows, who were at this Sea&s;on at <HI>Bath,</HI> Mr. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> was one. He was hand&s;ome, degag&eacute;, extremely gallant, and in his Dre&s;s exceeded mo&s;t others. In &s;hort, my Dear, if you was unluckily to &s;ee him now, I could de&s;cribe him no better than by telling you he was the very Rever&s;e of every Thing which he is: For he hath ru&s;ticated him&s;elf &s;o long, that he is become an ab&s;olute wild <HI>Iri&s;hman.</HI> But to pro|ceed in my Story; the Qualifications which he then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;o well recommended him, that though the People of Quality at this Time lived &s;eparate from the re&s;t of the Company, and excluded them from all their Parties, Mr. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> found Means to gain Admittance. It was perhaps no ea&s;y Matter to avoid him; for he required very little or no In|vitation; and as being hand&s;ome and genteel, he found it no difficult Matter to ingratiate him&s;elf with the Ladies, &s;o, he having frequently drawn his Sword, the Men did not care publickly to affront him. Had it not been for &s;ome &s;uch Rea&s;on, I believe he would have been &s;oon expelled by his own Sex; for &s;urely he had no &s;trict Title to be prefer|red to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentry; nor did they &s;eem inclin|ed to &s;hew him any extraordinary Favour. They all abu&s;ed him behind his Back, which might proba|bly proceed from Envy; for he was well received,' and very particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Women.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'My Aunt, tho' no Per&s;on of Quality her&s;elf, as &s;he had always lived about the Court, was enrolled in that Party: For by whatever Means you get into the Polite Circle, when you are once there, it is &s;ufficient Merit for you that you are there. This Ob&s;ervation, young as you was, you could &s;carce

avoid making from my Aunt, who was free, or re|&s;erved, with all People, ju&s;t as they had more o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">' le&s;s of this Merit.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'And this Merit, I believe, it was, which prin|cipally recommended Mr. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> to her Fa|vour. In which he &s;o well &s;ucceeded, that he was always one of her private Parties. Nor was h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> backward in returning &s;uch Di&s;tinction; for he &s;oon grew &s;o very particular in his Behaviour to her, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Scandal Club fir&s;t began to take Notice of it and the better di&s;po&s;ed Per&s;ons made a Match be|tween them. For my own Part, I confe&s;s, I made no Doubt but that his De&s;igns were &s;trictly honour|able, as the Phra&s;e is; that is, to rob a Lady of he Fortune by Way of Marriage. My Aunt was, conceived, neither young enough nor hand&s;ome enough, to attract much wicked Inclination; but' &s;he had matrimonial Charms in great Abundance.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'I was the more confirmed in this Opinion from the extraordinary Re&s;pect which he &s;hewed to my &s;elf from the fir&s;t Moment of our Acquaintance. This I under&s;tood as an attempt to le&s;&s;en, if po&s;&s;ible that Di&s;inclination which my Intere&s;t might be &s;up|po&s;ed to give me towards the Match; and I know no but in &s;ome Mea&s;ure it had that Effect: for as I was well contented with my own Fortune, and of all People the lea&s;t a Slave to intere&s;ted Views, &s;o could not be violently the Enemy of a Man with who&s;e Behaviour to me I was greatly plea&s;ed; and the more &s;o, as I was the only Object of &s;uch Re|&s;pect; for he behaved at the &s;ame Time to many' Women of Quality without any Re&s;pect at all.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Agreeable as this was to me, he &s;oon changed i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> into another Kind of Behaviour, which was per|haps more &s;o.

ty and Mirth; but this was always in general Com|pany, and with other Women; for even in a Coun|try Dance, when he was not my Partner, he became grave and put on the &s;ofte&s;t Look imaginable, the Moment he approached me. Indeed he was in all Things &s;o very particular towards me, that I mu&s;t have been blind not to have di&s;covered it. And, and, and</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'And you was more plea&s;ed &s;till, my dear <HI>Harriet,'</HI> cries <HI>Sophia;</HI> 'you need not be a&s;hamed, added &s;he &s;ighing, 'for &s;ure there are ir|re&s;i&s;tible Charms in Tenderne&s;s, which too many Men are able to affect.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'True,' an&s;wered her Cou|&s;in, 'Men who in all other In&s;tances want common 'Sen&s;e, are very <HI>Machiavels</HI> in the Art of Loving.

<P><Q REND="inline">'But what may &s;eem a&s;toni&s;hing; my Aunt never &s;aw, nor in the lea&s;t &s;eemed to &s;u&s;pect that which was vi&s;ible enough, I believe, from both our Be|haviours. One would indeed think, that Love quite puts out the Eyes of an old Woman. In Fact, they &s;o greedily &s;wallow the Addre&s;&s;es which are made to them, that like an outragious Glutton, they are not at Lei&s;ure to ob&s;erve what pa&s;&s;es among&s;t others at the &s;ame Table. This I have ob&s;erved in more Ca&s;es than my own; and this was &s;o &s;trong|ly verified by my Aunt, that tho' &s;he often found us together at her Return from the Pump, the lea&s;t: canting Word of his, pretending Impatience at her Ab&s;ence effectually &s;mothered all Su&s;picion. One Artifice &s;ucceeded with her to Admiration. This was his treating me like a little Child, and never calling me by any other Name in her Pre&s;ence, but that of pretty Mi&s;s. This indeed did him &s;ome Di&s;&s;er|vice with your humble Servant; but I &s;oon &s;aw
<PB N="300" REF="309">
through it, e&s;pecially as in her Ab&s;ence he behaved to me, as I have &s;aid, in a different Manner. How|ever, if I was not greatly di&s;obliged by a Conduct of which I had di&s;covered the De&s;ign, I &s;marted ve|ry &s;everely for it: For my Aunt really conceived me to be what her Lover (as &s;he thought him) call|ed me, and treated me, in all Re&s;pects, as a perfect Infant. To &s;ay the Truth, I wonder &s;he had not in|&s;i&s;ted on my again wearing Leading-&s;trings.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'At la&s;t, my Lover (for &s;o he was) thought pro|per, in a mo&s;t &s;olemn Manner, to di&s;clo&s;e a Secret which I had known long before. He now placed all the Love which he had pretended to my Aunt to my Account. He lamented the Encouragement &s;he had given him in very pathetic Terms, and made a high Merit of the tedious Hours, in which he had undergone her Conver&s;ation.&mdash;What &s;hall I tell you, my dear <HI>Sophia?&mdash;</HI>Then I will con|fe&s;s the Truth. I was plea&s;ed with my Man. I was plea&s;ed with my Conque&s;t. To rival my Aunt delighted me; to rival &s;o many other Women charmed me. In &s;hort, I am afraid, I did not behave as I &s;hould do, even upon the very fir&s;t De|claration.&mdash;I wi&s;h I did not almo&s;t give him po&s;i|tive Encouragement before we parted.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'The <HI>Bath</HI> now talked loudly, I might almo&s;t &s;ay, roared again&s;t me. Several young Women affected to &s;hun my Acquaintance, not &s;o much, perhaps, from any real Su&s;picion, as from a De&s;ire of bani&s;hing me from a Company, in which I too much engro&s;&s;ed their favourite Man. And here I cannot omit expre&s;&s;ing my Gratitude to the Kindne&s;s intended me by Mr. <HI>Na&s;h;</HI> who took me one Day a&s;ide, and gave me Advice, which if I had follow|ed, I had been a happy Woman.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Child," &s;ays he, 'I am &s;orry to &s;ee the Familiarity which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between you and a Fellow who is altogether un|worthy of you, and I am afraid will prove your

As for your old &s;tinking Aunt, if it was to be no Injury to you, and my pretty <HI>Sophia We&s;tern</HI> (I a&s;&s;ure you I repeat his Words) I &s;hould be hear|tily glad, that the Fellow was in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all that belongs to her.

'&mdash;Many more Things he &s;aid to me, which I have now forgotton, and indeed I attended very little to them at that Time: For Inclination contradicted all he &s;aid, and be&s;ides I could not be per&s;uaded, that Women of Quality would conde&s;cend to Familiarity with &s;uch a Per&s;on as he de&s;cribed.'</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">'The very next Day, my Aunt left the Place, partly to avoid &s;eeing Mr. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> or my &s;elf, and as much perhaps to avoid &s;eeing any one el&s;e; for, tho' I am told &s;he hath &s;ince denied every thing &s;toutly, I believe &s;he was then a little confounded at her Di&s;appointment.

What added to my Wretch|edne&s;s, was the Lo&s;s of my little Infant: Not that I pretend to have had for it that extravagant Tenderne&s;s of which I believe I might have been capable under other Circum&s;tances; but I re&s;olved, in every In&s;tance, to di&s;charge the Duty of the ten|dere&s;t Mother, and this Care prevented me from feeling the Weight of that, heavie&s;t of all Things, when it can be at all &s;aid to lie heavy on our Hands.'</Q></P>

The Truth is, the Pa&s;&s;ion of Love is too re&s;tle&s;s to remain con|conted, without the Gratification which it receives from its Object; and one can no more be inclined to love without loving, than we can have Eyes without &s;eeing.

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. <HI>A dreadful Alarm in the Inn, with the Arrival of an unexpected Friend of Mrs.</HI> Fitzpatrick.</HEAD>
<P><HI>SOPHIA</HI> now at the De&s;ire of her Cou&s;in, related&mdash;not what follows, but what hath gone be|fore in this Hi&s;tory: For which rea&s;on the Reader will, I &s;uppo&s;e, excu&s;e me, for not repeating it over again.</P>
<P>One Remark, however, I cannot forbear making on her Narrative, namely, that &s;he made no more mention of <HI>Jones,</HI> from the Beginning to the End, than if there had been no &s;uch Per&s;on alive.

<P>Ju&s;t as <HI>Sophia</HI> arrived at the Conclu&s;ion of her Sto|ry, there arrived in the Room where the two Ladies were &s;itting, a Noi&s;e, not unlike, in Loudne&s;s, to that of a Pack of Hounds ju&s;t let out from their Ken|nel; nor, in Shrillne&s;s, to Cats when caterwauling; or to Screech-Owls; or, indeed, more like (for what Animal can re&s;emble a human Voice) to tho&s;e Sounds, which, in the plea&s;ant Man&s;ions of that Gate, which &s;eems to derive its Name from a Dupli|city of Tongues, i&s;&s;ue from the Mouths, and &s;ome|times

<P><PB N="325" REF="334">
On this Subject, Reader, I mu&s;t &s;top a Moment to tell thee a Story. <Q REND="inline">'The famous <HI>Nell Gwynn,</HI> &s;tepping one Day from a Hou&s;e where &s;he had made a &s;hort Vi&s;it in her Coach, &s;aw a great Mob a&s;&s;em|bled, and her Footman all bloody and dirty; the Fellow being a&s;ked, by his Mi&s;tre&s;s, the Rea&s;on of his being in that Condition, an&s;wered, 'I have been fighting, Madam, with an impudent Re&s;cal who called your Lady&s;hip a Wh&mdash;re. 'You Block|head,' replied Mrs. <HI>Gwynn,</HI> 'at this Rate you mu&s;t fight every Day of your Life; why, you Fool, all the World knows it.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Do they?" cries the Fellow, in a muttering Voice, after he had &s;hut the Coach Door, 'they &s;han't call me a Whore's Foot|man for all that.'</Q></P>
<P>Thus the Pa&s;&s;ion of Mrs. <HI>Honour</HI> appears natural enough, even if it were to be no otherwi&s;e accounted for; but in reality, there was another Cau&s;e of her Anger; for which we mu&s;t beg Leave to remind our Reader of a Circum&s;tance mentioned in the above Si|mile. There are indeed certain Liquors, which be|ing applied to our Pa&s;&s;ions, or to Fire, produce Ef|fects the very Rever&s;e of tho&s;e produced by Water, as they &s;erve to kindle and inflame, rather than to ex|tingui&s;h. Among the&s;e, the generous Liquor called Punch is one. It was not therefore without Rea&s;on, that the learned Dr. <HI>Cheney</HI> u&s;ed to call drinking Punch pouring liquid Fire down your Throat.</P>
<P>Now Mrs. <HI>Honour</HI> had unluckily poured &s;o much of this liquid Fire down her Throat, that the Smoke of it began to a&s;cend into her Pericranium, and blinded the Eyes of Rea&s;on which is there &s;uppo&s;ed to keep her Re&s;idence, while the Fire it&s;elf from the Stomach ea&s;ily reached the Heart, and there inflamed the no|ble Pa&s;&s;ion of Pride. So that upon the whole, we &s;hall cea&s;e to wonder at the violent Rage of the Wait|ing-woman; tho' at fir&s;t Sight we mu&s;t confe&s;s the Cau&s;e &s;eems inadequate to the Effect.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="335">
<HI>Sophia</HI> and her Cou&s;in both, did all in their Power to extingui&s;h the&s;e Flames which had roared &s;o loudly all over the Hou&s;e. They at length prevailed; or, to carry the Metaphor one Step farther, the Fire hav|ing con&s;umed all the Fuel which the Language affords, to wit, every reproachful Term in it, at la&s;t went out of its own Accord.</P>
<P>But tho' Tranquillity was re&s;tored above Stairs, it was not &s;o below; where my Landlady highly re&s;ent|ing the Injury done to the Beauty of her Hu&s;band, by the Fle&s;h-Spades of Mrs. <HI>Honour,</HI> called aloud for Re|venge and Ju&s;tice. As to the poor Man who had principally &s;uffered in the Engagement, he was perfect|ly quiet. Perhaps the Blood which he lo&s;t might have cooled his Anger: For the Enemy had not only applied her Nails to his Cheeks, but likewi&s;e her Fi&s;t to his No&s;tils, which lamented the Blow with Tears of Blood in great Abundance. To this we may add Reflections on his Mi&s;take; but indeed nothing &s;o ef|fectually &s;ilenced his Re&s;entment, as the Manner in which he now di&s;covered his Error; for as to the Be|haviour of Mrs. <HI>Honour,</HI> it had the more confirmed him in his Opinion: but he was now a&s;&s;ured by a Per|&s;on of great Figure, and who was attended by a great Equipage, that one of the Ladies was a Woman of Fa&s;hion, and his intimate Acquaintance.</P>
<P>By the Orders of this Per&s;on, the Landlord now a&s;cended, and acquainted our fair Travellers, that a great Gentleman below de&s;ired to do them the Honour of waiting on them. <HI>Sophia</HI> turned pale, and trem|bled at this Me&s;&s;age, tho' the Reader will conclude it was too civil, notwith&s;tanding the Landlord's Blun|der, to have come from her Father; but Fear hath the common Fault of a Ju&s;tice of Peace, and is apt to con|clude ha&s;tily from every &s;light Circum&s;tance, without examining the Evidence on both Sides.</P>
<P>To ea&s;e the Reader's Curio&s;ity, therefore, rather than his Apprehen&s;ions, we proceed to inform him,
<PB N="327" REF="336">
that an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Peer had arrived very late that Evening at the Inn in his Way to <HI>London.</HI> This Nobleman hav|ing &s;allied from his Supper at the Hurricane before commemorated, had &s;een the Attendant of Mrs. <HI>Fitz|patrick,</HI> and upon a &s;hort Enquiry was informed, that her Lady, with whom he was very particularly ac|quainted was above. This Information he had no &s;ooner received, than he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the Land|lord, pacified him, and &s;ent him up Stairs with Com|pliments rather civiler than tho&s;e which were deli|vered.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be wondered at, that the Waiting-woman her&s;elf was not the Me&s;&s;enger employed on this Occa&s;ion; but we are &s;orry to &s;ay, &s;he was not at pre&s;ent qualified for that, or indeed for any other Office. The Rum (for &s;o the Landlord cho&s;e to call the Di&s;|tillation from Malt) had ba&s;ely taken the Advantage of the Fatigue which the poor Woman had undergone, and had made terrible Depredations on her noble Fa|culties, at a Time when they were very unable to re|&s;i&s;t the Attack.</P>
<P>We &s;hall not de&s;cribe this tragical Scene too fully; but we thought our&s;elves obliged by that hi&s;toric In|tegrity which we profe&s;s, &s;hortly to hint a Matter which we would otherwi&s;e have been glad to have &s;pared. Many Hi&s;torians indeed, for Want of this In|tegrity, or of Diligence, to &s;ay no wor&s;e, often leave the Reader to find out the&s;e little Circum&s;tances in the Dark, and &s;ometimes to his great Confu&s;ion and Per|plexity.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> was very &s;oon ea&s;ed of her cau&s;ele&s;s Fright by the Entry of the noble Peer, who was not only an intimate Acquaintance of Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick;</HI> but in reality a very particular Friend of that Lady. To &s;ay Truth, it was by his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, that &s;he had been enabled to e&s;cape from her Husband; for this Noble|man had the &s;ame gallant Di&s;po&s;ition with tho&s;e re|nowned Knights, of whom we read in heroic Story,
<PB N="328" REF="337">
and had delivered many an impri&s;oned Nymph from Durance. He was indeed as bitter an Enemy to the &s;avage Authority too often exerci&s;ed by Hu&s;bands and Fathers, over the young and lovely of the other Sex, as ever Knight Errant was to the barbarous Power of Enchanters: nay, to &s;ay Truth, I have often &s;u&s;pected that tho&s;e very Enchanters with which Romance every where abounds, were in reality no other than the Hu&s;bands of tho&s;e Days: and Matri|mony it&s;elf was perhaps the enchanted Ca&s;tle in which the Nymphs were &s;aid to be confined.</P>
<P>This Nobleman had an E&s;tate in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> and had been for &s;ome Time acquainted with the Lady. No &s;ooner therefore did he hear of her Confinement, than he earne&s;tly applied him&s;elf to procure her Liberty; which he pre&s;ently effected, not by &s;torming the Ca&s;tle, according to the Example of ancient Heroes; but by corrupting the Governor, in Conformity with the modern Art of War; in which Craft is held to be preferable to Valour, and Gold is found to be more irre&s;i&s;tible than either Lead or Steel.</P>
<P>This Circum&s;tance, however, as the Lady did not think it material enough to relate to her Friend, we would not at that Time impart it to the Reader. We rather cho&s;e to leave him a while under a Suppo&s;ition, that &s;he had found, or coined, or by &s;ome very ex|traordinary, perhaps &s;upernatural Means, had po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed her&s;elf of the Money with which &s;he had bribed her Keeper, than to interrupt her Narrative by giv|ing a Hint of what &s;eemed to her of too little Impor|tance to be mentioned.</P>
<P>The Peer after a &s;hort Conver&s;ation, could not forbear expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome Surprize at meeting the La|dy in that Place, nor could he refrain from telling her, he imagined &s;he had been gone to <HI>Bath.</HI> Mrs. <HI>Fitz|patrick</HI> very freely an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">'That &s;he had been prevented in her Purpo&s;e by the Arrival of a Per&s;on
<PB N="329" REF="338">
&s;he need not mention. In &s;hort,' &s;ays &s;he, 'I was overtaken by my Hu&s;band (for I need not af|fect to conceal what the World knows too well al|ready.) I had the good Fortune to e&s;cape in a mo&s;t &s;urprizing Manner, and am now going to <HI>London</HI> with this young Lady, who is a near Relation of mine, and who hath e&s;caped from as great a Ty|rant as my own.'</Q></P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip concluding that this Tyrant was like|wi&s;e a Hu&s;band, made a Speech, full of Compliments to both the Ladies, and as full of Invectives again&s;t his own Sex; nor indeed did he avoid &s;ome oblique Glances at the matrimonial In&s;titution it&s;elf, and at the unju&s;t Powers given by it to Man over the more &s;en&s;ible, and more meritorious Part of the Species. He ended his Oration with an Offer of his Protecti|on, and of his Coach and Six, which was in&s;tantly accepted by Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> and at la&s;t, upon her Per&s;ua&s;ions, by <HI>Sophia.</HI></P>
<P>Matters being thus adju&s;ted, his Lord&s;hip took his Leave, and the Ladies retired to Re&s;t, where Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> entertained her Cou&s;in with many high Encomiums on the Character of the noble Peer, and enlarged very particularly on his great Fondne&s;s for his Wife; &s;aying, &s;he believed he was almo&s;t the only Per&s;on of his Rank, who was entirely con&s;tant to the Marriage Bed. <Q REND="inline">'Indeed, added &s;he, my dear <HI>Sophy,</HI> that is a very rare Virtue among&s;t Men of Condi|tion. Never expect it when you marry; for, be|lieve me, if you do, you will certainly be deceiv|ed.'</Q></P>
<P>A gentle Sigh &s;tole from <HI>Sophia</HI> at the&s;e Words, which perhaps contributed to form a Dream of no very plea&s;ant Kind; but as &s;he never revealed this Dream to any one, &s;o the Reader cannot expect to &s;ee it re|lated here.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. <HI>The Morning introduced in &s;ome pretty Writing. A Stage Coach. The Civility of Chambermaids. The heroic Temper of</HI> Sophia. <HI>Her Genero&s;ity. The Return to it. The Departure of the Company, and their Arrival at</HI> London; <HI>with &s;ome Remarks for the U&s;e of Travellers.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THOSE Members of the Society, who are born to furni&s;h the Ble&s;&s;ings of Life, now began to light their Candles, in order to pur&s;ue their daily La|bours, for the U&s;e of tho&s;e who are born to enjoy the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings. The &s;turdy Hind now attends the Levee of his Fellow Labourer the OX; the cunning Artificer, the diligent mechanic &s;pring from their hard Mattre&s;s; and now the bonny Hou&s;e-maid begins to repair the di&s;ordered Drum-Room, while the riotous Authors of that Di&s;order, in broken interrupted Slum|bers, tumble and to&s;s, as if the Hardne&s;s of Down di&s;quieted their Repo&s;e.</P>
<P>In &s;imple Phra&s;e, the Clock had no &s;ooner &s;truck Seven, than the Ladies were ready for their Journey, and at their De&s;ire, his Lord&s;hip and his Equipage were prepared to attend them.</P>
<P>And now a Matter of &s;ome Difficulty aro&s;e; and this was how his Lord&s;hip him&s;elf &s;hould be convey|ed: For tho' in Stage Coaches, where Pa&s;&s;engers are properly con&s;idered as &s;o much Luggage, the inge|nious Coachman &s;tows half a Dozen with perfect Ea&s;e into the Place of four: for well he contrives that the fat Ho&s;te&s;s, or well-fed Alderman, may take up no more Room than the &s;lim Mi&s;s, or taper Ma&s;|ter; it being the Nature of Guts, when well &s;queez|ed, to give Way, and to lie in a narrow Compa&s;s; yet in the&s;e Vehicles which are called, for Di&s;tinction|&s;ake, Gentlemens Coaches, tho' they are often larger
<PB N="331" REF="340">
than the others, this Method of packing is never at|tempted.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip would have put a &s;hort End to the Difficulty, by very gallantly de&s;iring to mount his Hor&s;e; but Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> would by no Means con&s;ent to it. It was therefore concluded that the <HI>Abigails</HI> &s;hould by Turns relieve each other on one of his Lord&s;hip's Hor&s;es, which was pre&s;ently equip|ped with a Side-Saddle for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Every thing being &s;ettled at the Inn, the Ladies di&s;charged their former Guides, and <HI>Sophia</HI> made a pre&s;ent to the Landlord, partly to repair the Brui&s;e which he had received under her&s;elf, and partly on Account of what he had &s;uffered under the Hands of her enraged Waiting-woman. And now <HI>Sophia</HI> fir&s;t di&s;covered a Lo&s;s which gave her &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s; and this was of the hundred Pound Bank Bill which her Father had given her at their la&s;t Meeting; and which, within a very incon&s;iderable Trifle, was all the Trea&s;ure &s;he was at pre&s;ent worth. She &s;earched e|very where, and &s;hook and tumbled all her Things to no Purpo&s;e, the Bill was not to be found: And &s;he was at la&s;t fully per&s;uaded that &s;he had lo&s;t it from her Pocket when &s;he had the Misfortune of tumbling from her Hor&s;e in the dark Lane, as before recorded. A Fact that &s;eemed the more probable, as &s;he now recollected &s;ome Di&s;compo&s;ure in her Pockets which had happened at that Time, and the great Difficulty with which &s;he had drawn forth her Handkerchief the very In&s;tant before her Fall, in order to relieve the Di&s;tre&s;s of Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick.</HI></P>
<P>Misfortunes of this Kind, whatever Inconvenien|cies they may be attended with, are incapable of &s;ub|duing a Mind in which there is any Strength, with|out the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Avarice. <HI>Sophia</HI> therefore, tho' nothing could be wor&s;e timed than this Accident, at &s;uch a Sea&s;on, immediately got the better of her Con|cern, and with her wonted Serenity and Cheerfulne&s;s
<PB N="332" REF="341">
of Countenance, returned to her Company. His Lord&s;hip conducted the Ladies into the Vehicle, as he did likewi&s;e Mrs. <HI>Honour,</HI> who, after many Ci|vilities, and more Dear Madams, at la&s;t yielded to the well-bred Importunities of her Si&s;ter <HI>Abigail,</HI> and &s;ubmitted to be complimented with the fir&s;t Ride in the Coach; in which indeed &s;he would afterwards have been contented to have pur&s;ued her whole Jour|ney, had not her Mi&s;tre&s;s, after &s;everal fruitle&s;s In|timations, at length forced her to take her Turn on Hor&s;eback.</P>
<P>The Coach now having received its Company, began to move forwards, attended by many Servants, and by two led Captains, who had before rode with his Lord&s;hip, and who would have been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the Vehicle upon a much le&s;s worthy Occa&s;ion, than was this of accommodating two Ladies. In this they acted only as Gentlemen; but they were rea|dy at any Time to have performed the Office of a Footman, or indeed would have conde&s;cended lower, for the Honour of his Lord&s;hip's Company, and for the Convenience of his Table.</P>
<P>My Landlord was &s;o plea&s;ed with the Pre&s;ent he had received from <HI>Sophia,</HI> that he rather rejoiced in than regretted his Brui&s;e, or his Scratches. The Reader will perhaps be curious to know the <HI>Quantum</HI> of this Pre&s;ent, but we cannot &s;atisfy his Curio&s;ity. Whatever it was, it &s;atisfied the Landlord for his bo|dily Hurt; but he lamented he had not known before how little the Lady valued her Money; <Q REND="inline">'For to be &s;ure,' &s;ays he, 'one might have charged every Ar|ticle double, and &s;he would have made no Cavil at the Reckoning.'</Q></P>
<P>His Wife however was far from drawing this Con|clu&s;ion; whether &s;he really felt any Injury done to her Hu&s;band more than he did him&s;elf, I will not &s;ay; certain it is, &s;he was much le&s;s &s;atisfied with the Ge|nero&s;ity of <HI>Sophia.</HI> Indeed,' cries &s;he, 'my Dear,
<PB N="333" REF="342">
the Lady knows better how to di&s;po&s;e of her Money than you imagine. She might very well think we &s;hould not put up &s;uch a Bu&s;ine&s;s without &s;ome Sa|tisfaction, and the Law would have co&s;t her an in|finite deal more than this poor little Matter, which I wonder you would take.' 'You are always &s;o bloodily wi&s;e,' quoth the Hu&s;band, 'It would have co&s;t her more, would it? Do&s;t fancy I don't know that as well as thee? But would any of that more, or &s;o much, have come into our Pockets? Indeed, if Son <HI>Tom</HI> the Lawyer had been alive, I could have been glad to have put &s;uch a pretty Bu&s;ine&s;s into his Hands. He would have got a good Picking out of it; but I have no Relation now who is a Lawyer, and why &s;hould I go to Law for the Be|nefit of Strangers? Nay, to be &s;ure,' an&s;wered &s;he, you mu&s;t know be&s;t.' 'I believe I do,' replied <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e. 'I fancy when Money is to be got, I can &s;mell it out as well as another. Every body, let me tell you, would not have talked People out of this. Mind that, I &s;ay, every body would not have ca|joled this out of her, mind that.' The Wife then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">oined in the Applau&s;e of her Hu&s;band's Sagacity; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nd thus ended the &s;hort Dialogue between them on his Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>We will therefore take our Leave of the&s;e good People; and attend his Lord&s;hip and his fair Com|panions, who made &s;uch good Expedition, that they performed a Journey of ninety Miles in two Days, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nd on the &s;econd Evening arrived in <HI>London,</HI> without having encountered any one Adventure on the Road worthy the Dignity of this Hi&s;tory to relate.

<HEAD>CHAP. X. <HI>Containing a Hint or two concerning Virtue, and a few more concerning Su&s;picion.</HI></HEAD>
<P>OUR Company being arrived at <HI>London,</HI> were &s;et down at his Lord&s;hip's Hou&s;e, where while they refre&s;hed them&s;elves after the Fatigue of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ourney, Servants were di&s;patched to provide a Lodg|ing for the two Ladies; for as her Lady&s;hip was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ot then in Town, Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> would by no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">leans con&s;ent to accept a Bed in the Man&s;ion of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">he Peer.</P>
<P>Some Readers will perhaps condemn this extra|ordinary Delicacy, as I may call it, of Virtue, as too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ice and &s;crupulous; but we mu&s;t make Allowances
<PB N="336" REF="345">
for her Situation, which mu&s;t be owned to have been very tickli&s;h: and when we con&s;ider the Malice of cen&s;orious Tongues, we mu&s;t allow, if it was a Fault, the Fault was an Exce&s;s on the right Side, and which every Woman who is in the &s;elf-&s;ame Situation will do well to imitate. The mo&s;t formal Appear|ance of Virtue, when it is only an Appearance, may perhaps, in very ab&s;tracted Con&s;iderations, &s;eem to be rather le&s;s commendable than Virtue it&s;elf without this Formality; but it will however be always more commended; and this, I believe, will be granted by all, that it is nece&s;&s;ary, unle&s;s in &s;ome very par|ticular Ca&s;es, for every Women to &s;upport either the one or the other.</P>
<P>A Lodging being prepared, <HI>Sophia</HI> accompanied her Cou&s;in for that Evening; but re&s;olved early in the Morning to enquire after the Lady, into who&s;e Protection, as we have formerly mentioned, &s;he had determined to throw her&s;elf, when &s;he quitted her Father's Hou&s;e. And this &s;he was the more ea|ger in doing, for &s;ome Ob&s;ervations &s;he had made during her Journey in the Coach.</P>
<P>Now as we could by no Means fix the odious Cha|racter of Su&s;picion on <HI>Sophia,</HI> we are almo&s;t afraid to open to our Reader the Conceits which filled he Mind concerning Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick;</HI> of whom &s;he certainly entertained at pre&s;ent &s;ome Doubts; which as they are very apt to enter into the Bo&s;oms of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> wor&s;t of People, we think proper not to mention more plainly, till we have fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted a Word o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> two to our Reader touching Su&s;picion in general.</P>
<P>Of this there have always appeared to me to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> two Degrees. The fir&s;t of the&s;e I chu&s;e to deriv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> from the Heart, as the extreme Velocity of its Di&s;|cernment &s;eems to denote &s;ome previous inward Impul&s;e, and the rather, as this &s;uperlative Degre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> often forms its own Objects; &s;ees what it is not
<PB N="337" REF="346">
and always more than really exi&s;ts. This is that quick-&s;ighted Penetration, who&s;e Hawk's Eyes no Symptom of Evil can e&s;cape; which ob&s;erves not only upon the Actions, but upon the Words and Looks of Men; and as it proceeds from the Heart of the Ob&s;erver, &s;o it dives into the Heart of the Ob|&s;erved, and there e&s;pies Evil, as it were, in the fir&s;t Embryo; nay &s;ometimes before it can be &s;aid to be conceived. An admirable Faculty, if it were infal|lible; but as this Degree of Perfection is not even claimed by more than one mortal Being, &s;o from the Fallibility of &s;uch acute Di&s;cernment have ari&s;en many &s;ad Mi&s;chiefs and mo&s;t grievous Heart-akes to Innocence and Virtue. I cannot help therefore re|garding this va&s;t Quick&s;ightedne&s;s into Evil, as a vici|ous Exce&s;s, and a very pernicious Evil in it&s;elf. And I am the more inclined to this Opinion, as I am afraid it always proceeds from a Bad Heart, for the Rea|&s;ons I have above-mentioned, and for one more, namely, becau&s;e I never knew it the Property of a good one. Now from this Degree of Su&s;picion I entirely and ab&s;olutely acquit <HI>Sophia.</HI></P>
<P>A &s;econd Degree of this Quality &s;eems to ari&s;e from the Head. This is indeed no other than the Faculty of &s;eeing what is before your Eyes, and of drawing Conclu&s;ions from what you &s;ee. The for|mer of the&s;e is unavoidable by tho&s;e who have any Eyes, and the latter is perhaps no le&s;s certain and nece&s;&s;ary a Con&s;equence of our having any Brains. This is altogether as bitter an Enemy to Guilt, as the former is to Innocence, nor can I &s;ee it in an un|amiable Light, even though, through human Fallibi|lity, it &s;hould be &s;ometimes mi&s;taken. For In&s;tance, if a Hu&s;band &s;hould accidentally &s;urprize his Wife in the Lap or in the Embraces of &s;ome of tho&s;e pretty young Gentlemen who profe&s;s the Art of Cuckol|dom, I &s;hould not highly, I think, blame him for

concluding more than what he &s;aw, from the Fami|liarities which he really had &s;een, and which we are at lea&s;t favourable enough to, when we call them in|nocent Freedoms. The Reader will ea&s;ily &s;ugge&s;t great Plenty of In&s;tances to him&s;elf; I &s;hall add but one more, which however unchri&s;tian it may be thought by &s;ome, I cannot help e&s;teeming to be &s;trict|ly ju&s;tifiable; and this is a Su&s;picion that a Man is|capable of doing what he hath done already, and tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> it is po&s;&s;ible for one who hath been a Villain once, to act the &s;ame Part again. And to confe&s;s the Truth, of this Degree of Su&s;picion, I believe, <HI>Sophia</HI> was guil|ty. From this Degree of Su&s;picion &s;he had, in Fact, conceived an Opinion, that her Cou&s;in was really not better than &s;he &s;hould be.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e it &s;eems, was this: Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> wi&s;ely con&s;idered, that the Virtue of a young Lady is, in the World, in the &s;ame Situation with a poor Hare, which is certain, whenever it ventures abroad, to meet its Enemies: For it can hardly meet any other. No &s;ooner therefore was &s;he determined to take the fir&s;t Opportunity of quitting the Protection of her Hu&s;band, than &s;he re&s;olved to ca&s;t her&s;elf un|der the Protection of &s;ome other Man; and whom could &s;he &s;o properly chu&s;e to be her Guardian as a Per&s;on of Quality, of Fortune, of Honour; and who, be&s;ides a gallant Di&s;po&s;ition which inclines Men to Knight-Errantry; that is, to be the Champions of Ladies in Di&s;tre&s;s, had often declared a violent Attachment to her&s;elf, and had already given her all the In&s;tances of it in his Power.</P>
<P>But as the Law hath fooli&s;hly omitted this Office of Vice-Hu&s;band, or Guardian to an eloped Lady and as Malice is apt to denominate him by a more di&s;agreeable Appellation; it was concluded that his Lord&s;hip &s;hould perform all &s;uch kind Offices to the Lady in &s;ecret, and without publickly a&s;&s;uming the Character of her Protector. Nay, to prevent any other

Per&s;on from &s;eeing him in this Light, it was agreed that the Lady &s;hould proceed directly to <HI>Bath,</HI> and that his Lord&s;hip &s;hould fir&s;t go to <HI>London,</HI> and thence &s;hould go down to that Place by the Advice of his Phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>Now all this <HI>Sophia</HI> very plainly under&s;tood, not from the Lips or Behaviour of Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick;</HI> but from the Peer, who was infinitely le&s;s expert at re|taining a Secret, than was the good Lady; and per|haps the exact Secrecy which Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> had ob&s;erved on this Head in her Narrative, &s;erved not a little to heighten tho&s;e Su&s;picions which were now ri&s;en in the Mind of her Cou&s;in.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> very ea&s;ily found out the Lady &s;he &s;ought, for indeed there was not a Chairman in Town to whom her Hou&s;e was not perfectly well known; and as &s;he received, in Return of her fir&s;t Me&s;&s;age, a mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing Invitation, &s;he immediately accepted it. Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> indeed did not de&s;ire her Cou&s;in to &s;tay with her with more earne&s;tne&s;s than Civility required. Whether &s;he had di&s;cerned and re&s;ented the Su&s;picion above-mentioned, or from what other Motive it a|ro&s;e, I cannot &s;ay; but certain it is, &s;he was full as de&s;irous of parting with <HI>Sophia,</HI> as <HI>Sophia</HI> her&s;elf could be of going.</P>
<P>The young Lady, when &s;he came to take Leave of her Cou&s;in, could not avoid giving her a &s;hort Hint of Advice. She begged her, for Heaven's Sake, to take Care of her&s;elf, and to con&s;ider in how dan|gerous a Situation &s;he &s;tood; adding, &s;he hoped &s;ome Method would be found of reconciling her to her Hu&s;band. <Q REND="inline">'You mu&s;t remember, my Dear, &s;ays &s;he, the Maxim which my Aunt <HI>We&s;tern</HI> hath &s;o often repeated to us both; <HI>That whenever the Ma|trimonial Alliance is broke, and War declared be|tween Husband and Wife, &s;he can hardly make a di&s;|advantageous Peace for her&s;elf on any Conditions.</HI>
<PB N="340" REF="349">
The&s;e are my Aunt's very Words, and &s;he hath had a great deal of Experience in the World.'</Q> Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> an&s;wered, with a contemptuous Smile, <Q REND="inline">'Never fear me, Child, take Care of your&s;elf; for you are younger than me. I will come and vi&s;it you in a few Days; but, dear <HI>Sophy,</HI> let me give you one Piece of Advice: Leave the Character of <HI>Graveairs</HI> in the Country; for, believe me it will &s;it very aukwardly upon you in this Town.'</Q></P>
<P>Thus the two Cou&s;ins parted, and <HI>Sophia</HI> repaired directly to Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton,</HI> where &s;he found a mo&s;t hearty, as well as mo&s;t polite Welcome. The La|dy had taken a great Fancy to her when &s;he had &s;een her formerly with her Aunt <HI>We&s;tern.</HI> She was indeed extremely glad to &s;ee her, and was no &s;ooner acquaint|ed with the Rea&s;ons which induced her to leave the Squire and fly to <HI>London,</HI> than &s;he highly applauded her Sen&s;e and Re&s;olution; and after expre&s;&s;ing the highe&s;t Satisfaction in the Opinion which <HI>Sophia</HI> had declared &s;he entertained of her Lady&s;hip, by chu&s;ing her Hou&s;e for an A&s;ylum, &s;he promi&s;ed her all the Protection which it was in her Power to give.</P>
<P>As we have now brought <HI>Sophia</HI> into &s;afe Hands, the Reader will, I apprehend, be contented to depo&s;ite her there a while, and to look a little after other Per|&s;onages, and particularly poor <HI>Jones,</HI> whom we have left long enough to do Penance for his pa&s;t Offences, which, as is the Nature of Vice, brought &s;ufficient Puni&s;hment upon him them&s;elves.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">BOOK XII. <HI>Containing the &s;ame individual Time with the former.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Shewing what is to be deemed Plagiari&s;m in a modern Author, and what is to be con&s;idered as lawful Prize.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE learned Reader mu&s;t have ob&s;erved, that in the Cour&s;e of this mighty Work, I have often tran&s;lated Pa&s;&s;ages out of the be&s;t antient Authors, without quoting the Original, or without taking the lea&s;t Notice of the Book from whence they were borrowed.</P>
<P>This Conduct in Writing is placed in a proper Light by the ingenious Abbe <HI>Bannier,</HI> in his Preface to his Mythology, a Work of great Erudition, and of equal Judgment. <Q REND="inline">'It will be ea&s;y,' &s;ays he, 'for the Reader to ob&s;erve, that I have frequently had greater Regard to him, than to my own Reputa|tion: For an Author certainly pays him a con&s;ider|able

Compliment, when, for his Sake, he &s;up|pre&s;&s;es learned Quotations that come in his Way, and which would have co&s;t him but the bare Trou|ble of tran&s;lating.'</Q></P>
<P>To fill up a Work with the&s;e Scraps may indeed be con&s;idered as a downright Cheat on the learned World, who are by &s;uch Means impo&s;ed upon to buy a &s;econd Time in Fragments and by Retail what they have already in Gro&s;s, if not in their Memories, up|on their Shelves; and it is &s;till more cruel upon the Illiterate, who are drawn in to pay for what is of no manner of U&s;e to them. A Writer who intermixes great Quaintity of <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> with his Works, deals by the Ladies and fine Gentlemen in the &s;ame paultry Manner with which they are treated by the Auctioneers, who often endeavour &s;o to confound and mix up their Lots, that, in order to purcha&s;e the Com|modity you want, you are obliged at the &s;ame Time to purcha&s;e that which will do you no Service.</P>
<P>And yet as there is no Conduct &s;o fair and di&s;inte|re&s;ted, but that it may be mi&s;under&s;tood by Ignorance, and mi&s;repre&s;ented by Malice, I have been &s;ome|times tempted to pre&s;erve my own Reputation, at the Expence of my Reader, and to tran&s;cribe the Origi|nal, or at lea&s;t to quote Chapter and Ver&s;e, when|ever I have made U&s;e either of the Thought or Ex|pre&s;&s;ion of another. I am indeed in &s;ome Doubt that I have often &s;uffered by that contrary Method; and that by &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the original Author's Name, I have been rather &s;u&s;pected of Plagiari&s;m, than re|puted to act from the amiable Motive above-a&s;&s;igned by that ju&s;tly celebrated <HI>Frenchman.</HI></P>
<P>Now to obviate all &s;uch Imputations for the future, I do here confe&s;s and ju&s;tify the Fact. The Ancients may be con&s;idered as a rich Common, where every Per&s;on who hath the &s;malle&s;t Tenement in <HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI> hath a free Right to fatten his Mu&s;e. Or, to place it in a clearer Light, we Moderns are to the Antients
<PB N="343" REF="352">
what the Poor are to the Rich. By the Poor here I mean, that large and venerable Body which, in <HI>En|gli&s;h,</HI> we call The Mob. Now, whoever hath had the Honour to be admitted to any Degree of Intima|cy with this Mob, mu&s;t well know that it is one of their e&s;tabli&s;hed Maxims, to plunder and pillage their rich Neighbours without any Reluctance; and that this is held to be neither Sin nor Shame among them. And &s;o con&s;tantly do they abide and act by this Max|im, that in every Pari&s;h almo&s;t in the Kingdom, there is a Kind of Confederacy ever carrying on again&s;t a certain Per&s;on of Opulence called the Squire, who&s;e Property is con&s;idered as Free-Booty by all his poor Neighbours; who, as they conclude that there is no Manner of Guilt in &s;uch Depredations, look upon it is a Point of Honour and moral Obligation to con|ceal, and to pre&s;erve each other from Puni&s;hment on all &s;uch Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>In like Manner are the Ancients, &s;uch as <HI>Homer, Virgil, Horace, Cicero,</HI> and the re&s;t, to be e&s;teemed among us Writers, as &s;o many wealthy Squires, from whom we, the Poor of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> claim an imme|morial Cu&s;tom of taking whatever we can come at. This Liberty I demand, and this I am as ready to al|low again to my poor Neighbours in their Turn. All profe&s;s, and all I require from my Brethren, is to maintain the &s;ame &s;trict Hone&s;ty among our&s;elves, which the Mob &s;hew to one another. To &s;teal from one another, is indeed highly criminal and indecent; for this may be &s;trictly &s;tiled defrauding the Poor &s;ometimes perhaps tho&s;e who are poorer than our|&s;elves) or to &s;ee it under the mo&s;t opprobrious Colours, robbing the Spittal.</P>
<P>Since therefore upon the &s;tricte&s;t Examination, my own Con&s;cience cannot lay any &s;uch pitiful Theft to my Charge, I am contented to plead guilty to the for|mer Accu&s;ation; nor &s;hall I ever &s;cruple to take to my &s;elf any Pa&s;&s;age which I &s;hall find in an ancient Author
<PB N="344" REF="353">
to my Purpo&s;e, without &s;etting down the Name of the Author from whence it was taken. Nay, I ab&s;o|lutely claim a Property in all &s;uch Sentiments the Moment they are tran&s;cribed into my Writings, and I expect all Readers henceforward to regard them as purely and entirely my own. This Claim however I de&s;ire to be allowed me only on Condition, that I pre&s;erve &s;trict Hone&s;ty towards my poor Brethren, from whom if ever I borrow any of that little of which they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, I &s;hall never fail to put their Mark upon it, that it may be at all Times ready to be re&s;tored to the right Owner.</P>
<P>The Omi&s;&s;ion of this was highly blameable in one Mr. <HI>Moore,</HI> who having formerly borrowed &s;ome Lines of <HI>Pope</HI> and Company, took the Liberty to tran&s;cribe &s;ix of them into his Play of the <HI>Rival Modes.</HI> Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> however very luckily found them in the &s;aid Play, and laying violent Hands on his own Property, transferred it back again into his own Works; and for a further Puni&s;hment, impri&s;oned the &s;aid <HI>Moore</HI> in the loath&s;ome Dungeon of the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> where his unhappy Memory now remains, and eternally will remain, as a proper Puni&s;hment for &s;uch his un|ju&s;t Dealings in the poetical Trade.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>In which, tho' the Squire doth not find his Daughter, &s;omething is found which puts an End to his Pur&s;uit.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Hi&s;tory now returns to the Inn at <HI>Upton,</HI> whence we &s;hall fir&s;t trace the Foot&s;teps of Squire <HI>We&s;tern;</HI> for as he will &s;oon arrive at an End of his Journey, we &s;hall have then full Lei&s;ure to attend our Heroe.</P>
<P>The Reader may be plea&s;ed to remember, that the &s;aid Squire departed from the Inn in great Fury, and in that Fury he pur&s;ued his Daughter. The Ho&s;tler having informed him that &s;he had cro&s;&s;ed the <HI>Severn,</HI>
<PB N="345" REF="354">
he likewi&s;e pa&s;t that River with his Equipage, and rode full Speed, vowing the utmo&s;t Vengeance again&s;t poor <HI>Sophia,</HI> if he &s;hould but overtake her.</P>
<P>He had not gone far, before he arrived at a Cro&s;s|way. Here he called a &s;hort Council of War, in which, after hearing different Opinions, he at la&s;t gave the Direction of his Pur&s;uit to Fortune, and &s;truck directly into the <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> Road.</P>
<P>In this Road he proceeded about two Miles, when he began to bemoan him&s;elf mo&s;t bitterly, frequently crying out, <Q REND="inline">'What Pity is it! Sure never was &s;o un|lucky a Dog as my&s;elf! and then bur&s;t forth a Vol|ley of Oaths and Execrations.'</Q></P>
<P>The Par&s;on attempted to admini&s;ter Comfort to him on this Occa&s;ion. <Q REND="inline">'Sorrow not, Sir,' &s;ays he, like tho&s;e without Hope. Howbeit we have not yet been able to overtake young Madam, we may ac|count it &s;ome good Fortune, that we have hitherto traced her Cour&s;e aright. Peradventure &s;he will &s;oon be fatigated with her Journey, and will tarry in &s;ome Inn, in order to renovate her corporeal Functions; and in that Ca&s;e, in all moral Certain|ty, you will very briefly be <HI>compos voti.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Pogh! D&mdash;n the Slut,' an&s;wered the Squire, I am lamenting the Lo&s;s of &s;o fine a Morning for Hunting. It is confounded hard to lo&s;e one of the be&s;t Scenting Days, in all Appearance, which hath been this Sea&s;on, and e&s;pecially after &s;o long a Fro&s;t.'</Q></P>
<P>Whether Fortune, who now and then &s;hews &s;ome Compa&s;&s;ion in her wantone&s;t Tricks, might not take Pity of the Squire; and as &s;he had detirmined not to let him overtake his Daughter, might not re&s;olve to make him Amends &s;ome other Way, I will not a&s;|&s;ert; but he had hardly uttered the Words ju&s;t before commemorated, and two or three Oaths at their Heels, when a Pack of Hounds began to open their melodious Throats at a &s;mall Di&s;tance from them, which the Squire's Hor&s;e and his Rider both perceiv|ing,
<PB N="346" REF="355">
both immediately pricked up their Ears, and the Squire crying, 'She's gone, &s;he's gone!' Damn me 'if &s;he is not gone!' in&s;tantly clapped Spurs to the Bea&s;t, who little needed it, having indeed the &s;ame Inclination with his Ma&s;ter; and now the whole Com|pany cro&s;ing into a Corn field, rode directly towards the Hounds, with much Hollowing and Hooping, while the poor Par&s;on, ble&s;&s;ing him&s;elf, brought up the Rear.</P>
<P>Thus Fable reports, that the fair <HI>Grimalkin,</HI> whom <HI>Venus,</HI> at the De&s;ire of a pa&s;&s;ionate Lover, converted from a Cat into a fine Woman, no &s;ooner perceived a Mou&s;e, than mindful of her former Sport, and &s;till retaining her pri&s;tine Nature, &s;he lept from the Bed of her Hu&s;band to pur&s;ue the little Animal.</P>
<P>What are we to under&s;tand by this? Not that the Bride was di&s;plea&s;ed with the Embraces of her amorous Bridegroom: For tho' &s;ome have remarked that Cats are &s;ubject to Ingratitude, yet Women and Cats too will be plea&s;ed and purr on certain Occa&s;ions. The Truth is, as the &s;agacious Sir <HI>Roger L'E&s;trange</HI> ob|&s;erves, in his deep Reflections, that <Q REND="inline">'if we &s;hut Nature out at the Door, &s;he will come in at the Window; and that Pu&s;s, tho' a Madam, will be a Mou&s;er &s;till.'</Q> In the &s;ame Manner we are not to arraign the Squire of any Want of Love for his Daugh|ter: For in reality he had a great deal; we are only to con&s;ider that he was a Squire and a Sport&s;man, and then we may apply the Fable to him, and the judi|cious Reflections likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>The Hounds ran very hard, as it is called, and the Squire pur&s;ued over Hedge and Ditch, with all his u&s;ual Vociferation and Alacrity, and with all his u&s;ual Plea&s;ure; nor did the Thoughts of <HI>Sophia</HI> ever once intrude them&s;elves to allay the Satisfaction he enjoyed in the Chace, which, he &s;aid, was one of the fine&s;t he ever &s;aw, and which he &s;wore was very well worth going fifty Miles for. As the Squire forgot his
<PB N="347" REF="356">
Daughter, the Servants, we may ea&s;ily believe, for|got their Mi&s;tre&s;s; and the Par&s;on, after having ex|pre&s;s'd much A&s;toni&s;hment in <HI>Latin</HI> to him&s;elf, at length likewi&s;e abandoned all farther Thoughts of the young Lady, and jogging on at a Di&s;tance behind, began to meditate a Portion of Doctrine for the en|&s;uing <HI>Sunday.</HI></P>
<P>The Squire who owned the Hounds was highly plea&s;ed with the Arrival of his Brother Squire and Sport&s;man: For all Men approve Merit in their own Way, and no Man was more expert in the Field than Mr. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> nor did any other better know how to encourage the Dogs with his Voice, and to animate the Hunt with his Holla.</P>
<P>Sport&s;men, in the Warmth of a Chace, are too much engaged to attend to any Manner of Ceremo|ny; nay, even to the Office of Humanity: For if any of them meet with an Accident by tumbling into a Ditch, or into a River, the re&s;t pa&s;s on regardle&s;s, and generally leave him to his Fate; during this Time, therefore, the two Squires, tho' often clo&s;e to each other, interchanged not a &s;ingle Word. The Ma&s;|ter of the Hunt, however, often &s;aw and approved the great Judgment of the Stranger in drawing the Dogs when they were at a Fault, and hence conceived a very high Opinion of his Under&s;tanding, as the Number of his Attendants in&s;pired no &s;mall Reverence to his Quality. As &s;oon therefore as the Sport was ended by the Death of the little Animal which had occa&s;ioned it, the two Squires met, and in all Squire-like Greeting, &s;aluted each other.</P>
<P>The Conver&s;ation was entertaining enough, and what we may perhaps relate in an Appendix, or on &s;ome other Occa&s;ion; but as it nowi&s;e concerns this Hi&s;tory, we cannot prevail on our&s;elves to give it a Place here. It concluded with a &s;econd Chace, and that with an Invitation to Dinner. This being ac|cepted, was followed by a hearty Bout of Drinking,
<PB N="348" REF="357">
which ended in as hearty a Nap on the Part of Squire <HI>We&s;tern.</HI></P>
<P>Our Squire was by no Means a Match either for his Ho&s;t, or for Par&s;on <HI>Supple,</HI> at his Cups that Evening; for which the violent Fatigue of Mind as well as Bo|dy that he had undergone, may very well account, without the lea&s;t Derogation from his Honour. He was indeed, according to the vulgar Phra&s;e, whi&s;tled drunk; for before he had &s;wallowed the third Bottle, he became &s;o entirely overpowered, that tho' he was not carried off to Bed till long after, the Par&s;on con|&s;idered him as ab&s;ent, and having acquainted the other Squire with all relating to <HI>Sophia,</HI> he obtained his Promi&s;e of &s;econding tho&s;e Arguments which he intended to urge the next Morning for Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI>'s Return.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner therefore had the good Squire &s;haken off his Evening, and began to call for his Morning Draught, and to &s;ummon his Hor&s;es in order to renew his Pur|&s;uit, than Mr. <HI>Supple</HI> began his Di&s;&s;ua&s;ives; which the Ho&s;t &s;o &s;trongly &s;econded, that they at length prevailed, and Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> agreed to return home; being principally moved by one Argument, <HI>viz.</HI> That he knew not which Way to go, and might probably be riding farther from his Daughter in&s;tead of towards her. He then took Leave of his Brother Sport&s;man, and expre&s;&s;ing great Joy that the Fro&s;t was broken (which might perhaps be no &s;mall Motive to his ha&s;|tening home) &s;et forwards, or rather backwards, for <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire;</HI> but not before he di&s;patched Part of his Retinue in que&s;t of his Daughter, after whom he likewi&s;e &s;ent a Volley of the mo&s;t bitter Execrations which he could invent.</P>

<P>AT length we are once more come to our He|roe; and to &s;ay Truth, we have been obliged to part with him &s;o long, that con&s;idering the Con|dition in which we left him, I apprehend many of our Readers have concluded we intended to aban|don him for ever; he being at pre&s;ent in that Situa|tion in which prudent People u&s;ually de&s;i&s;t from en|quiring any farther after their Friends, le&s;t they &s;hould be &s;hocked by hearing &s;uch Friends had hanged them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>But, in reality, if we have not all the Virtues, I will boldly &s;ay, neither have we all the Vices of a prudent Character; and tho' it is not ea&s;y to conceive Circum&s;tances much more mi&s;erable than tho&s;e of poor <HI>Jones</HI> at pre&s;ent, we &s;hall return to him, and at|tend upon him with the &s;ame Diligence as if he was wantoning in the brighte&s;t Beams <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> Fortune.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> then, and his Companion <HI>Partridge,</HI> left the Inn a few Minutes after the Departure of Squire <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> and pur&s;ued the &s;ame Road on Foot; for the O&s;tler told them, that no Hor&s;es were by any Means to be at that Time procured at <HI>Upton.</HI> On they marched with heavy Hearts; for tho' their Di&s;quiet proceeded from very different Rea&s;ons, yet di&s;plea&s;ed they were both; and if <HI>Jones</HI> &s;ighed bitterly, <HI>Par|tridge</HI> grunted altogether as &s;adly every Step.</P>
<P>When they came to the Cro&s;s-roads where the Squire had &s;topt to take Council, <HI>Jones</HI> &s;topt likewi&s;e, and turning to <HI>Partridge,</HI> a&s;ked his Opinion which Track they &s;hould pur&s;ue. <Q REND="inline">Ah, Sir!' an&s;wered <HI>Par|tridge,</HI> I wi&s;h your Honour would follow my Ad|vice.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Why &s;hould I not?' replied <HI>Jones;</HI> for it is now indifferent to me whither I go, or what

<P><Q REND="inline">'Alas! cries <HI>Jones,</HI> I have no Home to return to;&mdash;but if my Friend, my Father would receive me, could I bear the Country from which <HI>Sophia</HI> is flown&mdash;Cruel <HI>Sophia!</HI> Cruel!

<P><HI>Partridge</HI> fell trembling on his Knees, and begged for Mercy, vowing he had meant no Harm&mdash;when <HI>Jones,</HI> after &s;taring wildly on him for a Moment, quitted his Hold; and di&s;charged a Rage on him&s;elf, that had it fallen on the other, would certainly have put an End to his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eing, which indeed the very Ap|prehen&s;ion of it had almo&s;t effected.</P>
<P>We would be&s;tow &s;ome Pains here in minutely de|&s;cribing all the mad Pranks which <HI>Jones</HI> played on this Occa&s;ion, could we be well a&s;&s;ured that the Reader would take the &s;ame Pains in peru&s;ing them; but as we are appprehen&s;ive that after all the Labour which we &s;hould employ in painting this Scene, the &s;aid Reader would be very apt to &s;kip it entirely over, we have &s;aved our&s;elves that Trouble. To &s;ay the Truth, we have, from this Rea&s;on alone, often done great Violence to the Luxuriance of our Genius, and have left many excellent De&s;criptions out of our Work, which would otherwi&s;e have been in it. And this Su&s;|picion, to be hone&s;t, ari&s;es, as is generally the Ca&s;e, from our own wicked Heart; for we have, our&s;elves, been very often mo&s;t horridly given to jumping, as we have run through the Pages of voluminous Hi&s;torians.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="360">
Suffice it then &s;imply to &s;ay, that <HI>Jones,</HI> after hav|ing played the Part of a Madam for many Minutes, came, by Degrees, to him&s;elf; which no &s;ooner hap|pened, than turning to <HI>Partridge,</HI> he very earne&s;tly begged his Pardon for the Attack he had made on him in the Violence of his Pa&s;&s;ion; but concluded, by de&s;iring him never to mention his Return again; for he was re&s;olved never to &s;ee that Country any more.</P>
<P><HI>Partridge</HI> ea&s;ily forgave, and faithfully promi&s;ed to obey the Injunction now laid upon him.

<P>Our Travellers now marched a full Mile, without &s;peaking a Syllable to each other, tho' <HI>Jones,</HI> indeed, muttered many things to him&s;elf; as to <HI>Partridge,</HI> he was profoundly &s;ilent: For he was not, per|haps, perfectly recovered from his former Fright; be&s;ides, he had Apprehen&s;ions of provoking his Friend to a &s;econd Fit of Wrath; e&s;pecially as he now be|gan to entertain a Conceit, which may not, perhaps, create any great Wonder in the Reader. In &s;hort, he began now to &s;u&s;pect that <HI>Jones</HI> was ab&s;olutely out of his Sen&s;es.</P>
<P>At length <HI>Jones</HI> being weary of Soliloquy, ad|dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to his Companion, and blamed him for his Taciturnity: For which the poor Man very hone&s;tly accounted, from his Fear of giving Of|fence.

<P>As <HI>Partridge</HI> was inhibited from that Topic which would have fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted it&s;elf, he fell upon that which was next uppermo&s;t in his Mind, namely, the Man of the Hill. <Q REND="inline">'Certainly, Sir, &s;ays he, that could never be a Man, who dre&s;&s;es him&s;elf, and lives after &s;uch a &s;trange Manner, and &s;o unlike other Folks.

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>The Adventure of a Beggar-Man.</HI></HEAD>
<P>JUST as <HI>Partridge</HI> had uttered that good and pious Doctrine, with which the la&s;t Chapter con|cluded, they arrived at another Cro&s;s-way, when a lame Fellow in Rags, a&s;ked them for Alms; upon which <HI>Partridge</HI> gave him a &s;evere Rebuke, &s;aying, 'Every Pari&s;h ought to keep their own Poor.' <HI>Jones</HI> then fell a laughing, and a&s;ked <HI>Partridge,</HI> if he was not a&s;hamed with &s;o much Charity in his Mouth to have no Charity in his Heart. <Q REND="inline">'Your Religion, &s;ays he, &s;erves you only for an Excu&s;e for your Faults, but is no Incentive to your Virtue. Can any Man who is really a Chri&s;tian ab&s;tain from relieving one of his Brethren in &s;uch a mi&s;erable Condition?'</Q> and at the &s;ame time putting his Hand in his Pocket, he gave the poor Object a Shilling.</P>
<P>'Ma&s;ter,' cries the fellow, after thanking him, <Q REND="inline">'I have a curious Thing here in my Pocket, which I found about two Miles off, if your Wor&s;hip will plea&s;e to buy it. I &s;hould not venture to pull it out to every one; but as you are &s;o good a Gen|tleman, and &s;o kind to the Poor, you won't &s;u&s;|pect a Man of being a Thief only becau&s;e he is poor.'</Q> He then pulled out a little gilt Pocket-book, and delivered it into the Hands of <HI>Jones.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> pre&s;ently opened it, and (gue&s;s, Reader, what he felt,) &s;aw in the fir&s;t Page the Words <HI>Sophia We&s;|tern,</HI> written by her own fair Hand. He no &s;ooner read the Name, than he pre&s;t it clo&s;e to his Lips; nor could he avoid falling into &s;ome very frantick Rap|tures,
<PB N="356" REF="365">
notwit&s;tanding his Company; but, perhaps, the&s;e very Raptures made him forget he was not alone.</P>
<P>While <HI>Jones</HI> was ki&s;&s;ing and mumbling the Book, as if he had an Excellent brown butter'd Cru&s;t in his Mouth, or as if he had been really a Bookworm, or an Author, who hath nothing to eat but his own Works, a Piece of Paper fell from its Leaves to the Ground, which <HI>Partridge</HI> took up, and delivered to <HI>Jones,</HI> who pre&s;ently perceived it to be a Bank-bill. It was, indeed, the very Bill which <HI>We&s;tern</HI> had given his Daughter, the Night before her Departure; and a <HI>Jew</HI> would have jumped to purcha&s;e it at five Shil|llngs le&s;s than <HI>100l.</HI></P>
<P>The Eyes of <HI>Partridge</HI> &s;parkled at this News, which <HI>Jones</HI> now proclaimed aloud; and &s;o did (tho' with &s;omewhat a different A&s;pect) tho&s;e of the poor Fel|low who had found the Book; and who (I hope from a Principle of Hone&s;ty) had never opened it: But we &s;hould not deal hone&s;tly by the Reader, if we omitted to inform him of a Circum&s;tance, which may be here a little material, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Fellow could not read.</P>
<P><HI>Jones,</HI> who had felt nothing but pure Joy and Tran&s;port from the finding the Book, was affected with a Mixture of Concern at this new Di&s;covery: For his Imagination in&s;tantly &s;ugge&s;ted to him, that the Owner of the Bill might po&s;&s;ibly want it, before he could be able to convey it to her. He then ac|quainted the Finder, that he knew the Lady to whom the Book belonged, and would endeavour to find her out as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and return it her.</P>
<P>The Pocket-Book was a late Pre&s;ent from Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> to her Neice: It had co&s;t five and twenty Shil|lings, having been bought of a celebrated Toyman, but the real Value of the Silver, which it contained in its cla&s;p, was about <HI>18d.</HI> and that Price the &s;aid
<PB N="357" REF="366">
Toyman, as it was altogether as good as when it fir&s;t i&s;&s;ued from his Shop, would now have given for it. A prudent Per&s;on would, however, have taken proper Advantage of the Ignorance of this Fel|low, and would not have offered more than a Shil|ling, or perhaps Sixpence for it; nay, &s;ome perhaps would have given nothing, and left the Fellow to his Action of Trover, which &s;ome learned Serjeants may doubt whether he could, under the&s;e Circum&s;tances, have maintained.</P>
<P><HI>Jones,</HI> on the contrary, who&s;e Character was on the out&s;ide of Genero&s;ity, and may perhaps not very unju&s;tly have been &s;u&s;pected of Extravagance, without any He&s;itation, gave a Guinea in Exchange for the Book. The poor man, who had not for a long Time before, been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o much Trea&s;ure, gave Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> a thou&s;and Thanks, and di&s;covered little le&s;s of Tran&s;port in his Mu&s;cles, than <HI>Jones</HI> had before &s;hewn, when he had fir&s;t read the Name of <HI>Sophia We&s;tern.</HI></P>
<P>The Fellow very readily agreed to attend our Tra|vellers to the Place where he had found the Pocket-Book. Together, therefore, they proceeded direct|ly thither; but not &s;o fa&s;t as Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> de&s;ired; for his Guide unfortunately happened to be lame, and could not po&s;&s;ibly travel fa&s;ter than a Mile an Hour. As this Place, therefore, was at above three Miles Di&s;tance, though the Fellow had &s;aid otherwi&s;e, the Reader need not be acquainted how long they were in walking it.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> opened the Book a hundred Times during their Walk, ki&s;&s;ed it as often, talked much to him&s;elf, and very little to his Companions. At all which the Guide expre&s;t &s;ome Signs of A&s;toni&s;hment to <HI>Par|tridge;</HI> who more than once &s;hook his Head, and cry'd, poor Gentleman! <HI>orandum e&s;t ut &s;it mens &s;ana in corpore &s;ano</HI></P>
<P><PB N="358" REF="367">
At length, they arrived at the very Spot, where <HI>So|phia</HI> unhappily dropt the Pocket-Book, and where the Fellow had as happily found it.

<P>OUR Travellers now walked &s;o fa&s;t, that they had very little Time or Breath for Conver&s;ation; <HI>Jones</HI> meditating all the Way on <HI>Sophia,</HI> and <HI>Partridge</HI> on the Bank-Bill, which though it gave him &s;ome Plea&s;ure, cau&s;ed him at the &s;ame Time to repine at Fortune, which, in all his Walks, had never given him &s;uch an Opportunity of &s;hewing his Hone&s;ty, They had proceeded above three Miles, when <HI>Par|tridge</HI> being unable any longer to keep up with <HI>Jones,</HI> called to him, and begged him a little to &s;lacken his Pace; with this he was the more ready to comply, as he had for &s;ome Time lo&s;t the Foot&s;teps of the Hor&s;es, which the Thaw had enabled him to trace during &s;e|veral Miles, and he was now upon a wide Common where were &s;everal Roads.</P>
<P>He here therefore &s;topt to con&s;ider which of the&s;e Roads he &s;hould pur&s;ue, when on a &s;udden they heard the Noi&s;e of a Drum that &s;eemed at no great Di&s;tance. This Sound pre&s;ently alarmed the Fears of <HI>Partridge,</HI> and he cried out, 'Lord have Mercy upon us all; 'they are certainly a coming!' 'Who is coming?' cries <HI>Jones,</HI> for Fear had long &s;ince given Place to &s;of|ter Ideas in his Mind, and &s;ince his Adventure with the lame Man, he had been totally intent on pur&s;uing <HI>Sophia,</HI> without entertaining one Thought of an Ene|my.

<P>And now <HI>Partridge,</HI> who kept even Pace with <HI>Jones,</HI> di&s;covered &s;omething painted flying in the Air, very few Yards before him, which fancying to be the Colours of the Enemy, he fell a bellowing, 'O Lord Sir, here they are, there is the Crown and Coffin.

A grave Matron told the Ma&s;ter &s;he would bring her two Daughters the next Night, as he did not &s;hew any Stuff; and an Attorney's Clerk, and an Exci&s;eman, both declared, that the Characters of Lord and Lady <HI>Townly</HI> were well pre&s;erved, and high|ly in Nature. <HI>Partridge</HI> likewi&s;e concurred with this Opinion.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;ter was &s;o highly elated with the&s;e Enco|miums, that he could not refrain from adding &s;ome more of his own. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'The pre&s;ent Age was not improved in any Thing &s;o much as in their Puppet-&s;hows; which, by throwing out Punch and his Wife <HI>Joan,</HI> and &s;uch idle Trumpery, were at la&s;t brought to be a rational Entertainment. I remember,' &s;aid he, 'when I fir&s;t took to the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, there was a great deal of low Stuff that did very well to make Folks laugh; but was never cal|culated to improve the Morals of young People, which certainly ought to be principally aimed at in every Puppet-&s;how: For why may not good and in&s;tructive Le&s;&s;ons be conveyed this Way, as well as any other? My Figures are as big as the Life, and they repre&s;ent the Life in every particular; and I que&s;tion not but People ri&s;e from my little <HI>Drama</HI> as much improved as they do from the great.

<P>The Dancer of Wires conceived an immediate and high Contempt for <HI>Jones,</HI> from the&s;e Words. And with much Di&s;dain in his Countenance, he replied, <Q REND="inline">'Very probably, Sir, that may be your Opinion; but I have the Satisfaction to know the be&s;t Judges differ from you, and it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e every Ta&s;te. I confe&s;s, indeed, &s;ome of the Quality at <HI>Bath,</HI> two or three Years ago, wanted mightily to bring Punch again upon the Stage. I believe I lo&s;t &s;ome Money for not agreeing to it; but let others do as they will, a little Matter &s;hall never bribe me to degrade my own Profe&s;&s;ion, nor will I ever wil|lingly con&s;ent to the &s;poiling the Decency and Re|gularity of my Stage, by introducing any &s;uch low Stuff upon it.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Right, Friend, cries the Clerk, you are very right. Always avoid what is low. There are &s;e|veral of my Acquaintance in <HI>London,</HI> who are re|&s;olved to drive every Thing which is low from the Stage.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Nothing can be more proper,' cries the Exci&s;eman, pulling his Pipe from his Mouth. 'I remember, added he, (for I then lived with my Lord) I was in the Footman's Gallery, the Night when this Play of the Provok'd Hu&s;band was acted fir&s;t. There was a great deal of low Stuff in it about a Country Gentleman come up to Town to &s;tand for Parliament Man; and there they brought a Parcel of his Servants upon the Stage, his Coach|man I remember particularly; but the Gentlemen in our Gallery could not bear any thing &s;o low, and they damned it.

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. <HI>From which it may be inferred, that the be&s;t Things are liable to be mi&s;under&s;tood and mi&s;interpreted.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A Violent Uproar now aro&s;e in the Entry, where my Landlady was well cuffing her Maid both with her Fi&s;t and Tongue. She had indeed mi&s;&s;ed the Wench from her Employment, and, after a little Search, had found her on the Puppet-&s;how Stage in Company with the <HI>Merry Andrew,</HI> and in a Situati|on not very proper to be de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Tho' <HI>Grace</HI> (for that was her Name) had forfeited all Title to Mode&s;ty, yet had &s;he not Impudence e|nough to deny a Fact in which &s;he was actually &s;urpriz|ed; &s;he therefore took another Turn, and attempted to mitigate the Offence. <Q REND="inline">'Why do you beat me in this Manner, Mi&s;tre&s;s? cries the Wench. If you don't like my Doings, you may turn me away. If I am a W&mdash;e (for the other had liberally be|&s;towed that Appellation on her) my Betters are &s;o as well as I?

ju&s;t now. I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he did not lie all Night out from her Hu&s;band for nothing.'</Q></P>
<P>The Landlady now bur&s;t into the Kitchen, and fell foul on both her Hu&s;band and the poor Puppet-mover. <Q REND="inline">'Here, Hu&s;band, &s;ays &s;he, you &s;ee the Con&s;e|quence of harbouring the&s;e People in your Hou&s;e. If one doth draw a little Drink the more for them, one is hardly made Amends for the Litter they make; and then to have one's Hou&s;e made a Baw|dyhou&s;e of by &s;uch lou&s;y Vermin. In &s;hort, I de&s;ire you would be gone to-morrow Morning; for I will tolerate no more &s;uch Doings. It is only the Way to teach our Servants Idlene&s;s and Non&s;en&s;e; for to be &s;ure nothing better can be learned by &s;uch idle Shows as the&s;e. I remember when Puppet-&s;hows were made of good Scripture Stories, as <HI>Jephtha</HI>'s Ra&s;h Vow, and &s;uch good Things, and when wick|ed People were carried away by the Devil. There was &s;ome Sen&s;e in tho&s;e Matters; but as the Par|&s;on told us la&s;t <HI>Sunday,</HI> nobody believes in the Devil now-a-days; and here you bring about a Parcel of Puppets dre&s;t up like Lords and Ladies, only to turn the Heads of poor Country Wenches, and when their Heads are once turned top&s;y turvy, no wonder every thing el&s;e is &s;o.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Virgil,</HI> I think, tells us, that when the Mob are a&s;&s;embled in a riotous and tumultuous Manner, and all Sorts of mi&s;&s;ible Weapons fly about, if a Man of Gravity and Authority appears among&s;t them, the Tumult is pre&s;ently appea&s;ed, and the Mob, which when collected into one Body, may be well compared to an A&s;s, erect their long Ears at the grave Man's Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>On the contrary, when a Set of grave Men and Philo&s;ophers are di&s;puting; when Wi&s;dom her&s;elf may in a Manner be con&s;idered as pre&s;ent, and admi|ni&s;tring Arguments to the Di&s;putants, &s;hould a Tu|mult ari&s;e among the Mob, or &s;hould one Scold who
<PB N="367" REF="376">
is her&s;elf equal in Noi&s;e to a mighty Mob, appear a|mong the &s;aid Philo&s;ophers; their Di&s;putes cea&s;e in a Moment, Wi&s;dom no longer performs her mini&s;terial Office, and the Attention of every one is immediate|ly attracted by the Scold alone.</P>
<P>Thus the Uproar afore&s;aid, and the Arrival of the Landlady, &s;ilenced the Ma&s;ter of the Puppet-&s;hew, and put a &s;peedy and final End to that grave and &s;olemn Harangue, of which we have given the Reader a &s;uf|ficient Ta&s;te already. Nothing indeed could have happened &s;o very inopportune as this Accident; the mo&s;t wanton Malice of Fortune could not have con|trived &s;uch another Stratagem to confound the poor Fellow, while he was &s;o triumphantly de&s;canting on the good Morals inculcated by his Exhibitions. His Mouth was now as effectually &s;topt, as that of a Quack mu&s;t be, if in the Mid&s;t of a Declamation on the great Virtues of his Pills and Powders, the Corp&s;e of one of his Martyrs &s;hould be brought forth, and de|po&s;ited before the Stage, as a Te&s;timony of his Skill.</P>
<P>In&s;tead, therefore, of an&s;wering my Landlady, the Puppet-&s;how Man ran out to puni&s;h his <HI>Merry An|drew;</HI> and now the Moon beginning to put forth her Silver Light, as the Poets call it (tho' &s;he looked at that Time more like a Piece of Copper) <HI>Jones</HI> called for his Reckoning, and ordered <HI>Partridge,</HI> whom my Landlady had ju&s;t awaked from a profound Nap, to prepare for his Journey; but <HI>Partridge</HI> having lately carried two Points, as my Reader hath &s;een before, was emboldened to attempt a third, which was to pre|vail with <HI>Jones</HI> to take up a Lodging that Evening in the Hou&s;e where he then was. He introduced this with an affected Surprize at the Intention which Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> declared of removing; and after urging many excellent Arguments again&s;t it, he at la&s;t in&s;i&s;ted &s;trong|ly, that it could be to no manner of Purpo&s;e whate|ver: For that unle&s;s <HI>Jones</HI> knew which Way the La|dy was gone, every Step he took might very po&s;&s;ibly
<PB N="368" REF="377">
lead him the farther from her; <Q REND="inline">'for you find Sir, &s;aid he, by all the People in the Hou&s;e, that &s;he is not gone this Way. How much better, therefore, would it be to &s;tay till the Moraing, when we may expect to meet with Some-body to enquire of?'</Q></P>
<P>This la&s;t Argument had indeed &s;ome Effect on <HI>Jones,</HI> and while he was weighing it, the Landlord threw all the Rhetoric of which he was Ma&s;ter into the &s;ame Scale. <Q REND="inline">'Sure, Sir, &s;aid he, your Servant gives you mo&s;t excellent Advice: For who would travel by Night at this Time of the Year?'</Q> He then be|gan in the u&s;ual Stile to trumpet forth the excellent Accommodation which his Hou&s;e afforded; and my Landlady likewi&s;e opened on the Occa&s;ion&mdash;But not to detain the Reader with what is common to every Ho&s;t and Ho&s;te&s;s, it is &s;ufficient to tell him, <HI>Jones</HI> was at la&s;t prevailed on to &s;tay and refre&s;h him&s;elf with a few Hours Re&s;t, which indeed he very much wanted; for he had hardly &s;hut his Eyes &s;ince he had left the Inn where the Accident of the broken Head had hap|pened.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as <HI>Jones</HI> had taken a Re&s;olution to proceed no farther that Night, he pre&s;ently retired to Re&s;t, with his two Bed-fellows the Pocket-Book, and the Muff; but <HI>Partridge,</HI> who at &s;everal Times had re|fre&s;hed him&s;elf with &s;everal Naps, was more inclined to Eating than to Sleeping, and more to Drinking than to either.</P>
<P>And now the Storm which <HI>Grace</HI> had rai&s;ed being at an End, and my Landlady being again reconciled to the Puppet-man, who on his Side forgave the in|decent Reflection which the good Woman in her Pa&s;|&s;ion had ca&s;t on his Performances, a Face of perfect Peace and Tranquillity reigned in the Kitchen; where there a&s;&s;embled round the Fire, the Landlord and Landlady of the Hou&s;e, the Ma&s;ter of the Puppet-&s;how, the Attorney's Clerk, the Exci&s;eman, and the ingenious Mr. <HI>Partridge;</HI> in which Company pa&s;t the
<PB N="369" REF="378">
agreeable Conver&s;ation which will be found in the next Chapter.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VII. <HI>Containing a Remark or two of our own, and many more of the good Company a&s;&s;embled in the Kitchen.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the Pride of <HI>Partridge</HI> did not &s;ub|mit to acknowledge him&s;elf a Servant, yet he conde&s;cended in mo&s;t Particulars to imitate the Man|ners of that Rank. One In&s;tance of this was his greatly magnifying the Fortune of his Companion, as he called <HI>Jones:</HI> &s;uch is a general Cu&s;tom with all Servants among Strangers, as none of them would willingly be thought the Attendent on a Beggar: For the higher the Situation of the Ma&s;ter is, the higher con&s;equently is that of the Man in his own Opinion; the Truth of which Ob&s;ervation appears from the Behaviour of all the Footmen of the Nobility.</P>
<P>But tho' Title and Fortune communicate a Splen|dor all around them, and the Footmen of Men of Qua|lity and of E&s;tate think them&s;elves entitled to a Part of that Re&s;pect which is paid to the Quality and E&s;|tates of their Ma&s;ters; it is clearly otherwi&s;e with Regard to Virtue and Under&s;tanding. The&s;e Advan|tages are &s;trictly per&s;onal, and &s;wallow them&s;elves all the Re&s;pect which is paid to them. To &s;ay the Truth, this is &s;o very little, that they cannot well afford to let any others partake with them. As the&s;e therefore re|flect no Honour on the Dome&s;tic, &s;o neither is he at all di&s;honoured by the mo&s;t deplorable Want of both in his Ma&s;ter. Indeed it is otherwi&s;e in the Want of what is called Virtue in a Mi&s;tre&s;s, the Con&s;equence of which we have before &s;een: For in this Di&s;honour there is a Kind of Contagion, which, like that of Poverty, communicates it&s;elf to all who approach it.</P>
<P>Now for the&s;e Rea&s;ons we are not to wonder that Servants (I mean among the Men only) &s;hould have
<PB N="370" REF="379">
&s;o great Regard for the Reputation of the Wealth of their Ma&s;ters, and little or none at all for their Cha|racter in other Points, and that tho' they would be a&s;hamed to be the Footman of a Beggar, they are not &s;o to attend upon a Rogue, or a Blockhead; and do con&s;equently make no Scruple to &s;pread the Fame of the Iniquities and Follies of their &s;aid Ma&s;ters as far as po&s;&s;ible, and this often with great Humour and Merriment. In reality, a Footman is often a Wit, as well as a Beau, at the Expence of the Gentleman who&s;e Livery he wears.</P>
<P>After <HI>Partridge,</HI> therefore, had enlarged greatly on the va&s;t Fortune to which Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> was Heir, he very freely communicated an Apprehen&s;ion which he had begun to conceive the Day before, and for which, as we hinted at that very Time, the Behaviour of <HI>Jones</HI> &s;eemed to have furni&s;hed a &s;ufficient Foundation. In &s;hort, he was now pretty well confirmed in an Opi|nion, that his Ma&s;ter was out of his Wits, with which Opinion he very bluntly acquainted the good Company round the Fire.</P>
<P>With this Sentiment the Puppet-&s;how Man imme|diately coincided. <Q REND="inline">'I own, &s;aid he, the Gentle|man &s;urprized me very much, when he talked &s;o ab|&s;urdly about Puppet-&s;hows. It is indeed hardly to be conceived that any Man in his Sen&s;es &s;hould be &s;o much mi&s;taken; what you &s;ay now, accounts very well for all his mon&s;trous Notions. Poor Gen|tleman, I am heartily concerned for him; indeed he hath a &s;trange Wildne&s;s about his Eyes, which I took Notice of before, tho' I did not mention it.'</Q></P>
<P>The Landlord agreed with this la&s;t A&s;&s;ertion, and likewi&s;e claimed the Sagacity of having ob&s;erved it. <Q REND="inline">'And certainly, added he, it mu&s;t be &s;o: for no one but a Madman would have thought of leaving &s;o good a Hou&s;e, to ramble about the Country at that Time of Night.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="380">
The Exci&s;eman pulling his Pipe from his Mouth, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline"> 'He thought the Gentleman looked and talked a little wildly,' and then turning to <HI>Partridge,</HI> 'If he be a Madman, &s;ays he, he &s;hould not be &s;uf|fered to travel thus about the Country, for po&s;&s;ibly he may do &s;ome Mi&s;chief. It is Pity he was not &s;e|cured and &s;ent home to his Relations.'</Q></P>
<P>Now &s;ome Conceits of this Kind were likewi&s;e lurking in the Mind of <HI>Partridge:</HI> For as he was now per&s;uaded that <HI>Jones</HI> had run away from Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> he promi&s;ed him&s;elf the highe&s;t Rewards, if he could by any Means convey him back. But Fear of <HI>Jones,</HI> of who&s;e Fiercene&s;s and Strength he had &s;een, and indeed felt &s;ome In&s;tances, had however re|pre&s;ented any &s;uch Scheme as impo&s;&s;ible to be executed, and had di&s;couraged him from applying him&s;elf to form any regular Plan for the Purpo&s;e. But no &s;ooner did he hear the Sentiments of the Exci&s;eman, than he embraced that Opportunity of declaring his own, and expre&s;&s;ed a hearty Wi&s;h that &s;uch a Matter could be brought about.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Could be brought about? &s;ays the Exci&s;eman; why there is nothing ea&s;ier.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Ah! Sir, an&s;wered <HI>Partridge;</HI> you don't know what a Devil of a Fellow he is. He can take me up with one Hand, and throw me out at Window, and he would too, if he did but ima|gine&mdash;'</Q></P>
<P>'Pogh!' &s;ays the Exci&s;eman. <Q REND="inline">'I believe I am as good a Man as he.'</Q> Be&s;ides here are five of us.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'I don't know what five,' cries the Landlady, 'my Hu&s;band &s;hall have nothing to do in it. Nor &s;hall any violent Hands be laid upon any Body in my Hou&s;e. The young Gentleman is as pretty a young Gentleman as ever I &s;aw in my Life, and I believe he is no more mad than any of us. What do you tell of his having a wild Look with his Eyes? They are the prettie&s;t Eyes I ever &s;aw, and he hath the

prettie&s;t Look with them; and a very mode&s;t civil young Man he is. I am &s;ure I have bepitied him heartily ever &s;ince. The Gentleman there in the Corner told us he was cro&s;t in Love.

Who knows what may be &s;ufficient Evidence of Madne&s;s to a Jury? But I only &s;peak upon my own Account; for it don't look well for a Lawyer to be concerned in the&s;e Matters, unle&s;s it be as a Lawyer. Juries are always le&s;s favourable to us than to other Peo|ple. I don't therefore di&s;&s;uade you Mr. <HI>Thomp&s;on</HI> (to the Exci&s;eman) nor the Gentleman, nor any Body el&s;e.'</Q></P>
<P>The Exci&s;eman &s;hook his Head at this Speech, and the Puppet-&s;how-Man &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'Madne&s;s was &s;ome|times a difficult Matter for a Jury to decide: For I remember,' &s;ays he, 'I was once pre&s;ent at a Trial of Madne&s;s, where twenty Witne&s;&s;es &s;wore that the Per&s;on was as mad as a <HI>March</HI> Hare; and twenty others, that he was as much in his Sen&s;es as any Man in <HI>England.&mdash;</HI>And indeed it was the Opinion of mo&s;t People, that it was only a Trick of his Relations to rob the poor Man of his Right.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Very likely! cries the Landlady, I my&s;elf knew a poor Gentleman who was kept in a Mad-hou&s;e all his Life by his Family, and they enjoyed his E|&s;tate,

<P><Q REND="inline">'But how can he have any Right to make us Pa|pi&s;hes?' &s;ays the Landlord.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Never fear that,' cries <HI>Partridge.</HI> 'As to the Matter of Right, the Gentleman there hath proved it as clear as the Sun; and as to the Matter of Re|ligion, it is quite out of the Ca&s;e.

<P>The Attorney's Clerk had taken a great Fancy to the Sagacity of <HI>Partridge.</HI> Whether this proceeded from the great Di&s;cernment which the former had into Men, as well as Things, or whether it aro&s;e from the Sympathy between their Minds; for they were both truly <HI>Jacobites</HI> in Principle; they now &s;hook Hands heartily, and drank Bumpers of &s;trong Beer to Healths which we think proper to bury in Ob|livion.</P>
<P>The&s;e Healths were afterwards pledged by all pre|&s;ent, and even by my Landlord him&s;elf, tho' reluc|tantly; but he could not with&s;tand the Menaces of the Clerk, who &s;wore he would never &s;et his Foot within his Hou&s;e again, if he refu&s;ed.

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. <HI>In which Fortune &s;eems to have been in a better Hu|mour with</HI> Jones <HI>than we have hitherto &s;een her.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS there is no whole&s;omer, &s;o perhaps there are few &s;tronger Sleeping potions than Fatigue. Of this <HI>Jones</HI> might be &s;aid to have taken a very large Do&s;e, and it operated very forcibly upon him. He had already &s;lept nine Hours, and might perhaps have &s;lept longer, had he not been awaked by a mo&s;t vio|lent Noi&s;e at his Chamber Door, where the Sound of many heavy Blows was accompanied with as ma|ny Exclamations of Murder. <HI>Jones</HI> pre&s;ently leapt from his Bed, where he found the Ma&s;ter of the Puppet-&s;how belabouring the Back and Ribs of his poor Merry Andrew, without either Mercy or Mo|deration.</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="385">
<HI>Jones</HI> in&s;tantly interpo&s;ed on Behalf of the Suf|fering Party, and pinned the in&s;ulting Conqueror up to the Wall: For the Puppet-&s;how-Man was no more able to contend with <HI>Jones,</HI> than the poor party|coloured Je&s;ter had been to contend with this Pup|pet-man.</P>
<P>But tho' the Merry Andrew was a little Fellow, and not very &s;trong, he had neverthele&s;s &s;ome Choler about him. He therefore no &s;ooner found him&s;elf delivered from the Enemy, than he began to attack him with the only weapon at which he was his E|qual. From this he fir&s;t di&s;charged a Volley of ge|neral abu&s;ive Words, and thence proceeded to &s;ome particular Accu&s;ations&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'D&mdash;n your Bl&mdash;d, you Ra&s;cal, &s;ays he, I have not only &s;upported you, for you owe all the Money you get to me; but I have &s;aved you from the Gallows. Did you not want to rob the Lady of her fine Riding-Habit, no longer ago than Ye&s;terday, in the Back-lane here? Can you deny that you wi&s;hed to have had her alone in a Wood to &s;trip her, to &s;trip one of the pret|tie&s;t Ladies that ever was &s;een in the World? and here you have fallen upon me, and have almo&s;t mur|dered me for doing no Harm to a Girl as willing as my&s;elf, only becau&s;e &s;he likes me better than you.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> no &s;ooner heard this, than he quitted the Ma&s;ter, laying at the &s;ame time the mo&s;t violent In|junctions of Forbearance from any further In&s;ult on the Merry Andrew, and then taking the poor Wretch with him into his own Apartment, he &s;oon learnt tid|ings of his <HI>Sophia,</HI> whom the Fellow as he was attend|ing his Ma&s;ter with his Drum the Day before, had &s;een pa&s;s by. He ea&s;ily prevailed with the Lad to &s;hew him the exact Place, and then having &s;ummoned <HI>Partridge,</HI> he departed with the utmo&s;t Expedition.</P>
<P>It was almo&s;t eight of the Clock before all Matters could be got ready for his Departure: For <HI>Partridge</HI>
<PB N="377" REF="386">
was not in any Ha&s;te; nor could the Reckoning be pre&s;ently adju&s;ted; and when both the&s;e were &s;ettled and over, <HI>Jones</HI> would not quit the Place before he had perfectly reconciled all Differences between Ma&s;|ter and Man.</P>
<P>When this was happily accompli&s;hed, he &s;et for|wards, and was by the tru&s;ty Merry Andrew conduct|ed to the Spot where <HI>Sophia</HI> had pa&s;t; and then having hand&s;omely rewarded his Conductor, he again pu&s;h|ed on with the utmo&s;t eagerne&s;s, being highly de|lighted with the extraordinary Manner in which he received his Intelligence. Of this <HI>Partridge</HI> was no &s;ooner acquainted, than he, with great Earne&s;tne&s;s, began to prophe&s;y, and a&s;&s;ured <HI>Jones,</HI> that he would certainly have good Succe&s;s in the End: For, he &s;aid, 'two &s;uch Accidents could never have happen|ed 'to direct him after his Mi&s;tre&s;s, if Providence 'had not de&s;igned to bring them together at la&s;t.' And this was the fir&s;t Time that <HI>Jones</HI> lent Attention to the Super&s;titious Doctrines of his Companion.</P>
<P>They had not gone above two Miles, when a vio|lent Storm of Rain overtook them, and as they happened to be at the &s;ame Time in Sight of an Alehou&s;e, <HI>Partridge,</HI> with much earne&s;t Entrea|ty, prevailed with <HI>Jones</HI> to enter, and Weather the Storm.</P>
<P>Hunger is an Enemy (if indeed it may be called one) which partakes more of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> than of the <HI>French</HI> Di&s;po&s;ition; for tho' you &s;ubdue this never &s;o often, it will always rally again in Time; and &s;o it did with <HI>Partridge,</HI> who was no &s;ooner arrived within the Kitchen, than he began to a&s;k the &s;ame Que&s;tions which he had a&s;ked the Night before. The Con&s;e|quence of this was an excellent cold Chine being pro|duced upon the Table, upon which not only <HI>Par|tridge,</HI> but <HI>Jones</HI> him&s;elf, made a very hearty Break|fa&s;t, tho' the latter began to grow again unea&s;y, as
<PB N="378" REF="387">
the People of the Hou&s;e could give him no fre&s;h In|formation concerning <HI>Sophia.</HI></P>
<P>Their Meal being over, <HI>Jones</HI> was again preparing to &s;ally, notwith&s;tanding the Violence of the Storm &s;till continued; but <HI>Partridge</HI> begged heartily for ano|ther Mugg, and at length ca&s;ting his Eyes on a Lad at the Fire, who had entered into the Kitchen, and who at that In&s;tant was looking as earne&s;tly at him, he turned &s;uddenly to <HI>Jones,</HI> and cried, <Q REND="inline">'Ma&s;ter, give me your Hand, a &s;ingle Mugg &s;han't &s;erve the Turn this Bout. Why here's more News of Madam <HI>Sophia</HI> come to Town. The Boy there &s;tanding by the Fire is the very Lad that rid before her. I can &s;wear to my own Plai&s;ter on his Face. Hea|vens ble&s;s you, Sir, cries the Boy, it is your own Plai&s;ter &s;ure enough; I &s;hall have always Rea&s;on to remember your Goodne&s;s; for it hath almo&s;t cured me.'</Q></P>
<P>At the&s;e Words <HI>Jones</HI> &s;tarted from his Chair, and bidding the Boy follow him immediately, departed from the Kitchen into a private Apartment; for &s;o delicate was he with regard to <HI>Sophia,</HI> that he never willingly mentioned her Name in the Pre&s;ence of ma|ny People; and tho' he had, as it were, from the Overflowings of his Heart, given <HI>Sophia</HI> as a Toa&s;t among the Officers, where he thought it was im|po&s;&s;ible &s;he &s;hould be known; yet even there the Rea|der may remember how difficultly he was prevailed upon to mention her Sir-name.</P>
<P>Hard therefore was it, and perhaps in the Opinion of many &s;agacious Readers, very ab&s;urd and mon|&s;trous, that he &s;hould principally owe his pre&s;ent Mis|fortune to the &s;uppo&s;ed Want of that Delicacy with which he &s;o abounded; for in reality <HI>Sophia</HI> was much more offended at the Freedoms which &s;he thought, and not without good Rea&s;on, he had taken with her Name and Character, than any Freedoms, in which, under his pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, he had
<PB N="379" REF="388">
indulged him&s;elf with the Per&s;on of another Woman; and to &s;ay Truth, I believe <HI>Honour</HI> would never have prevailed on her to leave <HI>Upton</HI> without &s;eeing her <HI>Jones,</HI> had it not been for tho&s;e two &s;trong In&s;tances of a Levity in his Behaviour, &s;o void of all Re&s;pect, and indeed &s;o highly incon&s;i&s;tent with any Degree of Love and Tenderne&s;s in great and delicate Minds.</P>
<P>But &s;o Matters fell out, and &s;o I mu&s;t relate them; and if any Reader is &s;hocked at their appearing un|natural, I cannot help it. I mu&s;t remind &s;uch Per|&s;ons, that I am not writing a Sy&s;tem, but a Hi&s;tory, and I am not obliged to reconcile every Matter to the received Notions concerning Truth and Nature. But if this was never &s;o ea&s;y to do, perhaps it might be more prudent in me to avoid it. For In&s;tance, as the Fact at pre&s;ent before us now &s;tands, without any Comment of mine upon it, tho' it may at fir&s;t Sight offend &s;ome Readers, yet upon more mature Con&s;i|deration, it mu&s;t plea&s;e all; for wi&s;e and good Men may con&s;ider what happened to <HI>Jones</HI> at <HI>Upton</HI> as a ju&s;t Puni&s;hment for his Wickedne&s;s, with Regard to Women, of which it was indeed the immediate Con&s;equence; and &s;illy and bad per&s;ons may comfort them&s;elves in their Vices, by flattering their own Hearts that the Characters of Men are rather owing to Accident than to Virtue. Now perhaps the Re|flections which we &s;hould be here inclined to draw, would alike contradict both the&s;e Conclu&s;ions, and would &s;hew that the&s;e Incidents contribute only to confirm the great, u&s;eful and uncommon Doctrine, which it is the Purpo&s;e of this whole Work to incul|cate, and which we mu&s;t not fill up our Pages by frequently repeating, as an ordinary Par&s;on fills his Sermon by repeating his Text at the End of every Paragraph.</P>
<P>We are contented that it mu&s;t appear, however unhappily <HI>Sophia</HI> had erred in her Opinion of <HI>Jones,</HI>
<PB N="380" REF="389">
&s;he had &s;ufficient Rea&s;on for her Opinion; &s;ince, I believe, every other young-Lady would, in her Si|tuation, have erred in the &s;ame Manner. Nay, had &s;he followed her Lover at this very Time, and had entered this very Alehou&s;e the Moment he was de|parted from it, &s;he would have found the Landlord as well acquainted with her Name and Per&s;on as the Wench at <HI>Upton</HI> had appeared to be. For while <HI>Jones</HI> was examining his Boy in Whi&s;pers in an inner Room, <HI>Partridge,</HI> who had no &s;uch Delicacy in his Di&s;po&s;ition, was in the Kitchen very openly cate|chi&s;ing the other Guide who attended Mrs. <HI>Fitzpa|trick;</HI> by which Means the Landlord, who&s;e Ears were open enough on all &s;uch Occa&s;ions, became perfectly well acquainted with the Tumble of <HI>Sophia</HI> from her Hor&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with the Mi&s;take concerning <HI>Jenny Cameron,</HI> with the many Con&s;equences of the Punch, and, in &s;hort, with almo&s;t every thing which had happened at the Inn, whence we di&s;patched our Ladies in a Coach and Six, when we la&s;t took our Leaves of them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IX. <HI>Containing little more than a few odd Ob&s;ervations.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>JONES</HI> had been ab&s;ent a full half Hour, when he returned into the Kitchen in a Hurry, de&s;iring the Landlord to let him know that In&s;tant what was to pay. And now the Concern which <HI>Partridge</HI> felt at being obliged to quit a warm Chimney-corner, and a Cup of excellent Liquor, was &s;omewhat compen&s;ated by hear|ing he was to proceed no farther on Foot; for <HI>Jones,</HI> by Golden Arguments, had prevailed with the Boy to attend him back to the Inn whither he had before conducted <HI>Sophia;</HI> but to this however the Lad con|&s;ented, upon Condition that the other Guide would wait for him at the Alehou&s;e; becau&s;e, as the Land|lord at <HI>Upton</HI> was an intimate Acquaintance of the
<PB N="381" REF="390">
Landlord at <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> it might &s;ome Time or other come to the Ears of the latter, that his Hor&s;es had been let to more than one Per&s;on, and &s;o the Boy might be brought to Account for Money which he wi&s;ely intended to put in his own Pocket.</P>
<P>We were obliged to mention this Circum&s;tance, trifling as it may &s;eem, &s;ince it retarded Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> a con&s;iderable Time in his &s;etting out; for the hone&s;ty of this latter Boy was &s;omewhat high&mdash;that is, &s;ome|what high-priced, and would indeed have co&s;t <HI>Jones</HI> very dear, had not <HI>Partridge,</HI> who, as we have &s;aid, was a very cunning Fellow, artfully thrown in half a Crown to be &s;pent at that very Alehou&s;e, while the Boy was waiting for his Companion. This half Crown the Landlord no &s;ooner got Scent of, than he opened after it with &s;uch vehement and per&s;ua&s;ive Out|cry, that the Boy was &s;oon overcome, and con&s;ented to take half a Crown more for his Stay. Here we cannot help ob&s;erving, that as there is &s;o much of Po|licy in the lowe&s;t Life, great Men often overvalue them&s;elves on tho&s;e Refinements in Impo&s;ture, in which they are frequently excelled by &s;ome of the lowe&s;t of the Human Species.</P>
<P>The Hor&s;es being now produced, <HI>Jones</HI> directly leapt into the Side-Saddle, on which his dear <HI>Sophia</HI> had rid. The Lad indeed very civilly offered him, the U&s;e of his; but he cho&s;e the Side-Saddle, pro|bably becau&s;e it was &s;ofter. <HI>Partridge,</HI> however, tho' full as effeminate as <HI>Jones,</HI> could not bear the Thoughts of degrading his Manhood, he therefore accepted the Boy's offer; and now <HI>Jones,</HI> being mounted on the Side-Saddle of his <HI>Sophia,</HI> the Boy on that of Mrs. <HI>Honour,</HI> and <HI>Partridge</HI> be&s;triding the third Hor&s;e, they &s;et forwards on their Jour|ney, and within four Hours arrived at the Inn where the Reader hath already &s;pent &s;o much Time. <HI>Par|tridge</HI> was in very high Spirits during the whole
<PB N="382" REF="391">
Way, and often mentioned to <HI>Jones</HI> the many good Omens of his future Succe&s;s, which had lately be|friended him; and which the Reader, without being the lea&s;t &s;uper&s;titious, mu&s;t allow to have been pecu|liarly fortunate. <HI>Partridge</HI> was moreover better plea&s;ed with the pre&s;ent Pur&s;uit of his Companion, than he had been with his Pur&s;uit of Glory; and from the&s;e very Omens, which a&s;&s;ured the Pedagogue of Succe&s;s, he likewi&s;e fir&s;t acquired a clear Idea of the Amour between <HI>Jones</HI> and <HI>Sophia;</HI> to which he had before given very little Attention, as he had ori|ginally taken a wrong Scent concerning the Rea&s;ons of <HI>Jones</HI>'s Departure; and as to what happened at <HI>Upton,</HI> he was too much frightened ju&s;t before and after his leaving that Place, to draw any other Conclu&s;ions from thence, than that <HI>Jones</HI> was a downright Madman: A conceit which was not at all di&s;agreeable to the Opinion he before had of his ex|traordinary Wildne&s;s, of which, he thought, his Be|haviour on their quitting <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> &s;o well ju&s;tified all the Accounts he had formerly received. He was how however pretty well &s;atisfied with his pre&s;ent Expedition, and henceforth began to conceive much worthier Sentiments of his Friend's Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>The Clock had ju&s;t &s;truck Three when they arriv|ed, and <HI>Jones</HI> immediately be&s;poke Po&s;t Hor&s;es; but unluckily there was not a Hor&s;e to be procured in the whole Place; which the Reader will not wonder at, when he con&s;iders the Hurry in which the whole Nation, and e&s;pecially this Part of it, was at this time engaged, when Expre&s;&s;es were pa&s;&s;ing and re|pa&s;&s;ing every Hour of the Day and Night.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> endeavoured all he could to prevail with his former Guide to e&s;corte him to <HI>Coventry;</HI> but he was inexorable. While he was arguing with the Boy in the Inn-yard, a Per&s;on came up to him, and &s;aluting him by his Name, enquired how all the good Family did in <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire;</HI> and now <HI>Jones</HI> ca&s;ting his Eyes
<PB N="383" REF="392">
upon this Per&s;on, pre&s;ently di&s;covered him to be Mr. <HI>Dowling</HI> the Lawyer, with whom he had dined at <HI>Glou|ce&s;ter,</HI> and with much Courte&s;y returned his Salutation.</P>
<P><HI>Dowling</HI> very earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> to go no further that Night; and backed his Solicitations with many unan&s;werable Arguments, &s;uch as, that it was almo&s;t dark, that the Roads were very dirty, and that he would be able to travel much better by Day-light, with many others equally good, &s;ome of which <HI>Jones</HI> had probably &s;ugge&s;ted to him&s;elf before; but as they were then ineffectual, &s;o they were &s;till, and he con|tinued re&s;olute in his De&s;ign, even tho' he &s;hould be obliged to &s;et out on Foot.</P>
<P>When the good Attorney found he could not pre|vail on <HI>Jones</HI> to &s;tay, he as &s;trenuou&s;ly applied him&s;elf to per&s;uade the Guide to accompany him. He urg|ed many Motives to induce him to undertake this &s;hort Journey, and at la&s;t concluded with &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">'Do you think the Gentleman won't very well reward you for your Trouble?'</Q></P>
<P>Two to one are odds at every other thing, as well as at Foot-ball. But the Advantage which this united Force hath in Per&s;ua&s;ion or Entreaty, mu&s;t have been vi&s;ible to a curious Ob&s;erver; for he mu&s;t have often &s;een, that when a Father, a Ma&s;ter, a Wife, or any other Per&s;on in Authority, have &s;toutly adhered to a Denial again&s;t all the Rea&s;ons which a &s;ingle Man could produce, they have afterwards yielded to the Repeti|tion of the &s;ame Sentiments by a &s;econd or third Per|&s;on, who hath undertaken the Cau&s;e without attempt|ing to advance any thing new in its Behalf. And hence perhaps proceeds the Phra&s;e of &s;econding an Argument or a Motion, and the great Con&s;equence of which this is in all A&s;&s;emblies of public Debate. Hence likewi&s;e probably it is, that in our Courts of Law we often hear a learned Gentleman (generally a Serjeant) repeating for an Hour together what another learned Gentleman who &s;poke before him had ju&s;t been &s;aying.</P>
<P><PB N="384" REF="393">
In&s;tead of accounting for this, we &s;hall proceed in our u&s;ual Manner to exemplify it in the Conduct of the Lad above-mentioned, who &s;ubmitted to the Per|&s;ua&s;ions of Mr. <HI>Dowling,</HI> and promi&s;ed once more to admit <HI>Jones</HI> into his Side-Saddle; but in&s;i&s;ted on fir&s;t giving the poor Creatures a good Bait, &s;aying, they had travelled a great Ways, and been rid very hard. Indeed this Caution of the Boy was needle&s;s; for <HI>Jones,</HI> notwith&s;tanding his Hurry and Impatience, would have ordered this of him&s;elf; for he by no Means agreed with the Opinions of tho&s;e who con&s;i|der Animals as mere Machines, and when they bury their Spurs in the Belly of their Hor&s;e, imagine the Spur and the Hor&s;e to have an equal Capacity of feel|ing Pain.</P>
<P>While the Bea&s;ts were eating their Corn, or rather were &s;uppo&s;ed to eat it; (for as the Boy was taking Care of him&s;elf in the Kitchen, the O&s;tler took great Care that his Corn &s;hould not be con&s;umed in the Stable) Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> at the earne&s;t De&s;ire of Mr. <HI>Dowl|ing,</HI> accompanied that Gentleman into his Room, where they &s;at down together over a Bottle of Wine.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Dowling</HI> was indeed very greatly affected with this Relation; for he had not dive&s;ted him&s;elf of Hu|manity by being an Attorney. Indeed nothing is more unju&s;t than to carry our Prejudices again&s;t a Pro|fe&s;&s;ion into private Life, and to borrow our Idea of a Man from our Opinion of his Calling. Habit, it is true, le&s;&s;ens the Horror of tho&s;e Actions which the Profe&s;&s;ion makes nece&s;&s;ary, and con&s;equently habitual; but in all other In&s;tances, Nature works in Men of all Profe&s;&s;ions alike; nay, perhaps, even more &s;trongly with tho&s;e who give her, as it were, a Holiday, when they are following their ordinary Bu&s;ine&s;s. A Butcher, I make no doubt, would feel Compunction at the Slaughter of a fine Hor&s;e; and though a Surgeon can conceive no Pain in cutting off a Limb, I have known him compa&s;&s;ionate a Man in a Fit of the Gout. The common Hangman, who hath &s;tretched the Neck of Hundreds, is known to have trembled at his fir&s;t O|peration on a Head: And the very Profe&s;&s;ors of Hu|man Blood, who in their Trade of War butcher Thou&s;ands, not only of their Fellow Profe&s;&s;ors, but often of Women and Children, without Remor&s;e; even the&s;e, I &s;ay, in Times of Peace when Drums and Trumpets are laid a&s;ide, often lay a&s;ide all their Ferocity, and become very gentle Members of civil Society. In the &s;ame Manner an Attorney may feel all the Mi&s;eries and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his Fellow Creatures, provided he happens not to be concerned again&s;t them.</P>
<P><HI>Jones,</HI> as the Reader knows, was yet unacquainted with the very black Colours in which he had been re|pre&s;ented to Mr. <HI>Allworthy;</HI> and as to other Matters he did not &s;hew them in the mo&s;t di&s;advantageous Light: For though he was unwilling to ca&s;t any Blame on his former Friend and Patron, yet he was not very de&s;irous of heaping too much upon him&s;elf. <HI>Dowling</HI> therefore ob&s;erved, and not without Rea&s;on, that very
<PB N="388" REF="397">
ill Offices mu&s;t have been done him by &s;ome Body: <Q REND="inline">'For certainly, cries he, the Squire would never have di&s;inherited you only for a few Faults, which any young Gentleman might have committed. In|deed I cannot properly &s;ay di&s;inherited; for to be &s;ure by Law you cannot claim as Heir. That's certain; that no Body need go to Council for. Yet when a Gentleman had in a Manner adopted you thus as his own Son, you might rea&s;onably have expected &s;ome con&s;iderable Part, if not the Whole; nay, if you had expected the Whole, I &s;hould not have blamed you: For certainly every one is for getting as much as they can, and they are not to be blamed on that Account.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Indeed you wrong me, &s;aid <HI>Jones;</HI> 'I &s;hould have been contented with very little: I never had any View upon Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI>'s Fortune; nay, I be|lieve, I may truly &s;ay, I never once con&s;idered what he could or might give me. This I &s;olemnly de|clare, if he had done a Prejudice to his Nephew in my Favour, I would have undone it again. I had rather enjoy my own Mind than the Fortune of an|other Man. What is the poor Pride ari&s;ing from a magnificent Hou&s;e, a numerous Equipage, a &s;plendid Table, and from all the other Advantages or Ap|pearances of Fortune, compared to the warm, &s;olid Content, the &s;welling Satisfaction, the thrilling Tran&s;ports, and the exulting Triumphs, which a good Mind enjoys, in the Contemplation of a gene|rous, virtuous, noble, benevolent Action?

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. <HI>The Di&s;a&s;ters which befel</HI> Jones <HI>on his Departure for</HI> Coventry; <HI>with the &s;age Remarks of</HI> Partridge.</HEAD>
<P>NO Road can be plainer than that from the Place they now were to <HI>Coventry;</HI> and though nei|ther <HI>Jones</HI> nor <HI>Partridge,</HI> nor the Guide, had ever tra|velled it before, it would have been almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to have mi&s;&s;ed their Way, had it not been for the two Rea&s;ons mentioned in the Conclu&s;ion of the la&s;t Chapter.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Circum&s;tences, however, happening both unfortunately to intervene, our Travellers de|viated into a much le&s;s frequented Track; and after riding full Six miles, in&s;tead of arriving at the &s;tately Spires of <HI>Coventry,</HI> they found them&s;elves &s;till in a very dirty Lane, where they &s;aw no Symptoms of approaching the Suburbs of a large City.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> now declared that they mu&s;t certainly have lo&s;t their Way; but this the Guide in&s;i&s;ted upon was impo&s;&s;ible; a Word which, in common Conver&s;a|tion, is often u&s;ed not only to &s;ignify improbable, but often what is really very likely, and, &s;ometimes, what hath certainly happened: An hyperbolical Vio|lence
<PB N="391" REF="400">
like that which is &s;o frequently offered to the Words Infinite and Eternal; by the former of which it is u&s;ual to expre&s;s a Di&s;tance of half a Yard; and by the latter, a Duration of five Minutes. And thus it is as u&s;ual to a&s;&s;ert the impo&s;&s;ibility of lo&s;ing what is already actually lo&s;t. This was, in fact, the Ca&s;e at pre&s;ent: For notwith&s;tanding all the confident A&s;|&s;ertions of the Lad to the contrary, it is certain they were no more in the right Road to <HI>Coventry,</HI> than the fradulent, griping, cruel, canting Mi&s;er is in the right Road to Heaven.</P>
<P>It is not, perhaps, ea&s;y for a Reader who hath ne|ver been in tho&s;e Circum&s;tances, to imagine the Hor|ror with which Darkne&s;s, Rain, and Wind fill Per|&s;ons who have lo&s;t their Way in the Night; and who, con&s;equently, have not the plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect of warm Fires, dry Cloaths, and other Refre&s;hments, to &s;up|port their Minds in &s;truggling with the Inclemencies of the Weather. A very imperfect Idea of this Hor|ror will, however, &s;erve &s;ufficiently to account for the Conceits which now filled the Head of <HI>Partridge,</HI> and which we &s;hall pre&s;ently be obliged to open.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> grew more and more po&s;itive that they were out of their Road; and the Boy him&s;elf, at la&s;t, ac|knowledged he believed they were not in the right Road to <HI>Coventry;</HI> tho' he affirmed, at the &s;ame Time, it was impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould have mi&s;t the Way. But <HI>Par|tridge</HI> was of a different Opinion. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'When they fir&s;t &s;et out he imagined &s;ome Mi&s;chief or o|ther would happen.&mdash;Did not you ob&s;erve, Sir,' &s;aid he to <HI>Jones,</HI> that old Woman who &s;tood at the Door ju&s;t as you was taking Hor&s;e? I wi&s;h you had given her a &s;mall Matter, with all my Heart; for &s;he &s;aid then you might repent it, and at that very In&s;tant it began to rain, and the Wind hath conti|nued ri&s;ing ever &s;ince. Whatever &s;ome People may think, I am very certain it is in the Power of Witches to rai&s;e the Wind whenever they

plea&s;e. I have &s;een it happen very often in my Time: And if ever I &s;aw a Witch in all my Life, that old Woman was certainly one. I thought &s;o to my&s;elf at that very Time; and if I had had any Halfpence in my Pocket, I would have given her &s;ome: For to be &s;ure it is always good to be cha|ritable to tho&s;e Sort of People, for Fear what may happen; and many a Per&s;on hath lo&s;t his Cattle by &s;aving a Halfpenny.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> tho' he was horridly vexed at the Delay which this Mi&s;take was likely to occa&s;ion in his Journey, could not help &s;miling at the Super&s;tition of his Friend, whom an Accident now greatly confirmed in his O|pinion. This was a Tumble from his Hor&s;e; by which, however, he received no other Injury than what the Dirt conferred on his Cloaths.</P>
<P><HI>Partridge</HI> had no &s;ooner recovered his Legs, than he appealed to his Fall, as conclu&s;ive Evidence of all he had a&s;&s;erted: But <HI>Jones,</HI> finding he was unhurt, an&s;wered with a Smile: <Q REND="inline">'This Witch of yours, <HI>Partridge,</HI> is a mo&s;t ungrateful Jade, and doth not, I find, di&s;tingui&s;h her Friends from others in her Re&s;entment. If the old Lady had been angry with me for neglecting her, I don't &s;ee why &s;he &s;hould tumble you from your Hor&s;e, after all the Re&s;pect you have expre&s;&s;ed for her.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'It is ill je&s;ting, cries <HI>Partridge,</HI> with People who have Power to do the&s;e Things; for they are often very malicious. I remember a Farrier, who provoked one of them, by a&s;king her when the Time &s;he had bargained with the Devil for would be out; and within three Months from that very Day one of his be&s;t Cows was drowned. Nor was &s;he &s;atisfied with that; for a little Time after|wards he lo&s;t a Barrel of Be&s;t-Drink: For the old Witch pulled out the Spicket, and let it run all over the Cellar, the very fir&s;t Evening he had tapped it, to make merry with &s;ome of his Neighbours. In
<PB N="393" REF="402">
&s;hort, nothing ever thrived with him afterwards; for &s;he worried the poor Man &s;o, that he took to Drinking; and in a Year or two his Stock was &s;eiz|ed, and he and his Family are now come to the Pari&s;h.'</Q></P>
<P>The Guide, and perhaps his Hor&s;e too, were both &s;o attentive to this Di&s;cour&s;e, that, either thro' Want of Care, or by the Malice of the Witch, they were now both &s;prawling in the Dirt.</P>
<P><HI>Partridge</HI> entirely imputed this Fall, as he had done his own, to the &s;ame Cau&s;e. He told Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> <Q REND="inline">'it would certainly be his Turn next,' and earne&s;tly intreated him 'to return back, and find out the old Woman, and pacify her. We &s;hall very &s;oon, added he, reach the Inn: For tho' we have &s;eemed to go forward, I am very certain we are in the identical Place in which we were an Hour ago; and I dare &s;wear if it was Day-light, we might now &s;ee the Inn we &s;et out from.'</Q></P>
<P>In&s;tead of returning any An&s;wer to this &s;age Ad|vice, <HI>Jones</HI> was entirely attentive to what had happen|ed to the Boy, who received no other Hurt than what had before befallen <HI>Pattridge,</HI> and which his Cloaths very ea&s;ily bore, as they had been for many Years inured to the like. He &s;oon regained his Side-Saddle, and, by the hearty Cur&s;es and Blows which he be&s;tow|ed on his Hor&s;e, quickly &s;atisfied Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> that no Harm was done.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. <HI>Relates that Mr.</HI> Jones <HI>continued his Journey contrary to the Advice of</HI> Partridge, <HI>with what happened on that Occa&s;ion.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THEY now di&s;covered a Light at &s;ome Di&s;tance, to the great Plea&s;ure of <HI>Jones,</HI> and to the no &s;mall Terror of <HI>Partridge,</HI> who firmly believed him|&s;elf
<PB N="394" REF="403">
to be bewitched, and that this Light was a <HI>Jack</HI> with a Lanthorn, or &s;omewhat more mi&s;chievous.</P>
<P>But how were the&s;e Fears increa&s;ed, when, as they approached nearer to this Light, (or Lights as they now appeared) they heard a confu&s;ed Sound of Hu|man Voices; of &s;inging, laughing, and hallowing, together with a &s;trange Noi&s;e that &s;eemed to proceed from &s;ome In&s;truments; but could hardly be allowed the Name of Mu&s;ic. Indeed, to favour a little the Opinion of <HI>Partridge,</HI> it might very well be called Mu&s;ic bewitched.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive a much greater Degree of Horror than what now &s;eized on <HI>Partridge;</HI> the Contagion of which had reached the Po&s;t-boy; who had been very attentive to many Things that the other had uttered. He now therefore joined in petitioning <HI>Jones</HI> to return; &s;aying he firmly believed what <HI>Par|tridge</HI> had ju&s;t before &s;aid, that tho' the Hor&s;es &s;eemed to go on, they had not moved a Step forwards dur|ing at lea&s;t the la&s;t half Hour.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> could not help &s;miling in the mid&s;t of his Vex|ation, at the Fears of the&s;e poor Fellows. <Q REND="inline">'Either we advance, &s;ays he, towards the Lights, or the Lights have advanced towards us; for we are now at a very little Di&s;tance from them; but how can either of you be afraid of a Set of People who appear only to be merry-making?'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Merry-making, Sir!' cries <HI>Partridge,</HI> 'who could be merry-making at this Time of Night, and in &s;uch a Place, and &s;uch weather? They can be no|thing but Gho&s;ts or Witches, or &s;ome Evil Spirits or other, that's certain.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Let them be what they will,' cries <HI>Jones,</HI> 'I am re&s;olved to go up to them, and enquire the Way to <HI>Coventry.</HI> All Witches, <HI>Partridge,</HI> are not &s;uch ill-natured Hags, as that we had the Misfortune to meet with la&s;t.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><PB N="395" REF="404">
'Oh Lord, Sir! cries <HI>Partridge,</HI> there is no knowing what Humour they will be in; to be &s;ure it is always be&s;t to be civil to them; but what if we &s;hould meet with &s;omething wor&s;e than Witches, with Evil Spirits them&s;elves&mdash;Pray, Sir, be ad|vi&s;ed; pray, Sir, do. If you had read &s;o many ter|rible Accounts as I have of the&s;e Matters, you would not be &s;o Fool-hardy&mdash;The Lord knows whither we have got already, or whither we are going: For &s;ure &s;uch Darkne&s;s was never &s;een upon Earth, and I que&s;tion whether it can be darker in the other World.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> put forwards as fa&s;t as he could, notwith|&s;tanding all the&s;e Hints and Cautions, and poor <HI>Par|tridge</HI> was obliged to follow: For tho' he hardly dared advance, he dared &s;till le&s;s to &s;tay behind by him&s;elf.</P>
<P>At length they arrived at the Place whence the Lights and different Noi&s;es had i&s;&s;ued. This <HI>Jones</HI> perceived to be no other than a Barn where a great Number of Men and Women were a&s;&s;embled, and were diverting them&s;elves with much apparent Jol|lity.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> no &s;ooner appeared before the great Doors of the Barn, which were open, than a ma&s;culine and very rough Voice from within demanded who was there?&mdash;To which <HI>Jones</HI> gently an&s;wered, a Friend; and immediately a&s;ked the Road to <HI>Co|ventry.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'If you are a Friend, cries another of the Men in the Barn, you had better alight till the Storm is over, (for indeed it was now more violent than ever) you are very welcome to put up your Hor&s;e, for there is &s;ufficient Room for him at one End of the Barn.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'You are very obliging,' returned <HI>Jones;</HI> 'and I will accept your Offer for a few Minutes, whil&s;t the Rain continues; and here are two more who will be glad of the &s;ame Favour.'</Q> This was ac|corded

with more Good-will than it was accepted: For <HI>Partridge</HI> would rather have &s;ubmitted to the ut|mo&s;t Inclemency of the Weather, than have tru&s;ted to the Clemency of tho&s;e whom he took for Hob|goblins; and the poor Po&s;t-boy was now infected with the &s;ame Apprehen&s;ions; but they were both oblig|ed to follow the Example of <HI>Jones;</HI> the one be|cau&s;e he dur&s;t not leave his Hor&s;e, and the other becau&s;e he feared nothing &s;o much as being left by him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Had this Hi&s;tory been writ in the Days of Super|&s;tition, I &s;hould have had too much Compa&s;&s;ion for the Reader to have left him &s;o long in Su&s;pence, whe|ther <HI>Beelzebub</HI> or <HI>Satan</HI> was about actually to ap|pear in Per&s;on, with all his Helli&s;h Retinue; but as the&s;e Doctrines are at pre&s;ent very unfortu|nate, and have but few if any Believers, I have not been much aware of conveying any &s;uch Ter|rors. To &s;ay Truth, the whole Furniture of the infernal Regions hath long been appropriated by the Managers of Playhou&s;es, who &s;eem lately to have lain them by as Rubbi&s;h, capable only of affecting the Upper Gallery; a Place in which few of our Readers ever &s;it.</P>
<P>However, tho' we do not &s;u&s;pect rai&s;ing any great Terror on this Occa&s;ion, we have Rea&s;on to fear &s;ome other Apprehen&s;ions may ari&s;e in our Reader, into which we would not willingly betray him, I mean that we are going to take a Voyage into Fairy Land, and to introduce a Set of Beings into our Hi&s;|tory, which &s;carce any one was ever childi&s;h enough to believe, tho' many have been fooli&s;h enough to &s;pend their Time in writing and reading their Ad|ventures.</P>
<P>To prevent therefore any &s;uch Su&s;picions, &s;o pre|judicial to the Credit of an Hi&s;torian, who profe&s;&s;es to draw his Materials from Nature only, we &s;hall now proceed to acquaint the Reader who the&s;e People were, who&s;e &s;udden Appearance had &s;truck &s;uch Ter|rors

into <HI>Partridge,</HI> had more than half frightened the Po&s;t-Boy, and had a little &s;urprized even Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The People then a&s;&s;embled in this Barn were no other than a Company of <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> or as they are vulgarly called <HI>Gyp&s;ies,</HI> and they were now celebrating the Wedding of one of their Society.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive a happier Set of People than appeared here to be met together.

<P>Greater Plenty likewi&s;e was no where to be &s;een, than what flouri&s;hed in this Barn. Here was indeed no Nicety nor Elegance, nor did the keen Appetite of the Gue&s;ts require any. Here was good Store of Bacon, Fowls, and Mutton, to which every one pre&s;ent pro|vided better Sauce him&s;elf, than the be&s;t and deare&s;t <HI>French</HI> Cook can prepare.</P>

<P>than was our Heroe at what he &s;aw in this Barn. While he was looking every where round him with A&s;toni&s;hment, a venerable Per&s;on approached him with many friendly Salutations, rather of too hearty a Kind to be called courtly. This was no other than the King of the <HI>Gyp&s;ies</HI> him&s;elf. He was very little di&s;tingni&s;hed in Dre&s;s from his Subjects, nor had he any <HI>Regalia</HI> of Maje&s;ty to &s;upport his Dignity; and yet there &s;eemed (as Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> &s;aid) to be &s;omewhat in his Air which denoted Authority, and in&s;pired the Beholders with an Idea of Awe and Re&s;pect; tho'
<PB N="398" REF="407">
all this was perhaps imaginary in <HI>Jones,</HI> and the Truth may be, that &s;uch Ideas are incident to Power, and almo&s;t in&s;eparable from it.</P>
<P>There was &s;omewhat in the open Countenance and courteous Behaviour of <HI>Jones,</HI> which being acom|panied with much Comeline&s;s of Per&s;on, greatly re|commended him at fir&s;t Sight to every Beholder. The&s;e were perhaps a little heightened in the pre&s;ent In&s;tance, by that profound Re&s;pect which he paid to the King of the <HI>Gyp&s;ies,</HI> the Moment he was ac|quainted with his Dignity, and which was the &s;weeter to his <HI>Gyp&s;eian</HI> Maje&s;ty, as he was not u&s;ed to receive &s;uch Homage from any but his own Subjects.</P>
<P>The King ordered a Table to be &s;pread with the choice&s;t of their Provi&s;ions for his Accommodation, and having placed him&s;elf at his Right Hand, his Maje&s;ty began to di&s;cour&s;e our Heroe in the following Mannner:</P>

<P>The King then proceeded to expre&s;s &s;ome Won|der that there was no &s;uch Puni&s;hment as Shame in other Governments. Upon which <HI>Jones</HI> a&s;&s;ured him to the contrary: For there were many Crimes for which Shame was inflicted by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Laws, and that it was indeed one Con&s;equence of all Puni&s;h|ment. <Q REND="inline">'Dat be ver &s;trange, &s;aid the King: For me know and hears good deal of your People, dough me no live among dem, and me ave often hear dat Sham is de Con&s;equence and de Cau&s;e too of many your Rewards.

<P>While his Maje&s;ty was thus di&s;cour&s;ing with <HI>Jones,</HI> a &s;udden Uproar aro&s;e in the Barn, and as it &s;eems, upon this Occa&s;ion: The Curte&s;y of the&s;e People by Degrees had removed all Apprehen&s;ions of <HI>Par|tridge,</HI> and he was prevailed upon not only to &s;tuff him&s;elf with their Food, but to ta&s;te &s;ome of their Liquors, which by Degrees entirely expelled all Fear from his Compo&s;ition, and in its Stead introduced much more agreeable Sen&s;ations.</P>
<P><PB N="400" REF="409">
A young Female <HI>Gyp&s;y,</HI> more remarkable for her Wit than her Beauty, had decoyed the hone&s;t Fellow a&s;ide, pretending to tell his Fortune. Now when they were alone together in a remote Part of the Barn, whither it proceeded from the &s;trong Liquor, which is never &s;o apt to inflame inordinate De&s;ire as after moderate Fatigue, or whither the fair <HI>Gyp&s;y</HI> her|&s;elf threw a&s;ide the Delicacy and Decency of her Sex, and tempted the Youth <HI>Partridge</HI> with expre&s;s Solicitations; but they were di&s;covered in a very im|proper Manner by the Hu&s;band of the <HI>Gyp&s;y,</HI> who from Jealou&s;y, it &s;eems, had kept a watchful Eye over his Wife, and had dogged her to the Place, where he found her in the Arms of her Gallant.</P>
<P>To the great Coufu&s;ion of <HI>Jones, Partridge</HI> was now hurried before the King; who heard the Accu&s;ation, and likewi&s;e the Culprit's Defence, which was indeed very trifling: For the poor Fellow was confounded by the plain Evidence which appeared again&s;t him, and had very little to &s;ay for him&s;elf. His Maje&s;ty then turning towards <HI>Jones,</HI> &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'Sir, you have hear what dey &s;ay, what Puni&s;hment do you tink your Man de&s;erve?'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">'He was &s;orry for what had hap|pened, and that <HI>Partridge</HI> &s;hould make the Hu&s;band all the Amends in his Power: He &s;aid, he had ve|ry little Money about him at that Time, and put|ting his Hand into his Pocket, offered the Fellow a Guinea.'</Q> To which he immediately an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">He hoped his Honour would not think of giving him le&s;s than five.'</Q></P>
<P>This Sum after &s;ome Altercation was reduced to two, and <HI>Jones</HI> having &s;tipulated for the full Forgive|ne&s;s of both <HI>Partridge</HI> and the Wife, was going to pay the Money; when his Maje&s;ty re&s;training his Hand, turned to the Witne&s;s, and a&s;ked him, <Q REND="inline">'At what Time he had di&s;covered the Criminals?'

The King then a&s;ked, 'If the Hu&s;band was with him all that Time in his lurk|ing Place?'</Q> To which he an&s;wered in the Affirma|tive. His <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Maje&s;ty then addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the Hu&s;band as follows, <Q REND="inline">'Me be &s;orry to &s;ee any <HI>Gyp&s;y</HI> dat have no more Honour dan to &s;ell de Ho|nour of his Wife for Money.

<P>The <HI>Gyp&s;ies</HI> immediately proceeded to execute the Sentence, and left <HI>Jones</HI> and <HI>Partridge</HI> alone with his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> greatly applauded the Ju&s;tice of the Sentence; upon which the King turning to him &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'Me be|lieve you be &s;urprize: For me &s;uppo&s;e you have ver bad Opinion of my People; me &s;uppo&s;e you tink us all de Tieves.'</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">'Me vil tell you,' &s;aid the King, how the Differ|ence is between you and us. My People rob your People, and your People rob one anoder.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> afterwards proceeded very gravely to &s;ing forth the Happine&s;s of tho&s;e Subjects who lived under &s;uch a Magi&s;trate.</P>
<P><PB N="402" REF="411">
Indeed their Happine&s;s appears to have been &s;o com|pleat, that we are aware le&s;t &s;ome Advocate for arbi|trary Power &s;hould hereafter quote the Ca&s;e of tho&s;e People, as an In&s;tance of the great Advantages which attend that Government above all others.</P>
<P>And here we will make a conce&s;&s;ion, which would not perhaps have been expected from us, That no li|mited Form of Government is capable of ri&s;ing to the &s;ame Degree of Perfection, or of producing the &s;ame Benefits to Society with this. Mankind have never been &s;o happy, as when the greate&s;t Part of the then known World was under the Dominion of a &s;ingle Ma&s;ter; and this State of their Felicity continued during the Reigns of five &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Princes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Nerva, Trajan, Adrian,</HI> and the two <HI>Antonini.</HI></NOTE>. This was the true Aera of the Golden Age, and the only Golden Age which ever had any Exi&s;tence, unle&s;s in the warm Imaginations of the Poets, from the Ex|pul&s;ion from <HI>Eden</HI> down to this Day.</P>
<P>In reality, I know but of one &s;olid Objection to ab&s;olute Monarchy. The only Defect of this ex|cellent Con&s;titution &s;eems to be the Difficulty of find|ing any Man adequate to the Office of an ab&s;olute Monarch: For this indi&s;pen&s;ably requires three Qua|lities very difficult, as it appears from Hi&s;tory, to be found in princely Natures: Fir&s;t a &s;ufficient Quantity of Moderation in the Prince, to be contented with all the Power which is po&s;&s;ible for him to have. 2dly, Enough of Wi&s;dom to know his own Happine&s;s. And, 3dly, Goodne&s;s &s;ufficient to &s;upport the Happi|ne&s;s of others, when not only compatible with, but in&s;trumental to his own.</P>
<P>Now if an ab&s;olute Monarch with all the&s;e great and rare Qualifications &s;hould be allowed capable of conferring the greate&s;t Good on Society, it mu&s;t be &s;urely granted, on the contrary, that ab&s;olute Power ve&s;ted in the Hands of one who is deficient in them all, is likely to be attended with no le&s;s a Degree of Evil.</P>
<P><PB N="403" REF="412">
In &s;hort our own Religion furni&s;hes us with ade|quate Ideas of the Ble&s;&s;ing, as well as Cur&s;e which may attend ab&s;olute Power. The Pictures of Hea|ven and of Hell will place a very lively Image of both before our Eyes: For though the Prince of the latter can have no Power, but what he originally derives from the omnipotent Sovereign in the former; yet it plainly appears from Scripture, that ab&s;olute Power in his in|fernal Dominions, is granted to their Diabolical Ru|ler. This is indeed the only ab&s;olute Power which can by Scripture be derived from Heaven. If there|fore the &s;everal Tyrannies upon Earth can prove any Title to a divine Authority, it mu&s;t be derived from this original Grant to the Prince of Darkne&s;s, and the&s;e &s;ubordinate Deputations mu&s;t con&s;equently come immediately from him who&s;e Stamp they &s;o expre&s;ly bear.</P>
<P>To conclude, as the Examples of all Ages &s;hew us that Mankind in general de&s;ire Power only to do Harm, and when they obtain it, u&s;e it for no other Purpo&s;e; it is not con&s;onant with even the lea&s;t Degree of Pru|dence to hazard an Alteration, where our Hopes are poorly kept in Countenance by only two or three Ex|ceptions out of a thou&s;and In&s;tances to alarm our Fears. In this Ca&s;e it will be much wi&s;er to &s;ubmit to a few Inconveniencies ari&s;ing from the di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate Deafne&s;s of Laws than to remedy them by applying to the pa&s;&s;ionate open Ears of a Tyrant.</P>
<P>Nor can the Examples of the <HI>Gyp&s;ies,</HI> tho' po&s;&s;ibly they may have long been happy under this Form of Government, be here urged; &s;ince we mu&s;t remember the very material Re&s;pect in which they differ from all other People, and to which perhaps this their Happi|ne&s;s is entirely owing, namely, that they have no fal&s;e Honours among them; and that they look on Shame as the mo&s;t grievous Puni&s;hment in the World.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. <HI>A Dialogue between</HI> Jones <HI>and</HI> Partridge.</HEAD>
<P>THE hone&s;t Lovers of Liberty will we doubt not pardon that long Digre&s;&s;ion into which we were led at the Clo&s;e of the la&s;t Chapter, to prevent our Hi&s;tory from being applied to the U&s;e of the mo&s;t pernicious Doctrine, which Prie&s;tcraft had ever the Wickedne&s;s or the Impudence to preach.</P>
<P>We will now proceed with Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> who when the Storm was over, took Leave of his <HI>Egyptian</HI> Ma|je&s;ty, after many Thanks for his courteous Behaviour and kind Entertainment, and &s;et out for <HI>Coventry;</HI> to which Place (for it was &s;till dark) a <HI>Gyp&s;y</HI> was order|ed to conduct him.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> having by Rea&s;on of his Deviation, travelled eleven Miles in&s;tead of &s;ix, and mo&s;t of tho&s;e through very execrable Roads, where no Expedition could have been made, in Que&s;t of a Midwife, did not arrive at <HI>Coventry</HI> till near Twelve. Nor could he po&s;&s;ibly get again into the Saddle till pa&s;t Two; for Po&s;t-Hor&s;es were now not ea&s;y to get; nor were the Ho&s;tler or Po&s;t-Boy, in half &s;o great a Hurry as him&s;elf, but cho&s;e rather to imitate the tranquil Di&s;po&s;ition of <HI>Par|tridge;</HI> who being denied the Nouri&s;hment of Sleep, took all Opportunities to &s;upply its Place with every other Kind of Nouri&s;hment, and was never better plea&s;ed than when he arrived at an Inn, nor ever more di&s;&s;atisfied than when he was again forced to leave it.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> now travelled Po&s;t; we will follow him therefore, according to our Cu&s;tom, and to the Rules of <HI>Longinus,</HI> in the &s;ame Manner. From <HI>Coventry</HI> he arrived at <HI>Daventry,</HI> from <HI>Daventry</HI> at <HI>Stratford,</HI> and from <HI>Stratford</HI> at <HI>Dun&s;table,</HI> whither he came the next Day a little after Noon, and within a few Hours after <HI>Sophia</HI> had left it; and though he was ob|liged to &s;tay here longer than he wi&s;hed, while a
<PB N="405" REF="414">
Smith, with great Deliberation, &s;hoed the Po&s;t-Hor&s;e he was to ride, he doubted not but to overtake his <HI>So|phia</HI> before &s;he &s;hould &s;et out from <HI>St. Albans;</HI> at which Place he concluded, and very rea&s;onably, that his Lord&s;hip would &s;top and dine.</P>
<P>And had he been right in this Conjecture, he mo&s;t probably would have overtaken his Angel at the afore|&s;aid Place; but unluckily my Lord had appointed a Dinner to be prepared for him at his own Hou&s;e in <HI>London,</HI> and in order to enable him to reach that Place in proper Time, he had ordered a Relay of Hor&s;es to meet him at <HI>St. Albans.</HI> When <HI>Jones</HI> therefore arrived there, he was informed that the Coach and Six had &s;et out two Hours before.</P>
<P>If fre&s;h Po&s;t-Hor&s;es had been now ready, as they were not, it &s;eemed &s;o apparently impo&s;&s;ible to over|take the Coach before it reached <HI>London,</HI> that <HI>Par|tridge</HI> thought he had now a proper Opportunity to remind his Friend of a Matter which he &s;eemed entire|ly to have forgotton; what this was the Reader will gue&s;s, when we inform him that <HI>Jones</HI> had eat no|thing more than one poached Egg &s;ince he had left the Alehou&s;e where he had fir&s;t met the Guide returning from <HI>Sophia;</HI> for with the Gyp&s;ies, he had only fea&s;t|ed his Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>The Landlord &s;o entirely agreed with the Opinion of Mr. <HI>Partridge,</HI> that he no &s;ooner heard the latter de&s;ire his Friend to &s;tay and dine, than he very readily put in his Word, and retracting his Promi&s;e before given of furni&s;hing the Hor&s;es immediately, he a&s;&s;ur|ed Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> he would lo&s;e no Time in be&s;peaking a Dinner, which, he &s;aid, could be got ready &s;ooner than it was po&s;&s;ible to get the Hor&s;es up from Gra&s;s, and to prepare them for their Journey by a Feed of Corn.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> was at length prevailed on, chiefly by the latter Argument of the Landlord; and now a Joint of Mutton was put down to the Fire. While this was
<PB N="406" REF="415">
preparing, <HI>Partridge</HI> being admitted into the &s;ame Apartment with his Friend or Ma&s;ter, began to ha|rangue in the following Manner.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Certainly, Sir, if ever Man de&s;erved a young La|dy, you de&s;erve young Madam <HI>We&s;tern;</HI> for what a va&s;t Quantity of Love mu&s;t a Man have, to be able to live upon it without any other Food, as you do. I am po&s;itive I have eat thirty times as much within the&s;e la&s;t twenty four Hours as your Honour, and yet I am almo&s;t fami&s;hed; for nothing makes a Man &s;o hungry as travelling, e&s;pecially in this cold raw weather. And yet I can't tell how it is, but your Honour is &s;eemingly in perfect good Health, and you never looked better nor fre&s;her in your Life. It mu&s;t certainly be Love that you live upon.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'And very rich Diet too, <HI>Partridge.'</HI> an&s;wered <HI>Jones.</HI> But did not Fortune &s;end me an excellent Dainty Ye&s;terday? Do&s;t thou imagine I cannot live more than twenty-four Hours on this dear Pocket-Book.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Undoubtedly,' cries <HI>Partridge,</HI> there is enough in that Pocket-Book to purcha&s;e many a good Meal. Fortune &s;ent it to your Honour very opportunely for pre&s;ent U&s;e, as your Honour's Money mu&s;t be almo&s;t out by this Time.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'What do you mean?' an&s;wered <HI>Jones;</HI> I hope you don't imagine I &s;hould be di&s;hone&s;t enough, even if it belonged to any other Per&s;on, be&s;ides Mi&s;s <HI>We&s;tern&mdash;</HI>'</Q></P>

No indeed, I would have your Honour pay it again, as &s;oon as it is con|venient, by all Means; but where can be the Harm in making u&s;e of it now you want it. Indeed if it belonged to a poor Body, it would be another

thing; but &s;o great a Lady to be &s;ure can never want it, e&s;pecially now as &s;he is along with a Lord, who it can't be doubted will let her have whatever &s;he hath need of. Be&s;ides, if &s;he &s;hould wan't a little, &s;he can't want the whole, therefore I would give her a little; but I would be hanged before I mentioned the having found it at fir&s;t, and before I got &s;ome Money of my own; for <HI>Lon|don,</HI> I have heard, is the very wor&s;t of Places to be in without Money. Indeed, if I had not known to whom it belonged, I might have thought it was the Devil's Money, and have been afraid to u&s;e it; but as you know otherwi&s;e, and came ho|ne&s;tly by it, it would be an Affront to Fortune to part with it all again, at the very Time when you want it mo&s;t; you can hardly expect &s;he &s;hould ever do you &s;uch another good Turn; for <HI>Fortuna nunquam perpetuo e&s;t bona.</HI> You will do as you plea&s;e, notwith&s;tanding all I &s;ay; but for my Part, I would be hanged before I mentioned a Word of the Matter.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'By what I can &s;ee, <HI>Partridge,</HI> cries <HI>Jones,</HI> hanging is a Matter <HI>non longe alienum &agrave; Scaevolae &s;tudiis.'</HI> You &s;hould &s;ay <HI>alienus,'</HI> &s;ays <HI>Partridge&mdash;</HI>I remember the Pa&s;&s;age; it is an Example under <HI>Communis, Alienus, immunis, variis ca&s;ibus, &s;ervi|unt.'</HI> If you do remember it,' cries <HI>Jones,</HI> 'I find you don't under&s;tand it; but I tell thee, Friend, in plain <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that he who finds another's Pro|perty, and wilfully detains it from the known Own|er, de&s;erves <HI>in Foro Con&s;cientiae,</HI> to be hanged no le&s;s than if he had &s;tolen it. And as for this very identical Bill, which is the Property of my Angel, and was once in her dear Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, I will not deliver it into any Hands but her own, upon any Con&s;ideration whatever: No, tho' I was as hun|gry as thou art, and had no other Means to &s;atisfy

<P><Q REND="inline">'I &s;hould not have mentioned it now, cries <HI>Par|tridge,</HI> if it had appeared &s;o to me; for I'm &s;ure I &s;corn any Wickedne&s;s as much as another; but perhaps you know better; and yet I might have ima|gined that I &s;hould not have lived &s;o many Years, and have taught School &s;o long, without being able to di&s;tingui&s;h between <HI>Fas &amp; Nefas;</HI> but it &s;eems we are to live and learn.

I have lived to a fine Purpo&s;e truly, if I am to be taught my Grammar at this Time of Day. Perhaps, young Gentleman, you may change your Opinion if you live to my Years: For I remember I thought my&s;elf as wi&s;e when I was a Stripling of one or two and twenty as I am now. I am &s;ure I always taught <HI>alienus,</HI> and my Ma&s;ter read it &s;o before me.'</Q></P>
<P>There were not many In&s;tances in which <HI>Partridge</HI> could provoke <HI>Jones,</HI> nor were there many in which <HI>Partridge</HI> him&s;elf could have been hurried out of his Re&s;pect. Unluckily however they had both hit on one of the&s;e. We have already &s;een <HI>Partridge</HI> could not bear to have his Learning attacked, nor could <HI>Jones</HI> bear &s;ome Pa&s;&s;age or other in the fore|going Speech. And now looking upon his Compa|nion with a contemptuous and di&s;dainful Air (a thing not u&s;ual with him) he cried, <Q REND="inline"><HI>'Partridge,</HI> I &s;ee thou art a conceited old Fool, and I wi&s;h thou art not likewi&s;e an old Rogue. Indeed if I was as well convinced of the latter as I am of the former,

thou &s;hould&s;t travel no farther in my Company.'</Q></P>
<P>The &s;age Pedagogue was contented with the Vent which he had already given to his Indignation; and, as the vulgar Phra&s;e is, immediately drew in his Horns. He &s;aid, He was &s;orry he had uttered any thing which might give Offence, for that he had never intended it; but <HI>Nemo omnibus horis &s;apit.</HI></P>
<P>As <HI>Jones</HI> had the Vices of a warm Di&s;po&s;ition, he was entirely free from tho&s;e of a cold one; and if his Friends mu&s;t have confe&s;t his Temper to have been a little too ea&s;ily ruffled, his Enemies mu&s;t at the &s;ame Time have confe&s;t, that it as &s;oon &s;ub&s;ided; nor did it at all re&s;emble the Sea, who&s;e Swelling is more violent and dangerous after a Storm is over, than while the Storm it&s;elf &s;ub&s;i&s;ts. He in&s;tantly accepted the Submi&s;&s;ion of <HI>Partridge,</HI> &s;hook him by the Hand, and with the mo&s;t benign A&s;pect imaginable, &s;aid twenty kind Things, and at the &s;ame Time ve|ry &s;everely condemned him&s;elf, tho' not half &s;o &s;e|verely as he will mo&s;t probably be condemned by ma|ny of our good Readers.</P>
<P><HI>Partridge</HI> was now highly comforted, as his Fears of having offended were at once aboli&s;hed, and his Pride completely &s;atified by <HI>Jones</HI>'s having owned him|&s;elf in the wrong, which Submi&s;&s;ion he in&s;tantly ap|plied to what had principally nettled him, and repeat|ed, in a muttering Voice, <Q REND="inline">'To be &s;ure, Sir, your Knowledge may be &s;uperior to mine in &s;ome Things; but as to the Grammar, I think I may chal|lenge any Man living.

<P>If any thing could add to the Satisfaction which the poor Man now enjoyed, he received this Addition by the Arrival of an excellent Shoulder of Mutton, that at this In&s;tant came &s;moaking to the Table.

<P>THEY were got about two Miles beyond <HI>Bar|nett,</HI> and it was now the Du&s;k of the Evening, when a genteel looking Man, but upon a very &s;habby Hor&s;e, rode up to <HI>Jones,</HI> and a&s;ked him whether he was going to <HI>London,</HI> to which <HI>Jones</HI> an&s;wered in the affirmative.

Here <HI>Partridge,</HI> could not forbear putting in his Word. <Q REND="inline">'Your Ho|nour, &s;aid he, may think it a little, but I am &s;ure, if I had a hundred Pound Bank Note in my Pocket, as you have, I &s;hould be very &s;orry to lo&s;e it; but, for my Part, I never was le&s;s afraid in my Life; for we are four of us, and if we all &s;tand by one another, the be&s;t Man in <HI>England</HI> can't rob us. Suppo&s;e he &s;hould have a Pi&s;tol, he can kill but one of us, and a Man can die but once, that's my Comfort, a Man can die but once.'</Q></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Reliance on &s;uperior Numbers, a kind of Valour which hath rai&s;ed a certain Nation among the Moderns to a high Pitch of Glory, there was ano|ther Rea&s;on for the extraordinary Courage which <HI>Partridge</HI> now di&s;covered; for he had at pre&s;ent as much of that Quality as was in the Power of Li|quor to be&s;tow.</P>
<P><PB N="411" REF="420">
Our Company were now arrived within a Mile of <HI>Highgate,</HI> when the Stranger turned &s;hort upon <HI>Jones,</HI> and pulling out a Pi&s;tol, demanded that little Bank Note which <HI>Partridge</HI> had mentioned.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> was at fir&s;t &s;omewhat &s;hocked at this unex|pected Demand; however, he pre&s;ently recollected him&s;elf, and told the Highwayman, all the Money he had in his Pocket was entirely at his Service; and &s;o &s;aying, he pulled out upwards of three Guineas, and offered to deliver it; but the other an&s;wered with an Oath, That would not do. <HI>Jones</HI> an&s;wered cooly, He was very &s;orry for it, and returned the Money into his Pocket.</P>
<P>The Highwayman then threatned, if he did not deliver the Bank Note that Moment, he mu&s;t &s;hoot him; holding his Pi&s;tol at the &s;ame Time very near to his Brea&s;t. <HI>Jones</HI> in&s;tantly caught hold of the Fel|low's Hand, which trembled &s;o that he could &s;carce hold the Pi&s;tol in it, and turned the Muzzle from him. A Struggle then en&s;ued, in which the former wre&s;ted the Pi&s;tol from the Hand of his Antagoni&s;t, and both came from their Hor&s;es on the Ground together, the Highwayman upon his Back, and the victorious <HI>Jones</HI> upon him.</P>
<P>The poor Fellow now began to implore Mercy of the Conqueror; for, to &s;ay the Truth, he was in Strength by no Means a Match for <HI>Jones.</HI> <Q REND="inline">'In|deed, Sir, &s;ays he, I could have had no Intention to &s;hoot you, for you will find the Pi&s;tol was not loaded. This is the fir&s;t Robbery I ever attempted, and I have been driven by Di&s;tre&s;s to this.'</Q></P>
<P>At this In&s;tant, at about a hundred and fifty Yards Di&s;tance, lay another Per&s;on on the Ground, roar|ing for Mercy in a much louder Voice than the High|wayman. This was no other than <HI>Partridge</HI> him|&s;elf, who endeavouring to make his E&s;cape from the Engagement, had been thrown from his Hor&s;e, and
<PB N="412" REF="421">
lay flat on his Face, not daring to look up, and ex|pecting every Minute to be &s;hot.</P>
<P>In this Po&s;ture he lay, till the Guide, who was no otherwi&s;e concerned than for his Hor&s;es, having &s;e|cured the &s;tumbling Bea&s;t, came up to him and told him, his Ma&s;ter had got the better of the Highway|man.</P>
<P><HI>Partridge</HI> leapt at this News, and ran back to the Place, where <HI>Jones</HI> &s;tood with his Sword drawn in his Hand to guard the poor Fellow; which <HI>Partridge</HI> no &s;ooner &s;aw, than he cried out, <Q REND="inline">'Kill the Villain, Sir, run him through the Body, kill him this In|&s;tant.'</Q></P>
<P>Luckily however for the poor Wretch he had fal|len into more merciful Hands; for <HI>Jones</HI> having ex|amined the Pi&s;tol, and found it to be really unloaded, began to believe all the Man had told him before <HI>Par|tridge</HI> came up; namely, that he was a Novice in the Trade, and that he had been driven to it by the Di&s;tre&s;s he mentioned, the greate&s;t indeed imagina|ble, that of five hungry Children, and Wife lying in of a &s;ixth, in the utmo&s;t Want and Mi&s;ery. The Truth of all which the Highwayman mo&s;t vehement|ly a&s;&s;erted, and offered to convince Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> of, if he would take the Trouble to go to his Hou&s;e, which was not above two Miles off; &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">'That he de&s;ired no Favour, but upon Condition of prov|ing all he had alledged.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> at fir&s;t pretended that he would take the Fel|low at his Word, and return with him, declaring that his Fate &s;hould depend entirely on the Truth of his Sto|ry. Upon this the poor Fellow immediately expre&s;&s;ed &s;o much Alacrity, that <HI>Jones</HI> was perfectly &s;atisfied with his Veracity, and began now to entertain Sentiments of Compa&s;&s;ion for him. He returned the Fellow his empty Pi&s;tol, advi&s;ed him to think of hone&s;ter Means of relieving his Di&s;tre&s;s, and gave him a couple of Guineas for the immediate Support of his Wife and
<PB N="413" REF="422">
his Family; adding, <Q REND="inline">'he wi&s;hed he had more for his Sake, but the hundred Pound that had been mentioned, was not his own.'</Q></P>
<P>Our Readers will probably be divided in their Opi|nions concerning this Action? &s;ome may applaud it perhaps as an Act of extraordinary Humanity, while tho&s;e of a more &s;aturnine Temper will con&s;ider it as a Want of Regard to that Ju&s;tice which every Man owes his Country. <HI>Partridge</HI> certainly &s;aw it in that Light; for he te&s;tified much Di&s;&s;atisfaction on the Occa&s;ion, quoted an old Proverb, and &s;aid, He &s;hould not wonder if the Rogue attacked them again before they reached <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>The Highwayman was full of Expre&s;&s;ions of Thankfulne&s;s and Gratitude. He actually dropt Tears, or pretended &s;o to do. He vowed he would immediately return home, and would never after|wards commit any &s;uch Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; whether he kept his Word or no, perhaps, may appear here|after.</P>
<P>Our Travellers having remounted their Hor&s;es, ar|rived in Town without encountering any new mi&s;|hap. On the Road much plea&s;ant Di&s;cour&s;e pa&s;&s;ed between <HI>Jones</HI> and <HI>Partridge,</HI> on the Subject of their la&s;t Adventure. In which <HI>Jones</HI> expre&s;t a great Com|pa&s;&s;ion for tho&s;e Highwaymen, who are, by una|voidable Di&s;tre&s;s, driven, as it were, to &s;uch illegal Cour&s;es, as generally bring them to a &s;hameful Death. <Q REND="inline">'I mean, &s;aid he, tho&s;e only who&s;e highe&s;t Guilt extends no farther than to Robbery, and who are never guilty of Cruelty nor in&s;ult to any Per&s;on, which is a Circum&s;tance that, I mu&s;t &s;ay, to the Honour of our Country, di&s;tingui&s;hes the Robbers of <HI>England</HI> from tho&s;e of all other Nations; for Murder is, among&s;t tho&s;e, almo&s;t in|&s;eparably incident to Robbery.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'No doubt, an&s;wered <HI>Partridge,</HI> it is better to take away one's Money than one'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Life, and yet it
<PB N="414" REF="423">
is very hard upon hone&s;t Men, that they can't tra|vel about their Bu&s;ine&s;s without being in Danger of the&s;e Villains. And to be &s;ure it would be better that all Rogues were hanged out of the Way, than that one hone&s;t Man &s;hould &s;uffer. For my own Part, indeed, I &s;hould not care to have the Blood of any of them on my own Hands; but it is very proper for the Law to hang them all. What Right hath any Man to take Sixpence from me, unle&s;s I give it him? Is there any hone&s;ty in &s;uch a Man?'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'No &s;urely, cries <HI>Jones,</HI> no more than there is in him who takes the Hor&s;es out of another Man's Stable, or who applies to his own U&s;e the Money which he finds, when he knows the Right Owner.'</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e Hints &s;topt the Mouth of <HI>Partridge,</HI> nor did he open it again till <HI>Jones</HI> having thrown &s;ome &s;arca&s;tical Jokes on his Cowardice, he offered to ex|cu&s;e him&s;elf on the Inequality of Fire Arms, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">'A thou&s;and naked Men are nothing to one Pi&s;tol; for though it is true, it will kill but one at a &s;ingle Di&s;charge, yet who can tell but that one may be him&s;elf.'</Q></P>
