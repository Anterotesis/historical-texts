<HEAD>AN ADDRESS TO YOUNG MINISTERS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I am gradually &s;tepping into the eternal &s;tate, to appear before the judgment-&s;eat of Chri&s;t, per|mit me to be&s;eech you, as you wi&s;h to promote his honour, and the eternal &s;alvation of your own and your hearers' &s;ouls,</P>
<P N="1">1. See that ye be REAL CHRISTIANS your&s;elves. I now more and more &s;ee, that nothing le&s;s than REAL, REAL Chri&s;tianity is fit to die with, and make an appearance be|fore God. Are ye then indeed <HI>born again, born from above, born of the Spirit? created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good works? &mdash;new creatures in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> having <HI>all old things pa&s;&s;ed away, and all things become new?</HI> Are ye indeed the cir|cumci&s;ion which <HI>wor&s;hip God in the Spirit,</HI> habitually read|ing, meditating, praying, preaching, conver&s;ing with your hearts, under the influence of the Holy Gho&s;t? Have you no <HI>confidence in the fle&s;h,</HI> no confidence in your &s;elf-righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, your learning, your addre&s;s, your care and diligence, your gifts and graces;&mdash;but being emptied of &s;elf, in every form, are <HI>poor in &s;pirit, le&s;s than the lea&s;t of all &s;aints,</HI> and the lea&s;t of all God's mercies; nay, the very <HI>chief of &s;inners</HI> in your own fight? Hath it plea&s;ed God <HI>to reveal his Son in</HI> you? and to in&s;truct you with a &s;trong hand, to count all things but lo&s;s for the excellency of the knowledge of Je&s;us Chri&s;t as your Lord, and to count them but dung, that you may win him and be found in him, not having your own righteou&s;ne&s;s, but the righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of God by faith,&mdash;and to know the power of his re&s;urrection, and the
<PB N="4" REF="3">
fellow&s;hip of his &s;ufferings,&mdash;and to pre&s;s toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. If you be, or become, <HI>gracele&s;s</HI> preachers or mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, how terrible is your condition! If you open your Bible, the &s;entence of your redoubled damnation fla&s;heth into your con&s;cience from every page. If you compo&s;e your &s;ermon, you but draw up a tremendous indictment again&s;t your&s;elves. If you argue again&s;t, or reprove other men's &s;ins, you but aggravate your own. If you publi&s;h the holy law of God, you but add to your rebellion again&s;t it, and make it an awful witne&s;s again&s;t your treacherous di&s;|&s;imulation. If you announce its threatenings, and mention <HI>hell</HI> with all its in&s;upportable torments, you but infeoff your&s;elves in it, and &s;erve your&s;elves heirs to it as the in|heritance appointed you by the Almighty. If you &s;peak of Chri&s;t and his excellencies, fulne&s;s, love, and labours, it is but to trample him under your feet. If you take his cove|nant and go&s;pel into your mouth, it is but to profane them, and ca&s;t them forth to be trodden under foot of men. If you talk of &s;piritual experiences, you do but de&s;pite to the Spirit of grace. If you commend Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, and invite &s;inners to new-covenant fellow&s;hip with them, you but treacherou&s;ly &s;tab them under the fifth rib, and betray them with a ki&s;s, and from your heart cry, This is the heir, the God, come let us kill him. While you hold up the gla&s;s of God's law or go&s;pel to others, you turn its back to your&s;elves. The go&s;pel, which ye preach to others, is hid,&mdash;is a &s;avour of death unto death to you, the vail re|maining on your hearts, and the God of this world having blinded your minds.&mdash;Without the &s;aving, the heart-trans|forming knowledge of Chri&s;t and him crucified, all your knowledge is but an accur&s;ed <HI>puffer up,</HI> and murderer of your own &s;ouls. And, unle&s;s the grace of God make <HI>an uncommon &s;tretch</HI> to &s;ave you, how de&s;perate is your condition! Per|haps no per&s;on under heaven bids more unlikely to be &s;aved, than a <HI>gracele&s;s mini&s;ter</HI>;&mdash;his con&s;cience is &s;o over|charged with guilt, &s;o &s;eared as with an hot iron, and his heart &s;o hardened by the abu&s;e of the go&s;pel.&mdash;Alas! my dear pupils, mu&s;t all my in&s;tructions, all the &s;trivings of the Holy Gho&s;t, all your reading, all your meditations, all your &s;ermons, all your evangelical principles, all your profe&s;&s;ion, all your prayers, as traps and &s;nares, take and bind any of you hand and foot, that you may be ca&s;t, as <HI>unprofitable &s;ervants,</HI> into <HI>utter darkne&s;s,</HI> with all the contents of your
<PB N="5" REF="4">
Bible and other books,&mdash;all your gifts and apparent-like graces, as it were, inlaid in your con&s;cienes, that, as fewel or oil, they may for ever feed, or enrage the flames of God's wrath upon your &s;ouls! After being &s;et for a time at the gate of heaven, to point others into it,&mdash;after prophe&s;ying in Chri&s;t's name, and wa&s;ting your&s;elves to &s;hew others the way of &s;alvation, and to light up the friends of our Redeemer to their heavenly re&s;t,&mdash;mu&s;t your own lamp go out in everla&s;ting darkne&s;s, and ye be bidden, <HI>Depart from me, I never knew you, ye workers of iniquity?</HI>&mdash;Mu&s;t I, mu&s;t all the churches behold you at la&s;t brought forth and con|demned as arch-traitors to our Redeemer? Mu&s;t you, for ever, in the mo&s;t tremendous manner, &s;ink into the bot|tomle&s;s pit, under the weight of the blood of the great God our Saviour,&mdash;under the weight of murdered truths, mur|dered convictions, murdered gifts, murdered mini&s;trations of the go&s;pel, and murdered &s;ouls of men!</P>
<P N="2">2. Ponder much, as before God, what proper FURNI|TURE you have for the mini&s;terial work, and labour to in|crea&s;e it. To him that hath &s;hall be given. Hath Je&s;us be&s;towed on you the Holy Gho&s;t? What di&s;tinct knowledge have you of the my&s;teries of the kingdom? What aptne&s;s have you to teach, bringing out of the good trea&s;ure of your own heart, <HI>things new and old?</HI> What ability to make the deep my&s;teries of the go&s;pel plain to per&s;ons of weak capa|cities, and to repre&s;ent things delightful or terrible, in a proper and affecting manner? What proper quickne&s;s in conceiving of divine things; and what rooted inclination to &s;tudy them, as per&s;ons devoted to matters of infinite im|portance? What peculiar fitne&s;s have you for the pulpit, qualifying you, in a plain, &s;erious, orderly and earne&s;t man|ner, to &s;crew the truths of God into the con&s;ciences of your hearers? With what &s;tock of &s;elf-experienced truths and texts of in&s;piration did, or do you enter on the mini&s;terial work? Of what truths, relative to the law of God,&mdash;or re|lative to &s;in, Satan, or the de&s;ertions and terrors of God, hath your &s;oul not only &s;een the evidence, but felt the power? What declarations, promi&s;es, offers and invi|tations, of the glorious go&s;pel, have ye, with joy and re|joicing of heart, found and eaten, and therein ta&s;ted and &s;een that God is good? Of what in&s;pired truths and texts can you &s;ay, <HI>Even &s;o we have believed, and therefore we &s;peak:</HI> what we have &s;een and heard with the Father, and ta&s;ted and handled of the word of life, that we declare unto you.
<PB N="6" REF="5">
Thrice happy preacher, who&s;e deeply experienced heart is, next to his Bible, his principal note-book!</P>
<P N="3">3. Take heed that your CALL from Chri&s;t and his Spirit to your mini&s;terial work be not only REAL but EVIDENT. Without this you can neither be duly excited or encou|raged to your work; nor hope, nor pray for divine &s;ucce&s;s in it; nor bear up aright under the difficulties you mu&s;t encounter, if you attempt to be faithful. If you run un&s;ent by Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his Spirit, notwith&s;tanding the utmo&s;t external regularity in your licence, call and ordina|tion, you, in the whole of your mini&s;trations, mu&s;t act the part of a &s;acrilegious thief and robber, a pretended and treacherous amba&s;&s;ador to Chri&s;t and his Father, and a murderer of men's &s;ouls, not profiting them at all. What direction,&mdash;what &s;upport,&mdash;what a&s;&s;i&s;tance,&mdash;what encou|ragement,&mdash;what reward, can you then expect? Ponder, therefore, as before God: Have you taken this honour to your&s;elves? or, Were ye called of God as was Aaron? Hath Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;ent you to preach the go&s;pel, and laid upon you a delightful and awful <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> to preach it? While he powerfully determined you to follow providence, and avoid every &s;elfi&s;h and irregular &s;tep towards entrance into the office, as a mean of <HI>eating a piece of bread,</HI> or en|joying carnal ea&s;e and honour, did he breathe on you, and cau&s;e you to receive the Holy Gho&s;t,&mdash;filling you with deep compa&s;&s;ion to the peri&s;hing &s;ouls of men, and a deep &s;en&s;e of your own unfitne&s;s for &s;uch arduous work, and fervent de&s;ire, that if the Lord were willing to u&s;e you as in&s;tru|ments of winning &s;ouls, he would &s;anctify you, and make you meet for his work?&mdash;Perhaps, providentially &s;hut out from other callings, to which you or your parents inclined, did you, in your education, go up <HI>bound in the Spirit</HI> by the love of Chri&s;t burning in your hearts, and con&s;training you cheerfully to &s;urrender your&s;elves to poverty, reproach, and hatred of men, for promoting his name and honour, and the &s;alvation of men in the world?&mdash;What oracles of God, powerfully impre&s;&s;ed on your &s;oul, have directed and en|couraged you to his work?&mdash;Know you in what form Je&s;us Chri&s;t gave you your commi&s;&s;ion? Whether to <HI>open the eyes of the Gentiles, and turn them from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of Satan unto God,&mdash;that they may receive forgivene&s;s of &s;ins and an inheritance among them who are &s;anctified by faith</HI> in him?&mdash;Or, to <HI>go make the heart of this people fat, their ears heavy,</HI> and to <HI>&s;hut their eyes.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. See that your END in entering into, or executing your
<PB N="7" REF="6">
office, be &s;ingle and di&s;intere&s;ted. Dare you appeal to him, who&s;e eyes are <HI>as a flame of fire,</HI> and who <HI>&s;earcheth the hearts and trieth the reins,</HI> to give to every man according to his works, that you never inclined to be put into the prie&s;t's office, that you might <HI>eat a piece of bread, and look every one for his gain from his quarter;</HI> that ye <HI>&s;eek not great things for your&s;elves</HI>; that ye <HI>covet no man's &s;ilver, gold,</HI> or <HI>apparel;</HI> that ye &s;eek not men's property, but <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> that you may win them to Chri&s;t for their eternal welfare; that ye &s;eek not your own honour, ea&s;e, or temporal ad|vantage, but the things of Chri&s;t and his people; that ye <HI>&s;eek not honour,</HI> or <HI>glory of men,</HI> but the honour of Chri&s;t and his Father, in the eternal &s;alvation of &s;ouls; and have determined to pro&s;ecute this end through whatever di&s;tre&s;s or danger the Lord may be plea&s;ed to lay in your way?</P>
<P N="5">5. See that your minds be deeply impre&s;&s;ed with the NA|TURE, EXTENT, and IMPORTANCE of your mini&s;terial work,&mdash;that therein it is required of you, as <HI>amba&s;&s;adors for Chri&s;t,</HI>&mdash;as <HI>&s;tewards</HI> of the my&s;teries and manifold grace of God,&mdash;<HI>to be faithful;</HI> to &s;erve the Lord with your &s;pirit, and with much humility in the go&s;pel of his Son: to te&s;tify repentance towards God and faith towards our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, not keeping back or &s;hunning to declare every part of the coun&s;el of God,&mdash;or any profitable in&s;truction, re|proof, or encouragement; and not moved with any re|proach, per&s;ecution, hunger or nakedne&s;s,&mdash;to be ready, not only to be bound, but to die for the name of the Lord Je&s;us, in order to fini&s;h your cour&s;e with joy. Bear|ing with the infirmities of the weak, and &s;triving toge|ther in prayer, that the word of the Lord may have free cour&s;e, and be glorified, and your me&s;&s;ages provided by God and made acceptable to your hearers, you mu&s;t la|bour with much fear and trembling, determined to know, to glory in, and make known, nothing but Je&s;us Chri&s;t and him crucified,&mdash;preaching the go&s;pel <HI>not with enticing words of man's wi&s;dom,</HI> as men-plea&s;ers, but with great plainne&s;s of &s;peech, in demon&s;tration of the Spirit and with power&mdash; &s;peaking the things which are freely given you by God, not in the words which man's wi&s;dom teacheth, but in <HI>words which the Holy Gho&s;t teacheth,</HI> comparing &s;piritual things with &s;piritual,&mdash;as having the mind of Chri&s;t, always triumphing in HIM,&mdash;and making manife&s;t the &s;avour of the knowledge of him in every place, that you may be a &s;weet &s;avour of Chri&s;t in them who are &s;aved, and in them who
<PB N="8" REF="7">
peri&s;h;&mdash;as of &s;incerity, as of God, in the &s;ight of God, &s;peaking in Chri&s;t, and through the mercy of God, not fainting, but renouncing the hidden things of di&s;hone&s;ty;&mdash; not walking in craftine&s;s, nor handling the word of God deceitfully, or corrupting the truth, but manife&s;ting the truth to every man's con&s;cience, as in the &s;ight of God;&mdash; not preaching your&s;elves, but Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Lord, and your|&s;elves &s;ervants to the church for his &s;ake, always bearing about his dying, that his life may be minife&s;ted in you;&mdash;and know|ing the terror of the Lord, and deeply impre&s;&s;ed with the account which you and your hearers mu&s;t give to him of your whole conduct, in the day of judgment,&mdash;awed by his infinite authority, and con&s;trained and enflamed by his love, you mu&s;t per&s;uade men, be&s;eeching them to be reconciled unto God, and making your&s;elves manife&s;t to God and to their con&s;cience,&mdash;and, as their edification requires, chang|ing your voice, and turning your&s;elves every way, and be|coming all things to all men, in order to gain them to Chri&s;t,&mdash;jealous over them with a godly jealou&s;y, in order to e&s;pou&s;e them to him, as cha&s;te virgins,&mdash;travailing in Birth, till he be formed in their hearts. You mu&s;t take heed to your mini&s;try which you have received in the Lord, that you may fulfil it;&mdash;&s;tir up the gifts which were given you,&mdash;give your&s;elves wholly to reading, exhortations, and doctrine;&mdash;and take heed to your&s;elves and to the doctrine which you preach, that you may &s;ave your&s;elves and them that hear you;&mdash;watching for their &s;ouls, as they who do and mu&s;t give an account for them to God,&mdash;rightly divid|ing the word of truth, and giving every man his portion in due &s;ea&s;on, faithfully warning every man with tears, night and day, teaching every man, particularly <HI>young ones,</HI> and labouring to pre&s;ent every man perfect in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,&mdash; and warring, not after the fle&s;h, nor with carnal weapons, but with &s;uch as are mighty through God to the pulling down of &s;trong holds and ca&s;ting down imaginations, and &s;ubduing every thought and affection to the obedience of Chri&s;t. Having him for the end of your conver&s;ation, and holding fa&s;t the form of &s;ound words in faith in, and love to him,&mdash;not entangling your&s;elves with the affairs of this life, nor a&s;hamed of the Lord or of his cau&s;e or pri&s;oners, but ready to endure hard&s;hips as good &s;oldiers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, ye mu&s;t go forth without the camp, bearing his reproach, and, expo&s;ed as &s;pectacles of &s;ufferings to angels and men, mu&s;t not faint under your tribulations, but feed the flock of
<PB N="9" REF="8">
God which he hath purcha&s;ed with his own blood, and over which the Holy Gho&s;t hath made you over&s;eers,&mdash; preaching the word in &s;ea&s;on and out of &s;ea&s;on, reproving, rebuking and exhorting with all long-&s;uffering and doc|trine,&mdash;taking the over&s;ight of your people, not by con|&s;traint, but willingly, not for filthy lucre of worldly gain, or larger &s;tipends, but of a ready mind,&mdash;neither as being lords over God's heritage, but as examples to the flock,&mdash; exerci&s;ing your&s;elves to have a con&s;cience void of offence towards God and towards man,&mdash;having a good con&s;cience willing in all things to live hone&s;tly,&mdash;exerci&s;ed to godli|ne&s;s,&mdash;kindly affectioned, di&s;intere&s;ted, holy, ju&s;t, and un|blameable,&mdash;prudent examples of the believers in conver|&s;ation, in charity, in faith and purity,&mdash;fleeing youthful lu&s;ts and following after righteou&s;ne&s;s, peace, faith, cha|rity,&mdash;not &s;triving, but being gentle unto all men,&mdash;in meekne&s;s in&s;tructing them who oppo&s;e them&s;elves,&mdash; avoiding fooli&s;h and unlearned que&s;tions,&mdash;and old wives fa|bles,&mdash;fleeing from perver&s;e di&s;putings and worldly mind|edne&s;s, as mo&s;t dangerous &s;nares; and following after righteou&s;ne&s;s, godline&s;s, faith, love, patience, meekne&s;s;&mdash; fighting the good fight of faith, and laying hold on eternal life,&mdash;keeping your tru&s;t of go&s;pel truth and mini&s;terial office, and without partiality or precipitancy, committing the &s;ame to faithful men, who may be able to teach others;&mdash;and, in fine, faithfully labouring, in the Lord, to try, and confute, and cen&s;ure fal&s;e teachers, publicly re|buke, or excommunicate open tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, re&s;tore &s;uch as have been overtaken in a fault in the &s;pirit of meekne&s;s,&mdash; and having compa&s;&s;ion on them, to pull them out of the fire, hating even the garment &s;potted by the fle&s;h, and ne|ver conniving at, or partaking with any in their &s;ins. Who is &s;ufficient for the&s;e things? May your &s;ufficincy be of God; and as your days are, &s;o may your &s;trength be.</P>
<P N="6">6. See that ye take heed to your &s;pirits, that ye deal not TREACHEROUSLY with the Lord. In approaching to, or executing the mini&s;terial office, keep your hearts with all diligence; for out of it are the i&s;&s;ues of eternal life or death to your&s;elves and others. Building up your&s;elves on your mo&s;t holy faith, and praying in the Holy Gho&s;t, keep your|&s;elves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t unto the eternal life. If you do not <HI>ar|dently</HI> love Chri&s;t, how can you <HI>faithfully</HI> and <HI>diligently</HI> feed his lambs&mdash;his &s;heep? Alas! how many precious
<PB N="10" REF="9">
&s;ermons, exhortations and in&s;tructions are quite marred and poi&s;oned by coming through the cold, carnal, and carele&s;s heart of the preacher, and being attended with his impru|dent, untender, and lukewarm life? If you have not a deep-felt experience of the terrors of the Lord,&mdash;of the bitterne&s;s of &s;in, vanity of this world, and importance of eternity,&mdash;and of the con&s;cience quieting and heart-capti|vating virtue of Je&s;us' bleeding love, how can you be duly &s;erious and hearty in preaching the go&s;pel? If, all in|fluenced by a predominate love to Chri&s;t, your heart be not fixed on everla&s;ting things, and powerfully animated to an eager following of peace and holine&s;s, how can you, with|out the mo&s;t abominable treachery, declare to men their chief happine&s;s, and the true method of obtaining it? If your graces be not kept lively, your loins girt, and your lamps burning, all enkindled by the heart-con&s;training love of Chri&s;t, how cold, carnal and bla&s;ted mu&s;t be your &s;acred mini&s;trations? If your work, as amba&s;&s;adors of Chri&s;t, be to tran&s;act matters of everla&s;ting importance between an infinite God and immortal, but peri&s;hing, &s;ouls of men; if the honours and privileges of it be &s;o invaluable, what inexpre&s;&s;ible need have you of habitual dependence on Chri&s;t by a lively faith? What &s;elf-denial, what ardent love to Chri&s;t and his Father, what di&s;intere&s;ted regard to his honour, what compa&s;&s;ion to &s;ouls, what prudence, what faithfulne&s;s and diligence, what humility and holy zeal, what &s;pirituality of mind and conver&s;ation, what order, what plainne&s;s, what fervour, what ju&s;t temperature of mildne&s;s, and &s;everity;&mdash;is nece&s;&s;ary in every part of it!&mdash;If, while you mini&s;ter in holy things, your lu&s;ts prevail and are in|dulged, you have le&s;s of real or lively Chi&s;tianity than the mo&s;t weak and uncircum&s;pect &s;aints under your charge;&mdash; if your evil heart of unblief fearfully carry you off from the living God, and you can live unconcerned while the power|ful and &s;anctifying pre&s;ence of God is withheld from your|&s;elves or your flocks,&mdash;how &s;ad is your and their ca&s;e!&mdash; If your indwelling pride be allowed to choo&s;e your com|pany, your dre&s;s, your victuals,&mdash;nay, your text, your &s;ub|ject, your order, your language;&mdash;if it be allowed to indite your thoughts, and, to the reproach and bla&s;ting of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, to deck your &s;ermon with tawdry orna|ments and fancies, as if it were a &s;tage play, and to blunt and muffle up its &s;harp arrows with &s;ilken &s;moothne&s;s and &s;wollen bomba&s;t;&mdash;if it be allowed to kindle your fervour,
<PB N="11" REF="10">
and form your looks, your tone, your action;&mdash;or to render you enraptured or &s;elf-conceited, becau&s;e of &s;ub&s;equent applau&s;e;&mdash;or &s;ad and provoked, becau&s;e your labours are contemned, how dreadful is your danger and that of your hearers! How can mini&s;terial labours originating in pride, &s;purred on by the fame of learning, diligence or holine&s;s, &mdash;hurt the intere&s;ts of Satan, from who&s;e influence they proceed?&mdash;If pride be allowed to cau&s;e you to envy or wound the characters of &s;uch as differ from, or out&s;hine you, or to make you reluctant to Chri&s;tian reproof from your inferiors, how fearful is your guilt and danger! Pride indulged is no more con&s;i&s;tent with a Chri&s;tian character, than drunkenne&s;s and whoredom.&mdash;If you take up or cleave to any principle or practice in religion, in the way of facti|ous contention, how abominable to God is the <HI>&s;ower of di&s;cord among brethren!</HI> If you undervalue the peace and pro&s;perity of the church of Chri&s;t, and are not afflicted with her in all her afflictons, how cruel and unchri&s;t-like your conduct! If, in ju&s;tly proving your opponent deceivers and bla&s;phemers, you, by your angry manner, plead the cau&s;e of the devil, will God accept it as an offering at your hands? If you are &s;lothful in &s;tudying or declaring the truths of Chri&s;t,&mdash;if to &s;ave labour or expence, you are in|active or aver&s;e to help &s;uch as have no fixed mini&s;trations, or to contrive or pro&s;ecute projects for advancing the king|dom of Chri&s;t, and promoting the &s;alvation of men, how great is your ba&s;ene&s;s, and fearful your hazard!&mdash;&mdash;Think, as before God, did Je&s;us Chri&s;t furni&s;h you for, and put you into the mini&s;try, that you might idle away, or pro&s;titute your devoted time, tear his church, conceal or mangle his truths, betray his intere&s;ts, or &s;tarve and murder the &s;ouls of men?

<P N="7">7. See that ye, as workmen who need not be a&s;hamed, earne&s;tly labour RIGHTLY TO DIVIDE the word of truth, according to the capacities, needs, and particular occa&s;ions of your hearers, giving every one of them their portion in due &s;ea&s;on. Never make your own ca&s;e, your inclination or honour, but the need of &s;ouls, and the glory of Chri&s;t, the regulator of your choice of &s;ubjects. Labour chiefly on the principal points of religion. To bring down the funda|mental my&s;teries of the go&s;pel to the capacities of your hearers, and inculcate on their con&s;ciences the great points of union and fellow&s;hip with Chri&s;t, regeneration, ju&s;tifica|tion and &s;anctification, will require all your grace, learning and labour. Never aim at tickling the ears or plea&s;ing the fancies of your hearers, but at convincing their con&s;ciences, enlightening their minds, attracting their affections, and re|newing their wills, that they may be per&s;uaded and enabled to embrace and improve Je&s;us Chri&s;t as freely offered to them in the go&s;pel, for wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctifi|cation and redemption. Labour to preach the law as a broken covenant,&mdash;the go&s;pel of &s;alvation,&mdash;and the law as a rule of life,&mdash;not only in their exten&s;ive matter, but al&s;o in their proper order and connexion. It is only when they are properly connected, that the precious truths of God appear in their true lu&s;tre and glory.

I look upon the Sece&s;&s;ion as indeed the cau&s;e of God, but &s;adly mi&s;managed and di&s;|honoured by my&s;elf and others. Alas! for that pride, pa&s;|&s;ion, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and unconcern for the glory of Chri&s;t, and &s;piritual edification of &s;ouls, which hath &s;o often prevailed! &mdash;Alas! for our want of due meekne&s;s, gentlene&s;s, holy zeal, &s;elf-denial, hearty grief for &s;in, compa&s;&s;ion to &s;ouls in immediate connexion with us, or left in the e&s;tabli&s;hed church which became di&s;tingui&s;hed witne&s;&s;es for Chri&s;t. Alas! that we did not chiefly &s;trive to <HI>pray better, preach better,</HI> and <HI>live better</HI> than our neighbours.&mdash;Study to &s;ee every thing with your own eyes, but never indulge an itch after novelties: mo&s;t of tho&s;e, which are now e&s;teemed &s;uch, are nothing but <HI>old errors,</HI> which were long ago ju&s;tly refuted, varni&s;hed over with &s;ome new expre&s;&s;ions. Never, by your peevi&s;hne&s;s, contentions, eagerne&s;s about worldly things, or the like, make others think lightly of the cau&s;e of God among your hands. If I mi&s;take not, the churches are entering into a fearful cloud of apo&s;tacy and trouble. But he that endureth to the end &s;hall be &s;aved.
