<HEAD>PREFACE To the OCTAVO EDITION of DR. GOLDSMITH's ROMAN HISTORY.</HEAD>
<P>"THERE are &s;ome &s;ubjects on which a writer mu&s;t decline all attempts to acquire fame, &s;atisfied with being ob|&s;curely u&s;eful. After &s;uch a number of Roman Hi&s;tories, in all languages, ancient and modern, it would be but impo&s;ture to pretend new di&s;coveries, or to expect to offer any thing in a work of this kind, which has not been often anticipated by others. The facts which it relates have been an hundred times repeated, and ever occurrence has been &s;o variou&s;ly con&s;idered, that learning can &s;carely find a new anecdote, or geni|us give novelty to the old.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="5">"I HOPE, therefore, for the reader's indulgence, if in the following attempt it &s;hall appear, that my only aim was to &s;upply a conci&s;e, plain, and unaffected narrative of the ri&s;e and decline of a well known empire; I was contented to make &s;uch a book, as could not fail of being &s;erviceable, though, of all others, the mo&s;t unlikely to promote the repu|tation of the writer. In&s;tead, therefore, of pre&s;&s;ing forward among the ambitious, I only claim the merit of knowing my own &s;trength, and falling back among the hindmo&s;t ranks, with con&s;cious in|feriority.</P>
<P>"I AM not ignorant, however, that it would be no &s;uch difficult ta&s;k to pur|&s;ue the &s;ame arts by which many dull men, every day, acquire a reputation in hi&s;tory; &s;uch might ea&s;ily be attained, by fixing on &s;ome ob&s;cure period to write upon, where much &s;eeming erudi|tion might be di&s;played, almo&s;t un|known, becau&s;e not worth remembering; and many maxims in politics might be
<PB N="iii" REF="6">
advanced entirely new, becau&s;e alto|gether fal&s;e. But I have pur&s;ued a con|trary method, chu&s;ing the mo&s;t noted periods in hi&s;tory, and offering no re|marks but &s;uch as I thought &s;trictly true.</P>
<P>"THE rea&s;ons of my choice were, that we had no hi&s;tory of this &s;plendid period in our language, but what was either too voluminous for common u&s;e, or too meanly written to plea&s;e. Catrou and Rouille's Hi&s;tory, in &s;ix volumes folio, tran&s;lated into our language by Bundy, is entirely un&s;uited to the time and ex|pence mankind u&s;ually chu&s;e to be&s;tow upon this &s;ubject: Rollin, and his con|tinuator, Crevier, making above thirty volumes octavo, &s;eem to labour under the &s;ame imputation; as likewi&s;e Hooke, who has &s;pent three quartos upon the republic alone; the re&s;t or his undertaking remain|ing unfini&s;hed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A fourth volume has been &s;ince publi&s;hed.</NOTE>. There only, therefore, remained the Hi&s;tory by Echard, in five volumes octavo, who&s;e plan and mine
<PB N="iv" REF="7">
&s;eemed to coincide; and had his execu|tion been equal to his de&s;ign, it had pre|cluded the pre&s;ent undertaking. But the truth is, it is &s;o poorly written, the facts &s;o crowded, the narration &s;o &s;pirit|le&s;s, and the characters &s;o indi&s;tinctly marked, that the mo&s;t ardent curio&s;ity mu&s;t cool in the peru&s;al; and the noble&s;t tran&s;actions that ever warmed the hu|man heart, as de&s;cribed by him, mu&s;t cea&s;e to intere&s;t.</P>
<P>"I HAVE endeavoured, therefore, in the pre&s;ent work (or rather compilation) to obviate the inconveniencies ari&s;ing from the exuberance of the former, as well as from the unplea&s;antne&s;s of the latter. Too much time may be given even to laud|able pur&s;uits, and there is none more apt than this, to allure the &s;tudent from more nece&s;&s;ary branches of learning, and, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, entirely to engro&s;s his indu&s;try. What is here offered, there|fore, may be &s;uffi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ient for all but &s;uch as make hi&s;tory the peculiar bu&s;ine&s;s of their
<PB N="v" REF="8">
lives; to &s;uch, the mo&s;t tedious narra|tive will &s;eem but an abridgement, as they mea&s;ure the merits of a work, rather by the quantity, than the quality, of its contents. Others, however, who think more &s;oberly, will agree, that in &s;o ex|ten&s;ive a field as that of the tran&s;actions of Rome, more judgment may be &s;hewn, by &s;electing what is important, than by adding what is ob&s;cure. The hi&s;tory of this empire has been extended to &s;ix volumes folio; and I aver, that, with very little learning, it might be encrea&s;ed to &s;ixteen more; but what would this be, but to load the &s;ubject with unimpor|tant facts, and &s;o to weaken the narra|tion, that, like the empire it de&s;cribed, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;ink beneath the weight of its own acqui&s;itions!</P>
<P>"BUT while I thus have endeavoured to avoid prolixity, it was found no ea&s;y matter to prevent crowding the facts, and to give every narrative its proper play In reality, no art can contrive to avoid oppo&s;ite defects; he who indulges in
<PB N="vi" REF="9">
minute particularities, will be often lan|guid; and he who &s;tudies conci&s;ene&s;s, will as frequently be dry and unenter|taining. As it was my aim to comprize as much as po&s;&s;ible in the &s;malle&s;t com|pa&s;s, it is feared the work will often be &s;ubject to the latter imputation; but it was impo&s;&s;ible to furni&s;h the public with a cheap Roman hi&s;tory, and at the &s;ame time to give all that warmth to the narrative, all tho&s;e colour|ings to the de&s;cription, which works of twenty times the bulk have room to exhibit. I &s;hall be fully &s;atisfied, there|fore, if it furni&s;hes an intere&s;t &s;ufficient to allure the reader to the end; and this is a claim to which few abridgements can ju&s;tly make preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>"To the&s;e objections, there are &s;ome who may add, that I have rejected many of the modern improvements in Roman hi&s;tory, and that every character is left in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that fame or infamy which it obtained from its cotempora|ries, or tho&s;e who wrote immediately
<PB N="vii" REF="10">
after. I acknowledge the charge, for it appears now too late to rejudge the vir|tues or the vices of tho&s;e men, who were but very incompletely known even to their own hi&s;torians. The Romans, per|haps, upon many occa&s;ions, formed wrong ideas of virtue; but they were by no means &s;o ignorant or abandoned in general, as not to give their brighte&s;t characters the greate&s;t &s;hare of their ap|plau&s;e; and I do not know whether it be fair, to try pagan actions by the &s;tan|dard of Chri&s;tian morality.</P>
<P>"BUT, whatever may be my execution of this work, I have very little doubts about the &s;ucce&s;s of the undertaking; the &s;ubject is the noble&s;t that ever employed human attention; and in&s;tead of requir|ing a writer's aid, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l even &s;upport him with its &s;plendor. The empire of the world ri&s;ing from the meane&s;t origin, and growing great by a &s;trict veneration for religion, and an implicit confidence in its commanders; continually chang|ing the mode, but &s;eldom the &s;pirit of

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE Commonwealth of Rome.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER I. Of the original of the Romans.</HEAD>
<P>THE Romans were particularly de&s;irous of be|ing thought de&s;cended from the gods, as if to hide the meanne&s;s of their real ance&s;try. Aeneas, the &s;on of Venus and Anchi&s;es, having e&s;caped from the de&s;truc|tion of Troy, after many adventures and dangers, arrived in Italy <MILESTONE UNIT="A.M." N="2294" REND="inBrackets"> where he was kindly re|ceived by Latinus, king of the Latins, who gave him his daughter Lavinia in marriage. Turnus, king of the Rutuli, was the fir&s;t who oppo&s;ed Aeneas, he having long made preten&s;ions to Lavinia him&s;elf. A war en&s;ued, in which the Trojan hero was victo|rious and Turnus &s;lain. In con&s;equence of this,
<PB N="2" REF="13">
Aeneas built a city, which was called Lavinium, in honour of his wife; and &s;ome time after, engaging in another war again&s;t Mezentius, one of the petty kings of the country, he was vanqui&s;hed in turn, and died in battle, after a reign of four years.</P>
<P>Numitor, the fifteenth king in a direct line from Aeneas, who took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the kingdom in con|&s;equence of his father's will, had a brother, named Amulius, to whom were left the trea&s;ures which had been brought from Troy. As riches but too gene|rally prevail again&s;t right, Amu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ius made u&s;e of his wealth to &s;upplant his brother, and &s;oon found means to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of the kingdom. Not content with the crime of u&s;urpation, he added that of mur|der al&s;o. Numitor's &s;ons fir&s;t fell a &s;acrifice to his &s;u&s;picions; and to remove all apprehen&s;ions of being one day di&s;turbed in is ill got power, he cau&s;ed Rhea Silvia, his brother's only daughter, to become a ve&s;|tal virgin; which office obliging her to perpetual ce|libacy, made him le&s;s unea&s;y as to the claims of po&s;|terity.</P>
<P>His precautions, however, were all fru&s;trated in the event; for Rhea Sylvia going to fetch water from a neighbouring grove, was met and ravi&s;hed by a man, whom, perhaps to palliate her offence, &s;he averred to be Mars, the god of war. From this con|gre&s;s, &s;he was brought to bed of two boys, who were no &s;ooner born, than devoted, by the u&s;urper to de&s;truction. The mother was condemned to be buried alive, the u&s;ual puni&s;hment for ve&s;tals who had violated their cha&s;tity, and the twins were or|dered to be flung into the river Tyber. It happened, at the time this rigorous &s;entence was put into exe|cution, that the river had more than u&s;ually over|flowed its banks, &s;o that the place where the children were thrown being at a di&s;tance from the main cur|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent, the water was too &s;hallow to drown them. In this &s;ituation, therefore, they continued without harm
<PB N="3" REF="14">
and, that no part of their pre&s;ervation might want its wonders, we are told, that they were for &s;ome time &s;uckled by a wolf, until Fau&s;tulus, the king's herd&s;man, finding them thus ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;ed, brought them home to Acca Laurentia, his wife, who brought them up as his own.</P>
<P>Romulus and Remus, the twins thus &s;trangely pre|&s;erved, &s;eemed early to di&s;cover abilities and de&s;ires above the meanne&s;s of their &s;uppo&s;ed original. The &s;hepherd's life began to di&s;plea&s;e them; and, from tending flocks, or hunting wild bea&s;ts, they &s;oon turned their &s;trength again&s;t the robbers round the country, whom they often &s;tript of their plunder, to &s;hare it among their fellow &s;hepherds. In one of the&s;e excur&s;ions, Remus was taken pri&s;oner by Nu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">tor's herd&s;man, who brought him before the king, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> accu&s;ed of being a plunderer.

<P>Numitor being thus in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">gdom, his grand&s;ons re&s;olved to build a city upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;e hills where they had formerly lived as &s;hep|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.

it&s;elf victorious; the one having the fir&s;t omen, the other the mo&s;t complete. This produced a conte&s;t, which ended in a battle wherein Remus was &s;lain; and it is even &s;aid, that he was killed by his brother; who, being provoked at his leaping contemptuou&s;ly over the city wall, &s;truck him dead upon the &s;pot.</P>
<P>Romulus, being now &s;ole commander, and eigh|teen years of age, began the foundation of a city that was one day to give laws to the world. It was called Rome, after the name of the &s;ounder, and built upon the Palatine hill, on which he had taken his &s;ucce&s;sful omen <MILESTONE UNIT="A.M." N=" 3252"> <MILESTONE UNIT="ante c" N="752" REND="inBrackets"> The city was at fir&s;t almo&s;t &s;quare, containing about a thou&s;and hou&s;es. It was near a mile in compa&s;s, and commanded a &s;mall territory round it of about eight miles ever. However &s;mall as it appears, it was, notwith&s;tanding, wor&s;e inhabited; and the fir&s;t method made u&s;e of to increa&s;e its numbers, was the opening a &s;anctuary for all malefactors, &s;laves, and &s;uch as were de&s;irous of novelty, and the&s;e came in great multitudes, and contributed to increa&s;e the number of our legi&s;lator's new &s;ubjects.</P>

<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. From the building of Rome to the death of Romulus.</HEAD>
<P>SCARCE was the city rai&s;ed above its founda|tion, when its rude inhabitants began to think of giving &s;ome form to their con&s;tifution. Romulus, by an act of great genero&s;ity, left them at liberty to chu&s;e whom they would for their king; and they, in gratitude, concurred to elect their founder; he was accordingly acknowledged as chief of their religion, &s;overeign magi&s;trate of Rome, and general of the army. Be&s;ide a guard to attend his per&s;on, it was
<PB N="5" REF="16" MS="y">
agreed that he &s;hould be precede wherever he went by twelve men, armed with axes tied up in a bundle of rods, who were to &s;erve as executioners of the law, and to impre&s;s his new &s;ubjects with an idea of his authority.</P>
<P>The &s;enate, which was to act as coun&s;ellors to the king, was compo&s;ed of an hundred of the principal citizens of Rome, con&s;i&s;ting of men who&s;e age, wi&s;dom, or valour, gave them a natural authority over their fellow-&s;ubjects, and the king named the fir&s;t &s;enator, and appointed him to the government of the city, whenever war required his own ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>The plebeians, who compo&s;ed the third part of the legi&s;lature, a&s;&s;umed to them&s;elves the power of authorizing tho&s;e laws which were pa&s;&s;ed by the king or the &s;enate. All things relative to peace or war, to the election of magi&s;trates, and even to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;ing a king, were confirmed by &s;uffrages in their a&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t care of the new-created king, was to attend to the intere&s;ts of religion, but the preci&s;e form of their wor&s;hip is unknown. The greate&s;t part of the religion of that age con&s;i&s;ted in a firm reliance upon the credit of their &s;ooth&s;ayers, who pretended, from ob&s;ervations on the flight of birds and the entrails of bea&s;ts, to direct the pre&s;ent, and to dive into futurity. Romulus, by an expre&s;s law, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ended, that no election &s;hould be made, no enterprize undertaken, without fir&s;t con&s;ulting them.</P>
<P>Wives were forbid, upon any pretext what&s;oever, to &s;eparate from their hu&s;bands; while, on the contra|ry, the hu&s;band was empowered to repudiate the wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, and even in &s;ome ca&s;es to put her to death. His laws between children and their parents were yet &s;till more &s;evere; the father had entire power over his offspring, both of fortune and life; he could &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> them or impri&s;on them at any time of their lives, or in any &s;tations to which they were arrived.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="17">After his endeavours by laws to regulate his &s;ub|jects, he next gave orders to a&s;certain their numbers. The whole amounted but to three thou&s;and foot, and about as many hundred hor&s;emen, capable of bearing arms. The&s;e therefore were divided equally into three tribes, and to each he a&s;&s;igned a different part of the city. Each of the&s;e tribes were &s;ubdivided into ten curiae, or companies, con&s;i&s;ting of an hundred men each, with a centurion to command it; a prie&s;t, call|ed curio, to perform the &s;acrifices; and two of the principle inhabitants, called duumviri, to di&s;tribute ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>By the&s;e wi&s;e regulations each day added &s;trength to the new city; multitudes flocked in from all the adjacent towns, and it only &s;eemed to want women to a&s;certain its duration. In this exigence, Romulus, by the advice of the &s;enate, &s;ent deputies among the Sabines his neighbours, entreating their alliance, and upon the&s;e terms offering to cement the mo&s;t &s;trict confederacy with them. The Sabines, who were then con&s;idered as the mo&s;t warlike people of Italy, rejected the propo&s;al with di&s;dain; Romulus therefore proclaimed a fea&s;t in honour of Neptune, throughout all the neighbouring villages, and made the mo&s;t magnificent preparations for it. The&s;e fea&s;ts were generally preceded by &s;acrifices, and ended in &s;hews of wre&s;tlers, gladiators, and chariot-cour&s;es. The Sabines, as he had expected, were among the foremo&s;t who came to be &s;pectators, bringing their wives and daughters with them to &s;hare the plea&s;ure of the &s;ight. In the mean time the games began, and, while the &s;trangers were mo&s;t intent upon the &s;pectacle, a number of the Roman youth ru&s;hed in among them with drawn &s;words, &s;eized the younge&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful women, and carried them off by violence. In vain the parents prote&s;ted again&s;t this breach of ho&s;pitality; in vain the virgins them&s;elves at fir&s;t oppo&s;ed the attempts of their ravi&s;hers; per|&s;everance
<PB N="7" REF="18">
and care&s;&s;es obtained tho&s;e favours which timidity at fir&s;t denied; &s;o that the betrayers, from being objects of aver&s;ion, &s;oon became the partners of their deare&s;t affections.</P>
<P>A bloody war en&s;ued. The cities of Cenina, An|temna and Cru&s;tumium were the fir&s;t who re&s;olved to revenge the common cau&s;e, which the Sabines &s;eemed too dilatory in pur&s;uing. But all the&s;e, by making &s;eparate inroads, became a more ea&s;y con|que&s;t to Romulus, who made the mo&s;t merciful u&s;e of his victory; in&s;tead of de&s;troying their towns, or le&s;&s;ening their numbers, he only placed colonies of Romans in them, to &s;erve as a frontier to repre&s;s more di&s;tant inva&s;ions.</P>
<P>Tatius, king of Cures, a Sabine city, was the la&s;t, although the mo&s;t formidable, who undertook to re|venge the di&s;grace his country had &s;uffered. He en|tered the Roman territories at the head of twenty|five thou&s;and men, and, not content with a &s;uperi|ority of forces, he added &s;tratagem al&s;o. Tarpiea, who was daughter to the commander of the Capito|l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne hill, happened to fall into his hands, as &s;he went without the walls of the city to fetch water. Upon her he prevailed, by means of large promi&s;es, to be|tray one of the gates to his army.

<P>AFTER an interregnum, as in the former ca&s;e, Ancus Martius, the grand&s;on of Numa, was elected king by the people, and the choice afterwards was confirmed by the &s;enate. As this monarch was a li|neal de&s;cendant from Numa, &s;o he &s;eemed to make him the great object of his imitation. He in&s;tituted the &s;acred ceremonies which were to precede a decla|ration of war; he took every occa&s;ion to advi&s;e his &s;ubjects to return to the arts of agriculture, and to lay a&s;ide the le&s;s u&s;eful &s;tratagems of war.</P>
<P>The&s;e in&s;titutions and precepts were con&s;idered by the neighbouring powers rather as marks of cowar|dice than of wi&s;dom.

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. From the death of Ancus Martius to the death of Tarquinius Pri&s;cus, the fifth king of Rome.  <MILESTONE REND="inBrackets" UNIT="U.C." N="138"> </HEAD>
<P>LUCIUS Tarquinius Pri&s;cus, who&s;e original name was Lucumon, and who was appointed guar|dian to the &s;ons of the late king, took the &s;urname of Tarquinius, from the city of Tarquinia, from whence he la&s;t came. His father was a merchant of Corinth, who had acquired con&s;iderable wealth by trade, and had &s;ettled in Italy upon account of &s;ome troubles at home. His &s;on Lucumon, who in|herited his fortune, married a woman of family in the city of Tarquinia; and, as his birth, profe&s;&s;ion, and country were contemptible to the nobles of the place, by his wife's per&s;ua&s;ions he came to &s;ettle at Rome, where merit only made di&s;tinction. On his way thither, &s;ay the hi&s;torians, as he approached the city gate, an eagle, &s;tooping from above, took off his hat, and flying round his chariot for &s;ome time, with much noi&s;e, put it on again. This, his wife Tanaquil, who it &s;eems was &s;killed in augury, in|terpreted as a pre&s;age, that he &s;hould one day wear the crown, and perhaps it was this which fir&s;t fired his ambition to pur&s;ue it.</P>
<P>Ancus being dead, and the kingdom, as u&s;ual, devolving upon the &s;enate, Tarquin u&s;ed all his power and arts to &s;et a&s;ide the children of the late king, and to get him&s;elf elected in their &s;tead. For this purpo&s;e, upon the day appointed for election, he contrived to have them &s;ent out of the city; and in
<PB N="15" REF="26">
a &s;et &s;peech to the people, in which he urged his friend&s;hip for them, the fortune he had &s;pent among them, and his knowledge of their government, he offered him&s;elf for their king. As there was nothing in this harangue that could be conte&s;ted, it had the de&s;ired effect, and the people, with one con&s;ent, elected him as their &s;overeign.</P>
<P>A kingdom thus got by intrigue, was notwith|&s;tanding governed with equity. In the beginning of his reign, in order to recompence his friends, he added an hundred members more to the &s;enate, which made them, in all, three hundred.</P>
<P>But his peaceful endeavours were &s;oon interrupted by the inroads of his re&s;tle&s;s neighbours, particularly the Latins, over whom he triumphed, and whom he forced to beg a peace. He then turned his arms again&s;t the Sabines, who had ri&s;en once more, and had pa&s;&s;ed over the river Tyber; but Tarquin attacking them with vigour routed their army; &s;o that many who e&s;caped the &s;word, were drowned in attempting to cro&s;s over, while their bodies and ar|mour floating down to Rome, brought news of the victory, even before the me&s;&s;engers could arrive that were &s;ent with the tidings. The&s;e conque&s;ts were follower by &s;everal advantages over the Latins, from whom he took many towns, though without gaining any deci&s;ive victory.</P>
<P>Tarquin, having thus forced his enemies into &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, was re&s;olved not to let his &s;ubjects corrupt in indolence, but undertook and perfected &s;everal public works for the convenience and embelli&s;hment of the city.</P>
<P>In his time al&s;o, the augurs came into a great increa&s;e of reputation, and he found it his intere&s;t to pro|mote the &s;uper&s;tition of the peple, as this was in fact but to increa&s;e their obedience. Tanaquil, his wife, was a great pretender to this art; but Accius Naevius was the mo&s;t celebrated adept of the kind, that was
<PB N="16" REF="27">
ever known in Rome. Upon a certain occa&s;ion, Tarquin being re&s;olved to try the augur's &s;kill, a&s;ked him, whether what he was then pondering in his mind could be effected. Naevius having examined his auguries, bold affirmed that it might: "Why then," cries the king, with an in&s;ulting &s;mile, "I had thoughts of cutting this whet&s;tone with a razor." "Cut boldly," replied the augur; and the king cut it through accordingly. Thence forward nothing was undertaken in Rome without con&s;ulting the au|gurs, and obtaining their advice and approbation.</P>
<P>Tarquin was not content with a kingdom without al&s;o the en&s;igns of royalty; in imitation of the Ly|dian kings, he a&s;&s;umed a crown of gold, an ivory throne, a &s;ceptre with an eagle on the top, and robes of purple. It was, perhaps, the &s;plendor of the&s;e royalties that fir&s;t rai&s;ed the envy of the late king's &s;ons, who had now for above thirty-&s;even years quiet|ly &s;ubmitted to his government. His de&s;ign al&s;o of adopting Servius Tullius, his &s;on-in-law, for his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, might have contributed to inflame their re|&s;entment. Whatever was the cau&s;e of their tardy vengeance, they re&s;olved to de&s;troy him; and at la&s;t found means to effect their purpo&s;e, by hiring two ruffians, who, demanding to &s;peak with the king, pre|tending that they came for ju&s;tice, &s;truck him dead in his palace with the blow of an ax. The lictors, however, who waited upon the per&s;on of the king, &s;eized the murderers, who were attempting to e&s;cape; they were put to death; but the &s;ons of Ancus, who were the in&s;tigators, found &s;afety by flight.</P>
<P>Thus fell Lucius Tarquinius, &s;urnamed Pri&s;cus, to di&s;tingui&s;h him from one of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of the &s;ame name, aged fifty-&s;ix years, of which he had reigned thirty-eight.</P>

<P>THE report of the murder of Tarquin filled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his &s;ubjects with complaint and indignation, while the citizens ran from every quarter to the palace, to learn the truth of the account, or to take vengeance on the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. In this tumult, Tanaquil, widow of the late king, con&s;idering the danger &s;he mu&s;t in|cur, in ca&s;e the con&s;pirators &s;hould &s;ucceed to the crown; and de&s;irous of having her &s;on-in-law for his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, with great art di&s;&s;embled her &s;orrow as well as the king's death. She a&s;&s;ured the people, from one of the windows of the palace, that he was not killed, but &s;tunned by the blow; that he would &s;hortly recover; and that, in the mean time, he had deputed his power to Servius Tullius, his &s;on-in-law. Servius, accordingly, as it had been agreed upon be|tween them, i&s;&s;ued from the palace, adorned with the en&s;igns of royalty, and preceded by his lictors, and went to di&s;patch &s;ome affairs that related to the public &s;afety; &s;till pretending, that he took all his in&s;tructions from the king. This &s;cene of di&s;&s;imu|lation continued for &s;ome days, till he had made his party good among the nobles; when the death of Tarquin being publicly a&s;certained, Servius came to the crown, &s;olely at the &s;enate's appointment, and without attempting to gain the &s;uffrages of the peo|ple.</P>
<P>Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vius was the &s;on of a bondwoman, who had been taken at the &s;acking of a town belonging to the Latins, and was born whil&s;t his mother was a &s;lave. While yet an infant in his cradle, a lambent flame

<P>Upon being acknowledged as king, the chief object of his reign was to increa&s;e the power of the &s;enate, by depre&s;&s;ing that of the people. The populace, who were unable to &s;ee into his de&s;igns, conferred upon him a full power of &s;ettling the taxes as he &s;hould think proper. And accordingly, as he in&s;i&s;ted that they &s;hould pay their taxes by centuries, he commanded that they &s;hould give their votes, in all public tran&s;|actions, by centuries al&s;o. In former deliberations each citizen gave his &s;uffrage &s;ingly, and the num|bers of the poor always carried it again&s;t the power of the rich; but by the regulations of Servius, the &s;enate was made to con&s;i&s;t of a greater number of centuries than all the other cla&s;&s;es put together, and thus entirely out-weighed them in every contention.</P>
<P>In order to a&s;certain the encrea&s;e or decay of his &s;ubjects and their fortunes, he in&s;tituted another re|gulation which he called a lu&s;trum. By this all the citizens were to a&s;&s;emble in the Campus Martius, in complete armour, and in their re&s;pective cla&s;&s;es, once in five years, and there to give an exact account of their families and fortune.</P>
<P>Having thus enjoyed a long reign, &s;pent in &s;ettling the dome&s;tic policy of the &s;tate, and al&s;o not inat+tentive to foreign concerns, he conceived rea&s;onable hopes of concluding it with tranquility and ea&s;e. He had even thoughts of laying down his power, and, having formed the kingdom into a republic, to retire into ob&s;curity; but &s;o generous a de&s;ign was fru&s;|trated ere it could be put into execution.</P>
<P>In the beginning of his reign, to &s;ecure his throne by every precaution, he had married his two daugh|ters to the two grand&s;ons of Tarquin; and as he knew that the women were of oppo&s;ite di&s;po&s;itions, as well as their intended hu&s;b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nds, be re&s;olved to cro&s;s their tempers, by giving them to him of a con|trary

turn of temper; her that was meek and gentle, to him that was bold and furious; her that was un|governable and proud, to him that was remarkable for a contrary character: by this he &s;uppo&s;ed, that each would correct the failings of the other, and that the mixture would be productive only of con|cord. The event however proved otherwi&s;e. Lu|cius, his haughty &s;on in-law, &s;oon grew di&s;plea&s;ed with the meekne&s;s of his con&s;ort, and placed his whole affections upon Tullia, his brother's wife, who an&s;wered his pa&s;&s;ion with &s;ympathetic ardour. As their wi&s;hes were ungovernable, they &s;oon re&s;olved to break through every re&s;traint that offered to pre|vent their union; both undertook to murder their con&s;orts, which they effected, and were accordingly &s;oon after married together. A fir&s;t crime ever pro|duces a &s;econd; from the de&s;truction of their con|&s;orts, they proceeded to con&s;piring that of the king. They began by rai&s;ing factions againct him, alledg|ing his illegal title to the crown, and Lucius by claiming it as his own, as heir to Tarquin. At length, when he found the &s;enate ripe for &s;econding his views, he entered the &s;enate-hou&s;e, adorned with all the en&s;igns of royalty, and placing him&s;elf upon the throne, began to harangue them upon the ob&s;curity of the king's birth, and the inju&s;tice of his title. While he was yet &s;peaking, Servius entered, attended by a few followers, and &s;eeing his throne thus rudely invaded, offered to pu&s;h the u&s;urper from his &s;eat; but Tarquin being in the vigour of youth, threw the old man down the &s;teps which led to the throne; and &s;ome of his adherents, being in&s;tructed for that pur|po&s;e, followed the king, as he was feebly attempting to get to the palace, and di&s;patched him by the way, throwing his body, all mangled and bleeding, as a public &s;pectacle into the &s;treet. In the mean time, Tullia, burning with impatience for the event, was
<PB N="20" REF="31">
informed of what her hu&s;band had done, and re&s;olv|ing to be among the fir&s;t who &s;hould &s;alute him as monarch, ordered her chariot to the &s;enate-hou&s;e. But as her charioteer approached the place where the old king her father's body lay expo&s;ed and bloody, the man, all amazed at the inhuman &s;pectacle, and not willing to trample upon it with his hor&s;es offered to turn another way; this only &s;erved to encrea&s;e the fiercene&s;s of her anger; &s;he threw the foot&s;tool at his head, and ordered him to drive over the dead body without he&s;itation.</P>
<P>This was the end of Servius Tullius, a prince of eminent ju&s;tice and moderation, after an u&s;eful and pro&s;perous reign of forty-four years.</P>

<P>LUCIUS Tarquinius, afterwards called Super|bus, or the Proud, having placed him&s;elf upon the throne, in con&s;equence of this violent attempt, was re&s;olved to &s;upport his dignity with the &s;ame violence with which it was acquired. Regardle&s;s of the &s;e|nate or the people's approbation, he &s;eemed to claim the crown by an hereditary right, and refu&s;ed the late king's body burial, under pretence of his being an u&s;urper. All the good part of mankind, how|ever, looked upon his acce&s;&s;ion with dete&s;tation and horror; and this act of inefficient cruelty only &s;erved to confirm their hatred. Con&s;cious of this, he or|dered all &s;uch as be &s;u&s;pected to have been attached to Servius, to be put to death; and fearing the natural con&s;equences of his tyranny, he encrea&s;ed the guard round his per&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="32">His chief policy &s;eems to have been to keep the people always employed either in wars or public works, by which means he diverted their attention from his unlawful method of coming to the crown. He fir&s;t marched again&s;t the Sabines, who refu&s;ed to pay him obedience, and &s;oon reduced them to &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion. He next began a war with the Vol&s;ci, which continued for &s;ome ages after. The city of the Gabii gave him much more trouble; for having attempted with &s;ome lo&s;s, to be&s;iege it, he was oblig|ed to direct his efforts by &s;tratagem, contrary to the u&s;ual practice of the Romans. He cau&s;ed his &s;on Sextus to counterfeit de&s;ertion, upon pretence of bar|barous u&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, and to &s;eek refuge among the inhabi|tants of the place. There, by artful complaints and &s;tudied lamentations, he &s;o prevailed upon the pity of the people, as to be cho&s;en their governor, and &s;oon after general of their army. At fir&s;t, in every engagement, he appeared &s;ucce&s;sful, till at length, finding him&s;elf entirely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the confidence of the &s;tate, he &s;ent a tru&s;ty me&s;&s;enger to his father for in&s;tructions. Parquin made no other an&s;wer than by taking the me&s;&s;enger into the garden, where he cut down before him the talle&s;t poppies. Sextus readily under&s;tood the meaning of this reply, and, one by one, found means to de&s;troy or remove the principal men of the city, &s;till taking care to confi&s;cate their effects among the people. The charms of this divi|dend kept the giddy populace blind to their approach|ing ruin, till they found them&s;elves, at la&s;t, without coun&s;ellors or head; and in the end, fell under the power of Tarquin, without even &s;triking a blow. After this, he made a league with the Aequi, and renewed that with the Etrurians.</P>
<P>But while he was engaged in wars abroad, he took care not to &s;uffer the people to continue in idlene&s;s at home. He undertook to build the capitol, the foun|dation of which had been laid in a former reign,
<PB N="22" REF="33">
and an extraordinary event contributed to ha&s;ten the execution of his de&s;ign. A woman, in &s;trange at|tire, made her appearance at Rome, and came to the king, offering to &s;ell nine books, which &s;he &s;aid were of her own compo&s;ing. Not knowing the abilities of the &s;eller, or that &s;he was, in fact, one of the celebrated &s;ybils, who&s;e prophecies were never found to fail, Tarquin refu&s;ed to buy them. Upon this &s;he departed, and burning three of her books, returned again, demanding the &s;ame price for the &s;ix remaining. Being once more de&s;pi&s;ed as an im|po&s;tor, &s;he again departed, and burning three more, &s;he returned with tho&s;e remaining, &s;till a&s;king the &s;ame price as at fir&s;t. Tarquin, &s;urpri&s;ed at the incon&s;i&s;tency of her behaviour, con&s;ulted the augurs, to advi&s;e him what to do. The&s;e much blamed him for not buying the nine, and commanded him to buy the three remaining, at what&s;oever price they were to be had. The woman, &s;ays the hi&s;torian, after thus &s;elling and delivering the three prophetic volumes, and advi&s;ing him to have a &s;pecial attention to what they contained, vani&s;hed from before him, and was never &s;een after. Upon this he cho&s;e pro|per per&s;ons to keep them, who, though but two at fir&s;t, were afterwards encrea&s;ed to fifteen, under the name of quindecemviri. They were put into a &s;tone che&s;t, and a vault in the newly-de&s;igned building was thought the propere&s;t place to lodge them in &s;afety. The people having been now for four years together employed in building the capitol, began, at la&s;t, to wi&s;h for &s;omething new to engage them; wherefore Tarquin, to &s;atisfy their wi&s;hes, proclaim|ed war again&s;t the Rutuli, upon a frivolous pretence of their having entertained &s;ome malefactors whom he had bani&s;hed, and inve&s;ted their chief city Ardea, which lay about &s;ixteen miles from Rome. While the army was encamped before this place, the king's &s;on Sextus, with Collatinus a noble Roman, and
<PB N="23" REF="34">
&s;ome others, &s;at in a tent drinking together: the di&s;|cour&s;e happening to turn upon the beauty and virtue of their wives, each man prai&s;ing his own, Collati|nus offered to decide the di&s;pute, by putting it to an immediate trial, who&s;e wife &s;hould be found po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the greate&s;t beauty, and mo&s;t &s;edulou&s;ly employed at that very hour. Being heated with wine, the pro|po&s;al was reli&s;hed by the whole company; and tak|ing hor&s;e without delay, they po&s;ted to Rome, tho' the night was already pretty far advanced. There they found Lucretia, the wife of Collatinus, not like the other women of her age, &s;pending the time in ea&s;e and luxury, but &s;pinning in the mid&s;t of her maids, and chearfully portioning out their ta&s;ks. Her mode&s;t beauty, and the ea&s;y reception &s;he gave her hu&s;band and his friends, &s;o charmed them all, that they unanimou&s;ly gave her the preference; and Sextus was &s;o much inflamed, that nothing but enjoy|ment could &s;atisfy his pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>For that purpo&s;e he went from the camp to vi&s;it her privately a few days after, and received the &s;ame kind reception which he had met with before. As his intentions were not &s;u&s;pected, Lucretia &s;ate with him at &s;upper, and ordered a chamber to be got ready for him in the hou&s;e. Midnight was the time in which this ruffian thought it &s;afe&s;t to put his de&s;igns in execution. Having found means to convey him|&s;elf into her chamber, he approached her bed-&s;ide with a drawn &s;word, and rudely laying his hand up|on her bo&s;om, threatened her with in&s;tant death if &s;he offered to re&s;i&s;t his pa&s;&s;ion. Lucretia affrighted out of her &s;leep, and &s;eeing death &s;o near, was yet inexorable to his de&s;ire, till being told, that, if &s;he would not yield, he would fir&s;t kill her, and then laying his own &s;lave al&s;o lead by her &s;ide, he would report, that he had found and killed them both, in the act of adultery. The terror of infamy atchieved what that of death could not obtain; &s;he con&s;ented
<PB N="24" REF="35">
to his de&s;ire, and the next morning he returned to the camp, exulting in his brutal victory. In the mean time, Lucretia, dete&s;ting the light, and re|&s;olving not to pardon her&s;elf for the crime of another, &s;ent for her hu&s;band Collatinus, and for Spurius, her father, to come to her, as an indelible di&s;grace had befallen the family. The&s;e in&s;tantly obeyed the &s;ummons, bringing with them Valerius, a kin&s;man of her father's, and Junius Brutus, a reputed idiot, who&s;e father Tarquin had murthered, and who had accidentally met the me&s;&s;enger by the way. Their arrival only &s;erved to encrea&s;e Lucretia's poignant angui&s;h; they found her in a &s;tate of &s;tedfa&s;t de&s;pe|ration, and vainly attempted to give her relief. <Q>No (&s;aid &s;he) never &s;hall I find any thing worth living for in this life, after having lo&s;t my honour. You &s;ee, my Collatinus, a polluted wretch before you; one who&s;e per&s;on has been the &s;poil of another, but who&s;e affections were never e&s;tranged from you. Sextus, under the pretended veil of friend|&s;hip, has this night forced from me that trea&s;ure which death only can re&s;tore; but if you have the hearts of men, remember to avenge my cau&s;e, and let po&s;terity know, that &s;he who has lo&s;t her virtue, hath only death for her be&s;t con&s;olation.</Q> So &s;aying, &s;he drew a poignard from beneath her robe&punc; and in&s;tantly plunging it into her bo&s;om, expired without a groan. The whole company remained for &s;ome time fixed in &s;orrow, pity, and indignation; Spurius and Collatinus, at length gave a vent to their grief in tears; but Brutus drawing the poignard reek|ing from Lucretia's wound, and lifting it up towards Heaven, "Be witne&s;s, ye Gods," he cried, <Q>that from this moment I proclaim my&s;elf the avenger of the cha&s;te Lucretia's cau&s;e: from this moment I pro|fe&s;s my&s;elf the enemy of Tarquin, and his lu&s;tful hou&s;e: from henceforth this life, while life continues, &s;hall be employed in oppo&s;ition to tyranny; and for
<PB N="25" REF="36">
the happine&s;s and freedom of my much loved coun|try.</Q> A new amazement &s;eized the hearers, to find him, whom they had hitherto con&s;idered as an ideot, now appearing in his real character, the friend of ju&s;tice, and of Rome. He told them, that tears and lamentations were unmanly, when vengeance called &s;o loud; and delivering the poignard to the re&s;t, impo&s;ed the &s;ame oath upon them which he him&s;elf had ju&s;t taken.</P>
<P>Junius Brutus was the &s;on of Marcus Junius, a noble Roman, who was married to the daughter of Tarquinius Pri&s;cus; and for that rea&s;on, through a motive of jealou&s;y, was put to death by Tarquin the Proud. This Junius Brutus had received an excel|lent education from his father, and had, from nature, &s;trong &s;en&s;e, and an inflexible attachment to virtue; but perceiving that Tarquin had privily murdered his father and his elde&s;t brother, he counterfeited him|&s;elf a fool, in order to e&s;cape the &s;ame danger, and thence obtained the &s;urname of Brutus. Tarquin thinking his folly real, de&s;pi&s;ed the man; and hav|ing po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of his e&s;tate, kept him as an ideot in his hou&s;e, merely with a view of making &s;port for his children.</P>
<P>Brutus, however, only waited this opportunity to avenge the cau&s;e of his family. Wherefore, order|ing Lucretia's dead body to be brought out to view, and expo&s;ed in the public forum, he enflamed the ardour of the citizens by a di&s;play of the horrid tran&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tion. He obtained a decree of the &s;enate, that Tarquin and his family &s;hould be for ever bani&s;hed from Rome, and that it &s;hould be capital for any to plead for, or attempt his future return. Thus this monarch, who had now reigned twenty-five years, being expelled his kingdom, went to take refuge with his family at Cira, a little city of Etruria. In the mean time, the Roman army made a truce with the

enemy, and Brutus was proclaimed, deliverer of the people.</P>

<P>THE regal power being overthrown, a form of government, nominally republican, was &s;ub&s;tituted in its room. The &s;enate, however, re&s;erved by far the greate&s;t &s;hare of the authority to them&s;elves, and decorated their own body with all the &s;poils of de|po&s;ed monarchy. The centuries of the people cho&s;e from among the &s;enators, in&s;tead of a king, two an|nual magi&s;trates, whom they called con&s;uls, with power equal to that of the regal, and with the &s;ame privileges and the &s;ame en&s;igns of authority.</P>
<P>Brutus, the deliverer of his country, and Colla|tinus, the hu&s;band of Lucretia, were cho&s;en fir&s;t con&s;uls in Rome.</P>
<P>But this new republic, however, which &s;eemed &s;o grateful to the people, had like to have been de&s;troy|ed in its very commencement. A party was formed in Rome in favour of Tarquin. Some young men of the principal families in the &s;tate, who had been educated about the king, and had &s;hared in all the luxuries and plea&s;ures of the court, undertook to re|e&s;tabli&s;h monarchy This party &s;ecretly encrea&s;e every day; and, what may create our &s;urprize, the &s;ons of Brutus him&s;elf, and the Aquilii, the nephews of Collatinus, were among the number Tarquin, who was informed of the&s;e intrigues in his favour, &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors from Etruria to Rome, under a pre|tence of reclaiming the crown; but in reality, with a de&s;ign to give &s;pirit to his faction. But the whole
<PB N="27" REF="38">
con&s;piracy was di&s;covered by a &s;lave who had acci|dentally hid him&s;elf in the room where the con&s;pira|tors u&s;ed to a&s;&s;emble. Few &s;ituations could have been more terribly affecting than that of Brutus, a father, placed as a judge upon the life and death of his own children; impelled by ju&s;tice to condemn, and by nature to &s;pare them. The young men accu&s;ed, pleaded nothing for them&s;elves; but, with con&s;cious guilt, awaited their &s;entence in &s;ilence and agony. The other judges, who were pre&s;ent, felt all the pangs of nature; Collatinus wept, and Valerius could not repre&s;s his &s;entiments of pity. Brutus, alone, &s;eemed to have lo&s;t all the &s;oftne&s;s of humani|ty, and, with a &s;tern countenance and a tone of voice that marked his gloomy re&s;olution, demanded of his &s;ons, if they could make any defence to the crimes with which they had been charged. This demand he made three &s;everal times; but receiving no an&s;wer, he, at length, turned him&s;elf to the executioner. "Now," cried he, "it is your part to perform the re&s;t."

<P><PB N="28" REF="39"> <MILESTONE UNIT="U.C." N="246"> The con&s;uls were not remi&s;s in prepara|tions to oppo&s;e him. Valerius commanded the foot, and Brutus being appointed to head the cavalry, went out to meet him on the Roman borders. Aruns, the &s;on of Tarquin, who com|manded the cavalry for his father, &s;eeing Brutus at a di&s;tance, was re&s;olved, by one great attempt, to de|cide the fate of the day before the engaging of the armies; wherefore &s;purring on his hor&s;e, he made towards him with ungovernable fury. Brutus, who perceived his approach, &s;ingled out from the ranks to meet him, and both met with &s;uch rage, that, eager only to a&s;&s;ail, and thoughtle&s;s of defending, they both fell dead upon the field together. A bloody battle en&s;ued, with equal &s;laughter on both &s;ides; but the Romans remaining in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the field of battle, claimed the victory; in con&s;equence, Valerius returned in triumph to Rome.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Tarquin, no way intimidated by his mi&s;fortunes, prevailed upon Por&s;enna, one of the kings of Etruria, to e&s;pou&s;e his cau&s;e, and in per&s;on undertake his quarrel. This prince, equally noted for courage and conduct, marched directly to Rome, with a numerous army, and laid &s;iege to the city, while the terror of his name and his arms filled all ranks of people with di&s;may. The &s;iege was car|ried on with vigour: a furious attack was made upon the place: the two con&s;uls oppo&s;ed in vain, and were carried off wounded from the field; while the Romans flying in great con&s;ternation, were pur&s;ued by the enemy to the bridge, over which, both victors and vanqui&s;hed were about to enter the city in the confu&s;ion. All now appeared lo&s;t and over, when Horatius Cocles, who had been placed there as cen|tinel to defend it, oppo&s;ed him&s;elf to the torrent of the enemy, and, a&s;&s;i&s;ted only by two more, for &s;ome time &s;u&s;tained the whole fury of the a&s;&s;ault, till the bridge was broken down behind him: when he

found the communication thus cut off, plunging with his arms into the torrent of the Tyber, he &s;wam back victorious to his fellow-&s;oldiers, and was re|ceived with ju&s;t applau&s;e.</P>
<P>Still, however, Por&s;enna was determined upon tak|ing the city; and, though five hundred of his men were &s;lain in a &s;ally of the Romans, he reduced it to the greate&s;t &s;traights, and turning the &s;iege into a blockade, re&s;olved to take it by famine. The di&s;tre&s;s of the be&s;ieged &s;oon began to be in&s;ufferable, and all things &s;eemed to threaten a &s;peedy &s;urrender, when another act of fierce bravery, &s;till &s;uperior to that which had &s;aved the city before, again procured its &s;afety and freedom.</P>
<P>Mutius, a youth of undaunted courage, was re|&s;olved to rid his country of an enemy, that &s;o &s;orely continued to oppre&s;s it; and for this purpo&s;e, di&s;|gui&s;ed in the habit of an Etrurian pea&s;ant, entered the camp of the enemy, re&s;olving to die or to kill the king. With this re&s;olution he made up to the place where Por&s;enna was paying his troops, with a &s;ecretary by his &s;ide; but mi&s;taking the latter for the king, he &s;tabbed him to the heart, and was imme|diately apprehended, and brought back into the royal pre&s;ence. Upon Por&s;enna's demanding who he was, and the cau&s;e of &s;o heinous an action, Mu|tius, without re&s;erve, informed him of his country and his de&s;ign, and at the &s;ame time thru&s;ting his right hand into a fire that was burning upon an altar before him, "You &s;ee," cried he, <Q>how little I regard the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hment your cruelty can inflict upon me.

The populace looked with terror upon a magi&s;trate whom they had inve&s;ted with uncontroulable power, and peaceably went each to range him&s;elf under his re&s;pec|tive &s;tandard.

wi&s;hed well to the army made all the attempts they could to &s;cale the walls, in order to join it. The &s;e|nate was not le&s;s agitated than the re&s;t: &s;ome were for violent mea&s;ures, and repelling force by force; others were of opinion, that gentler arts were to be u&s;ed, and that even a victory over &s;uch enemies, would be wor&s;e than a defeat. At length, therefore, it was re&s;olved to &s;end a me&s;&s;enger, entreating the army to return home and declare their grievances, promi&s;ing at the &s;ame time, an oblivion of all that had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>This me&s;&s;age not &s;ucceeding, Menenius Agrippa, one of the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of the &s;enators; was of opi|nion, that the people were to be complied with.</P>
<P>It was re&s;olved, therefore, to enter into a treaty with the people, and to make them &s;uch offers as &s;hould induce them to return. Ten commi&s;&s;ioners were accordingly deputed, at the head of whom were Largius and Valerius, who had been dictators, and Menenius Agrippa, equally loved by the &s;enate and the people. The dignity and the popularity of the&s;e amba&s;&s;adors procured them a very re&s;pectable recep|tion among the &s;oldiers, and a long conference be|gan between them. Largius and Valerius employed all their oratory on the one hand; while Sicinius and Lucius Junius, who were the &s;poke&s;men of the &s;oldiery, aggravated their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, with all that ma&s;culine eloquence which is the child of nature. The conference had now continued for a long time, when Menenius Agrippa, who had been originally a plebeian him&s;elf, a &s;hrewd man, and who, con&s;e|quently, knew what kind of eloquence was mo&s;t likely to plea&s;e the people, addre&s;&s;ed them with that celebrated fable, which is &s;o finely told us by Livy. "In times of old, when every part of the body could think for it&s;elf, and each had a &s;eparate will of its own, they all, with common con&s;ent, re&s;olved to revolt again&s;t the belly: they knew no rea&s;on, they &s;aid, why they &s;hould toil from morning till night in
<PB N="33" REF="44">
its &s;ervice, while the belly, in the mean time, lay at its ea&s;e in the mid&s;t of them all, and indolently grew fat upon their labours: accordingly, one and all, they agreed to befriend it no more. The feet vowed they would carry it no longer; the hands vowed they would feed it no longer; and the teeth averred they would not chew a mor&s;el of meat, though it were placed between them. Thus re&s;olved, they all, for &s;ome time, &s;hewed their &s;pirit, and kept their word; but &s;oon they found, that, in&s;tead of mortify|ing the belly by the&s;e means, they only undid them|&s;elves; they langui&s;hed for a while, and perceived, when too late, that it was owing to the belly, that they had &s;trength to work or courage to mutiny."</P>
<P>This fable, the application of which is obvious, had an in&s;tantaneous effect upon the people. They unanimou&s;ly cried out, that Agrippa &s;hould lead them back to Rome; and were making preparations to follow him, when Lucius Junius, before-men|tioned, with-held them; alledging, that, though they were gratefully to acknowledge the kind offers of the &s;enate, yet they had no &s;afe-guard for the fu|ture again&s;t their re&s;entment; that, therefore, it was nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ecurity of the people, to have cer|tain officers created annually from among them&s;elves, who &s;hould have power to give &s;uch of them as &s;hould be injured, redre&s;s, and plead the cau&s;e of the community.</P>
<P>The people, who are ever of opinion with the la&s;t &s;peaker, highly applauded this propo&s;al, which yet the commi&s;&s;ioners had not power to comply with; they, therefore, &s;ent to Rome to take the in&s;tructions of the &s;enate; who, worried with divi&s;ions among them&s;elves, and harra&s;&s;ed by complaints from with|out, were re&s;olved to have peace, at what&s;oever price it &s;hould be obtained; accordingly, as if with one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ce, they con&s;ented to the creation of their new <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lvers, who were called <HI>Tribunes of the People,</HI>

<P>The tribunes of the people were at fir&s;t five in number, though afterwards their body was encrea&s;ed by five more. They were always annually elected by the people, and almo&s;t always from their body.

<P>DURING the late &s;eparation, all tillage had been entirely neglected, and a famine was the con&s;e|quence the en&s;uing &s;ea&s;on. The &s;enate did all that lay in their power to remedy the di&s;tre&s;s; but the people, pinched with want, and willing to throw the blame on any but them&s;elves, a&s;cribed the whole of their di&s;tre&s;s, to the avarice of the patricians; who having purcha&s;ed all the corn, as was alledged, intended to indemnify them&s;elves for the abolition of debts, by &s;elling it out to great advantage. But abundance, &s;oon after, appea&s;ed them for a time. A large fleet of &s;hips laden with corn from Sicily (a
<PB N="35" REF="46">
great part of which was a pre&s;ent from Gelon, the king of that country, to the Romans, and the re&s;t purcha&s;ed by the &s;enate with the public money) rai&s;|ed their &s;pirits once more.</P>
<P>But Coriolanus incurred their re&s;entment, by in|&s;i&s;ting that it &s;hould not be di&s;tributed till the griev|ances of the &s;enate were removed. For this, the tri|bunes &s;ummoned him to a trial before the people.</P>
<P>When the appointed day was come, all per&s;ons were filled with the greate&s;t expectations, and a va&s;t concour&s;e from the adjacent country a&s;&s;embled and filled up the Forum. Coriolanus, upon this, pre&s;ent|ed him&s;elf before the people, with a degree of intre|pidity that merited better fortune. His graceful per|&s;on, his per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence, the cries of tho&s;e whom he had &s;aved from the enemy, inclined the auditors to relent. But, being unable to an&s;wer what was alledged again&s;t him to the &s;atisfaction of the people, and utterly confounded with a new charge, of having embezzled the plunder of Antium, the tribunes immediately took the votes, and Coriola|nus was condemned to perpetual ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le.</P>
<P>This &s;entence again&s;t their brave&s;t defender, &s;truck the whole body of the &s;enate with &s;orrow, con&s;terna|tion, and regret. Coriolanus alone, in the mid&s;t of the tumult, &s;eemed an unconcerned &s;pectator. He returned home, followed by the lamentations of hun|dreds of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable &s;enators and citizens of Rome, to take a la&s;ting leave of his wife, his chil|dren, and his mother Veturia. Thus recommend|ing his little children to their care, and all to the care of Heaven, he left the city, without followers or fortune, to take refuge with Tullus Attius, a man of great power among the Vol&s;cians, who took him under his protection, and e&s;pou&s;ed his quarrel.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing to be done, was to induce the Vol&s;ci to break the league which had been made with Rome; and for this purpo&s;e Tullus &s;ent many
<PB N="36" REF="47">
of his citizens thither, in order to &s;ee &s;ome games at that time celebrating; but in the mean time gave the &s;enate private information, that the &s;trangers had dangerous intentions of burning the city. This had the de&s;ired effect; the &s;enate i&s;&s;ued an order, that all &s;trangers, whoever they were, &s;hould depart from Rome before &s;un-&s;et. This order Tullus repre&s;ented to his countrymen, as an infraction of the treaty, and procured an emba&s;&s;y to Rome, complaining of the breach, and redemanding all the territories be|longing to the Vol&s;cians, of which they had been violently di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; declaring war in ca&s;e of a re|fu&s;al: but this me&s;&s;age was treated by the &s;enate with contempt.</P>
<P>War being thus declared on both &s;ides, Coriola|nus and Tullus were made generals of the Vol&s;cians, and accordingly invaded the Roman territories, ra|vaging and laying wa&s;te all &s;uch lands as belonged to the plebeians, but letting tho&s;e of the &s;enators re|main untouched. In the mean time, the levies went on but &s;lowly at Rome; the two con&s;uls, who were re-elected by the people, &s;eemed but little &s;killed in war, and even feared to encounter a gene|ral, whom they knew to be their &s;uperior in the field. The allies al&s;o &s;hewed their fears, and &s;lowly b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ought in their &s;uccours; &s;o that Coriolanus con|tinued to take their towns one after the other. For|tune followed him in every expedition, and he was now &s;o famous for his victories, that the Vol&s;ci left their towns de&s;encele&s;s, to follow him into the field. The v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry &s;oldiers of his colleague's army came over to him, and would acknowledge no other general. Thus find|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">g him&s;elf unoppo&s;ed in the field, and at the head of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">me us army, he at length inve&s;ted the city of Rome it&s;elf, fully re&s;olved to be&s;iege it. It was then that the &s;enate and the people unanimou&s;ly agreed to &s;end deputies to him with propo&s;als of re&s;toration, in ca&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he &s;hould draw off his army. Coriolanus re|ceived
<PB N="37" REF="48">
their propo&s;als at the head of his principal of|ficers, and, with the &s;ternne&s;s of a general that was to give the law, refu&s;ed their offers.</P>
<P>Another emba&s;&s;y was now &s;ent forth, conjuring him not to exact from his native city, aught but what became Romans to grant. Coriolanus, however, naturally inflexible and &s;evere, &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in his former demands, and granted them but three days, in which to fini&s;h their deliberations. In this exi|gence, all that was left, was another deputation &s;till more &s;olemn than either of the former, compo&s;ed of the pontiffs, the prie&s;ts, and the augurs. The&s;e, cloathed in their habits of ceremony, and with a grave and mournful deportment, i&s;&s;ued from the city, and entered the camp of the conqueror: but all in vain, they found him &s;evere and inflexible as before.</P>
<P>When the people &s;aw them return ineffectually, they began to give up the commonwealth as lo&s;t. Their temples were filled with old men, with women and children, who, pro&s;trate at their altars, put up their ardent prayers for the pre&s;ervation of their country. Nothing was to be heard but angui&s;h and lamentation, nothing to be &s;een but &s;cenes of affright and di&s;tre&s;s. At length, it was &s;ugge&s;ted to them, that what could not be effected by the interce&s;&s;ion of the &s;enate, or the adjuration of the prie&s;ts, might be brought about by the tears of his wife, or the com|mands of his mother. This deputation &s;eemed to be reli&s;hed by all, and even the &s;enate it&s;elf gave it the &s;anction of their authority. Veturia, the mother of Coriolanus, at fir&s;t made &s;ome he&s;itation to under|take &s;o pious a work, knowing the inflexible temper of her &s;on, and fearing only to &s;hew his di&s;obedience in a new point of light, by rejecting the commands of a parent: however, &s;he, at la&s;t undertook the em|ba&s;&s;y, and &s;et forward from the city, accompanied by many of the principal matrons of Rome, with
<PB N="38" REF="49">
Volumnia his wife, and his two children. Coriola|nus, who at a di&s;tance di&s;covered this mournful train of females, was re&s;olved to give them a denial, and called his officers round him, to be witne&s;&s;es of his re&s;olution: but, when told that his mother and his wife were among the number, he in&s;tantly came down from his tribunal, to meet and embrace them. At fir&s;t, the women's tears and embraces took away the power of words, and the rough &s;oldier him&s;elf, hard as he was, could not refrain from &s;haring in their di&s;tre&s;s. Coriolanus, now &s;eemed much agi|tated by contending pa&s;&s;ions; while his mother, who &s;aw him moved, &s;econded her words by the mo&s;t per|&s;ua&s;ive eloquence, her tears: his wife and children hung round him, entreating for protection and pity; while the fair train, her companions, added their la|mentations, and deplored their own and their coun|try's di&s;tre&s;s. Coriolanus, for a moment, was &s;ilent, feeling the &s;trong conflict between honour and incli|nation; at length, as if rouzed from his dream, he flew to take up his mother, who had fallen at his feet, crying out, <Q>O my mother, thou ha&s;t &s;aved Rome, but lo&s;t thy &s;on.</Q> He accordingly gave orders to draw off the army, pretending to the officers, that the city was too &s;trong to be taken. Tullus, who had long envied his glory, was not re|mi&s;s in aggravating the lenity of his conduct to his countrymen. Upon their return, Coriolanus was &s;lain in an in&s;urrection of the people, and afterwards honourably buried, with late and ineffectual re|pentance.</P>
<P>Great and many were the public rejoicings at Rome, upon the retreat of the Vol&s;cian army: but they were clouded &s;oon after by the intrigues of Spu|rius Ca&s;&s;ius, who wanting to make him&s;elf de&s;potic by means of the people, was found guilty of a num|ber of crimes, all tending towards altering the con|&s;titution, and was thrown head-long from the Tar|peian
<PB N="39" REF="50">
rock, by tho&s;e very people who&s;e intere&s;ts he had endeavoured to extend.</P>
<P>The year following, the two con&s;uls of the former year, Manlius and Fabius, were cited by the tri|bunes to appear before the people. The Agrarian law, which had been propo&s;ed &s;ome time before, for equally dividing the lands of the common|wealth among the people, was the object invariably pur&s;ued, and they were accu&s;ed of having made un|ju&s;tifiable delays in putting it off.</P>
<P>It &s;eems, the Agrarian law was a grant the &s;enate could not think of giving up to the people. The con&s;uls, therefore, made many delays and excu&s;es, till at length they were once more obliged to have re|cour&s;e to a dictator, and they fixed upon Quintus Cincinnatus, a man who had, for &s;ome time, given up all views of ambition, and retired to his little farm, where the deputies of the &s;enate found him holding the plow, and dre&s;&s;ed in the mean attire of a labouring hu&s;band-man. He appeared but little elevated with the addre&s;&s;es of ceremony, and the pom|pous habits they brought him; and, upon declaring to him the &s;enate's plea&s;ure, he te&s;tified rather a con|cern that his aid &s;hould be wanted: he naturally pre|ferred the charms of a country retirement, to the fa|tiguing &s;plendors of office, and only &s;aid to his wife, as they were leading him away, <Q>I fear, my At|tillia, that for this year, our little fields mu&s;t re|main un&s;own.</Q> Thus taking a tender leave, he departed for the city, where both parties were &s;trong|ly enflamed again&s;t each other. However, he was re&s;olved to &s;ide with neither; but, by a &s;trict atten|tion to the intere&s;ts of his country, in&s;tead of gaining the confidence of faction, to &s;eize the e&s;teem of all. Thus, by threats, and well-timed &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, he prevailed upon the tribunes to put off their law for a time, and carried him&s;elf &s;o as to be a terror to the multitude, whenever they refu&s;ed to enli&s;t; and
<PB N="40" REF="51">
their greate&s;t encourager whenever their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion de&s;erved it. Thus having re&s;tored that tranquility to the people, which he &s;o much loved him&s;elf, he again gave up the &s;plendors of ambition, to enjoy it with a greater reli&s;h in his little farm.</P>
<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="U.C." N="295"> Cincinnatus was not long retired from his office, when a fre&s;h exigence of the &s;tate once more required his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; the Aequi and the Vol&s;ci, who, though &s;till wor&s;ted, &s;till were for renewing the war, made new inroads into the ter|ritories of Rome. Minutius, one of the con&s;uls who &s;ucceeded Cincinnatus, was &s;ent to oppo&s;e them; but being naturally timid, and rather more afraid or being conquered than de&s;irous of victory, his army was driven into a defile between two mountains, from which, except through the enemy, there was no egre&s;s. This, however, the Aequi had the pre|caution to fortify, by which the Roman army was &s;o hemmed in on every &s;ide, that nothing remained but &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the enemy, famine, or immediate death. Some knights who found means of getting away privately through the enemy's camp, were the fir&s;t that brought the account of this di&s;a&s;ter to Rome. Nothing could exceed the con&s;ternation of all ranks of people when informed of it; the &s;enate, at fir&s;t, thought of the other con&s;ul; but not having &s;ufficient experience of his abilities, they unanimou&s;|ly turned their eyes upon Cincinnatus, and re&s;olved to make him dictator. Cincinnatus, the only per|&s;on on whom Rome could now place her whole de|pendence, was found, as before, by the me&s;&s;engers of the &s;enate, labouring in his little field, with chear|ful indu&s;try. He was at fir&s;t a&s;toni&s;hed at the en|&s;igns of unbounded power, with which the deputies came to inve&s;t him; but &s;till more at the approach of the principal of the &s;enate, who came out to meet him. A dignity &s;o unlooked for, however, had no effect upon the &s;implicity or the integrity of his man|ners:
<PB N="41" REF="52">
and being now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of ab&s;olute power, and called upon to nominate his ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e, he cho&s;e a poor man named Tarquitius, one who, like him&s;elf, de&s;pi&s;ed riches when they led to di&s;|honour. Thus the &s;aving a great nation was devolved upon an hu&s;bandman, taken from the plough, and an ob&s;cure centinel found among the dregs of the army. Upon entering the city, the dic|tator put on a &s;erene look, and entreated all tho&s;e who were able to bear arms, to repair before &s;un-&s;et to the Campus Martius (the place where the levies were made) with nece&s;&s;ary arms, and provi&s;ions for five days. He put him&s;elf at the head of the&s;e, and marching all night with great expedition, he arrived before day, within &s;ight of the enemy. Upon his approach, he ordered his &s;oldiers to rai&s;e a loud &s;hout, to apprize the con&s;ul's army of the relief that was at hand. The Aequi were not a little amazed, when they &s;aw them&s;elves between two enemies, but &s;till more when they perceived Cincinnatus making the &s;tronge&s;t entrenchments beyond them, to prevent their e&s;cape, and enclo&s;ing them as they had enclo&s;|ed the con&s;ul. To prevent this, a furious combat en&s;ued; but the Aequi being attacked on both &s;ides, and unable to re&s;i&s;t or fly, begged a ce&s;&s;ation of arms. They offered the dictator his own terms: he take them their lives; but obliged them, in token of &s;ervitude, to pa&s;s under the yoke, which was two &s;pears &s;et upright, and another acro&s;s in the form of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> callows, beneath which the vanqui&s;hed were to march.

The&s;e were his honours; yet, notwith&s;tanding all this, he had never received any &s;hare of tho&s;e lands which were won from the enemy; but continued to draw on a life of poverty and contempt, while others were po&s;|&s;e&s;t of tho&s;e very territories which his valour had won, without any merit to de&s;erve them, or ever having contributed to the conque&s;t. A ca&s;e of &s;o much hard&s;hip had a &s;trong effect upon the multi|tude; they unanimou&s;ly demanded, that the law might be pa&s;&s;ed, and that &s;uch merit &s;hould not go unrewarded.

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. From the creation of the Decemviri to the extinction of that office.  <MILESTONE REND="inBrackets" UNIT="U.C." N="302"> </HEAD>
<P>THE commonwealth of Rome had now for near &s;ixty years been fluctuating between the contending orders that compo&s;ed it, till at length, each &s;ide, as if weary, were willing to re&s;pire a while from the mutual exertions of their claims. The citizens, now, therefore, of every rank, began to complain of the arbitrary deci&s;ions of their magi&s;trates, and wi&s;h|ed to be guided by a written body of laws, which being known, might prevent wrongs as well as pu|ni&s;h them. In this, both the &s;enate and the people concurred, as hoping that &s;uch laws would put an end to the commotions that &s;o long had harra&s;&s;ed the &s;tate. It was thereupon agreed, that amba&s;&s;adors &s;hould be &s;ent to the Greek cities in Italy, and to Athens, to bring home &s;uch laws from thence, as by experience had been found mo&s;t equitable and u&s;eful. For this purpo&s;e, three &s;enators, Po&s;thumius, Sulpi|cius, and Manlius, were fixed upon, and gallies a&s;|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gned to convoy them, agreeable to the maje&s;ty of the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">man people. While they were upon this c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mmi&s;&s;ion abroad, a dreadful plague depopulated the city at Rome, and &s;upplied the interval of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> with other anxiety than that of wi&s;hes for
<PB N="44" REF="55">
their return. In about a year the plague cea&s;ed, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the amba&s;&s;adors returned, bringing home a body o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> laws, collected from the mo&s;t civilized &s;tates of Greece and Italy, which being afterwards formed in|to ten tables, and two more being added, made that celebrated code, called the laws of the Twelve Tables many fragments of which remain to this day.</P>
<P>The amba&s;&s;adors were no &s;ooner returned, than the tribunes required, that a body of men &s;hould be cho&s;en to dige&s;t their new laws into proper form, and to give weight to the execution of them. After long debates whether this choice &s;hould not be partly made from the people as well as the patricians, it was at la&s;t agreed that ten of the principal &s;enators &s;hould be elected, who&s;e power continuing for a year, &s;hould be equal to that of kings and con&s;uls, and that without any appeal. The per&s;ons cho&s;en were, Appius and Genutius, who had been elected con&s;uls for the en&s;uing year; Po&s;thumius, Sulpicius, and Manlius, the three amba&s;&s;adors; Sextus and Romu|lus, former con&s;uls; with Julius, Veturius, and Ho|ratius, &s;enators of the fir&s;t con&s;ideration. Thus the whole con&s;titution of the &s;tate at once took a new form, and a dreadful experiment was going to be tri|ed, of governing one nation, by laws formed from the manners and cu&s;toms of another.</P>
<P>The decemviri being now inve&s;ted with ab&s;olute power, agreed to take the reins of government by turns, and that each &s;hould di&s;pen&s;e ju&s;tice for a day.</P>
<P>The&s;e magi&s;trates, for the fir&s;t year, wrought with extreme application: and their work being fini&s;hed, it was expected that they would be contented to give up their offices; but having known the charms of power, they were now unwilling to re&s;ign it: they therefore pretended that &s;ome laws were yet wanting to complete their de&s;ign, and entreated the &s;enate for a continuance of their offices; to which that body a&s;&s;ented.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="56">But they &s;oon threw off the ma&s;k of moderation, and, regardle&s;s either of the approbation of the &s;enate or the people, re&s;olved to continue them&s;elves, again&s;t all order, in the decemvirate. A conduct &s;o notorious produced di&s;contents, and the&s;e were as &s;ure to produce fre&s;h acts of tyranny. The city was become almo&s;t a de&s;ert, with re&s;pect to all who had any thing to lo&s;e, and the decemvirs rapacity was then only di&s;continued, when they wanted fre&s;h ob|jects to exerci&s;e it upon. In this &s;tate of &s;lavery, pro|&s;cription, and mutual di&s;tru&s;t, not one citizen was found to &s;trike for his country's freedom; the&s;e tyrants continued to rule without control, being con&s;tantly guarded, not with their lictors alone, but a numerous c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">owd of dependents, clients, and even patricians, whom their vices had confederated round them.</P>
<P>In this gloomy &s;ituation of the &s;tate, the Aequi and Vol&s;ci, tho&s;e con&s;tant enemies of the Romans, un|dertook their incur&s;ions, re&s;olved to profit by the in|te&s;tine divi&s;ions of the people, and advanced within about ten miles of Rome.</P>
<P>But the decemviri being put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the military as well as of the civil power, divided their army into three parts; whereof one continued with Appius in the city, to keep it in awe; the other two were commanded by his colleagues, and were led, one again&s;t the Aequi, and the other again&s;t the Sa|bines. The Roman &s;oldiers had now got into a me|thod of puni&s;hing the generals whom they di&s;liked, by &s;uffering them&s;elves to be vanqui&s;hed in the field. They put it in practice upon this occa&s;ion, and &s;hamefully abandoned their camp upon the approach of the enemy. Never was the news of a victory more joyfully received at Rome, than the tidings of this defeat; the generals, as is always the ca&s;e, were blamed for the treachery of their men; &s;ome demand|ed that they &s;hould be depo&s;ed, others cried out for a dictator to lead the troops to conque&s;t; but among
<PB N="46" REF="57">
the re&s;t, old Siccius Dentatus, the tribune, &s;poke his &s;entiments with his u&s;ual openne&s;s; and treating the generals with contempt, &s;hewed all the faults of their di&s;cipline in the camp, and their conduct in the field. Appius, in the mean time, was not remi&s;s in ob&s;erving the di&s;po&s;ition of the people. Dentatus in particular was marked out for vengeance, and, under pretence of doing him particular honour, he was ap|pointed legate, and put at the head of the &s;upplies which were &s;ent from Rome, to reinforce the army. The office of legate was held &s;acred among the Ro|mans, as in it were united the authority of a general, with the reverence due to the prie&s;thood. Dentatus, no way &s;u&s;pecting his de&s;ign, went to the camp with alacrity, where he was received with all the external marks of re&s;pect. But the generals &s;oon found means of indulging their de&s;ire of revenge. He was ap|pointed at the head of an hundred men to go and exa|mine a more commodious place for encampment, as he had very candidly a&s;&s;ured the commanders, that their pre&s;ent &s;ituation was wrong. The &s;oldiers however, who were given as his attendants, were a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins; wretches who had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ong been mini&s;ters of the vengeance of the decemviri, and who now engag|ed to murder him, though with all tho&s;e apprehen|&s;ions, which his reputation, as he was called the Ro+man Achilles, might be &s;uppo&s;ed to in&s;pire. With the&s;e de&s;igns they led him fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m the way into the be|low bo&s;om of a retired mountain, where they began to &s;et upon him from behind. Dentatus now too late perceived the treachery of the decemviri, and was re&s;olved to fell his life as dearly as he could; he therefore put his back to a rock, and defended him|&s;elf again&s;t tho&s;e who pre&s;&s;ed mo&s;t clo&s;ely. Though now grown old, he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l the remains of his for|mer valour, and killed no le&s;s than fifteen of the a&s;|&s;ailants, and wounded thirty with his own hand. The a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins now therefore, terrified at his amazing
<PB N="47" REF="58">
bravery, &s;howered in their javelins upon him at a di&s;tance, all which he received in his &s;hield with undaunted re&s;olution. The combat, though &s;o un|equal in numbers, was managed for &s;ome time with doubtful &s;ucce&s;s, till at length his a&s;&s;ailants be|thought them&s;elves of a&s;cending the rock, again&s;t which he &s;tood, and thus poured down &s;tones upon him from above. This &s;ucceeded; the old &s;oldier fell beneath their united efforts, after having &s;hewn by his death, that he owed it to his fortitude, and not his fortune, that he had come off &s;o many times victorious. The decemviri pretended to join in the general &s;orrow for &s;o brave a man, and decreed him a funeral with the fir&s;t military honours: but the greatne&s;s of their apparent di&s;tre&s;s, compared with their known hatred, only rendered them &s;till more dete&s;table to the people.</P>
<P>But a tran&s;action &s;till more attrocious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">han the for|mer, &s;erved to in&s;pire the citizens with a re&s;olution to break a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l mea&s;ures of obedience, and at la&s;t to re&s;tore freedom Appius, who &s;till remained at Rome, fitting one day on his tribunal to di&s;pen&s;e ju&s;tice, &s;aw a maiden of exqui&s;ite beauty, and aged about fifteen, pa&s;&s;ing to one of the public &s;chools, attended by a matron, her n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;e. The charms of this dam&s;el, heightened by all the innocence of virgin mode&s;ty, caught his attention, and fired his heart. The day following, as &s;he pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, he found her &s;till more beautiful than be|f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re, and his brea&s;t &s;till more enflamed.

<PB N="48" REF="59">
her him&s;elf; but the laws of the Twelve Tables had forbidden the patricians to intermarry with the ple|beians, and he could not infringe the&s;e, as he was the enactor of them. Nothing therefore remained but a criminal enjoyment, which, as he was long u&s;ed to the indulgence of his pa&s;&s;ions, he re&s;olved to obtain. After having vainly tried to corrupt the fide|lity of her nur&s;e, he had recour&s;e to another expe|dient, &s;till more guilty. He pitched upon one Clau|dius, who had long been the mini&s;ter of his plea&s;ures, to a&s;&s;ert the beautiful maid was his &s;lave, and to refer the cau&s;e to his tribunal for deci&s;ion. Claudius be|haved exactly according to his in&s;tructions, for en|tering into the &s;chool, where Virginia was playing among her female companions, he &s;eized upon her as his property, and was going to drag her away by force, but was prevented by the people drawn to|gether by her cries. At length, after the fir&s;t heat of oppo&s;ition was over, he led the weeping virgin to the tribunal of Appius, and there plau&s;ibly expo&s;ed his preten&s;ions. He a&s;&s;erted that &s;he was born in his hou&s;e, of a female &s;lave, who &s;old her to the wife of Virginius, who had been barren. That he had &s;everal credible evidences to prove the truth of what he &s;aid; but that, until they could come to|gether, it was but rea&s;onable, the &s;lave &s;hould be delivered into his cu&s;tody, being her proper ma&s;ter. Appius &s;eemed to be &s;truck with the ju&s;tice of his claims; he ob&s;erved, that if the reputed father him|&s;elf were pre&s;ent, he might indeed be willing to de|lay the delivery of the maiden for &s;ome time, but that it was not lawful for him, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, to detain her from her lawful ma&s;ter. He therefore ad|judged her to Claudius, as his &s;lave, to be kept by him till Virginius &s;hould be able to prove his pater|nity. This &s;entence was received with loud clam|ours and reproaches by the multitude; the women in particular came round the innocent Virginia, as
<PB N="49" REF="60">
if willing to protect her from the judge's fury; while Icilius, her lover, boldly oppo&s;ed the decree, and obliged Claudius to take refuge under the tribunal of the decemvir. All things now threatened an open in&s;urrection, when Appius, fearing the event, thought proper to &s;u&s;pend his judgment till the arrival of Virginius, who was then about a eleven miles from Rome, with the army. The day following was fix|ed for the trial; and, in the mean time, Appius &s;ent letters to the generals to confine Virginius, as his arrival in town might only &s;erve to kindle &s;edition among the people. The&s;e letters, however, were intercepted by the centurion's friends, who &s;ent him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">il and relation of the de&s;ign laid again&s;t the li|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">y and the honour of his only daughter. Virgi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> upon this, pretending the death of a near rela|tion got permi&s;&s;ion to leave the camp, and flew to Rome, in&s;pired with indignation and revenge. Ac|cordingly, the next day he appeared before the tri|bun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to the a&s;toni&s;hment of Appius, leading his weeping daughter by the hand, both habited in the deepe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t mourning. Claudius, the accu&s;er, was al&s;o there, and began by making his demand. Virgini|us next &s;poke in turn; he repre&s;ented that his wife had many children; that &s;he had been &s;een pregnant by numbers; that, if he had intentions of adopting a &s;uppo&s;itious child, he would have fixed upon a boy rather than a girl; that it was notorious to all, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> wife had her&s;elf &s;uckled her own child; and that it was &s;urprizing &s;uch a claim &s;hould be now re|vived, after a fifteen years di&s;continuance. While the father &s;poke this with a &s;tern air, Virginia &s;tood trembling by, and, with looks of per&s;ua&s;ive inno|cence, added weight to all his remon&s;trances. The people &s;eemed entirely &s;atisfied of the hard&s;hip of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e, till Appius, fearing what he &s;aid might have dan|gerous effects upon the multitude, interrupted him, under a pretence of being &s;ufficiently in&s;tructed in the

merits of the cau&s;e. "Yes," &s;ays he, <Q>my con|&s;cience obliges me to declare, that I my&s;elf am a witne&s;s to the truth of the depo&s;ition of Claudius. Mo&s;t of this a&s;&s;embly know that I was left guar|dian to this youth, and I was very early apprized, that he had a right to this young woman; but the affairs of the public, and the di&s;&s;en&s;ions of the people, then prevented my doing him ju&s;tice. However, it is not now too late; and, by the power ve&s;ted in me for the public good, I adjudge Virginia to be the property of Claudius, the plain|tiff. Go, therefore, lictors, di&s;per&s;e the multi|tude, and make room for a ma&s;ter to repo&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of his &s;lave.</Q> The lictors, in obedience to his command, &s;oon drove off the throng that pre&s;&s;|ed round the tribunal; and now they &s;eized upon Virginia, and were delivering her up into the hands of Claudius, when Virginius, who found that all was over, &s;eemed to acquie&s;ce in the &s;entence. He therefore mildly entreated Appius to be permitted to take a la&s;t farewell of one whom he had long con&s;i|dered as his child, and, &s;o &s;atisfied, he would return to his duty with fre&s;h alacrity. With this the decem|vir complied, but upon condition that their endear|ments &s;hould pa&s;s in his pre&s;ence. Virginius, with the mo&s;t poignant angui&s;h, took his almo&s;t expiring daughter in his arms, for a while &s;upported her head upon his brea&s;t, and wiped away the tears that rolled down her lovely vi&s;age; and happening to be near the &s;hops that &s;urrounded the Forum, he &s;natched up a knife that lay on the &s;hambles, and addre&s;&s;ing his daughter. "My deare&s;t, lo&s;t child," cried he, <Q>this this alone can pre&s;erve your honour and your free|dom.</Q> So &s;aying, he buried the weapon in he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> brea&s;t, and then holding it up, reeking with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> blood of his daughter, "Appius," he cried, <Q>by this blood of innocence, I devote thy head to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> infernal gods.</Q> Thus &s;aying, with the blood<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

knife in his hand, and threatening de&s;truction to whom&s;oever &s;hould oppo&s;e him, he ran through the city, wildly calling upon the people to &s;trike for free|dom, and from thence went to the camp, in order to &s;pread a like flame through the army.</P>
<P>He no &s;ooner arrived at the camp, followed by a number of his friends, but he informed the army of all that was done, &s;till holding the bloody knife in his hand. He a&s;ked their pardon, and the pardon of the gods, for having committed &s;o ra&s;h an action, but a&s;cribed it all to the dreadful nece&s;&s;ity of the times. The army, already predi&s;po&s;ed, immediate|ly with &s;houts echoed their approbation, and de|camping, left their generals behind, to take their &s;ta|tion once more upon mount Aventine, whither they had retired about forty years before. The other army, which had been to oppo&s;e the Sabines, &s;eem|ed to feel a like re&s;entment, and came over in large parties to join them.</P>
<P>Appius, in the mean time, did all he could to quell the di&s;turbances in the city; but finding the tumult incapable of controul, and perceiving that his mortal enemies, Valerius and Horatius, were the mo&s;t active in oppo&s;ition, at fir&s;t attempted to find &s;afety by &s;light; neverthele&s;s, being encou|r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed by Oppius, who was one of his colleagues, he ventured to a&s;&s;emble the &s;enate, and urged the puni&s;h|ment of all de&s;erters. The &s;enate, however, were far from giving him the relief he &s;ought for; they fore&s;aw the dangers and mi&s;eries that threatened the &s;tate, in ca&s;e of oppo&s;ing the incen&s;ed army; they therefore di&s;patched me&s;&s;engers to them, offering to re&s;tore their former mode of government. To this propo&s;al all the people joyfully a&s;&s;ented, and the army gladly obeying, now returned to the city, if not with the en&s;igns, at lea&s;t with the plea&s;ure, of a triumphant entry. Appius and Oppius, one of his colleagues, both died by their own hands in pri&s;on.
<PB N="52" REF="63">
The other eight decemvirs went into voluntary exile; and Claudius, the pretended ma&s;ter of Virginia, was driven out after them.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the&s;e inte&s;tine tumults produc|ed weakne&s;s within the &s;tate, and confidence in the enemy abroad. The wars with the Aequi and Vol&s;ci &s;till continued, and, as each year &s;ome trifling advantages were obtained over the Romans, they, at la&s;t, advanced &s;o far, as to make their in|cur&s;ions to the very walls of Rome. <MILESTONE UNIT="U.C."

refu&s;ing to enli&s;t upon the approach of an enemy, the con&s;uls were forced to hold a private conference with the chief of the &s;enate; where, after many debates, Claudius propo&s;ed an expedient, as the mo&s;t proba|ble means of &s;atisfying the people in the pre&s;ent conjuncture. This was, to create &s;ix or eight gover|nors in the room of con&s;uls, whereof, one half, at lea&s;t, &s;hould be patricians. This project, which was, in fact, granting what the people demanded, plea&s;ed the whole meeting; and it was agreed, that at the next public meeting of the &s;enate, the con&s;uls &s;hould, contrary to their u&s;ual cu&s;tom, begin by a&s;k|ing the opinion of the younge&s;t &s;enator. Upon a&s;|&s;embling the &s;enate, one of the tribunes accu&s;ed them of holding &s;ecret meetings, and managing dangerous de&s;igns again&s;t the people. The con&s;uls, on the other hand, averred their innocence; and, to demon&s;trate their &s;incerity, gave any of the younger members of the hou&s;e leave to propound their opinions. The&s;e remaining &s;ilent, &s;uch of the older &s;enators as were known to be popular, began by ob&s;erving, that the people ought to be indulged in their reque&s;t, that none &s;o well de&s;erved power, as tho&s;e who were mo&s;t in&s;trumental in gaining it; and that the city could not be free until all were reduced to perfect equality. Claudius, &s;poke next; and, broke out into bitter in|vectives again&s;t the people; a&s;&s;erting, that it was his opinion that the law &s;hould not pa&s;s. This produc|ed &s;ome di&s;turbance among the plebeians; at length, Genutius, propo&s;ed, as had been preconcerted, that &s;ix governors &s;hould be annually cho&s;en, with con|&s;ular authority, three from the &s;enate, and three from the people; and that when the time of their magi|&s;tracy &s;hould be expired, then it would be &s;een whe|ther they would have the &s;ame office continued, or whether the con&s;ul&s;hip &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed upon its former <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ooting. This project was eagerly embraced by the people: yet &s;o &s;ickle were the multitude, that
<PB N="54" REF="65">
though many of the plebeians &s;tood, the choice whol|ly fell upon the patricians, who offered them&s;elves as candidates. <MILESTONE UNIT="U.C." N="310">  The&s;e new magi&s;trates were called Military Tribunes; they were at fir&s;t but three, afterwards they were encrea&s;ed to four, and at length to &s;ix. They had the power and en&s;igns of con&s;uls, yet that power being divided among a number, each &s;ingly was of le&s;s authority. The fir&s;t that were cho&s;en, only continued in office about three months, the augurs having found &s;ome|thing ami&s;s in the ceremonies of their election.</P>
<P>The military tribunes being depo&s;ed, the con&s;uls once more came into office; and, in order to lighten the weight of bu&s;ine&s;s which they were obliged to &s;u&s;tain, a new office was erected; namely, that of Cen&s;ors, to be cho&s;en every fifth year. Their bu&s;i|ne&s;s was to take an e&s;timate of the number and e&s;tates of the people, and to di&s;tribute them into their proper cla&s;&s;es; to in&s;pect into the lives and manners of their fellow-citizens; to degrade &s;enators for mi&s;|conduct; to di&s;mount knights, and to turn down plebeians from their tribes into an inferior, in ca&s;e of mi&s;demeanor. The two fir&s;t cen&s;ors were Papirius and Sempronius, both patricians; and from this order they continued to be elected for near an hun|dred years.</P>
<P>This new creation &s;erved to re&s;tore peace for &s;ome time among the orders; and a triumph gained over the Vol&s;cians by Geganius the con&s;ul, added to the uni|ver&s;al &s;atisfaction that reigned among the people.</P>
<P>This calm, however, was but of &s;hort continu|ance; <MILESTONE UNIT="U.C." N="313">  for, &s;ome time after, a famine pre&s;&s;ing hard upon the poor, the u&s;ual complaints again&s;t the rich were renewed; and the&s;e, as before, proving ineffectual, produced new &s;editions. The con&s;uls were accu&s;ed of neglect, in not having laid in proper quantities of corn; they, however, di&s;|regarded the murmurs of the populace, content with

exerting all their care in attempts to &s;upply the pre&s;&s;|ing nece&s;&s;ities. But though they did all that could be expected from active magi&s;trates, in providing and di&s;tributing provi&s;ions to the poor; yet Spurius Maeli|us, a rich knight, who had purcha&s;ed up all the corn of Tu&s;cany, by far out&s;hone them in liberality. This demagogue, enflamed with a &s;ecret de&s;ire of becom|ing powerful by the contentions in the &s;tate, di&s;tri|buted corn in great quantities among the poorer &s;ort each day, till his hou&s;e became the a&s;ylum of all &s;uch as wi&s;hed to exchange a life of labour for one of lazy dependence. When he had thus gained a &s;uf|ficient number of partizans, he procured large quan|tities of arms to be brought into his hou&s;e by night, and formed a con&s;piracy, by which he was to obtain the command, while &s;ome of the tribunes, whom he had found means to corrupt, were to act under him, in &s;eizing upon the liberties of his country. Minucius &s;oon di&s;covered the plot, and informing the &s;enate thereof, they immediately formed a re&s;olution of creating a dictator, who &s;hould have the power of quelling the con&s;piracy, without appealing to the people. Cincinnatus, who was now eighty years old, was cho&s;en once more to re&s;cue his country from impending danger. He began by &s;ummoning Maelius to appear; who refu&s;ed to obey. He next &s;ent Ahala, the ma&s;ter of his hor&s;e, to force him; who meeting him in the Forum, and pre&s;&s;ing Mae|lius to follow him to the dictator's tribunal, upon his refu&s;al, Ahala killed him upon the &s;pot. The dicta|tor applauded the re&s;olution of his officer, and com|manded the con&s;pirator's goods to be &s;old, and his hou&s;e to be demoli&s;hed, di&s;tributing his &s;tores among the people.</P>
<P>The tribunes of the people were much enraged at the death of Maelius; and, in order, to puni&s;h the &s;enate at the next election, in&s;tead of con&s;uls, in&s;i&s;t|ed

<P>The Veians had long been the rivals of Rome&punc; they had ever taken the opportunity of its internal di&s;tre&s;&s;es, to ravage its territories, and had even threatened its amba&s;&s;adors, &s;ent to complain of the&s;e injuries, with outrage. It &s;eemed now therefore de|termined, that the city of Veii, whatever it &s;hould co&s;t, was to fall; and the Romans accordingly &s;ate regularly down before it, prepared for a long and painful re&s;i&s;tance. The &s;trength of the place may be inferred from the continuance of the &s;iege, which la&s;ted for ten years; during which time, the army continued encamped round it, lying, in winter, un|der tents, made of the &s;kins of bea&s;ts, and in &s;um|mer, driving on the operations of the attack. Vari|ous was the &s;ucce&s;s, and many were the commanders that directed the &s;iege; &s;ometimes all the be&s;iegers works were de&s;troyed, and many of their men cut off by &s;allies from the town; &s;ometimes they were annoyed by an army of Veians, who attempted to bring a&s;&s;i&s;tance from without. A &s;iege &s;o bloody, &s;eemed to threaten depopulation to Rome it&s;elf, by draining its forces continually away; &s;o that a law was obliged to be made, for all the bachelors to marry the widows of the &s;oldiers who were &s;lain. In order so carry it on with greater vigour, Furius Ca|millus was created dictator, and to him was entru&s;t|ed the &s;ole power of managing the long protracted war. Camillus, who, without intrigue or any &s;olli|citation, had rai&s;ed him&s;elf to the fir&s;t eminence in the &s;tate, had been made one of the cen&s;ors &s;ome time before, and was con&s;idered as the head of that office; he was afterwards made a military tribune,
<PB N="57" REF="68">
and had in this po&s;t gained &s;everal advantages over the enemy. It was his great courage and abilities in the above offices, that made him thought mo&s;t worthy to &s;erve his country on this pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ion. Upon his appointment, numbers of the people flocked to his &s;tandard, confident of &s;ucce&s;s under &s;o experi|enced a commander. Con&s;cious, however, that he was unable to take the city by &s;torm, he &s;ecretly wrought a mine into it, with va&s;t labour, which opened into the mid&s;t of the citadel. Certain thus of &s;ucce&s;s, and finding the city incapable of relief, he &s;ent to the &s;enate, de&s;iring, that all who cho&s;e to &s;hare in the plunder of Veii, &s;hould immediately re|pair to the army. Then giving his men directions how to enter at the breach, the city was in&s;tantly filled with his legions, to the amazement and con|&s;ternation of the be&s;ieged, who, but a moment be|fore, had re&s;ted in perfect &s;ecurity. Thus, like a &s;econd Troy, was the city of Veii taken, after a ten years &s;iege; and, with its &s;poils enriched the con|querors; while Camillus him&s;elf, tran&s;ported with the honour of having &s;ubdued the rival of his native <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, triumphed after the manner of the kings of Rome, having his chariot drawn by four milk-white hor&s;es; a di&s;tinction which did not fail to di&s;gu&s;t the majority of the &s;pectators, as they con&s;idered tho&s;e as &s;acred, and more proper for doing honour to their g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> then their generals.</P>
<P>His u&s;ual good fortune attended Camillus in an|other expedition again&s;t the Fali&s;ci; he routed their army, and be&s;ieged their capital city Falerii, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">reatened a long and vigorous re&s;i&s;tance.

<PB N="58" REF="69">
having found means to decoy them into the Roman camp, offered to put them into the hands of Camil|lus, as the &s;ure&s;t means of inducing the citizens to a &s;peedy &s;urrender. The general was &s;truck with the treachery of a wretch, who&s;e duty it was to protect innocence, and not to betray it; he for &s;ome time regarded the traitor with a &s;tern air, but at la&s;t find|ing words, "Execrable villain," cried the noble Ro|man, <Q>offer thy abominable propo&s;als to creatures like thy&s;elf, and not to me; what though we be the enemies of your city, yet there are natural ties that bind all mankind, which &s;hould never be broken: there are duties required from us in war, as well as in peace: we fight not again&s;t an age of innocence, but again&s;t men; men who have u&s;ed us ill indeed, but yet, who&s;e crimes are virtues, when compared to thine. Again&s;t &s;uch ba&s;e arts, let it be my duty to u&s;e only Roman arts, the arts of valour and of arms.</Q> So &s;aying, he immedi|ately ordered him to be &s;tript, his hands tied behind him, and, in that ignominious manner, to be whip|ped into the town by his own &s;cholars. This gene|rous behaviour in Camillus effected more than his arms could do; the magi&s;trates of the town immedi|ately &s;ubmitted to the &s;enate, leaving to Camillus the conditions of their &s;urrender, who only fined them a &s;um of money to &s;atisfy his army, and received them under the protection and into the alliance of Rome.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the veneration which the virtues of Camillus had excited abroad, they &s;eemed but little adapted to bring over the re&s;pect of the turbulent tri|bunes at home, as they rai&s;ed &s;ome fre&s;h accu&s;ation again&s;t him every day. To the charge of being an oppo&s;er of their intended migration from Rome to Veii, they added that of his having concealed a part of the plunder of that city, particularly two brazen gates, for his own u&s;e, and appointed him a day, on
<PB N="59" REF="70">
which to appear before the people. Camillus find|ing the multitude exa&s;perated again&s;t him upon many accounts, dete&s;ting their ingratitude, re&s;olved not to await the ignominy of a trial; but, embracing his wife and children, prepared to depart from Rome. He had already pa&s;&s;ed as far as one of the gates, unat|tended, on his way, and unlamented. There he could &s;uppre&s;s his indignation no longer, but turn|ing his face to the Capitol, and lifting up his hands to Heaven, entreated all the Gods, that his country might one day be &s;en&s;ible of their inju&s;tice and ingra|titude; and &s;o &s;aying, he pa&s;t forward to take refuge at Ardea, a town at a little di&s;tance from Rome, where he afterwards learned, that he had been fined fifteen hundred a&s;&s;es by the tribunes at home.</P>
<P>The tribunes were not a little plea&s;ed with their triumph over this great man; but they &s;oon had rea|&s;on to repent their inju&s;tice, and to wi&s;h for the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of one, who alone was able to protect their country from ruin. For now a more terrible and redoubtable enemy began to make its appearance, than the Romans had ever yet encountered. The Gauls, a barbarous nation, had about two centuries before made an irruption from beyond the Alps, and &s;ettled in the northern parts of Italy. They had been invited over by the deliciou&s;ne&s;s of the wines, and the &s;oftne&s;s of the climate. Wherever they came, they di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;t the original inhabitants, as they were men of &s;uperior courage, extraordinary &s;tature, fierce in a&s;pect, barbarous in their manners, and prone to emigration. A body of the&s;e, wild from their ori|ginal habitations, were now be&s;ieging Clu&s;ium, a city of Etruria, under the conduct of Brennus, their king. The inhabitants of Clu&s;ium, frightened at their numbers, and &s;till more at their &s;avage appear|ance, entreated the a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or, at lea&s;t, the media|tion of the Romans. The &s;enate, who had long made it a maxim, never to refu&s;e &s;uccour to the
<PB N="60" REF="71">
di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, were willing, previou&s;ly to &s;end amba&s;&s;a|dors to the Gauls, to di&s;&s;uade them from their enter|prize, and to &s;hew the inju&s;tice of the irruption. Ac|cordingly, three young &s;enators were cho&s;en out of the family of the Fabii, to manage the commi&s;&s;ion, who &s;eemed more fitted for the field than the cabi|net. Brennus received them with a degree of com|plai&s;ance, that argued but little of the barbarian; and de&s;iring to know the bu&s;ine&s;s of their emba&s;&s;y, was an&s;wered according to their in&s;tructions, that it was not cu&s;tomary in Italy, to make war, but on ju&s;t grounds of provocation, and that they de&s;ired to know, what offence the citizens of Clu&s;ium had given to the king of the Gauls? To this Brennus &s;ternly replied, that the rights of valiant men lay in their &s;words; that the Romans them&s;elves had no right to the many cities they had conquered; and that he had particular rea&s;ons of re&s;entment again&s;t the people of Clu&s;ium, as they refu&s;ed to part with tho&s;e lands, which they had neither hands to till, nor inhabitants to occupy. The Roman amba&s;&s;adors, who were but little u&s;ed to bear the language of a conqueror, for a while di&s;&s;embled their re&s;entment at this haughty re|ply; but, upon entering the be&s;ieged city, in&s;tead of acting as amba&s;&s;adors, and forgetful of their &s;acred characters, headed the citizens in a &s;ally again&s;t the be&s;iegers. In this combat, Fabius Ambu&s;tus killed a Gaul with his own hand, but was di&s;covered, while he was di&s;poiling him of his armour. A con|duct &s;o unju&s;t and unbecoming, excited the re&s;ent|ment of Brennus, who, having made his complaint by an herald to the &s;enate, and finding no redre&s;s, immediately broke up the &s;iege, and marched away with his conquering army directly to Rome.</P>
<P>The countries through which the Gauls pa&s;&s;ed, in their rapid progre&s;s, gave up all hopes of &s;afety upon their approach; being terrified at their va&s;t numbers, the fiercene&s;s of their natures, and their dreadful pre|paration
<PB N="61" REF="72">
for war. But the rage and impetuo&s;ity of this wild people were directed only again&s;t Rome. They went on without doing the lea&s;t injury in their march, &s;till breathing vengeance only again&s;t the Romans; and a terrible engagement &s;oon after en&s;u|ed, in which the Romans were defeated near the ri|ver Allia, with the lo&s;s of near forty thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>Rome, thus deprived of all &s;uccour, prepared for every extremity. The inhabitants endeavoured to hide them&s;elves in &s;ome of the neighbouring towns, or re&s;olved to await the conqueror's fury, and end their lives with the ruin of their native city. But, more particularly, the ancient &s;enators, and prie&s;ts, &s;truck with a religious enthu&s;ia&s;m, on this occa&s;ion, re&s;olved to devote their lives to atone for the crimes of the people, and, habited in their robes of ceremo|ny, placed them&s;elves in the Forum, on their ivory chairs. The Gauls, in the mean time, were giving a loo&s;e to their triumph, in &s;haring and enjoying the plunder of the enemies camp. Had they immediate|ly marched to Rome upon gaining the victory, the Capitol it&s;elf had been taken; but they continued two days fea&s;ting upon the field of battle, and, with barbarous plea&s;ure, exulting amid&s;t their &s;laughter|ed enemies. On the third day after the victory, the ea&s;ine&s;s of which much amazed the Gauls, Brennus appeared with all his forces before the city. He was at fir&s;t much &s;urpri&s;ed to find the gates wide open to receive him, and the walls defencele&s;s; &s;o that he began to impute the unguarded &s;ituation of the place, to a &s;tratagem of the Romans. After proper precau|cautions he entered the city, and marching into the Forum, there beheld the ancient &s;enators &s;itting in their order, ob&s;erving a profound &s;ilence, unmoved and undaunted. The &s;plendid habits, the maje&s;tic gravity, and the venerable looks of the&s;e old men, who had all, in their time, borne the highe&s;t offices of
<PB N="62" REF="73">
the &s;tate, awed the barbarous enemy into reverence&punc; they took them to be the tutelar deities of the place, and began to offer blind adoration, till one, more forward than the re&s;t, put forth his hand to &s;troak the beard of Papyruis; an in&s;ult the noble Roman could not endure, but lifting up his ivory &s;cepter, &s;truck the &s;avage to the ground. This &s;eemed as a &s;ignal for general &s;laughter. Papyrius fell fir&s;t, and all the re&s;t &s;hared his fate, without mercy or di&s;tinc|tion. Thus the fierce invaders pur&s;ued their &s;laugh|ter for three days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, &s;paring neither &s;ex nor age, and then &s;etting fire to the city, burnt eve|ry hou&s;e to the ground.</P>
<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="U.C." N="364"> All the hopes of Rome were now placed in the Capitol; every thing without that fortre&s;s, was but an exten&s;ive &s;cene of mi&s;ery, de&s;olation, and de&s;pair. Brennus fir&s;t &s;ummoned it, with threats, to &s;ur|render, but in vain; he then re&s;olved to be&s;iege it in form, and hemmed it round with his army. Never|thele&s;s, the Romans repelled his attempts with great bravery; de&s;pair had &s;upplied them with that per&s;e|verance and vigour, which they &s;eemed to want when in pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>In the mean white, Brennus carried on the &s;iege with extreme ardour. He hoped, in time, to &s;tarve the garri&s;on into a capitulation; but they, &s;en&s;ible of his intent, although they were in actual want, cau&s;+ed &s;everal loaves to be thrown into his camp, to con|vince him of the futility of &s;uch expectations. His hopes &s;ailing in this, were &s;oon after revived, when &s;ome of his &s;oldiers came to inform him, that they had di&s;covered &s;ome foot &s;teps which led up to the rock, and by which they &s;uppo&s;ed the Capitol might be &s;urpri&s;ed. Accordingly, a cho&s;en body of his men were ordered by night upon this dangerous &s;er|vice, which they with great labour and difficulty al|mo&s;t effected; they were now got upon the very wall; the Roman centinel was fa&s;t a&s;leep; their dogs
<PB N="63" REF="74">
within gave no &s;ignal, and all promi&s;ed an in&s;tant victory, when the garri&s;on was awaked by the gab|bling of &s;ome &s;acred gee&s;e, that had been kept in the temple of Juno. The be&s;ieged &s;oon perceived the imminence of their danger, and each &s;natched the weapon he could in&s;tantly find, ran to oppo&s;e the a&s;&s;ailants. Manlius, a patrician of acknowledged bravery, was the fir&s;t who exerted all his &s;trength, and in&s;pired courage by his example. He boldly mounted the rampart, and, at one effort, threw two Gauls headlong down the precipice: others &s;oon came to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and the walls were cleared of the enemy, in a &s;pace of time &s;horter than that em|ployed in the recital.</P>
<P>From this time forward, the hopes of the barbari|ans began to decline, and Brennus wi&s;hed for an op|portunity of rai&s;ing the &s;iege with credit. His &s;ol|diers had often conferences with the be&s;ieged, while upon duty, and the propo&s;als for an accommodation were wi&s;hed for by the common men, before the chiefs thought of a congre&s;s. At length the com|manders on both &s;ides came to an agreement, that the Gauls &s;hould immediately quit the city and territo|ries of Rome, upon being paid a thou&s;and pounds weight of gold. This agreement being confirmed by oath on either &s;ide, the gold was brought forth, but, upon weighing, the Gauls attempted fraudu|lently to kick the beam, of which the Romans com|plaining, Brennus in&s;ultingly ca&s;t his &s;word and belt into the &s;cale, crying out, that the only portion of the vanqui&s;hed was to &s;uffer. By this reply, the Romans &s;aw that they were at the victor's mercy; and knew it was in vain to expo&s;tulate again&s;t any conditions he &s;hould be plea&s;ed to impo&s;e. But in this very juncture, and while they were thus debat|ing upon the payment, it was told them, that Ca|millus, their old general, was at the head of a large army, ha&s;tening to their relief, and entering
<PB N="64" REF="75">
the gates of Rome. Camillus actually appeared &s;oon after, and entering the place of controver&s;y, with the air of one who was re&s;olved not to &s;uffer impo&s;i|tion, demanded the cau&s;e of the conte&s;t; of which being informed, he ordered the gold to be taken and carried back to the Capitol, "For it has ever been," cried he, <Q>the manner with us Romans, to ran&s;om our country, not with gold, but with iron; it is I only that am to make peace, as being the dictator of Rome, and my &s;word alone &s;hall purcha&s;e it.</Q> Upon this, a battle en&s;ued, in which the Gauls were entirely routed; and &s;uch a &s;laughter followed, that the Roman territories were &s;oon cleared of their for|midable invaders. Thus, was Rome, by the bravery of Camillus cleared of its foes.</P>
<P>The city being one continued heap of ruins, ex|cept the Capitol, and the greate&s;t number of its for|mer inhabitants having gone to take refuge in Veii, the tribunes of the peop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e urged for the removal of the poor remains of Rome to Veii, where they might have hou&s;es to &s;helter, and walls to defend them. On this occa&s;ion, Camillus, attempted to appea&s;e them, with all the arts of per&s;ua&s;ion; ob&s;erving, that it was unworthy of them, both as Romans and as men, to de&s;ert the venerable &s;eats of their ance&s;tors, where they had been encouraged, by repeated marks of divine approbation, to remove to and inhabit a city which they had conquered, and which wanted even the good fortune of defending it&s;elf. By the&s;e and &s;uch like remon&s;trances, he prevailed upon the people to go contentedly to work; and Rome &s;oon began to ri&s;e from its a&s;hes.</P>
<P>We have already &s;een the bravery of Manlius in defending the Capitol, and &s;aving the la&s;t remains of Rome For this the people were by no means ungrateful, having built him an hou&s;e near the place where his valour was &s;o con&s;picuous, and having ap|pointed him a public fund for his &s;upport. But he
<PB N="65" REF="76">
a&s;pired at being not only equal to Camillus, but to be &s;overeign of Rome. With this view he laboured to ingratiate him&s;elf with the populace, paid their debts, and railed at the patricians, whom he called their oppre&s;&s;ors. The &s;enate was not ignorant of his di&s;cour&s;es or his de&s;igns, and created Cornelius Co&s;|&s;us dictator, with a view to curb the ambition of Manlius. The dictator &s;oon fini&s;hed an expedition again&s;t the Vol&s;cians, by a victory; and upon his return, called Manlius to an account, for his con|duct. Manlius, however, was too much the dar|ling of the populace, to be affected by the power of Co&s;&s;us, who was obliged to lay down his office, and Manlius was carried from confinement in triumph through the city. This &s;ucce&s;s only &s;erved to en|flame his ambition. He now began to talk of a divi|&s;ion of the lands among the people; in&s;inuated that there &s;hould be no di&s;tinctions in the &s;tate; and, to give weight to his di&s;cour&s;es, always appeared at the head of a large body of the dregs of the people, whom his large&s;&s;es had made his followers. The city be|ing thus filled with &s;edition and clamour, the &s;enate had recour&s;e to another expedient, and to oppo&s;e the power of Camillus to that of the demagogue. Ca|millus accordingly being made one of the military tribunes, appointed Manlius a day to an&s;wer for his life. The place in which he was tried was near the Capitol, where, when he was accu&s;ed of &s;edition, and of a&s;piring at &s;overeignty, he only turned his eyes and, pointing thither, put them in mind of what he had there done for his country. The multitude, who&s;e compa&s;&s;ion or who&s;e ju&s;tice &s;eldom &s;prings from rational motives, refu&s;ed to condemn him, while he pleaded in &s;ight of the Capitol; but when he was brought from thence to the Peteline grove, and where the Capitol was no longer to be &s;een, they condemned him to be thrown headlong from the Tarpeian rock. Thus, the place which had been the
<PB N="66" REF="77">
theatre of his glory, became that of his puni&s;hment and infamy. His hou&s;e, in which his con&s;piracies had been &s;ecretly carried on, was ordered to be razed to the ground, and his family were forbidden ever af|ter to a&s;&s;ume the name of Manlius.</P>
<P>In this manner therefore, the Romans went gra|dually forward, with a mixture of turbulence and &s;uper&s;tition within their walls, and &s;ucce&s;sful enter|prizes without. With what an implicit obedience they &s;ubmitted to their pontiffs, we have already &s;een in many in&s;tances; and how far they might be im|pelled, even to encounter death it&s;elf, at their com|mand, will evidently appear from the behaviour of Curtius about this time; <MILESTONE UNIT="U.C." N="392">  who, upon the opening of a gulph in the Forum, which the augurs af|firmed, would never clo&s;e up till the mo&s;t preci|ous things in Rome were thrown into it, this heroic man leaped with his hor&s;e and armour boldly into the mid&s;t, &s;aying, that nothing was more truly va|luable than patrioti&s;m and military virtue.

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. From the wars of the Samnites and the wars with Pyrrhus, to the beginning of the fir&s;t Punic war, when the Romans fir&s;t went out of Italy.</HEAD>
<P>THE Romans having now triumphed over the Sabines, the Etrurians, the Latins, the Hernici, the Aequi, and the Vol&s;cians, began to look for greater conque&s;ts. They accordingly turned their arms again&s;t the Samnites, a people about an hundred miles ea&s;t from the city, de&s;cended from the Sa|bines, and inhabiting a large tract of &s;outhern Italy, which at this day makes a con&s;iderable part of the
<PB N="67" REF="78">
kingdom of Naples. Valerius Corvus and Cornelius were the two con&s;uls, to who&s;e care it fir&s;t &s;ell to ma|nage this dreadful contention between the rival &s;tates.</P>
<P>Valerius was one of the greate&s;t commanders of his time; he was &s;urnamed Corvus, from a &s;trange circum&s;tance of being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a crow in a &s;ingle combat, in which he fought and killed a Gaul, of a gigantic &s;tature. To his colleague's care it was con|&s;igned to lead an army to Samnium, the enemies ca|pital, while Corvus was &s;ent to relieve Capua, the capital of the Campanians. Never was captain more fitted for command than he. To an habit na|turally robu&s;t and athletic, he jointed the gentle&s;t manners; he was the fierce&s;t, and yet the mo&s;t good-natured man in the army; and, while the meane&s;t centinel was his companion, no man kept them more &s;trictly to their duty; but what completes his charac|ter, he con&s;tantly endeavoured to pre&s;erve his digni|ties, by the &s;ame arts by which he gained them. Such &s;oldiers as the Romans then were, hardened by their late adver&s;ity, and led on by &s;uch a general, were unconquerable The Samnites were the brave&s;t men they ever yet encountered, and the contention between the two nations, was managed on both &s;ides with the mo&s;t determined re&s;olution. But the for|tune of Rome prevailed; the Samnites at length fled, averring, that they were not able to with&s;tand the fierce looks and the fire-darting eyes of the Romans. The other con&s;ul, however, was not at fir&s;t &s;o for|tunate; for having unwarily led his army into a de|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">, he was in danger of being cut off, had not De|cius, a tribune of the army, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which commanded the enemy; &s;o that the Sam|nites being attacked on either &s;ide, were defeated with great &s;laughter; not le&s;s than thirty thou&s;and of them being left dead upon the field of battle.</P>
<P>Sometime after this victory, the &s;oldiers who were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> at Capua mutinying, forced Quintius, an
<PB N="68" REF="79">
old and eminent &s;oldier, who was then re&s;iding in the country, to be their leader; and, conducted by their rage, more than their general, came within eight miles of the city. So terrible an enemy, al|mo&s;t at the gates, not a little alarmed the &s;enate, who immediately created Valerius Corvus, dictator, and &s;ent him forth with another army to oppo&s;e them. The two armies were now drawn up again&s;t each other, while fathers and &s;ons beheld them&s;elves prepared to engage in oppo&s;ite cau&s;es. Any other ge|neral but Corvus would, perhaps, have brought this civil war to an extremity; but he knowing his influ|ence among the &s;oldiery, in&s;tead of going forward to meet the mutineers in an ho&s;tile manner, went with the mo&s;t cordial friend&s;hip to embrace and expo|&s;tulate with his old acquaintances. His conduct had the de&s;ired effect. Quintius, as their &s;peaker, only de&s;ired to have their defection from their duty for|given; and as for him&s;elf, as he was innocent of their con&s;piracy, he had no rea&s;on to &s;ollicit pardon for his offences. Thus, this defection, which at fir&s;t threatened &s;uch dangers to Rome, was repaired by the prudence and moderation of a general, who&s;e ambition it was to be gentle to his friends, and for|midable only to his enemies.</P>
<P>A war between the Romans and the Latins follow+ed &s;oon after, but as their habits, arms, and lan|guage, were the &s;ame, the mo&s;t exact di&s;cipline was nece&s;&s;ary, to prevent confu&s;ion in the engagement. Orders, therefore, were i&s;&s;ued by Manlius, the con|&s;ul, that no &s;oldier &s;hould leave his ranks upon what|ever provocation; and that he &s;hould be certainly put to death, who &s;hould offer to do otherwi&s;e. With the&s;e injunctions, both armies were drawn out in array, and ready to begin, when Metius, the gene|ral of the enemies cavalry, pu&s;hed forward from his lines, and challenged any knight in the Roman army, to &s;ingle combat. For &s;ome time there was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="69" REF="80">
general pau&s;e, no &s;oldier offering to di&s;obey his or|ders, till Titus Manlius, the con&s;ul's own &s;on, burn|ing with &s;hame to &s;ee the whole body of the Romans intimidated, boldly &s;ingled out again&s;t his adver&s;ary. The &s;oldiers on both &s;ides, for a while, &s;u&s;pended the general engagement, to be &s;pectators of this fierce encounter. The two champions drove their hor&s;es again&s;t each other with great violence: Meti|us wounded his adver&s;ary's hor&s;e in the neck; but Manlius, with better fortune, killed that of Metius. The Latin being thus fallen to the ground, for a while attempted to &s;upport him&s;elf upon his &s;hield; but the Roman followed his blows with &s;o much force, that he laid him dead, as he was endeavour|ing to ri&s;e; and then de&s;poiling him of his armour, returned in triumph to the con&s;ul, his father's tent, where he was preparing and giving orders relative to the engagement. How&s;oever he might have been applauded by his fellow-&s;oldiers, being as yet doubt|ful of the reception he &s;hould find from his father, he came, with he&s;itation, to lay the enemy's &s;poils at his feet, and with a mode&s;t air in&s;inuated, that what he did, was entirely from a &s;pirit of hereditary virtue. But he was &s;oon dreadfully made &s;en&s;ible of his error, when his father, turning away, ordered him to be led publicly forth before the army. There being brought forward, the con&s;ul, with a &s;tern counte|nance, and yet with tears, &s;poke as follows: <Q>Titus Manlius, as thou ha&s;t regarded neither the dignity of the con&s;ul&s;hip, nor the commands of thy fa|ther; as thou ha&s;t de&s;troyed military di&s;cipline, and &s;et a pattern of di&s;obedience by thy example, thou has reduced me to the deplorable extremity of &s;acrificing my &s;on or my country. But let us not he&s;itate in this dreadful alternative; a thou&s;and lives were well lo&s;t in &s;uch a cau&s;e: nor do I think, that thou thy&s;elf wilt refu&s;e to die, when thy coun|try is to reap the advantage of thy &s;ufferings. Go,
<PB N="70" REF="81">
lictor, bind him, and let his death be our future example.</Q> The whole army was &s;truck with hor|ror at this unnatural mandate; fear, for a while, kept them in &s;u&s;pen&s;e; but when they &s;aw their young champion's head &s;truck off, and his blood &s;treaming upon the ground, they could no longer contain their execrations, and their groans His dead body was carried forth without the camp, and being adorned with the &s;poils of the vanqui&s;hed enemy, was buried with all the pomp of military di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the battle joined with mutual fury; and as the two armies had often &s;ought under the &s;ame leaders, they combated with all the animo|&s;ity of a civil war. The Latins chiefly depended on their bodily &s;trength; the Romans, on their invinci|ble courage and conduct. Forces &s;o nearly matched, &s;eemed only to require the protection of their deities, to turn the &s;cale of victory; and, in fact, the augurs had foretold, that whatever part of the Roman army &s;hould be di&s;tre&s;t, the commander of that part &s;hould devote him&s;elf for his country, and die as a &s;acrifice to the immortal gods. Manlius commanded the right wing; and Decius led on the left. Both &s;ides fought, for &s;ome time, with doubtful &s;ucce&s;s, as their courage was equal; but, after a time, the left wing of the Roman army began to give ground. It was then that Decius, who commanded there, re&s;olved to devote him&s;elf for his country, and to offer his own life, as an atonement to &s;ave his army. Thus de|termined, he called out to Manlius with a loud voice, and demanded his in&s;tructions, as he was the chief pontiff, how to devote him&s;elf, and the form of the words he &s;hould u&s;e. By his directions, therefore, being cloathed in a long robe, his head covered, and his arms &s;tretched forward, &s;tanding upon a javelin, he devoted him&s;elf to the cele&s;tial and infernal gods, for the &s;afety of Rome. Then arming him&s;elf, and
<PB N="71" REF="82">
mounting on hor&s;eback, he drove furiou&s;ly into the mid&s;t of the enemies, carrying terror and con&s;terna|tion wherever he came, till he fell covered with wounds. In the mean time the Roman army con&s;i|dered his devouting him&s;elf in this manner, as an a&s;|&s;urance of &s;ucce&s;s: nor was the &s;uper&s;tition of the Latins le&s;s powerfully influenced by his re&s;olution, a total rout began to en&s;ue; the Romans pre&s;&s;ed them on every &s;ide, and &s;o great was the carnage, that &s;carce a fourth part of the enemy &s;urvived the defeat. This was the la&s;t battle of any con&s;equence, that the Latins had with the Romans; they were forced to beg a peace upon hard conditions, and two years af|ter, their &s;tronge&s;t city, Paedum, being taken, they were brought under an entire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Ro|man power.</P>
<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="U.C." N="431"> A &s;ignal di&s;grace which the Romans &s;u&s;tained about this time in their conte&s;t with the Samnites, made a pau&s;e in their u&s;ual good fortune, and turned the &s;cale for a while, in the enemies favour. The &s;enate having denied the Samnites peace, Pontius, their general, was re&s;olved to gain by &s;tratagem, what he had frequently lo&s;t by force. Accordingly, lead|ing his army into a defile, called Claudium, and tak|ing po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all its outlets, he &s;ent ten of his &s;ol|diers, habited like &s;hepherds, with directions to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ow them&s;elves in the way the Romans were to march. Exactly to his wi&s;hes, the Roman con&s;ul met them, and taking them for what they appeared, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">anded the route the Samnite army had taken: they, with &s;eeming indifference, replied, that they were gone to Luceria, a town in Apulia, and were then actually be&s;ieging it. The Roman general, not &s;u&s;pecting the &s;tratagem that was laid again&s;t him, marched directly by the &s;horte&s;t road, which lay through the defiles, to relieve the city; and was not undeceived, till he &s;aw his army &s;urrounded, and blocked up on every &s;ide. Pontius, thus having the
<PB N="72" REF="83">
Romans entirely in his power, fir&s;t obliged the army to pa&s;s under the yoke, having been previou&s;ly &s;tript of all but their garments; he then &s;tipulated, that they &s;hould wholly quit the territories of the Samnites, and that they &s;hould continued to live upon terms of former confederacy. The Romans were con&s;trained to &s;ubmit to this ignominious treaty, and marched into Capua di&s;armed, half-naked, and burning with a de&s;ire of retrieving their lo&s;t honour. When the army arrived at Rome, the whole city was mo&s;t &s;ur|pri&s;ingly afflicted at their &s;hameful return; nothing but grief and re&s;entment was to be &s;een, and the whole city was put into mourning.</P>
<P>But this was a tran&s;itory calamity, the &s;tate had &s;uffered a diminution of its glory, but not of its power. The war was carried on as u&s;ual, for many years: the power of the Samnites declining every day, while that of the Romans gathered fre&s;h confi|dence from every victory. Under the conduct of Papyrius Cur&s;or, who was at different times con&s;ul and dictator, repeated triumphs were gained. Fabi|us Maximus al&s;o had his &s;hare in the glory of con|quering them; and Decius, the &s;on of that Decius, whom we &s;aw devoting him&s;elf for his country, about forty years before, followed the example of his no|ble father, and, ru&s;hing into the mid&s;t of the enemy, &s;aved the lives of his countrymen with the lo&s;s of his own.</P>
<P>The Samnites being us driven to the mo&s;t extreme di&s;tre&s;s, as they were unable to defend them&s;elves, they were obliged to call in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a foreign power, and have recour&s;e to Pyrrhus, king of Epi|rus, to &s;ave them from impending ruin. Pyrrhus, a king of great courage, ambition, and power, had al|ways kept the example of Alexander, his great pre|dece&s;&s;or, before his eyes, promi&s;ed to come to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and, in the mean time, di&s;patched over a body of three thou&s;and men, under the command

of Cineus, an experienced &s;oldier, and a &s;cholar of the great orator Demo&s;thenes. Nor did he him&s;elf remain long behind, but &s;oon after put to &s;ea with three thou&s;and hor&s;e, twenty thou&s;and foot, and twenty elephants, in which the commanders of that time began to place very great confidence. How|ever only a &s;mall part of the&s;e great preparations ar|rived in Italy with him, for many of his &s;hips were di&s;per&s;ed, and &s;ome were totally lo&s;t in a tempe&s;t.

Pyrrhus being appri&s;ed of the enemies at|tempt, at fir&s;t hoped to cut off their cavalry, before they could be reinforced by the foot, that were not as yet got over, and led on in per&s;on a cho&s;en body of hor&s;e again&s;t them. The Roman legions having, with much difficulty, advanced acro&s;s the river, the engagement became general; the Greeks fought with a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their former fame, and the Romans with a de&s;ire of gaining fre&s;h glory; mankind had never before &s;een two &s;uch differently di&s;ciplined armies oppo&s;ed to each other, nor is it to this day determined, whether the Greek phalanx o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Roman legion were preferable. The combat was long in &s;u&s;pen&s;e; the Romans had &s;even times repul&s;ed the enemy, and were as often driven back them&s;elves; but at length, while the &s;ucce&s;s &s;eemed doubtful, Pyrrhus &s;ent his elephants into the mid&s;t of the engagement, and the&s;e turned the &s;cale of victory in his favour. The Romans, who had never before &s;een creatures of &s;uch magnitude, were terrified not only with their intrepid fiercene&s;s, but the ca&s;tles that were built upon their backs, filled with armed men. It was then that Pyrrhus &s;aw the day was his own; and &s;ending in his The&s;&s;alian cavalry to charge the enemy in di&s;order, the rout became ge|neral.

<P>Pyrrhus, after this victory, was &s;till unwilling to drive them to an extremity, and con&s;idered, that it was be&s;t treating with an humbled enemy; he re&s;olved therefore to &s;end his friend Cineas, the orator, to ne|gociate a peace; of whom he often a&s;&s;erted, that he had won more towns by the eloquence of Cineas, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">han by his own arms.

<P><PB N="77" REF="88">This battle fini&s;hed the campaign; the next &s;ea&s;on began with equal vigour on both &s;ides, Pyrrhus having received new &s;uccours from home. While the two armies were approaching, and yet but at a &s;mall di&s;tance from each other, a letter was brought to old Fabricius, the Roman general, from the king's phy&s;ician, importing, that, for a proper reward, he would take him off by poi&s;on, and thus rid the Ro|mans of a powerful enemy and a dangerous war. Fabricius felt all the hone&s;t indignation at this ba&s;e propo&s;al, that was con&s;i&s;tent with his former charac|ter, he communicated it to his colleague, and in|&s;tantly gave it as his opinion, that Pyrrhus &s;hould be informed of the treachery that was plotted again&s;t him. Accordingly, letters were di&s;patched for that purpo&s;e, informing Pyrrhus of the affair, and al|ledging the unfortunate choice of his friends and enemies. That he had tru&s;ted and promoted mur|derers, while he carried his re&s;entment again&s;t the generous and the brave Pyrrhus now began to find that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e bold barbarians were by degrees &s;chooled into refinement, and would not &s;uffer him to be their &s;uperior even in genero&s;ity: he received the me&s;&s;age with as much amazement at their candour, as indignation at his phy&s;ician's treachery. <Q>Ad|mirable Fabricius!</Q> cried he, <Q>it would be as ea&s;y to turn the &s;un from its cour&s;e, as thee from the paths of honour.</Q> Then making the proper enquiry among&s;t his &s;ervants, and having di&s;cover|ed the trea&s;on, he ordered his phy&s;ician to be execut|ed. However, not to be outdone in magnanimity, he immediately &s;ent to Rome all his pri&s;oners with|out ran&s;om, and again de&s;ired to negotiate a peace. The Romans, on the other hand, refu&s;ed him peace, but upon the &s;ame conditions they had offered be|fore.</P>
<P>So that, after an interval of two years, Pyrrhus, having encrea&s;ed his army by new levies, &s;ent one

part of his army to oppo&s;e the march of Lentulus, the Roman con&s;ul, while he him&s;elf went to attack Cu|rius Dentatus the other in command, before his col|league could come up. His principal aim was to &s;upri&s;e the enemy by night; but unfortunately pa&s;&s;|ing through woods, and his lights failing him, his men lo&s;t their way, &s;o that at the approach of morn|ing, he &s;aw him&s;elf in &s;ight of the Roman camp, with the enemy drawn out ready to receive him. The vanguard of both armies &s;oon met, in which the Ro|mans had the advantage. Soon after a general en|gagement en&s;uing, Pyrrhus finding the balance of the victory turning &s;till again&s;t him, had once more recour&s;e to his elephants. The&s;e, however, the Romans were then too well acquainted with to feel any vain terrors from; and having found that fire was the mo&s;t effectual means to repel them, they cau&s;ed a number of balls to be made, compo&s;ed of flax and ro&s;in, which were thrown again&s;t them as they approached the ranks. The elephants, thus render|ed furious by the flame, and as boldly oppo&s;ed by the &s;oldiers, could no longer be brought on; but ran back upon their own army, bearing down the ranks, and filling all places with terror and confu&s;ion. Thus victory, at length, declared in favour of Rome: Pyrrhus, in vain, attempted to &s;top the flight and &s;laughter of his troops; he lo&s;t not only twenty-three thou&s;and of his be&s;t &s;oldiers, but his camp was al&s;o taken. This &s;erved as a new le&s;&s;on to the Romans, who were ever open to improvement: they had formerly pitched their tents without order; but by this new capture, they were taught to mea|&s;ure out their ground, and fortify the whole with a trench; &s;o that many of their &s;ucceeding victories are to be a&s;cribed to their improved method of en|camping.</P>
<P>Pyrrhus thus finding all hopes fruitle&s;s, he re|&s;olved to leave Italy, where he found only de&s;perate

enemies and faithle&s;s allies: accordingly, calling together the Tarentines, he informed them, that he had received a&s;&s;urances from Greece, of &s;peedy a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, and de&s;iring them to wait the event with tranquillity, the night following embarked his troops, and returned undi&s;turbed into his native kingdom with the remains of his &s;hattered forces, leaving a garri&s;on in Tarentum merely to &s;ave ap|pearances, and, in this manner ended the war with Pyr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hus, after &s;ix years continuance.</P>
<P>As for the poor luxurious Tarentines, who were the original promoters of this war, they &s;oon began to find a wor&s;e enemy in the garri&s;on that was left for their defence, than in the Romans who attacked them from without. The hatred between them and Milo, who commanded their citadel for Pyrrhus, was become &s;o great, that nothing but the fear of their old inveterate enemies, the Romans, could equal it. In this di&s;tre&s;s they applied to the Carthaginians, who with a large fleet came and blocked up the port of Tarentum; &s;o that this unfortunate people, once famous through Italy for their refinements and plea|&s;ures, now &s;aw them&s;elves contended for by three different armies, without the choice of a conqueror. At length, however, the Romans found means to bring over the garri&s;on to their intere&s;t; after which, they ea&s;ily became ma&s;ters of the city, and demoli&s;hed its walls, granting the inhabitants liberty and protection.</P>

<P>THE Romans having de&s;troyed all rival preten|&s;ions at home, began to pant after foreign conque&s;ts. The Carthaginians were at that time in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the greate&s;t part of Sicily, and, like the Romans, only wanted an opportunity of embroiling the natives, in order to become ma&s;ters of the whole i&s;land. This opportunity at length offered. Hiero, king of Syracu&s;e, one of the &s;tates of that i&s;land, which was as yet unconquered, entreated their aid again&s;t the Mamertines, a little people of the &s;ame country, and they &s;ent him &s;upplies both by &s;ea and land. The Mamertines, on the other hand, to &s;hield off impend|ing ruin, put them&s;elves under the protection of Rome. The Romans, not thinking the Mamer|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters"> worthy of the name of allies, in&s;tead of pro|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ding to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, boldly declared war again&s;t Carthage; alledging as a rea&s;on, the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which Carthage had lately &s;ent to the &s;outhern parts of Italy again&s;t the Romans. In this manner a war was de|clared between the&s;e two powerful &s;tates, both grown too great to continue patient &s;pectators of each others encrea&s;e.</P>
<P>Carthage, a colony of the Phoenicians, was built on the coa&s;t of Africa, near the place where Tunis now &s;tands, about an hundred and thirty-&s;even years before the foundation of Rome. As it had been long growing into power, &s;o it had extended its do|minions all along the coa&s;ts. But its chief &s;trength lay in its fleets and commerce: thus circum&s;tanced,
<PB N="81" REF="92">
the&s;e two great powers began what is called the fir&s;t Punic war. The Carthaginians, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of gold and &s;ilver, which might be exhau&s;ted; the Romans famous for per&s;everance, patrioti&s;m, and pover|ty, which &s;eemed to gather &s;trength by every de|feat.</P>
<P>But there &s;eemed to be an in&s;urmountable ob&s;tacle to the ambitious views of Rome, as they had no fleet, or at lea&s;t what de&s;erved that title; while the Carthaginians had the entire command at &s;ea, and kept all the maritime towns under obedience. In &s;uch a &s;ituation, any people but the Romans would have re&s;ted contented, under di&s;advantages which nature &s;eemed to have impo&s;ed; but nothing could conqueror or intimidate them. They began to ap|ply them&s;elves to maritime affairs; and, though without &s;hipwrights to build, or &s;eamen to navigate a fleet, they re&s;olved to &s;urmount every ob&s;tacle with inflexible per&s;everance. A Carthaginian ve&s;&s;el hap|pened to be in a &s;torm driven a&s;hore, and this was &s;ufficient to &s;erve as a model. The con&s;ul Duillius was the fir&s;t who ventured to &s;ea with his new con|&s;tructed armament; and, though far inferior to the enemy in the management of his fleet, yet he gained the fir&s;t naval victory, the Carthaginians lo&s;ing fifty o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their &s;hips, and the undi&s;turbed &s;overeignty of the &s;ea, which they valued more.</P>
<P>But the conque&s;t of Sicily, was only to be obtain|tained by humbling the power of Carthage at home. For this rea&s;on, the &s;enate re&s;olved to carry the war i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> Africa it&s;elf, and accordingly they &s;ent Regulus and Manlius, with a fleet a three hundred &s;ail, to make the inva&s;ion. Regulus was reckoned the mo&s;t con&s;ummate warrior that Rome could then produce; and a profe&s;&s;ed example of frugal &s;everity. His pa|trioti&s;m was &s;till greater than his temperance; all the private pa&s;&s;ions &s;eemed extingui&s;hed in him, or they were all &s;wallowed up in one great ruling affection,

the love of his country. The two generals &s;et <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with their fleet, which was the greate&s;t that had ever yet left an Italian port, carrying an hundred and forty thou&s;and men. They were met by the Car|thaginians, with a fleet as powerful, and men better u&s;ed to the &s;ea. While the fight continued, rather between the &s;hips than the men, at a di&s;tance, the Carthaginians &s;eemed &s;ucce&s;sful; but when the Ro|mans came to grapple with them, the difference be|tween a mercenary army, and one that fought for fame, was apparent. The re&s;olution of the Ro|mans was crowned with &s;ucce&s;s; the enemies fleet were di&s;per&s;ed, and fifty-four of their ve&s;&s;els taken. The con&s;equence of this victory was an immediate de&s;cent upon the coa&s;ts of Africa, and the capture of the city Clupea; together with twenty thou&s;and men who were made pri&s;oners of war.</P>
<P>The &s;enate being informed of the&s;e great &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and applied to for fre&s;h in&s;tructions, commanded Manlius back to Italy, in order to &s;uperintend the Si|cilian war; and directed that Regulus &s;hould con|tinue in Africa, to pro&s;ecute his victories there.</P>
<P>A battle en&s;ued, in which Carthage was once more defeated, and &s;ome of its be&s;t troops were cut off. This fre&s;h victory contributed to throw them into the utmo&s;t de&s;pair; more than eighty of their towns &s;ubmitted to the Romans. In this di&s;tre&s;s, the Carthaginians, de&s;titute of generals at home, were obliged to &s;end to Lacedemon, offering the command of their armies to Xantippus, a general of great expe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ience, who undertook to conduct them.</P>
<P>This general began by giving the magi&s;trates pro|per in&s;tructions for levying their men: he a&s;&s;ured them, that their armies were hitherto overthrown, not by the &s;trength of the enemy, but by the ignorance of their own generals; he therefore only required a ready obedience to his orders, and a&s;&s;ured them of an ea&s;y victory. The whole city &s;eemed
<PB N="83" REF="94">
once more revived from de&s;pondence, by the exhor|tations of a &s;ingle &s;tranger; and &s;oon, from hope, grew into confidence. This was the &s;pirit the Gre|cian general wi&s;hed to excite in them; &s;o that when he &s;aw them thus ripe for the engagement, he joy|fully took the field. The Lacedemonian made the mo&s;t &s;kilful di&s;po&s;ition of his forces; he placed his cavalry in the wings; he di&s;po&s;ed the elephants at proper intervals, behind the line of the heavy-armed infantry; and, bringing up the light-armed troops before, he ordered them to retire through the line of infantry, after they had di&s;charged their weapons. At length both armies engaging, after a long and ob|&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, the Romans were overthrown with dreadful &s;laughter; the greate&s;t part of their army being de&s;troyed, and Regulus him&s;elf taken pri|&s;oner. Several other di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Romans fol|lowed &s;oon after this. They lo&s;t their whole fleet in a &s;torm; and Agrigentum, their principal town in Sicily, was taken by Karthalo, the Carthaginian general. They undertook to build a new fleet, which al&s;o &s;hared the fate of the former; the ma|riners, as yet unacquainted with the Mediterranean &s;hores, drove it upon quick&s;ands; and, &s;oon after, the greate&s;t part peri&s;hed in a &s;torm.</P>
<P>Mean time, the Carthaginians, being thus &s;ucce&s;s|ful, were de&s;irous of a new treaty for peace, hoping to have better terms than tho&s;e in&s;i&s;ted upon by Re|gulus. For this purpo&s;e they &s;uppo&s;ed, that he, whom they had now for four years kept in a dungeon, confined and chained, would be a proper &s;olicitor. It was expected, that, being wearied with impri|&s;onment and bondage, he would gladly endeavour to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">de his countrymen to a di&s;continuance of the war, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ich only prolonged his captivity. He was accordingly &s;ent with their amba&s;&s;adors to Rome, but with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">mi&s;e, previou&s;ly exacted from him, to re|turn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of being un&s;ucce&s;sful. He was even
<PB N="84" REF="95">
given to under&s;tand, that his life depended upon the &s;ucce&s;s of his negociation.</P>
<P>When this old general, together with the amba&s;&s;a|dors of Carthage, approached Rome, numbers of his friends came out to meet and congratulate his return. Their acclamations re&s;ounded through the city; but Regulus refu&s;ed, with &s;ettled melancholy, to enter the gates. It was in vain that he was entreated on every &s;ide to vi&s;it once more his little dwelling, and &s;hare in that joy which his return had in&s;pired. He per&s;i&s;ted in &s;aying, that he was now but a &s;lave be|longing to the Carthaginians, and unfit to partake in the liberal honours of his country. The &s;enate a&s;|&s;embling without the walls, as u&s;ual, to give audi|ence to the amba&s;&s;adors, Regulus opened his com|mi&s;&s;ion as he had been directed by the Carthaginian council, and their amba&s;&s;adors &s;econded his propo|&s;als. The &s;enate were, by this time, them&s;elves weary of a war, which had been protracted above eight years, and were no way di&s;inclinable to a peace. It only remained for Regulus him&s;elf to give his opinion, who, when it came to his turn to &s;peak, to the &s;urprize of all the world, gave his voice for continuing the war. So unexpected an advice not a little di&s;turbed the &s;enate: they pitied, as well as ad|mired a man who had u&s;ed &s;uch eloquence again&s;t his private intere&s;t, and could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> conclude upon a mea|&s;ure which was to terminate in his ruin. But he &s;oon relieved their embarra&s;ment by breaking off the treaty, and by ri&s;ing in order to return to his bonds and confinement. It was in vain that the &s;enate and all his deare&s;t friends entreated his &s;tay; he &s;till re|pre&s;&s;ed their &s;olicitations. Marcia his wife, with her little children, filled the city with her lamenta|tions, and vainly entreated to be permitted to &s;ee him: he &s;till ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ted in keeping his pro|mi&s;e; and, though &s;ufficiently appri&s;ed of the tor|tures that awaited his return, without embracing his
<PB N="85" REF="96">
family, or taking leave of his friends, he departed with the amba&s;&s;adors for Carthage.</P>
<P>Nothing could equal the fury and the di&s;appoint|ment of the Carthaginians, when they were inform|ed by their amba&s;&s;adors, that Regulus, in&s;tead of ha&s;tening a peace, had given his opinion for con|tinuing the war. They accordingly prepared to puni&s;h his conduct with the mo&s;t &s;tudied tortures. Fir&s;t, his eye-lids were cut off, and then he was re|manded to pri&s;on. He was, after &s;ome days, again brought out and expo&s;ed with his face oppo&s;ite the burning &s;un. At la&s;t, when malice was fatigued with &s;tudying all the arts of torture, he was put into a barrel &s;tuck full of nails that pointed in|wards, and in this painful po&s;ition he continued till he died.</P>
<P>Both &s;ides now took up arms with more than for|mer animo&s;ity. At length the Roman per&s;everance was crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, one victory followed on the back of another. Fabius Buteo, the con&s;ul, once more &s;hewed them the way to naval victory, by de|feating a large &s;quadron of the enemies &s;hips; but Lutatius Catulus gained a victory &s;till more complete, in which the power of Carthage &s;eemed totally de|&s;troyed at &s;ea, by the lo&s;s of an hundred and twenty &s;hips, according to the &s;malle&s;t computation. This lo&s;s brought the Carthaginians to &s;ue for peace, which Rome thought proper to grant; but, &s;till inflexible in its demands, exacted the &s;ame conditions which Re|gulus had formerly offered at the gates of Carthage. The&s;e were, that they &s;hould lay down a thou&s;and talents of &s;ilver, to defray the charge of the war; and &s;hould pay two thou&s;and two hundred more, in ten years time: that they &s;hould quit Sicily, with all &s;uch i&s;lands as they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed near it: that they &s;hould never make war again&s;t the allies of Rome, or come with any ve&s;&s;els of war within the Roman dominions: and la&s;tly, that all their pri&s;oners and de&s;erters &s;hould

be delivered up without ran&s;om. To the&s;e hard conditions, <MILESTONE UNIT="U.C."

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. From the end of the fir&s;t Punic war to the end of the &s;econd.</HEAD>
<P>THE war being ended between the Carthagini|ans and Romans, a profound peace en&s;ued, and, in about &s;ix years after, the temple of Janus was &s;hut for the &s;econd time &s;ince the foundation of the city. The Romans being thus in friend&s;hip with all na|tions, had an opportunity of turning to the arts of peace: they now began to have a reli&s;h for poetry, the fir&s;t liberal art which ri&s;es in every civilized nation, and the fir&s;t al&s;o that decays. Hitherto they had been entertained only with the rude drolleries of their lowe&s;t buffoons: they had &s;ports called Fe&s;cennini, in which a few debauched actors made their own parts, while raillery and &s;mut &s;upplied the place of humour. To the&s;e a compo&s;ition of a higher kind &s;ucceeded which they called &s;atire; which was a kind of dramatic poem, in which the characters of the great were particularly pointed out, and made an ob|ject of deri&s;ion to the vulgar. After the&s;e, came tra|gedy and comedy, which were borrowed from the Greeks; and, indeed, the fir&s;t dramatic poet of Rome, who&s;e name was Livius Andronicus, was by birth a Grecian. <MILESTONE UNIT="U.C."

<P>While they were thus admitting the arts of peace, they were not unmindful of making fre&s;h preparations for war: all intervals of ea&s;e &s;eemed rather to give fre&s;h vigour for new de&s;igns, than to relax their for|mer intrepidity. The Illyrians were the fir&s;t people upon whom they tried their &s;trength, after &s;ome continuance of peace. That nation, <MILESTONE UNIT="U.C." N="527"> which had long plundered the merchants of the Me|diterranean with impunity, happened to make depre|dations upon &s;ome of the trading &s;ubjects of Rome: this being complained of to Teuta, the queen of the country, &s;he, in&s;tead of granting redre&s;s, order|ed the amba&s;&s;ador, that was &s;ent to demand re&s;titution, to be murdered. A war en&s;ued, in which the Ro|mans were victorious; mo&s;t of the Illyric towns were &s;urrendered to the con&s;uls, and a peace at la&s;t concluded, by which the greate&s;t part of the country was ceded to Rome; a yearly tribute was exacted for the re&s;t, and a prohibition added, that the Illyrians &s;hould not &s;ail beyond the river Li&s;&s;us, with more than two barks, and tho&s;e unarmed.</P>
<P>The Gauls were the next people that incurred the di&s;plea&s;ure of the Romans. Suppo&s;ing a time of peace, when the armies were di&s;banded, a proper &s;ea&s;on for new irruptions, this barbarous people invit|ed fre&s;h forces from beyond the Alps, and entering Etruria, wa&s;ted all with fire and &s;word, till they came within about three days journey of Rome.

enabled to &s;urround the Gauls, who &s;till retained their primaeval barbarity. It was in vain that tho&s;e hardy troops, who had nothing but their courage to protect them, formed two fronts to oppo&s;e their ad|ver&s;aries; their naked bodies and undi&s;ciplined forces were unable to with&s;tand the &s;hock of an enemy completely armed, and &s;killed in military evolutions. A mi&s;erable &s;laughter en&s;ued, in which forty thou|&s;and were killed, and ten thou&s;and taken pri&s;oners. This victory was followed by another gained over them by Marcellus, in which he killed Viridomarus, their king, with his own hand, and gained the third royal &s;poils that were yet obtained at Rome. The&s;e conque&s;ts forced them to beg a peace, the conditions of which &s;erved greatly to enlarge the empire. Thus the Romans went on with &s;ucce&s;s; they had now totally recovered their former lo&s;&s;es, and only wanted an enemy worthy of their arms, to begin a new war.</P>
<P>The Carthaginians had only made a peace becau&s;e they were no longer able to continue the war. They, therefore, took the earlie&s;t opportunity of breaking the treaty: they be&s;ieged Saguntum, a city of Spain, which had been in alliance with Rome; and, though de&s;ired to de&s;i&s;t, pro&s;ecuted their operations with vigour. Amba&s;&s;adors were &s;ent, in con&s;equence, from Rome to Carthage, complaining of the infrac|tion of their articles, and requiring that Hannibal, the Carthaginian general, who had advi&s;ed this mea|&s;ure, &s;hould be delivered up; which being refu&s;ed, both &s;ides prepared for a &s;econd Punic war.</P>
<P>The Carthaginians tru&s;ted the management of it, on their &s;ide, to Hannibal, the &s;on of Amilcar. This extraordinary man had been made the &s;worn foe of Rome, almo&s;t from his infancy; for, while yet very young, his father brought him before the altar, and obliged him to take an oath, that he never would be in friend&s;hip with the Romans, nor de&s;i&s;t from op|po&s;ing

their power, until he or they &s;hould be no more. On his fir&s;t appearance in the field, he re|conciled, in his own per&s;on, the mo&s;t ju&s;t method of commanding, with the mo&s;t perfect obedience to his &s;uperiors. Thus he was equally beloved by his ge|nerals and the troops he was appointed to lead. He was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the greate&s;t courage in oppo&s;ing dan|ger, and the greate&s;t pre&s;ence of mind in retiring from it. No fatigue was able to &s;ubdue his body, nor any misfortune to break his &s;pirit: equally patient of heat and cold, he only took &s;u&s;tenance to content nature, and not to delight his appetite. He was the be&s;t hor&s;eman, and the &s;wifte&s;t runner of his time. This great general, who is con&s;idered as the mo&s;t &s;kilful of antiquity, having over-run all Spain, and levied a large army of various languages and nations, be re&s;olved to carry the war into Italy it&s;elf, as the Romans had before carried it into the dominions of Carthage. For this purpo&s;e, leaving Hanno with a &s;ufficient force to guard his conque&s;ts in Spain, he cro&s;&s;ed the Pyrenean mountains into Gaul, with an army of fifty thou&s;and foot and nine thou&s;and hor&s;e. He quickly traver&s;ed that country, which was then wild and exten&s;ive, and filled with nations that were his declared enemies. In vain its fore&s;ts and rivers appeared to intimidate him; in vain the Rhone with its rapid current, and its banks covered with ene|mies; or the Dura branched out into numberle&s;s channels, oppo&s;ed his way; he pa&s;&s;ed them all with per&s;everance, and in ten days arrived at the foot of the Alps, over which he was to explore a new pa&s;&s;age into Italy. It was in the mid&s;t of winter, when this a&s;toni&s;hing project was undertaken. The &s;ea&s;on ended new horrors to a &s;cene, that nature had already crowded with objects of di&s;may. The prodigious height and tremendous &s;teepne&s;s of the mountains, c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ped with &s;now; the people barbarous and fierce, dre&s;&s;ed in &s;kins, with long and &s;haggy hair; pre&s;ent|ed

a pictured that impre&s;&s;ed the beholders with a&s;to|ni&s;hment and terror. But nothing was capable of &s;ubduing the courage of the Carthaginian general; for, at the end of fifteen days &s;pent in cro&s;&s;ing the Alps, he found him&s;elf in the plains of Italy, with about half his army remaining; the re&s;t having died of the cold, or being cut off by the natives.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as it was known at Rome, that Hanni|bal, at the head of an immen&s;e army, was cro&s;&s;ing the Alps, in order to invade their dominions, the &s;e|nate &s;ent Scipo to oppo&s;e him, who was obliged to retreat with con&s;iderable lo&s;s. In the mean time, Hannibal being thus victorious, took the mo&s;t pru|dent precautions to encrea&s;e his army; giving orders always to &s;pare the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Gauls, while his depredations were permitted upon tho&s;e of Rome; and this &s;o plea&s;ed that &s;imple people, that they de|clared for him in great numbers, and flocked to his &s;tandard with alacrity.</P>
<P>The &s;econd battle was fought upon the banks of the river Trebia. The Carthaginian general being appri&s;ed of the Roman impetuo&s;ity, of which he al|ways availed him&s;elf in almo&s;t every engagement, had &s;ent off a body of a thou&s;and hor&s;e, each with a foot &s;oldier behind, acro&s;s the river, to ravage the enemies country, and provoke them to engage. The Romans quickly routed this force, who, &s;eeming to be defeated, took the river, and were as eagerly pur&s;ued by Sempronius, the con&s;ul. It was not, however, till his army was got upon the oppo&s;ite bank, that he perceived him&s;elf half conquered al|ready, his men being fatigued with wading up to their armpits, and quite benumbed by the inten&s;e coldne&s;s of the water. A total rout en&s;ued; twen|ty-&s;ix thou&s;and of the Romans were either killed by the enemy, or drowned in attempting to repa&s;s the river. A body of ten thou&s;and men were all that &s;urvived; who, finding them&s;elves enclo&s;ed on every
<PB N="91" REF="102">
&s;ide, broke de&s;perately through the enemies ranks, and fought retreating, till they &s;ound &s;helter in the city of Placentia.</P>
<P>The Third defeat the Romans &s;u&s;tained was at the lake of Thra&s;imene; near to which was a chain of mountains, and, between the&s;e and the lake, a nar|row pa&s;&s;age lending to a valley that was embo&s;omed in hills. It was upon the&s;e hills that Hannibal di&s;|po&s;ed his be&s;t troops, and it was into this valley that Flaminius, the Roman general, led his men to at|tack him. A di&s;po&s;ition every way &s;o favourable for the Carthaginians, was al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;ted by accident; for a mi&s;t ri&s;ing from the lake, kept the Romans from &s;eeing their enemies; while the army upon the mountains, being above its influence, &s;aw the whole di&s;po&s;ition of their opponents. The fortune of the day was &s;uch as might be expected from the conduct of the two generals; the Roman army was broken, and &s;laughtered, almo&s;t before they could perceive the enemy that de&s;troyed them. About fifteen thou|&s;and Romans, together with Flaminius him&s;elf, fell in the valley, and &s;ix thou&s;and more were obliged to yield them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war.</P>
<P>Upon the news of this defeat at Rome, after the general con&s;ternation was allayed, the &s;enate, upon mature deliberation, re&s;olved to elect a commander with ab&s;olute authority, in whom they might repo&s;e their la&s;t and greate&s;t expectations. Their choice fell upon Fabius Maximus, a man of great courage, but with a happy mixture of caution. He was appri&s;ed that the only way to humble the Carthaginians at &s;uch a di&s;tance from home, was rather by harra&s;&s;ing them than by fighting. For this purpo&s;e, he always encamped upon the highe&s;t grounds, inacce&s;&s;ible to the enemies cavalry. Whenever they moved he moved, watched their motions, &s;traightened their quarters, and cut off their provi&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="103">By the&s;e arts, Fabius had actually, at one time, enclo&s;ed Hannibal among mountains, where it was impo&s;&s;ible to winter; and yet, from which it was almo&s;t impracticable to extricate his army without eminent danger. In this exigence, nothing but one of tho&s;e &s;tratagems of war, which fall to the lot of great abilities only to invent, could &s;ave him: he ordered a number of &s;mall fagots and lighted torches to be tied to the horns of two thou&s;and oxen, that he had in his camp, and that they &s;hould be driven to|wards the enemy. The&s;e to&s;&s;ing their heads, and running up the &s;ides of the mountains, &s;eemed to fill the whole neighbouring fore&s;t with fire; while the centinels that were placed to guard approaches of the mountain, &s;eeing &s;uch a number of flames ad|vancing towards their po&s;ts, &s;led in con&s;ternation, &s;uppo&s;ing the whole body of the enemy was in arms to overwhelm them. By this &s;tratagem, Hannibal drew off his army, and e&s;caped through the defiles that led beneath the hills, though with con&s;iderable damage to his rear.</P>
<P>Soon after, Fabius was obliged to lay down his of|fice, his time being expired, and Terentius Varro was cho&s;en by the majority to &s;ucceed to the com|mand. This Terentius Varro was a man &s;prung from the dregs of the people, with nothing but his confidence and riches to recommend him. With him was joined Aemilius Paulus, of a di&s;po&s;ition en|tirely oppo&s;ite; experienced in the field, cautious in action, and impre&s;&s;ed with a thorough contempt for the abilities of his plebeian colleague.</P>
<P>The Romans finding them&s;elves enabled to bring a competent force into the field, being almo&s;t ninety thou&s;and &s;trong, now again re&s;olved to meet Hanni|bal, who was at this time encamped near the village of Cannae, with a wind that for a certain &s;ea&s;on blows &s;till one way, in his rear, which rai&s;ing great clouds

of du&s;t from, the parched plains behind, he knew mu&s;t greatly di&s;tre&s;s an approaching enemy. In this &s;ituation he waited the coming up of the Romans, with an army of forty thou&s;and foot and half that number of cavalry. The two con&s;uls &s;oon appeared, to his wi&s;h, dividing their forces into two parts, and agreeing to take the command every day by turns. On the fir&s;t day of their arrival, it falling to the lot of Aemilius to command, he was entirely aver&s;e to engaging. The next day, however, it being come to Varro's turn to command, he, without a&s;king his colleague's concurrence, gave the &s;ignal for battle; and pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing the river Au&s;idus, that lay between both armies, put his forces in array. The battle began with the light-armed infantry; the hor&s;e engaged &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n after; and the Roman cavalry being unable to &s;tand again&s;t tho&s;e of Numidia, the legions came up to reinforce them.

At la&s;t the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> became general in every part of the Roman army; the boa&s;tings of Varro were now no longer heard; while Aemilius, who had been terribly wounded by a &s;linger in the very beginning of the engagement, &s;till feebly led on his body of hor&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd did all that could be done to make head again&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e enemy; however, being unable to &s;it on hor&s;e|back, he was forced to di&s;mount.

In this battle the Romans lo&s;t fifty thou|&s;and men, and &s;o many knights, that it is &s;aid, Hannibal &s;ent three bu&s;hels of go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> rings to Carthage, which tho&s;e of this order had worn on their fingers.</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t con&s;ternation was abated, after this dreadful blow, at Rome, the &s;enate came to a general re&s;olution, to create a dictator, in order to give &s;trength to their government. A &s;hort time after, Varro arrived, having left behind him the wretched remains of his army; and, as he had been the prin|cipal cau&s;e of the late calamity, it was natural to &s;up|po&s;e, that the &s;enate would &s;everely reprimand the ra&s;hne&s;s of his conduct. But far otherwi&s;e! The Romans went out in multitudes to meet him; and the &s;enate returned him thanks, that he had not de|&s;paired of the &s;afety of Rome. Fabius, who was con|&s;idered as the &s;hield of Rome, and Marcellus as the &s;word, were appointed to lead the armies; and, though Hannibal once more offered them peace, they refu&s;ed it, but upon condition that he &s;hould quit Italy.&mdash;Terms &s;imilar to tho&s;e they had formerly in|&s;i&s;ted upon from Pyrihus.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="106">In the mean time, Hannibal, either finding the impo&s;&s;ibility of marching directly to Rome, or will|ing to give his forces re&s;t after &s;uch a mighty victory, led them to Capua, where he re&s;olved to winter. This city had long been con&s;idered as the nur&s;e of luxury, and the corrupter of all military virtue; here, therefore, a new &s;cene of plea&s;ure opened to his bar|barian troops; and they at once gave them&s;elves up to the intoxication, till, from being hardy veterans, they became infirm rioters.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have found this great man &s;ucce&s;sful; but now we are to rever&s;e the picture, and &s;urvey him &s;truggling with accumulated misfortunes, and, at la&s;t, &s;inking beneath them.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t lo&s;s was at the &s;iege of Nola, where Mar|cellus the praetor made a &s;ucce&s;sful &s;ally. He &s;ome time after attempted to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Capua, and attacked the Romans in their trenches, but he was repul&s;ed with con&s;iderable lo&s;s. He then made a feint of going to be&s;iege Rome; but finding a &s;uperi|or army ready to receive him, he was obliged to re|tire. For &s;ome years after, he fought with various &s;ucce&s;s; Marcellus, his opponent, <MILESTONE UNIT="U.C."

<P>The &s;enate of Carthage, at length, came to a re|&s;olution of &s;ending his brother A&s;drubal to his a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, with a body of forces drawn out of Spain. A&s;drubal's march being made known to the con&s;uls, Livius and Nero, they went again&s;t him with great expedition, and &s;urrounding him in a place, into which he was led by the treachery of his guides, they cut his whole army to pieces Hannibal had long expected the&s;e &s;uccours with impatience; and the very night on which he had been a&s;&s;ured of his brother's arrival, Nero ordered A&s;drubal's head to be

cut off, and thrown into his brother's camp. The Carthaginian general now, therefore, began to per|ceive the approaches of the downfall of Carthage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and could not help, with a &s;igh, ob&s;erving to tho&s;e about him, that fortune &s;eemed fatigued with grant|ing her favours.</P>
<P>In the mean time, fortune &s;eemed to favour the Roman arms in other parts; Marcellus took the city of Syracu&s;e in Sicily, which was defended by the machines and the fires of Archimedes the ma|thematician.</P>
<P>The inhabitants were put to the &s;word; and mong the re&s;t, Archimedes him&s;elf, who was found meditating in his &s;tudy, by a Roman &s;oldier. Mar|cellus, the general, was not a little grieved at his death. A pa&s;&s;ion for letters, at that time, began to prevail among the higher ranks of people at Rome. He therefore ordered his body to be honourably buri|ed, and a ton b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o be erected to his memory, which his own works have long &s;urvived.</P>
<P>As to their fortunes in Spain, though for a while they appeared doubtful, two of the Scipios being &s;lain, and Claudius Nero, the governor of the pro|vince, appearing much an under-match for the cun|ning of the Carthaginian general; yet they &s;oon re|covered their complexion under the conduct of Scipio Africanus, who &s;ued for the office of procon&s;ul, to that kingdom, at a time when every one el&s;e was willing to decline it. Scipio, who was now but twenty-four years old, had all the qualifications re|qui&s;ite for forming a great general, and a good man: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e united the greate&s;t courage with the greate&s;t ten|derne&s;s; &s;uperior to Hannibal in the arts of peace, and almo&s;t his equal in tho&s;e of war.

<PB N="97" REF="108">
yet &s;ubduing &s;till more by his genero&s;ity, mildne&s;s, and benevolent di&s;po&s;ition, than by the force of his arms.</P>
<P>It was &s;hortly after, that he returned with an army from the conque&s;t of Spain, and was made con&s;ul at the age of twenty-nine. It was at fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed, he intended meeting Hannibal in Italy, and that he would attempt driving him from thence; but he had already formed a wi&s;er plan, which was to carry the war into Africa, and, while the Carthaginians kept an army near Rome, to make them tremble for their own capital.</P>
<P>Scipio was not long in Africa without employ|ment; for, in a &s;hort time, Hanno oppo&s;ed him, but he was defeated and &s;lain. Syphax, the u&s;urper of Numidia, led up a large army again&s;t him. The Roman general, for a time, declined &s;ighting, till finding an opportunity, he &s;et fire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the enemy's tents, and attacking them in the mid&s;t of the con|fu&s;ion, killed forty thou&s;and men, and took &s;ix thou|&s;and pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>The Carthaginians now beginning to be terrified at their repeated defeats, and the fame of Scipio's &s;ucce&s;&s;es, determined to recall Hannibal, their great champion, out of Italy, in order to oppo&s;e the Ro|mans at home. Deputies were accordingly di&s;|patched, with a po&s;itive command, for him to re|turn and oppo&s;e the Roman general, who at that time threatened Carthage with a &s;iege. Nothing could exceed the regret and di&s;appointment of Hanni|bal, upon receiving this order. However, he obey|ed the orders of his infatuated country, with the &s;ame &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion that the meane&s;t &s;oldier would have done, and took leave of Italy, with tears in his eyes, after having kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t beautiful parts of it for above fifteen years.</P>
<P>Upon his arrival at Leptis, in Africa, from whence he marched to Adrumetum, he at la&s;t approached
<PB N="98" REF="109">
Zama, a city within five days journey of Carthage. Scipio, in the mean time, led his army to meet him, joined by Ma&s;&s;ini&s;&s;a, with &s;ix thou&s;and hor&s;e; and, to &s;hew his rival in the field, how little he fear|ed his approach, &s;ent back the &s;pies which were &s;ent to explore his camp, having previou&s;ly &s;hewn them the whole, with directions to inform Hanni|bal of what they had &s;een. The Carthaginian gene|ral, con&s;cious of his inferiority, endeavoured to di&s;|continue the war by negociation; and de&s;ired a meeting with Scipio, to confer upon terms of peace, to which the Roman general a&s;&s;ented. But, after a long conference, both &s;ides parting di&s;&s;atisfied, they returned to their camps, to prepare for deciding the controver&s;y by the &s;word. Never was a more me|morable battle fought, whether we regard the gene|rals, the armies, the two &s;tates that contended, or the empire that was in di&s;pute. The di&s;po&s;ition Hannibal made of his men, is &s;aid, by the &s;kilful in the art of war, to be &s;uperior to any, even of his for|mer arrangements. The battle began with the elephants, on the &s;ide of the Carthaginians, which being terrified at the cries of the Romans, and wounded by the &s;lingers and archers, turned upon their drivers, and cau&s;ed much confu&s;ion in both wings of their army, in which the cavalry was placed. Being thus deprived of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the hor&s;e, in which their greate&s;t &s;trength con&s;i&s;ted, the heavy infantry joined on both &s;ides; but the Ro|mans being &s;tronger of body, the Carthaginians were obliged to give ground. In the mean time, Ma&s;&s;ini&s;|&s;a, who had been in pur&s;uit of their cavalry, return|ing and attacking them in the rear, completed their defeat. A total rout en&s;ued, twenty thou&s;and men were killed in the battle or the pur&s;uit, and as many were taken pri&s;oners. Hannibal, who had done all that a great general and an undaunted &s;oldier could perform, fled with a &s;mall body of hor&s;e to Adrume|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">um,

<P>This victory brought on a peace. The Carthagi|nians, by Hannibal's advice, offered conditions to the Romans, which they dictated, not as rivals, but as &s;overeigns.

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. From the end of the &s;econd Punic war to the end of the third, which terminated in the de&s;truction of Carthage.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE the Romans were engaged with Han|nibal, they carried on al&s;o a vigorous war again&s;t Philip, king of Macedonia, not a little incited there|to by the prayers of the Athenians; who, from once controlling the power of Per&s;ia, were now unable to defend them&s;elves. The Rhodians, with Attalus, king of Pergamus, al&s;o entered into the confederacy again&s;t Philip. He was more than once defeated by Galba, the con&s;ul, who was &s;ent again&s;t him. He attempted to be&s;iege Athens, but the Romans oblig|ed him to rai&s;e the &s;iege. He attempted to take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;treights of Thermopylae, but was dri|ven from them, by Quintus Flaminius, with great &s;laughter. He attempted to take refuge in The&s;&s;aly, where he was again defeated, with con&s;iderable lo&s;s,
<PB N="100" REF="111">
and obliged to beg a peace, upon condition of pay|ing a thou&s;and talents, half down, and the other half in the &s;pace of ten years. The peace with Philip gave the Romans an opportunity of &s;hewing their ge|nero&s;ity, by re&s;toring liberty to Greece.</P>
<P>Antiochus, king of Syria, was next brought to &s;ub|mit to the Roman arms; after &s;ome emba&s;&s;ies on the one &s;ide and the other, a war was declared again&s;t him, five years after the conclu&s;ion of the Macedo|nian war.</P>
<P>After various mi&s;takes and mi&s;conduct, he at|tempted to obtain a peace, by offering to quit all his places in Europe; and &s;uch in A&s;ia as profe&s;&s;ed al|liance to Rome. But it was now too late, Scipio perceiving his own &s;uperiority, was re&s;olved to avail him&s;elf of it. Antiochus, thus driven into re|&s;i&s;tance, for &s;ome time retreated before the enemy, till, being pre&s;&s;ed hard, near the city of Magne&s;ia, he was forced to draw out his men, to the number of &s;eventy thou&s;and foot, and twelve thou&s;and hor&s;e. Scipio oppo&s;ed him with forces, as much inferior in number as they were &s;uperior in courage and di&s;|cipline. Antiochus therefore was in a &s;hort time en|tirely defeated; his own chariots, armed with &s;cythes, being driven back upon his men, contributed much to his overthrow. Being thus reduced to the la&s;t ex|tremity, he was glad to procure peace of the Ro|mans, upon their own terms; which were, to pay fifteen thou&s;and talents towards the expences of the war; to quit all his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Europe, and like wi&s;e all in A&s;ia, on that &s;ide Mount Taurus; to give twenty ho&s;tages, as pledges of his fidelity; and to deliver up Hannibal, the inveterate enemy o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Rome.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Hannibal, who&s;e de&s;tructio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was one of the articles of this extorted treaty, en+deavoured to avoid the threatened ruin. This con+&s;ummate general had been long a wanderer, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

exile from his ungrateful country. He had taken re|fuge at the court of Antiochus, who, at fir&s;t, gave him a &s;incere welcome, and made him admiral of his fleet, in which &s;tation he &s;hewed his u&s;ual &s;kill in &s;tratagem. But he &s;oon &s;unk in the Syrian's e&s;teem, for having advi&s;ed &s;chemes, which that mo|narch had neither genius to under&s;tand, nor talents to execute. Sure, therefore, to find no &s;afety or protection, he departed by &s;tealth; and, after wan|dering for a time among petty &s;tates, who had neither power nor genero&s;ity to protect him, he took refuge at the court of Pru&s;ias, king of Bithynia. In the mean time, the Romans, with a vindictive &s;pirit utterly unworthy of them, &s;ent Aemilius, one of their mo&s;t celebrated generals, to demand him of this king; who, fearing the re&s;entment of Rome, and willing to conciliate their friend&s;hip, by this breach of ho&s;pitality, ordered a guard to be placed upon Hannibal, with an intent to deliver him up. The poor old general, thus implacably per&s;ecuted from one country to another, and finding all me|thods of &s;afety cut off, determined to die: he there|fore, de&s;ired one of his followers to bring him poi|&s;on, which he had ready for this exigence; and drinking it, he expired, as he had lived, with intre|pid bravery.</P>
<P>A &s;econd Macedonian war was &s;oon after proclaimed again&s;t Per&s;eus, the &s;on of Philip, <MILESTONE UNIT="U.C." N="583">  whom we have already &s;een obliged to beg peace of the Romans. Per&s;eus, in order to &s;ecure the crown, had contrived to murder his brother De|metrius; and, upon the death of his father, plea&s;ed with the hopes of imaginary triumphs, made war again&s;t Rome. During the cour&s;e of this war, which continued about three years, many opportuni|ties were offered him of cutting off the Roman army; but being perfectly ignorant how to take ad|vantage of their ra&s;hne&s;s, he &s;pent the time in empty

overtures for a peace. At length, Aemilius gave him a deci&s;ive overthrow near the river Enipeus. He attempted to procure &s;afety by flying into Crete; but being abandoned by all, he was obliged to &s;urrender him&s;elf, and to grace the &s;plendid triumph of the Roman general.</P>
<P>About this time, Ma&s;&s;ini&s;&s;a, the Numidian, hav|ing made &s;ome incur&s;ions into a territory claimed by the Carthaginians, they attempted to repel the inva|&s;ion. This brought on a war between that monarch and them; while the Romans, who pretended to con&s;ider this conduct of theirs as an infraction of the treaty, &s;ent to make a complaint. The amba&s;&s;adors who were employed upon this occa&s;ion finding the city very rich and flouri&s;hing, from the long interval of peace which it had now enjoyed for near fifty years, either from motives of avarice to po&s;&s;e&s;s its plunder, or from fear of its growing greatne&s;s, in&s;i&s;t|ed much on the nece&s;&s;ity of a war, which was &s;oon after proclaimed, and the con&s;uls &s;et out with a thorough re&s;olution utterly to demoli&s;h Carthage.</P>
<P>The wretched Carthaginians finding that the con|querors would not de&s;i&s;t from making demands, while they had any thing left to &s;upply, attempted to &s;often the victors by &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; but they received orders to leave their city, which was to be levelled with the ground. This &s;evere command they re|ceived with all the concern and di&s;tre&s;s of a de&s;pair|ing people: they implored for a re&s;pite from &s;uch an hard &s;entence; they u&s;ed tears and lamentations&punc; but finding the con&s;uls inexorable, they departed with a gloomy re&s;olution, prepared to &s;uffer the ut|mo&s;t extremities, and to fight to the la&s;t for their &s;ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of empire.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els, therefore, of gold and &s;ilver, which their luxury had taken &s;uch pride in, were convert+ed into arms. The women parted al&s;o with thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ornaments, and even cut off their hair to be con|verted

into &s;trings for the bowmen. A&s;drubal, who had been lately condemned for oppo&s;ing the Romans, was now taken from pri&s;on to head their army; and &s;uch preparations were made, that, when the con&s;uls came before the city, which they expected to find an ea&s;y conque&s;t, they met with &s;uch re&s;i&s;tance, as quite di&s;pirited their forces, and &s;hook their re&s;olution. Se|veral engagements were fought before the walls, with di&s;advantage to the a&s;&s;ailants; &s;o that the &s;iege would have been di&s;continued, had not Scipio Aemi|lianus, the adopted &s;on of Africanus, who was now appointed to command it, u&s;ed as much &s;kill to &s;ave his forces after a defeat, as to in&s;pire them with fre&s;h hopes of victory. But all his arts would have fail|ed, had he not found means to &s;educe Pharneas, the ma&s;ter of the Carthaginian hor&s;e, who came over to his &s;ide. The unhappy town&s;men, &s;oon &s;aw the ene|my make nearer approaches; the wall which led to the haven was quickly demoli&s;hed, &s;oon after, the Forum it&s;elf was taken, which offered the conque|rors, a deplorable &s;pectacle of hou&s;es nodding to the fall, heaps of men lying dead, hundreds of the wounded &s;truggling to emerge from the carnage a|round them, and deploring their own and their country's ruin. The citadel &s;oon after &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion. All now but the temple was &s;ubdued, and that was defended by de&s;erters from the Roman army, and tho&s;e who had been mo&s;t forward to un|dertake the war. The&s;e, however, expecting no mercy, and finding their condition de&s;perate, &s;et fire to the building, and voluntarily peri&s;hed in the flames. This was the end of one of the mo&s;t re|nowned cities in the world, both for arts, opulence, and extent of dominion; it had rivalled Rome for above an hundred years, and, at one time, was thought to have the &s;uperiority.</P>
<P>This conque&s;t over Carthage, was &s;oon followed by many over other &s;tates. Corinth, one of the noble&s;t

cities of Greece, in the &s;ame year, &s;u&s;tained the &s;ame fate, being entered by Mummius, the con&s;ul, and levelled to the ground. Scipio al&s;o having laid &s;iege to Numantia, the &s;tronge&s;t city in Spain, the wretch|ed inhabitants, to avoid falling into the hands of the enemy, fired the city over their own heads; and all, to a man, expired in the flames. Thus Spain be|came a province belonging to Rome, and was govern|ed thenceforward by two annual praetors.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. From the de&s;truction of Carthage to the end of the &s;edition of the Gracchi.  <MILESTONE REND="inBrackets" UNIT="U.C." N="621"> </HEAD>
<P>THE Romans now being left without a rival, the triumphs and the &s;poils of A&s;ia, brought in a ta&s;te for &s;plendid expence; and the&s;e produced ava|rice and inverted ambition. The two Gracchi were the fir&s;t who &s;aw this &s;trange corruption among the great, and re&s;olved to repre&s;s it, by renewing the Li|cinian law, which had enacted, that no per&s;on in the &s;tate &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s above five hundred acres of land. Tiberius Gracchus, the elder of the two, was a per&s;on very con&s;iderable both for the advan|tages of his body, and the qualities of his mind. Very different from Scipio, of whom he was the grand&s;on, he &s;eemed more ambitious of power than de&s;irous of glory: his compa&s;&s;ion for the oppre&s;&s;ed was equal to his animo&s;ity again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ors; but unhappily his pa&s;&s;ions, rather than his rea&s;on, operated even in his pur&s;uits of virtue; and the&s;e al|ways drove him beyond the line of duty. This was the di&s;po&s;ition of the elder Gracchus, who found the lower part of the people ready to &s;econd all his pro|po&s;als. This law, though at fir&s;t carried on with proper moderation, greatly di&s;gu&s;ted the rich, who
<PB N="105" REF="116">
endeavoured to per&s;uade the people, that the propo&s;er only aimed at di&s;turbing the government, and put|ting all things into confu&s;ion. But Gracchus, who was a man of the greate&s;t eloquence of his time, ea&s;ily wiped off the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions from the minds of the people, already irritated with their wrongs; and, at length, the law was pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The death of Attalus, king of Pergamus, furni&s;h|ed Tiberius Gracchus with a new opportunity of gratifying the meaner part of the people, at the ex|pence of the great. This king had by his la&s;t will left the Romans his heirs; and it was now propo&s;ed, that the money &s;o left, &s;hould be divided among the poor, in order to furni&s;h them with proper uten&s;ils for cultivating the lands, which became theirs by the late law of partition. This cau&s;ed &s;till greater di&s;|turbances than before: the &s;enate a&s;&s;embled upon this occa&s;ion, in order to con&s;ult the mo&s;t proper me|thods of &s;ecuring the&s;e riches to them&s;elves, which they now valued above the &s;afety of the common|wealth: they had numerous dependents, who were willing to give up liberty for plenty and ea&s;e: the&s;e therefore, were commanded to be in readine&s;s, to intimidate the people, who expected no &s;uch oppo&s;i|tion; and who were now attending to the harrangues of Tiberius Gracchus in the Capitol. Here, as a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lamour was rai&s;ed by the clients of the great on one &s;ide, and by the favourers of the law on the other, Tiberius found his &s;peech intirely interrupted, and begged, in vain, to be attended to; till at la&s;t, rai&s;|ing his hand to his head, to intimate that his life was in danger, the partizans of the &s;enate gave out, that he wanted a diadem. In con&s;equence of this, an univer&s;al uproar &s;pread it&s;elf through all ranks of peo|ple; the corrupt part of the &s;enate were of opinion, that the con&s;ul &s;hould defend the commonwealth by force of arms; but this prudent magi&s;trate declining &s;uch violence, Scipio Na&s;ica, kin&s;man to Gracchus,
<PB N="106" REF="117">
immediately ro&s;e up, and, preparing him&s;elf for the conte&s;t, de&s;ired that all who would defend the digni|ty and the authority of the laws, &s;hould follow him&punc; Upon this, attended by a large body of &s;enators and clients, armed with clubs, he went directly to the Capitol, &s;triking down all who ventured to re&s;i&s;t Tiberius perceiving by the tumult, that his life was &s;ought for, endeavoured to fly; and throwing a&s;ide his robe, to expedite his e&s;cape, attempted to g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> through the throng; but happening to fall over a per|&s;on already on the ground, Saturnius, one of his colleagues in the tribune&s;hip, who was of the oppo|&s;ite faction, &s;truck him dead with a piece of a &s;eat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and not le&s;s than three hundred of his hearers &s;hared the &s;ame fate, being killed in the tumult. Nor did the vengeance of the &s;enate re&s;t here, but extended to numbers of tho&s;e who &s;eemed to e&s;pou&s;e his cau&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> many of them were put to death, many were ba|ni&s;hed, and nothing was omitted to in&s;pire the people with an abhorrence of his pretended crimes.</P>
<P>Caius Gracchus, the brother of him who was &s;lain, was but twenty-one upon the death of Tiberius, and as he was too young to be much dreaded by the great &s;o he was at fir&s;t unwilling to incur their re&s;entment by aims beyond his reach; he therefore lived in re|tirement, un&s;een and almo&s;t forgotten. But, while he thus &s;eemed de&s;irous of avoiding popularity, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was employing his &s;olitude in the &s;tudy of eloquence which was the readie&s;t means to obtain it: at length when he thought him&s;elf qualified to &s;erve his coun|try, he offered him&s;elf candidate for the quae&s;tor&s;hip to the army in Sardinia, which he readily obtained&punc; His valour, affability, and temperance in this office was remarked by all. The king of Numidia &s;ending a pre&s;ent of corn to the Romans, ordered his amba&s;|&s;adors to &s;ay, that it was entirely as a tribute to the virtues of Caius Gracchus. This the &s;enate treated with &s;corn, and ordered the amba&s;&s;adors to be di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed
<PB N="107" REF="118">
with contempt, as ignorant barbarians; which &s;o enflamed the re&s;entment of young Grac|chus, that he immediately came from the army, to complain of the indignity thrown upon his reputa|tion, and to offer him&s;elf for the tribune&s;hip of the people. It was then that the great found in this youth, who had been hitherto neglected upon ac|count of his age, a more formidable antagoni&s;t than even his brother had been. Notwith&s;tanding the warme&s;t oppo&s;ition from the &s;enate, he was declared tribune, by a very large majority, and he now pre|pared to run the &s;ame career which his brother had gone before him.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t effort was to have Popilius, one of the mo&s;t inveterate of his brother's enemies, cited before the people, who, rather than &s;tand the event of a trial, cho&s;e to go into voluntary bani&s;hment. He next procured an edict, granting the freedom of the city to the inhabitants of Latium; and, &s;oon after, to all the people on that &s;ide the Alps. He after|wards fixed the price of corn to a moderate &s;tandard, and procured a monthly di&s;tribution of it among the people. He then proceeded to an in&s;pection into the late corruptions of the &s;enate; in which the whole body being convicted of bribery, extortion, and the &s;afe of offices, for at that time a total degeneracy &s;eemed to have taken place, a law was made, tran&s;|ferring the power of judging corrupt magi&s;trates, from the &s;enate to the knights, which made a great altera|tion in the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Gracchus, by the&s;e means, being grown not only very popular, but very powerful in the &s;tate, was be|come an object, at which the &s;enate aimed all their re&s;entment But he &s;oon found the populace a faith|le&s;s and un&s;teady &s;upport; they began to withdraw all their confidence from him, and to place it upon Dru&s;us, a man in&s;idiou&s;ly &s;et up again&s;t him by the &s;enate. It was in vain, that he revived the Licinian
<PB N="108" REF="119">
law in their favour, and called up &s;everal of the inha|bitants of the different towns of Italy to his &s;upport; the &s;enate ordered them all to depart Rome, and even &s;ent one &s;tranger to pri&s;on, whom Gracchus had in|vited to live with him, and honoured with his table and friend&s;hip. To this indignity was &s;hortly after added a di&s;grace of a more fatal tendency; for &s;tand|ing for the tribune&s;hip a third time, he was rejected, it being &s;uppo&s;ed, that the officers, who&s;e duty it was to make the return, were bribed to reject him, though fairly cho&s;en.</P>
<P>It was now &s;een, that the fate of Gracchus was re|&s;olved on. Opimius, the con&s;ul, was not contented with the protection of all the &s;enate and the knights, with a numerous retinue of &s;laves and clients, but or|dered a body of Candians, that were mercenaries in the Roman &s;ervice, to follow and attend him. Thus guarded, and con&s;cious of the &s;uperiority of his forces, he in&s;ulted Gracchus wherever he met him, doing all in his power to produce a quarrel, in which he might have a pretence of di&s;patching his enemy in the fray. Gracchus avoided all recrimination, and, as if appri&s;ed of the con&s;ul's de&s;igns, would not even wear any kind of arms for his defence. His friend Flaccus, however, a zealous tribune, was not &s;o re|mi&s;s, but re&s;olved to oppo&s;e party again&s;t party, and for this purpo&s;e brought up &s;everal countrymen to Rome, who came under pretence of de&s;iring employ|ment. When the day for determining the controver&s;y was arrived, the two parties, early in the morning, attended at the Capitol, where, while the con&s;ul was &s;acrificing, according to cu&s;tom, one of the lictors taking up the entrails of the bea&s;t that was &s;lain, in order to remove them, could not forbear crying out to Fulvius and his party. <Q>You, ye factious citizens, make way for hone&s;t men.</Q> This in&s;ult &s;o pro|voked the party to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed, that they in&s;tantly fell upon him, and pierced him to death
<PB N="109" REF="120">
with the in&s;truments they u&s;ed in writing, which they then happened to have in their hands. This murder cau&s;ed a great di&s;turbance in the a&s;&s;embly; but particularly Gracchus, who &s;aw the con&s;equences that were likely to en&s;ue, reprimanded his party for giving his enemies &s;uch advantage over him; but now prepared to lead his followers to Mount Aven|tine. It was there he learned, that proclamation had been made by the con&s;uls, that whoever &s;hould bring either his head, or that of Flaccus, &s;hould receive its weight in gold as a reward. It was to no purpo&s;e, that he &s;ent the younge&s;t &s;on of Flaccus, who was yet a child, with propo&s;als for an accommodation. The &s;enate and the con&s;uls, who were &s;en&s;ible of their &s;u|periority, rejected all his offers, and re&s;olved to puni&s;h his offence with nothing le&s;s than death; and they offered pardon al&s;o to all who &s;hould leave him immediately. This produced the de&s;ired effect; the people fell from him by degrees, and left him with very inferior forces. In the mean time, Opi|mius, the con&s;ul, who thir&s;ted for &s;laughter, leading his forces up to Mount Aventine, fell in among the crowd with ungovernable fury: a terrible &s;laughter of the &s;carce re&s;i&s;ting multitude en&s;ued, and not le&s;s than three thou&s;and citizens were &s;lain upon the &s;pot. Flaccus attempted to find &s;helter in a ruinous cottage; but being di&s;covered, was &s;lain, with his elde&s;t &s;on. Gracchus, at fir&s;t, retired to the temple of Diana, where he was re&s;olved to die by his own hand; but was prevented by two of his faithful friends and fol|lowers, Pomponius and Lucinius, who forced him to &s;eek &s;afety by &s;light. From thence he made the be&s;t of his way to cro&s;s a bridge, that led from the city, &s;till attended by his two generous friends, and a Grecian &s;lave, who&s;e name was Philocrates. But his pur&s;uers &s;till pre&s;&s;ed upon him from behind, and when come to the foot of the bridge, he was obliged to turn and face the enemy. His two friends were
<PB N="110" REF="121">
&s;oon &s;lain, defending him again&s;t the crowd; and he was forced to take refuge, with his &s;lave, in a grove beyond the Tyber, which had long been dedicated to the Furies. Here finding him&s;elf &s;urrounded on every &s;ide, and no way left of e&s;caping, he prevailed upon his &s;lave to kill him, who immediately after killed him&s;elf, and fell down dead upon the both of his beloved ma&s;ter. The pur&s;uers &s;oon coming up, cut off the head of Gracchus, and placed it for a while as a trophy upon a &s;pear. Soon after, one Septimu|leius carrying it home, there, fir&s;t having &s;ecretly taken out the brain, he filled it with lead, in or|der to make it weigh heavier, and thus received of the con&s;ul &s;eventeen pounds of gold as his recom|pence.</P>
<P>Thus died Caius Gracchus, about ten years after his brother Tiberius, and &s;ix after he began to be active in the commonwealth. He is u&s;ually impeach|ed by hi&s;torians, as guilty of &s;edition; but from what we &s;ee of his character, the di&s;turbance of public tran|quility was rather owing to his oppo&s;ers than to him; &s;o that in&s;tead of calling the tumults of that time, the &s;edition of the Gracchi, we &s;hould rather call them the &s;edition of the &s;enate again&s;t the Grac|chi, &s;ince the efforts of the latter were made in vin|dication of a law, to which the &s;enate had a&s;&s;ented, and as the de&s;igns of the former were &s;upported by an extraneous armed power from the country, that had never before meddled in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the legi&s;la|tion, and who&s;e introduction gave a mo&s;t irreco|verable blow to the con&s;titution. Whether the Grac|chi were actuated by motives of ambition or of pa|trioti&s;m, in the promulgation of the&s;e laws, it is impo&s;&s;ible to determine; but certain it is, from what appears, that all ju&s;tice was on their &s;ide, and all in|jury on that of the &s;enate In fact, this body was now quite changed from that venerable a&s;&s;embly, which we have &s;een overthrowing Pyrrhus and Han|nibal,
<PB N="111" REF="122">
as much by their virtues as their arms. They were now only to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t of the people by their &s;uperior luxuries; and ruled the commonwealth by the weight of that authority, which is gained from riches, and a number of mer|cenary dependencies. All the venal and the ba&s;e were attached to them from motives of &s;elf-intere&s;t; and they who &s;till ventured to be independent, were borne down, and entirely lo&s;t in the infamous majo|rity. In &s;hort, the empire, at this period, came un|der the government of an hateful ari&s;tocracy; the tribunes, who were formerly accounted protectors of the people, becoming rich them&s;elves, and having no longer oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts from tho&s;e of the &s;enate, concurred in their oppre&s;&s;ions; &s;ince, as has been &s;aid, it was not now the &s;truggle between patricians and plebeians, who only nominally differed, but be|tween the rich and the poor. The lower orders of the &s;tate being by the&s;e means reduced to a degree of hopele&s;s &s;ubjection, in&s;tead of looking after liberty, only &s;ought for a leader; while the rich, with all the &s;u&s;picion of tyrants, terrified at the &s;lighte&s;t appear|ance of oppo&s;ition, entru&s;ted men with uncontroul|able power, from whom they had not &s;trength to withdraw it, when the danger was over. Thus both parts of the &s;tate concurred in giving up their free|dom; the fears of the &s;enate fir&s;t made the dictator, and the hatred of the people kept him in his office. Nothing can be more dreadful to a thinking mind than the government of Rome from this period, till it found refuge under the protection of Augu&s;tus.</P>

<P>Jugurtha was grand&s;on to the famous Ma&s;&s;ini&s;&s;a who &s;ided again&s;t Hannibal with Rome.

Where upon, Jugurtha, being &s;en&s;ible how much avarie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and inju&s;tice had crept into the &s;enate, &s;ent his am+ba&s;&s;adors with large pre&s;ents to Rome, who &s;o &s;uc+ce&s;sfully prevailed, that the &s;enate decreed him hal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the kingdom, which he had thus acquired by murde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and u&s;urpation, and &s;ent ten commi&s;&s;ioners to divide it between him and Adherbal. The commi&s;&s;ioners of whom Opimius, the murderer of Gracchus was one, willing to follow the example which the &s;enate had &s;et them, were al&s;o bribed to be&s;tow the mo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> rich and populous part of the kingdom upon the u&s;urper; who, for all that, re&s;olved to po&s;&s;e&s;s him|&s;elf of the whole.

This failing, he re&s;olved to throw off the ma&s;k;

and be&s;ieging Adherbal in Cirta, his capital, he at length got him into his power and murdered him. The people of Rome, who had &s;till &s;ome genero&s;ity remaining, unanimou&s;ly complained of this treache|ry, and procured a decree, that Jugurtha &s;hould be &s;ummoned in per&s;on before them, to give an account of all &s;uch as had accepted bribes. Jugurtha made no great difficulty in throwing him&s;elf upon the cle|mency of Rome; but giving the people no &s;atisfac|tion, he had orders to depart the city; and, in the mean time, Albanus, the con&s;ul, was &s;ent with an army to follow him; who giving up the direction of the army to Aulus, his brother, a per&s;on every way unqualified for the command, the Romans were compelled to hazard a battle upon di&s;advan|tageous terms; and the whole army, to avoid being cut to pieces, was obliged to pa&s;s under the yoke.</P>
<P>In this condition, Metellus, the &s;ucceeding con|&s;ul, found affairs upon his arrival in Numidia; of|ficers without confidence, an army without di&s;|cipline, and an enemy ever watchful and intriguing. However, by his great attention to bu&s;ine&s;s, and by an integrity that &s;huddered at corruption, he &s;oon began to retrieve the affairs of Rome, and the credit of the army. In the &s;pace of two years, Jugurtha was overthrown in &s;everal battles, forced out of his own dominions, and con&s;trained to beg a peace. Thus, all things promi&s;ed Metellus an ea&s;y and cer|tain victory, but he was fru&s;trated in his expecta|tions, by the intrigues of Caius Marius, his lieu|tenant, who came in to reap that harve&s;t of glory which the other's indu&s;try had &s;own. Caius Marius, was born in a village near Arpinium, of poor parents, who gained their living by their labour. As he had been bred up in a participation of their toils, his manners were as rude, as his countenance was fright|ful. He was a man of extraordinary &s;tature, incom|parable
<PB N="114" REF="125">
&s;trength, and undaunted bravery. When Metellus, as has been &s;aid, was obliged to &s;ollicit at Rome for a continuance of his command, Marius, who&s;e ambition knew no bounds, was re&s;olved to obtain it for him&s;elf, and thus gain all the glory of putting an end to the war. To that end he privately inveighed again&s;t Metellus by his emi&s;&s;aries at Rome; and having excited a &s;pirit of di&s;content again&s;t him, he had leave granted him to go to Rome, to &s;tand for the con&s;ul&s;hip him&s;elf, which he obtained, contrary to the expectation and intere&s;t of the nobles.</P>
<P>Marius being thus inve&s;ted with the &s;upreme power of managing the war, &s;hewed him&s;elf every way fit for the commi&s;&s;ion. His vigilance was equal to his valour, and he quickly made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the cities which Jugurtha had yet remaining in Numidia. This unfortunate prince finding him&s;elf unable to make oppo&s;ition &s;ingly, was obliged to have recour&s;e for a&s;&s;i&s;tance to Bocchus, king of Mauritania, to who&s;e daughter he was married. A battle &s;oon after en&s;ued, in which the Numidians &s;urpri&s;ed the Ro|man camp by night, and gained a temporary advan|tage. However, it was but of &s;hort continuance; for Marius &s;oon after overthrew them in two &s;ignal engagements, in one of which, not le&s;s than ninety thou&s;and of the African army were &s;lain. Bocchu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> now finding the Romans too powerful to be re&s;i&s;ted did not think it expedient to hazard his own crown&punc; to protect that of his ally; he therefore determined to make peace, upon whatever conditions he might obtain it; and accordingly &s;ent to Rome, imploring protection. The &s;enate received the amba&s;&s;ador with their u&s;ual haughtine&s;s, and, without comply+ing with their reque&s;t, granted the &s;uppliant, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their friend&s;hip, but their pardon. Notwith&s;tand+ing, after &s;ome time, he was given to under&s;tand that the delivering up of Jugurtha to the Romans
<PB N="115" REF="126">
would, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, conciliate their favour, and &s;often their re&s;entment At fir&s;t the pride of Bocchus &s;truggled again&s;t &s;uch a propo&s;al, but a few interviews with Sylla, who was quae&s;tor to Marius, reconciled him to this treacherous mea&s;ure. At length, therefore, Jugurtha was given up, being drawn into an ambu&s;cade, by the &s;pecious pretences of his ally, who deluded him by de&s;iring a confe|rence; and being made a pri&s;oner, he was carried by Marius to Rome, loaded with chains, a deplo|rable in&s;tance of bla&s;ted ambition. He did not long &s;urvive his overthrow, being condemned by the &s;e|nate to be &s;tarved to death in pri&s;on, a &s;hort time after he had adorned the triumph of the con|queror.</P>
<P>Marius, by this and two &s;ucceeding victories over the Gauls, having become very formidable to di&s;tant nations in war, became &s;oon after much more dan|gerous to his fellow-citizens in peace.</P>
<P>The &s;trength which he had given the popular par|ty, every day grew more con&s;picuous: and the Ita|lians being fru&s;trated in their aims of gaining the freedom of Rome, by the intrigues of the &s;enate, they re&s;olved upon obtaining by force, what was re|fu&s;ed them as a favour. This gave ri&s;e to the Social war, in which mo&s;t of the &s;tates of Italy entered into a confederacy again&s;t Rome, in order to ob|tain a redre&s;s of this, and all the re&s;t of their grievances.</P>
<P>After a lap&s;e of two years, this war having con|tinued to rage with doubtful &s;ucce&s;s, the &s;enate be|gan to reflect, that, whether conquered or conque|rors, the power of the Romans was in danger of be|ing totally de&s;troyed. In order therefore to &s;often their compliance by degrees, they began by giving the freedom of the city to &s;uch of the Italian &s;tates as had not revolted. They then offered it to &s;uch as would &s;oone&s;t lay down their arms. This unexpect|ed
<PB N="116" REF="127">
bounty had the de&s;ired effect; the allies, with mutual di&s;tru&s;t, offered each a &s;eparate treaty: the &s;enate took them one by one into favour, but gave the freedom of the city in &s;uch a manner, that, being empowered to vote not until all the other tribes had given their &s;uffrages, they had very little weight in the con&s;titution. In this manner they were made free, all but the Samnites and Lucanians, who &s;eem|ed excluded from the general compromi&s;e, as if to leave Sylla, who commanded again&s;t them, the glory of putting an end to the war: this he performed with great conduct, &s;torming their camps, overthrowing them in &s;everal battles, and obliging them to &s;ub|mit to &s;uch terms as the &s;enate were plea&s;ed to im|po&s;e.</P>
<P>This de&s;tructive war being concluded, which, as Paterculus &s;ays, con&s;umed above three hundred thou|&s;and of the flower of Italy, the &s;enate now began to think of turning their arms again&s;t Mithridates, the mo&s;t powerful and warlike monarch of the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>For this expedition Marius had long been prepar|ing, but Sylla, who now began to make a figure in the commonwealth, had intere&s;t enough to get Mari|us &s;et a&s;ide, and him&s;elf appointed to the expedition. Marius, however, tried all his arts with the people to get this appointment rever&s;ed, and at length pro|cured a law to be enacted, that the command of the army appointed to oppo&s;e Mithridates, was to be transferred from Sylla to Marius.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this, Marius immediately &s;ent down officers from Rome, to take command in his name. But, in&s;tead of obeying their orders, they fell upon and &s;lew the officers, and then entreated Sylla, that he would lead them directly to take &s;ignal vengeance upon all his enemies at Rome.</P>
<P>Accordingly, his &s;oldiers entered the city &s;word in hand, as a place taken by &s;torm. Marius and Sulpicius, at the head of a tumultuary body of their
<PB N="117" REF="128">
partizans, attempted to oppo&s;e their entrance; and the citizens them&s;elves, who feared the &s;ackage of the place, threw down &s;tones and tyles from the tops of the hou&s;es upon the intruders. So unequal a con|flict la&s;ted longer than could have been expected: at length, Marius and his party were obliged to &s;eek &s;afety by flight, after having vainly offered liberty to all the &s;laves, who would a&s;&s;i&s;t them in this emer|gency.</P>
<P>Sylla now finding him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the city, be|gan by modelling the laws &s;o as to favour his outrages. While Marius, driven out of Rome, and declared a public enemy, at the age of &s;eventy, was obliged to &s;ave him&s;elf, unattended and on foot, from the numerous pur&s;uits of tho&s;e who &s;ought his life. After having wandered for &s;ome time in this deplor|able condition, he found every day his dangers en|crea&s;e, and his pur&s;uers making nearer advances. In this di&s;tre&s;s he was obliged to conceal him&s;elf in the mar&s;hes of Minturnum, where he &s;pent the night up to his chin in a quagmire. At break of day he left this di&s;mal place, and made towards the &s;ea &s;ide, in hopes of finding a &s;hip to facilitate his e&s;cape; but being known and di&s;covered by &s;ome of the inhabi|tants, he was conducted to a neighbouring town with an halter round his neck, without cloaths, and, covered over with mud, was &s;ent to pri&s;on. The governor of the place, willing to conform to the or|ders of the &s;enate, &s;oon after &s;ent a Cimbrian &s;lave to di&s;patch him; but the barbarian no &s;ooner entered the dungeon for this purpo&s;e, but he &s;topt &s;hort, in|timidated by the dreadful vi&s;age and awful voice of the fallen general, who &s;ternly demanded, if he had the pre&s;umption to kill Caius Marius? The &s;lave, unable to reply, threw down his &s;word, and ru&s;hing back from the pri&s;on, cried out, that he found it im|po&s;&s;ible to kill him! The governor, con&s;idering the fear of the &s;lave as an omen in the unhappy exile's
<PB N="118" REF="129">
favour, gave him once more his freedom; and, com|mending him to his fortune, provided him with a &s;hip to convey him from Italy. He from thence made the be&s;t of his way to the i&s;land of Aenaria, and &s;ailing onward, was forced by a tempe&s;t on the coa&s;t of Sicily. There a Roman quae&s;tor, who happened to be at the &s;ame place, re&s;olved to &s;eize him; by which he lo&s;t &s;ixteen of his crew, who were killed in their endeavours to cover his retreat to the &s;hip. He afterwards landed in Africa, near Carthage, and went, in a melancholy manner, to place him&s;elf among&s;t the ruins of that de&s;olated place. He &s;oon, however, had orders from the praetor, who governed there, to retire. Marius, who remembered his hav|ing once &s;erved this very man, when in nece&s;&s;ity, could not &s;uppre&s;s his &s;orrow, at finding ingratitude in every quarter of the would; and preparing to obey, de&s;ired the me&s;&s;enger to tell his ma&s;ter, that he had &s;een Marius &s;itting among the ruins of Carthage, in|timating the greatne&s;s of his own fall, by the de&s;ola|tion that was found him. He then embarked once more, and, not knowing where to land without en|countering an enemy, &s;pent the winter at &s;ea, ex|pecting every hour, the return of a me&s;&s;enger from his &s;on, whom he had &s;ent to &s;ollicit protection from an African prince, who&s;e name was Mand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;tal. After long expectation, in&s;tead of the me&s;&s;enger, his &s;on him&s;elf arrived, having e&s;caped from the inho&s;|pitable court of that monarch, where he had been kept, not as a friend, but a pri&s;oner, and had re|turned ju&s;t time enough to prevent his father from &s;haring the &s;ame fate. It was in this &s;ituation, that they were informed that Cinna, one of their party, who had remained at Rome, had re&s;tored their af|fairs, and headed a large army of the Italian &s;tates in his cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Nor was it long before they joined their forces, and pre&s;ented them&s;elves at the gates of Rome. Sylla
<PB N="119" REF="130">
was at that time ab&s;ent in his command again&s;t Mi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hridates, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e Cinna marched into the city, ac|companied by his guards; but Marius &s;topped, and refu&s;ed to enter, alledging, that, having been ba|ni&s;hed by a public decree, it was nece&s;&s;ary to have another to authorize his return. It was thus that he de&s;ired to give his meditated cruelties the appearance of ju&s;tice; and, while he was about to de&s;troy thou|&s;ands, to pretend an implicit veneration for the laws. In pur&s;uance of his de&s;ire, an a&s;&s;embly of the people being called, they began to rever&s;e his bani&s;hment; but they had &s;carce gone through three of the tribes, when, incapable of containing his de&s;ire of revenge, he entered the city at the head of his guards, and ma&s;&s;acred all that had ever been obnoxious to him, without remor&s;e or pity. Several who &s;ought to pro|pitiate the tyrant's rage, were murdered by his com|mand in his pre&s;ence; many even of tho&s;e who had never offended him were put to death; and, at la&s;t, even his own officers never approached him but with error. Having in this manner puni&s;hed his enemies, be next abrogated all the laws which were made by his rival, and then made him&s;elf con&s;ul with Cinna. Thus gratified in his two favourite pa&s;&s;ions, venge|ance and ambition, having once &s;aved his country, and now deluged it with blood; at la&s;t, as if willing to crown the pile of &s;laughter which he had made, with his own body, he died the month after, aged &s;eventy, not without &s;u&s;picion of having ha&s;tened his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the&s;e accounts were brought to Sylla, who was &s;ent again&s;t Mithridates, and who was performing many &s;ignal &s;ervices again&s;t him; but conc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uding a peace with that monarch, he re&s;olv|ed to return home to take revenge of his enemies at Rome.</P>
<P>In the mean time, nothing could intimidate Cinna from making preparations to repel his opponent. Be|ing
<PB N="120" REF="131" MS="y">
joined by Carbo, who was now elected in the room of Valerius, who had been &s;lain, together with young Marius, who inherited all the abilities and the ambition of his father, he determined to &s;end over part of the forces he had rai&s;ed into Dalmatia, to oppo&s;e Sylla before he entired Italy. Some troops were accordingly embarked; but the&s;e being di&s;per&s;ed by a &s;torm, the re&s;t, that had not yet put to &s;ea, ab|&s;olutely refu&s;ed to go. Upon this, Cinna, quite fu|rious at their di&s;obedience, ru&s;hed forward to per|&s;ade them to their duty In the mean time, one of the mo&s;t mutinous of the &s;oldiers being &s;truck by an officer, returned the blow, and was apprehended for his crime. This ill-timed &s;everity produced a tu|mult and a mutiny through the whole army; and while Cinna did all he could to prevent or appea&s;e it, he was run through the body by one of the crowd.</P>
<P>Scipio, the con&s;ul, who commanded again&s;t Sylla, was &s;oon after allured by propo&s;als for coming to a treaty: but a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms being agreed upon, Sylla's &s;oldiers went into the oppo&s;ite camp, di&s;play|ing tho&s;e riches which they had acquired in their ex|peditions, and offering to participate with their fel|low-citizens, in ca&s;e they changed their party. Ac|cordingly, the whole army declared unanimou&s;ly for Sylla; and Scipio &s;carce knew that he was for|&s;aken and depo&s;ed, till he was informed of it by a par|ty of the enemy, who, entering his tent, made him and his &s;on their pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>In this manner, both factions, exa&s;perated to the highe&s;t degree, and expecting no mercy on either part, gave vent to their fury in &s;everal engagements The forces on the &s;ide of young Marius, who now &s;ucceeded his father in command, were the mo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> numerous, but tho&s;e of Sylla better united and mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> under &s;ubordination.

<P>UPON death of Sylla, the jealou&s;ies of Pompey and Cra&s;&s;us, the two mo&s;t powerful men in the em|pire, began to excite fre&s;h di&s;&s;en&s;ions. Pompey was the mo&s;t beloved general, and Cra&s;&s;us was the riche&s;t man in Rome.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t opportunity that was afforded of di&s;cover|ing their mutual jealou&s;y, was upon the di&s;banding their troops, with which they had conquered. Neither cho&s;e to begin; &s;o that the mo&s;t fatal con&s;e|quences threatened from their di&s;&s;en&s;ion: but, at length, Cra&s;&s;us, &s;tifling his re&s;entment, laid down his command; and the other followed his example immediately after. The next trial between them was, who &s;hould be foremo&s;t in obtaining the favour of the people.

citizens for near three months. Pompey, on the other hand, laboured to abrogate the laws made again&s;t the people's authority by Sylla: he re&s;tored the power of judging to the knights, which had been formerly granted them by Gracchus; and gave back to the tribunes of the people all their former privi|leges. It was thus that each gave his private aims a public appearance; &s;o that what was in reality ambi|tion in both, took with one the name of liberality, with the other that of freedom.</P>
<P>An expedition, in which Pompey cleared the Me|diterranean, which was infe&s;ted by pirates, having added greatly to his reputation, the tribunes of the people hoped it would be ea&s;ier to advance their fa|vourite &s;till higher: wherefore Manilius, one of the number, preferred a law, that all the armies of the empire, with the government of all A&s;ia, together with the management of the war, which was renew|ed again&s;t Mithridates, &s;hould be committed to him alone. The law pa&s;&s;ed with little oppo&s;ition, and the decree was confirmed by all the tribes of the people</P>
<P>Being thus appointed to the command of that im|portant war, he immediately departed for A&s;ia, hav|ing made the proper preparations towards forwarding the campaign. Mithridates had been obliged by Lu|cullus to take refuge in Le&s;&s;er Armenia, and thither that general was preparing to follow him, when his whole army abandoned him, &s;o that it remained for Pompey to terminate the war, which he effected with great ea&s;e and expedition, adding a large extent of dominion to the Roman empire, and returning to Rome in triumph at the head of his conquering army.</P>
<P>But all the victories of Pompey, rather &s;erved to heighten the glory, than to encrea&s;e the power of Rome; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ey only made it a more glaring object of ambition, and expo&s;ed its liberties to greater danger.

jealou&s;y to his own advantage. This celebrated man was nephew to Marius, by the female line, and de&s;cended from one of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious families in Rome: he had already mounted by the regular gra|dations of office; having been quae&s;tor, aedile, grand pontiff, and praetor in Spain. Being de&s;cended from popular ance&s;tors, he warmly e&s;pou&s;ed the &s;ide of the people, and &s;hortly after the death of Sylla pro|cured tho&s;e whom he had bani&s;hed to be recalled. He had all along declared for the populace again&s;t the &s;enate, and by this became their mo&s;t favourite magi&s;trate. This con&s;ummate &s;tate&s;man began fir&s;t, by offering his &s;ervices to Pompey, promi&s;ing him his aid in having all his acts pa&s;&s;ed, notwith&s;tanding the &s;enate's oppo&s;ition.

A com|bination was thus formed, by which they three agreed, that nothing &s;hould be done in the common|wealth, but what received their mutual concurrence and approbation. This was called the Fir&s;t Trium|virate, by which we find the con&s;titution weakened by a new intere&s;t, that had not hitherto taken place in the government, very different from that either of the &s;enate or the people, and yet dependent on both.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX. From the beginning of the fir&s;t Triumvirate to the death of Pompey.  <MILESTONE REND="inBrackets" UNIT="U.C." N="694"> </HEAD> 
<P>THE fir&s;t thing Cae&s;ar did, upon being taken into the triumvirate, was to avail him&s;elf of the in|tere&s;t of his confederates to obtain the con&s;ul&s;hip. The &s;enate had &s;till &s;ome &s;mall influence left; and, though they were obliged to concur in chu&s;ing him, yet they gave him for a colleague, on Bibulus, who they &s;uppo&s;ed would be a check upon his power; but the oppo&s;ition was too &s;trong for even &s;uperior abili|ties to re&s;i&s;t it; &s;o that Bibulus, after a &s;light attempt in favour of the &s;enate, remained inactive. Cae&s;ar began his &s;chemes for empire, by ingratiating him|&s;elf with the people: he procured a law for divid|ing certain lands in Campania, among &s;uch of the poor citizens, as had at lea&s;t three children. This propo&s;al was ju&s;t enough in it&s;elf, and only criminal from the views of the propo&s;er.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;trengthened him&s;elf at home, he next deliberated with his confederates, about &s;haring the foreign provinces of the empire between them. The partition was &s;oon made: Pompey cho&s;e Spain for his own part; for being fatigued with conque&s;t, and &s;atiated with military fame, he was willing to take his plea&s;ures at Rome. Cra&s;&s;us cho&s;e Syria for his part of the empire; which province, as it had hitherto enriched the generals who had &s;ubdued it would, he hoped, gratify him in this his mo&s;t fa|vourite pur&s;uit. To Cae&s;ar was left the provinces o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Gaul; compo&s;ed of many fierce and powerful na|tions, mo&s;t of them un&s;ubdued, and the re&s;t only profe&s;&s;ing a nominal &s;ubjection. Wherefore, as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was rather appointing him to conquer than command&punc;
<PB N="129" REF="140">
this government was granted him for five years; as if, by its continuance, to compen&s;ate for its danger.</P>
<P>It would be impo&s;&s;ible, in this narrow compa&s;s, to enumerate all the battles Cae&s;ar fought, and the &s;tates he &s;ubdued, in his expeditions into Gaul and Britain, which continued eight years. The Helve|tians were the fir&s;t that were brought into &s;ubjection, with the lo&s;s of near two hundred thou&s;and men; tho&s;e who remained after the carnage, were &s;ent, by Cae&s;ar, in &s;afety to the fore&s;ts, from whence they had i&s;&s;ued. The Germans, with Ariovi&s;tus at their head, were next cut off, to the number of eighty thou&s;and; their monarch him&s;elf narrowly e&s;caping in a little boat acro&s;s the Rhine. The Belgae were cut off with &s;uch great &s;laughter, that mar&s;hes and deep rivers were rendered pa&s;&s;able from the heaps of &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ain. The Nervians, who were the mo&s;t warlike of tho&s;e barbarous nations, made head for a &s;hort time, and fell upon the Romans with &s;uch fury, that their army was in danger of being utterly routed; but Cae&s;ar him&s;elf ha&s;tily catching up a buckler, ru&s;hed through his army into the mid&s;t of the enemy; by which means, he &s;o turned the fate of the day, that the barbarians were all cut off to a man. The Celtic Gauls, who were powerful at &s;ea, were next brought under &s;ubjection. After them, the Suevi, the Me|napii, and all the nations from the Mediterranean to the Briti&s;h &s;ea. From thence, &s;timulated by the de|&s;ire of conque&s;t, he cro&s;&s;ed over into Britain, upon pretence, that the natives had furni&s;hed his enemies with continual &s;upplies. Upon approaching the &s;hores, he found them covered with men to oppo&s;e his landing, and his forces were in danger of being driven back, till the &s;tandard bearer of the tenth le|gion boldly leaped a&s;hore, and, being well a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Cae&s;ar, the natives were put to flight. The Bri|tons, being terrified at Cae&s;ar's power, &s;ent to de&s;ire

a peace, which was granted them, and &s;ome ho&s;tage delivered. A &s;torm, however, &s;oon after de&s;troyin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> great part of his fleet, they re&s;olved to take advan+tage of the di&s;a&s;ter, and marched again&s;t him with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> powerful army.

<P>While Cae&s;ar was thus encrea&s;ing his reputatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and riches abroad, Pompey, who remained all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> time in Rome, &s;teadily co-operated with his ambi+tion, and advanced his intere&s;ts, while he vainly &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+po&s;ed he was forwarding his own.

<PB N="131" REF="142">
in which he was involved, he fell a &s;acrifice to his own ra&s;hne&s;s, being killed, bravely defending him&s;elf to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>Cae&s;ar, who now began to be &s;en&s;ible of the jeal|ou&s;ies of Pompey, took occa&s;ion to &s;olicit for the con&s;ul&s;hip, together with a prolongation of his go|vernment in Gaul, de&s;irous of trying whether Pom|pey would thwart or promote his preten&s;ions. In this, Pompey &s;eemed to be quite inactive; but, at the &s;ame time, privately employed two of his crea|tures, who alledged in the &s;enate, that the laws did not permit a per&s;on that was ab&s;ent, to offer him&s;elf as a candidate for that high office. Pompey's view in this was to allure Cae&s;ar from his government, in order to &s;tand for the con&s;ul&s;hip in per&s;on. Cae&s;ar, however, perceiving his artifice, cho&s;e to remain in his province; convinced, that while he headed &s;uch an army as was now devoted to his intere&s;ts, he could, at any time, give laws as well as magi&s;trates to the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The &s;enate, which were now devoted to Pompey, becau&s;e he had for &s;ome time attempted to defend them from the encroachments of the people, order|ed two legions which were in Cae&s;ar's army, be|longing to Pompey, home, as it was pretended, to oppo&s;e the Parthians, but, in reality, to dimini&s;h Cae&s;ar's power. Cae&s;ar ea&s;ily &s;aw their motive; but, as his plans were not yet ready for execution, he &s;ent them home, in pur&s;uance of the orders of the &s;enate, having previou&s;ly attached the officers to him with benefits, and the &s;oldiers with a bounty. The next &s;tep the &s;enate took, was to recall Cae&s;ar from his go|vernment, as his time was now very near expiring. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut Curio, his friend in the &s;enate, propo&s;ed that Cae&s;ar &s;hould not leave his army, till Pompey had &s;et him the example. This for a while perplexed Pompey; however, during the debate, one of the &s;enate declaring that Cae&s;ar was pa&s;t the Alps, and
<PB N="132" REF="143">
marching with his whole army directly toward Rome, the con&s;ul immediately quitting the &s;enate, went with his colleague forth from the city to an hou&s;e where Pompey at that time re&s;ided. He there pre&s;ented him with a &s;word, commanding him to march again&s;t Cae&s;ar, and fight in defence of the commonwealth. Pompey declared he was ready to obey; but with an air of pretended moderation add|ed, that it was only in ca&s;e more gentle expedients could not be employed.</P>
<P>Cae&s;ar, who was in&s;tructed in all that pa&s;&s;ed, by his partizans at Rome, though he was &s;till in Gaul, was willing to give his aims all the appearance of ju&s;tice. He agreed to lay down his employment when Pompey &s;hould do the &s;ame. But the &s;enate rejected all his propo&s;itions, blindly confident of their own power, and relying on the a&s;&s;urances of Pompey. Cae&s;ar &s;till unwilling to come to an open rupture with the &s;tate, at la&s;t was content to a&s;k the government of Illyria, with two legions; but this al&s;o was refu&s;ed him. Now, therefore, finding all hopes of an accommodation fruitle&s;s, and con&s;cious, if not of the goodne&s;s of his cau&s;e, at lea&s;t of the goodne&s;s of his troops, he began to draw them down towards the confines of Italy, and, pa&s;&s;ing the Alps with his third legion, &s;topt at Ravenna, a city of Ci&s;alpine Gaul, from whence he once more wrote a letter to the con&s;uls, declaring, that he was ready to re&s;ign all command in ca&s;e Pompey did &s;o too. On the other hand, the &s;enate decreed, that Cae&s;ar &s;hould lay down his government, and di&s;band his forces within a limited time; and, if he refu&s;ed obedience, that he &s;hould be declared an enemy to the common|wealth.</P>
<P>Cae&s;ar, however, &s;eemed no way di&s;turbed at the&s;e violent proceedings; the night before his intended expedition into Italy, he &s;at down to table chearfully conver&s;ing with his friends on &s;ubjects of literature

and philo&s;ophy, and apparently di&s;engaged from every ambitious concern. After &s;ome time, ri&s;ing up, he de&s;ired the company to make them&s;elves chear|ful in his ab&s;ence, and that he would be with them in a moment: in the mean time, having ordered his chariot to be prepared, he immediately &s;et out, at|tended by a few friends, for Arminium, a city upon the confines of Italy, whither he had di&s;patched a part of his army the morning before. This journey by night, which was very &s;atiguing, he performed with great diligence, &s;ometimes walking, and &s;ome|times on hor&s;eback, till at the break of day he came up with his army, which con&s;i&s;ted of about five thou|&s;and men, near the Rubicon, a little river which &s;e|perates Italy from Gaul, and which terminated the limits of his command. The Romans had ever been taught to con&s;ider this river as the &s;acred boun|dary of their dome&s;tic empire; Cae&s;ar, therefore, when he advanced at the head of his army to the &s;ide of the river, &s;topt &s;hort upon the bank, as if impre&s;t with terror at the greatne&s;s of his enterprize. He pondered for &s;ome time in fixed melancholy, looking upon the river, and debating with him&s;elf whether he &s;hould venture in: "If I pa&s;s this river," &s;ays he to one of his generals who &s;tood by him, <Q>what mi|&s;eries &s;hall I bring upon my country! and, if now I &s;top &s;hort, I am undone.</Q> Thus &s;aying, and re&s;uming all his former alacrity, he plunged in, cry|ing out, that the die was ca&s;t, and all was now over, his &s;oldiers followed him with equal promptitude, and quickly arriving at Arminium, made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the place without any re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>This unexpected enterprize excited the utmo&s;t ter|rors in Rome, every one imagining that Cae&s;ar was leading his army to lay the city in ruins. At one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">me were to be &s;een the citizens flying into the country for &s;afety, and the inhabitants of the coun|try coming up to &s;eek for &s;helter in Rome.

this univer&s;al confu&s;ion, Pompey felt all that repent|ance and &s;elf-condemnation which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e from the remembrance of having advanced his rival to his pre&s;ent pitch of power: wherever he ap|peared, many of his former friends were ready to tax him with his &s;upinene&s;s, and &s;arca&s;tically to reproach his ill-grounded pre&s;umption. "Where is now," cried Favonius, a ridiculous &s;enator of his party, <Q>the army that is to ri&s;e at your command? Let us &s;ee if it will appear by &s;tamping.</Q> Cato reminded him of the many warnings he had given him; which, however, as he was continually boding no|thing but calamities, Pompey might very ju&s;tly he excu&s;ed from attending to. But being at length wearied with the&s;e reproaches, which were offered under colour of advice, he did all that lay in his power to encourage and confirm his followers: he told them that they &s;hould not want an army, for that he would be their leader; he confe&s;t, indeed, that he had all along mi&s;taken Cae&s;ar's aims, judging of them only from what they ought to be; however, if his f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iends were &s;till in&s;pired with the love of freedom, they might yet enjoy it in whatever place their nece&s;|&s;ities &s;hould happen to conduct them. He let them know that their affairs were in a very promi&s;ing &s;itu|ation, that his two lieutenants were at the head of a very con&s;iderable army in Spain, compo&s;ed of vete|ran troops that had made the conque&s;t of the Ea&s;t; be&s;ides the&s;e, there were infinite re&s;ources both in A&s;ia and Africa, together with the &s;uccours they were &s;ure to expect from all the kingdoms that were in alliance with Rome. This &s;peech &s;erved, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to revive the hopes of the confederacy. The greate&s;t part of the &s;enate, his own private friends and dependents, together with all tho&s;e who expect|ed to make their fortunes in his cau&s;e, agreed to fol|low him. Being in no capacity to re&s;i&s;t Cae&s;ar a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Rome, he re&s;olved to lead his forces to Capua, where
<PB N="135" REF="146">
he commanded the two legions that &s;erved under Cae&s;ar in Gaul.</P>
<P>Cae&s;ar, in the mean time, after having vainly at|tempted to bring Pompey to an accommodation, re|&s;olved to pur&s;ue him into Capua before he could col|lect his forces. Accordingly, he marched on to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the cities that lay between him and his rival, not regarding Rome, which he knew would full of cour&s;e to the conqueror.</P>
<P>Corfinium was the fir&s;t city that attempted to &s;top the rapidity of his march. It was defended by Do|mitius, who had been appointed by the &s;enate to &s;uc|ceed him in Gaul, and was garri&s;oned by twenty co|horts which were levied in the countries adjacent: Cae&s;ar, however, quickly inve&s;ted it; and, though Domitius &s;ent frequently to Pompey, exhorting him to come and rai&s;e the &s;iege, he was at la&s;t obliged to endeavour to e&s;cape privately. His intentions hap|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ned to be divulged, the garri&s;on were re&s;olved to con&s;ult their own &s;afety by delivering him up to the be&s;iegers. Cae&s;ar readily accepted their offers, but kept his men from immediately entering into the town. After &s;ome time, Lentulus, the con&s;ul, who was one of the be&s;ieged, came out to implore for|givene&s;s for him&s;elf and the re&s;t of his confederates, putting Cae&s;ar in mind of their ancient friend&s;hip, and acknowledging the many favours he had received at his hands To this, Cae&s;ar, who would not wait the conclu&s;ion of his &s;peech, generou&s;ly replied, that he came into Italy not to injure the liberties of Rome and its citizens, but to re&s;tore them. This humane reply being quickly carried into the city, the &s;enators, and the knights, with their children and &s;ome officers of the garri&s;on, came out to claim the conqueror's protection, who, ju&s;t glancing at their ingratitude, gave them their liberty, with permi&s;&s;ion to go where&s;oever they &s;hould think proper. But while he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the leaders, he, upon this, as upon
<PB N="136" REF="147">
all other occa&s;ions, took care to attach the common &s;oldiers to his own intere&s;t, &s;en&s;ible that he might &s;tand in need of an army; but that, while he lived, his army could never &s;tand in need of a com|mander.</P>
<P>Pompey, who was unable to continue in Rome, having intelligence of what pa&s;&s;ed upon this occa&s;ion, immediately retreated to Brundu&s;ium, where he re|&s;olved to &s;tand a &s;iege to retard the enemy until the forces of the empire &s;hould be united to oppo&s;e him. His aim in this &s;ucceeded to his wi&s;h, and after hav|ing employed Cae&s;ar for &s;ome time in a fruitle&s;s &s;iege, he privately pa&s;&s;ed his forces over to Dyracchium, where the con&s;ul had levied a body of forces for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. However, though he made good his e&s;cape, he was compelled to leave the whole king|dom of Italy at the mercy of his rival, without either a town or an army that had &s;trength to oppo&s;e his prog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s.</P>
<P>Cae&s;ar finding he could not follow Pompey for want of &s;hipping, went back to Rome, to take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the public trea&s;ures, which his opponent, by a mo&s;t unaccountable over-&s;ight, had neglected taking with him. However, upon his coming up to the door of the trea&s;ury, Metellus, the tribune, who guarded it, refu&s;ed to let him pa&s;s; but Cae&s;ar, with more than u&s;ual emotion, laying his hand upon his &s;word, threatened to &s;trike him dead; <Q>And know, young man,</Q> cried he, <Q>that it is ea&s;ier to do this than to &s;ay it.</Q> This menace had its effect; Metellus retired, and Cae&s;ar took out of the trea&s;ury to the amount of three thou&s;and pound weight of gold, be&s;ides an immen&s;e quantity of &s;ilver.</P>
<P>Having thus provided for continuing the war, he departed from Rome, re&s;olved to &s;ubdue Pompey's lieutenants, Afranius and Petreius, who had been long in Spain at the head of a veteran army, com|po&s;ed of the choice&s;t legions of the empire, who had
<PB N="137" REF="148">
been ever victorious under all its commanders. Cae&s;ar, however, who knew the abilities of its two pre&s;ent generals, joco&s;ely &s;aid as he was preparing to go thither, that he went to fight an army without a general, and, upon conquering it, would return to fight a general without an army.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t conflict which he had with Afranius and Petreius, was rather unfavourable. It was &s;ought near the city of Herda, and both &s;ides claimed the honour of the victory. But by various &s;tratagems he reduced them at la&s;t to &s;uch extremity of hunger and drought, that they were obliged to yield at di&s;cre|tion. Clemency was his favourite virtue; he di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed them all with the kinde&s;t profe&s;&s;ions, and &s;ent them home to Rome loaden with &s;hame and obliga|tions to publi&s;h his virtues, and confirm the affec|tions of his adherents. Thus, in the &s;pace of about forty days, he became ma&s;ter of all Spain, and re|turned again victorious to Rome. The citizens up|on this occa&s;ion received him with fre&s;h demon&s;tra|tions of joy, and created him dictator and con&s;ul; but the fir&s;t of the&s;e offices he laid down after he had held it but eleven days.</P>
<P>While Cae&s;ar was thus employed, Pompey was equally active in making preparations in Epirus and Greece to oppo&s;e him. All the monarchs of the Ea&s;t had declared in his favour, and &s;ent very large &s;upplies. He was ma&s;ter of nine effective Italian legions, and had a fleet of five hundred large &s;hips under the conduct of Bibulus, an active and expe|rienced commander. Added to the&s;e, he was &s;up|plied with large &s;ums of money, and all the nece&s;&s;a|ries for an army, from the tributary provinces round him. He had attacked Anthony and Dolabella, who commanded for Cae&s;ar in that part of the empire, with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that the former was obliged to fly, and the latter was taken pri&s;oner. Crowds of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed citizens and nobles from Rome came
<PB N="138" REF="149">
every day to join him. He had at one time above two hundred &s;enators in his camp, among whom were Cicero and Cato, who&s;e approbation of his cau&s;e was equivalent to an army.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e preparations, Cae&s;ar &s;hipped off five of his twelve legions, at Brundu&s;ium, and weighing anchor, fortunately &s;teered through th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mid&s;t of his enemies, timing it &s;o well that he mad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his pa&s;&s;age in one day.

<P>Pompey had been rai&s;ing &s;upplies in Macedon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> when fir&s;t informed of Cae&s;ar's landing upon the coa&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Epirus: he now, therefore, re&s;olved immediately <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> march to Dyracchium, in order to cover that place fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Cae&s;ar's attempts, as all his ammunition and prov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+&s;ions were depo&s;ited there.

<P>Cae&s;ar had now waited &s;ome time with extreme impatience for the coming up of the remainder of his army; and even ventured out alone in an open fi&s;her boat to ha&s;ten its arrival, but he was driven back by a &s;torm. However, his di&s;appointment was
<PB N="139" REF="150">
&s;oon relieved, by an information of the landing of the troops he had long expected at Appolionia, from whence they were approaching, under the conduct of Anthony and Calenus, to join him; he, therefore, decamped in order to meet them; and prevent Pom|pey with his army from engaging them on their march, as he lay on that &s;ide of the river, where the &s;uccours had been obliged to come on &s;hore.</P>
<P>Pompey being compelled to retreat, led his forces to A&s;paragus, nigh Dyracchium, where he was &s;ure of being &s;upplied with every thing nece&s;&s;ary for his army, by the numerous fleets which he employed along the coa&s;ts of Epirus: there he pitched his cam upon a tongue of land (as mariners expre&s;s it) that jutted into the &s;ea, where al&s;o was a &s;mall &s;hel|ter for &s;hips, where few winds could annoy them: in this place being mo&s;t advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated, he immediately began to entrench his camp; which Cae&s;ar perceiving, and finding that he was not like|ly &s;oon to quit &s;o advantageous a po&s;t, began to en|trench al&s;o behind him. And as all beyond Pom|pey's camp, towards the land &s;ide, was hilly and &s;teep; he built redoubts upon the hills, &s;tretching round from &s;hore to &s;hore; and then cau&s;ed lines of communication to be drawn from hill to hill, by which he blocked up the camp of the enemy. He hoped by this blockade, to force his opponent to a battle; which he ardently de&s;ired, and which the other with equal indu&s;try declined. Thus both &s;ides continued for &s;ome time employed in de&s;igns and &s;tratagems, the one to annoy and the other to defend. Cae&s;ar's men daily carried on their works to &s;traiten the enemy; tho&s;e of Pompey did the &s;ame to enlarge them&s;elves, having the advantage of numbers, and &s;everely galled the enemy by their &s;lingers and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ers. Cae&s;ar, however, was indefatigable; he cau&s;ed blinds or man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elets to be made of &s;kins of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s, to cover his men while at work; he cut off all
<PB N="140" REF="151">
the water that &s;upplied the enemy's camp, and forage from the hor&s;es; &s;o that there remained no more &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence for them. But Pompey at la&s;t re&s;olved to break through his lines, and gain &s;ome other part of the country more convenient for encampment. Ac|cordingly, having informed him&s;elf of the condition of Cae&s;ar's fortifications from &s;ome de&s;erters who came over to him, he ordered his light infantry and archers on board his &s;hips, with directions to attack Cae&s;ar's entrenchments by &s;ea, where they were lea&s;t defended. This was done with &s;uch effect, that though Cae&s;ar and his officers u&s;ed their utmo&s;t en|deavours to hinder Pompey's de&s;igns, yet, by means of reiterated attempts, he at la&s;t effected his purpo&s;e of extricating his army from his former camp, and of encamping in another place by the &s;ea, where he had the conveniency of forage and &s;hipping al&s;o. Cae&s;ar being thus fru&s;trated in his views of blocking up the enemy, and perceiving the lo&s;s he had &s;u&s;tained, re|&s;olved at la&s;t to force Pompey to a battle, though upon di&s;advantageous terms. The engagement be|gan by attempting to cut off a legion which was po&s;ted in a wood, and this brought on a general battle. The conflict was for &s;ome time carried on with great ardour, and with equal fortune; but Cae&s;ar's army being intangled in the entrenchments of the old camps lately abandoned, began to fall into di&s;order; upon which, Pompey pre&s;&s;ing his advan|tage, they at la&s;t fled with great precipitation. Great numbers peri&s;hed in the trenches and on the banks of the river, or were pre&s;&s;ed to death by their fel|lows. Pompey pur&s;ued his &s;ucce&s;&s;es to the very camp of Cae&s;ar: but either &s;urpri&s;ed with the &s;ud|denne&s;s of his victory, or fearful of an ambu&s;cade, he withdrew his troops into his own camp, and thus lo&s;t an opportunity of &s;ecuring his victory.</P>
<P>After this defeat, which was by no means deci|&s;ive, Cae&s;ar marched&punc; with all his forces united into
<PB N="141" REF="152">
one body, directly to Gomphi, a town in the pro|vince of The&s;&s;aly. But the news of his defeat at Dyrac|chium had reached this place before him; the inha|bitants, therefore, who had before promi&s;ed him obe|dience, now changed their minds; and, with a de|gree of ba&s;ene&s;s, equal to their imprudence, &s;hut their gates again&s;t him. Cae&s;ar was not to be injured with impunity; wherefore, having repre&s;ented to his &s;oldiers the great advantage of forcing a place &s;o very rich, he ordered the machines for &s;caling to be got ready; and cau&s;ing an a&s;&s;ault to be made, pro|ceeded with &s;uch vigour, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat, notwith&s;tanding the great height of the walls, the town was taken in a few hours time. Cae&s;ar left it to be plundered, and, without delaying his march, went forward to Me|tropolis, another town of the &s;ame province, which yielded at his approach. By this means, he &s;oon be|came po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all The&s;&s;aly, except Lari&s;&s;a, which was garri&s;oned by Scipio, with his legion, who com|manded for Pompey. During this interval, Pom|pey's officers continually &s;oliciting their commander to come to a battle, and ince&s;&s;antly tea&s;ing him with importunities to engage; he, at length, re&s;olved, to renounce his own judgment, in compliance with tho&s;e about him; and to give up all &s;chemes of pru|dence for tho&s;e dictated by avarice and pa&s;&s;ion. Wherefore advancing into The&s;&s;aly, within a few days after the taking of Gomphi, he drew down upon the plains of Phar&s;alia, where he was joined by Scipio, his lieutenant, with the troops under his command. There he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed the coming up of Cae&s;ar, re&s;olved upon engaging, and upon deciding the fate of the kingdoms at a &s;ingle battle.</P>
<P>Cae&s;ar had employed all his art for &s;ome time in founding the in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">inations of his men, and finding his array once more re&s;olute and vigorous, he cau&s;ed them to advance towards the plains of Phar&s;alia, where Pom|pey

The flight began among the &s;trangers, though Pompey's right wing &s;till valiantly maintained their ground. Cae&s;ar, however, being convinced that the victory was certain, with his u&s;ual clemency, cried cut to pur&s;ue the &s;trangers, but to &s;pare the Romans; upon which they all laid down their arms and receiv|ed quarter. The greate&s;t &s;laughter was among the auxiliaries, who fled on all quarters, but principally went for &s;afety to the camp. The battle had now la&s;ted from the break of day till noon, the weather being extremely hot; neverthele&s;s, the conquerors did not remit their ardour, being encouraged by the example of their general, who thought his victory not complete till he was ma&s;ter of the enemy's camp. Accordingly, marching on foot at their head, he call|ed upon them to follow and &s;trike the deci&s;ive blow. The cohorts, which were left to defend the camp, for &s;ome time made a formidable re&s;i&s;tance; particu|larly a great number of Thracians and other barba|rians, who were appointed for its defence: but no|thing could re&s;i&s;t the ardour of Cae&s;ar's victorious army; they were at la&s;t driven from their trenches, and all fled to the mountains not far off. Cae&s;ar &s;ee|ing the field and camp &s;trewed with his fallen coun|trymen, was &s;trongly affected at &s;o melancholy a pro&s;pect, and could not help crying out to one that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ood near him, "They would have it &s;o." Upon entering the enemies camp, every object pre&s;ented fre&s;h in&s;tances of the blind pre&s;umption and mad|ne&s;s of his adver&s;aries: on all &s;ides were to be &s;een <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ents adorned with ivy and branches of myrtle, couches covered with purple, and &s;ide-boards load|ed with plate. Every thing gave proofs of the highe&s;t luxury, and &s;eemed rather the preparatives for a banquet, the rejoicings for a victory, than the di&s;|po&s;itions for a battle. A camp &s;o richly furni&s;hed,

might have been able to engage the attention of any troops but Cae&s;ar's; there was &s;till &s;omething to be done, and he would not permit them to pur&s;ue any other object than their enemies, till they were entire|ly &s;ubdued. A con&s;iderable body of the&s;e having retired to the adjacent mountains, he prevailed on his &s;oldiers to join him in the pur&s;uit, in order to oblige the&s;e to &s;urrender. He began by inclo&s;ing them with a line drawn at the foot of the mountain; but they quickly abandoned a po&s;t which was not tenable for want of water, and endeavoured to reach the city of Lari&s;&s;a. Cae&s;ar led a part of his army by a &s;horter way, and intercepted their retreat, drawing up in order of battle between them and the city. However, the&s;e unhappy fugitives once more found protection from a mountain, at the foot of which a rivulet ran which &s;upplied them with water. Now night approaching, Cae&s;ar's men were almo&s;t &s;pent, and ready to faint with their ince&s;&s;ant toil &s;ince morn|ing, yet &s;till he prevailed upon them once more to renew their labours, and to cut off the rivulet that &s;upplied the defendants. The &s;ugitives, thus de|prived of all hopes of &s;uccour or &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, &s;ent de|puties to the conqueror, offering to &s;urrender at di&s;|cretion. During this interval of negociation, a few &s;enators that were among them, took the advantage of the night to e&s;cape, and the re&s;t next morning gave up their arms, and experienced the conqueror's clemency. In fact, he addre&s;&s;ed them with great gentlene&s;s, and forbade his &s;oldiers to offer them any violence, or to take any thing from them. Thus Cae&s;ar, by his conduct, gained the mo&s;t complete victory that had ever been obtained; and by his great clemency after the battle, &s;eemed to have de&s;erved it. His lo&s;s amounted to but two hundred men; that of Pompey to fifteen thou&s;and, as well Romans as auxiliaries: twenty-four thou&s;and men &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war, and the greate&s;t part of

the&s;e entered into Cae&s;ar's army, and were incor|porated with the re&s;t of his forces. As to the &s;ena|tors and Roman knights who fell into his hands, he generou&s;ly gave them liberty to retire wherever they thought proper: and as for the letters which Pom|pey had received from &s;everal per&s;ons who wi&s;hed to be thought neutral, he burnt them all without read|ing them, as Pompey had done upon a former oc|ca&s;ion. Thus having performed all the duties of a general and a &s;tate&s;man, he &s;ent for the legions which had paled the night in the camp, to relieve tho&s;e which had accompanied him in the pur&s;uit, and ar|rived the &s;ame day at Lari&s;&s;a.</P>
<P>As for Pompey, who had formerly &s;hewn &s;uch in|&s;tances of courage and conduct, when he &s;aw his ca|valry routed, on which he had placed his &s;ole de|pendence, he ab&s;olutely loft his rea&s;on. In&s;tead of thinking how to remedy this di&s;order by rallying &s;uch troops as &s;led, or by oppo&s;ing fre&s;h troops to &s;top the progre&s;s of the conquerors, being totally amazed by this fir&s;t blow, he returned to the camp, and in his tent waited the i&s;&s;ue of an event, which it was his duty to direct, not to follow: there he re|mained for &s;ome moments without &s;peaking, till be|ing told, that the camp was attacked, "What," &s;ays he, <Q>are we pur&s;ued to our very entrench|ments?</Q> and immediately quitting his armour for a habit more &s;uited to his circum&s;tances, he fled away on hor&s;eback to Lari&s;&s;a; from whence, per|ceiving he was not pur&s;ued, he &s;lackened his pace, g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing way to all the agonizing reflections which his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eplo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> &s;ituation mu&s;t naturally &s;ugge&s;t.

to &s;ail, in which he embarked, the ma&s;ter of the ve&s;&s;el &s;till paying him the homage which was due to this former &s;tation. From the mouth of the river Poneus he &s;ailed to Amphipolis, where finding his affairs de&s;perate, he &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eered to Le&s;bos, to take in his wife Cornelia, whom he had left there, at a di&s;tance from the dangers and hurry of the war. She, who had long flattered her&s;elf with the hopes of victory, felt the rever&s;e of her fortune in an agony of di&s;tre&s;s: &s;he was de&s;ired by the me&s;&s;enger, who&s;e tears, more than words, proclaimed the greatne&s;s of her misfor|tunes, to ha&s;ten, if &s;he expected to &s;ee Pompey, with but one &s;hip, and even that not his own: her grief, which before was violent, became then in&s;upport|able; &s;he fainted away, and lay a con&s;iderable time without any &s;igns of life. At length, recovering her|&s;elf, and reflecting it was now no time for vain la|mentations, &s;he ran quite through the city to the &s;ea-&s;ide. Pompey embraced her, without &s;peaking a word, and for &s;ome time, &s;upported her in his arms in &s;ilent de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Having taken in Cornelia, he now continued his cour&s;e, &s;teering to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, and &s;topping no longer than was nece&s;&s;ary to take in provi&s;ions at the ports that occurred in his pa&s;&s;age. He was at la&s;t prevailed upon to apply to Ptolemy, king of Egypt, to who&s;e father Pompey had been a con&s;iderable be|nefactor. Ptolemy, who was as yet a minor, had not the government in his own hands, but he and his kingdom were under the direction of Photinus, an eunuch, and Theodotus, a ma&s;ter of the art of &s;peaking. The&s;e advi&s;ed, that Pompey &s;hould be invited on &s;hore, and there &s;lain; and, accordingly, Achillas, the commander of the forces, and Septi|mius, by birth a Roman, and who had formerly been a centurion in Pompey's army, were appointed to carry their opinions into execution. Being attend|ed by three or four more, they went into a little
<PB N="151" REF="162">
bark, and rowed off from land towards Pompey's &s;hip, that lay about a mile from the &s;hore. Pompey, after having taken leave of Cornelia, who wept at his departure, and having repeated two ver&s;es of Sopho|cles, &s;ignifying, that he who tru&s;ts his freedom to a tyrant, from that moment becomes a &s;lave, gave his hand to Achillas, and &s;tept into the bark, with only two attendants of his own. They had now rowed from the &s;hip a good way, and as during that time they all kept a profound &s;ilence, Pompey, willing to begin the di&s;cour&s;e, acco&s;ted Septimius, who&s;e face he recollected. "Methinks, friend," cried he "you and I were once fellow-&s;oldiers together." Sep|timius gave only a nod with his head, without utter|ing a word, or in&s;tancing the lea&s;t civility. Pom|pey, therefore, took out a paper, on which he had minuted a &s;peech he intended to make to the king, and began reading it. In this manner they ap|proached the &s;hore; and Cornelia, who&s;e concern had never &s;uffered her to lo&s;e &s;ight of her hu&s;band, be|gan to conceive hope, when &s;he perceived the people on the &s;trand crowding down along the coa&s;ts, as if willing to receive him: but her hopes were &s;oon de|&s;troyed; for that in&s;tant, as Pompey ro&s;e, &s;upport|ing him&s;elf upon his freedman's arm, Septimius &s;tabbed him in the back, and was in&s;tantly &s;econded by Achillas. Pompey perceiving his death inevit|able, only di&s;po&s;ed him&s;elf to meet it with decency, and covering his face with his robe, without &s;peak|ing a word, with a &s;igh re&s;igned him&s;elf to his fate. At this horrid &s;ight Cornelia &s;hrieked &s;o loud as to be heard to the &s;hore; but the danger &s;he her&s;elf was in did not allow the mariners time to look on; they immediately &s;et &s;ail, and the wind proving favour|able, fortunately they e&s;caped the pur&s;uit of the Egyptian gallies. In the mean time, Pompey's murderers having cut off his head, cau&s;ed it to be embalmed, the better to pre&s;erve its features, de&s;ign|ing

it for a pre&s;ent to Cae&s;ar. The body was thrown naked on the &s;trand, and expo&s;ed to the view of all tho&s;e who&s;e curio&s;ity led them that way. However, his faithful freedman, Philip, &s;till kept near it, and when the crowd was di&s;per&s;ed he wa&s;hed it in the &s;ea, and looking round for materials to burn it, he perceived the wrecks of a fi&s;hing-boat, of which he compo&s;ed a pile. While he was thus piou&s;ly em|ployed, he was acco&s;ted by an old Roman &s;oldier who had &s;erved under Pompey in his youth. <Q>Who art thou,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>that art making the&s;e hum|ble preparations for Pompey's funeral?</Q> Philip having an&s;wered, that he was one of his freedmen "Alas," replied the &s;oldier, <Q>permit me to &s;hare in this honour al&s;o: among all the mi&s;eries of my exile, it will be my la&s;t &s;ad comfort, that I have been able to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the funeral of my old com|mander, and touch the body of the brave&s;t gene|ral that ever Rome produced.</Q> After this, they both joined in giving the corp&s;e the la&s;t rites, and collecting his a&s;hes, buried them under a little ri&s;ing earth, &s;craped together with their hands, over which was afterwards placed the following in&s;crip|tion: <HI>He who&s;e merits de&s;erve a temple can now &s;car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> find a tomb.</HI></P>

<P>CAESAR has been much celebrated for his for|tune, and yet his abilities &s;eem equal to his highe&s;t &s;ucce&s;s.

Having now gained a mo&s;t complete victory, his &s;ucce&s;s only &s;eemed to increa&s;e his activity, and in&s;pire him with fre&s;h re&s;olution to face new dangers.

But Cae&s;ar had too much humanity to be plea&s;ed with &s;uch an horrid &s;pectacle: he turned away from it with di&s;gu&s;t; and, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, gave vent to his pity in a flood of tears. He &s;hortly after ordered a magnificent tomb to be built to his memory, on the &s;pot where he was murdered; and a temple near the place to Neme&s;is, who was the godde&s;s that puni&s;hed tho&s;e that were cruel to men in adver&s;ity.</P>
<P>It &s;hould &s;eem that the Egyptians by this time had &s;ame hopes of breaking off all alliance with the Ro|mans, which they con&s;idered, as in fact it was, but a&s;pecious &s;ubjection. They fir&s;t began to take of|fence at Cae&s;ar's carrying the en&s;igns of Roman power before him as he entered the city. Photinus, the eunuch, al&s;o treated him with great di&s;re&s;pect, and even attempted his life. Cae&s;ar, however, con|cealed his re&s;entment till he had a force &s;ufficient to puni&s;h his treachery; and &s;ending privately for the legions which had been formerly enrolled for Pom|pey's &s;ervice, as being the neare&s;t to Egypt, he, in the mean time, pretended to repo&s;e an entire confi|dence
<PB N="154" REF="165">
in the king's mini&s;ter, making great entertain|ments, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting at the conferences of the philo|&s;ophers, who were in great numbers at Alexandria. However, he &s;oon changed his manner when he found him&s;elf in no danger from the mini&s;ter's at|tempts, and declared, that, as being Roman con|&s;ul, it was his duty to &s;ettle the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Egyp|tian crown.</P>
<P>There were at that time two pretenders to the crown of Egypt; Ptolemy, the acknowledged king; and the celebrated Cleopatra, his &s;i&s;ter; to whom, by the cu&s;tom of the country, he al&s;o was married; and who, by his father's will, &s;hared jointly in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Not being contented with a bare parti|cipation of power, Cleopatra aimed at governing alone; but being oppo&s;ed in her views by the Roman &s;enate, who confirmed her brother's title to the crown, &s;he was bani&s;hed into Syria with Ar&s;inoe her younger &s;i&s;ter. Cae&s;ar gave her new hopes of a&s;piring to the kingdom, and &s;ent to both her and her bro|ther to plead their cau&s;e before him. Photinus, the young king's guardian, di&s;dained accepting this propo&s;al, and backed his refu&s;al by &s;ending an army of twenty thou&s;and men to be&s;iege him in Alexan|dria. Cae&s;ar bravely repul&s;ed the enemy for &s;ome time; but finding the city of too great extent to be defended by &s;o &s;mall an army as he then commanded, he retired to the palace, which commanded the har|bour, where he purpo&s;ed to make his &s;tand. Achillas, who commanded the Egyptians, attacked him there with great vigour, and &s;till aimed at making him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the fleet that lay before the palace. Cae&s;ar, however, too well knew the importance of tho&s;e &s;hips in the hands of an enemy; and therefore burnt them all, in &s;pite of every effort to prevent him. He next po&s;&s;e&s;t him&s;elf of the i&s;le of Pharos, which was the key to the Alexandrian port; by which he was enabled to receive the &s;upplies &s;ent him from all &s;ides;
<PB N="155" REF="166">
and, in this &s;ituation, he determined to with&s;tand the united force of all the Egyptians.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Cleopatra, having heard of the pre&s;ent turn in her favour, re&s;olved to depend rather on Cae&s;ar's favour for gaining the government, than her own forces. But no arts, as &s;he ju&s;tly conceiv|ed, were &s;o likely to influence Cae&s;ar as the charms of her per&s;on, which, though not faultle&s;s, were yet extremely &s;educing. She was now in the bloom of youth, and every feature borrowed grace from the lively turn of her temper. To the mo&s;t enchanting addre&s;s &s;he joined the mo&s;t harmonious voice. With all the&s;e accompli&s;hments, &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a great &s;hare of the learning of the times, and could give audience to the amba&s;&s;adors of &s;even different nations without an interpreter. The difficulty was how to get at Cae&s;ar, as her enemies were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the avenues that led to the palace. For this purpo&s;e &s;he went on board a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el, and, in the evening, landed near the palace, where, being wrapt up in a coverlet, &s;he was carried by one A&s;polodorus into the very chamber of Cre&s;ar. Her addre&s;s, at fir&s;t, plea&s;ed him; her wit and under&s;tanding &s;till fanned the flame; but her care&s;&s;es, which were carried beyond the bounds of innocence, intirely brought him over to &s;econd her claims.</P>
<P>While Cleopatra was thus employed in forwarding her own views, her &s;i&s;ter Ar&s;inoe was al&s;o &s;trenu|ou&s;ly engaged in the camp, in pur&s;uing a &s;eparate in|tere&s;t. She had found means, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of one Ganymede, her confident, to make a large divi&s;ion in the Egyptian army in her favour; and &s;oon after, by one of tho&s;e &s;udden revolutions which are com|mon in barbarian camps to this day, &s;he cau&s;ed Achillas to be murdered, and Ganymede to take the command in his &s;tead, and to carry on the &s;iege with greater vigour than before. Ganymede's principal
<PB N="156" REF="167">
effort was by letting in the &s;ea upon tho&s;e canals which &s;upplied the palace with fre&s;h water; but this inconvenience Cae&s;ar remedied by digging a great number of wells. His next endeavour was, to pre|vent the junction of Cae&s;ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s twenty-fourth legion, which he twice attempted in vain. He &s;oon after made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of a bridge which joined the i&s;le of Pharos to the continent, from which po&s;t Cae&s;ar was re&s;olved to di&s;lodge him. In the heat of the action, &s;ome mariners, partly through curio&s;ity, and partly ambition, came and joined the combatants, but, being &s;eized with a panic, in&s;tantly fled, and &s;pread a general terror through the army. All Cae&s;ar's endeavours to rally his forces were in vain, the confu&s;ion was pa&s;t remedy, and numbers were drowned or put to the &s;word in attempting to e&s;cape. Now, therefore, &s;eeing the irremediable di&s;order of his troops, he retired to a &s;hip, in order to get <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the palace that was ju&s;t oppo&s;ite: however, he was no &s;ooner on board than great crowds entered at the &s;ame time with him; upon which, apprehen&s;ive of the &s;hip's &s;inking, he jumped into the &s;ea, and &s;wam two hundred paces to the fleet that lay before, the palace, all the time holding his own Commen|taries in his left hand above water, and his coat of mail in his teeth.</P>
<P>The Alexandrians, finding their efforts to take the palace ineffectual, endeavoured, at lea&s;t, to get their king out of Cae&s;ar's power, as he had &s;eized upon his per&s;on in the beginning of their di&s;putes. For this purpo&s;e they made u&s;e of their cu&s;tomary arts of di&s;&s;i|mulation, profe&s;&s;ing the utmo&s;t de&s;ire of peace, and only wanting the pre&s;ence of their lawful prince to give a &s;anction to the treaty. Cae&s;ar, who was &s;en|&s;ible of their perfidy, neverthele&s;s concealed his &s;u&s;|picions, and gave them their king, as he was under no apprehen&s;ions from the abilities of a boy. Ptolemy,
<PB N="157" REF="168">
however, the in&s;tant he was &s;et at liberty, in&s;tead of promoting the peace, made every effort to give vigour to his ho&s;tilities.</P>
<P>In this manner Cae&s;ar was hemmed in for &s;ome time by this artful and in&s;iduous enemy, with all manner of difficulties again&s;t him; but he was at la&s;t re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eved from this mortifying &s;ituation by Mithri|dates Pergamenus, one of his mo&s;t faithful partizans, who came with an army to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. This ge|neral, collecting a numerous army in Syria, march|ed into Egypt, took the city of Pelu&s;ium, repul&s;ed the Egyptian army with lo&s;s, and at la&s;t, joining with Cae&s;ar, attacked their camp with a great &s;laugh|ter of the Egyptians: Ptolemy him&s;elf, attempting to e&s;cape on board a ve&s;&s;el that was failing down the river, was drowned by the &s;hip's &s;inking, and Cae&s;ar thus became ma&s;ter of all Egypt without any farther oppo&s;ition. He therefore, appointed Cleopatra, with her younger brother, who was then but an infant, as joint governors, according to the intent of their fa|ther's will, and drove out Ar&s;inoe with Ganymede into bani&s;hment.</P>
<P>Having thus given away kingdoms, he now for a while, &s;eemed to relax from the u&s;ual activity of his con&s;ult, captivated with the charms of Cleopatra. In&s;tead of quitting Egypt to go and quell the remains of Pompey's party, he there abandoned him&s;elf to his plea&s;ures, pa&s;&s;ing whole nights in fea&s;ting, and all the excu&s;es of high-wrought luxury, with the young queen. He even re&s;olved to attend her up the Nile into Aethiopia; but the brave veterans who had long followed his fortune, boldly reprehended his conduct, and refu&s;ed to be partners in &s;o infamous an expedi|tion. Thus, at length, rouzed from his lethargy, he re&s;olved to prefer the call of ambition to that of love, and to leave Cleopatra, (by whom he had a &s;on who was afterwards named Cae&s;ario,) in order to op|po&s;e

Pharnces, the king of Bo&s;phorus, who had made &s;ome inroads upon the dominions of Rome.</P>
<P>This prince, who was the &s;on of the great Mithri|dates, being ambitious of recovering his father's do|minions, &s;eized upon Armenia and Colchis, and overcame Domitius, who had been &s;ent again&s;t him. Upon Cae&s;ar's march to oppo&s;e him, Pharnaces, who was as much terrified at the name of the general as at the &s;trength of his army, laboured, by all the arts of negociation, to avert the impending danger Cae&s;ar, exa&s;perated at his crimes and ingratitude, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fir&s;t di&s;&s;embled with the amba&s;&s;adors, and, u&s;ing all expedition, fell upon the enemy unexpectedly, and in a few hours, obtained a &s;peedy and complete victory. Pharnaces attempting to take refuge in his capital, was &s;lain by one of his own commanders&mdash; A ju&s;t puni&s;hment for his former parricide. But Cae&s;ar conquered him with &s;o much ea&s;e, that, in writing to a friend at Rome, he expre&s;t the rapidity of his victory in three words, <HI>"Veni, vidi, vici:"</HI> man &s;o accu&s;tomed to conque&s;t, thought a &s;light bat|tle &s;carce worth a longer letter.</P>
<P>Cae&s;ar having &s;ettled affairs in this part of the em|pire, as well as time would permit, embarked for Italy, where he arrived &s;ooner than his enemies could expect, but not before his affairs there ab&s;olutely re|quired his pre&s;ence. He had been, during his ab|&s;ence, created con&s;ul for five years, dictator for one year, and tribune of the people for life. But An|thony, who in the mean time governed in Rome for him, had filled the city with riot and debaucher<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and many commotions en&s;ued, which nothing but the arrival of Cae&s;ar &s;o opportunely could appea&s;ed However, by his moderation and humanity, he &s;oon re&s;tored tranquility to the city, &s;carce making any di&s;tinction between tho&s;e of his own and the oppo&s;ite party.

<PB N="159" REF="170">
at home, he prepared to march into Africa, where Pompey's party had found time to rally under Scipio and Cato, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Juba, king of Mau|ritania; and with his u&s;ual diligence, landed with a &s;mall party in Africa, while the re&s;t of his army fol|lowed him. Scipio coming to a battle &s;oon af|ter, received a complete and final overthrow, with little or no lo&s;s on the &s;ide of the victor. Juba and Petreius his general killed each other in de&s;pair; Scipio, attempting to e&s;cape by &s;ea into Spain, fell in among the enemy and was &s;lain; &s;o that, of all the generals of that undone party, Cato was now the only one that remained.</P>
<P>This extraordinary man, whom no pro&s;perity could fate, nor no misfortune depre&s;s, having retired into Africa after the battle of Phar&s;alia, had led the wretched remains of that defeat through burning de|&s;erts and tracts infe&s;ted with &s;erpents of various ma|lignity, and was now in the city of Utica, which he had been left to defend. Still, however, in love with even the &s;hew of Roman government, he had formed the principal citizens into a &s;enate, and conceived a re&s;olution of holding out the town. But the enthu|&s;ia&s;m for liberty &s;ub&s;iding among his followers, he was re&s;olved no longer to force men to be free who &s;eemed naturally prone to &s;lavery. He now, there|fore, de&s;ired &s;ome of his friends to &s;ave them&s;elves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ea, and bade others to rely upon Cae&s;ar's cle|mency; ob&s;erving, that, as to him&s;elf, he was at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> victorious. After this, &s;upping chearfully among <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is friends, he retired to his apartment, where he behaved with unu&s;ual tenderne&s;s to his &s;on, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his friends. When he came into his bed-cham|ber, he laid him&s;elf down, and took up Plato's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">logue on the immortality of the &s;oul; and, hav|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng read for &s;ome time, happening to ca&s;t his eyes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the head of his bed, he was much &s;urprized not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> had his &s;word there, which had been taken away
<PB N="160" REF="171">
by his &s;on's order while they were at &s;upper. Upon this, calling one of his dome&s;tics to know what was become of his &s;word, and receiving no an&s;wer, he re&s;umed his &s;tudies; but &s;ome time after called for his &s;word again. When he had done reading, and perceiving nobody obeyed him in bringing his &s;word, he called his dome&s;tics one after the other, and with a peremptory air demanded his &s;word once more. His &s;on came in &s;oon after, and with tears be&s;ought him in the mo&s;t humble manner to change his re&s;olution; but receiving a &s;tern reprimand, he de&s;i&s;ted from his per&s;ua&s;ions. His &s;word being at length brought him, he &s;eemed &s;ati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fied, and cried out, "Now again I am m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ter of my&s;elf." He then took up the book again, which he lead twice over, and fell into a &s;ound &s;leep. Upon awaking, he call|ed to one of his freedmen to know if his friends were embarked, or if any thing yet remained that could be done to &s;erve them. The freedmen a&s;&s;uring him that all was quiet, he was then ordered again to leave the room; and Cato was no &s;ooner alone than he &s;tabbed him&s;elf with his &s;word through the brea&s;t, but not with that force he intended, for the wound not di&s;patching him, he fell upon his bed, and at the &s;ame time overturned a table on which he had been drawing &s;ome geometrical figures. At the noi&s;e he made in his fall, his &s;ervants gave a &s;hrick<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and his &s;on and friends immediately entered the room, They found him we&s;tering in his blood, and his bowels pu&s;hed out through the wound. The phy&s;ician, who attended his family, perceiving than his inte&s;tines were yet untouched, was for replacing them; but when Cato had recovered his &s;en&s;es, and under&s;tood their intention to pre&s;erve his life, he pu&s;h|ed the phy&s;ician from him, and with a fierce re&s;olu|tion tore out his bowels and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">xpired.</P>
<P>Upon the death of Cato, the war in Africa being completed, Cae&s;ar returned in triumph to Rome;
<PB N="161" REF="172">
and, as if he had abridged all his former triumphs only to encrea&s;e the &s;plendor of this, the citizens were a&s;toni&s;hed at the magnificence of the proce&s;|&s;ion, and the number of the countries he had &s;ub|dued. It la&s;ted four days: the fir&s;t was for Gaul, the &s;econd for Egypt, the third for his victories in A&s;ia, and the fourth for that over Juba in Africa. His veteran &s;oldiers, all &s;carred with wounds, and now laid up for life, followed their triumphant ge|neral crowned with laurels, and conducted him to the Capitol. To every one of the&s;e he gave a &s;um equivalent to about an hundred and fifty pounds of our money, double that &s;um to the centurions, and four times as much to the &s;uperior officers. The citizens al&s;o &s;hared his bounty; to every one of which he di&s;tributed ten bu&s;hels of corn, ten pounds of oil, and a &s;um of money equal to about two pounds &s;terling of ours. He, after this, entertained the people at above twenty thou&s;and tables, treated them with the combat of gladiators, and filled Rome with a concour&s;e of &s;pectators from every part of Italy.</P>
<P>The people, intoxicated with the allurements of plea&s;ure, thought their freedom too &s;mall a return for &s;uch benefits: they &s;eemed eager only to find out new modes of homage, and unu&s;ual epithets of adulation for their great en&s;laver. He was created by a new title <HI>Magi&s;ter Morum,</HI> or ma&s;ter of the morals of the people; he received the title of emperor, father of his country; his per&s;on was declared &s;acred; and, in &s;hort, upon him alone were devolved for life all the great dignities of the &s;tate. It mu&s;t be owned, how|ever, that &s;o much power could never have been en|tru&s;ted to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tter keeping. He immediately began his empire by repre&s;&s;ing vice and encouraging virtue. He comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tted the power of judicature to the &s;enators and the knights alone, and by many &s;umptuary laws <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;candalous luxuries of the rich.

propo&s;ed rewards to all &s;uch as had many children, and took the mo&s;t prudent methods of repeopling the city that had been exhau&s;ted in the late com|motions.</P>
<P>Having thus re&s;tored pro&s;perity once more to Rome, he again found him&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of going into Spain to oppo&s;e an army which had been rai&s;ed there under the two &s;ons of Pompey, and al&s;o Labicnus his former general. He proceeded in this expedition with his u&s;ual celerity, and arrived in Spain before the enemy thought him yet departed from Rome. Cneius and Sextus, Pompey's &s;ons, profiting by their unhappy father's example, re&s;olved as much as po&s;&s;ible to protract the war; &s;o that the fir&s;t operations of the two armies were &s;pent in &s;ieges and fruitle&s;s attempts to &s;urpri&s;e each other&punc; At length Cae&s;ar, after taking many cities from the enemy, and pur&s;uing Pompey with unwearied per|&s;everance, at la&s;t compelled him to come to a battle upon the plains of Munda. Pompey drew up his men by break of day upon the declivity of an hill with great exactne&s;s and order. Cae&s;ar drew up his men likewi&s;e in the plain below; and, after advanc|ing a little way from his trenches, he ordered his men to make an halt, expecting the enemy to come down from the hill. This delay made Cae&s;ar's &s;ol|diers begin to murmur, while Pompey's with full vigour poured down upon them, and a dreadful con|flict en&s;ued. The fir&s;t &s;hock was &s;o dreadful, that Cae&s;ar's men, who had hitherto been u&s;ed to conquer now began to waver. Cae&s;ar was never in &s;o much danger as now; he threw him&s;elf &s;everal times into the very throng of battle. "What," cried he, <Q>are you going to give up your general, who is grown grey in fighting at your head, to a parcel of boy?</Q> Upon this, his tenth legion exerted them|&s;elves with more than former bravery; and a party of hor&s;e being detached by Labienus from the camp in
<PB N="163" REF="174">
pur&s;uit of a body of Numidian cavalry, Cae&s;ar cried aloud, that they were flying. This cry in&s;tantly &s;pread it&s;elf through both armies, exciting the one as much as it depre&s;&s;ed the other. Now, therefore, the tenth legion pre&s;&s;ed forward, and a total rout &s;oon en&s;ued. Thirty thou&s;and men were killed on Pompey's &s;ide, among&s;t whom was Labienus, whom Cae&s;ar ordered to be buried with the funeral honours of a general officer. Cneius Pompey e&s;caped with a few hor&s;emen to the &s;ea-&s;ide, but finding his pa&s;&s;age intercepted by Cae&s;ar's lieutenant, he was obliged to &s;eek for a retreat in an ob&s;cure cavern. He was quickly di&s;covered by &s;ome of Cae&s;ar's troops, who pre&s;ently cut off his head and brought it to the con|queror. His brother Sextus, however, concealed him|&s;elf &s;o well that he e&s;caped all pur&s;uit; and afterwards became very noted and formidable from his piracies to the people of Rome.</P>
<P>Cae&s;ar by this la&s;t blow &s;ubdued all his avowed enemies, and the re&s;t of his life was employed for the advantage of the &s;tate. He adorned the city with magnificent buildings; he rebuilt Carthage and Corinth, &s;ending colonies to both cities; he under|took to level &s;everal mountains in Italy, to drain the Pontine mar&s;hes near Rome, and de&s;igned to cut through the i&s;thmus of Peloponne&s;us. Thus, with a mind that could never remain inactive, he pon|dered mighty projects and de&s;igns beyond the limits of the longe&s;t life; but the greate&s;t of all was his in|tended expedition again&s;t the Parthians, by which he de&s;igned to revenge the death of Cra&s;&s;us, who, hav|ing penetrated too far into their country, was over|thrown, him&s;elf taken pri&s;oner, and put to a cruel death, by having molten gold poured down his throat, as a puni&s;hment for his former avarice. From thence Cae&s;ar intended to pa&s;s through Hyrca|nia, and enter Scythia along the banks of the Ca&s;|pian &s;ea; then to open him&s;elf a way through the
<PB N="164" REF="175">
immea&s;urable fore&s;ts of Germany into Gaul, and &s;o to return to Rome. The&s;e were the aims of ambi|tion: the jealou&s;y of a few individuals put an end to them all.</P>
<P>Having been made perpetual dictator, and receiv|ed from the &s;enate accumulated honours, it began to be rumoured that he intended to make him&s;elf king, and, though in fact he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the power, the people, who had an utter aver&s;ion to the name<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> could not bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his a&s;&s;uming the title. Whether he really de&s;igned to a&s;&s;ume that empty honour mu&s;t now for ever remain a &s;ecret; but certain it is, that the un&s;u&s;pecting openne&s;s of his conduct marked &s;omething like a confidence in the innocence of his intentions. When informed by tho&s;e about him of the jealou&s;ies of many per&s;ons who envied his power, he was heard to &s;ay, that he had rather die once by trea&s;on, than to live continually in apprehen&s;ion of it. When advi&s;ed by &s;ome to beware of Brutus, in whom he had for &s;ome time repo&s;ed the greate&s;t con|fidence, he opened his brea&s;t, all &s;carred with wounds, &s;aying, <Q>Can you think Brutus cares for &s;uch poor pillage as this?</Q> and being one night at &s;upper, as his friends di&s;puted among them&s;elves what death was ea&s;ie&s;t, he replied, that which was mo&s;t &s;udden, and lea&s;t fore&s;een. But to convince the world how little he had to apprehend from his enemies, he di&s;banded his company of Spani&s;h guards, which facilitated the enterprize again&s;t his life.</P>
<P>A deep con&s;piracy was, therefore, laid again&s;t him, compo&s;ed of no le&s;s than &s;ixty &s;enators.

&s;oon after; both praetors for the pre&s;ent year. Bru|tus made it his chief glory to have been de&s;cended from that Brutus who fir&s;t gave liberty to Rome. The pa&s;&s;ion for freedom &s;eemed to have been tran&s;|mitted with the blood of his ance&s;tors down to him. But though he dete&s;ted tyranny, yet he could not forbear loving the tyrant, from whom he had re|ceived the mo&s;t &s;ignal benefits.</P>
<P>The con&s;pirators, to give a colour of ju&s;tice to their proceedings, remitted the execution of their de&s;ign to the ides of March, the day on which Cae|&s;ar was to be offered the crown. The augurs had foretold that this day would be fatal to him, and the night preceding he heard his wi&s;e Calpurnia lament|ing in her &s;leep, and being awakened &s;he confe&s;&s;ed to him, that &s;he dreamt of his being a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated in her arms. The&s;e omens, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, began to change his intentions of going to the &s;enate, as he had re&s;olved, that day; but one of the con&s;pirators coming in, prevailed upon him to keep his re&s;olution, telling him of the reproach that would attend his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">taying at home till his wife had lucky dreams, and of the preparations that were made for his appear|ance. As he went along to the &s;enate, a &s;lave, who ha&s;tened to him with information of the con&s;piracy, attempted to come near him, but could not for the crowd. Arternidorus, a Greek philo&s;opher, who had di&s;covered the whole plot, delivered him a me|morial containing the heads of his information; but Cae&s;ar gave it, with other papers, to one of his &s;ecre|taries without reading, as was u&s;ual in things of this nature. Being at length entered the &s;enate-hou&s;e, where the con&s;pirators were prepared to receive him, he met one Spurina, an augur, who had foretold his danger, to whom he &s;aid, &s;miling, <Q>Well, Spuri|na, the ides of March are come.</Q> "Yes," re|plied the augur, "but they are not yet over." As &s;oon as he had taken his place, the con&s;pirators came
<PB N="166" REF="177">
near him under pretence of &s;aluting him; and Cim+ber, who was one of them, approached in a &s;up+pliant po&s;ture, pretending to &s;ue for his brother pardon, who had been bani&s;hed by his order. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the con&s;pirators &s;econded him with great earne&s;tne&s;s and Cimber, &s;eeming to &s;ue with &s;till greater &s;ub+mi&s;&s;ion, took hold of the bottom of his robe, holding him &s;o as to prevent his ri&s;ing. This was the &s;igna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> agreed on. Ca&s;ca, who was behind, &s;tabbed him though &s;lightly, in the &s;houlder. Cae&s;ar in&s;tantly turn+ed round, and, with the &s;teel of his tablet, wounde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> him in the arm. However, all the con&s;pirators were now alarmed, and, inclo&s;ing him round, he re|ceived a &s;econd &s;tab from an unknown hand in the brea&s;t, while Ca&s;&s;ius wounded him in the face. He &s;till defended him&s;elf with great vigour, ru&s;hing among them, and throwing down &s;uch as oppo&s;ed him, till he &s;aw Brutus among the con&s;pirators, who, coming up, &s;truck his dagger into his thigh. From that moment Cae&s;ar thought no more of de|fending him&s;elf, but looking upon this con&s;pirator, cried out, "And you too, my &s;on!" Then covering his head, and &s;preading his robe before him, in or|der to fall with greater decency, he &s;unk down at the ba&s;e of Pompey's &s;tatue, after receiving three and twenty wounds from hands which he vainly &s;uppo&s;ed he had di&s;armed by his benefits.</P>

which the chances of &s;ucceeding were &s;o many again&s;t him: it is mo&s;t probable that, like all very &s;ucce&s;ful men, he only made the be&s;t of every oc|currence; and his ambition ri&s;ing with his good for|tune, from at fir&s;t being contented with humbler aims, he at la&s;t began to think of governing the world, when he found &s;carce any ob&s;tacle to oppo&s;e his de&s;igns. Such is the di&s;po&s;ition of man, who&s;e cravings after power are always mo&s;t in&s;atiable when he enjoys the greate&s;t &s;hare.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the con&s;pirators had di&s;patched Cae&s;ar, they all retired to the Capitol, and guarded its ac|c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;es by a body of gladiators which Brutus had in pay.</P>
<P>The friends of the late dictator now began to find that this was the time for coming into greater power than before, and for &s;atisfying their ambition under the veil of promoting ju&s;tice. Of this num|ber was Antony, whom we have already &s;een acting as a lieutenant under Cae&s;ar, and governing Rome in his ab&s;ence. He was a man of moderate abilities and exce&s;&s;ive vices, ambitious of power only becau&s;e it gave his plea&s;ures a wider range to riot in; but &s;killed in war, to which he had been trained from his youth. He was con&s;ul for this year, and re&s;olved, with Lepidus, who was fond of commotions like him&s;elf, to &s;eize this opportunity of gaining that power which Cae&s;ar had died for u&s;urping. Lepidus, therefore, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Forum with a band of &s;oldiers at his devotion; and Antony, being con&s;ul, was per|mitted to command them. Their fir&s;t &s;tep was to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of all Cae&s;ar's papers and money, and the next to convene the &s;enate. Never had this augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly been convened upon &s;o delicate an occa&s;ion, as it was to determine, whether Cae&s;ar had been a legal magi&s;trate or a tyrannical u&s;uper; and whether tho&s;e who killed him merited rewards or puni&s;hments. There were many of the&s;e who had
<PB N="168" REF="179">
received all their promotions from Cae&s;ar, and had acquired large fortunes in con&s;equence of his appoint|ments: to vote him an u&s;urper, therefore, would be to endanger their property; and yet, to vote him innocent, might endanger the &s;tate. In this dilem|ma they &s;eemed willing to reconcile extremes; wherefore they approved all the acts of Cae&s;ar, and yet granted a general pardon to all the con|&s;pirators.</P>
<P>This decree was very far from giving Anthony &s;ati&s;faction, as it granted &s;ecurity to a number of men who were the avowed enemies of tyranny, and who would be foremo&s;t in oppo&s;ing his &s;chemes of re&s;toring ab&s;olute power. As, therefore, the &s;enate had ratified all Cae&s;ar's acts without di&s;tinction, he formed a &s;cheme upon this of making him rule when dead as imperiou&s;ly as he bad done when living. Being, as was &s;aid, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Cae&s;ar's books of ac|counts, he &s;o far gained upon his &s;ecretary as to make him in&s;ert whatever he thought proper. By the&s;e means great &s;ums of money, which Cae&s;ar would never have be&s;towed, were there di&s;tributed among the people; and every man who had any &s;e|ditious de&s;igns again&s;t the government was there &s;ure of finding a gratuity. Things being in this &s;itua|tion, Antony demanded of the &s;enate, that Cae&s;ar's funeral ob&s;equies &s;hould be performed, which they could not decently forbid, as they had never declar|ed him a tyrant: accordingly, the body was brought forth into the Forum with the utmo&s;t &s;olemnity; and Antony, who charged him&s;elf with the&s;e la&s;t duties of friend&s;hip, began his operations upon the pa&s;&s;ions of the people by the prevailing motives of private in|tere&s;t. He fir&s;t read them Cae&s;ar's will, in which he had left Octavius, his &s;i&s;ter's grand&s;on, his heir, per|mitting him to take the name of Cae&s;ar, and three parts of his private fortune; and Brutus was to in|herit in ca&s;e of his death. The Roman people were

left the gardens which he had on the other &s;ide of the Tyber; and every citizen, in particular, was to receive three hundred &s;e&s;terces; and unfolding Cae&s;ar's bloody, robe in &s;ight of the multitude, he took care they &s;hould ob&s;erve the number of &s;tabs in it: then di&s;played an image which to them appeared the body of Cae&s;ar all covered with wounds. They could no longer contain their indignation, but unani|mou&s;ly cried out for revenge, and ran, with flaming brands from the pile, to &s;et fire to the con&s;pirators hou&s;es. In this rage of re&s;entment, meeting with one Cinna, whom they mi&s;took for another of the &s;ame name who was in the con&s;piracy, they tore him in pieces. The con&s;pirators them&s;elves, how|ever, being well guarded, repul&s;ed the multitude with no great trouble; but perceiving the rage of the people, they thought it, &s;oon after, &s;afe&s;t to re|tire from the city.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Anthony, who had excited this f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ame, re&s;olved to make the be&s;t of the occa&s;ion.

<P>The meeting of the&s;e three u&s;urpers of their coun|try's freedom, was near Mutina, upon a little i&s;land of the river Panarus.

di&s;&s;idence. Lepidus fir&s;t entered; and, finding all things &s;afe, made the &s;ignal for the other two to ap|proach. They embraced each other upon their fir&s;t meeting; and Augu&s;tus began the conference, by thanking Antony for his zeal, in putting Decimus Brutus to death; who, being abandoned by his army, was taken, as he was de&s;igning to e&s;cape into Mace|donia, and beheaded by Antony's command. They then entered upon the bu&s;ine&s;s that lay before them, without any retro&s;pection of the pa&s;t. Their con|ference la&s;ted for three days; and, in this period, they fixed a divi&s;ion of government, and determined upon the fate of thou&s;ands. The re&s;ult of which was, that the &s;upreme authority &s;hould be lodged in their hands, under the title of the Triumvirate, for the &s;pace of five years; that Antony &s;hould have Gaul; Lepidus, Spain; and Augu&s;tus, Africa, and the Mediterranean i&s;lands. As for Italy, and the ea&s;tern provinces, they were to remain in common, until their general enemy was entirely &s;ubdued; where, among other articles of union, it was agreed, that all their enemies &s;hould be de&s;troyed, of which each pre&s;ented a li&s;t. In the&s;e were compri&s;ed, not only the enemies, but the friends of the Triumvi|rate, &s;ince the partizans of the one were often found among the oppo&s;ers of the other. Thus Lepidus gave up his brother Paulus to the vengeance of his col|league; Antony permitted the pro&s;cription of his uncle Lucius; and Augu&s;tus delivered up the great Cicero, who was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated &s;hortly after by An|tony's command.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Brutus and Ca&s;&s;ius, the prin|cipal of the con&s;pirators again&s;t Cae&s;ar, being com|pelled to quit Rome, went into Greece, where they per&s;uaded the Roman &s;tudents at Athens to declare in the cau&s;e of freedom; then parting, the forme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> rai&s;ed a powerful army in Macedonia, and the adja+cent countries, while the latter went into Syria

In &s;hort, having quitted Italy like di&s;tre&s;&s;ed exiles, without having one &s;ingle &s;ol|dier or one town that owned their command, they now found them&s;elves at the head of a flouri&s;hing army, furni&s;hed with all the nece&s;&s;aries for carrying to the war, and in a condition to &s;upport a conte&s;t where the empire of the world depended on the event.

Upon retiring home it was that Brutus, as Plutarch tells the &s;tory, &s;aw a &s;pectre in his tent. He naturally &s;lept but little, and he had increa&s;ed this &s;tate of watchfulne&s;s by habit and great &s;obriety. He never allowed him&s;elf to &s;leep in the day time, as was then common in Rome; and only gave &s;o much of the night to &s;leep as could bare|ly renew the natural functions. But e&s;pecially now, when oppre&s;t with &s;uch various cares, he only gave a &s;hort time after his nightly repa&s;t to re&s;t; and, waking about midnight, generally read or &s;tudied &s;till morning. It was in the dead of the night, when the whole camp was perfectly quiet, that Brutus was thus employed in reading by a lamp that was ju&s;t ex|piring.

He &s;eemed &s;carce able to re&s;train the exce&s;s of his grief for a man whom he called the la&s;t of the Romans.</P>
<P>But his fir&s;t care, when he became the &s;ole general, was to a&s;&s;emble the di&s;per&s;t troops of Ca&s;&s;ius, and animate them with fre&s;h hopes of victory. As they had lo&s;t all they po&s;&s;e&s;t by the plundering of their camp, he promi&s;ed them two thou&s;and denarii each man to make up their lo&s;&s;es.

making a very great &s;laughter. But the troops which had belonged to Ca&s;&s;ius communicating their terror to the re&s;t of the forces, at la&s;t, the whole army gave way. Brutus, &s;urrounded by the mo&s;t valiant of his officers, fought for a long time with amazing valour. The &s;on of Cato fell fighting by his &s;ide, as al&s;o the brother of Ca&s;&s;ius; &s;o that, at la&s;t, he was obliged to yield to nece&s;&s;ity, and fled. In the mean time the two triumviri, now a&s;&s;ured of victory, ex|pre&s;ly ordered by no means to &s;uffer the general to e&s;cape, for fear he &s;hould renew the war. Thus the whole body of the enemy &s;eemed chiefly intent on Brutus alone, and his capture &s;eemed inevitable. In this deplorable exigence, Lucilius, his friend, was re&s;olved, by his own death, to effect his general's delivery. Upon perceiving a body of Thracian hor&s;e clo&s;ely pur&s;uing Brutus, and ju&s;t upon the point of taking him, he boldly threw him&s;elf in their way, telling them that he was Brutus. The Thracians, overjoyed with &s;o great a prize, immediately di&s;|patched &s;ome of their companions with the news of their &s;ucce&s;s, to the army. Upon which, the ar|dour of the pur&s;uit now abating, Antony marched out to meet his pri&s;oner, and to ha&s;ten his death, or in&s;ult his misfortunes. He was followed by a great number of officers and &s;oldiers, &s;ome &s;ilently deplor|ing the fate of &s;o virtuous a man; others reproaching that mean de&s;ire of life for which he con&s;ented to un|dergo captivity. Antony now &s;eeing the Thracians approach, began to prepare him&s;elf for the inter|view; but the faithful Lucilius, advancing with a chearful air, "It is not Brutus," &s;aid he, <Q>that is taken; fortune has not yet had the power of com|mitting &s;o great an outrage upon virtue. As for my life it is well &s;pent in pre&s;erving his honour; take it, for I have deceived you.</Q> Antony, &s;truck with &s;o much fidelity, pardoned him upon the &s;pot; and from that time forward loaded him with bene|fits, and honoured him with his friend&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="190">In the mean time, Brutus, with a &s;mall number of friends, pa&s;&s;ed over a rivulet, and, night coming on, &s;et down under a rock which concealed him from the pur&s;uit of the enemy. After taking breath for a little time, and ca&s;ting his eyes up to Heaven, he repeated a line from Euripides, containing a wi&s;h to the Gods, <Q>that guilt &s;hould not pa&s;s in this life without puni&s;hment.</Q> To this he added another from the &s;ame poet: <Q>O Virtue! thou empty name, I have wor&s;hipped thee as a real good, but thou art only the &s;lave of Fortune.</Q> He then called to mind, with great tenderne&s;s, tho&s;e whom he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">een peri&s;h in battle, and &s;ent out one Statilius to give him &s;ome information of tho&s;e that remained; but he never returned, being killed by a party of the enemy's hor&s;e. Brutus, judging very rightly of his &s;ite, now re&s;olved to die likewi&s;e, and &s;poke to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">o&s;e who &s;tood round him to lend him their la&s;t &s;ad <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.

<P>From the moment of Brutus's death, the triumviri began to act as &s;overeigns, and to divide the Roman dominions between them, as theirs by right of con|que&s;t. However, though there were apparently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ree who participated all power, yet, in fact, only two were actually po&s;&s;e&s;t of it, &s;ince Lopidus was at fir&s;t admitted merely to curb the mutual jealou&s;y of Antony and Augu&s;tus; and was po&s;&s;e&s;t neither of intere&s;t in the army, nor authority among the people. Their fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t care was to puni&s;h tho&s;e whom they had formerly marked for vengeance. Horten&s;ius, Dru|&s;us,
<PB N="180" REF="191">
and Quintilius Varus, all men of the fir&s;t rank in the commonwealth, either killed them&s;elves or were &s;lain. A &s;enator and his &s;on were ordered to ca&s;t lots for their lives, but both refu&s;ed it; the father voluntarily gave him&s;elf up to the executioner, and the &s;on &s;tabbed him&s;elf before his face. Another begged to have the rites of burial after his death; to which Augu&s;tus replied, <Q>that he &s;hould find a grave in the vultures that devoured him.</Q> But chiefly the people lamented to &s;ee the head of Brutus &s;ent to Rome to be thrown at the foot of Cae&s;ar's &s;tatue. His a&s;hes, however, were &s;ent to his wife Porcia, Cato's daughter, who following the exam|ple of her hu&s;band and father, killed her&s;elf by &s;wallowing burning coals. It is ob&s;erved, that of all tho&s;e who had a hand in the death of Cae&s;ar, not one died a natural death.</P>
<P>The power of the triumviri being thus e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the ruin of the commonwealth, they now be|gan to think of enjoying that homage to which they had a&s;pired. Antony went into Greece to receive the flattery of that refined people, and &s;pent &s;ome time at Athens, conver&s;ing among the philo&s;ophers, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting at their di&s;putes in per&s;on. From thence he pa&s;t over into A&s;ia, where all the monarchs of the Ea&s;t who acknowledged the Roman power, came to pay him their obedience; while the faire&s;t prince&s;&s;es &s;trove to gain his favour by the greatne&s;s of their pre&s;ents, or the allurements of their beauty. In this manner he proceeded from kingdom to kingdom, at|tended by a crowd of &s;overeigns, exacting contribu|tions, di&s;tributing favours, and giving away crowns with ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ricious in&s;olence. He pre&s;ented the king|dom of Canpadocia to Sy&s;enes, in prejudice of Aria|rathes, only becau&s;e he found plea&s;ure in the beauty of G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aphyra, the mother of the former. He &s;ettled Herod in the kingdom of Judea, and &s;upported him again&s;t every oppo&s;er. But among all the &s;ove|reigns
<PB N="181" REF="192">
of the Ea&s;t who &s;hared his favours, none had &s;o large a part as Cleopatra, the celebrated queen of Egypt.</P>
<P>It happened that Serapion, her governor in the i&s;land of Cyprus, had formerly furni&s;hed &s;ome &s;uc|cours to the con&s;pirators; and it was thought proper that he &s;hould an&s;wer for his conduct on that occa|&s;ion. Accordingly, having received orders from Antony to come and clear her&s;elf of this imputation of infidelity, &s;he readily complied, equally con&s;ci|ous of the goodne&s;s of her cau&s;e, and the power of her beauty. She was now in her twenty-&s;eventh year, and con&s;equently had improved tho&s;e allurements by art, which, in earlier age, are &s;eldom attended to Her addre&s;s and wit were &s;till further heighten|ed, and, though there were &s;ome women in Rome that were her equals in beauty, none could rival her in the charms of &s;educing conver&s;ation. Antony was now in Tar&s;us, a city of Cilicia, when Cleo|patra re&s;olved to attend his court in per&s;on. She sailed to meet him down the river Cydnus, at the mouth of which the city &s;tood, with the mo&s;t &s;ump|tuous pageantry. Her galley was covered with gold, the &s;ails of purple, large, and floating in the wind. The oars, of &s;ilver, kept time to the &s;ound of flutes and cymbals. She her&s;elf lay reclined on a couch &s;pangled with &s;tars of gold, and with &s;uch orna|ments as poets and painters had u&s;ually a&s;cribed to Venus. On each &s;ide were boys like Cupids, who famed her by turns; while the mo&s;t beautiful nymphs dre&s;t like Noriads and Graces, were placed at pro|per di&s;tances around her. Upon the banks of the river were kept burning the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite perfumes, while an infinite number of people gazed upon the &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ht with a mixture of delight and admiration. Antony was captivated with her beauty, and, leaving all his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;ine&s;s to &s;atisfy his pa&s;&s;ion, &s;hortly after followed her into Egypt. There he continued in
<PB N="182" REF="193">
all that ea&s;e and &s;oftne&s;s to which his vicious heart was prone, and which that luxurious people were able to &s;upply.</P>
<P>While he remained thus idle in Egypt, Augu&s;tus, who took upon him to lead back the veteran troops and &s;ettle them in Italy, was a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly employed in providing for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. He had promi&s;ed them lands at home, as a recompence for their pa&s;t &s;ervices; but they could not receive their new grants without turning out the former inhabitants. In con|&s;equence of this, multitudes or women, with chil|dren in their arms, who&s;e tender years and inno|cence excited univer&s;al compa&s;&s;ion, daily filled the temples and the &s;treets with their di&s;tre&s;&s;es Num|bers of hu&s;bandmen and &s;hepherds came to depre|cate the conqueror's intention, or to obtain an habi|tation in &s;ome other part of the world. Among this number was Virgil, the poet, to whom mankind owe more obligations, than to a thou&s;and conquerors, who, in an humble manner, begged permi&s;&s;ion to re|tain his patrimonial farm: Virgil obtained his reque&s;t, but the re&s;t of his countrymen, of Mantua and Cre|mona were turned out without mercy.</P>
<P>Italy and Rome now felt the mo&s;t extreme mi&s;e|ries; the in&s;olent &s;oldiers plundered at will; while Sextus Pompey, being ma&s;ter of the &s;ea, cut off all foreign communication, and prevented the people's receiving their u&s;ual &s;upplies of corn. To the&s;e mi&s;|chiefs were added the commencement of another civil war. Pulvia, the wife of Antony, who had been left behind him at Rome, had felt for &s;ome time a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l the rage of jealou&s;y, and re&s;olved to try eve|ry method of bringing back her hu&s;band from the arms of Cleopatra. She con&s;idered a breach with Augu&s;tus, as the only probable means of rouzing him from his lethargy; and, accordingly, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Lucius, her brother in-law, who was then con&s;ul, and entirely devoted to her intere&s;t, &s;he
<PB N="183" REF="194">
began to &s;ow the &s;eeds of di&s;&s;en&s;ion. The pretext was, that Antony &s;hould have a &s;hare in the di&s;tribu|tion of lands as well as Augu&s;tus. This produced negociations between them, and Augu&s;tus offered to make the veterans them&s;elves umpires in the di&s;pute. Lucius refu&s;ed to acquie&s;ce; and, being at the head of more than &s;ix legions, mo&s;tly compo&s;ed of &s;uch as were di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;t, he re&s;olved to compel Augu&s;tus to accept of whatever terms he &s;hould offer. Thus a new war was excited between Augu&s;tus and Antony; on, at lea&s;t, the generals of the latter a&s;&s;umed the &s;anction of his name. Augu&s;tus, however, was victorious: Lucius was hemmed in between two armies, and con&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ained to retreat to Peru&s;ia, a city of Etruria, where he was clo&s;ely be&s;ieged by the op|po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ite party. He made many de&s;perate &s;allies, and Fulvia did all in her power to relieve him, but with|out &s;ucce&s;s. He was at la&s;t, therefore, reduced to &s;uch extremity, by famine, that he came out in per|&s;on, and delivered him&s;elf up to the mercy of the conqueror. Augu&s;tus received him very honour|aly, and generou&s;ly pardoned him and all his fol|lowers.</P>
<P>Antony having heard of his brother's overthrow, and his wife's being compelled to leave Italy, was re&s;olved to oppo&s;e Augu&s;tus without delay. He ac|cordingly &s;ailed, at the head of a con&s;iderable fleet, from Alexandria to Tyre; and from thence to Cy|pius and Rhodes, and had an interview with Fulvia, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> were, at Athens He much blamed her for oc|ca&s;ioning the late di&s;orders; te&s;tified the utmo&s;t con|tempt for her per&s;on; and leaving her upon her ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">r-bed, at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ycion, ha&s;tened into Italy to &s;ight Augu&s;tus. They both met at Brandu&s;ium; and it was now thought that the flames of a civil-war were going to blaze out once more. The forces of An|tony were numerous, but mo&s;tly new rai&s;ed; how|ever, he was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Sextus Pompeius, who, in

the&s;e oppo&s;itions of intere&s;t, was daily coming into power. Augu&s;tus was at the head of tho&s;e veterans; who had always been irre&s;i&s;tible, but who &s;eemed no way di&s;po&s;ed to fight again&s;t Antony, their for|mer general. A negociation was, therefore, propo&s;|ed; and, by the activity of Cocceius a friend to both, a reconciliation was effected. All offences and affronts were mutually forgiven; and, to cement the union, a marriage was concluded between An|tony and Octavia, the &s;i&s;ter of Augu&s;tus. A new divi&s;ion of the Roman empire was made between them; Augu&s;tus was to have the command of the We&s;t; Antony of the Ea&s;t; while Lepidus was obliged to content him&s;elf with the provinces in Africa. As for Sextus Pompeius, he was permitted to retain all the i&s;lands he had already po&s;&s;e&s;t, to|gether with Peloponne&s;us: he was al&s;o granted the privilege of demanding the con&s;ul&s;hip in his ab&s;ence, and of di&s;charging that office by any of his friends. It was likewi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;tipulated to leave the &s;ea open, and pay the people what corn was due out of Sicily. Thus a gene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al peace was concluded, to the great &s;atisfaction of the people, who now expected a ce&s;&s;a|tion from all their calamities.</P>
<P>This calm &s;eemed to continue for &s;ometime; An|tony led his forces again&s;t the Parthians, over whom his lientenant Ventidius had gained &s;ome advan|tages Augu&s;tus drew the greate&s;t part of his army into Gaul, where there were &s;ome di&s;turbances; and Pompey went to &s;ecure his newly ceded province to his intere&s;t. It was on this quarter that fre&s;h mo|tives were given for renewing the war. Antony, who was obliged, by treaty, to quit Peloponne&s;us, refu&s;ed to evacuate it till Pompey had &s;atisfied him for &s;uch debts as were due to him from the inhabi|tants. This Pompey would by no means comply with, but immediately fitted out a new fleet, and re|newed his former enterprizes, by cutting off &s;uch
<PB N="185" REF="196">
corn and provi&s;ions as were con&s;igned to Italy. Thus the grievances of the poor were again re|newed; and the people began to complains, that in&s;tead of three tyrants, they were now oppre&s;&s;ed by four.</P>
<P>In this exigence Augu&s;tus, who had long medi|tated the be&s;t means of dimini&s;hing the number, re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ived to begin by getting rid of Pompey, who kept <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;tate in continual alarms. He was ma&s;ter of two fleets, one, which he had cau&s;ed to be built at Ra|venna: and another which Menodorus, who revolt|ed from Pompey, brought to his aid. His fir&s;t at|tempt was to invade Sicily; but being overpowered in his pa&s;&s;age by Pompey, and afterwards &s;hattered in a &s;torm, he was obliged to defer his de&s;igns to the en&s;uing year. During this interval he was rein|forced by a noble fleet of one hundred and twenty &s;hips, given him by Antony, with which he re&s;olv|ed once more to invade Sicily on three &s;everal quar|ters But fortune &s;eemed &s;till determined to oppo&s;e him. He was a &s;econd time di&s;abled and &s;hattered by a &s;torm; which &s;o rai&s;ed the vanity of Pompey, that he began to &s;tyle him&s;elf the &s;on of Neptune. However, Augu&s;tus was not to be intimidated by any di&s;graces; for, having &s;hortly re&s;itted his navy, and recruited his forces, he gave the command of both to Agrippa, his faithful friend and a&s;&s;ociate in war. Agrippa proved him&s;elf worthy of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him; he began his operations by a victory over Pompey; and, though he was &s;hortly after wor&s;ted him&s;elf, he &s;oon after gave his adver&s;ary a complete and final overthrow Thus undone, Pom|pey re&s;olved to fly to Antony, from whom he expect|ed refuge, as he had formerly obliged that triumvir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by giving protection to his mother.

<P>Antony was now at the city of Leucoplis, revel|ling with his in&s;iduous paramour, when he heard
<PB N="188" REF="199">
that Octavia was at Athens, upon her journey to vi|&s;it him. This was very unwelcome news as well to him as to Cleopatra; who, &s;caring the charms of her rival, endeavoured to convince Antony of the &s;trength of her pa&s;&s;ion by her &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ghs, langui&s;hing looks, and well-feigned melancholy. He frequently caught her in tears, which &s;he &s;eemed as if willing to hide; and often entreated her to tell him the cau&s;e, which &s;he &s;eemed willing to &s;uppre&s;s. The&s;e artifices, together with the cea&s;ele&s;s flattery, and importunity of her creatures, prevailed &s;o much upon Antony's weak|ne&s;s, that he commanded Octavia to return home, without &s;eeing her; and &s;till more to exa&s;perate the people of Rome, he re&s;olved to repudiate her, and take Cleopatra as his wife. He accordingly a&s;&s;em|bled the people of Alexandria in the public theatre, where was rai&s;ed an alcove of &s;ilver, under which were placed two thrones of gold, one for him&s;elf and the other for Cleopatra. There he &s;eated him&s;elf dre&s;t like Bacchus, while Cleopatra &s;at be&s;ide him cloathed in the ornaments and attributes of I&s;is, the principal deity of the Egyptians. On that occa&s;ion he declared her queen of all the countries which he had already be&s;towed upon her; while he a&s;&s;ociated Cae&s;ario, her &s;on by Cae&s;ar, as her partner in the go|vernment To the two children which he had by her him&s;elf, he gave the title of king of kings, with very exten&s;ive domanions: and, to crown his ab&s;ur|dities, he next &s;ent a minute account of his proceed|ings to the two con&s;uls at Rome.</P>
<P>In the mean time Augu&s;tus had now a &s;ufficient pretext for declaring war, and informed the &s;enate of his intentions.

The following year was chiefly taken up in preparations again&s;t Antony, who, perceiving his de&s;ign, remon|&s;trated to the &s;enate, that he had many cau&s;es of
<PB N="189" REF="200">

To this complaint Augu&s;tus was contented to make a &s;ar|ca&s;tic an&s;wer, implying, that it was ab&s;urd to com|plain of his di&s;tribution of a few tri&s;ting di&s;tricts in Italy, when, Antony having conquered Parthia, he might now reward his &s;oldiers with cities and pro|vinces. This &s;arca&s;m provoked him to &s;end his army, without intermi&s;&s;ion, into Europe, to meet Augu&s;tus, while he and Cleopatra followed to Samos, in order to prepare for carrying on the war with vigour. When arrived there it was ridiculous enough to be|hold the odd mixture of preparations for plea&s;ure and for war. On one &s;ide, all the kings and princes from Egyp, to the Euxine &s;ea, had orders to &s;end him &s;upplies both of men, provi&s;ions, and arms; on the other &s;ide, all the comedians, dancers, buffoons, and mu&s;icians ot Greece, were ordered to attend him.</P>
<P>This delay at Samos, and afterwards at Athens, where he carried Cleopatra, to receive new honours, was extremely favourable to the arms of Augu&s;tus, who was, at fir&s;t, &s;carcely in a di&s;po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ition to oppo&s;e him, had he gone into Italy; but he &s;oon found <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to put him&s;elf in a condition for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rying on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; and, &s;hortly after, declared it again&s;t him in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. At length both &s;ides found them&s;elves in re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ine&s;s to begin the war, and their armies were an&s;werable to the empire they contended for. The on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was followed by all the forces of the Ea&s;t; the other drew a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l the &s;trength of the We&s;t to &s;upport his preten&s;ions. Antony's force compo&s;ed a body of an hundred thou&s;and foot, and twelve thou&s;and hor&s;e; while his fleet amounted to five hundred
<PB N="190" REF="201">
&s;hips of war. The army of Augu&s;tus mu&s;tered but eighty thou&s;and foot, but equalled his adver&s;ary's in the number of cavalry: his fleet was but half as nu|merous as Antony's; however, his &s;hips were better built, and manned with better &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>The great deci&s;ive engagement, which was a na|val one, was fought near Actium, a city of Epirus, at the entrance of the gulph of Ambracia. Antony ranged his &s;hips before the mouth of the gulph; and Augu&s;tus drew up his fleet in oppo&s;ition. Neither general a&s;&s;umed any &s;ixt &s;tation to command in, but went about from &s;hip to &s;hip, wherever his pre&s;ence was nece&s;&s;ary. In the mean time, the two land ar|mies, on oppo&s;ite &s;ides of the gulph, were drawn up, only as &s;pectators of the engagement; and en|couraged the fleets, by their &s;houts, to engage. The battle began, on both &s;ides, with great ardour; and after a manner not practi&s;ed upon former occa&s;ions. The prows of their ve&s;&s;els were armed with brazen points; and with the&s;e they drove furiou&s;ly again&s;t each other. They fought for &s;ome time with great fury, nor was there any advantage on either &s;ide, except a &s;mall appearance of di&s;order in the centre of Antony's fleet. But all of a &s;udden, Cleopatra de|termined the fortune of the day. She was &s;een &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y|ing from the engagement, attended by &s;ixty &s;ail; &s;truck, perhaps, with the terrors natural to her &s;ex: but what encrea&s;ed the general amazement, was, to behold Antony him&s;elf following &s;oon after, leav|ing his fleet at the mercy of the conquerors; and the army at land &s;oon after followed their example.</P>
<P>When Cleopatra fled, Antony pur&s;ued her in a five-oared galley; and, coming along &s;ide of her &s;hip, entered it without &s;eeing, or being &s;een by her. She was in the &s;tern, and he went to the prow, where he remained for &s;ome time &s;ilent, hold|ing his head between his hands. In this manner he continued three whole days, during which, either
<PB N="191" REF="202">
through indignation or &s;hame, he neither &s;aw nor &s;poke to Cleopatra. At la&s;t, when they were arriv|ed at the promontory of Tenarus, the queen's female attendants reconciled them, and every thing went on as before. Still, however, he had the con&s;ola|tion to &s;uppo&s;e his army continued faithful to him; and accordingly di&s;patched orders to his lieutenant Canidius, to conduct it into A&s;ia. However, he was &s;oon undeceived when he arrived in Africa, where he was informed of their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his rival. This account &s;o tran&s;ported him with rage, that he was hardly prevented from killing him&s;elf; but at length, at the entreaty of his friends, he re|turned to Alexandria. Cleopatra, however, &s;eemed to retain that fortitude in her misfortunes, which had utterly abandoned her admirer. Having ama&s;&s;ed con&s;iderable riches, by means of confi&s;cations, and other acts of violence, &s;he formed a very &s;ingular and unheard of project: this was to convey her whole fleet over the i&s;thmus of Suez into the Red Sea, and thereby &s;ave her&s;elf in another region, beyond the reach of Rome, with all her trea&s;ures. Some of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r ve&s;&s;els were actually tran&s;ported thither, pur&s;uant to her orders; but the Arabians having burnt them, and Antony di&s;&s;uading her from the de&s;ign, &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it for the more improbable &s;cheme of de|fending Egypt again&s;t the conqueror. She omitted nothing in her power to put this advice in practice, and made all kinds of preparations for war; at lea&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> thereby to obtain better terms from Augu&s;tus. In fact, &s;he had always loved Antony's fortunes ra|ther than his per&s;on; and if &s;he could have fallen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> any method of &s;aving her&s;elf, though even at its expence, there is no doubt but &s;he would have embraced it with gladne&s;s.

<PB N="192" REF="203">
been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful with the greate&s;t men of Rome&punc; Thus, in three emba&s;&s;ies, which were &s;ent one after another, from Antony to Augu&s;tus in A&s;ia, the queen had always her &s;ecret agents, charged with particular propo&s;als in her name. Antony de&s;ired no more than that his life might be &s;pared, and to have the liberty of pa&s;&s;ing the remainder of his days in ob&s;curity. To tho&s;e propo&s;als Augu&s;tus made no reply. Cleopatra &s;ent him al&s;o public propo&s;als in favour of her children; but at the &s;ame time private|ly re&s;igned him her crown, with all the en&s;igns of royalty. To the queen's public propo&s;al, no an&s;wer was given: to her private offer he replied, by giving her a&s;&s;urances of his favour, in ca&s;e &s;he &s;ent away Antony, or put him to death. The&s;e negociations were not &s;o private but they came to the knowledge of Antony, who&s;e jealou&s;y and rage every occurrence now contributed to heighten. He built a &s;mall &s;o|litary hou&s;e upon a mole in the &s;ea, and there &s;hut him&s;elf up, a prey to all tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions that are the tor|mentors of un&s;ucce&s;sful tyranny. There he pa&s;t his time, &s;hunning all commerce with mankind, and profe&s;&s;ing to imitate Timon the man-hater. How|ever, his furious jealou&s;y drove him even from this retreat into &s;ociety; for hearing that Cleopatra had many &s;ec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> conferences with one Thyr&s;us, an emi&s;|&s;ary from Augu&s;tus, he &s;eized upon him, and hav|ing ordered him to be cruelly &s;courged, he &s;ent him back to his patron. At the &s;ame time he &s;ent let|ters by him, importing, that he had cha&s;tized Thyr|&s;us for in&s;ulting a man in misfortunes; but withal he gave Augu&s;tus permi&s;&s;ion to avenge him&s;elf, by &s;courging Hiparchus, Antony's freedman, in the &s;ame manner. The revenge, in this ca&s;e, would have been highly plea&s;ing to Antony, as Hiparchus h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> left him, to join the fortunes of his more &s;uc|ce&s;sful rival.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="204">Meanwhile, the operations of the war were car|ried vigorou&s;ly forward, and Egypt &s;oon after be|came again the theatre of the contending armies of Rome. Gallus, the lieutenant of Augu&s;tus, took Paretonium, which opened the whole country to his incur&s;ions. On the other &s;ide, Antony, who had &s;till con&s;iderable forces by &s;ea and land, wanted to take that important place from the enemy. He, therefore, marched towards it, flattering him&s;elf, that, as &s;oon as he &s;hould &s;hew him&s;elf to the le|gions which he had once commanded, the affection for their ancient general would revive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ed, therefore, and exhorted them to rem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> former vows of fidelity.

But the governor of the city, either wanting courage to defend it, or previou&s;ly in&s;truct|ed by Cleopatra to give it up, permitted him to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place; &s;o that Augu&s;tus had now no ob&s;tacle in his way to Alexandria, whither <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ched with all expedition.

This &s;light advantage once more revived his declining hopes; and, being naturally vain, he re|entered Alexandria in triumph Then going, all armed as he was, to the palace, he embraced Cleo|patra, and pre&s;ented her a &s;oldier who had di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him&s;elf in the late engagement. The queen rewarded him very magnificently; pre&s;enting him with an head piece and brea&s;t-plate of gold. With the&s;e, however, the &s;oldier went off the next night to the other army; prudently re&s;olving to &s;ecure his

Antony could not bear this defection without fre&s;h indigna|tion; he re&s;olved, therefore, to make a bold expiring effort by &s;ea and land, but previou&s;ly offered to fight his adver&s;ary in &s;ingle combat. Augu&s;tus too well knew the inequality of their &s;ituations, to comply with this forlorn offer; he only, therefore, coolly replied, that Antony had ways enough to die be&s;ides &s;ingle combat.</P>
<P>The day after, he po&s;ted the few troops he had re|maining, upon a ri&s;ing ground near the city; from whence he &s;ent order<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to his gallies to engage the enemy. There he waited to be a &s;pectator of the combat; and, at fir&s;t, he had the &s;tisfaction to &s;ee them advance in good order; but his approbation was &s;oon turned into rage, when he &s;aw his &s;hips on|ly &s;aluting tho&s;e of Augu&s;tus, and both fleets unit|ing together, and failing back into the harbour. At the very &s;ame time, his cavalry de&s;erted him. He tired, however, to lead on his infantry, which were ea&s;ily vanqui&s;hed; and he him&s;elf compelled to re|turn into the town.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXII. From the beginning of the reign of Augu&s;tus, to the death of Domitian, the la&s;t of the twelve Cae&s;ars.</HEAD>
<P>BY the death of Antony, Augu&s;tus was now be+come ma&s;ter of the Roman Empire. He &s;oon afte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> returned to Rome in triumph; where, by &s;umptu+ous fea&s;ts, and magnificent &s;hows, he began to ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i+terate the impre&s;&s;ions of his former cruelty; and from thence forward, re&s;olved to &s;ecure by his cle+mency, a throne, the foundations of which were laid in blood. He was now at the head of the mo&s;t ex|ten&s;ive empire that mankind had ever concurred i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> obeying The former &s;pirit of the Romans, and tho&s;e characteri&s;tic marks that di&s;tingui&s;hed them from others, were totally lo&s;t.

its members. However, it is very remarkable, that during the&s;e long contentions among them&s;elves, and the&s;e horrid deva&s;tations by civil war, the &s;tate was daily growing more formidable and powerful, and completed the de&s;truction of all the kings who pre|&s;umed to oppo&s;e it.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t care was to a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf of the friends of Antony; to which end he publicly reported that he had burnt all Antony's letters and papers, without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ing, convinced that, while any thought them|&s;elves &s;u&s;pected, they would be fearful of even offer|ing him their friend&s;hip</P>
<P>As he had gained the kingdom by his army, &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he re&s;olved to govern it by the &s;enate. This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, though greatly fallen from their ancient &s;plen|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&punc; he knew to be the be&s;t ordered, and mo&s;t capable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice.

By the&s;e means all the odium of ju&s;tice fell upon the &s;e|nate, and all the popularity of pardon was &s;olely his own. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s re&s;toring to the &s;enate their ancient &s;plendor, and di&s;countenancing all corruption, he pretended to re&s;erve to him&s;elf a very moderate &s;hare of authority, which none could refu&s;e him: namely, an a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ute power to compel all ranks of the &s;tate to do their duty. This, in fact, was re&s;erving ab&s;o|lute dom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nion in his own hands; but, the mi&s;guided p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ple began to look upon his moderation with a&s;to|ni&s;hment: they con&s;idered them&s;elves as re&s;tored to their former freedom, except in the capacity of pro|mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing &s;edition; and the &s;enate &s;uppo&s;ed their power re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in all things but their tendency to inju&s;tice. It was even &s;aid that the Romans, by &s;uch a government, lo&s;t nothing of the happine&s;s that liberty could produce; and were exempt from all the misfortunes it could occa&s;ion. This ob&s;ervation
<PB N="202" REF="212">
might have &s;ome truth under &s;uch a monarch as Augu&s;tus now appeared to be; but they were taught to change their &s;entiments under his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, when they found them&s;elves afflicted with all the puni&s;hments that tyranny could inflict or &s;edition make nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>After having e&s;tabli&s;hed this admirable order, Augu&s;tus found him&s;elf agitated by different inclina|tions; and con&s;idered a long time whether he &s;hould keep the empire or re&s;tore the people to their ancient liberty. But he adopted the advice of Maecenas, who de&s;ired him to continue in power, and was after|wards &s;wayed by him not only in this in&s;tance, but on every other occa&s;ion. By the in&s;tructions of that mini&s;ter, he became gentle, affable, and humane&punc; By his advice it was that he encouraged men of learning, and gave them much of his time and his friend&s;hip. They in their turn relieved his mo&s;t anxious hours, and circulated his prai&s;e through the empire.</P>
<P>Thus having given peace and happine&s;s to the empire, and being convinced of the attachment of all the orders of the &s;tate to his per&s;on, he re&s;olved upon impre&s;&s;ing the people with an idea of his mag|nanimity al&s;o. This was nothing le&s;s than making a &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">w of re&s;igning his authority; wherefore, having previ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;ly in&s;tracted his creatures it, the &s;enate how to act, he addre&s;&s;ed them in a &s;tudied &s;peech, im|porting the difficulty of governing &s;o exten&s;ive an empi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e a ta&s;k, which, he &s;aid, none but the im|mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> were equal to.

This power he repeatedly offered to re&s;tore, giving them to under&s;tand that the true &s;pirit of the Romans was not lo&s;t in him. This

&s;peech operated upon the &s;enate variou&s;ly, as they were more or le&s;s in the &s;ecret; many believed the &s;incerity of his profe&s;&s;ions, and, therefore, regarded his conduct as an act of unequalled heroi&s;m by any thing that had hitherto appeared in Rome; others, equal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y ignorant of his motives, di&s;tru&s;ted his de|&s;igns. Some there were who, having greatly &s;uffer|ed during the late popular commotions, were fearful of having them renewed; but the majority, who were entirely devoted to his intere&s;ts, and in&s;tructed by his mini&s;ters, frequently attempted to interrupt him while &s;peaking, and received his propo&s;al with pretended indignation. The&s;e unanimou&s;ly be&s;ought him not to re&s;ign the admini&s;tration; but upon his continuing to decline their reque&s;t, they in a man|ner compelled him to comply. However, that his per&s;on might be in greater &s;ecurity, they immediate|ly decreed the pay of his guard to be doubled. On the other hand, that he might &s;eem to make &s;ome conce&s;&s;ions on his &s;ide, he permitted the &s;enate to govern the weak internal provinces of the empire, while the mo&s;t powerful provinces, and tho&s;e that required the greate&s;t armies for their defence, were taken entirely under his own command. Over the&s;e he a&s;&s;umed the government but for ten years, leaving the people &s;till in hopes of regaining their antient freedom; but, at the &s;ame time, laying his mea&s;ures &s;o well, that his government was renewed every ten years to his death</P>
<P>This &s;hew of a re&s;ignation only &s;erved to confirm him in the empire and the hearts of the people. New honours were heaped upon him. He was then fir&s;t called Augu&s;tus; a name I have hitherto u&s;ed as t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at by which he is be&s;t known in hi&s;tory. A laurel was ordered to be planted at his gates. His hou&s;e was called the palace, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from that of ordinary citizens. He was confirmed in the title of father of his country, and his per&s;on declared &s;acred
<PB N="204" REF="215">
and inviolable. In &s;hort, flattery &s;eemed on the rack to find out new modes of plea&s;ing him, but though he de&s;pi&s;ed the arts of the &s;enate, he per|mitted their homage, well knowing that, among mankind, titles produce a re&s;pect which enforces au|thority.</P>
<P>Upon entering into his tenth con&s;ul&s;hip, the &s;e|nate, by oath, approved of all his acts, and &s;et him wholly above the power of the laws. They &s;ome time after offered to &s;wear to not only all the laws he had made, but &s;uch as he &s;hould make for the future. It was then cu&s;tomary with fathers upon their death|beds, to command their children to carry oblations to the Capitol, with this in&s;cription, that at the day of their deaths they left Augu&s;tus in health. It was determined that no man &s;hould be put to death on &s;uch days as the emperor entered the city. Upon a dearth of provi&s;ions, the people in a body entreated him to accept of the dictator&s;hip; but, though he undertook to be procurator of the provi&s;ions, he would by no means accept of the title of dictator, which had been aboli&s;hed by a law made when Antony was con&s;ul.</P>
<P>This accumulation of titles and employments, did not in the lea&s;t dimini&s;h his a&s;&s;iduity in filling the duties of each. Several very whole&s;ome edicts were pa&s;&s;ed by his command, tending to &s;uppre&s;s corrup|tion in the &s;enate, and licentiou&s;ne&s;s in the people. He ordained that none &s;hould exhibit a &s;how of gla|diators without orders from the &s;enate, and then no oftener than twice a year; nor with more than a hundred and twenty at a time. This law was ex|tremely nece&s;&s;ary at &s;o corrupt a period of the em|pire, when whole armies of the&s;e unfortunate men were brought at once upon the &s;tage, and compelled to fight, often till half of them were &s;lain.

<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="U.C." N="765"> <MILESTONE UNIT="A.D." N="15">  Tiberius was fifty-&s;ix years old when he took upon him the government of the Ro|man empire. He had long lived in a pro|found &s;tate of di&s;&s;imulation under Au|gu&s;tus, and was not yet hardy enough to &s;hew him|&s;elf in his real character. In the beginning of his reign nothing appeared but prudence, genero&s;ity, and clemency. But the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of Germanicus, his nephew, over the Germans, fir&s;t brought his na|tural di&s;po&s;itions to light, and di&s;covered the ma|lignity of his mind without di&s;gui&s;e. He &s;oon, therefore, began to con&s;ult on the mo&s;t &s;pecious means of humbling the popularity of Germanicus, and removing this object of his &s;u&s;picions. For this purpo&s;e, he di&s;patched Pi&s;o to Germanicus, a per&s;on of a furious and head&s;trong temper; and, in every re&s;pect, fit to execute tho&s;e fatal purpo&s;es for which he was de&s;igned. His in&s;tructions were to oppo&s;e Ger|manicus upon every occa&s;ion; and to excite all the hatred again&s;t him, which, without &s;u&s;picion, he could; and even to procure his death, if an oppor|tunity &s;hould offer. This agent &s;ucceeded, Ger|manicus died &s;oon after, and, as it was univer&s;ally believed, by poi&s;on.</P>
<P>Having now no object of jealou&s;y to keep him in awe, he began to pull off the ma&s;k entirely, and ap|pear more in his natural character than befo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e. In the beginning of his cruelties, he took into his con|fidence Sejanus, a Roman knight, who found out the method of gaining his confidence, by the mo&s;t re|fined degree of di&s;&s;imulation, being an overmatch for his ma&s;ter in his own arts. It is not well known whether he was the advi&s;er of all the cruelties that en|&s;ued

&s;oon after; but certain it is, that, from the be|ginning of his mini&s;try, Tiberius &s;eemed to become more fatally &s;u&s;picious.</P>
<P>Sejanus began by u&s;ing all his addre&s;s to per&s;uade Tiberius to retire to &s;ome agreeable retreat, remote from Rome.

But the rapidity of his ri&s;e &s;eemed only preparatory to the greatne&s;s of his downfall. All we know of his fir&s;t di&s;grace with the emperor is, that Satrius Secundus was the man who had the boldne&s;s to accu&s;e him of trea&s;on, and Antonia, the mother of Germanicus, &s;econded the accu&s;ation. The &s;enate, who had long been jealous of his power, and dreaded his cruelty, immediately took this opportunity of going beyond the orders of Tiberius, and in&s;tead of &s;entencing him to impri&s;on|ment, they directed his execution. As he was con|ducting to his fate, the people loaded him with in|&s;ult and execration.

However, his expedi|tion &s;eemed rather calculated for &s;hew than &s;ervice; the time he continued in Britain, which was in all but &s;ixteen days, was more taken up in receiving ho|mage, than extending his conque&s;ts. Great re|joicings were made upon his return to Rome: the &s;enate decreed him a &s;plendid triumph, triumphal arches were erected to his honour, and annual games in&s;tituted to commemorate his victories. In the mean time, the war was vigorou&s;ly pro&s;ecuted by Plautius and his lieutenant Ve&s;pa&s;ian, who, accord|ing to Suetonius, fought thirty battles with the ene|my, and by that means reduced a part of the i&s;land into the form of a Roman province.

This brave barbarian not only made a gallant defence, but often &s;eemed to claim a doubtful victory.

No|thing, however, that undi&s;ciplined valour could per|form, could avail again&s;t the conduct of the Roman legions. After an ob&s;tinate fight, the Britons were entirely routed; the wife and daughter of Caractacus were taken pri&s;oners; and he him&s;elf &s;eeking refuge from Curti&s;mandua, queen of the Brigantes, was treacherou&s;ly delivered up to the conquerors. When he was brought to Rome, nothing could exceed the curio&s;ity of the people, to behold a man who had, for &s;o many years, braved the power of the empire. On his part, he te&s;tified no marks of ba&s;e dejection; but, as he was led through the &s;treets, happening to ob&s;erve the &s;plendor of every object around him; "Alas," cried he, <Q>how is it po&s;&s;ible, that people po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch magnificence at home, could think of envying Caractacus an humble cottage in Britain!</Q> When he was brought before the em|peror, while the other captives &s;ued for pity, with the mo&s;t abject lamentations, Caractacus &s;tood before the tribunal with an intrepid air, and &s;eemed rather w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lling to accept of pardon, than meanly &s;olicitous of &s;uing for it.

The two mo&s;t remarkable per&s;onages who fell on this occa&s;ion were Seneca the philo&s;opher, and Lucan the poet, who was his nephew.

When this an&s;wer was brought to Nero, he demanded whether Seneca &s;eemed afraid to die: the tribune replying that he did not appear in the lea&s;t terrified; <Q>Then go to him again.</Q> cried the emperor, <Q>and give him my orders to die.</Q> Accordingly, he &s;ent a cen|turion to Seneca, &s;ignifying that it was the empe|ror's plea&s;ure that he &s;hould die.

Petronius could not endure the anxiety of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, wherefore he re&s;olved upon putting him&s;elf to death; which he performed in a manner entirely &s;imilar to that in which he had lived. He opened his veins, and then clo&s;ed them as he thought lea&s;t painful, with the utmo&s;t chearfulne&s;s and tranquility. He conver&s;ed with his friends, not upon maxims of philo&s;ophy, or grave &s;ubjects, but upon &s;uch topics as had amu&s;ed his gaye&s;t revels.

His journey, though &s;hort, was crowded with adventures. An earthquake gave him the fir&s;t alarm. The lightning from Heaven next fla&s;hed in his face.

During this interval, the &s;enate finding the praetorian guards had taken part with Galba, declared him em|peror, and condemned Nero to die, "more majorum;" that is, according to the rigour of the ancient laws.

<P>Otho, who was now elected emperor, began his reign by a &s;ignal in&s;tance of clemency, in pardoning Marius Cel&s;us, who had been highly favoured by Galba; and not contented with barely forgiving, he advanced him to the highe&s;t honours; a&s;&s;erting, that "fidelity de&s;erved every reward."</P>
<P>In the mean time, the legions in Lower Germany, having been purcha&s;ed by the large gifts and &s;pe|cious promi&s;es of Vitellius their general, were at length induced to proclaim him emperor; and, re|gardle&s;s of the &s;enate, they declared that they had an equal right to appoint to that high &s;tation, with the cohorts at Rome.</P>
<P>Otho departed from Rome with all ha&s;te to give Vitellius battle. The army of Vitellius, which con|&s;i&s;ted of &s;eventy thou&s;and men, was commanded by his generals Valens and Cecina, he him&s;elf remain|ing in Gaul, in order to bring up the re&s;t of his forces. Both &s;ides ha&s;tened to meet each other with &s;o much animo&s;ity and precipitation, that three con|&s;iderable battles were fought in the &s;pace of three days. One near Placentia, another near Cremona, and a third, at a place called Ca&s;tor; in all which, Otho and the Romans had the advantage. But the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es were but of &s;hort-lived continuance, for Valens and Cecinia, who had hitherto acted &s;epa|rately, joining their forces, and reinforcing their armies with fre&s;h &s;upplies, re&s;olved to come to a ge|neral engagement. In this, Otho's forces were to|tally overthrown, and he killed him&s;elf &s;hortly after, having reigned three months and five days.</P>
<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="A.D." N="70">  Vitellius was immediately after de|clared emperor by the &s;enate, and received the marks of di&s;tinction which were now accu&s;tom|ed to follow the appointments of the &s;tronge&s;t &s;ide.</P>

<P>In the mean time, Vitellius, who was wallowing in all kinds of luxury and exce&s;s, made offers to Ve&s;|pa&s;ian of re&s;igning the empire, provided his life were &s;pared, and a &s;ufficient revenue allotted for his &s;upport.

<P>During this fluctuation of coun&s;els, one Sabinus, who had advi&s;ed Vitellius to re&s;ign, perceiving his de&s;perate &s;ituation, re&s;olved, by a bold &s;tep, to oblige Ve&s;pa&s;ian; and accordingly &s;eized upon the Capitol. But he was premature in his attempt; for the &s;oldiers of Vitellius attacked him with great fury; and prevailing by their numbers, &s;oon laid that beautiful building in a&s;hes. During this dreadful conflagration, Vitellius was fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing in the palace of Tiberius, and beholding all the horrors of the a&s;|&s;ault with great &s;atisfaction. Sabinus was taken pri|&s;oner; and &s;hortly after executed by the emperor's command. Young Domitian, his nephew, who was afterwards emperor, e&s;caped by &s;light, in the habit of a prie&s;t; and all the re&s;t who &s;urvived the fire were put to the &s;word.</P>
<P>But Antonius, Ve&s;pa&s;ian's commander, being arrived before the walls of the city, the forces of Vi|tellius re&s;olved upon defending it to the utmo&s;t extremity. It was attacked, on three &s;ides, with
<PB N="243" REF="254">
the utmo&s;t fury; while the army within, &s;allying upon the be&s;iegers, defended it with equal ob&s;tinacy. The battle la&s;ted a whole day; till, at la&s;t, the be|&s;ieged were driven into the city, and a dreadful &s;laughter made of them in all the &s;treets which they vainly attempted to defend.</P>
<P>Vitellius was &s;oon &s;ound hidden in an ob&s;cure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r, from whence he was taken by a party of the conquering &s;oldiers. Still, however, willing to add a few hours more to his mi&s;erable life, he begged to be kept in pri&s;on till the arrival of Ve&s;pa&s;ian at Rome, pretending that he had &s;ecrets of importance to di&s;cover. But his intreaties were vain: the &s;ol|diers binding his hands behind him, and throwing an halter round his neck, led him along, half naked, into the public forum, upbraiding him, as they pro|ceeded, with all tho&s;e bitter reproaches their malice could &s;ugge&s;t, or his own cruelty might de&s;erve. At length, being come to the place of puni&s;hment, they killed him with many blows: and then dragging the dead body through the &s;treets with an hook, they threw it, with all po&s;&s;ible ignominy, into the river Tyb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r.</P>
<P>Ve&s;pa&s;ian was now declared emperor, <MILESTONE UNIT="A.D." N="70">   by the unanimous con&s;ent, both of the &s;enate and the army; and dignified with all tho&s;e titles, which now followed rather the power than the merit of tho&s;e who were appointed to govern.</P>
<P>Having continued &s;ome months at Alexandria, in Egypt, where, it is &s;aid, he cured a blind and a lime man by touching them, he &s;et out for Rome, giving his &s;on Titus the command of the army that was to lay &s;iege to Jeru&s;alem, while he him&s;elf went forward, and was met many miles from Rome by all the &s;enate, and near half the inhabitants, who gave the &s;incere&s;t te&s;timonies of their joy, in having an emperor of &s;uch great and experienced virtues Nor did he, in the lea&s;t, di&s;appoint their expectations;

being equally a&s;&s;iduous in rewarding merit, and pardoning his adver&s;aries; in reforming the manners of the citizens, and &s;etting them the be&s;t example in his own.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Titus carried on the war again&s;t the Jews with vigour. This ob&s;tinate and infatuated people had long re&s;olved to re&s;i&s;t the Roman power, vainly hoping to find protection from Heaven, which their impieties had utterly offended. Their own hi&s;torian repre&s;ents them, as arrived at the highe&s;t pitch of iniquity; while famines, earthquakes, and prodigies, all con&s;pired to forewarn their approaching ruin. Nor was it &s;ufficient that Heaven and earth &s;eemed combined again&s;t them; they had the mo&s;t bitter di&s;&s;en&s;ions among them&s;elves; and were &s;plit into two parties, that robbed and de&s;troyed each other with impunity; &s;till pillaging, and, at the &s;ame time, boa&s;ting their zeal for the religion of their an|ce&s;tors.</P>
<P>At the head of one of tho&s;e parties was an incen|diary, who&s;e name was John. This fanatic affect|ed &s;overeign power, and filled the whole city of Je|ru&s;alem, and all the towns around, with tumult and pillage. In a &s;hort time, a new faction aro&s;e, head|ed by one Simon, who gathering together multitudes of robbers and murderers, who had fled to the moun|tains, attacked many cities and towns, and reduced all Idumea into his power. Jeru&s;alem, at length, be|came the theatre in which the&s;e two demagogues be|gan to exerci&s;e their mutual animo&s;ity; John was po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of the temple, while Simon was admitted into the city; both equally enraged again&s;t each other; while &s;laughter and deva&s;tation followed their pre|ten&s;ions. Thus did a city, formerly celebrated for peace and unity, become the &s;eat of tumult and con|fu&s;ion.</P>
<P>It was in this mi&s;erable &s;ituation that Titus be|gan his operations within about &s;ix furlongs of the
<PB N="245" REF="256">
city of Jeru&s;alem, during the fea&s;t of the Pa&s;&s;|over, when the place was filled with an infinite mul|titude of people, who had come from all parts to ce|lebrate that great &s;olemnity. The approach of the Romans produced a temporary reconciliation be|tween the contending factions within the city; &s;o that they unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved to oppo&s;e the com|mon enemy fir&s;t, and then decide their dome&s;tic quarrels at a more convenient &s;ea&s;on Their fir&s;t f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lly, which was made with much fury and re&s;olution, put the be&s;iegers into great di&s;order, and obliged them to abandon their camp, and fly to the moun|tains. However, rallying immediately after, the Jews were forced back into the city; while Titus, in per&s;on, &s;hewed &s;urpri&s;ing in&s;tances of valour and conduct.</P>
<P>The&s;e advantages over the Romans, only renewed in the be&s;ieged their de&s;ires of private revenge. A tumult en&s;ued in the temple, in which &s;everal of both parties were &s;lain: and in this manner, upon every remi&s;&s;ion from without, the factions of John and Simon violently raged again&s;t each other within; agreeing only in their re&s;olution to defend the city again&s;t the Romans.</P>
<P>The city was &s;trongly fortified by three walls on every &s;ide, except where it was fenced by deep val|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es. Titus began by battering down the outward well, which, after much fatigue and danger, he effected; all the time &s;hewing the greate&s;t clemency to the Jews, and offering them repeated a&s;&s;urances of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. Five days after the commencement of the &s;iege. Titus broke through the &s;econd wall, and, though driven back by the be&s;ieged, he recovered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ground, and made preparations for battering the third wall, which was their la&s;t defence. But fir&s;t he &s;ent Jo&s;ephus, their countryman, into the city to exhort them to yield, who, u&s;ing all his eloquence to per&s;uade them, was only reviled with &s;coffs and
<PB N="246" REF="257">
reproaches. The &s;iege was now, therefore, carried on with greater vigour than before; &s;everal batteries for engines were rai&s;ed, which were no &s;ooner built, than de&s;troyed by the enemy. At length, it was re|&s;olved in council, to &s;urround the whole city with a trench, and thus prevent all relief and &s;uccours from abroad. This, which was quickly executed, &s;eem|ed no way to intimidate the Jews. Though famine and pe&s;tilence, its nece&s;&s;ary attendant, began now to make the mo&s;t horrid ravages among them, yet this de&s;perate people &s;till re&s;olved to hold out. He now cut down all the woods within a con&s;iderable di&s;tance of the city, and cau&s;ing more batteries to be rai&s;ed, he, at length, battered down the wall, and in five days entered the citadel by force. The Jews, however, continued to deceive them&s;elves with ab|&s;urd and fal&s;e expectations, while many fal&s;e pro|phets deluded the multitude, declaring, they &s;hould &s;oon have a&s;&s;i&s;tance from God. The heat of the battle was now, therefore, gathered round the inner wall of the temple, while the defendants de&s;perately combated from the top. Titus was willing to &s;ave this beautiful &s;tructure, but a &s;oldier ca&s;ting a brand into &s;ome adjacent buildings, the fire communicated to the temple, and, notwith&s;tanding the utmo&s;t en|deavours on both &s;ides, the whole edifice was quickly con&s;umed. The fight of the temple in ruins, effec|tually &s;erved to damp the ardour of the Jews. They now began to perceive, that Heaven had for&s;aken them, while their cries and lamentations echoed from the adjacent mountains. Even tho&s;e who were almo&s;t expiring, lifted up their dying eyes to bewail the lo&s;s of their temple, which they valued more than life it&s;elf. The mo&s;t re&s;olute, however, &s;till endeavoured to defend the upper and &s;tronger part of the city, named Sion; but Titus, with his bat|tering engines, &s;oon made him&s;elf entire ma&s;ter of the pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">. John and Simon were taken from the

The greate&s;t part of the populace were put to the &s;wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, and the city was, after a &s;ix month's &s;iege, entirely razed by the plough; &s;o that, according to our S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">viour's prophecy, not one &s;tone remained upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.

All things that were e&s;teemed valuable or beautiful among men, were brought to adorn this great oc|ca&s;ion. Among the rich &s;poils, were expo&s;ed va&s;t quantities of gold, taken out of the temple; but the book of the Holy Law was not the lea&s;t remarkable among the magnificent profu&s;ion. This was the fir&s;t time that ever Rome &s;aw the father and the &s;on triumph together.

<P>Lucius Antonius, governor of Upper Germany, knowing how much the emperor was dete&s;ted at home, re&s;olved upon &s;triking for the throne; and, accordingly, a&s;&s;umed the en&s;igns of imperial dignity.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII. The five good Emperors of Rome.  <MILESTONE REND="inBrackets" UNIT="A.D." N="96">  </HEAD>
<P>WHEN it was publicly known that Domi|tian was &s;lain, the &s;enate began to load his me|mory with every reproach. His &s;tatues were com|manded to be taken down; and a decree was made, that all his in&s;criptions &s;hould be era&s;ed, his name &s;truck out of the regi&s;ters of Fame, and his funeral omitted. The people, who now took little part in the affairs of government, looked on his death with indifference; the &s;oldiers alone, whom he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">aded with favours, and enriched by large&s;&s;es, &s;in|cerely regretted their benefactor.</P>
<P>The &s;enate, therefore, re&s;olved to provide a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or before the army could have an opportunity of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">king the appointment upon them&s;elves; and Coc|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ius Nerva was cho&s;en to the empire the vary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">y on watch the tyrant was &s;lain. He was of an illu&s;trious family, as mo&s;t &s;ay, by birth a Spaniard, and above f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ty-five years old when he was called to the throne. He was, at that time, the mo&s;t remarkable man in
<PB N="258" REF="269">
Rome, for his virtues, moderation, and re&s;pect to the laws; and he owed his exaltation to the blamele&s;s conduct of his former life.</P>
<P>The people being long accu&s;tomed to tyranny, they regarded Nerva's gentle reign with rapture, and even gave his imbecility (for his humanity was car|ried too far for ju&s;tice) the name of benevolence. Upon coming to the throne, he &s;olemnly &s;wore that no &s;enator of Rome &s;hould be put to death by his command, during his reign, though they gave never &s;o ju&s;t a cau&s;e. This oath he &s;o religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved, that when two &s;enators had con&s;pired his death, he u&s;ed no kind of &s;everity again&s;t them; but &s;ending for them, to let them &s;ee he was not ignorant of their de&s;igns, he carried them with him to the public theatre: there pre&s;enting each a dagger, he de&s;ired them to &s;trike, as he was determined not to ward off the blow.</P>
<P>During his &s;hort reign he made &s;everal good laws. He particularly prohibited the ca&s;tration of male children; which had been likewi&s;e condemned by his predece&s;&s;or, but not wholly removed. He put all tho&s;e &s;laves to death, who had, during the la&s;t reign, informed again&s;t their ma&s;ters. He permitted no &s;tatues to be erected in his honour, and converted &s;uch of Domitian's as had been &s;pared by the &s;enate, into money. He &s;old many rich robes, and much of the &s;plendid furniture of the palace, and retrench|ed &s;everal unrea&s;onable expences at court. At the &s;ame time, he had &s;o little regard for money, that when one of his &s;ubjects found a large trea&s;ure, and wrote to the emperor, how to di&s;po&s;e of it, he receiv|ed for an&s;wer, that he might u&s;e it; but the finder &s;till informing the emperor that it was a fortune too large for a private per&s;on, Nerva, admiring his hone&s;ty, wrote him word, that then he might abu&s;e it.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="270">A life of &s;uch genero&s;ity and mildne&s;s, was not, however, without its enemies; Vigilius Rufus, who had oppo&s;ed him, was not only pardoned, but made his colleague in the con&s;ul&s;hip Calpurnius Cra&s;&s;us al&s;o, with &s;ome others, formed a con&s;piracy to de|&s;troy him; but he re&s;ted &s;atisfied with bani&s;hing tho&s;e who were culpable, though the &s;enate were for inflicting more rigorous puni&s;hments. But the mo&s;t dangerous in&s;urrection again&s;t his intere&s;ts, was from the praetorian bands, who, headed by Ca&s;parius Olianus, in&s;i&s;ted upon revenging the late emperor's death, who&s;e memory was &s;till dear to them, from his frequent liberalities. Nerva, who&s;e kindne&s;s to good men rendered him more obnoxious to the vi|cious, did all in his power to &s;top the progre&s;s of this in&s;urrection; he pre&s;ented him&s;elf to the mutinous &s;oldiers, and opening his bo&s;om, de&s;ired them to &s;trike there, rather than be guility of &s;o &s;uch inju&s;tice. The &s;oldiers, however, paid no regard to his remon|&s;trances, but &s;eizing upon Petronius and Parthe|nius, &s;lew them in the mo&s;t ignominious manner. Not content with this, they even compelled the em|peror to approve of their &s;edition, and to make a &s;peech to the people, in which he thanked the cohorts for their fidelity.</P>
<P>So di&s;agreeable a con&s;traint upon the emperor's inclinations, was, in the end, attended with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> happy effects, as it cau&s;ed the adoption of Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ian to &s;ucceed him.

And in about three months after, having not him&s;elf into a violent pa&s;&s;ion with one Regulus, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;enator, he was &s;eized with a fever, of which he
<PB N="260" REF="271">
died, after a &s;hort reign of one year, four months, and nine days.</P>
<P>He was the fir&s;t foreign emperor who reigned in Rome, and ju&s;tly reputed a prince of great genero|&s;ity and moderation. He is al&s;o celebrated for his wi&s;dom, though with le&s;s rea&s;on, the greate&s;t in|&s;tance he gave of it during his reign, being the choice of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or.</P>
<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="U.C." N="851"> <MILESTONE UNIT="A.D." N="98">  Trajan's family was originally from Italy, but he him&s;elf was born at Seville, in Spain. Upon being informed of the death of Nerva, he prepared to return to Rome, from Germany, where he was governor: and one of the fir&s;t lectures he received, upon his arrival, was from Plutarch, the philo&s;opher, who had the honour of being his ma&s;ter, and is &s;aid to have written him a letter, to the following purpo&s;e: <Q>Since your me|rits, and not your importunities, have advanced you to the empire, permit me to congratulate your virtues, and my own good fortune. If your future government proves an&s;werable to your for|mer worth, I &s;hall be happy. But if you become wor&s;e for power, yours will be the danger, and mine the ignominy of your conduct. The errors of the pupil will be charged upon his in&s;tructor. Seneca is reproached for the enormities of Nero; and Socrates and Quintillian have not e&s;caped cen&s;ure for the mi&s;conduct of their re&s;pective &s;cholars. But you have it in your power to make me the mo&s;t honoured of men, by continuing what you are. Continue the command of your pa&s;&s;ions; and make virtue the &s;cope of all your actions. If you follow the&s;e in&s;tructions, then will I glory in my having pre&s;umed to give them; if you neglect what I offer, then will this letter be my te&s;timony that you have not erred through the council and authority of Plutarch.</Q> I have in&s;ert|ed
<PB N="261" REF="272">
this letter, whether genuine or not, becau&s;e it &s;eems to me well written; and a &s;triking picture of this greate&s;t philo&s;opher's manner of addre&s;&s;ing that be&s;t of princes.</P>
<P>This good monarch's application to bu&s;ine&s;s, his moderation to his enemies, his mode&s;ty in exaltation, his liberality to the de&s;erving, and his frugality in his own expences, have all been the &s;ubject of panegyric among his cotemporaries; and they continue to be the admiration of po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Upon giving the prefect of the praetorian bands the &s;word, according to cu&s;tom, he made u&s;e of this remarkable expre&s;&s;ion: <Q>Take this &s;word, and u&s;e it: if I have merit, for me; if otherwi&s;e, again&s;t me</Q> After which, he added, that he who gave laws was fir&s;t who was bound to ob&s;erve them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t war he was engaged in after his coming to the throne, was with the Dacians, who, during the reign of Domitian, had committed numberle&s;s ravages upon the provinces of the empire. He there|fore rai&s;ed a powerful army, and with great expedi|tion marched into tho&s;e barbarous countries, where he was vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by Decebalus, the Dacian king, who, for a long time, with&s;tood his bolde&s;t efforts. At length, however, this monarch being cn&s;trained to come to a general battle, and no longer able to protract the war, he was routed with great &s;laugther; though not without great lo&s;s to the con|queror. The Roman &s;oldiers, upon this occa&s;ion, wanting linen to bind up their wounds, the empe|ror tore his own robes to &s;upply them. This victory compelled the enemy to &s;ue for peace, which they obtained upon very di&s;advantageous terms; their king coming into the Roman camp, and acknowledging him&s;elf a va&s;&s;al of the Roman empire.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="273">Upon Trajan's return, after the u&s;ual triumphs and rejoicings upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion were over, he was &s;urpri&s;ed with an account, that the Dacians had renewed ho&s;tilities. Decebalus, their king, was now, therefore, a &s;econd time, adjudged an enemy to the Roman &s;tate, and Trajan invaded his domi|nions with an army equal to that with which he had be|fore &s;ubdued him. But Decebalus, now grown more cautious by his former defeat, u&s;ed every art to avoid coming to an engagement. He al&s;o put various &s;tra|tagems in practice, to di&s;tre&s;s the enemy; and, at one time, Trajan him&s;elf was in danger of being &s;lain or taken. He al&s;o took Longinus, one of the Roman generals, pri&s;oner, and threatened to kill him, in ca&s;e Trajan refu&s;ed granting him terms of peace. But the emperor replied, that peace and war had not their dependence upon the &s;afety of one &s;ub|ject only; wherefore Longinus, &s;ome time after, de|&s;troyed him&s;elf by a voluntary death. The &s;ate of this general &s;eemed to give new vigour to Trajan's ope|rations. In order to be better enabled to invade the enemy's territories at plea&s;ure, he undertook a mo&s;t &s;tupendous work, which was no le&s;s than building a bridge acro&s;s the Danube. This amazing &s;tructure, which was built over a deep, broad, and rapid river, con&s;i&s;ted of more than twenty-two arches, an hun|dred and fifty feet high, and an hundred and &s;eventy broad: the ruins of this &s;tructure, which remain to this day, &s;hew modern architects how far they were &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by the ancients, both in the greatne&s;s and the boldne&s;s of their de&s;igns. Upon fini&s;hing this work. Trajan continued the war with great vigour, &s;haring with the meane&s;t of his &s;oldiers the fatigues of the campaign, and continually encouraging them to their duty by his own example. By the&s;e means, notwith&s;tanding the country was &s;pacious and un|cultivated, and the inhabitants brave and hardy, he
<PB N="263" REF="274">
&s;ubdued the whole, and added the kingdom of Da|cia, as a province to the Roman empire. Deceba|lus made &s;ome attempts to e&s;cape, but being &s;ur|rounded on every &s;ide, he at la&s;t &s;lew him&s;elf, and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s head was &s;ent immediately to Rome, to certify his misfortune there. The&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es &s;eemed to ad|vance the empire to a greater degree of &s;plendour, that it had hitherto acquired.

<P>Having given peace and pro&s;perity to the empire, he continued his reign, loved, honoured, and almo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ted, by his &s;ubjects. He adorned the city with pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> buildings; he freed it from &s;uch men as lived at their vices, he entertained per&s;ons of merit with t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e utmo&s;t familiarity; and &s;o little feared his ene|mies, that he could &s;carcely be induced to &s;uppo&s;e he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> any.</P>
<P>It had been happy for this great prince's memory, if he had &s;hewn equal clemency to all his &s;ubjects; but, about the ninth year of his reign, he was per&s;uad|ed to look upon the Chri&s;tians with a &s;u&s;|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">s eye; <MILESTONE UNIT="U.C." N="860"> <MILESTONE UNIT="A.D." N="107">   and great numbers of them were put to death, as well by popular tumults as by edicts and judicial proceedings. How|ever, the per&s;ecution cea&s;ed after &s;ome time; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> emperor having advice from Pliny, the pro-con|&s;ul in Bithynia, of the innocence and &s;implicity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e Chri&s;tians, and of their inoffen&s;ive and moral way of living, he &s;u&s;pended their puni&s;hments.</P>
<P>During this emperor's reign, there was a dreadful in&s;urrection of the Jews in all parts of the empire. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wretched people, &s;till infatuated, and ever ex|pecting &s;ome &s;ignal deliverance, took the advantage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f Trajan's ab&s;ence in the Ea&s;t, in an expedition he
<PB N="264" REF="275">
had undertaken again&s;t the Armenians and Parthians, to ma&s;&s;acre all the Greeks, and Romans, which they got into their power, without reluctance or mercy. This rebellion fir&s;t began in Cyrene, a Roman pro|vince in Africa; from thence the flame extended to Egypt, and next to the i&s;land of Cyprus. The&s;e places, they, in a manner di&s;peopled with ungovern|able fury Their barbarities were &s;uch, that they eat the fle&s;h of their enemies, wore their &s;kins, &s;aw|ed them a&s;under, ca&s;t them to wild bea&s;ts, made them kill each other, and &s;tudied new torments by which to de&s;troy them. However, the&s;e cruelties were of no long duration; the governors of the re|&s;pective provinces making head again&s;t their tumul|tuous fury, &s;oon treated them with a retaliation of cruelty, and put them to death, not as human be|ings, but as outrageous pe&s;ts to &s;ociety. As the Jews had practi&s;ed their cruelties in Cyprus par|ticularly, a law was publicly enacted, by which it was made capital for any Jew to &s;et foot on the i&s;land.</P>
<P>During the&s;e bloody tran&s;actions, Trajan was pro|&s;ecuting his &s;ucce&s;&s;es in the Ea&s;t, where he carried the Roman arms farther than they had ever been before: but re&s;olving to return once more to Rome, he found him&s;elf too weak to proceed in his u&s;ual manner. He therefore ordered him&s;elf to be carried on &s;hipboard, to the city of Salcucia, where he died of the apoplexy, <MILESTONE UNIT="A.D." N="117">   having been at|tacked by that di&s;order once before, in the &s;ixty-third year of his age, after a reign of nine|teen years, &s;ix months, and fifteen days.</P>
<P>Adrian, who was nephew to Trajan, was adopted to &s;ucceed in the empire, and elected by all orders of the &s;tate, though ab&s;ent from Rome, being then at Antioch, as general of the forces in the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Upon his election, he began to pur&s;ue a cour&s;e quite oppo&s;ite to that of his predece&s;&s;or, taking every
<PB N="265" REF="276">
method of declining war, and promoting the arts of peace. He was quite &s;atisfied with pre&s;erving the ancient limits of the empire, and &s;eemed no way ambitious of exten&s;ive conque&s;t.</P>
<P>Adrian was one of the mo&s;t remarkable of the Ro|man emperors for the variety of his endowments. He was highly &s;kilful in all the accompli&s;hments both of body and mind. He compo&s;ed with great beauty, both in pro&s;e and ver&s;e; he pleaded at the bar, and was one of the be&s;t orators of his time. Nor were his moral virtues le&s;s than his ac|compli&s;hments. His moderation and clemency ap|peared by pardoning the injuries which he had re|ceived when he was yet but a private man. One day meeting a per&s;on who had formerly been his mo&s;t in|veterate enemy, "My good friend," cried he, "you have e&s;caped, for I am made emperor." He was affable to his friends, and gentle to per&s;ons of meaner &s;tations; he relieved their wants, and vi&s;ited them in &s;ickne&s;s; it being his con&s;tant maxim, that he was an emperor not elected for his own good, but for the benefit of mankind.</P>
<P>The&s;e were his virtues, which were contra&s;ted by a &s;trange mixture of vices; or, to &s;ay the truth, he wanted &s;trength of mind to pre&s;erve his general rec|titude of character without deviation.</P>
<P>He was &s;carce &s;ettled on the throne, when &s;everal of the northern barbarians, the Alani, the Sarma|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">s, and the Dacians, began to make deva&s;tations o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the empire. The&s;e hardy nations, who now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">und the way to conquer, by i&s;&s;uing from their fo|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ts, and then retiring upon the approach of a &s;u|perior force oppo&s;ing them, began to be truly for|midable to Rome. Adrian had thoughts of contract|ing the limits of the empire, by giving up &s;ome of the mo&s;t remote and lea&s;t defen&s;ible provinces; but in this he was over-ruled by his friends, who wrongly imagined that an exten&s;ive frontier would intimidate
<PB N="266" REF="277">
an invading enemy. But though he complied with their remon&s;trances, he broke down the bridge over the Danube, which his predece&s;&s;or had built, &s;en|&s;ible that the &s;ame pa&s;&s;age which was open to him; was equally convenient to the incur&s;ions of his bar|barous neighbours.</P>
<P>Having &s;tayed a &s;hort time at Rome, &s;o as to &s;ee that all things were regulated and e&s;tabli&s;hed for the &s;afety of the public, he prepared to vi&s;it and take a view of his whole empire. It was one of his maxims, that an emperor ought to imitate the &s;un, which diffu&s;es warmth and vigour over all parts of the earth. He therefore took with him a &s;plendid court, and a con&s;iderable force, and entered the province of Gaul, where he numbered all the inhabitants. From Gaul he went into Germany, from thence to Holland, and then pa&s;&s;ed over into Britain. There reforming many abu&s;es, and reconciling the natives to the Ro|mans; for the better &s;ecurity of the &s;outhern parts of the kingdom, he built a wall of wood and earth, ex|tending from the river Eden in Cumberland, to the Tyne in Northumberland, to prevent the incur&s;ions of the Picts, and the other barbarous nations to the north. From Britain, returning through Gaul, he directed his journey to Spain, where he was received with great joy, as being a native of that country. There, wintering in the city of Tarragona, he call|ed a meeting of the deputies from all the provinces, and ordained many things for the benefit of the na|tion. From Spain, returning to Rome, he continu|ed there for &s;ome time, in order to prepare for his journey into the ea&s;t, which was ha&s;tened by a new inva&s;ion of the Parthians. His approach compelling the enemy to peace, he pur&s;ued his travels without mole&s;tation. Arriving in A&s;ia Minor, he turned out of his way to vi&s;it the famous city of Athens. There making a con&s;iderable &s;tay, he was initiated into the Eleu&s;inian my&s;teries, which were account|ed
<PB N="267" REF="278">
the mo&s;t &s;acred in the pagan mythology; and took upon him the office of archon, or chief magi&s;trate of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> place.

He was even &s;o far reconciled to them, as to think of receiving Chri&s;t among the number of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">s. After a winter's continuance at Athens, he went over into Sicily: and vi&s;ited Aetna, and the other curio&s;ities of the place. Returning from thence once more to Rome, after a &s;hort &s;tay, he prepared &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ips, and cro&s;&s;ed over into Africa. There he &s;pent much time in regulating abu&s;es, and reforming the government; in deciding controver&s;ies, and erecting magnificent buildings. Among the re&s;t, he ordered Carthage to be rebuilt; calling it, after his own name, Adrianople. Again returning to Rome, where he &s;tayed but a very little time, he travelled a &s;econd time into Greece; pa&s;&s;ed over into A&s;ia Mi|nor; from thence went into Syria, gave laws and in&s;tructions to all the neighbouring kings, whom he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ited to come and con&s;ult with him; he then en|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed Pale&s;tine, Arabia, and Egypt, where he cau&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Pompey's tomb, that had been long neglected, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> almo&s;t covered with &s;and, to be renewed and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">tified.

<P>THE merits of Aurelius procured Commodus an ea&s;y acce&s;&s;ion to the throne. He was acknowledged emperor, fir&s;t by the army, then by the &s;enate and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ple, and &s;hortly after by all the provinces.</P>
<P>His whole reign is but a ti&s;&s;ue of wantonne&s;s and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, cruelty and inju&s;tice, rapacity and corrup|tion.

<P>He went with his a&s;&s;ociate to taverns and brothels; &s;pent the day in fea&s;ting, and the night in the mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">minable luxuries, having no le&s;s than three hun|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed females, and as many males, for dete&s;table pur|po&s;es. He committed ince&s;t, as Caligula did, with
<PB N="278" REF="291">
all his &s;i&s;ters. He &s;ometimes went about the mar|kets in a frolic, with &s;mall wares, as a petty chap|man; &s;ometimes he imitated a hor&s;e-cour&s;er; and, at other times, drove his own chariot in a &s;lave's ha|bit; while tho&s;e he chiefly promoted re&s;embled him|&s;elf, being the companions of his plea&s;ures, or the mini&s;ters of his cruelty.</P>
<P>If any per&s;on de&s;ired to be revenged on an enemy, by bargaining with Commodus for a &s;um of money, he was permitted to de&s;troy him in &s;uch manner as he thought proper. He com|manded a per&s;on to be ca&s;t to the wild bea&s;ts, for reading the life of Caligula in Suetonius. He or|dered another to be thrown in a burning furnace, for accidentally over-heating his bath. He would &s;ome|times, when he was in a good humour, cut off men's no&s;es, under a pretence of &s;having their beards; and yet he was him&s;elf &s;o jealous of all mankind, that he was obliged to be his own barber.</P>
<P>At length, upon the fea&s;t of Janus, re&s;olving to fence naked before the people, as a common gladia|tor, three of his friends remon&s;trated to him upon the indecency of &s;uch a behaviour. The&s;e were Laetius, his general, Electus, his chamberlain, and Marcia, a concubine, of whom he always appeared exce&s;&s;ively fond. Their advice was attended with no other of act, than that of incoming him again&s;t them, and inciting him to re&s;olve upon their de&s;truction. It was his method, like that of Domitian, to &s;et down the name of all &s;uch as he intended to put to death, in a roll, which he carefully kept by him. However, at this time, happening to lay the roll on his bed, while he was bathing in another room, it was taken up by a little boy, whom he pa&s;&s;ionately loved. The child after playing with it for &s;ome time, brought it to Marcia, who was in&s;tantly alarmed at the contents. She immediately di&s;covered her ter|rors to Laetus and Electus, who perceiving their dan|gerous
<PB N="279" REF="292">
&s;ituation, in&s;tantly re&s;olved the tyrant's death. After &s;ome deliberation, it was agreed upon to di&s;|patch him by poi&s;on; but this not &s;ucceeding, Marcia ha&s;tily introduced a young man, called Narci&s;&s;us, and prevailed upon him to a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;trangling the tyrant. Commodus died in the thirty fir&s;t year of his age, after an impious reign of twelve years and nine months.</P>
<P>The &s;ecrecy and expedition with which Commodus was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated were &s;uch, that few were at that time, <MILESTONE UNIT="U.C." N="945"> <MILESTONE UNIT="A.D." N="192">   ac|quainted with the real circum&s;tances of his death. His body was wrapped up as a bale of u&s;ele&s;s furni|ture, and carried through the guards, mo&s;t of whom were either drunk or a&s;leep.</P>
<P>Previous to the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, the con&s;pirators had fixed upon a &s;ucce&s;&s;or. Helvius Pertinax, who&s;e virtues and courage rendered him worthy of the mo&s;t exalted &s;tation, and who had pa&s;&s;ed through many changes of fortune, was fixed upon to &s;ucceed him; when, therefore, the con&s;pirators repaired to his hou&s;e to &s;alute him emperor, he con&s;idered their arrival as a command from the emperor Commodus for his death. Upon Laetus entering his apartment, Pertinax, without any &s;hew of fear, cried out, that for many days he had expected to end his life in that manner, wondering that the emperor had deferred it to long. However, he was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed when informed of the real cau&s;e of their vi&s;it; and being &s;trongly urged to accept of the empire, he, at la&s;t, complied with their offer.</P>
<P>Bring carried to the camp, Pertinax was pro|claimed emperor, and &s;oon after the citizens and &s;enate con&s;ented; their joy at the election of their n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w &s;overeign being &s;carce equal to that for the death of their tyrant. They then pronounced Commodus a parricide; an enemy to the gods, his country, and all mankind; and commanded, that his corp&s;e &s;hould rot upon a dunghill. In the mean time, they
<PB N="280" REF="293">
&s;aluted Pertinax as emperor and Cae&s;ar, with numer|ous acclamations, and chearfully took the oaths of obedience. The provinces &s;oon after followed the example of Rome; &s;o that he began his reign with univer&s;al &s;atisfaction to the whole empire, in the &s;ixty-eight year of his age.</P>
<P>Nothing could exceed the ju&s;tice and wi&s;dom of this monarch's reign, the &s;hort time it continued. But the praetorian &s;oldiers, where maners he had at|tempted to reform, having been long corrupted by the indulgence and profu&s;ion of their former mo|narch, began to hate him, for the par&s;imony and di&s;cipline he had introduced among them. They therefore re&s;olved to dethrone him; and according|ly, in a tumu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tuous manner, marched through the &s;treets of Rome, entered his palace without oppo&s;i|tion, where a Tungrian &s;oldier &s;truck him dead with a blow of his lance. From the number of his ad|ventures, he was called the Tennis-ball of Fortune; and certainly no man eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> experienced &s;uch a variety of &s;ituations, with &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> blamele&s;s a character.

<P>It &s;hould &s;eem by this weak monarch's conduct, when &s;eated on the throne, that he thought the go|vernment of an empire rather a plea&s;ure, than a toil. In&s;tead of attempting to gain the hearts of his &s;ub|jects, he gave him&s;elf up to ea&s;e and inactivity, ut|terly regardle&s;s of the duties of his &s;tation. He was mild and gentle indeed, neither injuring any, nor expecting to be injured. But that avarice, by which he became opulent, &s;till followed him in his exalta|tion; &s;o that the very &s;oldiers who elected him, &s;oon began to dete&s;t him for tho&s;e qualities, &s;o very oppo|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e to a military character. The people al&s;o, again&s;t who&s;e con&s;ent he was cho&s;en, were not le&s;s his ene|mies. Whenever he i&s;&s;ued from his palace, they openly poured forth their imprecations again&s;t him, crying out, that he was a thief, and had &s;tolen the empire. Didius, however, in the true &s;pirit of a trader, patiently bore all their reproach, &s;ome|times beckoning to them, with &s;miles, to approach him, and te&s;tifying his regard by every kind of &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Soon after Severus, an African by birth, being proclaimed by his army, began by promi&s;ing to re|ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge the death of Pertinax</P>
<P>Didius, upon being informed of his approach to|wards Rome, obtained the con&s;ent of the &s;enate to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> him amba&s;&s;adors&punc; offering to make him a part|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in the empire. But Severus rejected this offer, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ious of his own &s;trength, and of the weakne&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the propo&s;er. The &s;enate &s;oon appeared of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;entiments, and perceiving the timidity and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of their pre&s;ent ma&s;ter, abandoned him.
<PB N="282" REF="295">
Being called together, as was formerly practi&s;ed in the times of the commonwealth, by the con&s;uls, they unanimou&s;ly decreed, that Didius &s;hould be depriv|ed of the empire, and that Severus &s;hould be pro|claimed in his &s;tead. They commanded Didius to be &s;lain, and &s;ent me&s;&s;engers for this purpo&s;e to the palace, where they found him di&s;armed, and di&s;|patched him, among a few friends, that &s;till adhered to his intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Severus having overcome Niger and Albinus, who were his competitors for the empire, under|took next the reins of government, uniting great vigour with the mo&s;t refined policy; yet his Afri|can cunning, for he was a native of Africa, was con&s;idered as a particular defect in him. He is celebrated for his wit, learning, and prudence; but equally blamed for perfidy and cruelty. In &s;hort, he &s;eemed equally capable of the greate&s;t acts of vir|tue, and the mo&s;t bloody &s;everities.</P>
<P>Upon his return to Rome, he loaded his &s;oldiers with rewards and honours, giving them &s;uch privi|leges as &s;trengthened his own power, while they de|&s;troyed that of the &s;tate. For the &s;oldiers, who had hitherto &s;hewed the &s;tronge&s;t inclinations to an abu&s;e of power, were now made arbiters of the fate of emperors.</P>
<P>Being thus &s;ecure of his army, he re&s;olved to give way to his natural turn for conque&s;t, and to op|po&s;e his arms again&s;t the Parthians, who were then invading the frontiers of the empire. Having, therefore, previou&s;ly given the government of do|me&s;tic policy to one Plautian, a particular favourite, to who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e daughter he married his &s;on Caracalla, he &s;et out for the ca&s;t, and pro&s;ecuted the war with his u&s;ual expedition and &s;ucce&s;s. He forced &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion from the king of Armenia, de&s;troyed &s;everal cities in Arabia <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elix, landed on the Parthian coa&s;ts, took
<PB N="283" REF="296">
and plundered the famous city of Cte&s;iphon, marched back through Pale&s;tine and Egypt, and at length re|turned to Rome in triumph.</P>
<P>During this interval, Plautian, who was left to direct the affairs of Rome, began to think of a&s;piring to the empire him&s;elf. Upon the emperor's return, he employed a tribune of the praetorian cohorts, of which he was the commander, to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him; as likewi&s;e his &s;on, Caracalla. The tribune informed Severus of his favourite's treachery. He at fir&s;t re|ceived it as an improbable &s;tory, and as the artifice of one who envied his favourite's fortune. However, he was at la&s;t per&s;uaded to permit the tribune to con|duct Plautian to the emperor's apartments, to be a te&s;ti|mony again&s;t him&s;elf. With this intent, the tri|bune went and amu&s;ed him with a pretended account of his killing the emperor and his &s;on; de&s;iring him, if he thought fit to &s;ee him dead, to go with him to the palace. As Plautian ardently de&s;ired their deaths, he readily gave credit to his relation, and following the tribune, was conducted, at midnight, into the innermo&s;t rece&s;&s;es. But what mu&s;t have been his di&s;appointment, when, in&s;tead of finding the empe|ror lying dead, as he expected, he beheld the room lighted up with torches, and Severus, &s;urrounded by his friends, prepared in array to receive him. Be|ing a&s;ked by the emperor, with a &s;tern countenance, what had brought him there, at that un&s;ea&s;onable time; he was, at fir&s;t, utterly confounded, and, not knowing what excu&s;e to make, he ingenuou&s;ly con|fe&s;&s;ed the whole, intreating forgivene&s;s for what he h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d intended. The emperor &s;eemed inclined to pardon; but Caracalla, his &s;on, who, from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rlie&s;t age, &s;hewed a di&s;po&s;ition to cruelty, with his &s;word ran him through the body.</P>
<P>After this, he &s;pent a con&s;iderable time in vi&s;it|ing &s;ome cities in Italy, permitting none of his offi|cers
<PB N="284" REF="297">
to &s;ell places of tru&s;t or dignity, and di&s;tributing ju&s;tice with the &s;tricte&s;t impartiality. He then un|dertook an expedition into Britain, where the Ro|mans were in danger of being de&s;troyed, or com|pelled to fly the province. Wherefore, after ap|pointing his two &s;ons, Caracalla and Geta, joint &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in the empire, and taking them with him, he landed in Britain, to the great terror of &s;uch as had drawn down his re&s;entment. Upon his progre&s;s into the country, he left his &s;on Geta in the &s;outhern part of the province, which had continued in obe|dience, and marched, with his &s;on Caracalla, again&s;t the Caledonians. In this expedition, his army &s;uf|fered prodigious hard&s;hips in pur&s;uing the enemy; they were obliged to hew their way through intricate fore&s;ts, to drain exten&s;ive mar&s;hes, and form bridges over rapid rivers; &s;o that he lo&s;t fifty thou&s;and men by fatigue and &s;ickne&s;s. However, he &s;upported all the&s;e inconveniencies with unrelenting bravery; and pro&s;ecuted his &s;ucce&s;&s;es with &s;uch vigour, that he compelled the enemy to beg for peace; which they obtained, not without the &s;urrender of a con|&s;iderable part of their country. It was there, that for its better &s;ecurity, he built that famous wall, which &s;till goes by his name, extending from Solway Frith, on the we&s;t, to the German ocean, on the ea&s;t. He did not long &s;urvive his &s;ucce&s;&s;es here, but died at York, in the &s;ixty &s;ixth year of his age, after an ac|tive, though cruel, reign, of about eighteen years</P>

<P>His tyrannies, at length, excited the re&s;entment of Macrinus, the commander of the forces in Me&s;o|potamia, who employed one Martial, a man of great &s;trength, and a centurion of the guards, to di&s;patch him.

His wife's bracelet u&s;ually &s;erved him for a thumb ring; and his &s;trength was &s;o great, that he was able to draw a carriage which two oxen could not move. He could &s;trike out a hor&s;e's teeth, with a blow of his fi&s;t; and break its thigh with a kick. His diet was as extraordinary as the re&s;t of his endow|ments: he generally eat forty pounds weight of fle&s;h every day, and drank &s;ix gallons of wine, without committing any debauch in either. With a frame &s;o athletic, he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a mind undaunted in danger, and neither fearing nor regarding any man. The fir&s;t time he was made known was to the empe|ror Severus, who was then celebrating games on the birth day of his &s;on Geta.

<P>However, his cruelties did not retard his military operations, which were carried on with a &s;pirit be|coming a better monarch. He overthrew the Ger|mans in &s;everal battles, wa&s;ted all their country with fire and &s;word for four hundred miles together, and &s;et a re&s;olution of &s;ubduing all the northern nations as far as the ocean. In the&s;e expeditions, in order to attach the &s;oldiers more firmly to him, he encrea&s;ed their pay; and in every duty of the camp, he him&s;elf took as much pains as the meane&s;t centinel in his army, &s;hewing incredible courage and a&s;&s;iduity. In every engagement, wherever the conflict was hotte&s;t, Maximin was always &s;een fighting there in per&s;on, and de&s;troying all before him: for, being bred a barbarian, he con&s;idered it as his duty to combat as a common &s;oldier, while he commanded as a general.</P>

<P>But no virtues could now prevent the approaching downfall of the &s;tate: the ob&s;tinate di&s;putes between the Pagans and the Chri&s;tians within the empire, and the uncea&s;ing irruptions of barbarous nations from without, enfeebled it beyond the power of remedy.

But reformation was then grown almo&s;t im|practicable. The Per&s;ians, under their king Sapor, invaded Syria, and coming into Me&s;opotamia, took the unfortunate Valerian pri&s;oner, as he was making preparations to oppo&s;e them. Nothing can exceed the indignities, as well as the cruelties, which were practi&s;ed upon this unhappy monarch, thus fallen in|to the hands of his enemies. Sapor, we are told, always u&s;ed him as a foot&s;tool for mounting his hor&s;e; he added the bitterne&s;s of ridicule to his in|&s;ults,

<P>In this general calamity, Galienus, though at fir&s;t &s;eemingly in&s;en&s;ible, was, at length, obliged, for his own private &s;ecurity, to take the field, and led an army to be&s;iege the city of Milan, which had been taken by one of the thirty u&s;urping tyrants.

This active monarch was born of mean and ob&s;cure paren|tage in Dacia, and was about fifty-five years old at the time of his coming to the throne. He had &s;pent the early part of his life in the army, and had ri&s;en through all the gradations of military duty.

<P>Upon the death of Tacitus, the whole army, as if by common con&s;ent, cried out that Probus &s;hould be emperor.

He began early to di&s;tingui&s;h him|&s;elf for his di&s;cipline and valour; being frequently the fir&s;t man that, in be&s;ieging towns, &s;caled the walls, or that bur&s;t into the enemy's camp.

He therefore, the day following, cau&s;ed a royal &s;tandard to be made, like that which he had &s;een in the heavens, and commanded it to be carried before him in his wars, as an en&s;ign of victory and cele&s;tial protection. After this, he con&s;ulted with &s;everal of the principal teachers of Chri&s;tianity, and made a public avowal of that &s;acred per&s;ua&s;ion.</P>
<P>Con&s;tantine having thus attached his &s;oldiers to his intere&s;t, who were mo&s;tly of the Chri&s;tian per|&s;ua&s;ion, lo&s;t no time in entering Italy, with ninety thou&s;and foot, and eight thou&s;and hor&s;e; and &s;oon advanced almo&s;t to the very gates of Rome.

The engagement was, for &s;ome time, fierce and bloody, till his cavalry being rout|ed, victory declared upon the &s;ide of his opponent, and he him&s;elf was drowned in his flight, by the breaking down of a bridge, as he attempted to cro&s;s the Tiber.</P>
<P>Con&s;tantine, in con&s;equence of this victory, en|tering the city, di&s;claimed all prai&s;es which the &s;e|nate and people were ready to offer; a&s;cribing his &s;ucce&s;s to a &s;uperior power.

<P>Things continued in this &s;tate for &s;ome time, Con&s;tantine contributing what was in his power to the intere&s;t of religion, and the revival of learning, which had long been upon the decline, and was al|mo&s;t wholly extinct in the empire. But in the mid&s;t of the&s;e a&s;&s;iduities, the peace of the empire was again di&s;turbed by the preparations of Maximin, who go|verned in the Ea&s;t; and who, de&s;irous of a full par+ticipation of power, marched again&s;t Licinius, with a very numerous army. In con&s;equence of this &s;tep, after many conflicts, a general engagement en&s;ued, in which Maximin &s;uffered a total defeat; many of his troops were cut to pieces, and tho&s;e that &s;urvived &s;ubmitted to the conqueror. Having, however, e&s;caped the general carnage, he once more put him|&s;elf at the head of another army, re&s;olving to try the fortune of the field; but his death prevented the de|&s;ign. As he died by a very extraordinary kind of madne&s;s, the Chri&s;tians, of whom he was the de|clared enemy, did not fail to a&s;cribe his end to a judgment from Heaven; but this was the age in which fal&s;e judgments and fal&s;e miracles, made up the bulk of unin&s;tructive hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Con&s;tantine and Licinius thus remaining undi&s;|puted po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors and partners in the empire&punc; all things promi&s;ed a peaceable continuance of friend&s;hip and power. However, it was &s;oon found, that the &s;ame ambition that aimed after a part, would be content

with nothing le&s;s than the whole Pagan writers a&s;cribe the rupture, between the&s;e two potentates, to Con&s;tantine; while the Chri&s;tians, on the other hand, impute it wholly to Licinius. Both &s;ides exerted all their power to make oppo&s;ition; and, at the head of very formidable armies, came to an en|gagement near Cybalis, in Pannonia. Con&s;tantine, previous to the battle, in the mid&s;t of his Chri&s;tian bi&s;hops, begged the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Heaven; while Li|cinius, with equal zeal, called upon the pagan prie&s;ts to intercede with the gods in his &s;avour. The &s;uc|ce&s;s was on the &s;ide of truth: Con&s;tantine, after an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, became victorious; took the enemy's camp; and, after &s;ome time compelled Li|cinius to &s;ue for a truce, which was agreed upon. But this was of no long continuance; for &s;oon after the war breaking out afre&s;h, and the rivals coming once more to a general engagement, it proved deci|&s;ive. Licinius was entirely defeated, and pur&s;ued by Con&s;tantine into Nicomedia, where he &s;urrender|ed him&s;elf up to the victor; having fir&s;t obtained an oath that his life &s;hould be &s;pared, and that he &s;hould be permitted to pa&s;s the remainder of his days in re|tirement This, however, Con&s;tantine &s;hortly after broke; for either fearing his de&s;igns, or finding him actually engaged in fre&s;h con&s;piracies, he command|ed him to be put to death, together with Martian, his general, who, &s;ome time before, had been created Cae&s;ar.</P>
<P>Con&s;tantine being thus &s;ole monarch of the em|pire, re&s;olved to e&s;tabli&s;h Chri&s;tianity on &s;o &s;ure a ba&s;is, that no new revolutions &s;hould &s;hake it. He commanded that in all the provinces of the empire the orders of the bi&s;hops &s;hould be exactly obeyed. He called al&s;o a general council of the&s;e, in order to repre&s;s the here&s;ies that had already crept into the church, particularly that of Arius. To this place re|paired about three hundred and eighteen bi&s;hops,

be&s;ides a multitude of pre&s;byters and deacons, to|gether with the emperor him&s;elf; who all, except about &s;eventeen, concurred in condemning the tenets of Arius; and this here&s;iarch, with his a&s;&s;ociates, was bani&s;hed into a remote part of the empire.</P>
<P>Having thus re&s;tored univer&s;al tranquility to the empire, he was not able to ward off the calamities of a more dome&s;tic nature. As the wretched hi&s;tories of this period are entirely at variance with each other, it is not ea&s;y to tell the motives which induced him to put his wife Fau&s;ta and his &s;on Cri&s;pus to death. The mo&s;t plau&s;ible account is this. Fau&s;ta, the em|pre&s;s, who was a woman of great beauty, but of ex|travagant de&s;ires, had long, though &s;ecretly, loved Cri&s;pus, Con&s;tantine's &s;on by a former wife. She had tried every art to in&s;pire this youth with a mu|tual pa&s;&s;ion; and finding her more di&s;tant efforts in|effectual, had even the confidence to make him an open confe&s;&s;ion of her de&s;ires. This produced an ex|planation, which was fatal to both. Cri&s;pus receiv|ed her addre&s;&s;es with dete&s;tation; and &s;he, to be re|venged, accu&s;ed him to the emperor. Con&s;tantine, fired at once with jealou&s;y and rage, ordered him to die without an hearing, nor did his innocence ap|pear till it was too late for redre&s;s. The only repa|ration therefore that remained, was the putting Fau&s;ta, the wicked in&s;trument of his former cruelty, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eath: which was accordingly executed upon her, together with &s;ome others, who had been accomplices in her fal&s;ehood and treachery.</P>
<P>But it is &s;uppo&s;ed that all the good he did was not equal to recompence the evil the empire &s;u&s;tained by his transferring the &s;eat of it from Rome to Byzan|tium, or Con&s;tantinople, as it was afterwards called. Whatever might have been the rea&s;ons which induc|ed him to this undertaking; whether it was becau&s;e he was offended at &s;ome affronts he had received at
<PB N="303" REF="316">
Rome, or that he &s;uppo&s;ed Con&s;tantinople more in the centre of the empire; or that he thought the ea&s;tern parts more required his pre&s;ence; experience has &s;hewn that they were all weak and groundle&s;s. The empire had long before been in a mo&s;t declining &s;tate; but this, in a great mea&s;ure, gave precipita|tion to its downfall. After this it never re&s;umed its former &s;plendor, but, like a flower tran&s;planted into a foreign clime, langui&s;hed by degrees, and at length &s;unk into nothing.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t de&s;ign was to build a city, which he might make the capital of the world; and for this purpo&s;e, he made choice of a &s;ituation at Chalcedon in A&s;ia Minor; but we are told, that in laying out the ground plan, an eagle caught up the line, and &s;lew with it over to Byzantium, a city, which lay upon the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the Bo&s;phorus. Here, therefore, it was thought expedient to fix the &s;eat of empire; and, indeed, nature &s;eemed to have formed it with all the conveniencies, and all the beauties, which might induce power to make it the &s;eat of re&s;idence. It was &s;ituated on a plain, that ro&s;e gently from the water: it commanded that &s;treight which unites the Mediterranean with the Euxine &s;ea, and was fur|ni&s;hed with all the advantages which the mo&s;t indul|gent climate could be&s;tow. This city, therefore, <MILESTONE UNIT="U.C." N="1084"> <MILESTONE UNIT="A.D." N="330">   he beautified with the mo&s;t magnificent edifices; he divided it into fourteen regions; built a capitol, an amphitheatre, many churches, and other public works; and, hav|ing thus rendered it equal to the magnificence of his idea, he dedicated it in a very &s;olemn manner to the God of martyrs; and in about two years after repair|ed thither with his whole court.</P>
<P>This removal produced no immediate alteration in the government of the empire; the inhabitants of Rome, though with reluctance, &s;ubmitted to the change; nor was there for two or three years any

di&s;turbance in the &s;tate, until, at length, the Goths finding that the Romans had withdrawn all their gar|ri&s;ons along the Danube, renewed their inroads, and ravaged the country with unheard of cruelty.

<P>FROM from this dreary period the recovery of the empire was become de&s;perate; no wi&s;dom could obviate its decadence, no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> oppo&s;e the evils
<PB N="305" REF="318">
that &s;urrounded it on every &s;ide. Were we to enter into a detail concerning the characters of the princes of tho&s;e times, it &s;hould be rather of the conquerors, not the conquered; of tho&s;e Gothic chiefs who led a more virtuous and more courageous people to the conque&s;t of nations corrupted by vice and enervated by luxury.</P>
<P>The&s;e barbarians were at fir&s;t unknown to the Ro|mans, and for &s;ome time after had been only incom|modious to them. But they we now become for|midable, and aro&s;e in &s;uch numbers, that the earth &s;eemed to produce a new race of mankind, to com|plete the empire's de&s;truction. They had been in|crea&s;ing in their hideous de&s;erts, amid&s;t regions frightful with eternal &s;nows, and had long only wait|ed the opportunity of coming down into a more fa|vourable climate. Again&s;t &s;uch an enemy no courage could avail, nor abilities be &s;ucce&s;sful; a victory only cut off numbers without an habitation, and a name, &s;oon to be &s;ucceeded by others equally de&s;perate and ob&s;cure.</P>
<P>The emperors who had to contend with this peo|ple, were mo&s;t of them furni&s;hed neither with courage nor conduct to oppo&s;e. Their re&s;idence in A&s;ia &s;eemed to enervate their manners, and pro|duced a de&s;ire in them to be adored like the monarchs of the Ea&s;t. Sunk in &s;oftne&s;s, they &s;hewed them|&s;elves with le&s;s frequency to the &s;oldiers, they became more indolent, fonder of dome&s;tic plea|&s;ures, and more ab&s;tracted from the empire. Con|&s;tantius, who reigned thirty-eight years, was weak, timid, and un&s;ucce&s;sful; governed by his eunuchs and his wives; and unfit to prop the falling em|pire. Julian, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, &s;urnamed the Apo&s;tate, upon account of his relap&s;ing into pagani&s;m, was, notwith&s;tanding, a very good and a very valiant prince. He, by his wi&s;dom, conduct, and oeco|nomy,
<PB N="306" REF="319">
cha&s;ed the barbarians, that had taken fifty towns upon the Rhine, out of their new &s;ettlements; and his name was a terror to them during his reign, which la&s;ted but two years. Jovian and Valen|tinian had virtue and &s;trength &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve the empire from immediately falling under its ene|mies. No prince &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;toring the ancient plan of the empire more than Valentinian; the former emperors had drained away all the fron|tier garri&s;ons, merely to &s;trengthen their own power at home; but his whole life was employed in fortify|ing the banks of the Rhine; making levies, rai&s;ing ca&s;tles, placing troops in proper &s;tations, and fur|ni&s;hing them with &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for their &s;upport; but an event, that no human prudence could fore|&s;ee, brought up a new enemy to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the univer|&s;al de&s;truction.</P>
<P>That tract of land which lies between the Palus Maeotis, the mountains of Cauca&s;us and the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, was inhabited by a numerous &s;avage people, that went by the name of the Huns and Allanes. Their &s;oil was fertile, and the inhabitants fond of robbery and plunder. As they imagined it imprac|ticable to cro&s;s the Palus Maeotis, they were alto|gether unacquainted with the Romans, &s;o that they remained confined within the limits their ignor|ance had a&s;&s;igned them, while other nations plun|dered with &s;ecurity. It has been the opinion of &s;ome, that the &s;lime which was rolled down by the current of the Tanais, had, by degrees, formed a kind of it cru&s;tation on the &s;urface of the Cimmae|rian Bo&s;phorus, over which the&s;e people are &s;up|po&s;ed to have pa&s;&s;ed. Others relate that two young Sevthians, being in full pur&s;uit of an heifer, the terrified creature, &s;wam over an arm of the &s;ea, and the youths immediately following her, found them&s;elves in a new world, upon the oppo&s;ite
<PB N="307" REF="320">
&s;hore. Upon their return, they did not fail to re|late the wonders of the &s;trange lands and countries, which they had di&s;covered. Upon their informa|tion, an innumerable body of Huns pa&s;&s;ed tho&s;e &s;treights, and meeting fir&s;t with the Goths, made that people &s;ly before them. The Goths, in con&s;ter|nation, pre&s;ented them&s;elves on the banks of the Danube, and, with a &s;uppliant air, entreated the Romans to allow them a place of refuge. This they ea&s;ily obtained from Valens, who a&s;&s;igned them &s;everal portions of land in Thrace, but left them de&s;titute of all needful &s;upplies. Stimulated, therefore, by hunger and re&s;entment, they &s;oon af|ter ro&s;e again&s;t their protectors, and, in a dreadful engagement, which was fought near Adrianople, they de&s;troyed Valens him&s;elf, and the greate&s;t part of his army.</P>
<P>It was in this manner the Roman armies grew weaker; &s;o that the emperors, finding it difficult, at la&s;t, to rai&s;e levies in the provinces, were obliged to hire one body of barbarians to oppo&s;e another. This expedient had its u&s;e in circum&s;tances of imme|diate danger; but when that was over, the Romans found it was as difficult to rid them&s;elves of their new allies, as of their former enemies Thus the empire was not ruined by any particular inva&s;ion, but &s;unk gradually under the weight of &s;everal at|tacks made upon it on every &s;ide. When the bar|barians had wa&s;ted one province, tho&s;e who &s;ucceed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the fir&s;t &s;poilers, proceeded on to another. Their deva&s;tations were at fir&s;t limited to Thrace, My<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ia, and Pannonia; but when the&s;e countries were ruined, they de&s;troyed Macedonia, The&s;&s;aly, and Greece; and from thence they expatiated to Noricum. The empire was in this manner continually &s;hrinking, and Italy, at la&s;t, became the frontier of its own dominion.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="321">The valour and conduct of Theodo&s;ius, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, retarded the de&s;truction that had begun in the time of Valens, but upon his death the enemy became irre&s;i&s;tible. A large body of Goths had been called in to a&s;&s;i&s;t the regular forces of the empire, under the command of Alaric, their king; but what was brought in to &s;top the univer&s;al decline proved the mo&s;t mortal &s;tab to its &s;ecurity. This Gothic prince, who is repre&s;ented as brave, impe|tuous, and enterprizing, perceiving the weakne&s;s of the &s;tate, and how little Arcadius and Honorius, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Theodo&s;ius, were able to &s;ecure it; being in&s;tigated al&s;o, &s;till farther, by the artifices of one Rufinus, who had de&s;igns upon the throne him&s;elf; this warlike prince, I &s;ay, putting him|&s;elf at the head of his barbarous forces, declared war again&s;t his employers, and fought the armies of the empire for &s;ome years with various &s;ucce&s;s. However, in proportion as his troops were cut off, he received new &s;upplies from his native fore&s;ts; and, at length, putting his mighty de&s;igns in execu|tion, pa&s;&s;ed the Alps, and poured down, like a tor|rent, among the fruitful vallies of Italy. This charming region had long been the &s;eat of indolence and &s;en&s;ual delight; its fields were now turned into gardens of plea&s;ure, that only &s;erved to enervate the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, from having once been a nur&s;ery of mi|litary &s;trength, that furni&s;hed &s;oldiers for the conque&s;t of mankind The timid inhabitants, therefore, be|held, with terror, a dreadful enemy ravaging in the mid&s;t of their country, while their wretched emperor, Honorious, who was then in Ravenna, &s;till only &s;eemed re&s;olved to keep up his dignity, and to refu&s;e any accommodation. But the inhabitants of Rome felt the calamities of the times with double aggravation. This great city, that had long &s;ate as mi&s;tre&s;s of the world, now &s;aw her&s;elf be&s;ieged
<PB N="309" REF="322">
by an army of fierce and terrible barbarians; and be|ing crowded with inhabitants, it was reduced, by the extremities of pe&s;tilence and famine, to a mo&s;t deplorable &s;ituation. In this extremity the &s;enate di&s;patched their amba&s;&s;adors to Alaric, de&s;iring him either to grant them peace upon rea&s;onable terms, or to give them leave to fight it with him, in the open field. To this me&s;&s;age, however, the Gothic monarch only replied, with a bur&s;t of laughter, "that thick gra&s;s was ea&s;ier cut than thin:" im|plying, that their troops, when cooped up within the narrow compa&s;s of the city, would be more ea&s;ily overcome, than when drawn out in order of battle. When they came to debate about a peace, he de|manded all their riches, and all their &s;laves. When he was a&s;ked, "what then he would leave them;' he &s;ternly replied, "their lives." The&s;e were hard conditions for &s;uch a celebrated city to accept; but, compelled by the nece&s;&s;ity of the times, they rai&s;ed an immen&s;e trea&s;ure, both by taxation and &s;tripping the heathen temples; and thus, at length, bought off their fierce invader. But this was but a temporary removal of the calamity; for Alaric now finding that he might become ma&s;ter of Rome whenever he thought proper, returned with his army, a &s;hort time after; pre&s;&s;ed it more clo&s;ely than he had done before, and at la&s;t took it; <MILESTONE UNIT="U.C." N="1163"> <MILESTONE UNIT="A.D." N="410">   but whether by force or &s;tratagem, is not agreed among hi&s;torians. Thus, that city which for ages had plundered the re&s;t of the world, and enriched her&s;elf with the &s;poils of mankind, now felt, in turn, the &s;ad rever&s;e of fortune, and &s;uffered all that barbarity could in|flict, or patience endure. The &s;oldiers had free liberty to pillage all places except the Chri&s;tian churches; and, in the mid&s;t of this horrible de|&s;olation, &s;o great was the reverence of the&s;e bar|barians
<PB N="310" REF="323">
for our holy religion, that the pagan Ro|mans found &s;afety in applying to tho&s;e of the Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ian per&s;ua&s;ion for protection. This dread|ful deva&s;tation continued for three days; and un|&s;peakable were the precious monuments, both of art and learning, that &s;unk under the fury of the conquerors. However, there were &s;till number|le&s;s traces of the city's former greatne&s;s; &s;o that this capture &s;eemed rather a correction, than a total overthrow.</P>
<P>But the Gothic conquerors of the We&s;t, though they had &s;uffered Rome to &s;urvive its fir&s;t capture, now found how ea&s;y it was to become ma&s;ters of it upon any other occa&s;ion. The extent of its walls had, in fact, made it almo&s;t impracticable for the inhabitants to defend them; and, as it was &s;ituated in a plain, it might be &s;tormed without much dif|ficulty. Be&s;ides this, no &s;uccours were to be ex|pected from without; for the number of the people was &s;o extremely dimini&s;hed, that the emperors were obliged to retire to Ravenna; a place &s;o forti|fied by nature, that they could be &s;afe without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an army. What Alaric, therefore, &s;pared, Ge&s;neric, king of the Vandals, not long after contributed to de&s;troy: his mercile&s;s &s;oldiers, for fourteen days together, ravaged with implacable fury, in the mid&s;t of that venerable place. Neither private dwellings, nor public buildings, neither &s;ex, nor age, nor religion, were the lea&s;t protection again&s;t their lu&s;t or avarice.</P>
<P>The capital of the empire being thus ran&s;acked &s;everal times, and Italy over-run by barbarous in|vaders, under various denominations, from the remote&s;t &s;kirts of Europe; the we&s;tern emperors, for &s;ome time, continued to hold the title without the power of royalty. Honorius lived till he &s;aw him&s;elf &s;tripped of the greate&s;t part of his domi|nions;
<PB N="311" REF="324">
his capital taken by the Goths; the Huns &s;eized of Pannonia; the Alans, Suevi, and Vandals e&s;tabli&s;hed in Spain; and the Burgundians &s;ettled in Gaul, where the Goths al&s;o fixed them&s;elves at la&s;t. After &s;ome time, the inhabitants of Rome al&s;o, being abandoned by their princes, feebly at|tempted to take the &s;upreme power into their own hands. Armorica and Britain, &s;eeing them&s;elves for&s;aken, began to regulate them&s;elves by their own laws. Thus the power of the &s;tate was entirely broken, and tho&s;e who a&s;&s;umed the title of emperors, only encountered certain de&s;truction. At length, even the very name of emperor of the We&s;t expired upon the abdication of Augu&s;tulus; and Odoacer, general of the Heruli, a&s;&s;umed the title of king of all Italy. Such was the end of this great empire, that had conquered mankind with its arms, and in|&s;tructed the world with its wi&s;dom; that had ri&s;en by temperance, and that fell by luxury; that had been e&s;tabli&s;hed by a &s;pirit of patrioti&s;m, and that &s;unk into ruin when the empire was become &s;o exten|&s;ive, that a Roman citizen was but an empty name. Its final di&s;&s;olution happened about five hundred and twenty-two years after the battle of Phar&s;alia; an hundred and forty-&s;ix after the re|moval of the imperial &s;eat to Con&s;tantinople; and four hundred and &s;eventy-&s;ix after the nativity of our Saviour.</P>
