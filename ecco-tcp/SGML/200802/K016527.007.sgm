<P>_YOU enjoined me, my dear Lady G. at parting on Monday la&s;t, to write to you; and to be very particular in what I wrote. I will, becau&s;e I love and fear you. Otherwi&s;e I would not write at all; fir&s;t, becau&s;e I had not the good fortune to plea&s;e you, in mine to Lady L.; and next, becau&s;e I &s;hall &s;o &s;oon have the honour to attend you in town. Well then, I begin.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day we women were employed in prepa|rations for the tenants jubilee, next day. Sir Charles, attended by my brother, paid a morning vi&s;it to Mr. Greville, whom he found moody, re&s;erved, and
<PB N="2" REF="3">
indi&s;po&s;ed. My brother James &s;ays, that he never &s;aw &s;uch a manly, yet tender treatment, from one man to another, as Sir Charles gave him; and that he ab&s;olutely &s;ubdued him, and left him acknowledge|ing the favour of his vi&s;it, and begging a repetition of it, as often as he could, while he &s;taid in the&s;e parts; and that, he &s;aid, as well for his credit, as for his com|fort. But when, Sir Charles, &s;aid he, do you carry from us the Syren? I <HI>will</HI> call her names. I hate her. The &s;ooner the better. Cur&s;e me, if I &s;hall be able to creep out of the hou&s;e, while &s;he is vi&s;ible on Northampton&s;hire ground&mdash;Tho' I was a friend to the match&mdash;Do you mind that, young man (to my brother James): O Love! Love! added he, of what contradictions art thou the cau&s;e! Tho' I hate her, I almo&s;t long to &s;ee her. You'll allow me to vi&s;it you both, I hope when I have got over the&s;e plaguy megrims?</P>
<P>The &s;ame day Sir Charles making a friendly vi&s;it, as going by Sir John Holles's &s;eat, to that family, found Mi&s;s Orme there, expecting her brother to call for her in his po&s;t-chai&s;e.</P>
<P>Great civilities pa&s;&s;ed between Sir Charles and Mi&s;s Orme. She was doubtful whether her brother had, at that time, be&s;t &s;ee Sir Charles, as he was weak in health and Spirits: But ju&s;t as Sir Charles was at the gate, going to his chariot, attended by Sir John and the young Ladies, poor Mr. Orme came.</P>
<P>The Liveries would not allow Mr. Orme to doubt who it was. He turned pale. Sir Charles addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to him with his u&s;ual polite freedom. Know|ing, Sir, &s;aid he, that Mr. Orme was expected by one of the be&s;t of Si&s;ters, I pre&s;ume to &s;alute you, as the Mr. Orme to whom I have been de&s;irous, ever &s;ince I have been in Northampton&s;hire, to pay my compliments.</P>
<P>Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, Sir&mdash;</P>
<P>At your &s;ervice, Mr. Orme; taking his hand.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4">
The happie&s;t man in the world, replied Mr. Orme, with &s;ome emotion. The be&s;t, the lovelie&s;t woman on earth calls you hers.</P>
<P>I <HI>am,</HI> I think my&s;elf, the happie&s;t of men. But it will add to my joy, to have it wi&s;hed me by &s;o good a man as Mr. Orme.</P>
<P>Ah, Sir!&mdash;Could I wi&s;h joy to any man on this occa&s;ion, it would be to you, becau&s;e of your cha|racter; and in the reflection, that the mo&s;t excellent of women mu&s;t be happier with you, than any other man could have made her. But Self, Self, Sir! <HI>He</HI> is indeed a hero, who, with &s;uch a &s;ervent attach|ment as mine, can dive&s;t him&s;elf of Self. I loved her, Sir, from her early infancy, and never knew another Love.</P>
<P>The man, Mr. Orme, who loved Mi&s;s Byron, gave di&s;tinction to him&s;elf. Permit me to pre&s;ent her to you, and you to her, as dear friends; and allow me a third place in your friend&s;hip. You have a &s;i&s;ter who ju&s;tly claims a &s;econd. I dare en|gage for the dear creature, from what I know of her value for Mr. Orme, that &s;he will allow of this friend&s;hip, on the foot of his own merits, were my recommendation out of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>O Sir Charles! you are, you <HI>ought</HI> to be, the man. And will you allow me on the&s;e terms to vi&s;it <HI>you,</HI> and vi&s;it <HI>her?</HI>&mdash;But, alas! I fear, I fear, I cannot &s;oon&mdash;</P>
<P>At your own time, my dear Mr. Orme.&mdash;At Mr. Selby's; at her hou&s;e in London; in Hamp&s;hire; where-ever &s;he is, and whether I am pre&s;ent or ab|&s;ent, Mr. Orme will be received as <HI>her</HI> brother and <HI>my</HI> brother, as <HI>her</HI> friend and <HI>my</HI> friend.</P>
<P>Good God! Good God!&mdash;He gu&s;hed into tears. He ran into the hou&s;e to hide his emotion; but in vain; for when he went in, he wept like a child!&mdash;Forgive me, forgive me, Sir John! (who ju&s;t then came in from taking leave of his noble gue&s;t) but
<PB N="4" REF="5">
there is no bearing this man's magnanimity!&mdash;He is all I have heard of him. Happy, happy Mi&s;s By|ron!&mdash;No man but this could de&s;erve her. But where is he? ri&s;ing: I will a&s;k his pardon for my abrupt departure from him.</P>
<P>He is gone, an&s;wered Sir John. I &s;aw him in his chariot! Good Mr. Orme! he called you, and &s;ighed for you. Poor Mr. Orme declared, that he would wait upon Sir Charles, and tell him, how acceptable to his heart, and what balm to his mind, would be the tender he had the goodne&s;s to make him. Si&s;ter, &s;aid he, you were at the gate, as well as the young Ladies; did he not hint, did he not &s;ay, that Mi&s;s By|ron &s;poke of me with tenderne&s;s?</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Kitty Holles &s;upplied to us afterwards my bro|ther's account of what pa&s;&s;ed in this accidental inter|view. The&s;e dear girls know not how to keep from Selby-hou&s;e. They are good girls; how then can they help admiring Sir Charles Grandi&s;on?</P>
<P>I begin to fancy I am in a way to plea&s;e you, Lady G. Of which&punc; at taking up my pen, I had little hopes, and therefore intended not to take much pains about it. But the &s;ubject mu&s;t warm the colde&s;t genius. Is it not of your brother, and my cou&s;in?</P>
<P>In the afternoon, a Letter was brought from Sir Rowland Meredith. My cou&s;in intends to &s;hew it to you in town. Such a mix are in it, of joy and &s;adne&s;s; of condolement and congratulation; I be|lieve was never &s;een in one &s;heet of paper. It is dated from Wind&s;or. The good man was there in his way to town; re&s;olving to pay a vi&s;it to the <HI>wonderful man,</HI> as he calls <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">im, of whom he had heard &s;o great a character; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nd who was probably to be the hu&s;band of his daug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">r Byron; and there he heard (from Lord W's do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;tics I &s;uppo&s;e) that Sir Charles was in Northampton&s;hire, and that the mar|riage was actually &s;olemnized. He therefore intended
<PB N="5" REF="6">
to &s;et out directly for Bath, where Mr. Fowler was, or at the Hot-well at Bri&s;tol, pur&s;uing mea&s;ures for his health; with a view to con&s;ole his <HI>poor boy.</HI></P>
<P>This is a good old man. Methinks I am half ready to wi&s;h, that &s;ome of my cou&s;in's admirers would dry up their tears, and come among us: Yet we are nice and dainty girls, &s;ome of us, let me tell you.&mdash;Tis fooli&s;h, however, to &s;ugge&s;t <HI>leavings,</HI> and &s;uch &s;ort of &s;tuff; the Lady &s;uch as but one man could de&s;erve; <HI>his</HI> merit allowed univer&s;ally.</P>
<P>Sir Charles acquainted his Lady with all that had pa&s;&s;ed between him and Mr. Orme. She received his account with joy and thankfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>You are enter'd, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, into a numerous family. I have called Sir Rowland Meredith my Fa|ther; Mr. Fowler my Brother. Be plea&s;ed to read this Letter.</P>
<P>I remember the relation, my dear, returned Sir Charles, and acknowledge it. Mr. Fowler is another Mr. Orme. Sir Rowland is a very worthy man.</P>
<P>He read it&mdash;What an excellent heart has Sir Row|land! My deare&s;t Love! cultivate their friend&s;hip&punc; as I will Mr. Orme's. My pity for the&s;e worthy ob|jects, joining with yours, and the frankne&s;s of our mutual behaviour to them, will &s;trengthen their hearts. We owe it to them, my deare&s;t Life, as much as it is in our power, to &s;often their di&s;appoint|ment.&mdash;Could they have a greater?</P>
<P>O my Lady G! Who can think of a man after this&mdash;Except one might hope, from the per&s;onal knowledge of his charming behaviour, that the men who addre&s;&s;ed us, might be improved by &s;uch an example?</P>
<P>The Tenants Jubilee, as they called it, was on Wedne&s;day. It was a much more orderly day than we expected. Sir Charles was all conde&s;cen&s;ion and chearful goodne&s;s: My cou&s;in all <HI>graciou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> was the word for her. Mrs. Shirley was of the company
<PB N="6" REF="7">
How was &s;he reverenced! She ever was! Once when the bride was withdrawn, and Sir Charles was en|gaged in talk with Mr. Deane, &s;he whi&s;pered two or three of her tenants to tell the re&s;t, that it was great joy to her, to be a&s;&s;ured, that after her departure, the tenants of her dear Mr. Shirley would be treated with as much kindne&s;s (perhaps with more) as he, and as &s;he, after his example, had ever treated them. Yet one caution, I give, &s;aid &s;he: My dear &s;on will &s;ee with his own eyes: He will di&s;pen&s;e with his own hands. He will not be impo&s;ed upon.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day and Friday the Bride &s;aw company. There was as little both days of the impertinence that attends form, as, I believe, was ever known on the like occa&s;ion; but more of &s;incere admiration. We had a va&s;t number of people. Some of them per&s;ons of fa&s;hion, with whom we had but &s;lender acquaintance; but who wi&s;hed to &s;ee the happy pair.</P>
<P>We &s;hall be this day at Shirley-manor in a family way: In <HI>that,</HI> my dear Lady G. (after all the bu&s;tle and parade that we can make) lies the true, becau&s;e the untumultuous joy.</P>
<P>To-morrow we &s;hall &s;erve God in our u&s;ual way.</P>

<P>COME, come, Lucy, you do pretty well. Don't be di&s;heartned, child. Yet you are not <HI>quite</HI> the clever girl I once thought you. You, that held
<PB N="7" REF="8">
&s;uch a part in the corre&s;pondence of our Harriet.&mdash;But you &s;ay, you can't help it. Poor girl! I am &s;orry for it. Your talents lie in &s;peech, not in writing.&mdash;Your account of the interview between Orme and my brother, &s;hews you can't <HI>write at all.</HI> No, not you&mdash;Poor Lucy! But write one Letter more before you come to town. Do! my dear! You have charming &s;ubjects before you, yet.</P>
<P>I, you &s;ee, have a talent to make &s;ubjects out of <HI>nothing:</HI> You, poor &s;oul! can't follow them when made to your hand. I'll tell you a &s;tory of my good man and his good woman. A &s;hort one. The poor man is very &s;en&s;ible of &s;light ailments. Happy, as <HI>he</HI> is, in a wife, no wonder he is afraid of dying. He was complaining to me ju&s;t now [To whom but to a pitying wife &s;hould a man complain when he ails any-thing?] that he had a trouble&s;ome di&s;order in the in&s;ide of his mouth. I looked very grave; &s;hook my careful head. I am afraid, my Lord, &s;omething is breeding there, that &s;hould not. He &s;tarted, and looked concerned. The man will never know me. God &s;orbid! &s;aid he&mdash;afraid of nothing le&s;s than a cancer. Have I not told you a thou&s;and times, my Lord, of your gaping? As &s;ure as you are alive, your mouth is fly-blown.</P>
<P>Expecting compa&s;&s;ion, he found a je&s;t, and never was man &s;o angry. I was forced to take his hand, and &s;troke his cheeks with mine, to be friends.</P>
<P>But, Lucy, let not any of the&s;e flippances meet my brother's eye, or invade his ear: I &s;hall be un|done if they do.</P>
<P>Caroline is pure well. Her Lord is never out either of her chamber, or the nur&s;ery.</P>
<P>Aunt Nell makes an admirable nur&s;e. Her parrot and her &s;quirrel are now neglected for a little mar|mou&s;et. Every-body but the real nur&s;e likes aunt Nell. The good creature is &s;o <HI>under&s;tanding,</HI> &s;o
<PB N="8" REF="9">
directing! I prote&s;t, the&s;e old maids think they know every-thing. The nur&s;e, I &s;ee, can't endure her.</P>
<P>I interfere not. The boy is robu&s;t, and they leave him the free exerci&s;e of his limbs, and he has a fine pipe, and makes the nur&s;ery ring whenever he plea&s;es; &s;o will do well enough.</P>
<P>But high-ho, Lucy! all the&s;e nur&s;ery memento's, how do they &s;adden and mortify me! The word <HI>mother,</HI> what a &s;olemn &s;ound has it to me now; Caro|line's &s;ituation before me!&mdash;But, come, the evil day is at di&s;tance: Who's afraid?</P>
<P>Beauchamp &s;ighs for Emily: Emily for &s;omebody el&s;e. Sir Hargrave is &s;till mi&s;erable. Poor Sir Har|ry! He &s;till lives! But can life be life, when there is no hope?</P>
<P>Write me one more Letter before you come up: If it be ever &s;o &s;hort a one. Don't be proud and &s;au|cy: You imagine, I &s;uppo&s;e, that you can't write as well as Harriet and I. Granted. Attempt it not therefore. But write as well as you can; and that, till Harriet can find her&s;elf at lei&s;ure to re&s;ume her pen, &s;hall content</P>

On Sunday la&s;t, we hoped to be quiet and good: But the church was as much crouded as it was the Sunday before.</P>
<P>Monday and Tue&s;day the Bride and Bridegroom returned the vi&s;its made them. At one, they met Mi&s;s&punc; Orme, and accompanied her to their &s;eat called <HI>The Park,</HI> at her reque&s;t. You did not &s;eem to like my account of Sir Charles's interview with Mr. Orme in my la&s;t: So I will not tell you what pa&s;&s;ed on ac|ca&s;ion of this vi&s;it to that worthy man. I will be as perver&s;e as you are difficult. I <HI>don't</HI> care. Yet, as your new &s;i&s;ter de&s;cribed the meeting and parting to me, you would have been plea&s;ed with what I could have told you.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday we had a Ball given by Mrs. Shirley. Were I able to write to plea&s;e you, how I could ex|patiate on this occa&s;ion! How did the Bridegroom &s;hine! Every-body was in raptures with him, on his charming behaviour to his Bride. The notice he took of her was neither too little, nor too much, for the mo&s;t delicate ob&s;ervers. Every young Lady envied her; and how coldly did &s;ome of them look on their own humble &s;ervants! They indeed were as regard|ful of him as their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; &s;o bore the preference the better. My uncle Selby was all, and more than all, he u&s;ed to be. How happy, that he is a &s;ober man! His joy, rai&s;ed by wine, would have made him mad.</P>
<P>This day we have been all happy together. A calm, &s;erene day; at Shirley-manor! And thus is the matter &s;ettled among us&mdash;Your brother and new &s;i&s;ter; my uncle and aunt Selby; Mr. Deane, and your Lady&s;hip's humble &s;ervant; are to &s;et out early to-morrow morning for London. My brother James would &s;ain accompany us; Sir Charles kindly in|viting him: But I with&s;tood it; &s;o did my aunt; the private rea&s;on becau&s;e of Mi&s;s Jervois.</P>
<P>Sir Charles thinks to &s;tay in town till the Friday
<PB N="10" REF="11">
following; and then propo&s;es to carry his Bride and all of us, to Grandi&s;on-hall.</P>
<P>A motion was made to Sir Charles by my grand|mamma Selby; whether he would not choo&s;e to be pre&s;ented with his Lady to the King on their nuptials. Sir Charles an&s;wered, that he was ready to comply with every propo&s;al that &s;hould &s;hew his duty to his Sovereign, and the grateful &s;en&s;e he had of the honour done him by his Harriet.</P>
<P>We are to call on Lord and Lady W. at Wind|&s;or; and take them with us.</P>
<P>My cou&s;in and I are to write con&s;tantly to our two grandmamma's. My &s;i&s;ter Nancy devotes her|&s;elf to <HI>our</HI> grandmother Selby. Mi&s;s Holles's will con&s;tantly vi&s;it Mrs. Shirley. Sir Charles is to bring down his Lady twice a year, or oftner, if conveniency permit.</P>
<P>He hoped, he &s;aid, after a while, to induce his Harriet to take a trip with him to Ireland, to in&s;pect the improvements making in his e&s;tate there. He will find no difficulty, I believe, to prevail upon her to accompany him thither; nor even, were he di&s;|po&s;ed to it, to the world's end.</P>
<P>He hopes for a vi&s;it from the Italian family, &s;o de|&s;ervedly dear to him; by which he is to regulate many of his future motions.</P>
<P>His new-taken hou&s;e in Gro&s;venor-&s;quare being, as you know, nearly ready, he propo&s;es to compli|ment with it tho&s;e noble gue&s;ts, for the time of their re&s;idence in England; for he, will not, it &s;eems, be &s;o &s;oon obliged to quit his pre&s;ent London-hou&s;e, as he had thought he mu&s;t.</P>
<P>And thus, my dear Lady G. have I obeyed your commands. I know you will not be &s;atisfied with me. Had I been able to <HI>follow a &s;ubject that was made to my hand,</HI> I &s;hould have attempted the parting &s;cene between my cou&s;in and her grandmamma. Could I have borrowed your pen, I would have di&s;play'd the
<PB N="11" REF="12">
tender, yet magnanimous parent, not once, tho' tot|tering with age and infirmities, hinting that &s;he might never again &s;ee the darling of her heart. She &s;addened not hope; but encouraged it. All &s;he &s;aid, demon|&s;trated Love of her Harriet, dive&s;ted of Self, and a &s;oul above the weaker pa&s;&s;ions; and well might &s;he, &s;ince &s;he has already one foot among the &s;tars, and can look down with pity, unmixed with envy, on all tho&s;e who by their youth, are doomed to toil through the rugged road of life, in &s;earch of a happine&s;s that is not to be met with in it; and at the highe&s;t, can be compounded for, only by the ble&s;&s;ing of a contented mind. With the &s;ame pen, before I had re&s;igned it, would I have de&s;cribed the lovely grandchild embrace|ing the knees of the indulgent parent, not &s;atisfied with one, two, three ble&s;&s;ings; and, le&s;s generou&s;ly in the <HI>purport,</HI> tho' not in the <HI>intent</HI> (judging from her own pre&s;ent happine&s;s, that there is &s;till &s;ome|thing worth wi&s;hing for to be met with in this world) praying to God to pre&s;erve the over-ripened fruit &s;till on the withered tree: In which we all joined. But O how much le&s;s generou&s;ly, as I hinted, becau&s;e it was altogether for our own &s;akes!&mdash;But I know not who&s;e pen I mu&s;t have borrowed, to have done ju&s;tice to Sir Charles Grandi&s;on's behaviour on this occa|&s;ion!</P>
<P>Excu&s;e this &s;erious conclu&s;ion, my dear Lady G. My cou&s;in &s;hall not &s;ee it. May &s;he know nothing but felicity! In <HI>hers</HI> is bound up that of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on; and in <HI>his</HI> that of hundreds.

<P>LUCY (my ever honoured grandmamma) has given you the particulars of the rapturous recep|tion I met with on Saturday, from my dear Lady L. on the vi&s;it we made her in her chamber. She, as well as her Lord, welcomed and congratulated us, and her&s;elf, with <HI>&s;uch</HI> a grace!&mdash;They are a charming pair!&mdash;We all rejoiced with her, on the addition &s;he had made to two families &s;o worthy.</P>
<P>Mrs. Eleanor Grandi&s;on received us al&s;o in rap|tures.</P>
<P>How did the tenderly kind notice which Sir Charles took of the lovely little infant (It is a fine child!) delight the happy mother, and every-body!</P>
<P>Lord and Lady G. met us at Lady L's; Emily, and the Earl of G. and Lady Gertrude, with them. How affectionately did the dear girl welcome us, af|ter a few tears, which &s;he endeavoured to hide, and which we pa&s;&s;ed over as tears of joy!

<P>The Chri&s;tening was delayed till Monday; becau&s;e Sir Charles was de&s;irous it &s;hould be performed at church. He had &s;ome few difficulties to get over, before he carried his point; and this was the &s;ub|&s;tance of his rea&s;onings on the &s;ubject: People of fa&s;hion, he &s;aid, &s;hould con&s;ider them&s;elves as ex|amples to the lower orders of people. They &s;hould &s;hew a conformity to the laws of their country, both eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil, where they can do it with a good con&s;cience. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, Bapti&s;m, &s;aid
<PB N="13" REF="14">
he, is one of our two &s;acraments; and &s;hall it not be performed, when it can, as the church directs; the child in full health?</P>
<P>I will give you, my dear grandmamma, journal|wi&s;e, I think, an account of our proceedings; &s;till referring my&s;elf to my Lucy for &s;uch particulars as now I &s;hall not have time to give. For you know, my dear grandmamma, that my time is not now my own, as it u&s;ed to be; tho' I &s;hall think my&s;elf very ungrate|ful, and undutiful too, if I permit my new duties &s;o wholly to engro&s;s me, as to furni&s;h an excu&s;e for the neglect of tho&s;e which from my very birth I owe to you.</P>
<P>I think Lucy has not mentioned to you the lively conver&s;ations that pa&s;&s;ed in the evening, after the chri&s;tening, between Sir Charles and Lady G. &s;he choo&s;ing to &s;ingle out her brother (as &s;he had threat|ned, unknown to him, to do) in order to try once more her &s;trength with him, in vivacity and raillery. She delighted every-body with her wit: For it was not &s;o rapid and &s;o unguarded as &s;ometimes it is. He <HI>conde&s;cended,</HI> was Lucy's ju&s;t ob&s;ervation, to re|turn wit for her wit, in order to follow her lead, as he &s;aw the company was delighted with their conver|&s;ation; and was exceedingly brilliant. She compli|mented her&s;elf on the merit of having drawn him out, tho' to her own di&s;advantage. Finding her&s;elf over|matched, &s;he &s;hifted her attacks, and made one up|on me; but with &s;o much decorum and complai&s;ance, as &s;hewed &s;he <HI>intended</HI> to do me honour, rather than her&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day evening.</HI>] Sir Charles is ju&s;t returned from vi&s;iting Sir Harry Beauchamp. The poor man num|bers his hours, and owned, that the <HI>three</HI> the be&s;t of men gave him, as by his own watch (tho' Sir Charles intended to be back in one) were more happy ones than he had promi&s;ed him&s;elf in this life. O madam! How ea&s;y &s;its my Sir Charles's piety upon
<PB N="14" REF="15">
him! He can pity a dying friend, without &s;addening his own heart; for he lives the life of duty as he goes along, and fears not the inevitable lot!</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day.</HI>] He is ju&s;t returned from a vi&s;it to Sir Hargrave. Sir Hargrave, it &s;eems, compliment|ed him, but with tears in his eyes, on his marriage. Great God! &s;aid he, how are you rewarded! How am I puni&s;hed! Is there not hope that I have all my puni&s;hment in this life? I am &s;ure, it is very, <HI>very</HI> heavy.</P>
<P>He vi&s;ited the &s;ame day Mrs. Oldham, and her children.</P>
<P>He drank tea this afternoon with the Danby family in full a&s;&s;embly, at the hou&s;e of the elder brother; and came to my cou&s;in Reeves's to &s;upper. My uncle, aunt, Mr. Deane, and Lucy, accompanied me thither to tea and &s;upper, where, as by promi&s;e, we were joined by Lord and Lady G. Lord L. Mrs. Eleanor Grandi&s;on, my Emily, and Mr. Beauchamp. Mr. Reeves had al&s;o invited Lady Betty Williams. What felicitations did &s;he pour on me! She &s;ighed, poor Lady! for the unhappy &s;tep her daughter had taken: And I &s;ighed for the mother; who, tho' &s;he had not given her daughter a <HI>bad</HI> example, had not &s;et her a <HI>good</HI> one.</P>
<P>Lucy will tell you what a charming evening we had.</P>
<P>On <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI>] Mr. Grandi&s;on pre&s;ented his new|married Lady to Sir Charles and me, on account of our marriage, and dined with us. Sir Charles received the Lady, as well as his cou&s;in, with the utmo&s;t polite|ne&s;s. She is far from being a di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">greeable woman: But, at fir&s;t, the awe &s;he had of the people of rank in company, particularly of Lady G. as &s;he owned to me, gave her an air of aukwardne&s;s. But Sir Charles's polite notice of her &s;oon made her ea&s;y.</P>
<P>Mr. Grandi&s;on found an opportunity to prai&s;e to me her good &s;en&s;e and fine qualities; but in &s;uch a way, as if he were making apologies for having given
<PB N="15" REF="16">
the <HI>honour</HI> of his name to a woman under his own rank (ungrateful!) who yet had re-e&s;tabli&s;hed him: He concluded his panegyric with letting me know, that &s;he had already pre&s;ented him with 25,000 pounds: He looked as if he thought he de&s;erved it all: and actually called her a very di&s;cerning woman. I que&s;tion|ed not, I told him, his gratitude to a Lady &s;o de&s;erv|ing; and he as good as promi&s;ed to <HI>reward</HI> her by his Love; whi&s;pering, with an air of &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, &s;ticking his hand in his &s;ide, and &s;urveying him&s;elf to the right and left, Her former Hu&s;band, madam, was a very plain, but an hone&s;t man. But I do a&s;&s;ure you &s;he has ta&s;te!&mdash;O dear! O dear! thought I to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Sir Charles invited them both to Grandi&s;on-hall, and &s;he &s;eemed not a little proud on his calling her, as he did &s;everal times, <HI>Cou&s;in.</HI></P>
<P>Lord L. and Lord and Lady G. dined with us, as did Mrs. Eleanor Grandi&s;on and Emily. Lady G. in the main, behaved prettily enough to Mr. Grandi&s;on and his Bride. But once a little forgetting her&s;elf, and putting on a &s;upercilious air, I whi&s;pered her, Dear Lady G. con&s;ider, you can <HI>give</HI> pride to others by your conde&s;cen&s;ion: You mu&s;t not your&s;elf <HI>conde&s;cend</HI> to be proud.</P>
<P>Be you, my Harriet, re-whi&s;pered &s;he, always my monitre&s;s. It is the &s;orry fellow, not his wife, that <HI>I look down upon,</HI> She, a widow <HI>Cit,</HI> might have done &s;till wor&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Cit!</HI> Lady G. And in a trading kingdom?</P>
<P>Ay, Cit, child! Have you not heard my brother &s;ay, that even in the <HI>republic</HI> of Venice, there are young nobility and old nobility: Di&s;tinctions in blood every-where but at Am&s;terdam!</P>
<P>Who, and what, at fir&s;t, made the di&s;tinction, my dear? a&s;ked I.</P>
<P>Be quiet, Harriet!&mdash;I think I am very good&mdash;</P>
<P>And at the <HI>height</HI> of your goodne&s;s, Charlotte?</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="17">
Be quiet, when I bid you? aloud.</P>
<P>Sir Charles a little jealous of our whi&s;pering, for the &s;ake of his cou&s;ins, turning to Mr. Grandi&s;on, Your cou&s;in Charlotte, you know, Sir, is always hard pre&s;&s;ed, when &s;he calls out, <HI>Be quiet.</HI></P>
<P>I was always rejoiced, replied he, when my cou&s;in was brought to that.</P>
<P>Sir Charles has been twice at the Drawing-room, &s;ince we have been in town. He admires the integrity of heart of his Sovereign, as much as he reveres his royal dignity. Once I remember, he wi&s;hed that his Maje&s;ty would take a &s;ummer's progre&s;s thro' his Briti&s;h, another into his Iri&s;h, dominions; but ex|pre&s;ly with this provi&s;o, That every gentleman and woman of condition &s;hould be welcome at his court, who came not in new dre&s;&s;es to pay their duty to him; and this le&s;t the gentry's vying with each other in ap|pearance, &s;hould hurt their private circum&s;tances; and for the &s;ame rea&s;on, that he would graciou&s;ly treat, but not be treated by, any of the nobility at their hou&s;es.</P>
<P>To-morrow morning, Sir Charles, his grateful Har|riet, happy creature! my uncle and aunt Selby, Mr. Deane, and Emily, are to &s;et out by the way of Wind|&s;or for Grandi&s;on-hall. We are to take an early dinner there with Lord and Lady W.; who, on that condi|tion, have promi&s;ed to attend their beloved nephew, and his friends, to the Hall.</P>
<P>Lord G. is allowed to &s;tay a week with us, and no more. He is then to attend his now but half|&s;aucy Lady, at one of the Earl of G's &s;eats in Hert|ford&s;hire; where, by promi&s;e of long-&s;tanding, &s;he is to keep her Chri&s;tmas: At which &s;he mutters not a little; becau&s;e &s;he would &s;ain have been with us; and becau&s;e &s;he imagines, it will be proper for her to confine her&s;elf at home, by the time they will part with her.</P>
<P>My aunt Selby, and even my uncle, will write.

<P>O My deare&s;t, deare&s;t grandmamma! Here I am! The declared mi&s;tre&s;s of this &s;pacious hou&s;e, and the happie&s;t of human creatures! This is all at this in|&s;tant I can write.</P>
<P>LORD and Lady W. honoured us, as they had pro|mi&s;ed, with their company; but detained us &s;o long, that we were obliged to he one night on the road. But by eleven this morning we arrived here.</P>
<P>At our alighting, Sir Charles cla&s;ping me in his arms, I congratulate you, my deare&s;t life, &s;aid he, on your entrance into <HI>your own</HI> hou&s;e. The la&s;t Lady Grandi&s;on, and the pre&s;ent, might challenge the whole Briti&s;h nation to produce their equals. Then turning to every one of his gue&s;ts, tho&s;e of my family fir&s;t, as they were &s;trangers to the place,

he &s;aid the kinde&s;t, the polite&s;t things that ever pro|ceeded from the mouth of man. I wept for joy. I would have &s;poken, but could not. Every-body con|gratulated the happy Harriet.</P>
<P>Dr. Bartlett was approaching to welcome us, but drew back till our mutual congratulations were over. He then appeared. I pre&s;ent to you, my dear Dr. Bartlett, &s;aid the be&s;t of men, the lovely friend, whom you have &s;o long wi&s;hed to &s;ee mi&s;tre&s;s of this hou&s;e. He then offered my hand to the Doctor.</P>
<P>God ble&s;s you, madam! tears in his eyes.&mdash;God ble&s;s you both! Then ki&s;&s;ed, in&s;tead of myhand, which I withdrew, my offered cheek. He could &s;ay no more: I could not &s;peak di&s;tinctly.</P>
<P>My dear Sir Charles led me, followed by all our rejoicing friends, thro' a noble dining-room to the drawing-room, called, The Lady's: The whole hou&s;e, my dear, &s;aid he, and every per&s;on and thing belong|ing to it, is yours: But this apartment is more parti|cularly &s;o. Let what is ami&s;s in it, be altered as you would have it.</P>
<P>O Sir! gra&s;ping his pre&s;enting hand between both mine, was all I could &s;ay.</P>
<P>This room is elegantly furni&s;hed. It is hung with a light green velvet, delicately ornamented; the chairs of the &s;ame; the frames of them gilt; as is the frame of a noble cabinet in it.&mdash;My mother's, my deare&s;t life, whi&s;pered he. It will be always fa&s;hionable: And you, I know, will value it on her account.&mdash;Indeed I &s;hall.&mdash;He pre&s;ented me with the keys. Here perhaps will you depo&s;it your letters and corre&s;pondences; &s;ome of which (the continuation of tho&s;e I have had the honour to &s;ee) you will allow me to peru&s;e. But of <HI>choice,</HI> remember, madam. For your whole heart mu&s;t be in the grant of the favours you will confer upon me of this kind.</P>
<P>Dear Sir, &s;aid I, leave me power of &s;peech; my will &s;hall be yours, in every-thing. But you will
<PB N="19" REF="20">
find a &s;trange, &s;trange heart, laid open to you, if you command from me a &s;ight of the papers, that proba|bly will be repo&s;ited here, when all my matters are brought from Northampton&s;hire.</P>
<P>You &s;hall have all the Letters you ever wrote to me, and the venerable circle, &s;aid Lucy; a loan, not a gift; if you will &s;hew them to Sir Charles.</P>
<P>Courage, Lucy, not inclination, will be only want|ing.</P>
<P>Thank you, Lucy, &s;aid he. Thank you, my Love, to me. You mu&s;t make marks again&s;t the pa&s;&s;ages in the Letters you &s;hall have the goodne&s;s to communicate, which you would not have me read. I will give you my honour that I will not pa&s;s the bounds you pre&s;cribe.</P>
<P>I will &s;natch another opportunity to proceed.&mdash;My dear Sir Charles indulges me. I have told him, that if he now-and-then mi&s;&s;es, he mu&s;t conclude that I am doubling my joy, by communicating it as I have opportunity, to my dear Grandmamma.</P>
<P>EVERY-BODY admires the elegance of this draw|ing-room. The fine&s;t japan china, that I ever &s;aw, except that of Lady G's, which &s;he &s;o whim&s;ically received at the hands of her Lord, took particularly every female eye.</P>
<P>Sir Charles led me into a clo&s;et adjoining&mdash;Your Oratory, your Library, my Love, when you &s;hall have furni&s;hed it, as you de&s;ired you might, by your cho&s;en collection from Northampton&s;hire.</P>
<P>It is a &s;weet little apartment, my dear grandmamma; elegant book-ca&s;es, unfurni&s;hed. Every other orna|ment complete. How had he been at work to oblige me, by Dr. Bartlett's good offices, while my heart per|haps was torn, part of the time, with uncertainty!</P>
<P>The hou&s;e-keeper, a middle-aged woman, who is noted, as you have heard her ma&s;ter &s;ay, for prudence, integrity, and obligingne&s;s, a gentlewoman (born)
<PB N="20" REF="21">
appearing; Sir Charles pre&s;ented her to me. Re|ceive, my Love, a faithful, a di&s;creet gentlewoman, who will think her&s;elf honoured with your com|mands. Mrs. Curzon (to her) you will be happy in a mi&s;tre&s;s who is equally beloved and reverenced by all who have the honour of her countenance, if &s;he approve of your &s;ervices, and if you choo&s;e to conti|nue with us.</P>
<P>I took her hand: I hope Mrs. Curzon, there is no doubt but you will. You may depend upon every-thing that is in my power to make you ea&s;y and happy.</P>
<P>She looked plea&s;ed; but an&s;wered only with a re|&s;pectful courte&s;y.</P>
<P>Sir Charles led the gentleman out to &s;hew them his Study. We ju&s;t looked into a fine &s;uite of rooms on the &s;ame floor, and joined them there.</P>
<P>We found my uncle and Mr. Deane admiring the di&s;po&s;ition of every-thing, as well as the furniture. The gla&s;s-ca&s;es are neat, and, as Dr. Bartlett told us, &s;tored with well-cho&s;en books in all &s;ciences. Mr. Deane prai&s;ed the globes, the orrery, and the in&s;tru|ments of all &s;orts, for geographical, a&s;tronomical, and other &s;cientifical ob&s;ervations. It is ornamented with pictures, &s;ome, as Dr. Bartlett told us, of the be&s;t ma&s;ters of the Italian and Flemi&s;h &s;chools, &s;tatues, bu&s;toes, bronzes: And there al&s;o, placed in a di&s;tin|gui&s;hed manner, were the two rich cabinets of me|dals, gems, and other curio&s;ities, pre&s;ented to him by Lady Olivia. He mentioned what they contain|ed, and by whom pre&s;ented; and &s;aid, he would &s;hew us at lei&s;ure the contents. They are not mine, added he: I only give them a place till the generous owner &s;hall make &s;ome worthy man happy. <HI>His</HI> they mu&s;t be. It would be a kind of robbery to take them from a family, that, for near a century pa&s;t, have been collecting them.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="22">
LUCY &s;ays, &s;he will be very particular in her Let|ters. This will take up time; e&s;pecially as Lady G. and Lady L. mu&s;t &s;ee them in their way to Nor|thampton&s;hire; tho' they will not detain them. I &s;hall have an opportunity to &s;end this to London on Mon|day. This makes me intent to &s;natch every oppor|tunity of writing. It will otherwi&s;e be too long be|fore you will hear from us by my hand.</P>
<P>I do not intend to invade this &s;low girl's province; yet I will give you a &s;light &s;ketch of the hou&s;e and apartments, as I go along.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation is delightful. The hou&s;e is very &s;pa|cious. It is built in the form of an H; both fronts pretty much alike. The hall, the dining-parlour, two drawing-rooms, one adjoining to the &s;tudy, the other to the dining-parlour (which with the &s;tudy, mentioned already, and other rooms, that I &s;hall leave to Lucy to de&s;cribe, make the ground-floor) are hand&s;ome, and furni&s;hed in an elegant, but not &s;umptuous ta&s;te; the hangings of &s;ome them beauti|ful paper only. There is adjoining to the &s;tudy, a room called <HI>The Mu&s;ic-parlour,</HI> &s;o called in Sir Tho|mas's time, and furni&s;hed with &s;everal fine mu&s;ical in&s;truments: Sir Thomas was as great an admirer of mu&s;ic as his &s;on; and a performer.</P>
<P>It is no news to you, madam, that Sir Charles &s;hews a great regard to every thing, place, and di&s;po|&s;ition, that was his father's; and not ab&s;olutely incon|venient, and incon&s;i&s;tent with the alterations he has thought nece&s;&s;ary to make: And which Dr. Bartlett prai&s;es highly, and promi&s;es to particularize to me. We are to be &s;hewn this Mu&s;ic-parlour by-and-by.</P>
<P>The dining-room is noble and well proportioned: It goes over the hall and dining-parlour. It is hung with crim&s;on-dama&s;k, adorned with valuable pictures. The furniture is rich, but le&s;s ornamented than that of the Lady's drawing-room.</P>
<P>The be&s;t bed chamber adjoining, is hung with
<PB N="22" REF="23">
fine tape&s;try. The bed is of crim&s;on velvet, lined with white &s;ilk; chairs and curtains of the &s;ame. Two fine pictures drawn by Sir Godfrey, one of Sir Tho|mas, the other of Lady Grand&s;on, whole lengths, took my eye: O with what reverence, that of my Lady!&mdash;Lady L. Lady G. as girls, and Sir Charles as a boy of about ten years of age, made three other fine whole lengths. I mu&s;t contemplate them, when I have more lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>The &s;uit of rooms on the fir&s;t floor which we ju&s;t &s;tept into, are each denominated from the colour of the hangings, which are generally of dama&s;k.</P>
<P>Mrs. Curzon tells us, that, on occa&s;ion, they make fifteen beds, within the hou&s;e, in which the be&s;t Lord in the land need not di&s;dain to repo&s;e.&mdash;You re|member, madam, that Sir Charles, in his invitation to the Italian family, tells them, he has room to receive them. The offices are &s;aid to be exceedingly con|venient.</P>
<P>The gardens and lawn &s;eem from the windows of this &s;pacious hou&s;e to be as boundle&s;s as the mind of the owner, and as free and open as his counte|nance.</P>
<P>[MISS Lucy Selby thus de&s;cribes the &s;ituation of the hou&s;e, and the park, gardens, orchard, &amp;c. in one of her Letters which does not appear.]</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"THIS large and convenient hou&s;e is &s;ituated in a &s;pacious park; which has &s;everal fine avenues lead|ing to it.</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The park it&s;elf is remarkable for its pro&s;pects,

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"On the &s;outh &s;ide of the river, on a natural and ea&s;y a&s;cent, is a neat, but plain villa, in the ru&s;tic ta&s;te, erected by Sir Thomas; the flat roof of which pre&s;ents a noble pro&s;pect.

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The orchard, which takes up near three acres of ground, is planted in a peculiar ta&s;te.

This was his &s;peech to her, unable to check his emotion; What a man is this, dame Selby! We were &s;urely wanting in re&s;pect to him when he was among us. To &s;end &s;uch a one to an inn!&mdash;Fie upon us!&mdash;Lord be good unto me! how are things come about!&mdash;Who would have thought it?&mdash;Some|times I wonder the girl is not as proud as Lucifer; at other times, that &s;he is able to look him in the face!</P>
<P>To this convenient hou&s;e belongs an elegant little chapel, neatly decorated. But Sir Charles, when down, generally goes to the pari&s;h-church, of which he is patron.</P>
<P>The gallery I have not yet &s;een&mdash;Dr. Bartlett tells me, it is adorned with a long line of ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>AFTER dinner, which was &s;umptuous and well|ordered, Sir Charles led us into the Mu&s;ic-parlour. O, madam, you &s;hall hear what honour was done me there.&mdash;I will lead to it.</P>
<P>Several of the neighbouring gentlemen, he told us, are performers; and he hopes to engage them as op|portunities

&s;hall offer. My dear Dr. Bartlett, &s;aid he, your &s;oal is harmony: I doubt not but all the&s;e are in order&mdash;"May I a&s;k you, my Harriet?" point|ing to the harp&s;ichord. I in&s;tantly &s;at down to it. It is a fine In&s;trument. Lord G. took up a violin; Lord L. a German flute; Mr. Deane a ba&s;s-viol; and we had a little concert of about half an hour.</P>
<P>Here is a noble organ: When the little concert was over, he was &s;o good him&s;elf, on my aunt's referring to him with a&s;king eyes, to &s;hew us it was in tune.</P>
<P>We all &s;eated our&s;elves round him, on his prepare|ing to oblige us; I between my aunt and Lucy; and he with a voice admirably &s;uited to the in&s;trument (but the words, if I may be allowed to &s;ay &s;o, &s;till <HI>more</HI> admirably to the occa&s;ion) at once delighted and &s;urprized us all, by the following Lines:</P>

<P>How did our friends look upon one another, as the excellent man proceeded!&mdash;I was a&s;toni&s;hed. It was happy I &s;at between my aunt and Lucy!&mdash;They each took one of my hands. Tears of joy ran down my cheeks. Every one's eyes congratulated me.

<P>He approached me with tender mode&s;ty; as if aba&s;hed by the applau&s;e he met with. But &s;eeing me affected, he was concerned. I withdrew with my aunt and Lucy. He followed me.

<P>THE Mu&s;ic-parlour [I can hardly mention it with|out breaking into raptures] is adorned with a variety of fine carvings, on &s;ubjects that do honour to poetry and mu&s;ic. Be it Lucy's ta&s;k to de&s;cribe them. Let me mention other in&s;tances of his tender goodne&s;s to one of the happie&s;t creatures on earth.</P>
<P>You know, madam, Sir Charles, when in Nor|thampton&s;hire, offered me my choice of &s;ervants of both &s;exes; and when I told him, that I cho&s;e not to take with me any one of either but my Sally, he &s;aid, that when I came to Grandi&s;on-hall, where they would be all together, I &s;hould choo&s;e which of the men-&s;ervants I would more particularly call my own. He gave me ju&s;t now the names and qualities of each. Frederic I had &s;een at Selby-hou&s;e, an ob&s;ervant, &s;en&s;ible-looking young man (but are not all his &s;er|vants
<PB N="27" REF="28">
&s;o?): I choo&s;e <HI>him.</HI> He called him in (my aunt Selby pre&s;ent): All my &s;ervants, Frederic, &s;aid he, are as much your Lady's as mine: But <HI>you</HI> will de|vote your&s;elf <HI>more particularly</HI> to her commands. I mean not, however, any di&s;tinction in your favour, where you all equally merit di&s;tinction. The power, madam, of change or di&s;mi&s;&s;ion thro' the hou&s;e is entirely yours.</P>
<P>To-morrow, I am to go over all the bridal o&s;ten|tation again at the pari&s;h-church. On Monday Lady Mansfield and her family are to be here.&mdash;<HI>Your</HI> gue&s;ts, my dear, &s;aid Sir Charles, to me, before all our friends, I hope, for a week at lea&s;t. This was the fir&s;t notice he gave of it to Lord and Lady W. What joy and gratitude appeared in her countenance upon it.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day, by general approbation (Sir Charles &s;ub|mitting the choice of the day to his gue&s;ts) we are to have the neighbouring gentry here to dinner, and for the re&s;t of the day. Sir Charles has been long wi&s;hed by them all to re&s;ide among them. He breaks thro' the u&s;ual forms, and cho&s;e this way, at once, to receive the vi&s;its of all his neighbours, and in both our names gave the invitation. He &s;newed us a li&s;t of the per&s;ons invited. It is a very large one. My deare&s;t life, &s;aid he, we &s;hall be all half-familiarized to them, they to us, even to-morrow, by the free|dom of this invitation for the Tue&s;day following.</P>
<P>Mrs. Curzon came to me for directions about the bedchambers. I took that opportunity to tell her, that I &s;hould add to the number of female &s;ervants, only my Sally, of who&s;e di&s;cretion I had no doubt. You mu&s;t introduce to me, &s;aid I, at a proper time, the female &s;ervants. If you, Mrs. Curzon, approve of them, I &s;hall make no changes. I am, my&s;elf, the happie&s;t of women: Every one who de&s;erves it, &s;hall find her happine&s;s in mine.</P>
<P>You will rejoice all their hearts, madam, by this
<PB N="28" REF="29">
early declaration of your good to them. I can truly &s;ay, that the be&s;t of ma&s;ters has not the wor&s;t of &s;ervants: But Dr. Bartlett would make bad &s;ervants good.</P>
<P>I &s;hall want no other proof, &s;aid I, of their good|ne&s;s, than their love and re&s;pect to Dr. Bartlett.</P>
<P>In company of my aunt, Lady W. Lucy, Mi&s;s Jer|vois, attended by Mrs. Curzon, we went to choo&s;e our rooms; and tho&s;e for our expected gue&s;ts of Monday. We &s;oon fixed on them. My aunt with her u&s;ual good|ne&s;s, and Lady W. with that conde&s;cen&s;ion that is na|tural to her, took great notice of Mrs. Curzon, who &s;eem|ed delighted with us all; and &s;aid, that &s;he &s;hould be the happier in the performance of her duty, as &s;he had been informed, we were managing Ladies. It was a plea&s;ure, &s;he &s;aid, to receive commands from per&s;ons who knew when things were properly done. You, my deare&s;t grandmamma, from my earlie&s;t youth, have told me, that to be re&s;pected even by &s;ervants, it is nece&s;&s;ary to be able to direct them, and not be thought ignorant in tho&s;e matters that it becomes a mi&s;tre&s;s of a family to be acquainted with. They &s;hall not find me pragmatical, however, in the little knowledge I have in family-matters.</P>
<P>Will nothing happen, my dear grandmamma&mdash;But no more of this kind&mdash;Shall I by my diffidences le&s;&s;en the enjoyments of which I am in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion? My joy may not be &s;ufficient to bani&s;h fear; but I hope it will be a prudent one, which will &s;erve to in|crea&s;e my thankfulne&s;s to heaven, and my gratitude to the man &s;o ju&s;tly dear to me.</P>
<P>But do you, my grandmamma, whenever you pray for the continuance of your Harriet's happine&s;s, pray al&s;o for that of Lady Clementina: That only can be wanting in my pre&s;ent &s;ituation, to complete the felicity of</P>

<P>WHAT a crouded church-yard and church had I to pa&s;s thro' to the hand&s;ome &s;eat, which be|longs to the excellent patron of it!&mdash;How much ex|alted was I to hear his whi&s;pered prai&s;es! How did my Northampton&s;hire friends rejoice in the re&s;pectful approbation paid to the happy creature, to whom they are more immediately related! I am always a little mortified by prai&s;es of my figure. What a tran&s;itory thing is outward form!&mdash;May I make to my&s;elf a more &s;olid and permanent foundation for that re&s;pect, which is generally more plea&s;ing to a female heart than it ought to be.</P>
<P>Sir Charles was not unhappy in his invitation for next Tue&s;day. It took off, I imagine, &s;ome parti|cular addre&s;&s;es to him. Yet &s;everal gentlemen at his coach-&s;ide acknowledged the favour done them in it.</P>
<P>My uncle, who, you know, madam, loves every-thing that promotes good neighbourhood, is greatly delighted with the thoughts of the day. How proud is he of his Harriet! How much more proud of his relation to the be&s;t of men!</P>
<P>I have looked upon what Lucy has written. I &s;ee there will be but little room for me to &s;ay any-thing. She is delighted with the ta&s;k. It employs all her fa|culties; di&s;plays her fine ta&s;te in architecture, paint|ings, needle-works, &s;hell-works. She will give you a de&s;cription of &s;everal charming performances in the two latter arts, of the late Lady Grandi&s;on!&mdash;How does the character of that admirable Lady ri&s;e upon us! With what emulation does it fire me! On twenty accounts, it was a very bold thing, my grand|mamma, for your Harriet to a&s;pire to be Lady Gran|di&s;on!&mdash;Yet how does Sir Charles's goodne&s;s, his
<PB N="30" REF="31">
kind acceptance of all my humble endeavours, en|courage me!&mdash;O, madam! he &s;aid truth, when in court|&s;hip he told me, that I parted with power to have it returned me with augmentation. I don't know how it is, but his freedom of behaviour to me is increa&s;ed; yet his re&s;pectfulne&s;s is not dimini&s;hed.&mdash;And, tender as he was before to me, his tenderne&s;s is &s;till greater than it was: Yet &s;o much unaffected dignity in it, that my reverence for him is augmented, but with|out any abatement of my Love. Then his chearful|ne&s;s, his <HI>more</HI> than chearfulne&s;s, his vivacity, &s;hews, that he is at heart plea&s;ed with his Harriet. Happy Harriet!&mdash;Yet I cannot forbear now-and-then, when my joy and my gratitude are at the highe&s;t, a &s;igh to the merits of Lady Clementina!&mdash;What I am now, &s;hould &s;he have been, think I often!&mdash;The ge|neral admination paid me as the wife of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, &s;hould have been paid to her!&mdash;Lady L. Lady G. &s;hould have been, her &s;i&s;ters! She &s;hould have been the mi&s;tre&s;s of this hou&s;e, the co-guardian of Emily, the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of the late excellent Lady Grandi&s;on!&mdash;Haple&s;s Clementina!&mdash;What a &s;trange thing, that a love of religion in two per&s;ons &s;o pious, &s;o good, each in their way, &s;hould &s;under, for ever &s;under, per&s;ons who&s;e minds were &s;o clo&s;ely united!</P>
<P>Sir Charles, by Lucy, invites me, till dinner is ready, to walk with them, at her reque&s;t, in the gal|lery. Lucy wants, in de&s;cribing that gallery, to give you, my deare&s;t grandmamma (in whom every other of my friends is included) a brief hi&s;tory of the an|ce&s;tors of Sir Charles, who&s;e pictures adorn it. I come! Lord of my heart! I attend you!&mdash;</P>
<P>How, madam, would you have been delighted, could you have &s;at in this truly noble gallery, and &s;een the dear man, one arm round my wai&s;t, holding my oppo&s;ite hand in the hand of the &s;ame &s;urrounding arm, pointing &s;ometimes with the other, &s;ometimes
<PB N="31" REF="32">
putting that other arm round my Lucy's, and giving &s;hort hi&s;tories of the per&s;ons who&s;e pictures we &s;aw!</P>
<P>Some of the pictures are really fine. One of Sir Charles's, which is drawn when he was about &s;ix|teen, is on hor&s;eback. The hor&s;e a managed, cur|vetting, proud bea&s;t.&mdash;His &s;eat, &s;pirit, courage, ad|mirably expre&s;&s;ed: He mu&s;t have been, as his &s;i&s;ters &s;ay he was, the lovelie&s;t, and the mo&s;t undaunted, yet mo&s;t mode&s;t-looking, of youths. He pa&s;&s;ed his own picture &s;o &s;lightly, that I had not time to take in half the beauties of it. You will not doubt, ma|dam, but I &s;hall be often in this gallery, were only this one picture there.</P>
<P>What plea&s;ure had I in hearing the hi&s;tory of this antient family, from this unbroken &s;eries of the pictures of it, for &s;o many generations pa&s;t! And will mine, one day, thought I, be allowed a place among them, near to that of the mo&s;t amiable of them all, both as to mind and figure? How my heart exulted! What were my meditations as I traced the imagined foot&s;teps of dear Lady Grandi&s;on, her picture and Sir Thomas's in my eye! as finely executed, as tho&s;e in the be&s;t bedchamber. May I, thought I, with a happier lot, be but half as de&s;erving! But, madam, did not Lady Grandi&s;on &s;hine the more for the hard|&s;hips &s;he pa&s;&s;ed through?&mdash;And is it nece&s;&s;ary for virtue to be called forth by trials, in order to be ju&s;ti|fied by its fortitude under them? What trials can I be called to with Sir Charles Grandi&s;on? But may I not take my place on the foot&s;tep of her throne, yet make no contemptible figure in the family of her be|loved &s;on? I will humbly endeavour to de&s;erve my good fortune, and leave the re&s;t to Providence.</P>
<P>There are in different apartments of this &s;eat, be&s;ides two in the hou&s;e in the town, no le&s;s than &s;ix pictures of Sir Thomas: But then two of them were brought from his &s;eat in E&s;&s;ex. Sir Thomas was fond of his per&s;on: They are drawn in different attitudes.
<PB N="32" REF="33">
He appears to be, as I have always heard he was, a fine figure of a man. But neither Lucy nor I, tho' we made not the compliment to Sir Charles, you may &s;uppo&s;e (who always &s;peaks with reverence and unaffected Love of his father) thought him compara|ble in figure, dignity, intelligence, to his &s;on.</P>
<P>We were called to dinner, before we had gone half-way thro' the gallery.</P>
<P>We had a crouded church again in the afternoon.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday night.</HI>] This excellent Dr. Bartlett! And, this excellent Sir Charles Grandi&s;on! I may &s;ay.&mdash;Sir Charles having enquired of the Doctor, when alone with him, after the rules ob&s;erved by him be|fore we came down, the Doctor told him, that he had every morning and night the few &s;ervants attend|ing him in his antechamber to prayers, which he had &s;elected out of the Church Service. Sir Charles de&s;ired him by all means to continue &s;o laudable a cu&s;tom; for he was &s;ure ma&s;ter and &s;ervants would both find their account in it.</P>
<P>Sir Charles &s;ent for Richard Saunders and Mrs. Curzon. He applauded to them the Doctor's good|ne&s;s, and de&s;ired they would &s;ignify, the one to the men-&s;ervants, the other to the women, that he &s;hould take it well of them, if they chearfully at|tended the Doctor; promi&s;ing to give them opportu|nity, as often as was po&s;&s;ible. Half an hour after ten, Doctor, I believe is a good time in the evening?</P>
<P>That, Sir, is about my time, and eight in the morning, as an hour the lea&s;t likely to interfere with their bu&s;ine&s;s. Whenever it does, they are in their duty, and I do not then expect them.</P>
<P>About a quarter after ten, the Doctor &s;lipt away. Soon after Sir Charles withdrew, unperceived by any of us. The Doctor and his little church were a&s;&s;em|bled. Sir Charles joined them, and afterwards re|turned to company, with that chearfulne&s;s that always
<PB N="33" REF="34">
beams in his a&s;pect. The Doctor followed him, with a countenance as &s;erene. I took the Doctor a&s;ide, tho' in the &s;ame apartment, &s;uppo&s;ing the matter. Sir Charles joining us&mdash;O Sir, &s;aid I, why was I not whi&s;pered to withdraw with you? Think you, that your Harriet&mdash;</P>
<P>The company, my deare&s;t Love, interrupted he, was not now to be broken up. When we are &s;ettled, we can make a cu&s;tom for our&s;elves, that will be allowed for by every-body, when it is &s;een we per|&s;evere, and are in every other re&s;pect, unform: Jo&s;hua's re&s;olution, Doctor, was an excellent one <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">As for me and my hou&s;e, we will &s;erve the Lord, Jo&s;h. xxiv. 15.</NOTE>. The chapel, now our congregation is large, will be the propere&s;t place; and there, perhaps, the friends we may happen to have&punc; with us, will &s;ometimes join us.</P>
<P><HI>Monday morning.</HI>] Sir Charles has ju&s;t now pre|&s;ented to me, in Doctor Bartlett's pre&s;ence, Mr. Da|niel Bartlett, the Doctor's nephew, and his only care in this world; a young gentleman of about eighteen, well educated, and a fine accomptant, a ma&s;ter of his pen, and particularly of the art of &s;hort-hand writing. The Doctor in&s;i&s;ted on the &s;pecification of a &s;alary, which he named him&s;elf to be 40<HI>l.</HI> a year, and to be within the hou&s;e, that he might always be at hand. He could not tru&s;t, he &s;aid, to his patron's a&s;&s;urances, that his bountiful &s;pirit would allow him to have a re|gard, in the reward, only to the merit of the &s;ervice.</P>
<P><HI>Monday noon.</HI>] Lady Mansfield, Mi&s;s Mansfield, and the three Brothers, are arrived. What excellent women, what agreeable young gentlemen, what grateful hearts, what joy to Lady W. on their arrival, what plea&s;ure to Lord W. who, on every occa&s;ion, &s;hews his delight in his nephew!&mdash;All the&s;e things, with their compliments to your happy Harriet, let Lucy tell. I have not time.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="35">
WHAT, my dear grandmamma, &s;hall we do with Lord and Lady W.?&mdash;Such a rich &s;ervice of gilt plate! Ju&s;t arrived! A pre&s;ent to me!&mdash;It is a noble pre|&s;ent!&mdash;And &s;o gracefully pre&s;ented! And I &s;o grace|fully permitted to accept of it, by my be&s;t, my ten|dere&s;t friend!&mdash;Let Lucy de&s;cribe this too.</P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day morning</HI>] A va&s;t company we &s;hall have. Gentlemen and their Ladies are invited: Your Har|riet is to be dre&s;&s;ed: She is already dre&s;&s;ed. How kindly am I complimented, by every one of my friends!&mdash;Let Lucy, let my aunt (&s;he promi&s;es to a&s;&s;i&s;t Lucy) relate all that &s;hall pa&s;s, de&s;cribe the per|&s;ons, and give the characters of our vi&s;iters; our managements, our entertainments, the Ball, that is to conclude the day and night. I &s;hall not be able, I &s;uppo&s;e, to write a line.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day noon.</HI>] Our company left us not till &s;ix this morning. My uncle was tran&s;ported with the day; with the night.</P>
<P>I will only &s;ay, that all was happy; and decency, good order, mirth, and jollity, went thro' the whole &s;pace. Sir Charles was every-where, and with every-body. He was almo&s;t as much every Lady's as mine. O how he charmed them all! Sir William Turner &s;aid once, behind his back, Of what tran&s;ports did my late friend Sir Thomas&punc; who doted upon his &s;on, deprive him&s;elf by keeping him &s;o long abroad!</P>
<P>I could not but think of what my dear Lady G. once wrote, that women are not &s;o &s;oon tired as men, with the&s;e diver&s;ions, with dancing particularly. By three, all but Sir Charles and my uncle &s;eemed quite fa|tigued: But recovered them&s;elves. My Emily de|lighted every-body. She was the whole night what I wi&s;hed her to be&mdash;Dear madam, be not unea&s;y. We &s;hall be very happy in each other.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="36">
O that you were with us, my deare&s;t grandmam|ma! But you, from your chearful piety, and joyful expectation of happine&s;s &s;upreme, are already, tho' on earth, in heaven!&mdash;Yet it is my wi&s;h, my aunt's, my uncle's, Lucy's, twenty times a day, that you were pre&s;ent, and &s;aw him, The Dome&s;tic man, The chearful Friend, The kind Ma&s;ter, The enlivening Companion, The polite Neighbour, The tender Hu&s;|band! Let nobody who &s;ees Sir Charles Grandi&s;on at home, &s;ay, that the private &s;tation is not that of true happine&s;s.</P>
<P>How charmingly re&s;pectful is he to my uncle, aunt, and good Mr. Deane! To Lucy, he is an affectionate brother. Emily, dear girl, how &s;he enjoys his tender|ne&s;s to her!</P>
<P>My uncle is writing to you, madam, a Letter. He &s;ays, it will be as long as his arm. My aunt will di&s;|patch this day a very long one. Theirs will &s;upply my defects. Lucy is not quite ready with her fir&s;t Letter. If there were not &s;o much of your Harriet in it, I would highly prai&s;e what &s;he has hitherto written.</P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day morning.</HI>] I leave to my uncle the ac|count of the gentlemens diver&s;ions in the gardens and fields. They are all extremely happy. But Lord G. already pines after his Charlotte. He will not be pre|vailed on to &s;tay out his week, I doubt, &s;weet-temper'd man! as I &s;ee him in a thou&s;and little amiable in&s;tances. If Lady G. did not love him, I would not love her. Lord W. is afraid of a gouty attack. He is never quite free. He and his admirable Lady will leave us to-morrow.</P>
<P>I think, my dear Lady G. with you, that di&s;cre|tion and gratitude are the corner-&s;tones of the matri|monial fabric. Lady W. had no prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in any other man's favour. My Lord loves her. What mu&s;t be that woman's heart, that Gratitude and Love
<PB N="36" REF="37">
cannot engage? But &s;he loves my Lord. Surely &s;he does. Is not real and unaffected tenderne&s;s for the infirmities of another, the very e&s;&s;ence of Love; What is wanting where there is that? My Sir Charles is de|lighted with Lady W's goodne&s;s to his uncle. He tells her often, how much he reveres her for it.</P>
<P>In our retired hours, we have &s;ometimes the excel|lent Lady abroad for our Subject. I always begin it.</P>
<P>He never declines it. He &s;peaks of her with &s;uch manly tenderne&s;s! He thanks me, at &s;uch times, for <HI>allowing</HI> him, as he calls it, to love her. He regrets very much the precipitating of her: Yet pities her parents and brothers. How warmly does he &s;peak of his Je|ronymo! He has a &s;igh for Olivia. But of whom, ex|cept Lady Sforza and her Laurana, does he not &s;peak kindly!&mdash;And them he pities. Never, never, was there a more expanded heart!</P>
<P>Ah, madam, a cloud has ju&s;t bru&s;hed by us! Its &s;kirts have affected us with &s;adne&s;s, and carried us from our &s;un&s;hine pro&s;pects <HI>home;</HI> that is to &s;ay, to thoughts of the general de&s;tiny!&mdash;Poor Sir Harry Beauchamp is no more! A Letter from his Beauchamp! Sir Charles &s;hewed it to me, for the honour of the writer, now Sir Edward. We admired this excellent young man together, over his Letter. What fine things did Sir Charles &s;ay on this occa&s;ion, both by way of &s;elf-con|&s;olation, and on the inevitable de&s;tiny! But he dwelt not on the &s;ubject. He has written to Lady Beau|champ, and to the young Baronet. How charmingly con&s;olatory!&mdash;What admirable&mdash;But Sir Charles, ma|dam, is a CHRISTIAN!</P>
<P>THIS event has not at all influenced his temper. He is the &s;ame chearful man to his gue&s;ts; to his Harriet; to every-body. I am afraid it will be the cau&s;e of his fir&s;t ab&s;ence from me: How &s;hall I part with him, tho' it were but for two days?</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="38">
<HI>Friday noon.</HI>] What a vacancy! Lady Mansfield, and her &s;ons, Lord G. and Lord and Lady W. have left us. Mi&s;s Mansfield is allowed to &s;tay with me &s;ome time longer. Emily is very fond of her. No wonder: She is a good young woman.</P>
<P>We are bu&s;ied in returning the vi&s;its of our neigh|bours, which Sir Charles promi&s;ed to do, as if they were individually made to us. We have a very agree|able neighbourhood. But I want the&s;e vi&s;itings to be over. Sir Charles and his relations and mine, are the world to me. The&s;e obligations of ceremony, tho' unavoidable, are drawbacks upon the true do|me&s;tic felicity. One happine&s;s, however, re&s;ults from the hurry and bu&s;tle they put us in: Emily's mind (tho' &s;he not always accompanies us) &s;eems to be engaged: When we are not quite happy in our own thoughts, it is a relief to carry them out of our|&s;elves.</P>
<P>SIR Charles and I have ju&s;t now had a &s;hort con|ver&s;ation about this dear girl. We both joined in prai&s;ing her; and then I &s;aid, I thought, that &s;ome time hence Mr. Beauchamp and &s;he would make a vary happy pair.</P>
<P>I have, &s;aid he, a Love for both. But as the one is my own very particular <HI>friend,</HI> and as the other is my <HI>ward,</HI> I would rather he found for him&s;elf, and &s;he for her&s;elf, another Lover, and that for obvious rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>But, &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, they &s;hould like each the other?</P>
<P>So as they made it not a compliment to me, but gave me rea&s;on to believe, that they would have pre|ferred each the other to every one el&s;e, were they &s;trangers to me, I would not &s;tand in their way. But the man, who hopes for my con&s;ent for Emily, mu&s;t give me rea&s;on to think, that he would have preferred her to any other woman, tho' &s;he had a much le&s;s for|tune than &s;he is mi&s;tre&s;s of.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="39">
I am much mi&s;taken, Sir, if that may not be the ca&s;e of your friend.</P>
<P>Tell me, my nobly frank, and ever-amiable Har|riet, what you know of this &s;ubject. Has Beauchamp any thoughts of Emily?&mdash;</P>
<P>Ah, Sir, thought I, I dare not tell you <HI>all</HI> my thoughts; but what I do tell you, &s;hall be truth.</P>
<P>I really, Sir, don't imagine Emily has a thought of your Beauchamp&mdash;</P>
<P>Nor of any other per&s;on? Has &s;he?&mdash;</P>
<P>Lady G. Lady L. and my&s;elf, are of opinion, that Beauchamp loves Emily.</P>
<P>I am glad, my dear, if any thing were to come of it, that the man loved fir&s;t.</P>
<P>I was con&s;cious. A tear unawares dropt from my eye&mdash;He &s;aw it. He &s;olded his arm about me, and ki&s;&s;ed it from my check. Why, my Love! my deare&s;t Love! why this? and &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t tell you, Sir, that you may not be &s;urpri&s;ed. I fear, I fear&mdash;</P>
<P>What fears m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Love?</P>
<P>That the happie&s;t of all women cannot &s;ay, that her dear man loved her fir&s;t!&mdash;</P>
<P>He folded me in his kind arms. How &s;weetly en|gaging! &s;aid he: I will pre&s;ume to hope, that my Harriet, by the happie&s;t of all women, means her|&s;elf&mdash;You &s;ay not no! I will not in&s;ult your goodne&s;s &s;o much, as to a&s;k you to &s;ay yes. But, this I &s;ay, that the happie&s;t of all men loved his Harriet, before &s;he <HI>could</HI> love him; and, but for the honour he owed to another admirable woman, tho' then he had no hopes of ever calling her his, would have convinced her of it, by a very early declaration. Let me add, that the moment I &s;aw you fir&s;t (di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and terri|fied as you were, too much to think of favour to any man) I loved you: And you know not the &s;truggle it co&s;t me (my de&s;tiny with <HI>our</HI> dear Clementina &s;o un|certain) to conceal my Love&mdash;Co&s;t me, who ever
<PB N="39" REF="40">
was punctiliou&s;ly &s;tudious to avoid engaging a young Lady's affections, le&s;t I &s;hould not be able to be ju&s;t to her; and always thought what is called Platonic Love an in&s;idious preten&s;ion.</P>
<P>O Sir! And I flung my fond arms about his neck, and, hiding my glowing face in his bo&s;om, called him, murmuringly, the mo&s;t ju&s;t, the mo&s;t generous, of men.</P>
<P>He pre&s;&s;ed me &s;till to his heart; and when I rai&s;ed my con&s;cious face, tho' my eye could not bear his, Now, Sir, &s;aid I, after this kind, this encouraging acknowlegement, I can con&s;ent, I <HI>think</HI> I can, that the Lord of my heart &s;hall &s;ee, as he has more than once wi&s;hed to &s;ee, long before he declared him&s;elf, all that was in that forward, that a&s;piring heart.&mdash;</P>
<P>Lucy had furni&s;hed me with the opportunity be|fore. I in&s;tantly aro&s;e, and took out of a drawer a parcel of my Letters, which I had &s;orted ready, on occa&s;ion, to oblige h m, which, from what he had &s;een before, down to the dreadful ma&s;querade affair, carried me to my &s;etting out with his &s;i&s;ters to Colnebrook.</P>
<P>I think not to &s;how him farther, by my own con|&s;ent, becau&s;e of the recapitulation of his family &s;to|ry, which immediately follows; particularly include|ing the affecting accounts of his mother's death; his father's unkindne&s;s to the two young Ladies; Mrs. Oldham's &s;tory; the &s;i&s;ters conduct to her; which might have revived di&s;agreeable &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Be plea&s;ed, Sir, &s;aid I, putting them into his hands, to judge me favourably. In the&s;e papers is my heart laid open.</P>
<P>Precious tru&s;t! &s;aid he, and put the papers to his lips: You will not find your generous confidence mi&s;placed.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER VIII.</HI> Lady <HI>GRANDISON.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Saturday-morning, Dec. <HI>16.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Will not trouble you, my dear grandmamma, with an account of the preparations we are make|ing to benefit and regale our poorer neighbours, and Sir Charles's tenants, at this ho&s;pitable &s;ea&s;on. Not even Sir Charles Grandi&s;on him&s;elf can exceed you, either in bounty or management, on this annual So|lemnity. Sir Charles has con&s;ulted with Dr. Bart|lett, and every-thing will be left to the direction of that good man. My uncle and aunt have di&s;patched their directions to Selby-hou&s;e, that <HI>their</HI> neighbours and tenants may not &s;uffer by their ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>The gentlemen are all rid out together, the Doctor with them, to <HI>reconnoitre</HI> the country, as my uncle calls it. Emily and Lucy are gone with them, on hor&s;eback. My aunt and I declined accompanying them; and took this opportunity, attended by Mrs. Curzon, to go thro' the Offices.</P>
<P>In the hou&s;ekeeper's room, I received the maid|&s;ervants, &s;even in number; and, after her, called each by her name, and &s;poke kindly to them all. I told them how hand&s;omely Mrs. Curzon &s;poke of them, and a&s;&s;ured them of my favour. I prai&s;ed the chearfulne&s;s with which Dr. Bartlett had told me they attended him every day in his antechamber. They &s;hould have the opportunity given them, I &s;aid, as often as po&s;&s;ible. I hoped that my Sally behaved well among them.</P>
<P>They prai&s;ed her.</P>
<P>Sally, &s;aid I, has a &s;erious turn. Piety is the be&s;t &s;ecurity in man and woman for good behaviour. She will &s;eldom fail of attending the Doctor with you. We &s;hall all be happy, I hope. I am acquainting my|&s;elf with the methods of the hou&s;e. Nobody &s;hall
<PB N="41" REF="42">
be put out of their good way by me. My aunt only &s;aid, My niece propo&s;es to <HI>form</HI> her&s;elf on the ex|ample of the late excellent Lady Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>They ble&s;&s;ed me; tears in their eyes.</P>
<P>I made each of them a pre&s;ent for a pair of gloves.</P>
<P>We went thro' all the Offices, the lowe&s;t not ex|cepted. The very &s;ervants live in paradi&s;e. There is room for every thing to be in order Every thing <HI>is</HI> in order. The Offices &s;o di&s;tinct, yet &s;o con|veniently communicating&mdash;Charmingly contrived!&mdash;The low &s;ervants, men and women, have Laws, which at their own reque&s;t, were drawn up, by Mrs. Curzon, for the ob&s;ervance of the minute&s;t of their re&s;pective duties; with little mulcts, that at fir&s;t <HI>only</HI> there was occa&s;ion to exact. It is a hou&s;e of harmony, to my hand. Dear madam! What do good people leave to good people to do? Nothing! Every one knowing and doing his and her duty; and having, by means of their own diligence, time for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I was plea&s;ed with one piece of furniture in the hou&s;ekeeper's room, which neither you, madam, nor my aunt, have in yours. My aunt &s;ays, Selby-hou&s;e &s;hall not be long after her return without it. It is a Servants Library, in three cla&s;&s;es: One of books of <HI>divinity</HI> and <HI>morality:</HI> Another for <HI>hou&s;ewifry:</HI> A third of <HI>hi&s;tory,</HI> true adventures, voyages, and innocent amu&s;ement. I, II, III. are marked on the ca&s;es, and the &s;ame on the back of each book, the more readily to place and re-place them, as a book is taken out for u&s;e. They are bound in buff for &s;trength. A little &s;ine is laid upon whoever puts not a book back in its place. As new books come out, the Doctor buys &s;uch as he thinks proper to range under the&s;e three cla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked, if there were no books of gardening? I was an&s;wered, that the gardener had a little hou&s;e in the garden, in which he had his own books. But her
<PB N="42" REF="43">
ma&s;ter, Mrs. Curzon &s;aid, was him&s;elf a Library of gardening, ordering the greater articles by his own ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Seeing a pretty gla&s;s-ca&s;e in the hou&s;ekeeper's apart|ment, filled with phy&s;ical matters, I a&s;ked, If &s;he di&s;pen&s;ed any of tho&s;e to the &s;ervants, or the poor? Here is, &s;aid &s;he, a collection of all the u&s;eful drugs in medicine: But does not your Lady&s;hip know the noble method that my ma&s;ter has fallen into &s;ince his la&s;t arrival in England? What is that? He gives a &s;alary, madam, to a &s;kilful apothecary; and pays him for his drugs be&s;ides (and the&s;e are his, tho' I have a key to it); and this gentleman di&s;pen&s;es phy&s;ic to all his tenants, who are not able to pay for advice; nor are the poor who are not his tenants, refu&s;ed, when recommended by Dr. Bartlett.</P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ings on his benevolence! &s;aid I. O my aunt! What a happy creature am I! God Almighty, if I di&s;grace not my hu&s;band's beneficence, will love me for his &s;ake!&mdash;Dear creature, &s;aid my aunt&mdash;And for your own two, I hope.</P>
<P>There lives in an hou&s;e, madam, continued Mrs. Curzon, within five miles of this, almo&s;t in the middle of the e&s;tate, and pays no rent, a very worthy young man; brought up, under an eminent &s;urgeon of one of the London ho&s;pitals, who has orders likewi&s;e for attending his tenants in the way of his bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;As al&s;o every ca&s;ualty that happens within di&s;tance, and where another &s;urgeon is not to be met with. And he, I under&s;tand, is paid on a cure actually performed, very hand&s;omely. But if the patient die, his trouble and attendance are only con&s;idered according to the time taken up; except a particular ca&s;e requires con|&s;ideration.</P>
<P>And this &s;urgeon, Mrs. Curzon, this apothecary&mdash;</P>
<P>Are noted, madam, for being good, as well as &s;kil|ful men. My ma&s;ter's te&s;t is, that they are men of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, and good livers: Their con&s;ciences, he &s;ays, are his &s;ecurity.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="44">
How mu&s;t this excellent man be beloved, how re|&s;pected, Mrs. Curzon!</P>
<P>Re&s;pected and beloved, madam!&mdash;Indeed he is&mdash;Mr. Richard Saunders, has often ob&s;erved to me, that if my ma&s;ter either rides or walks in company, tho' of great Lords, people di&s;tingui&s;h <HI>him</HI> by their re|&s;pectful love: To the Lord, they will but &s;eem to lift up their hats, as I may &s;ay; or if women, ju&s;t drop the knee, and look grave, as if they paid re&s;pect to their quality only: But to my ma&s;ter, they pull off their hats to the ground, and bow their whole bodies: They look &s;milingly, and with plea&s;ure and ble&s;&s;ings, as I may &s;ay, in their faces: The good women courte&s;y al&s;o to the ground, turn about when he has pa&s;&s;ed them, and look after him&mdash;God ble&s;s your &s;weet face; and God ble&s;s your dear heart, will they &s;ay&mdash;And the &s;ervants who hear them are <HI>&s;o</HI> de|lighted!&mdash;Don't your Lady&s;hip &s;ee, how all his &s;er|vants love him as they attend him at table? How they watch his eye in &s;ilent reverence&mdash;Indeed, madam, we all adore him; and have prayed morning, noon, and night for his coming hither, and &s;ettling among us. And now is the happy time: Forgive me, ma|dam; I am no flatterer; But we all &s;ay, He has brought another angel to ble&s;s us.</P>
<P>I was forced to lean upon my aunt&mdash;Tears of joy trickled down my cheeks. O, madam, what a happy lot is mine!&mdash;</P>
<P>My uncle wonders I am not proud&mdash;Proud, ma|dam!&mdash;Proud of my inferiority!</P>
<P>We vi&s;ited Mr. Bartlett in his new office. He is a mode&s;t, ingenious young man. I a&s;ked him to give me at his lei&s;ure, a catalogue of the Servants Libra|ry, for my aunt.</P>
<P>O my dear, &s;aid my aunt, had your grandpapa, had your papa, your mamma, lived to this day!&mdash;</P>
<P>I will imagine, &s;aid I, that I &s;ee them looking down from their heaven. They bid me take care to de|&s;erve
<PB N="44" REF="45">
the lot I have drawn; and tell me, that I can only be more happy, when I am <HI>what</HI> and <HI>where</HI> they are.</P>
<P>DR. Bartlett, attended by his &s;ervant, is returned without the gentlemen. I was afraid he was not very well. I followed him up, and told him my appre|hen&s;ions.</P>
<P>He owned afterwards, that he was a little indi&s;|po&s;ed when he came in; but &s;aid, I had made him well.</P>
<P>I told him, what had pa&s;&s;ed between Mrs. Curzon and me. He confirmed all &s;he &s;aid.</P>
<P>He told me, that Sir Charles was careful al&s;o in improving his e&s;tates. The minute&s;t things, he &s;aid, any more than the greate&s;t, e&s;caped not his attention. He has, &s;aid he, a bricklayer, a carpenter, by the year; a &s;awyer, three months con&s;tantly in every year. Repairs are &s;et about the moment they become nece&s;|&s;ary. By this means he is not impo&s;ed upon by in|croaching or craving tenants. He will do any-thing that tends to improve the e&s;tate; &s;o that it is the be&s;t conditioned e&s;tate in the county. His tenants grow into circum&s;tance under him. Tho' ab&s;ent, he gives &s;uch orders, as but few per&s;ons on the &s;pot would think of. He has a di&s;cernment that goes to the bot|tom of every-thing. In a few years, improving only what he has in both kingdoms, he will be very rich, yet an&s;wer the generous demands of his own heart upon his benevolence: All the people he employs he takes upon character of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and &s;obriety, as Mrs. Curzon told you; and then he makes them the more firmly his, by the confidence he repo&s;es in them. He continually, in his written directions to his ma&s;ter|workmen, cautions them to do ju&s;tice to the tenants as well as to him, and even to throw the turn of the &s;cale in their favour. You are, &s;ays he, <HI>my</HI> friends, <HI>my</HI> workmen: You mu&s;t not make me both judge
<PB N="45" REF="46">
and party. Only remember, that I bear not impo|&s;ition. The man who impo&s;es on me once, I will forgive: But he never &s;hall have an opportunity to deceive me a &s;econd time: For I cannot act the part of a &s;u&s;picious man, a watchman over people of <HI>doubtful</HI> hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>The Doctor &s;ays, he is a great planter, both here and in Ireland: And now he is come to &s;ettle here, he will &s;et on foot &s;everal projects, which hitherto he had only talked of, or written about.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, I am &s;ure, &s;aid he, will be the friend of every worthy man and woman. He will find out the &s;ighing heart before it is overwhelmed with ca|lamity.</P>
<P>He propo&s;es, as &s;oon as he is &s;ettled, to take a per&s;onal Survey of his whole e&s;tate. He will make him&s;elf acquainted with every tenant, and even cot|tager, and enquire into his circum&s;tances, number of children, and pro&s;pects. When occa&s;ions call for it, he will forgive arrears of rent; and if the poor men have no pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, he will buy his own farms of them, as I may &s;ay, by giving them money to quit: He will tran&s;plant one to a le&s;s, another to a larger farm, if the tenants con&s;ent, according as they have &s;tock, or probability of &s;ucce&s;s in the one or the other; and will &s;et the poor tenants in a way of cultivating what they hold, as well by advice as money; for while he was abroad, he &s;tudied Hu&s;band|ry and Law, in order, as he u&s;ed to &s;ay, to be his father's &s;teward; the one to qualify him to pre&s;erve, the other to manage, his e&s;tate. He was always pre|pared for, and aforehand with, probable events.</P>
<P>Dear, dear Dr. Bartlett, &s;aid I, we are on a charming &s;ubject; tell me more of my Sir Charles's management and intentions. Tell me all you know, that is proper for me to know.</P>
<P><HI>Proper,</HI> madam! Every-thing he <HI>has</HI> done, <HI>does,</HI> and <HI>intends</HI> to do, is proper for you, and for all the
<PB N="46" REF="47">
world to know. I wi&s;h all the world were to know him, as I do; not for his &s;ake, but for their own.</P>
<P>That moment (without any-body's letting me know the gentlemen were returned) into the Doctor's apart|ment came Sir Charles. My back was to the door, and he was in the room before I &s;aw him. I &s;tarted! Sir, Sir! &s;aid I, as if I thought excu&s;es nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>He &s;aw my confu&s;ion. That, and his &s;udden en|trance, aba&s;hed the Doctor. Sir Charles reconciled us both to our&s;elves&mdash;He put one arm round my wai&s;t, with the other he lifted up my hand to his lips, and in the voice of Love, I congratulate you both, &s;aid he: Such company, my deare&s;t Life! &s;uch company, my deare&s;t friend! you cannot have every hour! May I, as often as there is opportunity, &s;ee you to|gether! I knew not that you were! The Doctor and I, madam, &s;tand not upon ceremony. Pardon me, Doctor. I in&s;i&s;t upon leaving you as I found you&mdash;</P>
<P>I caught his hand, as he was going&mdash;Dear, dear Sir, I attend you. You &s;hall take me with you; and, if you plea&s;e, make my excu&s;es to my aunt, for leaving her &s;o long alone, before you came in.</P>
<P>Doctor, excu&s;e us both; my Harriet has found, for the fir&s;t time, a will. It is her own, we know, by its obligingne&s;s.</P>
<P>He received my offered hand, and led me into com|pany: Where my aunt called me to account for leaving her, and begged Sir Charles would chide me.</P>
<P>She was with Dr. Bartlett, madam, &s;aid he: Had &s;he been with any other per&s;on, man or woman, and Mrs. Selby, alone, I think we would have <HI>tried</HI> to chide her.</P>
<P>What obligation, what &s;weet politene&s;s, my dear grandmamma!</P>
<P>Such, madam, is the happine&s;s of your Harriet.</P>
<P>Lucy has a charming Letter to &s;end you!&mdash;From that Letter, you will have a &s;till higher notion of my happine&s;s, of the dear man's unaffected tenderne&s;s to
<PB N="47" REF="48">
me, and of the approbation of a very genteel neigh|bourhood, than I my&s;elf could give you.</P>
<P>Lady G. and Lady L. have both made up for their &s;uppo&s;ed neglects. I had written to each to charge them with having not congratulated me on my ar|rival here. Two &s;uch charming Letters!&mdash;I have already an&s;wered them. The love as well as over (Thank heaven they do!)</P>

<P>THE deare&s;t, be&s;t of men, has left me! Ju&s;t now left me!&mdash;Did not every-body keep me in coun|tenance, I &s;hould be very angry with my&s;elf for wi&s;h|ing that <HI>&s;uch</HI> a man &s;hould be always confined to my company! I mu&s;t keep my fondne&s;s within equi|table bounds. But, kind man! he &s;eemed, and, if he <HI>&s;eemed,</HI> he <HI>was,</HI> as loth to part with me. He is gone to London, madam: Poor Lady Beauchamp has be|&s;ought his pre&s;ence, not at Sir Harry's funeral (He was to be interred, it &s;eems la&s;t night) but at the opening of the will: And his Beauchamp joined in the reque&s;t.</P>
<P>He hopes to be down with us on Thur&s;day. Mi&s;s Mansfield took the opportunity to return to her mother, who &s;ent word, that &s;he knew not how to live without her.</P>
<P>Sir Charles was plea&s;ed to give to me the keys of his Study, and of Lady Olivia's Cabinets. Lucy gave you, madam, an account of the invaluable contents. And now I will amu&s;e my&s;elf there, and &s;it in every chair, where I have &s;een him &s;it, and tread over his imagined foot&s;teps.</P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day.</HI>] My books are come, and all my trinkets
<PB N="48" REF="49">
with them. We have all been bu&s;y in cla&s;&s;ing the books. My clo&s;et will be now furni&s;hed as I wi&s;h it: And I &s;hall look at the&s;e, my dear companions of Selby-hou&s;e, and recollect the many, many happy hours they gave me there.</P>
<P>Was I ever, ever unhappy, my dear Grandmamma? If I was, I have forgot the time. I acquie&s;ce chear|fully with your wi&s;hes not to dis-furni&s;h your gallery, by &s;ending to me our family pictures. Let tho&s;e of my benevolent father and my excellent mother, of happy, happy memory, &s;till continue there to &s;mile upon you, as you are plea&s;ed to expre&s;s your&s;elf. No|body but you and my aunt Selby have a right to each of tho&s;e of mine, which are honoured with a place in your re&s;pective drawing-rooms.

<P>A Trea&s;ure, an invaluable trea&s;ure, my dear grandmamma!&mdash;On the table in Sir Charles's own clo&s;et, I took up a common-prayer-book, under which, on removing it, I &s;aw a paper written in Sir Charles's large&s;t hand, the three la&s;t Lines of which apppearing to be very &s;erious (the fir&s;t &s;ide not con|taining them) I had the curio&s;ity to unfold it: it con|tains Reflections, mingled and concluded with &s;olemn addre&s;&s;es to the Almighty.

<P>What a comfort is it, on reflection, that, at his own motion, I joined with him in the Sacramental Office, on occa&s;ion of our happy nuptials, the fir&s;t opportunity that offered!

No wonder that the good man, who could draw up &s;uch reflections, &s;hould make &s;uch a motion.</P>
<P>What credit did he do (may not one &s;ay &s;o?) To religion on that happy day!

<P>WHAT, O my heart! overflowing with happi|ne&s;s! are the &s;entiments that ought to &s;pring up in thee, when admitted either in the &s;olemnities of public wor&s;hip, or the retiredne&s;s of private devo|tion, into the more immediate pre&s;ence of thy MAKER! Who does not govern, but to ble&s;s! Who&s;e divine commands are &s;ent to &s;uccour human rea&s;on in &s;earch of happine&s;s!</P>
<P>Let thy Law, ALMIGHTY! be the rule, and thy glory the con&s;tant end, of all I do! Let me not build virtue on any notions of honour, but of honour to thy Name. Let me not &s;ink piety in the boa&s;t of benevolence; my Love of God in the Love of my fellow-creatures. Can good be of human growth? No! It is thy gift, Almighty, And All-good! Let not thy bounties re|move the Donor from my thought; nor the Love of plea&s;ures make me for&s;ake the Fountain from which they flow. When joys entice, let me a&s;k their title to my heart. When evils threaten, let me &s;ee thy mercy &s;hining thro' the cloud; and di&s;cern the great hazard of having all to my wi&s;h. In an age of &s;uch licence, let me not take comfort from an inau&s;pici|ous omen, the number of tho&s;e who do ami&s;s: An omen rather of public ruin, than of private &s;afety. Let the joys of the multitude le&s;s allure than alarm me; and their danger, not example, determine my choice. What weigh public example, pa&s;&s;ion, and the multitude, in one &s;eale, again&s;t Rea&s;on, and the Almighty, in the other?</P>
<P>In this day of domineering <HI>plea&s;ure,</HI> &s;o <HI>lower</HI> my ta&s;te, as to make me reli&s;h the <HI>comforts</HI> of Life. And in this day of di&s;&s;ipation, O give me thought &s;ufficient

to pre&s;erve me from being &s;o de&s;perate, as in this per|petual flux of things, and as perpetual &s;warm of ac|cidents, to depend on <HI>To-morrow:</HI> A dependence that is the ruin of <HI>To-day;</HI> as that is of <HI>Eternity.</HI> Let my whole exi&s;tence be ever before me: Nor let the ter|rors of the grave turn back my &s;urvey.

<P>SIR Charles, God be prai&s;ed! arrived here in &s;afety about two hours ago. He has &s;ettled every thing between Lady Beauchamp and the now Sir Ed|ward,
<PB N="53" REF="54">
to the &s;atisfaction of both; for they entirely referred them&s;elves to him. This was the method he took.&mdash;As their intere&s;ts were not naturally the &s;ame, he enquired of each &s;eparately, what were the wi&s;hes of each; and finding the Lady's not unrea&s;on|able, he referred it to Sir Edward, of his own genero|&s;ity, to compliment her with more than &s;he a&s;ked.</P>
<P>Particularly &s;he had wi&s;hed to Sir Charles, that &s;he might not be obliged to remove under a twelve|month from the hou&s;e in Berkley-&s;quare: And when Sir Charles had brought them together, and pronounced between them, making that an article, Sir Edward, on one knee, thus be&s;poke her:</P>
<P>All that your Lady&s;hip demands I mo&s;t chear|fully comply with. In&s;tead of the year you wi&s;h to remain in Berkley-&s;quare, let me beg of you, &s;till to con&s;ider both hou&s;es as your own; and me your in|mate only, as in the life-time of my father. I never will engage in marriage, but with your approbation: Let us, madam, be as little as po&s;&s;ible &s;eparated: Be plea&s;ed only to di&s;tingui&s;h, that I wi&s;h not this, but from pure and di&s;intere&s;ted motives. I will be your &s;ervant as well as &s;on. I will take all trouble from you that you &s;hall think trouble; but never will offer &s;o much as my humble advice to you in the conduct of your own affairs, unle&s;s you a&s;k for it.</P>
<P>She wept. We will henceforth, &s;aid &s;he, have but one intere&s;t. You &s;hall be dear to me, for your father's &s;ake. Let me, for the &s;ame dear &s;ake, be regarded by you: Receive me, excellent pair of friends, proceeded &s;he, as a third in your friend&s;hip. Should any mi&s;under&s;tanding ari&s;e, which, after &s;o happy a &s;etting out, I hope, cannot be, let Sir Charles Gran|di&s;on determine between us. Ju&s;tice and He are one.</P>
<P>Sir Charles invited down to us the Lady and his Beauchamp. He hopes they will come. The young Baronet, I dare &s;ay, will. Emily &s;ays, &s;he wants to
<PB N="54" REF="55">
&s;ee how he will become his new dignity. Very well, I dare &s;ay, &s;aid I. Why yes; &s;uch an example before him, I don't doubt but he will.</P>
<P>Lucy was pre&s;ent. Near 4000<HI>l.</HI> a year, and a title, &s;aid &s;he&mdash;I think you and I, my dear, were we nearer of an age, would contend for him.</P>
<P>Not I, Mi&s;s Selby: So that I have the Love of my Guardian and Lady Grandi&s;on, you may be Lady Beauchamp for me.&mdash;You will be of another mind, perhaps, &s;ome time hence, &s;aid Mi&s;s Selby&mdash;When I am, replied Emily, tell me of it.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, when he was in town, vi&s;ited his two &s;i&s;ters. He gave me the plea&s;ure of acquainting me, that we &s;hall be favoured with the company of Lord and Lady L. as &s;oon as her Lady&s;hip's vi&s;its and vi&s;it|ings are over.</P>
<P>Mind, my dear Lady G. what follows:</P>
<P>Lady L. &s;aid he, is all joy, that her great event is happily over; &s;he and my Lord rewarded with a dear pledge of their mutual Love. But is not Lady G. a little unaccountable, my dear?</P>
<P>As how, Sir?</P>
<P>She hardly &s;eems to receive plea&s;ure in her happy pro&s;pects. She appears to me peevi&s;h, even childi&s;hly &s;o, to her Lord. I &s;ee it the more for her endeavours to check her&s;elf before me. She &s;ubmits but ungra|ciou&s;ly to the requi&s;ites of the circum&s;tances, that lays him and me, and our &s;everal united families under obligation to her. I was unwilling to take notice of her particular behaviour, for two rea&s;ons; fir&s;t, be|cau&s;e &s;he wants not under&s;tanding, and would &s;ee her own error before &s;he went too far; and next, becau&s;e &s;he tacitly confe&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to be wrong, by being evi|dently de&s;irous to hide her fault from me. But is not <HI>our</HI> Charlotte a little unaccountable, my dear?</P>
<P>What, my dear Lady G. &s;hould I have an&s;wered? I hope you will allow me to be ju&s;t. I &s;hould have been mo&s;t &s;incerely glad to have &s;poken a good word
<PB N="55" REF="56">
for you: But to attempt to excu&s;e or palliate an evi|dent fault, looks like a claim put in for allowances for one's own.</P>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Indeed, Sir, &s;he is a <HI>very</HI> unaccountable creature! She is afraid of you, and of nobody but you. You &s;hould, as &s;he could not conceal from you her odd behaviour to one of the be&s;t of hu&s;bands, and &s;weete&s;t-temper'd of men, who loves her more than he loves him&s;elf; and who is but too &s;olicitous to oblige &s;o unthankful a thing; have taken notice of it, and chidden her <HI>&s;everely:</HI> I, for my part, take liberties of this kind with her in every Letter I write; but to no purpo&s;e. I <HI>wanted</HI> you, Sir, to find her out your&s;elf; &s;he will get a ha|bit of doing wrong things; and make her&s;elf more unhappy than &s;he will make any-body el&s;e; &s;ince it is po&s;&s;ible for her to tire out her Lord. How in&s;up|portable to her of all women, would it be, were the tables to be turned; and were the man &s;he treats &s;o ungraciou&s;ly, to be brought to &s;light her? The more in&s;upportable, as &s;he has a higher opinion of her own under&s;tanding than &s;he has of his!"</Q>
<P>Can't you form to your&s;elf, my dear Lady, G. the attitude of a&s;toni&s;hment, that your brother threw him&s;elf into?&mdash;</P>
<P>But, ah, my dear grandmamma, do you think I &s;aid this to Sir Charles?&mdash;No, indeed! For the world, I would not have &s;aid one &s;yllable of it. But let Lady G. for a moment, as &s;he reads my Letter, think I did. She loves to &s;urprize; why &s;hould &s;he not be &s;urprized in turn? Her di&s;plea&s;ure would af|fect me greatly: But if by incurring it I could do her good, and put her in a right train of thinking, I <HI>would</HI> incur it, and on my knees afterwards beg her to forgive me.</P>
<P>He did make the above ob&s;ervation. A thou&s;and excellent qualities has my Charlotte. I particularized to her brother half a dozen, and tho&s;e are more than
<PB N="56" REF="57">
fall to the &s;hare of mo&s;t of our modern people of qua|lity; and he was willing to be &s;atisfied with them&mdash;Why? Becau&s;e he loves her. But, as &s;he now-and-then whi&s;pers her Harriet, in her Letters, let me whi&s;|per her, that &s;he is under great obligation to her bro|ther, and &s;till greater to her Lord, for pa&s;&s;ing over &s;o lightly her petulances.</P>

<P>WHO, madam, do you think, is arrived? Arrived ju&s;t as we &s;at down to dinner; and will &s;tay with us this one night, but, he &s;ays, no more?&mdash;Sir Rowland Meredith! Good Man! and Mr. Fowler! The latter attended his uncle reluctantly, it &s;eems; but, thank God, he is in pretty good health. How kindly, how affectionately, did Sir Charles receive them both! How has he already won the heart of hone&s;t Sir Row|land!</P>
<P>LET me, madam, acquaint you with &s;omething generou&s;ly particular of this worthy man.</P>
<P>He de&s;ired Sir Charles to let him have me by him|&s;elf for one quarter of an hour. So fine a young gen|tleman would not, he hoped, be jealous of &s;uch a poor old man as he.</P>
<P>We were in the dining-room; and he ri&s;ing to at|tend me, I led him to my drawing-room adjoining. He looked round him, and was &s;truck with the ele|gance of the room and furniture; di&s;regarding me for a few moments&mdash;Why, ay! &s;aid he, at la&s;t; This is noble! This is fine! Stately, by mercy! And he bowed to me, poor man! the more re&s;pectfully, as I thought, for what he &s;aw. And will you, madam, bowing again, and again, allow me to call you <HI>daugh|ter?</HI> I can't part with my <HI>daughter&punc;</HI> Nor would I, were you a queen.</P>
<P>You do me honour, Sir Rowland. Call me <HI>&s;till</HI> your daughter.</P>
<P>Why then, you mu&s;t allow me&mdash;Forgive me, ma|dam!
<PB N="57" REF="58">
&mdash;And he &s;aluted me. Joy, joy, tenfold joy, attend my daughter! I don't know what to make of the pre&s;ent fa&s;hions. Would Sir Charles have been affronted, had I taken this liberty before him? The duce is in the pre&s;ent age; they re&s;erve them&s;elves to holes and corners, I &s;uppo&s;e. But I am &s;ure no crea|ture breathing could mean more re&s;pect than I do. I think only of my&s;elf as of your <HI>father.</HI></P>
<P>You are a good man, Sir Rowland. Sir Charles Grandi&s;on was prepared to love you; he was prepared to value Mr. Fowler.</P>
<P>Prepared by your own re&s;pect for us, madam!&mdash;God love you, &s;ay yes.</P>
<P>Yes indeed, I ever &s;hall re&s;pect you both. Have I not claimed a father in you? Have I not claimed a brother in your nephew? I never forget my rela|tions.</P>
<P>Charming, charming, by mercy! And he &s;talked to the other end of the room, wiping his eyes: The very &s;ame good young Lady that you ever were! But, but, but, putting his hand in his pocket, and pulling out a little box, if you are my daughter, you &s;hall wear the&s;e for your father's &s;ake!&mdash;How now, madam! Refu&s;e me! I command you on your obe|dience to accept of this&mdash;I will not be a Jack-&s;traw fa|ther&mdash;</P>
<P>Indeed, indeed, Sir Rowland, you mu&s;t excu&s;e me; I thought I might have tru&s;ted my&s;elf with you alone. Your genero&s;ity, Sir, is painful to me.</P>
<P>I courte&s;ied, and withdrew to the company in the dining-room. The good man followed me, te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rs upon his cheeks, the box in his hand: My face glowed.</P>
<P>She calls me father, Sir Charles; and refu&s;es her obedience. Here I have brought a toy or two, to &s;hew my fatherly Love to my daughter. Not a &s;oul, not my nephew there, knows a &s;yllable of the matter; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t was that made me call her a&s;ide.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="59">
Sir Charles ro&s;e from his &s;eat. My deare&s;t Life is not u&s;ed, &s;aid he, to make light of a duty; taking my hand. You will excu&s;e her from accepting the pre&s;ent, Sir Rowland; that would look as if you thought it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to bribe her to do her duty. She will always acknowledge her father: So will I mine. But you do us honour enough in the relation.</P>
<P>What, Sir Charles, not of a pre&s;ent from her fa|ther to his daughter, on her nuptials, and as a &s;mall token of his joy on the occa&s;ion; when I know not the man living, out of my own family&mdash;There he &s;topt.</P>
<P>My deare&s;t Love, there is no re&s;i&s;ting this plea: Your duty, yourgratitude, is engaged.</P>
<P>Look you there now! Look you there now! God love you both everla&s;tingly, Amen!&mdash;And there is the ble&s;&s;ing of a father!</P>
<P>I took the box, court&s;ying low; but looked &s;illy, I believe.</P>
<P>Forgive me, Sir Charles, &s;aid the Knight; but I mu&s;t&mdash;He took my hand, and ki&s;&s;ed it&mdash;and looked as if he wi&s;hed to &s;alute me&mdash;Fathers, my dear, mu&s;t be reverenced, &s;aid Sir Charles, by their children.</P>
<P>I bent my knee, and, in compliance with a motion of Sir Charles, leaned forward my cheek, He &s;aluted me&punc; and again he ble&s;&s;ed us both&mdash;My dear nephew, &s;aid he, ha&s;tening to Mr. Fowler, if you envy &s;uch a man as this his good fortune, by mercy I will renounce you.</P>
<P>I <HI>may</HI> envy you, Sir Charles, &s;aid Mr. Fowler, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to him in an agreeable manner; I don't know how it is po&s;&s;ible to avoid it; but at the &s;ame time I revere you for your character and ac|compli&s;hments. You are the only man in the world whom I could cordially congratulate, as I do you on your happine&s;s.</P>
<P>True, nephew, true: I, any more than you, &s;hould never have enjoyed my&s;elf, had any of the feather|headed
<PB N="59" REF="60">
creatures I &s;aw formerly endeavouring to make an intere&s;t in my daughter's favour, &s;ucceeded with her. But you, madam, have cho&s;en a man that every-body mu&s;t prefer to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Knight, after tea, moved to have the box opened. When Sir Charles &s;aw the jewels, he was a little unea&s;y, becau&s;e of the value of them. A co&s;tly diamond necklace and ear-rings, a ring of price, a repeating watch finely cha&s;ed; the chain of which is richly ornamented; one of the appendages is a picture of Sir Rowland in enamel, adorned with brilliants; an admirable Likene&s;s: This I told him was more valuable to me than all the re&s;t: I &s;poke truth; for &s;o rich a pre&s;ent has made me unea&s;y. He &s;aw I was. He knew, he &s;aid, that I could not want any of the&s;e things: But he could not think of any other way to &s;hew his Love to his daughter. It was nothing to what he had intended to do in his Will; had I not intimated to him, that what he left me, &s;hould be given among his relations. I am rich, madam, I can tell you: And what, on your nuptials, could I do le&s;s for my daughter?</P>
<P>Sir Charles &s;aid, This mu&s;t not end &s;o, Sir Row|land: But I &s;ee you are an invincible man. Mr. Fowler, I wi&s;h you as happily married as you de|&s;erve to be: Your Lady will be intitled to a return of equal value.</P>
<P>Sir Rowland begged, that he might try on the ring him&s;elf. He was allowed to do &s;o, and was plea&s;ed it was not <HI>much</HI> too big. He &s;aid I &s;hould not pull it off this night. I kept it on to humour the wor|thy man.</P>
<P>SUPPER over, and a chearful gla&s;s going round with my uncle, Mr. Deane, and the Knight, Sir Row|land made it his odd reque&s;t, that I would permit Sir Charles to put on the necklace for me. By all means, I &s;aid. But the Knight being very earne&s;t,
<PB N="60" REF="61">
and my uncle &s;econding him (for there was particula|rity enough in the motion, to engage the dear odd man) and Sir Charles not di&s;couraging it, my aunt and Lucy &s;miling all the time, I thought I had better comply, le&s;t the Knight &s;hould take it into his head to reque&s;t the putting it on him&s;elf. Yet I was the more reluctant, on poor Mr. Fowler's account; for his &s;miles were but e&s;&s;ays to &s;mile. Sir Charles, in his own graceful manner, put it on; bowing low to me, in the gallante&s;t manner, when he had done. I courte&s;ied to him, to Sir Rowland, and looked &s;illy I am &s;ure.</P>

<P>SIR Rowland and Mr. Fowler have le&s;t us. They would not &s;tay to dinner. They have bu&s;ine&s;s to di&s;|patch in town, that will take them up &s;ome days: But they were &s;o well plea&s;ed with their reception, that they promi&s;e to &s;ee us before they &s;et out for Caer|marthen.</P>
<P>At parting, Sir Rowland drew me a&s;ide: Your cou&s;in Lucy, as you call her, is a fine young Lady. They tell me, that &s;he has a great fortune: But I matter not that of a &s;traw&mdash;Would to God, my boy knew how to &s;ubmit to his de&s;tiny like a man&mdash;Hem! You under&s;tand me, madam&mdash;Mercy! I want to be akin to you&mdash;You take me, madam.</P>
<P>We <HI>are</HI> akin. Sir Rowland Meredith is my fa|ther.</P>
<P>God ble&s;s you, madam! I love you dearly for that. And &s;o we are: But you under&s;tand me: A word to the wi&s;e: She is not engaged; is &s;he?&mdash;I love your uncle of all men&mdash;except the king of all men; your Lord and ma&s;ter&mdash;God ble&s;s him! With what good humour he eyes us&mdash;Sir Charles, one word with you, if you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>I thought the Knight had his fingers ready to take hold of Sir Charles's button; for his hand was ex|tended; but &s;uddenly, as from recollection, with|drawn.
<PB N="61" REF="62">
He led Sir Charles to me&mdash;And put the &s;ame que&s;tion to him, as he had done to me.</P>
<P>Let me a&s;k you, my dear Sir Rowland, Was this in your thought before you came hither?</P>
<P>No, by mercy!&mdash;It ju&s;t now &s;truck me. My ne|phew knew not a &s;yllable of the matter. But why, you know, Sir Charles, &s;hould a man pine and die, becau&s;e he cannot have the <HI>&s;he</HI> that he loves?&mdash;Sup|po&s;e, you know, &s;ix men love one woman, as has been the ca&s;e here, for aught I know; what a duce, are five of them to hang, drown, or pi&s;tol them&s;elves? Or are they to out-&s;tay their time, as I have done, till they are fit for no-body?</P>
<P>Women mu&s;t be treated with delicacy, Sir Rowland. Mi&s;s Selby is a young Lady of great merit. When que&s;tions are properly a&s;ked, you hardly need to doubt of a proper an&s;wer.</P>
<P>But, Sir Charles, is Mi&s;s Selby, <HI>bona fide,</HI> engaged, or is &s;he not? that's the que&s;tion I a&s;k: If &s;he be, I &s;hall not &s;ay a word of the matter.</P>
<P>My dear? &s;aid Sir Charles to me.</P>
<P>I don't know that &s;he is, an&s;wered I. But Lucy will never think of a man, be his qualifications ever &s;o great, if he cannot give her proofs of loving her a|bove all women.</P>
<P>I under&s;tand you, madam&mdash;Well, well, and I &s;hould be nice too, I can tell you, for my boy. But I'll &s;ound him. I mu&s;t have him married before I die, if po&s;&s;ible. But no more of that for the pre&s;ent. And now God Almighty ble&s;s, pre&s;erve, and keep you both!&mdash;I will pray for the continuance of your happine&s;s.</P>
<P>He ki&s;&s;ed my hand: Wrung Sir Charles's: Wiped his eyes: Made his bow: And &s;tept into the chariot to his nephew, who had taken leave of us all before.</P>
<P>Lucy, with an air <HI>&s;o</HI> like &s;ome of dear Lady G's, put up her &s;aucy lip, when I told her of this; and bid me not write it to you: But I thought, were
<PB N="62" REF="63">

<HEAD>LETTER. XII. Lady <HI>GRANDISON.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Tue&s;day, Jan. <HI>9.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Have been obliged, by the ju&s;t demands made up|on us by the equally-&s;olemn and joyful &s;ea&s;on, to be &s;ilent for many days. You, madam, and you, Ladies L. and G. have, I doubt not, been engaged in con&s;equence of the &s;ame demand;&mdash;&s;o will excu&s;e me; e&s;pecially as Lucy and my aunt have both writ|ten, and that very minutely, in the interim.</P>
<P>Mr. Deane, to our great joy, has &s;ignified to us his intention to live near us; and to pre&s;ent his hou&s;e at Peterborough to one of his two nephews.</P>
<P>Sir Charles has be&s;ought him to con&s;ider Grandi|&s;on-hall as his own hou&s;e. He promi&s;es that he will. I hope, by my care of him, to be an humble means of prolonging his life, at lea&s;t of making his latter days chearful.</P>
<P>What a happy &s;ea&s;on has this been to &s;cores of peo|ple in our neighbourhood! but mo&s;t to our&s;elves, as the giver is more ble&s;&s;ed than the receiver! Such ad|mirable management! Such good order!&mdash;But I told you, that all was left to Dr. Bartlett's direction: What a ble&s;&s;ing is he to us, and all around him!</P>
<P>Sir Charles has a Letter from Mr. Lowther, who is on his return from Bologna. By the date it &s;hould have arrived a fortnight ago: So that he may be every day expected.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="64">
Mr. Lowther lets him know, that the family at Bologna are all in &s;pirits, on the pro&s;pect they have of carrying their point with Lady Clementina; who, however, for the pre&s;ent, declines the vi&s;its of the Count of Belvedere; and they humour her in that particular.</P>
<P>Mr. Lowther is afraid, he &s;ays, that all is not quite right as to her mind. Poor Lady! He judges &s;o, from the very great earne&s;tne&s;s &s;he continues to expre&s;s to make a vi&s;it to England.</P>
<P>She received, he &s;ays, with great intrepidity, the news of Sir Charles's marriage. She be&s;ought a ble&s;&s;|ing upon him and his bride: but &s;ince has been thought|ful, re&s;erved, and &s;ometimes is found in tears. When challenged, &s;he a&s;cribed, once, her grief to her ap|prehen&s;ions that her malady may po&s;&s;ibly return.</P>
<P>The phy&s;icians have ab&s;olutely given their opinion, that &s;he &s;hould marry.</P>
<P>The General is expected from Naples to urge the &s;olemnity; and vows, that he will not return till &s;he is actually Counte&s;s of Belvedere.</P>
<P>She begs, that &s;he may be allowed again to pa&s;s the Apennines, and vi&s;it Mrs. Beaumont at Florence, in order to &s;ettle her mind.</P>
<P>She dreads to &s;ee the General.</P>
<P>How I am grieved for her!&mdash;Sir Charles mu&s;t be afflicted too. Why, why, will they not leave to time, the pacifier of every woe, the i&s;&s;ue of the event upon which they have &s;et their hearts?</P>
<P>Mr. Lowther writes, that Signor Jeronymo is in a fine way.</P>
<P>Mr. Lowther in his Letter acquits Sir Charles of all obligation to him&s;elf. He returns him bills for the &s;um he had advanced; and declares, that he never will enter into his pre&s;ence, if he refu&s;es to accept of his acquittance. The family, he tells him, have no|bly rewarded him.</P>
<P>Dr. Bartlett applauds Mr. Lowther's &s;pirit on this
<PB N="64" REF="65">
occa&s;ion. As Sir Charles, he &s;ays, is not an o&s;tenta|tious man, but judges of every thing, according to the rules of right and prudence, he has no doubt (tho' he might not expect this hand&s;ome treatment) but he will acquie&s;ce with it. This, however, le&s;&s;ens not the <HI>comparative</HI> merit of Mr. Lowther. There are men, I believe, who having &s;ucceeded &s;o well, would have accepted of a reward from both parties. Yet, on recollection, Sir Charles &s;tipulated with Mr. Low|ther, that he &s;hould receive no fee, but from him&s;elf: And his pre&s;ent to the worthy man was the ampler on that account.</P>
<P>I have two charming Letters from the Counte&s;s of D. By her permi&s;&s;ion, I have &s;hewn to Sir Charles the corre&s;pondence between that good Lady and me. He greatly admires her. She de&s;ires, that he will be acquainted with her &s;on; and declares, &s;he will always look upon me as her daughter, and call me &s;o. Sir Charles bids me tell her, that he cannot con&s;ent to her calling me &s;o, unle&s;s &s;he will look upon him as her &s;on, and unle&s;s my Lord will allow him to call him brother. He bid me expre&s;s his wi&s;hes of a friend&s;hip with both, an&s;werable to that de&s;irable re|lation.</P>
<P>My uncle &s;ays, he knows not &s;uch a place as Sel|by-hou&s;e. Shirley-manor indeed he loves for the &s;ake of the dear mi&s;tre&s;s of it: But, as long as he has with him his Dame, his Harriet, Mr. Deane, and Sir Charles, he is happy. Yet my aunt now-and-then gets upon a ri&s;ing ground in the park, and a&s;ks, pointing, Does not Northampton&s;hire lie off there?</P>
<P>Emily is very good in the main. Dear girl! I do pity her. Her young heart, &s;o <HI>early</HI> to be tried and tormented by the &s;tings of hopele&s;s Love!&mdash;Her eyes ju&s;t now were fixed for &s;everal minutes, &s;o much Love in them! on the face of her guardian, that his mode&s;t eye &s;ell under them.</P>
<P>I will give you, on this occa&s;ion, the particulars
<PB N="65" REF="66">
of a conver&s;ation, that pa&s;&s;ed between us; which, at the conclu&s;ion, let in a little dawn of hope, that the dear girl may be happy in time.</P>
<P>I had more than once been apprehen&s;ive, that her eyes would betray her to her guardian; who at pre|&s;ent imputes all her reverence for him to gratitude; and as &s;oon as he was withdrawn, with a true &s;i&s;terly tenderne&s;s, Come hither, my Love, &s;aid I. I was bu&s;y with my needle&mdash;She came.</P>
<P>My deare&s;t Emily, if you were to look with &s;o much earne&s;tne&s;s in the face of any other man, as you &s;ometimes do, and ju&s;t now did, in that of your guardian, and the man a &s;ingle man, he would have hope of a wife.</P>
<P>High-ho! &s;ighed &s;he. Did my guardian mind me?&mdash;I hope he did not &s;o much, madam, as you do.</P>
<P>So much as I do, my Love!</P>
<P>Yes, madam. When my guardian is pre&s;ent, you do look very hard at me: But I hope, I am not a confident girl.</P>
<P>You are &s;erious, my Emily!</P>
<P>And &s;o is my dear Lady Grandi&s;on!</P>
<P>I was a little &s;urpri&s;ed. The child aba&s;hed me. Her Love, thought I, will make her hardy, without intending to be &s;o.</P>
<P>She was too innocent even for con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having di&s;concerted me. She looked upon my work: What would I give, madam, to be &s;o fine a work|woman as you?&mdash;But why that &s;igh, madam?</P>
<P>The poor Lady Clementina! &s;aid I: I was really thinking of her.</P>
<P>Do you &s;igh for every-body, madam, that loves my guardian?</P>
<P>There are different &s;orts of Love, Emily.</P>
<P>Why &s;o I think. Nobody loves my guardian bet|ter than I my&s;elf do: But it is not the Love that Lady Clementina bears him. I love his goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>And does not Clemementina?</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="67">
Yes, yes, but &s;till the Love is different.</P>
<P>Explain, my dear, your kind of Love.</P>
<P>Impo&s;&s;ible!</P>
<P>Why, now, &s;ighs my Emily? You a&s;ked me why I &s;ighed. I have an&s;wered it was from pity.</P>
<P>Why, madam, I can pity Lady Clementina, and I do: But I &s;igh not for her; becau&s;e &s;he might have had my guardian, and would not.</P>
<P>I &s;igh for her the more, for that very rea&s;on, Emi|ly; her motive &s;o great!</P>
<P>Pho, pho, her <HI>motive!</HI> When he would have al|lowed her to be of her own religion!</P>
<P>Then you &s;igh not now for Clementina, Emily?</P>
<P>I believe not.</P>
<P>For whom then?</P>
<P>I don't know. You mu&s;t not a&s;k. A habit, and nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P>Again &s;ighs my Emily?</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not mind me, madam. A habit, I tell you. But, believe me, Lady Grandi&s;on (hiding her blu&s;hing face in my bo&s;om, her arms about my neck) I believe, if the truth were known&mdash;</P>
<P>She &s;topt, but continued there her glowing cheek&mdash;</P>
<P>What, my dear, if the truth were known?</P>
<P>I dare not tell you. You will be angry at me.</P>
<P>Indeed, my love, I will not.</P>
<P>O yes, but you will.</P>
<P>I thought we had been &s;i&s;ters, my dear. I thought we were to have no &s;ecrets. Tell me, <HI>what,</HI> if the truth were known?</P>
<P>Why, madam, for a trial of your forgivingne&s;s, tell me, Are you not <HI>apt</HI> to be a little jealous?</P>
<P>Jealous, my Emily! You &s;urpri&s;e me! <HI>Why,</HI> of <HI>whom,</HI> of <HI>what,</HI> jealous? Jealou&s;y is doubt; of whom &s;hould I doubt?</P>
<P>People have not always cau&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e, madam.</P>
<P>Explain your&s;elf, my dear.</P>
<P>Are you not angry with me, madam?</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="68">
I am not. But why do you think me jealous?</P>
<P>You need not, indeed! My guardian adores you. You de&s;erve to be adored.&mdash;But you &s;hould allow a poor girl to look upon her guardian now-and-then, with eyes of gratitude. Your charming eye is <HI>&s;o</HI> ready to take mine to ta&s;k!&mdash;I am, if I know my&s;elf, a poor innocent girl. I do love my guardian, that's certain: So I ever did, you know, madam: And let me &s;ay, before he knew there was &s;uch a Lady in the world as your&s;elf, madam.</P>
<P>I threw a&s;ide my work, and cla&s;ping my arms about her, And love him &s;till, my Emily. You cannot love him &s;o well as he de&s;erves. You are indeed a dear innocent, but not a <HI>poor,</HI> girl. You are <HI>rich</HI> in the return of his Love. I will ever, ever, be a pro|moter of an affection &s;o innocent, &s;o pure on both &s;ides. But <HI>jealou&s;y,</HI> my dear! do you charge <HI>me</HI> with <HI>jealou&s;y?</HI> Impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould de&s;erve it! My only concern is, le&s;t, as the heart is gue&s;&s;ed at by the eyes (the hearts of young creatures e&s;pecially, who&s;e good minds are incapable of art or de&s;ign) you &s;hould give room for the cen&s;orious, who know not as I do, that your Love is reverence next to filial, to attribute it to a beginning of the other &s;ort of Love; which yet in you, were it kindled, would be as bright and as pure a flame as ever warmed a virgin heart.</P>
<P>O madam! how you expre&s;s your&s;elf! What words you have! They go to my heart!&mdash;I don't know how it is: But every day I reverence more and more my guardian: <HI>Reverence!</HI> Yes, that is the proper word! I thank you for it! <HI>Filial reverence!</HI> Ju&s;t the thing! And let me &s;ay, that I never re|verenced him &s;o much as now, that I &s;ee what a po|lite, what a kind, what an affectionate hu&s;band he makes my dear Lady Grandi&s;on. Yet, let me tell you truth, madam, I &s;hould, I am afraid, be &s;uch a little-minded poor creature, that if I were married, and had not a hu&s;band that was very like him, I &s;hould envy you. I &s;hould be at lea&s;t unhappy.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="69">
If you could be <HI>envious,</HI> my dear, you would be unhappy: But you mu&s;t never encourage the addre&s;&s;es of a man, who you think loves you not better than any other woman: Who is not a good man upon principle: Who is not a man of &s;en&s;e: and that has &s;een &s;omething of the world.</P>
<P>And where, madam, can &s;uch a man be found?</P>
<P>Leave it to your guardian, my dear. He if any|body, will find you a man that you may be happy with, if your eye be not aforehand with your judg|ment.</P>
<P>That, madam, I hope it will not be: Fir&s;t, be|cau&s;e the reverence I have for my guardian, and his great qualities, will make all other men look little in my eye; and next, as I have &s;uch a confidence in his judgment, that if he points his finger, and &s;ays, That's the man, Emily! I will endeavour to like him. But I believe I never now &s;hall like any man on earth.</P>
<P>It is early days, my Love; but is there not &s;ome one man, that, were you of age to marry, you would think better of than of any other?</P>
<P>I don't know what to &s;ay to that. It is early days, as you &s;ay. I am but a girl. But girls have thoughts. I will tell you, madam, that the man who has pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome years in the company of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on; who is beloved by him, on proof, on expe|rience (as I may &s;ay) of his good heart&mdash;She &s;topt.</P>
<P>Beauchamp, my dear?</P>
<P>Why yes Him, I mean: He is the mo&s;t to be liked of any man but my guardian: But he now is a great man; and I &s;uppo&s;e may have &s;een the wo|man he could love.</P>
<P>I fan&s;y not, my dear.</P>
<P>Why do you fan&s;y not, madam?</P>
<P>Becau&s;e, if I mu&s;t &s;peak as freely to you, as I would have you do always to me, I think he &s;hews great and uncommon re&s;pect to you, tho' you are &s;o young a creature.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="70">
That's for my guardian's &s;ake: But be that as it will; let me be &s;ecure of my guardian's Love and yours, and I &s;hall have nothing to wi&s;h for.</P>
<P>Her guardian, <HI>my</HI> guardian, my friend, my Lover, my HUSBAND, every &s;weet word is one, coming in, put an end to the &s;ubject. I leave this conver&s;ation to your own reflexions, my dear grandmamma, Lady L. Lady G. But I have hopes from it.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XIII.</HI> Lady <HI>GRANDISON.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Saturday, Sunday, Jan. <HI>20, 21.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>ANOTHER long &s;ilence. Lucy will &s;upply all my defects. She will tell you how much I have been engaged. She has &s;ent you a charming Letter, filled with ob&s;ervations on the good order e&s;tabli&s;hed here before our arrival by Dr. Bartlett and Mrs. Cur|zon; with accounts of &s;ome particular charities, both public and private, that de&s;erve to be imitated by all who have ability; and of our vi&s;it made la&s;t Wed|ne&s;day at Mansfield-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The Lady of it would not part with us, till Thur&s;|day, the days being &s;hort, and the weather unfavour|able Mr. Dob&s;on and his Lady were gue&s;ts there. He is a credit to his cloath; his wife to him. They are greatly beloved by all who know them. Lady Mansfield and Mi&s;s Mansfield are all that is polite and good. The three brothers were there. The elde&s;t, who was once a melancholy man, is now one of the chearfulle&s;t. With what plea&s;ure did I meditate, as I looked upon them, the re&s;toration of &s;uch a worthy and antient family to affluence! They were born to it: Yet when they were deprived of it, how glorious was the re&s;ignation of mother and daughters! And now, how ea&s;y &s;its the pro&s;perity upon them! Never &s;aw I eyes more expre&s;&s;ive of gratitude to a benefactor,
<PB N="70" REF="71">
than tho&s;e both of Ladies and Gentlemen, as they were often ca&s;t upon my dear Sir Charles.</P>
<P>I heartily wi&s;h Mr. Orme may find his expecta|tions an&s;wered in the &s;econd voyage Nancy tells me he is preparing for to Li&s;bon. She will make known my be&s;t wi&s;hes for the re&s;toration of his health. How good is his &s;i&s;ter to accompany him!&mdash;I always loved her.</P>
<P>I received ye&s;terday yours, madam, acquainting me with Mr. Greville's vi&s;it and propo&s;al, and a&s;king my opinion of the latter; and whether I would choo&s;e to mention it to Lucy and my aunt. What can I &s;ay? You once told me, madam, that you believed Lucy would not have refu&s;ed Mr. Greville, had he fir&s;t applied to her. Lucy's grandmother, you &s;ay, is not aver&s;e to the match; and you think my uncle would not refu&s;e his con&s;ent, becau&s;e of the conti|guity of their re&s;pective e&s;tates, and in hopes, that he might re&s;ume with &s;ucce&s;s, on &s;uch an event, his fa|vourite project of exchange of lands. Yet I am &s;ure this con&s;ideration would have no weight with him, if he thought Lucy could not be happy with Mr. Gre|ville.</P>
<P>I have mentioned it to my aunt. She &s;ays, Mr. Greville is not a ba&s;hful man. He knows how to apply to Lucy him&s;elf. And &s;he has no notion, in <HI>&s;uch</HI> a ca&s;e, of that pride which with-holds him till he thinks him&s;elf &s;ure of the family-intere&s;t.</P>
<P>He will, if po&s;&s;ible, he &s;ays, be related to <HI>me:</HI> Let that be mentioned to Lucy, as one of his principal motives, and his bu&s;ine&s;s with her is done for ever.</P>
<P>Lady G. would laugh at the notion of a difficulty from a fir&s;t Love. Fir&s;t Love &s;he calls fir&s;t non&s;en&s;e. Too frequently it is &s;o. Lucy is a noble girl. She has overcome a fir&s;t attachment; the more laudably, as it co&s;t her &s;ome &s;truggles to do it. Mr. Greville, I doubt, has had &s;everal fir&s;t Loves: This tran&s;ition, therefore, is nothing to him. So neither of them
<PB N="71" REF="72">
will be fir&s;t Love to the other. It may therefore be a match of di&s;cretion. Yet his character! The re|formation he boa&s;ts of!&mdash;I <HI>hope</HI> he is reformed: But I have no notion of a good young woman, as Lucy is, tru&s;ting her per&s;on, I may &s;ay her <HI>principles,</HI> to the arbitrary will of an impetuous man, who has been an a vowed Libertine, and pretend not to have reformed from proper convictions. A &s;coffer too! How came he by his new Lights?&mdash;You, madam, have told <HI>us</HI> young folks the difficulty of overcoming evil habits. I own that Lucy alway &s;poke of him with more faviour than any-body el&s;e. She was inclined to think him a good-natured man; and was plea&s;ed with what &s;he called humour in him. <HI>Humour!</HI> I never could call it &s;o. Humour, I u&s;ed to tell her, is a gentle, a decent, tho' a lively thing. Mr. Greville is boi&s;terous, impetuous, <HI>rude,</HI> I had almo&s;t &s;aid: His court&s;hip to me was either rant, or affront; the one to &s;hew his Plain-dealing, the other his Love. He knows not what re&s;pectful Love is. In &s;hort, his mirth, his good-nature, as it is called, has fiercene&s;s in it; it always gave me apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>As to worldly matters, there can be no exception to him: But I cannot be of the opinion of Lucy's grandmother, that he is a generous man. He has only qualities that look <HI>like</HI> genero&s;ity. His &s;tart to me, when he <HI>re&s;igned</HI> his preten&s;ions to me, as they have been called (for I know not any he had) was <HI>only</HI> a &s;tart. He could not hold it. But be all the&s;e things as they may, how can I, who love Lucy as my&s;elf, propo&s;e to the dear girl a man, whom I could not think of for my&s;elf? Lucy has a fine fortune, and &s;urely there are men enow in the world, who have never made preten&s;ions to Lucy's cou&s;in, who would think them&s;elves honoured by her acceptance; otherwi&s;e, I &s;hould, after Sir Rowland's hint, and earne&s;t wi&s;hes in his nephew's favour, much &s;ooner recommend Mr. Fowler to her than Mr. Greville.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="73">
MY aunt had &s;aid, that, for her part, &s;he &s;hould choo&s;e to leave the above affair to its own workings: Yet could not forbear to acquaint Lucy with it. The dear girl came to me, to demand a &s;ight of your Letter, and of what I had written upon it. I could not (tho' I had &s;ome little reluctance to &s;hew her the latter) deny her. I will give you, madam, the &s;ub&s;tance of a &s;hort dialogue that pa&s;&s;ed between us on the occa&s;ion; and leave it to you to draw &s;uch conclu&s;ions from it, as you &s;hall judge proper, with re|gard to my Lucy's inclinations.</P>
<P>She did not know what I meant, &s;he &s;aid, by write|ing to you, that &s;he had always &s;poken of Mr. Greville with more favour than any-body el&s;e.</P>
<P>It is ungenerous, Lucy, if you are angry at what you would oblige me to &s;hew you again&s;t my will.</P>
<P>I am <HI>not</HI> angry. But&mdash;She &s;topt, and would not explain her half &s;ullen BUT. O Lucy, thought I, you are a woman, my dear!</P>
<P>As to what you write, &s;aid &s;he, of his de&s;ire of be|ing related to <HI>you;</HI> who would not?&mdash;If that be not his <HI>principal</HI> motive&mdash;Very well, Lucy! thought I.</P>
<P>I know, &s;aid &s;he, that my grandmamma Selby has often wi&s;hed Mr. Greville would make his addre&s;&s;es to her grand-daughter!&mdash;So! So! So! Lucy, thought I.</P>
<P>His Libertini&s;m indeed is an objection&mdash;But I have not heard <HI>lately</HI> of any enormities&mdash;</P>
<P>Go on, Lucy, thought I: Hitherto appears not any rea&s;on for Mr. Greville to de&s;pair.</P>
<P>He may have &s;een his folly.</P>
<P>No doubt but he has! thought I. He <HI>&s;aw</HI> it all the time he was committing it: But, perhaps, he is the more determined bad man for that. Is not purity of heart, thought I, as well as of manners, an eligible thing?</P>
<P>If a woman is not to marry till &s;he meet with a &s;trictly virtuous man&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="74">
You have too often pleaded that argument, Lucy, to me&mdash;I am &s;orry&mdash;I &s;topt; willing to hear her quite out; for &s;he held before her what I had written.</P>
<P>How came he, you a&s;k, &s;aid &s;he, by his new lights? I have nothing to do with how he came by them. I &s;hould rather indeed he had them from <HI>pro|per</HI> convictions&mdash;But if he has them, that's enough.</P>
<P>Is it, my dear, let him have been what he will?</P>
<P>I am for judging charitably&mdash;</P>
<P>Charming! thought I&mdash;judging charitably! So I have lo&s;t a virtue, and you, Lucy, have found it&punc;</P>
<P>Mr. Greville is nothing to me: Nor ever will be.</P>
<P>Not quite &s;o &s;ure of that, thought I to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>You &s;ay, Harriet, you have no notion of a good young woman, tru&s;ting her <HI>principles</HI> to the arbitrary will of a man who has been a free Liver&mdash;<HI>Mu&s;t</HI> the man be arbitrary?&mdash;Were a hu&s;band a free Liver, mu&s;t a wife's own principles be endangered?</P>
<P><HI>The&s;e</HI> que&s;tions from my Lucy! thought I.</P>
<P>A &s;coffer, you &s;ay, Harriet!&mdash;The man's a fool for that!&mdash;But what a poor &s;oul mu&s;t &s;he be that could not &s;ilence a &s;coffer!</P>
<P>Silence a &s;coffer! Ah Lucy! &s;aid I: And would you marry a man with a hope to be able to &s;ilence him? Mr. Greville is a conceited man: My Lucy has &s;ix times his &s;en&s;e; but he will not be convinced of that. You will have the le&s;s influence upon him, if he is jealous of the &s;uperiority of your under&s;tanding. Mr. Gre|ville is ob&s;tinate as well as conceited. Few men, I be|lieve, will own conviction from a wife's arguments.</P>
<P>To be &s;ure the man is not a Sir Charles Grandi&s;on. Who <HI>is?</HI>&mdash;Let him, as my aunt Selby &s;ays, apply to me; I &s;hall give him his an&s;wer.</P>
<P>You would wi&s;h he &s;hould, Lucy?</P>
<P>I don't &s;ay &s;o.</P>
<P>I fancy, Lucy, you would not be very <HI>cruel</HI> if he did.</P>
<P>You <HI>fancy</HI> I would not&mdash;But I can, as <HI>you</HI> always
<PB N="74" REF="75">
did, treat the man who profe&s;&s;es to love me, with civility, yet not throw my&s;elf into his arms at the fir&s;t word&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t</HI> word, Lucy! No! The &s;econd, or third, or fourth, is time enough; &s;o the man is not mean time rendered quite hopele&s;s.</P>
<P>Very well, Lady Grandi&s;on: But let me go on with what you have written&mdash;<HI>Good-natured man!</HI>&mdash;I do think he is not an <HI>ill-natured</HI> man.</P>
<P>So much the better for him&s;elf, and his future wife, Lucy.</P>
<P>That will not be I, Lady Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>Perhaps not, Lucy.</P>
<P>&mdash;<HI>Humour!</HI> I do think he is a humorous good-natured man. A little too vehement perhaps in his mirth; a little too frolic: But who is faultle&s;s?</P>
<P>Proceed, my Lucy.</P>
<P>&mdash;<HI>Generous!</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Not a generous man!&mdash;"Quali|ties that look <HI>like</HI> generous ones."</Q>&mdash;You are a nice di&s;tingui&s;her, Harriet; you always were&mdash;But here you tell your grandmamma, that you had rather I &s;hould have Mr. Fowler than Mr. Greville&mdash;</P>
<P>Well, my dear, and what &s;ay you to that?</P>
<P>Why, I &s;ay, I think you are not &s;o nice for me, in this ca&s;e, as you are in others.</P>
<P>How &s;o?</P>
<P><HI>How &s;o!</HI> Why is there not a difference between the actual propo&s;als made by Mr. Greville to Mrs. Shirley; and Sir Rowland's undertaking to <HI>try</HI> to <HI>prevail</HI> upon Mr. Fowler to make his addre&s;&s;es to me?</P>
<P>Granted, my dear!&mdash;I have not a word more to &s;ay in behalf of Mr. Fowler. Mr. Greville, Lucy&mdash;</P>
<P>Is a man I never will have&mdash;</P>
<P>No ra&s;h re&s;olutions, my dear. And yet I believe a woman has &s;een the &s;ame man in a very different light, when he has offered him&s;elf to her acceptance, from what &s;he did before.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="76">
I believe &s;o&mdash;But I had a mind to &s;ound you, Har|riet; and to come at your opinion&mdash;</P>
<P>You were intitled to it, Lucy, without attempting to &s;ound me for it.</P>
<P>True! But we women &s;ometimes choo&s;e to come at a point, by the <HI>roundabouts,</HI> rather than by the <HI>forerights.</HI></P>
<P>That is, Lucy, either when we think the <HI>foreright</HI> way, as you call it, would not an&s;wer our wi&s;hes; or when we are not willing to open our own hearts.</P>
<P>Your &s;ervant, my dear: But the cap fits not. Whenever I &s;peak to you, my heart is upon my Lips.</P>
<P>Let me try then, in this one doubtful in&s;tance, that I ever had from you of its being &s;o. Do you think of encouraging Mr. Greville's propo&s;al?</P>
<P>It is not a propo&s;al, till it comes in a direct way to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Very well, my dear&mdash;I &s;ay no more till it does.</P>
<P>SIR Charles has ju&s;t now heard that Mr. Lowther, is arrived in London. He longs (&s;o I am &s;ure do I) to know, how affairs are &s;ituated in Italy. O for good news from thence! Then will my happine&s;s in this Life be perfected.</P>

<P>MR. Lowther arrived here la&s;t night. Sir Charles gave him a mo&s;t welcome reception. He pre|&s;ented him to all our gue&s;ts, with expre&s;&s;ions of the warme&s;t friend&s;hip; and then retired with him to his Study. He &s;oon led him back to company, and &s;eat|ing him, drew a chair between my aunt, and me&mdash;You mu&s;t have curio&s;ity, my deare&s;t Love, &s;aid he.
<PB N="76" REF="77">
Behold the &s;i&s;ter-excellence of Lady Clementina, Mr. Lowther! Not a per&s;on of her family is more concerned for the happine&s;s of that Lady, than this deare&s;t and mo&s;t generous of women. Every one of my friends pre&s;ent (looking round him) is an admirer of her&mdash;We cannot my dear (applying to me) know for certainty, the de&s;tiny of that excellent Lady from Mr. Lowther. He pa&s;&s;ed a week at Lyons, a fort|night at Paris, on his return to England. But my Jeronymo is in a fine way, thank God, and re&s;olves to vi&s;it us in the &s;pring.</P>
<P>I hope, Sir, &s;aid my aunt, to Mr. Lowther, you left Lady Clementina well and happy in her mind.</P>
<P>She was at Florence, an&s;wered he, when I left Italy. She has been pretty much indi&s;po&s;ed there. The General, the Bi&s;hop, and Father Mare&s;cotti, had been with her. She was expected at Bologna very &s;oon. By this time I have no doubt, &s;he is Counte&s;s of Belvedere.</P>
<P>By her own con&s;ent, I hope then, Mr. Lowther? &s;aid I eagerly.</P>
<P>He &s;hook his head&mdash;As to <HI>that,</HI> &s;aid he, &s;he has the mo&s;t indulgent of parents&mdash;</P>
<P>They cannot be &s;o, Mr. Lowther, if they would compel her to marry any man to whom &s;he has an in|difference.</P>
<P>They will not <HI>compel</HI> her, madam&mdash;</P>
<P>Per&s;ua&s;ion, Sir, in the circum&s;tances this excellent Lady is in, is compul&s;ion.</P>
<P>I think it may be ju&s;tly called &s;o, &s;aid Sir Charles. Mr. Lowther, they &s;hould not have been &s;o precipi|tating.</P>
<P>So you have always told them, Sir Charles. Signor Jeronymo is entirely of your opinion: Yet is earne&s;t in the Count of Belvedere's favour. The Count a|dores her.</P>
<P><HI>Adores her,</HI> Sir! &s;aid I. Adores <HI>him&s;elf!</HI> for &s;o it &s;hould be &s;aid (pardon me, Sir!) of a man who pre|fers
<PB N="77" REF="78">
not the happine&s;s of the object beloved, to his own. I felt my face glow.</P>
<P>Generous warmth! &s;aid Sir Charles&mdash;laying his hand on mine.</P>
<P>For my part, replied Mr. Lowther, I am only a|fraid of the return of her malady. If it do not return, and &s;he can be prevailed on, her piety will reconcile her to a duty&mdash;</P>
<P>A <HI>duty,</HI> Mr. Lowther, interrupted I&mdash;So impo&s;ed!&mdash;A <HI>duty!</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>I knew not what I &s;aid. I thought, at that in&s;tant, I did not like Mr. Lowther.</P>
<P>My uncle, aunt, and the re&s;t of us, thought Sir Charles and Mr. Lowther would be glad to be left alone; and retired early.</P>
<P>My aunt, my Lucy, and I, had a good deal of di&s;|cour&s;e upon this intere&s;ting &s;ubject; Emily pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>We all fore&s;aw, that the &s;ituation of this admirable Lady would overcloud a little (we hoped <HI>but</HI> a little) the happie&s;t days that ever mortals knew. The &s;in|cere value, &s;aid my aunt, that you have for &s;o de&s;erv|ing a woman, and your native genero&s;ity, will be your &s;ecurity for happine&s;s, my dear; and will &s;ix on a du|rable ba&s;e your mutual Love: But this Lady's trials will, however, be trials to you. God give her peace of mind! it is all we can hope for in <HI>her</HI> favour; To <HI>you,</HI> the continuance of your pre&s;ent happine&s;s: grea|ter, cannot fall to the lot of mortal.</P>
<P>She left me, I retired to my pen.</P>
<P>THUS far have I written. 'Tis late. Sir Charles is coming up&mdash;And I am here at my pen. I will com|pliment him with a place in my clo&s;et, while I retire.&mdash;Good-night, my deare&s;t grandmamma. Pray for your Harriet, and pray for Clementina.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Friday morning.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>SIR Charles would have withdrawn to his Study,
<PB N="78" REF="79">
when he found me at my pen. I be&s;ought him to &s;it down in my clo&s;et.</P>
<P>Remove your papers then, my dear.</P>
<P>No need, Sir, <HI>The&s;e</HI> (putting what I had been ju&s;t writing, and tho&s;e I had written the day before, on one &s;ide of my de&s;k) I would not, Sir, except you have a curio&s;ity, wi&s;h you to &s;ee at pre&s;ent: <HI>The&s;e,</HI> Sir, you may, if you plea&s;e, amu&s;e your&s;elf with.</P>
<P>I will take down one of your books, my Love. I will not look into any of your written papers.</P>
<P>Dear, generous Sir, look into them all&mdash;Look into both parcels. Something about Lucy; &s;omething of what Mr. Lowther has talked of, in that parcel&mdash;Read <HI>any</HI> of the written papers before you.</P>
<P>A generous mind, my Love, will not take all that is offered by a generous mind. Ha&s;ten, my Harriet: It is late. My mind is a little di&s;turbed: Yours, I am afraid, is generou&s;ly unea&s;y. In your faithful bo&s;om, will I repo&s;e all my cares.</P>
<P>I pre&s;&s;ed his hand between both mine, and would have pre&s;&s;ed it with my lips: But, ki&s;&s;ing my hands, fir&s;t one, then the other&mdash;Conde&s;cending goodne&s;s! &s;aid he. God continue to me my Harriet's Love, and make Clementina not unhappy, and what can be|fal me, that will not add thankfulne&s;s to thankful|ne&s;s?</P>
<P>With what &s;oothing tenderne&s;s did he afterwards open his generous heart to his Harriet! He was in|deed di&s;turbed: For Mr. Lowther had told him, that the General (I don't love him) was quite cruel&mdash;At one time he threatened the excellent creature: He called her ungenerous, ungrateful, undutiful!&mdash;She fell down at his &s;eet, in a fainting fit: He left her in anger&mdash;Staid not to recover or &s;ooth her&mdash;Yet re|turned in about two hours (his con&s;cience &s;tinging him) and on his knees be&s;ought her pardon&mdash;Received it&mdash;The dear &s;aint forgave the <HI>&s;oldierly</HI> man&mdash;Yet he per|&s;i&s;ted, and turned his threatenings into wor&s;e, if po&s;&s;ible, than threatenings, into per&s;ua&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="80">
If I have an enemy, &s;aid the dear creature to her brothers, who has conceived a mortal antipathy to me, let him in&s;inuate him&s;elf into the favour of tho&s;e mo&s;t dear to me, and prevail upon them to attack me with all the powers of per&s;uading Love, in order to induce me to do the thing, whatever it be, mo&s;t contrary to my heart: And then will the in&s;tigator wreak upon me his whole vengeance, and make me think death it&s;elf an eligible refuge.</P>
<P>Sir Charles &s;ighed at repeating this. I wept. How happy, thought I, more than once, are you, be&s;t of men, in your own reflections, that a woman &s;o ex|cellent, who cannot be happy with any other man, <HI>her&s;elf</HI> refu&s;ed you, and <HI>per&s;i&s;ted</HI> in her refu&s;al; though you &s;ought all ways, and u&s;ed all arguments, to bring her to a change of determination! What otherwi&s;e would have been your regret! And how unhappy &s;hould I have been in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of be|ing in her place; and of having di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her of a heart to which &s;he had &s;o much better preten&s;ions! Now has he no room for remor&s;e; but for friendly pity only, and for wi&s;hes to relieve her afflicted heart. Of what a ble&s;&s;ing is that man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, who, when calamity a&s;&s;ails him, can acquit him&s;elf, his <HI>inten|tions</HI> at lea&s;t; and &s;ay, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This I have not brought upon my&s;elf: It is an inevitable evil: A di&s;pen|&s;ation of Providence, I will call it, and &s;ubmit to it, as &s;uch!"</Q></P>
<P>Methinks, madam, I could &s;pare this excellent woman &s;ome of my happine&s;s. Have I not more than mortal ever knew before?</P>
<P>Sir Charles mentioned to me, that Lady Olivia, in her la&s;t Letter to him, intimated her de&s;ire to come over once more to England: But he hoped what he had written to di&s;&s;uade her from it, would have weight with her. I told him, I wi&s;hed that Lady the wife of &s;ome worthy man, who&s;e gratitude and affection &s;he, by her great fortune, might en|gage.
<PB N="80" REF="81">
But, Sir, &s;aid I, I cannot, cannot wi&s;h (be the Count of Belvedere ever &s;o good a man) that La|dy Clementina were married.</P>
<P>What would my Harriet wi&s;h for Lady Clementina, circum&s;tanced as &s;he is?</P>
<P>I don't know. But the woman who has loved Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, with a heart &s;o pure, can never be happy with any other man.</P>
<P>You are ever obliging, my Love. You judge of Clementina as &s;he de&s;erves to be judged of, as to the purity of her heart. But&mdash;He &s;topt.</P>
<P>But what, my dear Sir?&mdash;Alas! &s;he &s;ays that you have &s;trengthened the hands of her friends: Am I forgiven before I go any further?</P>
<P>Not, my Harriet, if you think it nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;k &s;uch a que&s;tion. Blame me always, when you think me wrong: I &s;hall doubt your Love, if you give me rea&s;on to que&s;tion your freedom.</P>
<P>Dear Sir,&mdash;But an&s;wer me: Would <HI>you</HI> have Cle|mentina, circum&s;tanced as &s;he is, marry?</P>
<P>What an&s;wer can I return to my Harriet's que&s;tion; when &s;ometimes I am ready to favour the parents pleas; at others, the daughter's? I would not have her either compelled, or over-earne&s;tly per&s;uaded, The family plead, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That their happine&s;s, her health and peace, depend on her marriage: They cannot bear to think of rewarding Laurana for her cruel|ty, with an e&s;tate that never was de&s;igned for her; and to the cutting it off, as it may happen, from their Giacomo and his de&s;cendants for ever, in ca&s;e Clementina a&s;&s;umes the veil. The health&punc; of the father and mother are declining: They wi&s;h but to live to &s;ee the alliance with the Count of Belvedere take place. The noble Lady gave rea&s;ons that <HI>could</HI> be an&s;wered. She had, by her own magnanimity, got over a greater difficulty, if I may pre&s;ume to &s;ay &s;o, than they had required her to &s;truggle with; how could I avoid advi&s;ing her to yield to the &s;upplica|tions
<PB N="81" REF="82">
of parents, of brothers, of an uncle, who, however mi&s;taken in the means by which they &s;eek to obtain their wi&s;hes, love not their own &s;ouls, better than they love their Clementina?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It was, be&s;ides, a mea&s;ure by which only at the time, I could demon&s;trate (and the General, I know, con&s;idered it as a <HI>te&s;t)</HI> that I really gave up all hopes of her my&s;elf.&mdash;And when I had owned, that there was a woman, with whom I had no doubt of being happy, could I engage her to ac|cept of me, they all be&s;ought me, for <HI>their</HI> &s;akes, for <HI>Clementina</HI>'s, to court that acceptance, having hopes, that tho' &s;he could not &s;et me an example, &s;he would <HI>follow</HI> mine."</Q></P>
<P>This, my deare&s;t Life, was the occa&s;ion, as I told your friends, of accelerating my declaration to you. I could not el&s;e, either for the &s;ake of <HI>your</HI> delicacy or my own, <HI>&s;o &s;oon</HI> have made propo&s;als, not even to Mrs. Shirley; for, &s;ituated as I was, I could not think of applying to you till I had &s;trengthened my&s;elf, as I hoped to do, by her intere&s;t. Your generous ac|ceptance, &s;ignified to me by that good Lady, has for ever obliged me. I regarded it, my Harriet, circum|&s;tanced as I had been, and &s;hall ever regard it, as a <HI>conde&s;cen&s;ion,</HI> which, as I told that Lady, <HI>at the time,</HI> laid me under an obligation that I never, by my ut|mo&s;t gratitude, &s;hall be able to repay.</P>
<P>O Sir, well have you &s;hewn that you meant what you &s;aid. How poor a return, hiding my face in his generous bo&s;om, is my Love for &s;o much goodne&s;s, and kind con&s;ideration!</P>
<P>He cla&s;ped me to the faithfulle&s;t of human hearts.</P>
<P>But, dear Sir, I find, I find, on the whole, that you think Lady Clementina has not &s;o much rea&s;on on <HI>her</HI> &s;ide, as her parents have on <HI>theirs.</HI></P>
<P>My tenderne&s;s for her, my dear, becau&s;e of her un|happy malady, and my apprehen&s;ion of a return of it, together with my admiration of her noble quali|ties,
<PB N="82" REF="83">
prejudice me &s;trongly in her favour. If &s;he <HI>could</HI> be convinced by their motives, I &s;hould be ready to own my convictions in favour of the&s;e. But if <HI>&s;he</HI> cannot, neither can <HI>I;</HI> &s;o partial am I in the cau&s;e of a Lady I &s;o &s;incerely admire, and who has been &s;o much afflicted. But what, in the &s;ituation they and &s;he were in, remain for me to do, but to advi&s;e the family to proceed with tenderne&s;s and patience; that their Clementina might have time to weigh, to con|&s;ider, their rea&s;ons, their indulgence? You, my dear, &s;hall &s;ee in the copies of the Letters I have written &s;ince I have been in England, my remon&s;tran|ces to them on their precipitating her. But they were in a train: They pre&s;umed on the characteri&s;tic duty of their Clementina: They flattered them&s;elves, that &s;ometimes &s;he &s;eemed to relent: They conceiv|ed hopes from the expre&s;&s;ions of compa&s;&s;ion for the Count of Belvedere, which &s;ometimes &s;he let fall. The General, who, though a generous man, can do nothing moderately, would not be &s;atisfied with <HI>cold</HI> mea&s;ures, as he called them; and, not doubting his &s;i&s;ter's acquie&s;cence with her duty, if once &s;he could be prevailed upon to think her compliance &s;uch, they were re&s;olved to pur&s;ue the train they were in: But in order to avoid their importunities, how has the dear Clementina &s;hifted the &s;cene from Bologna to Flo|rence from Florence to Bologna, and once, for that pur|po&s;e wanted to go to Urbino, once to Naples, and e|ven, as you have &s;een, to come to England!&mdash;But now, by this time, mo&s;t probably, they have &s;ucceed|ed. God give happine&s;s to the dear Clementina!</P>
<P>Mo&s;t cordially did I join in the prayer.</P>
<P>The next Letters from Italy mu&s;t acquaint us with the unwi&s;hed-for &s;ucce&s;s of the family; and the poor Lady's thraldom. Can, my dear grandmamma, the Count of Belvedere really be a good, a generous man, to &s;olicit the favour of a <HI>hand,</HI> that he knows will not

<P>EMILY and I have had another conver&s;ation. She had been more grave and &s;olemn than u&s;ual from the time of the la&s;t, of which I gave you an ac|count.</P>
<P>Her Anne had taken notice to Sally of a change in the temper of her young mi&s;tre&s;s. She knew not how to plea&s;e her, &s;he &s;aid. From the be&s;t-natured young Lady in the world, &s;he was grown one of the mo&s;t peevi&s;h; and &s;he had taken the Liberty to tell her, that &s;he mu&s;t quit her &s;ervice, if &s;he found her &s;o hard to be plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Do then, was her an&s;wer; I won't be threatened by you, Anne. You &s;eem to have found out your
<PB N="84" REF="85">
con&s;equence with me. Go, Anne, as &s;oon as you will. I won't be threatened, Anne. I have enough to vex me, without being di&s;turbed by you.</P>
<P>The hone&s;t maid, who dearly loves her, and has been with her ever &s;ince &s;he was &s;even years old, and was much approved for her fidelity and good behavi|our by her father, bur&s;t out into tears, and would, in a mild and humble manner, have expo&s;tulated with her. Let me be&s;eech you, madam, &s;aid &s;he, to per|mit me a word or two by way of dutiful expo&s;tulation. But &s;he hurried from her&mdash;I won't hear you, Anne. You have begun at the wrong end. You &s;hould have expo&s;tulated, and not threatened, fir&s;t. And then going up to her clo&s;et. She locked her&s;elf in.</P>
<P>I pitied the dear girl. Too well I thought I could account for this change of temper in her: So exceed|ing good her guardian to her, her gratitude augment|ed her Love [Don't I know how that might ea&s;ily be?]: Yet, thought I, it would half break her heart, if he were to a&s;&s;ume re&s;erve&mdash;I would not for her &s;ake have him imagine there was a nece&s;&s;ity for a change of his behaviour to her. And indeed if he were to be more re&s;erved, what would that do? So good a man; &s;o uniform his goodne&s;s; the poor Emily mu&s;t ac|quit him, and condemn her&s;elf; yet have no cure for her malady.</P>
<P>Sally offered Anne to acquaint me with what had pa&s;&s;ed: But the good young woman begged &s;he would not. Her young Lady was &s;o tenacious, &s;he &s;aid (young Lady like) of her authority, that &s;he would never forgive her if &s;he were known to make an ap|peal to me, or to my aunt. And to complain with|out a probability of redre&s;s, the prudent creature ob|&s;erved, except to her, as one Lady's woman to ano|ther, would expo&s;e her beloved young mi&s;tre&s;s; when, perhaps, the pre&s;ent grievance might be cured by time, a&s;&s;iduity, and patience.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="86">
This was nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, my Uncle, and Mr. Deane, having rode out pretty early this morning to breakfa&s;t, at Sir William Turner's; and my aunt and Lucy retiring after breakfa&s;t to write; and I to my clo&s;et for the &s;ame purpo&s;e; Emily came and tapped at my door. I in&s;tantly opened it.</P>
<P>I intrude, madam.&mdash;No, my dear.</P>
<P>I had ob&s;erved at &s;upper la&s;t night, and at breakfa&s;t this morning, that &s;he had been in tears; tho' nobo|dy el&s;e did; for the above hints, privately given me by Sally, made me more ob&s;ervant of her motions.</P>
<P>I took her hand, and would have placed her by me&mdash;No, madam, &s;aid &s;he, let me &s;tand: I am not worthy of &s;itting down in your pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Her eyes were brimful of tears; but as &s;he twinkled in hopes to di&s;per&s;e them, I would not take &s;uch full notice of them, as might make them run over, if they could be di&s;per&s;ed: Yet mine, I believe gli&s;tened &s;ympathetically.</P>
<P><HI>In my pre&s;ence,</HI> my Emily! my friend! Why, why, this?</P>
<P>I &s;tood up. Your elder &s;i&s;ter, my Love, &s;its not, while her younger &s;tands.</P>
<P>She threw her arms about me, and her tears ran over. This goodne&s;s, this goodne&s;s kills me!&mdash;I am, I am, a mo&s;t unhappy creature!&mdash;Unhappy from the grant of my own wi&s;hes!&mdash;O that you would treat me &s;everely! I cannot, cannot &s;upport my&s;elf, under the hourly in&s;tances which I receive of your good|ne&s;s!</P>
<P>Whence, my deare&s;t Emily, the&s;e acknowlege|ments? I do love my Emily: And &s;hould be either ungrateful or in&s;en&s;ible to the merits of my beloved Si&s;ter, did I not do all in my power to make her hap|py. What can I do for her, that is not her due?</P>
<P>She &s;truggled her&s;elf out of my embracing arms, withdrawing hers&mdash;Let me, let me go, madam!&mdash;
<PB N="86" REF="87">
She hurried into the adjoining apartment. I follow|ed her; and taking her hand, Leave me not, in this perplexity, my Emily! I cannot, part with you: If you love your Harriet, as &s;he loves her Emily, you will put me in the way of alleviating this angui&s;h of the mo&s;t innocent, and mo&s;t amiable of minds. Open your heart to me, my dear.</P>
<P>O Lady Grandi&s;on! the de&s;erving wife of the be&s;t of men, you ought to hate me!</P>
<P>My <HI>deare&s;t</HI> Emily! &s;aid I.</P>
<P>Indeed you ought.</P>
<P>Let us &s;it down on this Sofa, if you will not return to my clo&s;et.</P>
<P>I &s;at down. She &s;at by me, leaning her glowing face on my &s;houlder. I put one arm round her neck; with the other hand, I gra&s;ped one of hers. Now, my dear, I conjure you, by the friend&s;hip that is be|tween us, the <HI>more</HI> than &s;i&s;terly friend&s;hip, open your whole heart to me; and renounce me, if it be in my power to heal the wounds of your mind, and I do not pour into them the balm of friendly Love.</P>
<P>What can I &s;ay?&mdash;Ye&s;terday, my deare&s;t Lady Grandi&s;on, I received an an&s;wer to a ca&s;e I put to Dr. Bartlett, of a young creature, who&mdash;I <HI>can't</HI> tell you&mdash;</P>
<P>She wept; rai&s;ed her head; dried her eyes; again leaned her face on my &s;houlder; again I put my arm round her neck&mdash;Your ca&s;e, my Love?</P>
<P>Ah, madam! <HI>My</HI> ca&s;e&mdash;Did you &s;ay, <HI>My</HI> ca&s;e?</P>
<P>I a&s;ked, my dear, not as for <HI>your</HI> ca&s;e, any other than as for the ca&s;e you put to the Doctor.</P>
<P>He has not told you&punc; madam?</P>
<P>Indeed he has not &s;aid a word of your con&s;ulting him.</P>
<P>I had rather tell you my&s;elf. I am afraid he gue&s;&s;es who the young woman is. O the poor cunning!&mdash;I am a weak &s;illy creature!&mdash;He certainly gue&s;&s;es&mdash;</P>
<P>May I, my Love, &s;ee the ca&s;e?&mdash;May I &s;ee the an&s;wer to it?</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="88">
I have burnt them both!&mdash;In a fit of anger at my|&s;elf, that I &s;hould expo&s;e my&s;elf (for he certainly gue&s;&s;es who the young woman is) I threw them in the fire.</P>
<P>But you can <HI>tell</HI> me the ca&s;e. You can give me the &s;ub&s;tance of the an&s;wer.</P>
<P>How can I? <HI>You</HI> of all women! <HI>You,</HI> madam, whom I be&s;t love of all women; but who ought to hate, to de&s;pi&s;e me!</P>
<P>Tru&s;t me, Love, with your &s;ecret. It &s;hall never without your Leave pa&s;s this faithful bo&s;om, if it be a &s;ecret that <HI>already</HI> I do not gue&s;s at.</P>
<P>She &s;tarted&mdash;Gue&s;s at, madam!</P>
<P>Don't &s;tart at what I &s;ay, my Love.</P>
<P>O you cannot, cannot gue&s;s at it. If you did&mdash;</P>
<P>What if I did?</P>
<P>Then would you bani&s;h from your pre&s;ence for e|ver the ju&s;tly hated Emily: Then would you make my guardian renounce me!</P>
<P>Shall I, my dear, <HI>tell</HI> you what I gue&s;s?</P>
<P>Whi&s;per me then, throwing about me the hand I held not: But whi&s;per me that I may not hear.</P>
<P>You <HI>love</HI> your guardian, my Emily!&mdash;He loves you!</P>
<P>O madam!</P>
<P>He will always love you; &s;o will I.</P>
<P>Bani&s;h the criminal from your pre&s;ence for ever; ri&s;ing; yet again laying her face on my &s;houlder&mdash;and cla&s;ping her arms about me, Hide me, hide me from my&s;elf.</P>
<P>No need, my dear Every-body loves your guar|dian. You cannot love him but with innocence. Your Love is founded in gratitude. So was mine. Don't I know how to allow for my Emily?</P>
<P>You will bani&s;h fear from my heart, madam, by this your goodne&s;s to me. I find I may own all my weakne&s;s, my folly, to you; and the rather, as I &s;hall intitle my&s;elf by it to your advice. I wanted to do
<PB N="88" REF="89">
it; but was afraid you would hate me. In the &s;ame circum&s;tances I doubt I &s;hould not be &s;o generous as you are. O that I had not put my ca&s;e to the Doctor!</P>
<P>The Doctor, my dear, is all goodne&s;s. He will keep your &s;ecret&mdash;</P>
<P>And not tell my guardian, madam&punc; any thing a|bout it? It would be wor&s;e than death to me, if my guardian &s;hould mi&s;tru&s;t me. <HI>He</HI> would hate the poor Emily, if <HI>you</HI> did not.</P>
<P>He never &s;hall know it, my dear. You have already engaged the Doctor to &s;ecrecy, I doubt not.</P>
<P>I have.</P>
<P>He will inviolably keep your &s;ecret, no fear; e&s;pe|cially as your charming ingenuou&s;ne&s;s to me, will be a means of putting you and me, my Love, on finding expedients, that &s;hall equally &s;ecure your honour, and your guardian's regard for you.</P>
<P>That, madam, is the very thing.</P>
<P>Open then to me your innocent heart, my dear. Regard me, as your friend, your &s;i&s;ter, and as if I were not the happy wife of your beloved guardian&mdash;</P>
<P>And &s;o I will.&mdash;I did not, madam, mi&s;tru&s;t my&s;elf till the &s;olemnity had pa&s;&s;ed, that made you and my guardian one. Then I began to be unea&s;y with my|&s;elf; and the more, as I was for hiding my&s;elf from my&s;elf, as I may &s;ay; for I was afraid of looking into my heart: Why &s;o? thought I. Am I not an inno|cent girl? What do I wi&s;h for? What can I hope for? Do I not love Lady Grandi&s;on? I do. Yet now-and-then&mdash;Don't hate me, madam! I will reveal to you all my heart, and all my weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>Proceed, my Emily. This is indeed a token of your love, of your confidence in me. What a com|pliment does my deare&s;t younger &s;i&s;ter make to her elder.</P>
<P>Yet now-and-then, &s;omething like Envy, I thought, aro&s;e in my heart: And can your countenance for|bear to change, when I tell you of Envy?</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="90">
If it did, it would be from compa&s;&s;ionate Love to my Emily. You don't know, my dear, how my heart dilates on this your mo&s;t agreeable confidence in me.</P>
<P>God ble&s;s that dear heart!&mdash;There never was &s;uch a heart as yours. Well, but I will go on if you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Do, my dear.</P>
<P>Here, thought I, once (that I was re&s;olved to call my&s;elf to account) did I a&s;k the favour of being allow|ed to live with my guardian and his Lady, when they were married: And what did I mean by it? Nothing but innocence, believe me. Well, and my reque&s;t is granted! This was all that I thought was wanting to make me happy: But, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, am I hap|py? No. Do I love my guardian le&s;s? No. Do I love Lady Grandi&s;on more for granting me this fa|vour? I <HI>admire</HI> her more, I think; and I have a grateful &s;en&s;e of her goodne&s;s to me: But, I don't know how it is&mdash;I think, tho' I dearly love her, yet I would be &s;ometimes glad I did not, quite &s;o well. Ungrateful Emily! And &s;everely I took my&s;elf to ta&s;k. Surely, pity, madam, is near akin to Love; for while your &s;u&s;pen&s;es la&s;ted, I thought I loved you bet|ter than I loved my own heart: But when you were happy, and there was no room for pity, wicked wretch that I was! I wanted, methought, &s;ometimes to lower you.&mdash;Don't you hate me now?</P>
<P>No, no, my Emily; my Pity, as you &s;ay, increa&s;es my Love of you. Proceed, child, your mind is the un&s;ullied book of nature: Turn to another Leaf. De|pend upon my kinde&s;t allowances. I knew, before you knew it your&s;elf, that you loved your guardian.</P>
<P>Before I knew it my&s;elf! Why that might be. So I went on rea&s;oning with my&s;elf&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What, Emily, can&s;t thou love thy guardian more; and Lady Grandi&s;on, with all her goodne&s;s to me, not more&mdash;And can&s;t thou mingle envy with admiration of
<PB N="90" REF="91">
her?&mdash;Ah, &s;illy, and wor&s;e that &s;illy, girl, where may this end?&mdash;Lord ble&s;s me! If I &s;uffer my&s;elf to go on thus, &s;hall I not be the mo&s;t ungrateful of creatures? Shall I not, in&s;tead of my guardian's love, incur his hatred? Will not all the world de&s;pi&s;e me?&mdash;And where may this &s;top?"</Q>&mdash;Yet I went on excu&s;ing my&s;elf; for I knew I had no vile meaning: I knew I only wanted my guardian to love me, and to be allowed to love him. But what! thought I, at la&s;t, <HI>can</HI> I allow my&s;elf inloving a mar|ried man, the hu&s;band of my friend? And &s;ometimes I trembled at the thought; for I looked back; and &s;aid to my&s;elf, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Would&s;t thou, Emily, a year ago, have allowed in thy&s;elf but the &s;ame lengths that thou ha&s;t now run?"</Q>&mdash;No; an&s;wered I my own que&s;tion. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Is not this a fair warning of what may be a year hence?"</Q>&mdash;So I put a ca&s;e, to Dr. Bart|lett, as of three per&s;ons of my Anne's acquaintance, two young women, one young man, living in one hou&s;e: The young man contracted to one of the young women; the other knowing it; and tho' a per&s;on incapable of a criminal thought, yet finding an increa&s;ing regard for the young man, tho' &s;he dearly loved her friend, began to be afraid her heart was not quite as it &s;hould be: What, I a&s;ked, as for my Anne's friend, would he advi&s;e in the ca&s;e?</P>
<P>And what, my dear, was the Doctor's advice?</P>
<P>I was a &s;illy creature to put it to him. As I &s;aid, he certainly mu&s;t gue&s;s. If you, madam, <HI>could</HI> with|out &s;uch a ca&s;e put, he certainly mu&s;t. We young girls think, if we put our hands before our eyes, no|body can &s;ee us. In &s;hort, the Doctor pronounced the increa&s;ing regard to be a beginning Love. The con&s;equence would be, that the young woman would in time endeavour to &s;upplant her friend; tho' at pre|&s;ent &s;he might probably &s;hudder at the thought. He bid me tell Anne to warn her acquaintance again&s;t the growing flame. He &s;aid, &s;he might entangle her
<PB N="91" REF="92">
own heart, and without gaining her end, ren|der unhappy a couple, who, according to my repre|&s;entation from my Anne, de&s;erved to be happy: And he advi&s;ed, by all means, that &s;he &s;hould leave the contracted couple to them&s;elves, and for her own ho|nour's, her own heart's &s;ake, remove to as great di|&s;tance from them as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Believe me, madam, I was &s;hocked, I was frighted at my&s;elf: I threw the papers in the fire; and have been, ever &s;ince I read them, more unhappy than u&s;ual. My dear Lady Grandi&s;on, then thought I, I will, if you give me encouragement, open my heart to you. You will hear of my folly, my weakne&s;s, one day or other.&mdash;And now, dear good madam, forgive me: Keep my &s;ecret; and advi&s;e me what to do.</P>
<P>What, my deare&s;t creature, <HI>can</HI> I advi&s;e you? I love you. I ever will love you. I will be as careful of your honour as of my own. I will endeavour to cultivate your guardian's affection to you.</P>
<P>He never, madam, I hope, gue&s;&s;ed at the poor Emily's folly.</P>
<P>He never mentioned you to me, but with love and tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>Thank God!&mdash;But &s;ay, advi&s;e me, madam; my heart &s;hall be in your hand; guide it, as you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>What, my dear, did you think of doing your&s;elf?</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not think of living with you now, madam.</P>
<P>Why not? You &s;hall find me ever your true friend.</P>
<P>But I am &s;ure Dr. Bartlett's advice to Anne's ac|quaintance is right. I tell you, madam, that I mu&s;t every day, and every hour of the day, that I &s;ee his tender behaviour to you; that I behold him employed in acts of beneficence; that I &s;ee every one adoring him; admire him more. I &s;ee that I am le&s;s my own mi&s;tre&s;s than I thought it was po&s;&s;ible I could be: And if &s;uch a girl as I, have &s;o little command of my&s;elf, and his merit every hour &s;preading it&s;elf out before me with increa&s;ing lu&s;tre, my weak eyes will
<PB N="92" REF="93">
not be able to bear his glory&mdash;O madam, I ought to fly; I am re&s;olved, whatever it co&s;t me to fly.</P>
<P>How I admired, how I pitied, how I loved, the dear creature! I cla&s;ped both my arms about her, and pre&s;&s;ing her to my bo&s;om&mdash;What can I &s;ay, my Emi|ly? What <HI>can</HI> I &s;ay? Tell me, what would you wi&s;h me to &s;ay?</P>
<P>You are wi&s;e, madam: You have a tender and generous heart: O that I were half as good!&mdash;Advi&s;e me &s;omething&mdash;I &s;ee the folly of my wi&s;hing to live with you and my guardian.</P>
<P>And is it nece&s;&s;ary, my dear, to a conque&s;t of your&s;elf, that we &s;hould not live together?</P>
<P>Ab&s;olutely &s;o: I am convinced of it.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e, my dear, you go to the London hou&s;e, and put your&s;elf under Mrs. Grandi&s;on's protection?</P>
<P>What, madam, my guardian's hou&s;e &s;till?</P>
<P>I hope a few weeks ab&s;ence, by help of a di&s;cre|tion of which you have, in the pre&s;ent conver&s;ation, given &s;hining proofs, will an&s;wer all we wi&s;h; &s;ince you never, my dear, could have thought but of ad|miring, and that at di&s;tance, the great qualities of your guardian.</P>
<P>I have, 'tis true, but ju&s;t found my&s;elf out, I ne|ver could have hope of being looked upon in any o|ther light, than as his daughter; and I hope, I have made the di&s;covery in time. But I mu&s;t not be with him in his own hou&s;e. I mu&s;t not be in the way of his con&s;tant conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Admirable di&s;cretion! Amiable innocence!&mdash;Well then &s;uppo&s;e you reque&s;t Lady L. Lady G&mdash;</P>
<P>Ah, no, no! That would not do, neither. My guardianwould be the continual &s;ubject of our con|ver&s;ation; and often, very often, his brotherly good|ne&s;s would lead him to them; them to him.</P>
<P>Charming fortitude! Heroic Emily! How I admire you! I &s;ee you have thought attentively of this mat|ter. What <HI>are</HI> your thoughts?</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="94">
Can't you gue&s;s?</P>
<P>I know what I wi&s;h&mdash;But you mu&s;t &s;peak fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Don't you remember what the ble&s;&s;ed Mrs. Shirley (I mu&s;t call her ble&s;&s;ed!) &s;aid to me on your wedding|day, in the ve&s;try?</P>
<P>I do, my deare&s;t Emily! And are you inclined&mdash;</P>
<P>Shall I be received, madam, as a &s;econd Harriet in your family? It would be my ambition to tread in your &s;teps at Selby-hou&s;e and Shirley-manor; to hear <HI>from</HI> you; to write <HI>to</HI> you; to form my&s;elf by the mo|del, by which <HI>you</HI> were formed; to be called by Mrs. Shirley, by Mrs. Selby, <HI>their</HI> Emily.</P>
<P>How you would rejoice them all, my Emily! and, if we mu&s;t part, <HI>me,</HI> to have my Emily be to my dear|e&s;t friends what their Harriet &s;o happily was!</P>
<P>But, madam, will you undertake to procure my guardian's con&s;ent?</P>
<P>I will endeavour it.</P>
<P>Endeavour it! Then it is done. He will deny you nothing. Will good Mrs. Shirley con&s;ent?</P>
<P>I have no doubt but &s;he will, if your guardian do.</P>
<P>Will Mrs. Selby, will Mr. Selby, be <HI>my</HI> uncle and aunt?</P>
<P>We will con&s;ult them: They are happily with us, you know.</P>
<P>But, madam, there is one objection; a very great one.</P>
<P>What is that, my Love?</P>
<P>Your cou&s;in James Selby! I &s;hould re&s;pect him, as your cou&s;in, and as the brother of the two Mi&s;s Selby's: But that is all.</P>
<P>I never, my dear, approved of any motion of that kind. Not one of my friends think of it: They wi&s;h it not. He has met with di&s;couragement from every one of my family, and his own: He &s;ubmits to the di&s;couragement.</P>
<P>Then, madam, if you plea&s;e to break the matter to Mr. and Mrs. Selby; and to Mrs. Shirley, with|out
<PB N="94" REF="95">
letting them know the poor girl flies to them as for refuge again&s;t her&s;elf; and &s;atisfy Lady L. Lady G. and Mrs. Eleanor Grandi&s;on, that I mean nothing of &s;light to them; then will I attend Mr. and Mrs. Selby in their return home: And I &s;hall be in a while a very happy girl, I doubt not. But &s;till remember, madam, I mu&s;t love my guardian: But it &s;hall be with a Love that &s;hall not exclude Lady Grandi&s;on from a large &s;hare of it; the <HI>large&s;t,</HI> if I can. And now, cla&s;ping her arms about my neck, let me beg your pardon for all the &s;trange things I have &s;aid. My heart will be the ea&s;ier for having found a con|fident, &s;uch a confident, however, as no girl ever found before&mdash;But in this in&s;tance of goodne&s;s, you more than equal Lady Clementina her&s;elf; and a thou|&s;and, thou&s;and thanks for your patience with me on &s;uch a &s;ubject!&mdash;Yet &s;ay, &s;ay, my dear Lady Gran|di&s;on, you don't hate the poor girl, who has the va|nity to emulate you and Lady Clementina!</P>
<P>I wept over her from joy, pity, tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>Will you not, my dear grandmamma, love my Emily more than ever? Will you call her <HI>your</HI> Emi|ly, and think of her, as your Harriet?</P>
<P>Lady L. Lady G. will you excu&s;e the preference &s;he has given to quiet Northampton&s;hire, again&s;t noi&s;y London, and its gay &s;cenes, at &s;o young a time of Life?&mdash;<HI>Excu&s;e</HI> it! I am &s;ure you will think that the rea&s;on &s;he has given for the preference, lifts her up above woman.</P>

<P>I HAVE already obtained my uncle's and aunt's, and Lucy's, high approbation of Emily's propo&s;al. They, at her reque&s;t, a&s;ked Sir Charles's con&s;ent, as a favour. He de&s;ired to &s;ee her upon it. She came in, ba&s;hful, her &s;teps una&s;&s;ured, looking down. He took her hand: My good Emily, &s;aid he, I am told that you have a de&s;ire to re&s;tore to Mrs. Shirley, Mrs. Selby, and Mr. Selby, the grand&punc;daughter and
<PB N="95" REF="96">
niece I have robbed them of. They rejoice in your propo&s;al. You will be exceedingly happy in their protection. My Harriet will be loth to part with you; but for their &s;akes, as well as yours, &s;he will chearfully acquie&s;ce: And though we wanted it not, we &s;hall have an additional plea&s;ure in vi&s;iting North|ampton&s;hire.&mdash;It is your deliberate choice, my dear?</P>
<P>It is, Sir: And I hope I may be allowed to accom|pany Mrs. Selby down.</P>
<P>Settle the matter, Ladies, among your&s;elves. I have but one thing to add on the &s;ubject. You have a Mother, my dear. We mu&s;t not ab&s;olutely re&s;olve till we have her con&s;ent. She is good now: You mu&s;t make a compliment to my &s;i&s;ters, and their Lords al&s;o, and to my aunt Grandi&s;on&punc; They love my ward: And &s;he mu&s;t pre&s;erve every worthy per|&s;on's Love.</P>
<P>The dear girl courte&s;ied; wept&mdash;You are all&mdash;all goodne&s;s, Sir.</P>
<P>If your mind &s;hould change, my dear, don't be a|fraid to &s;ignify the alteration. It will be the bu&s;ine&s;s of us all to make each other happy. You will be al|ways dear to my Harriet. Recollect, mean time, if there be any-thing further in my power to oblige you.</P>
<P>O Sir! You mu&s;t not (&s;he ran to me, and in my bo&s;om, weeping, &s;poke out her &s;entence) be too good to me!</P>
<P>I ki&s;&s;ed the dear girl's forehead&mdash;Heroic Emily! whi&s;pered I, to confirm her in her heroi&s;m.</P>
<P>And thus already, my deare&s;t grandmamma, is this material article &s;ettled. My aunt an&s;wers for your approbation; and Lucy for the plea&s;ure that this acqui&s;ition, as I may call it, will give to Nancy, to Mi&s;s Holles's, and all our other kindred and acquaint|ance. But how, when the time comes, &s;hall I part with her?</P>
<P>What, I wonder, will Sir Edward Beauchamp &s;ay
<PB N="96" REF="97">
to this?&mdash;He mu&s;t get his dear friend's leave to vi&s;it with us Shirley-manor and Selby-hou&s;e, which I hope we &s;hall do twice a year at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>My Uncle and Aunt, Lucy, and Mr. Deane, are exceedingly rejoiced on this occa&s;ion: How fond are they of Emily! She of them! This gives them a re|lation to each other, that I hope will produce a friend|&s;hip which will la&s;t for ever.</P>
<P>My Aunt and Lucy have been a&s;king my opinion, whether Sir Charles did not di&s;cover &s;omething of the good girl's growing affection for him; &s;o undi&s;gui&s;ed|ly &s;incere as &s;he always was, and for &s;ome time not &s;u&s;pecting her&s;elf; he &s;o penetrating a man? Of this, &s;aid Lucy, I am &s;ure, he would have &s;een it with half an eye, had any other man been as much the object of her regard.</P>
<P>If any thing would induce me, &s;aid I, to think he did, it would be his ready acquie&s;cence with her pro|po&s;al, and from his being &s;o little inqui&s;itive after her motives for leaving us: The ca&s;e, continued I, is of &s;o nice a nature, that he never will &s;ay, even to me, what his thoughts are upon it, if &s;uch thoughts he has. And as to my&s;elf, it would be dealing with Emily le&s;s delicately than I was dealt with by the two noble &s;i&s;ters, &s;hould I pre&s;ume to &s;ound him on &s;o nice a &s;ubject.</P>
<P>And indeed there never could be a man in the world that had a greater regard than he has to tho&s;e real de|licacies of our Sex, which border not upon what is called <HI>Prudery.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Lowther is gone to London: He has given in|to Sir Charles's wi&s;hes, to &s;ettle in this neighbourhood. He &s;aid, he liked the country: He had no particular attachment to any place; and made a fine compli|ment to Sir Charles on the occa&s;ion. I need not &s;ay, it was a ju&s;t one.</P>
<P>My uncle, my aunt, write. Lucy has another long Letter almo&s;t ready. I have only further to

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My</HI> Grandi&s;on,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will be &s;urpri&s;ed&mdash;a&s;toni&s;hed&mdash;The dear Clementina! How has &s;he tarni&s;hed all her glo|ry! A young creature of her nice honour!&mdash;Good
<PB N="98" REF="99">
God!&mdash;And mu&s;t I her brother, your Jeronymo, ex|po&s;e his &s;i&s;ter?</P>
<P>We gave into almo&s;t every wi&s;h of her heart. The dear <HI>Scripturi&s;t</HI> had reque&s;ted a month's time to travel from place to place on the other &s;ide of the Apen|nines, partly in imitation of the daughter of the fa|mous I&s;raeliti&s;h General <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Jephthah. See Judges xi.</NOTE>; and partly on pretence of e&s;tabli&s;hing her health; implying, that &s;he con|&s;idered the meditated marriage as a &s;acrifice: And we had hopes at the end of it, that &s;he would be brought to give her hand, not unchearfully, to the Count of Belvedere, for whom &s;he owned pity and gratitude.</P>
<P>We had con&s;ented to &s;everal trifling delays of her return to us before. Yet be&s;ought her to excu&s;e us from allowing her to vi&s;it Rome and Naples; and &s;he acquie&s;ced with the rea&s;ons we gave her. She de&s;ired leave to take into her &s;ervice, as a page, an Engli&s;h youth, the nephew of a gentleman of the Engli&s;h factory at Leghorn, who was well recom|mended by his uncle, on the enquiry Mrs. Beaumont, at our de&s;ire, made into his character. We, &s;up|po&s;ing her motive to be merely an innocent and grate|ful regard to the country of a man whom we could allow her to re&s;pect, con&s;ented. She accordingly took him; and he attended her in her excur&s;ions to Pi&s;toia, Prato, Pratolina, Pi&s;a, Sienna, &amp;c.; to &s;ome of which places &s;he was accompanied by Mrs. Beaumont, and the Ladies her friends. But being de&s;irous to &s;ee the &s;ea-coa&s;t from Piombino to Lucca, according to a plan &s;he &s;hewed; and talking of &s;tretching to Ge|noa, when at Lucca; which was to conclude her excur&s;ions, and complete her month; &s;he was left by tho&s;e Ladies to be attended by her own &s;ervants: The&s;e, all but her page and Laura, &s;he contrived (the high-&s;oul'd Clementina &s;tooped to art!) to &s;end dif|ferent ways, ordering them to meet her at Lucca; but, in&s;tead of going thither, took a &s;hort way to
<PB N="99" REF="100">
Leghorn; and there embarked on board an Engli&s;h &s;hip ready cleared out, and bound for the port of London; and it had &s;ailed three days, before it was known what was become of her. But then the con|tents of the following Letter, directed to Mrs. Beau|mont, a&s;toni&s;hed that Lady, and her friends; as you will believe it did us, when it was tran&s;mitted to us in a Letter written by Mrs. Beaumont, acquainting us with the particulars of her excur&s;ions and flight; and the certainty, upon proper enquiries at Leghorn, that &s;he was gone to England.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Forgive me, my deare&s;t Ladies; my deare&s;t Mrs. Beaumont, particularly, forgive me! I am embarked in an enterprize, that will be enough my puni&s;hment. Pity me, therefore, as well as pardon me! The impending evil is always the mo&s;t terrible. My heart is extremely aver&s;e to a married life. A fortnight of the month is ex|pired, at the end of which I am expected to give my vows to a man not unworthy of them, could I think it in my power to make him happy, and could I be &s;o my&s;elf in the pro&s;pects before me: But how can that be? Per&s;ua&s;ion, cruel per&s;ua|&s;ion! A kneeling father, a fighing mother; gene|rous, but entreating brothers; how, how can I re|&s;i&s;t you, if I go to dear, once <HI>mo&s;t</HI> dear Bologna? All you, my friends, at Bologna, at Urbino, <HI>every|where,</HI> forgive me! What have I not &s;uffered be|fore I came to the re&s;olution that mu&s;t be pur&s;ued, tho' repentance, when I have attained the pro|po&s;ed a&s;ylum, follow! My good Lord of B. for|give me al&s;o. Change your attachment. You de&s;erve a better wife, than con&s;cience, than ho|nour, than ju&s;tice (words that mean the &s;ame thing) tell me, can be made you, by the unhappy Clementina. She dare not add Della Porretta.&mdash;Ah my mother!"</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>This Letter was left with a per&s;on at Leghorn,
<PB N="100" REF="101">
with orders, not to &s;end it, till the ve&s;&s;el had &s;ailed three days. We are all di&s;tracted; but mo&s;t my mo|ther.</P>
<P>For the &s;ake of <HI>her</HI> peace of mind, we are come to a re&s;olution to anticipate our &s;ummers vi&s;it to you; and, unpropitious as the &s;ea&s;on is for &s;uch a journey, we &s;hall &s;et out next week accordingly. God give my mother &s;trength to bear the fatigue! Courage &s;he has, on <HI>this</HI> occa&s;ion, who never before could be brought to go by &s;ea any-where: No, not to Naples, to vi&s;it her Giacomo, and his Lady, tho' in a more propitious &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>It was a long-laid &s;cheme, we imagine; for &s;he had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her faithful Camilla, on her urging her to a change of condition. I am afraid the good wo|man was too &s;edulous in obeying the orders given her by my brother, to make u&s;e of every opportunity to in&s;pire her with tender &s;entiments, in favour of the Count of Belvedere. Laura has for &s;ome time been her only favourite &s;ervant.</P>
<P>This youth, by name Antony Dagley, no doubt has managed this affair for her.</P>
<P>Mrs. Beaumont now recollects &s;everal circum&s;tan|ces, which, could &s;he have &s;u&s;pected Clementina to be capable of &s;uch an enterprize, might have given her &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>The ve&s;&s;el &s;he is in, is called <HI>The Scanderoon:</HI> Alexander Hender&s;on ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>How can the dear creature on her arrival in Eng|land look You, your Lady, your Si&s;ters, in the face? What may &s;he &s;uffer, in &s;uch a voyage, at &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on! To what in&s;ults may &s;he be expo&s;ed! So little as &s;he knows of the Engli&s;h tongue! Laura not a &s;yllable of it! Depending on the fidelity of a &s;tranger-boy! So few changes of apparel as &s;he had the opportunity to take with her!&mdash;Whether pro|vided with any con&s;iderable &s;ums of money, we know not! England, in her opinion, a nation of
<PB N="101" REF="102">
heretics!&mdash;Good Heaven! could Clementina della Porretta be guilty of &s;uch a ra&s;hne&s;s?</P>
<P>But what an aver&s;ene&s;s mu&s;t &s;he have to marriage! We have certainly been too precipitating. You cau|tioned us: Yet, I dare &s;ay, could not have believed, that our Clementina could have taken &s;uch a &s;tep. But, alas! we conclude, that it is owing more to the effects of her late unhappy malady, than to any other cau&s;e. When once the mind is di&s;ordered, there is danger, it &s;eems, of its &s;hewing it&s;elf, on ex|traordinary occa&s;ions, even after the cure is &s;uppo&s;ed to be perfected, capable of extravagance. Again I &s;ay, we have been too ha&s;ty.&mdash;Our brother Giaco|mo!&mdash;But he is the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted of men. He would not otherwi&s;e be &s;o urgent as he is for her <HI>mar|riage.</HI></P>
<P>Dear, dear creature! How my heart bleeds for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es &s;he may be thrown into!&mdash;But they cannot be equal to tho&s;e which her mother feels for her. Clementina knows how much the lives of her father and mother are bound up in hers. But I repeat, &s;he mu&s;t be under the influences of her former malady, or never, never, could &s;he have done an act, that &s;he mu&s;t know would wound our very &s;ouls.</P>
<P>From the lights I have held out, we hope you will be able to find her before &s;he can have &s;uffered more than the inconveniencies of the voyage; before &s;he can have wanted money, or other conveniencies. If you do, your &s;i&s;ters will give the ra&s;h one countenance and protection till we can arrive.</P>
<P>Our company will be, my Father, Mother, the Bi&s;hop, your Jeronymo, Father Mare&s;cotti, and our two cou&s;ins Seba&s;tiano and Juliano. Mrs. Beaumont has the goodne&s;s, purely from motives of charity, to accompany my mother. Poor Camilla, almo&s;t as incon&s;olable as my mother, attends her Lady.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t give you the trouble of hiring for us as large a hou&s;e as you can procure. The circum&s;tances
<PB N="102" REF="103">
we are in, allow us not to think of any-thing more than common convenience, and to be incognito.</P>
<P>Our two cou&s;ins above-named may be in lodgings, if room be wanted.</P>
<P>We &s;hall have no more than nece&s;&s;ary attendants.</P>
<P>A le&s;&s;er hou&s;e, or hand&s;ome lodgings will content the Count of Belvedere.</P>
<P>The&s;e cares for us, my dear Grandi&s;on, we mu&s;t throw upon you: Yet, if my Lowther be in Eng|land, he will be &s;o kind as to ea&s;e you of part of them. You will have concern enough in &s;haring ours, for the occa&s;ion which carries us to you, &s;o much &s;ooner than we intended, and in an inconve|nient &s;ea&s;on; circum&s;tances that will &s;ufficiently de|mon&s;trate the di&s;tre&s;s we are in.</P>
<P>The ve&s;&s;el we have hired, is called, <HI>The Leghorn Frigate.</HI> The ma&s;ter's name is Arthur Gunning. If we are favoured in our voyage, the ma&s;ter hopes to be in your river Thames in about three weeks from our embarking.</P>
<P>God give us, my Grandi&s;on, a meeting not <HI>un|happy!</HI> May we find the dear fugitive &s;afe in your protection, or under the wings of one of your noble &s;i&s;ters!</P>
<P>I hope this unhappy affair will produce no unea&s;i|ne&s;s between your Lady and you. If it &s;hould, what an additional evil would the dear ra&s;h one have to an&s;wer for!</P>
<P>The General is too much incen&s;ed again&s;t the un|happy girl, to think of accompanying us, could he obtain permi&s;&s;ion of his &s;overeign.</P>
<P>The lea&s;t reparation the dear creature can make us, the Bi&s;hop &s;ays, is, chearfully to give her vows to the good Count of Belvedere, who looks forward to the i&s;&s;ue of this affair, as the cri&s;is of his fate.</P>
<P>I hardly know what I have written; nor how to leave off. It is to <HI>you,</HI> our dear friend, our con&s;oler, our brother, and, let me add, our refuge, next to
<PB N="103" REF="104">
that Almighty, who we hope will guide us in &s;afety to you, and give an i&s;&s;ue not greatly derogatory to the glory of our &s;i&s;ter, and family. Join, my Gran|di&s;on, your prayers with ours, to this purpo&s;e. No|ble&s;t of friends, Adieu!</P>

<P>LET me now give you the promi&s;ed particulars.</P>
<P>As we, and our beloved gue&s;ts, were at dinner on Monday, all harmony, all love; the dear Emily laying out the happy days &s;he hoped to &s;ee in North|hampton&s;hire; Sir Charles u&s;ing generous arguments to prevail on my uncle and aunt to &s;tay a little longer with him; the Letter, the affecting Letter, was given into Sir Charles's hands: "From my Jerony|mo!" &s;aid he, looking at the &s;uper&s;cription. A&s;king excu&s;e, he broke it open, and, ca&s;ting his eye upon the fir&s;t lines, he &s;tarted; and bowing to his gue&s;ts, and to me, he aro&s;e from table, and withdrew to his Study.</P>
<P>We had not half dined. I urged our friends, but could not &s;et them the example; and we aro&s;e by con&s;ent, and went into the adjoining drawing-room.</P>
<P>Sir Charles &s;oon joined us there: His face was in a glow: He &s;eemed to have &s;truggled for a compo&s;ure, for our &s;akes, which, however, he had not obtained.</P>
<P>I looked upon him with eyes, I &s;uppo&s;e, that had &s;peech in them, by his taking my hand, and &s;aying, Be not &s;urpri&s;ed, my Love: You will &s;oon have gue&s;ts.</P>
<P>From Italy! From Italy, Sir!&mdash;"Yes, my life"&mdash;Who? Who, Sir?</P>
<P>Dr. Bartlett was with us. He be&s;ought him to
<PB N="104" REF="105">
give a tran&s;lation of that Letter. The Doctor retired to do it: And Sir Charles &s;aid, It is not impo&s;&s;ible but Clementina may be &s;oon in England: Perhaps be|fore the re&s;t of her family. Be not &s;urpri&s;ed (for we all looked upon one another): Dr. Bartlett will give you the contents of the Letter. Oblige me, my dear|e&s;t Love, with your hand.</P>
<P>He led me into his Study; and there, in the mo&s;t tender and affectionate manner, acquainted me with the contents of the Letter.</P>
<P>My deare&s;t Harriet, &s;aid he, his arms encircling my wai&s;t, will not, cannot doubt the continuance of my tendere&s;t Love. I am equally &s;urpri&s;ed and di&s;turbed at the &s;tep taken. God pre&s;erve the dear Clementina! Join your prayers with mine for her &s;afety. You can pity the unhappy Lady: She is, I am afraid, de|&s;olate and unprotected: You can pity her <HI>equally</HI> un|happy friends. They are following her: They are all good: They mean well. Yet over-per&s;ua&s;ion, as you lately ob&s;erved, in &s;uch a ca&s;e a hers, is a degree of per&s;ecution. In the unhappy circum&s;tances &s;he had been in, &s;he <HI>&s;hould</HI> have had time given her. Time &s;ubdues all things.</P>
<P>Let me be&s;eech you, Sir, &s;aid I, to give the un|happy Lady your <HI>in&s;tant</HI> protection. Con&s;ider me as a &s;trengthener, not a weakener, of your hands, in her &s;ervice. I have no concern but for her &s;afety and honour, and for your concern on the affecting occa|&s;ion. Dear Sir, let me by participation le&s;&s;en it.</P>
<P>Soul of my Soul, &s;aid he, cla&s;ping me more ardent|ly to his bo&s;om, I had no doubt of your generous goodne&s;s. It would be doing inju&s;tice to the unhap|py <HI>ab&s;ent,</HI> and to the knowledge I have of my <HI>own heart,</HI> as well as to <HI>you,</HI> the ab&s;olute mi&s;tre&s;s of it, did I think it nece&s;&s;ary to make profe&s;&s;ions of my unalterable, my inviolable Love to you. I will ac|quaint you with every &s;tep I take in this arduous af|fair. You mu&s;t advi&s;e me as I go along. Minds &s;o
<PB N="105" REF="106">
delicate as your and Clementina's, mu&s;t be allied. I &s;hall be &s;ure of my mea&s;ures when I have the appro|bation of my Harriet. All <HI>our</HI> friends (They have di&s;cretion) &s;hall be made acquainted with my proceed|ings. I will not leave a doubt upon the mind of any one of them, that my Harriet is not, as far as it is in my power to make her, the happie&s;t of women.</P>
<P>What, Sir, is the date of the Letter?&mdash;He looked; It has no date, my dear, Jeronymo's grief&mdash;The Lady, Sir, &s;aid I, may be arrived. Leave me here at Gran|di&s;on-hall, with my friends: I will endeavour to engage their &s;tay a little longer than they had de&s;igned; and do you ha&s;ten up to town: If you can do &s;ervice to the unhappy Lady, de&s;titute as you apprehend &s;he is at pre&s;ent of protection, and expo&s;ed to difficulties and dangers, your Letters &s;hall be, if po&s;&s;ible, more ac|ceptable to me, than even the pre&s;ence of the man who is as dear to me as my own &s;oul.</P>
<P>I was rai&s;ed. It was making me great, my dear Ladies, to have it in my <HI>power,</HI> as I may &s;ay, to con|vince Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, that my compa&s;&s;ion, my love, my a lmiration of the noble&s;t of women, was a <HI>&s;incere</HI> admiration and love.</P>
<P>How happy a man am I! &s;aid he. You have an|ticipated me by your goodne&s;s. I will ha&s;ten up to town. You will engage your friends. The man who&s;e Love is fixed on the <HI>mind,</HI> all loveline&s;s as is the admirable per&s;on that thus I again pre&s;s to my fond bo&s;om, mu&s;t be as happy as a mortal man can be!</P>
<P>He led me back to the expecting company: Who all &s;tood up, as by an involuntary motion, at our entrance; each per&s;on looking eager to know our &s;entiments. The Doctor had not fini&s;hed the tran&s;la|tion: But Sir Charles &s;ent up for the Letter; and&punc; begged of the Doctor, who brought it down him&s;elf, to read it in Engli&s;h to us all. He did &s;o.</P>
<P>What, my dear Ladies, was there of <HI>Peculiarity</HI> in
<PB N="106" REF="107">
my genero&s;ity, as your brother was plea&s;ed to call it?&mdash;My uncle, my aunt, my Lucy, Mr. Deane, all, <HI>before</HI> Sir Charles could well &s;peak, be&s;ought him not to &s;uffer their being here to be one moment's hindrance to his &s;etting out for London.</P>
<P>He generou&s;ly applauded me to them for what had pa&s;&s;ed between us in his Study, and told them, he would &s;et out early in the morning, if they would promi&s;e to keep me company here.</P>
<P>They &s;aid, they would &s;tay as long as their convenience would permit; and the longer, that he might be the ea&s;ier on &s;uch a generous call to town.</P>
<P>One thing, dear Sir, &s;aid I, let me beg; Let not the &s;weet fugitive be <HI>compelled,</HI> if you can help it, to marry. Let not advantage be taken, as they &s;eem, by a hint in this Letter, inclined to take it, of this &s;eem|ing ra&s;h &s;tep, to make her compliance the condition of their forgivene&s;s and reconciliation.</P>
<P>He called me his generous, his noble Harriet; re|peated, that he would be governed by my advice, and that then he &s;hould be &s;ure of his footing.</P>
<P>Your brother &s;et out early this morning for Lon|don: Join your prayers, my dear Ladies, with his and mine, and with tho&s;e of all our friends here, for a happy i&s;&s;ue to the pre&s;ent afflictions of the dear Cle|mentina. How I long, yet half-fear, to &s;ee her! Shall I, do you think, be able to &s;ee her, without being ap|prehen&s;ive, that &s;he will look upon me as the invader of her right? She was undoubtedly his fir&s;t Love.</P>
<P>Your brother communicated to me his intention of completing the furni&s;hing of the new-taken hou&s;e in Gro&s;venor-&s;quare, which was before in great forward|ne&s;s, and to have it well aired for the reception of his noble friends. He will acquaint his &s;i&s;ters with his further intentions, as occa&s;ions ari&s;e. God &s;ucceed to him his own wi&s;hes!&mdash;He may be tru&s;ted with them.</P>

<SALUTE>My deare&s;t Life,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON my arrival here la&s;t Night I found a long Let|ter, dated Sunday la&s;t, from the unhappy Lady, whom we both &s;o much admire and pity. The con|tents too well confirm her wandering &s;tate of mind, and account for the &s;teps &s;he has taken. I will &s;end you the Letter it&s;elf as &s;oon as I have &s;een her, and can prevail upon her to put her&s;elf into my protection. Till the hope of a happier &s;tate of mind &s;hall dawn upon us, the contents of it will afflict you.</P>
<P>She has been ten days in England: I wrote to her la&s;t night, to beg her to admit me to her pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>She expre&s;&s;es in her Letter a generous joy in our happine&s;s, and in the excellent character which &s;he has heard of the beloved of my heart; of <HI>every</HI> heart. In the mid&s;t of her affecting wanderings, &s;he pre&s;erves the greatne&s;s of mind that ever di&s;tingui&s;hed her. She wi&s;hes to &s;ee you; but unknown to us both.</P>
<P>It would not be difficult perhaps to find out the place of her abode; but &s;he depends on my honour, that I will not attempt it: Clementina loves to be puncti|liou&s;ly ob&s;erved. In the way &s;he is in, &s;he mu&s;t be &s;oothed, and as little oppo&s;ed as po&s;&s;ible. She thinks too highly of my character, and apprehends that the &s;tep &s;he has taken, has lowered her own. She has great &s;en&s;ibility, and only <HI>&s;ometimes</HI> wanders into mi|nutene&s;&s;es that her circum&s;tances, which I find are not happy, oblige her to attend to. I have great hopes, that I &s;hall be able to &s;ooth, conciliate, and re&s;tore her; her mind &s;eems not to he deeply wounded. God enable me to quiet the heart of the noble&s;t of your Si&s;ters! Forgive me for my two beloved Si&s;ters. <HI>They</HI> will, if <HI>you</HI> do.</P>

I hope our dear friends will make them&s;elves and you happy, at Grandi&s;on-hall.

<P>BY this time, it is very probable, you have heard of the ra&s;he&s;t &s;tep that the writer of the&s;e pre|&s;ents (chequer'd and unhappy, as the la&s;t years of her life have been) over took. She knows it to be ra&s;h: She condemns her&s;elf for taking it. She doubts not but &s;he &s;hall be condemned by every-body for it: Nor is &s;he &s;ure, that &s;he &s;hall have the better opinion of your ju&s;tice, if you are not one of the &s;evere&s;t of her cen&s;ur|ers: For you are a good man. Your goodne&s;s, I hear, fills every mouth in this your own country; and it is not one of your lea&s;t prai&s;es, that you did your duty in the &s;tricte&s;t manner, to a Father, who was want|ing in his to his whole family. It is, it &s;eems, your principle, that where a duty is reciprocal, the failure in it of the one, acquits not the other for a failure in his. How then can I appear before you? I am co|ver'd with blu&s;hes at the thoughts of it&mdash;I, who am a runaway from the kinde&s;t, the mo&s;t indulgent, of parents&mdash;God forgive me!&mdash;Yet, can I &s;ay, I re|pent?
<PB N="109" REF="110">
&mdash;I <HI>think,</HI> I can.&mdash;But at be&s;t, it is a conditional repentance only, that I boa&s;t.</P>
<P>I am here in your England; I cannot, cannot, tell you where; in a low condition; my fortune &s;canty; my lodgings not very convenient; two &s;ervants on|ly my attendants; Laura (you remember <HI>her)</HI> one; weeping every hour after her friends, and our Italy: My other you know not&mdash;My page he was called in the days of my &s;tate, as I may, comparatively, call them; but now my every thing: Poor youth! But he is hone&s;t, he is faithful. God reward him!&mdash;I cannot.</P>
<P>Yet in all this my depre&s;&s;ion of circum&s;tances, if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf, and &s;ometimes (too often in|deed) of &s;pirits; I think I am happy in the thought that I am a &s;ingle woman.</P>
<P>Well, Sir!&mdash;And what can I &s;ay further? A thou|&s;and things I have to &s;ay: Too many, to know which to &s;ay fir&s;t. I had better &s;ay no more: I am not, how|ever, &s;ure, I &s;hall &s;end you this, or any other Letter.</P>
<P>I have been ten days in this great, and, as it &s;eems to me, ugly city: A va&s;tly populous one: People very bu&s;y. I thought your London people were all rich&mdash;But what is this to write to you about?</P>
<P>I have been out but once, and that for a morning in one of your parks. I can't &s;ay, I like England, nor its people, much: But I have &s;een nothing of the one, or the other.</P>
<P>I live a very melancholy life: But that befits me be&s;t.</P>
<P>They tell me, that your churches are poor, plain things. You be&s;tow more upon your&s;elves than you do upon your God: But perhaps you tru&s;t more to the heart, than to the eye, in the plainne&s;s of your places of devotion. But, again, what is all this &s;tuff to you?&mdash;Yet, I am apt to ramble too-too much!</P>
<P>The truth is, I am not very well: So excu&s;e me.</P>
<P>But do you know how it comes about, that having
<PB N="110" REF="111">
the be&s;t of fathers, the be&s;t of mothers, the mo&s;t af|fectionate of brothers, I &s;hould yet think them per|&s;ecutors? How it comes about, that I, who love them, who honour them, as much as daughter ever honoured parents, or &s;i&s;ter ever loved brothers, &s;hould run away from them all, into a &s;trange land, a land of heretics; yet once be thought a pious kind of crea|ture? Do you know how this comes about?</P>
<P>Once there was a man&mdash;But him I renounced&mdash;But I had a good rea&s;on for it. And do you think I repent it? By my truth, Chevalier, I do not: I ne|ver did. Yet I think of nobody half &s;o often, nor with half the plea&s;ure: For, tho' a Heretic, he is a good man.</P>
<P>But hu&s;h! Dare I, in this country, &s;ay he is a Heretic? Perhaps, we Catholics are looked upon as Heretics here. Idolaters I know we are &s;aid to be&mdash;I grant that I had like to have been an idolater once&mdash;But let that pa&s;s. I believe we Catholics think wor&s;e of you Prote&s;tants, and you Prote&s;tants think wor&s;e of us Catholics, than either de&s;erve: It may be &s;o. But, to me, you &s;eem to be a &s;trange people, for all that.</P>
<P>Of one thing, my good Chevalier, methinks I &s;hould be glad.&mdash;Here I am told you are married: That I knew before I left Italy: El&s;e, let me tell you, I never would have come hither: Yet I &s;hould have got away rather than be married my&s;elf, I believe: But then perhaps it would have been to a Catholic country.</P>
<P>What was I going to &s;ay?&mdash;One thing I &s;hould be glad of: It is to &s;ee your Lady; but not if &s;he were to &s;ee me. I came with very few cloaths, and they were not the be&s;t I had at Florence: My be&s;t of all are at Bologna. My father and mother loved to &s;ee me dre&s;&s;ed. I dre&s;&s;ed many a time to plea&s;e them more than to plea&s;e my&s;elf. For I am not a proud creature: Do you think I am? You knew me once
<PB N="111" REF="112">
better than I knew my&s;elf: But you know little of me now. I am a runaway: And I know you won't for|give me. I can't help it. However, I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee your Lady. She dre&s;&s;es richly, I &s;uppo&s;e. Well &s;he may!</P>
<P>I am told, &s;he is one of the lovelie&s;t women in England: And as to her goodne&s;s&mdash;there is nobody &s;o good. Thank God! You know, Chevalier, I always prayed, that the be&s;t of women might be called by your name.</P>
<P>But Olivia, it &s;eems, prai&s;es her; and Olivia &s;aw her when &s;he was a rambler to England, as, God help me! I am now.</P>
<P>But Olivia's motive and mine were very different. Olivia went to England in hopes of a hu&s;band&mdash;Poor woman! I pity her.</P>
<P>But, Chevalier, cannot I &s;ee your Lady, and &s;he not &s;ee me? I need not be in di&s;gui&s;e to &s;ee her. If you were with her, handing her, &s;uppo&s;e, to church, (I would not &s;cruple to croud my&s;elf into &s;ome unob|&s;erved corner of <HI>your</HI> church on &s;uch an occa&s;ion) you would be too proud of <HI>her</HI> to mind <HI>me:</HI> And you would not know me, if you &s;aw me; for I would &s;toop in my &s;houlders, and look down; and the cloaths I &s;hould have on would be only an Engli&s;h linen gown and petticoat, unadorned by ribbands or gew-gaw&mdash;Not half &s;o well dre&s;&s;ed as your Lady's woman&punc;</P>
<P>But yet I &s;hould thank God, that you had not di&s;|graced the regard I had once for you: I had a great deal of pride, you know, in that hope. Thank you, Sir, that you have married &s;o lovely and &s;o de&s;erving a woman. She is of a good family, I hope.</P>
<P>It wa a great di&s;appointment to me when I came fir&s;t to London, to find, that you were not there. I thought, &s;ome how or other, to catch a &s;ight of you and your Lady, were it but as you &s;tept into your coach; and I to have been in a chair, near, or even on foot. For, when I heard what a character you bore,
<PB N="112" REF="113">
for every kind of goodne&s;s; I, a poor fagitive, was afraid to &s;ee you. So many good le&s;&s;ons as you taught me, and all to come to this! Unhappy Clementina!</P>
<P>Where will your Lady&s;hip (but I have forbidden that &s;tile) choo&s;e to take up your re&s;idence? &s;aid An|thony when we fir&s;t landed (My &s;ervant's name is Anthony; but you &s;hall not know his other name). We landed among a parcel of guns, at the Tower, they called it, in a boat.</P>
<P>Laura an&s;wered for me; for he &s;poke in Italian; Somewhere near the Chevalier Grandi&s;on's, won't you, madam? I won't tell you what was my an&s;wer; for perhaps I am near the Thames&mdash;I don't want you to find me out. I be&s;eech you, Chevalier, don't give your&s;elf pain for me. I am a fugitive. Don't di&s;grace your&s;elf in acknowleging any acquaintance with a creature who is poor and low; and who <HI>de&s;erves</HI> to be poor and low; for is &s;he not a runaway from the be&s;t of parents? But it is to avoid, not to get, a hu&s;|band; you'll be plea&s;ed to remember that, Sir.</P>
<P>But, poor Laura&mdash;I am &s;orry for Laura; more &s;or|ry than for my&s;elf&mdash;My brother Giacomo would kill the poor creature, I believe, if ever &s;he were to come in his way. But &s;he is in no fault. It was with great reluctance &s;he obeyed her mi&s;tre&s;s. She was &s;everal times as impertinent as Camilla. Poor Camilla! I u&s;ed ever hardly. She is a good creature. I u&s;ed her hardly again&s;t my own nature, to make her the ea&s;ier to part with me. I love her. I hope &s;he is well. It is not worth her while to pine after me; I was an un|grateful creature to her.</P>
<P>My Anthony is a good young man, as I told you. I think to &s;ave half his wages, and give the other half to rai&s;e Laura's, to keep her a little in heart. The poor young man hoped preferment in my &s;ervice; and I can do nothing for him. It will behove me to be a good manager. But I will &s;ell the few jewels I have left, rather than part with him, till he can get a better
<PB N="113" REF="114">
&s;ervice. What little things do I trouble you with! Little things to you; but not quite &s;o little to me now, as I have managed it. But &s;o as I can do ju&s;tice to this poor youth, and poor Laura, I matter not my&s;elf. What I have done is my choice: They had no op|tion. I over-per&s;uaded Laura, as my friends would have done me. I feel that &s;ting: It was not doing as I would be done by. Very, very wicked in me! I dare &s;ay, you would tell me &s;o, were you to find me out.</P>
<P>But, Chevalier, &s;hall I &s;end you, yes, or no, this &s;crawl, written to divert me in a pen&s;ive mood? I would not, if I thought it would trouble you. God forbid that your pupil Clementina &s;hould give you di&s;|compo&s;ure, now e&s;pecially in the early part of your nuptials! Yet if I could &s;o manage, as that you would permit your &s;ecretary (I would not a&s;k the favour of your own pen) to &s;end a few lines to &s;ome parti|cular place, where my &s;ervant could fetch them un|known to you or any body, only to let me know, If you have heard from Bologna, or Naples, or Florence (I was very ungrateful to good Mrs. Beaumont and the Ladies her friends) and how they all do; my fa|ther, mother (my heart at times bleeds for them) my dear Jeronymo, my two other brothers, and good Father Mare&s;cotti, and my &s;i&s;ter-in-law whom I have &s;o much rea&s;on to love; it will be a great ea&s;e to my heart; provided the account be not a <HI>very</HI> melancholy one&punc; If it &s;hould, poor Clementina's days would be number'd upon twice five fingers.</P>
<P>I am put in a way&mdash;This &s;hall be &s;ent to your pa|lace in town. You will order your &s;ecretary to direct his Letter, to George Trumbull, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> to be left till called for, at White's Chocolate-hou&s;e in St. James's-&s;treet. I depend upon your honour, Chevalier, that you will acquie&s;ce with my de&s;ire to remain incognita, till I &s;hall con&s;ent to reveal to you the place of my abode, or to &s;ee you el&s;ewhere.

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Monday, Febr. <HI>19.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU reque&s;ted me, my deare&s;t Harriet, to write minutely to you. Now I have been admitted to the pre&s;ence of Clementina, and have hopes that &s;he will &s;oon recover her peace of mind, I can the more chearfully obey you.</P>
<P>I was exactly at the hour at the appointed place. Laura gue&s;&s;ed at my chair, and my &s;ervants, as they cro&s;&s;ed the way; and &s;tood out on the pavement, that I might &s;ee her. When &s;he found &s;he had caught my eye, &s;he ran into the hou&s;e, wringing her cla&s;ped hands&mdash;God be prai&s;ed! God be prai&s;ed! were her words, as I followed her in, in her own language. Laura can &s;peak no other. Shew me, &s;hew me, to your Lady, good Laura! &s;aid I, with emotion.</P>
<P>She ran up one pair of &s;tairs before me. She en|tered the dining-room, as it is called. I &s;topt at the &s;tairs head till I had Clementina's commands. Laura &s;oon came out. She held open the door for me, cour|tefying in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>The drawn window-curtains darkened the room: But the dignity of Clementina's air and motion left me not in doubt. She &s;tood up, &s;upporting her&s;elf on the back of an elbow chair.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="120">
On one knee, taking her trembling hand; Wel|come, thrice welcome to England, deare&s;t Lady Cle|mentina! I pre&s;&s;ed her hand with my lips; and ri&s;ing, &s;eated her: For &s;he trembled; &s;he &s;obbed; &s;he en|deavoured to &s;peak, but could not for &s;ome moments.</P>
<P>I called to Laura, fearing &s;he was fainting.</P>
<P>O that well-known voice! &s;aid &s;he. And do you, <HI>can</HI> you, bid me welcome?&mdash;Me, a fugitive, an in|grate, undutiful!&mdash;O Chevalier, lower not your un|fullied character, by approving &s;o unnatural a &s;tep as that which I have taken!</P>
<P>I <HI>do</HI> bid you welcome, madam! Your brother, your friend, from his &s;oul, welcomes you to England.</P>
<P>Let me know, Chevalier, before another word pa&s;|&s;es, Whether I have a Father, whether I have a Mother?</P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ed be God, madam, you have both.</P>
<P>She lifted up her cla&s;ped hand: Thank God! God, I thank thee! Di&s;traction would have been my portion, if I had not! I was afraid to a&s;k after them. I &s;hould have thought my&s;elf the mo&s;t dete&s;table of parricides, if either of them had been no more.</P>
<P>They are in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s for your &s;afety. They will think them&s;elves happy, when they know you are well, and in the protection of your brother Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>Will they, Sir? O what a paradox! They &s;o in|dulgent, yet &s;o cruel&mdash;I, &s;o dutiful, yet a fugitive! But tell me, Sir; determined as I was again&s;t enter|ing into a &s;tate I too much honour to enter into it with a reluctant heart, <HI>could</HI> I take any other &s;tep than that I have taken, to free my&s;elf from the <HI>cruelty</HI> of <HI>per&s;ua&s;ion?</HI> O that I might have been permitted to take the veil!&mdash;But an&s;wer my que&s;tion, Chevalier?</P>
<P>Surely, madam, they would <HI>not</HI> have compelled you. They always declared to me they would not.</P>
<P>Not compelled me, Sir! Did not my father kneel to me? My mother's eyes &s;poke more than her lips
<PB N="120" REF="121">
<HI>could</HI> have uttered. The Bi&s;hop had influenced good Father Mare&s;cotti (again&s;t the intere&s;ts of Religion, I had almo&s;t &s;aid) to oppo&s;e the wi&s;h of my heart. Je|ronymo, your Jeronymo, gave into their mea&s;ures: What refuge had I?&mdash;Our Glacomo was inexorable. I was to be met on my return from Florence to Bo|logna, by the Count of Belvedere, and all tho&s;e of his hou&s;e; the General was to be in his company: I had &s;ecret intelligence of all this: And I was to be received as an actual bride at Bologna, or made to promi&s;e I would be &s;o within a few days after my ar|rival. My Si&s;ter-in-law, my only advocate among my Italian friends, pitied me, it is true: But, for that rea&s;on, &s;he was not to be allowed to come to Bolog|na. I was at other times denied to go to Urbino, to Rome, to Naples&mdash;<HI>Could</HI> I do otherwi&s;e than I have done, if I would avoid pro&s;aning a Sacrament?</P>
<P>My deare&s;t &s;i&s;ter Clementina <HI>&s;ometimes</HI> accu&s;es <HI>her|&s;elf</HI> of ra&s;hne&s;s, for taking a &s;tep &s;o extraordinary. At this moment, does &s;he not receive her brother in darkne&s;s? Whence this &s;weet <HI>con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s?</HI> But what is done <HI>is</HI> done. Your Con&s;cience is a Law to you, who &s;hall condemn?&mdash;Let us look forward, madam. I approve not of the vehemence of your friends per|&s;ua&s;ions. Yet what parents ever meant a child more indulgence; what brothers, a &s;i&s;ter more di&s;intere&s;t|ed affection?</P>
<P>I own, &s;ir, that my heart at times mi&s;gives me. But an&s;wer me this: Are you of opinion that I ought, at the in&s;tance of my parents and brothers, however affectionate, however indulgent in all other in&s;tances, to marry again&s;t inclination, again&s;t ju&s;tice, again&s;t con&s;cience?</P>
<P>Again&s;t any one of the&s;e you ought not.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, then I will endeavour to make my&s;elf ea&s;y as to this article. But will you undertake, Sir, (A woman wants a protector) to maintain this argu|ment for me?</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="122">
I will, madam, and &s;hall hope for the more &s;uc|ce&s;s, if you will promi&s;e to lay a&s;ide all thoughts of the veil.</P>
<P>Ah, Chevalier!</P>
<P>Will my deare&s;t Si&s;ter an&s;wer me one que&s;tion? Is it not your hope, that by re&s;i&s;ting their wi&s;hes, you may tire out oppo&s;ition, and at la&s;t bring your friends to con&s;ent to a mea&s;ure to which they have always been extremely aver&s;e?</P>
<P>Ah, Chevalier!&mdash;But if I could get them to con|&s;ent&mdash;</P>
<P>Dear madam! is not <HI>their</HI> rea&s;oning the &s;ame&mdash;If they could get <HI>you</HI> to con&s;ent?</P>
<P>Ah, Chevalier!</P>
<P>May not this be a contention for months, for years? And&mdash;</P>
<P>I know, Sir, your inference: You think that in a contention between parents and child, the child &s;hould yield. Is not that your inference?</P>
<P>Not again&s;t rea&s;on, again&s;t ju&s;tice, again&s;t <HI>con&s;cience.</HI> But there may be ca&s;es, in which <HI>neither</HI> ought to be their own judge.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, you that have yielded to a plea of con|&s;cience (God <HI>has</HI> ble&s;&s;ed you, and may God <HI>continue</HI> to ble&s;s you, for it!)</P>
<P>Admirable Clementina!</P>
<P>&mdash;Are fit to be a judge between us&mdash;You &s;hall be mine, if ever the debate be brought on.</P>
<P>No con&s;ideration, in that ca&s;e, &s;hall bias me!&mdash;But may I not hope, that the dear Lady I &s;tand before, will permit me to behold a per&s;on, who&s;e mind I ever revered?</P>
<P>Laura, &s;aid &s;he, let the tea be got ready: I have been taught to drink tea, Sir, &s;ince my arrival. The gentlewoman of the hou&s;e is very obliging. Permit me, Sir, to withdraw for a few moments.</P>
<P>She &s;ighed as &s;he went out, leaning upon Laura.</P>
<P>Laura returned &s;oon after with lights. She &s;et them
<PB N="122" REF="123">
on the table; and giving way to a violent emotion, O my lord Grandi&s;on, &s;aid the poor girl, falling down, and embracing my knees: For the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin's &s;ake, prevail on my Lady to return to dear, dear Bo|logna!</P>
<P>Have patience, Laura: All will be well.</P>
<P>I, the unhappy Laura, &s;hall be the &s;acrifice. The General will kill me&mdash;O that I had never accompa|nied my Lady in this expedition!</P>
<P>Have patience, Laura! If you have behaved well to your Lady, I will take you into my protection. Had you a good voyage? Was the ma&s;ter of the ve&s;|&s;el, were his officers, obliging?</P>
<P>They were, Sir; or neither my Lady or I &s;hould have been now living. O Sir, we were in a dying way all the voyage; except the three la&s;t days of it. The ma&s;ter was the civille&s;t of men.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked after her fellow-&s;ervant, naming him from Jeronymo's Letters. Gone out, was the an&s;wer, to buy &s;ome nece&s;&s;aries! O Sir, we live a &s;ad life! Strangers to the language, to the cu&s;toms of the country, all our dependence is upon this young man.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked her after the behaviour and character of the people of the hou&s;e (a widow and her three daughters) that if I heard but an indifferent account of them, I might enforce by it my intended plea to get her to Lady L's. Laura &s;poke well of them. The Captain of the ve&s;&s;el who brought them over, is related to them, and recommended them, when he knew what part of the town her Lady cho&s;e.</P>
<P>What ri&s;ques did the poor Lady run! Such different people as &s;he had to deal with, in the contrivance and pro&s;ecution of her wild &s;cheme; yet all to prove hone&s;t! how happy! Poor Lady! how ready was &s;he to fly from what &s;he apprehended to be the neare&s;t evil! But &s;he could not be in a capacity to weigh the dangers to which &s;he expo&s;ed her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Often and often, &s;aid Laura, have I, on my knees,
<PB N="123" REF="124">
be&s;ought my Lady to write to you. But &s;he was not always well enough to re&s;olve <HI>what</HI> to do; and when &s;he was &s;edate, &s;he would plead, that &s;he was afraid to &s;ee you: You would be very angry with her: You would condemn her as a ra&s;h creature: And &s;he could not bear your di&s;plea&s;ure: She was con&s;cious that the act &s;he had done, bore a ra&s;h, and even a romantic, appearance: Had you been in town, Antony &s;hould have made enquiries at di&s;tance, and &s;he might have yielded to &s;ee you: But for &s;everal days her thoughts were not enough compo&s;ed to write to you. At la&s;t, being impatient to hear of the health of her father and mother, &s;he <HI>did</HI> write.</P>
<P>Why &s;tays &s;he &s;o long from me, Laura? Attend your Lady, and tell her, that I beg the honour of her pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Laura went to her. Her Lady pre&s;ented her&s;elf with an air of ba&s;hful dignity. I met her at her en|trance&mdash;My Si&s;ter, my Friend, my <HI>deare&s;t</HI> Lady Cle|mentina, ki&s;&s;ing her hand, welcome, welcome, I re|peat, to England. Behold your fourth Brother, your Protector: Honour me with your confidence: Ac|knowlege my protection. <HI>Your</HI> honour, <HI>your</HI> happi|ne&s;s, is dear to me as my life.</P>
<P>I led her trembling, &s;ighing, but at the moment &s;peechle&s;s, to a &s;eat, and &s;at down by her, holding both her hands in mine: She &s;truggled for &s;peech: Compo&s;e your&s;elf, madam: A&s;&s;ure your&s;elf of my tendere&s;t regard, of my true&s;t brotherly affection.</P>
<P>Generous Grandi&s;on! <HI>Can</HI> you forgive me? Can you from your <HI>heart</HI> bid me welcome? <HI>I will endea|vour</HI> to compo&s;e my&s;elf. You told me I was con|&s;cious: Con&s;cious indeed I am: The &s;tep I have taken has a di&s;graceful appearance: But yet will I not con|demn, nor con&s;ent that <HI>you</HI> &s;hould, my motive.</P>
<P>I condemn not your <HI>motive,</HI> madam. All <HI>will,</HI> all <HI>mu&s;t,</HI> be happy! Rely on my brotherly advice and protection. My Si&s;ters, and their lords, every one I
<PB N="124" REF="125">
love, admires you. You are come to families of Lovers, who will think them&s;elves honoured by your confidence.</P>
<P>You pour balm into the wounds of my mind. What is woman when difficulties &s;urround her! When it was too late, and the &s;hip that I embarked in was under &s;ail, then began my terror: <HI>That</HI> took away from me all power of countermanding the orders I had given; till the winds that favoured my voyage, oppo&s;ed my return. Then was I afraid to tru&s;t my|&s;elf with my own reflexions, le&s;t, if I gave way to them, my former malady &s;hould find me out. But let me not make <HI>you</HI> unhappy. Yet, permit me to ob&s;erve, that when you mentioned the kind reception I might expect to meet with, among your friends, you forbore to mention the principal per&s;on&mdash;What will SHE think of the poor Clementina? But be a&s;|&s;ured, and a&s;&s;ure <HI>her,</HI> That I would not have &s;et my foot on the Engli&s;h &s;hore, had you <HI>not</HI> been married. O Chevalier! if I make you and her unhappy, no creature on earth can hate me &s;o much as I &s;hall hate my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Generous, noble Clementina!&mdash;Your happine&s;s is indeed e&s;&s;ential to that of us <HI>both.</HI> My Harriet is another Clementina! You are another Harriet! <HI>Si&s;ter</HI>-excellencies I have called you to her, to all her rela|tions. In the Letter you favoured me with, you wi&s;hed to know her: You <HI>mu&s;t</HI> know her; and I am &s;ure you will love her. Your wi&s;hes that &s;he would accept of my vows, were motives with her to make me happy. She knows our whole hi&s;tory. She is prepared to receive you, as the deare&s;t of her &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>Generous Lady Grandi&s;on! I have heard her cha|racter. I congratulate you, Sir. You have rea&s;on to think, that I &s;hould have been grieved, had you not met with a woman who de&s;erved you. To know you are happy in a wife, and think your&s;elf &s;o, that no blame lies upon me for declining your addre&s;&s;es,
<PB N="125" REF="126">
will contribute more than I can expre&s;s, to my peace of mind. When I have more courage, and my heart is ea&s;ed of &s;ome part of its angui&s;h, you &s;hall pre&s;ent me to her. Tell her, mean time, that I will love her; and that I &s;hall hold my&s;elf everla&s;tingly bound to her in gratitude, for making happy the man, whom once, but for a &s;uperior motive, I had the vanity to think I could have made &s;o.</P>
<P>She turned away her glowing face, tears on her cheek. My admiration of her greatne&s;s of mind, &s;o &s;imilar to that of my own Harriet, would not allow me to pour out my heart in words. I aro&s;e; and, take|ing both her hands, bowed upon them. Tears more plentifully flowed from her averted eyes; and we were both for one moment &s;peechle&s;s.</P>
<P>It would be injurious to a mind equally great and noble as that which informs the per&s;on of this your Si&s;ter-excellence, to offer to apologize for faithfully relating to you tho&s;e tender emotions of hearts, one of them not le&s;s pure than my Harriet's, the other all your own.</P>
<P>I broke &s;ilence, and urged her to accept of apart|ments at Lady L's. Let me acquaint the gentle|woman of the hou&s;e, I be&s;eech you, madam, that to-morrow morning the &s;i&s;ter I have named, and I, will attend you to her hou&s;e. We will thank her <HI>for you,</HI> as you have almo&s;t forgotten your Engli&s;h, for the civilities which &s;he and her daughters have &s;hewn you: And I will make it my bu&s;ine&s;s to find out the hone&s;t Captain, who, Laura tells me, has been very civil to you al&s;o, and thank him too in the names of all our common friends, for his care of you.</P>
<P>I will think my&s;elf honoured, now you have en|couraged me to look up, by a vi&s;it from either or both your &s;i&s;ters. But let me advi&s;e with you, Sir, is the kind offer you make me, a proper offer for me to accept of? I &s;hall be ready to take your advice&mdash;Little regard as I may &s;eem, by the &s;tep I have taken,
<PB N="126" REF="127">
to have had for my own honour; I would avoid, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;uffering a fir&s;t error to draw me into a &s;e|cond. Do you Sir, as my brother and friend, take care of that honour in every &s;tep you &s;hall advi&s;e me to take.</P>
<P>Your honour, madam, &s;hall be my fir&s;t care. I &s;incerely think this is the righte&s;t mea&s;ure you can now pur&s;ue.</P>
<P><HI>Now</HI> pur&s;ue!&mdash;&s;ighing.</P>
<P>This argument admitted of a &s;hort debate. She was &s;crupulous from motives too narrow for a Cle|mentina to mention. I made her blu&s;h for mention|ing them; and, in &s;hort, had the happine&s;s to con|vince her, that the protection of the &s;i&s;ter of her fourth brother was the mo&s;t proper &s;he could choo&s;e.</P>
<P>I went down, and talked to the gentlewomen be|low. They were plea&s;ed with what I &s;aid to them. They prayed for the Lady and her family, and for a happy reconciliation between them; for Antony had given them briefly her &s;tory.</P>
<P>I reque&s;ted them to make my compliments to her relation Captain Hender&s;on, and de&s;ire him to give me an opportunity to thank him in per&s;on for his ci|vility to a Lady beloved by all who have the honour of knowing her.</P>
<P>I went up again to the Lady; and &s;at with her mo&s;t of the evening, Laura only attending us.</P>
<P>I talked to Clementina of Mrs. Beaumont, and the Ladies at Florence; and intimated, that her mother had prevailed on that Lady to come to England, in hopes, as &s;he is an Engli&s;h woman, that her company would be highly acceptable to her. She ble&s;&s;ed her mother! What an in&s;tance of forgiving goodne&s;s was this! &s;he &s;aid, with tears of gratitude; and ble&s;&s;ed Mrs. Beaumont for <HI>her</HI> goodne&s;s to her; and the Ladies at Florence for parting with one &s;o dear to them.</P>
<P>I was happy throughout this latter conver&s;ation in
<PB N="127" REF="128">
her &s;erenity; not one in&s;tance of wandering did I ob|&s;erve.</P>
<P>I cho&s;e not, however, &s;o early, to acquaint her, with the intention of the deare&s;t and neare&s;t of her friends, to come over with Mrs. Beaumont; tho' I expre&s;&s;ed my earne&s;t hope, that if we could make England agreeable to her, I &s;hould have the honour of the promi&s;ed vi&s;it from &s;ome of the principals of her family, before &s;he left it.</P>
<P>This, my deare&s;t Life, is a minute account of our interview. One of the greate&s;t Plea&s;ures I <HI>can</HI> know is to obey the gentle, the generous commands of my Harriet.</P>
<P>This morning I attended Lady L. to breakfa&s;t with the excellent Lady, as propo&s;ed. My Si&s;ter and her Lord are charmed with their gue&s;t: Their gue&s;t &s;he <HI>is:</HI> And Lady Clementina is as much plea&s;ed with them. She is every hour more and more &s;en&s;ible of the danger &s;he has run; and cen&s;ures her&s;elf very freely for the <HI>ra&s;h</HI> &s;tep, as &s;he calls it her&s;elf.</P>
<P>She longs, yet is a&s;hamed to &s;ee you, my deare&s;t life; and li&s;tens with delight to the prai&s;es my Lord and Lady L. &s;o ju&s;tly give to my Harriet.</P>

<P>WE are as happy here, as we can expect to be; Lady Clementina in her &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e and apprehen&s;ion; I without my Harriet.</P>
<P>You hinted to me once, my Love, &s;omething of our Beauchamp's regard for Emily. He ju&s;t now, after more he&s;itations than I expected from my friend, opened his heart to me, and a&s;ked me to countenance his addre&s;&s;es to her. I chid him for his he&s;itation&mdash;and then &s;aid, Is my Beauchamp in this propo&s;ition &s;o right as he generally is?&mdash;Emily, tho' tall and womanly, is very young. I am not a friend to <HI>very</HI> early marriages. You know as well as any man, my dear friend, the rea&s;ons that may be urged again&s;t &s;uch. Methinks I would give Emily an opportunity, as well for her hu&s;band's &s;ake, whoever &s;hall be the man, as for her own, to look round her, and make her own choice. The merit of Sir Edward Beauchamp, his per&s;onal accompli&s;hments, and character, to &s;ay nothing of his now ample fortune, mu&s;t make his addre&s;&s;es to <HI>any</HI> woman acceptable. You would not, I pre&s;ume, think of marrying her, if you might, till &s;he is eighteen or twenty: And would my Beauchamp fetter him&s;elf, by engagements to a girl; and leave <HI>her</HI> who at pre&s;ent can hardly give him the preference he de&s;erves, no chance of choo&s;ing for her&s;elf, when at woman's e&s;tate?</P>
<P>He waved the di&s;cour&s;e; and left me without re|&s;uming it. I am grieved, on recollection; for I am afraid he is not &s;atisfied with me, for what I &s;aid.</P>
<P>My deare&s;t Life, you mu&s;t advi&s;e me. I will not take any important &s;tep, whether relative to my&s;elf or friends, but by your advice, and, if you plea&s;e, Dr. Barlett's. Whenever heretofore I have had time to
<PB N="129" REF="130">
take that good man's, I have been &s;ure of the ground I &s;tood upon. His has been of infinite &s;ervice to me, as you have heard me often acknowlege. Yours and his, will e&s;tabli&s;h my judgment in every ca&s;e: But in this of Emily's, <HI>yours,</HI> my dear, for obvious rea&s;ons, I mu&s;t prefer even to <HI>his.</HI> In the mean time I will &s;eek Beauchamp. He &s;hall not be angry with his Grandi&s;on!&mdash;But, good young man! Can it be, that he is really in love with &s;uch a girl as to years?</P>
<P>This I <HI>dare</HI> &s;ay; Beauchamp's principal regard can|not be to her fortune: His e&s;tate is unincumbered. I &s;hould think my&s;elf, as well as Emily, happy, and that I had performed all my duty by her, were I to marry her to &s;uch a man. But, methinks I want him to be <HI>&s;ooner</HI> married, than I &s;hould wi&s;h my Emily to be a wife. I think you told me, that Emily at pre|&s;ent has not thoughts of him&mdash;But you, my dear, mu&s;t advi&s;e me.</P>

<P>SIR Edward has ju&s;t left me. He a&s;ked my excu&s;e for having mentioned the above &s;ubject to me. It is at pre&s;ent in your power, Sir Charles, &s;aid he, to &s;i|lence me upon it for ever. It might not have been &s;o &s;ome time hence. I thought, therefore, on examin|ing the &s;tate of my heart, it was but honourable to open it to you. Forbid me this moment to think of her, and I will endeavour to obey her guardian.</P>
<P>My dear friend! You know Emily's Age&mdash;Would you willingly&mdash;I &s;topt that he might &s;peak.</P>
<P>Stay for her? I would, Sir Charles, till you and &s;he&mdash;He pa&s;&s;ed&mdash;Then re&s;uming: My Love for her is not an intere&s;ted Love. I would, if I might have your permi&s;&s;ion to make my addre&s;&s;es to her (and that &s;hould be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> hone&s;t a&s;&s;iduities, before declaration) be wholly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> by your advice for the good of both I would make your conduct to Lady Clemen|tina,
<PB N="130" REF="131">
when you la&s;t went over, my pattern. <HI>I</HI> would be bound, <HI>&s;he</HI> &s;hould be free. I never would be &s;o mean as to endeavour to engage her by promi&s;es to me. My pride will &s;et her free, whenever I perceive &s;he balances in favour of another man.</P>
<P>But what, my excellent friend, &s;hall we do? Can you conde&s;cend to court <HI>two</HI> women, Emily &s;o young, for her <HI>di&s;tant</HI> con&s;ent?</P>
<P>What means Sir Charles Grandi&s;on?</P>
<P>I will read to you without re&s;erve, what I had ju&s;t written to my Harriet, on this topic; reciting to her, what pa&s;&s;ed in the conver&s;ation between you and me, a little while ago.</P>
<P>I read to him accordingly, what I wrote to you, my deare&s;t Love. He heard me with great attention, not interrupting me once (nor did I interrupt my&s;elf); no not by apologies for the freedom of my thoughts, on the &s;ubject. And when I had done, he wrung my hand, and thanked me for my unre&s;ervedne&s;s, in terms worthy of our mutual friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, my dear Sir Edward, &s;aid I, how I am circum&s;tanced: What I have promi&s;ed to my wife, is a Law to me, prudence and after-events not con|trouling. She loves Emily: She has a high regard for you. Women know women. Go hand in hand with her. I will &s;ave you the trouble of referring to me, in the progre&s;s of your application to my wife and Emily. My Harriet will acquaint me with what is nece&s;&s;ary for me, as Emily's guardian, to know. I build on your hint of a&s;&s;iduities, in preference to an early declaration. <HI>You,</HI> my Beauchamp, need not be afraid of giving time to a young creature to look round her. Let me add, that Emily &s;hall give &s;igns of pre|ferring you to all men, as I expect from you demon|&s;trations of your preferring her to all women; or I &s;hall make a difficulty, for both your &s;akes, of giving a guardian's con&s;ent: And remember al&s;o, that Emi|ly has a mother; who, tho' &s;he has not greatly me|rited
<PB N="131" REF="132">
con&s;ideration, <HI>is</HI> her mother. We mu&s;t do <HI>our</HI> duty you know, my Beauchamp, in the common re|lations of life, whether <HI>others</HI> do theirs or not. But the addre&s;s of a man of your credit and con&s;equence cannot give you any difficulty there, when that of Mi&s;s Jervois's tender years is got over.</P>
<P>He was plea&s;ed with what I &s;aid. I a&s;ked him, if he approved of her motion to go down with Mrs. Sel|by and Lucy? Highly, he &s;aid; and as it came from her&s;elf, he thought it an in&s;tance of prudence in her, that few young creatures would have been able to &s;hew.</P>
<P>In&s;tance of prudence! my Love! How &s;o! When, wi&s;e as our Northampton&s;hire relations are, Emily would have wanted to benefit that her choice can give her, were &s;he to remain with us, in the in&s;truc|tions and example of my Harriet.&mdash;But, my dear Life, does Emily hold her mind to attend Mrs. Selby and Lucy into Northampton&s;hire? Let it be with her whole heart.</P>
<P>My cou&s;in Grandi&s;on believes him&s;elf to be very happy. His wife, he &s;ays, thinks her&s;elf the happie&s;t of women I am glad of it. She has a greater opi|nion of his under&s;tanding, than &s;he has of her own: This &s;eems to be nece&s;&s;ary to the happine&s;s of com|mon minds in wedlock. He is gay, fluttering, debon|naire; and &s;he thinks tho&s;e qualities appendages of <HI>fa|mily.</HI> He has pre&s;ented her with a genealogical table of his ance&s;tors, drawn up and blazoned by heraldry art. It is framed, glazed, and hung up in her draw|ing-room. She &s;hews it to every one. Perhaps &s;he thinks it nece&s;&s;ary to apologize, by that means, to all her vi&s;iters, for be&s;towing her per&s;on and fortune on a ruined man. But what, in a nation, the glory and &s;trength of which are trade and commerce, is genti|lity! What even nobility, where de&s;cendants depart from the virtue of the fir&s;t enobling ance&s;tor!</P>
<P>Lord and Lady G. have invited Lady Clementina to dinner to-morrow. She has had the goodne&s;s to
<PB N="132" REF="133">
accept of the Invitation. Lord and Lady L. and my aunt Grandi&s;on, will attend her.</P>
<P>What, my dear, makes Charlotte &s;o impatient (&s;o petulant I had almo&s;t &s;aid) under a circum&s;tance, which, if attended with a happy i&s;&s;ue, will lay all us, her friends, under obligation to her? I a&s;ked once my Harriet, if Lord G. were as happy in a wife, as Char|lotte is in a hu&s;band? You returned me not a direct an&s;wer. I was afraid of repeating my que&s;tion, be|cau&s;e I knew you would have chearfully an&s;wered it, could you have done it to my wi&s;hes. I &s;ee in my Lord's behaviour to her, re&s;pect and affection even to fondne&s;s; but not the polite familiarity that becomes a wedded Love. Let her pre&s;ent circum&s;tance be hap|pily over, and &s;he will find her brother's eye a more ob&s;ervant one, than hitherto &s;he has found it. But be not, my dear over-&s;olicitous for the friend you &s;o greatly value: True brotherly Love &s;hall ever hold the principal &s;eat in my heart, when I &s;it in judgment upon a &s;i&s;ter's conduct.</P>
<P>My fond heart throbs in expectation of &s;oon pre|&s;enting a Si&s;ter to each of the two noble&s;t women on earth. Allow for the perplexity of Clementina's mind; and for the impolitic urgency of her friends; and you will not, when you &s;ee her, &s;cruple to hold out to a Si&s;ter-excellence, not happily &s;ituated, the hand that ble&s;&s;ed</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Sat. Feb. <HI>24.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE arrival of the Leghorn-frigate is every day expected. The merchants have intelligence, that it put in at Antibes. If the journey by land from
<PB N="133" REF="134">
thence to Paris, and &s;o to Calais, could be made fa|vourable to my dear friend Jeronymo, I have no doubt but our expected gue&s;ts landed there, at this &s;ea&s;on of the year, &s;o unpropitious to tender pa&s;&s;engers.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e in Gro&s;venor-&s;quare is now, thanks to good Lord G. quite ready for their reception. There will be room, I believe, as they propo&s;e to be here incognito, and with only nece&s;&s;ary attendants, for the Marquis and his Lady, for Mrs. Beaumont (who will be both their comforter and interpreter) for the two Brothers, and Father Mare&s;cotti. Saunders has alrea|dy procured hand&s;ome lodgings for the Count of Bel|vedere. I wi&s;h with you, my Love, that the Count were not to accompany them. The poor Lady mu&s;t not know it, if it can be avoided. The two young Lords, whom I invited when I was in Italy, mu&s;t be more immediately our own gue&s;ts, if my deare&s;t Life has no objection.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;ure your&s;elf, my generous Harriet, that the Lady &s;hall not be either compelled, or too urgently per&s;uaded, if I have weight with the family when they arrive. They &s;hall not know where &s;he is, nor &s;ee her, but by her own con&s;ent, and as I &s;ee their di&s;po|&s;ition to receive her as I wi&s;h. Excellent creature! what a noble &s;olicitude is yours for her tranquillity of mind!</P>
<P>I have not yet been able to break to her the daily expectation I have of &s;eeing in England her parents and brothers: Yet am unea&s;y, that &s;he knows it not. I want courage, my Harriet, to acquaint her with it. I have more than once e&s;&s;ayed to do it. Dear crea|ture! &s;he looks with &s;o much innocence, and &s;o much reliance upon me; and is, at times, &s;o appre|hen&s;ive!&mdash;I know not how to break it to her.</P>
<P>She depends upon my mediation. She urges me to begin a treaty of reconciliation with them. I defer writing, I tell her, till I have &s;een Mrs. Beaumont.
<PB N="134" REF="135">
Little does &s;he think they are upon their journey, and that I know not where to direct to them. She longs for Mrs. Beaumont's arrival; and hopes, &s;he &s;ays, &s;he will bring with her the poor Camilla, that &s;he may have an opportunity to obtain her excu&s;e for the har&s;h treatment &s;he gave her: And yet Camilla, &s;aid &s;he, was a teazing woman.</P>
<P>Were you ever &s;en&s;ible, my Harriet, of the tender pain that an open heart (yours is an open and an en|larged one) feels; longing, yet, for its friend's &s;ake, afraid, to reveal unwelcome tidings, which, however, it imports the concerned to know? How loth to di&s;|turb the tranquillity which is built upon ignorance of the event! Yet that every tranquillity (contemplated upon) adding to the pain of the compa&s;&s;ionating friend; who reflects, that when the unhappy news &s;hall be revealed, Time, and Chri&s;tian philo&s;ophy, only, will ever re&s;tore it to the heart of the &s;ufferer!</P>
<P>Lord and Lady L. are endeavouring to divert their too thoughtful gue&s;t by carrying her to &s;ee what they think will either entertain or amu&s;e her. To-mor|row (Lady L. contributing to the dear Lady's proper appearance there) they purpo&s;e to attend her to the drawing-room. But hitherto &s;he &s;eems not to have a very high opinion of the country. If her heart could be ea&s;y, every thing would have a different appear|ance to her.</P>
<P>I HAVE this moment the favour of yours of ye&s;ter|day. If our kind friends <HI>will</HI> &s;tay no longer with you at the Hall, do you, my deare&s;t Love, as you propo&s;e, accompany them up. They are extremely obliging in propo&s;ing to give me here two or three days of their company, before they return to North|hampton&s;hire.</P>
<P><HI>My con&s;ent,</HI> my Harriet!&mdash;Why, if you have a choice of your own, do you a&s;k it? I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> approve of whatever you wi&s;h to do. Could I have been cer|tain,
<PB N="135" REF="136">
I would have met my Love. But you will have many dear friends with you.</P>
<P>Tell my Emily, that I have had a vi&s;it from her Mother and Mr. O-Hara; and was &s;o much plea&s;ed with them, that I propo&s;e on Monday to return their vi&s;it at their own lodgings.</P>
<P>Now I know I am to be &s;oon ble&s;&s;ed with the pre|&s;ence of my Harriet, I have given way to all my wi&s;hes: One of them is, Never to be &s;eparated from the joy of my heart. Such, I tru&s;t, will &s;he ever be, to</P>

<P>AGAIN, my ever-honoured grandmamma, does your Harriet re&s;ume the pen. Lucy and my aunt, between them, have given you an account of every-thing that pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince my la&s;t.</P>
<P>We arrived la&s;t night. With what tenderne&s;s did the be&s;t of men, and of hu&s;bands, receive his Harriet, and her friends!</P>
<P>This afternoon, at tea, I am to be pre&s;ented to Lady Clementina at Lord L's. Don't you believe my heart throbs with expectation? Indeed it does. Sir Charles &s;ays, <HI>her</HI> emotions are as great on the occa|&s;ion.</P>
<P>What honour does my dear Sir Charles do to his Harriet! He con&s;ults her, as if he doubted his own judgment, and wanted to have it confirmed by hers. What happine&s;s is hers, who marries a <HI>good</HI> man! Such a one will do obliging things for principle's &s;ake: He will pity involuntary failings: He will do ju&s;tice to
<PB N="136" REF="137">
good intentions, and give importance to all his fellow|creatures; becau&s;e he knows they and he are equally creatures of the almighty. What woman, who <HI>thinks,</HI> but will prefer a <HI>good</HI> man to all others, however di&s;tingui&s;hed by rank, fortune, or per&s;on? But my Sir Charles is a good man, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by all tho&s;e advantages. What a creature &s;hould I be, ble&s;&s;ed with a hu&s;band of a heart &s;o faithful, and &s;o well|principled, if I were not able to let my Love and compa&s;&s;ion flow to a Clementina, tho' once (and in|deed <HI>for</HI> that very rea&s;on) the only beloved of his heart!&mdash;Why are not <HI>real</HI> calls made upon me, to convince &s;uch a man, that I have a mind emulative of his own, at lea&s;t of Clementina's? The woman who, from motives of Religion, having the heart of a Sir Charles Grandi&s;on in her hand, loving him above all earthly creatures, and all her friends con&s;enting, could refu&s;e him her vows, mu&s;t be, in that act, the greate&s;t, the mo&s;t magnanimous, of women. But could the noble Lady have thus acted, my dear grandmamma, had not &s;he been &s;timulated by that glorious En|thu&s;ia&s;m, of which her di&s;turbed imagination had &s;hewn &s;ome previous tokens; and which, rightly di|rected, has heretofore given the palm of martyrdom to Saints?</P>
<P>WE have ju&s;t now been welcomed to town by Sir Edward Beauchamp. Sir Charles, on pre&s;enting him to me, thus expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf: You remember, my deare&s;t Life, what I wrote to you of the la&s;t part of the conver&s;ation between Sir Edward and me, in re|lation to my Emily. Your prudence, my Harriet, and love of the good girl; your di&s;cretion and genero&s;ity, Sir Edward; will join you together as coun&s;ellors and advi&s;ers of your Grandi&s;on. My Wife and my Friend cannot err in this in&s;tance, becau&s;e you will both con&s;ider what belongs to the characters of a Guardian, and a Ward &s;o beloved by you both; and, if you doubt, have Dr. Bartlett at hand.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="138">
My uncle, and aunt Lucy, are determined to &s;et out next Wedne&s;day for Northampton&s;hire. Sir Ed|ward de&s;ired to know of Sir Charles, If he had any objection to his attending them down? None at all, &s;urely, was Sir Charles's an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Mr. Deane accompanies them, in order to adju&s;t &s;ome matters at Peterborough, preparative to the fa|vour he does us of &s;ettling with us or near us, for the remainder of his days. May that remainder be long and happy!</P>
<P>Sir Charles a&s;ked Emily ju&s;t now, If &s;he held her mind, as to going down? Indeed &s;he did, &s;he &s;aid: Her heart was in it; and &s;he would go that in&s;tant to acquaint her mother with her intention, and to buy &s;ome things preparatory to her journey: She &s;hould take it for a great favour, &s;he told Lucy, if &s;he would go with her on both occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Lucy has made to her&s;elf a great intere&s;t in Emily's heart. They are both &s;ure they &s;hall be happy in each other. My aunt loves her: So does my uncle. Who does not? I am &s;ure <HI>you</HI> will, my dear grand|mamma, and pity her too. Dear pretty &s;oul! She co&s;ts me now and then a tear. But had I not been in her way, it would have been wor&s;e. She could have no hope: I am &s;ure &s;he knows &s;he could not. But what a &s;ad gradation is there in that Love, which, tho' begun in hopele&s;ne&s;s of &s;ucceeding, ri&s;es by &s;elf|flattery, to a po&s;&s;ibility, then to probability, to <HI>hope;</HI> and, &s;inking again to <HI>hopele&s;ne&s;s,</HI> ends in de&s;pair!&mdash;But how coolly I write on, for one who is by-and-by to &s;ee a Clementina!</P>
<P>I AM waiting Sir Charles's kind lei&s;ure to carry me to Lady L's. He has Mr. Lowther with him ju&s;t now; who, however, finding us engaged, will not &s;tay.</P>
<P>Sir Charles approved my dre&s;s, <HI>as</HI> he pa&s;&s;ed by me to go to Mr. Lowther in the &s;tudy. He &s;natched my hand, and pre&s;&s;ed it with his lips: My ever-lovely,
<PB N="138" REF="139">
my ever-con&s;iderate Harriet&punc; you want no ornaments: But I was &s;ure you would not give your&s;elf any but tho&s;e that flowed from a compa&s;&s;ionate and generous heart, when you were to vi&s;it a Lady who at pre&s;ent is not in happy circum&s;tances; yet is intitled by me|rit, as well as rank, to be in the happie&s;t.</P>
<P>My aunt and Lucy long for my return, to have an account of the Lady&punc; and what pa&s;&s;es between us. How my heart&mdash;What is the matter with my heart?</P>

<P>LADY Clementina, my deare&s;t grandmamma&punc; mu&s;t not, &s;hall not, be compelled. If I admired, if I loved her before <HI>now</HI> that I have &s;een her, that I have conver&s;ed with her, I love, I admire her, if po&s;&s;ible, ten times more. She is really, in her per|&s;on, a lovely woman, of middle &s;tature; extremely genteel: An air of dignity, even of grandeur, ap|pears in her a&s;pect, and in all &s;he &s;ays and does: Her complexion is fine without art: Indeed &s;he is a lovely woman! She has the fine&s;t black eye, hair, eyebrows of the &s;ame colour, I ever &s;aw; yet has &s;ometimes a wildi&s;h ca&s;t with her eye, &s;ometimes a languor, that, when one knows her &s;tory, reminds one that her head has been di&s;turbed. Why, taking advantage of her Sex, is &s;uch a per&s;on to be controul|ed, and treated as if &s;he were not to have a will; when &s;he has an under&s;tanding, perhaps, &s;uperior to that of either of her <HI>wilful</HI> brothers?</P>
<P>When we alighted at Lady L's, I begged Sir Charles to conduct me into any apartment but that where &s;he was. I &s;at down on the fir&s;t &s;eat. Lady L. ha&s;tened to me&mdash;My deare&s;t &s;i&s;ter, you &s;eem di&s;ordered&mdash;Fie!&mdash;Lady Grandi&s;on, and want &s;pirits!</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="140">
Sir Charles (not ob&s;erving my emotion) had left me; and went to attend Lady Clementina. She, it &s;eems, was in &s;ome di&s;order. My Harriet (&s;aid he to her, as he told me afterwards) attends the com|mands of her Si&s;ter-excellence.</P>
<P>Call me not <HI>Excellence!</HI> Call me not her <HI>Si&s;ter!</HI> Am I not a fugitive in her eye, in every-body's eye?&mdash;I think, Chevalier, I cannot &s;ee her. She will <HI>look down</HI> upon me. I think I am as much afraid to &s;ee her, as I was at fir&s;t to &s;ee you. Is there &s;everity in her virtue?</P>
<P>She is all goodne&s;s, all &s;weetne&s;s, madam. Did I not tell you, that &s;he is the Clementina of England?</P>
<P>Well, Sir, you are very good. Don't let me be unpolite. I am but a gue&s;t in this ho&s;pitable hou&s;e&mdash;El&s;e I would have attended her at the fir&s;t door. Is &s;he not Lady Grandi&s;on? Happy, happy woman!</P>
<P>Tears were in her eyes. She turned away to hide them. Then &s;tepping forward; I am now prepared to receive her: Pray, Sir, introduce me.</P>
<P>She is not without <HI>her</HI> emotions, madam&mdash;She is preparing her&s;elf to &s;ee you. Love, compa&s;&s;ion, for Lady Clementina, fills her bo&s;om&mdash;I will pre&s;ent her to <HI>you.</HI></P>
<P>Lady L. went to her. Sir Charles came to me.&mdash;My deare&s;t Love, why this concern? You will &s;ee a woman you <HI>cannot</HI> fear, but mu&s;t <HI>love.</HI> She has been in the like agitations&mdash;Favour me with your hand.</P>
<P>No, Sir&mdash;That would be to in&s;ult her.</P>
<P>My deare&s;t Life! forget not your own dignity [I &s;tarted]; nor give <HI>me</HI> too much con&s;equence with a Lady, who, like your&s;elf, is all Soul. I glory in my wife: I cannot de&s;ert my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I was a little awed at the time; but the moment I got home, and was alone with him, I acknowledged his goodne&s;s and greatne&s;s, both in one.</P>
<P>He led me in. Lady L. only (at Sir Charles's re|que&s;t, for both our &s;akes) was pre&s;ent. The noble
<PB N="140" REF="141">
Lady approached me. I ha&s;tened to meet her, with trembling feet. Sir Charles, ki&s;&s;ing a hand of each, joined them together. Si&s;ter-excellencies, I have of|ten called you! Deare&s;t of women, love each other, as I admire you both.</P>
<P>She threw her arms about my neck: Receive, O receive, to your Love, to your Friend&s;hip, a poor de|&s;olate! Till within the&s;e few days, a de&s;olate indeed! a fugitive! a rebellious! an ingrate to the be&s;t of pa|rents!</P>
<P>I embraced her&mdash;<HI>Mi&s;taken parents,</HI> I have called them, madam&mdash;I have pitied them; but mo&s;t I have pitied you&mdash;Honour me with your &s;i&s;terly love. This be&s;t of men had before given me two Si&s;ters. Let us be four.</P>
<P>Be it &s;o, my dear Lady L. &s;aid Sir Charles, bring|ing her to us: And, cla&s;ping his arms about the three; You an&s;wer for the ab&s;ent Charlotte and your&s;elf; a fourfold cord that never &s;hall be broken.</P>
<P>Sir Charles led us to one &s;ettee, again putting a hand of each together, and &s;itting down over-again&s;t us; Lady L. on the other hand of him. We were both &s;ilent for a few moments, each &s;truggling with her tears.</P>
<P>My Harriet, madam, &s;aid Sir Charles, as I have told you, knows your whole &s;tory. You two are of long acquaintance. Your minds are kindred minds. Your griefs are hers: Your plea&s;ures &s;he will rejoice in as her own.&mdash;My Harriet, you now <HI>&s;ee,</HI> you now <HI>know</HI> by per&s;on, the admirable Clementina, who&s;e magnanimity you &s;o much admired, who&s;e character, you have &s;o often &s;aid, is the fir&s;t among women.</P>
<P>We both wept: But her tears &s;eemed tears of kind|ne&s;s and e&s;teem. I put the hand which was not in hers, on her arm. I wanted courage; my reverence for her would not allow me to be &s;o free, or it had again embraced the too con&s;cious Lady. Believe me, madam (excu&s;e my broken Italian) I have ever re|vered
<PB N="141" REF="142">
you. I have &s;aid often, very often, that your happine&s;s, happy as I am, is nece&s;&s;ary to complete mine, as well as Sir Charles Grandi&s;on's.</P>
<P>This goodne&s;s to me, a fugitive, an alien to your country; not a lover of your religion! O Lady Gran|di&s;on, you mu&s;t be as much all I have heard of you in your mind, as I &s;ee you are in your per&s;on. Re|ceive my thank for making happy the man I wi&s;hed to be the happie&s;t of men; for well does he de&s;erve to be made &s;o. We were Brother and Si&s;ter, madam, before he knew you. Let me be <HI>his</HI> Si&s;ter &s;till, and let me be <HI>yours.</HI></P>
<P>Kindred minds, Sir Charles Grandi&s;on calls ours, madam. He does me honour. May I, on further knowledge, appear to as much advantage in your eye, as you, from what I know of you, do in mine; and I &s;hall be a very happy creature!</P>
<P>Then you <HI>will</HI> be happy. I was <HI>prepared</HI> to love you. I love you already, methinks, with a pa&s;&s;ion that wants not further knowlege of your goodne&s;s to augment it. But can you, madam, look upon me with a <HI>true</HI> &s;i&s;terly eye? Can you pity me for the &s;tep I have taken, &s;o &s;eemingly deregatory to my glory? Can you believe me unhappy, but not wicked, for taking it? O madam! my rea&s;on has been di&s;turbed&mdash;Do you know that?&mdash;You mu&s;t attribute to that, &s;ome of my perver&s;ene&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Heaven, deare&s;t Lady Clementina, only knows how many tears your calamity has co&s;t me! In the mo&s;t arduous ca&s;es, I have preferred your happine&s;s to my own. You &s;hall know all of me, and of my heart. Not a &s;ecret of it, tho' yet uncommunicated to this deare&s;t of men&punc; will I conceal from you. I hope we &s;hall be true Si&s;ters, and true Friends, to the end of our lives.</P>
<P>My noble Harriet! &s;aid the generous man&mdash;Frank|ne&s;s of heart, my dear Clementina, is <HI>her</HI> characteri|&s;tic. She means all &s;he &s;ays; and will perform more
<PB N="142" REF="143">
than &s;he promi&s;es. I need not tell <HI>you,</HI> my Love, what our Clementina is: You know her to be the noble&s;t of women: Give her the promi&s;ed proofs of your confidence in her; and, whatever they be, they mu&s;t draw clo&s;e the knot which never will be untied.</P>
<P>Already, thus encouraged, &s;aid the noble Lady, let me apply to you, madam, to &s;trengthen for me the intere&s;t I pre&s;ume to have in the friend&s;hip of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on. Let me not, Sir, let me not, I intreat you all three, be compelled to give my vows to any man in marriage. All of you promi&s;e me; and I &s;hall with more delight look before me, than for a long, long time pa&s;t, I thought would fall to my Lot.</P>
<P>You, madam, mu&s;t concede a little, perhaps: Your parents mu&s;t a little relax. Their rea&s;on, if you will not be too unconceding, &s;hall not, if I am referred to, be mine, unle&s;s it is rea&s;on in every other impartial judgment. Would to Heaven they were at hand to be con&s;ulted!</P>
<P>What a wi&s;h! Then you would give me up! You are a good man: Will a good man re&s;i&s;t the autho|rity of parents, in favour of a run-away child? Dear, dear madam, cla&s;ping her arms about me, prevail up|on your Chevalier Grandi&s;on to protect me, to plead for me: He can deny <HI>you</HI> nothing: He will then pro|tect me, tho' my father, my mother, my brothers, &s;hould all join to demand me of him.</P>
<P>My dear Lady Clementina, &s;aid I, you may de|pend on <HI>your own</HI> intere&s;t with Sir Charles Grandi&s;on. He has your happine&s;s at heart, and will have, as much as I wi&s;h him to have mine.</P>
<P>Generous, noble, good Lady Grandi&s;on! how I admire you! May the Almighty &s;hower upon you his choice&s;t ble&s;&s;ings! If <HI>you</HI> allow me an intere&s;t in his &s;ervices, I <HI>demand</HI> it of you, Chevalier.</P>
<P><HI>Demand</HI> it, <HI>expect</HI> it, be <HI>a&s;&s;ured</HI> of it, my dear Lady Clementina. I want to talk with you upon your ex|pectations,
<PB N="143" REF="144">
your wi&s;hes. As much as is practicable, whatever they are, they &s;hall be mine.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, when then &s;hall we talk?&mdash;To-morrow will be too &s;oon for my &s;pirits.</P>
<P>Do my Harriet then the honour of pa&s;&s;ing the day on Monday with her. The dear friends we have for our gue&s;ts will choo&s;e to pa&s;s it with Lord and Lady G.&mdash;Your&s;elf, Lady L. my Harriet, and I, will be all the company: You &s;hall declare your plea&s;ure, and that &s;hall be a Law to me At pre&s;ent, this af|fecting interview has di&s;compo&s;ed us all; and we will retire.</P>
<P>Kindly con&s;idered! &s;aid &s;he: You are in England what you were in Italy&mdash;I <HI>am</HI> di&s;compo&s;ed. I have di&s;compo&s;ed <HI>you,</HI> madam! to me. I was born to give trouble to my friends. Forgive me! I once was happy&mdash;I may hope, madam, to Lady L. your &s;up|porting pre&s;ence at your brother's on Monday?</P>
<P>Lady L. bowed her a&s;&s;ent. She under&s;tands Italian; but &s;peaks it not.</P>
<P>The Lady &s;tood up, yet trembling. I will with|draw, Ladies, Sir, if you plea&s;e. My head &s;eems as if bound round by a tight cord (putting her hand to her forehead). Then cla&s;ping her arms round me, thus in a high &s;train &s;poke &s;he&mdash;Angel of a woman, gracious as the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin Mother, benign&punc; all that is good and great, I attend you on Monday. Adieu!&mdash;She ki&s;&s;ed my cheek, I cla&s;ped my arms about her. Revered Lady Clementina!&mdash;I could &s;ay no more. Tears, and tenderne&s;s of accent, interrupted my &s;peech. Lady L. conducted her to her own apartment, and left her to her Laura.</P>
<P>We &s;at down, admiring, prai&s;ing, praying for her. Dear, dear Sir. &s;aid I, taking Sir Charles's hand, Lady Clementina mu&s;t not be per&s;uaded. Perfua&s;ion is Compul&s;ion. Why comes over the Count of Bel|vedere? If &s;he knows it, I will not an&s;wer for her right mind.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="145">
My Uncle and Aunt, Lucy, Emily, were very cu|rious after particulars, when we came home, as we did to &s;upper.</P>
<P>Sir Charles left it to Lady L. to manage with Lady G. who he knew expected a day of our beloved gue&s;ts; and he him&s;elf apologized to them for the freedom he had taken of &s;o di&s;po&s;ing of them. They had the goodne&s;s to thank him for his freedom with them.

<P>LADY L. and Lady Clementina came, ju&s;t as we were preparing for breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>Lady L. had given her &s;uch an account of my friends, that &s;he was de&s;irous to &s;ee them, and, as &s;he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, to be&s;peak their favour to the poor fugitive. After the fir&s;t &s;alutations, &s;he ad|dre&s;&s;ed my aunt Selby in French, being told that &s;he &s;poke not Italian: You are happy, madam, &s;aid &s;he, in a niece, who may challenge the world to &s;hew her equal; and &s;till more happy in her being ble&s;&s;ed with &s;uch a hu&s;band. Merit is not always &s;o well reward|ed.&mdash;My aunt was &s;truck with the manner as well as with the words.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="146">
She made a very pretty compliment to my uncle; who, having forgot his French, could only bow, and &s;eem plea&s;ed. When Lucy was pre&s;ented to her, as my uncle's niece, and my favourite corre&s;pondent, You mu&s;t not, mademoi&s;elle, &s;aid &s;he, be angry with me, if I envy you.</P>
<P>To Emily, Happy, happy, young Lady! &s;aid &s;he. I have heard of you in Italy. Mrs. Beaumont &s;poke honourably of you to me, more than once. We both called you happy in &s;uch a guardian.</P>
<P>She made polite compliments to Mr. Deane; and be&s;poke all their favour to her. How does every|body admire her!</P>
<P>I hope, my dear grandmamma, you don't think I forget my cou&s;in Reeves's, tho' I mentioned them not before. I have already called in upon them twice: And they have, with the kind freedom of relations, dropt in upon us &s;everal times. They are invited gue&s;ts at <HI>Lord</HI> G's: I won't &s;ay <HI>Lady</HI> G's, tho' every|body el&s;e does.</P>
<P>This is what I &s;tole time to write, while Sir Charles is engaged in di&s;cour&s;e with the Lady, and our gue&s;ts are preparing to be gone to Lord G's, Lady G. re|que&s;ting my aunt's company early. She is the verie&s;t coward! The&s;e brave &s;pirits, &s;he has &s;aid, are but fla&s;h. Indeed the very delicate, as well as very &s;eri|ous, and even &s;olemn, circum&s;tances, which attend her ca&s;e, mu&s;t make the livelie&s;t woman, when the time approaches, <HI>think!</HI>&mdash;The inclo&s;ed note of hers to my aunt, brought late la&s;t night, is, however, in her u&s;ual &s;tile:</P>
<P>YOU and Lucy mu&s;t be here early To-morrow morning.</P>
<P>What wretched &s;impletons are we women! Daugh|ters of gewgaw, &s;olly, o&s;tentation, trifle!&mdash;Fir&s;t, we &s;hew our &s;orry fellow, when not di&s;approved, to our friends and relations; and take all their judgments

upon him. If he has their opinion in his favour, every-body, be he what he will, will prai&s;e him; and give him riches, &s;en&s;e, ance&s;try, and I cannot tell what of qualities that perhaps we &s;hall never find out. Then we &s;hew our pre&s;ents, our jewels, our laces; and a &s;mile &s;preads the mouth, and a &s;parkle gladdens the eye, of every maiden that hangs admiring over them. Ah, filly maidens! if you could look three yards from your no&s;es, you would pity, in&s;tead of envying, the milk-white heifer dre&s;&s;ed in ribbands, and ju&s;t ready to be led to &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>Well, then, what comes next? Why, the poor &s;oul, in a few months, by the time perhaps her gra|tulatory vi&s;its are half paid her, begins to find appre|hen&s;ion take place of &s;ecurity. Then are &s;he and all her virgins employed in the <HI>wretchede&s;t</HI> trifles&mdash;If I thought you had forgot them, I would give you a li&s;t of them&mdash;And the poor fools, wrapping up their jewels in cotton, with &s;ighs that perhaps they have worn them for the la&s;t time, and doubtful whom they may next adorn, cover the decked-out milk-white bed with their baby-things. See here! and, See here! and, What is the u&s;e of this, and of that? a&s;ks the curious, and perhaps too fearle&s;s maiden. "Why, this is for&mdash;" and "That is for&mdash;" an&s;wer the matrons who have pa&s;&s;ed the Rubicon.</P>
<P>And to this is your Charlotte reduced!&mdash;Aunt Selby, Lucy, come early, that I may &s;how you my <HI>baby</HI>-things!&mdash;O dear! O dear! O dear!&mdash;and that you may be able to te&s;tify, that I had no de&s;ign to overlay the little Marmou&s;et. Adieu till ten to|morrow morning.</P>

<P>The moment our gue&s;ts were gone, Sir Charles came to me; and, leading me into my drawing-room, where the Lady was, Comfort, my Love, &s;aid he, your Si&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="148">
I ha&s;tened to her (poor Lady! &s;he was in tears, and even &s;obbing); and cla&s;ping my arms about her, Be comforted, be con&s;oled, my deare&s;t Lady Cle|mentina.</P>
<P>O madam! my Father, my Mother, my Jerony|mo, are every day expected; who be&s;ide, I know not: How &s;hall I look my Father, my Mother, in the face!</P>
<P>Sir Charles withdrew. He was troubled for her. He &s;ent in Lady L.</P>
<P><HI>Your</HI> dear friend, madam, &s;aid I, and <HI>my</HI> dear friend, will protect you. Your father and mother would not have had the thoughts of taking &s;o long and trouble&s;ome a voyage, had they not re&s;olved to do every thing in their power to re&s;tore you to peace, and to them.</P>
<P>So the Chevalier tells me.</P>
<P>At this time of the year, madam, &s;uch a voyage! your mamma &s;o tender in her health! Such a di&s;like to the &s;ea! Her whole motive is tenderne&s;s and love. She prefers your health, your tranquillity, to her own.</P>
<P>And is not this con&s;ideration enough to di&s;tre&s;s a grateful &s;pirit?&mdash;Unworthy Clementina! To every relation, in every action, of late unworthy! What trouble ha&s;t thou given thy parents! I cannot, can|not bear to &s;ee them!&mdash;O my Lady Grandi&s;on, I was ever a perver&s;e creature! Whatever I &s;et my heart upon, I was unea&s;y, till I had compa&s;&s;ed it. My pride, and my perver&s;ene&s;s, have co&s;t me dear. But of late I have been more perver&s;e than ever. My heart ran upon coming to England. I could think of nothing till I came. I have tried that experiment. I am &s;ick of it. I do not like England, now I &s;ee I cannot be unmole&s;ted here. But my favourite for years, was another project. That filled my mind, and helped me to make the &s;acrifice I did.&mdash;and here I am come to almo&s;t the only country in Europe, which could render my darling wi&s;h impracticable.
<PB N="148" REF="149">
Why went I not to France? I had with me &s;ufficient to have obtained my admi&s;&s;ion into any order of nuns: And had I been once profe&s;&s;ed!&mdash;I will get away &s;till, I think. Befriend me, my &s;i&s;ter! I cannot, cannot, &s;ee my mother!</P>
<P>Sir Charles came in ju&s;t then. I heard what you la&s;t &s;aid, madam, &s;aid he: Compo&s;e your&s;elf, I be|&s;eech you. I dreaded to acquaint you with the ex|pected arrival of your parents. But are they not the mo&s;t indulgent of parents? You <HI>have</HI> nothing, you <HI>&s;hall</HI> have nothing to fear, and you will have every|thing to hope, from their pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Will you engage for their allowing of a divine de|dication, Sir? Will you plead that cau&s;e for me?</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ay what will, what can, be done, till I &s;ee them. But confide in my zeal to &s;erve you, madam. Lord L's hou&s;e, I repeat, &s;hall be your a&s;ylum, till you &s;hall con&s;ent to &s;ee them. I cannot be guilty of a prevarication: I will own to them, that I know where you are; but, till you give leave, you &s;hall be as much concealed from their knowledge, as if you were &s;till at your fir&s;t lodgings, and I my&s;elf ignorant of your abode.</P>
<P>A man of honour, &s;aid &s;he, her hands lifted up, is more valuable to a woman in trouble, than all the riches of the Ea&s;t! But tell me now, tell me upon your never-forfeited honour, whom, be&s;ides my <HI>Fa|ther, Mother,</HI> and your <HI>Jeronymo,</HI> do you expect?</P>
<P>My Lord the <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> madam&mdash;</P>
<P>Oh! Oh! &s;aid &s;he, clapping her hands together, with an inimitable grace and eagerne&s;s&mdash;I am afraid&mdash;But whom el&s;e?</P>
<P>Father <HI>Mare&s;cotti</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>The good man! will <HI>he</HI> think it worth his while&mdash;But for my father and mother's &s;ake he will&mdash;Whom el&s;e?</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Beaumont,</HI> madam, never intended to &s;et her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">oot on Engli&s;h ground again: But &s;he has broken thro' her re&s;olution, to oblige your mother.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="150">
Good Mrs. Beaumont!&mdash;But I am half afraid of her. Well, Sir?</P>
<P><HI>Camilla,</HI> your poor Camilla, madam.</P>
<P>Poor Camilla! I u&s;ed her hardly: But teazing ne|ver yet did good with me. Remember, Sir, they are not to know were I am. Your hou&s;e, madam, to Lady L. is to be my a&s;ylum.&mdash;Then &s;eeing me af|fected, Gentle&s;t of human hearts, &s;aid &s;he, what right have I thus to pain you! Well, Sir, drying her eyes, with looks too earne&s;t for her health of mind; tell me, is any-body el&s;e expected?</P>
<P>Your cou&s;ins Seba&s;tiano and Juliano, madam; but not the General.</P>
<P>Thank Heaven for that!&mdash;I love my brother Gia|como: But he is &s;o determined a man!&mdash;His own Lady only can &s;often his heart.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, by his admirable addre&s;s, made her tolerably ea&s;y by dinner-time, on the &s;ubject of her friends expected arrival: And &s;he once owned, that &s;he &s;hould be tran&s;ported with joy to &s;ee her Father, Mother, and Jeronymo, could &s;he a&s;&s;ure her&s;elf, that &s;he could &s;ee them with forgivene&s;s in their counte|nances.</P>
<P>Sir Charles would only be attended at table by Saunders, whom &s;he had &s;een in Italy. She was much plea&s;ed to have it &s;o; but de&s;ired Laura might be permitted to attend at the back of her own chair.</P>
<P>I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to Laura three of four times, as &s;he &s;tood. The Lady was plea&s;ed: And Laura &s;eemed proud of my notice.</P>
<P>Now-and-then an involuntary tear filled the La|dy's eye, as &s;he fat. It was ea&s;y to enter into her thoughts, p oor Lady! on her &s;ituation. She was griev|ed, &s;he &s;aid, at the trouble &s;he gave me; and frequent|ly &s;ought to &s;uppre&s;s a &s;igh. Once, after a re&s;verie of? few minutes; And am I here? &s;aid &s;he; In England? At the hou&s;e of the Chevalier Grandi&s;on? Can it be a</P>
<P>After dinner, Lady L. and &s;he and I, retiring to
<PB N="150" REF="151">
my drawing-room; What a generous Lady, &s;aid &s;he, are you! I was afraid to &s;ee you, <HI>before</HI> I &s;aw you: But the moment I beheld you, I embraced a Si&s;ter. You will allow of my e&s;teem of your Grandi&s;on?</P>
<P>Of your <HI>Love,</HI> dear Lady Clementina, and thank you for it. A good man has an Intere&s;t in every good per&s;on's affections.</P>
<P>Such genero&s;ity, &s;natching my hand with both hers, would confirm a doubtful goodne&s;s. But indeed my e&s;teem for him always &s;oared above per&s;on. You know I am a zealous Catholic. You know our doctrine of merits. I would have laid down my life to &s;ave his &s;oul. But &s;urely God will be merciful to &s;uch a man, and no le&s;s &s;o to &s;uch a woman, as (putting her Arms about me) I have now the honour to embrace.</P>
<P>Mercy, madam, &s;aid I, is the darling attribute of the Almighty. He is the God of <HI>all</HI> men.</P>
<P>True&mdash;But&mdash;And was going to &s;ay &s;omething &s;ur|ther; but &s;topt on Sir Charles's entrance.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, after &s;itting with us a little while, a&s;k|ed leave of ab&s;ence for an hour, to look on his friends at Lord G's. We had a charming conver&s;ation in the mean time. Our &s;ubjects were various. The cu&s;toms of Italian Ladies, and their &s;urpri&s;ing illite|ratene&s;s in general, were parts of it. A woman there, it &s;eems, who knew more than her own tongue, was a miracle till within the&s;e few years, that the French cu&s;toms &s;eem prevailing there. Why, madam, the Ladies of Italy, with genius's as fine as that cla&s;|&s;ic climate ever produced, are immer&s;ed in the plea|&s;ures of &s;en&s;e: Singing, dancing, and conver&s;ation-gallantry, take up their whole time. One would ima|gine, that their hu&s;bands and fathers thought them only children of this world, and not heirs of a better hope, by the little care taken in improving their un|der&s;tanding: And were it not for the religion of the country, which we call &s;uper&s;tition, half the Italian
<PB N="151" REF="152">
world of women would be looked upon merely as temporary idols for men to wor&s;hip for temporary gratifications only. Yet in their conver&s;ation-a&s;&s;em|blies, men &s;ee what they are capable of. But their country, it &s;eems, is in the &s;ame uncultivated &s;tate, as the minds of their women. The garden of the world, as Italy is called, is over-run with weeds: And, for want of cultivation, the very richne&s;s of its &s;oil becomes its di&s;ea&s;e. But the&s;e reflexions I draw rather by deduction from what Lady Clemen|tia &s;aid, than from any direct confe&s;&s;ion of hers. She is fond of her country in its pre&s;ent &s;tate: But &s;en&s;i|ble Engli&s;h travellers &s;peak of it as I have written.</P>
<P>Sir Charles returned within his time. He is kind to be every-where; for he is the life of every com|pany, and of every individual.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed a &s;weet evening together, and till near eleven o'clock. Were Lady Clementina happy, how happy &s;hould we all be!</P>
<P>Sir Charles waited on the Ladies home. Lord L. was by that time returned from Lord G's; but was the fir&s;t of the friendly company that withdrew. La|dy G. it &s;eems, was all alive in every part of the on|tertainment. My uncle Selby and &s;he &s;pared not each other. Her Lord, I &s;an&s;y, fared the better or the pre&s;ence of the Earl and Lady Gertrude, and for her having my Uncle to &s;hoot at.</P>

<P>OUR grief will be your joy, my deare&s;t grand|mamma! My Uncle, my Aunt Lucy, Emily, Mr. Deane!&mdash;They are ju&s;t gone: Ju&s;t left me.</P>
<P>What a parting!&mdash;But Emily! Dear creature! what was her grief, her noble &s;truggle with her&s;elf, to conceal her angui&s;h from her guardian!</P>
<P>She will now be yours, and my aunt Selby's; and, when once &s;ettled, will, mu&s;t, be happy; for &s;he is good, and you all love her, and will love her the more for this great in&s;tance of her noblene&s;s of mind.</P>
<P>About half an hour before we parted, &s;he begged to &s;peak a few words to me in my clo&s;et. I led her thither. When we entered it, &s;he &s;hut the door, and dropt down on her knees. I would have rai&s;ed her; but &s;he would not be rai&s;ed. I cla&s;ped my arms about her neck. I have revealed all my folly to you, &s;aid &s;he. Forgive the weakne&s;s of a poor girl. A thou&s;and, thou&s;and thanks to you, madam, for your indulgent goodne&s;s to me. I longed to live with you and my guardian. I placed my whole happine&s;s in the grant. You gave me an opportunity to try the experiment. What I little expected happened: I was more unhappy than before. I revere your grand|mamma: She is a ble&s;&s;ed Lady! How good was &s;he on your wedding-day, to wi&s;h me, poor <HI>me!</HI> to &s;up|ply to her the lo&s;s of her Harriet! Her goodne&s;s, her conde&s;cen&s;ion, that of all your family, overcame me: It would <HI>not,</HI> perhaps, had I not tried the other ex|periment. All that I have now to beg of you, is, to pardon me for the trouble I mu&s;t have given to your noble heart: It <HI>is</HI> a noble heart, or it could not have borne with me as it has done. But promi&s;e to write a

<P>I <HI>do</HI> promi&s;e, my Love, my Emily. The corre|&s;pondence between us will delight me. Nobody &s;hall &s;ee any of our Letters, but at your choice.</P>
<P>Lady L. Lady G. may, madam: They love the poor Emily. Nobody el&s;e may, I believe; I &s;hall write &s;o poorly!&mdash;But I &s;hall improve as I have more years, and more &s;en&s;e. But my pre&s;ent concern is more for Lady Clementina than for my&s;elf. Poor Lady! Pray write &s;omething of her friends behaviour to her, and hers to them, to <HI>me</HI> particularly, be&s;ides what you write to your grandmamma: I &s;hall take it for <HI>&s;uch</HI> a favour!

<P>All that &s;he wi&s;hed me to do, and &s;till more, as occa&s;ions offered, I promi&s;ed.</P>
<P>She aro&s;e from her knees, called me by many tender names; ki&s;&s;ed one cheek, then the other; then one hand, then the other. I folded her to my fond heart: My Si&s;ter, my Friend, my Emily, I called her. We wetted each other's Bo&s;om with our tears; and both went down with red eyes.</P>
<P>Extremely tender, but delicate, was the leave &s;he took of her guardian. The Brother, the affectionate Friend, and Father, I may &s;ay, appeared in his un|re&s;erved tenderne&s;s to her. She hurried into my uncle's coach, which &s;tood ready, when &s;he parted with him, that her emotion might not be too vi&s;ible. I ha&s;tening in after her, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be too much
<PB N="154" REF="155">
affected; while my Aunt, Lucy, and my Uncle, were taking their leaves in the hall.</P>
<P>My deare&s;t Emily, I admire you! &s;aid I. Do you, do you!&mdash;Be&s;t of wives, of women, of friends, of &s;i&s;ters, do you &s;ay &s;o?&mdash;I behaved not ami&s;s, then?</P>
<P>Ami&s;s! No, my dear: Charmingly, my Love! You are great as ever woman was.</P>
<P>How you comfort me!</P>
<P>Adieu, adieu! my be&s;t Love! &s;aid I.&mdash;My be&s;t Lady Grandi&s;on! &s;aid &s;he: Both in a breath, as from one heart, embracing; and quitting each other with regret; her arms folded about her&s;elf, when I left her; as if I were &s;till within them.</P>
<P>I gave my hand to Sir Edward Beauchamp, on &s;tepping out of the coach; for he was ready to attend them; and hurrying into the hall, threw my&s;elf into the arms of my aunt. My Love, &s;aid &s;he, take care of your&s;elf: Emily &s;hall not need to be <HI>your</HI> concern: She will be our Harriet.</P>
<P>Indeed &s;he &s;hall, &s;aid Lucy. Dear girl, &s;he &s;hall be mine: And, thank God, I now have two Harriets in&s;tead of one.</P>
<P>My uncle wept like a child at parting with me. He would have carried it off, &s;miling in his tears. What, what, &s;obbed he, &s;hall I do for my girl! I &s;hall mi&s;s, I &s;hall mi&s;s, your &s;au-&s;au-&s;aucine&s;s &s;ometimes&mdash;Was I ever angry with you in my Life?</P>
<P>Mr. Deane comforted him&s;elf, that he &s;hould but &s;ettle his affairs at Peterborough, and then would make our re&s;idence his, where-ever we &s;hould be.</P>
<P>All of them departed ble&s;&s;ing us, and we them; hoping for a &s;peedy meeting in Northampton&s;hire. Every one expre&s;s'd their &s;olicitude for the happine&s;s of Lady Clementina, as well for her own &s;ake, as for Sir Charles's and mine.</P>

<P>HERE we are, my Grandi&s;on; my father and mother &s;o indifferent in their healths, that we &s;hall have time to wait for your direction. My mo|ther was &s;o incommoded, that we put in at Antibes; and by &s;low journeys, &s;topping a few days at Paris, proceeded to Calais, where we hired a ve&s;&s;el to bring us hither. My Brother, and Father Mare&s;cotti, are indi&s;po&s;ed. Camilla is not well. Mrs. Beaumont, to whom we owe infinite obligations, is the life of us all.</P>
<P>Have you heard of the dear fugitive, who has given us all &s;o much di&s;turbance, and, at this &s;ea&s;on of the year, &s;o much fatigue? God grant that &s;he may be &s;afe in your protection, and in her right mind! Had &s;he been &s;o at the time&punc; &s;he had never meditated &s;uch a wild, &s;uch a di&s;graceful flight. The heart of the Count of Belvedere is torn in pieces by his impatience. He will &s;oon follow the man and hor&s;e whom we di|&s;patch with this. Signor Seba&s;tiano will accompany him. Juliano will &s;tay with us. The fatigue has been rather too much for your Jeronymo: But he rejoices, that he has his foot on Engli&s;h ground; the country that gave birth to his Grandi&s;on; and in his hopes of &s;eeing his kind and &s;kilful Lowther. God grant us a happy meeting; and that no interruption may have been given to your nuptial happine&s;s, by the extravagance of a young creature, which can

<P>ABOUT two hours ago, Sir Charles received a Letter from Signor Jeronymo. The man had rode all night. They are all at Dover.</P>
<P>Sir Charles is already &s;et out; gone, with four coaches and &s;ix, of our own and friends, for them, and their attendants; Mr. Lowther with him. Richard Saunders is left to attend the Count of Belvedere to the lodgings taken for him.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e in Gro&s;venor-&s;quare is ready for the re|ception of the illu&s;trious gue&s;ts.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I can get quieter &s;pirits, I will attend Lady Clementina, in order to re-a&s;&s;ure her, if I find &s;ue has pre&s;ence of mind enough to hear the news. Sir Charles has already induced her to wi&s;h the cri&s;is over. It <HI>is</HI> a cri&s;is. I am almo&s;t as much affected for her, as &s;he can be for her&s;elf.

<P><HI>In Lady L's clo&s;et.</HI>] I have, as gently as I could, broken the news of their &s;afe arrival at Dover, to Lady Clementina. She began the &s;ubject; and &s;aid, She had been praying for the &s;afety of her friends. What will become of me, &s;aid &s;he, &s;hould mi&s;hap befal any one of them? Should the fatigue be too
<PB N="157" REF="158">
much for either my father or mother, their healths &s;o precarious; or for my Jeronymo, &s;o lately ill?</P>
<P>After proper prefacings, I hoped, I &s;aid, her cares on that &s;ubject would &s;oon be over. Sir Charles had &s;ome intimation of the likelihood of their arrival at a particular port; and was actually &s;et out with coaches, in hopes of accommodating them, when they <HI>did</HI> ar|rive, and to bring them to the hou&s;e which had been (as &s;he knew before) got ready for their reception.</P>
<P>She looked by turns on me, and on Lady L. in &s;peechle&s;s terror: At la&s;t, Then I am &s;ure, &s;aid &s;he, you know they are come. Tell me, tell me, are they indeed arrived? And are they all well?</P>
<P>I owned they were, and at Dover; and waited there to refre&s;h them&s;elves, and to be informed of her health and &s;afety before they would proceed further.</P>
<P>She wept, even to &s;obbing; inveighed again&s;t her|&s;elf: Her tears were tears of duty and tenderne&s;s. She comforted her&s;elf, that Sir Charles would be able to &s;often their re&s;entments again&s;t her; and &s;he was &s;ure he would make the be&s;t conditions for her, that could be obtained.</P>
<P>Lord L. is all goodne&s;s, all compa&s;&s;ion, to her. He greatly admires her. But we ob&s;erve, that there are &s;ome little traces of wildne&s;s now-and-then in her talk, which carries her into high language and excla|mation. May her mind be quieted! May her intel|lects be pre&s;erved entire, in the affecting &s;cenes before her!&mdash;I am &s;ent for home in ha&s;te.</P>

<P>METHINKS I am half afraid of telling even you, my grandmamma, at this di&s;tance, to whom I was &s;ent for. It was to the Count of Belvedere. Signor Seba&s;tiano was with him. Lord G. happened to call in at St. James's Square, when they arrived; and &s;ending for me, entertained them till I came.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked Lord G. half out of breath with fear, at
<PB N="158" REF="159">
my <HI>fir&s;t alighting,</HI> If he had &s;aid any-thing of the Lady? Not a &s;yllable, &s;aid he: I avoided an&s;wering que&s;tions. The gentlemen were full of impatience to know &s;omething about her: And this made me &s;end for you: For, tho' cautioned, I was afraid of blundering.&mdash;Hone&s;t, mode&s;t, worthy Lord G!&mdash;I prevailed on them to &s;tay &s;upper with me. Lord G. was &s;o obliging, as to &s;end home to excu&s;e him&s;elf to his Lady, at my reque&s;t.</P>
<P>They are both fine young gentlemen; extremely polite. We have been told, that the Count is a hand&s;ome man. Indeed he is. Any Lady, with &s;uch a character as he has, if &s;he were not prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed, might like him. He is certainly a gentle-di&s;po|&s;itioned and good-natured man. He looks the man of quality. He &s;eems not to be above five or &s;ix-and-twenty: Has a foreign a&s;pect, and a complexion a &s;allowi&s;h brown; yet has a healthy look. His eyes, however, as I knew his ca&s;e, appeared to me to have a ca&s;t like tho&s;e of a man who&s;e mind is di&s;turbed.</P>
<P>I behaved to them with the greate&s;t frankne&s;s I could &s;hew. I told them, that Sir Charles &s;et out in the morning, on the receipt of a letter from Dover, for that port, and with what equipages. They gave but a poor account of the health of the Marchione&s;s: But if &s;he could but hear good tidings, he &s;aid, and &s;topt&mdash;</P>
<P>Sir Charles, I an&s;wered, would do his utmo&s;t to &s;et their hearts at ea&s;e.</P>
<P>May I not a&s;k a que&s;tion, madam? &s;aid the Count. I find your Lady&s;hip knows every-thing of us, and our affairs. We heard in Italy, that you were all goodne&s;s; and find you to be an angel. I make no compliment, &s;aid he, laying his &s;pread hand on his heart.</P>
<P>Lord G. with kind officiou&s;ne&s;s, &s;aid, that was the univer&s;al voice.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="160">
I an&s;wered in French, the language in which he &s;poke to me&mdash;That I had the plea&s;ure of informing him, that Letters had pa&s;&s;ed between Lady Clemen|tina and Sir Charles. The account &s;he gives of her|&s;elf, &s;aid I, makes us not quite unhappy.</P>
<P><HI>Makes</HI> Us! &s;aid the Count to Signor Seba&s;tiano, in Italian, his hands lifted up: Heavenly goodne&s;s!</P>
<P>I imagined that he thought I under&s;tood not that tongue; and that I might not mi&s;lead them into un|due compliments: I &s;aid, in my broken-accented Italian, We all here, Signors, are as much intere&s;ted in the health and happine&s;s of Lady Clementina, as any of her friends in Italy can be.</P>
<P>They applauded all of us, who were, as they &s;aid, &s;o generou&s;ly intere&s;ted in the happine&s;s of one of the mo&s;t excellent of women.</P>
<P>I told the Count, that Sir Charles had, as de&s;ired, provided lodgings for him. I hoped he would find them convenient, tho' Sir Charles thought them not befitting his quality. He &s;aid, before he &s;et out this morning (hearing that their Lord&s;hips were then pro|bably on their journey from Dover to London) order|ed his gentleman to attend him to them: You, Sig|nor, &s;aid I, are, if you plea&s;e, with Signor Juliano, to be Sir Charles's own gue&s;ts. We have another hou&s;e which will be honoured with the re&s;idence of the Marquis and Marchione&s;s, their Sons, the good Father Mare&s;cotti, and their other friends.</P>
<P><HI>Good</HI> Father Mare&s;cotti! repeated the Count&mdash;Ex|cellent Lady Grandi&s;on!&mdash;But you &s;ay well: Father Mare&s;cotti is indeed a good man.</P>
<P>I have by heart, my Lord, &s;aid I, the characters of all my dear Sir Charles's good friends.</P>
<P>Again the two Lords looked upon each other, as admiring me.</P>
<P>Pity, my dear grandmamma, that different na|tions of the world, tho' of different per&s;ua&s;ions, did not, more than they do, con&s;ider them&s;elves as the
<PB N="160" REF="161">
creatures of one God, the Sovereign of a thou&s;and worlds!</P>
<P>The Count expre&s;&s;ed great impatience to know &s;ome particulars of Lady Clementina. I took this opportunity to &s;ay, that as I had been informed of the tran&s;cendent piety of the Lady, and of her great earne&s;tne&s;s, from her earlie&s;t youth, to take the veil, I pre&s;umed it would forward the good under&s;tanding hoped for, if it were not at pre&s;ent known, that his Lord&s;hip was arrived; and the rather, as &s;everal ten|der &s;cenes might be expected to pa&s;s between her and her other friends, which perhaps her pre&s;ent (ea&s;ily to be &s;uppo&s;ed) weak &s;pirits, and turn of mind, might with difficulty enable her to &s;upport.</P>
<P>The Count &s;ighed: But, bowing, &s;aid, He came with a very &s;mall retinue, becau&s;e he would be as private as po&s;&s;ible. He had been for many months determined to vi&s;it England: The family della Por|retta, Signor Jeronymo, in particular, had promi&s;ed to vi&s;it Sir Charles in it likewi&s;e: They &s;hould indeed have cho&s;en a better &s;ea&s;on for it, had not their care and concern for one of the mo&s;t excellent of women induced them to anticipate their intentions. He was entirely of my opinion, he added, that his arrival in England &s;hould not at pre&s;ent be known by Lady Clementina.</P>
<P>He then, in a very gallant, but mode&s;t manner, owned to my Lord G. and me his pa&s;&s;ion for her; and &s;aid, that on the i&s;&s;ue of this adventure of the dear Lady hung his de&s;tiny.</P>
<P>I told him, I had been the more free in giving my humble advice, as to the keeping &s;ecret his Lord&s;hip's arrival, as, but for that rea&s;on, I could a&s;&s;ure him Sir Charles would not have permitted his Lord&s;hip, or any of his train, to go into his lodgings: And I mentioned the high regard which I knew Sir Charles had for the Count of Belvedere.</P>
<P>I ordered &s;upper to be got early, as I &s;uppo&s;ed the
<PB N="161" REF="162">
two Lords would be glad to retire &s;oon, after the fa|tigue of their journey; for they had &s;et out early in the morning. I &s;ent a note begging the favour of my cou&s;in Reeves's company to &s;upper; apologizing, by the occa&s;ion, for the &s;hort notice. They were &s;o kind as to come. They admire the two young noble|men: for Signo r Seba&s;tiano, as well as the Count, is a &s;en&s;ible mode&s;t young man. Mr. Reeves and they entered into free conver&s;ation in French, which we all under&s;tood, on their country, voyage, and jour|ney by land. Both gentlemen &s;poke of Sir Charles, and his behaviour in Italy, in raptures.</P>
<P>My cou&s;in Reeves, attended by Saunders, was &s;o good as to conduct the Count to his lodgings, in his coach; Sir Charles having all our equipages with him.</P>

He found the Marchione&s;s, Signor Jero|nymo, and the good Camilla, as he calls her, very much indi&s;po&s;ed from the fatigues they had under|gone both in mind and body.

<P>He gave me, la&s;t night and this morning, an ac|count of what pa&s;&s;ed between the family and him&s;elf, from his arrival at Dover, to their coming to town la&s;t night.</P>
<P>They confe&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t obligations to him for attending them in per&s;on; and for bringing Mr. Low|ther with him. But when, on their eager que&s;tions to him after their Clementina, he told them, that he had heard from her, and that &s;he had owned her&s;elf to be in honourable and tender hands, the Marquis lifted up his eyes in thankful rapture: The Marchio|ne&s;s, with cla&s;ped hands, &s;eemed to prai&s;e God; but her lips only moved: All the re&s;t expre&s;&s;ed their joy in words dictated by truly affectionate hearts.</P>
<P>Sir Charles found them all mo&s;t cordially di&s;po&s;ed to forgive the dear fugitive, as the Bi&s;hop called her: But, depend upon it, added the Prelate, nothing will &s;ecure her head, but our yielding to her in her long wi&s;hed-for hope of the convent, or on prevailing on her to marry: And if you, Grandi&s;on, join with us, I que&s;tion not, but the latter may be effected.</P>
<P>Sir Charles blamed them for having precipitated her as they had done.</P>
<P>That, &s;aid the Bi&s;hop, was partly the fault of our well meaning Giacomo; and partly her own; for more than once &s;he gave us hope that &s;he would com|ply with our wi&s;hes.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="167">
I be&s;ought Sir Charles, that he would not be pre|vailed upon to take part with them, if &s;he continued aver&s;e to a change of condition.</P>
<P>I waved the &s;ubject, my deare&s;t Life, replied he, at the time. I have continued to do &s;o ever &s;ince, I want only to &s;ee them &s;ettled, and Lady Clemen|tina compo&s;ed, and then I &s;hall know what can be done. Till then, arguments on either &s;ide, will rather &s;trengthen than remove difficulties.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop, with great concern, told Sir Charles, that when the fir&s;t news of Clementina's flight was brought to Bologna, her poor mother was for two days as unhappy in her mind, as ever her daughter had been; and when it was found likely that Clemen|tina was gone to England, &s;he in&s;i&s;ted &s;o vehemently on following her, that they had no other way to pa|cify her, but by promi&s;ing that they would out of hand, pay to Sir Charles the vi&s;it they intended, and &s;ome of them had engaged to make him. Nor would &s;he, when &s;he grew better on their promi&s;e, acquit them of it. This determined them to this winter excur&s;ion, &s;orely again&s;t the will of &s;ome of them: And it was in compa&s;&s;ion to this unhappy &s;tate of the poor mother's mind, that Mrs. Beaumont con&s;ented to accompany her.</P>
<P>Sir Charles is gone to attend Lady Clementina. He then propo&s;es to welcome the Count of Belvedere into England; and afterwards to wait on the noble family, and know when I &s;hall be permitted to pay my devoirs to them.</P>

<P>SIR Charles pre&s;ented me to this expecting family. I admire them all.</P>
<P>The Marquis and Marchione&s;s are a fine couple. There is dignity in their a&s;pects and behaviour. A fixed kind of melancholy &s;its upon the features of each. The Bi&s;hop has the man of quality in his ap|pearance; but he has &s;omething more &s;olemn in his countenance than even Father Mare&s;cotti; who, at a glance, is not unlike our Dr. Bartlett: The more like, as goodne&s;s and humility both &s;hine in his counte|nance.</P>
<P>But Signor Jeronymo is an amiable young man: I could, almo&s;t at fir&s;t &s;ight (and his winning grace confirmed me) have called him Brother. With &s;ignal kindne&s;s did my Sir Charles pre&s;ent me to this his dear friend: and with equal kindne&s;s did Signor Je|ronymo receive me, and congratulate Sir Charles: They all joined in the congratulation.</P>
<P>The amiable Mrs. Beaumont!&mdash;She embraced me! She felicitated me, with &s;uch a grace, as made her manner &s;urpa&s;s even her words.</P>
<P>The good Camilla was pre&s;ented to me. She has the look of a gentlewoman. How many &s;cenes did the &s;ight of this good woman revive in my memory! Some of them painful ones!</P>
<P><HI>Signior Mar&s;igli,</HI> as he is called, and the two young Lords, dined with them. This being a fir&s;t vi&s;it on my part, we made it a &s;hort one. We went from them to Lady G's, and drank tea with her and her Lord. Sir Charles could not bear, he &s;aid, to go im|mediately from the &s;ighing parents to the &s;orrowing daughter; they not knowing, nor being at pre&s;ent to know, &s;he was &s;o near them.</P>
<P>Lady G. was <HI>&s;o</HI> petulant, <HI>&s;o</HI> whim&s;ical, when her

<P>NOthing deci&s;ive yet, my dear grandmamma.</P>
<P>There have been &s;ome generous contentions between the family and Sir Charles. He has be&s;ought them to make their hearts ea&s;y, and he will comply with all their rea&s;onable de&s;ires.</P>
<P>They think not of dining with, or vi&s;iting us, till they can hear &s;ome tidings of their beloved daughter.</P>
<P>Lord G. Lord L. and Lady L. as al&s;o Mrs. Eleanor Grandi&s;on, have been pre&s;ented to them.</P>
<P>Sir Charles has begun to enter into a treaty, as I may call it, with the Lady on one part, her Family on the &s;econd, and the Count of Belvedere on the third. Lady Clementina, it &s;eems, in&s;i&s;ts upon being allow|ed to take the veil; and that in a manner that &s;ome|times carries wildne&s;s with it. The Bi&s;hop, Sir Charles thinks, &s;eems le&s;s fervent in his oppo&s;ition to it, than formerly. Father Mare&s;cotti, in his heart, he be|lieves, favours her wi&s;hes. But the Marquis and Marchione&s;s, and Signor Jeronymo, plead their own inclinations, their Son the General's unabated fervor,
<PB N="169" REF="170">
in behalf of the marriage, were it but to &s;ecure the performance of the grandfather's will, and to be an effectual di&s;appointment of the intere&s;ted hopes of Lady Sforza and her daughter Laurana. The Count of Belvedere's pa&s;&s;ion for the Lady (notwith&s;tanding her unhappy malady pa&s;t, and apprehended) makes a great merit for him with the family; and the two young Lords think &s;o highly of him for his per&s;eve|rance, that they are attached to his intere&s;t; and de|clare, that the Conte della Porretta their father is as &s;trongly on the &s;ame &s;ide as the General him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the fond mother is &s;o impatient to &s;ee her daughter, that they are afraid of the con|&s;equences, as to health both of mind and body, if a &s;peedy determination be not come to: On the other hand, the young Lady grieves to find her&s;elf, as &s;he &s;ays, in &s;uch a &s;ituation, as to be obliged to in&s;i&s;t on conditions with her parents, before &s;he can throw her|&s;elf at their feet; which &s;he longs to do, tho' &s;he dreads to &s;ee them. Sometimes (and they are when &s;he is calme&s;t) &s;he blames her&s;elf for the &s;tep &s;he has taken; at others, &s;he endeavours to find excu&s;es for it.</P>

<P>SIR Charles has drawn up a paper at the reque&s;t of all parties. He la&s;t night gave a copy of it to the Lady; another to the Count: a third to the Bi&s;hop; for them all to con&s;ider of the contents; and he will attend them to-morrow for their an&s;wer. He has been plea&s;ed to give me al&s;o a copy of it; which is as follows:</P>
<P N="1">I. That Lady Clementina, in obedience to the will of her two decea&s;ed grandfathers, in duty to her parents and uncle, and in compliance with the earne&s;t &s;upplications of the mo&s;t affectionate of brothers, &s;hall engage her honour to give up all thoughts of withdrawing from the world,
<PB N="170" REF="171">
not only for the pre&s;ent, but for all future time, &s;o long as &s;he &s;hall remain in her maiden &s;tate.</P>
<P N="2">II. She &s;hall be at liberty to choo&s;e her way of Life; and &s;hall be allowed, at her own plea|&s;ure, to vi&s;it her Brother and his Lady at Na|ples; her Uncle at Urbino; Mrs. Beaumont at Florence; and be put into the immediate per|ception of the profits of the e&s;tate bequeathed to her, if &s;he choo&s;es it; that &s;he may be enabled to do that exten&s;ive good with the produce, that &s;he could not do, were &s;he to renounce the world; in which ca&s;e, that e&s;tate would devolve to one, who, it is but too probable, would make a very different u&s;e of it.</P>
<P N="3">III. She &s;hall have the liberty of nominating her own attendants; and in ca&s;e of death, or removal by promotion, of Father Mare&s;cotti (who&s;e merits mu&s;t at la&s;t render him con&s;picuous) to choo&s;e her own confe&s;&s;or: But that her Father and Mother &s;hall have their negative pre&s;erved to them, in either ca&s;e, while &s;he continues in their palace: Nor will the dear Lady think this a hard&s;hip; for &s;he wi&s;hes not to be independent on parents, of who&s;e indulgent goodne&s;s to her &s;he is mo&s;t dutifully &s;en&s;ible; and it is rea&s;onable, that they &s;hould be judges of the conduct of eve|ry one who is to be a dome&s;tic in their family.</P>
<P N="4">IV. As Lady Clementina, from &s;ome late unhap|py circum&s;tances, thinks &s;he cannot marry <HI>any</HI> man; and as a late extraordinary &s;tep taken by her, has &s;hewn, that there is at pre&s;ent too much rea&s;on to attend to the weight of her plea; it is hoped, that the Count of Belvedere, for his own &s;ake; for the &s;ake of the compo&s;ure of mind of the Lady, &s;o dear to all who have the honour of knowing her; will re&s;olve to di&s;con|tinue his addre&s;&s;es to her, and engage never to think of re&s;uming them, unle&s;s &s;ome hopes
<PB N="171" REF="172">
&s;hould ari&s;e, in cour&s;e of time, of his &s;ucceed|ing in her favour by her own con&s;ent.</P>
<P N="5">V. Her ever-honoured parents, for them&s;elves and for their ab&s;ent brother the Count of Porretta; her right reverend brother for him&s;elf, and, as far as he may, for his elder brother; Signor Je|ronymo for him&s;elf; will be &s;o good as to pro|mi&s;e, that they will never with earne&s;tne&s;s en|deavour to per&s;uade, much le&s;s to compel, Lady Clementina to marry any man whatever; nor encourage her Camilla, or any other friend or confident, to endeavour to prevail upon her to change her condition: Her parents, however, re&s;erving to them&s;elves the right of propo&s;ing, as they &s;hall think fit, but not of urging; be|cau&s;e the young Lady, who is by nature &s;weet|tempered, gentle, obliging, dutiful, thinks her|&s;elf (however determined by inclination) le&s;s a|ble to with&s;tand the per&s;ua&s;ions of indulgent friends, than &s;he &s;hould be to re&s;i&s;t the mo&s;t de|&s;potic commands.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The&s;e terms conceded to, on all &s;ides, it is humbly propo&s;ed, that the young Lady &s;hall throw her&s;elf (as &s;he is impatient to do) at the feet of her indulgent parents; and that all acts of di&s;obligation &s;hall be buried in everla&s;ting ob|livion.</P>
<P>The propo&s;er of the above &s;ix articles takes the liberty to add, on the pre&s;umption that they may be carried into effect, that his noble gue&s;ts will allow him to rejoice with them on their mutual happine&s;s re&s;tored, for months to come, in his native country.</P>
<P>He hopes that they will accept of his endeavours to make England as agreeable to them, as they heretofore made Italy to him.</P>
<P>He begs that they will con&s;ider their family and his,
<PB N="172" REF="173">
as one family, ever to be united by the indi&s;|&s;oluble ties of true friendly Love.</P>
<P>He hopes for their company at his country &s;eat.</P>
<P>He will &s;eek for opportunities to oblige and ac|commodate them in every article, whether de|votional or dome&s;tic.</P>
<P>And when they will be no longer prevailed upon to &s;tay in England, he will (no accidents, no events, preventing, of which them&s;elves &s;hall be judges) attend them to Italy; and if his beloved Wife and Si&s;ters, and their Lords, &s;hall have made to them&s;elves, as he hopes they will, an intere&s;t in their affections, he que&s;tions not to prevail on them to be of the party.</P>

<P>LADY L. when I was &s;et down at her hou&s;e, told me, that Lady Clementina had been in great agitations on the contents of the propo&s;als left with her. She kept her chamber all day ye&s;terday, and this morning. Lady L. had then but ju&s;t left her. I &s;ent up my compliments to her. She de&s;ired me to walk up. She met me on the &s;tair-head in tears; and led me into her dre&s;&s;ing-room&mdash;Have you &s;een the Chevalier's propo&s;als, madam?&mdash;I owned I had.</P>
<P>&mdash;Give up for ever, &s;aid &s;he, my &s;cheme, my darling &s;cheme, for the &s;ake of which, I&mdash;There &s;he &s;topt.</P>
<P>It was ea&s;y to gue&s;s what the poor Lady was going to &s;ay. The &s;ubject was too delicate for me to help her out.</P>
<P>Deare&s;t Lady Clementina, &s;aid I, be plea&s;ed to con&s;ider the good it will be in your power to do to hundreds, according to the &s;econd article, if you <HI>can</HI> comply. How much has our dear Friend con&s;ulted your beneficent &s;pirit! All my fear is, that your pa|rents will not &s;ub&s;cribe to their part of it. If they <HI>will,</HI> what a favourite &s;cheme of their own will they give up!</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed&mdash;Then breaking &s;ilence&mdash;And is it your opinion, Lady Grandi&s;on? Your opinion, join|ed to the Chevalier's&mdash;Let me con&s;ider&mdash;</P>
<P>She took two or three turns about the room: Then, thinking of Sir Charles's intimation of a tour to Ita|ly&mdash;With what &s;oothing, what con&s;oling hope, &s;aid &s;he, does the next-to-divine man almo&s;t conciliate my mind to his mea&s;ures!&mdash;And could you, would you, madam, think of going with us to Italy? O how flattering are the&s;e hints!</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="175">
I &s;hould rejoice in &s;uch a tour, replied I: Love me but in your Italy, if I &s;hould be allowed to go, as I do you in our England, and I &s;hall be happy in &s;o fine a country, as I am told it is. But, deare&s;t Lady, what &s;hall we do to obtain your friends compliance with the&s;e articles? Shall I ca&s;t my&s;elf on my knees before your father and mother to beg theirs?

<P>SIR Charles returned with a benevolent joy bright|ening his countenance. He hopes to bring this affair to an i&s;&s;ue not unhappy.</P>
<P>He was fir&s;t with the Count of Belvedere, who re|ceived him with great emotion. I apprehended, &s;aid he, that I was to be the &s;acrifice. O Grandi&s;on, did you but know the hopes, the a&s;&s;urances, given me by the General, by every-body!</P>
<P>Sir Charles expatiated on every argument that could compo&s;e his mind.</P>
<P>Will &s;he promi&s;e, will &s;he engage, that if ever &s;he marry, it will be the man before you, Chevalier? Why did you not make that a &s;tipulation in my fa|vour?</P>
<P>I think &s;uch a &s;tipulation would be of di&s;advantage
<PB N="175" REF="176">
to your Lord&s;hip: You would be kept by it in &s;u&s;|pence, whatever had offered, whether in Italy or Spain; in both which countries you have con&s;iderable connexions.

If otherwi&s;e, your Lord&s;hip (un|fettered either by hope or obligation) will be free to make another choice.</P>
<P><HI>Another choice,</HI> Sir!&mdash;This to a man, who has &s;o long adored her; and, thro' the various turns of her unhappy malady, &s;till pre&s;erved for her a Love that never any other woman &s;hared in!&mdash;But, if you plea&s;e, we will hear what her father, her mother, and other friends, &s;ay to the articles you have drawn up.</P>
<P>They went to them. After dinner the important &s;ubject had a full and &s;olemn con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Signor Jeronymo and Mrs. Beaumont only at fir&s;t e&s;pou&s;ed the propo&s;ed plan in <HI>all</HI> its articles; but every-body came into it at la&s;t. God be prai&s;ed!

<P>As Sir Charles and I were &s;itting at &s;upper, &s;weetly alone; the whole world, as it &s;eemed, to each other (for Mrs. Grandi&s;on choo&s;es to be at pre&s;ent at Lord L's, and was gone thither); the following Billet was brought me, written in Italian; which thus I Engli&s;h:</P>

<P>NOW for particulars of what pa&s;&s;ed ye&s;terday. Sir Charles is gone to Gro&s;venor-Square, to en|quire after the health and compo&s;ure of his noble gue&s;ts there.</P>
<P>When I called upon Lady Clementina ye&s;terday, five o'clock, I found her greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with her
<PB N="179" REF="180">
own apprehen&s;ions. I mu&s;t, &s;aid &s;he to me, be a guiltier creature than I had allowed my&s;elf to think I was: Why el&s;e am I &s;o a&s;hamed, &s;o afraid, to &s;ee parents whom I ever honoured, brothers and friends whom I ever loved?&mdash;O Lady Grandi&s;on! What a di&s;piriting thing is the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having done ami&s;s! And to a proud heart too!</P>
<P>Then looking upon the written plan, Let me &s;ee, &s;aid &s;he, what I am to &s;ign. The&s;e were the remarks &s;he made upon them, as &s;he read:</P>
<P N="1">(1.) Hard, hard article, <HI>the fir&s;t!</HI> But your Gran|di&s;on, madam, my fourth brother, my friend, my protector, tells me, that I &s;hall di&s;charge all the obli|gations he ever laid upon me, if I will &s;ign it.&mdash;I &s;ubmit.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) How flattering to my pride; to my hopes of doing good to the indigent and unhappy!</P>
<P N="3">(3.) Nominating my attendants&mdash;my confe&s;&s;or&mdash;Kind, con&s;iderate Grandi&s;on! If I give up the fir&s;t wi&s;h of my heart, I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t upon the&s;e &s;tipu|lations in my favour. My parents &s;hall have, in the&s;e ca&s;es, affirmative and negative too. Indeed I de&s;ire not in any article to be independent of them.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) A grateful article! I acknowlege, Chevalier, your protection with gratitude, in this &s;tipulation.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) If my friends promi&s;e, they will perform. Ours is a family of untainted honour. I hope my Brother Giacomo will be an&s;wered for by <HI>his</HI> Brothers in the&s;e articles: But he will hate me, I fear.</P>
<P>Generous Grandi&s;on! what tempting propo&s;als do you conclude with! And you, Lady Grandi&s;on, are &s;o good as to &s;ay, that my happine&s;s is wanting to complete yours&mdash;That is a motive, I a&s;&s;ure you. Lead me, madam, and do you, my dear Lady L. (my ho&s;pitable other protectre&s;s) oblige me with your countenance too. A woman of your honour and goodne&s;s, Si&s;ter of the Chevalier Grandi&s;on, acknow|leging me your gue&s;t, and an&s;wering for my behaviour,
<PB N="180" REF="181">
will credit the abject Clementina in the eyes of her forgiving relations.&mdash;Sir Charles Grandi&s;on there be|fore me, to prepare them to receive graciou&s;ly the fu|gitive!&mdash;Lead me on, while I can be led: I will at|tend you.</P>
<P>She looked wild and di&s;ordered; and, giving each of us a hand, we led her to the coach. But, at &s;tep|ping in, &s;he trembled, faltered, and &s;eemed greatly di&s;turbed. We con&s;oled her all we could; and the coach drove to Gro&s;venor-Square. When it &s;topt, &s;he threw her arms about Lady L. and, hiding her face in her bo&s;om, called upon the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin to &s;upport her&mdash;How, how, &s;aid &s;he, can I look my Fa|ther, my Mother, in the face!</P>
<P>Sir Charles, on the coach &s;topping, appeared. He &s;aw her emotion. It is kind, my Harriet! It is kind, Lady L. to accompany Lady Clementina.&mdash;Your goodne&s;s will be rewarded in being eye-witne&s;&s;es of the mo&s;t gracious reception that ever indulgent pa|rents gave to a long ab&s;ent daughter.</P>
<P>Ah, Chevalier! was all &s;he could &s;ay.</P>
<P>Let me conduct you, deare&s;t Lady Clementina, into a drawing-room, where you will &s;ee no other per&s;on but whom you now &s;ee, till your recovered &s;pirits &s;hall rejoice the deare&s;t of friends.</P>
<P>I was afraid &s;he was too much di&s;compo&s;ed to at|tend to this con&s;iderate expedient. I repeated, there|fore, what Sir Charles la&s;t &s;aid. She was vi&s;ibly en|couraged by it. She gave him her trembling hand; and he led her into the prepared drawing-room. Lady L. and I followed, and took our &s;eats on each hand of her; Sir Charles his over-again&s;t her. Our of|fered &s;alts, and &s;oothing, with difficulty kept her from fainting.</P>
<P>When &s;he was a little revived&mdash;Hu&s;h! &s;aid &s;he, with her finger held up, and wildne&s;s in her looks, ca&s;ting her eyes to the doors and windows in turn: They will hear us!&mdash;Further recovering her&s;elf&mdash;O
<PB N="181" REF="182">
Chevalier! &s;aid &s;he, what &s;hall I &s;ay? How &s;hall I look? What &s;hall I do?&mdash;And am I, am I, indeed, in the &s;ame hou&s;e with my Father, Mother, Jero|nymo? Who el&s;e? Who el&s;e? with quickne&s;s.</P>
<P>It is &s;o ordered, my deare&s;t Clementina, &s;aid Sir Charles, in love and tenderne&s;s to you, that you &s;hall only &s;ee your Mother fir&s;t; then your Father&mdash;At your own plea&s;ure, your Brothers, Mrs. Beaumont, Father Mare&s;cotti.</P>
<P>Sir Charles was &s;ent for out&mdash;Don't, don't leave me, Sir. Then looking to Lady L. and then to me&mdash;You are all goodne&s;s, Ladies&mdash;Don't leave me.</P>
<P>Sir Charles in&s;tantly returned: Your Mamma, ma|dam, all indulgence, is impatient to fold you to her heart. What joy will you give her?</P>
<P>He offered his hand. She gave him hers; mo|tioning for out attendance. Sir Charles led her, we following, into the room where was her expecting Mother. The moment each &s;aw the other, they ran with open arms to each other. O my Mamma!&mdash;My Clementina!&mdash;was all that either could &s;ay. They &s;unk down on the floor, the Mother's arms about the Daughter's neck; the Daughter's about the Mother's wai&s;t.</P>
<P>Sir Charles lifted them up, and &s;eated them clo&s;e to each other&mdash;Pardon! Pardon! Pardon! &s;aid the dear Lady, hands and eyes lifted up, &s;liding out of her Mother's arms on her knees&mdash;But at that moment could &s;ay no more.</P>
<P>The Marquis, not being able longer to contain him|&s;elf, ru&s;hed in&mdash;My Daughter! my Child! my Cle|mentina! Once more do I &s;ee my Child!</P>
<P>Sir Charles had half-lifted her up, when her Father entered. She &s;unk down again, pro&s;trate on the floor, her arms extended: O my Father! Forgive!&mdash;Forgive me, O my Father!</P>
<P>He rai&s;ed her up, by Sir Charles's a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and, &s;eating her between him&s;elf and his Lady, both again
<PB N="182" REF="183">
wrapt their arms about her. She repeated prayers for forgivene&s;s, in broken accents: Ble&s;&s;ings, in accents as broken, flowed from their hearts to their lips.</P>
<P>After the fir&s;t emotions, when they could &s;peak, and &s;he now-and-then could look up, which &s;he did by &s;natches, as it were, her eyes pre&s;ently falling un|der theirs, Behold, madam, Behold, my Lord, &s;aid &s;he, the ho&s;pitable Lady to whom&mdash;Looking at Lady L. Behold, looking at me, a more than woman; an Angel&mdash;More &s;he would have &s;aid; but &s;eemed at a lo&s;s for words.</P>
<P>We have before &s;een and admired, &s;aid the Mar|quis, in Lady Grandi&s;on, the noble&s;t of all women.</P>
<P>He aro&s;e to approach us: Sir Charles led us both to them.</P>
<P>Lady Clementina &s;natched fir&s;t my hand, and eagerly pre&s;&s;ed it with her lips; then Lady L's: Her heart was full: She &s;eemed to want to &s;peak; but could not: And Lady L. and I, with overflowing eyes, congratulated the Father, Mother, Daughter; and were ble&s;&s;ed in &s;peech by the two former; by hands and eyes lifted up, by Lady Clementina.</P>
<P>Sir Charles then withdrawing, returned with the Bi&s;hop, and Signor Jeronymo. It is hard to &s;ay, whether the&s;e two Lords &s;hewed more joy, than Cle|mentina did &s;hame and confu&s;ion. She offered at begging pardon: But the Bi&s;hop &s;aid, Not one word of pa&s;t afflictions! Nobody is in fault. We are all happy once more; and happy on the conditions pre|&s;cribed to both by this friend of mankind in general, and of our family in particular.</P>
<P>My ever noble, my venerable brother, &s;aid Jero|nymo (who had cla&s;ped his Si&s;ter to his fond heart, his eyes running over) how I love you for this un|called for a&s;&s;urance to the dear Clementina! Every article of my Grandi&s;on's plan &s;hall be carried into execution. We will rejoice with the Chevalier in his England&mdash;And he, and all who are dear to him, &s;hall accompany us to Italy. We will be all one family.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="184">
Sir Charles then introduced to the Lady his greatly and ju&s;tly e&s;teemed Mrs. Beaumont. Clementina threw her&s;elf into her arms. Forgive me, my dear Mrs. Beaumont! If <HI>you</HI> forgive me, <HI>Virtue</HI> will. Pardon the poor creature, who never, never, would have &s;o much di&s;graced your le&s;&s;ons, and her mam|ma's example, as &s;he has done, had not a heavy cloud darkened her unhappy mind. Say you forgive me, as the be&s;t and mo&s;t indulgent of parents, and the kinde&s;t of brothers, have done.</P>
<P>It was not your fault, my dear Lady Clementina, but your misfortune. You never was &s;o much to be blamed as pitied. All here are of one &s;entiment. We came over to heal your wounded mind: Be it healed, and every one will be happy; yes, more hap|py perhaps (for now we all under&s;tand one another,) than if you had not left us to mourn your ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ed be my Comforter, my Friend, my beloved Mrs. Beaumont! You always knew how to blunt the keen edge of calamity: What a &s;uperior woman are you!</P>
<P>Father Mare&s;cotti was introduced by the Marquis him&s;elf, with a re&s;pect worthy of his piety and good|ne&s;s. I &s;ubmit, Father, &s;aid Lady Clementina, be|fore he could &s;peak, to any penance you &s;hall inflict.</P>
<P>His voice would not befriend him: His action, however, &s;hewed him to be all joy and congratulation.</P>
<P>I have been wicked, very wicked, continued &s;he&mdash;But Mrs. Beaumont &s;ays, and &s;he &s;ays ju&s;tly, that I merited pity, rather than blame. Yet if you think not &s;o, you, who are the keeper of my con&s;cience, &s;pare me not.</P>
<P>Who, who, &s;aid the good man recovering &s;peech, &s;hall condemn, when father, mother, and brothers, &s;o zealous for the honour of their family, acquit! God forgive you, my deare&s;t Lady! And God for|give us all!</P>
<P>My deare&s;t Chevalier Grandi&s;on, &s;aid Jeronymo,
<PB N="184" REF="185">
what gratitude, what obligations, do we owe to you, and your admirable Lady and Si&s;ters! Again I ac|knowlege the obligation for a whole family, from this hour a happy one, I hope.</P>
<P>It had been agreed between the family and Sir Charles, that not a word &s;hould be mentioned to Lady Clementina of the Count of Belvedere. They reque&s;ted Sir Charles to take upon him&s;elf the break|ing to her, that he was in England, in his own man|ner, as opportunity &s;hould offer.</P>
<P>Every one having been greatly affected, Sir Charles propo&s;ed to take leave; and that Lady Clementina &s;hould return to Lady L's for that night, as prepara|tion might not have been made for her &s;tay in Gro&s;|venor-Square: But all the family, with one voice, declared they could not part with the re&s;tored daughter and &s;i&s;ter of their hopes: And &s;he her&s;elf chearfully con&s;ented to &s;tay; gratefully, however, with a bent knee, thanking Lady L. for her &s;i&s;terly treatment.</P>
<P>Who, in the general joy, &s;aid Sir Charles, has remembred the good Camilla? Let Camilla congra|tulate her Lady and all of us, on this happy occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Every-one called out for Camilla. In ran the worthy creature. On her knees &s;he embraced her young Lady's, and wept for joy. Ah! my Camilla, my friend Camilla! &s;aid Clementina, cla&s;ping her arms about her neck, I have been cruel to you: But it was not I&mdash;Alas! alas! I was not always my&s;elf&mdash;I will endeavour to repair your wrongs.</P>
<P>Thank God that I once more cla&s;p my dear young Lady to my heart!&mdash;I have no wrongs to complain of.</P>
<P>Yes, yes, you have, kind Camilla: I wanted to elude your watchful duty; and was too cunning to be <HI>ju&s;t</HI> to my Camilla.</P>
<P>Sir Charles forgot not to commend Laura to for|givene&s;s and favour. Laura, &s;aid Lady Clementina, is blamele&s;s. She obeyed me with reluctance. If I am <HI>my&s;elf</HI> forgiven, forgive Laura.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="186">
My deare&s;t Love, &s;aid the Marchione&s;s, we have agreed, that you &s;hall choo&s;e your own &s;ervants. The Chevalier, we have no doubt, had Laura in his thoughts, when he made that &s;tipulation; the Engli&s;h youth too. You, my Clementina, mu&s;t have it in your power to do with the&s;e as you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>May I be permitted, my Lords, &s;aid Sir Charles, to make one reque&s;t for my&s;elf to Lady Clementina; a reque&s;t which &s;hall be con&s;i&s;tent with the articles you will all &s;ign?</P>
<P>I will agree to a reque&s;t of yours, Chevalier, &s;aid the Lady, be it almo&s;t what it will.</P>
<P>I will not, madam, make it to-day, nor to-morrow. After the hurry of &s;pirits we have all &s;u&s;tained, let to|morrow be a day of compo&s;ure. Permit me to expect you all at dinner with me on Friday. The articles then may be &s;igned: And then, but not before, I will mention my reque&s;t, and hope it will be granted.</P>
<P>Sir Charles's invitation was politely accepted; and to-morrow&mdash;</P>
<P>Lady Clementina and Mrs. Beaumont below!&mdash;Agreeable &s;urprize!</P>
<P>SIR Charles had been out, and was ju&s;t come in when the two Ladies alighted. I was overjoyed to &s;ee them, and to &s;ee Lady Clementina &s;erene, and &s;eem|ingly not unhappy. We are come, &s;aid Mrs. Beau|mont, to make our earlie&s;t acknowlegements for the happine&s;s re&s;tored to a whole family. Lady Clemen|tina could not be ea&s;y till &s;he had paid her per&s;onal thanks to Lady Grandi&s;on, for the &s;upport her pre|&s;ence gave her ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>Gratitude, &s;aid the Lady, fills my her: But how, Chevalier, &s;hall I expre&s;s it? I be&s;eech you, let me know your reque&s;t. Tell me, dear Lady Grandi&s;on, wherein I can oblige my fourth brother?</P>
<P>My deare&s;t Lady Clementina, &s;aid Sir Charles, for|tify your heart again&s;t a gentle (I hope it will then be
<PB N="186" REF="187">
<HI>but</HI> a gentle) &s;urprize. <HI>You</HI> have not yet &s;igned, your <HI>Relations</HI> have not, I pre&s;ume, the articles to which you have mutually agreed.</P>
<P>Sir! Chevalier! Sir!</P>
<P>Let me not alarm you, madam.</P>
<P>He put one of her hands in mine; and took the other in a very tender manner, in his.</P>
<P><HI>You</HI> intend to &s;ign them?&mdash;<HI>They</HI> do, I am &s;ure. To-morrow, when we are all together, they will be &s;igned on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>I hope &s;o&mdash;They will not, Chevalier, be receded from?</P>
<P>They will not, madam: And hence you will be a&s;&s;ured, that the Count of Belvedere will never be propo&s;ed to you with any degree of urgency.</P>
<P>I hope not, I hope not, &s;aid &s;he with quickne&s;s.</P>
<P>Should you, madam, on your return to Italy, be unwilling to &s;ee the Count as a friend of your family, as a re&s;pecter of your great qualities, as a country|man?</P>
<P>I &s;hall always regard the Count of Belvedere as a man of honour, as a friend of my Brother Giacomo, of all our family&mdash;But I cannot place him in any other light. What <HI>means</HI> the Chevalier Grandi&s;on? Keep not my mind in &s;u&s;pen&s;e.</P>
<P>I will <HI>not.</HI> Your father, your mother, your bro|thers, came over in hopes, that you might be pre|vailed upon in the Count's favour. They have given up that hope&mdash;</P>
<P>They have, Sir!</P>
<P>And will ab&s;olutely leave you to your own will, to your own wi&s;hes, on the condition to which you have agreed to &s;ign&mdash;But <HI>&s;hall</HI> I a&s;k you&mdash;Were the Count to be in France, would you allow him to come over, and take leave of your family and you, before he &s;ets out for the court of Madrid?</P>
<P>What, Sir! as a man who had hopes from me of <HI>more</HI> than my good wi&s;hes?</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="188">
No, madam; only as a friend to the whole family&mdash;not reque&s;ting any other favour, now he &s;ees you &s;o determined, than your good wi&s;hes, your prayers, for him, as you will ever have his for you.</P>
<P>I can con&s;ent in that view: But were any other favour to be hoped from me; were my genero&s;ity to be expected to be prevailed upon&mdash;O Chevalier! Lady Grandi&s;on! Mrs. Beaumont! Let me not be attempted in this way: The articles would be broken: This would be <HI>per&s;ua&s;ion,</HI> and <HI>that</HI> compul&s;ion.</P>
<P>Nothing, madam, of this kind is intended. The articles will be inviolably ob&s;erved on the part of your relations. But here Mrs. Beaumont, who never in|tended to &s;et her foot on the Engli&s;h &s;hore, to oblige and comfort your mother, is come to England: And in the general grief that was occa&s;ioned by your ab|&s;enting your&s;elf, if the man, who was always de&s;ervedly e&s;teemed by your family, <HI>had</HI> accompanied, had at|tended, your father, your brothers&mdash;</P>
<P>Sir Charles &s;topt, and looked at the apprehen&s;ive Lady with <HI>&s;uch</HI> a &s;weet benignity, and, on her eye meeting his, with <HI>&s;uch</HI> tender and downca&s;t mode&s;ty (all the graces of gentle per&s;ua&s;ion are his!)&mdash;</P>
<P>O Chevalier! your reque&s;t! your reque&s;t! Tell me in what I can oblige the mo&s;t obliging of friends, of men!</P>
<P>I will tell you, madam&mdash;bowing on the hand he held&mdash;Con&s;ent, if it be not with too much pain to your&s;elf, to &s;ee the Count of Belvedere.</P>
<P>See him, Sir! How? When? Where? As what?</P>
<P>As a friend to your family&mdash;a well-wi&s;her to your glory, your happine&s;s; and as a man ready and de|&s;irous to promote the latter at the expence of his own. He wi&s;hes but, while he &s;tays here&mdash;</P>
<P>"Stays here," Sir!</P>
<P>To be allowed to vi&s;it your family, and to &s;ee you once, twice, thrice, as you plea&s;e&mdash;but entirely un|der the conditions of the articles to be &s;igned to-mor|row.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="189">
And is then the Count in England?</P>
<P>He is, madam. He attended his and your friends over. He has not once de&s;ired to appear in your pre|&s;ence: He keeps him&s;elf clo&s;e in private lodgings. Hence judge of his re&s;olution not to di&s;turb or offend you. He will depart the kingdom without an inter|view, if you will have it &s;o: But I could not bear, that &s;o good a man &s;hould be obliged to depart <HI>di&s;|gracefully,</HI> as I may &s;ay, and as if he were unde&s;erving of pity, tho' he could not obtain favour.</P>
<P>O Chevalier!</P>
<P>Secured, madam, by the articles, tho' <HI>his</HI> emo|tion may be apprehended to be great, <HI>yours</HI> cannot&mdash;There is not the &s;ame rea&s;on for the one as for the other: I make it <HI>my</HI> reque&s;t, that the Count of Bel|vedere may be allowed, as one of the cho&s;en friends of your hou&s;e, but as no more <HI>(more</HI> the articles for|bid) a place at my table to-morrow.</P>
<P>To-morrow, Sir! and I at it!&mdash;</P>
<P>He bowed affirmatively.</P>
<P>O how the penetrating man looked into the heart of the Lady at her eyes!&mdash;As &s;ure us you are alive, madam, he thought of gue&s;&s;ing by her then emotion, whether any hopes could di&s;tantly lie for the Count, by the con&s;equence his pre&s;ence or ab&s;ence would give him with her.</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed&mdash;At la&s;t&mdash;And is <HI>this,</HI> Chevalier, the reque&s;t you had to make me?</P>
<P>It is, madam; and if my Harriet had not had the honour of this vi&s;it, I &s;hould have made the &s;ame re|que&s;t for his admi&s;&s;ion in the evening to-morrow&mdash;as now I do to dinner.</P>
<P>Well, Sir; I can &s;u&s;pect no double-dealing from Sir Charles Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>I a&s;k for no favour for the Count more than I have mentioned, madam: I am bound by the articles I have drawn, as if I were a party to them.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, I con&s;ent to &s;ee the Count. He will
<PB N="189" REF="190">
be prudent. I hope I &s;hall be &s;o. In Italy, more than once, after you had left it, I &s;aw him: And I always wi&s;hed him happy.</P>
<P>Now, my deare&s;t Si&s;ter, &s;aid Sir Charles, my ever-to-be-re&s;pected friend, I am ea&s;y in my mind. I could not bear in my thoughts, that any-thing <HI>I</HI> knew, which it concerned <HI>you</HI> to know, &s;hould be concealed from you.</P>
<P>Tears &s;tood in her eyes. O madam, &s;aid &s;he to me, God and you only can reward this excellent man for his goodne&s;s to me, and all the world that know him.&mdash;You &s;ee your influence, Chevalier. In every way do I wi&s;h to &s;hew my gratitude. But never, never, a&s;k me to give my hand in marriage.</P>
<P>Ah! my dear Lady! thought I; a tear &s;tealing involuntarily down my cheek; the <HI>le&s;s,</HI> the <HI>le&s;s,</HI> I doubt, mu&s;t you be a&s;ked, for having before you a man, who having no equal, you cannot think of any other.</P>
<P>The two Ladies hurried away to Lady L's. How &s;incerely has the friendly heart of dear Lady L. been affected in all the&s;e tender &s;cenes!</P>

di&s;appointed!&mdash;Poor mortals! how hard to be plea&s;ed!</P>
<P>The brave are always humane. Sir Charles's tender and polite behaviour on this occa&s;ion&mdash;How does every occurrence endear him to every-body!</P>
<P>How dearly does Lord G. love his Charlotte! Till all was over, he was in agonies for her &s;afety. His prayers then, his thankfulne&s;s now, how ought they to endear them to his Charlotte! And &s;o they mu&s;t, when &s;he is told of his anxiety, and of his hone&s;t joy, or I will not own her for my Si&s;ter. But in her <HI>heart,</HI> I am &s;ure, &s;he loves him. Her pa&s;t idle be|haviour to him was but play. She will be matro|nized now. The <HI>mother</HI> mu&s;t make her a <HI>wife.</HI> She will doubly di&s;grace her&s;elf, if &s;he loves her <HI>child,</HI> and can make a je&s;t of her <HI>hu&s;band.</HI></P>
<P>I have ju&s;t now a&s;ked Sir Charles, whether, if he <HI>could</HI> prevail on Lady Clementina, while they were all with us, to give her hand to the Count of Belve|dere, he would? By no means, &s;aid he, and that for both their &s;akes. Lady Clementina has, on many occa&s;ions, &s;hewn that &s;he <HI>may</HI> be prevailed upon by generous and patient treatment: Let the Count have patience. If &s;he recover her mind, a train of chear|ful ideas may take place of tho&s;e melancholy ones, which make her de&s;irous of quitting &s;ociety. She will find her&s;elf, by the articles agreed to, in a &s;ituation to do more good, than it is po&s;&s;ible &s;he could do, were her inclination to take the veil to be gratified. The good &s;he will do, will open and enlarge a mind which is naturally noble; and &s;he will be grateful for the indulgence given her, which will be the means of &s;o happy a change: But if the poor Lady's mind be not curable (which God forbid!) who will pity the Count for not being able to obtain her hand?&mdash;I think, my dear, I have made him, tho' not happy, ea&s;y; and I hope he will be able to &s;ee her without violent emotions.</P>

<P>Sincerely do I rejoice in the news which my Nan|cy confirms, that Lucy has ab&s;olutely rejected the ad|dre&s;&s;es of Mr. Greville. She &s;tartled me once, I can tell her: A naughty girl! what could &s;he mean by it?</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Sat. March <HI>31.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>NOW, my dear grandmamma, let me give you &s;ome account of what pa&s;&s;ed ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>The Articles &s;igned and witne&s;&s;ed, were put into Lady Clementina's hand, and a pen given her, that &s;he might write her name, in the pre&s;ence of all her &s;urrounding friends here.</P>
<P>Never woman appeared with more dignity in her air and manner. She was charmingly dre&s;&s;ed, and became her dre&s;s. A truly lovely woman! But eve|ry one by looks &s;eemed concerned at her &s;olemnity. She &s;igned her name; but tore off, deliberately, their names; and ki&s;&s;ing the torn bit, put it in her bo|&s;om: Then, throwing her&s;elf on her knees to her father and mother, who &s;tood together, and pre&s;ent|ing the paper to the former; Never let it be &s;aid, that your child, your Clementina, has pre&s;umed to article in form with the deare&s;t of parents. <HI>My</HI> name &s;tands. It will be a witne&s;s again&s;t me, if I break the articles which I have &s;igned. But in your for|givene&s;s, my Lord, in yours, madam, and in a thou|&s;and acts of indulgence, I have too much experienced your pa&s;t, to doubt your future, goodne&s;s to me. Your intention, my ever honoured parents, is your act. I pray to God to enable your Clementina to be all you wi&s;h her to be. In the &s;ingle Life only in|dulge me. Your word is all the a&s;&s;urance I wi&s;h for. I will have no other.</P>
<P>They embraced her. They tenderly rai&s;ed her between them; and again embraced her.</P>
<P>I would not, methinks, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, turning to Sir Charles, for the fir&s;t time &s;ee the Count of Bel|vedere before all this company, tho' I revere every one in it. Is the Count in the hou&s;e?</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="194">
He is in my Study, madam.</P>
<P>Will my mamma, &s;aid &s;he, turning to her, honour me with her pre&s;ence?</P>
<P>She gave her hand to Sir Charles, and took mine.&mdash;Jeronymo followed her; and Sir Charles led her into the next room. Too great &s;olemnity in all this! whi&s;per|ed the Marquis to Father Mare&s;cotti. She courtefied, invitingly, to Mrs Beaumont. She al&s;o followed her.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, &s;eating her and the Marchione&s;s, by the young Lady's &s;ilent permi&s;&s;ion, went into his Study; and, having prepared the Count to expect a &s;olemn and uncommon reception, introduced him. He approached her, profoundly bowing: A &s;weet blu&s;h over&s;pread her cheeks&punc; You, my Lord of Bel|vedere, &s;aid &s;he, are one of tho&s;e my friends, to whom I am, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, accountable for the ra&s;h &s;tep which brought me into this kingdom; be|cau&s;e it has induced you to accompany my brothers, whom you have always honoured with your friend|&s;hip.&mdash;Forgive me for any inconveniencies you have &s;uffered on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>What honour does Lady Clementina do me to rank me in the number of the friends to whom &s;he thinks her&s;elf accountable!&mdash;Believe me, madam&mdash;</P>
<P>My Lord, interrupted &s;he, I &s;hall always regard you as the friend of my family, and as <HI>my</HI> friend. I &s;hall wi&s;h your happine&s;s, I <HI>do</HI> wi&s;h your happine&s;s, as my own; and I cannot give you a better proof that I do, than by with-holding from you the hand which you have &s;ought to obtain with an un&s;haken, and my friends think, an obliging per&s;everance, quite thro' an unhappy malady, which ought to have deterred you, for many &s;akes, and mo&s;t for your own.</P>
<P>My dear mamma, throwing her&s;elf at her feet, forgive me for <HI>my</HI> per&s;everance. It is not altogether owing (I hope it is not at <HI>all</HI> owing) to perver&s;ene&s;s, and to a wilful re&s;i&s;tance of the wills and wi&s;hes of all my friends, that I have with&s;tood you. Two rea&s;ons
<PB N="194" REF="195">
influenced me, when I declined <HI>another</HI> hand: Reli|gion and Country, a double rea&s;on, was one; the un|happy malady which had &s;eized me, was another. <HI>Two rea&s;ons,</HI> ri&s;ing with dignity, and turning from her weeping mother, al&s;o influence me with regard to the Count of Belvedere; tho' neither of them are the important articles of Religion and Country. I own to you, before the&s;e my deare&s;t friends, and let it be told to every one concerned to know it, that ju&s;tice to the Count of Belvedere is one&mdash;What a wretch &s;hould I be, if I gave my hand to a man who had not the preference in my heart, which is a hu&s;band's due!&mdash;And &s;hould I, who had an unhappy rea&s;on to refu&s;e one worthy man for his <HI>own</HI> &s;ake, perhaps for the &s;akes of the unborn (I will &s;peak out on this impor|tant occa&s;ion) not be determined to do as much ju&s;tice to another?&mdash;In one word, I refu&s;ed to puni&s;h the Chevalier Grandi&s;on [Madam, to me, you know my &s;tory]: What has the Count of Belvedere done, that I &s;hould make no &s;cruple to puni&s;h him? My good Lord, be &s;atisfied with my wi&s;hes for your hap|pine&s;s. I find my&s;elf, at times, very, very wrong. I have given proofs but too convincing to all my friends, that I am not right.&mdash;While I &s;o think, con&s;cience, ho|nour, ju&s;tice (as I told <HI>you</HI> once before, my good Che|valier) compel me to embrace the Single Life.&mdash;I have, in duty to my neare&s;t friends, given up the way I &s;hould have cho&s;en to lead it in&mdash;Let me try to recover my&s;elf in their way. My deare&s;t, deare&s;t, mamma (again dropping on her knees to her) I will endeavour to make all my friends happy in the way they have agreed to make me &s;o. Pray for me, all my friends!&mdash;looking round her, tears in big drops trickling down her cheeks. Then ri&s;ing, Pray for me, my Lord of Belvedere: I will for you; and that you may do ju&s;tice to the merit of &s;ome worthier woman, who <HI>can</HI> do ju&s;tice to yours.</P>
<P>She hurried from us, in a way which &s;hewed &s;he
<PB N="195" REF="196">
was too much elevated for her corporal powers. Sir Charles be&s;ought Mrs. Beaumont to follow her. Mrs. Beaumont took my hand.</P>
<P>We found the Lady in the Study: She was on her knees, and in tears. She aro&s;e at our entrance Each of us ha&s;tening to give her a hand, O my dear Lady Grandi&s;on, &s;aid &s;he, forgive me.&mdash;My dear Mrs. Beaumont, am I, am I wrong? Tell me, Have I be|haved ami&s;s?</P>
<P>We both applauded her. Well we might. If her greatne&s;s be owing to a rai&s;ed imagination, who &s;hall call it a malady? Who, but for the dear Lady's own &s;ake, would regret the next-to-divine impul&s;e, by which, on &s;everal occa&s;ions, &s;he has &s;hewn her|&s;elf actuated?</P>
<P>She &s;uffered her&s;elf to be led to her mother, who embracing her (Clementina again kneeling to her) My deare&s;t child, my ble&s;&s;ed daughter, we all of us, while &s;uch are your apprehen&s;ions, mu&s;t acquie&s;ce with your rea&s;ons. Be happy, my Love, in your own magnanimity. I glory in my child.</P>
<P>And I in my Si&s;ter, &s;aid the noble Jeronymo&mdash;Saint! Angel! kneeling to her on one knee, not|with&s;tanding his lamene&s;s, I next to adore my Si&s;ter.</P>
<P>She called him her brother, her true brother. Then, taking my hand; And will <HI>you,</HI> Lady Grandi&s;on, &s;aid &s;he, be my Si&s;ter? Shall Sir Charles Grandi&s;on be my Brother? Will you return with us into Italy? Shall we cultivate on both &s;ides a family-friend&s;hip to the end of our lives?</P>
<P>I threw my arms about her neck, tears mingling on the cheeks of both: It will be my ambition, my <HI>great</HI> ambition, to de&s;erve the di&s;tinction you give me&mdash;My Si&s;ter, my Friend, the Si&s;ter of my be&s;t Friend, love him as he honours you; and me for his &s;ake, as I will you for your own, as well as his, to the end of my life</P>
<P>Sir Charles cla&s;ped his arms about us both. His
<PB N="196" REF="197">
eyes &s;poke his admiration of her, and his delight in each. Angels he called us. Then &s;eating us, he took the Count's hand; and, leading him to her, Let me, madam, pre&s;ent to you the Count of Belvedere, as a man equally to be pitied and e&s;teemed. He yields to your magnanimity with a greatne&s;s of mind like your own. Receive then, acknowlege, the <HI>friend</HI> in him. He will endeavour to forego a dearer hope.</P>
<P>Then will I receive him as my friend. I thank you, my Lord, for the honour you have &s;o long done me. May you be happy with a woman, who <HI>can</HI> de|&s;erve you!&mdash;See that happy pair before you! May you be <HI>as</HI> happy as Sir Charles Grandi&s;on!&mdash;What greater felicity can I wi&s;h you?</P>
<P>He took her hand: On one knee he lifted it to his lips: I will tear from you, madam, a tormentor. I mu&s;t a&s;k nothing of <HI>you;</HI> but, for my&s;elf, I can only promi&s;e, in the words of the Chevalier Grandi|&s;on, to <HI>endeavour</HI> to forego, a dearer, the <HI>deare&s;t,</HI> hope.</P>
<P>The Count aro&s;e, bowing to her with profound re&s;pect; his eyes full; as his heart &s;eemed to be. Signor Jeronymo motioned to return to the company. Lady Clementina wi&s;hed to retire with me, till what had pa&s;&s;ed was related to the re&s;t. I led her to my clo&s;et. There did we renew our vows of everla&s;ting friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, thinking the relation would be painful to the Count, withdrew with him into his Study. Mrs. Beaumont, and Signor Jeronymo, told tho&s;e who were not pre&s;ent at the affecting &s;cenes, what had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>When we were &s;ummoned to dinner, every one re|ceived Lady Clementina as an Angel. They ap|plauded her for her noble behaviour to the Count, and ble&s;&s;ed them&s;elves for having taken the re&s;olution of coming to England; and, mo&s;t of all, they ble&s;&s;ed my dear Sir Charles; to whom they a&s;cribed all their open|ing
<PB N="197" REF="198">
happy pro&s;pects; and promi&s;ed them&s;elves that his family and theirs would be as much one, as if the alli|ance, once &s;o near taking place, had actually done &s;o.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, at and after dinner, urged the carry|ing into execution the latter part of his beneficent plan. He offered to attend them to the Drawing|room, to the Play, to the Oratorios (and took that op|portunity to give the prai&s;es which every-body allows to be due to Mr. Handel); and to every place of Public Entertainment which was worthy the notice of Foreigners; and left it to their choice, whether they would go fir&s;t to Grandi&s;on-hall, or &s;atisfy their curio&s;ity in and about town.</P>
<P>The Marquis &s;aid, that as Sir Charles and I were brought out of the country by the arrival of their Clementina, and our expectation of them, he doubted not but it would be mo&s;t agreeable to us, to return to our own &s;eat; adding, politely, that the highe&s;t entertainment they could have, would be the com|pany and conver&s;ation of us, and our friends; and that rather at our own &s;eats, than any-where el&s;e. The public diver&s;ions, he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, might take their attention afterwards. Now they were here, they would not be in ha&s;te to return, provided Sir Charles and his friends would an&s;wer the hope he had given of accompanying them back to Italy.</P>
<P>There is no repeating the polite and agreeable things, that were &s;aid on all &s;ides.</P>
<P>Well then, my dear grandmamma, to cut &s;hort, thus it was at la&s;t agreed upon:</P>
<P>The Count of Belvedere, who, all the afternoon and evening, received the highe&s;t marks of civility and politene&s;s from the admirable Clementina (which, by the way, I am afraid will not promote his cure) pro|po&s;es, with Signors Seba&s;tiano and Juliano, to pa&s;s a month or &s;ix weeks in &s;eeing every-thing which they &s;hall think worthy of their notice in and about this great city; and then, after one farewel-vi&s;it to us,
<PB N="198" REF="199">
they intend to &s;et out together for the Court of Madrid; where the Count intends to &s;tay &s;ome months.</P>
<P>We &s;hall all &s;et out, on Monday next, for Grandi|&s;on-hall.</P>
<P>Lord and Lady L. will follow us in a week or fortnight.</P>
<P>How will the poor dear Charlotte mutter! whi&s;|pered Lady L. to me: But &s;he and her Lord will join us as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Mrs. Eleanor Grandi&s;on loves not the Hall, be|cau&s;e of the hard&s;hips &s;he received from the late owner of it, Sir Thomas; and thinks her&s;elf bound by a ra&s;h vow which &s;he made the la&s;t time &s;he was there, Never again to enter its gates: And &s;he will be delighted, Lady L. &s;ays, in attending, in the ab|&s;ence of the fathers and mothers, the dear little in|fants of her two nieces.</P>
<P>Lady Clementina whi&s;pered me more than once, how happy &s;he &s;hould think her&s;elf in the&s;e excur|&s;ions; and hoped all their healths would be e&s;tabli&s;h|ed by them. She &s;aid the &s;weete&s;t, the mo&s;t affec|tionate things to me. Once &s;he &s;aid, bidding me call her nothing but <HI>my</HI> Clementina, that &s;he &s;hould be happy, if &s;he were &s;ure I loved her as much as &s;he loved me. I a&s;&s;ured her, and that from my very heart, that I dearly loved her.</P>
<P>Surely it was a happy incident, my dear grand|mamma, that Lady Clementina took a &s;tep, which, tho' at fir&s;t it had a ra&s;h appearance, has been pro|ductive of &s;o much joy to all round (to the poor Count of Belvedere excepted) and, in particular, to</P>

<P>EVERY hour in the day &s;ome circum&s;tance or other makes me wi&s;h my dear Lady Grandi&s;on in Northampton&s;hire. Emily charms us all&mdash;But &s;till every object reminds us of our Harriet. Not that Harriet <HI>alone</HI> would content us now. Nor could Sir Charles and Lady Grandi&s;on be at this time &s;pared by their noble gue&s;t. After all therefore, every-thing
<PB N="200" REF="201">
is be&s;t as it is. But indeed we all wi&s;hed for you ye&s;ter|day evening, mo&s;t particularly, at Shirley-manor. The conver&s;ation was an intere&s;ting one to all us girls; and Emily, Nancy, and our cou&s;in Holles's, have brought me to give you an account of it, and to appeal to you upon it; and through you to Lady G. And yet we are all of us more than half afraid of a Lady, who has already treated but lightly, a &s;ubject that young women think of high importance.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation began with my cou&s;in Kitty's greatly pitying Lady Clementina; de&s;cribing in her pathetic way, the &s;truggles &s;he had had between her fir&s;t duties and her inclination; the noble preference &s;he had given to the former; and the per&s;ecution, as &s;he called it, of all her friends to induce her to marry when &s;he cho&s;e to live &s;ingle all her life. Every one of us young folks joined with my cou&s;in Kitty.</P>
<P>But your grandmamma Shirley could not, &s;he &s;aid, perfectly agree with us in the hard&s;hip of Lady Cle|mentina's &s;ituation; who having from noble motives &s;pontaneou&s;ly rejected the man of her choice, was, from rea&s;ons of family convenience, and even of per&s;onal happine&s;s, urged to marry a nobleman, who, by all accounts, is highly de&s;erving and agreeable, and every|way &s;uitable to her: A man in &s;hort, to whom &s;he pretended not an aver&s;ion; nor hoped nor wi&s;hed to be the wife of any other man; propo&s;ing to her&s;elf only the Single Life, and having given up all thoughts of taking the veil.</P>
<P><HI>Per&s;onal happine&s;s!</HI> cried out Mi&s;s Kitty Holles: Can the woman be happy in a &s;econd choice, who&s;e fir&s;t was Sir Charles Grandi&s;on?</P>
<P>And whom, for noble motives, &s;he refu&s;ed, &s;aid my aunt Selby, remember <HI>that,</HI> Kitty; and whom &s;he wi&s;hed to be, and who actually is, the hu&s;band of an|other woman.</P>
<P>The girls looked at one another: But Mrs. Shirley &s;peaking, they were all &s;ilent.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="202">
The happine&s;s of human Life, my dears, replied your grandmamma, is at be&s;t but comparative. The utmo&s;t we &s;hould hope for here, is &s;uch a &s;ituation, as, with a &s;elf-approving mind, will carry us be&s;t through this pre&s;ent &s;cene of trial: Such a &s;ituation, as, all circum&s;tances con&s;idered, is, upon the whole, mo&s;t eligible for us, tho' &s;ome of its circum&s;tances may be di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>Young people &s;et out with fal&s;e notions of hap|pine&s;s; gay, fairy-land imaginations; and when the&s;e &s;chemes prove unattainable, &s;it down in di&s;appoint|ment and dejection. Tell me now, Kitty Holles, and &s;peak freely, my Love [She would not addre&s;s her&s;elf to &s;ome of us for a rea&s;on I, your Lucy, for one, need not give] we are all friends; the grave&s;t of us <HI>have been</HI> young; tell us, Kitty, your ideas of happine&s;s for a young woman ju&s;t &s;etting out in Life.</P>
<P>Poor Emily an&s;wered only with a &s;udden blu&s;h, and a half-&s;tifled &s;igh: But all the re&s;t, as with one voice, cried out Harriet, our Harriet, is <HI>the</HI> happy woman&mdash;To be married to the man of her choice; The man cho&s;en by her friends, and applauded by all the world.</P>
<P>And &s;o, &s;aid Mrs. Selby, as there is but <HI>one</HI> Sir Charles Grandi&s;on in the world, were his &s;cheme of Prote&s;tant Nunneries put in execution, all the re&s;t of womankind, who had &s;een him with di&s;tinction, might retire into cloi&s;ters.</P>

<P>Be&s;ides, &s;aid I (my own ca&s;e in view) when our eye has led our choice, imagination can ea&s;ily add all good qualities to the plau&s;ible appearance. But to give our hand where we cannot give a preference, is &s;urely, madam, acting again&s;t con&s;cience in the mo&s;t important article of Life.</P>
<P>A <HI>preference</HI> we ought to give, my Lucy: But need this be the preference of giddy inclination? No

ver&s;ion pre-&s;uppo&s;ed, will not rea&s;on and duty give this preference in a &s;ecurer and nobler way to the man who, upon the whole, is mo&s;t &s;uitable to us? It is well known, that I was always for di&s;couraging our Harriet's declarations, that &s;he never would be the wife of any other man than him &s;he is now &s;o happy as to call hers. If (as we all at one time apprehend|ed) our hopes had been ab&s;olutely impracticable, the noble Counte&s;s of D. who gave &s;uch convincing rea|&s;ons on her &s;ide of the que&s;tion <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. V. Letter xviii.</NOTE>would have had my good wi&s;hes for the Earl of D. So, before him, had not ill health been an objection, would Mr. Orme. You all know, that I wi&s;hed but to live to &s;ee my Harriet the wife of &s;ome worthy man. A &s;ingle woman is too generally an undefended, un&s;upported creature. Her early connexions, year by year, drop off; no new ones ari&s;e; and &s;he remains &s;olitary and unheeded, in a bu&s;y bu&s;tling world; perhaps &s;oured to it by her unconnected &s;tate. Is not &s;ome gra|titude due to a worthy man, who early offers him&s;elf for her guide and protector through Life? Gratitude was the motive even of Harriet's inclination at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Nancy &s;miled. Why &s;miles my Nancy? a&s;ked your &s;miling grandmamma. I am &s;ure you think, child&punc; there is weight in what I &s;aid.</P>
<P>Indeed, madam, there is&mdash;Great weight&mdash;But ju&s;t as you gave us an idea of the dreary unconnected Life of a &s;ingle woman in years, I thought of poor Mrs. Penelope Arby. You all know her. I &s;aw her in imagination, &s;urrounded with parrots and lap-dogs!&mdash;So &s;pring-like at pa&s;t fifty, with her pale pink Lute|&s;tring, and back head&mdash;Yet &s;o peevi&s;h at girls!&mdash;</P>
<P>And &s;he, re&s;umed Mrs. Shirley, refu&s;ed &s;ome good offers in her youth, out of dread of the tyranny of a hu&s;band, and the trouble&s;omene&s;s of a parcel of Brats!&mdash;Yet now &s;he is ab&s;olutely governed by a fa|vourite maid, and as full of the Bon-mots of her par|rots,
<PB N="203" REF="204">
as I u&s;ed to be of yours, my Loves, when you were prattlers.</P>
<P>Yet let us not, &s;aid Mrs. Selby, with the in&s;olence of Matrons or Brides-expectant, be too &s;evere upon Old Maids. Lady G&punc; &s;urely is faulty in this particu|lar. Many worthy and many happy per&s;ons in that cla&s;s, have I known: Many amiable and u&s;eful in &s;o|ciety, even to their late&s;t age&mdash;You, madam, to Mrs. Shirley, <HI>had</HI> a friend&mdash;Mrs. Eggleton.</P>
<P>I had, my dear Mrs. Selby&mdash;Never has any length of time, any variety of &s;cene, at all effaced the dear idea, tho' &s;he died many years ago. She never mar|ried; but that was not her own fault. She was ad|dre&s;&s;ed when near twenty, by a young gentleman of unexceptionable character. She received his addre&s;&s;es, on condition that both their friends approved of them. She was a vi&s;iter in town. The relations of both lived in the country. The young couple loved each other: But neither of their families, when con&s;ulted, approving the match, to the great regret of both, it was broken off. The gentleman married, and was not unhappy. In three or four years, another wor|thy man made his addre&s;&s;es to Mrs. Eggleton. All her friends approved. She found him de&s;erving of her affection, and agreed to reward his merit. He was to make one voyage to the Indies, on pro&s;pects too great to be neglected, and on his return they were to be married. His voyage was pro&s;perous to the ex|tent of all his wi&s;hes. He landed in his native coun|try; flew to his beloved mi&s;tre&s;s. She received his vi&s;it with grateful joy. It was his <HI>la&s;t</HI> vi&s;it. He was taken ill of a violent fever; died in a few days, deli|rious, but ble&s;&s;ing her.</P>
<P>She and I have talked over the &s;ubject we are upon a hundred times. In tho&s;e days I was young, and had my romantic notions.</P>
<P><HI>Indeed,</HI> madam! &s;aid Patty Holles; <HI>Indeed,</HI> ma|dam! &s;aid Emily&mdash;Dear, dear madam, &s;aid Kitty
<PB N="204" REF="205">
Holles, if it be not too bold a reque&s;t, let us hear what they were.</P>
<P>The reading in fa&s;hion when I was young, was Ro|mances. You, my children, have, in that re&s;pect, fallen into happier days. The pre&s;ent age is greatly obliged to the authors of the Spectators. But till I be|came acquainted with my dear Mrs. Eggleton, which was about my &s;ixteenth year, I was over-run with the ab&s;urdities of that unnatural kind of writing.</P>
<P>And how long, madam, did they hold?</P>
<P>Not till I was quite twenty. That good Lady cured me of &s;o fal&s;e a ta&s;te: But till &s;he did, I had very high ideas of fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions; of eternal con|&s;tancy; of Love rai&s;ed to a pitch of idolatry. In the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions, not more than nineteen, was my dear Mr. Shirley propo&s;ed to me, as a per&s;on who&s;e character was faultle&s;s; his offers advantageous. I had &s;een him in company two or three times, and looked upon him merely as a good &s;ort of man; a &s;en&s;ible man&mdash;But what was a good &s;ort of man to an Oroondates? He had paid no addre&s;&s;es to <HI>me:</HI> He applied to my friends on a foot of propriety and pru|dence. They laid no con&s;traint upon me. I con|&s;ulted my own heart&mdash;But, my dear girls, what a temptation have you thrown in the way of narrative old age!</P>
<P>All of us mo&s;t eagerly be&s;ought her to go on.</P>
<P>The excellent Mrs. Eggleton knew my heart bet|ter than I did my&s;elf. Even <HI>now,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, you <HI>di&s;|like</HI> not this worthy man. You can make no rea&s;on|able objection to his offer. You are one of many Si&s;ters [We were then a numerous family&mdash;Alas! how many dear friends have I out lived!] A match &s;o advantageous for you, will be of real benefit to your whole family. E&s;teem, heightened by Gratitude, and enforced by Duty, continued &s;he, will &s;oon ripen into Love: The only &s;ort of Love that &s;uits this im|perfect &s;tate; a <HI>tender,</HI> a <HI>faithful</HI> affection. There
<PB N="205" REF="206">
<HI>is</HI> a &s;uperior ardor due only to Supreme perfection and only to be exerci&s;ed by us mortal creatures in humble devotion. My dear Henrietta, concluded &s;he, <HI>conde&s;cend</HI> to be happy in &s;uch a way as &s;uits this mor|tal &s;tate.</P>
<P>I replied to her, with di&s;tre&s;s of mind, proceeded Mrs. Shirley, that I could not depend upon my own &s;entiments. I had &s;een little of the world. Suppo&s;e, after I have vowed Love to a man quite indifferent to me, I &s;hould meet with the very one, the kindred &s;oul, who mu&s;t irre&s;i&s;tably claim my whole heart? I will not &s;u&s;pect my&s;elf of any po&s;&s;ibility of mi&s;con|duct, where the duty and the crime would be &s;o glaring; but mu&s;t I not, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, be for ever mi&s;erable?</P>
<P>The mild Mrs. Eggleton did not chide: She only argued with me. Often afterwards did I with delight, repeat this conver&s;ation to the be&s;t of men, my dear Mr. Shirley, when a length of happy years had veri|fied all &s;he &s;aid.</P>
<P>Dear madam, cried Kitty, tell us how &s;he argued, or we &s;hall all remain on your &s;ide of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>O my children! &s;aid the venerable parent, in what talkativene&s;s do you engage me!</P>
<P>I fear, Henrietta, &s;aid Mrs. Eggleton, that tho' you are a good chri&s;tian, your opinions in this point are a little heatheni&s;h. You look upon Love as a blind irre&s;i&s;table Deity, who&s;e darts fly at random, and admit neither defence nor cure. Con&s;ider the matter, my dear, in a more rea&s;onable light. The pa&s;&s;ions are intended for our &s;ervants, not our ma&s;ters, and we have, within us, a power of controuling them, which it is the duty and the bu&s;ine&s;s of our lives to exert. You will allow this readily in the ca&s;e of any pa&s;&s;ion that poets and romance writers have not &s;et off with their fal&s;e colourings. To in&s;tance in <HI>anger;</HI> Will my Henrietta own, that &s;he thinks it probable, anger &s;hould ever tran&s;port her beyond the bounds of duty?</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="207">
I pleaded, that I was not naturally of an angry temper; and was a&s;ked with a &s;mile, whether I meant by that di&s;tinction, to own my&s;elf of a <HI>loving</HI> one.</P>
<P>I could not be angry with my good Mrs. Eggle|ton; yet I remember I was vexed to the heart.</P>
<P>But why then, rejoined &s;he, &s;hould you think your|&s;elf more likely to fall in Love <HI>after</HI> you are married, than <HI>before?</HI></P>
<P>At lea&s;t, &s;aid I, a little peevi&s;hly, let me &s;tay till I <HI>am</HI> in Love, as you are plea&s;ed to call it, before I marry.</P>
<P>I would not by any means, replied &s;he, have you marry a man for whom you have not a preferable inclination; but why may you not find, on admit|ting Mr. Shirley's addre&s;&s;es, young, agreeable, wor|thy, and every way &s;uitable to you, as <HI>he</HI> is, that he is that man whom your inclination can approve?</P>
<P>I never &s;aw him yet, &s;aid I, with the lea&s;t emo|tion. I have no aver&s;ion to him: I might e&s;teem him: But what is that to the Love one is &s;o &s;olemn|ly to vow a hu&s;band? And &s;hould I, after that vow, behold an object whom I could indeed have loved?&mdash;</P>
<P>A Duke de Nemours! &s;aid &s;he, taking up the <HI>Prince&s;s of Cleves,</HI> that unluckily lay on my table&mdash;Ah, my Henrietta, have I found you out!&mdash;That prince&s;s, my dear, was a &s;illy woman. Her &s;tory is written with dangerous elegance; but the whole foundation of her di&s;tre&s;&s;es was an idle one. To fan|&s;y her&s;elf in Love with a mere &s;tranger, becau&s;e he appeared agreeable at a Ball, when &s;he lived happily with a worthy hu&s;band, was mi&s;taking mere <HI>Liking</HI> for Love, and combating all her Life after with a chimera of her own creating. I do not tell you it is impo&s;&s;ible for you to meet hereafter with per&s;ons in &s;ome external accompli&s;hments &s;uperior to the de&s;erv|ing man who&s;e wi&s;h is to make you happy: But will you &s;uffer your eye to lead you into mi&s;ery <HI>then,</HI> when
<PB N="207" REF="208">
an additional tie of duty forbids its wandering? If &s;o, I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e it would equally mi&s;lead you <HI>now.</HI> Tell me, Henrietta, What think you of tho&s;e girls, who bla&s;t all the hopes of their fond parents, by e|loping with a well-dre&s;t captain, a &s;pruce dancing|ma&s;ter, or a hand&s;ome player?</P>
<P>She &s;truck me dumb with &s;hame.</P>
<P>You &s;ee then, my dear, the filial duty, the duty of a rea&s;onable and mode&s;t woman, were &s;he even without parents or friends, forbids fancy to be her guide, as much as the &s;acred engagement of marriage forbids it to be her tormenter.</P>
<P>But have there not been in&s;tances, &s;aid I; do not you and I know one [We did] in this neighbour|hood, where a truly good woman was made mi&s;erable for years, by having her heart and hand differently engaged?</P>
<P>Mrs. Eggleton reminded me, that there were, in that ca&s;e, &s;uch extremely particular circum&s;tances, as made it ab&s;urd to form from thence a general judg|ment. In almo&s;t every thing, &s;aid &s;he, we act but upon probabilities; and one exception out of a thou|&s;and ought never to determine us. Even this excep|tion in the ca&s;e you hint at, is owing, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, to a pitiable mi&s;guided imagination. Let us take our rules, my dear, from plain common &s;en&s;e, and not from poetical refinements.</P>
<P>Say, my children, &s;aid the conde&s;cending parent, did my friend argue well?</P>
<P>I think, madam, an&s;wered Kitty, &s;he argued poor Love out of doors. She did not &s;eem to allow the po&s;&s;ibility of any per&s;on's being in Love at all.</P>
<P>I told her &s;o, replied my grandmamma.</P>
<P>So far from it, &s;aid &s;he, with a &s;igh, and a look expre&s;&s;ive of the &s;ofte&s;t tenderne&s;s, that my own af|fections, as you know, were deeply engaged. The amiable youth, to whom I was to be united by mar|riage, died. His memory will ever be dear to my
<PB N="208" REF="209">
heart. Love authorized by rea&s;onable pro&s;pects; Love guided and heightened by duty, is every-thing excellent that poets have &s;aid of it: Yet even <HI>this</HI> Love mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the awful di&s;pen&s;ations of Pro|vidence, whether of death or other di&s;appointment; and &s;uch trials ought to be met with chearful re&s;igna|tion, and not to be the means of embittering our lives, or of rendering them u&s;ele&s;s: And every thing we ought to do, be a&s;&s;ured, my dear, we &s;hall be enabled to do, if we &s;et about it rightly, and with equal humility and tru&s;t. As for that kind of Love, which in its very beginning is contrary to Duty, to &s;uppo&s;e <HI>that</HI> unconquerable, is making our&s;elves wretched indeed: And for fir&s;t-&s;ight impre&s;&s;ions, and <HI>beginning</HI> inclinations, though always dangerous, and often guilty to indulge, they are ab&s;olutely trifles to overcome and &s;uppre&s;s, to a per&s;on of prudence and virtue.</P>
<P>How we dwelt upon every &s;weet document that fell from the lips of the dear Mrs. Shirley!</P>
<P>But now, Harriet, for the appeals. After all, were you, or were you <HI>not,</HI> a romantic girl, when you de|clared, that you never would be the wife of any man living, if you were not Sir Charles Gaandi&s;on's; even at the time when neither you nor we thought there could be any hopes of &s;uch a happy event?&mdash;</P>
<P>But had we not, however, better appeal to Lady G. than to you? You were always <HI>&s;o</HI> wi&s;e!&mdash;Yet you could not be contented with the worthy Orme. You knew, in&s;tinctively, as I may &s;ay, that your kindred mind dwelt in St. James's Square. And Lady G. forty years hence will be looking back, I &s;uppo&s;e, with wonder, on the time when &s;he gave her then fair hand of &s;wan-&s;kin, changed to buff. [Her own &s;lighty idea!] with reluctance, to her de&s;erving Lord. So, perhaps, we had be&s;t make no appeals at all. If we did, neither you nor &s;he are at lei&s;ure now to an&s;wer them. Yet we have one appeal more to make; but

it mu&s;t be to our Harriet; not to Lady G.&mdash;Was not even our venerable parent a little too &s;evere upon Old Maids?

the poor Lord G.; who made the hone&s;t man, whenever I plea&s;ed, foam, fume, fret, and exe|crate the hour that he fir&s;t beheld my face, now &s;tand forth, an example of true conjugal felicity, and an encouragement for girls who venture into the married &s;tate, without that prodigious quantity of violent pa&s;&s;ion, which &s;ome hare-brained creatures think as e&s;&s;ential of Love.</P>
<P>You, my dear, left us <HI>tolerably</HI> happy. But now we are almo&s;t <HI>in</HI>-tolerably &s;o. I had begun to recover my &s;pirits, depre&s;&s;ed, as they had been, for near a month before, on finding my&s;elf, like any common woman, confined to my chamber, while every other mouth &s;ang O be joyful; and one was preparing, another was &s;et out, and half a &s;core more were actu|ally got to dear Grandi&s;on-hall.

<P>The nur&s;e, the nur&s;ery-maids, knowing that I would not for the world have been &s;o caught by my nimble Lord (for he is in twenty places in a minute) were more affrighted than Diana's nymphs, when the godde&s;s was &s;urpri&s;ed by Acteon; and each, in&s;tead of &s;urrounding me in order to hide my blu&s;hes, was for running a different way; not &s;o much as attempt|ing to relieve me from the Brat.</P>

But, that I may &s;eem only to have changed the <HI>ob|ject,</HI> not wholly to have parted with my levity, read the inclo&s;ed here, in an&s;wer to the appeal of the young people; directed thus:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>Lady <HI>G.</HI> To Mi&s;s <HI>LUCY SELBY,</HI> And the re&s;t of the Girls at Selby-hou&s;e,</HEAD>
<OPENER>Greeting.</OPENER>
<P>YOU appeal to Harriet, and revoke your appeal: You appeal to me, and withdraw it in the &s;ame Letter&mdash;a parcel of chits! You know not what you would have; what you would be; and hardly what you are: You can have the &s;aucine&s;s in more places than one, to reflect upon me your judge. But are you not convinced by the &s;olid arguments of Mrs. Shir|ley? and her Mrs. Eggleton? If you are not, what &s;trange creatures are girls from &s;ixteen to twenty-two! Don't boys read romances as well as girls? Yet, in the&s;e latter days, do the glaring ab&s;urdities influence them &s;o much in Love-matters, or la&s;t &s;o long? Fooli&s;h things! would you give a preference again&s;t your&s;elves to the other Sex?</P>
<P>Harriet, <HI>I</HI> think, was a <HI>romantic</HI> girl, when &s;he made her declarations of <HI>one</HI> man only, or no one, for a hu&s;band. I did let her know my mind at the time by hints: But had my brother actually married Clementina; not only I, but her grandmother Shirley, and aunt Selby, and uncle too (odd &s;oul as he is in &s;ome things) would have &s;poken out, in favour of the young Earl of D. And had it not been with &s;ucce&s;s, after a proper time had pa&s;&s;ed, I, for my part, would have &s;et her down as a very &s;illy girl; inferior, in this re&s;pect, to you, Lucy, and to twenty more I could name: For how few of us are there, who have their fir&s;t Loves? And indeed how few fir&s;t Loves are fit to be encouraged? You know my thoughts, Lucy,
<PB N="214" REF="215">
of a beginning Love, in a young bo&s;om <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Vol. VI. p. 162, 163.</NOTE>&mdash;A very, very &s;illy and childi&s;h affair, believe me.</P>
<P>Let me enumerate a few chances that may render a fir&s;t Love impracticable.</P>
<P>A young woman may fix her affections on a man, who may prove per&s;idious&mdash;On a man, who may be engaged to another woman; as had like to have been my brother's ca&s;e&mdash;On a man who may be &s;uperior to her in degree or fortune; or who may be greatly inferior to her in both.&mdash;If Love be not a voluntary pa&s;&s;ion, why not upon an ho&s;tler, a groom, a coach|man, a footman&mdash;A grenadier, a trooper, a foot|&s;oldier?&mdash;She may be in Mrs. Eggleton's ca&s;e: Her Lover may be taken from her by death. In either, or any, of the&s;e ca&s;es, what is to be done? Mu&s;t a woman &s;it down, cry her&s;elf blind, and become u&s;e|le&s;s to the principal end of her being, as to this life, and to all family connexions, when, probably, &s;he has not lived one third of her time?&mdash;Silly creatures!&mdash;to maintain the&s;e non&s;en&s;es at their own expence, in fa|vour of a pa&s;&s;ion that is generally confined to the days of girlhood; and which they them&s;elves would laugh at in a woman after &s;he was arrived at hone&s;t thirty, or at years of di&s;cretion&mdash;Thus narrowing their own u&s;e and con&s;equence.&mdash;I, for my part, am, and ever will be, a friend of my Sex.</P>
<P>But hark ye, girls&mdash;Let me a&s;k you&mdash;Do you find many of the&s;e <HI>con&s;tant</HI> nymphs, when they have had their fooli&s;h way given them, and they have <HI>buried</HI> the hone&s;t man of whom they were once &s;o dotingly fond, refu&s;e to marry again?&mdash;Do they wi&s;h, like the wives of &s;ome Pagan wretches, to be thrown into the funeral pile, with the dead bodies of their Lords?&mdash;No! They have had their <HI>whim&s;ey</HI> out. Their <HI>Fit of con&s;tancy</HI> is over; and, quiet good &s;ouls as they are by that time become, they go on without <HI>Rantipoling,</HI> in the ordinary cour&s;e of rea&s;onable creatures.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="216">
Not but Harriet was in earne&s;t: I am &s;ure &s;he was. She believed, &s;he <HI>certainly</HI> believed, HERSELF. And were it given to us women <HI>always</HI> to be in <HI>one</HI> mind, &s;he would have made all her friends, the good Mrs. Shirley at the head of us, de&s;pair of &s;ucceeding with her in our endeavours to induce her to change it. But Harriet, with all her wi&s;dom, could not know what <HI>Time</HI> would have done for her. Time is the pa|cifier of every woe, the qualifier of every di&s;appoint|ment&mdash;Pity for the man [the Earl of D. &s;uppo&s;e&mdash;He would have thought it worth his while to feign dying for her]; the Entreaty of her friends:-You &s;ee what arguments her excellent grandmamma could have produced&mdash;Pho, pho, never fear but Harriet would have married before my Brother and Clementina had &s;een the face of their &s;econd boy&mdash;No <HI>girls</HI> &s;hall he have, for fear they &s;hould be Romancers.</P>
<P>And, do you think, that Clementina and the Count of Belvedere, a year or two hence&mdash;I have no fear of the matter; if they do not teaze, torment, oppo&s;e her. If they <HI>do</HI>&mdash;Why then, I will not be an&s;wer|able for their &s;ucce&s;s. For, with excellences that none but &s;he and Harriet among women ever boa&s;ted, there is a glorious perver&s;ene&s;s, which they mi&s;call <HI>con&s;tancy</HI> and <HI>per&s;everance,</HI> in the mind of that noble Lady (and indeed in the minds of <HI>mo&s;t</HI> of us) that will probably, as it has already done, carry her thro' all oppo&s;ition&mdash;In &s;hort, no more teazing, torment|ing from Friends, no more heroics from Girls&mdash;Is not oppo&s;ition, is not re&s;i&s;tance, the very &s;oul and e&s;&s;ence of all &s;orts of heroi&s;m?&mdash;My life therefore for Cle|mentina's, admirable creature as &s;he undoubtedly is&mdash;Leave her &s;ea-room, leave her land-room, and let her have time to con&s;ider; and &s;he will be a Bride.</P>
<P>Did I ever mention to you a trick that an hone&s;t guardian put upon his ward? Many a one have you heard of from <HI>di&s;hone&s;t</HI> ones. This briefly was it.</P>
<P>The girl was of the heroic &s;tamp; as good a girl
<PB N="216" REF="217">
as an heroic girl could well be. A match was propo&s;ed for her, much more con&s;iderable than &s;he could have expected, as to fortune; and as to the man's per&s;on and qualities of mind, ab&s;olutely unexceptionable&mdash;Young, hand&s;ome, gallant, and mo&s;t ardently in Love with her: But, unpolitic! he had let her know as much, before he had made him&s;elf &s;ure of the &s;ha|dow of a return, or acceptance. Her guardian, from pure Love of his ward, and a &s;en&s;e of the advantage|ou&s;ne&s;s of the offer, heartily e&s;pou&s;ed the intere&s;ts of the young gentleman. This was <HI>another</HI> unhappine&s;s to him. She gave him an ab&s;olute denial: Nor vouch&s;afed &s;he to a&s;&s;ign a rea&s;on for it; having, in|deed, no other man either in her head or heart.</P>
<P>Her guardian was a man who knew the world, and a little of her Sex: He &s;aw that Mi&s;s was in the very meridian of her heroics; and that the grievance mo&s;t probably was, that there was no likelihood of difficulty or oppo&s;ition. He took another cour&s;e. He acquainted the young Lady, that he had altered his mind: That he had objections to the addre&s;s of Sir Arthur Poinings (the young gentleman's name) and declared, that he never would give his con&s;ent. He de&s;ired that &s;he would by no means &s;ee him, or re|ceive Letters from him; and he talked of carrying her down to his country-&s;eat in a full town-&s;ea&s;on; [The girl had a ta&s;te for plea&s;ure&mdash;What girl has not?] not doubting, he &s;aid, that the young Baronet would per&s;ecute her with his addre&s;&s;es while &s;he re|mained in London. He then actually forbid Sir Ar|thur his hou&s;e; and, more than once, read Mi&s;s a Lec|ture on the <HI>Authority</HI> of a <HI>guardian,</HI> and the <HI>Duty</HI> of a <HI>ward.</HI> Words that naturally incite young girls to rebellion.</P>
<P>Sir Arthur &s;ound means to write to the minx, as if unknown to her guardian. Darts, flames, and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, were &s;ugge&s;ted in his Letter. The girl be|gan to relent; the guardian to &s;u&s;pect: He <HI>renewed</HI>
<PB N="217" REF="218">
his prohibition; cunning creature! The affair now wore a face of difficulty. She an&s;wered the young gentleman's Letters. It became a regular Love|affair of the heroic kind. And, at la&s;t&mdash;What at la&s;t!&mdash;Why, the young Lady, attended only by her faithful DELIA, who had been a&s;&s;i&s;tant to the Lovers in their corre&s;pondence, ran away from an <HI>inexorable</HI> guardian, to Sir Arthur; married him; and, in a few days, writing an humble Letter for her cloaths, ac|knowleged ra&s;hne&s;s, which &s;he laid at the door of Love, and &s;o-forth. The guardian de&s;ired a meet|ing with the Love-yers; now no more <HI>Love-yers,</HI> but <HI>man</HI> and <HI>wife.</HI> They met, with trembling on her &s;ide, with pretended apprehen&s;ion on Sir Arthur's, for having di&s;obliged &s;o good a guardian. The guardian was in high good-humour. He forgave them both, at the fir&s;t word, and &s;urrendered up his tru&s;t with plea&s;ure. The girl was &s;urprized at his unexpected goodne&s;s; and had &s;he not been actually nailed down by the Solemnity, would very probably have again re&s;umed her heroics.</P>
<P>Well, but I am charmed with Mrs. Shirley's Eg|gleton, as well as with her account of her&s;elf in her heroic days. Little did I think that &s;he ever was <HI>girl</HI> enough to be infected: But, as &s;he &s;ays, ro|mances were the fa&s;hionable reading of her youthful years.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Tell aunt Selby that I am not an enemy to old maids; but only to tho&s;e ill qualities which I &s;hould equally di&s;like in old or in young <HI>Any-bodies.</HI> I love Lady Gertrude, and even aunt Eleanor, for tho&s;e qua|lities that are <HI>love-able</HI> in them. But you &s;ee that your Nancy, the mild, good-natured Nancy, could not for|bear laughing at the idea of the young-old Penelope Arby: Yet knows &s;he not, &s;ays the malicious Lucy, what may be her own ca&s;e. But I have appealed for you; and to whom? To Lady Gertrude. I was writing to her on a particular occa&s;ion, when your
<PB N="218" REF="219">
pacquet was brought me; and, in order to enliven my &s;ubject, tran&s;cribed three lines of Lucy's query upon defending the &s;ingle &s;tate. She was but at En|field, and returned me the following by the &s;ame me&s;&s;enger; the other part of my Letter requiring an immediate an&s;wer.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Your que&s;tion, my deare&s;t niece, is whim&s;ically a&s;ked: You tell me that a whole room-full of young country ladies wait only the &s;ucce&s;s of an appeal you have referred to me, to know whether they &s;hall out of hand di&s;po&s;e of them&s;elves to re|cruiting officers, mountebanks, and fox-hunters; or venture to live on with the melancholy title of old maids, in an un&s;upported, unde&s;ended &s;tate.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"One or two queries to be put, proceeds the Sage are, Whether the worthy matches you have men|tioned, or any un&s;uitable matches what&s;oever, would be a <HI>&s;upport</HI> and <HI>defence?</HI> Whether the wo|man who makes a ra&s;h and improper choice, does not throw her&s;elf out of that protection and de|fence which every one may depend upon in the &s;tate of life marked out to them by Providence? And whether the &s;ingle &s;tate is not thus marked out to the woman who never has it <HI>fitly</HI> in her choice to change it?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I, my dear, who am an old maid, mu&s;t not write partially on that &s;ide of the que&s;tion. In general, I will fairly own, that I think a woman is mo&s;t likely to find her proper happine&s;s in the married &s;tate. May you, my dear niece, experience it every day more and more!&mdash;But there are &s;urely many exceptions: Women of large and independent fortunes, who have the hearts and under&s;tanding to u&s;e them as they ought, are often more bene|ficial to the world, than they would have been had they be&s;towed them on &s;uch men as look for for|tune <HI>only.</HI> Women who have by their numerous relations many connexions in the world, need not

<P>But, girls, I will give you no more of Lady Ger|trude. I have not done with you my&s;elf yet.</P>
<P>Much to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, I remember, as Mrs. Shirley's, were the expo&s;tulations of Lady D. in one of her Letters to Harriet; who only an&s;wered her, (I al&s;o remember) like a girl. What <HI>could</HI> &s;he &s;ay?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You, my Harriet," (wrote that Lady,) "are pious, dutiful, benevolent&mdash;Cannot you, if you are unable to entertain, for the man who now with &s;o much ardour addre&s;&s;es you, were you married to him, the pa&s;&s;ion called <HI>Love,</HI> regard him as <HI>Grati|tude</HI> would oblige you to prefer any <HI>other</HI> man who is a&s;&s;iduous to do you &s;ervice or plea&s;ure?

<P>You have now before you, girls, the opinion of Mrs. Shirley, and the Counte&s;s of D. on the ea&s;e you put.

<P>AND mu&s;t I, my dear grandmamma, be <HI>more</HI> particular in relation to our&s;elves, our gue&s;ts, our amu&s;ements, diver&s;ions, conver&s;ations&mdash;Why then does not Lucy write as u&s;ual, every tender, every engaging, every lively occurrence that happens at Selby-hou&s;e, and Shirely-manor? Is &s;he &s;o much taken up with her <HI>agreeable</HI> Peer, that &s;he mu&s;t leave the obliging ta&s;k wholly to Nancy and Emily? I don't care. <HI>They</HI> &s;hall be my be&s;t girls; and I will put down my Lucy as a woman of mere quality before &s;he has the title. Yet let me tell her, that could ho|ne&s;t Mr. Fowler have courted for <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> have &s;uf|fered
<PB N="221" REF="222">
his heart to ri&s;e to his lips, I &s;hould have wi&s;hed by her means, to have been related to him and Sir Rowland. But that matter, it &s;eems, is as good as over; and I will proceed to do <HI>my</HI> duty, whether &s;he does <HI>hers</HI> or not.</P>
<P>I have told you, madam, how much our gue&s;ts are plea&s;ed with us and the place. How much we are charmed with <HI>them,</HI> I need not tell you. Every prai&s;e you have heard of them, is confirmed and heighten|ed, on a more intimate knowlege of them.</P>
<P>Lord and Lady L. are with us. Lord and Lady G. will come as &s;oon as they can. Lady L. has her &s;weet infant with her. And I hope Lady G. will not come without my god-child.</P>
<P>Sir Edward Beauchamp is at pre&s;ent our gue&s;t. The good doctor, you know, is at home here; and how beloved, how revered, by every one!</P>
<P>Sir Charles! The Soul of us all!&mdash;O madam! never &s;urely, was one &s;pot ble&s;&s;ed with &s;o many per|&s;ons of one mind, as are now rejoicing together at Grandi&s;on-hall.</P>
<P>And pray, my dear grandmamma, let me a&s;k; Would it not be affectation rather than mode&s;ty, were I to leave my&s;elf un-named in this noble circle? I will <HI>not.</HI> Every body, for Sir Charles's &s;ake, looks on me, with the kinde&s;t partiality, and my heart tells me that being his as much as my own, it de&s;erves that partiality.</P>
<P>Except at certain devotional hours of retirement, we know not, but that we are all of one faith. No|thing of religious &s;ubjects is ever mentioned among us, but in tho&s;e points in which all good Chri&s;tians are agreed. You, madam, who have a true catholic cha|rity for the worthy of all per&s;ua&s;ions, would be de|lighted to &s;ee the affectionate behaviour of the <HI>two</HI> fathers (I will call them) to each other. When they are not in the general company, they are always to|gether, walking, riding out; or in the apartment of
<PB N="222" REF="223">
each other, reading, conver&s;ing. The dear Clemen|tina cannot but &s;ee, that charitable and great minds, however differing in &s;ome even e&s;&s;ential articles of religion, might mingle hearts and love each other; and from Sir Charles's catholici&s;m, that &s;he might have been happy with him, and kept her own faith.&mdash;But no! it would in her notion, now I recollect, have been a dangerous trial. She could not tru&s;t <HI>her own</HI> heart&mdash;Great and noble Lady! how much is &s;he to be revered!</P>
<P>The gentlemen ride out almo&s;t every day.&mdash;Our conver&s;ations! It would be endle&s;s to give you an ac|count of the conver&s;ations that yet, I flatter my&s;elf, would delight you all. The lea&s;t intere&s;ting ones of tho&s;e we hold, would have made a great figure in my former Letters. Such the company, you may &s;up|po&s;e we know not what trifling &s;ubjects are.</P>
<P>Every one avoids mentioning the name of the poor Count of Belvedere in the pre&s;ence of Lady Cle|mentina; yet we all pity him. We have rea&s;on to do &s;o, from the account Signor Jeronymo receives of his di&s;tre&s;s of mind, while he endeavours to overcome his hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Allow me, madam, to conclude this Letter here. We are to have a little concert this evening, and our company is beginning to a&s;&s;emble in the mu&s;ic-room.&mdash;I mu&s;t go and attend the marchione&s;s and Lady Clementina; who her&s;elf will be a performer.

I, for my part, ought to be the la&s;t who &s;hould decide for her; I, who never, I think (&s;ay Lady G. what &s;he plea&s;es of my romancings) could have been happy with any man in the world but Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, after I had known him, and once was led to hope for &s;o great a ble&s;&s;ing and who have not that notion that &s;he has, or &s;eems to have, of the drearine&s;s, and di&s;advantages of a &s;ingle &s;tate; on the contrary, who think the married life attended with &s;o many cares and troubles, that it is rather (as it is a duty to enter into it, when it can be done with pru|dence) a kind of faulty <HI>indulgence</HI> and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, in or|der to avoid the&s;e cares and troubles, to live &s;ingle. But to leave this &s;ubject to the deci&s;ion of Lady G. and Lady Gertrude, the latter of whom has given &s;ome unan&s;werable hints on her Side of the Que&s;tion, I will proceed with my narrative.</P>
<P>And here let me ob&s;erve, that had not Lady Cle|mentina made her rejection of the be&s;t of men her &s;ole and deliberate Act, it is my humble opinion that her lo&s;s of him would have been in&s;upportable to <HI>her.</HI> That con&s;ideration, and her noble motive for it, ena|ble

her to behave gloriou&s;ly under the &s;elf-deprivation, as I may call it. Yet, I can &s;ee, at times, by her &s;tudiou&s;ly avoiding his company, and frequently ex|cu&s;ing her&s;elf from making one in little parties of Sir Charles's propo&s;ing; and by her chu&s;ing at all times, <HI>my</HI> company, that the noble Lady thinks &s;elf-denial <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> to her peace.</P>
<P>She was once for putting Jeronymo on propo&s;ing to leave England &s;ooner than they had intended; and take my promi&s;e to <HI>follow</HI> them. I was pre&s;ent. She had tears in her eyes when &s;he propo&s;ed it. We had been talking of Sir Charles in raptures, on &s;ome of his noble charities which had but lately come to our knowlege, and it was pretty evident to me, that &s;he, at the time, was of opinion, that di&s;tance from him would be a means to quiet her heart&mdash;The dear Emily finds it &s;o, thank God!</P>
<P>Lady Clementina has been, however, tolerably chearful &s;ince, amu&s;ing her&s;elf with drawing up plans for her future life. Very pretty ones &s;ome of them: But a little too <HI>ideal,</HI> if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf; and &s;he changes them too often to &s;hew that &s;teadine&s;s, which I want to &s;ee in her mind. Poor Lady! How I pity her as I contemplate her, in her contrivances and propo&s;als! I am often forced to turn away my face, that &s;he may not &s;ee the &s;tarting Tear.</P>

<P>THE Count of Belvedere being returned to Lon|don from a country excur&s;ion, and not very well, the Marqui&s;s was de&s;irous of making a vi&s;it to him, and at the &s;ame time to pa&s;s a few Days in London to &s;ee the Curio&s;ities of the place, and to be pre&s;ent at &s;ome of the publick entertainments. The gentlemen at the fir&s;t Motion made a party to attend him, and Sir Charles, you may &s;uppo&s;e, would not, in complai&s;ance, be excu&s;ed.

<P>MRS. Beaumont has received a Letter from the La|dies her friends at Florence, expre&s;&s;ing their fear that the love of her Country now &s;he is in it, has taken place in her heart, and weakened her Affection for them. They beg of her to convince them of the con|trary by ha&s;tening to them.</P>
<P>This Letter, it &s;eems, mentions &s;ome &s;evere reflex|ions ca&s;t upon Lady Clementina by the unhappy Olivia. Camilla, who is very fond of me, has hinted this to me, and at the &s;ame time acquainted me with her young Lady's earne&s;tne&s;s to &s;ee it; Mrs. Beau|mont having expre&s;&s;ed to her her indignation again&s;t Olivia on the occa&s;ion. Unworthy Olivia! What reflexions can you ca&s;t on the admirable Clementina!
<PB N="226" REF="227">
&mdash;Yet I wi&s;h Mrs. Beaumont would let me &s;ee them.&mdash;But dear Mrs. Beaumont, impart not to Clemen|tina any thing that may affect her delicate and too &s;crupulous mind!</P>
<P>This over-lively Lady G. has been acquainting Lady Clementina with Emily's &s;tory, yet intending to &s;et forth nothing by it, &s;he &s;ays, but the fortitude of &s;o young a creature.</P>
<P>She owns, that Lady Clementina often reddened as &s;he proceeded in it; yet that &s;he went on&mdash;How <HI>could</HI> &s;he?&mdash;I chid her for poor Emily's &s;ake, for her own &s;ake, for Lady Clementina's, for Sir Edward Beauchamp's &s;ake&mdash;How could &s;he be &s;o indelicate? Is there a nece&s;&s;ity, dear Lady G. (thought I, as &s;he repeated what pa&s;&s;ed on the occa&s;ion) now you are &s;o right in the great articles of your duty, that you mu&s;t be wrong in <HI>&s;omething?</HI></P>
<P>Lady Clementina highly applauded Emily, how|ever. A charming young creature &s;he called her. Ab&s;ence, added &s;he, is certainly a right mea&s;ure. Were the man a common man, it would not &s;ignify: Pre&s;ence, in that ca&s;e, might help her, as he probably would every Day expo&s;e his Faults to her ob&s;ervation. But ab&s;ence from &s;uch a man as Sir Charles Grandi|&s;on, is certainly right. Lady G. &s;ays, it was ea&s;y to &s;ee that Lady Clementina made &s;ome &s;elf-applications upon it.</P>

<P>LADY G. has been communicating to me a con|ference which &s;he &s;ays, &s;he could not <HI>but</HI> overhear, between Lady Clementina and Mrs. Beaumont, held in the clo&s;et of the latter, which joins to a clo&s;et in Lady G's dre&s;&s;ing-room, &s;eparated only by a thin par|tition. The rooms were once one&mdash;A little of your u&s;ual <HI>curio&s;ity,</HI> I doubt, my dear Lady G. thought I. You were not <HI>confined</HI> to that clo&s;et. You might have retired when their conver&s;ation begun. But, no; Cu|rio&s;ity is a nail, that will fa&s;ten to the ground, the
<PB N="227" REF="228">
foot of an inqui&s;itive Per&s;on, however painful, what &s;he hears may &s;ometimes make her &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Mrs. Beamont had acquainted Lady Clementina with the contents of the Letter &s;he had received from her Friends at Florence. The poor Lady was in tears upon it. She called Olivia cruel, unju&s;t, wicked. The very <HI>&s;urmize,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, is of &s;uch a nature, that I cannot bear to look either Lady Grandi&s;on, or any of her friends in the face: For Heaven's &s;ake, let it not be hinted to any one in the family, nor even to my own relations, that Olivia <HI>her&s;elf</HI> could be capa|ble of making &s;uch a reflexion upon me.</P>
<P>My deare&s;t Lady Clementina, &s;aid Mrs. Beaumont, I wi&s;h&mdash;</P>
<P>What wi&s;heth my dear Mrs. Beaumont&mdash;</P>
<P>That you would change your &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>ARTICLES, Mrs. Beaumont! ARTICLES!&mdash;If they are broken with me, I re&s;ume my &s;olicitude to be allowed to take the veil. That allowance, and that only, can &s;et all right. My heart is di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by what you have let me &s;ee Olivia has dared to throw out again&s;t me.</P>
<P>Allow me one ob&s;ervation only, my dear Clemen|tina. What Olivia has hinted, the <HI>world</HI> will hint. It behoves you to con&s;ider, that the Hu&s;band of Lady Grandi&s;on ought not to be &s;o much the object of any woman's attention, as to be an ob&s;tacle to the addre&s;s of another man really worthy.</P>
<P>Cruel, cruel Olivia! There is no bearing the <HI>thought</HI> of her vile &s;ugge&s;tion. None but Olivia&mdash;Say not the <HI>world.</HI> Olivia <HI>only,</HI> Mrs. Beaumont, was capable of &s;uch a &s;ugge&s;tion&mdash;</P>
<P>For my own part, interrupted Mrs. Beaumont, I am confident that it is a ba&s;e &s;ugge&s;tion; and that if Sir Charles Grandi&s;on had <HI>not</HI> been married, you ne|ver would have been his. You could not have receded from your former objections. You &s;ee what a deter|mined Prote&s;tant he is; a Prote&s;tant upon principle.
<PB N="228" REF="229">
You are equally &s;teady in your Faith: Yet as mat|ters &s;tand; &s;o amiable as he is; and the more his pri|vate Life and manners are &s;een, the more to be ad|mired; mu&s;t not your <HI>be&s;t friends</HI> lay it at the Door of a fir&s;t Love, that you cannot give way to the addre&s;s of a man again&s;t whom no one other objection can lie?</P>
<P>ARTICLES, Mrs. Beaumont! ARTICLES!&mdash;</P>
<P>One word more only, my dear Lady Clementina, as the &s;ubject was begun by your&s;elf&mdash;May it not be expected, now that no oppo&s;ition is given you, you will begin to feel, that your happine&s;s, and peace, and <HI>&s;trength</HI> of mind will flow from turning your thoughts on principles of <HI>Duty</HI> (&s;o the world will call them) to other objects; and that the dwelling on tho&s;e it will <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> you to dwell upon, till your &s;ituation is vi&s;ibly altered, will &s;erve only to di&s;turb your mind, and fill your friends, on every in&s;tance that may affect it, with apprehen&s;ions for you?</P>
<P>You have &s;aid a great deal, Mrs. Beaumont. But is not the veil the only po&s;&s;ible expedient to make us all ea&s;y?</P>
<P>ARTICLES, ARTICLES! my dear Clementina. I have been drawn in by your&s;elf in&s;en&s;ibly to &s;peak my mind on this &s;ubject. But I have no view, no de&s;ign. Your Parents, your Brothers, you &s;ee, in|violably adhere to the Articles. But, con&s;ider, my dear, were you even allowed to a&s;&s;ume the veil, that all &s;uch recollections of your former inclination as would be faulty in a married &s;tate, would have been equally contrary to your religious Vows. Would then the a&s;&s;uming of the veil make you happy?</P>
<P>Don't you hint, Olivia-like, Mrs. Beaumont, at <HI>culpable</HI> inclinations? Do you impute to me <HI>culpable</HI> inclinations?</P>
<P>I do not, neither do I think you are ab&s;olutely as yet an Angel. Would you, my dear, refu&s;e your vows to the Count of Belvedere, or any other man,
<PB N="226" REF="230">
for a <HI>certain</HI> rea&s;on, yet think your&s;elf free enough to give them to your God?</P>
<P>Will this Argument hold, Mrs. Beaumont, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e?</P>
<P>You will call upon ARTICLES, my dear, if I pro|ceed. Your &s;ilence, however, is encouraging. What were ju&s;t now your ob&s;ervations upon the &s;tory of Mi&s;s Emily Jervois: Is there not a re&s;emblance between her ca&s;e and yours?</P>
<P>Surely, madam, I am not &s;uch a girl!&mdash;O Mrs. Beaumont, how am I &s;unk in your opinion!</P>
<P>You are <HI>not,</HI> my dear Clementina, you cannot in any-body's. Mi&s;s Jervois is under obligations to her guardian, that you are not.</P>
<P>Is that, Mrs. Beaumont, all the difference?&mdash;That makes none. I am under greater. What are pecuniary obligations to the pre&s;ervation of a brother's life? To a hundred other in&s;tances of goodne&s;s&mdash;That girl <HI>my</HI> pattern! Poor, poor Clementina! How art thou fallen! Let me fly this country.&mdash;Now I &s;ee in the &s;tronge&s;t Light, what a ra&s;hne&s;s I was guilty of, when I fled to it. How mu&s;t the Cheva|lier Grandi&s;on him&s;elf de&s;pi&s;e me!&mdash;But I tell you, Mrs. Beaumont, that I am incapable of a wi&s;h, of a thought, contrary to tho&s;e that determined me when I declined the hand of the be&s;t of men. O that I were in my own Italy!&mdash;What mu&s;t young Creatures &s;uffer from the love of an improper object, in the opinion of their friends, if, after the &s;acrifices I have made, I mu&s;t lie under di&s;graceful imputations from my gratitude and e&s;teem for the mo&s;t worthy of human minds?&mdash;O how I di&s;dain my&s;elf!</P>
<P>It is a generous di&s;dain, my dear lady Clementina. I end as I began&mdash;I wi&s;h you would think of chang|ing your &s;y&s;tem. But I leave the whole upon your own con&s;ideration. Your parents are pa&s;&s;ive. God direct you. I wi&s;h you happy. At pre&s;ent you will not your&s;elf &s;ay you are &s;o. Yet nobody controuls

<P>Lady G. believes the conver&s;ation ended here.</P>
<P>Lady L. in Mrs. Beaumont's pre&s;ence, has been ju&s;t making me a compliment on my <HI>generous</HI> Love, as &s;he calls it, of Lady Clementina, and my &s;ecurity in Sir Charles's affection. Dear madam, &s;aid I, where is the merit? A man of &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hed principles and a woman of &s;uch delicate honour! They both of them move my pity, and engage my love. With regard to Lady Clementina, this is my con&s;olation, that I &s;tood not in her way: That your Brother never made his addre&s;&s;es to me, till &s;he, on the noble&s;t mo|tives, left him free to choo&s;e the <HI>next</HI> eligible, as I have rea&s;on to think he allowed me to be. And let me tell you, my dear Mrs. Beaumont, that in his addre&s;s to me, he did her ju&s;tice; and dealt &s;o nobly with me, that had I not before preferred him to all other men, I &s;hould have done it then.</P>

<P>I HAVE received a Letter from Sir Charles. Lady Clementina and I were together when it was brought. She &s;eeing whom it came from, and that I mediated the &s;eal with Impatience, begged me to read it then, or &s;he would withdraw. I opened it. There were in it, I told her, the polite&s;t remembrances of her, and the other ladies; and read what he wrote of that nature. She looked with &s;o de&s;iring an eye at it, that I &s;aid, were you to read it, madam, you would find him the kinde&s;t of men. Sir Charles and I have not a &s;ecret between us. But there are in it a pa&s;&s;age or two, relating to a certain gentleman, that, were you to read it, might affect you. [By the way &s;he reads Engli&s;h extremely well.] And is that, Lady Grandi&s;on, your <HI>only</HI> objection? I &s;hould be glad to
<PB N="231" REF="232">
&s;ee, were it not improper, how the polite&s;t of men writes to the be&s;t of wives.</P>
<P>I gave her the Letter.</P>
<P>She had greatne&s;s of mind to be delighted with his affectionate &s;tile&mdash;Tender delicacy! &s;aid &s;he, as &s;he read:&mdash;Happy, happy Lady Grandi&s;on! Tears in her eyes, and cla&s;ping her arms about me, let me thus congratulate you. I acted right in declining his addre&s;s. I mu&s;t have thought well of the religion of the man, who could &s;peak, who could write, who could act, who could live, as he does,</P>
<P>I bowed my face on her Shoulder. To have ex|pre&s;&s;ed but half the admiration I had in my heart of her noblene&s;s of mind, would have been to hint to her the delicate &s;ituation &s;he <HI>had</HI> been in, and to wonder how &s;he could overcome her&s;elf.</P>
<P>What follows, &s;aid &s;he, &s;itting down, I pre&s;ume I may read: For my eye has caught the name of a man my heart can pity.</P>
<P>She read to her&s;elf the pa&s;&s;age, which is to the fol|lowing effect: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The <HI>per&s;on</HI> of the poor Count of Belvedere" (Sir Charles writes, in the Count's words) "is loitering in town, endeavouring to divert it&s;elf there; while his <HI>&s;oul</HI> is at Grandi&s;on-hall. He cannot think of quitting England, till he has taken leave of Lady Clementina; yet, dreading the pangs he &s;hall feel on that occa&s;ion, he cannot bring him&s;elf to undergo them."</Q></P>
<P>The Marqui&s;s, the Bi&s;hop, Signor Jeronymo, all joined, Sir Charles writes, to con&s;ole him; yet wi&s;hed him to pur&s;ue his better fortune at Madrid; and the Count thinks of prevailing on him&s;elf to accompany them down, in order to take this dreaded Farewel. Sir Charles expre&s;&s;es his pity for him; but applauds the whole family for their inviolable adherence to their agreement.</P>
<P>When &s;he read to that place, tears &s;tole down her cheeks&mdash;Agreement, &s;aid &s;he,&mdash;Ah, Lady Gran|di&s;on!
<PB N="232" REF="233">
It is true, they <HI>&s;peak</HI> not: But I can read their <HI>wi&s;hes</HI> in their eyes.</P>
<P>She read on Sir Charles's prai&s;es of the Count for his beneficent &s;pirit. The Count, &s;aid &s;he, is cer|tainly a good man&mdash;But is not his, a &s;trange per&s;e|verance? Then, giving me the Letter, How few of us know, &s;aid &s;he, what is be&s;t for our&s;elves! There is a Lady in Spain of great honour and merit, who would make him a much happier man, than <HI>&s;he</HI> can do, on whom he has ca&s;t a partial eye. And be&s;ides there is the poor Laurana&mdash;</P>
<P>She &s;topt. I &s;uffered the &s;ubject to end there.</P>
<P>Sir Charles &s;uppo&s;es it will be the latter end of next week before they return, if the Marquis holds his pur|po&s;e of being pre&s;ent at a Ball to which he is invited by the Venetian amba&s;&s;ador&mdash;Near a fortnight's ab&s;ence on the whole!&mdash;O dear! O dear!</P>
<P>The following by Lady G.</P>
<P>And <HI>O dear! O dear!</HI> &s;ay I! This is Saturday, and not a word more written. <HI>So</HI> taken up with her walks and walking-mate!&mdash;Selfi&s;hs creature both. It was with difficulty I procured a fight of this Letter. No wonder. You &s;ee how freely &s;he has treated me in it. I told her, it never would be fini&s;hed, if I did not fini&s;h it for her. Her excu&s;e is, Sir Charles's ab&s;ence, and that you, madam, charged her <HI>not</HI> to write by <HI>every</HI> po&s;t, le&s;t an accidental omi&s;&s;ion &s;hould make you unea&s;y.&mdash;Ungrateful for indulgence given!

<P>My Lord and I are one now: If therefore I &s;ay, <HI>I</HI> arrived, it is the &s;ame as &s;aying, <HI>he</HI> did: My little Harriet with us, you may be &s;ure.</P>
<P>But what does the girl complain for? Maiden crea|tures &s;hould &s;end us married women two Letters for one. E&s;tabli&s;h for me this expectation: You will &s;oon your&s;elf be the better for the doctrine.</P>
<P>You tell me, that hardly any of your girls are &s;atis|fied with my imperial deci&s;ion on the appeal laid before me, tho' &s;upported by the opinions of Mrs. Shirley, Lady D. and every wi&s;e woman.

In hopes they will confirm your own; if not, to be &s;aucy, and reject them.</P>
<P>You want me to tell you a hundred thou&s;and things, of what's doing, what's done, what's &s;aid, here? Not I. Harriet is writing a long, long Letter to her grand|mamma, &s;he tells me; and journalwi&s;e <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Meaning the preceding Letter.</NOTE>.&mdash;Let that when you have it, content you.

<P>Lady Clementina is a noble creature. We are obliged to call both her and Harriet to order; or they would never be a&s;under. The garden and park are the places in which they mo&s;t delight to walk. Make Harriet give you the particulars of their conver&s;a|tions.&mdash;Then I &s;hall have them. I have demanded them; but &s;he only acquaints me in general, that &s;he is delighted with Lady Clementina's part in them. The other expre&s;&s;es no le&s;s admiration of Harriet's. But, be&s;ides that they rob us of their com|pany too often, which is ruder in the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e than in the gue&s;t; Harriet does not enough con&s;ider her own circum&s;tances. Their walks are too long. She comes in, and throws her&s;elf &s;ome|times into a chair&mdash;<HI>&s;o</HI> tired!&mdash;Yet, chidden for her long walks, <HI>&s;uch</HI> engaging conver&s;ations! &s;he cries out&mdash;<HI>Heroines</HI> both, I &s;uppo&s;e; and they are mir|rors to each other; each admiring her&s;elf <HI>in</HI> the other. No wonder they are engaged in&s;en&s;ibly by a vanity, which carries with it, to each, &s;o generous an appear|ance; for all the while, Harriet thinks &s;he is only ad|miring Clementina; Clementina, that &s;he's applauding Harriet.</P>

<P>I AM afraid your brother James will terrify you all. Surpri&s;ing;&mdash;I am very angry with him; for, how|ever &s;light he might make of what I have to tell you, I know, that none of you be&s;ides will.

But why do I a&s;k? this is ea&s;ily accounted for: She was over-&s;atigued with a walk. Again&s;t warning, again&s;t threatenings, &s;he and Lady Cle|mentina had taken a longer walk than ever they did
<PB N="236" REF="237">
before, quite to the end of the park, to view &s;ome al|terations which Sir Charles was making there. They had forgotten that they had the &s;ame length to walk back again. Half-way on their return, tired, and each accu&s;ing her&s;elf, and apologizing to the other, they were &s;urprized by a &s;udden &s;hower of rain; a vi|olent one; a thunder-&s;hower: No &s;helter: They were forced to run for it towards a di&s;tant tree; which when they approached, they found wet thro'; as they both were. So they made the be&s;t of their way to the hou&s;e; were &s;een at a little di&s;tance, mak|ing the appearance of frighted hares. The &s;ervants ran to them with clokes, which, thrown over their wet cloaths, helped to load them. As Harriet en|tered the hall-door, which leads into the garden, &s;he was &s;urpri&s;ed with the &s;ight of Sir Charles, entering at the other. She expected him not till Friday or Saturday. Her complexion changed: She &s;ighed; &s;obbed: Her cheeks, her lips turned pale: Down &s;he was &s;inking. My brother was terrified; but he caught her in his arms, and &s;aved her fall.</P>
<P>Lady L. and I were together, indulging our&s;elves with our little nur&s;eries, who were crowing at each other; I &s;inging to both [by the way they are &s;ur|pri&s;ing infants] when word was brought, that my Brother was come, and Lady Grandi&s;on was dying. How were we both terrified! We, in our fright, each popt her pug into the arms of the other, by way of ridding our hands of our own; and the women being not at hand, threw the &s;miling brats into one cradle; and down hurried we to our Harriet.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of all this bu&s;tle, this wi&s;e Brother of yours, Lucy, &s;lipt away without taking leave of us. What tho' his hour was fixed, and his po&s;t-chai&s;e waiting, could he not have &s;taid one half-hour? O the&s;e incon&s;iderate, hare-brain'd&mdash;Don't be angry, Lucy, he has vex'd us for you.

and recovery. She has got cold: So has her &s;i&s;ter|excellence, as my Brother ju&s;tly calls her. Is it to be wondered at?&mdash;She was feveri&s;h all day ye&s;terday; but made &s;light of it; and would have come down to dinner; but we would not permit her to leave her chamber.</P>
<P>How was Lady Clementina affected! She laid all at her own door: And la&s;t night, Harriet being &s;till more feveri&s;h, &punc;we all talked our&s;elves into a thou&s;and panies. Lady Clementina was not to be pacified.</P>
<P>To-day, &s;he is, in a manner, quite well; and we are all joy upon it. But &s;he &s;hall never again do the honours of the Park to Lady Clementina. Tru&s;t <HI>me</HI> for that, grandmamma Shirley; and expect a Letter from the dear creature her&s;elf by the po&s;t. Adieu, adieu, Lucy, every body, in a violent hurry &s;ub|&s;cribes</P>

<P>I AM &s;orry, my deare&s;t grandmamma, you have all been &s;o much alarmed by an indi&s;po&s;ition which is already gone off. My cou&s;in James, fooli&s;h youth! I wi&s;h he had not called upon us on his return from Port&s;mouth, or that he had &s;taid at Grandi&s;on-hall till now. Lady G. has given you, in her lively way, an account of the girli&s;h incon&s;ideration, which might have been attended with a fever, had not Mr. Low|ther been at hand; who thought it advi&s;eable that I

&s;hould lo&s;e blood. But it was the joy on &s;eeing Sir Charles after an ab&s;ence of eight days, and &s;everal days &s;ooner than I had expected that plea&s;ure, which overcame me.</P>
<P>Never, never, <HI>was</HI> there &s;o tender, &s;o affectionate, &s;o indulgent a hu&s;band!&mdash;Lady G. has told you that I fainted away&mdash;When recovered, I found my&s;elf in his arms; all our friends and gue&s;ts a&s;&s;embled round me; every one expre&s;&s;ing <HI>&s;uch</HI> a tender concern.</P>
<P>Harriet, be grateful! But can&s;t thou be enough &s;o? How art thou beloved of hearts the mo&s;t worthy!&mdash;And what new proofs ha&s;t thou received of that Love of all other the deare&s;t! Every hour do I experience &s;ome new in&s;tance of his tender goodne&s;s. He &s;tirred not from my chamber for half an hour together, for two whole days and nights. All the re&s;t he took was in a chair by my bed-&s;ide; and very little was his re&s;t: Yet, ble&s;&s;ed be God! his health &s;uffered not. Every cordial, every medicine, did he admini&s;ter to me with his own hands. He regarded not any-body but his Harriet. The world, he told me, was nothing to him without his Harriet. So amiably has he appeared in this new light, not in my fond eyes only, but in tho&s;e of all here; who are continually congratulating me upon it; and every one telling me little circum&s;tances of his kind attention, and anxious fondne&s;s, as &s;ome happened to ob&s;erve one, &s;ome another, that tho' I wanted not proofs before of his affection for me, I cannot account my indi&s;po&s;ition an unhappine&s;s; e&s;pe|cially as it has gone off without the con&s;equences, of which you were &s;o very apprehen&s;ive.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Dear Sir, I obey you: But indeed, Sir, writing to my grandmamma does me good.

<P>I HAVE a con&s;tant attendant in Lady Clementina. She was not to be con&s;oled when I was at wor&s;t.

<P>SIGNOR Jeronymo has been pitying to me the Count of Belvedere. The poor man could not pre|vail upon him&s;elf to accompany Sir Charles and his noble gue&s;ts down. He owned to Jeronymo, that he had twice &s;et out for Grandi&s;on-hall; but both times, being unable to pur&s;ue his intention, turned back.</P>
<P>Jeronymo told me, that the Count had made his will, and left all that he could leave, and his whole per&s;onal e&s;tate, to their family, in ca&s;e he &s;hould die unmarried. He would not leave it to Lady Clemen|tina, left, if his beque&s;ts were to come to her know|ledge, &s;he &s;hould think he was &s;o mean, as to expect that favour from his riches, of which he had no hope from her e&s;teem.</P>
<P>The generous Belvedere declares, &s;aid Jeronymo, that &s;hould her malady be renewed by means of our intere&s;ting our&s;elves in his favour, he &s;hould be the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of men. My dear Jeronymo, &s;aid he, at parting in town, tell that Angel of a Woman, that
<PB N="240" REF="241">
I never will &s;olicit her favour, while I &s;hall have rea|&s;on to apprehend &s;he has an aver&s;ion to me. May Cle|mentina be happy, and Belvedere mu&s;t have &s;ome con&s;olation from knowing her to be &s;o, however wretched he may be on the whole. But a&s;&s;ure your|&s;elf, Jeronymo, that I will never be the hu&s;band of any other woman, while &s;he is unmarried.</P>
<P>I joined with Signor Jeronymo in pitying the Count: Yet, I mu&s;t own, that my compa&s;&s;ion is &s;till more deep|ly engaged for Clementina. But I was affected not a little, however, when Jeronymo read a pa&s;&s;age from a Letter of the Count, which, at my reque&s;t, he le&s;t with me; and which I Engli&s;h as follows:&mdash;After his &s;upplicatious put up to Heaven for her happine&s;s, whatever became of him&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"But can &s;he be happy,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"in her pre&s;ent &s;ituation? may there not be always a &s;truggle between her exalted notion of duty, and her pa&s;&s;ion (tho' the noble&s;t that ever warmed a human brea&s;t) which may renew the di&s;orders of her mind?&mdash;Were &s;he <HI>mine</HI>&mdash;(Let me indulge, for one moment, the rapturous &s;uppo&s;i|tion) I could hope to conduct, to guide, to com|po&s;e, that noble mind.

<P>MY Cou&s;in James <HI>has</HI> &s;een me, and I have chid him <HI>too,</HI> for having been &s;o ha&s;ty to carry bad news
<PB N="241" REF="242">
to Northampton&s;hire, without &s;taying a day or two, when he might have carried better. 'Tis true, they will not permit me to quit my chamber yet: But that is rather for precautionary than nece&s;&s;ary rea&s;ons; and they have given over chiding me for writing&mdash;Their in|dulgence to me of my pen will convince you, that I am quite well.</P>
<P>Lady Clementina mo&s;t &s;incerely rejoices in my reco|very. Yet &s;he is every day more and more thoughtful and &s;olemn. She is grieved, &s;he tells her mother (who is troubled at her Solemnity) for her brother Jerony|mo, who indeed is not well. Mr. Lowther tells us, that he mu&s;t not expect to be exampt from temporary pains and di&s;order: But I am &s;ure the worthy man would be ea&s;ier in his own mind, were his &s;i&s;ter to give her hand to the Count of Belvedere.</P>
<P>I talked to Sir Charles on this &s;ubject an hour ago. Lady Clementina, my dear Sir, &s;aid I, is not happy. I que&s;tion whether &s;he ever will, unle&s;s &s;he is allowed her own way, the veil.</P>
<P>And that, returned he, has been &s;o long a family|objection, that the compliance with her wi&s;hes, would break the heart of her mother, at lea&s;t; and greatly afilict all the re&s;t. It mu&s;t not, for <HI>their</HI> &s;akes, be thought of.</P>
<P>What then, Sir, can be done?</P>
<P>We mu&s;t have patience, my deare&s;t life. Her ma|lady has un&s;ettled her noble mind. She mu&s;t try her own &s;chemes; and if &s;he find not happine&s;s in any of them, &s;he will think of new ones, till at la&s;t &s;he fixes. Nor, I hope, is the time far off.</P>
<P>Do you think &s;o, Sir?</P>
<P>Don't you &s;ee, my Love, that the poor Lady is more and more unea&s;y with her&s;elf? Something is working in her mind. I have de&s;ired her mother to leave that di&s;turbed mind to its own generous workings. Her vehemence, rai&s;ed by the oppo&s;ition &s;he met with, which &s;he con&s;idered as a per&s;ecution, has for &s;ome
<PB N="242" REF="243">
time &s;ub&s;ided; and &s;he will probably fall upon reflexi|ons which &s;he had not time to attend to before.</P>
<P>Jeronymo thinks, proceeded he, that <HI>I</HI> might &s;uc|ce&s;sfully plead in the Count's favour&mdash;But did I not draw the articles? Did I not propo&s;e the terms? Lady Clementina &s;hall not be prevaricated with. She &s;huns me of late&mdash;In apprehen&s;ion, perhaps, that I will try my influence over her. She never &s;eems &s;o ea&s;y, as when &s;he is with my deare&s;t Love. You mu&s;t pre&s;erve that con&s;equence with her, which delicate minds will ever be of to one another. Some little appearances of her malady will perhaps, now-and-then, &s;hew them|&s;elves, and un&s;ettle her: But I have no doubt, if it plea&s;e God to pre&s;erve her rea&s;on, that her pre&s;ent un|ea&s;ine&s;&s;es will be productive of &s;ome great change in her &s;chemes, which may end in a tranquillity of mind, that will make all us who love her, happy. Mean|time, my dear, let this be our rule, if you plea&s;e: Let <HI>her</HI> lead; let <HI>us</HI> only follow&mdash;Per&s;ua&s;ion again&s;t avowed inclination, you and I, my Harriet, have al|ways condemned as a degree of compul&s;ion. Had the admirable Lady been <HI>entreated</HI> to take the noble mea&s;ure &s;he fell upon, when &s;he rejected me, however great the motives, &s;he would not have been &s;o happy, as &s;he was, when &s;he found her&s;elf ab&s;olute mi&s;tre&s;s of the que&s;tion, and could a&s;toni&s;h and &s;urpri&s;e us all by her magnanimity.</P>
<P>Who could re&s;i&s;t this rea&s;oning? How well does he &s;eem to know this excellent woman, when he con|&s;iders her unhappy unfixedne&s;s, occa&s;ioned by a ma|lady, which will now-and-then (till &s;he can be &s;ettled in &s;ome quiet and agreeable way) &s;hew it&s;elf in her conduct, when &s;he has any great part before her to act!</P>

<P>LADY Clementina, &s;oon after dinner, &s;ent up to me her Camilia (for I was not at table) to de&s;ire a quarter of an hour's di&s;cour&s;e with me in my cham|ber.
<PB N="243" REF="244">
I gave direction, that nobody &s;hould come to me till I rang. She entered; &s;aw me &s;eated; took her &s;eat by me; and immediately, with a noble frankne&s;s in her manner, thus began:</P>
<P>I could not, my dear Lady Grandi&s;on, a&s;k the fa|vour of your ear on the &s;ubject I wanted to open my heart upon to you, till I &s;aw you were perfectly reco|vered. God be prai&s;ed, that you are! What anxieties did your late indi&s;po&s;ition give me! I accu&s;ed my&s;elf as the cau&s;e of it.&mdash;I had engaged you, thoughtle&s;ly, in too long a walk. You know how Lady G. how Lady L. were terrified. I overheard them once that evening talking over their fears to one another. Lady G. looked with vi&s;ible unkindne&s;s upon me. My aid ineffectual, my per&s;on in the <HI>way,</HI> I hurried to my chamber: Good God! &s;aid I (every object looking &s;trange about me) Where am I? What am I? Can I be the &s;ame Clementina della Porretta that I was a few months ago? Can I have brought mi&s;ery to the family which was my only re&s;uge? To the man who&mdash;[She pau&s;ed: Then lifting up her eyes; Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin! &s;aid &s;he, And <HI>is</HI> Clementina in the hou&s;e of the man whom &s;he has been known to regard above all men; and whom &s;he &s;till <HI>does</HI> regard; but not as Olivia &s;up|po&s;es?] And then on my knees I offered up fervent prayers for your health and happine&s;s; and that it would plea&s;e God to return me, with reputation, to my native country. My eyes are now opened to the impropriety I have been guilty of in taking re|fuge in England; and in remaining in it, and in your hou&s;e, and with a man whom I am known to value. The world had begun to <HI>talk:</HI> Cruel Olivia! She will lead and point the talk, as &s;he would have it be|lieved. I am under obligation to your goodne&s;s, and to that of all your friends, that they and you think kindly of me, &s;ituated as I once was. I am obliged (Mortifying con&s;ideration to a &s;pirit like mine!) to Sir Charles Grandi&s;on's genero&s;ity and compa&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="244" REF="245">
that he does not de&s;pi&s;e me. A <HI>girl</HI> (forgive me for mentioning it; it is to <HI>you</HI> only) has been, by my dear Mrs. Beaumont, propo&s;ed, indirectly at lea&s;t, for a Pattern to me. How am I &s;unk! My pride cannot bear it. Had I been allowed to take the veil, all the&s;e improprieties in my conduct had been pre|vented; all the&s;e mortifications would have been &s;pared the unhappy Clementina&mdash;Tell me, advi&s;e me, May I not renew my entreaties to be allowed to take the veil? Give me, as to your &s;i&s;ter (no &s;i&s;ter ever loved her &s;i&s;ter better than I love you) your ad|vice: Coun&s;el me what to do, what cour&s;e to &s;teer, to recover my&s;elf in my own eyes. At pre&s;ent I hate, I de&s;pi&s;e, my&s;elf.</P>
<P>With how little rea&s;on, my deare&s;t &s;i&s;ter, my ex|cellent friend! All my family revere you: Sir Charles, his Si&s;ters, and I, love you: Lady G. particularly admires you: She could not po&s;&s;ibly look unkindly upon you. What has Olivia dared to report? But did &s;he ever forbear her ra&s;h cen&s;ures?&mdash;What can I advi&s;e you? I &s;ee your delicate di&s;tre&s;s. But &s;uppo&s;e you open your mind to the Marchione&s;s? To Mrs. Beaumont &s;uppo&s;e? She is the mo&s;t prudent of women.</P>
<P>I know <HI>their</HI> minds already. Their judgments are not with me. Mrs. Beaumont (indeed without intend|ing it) has terrified me. My mamma thinks her&s;elf bound by the Articles, and will not &s;peak.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e, my deare&s;t Lady, you advi&s;e with Sir Charles? You know he is the mo&s;t delicate-minded of men.</P>
<P>I &s;hall ever honour him: But your indi&s;po&s;ition has made me look upon him with more reverence than familiarity. I have avoided him. An exqui&s;ite pain has &s;eized my heart, on being brought to meditate the impropriety of my &s;ituation: A pain I cannot de&s;cribe. <HI>Here</HI> it u&s;ed to be (putting her hand to her fore-head);
<PB N="245" REF="246">
but <HI>here</HI> now it is (removing it to her heart); and at times I cannot bear it.</P>
<P>Let me beg of Lady Clementina to lay that noble heart open to Sir Charles. You know his di&s;intere&s;t|ed affection for you. You know his regard for your glory. You know that your own mother, your own Mrs. Beaumont, are not more delicate than he is. You may unbo&s;om your&s;elf to him. But &s;uch is his fear of offending you, that you mu&s;t begin. A &s;mall opening will do. His nice regard for your ho|nour, for the honour of our &s;ex, will, on a &s;light en|couragement, &s;pare you all that would be irk&s;ome to you. He has no prejudices in favour or disfavour of any body. He loves, it is true, he reveres your <HI>whole family;</HI> but <HI>you</HI> more than all the re&s;t. Shall I &s;ay that he made his court to me in your name, and by your intere&s;t; yet acknowledged him&s;elf refu&s;ed by an Angel?</P>
<P>Excellent man!&mdash;I <HI>will</HI> con&s;ult him, and in your pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>As to my pre&s;ence, madam&mdash;</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be &s;o, interrupted &s;he: I &s;hall want your &s;upport. Do <HI>you</HI> be my advocate with him; and if he will be an advocate for me, I may yet be happy. At pre&s;ent, I &s;ee but one way to extricate my&s;elf with honour. <HI>I</HI> dare not propo&s;e it. <HI>He</HI> may. The world and Olivia will not let me be, <HI>in</HI> that world, a &s;ingle woman, and happy.&mdash;Why &s;hould I not be allowed to quit it by a divine dedication?</P>
<P>I embraced her; &s;oothed her: But thought of Sir Charles's advice, not to <HI>lead,</HI> but <HI>follow</HI> as &s;he led: Not one word, as I told her, would I &s;ay to him of what had pa&s;&s;ed between us, that &s;he might have his own unprejudiced advice.</P>
<P>I rang, by her permi&s;&s;ion. Sally came up. I made my reque&s;t, by her, to her ma&s;ter. He found us to|gether. Sir Charles, &s;aid I, before he could &s;peak,

<P>THE conference was held in Italian. It was but ju&s;t turned of &s;even in the morning, when we met in my drawing-room.</P>
<P>I had told Lady Clementina that &s;he mu&s;t lead the &s;ubject; but Sir Charles, &s;eeing her in &s;ome confu&s;ion, relieved her&mdash;You do me, madam, &s;aid he, great ho|nour (and it is worthy of our brotherly and &s;i&s;terly friend&s;hip in propo&s;ing to a&s;k my opinion on any &s;ub|ject in which you are intere&s;ted. <HI>Our</HI> dear Harriet's recovery (God be prai&s;ed for it!) has left no wi&s;h in my heart &s;o ardent as for <HI>your</HI> happine&s;s. Permit me to &s;ay, my dear Lady Clementina, it is <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> for that of us both.</P>
<P>Indeed, madam, it <HI>is,</HI> &s;aid I, taking her hand. Tenderne&s;s, love, re&s;pect, I am &s;ure, were in my countenance, if it &s;poke my heart. She conde&s;cend|ingly bowed upon mine: Tears were in her eyes: You pain me, Chevalier, you pain me, madam, by your goodne&s;s&mdash;How many of my friends have I made un|happy!</P>
<P>For &s;ome days pa&s;t, &s;aid Sir Charles, I have ob|&s;erved, that you have &s;eemed more unea&s;y than u&s;ual. Would to Heaven it were in my power to remove the cau&s;e!</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="248">
Perhaps it <HI>may.</HI> Ah, Chevalier! I thought when I came into the compromi&s;e, that I might have made my|&s;elf happier in it, than I now find I can be.</P>
<P><HI>Dear</HI> Lady Clementina! &s;aid Sir Charles; and &s;topt.</P>
<P>Be not di&s;plea&s;ed with me, Chevalier. I mu&s;t hold my&s;elf bound by it, if it be in&s;i&s;ted on. But tho' my conde&s;cending friends urge me not by entreaties, by per&s;ua&s;ions, &s;ee you not that their <HI>wi&s;hing eyes,</HI> and <HI>&s;ighing hearts,</HI> break every hour the Articles agreed to?</P>
<P>Dear Lady Clementina!</P>
<P>I knew you would be angry with me.</P>
<P>I am not. It would be equally unfriendly and in&s;o|lent if I were. But, my dear Clementina, what an affecting picture have you drawn of the re&s;ignation of parents to the will of their child, in an article which their hearts were fixed upon.</P>
<P>Add not weight, Sir, to my unea&s;y reflexions. I can hardly bear to &s;ee in them the generous &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of their own wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>She then addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to me.&mdash;Bear with me, dear Lady Grandi&s;on, if I ca&s;t an eye back to former &s;ituations. You know my whole &s;tory.&mdash;For a few moments bear with me.&mdash;I never, God is my wit|ne&s;s, envied you. On the contrary, I rejoiced to find tho&s;e merits which I had not power to reward, &s;o <HI>amply</HI> rewarded by you; and that the Chevalier was &s;o great a gainer by my declining his vows.&mdash;She &s;topt.</P>
<P>Proceed, deare&s;t Lady Clementina, &s;aid I&mdash;Are we not &s;i&s;ters? And do I not know, that yours is the no|ble&s;t of female minds?</P>
<P>I rejoice, Sir, from my heart, that I was enabled to act as I did.&mdash;</P>
<P>Again &s;he &s;topt. Sir Charles bowed in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>But &s;till I hoped, that one day my parents would have been overcome in favour of the divine dedica|tion.
<PB N="248" REF="249">
That was always my wi&s;h, till you, Sir, indu|ced me to come into a compromi&s;e. And then I was re&s;olved to make my&s;elf, if po&s;&s;ible, happy, in the &s;ingle Life allowed me. But what <HI>can</HI> I do? My for|mer wi&s;hes recur. I cannot help it: And it &s;eems evident to me, that there is but one mea&s;ure, and that is the convent, which can make me happy.</P>
<P>Dear Lady Clementino! &s;aid Sir Charles, will you be plea&s;ed to allow me&mdash;</P>
<P>Olivia, Sir, interrupted &s;he (you don't, perhaps, know that) reflects upon me. It was indeed a ra&s;h &s;tep which I took, when I fled to England: How has it countenanced the excur&s;ion <HI>&s;he</HI> made hither? Tho', God knows, our motives were widely different: Hers was to obtain what mine was intended to avoid. But your &s;udden indi&s;po&s;ition, madam, pointed the &s;ting, and carried it into my heart. That fla&s;hed full upon me, the impropriety of my &s;ituation. Can there be, &s;ay, Chevalier, can there be, any expedient which will free me from reflexion, from &s;lander, except that of the veil?</P>
<P>You <HI>lead</HI> the que&s;tion, madam, replied Sir Charles: I but <HI>follow</HI> you. Surely there <HI>can.</HI></P>
<P>You are not angry with me, Chevalier? You do not upbraid me with breach of Articles?</P>
<P>I do <HI>not,</HI> madam, while we only <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> not <HI>re&s;olve.</HI> A&s;&s;ure your&s;elf that <HI>your</HI> tranquillity of mind is one of the principal objects of my daily vows. Say, Lady Clementina, all that is in your heart to &s;ay. Your friend, your brother, hears his &s;i&s;ter with all the ten|derne&s;s of fraternal love.</P>
<P>How &s;oothing! How kind!&mdash;You &s;ay there <HI>is</HI> an|other expedient. What, excepting marriage, is it?</P>
<P>Were it <HI>that,</HI> and that <HI>could</HI> be an acceptable ex|pedient&mdash;We are only <HI>rea&s;oning,</HI> madam; not <HI>re|&s;olving</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Do you, Chevalier, (with a look of impatience;) propo&s;e that to me.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="250">
I do <HI>not,</HI> madam&mdash;I &s;aid we were <HI>rea&s;oning</HI> only&punc;&mdash;But &s;urely you <HI>may</HI> be very happy in the <HI>&s;ingle</HI> Life. You <HI>may</HI> have thought of plans, which, on con&s;ideration, may not plea&s;e you: But it is yet early. Lady Clementina has too much greatne&s;s of mind to permit any-thing that may be &s;aid by male|volent people to effect her. She knows her heart; and has rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with it. Were your for|mer wi&s;hes to take place, will not ill-will and &s;lander follow you into the mo&s;t &s;acred retirements? There are &s;everal tender points to be con&s;idered in your pa&s;t &s;ituation. The&s;e <HI>are</HI> con&s;idered by your parents. They have no view but to your happine&s;s. You and they indeed have different notions of the means. They think marriage with a worthy man of your own faith, would tend to e&s;tabli&s;h it. <HI>You</HI> think a&s;&s;uming the veil the only expedient. This &s;ubject has been much canva&s;&s;ed. They are determined not to urge you: Yet their judgments are not changed. Shall they not be allowed to <HI>wi&s;h?</HI> E&s;pecially when they <HI>urge</HI> not, <HI>&s;peak</HI> not, their wi&s;hes? Your father was ear|ne&s;t with the count of Belvedere, in my hearing, when la&s;t in town, to give up all expectations from you. God pre&s;erve their lives till they &s;ee you happy! You mu&s;t be convinced, that they are not &s;o intent upon the <HI>means</HI> as to obtain the <HI>end.</HI></P>
<P>My father, my mother, are all goodne&s;s!&mdash;God pre&s;erve their precious lives!&mdash;Tears trickled down her cheeks.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure, my dear Lady Clementina, <HI>you</HI> cannot be happy in <HI>any</HI> &s;tate of life, if your choice, pur&s;ued, would make your <HI>parent;</HI> unhappy.&mdash;Could Lady Clementina, were &s;he even <HI>profe&s;&s;ed,</HI> dive&s;t her&s;elf of <HI>all</HI> filial, of <HI>all</HI> family regards? Would not that very contemplative life, of which &s;he is at pre&s;ent &s;o fond, make her, when it was too late to retrieve the &s;tep (and with the more regret, perhaps, becau&s;e it <HI>was</HI> too late) carry her thoughts, her affections, with
<PB N="250" REF="251">
greater force, back to parents, if <HI>living,</HI> &s;o de&s;ervedly dear, to brothers &s;o di&s;intere&s;tedly kind, to her; and who have <HI>all</HI> &s;hared &s;o largely in her di&s;tre&s;&s;es?</P>
<P>She &s;ighed. She wept. O Chevalier! was all &s;he &s;aid.</P>
<P>You cannot, madam, live only <HI>to</HI> your&s;elf, <HI>for</HI> your&s;elf: And you may live to your God in the world, perhaps, more efficaciou&s;ly than in the con|vent, with regard to your &s;oul's health, as you have &s;uch large ability to do good: For, wants not the world, as I have heretofore pleaded, &s;uch an example as you can give it?&mdash;The <HI>heart,</HI> madam, not the <HI>profe&s;&s;ion</HI> is the truly acceptable. Your maternal grandfather, tho' a &s;ound Catholic, would have it, that there were many &s;ighing hearts in convents; and on this &s;uppo&s;ition (confirmed to him by a &s;ingu|lar in&s;tance which affected him) he in&s;erted in his will the clau&s;es which he thought would <HI>oblige</HI> you to mar|ry. Your other grandfather joined in the enforcement of them.</P>
<P>And what, Sir, was the penalty? Only the forfei|ture of an e&s;tate, which I wi&s;h not for; which none of us want. We are all rich. It is a <HI>purcha&s;ed,</HI> not a <HI>paternal</HI> e&s;tate.</P>
<P>And purcha&s;ed with what view, madam? And for whom?</P>
<P>I would have my family &s;uperior to &s;uch motives.</P>
<P>Mu&s;t they not, my dear Clementina, be judges for them&s;elves?</P>
<P>I do not <HI>believe,</HI> proceeded &s;he, that there <HI>are</HI> ma|ny &s;ighing hearts in convents: But if there <HI>were,</HI> and my friends would be &s;atisfied (for that, I own, is an e&s;&s;ential point with me) <HI>I</HI> &s;hould not, I am <HI>&s;ure,</HI> add to the number of &s;uch. As to what you &s;ay of the world wanting &s;uch an example as I could &s;et it, I have not vanity enough to be convinced by that ar|gument. Whether my &s;oul's peace could be <HI>be&s;t</HI> promoted in the world, or in the convent, mu&s;t be
<PB N="251" REF="252">
left to <HI>me</HI> to judge; who know that in the turmoils and di&s;turbances I have met with, both of mind and body, the retired, the &s;eque&s;tered life, is mo&s;t likely to recompo&s;e my &s;hattered &s;pirits.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e turmoils, tho&s;e di&s;turbances, madam, thank God! are over.</P>
<P>I pity, I can forgive, I <HI>do</HI> forgive, the poor Lau|rana. Ah Sir! you know not, perhaps, that LOVE, a pa&s;&s;ion which is often the cau&s;e of guilty meanne&s;s, as &s;ometimes indeed of laudable greatne&s;s, was the &s;ecret cau&s;e of Laurana's cruelty to me. She hated me not, till that pa&s;&s;ion invaded her bo&s;om. Shall I remember the evil of her behaviour, and not the good?</P>
<P>Admirable Clementina! &s;aid Sir Charles: Admi|rable lady! &s;aid his Harriet; both in a breath.</P>
<P>She was the companion of my childhood, proceeded the exalted Lady. We had our education together. I was the <HI>&s;ufferer;</HI> thank God! not the <HI>aggre&s;&s;or.</HI> She has made me great, by putting it in my power to <HI>for|give</HI> her. Let all my revenge be in her compunction from my forgivene&s;s, and from my wi&s;hes to promote her welfare!</P>
<P>And a revenge indeed would that be, &s;aid Sir Charles, were &s;he, who had acted by an excellent creature, as &s;he has done by you, capable of gene|rous compunction. But, noble&s;t of women, can it be expected, if <HI>you</HI> can forgive her, that your family &s;hould join, by giving up their rever&s;ionary expec|tance, to <HI>reward</HI> her for her cruelty to their child, who was entru&s;ted to her kinde&s;t care and protec|tion? Can you, madam, treat lightly tho&s;e in&s;tances of your parents and brother's Love, which have made them re&s;ent her barbarity to you?&mdash;My dear Lady Clementina, you mu&s;t not aim at being <HI>above</HI> Na|ture. Remember that your grandfather never <HI>de|&s;igned</HI> this e&s;tate for Laurana. It was only to be provi&s;ionally hers, in order to &s;ecure it the more ef|fectually
<PB N="252" REF="253">
to you; and, on failure of de&s;cendants from you, to your elder brother, who, however, wi&s;hes not for it. His heart is in your marriage. He only wi&s;hes, that it may not be the cruel Laurana's. If you can defeat the de&s;ign of your grandfathers, with regard to your <HI>own</HI> intere&s;t, ought you to do inju&s;tice to your brother's claim?</P>
<P>O Chevalier!</P>
<P>Ought you think of di&s;po&s;ing of your brother's right? Has not he much better rea&s;on to be con&s;idered by you for his affection, than Laurana has for her cru|elty?&mdash;Abhorred be that &s;ort of LOVE, my dear Lady Clementina, which is pleaded in excu&s;e of bar|barity, or of any extravagant, undutiful, or unnatural action!</P>
<P>She &s;ighed. Tears again &s;tole down her cheeks. After a &s;hort &s;ilence&mdash;O &s;pare me, Chevalier!&mdash;De&s;pi&s;e me not, Lady Grandi&s;on!&mdash;My enfeebled rea&s;on may lead me into error; but when I know it is error, I will not continue in it. I &s;ee that, with regard to my brother's intere&s;t in this e&s;tate, I rea|&s;oned wrong. I was guilty, my dear Lady Grandi|&s;on, I doubt, in your eye, of a fal&s;e piece of heroi&s;m. I was for doing <HI>le&s;s</HI> than ju&s;tice to a brother, that I might do <HI>more</HI> than ju&s;tice to an unnatural relation.</P>
<P>All that Laurana can hope from you, my dear Lady Clementina, &s;aid Sir Charles, is, that you will intitle her to the receipt of the con&s;iderable legacy your grand|father bequeathed to her&mdash;</P>
<P>And how is that to be done, interrupted &s;he, but by my marriage?&mdash;Ah, Chevalier!</P>
<P>Such, indeed, is the &s;tate of the ca&s;e. Such was it <HI>de&s;igned</HI> to be. I, madam, but &s;tate it. I advi&s;e no|thing.</P>
<P>Still, Sir, the motive which may allowably have weight with my friends, ought not to have principal weight with me. Con&s;ider, Sir: Is it not &s;etting an earthly e&s;tate again&s;t my immortal &s;oul?</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="254">
Far otherwi&s;e, madam. Can you &s;o far doubt of the divine grace, can you &s;o di&s;parage your own virtues, as to &s;uppo&s;e they want the &s;ecurity of a convent? Do ju&s;tice, my dear Lady Clementina, to your&s;elf. You have virtues which cannot be exerted in a convent; and you have <HI>means</HI> to di&s;play them for the good of hundreds. I argue not as a prote|&s;tant, when I addre&s;s my&s;elf to you. The mo&s;t zea|lous catholic, if unprejudiced, <HI>circum&s;tanced as you are,</HI> mu&s;t allow of what I &s;ay.</P>
<P>Ah, Chevalier! how you anticipate me! I was go|ing to charge you with arguing like a prote&s;tant.</P>
<P>Did not your grandfathers, madam, in <HI>effect,</HI> argue as I argue, when they made their wills? Did not your father, mother, uncle, brothers, thus argue, when they wi&s;hed you to relinqui&s;h all thoughts of the veil? And are not the one, were not the others, all zealous catholics? Does not your brother the bi|&s;hop, does not your truly pious confe&s;&s;or, acquie&s;ce in their rea&s;onings, and concur with (at lea&s;t not <HI>oppo&s;e)</HI> the family-rea&s;ons?</P>
<P>She looked down, &s;weetly con&s;cious. Sir Charles proceeded.</P>
<P>Has not your mother, madam, who gave you and your three brothers to the world, a <HI>merit</HI> both with God and man, one of you dedicated, as he is, to God (you &s;ee, madam, I addre&s;s my&s;elf to you in the catholic &s;tile) which the cloi&s;tered life could not have given her? Are not the conjugal and maternal duties (performed as &s;he has performed them) of higher ac|count, than any of tho&s;e can be, which may be ex|erted in the &s;eque&s;tred life? Clementina would not wi&s;h to be a better woman <HI>in the convent,</HI> than her mother has always been <HI>out of it.</HI></P>
<P>She he&s;itated, &s;ighed, looked down: At la&s;t, What can I &s;ay? &s;aid &s;he. I have &s;igned to the waving of my wi&s;hes after the veil; and mu&s;t, I &s;ee, abide by my &s;igning. It is, however, generous in you, Sir, not
<PB N="254" REF="255">
to plead again&s;t me <HI>that</HI> my act; and to hear me with patience want to be ab&s;olved from it. But I am <HI>not</HI> happy&mdash;She &s;topt; and turned away her face to con|ceal her emotion.</P>
<P>Sir Charles was affected&punc; as well as I.</P>
<P>She recovered her &s;peech. I am, at times, &s;aid &s;he, too &s;en&s;ible of running into flight and ab&s;urdity. My late unhappy malady has weakened my rea&s;oning pow|ers. You both <HI>can,</HI> I &s;ee you both <HI>do,</HI> pity me. Let me &s;ay, Chevalier, that when I came into your propo&s;ed compromi&s;e (which, after &s;o grievous a fault com|mitted, as the flying from my native country, and in|dulgent parents, I could the le&s;s refu&s;e) I promi&s;ed my&s;elf happine&s;s in a &s;ituation, in which, I <HI>now</HI> &s;ee, it is not to be found. Your friend&s;hip, your united friend&s;hip for me, happy pair! I thought (as I knew I de&s;erved it by my di&s;intere&s;ted affection for you both) would contribute to it; I was therefore de&s;irous to cul|tivate it. My wounded rea&s;on allowed me not to con&s;ider, that there were improprieties in my &s;cheme, of which the world would judge otherwi&s;e, than I did: And when I heard of vile and unde&s;erved re|flexions ca&s;t upon me; but mo&s;t when that &s;udden indi&s;po&s;ition &s;eized you, my dear Lady Grandi&s;on, and &s;eemed to my frighted imagination to threaten a life &s;o precious&mdash;</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed: Then proceeded.&mdash;I have told you, madam, my reflexions.&mdash;Before you, Chevalier, I have &s;aid enough.&mdash;And now advi&s;e me what to do.&mdash;To &s;ay truth, I almo&s;t as much long to quit Eng|land, as I did to fly to it. I am unhappy. O my fluctuating heart! When, when, &s;hall I be &s;ettled?</P>
<P>What, madam, can I &s;ay? an&s;wered Sir Charles: What can I advi&s;e? You &s;ay you are not happy. You think your parents are not &s;o. We all believe you can make them &s;o. But God forbid it &s;hould be to your own unhappine&s;s, who have already been &s;o great a &s;ufferer, tho' hardly a greater than every one
<PB N="255" REF="256">
of your friends has been from your &s;ufferings. I plead not madam, the cau&s;e of any one man. I have told you, that your father him&s;elf advi&s;es a certain noble|man to give over all hopes of you: And that per&s;on him&s;elf &s;ays, that he will endeavour to do &s;o; fir&s;t, becau&s;e he promi&s;ed you, that he would; and next, becau&s;e he is now too well a&s;&s;ured, that you have an aver&s;ion to him.</P>
<P>An aver&s;ion, Chevalier! God forbid that I &s;hould have an aver&s;ion to any hum n creature! I thought my behaviour to that Gentleman had been &s;uch&mdash;She &s;topt.</P>
<P>It was great; it was worthy of Clementina. But this is his apprehen&s;ion: And if it be ju&s;t, God for|bid that Lady Clementina &s;hould think of him!</P>
<P>My dear Lady Grandi&s;on, do <HI>you</HI> advi&s;e me upon all that has pa&s;&s;ed in this conference. You a&s;&s;ured me at the beginning of it, that my peace of mind was nece&s;&s;ary to your happine&s;s.</P>
<P>From my affection for you, my dear Lady Clemen|tina, and from my affection <HI>only,</HI> it <HI>is</HI> nece&s;&s;ary. You cannot have a di&s;tre&s;s, which will not, if I know it, be a di&s;tre&s;s to me. You know be&s;t what you can do. God give you happine&s;s, and make yours the foundation of that of your indulgent parents! They are of opinion, that a &s;ettled life with &s;ome worthy man of your own country and faith, will greatly contribute to it. Your mamma is firmly of opinion it will: So is Mrs. Beaumont. You &s;ee that you cannot, in ju&s;tice to your brother, and to his chil|dren yet unborn, as well as in duty to your decea&s;ed grandfathers, a&s;&s;ume the veil: You &s;ee that the un|natural Laurana, whom you &s;till are &s;o <HI>great</HI> as to love, cannot enjoy a con&s;iderable legacy bequeathed her, but on your marriage.&mdash;If you have a <HI>di&s;like</HI> to the nobleman who has &s;o large a &s;hare in the affec|tions of all your family, by no means think of him. Rejoice, madam, in a &s;ingle life, if you think you can
<PB N="256" REF="257">
be happy in it, till &s;ome man offer whom you can fa|vour with your e&s;teem. Let <HI>me</HI> be honoured mean time with the continuance of your Love, as I &s;hall be found to de&s;erve it. We are already &s;i&s;ters. In pre|&s;ence, we will be one; in ab&s;ence, we will not be divided; for we will mingle &s;ouls and &s;entiments on paper.&mdash;</P>
<P>I was proceeding; but &s;he wrapt her arms about my neck. She bathed my cheek with her tears.&mdash;O how generou&s;ly did &s;he extol me! how delighted, how affected, was the deare&s;t of men! how delicate was his behaviour to both! the <HI>tender friend</HI> in her, the <HI>beleved wife,</HI> were with the nice&s;t propriety, di&s;|tingui&s;hed by him.</P>
<P>The dear Lady was too much di&s;ordered by her own grateful rapture, to recover a train of rea&s;oning. She told me, however, that &s;he would ponder, weigh, con|&s;ider every thing that had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>God give her happine&s;s! prays with her whole heart,</P>

<P>LADY Clementina is thoughtful, &s;olemn, and &s;huns company. Not one word will any|body &s;ay to her of the Count of Belvedere: But as he is expected here every-day to take his leave, Sir Charles thinks &s;he ought not to be &s;urprized by his coming at unawares. She neither dined nor &s;upped in company ye&s;terday; nor breakfa&s;ted with us this morning. She loves, as you have heard, to walk in the garden.

He has always been of opinion with the phy&s;icians of Italy, that a di&s;order of mind not here|ditary, but circum&s;tanced as Lady Clementina's was, will be in no danger of returning, or of becoming he|reditary, unle&s;s on &s;ome new di&s;tre&s;s like the former. He expre&s;&s;ed his wonder more than once. at her re|lations acquie&s;cence with her plea, as &s;he made <HI>that</HI> the principal again&s;t marriage; tho' he allowed it to be a noble and generous one in her. And now, in or|der to ju&s;tify his opinion, he has taken, of his own accord, the opinions of the mo&s;t noted London phy|&s;icians: who entirely agree with him.</P>

<P>LADY Clementina has been generou&s;ly lamenting to me the unhappine&s;s of the cruel Laurana. What I hinted to Sir Charles, &s;aid &s;he, of her Love for the Count of Belvedere, is but too true. I have been urged to have compa&s;&s;ion, as it is called, on <HI>him.</HI> He &s;hould have &s;hewed &s;ome for <HI>her.</HI> She was propo&s;ed to him. He rejected the propo&s;al with haughtine&s;s: But, I believe, knew not how much &s;he loved him. I have faint remembrances of her ravings, as I may call them, for him, to her mother and woman: Sometimes vowing revenge for &s;lighted Love&mdash;Poor Laurana was another Olivia in the violence of her pa&s;|&s;ion.
<PB N="258" REF="259">
In the few lucid intervals I had when I was under her management. I always expected that the&s;e ravings would end in harder u&s;age of me. Yet even then, when I had calmne&s;s enough to pity my&s;elf, I pitied her. O that the Count would make her happy, and could think him&s;elf happy in her!&mdash;</P>
<P>She a&s;ked me if Sir Charles were not indeed inclined to favour the Count?</P>
<P>He wi&s;hes you, madam, to marry, an&s;wered I, be|cau&s;e he thinks (and phy&s;icians of Italy and England, and Mr. Lowther, concur with your parents wi&s;hes) if there were a man in the world whom you could con&s;ent to make happy, the con&s;equence would not only make your whole family &s;o, but your&s;elf. But the choice of the <HI>man,</HI> he thinks, &s;hould be entirely left to you: He thinks that the count, &s;o often refu&s;ed, ought not to be in&s;i&s;ted on; and that time &s;hould be given you.</P>
<P>Let me a&s;k you, Lady Grandi&s;on, as one &s;i&s;ter to another, Could <HI>you,</HI> in <HI>my</HI> &s;ituation, have re&s;olved to give your hand&mdash;She &s;topt, blu&s;hed, looked down. I &s;natched her hand, and lifted it to my lips&mdash;Speak your whole Heart, my Clementina, to your Harriet.&mdash;But yet I will &s;pare you, when I under&s;tand your meaning. Noble&s;t of women, <HI>I</HI> am not Clementina. <HI>I</HI> could not, &s;ituated as you once were, all my friends con&s;enting, and the man&mdash;&s;uch as you knew him to be, have refu&s;ed him my hands as well as heart. But what may not be expected from a Lady, who, from a re|gard to her &s;uperior duties could make the mo&s;t laud|able pa&s;&s;ion of inferior force?&mdash;You have already overcome the greate&s;t difficulty; and when you can per&s;uade your&s;elf that it is your <HI>duty</HI> to enter into new&punc; mea&s;ures, I am &s;ure, whatever they may be.&mdash;</P>
<P>Dear Lady Grandi&s;on, &s;ay no more&mdash;My duty&mdash;How delicate are your intimations!&mdash;What a &s;ubject have we &s;lid into!&mdash;Believe me, I am incapable&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="260">
Of any thought, of any imagination, interrupted I, that an angel might not own. It would be an injury to your Harriet's emulative Love of you, were you but to &s;uppo&s;e any a&s;&s;urances of your greatne&s;s of mind nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>But I am at times pained, generous Lady Gran|di&s;on, for what <HI>your</HI> friends may think, may wi&s;h&mdash;O that I were in my own country again!</P>
<P>They wi&s;h for nothing but your happine&s;s. Lay down your own Plan, dear Lady: Chalk out your future &s;teps. Look about you, one, two, three years, in the &s;ingle life: A&s;&s;ure your indulgent parents&mdash;</P>
<P>Hu&s;h, hu&s;h, hu&s;h, hu&s;h, my dear Lady Grandi&s;on, gently putting her hand on my Mouth: I will, I mu&s;t, leave you!&mdash;O my fluctuating heart!&mdash;But what|ever I &s;hall be enabled to do; who&s;e-&s;oever di&s;plea|&s;ure I may incur, do <HI>you</HI> continue to love me; &s;till call me Si&s;ter; and, through you, let me call Sir Charles Grandi&s;on my Brother; and then &s;hall I have a felicity that will counter balance many infe|licities.</P>
<P>She hurried from me, not &s;taying to hear the affec|tionate a&s;&s;urances of my admiring Love, that were bur&s;ting my lips from a heart fervently de&s;iring to comply with every wi&s;h of hers.</P>

<P>THE Marquis is &s;lightly indi&s;po&s;ed. The Mar|chione&s;s is not well. Lady Clementina applying to Mrs. Beaumont for con&s;olation on the occa&s;ion, owned, that were their indi&s;po&s;itions to gather &s;trength, &s;he &s;hould be too ready for her peace of mind, to charge them to her own account.

<P>WELL, but now, I Charlotte G. who have taken up Harriet's pen, &s;ay, the&s;e tears will &s;oon be dried up. The Marquis and his Lady are both better. The Count is arrived; Signors Juliano and Seba&s;ti|ano with him. Did you not &s;ee the Count when he was in town, Lucy? A pretty man, upon my life, were he not quite &s;o &s;olemn: But that very &s;olemnity will make for him with the fair romancer; Is he not come, as Lee &s;ays, in his Theodo&s;ius,</P>

<L>&mdash;"To take eternal leave?</L>
<L>"Not to vouch&s;afe to &s;ee him, would be &s;corn,</L>
<L>"Which the fair &s;oul of gentle CLEMENTINA</L>
<L>"Could never harbour."</L>
</LG>
<P>Accordingly, on his arrival, not un&s;ent to, but al|mo&s;t unnexpected, down &s;he came to tea; and with <HI>&s;uch</HI> a grace!&mdash;Indeed, my dear and venerable Mrs. Shirley, &s;he will be a good Girl. All will come right. She was a little &s;olemn indeed in her &s;erenity: But &s;he plainly put her&s;elf forward to &s;peak. She &s;eemed to pity the Count's confu&s;ion (who, poor &s;oul! knew not how to &s;peak to her) and relieved it by enquiring after his health, as he had not been well. She ad|dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to him once or twice on indifferent &s;ub|jects; and plea&s;ed every-body by her behaviour to him. Nay, they talked together a good while at the window, he, and &s;he, and Mrs. Beaumont, very free|ly about England and Italy, comparing in a few in|&s;tances, the&s;e gardens with tho&s;e of the Marquis at Bologna. No very intere&s;ting conver&s;ation indeed; but the good Count thought him&s;elf in paradi&s;e. Yet he fears he &s;hall to-morrow be allowed to take a long, long leave of her. He goes to France and Italy; not

to Spain. I like him for that, it would only be di|&s;tre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf, further, he &s;ays, were he to amu&s;e a worthy family who have invited him thither with a view that can never be an&s;wered, while Clementina remains unmarried.</P>
<P>My brother continues to in&s;i&s;t upon it, that not one word &s;hall be &s;aid in the Count's favour Sea|room, and Land-room, Mrs. Shirely, as I &s;aid once before&mdash;Where did he learn &s;o throughly to under|&s;tand the perver&s;ene&s;s of a female Heart?</P>

<P>AND &s;o, Lucy, your day is fixed. May next Thur&s;day be a happy one, and reward the he|roic girl who &s;o nobly conquered a fir&s;t Love, on the di&s;covered unworthine&s;s of the man.

tho' I name that creature my&s;elf, never do you pre|&s;ume to do it. I blu&s;h even to this hour at looking back to certain giddine&s;&s;es that deba&s;ed my character&mdash;But let me quit a &s;ubject &s;o di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>Lady Clementina has had a bad night&punc; it &s;eems&mdash;Came not down to breakfa&s;t. The poor Enamo|re to was in de&s;pair. I tried to hearten him up a little: But my brother will not let any body flatter him with a hope that too probably may end in di&s;|appointment.</P>
<P>Yonder [I am writing at my window, you mu&s;t know] is the fair Inflexible mu&s;ing in the garden. I have a good mind to call to her; for I &s;ee by her motions and downca&s;t looks, that Re&s;verie is no fa|vourable &s;ign for the Count&mdash;No need of my calling to her; my Prother has this minute joined her. As &s;oon as he came in &s;ight, &s;he went to him.&mdash;Now, dear brother, put in a word for the poor man.</P>
<P>Well, but Lucy, this Lord of yours mu&s;t come among us. He &s;nall not carry you to Ireland this year. Let all who would be good hu&s;bands and good wives, come to Grandi&s;on-hall, and learn: And, pray, let them come while <HI>I am here.</HI> Yet I have &s;omething to &s;ay again&s;t our Harriet too.&mdash;She is &s;o taken up with her heroic friend&s;hip, that Clemen|tina is now almo&s;t the only &s;ubject of her pen. What godlike in&s;tances of my brother's goodne&s;s does &s;he leave untold tho' &s;he admires him for them, as much as ever! Every ri&s;ing, every &s;etting fun, are witne&s;&s;es of his divine Philanthropy. I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he looks upon his prai&s;es now to be her own. Well &s;he may. Never were hearts &s;o united, &s;o formed for one ano|ther. But Harriet u&s;ed to prai&s;e her&s;elf formerly; Did &s;he not, uncle Selby?</P>
<P>Believe me, I will prai&s;e my hone&s;t man when|ever he gives me cau&s;e. For in&s;tance; Ye&s;terday, I was well enough plea&s;ed with what he &s;aid to my

brother.&mdash;You, Sir Charles, ought not to give your|&s;elf up to a private life. Your country has a claim upon &s;uch a character as yours.</P>
<P>Without doubt, &s;aid I&mdash;Shall we, my-Lord, make my brother an emba&s;&s;ador, or a ju&s;tice of peace? Lord G. rubbed his forehead; but &s;eeing me &s;mile, his countenance brightened up. Don't you know, Charlotte, &s;aid my brother, that nothing but the engagements our noble gue&s;ts have given me, would have prevented me from acting in the u&s;eful cha|racter you have la&s;t named?</P>
<P>O that you had, brother! What admirable cau&s;es would then have been brought before US, <HI>en dernier re&s;&s;ort!</HI> How delightfully would your time have been taken up with the appeals of &s;colding wives, for&s;aken dam&s;els, and witches pre&s;umptive!</P>
<P>L dy G. <HI>mo&s;t</HI> be her&s;elf, whatever be the &s;ubject, replied Sir Charles. You and I love her, my Lord, for her charming vivacity. But think you, my &s;i&s;ter, that a day &s;pent in doing good, be the objects of it ever &s;o low, is not more plea&s;ing to reflect upon&punc; than a day of the mo&s;t elegant indulgence? Would per|&s;ons of &s;en&s;e and di&s;tinction (my&s;elf out of the que|&s;tion) more frequently than they do, undertake the task, it would be lighter to every one, and would keep the great power ve&s;ted in this cla&s;s of magi&s;trates, and which is every year increa&s;ing, out of mean and mercenary hands. And, &s;urely, men of con&s;idera|tion in the world owe it to their tenants and neigh|bours, and to tho&s;e of their fellow-creatures to who&s;e indu&s;try they are obliged for their affluence, to em|ploy in their &s;ervice, tho&s;e advantages of rank and education, which make it perhaps ea&s;y for them to clear up and adju&s;t, in half an hour, matters that would be of endle&s;s perplexity and entanglement to the parties concerned.</P>
<P>Mind this, uncle Selby; for I think you are too fond of your own ways and your own ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rs, to do your duty as an active ju&s;tice, tho' of the quorum.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="265">
But I &s;hould have told you, Lucy, how this con|ver&s;ation began. I got the occa&s;ion for it out of Dr. Bartlett af erwards. You mu&s;t know, that I vi&s;it him now and then as Harriet u&s;ed to do, to learn &s;ome of my brother's good deeds, that otherwi&s;e would not come to our knowledge; by which I un|der&s;tand that notwith&s;tanding he gives his gue&s;ts &s;o much of his company, and appears &s;o ea&s;y and free among us, yet, that every beneficent &s;cheme is going on: Not one improvement &s;tands &s;till: He knows not what it is to be one moment idle.</P>
<P>Dr. Bartlett tells me, that &s;ome gentlemen of prime con&s;ideration in the county, have been offering my brother their intere&s;t again&s;t the next election. He mode&s;tly acknowleged the grateful &s;en&s;e he had of the honour done him; but declined it for the pre+&s;ent, as having been too little a while returned into his own country, after &s;o long an ab&s;ence, to be as yet fit for a tru&s;t &s;o important. We young men, &s;aid he, are apt to be warm: When we have not &s;tudied a point throughly, we act upon ha&s;ty con|clu&s;ions, and &s;ometimes &s;upport, &s;ometimes oppo&s;e, on in&s;ufficient grounds. I would not be under <HI>Engagements</HI> to any party: Neither can I think of contributing to de&s;troy the morals and health of all the country people round me, to make my&s;elf what is called an <HI>Intere&s;t.</HI> Forgive me, gentlemen: I mean not to &s;light your favours: But on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, I ought to be explicit.</P>
<P>But, after the gentlemen were gone. There is a county, Dr. Bartlett, &s;aid he, of which I &s;hould be ambitious to be one of the repre&s;entatives, had I a <HI>na|tural</HI> intere&s;t in it; becau&s;e of the reverence I bear to the good man, to whom in that ca&s;e I &s;hould have the honour to call my&s;elf a collegue. When I can think my&s;elf more worthy than at pre&s;ent I am, of &s;tanding in &s;uch a civil relation to him, I &s;hall con|&s;ider him, as another Gamaliel, at who&s;e feet (&s;o
<PB N="265" REF="266">
long ab&s;ent as I have been from my native country) I &s;hall be proud to be initiated into the &s;ervice of the public.</P>
<P>It is not difficult to gue&s;s, who my brother&mdash;But my Marmou&s;et is &s;qualling for me; and I mu&s;t fly to &s;ilence it.</P>
<P>Now, Lucy, that I have pacified my Brat, do I wi&s;h you with me at my window. My Brother and his Harriet only, at this in&s;tant walking almo&s;t under it, engaged in earne&s;t conver&s;ation: Seem|ingly, how plea&s;ing a one! admiration and tender|ne&s;s mingled in <HI>his</HI> looks: In <HI>her,</HI> while he &s;peaks, the mo&s;t delighted attention: When &s;he an&s;wers, love, affiance, mode&s;t deference, benevolence, com|pa&s;&s;ion; an expre&s;&s;ion that no pen can de&s;cribe&mdash;Knowing them both &s;o well, and acquainted with their u&s;ual behaviour to each other, I can make it all out. She is pleading, I am &s;ure, for Clementina. Charming pleader!&mdash;Yet, my dear Mrs. Shirley, I fear her rea&s;onings are romantic ones. Our Harriet, you know, was always a little tinctured with Hero|i&s;m; and &s;he goes back in her mind to the time that &s;he thought &s;he could never be the wife of any other man than my brother (tho' then hopele&s;s that he could be hers); and &s;uppo&s;es Clementina in the &s;ame &s;ituation.</P>
<P>When I looked fir&s;t, I dare &s;ay, he was giving her an account of the conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed an hour ago, between him and Clementina. He had his arm round her wai&s;t, &s;ometimes pre&s;&s;ing her to him as they walked; &s;ometimes &s;tanding &s;till; and, on her replies, rai&s;ing her hand to his lips, with &s;uch <HI>tender</HI> po&s;&s;ion&mdash;But here &s;he comes.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>YOU need not be told, my dear Lucy, that our charming Lady G. is mi&s;tre&s;s of penetration. Your happy Harriet had been engaged in the mo&s;t plea&s;ing conver&s;ation. The be&s;t of hu&s;bands con|ceals not from her one emotion of his excellent heart. He is greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for Clementina. It would be unworthy of his character, if he were not: Yet he &s;eems to think &s;he may be happy with the Count of Belvedere: That is the point we have been debating. As Sir Charles would have been the man of her choice, but for an invincible ob&s;tacle, is it not ow|ing, partly to his delicate mode&s;ty, that he thinks &s;he may be &s;o? What think you, Lucy?</P>
<P>Lady G. &s;ays, I make Clementina's ca&s;e my own. Be it &s;o; becau&s;e <HI>&s;o</HI> it <HI>ought</HI> to be. Could I have been happy with Lord D?&mdash;Call it romantic, if you plea&s;e, Lady G.; I think it impo&s;&s;ible that I <HI>could,</HI> even tho' I could not form to my&s;elf, that Sir Charles Grandi&s;on him&s;elf would make the tender, the indul|gent hu&s;band he makes to the happie&s;t of women.</P>
<P>Sir Charles gave me the particulars of the conver|&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed between him and Lady Clementina in the garden. He ob&s;erved, that &s;he is not a &s;tran|ger to the Count's re&s;olution, never to marry while <HI>&s;he</HI> remains unmarried; and that it is the intention of that nobleman to return to Italy, and not go to Spain at all. Perhaps &s;he had her information either from Camilla or Laura; who both heard him declare as much. If &s;he has conde&s;cended to hear <HI>them</HI> talk on a &s;ubject which every body el&s;e has &s;tudiou&s;ly avoid|ed, &s;he may al&s;o have heard from them many other particulars greatly to the Count's honour; for they are his admirers and well-wi&s;hers.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="268">
Sir Charles believes &s;he will take a gracious leave of the Count before he &s;ets out.</P>
<P>The &s;olemn, the parting interview, was to have been in my drawing-room this afternoon: But Lady Clementina has given the Count an unexpected, and joyful reprieve.</P>
<P>She dined in company. We were all charmed with her free and ea&s;y deportment, as well to the Count, as to every-body el&s;e. <HI>His</HI> was not &s;o ea&s;y. He, intending to be&s;peak the favour of half an hour's audience of her, in order to take leave of her, when &s;he aro&s;e from table, was in vi&s;ible agitations. How the poor man trembled! with what awe, with what reverence, as he &s;at, did he glance towards her! How did every-body pity him, and by their eyes be|&s;eech her pity for him! yet, in the &s;ame moment, our eyes fell under hers, as &s;he looked upon each per&s;on; we all &s;eeming unwilling to have her think we entreated for him by them. I thought I read in her lovely countenance more than once, compa&s;&s;ion for him; yet, the breath hard-fetched, <HI>as</HI> often &s;hew|ed a &s;igh &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, that indicated, I imagined, a <HI>wi&s;h</HI> (al&s;o &s;uppre&s;&s;ed) after a life more eligible to her than the nuptial.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, when we women aro&s;e from table, he, as a man who mu&s;t addre&s;s her in ha&s;te, or be unable at all to do it, &s;lept towards her; retreated, when near her, as irre&s;olute; and again advancing, pro|foundly bowing, Madam, madam, &s;aid he, he&s;itat|ingly&mdash;putting out his hand, as if he would have taken hers; but withdrawing it ha&s;tily, before he touched it&mdash;I hope&mdash;I beg&mdash;allow me&mdash;I be&s;eech you&mdash;one parting moment.</P>

with &s;ome little precipitation; but with a dignity that never for&s;akes her.</P>

<P>I have a Letter from Emily. I inclo&s;e it, with a copy of my an&s;wer. I hope it is not a breach of con|fidence to communicate them both to you, and thro' you, madam, to my aunt Selby. At pre&s;ent I wi&s;h the contents may be a &s;ecret to every-body el&s;e.</P>
<P>Don't let Lucy repine at her di&s;tant re&s;idence, if it mu&s;t be in Ireland. It is generally the privilege of hu&s;bands to draw their wives after them.

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Sat. May <HI>19.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Have &s;omething to communicate to you, my dear Lady Grandi&s;on, and take your advice about: yet, &s;o young a creature as I am, I am <HI>quite</HI> a&s;hamed. But you mu&s;t keep my &s;ecret from every living &s;oul, and from my guardian too, for the pre&s;ent, &s;ince in writ|ing to you, I think I write to him, as you know all his heart, and are &s;o prudent a Lady. It is true, I was, (or I might have been, I &s;hould rather &s;ay) a for|ward girl with regard to him: But then my whole heart was captivated by his perfections, by his great|ne&s;s of <HI>mind;</HI> that was all. May not a creature, tho' ever &s;o young, admire a good man's goodne&s;s? May &s;he not have a deep &s;en&s;e of gratitude for kind|ne&s;s conferred? That gratitude may indeed, as &s;he grows up, engage her too deeply; and <HI>I</HI> found my|&s;elf in danger; but made my e&s;cape in time. Thank God!&mdash;and thank you, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted me!&mdash;what an excellent Lady are you, that one can &s;peak to you of the&s;e tender matters! But you are the Queen of our Sex, and &s;it inthroned, holding out your &s;cep|ter in pity to one poor girl, and rai&s;ing another, and another; for it is glory enough for you to call the man yours, for whom &s;o many hearts have &s;ighed in &s;ecret.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="271">
But this was always my way&mdash;I never &s;at my|&s;elf down to write to my guardian or to you, but my preambles were longer than my matter&mdash;To the point then&mdash;but <HI>be &s;ure</HI> keep my &s;ecret.</P>
<P>Here every-body is fond of Sir Edward Beau|champ. He is indeed a very agreeable man. Next to my guardian, I think him the mo&s;t agreeable of men. He is always coming down to us. I cannot but &s;ee that he is particularly obliging to me. I really believe, young as I am, he loves me: But every body is &s;o <HI>&s;ilent</HI> about him: yet they &s;lide away, and leave us together very o&s;ten. It looks as if all favoured him; yet would not interfere. He has not made any declaration of love neither.&mdash;I am &s;o <HI>young</HI> a creature, you know; and to be &s;ure he is a very prudent man.</P>
<P>My guardian dearly loves him&mdash;who does not? His addre&s;s is <HI>&s;o</HI> gentle: His words are <HI>&s;o</HI> &s;oothing: His voice&mdash;To be &s;ure he is a very amiable man! Now tell me freely&mdash;Do you think my guardian (but pray only &s;ound him&mdash;I am &s;o young a creature, you know) would be di&s;plea&s;ed if matters were to come to &s;omething in time?&mdash;Three or four years hence, &s;uppo&s;e, if Sir Edward would think it worth while to &s;tay for &s;o &s;illy a creature?&mdash;I would not <HI>think</HI> of &s;ooner.&mdash;If not, I would not allow my&s;elf to be &s;o much in his company, you know.</P>
<P>He has a very good e&s;tate; and tho' he is ten or twelve years older than I; yet he never will be more than that; &s;ince every year that goes over his head, will go over mine likewi&s;e&mdash;So you will be plea&s;ed to give me your opinion.</P>
<P>And here all the world is for marrying, I think. Mi&s;s Selby is as good as gone, you know. Her brother courts Mi&s;s Patty Holles: Mi&s;s Kitty is not without her humble &s;ervant. Nay, Mi&s;s Nancy Sel|by, for that matter&mdash;But let the&s;e intelligences come from them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="272">
You, my dear Lady Grandi&s;on, have led up this dance&mdash;So happy as you are&mdash;I think it is a right thing for young women to marry when young men are &s;o de&s;irous to copy Sir Charles Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>Ha&s;ten to me your advice, if but in &s;ix lines. We expect Sir Edward down next week. I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> like his company, becau&s;e he is always telling us one charming thing or other of my guardian; and becau&s;e he &s;o &s;in|cerely rejoices in your happine&s;s and his.</P>

<P>I HAVE a great opinion of your prudence, my Love: And I have as high a one of Sir Edward Beauchamp's honour and di&s;cretion. His fortune, his merit are unexceptionable. Your guardian loves him. If you could certainly love Sir Edward above all men, and he you above all women, I am of opi|nion your guardian will think no alliance can be hap|pier for both, and for him&s;elf too: For you know, my dear, that your welfare is near his heart. Let me, my &s;weet Emily, refer you as to your conduct on this occa&s;ion, to my own almo&s;t-unerring coun&s;ellors, my grandmamma and aunt Selby. Don't be a&s;hamed to open your heart to them: Are you not under their wings? I will &s;o manage, that they &s;hall lead the way to your freedom with them.

<P>I Begin this Letter, as I ended my la&s;t to Lucy&mdash;May this day be a happy one to her, and then it will be &s;o to us all&mdash;My dear aunt Selby will be &s;o good as to favour me with a line to acquaint me with the actual celebration; that I may ground upon in my earlie&s;t felicitations.</P>
<P>I will proceed with an account of what &s;o much en|gages the attention of every one here.</P>
<P>I told you in one of my former, that Lady G. had &s;hewn to Mrs. Beaumont Lucy's account of the con|ver&s;ation held at Shirley-manor, on the &s;ubject of a fir&s;t Love, with Lady G's &s;prightly deci&s;ion upon it, and upon the appeal made to me.&mdash;I mu&s;t now tell you, that Mrs. Beaumont prevailed upon Lady Cle|mentina to de&s;ire me to read it to her. She made her reque&s;t; and I obeyed. Mrs. Beaumont was pre&s;ent. Not a word by way of application did ei|ther &s;he or I &s;ugge&s;t, when I had done reading. Lady Clementina's complexion often changed as I read. She was not at all diverted with tho&s;e lively parts of Lady G's deci&s;ion, that I ventured to read; tho' &s;he is an admirer of her &s;prightly vein. She looked down mo&s;t of the time in &s;olemn &s;ilence. And at la&s;t, when I had ended, &s;he, &s;ighing, &s;tarted, as if from a re&s;verie, aro&s;e, courte&s;ied, and withdrew; not having once opened her lips on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="274">
THE Bi&s;hop, Signor Jeronymo, and the two young Lords, ju&s;t now joined to reque&s;t Sir Charles to become avowedly an advocate for the Count to Lady Clemen|tina. They urged, that &s;he was ballancing in his fa|vour; and that Sir Charles's weight would turn the &s;cale: But Sir Charles not only de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed, but begged that &s;he might not be &s;olicited by any-body on that &s;ubject&mdash;May &s;he not, a&s;ked he, by rea&s;oning with her&s;elf, and con&s;idering what &s;he can do, with ju&s;tice to the Count and her&s;elf? Her <HI>future</HI> peace of mind is concerned that her determination <HI>now,</HI> &s;hall be all her own. Leave her no room for after-regret, for having been per&s;uaded again&s;t her mind. If per|&s;ua&s;ion only is wanting, will &s;he not wrap her&s;elf up in re&s;erve, to keep her&s;elf in countenance for not hav|ing been per&s;uaded before?</P>
<P>Pur&s;uant to this advice, the Marchione&s;s in a con|ver&s;ation with her beloved daughter, that might have led to the &s;ubject on which their hearts are fixed, de|clined it; &s;aying, Whatever my child &s;hall determine upon, with regard to any plan for her future life, let her whole heart be in it: her choice &s;hall be ours.</P>

<P>LADY Clementina excu&s;ed her&s;elf from breakfa&s;ting with us; but obliged us with her Company at din|ner. At, and after dinner, Sir Charles directed him|&s;elf to all the company, in turn, in his u&s;ual agree|able manner. How does his benign countenance al|ways &s;hine when he finds him&s;elf &s;urrounded at ta|ble by his friends the larger the circle, the more diffu&s;ed is his chearfulne&s;s. With what delight does his Jeronymo meditate his every graceful motion! He dwells upon what he &s;ays, and by his eyes ca&s;t with le&s;s complaceney on an interrupter, &s;eems to wi&s;h every one &s;ilent, when Sir Charles's lips begin to open.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="275">
After he had gone round his ample table, &s;aying &s;omething obliging to all (in a manner <HI>calling</HI> forth e|very one, to &s;ay &s;omething in his or her own way) he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf more particularly to the Count, and led him into &s;ubjects both learned and familiar, in which he knew he <HI>could</HI> &s;hine; and in which he <HI>d d.</HI> It was doubly kind in Sir Charles to do &s;o; for the poor man's reverence for the mi&s;tre&s;s of his fate, had taken all courage from his love, and he <HI>wanted</HI> to be drawn out. Never can ba&s;hful merit appear to &s;o much ad|vantage, as in Sir Charles's addre&s;s to it.</P>
<P>How much &s;oul did Lady Clementina &s;hew in her eyes! &s;he was very attentive to every one that &s;poke. She a&s;ked the Count que&s;tions more than once on &s;ome of the &s;ubjects he was led to talk of. My eyes, as I could feel, gli&s;tened when &s;he did, to &s;ee how tho&s;e of her father and mother rejoiced, as I may &s;ay, on the notice &s;he took of him. Lady Clementina could not but ob&s;erve how delightfully her complai&s;ance to the Count was received by all her family&mdash;Is it po&s;&s;i|ble, thought I, more than once, were I in the &s;itua|tion of this admirable Lady, to avoid obliging &s;uch indulgent parents with the grant of all their wi&s;hes, that depended on my&s;elf; having given up voluntarily the man I preferred to all others?</P>
<P>Signor Seba&s;tiano dropt a hint once, of his own, and the Count's, and Signor Juliano's intention of &s;etting out; mentioning a care for their baggage, which by this time, he &s;uppo&s;ed, had reached Dover: But Clementina turning an attentive ear to what he &s;aid, Sir Charles was afraid &s;he would take this hint as a de&s;ign to ha&s;ten her re&s;olution; and &s;aid, We will not &s;adden our hearts with the thoughts of parting with any of our friends.</P>

<P>THE dear perver&s;e Clementina may be now in|dulged, if &s;he has not from principles of grati|tude already yielded to give her hand to our Belvedere. I hope &s;he <HI>has.</HI> One of our motives for urging her, is at an end. Laurana is no more. Her mother kept from her as long as &s;he could, the news of the Count's accompanying you all to England: But when &s;he was told that he was actually in that kingdom; and that my &s;i&s;ter was heard of; &s;he doubted not but the con|&s;equence would be the defeating of all her hopes with regard to him. A deep melancholy fir&s;t &s;eized her; that was &s;ucceeded by raving fits; and it is &s;u&s;pected that the poor creature, eluding the care of her atten|dants, came to a mi&s;erable end. Lady Sforza is in|con&s;olable. A malignant fever is given out&mdash;&s;o let it pa&s;s&mdash;SHE, whom the wretched creature mo&s;t cruelly u&s;ed, will &s;hed a tear for the companion of her childhood: But who el&s;e, be&s;ides her own mother, will?&mdash;Yet, if the manner of her quitting life were as &s;hocking as it is whi&s;pered to me it was&mdash;But I will not enquire further about it, for fear I &s;hould be in|duced to &s;hew compa&s;&s;ion for a wretch who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> not any to &s;hew to a near relation, entru&s;ted to her care, and who had a right to her kinde&s;t treatment.</P>

She even threatens to &s;teal from her hu&s;band, if he con&s;ent not, and now Clementina has &s;hewn her the way, procure a pa&s;&s;age thither, to try my Love in following her, as that naughty girl has all yours, in a &s;ea&s;on&mdash;But what is the inclemency of &s;ea&s;on, what are winds, mountains, &s;eas, to a woman who has &s;et her heart on an adventure?

<P>I do a&s;&s;ure you, Jeronymo, that I unfeignedly join with you in your joy, that &s;o de&s;erving a man is not a lo&s;er by a di&s;appointment, that we all know &s;at hea|vily upon him, at the time.

<P>UNHAPPY Laurana! Sir Charles expre&s;&s;ed great concern for the manner of her death. How <HI>can</HI> you, brother, &s;aid Lady G. (when we three only were together) be concerned for &s;o execrable a wretch!</P>
<P>Shall a human creature peri&s;h, replied he, and its fellow-creature not be moved? Shall an immortal Being fix its eternal &s;tate by an act dreadful and irre|ver&s;ible; by a crime that admits not of repentance; and &s;hall we not be concerned? this indeed was ow|ing to di&s;traction: But how ill was &s;uch a &s;oul as Laurana's prepared to ru&s;h into Eternity?&mdash;Unhap|py Laurana!</P>
<P>It is not thought fit, for obvious rea&s;ons, to ac|quaint Clementina with the contents of the general's Letter.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t, my dear grandmamma, the great point &s;eems to be decided. Lady Clementina had for &s;ome time been employing her&s;elf in drawing up, in two oppo&s;ite columns, the arguments for and again&s;t her entering into the marriage-&s;tate. She &s;hewed them to me, and afterwards to Mrs Beaumont; but would not allow either of us to take a copy. She has &s;tated them very fairly. I could not but ob&s;erve to her on <HI>which</HI> &s;ide the &s;trength lay.</P>
<P>This morning &s;he gave us her company at break|fa&s;t-time for a few minutes only. She was in vi&s;ible emotions; and &s;eemed de&s;irous of getting the better of them; but was unable; and therefore retired, She &s;hut her&s;elf up, and about noon, &s;ent, &s;ealed up,

a Letter; which I will Engli&s;h as well as I can; thus directed;</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To her ever-honoured, ever-indulgent Father and Mother, <HI>CLEMENTINA DELLA PORRETTA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HOW did my whole Soul a&s;pire after the veil!&mdash;In&s;uperable ob&s;tacles having ari&s;en again&s;t the union of your child with one exalted man, how aver&s;e was I to enter into covenant with any other!</P>
<P>It was your plea&s;ure, my Lord; it was yours, ma|dam; that I &s;hould not be indulged in the a&s;pirati|on. You had the goodne&s;s to oblige me in my aver&s;e|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Chevalier Grandi&s;on has &s;ince convinced me&punc; by generous and conde&s;cending rea&s;onings, that I could not, in duty to the will of my two grandfa|thers, and in ju&s;tice to my elder brother and his de|&s;cendants, renew my wi&s;hes after the cloi&s;ter. I &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>But now, what is to be done; what <HI>can</HI> I do, to make you, my deare&s;t parents, and my brothers, happy? Olivia triumphs over me. My &s;ituation is di&s;agreeable: I, who ought to be a comfort to my friends, have been, I &s;till am, a trouble to them all.&mdash;The Chevalier Grandi&s;on and his excellent Lady, have &s;ignified to me, more than once, that they ex|pect from me the completion of their earthly happi|ne&s;s: And what is this life, but a &s;hort, a tran&s;itory pa&s;&s;age to a better?</P>
<P>Have I not declined accepting the vows of the fir&s;t of men? The only man I ever &s;aw with a wi&s;h to be united to him? Decline them on motives, that all my friends think do me honour?</P>
<P>Have I ever, dear as the &s;truggle co&s;t me, repented the glorious &s;elf denial? And what precedents of &s;elf|denial (wholly yours by laws divine and human, as I am) have you, my ever indulgent parents, &s;et me?</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="280">
Is there a man I would prefer to him whom my friends are &s;olicitous to commend to my favour?</P>
<P>Cannot I, in performing my duty to my parents, perform all tho&s;e duties of life, which performed, may intitle me to a ble&s;&s;ed hope?</P>
<P>Shall I contend in and through life, to carry a point, that at the awful clo&s;e of it will appear to me, as nothing?&mdash;</P>
<P>Let me make a propo&s;al&mdash;On a &s;uppo&s;ition that you, Sir, that you, Madam (who&s;e patient good|ne&s;s to me has been unexampled), and every one of my friends, favour the Count of Belvedere as much as ever&mdash;I have always acknowledged his merits&mdash;</P>
<P>Permit me a year's con&s;ideration from the pre&s;ent time, to examine the &s;tate of my head and heart; and at the end of that year, allow me to determine; and I will endeavour, my dear parents, to make <HI>your</HI> wi&s;hes, and <HI>my</HI> duty, honour, con&s;cience, (di|ve&s;ted of caprice, fancy, petulance) my &s;ole guides in the re&s;ult, as well as in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. The Che|valier Grandi&s;on, his Lady, Father Mare&s;cutti, and Mrs. Beaumont, &s;hall be judges between my rela|tions and me, if there be occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>But, as it would be unrea&s;onable to expect, that the Count of Belvedere &s;hould attend an i&s;&s;ue &s;o uncertain; for I would rather die, than give my vows to a man to whom I could not do ju&s;tice both with regard to head and heart; &s;o, I make it my earne&s;t reque&s;t to him, that he will look upon him&s;elf to be ab&s;olutely free to make his own choice, and to pur|&s;ue his own mea&s;ures, as opportunities offer. Re|joiced at my heart &s;hould I be, to have rea&s;on to con|gratulate him on his nuptials with a woman of the &s;oundne&s;s of who&s;e mind he could have no doubt, and who&s;e heart never knew another attachment.</P>
<P>I would humbly propo&s;e, as a mea&s;ure highly ex|pedient, that the ever-obliging Chevalier Grandi&s;on
<PB N="280" REF="281">
and his truly admirable Lady will permit us, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, to depart from England. [O my friends accu&s;e me not of levity in your hearts! I obeyed in the ra&s;h voyage hither, an Impul&s;e that appeared to me irre&s;i&s;table] And let us leave it to his never-for|feited honour, to bring over to us, as &s;oon as can be convenient, his Lady, his Si&s;ters, and their Lords, as they have made us hope: And that a family friend|&s;hip may be cultivated among us, as if a legal relation had taken place.</P>
<P>But allow me to declare, that if my cou&s;in Lau|rana &s;hall be found to have entertained the lea&s;t rea|&s;on to hope that &s;he might one day be Counte&s;s of Belvedere, that that expectation alone, whatever turn my health may take, &s;hall be con&s;idered as finally determining the Count's expectations on me; for I never will be looked upon as the rival of my cou&s;in.</P>
<P>And now, ble&s;&s;ed Virgin-mother of the God of my hope, do thou enable me to be an humble in|&s;trument of re&s;toring to the hearts of my honoured and indulgent parents, and to tho&s;e of my affectio|nate brothers and other friends, the tranquility of which I have &s;o unhappily and &s;o long deprived them; prays, and will every hour pray, my ever honoured and ever indulgent Father and Mother,</P>

that if &s;he ever married, he might be the happy man; and for the &s;ake of this di&s;tant hope, he was re&s;olved to forego all other engagements. Sir Charles was de&s;ired to acquaint him with the happy tidings. He did, with his u&s;ual prudence: but his joy is extreme.</P>
<P>The Marquis and Marchione&s;s were impatient to embrace and thank their beloved Daughter. The moment &s;he &s;aw them &s;he threw her&s;elf at their feet, as they &s;at together on one &s;ettee, and were ri&s;ing to embrace her&mdash;O my father! O my mo|ther! Have I not been perver&s;e in your eyes?&mdash;It was not I!&mdash;You can pity me!&mdash;It was not always in my <HI>power</HI> to think as I now do. My mind was di&s;turbed. I &s;ought for tranquility, and could no where find it. My brother Guiacomo was too preci|pitating, yet, in his earne&s;tne&s;s to have me marry, &s;hewed his di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s. He gave me not time, as you both, thro' the advice of the common friend of us all have done. The neare&s;t evil was the heavie&s;t to me: I &s;ought to avoid that, and might have fallen into greater. God reward you, my fa|ther, my mother, and all my dear friends, for the in|dulgence you have &s;hewn me!&mdash;To follow me too into foreign climates, at an unpropitious &s;ea&s;on of the year&mdash;And for what?&mdash;Not to chide, not to pu|ni&s;h me; but to re&s;tore me to the arms of your pa|rental love!&mdash;And did you not vouch&s;afe to enter into conditions with your child!&mdash;How greatly di&s;|ordered in my mind mu&s;t I be, if I ever forget &s;uch in&s;tances of your graciou&s;ne&s;s!</P>
<P>The tender parents pre&s;&s;ed her to their bo&s;oms. How did her two brothers and Mrs. Beaumont ap|plaud her!&mdash;</P>
<P>O how good, &s;aid &s;he, are you all to me! What a malady! A malady of the darke&s;t hue! was mine, that it could fill me with &s;uch apprehen&s;ions, as were able to draw a cloud between your goodne&s;s and my gra|titude;
<PB N="282" REF="283">
and make even your indulgence wear the face of hard&s;hip to me.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop thought it not advi&s;eable, that the Count, who hardly knew how to tru&s;t him&s;elf with his own joy, &s;hould be pre&s;ently introduced to her. The rejoicing Lover therefore walked into the garden; giving way to his agreeable contemplations.</P>
<P>Clementina, her mind filled with &s;elf-complacency on the joyful reception her propo&s;al had met with, went into the garden, intending to take one of her u&s;ual walks, Laura attending her. The Count &s;aw her enter, and fearing to di&s;oblige her, if he broke in upon her, in her retirements, profoundly bowed, and took a different path, but &s;he, cro&s;&s;ing another alley, was near him before he was aware. He &s;tarted; but recovering, threw him&s;elf at her feet&mdash;Life of my hope! Adorable Lady Clementina! &s;aid he&mdash;But could not at the moment &s;peak another word.</P>
<P>She relieved him from his confu&s;ion&mdash;Ri&s;e, my Lord, &s;aid &s;he, I cro&s;&s;ed to meet you, on purpo&s;e to exchange a few words with you, as you happened to be in the garden.</P>
<P>I cannot, connot ri&s;e, till, thus pro&s;trate at your feet, I have thanked you, madam, with my whole &s;oul&mdash;</P>
<P>No thanks are due, my Lord, interrupting him. God knows what may happen in the next twelve months. Ri&s;e, my Lord. [He aro&s;e.] As a friend of our hou&s;e, I will re&s;pect you: So I have hereto|fore told you: But for <HI>your own</HI> &s;ake, for honour's, for ju&s;tice &s;ake, I think it nece&s;&s;ary to tell you, you mu&s;t not make an <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> dependance on me from what I have written to my Parents, tho' I repent not of what I have written.</P>
<P>I will not, madam: For one year, for many years; I will await your plea&s;ure. If at the end of any limited period, after that you have named, I cannot be &s;o happy as to engage your favour, I will
<PB N="283" REF="284">
re&s;ign to my de&s;tiny&mdash;Only, mean time, permit me to hope.</P>
<P>I mentioned, my Lord, that it was for <HI>your own</HI> &s;ake, that I wi&s;hed you not to depend upon a contingency. Be you free to pur&s;ue your own mea&s;ures. Who can &s;ay, what one, two, or three years may produce? Maladies that have once &s;eized the head, generally, as I have heard &s;ay, keep their hold, or often re|turned. Have I not <HI>very lately,</HI> been guilty of a great ra&s;hne&s;s? Believe me, Sir, if at the end of the allow|ed year, I &s;hall have rea&s;on to <HI>&s;u&s;pect</HI> my&s;elf, I will <HI>&s;uffer</HI> by my&s;elf. I ever thought you a worthy man: God forbid that I &s;hould make a worthy man unhappy. That would be to double my own mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Generous Lady! exalted goodne&s;s!&mdash;Permit me, I once more be&s;eech you, but to <HI>hope.</HI> I will re&s;ign to your plea&s;ure whatever it &s;hall <HI>finally</HI> be; and ble&s;s you for your determination tho' it &s;hould doom me to de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Remember, my Lord, you are warned. You de|pend upon the regard all our hou&s;e have for you. I owe it duty next to implicit, for its unexampled in|dulgence to me. Your reliance on its favour is not a <HI>w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ak</HI> one: But, O Count, remember I caution you, that your dependence on me, is not a <HI>&s;trong</HI> me. Be prudent: let me not be vexed. My heart &s;ickens at the thought of importunity. Oppo&s;ition has its root in importunity. If you are as happy as I wi&s;h, you will be <HI>very</HI> happy. But at pre&s;ent I have no notion, that I can ever contribute to make you &s;o.</P>
<P>He bent one knee, and was going to reply&mdash;Adieu, adieu, &s;aid &s;he&mdash;Not another word, my Lord, if you are wi&s;e. Are not events in the hand of Providence?</P>
<P>She hurried from him. He was motionle&s;s for a few moments: His heart, however, overflowed with hope, love, and reverence.</P>
<P>On his reporting to the Marchione&s;s, Mrs. Beau|mont, the two Brothers, and me, what pa&s;&s;ed be|tween
<PB N="284" REF="285">
the noble Lady and him, as above, we all con|gratulated him.</P>
<P>The warning Lady Clementina has given you my Lord, &s;aid Mrs. Beaumont, is of a piece with her u&s;ual greatne&s;s of mind, &s;ince the event referred to, is not, cannot be, in her own power.</P>
<P>There is not, &s;aid Signor Jeronymo, there <HI>can</HI> be but one woman greater than my &s;i&s;ter&mdash;It is &s;he, who can adopt as her deare&s;t friend, a young creature of her own Sex in calamity (circum&s;tances &s;o delicate!) and for <HI>her</HI> &s;ake, occa&s;ionally forget that &s;he is the wife of the be&s;t, and mo&s;t beloved of men.</P>
<P>Clementina, &s;aid the Bi&s;hop (the Count being with|drawn) will now complete her triumph. She has, up|on religious motives, refu&s;ed the man of her inclinati|on; the man de&s;ervedly beloved and admired by all her friends, and by the whole world: And now will &s;he, from motives, of duty, accept of another worthy man; and thereby lay her parents them&s;elves, as well as the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted of brothers, under obligation to her.&mdash;What a plea&s;ure, madam, (to the Marchio|ne&s;s) will it be to you, to my honoured Lord, to my Uncle, and even to our Giacomo, and &s;till more to his excellent wife, to reflect on the patience you have had with her, &s;ince her la&s;t ra&s;h &s;tep, and the indulgence &s;hewn her! Clementina now will be all our own.</P>
<P>Every one prai&s;ed Sir Charles, and attributed to him the happy pro&s;pects before them.</P>

<P>THE Marchione&s;s having been de&s;ired to break to Lady Clementina the news of Laurana's death, as of a favour, &s;he did it with all imaginable tender|ne&s;s

<P>The pious lady and her confe&s;&s;or have &s;hut them|&s;elves up in the oratory appropriated for the devotions of this noble family, to pray, as I pre&s;ume, for the &s;oul of Laurana.</P>
<P>Every thing is &s;ettled according to a plan laid down by Lady Clementina, at the reque&s;t of all her family. The Count and Signor Seba&s;tiano, are to &s;et out for Dover on Thur&s;day next. In le&s;s than a month from their departure, the re&s;t of our noble gue&s;ts are to embark for France in their way home&mdash;All but Jeronymo. Sir Charles has prevailed, that he &s;hall be left behind, to try what our Engli&s;h baths may contribute to the perfect re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of his health.</P>
<P>This tender point having been referred to his ad|mirable &s;i&s;ter, &s;he generou&s;ly con&s;ented to his &s;tay with us. She has &s;till <HI>more</HI> generou&s;ly, becau&s;e un|a&s;ked, relea&s;ed Sir Charles from his promi&s;e of at|tending them back to Italy, in con&s;ideration of his Harriet; &s;ince, at this time, he would not know how to leave her; nor &s;he to &s;pare him. But the next &s;ummer, if it be permitted me to look &s;o for|ward, or the &s;ucceeding autumn to that, we hope to be all happy at Bologna. Lady L. Lady G. and their Lords, have promi&s;ed to accompany us: So has Dr. Bartlett; and we all hope, that Sir Edward Beauchamp will not refu&s;e to re-vi&s;it Italy with his friends.</P>

<P>SIX happy days from the date of the Letter which Lady Clementina wrote to her father and mother,
<PB N="286" REF="287">
has the Count pa&s;&s;ed with us; the happie&s;t he often declared, of his life; for in every one of them, he was admitted with a freedom that rejoiced his heart, to conver&s;e with the mi&s;tre&s;s of his de&s;tiny. She call|ed upon him more than once in that &s;pace of time, to behave to her, as a Brother to his Si&s;ter; for this, &s;he thinks, the uncertainty of what her &s;ituation may be a twelvemonth hence, requires for both their &s;akes.</P>
<P>Sweetly compo&s;ed, &s;weetly ea&s;y, was her whole be|haviour to him and to every-body el&s;e, during the&s;e &s;ix days. The &s;i&s;terly character was well &s;upported by her to him: But in the Count, the mo&s;t ardent, the mo&s;t re&s;pectful, and even venerating Lover took place of the brotherly one. Signor Jeronymo loves his Si&s;|ter as he loves him&s;elf; but the eyes of the Count compared with tho&s;e of Jeronymo, demon&s;trated, that there are two &s;orts of Love; yet both ardent; and Soul in both.</P>
<P>The parting &s;cene between Clementina and the Count, was, on <HI>his</HI> &s;ide, a very fervent, on <HI>hers,</HI> a kind, one. On his knees, he pre&s;&s;ed with his lips, her not withdrawn hand. He would have &s;poken; but only could by his eyes; which run over&mdash;Be happy, my Lord of Belvedere, &s;aid &s;he. You have my wi&s;hes for your health and &s;afety&mdash;Adieu!</P>
<P>She was for retiring: But the Count and Sig|nor Seba&s;tiano (of the latter of whom &s;he had taken leave ju&s;t before) following her a few paces, &s;he turned; and with a noble compo&s;ure, Adieu, once more, my two friends, &s;aid &s;he: Take care, my Lord, of Signor Seba&s;tiano: Cou&s;in, take care of the Count of Belvedere; courte&s;ying to both. The Count bowed to the ground, &s;peechle&s;s. As &s;he pa&s;&s;ed me, Lady Grandi&s;on, &s;aid &s;he, li&s;ting my hand to her lips, Si&s;ter of my heart; the day is fine; &s;hall I, after you have ble&s;&s;ed with your good wi&s;hes, our parting friends, invite you into the garden? I
<PB N="287" REF="288">
took a cordial leave of the two noble youths, and fol|lowed her thither.</P>
<P>We had a &s;weet conver&s;ation there. And it was made &s;till more delightful to us both, by Sir Charles's joining us, in about half an hour; for the two Lords would not permit him to attend them one &s;tep be|yound the court yard; though he had his hor&s;es, in readine&s;s to accompany them &s;ome miles on their way.</P>
<P>When we &s;aw Sir Charles enter the garden, we &s;tood &s;till, arm in arm, expecting and inviting his approach. Sweet &s;i&s;ters! Lovely friends, &s;aid he, when come up to us, taking a hand of each, and joining them, bow|ing on both; <HI>Let</HI> me mark this ble&s;&s;ed &s;pot with my eye; looking round him; then on me;&mdash;A tear on my Harriet's cheek!&mdash;He dry'd it off with my own handkerchief&mdash;Friend&s;hip, deare&s;t creatures, will make at plea&s;ure a &s;afe bridge over the narrow &s;eas; it will cut an ea&s;y pa&s;&s;age thro' rocks and mountains, and make England and Italy one country. Kindred &s;ouls are always near.</P>
<P>In that hope, my good Chevalier; in that hope, my dear Lady Grandi&s;on; will Clementina be happy, though the day of &s;eparation mu&s;t not be far di&s;tant. And will you here, renew your promi&s;e, that when it &s;hall be convenient to you, my dear Lady Grandi|&s;on, you will not fail to grace our Italy with your pre&s;ence?</P>
<P>We do!&mdash;We do!&mdash;</P>
<P>Promi&s;e me again, &s;aid the noble Lady. I, too, have marked the &s;pot with my eye (&s;tanding &s;till, and, as Sir Charles had done, looking round her) The Orangery on the right-hand; that di&s;tant clump of Oaklings on the left; the Villa, the Rivulet, be|fore us; the Ca&s;cade in view; that Obeli&s;k behind us&mdash;Be <HI>This</HI> the &s;pot to be recollected as witne&s;s to the promi&s;e, when we are far, far di&s;tant from each other.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="289">
We both repeatexd the promi&s;e; and Sir Charles &s;aid (and he is drawing a plan accordingly) that a little tem|ple &s;hould be erected on that very &s;pot, to be con&s;e|crated to our triple friend&s;hip; and, &s;ince &s;he had &s;o happily marked it, to be called after her name.</P>
<P>On Monday next, we are to &s;et out for London. One fortnight pa&s;&s;ed we &s;hall accompany our noble friends to Dover&mdash;And there&mdash;O my grandmamma, how &s;hall we do to part!</P>
<P>It is agreed, that Mr. Lowther and Mr. Deane, tho' the latter, I ble&s;s God, is in good health; will next &s;ea&s;on accompany Signor Jeronymo to Bath. Sir Charles propo&s;es to be his vi&s;itor there: And when <HI>I</HI> will give permi&s;&s;ion, is the compliment made me. Sir Charles propo&s;es, to &s;hew him Ireland, and his improvements on his e&s;tate in that kingdom. Will not Lucy be re|joiced at that?&mdash;I am happy, that her Lord and &s;he, take &s;o kindly, the felicitations I made them both.

<P>I GAVE you, my dear grandmamma, in my two la&s;t Letters <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The&s;e do not appear.</NOTE>, an account of our delightful engage|ments, among <HI>our&s;elves</HI> principally, and now-and-then at public places. What a rich portion of time has pa&s;&s;ed: And we have &s;till the promi&s;e of a week to come. And how let me take a &s;urvey of our pre&s;ent happy &s;ituation.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="290">
Every thing that <HI>can</HI> be adju&s;ted, is. The Count of Belvedere, as by Letters to Signor Jeronymo, is on his way to Italy, and not unhappy: Lady Cle|mentina is mi&s;tre&s;s of every que&s;tion, and the more &s;tudious, for that rea&s;on, of obliging all her friends. How joyfully do we all, in pro&s;pect, &s;ee a durable tranquillity taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her noble heart! The Marquis and Marchione&s;s have not one care written on their heretofore vi&s;ibly anxious brows. Clementina &s;ees, as every one does, their amended health in their fine countenances; wonders at the power &s;he had over them, and regrets that &s;he made not, what &s;he calls, a more grateful and dutiful u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>Father Mare&s;cotti, the Bi&s;hop, Signor Juliano, compliment the Engli&s;h air, as if <HI>that</HI> had contributed to the alteration; and promi&s;e wonders from that and its &s;alubrious baths for Jeronymo.</P>
<P>The highe&s;t merit is given to the conduct of Sir Charles, and to the advice he gave not to precipitate the noble Clementina.</P>
<P>Lord and Lady L. Lord and Lady G. when we are by our&s;elves, felicitate <HI>me</HI> more than any body el&s;e on the&s;e joyful changes; for they rightly &s;ay, that I could not but look upon the happine&s;s of Lady Cle|mentina, as e&s;&s;ential to my own.</P>
<P>But <HI>your</HI> congratulations, my deare&s;t grand|mamma, I mo&s;t particularly expect, that in this whole critical event, which brought to England a Lady &s;o de&s;erving of every one's Love, not one &s;hadow of doubt has ari&s;en of the tender, inviolable affection of the be&s;t of men to his grateful Harriet.</P>
<P>So peculiarly circum&s;tanced as he was, how un|affectedly noble has been his behaviour to his WIFE, and to his FRIEND, in the pre&s;ence of both! How often, tho' cau&s;ele&s;ly (becau&s;e of the noblene&s;s of the Lady's heart) have I &s;ilently wi&s;hed him to abate of his outward tenderne&s;s to me, before her, tho' &s;uch as
<PB N="290" REF="291">
became the pure&s;t mind.&mdash;Nothing but the con&s;cious integrity of his own heart, above di&s;gui&s;es or con|cealments, as his ever was, could thus gloriou&s;ly have carried him thro' &s;ituations &s;o delicate.</P>
<P>He had, from the fir&s;t, avowed his friendly, his compa&s;&s;ionating Love, as well as Admiration, of this noble Lady: That generous avowal prepared his Harriet to <HI>expect,</HI> that he &s;hould behave with ten|derne&s;s to her, even had not her tran&s;cendent wor|thine&s;s done honour to every one who paid her ho|nour. To <HI>her</HI> he applauded, he exalted his Harriet: <HI>She</HI> was prepared to <HI>expect</HI> that he would recognize, in the face of the &s;un, obligations that he had en|tered into at the altar: And <HI>both</HI> knew, that he was a <HI>good</HI> man; and that a <HI>good</HI> man cannot allow him&s;elf either to palliate or temporize with a duty, whether it regarded friend&s;hip, or a &s;till clo&s;er and more &s;acred union. How many difficulties will the character and intervention of a man of undoubted virtue obviate! What cannot he effect? What force has his example! Sir Charles Grandi&s;on's Love is a Love to be gloried in. Magnanimity and tenderne&s;s are united in his noble heart. Littlene&s;s of any kind has no place in it: All that know him are &s;tudious to commend them&s;elves to his favourable opinion; &s;olicitous about what he will think of them; and, &s;uppre&s;&s;ing common foibles before him, find their hearts expand, nor know how to be mean.</P>
<P>O my God! do thou make me thankful for &s;uch a Friend, Protector, Director, Hu&s;band! Increa&s;e, with my gratitude to THEE, my merits to him, and my power of obliging him. For HIS SAKE, &s;pare to him [<HI>This,</HI> my grandmamma, he bids be <HI>my</HI> prayer&mdash;I know it is <HI>yours</HI>] in the awful hour approach|ing, his Harriet; who&s;e life and welfare, he a&s;&s;ures her, are the deare&s;t part of his own.</P>

The Marquis complimented him, that every one would think them&s;elves &s;afe in the company of &s;o good a man!&mdash;How will they be able to part with him!

<P>THE be&s;t of Men, of Friends, of Hu&s;bands, is returned from Calais, chearful, gay, lively, lovely, fraught with a thou&s;and ble&s;&s;ings for his Harriet. We &s;hall &s;et out, and hope to reach Canterbury this night on our return to town.</P>
<P>Sir Charles a&s;&s;ures me, that he left the dear Si&s;ter of my heart not unhappy. She was <HI>all her&s;elf</HI> at parting [His own words]; magnanimous, yet <HI>conde&s;cendingly affectionate</HI> [His words al&s;o]; as one, who was not afraid or a&s;hamed of her Si&s;terly Love for him. He took leave of her with a tenderne&s;s worthy of his friend&s;hip for her; a tenderne&s;s that the Brave and the Good ever &s;hew to tho&s;e who are de&s;erving of their Love.</P>
<P>He particularly recommended it to her Father, Mo|ther, the Bi&s;hop, and Father Mare&s;cotti (the two lat|ter to enforce it upon the General) that they would not urge the noble Lady, not even upon the expecta|tion &s;he had given them; but leave her wholly to her own will, and her own way. They all promi&s;ed they would; and, the poor Laurana being now no more, undertook for the General.</P>
<P>He tells me, that he had engaged the Court of Belvedere, on his departure from England, to pro|mi&s;e,
<PB N="294" REF="295">
to make his court to her only by &s;ilent a&s;&s;idui|ties, and by tho&s;e actions of beneficence and gene|ro&s;ity which were &s;o natural to him, and &s;o worthy of his &s;plendid fortune.</P>

<P>Lady G. is a charming nur&s;e. She mu&s;t be ex|traordinary in whatever &s;he does. Signor Jeronymo admires her of all women. But &s;he &s;ometimes makes him look about him.

He draws her into the plea&s;antry that &s;he loves; lays him&s;elf open to it; and Lord G. fares the better for their vivacity. Sir Charles generally contrives to do him honour, by appealing to him, when Char|lotte is, as he complains, over-lively with him|&s;elf: But that is, in truth, when he him&s;elf takes her down, and compliments her as if &s;he were an over|match for him. She often, at the&s;e times, &s;hakes her head at me, as if &s;he were &s;en&s;ible of his &s;upe|riority in her own way.</P>

<P>AH, my grandmamma!&mdash;The poor Sir Har|grave!&mdash;</P>
<P>Sir Charles returned but this morning. He found him &s;en&s;ible. He rejoiced to &s;ee him. He in&s;tantly begged his prayers. He wrung his hands; wept; lamented his pa&s;t free life. Fain, &s;aid he, would I have been tru&s;ted with a few years trial of my penitence. I have wearied heaven with my prayers to this purpo&s;e. I <HI>de&s;erved</HI> not perhaps that they &s;hould be heard. My con&s;cience cruelly told me, that I had neglected a multitude of opportuni|ties! &s;lighted a multitude of warnings!&mdash;O Sir Charles Grandi&s;on! It is a hard, <HI>hard</HI> thing to die! In the prime of youth too!&mdash;Such noble po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions!&mdash;</P>
<P>And then he warned his &s;urrounding friends, and made compari&s;ons between Sir Charles's happine&s;s, and his own mi&s;ery. Sir Charles, at his reque&s;t, &s;at up with him all night: He endeavoured to ad|mini&s;ter comfort to him; and called out for mercy for him, when the poor man could only, by expre&s;|&s;ive looks, join in the &s;olemn invocation. Sir Har|grave had begged he would clo&s;e his eyes. He did. He &s;taid to the la&s;t painful moment. Judge what
<PB N="298" REF="299">
&s;uch a heart as Sir Charles's mu&s;t have felt on the awful occa&s;ion!</P>
<P>Poor Sir Hargrave Pollexfen! May he have met with mercy from the All-merciful!</P>
<P>He gave his will into Sir Charles's hands, &s;oon after he came down. He has made him his &s;ole executor. Have you not been told, that Sir Charles had heretofore reconciled him to his relations and heirs at Law? He had the plea&s;ure of finding the reconciliation &s;incere. The poor man &s;poke kindly to them all. They were tenderly careful of him. He acknowleged their care.</P>
<P>I cannot write for tears.&mdash;The poor man, in the la&s;t &s;olemn act of his life, has been <HI>intendedly</HI> kind, but <HI>really</HI> cruel, to me.&mdash;I &s;hould have been a &s;incere mourner for him (A life &s;o mi&s;pent!) without this act of regard for me&mdash;He has left me, as a <HI>&s;mall</HI> atonement, he calls it, for the terrors he once gave me, a very large Legacy in money (Sir Charles has not yet told me what) and his jewels and plate&mdash;And he has left Sir Charles a noble one be&s;ides. He died immen&s;ely rich. Sir Charles is grieved at both Le|gacies: And the more, as he cannot give them back to the heirs; for they declare, that he bound them under a &s;olemn oath (and by a cur&s;e, if they broke it) not to except back either from Sir Charles, or me, the large beque&s;ts he told them he had made us: And they a&s;&s;ured Sir Charles, that they <HI>would be</HI> religiou&s;ly bound by it.</P>
<P>Many unhappy objects will be the better for the&s;e beque&s;ts. Sir Charles tells me, that he will not in|terfere, no, not &s;o much as by his advice, in the di&s;|po&s;al of mine. You, madam, and my aunt Selby, mu&s;t direct me, when it comes into my hands. Sir Charles intends, that the poor man's memory &s;hall receive true honour from the di&s;po&s;ition of his Legacy to him. He is plea&s;ed with his Harriet, for the concern &s;he expre&s;&s;ed for this unhappy man.
<PB N="299" REF="300">
The mo&s;t indulgent of hu&s;bands finds out &s;ome rea&s;on to prai&s;e her for every thing &s;he &s;ays and does. But could HE be otherwi&s;e than the be&s;t of HUSBANDS, who was the mo&s;t dutiful of SONS; who is the mo&s;t affectionate of BROTHERS; the mo&s;t faithful of FRIENDS: Who is good upon principle, in every relation of life?</P>
<P>What, my dear grandmamma, is the boa&s;ted cha|racter of mo&s;t of tho&s;e who are called HEROES, to the un-o&s;tentatious merit of a TRULY GOOD MAN? In what a variety of amiable lights does &s;uch a one appear? In how many ways is he a ble&s;&s;ing and a joy to his fellow-creatures?</P>
<P>And this ble&s;&s;ing, this joy, your Harriet can call more peculiarly her own!</P>
<P>My &s;ingle heart, methinks, is not big enough to contain the gratitude which &s;uch a Lot demands. Let the overflowings of your pious joy, my deare&s;t grandmamma, join with my thankfulne&s;s in paying part of the immen&s;e debt for</P>

<HEAD>A Concluding NOTE BY The EDITOR.</HEAD>
<P>THE Editor of the foregoing collection has the more readily undertaken to pub|li&s;h it, becau&s;e he thinks Human Nature has often, of late, been &s;hewn in a light too degrading; and he hopes from this Series of Letters it will be &s;een, that characters may be good, without being unnatural. Sir Charles Grandi|&s;on him&s;elf is &s;en&s;ible of imperfections, and, as the reader will remember, accu&s;es him&s;elf more than once of tendencies to pride and pa&s;&s;ion, which it required his utmo&s;t caution and vigilance to rein-in; and many there are, who look upon his offered com|promi&s;e with the Porretta Family, in allowing the daughters of the propo&s;ed marriage to be brought up by the mother, re&s;erving to him&s;elf the education of the &s;ons only, as a blot in the character. Indeed, Sir Charles him&s;elf declares to the General, that he would not have come into &s;uch a compromi&s;e in a beginning addre&s;s, not even with a prince&s;s.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this, it has been ob&s;erved by &s;ome, that, in general, he approaches too near the faultle&s;s character which critics cen&s;ure as above nature: Yet it ought to be ob&s;erved too, that he performs no one action which it is not in the power
<PB N="301" REF="302">
of any man in his &s;ituation <HI>to</HI> perform; and that he checks and re&s;trains him&s;elf in no one in&s;tance in which it is not the duty of a prudent and good man <HI>to</HI> re&s;train him&s;elf.</P>
<P>It has been objected by &s;ome per&s;ons, that a man le&s;s able by &s;trength or &s;kill to repel an affront, than Sir Charles appears to have been, could not with <HI>&s;uch</HI> honour have extricated him&s;elf out of difficulties on refu&s;ing a challenge. And this is true, meaning by <HI>honour</HI> the favourable opinion of the European world, from the time of its being over-run by Go|thic barbari&s;m, down to the pre&s;ent. But as that notion of hon ur is evidently an ab&s;urd and mi&s;chie|vous one, and yet multitudes are at a lo&s;s to get over it, the rejection and con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">utation of it by a per&s;on whom, it was vi&s;ible, the con&s;ideration of his own &s;afety did not influence, mu&s;t &s;urely be of no &s;mall weight. And when it is once allowed, that there are ca&s;es and circum&s;tances in which the&s;e polite <HI>in|vitations to murder</HI> may con&s;i&s;tently with honour be di&s;regarded, a little attention will ea&s;ily find others; vulgar notions will in&s;en&s;ibly wear out; and more ground be gained by degrees, than could have been attempted with hope of &s;ucce&s;s, at once; till at length all may come to &s;tand on the firm footing of rea&s;on and religion.</P>
<P>In the mean time, they who are <HI>le&s;s</HI> qualified to carry off right behaviour with honour in the eye of common judges, will, however, be e&s;teemed for it by every &s;erious and prudent per&s;on; and, perhaps, inwardly by many who are mean enough to join outwardly in blaming them.</P>
<P>Indeed, when a per&s;on hath <HI>de&s;erved</HI> har&s;h treat|ment, his acquie&s;cence under it, may generally be imputed to fear alone, and &s;o render him an object at once of hatred and ridicule, hardly po&s;&s;ible to be borne: But he who &s;upports a conduct equally of|fen&s;ive, by ever &s;o much brutal courage, tho' a le&s;s
<PB N="302" REF="303">
contemptible, is a va&s;tly more dete&s;table, creature: Whil&s;t an upright and harmle&s;s man, &s;uppo&s;e him ever &s;o timorous, merits rather a kind &s;ort of pity than violent &s;corn.</P>
<P>But whoever declines forbidden in&s;tances of &s;elf|vindication, not from fear but from principle; which is always to be pre&s;umed, if his regard to principle be &s;teady and uniform in other things; &s;uch a one, however inferior to Sir Charles Grandi&s;on in advan|tages of nature and art, yet, if he &s;hews real great|ne&s;s of mind in &s;uch things as all men <HI>may,</HI> needs not doubt but he &s;hall be re&s;pected by mo&s;t, and may be &s;ufficiently ea&s;y, tho' he is de&s;pi&s;ed by &s;ome. He will &s;till have the &s;atisfaction of reflecting, that the Laws of all nations are on his &s;ide,
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><P>It is &s;o highly worth ob&s;erving, that even the <HI>military</HI> Law of our own country is &s;trongly again&s;t duel|ling, that the Editor cannot help &s;ubjoining an extract out of the articles of War, and recommending it to the con&s;ideration of all military per&s;ons.</P>

only the u&s;urped authority of a &s;illy modern cu&s;tom again&s;t him; that on many occa&s;ions, worthy men in all ages, have patiently &s;uffered <HI>fal&s;e</HI> di&s;grace for adhering to their duty; that the true bravery is to adhere to all duties under all di&s;advantages; and that refu&s;ing a duel is a duty to our&s;elves, our fellow-crea|tures, and our MAKER. And whoever acts on the&s;e principles, the more reproach he undergoes for it, father than be driven, like a coward, by the &s;coffs of his fellow-&s;ubjects, to rebel again&s;t the SOVE|REIGN of the Univer&s;e, will have the more delight|ful con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a &s;trong inward principle of piety and virtue, and the more di&s;tingui&s;hed reward from the final Judge of all, who alone di&s;po&s;es of that Honour which &s;hall never fade.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid in b half of many modern ficti|tious pieces, in which authors have given &s;ucce&s;s (and <HI>happine&s;s,</HI> as it is called) to their heroes of vi|cious, if not of profligate, characters, that they have exhibited Human Nature as it <HI>is.</HI> Its corruption may, indeed, be exhibited in the faulty character; but need pictures of this be held out in books? Is not vice crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, triumphant, and rewarded, and perhaps &s;et off with wit and &s;pirit, a dangerous repre&s;entation? And is it not made even <HI>more</HI> danger|ous by the ha&s;ty reformation introduced, in con|tradiction to all probability, for the &s;ake of patching up what is called a happy ending?</P>
<P>The God of Nature intended not Human Nature for a vile and contemptible thing: And many are the in&s;tances, in every age, of tho&s;e whom He enables, amid&s;t all the frailties of mortality, to do it honour. Still the <HI>be&s;t</HI> performances of human creatures will be imperfect; but, &s;uch as they are, it is &s;urely both delightful and in&s;tructive to dwell &s;ometimes on this bright &s;ide of things; To &s;how, by a &s;eries of facts in common life, what a degree of excellence may be

attained and pre&s;erved amid&s;t all the infection of fa|&s;hionable vice and folly.</P>
<P>Sir CHARLES GRANDISON is therefore in the general tenor of his principles and conduct (tho' exerted in peculiarities of circum&s;tances that cannot always be accommodated to particular imitation) pro|po&s;ed for an Example; and, in offering him as &s;uch were his character &s;till more perfect than it is pre|&s;umed to be, the Editor is &s;upported by an eminent Divine of our own contry.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There is no manner of inconvenience in having a pattern propounded to us of &s;o great perfection, as is above our reach to attain to; and there may be great advantages in it. The way to excel in any kind, is, <HI>optima quaeque exempla ad imitandum proponere;</HI> to propo&s;e the brighte&s;t and mo&s;t per|fect Examples to our imitation. No man can write after too perfect and good a copy; and tho' he can never reach the perfection of it, yet he is like to learn more, than by one le&s;s perfect.

<HEAD>The following unlucky omi&s;&s;ion in Letter <HI>III.</HI> of this Vo|lume, written by Mi&s;s <HI>Lucy Selby</HI> to Lady G. is thought proper to be &s;upplied here.</HEAD>
<P>P. 10. That young Lady thus writes: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He [Sir Charles] hopes for a vi&s;it from the Italian family, &s;o de&s;ervedly dear to him, by which hers to re|gulate many of his future motions:</Q> [Then fol|lows the omi&s;&s;ion.]</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ay I wi&s;h for this vi&s;it. I love, I admire, I pity them; and would, had I wings, take a flight into Italy, with all my heart, to &s;ee them incognita. Clementina mu&s;t be a charming creature&mdash;but, for Harriet's &s;ake, I have been u&s;ed to think of her with terror.</P>
<P>For your Brother's &s;ake al&s;o, Lady G. I rejoice, and &s;o, you know, do Dr. Bartlett and Mrs. Shirley, that &s;he can now be only a Vi&s;iter. How could Sir Charles, &s;o thorough an Engli&s;hman, have been happy with an Italian wife? His heart indeed, is, generou&s;ly open and benevolent to people of all countries: He is, as I have often heard you &s;ay, in the noble&s;t &s;en&s;e, a Citizen of the World: But, &s;ee we not, that his long re&s;idence abroad, has only the more endeared to him the Religion, the Government, the Manners of England? You know, that on a double Principle of Religion and Policy, he encourages the Trades-people, the Manufactures, the Servants, of his own Country. Do I not remember a charmingly lively debate between you and him, on the &s;ubject of tho&s;e Eleganc&s;es in Dre&s;s and Appearance which you &s;aid (and I thought you naughty for &s;aying it) were only to be acquired by employing the <HI>better</HI> ta&s;te of Foreigners?</P>
<P>He concluded it &s;eriou&s;ly. I recollect nearly his Words: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Error, Lady G. is growing too ge|neral,
<PB N="390" REF="391">
is authorized by too many per&s;ons of figure, not to make one afraid of fatal con&s;equences, from what in its beginning &s;eemed a trifle. Shall any one pretend to true Patrioti&s;m, and not attempt to &s;tem this torrent of Fa&s;hion, which impoveri&s;hes our own hone&s;t Countrymen, whil&s;t it carries Wealth and Power to tho&s;e who&s;e National Religion and Intere&s;t are directly oppo&s;ite to ours!"</Q></P>
<P>Good Heaven, thought I, at the time, how was this noble-minded man entangled by delicacies of &s;itu|ation, by friend&s;hip, by compa&s;&s;ion, that he &s;hould ever have been like to be engaged in a family of Ro|man Catholics, and lived half of his days out of his beloved Country! And the other half to have &s;et, as to the world's eye, &s;uch an Example in it!</P>
<P>I know, Lady G. he would have made it his &s;tudy to prevent any mi&s;chief to his neighbours from the active zeal of his Lady's Confe&s;&s;or, had a certain compromi&s;e taken effect. I remember the hint he gave to Father Mare&s;cotti: But would even <HI>that</HI> good man have thought him&s;elf bound to ob&s;erve Faith with Heretics in &s;uch a ca&s;e?</P>
<P>Whither am I rambled! I was going to tell you, that if this Italian Family comes over, his new taken hou&s;e, &amp;c.</P>
