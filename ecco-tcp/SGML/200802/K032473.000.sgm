<BIBL>JONAH, c. 3. v. 7, 8.</BIBL>
<Q><P>Let neither Man nor Bea&s;t, Herd nor Flock ta&s;te any Thing, let them not feed nor drink Water.</P></Q>
<Q><P>But let Man and Bea&s;t be covered with Sack|cloth, and cry mightily unto God; yea, let them turn every one from his evil Way.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE perpetual &s;uperintendency of Divine Pro|vidence in the government of the Univer&s;e, and Direction of natural&punc; Cau&s;es, towards the Encouragement of good, and the Puni&s;hment of evil Doers, are Truths which none but the Impious and Prophane have ever dared to call in Que&s;tion. The Powers and Qualities of all created Beings are render'd &s;ub&s;ervient to the De&s;ign and Purpo&s;e of him who made them, and become the In&s;trument of his Favour or Di&s;plea&s;ure towards the Sons of Men.</P>
<P>IN the common and ordinary Cour&s;e of Things, we do not indeed &s;o vi&s;ibly di&s;cern this great and univer&s;al Spring which actuates every Motion: In the Conduct and Fate of Individuals therefore, the Interpo&s;ition of the Almighty doth too frequently e&s;cape our Notice
<PB N="4" REF="3">
and Ob&s;ervation; but when his Hand is &s;tretch'd out over the Nations of the Earth, when Millions feel his Wrath, and Kingdoms bow down before him; when his &s;ignal Judgments affright, and his Terrors di&s;may us; when the Angel of De&s;truction is commi&s;&s;ion'd by him to puni&s;h offending Multitudes, and call Sin|ners to Repentance; when Sword, Pe&s;tilence and Famine, Snow and Hail, Storm and Tempe&s;t fulfill his Word, then doth Mankind awaken from it's Le|thargy of Sin and Ignorance, and di&s;cover the imme|diate Agency and Interpo&s;ition of the Divine Being; then is the Sentence of an angry God legible to every Eye, written as it were in Characters of Fire, and pointing out the Finger of the Almighty.</P>
<P>IF we turn over the in&s;tructive Pages of Holy Writ, we &s;hall find this perpetual governing Providence ex|plain'd by inconte&s;tible Evidence, and illu&s;trated by the mo&s;t &s;ignal Examples.</P>
<P>AND among&s;t them all, there is not perhaps one, wherein the Power, the Ju&s;tice, and the Goodne&s;s of God are more immediately vi&s;ible than in that which is recorded in the third Chapter of the Book of the Prophet <HI>Jonah.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>City of</HI> Nineveh, &s;ays the Prophet, <HI>was an ex|ceeding great City,</HI> probably as eminently &s;uperior to Others in the Wickedne&s;s, as in the Number of it's In|habitants; a profligate and abandon'd Race of Men, who went on from Folly to Folly, and from Sin to Sin, till they had exhau&s;ted the Patience and Long-&s;uffering of an offended God, and fill'd up the Mea&s;ure of their Iniquity; till at length, the Lord &s;ent unto them his faithful Prophet, the Me&s;&s;enger of &s;ad and heavy Ti|dings,
<PB N="5" REF="4">
to denounce unto them their immediate De|&s;truction; and <HI>Jonah</HI> cried and &s;aid, <HI>yet forty Days, and</HI> Nineveh <HI>&s;hall be overthrown.</HI></P>
<P>A Sentence &s;o dreadful, and &s;o unexpected, was received, we may imagine, with an equal Degree of Terror and A&s;toni&s;hment; they beheld them&s;elves in a Moment on the Brink of Ruin, the Stroke was certain, the Fate was unavoidable.</P>
<P>THE Truth of what was foretold, would admit of no Doubt or Di&s;putation; the Authority of the Per&s;on who deliver'd the Prophecy, the Preci&s;ene&s;s of the Time affix'd for it's Accompli&s;hment, the Con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of their own Guilt, all con&s;pired to per&s;uade them that their De&s;truction was nigh at Hand; their Fears were alarm'd, their Souls awaken'd, their Hearts melted by the approaching Danger; what therefore could be done on &s;o &s;olemn, &s;o melancholy an Occa|&s;ion? Omnipotence was not to be re&s;i&s;ted, nor Omni&s;|cience to be deceived; they could only humble them|&s;elves before the Lord, implore Pardon and Forgive|ne&s;s, and throw them&s;elves on his Mercy. <HI>Who can tell,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce Anger, that we peri&s;h not? So the People of</HI> Nineveh <HI>believed God, and proclaimed a Fa&s;t, and put on Sackcloth, from the greate&s;t of them even to the lea&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>THE Sovereign of this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Nation, is de&s;cribed to us by the Prophet as exactly re&s;embling our own; &s;o|licitous for the Welfare, feeling for the Calamities, anxious for the Reformation of his afflicted People; he recommends to them in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing Manner the &s;trict and religious Ob&s;ervance of the Fa&s;t, and enforces it by his own Royal Example.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5">
<HI>HE</HI> aro&s;e from his Throne, and laid his Robe from him, and covered him with Sackcloth, and &s;at in A&s;hes, and he cau&s;ed it to be proclaimed and publi&s;hed through <HI>Nineveh,</HI> by the Decree of the King and his Nobles, &s;aying,</P>
<P><HI>LET</HI> neither Man nor Bea&s;t, Herd nor Flock ta&s;te any Thing; let them not feed, nor drink Water.</P>
<P><HI>BUT</HI> let Man and Bea&s;t be covered with Sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God, yea, let them turn every one from his evil Way.</P>
<P>NO &s;ooner was this &s;olemn Decree pronounced, but it was univer&s;ally complied with; they fa&s;ted, prayed, and repented; they lamented their Sins, wept for their Iniquities, and turned unto the Lord their God.</P>
<P>AND now let us carefully ob&s;erve the Con&s;equence of their Conduct and Behaviour; the Effect was pro&s;|perous, far beyond all which their mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes could promi&s;e them.</P>
<P><HI>GOD,</HI> who&s;e Mercy is over all his Works, and who hateth nothing that he has made, <HI>took Compa&s;&s;ion on them; he beheld their &s;orrow and Contrition, and would not that it &s;hould pa&s;s unob&s;erved or unrewarded;</HI> he &s;aw their Works, <HI>&s;ays the Prophet,</HI> that they turned from their evil Way, and God repented of the Evil that he had &s;aid that he would do unto them, and he did it not.</P>
<P>SUCH an In&s;tance of gracious Conde&s;cen&s;ion, and un&s;peakable Mercy, cannot but affect our Minds with the &s;tronge&s;t Sen&s;e of Gratitude, and afford Matter of Comfort and Con&s;olation to a &s;inful and afflicted People.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">
IT is indeed an Example, which if duly attended to by us on this &s;olemn Occa&s;ion, may be an u&s;eful Monitor, and &s;erve in this Hour of Peril, to direct our Ways, and to guide our Foot&s;teps aright.</P>
<P>LET us then &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider and reflect on the Ex|ample before us, and as we but too nearly re&s;emble the People of <HI>Nineveh</HI> in the Multitude of our Sins, let us endeavour to imitate them in our Repentance al&s;o; and to this End let us lay before our&s;elves the Means which they pur&s;ued, and the Methods which they made u&s;e of to bring on this &s;alutary Effect.</P>
<P>AND fir&s;t then, it appears by the Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Ninevites,</HI> as recorded in holy Writ, that the Duty of Fa&s;ting was always highly acceptable unto God, and that therefore it will mo&s;t probably always continue to be &s;o.</P>
<P>FASTING is a Duty indeed which though it had not the Sanction of the Almighty to recommend, or his Authority to enforce it, would by the common Rules of Prudence and Di&s;cretion lay Claim to our frequent Practice and Ob&s;ervation of it: Even when &s;he is not employ'd in the &s;olemn Offices of Religion, to a&s;&s;i&s;t Repentance and rai&s;e Devotion, &s;he may &s;till be con&s;i|dered as the Hand&punc;maid of Temperance, the Compa|nion of Health, and the Coun&s;ellor of Virtue.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t poignant of human Plea&s;ures will cloy without &s;ome Pau&s;e, and &s;atiate without &s;ome inter|mi&s;&s;ion; Ab&s;tinence therefore is nece&s;&s;ary to enhance the Value of every Ble&s;&s;ing, and give a Reli&s;h to every Enjoyment.</P>
<P>BUT if this Virtue is u&s;eful in the common Cour&s;e of our Affairs, it becometh an Act &s;till more &s;olemn and
<PB N="8" REF="7">
important when it is made u&s;e of to avert the Judgments of God, and turn a&s;ide his Indignation from us.</P>
<P>WE have &s;een the great and glorious Effect which it produced in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Nineveh;</HI> to the &s;ame End, and for the &s;ame Purpo&s;es was it appointed on this Day; and may the God of Patience and long-&s;uffering a&s;&s;i&s;t us with the &s;ame Portion of his divine Favour, and reward us al&s;o in like Manner for our Ob&s;ervance of it.</P>
<P><HI>LET us then, my Brethren,</HI> not ta&s;te any Thing, nei|ther feed, nor drink Water; <HI>but let us, with the Peo|ple of</HI> Nineveh, cover our&s;elves with Sackcloth, and turn every one from his evil Way.</P>
<P>THE Pulpit is not, ought not, certainly to be the Seat of Politics, or the Field for national and public Affairs; but here Occa&s;ion warrants, and Nece&s;&s;ity de|mands it of us.</P>
<P>WE are call'd upon this Day by the Voice of public Authority to cry aloud, and forbidden to &s;pare; to echo the Voice of our Rulers and lament the Crimes and Calamities of our Country; to &s;ay, that from a brave, a virtuous, and a &s;ucce&s;sful, we are now grown a &s;inful, weak, and unhappy People. <HI>We are become,</HI> as the P&s;almi&s;t &s;ays, <HI>an open Shame to our Enemies; the very Scorn and Deri&s;ion of all tho&s;e that are round about us.</HI> Is it not, my Brethren, a melancholy Con&s;ideration, to &s;ee a Land of Plenty like this, reduced to a State of Penury and Famine; a Land of Honour and Virtue, changed into a Land of Folly and Corruption; a Land of Freemen, into a Land of Slaves; a Land of Chri&s;|tians, into a Land of Pagans, Dei&s;ts, and Freethinkers?</P>
<P>THERE was a Time when private Virtue &s;upported public Welfare and Pro&s;perity; when the Peace and
<PB N="9" REF="8">
Safety of Society was en&s;ured by the Prudence and Pie|ty of every Individual: There were once &s;uch things as Patrioti&s;m, Sincerity, and Integrity among&s;t us. Our Ance&s;tors &s;acrificed every thing to the Love of our Country, whil&s;t we &s;acrifice the Love of our Country to every thing el&s;e. Fa&s;hion, in &s;hort, hath deluded, Luxury hath enervated, Plea&s;ure hath enchanted us.</P>
<P>THE &s;low and &s;ecret Poi&s;on of Corruption hath in&s;i|nuated it&s;elf into every Vein; inffu&s;ed a Li&s;tle&s;ne&s;s and languor over the whole Frame; undermined and prey'd upon the Con&s;titution. We remain &s;upine and inac|tive; and even whil&s;t Mi&s;ery is pouring in upon us, &s;eem utterly in&s;en&s;ible of it. We lull our Sen&s;es to Oblivion in the Arms of Indolence, and at the &s;ame Time fondly imagine our&s;elves repo&s;ing on the Bo&s;om of Security.</P>
<P>THIS, my Brethren, is not Declamation, but Fact; it is not the malignant Sugge&s;tion of Calumny and Sa|tire, but the &s;erious melancholy Reflection of Experi|ence and Truth.</P>
<P>IF the <HI>Ninevites</HI> had not been great and mi&s;erable Sin|ners, the &s;olemn Denunciation of the Prophet <HI>Jonas</HI> would not have fallen upon them; and if we al&s;o had not offended the Lord of Heaven and Earth, he would not have &s;ent down his heavy Judgments upon us. To bring this Matter home then to our own Brea&s;ts and the pre&s;ent &s;olemn Occa&s;ion; the Angel of De&s;truction is gone forth, the Sword of War is un&s;heathed, and the Arrows of the Almighty are &s;harpened again&s;t us. A great and powerful Enemy threatens us from abroad; our own Sins and Wickedne&s;s oppre&s;s and weigh us down at Home.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9">
LET me then a&s;k you a few &s;erious and important Que&s;tions; is this a Time to &s;pread the Table of Lux|ury, or to wanton in the Gardens of Plea&s;ure? Is it a Time to revel in the Fea&s;t of Sen&s;uality, whil&s;t thou|&s;ands are &s;tarving around us? or to &s;ound the In&s;tru|ments of Joy and Fe&s;tivity amid&s;t the Groans of War, and the Shrieks of public Calamity? Shall the Mourner for his Country, and &s;uch we ought all to be, put on his gorgeous apparel, and appear at the Funeral of his fellow-Citizens in the Wedding Garment? Is there yet among&s;t us a Head &s;o void of Under&s;tanding, as not to perceive our wretched Situation? Is there a Heart &s;o callous and in&s;en&s;ible as not to feel for and &s;ympathize with our bleeding Country? Shall we then pollute our la&s;t Moments with Sin, and expire in the Arms of Riot and Debauchery?</P>
<P>REMEMBER the People of <HI>Nineveh;</HI> they were grie|vous Sinners like our&s;elves, but they fa&s;ted, repented, and were forgiven: As we have been guilty of their Sins, we have rea&s;on to fear the Judgment denounced again&s;t them; but if we imitate their Example in our Reformation, we may &s;till hope for their Pardon, and look for their Reward.</P>
<P>LET us then con&s;ider this Day's Solemnity, as the Foundation on which we are to build the Structure of our future happine&s;s; as the Time appointed to &s;ow the Seeds of our Repentance, which with due Care and Culture may take Root, and &s;hoot forth hereafter into a rich and plenteous Harve&s;t: Let us con&s;ider this Day's Ab&s;tinence as only an Emblem or Type of that total, that far more nece&s;&s;ary Ab&s;tinence from Sin and Wick|edne&s;s which we all purpo&s;e henceforth religiou&s;ly to ob&s;erve. <HI>Let us keep the Fa&s;t, not with the Leaven of</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="10">
<HI>Malice and Sin, but with the unleavened Bread of Since|rity and Truth.</HI></P>
<P>LET me addre&s;s you then as Fellow-Creatures, Fellow-Citizens, and Fellow-Subjects: By the decay of public Virtue one Link of the great Chain of Per|fection is lo&s;t, which hath loo&s;en'd the whole; let us &s;trive to re&s;tore and reunite it. It may be &s;aid in|deed, and perhaps with &s;ome truth, that we &s;till keep up the Appearance of Religion and Virtue; that the Places of public Wor&s;hip are &s;till not only open, but frequently, (and the Congregation now before me is a Confirmation of it) re&s;orted to, and even crouded; but let us not therefore, becau&s;e we can deceive others, de|ceive our&s;elves al&s;o: It is not merely the a&s;&s;embling our&s;elves together in the Hou&s;e of the Lord, Fa&s;ting, or <HI>appearing unto Men to fa&s;t,</HI> which will recommend us to his divine Favour; unle&s;s we ob&s;erve his Laws, and obey his Commandments. For if the Moment we return to our own Homes, we return al&s;o to all the Vices and all the Follies that we left behind us, what is our &s;hort Attendance on the Almighty but a &s;olemn Mock|ery of his Power, and an impious Di&s;tru&s;t of his Omni|&s;cience?</P>
<P>WE have all been acce&s;&s;ary to the Guilt of our Coun|try; &s;hould we not then contribute to her Repentance and Reformation al&s;o? National Iniquity mu&s;t bring on national Ruin, and in that Ruin mu&s;t we all be involved, if we are not careful to prevent it. If then we would &s;ave, let us help our&s;elves; let us remember that the <HI>wor&s;t of Foes,</HI> when they are Foes, <HI>are tho&s;e of our own Hou&s;hold.</HI> The Traitor within mu&s;t con&s;pire with the Enemy without, before we can be entirely lo&s;t. <HI>England,</HI> whenever &s;he falls, mu&s;t fall by her own Hand; and to the Guilt of Murther mu&s;t add the Crime of Suicide al&s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">
THE late extraordinary and unparallel'd Succe&s;s of our noble Friend and Ally, is a recent and a &s;triking In&s;tance to convince us how much the Virtue, the Con|duct, the Example of one Man may influence the Ac|tions and rule the Fate of thou&s;ands: His Arms were crown'd with Conque&s;t, and we, it is to be hoped, &s;hall in &s;ome Mea&s;ure reap the Fruits of it. But &s;hould it not cha&s;ti&s;e our Joy, and le&s;&s;en our Exultation to reflect that this Nation &s;hould thus borrow that Fame, which &s;he u&s;ed to be&s;tow; and &s;tand indebted to foreign Courage for what &s;he had a Right to expect from dome&s;tic Vir|tue. Is <HI>Britain</HI> at la&s;t &s;o poor in Valour as to depend upon another's Arms for her Safety; another's Bravery for her Defence; another's Victory for her Triumphs?</P>
<P>LET us for Shame, my Fellow-countrymen, at length &s;ee, and think, and act for our&s;elves. If we have that Reverence for our Country, and that Regard for our Sovereign which we all profe&s;s, let Religion be our Patrioti&s;m; if we are ambiti|ous to be thought good Subjects, let us endeavour to be good Chri&s;tians; let us &s;hew our Loyalty by our Lives, and our Obedience by our Virtue. Let every Man be per&s;uaded, that the Welfare, the Safety, and the Pre&s;ervation of the&s;e Kingdoms depends on his own Conduct and Behaviour: We cannot all of us take the Field and bear the Sword in the Service of our King, but we may all gird on us the Sword of Truth, and defend him with the Buckler of Righteou&s;ne&s;s; Virtue would add fre&s;h Strength to every Arm, and Sharpne&s;s to every Sword; Innocence would give us Courage, Integrity would make us brave; and if the Enemy could once find us uncorrupted, they would &s;oon prove us to be unconquerable. As by our Fol|lies and our Crimes we have brought on Danger and
<PB N="13" REF="12">
Difficulty, &s;o may we remove them by Goodne&s;s and Reformation; and in&s;ure Succe&s;s and Victory abroad, by Penitence and Piety at Home.</P>
<P>BUT farther; every Man has &s;ome Friends who love and e&s;teem him; &s;ome who are guided by his Exam|ple, and led by his Direction; every one has &s;ome Power, and &s;ome Influence over others; let that Pow|er be exerted, let that Influence be diffu&s;ed, that &s;o the generous Flame may catch from Brea&s;t to Brea&s;t, &s;pread it&s;elf through every Limb, and animate the whole reformed, pardoned, happy Nation.</P>
<P><HI>BUT la&s;tly, let us remember what that Fa&s;t is which the Lord hath cho&s;en, not only</HI> to loo&s;e the Bonds of Wickedne&s;s, but to loo&s;e the heavy Burthens, and let the oppre&s;&s;ed go free; to deal our Bread to the hungry, and relieve the afflicted Soul.</P>
<P>A LITTLE, a very little will &s;uffice to &s;atisfy Na|ture; if it were not &s;o, how few in the&s;e cruel Days would be able to &s;urvive! What therefore we may &s;pare from our own Superfluities, let us be&s;tow on the Nece&s;&s;ity of others; what we &s;ave by fa&s;ting, let us give in Charity; thus &s;hall we, at the &s;ame Time, pre&s;erve our&s;elves innocent, and make our Fellow-creatures happy, <HI>cea&s;e to do Evil, and learn to do Good.</HI></P>
<P>WE all feel the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Times, and all com|plain of it. If even the Rich lament it, in the Bo|&s;om of Affluence, how mu&s;t the Poor and De&s;titute, who &s;hiver in the cold Regions of Adver&s;ity and Af|fliction; alas! what is our Want to their Penury, our Difficulty to their De&s;pair! The Storm, which we only dread at a Di&s;tance, is even now pouring on their Heads, &s;hall we not then afford them a little Relief, a little Shelter from it?</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13">
To conclude then, let us all heartily and &s;peedily &s;et about a general Reformation; from this Day of &s;olemn Humiliation let us count our Righteou&s;ne&s;s; from this au&s;picious Aera let us date our Virtue; let it be re|corded in the Annals of our Nation, that this Year open'd the Eyes of an offending People, and reconciled them to their God; &s;aved them from his ju&s;t Judg|ment, recommended them to his Pardon, and re&s;tored them to his divine Favour and Protection; that he took them once more under the Shadow of his Wings, &s;aved his repenting Nation, <HI>fed them, and &s;et them up for ever; pre&s;erved them from Trouble, and com|pa&s;&s;ed them about with Songs of Deliverance: that the Lord gave Strength unto his People, and gave his People the Ble&s;&s;ing of Peace.</HI></P>
<P>PERMIT me to hope then, my Brethren, that you will heartily and &s;incerely join with me in this nece&s;|&s;ary and humble Supplication;</P>
<P><HI>ALmighty and ever-living God, thou great and in|exhau&s;tible Fountain of Good and Happine&s;s! in who&s;e Hand are all the Corners of the Earth; on who&s;e Aid we mu&s;t depend for our Support, on who&s;e Bounty we mu&s;t rely for Succour, and to who&s;e Mercy we mu&s;t &s;ue for Pardon; accept the Prayers of thy penitent Peo|ple; behold, O! Lord, we acknowledge our Faults; our Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions are multiplied before thee, and our Sins te&s;tify again&s;t us; but thy Hand, O! Lord, is not &s;hortened that it cannot &s;ave, neither thine Ear heavy that it can|not hear; hear then, O! Lord, and &s;ave; let this Day's Humiliation be accepted as an Earne&s;t of our future Repentance, and this Day's Acknowledgment of our Sins plead with thee for Pardon of our pa&s;t Iniquities: Turn away thy Wrath, and be not angry with us for ever.
<PB N="15" REF="14">
Return, we be&s;eech thee, O! God of Ho&s;ts, look down from Heaven and behold, what only thou can&s;t behold, the Heart of the repentant Sinner: Spare us, thou God of Mercy; a&s;&s;i&s;t us, thou God of Power; pro&s;per us, thou God of Victory; &s;uffer not our Follies to &s;ink, or our Iniquities to overwhelm us; go forth, we be&s;eech thee, in this Hour of Peril, with our Fleets and Armies; &s;trengthen the Hands of our gracious Sovereign; pre&s;ide over his Councils, and direct his Ways; &s;heath, O! Lord, the Sword of Battle that is drawn forth again&s;t us; take off from this afflicted Nation the bloody Garment of War, and put upon us the Robe of Peace; that by the Provi|dence of thy Goodne&s;s, every Evil di&s;per&s;ed, and every Enemy &s;ubdued, we, thy repentant Servants, being hurt by no Per&s;ecutions, may &s;erve and plea&s;e thee in Newne&s;s of Life, prai&s;ing and giving Thanks unto thee in thy holy Church, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</HI></P>
