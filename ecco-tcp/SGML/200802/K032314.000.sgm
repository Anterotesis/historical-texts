<HEAD>To all the Generous Encouragers of <HI>Female In|genuity,</HI> this <HI>Play</HI> is Humbly Dedicated.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen and Ladies;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY Mu&s;e cho&s;e to make this Univer&s;al Addre&s;s, hoping, among the numerous Crowd, to find &s;ome Souls Great enough to protect her again&s;t the Carping Malice of the Vulgar World; who think it a proof of their Sen&s;e, to di&s;like every thing that is writ by Women. I was the more induc'd to this General Application, from the U&s;age I have met on all &s;ides.</P>
<P>A Play &s;ecretly introduc'd to the Hou&s;e, whil&s;t the Au|thor remains unknown, is approv'd by every Body: The Actors cry it up, and are in expectation of a great Run; the Book&s;eller of a Second Edition, and the Scribler of a Sixth Night: But if by chance the Plot's di&s;cover'd, and the Brat found Fatherle&s;s, immediately it flags in the Opini|on of tho&s;e that extoll'd it before, and the Book&s;eller falls in his Price, with this Rea&s;on only, <HI>It is a Woman's.</HI> Thus they alter their Judgment, by the E&s;teem they have for the Author, tho' the Play is &s;till the &s;ame. They ne'er re|flect, that we have had &s;ome Male-Productions of this kind, void of Plot and Wit, and full as in&s;ipid as ever a Wo|man's of us all.</P>
<P>I can't forbear in&s;erting a Story which my Book&s;eller, that printed my <HI>Game&s;ter,</HI> told me, of a Spark that had &s;een my <HI>Game&s;ter</HI> three or four times, and lik'd it extremely: Having bought one of the Books, ask'd who the Author was; and be|ing told, a Woman, threw down the Book, and put up his Money, &s;aying, he had &s;pent too much after it already, and was &s;ure if the Town had known that, it wou'd never have run ten days. No doubt this was a Wit in his own Eyes. It is &s;uch as the&s;e that rob us of that which in&s;pires the Poet, Prai&s;e. And it is &s;uch as the&s;e made him that Printed my Comedy call'd, <HI>Love's Contrivance;</HI> or, <HI>Medin</HI>
<PB REF="3">
<HI>cin Malgre lui,</HI> put two Letters of a wrong Name to it; which tho' it was the height of Inju&s;tice to me, yet his impo&s;ing on the Town turn'd to account with him; and thus pa&s;&s;ing for a Man's, it has been play'd at lea&s;t a hun|dred times.</P>
<P>And why this Wrath again&s;t the Womens Works? Per|haps you'll an&s;wer, becau&s;e they meddle with things out of their Sphere: But I &s;ay, no; for &s;ince the Poet is born, why not a Woman as well as a Man? Not that I wou'd derogate from tho&s;e great Men who have a Genius, and Learning to improve that Genius: I only object again&s;t tho&s;e ill-natur'd Criticks, who wanting both, think they have a &s;ufficient claim to Sen&s;e, by railing at what they don't under&s;tand. Some have arm'd them&s;elves with re|&s;olution not to like the Play they paid to &s;ee; and if in &s;pite of Spleen they have been pleas'd again&s;t their Will, have maliciou&s;ly reported it was none of mine, but given me by &s;ome Gentleman: Nay, even my own Sex, which &s;hou'd a&s;&s;ert our Prerogative again&s;t &s;uch Detractors, are often backward to encourage a Female Pen.</P>
<P>Wou'd the&s;e profe&s;t Enemies but con&s;ider what Examples we have had of Women that excell'd in all Arts; in Mu&s;ick, Painting, Poetry; al&s;o in War: Nay, to our immortal Prai&s;e, what Empre&s;&s;es and Queens have fill'd the World? What cannot <HI>England</HI> boa&s;t from Women? The mighty <HI>Romans</HI> felt the Power of <HI>Boadicea</HI>'s Arm; <HI>Eliza</HI> made <HI>Spain</HI> trem|ble; but <HI>ANN,</HI> the greate&s;t of the Three, has &s;hook the Man that aim'd at Univer&s;al Sway. After naming this Mi|racle, the Glory of our Sex, &s;ure none will &s;pitefully cavil at the following Scenes, purely becau&s;e a Woman writ'em. This I dare venture to &s;ay in their behalf, there is a Plot and Story in them, I hope will entertain the Reader; which is the utmo&s;t Ambition of,</P>

<P>AS I was &s;aying, Sir, I have advanc'd the Expences of our Summers Expedition from <HI>Ep&s;om</HI> to <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> from <HI>Tun|bridge</HI> to the <HI>Bath,</HI> and from thence to <HI>London</HI> here; where in&s;tead of Board-wages, I have liv'd upon Hopes that &s;ome of the&s;e Places wou'd furni&s;h you with a Bubble, and me with my Money; but I &s;ee no appearance of it: Therefore pray let you and I di&s;|count.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Equi.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir; the Affront you put upon me at <HI>Tun|bridge</HI> I can't forget, when you had lo&s;t fifty Guineas to the Knight upon Honour, and pretended you had &s;ent

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou know'&s;t I had no other quibble to avoid paying the Debt, and quitting the Place with Honour: Come, don't reflect upon my Misfortune; we have &s;een better Summers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Equi.</SPEAKER>
<P>In troth, Sir, I thought <HI>Bath</HI> promis'd well; I am &s;ure 'twas very full of Company; and if you had not fallen in Love, you might have paid me out of the Sub&s;cription.</P>

<P>How mu&s;t I have liv'd like a Gentleman then, Sirrah? I &s;hall break your Head.</P>

<P>I have done upon that Subject, Sir; I only de&s;ire my Di&s;charge and Wages; that's all.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you know what you ask, <HI>Equipage?</HI> A Game&s;ter and a Soldier are both Sons of Fortune; now to quit my Service, is directly to embroil your &s;elf with Fortune.</P>

<P>Ha, ha, for&s;ake the World!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Equi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, I have lately made &s;ome moral Reflecti|ons on the Uncertainty of worldly Plea&s;ures. I am weary of being well beaten, and ill fed; of pa&s;&s;ing the Night at a Tavern Door, and the Day in carrying Me&s;&s;ages from one Mi&s;s to another. In &s;hort, Sir, I am weary of the &s;ub&s;ervient Title, without the &s;ub&s;ervient Money, and re&s;olve to marry; that is, when I can find a Woman that de&s;erves me.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Equi.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it is, Sir; but this Digre&s;&s;ion makes you for|get that there is a &s;mall Rule in Arithmetick to be adju&s;t|ed. I have &s;erv'd you the&s;e eight Years at twenty-five

<P>Faith, 'tis a kind of intricate Story, but you mu&s;t be &s;atisfied. I have been bred a Soldier of Fortune, and am to this Day ignorant who my Parents were.

<P>This Story &s;eems Romantick&mdash;</P>

<P>You'll think it &s;o before I have done: Being land|ed, and travelling with my Servant towards <HI>London,</HI> I lo&s;t my way; Night came on; when, at a di&s;tance, we di&s;co|vered Lights and made up to 'em.

<P>Quite contrary: His generous Carriage has oblig'd me to &s;wear to him, never to attempt to marry her, if &s;he &s;hould con&s;ent without his leave, which he &s;eems &s;till a|ver&s;e to. I confe&s;s I love her beyond the re&s;t of her Sex, except one I &s;aw thro' a Grate in <HI>France,</HI> that I could ne|ver hear of &s;ince: yet this re&s;traint keeps me from pre&s;&s;ing my Suit for Marriage, and I have too much re&s;pect to at|tempt the other.</P>

<P>That's another Injunction of the old Gentle|man's, to procure the Writings of an E&s;tate out of her Hands, that her Husband cheated a Relation of his of.

<P>There can be none with a Prince that aims at univer&s;al Monarchy. But &s;etting Love apart, la&s;t Night after you left us, there came a Fellow into the Chocolate-Hou&s;e, who pretended he had made a Campaign in the Nature of a Voluntier; and among&s;t a number of palpable
