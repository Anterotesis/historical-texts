<DIV1 TYPE="articles of charge">
<P>MR. FRANCIS. I flattered my&s;elf, Sir, that when the Hou&s;e thought proper to ex|clude me from the Committee of Managers appointed to conduct the impeachment of Mr. Ha&s;tings, whether that re&s;olution was meant to be a di&s;charge from a &s;ervice, or a relief
<PB N="2" REF="4">
from a duty, it would have this effect at all events&mdash;that, from thenceforward, I &s;hould be &s;uffered to remain in a &s;tate of neutrality; and that, as I was deprived of the honour, I &s;hould be exempted from the cares and cen&s;ures, to which the Managers of an Impeachment mu&s;t unavoidably &s;ubmit. But much more had I rea&s;on to expect that, after the public declara|tion which I made in Parliament two years ago<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the &s;eventh of March, 1786.</NOTE>, <HI>that I would never fit in judgement on Sir Elijah Impey; and that I would never give a ju|dicial vote in any cau&s;e, in which he might be a party, unle&s;s I could &s;afely give it for him</HI>;&mdash;hav|ing publicly avowed that declaration in print, having &s;ince repeatedly declared to my friends, particularly to the honourable Baronet <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sir Gilbert Elliot.</NOTE> near me, that I would take no part in the pro&s;ecu|tion of Sir Elijah Impey, and having &s;trictly adhered to the &s;pirit of the&s;e declarations, I &s;hould not be implicated, in any &s;hape, in the impeachment of that gentleman. Lea&s;t of all did I expect, that I &s;hould be accu&s;ed by him of having borne te&s;timony to his good conduct, and compelled by him to an&s;wer, as a criminal,
<PB N="3" REF="5">
for declarations, which he tells you I have here|tofore made in his favour. I do not mean to deny his right of mixing accu&s;ation with de|fence, if to criminate others be in any degree material, or even u&s;eful to his own exculpation. In &s;ome ca&s;es undoubtedly, the weapons of at|tack are the be&s;t, perhaps the only in&s;truments of defence. Whether the u&s;e he has made of the&s;e weapons, and the manner, in which he has availed him&s;elf of his undi&s;puted right on this occa&s;ion, be perfectly prudent or not, can only be determined by the event. All I con|tend for is, that <HI>I,</HI> in my turn, may be allowed the &s;ame latitude which <HI>he</HI> has taken, and which <HI>I</HI> allow him. It is not my direct object this day to criminate him, or any man; but it <HI>may</HI> be nece&s;&s;ary to my defence. It may be unavoidable. Defence and accu&s;ation, in this particular ca&s;e, may be in&s;eparable. If that &s;hould happen, I de&s;ire it may be remembered, that, be&s;ides the general right of attack which, for my&s;elf, I admit to belong to him and to every defendant, I appeal to the &s;pecific u&s;e, which he has made of it, and follow the pre|cedent, which he has him&s;elf &s;pecifically &s;et me.</P>
<P>On &s;ome late occa&s;ions, my &s;ituation, in this Hou&s;e, has been equally painful and invidious.
<PB N="4" REF="6">
I have been repeatedly marked as the per&s;onal object of debate,&mdash;the middle pa&s;sive &s;ubject between the action and reaction of the powers of the Hou&s;e, between the hammer and the anvil. If any man thinks there is any thing delightful or agreeable in &s;uch a di&s;tinction, I am &s;ure his opinion is not founded on experi|ence. I &s;tand here, now, defendant again&s;t Sir Elijah Impey. In that character at lea&s;t, I hope to be heard with patience and a liberal con&s;truction. I de&s;ire no more.</P>
<P>The charge produced by this gentleman again&s;t Sir John Clavering, Colonel Mon&s;on, and my&s;elf, as I under&s;tood it, and as preci&s;ely as I have been able to collect it from my notes and memory, was, in real amount and &s;ub|&s;tance, to this effect. It is his own fault if I do not &s;tate it correctly.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That whereas we had, by &s;undry decla|rations and minutes, both before and after the event, expre&s;&s;ed, or &s;trongly intimated our opinion, that the pro&s;ecution, trial, and execution of Nundcomar, were founded on political motives, and pur&s;ued for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of &s;aving Mr. Ha&s;tings from the effect of that man's evidence; no credit
<PB N="5" REF="7">
ought to be given to the &s;ame, becau&s;e we had, in a few days after the execution, or|dered a paper, purporting to be a petition from Nundcomar again&s;t the Judges, to be burnt, the entries of it to be expun|ged, and the tran&s;lations to be de&s;troyed; and, becau&s;e I had, on that occa&s;ion, decla|red, that I con&s;idered the in&s;inuations con|tained in it as wholly un&s;upported, and of a libellous nature, and that to &s;end a copy of it to the Judges, would be giving it much more weight than it de&s;erved."</Q></P>
<P>If this be the charge, I admit the premi&s;es, and I deny the conclu&s;ion. If it be <HI>not</HI> the charge, I &s;hall pau&s;e for a moment, and wait to be informed, <HI>What is it?</HI>&mdash;No man, I think, will &s;ay, that I have weakened or under&s;tated it. For my&s;elf, I declare that I am not able to conceive, how it can be expre&s;&s;ed in &s;trong|er terms again&s;t the parties accu&s;ed. If ne|verthele&s;s it &s;hould be contended, that the terms I have made u&s;e of are loo&s;e or defec|tive, or that I have not done perfect ju&s;tice to Sir Elijah Impey's meaning and intention, let it be remembered, Sir, that he has not deli|vered his accu&s;ation in writing, as I had a &s;trict unque&s;tionable right to expect. No|thing
<PB N="6" REF="8">
that may be urged to ju&s;tify his with|holding the remainder of his defence, can be applied to that part of it, in which others are accu&s;ed. It might be very prudent in him; it might be e&s;&s;ential to his &s;afety, not to put his accu&s;ers in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his defence. Be it &s;o. In that re&s;pect, he is at liberty to act as he thinks proper; though I believe his refu&s;al to produce his defence, in the only form in which it could be fairly canva&s;&s;ed, or even compared with the written accu&s;ation, will not be re|ceived as a &s;trong pre&s;umptive proof even of his own confidence in the merits of his cau&s;e. My demand is a demand of right. It is not to oblige him to produce his defence, but to produce his accu&s;ation. Before I proceed, Sir, to the refutation of the charge, as I have &s;tated it, the exactne&s;s of which, I perceive, is not di&s;puted, I mu&s;t call the attention of the Committee to two preliminary con&s;iderati|ons, and reque&s;t that gentlemen will carry them in their minds during the &s;ub&s;equent di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion. They will throw a light on the gene|ral que&s;tion, and, I believe, be found very material to a thorough under&s;tanding of the whole tran&s;action. I mean &s;imply to &s;tate them now, and to re&s;erve the application of them for
<PB N="7" REF="9">
another part of my defence.&mdash;The fir&s;t relates to the manner, in which the paper in que&s;tion, came into Sir Elijah Impey's hands; the dif|ficulties, which were to be &s;urmounted be|fore he could be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; and the probable truth or fal&s;ehood of his a&s;&s;ertion, that he never knew what the charges were, which Nundcomar had produced again&s;t Mr. Ha&s;tings. I &s;hall recapitulate the facts to you briefly as they appear on the records, or as they have been &s;tated by Sir Elijah Impey.</P>
<P>The Rajah Nundcomar was executed on the 5th of Augu&s;t, 1775. On the 14th, General Clavering brought the petition, which was af|terwards burnt, before the Governor General and Council, in their &s;ecret department. It was produced and read; but I conclude, that the tran&s;lation, which the General brought with him, was not relied on, becau&s;e I find the next &s;ecret con&s;ultation, of the 16th, begins with the following words<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Bengal Appendix page, 585.</NOTE>:&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Per&s;ian tran&s;lator &s;ends in a <HI>corrected</HI> tran&s;lation of the petition of the late Maha Raja Nundcomar, delivered in by General Clavering."</Q>&mdash;Mr. Ha&s;tings immediately moved that, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"as this
<PB N="8" REF="10">
petition contained expre&s;sions reflecting upon the characters of the chief Ju&s;tice and Judges of the Supreme Court, a copy of it might be &s;ent them."</Q> I objected to that propo&s;al, and moved, that orders &s;hould be given to the Sheriff, to cau&s;e the original to be burned publicly by the hands of the common hangman;&mdash;a &s;ingular &s;tep, Sir, and on the face of our proceedings utterly unaccountable. Mr. Ha&s;tings repeatedly &s;aid, that he did not object to that motion; but he ob&s;erved that it would not be effectual, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"as the petition &s;tood on our own records, through which it would find its way to the Court of Direc|tors, to his Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;ters, and in all probability become public to the whole peo|ple of Britain."</Q> Admitting the force of the ob&s;ervation, I propo&s;ed that <HI>the entry of the addre&s;s from Rajah Nundcomar &s;hould be expunged.</HI> On this motion, the <HI>unanimous</HI> re&s;olution of the board &s;tands in the following words&mdash;AGREED, <HI>that it be expunged accordingly; and that the tran&s;|lations be de&s;troyed.</HI> To this re&s;olution Mr. Ha&s;tings was a party, not only as a Member of the Council, legally bound and concluded by the &s;en&s;e of the majority, but by his own ex|pre&s;s con&s;ent and agreement.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11">On the 28th of Augu&s;t the Judges wrote to us in the following words<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 586.</NOTE>:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A paper, containing a fal&s;e, &s;candalous, and malicious charge again&s;t the Judges of the Supreme Court, produced at your Board, having been by you declared a libel, and ordered to be burnt by the hands of the common hangman, we return you our thanks for having &s;hewn &s;o due a &s;en&s;e of this outrage to public ju&s;tice; but, as we mu&s;t be intere&s;ted as well in the Minutes introducing and condemning the paper, as in the paper it&s;elf, we find our&s;elves obliged to de&s;ire that you will furni&s;h us with a co|py of the libel, and of &s;uch Minutes, which relate to it, as &s;tand on your con&s;ultations, and mu&s;t therefore be conveyed to England, that we may judge whether they contain any matters NECESSARY FOR US TO TAKE NO|TICE OF."</Q></P>
<P>In our reply, dated 11th September, we &s;aid<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 589.</NOTE>, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We &s;hall be much obliged to you, if you will be plea&s;ed to acquaint us, from whom you received the imperfect information

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We do not think our&s;elves at liberty to communicate to you the Minutes, which may have pa&s;&s;ed on the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, as &s;uch Minutes are drawn up &s;olely for the information of our &s;uperiors.

<PB N="11" REF="13">
knew that he had given, or intended to give a copy of that tran&s;lation to Sir Elijah Impey; and who not only did &s;o, but, as it now ap|pears, altered the tran&s;lation, made by the proper officer of government, in many places, with his own hand; and it is by this la&s;t ex|traordinary circum&s;tance that Sir Elijah Impey proves the authenticity of the paper, which he produces in his defence, namely, that it is al|tered, corrected, and interlined in Mr. Ha&s;|tings's hand-writing. Mr. Ha&s;tings, I know, did not agree to the letter, though he &s;igned it; his di&s;&s;ent is recorded in the following words:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I di&s;approve of the draught, becau&s;e I do not think the information imperfect, which was received by the Judges; becau&s;e it appears to me an incon&s;i&s;tency to &s;peak of a paper, which was expunged from the re|cords, and ordered to be publicly burnt by the common hangman, as a &s;ecret of &s;tate, which it was a breach of tru&s;t to divulge; and becau&s;e the letter is written <HI>in a &s;train of in&s;inuation,</HI> equally unbecoming the dignity of the Board, and deficient in the re&s;pect, which is due to the Judges of the Court, to whom it is addre&s;&s;ed."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="14">This di&s;&s;ent, you &s;ee, is &s;upported by every argument he could think of, except the true one. He does not tell us, that he him&s;elf had given the information; that he him&s;elf had kept a copy of the tran&s;lation; that he him&s;elf had corrected, and given it to Sir Elijah Impey. Had he a&s;&s;igned the true rea&s;on for his di&s;&s;ent, we mu&s;t have given a very different an&s;wer to the Judges. It would have been impo&s;&s;ible even for <HI>us</HI> to &s;ign &s;uch a letter as that, which we all &s;igned; much le&s;s could we have de&s;ired, or expected Mr. Ha&s;tings to put his name to it. It may be &s;aid perhaps, that he was bound by a provi&s;ion in the Act of Parliament, and by the forms of the Council, to &s;ign a letter re|&s;olved on by the majority, even again&s;t his opi|nion. That he was legally &s;o bound and con|cluded, I admit; but that in fact he &s;ubmit|ted to the law, I deny.

<P><PB N="14" REF="16">Sir Elijah Impey tells you, on another occa|&s;ion, and to &s;erve another material purpo&s;e, that he knew nothing of the contents of the charges of Nundcomar again&s;t Mr. Ha&s;tings. His words, as I wrote them down upon the in&s;tant, were; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I aver, that I did not know what they were. How &s;hould I? They were produced before a &s;ecret Council, and examined by a &s;ecret Committee, of which all the members, their clerks and &s;ecreta|ries, were <HI>&s;worn to &s;ecrecy.</HI>"</Q>&mdash;Now, Sir, ad|mitting it to be po&s;&s;ible, that Sir Elijah Impey might not know, from public report, the &s;pe|cific &s;ums &s;tated, or the particular facts and circum&s;tances charged by Nundcomar again&s;t Mr. Ha&s;tings, that admi&s;&s;ion will not avail him. You are called upon to believe, that Sir Elijah Impey, living in the clo&s;e&s;t connection and intimacy with Mr. Ha&s;tings, did not know what was known to every man in Calcutta; what was the univer&s;al &s;ubject of conver&s;a|tion there for many months together, namely, that Nundcomar had accu&s;ed Mr. Ha&s;tings of venality and corruption in his office. He did not know that this charge was laid before the Council on the 11th of March; that Nundco|mar had been examined before the Council;
<PB N="15" REF="17">
that, on the 20th of April, Nundcomar was &s;ummoned to appear before all the Judges, to an&s;wer to a charge of a con&s;piracy again&s;t Mr. Ha&s;tings; and that, having been acquitted and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed on that examination, he was, on the 6th of May, arre&s;ted, and committed to the common jail, by a warrant &s;igned by two of the Judges, upon a charge of forgery. The facts at lea&s;t were too public and too noto|rious not to be known to him. But we are to believe, that, knowing &s;uch facts, it never once occurred to him, that there could be any relation between the fir&s;t, and all that followed it. Being ignorant, as he a&s;&s;ures you, of the particulars of the charge again&s;t Mr. Ha&s;tings, he never once &s;u&s;pected that that act of Nund|comar could have been the motive of tho&s;e &s;ub&s;equent mea&s;ures, which were taken to de|&s;troy him. Any other man, I think, would have combined the circum&s;tances. In any other human mind, they mu&s;t have excited &s;ome degree of &s;u&s;picion. My Honourable Friend, I doubt not, will be able to &s;atisfy this Hou&s;e, in proper time, that the general fact, namely, that Nundcomar had brought a criminal charge again&s;t Mr. Ha&s;ting, and even the &s;pecial nature of that charge, were
<PB N="16" REF="18">
judicially known to Sir Elijah Impey long be|fore the execution. What I contend for, and in&s;i&s;t upon now, is, that it is a thing utterly incredible; that it is a belief, to which no hu|man credulity can extend, that Mr. Ha&s;tings, who, in the face of the mo&s;t &s;acred obliga|tion and engagement, thought him&s;elf at li|berty to communicate to Sir Elijah Impey the petition of Nundcomar, to give him a corrected tran&s;lation of it, and to furni&s;h him, as I &s;hall prove he did, with copies of our Minutes, directly arraigning the conduct of Sir Elijah Impey in the trial and execution of Nund|comar, &s;hould not have imparted to him the charges preferred again&s;t him&s;elf by Nundco|mar, which, though entered in the &s;ecret de|partment, were neither of a &s;ecret nature in them&s;elves, nor in fact a &s;ecret to any man in Calcutta.</P>
<P>The &s;econd preliminary ob&s;ervation, which I wi&s;h to impre&s;s on the minds of the Commit|tee, regards the di&s;tinction, which Sir Elijah Impey carefully makes, and &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ts on, between the paper it&s;elf, and our <HI>Minutes,</HI> upon the &s;ubject;&mdash;the fir&s;t he &s;aw; the &s;econd he never &s;aw, till very lately, when he ob|tained a copy of them from the India Hou&s;e.
<PB N="17" REF="19">
It is indeed not only material, but e&s;&s;ential to his defence, that he &s;hould per&s;uade you of the truth of this la&s;t a&s;&s;ertion. He well knew, though you are not aware of it, that, if he admitted that he had &s;een our Minutes of the 16th of Augu&s;t 1775, at any time before Ja|nuary 1776, he mu&s;t have convicted him&s;elf of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t fal&s;ehood and contradiction. I &s;hall &s;peak to that point pre&s;ently. But it &s;eems that he not only did not &s;ee them in the year 1775, but that he never &s;aw them a tall, <HI>till very lately.</HI> Now, Sir, I beg leave in the fir&s;t place to ob&s;erve, that the Minutes in que&s;tion, on the pre&s;ent production of which he profe&s;&s;es to place &s;o much reliance, have not been concealed from the world; have not been buried in ob&s;curity. The books, now before me, (called the Bengal Nar|rative and Appendix) mu&s;t have been print|ed by the Court of Directors in the year 1776, or 1777; I pre&s;ume &s;o, becau&s;e I had a copy of them, long before I left Bengal, in the cour&s;e of the year 1778, if not &s;ooner. There were other copies in Calcutta. They were read with avidity by every man in the &s;ettlement, who could procure a &s;ight of them. They contain not only our Minutes, but great
<PB N="18" REF="20">
part of our proceedings, and all our corre&s;|pondence with Sir Elijah Impey, on the &s;ub|ject of Nundcomar. To all other men, the contents mu&s;t have been an object of curio&s;ity at lea&s;t. I know they were &s;o. To <HI>him,</HI> in par|ticular, they were in the highe&s;t degree in|tere&s;ting and important. Yet the learned gen|tleman never &s;aw them in Bengal; the&s;e books it &s;eems, <HI>never</HI> fell into his hands! nay, you are to be believe that, among the number of per&s;ons, by whom they were unque&s;tionably peru&s;ed, he had no acquaintance, who might have told him that &s;uch a compilation, pub|li&s;hed by authority, and in which his name and conduct were &s;o often mentioned, exi&s;ted in Calcutta. He had no friend or well-wi&s;her, among that number, who might have waited on him, as &s;oon as he had read our Minutes, to congratulate him on the te&s;timony given, as you are told, by his enemies or opponents, in favour of his integrity, and to recommend tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages at lea&s;t to his immediate pe|ru&s;al. Believe it if you will; believe it if you can. Perhaps you may think that, having gone &s;o far, you have done enough, and that Sir Elijah Impey has no farther demand on your credulity. That learned gentle|man
<PB N="19" REF="21">
is not &s;o ea&s;ily &s;atisfied. It &s;eems, Sir, he knew the facts; he knew that we had or|dered a libel on the Supreme Court of Judica|ture to be burned, and that it was burned; he had &s;een the paper it&s;elf, and was in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of a copy of it, given him by Mr. Ha&s;t|ings; but he had never, <HI>never</HI> &s;een the Mi|nutes that related to it! Now, Sir, it is of it&s;elf an extraordinary circum&s;tance, that Mr. Ha&s;tings, who thought him&s;elf at liberty to give him the paper, in violation, as I think, of the laws of the Council, and of his own per|&s;onal agreement, &s;hould not have communi|cated to him tho&s;e Minutes, which make an e&s;&s;ential part of the tran&s;action, and which, if they were then &s;uppo&s;ed to mean what he tells you they &s;o clearly expre&s;s, were not only in|nocent of all offence to the Judges, but con|veyed a po&s;itive approbation of their conduct. Why &s;hould Mr. Ha&s;tings make &s;o partial a communication of our proceedings to Sir Eli|jah Impey?&mdash;Why &s;hould the Governor Gene|ral with-hold from the Chief Ju&s;tice the fair and rea&s;onable &s;atisfaction of knowing that we, his enemies, had borne te&s;timony to the recti|tude of his conduct, and vindicated his cha|racter from every a&s;per&s;ion, which might have
<PB N="20" REF="22">
been, or could be thrown upon it. I defy any man to &s;tate a principle of action that will ju&s;tify Mr. Ha&s;tings in doing the fir&s;t, and not doing the &s;econd; or a rational motive of any kind, to make it probable in fact, that he did the one and not the other. The a&s;&s;er|tion is, that Mr. Ha&s;tings did not communi|cate our Minutes on this occa&s;ion to Sir Elijah Impey. Why not?&mdash;perhaps he thought it unfair;&mdash;perhaps he thought it would have been a breach of tru&s;t and honour to his col|leagues.&mdash;Perhaps he made a di&s;tinction between the paper it&s;elf, which, as he &s;ays, <HI>having been ordered to be publickly burnt, could be no &s;ecret of &s;tate</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 589.</NOTE>, and the Minutes of the Council, given in &s;ecret debate and recorded for the &s;ole information of the Court of Directors. &mdash;In general, there might have been &s;omething, though in this ca&s;e there would have been no|thing in the di&s;tinction;&mdash;but in fact, did he make the di&s;tinction? I appeal to Sir Elijah Im|pey, and &s;hall leave it to him to an&s;wer the que&s;|tion. In his letter of the 20th of January 1776, in four or five months after the tran&s;action of which we are &s;peaking, he tells the Secretary of State, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Governor General has, within
<PB N="21" REF="23">

Some &s;eem more particularly levelled at <HI>me.</HI>"</Q> You have it then from un|que&s;tionable authority, that Mr. Ha&s;tings did communicate our Minutes to Sir Elijah Impey: &mdash;Minutes fraught with direct charges again&s;t him:&mdash;Minutes, which, as he, <HI>Impey,</HI> &s;ays, <HI>were intended to be kept &s;ecret; but the Governor General had at la&s;t thought, that they ought in ju&s;|tice to be communicated to him.</HI>&mdash;Did he &s;o? Then where was the ju&s;tice of Mr. Ha&s;tings, when he communicated to his learned friend tho&s;e &s;ecret Minutes of ours, which were fraught with charges again&s;t him, and did not commu|nicate to him tho&s;e other Minutes, in which, as this learned gentleman tells you, we had ex|pre&s;&s;ed a direct, unequivocal approbation of his conduct? was it a fair and honourable pro|ceeding to his colleagues? would it have been common ju&s;tice even to his enemies, to impart the one, and not the other, to the per&s;on, who was the &s;ubject of both; to impart to Sir Elijah
<PB N="22" REF="24">
Impey every thing that was likely to inflame him again&s;t us, and to withhold from his know|ledge what might have operated in his mind, as an antidote again&s;t that poi&s;on; namely, the &s;trong declarations which we are &s;tated to have made in his favour? was it ju&s;t to Sir E. I. to di&s;cover to him the charges, which we had written home again&s;t him, and not to fur|ni&s;h him with that clear, complete, and irre|&s;i&s;tible an&s;wer, which had e&s;caped or been ex|torted from us, by which the charges might not only have been refuted, but mu&s;t have been annihilated; I mean the direct te&s;timony and confe&s;&s;ion of his accu&s;ers? For my part, Sir, I acquit Mr. Ha&s;tings of acting &s;o un|ju&s;tly to all parties; to his friend, as well as to his foes. I acquit him of it, becau&s;e I am not able to conceive a rea&s;on, good or bad, why he &s;hould act in a manner at once &s;o unfair to his colleagues, and &s;o injurious to his friend. I have no doubt that he communica|ted <HI>all</HI> our Minutes to Sir Elijah Impey. In proper time, I &s;hall &s;hew you, for what rea&s;on the contrary is maintained by this learned gen|tleman.

<P>Now, Sir, if it be true that there is a mani|fe&s;t incon&s;i&s;tency, a palpable contradiction be|tween the&s;e declarations, and our intermediate proceedings on the 16th Augu&s;t, 1775, I have brought that incon&s;i&s;tency and contradiction plainly and di&s;tinctly into your view. I am &s;ure I can &s;atisfy the Committee that it does not exi&s;t. In the fir&s;t place, you will allow me to &s;ay that, &s;etting a&s;ide all con&s;ideration of mo|ral character, and claiming nothing in favour of General Clavering, Colonel Mon&s;on, and my&s;elf, but that we &s;hall not be taken for idiots, it is not very likely that, having re|peatedly charged the pro&s;ecution and execu|tion of Nundcomar again&s;t Sir Elijah Impey, as a political mea&s;ure of the mo&s;t atrocious kind; having &s;o often recorded that opinion on the proceedings of the Council, we &s;hould almo&s;t at the &s;ame moment, voluntarily, and
<PB N="31" REF="33">
without any apparent rea&s;on, deliberately con|tradict our&s;elves, and record our own condem|nation on the face of our proceedings. Is it a thing to be believed, that having advanced <HI>&s;uch</HI> a charge, we &s;hould &s;o lightly abandon it, and that, having abandoned, we &s;hould re|&s;ume and re-a&s;&s;ert it, without once attempting to reconcile or explain the incon&s;i&s;tency of our conduct, if the idea of that contradiction, which is now urged and in&s;i&s;ted on, had ever occurred to us? Is it likely that, while we were con|tending with Mr. Ha&s;tings for the good opi|nion of the Court of Directors, we &s;hould have placed our&s;elves before them in a point of view, which mu&s;t have utterly annihilated their confidence in us?&mdash;Sir, I affirm that, in fact, we did no &s;uch thing. The terms of <HI>my</HI> opinion of the contents of the paper, which I propo&s;ed &s;hould be de&s;troyed, are, I &s;ee, particularly relied on. I de&s;ire they may be &s;trictly examined. I &s;aid that to &s;end to the Judges a copy of Nundcomar's petition, would be giving it much more weight than it de&s;erved; that I con&s;idered the in&s;inuations contained in it again&s;t them as wholly un&s;up|ported, and of a libellous nature. I thought and &s;aid &s;o then. I think and &s;ay &s;o &s;till, in
<PB N="32" REF="34">
the extent and manner in which they were &s;tated in that paper. The per&s;on, in who&s;e name it appeared, was dead. He had, whe|ther ju&s;tly or unju&s;tly, legally or illegally, been convicted of a crime, and had &s;uffered an ignominious death. Even if he had been re&s;pited after conviction, his evidence would have been u&s;ele&s;s, for his credit was gone. A petition from &s;uch a per&s;on, accu&s;ing his Judges, could have no &s;ort of weight. It came before us without a re&s;pon&s;ible accu&s;er, without a proof, or evidence of any kind; I therefore &s;aid it was <HI>wholly un&s;upported.</HI> No man, I pre&s;ume, will deny that it was in &s;trict|ne&s;s of <HI>a libellous nature.</HI> I a&s;&s;erted then, as I a&s;&s;ert now, that it was a libel on the whole Court of Ju&s;tice, in the &s;trict and proper &s;en&s;e of the word. The dreadful charge contained in it, included <HI>all</HI> the Judges, concerning two of whom (Sir Robert Chambers and Mr. Hyde) we never had a &s;u&s;picion of the motives, which we attributed to Sir Elijah Impey, though I am far from acquitting them of all blame. Concerning another of the Judges, the late Mr. Lemai&s;tre, though we &s;aw him united in the clo&s;e&s;t intimacy with the Chief Ju&s;tice, and ready to &s;upport his opinions on all occa&s;ions,
<PB N="33" REF="35">
with a degree of zeal and pa&s;&s;ion which, how|ever &s;incere, was not to be excu&s;ed, yet in that, which con&s;titutes the deadly guilt of the tran&s;action, we never &s;u&s;pected him to be con|cerned;&mdash;in a confederacy I mean with Sir Eli|jah Impey to take off Nundcomar, in order to &s;ave Mr. Ha&s;tings from the effect of that man's evidence. We were bound therefore to treat the petition as an indi&s;criminate libel again&s;t a whole Court of Ju&s;tice. Is there any thing in that re&s;olution, or in the terms of my opi|nion, on which it was founded, that under any, I will not &s;ay fair and liberal, but under the mo&s;t rigorous con&s;truction, can be under|&s;tood to expre&s;s or &s;ignify that we thought the paper <HI>fal&s;e,</HI> as well as libellous of all the Judges? This is no new di&s;tinction, &s;et up by me to &s;erve the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. It is no af|ter thought, no <HI>ex po&s;t facto</HI> vindication of my conduct. I can prove to the Committee, that I always made the &s;ame di&s;tinction between an accu&s;ation and a libel. When Mr. Ha&s;tings accu&s;ed me per&s;onally, about three months be|fore, of pre&s;enting a libel again&s;t him to the Board, my an&s;wer to him &s;tands recorded in the following words:</P>

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Governor General, who had long ex|pected the appearance of &s;uch a letter, and was appri&s;ed of the contents of it, made no objection, however, to its being received and read at the Board. When the man, who advances a &s;pecific charge, declares him&s;elf ready to come forward and &s;upport it, and to hazard the con&s;equences of fail|ing in his proofs, it may &s;till indeed be pre|&s;umed that the charge is fal&s;e; but it does not partake of the nature of a libel. A li|beller advances charges, which he does not intend, or is unable to make good. When called upon to appear and produce his evi|dence, he &s;helters him&s;elf, &s;ometimes in the ob&s;curity, &s;ometimes in the &s;uperiority of his &s;ituation, and leaves the accu&s;ation with|out an accu&s;er, to operate as far as it can, in the opinions of men, again&s;t the honour and reputation of the party accu&s;ed. Rajah Nundcomar is not an ob&s;cure per&s;on in this country, nor does he in this in&s;tance act the part of a libeller. He is him&s;elf of very high rank; he publickly accu&s;es the Gover|nor

<P>This is my defence again&s;t the charge, as it affects us collectively on the face of our pro|ceedings; and I willingly &s;ubmit to your judg|ment, whether the avowed o&s;ten&s;ible rea&s;ons, publicly a&s;&s;igned by me, be not &s;ufficient to account for my public official conduct on the occa&s;ion, and to acquit me of the pre&s;ent charge of contradiction. But had I no other motives for what I did, beyond tho&s;e which I have a&s;&s;igned? Undoubtedly I had, and I am ready to declare them. Addre&s;&s;ing you, as I do, under an honourable and moral obligation, as powerful and coercive as any, that law or religion can impo&s;e upon the human mind, I &s;hould hold my&s;elf a perjured man, if called upon, as in effect I am, for the whole truth, I re&s;erved any part of it from your knowledge. My &s;ecret predominant motive for propo&s;ing to de&s;troy the original paper produced by Ge|neral Clavering, was to &s;ave <HI>him,</HI> and <HI>him</HI> alone, from the danger, to which he had expo&s;ed him|&s;elf by that ra&s;h incon&s;iderate action.

my own &s;ugge&s;tion.

Po&s;&s;ibly Mr. Barwell may recollect the circum&s;tance. He then &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I &s;uppo&s;e you &s;ee what the Governor means. If the Judges get po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the paper, Clavering may be ruined by it."</Q> My an&s;wer was, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why, what can they do to him?"</Q> To that he replied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I know not what they can do; but, &s;ince they have dipped their hands in blood, what is there they will not do?"</Q>&mdash; He then de&s;ired me to move that the original paper &s;hould be de&s;troyed by the hands of the common hangman. This &s;hort conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed very nearly, I firmly believe, if not preci&s;ely, in the terms in which I have related it. It is not po&s;&s;ible I &s;hould ever forget or mi&s;take the &s;ub&s;tance of it. If I am charged with having acted a feeble, pu&s;illanimous part, let it be remembered that my fears, whether well or ill founded, were not for my&s;elf; that the danger, whether real or imaginary, could

It was my opinion, however, and is &s;o at this hour, that the dan|ger to General Clavering was real and &s;erious. The author of the libel was dead. General Clavering had made him&s;elf the publi&s;her, and put him&s;elf into the power of his enemies. I cannot bring before you in evidence the &s;tate of the &s;ettlement at that time; the great power that was confederated again&s;t us, and the univer|&s;al combination of all ranks of Europeans to &s;up|port that power in all its operations. We were &s;ent out by Parliament to enquire into and to reform abu&s;es. The fir&s;t di&s;coveries, that came before us, gave a general alarm.

The period is too remote. The &s;cene is too di&s;tant. The in&s;tant impre&s;&s;ion upon <HI>our</HI> minds cannot ea&s;ily be communicated to yours. We knew we were &s;urrounded by the &s;nares of the law. We had no legal learn|ing. We had no legal advice. You may &s;peculate coolly and wi&s;ely upon our conduct; but you will not determine equitably, if you do not endeavour to place your&s;elves exactly in our &s;ituation. At all events, whether we did right or wrong, we certainly did not do that of which we are accu&s;ed. We never &s;aid, that the contents of Nundcomar's peti|tion were not true. As Mr. Ha&s;tings entirely agreed with us in every thing we did, I never had a doubt that the tran&s;lation was de&s;troyed, until Sir Elijah Impey produced a copy of it at the bar of this Hou&s;e. Of the authenticity of this tran&s;lation, you have no other evidence but that, which confe&s;&s;es it was obtained by means the mo&s;t unju&s;tifiable, by means, which prove, what we always &s;u&s;pected, that we were betrayed, by one of our own Board, to Sir Elijah Impey, and by means, which prove to demon&s;tration the collu&s;ion and confederacy, that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted from the fir&s;t between Sir Elijah Impey and Mr. Ha&s;tings. The exi&s;tence of
<PB N="40" REF="42">
that well-grounded &s;u&s;picion is material to our defence.</P>
<P>I am now to reply to that part of Sir Elijah Impey's accu&s;ation, which exclu&s;ively affects General Clavering. On my own account per|&s;onally, I have no manner of concern in it. I am here the unin&s;tructed advocate, the feeble defendant of an honourable friend, who is now no more. In <HI>his</HI> name, and for his cau&s;e, I claim and expect that indulgence, that favour and protection, which he, I am &s;ure, would never have &s;olicited for him&s;elf, but which is admitted to be due, and which this Hou&s;e, in fact, has liberally di&s;tributed to other defen|dants. The learned gentleman him&s;elf, when he appeared at your bar, was received there, as he ought to be, with favour and indulgence. He was received there, with what I believe is not quite &s;o common, though perhaps equally proper, with di&s;tingui&s;hed marks of protec|tion. But if indulgence, if favour and protec|tion are due to a per&s;on, who is pre&s;ent to de|fend him&s;elf, who is him&s;elf a man of great learning and experience, and who can at any time collect and command the united learning of his profe&s;&s;ion, and &s;ummon it to his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance: how much more are they due to a man
<PB N="41" REF="43">
of great character, who is not here to plead his own cau&s;e; who is not only ab&s;ent, but dead, and who died in the &s;ervice of his country. Not, indeed, in the field of battle, where his gallant mind would have led him, but in a vile, vexatious conte&s;t with men;&mdash;I will not attempt to qualify them;&mdash;General Clavering thought him&s;elf degraded by a conte&s;t with &s;uch men.</P>
<P>In this tran&s;action, I cannot undertake to an|&s;wer for all the motions of his conduct. I think I can for &s;ome of them. But a&s;&s;uredly, Sir, I &s;hall not attempt to explain what I never under&s;tood; that is, with what inten|tion, and for what po&s;&s;ible purpo&s;e, he brought the paper before the Board. Neither is that que&s;tion material at pre&s;ent. The que&s;tionable words in his Minute of the 14th of Augu&s;t, 1775, when he produced the Petition of Nundcomar, are the&s;e: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As I imagined that the Paper might contain &s;ome reque&s;t that I &s;hould take &s;ome &s;teps to intercede for him, and being re&s;olved not to make any applications whatever in his favour, I left the Paper on my table till the 6th, which was the day after his execution, when I ordered it to be tran&s;lated by my interpre|ter."</Q>&mdash;On this proceeding, the que&s;tion is
<PB N="42" REF="44">
too obvious not to occur in&s;tantly to every man who hears me, <HI>why had he re&s;olved not to make any application whatever in favour of Nundcomar?</HI></P>
<P>In attempting to account for an act done by another, &s;o many years ago, and to verify the motives of the per&s;on who did it; you will not expect that the evidence &s;hould amount to demon&s;tration. The be&s;t that I can offer you, and the utmo&s;t the ca&s;e will admit of, is &s;trong probability and fair con|jecture. The peculiar character and known principles of General Clavering mu&s;t be taken into the account. Remember that you are trying a cau&s;e of honour in a Court of Honour, in the <HI>forum con&s;cientiae,</HI> which exi&s;ts in the heart of every honourable man, not in a Court of Law. You cannot fairly pronounce upon the man, without knowing and con&s;idering the general principles of his life. Now, Sir, I affirm of General Clavering, what I believe will not be di&s;puted by any per&s;on who knew him, that his moral mind and character were &s;trictly and &s;everely upright; that he determined every que&s;tion that came before him with ri|gid ju&s;tice; that his delicacy, in every thing that appeared to him to touch his honour, was more than &s;crupulous, and bordered, if po&s;|&s;ible,
<PB N="43" REF="45">
upon exce&s;s. I have &s;ometimes told him &s;o, when I have &s;een him refu&s;e little complimentary pre&s;ents of fruit, or flowers, &s;ent to his family, and order them to be re|turned.&mdash;He was a man very tender of public reputation; very fearful of reproach; and, particularly fearful of the imputation of &s;up|porting and encouraging the accu&s;er of Mr. Ha&s;tings. With the&s;e principles, he might po&s;&s;ibly think that it did not become him to intercede for a man found guilty of a capital offence. But it is much more probable, and more material to his pre&s;ent vindication, that he was well convinced his interce&s;&s;ion would do mi&s;chief in&s;tead of good, and would rather ha&s;ten than retard the execution of Nundco|mar. Mr. Farrer tells you in his evidence<NOTE PLACE="foot">Page 22.</NOTE>, that when he propo&s;ed to the General to re|ceive and tran&s;mit to the Judges, a Petition of Nundcomar addre&s;&s;ed to the Governor Ge|neral and Council, his an&s;wer ended with the&s;e words, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"nor indeed did he think it would do any good."</Q> That he had &s;olid and &s;ufficient rea&s;on for entertaining that opinion, I believe I can demon&s;trate. Many gentlemen, I dare &s;ay, who heard Sir Elijah Impey's fugitive de|fence
<PB N="44" REF="46">
at the Bar, went away with an impre&s;|&s;ion, that General Clavering, Colonel Mon|&s;on and I, never took any formal &s;teps in favour of Nundcomar; and that if we had interceded for him, it might probably have &s;aved his life. Whether the Judges would or would not have yielded to our interce&s;&s;ion, is a que&s;|tion, which no human tribunal can decide. You may form a judgment of it, however, by ob&s;erving how the Court acted, when we really did intercede with them in favour of Nundcomar, in in&s;tances of no importance to the real purpo&s;es of ju&s;tice, though very im|portant to the unfortunate man him&s;elf. I &s;hall &s;tate the facts I allude to, in the terms in which they are recorded.</P>
<P>On the 8th of May, 1775,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 552.</NOTE> a Petition was received from Rajah Nundcomar to the Go|vernor General and Council, which, after &s;tating many other particulars, very de&s;erv|ing of the attention of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, concludes with the following words,&mdash; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Honourable Pre&s;ident, I am well a&s;|&s;ured, is fully &s;en&s;ible of the facts I allude to;&mdash;It may be requi&s;ite to explain to the re&s;t of the Honourable Members of the

Nothing of this can be performed in the place where I now am; and, could even the&s;e ob&s;tacles be &s;urmounted, the place it&s;elf, as being in|habited by men of a different religion, would prevent my receiving any &s;u&s;tenance without breaking tho&s;e rules, which I have hitherto religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved. I therefore humbly reque&s;t, that I may be permitted to re&s;ide, under as &s;trict a guard as may be judged requi&s;ite, in &s;ome place where the&s;e objections may be obviated."</Q></P>
<P>After a long and careful examination made by the Board into the truth of this re|pre&s;entation, I moved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 557.</NOTE>, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the Sheriff and his Deputy &s;hould be directed to wait on the Chief Ju&s;tice, on the part of the Board, to repre&s;ent to him the &s;ituation of the Rajah Nundcomar, who&s;e religion, as he had informed the Board, had obliged him to deny him&s;elf &s;u&s;tenance in the par|ticular circum&s;tances of his pre&s;ent con|finement;

<PB N="47" REF="49">
will, and can only be obtained from prin|ciples of ju&s;tice, may have the appearance of being obtained by the means of influence and authority, the peculiar turn of mind of the natives being to expect every thing from power, and little from ju&s;tice."</Q></P>
<P>In another letter, dated May 15, 1775, he &s;ays <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 564.</NOTE>:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I did not, nor do not que&s;tion the autho|rity of the Board in receiving Petitions; I carefully re&s;tricted what I &s;aid <HI>to this indivi|dual Pri&s;oner</HI>; I did not de&s;ire his Petitions &s;hould not be received; but, when received, if they were to require any thing from the Judges or the Court, that the an&s;wers given to tho&s;e Petitions &s;hould be, that he mu&s;t apply him&s;elf directly to the Judges; and this I did to avoid the imputation I then alluded to, and which would be equally de|rogatory to the character of the Council, as that of the Judges.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The particular rea&s;on, which called upon me in this ca&s;e, to make that requi&s;ition, was the reports publicly circulated in this town, that, if the Judges could not be pre|vailed

<P>This &s;uppo&s;ed report of an intention in the Commander in Chief and two of the Council, to relea&s;e the Pri&s;oner <HI>manu forti,</HI> was not in|con&s;iderately advanced or abandoned by the learned Gentleman.

I leave it to him to recon|cile an imputation of &s;uch a nature, if he can, to that high approbation, with which he &s;ays
<PB N="49" REF="51">
we afterwards received the execution of Nund|comar. But, in what light did General Cla|vering con&s;ider it? Sir, the imputation of a de&s;ign to re&s;i&s;t the Civil Power, to oppo&s;e the Execution of Ju&s;tice, appeared to him not only &s;o &s;candalous, but &s;o dangerous, &s;o par|ticularly levelled at <HI>him,</HI> as a Military Man, as Commander in Chief of the Army, that he thought it nece&s;&s;ary, for his &s;afety, to ex|culpate him&s;elf from it by oath <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 565.</NOTE>.

<P>Now, Sir, it is proper you &s;hould know, that the&s;e pundits, in point of circum&s;tances and &s;ituation, were very low and indigent per|&s;ons; that they received &s;mall &s;alaries for their attendance on the Supreme Court, and were removeable at the plea&s;ure of the Judges. Admitting neverthele&s;s that, in this &s;tate of dependance, they might have had courage enough to deliver an opinion adver&s;e to the ap|parent inclination of the Chief Ju&s;tice, on whom they depended, and that the opinion, which they did deliver, was &s;incere, it ought not to have prevailed with Sir Elijah Impey again&s;t what he &s;aw was the internal conviction of Nundcomar, demon&s;trated by a determina|tion to die, rather than &s;ave his life by &s;ub|mitting to pollution.

The Bramin of a lower cla&s;s is no judge even of the ceremonies, much le&s;s of the religious &s;cruples of a &s;uperior Bramin.

<P>Want of food was not the only di&s;tre&s;s, to which this unfortunate man was obliged to &s;ubmit.

Mr. Naylor, the Company's Attor|ney, committed by Sir Elijah Impey for a contempt of the Court, in not an&s;wering inter|rogatories, died in con&s;equence of being &s;hut
<PB N="60" REF="62">
up there a few weeks. Others, to <HI>my</HI> know|ledge, have &s;uffered by it &s;everely.</P>
<P>In &s;uch a pri&s;on, we knew that Nundcomar was peri&s;hing for want of food.&mdash;That we felt the mo&s;t &s;erious anxiety for his &s;ituation, Sir Elijah Impey may affect to doubt, if he thinks proper. That General Clavering &s;ent con|&s;tantly to enquire about his health, is charged and admitted. But, in this offence, he had accomplices, it &s;eems, whom Sir Elijah Im|pey has thought it perfectly proper and be|coming in him to include in the charge. For the &s;ake of calumniating the memory of Sir John Clavering, he brings <HI>the ladies of his family</HI> into public notice, into the judicial view of the Hou&s;e of Commons. Sir John Cla|vering's daughters are accu&s;ed of &s;ending every day to the pri&s;on with compliments to the Rajah, and inquiries about his health. One would think that, even if there had been any thing improper in what they did, the con&s;i|deration due to their &s;ex and youth, to their beauty and accompli&s;hments, might have pro|tected them from &s;o ungenerous an allu&s;ion to their names and conduct. But it is in the ex|erci&s;e of their charity, in the di&s;play of that benevolent virtue, which gives new lu&s;tre to
<PB N="61" REF="63">
youth and beauty;&mdash;it is in the performance of the mo&s;t amiable of all human duties, that the daughters of General Clavering are intro|duced to be evidence again&s;t their father, and even Lady Clavering again&s;t her hu&s;band. The charge means nothing, if it be not in|tended to convey, that General Clavering had &s;ome improper connection and corre&s;pondence with the accu&s;er of Mr. Ha&s;tings. Without that application, the mention of the ladies of his family would be mere malice, and nothing el&s;e. But, why not accu&s;e <HI>me</HI> too of the &s;ame offence? I was at lea&s;t as guilty of it as they. I &s;ent me&s;&s;ages every day to Nundcomar. If, knowing his &s;ituation &s;o exactly as I did from the Sheriff, I had neglected him at &s;uch a time, I mu&s;t have lo&s;t all &s;en&s;e of humanity. For the &s;ame &s;ort of purpo&s;e, we are accu&s;ed of having paid a vi&s;it of ceremony to Rajah Nundcomar. I an&s;wer it by a&s;king, <HI>why &s;hould we not?</HI> He was a per&s;on of the fir&s;t rank in his own country.&mdash;He belonged to the high|e&s;t order of the Bramins.&mdash;I believe he was their Chief.&mdash;He had been Prime Mini&s;ter of the Government under Meer Jaffier, and his &s;on. Was &s;uch a man not intitled to a vi&s;it from General Clavering, Colonel Mon&s;on and
<PB N="62" REF="64">
<HI>me?</HI>&mdash;In point of rank, he was far &s;uperior to any of us. But, what was the fact?&mdash;On the day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">20th April, 1775.</NOTE>, after he was examined before the Judges, at Sir Elijah Impey's hou&s;e, on a charge of a pretended con&s;piracy again&s;t Mr. Ha&s;tings, when the charge was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and when his accu&s;ers were not even bound over to pro&s;ecute, we paid him a &s;hort vi&s;it at his hou&s;e. I am &s;ure it did not exceed ten minutes. We &s;aw plainly enough for what rea&s;on he was per&s;ecuted, and we thought it became us to pay him that compliment, as a public mark of countenance and good opinion. We did not promi&s;e him protection, for unfortunately we had no power to protect him.</P>
<P>I have given you now an exact and faithful account of a tran&s;action, which, I think, Sir Elijah Impey would never have appealed to, if he had not been blinded by a guilty mind. He flattered him&s;elf that he had contrived to make it impo&s;&s;ible to detect the fal&s;ehood of his &s;tory. I believe you are &s;atisfied, that he was, from the fir&s;t, united in clo&s;e collu&s;ion with Mr. Ha&s;tings; that we were not mi&s;taken in &s;u&s;pecting, that our &s;ecret debates in Council were betrayed to
<PB N="63" REF="65">
him;&mdash;that our ordering Nundcomar's petition to be burned, was founded on an apprehen&s;ion materially connected with that &s;u&s;picion;&mdash; that, by that re&s;olution, we never meant to pronounce upon the &s;ub&s;tance or merits of the petition; and that the learned gentleman him|&s;elf never once thought of giving the con&s;truc|tion to what we &s;aid, or of drawing the con|clu&s;ion from what we did, which he now ad|vances, for the fir&s;t time, almo&s;t thirteen years after the event. If, on this la&s;t material point, there be yet a doubt in the mind of any man, I can remove it by the be&s;t of all evidence, by that at lea&s;t, which u&s;ually makes the deep|e&s;t impre&s;&s;ion,&mdash;by the evidence of the party again&s;t him&s;elf. Sir Elijah Impey's letter to the Secretary of State, dated the 20th of Jan|uary 1776, is now before me. It con&s;i&s;ts of &s;eventeen folio pages in print. It appears to have been written on purpo&s;e to vindicate his character from the a&s;per&s;ions <HI>uniformly</HI> thrown upon it, by Clavering, Mon&s;on, and Francis, for his conduct in the bu&s;ine&s;s of Nundcomar, to charge them with having <HI>con&s;tantly</HI> imputed to the Court the mo&s;t atrocious motives for their conduct, by &s;trong in&s;inuation, malignant &s;ar|ca&s;m, and &s;evere cen&s;ure; and to accu&s;e them of attempting, on &s;undry occa&s;ions, to over|awe,

<P>I agree with this learned gentleman intire|ly in the definition he has given of his crimes, as well as in his opinion of the puni&s;hment they de&s;erve. But I call upon him to explain to you, if he can, why, in January 1766, he looked forward to a <HI>future</HI> period for a <HI>future</HI> retractation of the charges we had &s;tated, of the fal&s;ehoods we had written again&s;t him, if it be true, as he now tells you, that we had already abandoned tho&s;e charges, if we had already acknowledged the fal&s;ehood of our a&s;&s;ertions, and borne a clear unque&s;tionable te&s;timony to the rectitude of his conduct. The di&s;tinction he endeavours to &s;ee up be|tween our <HI>Minutes,</HI> which he affirms he never &s;aw, and our public act in burning the paper, will be no relief to him. He &s;ays he never &s;aw our Minutes on the &s;ubject. Be it &s;o, the a&s;|&s;ertion is incredible;&mdash;but I abandon that que&s;tion. At the pre&s;ent moment, I do not de&s;ire you to believe what he denies, but only
<PB N="66" REF="68">
to remember, what he has admitted. He was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the paper, and knew that we had ordered it to be de&s;troyed. If he had re|ally conceived that, by that re&s;olution, we meant to expre&s;s or imply an opinion of the <HI>fal&s;ehood</HI> of the contents, he ought to have concluded from it then, as he pretends to do now, that we our&s;elves had acquitted him, by a public voluntary act of our own, of all the atro|cious charges we had brought again&s;t him. In that &s;en&s;e, if the act in que&s;tion was any proof at all, it was full as good a proof of our favourable opinion of him, as any thing we could have &s;aid in our Minutes upon the &s;ub|ject.&mdash;In this long letter he never mentions or alludes to either one or the other. Yet that was the time, if ever, for him to have availed him&s;elf of the evidence of the per&s;ons he calls his enemies, again&s;t them&s;elves, and to invali|date any declarations they might have made again&s;t him on other occa&s;ions: in&s;tead of ap|pealing then to the recorded fact,&mdash;to what he now calls irre&s;i&s;tible evidence of our opi|nion in his favour, he expre&s;sly looks forward to a di&s;tant day, when he expects that we &s;hall be ready to condemn our&s;elves, when we &s;hall

in &s;tating to the Committee, that he had never, till very lately, &s;een our Minutes of the 16th of Augu&s;t 1775.</P>
<P>Had he admitted that he had &s;een the Minutes in Calcutta, his letter to the Secre|tary of State would, upon his pre&s;ent &s;hewing, have been a direct fal&s;ehood as a charge, and palpably defective as a defence. With tho&s;e Minutes before him, and under&s;tanding them in the &s;en&s;e of approbation or even of ac|quittal, he could not have &s;aid that we had <HI>univer&s;ally</HI> condemned the conduct of the Supreme Court. Much le&s;s, while he was defending him&s;elf again&s;t the mo&s;t atrocious imputations, particularly levelled at <HI>him,</HI> could he have omitted all mention of a fact &s;o material to his defence, &s;o irre&s;i&s;tible in its na|ture, as that we, who accu&s;ed, had com|pleatly acquitted him.</P>
<P>I do not mean to give the Committee any farther trouble. Either the charge, which this learned Gentleman has brought again&s;t Sir John Clavering, Colonel Mon&s;on and my|&s;elf, is an&s;wered, or it is not in my power to an&s;wer it. Had he acted with the &s;ame can|dour to <HI>me,</HI> which my honourable friend has ob&s;erved to <HI>him</HI>;&mdash;had he thought proper to

deliver it in writing, I would have an&s;wered it in writing. Let him deliver it even now upon paper, and I pledge my&s;elf to an&s;wer it in the &s;ame manner. Whether he does or no, it is my intention, though I do not ab|&s;olutely bind my&s;elf to do &s;o, to write down what I have &s;aid, and to offer it to the Com|mittee. Some way or other, I mean to put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my defence. If his cau&s;e be good, let him have all advantages in de|fending it.

Where the fir&s;t magi&s;trate declares his determined intention of hurting an indi|vidual to the utmo&s;t of his power, the enemies of the man &s;o marked for de&s;truction will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gerly gra&s;p at an opportunity of gratifying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eir malice; the di&s;&s;olute and abandoned will find a &s;ufficient inducement to per&s;ecute him from the hopes of gratifying the re&s;ent|ment of the man in power; and if the un|happy man, &s;o devoted, have, by an upright conduct, made the wicked his enemies, malice and wickedne&s;s may unite their endeavours to complete his ruin. To advance a &s;tep fur|ther, &s;hould the fir&s;t man in the State coun|tenance one <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mohunper&s;aud.</NOTE> publicly known to be de&s;titute of all moral principle, and as publicly known to be the enemy of the per&s;on, again&s;t whom he has denounced his re&s;entment: &s;hould he treat a man of &s;uch principles with a degree of di&s;tinction far above his rank in life:

&s;hould he admit him to private conferences with him, what is the wretched object of his re&s;entment to expect? where &s;hall he find an a&s;ylum, when the whole body of the wicked and abandoned is let loo&s;e upon him? I mean not now, however, to deprecate the Governor General's re&s;entment. The rea&s;ons of the encouragement afforded to my enemies, and the motives of the Governor General's re&s;entment again&s;t me, will be &s;ufficiently explained to the world by the repre&s;entation I have already made in a former addre&s;s to the Honourable Board.

is to introduce my reque&s;t, that I might not &s;uffer upon &s;uch a charge, from the ba&s;e accu&s;ation, a puni&s;hment equal to that of death,&mdash;the violation of the mo&s;t &s;acred duties of my religion. The Honourable Pre&s;ident, I am well a&s;&s;ured, is fully &s;en&s;ible of the facts I allude to. It may be requi&s;ite to explain to the re&s;t of the Honourable Members of the Board, that the in&s;titutions of our religion &s;trictly enjoin a number of ablutions, prayers, and other ceremonies to be performed by the Sect of Brahmins before they can take any kind of food. Nothing of this can be per|formed in the place where I now am; and could even the&s;e ob&s;tacles be &s;urmounted, the place it&s;elf, as being inhabited by men of a different religion, would prevent my re|ceiving any &s;u&s;tenance, without breaking tho&s;e rules, which I have hitherto religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved. I therefore humbly reque&s;t that I may be permitted to re&s;ide, under as &s;trict a guard as may be judged requi&s;ite, in &s;ome place where the&s;e objections may be ob|viated.</P>

<P>Mr. Naylor, who appears to have been a per&s;on of con&s;iderable indu&s;try and abilities, was employed by the Governor General and Council to defend that Board, and &s;ome per|&s;ons of di&s;tinction among the natives, again&s;t the late &s;uits in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court attached Mr. Naylor for a con|tempt, on account of &s;ome &s;teps he had taken, under the direction, and in favour of his clients; and, on his refu&s;al to an&s;wer a &s;eries of interrogatories, (in which refu&s;al he was &s;upported by his Clients) he was detained in the common goal at Calcutta, a mi&s;erable and pe&s;tilential place, upwards of a month. For the&s;e interrogatories, which your Committee conceive to be in many parts wholly unju&s;ti|fiable, they refer to their report of la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, and to the Co&s;&s;ijurah Appendix to that report.

<P>If &s;everal tran&s;actions of former times are to be tried by the Act lately tran&s;mitted from the King of Great Britain, it will occa&s;ion trouble and ruin to the inhabitants of this country. The affair of Maha Rajah Nundcomar, which is now before the Court, is really hard and rigorous; for, &s;hould the crime of which he is accu&s;ed, be proved again&s;t him in the &s;aid Court, the cu&s;tom of this country does not make it de&s;erving of capital puni&s;hment: nor, as I am informed, was life formerly forfeited for it in your country; that has only been common for a few years pa&s;t. The Maha Rajah has tran&s;acted affairs of the greate&s;t im|portance. When Meer Co&s;&s;im Ally Khan had taken the re&s;olution to ruin and expel the Engli&s;h, the Maha Rajah, in particular, exerted him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t, with my father, in &s;up|plying them with grain and money for the u&s;e
<PB N="83" REF="85">
of their troops. The &s;ervices of the Maha Rajah on this occa&s;ion are well known to the King of Hindo&s;tan; certainly he never could have committed &s;o contemptible a crime. People employed in important affairs will un|doubtedly have many enemies; and tho&s;e, who have been active in the affair of Nundcomar, have long been his declared foes. Taking therefore into con&s;ideration the welfare of the people, I beg in particular, with re&s;pect to this affair, that the Rajah's execution may be &s;u&s;pended till the plea&s;ure of his Maje&s;ty, the King of England, &s;hall be known.</P>

him this la&s;t mark of re&s;pect, and to a&s;&s;ure him that every attention &s;hould be given the next morning which could afford him comfort on &s;o melancholy an occa&s;ion; that I was deeply concerned that the duties of my office made me of nece&s;&s;ity a party in it, but that I would attend to the la&s;t, to &s;ee that every de&s;ire he had &s;hould be gratified; that his own pallan|keen and his own &s;ervants &s;hould attend him, and that &s;uch of his friends, who I under&s;tood were to be pre&s;ent, &s;hould be protected.

His compo&s;ure was wonderful; not a &s;igh e&s;caped him, nor the &s;malle&s;t alteration of
<PB N="95" REF="97">
voice or countenance, though I under&s;tood he had not many hours before taken a &s;olemn and affectonate leave of his &s;on-in-law Roy Radichurn. I found my&s;elf &s;o much &s;econd to him in firmne&s;s, that I could &s;tay no longer. Going down &s;tairs, the jailor informed me, that &s;ince the departure of his friends, he had been writing notes and looking at accounts in his u&s;ual way. I began now to apprehend that he had taken his re&s;olution, and fully expected that he would be found dead in the morning; but on Saturday the 5th, at &s;even, I was informed that every thing was in readi|ne&s;s at the goal for the execution. I came there about half an hour pa&s;t &s;even; the howlings and lamentations of the poor wretched people who were taking their la&s;t leave of him is not to be de&s;cribed. I have hardly recovered the fir&s;t &s;hock while I write this, above three hours afterwards. As &s;oon as he heard I was arrived, he came down into the yard, and joined me in the jailor's apart|ment. There was no lingering about him, no affected delay; he came chearfully into the room, made the u&s;ual &s;alam, but would not &s;it till I took a chair near him. Seeing &s;omebody, I forget who, look at a watch, he
<PB N="96" REF="98">
got up, and &s;aid he was ready, and imme|diately turning to three Bramins, who were to attend and take care of his body, he embraced them all clo&s;ely, but without the lea&s;t mark of melancholy or depre&s;&s;ion on his part, while they were in agonies of grief and de&s;pair. I then looked at my own watch, told him the hour I had mentioned was not arrived, that it wanted above a quarter of eight, but that I &s;hould wait his own time, and that I would not ri&s;e from my &s;eat without a motion from him. Upon its being recommended to him, that, at the place of execution, he would give &s;ome &s;ignal when he had done with this world, he &s;aid he would &s;peak. We &s;at about a quarter of an hour longer, during which he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf more than once to me; mentioned Rajah Gourda&s;s, the General, Colo|nel Mon&s;on, and Mr. Francis, but without any &s;eeming anxiety; the re&s;t of the time, I believe he pa&s;&s;ed in prayer; his lips and tongue moving, and his beads hanging upon his hand. He then looked to me and aro&s;e, &s;poke to &s;ome of the &s;ervants of the goal, telling them that any thing he might have omitted Rajah Gour|da&s;s would take care of, then walked chear|fully to the gate, and &s;eated him&s;elf in his

pallankeen, looking round him with perfect unconcern. As the Deputy Sheriff and I followed, we could make no ob&s;ervation upon his deportment till we all arrived at the place of execution. The croud there was very great, but not the lea&s;t appearance of a riot. The Rajah &s;at in his pallankeen upon the bearers' &s;houlders, and looked around at fir&s;t with &s;ome attention. I did not ob&s;erve the &s;malle&s;t di&s;compo&s;ure in his countenance or manner, at &s;ight of the gallows or any of the ceremonies pa&s;&s;ing about it. He a&s;ked for the Bramins, who were not come up, and &s;hewed &s;ome earne&s;tne&s;s, as if he apprehended the execution might take place before their arrival. I took that opportunity of a&s;&s;uring him, I would wait his own time, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it was early in the day, and there was no hurry."</Q> The Bra|mins &s;oon after appearing, I offered to remove the officers, thinking that he might have &s;omething to &s;ay in private, but he made a motion not to do it, and &s;aid he had only a few words to remind them, of what he had &s;aid concerning Rajah Gourda&s;s, and the care of his <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Zenana. Properly the apartments of the women; meaning here, in the &s;en&s;e of a Bramin who does not ad|mit of polygamy, his wife and children.</NOTE> Zenana. He &s;poke to me, and de|&s;ired
<PB N="98" REF="100">
that the men might be taken care of, as they were to take charge of his body, which he de&s;ired repeatedly might not be touched by any of the bye-&s;tanders; but he &s;eemed not the lea&s;t alarmed or di&s;compo&s;ed at the croud around him. There was &s;ome delay in the nece&s;&s;ary preparations, and from the awkward|ne&s;s of the people; but he was no way de&s;irous of protracting the bu&s;ine&s;s, but repeatedly told me he was ready. Upon my a&s;king him if he had any more friends he wi&s;hed to &s;ee, he an&s;wered he had many, but this was not a place, nor an occa&s;ion to look for them. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Did he apprehend there might be any pre|&s;ent, who could not get up for the crowd?"</Q> He mentioned one, who&s;e name was called; but he immediately &s;aid, it was of no con&s;e|quence, <Q REND="inline">"probably he had not come."</Q> He then de&s;ired me to remember him to General Clavering, Colonel Mon&s;on, and Mr. Francis, and looked with the greate&s;t compo&s;ure. When he was not engaged in conver&s;ation, he lay back in his pallankeen, moving his lips and tongue as before. I then cau&s;ed him to be a&s;ked about the &s;ignal he was to make, which could not be done by &s;peaking, on ac|count of the noi&s;e of the croud. He &s;aid he would make a motion with his hand; and,
<PB N="99" REF="101">
when it was repre&s;ented to him that it would be nece&s;&s;ary for his hands to be tied, in order to prevent any involuntary motion, and I re|commended his making a motion with his feet, he &s;aid he would. Nothing now re|mained, except the la&s;t painful ceremony. I ordered his pallankeen to be brought clo&s;e under the gallows, but he cho&s;e to walk, which he did more erect than I have generally &s;een him. At the foot of the &s;teps, which lead to the &s;tage, he put his hands behind him to be tied with a handkerchief; looking round at the &s;ame time, with the utmo&s;t unconcern. Some difficulties ari&s;ing about the cloth, which &s;hould be tied over his face, he told the people that it mu&s;t not be done by one of us. I pre|&s;ented to him a &s;ubaltern &s;eapoy officer, who is a Bramin, and came forward with his hand|kerchief in his hand, but the Rajah pointed to a &s;ervant of his own, who was laying pro&s;trate at his feet, and beckoned him to do it. He had &s;ome weakne&s;s in his feet, which, added to the confinement of his hands, made him mount the &s;teps with difficulty, but he &s;hewed not the lea&s;t reluctance, &s;crambling rather for|ward to get up. He then &s;tood erect on the &s;tage, whil&s;t I examined his countenance as
<PB N="100" REF="102">
&s;tedfa&s;tly as I could, till the cloth covered it, to &s;ee if I could ob&s;erve the &s;malle&s;t &s;ymp|tom of fear or alarm, but there was not a trace of it. My own &s;pirits &s;unk, and I &s;tepped into my pallankeen; but before I was well &s;eated, he had given the &s;ignal, and the &s;tage was removed. I could ob&s;erve, when I was a little recovered, that his arms lay back in the &s;ame po&s;ition in which I &s;aw them fir&s;t tied, nor could I perceive any contortion on that &s;ide of his mouth and face which were vi&s;ible. In a word, his &s;teadine&s;s, compo|&s;ure, and re&s;olution throughout the whole of this melancholy tran&s;action, were equal to any examples of fortitude I have ever read or heard of. The body was taken down, after hanging the u&s;ual time, and delivered to the Bramins for burning.</P>
