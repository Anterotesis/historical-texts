<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following work is &s;ubmitted to the pe|ru&s;al of the public, with infinite timidity, and apprehen&s;ion, as it is a &s;pecies of writing, which I had never attempted before, from a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my dificiency, in the principal ar|ticle of &s;uch compo&s;itions, namely invention.</P>
<P>THE generality of NOVEL-READERS may, therefore, probably, be di&s;appointed in not meet|ing with any extraordinary adventure, or uncom|mon &s;ituation, in the following pages; while per&s;ons of a more natural ta&s;te, will, I flatter my&s;elf, be rather plea&s;ed at finding the &s;tories and incidents, here ralated, &s;uch as might, for I affirm they did, and mo&s;t of them to my own knowledge, certainly happen, in the various contingencies of real life.</P>
<P>BUT though I have not attempted to feign any fable, I acknowledge that I have endeavoured to conceal &s;ome truth, by changing &s;cenes, and altering circum&s;tances, in order to avoid too marked an application, of the &s;everal &s;tories and characters, to the real per&s;ons, from whom I have taken my drama. We have no right over other per&s;ons &s;ecrets, come they to our know|ledge through what&s;oever medium of intelligence, they may.&mdash;Accident confers none, and confi|dence forbids it.</P>
<P>AS there is no fictitious memoir here ralated, neither is there any factitious moral di&s;played, to the incredulous reader, among&s;t all the vari|ous &s;entiments of this recital. I write not of puppets, but of men. I have endeavoured to de&s;cribe the feelings, nay the foibles, of the human heart, &s;uch as we are naturally con&s;cious of, in our&s;elves; but meddle not with <HI>the wires</HI>
<PB N="vi" REF="6">
<HI>of the floicks,</HI> which only render us <HI>machines,</HI> by helping us to <HI>perform a part,</HI> of which we have <HI>no &s;en&s;ation.</HI></P>
<P>I KNOW not whether novel, like the <HI>epopee,</HI> has any rules peculiar to it&s;elf&mdash;If it has I may have innocently erred again&s;t them all, and drawn upon my&s;elf the envenomed rage of that tremen|dous body, the <HI>minor critics.</HI>&mdash;But if I have &s;pread a table for them, they &s;hall be welcome to the treat, and let them feed upon it, heartily.&mdash;Sen&s;ibility is, in my mind, as nece&s;&s;ary, as ta&s;te, to intitle us to judge of a work, like this; and a cold critici&s;m, formed upon <HI>rules for wait|ing,</HI> can, therefore, be of no manner of u&s;e but to enable the &s;tupid to &s;peak, with a &s;eeming intelligence, of what they neither feel nor under&s;tand.</P>
<P>L'ABBE Troublet, in his e&s;&s;ays, on literature and morals, &s;ays,

<P>TELL me, my dear philo&s;ophie, wi&s;e &s;i&s;ter, why tho&s;e gloomy mortals, &s;tiled mora|li&s;ts, take &s;o much pains to put us out of hu|mour with our pre&s;ent &s;tate of exi&s;tence, by de|claring that happine&s;s is not the lot of man, &amp;c. &amp;c. Do they think the&s;e dogmas enhance the value of felicity, as unexpected ble&s;&s;ings are mo&s;tly prized? or is it that them&s;elves, &s;oured by mortifications and di&s;appointments, which their vanity or caprice have occa&s;ioned, they are unwilling to acknowledge that degree of per|fection, in any &s;tate of being, which they do not them&s;elves enjoy? but why do I argue, where I can at once confute? by declaring your Emily ble&s;&s;ed to the utmo&s;t extent of her mo&s;t ro|mantic wi&s;hes; and feeling, if po&s;&s;ible, an ad|dition to her felicity, by knowing that you &s;hare it.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="8">OUR journey was delightful; even the &s;un, which had not appeared for &s;ome days, &s;hone forth on us, in its full lu&s;tre: creation &s;miled; the gladne&s;s of my heart gilded every object; I thought the birds &s;ung hymeneals, and I was &s;orry when even Mi&s;s We&s;ton's fine voice inter|rupted their &s;till &s;weeter notes. My lord was&mdash;him&s;elf. I cannot &s;ay more, to expre&s;s all that is tender, elegant, and polite.</P>
<P>LADY Harriet, who you know, is of the gen|tle kind, looked a&s;&s;ent to our happine&s;s; yet fre|quent &s;ighs e&s;caped her. Why &s;hould &s;he &s;igh? I have heard people &s;ay they do &s;o from habit, without &s;en&s;ibility, or &s;en&s;ation. Time and u&s;e may po&s;&s;ibly work &s;uch an effect, but this habit mu&s;t certainly have its ri&s;e, either from &s;ickne&s;s, or &s;orrow. Perhaps lady Harriet may be in love If unhappily &s;o, how truly to be pitied;</P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould yet be able to give you any idea of this fine old &s;eat, nor do I think I &s;hall ever attempt it. I had much rather you &s;hould &s;ee than read its beauties. I hate flou|ri&s;hing de&s;criptions. Modern writers over-dre&s;s nature, as ill judging women do them&s;elves. They give her parterres for patches, hanging woods for lappets, and embroider her beautiful green gown, with all the colours of the rainbow. I flatter my&s;elf that your ta&s;te (for it is elegant) will ap|prove whatever my lord has planned; and I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t much on your admiring the works of his ance&s;tors. The clo&s;et in which I am now writing is charmingly &s;ituated. It commands&mdash;but after what I have ju&s;t &s;aid, let me command my pen.</P>
<P>MY lord, ever kind and attentive to me, wrote to his &s;i&s;ter, Lady Law&s;on, who lives eight miles off, to defer her vi&s;it, till this day, as it was probable I might have been fatigued with my
<PB N="9" REF="9">
journey. He &s;peaks with &s;uch extreme tender|ne&s;s of this lady, that I begin to love her, alrea|dy, by anticipation.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>Lady</HI> STRAFFON <HI>to Lady</HI> WOODVILLE.</HEAD>
<P>MAY my deare&s;t Emily ever continue an exception to tho&s;e opinions, which notwith|&s;tanding her pre&s;ent felicity, have too &s;urely their foundation in this world's experience. The bit|ter ingredients of life, are, however, more &s;pa|ringly &s;cattered in the potions of &s;ome, than others; and I believe there may be many who have pa&s;&s;ed through life, without feeling one na|tural misfortune.&mdash;But then, the&s;e favourites of heaven, unworthy of its bounty, are apt to cre|ate afflictions for them&s;elves, and mourn over ideal for want of real di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>THIS is a failing I am not at all apprehen&s;ive of your falling into, at lea&s;t for &s;ome years to come; but as I have ever acted as a mother to my deare&s;t Emily, or at lea&s;t, endeavoured, as far as it was po&s;&s;ible for me, to &s;upply that lo&s;s to her infant years, let me now, with the &s;ame maternal tenderne&s;s, warn her again&s;t the con|trary extreme, that of being too much elated with her pre&s;ent joys, <Q REND="inline">"le&s;t whil&s;t &s;he cla&s;ps &s;he kills them."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="10">AND now, my Emily, a truce with moraliz|ing, which I confe&s;s, would have been improper at this aera, but that you brought it on your&s;elf; and I only appear in the character of the &s;lave, who attended the triumphs of the Roman con|querors, merely to inform them they were mor|tal. Gracious heaven! that &s;uch an information &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary, to any of thy frail creatures! But I find my&s;elf relap&s;ing, and will learn from you to command my pen.</P>
<P>POOR lady Harriet! I am &s;orry &s;he &s;hould have cau&s;e to &s;igh; for I agree with you, that &s;ighing may be <HI>incidental,</HI> but not <HI>accidental.</HI> I hope the gay &s;cene of receiving and returning vi&s;its, &amp;c. in which &s;he will be engaged with you, may help to di&s;&s;ipate the cloud of her cha|grin. I rejoice in the acqui&s;ition of your new &s;i&s;ter; &s;he mu&s;t be amiable if lord Woodville loves her. What a compliment to my Emily! but let it rather make her grateful than vain.</P>
<P>I FEAR I &s;hall not have an opportunity of approving my ta&s;te, by admiring lord Woodville's improvements, for &s;ome time. Sir John, who is not a little jealous of your not having menti|oned him, purpo&s;es going, for a couple of months to Paries. Do not grow jealous, in your turn. I do not intend to accompany him, to that gay &s;cene, which would have fewer charms for me, than the rational and rural plea&s;ures of Woodfort. But I de&s;ign to inoculate my little Edward and Emily, during his ab&s;ence. I &s;hall not acquaint him with my intention, till it is over. I know he wi&s;hes it done; and I would &s;pare him the anxiety of a fond father, upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion. I know too he will be va&s;tly obliged to me, for laying hold of this opportunity; for it is an invariable maxim, that all men hate trou|ble of every kind, and choo&s;e to be out of the
<PB N="11" REF="11">
way, when there is any di&s;agreeable operation to be performed</P>
<P>MY &s;i&s;ter Straffon, who you know is to be married to Sir James Miller, has determined to take her chance with my children. She &s;ays &s;he could not an&s;wer it to her con&s;cience, to marry Sir James, who &s;eems to be enamoured of her face, till &s;he has put her features beyond the common danger of an alteration. I went with her la&s;t night, to Ranelagh&mdash;as &s;he &s;aid, to take leave of it: I hope but for a &s;hort time.</P>
<P>THE attention of the whole a&s;&s;emby, was taken up with a beautiful foreigner, the marchi|one&s;s de St. Aumont. I think I never beheld &s;o much vivacity and &s;weetne&s;s joined, before, in the &s;ame countenance. I have ju&s;t looked up at your picture, and thought it tacitly reproached me, for having &s;o &s;oon forgot my Emily's face. I'll look again. Her eyes have more vivacity, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, but yours a greater &s;weetne&s;s. Hers are black, yours are blue. The advantage which each of you have, over the other, in this parti|cular, may be more owing to colour, than ex|pre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE marchione&s;s has been a widow, about a year, and does not appear to be above twenty. I am certain that if I were a man, I &s;hould be in love with her. I am glad &s;he has left Paris, before my <HI>Straffon</HI> goes thither&mdash;you may read <HI>Strephon</HI> if you plea&s;e. I &s;hall take care to keep him out of danger, while he &s;tays in London; or perhaps, &s;he might keep him &s;ighing at home, and &s;o mar both his &s;cheme and mine. The very be&s;t of the&s;e men, my dear Emily, have hearts nearly re&s;embling tinder, though they would have us think they are made of a &s;terner &s;tuff&mdash;a &s;parkling eye &s;ets them all in a blaze.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="12">LADY Sandford, who doats upon foreigners, has already engro&s;&s;ed her; perhaps &s;he may en|gage her to go with her into the country. If &s;o, you will, probably meet her, at York races; and if that &s;hould happen, it will be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for lord Woodville to arm him&s;elf, cap-&agrave; pie, with con&s;tancy, and for you al&s;o, to rivet the joints of that armour, with unaffected complacency, chearfulne&s;s and love.</P>
<P>LUCY and Sir James Miller are in the draw|ing-room. I fancy &s;he is tired of a t&ecirc;te-a-t&ecirc;te, as the fonde&s;t lovers &s;ometimes are; for &s;he has ju&s;t &s;ent your little name-&s;ake, to reque&s;t my company. I mu&s;t, therefore, quit you, to at|tend her &s;ummons. I &s;hall expect a particular account of all occurrences, at Woodfort as the mo&s;t minute matter, that relates to you, mu&s;t ever be of con&s;equence to your affectionate.</P>

<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>P.S. As I have yet time enough to &s;end my letter, I &s;hall acquaint you with the occa&s;ion of my being called from it. Lucy had ju&s;t in|formed Sir James that &s;he intended to be inocu|lated. He oppo&s;ed it, with the utmo&s;t vehe|mence, and told many &s;tories, upon that &s;ubject, to intimidate her. In vain; &s;he continued firm to her purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>HE then entreated that they might be married before the operation, and he would give his con|&s;ent to her undergoing it, in ten days after. This &s;he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed; and, I think, with good rea&s;on. The altercation grew warm, on both &s;ides; I was cho&s;en umpire; and gave my opinion, in favour of Lucy's arguments. Sir James &s;aid I was a partial judge, and quitted us, &s;oon after, with &s;ome little warmth.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="13">I WAS &s;orry to perceive a &s;tarting tear in Lu|cy's lovely eye, and rallied her, on being low|&s;pirited. She confe&s;&s;ed &s;he felt a kind of forebo|ding, that the union between Sir James and her, would never be accompli&s;hed; and yet &s;aid, &s;he had not the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ion that her death would prevent it. I told her that I fore&s;aw no|thing el&s;e that could, as her beauty was even le&s;s in danger from this experiment than her life.</P>
<P>SHE replied, that they were both of them but tran&s;ient ble&s;&s;ings, and &s;he had, happily, brought her mind to &s;uch a &s;tate of re&s;ignation, as to be fully prepared for the lo&s;s of either. But &s;he owned that &s;he had not yet accu&s;tomed her&s;elf to the thought of re&s;igning Sir James: however, if &s;he was to lo&s;e his affection, &s;he could better &s;u&s;tain that affliction, bofore marri|age, than after.</P>
<P>HERE her eyes &s;treamed again, and while I was endeavouring to di&s;&s;ipate the&s;e gloomy va|pours, Sir John luckily came in, to the relief of us both, as it put an end to the &s;ubject of inocu|lation, which I told you before, he is not to receive the lea&s;t hint about, for the pre&s;ent. But Lucy and he are affectionately yours, and rejoice with me in your happine&s;s.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DID not in&s;i&s;t upon the permanence of hu|man felicity. I &s;aid only, that there was &s;uch a thing as perfect happine&s;s, and, I hope, with a truly grateful heart, acknowledged my&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that rare trea&s;ure. However, your letter has given a little alloy to it, and ren|dered it le&s;s pure and unmixed.</P>
<P>I FEEL for you on your children's account, and for Lucy on her own. She has long deter|mined on inoculation: &s;he mentioned it to lady Harriet, before I was married, and made her will, the day after &s;he became of age. I admire her fortitude, but fear I &s;hould not be able to imitate it.</P>
<P>YOUR de&s;cription of the marchione&s;s, is really alarming, and has already made me jea|lous not of lord Woodville, but of lady Straffon. If you &s;hould ever become acquainted with her, &s;he will certainly rival every body, but Sir John, and the dear little ones. Perhaps Lucy's heroi&s;m may &s;till pre&s;erve her &s;ome place in your heart, but the poor ab&s;ent Emily will be totally forgot|ten, when you already begin to &s;tand in need of her picture to remind you of her.</P>
<P>MY lord, and lady Harriet, both knew her in Paris and both agree that the charms of her per|&s;on are inferior to tho&s;e of her mind; and that &s;he was &s;till more admired, as un bel e&s;prit, than as une belle dame. Won't you give me credit for the utmo&s;t genero&s;ity, in furni&s;hing you with this account of my rival that is to be?</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="15">I HOPE &s;he may come to York races, that I may have an opportunity of examining this phoenix, with a critic's eye; but it &s;hall not be like the modern ones, who are, generally, &s;o intent on &s;pying defects, that they are apt to overlook the mo&s;t &s;triking beauties. This, how|ever, may &s;ometimes proceed rather from a want of ta&s;te, than a &s;pirit of malevolence, and I am always inclined to pity tho&s;e unhappy peo|ple, who never &s;eem to be plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>CHARMING lady Law&s;on! What an engag|ing countenance, what a quick &s;en&s;ibility in her looks, what an irre&s;&s;i&s;tible &s;mile! I am not under a nece&s;&s;ity of looking at my bracelet, to remind me that this portrait re&s;embles lady Straffon: but lady Law&s;on is taller, thinner, and more of the brunette. She is two years younger than my lord, and has been married &s;ix years, to Sir Wil|liam Law&s;on, who &s;eems to be what they call a jolly good-humoured man. He hates Lon|don, loves fox hunting, and has, they &s;ay, no exception to a chearful gla&s;s, or a pretty la&s;s. I fear poor lady Law&s;on was thrown away; though Sir William is generally e&s;teemed what they call a good hu&s;band. He behaves outwardly well to his wife, merely becau&s;e &s;he is &s;o, and would have treated her chambermaid, in the &s;ame man|ner, if he had happened to marry her. What a mortifying &s;ituation, to a woman of delicacy!</P>
<P>THE meeting between her and my lord, was truly affectionate, and tender. She had not &s;een him &s;ince his return from making the grand tour. She thanked him, in the mo&s;t graceful manner, for increa&s;ing her happine&s;s, by en&s;uring his own, and &s;he al&s;o hoped, that of &s;o amiable a per&s;on, &s;he was plea&s;ed to add, as lady Woodville. My lord replied, that if any thing could add to his felicity, it mu&s;t be her approbation of his choice,
<PB N="16" REF="16">
which he was certain would encrea&s;e with her knowledge of his dear Emily. He then joined our hands, bowed, and withdrew. How kind in him to be &s;peak her favour for me! But I &s;hall endeavour to de&s;erve, what &s;he &s;eems &s;o ready to be&s;tow.</P>
<P>LADY Harriet's dove-like eyes gli&s;tened with plea&s;ure at her cou&s;in's politene&s;s. She &s;aid there was a nearer relation between lady Law&s;on and me, than what my lord had given us, for we had kindred &s;ouls.</P>
<P>HERE the arrival of a great deal of company, put an end to all conver&s;ation. Is it not &s;urpriz|ing, &s;i&s;ter, that where there are mo&s;t words, there is generally the lea&s;t &s;en&s;e? And yet, it is always the ca&s;e; for I never remember to have met with any thing like rational di&s;cour&s;e, in a company that exceeded five or &s;ix.</P>
<P>LORD and Lady Withers, their two daugh|ters, the elde&s;t a fine woman, and once intended as a wife for lord Woodville. The point had been &s;ettled between their fathers, but the death of old lord Woodville, happily for me, left the &s;on at liberty to chu&s;e for him&s;elf. She appeared to be in &s;ome confu&s;ion, when he &s;aluted her, and I felt my&s;elf a good deal di&s;tre&s;&s;ed on her account.</P>
<P>WOMEN are not &s;uch wretches, as men mi&s;|repre&s;ent them. Conque&s;t, I own, is plea&s;ant, but I dete&s;t a triumph. It &s;inks one, methinks, below the vanqui&s;hed. Her &s;i&s;ter is pretty, young, and mode&s;t. I think the whole family amiable, and agreeable.</P>
<P>SIR Harry Ransford, and his lady.&mdash;What a pair! He old, gouty, and peevi&s;h&mdash;&s;he young, hand&s;ome and vulgar. His &s;on, by a former wife, polite, and &s;en&s;ible, with a well-made, genteel per&s;on. My lord and he were intimate
<PB N="17" REF="17" MS="y">
abroad. I wi&s;h he would fall in love with our dear lady Harriet. Nay, he certainly will do &s;o. I can't po&s;&s;ibly &s;ee how he can well avoid it.</P>
<P>MR. Wat&s;on, Mr. Young, Mr. Haywood, &amp;c. What a croud! You would have pitied me, Fanny. Though I have been four months married, I was &s;o be-brided, and wi&s;hed joy, that it made me downright &s;ad. Lady Law&s;on was very u&s;eful to me, in a&s;&s;i&s;ting to entertain the company. She has, in her manners and ad|dre&s;s, a great deal of that graceful, and courtly ea&s;e, which I always admire in others, without having ever been able to obtain, in my&s;elf. But all farther endeavours after this perfection, are, henceforward, at an end with me, and I hope now to be able to pre&s;erve my <HI>mauvai&s;e bonte,</HI> during life; for after twenty, it is rarely to be overcome, without <HI>paying too dear,</HI> for the con|que&s;t.</P>
<P>IN the afternoon, the younger part of my lord's tenants appeared in the avenue, neatly dre&s;&s;ed, and adorned with all the honours of the &s;pring, and forming a long dance together. My lord propo&s;ed our going out to &s;ee them; I found this had been de&s;igned, as there was a large car|pet &s;pread on the lawn, and &s;eats already pre|pared for us.</P>
<P>WHEN we were &s;eated, they pa&s;&s;ed by, in couples, chanting a ru&s;tic hymn, in prai&s;e of Hymen, and &s;trewing flowers before me. At length, they pre&s;ented me with a beautiful, and fragrant wreath, which I immediately placed on lord Woodville's brow, while the villagers re|treated &s;inging, and forming them&s;elves into a rural dance, infinitely more agreeable to me, than any of the grands balets, at the oppera, or
<PB N="18" REF="18">
theatres. We left them at their &s;port, and re|turned into the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>AFTER tea, my lord propo&s;ed our following the example of his merry pea&s;ants. This was readily a&s;&s;ented to, by every one, but Sir Harry Ransford, who told us he never lay within ten miles of his own hou&s;e, after the twenty fifth of March; and in&s;i&s;ted upon lady Ransford's going away with him, that in&s;tant, as he &s;aid they &s;hould hardly be able to reach home, by his u&s;ual time of going to bed, at nine o'clock, &s;ummer and winter.</P>
<P>WE all intreated that he would permit lady Ransford to &s;tay, which he peremptorily refu&s;ed, &s;aying, it would be &s;etting an ill example to the bridegroom, to let women have their way. She &s;aid every thing in her power to prevail, but when &s;he found it in vain, and that he would force her away, &s;he was provoked, at la&s;t to call him methodical <HI>mon&s;ter.</HI> He replied, that it was better to be <HI>one,</HI> by his own <HI>method,</HI> than hers, and hobbled into his coach. She followed, with the face of a fury. What a delightful t&ecirc;te-&aacute;-t&ecirc;te mu&s;t theirs be!</P>
<P>MR. Ransford &s;taid, and danced with me. I think him the be&s;t dancer I ever &s;aw. Our little ball got the better of all di&s;agreeable re&s;erve; and, at &s;upper, we appeared like old acquain|tance, perfectly at ea&s;e, and quite chearful. My lord was in remarkable good &s;pirits, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d even lady Harriet &s;eemed gay. The Wither's are a char|ming family; both the young ladies play on the harp&s;ichord, and &s;ing finely.</P>
<P>WE had an agreeable concert the next day; they &s;taid till late in the evening. Sir William and lady Law&s;on went home this morning We are to return their vi&s;it to-morrow. Mr. Rans|ford is &s;till with us. He is a great lover of mu|&s;ic;

<P>I AM much obliged to my dear Emily, for the entertaining detail of her amu&s;ements in the country. I am charmed with your account of la|dy Law&s;on, and am not, like my dear &s;poiled child, the lea&s;t inclined to be jealous. I thank you for the flattering likene&s;s you have drawn of

me; may there be a &s;till &s;tronger re&s;emblance between us, in our love and e&s;teem for lady Woodville!</P>
<P>I THINK you extremely happy in meeting with &s;uch an amiable friend, in &s;o agreeable a neighbour. She will, I doubt not, be kind enough to inform you of the <HI>Carte du pais,</HI> where you are &s;ituated: and what is of infinite|ly more con&s;equence to your happine&s;s, &s;he may acquaint you with the particulars of her bro|ther's temper; for be a&s;&s;ured, all charming as he is, that he has &s;ome, the knowing and treating of which properly, may be the &s;ure&s;t ba&s;is of your future felicity.</P>
<P>SIR John &s;et out for Paris, la&s;t Monday, and, in an hour after, Mr. Ranby inoculated Lucy and my dear children. Though I have the firm|e&s;t reliance on the goodne&s;s of Providence, and the fulle&s;t conviction of the general &s;ucce&s;s of this opperation, the mother could not &s;tand it. I was forced to retire to my clo&s;et. I repented my not having acquainted Sir John, with my de&s;ign, and thought, that if any mifortune &s;hould hap|pen to either of the children, even his grief would &s;eem a con&s;tant reproach to me.</P>
<P>IN this &s;ituation of mind, I poured forth my &s;oul in fervent prayer, before the throne of mer|cy. My apprehen&s;ions vani&s;hed, the rectitude of my intentions confirmed my re&s;olutions, and I felt my&s;elf perfectly calm, and re&s;igned. Amaz|ing efficacy of true devotion! But indeed, my dear Emily, there is no other re&s;ource for the afflicted. No other balm to heal the wounded &s;oul. By this, and this alone, we are enabled to triumph over pain, &s;ickne&s;s, di&s;tre&s;s, &s;orrow, even death it&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE children are in a fine way, and have re|ceived the infection. Lucy, it is thought, has
<PB N="21" REF="21">
not. She in&s;i&s;ts upon being inoculated again, to|morrow. Sir James &s;upped with us, on Sunday night; and told us with a grave face, that he &s;hould not &s;ee us again, till his affair was quite over; for if he vi&s;ited here, he could go no where el&s;e. I laughed and bid him &s;tay away, if he could.</P>
<P>THOUGH I did not think him &s;erious, he has hitherto kept his word, but &s;ends a formal card, every day, to enquire of our healths. I &s;ee that his behaviour hurts Lucy, though &s;he affects not to take notice of it. I hear he &s;pends all his time with Mi&s;s Nel&s;on. She is artful and agreeable. I begin to fear poor Lucy's pre&s;age may be veri|fied.</P>

<P>THE devil's in it, if the honey moon is not over yet, and you near half a year married. This is carrying on the farce too far, and looks as if you wanted to make us infidels believe, that plea&s;ure was to be found in the &s;ober and virtu|ous &s;cheme of matrimony.</P>
<P>I ALLOW your wife to be hand&s;ome. I will &s;uppo&s;e her lively, and agreeable too; but then, have you not had time enough to be tired of all the&s;e perfections? and whenever that happened,

<P>I SHOULD never forgive a wife that did not &s;upply me with a rea&s;on for hating, when I grew weary of her.

<P>YOU will, perhaps, tell me, that lady Wood|ville is a very different kind of woman, from tho&s;e I hint at. It may be &s;o; and I will admit it. But prithee, Harry, is &s;he not your wife? And in that comprehen&s;ive term, are not re&s;traint, care, limitation of plea&s;ures, and &s;qualling brats, included? But love her, if you will, and as long as you can: but, believe me, the only way to keep &s;uch a &s;ickly flame alive, is by the fuel of ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, order your hor&s;es directly, and leave her, where &s;he &s;hould ever remain, &s;ixed to the freehold; while you &s;hine forth, once more, among your old friends, at the Shake&s;pear.

<P>I RECEIVED your lively letter; but wi&s;h you had cho&s;en a fitter &s;ubject to di&s;play your wit upon, than the old common-place topic of matri|mony. Were I not perfectly acquainted with your writing, as well as your humour, I &s;hould have thought your letter a counterfeit. You are no libertine, Thornton, and yet &s;eem to take plea&s;ure in adopting their gro&s;s, and contemptible &s;entiments.</P>
<P>THEIR general abu&s;e of women is truly ridi|diculous: they pretend to know them, without having ever conver&s;ed with any, but that unhap|py &s;pecies of them, who&s;e minds and manners are a di&s;grace not only to their &s;ex, but to human nature it&s;elf. Profligates fir&s;t betray to infamy all the women they can deceive; and then, by a double inju&s;tice, judge of the &s;ex, from the ex|amples they have made.</P>
<P>BUT come, my young friend, and convince your&s;elf that happine&s;s is to be found in a vir|tuous connection with an amiable and agreeable woman. Order your hor&s;es, directly, I &s;ay; and leave your gro&s;s errors where they &s;hould ever remain, in Covent Garden.</P>
<P>I NEVER was a member of any &s;ociety at the Shake&s;pear, though I have &s;pent &s;ome evenings there, both plea&s;antly and innocently. I love chearfulne&s;s, wit, and humour, wherever to be met with; and when Sir James Thornton &s;hall be added to our &s;ociety at Woodfort, I &s;hall not have occa&s;ion to go in pur&s;uit of any of them,

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Dear Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I ARRIVED in London, the day after you left it: how unfortunate to have mi&s;&s;ed the friend of my heart! to whom I have a thou&s;and things to communicate, that will not bear the cold, &s;low forms of narrative letter writing.</P>
<P>BUT one &s;ad truth I mu&s;t pour into your bo|&s;om, from mine, that almo&s;t bur&s;ts while I repeat it. The lovely, the angelic Charlotte Beaumont, has fled from the&s;e fond arms, and taken refuge in a convent! I beheld her renounce the pomps, and vanities, of that world, which &s;he was born to adorn. None but her kindred angels ever ap|peared &s;o beautiful as &s;he, when led like a bloom|ing &s;acrifice to the altar.</P>
<P>AS &s;he advanced up the i&s;le, &s;he caught <HI>my eyes</HI>; &s;he &s;topt, and &s;igh'd; but quickly recollecting her&s;elf, turned <HI>her's</HI> to heaven&mdash;then with a ray of that ineffable tenderne&s;s, with which we may &s;uppo&s;e angelic beings look on mortal woes, &s;he turned them full on m &mdash; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">t ah! too &s;oon re|called them, and pa&s;&s;ed along, with all the digni|ty of con&s;cious virtue!</P>
<P>How I got out of the convent, I know not: my &s;en&s;es vani&s;hed with her&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> was fifteen days delirious; and but for the officious kindne&s;s of Wil&s;on, &s;hould not now feel tho&s;e poignant ago|nies,

that rend my heart. O Woodville, to lo&s;e &s;uch a woman, by my own folly! that fatal duel, in what mi&s;ery has it involved me! When I am calm enough, if that &s;hould ever be, I will copy her <HI>la&s;t letter,</HI> and &s;end it to you: I would not part with the original for worlds, though it has de&s;troyed my peace in this.</P>
<P>WILL you forgive your wretched friend for breaking in one moment on your pre&s;ent felicity? I hear you are completely ble&s;&s;ed.&mdash;This is the only ray of joy, that ever can, or &s;hall pervade the gloom, in which my fate is involved. Hap|py Woodville! to triumph over an unhappy pa&s;|&s;ion, and now to feel the tran&s;ports of &s;ucce&s;sful love!</P>
<P>BUT let me intreat you, as you value your fu|ture peace not to &s;ee the marchione&s;s. Your wounds are not long healed, and may all bleed again.

<P>THIS &s;ingle con&s;ideration will, I am certain, be a more powerful pre&s;ervative to your generous heart, than all the philo&s;ophic rea&s;onings in the world; which too well I know, were never yet proof again&s;t &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear, unhappy Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM truly &s;orry that I had left London be|fore your arrival.&mdash;Had you given me the lea&s;t hint of your intentions to return, I &s;hould certainly have &s;taid to meet you: and I would, at this moment, fly to pour the balm of friend&s;hip into your wounded bo&s;om, but that Sir James Thornton, whom I have invited to &s;pend &s;ome time with me at Woodfort, and go with me to York races, came here la&s;t night.</P>
<P>HE is quite a &s;tranger to lady Woodville, and all this family, and would certainly con&s;ider it as the highe&s;t breach of ho&s;pitality, if I were to leave him in the hands of a parcel of <HI>virtuous</HI> wo|men, which are a race of beings, that he is totally unacquainted with. He is young, has a very large fortune, and many amiable qualities; but his education has been &s;o &s;hamefully neglected, that he is in imminent danger of becoming a prey to &s;harpers and pro&s;titutes.</P>
<P>EVEN you mu&s;t have &s;miled, to have &s;een this young man, who is made up of frolic, and viva|city, look as frighted and aba&s;hed, before lady Woodville, who&s;e gentlene&s;s it&s;elf as a young country lady, who has never been out of the fa|mily man&s;ion, when fir&s;t pre&s;ented at St. James's. But I hope this timid aukwardne&s;s will wear off in a few days: and as I know nothing that can refine the &s;entiments, or poli&s;h the manners &s;o much, as the cover&s;ation of elegant women, I wi&s;h to keep Sir James, for &s;ome time, among&s;t us.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="27">MY cou&s;in, lady Hariet Hanbury, is here; and a very lively girl, Mi&s;s We&s;ton, a near rela|tion of my Emily! Your old friend Ransford, &s;pends much of his time with us al&s;o. What would I not give to tempt you hither! You &s;hall retire when you plea&s;e; read, walk, and mu&s;e alone: and when you are di&s;po&s;ed, my Emily &s;hall play to you, &s;ome of the &s;weete&s;t, &s;ofte&s;t airs, the very food of love, accompanied with the &s;weete&s;t, &s;ofte&s;t voice, you ever heard. Harriet, who is of the melancholy ca&s;t, and, I fear, unhappily in love, &s;hall &s;igh, in concert with you; and Thornton, and Mi&s;s We&s;ton, &s;hall &s;ometimes make you &s;mile.</P>
<P>I CONFESS to you, my dear Seymour, that I was both &s;hocked and &s;orry, when I heard that the marchione&s;s was in England. Lady Wood|ville was the fir&s;t per&s;on who informed me of it: but, utterly ignorant of there having ever been any connection between us, &s;he did not perceive my emotion at her name.</P>
<P>CRUEL woman! does &s;he wi&s;h again to di&s;turb the peace of a heart, which &s;he had well nigh broken! but I defy her power.&mdash;In lady Wood|ville I have found all that is amiable in the mo&s;t lovely &s;ex; &s;en&s;ible, beautiful, gentle, kind, and unaffectedly good.</P>
<P>TRUE, &s;he is not mi&s;tre&s;s of tho&s;e lively &s;al|lies of wit, that dazzle the under&s;tanding, and captivate the heart. Her form, though lovely, has not the &s;triking elegance, the namele&s;s, num|berle&s;s graces, that wait on every motion of the marchione&s;s!</P>
<P>BUT why do I &s;uffer my&s;elf to dwell upon her charms? or make a compari&s;on injurious to the amiable woman, who de&s;erves my love? why can I not &s;ay, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it! Ah, Sey|mour! it is impo&s;&s;ible to regulate the motions of
<PB N="28" REF="28">
the human heart, by the cold rules of rea&s;on. Not all the charms of the whole &s;ex combined can ever render mine &s;u&s;ceptible of tho&s;e ago|nizing tran&s;ports it has already known. Yet let me boa&s;t, that it is as impo&s;&s;ible for her, who fir&s;t occa&s;ioned, to revive, as for any other woman, to in&s;pire them.</P>
<P>IF this was not the ca&s;e, I &s;hould have made a worthle&s;s pre&s;ent to my Emily, when I gave her both my hand and heart: and though I allow the latter not to be an adequate return for hers, &s;he &s;hall never be able to di&s;cover its deficiency, by any word, or action of my life. This I can &s;afely promi&s;e.</P>
<P>I HAVE purpo&s;ely avoided mentioning your lo&s;t, your lovely Charlotte! When you are more at ea&s;e, I know you will acquaint me with the particulars of your di&s;tre&s;s.

<P>YOUR letter has added to the affliction I am already involved in. I think I am fated never to po&s;&s;e&s;s any of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, without which life is a burthen. The object of my fond|e&s;t, tendere&s;t wi&s;hes, already torn from my bleed|ing heart; there remained yet one con&s;olation; a generous, and affectionate friend; and he, in human &s;uicide, is going to rob me of him&s;elf! what an hard lot is mine! all that I ever loved, devote them&s;elves; and by their mi&s;ery, I am twice undone!</P>
<P>BUT &s;top, my friend; and let my warning voice prevent your ru&s;hing down the precipice! you mu&s;t not, &s;hall nor, &s;ee the marchione&s;s.

<P>I WENT, la&s;t night, to pay a vi&s;it to my &s;i&s;ter, lady Sandford, and there I met your lovely ene|my. She a&s;ked many que&s;tions about you, but many more about lady Woodville, and wanted me to draw her picture. I told her that I had not &s;een her, for &s;ome years; that &s;he was then extremely young, but had, I thought, a very near re&s;emblence to her lady&s;hip, which was pro|nouncing her a perfect beauty.</P>
<P>I SAID this, to prevent her finding fault, which &s;he certainly would have done, had I attempted a particular de&s;cription. She &s;aw through my de&s;ign, but would not let me triumph in the &s;ucce&s;s of it, then &s;miling &s;aid,

And I really think that London is as much the &s;eat of gallantry, as Paris."&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>THE arrival of other company gave the con|ver&s;ation a general turn; but what I have repeat|ed, is, I think, &s;ufficient to make you fly from a woman, who audaciou&s;ly owns her de&s;igns again&s;t your peace.

<P>I CANNOT tell my deare&s;t Fanny how much her la&s;t letter affected me; nor can I &s;uffi|ciently expre&s;s my admiration of that happy turn of mind, that enables you to triumph over every difficulty and di&s;tre&s;s, and to ri&s;e &s;o far &s;uperior to what any one might rea&s;onably expect, from the gentlene&s;s of your nature, on every trial.</P>
<P>HOW happy is it for your poor weak Emely, that &s;he has had nothing to &s;truggle with! &s;he would have &s;unk beneath the &s;lighte&s;t weight, and give a loo&s;e to tears, and to complainings. But let the goodne&s;s of that all-wi&s;e Providence, who proportions our trials to our &s;trength, fill my heart with the warme&s;t gratitude, and let me <Q REND="inline">"ever ble&s;s, and prai&s;e his name."</Q></P>
<P>I HAVE no &s;ort of doubt but you are ea&s;ed of all a mother's fears, by this time, and that the dear little ones are prattling round you, with their u&s;ual chearfulne&s;s; while you feel, even an ad|ditional
<PB N="32" REF="32">
tenderne&s;s from recollection of the dan|ger they have pa&s;t.</P>
<P>I HAVE very unea&s;y apprehen&s;ions for poor Lucy: I almo&s;t wi&s;h &s;he may not receive the in|fection.&mdash;There have been numberle&s;s in&s;tances of per&s;ons who never had the &s;mall pox; and I think it is like forcing nature to make a &s;econd effort.</P>
<P>I DETEST Sir James Miller; and hope, with all my heart he may never be married to Lucy, as I am very &s;ure he never will de&s;erve her.</P>
<P>OUR family party has received &s;ome very agreeable additions &s;ince I wrote la&s;t. There is a mo&s;t delightful contra&s;t between our vi&s;itors. Sir James Thornton, lively, boyi&s;h, with a good natural under&s;tanding, totally unimproved, with|out the lea&s;t idea of good breeding;&mdash;and yet, that want is amply &s;upplied, by what I call na|tural politene&s;s. But if <Q REND="inline">"good breeding is the blo&s;&s;om of good &s;en&s;e,"</Q> we ought to find out &s;ome other term, for that &s;pecies of form, which is only to he acquired in courts. There was &s;uch an aukward re&s;erve about poor Thornton, for the fir&s;t three days he &s;pent at Woodfort, that I looked upon him as a Hottentot: but that rough ca&s;t is now worn off, and he is really agreeable, and entertaining.</P>
<P>LORD Seymour, our late&s;t gue&s;t, is, really, an accompli&s;hed gentleman; an elegant form, and affable countenance, be&s;peak your favour, at fir&s;t &s;ight, and his every word and action in&s;en&s;ibly engage your regard. Yet, lavi&s;h as nature has been to him, there &s;eems to be &s;omething want|ing to his happine&s;s. There is a tender air of melancholy diffu&s;ed over his whole form, with &s;uch a &s;oftne&s;s in his voice and manner, as is rarely natural to the gay &s;ons of pro&s;perity. His
<PB N="33" REF="33">
fortune is ample, and his birth high; it mu&s;t then be that &s;ource of the mo&s;t poignant &s;orrow, ill-fated love, that has di&s;turbed his peace. Yet, I think, he could not love in vain, unle&s;s there was a prior prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. I long to know his &s;tory: I feel my&s;elf intere&s;ted, as for a brother.</P>
<P>HE acquainted my lord with his intentions to vi&s;it us, the night before he came. We were all engaged to dine at Sir Harry Ransford's, the next day; and her lady&s;hip had got the old knight to con&s;ent to her having a ball. My lord remained at Woodfort to receive his gue&s;t. I accompanied the young folks to Sir Harry's.&mdash;After tea, I intreated lady, Ransford to excu&s;e my leaving her, without taking any notice of it to the company. She was &s;o obliging as to con|&s;ent, and I drove home directly.</P>
<P>MY lord &s;eemed &s;urprized, and plea&s;ed, at &s;eeing me; and, as he handed me from the coach, &s;aid, with an air of the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s, I am much obliged to you for your attention to my friend; and can with truth a&s;&s;ure you, that your company is the only agreeable addition that could be made to our pre&s;ent &s;ociety. My little heart exulted at the kindne&s;s of this compliment; as to plea&s;e, or oblige him, is, and ever will be, its highe&s;t ambition. Notwith&s;tanding this, I thought my company was a re&s;traint on them, and therefore retired &s;oon after &s;upper.</P>
<P>IT was four o'clock, when my lord came up &s;tairs. I was mi&s;erably apprehen&s;ive he was ill, as he &s;ighed often, and was uncommonly re&s;t|le&s;s. But my fears are now fled, like a morn|ing dream.&mdash;He &s;eemed perfectly well at break|fa&s;t. Lord Seymour and he are gone into the gardens.</P>
<P>THE coach is ju&s;t returned with the boys and girls; and Thornton is, this moment, come
<PB N="34" REF="34">
into my dre&s;&s;ing-room, to tell me <HI>all about it,</HI> as he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf: but he is too civil to &s;peak, till I leave of writing. I mu&s;t, therefore, im|po&s;e &s;ilence on my&s;elf, to relieve him from it; and &s;o bid my dear &s;i&s;ter,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>Lady</HI> STRAFFON, <HI>to Lady</HI> WOODVILLE.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS va&s;tly plea&s;ed with my dear Emily's letter.&mdash;There is infinitely more merit in looking up to the Almighty, in our pro&s;perity, than adver&s;ity. Prai&s;e is &s;urely the noble&s;t, and, of cour&s;e, the mo&s;t acceptable &s;acrifice that a human creature can offer to the great author of good. Mr. Addi&s;on very ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a mind, which has the lea&s;t turn to religion, naturally flies to it in affliction."</Q>
We then feel our own in&s;ufficiency; we are humbled by &s;orrow, and perhaps only then deduce real &s;atis|faction from a thorough conviction, that there is a &s;uperior Being, who&s;e aid is graciou&s;ly pro|mi&s;ed to tho&s;e who &s;incerely &s;eek it. But, &s;ur|rounded by the delights of life, youth, fortune, gaiety, and di&s;&s;ipation, we too frequently be|come forgetful of the &s;ource, from whence our ble&s;&s;ings flow; and while we are indulging all our appetites in the delicious &s;tream of happine&s;s, it becomes impregnated with the qualities of Lethe, and renders us unmindful of its foun|tain.</P>
<P>BUT let me be truly thankful, that the &s;i&s;ter of my love, the child of my care, is not only
<PB N="35" REF="35">
ble&s;&s;ed with the in&s;ignia of happine&s;s, but with a heart capable of the fir&s;t virtue, gratitude; which, I hope, will en&s;ure to her the long, and full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all earthly good.</P>
<P>I NOW can tell my dear prophete&s;s, her hopes are accompli&s;hed.&mdash;The mother's fears are lo&s;t in the happy certainty of my children's perfect recovery.&mdash;But the friend &s;till &s;uffers:&mdash;poor Lucy continues extremely ill, though, thank God, this day pronounced out of danger. The &s;mall-pox was as favourable to her, as po&s;&s;ible; but the emotions of her mind, on account of that wretch, Sir James Miller, has thrown her into a violent fever.</P>
<P>HE is, this day, to be married to Mi&s;s Nel|&s;on! This &s;he is yet ignorant of; but on the fir&s;t day that &s;he &s;at up, &s;he received a kind of leave-taking letter from him, excu&s;ing his perfidy, by her want of complai&s;ance to his reque&s;t. Said,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he had rea&s;on to apprehend, that a lady, who &s;eemed &s;o little inclined to oblige him before marriage, would not make a very complying wife;&mdash;that he was glad to hear her beauty out of danger, as there was no doubt, but it would procure her a better hu&s;band than him; and that he &s;hould endeavour to look out for a wife, who was le&s;s anxious about her fea|tures."</Q>
Was there ever any thing &s;o provok|ing! This is adding in&s;olence to ba&s;ene&s;s!</P>
<P>IF Sir John was here I am &s;ure a duel would en&s;ue.&mdash;I know not how to act in this affair.&mdash;I cannot bear the thoughts of his triumphing in his villainy; nor yet can I think of hazarding Sir John's life, to puni&s;h &s;uch a &s;coundrel. Swift &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The <HI>occa&s;ions</HI> are few, that can in|duce a man of &s;en&s;e and virtue to draw his &s;word."</Q>
I am certain, were he living, he would allow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> to be a ju&s;tifiable <HI>one.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="36">BUT as a wife and mother, I mo&s;t &s;incerely hope, Sir John may never hear of his infamous behaviour: but what excu&s;e to invent, for break|ing off the match, I know not. Sir John is jea|lous of his honour, and will inquire minutely in|to the affair. I will refer it all to Lucy's pru|dence: &s;he loves her brother, and is a chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>YOU are an admirable painter. I &s;hould have known lord Seymour's picture, if you had not &s;et the name to it; all but that &s;hade of melan|choly, which you had thrown over it. He was extremely lively when I knew him; but I have not &s;een him, &s;ince his return to England.</P>
<P>YOU have made me perfectly acquainted with Sir James Thornton: I &s;aw his precipitate &s;tride into your dre&s;&s;ing-room, and his &s;hort &s;top on finding you were writing. It reminded me of the &s;napping of a watch-&s;pring. Have you ever had one break in your hand? Lucy has ju&s;t awoke from a refre&s;hing &s;leep, and, on being told I was writing, &s;he de&s;ires to &s;ee me immedi|ately.&mdash;I will return to you, again.</P>
<P>WHAT an affecting interview! That odious idiot, Sir James Miller, has,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"like the ba&s;e In|dian, thrown a pearl away, richer than all his tribe."</Q>
When I went into Lucy's chamber, &s;he de&s;ired every one to withdraw: then taking my hand, and pre&s;&s;ing it to her lips, what infi|nite trouble mu&s;t I have given to the compa&s;&s;ion|ate heart of my dear lady Straffon! but I hope you do not de&s;pi&s;e me: it was the weak &s;tate of my body, that overpowered my mind. But now, that I have recovered my &s;en&s;es, I am amazed how I could be affected by the lo&s;s of &s;uch a man.&mdash;Did I &s;ay lo&s;s? then I fear, I rave again. But I grieved for an ideal character; and am much obliged to Sir James, for removing the mi&s;t from before my eyes, and &s;hewing him|&s;elf
<PB N="37" REF="37">
in his native colours. How happy the delu&s;ion vani&s;hed &s;o &s;oon! Had it continued but a little longer, I &s;hould have been a wretch indeed! What a mi&s;ery, to de&s;pi&s;e the man, whom it is our duty to love and honour! Yet &s;uch might have been my fate! &s;hould I have been unpar|donably criminal, my deare&s;t &s;i&s;ter?</P>
<P>I INTREATED her not to think upon the &s;ubject, but to calm her &s;pirits; and that I would conver&s;e with her on any other topic, that &s;he plea&s;ed.&mdash;She begged my attention for a few minutes; &s;aid &s;he had wandered from her purpo&s;e, and a&s;ked my pardon for detaining me. You are writing, lady Straffon; perhaps to my brother. Then rai&s;ing her&s;elf on her knees, in &s;pite of my efforts to hinder her, let me, in this humble po&s;ture, intreat you, my deare&s;t &s;i&s;ter, not to mention what has pa&s;&s;ed to Sir John. I know his natural bravery, joined to his love for an only &s;i&s;ter, would tempt him to call Sir James Miller to an account.&mdash;Good God! what might be the con&s;equence! He has done me no wrong; and &s;hould any misfortune happen to my brother from this event, I could not an&s;wer for my &s;en&s;es. And were even the aggre&s;&s;or, for &s;uch indeed he is, to fall, I never &s;hould know peace again.</P>
<P>HERE &s;he was quite overcome by weakne&s;s, and &s;unk down in a &s;tood of tears. I &s;aid every thing in my power to a&s;&s;uage her grief; and gave her the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances, that I neither did, or would mention a &s;yllable of the affair to Sir John. She told me then, I had re&s;tored her tranquility; and &s;he &s;hould &s;oon be well, and able to contrive &s;ome plau&s;ible pretence to her brother, for breaking off the match: and as this would be the fir&s;t fal&s;hood &s;he had ever told him, &s;he hoped it might be con&s;idered as a <HI>pious fraud,</HI> only.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="38">AFTER this conver&s;ation, &s;he grew perfectly compo&s;ed; I left her retired to re&s;t: but I fear &s;he has di&s;turbed mine, for this night. What an amiable heart is hers? While yet &s;marting with unde&s;erved wounds, &s;he would pre&s;erve the cruel wretch who inflicted them! I will religiou&s;ly keep my promi&s;e to her; yet cannot help &s;in|cerely wi&s;hing, that his crime may be his pu|ni&s;hment; and, I think, he bids fair for being overpaid in kind.</P>
<P>MISS Nel&s;on, now lady Miller, is at lea&s;t twenty-nine, and has been a remarkable coquette the&s;e ten years; yet never could catch a poor unguarded fly in her net, till Sir James ru&s;hed in.&mdash;She was perfectly acquainted with his at|tachment to Lucy; had reque&s;ted to be her bride|maid; yet could think of &s;eparating them for ever! May they be mutual avengers of each other's perfidy!</P>
<P>I FEEL my&s;elf in an unchri&s;tian mood; I can|not help it; I pity folly, but dete&s;t vice! Alas! my Emily, I am too &s;evere; for they are, in general, &s;ynonimous terms. I will, in charity, wi&s;h you good night; for if I write on, I &s;hall rail more: therefore, Adieu,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY dear FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM &s;o violently provoked at the in&s;olent ba&s;ene&s;s of that abominable Miller, that I cannot find words to expre&s;s my re&s;entment. I do not think you &s;eem &s;ufficiently rejoiced at
<PB N="39" REF="39">
Lucy's e&s;cape from &s;uch a mon&s;ter: for my part, I am delighted at the thoughts of his being mar|ried to &s;uch a woman as Mi&s;s Nel&s;on&mdash;May &s;he render him ju&s;t as mi&s;erable as he de&s;erves to be!&mdash;His greate&s;t enemy could not wi&s;h him wor&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT there are more wretches in the world, than he; and Lucy is not without companions in affliction. The willow grows on purpo&s;e for our &s;ex; and were it to be watered, only by the tears drawn from beauteous eyes, by the perfidy of men, it would need no other moi&s;ture. Poor lady Harriet! an accident has di&s;covered the cau&s;e of her too frequent &s;ighs</P>
<P>YESTERDAY morning after breakfa&s;t, when the gentlemen had retired to their &s;eperate amu&s;e|ments, lady Harriet, Mi&s;s We&s;ton, and I, were in my dre&s;&s;ing-room. Lady Harriet took up Prior's Poems, and was reading Henry and Em|ma, to Fanny and me, who were at work; when in ru&s;hed lady Ransford, in a riding dre&s;s, and begged I would permit her to introduce a gentle|man, an acquaintance of her's, whom &s;he acci|dentally met on the road, as &s;he was coming to &s;pend the day with me. She concluded, he was a particular friend, whom &s;he had not &s;een for a long time. I immediately con&s;ented; and &s;aid I was &s;orry my lord was not at home, to receive the gentleman.</P>
<P>SHE ran out directly, and led in Captain Bar|nard.&mdash;While &s;he was pre&s;enting him to me, the book fell from Lady Harriet's hand, and &s;he &s;unk motionle&s;s upon the couch. As &s;oon as the captain ca&s;t his eyes on her, he appeared almo&s;t in the &s;ame condition: the colour for&s;ook his lips, and he could hardly breathe. Lady Rans|ford looked with a &s;piteful kind of a&s;toni&s;hment, and cried out, What can all this mean! is &s;he &s;ubject to fits? Fanny, and I, were engaged in
<PB N="40" REF="40">
trying to recover lady Harriet, I began to fear in vain&mdash;Life &s;eemed, for &s;ome minutes, ab&s;o|lutely fled&mdash;The wretched captain looked the picture of de&s;pair.&mdash;The moment &s;he opened her eyes, he bowed, left the room, mounted his hor&s;e, and rode off.</P>
<P>WE conveyed lady Harriet to her chamber, and laid her on the bed; when a plentiful &s;hower of tears &s;eemed to have relieved her. I left Fan|ny We&s;ton with her, and returned to lady Rans|ford. She &s;eemed in a violent pa&s;&s;ion, that the captain was gone&mdash;What has he to do with lady Harriet's faintings? She was very &s;ure it was only an air &s;he gave her&s;elf. She thanked God, &s;he was not &s;ubject to &s;uch tricks. She never fainted in her life, and was quite certain &s;he never &s;hould, &amp;c &amp;c.</P>
<P>I CONGRATULATED her on the goodne&s;s of her con&s;titution; &s;aid lady Harriet's was extreme|ly delicate, and that &s;he had not been well for &s;ome time. This did not &s;atisfy her; and &s;he continued out of humour at the captain's de&s;er|tion, the whole day; &s;everal times repeating, I do not &s;uppo&s;e he ever &s;aw her before; of what con&s;equence was her fainting to him? and I en|couraged her in this opinion, though far from believing it.</P>
<P>I SAID, his retiring was a mark of politene&s;s, as the pre&s;ence of a &s;tranger mu&s;t increa&s;e the confu&s;ion we were in. Nothing that I &s;aid could pacify her. I therefore &s;uffered her to mutter out her di&s;&s;atisfaction without replying, for the remainder of the time &s;he &s;taid, which was not long after dinner.&mdash;She &s;aid &s;he &s;hould be afraid to ride with only one &s;ervant, after it was du&s;k.</P>
<P>I NEVER was better plea&s;ed with the depar|ture of a gue&s;t. I longed to &s;ee poor Harriet,
<PB N="41" REF="41">
who had not left her rooom, and flew to her the moment lady Ransford was gone. She looked aba&s;hed, and held down her lovely eyes, which were yet bathed in tears, when I approached her;&mdash;but the tenderne&s;s with which I inquired concerning her health, &s;eemed to re-a&s;&s;ure her.</P>
<P>YOU are too good to me, my dear lady Wood|ville; &s;uch weakne&s;s as mine &s;carcely de&s;erves your compa&s;&s;ion: and I can only pre&s;ume to hope for it, by the mo&s;t unbounded confidence, which I &s;hould long &s;ince have repo&s;ed in your friendly bo&s;om, but that I thought it cruel, even for a moment, to interrupt that happine&s;s which you &s;o well de&s;erve. But as the accident which hap|pened this day, mu&s;t convince you, that there is a &s;ecret &s;orrow which preys upon my heart, I will readily acquaint you with the cau&s;e of it, le&s;t the tenderne&s;s of your nature &s;hould make you imagine me more wretched than I really am.</P>
<P>YOU mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, my dear, &s;aid I, that your &s;ituation, this morning, alarmed me extremely; but I have long thought there was &s;ome &s;ecret &s;ource for that &s;oft melancholy, which you vainly endeavour to repre&s;ent as con&s;titutional. But do not let this remark make you think your&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;clo&s;ing your &s;ecrets to me. I am far from de&s;iring to pry into them: but &s;hould rejoice at having it in my power to do any thing, which might alleviate your di&s;tre&s;s. And if my participation of your &s;orrow can footh it, but for a moment, it will more than repay me, for what I feel, in knowing that you are unhappy.</P>
<P>SHE &s;aid, &s;he was not then capable of making the lea&s;t return to my kindne&s;s, though perfectly &s;en&s;ible of it; but that, as &s;oon as &s;he was able, &s;he would write out her &s;hort &s;tory for me, and lady Straffon. She &s;aid, Lucy knew &s;omething of it, but not the whole; and de&s;ired &s;he might

Change of air, and objects, will forward her recovery. Why cannot you, and the little ones, accompany her, and complete the wi&s;hes of</P>

<P>AS the &s;tronge&s;t mark of my &s;incerity and gra|titude, to my dear lady Woodville, for all her kindne&s;s to me, I &s;it down to fulfil the voluntary promi&s;e I made, of acquainting her with the few events of a &s;hort life, who&s;e duration has only been marked by &s;orrow; and as, <Q REND="inline">"to men|tion, is to &s;uffer pain,"</Q> I cho&s;e to &s;ave her gen|tle heart the unea&s;ine&s;s of &s;eeing the di&s;tre&s;s, which the recollection of unhappy circum&s;tances, mu&s;t ever revive, where the &s;ufferer is the re|later. I mu&s;t now, like all biographers, &s;tep a little back, to give you &s;ome account of the authors of my being, and then proceed with a plain narrative, &s;ubmitting my weakne&s;&s;es and follies, without the lea&s;t re&s;erve, to your friend|ly eye.</P>
<P>MY father was elde&s;t &s;on to the Earl of G&mdash;. During my grandfather's life, he be|came pa&s;&s;ionately in love with my mother, who was a daughter of colonel Stanley's, and reputed one of the greate&s;t beauties of that time. My father well knew it would be in vain to hope for the earl's con&s;ent to his marrying, without a large fortune, let the merits of the lady be ever &s;o great; as his e&s;tate was extremely involved, and that he had four children by a &s;econd wife, un|provided for.</P>
<P>MY mother's portion was only four thou&s;and pounds, but her father, who con&s;idered her birth, beauty, and accompli&s;hments, as full equivalents to any fortune, when he found the earl was not acquainted with my father's court&s;hip, forbade his daughter ever to &s;ee her lover more, as his pride would not &s;uffer him to have matched her with a prince, clande&s;tinely.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="44">THE lovers reduced to this unhappy &s;ituation, after much fruitle&s;s &s;orrow, had recour&s;e to the u&s;ual alternative, and married without con&s;ent on either &s;ide. The affair was not long kept &s;e|cret, and the earl, who&s;e rage was without bounds, accu&s;ed the colonel of being privy to the marriage, and of drawing in his &s;on&mdash;he al&s;o lavi&s;hed every kind of abu&s;e upon my mother, and &s;topt the allowance he had for &s;ome years given to my father.</P>
<P>THE colonel, though highly offended with his daughter, re&s;ented the cruelty and inju&s;tice of the earl's behaviour, and &s;ent him a challenge&mdash;The duel was prevented by my father's addre&s;s, but the mo&s;t implacable hatred ever remained, between the old gentlemen; which communi|cated it&s;elf to every branch of the families, ex|cept my father and mother, who were the mo&s;t perfect patterns of conjugal tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING my father's encrea&s;|ing fondne&s;s for his lovely wife, the unhappy feuds, which &s;he thought her&s;elf the occa&s;ion of, preyed on her tender mind, and &s;o much weak|ened her delicate frame, that, giving me life, &s;he lo&s;t her own;&mdash;fatal exchange for her unhappy orphan! My father was quite di&s;tracted at her lo&s;s, and the colonel, who had been reconciled to them both, for &s;ome time, was obliged to re|&s;train his own affliction, to endeavour to con&s;ole my father, and engage him to pre&s;erve his life, by frequently pre&s;enting me before him.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"YES, he would then &s;ay, I will live for the protection of that only tran&s;cript of my angel Harriet. I will watch over her ri&s;ing virtues, and endeavour to re&s;tore to the world, &s;ome part of that perfection, my cruel father has deprived it of."</Q>
For four years, his fondne&s;s
<PB N="45" REF="45">
for me <HI>was</HI> unabated, and I appeared to be the &s;ole object of his attention and regard.</P>
<P>ABOUT that aera, the earl wrote to him, and a reconciliation &s;oon en&s;ued; the terms of which were, that as my father had gratified him&s;elf by his fir&s;t marriage, he &s;hould oblige the earl, and &s;erve his family, by a &s;econd. My father, who&s;e nature was gentle, was &s;oon induced to comply, and, as I believe his real fondne&s;s for my mother, had rendered all women indifferent to him, the choice of his future lady was entirely left to the earl, who, you may &s;uppo&s;e, would rate her va|lue, only by her fortune. My father paid his ad|dre&s;&s;es in form, and even without the lea&s;t degree of liking on either &s;ide the match was concluded.</P>
<P>THE perpetual &s;cenes of di&s;cord which &s;uc|ceeded to this ill-&s;uited marriage, are but too pub|lic, and I have great rea&s;on to apprehend, that, to this con&s;tant &s;ource of dome&s;tic mi&s;ery, I owe the lo&s;s of my unhappy father. The fir&s;t cau&s;e of di&s;gu&s;t, my &s;tep-mother gave him was her ab&s;olutely refu&s;ing to let me be brought into the hou&s;e, politely adding, that &s;he would not &s;uffer a <HI>beggar's brat,</HI> to be brought up with her chil|dren, who were at lea&s;t entitled to a fortune, by their mother's &s;ide; and that tho&s;e who had no|thing but their blood to boa&s;t of, &s;hould be bred humble to lower their pride. This one &s;pecimen is, I think, &s;ufficient to give you a perfect idea of my poor father's unhappine&s;s, and I &s;hall &s;ay nothing more, of one, who has the honour to bear his name, and title.</P>
<P>I REMAINED at my grandfather's, and was his principal favourite. My father continued to &s;ee me frequently, and, notwith&s;tanding his fa|mily was increa&s;ed, by the birth of a &s;on, and two daughters, his fondne&s;s for me appeared undimi|ni&s;hed&mdash;but neither his lady, nor the earl, ever
<PB N="46" REF="46">
took the lea&s;t notice of me&mdash;my father's &s;i&s;ter, lady Woodville, was extremely kind to me, and even pre&s;&s;ed my grandfather to let me live with her, but he refu&s;ed to part with the only joy he had on earth, and &s;he died before him.</P>
<P>WHEN I was about fourteen, I was deprived of my affectionate, and tender parent, the good old colonel.&mdash;Before he died, he recommended me, in the mo&s;t affecting terms, to my father, who promi&s;ed every thing in my favour, that he could de&s;ire; but &s;eemed offended that the colo|nel &s;hould think it nece&s;&s;ary to plead for his dear|e&s;t, be&s;t beloved child, the child of his affecti|on, the child of his ever adored, and lamented Harriet. Fully &s;atisfied with the&s;e a&s;&s;urances, the good old man re&s;igned his &s;oul in peace, leaving me all his per&s;onal fortune, which amounted to about &s;ix thou&s;and pound; his paternal e&s;tate being entailed on a male heir.</P>
<P>LADY Anne We&s;trop, who was a di&s;tant re|lation of my mother's, invited me to live with her, and in the &s;ociety of this agreeable woman, I began to recover my natural chearfulne&s;s, which had been totally ob&s;orbed by the grief I felt for my grandfather's ill health and death.&mdash;During a year, that we pa&s;&s;ed entirely at her &s;eat in the country, I knew not one moment's unea&s;ine&s;s&mdash;my mind was like a peaceful ocean, who&s;e every motion was uniformly gentle, without one ruffling breeze to di&s;turb, or deform it; yet &s;uf|ficiently actuated to prevent languor or di&s;gu&s;t, the &s;tagnation of the &s;oul.</P>
<P>How often have I looked back, with regret, upon this plea&s;ing calm! which was, alas! too &s;oon &s;ucceeded by impetuous &s;torms, where all my peace was &s;hipwrecked. About the end of this happy aera, captain Barnard came to pay a vi&s;it to his &s;i&s;ter, lady Anne; he is younge&s;t &s;on
<PB N="47" REF="47">
to the Earl of W&mdash;. He was de&s;igned for the navy, and his father was at that time &s;olli|citing a &s;hip, which he &s;oon obtained for him. I &s;hall not take up your lady&s;hip's time, by giving you an account of our childi&s;h court&s;hip, but tell you, at once, that,
<Q><LG>
<L><HI>A mutual flame was quickly caught,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Was quickly too reveal'd,</HI></L>
<L><HI>For neither bo&s;om lodg'd a wi&s;h,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Which virtue keeps conceal'd.</HI></L>

<LG>
<L><HI>What happy hours of heart-felt bli&s;s,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Did love on both be&s;tow!</HI></L>
<L><HI>But bli&s;s too mighty long to la&s;t,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Where fortune proves a foe.</HI></L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>IN the mid&s;t of the&s;e truly Arcadian plea&s;ures, the earl, my grandfather, died; which I can by no means &s;ay di&s;turbed my happine&s;s; but alas! it was to be interrupted by a &s;everer &s;hock; for my father &s;urvived him but eleven days; the &s;ix thou&s;and pounds, which colonel Stanley had bequeathed to me, were in my father's hands, his e&s;tate was all &s;ettled upon the i&s;&s;ue of his &s;e|cond marriage, and his debts amounted to rather more than his per&s;onal fortune; &s;o that there re|mained not a &s;hilling for me, even of my grand|father's legacy, without going to law with the counte&s;s, my &s;tep-mother, who had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her|&s;elf of every thing my father left.</P>
<P>I GRIEVED only for his lo&s;s, that of my for|tune appearing, then, of <HI>no</HI> con&s;equence; my lover &s;eemed to redouble his tenderne&s;s for me, but thought, circum&s;tanced as I then was, it would be prudent to conceal our pa&s;&s;ion, as it was highly probable, his friends might oppo&s;e our union. I acquie&s;ced in his opinion, and re&s;ted all my
<PB N="48" REF="48">
hopes of happine&s;s on him,&mdash;unworthy guardian of that &s;acred tru&s;t!</P>
<P>WHEN the time for his leaving the We&s;t-hill arrived, I then di&s;covered that I had never known &s;orrow before; it was impo&s;&s;ible to conceal my angui&s;h, and lady Ann We&s;trop, who had taken great pains to comfort me for the death of my father, and imagined, not without rea&s;on, that my grief had &s;ub&s;ided into a calm, and gentle me|lancholy, &s;eemed a&s;toni&s;hed at the violence of my affliction; but I might have an&s;wered her with the words of Helena,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I think not on my father, and the&s;e great tears do grace his me|mory more than tho&s;e I &s;hed for him"</Q></P>
<P>HOWEVER, I thought it very lucky, that my late misfortune appeared a &s;ufficient cau&s;e for my pre&s;ent melancholy, which I indulged to &s;uch an exce&s;s, as &s;oon affected my con&s;titution, and I was ordered by my phy&s;ician to Bri&s;tol Lady Anne, ever kind, and affectionate towards me, accompanied me thither, and Mr. We&s;trop went to London, to con&s;ult lawyers about the recovery of my fortune.</P>
<P>THE frequency and tenderne&s;s of captain Bar|nard's letter contributed much more to the re&s;to|ration of my health, than all the waters of tho&s;e &s;alubrious &s;prings; and lady Anne expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch &s;incere joy at my recovery, that I, romantic as I was, thought my&s;elf bound in honour, to ac|quaint her with the real cau&s;e of it. I thought con|cealing any thing from &s;uch a friend, was <HI>acting a lie,</HI> and in the fullne&s;s of my gratitude I poured forth all the &s;ecrets of my heart</P>
<P>SHE heard me with that &s;ort of coldne&s;s with which one li&s;tens to a twice told tale, yet, at the &s;ame time, a&s;&s;ured me, &s;he had never &s;u&s;pected any attachment between her brother and me; &s;aid &s;he wi&s;hed, for both our &s;akes, we could
<PB N="49" REF="49">
conquer our pa&s;&s;ion, for &s;he was certain it could only be productive of mi&s;ery to both.</P>
<P>I WAS equally piqued at her manner and ex|pre&s;&s;ion, and replied with &s;ome warmth, that as I con&s;idered my&s;elf under very great obligations to her, I would not entail mi&s;ery on any part of her family, let my own fate be what it would. She applauded my re&s;olution, with the &s;ame <HI>&s;ang froid,</HI> with which &s;he had heard my &s;tory, and I retired from her apartment, to my own, more humbled and mortified than I had ever been in my life.</P>
<P>I PASSED a mo&s;t re&s;tle&s;s, mi&s;erable night, &s;ometimes re&s;olving on the highe&s;t genero&s;ity to break with captain Barnard,&mdash;the next moment repeating vows of everla&s;ting love&mdash;but at all events I determined to quit lady Anne, yet whi|ther &s;hould I go? where fly to? a wretched or|phan, without friends or fortune!</P>
<P>THE agitation of my mind at length &s;ub&s;ided, and towards morning I fell into a profound &s;lum|ber. As I &s;lept much longer than u&s;ual, I found lady Anne's woman by my bed &s;ide, when I awoke, who &s;aid &s;he came from her lady, to inquire my health, and to reque&s;t that I would go to her immediately.</P>
<P>I OBEYED the &s;ummons in&s;tantly, and while I was hurrying on my cloaths, flattered my&s;elf that &s;he had relented of her unkindne&s;s, and wi&s;hed again to re&s;tore me to that &s;i&s;terly af|fection, which &s;he &s;eemed &s;o long to have felt for me, and yet to have lo&s;t in one moment; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with this imagination I ran, or rather flew to her apartment but on opening the door, was &s;urprized to &s;ee Lord N&mdash;, who appeared very earne&s;t in conver&s;ation with her lady&s;hip.</P>
<P>THIS gentleman had been very particular to me, ever &s;ince our re&s;idence at Bri&s;tol; he was
<PB N="50" REF="50">
young, polite, and ma&s;ter of a large indepen|dent fortune; but the&s;e advantages had made me rather decline, than encourage his acquaintance, le&s;t the bu&s;y tongues of men, or rather women, might have pronounced him a lover&mdash;an epithet, which is of all others mo&s;t hateful to a delicate, pre-engaged heart.</P>
<P>On my entrance, the conver&s;ation became general. Lady Anne affected to treat me with her u&s;ual tenderne&s;s, but I too plainly &s;aw, that &s;he only affected it. After &s;ome little time &s;he withdrew abruptly, and left me alone with lord N&mdash;. A thou&s;and di&s;agreeable things ru&s;hed into my mind at once, but above all, I feared a declaration of love from his lord&s;hip, which, though I was determined to refu&s;e, mu&s;t have di&s;tre&s;&s;ed me extremely, as I could not to the world, a&s;&s;ign any ju&s;tifiable cau&s;e for my refu&s;al.</P>
<P>I ROSE from my &s;eat with trepidation, and rang the bell for breakfa&s;t. I hoped this would be a hint for his lord&s;hip to retire&mdash;on the con|trary, he &s;aid, it was very fortunate for him that I called for tea, as he had not touched any thing but a gla&s;s of water, that day, and &s;hould have ab&s;olutely forgot that eating was ne|ce&s;&s;ary, if I had not reminded him of it; but &s;ince I had, he hoped I would allow him the ho|nour of breakfa&s;ting with me.</P>
<P>I COOLLY bowed a&s;&s;ent, and the moment the tea table was removed, &s;aid I mu&s;t retire, to put on my riding dre&s;s, as I had promi&s;ed to meet a lady on the downs, and feared I &s;hould keep her waiting. Lord N&mdash; &s;aw my confu|&s;ion, pitied and believed it, by &s;aying he would not tre&s;pa&s;s farther on my lei&s;ure, but hoped I would permit him the honour of paying me a vi&s;it in the afternoon: he did not wait for my reply, and I thought my&s;elf infinitely obliged to
<PB N="51" REF="51">
him, for even po&s;tponing the embara&s;&s;ment, in which I knew I &s;hould be too &s;oon involved.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as lady Anne and I were alone, af|ter dinner &s;he congratulated me, with a &s;erious air, on the important conque&s;t I had made, enu|merated the great advantages of &s;uch a match, and &s;aid &s;he was rejoiced to find, by the ea&s;e and propriety of my behaviour, that the &s;illy pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion I had talked of the night before, had not rendered me &s;o romantically ab&s;urd, as to re|ject happine&s;s, and lord N&mdash;, or to per&s;i&s;t in embracing mi&s;ery, and captain Barnard.</P>
<P>THOUGH I had in &s;ome mea&s;ure prepared my&s;elf to hear her &s;peak on this &s;ubject, yet I could not avoid feeling the utmo&s;t &s;urprize at her want of delicacy, in mentioning the man whom I profe&s;&s;ed to love, at the &s;ame in&s;tant that &s;he approved my accepting of another.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as I recovered my&s;elf, I told her that I was neither intitled to her congratulation, or approbation, as lord N&mdash; had never &s;aid any thing upon &s;uch a &s;ubject to me, and that I hoped he never would, as I &s;hould be very &s;orry to give him the mortification of a denial; but at the &s;ame time, that I fled from what <HI>&s;he</HI> called happine&s;s, I hoped I &s;hould find what I thought &s;o in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having acted right; for though I never could dive&s;t my&s;elf of the tendere&s;t attachment to captain Barnard, yet I could &s;acrifice my hopes of any future connection with him to his advantage, and her de&s;ire.</P>
<P>LADY Anne took me at my word, prai&s;ed my genero&s;ity, and intreated I would take time to con&s;ider, before I refu&s;ed lord N&mdash;. I a&s;&s;ured her, that delay was unnece&s;&s;ary; and as I had a very high e&s;teem for his lord&s;hip, and was &s;in|cerely grateful, for the honour he intended me, I could not think of trifling with his peace, or
<PB N="52" REF="52">
meanly accepting a heart, becau&s;e &s;et in gold, when it was ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible for me to make the only return which &s;uch a valuable pre&s;ent de&s;erved. She called me dear, romantic, gene|rous girl; &s;aid &s;he had no doubt but time and rea&s;on would conquer my childi&s;h pa&s;&s;ion, and that &s;he &s;hould rejoice to &s;ee me happy with &s;ome worthy man; but &s;till intreated me, not to act precipitately, with regard to lord N&mdash;, as &s;he feared I might never have &s;uch another offer.</P>
<P>THIS kind of conver&s;ation la&s;ted till lord N&mdash; came to vi&s;it us, and I now wi&s;hed for his making that delaration I &s;o much dreaded in the morning. I was determined, on the con|duct I &s;hould pur&s;ue towards him, and &s;ecretly triumphed in the &s;acrifice I &s;hould make to my truly di&s;intere&s;ted love for captain Barnard. However, her lady&s;hip took care that we &s;hould not &s;o immediately come to an explanation, for &s;he never left us the whole evening. Lord N&mdash; appeared to be chagrined; and I was al&s;o ex|tremely mortified that the affair was not brought to a conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE next day, I received a letter from Mr. We&s;trop, informing me that my &s;tep-mother had con&s;ented to give me four thou&s;and pounds, rather than &s;tand a law &s;uit, for the &s;ix which my grand-father left me. In con&s;ideration of this &s;um, I was to relinqui&s;h all farther claim to my father's fortune, and to receive it as a pre&s;ent from her bounty. The&s;e terms I thought ex|tremely hard; but to attempt carrying on an expen&s;ive &s;uit, without money appeared imprac|ticable. It is true, Mr. We&s;trop in the mo&s;t friendly manner, offered to advance any &s;um I might have occa&s;ion for; but I already felt the <HI>weight</HI> of my obligation to lady Anne, and de|termined not to increa&s;e <HI>the load.</HI> I therefore
<PB N="53" REF="53">
complied with the&s;e &s;evere conditions: but as I was not of age, Mr. We&s;trop became &s;ecurity for my part of the contract, and the intere&s;t of this &s;plendid &s;um was allotted for my mainte+nance.</P>
<P>ON this occa&s;ion, lady Anne behaved with the utmo&s;t kindne&s;s towards me; begged I would con&s;ider her as my &s;i&s;ter, and never think of quitting her hou&s;e, till I went to one of my own. She made me &s;everal valuable pre&s;ents, which I received with the utmo&s;t reluctance; yet could not refu&s;e, as her manner of be&s;towing them was peculiarly polite and tender. In &s;hort, &s;he did every thing in her power, to conciliate that true e&s;teem, and affection, which her conduct, with regard to captain Barnard, had for a while re&s;trained.</P>
<P>LORD N&mdash; &s;oon found an opportunity to di&s;clo&s;e his pa&s;&s;ion for me; and I as quickly put an end to all his hopes. He thanked me for the generous frankne&s;s of my conduct, and earne&s;tly intreated to &s;ee me as a friend, though I had de|nied him as a lover. I readily con&s;ented to his reque&s;t, and have ever found him a mo&s;t amia|ble and worthy man.</P>
<P>I HAD not received a letter from captain Bar|nard for near a month.&mdash;He was &s;tationed in the Mediterranean: and though determined, sa &s;oon as he returned to England, to take an everla&s;ting leave of him, I grew impatient at his &s;ilence, and longed to return to We&s;thill, to retrace tho&s;e paths we had trod together, and woo &s;weet echo to repeat his name. I knew lady Anne received foreign letters frequently, &s;ome of which I &s;up|po&s;ed were from captain Barnard; but as &s;he was &s;ilent on the &s;ubject of them, I did not think it proper to appear inqui&s;itive; and &s;ome weeks elap&s;ed, without &s;uffering that name to pa&s;s my
<PB N="54" REF="54">
lips, which was but too deeply engraved on my heart.</P>
<P>AT length the time for our departure came, and we arrived at We&s;thill.&mdash;The morning after, I ro&s;e very early, in order to indulge the fond idea of revi&s;iting tho&s;e woods and lawns, where I had &s;pent &s;o many happy hours. I did not imagine any of the family were &s;tirring, and went &s;oftly into lady Anne's dre&s;&s;ing room, where all the Engli&s;h poets lay, to take a book with me into the garden. I &s;tarted at finding her there. Her &s;urprize at &s;eeing me, equalled mine: but quickly recovering her&s;elf, &s;he talked of the finene&s;s of the morning, which &s;he &s;aid had tempted her to leave her bed &s;o &s;oon; but that finding the dew was not off the gra&s;s, &s;he had &s;at down to write letters.</P>
<P>A PROPOS, &s;aid &s;he; I have had one in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for you the&s;e ten days; but as I did not know whether the contents might be perfectly agreeable to you, I cho&s;e to defer delivering it, till we were quite free from ob&s;ervers. I flatter my&s;elf, madam, &s;aid I, that your precaution was unnece&s;&s;ary, if, as I apprehend,, the letter comes from captain Barnard. Lady Anne re|plied, do not be too &s;anguine, my dear; we feel our di&s;appointments, in proportion to our expec|tations. True, madam, I returned; but as the height of mine at pre&s;ent, extends only to know|ing that your brother is well and happy, do not protract on that account, but be &s;o good to let me have my letter.</P>
<P>SHE then pre&s;ented it to me, &s;aying, I believe you had better retire to your own apartment, before you read it. I willingly obeyed: but though all this preparation was &s;ufficient to alarm me, yet at the &s;ight of tho&s;e dear, well known characters, I forgot all that lady Anne had &s;aid,
<PB N="55" REF="55">
and broke the &s;eal with the highe&s;t tran&s;port. But before I had read half the following lines, I in reality &s;uffered the transformation, which Ovid &s;eigned for Niobe: my limbs were petri|fied; nor was the lea&s;t &s;ign of life or motion, remaining in me, but my flowing tears.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE ingratitude and unkindne&s;s of your behaviour towards me, de&s;erves &s;uch reproahes as I am incapable of making to a per&s;on I once truly loved. I ought to be thankful for your having cured me of that folly; but the man|ner of your doing it, takes away the merit of the obligation.</P>
<P>UNWORTHY Harriet! you might have cea&s;ed to love, without betraying, and expo|&s;ing the wretch who doated on you. Lord N&mdash;'s &s;uperior rank and fortune were temptations, I &s;carce could hope you &s;hould with&s;tand. But why, ingrate! &s;hould you de&s;pi&s;e and ridicule the fondne&s;s of that heart, where though you have planted daggers, there &s;till remains the warme&s;t wi&s;hes for your fu|ture happine&s;s.</P>
<P>It is now above two months &s;ince I have heard from you. This, cruel, this alarming &s;ilence, filled my fond bo&s;om with the tender|e&s;t &s;orrow. I had a thou&s;and fears for my loved Harriet. I feared &s;ome fatal accident might have befallen her. I feared every thing that could befall, except her breach of vows! The fidelity of my own heart prevented that &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>But I have done for ever on this &s;ubject: nor will I longer interrupt your felicity, than

<P>I HAVE got another &s;hip, and &s;hall u&s;e all my intere&s;t to prevent my return to England. Amid&s;t all the perils, to which my &s;ituation daily expo&s;es me, I wi&s;hed to pre&s;erve my life for your &s;ake only; but your perfidy has now rendered it of as little value to me, as it ever was to you: and to die nobly in the &s;er|vice of my country, is at pre&s;ent, the mo&s;t earne&s;t wi&s;h of,</P>

<P>I HAD remained for &s;ome hours in the &s;itu|ation I have already de&s;cribed, when lady Anne &s;ent her woman, to call me to breakfa&s;t. On finding my eyes fixed, and my whole frame immoveable, Mrs. Atkins &s;creamed &s;o loud, that lady Anne and Mr. We&s;trop ran into my dre&s;|&s;ing-room. I was immediately put into bed, and every care was taken for my recovery. A &s;low fever en&s;ued, which I daily hoped would termi|nate my life and mi&s;ery; but it plea&s;ed Provi|dence that I &s;hould be re&s;erved for greater woes.</P>

But as I was not in a &s;ituation to re&s;ent &s;uch cruelty, I thought it mo&s;t prudent to acqui|e&s;ce in &s;ilence, and wait till time, the great ex|pounder

of my&s;teries, &s;hould clear my innocence. She frequently ob&s;erved, that as I was determined to break with him, it would be better to let him remain in his error, than to come to an explana|tion, that could an&s;wer no end, as we were to part for ever. To this I could, by no means, a|gree. But, alas! it was not in my power to op|po&s;e her plea&s;ure. I neither knew the name of his &s;hip, nor the place of his de&s;tination; and I continued, for near twelve months, a prey to the mo&s;t cruel &s;u&s;pen&s;e.</P>
<P>AT this time lady Anne and Mr. We&s;trop pur|po&s;ed making the petit tour, and in&s;i&s;ted on my accompanying them.&mdash;I gladly accepted the of|fer; for I might truly &s;ay,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I had &s;uch perpe|tual &s;ource of di&s;quiet, in my own brea&s;t, that re&s;t was grown painful to me, and a &s;tate of agitation, only could afford me ca&s;e, by re&s;|cuing me, as it were, from my&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>THOUGH we &s;pent a month in London, to wait for the conclu&s;ion of the peace, I knew not where to make any enquiry after captain Bar|nard; nor had I a friend to whom I could ven|ture to repeat his name; and I &s;et out for Paris, much more inclined to enter into the mo&s;t gloomy &s;olitude than to partake of the plea&s;ures of that gay city.</P>
<P>THERE I became acquainted with lord Wood|ville, and there I al&s;o met Mrs. Bolton, who was nearly related to me, by my mother.&mdash;We had been acquainted from our infancy, and had a real friend&s;hip for each other; but her living in Ireland, where her hu&s;band had a very large fortune, had prevented our meeting for three years before. She was in a very declining &s;tate of health, and was going to Montpelier on that ac|count, when Mr. Bolton was obliged to &s;et out for Ireland, on the death of a near relation.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="58" MS="y">AS lady Anne was con&s;tantly engaged in the grande monde, I &s;pent much of my time with Mrs. Bolton, and with real &s;orrow &s;aw that ami|able woman growing wor&s;e every day.&mdash;Her phy&s;icians, at length, had her removed to Fon|tainbleau.&mdash;Ju&s;t then lady Anne grew weary of Paris, and re&s;olved to pur&s;ue her route. Poor Mrs. Bolton &s;hed a flood of tears, when I talked of quitting Paris, and intreated me not to leave her, <Q REND="inline">"a helple&s;s &s;tranger in a foreign land."</Q> Even her own maid had married one of the <HI>gens d'armes,</HI> and le&s;t her, &s;o that he had not a crea|ture about her, that had the lea&s;t regard or ten|derne&s;s for her. She &s;aid, a few days would put an end to the arduous ta&s;k &s;he required from my friend&s;hip, that of clo&s;ing her dying eyes: but that if Mr. Bolton &s;hould return before that hap|pened, her carriage and &s;ervants &s;hould convey me to lady Anne, or wherever I de&s;ired.</P>
<P>THERE was no re&s;i&s;ting her importunities; and lady Anne, though di&s;&s;atisfied at my &s;tay, applauded the noblene&s;s of my friend&s;hip, and took a very affectionate leave of me. I &s;aw her get into a carriage with &s;incere regret. I con&s;i|dered my&s;elf as torn from one who had been the friend and protectre&s;s of my youth. Her cruelty was forgot; and every act of kindne&s;s &s;he had ever &s;hewn me, returned with double force into my memory; and my heart and eyes overflow+ed with grateful tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>I WAS waiting in this &s;ituation of mind, for Mrs. Bolton's chariot to carry me to Fontain|bleau, when captain Barnard entered the room! I will not pretend to de&s;cribe the emotions of my heart; in &s;hort they were too &s;trong for my rea|&s;on, and &s;u&s;pended all its powers.&mdash;Never &s;ure was &s;uch a meeting! The extremes of love, &s;ur|prize, re&s;entment, joy, all operated on me.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="59">HE was all penitence, and love; kneeled at my feet, and bathed my hand with tears; plead|ed the violence of his di&s;tracted love, in excu&s;e for the cruel letter he had wrote, when he believ|ed me fal&s;e; and uttered the mo&s;t &s;olemn vows, that it I would again receive his heart, which never had &s;trayed one moment from me, no power on earth &s;hould ever part us more: but if I refu&s;ed to accept his love, he would in&s;tantly give up the command of his &s;hip, and retire to &s;ome part of the world, where he &s;hould never be heard of.</P>
<P>I WILL frankly confe&s;s, that all my tenderne&s;s for this unworthy man returned; and I even thought I loved him better than I had ever done before. He was then of age, and ma&s;ter of him|&s;elf; there remained, therefore, nothing to op|po&s;e <HI>our</HI> wi&s;hes, for I own them mutual, but the obligations I was under, and the voluntary pro|mi&s;e I had made to lady Anne. This objection he treated as romantic; but &s;aid, he would gra|tify my delicacy in this particular; and engaged to obtain her free con&s;ent.</P>
<P>HE attended me to Fontainbleau, and vi&s;ited me there, every day, during two months, that my amiable friend continued to langui&s;h.&mdash;At the end of that time, &s;he was relea&s;ed, and left me in &s;incere affliction. Mr. Bolton returned a few days before her death; and, &s;ome time af|ter, made me a pre&s;ent of part of her jewels, to the amount of two thou&s;and pounds.&mdash;I would have declined &s;o valuable a gift; but it was my dear Mrs. Bolton's dying reque&s;t, that I &s;hould have them.</P>
<P>AT captain Barnard's earne&s;t intreaty, I re|turned to Paris, where he &s;till continued to &s;olli|cit our marriage, and I to refu&s;e, till he had ful|filled his promi&s;e, with regard to lady Anne.&mdash;
<PB N="60" REF="60" MS="y">
At length, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">he extorted one from me, that even her oppo&s;ing it &s;hould not prevent our union; and, in an oblique manner, confe&s;&s;ed, that &s;he had been the cau&s;e of that letter which had given me &s;o much pain, by her mi&s;repre&s;entation of my conduct at Bri&s;tol. He that can plea&s;e is certain to per&s;uade; and I, at la&s;t, acquue&s;ced in his reque&s;t.</P>
<P>HE would not hear of my returning into Eng|land till we were married. I had no parent's con&s;ent to a&s;k, and he had wrote to the chaplain of his &s;hip to come and marry us. Seemingly po&s;&s;e&s;t with the tendere&s;t pa&s;&s;ion that ever warm|ed a human heart, he &s;et out for Aix la Cha|pelle, where we &s;uppo&s;ed lady Anne to be; but, unluckily. &s;he had left it two days before captain Barnard arrived, and was then returning to Eng|land. Thither the captain followed. I was ex|tremely concerned at this di&s;appointment; but it was only on account of the additional trouble and fatigue he was to undergo.</P>
<P>HE wrote to me the very po&s;t: nay, I was &s;ometimes &s;o happy, as to receive two or three letters wrote at different times of the &s;ame day, filled with the language of love, with fond com|plaints of ab&s;ence, and vows never to leave me more.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, blinded as I was by my own pa&s;|&s;ion, I could not help perceiving, that when he had been &s;ome time in England, the &s;tile of his letters began to change, though he &s;till continu|ed to complain of the cruel nece&s;&s;ity that detain|ed him; but not in that charming plaintive &s;tile, which u&s;ed, at once, to &s;often and delight my heart.</P>
<P>THREE months pa&s;&s;ed away, in this manner, during which time, I received a cold, but civil letter from lady Anne, congratulating me on
<PB N="61" REF="61">
the con&s;tancy of my lover, and thanking me for the needle&s;s compliment I had paid her, as &s;he was perfectly convinced we were too much in love, to follow any per&s;ons advice but our own.&mdash;Notwith&s;tanding this, &s;he very &s;incerely wi&s;h|ed my happine&s;s, whether I &s;hould, or &s;hould not become her &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>AS I found captain Barnard's return was &s;till protracted by his father's ill health, and many other rea&s;ons, that did not appear to me &s;uffici|ent, I began to be unea&s;y at my &s;ituation.&mdash;A &s;ingle wowan, without friends, or relations, in &s;uch a place as Paris, was, by no means, in an eligible &s;tate.&mdash;I had &s;ome acquaintance, and tho&s;e of di&s;tinction, who received me on lady Anne's account, without inquiring into the mo|tives of my &s;tay: but I felt a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that their civilities were more the effect of politene&s;s, than e&s;teem, which rendered me unhappy; and I wrote to captain Barnard, reque&s;ting his per|mi&s;&s;ion to return to England, if he did not in|tend to come to Paris immediately.</P>
<P>MY letter lay &s;ealed, and directed, on my dre&s;|&s;ing-table, when lord N&mdash; came to make me a vi&s;it; and ca&s;ting his eyes on the letter, &s;aid, I might &s;pare my&s;elf the trouble of &s;ending it to the po&s;t-office, as he had that moment, met cap|tain Barnard, in a very fine equipage. My heart &s;unk in me, at this news.&mdash;Yet I &s;till flattered my&s;elf, that lord N&mdash; might mi&s;take &s;ome other per&s;on for him, and was earne&s;t in per&s;uad|ing his lord&s;hip, that he was deceived, when the captain's &s;ervant brought me the following card.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"IF lady Harriet H&mdash; will be at home, and alone this evening, captain Barnard will, if agreeable, do him&s;elf the honour of wait|ing on her, at &s;ix o'clock."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="62">THE &s;urprize I had been in before was aug|mented by this extraordinary me&s;&s;age. I, how|ever, &s;ent word I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee him; and pa&s;&s;ed the intermediate hours in endeavouring to prepare my&s;elf for that fatal change, which was already but too vi&s;ible, but which I was utterly unable to account for.</P>
<P>AT the appointed time, he came, and endea|voured to a&s;&s;ume a &s;ort of formal tenderne&s;s, ac|companied with an air of gravity, and my&s;tery. I could not long endure &s;uch a cruel &s;tate of &s;u&s;|pen&s;e, and pre&s;&s;ed to know what it was that affected him? he told me, he was the mo&s;t mi&s;e|rable man breathing, that all his &s;chmes of hap|pine&s;s were bla&s;ted, but that he never could have re&s;olution to tell me, how they were &s;o&mdash;called me, dear, &s;uffering angel! ki&s;&s;ed my hand and wept.&mdash;</P>
<P>I CANNOT de&s;cribe the emotion of my heart; I longed, yet feared, to know what all this meant; and, at length, told him, that if he did not wi&s;h to make me extremely unhappy, he would explain this enigma. He &s;aid, he had great rea&s;on to fear, that &s;atisfying my inquiries, would render me yet more wretched, even than doubt could do; and if the &s;ecret could be kept for ever from me, he would die rather than reveal it. But I mu&s;t know it, and he who was a &s;harer in the misfortune, would tell it with mo&s;t tender|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>HE then conjured me, to &s;ummon all the love I ever had for him, that it might incline me to pity, and pardon a wretch, that had undone him|&s;elf! in &s;hort he told me, that his friends had prevailed on him to marry Mi&s;s S&mdash;, whom he unfortunately met at Aix la Chapelle, and accompanied to London&mdash;that at the moment he received her hand, the icy one of death would
<PB N="63" REF="63">
have been more welcome; that his heart did, and ever &s;hould adore me, and only me.</P>
<P>HE had knelt by my &s;ide, while he told this fatal &s;tory, and when he fini&s;hed it, wept ex|tremely. To his amazement, not one &s;igh or tear e&s;caped me. I ro&s;e immediately, and wi&s;hed him joy, then rung the bell to order my chariot; he remained immoveable, I begged he would ri&s;e, before the &s;ervant entered&mdash;he obeyed; but im|plored me not to leave him; &s;aid it was impo&s;&s;i|ble that I could really be &s;o indifferent as I ap|peared; that he was prepared to meet my anger, or my &s;orrow, but could not bear contempt.</P>
<P>I TOLD him, that was at pre&s;ent my predo|minant &s;entiment, and the &s;ooner he retired from it, and put an end to this interview, the better, and which I would take care &s;hould be our la&s;t. He vowed he would never leave the &s;pot, where he again pro&s;trated him&s;elf, till I pronounced his pardon. I told him this was adding in&s;ult to in|jury, but &s;ince he would not quit my apartment, I &s;hould.</P>
<P>I THREW my&s;elf into my carriage, and &s;uf|fered my&s;elf to be carried to the marchione&s;s de St. Aumont's&mdash;there I met lord Woodville, and lord N&mdash;; who both remarked that I looked extremely ill, and advi&s;ed me to leave the a&s;&s;em|bly, and return home. And I &s;oon found my&s;elf really &s;o, that I was obliged to follow their ad|vice.</P>
<P>I WENT immediately to bed, without &s;peak|ing a &s;yllable, even to my maid, who ob&s;erving &s;o &s;udden a change in my manners and appear|ance, &s;at up in my dre&s;&s;ing-room. The heroi&s;m of my conduct towards captain Barnard, had flattered my pride, and kept up my &s;pirits, while he was pre&s;ent: but I was no &s;ooner alone, than I felt all the weight of my misfortunes; and the
<PB N="64" REF="64">
agitation and di&s;traction of my mind threw me into convul&s;ions. My maid had immediate help for me, but all the art of the be&s;t phy&s;icians in Paris, could not re&s;tore my &s;en&s;es for fifteen days&mdash;happy interval! delightful rece&s;s from ago|nizing &s;orrow.</P>
<P>AT length, their cruel kindne&s;s triumphed &s;o far, as to re&s;tore my rea&s;on&mdash;but, good God, in what a &s;hattered plight did it return! and to what a poor, defaced, and wretched habitation? my di&s;order was generally believed to be a malignant fever, but doctor L&mdash;, who under&s;tood the maladies of the mind, as well as body, and was acquainted with my attachment to captain Bar|nard, contributed to the recovery of the latter, by admini&s;tering con&s;olation to the former, much more, than all the art of medicine could have done. I &s;oon di&s;charged all my phy&s;icians, but him, who only knew the &s;ource of my complaint; and to his &s;kill and tenderne&s;s am I indebted, for the pre&s;ervation of this wretched being.</P>
<P>DURING my illne&s;s, lord Woodville, and lord N&mdash;, behaved like brothers to me&mdash;they both vi&s;ited me daily, and endeavoured, but in vain, and unknowing of the cau&s;e, to di&s;&s;ipate that melancholy, which will for ever prey upon my heart. My mind was &s;o much weakened, that I determined to go into a convent, and flat|tered my&s;elf, that in that calm retirement, I &s;hould find peace and re&s;t. I fancied I might there retain the tenets of my own religion, only conforming externally to theirs.</P>
<P>I COMMUNICATED my project to doctor L&mdash;, who &s;oon convinced me, that peace dwells not in a cloi&s;ter, but that even tho&s;e holy retreats are filled with vain wi&s;hes, and tumultuous pa&s;|&s;ions; and that it would be making a mockery
<PB N="65" REF="65">
of all religion, to pretend to embrace theirs, un|le&s;s I could do it &s;incerely.</P>
<P>WHILE I remained in a very weak and lan|gui&s;hing condition, a gentleman called frequently to enquire my health; but as he refu&s;ed to leave his name, I gue&s;&s;ed it was &s;ome per&s;on &s;ent by captain Barnard, and was therefore not the lea&s;t inqui&s;itive about him. At length he de&s;ired to be admitted to &s;ee me, &s;aying, he had &s;omething of importance to communicate.</P>
<P>I CONSENTED; and after the common civi|lities were over, he took a pacquet out of his pocket, and pre&s;enting it to me, &s;aid, he hoped that would be an acceptable pre&s;ent. It was di|rected in an unknown hand; but as I he&s;itated about receiving it, he &s;aid I had nothing to fear from the contents, and he would call for my an|&s;wer the next day; and in&s;tantly left the room.</P>
<P>THE Pacquet contained a long letter from captain Barnard, filled with vain excu&s;es for his fal&s;ehood, and pa&s;&s;ionate intreaties that I would again &s;uffer him to plead his pardon at my feet&mdash;he expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t poignant &s;orrow for my illne&s;s, and begged I would at lea&s;t permit him to repair the injuries he had done me, as far as it was po&s;&s;ible, by accepting an unlimited power over that fortune, to which he had &s;acrificed his love, honour, and happine&s;s; and as a proof of my forgivene&s;s, reque&s;ted I would receive an en|clo&s;ed bill for five hundred pounds; but if my pride &s;hould &s;till reject his penitence, he de&s;ired I would return his letters, by the gentleman that was the bearer of that.</P>
<P>THIS fre&s;h in&s;ult rou&s;ed all my re&s;entment again&s;t him, and I pa&s;&s;ed a re&s;tle&s;s night, count|ing the clock, and with impatience waiting for the hour when I &s;hould re&s;tore his in&s;olent pre|&s;ent, with the &s;corn it merited.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="66">AT length, his amba&s;&s;ador arrived, and ei|ther was, or &s;eemed to be &s;urprized, when I ac|quainted him with the purport of the letter he had brought me; and made many apologies for hav|ing unwittingly offended&mdash;&s;aid the affair between captain Barnard and me had been repre&s;ented in a very different light to him: that he under&s;tood there had been a &s;light quarrel between us, and that the letter he brought, was to be the means of a reconcilement.</P>
<P>CRUEL Barnard, mercile&s;s man! was it not enough to make me wretched! why &s;hould he endeavour to make me infamous al&s;o! I return|ed the note, and put the letter which had enclo&s;ed it, into the fire. As to tho&s;e I had formerly re|ceived from captain Barnard, I told his friend I would readily part with them, when he &s;hould have re&s;tored mine; but as I had no rea&s;on to have the lea&s;t reliance on his word, I would not give them out of my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, on any other terms. He applauded my re&s;olution and re|tired.</P>
<P>I LONGED impatiently to leave Paris, and fancied I &s;hould recover my peace, by quitting the &s;cene of my unhappine&s;s.&mdash;I was obliged to part with &s;ome of the jewels, which Mrs. Bol|ton had left me, to defray the expences of my illne&s;s and journey; and in a &s;tate of the lowe&s;t weakne&s;s both of mind and body, I returned to London.</P>
<P>ON my arrival, I found that a maiden aunt of my father's, who had never taken the lea&s;t notice of me, during her life, had bequeathed me her whole fortune, ten thou&s;and pounds; merely be|cau&s;e I was her name&s;ake, and unprovided for by my father. This was a very happy addition to my confined circum&s;tances; but I was incapable of joy, and continued to live like a reclu&s;e, till
<PB N="67" REF="67">
lord Woodville's return to England.&mdash;He &s;oon found me out, and did me the honour to pre&s;ent me to lady Straffon, and his lovely Emily.</P>
<P>IN this charming &s;ociety, I began to recover my tranquility, and flattered my&s;elf that it was well nigh e&s;tabli&s;hed, till the unlucky accident, which brought captain Barnard to my &s;ight, con|vinced me, that there is no cure for ill-fated love; &s;ince neither the cruelty I have experien|ced, nor time it&s;elf, have yet been able to con|quer it.</P>
<P>I WILL not now, my dear lady Woodville, take up more of your time, by apologizing for the weakne&s;s of my conduct through this unhap|py affair; for

<P>I HAVE a thou&s;and thanks to give my dear Emily, for the plea&s;ing though melancholy entertainment, which lady Harriet's hi&s;tory has afforded me.&mdash;When I was very young, I u&s;ed to be &s;urprized that &s;o many tragedies and novels were founded on the perfidy of men: but I have for &s;ome years pa&s;t, been perfectly convinced, that mo&s;t of the mi&s;eries in this life, owe their being to that fatal &s;ource. And were there but a window in every fair bo&s;om in the cities of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter, we &s;hould di&s;cover numberle&s;s hidden traces of the barbarous tri|umphs, of tho&s;e doughty
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Heroes, famous and
<PB N="68" REF="68">
renowned for wronging innocence, and break|ing vows:"</Q>
and among this dete&s;table corps, I think captain Barnard might lead the van, and Sir James Miller bring up the rear.</P>
<P>YOU may &s;ee, by this di&s;po&s;ition, that I think wor&s;e of the captain than the baronet, as I think lady Harriet much more unhappy than Lucy. However, I &s;incerely hope they may both &s;ur|mount their afflictions: for time and rea&s;on can do more, in the&s;e ca&s;es, than the &s;ufferers are willing to allow. They are patients that do not wi&s;h to be cured; and find a degree of plea&s;ure in indulging their malady.</P>
<P>I AM of opinion, that when di&s;appointed love &s;ub&s;ides into a calm and gentle melancholy, its &s;en&s;ations may not only be plea&s;ing to the per&s;ons that feel it, but render them more amiable than they would otherwi&s;e be, by giving a peculiar &s;oftne&s;s, both to their form and manners. I think I &s;hould be more apt to fall in love with a per&s;on &s;o circum&s;tanced, than with one who had never felt <HI>la belle pa&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE great plea&s;ure in telling you, that Lu|cy daily gains &s;trength, both of mind and body; and I by no means de&s;pair of a perfect cure. The mo&s;t favourable &s;ymptom is, her not having mentioned Sir James the&s;e two days; yet have I not once re&s;trained her on the &s;ubject, as &s;he has lately &s;poke of him with great calmne&s;s. I have not yet &s;hewn her lady Harriet's memoir.&mdash;Ten|derne&s;s like &s;orrow is contagious; and the &s;imili|tude of their &s;ituations, might call forth tears, which, though &s;et down to the account of friend&s;hip, would certainly flow from her own &s;ympathy.</P>
<P>IT is utterly impo&s;&s;ible for me to have the plea|&s;ure of vi&s;iting Woodfort this &s;ummer.&mdash;I expect Sir John in a very few days.&mdash;As &s;oon as he ar|rives,
<PB N="69" REF="69">
we &s;hall go into E&s;&s;ex.&mdash;I do not think Lucy &s;ufficiently recovered to quit her nur&s;e, as &s;he calls me.&mdash;My little Emily and Edward are quite well, and &s;urprizingly grown &s;ince their ill|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>I LONG to know what became of captain Bar|nard, the day he left you; and, what connexion he coud have with lady Ransford; who, from your account, &s;eems not to be one of tho&s;e, who were born to weep over the willow.</P>
<P>I SUPPOSE you will &s;oon &s;et out for York.&mdash;The lovely marchione&s;s is to be there.&mdash;Is lady Law&s;on to be of your party? I could wi&s;h &s;he were; as I fear my dear Emily may not be &s;uffi|ciently attentive to her pre&s;ent &s;ituation.&mdash;Let me entreat you not to ride, and to dance but little. My true love attends your lord; and, with good wi&s;hes to all your party, I am, affectionately,</P>

<P>I AM not half &s;atisfied with my dear Fanny's <HI>no comment</HI> on lady Harriet's affecting &s;tory.&mdash;By making the ca&s;e general, you &s;eem inclined to le&s;&s;en the calamity.&mdash;But a plague is a plague, though ten thou&s;and, or only one thou&s;and, die of it; and, by extending its dominion, you en|crea&s;e the fatality, without abating our compa&s;|&s;ion for particular &s;ufferers.</P>

<PB N="70" REF="70">
would &s;oon have been complete; for I really think the fir&s;t wound mu&s;t have &s;ubdued it. But he, who has penetration enough to &s;ee the &s;oftne&s;s of my nature, has al&s;o genero&s;ity &s;ufficient to pre|vent my very wi&s;hes; and &s;eems to have no fear, but want of power to gratify them.

<P>I FIND lord Seymour va&s;tly aver&s;e to our go|ing to York.&mdash;He has taken &s;o much pains to di&s;&s;uade me from it, that if I had not promi&s;ed Fanny We&s;ton, and Sir James Thornton, who&s;e hearts are &s;et on going, I &s;hould find great plea|&s;ure in &s;acrificing my own inclination to his lord|&s;hip.&mdash;Yet he gives no &s;olid rea&s;on, for our declining his party.&mdash;I perceive that <HI>my</HI> lord looks grave, when the &s;ubject is mentioned; of cour&s;e, it is immediately dropped; and I find the boys and girls will be conquerors.&mdash;Even the grave lady Harriet, and Mr. Ransford, &s;eem|ed to be alarmed while the matter appeared doubtful.</P>
<P>I THINK I have as little curio&s;ity, as any of my &s;ex, yet I confe&s;s my&s;elf anxious to know lord Seymour's motive.&mdash;He is a man of &s;uch excellent under&s;tanding, and true politene&s;s, that I am a&s;toni&s;hed at his thinking differently, even upon this trifling &s;ubject, from <HI>my lord!</HI> But avaunt! thou fir&s;t female vice, curio&s;ity! I will not &s;uffer thee to harbour one moment longer in my brea&s;t, thou inho&s;pitable tenant! di&s;turber of the peaceful man&s;ion that receives thee!</P>
<P>LADY Law&s;on will not accompany us to York: &s;he has been confined to her chamber for &s;ome days, with a fever on her &s;pirits. A young lady whom &s;he took into her hou&s;e, a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed orphan, five years ago, and treated with
<PB N="71" REF="71">
the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s, has ju&s;t left her. This is unlucky, as &s;he is ill, and alone. Sir William &s;et out for London ye&s;terday, without calling upon us.</P>
<P>THE moment I have quitted one dear &s;i&s;ter, I &s;hall fly to the other, and &s;pend as much time as I po&s;&s;ibly can with her. Should &s;he continue ill, it will prevent my going to York. I &s;hall be only &s;orry for the occa&s;ion, for I have lo&s;t all re|li&s;h for the party.</P>
<P>I KNOW not what became of captain Barnard, the day he left us; but I hear he is a con&s;tant vi&s;itor at Ransford-hall.&mdash;The old knight is laid up in the gout; and her lady&s;hip acts in the double capacity of ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s of the family.</P>
<P>I HOPE Sir John is by this time, returned to you full of love, and joy and admiration, at your amazing prowe&s;s, with regard to his children; and that you are all as happy as you de&s;erve, and I</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I have been u&s;ed from my infancy, to your tender participation of all my pains, and plea&s;ures, I could not re&s;i&s;t my inclination of &s;ending you the inclo&s;ed, which afforded me the mo&s;t charming <HI>melange</HI> of both, that I have ever met with. I am proud, and plea&s;ed, that the writer was a woman; but cannot help lamenting that &s;uch noble &s;entiments, &s;uch an elegant turn of mind, and above all, &s;uch tender &s;en&s;ibility, &s;hould be buried in a cloi&s;ter.</P>
<P>NOW for the means by which I obtained this trea&s;ure.&mdash;Ye&s;terday evening, after tea, the conver&s;ation turned on the &s;ubject of letter-writing. Lord Seymour advanced, and was &s;e|conded by <HI>my lord,</HI> that ladies in general, wrote better in the epi&s;tolary &s;tile than men.&mdash;As I looked upon &s;uch a declaration, rather as a com|pliment paid to the pre&s;ent company, than their real &s;entiments, I took up the argument: and though they mentioned &s;everal in&s;tances of charming female &s;cribes, all of whom I admire, as much as they, yet would I not allow the me|rit general:&mdash;for tho&s;e very per&s;ons, whom they quoted, are or ought to be, as much di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t of their &s;ex, for their &s;uperior ta|lents, as lady C&mdash;, or the dutche&s;s of H&mdash;, for their uncommon beauty.</P>
<P>LORD Seymour politely called me an heretic, again&s;t &s;elf conviction; &s;aid he had ob&s;erved my frequent u&s;e of the pen, and was per&s;uaded that no per&s;on, with half my under&s;tanding, was
<PB N="73" REF="73">
ever fond of writing, who was not con&s;cious of writing well. I told his lord&s;hip if the conver|&s;ation became particular, there mu&s;t be an end of the general argument. He bowed, and went on with repeating &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages from female let|ters, which did honour to his ta&s;te, and with which we were all charmed.</P>
<P>HE then told us, that he had a letter in his pocket, which he looked upon to be the <HI>chef d'aeuvre</HI> of female eloquence; that he had found it as he was one morning taking a &s;olitary walk in the Tuilleries; that he would permit me to read it, provided I would candidly give him my opi|nion, whether I thought any man living could dictate &s;uch a letter. On my promi&s;ing to be &s;in|cere, he took it out of his pocket-book, pre|&s;ented it to me, with a trembling hand, and left the room.</P>
<P>WHEN we met at &s;upper, I was lavi&s;h in its prai&s;e, and declared, that I doubted whether even Rou&s;&s;eau could have wrote more tenderly. He &s;eemed delighted at my conver&s;ation, and im|mediately complied with my reque&s;t, to &s;uffer me to take a copy of it, for you, and you only.</P>
<P>I IMPATIENTLY long to know &s;omething more of the lady's hi&s;tory.&mdash;I cannot be per|&s;uaded that it was mere accident which put it into lord Seymour's hands.&mdash;But I will not de|tain you from the peru&s;al of it by my vague conjectures&mdash;I &s;hall, however, &s;atisfy your curio&s;ity in a more material point, by letting you know lady Law&s;on is better.&mdash;I am to dine with her, t&ecirc;te-&aacute;-t&ecirc;te, to-morrow.</P>
<P>I SHALL claim great merit for this volunteer. I hope Lucy continues well. I earne&s;tly wi&s;h to know what apology you have made for that worthle&s;s idiot, Sir James Miller to Sir John.

<HEAD>THE LETTER.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<P>AFTER a conflict of four months, the milde&s;t moment of which &s;ad time, was in|finitely more painful, than that which &s;hall &s;eparate this feeble frame from its perturbed &s;pirit, I &s;it down to bid an everla&s;ting adieu to him, who was far dearer than the fir&s;t, and long maintained the &s;cale in equal balance with the latter. Did I &s;ay <HI>was?</HI> alas! he is, and ever will be, dearer than my life! which I would &s;acrifice, a thou&s;and times, rather than wound his heart, as I now mu&s;t.</P>
<P>UNHAPPY Henry! what pangs, what an|gui&s;h will now rend thy bo&s;om, when thou &s;halt be convinced, thou never had&s;t a rival in thy Charlotte's love! Even heaven it&s;elf yielded its claim to thee; and my fond heart adored the Maker in his mo&s;t perfect work, thy charming &s;elf! Such, in thy Charlotte's eyes, did&s;t thou appear, till thy relentle&s;s jea|lou&s;y pur&s;ued, and would have robbed of life&mdash;no rival, Henry! but thy Charlotte's bro|ther!</P>
<P>HOW will amazement &s;trike thee! My &s;ad heart bleeds for thine. Involved in my&s;tery, and my&s;ery from my birth, this truth could not have reached you &s;ooner; nor could I po&s;&s;ibly reveal the &s;ecret, and brand with cruelty and guilt, the authors of my wretched being.</P>
<P>RECALL the fatal evening to your mind when that accur&s;ed jealou&s;y infu&s;ed its venom fir&s;t into your bo&s;om&mdash;what pains did I not
<PB N="75" REF="75">
take to counteract the poi&s;on! how was the innocent young man a&s;toni&s;hed at your beha|viour! remember the la&s;t words I ever uttered to you.&mdash;<HI>My deare&s;t Henry, let not appear|ances di&s;turb your mind, I can, and will, account for every action of my life to you&mdash;let your &s;ervant attend at the grate, to-morrow, for a letter from me, and you &s;hall be fully &s;atisfied.</HI></P>
<P>AH! Henry, how could you doubt her truth, who never yet deceived you! by what you now mu&s;t feel, judge what I felt, when word was brought me, you had killed my brother! that he &s;urvives, for your &s;ake, and my own, I bow my heart to heaven. Ah! what uncommon mi&s;ery were mine, were I compelled to hate you! No, Henry I am not &s;o wtetched; I may love you &s;till, with|out a crime; mo&s;t truly love you; and every prayer that I addre&s;s to Heaven, may wa&s;t petitions for your true felicity!</P>
<P>TO-MORROW, I renounce the world; vain ceremony! Alas! I have renounced my Henry, before.&mdash;This is my la&s;t adieu.&mdash;May every &s;aint and angel, ble&s;s, protect and guide you, to that heaven, where we may, once more, hope to meet!&mdash;Till then, farewell, for ever.&mdash;</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>Lady</HI> STRAFFON, <HI>to Lady</HI> WOODVILLE.</HEAD>
<P>I AM va&s;tly obliged to my dear Emily, for her two la&s;t letters&mdash;her volunteer was delightful&mdash;that angelic nun has almo&s;t broke my heart&mdash;it is impo&s;&s;ible &s;he can be happy in a cloi&s;ter,
<PB N="76" REF="76">
and I very much doubt, whether tho&s;e fine feel|ings, which &s;he &s;eems to have, would not have rendered her rather more mi&s;erable, had &s;he re|mained in the world. May &s;he &s;oon arrive at that place, where the highe&s;t &s;en&s;ibility mu&s;t be productive of the highe&s;t happine&s;s!</P>
<P>YOU will, perhaps, think me cruel, for wi&s;h|ing her death; but indeed, my dear &s;i&s;ter, there is &s;carce a man living, who could de&s;erve &s;uch a heart as hers; not even lord Seymour, to whom I believe it devoted. If I read aright, I am trully &s;orry for his misfortune; he has &s;u&s;tained an ir|reparable lo&s;s.</P>
<P>I DARE &s;ay your lord is acquainted with the whole &s;tory; and as I am per&s;uaded that lord Seymour is incapable of a ba&s;e, or mean action, he may, perhaps, be prevailed on, to &s;atisfy your curio&s;ity&mdash;but if he once declines it, pre&s;s him no farther. As you value his peace, and your own, never lay him under the painful ne|ce&s;&s;ity of refu&s;ing any thing to the woman he loves; nor let him ever &s;ee you have a wi&s;h un|gratified. Believe me, Emily, more women lo&s;e their hu&s;bands hearts, by what they call car|rying their point, and teizing a good natured man into compliance, than any other way.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t part of this letter, like the Gazette, has been devoted to foreign affairs; now for do|me&s;tic.&mdash;Sir John returned la&s;t week in perfect health and &s;pirits, from Paris. I did not &s;uffer the children to appear, till I acquainted him with my bold undertaking&mdash;at fir&s;t he looked &s;ur|prized and terrified; but immediately recollect|ing him&s;elf, &s;aid, that from his Fanny's counte|nance, he was certain our joint trea&s;ure mu&s;t be &s;afe. At that in&s;tant, the little animals flew into his arms; I cannot de&s;cribe the charming &s;cene,
<PB N="77" REF="77">
but it was, as you &s;ay, all
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"love, and joy, and admiration."</Q></P>
<P>LUCY came next; &s;he had &s;ummoned all her &s;pirits, to meet her brother, but in &s;pite of all her re&s;olution, a wayward tear &s;tole down her lovely cheek. To our mutual &s;urprize Sir John took not the lea&s;t notice of her &s;oft confu&s;ion, nor a&s;ked a &s;ingle que&s;tion about Sir James Mil|ler. Lucy was va&s;tly happy at his &s;eeming inat|tention; but it alarmed me much more, than if he had &s;poken upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>A LITTLE time after, he withdrew into his clo|&s;et, and wrote at letter&mdash;his &s;ervant returned as we were &s;itting down to dinner, and told him the gentleman was not at home. During our meal, I felt the utmo&s;t anxiety, but dur&s;t not &s;peak. Lucy was the exact re&s;emblance of Shake&s;pear's patience on a monument, <Q REND="inline">"&s;miling at grief."</Q> Sir John appeared to be perfectly at ea&s;e, chearful and lively.</P>
<P>I OBSERVED to him, that he talked much, and eat little. He pre&s;&s;ed my hand with unaf|fected tenderne&s;s, and &s;aid the joy he felt at &s;ee|ing us all, had quite ab&s;orded any thought of him&s;elf, but that nature would &s;oon return to its old bent, and bid me beware of my beef and mutton to-morrow.</P>
<P>I KNEW the lo&s;s of appetite to be a common effect of joy, and therefore endeavoured to per|&s;uade my&s;elf, that all was well. When we aro&s;e from table, he &s;aid he had &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s to tran|&s;act for a gentleman in Paris, but that he &s;houd return to tea, and de&s;ired Lucy to have her voice and harp&s;ichord, in tune, to &s;ing him &s;ome new &s;ongs; he then put on his &s;word and walked bri&s;kly out of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>LUCY and I remained for &s;ome moments pe|trified; we could neither &s;peak, nor lok at each
<PB N="78" REF="78">
other&mdash;at length &s;he aro&s;e, and with a &s;low peace, and down-ca&s;t looks advanced to where I &s;at, then fell upon her knees before me, and bathed my hand with her fa&s;t-falling tears. I could not bid her ri&s;e, but &s;unk down by her, and joined in fervent prayer, for my hu&s;band, and her brother's &s;afety.</P>
<P>A THOUSAND times the dear unhappy girl implored my pardon, as though &s;he were the guilty cau&s;e, of what I did, or might hereafter &s;uffer. Her angui&s;h &s;eemed unutterable; and alarmed and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed as I then was, I found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to conceal my own fears, and &s;peak peace to her di&s;tracted tortured mind.</P>
<P>IN le&s;s than an hour, Sir John relieved us from this &s;hocking &s;tate&mdash;at the tran&s;porting &s;ound of his voice, we endeavoured to compo&s;e our&s;elves&mdash;Lucy flew to open the door of the parlour, where we had remained during his ab|&s;ence; &s;he ru&s;hed into his arms, and fainted there. The &s;trong tran&s;ition overpowered her every fa|culty, and it was a con&s;iderable time before &s;he &s;hewed any &s;igns of life. I do not blu&s;h to tell you that Sir John wept over his beloved &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as &s;he had power of articulation, &s;he gazed intently on her brother, and exclaimed, Where is the unhappy man? and do I &s;ee my deare&s;t brother &s;afe, and un&s;tained with blood?</P>
<P>MY dear Lucy, Sir John replied, calm your &s;pirits&mdash;you need have no apprehen&s;ions, ei|ther for Sir James Miller or for me&mdash;he is fallen below my re&s;entment; and you might have been a&s;&s;ured from the fir&s;t, that any man who dared to treat a woman ill, mu&s;t be a coward in his heart.</P>
<P>BUT did you meet? cried Lucy. No, &s;aid Sir John, and I will an&s;wer for it, we never &s;hall,
<PB N="79" REF="79">
if he can avoid it; and I promi&s;e you, I &s;hall not &s;eek the wretch.</P>
<P>BUT pray, Sir John, &s;aid I, how came you acquainted with his ungenerous behaviour? As vice and folly are generally connected, replied Sir John, he was weak enough to inform again&s;t him&s;elf by a letter which he wrote to me at Paris, &s;ome time after his marriage; and concluded it with pre&s;enting lady Miller's compliments, and hoping that notwith&s;tanding what had pa&s;&s;ed, we might &s;till be friends, and live upon good terms</P>
<P>IN my an&s;wer, I told him that though &s;ighting had formerly been my profe&s;&s;ion, I was neither a bully nor a bravo, and if he could acquit him&s;elf with honour, of a breach of faith to a woman of unque&s;tioned merit, I was ready to accord him the friend&s;hip he de&s;ired; but as I looked upon that to be impo&s;&s;ible, I hoped he would at lea&s;t be ready to afford me the only &s;atisfaction that remained in his power to offer or mine to receive. That I &s;hould leave Paris in a few days, and call upon him, as &s;oon as I arrived in London.</P>
<P>I SAW his &s;ervant near this hou&s;e, when I a|lighted, and I have rea&s;on to think he was placed there, to watch my coming; as Sir James and his lady &s;et out in a few minutes after for Paris. And I think there now ramains nothing, but to wi&s;h my dear Lucy joy of her e&s;cape, from &s;uch a contemptible animal.</P>
<P>I AM, indeed, my dear brother, &s;aid Lucy, truly joyful&mdash;what a wretch &s;hould I have been, if any misfortune had befallen you, on my account? how could I ever have looked upon my more than &s;i&s;ter, or her little ang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> babes? Sir John and I endeavoured to change the &s;ub|ject, but Lucy frequently recurred to it.</P>
<P>AH, Emily! her wounds are not yet healed.
<PB N="80" REF="80">
We &s;pent the evening in a kind of plea&s;ing me|lancholy&mdash;though our hearts were at peace, our &s;pirits were too much agitated to be chearful. I propo&s;ed our &s;etting out for Straffon Hill, next day, but Sir John &s;eemed inclined to &s;tay for a few days longer. As I have now no apprehen|&s;ions from Sir James Miller, I can have no ob|jection, though I confe&s;s I long for pure air, and peace; two charming things, which are never to be found in a great city.</P>
<P>I CONGRATULATE you on lady Law&s;on's recovery. How does poor lady Harriet? Have you civilized Sir James Thornton? I mean, has he yet fallen in love? What is Fanny We&s;ton doing?

<P>YOU very aptly compare your la&s;t letter to a news-paper, which records facts indi&s;crimi|nately&mdash;how could you po&s;&s;ibly think of
<PB N="81" REF="81">
the charming nun, however engaging or affecting her &s;ituation, and thence proceed to a &s;ober lec|ture on matrimony, before you mentioned events &s;o intere&s;ting, as tho&s;e which related to Sir John, Lucy, and your&s;elf? you are certainly a perfect &s;toic, and I begin to fear you will &s;oon be above <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"life's weakne&s;s, and its comforts too."</Q> You &s;ee how gladly I lay hold of the fir&s;t opportunity I ever had, to critici&s;e on you.

<P>BUT to be &s;erious, both my lord and I are charmed with Sir John&mdash;his tenderne&s;s for his amiable &s;i&s;ter &s;ets his bravery in the &s;tronge&s;t light&mdash;and you really did not blu&s;h to record it! my dear Fanny mu&s;t have a great deal of effion|tery, notwith&s;tanding her mode&s;t countenance, and her meek air. I am in &s;uch high &s;pirits, at the happy conclu&s;ion of this di&s;agreeable affair, that I cannot command my pen to write one ra|tional line.</P>
<P>YES, it &s;hall tell you, that all this family con|gratulate our dear Lucy, and you, but more particularly her, on her lucky e&s;cape from that contemptible wretch Sir James Miller; and though we all hope, and believe our&s;elves to be very good chri&s;tians, there is not one of us would la|ment his untimely end, if he &s;hould be detected in picking pockets in Paris, and make his exit at the <HI>Greve.</HI></P>
<P>AND &s;o my dear wi&s;e &s;i&s;ter very prudently warned me again&s;t teazing my lord&mdash;it was a pro|per caution, and I &s;hall u&s;e it&mdash;am not I very obedient? but &s;he left me at full liberty, to tor|ment
<PB N="82" REF="82">
any one el&s;e&mdash;I &s;hall u&s;e this latitude al&s;o. To begin:&mdash;I mu&s;t inform you, that I am in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hi&s;tory of our lovely nun, and unre&s;trained from communicating it to you; yet &s;hall I not gratify your curio&s;ity, which I am cer|tain is as great as mine, until you are brought to confe&s;s it; and provoked to &s;ay, P&s;ha, Emily, how can you be &s;o teizing?'</P>
<P>I MUST now ha&s;ten to your queries, as we are going to dine at lord Withers's, four miles off. I have prevailed on lady Law&s;on to be of the par|ty; Sir William is not returned from London yet I do believe Sir James Thornton is in love, though we cannot gue&s;s with whom. He is lately become thoughtful and re&s;erved; we rally him on his gravity, and tell him he is
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"proud, me|lancholy, and gentleman like:"</Q>
though he has lo&s;t his chearfulne&s;s, his good humour is invin|cible, and he &s;trives to laugh, whenever he thinks we wi&s;h he &s;hould.</P>
<P>I MUCH fear that Cupid has played at cro&s;s|bow, among&s;t our young folks, and dealt out left-handed arrows. I fear poor Fanny We&s;ton is a &s;tricken deer, and am apprehen&s;ive, that the hand which gave, will never heal the wound. She &s;its whole evenings alone in her chamber, li&s;tening to an Aeolian harp, and &s;ometimes looks as if &s;he had been in tears. She &s;ays &s;he will go to London, from York; but I fancy &s;he may as well return to Woodfort, as all our male inmates will have left us.</P>
<P>LORD Seymour talks of going to the hot wells, at Bri&s;tol, in a few days; and Sir James Thorn|ton goes from York, to his own &s;eat in the We&s;t. Lady Harriet continues pretty much the &s;ame, except when captain Barnard is mentioned; which happens too frequently, as he &s;till vi&s;its at lady Ransford's.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="83">ADIEU, dear Fanny, the coach is ready, and Sir James Thornton waiting in the anti-chamber of the dre&s;&s;ing-room, to hand me to it. I can|not help laughing at the idea of her grave face. A thou&s;and loves attend Sir John, Lucy, and the babes.</P>

<P>IT is a remark, much to the honour of human nature, that happine&s;s creates benevolence. I am, therefore plea&s;ed with the illu&s;trating it, by telling you, that the calm and rational delight I receive, from my pre&s;ent happy &s;ituation, has rendered my mind &s;o placid, and &s;erene, as to prevent my re&s;enting your lady&s;hip's &s;arca&s;tical comment on my la&s;t letter. <HI>Au contraire,</HI> I am plea&s;ed at your becoming a critic; as I think you want a little of that <HI>&s;elf given</HI> con&s;equence, which is &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary, to give us weight with others.</P>

And as I know my dear Emily's weak &s;pirits are too apt to be alarmed, I cho&s;e to proceed in continu|ation, in hopes, that by &s;eeming to treat the matter lightly, I might prevent her apprehen&s;ions: and this remarkable in&s;tance of my delicacy, has her
<PB N="84" REF="84">
pretty little lady&s;hip con&s;trued into a total want of feeling. But you love <HI>faire la guerre</HI>; and now, look to your&s;elf.</P>
<P>I NEVER pretended to be devoid of curio&s;ity; it is a pa&s;&s;ion inherent to our natures, and, pro|perly conducted, may be productive of every good.&mdash;It is the &s;ource of knowledge; and in my mind, the &s;tronge&s;t mark of di&s;tinction be|tween the rational and brute creation&mdash;It is our birth right, de&s;cended to us from our fir&s;t mo|ther.&mdash;You will, perhaps, &s;ay, it is an inheri|tance we might have di&s;pen&s;ed with, as it has certainly co&s;t us too dear; yet as I have already &s;aid, if well cultivated, it is a fruitful &s;oil; but, in the hands of the weak, or the idle, it can bring forth nothing but weeds, or thorns.</P>
<P>AGAINST this kind of produce, I warned my Emily, and &s;till warn her, le&s;t they, at any time, &s;hould wound her tender heart. I frankly con|fe&s;s my&s;elf intere&s;ted in the fate of your lovely nun; but in&s;tead of &s;aying, as you would have me, P&s;ha, Emily, how can you be &s;o teizing! I &s;hall &s;ay Pray, Emily, do not be teizing, but write me a full and true account of every cir|cum&s;tance you know, relating to the charming ve&s;tal; and of every thing el&s;e, that you think can afford any entertainment, to</P>

<P>WHAT a triumph for &s;uch a little in&s;igni|ficant animal as me, to be able to ruffle the calm dignity of a female philo&s;opher! I &s;hall begin to think my&s;elf of &s;ome con&s;equence; ra|ther of more weight, than <HI>the fly upon the chariot wheel.</HI> For, indeed my dear Fanny, notwith|&s;tanding your efforts to di&s;gui&s;e it, you were a little chagrined at the &s;mall attempt towards pertne&s;s, which I ventured to make, in my la&s;t letter; and, in truth, you wi&s;e ones, when once thrown off your guard, make as fooli&s;h a figure as any of us &s;impletons.</P>
<P>I HAVE heard it &s;aid, that a per&s;on who ne|ver learnt to fence, &s;hall be able to di&s;concert the greate&s;t ma&s;ter of that noble &s;cience; nay more, may po&s;&s;ibly kill him by a random pa&s;s, while he &s;tands in the be&s;t po&s;ture of defence, and is aim|ing at his antagoni&s;t, in all the profundity of quarte or tierce. Ju&s;t &s;uch a &s;crambling comba|tant have you to deal with, who, without the lea&s;t &s;kill in the art of logic, pre&s;umes to enter the li&s;ts with your wi&s;e lady&s;hip.</P>
<P>AND &s;o, Fanny, curio&s;ity is now become a virtue,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"productive of every good, the &s;ource of knowledge, the di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of rati|onality, an inheritance de&s;cended to us,"</Q>
&amp;c. And yet poor Emily is not to be allowed the u&s;e of this trea&s;ure, but to be deprived of her birth|right, and treated as an ab&s;olute alien to our grandmother Eve. Is not this a little hard?</P>
<P>BUT now what &s;ays <HI>my philo&s;ophy,</HI> to this &s;e|vere treatment? I think I &s;ee you laugh, at that expre&s;&s;ion. But pray, madam, is not the great

u&s;e and end of that exalted &s;tudy, to render us happy, by perfectly acquie&s;cing in our own lot, and wi&s;ely contemning all tho&s;e advantages that are denied us? Grant me but this, and I will immediately prove my&s;elf a philo&s;opher, by &s;hew|ing you how differently we think, in regard to this &s;ame trea&s;ure, called curio&s;ity, which I am not permitted to have any &s;hare of.</P>
<P>AND fir&s;t, I ab&s;olutely deny, that it ever was, or can be, productive of good. <HI>Au contraire,</HI> I have &s;cripture on my &s;ide, to prove that it was the original cau&s;e of every phy&s;ical, and moral ill, that has happened in this world, for I know not how many thou&s;and years. You &s;ay,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it is inherent to our natures."</Q>
Fie, Fanny! Could the Author of good then have puni&s;hed dame Eve, and all her de&s;cendants, merely for following the bent of that nature, he had him|&s;elf endued her with?&mdash;Impo&s;&s;ible!</P>
<P>I SAY, it was the devil, who fir&s;t introduced it into paradi&s;e, and infected poor Eve; for it certainly is contagious, and never to be eradica|ted. From her then it has de&s;cended to all her offspring, not as an inheritance though, but ra|ther as an uncancellable mortgage upon their natural patrimony.</P>
<P>YOU &s;ay, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it is the &s;ource of knowledge."</Q> There again, my dear, you are unluckily mi&s;ta|ken.&mdash;Pride is, undoubtedly, the fir&s;t motive; for not <HI>to be wi&s;e,</HI> but to be <HI>thought wi&s;er,</HI> than our neighbours, is the great reward. "A di&s;|tingui&s;hing mark of rationality. You are real|ly no philo&s;opher, lady Straffon.&mdash;Have you never &s;een a dog, or cat, rai&s;e up their ears, and li&s;ten with all the avidity with which an old maid hearkens to a &s;candalous report of &s;ome bloom|ing beauty of eighteen? Indeed, my dear, you mu&s;t have ob&s;erved this frequently; and I am

firmly per&s;uaded, that tho&s;e animals I have men|tioned, are ju&s;t as in&s;tinctively curious, as any dutche&s;s in Chri&s;tendom.</P>

<P>AND &s;o, my pretty little Bizarre, you are really delighted, at having ruffled a female philo&s;opher; and from thence are determined to derive &s;elf-con&s;equence: <HI>Helas, ma pauvre enfant!</HI> How grieved am I to mortify, by undeceiving you? for I cannot help informing you (though I know it to be cruel) that I have never been &s;o much plea&s;ed, with any of your letters, as your two la&s;t.</P>
<P>BROUGHT up, from your early infancy, with a high deference for my opinions, which for &s;ome years pa&s;t I have wi&s;hed you to &s;hake off, le&s;t it &s;hould prevent the free u&s;e of your own under&s;tanding, and occa&s;ion your receiving notions upon tru&s;t, without giving your&s;elf the trouble of examining them, I am delighted to

<P>SIR John has received a letter from Sir James Miller, wherein
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he intreats that Sir John will not bani&s;h him his native land, by keeping up any re&s;entment again&s;t him. He implores Lucy's pardon; and is mean enough to give hints, that his crime has been his puni&s;hment."</Q>
Poor abject wretch! Sir John has a&s;&s;ured him that he never can feel re&s;entment for a per&s;on he de&s;pi&s;es; &s;o that he may return to England in perfect &s;afety.</P>
<P>THIS la&s;t contemptible <HI>manoeuvre</HI> of Sir James, has I think completed Lucy's cure.

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM heartily glad that the mock war, as you call it, between us, is at an end, as I &s;hould at pre&s;ent, be totally unable to &s;upport my &s;hare in the combat, and of cour&s;e, mu&s;t fall before the conqueror. I have been unu&s;ually di&s;pirited, and languid, for the&s;e two days.&mdash;I feel, as if I had cau&s;e to be melancholy, and yet endeavour to per&s;uade my&s;elf that I have none. This is a &s;tate not to be de&s;cribed: and to you, who, I dare &s;ay, have never experienced it, may appear ridiculous; and yet, believe me, it is a painful &s;ituation&mdash;But I flatter my&s;elf, I have rather caught, than bred this malady.</P>
<P>LORD Seymour left us this morning; and for &s;ome days before he &s;et out, he &s;eemed to have acquired an additional degree of melancholy &s;oft|ne&s;s. Love he can never feel more.&mdash;Be&s;ides, <HI>my</HI> lord &s;eems infected with the &s;ame di&s;order; looks grave, and &s;ighs. Tell me then, Fanny, is it po&s;&s;ible that male friend&s;hip is &s;o much more delicate and tender than ours, that their mutual &s;adne&s;s could ari&s;e from a &s;eparation, for a few weeks, or perhaps months. If this &s;hould be the real cau&s;e, I &s;hall blu&s;h for my own want of &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="90">I SHOULD think lord Seymour in &s;uch a &s;tate of mind, that no &s;light or trivial misfortune could po&s;&s;ibly affect him; for they who have once felt real angui&s;h, may bid defiance to fu|ture ills. The arrows of adver&s;ity may glance again&s;t, but cannot wound a heart already bro|ken. From &s;ympathy alone, &s;uch minds can &s;uffer.&mdash;But, Oh! far, far, be the thought, from Emi|ly's fond bo&s;om, that lord Woodville's &s;ufferings &s;hould cau&s;e lord Seymour's &s;orrow! It is im|po&s;&s;ible! I am &s;orry I have expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch a thought, even to you, my &s;i&s;ter. I would blot it from the paper, if I could era&s;e it from my mind.</P>
<P>WE had, la&s;t night, a concert, in a temple dedicated to Apollo, in the garden.&mdash;My lord, who&s;e voice is harmony it&s;elf, was &s;inging one of Shen&s;tone's elegies. I accompanied him on the harp&s;ichord, and lord Seymour on the violoncello.&mdash;At the&s;e words,
<Q><L>" <HI>She was fair, and I could not but love,</HI></L>
<L>" <HI>She is faithle&s;s, and I am undone.</HI>"</L></Q>
I &s;aw lord Seymour fix his eyes on lord Wood|ville's face, which, in a moment, became &s;uf|fu&s;ed with crim&s;on; his voice faltered &s;o much, that he could &s;carce fini&s;h the &s;ong.</P>
<P>THE moment it was ended, he quitted the temple. I felt my&s;elf alarmed; I feared he was taken ill, and went immediately towards the hou&s;e. As I cro&s;&s;ed the parterre, I &s;aw him walking bri&s;kly, in a path that leads to the wood: this quieted my apprehen&s;ions for his health, but left my mind in a &s;tate incapable of thinking.&mdash;I retired to my chamber, and continued to mu&s;e, till &s;ummoned to &s;upper.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="91">THERE was no notice taken of what had pa&s;&s;ed&mdash;we parted earlier than u&s;ual, all but lord Seymour, and my lord, who continued together, till near four o'clock. I could not &s;leep, and wi&s;hed to have ri&s;en, and either walked, or read; but was unwilling to di&s;cover my re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s to him who cau&s;ed it. When we met, at break|fa&s;t, Mr. Ransford, who was ju&s;t arrived from London, a&s;ked my lord in a low voice, if I had been ill, as he ob&s;erved that I looked much paler than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>WHAT a flutter am I in! Ju&s;t as I had wrote the la&s;t word, my dear lord opened the door, and &s;aid he came to reque&s;t the plea&s;ure of my com|pany, to &s;ee a new improvement he is making; and, with the mo&s;t engaging affability, added, that he feared he had di&s;turbed my re&s;t, by &s;itting up &s;o late, but thought an airing would do us both good.</P>
<P>HIS behaviour has made all the foregoing part of my letter appear a vi&s;ion to me. Do not re|ply to it, my Fanny, till you hear from me again; and I hope, by next po&s;t, to have forgot I ever wrote it.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My deare&s;t FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE cloud that hung over my mind, is totally di&s;per&s;ed, and my happine&s;s re&s;tored with my rea&s;on. What a vi&s;ionary mu&s;t you think me! but do not chide me, my loved &s;i&s;ter, le&s;t, by endeavouring at a ju&s;tification, I &s;hould fancy I had found rea&s;on to &s;upport my folly.</P>
<P>I NEVER &s;pent &s;o delightful a day, as the la&s;t on which I wrote to you. During our airing, which was about &s;ix miles, my lord appeared, if po&s;&s;ible, more amiable to me than ever. There was a peculiar air of tenderne&s;s diffu&s;ed through his voice and manner; perhaps the parting from his friend, had &s;oftened his already gentle nature. Perhaps&mdash;but why pry into his bo&s;om, in &s;earch of a cau&s;e, which might render the effect le&s;s plea&s;ing?</P>
<P>IN le&s;s than an hour, we arrived at the neate&s;t and mo&s;t elegant cottage, I ever beheld. It was &s;eated on the declivity of a hill, and defended from the North winds by a &s;mall wood, &s;o beau|tifully variegated, that even in this leafy &s;ea&s;on, &s;ummer, autumn, and winter, &s;eemed to vye in the luxuriancy of the different &s;hades, which their &s;everal periods produce.</P>
<P>BEFORE the hou&s;e a pendant lawn, covered with &s;heep and lambs, reached to the river, which winded in the mo&s;t beautiful mazes round the hill. Over the broade&s;t part of it, was a Gothic bridge of one arch, with a watch tower in the center; and on the other &s;ide of the hou&s;e, &s;tood a &s;mall nur&s;ery and &s;hrubbery&mdash;I was never more
<PB N="93" REF="93">
agreeably &s;urprized, than with this lovely &s;cene. I really think if I was to meet with any &s;evere affliction, that I &s;hould like to retire to this de|lightful &s;olitude, and pa&s;s my days in it.</P>
<P>I FREQUENTLY &s;aw my lord's eyes &s;parkle with plea&s;ure, at that which I expre&s;&s;ed. As I neither &s;aw or heard a human creature but our|&s;elves, I begged to know who were the happy owners of this lovely &s;pot? &s;aid I wi&s;hed to &s;ee and congratulate them, on their ta&s;te and feli|city.&mdash;He &s;aid he would immediately comply with my reque&s;t, and by &s;o doing, increa&s;e the happine&s;s of its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>HE then led me to the hou&s;e, which was as &s;imply elegant within, as without&mdash;I think I ne|ver &s;aw perfect neatne&s;s before&mdash;and pre&s;ented me to his nur&s;e an extreme good looking woman, about fifty&mdash;&s;he knew not in what manner to receive me&mdash;humility and joy &s;eemed to &s;trug|gle in her countenance&mdash;I &s;tepped forward, and embraced her&mdash;my lord &s;eemed delighted at what he was plea&s;ed to call my conde&s;cen&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE good woman has been a widow for twelve years; her hu&s;band was fir&s;t gardener to my lord's father and her &s;on in-law is now in the &s;ame &s;tation with us. Her daughter is a very pretty woman about two and twenty; and ready to lye in of a &s;econd child. I never beheld &s;uch a che|rubim as the fir&s;t. My lord &s;aid archly, he hoped his fo&s;ter &s;i&s;ter and I &s;hould be better ac|quainted, and that &s;he would undertake the &s;ame good office for me, that her mother had done for his.</P>
<P>THE poor girl blu&s;hed, and curt&s;yed; I felt my cheeks glow: and walked to the window&mdash;I confe&s;s I was charmed with his intention to &s;uch a point, which the fooli&s;h lords of the creation generally think below them. He then inquired
<PB N="94" REF="94">
for the nur&s;e's mother, and the fine&s;t old woman I ever &s;aw, came into the room&mdash;I &s;aluted her al&s;o&mdash;her hair was perfectly &s;ilver, and her &s;kin like down&mdash;&s;he ble&s;&s;ed and embra&s;&s;ed my lord, while tears of joy and gratitude ran down her fair unfurrowed cheek.</P>
<P>MY lord was affected, and &s;aw me &s;ow; and in order to change the &s;ubject, told the good woman of the hou&s;e, he was come to dine with her.&mdash;She looked amazed, and &s;o &s;hould I, had I then thought him &s;erious&mdash;But I found he was &s;o, when he told her &s;he could certaily give us good bread, butter, ra&s;hers and eggs, and a &s;al|lad; and that he would take care of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>I SMILED a&s;&s;ent; but &s;aid we &s;hould &s;end home to prevent the company waiting. He &s;aid there was no nece&s;&s;ity for it, as he was quite &s;atisfied that our friends at Woodfort would &s;it down to dinner at the &s;ame in&s;tant that we did, without hearing from us. I then &s;uppo&s;ed he had left orders that they &s;hould not wait, and was plea&s;ed with the idea of our &s;imple ru&s;tic meal. But I was to be &s;till more &s;urprized; for in about ten minutes the coach arrived with lady Harriet, Fany We&s;ton, Sir James Thornton, and Mr. Ransford. A &s;umpter car followed with wine and cold provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>THE beauty of the &s;cene, the finene&s;s of the day, the unpremeditatedne&s;s of the &s;cheme, all con&s;pired to render us more chearful, than we &s;hould have been perhaps in any other place on earth; and we all returned home delighted with our little expedition, and full of gratitude to my lord, for the plea&s;ure it had afforded us.</P>
<P>THIS is an enormous long letter, but you taught me to ri&s;e early; I can therefore &s;pare time to my ab&s;ent friends, as well as tho&s;e about me; and I can never think that time better em|ployed,

<P>AS the chief circum&s;tances which relate to this lady, refer more to others than her&s;elf, we mu&s;t look back to the fir&s;t cau&s;es of tho&s;e effects, which &s;eem to have marked her fate. Unhappy in the very article of her birth, though de&s;cend|ed from a noble family, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to give &s;ome account of the authors of her being.</P>
<P>HER father the pre&s;ent general Beaumont, was the younge&s;t &s;on of one of the mo&s;t antient, and illu&s;trious hou&s;es in France: but as is gene|rally the ca&s;e with the &s;uperfluous branches of great families of that nation, he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no other patrimony than his high birth, a grace|ful per&s;on, and his &s;word.</P>
<P>THE church and the army are the only provi|&s;ions which &s;eem to be de&s;igned for the cadets of the noble&s;&s;e. To the latter our young &s;oldier of fortune applied him&s;elf, and &s;oon obtained a gen|teel po&s;t there. In this &s;ituation the then du|che&s;s dowager of H&mdash; &s;aw, and was captivated with our young hero.&mdash;Though her age more
<PB N="96" REF="96">
than doubled his, her per&s;on was &s;till plea&s;ing, and her fortune &s;o infinitely &s;uperior to his mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes, that he did not long he&s;itate to accept &s;uch a &s;plendid e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>THEY pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome years together, with that polite indifference, which di&s;tingui&s;hes the mar|ried couples of high rank, in that gay nation. At length, the duche&s;s began to grow weary, of treading the &s;ame dull circle, for &s;o many years, and propo&s;ed, to the general they &s;hould vi&s;it one of her e&s;tates in <HI>Languedoc,</HI> and pa&s;s a &s;ummer there. Though he was by no means tired of the <HI>grande monde,</HI> nor could po&s;&s;ibly form any very delightful idea of retirement, with &s;uch a compa|nion as her grace, he politely a&s;&s;ented to her re|que&s;t.</P>
<P>WHEN they had been &s;ome time in the coun|try, the duche&s;s hinted a de&s;ire of &s;ending for a young lady, who was a di&s;tant relation of her fir&s;t hu&s;band's, and whom &s;he had formerly placed in a convent. This propo&s;al was perfect|ly agreeable to the general. The mo&s;t de&s;irable <HI>tetes a tetes,</HI> &s;ometimes grow languid: but the interven&s;ion of a third per&s;on in &s;uch a &s;ituation as theirs, was mo&s;t devoutly to be wi&s;hed for.</P>
<P>HER grace &s;et out the next morning, for the convent de&mdash;, which was about five leagues from her &s;eat, and returned in the evening, ac|companied by the too lovely Charlotte D'Etree.&mdash;The general though well accu&s;tomed to the power of beauty, became &s;uddenly captivated.&mdash;Never had he beheld &s;uch a face and form before&mdash;&s;uch &s;imple elegance, &s;uch unaffected grace, the beauties of Venus, with Dian's mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>WHILE the lovely Charlotte felt at lea&s;t as much &s;urprize at the &s;ight of him. We have already &s;aid his per&s;on was remarkably graceful, his air at once engaging and commanding; nor
<PB N="97" REF="97">
was any outward ornament neglected, that could put off &s;uch a form to the be&s;t advantage.&mdash;What an amazing effect mu&s;t &s;uch a figure have upon a girl not yet &s;eventeen! who had been bred in a cloi&s;ter, and had never &s;een, or at lea&s;t conver&s;ed, with any man who did not wear a <HI>cowl.</HI></P>
<P>THE duche&s;s attempted to appologize for Charlotte's a&s;toni&s;hment. By ob&s;erving that the poor girl had been brought up in an ab&s;olute ignorance; but hoped when &s;he had been &s;ome time with her, that her aukward amazement would wear off. She might have talked for ever without interruption. The general had neither &s;peech nor hearing; his faculties &s;eemed all ab|&s;orbed in one; and through his eyes alone, his heart was for the fir&s;t time taught to feel a real pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE little wanton God, too much the gene|ral's friend, &s;oon in&s;pired the innocent and fair D'Etree, with the &s;ame &s;entiments. Never did the tyrant reign more ab&s;olute, than in the hearts of the&s;e his willing &s;laves. Whole months pa&s;&s;ing away in all the delights of mutual fond|ne&s;s, &s;eemed to the lovers but a day; and when at the end of autumn, the duche&s;s talked of re|turning to Paris, it appeared to them like being doomed to bani&s;hment.</P>
<P>CHARLOTTE was to accompany the duche&s;s thither; but the general knew their interviews mu&s;t be le&s;s frequent, and more liable to inter|ruption, than in the charming &s;olitude of <HI>belle veue.</HI> After every excu&s;e was obviated, and every po&s;&s;ible contrivance of delay exhau&s;ted they were forced to &s;ubmit; and the once gay and lively Charles Beaumont, &s;et out for the metropolis, with infinitely more regret than he had quitted it. The duche&s;s was happily not of
<PB N="98" REF="98">
a jealous nature; and the enamoured pair be|haved with &s;o much circum&s;pection, that &s;he never &s;eemed to have the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of their mutual attachment to the la&s;t hour of her life.</P>
<P>THE natural con&s;equences of their guilty love, now began to make Charlotte ta&s;te the bitter ingredients of that intoxicating cup, of which &s;he had drank &s;o deeply. Infamy &s;tared her in the face; and, though a criminal pa&s;&s;ion had triumphed over cha&s;tity, her mode&s;ty was not yet extingui&s;hed. Sleeple&s;s nights, and days of an|gui&s;h, now became her portion. She dete&s;ted her&s;elf and all the world; all, but the guilty au|thor of her mi&s;ery. How often did &s;he wi&s;h, &s;he never had quitted the cloi&s;ter; but there, like the de&s;art ro&s;e, have bloomed and died un|&s;een, in innocence and peace!</P>
<P>THE general, who&s;e fondne&s;s if po&s;&s;ible was encrea&s;ed by her &s;ituation, &s;aid every thing in his power to con&s;ole her, by promi&s;ing to &s;ecure her fame. Many were the expedients he thought of, but none of them &s;eemed &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy the delicate apprehen&s;ions of the unhappy Char|lotte. At length &s;he recollected that there was a young woman in the convent where &s;he had been bred, who&s;e father and mother were dead, and had left her in &s;uch low circum&s;tances that &s;he could neither afford to live in the world, or pay her pen&s;ion where &s;he remained; and was there|fore under the painful nece&s;&s;ity of taking the veil, contrary to her inclinations, or of going into the world as a dependent.</P>
<P>THIS per&s;on then &s;he fixed upon as a con&s;e|derate, and immediately wrote to her to come to Paris, with ample promi&s;es of taking care of her future fortune. Mademoi&s;elle Laval was over|joyed at &s;uch a &s;ummons, and in&s;tantly obeyed it. In the mean time, the general hired a very neat
<PB N="99" REF="99">
furni&s;hed hou&s;e for her reception, and appointed &s;ervants and every thing proper for her arrival.&mdash;She was informed that &s;he was to per&s;onate a lady who&s;e hu&s;band was ju&s;t dead, and who was come from a di&s;tant part of Normandy, to pro&s;ecute a law-&s;uit and lye in at Paris.</P>
<P>THE unhappy &s;ituation of this young woman's circum&s;tances, made her readily acquie&s;ce in every thing that Charlotte required; and &s;he entered her hou&s;e, with all the melancholy &s;o|lemnity of an afflicted relict. In a few days after her arrival, the real mourner, the poor wretch|ed Charlotte, went to vi&s;it her; and after &s;hed|ding a flood of tears upon her bo&s;om, acquaint|ed her with her unhappy &s;ituation and implored her a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>MADEMOISELLE Laval, naturally good na|tured, and &s;oftened by the unhappy condition of her friend, promi&s;ed every thing &s;he could de|&s;ire;&mdash;endeavoured to &s;oothe and comfort her affliction; and at la&s;t, &s;ettled matters in &s;uch a way, that the moment Charlotte found her&s;elf taken ill, &s;he was to go there; that every nece&s;|&s;ary preparation &s;hould he made and every ten|der care taken of her and her offspring.</P>
<P>EVERY thing happened to their utmo&s;t wi&s;hes: &s;he was taken ill as &s;he was dre&s;&s;ing to go to a ball at the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador's. The duches was luckily prevented from going by a &s;light cold; and Charlotte, when &s;he got into the carriage had no one to oppo&s;e her being &s;et down where &s;he plea&s;ed.&mdash;She went directly to her friend's hou&s;e, and was there happily deliver|ed of a &s;on and daughter, who were immediate|ly baptized, by the names of Charles and Char|lotte.</P>
<P>IN as &s;hort a time as was po&s;&s;ible after this event, the general and one of his particular
<PB N="100" REF="100">
friends carried Charlotte home in a &s;edan chair. She &s;aid &s;he had been taken ill at the ball, and went directly to bed, where &s;he continued for &s;ome days; and to carry on the deceit, Made|moi&s;elle Laval confined her&s;elf to her bed and went through all the forms of a real <HI>accouche|ment.</HI></P>
<P>THIS great event &s;o well over, the general thought him&s;elf the happie&s;t man living.&mdash;He doated on his children, and perfectly adored their lovely mother.&mdash;But &s;he continued to appear gloomy, and dejected; and at la&s;t declar|ed, &s;he &s;hould never know peace, while the living witne&s;&s;es of her &s;hame, continued in the &s;ame kingdom with her. She &s;eldom &s;aw them, and when &s;he did, expre&s;&s;ed abhorrence, rather than tenderne&s;s, towards them. She behaved with the utmo&s;t coldne&s;s to the general, and af|fected to be infinitely more mi&s;erable, than &s;he had ever been before.</P>
<P>THE general was almo&s;t di&s;tracted at her con|duct, and at length con&s;ented to the removal of the children. It was agreed that Laval &s;hould go over to England, take upon her the name of Beaumont, and educate them as her own, till the duche&s;s died&mdash;as &s;oon as that &s;hould hap|pen, he promi&s;ed to marry Charlotte, and re|ceive them as the orphans of a near relation.</P>
<P>IN the mean time he &s;ettled a very hand&s;ome income on Laval, and the little innocents &s;et out for London, with their fictitious mother, who felt, however, infinitely more tenderne&s;s for them than their real one &s;eemed to have done.</P>
<P>NOTHING remarkable happened, during their infancy. Mademoi&s;elle Laval, by the general's recommendation, became acquainted with any families of di&s;tinction, and though
<PB N="101" REF="101">
quite unacquainted with the word, behaved her|&s;elf &s;o properly, that &s;he was as much e&s;teemed, as known, and her lovely children univer&s;ally admired.</P>
<P>WHEN they were about &s;even years old, the duche&s;s died, and in as &s;hort a &s;pace as decency would admit of, the general fulfilled his promi&s;e, to his &s;till adored, and beautiful Charlotte. On this occa&s;ion, Mademoi&s;elle Laval, who really doated on her amiable charge, felt the tendere&s;t concern at the thoughts of parting with it&mdash;but &s;he might have &s;pared her &s;orrow, for ma|dame de Beaumont was, by no means, inclined to rob her of it. On the contrary, when the general propo&s;ed the children's return, &s;he grew outrageous, and declared &s;he would never &s;ee him more, if he attempted to bring them into any part of France. She was born to rule his fate, and he &s;ubmitted, though reluctantly, to her in|human, and unnatural commands.</P>
<P>IN about ten months after their marriage, &s;he brought him a &s;on, which, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, con&s;oled him for the lo&s;s of his other children; and, in another year, pre&s;ented him with a daugh|ter. In a little time, his fondne&s;s was wholly transferred to the objects of her adoration.&mdash;Never was &s;o fond a mother; and madame de Beaumont was looked upon as the pattern of ma|ternal affection, while &s;he not only abandoned, but dete&s;ted her former offspring.</P>
<P>THE general's letters to Laval became le&s;s fre|quent; and though he punctually remitted her income, he &s;eldom mentioned tho&s;e, for who&s;e u&s;e it was de&s;igned. In vain poor Laval endea|voured to awaken the tender feelings of a father in his heart, by boa&s;ting the amazing beauty of his Charlotte, or mentioning the fine parts, and accompli&s;hments of his amiable Charles. Na|ture
<PB N="102" REF="102">
&s;eemed dead in him, as much as in their cruel mother.</P>
<P>AT length, worn by the perpetual remon&s;tran|ces of the humane and generou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Laval, he ob|tained a commi&s;&s;ion for his &s;on, who was then about &s;ixteen, in a regiment that was to embark from Dunkirk, for America; but &s;ent &s;trict or|ders that he &s;hould not go to Paris, and conjured Laval to keep him &s;till ignorant of his birth.</P>
<P>POOR Charlotte almo&s;t died away, at the thoughts of being &s;eparated from her brother. It was the fir&s;t cau&s;e &s;he had ever known for &s;or|row, and nature &s;eemed inclined to make them both amends for the lo&s;s of parental affection, by be&s;towing a double portion of fraternal love, on each.</P>
<P>OUR young &s;oldier, who&s;e ardor for glory was extreme, was all gratitude to his &s;uppo&s;ed mo|ther, for &s;uffering him to follow the bent of his inclination; and, at the appointed time, he quit|ted London, with a heart filled at once with bra|very, and tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>IN order to divert the melancholy which af|fected Charlotte for her brother's ab&s;ence, lady Sandford invited the feigned mademoi&s;elle de Beaumont, and her &s;uppo&s;ed daughter, to pa&s;s &s;ome time at her &s;eat in the country. The invi|tation was readily accepted, and there Charlotte, now in her &s;eventeenth year, fir&s;t &s;aw lord Sey|mour.</P>
<P>HER beauty was then only in its dawn, but even then, like Aurora breaking through the clouds, it gave a promi&s;e of the brighte&s;t day. The tender regret &s;he felt for her brother's ab|&s;ence, gave an additional &s;oftne&s;s to her voice, and manners; and the expre&s;&s;ive &s;en&s;ibility of her large hazel eyes, &s;eemed encrea&s;ed by her gentle di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="103">SUCH an amiable object could not fail of in|&s;piring pa&s;&s;ion, in a heart le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible than lord Seymour's, or indeed, any heart, that was not guarded by a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. He &s;oon felt the mo&s;t ardent, and &s;incere affection for her, nor was he the only per&s;on who was &s;en&s;ible of the power of her charms The young duke of B&mdash; &s;aw her at a ball at Northampton, and became in&s;tantly enamoured&mdash;He waited on lady Sandford in a few days after, and with all the precipitancy of youth, high rank, and for|tune, propo&s;ed him&s;elf to mademoi&s;elle de Beau|mont, for her daughter.</P>
<P>WHETHER Charlotte's delicacy was really hurt by &s;uch a proceeding, or whether &s;he then felt a preference for lord Seymour, &s;he in&s;tantly rejected the duke's propo&s;al, with an air of <HI>fierte,</HI> unknown to her before. Mademoi&s;elle de Beau|mont, who tenderly loved her, acquie&s;ced in her determination, and re&s;olved not to acquaint her real parents, that &s;uch a match had been pro|po&s;ed.</P>
<P>CHARLOTTE was tran&s;ported at her feigned mother's kind conde&s;cen&s;ion, and promi&s;ed the mo&s;t implicit obedience, which indeed &s;he had ever &s;hewn to all her commands. She began now to recover her &s;pirits was all chearfulne&s;s, and vivacity: and from this plea&s;ing tran&s;ition, &s;he acquired, if po&s;&s;ible new charms; and each, and every day, lord Seymour became more and more enamoured.</P>
<P>THE two happie&s;t months of Charlotte's life were now pa&s;&s;ed, and mademoi&s;elle de Beau|mont talked of returning to London. Before they &s;et out, lord Seymour found an opportunity of di&s;clo&s;ing his pa&s;&s;ion to Charlotte. She re|ceived his declaration with that frankne&s;s, and candour, that ever dwell with generous minds;
<PB N="104" REF="104">
but at the &s;ame time, told him, that &s;he con&s;i|dered her&s;elf under &s;uch obligations to her mo|ther, for her conduct towards her, in regard to the duke of B&mdash;, that &s;he would never li&s;ten to any per&s;on's addre&s;&s;es, who had not the &s;anc|tion of her approbation.</P>
<P>THE enamoured Seymour, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion was as truly delicate, as the fair object that in&s;pired it, was now at the &s;ummit of felicity&mdash;he threw him&s;elf at Charlotte's feet, and poured forth his &s;oul, in the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of gra|titude, for her generous and unaffected behavi|our; and at the &s;ame time, obtained her leave to apply to mademoi&s;elle de Beaumont for her con&s;ent, as &s;oon as they &s;hould return to Lon|don.</P>
<P>HE was permitted the happine&s;s of attending them thither, and the day after their arrival wait|ed on mademoi&s;elle de Beaumont, to intreat her leave to pay his addre&s;&s;es to her lovely daughter. True love is ever timid, and con&s;cious as lord Seymour was, that the advantage of birth and fortune were on his &s;ide, he felt perhaps more apprehen&s;ions on this occa&s;ion than a young en&s;ign would at addre&s;&s;ing a lady of the highe&s;t rank.</P>
<P>ALL that he knew of Chorlotte's circum&s;tan|ces or condition, was, that her mother pa&s;&s;ed for the widow of a general officer, that her fortune was &s;mall, but &s;ufficient to &s;upport her little family genteelly, with oeconomy; and that &s;he had maintained an unblemi&s;hed reputa|tion in London for near &s;eventeen years.</P>
<P>BUT how were the generous and di&s;intere&s;ted Seymour's fears increa&s;ed, when mademoi&s;elle de Beaumont told him &s;he was highly &s;en&s;ible of the honour he intended her daughter, but that &s;he thought her yet too young to marry, and
<PB N="105" REF="105">
that &s;he had laid her&s;elf under an engagement, never to di&s;po&s;e of Charlotte, without fir&s;t con|&s;ulting her father's family and friends! &s;he con|jured him as a man of honour, not to mention his pa&s;&s;ion to Charlotte, as by in&s;piring her with a mutual one, he might perhaps render them both mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>LORD Seymour in&s;tantly told her it was out of his power to obey her injunction, as it was by Charlotte's permi&s;&s;ion he had then the honour of intreating her con&s;ent, and that he neither could nor would de&s;i&s;t from endeavouring to gain a heart, on which all his happine&s;s in this life depended. Mademoi&s;elle de Beaumont was moved, even to tears, at the unhappy &s;ituation of the lovers. She too plainly &s;aw the ob&s;tacles that mu&s;t prevent their union, but generou&s;ly promi&s;ed and re&s;olved to do every thing in her power for their mutual happine&s;s.</P>
<P>LORD Seymour ventured to remon&s;trate to her, that with regard to the duke of B&mdash;'s propo&s;al, &s;he had acted as &s;ole parent and guar|dian of her daughter, and he could not &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of farther con&s;ultation for accepting, than refu&s;ing a lover. She owned her tenderne&s;s for Charlotte had in that ca&s;e triumphed over her promi&s;e, but &s;he had even then, only a&s;&s;umed a negative power, which was more in right of her daughter, than her&s;elf, for &s;he never could think it ju&s;t, that either parents or friends &s;hould even per&s;uade a per&s;on to marry contrary to their own inclinations. She told him &s;he would write immediately to France, and repre&s;ent his lord|&s;hip's birth, fortune and per&s;on, in the advanta|geous light in which &s;he beheld them.</P>
<P>EXALTED as his ideas were of the object of his pa&s;&s;ion, he had great rea&s;on to flatter him&s;elf, that his alliance would not be contemned by any
<PB N="106" REF="106">
family in France; and when he con&s;idered that the exqui&s;ite perfections of his charming Char|lotte mu&s;t he unknown to tho&s;e per&s;ons, who were to be con&s;ulted in the di&s;po&s;al of them his fears would &s;ometimes vani&s;h, and his fond heart beat, with all the tran&s;porting hopes of &s;ucce&s;sful love.</P>
<P>CHARLOTTE who had never heard made|moi&s;elle de Beaumont talk of her father's family till now, con&s;idered the difficulties that were &s;tarted in another light, and fancied &s;he only meant them to protract the marriage, till &s;he &s;hould be eighteen, which &s;he had often heard her &s;ay, was full early for a young lady to marry. However, without enquiring &s;he perfectly ac|quie&s;ced in her &s;uppo&s;ed mother's conduct, and while &s;he had the happine&s;s of &s;eeing and hearing the tendere&s;t of lovers and mo&s;t charming of men, &s;he knew not a wi&s;h ungratified. Made|moi&s;elle de Beaumont fulfilled her promi&s;e, by writing immediately to the general, and menti|oning lord Seymour in the ju&s;te&s;t and of cour&s;e mo&s;t plea&s;ing light.</P>
<P>IT happened that the general and his lady were at that time at Aix la Chapelle, where he had been &s;eized with a violent fever; and though the letter was forwarded to him, as the charac|ters of the &s;uper&s;cription were known by his lady, it lay for &s;ometime unopened.</P>
<P>DURING this interval the fictitious mademoi|&s;elle de Beaumont was attacked by the &s;mall-pox, which appeared of &s;o malignant a &s;ort, that her fate was quickly pronounced by her phy&s;icians. As &s;oon as &s;he was acquainted with her di&s;order, &s;he forbad Charlotte to come near her, as &s;he had never had it; but in vain &s;he commanded, or lord Seymour entreated her to ab&s;ent her&s;elf a moment from her bed-&s;ide. She &s;aid it was her
<PB N="107" REF="107">
fir&s;t, and &s;hould be her la&s;t act of di&s;obedience; and for that rea&s;on, &s;he hoped her dear and ten|der parent would pardon it.</P>
<P>OVERCOME by her filial piety, they &s;uffered her to undergo &s;uch con&s;tant and violent fatigue, as at any other time, would have de&s;troyed her delicate and beauteous frame. But &s;he &s;upported it with &s;uch a tender alacrity and attention, as amazed and affected every one who &s;aw her: even lord Seymour's love was encrea&s;ed by his admiration of her virtues, and ro&s;e almo&s;t to adoration.</P>
<P>WHEN mademoi&s;elle de Beaumont was in|formed of her danger, which was but a few hours before her death, &s;he de&s;ired to be left alone with Charlotte&mdash;After embracing and im|ploring ble&s;&s;ings on her, &s;he told her that neither her time nor &s;trength, would permit her reveal|ing a &s;ecret that was of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to her. But as &s;he had ever endeavoured to be prepared for the tremendous event that was now come to pa&s;s, &s;he had kept a journal of her life, from the time &s;he quitted the convent de&mdash;, to the moment of her illne&s;s; that in tho&s;e pa|pers &s;he would find her own hi&s;tory included, and that of <HI>her real parents.</HI></P>
<P>CHARLOTTE, though drowned in tears, was all attention, till tho&s;e a&s;toni&s;hing words, <HI>her real parents!</HI> &s;mote her ear.&mdash;She then cried out, ah, madam! will you not only abandon, but deny me? Alas! what has your Charlotte done! Be comforted, my more than daughter, &s;he re|plied; I was not worthy of &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing.&mdash;Yet &s;till, I hope, more worthy than they who po&s;|&s;e&s;s &s;o rich a trea&s;ure, regardle&s;s of its value. But if their hearts, &s;o long hardened to your blooming virtues, at length relent, and give you to the worthy Seymour, you will have no cau&s;e
<PB N="108" REF="108">
to regret their pa&s;t neglect, or court their future protection. May you be happy! This key (tak|ing one from her bo&s;om) will explain what I can|not. And now adieu, for ever!</P>
<P>THE &s;udden effects of &s;urpri&s;e joined to tho&s;e of grief, quite overcame the afflicted Charlotte.&mdash;She fainted, and was conveyed &s;en&s;ele&s;s to her own apartment. Madmoi&s;elle de Beau|mont continued to breathe, till &s;he heard Char|lotte was re&s;tored to life; then yielded up her own.</P>
<P>THE next day Charlotte was &s;eized with con|vul&s;ions; and immediately after the &s;mall-pox appeared, but of a &s;afe and gentle kind&mdash;the malignity of the di&s;order had &s;pent its force upon mademoi&s;elle de Beaumont; and the low &s;tate both of Charlottes mind and body, rendered its operations le&s;s powerful. Lord Seymour never quitted her apartment, though not permitted to enter her chamber; nor could he be prevailed on, even to re&s;t him&s;elf on a couch, till the phy&s;i|cians pronounced her out of danger.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as it was po&s;&s;ible &s;he &s;aw him: he appeared more altered than her&s;elf. Never was &s;uch an interview between two lovers. Their pre&s;ent lo&s;s of beauty &s;eemed to augment their fondne&s;s; and each felt more real tenderne&s;s for the other, than at any former in&s;tant of their lives, Lord Seymour, though he lamented the death of mademoi&s;elle de Beaumont, very &s;in|cerely, now thought that every bar to his hap|pine&s;s was removed; and as Charlotte appeared to be the mi&s;tre&s;s of her own fate, he had no apprehen&s;ions that his could be unhappy.</P>
<P>SHE had laughed at madame de Beaumont's &s;uper&s;titious attachment to di&s;tant relations, whom &s;he had not &s;een for many years, he therefore could not &s;u&s;pect her being inefcted with the
<PB N="109" REF="109">
&s;ame caprice. The mother &s;aid, &s;he was bound by &s;olemn engagements to the family of Beau|mont; the daughter could have entered into none, as &s;he left Paris when an infant. He had therefore, no rea&s;on to imagine that any power on earth could oppo&s;e his felicity; and indulged his fond imagination with re&s;pective views of fancied bli&s;s, which he was fated never to en|joy!</P>
<P>THE &s;mall-pox had been &s;o favourable to Charlotte, that &s;he had not been affected with the lea&s;t mark or alteration of feature; and the natural whitene&s;s of her &s;nowy &s;kin, &s;oon tri|umphed over the tran&s;itory redne&s;s, which is the common effect of that always di&s;agreeable, and &s;ometimes fatal di&s;order.</P>
<P>BUT though her beauty had returned, her chearfulne&s;s &s;eemed buried in mademoi&s;elle de Beaumont's tomb. Her affliction for her as a parent, would perhaps have &s;ub&s;ided into a calm and gentle melancholy; but her la&s;t words had rai&s;ed a tumult in her bo&s;om, which &s;he had not re&s;olution &s;ufficient to conquer. She frequently endeavoured to per&s;uade her&s;elf, that her dear mother had raved in her la&s;t moments; but the &s;trength of her expre&s;&s;ion, and calmne&s;s of her manner, oppo&s;ed that fond belief.</P>
<P>AFTER her recovery, whole weeks elap&s;ed without her having courage to open the cabinet, where the my&s;tery of her fate lay concealed. She feared to meet with new ob&s;tacles to that happine&s;s, which &s;he had promi&s;ed her&s;elf, by being united to lord Seymour.</P>
<P>HIS delicacy had yet prevented him from ex|pre&s;&s;ing his ardent wi&s;hes for their union, as the cau&s;e of her amiable di&s;tre&s;s was yet too recent; and many months might po&s;&s;ibly have pa&s;&s;ed a|way, in the &s;ame irre&s;olution, if the receipt of

<P>NEVE was amazement equal to mine, at peru&s;ing your la&s;t letter! What, you wretch as you are, rai&s;ed by my hand, and &s;upported by my bounty, pre&s;ume to dictate to me in the di&s;po&s;al of my child! And who is this lord Seymour? he is not an heretic? if &s;o that is &s;ufficient objection, were he a prince.</P>
<P>BUT &s;urely, madam, &s;ince you take upon you to inform us of intended marriages, and act as plenipotentiary, between our daughter, and our&s;elves, you &s;hould have informed us of the duke of B&mdash;'s propo&s;al and no more have dared to refu&s;e, than accept, a lover, for Charlotte Beaumont.</P>
<P>THE young duke, him&s;elf, has informed me of his &s;imple attachment to the &s;illy girl, and of the in&s;olence with which his propo&s;al was rejected. He inquired, whether &s;he was of our family? I did as I ever &s;hall, di&s;claim her.</P>
<P>THE general, who has been ill of a fever, by me commands you on receipt of this, to &s;et out with Charlotte Beaumont, in&s;tantly for Paris. He has devoted her to heaven, and found out a fit retreat for that purpo&s;e, in the convent of St. Anthony. Be it your bu&s;ine&s;s as it is your duty, to teach her an implicit obedience, to his will.</P>
<P>SHE is now of age, to be tru&s;ted with the &s;ecret of her birth; but let her al&s;o know,

<P>P.S. The general, and I, &s;hall return to Paris, in a few days, where we expect not to &s;ee, but hear from you and Charlotte.</P>
<P>THE moment you arrive at the hotel An|gloi&s;e, you are commanded to &s;end to the ge|neral; but on no account attempt to come near our hou&s;e.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>THE &s;ituation of the unhappy Charlotte's mind, upon reading this letter, is not to be de&s;|cribed. Who is this cruel woman, &s;he exclaim|ed, that thus di&s;claims an unoffending child? Oh! I will throw my&s;elf beneath her feet, and &s;often that obdurate heart with tears. My father too; I have a father then! Sure he will rai&s;e me up in his parental arms, and ble&s;s me! They will relent; and when they &s;ee my Seymour, and know his wondrous worth, his wondrous love, they will be charmed, as their fond daughter is and give me to his wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>FULL of the&s;e warm, and natural apprehen|&s;ions, the half-di&s;tracted Charlotte flew to the cabinet, which like Pandora's box, contained a thou&s;and ills, and with a trembling hand, un|locked it. The fir&s;t objects that pre&s;ented them|&s;elves to her view, were miniature portraits of her father and mother.&mdash;She gazed with joy and wonder. Never had &s;he beheld &s;uch &s;trik|ing beauty, of both kinds; the manly and the mild.</P>
<P>SHE ki&s;&s;ed, embraced, wept over them; nay, knelt to them, implored their pity and protecti|on, and, in one moment, was in&s;pired with more re&s;pect and tenderne&s;s for tho&s;e inanimate
<PB N="112" REF="112">
figures, than &s;he had ever felt for her &s;uppo&s;ed mother; though gratitude and e&s;teeem had an|&s;wered all her purpo&s;es of filial affection in her gentle nature.</P>
<P>SHE now &s;at down to &s;earch the book of fate, tho&s;e fatal Sybils leaves that told her doom; and while &s;he read, felt every pa&s;&s;ion that the human heart is capable of.&mdash;Yet &s;till her love and re|verence for her parents remained predominant; and &s;he determined to &s;acrifice her&s;elf to their unnatural commands and pa&s;s her days in a cloi&s;ter, if &s;he could not prevail on them to change their cruel purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>SHE quickly &s;aw how improper it would have been to acquaint lord Seymour with her real &s;itu|ation, as he would, doubtle&s;s, oppo&s;e her return|ing to France, with all the eloquence of love.&mdash;Yet to quit him without making any ex|cu&s;e, or to de&s;cend to invent a fal&s;e one, were equally repugnant to her tender and generous nature.</P>
<P>SHE had been bred in the Roman Catholic faith, but had never conver&s;ed with bigots, nor once thought that marrying the man &s;he loved could be deemed a crime again&s;t any religion. The idea fir&s;t &s;hocked her, on her mother's pro|nouncing him a heretic; and &s;he re&s;olved to make the difference of opinions a pretext for po&s;tponing their marriage, till &s;he could prevail upon her parents to give their con&s;ent; which &s;he vainly hoped &s;he &s;hould be able to obtain, from their tenderne&s;s, and his uncommon me|rits.</P>
<P>THEY know the power of love, &s;aid &s;he, and will not, like vulgar, and unfeeling minds, at|tempt to oppo&s;e his uncontroulable decrees.&mdash;They will regard lord Seymour, for their Char|lotte's &s;ake; and his tenderne&s;s for me &s;hall ap|pear
<PB N="113" REF="113">
by that love and duty that he &s;hews to them.</P>
<P>THUS did the unhappy vi&s;ionary fair one amu&s;e her&s;elf, till lord Seymour came to pay his daily vi&s;it. He had been u&s;ed for &s;ome time pa&s;t, to &s;ee her melancholy, and, at times, di&s;|turbed; but as &s;oon as he then &s;aw her, he per|ceived that her whole frame had been uncom|monly agitated. And when he tenderly intreated to know the cau&s;e, &s;he an&s;wered only with a flood of tears; and begged he would not pre&s;s her on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>THOUGH his fond heart was alarmed by a thou&s;and different fears, he cho&s;e rather to bear that cruel &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, than di&s;tre&s;s the ob|ject he adored; and immediately de&s;i&s;ted from any further inquiries. When he left her that evening, he felt an unu&s;ual degree of anxiety, and was &s;everal times tempted to return, and beg to know the &s;ource of her di&s;tre&s;s; but he feared to offend, by di&s;obeying her commands; and hoped, at their next meeting, her chagrin might be di&s;pelled.</P>
<P>LORD Seymour was to go out of town for a few days, to the nuptials of a near relation; and his loved Charlotte had bid him adieu, with a more than u&s;ual tenderne&s;s. Charlotte re&s;olved to lay hold on the opportunity of lord Seymour's ab&s;ence, to &s;et out for France. She had found in the late madame de Beaumont's cabinet about two hundred pounds, in bills and money; out of this &s;um &s;he di&s;charged all her &s;ervants except her own maid, whom &s;he determined to take with her. She ordered one of tho&s;e &s;he parted with, to remain in the hou&s;e, till lord Seymour's return, in order to deliver him a letter, which &s;he &s;hould leave for him.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="114">SHE had now, &s;he thought, &s;ettled matters in &s;uch a way, that nothing remained to ob&s;truct her purpo&s;ed journey.&mdash;But, alas! the more difficult part of her arduous ta&s;k, was yet to come&mdash;She was now to bid adieu to the man her &s;oul adored. She knew not what pa&s;&s;ion was, till the &s;everity of her fate compelled her to wi&s;h to conquer it. A thou&s;and times &s;he attempted to write to him, who was now dearer than ever to her, but could not find words that were capa|ble of expre&s;&s;ing her complicated feelings.&mdash;Two &s;leeple&s;s nights, and mi&s;erable days thus pa&s;&s;ed. She dreaded lord Seymour's return; and on the third, while the chai&s;e waited to carry her off, &s;he wrote the following lines.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD><HI>To Lord</HI> SEYMOUR.</HEAD>
<P>WITH a heart and eyes overflowing with the &s;incere&s;t tenderne&s;s, at the &s;ad thought of being &s;eparated from the only man I ever did, or ever &s;hall love, I find my&s;elf incapable of taking even a tran&s;ient leave of him. Oh! may it prove &s;o!</P>
<P>My flight mu&s;t appear extraordinary to you. Why am I not at liberty to explain my motives? But be a&s;&s;ured, they are &s;uch as your honour and virtue would approve, though your fondne&s;s might oppo&s;e the effect. I fly then, my dear lord Seymour, to render my|&s;elf worthy of you; to ea&s;e my heart of &s;ome &s;cruples which, only, can prevent its being wholly yours.</P>
<P>IF heaven &s;miles upon my purpo&s;e, you &s;hall hear quickly from me; and &s;urely inno|cence and love, &s;o pure as mine, may claim its care. But &s;hould it, for wi&s;e purpo&s;es, unknown to me, bla&s;t all my flattering hopes
<PB N="115" REF="115">
of happine&s;s, and doom me to the lowe&s;t wretchedne&s;s, thy image &s;till &s;hall dwell within my heart, and &s;hield it from di&s;ho|nour.</P>
<P>I WOULD &s;ay more, but cannot; the chai&s;e waits to carry me&mdash;from whom! from thee! What agonies are in that thought! Nought but the hope of meeting &s;oon again, could now enable me to &s;ay,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he had &s;ealed her letter, &s;he flung her&s;elf into the chai&s;e, and pur&s;ued her journey; which &s;he performed without meeting with any uncommon accident.</P>
<P>IN a few hours after &s;he &s;et out, her brother, who had been near two years ab&s;ent, returned to London. His bravery had rai&s;ed him to the rank of captain; and, as the war was then over, he had obtained leave to vi&s;it his friends in England.</P>
<P>HE had not heard of mademoi&s;elle de Beau|mont's death, till he came to her hou&s;e, and was at once informed of that and Charlotte's abrupt departure. The amiable young man was ex|tremely &s;hocked and grieved; and in the mid&s;t of his tears for mademoi&s;elle de Beaumont, la|mented the uncertainty of his loved &s;i&s;ter's fate; and determined, as &s;oon as it was po&s;&s;ible, to pur&s;ue her &s;teps to Paris.</P>
<P>JUST as he was quitting the hou&s;e, his eyes &s;woln with tears, and his a&s;pect impre&s;&s;ed with the deepe&s;t &s;orrow, lord Seymour came to the door.&mdash;Young Beaumont i&s;&s;ued out, regardle&s;s of a man he had never &s;een before; and lord Sey|mour,
<PB N="116" REF="116">
though at fir&s;t &s;urprized at his appearance, upon receiving Charlotte's letter, thought of him no more.</P>
<P>INDEED all traces of recollection &s;eemed to have been in&s;tantly era&s;ed from his memory, and he remained like a man &s;uddenly transfixed by lightning. It was &s;ome time before he had power to a&s;k when &s;he &s;et out? or whither &s;he was gone? And when the &s;ervant replied to his queries, he continued to repeat them, without receiving the information he &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired.</P>
<P>HE read her letter a thou&s;and times, yet would neither credit that nor the &s;ervant's affirmation, that &s;he had left the hou&s;e.&mdash;He ran di&s;tractedly through every room, calling on his dear Char|lotte's name; and crying out, It is impo&s;&s;ible! &s;he mu&s;t be here! O do not kill me for thy &s;port, my love! But when he found his &s;earch was in vain, he retired to his hou&s;e, in a &s;tate very lit|tle &s;hort of di&s;traction.</P>
<P>THE moment our fair fugitive landed at Ca|lais, &s;he wrote a letter to each of her parents, filled with expre&s;&s;ions of the humble&s;t duty, and tendere&s;t affection. She acquainted them with the death of her &s;uppo&s;ed mother, and men|tioned her obligations to her with the highe&s;t gra|titude and e&s;teem. She implored their permi&s;&s;ion to throw her&s;elf at their feet, and that they would allow her a happine&s;s &s;he had been &s;o long de|prived of, that of receiving a parent's ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>IN vain, was her tender and virtuous mind, enriched with every noble and generous &s;enti|ment, that could do honour to humanity; her cruel parents were literally in the &s;tate of the <HI>deaf adder</HI>: they &s;hut their ears and eyes to her perfections; and refu&s;ed to receive the highe&s;t
<PB N="117" REF="117">
plea&s;ure that human nature is capable of, that of beholding an amiable and accompli&s;hed child.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as &s;he arrived at the hotel Angloi&s;e, &s;he found a &s;ervant waiting with a letter for her, which contained the&s;e words.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>UPON reading this letter, all the tender ideas of filial affection, which had thronged about poor Charlotte's heart, &s;eemed to vani&s;h, and the poignant angui&s;h &s;he had felt, at tearing her&s;elf from her fond and generous lover, returned with double force.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="118">SHE, however, determined not to halt at be|ginning the race; and turning to her conductor, with the utmo&s;t mildne&s;s and re&s;ignation, &s;aid &s;he was ready to attend him; and hoped when &s;he was lodged for the night, he would do her the fa|vour to wait till &s;he &s;hould write a few lines to madame de Beaumont.</P>
<P>HE told her he was ordered not to bring back any letter or me&s;&s;age, and hoped &s;he would not take his refu&s;al ill, as he dur&s;t not venture to di&s;obey&mdash;The tears now forced their way into Charlotte's eyes. She told the &s;ervant &s;he would not be the cau&s;e of his di&s;obedience on any ac|count; and that &s;he was ready to follow him.</P>
<P>HE put her and her maid into a chariot, and directed the coachman where he was to go. When they alighted, they were &s;hewn into a very ele|gant apartment; and her conductor, after in|quiring whether &s;he wanted money, or any far|ther a&s;&s;i&s;tance from him, being an&s;wered in the negative, bowed and withdrew.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as he was gone, the now mi&s;era|ble Charlotte gave vent to all her &s;orrows; &s;he threw her&s;elf upon the ground, and wa&s;hed it with her tears. Her affectionate &s;ervant, who had lived with her from her infancy, without knowing the cau&s;e of her di&s;tre&s;s, vainly endeavoured to con|&s;ole her; intreated her to return to England; and talked of lord Seymour's love and con&s;tancy.</P>
<P>HER every word &s;truck daggers to the unhap|py Charlotte's heart&mdash;As &s;oon as &s;he was able to &s;peak, &s;he told her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;he mu&s;t part with her the next day; that &s;he determined to go into a convent for &s;ome time; and advi&s;ed her to &s;et out immediately for London. The poor girl, who truly loved her, was almo&s;t di&s;tracted, at &s;eeing and hearing her mi&s;tre&s;s look and &s;peak &s;o: and po&s;itively declared &s;he would never leave
<PB N="119" REF="119">
her, let her determination in life be what it would.</P>
<P>CHARLOTTE peremptorily in&s;i&s;ted on di&s;|charging her from her &s;ervice; but told her &s;he would &s;upport her in Paris, while her money la&s;ted, and that &s;he might &s;ometimes &s;ee her at the convent. This, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, quieted the poor &s;ervant's anxiety; but Charlotte's unhap|pine&s;s increa&s;ed every hour.&mdash;She went not to bed, and the pearly drops remained on her fair cheek, when the &s;un had exhaled tho&s;e of the dew.</P>
<P>SHE wrote a few lines to let lord Seymour know that &s;he was going into the convent of St. Anthony; and, in her di&s;traction, gave the let|ter to her made to deliver, without reflecting that the faithful Nannette had re&s;olved not to quit Pa|ris, till her mi&s;tre&s;s's fate was determined.</P>
<P>IN the morning &s;he dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf, and endea|voured to a&s;&s;ume an air of compo&s;ure and tran|quility, with a breaking heart. About ten o'clock, the &s;ame per&s;on who had attended her the night before, came in a coach, accompanied by madame de Beaumont's woman, who pre&s;ent|ed her with the following letter:</P>

<P>BOTH the general and I, are much plea&s;ed with the accounts we have received of your behaviour. Any remon&s;trance again&s;t our com|mands, would be at once pre&s;umptuous and vain. Continue, therefore, to de&s;erve our fa|vour, by a &s;ilent and unlimited obedience.</P>

<P>P.S. You are expected to enter upon your noviciate immediately.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>CHARLOTTE received this cruel &s;entence with amazing fortitude. To her perturbed and wretched &s;tate of mind, the quieter a&s;ylum of a cloi&s;ter, appeared not undelightful; and had not her pa&s;&s;ion for lord Seymour revolted again&s;t the &s;everity of her doom, &s;he might have been led like a lamb to the &s;acrifice, without a &s;igh or groan.</P>
<P>MADAME de Beaumont's la&s;t letter &s;eemed le&s;s <HI>farouche</HI> than her former one; and this en|couraged Charlotte to hope, that time and her obedience might po&s;&s;ibly awaken the tender feel|ings of maternal love, in her hitherto obdurate brea&s;t. She inquired whether &s;he might be per|mitted to return her thanks for madame de Beau|mont's favour in writing? and was again an&s;wer|ed in the negative.</P>
<P>SHE took a mo&s;t affectionate leave of her di&s;|con&s;olate maid, who followed the coach at a di&s;|tance, and &s;aw her enter tho&s;e gates through which &s;he was never to pa&s;s again.</P>
<P>WHEN they arrived at the convent, madame de Beaumont's woman pre&s;ented Charlotte to the abbe&s;s, as a willing victim. She was, therefore, received with every outward mark of e&s;teem; and the gro&s;&s;e&s;t flattery was lavi&s;hed by the whole &s;i&s;|terhood, on tho&s;e charms, which they vainly imagined an acceptable &s;acrifice to the great cre|ator of them.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="121">DELUDED mortals!&mdash;the heart alone is all that he requires! nor do the tender charities of life, the love of parents, hu&s;band, brethren, children, pollute the oblation, but render it more plea&s;ing in his &s;ight, who fir&s;t ordained, then &s;anctified the&s;e natural ties.</P>
<P>CHARLOTTE &s;hewed not the lea&s;t reluctance at entering on her prohibition.&mdash;She knew that a year mu&s;t elap&s;e, before &s;he could be compelled to take the veil; and &s;till flattered her&s;elf that fate would di&s;po&s;e of her in another way, before that time &s;hould expire. She imagined, that by a &s;eeming acquie&s;cence, &s;he might be able to le&s;|&s;en, if not entirely remove, any re&s;traint they might otherwi&s;e have been impo&s;ed upon her.</P>
<P>SHE made no doubt, that lord Seymour's pa&s;|&s;ion would prompt him to pur&s;ue her; and &s;he fully determined to acquaint him with every cir|cum&s;tance of her life, if &s;he &s;hould ever have an opportunity. For this purpo&s;e, &s;he employed every lei&s;ure moment &s;he was mi&s;tre&s;s of, in framing a little hi&s;tory, from the papers &s;he had found in the cabinet, with the additional circum|&s;tances that had happened from the time of her leaving London.</P>
<P>AS &s;he &s;carce ever appeared in the parlour, or at the grate, the &s;i&s;terhood beheld her as the paragon of &s;anctity; and her edifying example was quoted as a pattern for all the young ladies in the convent. The little ta&s;k &s;he had impo&s;ed on her&s;elf, by amu&s;ing her mind, kept up her &s;pi|rits, &s;o that &s;he &s;eemed to have acquired a con|&s;tant habit of chearfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT when her work was fini&s;hed, and two monts had elap&s;ed, without hearing from her father, mother, or what was &s;till more inte|re&s;ting, her lover, &s;he fell into a lowne&s;s of &s;pi|rits, which terminated in a &s;low fever. She now
<PB N="122" REF="122">
looked upon her&s;elf as abandoned by all the world; and the cruel &s;u&s;picion of lord Seymour's incon&s;tancy, perfectly reconciled her to the gloo|my pro&s;pect of perpetual &s;eclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>HER faithful &s;ervant continued to &s;ee her fre|quently, and as often mingled her tears with tho&s;e of her unhappy mi&s;tre&s;s. As &s;he was one day mu&s;ing on the uncommon mi&s;eries of her fate, her maid approached her with unu&s;ual chearfulne&s;s, and cried out, O, Madam! he is come.</P>
<P>A TRANSITORY joy now &s;parkled in Char|lotte's eyes and the &s;oft bloom that had for&s;aken her cheek, returned with added blu&s;hes. Where is he? &s;he replied; and ah! how could he &s;tay &s;o long! Did&s;t thou &s;ee him, Nannette, and has he mourned my ab&s;ence?</P>
<P>AT that in&s;tant, one of the lay &s;i&s;ters came to inform Charlotte, that a gentleman de&s;ired to &s;ee her. She flew to the grate, but how was her &s;urprize encrea&s;ed when in&s;tead of lord Sey|mour &s;he beheld her brother?</P>
<P>IF any thing could have abated her joy at &s;ee|ing him, it mu&s;t have been the di&s;appointment &s;he felt, at not meeting lord Seymour. But though her expectation had been highly rai&s;ed with the plea&s;ing hope of &s;uch an interview, &s;he was &s;incerely rejoice at the unexpected &s;ight of her much beloved brother.</P>
<P>HE immediately began to expo&s;tulate with her, on quitting England; and earne&s;tly in|treated her to leave the convent, and put her&s;elf under his protection. She told him that was not at pre&s;ent in her power, as &s;he was then in her noviciate, but promi&s;ed not to take the veil, without his approbation, which &s;he was certain would follow every action of her life, when he was acquainted with the motives; and, in order
<PB N="123" REF="123">
to explain both her &s;ituation and his own, &s;he would &s;end him &s;ome papers to peru&s;e which were of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to them both.</P>
<P>CAPTAIN Beaumont was a&s;toni&s;hed at the my&s;terious manner which accompanied his &s;i&s;ter's words; but as he had the highe&s;t opinion of her honour and under&s;tanding, he, for the pre&s;ent, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed his curio&s;ity about the &s;ecrets &s;he hint|ed at, and retired to his lodgings, to wait till Nannette &s;hould bring an explanation of the my&s;tery, in which he found his innocent and un|happy &s;i&s;ter involved.</P>
<P>CAPTAIN Beaumont had left London, the day after his &s;i&s;ter, and ea&s;ily traced her through the progre&s;s of her journey; but when he arriv|ed at Paris, as he had no clue to guide him, he wandered near three months in pur&s;uit of her, and but for the accidental meeting of Nannette in the &s;treet, he might have &s;pent as many years in the &s;ame fruitle&s;s inquiry.</P>
<P>LORD Seymour, who&s;e ardour and impati|ence to recover his lo&s;t fair one, was ever more &s;anguine than a brother's could be, was not &s;o early in his pur&s;uit. The agitation of his mind, upon receiving Charlotte's letter, had thrown him into a violent fever, and it was above three weeks before he was able to follow his fair fugi|tive.</P>
<P>WHEN he came to Paris, he was much at a lo&s;s to direct his inquiries as her brother had been&mdash;he had heard of her along the road, and al&s;o of captain Beaumont's following her; and from the de&s;cription he received of him, had no doubt of his being the &s;ame per&s;on he had &s;een at her hou&s;e, the day &s;he left it.</P>
<P>LOVE and jealou&s;y are twins, and it is impo&s;|&s;ible to defend the heart from one, if you admit the other. It was apparent to him that this per|&s;on
<PB N="124" REF="124">
and Charlotte were connected; and his ne|ver having &s;een or heard of him, increa&s;ed his apprehen&s;ions of his being a favourite lover. Yet why, if that were the ca&s;e, &s;hould Char|lotte continue to deceive him? why write &s;uch a tender and affectionate adieu? he knew not, un|le&s;s it were to lull his fears to &s;leep, and prevent his endangering her lover's &s;afety. Thus did the unhappy Seymour increa&s;e his own calami|ties, and drag about a wretched lifele&s;s form, to every public place in Paris, in the fond hope of meeting tho&s;e tran&s;cendant charms that were now buried in a cloi&s;ter.</P>
<P>THE &s;ight of her brother had rai&s;ed poor Charlotte's &s;pirits, by reviving her hopes of getting out of the convent. Yet of what u&s;e would &s;he exclaim, is liberty, without love? Seymour abandons me, and the world it&s;elf is now become a &s;olitude to me more gloomy even than this cell. But grant his love and con|&s;tancy &s;hould &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and that he is this mo|ment as wretched as my&s;elf, could he receive into his family the <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>rejected</HI> daughter of &s;uch cruel parents! no, there is no re&s;ource for me on earth; the&s;e walls for ever mu&s;t confine this haple&s;s frame; my heart alone is free, and flies of cour&s;e to him!</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as &s;he had lei&s;ure &s;he inclo&s;ed made|moi&s;elle de Beaumont's papers, her father and mother's pictures, with a letter from her&s;elf to her brother, acquainting him with every thing that had pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ince her arrival in France, and intreating him not to mention the affinity bet|ween them at the convent, le&s;t it &s;hould give offence to their parents, and occa&s;ion their being re&s;trained from &s;eeing each other for the future. She earne&s;tly implored his protection and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, toward relea&s;ing her from the &s;tate &s;he was
<PB N="125" REF="125">
in, and promi&s;ed to be guided by him, in every action of her life.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the inhuman treat|ment that Charlotte had met with on peru&s;ing the papers, captain Beaumont was tran&s;ported at finding him&s;elf &s;o nearly related to the gene|ral&mdash;the pride of blood is inherent; and the &s;an|guine hope of preferment, from &s;uch a high de&s;cent, dazzled his rea&s;on. He flew directly to his &s;i&s;ter, and told her with the precipitancy natural to a young man, that he was rejoiced at the di&s;covery, and would go and throw him&s;elf at his father's feet, without having the lea&s;t doubt of a favourable reception.</P>
<P>IN vain Charlotte remon&s;trated again&s;t &s;uch an unadvi&s;ed proceeding, and mentioned to hu|mility of her own conduct, and the &s;everity of her parents, notwith&s;tanding; in order to deter him from making the experiment. She feared that his approaching the general without any introduction, would be con&s;trued into want of re&s;pect, and that &s;he &s;hould be condemned for informing him that he had a right to do &s;o&mdash;but he was not to be re&s;traned.</P>
<P>SHE pa&s;&s;ed the night under the mo&s;t gloomy apprehen&s;ion, yet would often &s;ay to her&s;elf, what have I to fear? can I be made more wretch|ed? let me then receive the only con&s;olation that remains for mi&s;ery like mine, the knowing that any change mu&s;t be for the better. Haple&s;s maid! a change will come, that &s;hall render your pre&s;ent &s;tate by &s;ad compari&s;on, a &s;cene of &s;oft tranquility and ea&s;e.</P>
<P>THE next evening, on being informed that captain Beaumont was in the parlour, &s;he flew to receive him; and after a&s;king a thou&s;and que&s;tions with her eyes and tongue, &s;he laid her cheek clo&s;e to the grate to li&s;ten to his an&s;wers.
<PB N="126" REF="126">
At that in&s;tant &s;he beheld lord Seymour entering the room. The agitation of her mind, was now encrea&s;ed almo&s;t to di&s;traction: &s;he knew not what &s;he &s;aid or did; and was utterly incapable of expre&s;&s;ing the joy &s;he felt at &s;eeing the dear idol of her &s;oul. Her brother appeared dejected and unhappy; and the mi&s;taken Seymour attri|buted her confu&s;ion and his melancholy, to mo|tives which their &s;ouls were &s;trangers to.</P>
<P>WE have already hinted that jealou&s;y had in|fected his noble nature; but &s;eeing the object of it, with the woman he adored, added a thou&s;and &s;tings; and he now felt, in the &s;upreme&s;t de|gree, its poignant angui&s;h. His behaviour to Charlotte was con&s;trained and cold. He told her he was indebted to that gentleman, pointing to her brother, for the happine&s;s of &s;eeing her: as he could not ea&s;ily forget his having met him at her hou&s;e, the morning &s;he left London, he naturally &s;uppo&s;ed he could inform him where &s;he was; and having accidentally &s;een him ju&s;t then enter the convent, he had taken the liberty to inquire for her, and hoped &s;he would pardon his intru&s;ion. He added, that he &s;hould leave Paris in a few days, and de&s;ired to know if &s;he had any commands to England.</P>
<P>THOUGH Charlotte was a&s;toni&s;hed at his be|haviour, &s;he had however penetration enough to di&s;cover the cau&s;e, and &s;aid &s;he hoped &s;he &s;hould be able to prevail on him to prolong his &s;tay, as &s;he flattered her&s;elf with the thoughts of return|ing to England in a few months, and &s;hould wi&s;h to have him her conductor.</P>
<P>HE bowed, and replied he &s;hould think him&s;elf happy to be of any &s;ervice to her, provided he did not interfere with another per&s;ons right; but as he believed that gentleman was her chief mo|tive for vi&s;iting France, he was doubtle&s;s entitled
<PB N="127" REF="127">
to the, honour of attending her to England, or wherever el&s;e &s;he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>CHARLOTTE was rendered mi&s;erable, by lord Seymour's &s;u&s;picions; yet as there was other company in the parlour, &s;he knew not how to obviate them, as &s;he was yet ignorant, whe|ther &s;he might dare to own captain Beaumont for her brother. The latter was much &s;urprized at lord Seymour's manner.&mdash;He knew not of any connection between Charlotte and him, and thought her too conde&s;cending.</P>
<P>THE re&s;t of the time they &s;taid, was pa&s;&s;ed in a con&s;trained and difficult &s;ituation. How|ever, Charlotte found, and &s;eized an opportunity of &s;peaking the words that are quoted in her letter to lord Seymour, already related, before the gentleman withdrew.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'MY deare&s;t Henry, let not appearances di&s;|turb your mind; I can, and I will, account for every action of my life to you.&mdash;Let your &s;er|vant attend at the grate to-morrow, for a let|ter from me, and you &s;hall be fully &s;atisfied.'</Q></P>
<P>THOUGH Charlotte's mind was perplexed with a thou&s;and doubts and fears, both for her brother and her&s;elf, the tran&s;port of having &s;een lord Seymour, triumphed over them all; and &s;he once again enjoyed a tran&s;ient gleam of happine&s;s. She knew it was in her power to re|move all his &s;u&s;picions: &s;he neither doubted his love nor honour; and was certain he would a&s;|&s;i&s;t her in getting out of the convent, &s;hould they attempt to compel her to take the veil.</P>
<P>AFTER writing a few lines to lord Seymour, and making up her pacquet for him, &s;he lay down to re&s;t, with a heart more at ea&s;e, than &s;he had ever felt, &s;ince the death of mademoi&s;elle

</LETTER>
<P>NOTHING, but the immediate lo&s;s of her &s;en&s;es, could have pre&s;erved her life.&mdash;She &s;unk motionle&s;s upon the ground; and nature by be|ing totally over-powered, afforded &s;ome little re&s;|pite to her di&s;tracted mind. She remained in this &s;ituation, till the nuns, alarmed at her ab&s;ence from the chapel, came to &s;eek her in her cell. But when their cruel care had brought her &s;o far back, as to &s;hew &s;ome &s;igns of life, &s;he could neither &s;peak, nor weep. She appeared like grief per&s;onified. She neither beat her bo&s;om, rent her hair, or committed any act of outrage, but continued almo&s;t immoveable, till a letter was brought her from madame de Beaumont, which contained the&s;e words:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>ACCURSED be the hour that gave thee birth, and doubly cur&s;ed the moment when thy pretended filial piety brought thee back to France, to ruin and de&s;troy the peace of them, who had been ble&s;&s;ed, if thou had&s;t never been born! Why, parricide, and fratricide in one, did&s;t thou inform the unhappy wretch, who is now fallen a victim to thy vices, of his affinity to us? Thy father never will &s;urmount the &s;hock which he

</LETTER>
<P>WE might &s;uppo&s;e that when the unhappy Charlotte had read her brother's note, her mi&s;e|ries could &s;carce admit addition; but her inhuman mother's letter convinced her that the cup of &s;or|row, though &s;eemingly brim-full, is always capa|ble of increa&s;e.</P>
<P>SHE was &s;eized with inexpre&s;&s;ible terrors at the thoughts of being &s;ent to <HI>La Salpetriere.</HI> She was &s;en&s;ible the abbe&s;s and nuns where &s;he then was, treated her with the utmo&s;t kindne&s;s: for as they looked upon her as a voluntary victim, &s;he had never experienced the lea&s;t re&s;traint, but what the common rules of the hou&s;e pre&s;cribed. She had been accu&s;tomed to the tendere&s;t treat|ment all her life; and her pre&s;ent melancholy &s;i|tuation demanded it more than ever.</P>
<P>AFTER peru&s;ing the cruel anathema, that doomed her to &s;till greater mi&s;eries, &s;he flew in|to the abbe&s;s's apartment, and pro&s;trating her&s;elf before her, with a flood of tears implored her pity, and protection. The good woman was moved at her di&s;tre&s;s; and rai&s;ing her from the ground, a&s;&s;ured her that no authority except the expre&s;s order of the king, &s;hould force her from that hou&s;e; and that if her enemies &s;hould at|tempt to procure a mandate, by any fal&s;e repre|&s;entation,
<PB N="130" REF="130">
&s;he would exert her utmo&s;t abilities to protect her.</P>
<P>CHARLOTTE now con&s;idered the ab&s;olute impo&s;&s;ibility of any future connection with lord Seymour, and therefore looked upon her conti|nuance in the convent of <HI>St. Anthony,</HI> as an a&s;y|lum mo&s;t devoutly to he wi&s;hed for. She thank|ed the abbe&s;s on her knees; and would at that in&s;tant have taken the veil, without repining, if they could have abridged the time of her proba|tion.</P>
<P>SHE had now no longer any terms to keep with madame de Beaumont; and therefore men|tioned the misfortunes her brother had met with, and entreated the abbe&s;s's permi&s;&s;ion, to &s;end hourly to inquire his health. Her reque&s;t was granted; and &s;he retired to her cell in &s;ome de|gree le&s;s wretched than &s;he had left it.</P>
<P>BUT when her tortured imagination repre&s;ent|ed her &s;till dear lord Seymour, as the executio|ner of her brother, her grief was without bounds. Yes, &s;he would &s;ay, I am, indeed, accur&s;ed! well does my mother &s;tile me &s;o.&mdash;Yet are they cruel words, to pa&s;s maternal lips! Oh! had &s;he but once ble&s;&s;ed me, I could not be the wretch I am.</P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the various emoti|ons of her di&s;tracted mind; yet &s;till love re|mained triumphant; and &s;he &s;trove in vain, to pur&s;ue what &s;he thought the dictates of her duty, the hating of lord Seymour.</P>
<P>CAPTAIN Beaumont continued to langui&s;h, without hopes, for near three months; during which time, &s;he received the following letter from Lord Seymour.</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="131" REF="131">

<P>THERE wanted but this la&s;t &s;troke, to render Charlotte the verie&s;t wretch on earth. She had flattered her&s;elf, that lord Seymour had quitted <HI>France,</HI> immediately after the duel, and that his life at lea&s;t was &s;afe; and that, at &s;ome time or other, &s;he &s;hould be able to convince him of his error, and her innocence. But now &s;he beheld him wilfully devoting him&s;elf to the rack, and &s;uffering torture, greater than even that can in|flict from his mi&s;taken opinion of her incon|&s;tancy.</P>
<P>IT was impo&s;&s;ible that her delicate frame could longer &s;upport the complicated agonies that a&s;|&s;ailed
<PB N="132" REF="132">
her mind. She fell into a raging fever: during her delirium, &s;he raved ince&s;&s;antly of racks, and gibbets, of &s;natching Seymour from them, and &s;uffering in his place. At length, however, the natural goodne&s;s of her con&s;tituti|on, and her blooming youth &s;urmounted this dreadful di&s;order, and her rea&s;on and wretched|ne&s;s returned together.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t gleam of peace that broke through the horrors of her fate, were &s;ome &s;mall hopes of her brother's recovery; and in con&s;equence of tho&s;e hopes, &s;he by a &s;olemn vow devoted her&s;elf to heaven, if it &s;hould be plea&s;ed to &s;pare his life.

<P>HE then gave her an account of the interview he had with his father, and of the di&s;gu&s;t and &s;urprize, which the general expre&s;&s;ed at &s;eeing him; and that he had peremptorily commanded him to quit Paris, and join his regiment immedi|ately; and farther informed him, that if he at|tempted to di&s;obey, he would have him broke with infamy.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="133">HE &s;aid, he had however, rea&s;on to hope that the misfortunes he had met with, had &s;oftened his father's heart, as he had been attended during his illne&s;s, by the fir&s;t &s;urgeons in Paris, who came to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance un&s;ent for, and unpaid by him; and that if his &s;ufferings had made his fa|ther relent, he &s;hould for ever ble&s;s the hand that had inflicted them.</P>
<P>THE plea&s;ing hope of her brother's recovery, was the mo&s;t healing balm that could have been admini&s;tered to Charlotte's wounded heart. She no longer trembled for his life, or what was dearer &s;till, lord Seymour's; and &s;he began in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to be reconciled to her fate, mere|ly by reflecting, that it might have been more wretched.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all her efforts now to conquer it, her pa&s;&s;ion for lord Seymour remained undimini&s;hed, and &s;he would have given worlds, had &s;he been mi&s;tre&s;s of them, to undeceive him. But though her faithful Nannette had made the mo&s;t diligent &s;earch for him, from the time that captain Beaumont was pronounced out of danger, &s;he could not di&s;cover his retreat.</P>
<P>THE time now approached for Charlotte's ful|filling the vow &s;he had made to heaven, by taking the veil. The cruel madame de Beaumont had made &s;everal fruitle&s;s efforts to prevail on the abbe&s;s to &s;uffer her removal to another convent; but as &s;he feared to appear publickly in &s;oliciting it, le&s;t the affinity between them &s;hould be re|vealed, &s;he at la&s;t contented her&s;elf with endea|vouring to enforce the utmo&s;t &s;trictne&s;s and &s;eve|rity, which their rules would admit of; with which the poor innocent &s;acrifice unreluctantly complied.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as captain Beaumont was tolerably recovered, he wrote again to his &s;i&s;ter, to inform
<PB N="134" REF="134">
her, that he had received an order from his co|lonel to join his regiment immediately; and at the &s;ame time, a po&s;itive command from his fa|ther to leave Paris without &s;eeing her. He con|jured her in the &s;tronge&s;t terms to renounce the veil, and to fly to lord Seymour for protection; and told her he was certain, that his lord&s;hip was &s;till in Paris, as he had ju&s;t then di&s;covered that he was the per&s;on who appointed and paid the &s;urgeons for their attendance on him.</P>
<P>THE fair di&s;con&s;olate was now &s;o enured to affliction, that &s;he bore this fre&s;h mark of her pa|rents, inhumanity with gentlene&s;s and re&s;ignati|on; but alas! there was a woe &s;uperior far to all they could inflict, and which like Aron's rod, had &s;wallowed up the re&s;t. Lord Seymour thought her guilty &s;till!</P>
<P>SHE had pre&s;erved the pacquet &s;he had made up for him, on the evening of their la&s;t inter|view; and on the day preceding that, on which &s;he was to make her vows, &s;he received the fol|lowing lines from him.</P>

&s;hew you the ab&s;urdity of being alarmed on &s;uch an occa&s;ion. Lord Woodville is now in his eight-and-twentieth year, and has lived both in forreign courts, and at home, as much in the gay world, as any man in England.&mdash;And can my dear Emily really &s;uppo&s;e that &s;he was the fir&s;t object of his love?&mdash;Impo&s;&s;ible! It is much more rea&s;onable to imagine that he had felt that pa&s;&s;ion half a dozen times, at lea&s;t, before &s;he was out of her hanging &s;leeves.</P>
<P>BUT all girls flatter them&s;elves with the entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an hu&s;band's heart; which if he happens as in your ca&s;e, to be &s;even or eight years older than her, is no more in his power to be&s;tow, than youth or beauty. But if he gene|rou&s;ly grants you all that remains at that time in his gift, you have not the lea&s;t right to com|plain; and this, I firmly believe lord Woodville has done. Beware, then my Emily, of appear|ing ungrateful for this pre&s;ent; nor let him ever &s;ee that you do not con&s;ider, even the remnant of his heart, as a full equivalent for all your own. This I mu&s;t confe&s;s to be a very unequal lot of affections; but the conditions of life &s;hould be acquie&s;ced in, without too much refin|ing&mdash;</P>
<P>THERE never was an higher in&s;tance of de|licacy than lord Woodville's behaviour to you, in con&s;equence of the temple adventure; but do not give him too frequent opportunities of exert|ing his gallantry:&mdash;you are a mu&s;ical lady; and know that a &s;tring may be &s;trained, till it breaks. I am perfectly acquainted with the tenderne&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility of your nature; but you are not to judge of others, by your own fine feelings; or think your hu&s;band deficient in affection, if he is not &s;o minutely attentive to trifling circum|&s;tances,
<PB N="138" REF="138">
as your delicacy may prompt you to ex|pect.</P>
<P><HI>LES petits &s;oins</HI> belong mo&s;t properly to female life: the great cares of the world are load &s;uffi|cient for the able&s;t man. I have now done chid|ing I hope for ever, as I never can he angry with my Emily, but when &s;he wounds her&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE de&s;cription of your rural entertainment, plea&s;ed me much.&mdash;Whenever I go to Wood|fort, you &s;hall take me to &s;ee your <HI>pocket Arcadia</HI>&mdash;No, upon &s;econd thoughts, the &s;cene would he incomplete without a &s;wain; I therefore de|&s;ire you will pre&s;ent my compliments to Sir James Thornton, and tell him, that I appoint him my <HI>Ceci&s;beo</HI> for that party, if we &s;hould ever happen to meet at your hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I AM not at all &s;orry that lord Seymour has left you.&mdash;The con&s;tant angui&s;h which he mu&s;t ever feel, was &s;ufficient to infect you all. This naturally leads me to the charming nun. I can|not forgive your want of ingenuou&s;ne&s;s, in not mentioning the million of tears, her &s;tory mu&s;t have co&s;t you&mdash;there never was any thing more affecting.&mdash;Lucy and I read and wept by turns&mdash;When one of us began to faulter, the other en|deavoured to relieve her; but there were many pa&s;&s;ages that neither of us could repeat aloud, and only gazed &s;ilently on through the dim me|dium of our tears.</P>
<P>IT really requires a perfect certainty of the facts, to &s;uppo&s;e there ever were &s;uch mon&s;ters in nature as the general, and madame de Beau|mont. But Charlotte's unhappy fate is but too &s;trong a voucher of their inhumanity. Yet mi|&s;erable as the lovely ve&s;tal is, I think lord Sey|mour much more wretched.&mdash;Time, devotion, and a thorough con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the rectitude of all her actions, may calm her &s;orrows; whil&s;t
<PB N="139" REF="139">
his mu&s;t for ever be aggravated, by knowing that he has rendered her unhappy. I think him truly to be pitied. Adieu, my Emily.&mdash;Loves and good wi&s;hes from all here, accompany this to Woodfort.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>Lady</HI> WOODVILLE, to <HI>Lady</HI> STRAFFON.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE at pre&s;ent, a hou&s;e full of company; and therefore mu&s;t content my&s;elf with barely acknowledging the receipt of my dear Fanny's friendly admonitions, which I frankly admit to be ju&s;t, though I feel they are &s;evere. Call me no more a &s;poiled child, when I &s;o readily embrace the rod.</P>
<P>LADY Law&s;on has been here the&s;e three days. There have been odd reports about Sir William, and the young lady I formerly mentioned to you, who went to London, a few days before him. But I am per&s;uaded they are fal&s;e; for on Sir William's return la&s;t night, lady Law&s;on received him with the mo&s;t genuine and unaffected delight, that could be expre&s;&s;ed in looks or words; and I hear that mi&s;s Fanning (that is the lady's name) is to return to Law&s;on-Hall in a few days. The knight appeared a little embarra&s;&s;ed; but that might be owing to the meeting his lady in &s;o much company: we were all a&s;&s;embled at tea, and knew nothing of his return.</P>
<P>YOU mu&s;t not expect me to be a con&s;tant cor|re&s;pondent from York: the fatigue of dre&s;&s;ing twice, nay perhaps thrice a day, will afford me but little time for more rational entertainment.
<PB N="140" REF="140">
There are no moments which I think &s;o totally lo&s;t, as tho&s;e &s;pent at the toilette; but the cu&s;|toms of whatever place we are in, mu&s;t be com|plied with. Your Emily has not re&s;olution &s;uf|ficient to &s;tem a torrent, and mu&s;t therefore al|ways be carried away with the &s;tream. I will however, keep a &s;ort of journal of the occurren|ces of each day, and you mu&s;t accept of that, in lieu of my letters.</P>
<P>MY rea&s;on for not avowing how much I was affected, by the &s;tory of the nun, was to avoid taking off that &s;urprize, which gives &s;trength to every emotion.&mdash;When we are told that a trage|dy is extremely tragical, we &s;ummon our re&s;o|lution to oppo&s;e the feelings of our hearts; and frequently &s;uffer our pride to conquer its mo&s;t graceful weakne&s;s: whereas, when we are taken by &s;urprize, we give nature fair play, and do not attempt to combat with our humanity.</P>

<P>I OUGHT, perhaps to be more thankful to my dear Emily for her la&s;t &s;hort letter, than for any other &s;he has written to me. There is certainly the highe&s;t degree of merit, in giving plea&s;ure to others, when the effort is attended with trouble or difficulty to our&s;elves. The be|&s;towing a quarter of an hour upon an ab&s;ent friend, while we are &s;urrounded with the chear|ful
<PB REF="141">
gaiety of pre&s;ent ones, &s;hould always be con|&s;idered as an high compliment.</P>
<P>YOU may &s;ee by this remark, that I &s;et a proper value upon your kind attention; but I am &s;till more charmed with your conde&s;cen&s;ion, in admitting the ju&s;tne&s;s of my arguments. Believe me, my dear, if we wi&s;h to be happy, we mu&s;t make it a con&s;tant rule to turn awy our eyes, even from the minute&s;t failings of tho&s;e we love; the &s;uffering our thoughts to dwell long upon them, mu&s;t in&s;en&s;ibly le&s;&s;en our affection, and of cour&s;e our felicity.</P>
<P>THERE cannot in my mind be a more pitiable object, than a virtuous woman, who cea&s;es to love her hu&s;band.&mdash;What a dreadful vacuity mu&s;t &s;he feel in her heart! How coldly and in&s;ipidly mu&s;t her life pa&s;s away, who is merely actuated by duty, unanimated by love!</P>
<P>WHERE there never has been pa&s;&s;ion, there may for aught I know, be a kind of mixed &s;en|&s;ation compounded of e&s;teem, and mutual inte|re&s;t that &s;upplies the place of affection, to the in&s;en&s;ible part of mankind.&mdash;If this were not the ca&s;e, the generality of married people could not live &s;o well together as they do.&mdash;But this wretched &s;ub&s;titute, will never an&s;wer to a man or woman, who has once truly loved.</P>
<P>I WOULD therefore mo&s;t earne&s;tly recommend it to all tho&s;e, who are &s;o happy as to be united to the object of their choice, to &s;et the merits and attractions of each other, in the faire&s;t point of view to them&s;elves, and never, even for a moment, to ca&s;t their eyes on <HI>the wrong &s;ide of the tape&s;try.</HI></P>
<P>YOUR account of the kindne&s;s, with which lady Law&s;on received her wandering &s;wain, very fully proves that &s;he is an excellent wife; but is by no means a refutation of the reports relative
<PB REF="142">
to him and mi&s;s Fanning. Your ignorance of the world and its ways, make &s;uch &s;cenes appear extraordinary to you.&mdash;But alas! they are too frequent to be wondered at, in &s;uch times as the&s;e.</P>
<P>I SHALL not, my dear Emily, in&s;i&s;t upon your writing from York, if it is inconvenient to you: but as Fanny We&s;ton tells Lucy, that you do not &s;et out from Woodfort this fortnight, every day of which I dare &s;ay, &s;he thinks a year; I may flatter my&s;elf with the hopes of hear|ing from you, perhaps more than once before you go.</P>
<P>THAT &s;urprize encrea&s;es our emotions, I rea|dily admit; but, as you had no rea&s;on to doubt the tenderne&s;s of Lucy's nature, or mine, you might have communicated your own &s;en&s;ations, without fear of abating ours.</P>
<P>SIR John is gone to London, for a &s;hort time; and Lucy and I are to &s;pend the days of his ab|&s;ence, not in retirement, as you might po&s;&s;ibly &s;uppo&s;e, but in di&s;charging a heavy debt of vi&s;its, which we owe to all the neighbourhood for five miles round. I think there are few &s;mall evils that torture us &s;o much, as what is generally called a good neighbourhood in the country.</P>
<P>ADIEU, my dear Emily. I feel my&s;elf pee|vi&s;h, at the idea of &s;quandering my time, with per&s;ons that I have not the lea&s;t wi&s;h to conver&s;e with, and a&s;king &s;imple que&s;tions without the &s;malle&s;t de&s;ire to be informed. But as the world is con&s;tituted, we mu&s;t compound for &s;pending &s;ome part of our lives di&s;agreeably, and endea|vour to make our&s;elves what amends we can, by enjoying that portion of it which is left to our own di&s;po&s;al.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>Lady</HI> WOODVILLE, to <HI>Lady</HI> STRAFFON.</HEAD>
<P>MY dear Fanny is extremely kind, in &s;eem|ing to &s;et &s;o high a value upon my &s;mall, or rather no merit, in writing to her; for indeed I can never claim any, for what is to me the highe&s;t &s;elf indulgence.&mdash;So a truce with your compliments, my too civil &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>DO not be angry, Fanny; but I really cannot think with you, that true affection &s;hould be founded on illu&s;ion, which mu&s;t be the ca&s;e, if we are to be totally blind to the failings of tho&s;e we love.&mdash;On the contrary, I have always con&s;i|dered the rai&s;ing our ideas, of the per&s;ons we are to be united to, too romantically high, as one great &s;ource of matrimonial unhappine&s;s. By that means we became enamoured of a being, which exi&s;ts not in nature, and feel our&s;elves mortified and di&s;plea&s;ed as at a real di&s;appointment, when we di&s;cover that our imagination has exceeded the bounds of po&s;&s;ibility.</P>
<P>BUT if ab&s;olute perfection were to be found on earth, it would wound our &s;elf-love; and whatever injures that, can never be long dear to us. In the imperfections of our mo&s;t amiable friends, we find a con&s;olation for our own, which forbids de&s;pair, and places the generality of man|kind pretty nearly upon a level. This equally creates confidence, and that naturally produces e&s;teem and love.</P>
<P><PB REF="144" MS="y">AS the&s;e are my real &s;entiments, I think I may venture to tell you, that I am very &s;orry I have never been able to di&s;cover one failing in my lord. I declare, Fanny, this is a humiliating &s;ituation, to a creature &s;o con&s;cious of a thou|&s;and weakne&s;&s;es as I am; in&s;tead of re&s;training me from &s;earching for his faults, I de&s;ire you will immediately provide me with a magnifying gla&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in the di&s;covering them.</P>
<P>WHAT an horrid idea have you conjured up of a woman who cea&s;es to love her hu&s;band! There can be but two cau&s;es in nature that are capable of producing &s;uch an effect&mdash;for I talk not of tho&s;e animals who never felt pa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;The fir&s;t of the&s;e mu&s;t be a con&s;tant &s;eries of ill treat|ment, which I &s;uppo&s;e may at length conquer the tendere&s;t affection; and the unhappy &s;uffer|er who continues to act up to her duty, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, de&s;erves, in my mind, a much higher fame than any Greek or Roman, that ever yet exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>THE other cau&s;e mu&s;t be owing to a &s;hameful and vicious depravity of heart, commonly called incon&s;tancy; which to the honour of our &s;ex, I think I may &s;ay, is not frequent among&s;t us. But when this happens to be the ca&s;e, there is generally &s;ome new object in view; for that de&s;picable wretch,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a woman of gallantry never changes her fir&s;t love, till &s;he is engaged in a &s;econd."</Q></P>
<P>I THANK heaven for my ignorance of the world, and its ways, as I hope and believe, I &s;hall never have any trial, that may render a know|ledge of them nece&s;&s;ary. I know not what to think, with regard to lady Law&s;on; but for my own ea&s;e I will hope the be&s;t, as it is impo&s;&s;ible
<PB N="145" REF="145">
that I &s;hould be indifferent to any thing that di&s;|tre&s;&s;es her.</P>
<P>SIR James Thornton has had an ugly fall from his hor&s;e, and &s;trained his right arm, but has not received any dangerous hurt, though he is con|fined to his chamber. Lady Harriet, and Fanny We&s;ton are indefatigable in their attendance on him. I ju&s;t now received a me&s;&s;age from him, to inquire my health; which &s;eems a kind of tacit reproach, for not having been to vi&s;it him&mdash;My &s;i&s;ter Law&s;on and I &s;pent all this morning in de&s;igning plans for a wood-hou&s;e;&mdash;but as we are neither of us partial to our own inventions, we have laid them by, and determined to be rather good copyi&s;ts than bad originals.

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear EMILY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I am perfectly convinced that in the ac|count of our corre&s;pondence I am much your debtor, on the article of the entertainment, I am plea&s;ed at having a little adventure to relate to you, though I cannot hope that the
<PB N="146" REF="146">
recital will afford you as much plea&s;ure as the action gave me; but you mu&s;t make the &s;ame allowance as you do for a play in your clo&s;et, and furni&s;h out all the &s;cenery, decorations, &amp;c. from the &s;tore-hou&s;e of your own imagination.</P>
<P>MY tale runs &s;imply thus&mdash;As Lucy and I were returning home la&s;t night, from lady Vaughan's about eight o'clock, the &s;ky quite dark and rainy, one of the hind wheels of our carriage flew off; but as we were travelling at a very &s;low pace, in a miry road, we received no hurt from the accident&mdash;We were about three miles from Straffon Hill, which was rather too far for us to walk, as we were by no means ac|coutred for Peripatetics; and ju&s;t as ill qualified for an eque&s;trian expedition; we therefore &s;ent off the po&s;tilion on one of the hor&s;es, to bring the coach to us&mdash;</P>
<P>WE &s;aw no friendly cottage near; but at the di&s;tance of a quarter of a mile in the fields, which &s;eemed to us bright
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"as the Arcadian &s;tar, or Tyran Cyno&s;ure."</Q>
one of the &s;ervants di&s;|covered a path, that &s;eemed to lead to the man|&s;ion, from whence the&s;e charming beams had i&s;&s;ued.</P>
<P>WE took him with us, and &s;etting forward, &s;oon reached the &s;mall but ho&s;pitable dwelling. When we knocked at the door, a little neat coun|try girl appeared, and after conducting us into a &s;mall parlour, &s;aid &s;he would acquaint her young lady, that there were &s;trangers there, but that her mi&s;tre&s;s was at her devotions. We announced our&s;elves to the girl, and &s;he retired.</P>
<P>I WAS &s;urprized at this young creature's mode of expre&s;&s;ion; &s;he &s;eemed greatly amazed at our appearance, but her a&s;toni&s;hment could only be di&s;covered by her looks. In a few minutes an elegant young woman about eighteen, entered
<PB N="147" REF="147">
the room, and after &s;aluting us very gracefully, inquired to what happy accident &s;he was indebted for the honour of our vi&s;it?</P>
<P>THE courtline&s;s of her addre&s;s, and the ea&s;e of her manners, were all new &s;ubjects of won|der, both to Lucy and me; which we could not help expre&s;&s;ing, after we had informed her of the accident we had met with. She very politely offered us tea or coffee&mdash;we declined both&mdash;but there was a mch higher treat in her power, name|ly the gratification of our curio&s;ity, which we could not however venture to propo&s;e.</P>
<P>WHEN we had &s;at about a quarter of an hour, the little &s;ervant came in, and &s;aid her lady was come out of the chapel, and would be glad to &s;ee us&mdash;we were immediately &s;hewn into a room, the neatne&s;s and elegance of which it is impo&s;&s;i|ble to de&s;cribe; at the upper end of it, on a &s;mall &s;ofa, &s;at a woman with the fine&s;t form, though pale and emaciated, that can be imagined.</P>
<P>SHE ro&s;e to receive us, with &s;uch an affable dignity, as at once attracted our re&s;pect and love; &s;he was dre&s;&s;ed in black, and appeared to be about five and thirty&mdash;though &s;he &s;poke per|fect good Engli&s;h, there was ju&s;t &s;o much of the foreign accent in her utterance, as mu&s;t prevent your taking her for a native of this country.</P>
<P>OVER the chimney of the chamber we &s;at in, was a picture of a very hand&s;ome young man, and at the other end of the room, there hung one of the lady before us, in all the bloom of beauty, with her daughter, then about four years old by her &s;ide, and a boy that looked like a che|rubim, &s;eated in her lap.</P>
<P>AS I gazed on every object round me, with looks of admiration, which the lady of the hou&s;e could not help ob&s;erving, &s;he turned to me with an engaging &s;mile, and &s;aid, the &s;urprize which
<PB N="148" REF="148">
your lady&s;hip is too polite to expre&s;s in words, is &s;o porfectly vi&s;ible in your countenance, that it would appear like affectation to &s;eem in&s;en&s;ible of it; and as there is no part, either of my pa&s;t or pre&s;ent life, that &s;hould cau&s;e a blu&s;h to grow upon my cheek, I am ready to gratify that curio&s;ity, which the extraordinarine&s;s of my &s;ituation, &s;eems to have rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>IT will probably be near an hour, continued &s;he, before your carriage can arrive, and a much le&s;s time will &s;erve to relate the few, though un|common events, that have placed me in the cir|cum&s;tances you now &s;ee me. Both Lucy and I ex|pre&s;&s;ed our gratitude for &s;uch an obliging offer, in the warme&s;t terms, and intreated &s;he would pro|ceed&mdash;without more ceremony &s;he began.</P>
<P>I AM a native of Italy, and de&s;cended from one of the mo&s;t ancient families, of the repub|lic of Genoa&mdash;About twenty years ago, I be|came acquainted with a young Engli&s;h nobleman, called lord Somerville, who&s;e picture you &s;ee there (pointing her beautiful hand towards the chimney; he was then upon his travels, and under age.&mdash;He became pa&s;&s;ionately in love with me, and &s;oon in&s;pired me with more than grati|tude; with hone&s;t heart felt love.</P>
<P>WITH my permi&s;&s;ion, he applied to my fa|ther, for his con&s;ent to our marriage; well knowing that he could have no exception to his birth or fortune. We had not the lea&s;t appre|hen&s;ion of my father's refu&s;al&mdash;but we had both forgot that my lover was an <HI>heretic.</HI> This was deemed by him &s;o material an objection to our union, that he declared he would confine me to a convent for life, rather than hazard my &s;alva|tion by &s;uch a marriage.&mdash;My lover was forbid|den to repeat his vi&s;its, and I was &s;ent about twenty leagues off, into the country.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="149">LORD Somerville &s;oon di&s;covered my retreat, and got acce&s;s to me, by the treachery or zeal of a &s;ervant, who was intru&s;ted with the care of me. My father was informed of our interviews, and determined to &s;end me directly to a convent at Naple's, where an aunt of my mother's was lady abbe&s;s. A particular accident let me into the &s;ecret of my intended doom, and I no longer he&s;itated to prefer love and liberty, to cruelty and confinement. After lord Somerville had given me the mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;urances, that I &s;hould pre&s;erve my religion inviolate, <HI>we</HI> were married, and &s;et out privately in a felucca, hi|red for the purpo&s;e, which conveyed us both to Mar&s;eilles.</P>
<P>WHEN we came to Lyons, we were obliged to wait there for remittances from England, be|fore we could proceed farther. After having long expected them in vain, my lord received a very &s;evere and angry letter from his father, accu&s;ing him with having &s;tolen the daughter of an Italian nobleman, and commanding him to re&s;tore me to my parents, and return imme|diately to England.</P>
<P>THE di&s;tre&s;s of my hu&s;band's mind, upon this occa&s;ion, was not to be concealed; but it was a long time before he acquainted me with the real motives of his concern. Fondly and pa&s;&s;ionately as I loved him, I would have torn my&s;elf from his arms, and gone into a convent till his father's re&s;entment might have been ap|pea&s;ed, if my condition would have permitted it.</P>
<P>BUT I was then far gone with child, of that young lady before you, and he in the tendere&s;t manner, a&s;&s;ured me that not even the com|mands of a father, &s;hould have power to force him from me, till he had the happine&s;s of being
<PB N="150" REF="150">
him&s;elf a parent, and of &s;eeing me in a &s;ituation to &s;upport his ab&s;ence, or able to travel with him.</P>
<P>WE had lived in the utmo&s;t retirement, and privacy from the time of our arrival at Lyon's&mdash;My lord had taken the name of Forte&s;cue, and no creature, except his banker, knew who he was&mdash;We were &s;o perfectly happy in each other, that we wi&s;hed for no other &s;ociety&mdash;my lord amu&s;ed him&s;elf with teaching me Engli&s;h&mdash;with &s;uch a tutor, I &s;oon became a con&s;iderable proficient; and at the time that my Laura was born, I could read and perfectly under&s;tand the mo&s;t difficult Engli&s;h author's.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as I was quite recovered, we &s;et out for Paris, where my lord purpo&s;ed leaving me, while he went over to England to pay his duty to his father, and to endavour to reconcile him to our marriage. I will not take up your time, with attempting to de&s;cribe our mutual &s;ufferings at our &s;eparation; &s;uch forms as yours, mu&s;t have feeling hearts, and you can judge better than I de&s;cribe what we endured.</P>
<P>MY Lord remained above a year in England, making repeated but fruitle&s;s efforts, to conquer his father's re&s;entment, again&s;t a per&s;on who had never in thought offended him; but, alas! my being a catholic, was as unpardonable a crime to him, as my dear hu&s;band's being a prote&s;tant was to my father. Strange! that the wor&s;hippers of one God, and Saviour, who&s;e doctrine was peace and good will to men, &s;hould feel &s;uch enmity and hatred to each other!</P>
<P>AT my lord's return to France, I could not help perceiving a vi&s;ible change, both in his health and &s;pirits, though his fondne&s;s for me was un|dimini&s;hed; or if po&s;&s;ible, &s;eemed to be increa&s;|ed, by his tenderne&s;s for his daughter, who was then near two years old. As my lord concealed
<PB N="151" REF="151">
great part of his father's unrea&s;onable aver&s;ion to me, I was not without hopes that time would conquer his prejudices; which indeed I only wi&s;h|ed upon my lord's account; for while I enjoyed the real happine&s;s of his company, there was not a de&s;ire of my heart ungratified.</P>
<P>IN le&s;s than a year, that infant who&s;e portrait you &s;ee there, was born.&mdash;From the time of his birth my lord's health and &s;pirits &s;eemed to re|vive, and I then certainly reached the zenith of human felicity; alas! how quickly did the wheel turn round, to lay me in the lowe&s;t &s;tate of mi&s;e|ry? With what rapture have I &s;een him catch the infant in his arms, and &s;ay, this boy, this boy, my love, will plead our cau&s;e with my ob|durate father, and &s;often his hard heart? Would he were three years old!&mdash;but that ble&s;&s;ed time will come, and we &s;hall all be happy.&mdash;</P>
<P>WHILE lady Somerville repeated the forego|ing words, her countenance became more ani|mated, than it is po&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe; but a &s;udden gu&s;h of tears &s;oon dimmed the brilliant lu&s;tre of her eyes, and quenched the glowing crim&s;on on her cheek. She ro&s;e, and opening a &s;mall fold|ing door, retired into the chapel.</P>
<P>THE young lady &s;ympathized mo&s;t &s;incerely, with her mother's &s;orrow; and Lucy, and I who were extremely affected, were &s;carcely ca|pable of making proper apologies, for having been the innocent cau&s;e of renewing both the ladies afflictions. Mi&s;s Somerville &s;aid every thing that politene&s;s could dictate, to make us ea&s;y; and in a few minutes, lady Somerville re|turned with &s;uch an air of calmne&s;s and re&s;igna|nation as amazed me.</P>
<P>I TOOK the liberty of entreating that &s;he would not proceed farther in her &s;tory, for the pre&s;ent. But as I could not avoid being extreme|ly
<PB N="152" REF="152">
anxious about every circum&s;tance relative to &s;o amiable a per&s;on, I reque&s;ted &s;he would permit me to wait upon her, the next day, or when ever it was mo&s;t agreeable to her inclination.</P>
<P>SHE told me &s;he was very &s;en&s;ible of the de|licacy and propriety of my reque&s;t, which &s;he readily a&s;&s;ented to, as it promi&s;ed her the happi|ne&s;s of another interview with per&s;ons, for who&s;e &s;en&s;ibility and politene&s;s, &s;he had conceived the highe&s;t re&s;pect: &s;aid &s;he was a little a&s;hamed, that her long acquaintance with grief, had not yet rendered her &s;o familiar with it, as &s;he might naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed to be; but hoped we would excu&s;e the &s;udden emotion, which had for a few minutes tran&s;ported her. She then intreated our company to drink tea, the next evening, and &s;aid &s;he would, if po&s;&s;ible, be more compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>IN about a quarter of an hour the coach ar|rived, and we took leave of this charming un|fortunate, with the mo&s;t earne&s;t de&s;ire to renew our vi&s;it, and the warme&s;t hopes of being &s;er|viceable to her and her daughter.</P>
<P>I AM really fatigued with this long letter; but I would not &s;uffer oblivious &s;leep to &s;teal any part of this axtraordinary adventure from my memory, till I had communicated it to my dear Emily. By next po&s;t, you &s;hall have the re|mainder of the &s;tory; till then and ever,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>Lady</HI> STRAFFON, <HI>to Lady</HI> WOODVILLE.</HEAD>
<P>LUCY and I &s;et out immediately after dinner ye&s;terday, and reached lady Somerville's elegant cottage before five o'clock. As we ap|proached it by day-light, we di&s;covered many beauties that had been hidden from us by the dun &s;hades of night; particularly &s;everal &s;mall clumps of trees, that were encircled with wood|bines, orange and lemon gourds, and intermixed with a great variety of flowering &s;hrubs:&mdash;a &s;mall, but neat garden, at the bottom of which ran a rivulet &s;o clear, and &s;parkling, as to appear like liquid diamonds.</P>
<P>AS we drove by the pales of the garden, we perceived a building in it, that &s;eemed to be fitted up for a gardener's hou&s;e; and to our great a&s;toni&s;hment, beheld a man of a very re&s;pecta|ble appearance, about &s;ixty years of age, &s;eated in an arbour, with a book in his hand. We were received by both the ladies, with the &s;ame polite|ne&s;s and affability, as the day before. The fold|ing doors which led to the chapel &s;tood open: and indeed, Emily, there is no de&s;cribing the elegance, with which the alter is adorned.</P>
<P>I AM an enemy to all devotional parade: yet I could not help con&s;idering the decorations of this &s;acred &s;pot, rather as the offerings of the heart to heaven, than a &s;acrifice to vanity, as all the ornaments that are placed there, were the work of lady Somervill's and her daughters hands.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as tea and coffee were removed, lady Somerville, without waiting to be intreated, pro|ceeded in her narrative, thus&mdash;When I mention|ed
<PB N="154" REF="154">
my having reach<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the pinnacle of human fe|licity, I forgot to inform you, that my father had been reconciled to me, for &s;ome time; and on the birth of my &s;on, had pre&s;ented me with his picture &s;et with diamonds and de&s;ired the portrait of my lord, and tho&s;e of my chil|dren.</P>
<P>BUT before this reque&s;t could be complied with, I had the misfortune to lo&s;e my only parent.&mdash;His death was &s;udden, and he died without a will. This was the fir&s;t real affliction I had ever known; and my lord, in order to divert my me|lancholy, propo&s;ed our going to the &s;outh of France.</P>
<P>I ACQUIESCED in his de&s;ire on his account, more than my own; for as his con&s;titution was become extremely delicate, I hoped the change of air, might be of &s;ervice to him. We lived at Mantauban for near two years, during which time I had the con&s;tant angui&s;h of beholding my dear hu&s;band's health decline daily.</P>
<P>AS he was perfectly &s;en&s;ible of his own &s;itua|tion, he determined to take his little family to England, and pre&s;ent his &s;on to his unkind father. Every thing was fixed for our departure, when Providence, to who&s;e all-wi&s;e decrees I bow my|&s;elf beneath the du&s;t, thought proper to recall the trea&s;ure he had lent us, and took my little cherubim, to join the heavenly choir!</P>
<P>NO words can expre&s;s the affliction of my loved lord, nor de&s;cribe the wretched &s;tate both of his mind and his body. Whole days he hung enamoured over the pale beauteous clay that was his child, nor would he be prevailed upon to re|&s;ign it to corruption, till weakne&s;s left him not the power of oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>FROM that time he &s;unk into a &s;tate, nearly approaching to in&s;en&s;ibility, towards every thing
<PB N="155" REF="155">
except my&s;elf; but to his late&s;t moment his tenderne&s;s for me was undimini&s;hed. Why &s;hould I dwell longer upon a &s;cene, which but to think of, now &s;trains every nerve, and makes the blood run backward to its &s;ource! My mi&s;ery was completed by his death, in le&s;s than &s;ix weeks after that of my lovely boy!</P>
<Q><L>" <HI>But I will &s;tay my &s;orrows! will forbid</HI></L>
<L>" <HI>My eyes to &s;tream before thee, and my heart,</HI></L>
<L>" <HI>Thus full of angui&s;h, will from &s;ighs re&s;train!</HI></L>
<L>" <HI>For why &s;hould thy humanity be grieved</HI></L>
<L>" <HI>With my di&s;tre&s;s, and learn from me to mourn</HI></L>
<L>" <HI>The lot of nature doomed to care and pain!</HI>"</L></Q>
<P>YOU may &s;uppo&s;e that lady Somerville was for &s;ome time deprived of &s;peech; nor was there one of us capable of interrupting the melancholy &s;ilence, but by our &s;ighs. She however &s;oon dried her tears, and re&s;umed her di&s;cour&s;e.&mdash;I &s;hall relate the re&s;t of my &s;tory, &s;aid &s;he, though to|tally unintere&s;ting to my&s;elf, as it will account for my pre&s;ent &s;ituation.</P>
<P>I WAS about four months gone with child, at the time of my lords illne&s;s; and his la&s;t reque&s;t to me was, that I would if po&s;&s;ible, lye-in in England, and acquaint his father with my preg|nancy, as &s;oon as I arrived there. He told me that if the child I carried &s;hould be a &s;on, it would inherit the fortune and honours of his family; but if not, that there was no provi&s;ion made for me, or any daughters I might have, as he was under age, at the time he married; and that the e&s;tate was intailed upon a very di&s;tant re|lation. He implored me to pre&s;erve my life, for the &s;ake of the poor Laura; and to throw my&s;elf and her into his father's protection.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="156">AS it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible that I &s;hould give you an adequate idea of my &s;ituation, at that time, I will not attempt it; but endeavour to ca&s;t a veil over that &s;cene of di&s;tre&s;s, which no pen, no pencil, can ever be able to de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>I SET out from Montauban, with my maid, my chaplain, and my child, and arrived &s;afe in London. I obeyed my dear lord's reque&s;t, and wrote immediately to his father. His lord&s;hip was then in the country. He an&s;wered my letter with great civility, mixed with an affectation of kindne&s;s: &s;aid he &s;hould be in town &s;hortly, that he would then &s;ee me, and de&s;ired I would take care of my&s;elf for the &s;ake of the unborn babe, which he hoped would prove a &s;on and heir.</P>
<P>IN a few days after I had received this letter, I was informed that there were per&s;ons appointed to attend me, till I was brought to bed, le&s;t I &s;hould impo&s;e a &s;urreptitious child upon the fa|mily. I knew not that &s;uch proceedings were u&s;ual in my ca&s;e, and I wrote a letter to my father-in-law, complaining of &s;uch treatment, to which he never deigned a reply.</P>
<P>BUT all their apprehen&s;ions on my account, were &s;oon over: I was delivered, in the &s;eventh month, of a dead &s;on; and from that time I heard nothing farther from my lord's father, or any of his family, for above &s;ix months. The little money I had brought with me into Egland, was now quite exhau&s;ted; and I was obliged to apply, heaven knows how unwillingly! to this inhuman parent, for &s;ome means of &s;upport, for his &s;on's widow, and grandchild.</P>
<P>IN his reply to my letter, he told me what I knew before, that neither my daughter nor I were entitled to any thing by law; that therefore he advi&s;ed me to go back to my own country; and he would furni&s;h me with money to carry
<PB N="157" REF="157">
me there, provided I would leave Laura in Eng|land, to his care. That if I &s;hould refu&s;e the&s;e terms, I mu&s;t even provide for my&s;elf as it was not his purpo&s;e to offer me any others.</P>
<P>WHEN the mind has been once totally &s;ubdu|ed by &s;orrow, we flatter our&s;elves, that we are incapable of being wounded by any new di&s;tre&s;s: but the idea of being torn from the dear remains of my loved lord, my only child, convinced me that there were &s;till &s;ome arrows in the quiver of adver&s;ity, that had not yet been pointed at my peace.</P>
<P>I DID not he&s;itate one moment, to determine that no con&s;ideration &s;hould make me con&s;ent to a &s;eparation, from all that was now dear to me on earth. I mu&s;t, indeed, have been ab&s;olutely void of humanity as him&s;elf, if I could have re|&s;igned my child into the hands of a man, who had neve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> even de&s;ired to &s;ee her before.</P>
<P>I WROTE immediately to my brothers at Genoa, and acquainted them with my di&s;tre&s;s. They very kindly a&s;&s;ured me, that they would receive me and my daughter, with open arms at our return; but if it &s;hould be my choice to re|main in England, they would take care that I &s;hould not want a &s;upport there. They immedi|ately remitted me bills for a thou&s;and <HI>pia&s;ters,</HI> and agreed to &s;ettle the &s;ame &s;um annually upon me, or more if I &s;hould have occa&s;ion for it.</P>
<P>AT this in&s;tance of genero&s;ity and affection, my heart once more became expanded with gra|titude to the Almighty, and with true &s;i&s;terly tenderne&s;s to my benefactors. I now began to make the fir&s;t efforts towards &s;ubduing the vio|lence of my grief, and to be &s;en&s;ible that I might have been rendered &s;till more wretched than I was, by the deprivation of my child, or our be|ing reduced to &s;lavery for bread.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="158">I SOON fixed upon the plan of life which I meant to pur&s;ue, and &s;ent my worthy chap|lain and my faithful maid, in &s;earch of a retire|ment, &s;uch as you now &s;ee. In this &s;pot I have lived about eight years, in which time I have had no manner of conver&s;e with any human creature but my own family; which now con&s;i&s;ts of my daughter, my chaplain and my&s;elf; my gardener, his wife and the little maid, their daughter, whom your lady&s;hip has &s;een.</P>
<P>THE only additional misfortune I have known in this place was the lo&s;s of my faithful Maria: &s;he died about two years &s;ince; and as my daugh|ter was then of age not to need her attendance, I have never attempted to &s;upply her place.</P>
<P>RUSTICATED &s;o long as we have been, you will not I hope, ladies, be &s;urprized at the &s;im|plicity of mine or my daughter's manners.&mdash;Our &s;ituation is certainly a very extraordinary one, and mu&s;t naturally have rai&s;ed your curio&s;ity, which I have endeavoured to gratify by a plain and artle&s;s narrative.</P>
<P>I WISH for your &s;akes, as well as my own, that my &s;tory had been le&s;s affecting; but I &s;hall not make any apology for having drawn forth the lovely drop of &s;ympathetic &s;orrow, which glow|ed with brighter lu&s;tre on your cheeks than the mo&s;t co&s;tly brilliant.</P>
<P>BOTH Lucy and I poured forth our thanks, for her kindne&s;s and conde&s;cen&s;ion in relating her &s;tory; admired the con&s;tancy of her re&s;olution in remaining &s;o long in retirement, but &s;eemed to hope that &s;he might change her purpo&s;e. I &s;aw &s;he was di&s;plea&s;ed at &s;uch a hint; but with great politene&s;s, &s;aid it was the only &s;ubject &s;he did not wi&s;h to hear us talk upon, as it would always give her pain to di&s;&s;ent from our opinion, which
<PB N="159" REF="159">
&s;he mu&s;t ever do, both in word and deed, upon that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I THEN ventured to a&s;k her if &s;he wi&s;hed that mi&s;s Somerville &s;hould pa&s;s her life in &s;uch a &s;tate of &s;eclu&s;ion? She &s;aid by no means;&mdash;&s;o far from it, that &s;he &s;ent forth a thou&s;and fruit|le&s;s wi&s;hes, that &s;ome lucky accident might hap|pen to introduce her to per&s;ons of &s;en&s;e and vir|tue, and of a proper rank, to lead her gently in|to life; that &s;he had heard the characters of all the per&s;ons of fa&s;hion in that neighbourhood from her chaplain, who frequently mixed with the world in order to tran&s;act her affairs;&mdash;that as &s;he was above flattery, &s;he was al&s;o &s;uperior to di&s;gui&s;e, and frankly owned that her utmo&s;t wi&s;h in this world would be gratified, if lady Straffon would promi&s;e her protection to her dear orphan.</P>
<P>I SCARCE &s;uffered her to fini&s;h the latter part of her &s;peech before I flew to and embraced her, and with great truth a&s;&s;ured her, that my inclina|tions met hers, more than half way. I begged that from that moment &s;he would do me the ho|nour to con&s;ider me as her &s;i&s;ter, and that the lovely Laura might be henceforth deemed my niece.</P>
<P>EVERY thing that delicate gratitude could dic|tate was uttered upon this occa&s;ion; and we all appeared to be infinitely happier than we could have &s;uppo&s;ed it po&s;&s;ible for us to be in &s;o &s;hort a time, after having been &s;o very much afflicted.</P>
<P>LADY Somerville concluded with informing me, that her father-in-law had been dead about four-years, and had left mi&s;s Somerville &s;ix-thou|&s;and pounds. We agreed that Lucy &s;hould bring Laura to Straffon-Hill to-morrow; and I promi&s;|ed
<PB N="160" REF="160">
to convey her back to her lady&s;hip whenever &s;he required her attendance.</P>
<P>YOU cannot, my dear Emily, yes you can conceive the &s;incere plea&s;ure I feel at having it in my power to oblige the amiable and unfortu|nate lady Somerville. It mu&s;t certainly be an in|finite relief to her mind to know that her daugh|ter has a friend and protector, in ca&s;e Providence &s;hould be plea&s;ed to put a period to her woes and take her to his mercy. But &s;he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;uffer a great deal in being &s;eparated from her till u&s;e &s;hall have made it ea&s;y.</P>
<P>LAURA is but ju&s;t &s;eventeen, though &s;he looks rather older from the gravity and dignity of her appearance. I flatter my&s;elf you will receive &s;ome entertainment from this narrative, which I have been as exact in as my memory would per|mit; and indeed it has for the time &s;o intirely engro&s;&s;ed my attention, that I am pretty &s;ure I have not omitted a circum&s;tance of any con&s;e|quence.</P>
<P>I EXPECT Sir John will return from London the beginning of next week.&mdash;I hope he will be charmed with our young vi&s;itor; and that lady Somerville will &s;uffer him &s;ometimes to &s;pend an hour with her.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>Lady</HI> WOODVILLE to <HI>Lady</HI> STRAFFON.</HEAD>
<P>I MOST &s;incerely congratulate my dear Fanny upon the acqui&s;ition &s;he has made to her hap|pine&s;s, by her acquaintance with lady Somerville. There was &s;omething extremely romantic in the opening of your adventure, and I almo&s;t began to imagine that you had taken a trip to Fairy land; but every circum&s;tance, though &s;urpri&s;ing at fir&s;t, is very naturally accounted for in the cour&s;e of your narrative. I truly compa&s;&s;ionate the unhappy lady's &s;ituation; and again felicitate you on having it in your power to remove a very material part of her di&s;tre&s;s, by affording your friend&s;hip and protection to her daughter.</P>
<P>LADY Somerville's misfortunes are of the hopele&s;s kind; it is not in the power of fate to re&s;tore her hu&s;band, or her &s;on; and &s;light ob|&s;ervers would for the&s;e rea&s;ons, pronounce her much more wretched than tho&s;e who are led on by a faint glimp&s;e of hope to wander through the thorny paths of life in &s;earch of &s;ome imaginary bli&s;s, which &s;till cludes their gra&s;p. But I think otherwi&s;e. When the grave clo&s;es on our joys, our pro&s;pect of this world mu&s;t all end there; we can no more deceive our&s;elves, or be deceiv|ed. We &s;ink, it is true, and fall with the dear prop which fate has torn away. Then rea&s;on and religion come to our aid; and when the fir&s;t wild &s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ts of grief are over, an humble acquie&s;|cence; in the divine will &s;ooths our &s;ad &s;ouls to peace; or hopes &s;pring forward to another goal, and pierce beyond the &s;tars.</P>
<P>BUT while vain doubts and fears torment the heart, while pa&s;&s;ion has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;oul, and
<PB N="162" REF="162">
&s;till impels us forward through amaze, where our bewildered rea&s;on finds no clue, where peace is lo&s;t and keen di&s;quiet fills its vacant place; where our de&s;ires are rai&s;ed but to be mocked, and cruelty repaid for artle&s;s love!&mdash;Sure, &s;ure, this &s;tate is wor&s;e, far wor&s;e than lady So|merville's! She feels the &s;troke of death; but lady Harriet feels a living torture! inflicted too by whom her &s;oul adored.</P>
<P>I HAVE been led into this reflection by ob&s;erv|ing that lady Harriet's health and &s;pirits have de|clined vi&s;ibly, ever &s;ince her unlucky interview with captain Barnard; and I am certain that his almo&s;t perpetual re&s;idence at Ransford-Hall, in|crea&s;es her di&s;quiet. In his fir&s;t act of incon|&s;tancy, &s;he might with great rea&s;on imagine that fortune only had turned the &s;cale in favour of her rival, and &s;he had &s;till the melancholy con&s;olati|on of &s;uppo&s;ing her&s;elf beloved, though by a worthle&s;s man.</P>
<P>HIS pre&s;ent attachment can ari&s;e only from choice or galantry: and it is certainly much more difficult to bear contempt, than injury. Had he died at that time he left her in Paris, her grief for his lo&s;s would by this time have been &s;oftened into a gentle melancholy, which though it might for ever have barred her preten&s;ions to happine&s;s, would not have rendered her half &s;o wretched as &s;he is at this moment, and I fear will ever be.</P>
<P>LET not what I have &s;aid upon this &s;ubject make my dear Fanny think that I am not ex|tremely affected with lady Somerville's di&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;I acknowledge that her &s;ufferings have been great, but they certainly came to a period when her hu&s;band died; and time has, I doubt not, in&s;en&s;ibly le&s;&s;ened her affliction. I al&s;o hope that
<PB N="163" REF="163">
there is yet in re&s;erve for her, the felicity of &s;eeing her daughter amiable and happy.</P>
<P>ADIEU, my dear Fanny; my lord, and all this family &s;alute you and yours mo&s;t affection|ately. I de&s;ire you will pre&s;ent my re&s;pects to lady Somerville and her daughter, both of whom I hope to have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing when next I am &s;o happy as to vi&s;it Straffon-Hill.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear EMILY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM &s;o &s;incerely charmed at the hope of your prophecy in favour of lady Somerville being immediately accompli&s;hed, that I can neither think, &s;peak or write upon any other &s;ubject.&mdash;Sir John returned from London in two days after Laura had become our gue&s;t; &s;he and I were ju&s;t come back from paying an evening vi&s;it to lady Somerville, when he entered the drawing room, and introduced a young Italian nobleman, who had been recommended to him, by one of his mo&s;t intimate friends at Paris.</P>
<P>I NEVER beheld a hand&s;omer youth; tall graceful and finely made, with the &s;tronge&s;t ex|pre&s;&s;ion of &s;en&s;e and &s;weetne&s;s in his counte|nance&mdash;as he cannot &s;peak Engli&s;h our conver&s;a|tion was intirely Italian, in which, though Lucy and I are tolerable proficients, we were greatly excelled by Mi&s;s Somerville, who has had the advantage of conver&s;ing with her mother, in that charming language from her earlie&s;t infancy.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t two or three days that our young
<PB N="164" REF="164">
foreigner &s;pent with us, we imagined that his devoting the large&s;t &s;hare of his time and con|ver&s;ation to Laura was owing to the ea&s;y fluency with which &s;he &s;poke his native language; but his motives remained not long doubtful; he be|came very particular in his inquiries about her to Sir John, who gave him the fulle&s;t information of her birth and &s;ituation in life. He &s;eemed charmed at the account of both, and from that time his a&s;&s;iduity towards her appeared le&s;s em|barra&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>NOR is the gentle heart of Laura in&s;en&s;ible to his attentions; her blu&s;hes, when he is menti|oned, and down ca&s;t looks when he addre&s;&s;es her, plainly di&s;cover the &s;tate of her artle&s;s mind. She is really a very fine creature, Emily, and I am truly anxious for her happine&s;s. She has a &s;en&s;ibility, a frankne&s;s, a delicate ingen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ou&s;ne&s;s of nature, not to be found in tho&s;e who have had much commerce with the world, which &s;he owes to her &s;eque&s;tered education with a parent, who&s;e natural &s;oftne&s;s has been increa&s;ed by a long acquaintance with affliction.</P>
<P>BUT to the purpo&s;e&mdash;La&s;t night the enamour|ed Lodovico explained his &s;entiments to Sir John, and intreated him to prevail on me to introduce him to lady Somerville; though he confe&s;&s;ed that he found Laura extremely aver&s;e to a pro|po&s;al which mu&s;t for ever divide her from the tendere&s;t of mothers; but as &s;he &s;eemed to have no other objection, he flattered him&s;elf that this might be &s;urmounted.</P>
<P>SIR John's friend, lord Mount Willis, who recommended Lodovico to him, informed him that he is de&s;cended from one of the fir&s;t families at Genoa, that he is an only &s;on, intitled to a very large fortune, and &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;t of a much higher trea&s;ure.&mdash;an unexceptionable character.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="165">I NEEDED not much per&s;ua&s;ion, to enter upon &s;uch a plea&s;ing emba&s;&s;y.&mdash;I waited on lady So|merville this morning; &s;he &s;eemed a little alarm|ed at Laura's not being with me. I quickly re|moved her apprehen&s;ions, by explaining the cau&s;e of my vi&s;it. She heard me with the utmo&s;t attention, but could not help dropping &s;ome tears when I mentioned Laura's objection to quitting her.</P>
<P>LADY Straffon, &s;aid &s;he, when I had fini&s;hed my di&s;cour&s;s, though my girl's affection awakens all my tenderne&s;s for her, I will not &s;uffer her to &s;acrifice her welfare to my &s;elfi&s;h &s;atisfaction.&mdash;The world contains but one object for me; let her be happy, and contribute to the happine&s;s of a de&s;erving hu&s;band, and I &s;hall ta&s;te the only <HI>joy</HI> my heart is capable of. And &s;hould that long ab&s;ent <HI>gue&s;t</HI> ever deign to vi&s;it me again, it is to you the ble&s;&s;ed mini&s;ter of Providence, to whom I am indebted for its pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>I ENDEAVOURED to re&s;train the grateful effu|&s;ions of her generous heart, by a&s;&s;uring her that I felt almo&s;t as much plea&s;ure as even &s;he could be &s;en&s;ible of from the pro&s;pect of Laura's future happine&s;s.&mdash;We then agreed that I &s;hould bring Laura and Lodovico to wait upon her in the af|ternoon.&mdash;The in&s;tant I return I will acquaint you with the re&s;ult of our vi&s;it; till then,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>Lady</HI> STRAFFON, <HI>to Lady</HI> WOODVILLE.</HEAD>
<P>(In continuation.)</P>
<P>JOIN with me, my deare&s;t Emily, in rejoic|ing at the happine&s;s which opens to the view of our amiable friends. But I will not de|tain you from the events which create their pre|&s;ent joy. I carried my two young gue&s;ts, Laura and Lodovico, this afternoon to lady Somerville's cottage; &s;he received us with her u&s;ual grace and elegance: but when I pre&s;ented &s;ignior Lodovico to her, I fancied I perceived a change of countenance, which I knew not how to ac|count for. However &s;he pre&s;ently recovered her&s;elf, and continued to entertain us with the greate&s;t politene&s;s.</P>
<P>AFTER tea, I took Laura into the garden, under pretence of admiring a little grotto &s;he had lately fini&s;hed in order to give the young gentleman an opportunity of explaining his &s;enti|ments to her mother. We had not been ten mi|nutes ab&s;ent, when the little country maid came running to us, and de&s;ired we would return im|mediately.</P>
<P>WE were not a little &s;urprized at this &s;um|mons; but judge how our wonder was increa&s;ed on finding lady Sommerville with her eyes &s;tream|ing, and Lodovico &s;eated by her, with an air that &s;poke him a &s;harer in her emotions! The moment we entered the room, &s;he &s;tarted up, and taking her daughter's hand, come, &s;aid &s;he, come and embrace your cou&s;in, the &s;on of that friend, that more than brother, to whom we have been indebted for the means of life &s;o many years.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="167">POOR Laura was unable to &s;peak; but her eyes fully expre&s;&s;ed the tender and grateful &s;enti|ments of her heart. The enraptured Lodovico &s;eemed totally ab&s;orbed in the plea&s;ure of gazing on her.&mdash;After &s;ome time, lady Somerville turn|ing to me, &s;aid, You &s;ee before you, my dear lady Straffon, the only &s;on of count Mele&s;pini.&mdash;The in&s;tant I &s;aw him, I was &s;truck with the re&s;emblance of that much loved brother.&mdash;But how could I flatter my&s;elf with the happine&s;s of beholding his &s;on!</P>
<P>AND now, my dear children, continued &s;he, though my con&s;ent awaits ye, be a&s;&s;ured, that without the court's concurrence, this union ne|ver can take place; write to him therefore, Lo|dovico, and let both him and you re&s;t &s;atisfied, that his will &s;hall in this affair determine mine.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, I hope, &s;aid &s;he, your lady&s;hip will di&s;pen&s;e with Laura's attendance at Straffon-Hill. Perhaps my brother may have other views for his &s;on; if &s;o, it is be&s;t not to indulge an affection too far, which may be productive of unhappy con&s;equences: for, be a&s;&s;ured, that however de&s;erving the object, how|ever virtuous the attachment, no marriage can be truly ble&s;t, that pains a parent's heart.&mdash;A too energic &s;igh accompanied the&s;e words: but, ad|ded &s;he, when lady Straffon honours me with her company, I hope my nephew will attend her.</P>
<P>IT was very vi&s;ible that Lodovico complied reluctantly with the&s;e conditions; and perhaps Laura, for the fir&s;t time, found obedience diffi|cult.&mdash;But as her lady&s;hip &s;eemed determined, a bow of a&s;&s;ent was the only reply that was made. Signior Lodovico and I returned home, &s;oon af|ter this conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>BY the way he accounted to me for not know|ing
<PB N="168" REF="168">
that lady Somerville or Laura were related to him, as he had always heard them call State|villa, which is their name in Italian. I find he intends making as much u&s;e as po&s;&s;ible of the privilege of attending me to lady Somerville's; &s;o that I expect to pa&s;s much of my time at the cottage.</P>
<P>HE is now retired to acquaint his father with the happy di&s;covery he has made of his relations, and his &s;entiments towards his fair cou&s;in. I &s;hall be truly impatient for the count's an&s;wer.&mdash;I hope it will be favourable; if it &s;hould not, I fear all lady Somerville's precaution will be in|&s;ufficient to prevent the attachments of the young people, though I believe it would be impo&s;&s;ible to draw Laura from her obedience.</P>
<P>I HAVE been &s;o much engaged in the affairs of the Somerville family for the&s;e two days, that I have &s;carce had lei&s;ure to think of my own.&mdash;You may therefore excu&s;e my not entering upon the critical di&s;tinctions you have made on the various modes of mi&s;ery in your la&s;t letter. I heartily wi&s;h you would take the oppo&s;ite ex|treme for your &s;ubject, and de&s;cant on your own happine&s;s; which I believe to be as perfect as this frail &s;tate will admit of. May it long con|tinue &s;o, &s;incerely wi&s;hes,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your affectionate F. STRAFFON.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
