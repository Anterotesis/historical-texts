<L>And let this Giant Sin, in the full eye</L>
<L>Of Ob&s;ervation, pa&s;s unwounded by?</L>
<L>Tho' our meek Wives, pa&s;&s;ive Obedience taught,</L>
<L>Patiently bear tho&s;e wrongs, for which They ought,</L>
<L>With the brave &s;pirit of their dams po&s;&s;e&s;s'd,</L>
<L>To plant a dagger in each hu&s;band's brea&s;t,</L>
<L>To cut off male increa&s;e from this fair I&s;le,</L>
<L>And turn our Thames into another Nile;</L>
<L>Tho', on his Sunday, the &s;mug PULPITEER,</L>
<L>Loud 'gain&s;t all other crimes, is &s;ilent here,</L>
<L><PB N="32" REF="33">
And thinks him&s;elf ab&s;olv'd, in the pretence</L>
<L>Of Decency, which meant for the defence</L>
<L>Of real Virtue, and to rai&s;e her price,</L>
<L>Becomes an agent for the cau&s;e of vice;</L>
<L>Tho' the Law &s;leeps, and, thro' the care They take</L>
<L>To drug her well, may never more awake;</L>
<L>Born in &s;uch times, nor with that patience cur&s;t</L>
<L>Which Saints may boa&s;t of, I mu&s;t &s;peak, or bur&s;t.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But if, too eager in my bold cariere,</L>
<L>Haply I wound the nice, and cha&s;ter ear,</L>
<L>If, all unguarded, all too rude, I &s;peak,</L>
<L>And call up blu&s;hes in the maiden's cheek,</L>
<L>Forgive, Ye Fair&mdash;my real motives view,</L>
<L>And to forgivene&s;s add your prai&s;es too.</L>
<L>For You I write&mdash;nor wi&s;h a better plan&mdash;</L>
<L>The Cau&s;e of Woman is mo&s;t worthy Man&mdash;</L>
<L>For You I &s;till will write, nor hold my hand,</L>
<L>Whil&s;t there's one &s;lave of SODOM in the land.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let them fly far, and &s;kulk from place to place,</L>
<L>Not daring to meet Manhood face to face,</L>
<L>Their &s;teps I'll track, nor yield them one retreat</L>
<L>Where They may hide their heads, or re&s;t their feet,</L>
<L><PB N="33" REF="34">
Till God in wrath &s;hall let his vengeance fall,</L>
<L>And make a great example of them all,</L>
<L>Bidding in one grand pile this Town expire,</L>
<L>Her Tow'rs in du&s;t, her Thames a lake of fire,</L>
<L>Or They (mo&s;t worth our wi&s;h) convinc'd, tho' late,</L>
<L>Of their pa&s;t crimes, and dangerous e&s;tate,</L>
<L>Pardon of Women with Repentance buy,</L>
