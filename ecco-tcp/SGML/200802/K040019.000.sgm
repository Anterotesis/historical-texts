<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore we come to give an Account of this our New Me|thod for the Di&s;covery of the Longitude, both by Sea and Land, which we here take leave humbly to propo&s;e to the Con&s;ideration of the Publick, we think it rea&s;onable to premi&s;e &s;omewhat by way of In|troduction: To give &s;ome Account of the Nature of the Problem before us; to &s;peak a little of the Methods hitherto try'd, and the Rea&s;ons of their ill Succe&s;s; and to add a brief Hi&s;torical Narration, from what Occa&s;ions and by what Steps this
<PB N="6" REF="5">
our Method was fir&s;t di&s;cover'd, and has arriv'd at its pre&s;ent Degree of Maturity.</P>
<P>As to the Problem it &s;elf, the In|vention of the Longitude; it is plain|ly this: To di&s;cover in &s;ome mea|&s;ure a like &s;ure way of frequently knowing, how far we are di&s;tant, on the Earth Spherical Surface, in Degrees, from any known Meridian, Ea&s;tward or We&s;tward; as we can ea&s;ily know, almo&s;t at any time, how far we are di&s;tant, in Degrees, on the &s;ame Surface, from the middle Circle or Equator, Northward or Southward. Now in this Ca&s;e it mu&s;t be noted, that as the Diurnal Motion does naturally imply fixed Poles, and a fixed Equator; which infer a different Meridian Altitude of tho&s;e Poles, and of that Equator, and by con&s;equence of all the hea|venly Bodies, in different Latitudes; which different Altitude may in clear Weather be ea&s;ily ob&s;erv'd by proper
<PB N="7" REF="6">
In&s;truments, and thereby that Lati|tude may be readily di&s;covered; &s;o does not the &s;ame Diurnal Motion at all imply any <HI>Phaenomena,</HI> whence the Longitude may be di&s;cover'd to us: Becau&s;e the &s;ame Parallel &s;till bears, through its whole Circumfe|rence, the &s;ame Relation to tho&s;e Poles and that Equator, without any Difference. The Diurnal Motion therefore, which affords an obvious Foundation for the Invention of the Latitude of every Place on the Earth, affords us no &s;uch Foundation for the Invention of the Longitude of the &s;ame Places. Nor is it therefore an ea&s;y Problem, either a&s;tronomical or practical to di&s;cover the &s;ame.</P>
<P>As to the Methods hitherto tryed, they are either Cele&s;tial, or Terre|&s;trial; and may be reduc'd to the&s;e Seven, Four that are <HI>Cele&s;tial,</HI> and Three that are <HI>Terre&s;trial.</HI><LIST>

<ITEM>(6) Clocks, or Watches.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(7) The Log Line or Dead Rec|koning.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The Eclip&s;es of the Moon are u&s;eful for the Longitude. For its Immer&s;ions into the Earths Shadow, its neare&s;t Di&s;tances to that Center, and its Emer&s;ions therefrom, are all at di&s;tinct and known Points of ab|&s;olute time. So that where and when they can be nicely ob&s;erv'd; and the Difference of the apparent times at every Meridian noted; the re&s;pective Longitudes of tho&s;e Pla|ces may be thereby found in time; and by allowing 15 Degrees of the Equator to an Hour, may be found in Degrees al&s;o.</P>
<P>Secondly, in the &s;ame manner may the Eclip&s;es of the Sun be made u&s;e of; e&s;pecially as now improv'd by our great A&s;tronomer Mr. <HI>Flam&s;teeds</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="8">
<HI>Con&s;truction</HI> of them; and as they will, we hope, be farther improv'd by Mr. <HI>Whi&s;tons</HI> actual <HI>Exhibition</HI> of them, in his In&s;trument, ju&s;t ready for Pub|lication. Which Method, by the Difference of the apparent time of any Part of the Eclip&s;e in different Places, gives the Difference of Me|ridians, or of Longitude in the like manner as before.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The Eclip&s;es of Jupiters Satellits afford another like Method for the Di&s;covery of the Longitude; and that on the &s;ame Foundation with tho&s;e of the Moon.</P>
<P>Fourthly, the Motion of the Moon, with its Di&s;tance from the Sun, or rather its Appul&s;e to and Occultation of tho&s;e fixed Stars that ly along its Cour&s;e, is another re|markable Method for this purpo&s;e; and is of the &s;ame Nature with the Eclip&s;es of the Sun as to this matter.</P>
<P>The&s;e Four may ju&s;tly be called <HI>Cele&s;tial,</HI> or <HI>A&s;tronomical</HI> Methods of
<PB N="10" REF="9">
di&s;covering the Longitude, becau&s;e they make u&s;e of the Cele&s;tial Bo|dies, or of the Stars in order to that End. The Three <HI>Terre&s;trial</HI> Me|thods are as follows.</P>
<P>5ly, The Variation of the Needle from the North is now, e&s;pecially &s;ince Dr. <HI>Halleys</HI> noble Ob&s;ervations and Map thereto relating, become one Method for the Di&s;covery of the Lon|gitude; particularly in tho&s;e Parts, where that Variation is be&s;t known, and the North and South Po&s;ition of its Lines are mo&s;t remarkable. For by cro&s;&s;ing the Meridians there, you al&s;o cro&s;s the Curves of equal Va|riation, and di&s;cover in &s;ome mea&s;ure your Longitude thereby.</P>
<P>Sixthly, The U&s;e of Clocks or Watches at Sea is another Method; and was attempted by the famous <HI>Hugenius.</HI> And indeed if they could be exactly kept to an even motion, and &s;o &s;hew the Hour at any one certain place at Land; the Com|pari&s;on
<PB N="11" REF="10">
of the Time known by that Clock or Watch, with the apparent time at the Ship known by the Sun or Stars, or another Clock or Watch regulated by them, would di&s;cover the Longitude from the Place to which that fir&s;t Clock or Watch was adju&s;ted, in time, and &s;o, as be|fore, in Degrees al&s;o.</P>
<P>Seventhly, The Log-line and Dead Reckning, when all fails, is the la&s;t Remedy in this ca&s;e; and from thence the Seamen gue&s;s, as well as they can, by the Angle and length of their Cour&s;e, what Longitude and Latitude they are in: And when by Ob&s;ervation they find their Er|ror in Latitude, they conclude up|on a proportionable one in Longi|tude al&s;o. And &s;o for want of a &s;ure Guide, either Cele&s;tial or Ter|re&s;tial, they are forc'd to depend on this; which yet is, as well as the re&s;t, very uncertain and inac|curate.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">
For to come to the Rea&s;ons of the &s;mall Succe&s;s of the&s;e &s;everal Methods.</P>
<P>As to the two fir&s;t, the Eclip&s;es of the Sun and Moon; to &s;ay nothing here of the &s;lowne&s;s of the Moon's Motion, which renders any great de|gree of exactne&s;s impo&s;&s;ible; or of the difficulty of Calculation and Con|&s;truction, e&s;pecially in the Sun's E|clip&s;es; and of Ob&s;ervations in both: The &s;ingle rarene&s;s of the&s;e Eclip&s;es, which is not &s;eldom made &s;till rarer by cloudy Weather, renders them of very little u&s;e in Navigation.</P>
<P>As to the third Method, by the Eclip&s;es of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Planets; this mu&s;t be own'd of much greater u&s;e: Since the quickne&s;s of their Motion, e&s;pe|cially as to the innermo&s;t, makes the Moment of their Immer&s;ion into, or Emer&s;ion from <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Shadow ve|ry di&s;tinct and nice; and their fre|quency, which is almo&s;t one for every Day, renders them fit for the con&s;tant u&s;es of Navigation. Nor
<PB N="13" REF="12">
have we hitherto had any other Me|thod &s;o u&s;eful at Land as this. Yet are there great Difficulties belonging to this Method; e&s;pecially at Sea. The be&s;t Tables of their Motions are hitherto too imperfect to be at all times depended on, as to the exact ab&s;olute Time of their Celebration: And they require Tele&s;copes of &s;uch a length as have not hitherto been manageable at Sea, in that &s;tate of To&s;|&s;ing and Agitation, which Ships there are &s;ubject to: Which difficulties, added to the impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;eeing the&s;e Eclip&s;es for about three Months every Year, when <HI>Jupiter</HI> is near the Sun, renders this Method at pre&s;ent of &s;mall u&s;e in Navigation.</P>
<P>Nor can the fourth Method, or the di&s;tance of the Moon from the Sun, with its Appul&s;e to, or Occultation of tho&s;e fixed Stars, which lye along its cour&s;e, give us the Longitude to &s;uffi|cient exactne&s;s. For, to &s;ay nothing here of the &s;lowne&s;s of the Moon's
<PB N="14" REF="13">
Motion, the want of the utmo&s;t accu|racy of even the place of &s;ome of the&s;e fixed Stars them&s;elves, and of the Sun it &s;elf; or of the nece&s;&s;ity of the u&s;e of &s;maller Tele&s;copes, even in this Ca&s;e, as well as of the trouble of the Calculation and Con&s;truction, which are le&s;&s;er Difficulties here al&s;o; 'Tis plain the Theory of the Moon, e&s;pe|cially in &s;ome po&s;itions, is not exact enough hitherto for our purpo&s;e; as not &s;erving for this Longitude nearer than to two or three Degrees: where|as the Seamen want it within one Degree, or le&s;s. Tho' indeed it mu&s;t be allow'd, that if the Moon's The|ory could be once &s;o far perfected, that its place might be with certain|ty calculated nearer than to two Mi|nutes of a Degree, this would be a very u&s;eful Method in order to the Di&s;covery of the Longitude at Sea. Which Improvement therefore of it's Theory is a thing highly de&s;ireable in A&s;tronomy.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14">
We come now to the <HI>Terre&s;trial</HI> Methods, and to tho&s;e difficulties which render them al&s;o incapable of di&s;covering the Longitude, with that certainty, and to that degree of ex|actne&s;s, which the purpo&s;es of Na|vigation require. Thus the Curve lines of the Variation of the Nee|dle, which is the fir&s;t Terre&s;trial Me|thod, are of &s;mall u&s;e, becau&s;e the Laws of that Variation are not yet brought to a &s;ufficient certainty, not|with&s;tanding the mo&s;t u&s;eful endea|vours of Dr. <HI>Halley</HI> in that Matter: The Neighbourhood of Iron Mines, of Iron, or of Load&s;tones them&s;elves, does &s;ometimes di&s;turb the general Rules, and deceive the Ob&s;ervers of that Variation: The Po&s;ition of tho&s;e Curves, too far Ea&s;tward and We&s;t|ward, in a great part of the World, renders this Variation u&s;ele&s;s as to any general Di&s;covery of the Longitude: and even there where the Po&s;ition of the&s;e Curves is the mo&s;t advanta|geous,
<PB N="16" REF="15">
as it is about the Cape of Good Hope, and a con&s;iderable way on both &s;ides of it, yet is the di&s;tance of tho&s;e Curves for the difference of one De|gree of Variation, about 100 Geo|graphical Miles, <HI>i. e.</HI> near two Degrees of a great Circle; and &s;o this Method is incapable of &s;hewing the Longitude very nicely in any Ca&s;e what&s;oever.</P>
<P>Thus the &s;econd Terre&s;trial Me|thod, by Clocks or Watches, tho' the ea&s;ie&s;t to under&s;tand and practice of all others, has been &s;o long in vain attempted at Sea, that we &s;ee little Hopes of its great u&s;efulne&s;s there. Watches are &s;o influenc'd by heat and cold, moi&s;ture and drought; and their &s;mall Springs, Wheels, and Pe|vets are &s;o incapable of that degree of exactne&s;s, which is here requir'd, that we believe all wi&s;e Men give up their Hopes from them in this Matter. Clocks, govern'd by long Pendulum's, go much truer: But then the diffe|rence of Gravity in different Latitudes,
<PB N="17" REF="16">
the lengthening of the Pendulum-rod by heat, and &s;hortening it by cold; together with the different moi&s;ture of the Air, and the to&s;&s;ings of the Ship, all put together, are circum|&s;tances &s;o unpromi&s;ing, that we be|lieve Wi&s;e Men are almo&s;t out of hope of Succe&s;s from this Method al&s;o.</P>
<P>And as for the Log-Line, and Dead-Reckoning, which is the third Terre&s;tri|al Method, they were the known defi|ciencies of this common way, as al|ter'd by Storms, and Currents, and the Inaccuracies of the way it &s;elf, and of even the Latitude, as commonly taken; together with the too frequent and enduring cloudy Weather, when they can take no Latitude at all; which have occa&s;ion'd the Seamen to de&s;ire &s;ome other A&s;&s;i&s;tance for the Di&s;covery before us.</P>
<P>We now come to our la&s;t Bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>viz.</HI> to give the World a &s;hort Hi&s;tory of our own Propo&s;al; from what oc|ca&s;ions,
<PB N="18" REF="17">
and by what &s;teps this our Method was fir&s;t di&s;cover'd, and has arriv'd at its pre&s;ent degree of Matu|rity. As to which matter, the Rea|der is to know, that &s;omewhat above a Year ago, Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton</HI> and Mr. <HI>Dit|ton,</HI> with &s;ome other common Friends, &s;pent part of an Afternoon and the Evening together. Mr. <HI>Ditton</HI> took an occa&s;ion, among other common di&s;cour&s;e, to ob&s;erve to Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton,</HI> that <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The nature of Sounds would afford a method, true at lea&s;t in Theory, for the di&s;covery of the Longitude';</Q> &s;ince <HI>The difference be|tween the apparent time, where the Sound is made, and where it is heard; abating on|ly the time for its diffu&s;ion, which was now well known; is the difference of the Lon|gitude of tho&s;e two Places in time.</HI> Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton</HI> immediately own'd the truth of the Propo&s;ition, and added, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That as to the Propagation of Sounds, he remembred to have him&s;elf plainly
<PB N="19" REF="18">
heard the Explo&s;ion of great Guns about 90 or 100 Miles, <HI>viz.</HI> when the <HI>French</HI> Fleet was engag'd with Ours, off <HI>Beachy-head</HI> in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex;</HI> [which was <HI>A.D.</HI> 1690.] and him&s;elf was at <HI>Cambridge;</HI> and that he had been inform'd, that in one of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Wars, the &s;ound of the like Explo&s;ions had been heard in|to the very middle of <HI>England,</HI> at a much greater di&s;tance. Upon this, Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton,</HI> when they part|ed, told Mr. <HI>Ditton,</HI> that he took the thing to be &s;o con&s;iderable, that tho it had been di&s;cour&s;ed of in mix'd Company, after an unguard|ed manner, yet he look'd on it as fit to be conceal'd; &s;ince no body could tell, what Improvements might on farther Con&s;ideration be built upon &s;uch a Foundation.'</Q> Which Advice Mr. <HI>Ditton</HI> follow'd; and ac|cordingly de&s;ir'd and obtain'd the Silence of tho&s;e, that had then heard,
<PB N="20" REF="19">
what had pa&s;s'd. This Propo&s;ition about Sounds, and their di&s;tant Pro|pagation, with re&s;pect to the Longi|tude, did upon this &s;o fix it &s;elf in Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton</HI>'s Mind, and did occa|&s;ion &s;uch Improvements there, that in le&s;s than two Days time he brought a &s;mall Paper to Mr. <HI>Ditton,</HI> contain|ing a Scheme, how that Theory of Mr. <HI>Ditton</HI>'s about Sounds might be reduc'd to Practice, and be actually apply'd to the di&s;covery of the Lon|gitude at Sea; which was then not much unlike the former branch of the following E&s;&s;ay, only more im|perfect: Which Scheme Mr. <HI>Ditton</HI> ap|prov'd of. Soon after this Mr. <HI>Ditton</HI> imparted this Di&s;covery to a very good Friend, belonging to the Admi|ralty, in order to gain farther light as to its practicablene&s;s at Sea; and that proper Que&s;tions might by him be ask'd of Seafaring Men re|lating thereto, without any Su&s;pici|on;
<PB N="21" REF="20">
which could not well be avoid|ed if we our &s;elves had ask'd them; e&s;pecially &s;ince the Notion was then got abroad, that we had a Project about the Longitude to propo&s;e to the World. The re&s;ult of this En|quiry was, that tho&s;e Sea-men our Friend enquir'd of, did not remem|ber to have heard Sounds at Sea any whit near &s;o far as the before|mention'd Examples &s;hew'd they had been heard at Land; which difficulty put &s;ome &s;top to our Progre&s;s for a little while. However, at la&s;t, after farther enquiry, the final re&s;ult was this, That tho' Sounds were not ordi|narily either at Sea or Land heard very far, yet that was not at Sea, more than at Land, any certain Argument, that they could not &s;pread &s;o far; becau&s;e Sounds had been heard a full Degree at lea&s;t, or 60 Geo|graphical Miles over Sea, even with|out any extraordinary Contrivance,
<PB N="22" REF="21">
either at the &s;ounding Body, or the Ear; both which were yet, for cer|tain, capable of great improvements, in order to the enlargement of that di&s;tance. So that the Objection &s;tart|ed again&s;t the &s;preading of Sounds at Sea &s;eem'd to be in a manner over, and we at liberty to pro&s;ecute our De&s;ign, as before, of di&s;covering the Longitude by means of it. About this time Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton</HI> di&s;cover'd and propos'd a great Improvement of his own to this Method; <HI>viz.</HI> That the Guns, which were to make the Explo&s;ions in the former Ca&s;e, might al&s;o carry Shells, full of Powder, or &s;uch other combu&s;tible Matter, as would take fire at the utmo&s;t Alti|tude; and thereby certainly and ex|actly exhibit the point of the Azi|muth, and the Di&s;tance of the &s;ounding Body; and &s;o join the u&s;e of the Eye and Ear together for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Tho' at the fir&s;t he mu&s;t
<PB N="23" REF="22">
own he &s;u&s;pected, that the Apparent Diameter of that Light or Fire would in great di&s;tances be &s;o &s;mall, as not to be there vi&s;ible. In this very junc|ture a day of extraordinary Fire|works happen'd [it was the Thank&s;|giving day for the Peace, <HI>July</HI> 7th, 1713.] the Contemplation of which, did much revive and encourage this Notion: and the certain Account he &s;oon had, that tho&s;e Fire-works, nay, the &s;mall Stars, into which the Rock|ets commonly re&s;olv'd them&s;elves, were plainly vi&s;ible no le&s;s than 20 Miles, put an end to his doubts im|mediately; and made him very &s;e|cure, that &s;uch large Shells as might be fir'd at a va&s;tly greater height, would for certain be vi&s;ible for about 100 Miles; which he look'd on as nearly the limit of Sounds al&s;o, as to any purpo&s;es of Longitude. This Improvement of Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton</HI>'s, which was al&s;o then for the main the &s;ame
<PB N="24" REF="23">
with the &s;econd Branch now contain'd in this Paper, was al&s;o approv'd of by Mr. <HI>Ditton,</HI> and agreed to as fit to be a part of the former De&s;ign for the Di&s;covery of the Longitude at Sea. Mr. <HI>Ditton</HI> did farther add, for Im|provement, a &s;ure Method of Tri|gonometrical Calculation, to a&s;cer|tain from the Ob&s;ervations the ho|rary Difference of Meridians (and by con&s;equence the Difference of Lon|gitude in Degrees) between the Ship's Place, and that of Explo&s;ion; with|out computing the Time of the Sound's propagation: but &s;ince this Method is &s;omewhat more opero&s;e than that, which is propos'd hereafter, he choo&s;es to omit it. He did al&s;o fir&s;t ob&s;erve that great U&s;e of our Method at Land, in the Surveying of Countries, for the Perfection of Geography; which was al&s;o readily taken notice of by Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> and afterward by Dr. <HI>Halley,</HI> and
<PB N="25" REF="24">
that both of their own accord, upon our fir&s;t communication of our Me|thod to them. For when Matters were brought to &s;o hopeful a Po&s;ture, and nece&s;&s;ary Tables were preparing for the actual Practice of the whole Method, we began to think of in|timating to the Publick, that we had a new Di&s;covery, as to the Longi|tude, to propo&s;e to the World. Which we &s;oon did, by our Letter in&s;erted in the Paper call'd the <HI>Guar|dian,</HI> of <HI>July</HI> 14. and repeated by another in the &s;ame Author's Paper call'd the <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> of <HI>December</HI> 10. following. Having before commu|nicated the matter to the illu&s;trious Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> as we did afterward to tho&s;e great Men, Dr. <HI>Clarke</HI> Rector of St. <HI>James</HI>'s, Dr. <HI>Halley</HI> of <HI>Oxford,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Cotes</HI> of <HI>Cambridge.</HI> How far we profited by this Communication, and what their Opinions were con|cerning our Method, we need not

<P>For if the time while the whole Body of the Sun is ri&s;ing or &s;etting, which may be very nicely ob&s;erv'd at Sea, be added at Night to, and &s;ub&s;tracted in the Morning from, the Time that any Table of its ri&s;ing

<P><HI>N.B.</HI> The Exact time of the Sun's ri&s;ing and &s;etting, at all Declinations, and in all Latitudes, is found by the following Rule of Trigonometry.</P>

the &s;ame two Sides, which Angle is the Mea&s;ure of the Time.</P>
<P>For Example. Suppo&s;e an Hull of a Ship was fix'd in the Latitude of <HI>London,</HI> and there were occa&s;ion to compute exactly the Time of the ri|&s;ing and &s;etting of the Sun, for the longe&s;t Day of the Year. The Cal|culation is thus.</P>

<P>Note al&s;o that the Amplitude can|not be exactly taken even at Sea, without the like Allowance for Re|fraction. And the Difference of Am|plitude, when the fir&s;t Edge of the Sun touches, and the la&s;t leaves the Horizon, is to be added or &s;ub|&s;tracted in this Ca&s;e, to that when it appears to be half &s;et; in order to ob|tain the Sun's true Amplitude: as well as we added or &s;ub&s;tracted the Diffe|rence of time before, for the exact Ad|ju&s;tment of the true Moment of its ri&s;ing and &s;etting.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="59"><HI>The Solution of the Problem.</HI></P>
<P>Let a great Gun, with a Shell that will take Fire at its utmo&s;t Altitude, be di&s;charg'd perpendicularly 6440 Feet high above the Surface of the Sea, e|very Night exactly at 12 a-Clock, at all convenient Di&s;tances and Situations, and from known Places. This Di&s;|charge will, by the Di&s;tance and Point of the Compa&s;s of its Sound, nearly give the Longitude and Latitude to all Places or Ships within the hearing thereof: And it will, by the &s;ame Di|&s;tance and Azimuth of its Light or Fire, exactly give the &s;ame Longitude and Latitude to all Places or Ships within the Sight thereof; according to the foregoing Lemmata. <HI>Q.EI.</HI></P>
<P>For Example: Let us &s;uppo&s;e an Hull fixed in a known place, 30 De|grees more We&s;tward than the Me|ridian of <HI>London;</HI> and that every Mid|night its Great Gun is di&s;charged, as before; and that a Ship &s;ailing by at
<PB N="61" REF="60">
54&prime; 40&Prime; after Eleven, &s;ees the Fire or Light 30&prime; above the Horizon; <HI>i. e.</HI> by a foregoing Table, at 60 Minutes, or Geographical Miles di&s;tance. It was therefore 12 a Clock at the Hull, when it was only 11 h. 55&prime; at the Ship. So that the difference of time is 5&prime; and the difference of Longitude upon the E|quator 1&deg; 15&prime; and the Ships Longitude from the Meridian of <HI>London</HI> is here|by known to be 31&deg; 15&prime; We&s;tward.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e al&s;o that the Weather be &s;uch that only the &s;ound can be heard, and that it proves to be &s;o weak as to be ju&s;tly e&s;teem'd 60 Geographi|cal Miles, or one Degree of a great Circle, di&s;tant. This Di&s;tance an|&s;wers to 5&prime; of time, for the interval of the Propagation of the Sound: which therefore, if it be heard ju&s;t at 12 a Clock at the Ship, will imply that when the Explo&s;ion was made it was at the Ship only 55&prime; pa&s;t eleven, the &s;ame moment that it was full 12 at the Hull; and that therefore the
<PB N="62" REF="61">
difference of Meridians is the &s;ame as before, viz. 5&prime; in time, or 1&deg; 15&prime; up|on the Equator, We&s;tward.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e farther, that the Light be &s;een at the &s;ame time that the Sound is heard; with no other than the &s;mall difference of the &s;lowne&s;s of the Sound, in compari&s;on of the in&s;tan|taneous motion of the Light; and that the difference of time between the mo&s;t elevated appearance of the Light and the hearing of the Sound; (which may be ea&s;ily and exactly ob|&s;erv'd by any tolerable movement what&s;oever, or by a Pendulum, that vibrates half Seconds:) be found to be 4&prime; 40&Prime; or, which is all one, that the intire difference of the Explo&s;ion made, and of the Sound heard, be 5&prime; in time. This difference will imply the di&s;tance of the Ship from the Ex|plo&s;ion to be 60 Geographical Miles. And if the &s;ound is heard at the Ship 54&prime; 40&Prime;&punc; after Eleven, the difference of Longitude upon the Equator will
<PB N="63" REF="62">
&s;till be 1&deg; 15&prime; and the real Longitude from <HI>London</HI> will be 31&deg; 15&prime; We&s;tward, as before.</P>
<P>If the Azimuth of the Fire or Light be al&s;o ob&s;erv'd, take with your Com|pa&s;&s;es from your Scale the true di&s;tance, 60 Minutes, or Miles, and &s;et it from the place of the Hull, on the true Angle, in any large Map or Sea-Chart. This will determine the very Point where the Ship is, both for Longitude and La|titude. The &s;ame thing may be done for the Sound, in ca&s;e the Point of the Compa&s;s be ob&s;erv'd al&s;o.</P>
<P>If the Latitude of the Ship be known, take the known di&s;tance, ei|ther by the means of the Light or Fire &s;een, or, if the Weather be too Fog|gy for that, of the Sound heard; and let it cro&s;s the known parallel of La|titude in the Chart; and this will de|termine the Longitude. The like is to be done for the Latitude, were the Longitude fir&s;t known. But that not being the u&s;ual ca&s;e, it needs not be
<PB N="64" REF="63">
farther in&s;i&s;ted on. Nor need we &s;hew how all this may be done by Calculation al&s;o: &s;ince tho&s;e that un|der&s;tand any thing of Navigation can|not be to &s;eek therein.</P>
<P><HI>N.B.</HI> In ca&s;e &s;ome parts of the Ocean prove &s;o very deep and rough that no Hulls can be fixed in them, the way to recover the Longitude, which may be by this means interrup|ted, is rightly propo&s;ed by Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> him&s;elf, in his Paper delivered in to the Committee of the Hou&s;e of Commons, <HI>viz.</HI> to &s;ail obliquely from the la&s;t Hull into the Parallel of the next, and &s;o along the &s;ame; till up|on approaching to that next Hull the Longitude be anew recover'd, and the Voyage be continued as before. Nor is this Interruption of any con&s;e|quence; becau&s;e it cannot happen but in places where there is no Dan|ger; and where Seamen are under no concern for the knowledge of the Longitude.</P>

<P N="1">(1.) IF in all proper Roads of Ships &s;uch a great Gun be plac'd and di&s;charg'd, exactly every Mid|night, whether on Shoars, or I&s;lands, or in Hulls, at the Di&s;tances of a|bout 600 Geographical Miles or 10 Degrees, All Ships that &s;ail with|in any tolerable Di&s;tance may com|monly every Week or Ten Days thereby correct their Reckoning, and know their Longitude, as well as Latitude, even when the Heavens are not clear enough to make Cele|&s;tial Ob&s;ervations for either.</P>

well enough &s;hew the Longitude du|ring every one of tho&s;e &s;hort Di&s;tan|ces between the Hulls; and &s;o will render the knowledge thereof &s;till more univer&s;al.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) If one &s;uch Row of Hulls be any where found too defective, a double Row may there be laid, Pair by Pair, in the &s;ame [or equidi&s;tant] Meridians; with proper Di&s;tincti|ons in the Sounds, or the Light, to prevent mi&s;taking one Row for the other. Nor will there, in this Ca&s;e, be room for almo&s;t any Uncertainty, &s;ince even in Cloudy Weather, as much as the Wind carries away the Sound of any one, &s;o much will it u&s;ually bring the Sound of ano|ther.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) If it be any where nece&s;&s;ary, Ma&s;ts may be Erected upon Hollow Empty Ve&s;&s;els, with White Spheres at their Tops; and the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els may be fix'd in proper Places, at

equal Di&s;tances between the Hulls, for the more &s;ure guiding the Ships in Places of Danger. And &s;ince from the Top of any Ma&s;t that is 88 Feet High, the Top of another as high may be di&s;covered at the Di|&s;tance of 20 Miles, there will hard|ly be occa&s;ion for more of the&s;e Ve&s;|&s;els any where than one every 120 Miles: Nor will the&s;e Ma&s;ts and Ve&s;&s;els be any Annual Charges at all.</P>

(6.) Signals of all Sorts may be given by this Method, by mutual Agreement.

(7.) If in any clear Night a &s;uffi|cient Number of &s;uch Explo&s;ions were made at proper Di&s;tances in any Country, and convey'd in or|der from one to another; &s;o that the Second Gun were fired when the Light of the Fir&s;t was &s;een, or other|wi&s;e; with the Ob&s;ervation of the exact apparent Times when they were made, when the Light was &s;een, what Angle, or how long that Light was above the Horizon, and what Azimuth it had; both the Longitude and Latitude, as well as the Di&s;tance and Po&s;ition of all the&s;e Places, might by this means be rea|dily determin'd at Land; e&s;pecially if the Experiments were repeated &s;everal times, and were compar'd one with another.

<P><HI>N.B.</HI> This Method of Survey is no hard Thing in Practice, even to tho&s;e that know little of the Ma|thematicks: For any Right Angle, &s;et by a Plummet or Level, with Two Pins or Points, for the Eye and for the Object, does by the Propor|tion of its Sides give the Angle above the Horizon; by the Angle its Horizontal Side makes with the Meridian, it gives the Azimuth; and by the Interval of Time be|tween the Light and Sound, it gives the Di&s;tance of every Place from that of Explo&s;ion, according to the Figure following. <PB N="71" REF="70">

Nor is there, we think, any way yet di&s;cover'd of &s;urveying Countries and Kingdoms that can compare with this, either for Expedition, Cer|tainty or Cheapne&s;s. A Specimen of which we hope &s;oon to give the World in an Actual Survey of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and their Coa&s;ts hereby; if the Publick plea&s;e to give us Encouragement and A&s;&s;i|&s;tance therein.</P>
<P N="8">(8.) The way of ca&s;ting a Shell 6440 Feet high is very ea&s;y: for the &s;ame Force or Charge of Gun-pow|der that will ca&s;t any Shell 12880 Feet for its utmo&s;t Random, at the Elevation of 45 Degrees, will cer|tainly ca&s;t the &s;ame Shell perpendi|cularly upward 6440 Feet, as we have already ob&s;erv'd. And &s;ince the time of this entire perpendicu|lar Projection, or A&s;cent and De&s;cent
<PB N="73" REF="72">
together, is 40&Prime;, or &s;ome very &s;mall Matter more; on Account of the Re&s;i&s;tance of the Air; We have ano|ther &s;ure Way of Adju&s;ting the &s;ame Projection to that Height; <HI>viz.</HI> by ob&s;erving what Quantity of Powder will ca&s;t the Shell high enough to &s;tay very little above 40&Prime; in the Air, before it falls to the Ground.</P>
<P N="9">(9.) This Method of firing Pow|der, or other combu&s;tible Matter, at, or very near the utmo&s;t Height of 6440 Feet, may be well enough put in practice, even tho' &s;ome con&s;ide|rable Error &s;hould be committed in the adju&s;ting the Fu&s;ee to give Fire in 20&Prime;. Since the Mi&s;take of even a Fifth Part, or Four entire Seconds, in that Ca&s;e, would produce but an Error of the 25th Part of the whole Altitude: and the Mi&s;take of a Tenth Part, or Two Seconds, would occa&s;ion an Alteration of no more than the Hundredth Part thereof.
<PB N="74" REF="73">
This is evident, becau&s;e this Time belongs to the highe&s;t Part of the Projectils Motion, which is the &s;lowe&s;t: And becau&s;e the Lines de&s;crib'd by all A&s;cending and De|&s;cending Bodies are &s;till in a Dupli|cate Proportion of the Times of &s;uch their A&s;cent and De&s;cent.</P>
<P N="10">(10.) If one or more Rows of &s;uch Hulls were laid in the &s;ame or Equidi&s;tant Meridians, Southward or otherways, Ships might with greater Safety than formerly go to di&s;cover tho&s;e Parts of the Globe which are hitherto undi&s;cover'd. Nor can we at pre&s;ent gue&s;s what Advantages may thereby accrue to the Parts of the World already di&s;|covered.</P>
<P N="11">(11.) Every one of the&s;e Hulls may be Places of Ob&s;ervation as to the Variation of the Needle, to the Currents, to the Soil, the Fowls, the Fi&s;hes, and other <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of the

<PB N="75" REF="74">
&s;everal Places where they are fixed; and an excellent Means of keeping up a mutual Corre&s;pondence be|tween the &s;everal Parts of the Globe, for all u&s;eful Purpo&s;es what|&s;oever.</P>
<P N="12">(12.) As this Method ought to be put in Practice by the Con&s;ent of all Trading Nations; &s;o ought every one of the Hulls employ'd therein to have a legal Protection from them all; And it ought to be a great Crime with every one of them, if any other Ships either injure them, or endeavour to imitate their Explo|&s;ions, for the Amu&s;ement and De|ception of any.</P>
<P N="13">(13.) Since the Charges of the Powder for each Gun will be very &s;mall; &s;ince the Shells and their Contents come to no great Price neither; &s;ince the Per&s;ons employ'd in the Hulls may be in part taken out of &s;uch Places where they are
<PB N="76" REF="75">
maintain'd at the Publick Charge already; and &s;o will require only &s;ome Additional Rewards, or Future Privileges for &s;uch their Service; And &s;ince the Land-Explo&s;ions, which will be much the mo&s;t nu|merous, will be withal much the cheape&s;t; It will appear, upon the Whole, that the Annual or Con&s;tant Expences of this Method will be comparatively very &s;mall and incon|&s;iderable: e&s;pecially if they are, as they ought to be, equally di&s;tributed among the &s;everal Trading Nations of the World.</P>
<LIST>
<PB N="77" REF="76">
<HEAD>The Advantages of this Me|thod.</HEAD>
<ITEM>(1.) THIS Method requires no Depth of A&s;tronomy, no Nicety in In&s;truments, and but &s;eldom any Cele&s;tial Ob&s;ervations at all, either as to the Latitude, or the Hour at the Ship; and &s;o is to even the common Sailors the <HI>mo&s;t Practi|cable.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>(2.) It does generally determine the very Place of the Ship, both as to <HI>Longitude</HI> and <HI>Latitude</HI> at once, and &s;o is the <HI>mo&s;t Compendious.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>(3.) It does generally determine the very Place to a few Miles, at the farthe&s;t; and &s;o is the <HI>mo&s;t Accurate.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>(4.) It affords Help even in Clou|dy and Foggy Weather, when no Cele&s;tial Ob&s;ervations can be made, and the <HI>Latitude</HI> it &s;elf cannot be otherwi&s;e found, and &s;o is the <HI>mo&s;t General.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="78" REF="77">
(5.) It will frequently afford a double Ob&s;ervation Two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Nights, from the &s;ame Hull to the &s;ame Ship, and &s;o is the <HI>mo&s;t &s;ecure.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>(6.) It will commonly afford a double way of Ob&s;ervation at the &s;ame time, by the Eye and by the Ear, which will confirm or correct one another; and &s;o is the <HI>mo&s;t certain.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>(7.) The more inaccurate Branch, by the Sound, is not only more uni|ver&s;al than the other; but is al&s;o much more exact than any Method formerly di&s;cover'd: So that in the very wor&s;t Circum&s;tances this way is certainly the <HI>very be&s;t.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>(8.) It is the mo&s;t undoubted and exact where there is the greate&s;t Want and Danger: And if it &s;hould at all be deficient, it is there only where there is no Danger, and hard|ly any occa&s;ion for knowing the Longitude, as has been &s;hew'd alrea|dy. So that on all Accounts it is plainly the <HI>mo&s;t U&s;eful</HI> and <HI>Advan|tageous.</HI></ITEM>
