An old bard, in de&s;cribing the diet of OBERON, gives him a very appro|priate band of mu&s;icians at his table.<Q><L>But all the while his eye was &s;erv'd,</L>
<L>We cannot think his ear was &s;tarv'd.</L>

<L>The humming dorr, the dying &s;wan,</L>
<L>And each a chief mu&s;ician.</L></Q> I copied the&s;e lines to have an opportunity of reviving the felicitous word PITTERING&mdash;&s;o imitative of the peculiar &s;hrill and &s;hort cry of the gra&s;hopper; which is <HI>pit, pit, pit,</HI> quick|ly repeated. This word however is not to be found in John&s;on. I have al&s;o introduced in the fir&s;t Romance ano|ther ob&s;olete term, SCATTERLING, u&s;ed by Spen&s;er for a va|gabond. We have lo&s;t a great many exqui&s;ite and <HI>picture&s;que expre&s;&s;ions,</HI> through the dullne&s;s of our lexicographers; and have impoveri&s;hed the <HI>natural graces</HI> of our language.

<L N="110">Each tear was genuine and each fiction truth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The ALHAMBRA was a &s;ublime &s;pecimen of Saracenic architecture, combining the gigantic in its outline, and delicacy in its minuter parts. It was a gorgeous magnifi|cence, of which the timid and cha&s;ti&s;ed architecture of Greece can yield no &s;en&s;ation. It has been often de|&s;cribed; its bath &s;urrounded by flowers, and orange trees; its marble courts; its ceilings and walls incru&s;ted with the mo&s;t intricate fret-work, gilded and painted; its fanta&s;tic mo&s;aic; its court of colo&s;&s;al lions; its va&s;t length of co|lonnades; its columns of virgin marble; its fountains, its glittering floors, and its delicious gardens; the&s;e form &s;ome of its romantic features.</P>
<P>The "<HI>Hi&s;toria de las Guerras civiles de Granada</HI>" I read at an early period, and at a time when I could mo&s;t enjoy it, for I believed it to be an authentic hi&s;tory. It is however a con&s;iderable romance, relating the civil wars of the two Moori&s;h factions in Spain. It is embelli&s;hed with numerous <HI>Romances Antiguos;</HI> the word <HI>romance,</HI> in Spani&s;h and French, means <HI>ballad,</HI> of the &s;ame &s;pecies of our rude ballads pre&s;erved in the "Reliques of Ancient Poetry." The&s;e romances are however more elegant, and two have been tran&s;lated by the editor of the "Reliques." Often on the plain before the towers of the Alhambra, mu&s;t many a maiden have beheld the man &s;he loved, become the de&s;troyer of her race; or her own relatives pur&s;uing with fire and &s;word the family of her lover. In compo&s;ing the&s;e lines, I had in my mind one of the&s;e romances, where a very delicate circum&s;tance is ingeniou&s;ly conceived by the poet. In "<HI>la fie&s;ta de San Juan,</HI>" while the Moors a&s;&s;em|ble to jou&s;t in the plain before the Alhambra, Xarifa and Fatima, who had not been together for &s;ome time, are at the window of a turret. Xarifa exclaims to Fatima, Sweet &s;i&s;ter, how thou art touched by love! Thou wert wont to have colour on thy cheek, and thou art now pale! Thou wert wont to talk of our loves, and thou art now &s;ilent. Come nearer to the window, thou wilt &s;ee the lovely Abindarraez; his &s;plendid equipage, and his gallant air. Fatima re|plies, if I am pale, it is not that I am touched with love; if I have lo&s;t my colours, alas! have I not a ju&s;t cau&s;e? Has not that Alabez killed my father? pointing to a knight on the plain.<Q><L>No eftoy tocada de amores</L>

<P>AMONG the literary trea&s;ures of a learned and valued friend<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">FRANCIS DOUCE, E&s;q. of Gower-&s;treet.</NOTE>, has been long admired a Per&s;ian Ma|nu&s;cript, &s;plendidly illuminated. The univer&s;al language of painting had &s;o far rendered it intelligible, that our eyes had in&s;tructed us, it was a hi&s;tory of Love. It was, at length, in&s;pected by two competent judges; Sir John Kennaway, who&s;e urbanity of manners claims the re|membrance of his friends, and Major Ou&s;eley, a &s;tudious Orientali&s;t of ta&s;te. We now found that it contained the Loves of <HI>MEJNOUN</HI> and <HI>LEILA,</HI> who&s;e &s;tory (told by different poets) is as popular in the Ea&s;t, as the loves of Abelard and Eloi&s;a, or tho&s;e of Petrarch and Laura, are in the We&s;t.</P>
<P>The learned M. de Cardonne, the late king of France's oriental interpreter, di&s;covered in the Royal Library a copy of this Romance, and has given a &s;keleton of the &s;tory<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the Bibliotheque des Romans for July 1775.</NOTE>. It was meant perhaps but to gratify the curio&s;ity of the learned; it has no exhibition of character, no de|&s;cription of &s;cenery, no conduct of the pa&s;&s;ions. But I could perceive in the &s;implicity of analy&s;is and a tale with little

involution of fable, &s;omething which might be made to delight the imagination&mdash;a Maniac and a Lover! Vehement genius at variance with the tendere&s;t dome&s;|tic feelings! Cheri&s;hing the &s;ocial duties, yet &s;till vio|lating them by the fatal energy of an unhappy pa&s;&s;ion! The cata&s;trophe involving the fates of him&s;elf, and of all whom he loved! The local de&s;criptions were &s;u&s;|ceptible of &s;ome novelty. In a word, I di&s;covered a new Petrarch and Laura; but two fervid Orientali&s;ts, capable of more pa&s;&s;ion, more grief, and more terror. In&s;tead of the petty &s;olitude of the Valclu&s;a of Petrarch, an Arabian de&s;ert opened its numerous horrors; in&s;tead of the cold prudery of the Italian Laura, I have the re&s;olute ardour of the Arabian Leila; and in&s;tead of a poet, &s;o elegant and delicate, that his pa&s;&s;ion &s;ome &s;u&s;pect to have been only a fine chimera, I have a Lover who&s;e &s;incerity every one acknowledges, &s;ince he is di&s;tract|ed with his pa&s;&s;ion!</P>

His nu|merous
<PB N="2" REF="27">
tents were &s;tretched through many a green valley, while his innumerous herds told their ma&s;ter was now old, and in peace with the world. Ahmed in youth had been the mo&s;t enterpri&s;ing and predatory adventurer; Want had conducted him to Opulence, and Valour to Power: but in his Opulence there was no avarice, and in his Power there was no tyranny. His former life had con&s;i&s;ted but of two kinds of days, the days of council and the days of combat; the ho&s;pitable man now found no other than fe&s;tal days. Unknown to fame during his erratic youth, when his virtues became &s;ta|tionary, his magnanimous &s;oul diffu&s;ed it&s;elf in the dome&s;tic enchantments of peace; nor with the penurious feeling of age, was he negligent of that creative benevolence, that prodigality of mind, which is felt by the next generation. Old as he was, he &s;till planted young trees; and, full of glory, he &s;till &s;ought for &s;olitary &s;pots to open new foun|tains.
<PB N="3" REF="28">
He was de&s;cribed by the poets to be bountiful as the rains of &s;pring, warm as the &s;un, and cheerful as the moon; the heart of Ahmed (they &s;aid) has e&s;pou&s;ed the whole Earth, and when he dies &s;he will wail in wi|dowhood.</P>
<P>Ahmed, without offspring, &s;ighed to per|petuate him&s;elf in his de&s;cendants; and mourned to think that the populous felicity his princely and &s;olitary hand had created, &s;hould be di&s;per&s;ed with his la&s;t breath. At length he had a &s;on, the &s;olitary hope of his tribe. To this cheri&s;hed child he &s;ought to give all that in&s;truction can communicate, and all that humanity can feel. He invited the ingenious and the learned to his tent. Shewing his boy to his people, he would exclaim, Enter, ye &s;ages, and bring your in&s;truction; it is the only tribute we claim from &s;ages; or tell me where the prince can di&s;cover a &s;age, and maje&s;ty &s;hall pro&s;trate it&s;elf before wi&s;dom!</P>

The revered name of the Effendi Lebid, the Per&s;ian &s;tudent, reached the ear of the Arabian chief. Lebid had cho&s;en the tran|quillity of retirement; and when his name became every where celebrated, his per&s;on was unknown. He might have been &s;eated with indolent glory in the chair of the royal Medra&s;&s;eh<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An Academy.</NOTE> at I&s;pahan, but he preferred to interrogate Nature in a &s;ublime Solitude. In the plains of Shinaar he had accurately mea&s;ured a degree of the great circle of the earth; on the &s;hores of the Bo&s;phorus he had taught the de&s;pi&s;ed inhabitants the arts of an invaluable fi&s;hery, and the voice of population broke along tho&s;e &s;olitary &s;kies. In benighted de&s;erts he di&s;covered a path for the caravan, by the guidance of a friendly &s;tar; and the &s;ame eye that traced the cour&s;e of a &s;tar, watched the growth of a flower. He gave to chemi&s;try the alembic
<PB N="5" REF="30">
which &s;till retains its Arabian extraction in its name. He had compo&s;ed one of the Moallakat, or poems &s;u&s;pended in the tem|ple of Mecca, and Arabia was delighted by the novelty of his diction, which was a fine uni&s;on of picture and of melody; it flowed with the confluent richne&s;s of the various tribes of Arabia; and &s;electing from every dialect its felicitous expre&s;&s;ions, he poured an enchantment over every period. He en|riched the copiou&s;ne&s;s of the Arabic, by the delicacy of the Per&s;ian, and the fire of the Turki&s;h mu&s;e; and received the &s;ecret graces and the fine conceptions of his favourite poets, as iron often, attracted by the load|&s;tone, catches &s;ome particles of the magnetic influence; and in touching the magnet be|comes it&s;elf a magnet.</P>
<P>Such was the Effendi Lebid, to who&s;e Per&s;ian academy re&s;orted tho&s;e young Ara|bians who were ambitious of acquiring Per|&s;ian literature, and habituating them&s;elves
<PB N="6" REF="31">
to Per&s;ian urbanity. Kais, the &s;on of Ah|med, proved a pupil worthy of the precep|tor. About the &s;ame time, and nearly of the &s;ame age, was there placed the lovely Leila, the only daughter of an Emir<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An Emir, di&s;tingui&s;hed by a green turban, claims his de&s;cent from Fatima the wife of Mahomet.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Effendi di&s;covered in the&s;e early a&s;|&s;ociated children that facility of di&s;po&s;ition which at once characteri&s;es genius, and a tender heart. Soon, without rivals in the academy, each was attracted to the other by a mutual admiration. Leila in&s;tructed her|&s;elf by fondly repeating the le&s;&s;ons of Kais, and Kais taught him&s;elf to retain whatever charmed Leila. With ea&s;y grace the &s;tu|dious youth di&s;clo&s;ed the mo&s;t &s;olemn truths, while the more touching and deli|cate ideas were di&s;criminated by the quick &s;u&s;ceptibility of Leila. They loved to min|gle in the &s;ame ta&s;ks, and in the arts of imagination their gentle &s;pirits perpetuated
<PB N="7" REF="32">
their fine&s;t emotions. The ver&s;e of Kais trea&s;ured their mo&s;t delicious &s;en&s;ations; from the wild intonations of Leila he often caught the air he compo&s;ed; and when they united to paint the &s;ame picture, it &s;eemed as if the &s;ame eye had directed the &s;ame hand.</P>
<P>They &s;aw each other every day, and were only &s;en&s;ible to this plea&s;ure. Their mu|tual &s;tudies became &s;o many interchanges of tenderne&s;s. Every day was contracted to a point of time; months rolled away on months, and their pa&s;&s;age was without a trace; a year clo&s;ed, and they knew it but by its date. Already the fir&s;t &s;park of love opened the heart of Kais; already he &s;ighed near the intendering form of Leila; already he li&s;tened for her voice when &s;he cea&s;ed to &s;peak, while her &s;oft hand, pa&s;&s;ing over his own, vibrated through his &s;hivering nerves.</P>
<P>Endearment was his occupation. He loved to con&s;ider him&s;elf as her &s;lave, and

playfully intreated to be chided by her charming voice. In the winter, as &s;he &s;at be&s;ide him, he burned the co&s;tly wood of aloes, and hung around perfumed tapers.

<P>In &s;ummer he blended the Turki&s;h mag|nificence with the Per&s;ian amenity.

Near its cooling murmurs he built a plea&s;ant KIOSQUE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A banquetting or &s;ummer apartment.</NOTE>. The water from the fountain was conveyed into conchs, fixed in the gilded fret-work of the ceiling, and now melodiou&s;ly chimed along, and now fell da&s;hing from &s;hell to &s;hell. The columns were embelli&s;hed with moral &s;entences from the Koran; while through the green trel|li&s;es he had &s;o thickly woven a living ta|pe&s;try

<P>Seated in the KIOSQUE, they would read the Per&s;ian Tales. The tender eyes of Leila were &s;ometimes for a moment fixed on Kais, while a warm mode&s;t &s;uffu&s;ion coloured his ingenuous cheek.

<HEAD>THE LAND OF CASHMERE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Sir William Jones, in his E&s;&s;ay on the Poetry of the Ea&s;tern Nations, tells us, <Q REND="inline">"There is a valley, to the north of Indo&s;tan, called CASHMERE; which, according to an account written by a native of it, is a perfect garden,"</Q> &amp;c. The happy temperature of this much celebrated &s;pot, and the country it&s;elf, is lately de&s;cribed by Mr. Pennant, in his Hi&s;tory of Hindo&s;tan. The following florid de&s;cription, which is not, however, merely fanciful, is compo&s;ed by a Per&s;ian poet. Major Ou&s;eley gives it us in his Per&s;ian Mi&s;cellanies, p. 175: <Q REND="inline">"I have &s;een Irak and India, Khora&s;&s;an and Per&s;ia, but no place equal to CASHMERE in beauty and in excellence of climate. During the whole year, from Ca&s;hmere to the borders of Cathay, the air, tempered by gentle &s;howers, has all the mildne&s;s of &s;pring; there are flowers and green herbage, plains and running &s;treams; pa|laces, cupolas, and public buildings, beautiful to view. On every &s;ide are ri&s;ing grounds, cry&s;tal &s;prings, and lofty trees, amid mountains covered with nut-trees, apple-trees, and fig-trees. Fe&s;tivity and plea&s;ure peculiarly abound there. In mirth and revelry the Ca&s;hmerians pa&s;s away their time on &s;ilken cu&s;hions. They all wear &s;hawls, whether of illu&s;trious birth or of the lowe&s;t cla&s;s.

What|ever &s;ide you look at, tho&s;e nymphs appear like the &s;un or moon. A thou&s;and &s;ecret &s;nares, like the links of a chain, are laid in the waving ringlets of tho&s;e fair plunderers of hearts.

"The hair, by its comparative rough|ne&s;s, and its partial concealments, accompanies and relieves the &s;oftne&s;s, clearne&s;s, and &s;moothne&s;s of the face of a beau|tiful woman. Where the hair has no natural roughne&s;s, it is often artificially curled and cri&s;ped. The in&s;trument for this purpo&s;e is certainly of very ancient date, as Virgil (who probably &s;tudied the <HI>co&s;tume</HI> of the heroic ages) makes Tur|nus &s;peak contemptuou&s;ly of Eneas for having his locks per|fumed, and as Madame de Sevign&eacute; expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>fri&s;&eacute;s natu|rellement avec des fers.</HI><Q><L>Vibratos calido ferro, myrrhaque madentes.</L></Q></P>

<P>In catholic countries, where tho&s;e unfortunate victims of avarice and &s;uper&s;tition, are &s;uppo&s;ed to renounce all idea of plea&s;ing our &s;ex, the fir&s;t ceremony is that of <HI>cutting off their</HI> HAIR, as a &s;acrifice of the mo&s;t &s;educing ornament of beauty; and the formal edge of the fillet, which prevents a &s;ingle hair from e&s;caping, is well contrived to deaden the effect of features.</P>
<P><HI>Haycinthine locks</HI> is frequent among the Arabic poets, and which &s;ir W. Jones delightfully renders

<P>It is a cu&s;tom in the ea&s;t to TINGE the EYES of women, particularly tho&s;e of a fair complexion, with an impalpable powder, prepared chiefly from crude antimony.

Age had not chilled the gentle &s;oul of Lebid, he renewed a delicious remembrance of the plea&s;ures of his youth in tho&s;e of our lovers; and enjoying their happine&s;s, fre|quently for the remuneration of Kais, he decreed a ki&s;s from the lips of Leila.

<P>He thus narrated the tender &s;tory of MES|RI and DELILAH. Me&s;ri, that affectionate youth, was betrothed to the lovely Delilah. They were the GRACE of the cla&s;&s;ic SCHI|RAUZ; and the tender choir of SCHIRAUZ only &s;ang of them. Already the rich PAVI|LION flames; the BOWER is fe&s;tooned, and the HYMENIAL AIR has preluded, to &s;hame the protraction of the half-reluctant maid.

ro&s;es they wreathed the hoary head of the Effendi, and his dimmed eyes would then &s;parkle with a lambent radiance like that of youth.

Yes, they are mine! are they not, Leila?&mdash;Yes, the blu&s;hing maid re|plied; thine and the Effendi's.&mdash;As Leila &s;tood near Kais, frequently the bloom of her complexion was flu&s;hed with a vermil glow, and the Effendi would compare the fair cheek of Leila, as &s;he &s;tood near her lover, to the lily, that, placed too near the ro&s;e, is crim&s;oned by its warm reflection.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="55">
The mother of Leila ob&s;erved that when &s;he quitted the academy of the Effendi, &s;he paced pen&s;ively, with reluctant feet; but on the day of her return, &s;he was &s;een tripping as &s;he went, with opening &s;miles, and light &s;teps. Leila (&s;he &s;aid) will become a cele|brated &s;tudent; to me &s;he brings only a &s;ilent form embelli&s;hed by new graces; in the academy &s;he leaves her whole &s;oul. At length the beauteous Leila &s;eemed to mourn in the tents of her father, and, to concen|trate her thoughts, &s;ought a &s;olitude of palm trees. The cautious mother com|manded the &s;laves, who accompanied her, to be vigilant over their mi&s;tre&s;s, even to her eyes. Ah! the di&s;covery was too ea&s;y! All was too faithfully reported to the pa|rents of Leila. They were told how the eyes of Kais were only occupied by the face of Leila, and how Leila never wan|dered from his &s;ide; and that in a magni|ficent Kio&s;que they pa&s;&s;ed their evenings reciting Romances.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="56">
The father of Leila was a haughty Emir. The green turban which he wore as the de&s;cendant of Fatima, was ince&s;&s;antly before his eyes, and rendered his heart obdurate. He heard with indignation of the affection of our lovers, and con&s;idered that the vulgarity of the blood of Ahmed was not yet purified through an age of nobility. Poetry he conceived was a diabolical magic, of which though his &s;anctity and his igno|rance pre&s;erved him from the influence, he had heard was potent over the feeble heart of a woman. He recalled Leila; &s;everely repri|manded the &s;ufferer for cheri&s;hing an ignoble pa&s;&s;ion for a poet without a green turban; and a&s;&s;erting that no woman &s;hould a&s;pire to be poetical: he added that terrible Per&s;ian proverb u&s;ed on the&s;e occa&s;ions, <Q REND="inline">"When the hen crows like the cock, we mu&s;t cut its throat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Chardin writes, <Q REND="inline">"Les hommes ont trop de peur de l'e&s;prit des femmes, pour leur lai&s;&s;er rien apprendre, et &s;ur|tout en matiere de poe&s;ie; il y a parmi eux ce proverbe &s;ur ce &s;ujet, <HI>&s;i la poule veut chanter, comme le coq, il lui faut couper la gorge.</HI></Q> Vol. ii. 4to. p. 187.</P></NOTE>."</Q> He hired a Dervi&s;e to admo|ni&s;h

her of the fate of an imprudent pa&s;&s;ion, and to remind her of her father's green turban; but the pompous admonition was unfelt by the enamoured beauty. The learned doctor was more &s;killed in genealogy than in eloquence; he received no other reply than the warme&s;t tears, which he per|&s;i&s;ted to &s;ay were no arguments.</P>
<P>Kais, who adored his mi&s;tre&s;s till her pre&s;ence had become a portion of his exi&s;t|ence, and who&s;e &s;oul beat with the pecu|liar vehemence of genius, had not been long &s;eparated from Leila, when he found him|&s;elf incapacitated to pur&s;ue his &s;tudies. He who, at the feet of his ma&s;ter, had &s;tood with his hands folded on his brea&s;t, to li&s;ten with reverence to his dictates, now voluntarily rejected the &s;tudious glories of the Medra&s;&s;eh. He wandered at times in his mind, and remembered nothing of the college but the affection he felt for the re|gent. He neglected his food; his whole frame was debilitated, and at times his
<PB N="33" REF="58">
actions were extravagant: as if awakening from a long reverie, he &s;eemed de&s;irous of e&s;caping from his mental irritation by the efforts of his corporeal powers. The Ef|fendi &s;aw, not without alarm, the energy of his pa&s;&s;ion; his pul&s;e was accelerated, his nights were &s;leeple&s;s, and his whole frame was &s;haken by chilly fits or glowing heats, in the variation of his pa&s;&s;ions. To mention even the name of Leila was dan|gerous. He &s;ent Kais to his father, and warned him of his pa&s;&s;ion for Leila, but Ahmed &s;olemnly forbid the alliance. The green-turbaned Emir was haughty for his de&s;cent; but Ahmed was haughty be|cau&s;e he was glorious without nobility, and derived his renown, not from men extinct in their graves, but from the living men around him.</P>
<P>In vain Ahmed forbid the pa&s;&s;ion of Kais; his nights only yielded dreams of love, and his voice only repeated amatory ver&s;es.
<PB N="34" REF="59">
Every day he compo&s;ed &s;ome intendering poem, which was &s;oon trea&s;ured in the memories of his admiring Bedoweens. As he wandered among his tents, he li&s;tened to the recitation of his own ver&s;es; the world &s;eemed occupied by his pa&s;&s;ion. The name of Leila was echoed through a wide extent of country, and the poli&s;hed poetry of Kais then promi&s;ed the immortality it has &s;ince obtained. His eminence as a poet was known to di&s;tant tribes; and in her paternal impri&s;onment Leila li&s;tened with complacency to ver&s;es painting her beauties and re&s;ounding her virtues; the immortal rhimes wa&s;ted his eternal &s;ighs, and as they were carolled by the traveller, to her the whole world &s;eemed to be the witne&s;&s;es of his affection.</P>

<P>I add the following delightful pa&s;&s;age from Major Ou&s;eley's Per&s;ian Mi&s;cellanies: <Q REND="inline">"The exce&s;&s;ive delight which the Per&s;ian nightingale derives from the enjoyment of the ro&s;e's fragrance, affords a thou&s;and beautiful allu|lu&s;ions and allegories to the ea&s;tern poet. To account for this allegorical pa&s;&s;ion entertained by the nightingale for the ro&s;e, and which is the &s;ubject of &s;o much beautiful imagery in Per&s;ian poetry, we mu&s;t con&s;ider that the plaintive voice of that &s;weet bird is fir&s;t heard at the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on of the year in which the ro&s;e begins to blow; by a natural a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, they are therefore connected as the con&s;tant and in|&s;eparable attendants of the &s;pring. It is probable too that the nightingale's favourite retreat may be the ro&s;e-garden, and the leaves of that flower occa&s;ionally his food; but it is certain that he is delighted with its &s;mell, and &s;ometimes indulges in the fragrant luxury to &s;uch exce&s;s as to fall from the branch, intoxicated and helple&s;s, to the ground."</Q></P>
<P>The coincidence between the arrival of certain birds and the flowering of certain plants, has been ob&s;erved by natu|rali&s;ts; and in Attica, the cuckoo always arriving when the fig-tree fir&s;t appeared, the cuckoo and a young fig were called by the &s;ame name.

he might again conver&s;e with his mi&s;tre&s;s. There was, not di&s;tant from her tent, a green valley, where the traveller would re&s;t after bathing in its dark grove, where the &s;hining &s;treamlet rolled between banks of oleanders and juniper &s;hrubs. Kais ob|&s;erved at that &s;pot, under the &s;hade of an umbrageous plane-tree, at mid-day, the de|vout Mu&s;&s;ulman, after his ablutions, i&s;&s;ue from the grove, &s;pread his carpet, pro&s;trate him&s;elf, and, in <Q REND="inline">"the &s;till &s;mall voice"</Q> of piety, repeat his prayers. Here, under the luxuriant canopy of the tree, he rai&s;ed a temporary &s;hed, placed a &s;mall &s;tove, and dealt out his coffee to refre&s;h the pa&s;&s;enger. He &s;pread on his table the large&s;t melons and the mo&s;t juicy pumpkins. All day our coffee-dealer tinkled a tambourine and touched a &s;antoor or p&s;altery, &s;inging Ara|bian &s;ongs or recounting Per&s;ian tales. Never yet had the keeper of a coffee-&s;hed obtained &s;uch celebrity; certainly no one was a finer mu&s;ician. Every one re&s;orted there to drink

coffee, to li&s;ten to his ver&s;es and to his tam|bourine, and to expre&s;s their &s;urpri&s;e, how &s;uch a genius &s;hould be content to boil cof|fee. Alas! every one came but Leila! She, Kais at length di&s;covered, was a captive, and not permitted to wander from the confines of her father's tents. As &s;oon as he knew this, he in&s;tantly left his &s;hed &s;tanding, with the coffee-&s;tove and the mu&s;ical in&s;truments, affixing on it an in&s;cription, purporting, that they were left for that per&s;on who, though he might not acquire the glory of a mu&s;i|cian, was willing to become u&s;eful in boiling good coffee.</P>
<P>Nothing remained but the perilous expe|dient of penetrating into the very tent of Leila. Since his la&s;t interview there was a gaiety in his di&s;po&s;itions, which now induced him to a&s;&s;ume the character of a perfumer and confectioner. He filled his ba&s;ket with tho&s;e delicacies which might &s;erve as bribes for the &s;laves of Leila. He appeared at the tent. His ba&s;ket was nicely arranged with

At length his foaming lips found a voice. Is it then with perfumes that the magnifi|cent Kais bribes? Is it with a &s;ong that he deludes a &s;imple virgin?

a tone not accordant with his &s;oftening words, the &s;uppliant lover &s;poke:&mdash;</P>
<P>Noble Emir! deem not that the pa&s;&s;ion of thy daughter has been obtained by the incantation of words. Ere I yet knew to give cadence to a ver&s;e, our &s;ighs re&s;ponded; believe me, we are none of tho&s;e who have &s;poken of love, ere we loved. Our pa&s;&s;ion was not kindled by the lightning of a glance, nor maddened by a &s;et of features; it was a pure plea&s;ure, that we fir&s;t caught from the perfection of mind. Our thoughts mingled, and our hopes ro&s;e, ere we felt the di&s;tinc|tion of &s;ex; and Leila was as my &s;i&s;ter, ere I loved her as my mi&s;tre&s;s. Is there a pa&s;&s;ion &s;o invincible as that of love, formed almo&s;t in childhood? Nature then adds to our in|clinations her own &s;weet habitudes; and it becomes, as it were, a double pa&s;&s;ion. And &s;hall a father tear his daughter from an em|brace that Nature has made holy?&mdash;De|&s;cendant of Fatima! Is humility held to be

The great Prophet, like my&s;elf, was of an ob&s;cure birth; and arrogance never marked the camel-driver. Noble Emir! thy father was a &s;on of peace, my father is a &s;on of war; Honour wreathed thy cradle, Opulence pillowed the bed of my infancy: Thou wert born illu&s;trious, I to become illu&s;trious; the glory of thy race devolved to thee, the glory of mine proceeds from me.&mdash;Is the difference e&s;&s;ential? Smile but on the &s;on of Ahmed, and behold we are both illu&s;trious.</P>
<P>The haughty Emir di&s;dainfully glanced on the pleading lover, and marking his per|fumer's dre&s;s, replied,&mdash;Deceiver of the eye! thou can&s;t only triumph over a woman: nor honour nor di&s;honour proceed from the &s;ex, who are born only to dre&s;s, to prattle,

<P>While the proud father &s;poke, Kais had gradually changed his &s;upplicatory po&s;ture, and when his invective clo&s;ed, &s;tood before him erect in dignity. He replied but by a &s;ilent glance &s;o fraught with a con&s;cious &s;u|periority, that the appalled de&s;pot &s;hrunk with receding &s;teps into the mid&s;t of his people. There he ordered to &s;ecure Leila. She lay on the ground abandoned to grief, and uttered a loud &s;hriek. Kais turning towards her, they exchanged glances. De|&s;pair writhed the &s;oft features of Leila; her eyes were haggard, and her arms &s;tretched to her lover; pa&s;&s;ion, pity, and indignation, &s;truggled in the brea&s;t of Kais. He gra&s;ped her hand; once more he felt it on his lips. Torn from his contending arms, their eyes parted not, till at the extremity of the tent he &s;aw her di&s;appear, and in &s;ilent agony

he for &s;ome time fixed his eyes on that ex|tremity, watching the wavy motions of the tent, and catching every dancing &s;hadow, every undulation of light. His fixed glance was terrible; and one might perceive by its ardour, and the emotions of his ge&s;tures, that he &s;till thought he was conver&s;ing with the departed Leila.</P>
<P>At length a &s;low and deep &s;igh heaved his brea&s;t. He &s;truck with his clenched hands his burning temples, that throbbed as he pre&s;&s;ed them; he paced vehemently around the tent, and then pau&s;ing as if a &s;udden pa&s;&s;ion had changed his emotions, he flung him&s;elf on the ground; and there more mild, more &s;ubdued, more tender, he poured copious tears; and all-con&s;cious of the pa&s;t &s;cene, he again pro&s;trated him&s;elf, and again &s;tretched his &s;uppliant hands. He &s;huddered, as the horrid &s;ilence only re|turned his melancholy voice: he rai&s;ed his eyes, and beheld him&s;elf in &s;olitude!</P>

Already through the tents of the Emir the fate of our lovers was known. The fame of Kais accompanied him wherever he went, and wherever the poet wandered he found in his admirers, &s;ympathi&s;ing companions. Scarcely was the event known, than the public anxiety turned entirely on their che|ri&s;hed bard. They a&s;&s;embled in ha&s;te, and were divided into little knots of people. Among them was an hoary traveller, who was di&s;tingui&s;hed by a tuft of plaited hair, which, when it hung loo&s;e, trailed on the ground, and he wore it wrapt about his head in&s;tead of a turban. What was re|markable, it was not his own hair, but formed of the relics of his friends, from every one of whom he had affectionately collected a handful of hair, which he had interwoven with his own. It was in this manner the traveller had memori&s;ed their affections<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This &s;ingular form of expre&s;&s;ing the &s;en&s;ibility of friend&s;hip is recorded in Bell's Travels to China, and was employed by an old and virtuous Bramin.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>Di&s;traction was in the &s;oul of Kais. The reproaches of his father, and the inalterable affection for Leila, raged with a force equal and oppo&s;ed. He &s;unk before him; he em|braced his knees: the voice of Ahmed was &s;tifled by his emotions: he rai&s;ed his hand to repul&s;e his fainting &s;on, but in touching his face, it trembled, and it dwelt there. The mother of Kais bent on one knee to &s;upport her &s;on, while one hand was locked in the hand of her venerable hero. The

<P>He &s;at motionle&s;s, and mute, and ab|&s;tracted. His companions glided into his tent, each &s;tudious to win him from de|jection; but with various men he was &s;till the &s;ame man. There was no life in his fixed and glazed eye, &s;ave at times a lin|gering tear, that, hermit-like, &s;tole &s;oli|tary from its cell.

fig-tree. The gazel would frequently lift her tender eyes on him; but her looks were unnoticed: &s;he would lick his hand till &s;he awakened him from his reverie; for a moment he fixed his eyes on her, waved his head, and gently turned her away. At times he chaunted incoherent ver&s;es, ram|bling from thought to thought with a wild and pathetic &s;weetne&s;s. Ever he de&s;canted on the eternity of Love, while the &s;ad return of his lay &s;till repeated the ruthle&s;s nature of fathers. His melancholy was yet mild, and while his heart bled, it &s;eemed patient.</P>
<P>Another change &s;ucceeded. From a total &s;tupor to the pa&s;&s;ing &s;cene, he awoke to its minute&s;t perception. He not only &s;aw what was before him, but through the vividne&s;s of imagination he &s;aw more; of every one &s;u&s;picious, but mo&s;t of his &s;uffering mother, ever be&s;ide him.

Every pa&s;&s;ion however was tran&s;ient, but that pa&s;&s;ion; every object failed to impre&s;s his mind, but the image of Leila; to his vi&s;ionary eye that form was brilliant in the light of the &s;un, and that form moved among the waving &s;hadows of the moon.</P>
<P>He could no longer &s;upport the eye of the world. In his tortured &s;en&s;ations, his language was inhuman. He called his mo|ther the wife of his father, but no relative of her child; and he &s;urlily di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his friends, one by one, for capricious, but in|veterate di&s;likes. Sometimes his anger was loquacious, his taunt bitter, his repartee cau&s;tic, while at times he was ob&s;tinately mute; but his &s;ilence concealed not the di&s;|order of his intellect, for then the vacillations of his countenance, and the gli&s;tening and rapid movements of his eye, expre&s;&s;ed his phrenzy.</P>
<P>Re&s;tle&s;s even to agony, melancholy even to fondne&s;s, romantic even to delirium, the world weighed heavy on his heart; that

<P>The full moon hung over the tent of Kais in a flood of light. He &s;tole from his tent, li&s;tening to his own foot&s;teps. He gazed; nothing moved but the gliding &s;ha|dows. In the va&s;t &s;ilence Heaven and Earth repo&s;ed. The moonlight &s;cenery touched his melancholy heart. In its &s;emi-day he views the tall tents, part fro&s;ted over by its white beams, part illumined by a yellower light.&mdash;Ble&s;&s;ed MOON!

He arrives; he falls at the feet of Ahmed. He looks in his face, and gently waves his head. The venerable Chief under&s;tood him. Rai&s;ing him, he exclaimed,&mdash;Virtuous &s;age! &s;peak, enlighten, but do not &s;ilently re|proach.&mdash;Alas!

<P>To elude his pur&s;uers, he had left the open de&s;ert and climbed among the rocks, making him&s;elf paths where eagles re&s;ted. As yet, mild in his volitions, and yet not in&s;en&s;ible to the pointed flint; to the &s;ultry thir&s;t of his parched lips; to the rage of hunger; and to the exhau&s;tion of travel in the grey and briny &s;ands. But every day
<PB N="80" REF="111">
his withering frame became le&s;s penetrable to the terrible elements: his feet acquired the &s;tonine&s;s of the rocks he trod, and he leaped carele&s;s, from aby&s;s to aby&s;s, while the torrid &s;un burnt on his naked head, and his tongue, often hanging from his mouth, felt no thir&s;t. Sen&s;ation in him had reached that exqui&s;ite degree of pain, in which pain cea&s;es to be felt. Deliriou&s;ly he &s;at on the pyramid of &s;ome rock, where he &s;eemed to inhabit the &s;olitude of Heaven, viewing no|thing but the de&s;ert of air.</P>
<P>Yet on earth, the de&s;ert frequently was not a &s;olitude. There &s;ometimes he imagined he heard at di&s;tance human voices, laughing and mocking at him; and often he raged indignant at their cruelty; nor &s;eemed to know that the&s;e were the howlings and &s;hrill cries of a&s;&s;embled jackals, who during the night yielded their mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;sful and con|tinued tones<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"In the night we were di&s;turbed by the ince&s;&s;ant cries of the jackals, which are the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;sful imaginable.

When all was quiet, and his exhau&s;ted heart it&s;elf repo&s;ed, his eye would follow the changeful cameleon, that, &s;en&s;ible of its &s;ecurity, &s;lowly changed its natural colour, while, if Kais approached, it e&s;caped with agility, varying its agitated body with rapid and tremulous hues<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. Dallaway de&s;cribes, in his "Comtantinople," among other picture&s;que &s;cenery, the cameleon <Q REND="inline">"ba&s;king on the &s;cars, as enjoying perfect &s;ecurity, changing its colour, or e&s;caping with wonderful agility.

Yet &s;ome|times was this &s;ultry &s;ilence broken, as he li&s;tened to a troop of camels, with the tink|ling chimes of their bells mingled with the heavy hum of the drow&s;y &s;ongs of the drivers, and &s;welling in the &s;tillne&s;s of the breeze; while &s;ometimes (an object plea&s;|ingly picture&s;que) a caravan took new forms as it wound its &s;low length along the rocks; at times the whole body di&s;appeared, and then gradually emerged, and then was partly concealed; till the camels, the wag|gon, and the travellers, alike melted away in the aerial di&s;tances.</P>
<P>His nerves are &s;haken; his ideas, through

inanition and fatigue, are confu&s;ed and be|wildered; a fever wa&s;tes his adu&s;t frame. He grazed on the pale brown herbage of the de&s;ert, with his gazel; recited ver&s;es at intervals, which marked his un&s;ettled emo|tions; every where he &s;emed to &s;eek de|&s;truction, and could find it no where. At his lucid intervals he examined his form and &s;huddered; reflecting on the pa&s;t, he &s;eemed to have performed impo&s;&s;ible things; and often he relap&s;ed into delirium, while he reflected he had been delirious.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the Bedoweens returned from the de&s;ert in oppo&s;ite directions; and &s;ome a&s;&s;ured that they had at times tracked the path of Kais, for they had perceived the &s;mall &s;teps of the gazel's &s;lender feet, inter|mixed with tho&s;e of its ma&s;ter; but the&s;e again they had as &s;uddenly lo&s;t.

Pointing it out to the Effendi, his aged eyes could not perceive it.&mdash;Reverend Effendi, (&s;aid the Bedoween) you may ob&s;erve it if you will look on the &s;ky; the bridge is next to the &s;ky.&mdash;I &s;ee it; it is a fearful height.

<P>The pallid moon tinged with a di&s;co|loured and uncertain gleam, the va&s;t &s;oli|tude on the acclivities of the rocks, when the watchful Bedoween heard above him the &s;ound of pacing &s;teps. At length a human voice broke out, chaunting in fanta&s;tic mea|&s;ures, while, at times, it liquified the heart with many a pathetic tone. On the narrow bridge, hanging next the &s;ky, a naked &s;pec|tre-form flitted along; &s;o wan, &s;o woe-be|gone, &s;o &s;hadowy, it &s;eemed an unble&s;&s;ed &s;pi|rit.

The Mejnoun li&s;tened till, in his inten&s;e attention, he cea&s;ed almo&s;t to breathe: it &s;eemed the voice and the ver&s;e of Lebid.

The tendere&s;t a&s;&s;ociations of thought melted to|gether at the memory of Lebid: for yet the hermit's heart was not dead to the emotions of friend&s;hip; the latent fires of his &s;oul were but covered, and wanted but the lighte&s;t air to be awakened.</P>
<P>Surely (he exclaimed) that voice is the voice of Lebid!&mdash;A &s;oft &s;hower of tears covered his face.

<P>Thy &s;on is not in&s;ane, (ob&s;erved the Ef|fendi to Ahmed), he is only delirious.

Then he would not, as he does now, publicly di&s;clo&s;e the inmo&s;t emotions of his &s;oul; but, on the contrary, he would be &s;u&s;picious of tho&s;e who were near him, in his actions wary, in his de&s;igns cunning.

bounded again&s;t her brea&s;t; &s;he calls to her attendants; &s;he &s;trains her eye to di&s;cern &s;ome object; &s;he views nothing but a mov|ing cloud. Gradually the cloud &s;eems to open; &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hes lances gleaming in the glancing &s;un-beams. She di&s;cerns ca|mels. She inquires of all around, Does my lord return? Her fond impatience exceeded the faculty of vi&s;ion. It was impo&s;&s;ible to know whether it were their own Bedoweens, or a caravan of travellers. Some who&s;e eye only pa&s;&s;ed over the &s;urface of a va&s;t indi&s;|tinct body, to plea&s;e their de&s;olated mi&s;tre&s;s, deemed it was their own party. The troop keep directing their way to the tents in their valley. At length a precur&s;or is viewed; and the breathle&s;s Bedoween ru&s;hes into the tent, exclaiming&mdash;Kais returns! and &s;unk at the feet of his mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>He returns; but to the mother of Kais the return of her &s;on was painful as his ab&s;ence. She views that cheri&s;hed &s;on led in without con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, and hardly with &s;en&s;ation. His
<PB N="111" REF="142">
drooping head re&s;ted on his bo&s;om, while his haggard looks a&s;&s;ured her he was no more &s;en&s;ible to his exi&s;tence; even at his voice, his beloved voice, &s;he &s;huddered, as it hoar&s;ely repeated, at intervals, the name of Leila. The old Ahmed approached his de|&s;ponding wife; he ki&s;&s;ed her in &s;ilence, while his tears fell with his ki&s;&s;es on her cheek. She looked on him in agony, and turned to her &s;on, and rai&s;ed her hands to Heaven, and &s;unk, fainting, into the arms of her lord.</P>
<P>Mejnoun is laid on a couch of Indian &s;ilk, placed on a carpet of Per&s;ia. His mother &s;uffers no one to attend him; her own hands &s;catter the ro&s;e-water over his disfigured body, di&s;entangle his matted hair, perfume and curl his wavy tre&s;&s;es, ve&s;t him with a tunic of the gold-cloth of Cairo, and fill his goblet with the wine of Schirauz. As &s;he knew he was delighted by Per&s;ian ele|gance, the &s;cene was Per&s;ian. His tent is hung with the tape&s;try which the needle painted, &s;u&s;pended by cords of purple &s;ilk
<PB N="112" REF="143">
running through rings of &s;ilver and gold, while mu&s;k, ambergris, and the wood of aloes breathe in a cloud from the cen&s;ers. As he was u&s;ed to be delighted by beautiful plants, &s;he placed around his couch, in va&s;es, &s;ome of the mo&s;t curious and mo&s;t fragrant &s;hrubs &s;he could obtain; and on the ground, on which his eyes were continually fixed, &s;he &s;trewed fre&s;h flowers and &s;weet-&s;cented ve|getables, that it might bear &s;ome &s;light re|&s;emblance to the earth it&s;elf in the &s;pring &s;ea&s;on. She fanned him with branches of odorous herbs; and while the air refre&s;hed him, he would &s;ometimes yield a long-drawn re&s;piration.</P>
<P>Mejnoun at fir&s;t &s;miled not, nor &s;eemed con&s;cious of the devoted tenderne&s;s of his mother. When a temporary pau&s;e of rea&s;on takes place, he con&s;iders the exi&s;ting &s;cenery as a dream, while his own lengthened dreams he con&s;iders as an exi&s;ting &s;cene. He &s;carcely yet believes he has returned to his tent; he touches his mother with curio&s;ity rather than
<PB N="113" REF="144">
with affection; and &s;lowly paces, at times, around his tent, with an inquiring eye, that &s;eems unea&s;y at an illu&s;ion. Again he re|lap&s;es into a mild delirium.</P>
<P>It is the philo&s;ophic friend, the venerable Effendi, who effects what has baffled the anxiety of maternal inquietude. Seizing all the vacillations of his un&s;teady heart, and confirming his dubious ideas, he gradually re&s;tores him. Mejnoun one day made a &s;ilent motion to open his tent. Not without alarm the anxious mother under&s;tood him, and trem|bled, as &s;he imagined it indicated his de&s;ire of again e&s;caping from home. Cautiou&s;ly &s;he opened it a little.&mdash;A little more! (exclaimed the recovering maniac in a tender tone) a little more! 'tis Paradi&s;e opening, and &s;cat|tering its balmy airs. How vivid the ver|dure! how cheering the blue &s;ky! And he gazed inten&s;ely on the face of the country, and often &s;ighed.&mdash;Rejoice! (&s;aid the Effendi to the anxious mother) thy &s;on will &s;oon be re&s;tored! The tones of his voice have re|turned
<PB N="114" REF="145">
to their natural pitch, and the fir&s;t de&s;ire of his heart is the a&s;pect of Nature. Tru&s;t me, he who loves the view of Nature, will not forget his mother!</P>
<P>One day Mejnoun fell on the neck of the Effendi, and wept over the venerable man. A deep re&s;piration laboured in his brea&s;t. He pre&s;&s;ed the hand of Lebid, and in that pre&s;&s;ure told he was con&s;cious of the pre&s;ent &s;cene, and half-remembered the pa&s;t. He fir&s;t called for his mother: he &s;unk at her feet. His father embraced him, and a father's tears filled his eyes. Beloved &s;on! (he ex|claimed) return not without an affectionate heart to thy mercile&s;s father: thy mother loved thee, and I too loved thee, yet have we acted differently! Con&s;ole me for the per&s;ecution thou ha&s;t &s;uffered; teach me to pardon my&s;elf! Thy father's heart was once a &s;oldier's; 'tis now timid as the heart of a frightened child. Look mildly on an old man, who was once thy father: de&s;pi&s;e not Ahmed in his old age. If Love has cau&s;ed
<PB N="115" REF="146">
thee all thy &s;ufferings, Love may remunerate thee with all thy joys. My &s;on, &s;mile but on me, and let me die in peace.</P>
<P>Mejnoun, in kneeling to his father, often by tender ge&s;tures interrupted the humili|ating language of affection. At length he &s;aid:&mdash;My father, it is not po&s;&s;ible! I am only re&s;tored to rea&s;on, to know all my wretchedne&s;s. Leila can never be mine. The pride of nobility has hardened the heart of the Emir. Let me quit a world in which I have cea&s;ed to be u&s;eful: tru&s;t me, I am fitted for a hermitage! I care not for the honour of my friends, and am placable to the in&s;ult of an enemy. What is a man, alike incapable of friend&s;hip or of enmity?&mdash;O, thou de&s;ert! thou un&s;hadowy wa&s;te! to me plea&s;ant is the abode of thy unrelent|ing rocks; there I view nothing of huma|nity, but the far-heard caravan, that &s;ome|times pa&s;&s;es on, like &s;ome low cloud, hang|ing heavily over the earth. Yes, my father,
<PB N="116" REF="147">
I will live without Leila, but I mu&s;t live in a de&s;ert!</P>
<P>Such was the re&s;olve of Mejnoun when recovered from his delirium; but allured by the hope of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing Leila, while every day confirmed the con&s;tancy of her heart, the de&s;ert receded from his imagination, as the world opened more pro&s;perou&s;ly. At fir&s;t his father attempted to amu&s;e his mind by continued fe&s;tivals, by the ver&s;atility of plea|&s;ure; and &s;ought to di&s;&s;ipate his pa&s;&s;ion by procuring the mo&s;t beautiful dancing wo|men. Every day he renewed his promi&s;e to apply in per&s;on to the father of Leila, while he &s;lowly prepared valuable gifts to win the obduracy of the Emir. Hope for the intem|perate Mejnoun opens another fountain of his feelings; from a delirious de&s;pair, he breaks into a delirious joy; he riots in fu|turity; his days are vowed to the fe&s;tivities of plea&s;ure, and his nights to the vi&s;ions of imagination.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="148">
He was now no more &s;urnamed MEJNOUN, but was called by his companions SERGUER|DASI, which in the Per&s;ian idiom means a Saunterer; or literally, one who does nothing but turn his head, now on one &s;ide, and now on another. His eye was now inten&s;ely fixed on the pouting lip and the circling cup, and his ear wandered in the &s;hrill joy of the pipe and the tenderne&s;s of the lute; but while his cheek glowed with animation, and the blood beat more vitally round his heart, at times his pul&s;e was irregular, and a fever breathed its unnatural heat in his veins. At the&s;e moments he compo&s;ed Anacreontics, like the following one:<Q><TEXT>

<P>At length Mejnoun murmurs at the pro|tracted happine&s;s, and &s;u&s;pects the &s;till-re|peated promi&s;e. They ob&s;erved a new change in this variable and too-&s;en&s;itive being. Sud|denly he quits his gay &s;ociety, his face is &s;uf|fu&s;ed with faint blu&s;hes, and his voice faul|ters: his eyes are again ca&s;t to the earth, his bo&s;om palpitates, he refu&s;es his meals, and, in a few weeks, a wan countenance betrays his nightly fevers. His mother, alarmed at
<PB N="121" REF="152">
the menaced change of his pa&s;&s;ions, prompts her venerable lord to the humiliation of per|&s;onal intreaty; and now, with a reluctance concealed in his own brea&s;t, the old hero ha&s;tens to the tents of the green-turbaned Emir.</P>
<P>He enters and addre&s;&s;es him:&mdash;De&s;cend|ant of Fatima! deign to unite thy en|chanting daughter with my unhappy &s;on: already ha&s;t thou heard of the long de|lirium of the wanderer. Ah! who ever loved like Mejnoun? Behold him re&s;tor|ed to glory! Plea&s;ure lights his &s;plendid cheek; his immortal voice renews the ver&s;es Arabia remembers; and all our youth call for the union of thy ro&s;e with my nightin|gale. Thou knowe&s;t the prophet has made me a fortunate man; the trees I have planted live, the fountains I have opened were never dry. To Leila I will give a hundred virgins; they are the ro&s;es of our valley. A thou&s;and armed Bedoweens, each mounted on a white cour&s;er; and five hundred camels; and two
<PB N="122" REF="153">
thou&s;and &s;hepherds; the&s;e &s;hall &s;urround her tent. My &s;oul is now meditating to depart, and in the flying hour of Fate, little to me it imports whether I die on a throne or peri&s;h in the du&s;t; but parental affection lives beyond the grave; and thou who art a father, wilt not be in&s;en&s;ible to the prayer of a father.</P>
<P>Such was the humble &s;olicitation of the magnificent veteran. But the Emir, who&s;e cheek was &s;corched, and who&s;e blood was acrid with envy, as he li&s;tened to the opu|lence of Ahmed, and who&s;e obdurate heart was puffed up by the pomp of birth, receiv|ed him with a fierce di&s;dain; tauntingly re|proached the &s;piritle&s;s father with the deli|rium of his &s;on, and with the bittere&s;t mock|ery an Arabian gives, he added&mdash;Imbecile Bedoween, &s;ee&s;t thou not that the wrong &s;ide of thy turban is out<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bedoween honour is &s;till more delicate than ours, and requires even a greater number of victims to be &s;acrificed to it.

<P><PB N="123" REF="154">
A deep groan broke from the old Ahmed; twice he &s;troked his beard, and half un&s;heath|ed his &s;cymitar; but the thought of &s;till fur|ther di&s;tre&s;&s;ing his &s;on, by the death of Lei|la's father, thwarted his ju&s;t vengeance. He quietly &s;heathed his &s;cymitar, exclaiming,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"What &s;ort of a man art thou that can&s;t be ignorant of love?"</Q> Thou, oh Prophet! ha&s;t witne&s;&s;ed all!

O, Love! thou jealous pa&s;&s;ion! that wilt not &s;uffer another to abide with thee!</P>
<P>He returned home humiliated; but, &s;tu|dious to conceal his feelings from his &s;on, this unhappy father entered his tent with a feeble &s;mile on his aged countenance. But the per&s;picacity of Mejnoun perceived the reception he had &s;uffered; and it pierced
<PB N="124" REF="155">
his &s;oul when he reflected, that the intem|perance of his pa&s;&s;ion had given di&s;honour to a venerable heroi&s;m, and for ever di&s;turbed the &s;lumbers of an old father's eyes. His &s;oul pined: he for ever abandoned the gaieties of his convivial day, and amid the lonelie&s;t &s;pots, compo&s;ed the mo&s;t touching gazels<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gazels</HI> are <HI>&s;onnets.</HI> I do not know whether they de|rive this <HI>name</HI> from the animal &s;o called, and celebrated for the tenderne&s;s of its eyes, and the gentlene&s;s and beauty of its form.</NOTE>. He now talked of returning to the de&s;ert.</P>
<P>For the la&s;t act of piety and de&s;pair, his father propo&s;ed a pilgrimage to Mecca. It was a long journey for one of his age, but he would not perform the awful function by proxy; and in the holy hou&s;e of the patri|arch Abraham, he half-hoped to li&s;ten to the cele&s;tial whi&s;perings of piteous &s;eraphs, or at the tomb of the prophet to behold &s;ome mi|racle, operating on the intellect of his &s;on.&mdash;I go (&s;aid the aged Ahmed) like the good pa|triarch with his &s;on I&s;aac: may <HI>I</HI> be the &s;acri|fice to propitiate Heaven, that has de&s;erted us!</P>

They arrive at the &s;anctuary: they repeat the numerous prayers, and perform the nu|merous ablutions, and pre&s;ent the numerous offerings: they ki&s;s the black, gold-embroi|dered &s;ilk, on the top of the &s;acred caaba; reverently they touch the golden gutters, and drink of the gelid water of the well Zem|zem, which in the arid &s;oil &s;uddenly opened for Hagar when in &s;earch of water for I&s;mael. They pace, with the enthu&s;ia&s;m of piety, along the numerous arcades, formed by tho&s;e va&s;t columns, which &s;u&s;pend a thou&s;and &s;il|ver lamps, for ever illumined, dimming the eye through the dread &s;tilne&s;s with a reli|gious light. They &s;pread their carpets, and tremblingly pro&s;trate them&s;elves before the black &s;tone which the angel Gabriel hewed from the rocks of the Cauther, who&s;e &s;tream rolls in heaven over beryl beds, and who&s;e &s;hores are gold.</P>
<P>One day Mejnoun entered the temple alone. He approached the black &s;tone, and hears from its oppo&s;ite &s;ide the voice of his

father fervently &s;upplicating Heaven, and offering his vows, that his &s;on might forget Leila.</P>
<P>Mejnoun heard, and the &s;ullenne&s;s of anger, with the ferocity of de&s;pair, glared in his di&s;tracted eyes. With a horrid impati|ence he &s;trikes his temples with his clenched hands, while his uncertain feet &s;carcely en|able him to fly. He crawls to a remote ai&s;le, and flings him&s;elf on the marble floor.&mdash;And have we come here (he cries) to form vows! Tho&s;e are not mine! How hateful is the voice of fathers! No, Leila! they &s;hall not &s;educe me! We will de&s;pair, but we will laugh at fathers. Thou &s;uffere&s;t: may&s;t thou not &s;uffer like me!

<P><PB N="127" REF="158">
At the clo&s;e of the day he &s;teals from the temple, and e&s;capes from Mecca. He gains the de&s;ert, neighbouring the tents of Leila; a wanderer in the &s;ame paths, and in the &s;ame delirium! More exanimate than for|merly, he cannot climb the precipitous rocks; but crawls and ga&s;ps along the hot briny &s;ands. Sometimes he lies &s;tretched, and fan|cies he &s;hall never again ri&s;e.

<P>But Nature, too friendly to de&s;pairing men, cea&s;es the violence of &s;ufferance, when its operations tend to annihilation.

At this &s;ilent ho&s;pitality, this vi&s;i|ble &s;ympathy, this endearment of &s;en&s;ibility, the melancholy &s;oul of Mejnoun was touched, and he wept beneath that TREE; but as he perceived that while he continued under it, the branches drooped more and more, he ro&s;e from the grateful &s;hade, le&s;t, in the ho&s;|pitality it offered, it &s;hould entirely con&s;ume its generous virtues.&mdash;Ah! others may come as wretched as my&s;elf!

He pur|&s;ues the hunter, who, &s;tartled by the man|&s;pectre, flies; but the feet of Mejnoun were winged by de&s;pair, and the &s;teps of the timid hunter relaxed as they flew.

with the delirium of holine&s;s. Thy ring is a &s;ainted relic; in adver&s;ity I will ki&s;s it; all that a Mejnoun wears, they &s;ay, is holy.

<P>He had obtained the fawn to &s;atiate the violence of appetite; but his lifted hand hav|ing rudely touched its budding horns, their exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility prompted the beautiful animal to yield a tender in&s;antine cry, which &s;poke to the heart of the melancholy man. Its &s;lender tongue licked his rai&s;ed hand, and it fixed its full eyes on its per&s;ecutor: the view of the fawn revived the memory of his con&s;tant gazel. He &s;at down and wept over

<P>I cannot omit noticing a beautiful illumination in the &s;plendid Per&s;ian manu&s;cript of Mr. Douce. Mejonoun is re|pre&s;ented &s;eated, nearly naked, and feeding a &s;potted fawn. The whole form of the maniac is &s;qualid, meagre, and fa|mine is in every limb. The antelope is highly fini&s;hed, with all tho&s;e minute and exqui&s;ite touches which di&s;tin|gui&s;h the brilliant pencil of the Per&s;ian painter. The arti&s;ts of that country excel in the human phy&s;iognomy, and the face of the Mejnoun is here pourtrayed with peculiar felicity; it is fami&s;hed and melancholy, yet the &s;ympathi&s;ing &s;mile, while it feeds the gazel, is thrown over part of the features, and may be compared to a little &s;un&s;hine illumining a dark cloud.</P></NOTE>.</P>

Thus conver&s;ed the fanciful Mejnoun with his fawn. Society not wanting in his &s;oli|tude, it renewed his gentle&s;t emotions, and a fawn could tame the de&s;perate man. To refre&s;h his fawn, he often eluded the brazen &s;ky and the thir&s;ty &s;ands, and &s;tole to the green borders of Per&s;ia, &s;tretching him&s;elf on the flowers that richly clothe that vernal &s;oil, while the fawn gamboled among the beds of tulips, anemones, and jonquils<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir John Chardin thus de&s;cribes the borders of Per&s;ia: The Mazanderan, the mo&s;t we&s;tern parts of this country, is one parterre from the month of September to the clo&s;e of April; the face of the country is covered with flowers.

<P>In this &s;econd flight to the de&s;ert his re|treat had been undi&s;covered till he met the hunter, who, ha&s;tening to Leila (for the pro|mi&s;e

The di&s;con&s;olate maiden could not re&s;i&s;t the de&s;ire of vi&s;iting her lover and her maniac, and, with a confidential &s;lave, con|trived to e&s;cape, for a &s;hort time, on hor&s;es procured in ha&s;te.</P>
<P>Arrived in the de&s;ert, they &s;oon became faint in the hot bla&s;ts.

He lives here! &s;he cried. Perhaps not (replied the &s;lave), perhaps thy portrait is engraven on every rock.</P>
<P>Three hours had elap&s;ed, and Mejnoun appeared not. The &s;lave wailed, often re|peating aloud, Unhappy Leila! A fawn ap|peared as &s;he pronounced the name. They wondered, as they heard a &s;hrill, hoar&s;e voice vociferating, Leila, Leila! The fawn di&s;ap|peared. The per&s;on who had called was in the narrow paths among the precipices, and was heard to &s;ay, What induced thee,

The wan form of Mejnoun approached; he perceives two females; he recogni&s;es Leila; he lo&s;es his voice; a quick &s;uffu&s;ion flu&s;hed and died away on his pallid countenance; a faint light gli&s;tened in his eyes; he bends on tottering knees; he would embrace Leila, but falls before her in extreme debility.</P>
<P>He creeps to her tremulou&s;ly; he gra&s;ps her knees; he ri&s;es, he pre&s;&s;es her in his arms. He re&s;ts his eyes on her face till the recovering beauty returns his glances; inar|ticulate &s;ounds murmur on their lips; and they touch and tremble.</P>
<P>Vi&s;ion of the earth! (exclaimed the deli|rious Mejnoun) can&s;t thou deceive me with &s;ub&s;tantial forms? I live on deliriou&s;ly! my life is but a protracted dream. Breathing form! ha&s;t thou not a voice? Tell me, quickly tell me, art thou indeed Leila?</P>

<P>They &s;at down; the &s;lave &s;pread the va|rious refection; con&s;i&s;ting of pomegranates, and water-melons, and pi&s;tachio nuts, and various-coloured grapes, with plates of rice and the fle&s;h of goats. She had al&s;o brought the cooling tamarinds, to expre&s;s in their be|verage; but the bardaks of water &s;he had broken in her ha&s;te, and &s;he loudly lamented the want of a &s;herbet.&mdash;Thou art the fir&s;t, luxurious girl!

<P>In their rambling conver&s;ation they made more que&s;tions than they could form an|&s;wers, and the la&s;t hour of this romantic vi&s;it was to clo&s;e. The moon &s;hone in its mid path, and the cry&s;tal light warned the &s;lave to commence their &s;hadowy journey. The lovers, reminded of the time, were alike unwilling to &s;eparate. They &s;at retired, and every time the &s;lave came to them, &s;he was remanded back; every time &s;he &s;aw the long|langui&s;hing looks their eyes mingled; but in the eyes of Leila the tears &s;uffu&s;ed their bril|liancy, and they &s;hone like moonlight in the water. At length &s;he cried,&mdash;My mi&s;tre&s;s will

<P>Rou&s;ed by the clamours of the &s;lave, Mej|noun &s;u&s;tained Leila, he looked on the moon and &s;aw it declining in its blue path.&mdash;How &s;hall I live after this! (he cried:) yet let us ha&s;te; I will conduct thee to the borders of the de&s;ert. Perfection of beauty, Peri of my &s;oul! when we again meet, I &s;hall open for thee the &s;ilver gate of Paradi&s;e!</P>
<P>They proceeded &s;lowly on their journey, till the &s;lave again exclaimed,&mdash;Ah! look, my lord! &s;he pointed to the moon; it was almo&s;t extingui&s;hed, and glided away on the verge of the &s;ky. Mejnoun reluctantly hur|ried on; and now they reached the borders of the de&s;ert, and &s;topped to take a la&s;t fare|well. The dawn already peered above the horizon with its argent whitene&s;s, and the &s;un now threw an amber-&s;treak, and was on

the point of colouring the heaven with its vermilion; part of the mountains before them had the purple hue of the half-illu|mined night-&s;hadows. They gaze on the beamle&s;s &s;un; they kneel before the &s;oul of the univer&s;e; and, cla&s;ping their hands, vow an eternal pa&s;&s;ion. Leila &s;upplicates for his return to his father's tents.&mdash;No (replied Mej|noun), I will not live where our fathers live!&mdash;Voicele&s;s they embrace, &s;lowly they part, quickly they return: now afar, they wave their hands, and Mejnoun gazed on Leila till her figure melted in the air, and &s;eemed a &s;peck to his eye.</P>
<P>Alone, after this interview, for the fir&s;t time he perceived the horrors of the de&s;ert. Habit had &s;oftened the a&s;pect of the &s;ur|rounding terrors; de&s;pair had even endcared them; but the fatal pre&s;ence of the object in which all his pa&s;&s;ions centered, again convul&s;ed the volcano of his heart. At times he thought to pur&s;ue her, to detain her, to plunge into one aby&s;s, and to find
<PB N="143" REF="174">
together an eternal re&s;t. His frame betrays the rapid volitions of his heart; fla&s;hes of heat are &s;ucceeded by chilly fits; thoughts offu&s;cate thoughts; he returns to the &s;pot whence Leila departed. He runs along the &s;ands; his voice howls and &s;hrieks; he tears up the trees by their roots, and flings them in the air; he pur&s;ues the wild animals, and &s;atiates the anger of his &s;oul in their mur|ders; he rejoices to make the de&s;ert more de&s;ert. He tears away the young laurel that jutted from his grottoed rock; once he had taught it to grow there with a little pride; it remembered him of glory. At length he &s;woons. It was only on the &s;ucceeding night that the mi&s;erable maniac awoke from his delirium; then faint, he tranquilly gazed on the tranquil moon, and care&s;&s;ed his fawn that laid its head on his knees.&mdash;Surely (he cried) it was but in a dream that I have &s;een Leila! and thus he addre&s;&s;ed the &s;awn:&mdash;Sleep by the light of the moon, fair fawn! the moonbeams will not hurt thy dark bril|liant

<L>A PAINTED DREAM is all my BLISS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following &s;onnet, or gazel, from the Divan of Jami, is given by Major Ou&s;eley in his Oriental Collections, p. 187, and from which I derived the idea of this poem:<Q><L>"La&s;t night my eyes were clo&s;ed in &s;leep, but my happi|ne&s;s awake;</L>
<L>The whole night, the live-long night, the image of my beloved was the companion of my &s;oul.</L>

<P>The curious reader will find that the ode already quoted of Anacreon, and other parts of the Teian bard, bear a great affinity with Oriental and Per&s;ian poetry. This is no place to conjecture that Anacreon (fir&s;t produced entire by Henry Stephens) was po&s;&s;ibly borrowed from the Per&s;ians.</P></NOTE>!</L>

The rock he haunted was well known to the hunters; and the gentlene&s;s of the Mejnoun had prompted them to repay the &s;weetne&s;s of his romantic &s;ongs by leaving provi&s;ions in his rocky vault: they al&s;o frequently placed there the &s;ilk paper and the &s;plendid ink of Per&s;ia, with Egyp|tian reeds.

<HEAD>PART THE FOURTH.</HEAD>
<P>NOUFEL, the Iman of Sana, was equally renowned for a pa&s;&s;ion for poetry and for hunting. Wandering one day near the rock of Mejnoun, this prince li&s;tened to his voice; he was touched by its melodious melancholy; and while the poetry indicated the un&s;teady heart of the poet, the united delirium of his art, his love, and his exile, was more inte|re&s;ting than the regular and courtly mea&s;ures that fatigued his ear in his palace.</P>
<P>Noufel &s;ilently enters into the twilight gloom of the vaulted rock. In its &s;ubdued light he views Mejnoun in a recumbent po&s;|ture: the affectionate fawn was &s;tretched before him, and a manu&s;cript was placed on its &s;oft-breathing body. Mejnoun was in
<PB N="151" REF="182">
the act of compo&s;ition: a warm radiance &s;parkled at times in his hollowed eyes, that often fixed on an oppo&s;ite portrait of Leila. His extended hand held a reed; he repeated ver&s;es till they found cadence; he gave utter|ance to ideas and to images that perplexed by their variety; his ge&s;tures accompanied the pa&s;&s;ions he de&s;cribed:&mdash;&s;uch were the deliria of reverie! Often he clo&s;ed his pe|riods with the tendere&s;t &s;igh, and with the &s;oft part of the reed often relieved his eye from the tear that clouded.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;ibility of the prince never &s;lum|bered: he feared to ru&s;h too abruptly in the pre&s;ence of a man who&s;e tremulous nerves &s;uffered &s;uch a fine irritability. He &s;tole away, gliding on tiptoe, from the vault. Reaching its entrance, he inquired of his hunters, if they knew who was the Mejnoun who haunted this &s;pot?&mdash;It is the lover of Leila.&mdash;And is the fine&s;t poet of Arabia left to peri&s;h in &s;olitude! (cried Noufel.) Men
<PB N="152" REF="183">
of genius! it is thus ye are admired and never con&s;oled!</P>
<P>He bid a hunter blow his horn; but to blow it with a &s;ound &s;o mellow that it &s;hould fall, like a remote harmony, on the ear of Mejnoun. He blew, and the tones played lightly among the circling echoes. Mej|noun appeared. Noufel approached him, and taking his hand, &s;miling, &s;aid:&mdash;En|chanting poet, eternal lover! behold Nou|fel! Me, perhaps, thou knowe&s;t not, for I am but a prince; but thou art known to me, for thou art a poet. My &s;ubjects cheri&s;h me, but of thee the world is enamoured. Wilt thou deign to accept my protection? Leila &s;hall be thine; I &s;wear by Alborak, on which the prophet rode to heaven! Is the Emir avaricious? I will offer him trea&s;ures. Ambitious? I will give thee dignities. In|&s;en&s;ible to kindne&s;s? My troops have taught de&s;pots to feel. Yes, thou &s;halt have Leila; and all that I implore of thee is to embelli&s;h
<PB N="153" REF="184">
my court with thy glory. Delight us with the graces of thy &s;plendid ver&s;e; in&s;truct us by the wi&s;dom of thy &s;olemn precept.</P>
<P>Mejnoun &s;earched, with an inquiring eye, the face of the Iman; his phy&s;iognomy had every waving tender line of &s;en&s;ibility; and as their eyes met, they under&s;tood each other. The hope of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing Leila exhilarated his a&s;toni&s;hed &s;oul, and he replied:&mdash;Thy offer is pure; who but the gentle&s;t of men would court a hermit? Thy amiable &s;oul opens it|&s;elf to love and poetry. Thou give&s;t me HOPE; it is a &s;weet aliment to a wounded &s;pirit. Yet HOPE was once my para&s;ite, and flattered, and revelled, and ruined! Yet HOPE is &s;till dear; it is &s;o &s;trange to my feelings; it is a &s;en&s;ation &s;o long forgotten, that &s;carcely my feeble heart knows how to receive it.</P>
<P>The enthu&s;ia&s;t, now at the court of Nou|fel, received from the &s;en&s;itive prince new honours every day. He ordered that a <HI>me|dalla,</HI> or large para&s;ol, &s;hould be ever carried
<PB N="154" REF="185">
before him; the di&s;tinction of independent nobility. He prepares an emba&s;&s;y for the Emir, and compo&s;es the letter him&s;elf, in which he invited his con&s;ent by the muni|ficence of his offers, and menaced his refu&s;al by the terror of his arms.</P>
<P>The haughty Emir tore the letter before the face of the amba&s;&s;ador, violently &s;tamped on the fragments, and &s;arca&s;tically congratu|lated him on the wi&s;dom of his prince, who propo&s;ed creating a di&s;tracted lover his chief mini&s;ter. The Emir &s;ummons his tribe; Nou&s;el collects his bands. At length they meet, and, pau&s;ing ere they combat, watch the motions of each other.</P>
<P>Mejnoun, two days preceding the battle, di&s;patched a tru&s;ty page to the camp of the Emir. He has orders to enter &s;ecretly the tent of Leila, and to prevail on her to fly with him, that a battle might be &s;pared. The page pur&s;ues his way with the devoted zeal of a me&s;&s;enger of love. He travels by moonlight, through unbeaten paths: when
<PB N="155" REF="186">
he meets a &s;tream, he &s;wims acro&s;s it; a precipice, he leaps over it; a hill, he runs up it; and along the &s;mooth valley he trips &s;o lightly, that at morning his &s;andals are &s;carcely wet, and faintly &s;ilvered over by the night-dews. He approaches the camp of the enemy, and ob&s;erved the armed Arabs &s;leep|ing in the moonlight. He dexterou&s;ly &s;huns the centinels, by creeping under hedges, and often hiding his little body among the tall gra&s;s and fringed fern, he reaches the tent of Leila. Gliding in, he views at the far|end, the beauty by a &s;olitary lamp, and the holy koran lying before her, on which &s;ome|times &s;he directed her unquiet eyes. The little page is at a lo&s;s how to di&s;cover him|&s;elf. He folds his hands on his brea&s;t, and kneels; Leila fancies, in the delirium of pi|ety, that the beautiful boy is &s;ome winged genii, of whom &s;he had read in the Per&s;ian tales. She recovers her under&s;tanding in li&s;|tening to the me&s;&s;age. The little page tells her, how he had &s;wam acro&s;s &s;treams, leaped
<PB N="156" REF="187">
over precipices, run up hills, and crept un|&s;een in the tall gra&s;s.&mdash;I cannot do all this (&s;aid Leila): it is only a little boy like thy|&s;elf who can be &s;o &s;ecret a traveller. Surely thy beloved lord is &s;till a Mejnoun!</P>
<P>At length, after a week had elap&s;ed in ex|treme wearine&s;s, and they had watched in|ce&s;&s;antly the motions of each other, the combat commenced. The army of Noufel amounted to a thou&s;and hor&s;emen, that of the Emir was inferior; and they joined with equal valour, but unequal force. They &s;truck &s;abres again&s;t &s;abres; couched their long lances, and pointed them at, without touch|ing each other's brea&s;ts; they wheeled about each other with equal celerity; they uttered loud and &s;hrill vociferations; &s;tood with menacing ge&s;tures, and tried each other's &s;agacity by artful feints: &s;ometimes they mingled with an apparent rage, now pur&s;u|ing and now flying, as the vigour of their arm prevailed. Clouds of du&s;t were rolled above and around. They combated in this
<PB N="157" REF="188">
manner for twelve hours, till the troops of the Emir left on the field of battle &s;even of their companions, who lay motionle&s;s, brui&s;ed by the fall from their hor&s;es. The route then became general; a panic was caught by the Emir's &s;oldiery; and the army of Nou&s;el proved victorious by out-wearying their ene|mies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this manner are the bloodle&s;s combats of the Arabs, which appear &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the ancient Condottieri of Italy, where a whole day was fought, and a &s;ingle &s;oldier wounded, often decided the fortune of the day. Niebuhr ob&s;erves, that an army of a thou&s;and Arabs will take to flight and think them&s;elves routed if they lo&s;e but &s;even or eight of their number. Pag&eacute;s, in his travels, exhibits a very entertaining narrative of &s;uch an engagement: after a run|ning fight the whole day, on one &s;ide none were killed or wounded, while the&s;e boa&s;ted of a triumph for having killed no more than one man, and &s;ome camels.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The tent of the Emir was &s;urrounded; and Mejnoun yielding the honour of fir&s;t entering it to his patron, the prince took pri|&s;oner the Emir and his daughter. Touched by the beauty of the virgin, he gazes in &s;ilent admiration, and thinks that even Mejnoun had not &s;ufficiently in&s;pired his imagination
<PB N="158" REF="189">
with &s;uch a model of beauty. The haughty father &s;tood be&s;ide her, nor relinqui&s;hed the hand of his daughter till the prince, in gently &s;eparating them, claimed the right of con|que&s;t. Fear, mode&s;ty, and grief, were ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the variable face of Leila, in tears, in blu&s;hes, and in tremors. At the view of &s;o much beauty (more beautiful in its di&s;|order) the feeling &s;oul of Noufel in&s;pired his fir&s;t action with magnanimity.&mdash;Lovely maiden! (he cried) fear not a conqueror who conquers but to re&s;tore thee to freedom, to love, and to Mejnoun. For thee, obdurate Emir! in thy misfortune we forget thy pride. Return to thy tents.&mdash;The friends of the Emir kneeled to Noufel. The imperious Emir him&s;elf was no more proud; his hereditary &s;pirit melted away in tenderne&s;s, as his humid eyes re&s;ted on his daughter. They embraced and wept; and as he quitted her arms with a paternal &s;igh, Leila looked on Mejnoun with anger and with grief. Her lover felt the &s;ilent indignation, nor ventured
<PB N="159" REF="190">
to approach her: the victor &s;tood half-mourn|ing his victory.</P>
<P>The character of Noufel was that of a quick &s;u&s;ceptibility, and the impul&s;ion of his feelings was in&s;tantaneous; but he was vain and volatile, and ever touching the extreme of pa&s;&s;ion. His heroi&s;m was but a tempo|rary ebullition; and that &s;u&s;ceptibility which produced his virtues, at times, taking an op|po&s;ite direction, hurried him into impetuous crimes; crimes which he could at once abhor and cheri&s;h: in a word, his heart was more ardent than intrepid. His natural feel|ings were pure, but they were at variance with the acquired habits of a court; and he was rather a lover of virtue, than virtuous.</P>
<P>The emotions with which Leila affected him, were too powerful for a &s;oul who&s;e ex|treme &s;oftne&s;s is only the more dangerous when it tends to a gradual corruption. At fir&s;t he faintly wre&s;tled with his de&s;ires; but as the mind of Leila calmed, every day &s;he became le&s;s re&s;i&s;tible; and he gazed while
<PB N="160" REF="191">
his whole frame trembled at the novel graces every day &s;hot forth to his eye; at the har|mony of her features, the bloom of her com|plexion, and the enchantment diffu&s;ed over her whole per&s;on. The tender friend&s;hip &s;he felt for the patron of her lover, but the more provoked his ardour; his &s;oul was in|flamed by her graceful &s;mile, and di&s;&s;olved by her intendering tones; and while he li&s;|tened, ab&s;orbed in the melody of her tongue, if he looked up to her eyes, he forgot her voice in their brilliancy. Unhappy Noufel! he felt him&s;elf at length &s;o much attached to her, that he now con&s;idered that her lover intruded on <HI>his</HI> claims, and at the affection|ate care&s;&s;es of Mejnoun, he writhed in the agony of jealou&s;y. How often &s;uddenly he quitted them, &s;ickening at their happine&s;s, while they, with grateful eyes, thanked him for that hour of delicious &s;olitude which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the exi&s;tence of lovers.&mdash;What! (cried the mi&s;erable prince,) &s;hall <HI>I</HI> be the &s;lave of Mejnoun? Shall I yield the only
<PB N="161" REF="192">
happine&s;s I have ever found to the &s;olitary hand of a di&s;tracted man? Yes; friend&s;hip, ju&s;tice, and ho&s;pitality, tell me this. And what are ye all, ye &s;oft-heated VIRTUES, be|fore the energy of POWER? Shall Noufel be the mo&s;t wretched in his court? &s;hall he make madmen happy, by rendering him&s;elf mo&s;t unhappy? If this be virtue, it is al&s;o folly. A word annihilates Mejnoun; a word for ever unites me to Leila. What! they will call me an impious bread and &s;alt trai|tor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A bread and &s;alt traitor (he who betrays his ho&s;t or patron) is one of the mo&s;t opprobrious epithets by which one A&s;iatic can expre&s;s his dete&s;tation of another.

I &s;hall violate the rights of ho&s;pita|lity; the holy rights an Arabian reveres. Ah! what are <HI>rights</HI> to <HI>me</HI>&mdash;a lover and a prince! Noufel was not in&s;en&s;ible to his own unwor|thine&s;s, and the pang of guilt was redoubled as he felt the in&s;amy of guilt. Sometimes he re&s;olves to have Mejnoun a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, but the diminution of his fame re&s;trained him;
<PB N="162" REF="193">
and he watches with perpetual &s;olicitude, if he could di&s;cover &s;ome action in Mejnoun that might prove the di&s;order of his mind, and the nece&s;&s;ity of confinement; but the intellect of Mejnoun was never injured but when he was torn away from Leila. At length Mejnoun complained in gentlene&s;s, to Noufel, of his protracted happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Noufel fixes on the day of his marriage. He announces to the court, that Mejnoun on that day becomes his chief mini&s;ter; and to give publicity to his honours, he com|mands a nightly illumination in the city of Sana, to precede the &s;plendid banquet which is to &s;olemni&s;e the happine&s;s of Mejnoun and Leila.</P>
<P>The public fe&s;tivities commenced. Mej|noun compo&s;ed his epithalamiums, and the&s;e were &s;oon retained by the people, who quit|ted all their occupations, and for a whole week only &s;tudied to get by heart his ver&s;es. At the corners of the &s;treets were little knots of jugglers, tumblers, dancers, and mu&s;i|cians;
<PB N="163" REF="194">
while before the &s;hops were placed on tables, &s;pread with aromatic flowers, py|ramids of refre&s;hments, with large jars of &s;orbet, and pomegranate wine. The various crafts were the whole day wandering in pro|ce&s;&s;ions; carrying before them &s;treamers, dazzling the eye with a thou&s;and colours, and exhibiting the implements of their pro|fe&s;&s;ions in ma&s;&s;y gold; while attended by their mu&s;icians, with kettle-drums, fifes, and clarions, they &s;topped under the balcony of Mejnoun and Leila, and &s;ang hymeneal ver|&s;es, to&s;&s;ing handfuls of flowers in the air. At night the illumination was general, and the darke&s;t nook of the city &s;eemed to be lighted up by a midnight &s;un. Every minareh was wreathed with variegated lights; in the va&s;t concaves of their domes &s;hone a thou&s;and lamps of coloured gla&s;s; and cords were thrown acro&s;s, from minareh to minareh, on which the lamps were arranged into letters, forming ver&s;es of the koran; and on that night &s;o general was the fanciful illumina|tion,

Within each of the&s;e, the va&s;t concaves of the domes are lighted up by &s;ome hundred lamps of coloured gla&s;s. The lamps are fan|ta&s;tically di&s;po&s;ed in letters and figures. I was not more agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed by any thing I &s;aw in Con&s;tantinople, than the whole appearance of the fir&s;t night in Rammezan.&mdash;Dallaway's Con&s;tantinople, p. 82.</P>
<P>In the Per&s;ian Tales mention is made of an illumination which was formed of the&s;e letters, and were really ver&s;es from the koran; and perhaps what might appear as <Q REND="inline">"fanta&s;tic figures"</Q> to Mr. Dallaway, were in reality &s;uch ver&s;es.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The &s;ucceeding day the banquet is pre|pared. Leila comes forth in her bridal ve&s;t|ments, and ere the &s;olemn rite is performed, they partake of the &s;plendid refection. The artificial Noufel has entru&s;ted to his confi|dential page the infu&s;ion of a &s;ubtile poi&s;on in the wine of Mejnoun. Noufel drinks to the health of the lovers, while the page pre|&s;ents a foaming goblet to Mejnoun. Noufel keeps his eye on <HI>him</HI> who <HI>thinks</HI> him&s;elf a bridegroom; and in tran&s;port he beholds
<PB N="165" REF="196">
Mejnoun empty, without taking the goblet from his lips. To conceal the &s;ecret plea|&s;ure of his heart, his tongue is voluble; his eye, at times, &s;eems convul&s;ed with rap|ture; an agony of delight writhes his fea|tures. The courtiers around (the wretched mimics of their prince) catch the gay extra|vagance of their ma&s;ter. The pavilion &s;ounds with one undi&s;tingui&s;hed cla&s;h of voices. It was a delight that had terror in it. The prince laughs till his voice &s;hrieks; he moves on his &s;opha till every limb trembles; each courtier imitates the contortions of his rap|ture. What he &s;peaks is no more heard in the clamour of their joys. At length they behold him fall from his &s;opha, lifele&s;s, on the ground. All is the &s;ilence of terror.</P>
<P>Mejnoun flies to his friend and his prince: he holds him in his arms. The face of Nou|fel is blanched and livid; his heavy lids are clo&s;ed in death; and his feeble accents, fleet|ing on his quivering lips, painfully tell,&mdash;Mejnoun, yield me no pity! the poi&s;oned
<PB N="166" REF="197">
cup, meant for thee, has reached my own lips. I loved Leila, and my love was terri|ble, impious! I prepared poi&s;on for my gue&s;t! Yes, thy prince was thy traitor. He &s;unk into his arms, and expired in the &s;low agonies of a convul&s;ion.</P>
<P>An event &s;o unexpected and terrific in|terrupted the nuptials. The Iman, who on that very day &s;ucceeded Noufel, had none of the &s;en&s;ibility of that mi&s;erable victim of pa&s;|&s;ion. He had no attachment to poetry and to love, but a great &s;agacity in politics; and lamenting that a war &s;hould ever have been occa&s;ioned for a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;o little valuable as that of a woman, &s;ent Leila back to the Emir, with an a&s;&s;urance of his veneration for one who wore a green turban.</P>
<P>Unhappy lovers! what now but a hope|le&s;s futurity opens to your exi&s;tence? Think|ing of all ye were to be, how bitter the me|ditation of what ye are; while the remem|brance of perjured and of peri&s;hed friend|&s;hip wounds beyond the grave of the traitor!
<PB N="167" REF="198">
&mdash;My &s;oul (cried Mejnoun) ye&s;terday rejoic|ed in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and to day is de&s;olated in ruin! My happine&s;s will not la&s;t out a &s;oli|tary &s;un. FORTUNE effaces TO DAY what YESTERDAY &s;he had written on her white&s;t page!</P>
<P>Leila returned to the tents of her father, and Mejnoun relap&s;ed into his former deli|rious feeling, but with a more deadly hatred of man; and without a friend, he regards him&s;elf as a naked &s;word without a &s;heath<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline">"Far removed from friends, poor and &s;olitary, like a naked &s;word without a &s;heath."</Q>&mdash;Richard&s;on's Arabic Grammar.</P></NOTE>. Again he flies into the de&s;ert, and no one can di&s;cover his retreat.</P>
<P>It was &s;ome time after the return of his daughter that the Emir received a propo&s;al of marriage from another Emir for his &s;on Ebn&s;elan. The pa&s;&s;ion of Leila was indeed univer&s;ally known; but &s;ince this la&s;t fatal event, and the death of Mejnoun, as it was reported, it was imagined that the beautiful
<PB N="168" REF="199">
virgin would not re&s;i&s;t the pa&s;&s;ion of a youth who came recommended by the graces of his per&s;on and the &s;plendor of his train. Such was the judgment of the two aged Emirs, while the fervors of the gentle Ebn&s;elan, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion had been in&s;pired by the ver&s;es of his rival, prompted the hope of &s;till win|ning the affections of one &s;o capable of af|fection.</P>
<P>But when Leila was acquainted with the re&s;olves of her father, &s;he &s;hrieked, &s;he tore the rich calpuc from her hair, and beating her bo&s;om, accu&s;ed her parents of cruelty, and Heaven of inju&s;tice. By gentle in&s;inu|ations, and by mild reproaches, they e&s;&s;ayed all the avenues of her &s;u&s;ceptible heart. She was a&s;&s;ured that Mejnoun had cea&s;ed to exi&s;t; and was &s;he not &s;olicited by the mo&s;t amiable youth in Yemen? and was the &s;o|lemn oath of her venerable father to be lightly regarded? Had he not &s;worn, that if &s;he ac|cepted not the hand of Ebn&s;elan, no hope remaining to perpetuate his family honours,
<PB N="169" REF="200">
he would refu&s;e nouri&s;hment, and clo&s;e his days by a voluntary death?&mdash;Thou ha&s;t di&s;|graced us! (he cried:) a childle&s;s woman is in our race. Virginity is the glory of the girl, but the &s;hame of the woman. Thou ha&s;t turned into a de&s;ert the fertile &s;oil, and dried up the fountain of our race.</P>
<P>Long inexorable, the &s;ufferer offered her life, but refu&s;ed her hand. Day &s;ucceeded day, and no me&s;&s;enger from Mejnoun ar|rived. Her father per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;olution, and cea&s;ele&s;s tears were on the face of her mother.

<P>Approach me not (again exclaimed the alarmed Leila), ra&s;h youth! the ro&s;e thou would&s;t pluck will rai&s;e its viewle&s;s thorns again&s;t thee. I am the &s;lave of a man for|lorn; one who is now perhaps the night|companion of the hyaena, and who ga&s;ps with thir&s;t where there are no waters.

<P>Ebn&s;elan was the mild inmate of a mild climate. He had merited Leila, had Leila to choo&s;e a lover.

<P>Mejnoun, after a long re&s;idence in the ruins, among which he had concealed him|&s;elf, would &s;ometimes &s;troll into the open de&s;ert, and met the traveller. The news of the marriage reached him. The pilgrim

At fir&s;t, the incredulous Mejnoun conceived the tale to be an artifice to with|draw him from his retreat, and often deemed it was a wild notion of his own di&s;ordered imagination. Day followed day, and the circum&s;tantial narrative, in all its terrible minutene&s;s, &s;till afflicted his memory. Jea|lou&s;y and indignation exalted his delirium. He knows nothing of the trials of Leila; of that re&s;i&s;tle&s;s per&s;ecution, when a &s;ilent pa|rent peri&s;hes before the eye of filial piety; and &s;till le&s;s of her inviolate affection, and the not inferior &s;ufferings of Ebn&s;elan.

<P>It will not avail to tell thee <HI>how</HI> I became the wife of another! An unju&s;t father re|proached me; a heart-broken mother &s;at be&s;ide me; an amiable youth prayed to me.

<P>This epi&s;tle gave to Mejnoun the emo|tions of de&s;ponding con&s;tancy. In the deli|rium of pa&s;&s;ion each period received a tear and &s;ometimes a ki&s;s, and gra&s;ping the letter till every &s;yllable was effaced, he held the fragments to his eyes while his memory &s;up|plied the pa&s;&s;ages he could no more di&s;tin|gui&s;h.</P>
<P>Often the tender maniac addre&s;&s;ed the echo, and often a&s;ked, who was the mo&s;t
<PB N="190" REF="221">
unfortunate, him&s;elf or his mi&s;tre&s;s? while often he hated the voice of the echo, becau&s;e it was his own voice.&mdash;Deceitful &s;ympathy! (he cried,) thou replie&s;t to my &s;ighs, thou repeate&s;t my words, and what art thou but air? Hollow is thy heart, and mockery is in thy voice; and yet to the &s;olitary how con&s;oling even the &s;hadow of the human voice! The &s;en&s;e of Leila's &s;ufferings &s;eemed to tranquillize his own, and he pau&s;ed in the violence of his own emotions while he re|membered tho&s;e of his mi&s;tre&s;s. Softened into a &s;till melancholy, he flew into an ob|&s;cure nook; pale and haggard, there &s;itting whole days immovable, he would have &s;eem|ed a &s;tatue, had he not &s;ighed.</P>
<P>His abode was now not unknown, and many a me&s;&s;enger had come from his father, imploring his return. But Mejnoun was in|exorable. The old Chief, amid&s;t his tents, felt him&s;elf as de&s;olated as his hermit &s;on; the fond hope of po&s;terity, that &s;olitary hope of age, was extinct; another victim to the&s;e
<PB N="191" REF="222">
unhappy loves, his noble and paternal heart was broken. In the chill of approaching death, the &s;olitary idea which occupied his clo&s;ing hours was the de&s;ire of once more embracing his mi&s;erable &s;on. Who but Lebid could prevail with Mejnoun? yet the journey might be fatal to the venerable man. The dying Chief &s;oftly gra&s;ped the hand of his friend, and looked in his face, and was &s;ilent; he &s;u&s;pired the name of Mejnoun in a &s;igh half &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. Lebid that day or|dered a camel, and departed for the hermit.</P>
<P>He di&s;covered his dark cavern. He lay there &s;tretched without motion, and in the twilight gloom, the Effendi imagines he views his corp&s;e. He rai&s;ed a loud cry; as Mejnoun ro&s;e he embraced him.</P>
<P>Thou live&s;t yet! (cried the old tremulous man;) thy father peri&s;hes! His &s;oul &s;trug|gles to live a day, that he may yet once more view thee. Is the tendere&s;t pa&s;&s;ion to di&s;|nature thy brea&s;t? My&s;terious Heaven! per|mitte&s;t thou two human beings to love like
<PB N="192" REF="223">
the&s;e?&mdash;Mejnoun! my friend, my child, &s;peak! Thy father, thou knowe&s;t not he has been a father to thee; tru&s;t me, thou knowe&s;t not all. Ha&s;ten, and be the vi&s;ion of his death-bed! Mi&s;erable man! I only invite thee to the &s;cene of death! Come, thy cheri&s;hed hand may yet clo&s;e his heavy eyes in &s;weetne&s;s.</P>
<P>Mejnoun gazed on Lebid with leaden and &s;piritle&s;s eyes; he fondly li&s;tened to him, and quietly followed him. Tears and em|braces they exchanged, but words they could not utter.</P>
<P>They journeyed on, till the exhau&s;ted Ef|fendi could not proceed. He hung his &s;hri|velled arms around the neck of Mejnoun; his feeble tones died in murmurs on his lips.&mdash;Proceed! thy father has not many hours to live! Lay me under this plane-tree: I &s;hall be found; fear not! It is better for me to die under that plane-tree, than be carried home lifele&s;s. It will &s;pare our friends &s;ome &s;orrows; the death of a friend
<PB N="193" REF="224">
is &s;oon forgotten, but the view of his corp&s;e long &s;tartles the memory. Go, my child, remember thou ha&s;t a mother &s;till, when thy father dies.</P>
<P>The di&s;tracted Mejnoun in vain offers to quit the camel, and to ha&s;ten on foot to his tents: but this would have prolonged his journey many days. The old Effendi was now &s;peechle&s;s; the camel would not go without its driver; the moments pre&s;&s;ed on him.&mdash;Shall I leave a dying father here, to ha&s;ten to a father who is perhaps dead? exclaimed the mi&s;erable man. But he thought of his mother; he remembered the Effendi's words; and &s;tretching the old man under the plane-tree, he placed be&s;ide him a bardak of water, and he journeyed, wail|ing, along the de&s;ert.</P>
<P>He reaches his tents: he flies to that of his father: he yet lives! His eyes, half|clo&s;ed in the &s;leep of death, yet open; on his icy lips his voice yet trembles; in the
<PB N="194" REF="225">
arms of his &s;on a new warmth &s;tays his fleet|ing exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>They look on each other a thou&s;and &s;ilent things. Mejnoun, as he was turned to his dying father, &s;upported his head; his mo|ther, &s;eated on the couch, laid her face on the back of her &s;on, and moaned.&mdash;My fa|ther! cried Mejnoun, and could &s;ay no more.&mdash;My &s;on! (hollowly replied the father,) let me <HI>touch</HI> thee, I have cea&s;ed to <HI>&s;ee!</HI></P>
<P>I had much to &s;ay to thee; (continued, with difficulty, the dying man; the hectic of death faintly gleamed on his face&mdash;it came, it pa&s;t!) I have not &s;een thee two years, and thou ha&s;t come a day too late: thy mother knows what I would &s;ay. Mejnoun turned to his mother; her face was rai&s;ed to him covered with tears, and &s;carcely knowing what he did, he pa&s;&s;ed his hand over her face and wiped away her tears.&mdash;May Alla pre&s;erve (continued the dying man, in tones &s;till fee|bler) from di&s;a&s;trous love the virtuous and
<PB N="195" REF="226">
the valiant! O, my &s;on! behold us alike its victims! He laid his head on the arm of his &s;on, and expired.</P>
<P>Mejnoun turns to his lifele&s;s parent, and &s;till tries to recal the voice he can hear no more. He lifts his arm, and it is &s;tiffened; he feels his hand, and no pul&s;es tremble there; he touches his blue lips, and they are as ice; his whole body remained in heavi|ne&s;s, cold in his embrace.</P>
<P>When his parent cea&s;ed to exi&s;t, he heard of all the proofs and &s;ufferings of his affec|tions; but his heart was wrung with that &s;evere&s;t of all agonies; that, which the mo&s;t affectionate &s;on feels when <HI>he</HI> has broken the heart of the tendere&s;t parent: even Leila was bani&s;hed from his thoughts.&mdash;And why (cried Mejnoun) is the goodne&s;s of man known only when it avails not to be known? I cea&s;ed to be a &s;on, becau&s;e I knew not I had a father. Heaven! how my&s;terious are thy decrees!</P>
<P>Alas! (replied his mother) thou did&s;t
<PB N="196" REF="227">
cea&s;e to be every thing when thou wert only a lover!</P>
<P>He di&s;patched two me&s;&s;engers; one to &s;earch for Lebid, the other to bring news from Leila.</P>
<P>The Effendi had been a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the cha|rity of a hermit dervi&s;e, who in vain intreated him to retire within his cave, and &s;hare his meal and his ori&s;ons. No (replied the old man), I will not quit this plane-tree; tho&s;e that left me here, will one day return to find me: I have friends, holy man, who will not forget me. The dervi&s;e who had never known &s;uch friends, imagined that the feeble old man was crazed with &s;orrow; and every day as he brought him refre&s;hments, and &s;till found him there, &s;miled and &s;aid&mdash;Tru&s;t me, no one remembers a friend in a de&s;ert.&mdash;If that be true (replied the Effendi), it were be&s;t that I &s;hould die under this plane-tree. Every day the old Effendi watched, and the me&s;&s;enger found him waiting his coming under the plane-tree.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="228">
To the wi&s;dom of Lebid Mejnoun con|fided the care of his mother and his tribe. His mind had now become a&s;&s;ociated to the de&s;ert; his delirium found repo&s;e amid fa|miliar horrors; and he once more returns to his &s;eclu&s;ion, where he appointed an in|terview with the friend he had &s;ent to the tents of Leila.</P>
<P>Day after day elap&s;ed, and &s;till no me&s;&s;en|ger from Leila arrived. He &s;at upon the point of a rock that he might di&s;cover the expect|ed friend before he reached him. At length he de&s;cries one approaching; he ran down the rock and met him on the plain. It was his friend, who when he perceived Mejnoun, approached him with &s;low &s;teps and heavy looks. The heart of Mejnoun was chilled at the a&s;pect of &s;o melancholy a me&s;&s;enger, and, with a bewildered air, he inquires the fate of Leila? His friend replied but by a profound &s;igh.&mdash;Thy &s;ilence well becomes thy tale (&s;aid Mejnoun); why is not all for me an eternal &s;ilence! Here I have waited,
<PB N="198" REF="229">
day after day, but to hear of the death of Leila. Could that heart, that tender heart, love as &s;he loved, and live? A thou&s;and times already have I mourned her death; and when the world told me &s;he yet lived, often I was incredulous.</P>
<P>Alas! (replied the friend, rejoicing to ob|&s;erve the calmne&s;s with which the Mejnoun &s;poke) a fixed grief preyed on her &s;oul, and&mdash;</P>
<P>Talk not, talk not! (quickly the Mejnoun replied, with eyes that emitted &s;parks of pa&s;|&s;ion, while his hand rudely repul&s;ed his friend;) did I not commend thy &s;ilence? Away! it is dangerous to commend a fool's &s;ilence; he will &s;peak at la&s;t, were it but to give a fool's thanks. Away! I am &s;ick of all foolery: away to thy world! to thy world, fool!</P>
<P>He pau&s;ed: his troubled heart was bu&s;ied with gloomy imaginations; his rapid lips muttered low and inarticulate accents; his eyes were fixed on the earth; he &s;ighed and
<PB N="199" REF="230">
&s;aid:&mdash;It is completed! it <HI>was</HI> born, and it <HI>has</HI> died! The flower is gathered; let the leaves, the lovely &s;tem &s;upported, fall and rot on the earth!&mdash;He mu&s;ed; terrible thoughts were in his mind, and the blood &s;or&s;ook his face.</P>
<P>He &s;hrieks, he rolls him&s;elf on the burn|ing &s;ands; his friend approaches and would embrace him; but he hurls him to the earth: he flies up the perpendicular rock. He howls, and the echo multiplies his ter|rific voice. Some hunters join his friend. Three days they patiently watch at the foot of the rock. On the &s;econd day the voice of Mejnoun was only heard at intervals: on the third night, in the gleam of the moon, they perceived the &s;pectre-man de&s;cending. The dying form paced, &s;lowly, with tottering &s;teps; every &s;tep was audible in the va&s;t &s;ilence. Their hearts &s;huddered. The Mej|noun looked not of this earth, and they dared not approach him. He reached a hillock of &s;and, and &s;tretched him&s;elf in &s;ilence. They
<PB N="200" REF="231">
ha&s;ten to the Mejnoun: on his murmuring lips they li&s;tened to the name of Leila; and &s;lowly, and hollowly, they heard one va&s;t and feeble &s;igh, and it cea&s;ed to re&s;pire. His friend placed his hand on the bo&s;om of the Mejnoun, and his heart no more palpitated.</P>
<P>The la&s;t &s;olemn office of friend&s;hip was paid by the hands of his unhappy friend and the grieving hunters. Returning to the tents of Ebn&s;elan, he &s;ummons the tribe, and tells a tale, often interrupted by his moaning auditors. Even the obdurate Emir, in who&s;e &s;ubdued brea&s;t no human pa&s;&s;ion now beat but that of pity, vows a long, &s;ad pilgrimage to Mecca, and thanks the prophet that he is old and will &s;oon die. The gentle Ebn&s;elan ro&s;e, and wept, and &s;poke:&mdash;Sad me&s;&s;enger of di&s;a&s;trous love! Another, and a final duty, &s;till remains. Thou knowe&s;t not that the dying Leila predicted the death of Mej|noun. He lives, &s;he &s;aid, but becau&s;e I live; and he will die becau&s;e I &s;hall have died. It was her la&s;t prayer, that their a&s;hes &s;hould
<PB N="201" REF="232">
be united. Lead us to his grave: they &s;hall meet, though they meet in death; and over their extinct a&s;hes let me pour my living tears.</P>
<P>The tribe of Mejnoun unite with the tribe of Leila. At the foot of the rock, which the Mejnoun haunted in his delirium, they rai&s;e a tomb to the memory of the lovers, and there depo&s;iting the bodies, they plant around many a gloomy cypre&s;s tree. Lebid lived to compo&s;e the ver&s;es, which were embo&s;&s;ed with golden characters on the black marble. Lebid lived to lament his own fo&s;tering of their loves, Ahmed's au&s;terity, and the Emir's haughtine&s;s.</P>
<P>For many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years the dam&s;els of the two tribes, in &s;ympathi&s;ing groupes, an|nually a&s;&s;embled at the cemetery, and plant|ed in marble va&s;es, around the tomb, aro|matic flowers and herbs. One night in every year, each bearing a taper, they wailed till the morning the fate of the lovers, and, in parting, prayed their PARENTS to be
<PB N="202" REF="233">
MERCIFUL IN LOVE. The caravans of Syria and Egypt, which traver&s;e the de&s;ert in their way to Mecca, once &s;topped near the con&s;e|crated &s;pot; the tender pilgrim once leant over their tomb, and read and wept. The &s;pot is now only known by tradition. The monument has left no ve&s;tige, and the trees no more wave their melancholy boughs; nothing remains but THE HISTORY OF THE LOVERS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Turks have a great veneration for the dead. Their cemeteries are &s;urrounded with a cypre&s;s grove, and in&s;crip|tions, with appropriate ver&s;es, embo&s;&s;ed with rai&s;ed letters, gilded and contra&s;ted by a black or green ground; a &s;tone che&s;t is placed between them, filled with aromatic flowers and herbs, which are planted there, and regularly cultivated by the females of the family, who a&s;&s;emble in groupes for that duty. This mark of re&s;pect is particularly &s;hewn to the dead unmarried young. It is of the highe&s;t antiquity among&s;t the poli&s;hed and the ruder nations; and &s;urely none can be more elegant and appropriate.&mdash;Dallaway's Con&s;tan|tinople, p. 152.</P>
<P>I conclude the&s;e notes by ob&s;erving, that the cata&s;trophe of this Romance has nothing in it extraordinary or violent to the ardent feelings of an Oriental lover. Richard&s;on has ob&s;erved, that the Arabians and the Tartars, by their attach|ment to pa&s;toral life, ever favourable to love, and the cir|cum&s;tances peculiar to their roving habits, frequently pro|duce &s;uch &s;ituations. Many tribes are often encamped to|gether, and the young men of one fall naturally in love with the dam&s;els of another. In the mid&s;t of their court&s;hip the heads of the tribes &s;uddenly order the tents to be &s;truck; one goes to the right hand, and one to the left. The lovers are thus &s;eparated, perhaps never more to meet; and if we may at all tru&s;t to their elegies or their language, tho&s;e &s;epa|rations have been often fatal. <HI>Dying for love</HI> is con&s;idered among&s;t us as a mere poetic figure; but in ea&s;tern countries it is &s;omething more; many words in the Arabic and Per&s;ian languages which expre&s;s LOVE, imply al&s;o MELANCHOLY, MADNESS, and DEATH.</P></NOTE>.<PB N="203" REF="234"></P>

<P>A Roman Triumph, and the amour of a Grecian Slave for her Prince, are objects not &s;o remote from our dome&s;tic feelings as may at fir&s;t appear. The Proce&s;&s;ion to St. Paul's, to commemorate our ever glorious Naval Victo|ries, was &s;o de&s;titute of the picture&s;que to charm the en|lightened eye of Ta&s;te, and &s;o wanting of tho&s;e objects which can communicate, even to the bo&s;om of the &s;imple&s;t citizen, a patriotic enthu&s;ia&s;m, that I could not help me|ditating on the full, the varied, and the maje&s;tic picture of a Roman Triumph.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of Aciloe and his lover in this Ro|mance, is only that in which more than one noble emi|grant has been placed. I know one who had taught him&s;elf to forget the world in the neat cottage of a farmer; but his &s;en&s;ibility was greater than his fortitude, and, lacerated from all he cheri&s;hed, he became danger|ou&s;ly ill. By the devoted tenderne&s;s of the farmer's daughter, who&s;e natural talents he had refined with exqui&s;ite ta&s;te, he recovered his health. As he recovered, the farmer's daughter became every day more pallid, more dejected, and at length was menaced with a confirmed mara&s;mus. No one &s;u&s;pected the cau&s;e of her vi&s;ible

decay; &s;he never complained. The conver&s;ation of the noble emigrant often turned on the &s;plendid hi&s;tory of the French court, and the &s;tern dignity of his own family, allied to the royal blood. The race is marked (let him pardon the expre&s;&s;ion) with that haughtine&s;s which is the germ of many heroic virtues. He him&s;elf would be proud, did not the tenderne&s;s of his feelings &s;truggle with his hereditary glory. To all he &s;aid, the farmer's daughter li&s;tened with too fond an attention; and while the ma|lady of her heart (for the infection breathed in her heart) inflamed it&s;elf but the more at &s;uch di&s;cour&s;e, &s;he felt that,

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE venerable and &s;ublime Paulus Aemi|lius now returned from the final conque&s;t of the Macedonian empire. Rome, in awful &s;ilence, awaited the decree of the &s;enate for THE TRIUMPH.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;embled &s;poils of nations Aemilius had not profaned. The general had only
<PB N="210" REF="239">
permitted his &s;ons to &s;hare among them|&s;elves the library of Per&s;eus, the king of Macedon; and they preferred manu&s;cripts to va&s;es of gold. They now returned, nei|ther &s;olicitous nor ambitious of the triumph; they returned but to ha&s;ten to their paternal farm, who&s;e &s;moke, wreathing in their natal air, was to them an object more cheri&s;hed than the pomp of a triumph. There, &s;ix|teen of this hero race &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, and the hands of con&s;uls guided the plough. But the glare of &s;plendour, and trea&s;ures hitherto unknown, corrupted the army; and the &s;oldiers, in re|turning to Rome, murmured at the &s;evere ju&s;tice of Aemilius, who had only combated for his country, and with an affectionate pride, yielded all his labours to the maternal city. Conducted and inflamed by Servius Galba, they mutinied. They ranged the city; they &s;urrounded the capitol; they menaced the tribunes; they contemned the &s;enate; they oppo&s;ed the voice of the peo|ple. It &s;eemed to the Romans, that their
<PB N="211" REF="240">
&s;oldiers had returned not to rejoice in their victories, but them&s;elves to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Rome.</P>
<P>The voluble and &s;arca&s;tic Galba calumni|ated the hoary general. It was then Marcus Servilius ro&s;e; Servilius of con&s;ular dignity, who&s;e arm had &s;o often triumphed in &s;ingle combat. He ro&s;e, and with the energetic truth of heroi&s;m, reminded the Roman peo|ple what Paulus Aemilius had performed for them during more than half the life of man. It is not fit (he proceeded) that lily-&s;kinned men, who&s;e unbrui&s;ed &s;hields are worn only on fe&s;tal days, and who&s;e tongues are more dangerous than their &s;words, &s;hould dare to talk of generals and of triumphs before you. Oh, my friends! that we had no orators but tho&s;e who&s;e eloquence were written where their hearts beat! In &s;aying this he flung open his robe, and di&s;played a brea&s;t &s;caled with &s;cars: the martial exploits of Servilius ru&s;hing into their minds, the &s;oldiers bowed, while their &s;hields, in touching each other,
<PB N="212" REF="241">
gave a &s;olemn &s;ound. Marcus had certain &s;wellings in his body; Galba pointed, and derided.&mdash;Thou deride&s;t me (&s;aid the white|haired con&s;ul) for what I hold as honourable for me as the wreath of laurel I claim for Aemilius. For you, fellow-citizens! ince&s;|&s;antly, by day and by night, I travelled and I fought; and the pain I &s;till receive from the&s;e, is to me a &s;en&s;ation of glory. As for Aemilius, I know him well; he will lament this triumph, as an interruption of his return to his farm; for it only delights him, to tread the field of war or the field of peace. But we, Romans, are to be ju&s;t, even to tho&s;e who exact not ju&s;tice; we are to &s;eek the glory, which in vain would conceal it&s;elf. Proceed, Galba! collect thy votes! I will follow thee, to note down the degenerate and the ingrate; and may my la&s;t accent, be that of reproach to the Roman who votes again&s;t the triumph of Aemilius! He cea&s;ed. The army &s;houted, Aemilius is godlike! Servius Galba &s;lunk away, and lo&s;t him&s;elf
<PB N="213" REF="242">
among the crowd, and all the tribes decreed the triumph of Aemilius.</P>
<P>And now the &s;oldiers di&s;per&s;ing, mingled with the people: ancient friends had &s;carcely time to &s;eek each other, and embrace, ere the &s;ound of erecting &s;caffolds, to view the tri|umphal march, echoed through the city. The triumph was decreed to la&s;t three days<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Of Roman triumphs the only detail we have is, I be|lieve, left us by Livy, which Plutarch copied in his life of Paulus Aemilius. In the picture of this triumph I have combined the mo&s;t &s;triking incidents. Monte&s;quieu, with his happy conci&s;ene&s;s, &s;ays: <Q REND="inline">"Romulus and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors were engaged in perpetual wars with their neighbours: they returned to their city with their &s;poils, con&s;i&s;ting of wheat|&s;heaves and flocks; this filled them with the greate&s;t joy. Such is the <HI>origin</HI> of <HI>triumphs!</HI> to which that city afterwards chiefly owed its grandeur."</Q></P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>At length the day arrived, and Rome a&s;|&s;embled ere the &s;un had ri&s;en. The people, clad in white garments, hurrying along in ma&s;&s;es, now rolling, now floating, looked like the tumult of a &s;ea. The windows and the porches of hou&s;es were crowded; &s;ome were &s;eated on domes, &s;ome had climbed on
<PB N="214" REF="243">
columns, and &s;ome were clinging to &s;len|der ballu&s;trades: another Rome &s;eemed hanging in the air! Every thing on which the eye could re&s;t was adorned. Every citi|zen hung out from his windows carpets of purple and gold, and placed on his walls pictures of value. The &s;treets were &s;trewed with flowers; the temples were fancifully embelli&s;hed with boughs; the &s;tatue of every god was crowned with a garland; and all the air was &s;weet with the fuming incen&s;e from the altars. To the eye, almo&s;t deceiv|ed, it &s;eemed as if a magic grove had ri&s;en in one night. An object, not le&s;s intere&s;t|ing than Rome thus ornamented, was the view of all its beauties leaning on the balco|nies &s;cattering odoriferous flowers, and twin|ing wreaths of laurel for the approaching victor.</P>
<P>And now the lictors marched with their axes and their rods, opening a pa&s;&s;age. On the fir&s;t day of the triumph two hundred and fifty cars were filled with the brilliant
<PB N="215" REF="244">
miracles of Grecian art; pictures, which, as they pa&s;&s;ed, &s;eemed like mirrors, to reflect &s;ome exi&s;ting &s;cene of nature; and colo&s;&s;al &s;tatues, who&s;e view gave a new conception of humanity, and, as they pa&s;&s;ed, &s;o finely were the pa&s;&s;ions chi&s;&s;eled, that they in&s;pired <HI>lovers,</HI> who &s;ighed at their beauty, or awed <HI>votari&s;ts</HI> with a religious trembling<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This mu&s;t be under&s;tood literally: both in the pa&s;t and in the pre&s;ent age there have been men who were LOVERS of &s;tatues.

Sooth|ing and delicious were the emotions of the Roman people on that day. On the &s;econd, va&s;t was the cra&s;hing &s;ound of the iron wheels of numerous wains, that contained the arms and the armour of the Macedoni|ans; with artful negligence they had loo&s;ely heaped the martial in&s;truments, and they rang loudly and glittered confu&s;edly again&s;t each other. Helmets and targets, and jave|lins and &s;hields, and cuira&s;&s;es, and the points
<PB N="216" REF="245">
of naked &s;words, formed a &s;hining terror, while the &s;pectators even trembled at the view of the arms of the conquered. When all the&s;e had pa&s;&s;ed, their terrific &s;ound re|mained. But they were &s;oon delighted by innumerable ve&s;&s;els holding the coined &s;ilver, each &s;upported by four men, oppre&s;&s;ed by the ma&s;&s;ive weight. The proce&s;&s;ion clo&s;ed with an exhibition, artfully arranged, of &s;culptured va&s;es, ine&s;timable for their beauty, and even &s;ingular for their value. That day diffu&s;ed not the plea&s;ure of the former; they had viewed nothing but objects of terror and objects of wealth. It was on the third, and la&s;t day, that the human pa&s;&s;ions were awak|ened by objects of humanity.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t they &s;tarted in terror. The trum|pets and the clarions did not &s;ound a flouri&s;h, as on a fe&s;tal day, but blew &s;uch a charge as they were accu&s;tomed when they excited their &s;oldiers to battle. It was in&s;antly ru|moured, and imagined, that the army had again mutinied, and Rome, as if &s;he felt
<PB N="217" REF="246">
her&s;elf in de&s;olation, quaked and quailed to her heart. But &s;oon the mode&s;t and regu|lated &s;teps of the martial mu&s;icians turned con&s;ternation into confidence and a breath|le&s;s tranquillity. It was now the Romans &s;ecurely indulged their eye and their heart.</P>
<P>After the heralds and trumpeters &s;ucceeded young men in flaxen robes, with their arms and bo&s;oms bare, leading more than a hun|dred &s;talled oxen, who&s;e horns were gilded, and who&s;e backs were adorned with bande|lets, interlaced with &s;e&s;toons of flowers. The&s;e victims la&s;hed their long tails joy|ou&s;ly; &s;en&s;ible of the pomp, and perhaps thinking it would lead them to their pa&s;|tures. Then followed beautiful boys, who&s;e chins had yet no down, and their tre&s;&s;es floating luxuriantly on their &s;houlders, each bearing a ve&s;&s;el of the lu&s;tral water. Now marched &s;oldiers, carrying the coined gold and the antique and ma&s;&s;y va&s;es from the royal trea&s;ures. At &s;ome interval the car of Per&s;eus, the conquered monarch, was trained. That
<PB N="218" REF="247">
regal throne was now a &s;olitude, and nothing was viewed in it but, on the &s;eat, his armour and his diadem. Behind walked the family of Per&s;eus, of whom the mo&s;t remarkable was Aciloe, his elde&s;t &s;on. The matrons and the virgins of Rome wept as they gazed on his beauty and the intendering melan|choly that &s;haded his touching phy&s;iognomy. Muffled in a black mantle Per&s;eus appeared; his head was bare, his hands and his feet clanked with chains of iron. He leant his head on his brea&s;t; but tho&s;e who were near him &s;aw with contempt, and &s;ome with pity, his dark eyes &s;uffu&s;ed with a red flame, and hatred, ignominy, and de&s;pair, torturing his horrid phy&s;iognomy. Per&s;eus, the coward and the tyrant, who refu&s;ed the death he was offered.&mdash;Thou art not (&s;aid an old Ro|man as he pa&s;&s;ed), thou art not worthy to be permitted to die<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Compo&s;ing a romance, I was not willing to copy the page of the hi&s;torian; but Livy, the mo&s;t picture&s;que of ro|mancers, de&s;cribes Per&s;eus more &s;trikingly; his words are to this purpo&s;e: <Q REND="inline">"He re&s;embled one &s;truck by thunder; one, in whom the greatne&s;s of his griefs had taken away the very feeling."</Q></P></NOTE>!</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="248">
At length a gayer &s;pectacle charmed. Four hundred crowns of gold, pre&s;ented to Aemilius from as many cities, or as tributes, or as gifts, now glittered in the air! And now a hollow murmur went along the crowd, the triumphal car appeared, and the people &s;houted. It was ornamented with a magnificence that &s;eemed the emblem of the genius of its hero: clothed in purple, wrought with golden flowers, the venerable form of Aemilius &s;at, and extending his right hand, held a laurel branch. There was a &s;adne&s;s in his countenance too penetrating for even the magnanimity of that hero to conceal. That week, the week of his tri|umph, Pe&s;tilence &s;pread her midnight wing over his hou&s;e; and &s;ome had died, and &s;ome were dying; and his dome&s;tic roof was a tomb. So Fortune wars with man! Tears were &s;ometimes &s;een on his cheek. The
<PB N="220" REF="249">
whole army followed with branches of laurel in their hands, &s;ome chaunting the culogy of their general, and &s;ome pointing at him their &s;harpe&s;t railleries. And thus the tri|umph of Aemilius clo&s;ed!</P>
<P>When the proce&s;&s;ion ended, Servius Galba remained &s;urrounded by a few malicious &s;pi|rits, who, till the army pa&s;&s;ed, had hoped the mutiny would again have broken out in the cour&s;e of the triumph. For &s;ome time they gazed on each other in &s;ilence and dejection. Galba then addre&s;&s;ed them:&mdash;What! is the freedom of &s;peech denied a Roman citizen? My friends, this is a &s;cene for us to ridicule; it merits not our anger. And this then is the glory of our tremendous hero? And the great Aemilius is ambitious of becoming the chief actor in a &s;tate panto|mime? By Hercules! for a handful of &s;e&s;|terces I'll hire you a hero dre&s;&s;ed in a lamb|&s;kin and a &s;ooty face; his <HI>mimi</HI> &s;hall beat our general's. O, Jove! thy tunic was pro|faned this day! It is this, my friends,
<PB N="221" REF="250">
which rou&s;es indignation, that the Roman people &s;hould bend their &s;upple knee to whomever the &s;enate decrees honours; im|becil and &s;uper&s;titious like Egyptians, we wor&s;hip calves, when they tell us they are &s;anctified. I hate the &s;enate, by all the gods, I &s;wear! This &s;enate, corruptors and cor|rupted; minions of the patricians! Oh! that we had no &s;enate, or, that every citizen were a &s;enator! That day &s;hould be marked with white; <HI>that</HI> were a day to thank Jupi|ter! And, to be &s;ure, the gods are much concerned with the victories of us Romans, who carry our oppre&s;&s;ion wherever we can lead an army; and who would even take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;eats of the gods them&s;elves had they but given us the wings of our eagles!</P>
<P>In this manner Galba and his adherents exhaled their bile, and, retiring from the happy metropolis, that night at &s;upper their falernian wine ta&s;ted like gall in their mouth; the bitter thought of envy was in their hearts; that bitter thought which communicates even
<PB N="222" REF="251">
to the face of man a yellow hue. But, in the city of Rome, they danced in circles, and carolled in chorus; that night no eye was clo&s;ed in Rome; the &s;treets, blazing with torches, gave a midnight &s;un; while in the &s;hadowy groves, &s;ilvered by a &s;weet moonlight, murmured many an amorous ki&s;s.</P>
<P>Hi&s;torians have not informed us of the fate of Aciloe, the &s;on of Per&s;eus. The nar|rative of love, by an aged female &s;lave, at the di&s;tance of fifty years after the triumph of Aemilius, in tracing the progre&s;s of a pa&s;&s;ion, at once mo&s;t tender and mo&s;t hum|ble, pre&s;erves &s;ome part of his &s;ecret hi&s;tory. It was thus the female &s;lave addre&s;&s;ed her companions:&mdash;</P>
<P>YE VIRGINS, in&s;truct your&s;elves in love as ye li&s;ten to my tale. Not mine the pomp of wealth, or the vainer pomp of birth; war had even deprived me of my native valley. Born in Macedon, I &s;carcely remember the warmth of my natal &s;un. From youth to
<PB N="223" REF="252">
age I have lived a &s;lave at Rome; nor have I wi&s;hed a more indulgent life, for in the arms of a lover, &s;lavery can plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Ye have heard of Aciloe, the Prince of Macedon. He became the &s;lave of Anto|nius, and for three olympiads he was my companion. Greece, that had given him birth, had al&s;o given him her arts and her beauty; tho&s;e arts which &s;ubdued the &s;ouls of her conquerors, and that beauty which, perpetuated by her &s;tatues, will tell remote&s;t ages what men peopled that Ely&s;ian climate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The beauty of the men in Greece, and their gymna&s;tic conte&s;ts, were the cau&s;es of the excellence of their arti&s;ts. The per&s;onal beauty, the naked elegance of Nature, and the amenity of their &s;oil and their climate, developed and nouri&s;hed their imaginations, and gave birth to every fine art. Plato de&s;cribes, with enthu&s;ia&s;m, certain youths who were &s;ent as amba&s;&s;adors to the Per&s;ian court, and exults that no nation could produce &s;uch cele&s;tial forms. Diogenes Laertius in vain, and powerle&s;s language, would paint the enchanting figure of the celebrated Xenophon. This per&s;o|nal beauty formed a di&s;tinction between the elevated and the lower ranks. The latter lo&s;t their fine forms in labour and mi&s;ery.&mdash;De Pauw, vol. i. p. 107.</NOTE>. Yes, Aciloe was accompli&s;hed! Apollo had melodi&s;ed his tongue with per&s;ua&s;ion, and
<PB N="224" REF="253">
the mu&s;ic of his happy lyre was various as it was fine; Venus had breathed over him her <Q REND="inline">"purple light,"</Q> and his complexion was like ro&s;es that, bathed in milk, &s;parkle with the &s;nowy dew; and Minerva had given to his intendering countenance tho&s;e humid and tremulous eyes who&s;e blue &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, to look on, edulcorates the heart.</P>
<P>I viewed the fair-faced youth bending in ta&s;ks of &s;trength with an elegance that far other ta&s;ks required. They doubled his la|bours; cruel Romans! tyrannical freemen! they would annihilate princes! as if <HI>princes</HI> were not <HI>men!</HI> I have &s;een the amiable youth blu&s;h at his feeblene&s;s; I never heard him murmur in &s;ervitude beneath a foreign heaven; his frame, but not his mind, lo&s;t its energy: the liberal &s;oul no chain can rivet, no toil can di&s;may.</P>
<P>But, laborious days and &s;orrowing nights clouded his &s;pirit, and cru&s;hed his too ex|qui&s;ite frame. He &s;at alone, and heavy and long-drawn were his &s;ighs; his cheeks had
<PB N="225" REF="254">
lo&s;t their downy bloom, and they looked as if their winter had &s;ucceeded their &s;pring; the wavering light of his eyes was decaying as the faint flame trembles in the lamp; his flaxen ringlets, gli&s;tening like threads of gold, and throwing a &s;oft &s;hadow over his delicate forehead, now neglected, no more danced in wavy curls, but were tangled in de&s;pair: his &s;oul &s;ickened with melancholy. I gazed, I trembled, as I traced a pale con&s;umption, like the &s;ecret Miner, &s;apping &s;ilently and un&s;een.</P>
<P>Touched by his mi&s;ery I felt the inju&s;tice of Fortune. I de&s;ired to con&s;ole him; but when I remembered that the &s;lave had been my prince, my heart recoiled with awe. A natural air of maje&s;ty breathed in his lea&s;t ge&s;ture; Nature de&s;igned him for a prince; his eye commanded, though his tongue was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Has not Nature created &s;ome men capable of imparting felicity to a whole people?
<PB N="226" REF="255">
Oh! were Aciloe (I thought) on his throne, the &s;un would look cheerful to de&s;olated Mace|donia! Such were my thoughts; perhaps the thoughts of a &s;lave: for are not all equals, when they meet in mi&s;ery? Ah! the mi&s;erable want not <HI>re&s;pect,</HI> they only claim <HI>compa&s;&s;ion!</HI></P>
<P>At length, &s;o much he intere&s;ted me, that I felt nothing but pity. One day the Prince was winowing corn: already the &s;tar of Venus had ri&s;en, and half the day's ta&s;k yet remained: exanimate, he dropt the flail; he &s;at down, and covered his face with his hands. I approached, with eyes fixed on the ground, and tremulous foot&s;teps: I knelt before him:&mdash;Aciloe! behold a Ma|cedonian! Oh, Prince! thou ha&s;t yet one faithful &s;ubject! He rai&s;ed his face, flu&s;hed with a &s;aint crim&s;on, and wiped away the tear on his burning cheek: he &s;miled with a tender grace. Ye gods! that fir&s;t &s;mile which entered my heart, &s;till vibrates on its
<PB N="227" REF="256">
fibres! As if my mutual labour had in&s;pired him, that evening he &s;eemed to have for|gotten Macedon.</P>
<P>Learn, ye maidens! that in the gentle of|fices of pity, &s;o &s;weet are the plea&s;ures, we love to repeat them. Beware, my friends! of that &s;oft-&s;ouled Power! Pity, ye know, is the &s;i&s;ter of Love. Ah! often &s;he betrays us into her brother's power, that volatile boy of heaven, who&s;e &s;miling eyes are malicious, and who&s;e very &s;ports are cruel. Yes, Love &s;tole from Pity the &s;park he touched into a flame.</P>
<P>I dared to love Aciloe! I loved, but I re|&s;olved to peri&s;h, ere I would tell my love.</P>
<P>The earth now &s;eemed for ever to deny me tranquillity, and I &s;ought for it in hea|ven and in hell. I knew an old woman of The&s;&s;aly, &s;he was a great enchantre&s;s; &s;he once gave a philtre for a maid, admini&s;tered by the hand of her lover, who, for ten years, had in vain &s;prinkled libations of wine at her door, and covered the walls of his hou&s;e
<PB N="228" REF="257">
with her cheri&s;hed name. She drank it, and &s;he loved. But her pa&s;&s;ion was di&s;tracted; her &s;en&s;es were injured; it was a love with|out mode&s;ty; and &s;he expired in the arms of her mi&s;erable lover. I preferred the mild rites of incantation. She gave me a waxen image; &s;he told me to call it by the name of him I loved, and to place it near the fire, and as it turned, and melted with the heat, he too would turn and melt who&s;e name it bore. I turned the image; I ble&s;&s;ed it as it di&s;&s;olved, drop by drop; and the next day I &s;ought Aciloe with eager joy; but alas! the heat had not reached him! I told the old The&s;&s;alian, and &s;he &s;aid,&mdash;Unhappy maid! Hell has no remedy for thy love! I had dreams by night: I related them to the augurs, and they told me to &s;upplicate the god of love. What incen&s;e breathed, what turtles bled on his altar! I told the augurs that the god was inexorable. Do&s;t thou not &s;ee, they replied, that when thou &s;acrifice&s;t, nothing but &s;moke and vapours are rolled
<PB N="229" REF="258">
about the altar? Forget thy&s;elf, unhappy maid! Heaven is not thy friend!</P>
<P>Yet I could not de&s;pair; the pains of love are not without plea&s;ure, yet his plea&s;ures are full of pain. Much I de&s;ired, little hoped, and nothing a&s;ked<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Brama a&s;&s;ai, poco &s;pera, e nulla chiede."</L></Q>

<P>Have ye not all wor&s;hipped the APOLLO of Praxiteles? Has not its enchanting illu|&s;ion po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed your &s;en&s;es? Surely the god &s;culptured his own &s;tatue! The flexible &s;oftne&s;s of that marble, where the blood &s;eems moving in the veins; the airy har|mony in the proportions, which, to the de|ceived eye, gives the &s;en&s;e of motion; the cele&s;tial &s;mile on tho&s;e half-opened lips, which makes one incline as if to li&s;ten! Softened form of the green &s;pring of life, thine is, eternal youth, the health of a di|vinity! brilliant, yet tender, as the opening dawn! I have gazed on the &s;culptured god
<PB N="230" REF="259">
till I thought it glided in the air! Is not &s;uch the &s;tatue of Apollo? and &s;uch, ye vir|gins! was the form of Aciloe!</P>
<P>Familiari&s;ed to my &s;ervices, he almo&s;t conver&s;ed with me as an equal; but often a dignity in his air, and a maje&s;ty in his conceptions, &s;eparated from his my humbled &s;pirit. Yet he deigned to accept my atten|tions: I ha&s;tened my own labours to con|clude his unfini&s;hed ta&s;ks; and Aciloe was re&s;tored to health! He recovered his viva|city; mine &s;unk as his recovered. The fine&s;t form in Nature &s;eemed to &s;tart from the remains of its decay: I would have given a trea&s;ure for a bracelet of his hair. As I gazed on the &s;hining whitene&s;s of his neck, while a loo&s;e ringlet that had fallen from the re&s;t, threw its &s;oft &s;hadow, how often I &s;ighed to weave it round my fingers!</P>
<P>I felt my&s;elf peri&s;hing. I &s;lumbered in half-awakened dreams; I &s;tarted in tremors; I was lo&s;t in reverie. I ro&s;e weary in the morning, as if the night had been a night
<PB N="231" REF="260">
of toil. I looked on the &s;un, and it cheered me not; I gazed on Aciloe, and all my &s;en&s;es burned. Oppre&s;&s;ed by my own labours, when I toiled for Aciloe, that labour &s;eemed to re&s;tore me. Aciloe &s;aw my dejection, and &s;uffered me not to toil. Oh, the change! Now the pining &s;hadow of what I was, Aciloe, warm in health and gratitude, la|boured for me! He would inquire the cau&s;e of my concealed dejection: I &s;ound no voice, but I &s;elt the blood paint my cheek.</P>
<P>Sometimes my love was not without hope, and I imagined Aciloe had di&s;covered the &s;ecret of my heart; but I checked the de|lightful thought, when I recollected that <HI>Gratitude</HI> is a &s;hade of <HI>Love.</HI> One day from the villa he &s;ent me, by a &s;lave returning to the city, a garland, accompanied by a bril|liant painting of the flowers, as he had in|terwoven them. I knew not which to ad|mire, the creation of Nature, or the work of Art; when each is perfect, Nature touches, and Art charms. I &s;ighed to think that the
<PB N="232" REF="261">
&s;lowers of Aciloe would die that evening. Looking on the border of the picture, I read this in&s;cription:
<Q><L>"LIVING, we were CHERISHED; DEAD, we &s;till EXIST."</L></Q></P>
<P>Ah! I exclaimed, how the &s;ympathetic Aciloe can interpret, at a di&s;tance, the thoughts of my &s;oul! But a thought more melancholy touched me&mdash;that I &s;hould &s;oon die after them; and the garland dropt from my cold and &s;lackened hand. Reflecting thus mournfully, I found in the garland this &s;croll:
<Q><L>"Fade not like the&s;e flowers, for no PAINTING <HI>can &s;upply thy lo&s;s!</HI> The arti&s;t can trace outlines and can catch tints, but he cannot <HI>paint the thoughts</HI> of thy <HI>mind;</HI> he cannot give <HI>another exi&s;tence</HI> to the <HI>virtues</HI> of thy <HI>&s;oul.</HI>"</L></Q></P>
<P>About this time I became &s;olicitous of my dre&s;s. Would ye agitate the heart of your lover? Be DRESS the unperceived labour of your days. Think of it every morning ere ye ri&s;e; vary it with new forms, warm it with new colours. Tru&s;t me, one day, ye will ob&s;erve how the eye of your lover &s;hall linger about you; how all that day, re&s;tle&s;s
<PB N="233" REF="262">
in ec&s;ta&s;y, he will mention objects which have the &s;ame colour as your dre&s;s. That dre&s;s remember well. When at &s;ome di&s;tant day ye &s;hall be e&s;tranged from each other, then, to kindle the heart of the cheri&s;hed traitor, appear in the &s;ame dre&s;s; be the colours the &s;ame, and your &s;miles the &s;ame. Ye will then &s;ee how ea&s;y it is to wind around an affectionate heart!</P>
<P>As for my&s;elf, I was but a &s;lave, and co&s;tly ornaments were not mine. I could not wear the purple dye of Tyre, nor the light ti&s;&s;ues of the I&s;le of Cos; nor were my tre&s;&s;es e&s;&s;enced with the Oronthean myrrh. But cheaper colours may enchant, and &s;impler graces may &s;educe. Sometimes I was dre&s;&s;ed with the lighte&s;t azure, beautiful as the &s;e|rene&s;t &s;ky; or with the pale&s;t ro&s;e colour, delicate as the younge&s;t of tho&s;e tender flow|ers; or with a cha&s;te white, floating redund|ant on the ground, as if I had thrown over me a woven &s;now.</P>
<P>I &s;ought to delight him by tho&s;e tender
<PB N="234" REF="263">
artifices, which recalled to him the memory of his natal &s;oil. Often he had viewed with rapture, on the winding banks of the Euro|tas, the virgins confining their loo&s;e drapery, and rejecting their veiling peplos, in their cour&s;es, and their games, and their dances: half their impatient bo&s;om peered above their ve&s;t, and their naked knee, and their gracile legs, glided with ea&s;y grace. I a&s;|&s;embled my companions, and taught them the Grecian Dance of Ariadne, or the Laby|rinth. I, holding a garland, was their leader, while the large circle, hand in hand, moved &s;lowly around me; then, more animated, they would coil about me, pre&s;&s;ing each again&s;t the other; I waved my garland, I eluded their gra&s;ping hands, I extricated my&s;elf by artful feints, and, winding through them, I e&s;caped, and triumphed. Then I yielded my place to the next; and thus all had the &s;ame garland, but all had not the &s;ame glory. At another time it was a rural dance. I repre&s;ented Flora, and my hair
<PB N="235" REF="264">
was &s;tarred with ro&s;es. I often bade the dance cea&s;e, to chaunt the tender hymn of &s;pring; and then each maiden would take a ro&s;e from my hair, and when all my ro&s;es were de&s;poiled, my hymn clo&s;ed. But Aci|loe was not delighted by our dances. On the banks of my own Eurotas, he &s;aid, they inflamed my &s;oul; but a Grecian dance in Rome, only provokes my indignation.</P>
<P>And yet there was a little &s;pot we had di&s;covered, which he cheri&s;hed: it circled the Palatine hills. After our toiling day, delicious was each evening hour, as wander|ing there, we &s;aw the flocks obey the call of the &s;hepherd's doric reed. Up the &s;ides of one of tho&s;e hills climbed the pendent vineyards; along an expan&s;ive lake winded green walks, fringed with the arbutus and the myrtle; while, &s;till lower, were the olive grounds, who&s;e gloomy umbrage the &s;etting &s;un warmed with its ro&s;eate hue: above us were groves of pine and &s;ilver firs. Here often Aciloe turned away from haughty and
<PB N="236" REF="265">
imperial Rome, its temples, its amphithea|tres, its xy&s;ti, and its forums. He turned away, and &s;ome natural tears fell as he gazed on the cheri&s;hed &s;pot. The cheri&s;hed &s;pot! it was a Grecian &s;cenery, the very &s;emblance of one where he was born. How grateful in a foreign country! he exclaimed, to find a home &s;cene: Rome has not deprived us of <HI>all</HI> our Greece; at lea&s;t, it yields one &s;pot, which brings me back to the lo&s;t earth, where I was cradled!</P>
<P>With hope almo&s;t extinct in my bo&s;om, I could no more labour, and my ma&s;ter bade me retire to die. Aciloe often &s;tole to my &s;ick couch; he wept be&s;ide me; and the prince tended a &s;lave. How often I thought I viewed the infernal bark on the borders of the Styx; as often would the dulcet voice of Aciloe recal me to exi&s;tence:&mdash;how vital the breath of him we love! If I were ex|tinct, and my lover breathed on my lips, I have often thought it would revive my in|animate corp&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="266">
It was thou, &s;aid Aciloe, when death was terrible, for the iron of &s;lavery then fir&s;t rankled in my indignant &s;oul; it was thou who gently &s;tole&s;t away the thorns of a &s;ick pillow. Thus given, life had its value, though its price was &s;lavery. What is the viewle&s;s canker in thy heart? Thy malady is not that of Nature, but that of Pa&s;&s;ion; for thou ha&s;t ever been happy: thou ha&s;t never known freedom, and &s;lavery for thee has no pains. It was &s;omething &s;udden that marred thy harmonious nerves, and broke the joy of thy &s;mooth check. When I recovered, it was then thou did&s;t lo&s;e thy health. Surely the infection of another's grief is not fatal! By Hercules, I will not accept the exi&s;tence purcha&s;ed by thy death! Live then, live! it is thy prince who bids thee live!</P>
<P>As Aciloe &s;poke, my heart opened, elate with hope; I &s;eemed to li&s;ten to the voice of Love. But the awful words&mdash;It is thy prince, clouded my &s;pirit: and when I turn|ed to Aciloe there was a dignity, even in his
<PB N="238" REF="267">
tenderne&s;s, that &s;eemed for ever to tell me, I was not his equal.</P>
<P>Yet, thus to have intere&s;ted my prince, thus to be tended by his hand, gave me a new exi&s;tence. I was now permitted to wan|der at will.</P>
<P>It was the third of the Ides that the fea&s;t in honour of THE GHOSTS, the <HI>feralia,</HI> was held. Every one ha&s;tened to bring &s;ome little offering to the memory of their friends. Aciloe and I walked together to the ob&s;cure &s;epulchre of his father Per&s;eus, who had then lately died. He &s;tood be&s;ide the grave, He looked towards heaven: he knelt, and ki&s;&s;ed the earth; then, clipping &s;ome of his &s;ilken tre&s;&s;es, he depo&s;ited them on the cold tomb. I could not help touching them.&mdash;Touch them not, I pray thee! (he cried,) they are &s;acred to the dead: the manes of our friends are not &s;olicitous of what we pre&s;ent them, it is &s;ufficient if by us they are remembered: nor avarice, nor vanity are beyond the Styx! I &s;tood near him.&mdash;And how is it (&s;aid he)
<PB N="239" REF="268">
that thou do&s;t not bring thine offering?&mdash;Alas! (I replied,) I never knew a parent; I never had a friend! and when I die, no one will &s;oothe my departed &s;pirit, even with the la&s;t gift we pre&s;ent the dead.&mdash;Thou erre&s;t, (replied Aciloe,) for had I &s;urvived thee, I &s;hould never have forgotten thou wert my deare&s;t friend. How &s;weet were tho&s;e won|drous words! What if he is not my lover (I thought) is he not the &s;emblance? is he not my friend?</P>
<P>But what is friend&s;hip when we a&s;k for love? 'Tis like the fragrance of remote flowers, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">aintly touches the &s;en&s;es; or like the beam of the cha&s;te moon, that gives light, but yields not warmth. Still, &s;till I pined: &s;ometimes, to embolden me to tell my love, I thought that a pa&s;&s;ion for a &s;ervant had not made even heroes blu&s;h; the &s;uperb Achilles was enamoured of his beauteous Bri&s;eis, and the regal Agamemnon pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">erred, to Clytemne&s;|tra, the more tender Chry&s;eis. How often has the pang of ungratified love made my
<PB N="240" REF="269">
brain frantic! Then would I ha&s;ten to Aci|loe, re&s;olved to tell my love, and willing to die: but while my bo&s;om ro&s;e and panted in his ab&s;ence, when I approached him it &s;unk with timidity; it was chilled with awe. I &s;hivered; I wept; I was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>It was now the ambro&s;ial &s;ea&s;on of the FLORALIA, the fe&s;tal day of Flora. All in|vites us then to perfume our&s;elves with e&s;|&s;ences, to twine our temples with branches of myrtle, and to wander, gathering the Year's virgin flowers; the more cheri&s;hed children of her fir&s;t birth. The <HI>Circen&s;ian &s;hows</HI> were now proclaimed. That day &s;ome ha&s;tened to the <HI>Naumachia,</HI> to gaze on naval combats; &s;ome to the <HI>Pentathlum,</HI> to view the Athletae, or wre&s;tlers; &s;ome to the <HI>cha|riot races;</HI> and &s;ome to the <HI>Pyrrhic dances.</HI> Rome was happy; our hou&s;e was a &s;olitude; the very &s;treets were &s;ilent. Aciloe and my|&s;elf remained together.</P>
<P>That day I had &s;tudiou&s;ly adorned my&s;elf; my drapery flowed loo&s;e, my arms and my
<PB N="241" REF="270">
knees did not conceal them&s;elves, and my tre&s;&s;es were arranged with a nicer art than became a &s;lave. It was perhaps in honour of the godde&s;s; and yet I thought of Aciloe as I corrected my dre&s;s before my mirror. We &s;at beneath an almond-tree, who&s;e &s;ilvery flowers dropped their odour: we were &s;upping, and Aciloe took off his &s;an|dals to recline on his couch.</P>
<P>This evening (&s;aid he) the world will at lea&s;t forget us, and let us forget the world! Thou ha&s;t done well to braid along thy &s;treaming tre&s;&s;es tho&s;e &s;weet violets and that tender lilac.&mdash;I &s;ighed, for I thought to my|&s;elf that I was but a victim crowned with flowers. My bo&s;om palpitated &s;o warmly, that I turned a&s;ide in di&s;order; but perhaps my eyes expre&s;&s;ed what my tongue refu&s;ed. I &s;tole a &s;ide glance at Aciloe, and I joyed to behold an eye &s;parkling with the tendere&s;t fire.</P>
<P>He addre&s;&s;ed me by name.&mdash;Leucothoe, wilt thou never confide the &s;ecret of thy
<PB N="242" REF="271">
mode&s;t &s;oul? Thou knowe&s;t the gods have not given to Aciloe the marble heart of a ty|rant, but the waxen heart of a &s;lave. Leu|cothoe, thou take&s;t no food! thou &s;peake&s;t not! Nay, turn not away that &s;weet confu|&s;ion on thy cheek. Is my attachment, then, nothing? My&s;terious girl! live, if thou would&s;t have Aciloe live; and &s;mile if thou would&s;t have him happy!</P>
<P>In leaning acro&s;s the table his lips almo&s;t touched my face; his tones &s;o tender and &s;o tremulous, deliciou&s;ly whi&s;pered in my ear, and his warm breath pa&s;t over my cheek. I trembled with unknown &s;en&s;ations: my re&s;piration was &s;u&s;pended; a faintne&s;s crept over my limbs; a dimne&s;s fuffu&s;ed my eyes; a low, tremulous noi&s;e wandered in my ears. I felt that I mu&s;t die or mu&s;t &s;peak.</P>
<P>I complained of the odours of the almond tree, but I could not fini&s;h the feigned mur|mur; I &s;ought to ri&s;e, but my limbs were without motion.</P>
<P>I turned to Aciloe. My voice died on my
<PB N="243" REF="272">
quivering lips; a gu&s;h of delicious tears re|&s;tored me.&mdash;Aciloe! and would&s;t thou know my &s;ecret mi&s;ery? 'Tis LOVE con&s;umes me! ambitious Love, that lives on hopele&s;s, and cannot die!</P>
<P>When I fini&s;hed the&s;e hurried words, I hid my face in my bo&s;om. Aciloe heard, Aciloe under&s;tood: his lips breathed on my lips, and my trembling bo&s;om ro&s;e to meet his bo&s;om. Cele&s;tial felicity! O, Love! thou art even the happine&s;s of the gods! Aciloe loved, and never from that hour Aciloe for&s;ook me. Yes, my prince was the &s;lave of his &s;lave! Delicious memory of LOVE! it charms even my old age, and gives to my hoary and &s;nowy head what is dearer than the ro&s;es of &s;pring&mdash;THE REMEMBRANCE OF GOLDEN HOURS!</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>TO illu&s;trate the nature of human inventions, the fol|lowing little Romance has been compo&s;ed. The word <HI>invention,</HI> originating in the Latin <HI>inventus,</HI> explains it&s;elf&mdash;<HI>a finding out.</HI> Invention is neither in&s;piration nor creation, as &s;ome, I believe, &s;till imagine it to be. It is nothing but a <HI>&s;udden ob&s;ervation,</HI> or a <HI>patient medi|tation;</HI> and there can exi&s;t but <HI>two kinds</HI> of invention; the one <HI>accidental,</HI> &s;truck out from a rapid ob&s;ervation, and the other ari&s;ing from <HI>combination,</HI> the fruit of long and ingenious meditation. Man creates nothing; he can only imitate, or combine, what he <HI>finds out</HI> in Nature; he can imagine no form, he can produce no notion, of which the model is not in Nature.</P>
<P>From <HI>accidental inventions</HI> man has derived great utility, but never has claimed any glory; but the invention of tho&s;e arts, or tho&s;e di&s;coveries, in which he has wre&s;t|led with Nature, has agreeably flattered his pride. It will amu&s;e an ingenious mind, to cla&s;s under the&s;e two forms &s;ome traditional origins.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t, and inferior kind of inventions, may be ranked the following:&mdash;A Tartarian hunter, wanting &s;ome wadding, ob&s;erves a &s;tone covered with &s;ome flakes
<PB REF="275" MS="y">
re&s;embling loo&s;e threads; but when he fires his piece, he ob&s;erves that the gunpowder had no effect on the wad|ding. He returns to his village, con&s;ults his curate, and, half-terrified, conceives he has about him &s;ome bewitched &s;tuff. They throw it into a large fire; it does not burn, and they take it out entire. Such was the accidental ori|gin of the <HI>a&s;be&s;tos,</HI> called the incombu&s;tible linen. Of the &s;ame cla&s;s is that of <HI>gla&s;s:</HI> &s;ome merchants in the &s;andy de&s;erts re&s;t their cauldrons on blocks of nitre, and kindle a fire; the nitre di&s;&s;olving in the flame, and mix|ing with the &s;and, produces a tran&s;parent friable &s;ub&s;tance, which is <HI>gla&s;s.</HI> In the city of Tyre, a dog &s;eizing on the fi&s;h Conchilis, or <HI>Purpura,</HI> his lips were ob&s;erved to be tinged with that glowing <Q REND="inline">"ro&s;y red,"</Q> and it received its name from the town and the fi&s;h, for it was called, <HI>The Tyrian purple.</HI> Children playing in the &s;hop of a &s;pec|tacle-maker, with convex and concave gla&s;&s;es, arrange them in &s;uch a manner that the church &s;teeple appeared to have removed it&s;elf near to them. Their loud acclama|tions excite the curio&s;ity of their father. The man of &s;ci|ence looks through the gla&s;&s;es the hands of children had arranged, and he di&s;covers&mdash;the <HI>tele&s;cope!</HI> Accident alike di&s;covered gunpowder, printing, and the quinquina; the latter, perhaps, more &s;alutary than either of the for|mer. Such has been the origin of many u&s;eful inventions, but in which the inventor could lay no claim to ingenuity.</P>
<P><PB REF="276">
The &s;econd cla&s;s ennobles man; his dilated &s;oul tra|ver&s;es through earth and heaven, and he almo&s;t a&s;pires to the energy of a &s;ublime Creator. The ancients have record|ed, that the exqui&s;ite combinations of <HI>mu&s;ic</HI> derived their origin from a philo&s;opher who &s;tood li&s;tening to the &s;trokes of a hammer on an anvil. It was by meditating on the knolls of old oak trees, and the pavements of London, that that &s;ublime edifice, the <HI>Edy&s;tone,</HI> was rai&s;ed in the tumul|tuous brea&s;t of the &s;ea by its great arti&s;t. The fact is re|corded, with great &s;implicity, by him&s;elf; and the&s;e knolls, and the&s;e pavements, from whence he fir&s;t &s;tole the hints, are engraven in his &s;ingular work. One evening in the cathedral of Pi&s;a, Galileo ob&s;erved the vibrations of a bra&s;s lu&s;tre, pendent from the vaulted roof, that had been left &s;winging by one of the vergers. The pen&s;ive eye of Genius meditated, and its &s;oul &s;truggled with va&s;t ideas. Hence he conceived the notion of mea&s;uring time by the medium of a <HI>pendulum,</HI> and thus <HI>invented</HI> the clements of motion and mechanics. The origin of <HI>gravitation</HI> is perhaps more &s;ublime, &s;ince the accident was more trivial. The charming art of engraving owes one of its branches to the meditation of a &s;tudious prince. Rupert perceiving a &s;oldier &s;craping and clean&s;ing his fu&s;il, on which the night|dews had fallen and had ru&s;ted, he combined its effects, and from the&s;e conceived <HI>mezzotinto.</HI> I will add two others,
<PB REF="277">
which are extremely intere&s;ting. Jonas Moore, employed to &s;urvey the fens, noticed that the <HI>&s;ea</HI> made a <HI>curve line</HI> on the beach; and from this circum&s;tance be borrowed the hint, to keep it effectually out of <HI>Norfolk.</HI> A French bead-maker ob&s;erving, that the water which had wa&s;hed tho&s;e &s;mall fi&s;h called Bleaks, was filled with luminous particles of a &s;ilvery bue, and depo&s;ited a &s;ediment po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing the lu&s;tre of the mo&s;t beautiful pearls, formed from it the <HI>pearl e&s;&s;ence,</HI> which, with melted i&s;ingla&s;s, is blown into thin gla&s;s globules, and produces <HI>artificial pearls.</HI></P>
<P>Reflecting on the origin of human inventions, I com|bined many recorded traditions, all of which wear a na|tural air of truth. I imagined a little tale, in which, placing two primitive human beings in Arcadia, the mutual de&s;ire, and the nece&s;&s;ity of reciprocal plea&s;ure, would na|turally give birth to the agreeable arts. Some difficulties aro&s;e in this little &s;ketch, but the completion of my de&s;ign was of more con&s;equence than an attempt to overcome one or two improbabilities. The judicious reader will ea&s;ily detect and forget them. The indulgence of a reader is one requi&s;ite in this &s;pecies of fictions.</P>

<HEAD>PART THE FIRST.</HEAD>
<P>IN a valley of Arcadia Amaryllis was a &s;hepherde&s;s; on the rocks above, Lycidas was a goatherd. Their &s;ituation approached that of primaeval &s;olitude; never had they ob&s;erved other human forms than their old fathers and mothers, whom they vi&s;ited at the full moon, when their flocks were guarded by the &s;ilence of &s;leep.</P>
<P>In the luxuriant valley Amaryllis conducted her &s;heep, while Lycidas pur&s;ued his capri|cious
<PB N="252" REF="279">
goats on the rocky clifts. Amaryllis found her companions like her&s;elf, timid and docile; they rather followed her, than &s;he them. Often had &s;he mea&s;ured her height with the old ewes, and di&s;covered how &s;he increa&s;ed in &s;tature.</P>
<P>Lycidas was vigorous as the goats he chaced; he flew fearle&s;sly along the points of clifts, and &s;tood on one foot, at the edge of a precipice, to &s;natch the wild goat hang|ing at the perilous extremity. Amaryllis fre|quently ob&s;erved him above her with a tre|mulous delight; and imitating his voice, found that her tones could not, like his, fill the hollow hills. Ah! there, &s;he thought, is one like my&s;elf, who&s;e &s;trong feet outleap a goat! Lycidas looked down &s;ometimes on Amaryllis, and thought, there is one like my&s;elf, who&s;e &s;oft look is more tender than the eye of a lamb!</P>
<P>One day the &s;hepherde&s;s, at the brink of a river, was bathing a lamb; while Lycidas, leaning from a rock above, watched the tran&s;|parent
<PB N="253" REF="280">
water-drops trickling on its &s;nowy coat, and hanging her fingers with pearls. The lamb fell into the river; Amaryllis &s;hrieked. Behold Lycidas in the &s;tream! He brings the breathle&s;s animal; he dries its velvet &s;kin; he warms it in his brea&s;t; its little &s;ides palpitate once more.&mdash;It is <HI>born again!</HI> (he exclaims) pre&s;enting it to Ama|ryllis.&mdash;Ah! (&s;aid the pa&s;toral virgin, look|ing her gratitude) I thought, till now, that a goatherd cared not for the &s;orrows of a &s;hepherde&s;s.&mdash;Oh, Amaryllis! (replied Ly|cidas) I often think of thee.&mdash;How &s;ingular is this, oh Lycidas! I, too, often think of thee&mdash;When I view thee ki&s;&s;ing a lamb, I would give ten of my goats to be that lamb.&mdash;Lycidas, thou &s;halt have my ki&s;&s;es when thou wilt; come from the mountains when thou would&s;t have me ki&s;s thee!</P>
<P>After this interview Lycidas was continu|ally de&s;cending from the rocks to receive the care&s;&s;es of Amaryllis. But &s;weet ki&s;&s;es in|&s;pired &s;weet words: it became nece&s;&s;ary to
<PB N="254" REF="281">
unite the goats of Lycidas with the &s;heep of Amaryllis; and the mountaineers gradu|ally abated their wildne&s;s among the mild inmates of the valley: yet, though influ|enced by the local &s;oftne&s;s, and lo&s;ing their re&s;tle&s;s de&s;ire of climbing by continually treading on a level earth, they &s;till retained their untamed &s;pirit; and, never mingling with the timorous, ever preceded and con|ducted the feebler dome&s;tics.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve (&s;aid Amaryllis to Lycidas) how thy goats di&s;dain the &s;ociety of my &s;heep! How is it, oh Lycidas! that thou admitte&s;t me to thy arms, as if I were thy equal?</P>
<P>I have heard my father &s;ay (replied the youth), that man is an animal more noble than a goat; that his face looks up towards the gods. And yet this &s;eems an error; for my face only looks &s;traight forwards; were I to look up to the gods, I &s;hould &s;tumble.</P>
<P>Could&s;t thou ever under&s;tand (enquired Amaryllis) what the goats think of man?</P>
<P>Oh, yes! a&s;&s;uredly they deem them&s;elves
<PB N="255" REF="282">
&s;uperior. They climb, with their hollow foot, on ridges narrow as thy &s;lender finger. I have viewed them &s;leep on the point of a precipice, where my <HI>eye</HI> only could <HI>touch</HI> them: I have waked them by my voice; but they only rai&s;ed their heads and &s;hook their beards, and again laid them&s;elves to &s;leep. I have watched at the foot of the rock, in patient helple&s;&s;ne&s;s. Such is MAN!</P>
<P>I have often thought (replied Amaryllis) that man is a kind of goat; for our fathers have beards, but the faces of our mothers are &s;mooth as mine and my &s;heep. Thou too wilt have a beard, no doubt, (&s;he pa&s;&s;ed her hand playfully over his chin) already I perceive a fine brown &s;hade gli&s;ten around thy face. How &s;oft! I touch it, but cannot feel it. Be &s;ure all human beings are only a kind of goats and &s;heep. Thine eye &s;eems to command Nature, thy &s;trong &s;tep echoes on the earth; but I timidly follow thee, and all my glory is my &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In conver&s;ations thus &s;imple and innocent,
<PB N="256" REF="283">
they &s;ometimes interchanged their thoughts; but they &s;ported more than they talked. At the margent of a lucid fountain, or under an umbrage, dropping ro&s;es, they divided their milk and their fruits; the velvet turf &s;prang under their flying feet; the echo multiplied their &s;ilver voices. Mimicking a butting goat, Lycidas would run at Amaryllis; but Amaryllis mo&s;t loved to lie down like a &s;heep, and, in &s;hort pantings, breathe on her be|loved Lycidas. Amaryllis would conceal her&s;elf behind a woodbine hedge, or lie in the covering fern; and then Lycidas would call on her, &s;eek her through all her hiding &s;pots, and murmur at, yet half-enjoy, the feigned ab&s;ence. Seldom could he track her through her inventive and my&s;terious paths, till the playful maid betrayed her&s;elf by a loud laugh; or attempted to fly, while her inviting eyes accu&s;ed the pur&s;uer's tardy em|brace. Sometimes when he returned home &s;he would lie down, feigning to &s;leep, while her eyes were half open, to &s;ee if Lycidas
<PB N="257" REF="284">
would immediately ha&s;ten to her; the youth kneeled, and &s;ighed, and ki&s;&s;ed her eyes, till &s;he laughed.</P>
<P>Sometimes he would di&s;order her wavy tre&s;|&s;es, while &s;he murmured with a &s;mile; and then would adorn them to his fancy, &s;tud|ding them with ro&s;es, or braiding them with je&s;&s;amine. But if he often loved to di&s;order her fine tre&s;&s;es, he was careful, in pa&s;&s;ing her favourite flowers, to &s;upport their bended &s;talks, and to weave more clo&s;ely her fa|vourite &s;hades. The tender remini&s;cence of her lover's attention often mingled with the delicious perfumes of the flower, and the bowery verdure of the tree. He would com|po&s;e what he called <HI>&s;erpents of flowers,</HI> and fancifully wind them about her long tre&s;&s;es, praying the gods that no other &s;er|pents might ever approach her.</P>
<P>One evening, beneath a lofty myrtle-tree, the beauteous Amaryllis was lamenting the death of a nightingale. She &s;aid, Sweete&s;t tears have fallen with the touching clo&s;e of
<PB N="258" REF="285">
its delicious tones: I felt the mu&s;ic creep along my nerves, and the fine vibrations play through my heart. I weep now, Lycidas, when I think &s;uch a charming &s;adne&s;s may never again give delightful tears.</P>
<P>Ah! that I could recal thy nightingale into exi&s;tence, as I did thy drowned lamb! exclaimed the amiable youth.</P>
<P>Thou never can&s;t, dear companion! it breathed a long and dying fall, like the gen|tle airs, moving the tops of the hollow reeds, making a moaning melody.</P>
<P>Studious to charm his beloved with the voice of the nightingale, the thoughts of Lycidas produced a &s;leeple&s;s night: the next day he gave Amaryllis the care of his goats, and promi&s;ed an early return. The &s;un de|clined, and Lycidas returned not. Amaryllis &s;ighed at its farewell beam. She &s;at, her head reclining on her arm. Suddenly aerial notes floated in &s;oft remote &s;ounds. The &s;tartled Amaryllis exclaimed&mdash;The air &s;ings in the clouds! The notes &s;eemed approach|ing
<PB N="259" REF="286">

(Lycidas replied but by the accents of his harmonious mouth.) What miracle is this! Can&s;t thou give a vocal &s;oul to a hollow reed?&mdash;Yes, (replied Lycidas,) it was thou who did&s;t in&s;truct me: Thou did&s;t re&s;emble the voice of the night|ingale to the light AIRS breathing on the hollow REEDS. All day I wandered for a nightingale, and I found none: I took a reed, and made little entrances for my breath: I &s;aid, Oh, gentle reed! I can give thee AIR, if thou can&s;t yield me the VOICE of the nightingale: I BREATHED, and it was MUSIC!</P>
<P>This fir&s;t of flutes was their mo&s;t valued acqui&s;ition, for it be&s;towed a new plea&s;ure; and in the &s;olitude of lovers, plea&s;ure is their only avarice. Lycidas, gradually modulating his reed by his ear, perceived the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive

<P>She held in her lap a trea&s;ury of flowers, which &s;he was a&s;&s;orting to weave into a wreath for Lycidas.

and I catch &s;ome half-dream. It is in winter I feel unhappy: the cave our fathers hewed is &s;o round, or &s;o &s;quare, one &s;ees the termi|nation of every thing; nothing is left to the imagination. It is not thus in Nature; &s;he never <HI>impri&s;ons</HI> the eye; all her lines are waved, and varied, and enchanted.

<P>Lycidas replied:&mdash;Had I been idle la&s;t winter, as thou wert, I too &s;hould have been melancholy in the cave. Then I made reeds for &s;ummer &s;ongs, I added another aperture to my flutes, and I produced a new mu&s;ic. How many ha&s;t thou broken in thy fir&s;t le&s;|&s;ons? Do not mind them, Amaryllis; I am plea&s;ed when thou breake&s;t them; for to me it is delightful to amend thy reeds, and to pa&s;s my fingers over the places thine have touched.</P>
<P>She ki&s;&s;ed Lycidas, and &s;aid:&mdash;Oh, that our days may be blended, as the AIR we

<P>And I wi&s;h (continued Amaryllis) that we could live in &s;uch a grove through the happy circle of the year.</P>
<P>Thou do&s;t nothing but <HI>wi&s;h,</HI> &s;aid Lycidas.</P>
<P>Had I &s;uch a grove in winter, the a&s;pect of Nature would con&s;ole me in thy ab&s;ence. Ob&s;erve how finely arched is the grove above us by the interwoven boughs; as if placed in a regular order, view the &s;traight trunks of the palm-trees; mark the little openings around, delighting the eye with various views; and here, as we &s;it, this &s;eems the only entrance of the grove. On the hollow curves of the&s;e trees my foot has re&s;ted, when I climbed, till I was &s;eated at their &s;ummit. One day I a&s;cended, and de|&s;cried
<PB N="268" REF="295">
thee on the great rock, directing thy goats. I &s;aw thee urging the vagrants home, and often ki&s;&s;ing thy hand as thou did&s;t &s;tretch it towards our valley; approaching, thou did&s;t &s;ound thy reed; then my heart bounded with the tender thought, that thou did&s;t <HI>remember me</HI> when thou thoughte&s;t that I could <HI>not &s;ee thee!</HI></P>
<P>While the voluble beauty was de&s;cribing the grove, the eye of Lycidas had inten&s;ely followed the objects of her fancy. And now he was lo&s;t in reverie. The bunch of grapes he held in his hand remained unplucked; when &s;he cea&s;ed, he &s;poke not; he wandered from thought to thought; he &s;at in motion|le&s;s ab&s;traction.</P>
<P>Art thou di&s;ordered, my &s;weet Lycidas? Not one &s;mile dimples thy cheek; the hea|vine&s;s of &s;leep pre&s;&s;es thy lids. Ah! thou looke&s;t on the earth, and not on Amaryllis!</P>
<P>Lycidas, &s;tarting from his trance, flung the grapes from his hand in rapture. The crea|tive &s;mile of Enthu&s;ia&s;m lighted up every
<PB N="269" REF="296">
feature; his eye &s;wam in a liquid fire; a tremor of &s;en&s;ibility vibrated through his frame. Looking on Amaryllis with com|placency, he &s;aid&mdash;I was only <HI>thinking.</HI></P>
<P>And why do&s;t thou <HI>think,</HI> dear Lycidas? to think is to toil. With thee I never <HI>think,</HI> I only <HI>feel;</HI> it is in thine ab&s;ence I <HI>think</HI> and <HI>&s;uffer.</HI> In the enjoyment of thy pre&s;ence, when I lay my hand on thy beating heart; when I &s;eal my trembling lips on thy &s;oft lips; when I blend my breath with thy breath, it is then I am all <HI>&s;en&s;ation.</HI> Ah! then &s;hould a &s;ingle <HI>thought</HI> intervene, I &s;hould feel <HI>it</HI> an interruption of my exi&s;t|ence.</P>
<P>Lycidas replied, &s;miling,&mdash;Do&s;t thou not perceive that thou thy&s;elf art thinking, while thou prattle&s;t again&s;t the labour of thought?</P>
<P>To think with thee, Lycidas, &s;eems no pain; my thoughts embrace thy thoughts, as my arms wind around thy arms. In thine <HI>ab&s;ence</HI> only <HI>thinking</HI> tortures; for &s;ince I have known thee, I abhor all that is <HI>&s;olitary.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="297">
After this conver&s;ation Lycidas was con|&s;tantly ab&s;ent from Amaryllis. He had ever &s;ome prompt excu&s;e. A goat was mi&s;&s;ing; &s;he counted the herd, and the number was ju&s;t. He fell down the rock, and was lamed; &s;he examined his foot, and it was unmarked by a brui&s;e. He was in pur&s;uit of a night|ingale, but he never brought one home. He had li&s;tened hours near a bed of reeds, that his ear might di&s;cover a new mu&s;ic; but he &s;till could only play on one kind of reed. The autumn was clo&s;ing, and his excu&s;es of ab|&s;ence became every day more un&s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>Amaryllis &s;at de&s;erted, and her whole &s;oul dreamed of Lycidas. Her melancholy dif|fu&s;ed it&s;elf over every &s;urrounding object. How Nature has &s;uddenly changed! ex|claimed the &s;olitary virgin. She murmured with the murmurs of the rivulet; &s;he &s;ighed with the evening zephyr; &s;he flew to the portrait, and on the face of the &s;hadowy Lycidas, rolled living tears.</P>
<P>The evening return of Lycidas came un|marked
<PB N="271" REF="298">
by fondne&s;s; pen&s;ive, weary, and &s;ilent; a cold care&s;s, a rapid meal, and a deep &s;lumber. It was now that fir&s;t &s;he per|ceived how, in the pre&s;ence of un&s;ocial man, one may find a terrible &s;olitude.</P>
<P>Sometimes &s;he thought of tracking his concealed retreat; yet it was long ere &s;he could per&s;uade her&s;elf to abandon, for one day, the flock and the herd. Once &s;he fol|lowed him; in agony &s;he pre&s;&s;ed his rapid foot&s;teps on the morning dews; &s;he came to a high rock from whence Lycidas preci|pitated him&s;elf with ea&s;e to another, and di&s;|appeared! She returned to the valley to think and to mourn.</P>
<P>At length the habitual reverie of melan|choly thought and de&s;ponding curio&s;ity pre|&s;ented a mon&s;trous imagination to her di&s;|ordered &s;en&s;es; the terrific chimaera that breeds in the delirium of love. She &s;truck her lovely forehead; the pul&s;es of her tem|ples ro&s;e, burning, to her touch; her &s;oul
<PB N="272" REF="299">
&s;ickened, her frame &s;hivered. She felt the pang of JEALOUSY!</P>
<P>She thinks Lycidas may have di&s;covered <HI>another</HI> Amaryllis: he flies to ki&s;s other cheeks! There are, doubtle&s;s, beings like our&s;elves on this earth: other vallies, other rocks, and other &s;hepherde&s;&s;es! Ah! if every valley &s;hould have its Amaryllis, then is Lycidas for ever lo&s;t to me; for all will adore Lycidas, though Lycidas may adore none. Ah, ingrate! capricious as thy goats! were there as many Lycida&s;es, thou would&s;t be to me the only Lycidas; for I feel I have but one heart, and one heart can love but once.</P>
<P>Every evening Lycidas found his Ama|ryllis in tears. He &s;aid, Why do&s;t thou weep?</P>
<P>Lycidas, can&s;t thou a&s;k why I weep? When thou &s;hake&s;t the flower, do&s;t thou inquire why the trembling dews are &s;cat|tered?</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="300">
Lovelier than the flowers at thy &s;eat in the grove, has thy Lycidas ever rudely touched thy &s;oftne&s;s?</P>
<P>Lycidas, tho&s;e flowers thy hands reared, are faded. Once, in gazing on them, me|thought they had a voice; I heard, or &s;eemed to hear, thou wert then ki&s;&s;ing another Ama|ryllis. I turned, in horror, from tho&s;e flow|ers. How one can cheri&s;h and abhor the &s;ame object!</P>
<P>Another Amaryllis! (exclaimed Lycidas) Is there another on this earth? I have &s;een the &s;ame plants, and the &s;ame animals, reproduce them&s;elves; but never have I &s;een an infant Amaryllis. I con&s;ider thee as A SOLITARY BEAUTY in Nature; there is but one &s;un, one moon, and one Amaryllis!</P>
<P>Enamouring embraces gave to the virgin's &s;oul a new &s;en&s;ation of felicity; <HI>that</HI> which, in one day, re&s;tores the lo&s;t happine&s;s of years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>&mdash;ch'un &s;ol giorno</L>

<P>When Lycidas awoke the &s;ucceeding morn|ing, he quitted not Amaryllis as of late. An unanxious &s;leep re&s;tored the &s;erenity of plea|&s;ure; his &s;oul moved in the calm of the pa&s;|&s;ions; his eye and his hand alike care&s;&s;ed; and his voice had the melody of rapture, for he anticipated a new enjoyment.</P>
<P>He &s;poke.&mdash;Feele&s;t thou not the hoary morning with its fro&s;ty breath? &s;oon will it come with a naked head &s;pread with un|genial &s;now: the old year creeps on with the imperfect day. Is not the old year like our old fathers? Thou mu&s;t quit thy grove.</P>
<P>Alas! if thou for&s;ake&s;t me this winter, the cave will be my &s;epulchre. Thou mu&s;t bury me in it, as we buried the father of my father.</P>

After this trifle was compo&s;ed, a friend pointed out to me a fine poem of Ge&s;ner's, that of <HI>the fir&s;t navigator.</HI> That delicate writer there repre&s;ents a lover meditating on the banks of a river, de&s;irous of cro&s;&s;ing it to obtain a &s;ight of his mi&s;tre&s;s.

<P>Like thee I thought, Amaryllis, when I fir&s;t quitted the &s;hore: like thee, a&s;toni&s;hed, I beheld the mountains tremble, and the val|lies glide! My heart coiled within me. Im|patiently I gained the &s;hore; I gra&s;ped it in eager joy; I ki&s;&s;ed it, I wept over it: Che|ri&s;hed earth! (I cried) on which my Ama|ryllis treads, never &s;hall my feet again wan|der. But &s;oon I found it had never moved.</P>
<P>Amaryllis now, watching the motion of the oars, was again rapt in wonder. The light water-drops, falling from the rai&s;ed oars, excited her fir&s;t attention. She de&s;ired to examine them.&mdash;I thought (&s;he &s;aid) thy <HI>fins</HI> had <HI>white feathers;</HI> they glittered like

the loo&s;e plumage of the dove, &s;cattered by the winds.&mdash;How thou fancie&s;t all thou viewe&s;t! they are but the &s;hining drops of water falling in the &s;unbeam, and glittering as they fall<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among &s;kilful rowers, the art of flinging the water from their oars in long and light trails is termed, <HI>feathering the oar;</HI> from the appearance it bears with falling feathers.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>And now &s;he wondered at the oars in the water. Leaning on one &s;ide, the little bark over&s;et, and the two fir&s;t navigators fell into the &s;tream. Lycidas with one arm embraces the fainting Amaryllis, and with the other &s;teers along the waves; he &s;u&s;tains her droop|ing head; and toiling in the river, exhau&s;t|ed, gains the oppo&s;ite bank. The touch of the &s;olid earth re&s;tores him; he &s;tretches the recovering beauty on the velvet turf; he awakens life by the warmth of his ki&s;&s;es; and when her relumed eyes open, the fir&s;t object they re&s;ted on were the eyes of Ly|cidas. His tender embraces quell her fugi|tive terrors. The boat floated &s;lowly to|wards them.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="309">

<P>Lycidas, well might I gaze; I viewed <HI>an|other wonder</HI> in the &s;tream. The two <HI>fins</HI> which thou did&s;t lift in the air were &s;traight, but moving in the water, they were bent and doubled.</P>

of the &s;udden plunge into the &s;tream. He wrung the water from her fine tre&s;&s;es, he ki&s;&s;ed the drops hanging on her lids, and &s;hook the wet from their dre&s;s. The &s;un darted along an azure heaven; they gave no thought to the pa&s;t, but proceeded, pur|&s;uing each other in &s;port.</P>
<P>They reached a deep and luxuriant val|ley; embo&s;omed among the circling hills, it &s;eemed, even in Arcadia, as if Nature had &s;ought to conceal the &s;pot &s;he fondly em|belli&s;hed. In the centre, another miracle arre&s;ted the rapid &s;teps of Amaryllis; &s;he felt the &s;ame &s;en&s;ation the poli&s;hed European even now feels at the view of a pyramid.

Returned to their valley, they found they had been mi&s;&s;ed. The bleating &s;heep, from all parts, uttered their &s;mall voices of com|plaint. It was the fir&s;t day their tender pa&s;|tore&s;s had de&s;erted. To want her affection, was to them to &s;uffer a revolution in nature.

<P>That night, and the &s;ucceeding day, Ly|cidas con&s;umed in the chace of his rebels; and Amaryllis, in a thou&s;and tender offices, to her &s;oft-hearted family. This was the fir&s;t trouble their happy occupations had known, and they reflected.</P>

They were now de&s;irous of re&s;iding in THE HOUSE. Amaryllis, in quitting the cavern, lamented that &s;he left behind her favourite objects, the portrait of Lycidas, and &s;ome beautiful plants which grew at the entrance of the grove.&mdash;Care not for my &s;hadow (cried Lycidas to the &s;orrowing maid), thou can&s;t trace another on the wall of the hou&s;e; thou knowe&s;t my &s;hadow always accompa|nies me.&mdash;True! but here thou &s;mile&s;t &s;o enchantingly; every feature &s;o felicitou&s;ly plays in thy intendering phy&s;iognomy.

<P>Lycidas had united to the modulation of in&s;trumental, the charm of vocal mu&s;ic.

He perceived that Ama|ryllis felt an ec&s;ta&s;y of plea&s;ure, when in the &s;nowy &s;ea&s;on, reclined by the &s;ocial blaze, he brought to her recollection the &s;cenery of &s;ummer.

<P>This appeared when Amaryllis one day, li&s;tening to the ECHO, inquired of Lycidas,&mdash;What is this my&s;terious flight that my voice takes?

<P>It was in the luxuriance of &s;ummer that Amaryllis perceived her abode had &s;till &s;ome wants. This &s;pot, &s;elected by Lycidas for its amenity and the fore&s;t trees, was not &s;tored with rural luxuries. Lycidas pa&s;&s;ed many hours in returning to their ancient cavern for its neighbouring fruits. Every day he toiled
<PB N="301" REF="328">
beneath a panier filled with the Arcadian food; but whenever he neglected to bring a copious lap of the fre&s;he&s;t flowers, Ama|ryllis tenderly chided him: and oft with a &s;igh complained to Lycidas, that their trees were without fruit, and their &s;oil without flowers.</P>
<P>She had lamented &s;o frequently that he never brought &s;ufficient ro&s;es and hyacinths, that one day, having found a ro&s;e-tree who&s;e roots had been loo&s;ened in the &s;oil, he ea&s;ily extracted it, and threw it at the feet of Ama|ryllis. She exclaimed:&mdash;Beauteous family of flowers, ye will all peri&s;h at once! For your violated and tender &s;ociety, &s;evered from your natal &s;pots, pine in a foreign air; while ye yield your &s;oothing odours, no ma|ternal earth will &s;upply you with new &s;ources of exi&s;tence; every breath of air ye fill with &s;weetne&s;s, and in every breath ye are dying: prodigal of your cheri&s;hed exi&s;tence, a tender regret di&s;turbs us in the moment of plea&s;ure. Lycidas, I will bury them in the &s;od that covers the lamb we buried la&s;t week.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="329">
She made a cavity in the earth, in which &s;he depo&s;ited the ro&s;e-tree. The <HI>tran&s;planted</HI> ro&s;es &s;truck their roots in the &s;oil; the bu&s;h flouri&s;hed to their wondering eye, and graced their habitation with its &s;olitary beauty. An|other di&s;covery! more ro&s;es and more hya|cinths! Every plea&s;ing plant they met in their walks became domiciliated; they pa&s;&s;ed hours in herbali&s;ing; and in the &s;ucceeding &s;ummer the fore&s;t air was &s;weetened with new odours, and a FLOWER-GARDEN em|belli&s;hed their &s;olitude<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Tran&s;plantation,</HI> &s;o natural an idea in an age of culture, appears not to occur to the minds of tho&s;e who have made little progre&s;s in the agricultural art. The following anec|dote &s;eems to confirm this ob&s;ervation:&mdash;Niebuhr tells us, in his Travels through Arabia, that <Q REND="inline">"Mr. For&s;kal often vi&s;ited the Kiaja, and <HI>per&s;uaded</HI> him <HI>to form a garden</HI> for plants near his hou&s;e, and to bring, from the interior parts of the country, the &s;hrub which produces the balm of Mecca. The Arabs looked upon this <HI>as a very happy thought;</HI> and the more &s;o, becau&s;e the balm is not to be obtained pure at Jidda."</Q> Vol. i. p. 229.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>But to have thus accidentally di&s;covered the arts of <HI>planting</HI> and <HI>tran&s;planting,</HI> was not &s;ufficient for the propagation of their trees.
<PB N="303" REF="330">
Their <HI>horticulture</HI> was &s;till imperfect. They perceived, with equal di&s;appointment and &s;ur|pri&s;e, that the vines mo&s;t luxuriant in leaves, were barren; while others, of thinner foliage, were prodigal of fruit. Amaryllis wondered, and Lycidas reflected. He ob&s;erved that the vine, yielding the mo&s;t abundant fruit, was one which a favourite goat was allowed to browze. He ob&s;erved; he meditated; he &s;tole the hint. He lopped the branches of the vines. And it was the GOAT who fir&s;t &s;hewed to MAN the ART OF PRUNING.</P>
<P>The procuring of wild honey from the cavities of old trees and the clefts of rocks, was often an uncertain pur&s;uit and an in&s;uf|ficient re&s;ource. Another inquietude, an|other want, another invention!</P>
<P>They watched a little populace of &s;oraging bees bu&s;y on their ambro&s;ial repa&s;t, &s;poiling the farina of flowers or pre&s;&s;ing the tops of the &s;tamina, and thus anticipating the cau|tious oeconomy of Nature. The amu&s;ing &s;ound! when they plunge their little velvet
<PB N="304" REF="331">
heads in the calix of a flower, and pierce through the re&s;i&s;ting petal, while the &s;udden &s;ilence expre&s;&s;es the ardent pillage. Did they track the vagrants to their waxen tower? There, a new idea of SOCIETY gave a &s;ub|lime emotion to our two &s;olitaries. They traced order in a multitude; they viewed a city and its inhabitants; and, with a deli|cious joy, Amaryllis di&s;covered the queen|bee. She exclaimed, in contemplating their &s;ymmetrical, &s;olid, and convenient cells; tho&s;e finely planned edifices for thou&s;ands of the living,&mdash;Lycidas, thou mu&s;t acknowledge the <HI>architecture</HI> of the little bees is more wonder|ful than thine.&mdash;It is more perfect (replied Lycidas); for the&s;e fabrics are ju&s;t adapted to their inmates, while in our palace there are a hundred things to add and to amend.</P>
<P>They in&s;tructed them&s;elves in the HUMAN PASSIONS (of which they were &s;trangers to many) in meditating on this &s;ociety. Innu|merable offices of affection penetrated their hearts with the &s;en&s;ibility of humanity.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="332">
Lycidas having ob&s;erved that the bees were ever &s;ettling on aromatic plants, on the thyme, the ro&s;emary, the &s;age, and re&s;ted long on the flowers of the lime, he planted, on the &s;outhern &s;teep of his valley, nume|rous beds of balmy flowers, and odoriferous herbs.&mdash;Want (&s;aid Lycidas), and not caprice, urges their re&s;tle&s;s flight; they are not vola|tile, but diligent. I can afford the wanderers a re&s;ting &s;pot; perhaps they may make it a home; and we will interchange our mutual indu&s;try.</P>
<P>What he imagined, &s;ucceeded. The ex|plorers of &s;weets &s;oon di&s;covered the new world; the aromatic land in&s;pired a thou|&s;and adventurers, who, con&s;tant to plea&s;ure, knew no other native &s;pot, than where plea|&s;ure was found. The queen followed the co|lony; they then built their cells, and peopled, with dark clu&s;ters, the pendent boughs. The voice of the bee was mu&s;ical beneath the &s;olitary heaven of our lovers. Such was
<PB N="306" REF="333">
the origin of an APIARY, or BEE GAR|DEN<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Saint Pierre has given a hint how an <HI>aviary</HI> might have been formed.

<P>They had now much advanced in the art of painting; but as they only employed their pencils from a &s;pirit of gaiety, and a pa&s;&s;ion for decoration, the &s;ublime inventions of the art were not yet conceived; the ideal was unknown, but the exacte&s;t imitation was practi&s;ed. They knew well to copy the purple bloom of the fruit as it hung on the tree, and the brilliant tint of the flower, as it caught the &s;unbeam on its native &s;talk. They had mutually attempted to paint their own portraits; but the progre&s;s of &s;uch an elaborate piece had ever been interrupted by the tedious labour of the un&s;killed arti&s;t and the re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of the lively model. With more &s;ucce&s;s they copied animals and in&s;ects.

But LOVE had in&s;pired Lycidas to adorn the corner of the apartment occupied by Ama|ryllis. There he continually &s;ketched the thou&s;and capricious images dancing in his brain. The curious wall was gradually cover|ed with fanta&s;tic forms, and exhibited a con|&s;tant &s;pectacle of fancy. Now the bower of Amaryllis was there elegantly fe&s;tooned, and the tendrils of vines were happily flouri&s;hed by a &s;troke of the pencil; now, as his hu|mour prompted, the fibres of the leaves were tran&s;parently laboured, while, on a delicate &s;tem, hung the fini&s;hed petal of an unfini&s;hed flower: &s;ometimes he copied a &s;ilken white fillet, with which Amaryllis circled her head|dre&s;s, binding it with &s;carlet flowers, glowing in the mid&s;t of their green leaves; &s;ometimes he laboriou&s;ly fini&s;hed chimerical figures, which partly re&s;embled human forms, but frequently terminated in that of &s;ome ani|mal, or wore &s;ome ridiculous di&s;proportion, provoking laughter; and &s;ometimes the face of the volatile Amaryllis ending with the
<PB N="308" REF="335">
plumage of a bird, or the mottled wings of a butterfly. It was now a torrent foaming on rocks, and now a rivulet &s;haded with elms, who&s;e &s;ilvery line was poured through the tran&s;parent umbrage. Every object they admired in their walks, on his return was &s;ketched or fini&s;hed on the wall. 'Twas now a tree, a pro&s;pect, or the clouds! But the Loves and the Graces often guided his deliriums of imagination, and the wall re|corded the &s;hort annals of their lives, and pictured the epochas of his various inven|tions. There, were &s;een the fir&s;t over&s;etting of the fi&s;h of wood; there him&s;elf breathing his fir&s;t flute, and Amaryllis &s;ketching his fir&s;t &s;hade. The fanta&s;tic &s;cenery, airy or &s;olemn, &s;ketched or elaborate, in&s;pired mirth, fancy, and love. Such was the origin of the playful ARABESQUES, Or GROTESQUE PAINTINGS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The ARABESQUES, in a <HI>boudoir</HI> of RAPHAEL, where he pa&s;&s;ed his delicious hours with his favourite mi&s;tre&s;s <HI>For|narina,</HI> gave the hint of <HI>this incident.</HI> He covered the wall with a number of little genii, gamboling and fri&s;king on &s;talks, tendrils, twigs, and flouri&s;hes, all marked by &s;trong ge&s;ticulations: there is al&s;o an allegorical picture emblematic of the violence of the pa&s;&s;ions, and to the Pa&s;&s;ions Raphael became an enchanting victim. The bu&s;t of his mi&s;tre&s;s is repeated &s;everal times among the&s;e fond and &s;portive recre|ations of the painter of ideal beauty. In Newton's &s;plendid edition of Vitruvius the curious reader will find the &s;enti|ments of the ancient architect on grote&s;que paintings.&mdash;See p. 163. It may be u&s;eful to inform &s;ome readers, that <HI>gro|te&s;ques</HI> are ornaments of mere caprice, variegated with figures of animals, foliage, flowers, and chimerical objects. They have been cen&s;ured as <HI>unnatural;</HI> it is, however, ea&s;y to con|ceive how happily they can be arranged by a fine ta&s;te and a rich fancy. There are &s;ome beautiful ones among the en|gravings of the Herculaneum.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="336">
Around their hou&s;e was an ornamented &s;cenery; but as they &s;ometimes bewildered them&s;elves in the neighbouring valleys, or were de&s;irous of indicating &s;ome particular &s;pot, they invented LOCAL NAMES, which were derived from &s;ome circum&s;tance. One place was di&s;tingui&s;hed by <HI>the Ki&s;s;</HI> and an|other, where Amaryllis, in eluding Lycidas, as he chaced the laughing fugitive, tumbled down the hill, was called <HI>the Fall;</HI> a fine walk near the lake, through hedges of the arbutus, was known by the name of <HI>the Strawberry Walk;</HI> and a valley, luxuriant in
<PB N="310" REF="337">
flowers, by the title of <HI>the Summer Seat.</HI> There was a favourite &s;pot called <HI>the Ruins of May.</HI> One morning in that month Ama|ryllis lay there a&s;leep; Lycidas pa&s;&s;ed, and ob&s;erved the indolent maid. He ha&s;tened to the hedges, which were then in full flower, and de&s;poiled them; and having gathered a panier full of May blo&s;&s;oms, he quietly co|vered the &s;leeping beauty with their fragrant &s;nows. She awoke in a cloud of &s;teaming odours, while her plea&s;ure-twinkling eye wondered at the flowery ve&s;t that covered her. Chiding her playful lover for this wa&s;te of the young year, the fact was re|corded in the name given to the place, thence called "<HI>The Ruins of May.</HI>" A &s;imilar origin is that of mo&s;t LOCAL NAMES.</P>
<P>What now remained to perfect the felicity of our two &s;olitaries? Their earth was tinted with brilliant flowers; their trees bowed their branches with delicious fruit; their air was mu&s;ical with the volant bee; they glided on the river with a happy audacity; the melo|dies
<PB N="311" REF="338">
of the nightingale were in their flutes; the con&s;olation of ab&s;ence was found in the pictured form, and the gaiety of a playful pencil embodied their fanta&s;tic imaginations; the charm of an artificial echo re&s;ounded in their ver&s;es, while they traced in their palace the columns which memori&s;ed their affec|tions. The enchanting miraclcs of ART long fa&s;cinated their eye, vibrating in their hearts the tranquil emotions of beauty; while the innocent voluptuou&s;ne&s;s which Nature threw around them, &s;olicited their enjoyment. Often they now turned from the productions of Nature and of Art, to gaze on each other: an interior &s;en&s;ation, an unknown de&s;ire, a querulous anxiety, exi&s;ted in their hearts, and every day their felicity was dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>One day, as they &s;at be&s;ide an expan&s;ive lake, they beheld TWO SWANS &s;ailing on the &s;tream; images of maje&s;ty, of grace, and of peace! Our lovers reclined, admiring each form of elegance, and the luminous white|ne&s;s of their plumage, and all the variety
<PB N="312" REF="339">
and freedom of their animated attitudes. The male was intent to attract the admira|tion of the female; anxious to di&s;cover the concealed graces of his beauty, yet anxious with pride. He arranges his &s;plendid plu|mage; he throws the trailing water from his beak along his &s;hining back and over his fre&s;hened wings with the fond &s;olicitude of that being who knows the plea&s;ure of being loved. All his figure re&s;pires voluptuou&s;|ne&s;s. He approaches her; he flaps his pi|nions, and the feathery &s;now &s;parkles. With a preluding care&s;s, they wind their &s;inuous necks around each other; their wings yield a confu&s;ed &s;ound, and &s;ome white feathers fall on the di&s;turbed lake. A continued em|brace unites them. They pur&s;ue each inter|change of delight; they feel all the &s;hades of &s;en&s;ibility, and faint in the ebriety of the &s;en&s;es. At length the male is no more ma|je&s;tic; he is only tender, and lies indolently along the trembling waters. Again the fe|male returns to her lover; again inflames
<PB N="313" REF="340">
him; again incites his la&s;t ardours; and only quits him, reluctantly, but to plunge into the &s;tream, and to extingui&s;h the fires that &s;till glow in her agitated form<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buffon's &s;ublime de&s;cription of the CAMEL journeying through the de&s;ert, has been di&s;tingui&s;hed by the eulogium of Gibbon. His de&s;cription of the SWAN may de&s;erve an equal, though a different applau&s;e. It abounds with the rich and voluptuous poetry of a philo&s;ophic imagination; always exact, yet always beautiful.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>When the LOVERS had gazed on the af|fectionate SWANS, they turned to each other, and &s;ighed. Lycidas &s;natched &s;ome feathers of the &s;wans as they floated by them, and ki&s;&s;ed them.&mdash;How they know (he cries) to love, and to render their love the &s;ource of their felicity! O, Amaryllis! why is not the &s;en&s;e of our exi&s;tence the &s;en&s;e of our happine&s;s! Shall we become old without having known enjoyment?</P>
<P>Children of Nature! the univer&s;al parent prepares for ye the maturity of happine&s;s! &s;he gives ye the &s;oft pains ye now &s;uffer, to render the fine plea&s;ures &s;he will be&s;tow on ye, more exqui&s;ite and pure. It is only in a
