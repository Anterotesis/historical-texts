<HEAD>THE Lover's Treat: or, UNNATURAL HATRED, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<P>IN this la&s;t Century there has been no Vice more gene|rally rooted in the Minds of Men than a Di&s;cordency in Families, and which flows from the very Springs, from which we &s;hould naturally expect to find the mo&s;t agreeable Harmony; but Intere&s;t who&s;e Power is invincible, too frequently creates us Enemies where we are mo&s;t nearly and Con&s;anguinity, which ought mo&s;t e&s;pecially to endear to each other, is now become a &s;tanding Maxim to forget tho&s;e tender Principles which Nature claims, and the World mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily approve.</P>
<P>This unfortunate Depravity of Sen&s;e, laid want of frater|nal Affection, was the unhappy Cau&s;e of many Sufferings and &s;evere&s;t Hard&s;hips, which a very worthy Youth for many Years endured; and from whom I had a particular Account of a long Series of Mi&s;ery occa&s;ioned by his elder Brother, and &s;ince I have his Permi&s;&s;ion, will give a &s;uccinct Account both of him and his Family.</P>
<P>This young Gentleman was the &s;econd and la&s;t Son of Mr. <HI>Anthony El&s;tone,</HI> born of a very reputable Family in <HI>Glouce&s;ter|&s;hire,</HI> and who&s;e Father was a wealthy Grazier, worth a con|&s;iderable
<PB N="4" REF="3">
Deal of Money, but having a very large Family to whom he paid an equal regard: He portion'd out his Sons and Daughters alike, often declaring that one Child was as dear to him as another: and that what he was worth was the happy Effects of his own Indu&s;try, &s;o he was determined to di&s;po&s;e it in &s;uch a Manner, that no Envy &s;hould ari&s;e a|mong his Children from his Partiality, having ten of them, he left to each when died One Thou&s;and Pounds a piece; and as a farther Proof of his paternal Affection, (his Wife dying when the Younge&s;t of his Offspring was but two Years of Age) he re&s;olved never to make a &s;econd Choice, in re&s;pect to the Memory of a very worthy Woman, and a fond Regard to the infant Blood &s;he left behind her; he look'd on every Child as a particular Ble&s;&s;ing &s;ent from Heaven, and as &s;uch re&s;olved never to put it in the Power of a Mother-in-Law to contra|dict his pious Purpo&s;es in acting like a tender Father, or enu|merating his I&s;&s;ue: And con&s;equently, obliging him&s;elf to di|ve&s;t tho&s;e he had Part of their natural Rights, to provide for a foreign Stock.</P>
<P>Many Years before he died he had the Happinne&s;s of &s;eeing even the Younge&s;t of his Children di&s;po&s;ed of in different Callings, and &s;et up for them&s;elves; among&s;t which Mr. <HI>An|thony El&s;lone,</HI> his Younge&s;t, was well e&s;tabli&s;hed in Merchandize in the City of <HI>London;</HI> and behaving extreamly well in his Clerk&s;hip; he married a Niece of his Ma&s;ter's, who was a Dependant on her Uncle, who gave her to Mr. <HI>El&s;tone,</HI> with a Fortune of Two Thou&s;and Pounds; and would have done more but that he had a Family of his own to provide for, by this young Gentlewoman he had &s;everal little ones, all of whom died in their Infancy, except the la&s;t three, <HI>viz. An|thony</HI> the Elde&s;t, <HI>George</HI> the &s;econd Son, and <HI>Jane</HI> their la&s;t and only Daughter, who were Twins.</P>
<P><HI>Anthony</HI> and <HI>George</HI> were as oppo&s;ite in their Di&s;po&s;itions as Fire and Water, the elder being the fir&s;t that lived up to a Twelvemonth, the fond Parents by an over acted Indulgence,
<PB N="5" REF="4">
ruined his Principles which in Infancy might have been Cul|tivated to have rendered him, the rever&s;e of which be proved, by that Time he was &s;ix Years of Age he was ab&s;olute Ma|&s;ter of the Family, and was pa&s;&s;ed off as Life and Spirit in one &s;o Young, very &s;oon made him hateful and contemptible to all about him, except his Father and Mother; in about four Years after his Birth their &s;econd Son and only Daughter made their Appearance in the World, to the un&s;peakable tran&s;port of their Parents, and the Admiration of all who be|held them, being without Exception, two of the fine&s;t Children that even were born at one Birth. Young as <HI>Anthony</HI> was he conceived an Aver&s;ion for his little Brother and Si&s;ter, and grew jealous at the Sight of them: this rancourous Di&s;po&s;i|tion grew up with him, and &s;trengthened with his Years, the other two who&s;e tender Di&s;po&s;itions and Affability of Soul, inclined them to love each other, al&s;o excited them to &s;ue for <HI>Anthony'</HI> Affection, but all in vain, he openly declared his Aver&s;ion thro' every Action of his Life, and &s;everal Times, even at Play attempting to maim or de&s;troy them. This wicked Di&s;po&s;ition was once the Occa&s;ion of his Father's &s;trip|ping him &s;tark-naked and di&s;ciplin'd him with a Hor&s;ewhip till he <HI>had</HI> almo&s;t left him for dead; it happen'd Mr. <HI>El&s;ione</HI> luckily went into the Room when he was within an Inch of ru&s;hing a &s;harp Penknife into his Brother's Throat, which na|turally enraged the Father and urged him to excu&s;e the fore|mentioned Ju&s;tice on him.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;anding Mr. <HI>El&s;tone</HI>'s Rea&s;on convienced him of the Ju&s;tice of the Puni&s;hment he had inflicted, yet when his Anger &s;ub&s;ided. Fondne&s;s then prevailed and reduced the pi|teous Father to an immoderate Flood of Angui&s;h and repene|ant Tears for having proceeded with &s;uch Vigiour to his dar|ling worthle&s;s Son. Ma&s;ter <HI>George</HI> tenderly pleaded for his Brother, and would have prevented the dreadful Stripes he un|derwent, but even that wrought no Effect upon the Mind of this young Barbarian; for he remembered the Smart of the
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<HI>Whip</HI> to a long and cruel Detriment to his Brother's Intere&s;t and Reputation.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>El&s;tone</HI> had been often heard to declare his Intention of providing for his Family by the worthy Example of his Father, this catch'd the Ears of his Son <HI>Anthony</HI> who from twelve Years of Age to Maturity, indu&s;triou&s;ly employed his Thoughts to Engro&s;s the <HI>Whole</HI> of what his <HI>Father</HI> &s;hould die po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. To which End he made it his con&s;tant Bu&s;ine&s;s to influence his Father again&s;t his Brother <HI>George,</HI> who&s;e con|tinual Obedience and Regard made it a very difficult Task. For Example: Even in Infancy he was unexceptionably en|dearing to his Parents through a continued Cour&s;e of Good-Nature, at the &s;ame Time giving promi&s;ing Hopes of an ex|traordinary Undertaking, when ripen'd into Years; in his School Days he made his Studies his peculiar Care, and by that Time he arrived to the Age of Sixteen, was Ma&s;ter of &s;everal Languages; and as he was de&s;igned to follow his Fa|ther's Bu&s;ine&s;s clo&s;ely, applied him&s;elf to the perfect Know|ledge of Merchants Accompts, of which he is ju&s;tly e&s;teem|ed to be at this Time the compleate&s;t Ma&s;ter in <HI>Great-Bri|tain.</HI></P>
<P>His Brother <HI>Anthony</HI> was as entirely regardle&s;s of every Advantage of this Nature, Mi&s; making chief and Plea&s;ure his only Study; and having from the Hour of his Birth gain'd &s;uch an A&s;cendency over the Hearts of both his Parents, they found it an impacticable Scheme ever to get the better of that Power their mi&s;taken Fondne&s;s had inve&s;ted him with&punc; Mr. <HI>El&s;tone</HI> was too plainly convinced of the rancourous Di&s;po&s;iti|on of <HI>Anthony</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> inoffen&s;ive Brother, therefore tenderly ad|moni&s;h'd his Son <HI>George</HI> to be contented with being put Ap|prentice to &s;ome other Merchant to prevent any Feuds or Ani|mo&s;ities between 'em, tho' he originally de&s;igned to have bound him to him&s;elf. The good <HI>Youth</HI> received his Father's Advice with that dutiful Re&s;pect that became him, tho' &s;orry to be obliged to leave his Father, and greatly affected with
<PB N="7" REF="6">
the unnatural and cruel Motive of their Separation. In a &s;hort Time Mr. <HI>George</HI> was put Clerk to one Mr. <HI>Hume,</HI> an eminent <HI>Hamburgh</HI> Merchant, and &s;eldom vi&s;ited home above twice or thrice a Year, tho' Mr <HI>El&s;tone</HI> often went to &s;ee him; this Removal any rea&s;onable Per&s;on would have thought might have made his <HI>Brother</HI> perfectly ea&s;y, but &s;o far from it, the con&s;tant Prai&s;es he heard of his <HI>Brother</HI>'s good Behaviour and A&s;&s;iduity in his Busine&s;s greatly corroded his Mind, as he knew that this univer&s;al good Character mu&s;t entirely fru&s;trate all his wicked Intents of depriving him of his Birth right, and that any Fal&s;hoods he could alledge again&s;t him mu&s;t con&s;e|quently prove ineffectual; but in order to give Birth to his cruel Purpo&s;es, he &s;uddenly put on a Mask of Friend&s;hip and feign'd a hearty Repentance for his unnatural Behaviour to his <HI>Brother,</HI> earne&s;tly reque&s;ting his Father to become his Advo|cate to poor <HI>George,</HI> and endeavour at his Reconciliation with him. Mr. <HI>El&s;tone</HI> and his Wife were plea&s;ingly amazed at this wonderful and happy Charge in their Son's temper, and without delay &s;ent for the other home to clo&s;e this unlucky Breach, and &s;ix a wi&s;h'd for Friend&s;hip between the <HI>Brothers.</HI> Mr. <HI>El&s;tene</HI> urged his Son <HI>Anthony</HI> to write, but the artful vil|lain pretended he &s;hould be at a Lo&s;s to Expre&s;s him&s;elf in a Manner &s;uitable to his Offence, and begged his Father for that Rea&s;on to do it for him, to which he joyfully agreed as follows:<LETTER>

<P><HI>'TIS with amazing and un&s;peakable Tran&s;port I inform you that your Brother</HI> Anthony <HI>is at la&s;t grown &s;en&s;ible of his Error, and feels &s;o &s;trong Compunction for his ill grounded Aver&s;ion to you; he can no longer forbear &s;uing for a Reconcilia|tion, and as he confe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf unequal to the Task of moving for it as he ought, has entreated me to be his Mediator: I don't in this Ca&s;e u&s;e the Commands of a Parent, but the tender Ad|monition of a Friend, which I hope will be &s;ufficiently prevalent on your Good-Nature, to come on the Receipt of this to fix a la&s;t|ing</HI>

</LETTER></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>George</HI>'s good Sen&s;e and Sweetne&s;s of Temper was ea&s;i|ly moved to obey his Father's plea&s;ing Summons, and went directly with the Servant who brought the Letter to him. On his approaching to embrace his deceitful <HI>Brother,</HI> he &s;hewed the real Signs of Love, real Pity and Forgivene&s;s, while the the other artfully &s;train'd from his Eyes the Crocodile's pre|tending Sorrow, which influenced the generous <HI>Youth</HI> to pay a &s;incere and grateful Retribution flowing from the Re&s;ult of an <HI>hone&s;t</HI> Heart, and Joy un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">eign'd.</P>
<P><HI>When his Brother attempted to make Confe&s;&s;ion of his Error, he would not permit him to proceed in, but with the polite&s;t Tenderne&s;s de&s;ired him to regard but as a Dream what had pa&s;&s;ed, and make at once to all the Tran&s;port of belonging, and being beloved by a truly affectionate Friend and Brother.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. <HI>El&s;tone</HI> with their agreeable <HI>Daughter</HI> bore an equal Part in this plea&s;ing Di&s;tre&s;s, for &s;uch <HI>they</HI> thought it to be in regard to Mr. <HI>Anthony,</HI> who affected every Symp|tom without feeling the &s;malle&s;t Degree of it; <HI>however,</HI> it pa&s;&s;ed current upon the worthy Part of <HI>the</HI> Family, who were e&s;olved on <HI>this</HI> &s;eeming Happine&s;s to celebate it <HI>with</HI> a Fe&s;tival; and as <HI>the</HI> Di&s;cord between <HI>the&s;e Brothers</HI> was uni|ver&s;ally known among <HI>their</HI> Friends and Acquaintance: Many of <HI>them</HI> were invited to a publick Rejoicing, each congratu|lating the <HI>whole</HI> Family on &s;o laudable and rea&s;onable a Re|conciliation.</P>
<P><HI>'Tis nece&s;&s;ary to inform the Reader that Mr.</HI> George <HI>and Mi&s;s</HI> Jenny, <HI>who came together into the World, went Hand in Hand in every Point of Brother and Si&s;terly Affection, and on</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="8">
<HI>&s;uch Terms as ought to &s;tand for an Example to all &s;uch Re|lations, though &s;ingly born: But alas! tho&s;e Principles are lo&s;t in this pre&s;ent Age, and is almo&s;t deemed a Crime in &s;ome Fa|milies to he related to them.</HI></P>
<P>The tender Regard this young Gentleman and his Si&s;ter from Infancy pre&s;erved for each other, tho' entirely innocent and infallible, was the fir&s;t Motive thro' the Villainy of <HI>An|thony</HI> to their long and unprecedented Sufferings.</P>
<P>The Day appointed for their public Rejoicing being come, among their numerous Friends were Mr. <HI>George</HI>'s Ma&s;ter, and his only Son, who had for very near a Twelvemonth paid his Addre&s;&s;es to Mi&s;s <HI>Jenny,</HI> by Con&s;ent of both Parties, who thought proper to defer their Marriage till her Admirer had &s;erved his Clerk&s;hip, which he did to his Father, by which Time he would arrive to the Age of Two and Twenty, and the young Lady to about Nineteen. As they were happy in the Knowledge of being de&s;igned for each other, entirely cor|re&s;pondent to their Wi&s;hes, they pa&s;&s;ed their Time with a|greeable Chearfulne&s;s, and a plea&s;ing Reflection of being one Day till Death to be rendered in&s;eparab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e; they were &s;o near their de&s;tin'd Happine&s;s, that it wanted but three Months to confirm it, which was Part of the Di&s;cour&s;e at their Fea&s;t, and gave Birth to a very barbarous Plot, both on them and poor Mr. <HI>George,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Anthony</HI> put in force.</P>
<P><HI>Mr.</HI> El&s;tone <HI>being re&s;olved to expre&s;s the Fullne&s;s of his Joy on this Occa&s;ion, concluded his Entertainment with a Ball, and becau&s;e Mi&s;s</HI> Jenny <HI>would not &s;eem particular, cho&s;e her Bro|ther</HI> George <HI>for a Partner in&s;tead of young Mr</HI> Hume, <HI>her in|tended Husband. 'Tis true he entreated her to dance with him, but &s;he mode&s;tly declined it for the formentioned Rea&s;on, as Peo|ple are apt to take Notice of every Look and Action of a young Couple &s;o near Marriage.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9">
Accordingly Mr. <HI>George</HI> and his Si&s;ter both of whom danced mo&s;t exce&s;&s;ively genteel, open'd the Ball with a Minuet and Louvre, and continued Partners for the Night, the whole Company were in a Flow of Spi its and good Humour, ex|cept the villainous Hypocrite, on who&s;e Account the&s;e good|natured People were all a&s;&s;embled; next Day this Mon&s;ter of Inhumanity and Fal&s;hood, goes to pay a Vi&s;it at Mr. <HI>Hume</HI>'s under a Pretence of &s;trengthening that Affection he had the Night before wav'd for his injured Brother, he &s;taid &s;ome Time expatiating on <HI>George</HI>'s kind forgiving Nature, and condemn|ing his own mi&s;taken Folly in being blind to &s;o much Merit, and ob&s;tinately depriving him&s;elf for &s;o many Years of his fraternal Love and Friend&s;hip. During <HI>his</HI> &s;tay at Mr. <HI>Hume</HI>'s, Mr. <HI>George El&s;lone</HI> was obliged to go out for an Hour upon Bu&s;ine&s;s of very great Con&s;equence, but made his Brother promi&s;e to &s;tay and pa&s;s the Evening with <HI>them;</HI> to which <HI>he</HI> readily agreed: While Mr. <HI>George</HI> was gone, young Mr. <HI>Hume</HI>'s Fondne&s;s naturally turn'd his Di&s;cour&s;e upon dear Mi&s;s <HI>Jenny,</HI> expre&s;&s;ing the tendere&s;t Regard for her, and the Hap|pine&s;s he promi&s;ed to him&s;elf when he &s;hould become her Hu&s;|band.

However, you may depend on this Friend <HI>George,</HI> while I am ma&s;ter of a Shilling neither you or mi&s;s <HI>Jenny</HI> &s;hall want, though &s;aid he, &s;ighing, Heaven only knows how long that may be, for Things are not with me now as formerly, as indeed it &s;oon after proved, for the poor Gentleman was in about &s;ix weeks Time obliged to &s;tep a&s;ide, and all he was worth in the world was not &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the large Demands upon him, which was chiefly occa&s;ioned through con&s;iderable Lo&s;&s;es in Trade.</P>
<P><HI>This unlucky &s;troke of Fortune drove poor</HI> George <HI>and his Si&s;ter into the wide World, but they never &s;eparated, &s;hifting for three Years as well as they could for daily Bread: Mi&s;s</HI> Jenny <HI>earned what &s;he could by her Needle, at be&s;t poor Sub&s;i&s;tance. And her Brother, who&s;e Credit was broke among&s;t the merchants, under|took to teach tho&s;e Accompts, and kept a little School, but with much Difficulty between them both could rai&s;e even a homely live|lihood.</HI></P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Grimes upon her misfortune went to mr. Anthony El|&s;tone to claim his Promi&s;e of the Five Hundred Pound, which be would have declined as not being in immediate Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Fortune, but &s;he in&s;i&s;ted on a Bond, which he gave her out of Fear of a Di&s;covery: As to his Si&s;ter &s;he was concluded to have peri&s;hed by the Fire, as they had never heard any Thing of her &s;ince.</HI></P>

<HEAD>As Providence has in it&s;elf &s;everal wonderful and &s;urpri&s;ing Turns, I mu&s;t now give a very remarkable In&s;tance of its Care of poor <HI>George</HI> and his Si&s;ter <HI>Jane.</HI></HEAD>
<P>GEORGE's Reputation having been &s;o cruelly bla&s;ted in <HI>the</HI> City, He cho&s;e to re&s;ide at a different End of the Town, for which Rea&s;on he took a couple of Rooms in one of the little Streets near <HI>Red Lion Square,</HI> and in an Even|ing in the Summer Time would frequently take a walk with his Si&s;ter up as far as <HI>Pancras;</HI> and at the End of one of <HI>Red-Lion Fields,</HI> he had for many weeks ob&s;erved a venerable clean old man, who did not ask Charity, but bowed with a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive &s;upplicating Look that claimed a Human Regard from every Pa&s;&s;er by, among the re&s;t poor <HI>George</HI> and <HI>Jenny</HI> as often as they could would throw in their mites, and with &s;o tender and compa&s;&s;ionate an Air, it &s;eemed rather an Ob|ligation to them&s;elves than to the Per&s;on on whom they be|&s;towed their kind Benevolence; the poor old man had taken particular Notice of this couple whom he took for man and wife, but ob&s;erved &s;omething in their A&s;pect and Deportment that declared them what they really were, two well bred di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed People, and re&s;olved within him&s;elf the next Time he &s;aw them to be better acquainted with them. Soon after they took their Evening walk, and the old man &s;pying them at a Di&s;tance, made towards them and met them half way the Field: my good ma&s;ter, &s;aid he, I beg pardon for &s;topping you, but <HI>I</HI> have been often obliged to your friendly Charity, and am now come to thank you for it in a particular manner, and if you will conde&s;cend to give a poor man your Com|pany for few moments, I'll conduct you to a Hou&s;e where we

And upon hear|ing they were only Brother and Si&s;ter, they perceived an un|u&s;ual Joy &s;parkle in his Eyes, and begged the Favour of mi&s;s <HI>Jenny</HI> to favour him with the Privilege of &s;aluting her, which &s;he did, and now, madam, <HI>&s;aid he.</HI> give me Leave to inform you that though I live by Charity, I am better able to be&s;tow it than three Parts of tho&s;e from whom <HI>I</HI> receive

<P><HI>I</HI> own, madam, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> this is a &s;udden Attack upon your mode&s;ty, but as it flows from the Re&s;ult of a tender Pa&s;|&s;ion <HI>I</HI> have for &s;ome weeks pa&s;t &s;u&s;tained for you, <HI>I</HI> hope you will excu&s;e this quick manner of reque&s;ting the only.

Now, Sir, our misfortunes <HI>have</HI> taught us rather to increa&s;e that Store of Friend&s;hip we imbibed from infancy, therefore thro' every Change of Life <HI>I</HI> am re&s;olved to be a faithful Guar|dian to my Si&s;ter's Honour, and protect her even at Life's Expence from any Danger &s;he may be liable to, not that <HI>I</HI> &s;u&s;pect any ill from You Sir, and hope You will not be offend|ed at my cautious Care for &s;o dear and near a Relation. No, Sir, replied the other, <HI>I</HI> rather applaud than condemn You for it; but as Earne&s;t of my Truth, I beg, Sir, You will do me the favour to accept of this Trifle for Your pre|&s;ent U&s;e (putting into his Hand a Silk Pur&s;e with fifty Guineas in it.) To-morrow <HI>I</HI> de&s;ire to &s;ee You and this fair Lady at my Hou&s;e by Dinner; plea&s;e to enquire for mr.

Si&s;ter's Expectations. I won't detain you longer but beg you to con&s;ider well on what I have of|fered, and know me hereafter as a Friend, and I hope a Brother; they took leave, and the Gentle|man re&s;umed his venerable Appearance, and di&s;|charging the reckoning he went to his Stand till Evening, and went home well plea&s;ed at his Af|ternoon's Adventure. Mr. <HI>George</HI> had a great deal of Rea&s;on to conceive a high Opinion of his new Acquaintance, and advi&s;ed his Si&s;ter to re&s;olve upon the Match, which &s;he promis'd to do in ca&s;e every thing an&s;wer'd to what he had told them.</P>
<P>Next Day he went to <HI>Dean-&s;treet,</HI> and upon the Coach &s;topping at the Door, was open'd by a foot|man in a lac'd Livery before the Coachman could get off his Box; and Mr <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> dre&s;s'd like a Man of Fa&s;hion ready to hand the Lady in, whom he conducted into a very hand&s;ome Dining-Room &s;plendidly Furni&s;hed, and at one End a noble Sideboard of Plate fit for a Nobleman: Now, Madam, &s;aid he, permit me to bid you welcome to your Hou&s;e for that, and all that it contains is Your's if you plea&s;e to except of it; &s;he bow'd and blu&s;h'd, and Mr. <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> continu'd paying his Addre&s;&s;es in the polite&s;t Manner po&s;|&s;ible, Dinner was &s;erved, at which there was fif|teen Di&s;hes, five at a Cour&s;e with the be&s;t the Sea&s;on of the Year afforded, when that Ceremony was over Mr. <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> brought Mr <HI>El&s;tone</HI> a Pocket

Book, out of which he counted out Bank Notes to the amount of upwards of forty Thou&s;and Pounds, which he and his Father before him had ama&s;s'd by begging; yet this is not all that I am worth, for I have &s;everal Hou&s;es, and have often received charity from my tenants in their coaches, who at the &s;ame Time did not know they were relieving their Landlord. I have but one Servant belonging to me that knows any thing of my Cour&s;e of Life, and he's an old Fellow that lived with my Father before my Remembrance: he al|ways attends me to our Hou&s;e of Rendezvous, and is principal Secretary of our begging State, in &s;hort, they pa&s;s'd the Afternoon with a Reci|tal of both their Fortunes; and Mr. <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> heard of the Cruelty of <HI>George</HI> and <HI>Jenny</HI>'s Fate he &s;hed a kind, commi&s;erating Tear for both, but mo&s;t e&s;pecially for Mi&s;s <HI>Jenny,</HI> whom he loved, and was plea&s;ed to find &s;he had an equal &s;hare of &s;en&s;e and beauty: After <HI>they</HI> had told their &s;eparate Tales, Mr. <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> reque&s;ted 'em to pa&s;s the E|vening, and as Mr. <HI>El&s;tone</HI> was perfectly con|vinc'd of his being in all Points capable of mak|ing his Si&s;ter happy On Mr. <HI>Corni&s;h</HI>'s moving his &s;uit again, 'twas concluded in a few Days to fix their Widding, which was at <HI>Queen's-Square</HI> Cha|pel, near <HI>Ormond-&s;treet;</HI> and as Mr. <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> was King of the Begging Crew, there was a grand Fe&s;tival held the next Day at their Hou&s;e of Ren|dezvous, where he re&s;igned his Throne to ano|ther,

allowing a <HI>Yearly Pen&s;ion</HI> to &s;upport the Dignity of their Society, which was kept in more exact Order and &s;trict Decorum than &s;ome Con&s;ti|tutions which might fare much better if they were governed by their Example.</P>
<P><HI>The Wedding was kept at home with great Splen|dor, where was pre&s;ent a young Lady of ten Thou|&s;and Pound Fortune, who changed Hearts at fir&s;t Sight with Mr.</HI> El&s;tone, <HI>but he not having it in his Power to addre&s;s the young Lady for want of an equi|valent Stipend, he heartily &s;igh'd for her, till his Brother-in-Law perceiving him grow melancholy, en|quiring into the Cau&s;e, &s;oon made up the Match to the un&s;peakable Satisfaction of both Parties.</HI></P>
<P>As Providence had been careful in rewarding the&s;e injured Innocents, &s;o was it no le&s;s concern|ed in puni&s;hing the Guilty, as will appear by the powerful End of Mr. <HI>Anthony,</HI> who was in a Vi&s;it to Mr. <HI>Hume,</HI> attack'd on the Road by a party of <HI>Highwaymen,</HI> whom he endeavoured to re&s;t, but they re&s;olvidg on their Booty, &s;hot at him, which not proving effectual, they drew their Hangers and &s;tabbed him in different Parts of his <HI>Body,</HI> and left him weltering in his Blood upon the Road, where he &s;oon expired. The <HI>Highwaymen</HI> made off, and the Decea&s;ed was &s;oon own'd <HI>by</HI> &s;ome Pa&s;|&s;engers coming along the Road, the News was directly carried to town to his Father, who griev'd much for him, till in a few Days upon &s;earching in his Clo&s;et, he found &s;everal Papers under his
