<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE EARL TEMPLE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO dedicate a treati&s;e on tactics to a bi&s;hop, or a di&s;cour&s;e on religion to a general, would be a great impropriety; but I can by no means think it one, to in&s;cribe the Memoirs of Mr. Churchill to the earl Temple.</P>
<P>Indeed, my lord, I know not to whom I could, with greater pro|priety,
<PB REF="4">
addre&s;s the following &s;heets, than to your lord&s;hip. Your lord|&s;hip, or I greatly mi&s;take, had a great re&s;pect for Mr. Churchill; ad|mired his abilities, and loved his integrity.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not pretend, in this Dedi|cation, to draw the character of lord Temple, however prevalent the practice is with dedicators with re&s;pect to their patrons. I &s;hall not entreat lord Temple to patroni&s;e my work: it mu&s;t patroni&s;e it&s;elf. If it be well written, it will be well received; if a mere un&s;ucce&s;s|ful effort to draw a ju&s;t portrait of my friend, even my lord Temple's patronage, great as it is, will be in|&s;ufficient to &s;creen it from its de|&s;erved cen&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB REF="5">
Yet, my lord, though I decline the arduous, plea&s;ing work, of draw|ing your lord&s;hip's character; give me leave to admire that un&s;haken &s;pirit of independence, that glori|ous greatne&s;s of &s;oul, which &s;hines through every action of your lord|&s;hip's life, adds a lu&s;tre to your high rank, and ennobles your vir|tues! Not to mention one's &s;en|&s;ibility of it, would be criminal; not to own it, would be ingrati|tude.</P>
<P>England owes much to your lord&s;hip. The cau&s;e, the great and glorious cau&s;e of liberty, has, in your lord&s;hip, found a pow|erful patron, and an able advo|cate.</P>
<P><PB REF="6">
It is a fortunate circum&s;tance, when a &s;tate&s;man has a &s;trength of genius, and a high reach of thought; but it is &s;till more &s;o, when that reach of thought, and &s;trength of genius, is accompanied with invin|cible integrity, and a Temple's vir|tues.</P>
<P>Patrioti&s;m, like wit, is much talked of; claimed by many, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by few. To form a patriot, great abilities alone will not &s;uc|ceed. There mu&s;t be al&s;o a true <HI>amor patriae;</HI> a generous di&s;regard of private intere&s;t, if &s;et in compe|tition with the public good; and a Temple's, and a Pitt's unconquer|ed freedom of &s;oul, incorruptible probity of mind.</P>
<P><PB REF="7">
Your lord&s;hip's known zeal for the honour of religion mu&s;t not pa&s;s unnoticed. The weakening of mo|ral obligations is of the utmo&s;t dan|ger to a &s;tate. While religion maintains its influence, the intere&s;ts of &s;ociety are upheld: when that great cement of &s;ociety is weak|ened, anarchy and confu&s;ion &s;oon &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>A friend to religion is a friend to his country. It is a &s;ingular hap|pine&s;s that, in the&s;e degenerate days, when infidelity pa&s;&s;es for judgment, and ob&s;cenity for wit, genuine and true piety, the fair child of religion, points out a Tem|ple, as her advocate, and as her friend.</P>
<P><PB REF="8">
As a lover of liberty, in the real &s;en&s;e of the word, your lord&s;hip &s;tands eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed.&mdash;The enormous faith of many made for one has been long and ju&s;tly ex|ploded; yet, notwith&s;tanding the glaring ab&s;urdity of &s;uch a &s;oul-en|&s;laving tenet, fools and knaves have not been wanting, in the&s;e times, to preach up this doctrine, and re|commend this ab&s;urdity; the great|e&s;t affront &s;ure that ever was offered to the common-&s;en&s;e of mankind!</P>
<P>A con&s;titutional defender of the laws has always appeared in the per&s;on of the earl Temple. The prerogatives of the &s;overeign, and the freedom of the &s;ubjects, are not &s;o incompatible as &s;ome dreamers imagine. The greate&s;t &s;trength a
<PB REF="9">
prince can po&s;&s;e&s;s, the mo&s;t home|felt ble&s;&s;ing he can po&s;&s;ibly know, is the love of his people. This doctrine the earl Temple has ever been ready to inculcate; has always been &s;trenuous to defend.</P>
<P>Of all the virtues that do honour to mankind, I know of none more amiable, or more beneficial, than a generous, di&s;intere&s;ted friend&s;hip, built on the firm ba&s;is of honour and judgment. None but the good can po&s;&s;e&s;s this virtue. A titled wretch, or wealthy mi&s;creant, is a &s;tranger to tho&s;e delicate &s;en&s;ations that &s;pring from &s;o pure a &s;ource. That my lord Temple may be pointed out as an eminent example of generous and di&s;intere&s;ted friend|&s;hip,
<PB REF="10">
every one knows, and every one confe&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Example is always more power|ful than precept. To look up, therefore, to my lord Temple, as a &s;tate&s;man, a patriot, and a friend, will have greater effect than the de&s;cription of many &s;tate&s;men, pa|triots, and friends, in the writings of the learned world.</P>
<P>But whil&s;t your lord&s;hip &s;tands &s;o eminently con&s;picuous for your abi|lities and integrity in public life, your amiable deportment in private life mu&s;t not be forgot. Ea&s;y of acce&s;s, your lord&s;hip is enabled to form a true e&s;timate of things. Chearful, free, and affable, your
<PB REF="11">
lord&s;hip gives plea&s;ure wherever you come; and when you retire from &s;ocial conver&s;e with your friends, they meet a lo&s;s not ea&s;ily to be repaired but by your lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>My lord! I addre&s;s not the &s;tate&s;|man; I addre&s;s not the nobleman; I addre&s;s not the man of fortune. I addre&s;s the man.</P>
<P>If, as Mr. Pope &s;ays, an hone&s;t man is the noble&s;t work of the Al|mighty; your lord&s;hip has abun|dant rea&s;on to ble&s;s the Father of all good gifts, for his enduing you with &s;uch amiable qualities, as ren|der you the delight of mankind, and an ornament to your country. Your gardens at Stow, and the &s;culptures of your temple, &s;hall
<PB REF="12">
peri&s;h, when your virtues &s;hall be read and admired by future ages, in the productions of the hi&s;torian, or the efforts of the mu&s;e.</P>
<P>Yet, my lord, (I &s;peak it with Engli&s;h &s;incerity, and Engli&s;h li|berty!) you are a man; and, as &s;uch, have faults: but, I believe, it would puzzle the mo&s;t di&s;cern|ing to point them out. Indeed, it is no &s;mall proof of your lord&s;hip's wi&s;dom, that, while every one ad|mires your virtues, you have &s;o ef|fectually concealed your foibles, which, &s;urely, as a man, you mu&s;t have, that we cannot &s;o much as gue&s;s at them; for eagle-eyed &s;can|dal it&s;elf has never thrown the lea&s;t innuendo, or &s;malle&s;t in&s;inuation, again&s;t your character.</P>
<P><PB REF="13">
For me, my lord, I am thrown at too great a di&s;tance from your lord&s;hip, to pretend to draw your portrait with a ma&s;terly hand. But, however deficient I may be in point of drapery, the re&s;emblance is &s;trik|ing; for I appeal to your lord|&s;hip's enemies, if enemies you have, whether I have drawn one feature your lord&s;hip does not po&s;&s;e&s;s, or attributed one excellence your lord|&s;hip is not endued with!</P>
<P>My lord, I &s;eek no applau&s;e, and claim no honour, from the follow|ing &s;heets. My intention has been, to give a faithful hi&s;tory, as nearly as I could, of our late patriot bard: to re&s;cue his character from the cen&s;ures of the malevolent; and, &s;till more cruel fate! from the in|di&s;criminate
<PB REF="14">
and indi&s;creet applau&s;es of his friends.</P>
<P>That your lord&s;hip may long re|main with us, as the firm friend of liberty, and your country; and, when called from this terre&s;trial world, that you may enjoy a con|&s;picuous place in the man&s;ions of eternal bli&s;s, is the &s;incere wi&s;h, and fervent prayer, of,</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A Sketch of Mr. Churchill's character.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THOSE &s;ons of genius and judgment who have made them&s;elves remarkable, by the exertion of their abilities, when departed from this &s;ublunary world
<PB N="26" REF="16">
&s;eem to claim the remembrance of their &s;urvivors as a debt; and gra|titude &s;ugge&s;ts to us, it would be inhuman, as well as impolitic, to con&s;ign their memories to oblivion, at the &s;ame time that we commit their clay to the grave.</P>
<P>Anecdotes concerning the good and great throw a light on many pa&s;&s;ages in their writings, which without them would be ob&s;cure. Nay, we cannot ta&s;te the works of a fine genius &s;o thoroughly, as when acquainted with his life's hi&s;tory. If we are informed of his family, his education, connections, and con|duct in private life, we have a kind of comment on his writings by us, which elucidates his &s;entiments, and explains ambiguities.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="17">
On the&s;e accounts, mankind pe|ru&s;e with a peculiar plea&s;ure, any little informations, concerning the lives and manners of tho&s;e, who have &s;oared above the common herd of mortals, by the di&s;play of any extraordinary acqui&s;itions they have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of.</P>
<P>While &s;ome con&s;ider the cha|racter of a philo&s;opher or a bard, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, approaching to that of a demi-god; others look on it in the mo&s;t contemptible light imaginable. The former are chiefly compo&s;ed of low, illiterate people, or pretended &s;cholars; the latter, of &s;ub&s;tantial or ignorant trade&s;|men, who&s;e whole abilities con&s;i&s;t in a plodding, dull, hou&s;ehold un|der&s;tanding, capable of the com|mon
<PB N="28" REF="18">
rules of arithmetic, and cal|culated for the meridian of a gro|cer's, or an oilman's &s;hop.</P>
<P>To both the&s;e mi&s;taken kind of beings, the following work will afford little entertainment. Mr. Churchill, in his private conduct, was not unlike any other gentle|man; and, therefore, tho&s;e who expect marvellous adventures, and uncommon &s;cenes, to be here re|lated, or the dirty and pitiful tricks of a poor wit to gain a precarious livelihood, will be equally di&s;ap|pointed.</P>
<P>Mr. Churchill was a man&mdash;a com|pounded being of fle&s;h and &s;pirit&mdash;neither a deity, nor a devil; as hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> friends and foes &s;eem to in&s;inuate&punc;
<PB N="29" REF="19">
He had many virtues; and &s;ome vices. Many excellent faculties, and extraordinary accompli&s;hments; and &s;ome defects. Some &s;ingulari|ties; but an amazing number of winning methods, the fair fruits, the pure offspring of a good heart, of conciliating the e&s;teem of all his friends and acquaintances.</P>
<P>Di&s;tre&s;s never &s;ued to him in vain. A philanthropy that knew no bounds, taught him to &s;ympa|thize at others woes, and melt at others &s;orrows. His pur&s;e was ever open to the poor and indigent; his advice ever ready to the ignorant and dubious.</P>
<P>Pride and revenge were &s;trangers to him. His good-&s;en&s;e pre&s;erved
<PB N="30" REF="20">
him from the fir&s;t; and a thorough conviction of the truth and excel|lency of the chri&s;tian religion, and a fortitude of &s;oul which no dangers could daunt, &s;ecured him from the la&s;t.</P>
<P>If injured by an inveterate foe, his re&s;entment was ever proporti|oned to the offence; but if time, with &s;tealing pace, crept on, it era&s;ed all remembrance of it from his memory; and the lea&s;t conce&s;|&s;ion made by the offender, made Churchill his firm friend.</P>
<P>Brave and open-hearted, no ma|lice could ever lurk in his &s;oul,&mdash;Of exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ations, the &s;mall|e&s;t injury was felt; but felt, to be either pardoned, or de&s;pi&s;ed; ex|cept
<PB N="31" REF="21">
when prudential caution made it nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;ent it: then due cha&s;ti&s;ement was inflicted, and the offender him&s;elf forced, on the re|turn of rea&s;on, to own the ju&s;tice of the hand that &s;mote him.</P>
<P>A tiny witling,&mdash;the mo&s;t con|temptible of all contemptible wri|ters&mdash;the putter-together of dull e&s;&s;ays for a dull news-paper&mdash;on his publication of his Ro&s;ciad, thought proper to a&s;per&s;e his cha|racter, and depreciate his work.&mdash;Churchill was &s;hewn the paper, and told the name of its author. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You ought to re&s;ent this unprovoked attack, and this fal&s;e piece of critici&s;m,"</Q> cries the friend.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Not at all," an&s;wers the bard; "that is the very rea&s;on it is be|neath
<PB N="32" REF="22">
neath my notice: I look on this wretch, as the generous hor&s;e &s;urveys the yelping cur at his heels, with cold di&s;dain, and &s;i|lent contempt."</Q></P>
<P>Another time, <HI>tho&s;e veterans that know an author by his &s;tile,</HI> under|took to prove he was a fellow of no mark, or livelihood, as Shake&s;pear expre&s;&s;es it, and that his works were unworthy the public notice. Churchill being &s;hewn the elabo|rate production of the&s;e directors of the public ta&s;te, and reque&s;ted to an&s;wer it, ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that if flies buzz about one, it were ri|diculous to regard them; but if they attempted to &s;ting, it were fit they &s;hould be cru&s;hed."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="23">
Superior to corruption, repeated offers, that would have &s;taggered the patrioti&s;m, and &s;apped the very foundations, of m-n-&s;t-r--l inte|grity, were rejected with di&s;dain. He &s;corned to pro&s;titute his pen for a place or pen&s;ion; and had rather eat a beef-&s;teak, and drink a tankard of porter, with an ho|ne&s;t artizan, than fea&s;t on orto|lans, or veni&s;on, and drink claret and burgundy, with an ignoble no|bleman. When his name was at the highe&s;t, and he was dre&s;&s;ed like an amba&s;&s;ador, he would &s;hake hands with, and a&s;&s;i&s;t, a friend in di&s;tre&s;s with a thread-bare coat; and de&s;pi&s;e, from his very &s;oul, the &s;tar and gartered villain flaunting in embroidery.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="24">
He was &s;o thoroughly attached to the intere&s;t of Old-England, that he could not, without the utmo&s;t indignation, &s;ee her con&s;titution broke by rank empirics, her very vitals decayed, and her whole frame brought to &s;uch a con&s;umptive, hec|tic &s;tate, as threatened a &s;peedy di&s;|&s;olution.</P>
<P>What could be done by a private man, to prevent &s;o calamitous, &s;o fatal a cata&s;trophe, was done by him. His pen was employed in the cau&s;e of honour, in the cau&s;e of freedom, in the cau&s;e of Britain. His mu&s;e, of true cele&s;tial de&s;cent, engaged in the generous cau&s;e. She exhorted Britons to act for the in|tere&s;t of Britain; to &s;purn the venal &s;ee; to di&s;dain the galling chain,
<PB N="35" REF="25">
though ca&s;ed with gold; to deliver down the generous plan of power our ance&s;tors had tran&s;mitted to us, at the expence of their blood and trea&s;ure, inviolate to po&s;terity; and to take all con&s;titutional methods to prevent iniquitous, ruinous, and de|&s;tructive, <HI>Scottified</HI> mea&s;ures from taking place.</P>
<P>For this he was blamed by the fool, and a&s;per&s;ed by the knave; traduced by &s;ycophants, and whi&s;|pered again&s;t by cowards: but, &s;o that his country could be in the lea&s;t benefited by his patriotic endea|vours, he regarded his foes like &s;o many &s;erpents, who would hi&s;s at the traveller, but &s;kulk away at the in&s;tant he was preparing to cha&s;tize them.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="26">
His &s;incerity was ever con&s;picu|ous, unque&s;tioned, and exemplary. Aver&s;e to flattery, he di&s;dained re|ceiving it him&s;elf, or to be&s;tow it on others. He ju&s;tly con&s;idered, the u&s;e of &s;peech is to deliver our &s;entiments; and he thought, that the man who is mean enough to &s;peak what he does not think, mu&s;t be both a coward and a &s;lave.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this opinion, he was as free, as cheerful, and as ea&s;y, in the &s;ociety of a lord as a trade&s;man; and was equally com|municative of his &s;entiments to the learned, as to the illiterate. For, as he was wholly exempt from &s;elf|conceit, and abhorred adulation; &s;o was he con&s;cious of &s;peaking the dictates of his heart; and ju&s;tly
<PB N="37" REF="27">
con&s;idered, that every individual that compo&s;es a company, has an undoubted right of delivering his &s;entiments freely to that company: and, though he might &s;ometimes be un&s;ucce&s;sful in his endeavours to in&s;truct, he was never &s;o in his at|tempt to plea&s;e and entertain.</P>
<P>A pitiful ambition of di&s;playing &s;uperior knowledge in particular arts and &s;ciences, that have been canva&s;&s;ed in company, is very com|mon, and is very ridiculous. This fault Churchill was never guilty of; and, tho' his erudition and know|ledge were &s;uperior to mo&s;t people's, and might have ju&s;tified him in en|forcing his &s;entiments with a pro|per warmth, and to take up a longer time than per&s;ons of inferior
<PB N="38" REF="28">
abilities could arrogate, he ever de|livered his opinion in a decent man|ner, and was as patient an auditor, as he was a &s;kilful orator.</P>
<P>Chearfulne&s;s is one of the mo&s;t amiable accompli&s;hments in a com|panion; and, if we may believe Mr. Addi&s;on, one of the peculiar cha|racteri&s;tics of a good Chri&s;tian. This accompli&s;hment, Churchill po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in a very eminent degree; for, being of a brave and intrepid di&s;po&s;ition, an hone&s;t man, and a good Chri&s;tian, di&s;appointments lo&s;t their force, and could not rob him of his wonted vigour and &s;erenity of mind.</P>
<P>There is a wide difference be|tween intemperate mirth and a
<PB N="39" REF="29">
chearful temper. The former our bard ever avoided; the latter he al|ways po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. A de&s;pondency of mind &s;eldom, indeed, attends a well|cultivated judgment and a noble &s;oul; and, perhaps, no per&s;on was ever more free from it than Mr. Churchill.</P>
<P>He was al&s;o a firm friend, and never made any profe&s;&s;ions of e&s;teem he did not really bear a per|&s;on. Far from con&s;idering &s;uch profe&s;&s;ions as mere words of cour&s;e, he religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved the promi&s;es he made; and punctually adhered to the friend&s;hips and connections he formed with various per&s;ons.</P>
<P>But a perfect character, as a great wit has ob&s;erved, is a faultle&s;s mon|&s;ter,
<PB N="40" REF="30">
a creature of the brain only, that never exi&s;ted in human-nature. Churchill is an eminent proof of the ju&s;tne&s;s of this ob&s;ervation. He had his faults; but they were &s;uch as were nearly allied to, and grew out of his exce&s;s of virtues. As every virtue is nearly connected with &s;ome vice, &s;o every vice borders on, and is not far remote from, its op|po&s;ite virtue. Churchill's exce&s;s of genero&s;ity, and contempt of &s;or|did lucre, led him to the oppo&s;ite extreme, and bordered on extrava|gance. His regard for his friends induced him to di&s;regard the nar|row limits of regularity and tem|perance, to indulge too frequently in riot and keeping ill hours: and his violent and true love for his country, and hatred of villainy,
<PB N="41" REF="31">
however dignified or di&s;tingui&s;hed, hurried him to &s;ome exce&s;&s;es, and carried him to &s;ome lengths in his writings, that are not, perhaps, &s;trictly ju&s;tifiable by the laws of his country, or con&s;i&s;tent with the rules of decorum or good-breeding.</P>
<P>To &s;um up his character, there|fore, conci&s;ely and candidly, we deliver it as our opinion, that his virtues, compared with his faults, are as mountains compared with mole-hills. As a man of genius and a poet, he &s;tands one of the fir&s;t in rank; as a patriot, his integrity re|mains unimpeached; as a valuable member of &s;ociety, he is de&s;ervedly e&s;teemed; and, as a firm friend, and a chearful companion, the tears that are &s;hed over his urn are ample
<PB N="42" REF="32">
proofs. Po&s;terity, therefore, &s;hall revere and embalm our poet's me|mory, when the malignant cen&s;ures of envious &s;narlers, who now at|tempt to pluck the well-earned wreath of merit from his laurelled brows, and defame his character with all the rage of petulant malice, &s;hall be forgotten; and when them|&s;elves &s;hall be turned to clay, and no traces of their having exi&s;ted re|main.</P>

on, the writings he has publi&s;hed: and it is not doubted, but, if we perform this work properly, it will be thought we &s;hall have matter &s;uf|ficient for one volume, without inter&s;per&s;ing it with particulars of people, and remarks on books, fo|reign to our purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus much by way of proemi|um; proceed we now to our hi&s;|tory.</P>
<P>Mr. Charles Churchill was born near We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey, in the hou&s;e where Mrs. Churchill, our poet's mother, now lives. His fa|ther was the reverend Mr. Charles Churchill, curate and lecturer of St. John's, in We&s;tmin&s;ter; a man de&s;ervedly e&s;teemed for the integrity
<PB N="46" REF="36">
of his heart, and the qualifications he was endued with.</P>
<P>Mr. Churchill had but little for|tune of his own, and but few ex|pectations from his relations, tho' de&s;cended from an antient and ho|nourable family.</P>
<P>At the accu&s;tomary age, Mr. Charles Churchill, our poet, was &s;ent to a reading-&s;chool, where he behaved in much the &s;ame manner as other children of his years gene|rally do; di&s;playing no characte|ri&s;tical marks of genius &s;uperior to his fellows, or acting different in any re&s;pect from them.</P>
<P>At the age of &s;ix, however, when &s;ome little dawnings of rea&s;on begin
<PB N="47" REF="37">
to appear, and the natural di&s;po&s;i|tion of a boy reveals it&s;elf, the temper of young Churchill might be &s;een. It was plainly apparent that his &s;en&s;ibility was very quick; his fortitude of mind very great; his genero&s;ity con&s;picuous; and his candor quite amiable.</P>
<P>A &s;triking in&s;tance of the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion I beg leave to relate, from the authority of his father; who, among other little anecdotes concerning his &s;on, told me the fol|lowing:</P>
<P>One of his &s;chool-fellows, an arch, unlucky boy, &s;omewhat older than our hero, in diverting him&s;elf with throwing of &s;tones, in con|junction with young Churchill, had
<PB N="48" REF="38">
the misfortune to break a pane of gla&s;s of a neighbour's window.</P>
<P>Alarmed at the rattling of the gla&s;s, and &s;till more &s;o with the fear of puni&s;hment, the young rogue fled from the &s;cene of action with all the precipitation his heels could fur|ni&s;h, and his companion followed him.</P>
<P>An enquiry was, however, &s;oon made into the affair; and the of|fender threatened with &s;evere cha&s;|ti&s;ement unle&s;s he confe&s;&s;ed the truth. Churchill's companion &s;tiffly denied his being the aggre&s;&s;or, and charged it on him. He was, ac|cordingly, called to an account; in|formed, that his play-fellow had po&s;itively declared he had broken
<PB N="49" REF="39">
the pane of gla&s;s, and required to make an ample confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Our young hero was &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed at his friend's ba&s;ene&s;s and fal&s;hood, that, in&s;tead of vindicating his in|nocence, and recriminating on his accu&s;er, he bur&s;t into tears. The tears were con&s;trued by his &s;chool-ma&s;ter as a &s;ign of guilt, and he was &s;everely whipped. After which, notice was &s;ent to Mr. Churchill, who immediately paid for the da|mage &s;u&s;tained by the breaking of the pane.</P>
<P>This tran&s;action happened in the &s;chool-yard, and our hero's compa|nion hugged him&s;elf at the &s;ucce&s;s of his ingenuity, in e&s;caping the puni&s;hment he feared, and gloried in the betraying of his friend.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="40">
After the &s;chool-hours were over, as the children were returning to their re&s;pective homes, young Churchill, in a firm voice, charged his companion with being a liar, to a&s;&s;ert &s;o manife&s;t a fal&s;ity as to ac|cu&s;e him of breaking the gla&s;s; and a coward, for not daring to brave the puni&s;hment due for his crime; and withall told him, that, &s;ince he had acted &s;o unworthily, he would beat him, and never a&s;&s;oci|ate with him afterwards.</P>
<P>The other, confiding in his &s;u|perior &s;trength, being a &s;turdy boy, and at lea&s;t a year older than our hero, di&s;regarded his threats, and offered to fight him. The propo|&s;al Churchill accepted with joy, and they both &s;tripped. In three
<PB N="51" REF="41">
minutes, our hero had entirely vanqui&s;hed his antagoni&s;t, had made his no&s;e bleed, given him two black eyes, and throwing him again&s;t a flint-&s;tone, he was &s;o much &s;tunned that he lay quite &s;en&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>Our hero having now taken &s;a|tisfaction for the treachery &s;hewn him, his honour being &s;atisfied, clemency &s;ucceeded. He rai&s;ed up his friend, who &s;oon coming to him&s;elf, and declaring he would fight no more, Churchill told him, he now forgave him: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But, not|with&s;tanding that," continued he, "I will never be intimate with &s;uch a fal&s;e friend again, unle&s;s you a&s;k my pardon, and confe&s;s the truth, that you broke the win|dow."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="42">
The little fellow did both. Our hero was applauded by every one for his courage and genero&s;ity; his friend receiving &s;o effectual a check for his perfidiou&s;ne&s;s in &s;uch early years, altered his conduct; and Churchill and he were good friends ever after.</P>
<P>Another time, fearing that his antagoni&s;t would receive puni&s;h|ment for &s;ome fault he had commit|ted, he advi&s;ed him to hide the &s;chool-ma&s;ter's birchen rod. He accordingly did &s;o: the rod was mi&s;&s;ed; and, to effect a di&s;covery of the offender, all the boys were examined; and all denied their knowing any thing of the matter. The &s;chool-ma&s;ter vowed, that they &s;hould all be whipped, one after
<PB N="53" REF="43">
another, till the offender confe&s;&s;ed his guilt; and in&s;tantly ordered, that our young hero's late antagoni&s;t &s;hould be the fir&s;t. Churchill, &s;ee|ing him already hor&s;ed, and ready to receive the la&s;hes, told the ma&s;ter, if he would not whip Billy N---, he would inform him which boy had hid the rod. The ma&s;ter promi&s;ed he would not; Billy was &s;et down; and, in a &s;tern voice, the ma&s;ter a&s;ked our hero, who the offender was; and, at the &s;ame time, threatened he would &s;e|verely cha&s;ti&s;e him; or, in his own words, whip him within an inch of his life.</P>
<P>All the boys now &s;tood agha&s;t, and dreaded the menaced puni&s;h|ment. Even con&s;cious innocence
<PB N="54" REF="44">
could not &s;ecure them from fear; and their little limbs &s;eemed robbed of their wonted functions, and trembled; while the pallid hue that over&s;pread their &s;everal faces, de|clared, that each was fearful le&s;t him&s;elf &s;hould be charged with the offence.</P>
<P>Our hero only was unmoved. Surveying his ma&s;ter with an at|tentive, but re&s;pectful look; "Sir," &s;aid he, with a firm voice, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I only am guilty: I only de&s;erve to &s;uf|fer.&mdash;All my &s;choolfellows are entirely innocent, and, therefore, unde&s;erving your re&s;entment. On me inflict your &s;courge: I de&s;erve it; and am prepared to &s;uffer."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="45">
The unrelenting, the unfeeling brute, in&s;en&s;ible to the courage and candor of the youthful hero, or|dered him to be hor&s;ed, pulled down his breeches, and the uplifted rod threatened his poor po&s;teriors, when a voice cried out, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Churchill is not guilty, but I am!"</Q></P>
<P>This was fre&s;h matter of &s;urpri&s;e to the a&s;toni&s;hed pedagogue. He had no &s;ort of conception that any boy &s;hould voluntarily offer to &s;uf|fer for his friend, and determined on whipping both, to di&s;cover the real truth.</P>
<P>He now examined both the par|ties between whom this generous conte&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; and neither could be induced, from the fear of any
<PB N="56" REF="46">
puni&s;hment, to retract from their re&s;olution of &s;uffering for each other.&mdash;In &s;hort, the illiterate wretch, unable to feel the beauty and heroi&s;m of their conduct, whipped both in the &s;evere&s;t man|ner.</P>
<P>The con&s;equence was, old Mr. Churchill hearing of the affair, ex|amined into the true &s;tate of it, and learnt the real truth. He admired his &s;on for his good-nature in con|cealing the fault of his friend, and for his intrepidity in bearing the puni&s;hment due to him alone; and he e&s;teemed young Billy N------, his &s;on's late antagoni&s;t, in per&s;i&s;t|ing to own that he only hid the rod. A week after both of them were
<PB N="57" REF="47">
taken from that &s;chool, and &s;ent to another, where a more &s;kilful &s;choolma&s;ter, and worthier man pre&s;ided; and the example of the parents of the&s;e young friends was followed by many others &s;oon after.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Our hero is taken from the reading|&s;chool, and &s;ent to that of We&s;t|min&s;ter&mdash;Makes at fir&s;t but a very &s;low progre&s;s&mdash;An anecdote greatly to his honour, and declarative of his di&s;po&s;ition, and turn of mind&mdash;He alters his conduct, and applies to his learning with the greate&s;t a&s;&s;iduity&mdash;Some remarks on the ab&s;urdity generally practi&s;ed by &s;choolma&s;ters in their tuition of youth&mdash;Their excu&s;e in their fa|vour an&s;wered&mdash;Churchill and his father &s;et out for Oxford, that the former might be placed there&mdash;He is examined, and rejected&mdash;They re|turn to London.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT was not many years after this tran&s;action, that young Churchill was &s;ent to We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;chool, to
<PB N="59" REF="49">
be educated in the higher branches of learning.</P>
<P>For the fir&s;t two or three years he continued here, he did not di&s;|play any extraordinary capacity, or &s;hew any marks of that genius he afterwards exhibited. Nay, he was not unfrequently incapable of mak|ing his exerci&s;e, and remanded back to render it more perfect.</P>
<P>His capacity, however, was infi|nitely &s;uperior to his a&s;&s;iduity. He was idle, fond of play, aver&s;e to &s;tudy, and te&s;tified the utmo&s;t re|luctance in conforming to the tram|mels of a &s;chool education.</P>
<P>This evidently appears from his being able to go through all his ex|erci&s;es
<PB N="60" REF="50">
whenever he thought proper to apply to them with half the at|tention that the generality of boys do: and the following true anecdote of him is a farther proof of the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>Having through idlene&s;s, or inat|tention, neglected one day to make his exerci&s;e, his ma&s;ter thought proper to cha&s;ti&s;e him very &s;everely, and at the &s;ame time reproached him for his &s;tupidity; telling him he was the mo&s;t idle and ignorant boy in the &s;chool; that did he &s;till per&s;i&s;t in his neglecting to furni&s;h his mind with cla&s;&s;ic learning, he would never be able to make a figure in life, but be looked upon as a dull and illiterate blockhead: a character, he &s;aid, the mo&s;t odious that could
<PB N="61" REF="51">
be imagined, and which would &s;ub|ject him to the contempt of the wi&s;e and learned, and render him fit company only for people like him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The remon&s;trance had its due effect. Churchill ruminated in his mind on what his ma&s;ter had &s;aid, and he found he had &s;poke the truth. He determined, therefore, he &s;hould no longer have cau&s;e to complain of him; for he would be as a&s;&s;iduous and indu&s;trious, as he had before been indolent and lazy.</P>
<P>From this time his improvement in literature was rapid, was a&s;toni&s;h|ing. He learnt with ea&s;e what co&s;t others the greate&s;t pains; and he apprehended, as by intuition, the
<PB N="62" REF="52">
true meaning of &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages that occurred to him, which his com|panions had not the lea&s;t idea of.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee that what the fear of &s;tripes could not effect, the fear of &s;hame &s;oon produced; and from henceforwards he brought his ex|erci&s;es fini&s;hed in &s;uch a manner, that he received the public thanks of all his ma&s;ters; and was pointed out as an example that the other boys ought to copy.</P>
<P>The&s;e encomiums were not given in vain. They filled our hero with the mo&s;t agreeable &s;en&s;ations, and excited in him greater de&s;ires of approaching &s;till nearer to perfec|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="53">
Suffer me here to make a remark: a remark growing out of, and con|nected with my &s;ubject, and as &s;uch, not to be looked on as a di|gre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Our hero's ma&s;ter acted ex|tremely jndicious in his conduct. He well knew Churchill dreaded not cha&s;ti&s;ement: he knew he dreaded &s;hame. However, that his admonition might have greater ef|fect, it was preceded by &s;ome&s;tripes; and then, in the pre&s;ence of all the &s;cholars, he pointed him out as the mo&s;t indolent, &s;tupid boy in the whole &s;chool.</P>
<P>It is not a little &s;trange, that we &s;o &s;eldom &s;ee the conduct of this ma&s;ter imitated. Our &s;choolma&s;ters,
<PB N="64" REF="54">
in general, con&s;ult not the different di&s;po&s;itions of different lads; they con&s;ult not the wide difference there is, in point of genius, between one boy and another: they take the &s;ame methods of in&s;truction with, they teach the &s;ame branches of learning to, all.</P>
<P>Is not &s;uch a conduct manife&s;tly wrong? is it not incongruous to common rea&s;on, and irreconcileable to the common nature of things? do people of any profe&s;&s;ions, men of any trades, act &s;o ab&s;urdly, in this re&s;pect, as &s;choolma&s;ter's; who &s;hould, one would imagine, be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of good-&s;en&s;e and di&s;cern|ment, &s;omewhat &s;uperior to the bulk of mankind?</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="55">
Does an ignorant farmer act &s;o ignorantly as a learned &s;chool|ma&s;ter? does he &s;ow his &s;eeds on lands not fit for them? or, does he not rather, con&s;ult the difference of &s;oils, and &s;ow his &s;eeds on tho&s;e lands that are mo&s;t peculiarly adapted to each?</P>
<P>So ought a &s;choolma&s;ter to do: the farmer's conduct ought he to copy. It is with the human mind as it is with land. Some minds re|quire little cultivation to what others do: they &s;pontaneou&s;ly bring forth much good fruit: while others pro|duce little but weeds and tares.&mdash;Yet are the&s;e la&s;t to be neglected becau&s;e they want in&s;truction mo&s;t? no; they are rather to be mended by a different kind of manure than
<PB N="66" REF="56">
what the others require. With dif|ferent &s;oils different methods are taken to purge and cultivate them; and &s;o mu&s;t it be with the human mind.</P>
<P>I know but of one rea&s;on that can be a&s;&s;igned for the ab&s;urdity of our &s;choolma&s;ters I have above pointed out. Indeed, it is a for|cible one in their favour; but it is no extenuation of the ab&s;urdity of parent's conduct.&mdash;The rea&s;on I mean is, that &s;o poor a pittance is given for the education of youth, that it lays the ma&s;ter under a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of taking more &s;cholars than he can po&s;&s;ibly in&s;truct, to do all of them ju&s;tice. However, though, to gain a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, he is obliged to have a multitude of
<PB N="67" REF="57">
pupils, one quarter of which would take up his whole time to in&s;truct properly; yet, did he but attend to the different capacities of his boys ever &s;o little, and had penetration and learning &s;ufficient for the ar|duous profe&s;&s;ion he had a&s;&s;umed, he might di&s;cern the various di&s;po|&s;itions and talents of various boys; and did he di&s;charge properly the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him, he would, in con&s;equence of his ob&s;ervations, lay his opinion before the youths parents; and if, after being in|formed of the turn and bent of their &s;ons genius, they &s;hould, never|thele&s;s, per&s;i&s;t in having them taught branches of literature their genius's were not turned for, and adapted to, tho&s;e parents only would be in fault.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="58">
Our hero having continued at &s;chool a &s;ufficient number of years, and being thoroughly conver&s;ant in &s;chola&s;tic education; his father re|&s;olved on &s;ending him to the uni|ver&s;ity of Oxford, where he him|&s;elf had been educated, to fini&s;h his &s;tudies.</P>
<P>Hiring a po&s;t-chai&s;e, and his &s;on and him&s;elf getting in it, they &s;et out for the univer&s;ity, and arrived there in about nine hours.</P>
<P>The literate or intelligent reader need not be told, that an examina|tion is always made of the per&s;on who offers him&s;elf to be admitted, with re&s;pect to his abilities in cla&s;|&s;ical learning. This examination our hero was now to go through;
<PB N="69" REF="59">
and, con&s;cious of his own abilities, he dreaded it not.</P>
<P>His father, indeed, had for &s;ome time before, in order to render him &s;till more a&s;&s;iduous at his exerci&s;es at We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;chool, &s;ought to impre&s;s an high idea of the great talents nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;tudent to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, to be admitted into the univer&s;ity; and of the profound erudition the examiner him&s;elf was ma&s;ter of; which, indeed, he &s;aid, was &s;ufficiently apparent from the difficult que&s;tions he propo&s;ed to the examinant.</P>
<P>When Churchill, after va&s;t &s;olem|nity, and an awful preparation, de|&s;igned to intimidate him, and lower his &s;en&s;e of his own qualifications,
<PB N="70" REF="60">
was led up to the examiner, who&s;e &s;olemn vi&s;age, rendered important by a bu&s;hy wig, be&s;poke credit from a &s;uperficial ob&s;erver for va&s;t wi&s;|dom; he began to think his father's de&s;cription of the examiner was a ju&s;t one; and prepared to an&s;wer the extremely difficult que&s;tions he imagined would be propo&s;ed to him.</P>
<P>But in&s;tead of the&s;e difficulties, how amazed was he, on the open|ing of the examiner's mouth, to find the charm di&s;&s;olved! in&s;tead of being required to an&s;wer que&s;|tions of depth and &s;olidity, he had none propo&s;ed to him, but what were &s;o &s;uperficial, &s;o frivolous and trifling, that a boy of the third
<PB N="71" REF="61">
cla&s;s, might with ea&s;e have &s;olved them.</P>
<P>Our hero was &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed and &s;o irritated, at their thus treating him like an ideot, as he imagined it, that he could not but re&s;ent it. He accordingly &s;atiri&s;ed the per&s;on who&s;e office it was to examine him; to que&s;tion his abilities who was appointed to fathom his own; and to a&s;k &s;ome que&s;tions, which the examiner, whether from ignorance, or di&s;dain, I know not, did not think proper to an&s;wer.</P>
<P>The con&s;equence was, that our hero was rejected; and, probably, this circum&s;tance might have given occa&s;ion to the frequent invectives
<PB N="72" REF="62">
we find in his works again&s;t that mo&s;t re&s;pectable univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>Upon his returning from Oxford, he again applied to his &s;tudies at We&s;tmin&s;ter-&s;chool, and made &s;uch a progre&s;s as was really &s;urpri&s;ing; which afforded great &s;atisfaction to his father, and his friends.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Our hero falls in love with a very agreeable young lady&mdash;He pays his addre&s;&s;es to, and marries her&mdash;His father &s;peaks to him concerning his taking on him the &s;acred function&mdash;He is examined, and ordained by the bi&s;hop of London&mdash;Is promoted to a curacy in North-Wales, of almo&s;t thirty pounds a year&mdash;Mrs. Churchill and he &s;et out for, and arrive at their de&s;tined place of re&s;idence.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHILE our hero was thus laudably employed in the cultivation of his mind, his heart was mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly affected at the &s;ight of Mi&s;s ----------, and he
<PB N="74" REF="64">
longed for an opportunity of de|claring his exce&s;s of love.</P>
<P>He was then but &s;eventeen; was robu&s;t, comely, and well-propor|tioned: exerci&s;e had thrown crim|&s;on on his cheeks, and given a vi|gour to his limbs which effeminate beaux and &s;laves of indolence are entire &s;trangers to. While, fal&s;ly luxurious, the delicate and the de|bauched were impairing their con|&s;titutions, and enervating their minds, by di&s;&s;ipation and luxury, young Churchill was a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly em|ployed, during &s;chool-hours, to lay in a large &s;tock of cla&s;&s;ic lore; and afterwards, in engaging in manly, robu&s;t exerci&s;es, which, while they contributed to open his che&s;t, to brace his nerves, and enure him to
<PB N="75" REF="65">
brave the inclemencies of the wea|ther, or change of &s;ea&s;ons in this va|rying clime, not a little a&s;&s;i&s;ted in fortifying his mind; as it is well known, that, the &s;tronger and more robu&s;t a body is, the more likely is it to lodge a brave and noble &s;oul.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s ---------, the young lady our hero had &s;et his affections on, was neither a complete beauty or a wit; but &s;he was endued with &s;ome accompli&s;hments &s;uperior to both: accompli&s;hments that rendered her the envy of her own &s;ex and the ad|miration of ours.</P>
<P>She was judicious, di&s;creet, &s;in|cere, and affable; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of virtue without au&s;terity; gaiety, without levity; wit, without ill|nature;
<PB N="76" REF="66">
and prudence, without conceit. Her per&s;onal accompli&s;h|ments were al&s;o &s;ufficient to attract the attention of the mo&s;t indiffer|ent, and excite the warme&s;t de&s;ires in the colde&s;t brea&s;t; being well|&s;haped, agreeable, and di&s;playing a certain <HI>je ne &s;cais quoi</HI> in her whole appearance, that invites more pow|erfully than haughty beauty com|mands.</P>
<P>To this lady our hero contrived to get him&s;elf introduced, and paid his addre&s;&s;es to her with all the warmth that youthful ardor could in&s;pire.</P>
<P>The more he knew of the lady the better he loved her. If, on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;light and tran&s;ient view, he found
<PB N="77" REF="67">
his brea&s;t was touched, a thorough acquaintance, and a more clo&s;e in|timacy, affected his very &s;oul. Rea&s;on approved what pa&s;&s;ion ad|mired. To fix one's e&s;teem on a truly de&s;erving object, is, at once, a proof of a good head and a good heart.</P>
<P>This proof our poet gave. He perfectly idolized his charmer, and every opportunity he had of being with her alone, he &s;ought to evince the greatne&s;s of his pa&s;&s;ion, by pouring out the dictates of his &s;oul in the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive and undi&s;&s;em|bled terms love could &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>The artle&s;s, &s;incere pa&s;&s;ion our hero felt; the forcible, the winning expre&s;&s;ions he u&s;ed, in breathing
<PB N="78" REF="68">
out the &s;oft &s;entiments of his &s;oul, &s;oon excited a reciprocal love in his charmer. She confe&s;&s;ed his merit, &s;he &s;aw his accompli&s;hments, and &s;he gave him her heart.</P>
<P>Where a violent and a mutual flame warms two bo&s;oms, and the parties are both agreed, it is not long before the aid of Hymen is required to tie the connubial knot. So was it &s;oon by our hero and his charmer, and they were united in tho&s;e bands which nothing but death or divorce could loo&s;e.</P>
<P>They both now thought them|&s;elves &s;upremely happy. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of each other, they imagined them|&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every thing that could contribute to their felicity

On &s;uch examination he found, to his great joy, his &s;on had no &s;ort of objection to that cour&s;e of life.

Being ordained by the bi&s;hop, he &s;ought to gain &s;ome preferment in the church; and re&s;olved, that, &s;hould he be &s;o fortunate, he would di&s;charge the duties of his &s;acred function con&s;cientiou&s;ly and pro|perly.</P>
<P>It is well known, that, without intere&s;t, had a man all the genius, and all the wi&s;dom, and all the learning in the world, he would &s;tand but little chance of ri&s;ing in the church.&mdash;But is this a&s;toni&s;h|ing? No. It would be &s;o, indeed, were it otherwi&s;e.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>NO man ever di&s;charged the duties of his &s;tation with greater chearfulne&s;s and a&s;&s;iduity
<PB N="89" REF="79">
than Mr. Churchill did; no man was ever more loved and e&s;teemed by his pari&s;hioners than he was. They con&s;idered him in the mo&s;t re&s;pectable light imaginable; paid due attention to his precepts, and honoured him for his worth and genius.</P>
<P>He had not lived long in Wales before he became a very popular preacher, and was followed there as much as Romaine is here.</P>
<P>A preacher's popularity generally ari&s;es from three cau&s;es only. Either from his inculcating &s;ome &s;trange and paradoxical opinions; from his working on the pa&s;&s;ions of his au|ditors, by a vehement or per&s;ua&s;ive oratory; or from his delivering
<PB N="90" REF="80">
whol&s;ome and &s;ound di&s;cour&s;es, written in a per&s;picuous, ea&s;y, ele|gant &s;tyle.</P>
<P>Our poet's popularity aro&s;e from the la&s;t a&s;&s;igned cau&s;e. His &s;er|mons were full of the &s;ublime&s;t and mo&s;t important truths, conveyed in a plain but expre&s;&s;ive language; which, though intelligible to the pea&s;ant, was not unworthy the at|tention of a peer.</P>
<P>By &s;ublime and important truths, I mean not di&s;qui&s;itions on mere &s;peculative points, or pretended ex|planations of my&s;teries, but truths that come home to every one's brea&s;t, that influence the moral conduct of mankind; and that therefore, are of the utmo&s;t con&s;e+quence
<PB N="91" REF="81">
to every per&s;on's peace of mind here, and to his eternal hap|pine&s;s hereafter.</P>
<P>Such only were the &s;ubjects Mr. Churchill expatiated on: &s;uch &s;ub|jects only ought every country cler|gyman to treat on; or it is impo&s;|&s;ible for him to di&s;charge the duties of his function properly, or edify his flock.</P>
<P>A diction is not le&s;s to be regard|ed than a &s;ubject. If the plaine&s;t theme be treated on in a maje&s;tic, &s;welling &s;tyle, replete with tropes, metaphors, and allegories, a con|gregation may go home ju&s;t as wi&s;e as they came. They may, indeed, &s;tare at the preacher, and cry him up for a profound &s;cholar; but their
<PB N="92" REF="82">
admiration will be found to proceed from the &s;ame cau&s;e as that of Don Lewis's did, in the play of The Fop's Fortune; who honoured his nephew Carlos for his high-&s;ound|ing Greek, though he did not un|der&s;tand a &s;ingle &s;yllable of it.</P>
<P>Churchill differed &s;o widely from preachers of this &s;tamp, that he &s;ought to convince their rea&s;on, by appealing to their rea&s;on only, in a plain, ea&s;y, Addi&s;onian &s;tyle, if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf.</P>
<P>His good conduct, in this re|&s;pect, cannot be &s;ufficiently com|mended. It is no uncommon thing for a per&s;on of low ideas, little learning, and le&s;s genius, to write and talk in &s;uch a manner as is per|fectly
<PB N="93" REF="83">
adapted to the capacities of the vulgar. But for a great poet, who&s;e imagination teems with lofty images, and &s;welling figures, to ac|commodate him&s;elf to the concep|tions of the million, is at once &s;in|gular and amazing!</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of our poet's de|meaning him&s;elf &s;o prudently, he was univer&s;ally e&s;teemed; and, tho' that part of Wales he lived in was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">one of the mo&s;t agreeable, e&s;peci|ally in the winter &s;ea&s;on, when the raw bleak winds came whi&s;tling o'er the mountain tops, piercing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">he reddened cheek, yet he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ontent with his &s;ituation, and em|ployed him&s;elf in going through <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">he offices of his function with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">lea&s;ure; and, when lei&s;ure per|mitted,

climbing the mountains in &s;earch of game, hunting, cour&s;ing, &s;hooting, angling, or walking; taking a chearful gla&s;s with his friends, or peru&s;ing tho&s;e books his own library, or tho&s;e of the neigh|bouring gentry afforded.</P>
<P>But, though he lived in a coun|try where there was plenty of pro|vi&s;ions, which of cour&s;e rendered them cheap; and though he re|ceived &s;ometimes pre&s;ents from his pari&s;hioners; yet how can a man maintain him&s;elf and wife on the poor pittance of twenty-&s;even pounds a year, in the manner they had been u&s;ed to live?&mdash;It is im|po&s;&s;ible. Churchill found it &s;o and, therefore, to enlarge his &s;canty finances, after the money he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="95" REF="85">
brought with him from England was exhau&s;ted, he re&s;olved to enter into a branch of trade, which, he hoped, would enable him to live in the &s;ame manner he had hitherto done.</P>
<P>The reader will not ea&s;ily conjec|ture what trade it was our poet pitched upon; and he will not be a little &s;urpri&s;ed when told it was that of a cyder-dealer. He had a large cellar belonging to his hou&s;e, which he fitted up as genteelly as the place would admit of; laid in a good &s;tock of cyder; furni&s;hed him|&s;elf with mugs and gla&s;&s;es, pipes and tobacco; and hey! pre&s;to! my lads, behold all at once the par&s;on and poet turned publican!</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="86">
Indeed, reader, be not &s;urpri&s;ed, &s;uch metamorpho&s;es are not uncom|mon in Wales. Par&s;ons are there hor&s;e-jockeys, &s;hop-keepers, bak|ers, barbers, butchers, ale-&s;ellers, and pig-dealers.</P>
<P>You have read Jo&s;eph Andrews, I &s;uppo&s;e; if you have not, I would not give a farthing for you. You may there be acquainted with par|&s;on Trulliber, of pig-&s;elling me|mory. I knew the man well. He was a round, fat, &s;hort, &s;quab fel|low, that under&s;tood the nature of a pig as well as any man in Wales. He was educated at Je&s;us-College at Oxford, entered into holy or|ders there, and &s;old pigs and preach|ed the Go&s;pel at Llanridwhyd, in Wales.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="87">
Our poet being thus turned cy|der-merchant, bu&s;ine&s;s flowed in a|pace. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Par&s;on! bring me a mug of the right &s;ort,"</Q> cries one. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This is excellent &s;tuff, i'faith,"</Q> cries another. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I pray you now, Mr. John Jones, I pe&s;eech you, and intrete you, now to tell me, look you, if you do not think this cyder is better than Lewis Mor|gan ap Thomas's?"</Q> a&s;ked ano|ther. In &s;hort, they all agreed the par&s;on's cyder was excellent; and they &s;wore, By Cot, there faz not &s;uch another coot liquor in Wales, look you!</P>
<P>Churchill, in the mean time, pined in &s;ecret, at being obliged to de&s;cend &s;o low as to &s;ell cyder. But what could he do? His pride pre|vented
<PB N="98" REF="88">
him from begging; and a genero&s;ity that knew no bounds opened his pur&s;e-&s;trings whenever di&s;tre&s;s &s;ued to him.</P>
<P>He had now more &s;upplicants than before, and his doors were continually crowded with di&s;tre&s;&s;ed wretches, entreating a meal's &s;u&s;te|nance to &s;atiate their hunger, or a drop of cyder to allay their thir&s;t.</P>
<P>He was a man, though re&s;olute and bold as the mo&s;t bold and re&s;o|lute, yet ca&s;t in pity's &s;ofte&s;t mould. He has given his liquor and victuals to the hungry and thir&s;ty, though he had none for a &s;econd meal for his own family; and the tear of &s;orrow hath &s;tarted from his eye at the affliction of tho&s;e whom his li|beral hand was unable to relieve.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="89">
His money, in the mean time, wa&s;ted away; his creditors gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">w clamorous; and a goal, the conti|nual terror of indigent genius, threatened him.</P>
<P>In this exigency he was for&s;aken by every thing but his re&s;olution and pre&s;ence of mind. He con|&s;ulted with his wife on the &s;teps proper for him to take to retrieve his affairs; and &s;he advi&s;ed an ap|plication to his creditors through the mediation of &s;ome friend. He approved of her coun&s;el; put it in execution; but had the mortifica|tion to find they would come into no terms, but in&s;i&s;ted on an imme|diate payment of their &s;everal de|mands.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="90">
In this dilemma he came to a re&s;olution of quitting the country and returning to London. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why &s;hould I," &s;aid he to his wife one day, "by continuing here, brave the horrors of a goal, and run the hazard of &s;tarving? It is true, I could ea&s;ily &s;upport the utmo&s;t misfortunes my ill fortune could inflict on me; but the thought of what you mu&s;t feel, quite un|mans me, and melts me into ten|derne&s;s.&mdash;However, my dear, don't be afflicted; it is a peculiar mark of a great mind to tower above adver&s;ity.

<P>The&s;e and other expo&s;tulations tended to dry her tears, and re&s;tore her to her wonted &s;erenity of mind.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>OUR poet was not a little de|lighted to revi&s;it his native country, after &s;o long and tedious
<PB N="103" REF="93">
an ab&s;ence, and to &s;ee his relations and friends, e&s;pecially his brother John, who is now an apothecary and druggi&s;t, in Church-&s;treet, We&s;tmin&s;ter, and for whom our poet had ever a warmer affection than for any other of his bro|thers.</P>
<P>It afforded no &s;mall joy to our hero's father and mother to &s;ee &s;o cordial an affection &s;ub&s;i&s;ting be|tween their &s;ons; and the old gen|tleman being extremely de&s;irous of having Charles well &s;ettled, did his utmo&s;t endeavours to procure him &s;ome preferment in the church; but, for want of intere&s;t, was di&s;|appointed in his intention, to his very great regret.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="94">
Our poet was mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly mor|tified to find he was &s;o neglected. Independent of the rea&s;on he had to expect &s;ome good living from his acknowledged merit and abili|ties, he had a &s;till &s;tronger expec|tation of it from the promi&s;es he had received from &s;ome pretended friends; who had weight and in|fluence enough to have &s;erved him, had they been &s;o inclinable.</P>
<P>The truth is, they found Mr. Churchill was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of abilities &s;uperior to mo&s;t; that he was en|dued, in particular, with &s;uch a &s;atyrical vein, that they dreaded, &s;hould he be put into any good be|nefice, he would la&s;h the indolence and ignorance of many of the &s;u|perior clergy, &s;o roughly, that they
<PB N="105" REF="95">
would &s;o &s;mart with the angui&s;h, as to be incapable of returning the favour. On this account, they de|termined to keep him as low as po&s;&s;ible; well knowing, that an irritated, independent wit is a mo&s;t dangerous enemy for the unworthy part of the clergy to cope with.</P>
<P>Hed merit and genius any claim to preferment, there is no doubt but our bard had been exalted to the highe&s;t. But &s;ince there were &s;uch ungenerous methods taken to prevent his ri&s;ing in the church, it is no wonder that his highe&s;t pre|ferment was, his &s;ucceeding his fa|ther as lecturer and curate of St. John's, on the death of the latter, which happened but a &s;hort time after our poet's return from Wales.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="96">
In this &s;ituation he continued for &s;ome time, doing his duty con&s;ci|entiou&s;ly and properly, and being regarded in the mo&s;t amiable light by all tho&s;e that had the plea&s;ure of his acquaintance.</P>
<P>But even now his finances were but &s;canty, and he had been accu&s;|tomed to live well. Rather than content him&s;elf with &s;ub&s;i&s;ting on his &s;alary, which amounted to a bare hundred a year, and live an inactive kind of life, he cho&s;e to labour harder, and take more pains, to enable him&s;elf to live more gen|teelly.</P>
<P>The office he took on him wa that of u&s;her to Mrs. Dennis' boarding-&s;chool, teaching the youn
<PB N="107" REF="97">
ladies to write the Engli&s;h tongue gra mmatically, correctly, and ele|gantly; a branch of learning which, tho' generally neglected, is of more importance than the world in general imagine!</P>
<P>Is it not &s;trange, that &s;uch va&s;t pains are taken to fa&s;hion the bodies of the youth of either &s;ex, to teach them all kind of orna|mental accompli&s;hments, and yet neglect the cultivation of their minds, and omit the u&s;eful quali|fications, as things of no moment?</P>
<P>Very few young ladies, very few young gentlemen, are prevented from having the utmo&s;t pains taken with them, at great expence of time and money, to learn them to
<PB N="108" REF="98">
dance, to &s;ing, to play on different in&s;truments of mu&s;ic, and to un|der&s;tand French; all of which branches of education, though confe&s;&s;edly of u&s;e, they have no occa&s;ion to &s;hew them&s;elves mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es and ma&s;ters of, perhaps, ten times in a year; but to &s;peak, read, and write their native tongue cor|rectly and elegantly, which they have occa&s;ion to make u&s;e of every day of their lives, little pains are taken, little expence be&s;towed, to make them proficients in.&mdash;This important, tho' neglected branch of education, to Mrs. Dennis's ho|nour be it &s;poken, is taught at her &s;chool.</P>
<P>It is no wonder that, in this &s;i|tuation in life, our poet gave great
<PB N="109" REF="99">
&s;atisfaction. Ma&s;ter as he was of an elegance of compo&s;ition, and thoroughly conver&s;ant in the diver|&s;ities of &s;tyle, he &s;aw in a moment, when the various pieces the young ladies had written were &s;hewn to him, their different excellencies, and their different errors. He pointed out both to them, made them &s;en&s;ible wherein con&s;i&s;ted the beauty of the former; and taught them how to remedy the defects of the latter.</P>
<P>But a mind like our poet's was not to be bounded within the li|mits of a lecture&s;hip, or the pale of a &s;chool. The dull, tedious, in|&s;ipid work, of continually repeat|ing over the &s;ame form of words, (though confe&s;&s;edly the mo&s;t noble in the world, the mo&s;t perfect the

<L>" Turn'd them to &s;hape, and gave to airy nothing</L>
<L>" A local habitation and a name."</L><BIBL>SHAKES.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>After being, therefore, at Mrs Dennis's about &s;eventeen months he began to be tired, as well a a&s;hamed of his &s;ervile employ+ment: and, to recreate his mind
<PB N="111" REF="101">
after being quite jaded with the fatigues of his u&s;her&s;hip, he &s;aun|tered away to the playhou&s;e, where he knew his dulne&s;s would be cha&s;ed away, and his melancholy expelled.</P>
<P>So di&s;cerning a per&s;on as our poet could not frequent the theatre long before he was thoroughly acquaint|ed with the merits and defects of the actors. He thought, that a work, pointing them out, would be of public utility; as it would enter|tain the town, and induce the &s;ons of the drama, who live on the pub|lic favour, to &s;train every nerve, to exert all their abilities, to excel in their profe&s;&s;ion, and render them|&s;elves &s;till more worthy of the coun|tenance
<PB N="112" REF="102">
and encouragement of the public.</P>
<P>This work he determined at|tempting. He had, indeed, hi|therto, written but few pieces; and tho&s;e were chiefly &s;ongs and epi|grams, which were never publi&s;hed, and only handed about among his mo&s;t particular and intimate friends. However, he doubted not, but he had abilities &s;ufficient to do ju&s;tice to his &s;ubject; he having, in one material re&s;pect, the advantage of mo&s;t of the writers that had pre|ceded him; which was, no &s;ort of connection, or intimacy, with any player whatever; &s;o that, being en|tirely unbia&s;&s;ed by per&s;onal friend|&s;hip, or re&s;entment, his mu&s;e might

cen&s;ure with candour, and prai&s;e without adulation.</P>
<P>Our poet, however, could not enter upon this work &s;o &s;oon as he willingly would, on account of &s;ome private di&s;tre&s;&s;es he laboured under. His income ari&s;ing from his lecture|&s;hip and u&s;her&s;hip was but narrow, and his &s;pirit was great. His living by far exceeded his revenues, which obliged him to contract debts he was incapable of di&s;charging, and gave him no &s;mall unea&s;ine&s;s, his hou&s;e being continually blocked up by his creditors and &s;urrounded by bailiffs.</P>
<P>But this was not all the vexation he laboured under. About this time, &s;ome dome&s;tic di&s;putes, &s;till
<PB N="114" REF="104">
more afflicting, happened. Mrs. Churchill and he had frequent quar|rels; and a &s;eparation was talked of, and de&s;ired by both as advantageous to both.</P>
<P>It is by no means incumbent on me, as a biographer, or a man, to enter into circum&s;tances of this na|ture, and relate the origin and pro|gre&s;s of &s;uch an unhappy di&s;&s;ention. Private family affairs are unfit for the public eye. They are of too tender and too delicate a nature to be divulged. Suffice it, that our poet and his lady DID NOT AGREE. To &s;ay more, would be to injure one of the parties at the expence of the other.</P>
<P>His debts were, however, &s;oon di&s;charged, or his creditors &s;atisfied,
<PB N="115" REF="105">
by the benevolence of Mr. Lloyd; and our hero then determined, he would retard his work no longer, but proceed on it in&s;tantly.</P>
<P>About the time of his forming this re&s;olution, his late ingenious friend, Mr. Robert Lloyd, the &s;on of the before-mentioned gentleman, publi&s;hed a poetical epi&s;tle, called The Actor; which was addre&s;&s;ed to Mr. Bonnel Thornton, and was looked on as a piece of infinite me|rit, and its author ranked among the mo&s;t eminent writers of the age.</P>
<P>Fired by his friend's example, animated with a laudable emulation, our poet &s;at down and compo&s;ed his Ro&s;ciad. A work which enters in|to
<PB N="116" REF="106">
a clo&s;e and minute di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the various excellencies and faults of the &s;everal actors and actre&s;&s;es of both theatres; a&s;cribing due prai&s;es to tho&s;e who were eminent in their different walks (to u&s;e a theatrical phra&s;e) and &s;atiri&s;ing tho&s;e who, buoyed up on the bladders of &s;elf|conceit, imagined them&s;elves great actors; when, to u&s;e a well-known, though &s;omewhat coar&s;e &s;imile, they might be compared to pieces of hor&s;e-dung, which &s;wimming down a river with &s;ome golden-pippins, proudly cried out, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"See how we apples &s;wim!"</Q></P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed his piece, he pub|li&s;hed it, but without &s;etting his name to it as its author. The town were divided in their &s;entiments
<PB N="117" REF="107">
concerning its writer, but allowed it va&s;t merit. Unwilling to a&s;cribe &s;o much fame to one alone, it was &s;aid, it was the off-&s;pring of a com|bination of wits. The authors of the Critical Review, in particular, pronounced, point-blank, it was written by Lloyd. They valued them&s;elves, they &s;aid, on knowing any author by his &s;tyle; and, how|ever the common herd of critics might be impo&s;ed on by a fal&s;e judgment, they affirmed it was im|po&s;&s;ible to deceive them, the &s;kil|ful veterans of the age. Others de|clared, it was the joint-production of Lloyd, Thornton, and Colman; and the rea&s;on they gave for their opinion was &s;omewhat &s;ingular; be|cau&s;e, they &s;aid, no one man was capable of producing &s;o fini&s;hed a piece.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="108">
The&s;e &s;agacious veteran critics, and others, were, however, &s;hewn their error in judgment on the pub|lication of the &s;econd edition, which came out with the name of its au|thor.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AMONG the many honour|able friends and acquaint|ances our hero gained by the pub|lication
<PB N="120" REF="110">
of his Ro&s;ciad, may be reckoned Mr. Garrick; who gave him the freedom of his hou&s;e, and entered into the &s;tricte&s;t intimacy with him.</P>
<P>Shortly after the Critical Re|viewers had thought proper to at|tack his piece, by giving a lame and injudicious account of it, and, according to their u&s;ual cu&s;tom, &s;e|lecting &s;ome of the wor&s;t lines they could find in it, and giving them as &s;pecimens of the work; our poet thought proper to publi&s;h his Apo|logy, addre&s;&s;ed to them; in which he &s;everely la&s;hes tho&s;e p&s;eudo-cri|tics, tho&s;e &s;elf-appointed cen&s;ors, who have forced them&s;elves into the chair of Ari&s;tarchus, with a view to direct the public ta&s;te, and who
<PB N="121" REF="111">
filch away the reputations of the good and great, with as little re|mor&s;e as hardened high waymen &s;teal pur&s;es.</P>
<P>They were extremely nettled with the ju&s;t &s;atire they had drawn on them&s;elves, and would have recant|ed; would have begged our poet's pardon; would have fallen down on their marrow-bones; and, like naughty &s;chool-boys, when con|victed of a fault, would have pro|mi&s;ed never to do &s;o again; but our poet de&s;pi&s;ed them too much to heed their &s;uppliant po&s;ture, or their pi|tiful promi&s;es. He was equally unconcerned at their in&s;idious ma|lice and their avowed repentance.</P>
<P>The town was extremely diverted at the poor devils expence. They
<PB N="122" REF="112">
had never been &s;o thoroughly &s;courged before. They had brought an enemy on them they knew not how to get rid of; and &s;uch an enemy as neither their numbers could daunt, or their bribes cor|rupt.</P>
<P>The&s;e a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inators of mens cha|racters began now to &s;ear. Con&s;ci|ous guilt hallood in their ears the infamy of their proceedings; the infamy in depreciating the works of the learned and ingenious; and injuring the property of the pur|cha&s;ers of tho&s;e works. They would gladly have le&s;t off their a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tion trade; but, alas! if they did, they mu&s;t not cat; for every meal of victuals they procure, is pur|cha&s;ed at the expence of the bleed|ing
<PB N="123" REF="113">
reputation of &s;ome man of worth.</P>
<P>Our hero's fame being greatly extended by the&s;e productions, and his pockets filled, the fir&s;t two edi|tions of the Ro&s;ciad only bringing him in three hundred pounds, he came to a re&s;olution of depending entirely on his mu&s;e for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; and he made no doubt of meeting the public favour as long as he &s;hould continue to merit it.</P>
<P>But to do this, he con&s;idered his gown as an in&s;uperable ob&s;tacle. While he wore it, he could not, with propriety, frequent many places; which, as an author, who mu&s;t &s;ee life in all its variegated &s;cenes, if he would paint them, it
<PB N="124" REF="114">
was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for him to do. All, therefore, for him to con|&s;ider, was, whether he would be a lecturer and curate, with a bare hundred a year, or a lay-author, with a goodly pro&s;pect of gaining fifteen hundred.</P>
<P>He cho&s;e the latter. He threw a&s;ide his gown, and commenced lay|man; and, though he was blamed for it by &s;ome, and ridiculed by others, yet I cannot but think, for my own part, that he acted per|fectly right; and I doubt not but the unprejudiced and intelligent will be of the &s;ame opinion, after they have peru&s;ed the following let|ter he &s;ent to me by the penny-po&s;t on that occa&s;ion.<LETTER REND="inline margQuotes">

<P>Our poet having thus thrown a&s;ide his gown, behaved as any other gen|tleman, with &s;imilar inclinations, would do. He frequented taverns
<PB N="128" REF="118">
and coffee-hou&s;es, places of public diver&s;ion, got acquainted with bucks and bloods, and people of all &s;orts of characters; and, in order to &s;ee low as well as high life, did not di&s;dain &s;ometimes to go into ob&s;cure public-hou&s;es, the better to ob&s;erve the different &s;cenes which different places would afford.</P>
<P>The&s;e actions have been imputed as a di&s;grace to him; as reflecting on his moral character, and tend|ing to le&s;&s;en him in the eyes of the public. With &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, we are of a different opinion. We think he acted extremely right; and that an author like him, who would ren|der him&s;elf capable of exhibiting portraits of the different &s;tations of life, and humours of different men,

could not do better than to be an eye-witne&s;s of tho&s;e different &s;tati|ons and humours. An author who thinks to paint &s;cenes he never &s;aw, mu&s;t make a very poor hand of it. His de&s;criptions mu&s;t re&s;emble no|thing in the heavens above, the earth beneath, or waters under the earth: but an author po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tolerable abilities, if &s;pectator of tho&s;e &s;cenes he de&s;cribes, mu&s;t, by far, excel one with the highe&s;t, who never &s;aw tho&s;e things he attempts to give his readers an idea of.</P>
<P>Thus much we thought proper to ob&s;erve in ju&s;tification of our poet; and we beg leave farther to ob&s;erve, in ju&s;tification of our own remark, and as a proof of its &s;oli|dity, that, had not Mr. Churchill

acted as he did, in frequenting &s;o many public places, and &s;eeing &s;o many characters of different kinds, the world would not have &s;uch highly-fini&s;hed de&s;criptions of per|&s;ons and things from his pen, as it now can boa&s;t of.</P>

<P>Tri&s;tram Shandy was offered to divers Book&s;ellers for fifty pounds, and they offered &s;even. The au|thor printed the fir&s;t edition on his own account, and cleared upwards of two hundred pounds by the &s;ale. Mr. Dod&s;ley then purcha&s;ed the copy, and has gained much money by it.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. CHURCHILL gaining mo|ney now a-pace, had it in his power to di&s;play the native tem|per of his mind; which was, an unre&s;trained benevolence, that was
<PB N="136" REF="126">
ever exerted in relieving the di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>His mo&s;t intimate friend, and brother bard, was at this time ar|re&s;ted for &s;ome debts he was inca|pable of di&s;charging, and thrown in the Fleet. Every one lamented the fate of &s;o great a genius, and were &s;orry at his misfortunes; but no one, except Churchill, offered to give him any thing but&mdash;pity; a poor gift, and a &s;canty diet for a man to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on!</P>
<P>Our hero, who could not &s;ee his friend's di&s;tre&s;&s;es with apathy, vi|&s;ited him almo&s;t daily; and, with a genero&s;ity unparalleled in the&s;e days, gave Kear&s;ly, the book&s;eller, orders to &s;end him a guinea every
<PB N="137" REF="127">
week, and charge it to his account; which was accordingly done.</P>
<P>Is not this a &s;triking proof of his goodne&s;s, his greatne&s;s of mind? Is not &s;uch a generous action &s;uf|ficient to atone for many faults? Can an equal in&s;tance of humanity and true friend&s;hip be produced by any per&s;on, if the circum&s;tances of the donor be compared with our bard's? Let, then, ye &s;narling, envious poeta&s;ters, ye tiny witlings, ye mongrel authors, who fea&s;t on an inharmonious line with as much greedine&s;s as a hound will devour carrion, regardle&s;s of the nervous &s;entiment, and incapable of feeling the beauty of a friendly, a humane, a moral, a Chri&s;tian action: let then the &s;acred a&s;hes of our poet
<PB N="138" REF="128">
re&s;t in peace! With more than &s;a|vage bruti&s;hne&s;s, call not up his errors from the grave! Cull not, with a villainous indu&s;try, &s;ome few foibles, which, as a man, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; which, as a poet, his whirl of imagination might lead him into, to &s;erve them up as a fea&s;t for knaves and villains! Imi|tate his virtues, and, if po&s;&s;ible, acquire his abilities; but let his faults be buried with his du&s;t! Let the green turf lie lightly on his brea&s;t; and tear not away, with &s;acrilegious hands, the lawrelled wreath that binds his honoured brows!</P>
<P>The next work our poet pub|li&s;hed was Night, addre&s;&s;ed to Mr. Robert Lloyd: a piece which, tho'
<PB N="139" REF="129">
written with great &s;pirit, and re|plete with true poetry, is the mo&s;t exceptionable of any of his per|formances; it being grounded up|on fal&s;e principles. The chief de|&s;ign of it &s;eems to be, to prove, that, whatever follies we po&s;&s;e&s;s, we &s;hould not undertake to conceal them.</P>
<P>That this doctrine is e&s;&s;entially fal&s;e, and is ab&s;olutely baneful to &s;ociety, is evident, if we only con|&s;ider, that example is ever more prevalent than precept. If the abandoned and the wicked were to take no pains to conceal their &s;eve|ral crimes, e&s;pecially were they in high &s;tations, other people would think them&s;elves ju&s;tifiable in imi|tating them; perhaps, laudable;
<PB N="140" REF="130">
&s;ince the commonalty look on it as extremely prai&s;e-worthy to ape their betters, not only in fa&s;hions and follies, but vices; and the gentry &s;eem to be of the &s;ame opinion, by their imitating, as near as po&s;&s;ible, the nobility.</P>
<P>After the publication of this piece, he wrote his Gho&s;t: a work of va&s;t merit; in which he di&s;plays great knowledge of the world, rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> genius, and &s;heer wit. The only fault I can find with this perform|ance, is, his indulging a vein of &s;a|tire rather too &s;evere; particularly, his attacking &s;ome re&s;pectable cha|racters with too much wanton cru|elty.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e Mr. John&s;on &s;tands fore|mo&s;t. A gentleman of great repu|tation
<PB N="141" REF="131">
as a &s;cholar, and a wit; a man with &s;uch a comprehen&s;ive mind, as to under&s;tand mo&s;t &s;ub|jects &s;o thoroughly, as would lead one to &s;u&s;pect he had made the &s;tudy of each the &s;ole bu&s;ine&s;s of his life. This gentleman is there characte|rized under the name of Pompo&s;o, and la&s;hed with a &s;everity he had by no means de&s;erved of our poet. But indeed the edge of the &s;atire is entirely taken off, when it is con|&s;idered, that every one that reads the character, knows Mr. John&s;on is the author of The Rambler: a work which has enlarged the circle of moral enquiry, and fixed more preci&s;e land-marks to guide philo|&s;ophy in her inve&s;tigation of truth.</P>
<P>The Prophecy of Famine &s;uc|ceeded the Gho&s;t. It had a rapid
<PB N="142" REF="132">
and a prodigious &s;ale; was univer|&s;ally approved, except by tho&s;e who felt the keenne&s;s of its &s;courge.</P>
<P>But why &s;hould I give an ac|count of his poems he publi&s;hed, HERE? That I &s;hall do, perhaps, at &s;ome future time; only I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay &s;omething of his fir&s;t publications, in order the bet|ter to account for that degree of fame and popularity he experi|enced.</P>

<P>The antient clergy lived very different from our modern, and acted very different. The time hath been, too, when rich bene|fices, and fat livings were be|&s;towed on the pious and the learned.&mdash;Are they &s;o now? No. They are not. They are fre|quently given to ignorance and
<PB N="148" REF="138">
impiety, and always to the per|&s;on that has intere&s;t.&mdash;I defy any one to a&s;&s;ign a rational cau&s;e for &s;o irrational a conduct.</P>
<P>Why a worthy and a learned man, who di&s;charges all the du|ties of his function with a con|&s;cientious exactne&s;s, who&s;e life is a written comment on his doc|trine, and who has a numerous family to provide for, &s;hould be puni&s;hed for his piety and learn|ing, in being forced to live on a poor &s;tipend a journeyman taylor or a cobler would &s;corn to accept, is, to the eye of impartial rea|&s;on, amazing. But is it le&s;s &s;o, to find a man, who preaches not three times a year, who never performs the duties of his func|tion,
<PB N="149" REF="139">
who&s;e life is mean and &s;candalous, and who has neither capacity nor integrity to act the man, or the divine, rewarded with thou&s;ands a year?</P>
<P>How did the primitive clergy live?&mdash;Did they order the earth, air, and &s;ea to be ran&s;acked for their re&s;pective dainties? Were they, like our modern &s;u|perior clergy, driven about, loll|ing in &s;uperb vehicles, and drawn by fiery &s;teeds, to places of diver|&s;ion, and fal&s;e gaiety? No; they were not; nor did they in any re&s;pect live as our modern black|gown'd gentry do.</P>
<P>Survey, for a moment, my dear * * * *, the infinite con|tra&s;t
<PB N="150" REF="140">
between antient and modern religion.&mdash;The religion of Je&s;us was plain, &s;imple, pure, and holy. Its prie&s;ts were of blame|le&s;s life, of upright manners; clad in mean apparel; dignified with no titles, but Servants of the Lord. Their food was mean, and often, &s;canty; their journeys, tedious and frequent; their ac|commodations, mean and wretch|ed; their per&s;ons, expo&s;ed to pe|rils; and their deaths, painful and ignominious.</P>
<P>But, good God! what a con|tra&s;t!&mdash;Pomp and &s;plendor are the characteri&s;tics of our church. Our prie&s;ts are wanton, la&s;civi|ous, and depraved. Their ap|parel &s;uperb and &s;ingular, calcu|lated

</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. CHURCHILL continued at Paris about three months, and then returned to London.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="145">
On account of &s;ome political pieces he publi&s;hed, his fame was now in its meridian. He was re|garded as a &s;kilful politician, as well as a great poet. He was, in|deed, looked on as one of the mo&s;t formidable champions in the cau&s;e of Liberty and Britain, again&s;t do|me&s;tic treachery, and Scottified mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>He thought the intere&s;t of his country was &s;acrificed at the &s;hrine of perfidy; that great villains rob|bed the public with impunity; that vice prevailed, and impious men bore &s;way, while &s;kill and inte|grity were driven from the helm of &s;tate, and di&s;carded with di&s;|grace.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="146">
He was not &s;ingular in the&s;e no|tions. Every hone&s;t, unplaced, un|pen&s;ioned, independent Engli&s;hman thought the &s;ame. But more cau|tious, or rather, more timid, than our patriotic bard, they dared not whi&s;per, in &s;uch perilous times, when pro&s;ecutions, and pillories, and fines, and general warrants, and impri&s;onments, and expen&s;ive journeys, were become &s;o frequent, and when brow-beating a------y|g------ls held the &s;courge of law over the heads of tho&s;e who were bold enough to own them&s;elves friends and lovers of their country&punc; they did not, I &s;ay, dare to whi&s;pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> tho&s;e &s;entiments our poet openly avowed, and gloried in.</P>
<P>He was frequently threatened o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> account of his generous attachme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">
<PB N="157" REF="147">
to the cau&s;e of liberty. Several very menacing letters were &s;ent to him in private, and frequent de|nunciations appeared again&s;t him in the public papers, with a view to &s;hake his integrity, and bla&s;t his future fame, to bring him over to the other party, and to induce him to e&s;pou&s;e, by his di&s;cour&s;e and writings, tho&s;e principles, and vin|dicate tho&s;e mea&s;ures, he had be|fore abhorred, and pronounced baneful to his country, and preju|dicial to its true intere&s;t.</P>
<P>But this was not all. Promi&s;es were al&s;o made, and a&s;&s;urances given, of high rewards and prefer|ments, if he would join the m---y, cry up the glorious and honourable peace, and write again&s;t tho&s;e faith|ful
<PB N="158" REF="148">
&s;ervants of the crown, who had &s;erved their country with &s;kill and fidelity, and rai&s;ed her reputa|tion to the highe&s;t degree of &s;plen|dor, from the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t ab|ject &s;ituation conceivable, when &s;he had been in&s;ulted and p----d on by almo&s;t every &s;tate in Europe.</P>
<P>He was al&s;o to call in his writ|ings, an avaricious, cowardly, weal|thy d----e, who took a beating at a public hor&s;e-race, a generous, brave, and hone&s;t man&mdash;An igno|rant and pu&s;illanimous p--e-m-k-r, a learned and upright mini&s;ter&mdash;A cricket-player, debauchee, and in|former, a very pious, cha&s;te, and worthy gentleman. In &s;hort, he was to nick-name every thing; to pro&s;titute his con&s;cience, and his
<PB N="159" REF="149">
pen; to depreciate and vilify his country and countrymen; and to lavi&s;h the mo&s;t boundle&s;s panegyric upon Scotland and Scot&s;men.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;hallow, &s;econd-&s;ighted, Scottified &s;tate&s;men, could not have applied to a more improper per&s;on than our bard. He was equally un|moved at their threats and promi&s;es. He de&s;pi&s;ed the men and mea&s;ures too heartily to vindicate them; he loved his country and her patriots too &s;incerely to betray them.</P>
<P>Finding our poet proof again&s;t their artifices, or force; and that he &s;tood like a rock again&s;t which the furious winds bellow, and waves beat in vain; two of the m------'s agents propo&s;ed to him, that, &s;ince
<PB N="160" REF="150">
he could not be brought to concur in, and e&s;pou&s;e their cau&s;e openly, and by his writings, that, if he would only promi&s;e, on his honour, not to write again&s;t them, he &s;hould be paid three hundred a year for his &s;ilence.</P>
<P>To this propo&s;al the bard gave this an&s;wer: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am amazed you &s;hould think I would accept &s;o infamous an offer. To be &s;ilent, when viewing treachery and vil|lainy, and not to expo&s;e them, is to be a partaker; and pen&s;ioners J-----n and G----e are not le&s;s inf----s for con&s;enting to drop their pens, than if they had wrote for the pre&s;ent adm---n."</Q></P>
<P>Fain would the two agents have prevailed on the poet to change his
<PB N="161" REF="151">
re&s;olution; fain would they have per&s;uaded him to have &s;apped the foundations of liberty, to have vin|dicated arbitrary and illegal mea|&s;ures, and to have proved a ba&s;tard|&s;on of his country. But they might as well have attempted to have torn up the rooted oak; to have called in que&s;tion the wi&s;dom and inte|grity of a Temple; to have &s;haken down the mighty battlements; or, like another Samp&s;on, pull down the &s;trong pillars of Gaza.</P>
<P>They laboured extremely hard to effect their purpo&s;e; which our poet con&s;idering as a direct implication and &s;u&s;picion of his integrity, his anger ro&s;e to &s;o high a pitch, that he &s;wore, if they did not leave his hou&s;e that moment, he would kick them out of doors.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="152">
Not choo&s;ing to give him this trouble, they decamped with pre|cipitation, fearing our poet would be as good as his word; but not before he had a&s;&s;ured them, that, if they ever dared to come to his hou&s;e again on &s;uch errands, he would cut off their ears.</P>
<P>Our bard's behaviour on this oc|ca&s;ion, has induced his enemies to repre&s;ent him as a turbulent man. They may call him, indeed, a man of &s;pirit and a man of integrity; but &s;ure I am, every true lover of his country, <Q REND="inline">"with courage to have made his love known,"</Q> would have acted as he did.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Our poet's manner of life at his hou&s;e on Acton-common&mdash;His quarrel with Hogarth truly &s;tated&mdash;The painter's print occa&s;ions the poet's epi&s;tle&mdash;The effects the latter had on Hogarth&mdash;Our bard's di&s;pute with D****n L***h &s;lightly touched on, and why.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>OUR poet now lived very com|fortably and very happily. He wanted not for money, nor for friends. He had taken a very genteel, well-built hou&s;e on Acton-common, which he furni&s;hed ex|tremely elegant; kept his po&s;t|chai&s;e, &s;addle-hor&s;es, and his point|ers; fi&s;hed, fowled, hunted, cour&s;ed,
<PB N="164" REF="154">
and took all the diver&s;ions of the &s;ea&s;on he approved, at tho&s;e hours he retired from &s;tudy; and lived in an independent, ea&s;y manner every man of genius ought to do, but which every man of genius cannot afford.</P>
<P>His writings in favour of that admini&s;tration that brought glory and honour to Great-Britain, and &s;trengthened its intere&s;t; among others, had given offence to Ho|garth, the ingenious, and truly co|mic painter, who&s;e works will im|mortali&s;e his name; who, having a place at court, as &s;erjeant-painter, e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of that admini|&s;tration that brought inf--y and di&s;h----r to Britain, and that MADE THE PEACE OF 1763.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="155">
The bard and painter having no|tice that the other would attend a late remarkable trial at We&s;tmin|&s;ter-hall, came there with a view to exerci&s;e their different functions; the bard to &s;atiri&s;e his antagoni&s;t for abu&s;ing Mr. Pitt, and other great &s;tate&s;men; and the painter to catch a ridiculous likene&s;s of the poet, &s;o as to repre&s;ent him in caricature.</P>
<P>They &s;aw each other, and, after the trial was over, departed.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently comes out a print of a bear hugging a full pot of porter in his paws; underneath, a pug|dog pi&s;&s;ing on Mr. Churchill's works; with &s;ome other circum|&s;tances the reader need not be told.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="156">
It would puzzle the mo&s;t pene|trating per&s;on, had he the eyes of Lynceus, to &s;ee the wit of all this; but, le&s;t it &s;hould be lo&s;t, at the bottom is wrote, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The reverend Mr. Churchill, in the character of a Ru&s;&s;ian bear."</Q></P>
<P>Alas! Alas! It is but a too me|lancholy truth of the frailty of hu|man nature, and a too vi&s;ible proof of the decline of genius, that Ho|garth, a painter, in his peculiar walk, rivalled by none, &s;uperior to all, &s;hould, to indulge a per&s;onal re&s;entment, publi&s;h a fooli&s;h, tri|fling, in&s;ignificant print, to prove&mdash;what?&mdash;why, that he hated Mr. Churchill, and that his own abilities were quite decayed.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="157">
Glad &s;hould I have been, had our poet di&s;dained taking notice of it; though the world would there|by have been deprived of a fine, nervous, manly piece of writing, that breathes a &s;pirit of poetry and humanity, equally honourable to the bard and to the man.</P>
<P>Hogarth was my friend and my companion. I honoured him, and loved him; and I could not, with|out the mo&s;t poignant grief, behold the extreme indignation he te&s;tified in reading the former part of our poet's epi&s;tle, his Ru&s;&s;ian Bear had occa&s;ioned; and the compunction of &s;oul he felt in reading the con|clu&s;ion, where the generous bard pays him greater compliments, and lavi&s;hes higher encomiums on him,
<PB N="168" REF="158">
as a painter, and with more ju&s;tice, than the united compliments and encomiums that had been given him by all former authors and poets.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, the &s;everity of our poet's &s;atire, the ju&s;tne&s;s of his remarks, and the warmth of his panegyric, broke the painter's heart. Though I cannot ab&s;olutely believe this, yet, I believe, it contributed not a little towards it; e&s;pecially if we con&s;ider, that, for &s;ome months after the publication of the print and epi&s;tle, poor Hogarth was la&s;hed mo&s;t unmercifully in all the public papers; his defenders were illiterate and without genius, rather betraying his cau&s;e than &s;erving it; and, as is too frequently the ca&s;e, hurting him by their injudicious prai&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="159" MS="y">
Our poet had al&s;o &s;ome di&s;putes with D****n L***h, his quon|dam printer; but, as that affair is &s;o recent in every one's memory, and &s;o generally known, I &s;hall not give an account of it here. I mu&s;t, however, beg leave to ob&s;erve, that, however faultle&s;s our poet might be, in his quarrel with the painter, I can &s;carcely think he was entirely &s;o in that with the printer; as Mr. L***h is a very hone&s;t, de&s;erving man, and a very intelligent and good arti&s;t.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE friend&s;hip of Pylades and Ore&s;tes was not greater, or more &s;incere, than the friend&s;hip of Churchill, Wilkes, and Lloyd. This triumvirate had a real e&s;teem for each other; and would have gone to the utmo&s;t limits of the earth, or performed any arduous ta&s;k, within their power, to have &s;erved their friend.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="161">
There are fewer friends on earth than kings, is an antient &s;aying, and is a true one. Whenever, therefore, we meet with &s;uch a phoenix as faithful friends, we ought to look on them in the mo&s;t amia|ble light, and regard them as we regard comets, or eclip&s;es; e&s;peci|ally, if tho&s;e friends, like the three above named, are endued with great and extraordinary abilities, and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of an integrity of &s;oul, and fortitude of mind, which adver&s;e fortune cannot daunt, or the mo&s;t pro&s;perous circum&s;tances enervate.</P>
<P>Our poet longed &s;o exceedingly to &s;ee his friend Wilkes, who had been exiled his country by the ri|gorous hands of power, for writing&mdash;his &s;entiments, and who had
<PB N="172" REF="162">
taken refuge in France, that he &s;et out in his po&s;t-chai&s;e for Dover; from whence he cro&s;&s;ed over to Ca|lais, and immediately proceeded to Boulogne, where Mr. Wilkes was.</P>
<P>Their meeting was joyful and affectionate. They thought them|&s;elves extremely happy, after &s;o long an ab&s;ence, to enjoy each other's &s;ociety; and they plumed them&s;elves on the &s;atisfaction they &s;hould receive in a reciprocal com|munication of &s;entiments and plans they had formed for their future conduct.</P>
<P>But, alas! how tran&s;itory are all &s;ublunary things; how fleeting and uncertain!&mdash;The pre&s;ent moment only is ours; the next we are not a&s;&s;ured of!&mdash;Like the ba&s;ele&s;s fa|bric
<PB N="173" REF="163">
of a dream, we &s;ee our goodly pro&s;pects in life vani&s;h away, when we awake to immortality from this bed of death.</P>
<P>Shall I pur&s;ue the &s;ubject? No. There is no occa&s;ion.&mdash;Shall I re|late the &s;equel of poor Churchill's life?&mdash;Fain would I di&s;pen&s;e with it!&mdash;Would it were not in my power!</P>
<P>In &s;hort, our bard, a few days after his arrival at Boulogne, was &s;eized with a malignant fever, and was &s;en&s;ible his time was come.</P>
<P>To expre&s;s the angui&s;h of &s;oul Wilkes felt, requires a pen like his own to de&s;cribe; or, rather, it is unde&s;cribable. He felt all the pangs and tortures human nature can feel,
