<P>I SELDOM write Dedications. Whenever I have written one, it has been from an impul&s;e of veneration, or of tender grati|tude. THE BELLE's STRATAGEM I de|dicated to <HI>her Maje&s;ty</HI>; THE TOWN BEFORE YOU is dedicated to <HI>you.</HI></P>
<P>The virtues which you practi&s;e in your elegant pavilions at GASSARY, have
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
reach'd the Briti&s;h &s;hores. Their reputa|tion now echoes back again to tho&s;e of the Ganges; and I would per&s;uade my&s;elf that I may be the cau&s;e of extending it &s;till farther. Yes, I would hope that this humble pen may &s;peak to tho&s;e of after times, and tell them that you <HI>quietly</HI> per|form &s;uch acts of graceful goodne&s;s, as open a thou&s;and mouths in your prai&s;e, whil&s;t you per&s;uade your&s;elf that all is &s;ecret, and that no one finds you out to be more amiable and re&s;pected, than the generality of human creatures.</P>
<P>This &s;elf deception is a little help'd on, by him, to whom of all earthly beings you are bound to look up. He <HI>aids</HI> your charming impo&s;itions&mdash;he <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;ts</HI> you in fixing fetters of gratitude on all around you, and then per&s;uades him&s;elf and you, that Heaven alone is privy to the deed. But you could not hope always to go on
<PB N="vii" REF="5">
in this &s;ort of concealment&mdash;at length you are unveil'd!</P>
<P>I am unable to mea&s;ure the extent of my private obligations to you; but may this public acknowledgement of them con|vince you that they throb in my heart, and that I mu&s;t be</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following is rather the Comedy which the Public have cho&s;en it to be, than the Comedy which I intended. Some things have been left out, and &s;ome have been added &s;ince the fir&s;t repre&s;entation: In &s;hort, the Comedy has been <HI>new cla&s;s'd</HI>&mdash;it has been torn from its genus.</P>
<P>It is hoped, however, that there may be found cha|racters, in THE TOWN BEFORE YOU, to intere&s;t, and &s;ituations to attach; and that tho&s;e events which were vivacity in the Theatre, will not be dulne&s;s in the clo&s;et.</P>
<P>But it mu&s;t be noticed, that the &s;cene, in the &s;econd act, between TIPPY and his Landlady, and that in the fifth act, between TIPPY and the Bailiff, were no part of my original de&s;ign. They were written during the illne&s;s of MRS. POPE, after the Piece had been played &s;everal nights. Alas! I am &s;orry to remark, that no &s;cenes in the Comedy (to u&s;e the Stage idiom) <HI>go off</HI> better.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="7">An acute Critic lately &s;aid, in one of tho&s;e a&s;&s;emblies where conver&s;ation, though &s;ometimes light, is &s;eldom without meaning, "A Comedy to plea&s;e, in the pre&s;ent day, mu&s;t be <HI>made,</HI> not written." It requires no great expan&s;e of comprehen&s;ion to perceive the meaning of this dogma; the truth of which I am equally ready to acknowledge, and to deplore: But &s;hould it <HI>want</HI> illu&s;|tration, it may be found every week in a popular Piece, where a great Actor, holding a &s;word in his left hand, and making aukward pu&s;hes with it, charms the audience infinitely more than he could do, by all the wit and ob&s;ervation which the ingenious Author might have given him; and brings down &s;uch applau&s;es, as the bewitching dialogue of CIBBER, and of FAR|QUHAR pants for in vain!</P>
<P>The patient developement of character, the repeated touches which colour it up to Nature, and &s;well it into identity and exi&s;tence (and which gave celebrity to CONGREVE), we have now no reli&s;h for. The com|binations of intere&s;t, the &s;trokes which are meant to reach the heart, we are equally incapable of ta&s;ting. LAUGH! LAUGH! LAUGH! is the demand: Not a word mu&s;t be uttered that looks like in&s;truction, or a &s;entence which ought to be remembered.</P>
<P>From a Stage, in &s;uch a &s;tate, it is time to with|draw; but I call on my younger cotemporaries, I in|voke the ri&s;ing generation, to <HI>correct</HI> a ta&s;te which, to be gratified, demands neither genius or intellect;&mdash; which a&s;ks only a happy knack at inventing TRICK. I adjure them to re&s;tore to the Drama SENSE, OBSER|VATION,
<PB N="xi" REF="8">
WIT, LESSON! and to teach our Writers to re&s;pect their own talents.</P>
<P>What mother can now lead her daughters to the great National School, THE THEATRE, in the confi|dence of their receiving either poli&s;h or improvement? Should the luckle&s;s Bard &s;tumble on a reflection, or a &s;entiment, the audience yawn, and wait for the next tumble from a chair, or a tripping up of the heels, to put them into attention. Surely I &s;hall be forgiven for &s;atiri&s;ing my&s;elf; I have <HI>made</HI> &s;uch things, and I blu&s;h to have made them.</P>
<P>O! GENIUS of a poli&s;h'd age, de&s;cend!&mdash;plant thy banners in our Theatres, and bid ELEGANCE and FEEL|ING take place of the <HI>droll</HI> and the <HI>laugh,</HI> which formerly were found only in the Booths of <HI>Bartlemy</HI> Fair, and were divided between <HI>Flocton</HI> and <HI>Yates!</HI> With actors capable of giving force to all that is intellectual, is it not <HI>pity</HI> to condemn them to &s;uch drudgery? THEY are no longer nece&s;&s;ary. Let Sadler's Wells and the Circus empty them&s;elves of their performers to furni&s;h our Stage; the expence to Managers will be le&s;s, and their bu&s;ine&s;s will be carried on better. The UNDERSTANDING, DISCERNMENT, and EDUCATION, which di&s;tingui&s;h our modern actors, are u&s;ele&s;s to them;&mdash;&s;trong mu&s;cles are in greater repute, and grimace has more powerful attraction.</P>

<L>AH! ah! you're here, and comfortably tight?</L>
<L>Well &s;queez'd and pre&s;s'd, I &s;ee&mdash;from left to right.</L>
<L>Waiting the moment when the curtain ri&s;es,</L>

<L>Were I a Poet&mdash;a Dramatic Wit,</L>

<L>Hint a loo&s;e outline of the &s;cene within,</L>
<L>And let you gue&s;s the whole ere we begin.</L>
<L>In pre&s;ent times, the Prologue and its Play,</L>

<L>Confin'd, then, not to &s;ay a word of <HI>that,</HI></L>
<L>I'll tell a &s;tory&mdash;and I have one pat.</L>

<L>A Boniface of late, placed near his door,</L>
<L>"Good larders here, of genuine wines, rich &s;tore."</L>
<L>In gold the gaudy invitation hung,</L>
<L>And to the &s;hifting Zephyrs gently &s;wung.</L>
<L>It chanc'd a traveller, with &s;tomach keen,</L>
<L>Leapt from his Rozinante, tir'd and lean,</L>
<L>'Talk'd of his &s;upper, with an eager air&mdash;</L>
<L>Re&s;olved, for once, in no expence to &s;pare;</L>
<L>I'll have &s;tewed carp, he cried, and chicken roa&s;t.</L>
<L>And, bring me, of the Burgundy you boa&s;t.</L>
<L>Y&mdash;e&mdash;s, Sir, the &s;taring, curtfying Dam&s;el &s;aid,</L>
<L>And, in a trice, the table-cloth was laid.</L>
<L>I am my own man, he adds, in accents bold,</L>
<L><PB REF="10">Nor &s;hall I fear, to-night, my hou&s;ehold &s;cold;</L>
<L>One hundred miles, betwixt me and my dear&mdash;</L>
<L>Odds bobs! her &s;hrill alarum can't reach here!</L>
<L>At length came back the pretty, &s;impering Kate,</L>
<L>And plac'd&mdash;two eggs upon his lonely plate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our Traveller amazed, the Landlord call'd,</L>
<L>Ho&s;t! Ho&s;t! in angry accents loudly bawl'd;</L>
<L>He came&mdash;Where are your ducks, your lob&s;ters, turkey, hare?</L>
<L>"Why, there you have them&mdash;<HI>in the Bill of Fare</HI>;</L>
<L>"There you have game, and fowl, and fi&s;h, well dre&s;t,</L>

<L>"My hou&s;e affords no other, Sir, believe me,</L>

<L>The gue&s;t fatigued, enraged, the Inn for&s;ook,</L>
<L>And the road, &s;lowly, to another took:</L>
<L>There, <HI>without</HI> promi&s;e, all was neat and clean,</L>
<L>His food was whole&s;ome, and his room not mean.</L>
<L>So&mdash;not to rai&s;e high hopes, we cannot meet,</L>
<L>We tru&s;t this night's <HI>plain</HI> fare is fre&s;h and &s;weet;</L>
<L>And &s;hou'd you like the dre&s;&s;ing, we invite ye,</L>

<P>What, Madam, do you doubt my knowledge of Greek! Some people can hardly read Engli&s;h at &s;ight; I can tran&s;late at &s;ight, thanks to the milk I &s;uck'd in at Oxford.

<P>Come, come, Mr. Fancourt, your extravagancies have rendered you poor, and therefore you are always raving thus, and pouring your philipics on people of fortune;&mdash;as though vice and folly could only be found in palaces, and virtue in garrets.</P>

<P>For my part, I believe there is as much goodne&s;s among&s;t per&s;ons of fortune, as among&s;t the poor&mdash;and I do not &s;ee why the power of dre&s;&s;ing elegantly, and living in well educated &s;ociety, &s;hould deba&s;e the heart, or weaken the under&s;tanding.</P>
