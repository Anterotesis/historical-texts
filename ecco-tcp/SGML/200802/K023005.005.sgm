<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Find a Rebuke in a late Letter of yours that both &s;tings and plea&s;es me extreamly. Your &s;aying that I ought to have writ a Po&s;t&s;cript to my Friend GAY's, makes me not content to write le&s;s than a whole Letter; and your &s;eeming to
<PB N="2" REF="6">
take his kindly, gives me Hopes you will look upon this as a &s;incere Effect of Friend&s;hip: Indeed, as I cannot but own the Lazine&s;s with which you tax me, and with which I may equally charge you, for both of us have had (and one of us has both had and given) a Sur|feit of Writing, &s;o I really thought you would know your&s;elf to be &s;o cer|tainly intitled to my Friend&s;hip, that it was a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion you could not ima|gine needed any farther Deeds or Writings to a&s;&s;ure you of it.</P>
<P>It is an hone&s;t Truth, there is no one living or dead of whom I think oftner or better than your&s;elf. I look upon you to be (as to me) in a State between both; you have from me, all the Pa&s;&s;ions and good Wi&s;hes that can attend the Living, and all that Re&s;pect and tender Sen&s;e of Lo&s;s that we feel for the Dead. Whatever you &s;eem to think of your withdrawn and &s;eparate State, at this Di&s;tance, and
<PB N="3" REF="7">
in this Ab&s;ence, Dean SWIFT lives &s;till in <HI>England,</HI> in every Place and Com|pany where he would chu&s;e to live, and I find him in all the Conver&s;ations I keep, and in all the Hearts, in which I would have any Share.</P>
<P>We have never met the&s;e many Years without mention of you; be&s;ides my old Acquaintance, I have found that all my Friends of a later Date, are &s;uch as were yours before. Lord OXFORD, Lord HARCOURT, and Lord HARLEY, may look upon me as one intailed upon them by you. Lord BOLING|BROKE is now returned (as I hope) to take me with all his other Heredi|tary-Rights; and, indeed, he &s;eems grown &s;o much a Philo&s;opher, as to &s;et his Heart upon &s;ome of them as little, as upon the Poet you gave him. It is &s;ure my ill Fate, that all tho&s;e I mo&s;t loved, and with whom I have mo&s;t lived, mu&s;t be Bani&s;hed! after both of you left <HI>England,</HI> my con&s;tant
<PB N="4" REF="8">
Ho&s;t was the Bi&s;hop of ROCHESTER; &s;ure this is a Nation that is cur&s;edly afraid of being over-run with too much Politene&s;s, and cannot regain one great Genius, but at the Expence of ano|ther: I tremble for my Lord PETERBO|ROW (whom I now lodge with) he has too much Wit, as well as Courage, to make a &s;olid General; and if he e&s;capes being Bani&s;hed by others, I fear he will Bani&s;h him&s;elf. This leads me to give you &s;ome Account of my Manner of Life and Conver&s;ation, which has been infinitely more various and di&s;&s;i|pated, than when you knew me and cared for me; and among all Sexes, Parties, and Profe&s;&s;ions, a Glut of Stu|dy and Retirement, in the fir&s;t Part of my Life, ca&s;t me into This; and This I begin to &s;ee will throw me again into Study and Retirement.</P>
<P>The Civilities I have met with from oppo&s;ite Sets of People, have hindred me from being violent or &s;our to any
<PB N="5" REF="9">
Party; but at the &s;ame time the Ob|&s;ervations and Experiences I cannot but have collected, have made me le&s;s fond of, and le&s;s &s;urprized at, any; I am there|fore the more afflicted and the more angry at the Violences and Hard&s;hips I &s;ee practi&s;ed by either. The Merry Vein you knew me in, is &s;unk into a Turn of Reflection, that has made the World pretty indifferent to me, and yet I have acquired a Quietne&s;s of Mind which by Fits improves into a certain degree of Chearfulne&s;s, enough to make me ju&s;t &s;o good humoured as to wi&s;h That World well: My Friend&s;hips are in|crea&s;ed by new ones, yet no part of the Warmth I felt for the old is dimi|ni&s;hed: Aver&s;ions I have none but to Knaves (for Fools I have learned to bear with) and tho&s;e I cannot be commonly civil to, for I think tho&s;e next to Knaves who conver&s;e with them; the greate&s;t Man in Power, of this Sort, &s;hall hardly make me Bow to him, un|le&s;s I had a per&s;onal Obligation to him,
<PB N="6" REF="10">
and that I will take care not to have. The top Plea&s;ure of my Life is one I learned from you, both how to gain and how to u&s;e the Freedoms of Friend&s;hip with Men much my Supe|riors. To have plea&s;ed great Men, ac|cording to <HI>Horace,</HI> is a Prai&s;e; but not to have flattered them, and yet not to have di&s;plea&s;ed, is a greater. I have carefully avoided all Intercour&s;e with Poets and Scriblers, unle&s;s where by chance I have found a Mode&s;t one; by the&s;e Means I have had no Quarrels with any per&s;onally; and none have been Enemies, but who were al|&s;o Strangers to me; and as there is no great need of an Ecclairci&s;ment with &s;uch, whatever they writ or &s;aid I ne|ver related, not only never &s;eeming to know, but often really never knowing any thing of the Matter: There are very few Things that give me the Anxiety of a Wi&s;h; the &s;tronge&s;t I have, would be to pa&s;s my Days with you; and a few &s;uch as you: But Fate
<PB N="7" REF="11">
has di&s;per&s;ed them all about the World, and I find to wi&s;h it, is as vain, as to wi&s;h to live to &s;ee the <HI>Millenium,</HI> and the Kingdom of the Ju&s;t upon Earth.</P>
<P>If I have &s;inned in my long Silence, con&s;ider there is one to whom you your&s;elf have been as great a Sinner; as often as you &s;ee his Hand you will learn to do me Ju&s;tice, and feel in your Heart, how long a Man may be &s;ilent to tho&s;e he truly loves and re|&s;pects.</P>

<P>I Am not &s;o lazy as POPE, and there|fore you mu&s;t not expect from me the &s;ame indulgence to Lazine&s;s; in defending his own Cau&s;e he pleads yours; and becomes your Advocate while he appeals to you as his Judge; you will do the &s;ame on your Part; and I, and the re&s;t of your common Friends, &s;hall have great Ju&s;tice to expect from two &s;uch righteous Tribunals: You re&s;emble perfectly the two Alehou&s;e-Keepers in <HI>Holland,</HI> who were at the

&s;ame time Burgoma&s;ters of the Town, and taxed one another's Bills alter|nately. I declare before hand I will not &s;tand to the Award; my Title to your Friend&s;hip is good, and wants neither Deeds nor Writings to confirm it; but Annual-Acknowledgments at lea&s;t are nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve it; and I begin to &s;u&s;pect by your defrauding me of them, that you hope in time to di&s;pute it, and to urge Pre&s;cription again&s;t me. I would not &s;ay one Word to you about my&s;elf (&s;ince it is a Sub|ject on which you appear to have no Curio&s;ity) was it not to try, how far the Contra&s;t between POPE's Fortune and Manner of Life, and Mine may be carried.</P>
<P>I have been then infinitely more uni|form and le&s;s di&s;&s;ipated, than when you knew me and cared for me; that Love which I u&s;ed to &s;catter with &s;ome Profu|&s;ion, among the whole Female Kind, has been the&s;e many Years devoted to One
<PB N="10" REF="15">
Object; a great many Misfortunes (for &s;o they are called, though &s;ometimes very improperly) and a Retirement from the World, have made that ju&s;t and nice Di&s;crimination between my Ac|quaintance and my Friends, which we have &s;eldom Sagacity enough to make for Our&s;elves; tho&s;e In&s;ects of various Hues, which u&s;ed to hum and buz about me while I &s;tood in the Sun|&s;hine, have di&s;appeared &s;ince I lived in the Shade. No Man comes to a Her|mitage but for the Sake of the Hermit; a few Philo&s;ophical Friends come often to mine, and they are &s;uch as you would be glad to live with, if a dull Climate and duller Company have not altered you extreamly from what you was nine Years ago.</P>
<P>The hoar&s;e Voice of Party was never heard in this quiet Place<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">DAWLEY.</NOTE>; Gazettes and Pamphlets are bani&s;hed from it, and if the Lucubrations of ISAAC
<PB N="11" REF="16">
BICKERSTAFF are admitted, this Di&s;|tinction is owing to &s;ome Strokes by which it is judged that this illu&s;trious Philo&s;opher, had (like the <HI>Indian</HI> FOHU, the <HI>Grecian</HI> PYTHAGORAS, the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> ZOROASTER, and others his Precur&s;ors among the <HI>Arabians, Magians,</HI> and the <HI>Egyptian</HI> SERES) both his Outward and his Inward Doctrine, and that he was of no Side at the Bottom&mdash;When I am there, I forget I was ever of any Party my&s;elf; nay, I am of|ten &s;o happily ab&s;orbed by the ab&s;tract|ed Rea&s;on of Things, that I am ready to imagine there never was any &s;uch Mon&s;ter as Party. Alas, I am &s;oon awakened from that plea&s;ing Dream by the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;torians, by GUICCIARDIN, by MACHIAVEL, and by THUANUS; for I have vowed to read no Hi&s;tory of Our own Country, till that Body of it which you pro|mi&s;e to fini&s;h appears.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="17">
I am under no apprehen&s;ions that a Glut of Study and Retirement &s;hould ca&s;t me back into the Hurry of the World; on the contrary, the &s;ingle Regret which I ever feel, is that I fell &s;o late into this Cour&s;e of Life: My Philo&s;ophy grows confirmed by Habit, and if you and I meet again I will extort this Approbation from you, I am <HI>con&s;ilio bonus, &s;ed more eo produc|tus, ut non tantum recte facere po&s;&s;im, &s;ed nil non recte facere non po&s;&s;im.</HI> The little Incivilities I have met with from oppo&s;ite Sets of People, have been &s;o far from rendring me violent or &s;our to any, that I think my&s;elf obliged to them all; &s;ome have cured me of my Fears, by &s;hewing me how impotent the Malice of the World is; others have cured me of my Hopes, by &s;hew|ing how precarious popular Friend|&s;hips are; all have cured me of Sur|prize; in driving me out of Party, they have driven me out of cur&s;ed
<PB N="13" REF="18">
Company; and in &s;tripping me of Ti|tles, and Rank, and E&s;tate, and &s;uch Trinkets, which every Man that will may &s;pare, they have given me that which no Man can be happy without.</P>
<P>Reflection and Habit have rendred the World &s;o indifferent to me, that I am neither afflicted nor rejoiced, angry nor plea&s;ed at what happens in it, any farther than per&s;onal Friend&s;hips inte|re&s;t me in the Affairs of it, and this Principle extends my Cares but a little Way: Perfect Tranquility is the gene|ral Tenour of my Life; good Dige&s;|tions, &s;erene Weather, and &s;ome other mechanic Springs, wind me above it now and then, but I never fall below it; I am &s;ometimes gay, but I am never &s;ad; I have gained New Friends, and have lo&s;t &s;ome Old ones; my Acqui&s;itions of this kind give me a good deal of Plea|&s;ure, becau&s;e they have not been made lightly: I know no Vows &s;o &s;olemn as tho&s;e of Friend&s;hip, and therefore a
<PB N="14" REF="19">
pretty long noviciate of Acquaintance &s;hould methinks precede them; my Lo&s;&s;es of this kind give me but little Trouble, I contributed nothing to them, and a Friend who breaks with me un|ju&s;tly is not worth pre&s;erving. As &s;oon as I leave this Town (which will be in a few Days) I &s;hall fall back into that Cour&s;e of Life, which keeps Knaves and Fools at a great di&s;tance from me; I have an Aver&s;ion to them Both, but in the ordinary Cour&s;e of Life I think I can bear the &s;en&s;ible Knave better than the Fool: One mu&s;t indeed with the former be in &s;ome, or other, of the At|titudes of tho&s;e Wooden Men whom I have &s;een before a Sword-Cutler's Shop in <HI>Germany,</HI> but even in the&s;e con|&s;trained Po&s;tures the witty Ra&s;cal will divert me; and he that diverts me does me a great deal of good, and lays me under an Obligation to him, which I am not obliged to pay him in another Coin: The Fool obliges me to be almo&s;t as much upon my Guard as the Knave,
<PB N="15" REF="20">
and he makes me no amends; he numbs me like the Torpor, or he teizes me like the Fly. This is the Picture of an old Friend, and more like him than that will be which you once asked, and which he will &s;end you, if you continue &s;till to de&s;ire it&mdash;Adieu, dear SWIFT with all thy Faults I love Thee intirely, make an Effort, and love me on with all mine.</P>

I an&s;wer in the Negative; which I &s;hall confirm by the following Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>The Reputation a Poet obtains from the public Applau&s;e, is not altogether imaginary; for the Number of tho&s;e who are not influenced by it, is &s;o very &s;mall, that he is out of fear of Dan|ger from them. Nay, tho&s;e very Men,
<PB N="36" REF="41">
who on a private Peru&s;al of &s;ome Plays, entertained but an indifferent Opinion of them, fondly debauched by their Succe&s;s, run their Approbation up to Bigotry; never reflecting that as a Man's Name often &s;ub&s;erves to his pub|lic Reception, without regard to his Performance; &s;o the Gracefulne&s;s of the Action, and the Pomp of the Theatre, joined to the injudicious Claps of the Audience, as often give the greate&s;t Applau&s;e to the wor&s;t Plays; and for a while pre&s;erve the general E&s;teem of the Town. For when once a Play has got That on its Side, a great many Men of Sen&s;e rather &s;wim down than &s;tem the Tide, or oppo&s;e the Vogue at the Expence of the Imputa|tion of Singularity. This is evident from &s;ome late Plays (I had almo&s;t &s;aid Farces) again&s;t which the be&s;t Critics declared in vain.</P>
<P>But before the Action, a moderate Character of a Play, from a Man of
<PB N="37" REF="42">
tolerable Sen&s;e, &s;hall by his par&s;imo|nious Prai&s;e, damn it, tho' ever &s;o meritorious; for the Judgment of the Audience being not yet pa&s;t in its Fa|vour, the Town is ready to take the fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ions from any Man, who&s;e plau&s;ible A&s;&s;urance has got him the Reputation of a Critic; becau&s;e Peo|ple hope by falling in with his Cen&s;ure, to give a &s;ufficient Proof of their Un|der&s;tandings. A Poet therefore in &s;ub|mitting his Play, before Action, to a Peru&s;al, runs as many hazards, as he confides it to Men who want either Candour or Judgment; and among tho&s;e that the vulgar Voice has allowed Wits, a Man with &s;uch Qualifications is not very ea&s;y to be found. One of the&s;e Wits always over-values him&s;elf; and believing that he is Ma&s;ter of a great deal of Sen&s;e, when his <HI>Portion,</HI> perhaps, but ju&s;t <HI>&s;ea&s;ons</HI> him from <HI>Fool;</HI> and &s;o only fini&s;hes a <HI>Coxcomb,</HI> who thinks the only way to e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf a Wit, is by finding Fault.
<PB N="38" REF="43">
And the Town, which is not over-nice, in di&s;tingui&s;hing betwixt Merit and Pre|tence, is often impo&s;ed on by the Cox|comb, it mi&s;takes for a Man of Sen&s;e; and bya&s;&s;ed by the general Malice of Mankind (that inclines mo&s;t Men ra|ther to believe Ill than Good of ano|ther) it &s;trikes in with his injudicious as well as unju&s;t Cen&s;ures.</P>
<P>There is another &s;ort of <HI>Wits</HI> (though of &s;omewhat a higher Cla&s;s) whom a &s;mall Stock of Learning, and the Flattery of &s;ome of their Ac|quaintance, has confirmed in the Self|opinion of being good Critics, and with the&s;e the Poet yet runs a greater Ri&s;que; for it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e them with any thing Modern, except their Own. The&s;e Critics have a very contemptible Opinion of the Age they live in, and think Fortune extremely &s;evere in not ca&s;ting them into the Times of <HI>Euripi|des, Horace,</HI> or it may be <HI>Shake&s;peare;</HI> and they are angry with Providence for

planting them &s;o far <HI>Northward,</HI> who might have made a Figure in a more <HI>Southerly</HI> Clime, among the fir&s;t-Rate Wits of old <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Italy.</HI> They think &s;o meanly of all they know, that they would &s;ooner admire a Scribler they never &s;aw, than a Man of the be&s;t Sen&s;e of their own Acquaintance. They cen&s;ure the Wit by the Counte|nance; and the Man who&s;e <HI>Face</HI> they are di&s;gu&s;ted with, mu&s;t never hope to plea&s;e them with his <HI>Under&s;tanding.</HI> If ever they happen to think well of any Man's Wit for a while, (for their good Opinion of any one is of a very &s;hort duration) it is when they meet with one as ill-natured and vain as them&s;elves; then their Spleen at the Merits of others, being gratified with Railing, blinds them to a Momen|tary Satisfaction in the Defamer; but that being over, their native Pride re|turns, and they look down on him too; for all their Talent and Time is expended in &s;peaking well of them|&s;elves

and their own Writings, and ill of every body el&s;e: But then theW orld is often even with them, for they gene|rally are plea&s;ed with them&s;elves with|out a Rival.</P>
<P>Indeed, there is often a Magi&s;terial Pride and ill Nature in Men of a great deal of Wit and Learning, which al|mo&s;t overthrows all their Merit, or at lea&s;t makes one angry to find things &s;o valuable in &s;uch ill Hands; for when Prai&s;e, or Succe&s;s, has once debauched a Man's Judgment into <HI>Opiniatre,</HI> he is but a Fool of his own making, ten times more intolerable than a Fool of God's making.</P>
<P>Again, there are &s;ome who are but lately e&s;tabli&s;hed Wits by a lucky Hit, and hope to keep up that Character by depre&s;&s;ing others, or damning what they write, with faint and affected Prai&s;e. The&s;e are for keeping Fame <HI>Cha&s;te,</HI> (though them&s;elves are an In|&s;tance
<PB N="41" REF="46">
of her <HI>Pro&s;titution</HI>) that is, for their own u&s;e only; never reflecting, that &s;he, like tho&s;e of who&s;e Sex &s;he is painted, is capable of &s;atisfying more than One; nay, that like a pretty Wo|man, it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to keep her to one's &s;elf. The&s;e particularly avoid, for their recent Succe&s;s makes their Pride more lively, and their Ap|prehen&s;ion of any Rival more &s;trong.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI>'s Couplet reaches abundance of our current Wits, or Critics.<Q><L>Tho&s;e who write ill, and tho&s;e who ne'er dur&s;t write,</L>
<L>Turn Critics out of meer Revenge and Spite.</L></Q></P>
<P>Yet all the&s;e have it in their Power, to do a great deal of Mi&s;chief to a Poet who is &s;o bold, as to venture his Reputation in their Hands; becau&s;e the undi&s;cerning Town never reflects, that as a <HI>Critic</HI> is the la&s;t Refuge of a Pretender to Wit, &s;o he that is full only of the Faults of an Author, is
<PB N="42" REF="47">
le&s;s de&s;erving, even of that Name, than he who &s;ometimes ri&s;es up to a Ta&s;te of his Excellencies. Nor does the Town con&s;ider, that a great many Men have no other way of keeping within the Pale of <HI>Wit,</HI> but by excluding tho&s;e who are only capable of ex|cluding them.</P>
<P>There are another &s;ort of Men who pa&s;s for Wits with the Town, that are far from being &s;o; and the&s;e are your <HI>Laughers, merry Rogues,</HI> who have a mortal Aver&s;ion to Thought; and as they laugh at every Thing, even what they &s;ay them&s;elves, it is not to be ex|pected they &s;hould &s;pare the mo&s;t &s;e|rious Performance.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> The Judgment mo&s;t Men make of Books, is generally very erro|neous in judging the Performance by the Author, not the Author by the Performance; if a Man, through In|experience, or any accidental Misfor|tune,
<PB N="43" REF="48">
have the ill luck not to plea&s;e in one thing, &s;ome will by no means al|low him a Capacity of plea&s;ing at all. Though Mr. <HI>Dryden,</HI> Mr. <HI>Wycherley,</HI> Mr. <HI>Otway,</HI> and every eminent Poet, have been Proofs of the contrary; while &s;ome, &s;ucce&s;sful to a Wonder, in their fir&s;t Attempts, have mouldred away, and dwindled in a little time to le&s;s than the Shadow of tho&s;e mighty Men their fir&s;t &s;etting-out promi&s;ed. And, indeed, popular Applau&s;e is too common a Te&s;t of the Writer's Merit, of which the be&s;t Poets have com|plained both in <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome. Pe|tronius Arbiter,</HI> in the Per&s;on of <HI>Eu|molpus,</HI> gives it as an Ob&s;ervation in his Time.</P>

<P>I Have now pa&s;&s;ed a Winter and a Summer here; the latter is much the be&s;t. I was &s;o contracted together in the Winter, that I was, in a manner, Dead with Cold, and fit for nothing but to be Di&s;&s;ected. Often am I put in Mind of the wide difference between <HI>Peter&s;burg,</HI> and old <HI>England,</HI> not only on Account of its Coldne&s;s, but Un|politene&s;s; for I well remember how my Dear <HI>Mamma</HI> u&s;ed to give Orders to our Servants to keep a thorough Silence in the Hou&s;e till I was awake in a Mor|ning, and when that News was brought her, with what an endearing tenderne&s;s did &s;he enquire after my Health? But
<PB N="47" REF="52">
here the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Bear-Brutes with their Heels and their Tongues, make as loud a Din up and down Stairs, before we are &s;tirring, as there is at Drury Lane after the Play is over. Such is the &s;er|vile Politene&s;s of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia.</HI> However, I ble&s;s God I have my Health, and am &s;en&s;ible it will be a &s;ecret Plea&s;ure, to you to hear of my Welfare; and I mu&s;t declare that I am as happily &s;itua|ted as you could wi&s;h me, and am u&s;ed intirely to my own Satisfaction. For my part, under Misfortunes, I &s;hall always advi&s;e Travelling, it being plea&s;urable to attempt the mo&s;t di&s;tant Part of the Globe with a Re&s;olution and Tru&s;t in the <HI>Divine Providence</HI> which never fails tho&s;e who rely on it. This I offer exclu&s;ive of <HI>Prede&s;tination</HI> and all Fanatic Cant. When in our Voyage, the Captain told me we &s;hould that Night go through the Gulph; me|thought he little knew how great a One I had &s;hot, when I left <HI>England</HI> to &s;ail Three-thou&s;and-miles with only a

I &s;hall therefore mo&s;t gratefully acknowledge, that to you, it is, I owe my pre&s;ent Happine&s;s, and am your much obliged Friend, and humble Servant,</P>

<P>BE plea&s;ed now, to take an Account of this Place from above fifteen Months Experience.</P>
<P>The Gentleman and Lady<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mrs. JUSTICE went over as a <HI>Governe&s;s</HI> to &s;ome young <HI>La|dies;</HI> obliged thereto, by the di&s;honourable Practice of her Hu&s;band, lately Tran&s;ported for Robbing the Libraries at <HI>Cambridge.</HI> She was the Daughter of an eminent Phy&s;ician, in <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> and brought Mr. JUSTICE a very hand&s;ome Fortune. He has had by Her Three Children, which are kept by his own Mother, a wor|thy Gentlewoman, now living in the City of <HI>York.</HI></NOTE> I am with, have u&s;ed me with the greate&s;t
<PB N="49" REF="54">
Tenderne&s;s, Humanity and Politene&s;s that is po&s;&s;ible. He is Ju&s;t, Generous, and Obliging. She is Virtuous, Chari|table and Compa&s;&s;ionate; and I do from my Heart &s;ay, They are the Per&s;ons to whom I am, and wi&s;h to be obliged.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Climate it is ex|tream Cold, as you may imagine when Eighteen Thou&s;and Men were lately Reviewed upon the Ice. Carriages of all Sorts, laden with Goods, are every Day drawn over it. But indulgent Hea|ven to make up this Severity, has given plenty of Wood, and Furs, to fence again&s;t the Cold.</P>
<P>The People are very Strong, and can endure great Hard&s;hip. As to their Beauty, I cannot &s;ay, in Painting, they would make very &s;oft Pieces; for the Lines of their Faces are very Strong. They are mo&s;t of them of a good Heighth, but the Men wear very long
<PB N="50" REF="55">
Beards. The Ladies are, or can be, ju&s;t what you plea&s;e. For, only &s;ay, what Complexion you like, and they will in&s;tantly put it on; being well ver&s;ed in Painting.</P>
<P>As to their Conver&s;ation I will not &s;ay any thing of it, not under&s;tanding their Language, but they Bow very much, and are Civil to Strangers. They can di&s;pence with more Dirt, and much more Food, than the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>Their Churches are finely Adorned with what they call GODS. They go to Church in the Night, and He who makes the lowe&s;t Bow is mo&s;t Religious.</P>
<P>As to their Servants, they are the mo&s;t ignorant Creatures living, and have every thing which attends Igno|rance, that is, Ingratitude, Dirt and Saucine&s;s; and are, in my Opinion, far inferiour to a well taught Bear.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="56">
Their Buildings are very Magnificent, and their Hou&s;es are very Warm, having an Oven in every Room, to which I creep clo&s;e.</P>
<P>The Diver&s;ions of the Place are the&s;e; Twice a Week an Opera, and now and then, a &s;erious Game at Ombre for what will never hurt any Body, Love and Friend&s;hip; and on a Moon-Light Night, a Tour upon the Ice in a Sled.</P>
<P>As to Scandal, here is enough of it; but, the Gentlemen Rival the Ladies of the Talent always allowed them, of a little Tittle-Tattle.</P>
<P>Here is no occa&s;ion for Sir <HI>Clement Cotterel,</HI> for they are much upon the <HI>Sans Ceremonie.</HI> There is one thing that I believe they exceed any Part of the World in, <HI>Illuminations;</HI> which they make about Four or Five times a Year, and the Expence is above Sixty
<PB N="52" REF="57">
&s;and Pounds a Year, and in my Opi|nion it is well worth it.</P>
<P>As to Provi&s;ions, here is every thing very good, and in great Plenty. As to Liquors, they are the &s;ame. As to Port Wine they wonder what it is; but <HI>French</HI> Wine, as <HI>Chatteau-Margouz, Burgundy, Tocai, Arrack,</HI> we every Night drink to all Friends in Old <HI>Eng|land.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;hort, here is no want of any thing but agreeable Company; and, except the Family I am in, there is not a Per&s;on that I &s;hould not think my Time as lo&s;t with, if I conver&s;ed with them. The Rules I go by are The&s;e; I think no One my Friend, and there|fore cannot be deceived. I hear All, and &s;ay Little. I keep my old Maxim of giving no Affront, nor will not tamely take one. I believe, from this time, I &s;hall always put into Lotteries; for I am apt to think my Luck is turn|ed,
<PB N="53" REF="58">
in happening to be &s;o fortunate as to come into &s;o worthy a Family.</P>
<P>I make no excu&s;e for this long Let|ter, it is in Compliance of your Re|que&s;t, and I de&s;ire your Acceptance of my Acknowledgments for all Favours conferred on,</P>

<P>I Intreat your Acceptance of a <HI>Win|ter-Piece.</HI> The Scene of this Coun|try is quite changed. The agreeable River which ran by my Window, is now con&s;olidated into a fixt Sub&s;tance of Ice. I daily &s;ee Numbers of Car|riages
<PB N="54" REF="59">
riages covered with Snow, and the Men's Beards look as if they were &s;et with Diamonds by the I&s;icles hanging about them. The Green Trees are be|come &s;o White, that they put me in mind of the Ro&s;emary upon Cakes at Twelfth-Tide; and the Gentlemen and Ladies, I think, are turned into diffe|rent Creatures, of all Sorts, by their Dre&s;s, being habited in Skins of divers Bea&s;ts. Yet, notwith&s;tanding the Se|verity of the Fro&s;t, the Hou&s;es are kept warm by Ovens, as I ob&s;erved in my former; they give an equal Heat, but are not to me &s;o agreeable as <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fires, wherein, I think, is a kind of Cheerfulne&s;s that I prefer to this Me|thod.</P>
<P>The Diet of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> is excellently good, and, in my Opinion, this Place is very fit for an Epicure; for in &s;hort, Eating and Drinking take up a third Part of their Time.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="60">
Retirement is my Delight; and when my little Ladies and I are together, I want no other Company nor Employ|ment; when I have a lei&s;ure Hour to my Self, I &s;pend it in Reading.</P>
<P>All the News I can &s;end you, is, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Re&s;ident gave a very ele|gant Entertainment on the King's Birth-Day, which concluded with a Ball. I was not at it, for my Dre&s;s is &s;till Brown Camlet, and I think that be&s;t for Re|tirement: I make up the Di&s;appoint|ment of Fea&s;ts, by attending a very polite Entertainment, that is, in Read|ing the <HI>Spectator.</HI> For, I really think I am now arrived to that Happine&s;s he &s;o agreeably repre&s;ents of being <HI>lea&s;t Alone, when quite Alone;</HI> on which I put this Con&s;truction, that <HI>Books are the be&s;t Companions.</HI> Pardon my Prolixity; but as I am of the Sex who &s;eldom are Conci&s;e, I intreat you to put on your

<P>THE Favours you have formerly be&s;towed on me are what I can never forget, I therefore omit no Op|portunity of acknowledging Them.</P>
<P>Was I not convinced of your real Me|rit I would not venture to write this, for I believe I have now wrote Ten Let|ters and have had no An&s;wer. My Friends are equally unkind. I mu&s;t own, that One Letter I have been fa|voured with from you affords me much Satisfaction, for I have the Vanity to believe you mean what you &s;ay. I think I may be allowed to complain, when my Si&s;ter cannot find time to

write once a Year to unhappy me. But bad News never wants for car|rying, for there is a Gentleman in <HI>England</HI> who has wrote to his Cor|re&s;pondent here, that Mr. JUSTICE is the Per&s;on who is under Confinement, and charged with the Robbery of the Library at <HI>Cambridge:</HI> This News ar|rived about Four Months ago, but my Ma&s;ter and Lady concealed it from me, as they do every thing that they think will give me any unea&s;ine&s;s; yet not|with&s;tanding their Care it came to my Ear, and that in a very abrupt Manner. I was from the unwelcome News much di&s;ordered and not willing to believe it true, but there was in Three News Pa|pers, immediately following, &s;ome Cir|cum&s;tances that agreed with it; now I will leave you to judge what an Anxi|ety of Mind I mu&s;t be in, not having any one Friend &s;o generous as to inform me of &s;o important an Affair.

<P>_REturning from a &s;ummer expedition of four months on account of my health, I found a letter from you, with an appendix longer than yours, from Lord Bo|lingbroke. I believe there is not a more mi&s;erable malady than an unwillingne&s;s to write letters to our be&s;t friends, and a man might be philo&s;opher enough in finding out rea&s;ons for it; one thing is clear, that it &s;hews a mighty difference betwixt Friend|&s;hip
<PB N="66" REF="73">
and Love, for a lover (as I have heard) is always &s;cribling to his mi&s;tre&s;s. If I could permit my &s;elf to believe what your civility makes you &s;ay, that I am &s;till remembred by my friends in England, I am in the right to keep my &s;elf here&mdash;<HI>Non &s;um qualis eram.</HI> I left you in a period of life when one year does more execution than three at yours, to which if you add the dul|ne&s;s of the air, and of the people, it will make a terrible &s;um. I have no very &s;trong faith in you pretenders to Retirement, you are not of an age for it, nor have gone through either good or bad fortune enough, to go into a corner, and form conclu&s;ions <HI>de contemptu mundi &amp; fuga &s;aeculi,</HI> unle&s;s a Poet grows weary of too much applau&s;e, as Mini&s;ters do of too much weight of bu|&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Your Happine&s;s is greater than your merit, in chu&s;ing your Favourites &s;o indifferently among either Party; this you owe partly to your Education; and partly to your Genius employing you in an Art in which Faction has nothing to do, for I &s;uppo&s;e Virgil and Horace are equally read by Whigs and To|ries. You have no more to do with the Con&s;titution of Church and State, than a Chri&s;tian at Con&s;tantinople; and you are &s;o much the wi&s;er and the happier, becau&s;e both Parties will approve your Poetry as long as you are known to be of neither.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="74">
Your notions of Friend&s;hip are new to me, I believe every man is born with his <HI>quantum,</HI> and he cannot give to one with|out robbing another. I very well know to whom I would give the fir&s;t place in my Friend&s;hip, but they are not in the way: I am condemned to another &s;cene, and therefore I di&s;tribute it in Penny-worths to tho&s;e about me, and who di&s;plea&s;e me lea&s;t; and &s;hould do the &s;ame to my fellow|pri&s;oners if I were condemned to a jayl. I can likewi&s;e tolerate Knaves much better than Fools, becau&s;e their knavery does me no hurt in the commerce I have with them, which however I own is more dangerous, tho' not &s;o trouble&s;ome, as that of fools. I have often endeavour'd to e&s;tabli&s;h a friend|&s;hip among all Men of Genius, and would fain have it done: they are &s;eldom above three or four Cotemporaries, and if they could be united, would drive the World be|fore them. I think it was &s;o among the Poets in the time of Augu&s;tus; but Envy, and Party, and Pride, have hinder'd it among us. I do not include the Subalterns, of which you are &s;eldom without a large Tribe: Under the name of Poets and Scrib|lers, I &s;uppo&s;e you mean the Fools you are content to &s;ee &s;ometimes, when they happen to be mode&s;t; which was not frequent among them while I was in the World.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="75">
I would de&s;cribe to you my way of liv|ing, if any method could be call'd &s;o in this Country. I chu&s;e my companions a|mong tho&s;e of lea&s;t con&s;equence and mo&s;t compliance: I read the mo&s;t trifling Books I can find, and whenever I write, it is upon the mo&s;t trifling &s;ubjects: But riding, walk|ing, and &s;leeping take up eighteen of the twenty four hours. I procra&s;tinate more than I did twenty years ago, and have &s;eve|ral things to fini&s;h which I put off to twenty years hence; <HI>Haec e&s;t vita Solutorum, &amp;c.</HI> I &s;end you the compliments of a friend of yours, who hath pa&s;&s;ed four months this &s;ummer with two grave acquaintance at his country hou&s;e without ever once going to Dublin, which is but eight Miles di&s;tant; yet when he returns to London, I will en|gage you &s;hall find him as deep in the Court of Reque&s;ts, the Park, the Opera and the Coffee-hou&s;e, as any man there. I am now with him for a few days.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t remember me with great af|fection to Dr Arbuthnot, Mr Congreve, and Gay&mdash;I think there are no more <HI>eodem tertio's</HI> between you and me, except Mr. Jervas to who&s;e hou&s;e I addre&s;s this, for want of knowing where you live; for it was not clear from your la&s;t whether you lodge with Lord Peterborow, or he with you?

<HEAD>Mr POPE to Dr SWIFT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>December 10, 1725.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Find my &s;elf the better acquainted with you for a long Ab&s;ence, as men are with them&s;elves for a long Affliction: Ab|&s;ence does but hold off a Friend to make one &s;ee him the more truly. I am infinitely more pleas'd to hear you are coming near us, than at any thing you &s;eem to think in my favour; an opinion which perhaps has been aggrandiz'd by the di&s;tance or dullne&s;s of Ireland (as objects look larger thro' a me|dium of Foggs), and yet I am infinitely pleas'd with that too. I am much the hap|pier for finding (a better thing than our wits) our judgments jump, in the notion that all Scriblers &s;hould be pa&s;t by in &s;ilence. To vindicate one's &s;elf again&s;t &s;uch na&s;ty &s;lander; is much as wi&s;e as it was in your country|man, when the people imputed a &s;tink to him, to prove the contrary by &s;howing his back&s;ide. So let Gildon and Philips re&s;t in peace! What Virgil had to do with Mae|vius, that he &s;hould wear him upon his &s;leeve to all eternity, I don't know. I've been the longer upon this, that I may pre|pare you for the reception both you and your works may po&s;&s;ibly meet in England.
<PB N="70" REF="77">
We your true acquaintance will look upon you as a good man, and love you; others will look upon you as a Wit, and hate you. So you know the wor&s;t; unle&s;s you are as vindicative as Virgil, or the afore&s;aid Hi|bernian.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h as warmly as you for an Ho&s;pital in which to lodge the De&s;pi&s;ers of the world; only I fear it would be fill'd wholly like Chel&s;ea, with maimed Soldiers, and &s;uch as had been di&s;abled in it's &s;ervice. I would rather have tho&s;e, that out of &s;uch generous principles, as you and I, de&s;pi&s;e it, fly in it's face, than retire from it. Not that I have much anger again&s;t the Great; my &s;pleen is at the Little rogues of it: It would vex one more to be knock'd on the head with a Pi&s;s-pot, than by a Thunder|bolt. As to great Oppre&s;&s;ors, they are like Kites or Eagles, one expects mi&s;chief from them, but to be &s;quirted to death (as poor Wycherley &s;aid to me on his death-bed) by Apothecaries Apprentices, by the under|&s;trappers of under-&s;ecretaries to &s;ecretaries who were no &s;ecretaries&mdash;this would provoke as dull a dog as Philips him&s;elf.</P>
<P>So much for enemies, now for friends. Mr L&mdash; thinks all this indi&s;creet: the Doctor not &s;o: he loves mi&s;chief the be&s;t of any good natur'd man in England. Lord B. is above trifling: when he writes of any thing in this world, he is more than mor|tal;
<PB N="71" REF="78">
If ever he trifles, it mu&s;t be when he turns a Divine. Gay is writing Tales for Prince William: I &s;uppo&s;e Mr Philips will take this very ill, for two rea&s;ons; one that he thinks all childi&s;h things belong to him; and the other, becau&s;e he'll take it ill to be taught that one may write things to a child without being childi&s;h. What have I more to add? but that Lord Oxford de&s;ires ear|ne&s;tly to &s;ee you: and that many others whom you do not think the wor&s;t of will be gratified by it; none more (be a&s;&s;ured) than yours, &amp;c.</P>

<P>I Thank you for your letter, which has all tho&s;e genuine marks of a good mind by which I have ever di&s;tingui&s;h'd yours, and for which I have &s;o long loved you. Our friend&s;hip has been con&s;tant; becau&s;e it was grounded on good principles, and therefore not only uninterrupted by any Di&s;|tru&s;t, by any Vanity, much le&s;s any In|tere&s;t.</P>
<P>What you recommend to me with the &s;olemnity of a La&s;t Reque&s;t, &s;hall have it's due weight with me. That di&s;dain and indignation again&s;t Vice, is (I thank God)
<PB N="72" REF="79">
the only di&s;dain and indignation I have: It is &s;incere, and it will be a la&s;ting one. But &s;ure it is as impo&s;&s;ible to have a ju&s;t abhor|rence of Vice, without hating the Vicious, as to bear a true love for Virtue, without loving the Good. To reform and not to cha&s;ti&s;e, I am afraid is impo&s;&s;ible, and that the be&s;t Precepts, as well as the be&s;t Laws, would prove of &s;mall u&s;e, if there were no Examples to inforce them. To attack Vices in the ab&s;tract, without touching Per|&s;ons, may be &s;afe fighting indeed, but it is fighting with Shadows. General propo&s;i|tions are ob&s;cure, mi&s;ty, and uncertain, compar'd with plain, full, and home ex|amples: Precepts only apply to our Rea&s;on, which in mo&s;t men is but weak: Examples are pictures, and &s;trike the Sen&s;es, nay rai&s;e the Pa&s;&s;ions, and call in tho&s;e (the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t general of all motives) to the aid of reformation. Every vicious man makes the ca&s;e his own; and that is the only way by which &s;uch men can be affected, much le&s;s deterr'd. So that to cha&s;ti&s;e is to reform. The only &s;ign by which I found my writings ever did any good, or had any weight, has been that they rais'd the anger of bad men. And my greate&s;t comfort, and encouragement to proceed, has been to &s;ee, that tho&s;e who have no &s;hame, and no fear, of any thing el&s;e, have appear'd touch'd by my Satires.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="80">
As to your kind concern for my Safety, I can gue&s;s what occa&s;ions it at this time. Some Characters I have drawn are &s;uch, that if there be any who de&s;erve 'em, 'tis evi|dently a &s;ervice to mankind to point tho&s;e men out: yet &s;uch as if all the world gave them, none I think will own, they take to them&s;elves. But if they &s;hould, tho&s;e of whom all the world think in &s;uch a manner, mu&s;t be men I cannot fear. Such in par|ticular as have the meanne&s;s to do mi&s;chiefs in the dark, have &s;eldom the courage to ju&s;tify them in the face of day; the talents that make a Cheat or a Whi&s;perer, are not the &s;ame that qualify a man for an In&s;ul|ter; and as to private Villainy, it is not &s;o &s;afe to join in an A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, as in a Libel. I will con&s;ult my &s;afety to far as I think becomes a prudent man; but not &s;o far as to omit any thing which I think becomes an hone&s;t one. As to per&s;onal attacks beyond the law, every man is liable to them; as for danger within the law, I am not guilty enough to fear any. For the good opinion of all the world, I know it is not to be had: for that of worthy men, I hope I &s;hall not forfeit it; for that of the Great, or tho&s;e in power, I may wi&s;h I had it, but if thro' mi&s;repre&s;entations (too common about per&s;ons in that &s;tation) I have it not, I &s;hall be &s;orry, but not mi&s;erable in the want of it.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="81">
It is certain, much freer Satyri&s;ts than I, have enjoy'd the encouragement and pro|tection of the Princes under whom they lived. Augu&s;tus and Maecenas made Ho|race their companion, tho' he had been in arms on the &s;ide of Brutus; and allow me to remark it was out of the &s;uffering Party too, that they favour'd and di&s;tingui&s;h'd Virgil. You will not &s;u&s;pect me of com|paring my &s;elf with Virgil and Horace, nay even with another Court-favourite, Boileau: I have always been too mode&s;t to imagine my Panegyrics were Incen&s;e worthy of a Court; and that I hope will be thought the true rea&s;on why I have never offer'd any. I would only have ob&s;erv'd, that it was under the greate&s;t Princes and be&s;t Mi|ni&s;ters, that moral Satyri&s;ts were mo&s;t en|courag'd; and that then Poets exerci&s;ed the &s;ame juri&s;diction over the Follies, as Hi&s;torians did over the Vices of men. It may al&s;o be worth con&s;idering, whether Augu&s;tus him&s;elf makes the greater figure, in the writings of the former, or of the latter? and whether Nero and Domitian do not appear as ridiculous for their fal&s;e Ta&s;te and Affectation, in Per&s;ius and Juvenal, as odious for their bad Government in Tacitus and Suetonius? In the fir&s;t of the&s;e reigns it was, that Horace was protected and ca|re&s;s'd; and in the latter that Lucan was put to death, and Juvenal bani&s;h'd.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="82">
I would not have &s;aid &s;o much, but to &s;hew you my whole heart on this &s;ubject; and to convince you, I am deliberately bent to perform that Reque&s;t which you make your la&s;t to me, and to perform it with Temper, Ju&s;tice, and Re&s;olution. As your Approbation (being the te&s;timony of a &s;ound head and an hone&s;t heart) does great|ly confirm me herein, I wi&s;h you may live to &s;ee the effect it may hereafter have upon me, in &s;omething more de&s;erving of that approbation. But if it be the Will of God (which I know will al&s;o be yours) that we mu&s;t &s;eparate, I hope it will be better for You than it can be for me. You are fitter to live, or to die, than any man I know. Adieu my dear friend! and may God pre|&s;erve your life ea&s;y, or make your death happy.</P>

<P>I Am truly oblig'd by your kind condo|lance on my Father's death, and the de&s;ire you expre&s;s that I &s;hould improve this accident to my advantage. I know your Lord&s;hip's friend&s;hip to me is &s;o exten&s;ive, that you include in that wi&s;h both my Spi|ritual and my Temporal advantage; and it is what I owe to that friend&s;hip, to open my mind unre&s;ervedly to you on this head. It is true, I have lo&s;t a Parent for whom no gains I could make would be any equiva|lent: But that was not my only tye; I thank God another &s;till remains (and long may it remain) of the &s;ame tender nature: <HI>Genitrix e&s;t mihi</HI>&mdash;and excu&s;e me if I &s;ay with Euryalus,
<Q><L>&mdash;nequeam lacrymas perferre parentis.</L></Q>
A rigid Divine may call it a carnal tye, but &s;ure it is a virtuous one. At lea&s;t I am more certain that it is a Duty of Nature to pre&s;erve a good parent's life and happine&s;s, than I am of any Speculative point what|ever. <Q><L>&mdash;ignaram hujus quodcunque pericli</L>
<L>Hanc ego, nunc, linquam?</L></Q>

For &s;he, my Lord, would think this Sepa|ration more grievous than any other; and I, for my part, know as little as poor Eu|ryalus did of the &s;ucce&s;s of &s;uch an Adven|ture, (for an Adventure it is, and no &s;mall one, in &s;pite of the mo&s;t po&s;itive Divinity.) Whether the change would be to my &s;pi|ritual advantage, God only knows: this I know, I mean as well in the Religion I now profe&s;s, as I can po&s;&s;ibly ever do in any other. Can a man who thinks &s;o, ju&s;tify a change, even if he thought both equally good? To &s;uch an one, the part of <HI>Join|ing</HI> with any one body of Chri&s;tians might perhaps be ea&s;y, but I think it would not be &s;o to <HI>Renounce</HI> the other.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip has formerly advis'd me to read the be&s;t Books of Controver&s;ies be|tween the Churches. Shall I tell you a &s;e|cret? I did &s;o at fourteen years old: for I loved reading, and my father had no other books. There was a collection of all that had been written on both &s;ides in the reign of King James the &s;econd: I warm'd my head with them, and the con&s;equence was, that I found my &s;elf a Papi&s;t and a Prote|&s;tant by turns, according to the la&s;t book I read, I am afraid mo&s;t Seekers are in the &s;ame ca&s;e, and when they &s;top, they are not &s;o properly converted, as out-witted. You &s;ee how little glory you would gain by my conver&s;ion. And after all, I verily
<PB N="82" REF="89">
believe your Lord&s;hip and I are both of the &s;ame religion, if we were thoroughly un|der&s;tood by one another; and that all ho|ne&s;t and rea&s;onable Chri&s;tians would be &s;o, if they did but talk enough together every day; and had nothing to do together, but to &s;erve God and live in peace with their Neighbour.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>temporal</HI> &s;ide of the que&s;tion, I can have no di&s;pute with you. It is certain, all the beneficial circum&s;tances of life, and all the &s;hining ones, lie on the part you would invite me to. But if I could bring my&s;elf to fancy, what I think you do but fancy; that I have any talents for Active life, I want health for it; and be&s;ides it is a real truth, I have le&s;s Inclination (if po&s;&s;ible) than Ability. Contemplative life is not only my &s;cene, but it is my habit too. I begun my life where mo&s;t people end theirs, with a di&s;reli&s;h of all that the world calls Ambi|tion: I don't know why 'tis call'd &s;o, for to me it always &s;eem'd to be rather <HI>&s;tooping</HI> than <HI>climbing,</HI> I'll tell you my politic and religious &s;entiments in a few words. In my Politics, I think no farther than how to pre&s;erve the peace of my life in any Govern|ment under which I live; nor in my Reli|gion, than to pre&s;erve the peace of my con|&s;cience in any Church with which I com|municate. I hope all Churches and all Go|vernments are &s;o far of God, as they are
<PB N="83" REF="90">
rightly under&s;tood, and rightly admini&s;tred: and where they are, or may be wrong, I leave it to God alone to mend or reform them; which whenever he does, it mu&s;t be by greater In&s;truments than I am. I am not a Papi&s;t, for I renounce the temporal inva&s;ions of the Papal power, and dete&s;t their arrogated authority over Princes or States. I am a Catholic, in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word. If I was born under an ab&s;olute Prince, I would be a quiet &s;ubject; but I thank God I was not: I have a due &s;en&s;e of the excellence of the Briti&s;h con&s;ti|tution. In a word, the things I have always wi&s;hed to &s;ee, are not a Roman Catholic, or a French Catholic, or a Spani&s;h Catho|lic, but a true Catholic: and not a King of Whigs, or a King of Tories, but a King of England.

<P>I Hope you have &s;ome time ago receiv'd the Sulphur, and the two volumes of Mr Gay, as in&s;tances (how &s;mall ones &s;o|ever) that I wi&s;h you both health, and di|ver&s;ion. What I now &s;end for your peru&s;al, I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of; not to fore&s;tall by a &s;ingle word what you promis'd to &s;ay upon that &s;ubject. Your Lord&s;hip may criticize from Virgil to the&s;e Tales, as Solomon wrote of every thing from the cedar to the hy&s;op. I have &s;ome cau&s;e, &s;ince I la&s;t waited on you at Bromley, to look upon you as a Prophet in that retreat, from whom oracles are to be had were mankind wi&s;e enough to go thither to con&s;ult you. The fate of the South-&s;ea Scheme has, &s;ooner than I expected, verify'd what you told me. Mo&s;t people thought the time would come, but no man prepar'd for it, no man con&s;ider'd it would come <HI>like a Thief in the night,</HI> exactly as it happens in the ca&s;e of our death. Methinks God has puni&s;h'd the Avaritious as he often puni&s;hes &s;inners, in their own way, in the very &s;in it&s;elf: the thir&s;t of gain was their crime, that thir&s;t continued, became their puni&s;hment and ruin. As for the few who have the good fortune to remain with half of what they
<PB N="85" REF="92">
imagined they had, (among whom is your humble &s;ervant) I would have them &s;en&s;ible of their felicity; and convinc'd of the truth of old He&s;iod's maxim, who after half his e&s;tate was &s;wallowed up by the Directors of tho&s;e days, re&s;olv'd, that <HI>half</HI> to be <HI>more than the whole.</HI></P>

<P>Indeed the univer&s;al Poverty, which is the con&s;equence of univer&s;al Avarice, and which will fall harde&s;t upon the guiltle&s;s and indu&s;|trious part of mankind, is truly lamentable. The Univer&s;al deluge of the South-&s;ea, con|trary to the old deluge, has drown'd all ex|cept a few <HI>unrighteous</HI> men. But it is &s;ome comfort to me that I am not one of them, even tho' I were to &s;urvive and rule the world by it. I am much pleas'd with a thought of Dr Arbuthnot's: he &s;ays the Government and South-&s;ea company have only lock't up the money of the people upon conviction of their Lunacy (as is u&s;ual in ca&s;e of Lunatics), and intend to re&s;tore 'em as much as may be fit for &s;uch people as fa&s;t as they &s;hall &s;ee 'em return to their &s;en&s;es.</P>

The latter part of your letter does me &s;o much honour, and &s;hews me &s;o much kind|ne&s;s, that I mu&s;t both be proud and pleas'd in a great degree; but I a&s;&s;ure you, my Lord, much more the la&s;t than the fir&s;t.

I hope you may be at the Deanery towards the end of October, by which time I think of &s;ettling there for the winter. What do you think of &s;ome &s;uch &s;hort in&s;cription as this in La|tin, which may in a few words &s;ay all that is to be &s;aid of Dryden, and yet nothing more than he de&s;erves.<Q><LG>

<P>To &s;hew you that I am as much in earne&s;t in the affair as you your &s;elf, &s;omething I will &s;end you too of this kind in Engli&s;h.

<Q><L>More needs not; where acknowledg'd Merits reign,</L>

This you'll take as a proof of my zeal at lea&s;t, tho' it be none of my talent in Poe|try. When you have read it over, I'll for|give you if you &s;hould not once in your life time again think of it.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, for your <HI>Arabian Tales.</HI> Ill as I have been, almo&s;t ever &s;ince they came to hand, I have read as much of them as ever I &s;hall read while I live. Indeed they do not plea&s;e my ta&s;te: they are writ with &s;o Romantic an air, and allowing for the difference of Ea&s;tern manners, are, yet upon any &s;uppo&s;ition that can be made, of &s;o wild and ab&s;urd a contrivance, (at lea&s;t to my northern under&s;tanding) that I have not only no plea&s;ure, but no patience, in peru|&s;ing them. They are to me like the odd paintings on Indian &s;creens, which at fir&s;t glance may &s;urprize and plea&s;e a little; but when you fix your eye intently upon them
<PB N="89" REF="96">
they appear &s;o extravagant, di&s;proportion'd, and mon&s;trous, that they give a judicious eye pain, and make him &s;eek for relief from &s;ome other object. They may furni&s;h the mind with &s;ome new images; but I think the purcha&s;e is made at too great an expence: for to read tho&s;e two volumes through, liking them as little as I do, would be a terrible penance: and to read them with plea&s;ure would be dangerous on the other &s;ide, be|cau&s;e of the infection. I will never believe, that you have any keen reli&s;h of them, till I find you write wor&s;e than you do, which I dare &s;ay, I never &s;hall. Who that <HI>Petit de la Croi&s;e</HI> is, the pretended author of them, I cannot tell: but ob&s;erving how full they are in the de&s;criptions of Dre&s;s, Furniture, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I cannot help thinking them the pro|duct of &s;ome Woman's imagination: and believe me, I would do any thing but break with you, rather than be bound to read 'em over with attention.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry that I was &s;o true a Prophet in re&s;pect of the South-&s;ea, &s;orry I mean as far as your lo&s;s is concern'd: for in the ge|neral I ever was and &s;till am of opinion, that had the project taken root and flouri&s;h'd, it would by degrees have overturn'd our con&s;titution.

<P>Let me add one reflection, to make you ea&s;y in your ill luck.

I vow to you, I could live here with plea&s;ure all the winter, and be contented with hearing no more news than the London-journal, or &s;ome &s;uch trifling paper, affords me, did not the duty of my place require, ab&s;olutely require, my attendance at We&s;tmin&s;ter; where I hope the Prophet will now and then remem|ber he has a bed and a candle&s;tic.

<P>UNder all the lei&s;ure in the world, I have no lei&s;ure, no &s;tomach to write to you; the gradual approaches of death are before my eyes. I am convinc'd, that it mu&s;t be &s;o; and yet make a &s;hift to flat|ter my &s;elf &s;ometimes with the thought, that it may po&s;&s;ibly be otherwi&s;e.

Let them have more Virtue and le&s;s Pride: and then I'll court them as much as any body: but till they re&s;olve to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves &s;ome way el&s;e than by their outward Trappings, I am deter|mined (and I think I have a right) to be as proud as they are: tho' I tru&s;t in God, my pride is neither of &s;o odious a nature as theirs, nor of &s;o mi&s;chievous a con&s;e|quence.</P>

<P>I Have been as con&s;tantly at Twitenham, as your Lord&s;hip has at Bromley, ever &s;ince you &s;aw Lord Bathur&s;t. At the time of the Duke of Marlborough's funeral, I intend to lie at the Deanery, and moralize one evening with you on the Vanity of hu|man Glory.&mdash;</P>
<P>The Duche&s;s's letter concerns me nearly, and you know it, who know all my thoughts without di&s;gui&s;e.

you would repre&s;ent thus much at lea&s;t to her Grace, that as to the fear &s;he &s;eems touch'd with, [That the Duke's memory &s;hould have no advantage but what he mu&s;t give him&s;elf, without being beholden to any one Friend] Your Lord&s;hip may certainly, and agreeably to your character, both of rigid honour and chri&s;tian plainne&s;s, tell her that no man can have any other advantage: and that all offerings of Friends in &s;uch a ca&s;e pa&s;s for nothing. Be but &s;o good as to confirm what I've repre&s;ented to her, that an In&s;cription in the antient way, plain, pom|pous, and yet mode&s;t, will be the mo&s;t uncommon, and therefore the mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hing manner of doing it: And &s;o I hope &s;he will be &s;atisfied, the Duke's Ho|nour be pre&s;erv'd, and my Integrity al&s;o: which is too &s;acred a thing to be forfeited, in con&s;ideration of any little (or what people of quality may call great) Honour or Di|&s;tinction whatever, which tho&s;e of their rank can be&s;tow on one of mine; and which indeed they are apt to over-rate, but never &s;o much as when they imagine us under any obligation to &s;ay one untrue word in their favour.</P>

<P>IT is not po&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s what I think, and what I feel; only this, that I have thought and felt for nothing but you, for &s;ome time pa&s;t: and &s;hall think of nothing &s;o long for the time to come. The greate&s;t comfort I had was an intention (which I would have made practicable) to have at|tended you in your journey; to which I had brought that per&s;on to con&s;ent, who only could have hindered me, by a tye, which, though it may be more tender, I do not think more &s;trong than that of friend&s;hip. But I fear there will be no way left me to tell you this great truth, that I remem|ber you, that I love you, that I am grate|ful to you, that I entirely e&s;teem and value
<PB N="121" REF="128">
you: no way but that one, which needs no open warrant to authorize it, or &s;ecret con|veyance to &s;ecure it; which no bills can preclude, and no Kings prevent; a way that can reach to any part of the world where you may be, where the very whi&s;per, or even the wi&s;h of a friend, mu&s;t not be heard, or even &s;u&s;pected: by this way, I dare to tell my e&s;teem and affection for you, to your enemies in the gates; and you, and they, and their &s;ons, may hear of it.</P>
<P>You prove your &s;elf, my Lord, to know me for the friend I am; in judging that the manner of your Defence, and your Repu|tation by it, is a point of the highe&s;t con|cern to me: and a&s;&s;uring me it &s;hall be &s;uch, that none of your friends &s;hall blu&s;h for you. Let me further prompt you to do your &s;elf the be&s;t and mo&s;t la&s;ting ju&s;tice. The in&s;truments of your fame to po&s;terity will be in your own hands. May it not be, that providence has appointed you to &s;ome great and u&s;eful work, and calls you to it this &s;evere way? You may more eminently and more effectually &s;erve the publick even now, than in the &s;tations you have &s;o ho|nourably fill'd. Think of Tully, Bacon, and Clarendon: is it not the latter, the di&s;grac'd part of their lives, which you mo&s;t envy, and which you would choo&s;e to have liv'd.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="129">
I am tenderly &s;en&s;ible of the wi&s;h you expre&s;s, that no part of your misfortune may pur&s;ue me. But God knows I am every day le&s;s and le&s;s fond of my native country (&s;o torn as it is by Party-rage) and begin to con&s;ider a friend in exile as a friend in death; one gone before, where I am not unwilling nor unprepared to follow after; and where (however various or uncertain the roads and voyages of another world may be) I cannot but entertain a plea&s;ing hope, that we may meet again.</P>
<P>I faithfully a&s;&s;ure you, that in the mean time there is no one living or dead, of whom I &s;hall think oftner or better than of you. I &s;hall look upon you as in a &s;tate between both, in which you will have from me all the pa&s;&s;ions and warm wi&s;hes that can attend the living, and all the re&s;pect and tender &s;en&s;e of lo&s;s, that we feel for the dead. And I &s;hall ever depend upon your con&s;tant friend&s;hip, kind memory, and good offices, though I were never to &s;ee or hear the effects of them: like the tru&s;t we have in benevolent Spirits, who, tho' we never &s;ee or hear them, we think are con&s;tantly &s;erving us, and praying for us.</P>
<P>Whenever I am wi&s;hing to write to you, I &s;hall conclude you are intentionally doing &s;o to me: and every time that I think of you, I believe you are thinking of me. I never &s;hall &s;uffer to be forgotten (nay to be

In conver&s;ation, in &s;tudy, I &s;hall always want you, and wi&s;h for you. In my mo&s;t lively, and in my mo&s;t thoughtful hours, I &s;hall equally bear about me, the impre&s;&s;ions of you: And perhaps it will not be in This life only, that I &s;hall have cau&s;e to re|member and acknowledge the Friend&s;hip of the Bi&s;hop of ROCHESTER.</P>

<P>ONce more I write to you as I promis'd, and this once I fear will be the la&s;t! the Curtain will &s;oon be drawn between my friend and me, and nothing left but to wi&s;h you a long good night. May you enjoy a &s;tate of repo&s;e in this life, not unlike that Sleep of the &s;oul which &s;ome have believ'd is to &s;ucceed it, where we lye utterly forgetful of that world from which
<PB N="124" REF="131">
we are gone, and ripening for that to which we are to go. If you retain any memory of the pa&s;t, let it only image to you what has pleas'd you be&s;t; &s;ometimes pre&s;ent a dream of an ab&s;ent friend, or bring you back an agreeable conver&s;ation. But upon the whole, I hope you will think le&s;s of the time pa&s;t than of the future; as the former has been le&s;s kind to you than the latter infallibly will be. Do not envy the world your Studies; they will tend to the benefit of men again&s;t whom you can have no complaint, I mean of all Po&s;terity: and per|haps at your time of life, nothing el&s;e is worth your care. What is every year of a wi&s;e man's life but a cen&s;ure or critique on the pa&s;t? Tho&s;e who&s;e date is the &s;horte&s;t, live long enough to laugh at one half of it: the boy de&s;pi&s;es the infant, the man the boy, the philo&s;oper both, and the chri&s;tian all. You may now begin to think your manhood was too much a puerility: and you'll never &s;uffer your age to be but a &s;econd infancy. The toys and baubles of your childhood are hardly now more below you, than tho&s;e toys of our riper and of our declining years, the drums and rattles of Ambition, and the dirt and bubbles of Ava|rice. At this time, when you are cut off from a little &s;ociety, and made a citizen of the world at large, you &s;hould bend your talents not to &s;erve a Party, or a few, but
<PB N="125" REF="132">
all Mankind. Your Genius &s;hould mount above that mi&s;t in which it's participation and neighbourhood with earth long involv'd it: To &s;hine abroad and to heaven, ought to be the bu&s;ine&s;s and the glory of your pre|&s;ent &s;ituation. Remember it was at &s;uch a time, that the greate&s;t lights of antiquity dazled and blazed the mo&s;t; in their re|treat, in their exile, or in their death: but why do I talk of dazling or blazing? it was then that they did good, that they gave light, and that they became Guides to mankind.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e aims alone are worthy of &s;pirits truly great, and &s;uch I therefore hope will be yours. Re&s;entment indeed may remain, perhaps cannot be quite extingui&s;hed, in the noble&s;t minds; but revenge will never har|bour there: higher principles than tho&s;e of the fir&s;t, and better principles than tho&s;e of the latter, will infallibly influence men who&s;e thoughts and who&s;e minds are en|larged, and cau&s;e them to prefer the Whole to any part of mankind, e&s;pecially to &s;o &s;mall a part as one's &s;ingle &s;elf.</P>
<P>Believe me, my Lord, I look upon you as a Spirit enter'd into another life, as one ju&s;t upon the edge of immortality, where the Pa&s;&s;ions and Affections are much more exalted, and where you ought to de&s;pi&s;e all little views, and all mean Retro&s;pects.

<HEAD>The Duke of BUCKINGHAM to Mr POPE.</HEAD>
<P>YOU de&s;ire my opinion as to the late di&s;pute in France concerning Homer: And I think it excu&s;able (at an age alas of not much plea&s;ure) to amu&s;e my &s;elf a little in taking notice of a controver&s;y, than which nothing is at pre&s;ent more remark|able (even in a nation who value them|&s;elves &s;o much upon the Belles Lettres) both on account of the illu&s;trious &s;ubject of it, and of the two per&s;ons ingaged in the quarrel.</P>
<P>The one is extraordinary in all the Lyric kind of Poetry even in the opinion of his very adver&s;ary. The other a Lady (and of more value for being &s;o) not only of great
<PB N="127" REF="134">
Learning, but with a Genius admirably turn'd to that &s;ort of it which mo&s;t becomes her Sex, for &s;oftne&s;s, genteelne&s;s, and pro|moting of virtue: and &s;uch as (one would think) is not &s;o liable as other parts of &s;cho|lar&s;hip, to rough di&s;putes, or violent ani|mo&s;ity.</P>
<P>Yet it has &s;o happen'd, that no writers, even about Divinity it &s;elf, have been more outragious or uncharitable than the&s;e two polite authors; by &s;uffering their judgments to be a little warped (if I may u&s;e that ex|pre&s;&s;ion) by the heat of their eager inclina|tions, to attack or defend &s;o great an Au|thor under debate: I wi&s;h for the &s;ake of the public, which is now &s;o well entertain'd by their quarrel, it may not end at la&s;t in their agreeing to blame a third man who is &s;o pre&s;umptuous as to cen&s;ure both, if they &s;hould chance to hear of it.</P>
<P>To begin with matter of fact. Madam Dacier has well judg'd, that the be&s;t of all Poets certainly de&s;erv'd a better tran&s;lation, at lea&s;t into French pro&s;e, becau&s;e to &s;ee it done in ver&s;e was de&s;pair'd of: I believe in|deed from a defect in that language, inca|pable of mounting to any degree of excel|lence &s;uitable to &s;o very great an under|taking.</P>
<P>She has not only perform'd this task as well as pro&s;e can do it, (which is indeed but as the wrong &s;ide of Tape&s;try is able to re|pre&s;ent
<PB N="128" REF="135">
pre&s;ent the right) but &s;he has added to it al&s;o many learned and u&s;eful annotations. With all which &s;he mo&s;t obligingly delighted not only her own &s;ex, but mo&s;t of ours, igno|rant of the Greek, and con&s;equently her ad|ver&s;ary him&s;elf, who frankly acknowledges that ignorance.</P>
<P>'Tis no wonder therefore, if in doing this, &s;he is grown &s;o inamour'd of that un&s;peak|ably-charming Author, as to have a kind of horror at the lea&s;t mention of a man bold enough to blame him.</P>
<P>Now as to M. de la Motte, he being al|ready de&s;ervedly famous for all &s;orts of Ly|ric poetry, was &s;o far introduc'd by her in|to tho&s;e beauties of the Epic kind, (tho' but in that way of tran&s;lation) as not to re&s;i&s;t the plea&s;ure and hope of reputation by at|tempting that in ver&s;e, which had been ap|plauded &s;o much for the difficulty of doing it even in pro&s;e; knowing how this, well executed, mu&s;t extreamly tran&s;cend the other.</P>
<P>But, as great Poets are a little apt to think they have an ancient right of being excus'd for Vanity on all occa&s;ions; he was not content to out-do Madam Dacier, but endea|vour'd to out-do Homer him&s;elf, and all that ever in any age or nation went before him in the &s;ame enterprize; by leaving out, altering, or adding whatever he thought be&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="136">
Again&s;t this pre&s;umptuous attempt, Ho|mer has been in all times &s;o well defended, as not to need my &s;mall a&s;&s;i&s;tance; yet I mu&s;t needs &s;ay his excellencies are &s;uch, that for their &s;ake he de&s;erves a much gentler touch for his &s;eeming errors. The&s;e if M. de la Motte had tran&s;lated as well as the re&s;t, with an apology for having retain'd 'em only out of meer veneration; his judg|ment in my opinion would have appear'd much greater than by the be&s;t of his altera|tions, though I admit them to be written very finely. I join with M. de la Motte in wondering at &s;ome odd things in Homer, but 'tis chiefly becau&s;e of his &s;ublime ones, I was about to &s;ay his divine ones, which almo&s;t &s;urprize me at finding him any where in the fallible condition of humane nature.</P>
<P>And now we are wond'ring, I am in a difficulty to gue&s;s, what can be the rea&s;on of the&s;e exceptions again&s;t Homer. from one who has him&s;elf tran&s;lated him, con|trary to the general cu&s;tom of tran&s;lators. Is there not a little of that in it? I mean to be &s;ingular in getting above the title of a Tran&s;lator, tho' &s;ufficiently honourable in this ca&s;e. For &s;uch an ambition no body has le&s;s occa&s;ion, than one who is &s;o fine a Poet in other kinds; and who mu&s;t have too much wit to believe, any alteration of another can intitle him to the denomination of an <HI>Epic Poet</HI> him&s;elf: though no man
<PB N="130" REF="137">
in this age &s;eems more capable of being a good one, if the <HI>French</HI> tongue would bear it. Yet in his tran&s;lation he has done too well, to leave any doubt (with all his faults) that her's can be ever parallel'd with it.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides he could not be ignorant, that finding faults is the mo&s;t ea&s;y and vulgar part of a critic; whereas nothing &s;hews &s;o much skill and ta&s;te both, as the being throughly &s;en&s;ible of the &s;ublime&s;t excel|lencies.</P>
<P>What can we &s;ay in excu&s;e of all this? <HI>Humanum e&s;t errare:</HI> Since as good a Poet as I believe the French language is capable of, and as &s;harp a Critic as any nation can produce, has by too much cen&s;uring Ho|mer, &s;ubjected a tran&s;lation to cen&s;ure, that would have otherwi&s;e &s;tood the te&s;t of the &s;evere&s;t adver&s;ary.</P>
<P>But &s;ince he would needs chu&s;e that wrong way of critici&s;m, I wonder he mi&s;s'd a &s;tone &s;o ea&s;y to be thrown again&s;t Homer, for his filling the Iliad with &s;o much&s;laugh|ter, (for that is to be excu&s;ed, &s;ince a War is not capable of being de&s;cribed without it) but with &s;o many various particulars of wounds and horror, as &s;hew the writer (I am afraid) &s;o delighted that way him&s;elf, as not the lea&s;t to doubt his reader being &s;o al&s;o. Like Spainoletta, who&s;e di&s;mal pic|tures are the more di&s;agreeable for being al|ways &s;o very movingly painted. Even

Hector's la&s;t parting from his &s;on and An|dromache, hardly makes us amends for his body's being dragg'd thrice round the town. M. de la Motte in his &s;tronge&s;t objection about that di&s;mal combat, has &s;ufficient cau&s;e to blame his inrag'd adver&s;ary; who here gives an in&s;tance that it is impo&s;&s;ible to be violent without committing &s;ome mi|&s;take; her pa&s;&s;ion for Homer blinding her too much to perceive the very gro&s;&s;e&s;t of his failings. By which warning I am become a little more capable of impartiality, though in a di&s;pute about that very Poet for whom I have the greate&s;t veneration.</P>
<P>Madam Dacier might have con&s;ider'd a lit|tle, that whatever were the motives of M. de la Motte to &s;o bold a proceeding, it could not darken that fame which I am &s;ure &s;he thinks &s;hines &s;ecurely even after the vain at|tempts of Plato him&s;elf again&s;t it: caus'd only perhaps by a like rea&s;on with that of Madam Dacier's anger again&s;t M. de la Motte, namely, the finding that in pro&s;e his genius (great as it was) could not be ca|pable of the &s;ublime heights of poetry, which therefore he bani&s;h'd out of his com|mon-wealth.</P>
<P>Nor were the&s;e objections to Homer any more le&s;&s;ening of her merit in tran&s;lating him, as well as that way is capable of, viz. fully, plainly, and elegantly, than the mo&s;t
<PB N="132" REF="139">
admirable ver&s;es can be any di&s;paragement to an excellent pro&s;e.</P>
<P>The be&s;t excu&s;e for all this violence is, it's being in a Cau&s;e which gives a kind of repu|tation even to &s;uffering by never &s;o ill a ma|nagement of it.</P>
<P>The wor&s;t of defending even Homer in &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ionate manner, is it's being more a proof of her weakne&s;s, than of his being liable to none. For what is it can excu&s;e Homer any more than Hector, for flying at the fir&s;t &s;ight of Achilles? who&s;e terri|ble a&s;pect &s;ure needed not &s;uch an inexcu|&s;able fright to &s;et it off; and methinks all that account of Minerva's re&s;toring his dart to Achilles, comes a little too late, for ex|cu&s;ing Hector's &s;o terrible apprehen&s;ion at the very fir&s;t.</P>

<P>I Am much honour'd by your Grace's compliance with my reque&s;t, in giving me your opinion of the French di&s;pute con|cerning Homer. And I &s;hall keep my word, in fairly telling wherein I di&s;agree from you. It is but in two or three very &s;mall points, not &s;o much of the di&s;pute, as of the par|ties

concern'd in it. I cannot think quite &s;o highly of the Lady's learning, tho' I re|&s;pect it very much. It is great complai|&s;ance in that polite nation, to allow her to be a Critic of equal rank with her husband. To in&s;tance no further, his remarks on Horace &s;hew more good Sen&s;e, Penetration, and a better Ta&s;te of his author, and tho&s;e upon Ari&s;totle's art of poetry more Skill and Science, than any of hers on any author whatever. In truth, they are much more &s;light, dwell more in generals, and are be|&s;ides for the mo&s;t part le&s;s her own, of which her remarks upon Homer are an example; where Eu&s;tathius is tran&s;cribed ten times for once that he is quoted. Nor is there at all more depth or learning in tho&s;e upon Terence, Plautus, (or where they were mo&s;t wanted) upon Ari&s;tophanes, only the Greek Scholia upon the latter are &s;ome of the be&s;t extant.</P>
<P>Your Grace will believe me, that I did not &s;earch to find defects in a Lady; my employment upon the Iliad forc'd me to &s;ee them: yet I had &s;o much French com|plai&s;ance as to conceal her thefts; for where|ever I have found her notes to be wholly anothers, (which is the ca&s;e in &s;ome hun|dreds) I have barely quoted the true Pro|prietor without ob&s;erving upon it. If Ma|dam Dacier has ever &s;een my ob&s;ervations, &s;he will be &s;en&s;ible of this conduct, but
<PB N="134" REF="141">
what effect it may have upon a Lady, I will not an&s;wer for.</P>
<P>In the next place, as to Mr. de la Motte, I think your Grace hardly does him right, in &s;uppo&s;ing he could have no idea of the beauties of Homer's Epic Poetry but what he learn'd from Madam Dacier's Pro&s;e-tran|&s;lation. There had been a very elegant Pro&s;e-tan&s;lation before by Mon&s;ieur de la Valtaire, lo elegant, that the &s;tyle of it was evidently the original and model of the fa|mous Telemaque. Your Grace very ju&s;tly animadverts again&s;t the too great di&s;po&s;ition of finding faults, in the one, and of con|fe&s;&s;ing none, in the other: But doubtle&s;s, as to Violence, the Lady has infinitely the better of the Gentleman. Nothing can be more polite, di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate or &s;en&s;ible, than Mr de la Motte's manner of managing the di&s;pute: and &s;o much as I &s;ee your Grace admires the beauty of his ver&s;e (in which you have the &s;uffrage too of the Archbi&s;hop of Cambray) I will venture to &s;ay, his pro&s;e is full as good. I think therefore when you &s;ay, no di&s;putants ev'n in Divinity could be more outrageous and uncharitable than the&s;e two authors, you are a little too hard upon M. de la Motte. Not but that (with your Grace) I doubt as little of the zeal of Com|mentators as of the zeal of Divines, and am as ready to believe of the pa&s;&s;ions and pride of mankind in general, that (did but the
<PB N="135" REF="142">
&s;ame intere&s;ts go along with them) they would carry the learned world to as violent extremes, animo&s;ities, and even per&s;ecutions, about variety of opinions in Critici&s;m, as ever they did about Religion: and that in defect of Scripture to quarrel upon, we &s;hou'd have French, Italian, and Dutch Commentators ready to burn one another about Homer, Virgil, Terence and Horace.</P>
<P>I do not wonder your Grace is &s;hock'd at the flight of Hector upon the fir&s;t ap|pearance of Achilles in the twenty-&s;econd Iliad. However (to &s;hew my &s;elf a true Commentator, if not a true Critic) I will endeavour to excu&s;e, if not to defend it, in my notes on that Book. And to &s;ave my &s;elf what trouble I can, in&s;tead of doing it in this letter, I will draw up the &s;ub&s;tance of what I have to &s;ay for it in a &s;eparate paper which I'll &s;hew your Grace when next we meet. I will only de&s;ire you to allow me, that Hector was in an ab&s;olute certainty of death, and depre&s;s'd over and above with the con&s;cience of being in an ill cau&s;e. If your heart be &s;o great, as not to grant the fir&s;t of the&s;e will &s;ink the &s;pi|rit of a Hero, you'll at lea&s;t be &s;o good, as to allow the &s;econd may: But I can tell your Grace, no le&s;s a Hero than my Lord Peterborow, when a per&s;on complimented him for never being afraid, made this an|&s;wer; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sir, &s;hew me a danger that I think

<HEAD>Madam DACIER's Reflections on Mr POPE's Account of HOMER in his Preface to the ILIAD.</HEAD>
<P>UPON the fini&s;hing of the <HI>&s;econd Edi|tion</HI> of my tran&s;lation of <HI>Homer,</HI> a particular friend &s;ent me a tran&s;lation of part of Mr Pope's preface to his ver&s;ion of the ILIAD. As I do not under&s;tand <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> I cannot form any judgment of his perfor|mance, tho' I have heard much of it. I am indeed willing to believe, that the prai&s;es it has met with are not unmerited, becau&s;e whatever Work is approved by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> nation, cannot be bad; but yet I hope I may be permitted to judge of that part of the Pre|face which has been tran&s;mitted to me, and I here take the liberty of giving my &s;enti|ments thereon. I mu&s;t freely acknowledge, that Mr Pope's <HI>invention</HI> is very lively, tho' he &s;eems to have been guilty of the &s;ame fault into which he owns we are often pre|cipitated by our <HI>invention,</HI> when we depend too much upon the &s;trength of it: <Q REND="inline margQuotes"><HI>As</HI>
<PB N="137" REF="144">
<HI>magnanimity,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>may run up to profu|&s;ion and extravagance, &s;o may a great inven|tion to redundancy or wildne&s;s.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This has been the very ca&s;e of Mr <HI>Pope</HI> him&s;elf; nothing is more over&s;trained or more fal&s;e than the Images in which his fancy has repre&s;ented HOMER: Sometimes he tells us, that the ILIAD is a <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>wild Para|di&s;e, where, if we cannot &s;ee all the Beau|ties, as in an ordered garden, it is only be|cau&s;e the number of them is infinitely grea|ter.</HI>"</Q>  Sometimes he compares him to <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>a copious nur&s;ery, which contains the &s;eeds and fir&s;t productions of every kind</HI>";</Q> and la&s;tly, he repre&s;ents him under the no|tion of a <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>mighty tree, which ri&s;es from the mo&s;t vigorous &s;eed, is improved with indu|&s;try, flouri&s;hes and produces the fine&s;t fruit, but bears too many branches, which might be lopped into form, to give it a more regu|lar appearance</HI>".</Q></P>
<P>What! Is <HI>Homer</HI>'s Poem then, according to Mr <HI>Pope,</HI> a confu&s;ed heap of Beauties, without order or &s;ymmetry; a plat whereon nothing but &s;eeds, nor nothing perfect or formed is to be found; and a production loaded with many unprofitable things, which ought to be retrenched, and which choak or disfigure tho&s;e which ought to be pre|&s;erved?</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="145">
The mo&s;t inveterate enemies to <HI>Homer,</HI> never &s;aid any thing more injurious, or more unju&s;t, again&s;t that Poet.</P>
<P>As I have defended him, with pretty good &s;ucce&s;s, again&s;t the cavils of &s;o many igno|rant Cen&s;ors, who have condemn'd him be|cau&s;e they did not under&s;tand him. I find my &s;elf again obliged to defend him again&s;t the reproaches of one of greater penetra|tion, and may therefore do him more in|jury in the minds of unlearned readers, tho' at the &s;ame time he pretends to have a great Veneration for him.</P>
<P>Mr <HI>Pope</HI> will pardon me then, if I here oppo&s;e the&s;e three compari&s;ons, which to me appear very fal&s;e, and entirely contrary to what the greate&s;t, antient, and modern critics ever thought.</P>
<P>To the point then, the ILIAD is &s;o far from being a wild paradi&s;e, that it is the mo&s;t regular garden, and laid out with more &s;ymmetry than any ever was. Mon&s;ieur <HI>le No&s;tre</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gardiner to Lewis XIV. He laid out the Gar|dens of Ver&s;ailles, Marli, &amp;c.</NOTE>, who was the fir&s;t man of the world in his art, never ob&s;erved in his gar|dens a more perfect or more admirable &s;ym|metry, than <HI>Homer</HI> has ob&s;erved in his poems. Every thing therein, is not only in the place it ought to have, but every thing is made for the place it hath. He pre&s;ents you at <HI>fir&s;t</HI> with that which ought
<PB N="139" REF="146">
to be <HI>fir&s;t</HI> &s;een, he places in the <HI>middle</HI> what ought to be in the <HI>middle,</HI> and what would improperly be, at the <HI>beginning</HI> or <HI>end;</HI> and he removes what ought to be at a greater di&s;tance, to create the more agreeable &s;urprize; and, to u&s;e a compari&s;on drawn from painting, he places that in the greate&s;t <HI>light</HI> which cannot be too <HI>vi&s;ible,</HI> and &s;inks, in the ob&s;curity of the <HI>&s;hade,</HI> what does not require <HI>a full view:</HI> &s;o that it may be &s;aid, that <HI>Homer</HI> is the painter who be&s;t knew how to employ the &s;hades and lights, and it was this wonderfully beauteous order which <HI>Horace</HI> admired in his poems, and on which he founded his rules for the perfecting of the <HI>Art</HI> of <HI>Poetry.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>&s;econd</HI> compari&s;on is as unju&s;t: How could Mr <HI>Pope</HI> &s;ay, that one can only di&s;cover, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Seeds and the fir&s;t productions of every kind in the</HI> ILIAD?"</Q> Every beau|ty is therein to &s;o great a perfection, that the following ages could add nothing to tho&s;e of any kind; and the antients have always propo&s;ed <HI>Homer</HI> as the mo&s;t perfect model in all kinds of poetry.</P>
<P>The <HI>third</HI> compari&s;on is compo&s;ed of the errors of the <HI>two</HI> former; <HI>Homer</HI> had certain|ly an incomparable fertility of invention, but his fertility is always checked by that ju&s;t &s;en&s;e, which made him reject every &s;uper|fluous thing which his va&s;t imagination could offer him, to retain only what was u&s;eful or
<PB N="140" REF="147">
nece&s;&s;ary. Judgment guided the hand of this admirable gardiner, and was the pru|ning-hook he employ'd to lop off every u&s;e|le&s;s Branch; he has done what <HI>Horace</HI> di|rects.
<Q><L>Inutile&s;que falce ramos amputans feliciores in&s;erit.</L></Q></P>
<P>Mr <HI>Pope</HI> had done us a great piece of &s;er|vice, if he had pointed out the <HI>u&s;ele&s;s</HI> Branches that ought to be lopp'd from this tree. The <HI>&s;ymmetry</HI> which ought to be given to that wild garden to render it more <HI>regular</HI> and the <HI>perfection</HI> which is wanting to the &s;everal beauties, he &s;ays <HI>Homer</HI> has only <HI>&s;ketched out;</HI> it would be very happy for the pre&s;ent age, and glorious to <HI>England,</HI> to have produced &s;o perfect a critic.</P>
<P>Now I have defended <HI>Homer,</HI> I mu&s;t al&s;o defend my&s;elf again&s;t a critici&s;m he has made upon a part of my <HI>Preface;</HI> where &s;peaking of the manners of <HI>Homer</HI>'s He|roes, &s;o like tho&s;e of the Patriarchs, I have &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes"><HI>I find the&s;e antient times &s;o much the finer, as they the le&s;s re&s;emble our own.</HI></Q> Up|on this Mr <HI>Pope</HI> exclaims, <Q REND="inline margQuotes"><HI>Who can be &s;o prejudiced in their favour, as to magnify their felicity, when a &s;pirit of revenge and cruelty reigned through the world, when no mercy was &s;hewn but for the &s;ake of lucre, when the greate&s;t Princes were put to the &s;word, and their wives and daughters made</HI>
<PB N="141" REF="148">
<HI>&s;laves and concubines?</HI></Q> Mr <HI>Pope</HI> &s;ure mi&s;|took me!</P>
<P>When I &s;aid &s;o, could I mean that the manners of the&s;e heroical times were <HI>perfect</HI> and without <HI>fault!</HI> Were they &s;o in more happy times! Were there no tokens then of cruelty or revenge! Were there no captives made! Were there no kings put to the &s;word! Were there no concubines &s;een among them! And &s;ince the chri&s;tian reli|gion has taught a more perfect morality, was there never a &s;pirit of revenge and cruel|ty &s;een among&s;t Chri&s;tians! Do they not make no more pri&s;oners of War! and do not they redeem them! Was there never a concubine, or &s;omething wor&s;e, &s;een among them! Did all the&s;e vices, which Mr <HI>Pope</HI> blames tho&s;e antient times for, hinder nature from being then very plain, far from the luxury, pomp, and effeminacy which have corrupted the following ages! Are not the&s;e manners of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Heroes very like tho&s;e of the Patriarchs, and very unlike the&s;e of our own time! I might then &s;ay, that <HI>tho&s;e times and manners &s;eemed &s;o much the more excellent to me, as they le&s;s re&s;emble tho&s;e of our own.</HI> Dur&s;t Mr <HI>Pope</HI> him&s;elf prefer the manners of the pre&s;ent age to tho&s;e of the antient times! no, with|out doubt; for &s;ix lines after he embraces my opinion, which he had blamed: <HI>I find,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>a plea&s;ure in ob&s;erving the &s;implicity</HI>
<PB N="142" REF="149">
<HI>of that age, in oppo&s;ition to the pomp and luxury of the following ages.</HI> One may then, according to his own &s;en&s;e, prefer tho&s;e ages of natural &s;implicity to the&s;e that are corrupted with pomp and luxury.</P>
<P>I own I did not expect to find my &s;elf attacked by Mr <HI>Pope,</HI> in a <HI>Preface</HI> wherein I might have expected &s;ome &s;mall token of acknowledgment, or at lea&s;t &s;ome &s;light ap|probation; for having been &s;o happy as to think on &s;everal things in the way he him&s;elf does, e&s;pecially in the manners of the an|tients, after I had &s;aid in my <HI>Preface,</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>That Princes tended their flocks. That Prince&s;&s;es drew water at the &s;pring,</HI>"</Q> and brought examples to prove this from the holy &s;criptures, and the <HI>Roman</HI> hi&s;tory it|&s;elf, I conclude with the&s;e words: <HI>I love to &s;ee</HI> Juno <HI>dre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf without the trin|kets of a toilet, or the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a waiting woman; it is the &s;ame with the Heroes as with the Gods, one &s;ees neither Footmen, nor Valets de Chambre, nor Guards about</HI> ACHIL|LES, AGAMEMNON, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> HERCULES <HI>and</HI> THESEUS <HI>had none of the&s;e.</HI> Mr POPE &s;ays the &s;ame thing, <HI>There is a plea&s;ure in be|holding Monarchs without their guards, Princes tending</HI> their flocks, and Prince&s;&s;es drawing water <HI>from the &s;prings.</HI></P>
<P>I am overjoyed to find that Mr <HI>Pope</HI> is as much in love with the &s;implicity of the an|tient times as I am; it is a token that he
<PB N="143" REF="150">
abhors the pomp and luxury of our own, and gives me rea&s;on to hope, that a little reflection will induce him to approve what I have &s;aid, and he has &s;o unju&s;tly con|demned.</P>
<P>I could remark upon &s;everal other things in his <HI>Preface</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This Preface of Madam DACIER was written long before Mr POPE wrote <HI>his,</HI> and I think the lady is very mode&s;t when he u&s;es her own words, to &s;ay that <HI>&s;he</HI> was happy in having <HI>thought</HI> as <HI>he</HI> did; tho' it is plain that he borrowed this <HI>Thought</HI> from her: And the Approbation of Mr Fraguier, who certainly was a good Judge, gives her an Encomium, that &s;hews &s;he is both an excellent.

<HEAD>LETTERS OF Mr BLOUNT to Mr POPE.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<P>IT is with a great deal of plea&s;ure I &s;ee your letter, dear Sir, written in a &s;tile that &s;hows you full of health, and in the mid&s;t of diver&s;ions: I think tho&s;e two things nece&s;&s;ary to a man who has &s;uch un|dertakings in hand as yours. All lovers of Homer are indebted to you for taking &s;o much pains about the &s;ituation of his Hero's kingdoms; it will not only be of great u&s;e with regard to his works, but to all that read any of the Greek Hi&s;torians; who ge|nerally are ill under&s;tood thro' the difference of the maps as to the places they treat of, which makes one think one author contra|dicts another. You are going to &s;et us right; and 'tis an advantage every body will gladly &s;ee you engro&s;s the glory of.</P>
<P>You can draw rules to be free and ea&s;y, from formal pedants; and teach men to be &s;hort and pertinent, from tedious commen|tators. However, I congratulate your happy deliverance from &s;uch authors, as you (with all your humanity) cannot wi&s;h alive again to conver&s;e with. Critics will quarrel with you, if you dare to plea&s;e without their leave; and Zealots will &s;hrug up their &s;houlders at a man, that pretends to get to
<PB N="148" REF="155">
Heaven out of their form, dre&s;s, and diet. I would no more make a judgment of an author's genius from a damning critic, than I would of a man's religion from an un|&s;aving zealot.</P>
<P>I could take great delight in affording you the new glory of making a Barceloniad (if I may venture to coin &s;uch a word) I fancy you would find a ju&s;ter parallel than it &s;eems at fir&s;t &s;ight; for the Trojans too had a great mixture of folly with their brave|ry: and I am out of countenance for them when I read the wife re&s;ult of their council, where after a warm debate between Antenor and Paris about re&s;toring Helen, Priam &s;age|ly determines that they &s;hall go to &s;upper. And as for the Greeks, what can equal their &s;uper&s;tition in &s;acrificing an innocent lady?
<Q><L>Tantum Religio potuit, &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>I have a good opinion of my politics, &s;ince they agree with a man who always thinks &s;o ju&s;tly as you. I wi&s;h it were in our power to per&s;uade all the nation into as calm and &s;teady a di&s;po&s;ition of mind.</P>
<P>We have receiv'd the late melancholy news, with the u&s;ual ceremony of condoling in one breath for the lo&s;s of a gracious Queen, and in another rejoycing for an il|lu&s;trious King. My views carry me no far|ther, than to wi&s;h the peace and welfare of

my country; and my morals and politics, teach me to leave all that to be adju&s;ted by our repre&s;entatives above, and to divine providence. It is much at one to you and me who &s;it at the helm, provided they will permit us to &s;ail quietly in the great &s;hip. Ambition is a vice that is timely mortify'd in us poor Papi&s;ts; we ought in recom|pence to cultivate as many virtues in our &s;elves as we can, that we may be truly great. Among my Ambitions, that of being a &s;in|cere friend is one of the chief; yet I will confe&s;s that I have a &s;ecret plea&s;ure to have &s;ome of my de&s;cendants know, that their Ance&s;tor was great with Mr Pope.</P>

How|ever, it may look ungenerous to reproach people in di&s;tre&s;s. I don't remember you and I ever u&s;ed to trouble our &s;elves about politics, but when any matter hap|pen'd to fall into our di&s;cour&s;e, we us'd to condemn all undertakings that tended towards the di&s;turbing the peace and quiet of our country, as contrary to the notions we had of morality and religion, which oblige us on no pretence what&s;oever to vio|late the laws of charity: how many lives have there been lo&s;t in hot blood, and how many more are there like to be taken off in cold? If the broils of the nation affect you, come down to me, and though we are farmers, you know Eumeus made his friends welcome. You &s;hall here wor&s;hip the Ec|cho at your ea&s;e; indeed we are forc'd to do &s;o, becau&s;e we can't hear the fir&s;t report, and therefore are oblig'd to li&s;ten to the &s;e|cond;

<P>I Have read your letter over and over with delight. By your de&s;cription of the town, I imagine it to lie under &s;ome great enchantment, and am very much concerned for you and all my friends in it. I am the more afraid, imagining &s;ince you do not fly tho&s;e horrible mon&s;ters, rapine, di&s;&s;imula|tion, and luxury, that a magic circle is drawn about you, and you cannot e&s;cape. We are here in the country in quite another world, &s;urrounded with ble&s;&s;ings and plea|&s;ures, without any occa&s;ion of exerci&s;ing our ira&s;cible faculties; indeed we cannot boa&s;t of good-breeding and the art of life, but yet we don't live unplea&s;antly in primitive &s;impli|city and good humour. The fa&s;hions of the town affect us but ju&s;t like a raree-&s;how, we have a curio&s;ity to peep at 'em and nothing more. What you call pride, prodigality, and vain-glory, we cannot find in pomp and &s;plendour at this di&s;tance; it appears to us a fine glittering &s;cene, which if we don't envy you, we think you happier than we are in enjoying it.

I can't forbear telling you we in|deed read the &s;poils of Rapine as boys do the Engli&s;h rogue, and hug our &s;elves full as much over it; yet our ro&s;es are not without thorns.

<P>YOUR letter which I had two po&s;ts a|go was very medicinal to me; and I heartily thank you for the relief it gave me. I was &s;ick of the thoughts of my not having in all this time given you any te&s;timony of the affection I owe you, and which I as con|&s;tantly indeed feel as I think of you. This in|deed was a trouble&s;ome ill to me, 'till after reading your letter I found it was a mo&s;t idle weak imagination to think I could &s;o offend you: Of all the impre&s;&s;ions you have made upon me, I never received any with greater
<PB N="154" REF="161">
joy than this of your abundant good-nature, which bids me be a&s;&s;ured of &s;ome &s;hare of your affections.</P>
<P>I had many other plea&s;ures from your let|ter; that your mother remembers me is a ve|ry &s;incere joy to me; I cannot but reflect how alike you are; from the time you do any one a favour, you think your&s;elves ob|liged as tho&s;e that have received one. This is indeed an old-fa&s;hioned re&s;pect, hardly to be found out of your hou&s;e. I have great hopes however to &s;ee many old-fa&s;hioned vir|tues revive, &s;ince you have made our age in love with Homer; I heartily wi&s;h you, who are as good a citizen as a poet, the joy of &s;eeing a reformation from your works. I am in doubt whether I &s;hould congratulate your having fini&s;hed Homer, while the two E&s;&s;ays you mention are not compleated; but if you expect no great trouble from fini&s;hing the&s;e, I heartily rejoyce with you.</P>
<P>I have &s;ome faint notion of the beauties of Twickenham from what I here &s;ee round me. The verdure of &s;howers is poured up|on every tree and field about us; the gardens unfold variety of colours to the eye every morning; the hedges breath is beyond all perfume; and the &s;ong of birds we hear as well as you. But tho' I hear and &s;ee all this, yet I think they would delight me more if you was here. I found the want of the&s;e at Twickenham while I was there with you,

by which I gue&s;s what an increa&s;e of charms it mu&s;t now have.

<P>I Can't return from &s;o agreeable an enter|tainment as yours in the country with|out acknowledging it. I thank you heartily for the new Idea of life you there gave me; it will remain long with me, for it is very &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed upon my imagination. I repeat the memory of it often, and &s;hall va|lue that faculty of the mind now more than ever, for the power it gives me of being en|tertained in your villa, when ab&s;ent from it. As you are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the plea&s;ures of the country, and as I think of a right mind. what can I wi&s;h you but health to enjoy them? This I &s;o heartily do, that I &s;hould be even glad to hear your good old mother might lo&s;e all her pre&s;ent plea&s;ures in her unwearied care of you, by your better health convincing her it is unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>I am troubled and &s;hall be &s;o, till I hear you have received this letter: for you gave me the greate&s;t plea&s;ure imaginable in yours,
<PB N="160" REF="167">
and I am impatient to acknowledge it. If I any ways de&s;erve that friendly warmth and affection with which you write, it is, that I have a heart full of love and e&s;teem for you. So truly, that I &s;hould lo&s;e the greate&s;t plea|&s;ure of my life if I lo&s;t your good opinion. It rejoices me very much to be reckoned by you in the cla&s;s of hone&s;t men; for tho' I am not troubled overmuch about the opini|on mo&s;t may have of me, yet I own it wou'd grieve me not to be thought well of, by you and &s;ome few others. I will not doubt my own &s;trength, yet I have this fur|ther &s;ecurity to maintain my integrity, that I cannot part with that, without forfeiting your e&s;teem with it.</P>
<P>Perpetual di&s;order and ill health hath for &s;ome years &s;o di&s;gui&s;ed me, that I &s;ome|times fear I do not to my be&s;t friends enough appear what I really am. Sickne&s;s is a great oppre&s;&s;or; it does great injury to a zealous heart, &s;tifling it's warmth, and not &s;uffering it to break out in action. But I hope I &s;hall not make this complaint much longer. I have other hopes that plea&s;e me too, tho' not &s;o well grounded; the&s;e are, that you may yet make a journey we&s;tward with Lord Bathur&s;t; but of the probability of this I do not venture to rea&s;on, becau&s;e I would not part with the plea&s;ure of that belief. It grieves me to think how far I am removed from you, and from that excellent Lord,

<P>I Have a great inclination to write to you, tho' I cannot by writing, any more than I could by words expre&s;s what part I bear in your &s;uffering. Nature and e&s;teem in you are join'd to aggravate your affliction: the latter I have in a degree equal even to yours, and a tye of friend&s;hip approaches near to the tenderne&s;s of nature: yet God knows, no man living is le&s;s fit to comfort you, as no man is more deeply &s;en&s;ible than my &s;elf of the greatne&s;s of the lo&s;s. That very virtue, which &s;ecures his pre&s;ent &s;tate from all the &s;orrows incident to ours, does but aggrandi&s;e our &s;en&s;ation of it's being re|moved from our &s;ight, from our affection
<PB N="163" REF="170">
and from our imitation. The friend&s;hip and &s;ociety of good men does but compleat their felicity before our own, who probably are not yet arriv'd to their degree of perfe|ction which merits an immediate reward. That your dear brother and my dear friend was &s;o, I take his very removal to be a proof; providence would certainly lend vir|tuous men to a world that &s;o much wants them as long as in it's ju&s;tice to them it could &s;pare them to us. May my &s;oul be with tho&s;e who have meant well and have acted well to that meaning; and I doubt not, if this prayer be granted, I &s;hall be with him.

<P>_I A&s;&s;ure you unfeignedly, any memorial of your good-na|ture and friendline&s;s is mo&s;t welcome to me, who know tho&s;e tenders of affection from you, are not like the common traffic of compliments and profe&s;&s;ions, which mo&s;t people only give that they may receive; and is at be&s;t a commerce of Vanity, if not of Fal&s;ehood. I am happy in not immediately wanting the &s;ort of good offices you offer: but if I did want 'em, I &s;hou'd not think my &s;elf unhappy in receiving 'em at your hands: this really is &s;ome compliment, for
<PB N="166" REF="173">
I would rather mo&s;t men did me a &s;mall injury, than a kindne&s;s. I know your hu|manity, and allow me to &s;ay, I love and value you for it: 'Tis a much better ground of love and value, than all the qualities I &s;ee the world &s;o fond of: They generally admire in the wrong place, and generally mo&s;t admire the things they don't compre|hend, or the things they can never be the better for. Very few can receive plea&s;ure or advantage from wit which they &s;eldom ta&s;te, or learning which they &s;eldom under&s;tand: much le&s;s from the quality, high birth, or &s;hining circum&s;tances of tho&s;e to whom they profe&s;s e&s;teem, and who will always remember how much they are their Infe|riors. But Humanity and &s;ociable virtues are what every creature wants every day, and &s;till wants more the longer he lives, and mo&s;t the very moment he dies. It is ill travelling either in a Ditch or on a Terras; we &s;hould walk in the common way, where others are continually pa&s;&s;ing on the &s;ame level, to make the journey of life &s;upport|able by bearing one another company in the &s;ame circum&s;tances.&mdash;Let me know how I may convey over the Ody&s;&s;es for your amu&s;e|ment in your journey, that you many com|pare your own travels with tho&s;e of Uly&s;&s;es: I am &s;ure yours are undertaken upon a more di&s;intere&s;ted, and therefore a more heroic motive. Far be the omen from you, of re|turning

<P>There is lately printed a book<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr WOLLASTON's Religion of Nature deli|neated.</NOTE> wherein all human virtue is reduced to one te&s;t, that of Truth, and branch'd out in every in|&s;tance of our duty to God and man. If you have not &s;een it, you mu&s;t, and I will &s;end it together with the Ody&s;&s;ey. The very women read it, and pretend to be charm'd with that beauty which they gene|rally think the lea&s;t of. They make as much ado about Truth, &s;ince this book ap|pear'd, as they did about Health when Dr Cheyne's came out; and will doubtle&s;s be as con&s;tant in the pur&s;uit of one, as of the other.

<P>I Never am unmindful of tho&s;e I think &s;o well of as your&s;elf; their number is not &s;o great as to confound one's memory. Nor ought you to decline writing to me, upon an imagination that I am much em|ploy'd by other people. For tho' my hou&s;e is like the hou&s;e of a Patriarch of old, &s;tanding by the high-way &s;ide and receiving all travellers, neverthele&s;s I &s;eldom go to bed
<PB N="168" REF="175">
without the reflection, that one's chief bu|&s;ine&s;s is to be really at home: and I agree with you in your opinion of company, amu&s;ements, and all the &s;illy things which mankind would fain make plea&s;ures of, when in truth they are labour and &s;orrow.</P>
<P>I condole with you on the death of your Relation, the E. of C.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Earl of Cadogan, who died July 17, 1726.</NOTE> as on the fate of a mortal man: E&s;teem I never had for him, but concern and humanity I had: the latter was due to the infirmity of his la&s;t period, tho' the former was not due to the trium|phant and vain part of his cour&s;e. He cer|tainly knew him&s;elf be&s;t at la&s;t, and knew be&s;t the little value of others, who&s;e neglect of him whom they &s;o gro&s;sly follow'd and flatter'd in the former &s;cene of his life, &s;hew'd them as worthle&s;s as they could ima|gine him to be, were he all that his wor&s;t enemies believ'd of him. For my own part, I am &s;orry for his death, and wi&s;h he had lived long enough to &s;ee &s;o much of the faithle&s;ne&s;s of the world, as to have been above the mad ambition of governing &s;uch wretches as he mu&s;t have found it to be compos'd of.</P>
<P>Tho' you cou'd have no great value for this Great Man, yet acquaintance it&s;elf, the cu&s;tom of &s;eeing the face, or entring under the roof, of one that walks along with us in
<PB N="169" REF="176">
the common way of the world, is enough to create a wi&s;h at lea&s;t for his being above ground, and a degree of unea&s;ine&s;s at his removal. 'Tis the lo&s;s of an object fami|liar to us: I &s;hould hardly care to have an old po&s;t pull'd up, that I remember'd ever &s;ince I was a child. And add to this the reflection (in the ca&s;e of &s;uch as were not the be&s;t of their Species) what their condition in another life may be, it is yet a more im|portant motive for our concern and com|pa&s;&s;ion. To &s;ay the truth, either in the ca&s;e of death or life, almo&s;t every body and every thing is a cau&s;e or object for huma|nity, even pro&s;perity it&s;elf, and health it|&s;elf, &s;o many weak pitiful incidentals attend on them.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry any relation of yours is ill, whoever it be, for you don't name the per&s;on. But I conclude it is one of tho&s;e to who&s;e hou&s;es you tell me you are going, for I know no invitation with you is &s;o &s;trong as when any one is in di&s;tre&s;s, or in want of your a&s;&s;i&s;tance: The &s;tronge&s;t proof in the world of this, was your at|tendance on the late Earl.</P>
<P>I have been very melancholy for the lo&s;s of Mr Blount. Whoever has any portion of good nature will &s;uffer on the&s;e occa&s;ions, but a good mind rewards it's own &s;ufferings. I hope to trouble you as little as po&s;&s;ible, if it be my fate to go before you. I am

<P>YOU are too humane and con&s;iderate, (things few People can be charged with.) Do not &s;ay you will not expect let|ters from me; upon my word I can no more forbear writing &s;ometimes to you, than thinking often of you. I know the world too well, not to value you; who are an ex|ample of acting, living and thinking, above it, and contrary to it.</P>
<P>I thank God for my Mother's unexpected recovery, tho' my hope can ri&s;e no higher than from reprieve to reprieve, the &s;mall ad|dition of a few days to the many &s;he has al|ready &s;een. Yet &s;o &s;hort and tran&s;itory as this Light is, it is all I have to warm or &s;hine upon me; and when it is out, there is nothing el&s;e that will live for me, or con&s;ume it&s;elf
<PB N="171" REF="178">
in my &s;ervice. But I wou'd have you think this is not the chief motive of my concern about her: Gratitude is a cheap virtue, one may pay it very punctually, for it co&s;ts us no|thing, but our memory of the good done. And I owe her more good, than ever I can pay or &s;he at this age receive, if I could. I do not think the tranquillity of the mind ought to be di&s;turbed for many things in this world; but tho&s;e offices that are nece&s;&s;a|ry duties either to our friends or our &s;elves, will hardly prove any breach of it; and as much as they take away from our indolence and ea&s;e of body, will contribute to our peace and quiet of mind by the content they give. They often afford the highe&s;t plea|&s;ure; and tho&s;e who do not feel that, will hardly ever find another to match it, let them love them&s;elves ever &s;o dearly. At the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be own'd, one meets with cruel di&s;appointments in &s;eeing &s;o often the be&s;t endeavours ineffectual to make o|thers happy, and very often (what is mo&s;t cruel of all) thro' their own means. But &s;till I affirm, tho&s;e very di&s;appointments of a virtuous man are greater plea&s;ures, than the utmo&s;t gratifications and &s;ucce&s;&s;es of a mere &s;elf-lover.</P>
<P>The great and &s;udden event<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">King George I. died June 10, 1727.</NOTE> which has ju&s;t now happened, puts the whole world
<PB N="172" REF="179">
(I mean this whole world) into a new &s;tate: The only u&s;e I have, &s;hall, or wi&s;h to make of it, is to ob&s;erve the Di&s;parity of men from them&s;elves in a weeks time: the de&s;ul|tory leaping and catching of new motions, new modes, new mea&s;ures: and that &s;trange &s;pirit and life, with which men broken and di&s;appointed re&s;ume their hopes, their &s;olli|citations, their ambitions! It would be worth your while, as a Philo&s;opher, to be bu&s;y in the&s;e ob&s;ervations, and to come hither to &s;ee the fury and bu&s;tle of the Bees this hot &s;ea&s;on, without coming &s;o near as to be &s;tung by them.</P>

<P>AFTER the publi&s;hing of my Boyi&s;h Letters to Mr Cromwell, you will not wonder if I &s;hould for&s;wear writing a letter again while I live; &s;ince I do not cor|re&s;pond with a friend upon the terms of any other free &s;ubject of this kingdom. But to you I can never be &s;ilent, or re&s;erved; and I am &s;ure my opinion of your heart is &s;uch, that I could open mine to you in no man|ner which I could fear the whole world &s;hould know. I could publi&s;h my own heart too, I will venture to &s;ay, for any mi&s;chief or malice there's in it; but a little
<PB N="173" REF="180">
too much folly or weakne&s;s might (I fear) appear to make &s;uch a &s;pectacle either in|&s;tuctive or agreeable to others.</P>
<P>I am reduced to beg of all my acquain|tance to &s;ecure me from the like u&s;age for the future, by returning me any Letters of mine which they may have pre&s;erved; that I may not be hurt after my death by that which was the happine&s;s of my life, their partiality and affection to me.</P>
<P>I have nothing of my &s;elf to tell you, on|ly that I have had but indifferent health. I have not made a vi&s;it to London: Curio&s;ity and the love of di&s;&s;ipation dye apace in me. I am not glad nor &s;orry for it, but I am ve|ry &s;orry for tho&s;e who have nothing el&s;e to live on.</P>
<P>I have read much, but writ no more. I have &s;mall hopes of doing good, no vanity in writing, and little ambition to plea&s;e a world not very candid or de&s;erving. If I can pre&s;erve the good opinion of a few friends, it is all I can expect, con&s;idering how little good I can do even them to me|rit it. Few people have your candour, or are &s;o willing to think well of another from whom they receive no benefit, and gratify no vanity. But of all the &s;oft &s;en&s;ations, the greate&s;t plea&s;ure is to give and receive mutual Tru&s;t. It is by Belief and firm Hope, that men are made happy in this life, as well as in the other. My confi|dence
<PB N="174" REF="181">
dence in your good opinion, and dependance upon that of one or two more, is the chief cordial drop I ta&s;te, amid&s;t the In&s;ipid, the Di&s;agreeable, the Cloying, or the Dead|&s;weet, which are the common draughts of life. Some plea&s;ures are too pert, as well as others too flat, to be reli&s;h'd long: and vivacity in &s;ome ca&s;es is wor&s;e than dulne&s;s. Therefore indeed for many years I have not cho&s;en my companions for any of the qua|lities in fa&s;hion, but almo&s;t intirely for that which is the mo&s;t out-of-fa&s;hion, &s;incerity. Before I am aware of it, I am making your panegyrick, and perhaps my own too, for next to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the be&s;t of qualities is the e&s;teeming and di&s;tingui&s;hing tho&s;e who po&s;|&s;e&s;s it.

<P>YOU might well think me negligent or forgetful of you, if true friend&s;hip and &s;incere E&s;teem were to be mea&s;ured by common forms and compliments. The truth is, I could not write then, without &s;ay|ing &s;omething of my own Condition, and of my lo&s;s of &s;o old and &s;o de&s;erving a pa|rent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mrs Pope died the &s;eventh of June, 1733, aged 93.</NOTE>, which really would have troubled you;

or I mu&s;t have kept a &s;ilence upon that head, which would not have &s;uited that freedom and &s;incere opening of the heart which is due to you from me. I am now pretty well; but my home is unea&s;y to me &s;till, and I am therefore wandring about all this &s;ummer. I was but four days at Twiten|ham &s;ince the occa&s;ion that made it &s;o me|lancholy. I have been a fortnight in E&s;&s;ex, and am now at Dawley (who&s;e ma&s;ter is your &s;ervant) and going to Cirence&s;ter to Lord Bathur&s;t. I &s;hall al&s;o &s;ee Southamp|ton with Lord Peterborow. The Court and Twit'nam I &s;hall for&s;ake together. I wi&s;h I did not leave our freind, who de|&s;erves more quiet and more health and hap|pine&s;s, than can be found in &s;uch a family. The re&s;t of my acquaintance are tolerably happy in their various ways of life, whether court, country, or town; and Mr Cleland is as well in the Park, as if he were in Pa|radice. I heartily hope York&s;hire is the &s;ame to you; and that no evil, moral and phy&s;ical, may come near you.</P>
<P>I have now but too much melancholy lei&s;ure, and no other care but to fini&s;h my E&s;&s;ay on Man: There will be in it one line<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Shall burning <HI>Aetna,</HI> if a Sage requires,</L><L>Forget to thunder, and recal her Fires!</L><L>On Air or Sea new motions be impre&s;t,</L><L>O blamele&s;s <HI>Bethel!</HI> to relieve thy brea&s;t?</L></Q></NOTE> that may offend you, (I fear) and yet

I will not alter or omit it, unle&s;s you come to town and prevent me before I print it, which will be in a fortnight in all probabili|ty. In plain truth, I will not deny my &s;elf the greate&s;t plea&s;ure I am capable of receiv|ing, becau&s;e another may have the mode&s;ty not to &s;hare it.

<HEAD>To the Duke of BUCKINGHAM.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">[In an&s;wer to a Letter, in which he inclo&s;ed the De&s;cription of Buckingham-hou&s;e writ|ten by him to the D. of <HI>Shrew&s;bury.</HI>]</HEAD>
<P>PLINY was one of tho&s;e few authors who had a warm hou&s;e over his head, nay, two hou&s;es; as appears by two of his epi&s;tles. I believe if any of his cotempo|rary authors dur&s;t have inform'd the public where they lodg'd, we &s;hould have found the garrets of Rome as well inhabited as tho&s;e of Fleet&s;treet; but 'tis dangerous to let creditors into &s;uch a &s;ecret, therefore we may pre&s;ume that then as well as now-a-days, no body knew where they lived but their book&s;ellers.</P>
<P>It &s;eems, that when Virgil came to Rome, he had no lodgings at all: he fir&s;t introduc'd him&s;elf to Augu&s;tus by an epigram, begin|ning <HI>Noctle pluit tota</HI>&mdash;an ob&s;ervation which probably he had not made, unle&s;s he had lain all night in the &s;treet.</P>
<P>Where Juvenal lived we cannot affirm, but in one of his &s;atires he complains of the exce&s;&s;ive price of lodgings; neither do I
<PB N="184" REF="191">
think he would have talk'd &s;o feelingly of the &s;hortne&s;s of Codrus's bed, if there had been room for a bedfellow in it.</P>
<P>I believe, with all the o&s;tentation of Pli|ny, he would have been glad to have chang'd both his Hou&s;es for your Grace's one; which is a country-hou&s;e in the &s;ummer, and a town-hou&s;e in the winter; and mu&s;t be own'd to be the propere&s;t habitation for a wi&s;e man, who &s;ees all the world change e|very &s;ea&s;on without ever changing him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I have been reading the de&s;cription of Pli|ny's hou&s;e with an eye to yours, but find|ing they will bear no compari&s;on, will try if it can be matched by the large country &s;eat I inhabit at pre&s;ent, and &s;ee what fi|gure it may make, by the help of a florid de&s;cription.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t expect nothing regular in my de&s;cription, any more than in the hou&s;e; the whole va&s;t edifice is &s;o disjointed, and the &s;everal parts of it &s;o detach'd one from the other, and yet &s;o joining again, one can|not tell how, that in one of my poetical fits I imagined it had been a village in Amphi|on's time, where the cottages, having taken a country dance together, had been all out, and &s;tood &s;tone &s;till with amazement ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t excu&s;e me if I &s;ay nothing of the Front, indeed I don't know which it is? A &s;tranger would be grievou&s;ly di&s;appointed
<PB N="185" REF="192">
who endeavour'd to get into this hou&s;e the right way. One would rea&s;onably expect, after the entry throgh the Porch, to be let into the Hall; alas nothing le&s;s! you find your &s;elf in the hou&s;e of office. From the parlour you think to &s;tep into the drawing|room, but upon opening the iron-nail'd door, you are convinc'd by a flight of birds about your ears and a cloud of du&s;t in your eyes, that it is the Pigeon-hou&s;e. If you come into the chapel, you find it's altars like tho&s;e of the Ancients, continually &s;moaking, but it is with the &s;teams of the adjoining kitchen.</P>
<P>The great hall within is high and &s;paci|ous, flank'd on one &s;ide with a very long ta|ble, atrue image of ancient ho&s;pitality: The walls are all over ornamented with mon|&s;trous horns of animals, about twenty bro|ken pikes, ten or a dozen blunderbu&s;&s;es, and a ru&s;ty match-lock mu&s;ket or two, which we were informed had &s;erved in the civil wars. Here is a va&s;t arch'd window beau|tifully darken'd with divers &s;cutchions of painted gla&s;s: one &s;hining pane in particu|lar bears date 1286, which alone pre&s;erves the memory of a Knight who&s;e iron armour is long &s;ince peri&s;h'd with ru&s;t, and who&s;e alaba&s;ter no&s;e is moulder'd from his monu|ment. The face of dame Eleanor in ano|ther piece, owes more to that &s;ingle pane than to all the gla&s;&s;es &s;he ever con&s;ulted in
<PB N="186" REF="193">
her life. After this, who can &s;ay gla&s;s is frail, when it is not half &s;o frail as human beauty, or glory! and yet I can't but &s;igh to think, that the mo&s;t authentic record of &s;o ancient a Family &s;hould lie at the mercy of every boy that flings a &s;tone. In former days, there have dined in this hall garter'd Knights, and courtly Dames, attended by U&s;hers, Sewers, and Sen&ecirc;chals; and yet it was but la&s;t night, that an Owl flew hither and mi&s;took it for a barn.</P>
<P>This hall lets you (up and down) over a very high thre&s;hold into the great parlour. It's contents are a broken-belly'd virginal, a couple of cripled velvet chairs, with two or three mil-dew'd pictures of mouldy ance|&s;tors, who look as di&s;mally, as if they came fre&s;h from hell with all their brim&s;tone a|bout them. The&s;e are carefully &s;et at the farther corner; for the windows being every where broken, make it &s;o convenient a place to dry poppies and mu&s;tard &s;eed, that the room is appropriated to that u&s;e.</P>
<P>Next this parlour, as I &s;aid before, lies the pigeon-hou&s;e, by the &s;ide of which runs an entry, which lets you on one hand or o|ther into a bed-chamber, a buttery, and a &s;mall hole call'd the chaplain's &s;tudy; then follow a brewhou&s;e, a little green and gilt parlour, and the great &s;tairs, under which is the dairy; a little farther on the right the &s;ervants hall, and by the &s;ide of it, up &s;ix
<PB N="187" REF="194">
&s;teps, the old Lady's clo&s;et for her private devotions, which has a lettice into the hall; that at the &s;ame time &s;he pray'd, &s;he might have an eye on the men and maids. There are upon the ground-floor in all twenty &s;ix apartments, among which I mu&s;t not for|get a chamber which has in it a large anti|quity of timber, that &s;eems to have been either a bed&s;tead or a cyder-pre&s;s.</P>
<P>The Kitchen is built in form of a Rotun|da, being one va&s;t Vault to the top of the roof; where the &s;ame aperture &s;erves to let out the &s;moak and let in the light. By the blackne&s;s of the walls, the circular fires, va&s;t cauldrons, yawning mouths of ovens and furnaces, you would think it either the forge of Vulcan, the cave of Polypheme, or the temple of Moloch. The horror of this place has made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on the country people, that they believe the Witches keep their Sabbath here, and that once a year the Devil treats them with infernal ve|ni&s;on, a roa&s;ted Tiger &s;tuff'd with ten-pen|ny nails.</P>
<P>Above &s;tairs we have a number of rooms, you never pa&s;s out of one into another but by the a&s;cent or de&s;cent of two or three &s;tairs. Our be&s;t room is very long and low, of the exact proportion of a Band-box. In mo&s;t of the&s;e there are hangings of the fin|e&s;t work in the world, that is to &s;ay, tho&s;e which Arachne &s;pins from her own bowels:
<PB N="188" REF="195">
Were it not for this only furniture, the whole would be a mi&s;erable &s;cene of naked walls, flaw'd cielings, broken windows, and ru&s;ty locks. The roof is &s;o decay'd, that after a favourable &s;hower we may expect a crop of mu&s;hrooms between the chinks of our floors. All the doors are as little and low as tho&s;e to the cabbins of packet boats. The&s;e rooms have for many years had no o|ther inhabitants than certain Rats who&s;e ve|ry age renders them worthy of this &s;eat, for the very Rats of this venerable hou&s;e are grey: &s;ince the&s;e have not yet quitted it, we hope at lea&s;t that this ancient man&s;ion may not fall during the &s;mall remnant the poor animals have to live, who are now too in|firm to remove to another. There is yet a &s;mall &s;ub&s;i&s;tance left them, in the few re|maining books of the library.</P>
<P>We had never &s;een half what I have de|&s;cribed, but for a &s;tarch'd grey-headed Steward, who is as much an antiquity as any in this place, and looks like an old family pic|ture walk'd out of it's frame. He entertain'd us as we pa&s;s'd from room to room with &s;everal relations of the family; but his ob|&s;ervations were particularly curious when we came to the Cellar. He informed us where &s;tood the triple rows of buts of &s;ack, and where were ranged the bottles of tent, for toa&s;ts in a morning; he pointed to the &s;tands that &s;upported the iron-hoop'd hog|&s;heads
<PB N="189" REF="196">
of &s;trong beer; then &s;tepping to a corner, he lugg'd out the tatter'd fragments of an unframed picture; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This (&s;ays he, with tears) was poor Sir Thomas! once ma&s;ter of all this drink! He had two &s;ons, poor young ma&s;ters! who never ar|rived to the age of his beer; they both fell ill in this very room, and never went out on their own legs."</Q> He could not pa&s;s by a heap of broken bottles without taking up a piece, to &s;how us the Arms of the family upon it. He then led us up the Tower by dark winding &s;tone-&s;teps, which landed us into &s;everal little rooms one above another. One of the&s;e was nail'd up, and our guide whi&s;per'd to us as a &s;ecret the occa&s;ion of it: It &s;eems the cour&s;e of this noble blood was a little interrupted about two centuries ago, by a freak of the lady Frances, who was here taken in the fact with a neigh|bouring Prior, ever &s;ince which the room has been nailed up, and branded with the name of the Adultery-chamber. The gho&s;t of lady Frances is &s;uppo&s;ed to walk there, and &s;ome prying maids of the family report that they have &s;een a lady in a fardingale through the key-hole; but this matter is hu&s;ht up, and the &s;ervants are forbid to talk of it.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t needs have tired you by this long de&s;cription: but what engaged me in it was a generous principle, to pre&s;erve the me|mory
<PB N="190" REF="197">
of that, which it &s;elf mu&s;t &s;oon fall into du&s;t, nay, perhaps part of it before this letter reaches your hands.</P>
<P>Indeed we owe this old hou&s;e the &s;ame kind of gratitude that we do to an old friend, who harbours us in his declining condition, nay, even in his la&s;t extremities. How fit is this retreat for uninterrupted &s;tudy, where no one that pa&s;&s;es by can dream there is an inhabitant? and even tho&s;e who would dine with us dare not &s;tay under our roof? Any one who &s;ees it will own I could not have cho&s;en a more likely place to conver&s;e with the Dead. I had been to blame indeed if I had left your Grace for any one but Homer.

Poor Parnell, before he died, left me the charge of publi&s;hing the&s;e few remains of his: I have a &s;trong de&s;ire to make them, their author, and their publi&s;her, more con&s;iderable, by addre&s;&s;ing and dedi|cating 'em all to you. There is a plea&s;ure in bearing te&s;timony to Truth, and a vanity perhaps, which at lea&s;t is as excu&s;able as any vanity can be.

<P>After all, if your Lord&s;hip will tell my Lord Harley that I mu&s;t not do this, you may depend upon a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the&s;e ver&s;es (the only copy whereof I &s;end you) but you never &s;hall &s;uppre&s;s that great, &s;in|cere, and entire re&s;pect, with which I am always, my Lord,</P>

<P>THE only news you can expect to have from me here, is news from heaven, for I am quite out of the world, and there is &s;carce any thing can reach me ex|cept the noi&s;e of thunder, which undoubted|ly you have heard too. We have read in old authors, of high towers levell'd by it to the ground, while the humble valleys have e&s;cap'd: the only thing that is proof again&s;t it is the Laurel, which however I take to be no great &s;ecurity to the brains of modern authors. But to let you &s;ee that the contrary to this often happens, I mu&s;t acquaint you that the highe&s;t and mo&s;t extravagant heap of towers in the univer&s;e, which is in this neighbourhood, &s;tands &s;till undefac'd, while a cock of barley in our next field has been con&s;umed to a&s;hes. Would to God that this heap of harley had been all that had peri&s;hed! for unhappily beneath this little &s;helter &s;ate two much more con&s;tant Lovers than ever were found in Romance under the &s;hade of a beech-tree. John Hewet was a
<PB N="195" REF="202">
well-&s;et man of about five and twenty; Sarah Drew might be rather called comely than beautiful, and was about the &s;ame age: They had pa&s;s'd thro' the various labours of the year together with the greate&s;t &s;atisfac|tion; if &s;he milk'd, 'twas his morning and evening care to bring the cows to her hand; it was but la&s;t fair that he bought her a pre|&s;ent of green &s;ilk for her &s;traw hat, and the po&s;ie on her &s;ilver ring was of his choo&s;ing. Their love was the talk of the whole neighbourhood; for &s;candal never affirm'd that they had any other views than the lawful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of each other in mar|riage. It was that very morning that he had obtain'd the con&s;ent of her parents, and it was but till the next week that they were to wait to be happy. Perhaps in the inter|vals of their work they were now talking of the wedding cloaths, and John was &s;uit|ing &s;everal &s;orts of poppy's and field flowers to her complection, to chu&s;e her a knot for the wedding-day. While they were thus bu&s;ied, (it was on the la&s;t of July be|tween two or three in the afternoon) the clouds grew black, and &s;uch a &s;torm of lightning and thunder en&s;ued, that all the labourers made the be&s;t of their way to what &s;helter the trees and hedges afforded. Sarah was frightned, and fell down in a &s;woon on a heap of barley. John, who never &s;eparated from her, &s;ate down by her
<PB N="196" REF="203">
&s;ide, having raked together two or three heaps the better to &s;ecure her from the &s;torm. Immediately there was heard &s;o loud a crack, as if heaven had &s;plit a&s;under; every one was &s;olicitous for the &s;afety of his neighbour, and called to one another through|out the field. No an&s;wer being return'd to tho&s;e who called to our Lovers, they &s;tept to the place where they lay; they perceived the barley all in a &s;moak, and then &s;py'd this faithful pair; John with one arm about Sarah's neck, and the other held over her, as to &s;kreen her from the lightning. They were both &s;truck dead in this tender po&s;ture. Sarah's left eye-brow was &s;ing'd, and there appear'd a black &s;pot on her brea&s;t; her Lo|ver was all over black, but not the lea&s;t &s;igns of life were found in either. Attended by their melancholy companions, they were convey'd to the town, and the next day in|terr'd in Stanton-Harcourt Church-yard. My Lord Harcourt, at Mr Pope's and my reque&s;t, has cau&s;ed a &s;tone to be plac'd over them, upon condition that we &s;hould furni&s;h the Epitaph, which is as follows;<Q><L>When Ea&s;tern lovers feed the fun'ral fire,</L>

<P>'TWAS two or three weeks ago that I writ you a letter: I might indeed have done it &s;ooner; I thought of you every po&s;t-day upon that account, and every other day upon &s;ome account or other. I mu&s;t beg you to give Mrs Blount my &s;incere thanks for her kind way of thinking of me, which I have heard of more than once from our friend at court, who &s;eem'd in the letter &s;he writ to be in high health and &s;pirits. Con&s;idering the multiplicity of plea&s;ures and delights that one is over-run with in tho&s;e places, I wonder how any body hath health and &s;pirits enough to &s;upport 'em: I am heartily glad &s;he has, and whenever I hear &s;o, I find it contributes to mine.

<P>YOur letter is a very kind one, but I can't &s;ay &s;o plea&s;ing to me as many of yours have been, thro' the account you give of the dejection of your &s;pirits.

I wi&s;h it partly for my own &s;ake: We have liv'd little together of late, and we want to be phy&s;icians to one another. It was a

I believe we both of us want whetting; there are &s;everal here who will do you that good office, merely for the love of wit, which &s;eems to be bid|ding the town a long and la&s;t adieu. I can tell you of no one thing worth reading, or &s;eeing; the whole age &s;eems re&s;olv'd to ju&s;tify the Dunciad, and it may &s;tand for a public Epitapth or monumental In&s;crip|tion, like that at Thermopylae, on a <HI>whole people peri&s;h'd!</HI> There may indeed be a Wooden image or two of Poetry &s;et up, to pre&s;erve the memory that there once were Bards in Britain; and (like the <HI>Giants</HI> at <HI>Guildhall</HI>) &s;how the bulk and bad ta&s;te of our ance&s;tors: At pre&s;ent the poet Lau|reat and Stephen Duck &s;erve for this pur|po&s;e; a drunken &s;ot of a <HI>Par&s;on</HI> holds forth the emblem of <HI>In&s;piration,</HI> and an hone&s;t indu&s;trious <HI>Thre&s;her</HI> not unaptly repre&s;ents <HI>Pains</HI> and <HI>Labour.</HI> I hope this Phaenome|non of Wilt&s;hire has appear'd at Ame&s;bury, or the Duche&s;s will be thought in&s;en&s;ible to all bright qualities and exalted genius's, in Court and Country alike. But he is a harm|le&s;s man, and therefore I am glad.</P>

with the Thre&s;her, as they do of me. By the way, have you &s;een or convers'd with Mr Chubb, who is a wonderful Phaenome|non of Wilt&s;hire? I have read thro' his whole volume with admiration of the writer: tho' not always with approbation of the doctrine. I have pa&s;t ju&s;t three days in London in four months, two at Wind&s;or, half an one at Richmond, and have not taken one excur&s;ion into any other country.

Mrs Blount de&s;erves your remem|brance, for &s;he never forgets you, and wants nothing of being a friend.</P>

<P>SIR Clem. Cottrell tells me you will &s;hortly come to town. We begin to want comfort, in a few friends about us, while the winds whi&s;tle, and the waters roar. The &s;un gives us a parting look, but 'tis but a cold one; we are ready to change tho&s;e di&s;tant favours of a lofty beauty, for a gro&s;s material fire that warms and comforts more. I wi&s;h you cou'd be here 'till your family come to town: you'll live more in|nocently, and kill fewer harmle&s;s creatures; nay none, except by your proper deputy, the butcher. It is fit for con&s;cience &s;ake, that you &s;hou'd come to town, and that the Duche&s;s &s;hou'd &s;tay in the country, where no innocents of another &s;pecies may &s;uffer by her. I hope &s;he never goes to church: the Duke &s;hou'd lock you both up, and le&s;s harm would be done. I advi&s;e you to make Man your game, hunt and beat about here for coxcombs, and tru&s;s up Rogues in Satire: I fancy they'll turn to a good account, if you can produce them fre&s;h, or make them keep: and their

Here is a dead vacation at pre&s;ent, no politics at court, no trade in town, no|thing &s;tirring but poetry.

<P>I Am at la&s;t return'd from my Somer&s;et|&s;hire expedition, but &s;ince my return I cannot &s;o much boa&s;t of my health as be|fore I went, for I am frequently out of or|der with my colical complaints, &s;o as to make me unea&s;y and di&s;pirited, though not to any violent degree.

Sir William Wyndham is at pre&s;ent amu&s;ing him&s;elf with &s;ome real improvements, and a great many vi&s;ionary ca&s;tles. We were often entertain'd with &s;ea views and &s;ea fi&s;h, and were at &s;ome places in the neighbour|hood, among which I was mightily plea&s;ed with Dun&s;ter Ca&s;tle near Minehead: It &s;tands upon a great eminence, and hath a pro&s;pect of that town, with an exten&s;ive view of the Bri&s;tol Channel; in which are &s;een two &s;mall I&s;lands, call'd the &s;teep Holms and flat Holms, and on t'other &s;ide we could plainly di&s;tingui&s;h the divi&s;ions of fields on the Wel&s;h coa&s;t.

<P>As to your advice about writing Panegy|ric, 'tis what I have not frequently done. I have indeed done it &s;ometimes again&s;t my judgment and inclination, and I heartily re|pent of it.

<P>IT is a true &s;aying that misfortunes alone prove one's friend&s;hips, they &s;how us not only other peoples for us, but our own for them. We hardly know our &s;elves any otherwi&s;e. I feel my being forc'd to this Bath-journey as a misfortune; and to follow my own welfare preferably to tho&s;e I love, is indeed a new thing to me: my health has not u&s;ually got the better of my tenderne&s;&s;es and affections. I &s;et out with a heavy heart, wi&s;hing I had done this thing the la&s;t &s;ea&s;on; for every day I defer it, the more I am in danger of that accident which I dread the mo&s;t, my Mother's death (e&s;pe|cially &s;hould it happen while I am away.) And another Reflection pains me, that I have never &s;ince I knew you been &s;o long &s;eparated from you, as I now mu&s;t be. Methinks we live to be more and more &s;trangers, and every year teaches you to live without me: This ab&s;ence may, I fear, make my return le&s;s welcome and le&s;s wanted to you, than once it &s;eem'd, even after but a fortnight. Time ought not in rea&s;on to dimini&s;h friend&s;hip, when it con|firms the truth of it by experience.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="215">
The journey has a good deal di&s;order'd me, notwith&s;tanding my re&s;ting place at Lord Bathur&s;t's. My Lord is too much for me, he walks and is in &s;pirits all day long: I rejoice to &s;ee him &s;o. It is a right di&s;tin|ction, that I am happier in &s;eeing my friends &s;o many degrees above me, be it fortune, health, or plea&s;ures, than I can be in &s;haring either with them: for in the&s;e &s;ort of en|joyments I cannot keep pace with 'em: any more than I can walk with a &s;tronger man. I wonder to find I am a companion for none but old men, and forget that I am not a young fellow my &s;elf. The wor&s;t is, that reading and writing which I have &s;till the greate&s;t reli&s;h for, are growing painful to my eyes. But if I can pre&s;erve the good opinion of one or two friends, to &s;uch a de|gree, as to have their indulgence to my weakne&s;&s;es, I will not complain of life: And if I could live to &s;ee you con&s;ult your ea&s;e and quiet, by becoming independent on tho&s;e who will never help you to either, I doubt not of finding the latter part of my life plea&s;anter than the former, or pre&s;ent. My unea&s;ine&s;&s;es of mind is in your regard. You have a temper that would make you <HI>ea&s;y</HI> and <HI>beloved,</HI> (which is all the happine&s;s one needs to wi&s;h in this world) and con|tent with moderate things. All your point is not to lo&s;e that Temper by &s;acrificing
<PB N="209" REF="216">
your &s;elf to others, out of a mi&s;taken ten|derne&s;s which hurts you, and profits not them. And this you mu&s;t do &s;oon, or it will be too late: Habit will make it as hard for you to live independent, as for L&mdash; to live out of a Court.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t excu&s;e me for ob&s;erving what I think any defect in you: You grow too in|dolent, and give things up too ea&s;ily: which would be otherwi&s;e, when you found and felt your &s;elf your own: Spirits would come in, as ill-u&s;age went out. While you live under a kind of perpetual dejection and oppre&s;&s;ion, nothing at all belongs to you, not your own <HI>Humour,</HI> nor your own <HI>Sen&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>You can't conceive how much you would find re&s;olution ri&s;e, and chearfulne&s;s grow upon you, if you'd once try to live indepen|dent for two or three months. I never think tenderly of you but this comes acro&s;s me, and therefore excu&s;e my repeating it, for whenever I do not, I di&s;&s;emble half that I think of you: Adieu, pray write, and be particular about your health.</P>

<P>YOU mu&s;t receive my letters with a ju&s;t impartiality, and give grains of allowance for a gloomy or rainy day; I &s;ink grievou&s;ly with the weather-gla&s;s, and am quite &s;piritle&s;s when oppre&s;t with the thoughts of a Birth-day or a Return.</P>
<P>Dutiful affection was bringing me to town, but undutiful lazine&s;s, and being much out of order, keep me in the coun|try; however if alive, I mu&s;t make my ap|pearance at the Birth-day. Where you &s;howed one letter you may &s;how the other; &s;he that never was wanting in any good office in her power, will make a proper ex|cu&s;e, where a &s;in of Omi&s;&s;ion, I fear, is not reckoned as a venial &s;in.</P>

<P>You &s;eem to think it vexatious that I &s;hould allow you but one woman at a time, either to prai&s;e, or love. If I di&s;pute with you upon this point, I doubt every jury will give a verdict again&s;t me: &s;o Sir, with a Mahometan indulgence, I allow you Pluralities, the favourite privilege of our church.</P>
<P>I find you do not mend upon correction; again I tell you, you mu&s;t not think of women in a rea&s;onable way: You know we always make Godde&s;&s;es of tho&s;e we adore upon earth, and do not all the good men tell us, we mu&s;t lay a&s;ide Rea&s;on in what relates to the Deity.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Can never have too many of your let|ters. I am angry at every &s;crap of paper lo&s;t, and tho' it is but an odd com|pliment to compare a fine Lady to a Sybil, your leaves methinks like hers are too good to be committed to the winds, tho' I have no other way of receiving them but by tho&s;e unfaithful me&s;&s;engers. I have had but three, and I reckon that &s;hort one from D----, which was rather a dying ejaculation than a letter.</P>
<P>You contriv'd to &s;ay in your la&s;t the two things mo&s;t plea&s;ing to me: The fir&s;t, that
<PB N="234" REF="241">
whatever be the fate of your letters, you will continue to write in the di&s;charge of your con&s;cience: The other is, the ju&s;tice you do me, in taking what I write to you in the &s;erious manner it was meant. It is the point upon which I can bear no &s;u&s;picion, and in which above all I de&s;ire to be thought &s;erious: It would be vexatious indeed, if you &s;hould pretend to take that for wit, which is no more than the natural over|flowing of a heart improv'd by an e&s;teem for you: but &s;ince you tell me you believe me, I fancy my expre&s;&s;ions have not been entirely unfaithful to my thoughts.</P>
<P>May your faith be increa&s;ed in all truths, that are as great as this, and depend upon it to whatever degree it may extend, you can never be a bigot.</P>
<P>If you could &s;ee the heart I talk of, you would really think it a fooli&s;h good kind of thing, with &s;ome qualities, as well de&s;erving to be half-laughed at and half e&s;teem'd, as mo&s;t hearts in the world.</P>
<P>It's grand <HI>foible</HI> in regard to you, is the mo&s;t like rea&s;on of any <HI>foible</HI> in nature. Upon my word this heart is not like a great warehou&s;e, &s;tored only with my own goods, or with empty &s;paces, to be &s;upply'd as fa&s;t as Intere&s;t or Ambition can fill them: but is every inch of it let out into lodgings for it's friends, and &s;hall never want a corner
<PB N="235" REF="242">
where your idea will always lie as warm, and as clo&s;e, as any idea in Chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>If this di&s;tance (as you are &s;o kind to &s;ay) enlarges your belief of my friend&s;hip, I a&s;&s;ure you it has &s;o extended my notion of your value, that I begin to be impious upon that account, and to wi&s;h that even &s;laughter, ruin, and de&s;olation may inter|po&s;e between you and the place you de&s;ign for; and that you were re&s;tored to us at the expence of a whole people.</P>
<P>Is there no expedient to return you in peace to the bo&s;om of your country? I hear you are come as far as &mdash; do you only look back to die twice? is Eurydice once more &s;natch'd to the &s;hade? If ever mortal had rea&s;on to hate the King, it is I, who&s;e particular misfortune it is, to be almo&s;t the only innocent per&s;on he has made to &s;uffer; both by his Government at home, and his Negotiations abroad.</P>
<P>If you mu&s;t go from us, I wi&s;h at lea&s;t you might pa&s;s to your bani&s;hment by the mo&s;t plea&s;ant way; that all the road might be ro&s;es and myrtles, and a thou&s;and objects ri&s;e round you, agreeable enough to make England le&s;s de&s;irable to you. It is not now my intere&s;t to wi&s;h England agreeable: It is highly probable it may u&s;e me ill enough to drive me from it. Can I think that place my country, where I cannot now call a foot of paternal Earth my own? Yet
<PB N="236" REF="243">

<P>I could overtake you with plea&s;ure in &mdash; and make that tour in your company. Every rea&s;onable entertainment and beautiful view would be doubly engaging when you par|took of it.

And it is not impo&s;&s;ible I might run into A&s;ia in &s;earch of liberty; for who would not rather live a freeman among a nation of &s;laves, than a &s;lave among a nation of freemen?</P>
<P>In good earne&s;t if I knew your motions, and your exact time; I verily think I &s;hould be once more happy in a &s;ight of you next &s;pring.</P>

<P>THE weather is too fine for any one that loves the country to leave it at this &s;ea&s;on; when every &s;mile of the &s;un, like the &s;mile of a coy lady, is as dear as it is uncommon: and I am &s;o much in the ta&s;te of rural plea&s;ures, I had rather &s;ee the &s;un than any thing he can &s;hew me, except your&s;elf. I de&s;pi&s;e every fine thing in town, not excepting your new gown, till I &s;ee you dre&s;s'd in it (which by the way I don't like the better for the red; the leaves I think are very pretty.) I am growing fit, I hope, for a better world, of which the light of the &s;un is but a &s;hadow: for I doubt not but Gods works here, are what comes neare&s;t to his works there; and that a true reli&s;h of the beauties of nature is the mo&s;t ea&s;y preparation and gentle&s;t tran&s;ition to an enjoyment of tho&s;e of heaven; as on the contrary a true town life of hurry, con|fu&s;ion, noi&s;e, &s;lander, and di&s;&s;en&s;ion, is a &s;ort of apprentice&s;hip to hell and it's furies. I'm endeavouring to put my mind into as quiet a &s;ituation as I can, to be ready to receive that &s;troke which I believe is coming upon me, and have fully re&s;ign'd
<PB N="240" REF="245" MS="y">
my &s;elf to yield to it. The &s;eparation of my &s;oul and body is what I could think of with le&s;s pain; for I am very &s;ure he that made it will take care of it, and in what|ever &s;tate he plea&s;es it &s;hall be, that &s;tate mu&s;t be right: But I cannot think without tears of being &s;eparated from my friends, when their condition is &s;o doubtful, that they may want even &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance as mine. Sure it is more merciful to take from us after death all memory of what we lov'd or pur|&s;u'd here: for el&s;e what a torment would it be to a &s;pirit, &s;till to love tho&s;e creatures it is quite divided from? Unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e, that in a more exalted life, all that we e&s;teem'd in this imperfect &s;tate will affect us no more, than what we lov'd in our in|fancy concerns us now.</P>
<P>This is an odd way of writing to a lady, and I'm &s;en&s;ible would throw me under a great deal of ridicule, were you to &s;how this letter among your acquaintance. But per|haps you may not your &s;elf be quite a &s;tranger to this way of thinking. I heartily wi&s;h your life may be &s;o long and &s;o happy, as never to let you think <HI>quite &s;o far,</HI> as I am now led to do; but to think <HI>a little towards it,</HI> is what will make you the happier and the ea&s;ier at all times.</P>
<P>There are no plea&s;ures, or amu&s;ements, that I don't wi&s;h you, and therefore 'tis no &s;mall grief to me that I &s;hall for the future be

le&s;s able to partake with you in them. But let Fortune do her wor&s;t, whatever &s;he makes us lo&s;e, as long as &s;he never makes us lo&s;e our hone&s;ty and our independence; I de&s;pi&s;e from my heart whoever parts with the fir&s;t, and I pity from my &s;oul who|ever quits the latter.</P>
<P>I am griev'd at Mr GAY's condition in this la&s;t re&s;pect of dependence. He has Merit, good Nature, and Integrity, three qualities that I fear are too often lo&s;t upon great men; or at lea&s;t are not all three a match for that one which is oppos'd to them, Flattery. I wi&s;h it may not &s;oon or late di&s;place him from the favour he now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, and &s;eems to like.</P>

<P>ALL the plea&s;ure or u&s;e of familiar let|ters, is to give us the a&s;&s;urance of a friend's welfare; at lea&s;t 'tis all I know, who am a mortal enemy and de&s;pi&s;er of what they call fine letters. In this view I promi&s;e you, it will always be a &s;atisfaction to me to write letters and to receive them from you; becau&s;e I unfeignedly have your good at my heart, and am that thing, which many people make only a &s;ubject to di&s;play their fine &s;entiments upon, a Friend: which is a character that admits of little to be &s;aid, 'till &s;omething may be done. Now let me fairly tell you, I don't like your &s;tyle: 'tis very pretty, therefore I don't like it; and if you writ as well as Voiture, I wou'd not give a farthing for &s;uch letters, unle&s;s I were to &s;ell 'em to be printed.

To &s;hew you how very un&s;atisfactorily you write, in all your letters you've never told me how you did? Indeed I &s;ee 'twas ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for me to write to you, before you continu'd to take more notice of me, for I ought to tell you what you are to expect; that is to &s;ay, Kindne&s;s, which I never fail'd (I hope) to return; and not Wit, which if I want, I am not much concern'd, becau&s;e judg|ment is a better thing; and if I had, I wou'd make u&s;e of it rather to play upon tho&s;e I de&s;pis'd, than to trifle with tho&s;e I loved.

<P>I Am extreamly oblig'd to you for taking notice of a poor old di&s;tre&s;&s;ed courtier, commonly the mo&s;t de&s;pi&s;eable thing in the world. This blow has &s;o rous'd <HI>Scriblerus</HI> that he has recover'd his &s;en&s;es, and thinks and talks like other men. From being fro|lick&s;ome and gay he is turn'd grave and moro&s;e. His lucubrations lye neglected a|mong&s;t old news-papers, ca&s;es, petitions, and abundance of unan&s;werable letters. I wi&s;h to God they had been among&s;t the papers of a noble Lord<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Earl of <HI>Sunderland.</HI></NOTE> &s;ealed up.

<P>I A&s;&s;ure you I am glad of your letter, and have long wanted nothing but the per|mi&s;&s;ion you now give me, to be plain and unre&s;erved upon this head. I wrote to you concerning it long &s;ince; but a friend of yours and mine was of opinion, it was ta|king too much upon me, and more than I cou'd be entitled to by the mere merit of long acquaintance, and good will. I have not a thing in my heart relating to any friend, which I would not, in my own na|ture, declare to all mankind. The truth is

what you gue&s;s; I could not e&s;teem your con|duct, to an object of mi&s;ery &s;o near you as Mrs &mdash; and I have often hinted it to your &s;elf: The truth is, I cannot yet e&s;teem it for any rea&s;on I am able to &s;ee. But this I promi&s;e, I acquit you as far as your own mind acquits you. I have now no farther cau&s;e of complaint for the unhappy lady gives me now no farther pain; &s;he is no longer an object either of yours, or my compa&s;&s;ion; the hard&s;hips done her, are lodg'd in the hands of God, nor has any man more to do in them, except the per|&s;ons concern'd in occa&s;ioning them.</P>
<P>As for the interruption of our Corre&s;pon|dence, I am &s;orry you &s;eem to put the Te&s;t of my friend&s;hip upon that, becau&s;e it is what I am di&s;qualify'd from toward my o|ther acquaintance, with whom I cannot hold any frequent Commerce. I'll name you the ob&s;tacles which I can't &s;urmount: want of health, want of time, want of good eyes; and one yet &s;tronger than all, I write not upon the terms of other men. For however glad I might be, of expre&s;|&s;iug my re&s;pect, opening my mind, or vent|ing my concerns to my private friends; I hardly dare, while there are <HI>Curlls</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Which in all Probability may be as long as there are POPES.</NOTE> in the World. If you plea&s;e to reflect either on the impertinence of weak admirers, the ma|lice

of low enemies, the avarice of merce|nary Book&s;ellers, or the &s;illy curio&s;ity of people in general; you'll confe&s;s I have &s;mall rea&s;on to indulge corre&s;pondencies: in which too I want materials, as I live al|together out of town, and have ab&s;tracted my mind (I hope) to better things than common news. I wi&s;h my friends wou'd &s;end me back tho&s;e forfeitures of my di&s;cre|tion, commit to my ju&s;tice what I tru&s;ted only to their indulgence, and return me at the years End tho&s;e trifling letters which can be to them but a days amu&s;ement, but to me may prove a di&s;credit as la&s;ting and exten&s;ive, as the afore&s;aid weak admirers, mean enemies, mercenary &s;criblers, or cu|rious &s;impletons, can make it.</P>
<P>I come now to a particular you complain of, my not an&s;wering your que&s;tion about &s;ome Party Papers, and their Authors. This indeed I could not tell you, becau&s;e I never was, or will be privy to &s;uch Papers: And if by accident thro' my acquaintance with any of the writers, I had known a thing they conceal'd; I &s;hould certainly never be the Reporter of it.</P>
<P>For my waiting on you at your country hou&s;e, I have often wi&s;h'd it; it was my compliance to a &s;uperior duty that hinder'd me, and one which you are too good a chri&s;tian to wi&s;h I &s;hou'd have broken, having never ventur'd to leave my mother
<PB N="247" REF="254">
(at her great age) for more than a week, which is too little for &s;uch a journey.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I mu&s;t acquit my&s;elf of any act or thought in prejudice to the regard I owe you, as &s;o long and obliging an acquaintance and corre&s;pondent. I am &s;ure I have all the good wi&s;hes for your&s;elf and your family, that become a friend: There is no accident that can happen to your advantage, and no action that can re|dound to your credit, which I &s;hould not be ready to extol, or to rejoice in.

<P>LETTERS AND POEMS, AMOROUS AND GALLANT, By WILLIAM WALSH, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></P>
</DIV1>

<PB REF="266">
<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_IT has been &s;o u&s;ual among mo|dern Authors to write Prefaces, that a Man is thought rude to his Reader, who does not give him &s;ome Account before hand of what he is to expect in the Book. That which may make &s;omewhat of this kind more nece&s;|&s;ary in my Ca&s;e, than others is, That a great part of this Collection con&s;i&s;ts of Familiar Letters, which &s;ort of Writing &s;ome Learned Per&s;ons among us have thought unfit to be publi&s;hed. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed indeed, that a great Beauty of Letters does often con&s;i&s;t in little Pa&s;&s;ages of private Conver&s;ation, and Re|ferences to particular Matters, that can be un|der&s;tood by none but tho&s;e to whom they are written: But to draw a general Conclu&s;ion from thence, That familiar Letters can plea&s;e none, but tho&s;e very Per&s;ons, is to conclude again&s;t the common Experience of all the World; &s;ince be&s;ides the great Applau&s;es have been giv|en the Letters of <HI>Cicero</HI> and <HI>Pliny</HI> among the <HI>Romans,</HI> we &s;ee no Book has been better re|ceived among the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> than the Letters
<PB N="iv" REF="267">
of <HI>Guevare;</HI> or, among the <HI>French,</HI> than tho&s;e of <HI>Voiture</HI> and <HI>Bal&s;ac:</HI> Not to mention the <HI>Ita|lians,</HI> among whom there has been hardly any con&s;iderable Man, who has not publi&s;hed Let|ters with good Succe&s;s. What may have con|tributed very much to the kind Reception the&s;e things have met, is, that there is no &s;ort of Writing &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for People to under&s;tand as this: A Man may have a great deal of Wit, without being able to write Ver&s;es, or make Harangues; and may live in very good Re|pute, without having occa&s;ion of doing either. But a Man can hardly live in the World, without being able to write Letters. There is no State of Life in which a Faculty of that kind is not requi&s;ite; and there are few Days pa&s;s, in which a Man has not occa&s;ion to make u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>The Stile of Letters ought to be free, ea&s;y and natural: As near approaching to Familiar Conver&s;ation as po&s;&s;ible. The two be&s;t Qua|lities in Conver&s;ation, are good Humour and good Breeding; tho&s;e Letters are therefore certainly the be&s;t that &s;hew the mo&s;t of tho&s;e two Qualities. There are &s;ome Men &s;o &s;urly, &s;o ill-natured, and &s;o ill-bred, that tho' we can hardly deny them to have Wit, yet we can &s;ay, at lea&s;t, that we are &s;orry they have it. And indeed, as their Wit is trouble&s;ome to other People, &s;o I can hardly imagine of what great U&s;e it can be to them&s;elves. For if the End of Wit be not to render one's &s;elf agreeable, I &s;hall &s;carce envy them any other U&s;e they can make of it.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="268">
The Second Part of this Collection con&s;i&s;ts of Amorous Ver&s;es. Tho&s;e who are conver|&s;ant with the Writings of the Ancients, will ob&s;erve a great Difference between what they and the Moderns have publi&s;hed upon this Sub|ject. The Occa&s;ions upon which the Poems of the former are written, are &s;uch as happen to every Man almo&s;t that is in Love; and the Thoughts &s;uch as are natural for every Man in Love to think. The Moderns, on the other hand, have &s;ought out for Occa&s;ions, that none meet with but them&s;elves; and fill their Ver&s;es with Thoughts that are &s;urprizing and glitter|ing, but not tender, pa&s;&s;ionate, or natural, to a Man in Love.</P>
<P>To judge which of the&s;e two are in the right, we ought to con&s;ider the End that People pro|po&s;e in writing Love-Ver&s;es: And that I take not to be the getting Fame or Admiration from the World, but the obtaining the Love of their Mi&s;tre&s;s; and the be&s;t Way I conceive to make her love you, is to convince her that you love her. Now this certainly is not to be done by forced Conceits, far fetched Similes, and &s;hining Points; but by a true and lively Repre&s;entation of the Pains and Thoughts at|tending &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;ion.<Q><L>Si vis me flere, dolendum e&s;t</L>
<L>Primum ip&s;i tibi, tunc tua me infortunia laedent.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="269">
I would as &s;oon believe a Widow in great Grief for her Hu&s;band, becau&s;e I &s;aw her dance a <HI>Corant</HI> about his Coffin, as believe a Man in Love with his Mi&s;tre&s;s for his wri|ting &s;uch Ver&s;es, as &s;ome great Modern Wits have done upon theirs.</P>
<P>I am &s;atisfied that <HI>Catullus, Tibullus, Pro|pertius,</HI> and <HI>Ovid,</HI> were in love with their Mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es, while they upbraid them, quarrel with them, threaten them, and for&s;wear them; but I confe&s;s I cannot believe <HI>Petrarch</HI> in Love with his, when he writes Conceits upon her Name, her Gloves, and the Place of her Birth. I know it is natural for a Lover in Tran&s;ports of Jealou&s;y to treat his Mi&s;tre&s;s with all the Violence imaginable; but I cannot think it natural for a Man, who is much in Love, to amu&s;e him&s;elf with &s;uch Trifles as the other. I am plea&s;ed with <HI>Tibullus,</HI> when he &s;ays, <HI>he could live in a De&s;art with his Mi&s;tre&s;s, where never any Human Foot&s;teps appeared;</HI> becau&s;e I doubt not but he really thinks what he &s;ays; but I confe&s;s I can hardly forbear laughing when <HI>Petrarch</HI> tells us, <HI>he could live without any other Su&s;tenance than his Mi&s;tre&s;s's Looks.</HI> I can very ea&s;ily believe a Man may love a Woman &s;o well, <HI>as to de&s;ire no Company but hers;</HI> but I can never believe a Man can love a Woman &s;o well, <HI>as to have no need of Meat and Drink, if he may look upon her.</HI> The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> is a Thought &s;o natural for a <HI>Lover,</HI> that there is no <HI>Man</HI> really in <HI>Love,</HI> but thinks the &s;ame
<PB N="vii" REF="270">
thing; the <HI>other</HI> is not the Thought of a <HI>Man</HI> in <HI>Love,</HI> but of a Man who would impo&s;e upon us with a <HI>pretended Love</HI> (and that indeed very gro&s;ly too) while he had really <HI>none at all.</HI></P>
<P>It would be endle&s;s to pur&s;ue this Point; and any Man, who will but give him&s;elf the Trouble to compare what the Ancients and Mo|derns have &s;aid upon the &s;ame Occa&s;ions, will &s;oon perceive the Advantage the <HI>former</HI> have over the <HI>others.</HI> I have cho&s;en to mention <HI>Petrarch</HI> only, as being, by much, the mo&s;t famous of all the Moderns who have written Love-Ver&s;es: And it is, indeed, the great Reputation which he has gotten, that has giv|en Encouragement to this fal&s;e &s;ort of Wit in the World: For People &s;eeing the great Cre|dit he had, and has, indeed, to this Day, not only in <HI>Italy,</HI> but over all <HI>Europe,</HI> have &s;a|tisfied them&s;elves with the Imitation of him, never enquiring whether the Way he took was the right or not.</P>
<P>There are no Modern Writers perhaps who have &s;ucceeded better in <HI>Love-Ver&s;es</HI> than the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and it is indeed ju&s;t, that the <HI>faire&s;t Ladies</HI> &s;hould in&s;pire the <HI>be&s;t Poets.</HI> Never was there a more copious Fancy, or greater reach of Wit, than what appears in Dr. <HI>Donne;</HI> nothing can be more gallant or genteel than the Poems of Mr. <HI>Waller;</HI> nothing more gay or &s;prightly than tho&s;e of Sir <HI>John Suckling;</HI> and nothing fuller of Variety and Learning than Mr. <HI>Cowley</HI>'s. However, it may be ob&s;erved,
<PB N="viii" REF="271">
that among all the&s;e, <HI>that</HI> Softne&s;s, Tender|ne&s;s, and Violence of Pa&s;&s;ion, which the <HI>An|cients</HI> thought mo&s;t proper for <HI>Love-Ver&s;es,</HI> is wanting; and at the &s;ame time that we mu&s;t al|low Dr. <HI>Donne</HI> to have been a <HI>very great Wit;</HI> Mr. <HI>Waller</HI> a very <HI>gallant</HI> Writer; Sir <HI>John Suckling</HI> a very <HI>gay</HI> one, and Mr. <HI>Cowley</HI> a <HI>great</HI> Genius; yet methinks I can hardly fancy any one of them to have been a <HI>very great Lover.</HI> And it grieves me that the <HI>Ancients,</HI> who could never have hand&s;omer Women, than <HI>we</HI> have, &s;hould neverthele&s;s be &s;o much more in Love than we are. But it is proba|ble, the great Rea&s;on of this may be the Cru|elty of our Ladies; for a Man mu&s;t be im|prudent indeed to let his Pa&s;&s;ion take very deep root, when he has no Rea&s;on to expect any &s;ort of Return to it. And if it be &s;o, there ought to be a Petition made to the Fair, that they would be plea&s;ed &s;ometimes to abate a little of their Rigour for the Propagation of good Ver&s;e. I do not mean, that they &s;hould confer their Favours upon none but Men of Wit: That would be too great a Confine|ment indeed: But that they would admit them upon the &s;ame Foot with other People; and if they plea&s;e now and then to make the Ex|periment, I fancy they will find Entertain|ment enough from the very Variety of it.</P>
<P>There are three &s;orts of Poems that are proper for Love: <HI>Pa&s;torals, Elegies,</HI> and <HI>Lyric</HI> Ver&s;es, under which la&s;t I comprehend all <HI>Songs, Odes, Sonnets, Madrigals</HI> and
<PB N="ix" REF="272">
<HI>Stanzas.</HI> Of all the&s;e, <HI>Pa&s;toral</HI> is the lowe&s;t, and upon that account perhaps mo&s;t proper for Love; &s;ince it is the Nature of that Pa&s;|&s;ion to render the Soul &s;oft and humble. The&s;e three &s;orts of Poems ought to differ, not only in their Numbers, but in the De|&s;igns, and in every Thought of them. Tho' we have no Difference between the Ver&s;es of <HI>Pa&s;toral</HI> and <HI>Elegy</HI> in the Modern Languages, yet the Numbers of the fir&s;t ought to be loo&s;er, and not &s;o &s;onorous, as the other; the Thoughts more &s;imple, more ea&s;ie, and more humble. The De&s;ign ought to be the repre|&s;enting the Life of a Shepherd, not only by talking of Sheep and Fields, but by &s;hewing us the Truth, Sincerity and Innocence that accompanies that &s;ort of Life. For tho' I know our Ma&s;ters, <HI>Theocritus</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> have not always conformed in this Point of Inno|cence; <HI>Theocritus</HI> in his <HI>Daphnis,</HI> having made his Love too wanton, and <HI>Virgil</HI> in his <HI>Alexis,</HI> placed his Pa&s;&s;ion upon a Boy; yet (if we may be allowed to <HI>cen&s;ure</HI> tho&s;e whom we mu&s;t always <HI>reverence</HI>) I take both tho&s;e things to be Faults in their Poems, and &s;hould have been better plea&s;ed with the <HI>Alexis,</HI> if it had been made to a Woman; and with the <HI>Daphnis,</HI> if he had made his Shepherds more mode&s;t. When I give Humility and Mode&s;ty as the Character of <HI>Pa&s;toral,</HI> it is not, however, but that a Shepherd may be allowed to boa&s;t of his Pipe, his Songs, his Flocks, and to &s;hew a Contempt of his Ri|val, as we &s;ee both <HI>Theocritus</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> do.

<PB N="ix" REF="274">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="x" REF="275">
But this mu&s;t be &s;till in &s;uch a manner, as if the Occa&s;ion offered it&s;elf, and was not &s;ought, and proceeded rather from the Violence of the Shepherd's Pa&s;&s;ion, than any natural Pride or Maliee in him.</P>
<P>There ought to be the &s;ame Difference ob|&s;erv'd between <HI>Pa&s;torals</HI> and <HI>Eligies,</HI> as be|tween the Life of the Country and the Court. In the fir&s;t, Love ought to be repre&s;ented as among Shepherds, in the other as among Gen|tlemen. They ought to be &s;mooth, clear, tender and pa&s;&s;ionate. The Thoughts may be bold, more gay, and more elevated than in <HI>Pa&s;toral.</HI> The Pa&s;&s;ions they repre&s;ent, ei|ther more Gallant or more Violent, and le&s;s innocent than the others. The Subjects of them, Prayers, Prai&s;es, Expo&s;tulations, Quar|rels, Reconcilements, Threatnings, Jealou&s;ies, and, in fine, all the natural Effects of Love.</P>
<P><HI>Lyrics</HI> may be allowed to handle all the &s;ame Subjects with Elegy; but to do it how|ever in a different manner. An Elegy ought to be &s;o entirely <HI>one thing,</HI> and every Ver&s;e ought &s;o to depend upon the <HI>other,</HI> that they &s;hould not be able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t <HI>alone:</HI> Or, to make u&s;e of the Words of a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">My Lord <HI>Mulgrave.</HI></NOTE> great Modern Critic, there mu&s;t be<Q><L>&mdash;a ju&s;t Coherence made</L>
<L>Between each Thought, and the whole Model laid</L>
<L>So right, that every Step may higher ri&s;e,</L>
<L>Like goodly Mountains, till they reach the Skies.</L></Q> <PB N="xi" REF="276">
<HI>Lyrics,</HI> on the other hand, tho' they ought to make one Body as well as <HI>Elegy,</HI> yet may con&s;i&s;t of Parts that are intire of them|&s;elves. It being a Rule in Modern Lan|guages, that every <HI>Stanza</HI> ought to make up a compleat Sen&s;e, without running into the other. Frequent Sentences, which are ac|counted Faults in <HI>Elegies,</HI> are Beauties here. Be&s;ides this, <HI>Malherb,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> Poets after him, have made it a Rule in the <HI>Scanzas</HI> of Six Lines, to make a Pau&s;e at the third; and in tho&s;e of Ten Lines, at the Third and the Seventh. And it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that this Exactne&s;s renders them much more Mu&s;i|&s;ical and Harmonious; tho' they have not al|ways been &s;o Religious in ob&s;erving the lat|ter Rule as the former.</P>
<P>But I am engaged in a very vain, or a very fooli&s;h De&s;ign: Tho&s;e who are Criticks, it would be a Pre&s;umption in me to pretend I could in&s;truct, tho&s;e who are not, at the &s;ame time I write my&s;elf, is (if I may be allowed to apply another Man's Simile) like <HI>&s;elling Arms to an Enemy in time of War.</HI> Though there ought, perhaps, to be more Indulgence &s;hewn to things of Love and Gallantry, than any others; becau&s;e they are generally writ|ten when People are young, and intended for Ladies who are not &s;uppo&s;ed to be very old; and all young People, e&s;pecially of the Fair Sex, are more taken with the Liveline&s;s of Fancy, than the Correctne&s;s of Judgment. It may be al&s;o ob&s;erved, that to write of Love
<PB N="xii" REF="277">
well, a Man mu&s;t be really in Love; and to correct his Writings well, he mu&s;t be out of Love again. I am well enough &s;atisfied, I may be in Circum&s;tances of writing of Love; but I am almo&s;t in De&s;pair of ever being in Circum&s;tances of correcting it. This I hope may be a Rea&s;on for the Fair and the Young, to pa&s;s over &s;ome of the Faults; and as for the Grave and Wi&s;e, all the Favour I &s;hall beg of them is, that they would not read them; Things of this Nature are calculated only for the former. If Love-Ver&s;es work upon the Ladies, a Man will not trouble him&s;elf with what the Criticks &s;ay of them; and if they do not, all the Commendations the Criticks can give him, will make but very little a|mends. All I &s;hall &s;ay for the&s;e Trifles is, That I pretend not to vie with any Man what|&s;oever. I doubt not but there are &s;everal now living, who are able to write better upon all Subjects, than I am upon any one: But I will take the Boldne&s;s to &s;ay, <HI>That there is no One Man among them All who &s;hall be readier to acknowledge his Own Faults, or to do Ju&s;tice to the Merits of Other People,</HI></P>

<P>_THO' I cannot boa&s;t much of Particularity to the Per&s;on I love, yet as to the Love it &s;elf, I may &s;afely &s;ay, It is one of the mo&s;t particular under the Sun. Others think it enough to fall in Love with a Lady after having &s;een her. I am in Love with <HI>two,</HI> without having ever &s;een <HI>ei|ther:</HI> Not that I would willingly admit <HI>two</HI> Tyrants into my Heart; but tho' <HI>one</HI> of you may perhaps be Monarch there, yet neither you nor I knowing which it is, the Matter mu&s;t re&s;t in doubt till another Opportunity.

<P>IT is by <HI>Faith</HI> alone that I fancy you the mo&s;t Charming, but I find by <HI>Experience</HI> you are one of the mo&s;t unrea&s;onable Ladies under the Sun. I concluded I had done the bolde&s;t Action in the World, to declare a Pa&s;&s;ion to <HI>two</HI> Ma&s;ques; but you, Madam, &s;et up a Title of your own, and are not &s;ati&s;|fied without Particularity, and Con&s;tancy. Your Charms, I confe&s;s, Madam, as far as I &s;aw of them, are very great: The Ma&s;que was very good <HI>Genoa</HI> Velvet; the Gloves ve|ry good <HI>Blois</HI> Gloves, and the Hackney-Coach, for aught I know, lined with very good green Plu&s;h. Now, Madam, though &s;o far I do &s;tedfa&s;tly <HI>believe,</HI> yet to fall con|&s;tantly and particularly in Love with Ma&s;ques, Gloves, or Hackney-Coaches, is what I do not find a Precedent for, in any of the <HI>French</HI> Romances; and being naturally diffident of my&s;elf, I &s;hould be loth to begin a new &s;ort of Gallantry, without knowing how it would take. Con&s;ider, Madam, a little better upon the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of your Reque&s;t; for Par|ticularity and Con&s;tancy are very hardly to be an&s;wered for, at our Years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Author's Age about 32.</NOTE>. It is, I doubt not, Madam, in your Power to blow my Love up to that Height whenever you plea&s;e; and to confe&s;s a Truth to you, I have

a very great Stock of Particularity and Con|&s;tancy lying upon my Hands at this Time, and know not how to apply it. I have all the Rea&s;on in the World to imagine it is kept for you; but however, Madam, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to have one View of you, before I can be po&s;itive in that Point. I am &s;atisfied in my Con&s;cience that I have done all my Duty in the Thing; let it lye at your Door if the Humour break off; for my part I can|not imagine how you will be able to an&s;wer it to all the World, if you &s;hould, for want of di&s;covering your&s;elf, lo&s;e the mo&s;t con&s;tant and mo&s;t faithful Lover under the Sun.</P>

I grant you, Madam, it is a pretty A&euml;real &s;ort of Beauty, and may do very well for Spiritual Lovers; but for me, Madam, who am a little embarra&s;&s;ed with Matter, and who generally carry a Body of Six Foot long about with me, it would be convenient to have &s;ome more Corporeal Accompli&s;hents.

<P>YES really, Madam, I think you are in the right of it; Hanging and Drown|ing are &s;uch vulgar Ways of dying, that for my part I would rather live a thou&s;and Years, than make u&s;e of either. Then, Madam, they are the mo&s;t inconvenient Methods in the World; Drowning will &s;poil your Cloaths, and Hanging your Complexion; be&s;ides &s;everal other things that might be &s;aid to di&s;&s;uade you from it, but that I know a Word to the

But to be le&s;s &s;erious, Madam, make no doubt of your own Perfections, and reckon that in having me, you have the mo&s;t rea&s;onable Lover, of an unrea&s;onable Lover, in the World.

<P>ST. <HI>Jerome</HI> &s;ays, (St. <HI>Jerome,</HI> I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, is a verv odd Beginning of a Billet <HI>doux</HI>) That a Man who can with Patience &s;uf|fer him&s;elf to be called Heretick, ought not to be e&s;teemed a good Chri&s;tian: And in common Account you &s;ee, one who is called Coward, if he does not re&s;ent the Affront, &s;hall always be thought &s;uch. As my Pro|vocations are much greater than either of the&s;e, &s;o if my Indignation were an&s;werable to them, you could not expect to be forgiven by me, even in the Article of Death: For after all People can &s;ay of Hereticks and Cowards, they will allow them to be Men; but by your Reflections upon me, you would degrade me from that Rank, without allow|ing me any Place among the inferiour Crea|tures. Had you called me Brute or Bea&s;t, I had not been &s;o zealous in my own Ju&s;tifica|tion: Daily Experience convinces us, That Men who have no more Under&s;tanding than Hor&s;es, or Mules, provided they have all the other Qualifications of tho&s;e noble Animals, may be acceptable enough to &s;ome or other of the Fair Sex; but want of Virility is an Imputation that will cut a Man off from all &s;ort of Communication with them. Had the Husbands or Old Women had this Opinion of me, I &s;hould not have been &s;o violent in

my own Defence. Scandals, as well as Oaths, ought to be taken in the Sen&s;e of tho&s;e that impo&s;e them: I &s;hould not be angry at a <HI>Turk,</HI> or a <HI>Jew,</HI> for thinking me of their Religion; becau&s;e, whatever I thought, it was what made them like me the better; but this would be no Rea&s;on to make me forgive a Chri&s;tian for calling me &s;o. In like man|ner, Madam, though I could have pardoned the Husbands and Old Women for &s;aying &s;uch a Thing of me, yet I can very hardly pardon you for it. It were in vain to call Witne&s;&s;es in this Ca&s;e, or turn you over to another Hand for Satisfaction in that Point, which can only properly be re&s;olved by my &s;elf; and it were as vain to think to clear my&s;elf by Words from an Imputatian that ought to be done by Actions; I &s;hall therefore only challenge you to meet me at your own Place and Time; where I doubt not to give you full Satisfac|tion in this Point, and convince you that I am not the Man (or rather indeed the no-Man) that you take me to be.

I do not expect you &s;hould write me a Letter in return to this, and therefore venture it without a Name: It is from your Eyes alone, I &s;hall attend my An&s;wer. But, Madam, that we may not mi&s;take one another in this Point, and that I may not take for an Encouragement of my Pa&s;&s;ion, what you intend for a Di&s;cou|ragement of it; I mu&s;t tell you, That if you do not look upon me after this, I &s;hall be|lieve you are in Love, and that makes you ba&s;hful: If you look angrily, I &s;hall think it is to give me occa&s;ion to come and ju&s;tify my &s;elf; and if you look negligently, I &s;hall con|clude it is Management to di&s;gui&s;e the Amour from the World: In fine, Madam, I &s;hall take nothing for a Refu&s;al of my Heart, but looking very kindly upon me. But that you may not be mi&s;taken in the Per&s;on who &s;ends this, and imagine it to come from &s;ome Lord wich a Blue Garter, or White Staff, it comes from a Commoner without either: I will de&s;|cribe my &s;elf &s;o, as you may know me well enough to encourage my Pa&s;&s;ion, if you like

<P>THERE may have been other Men, per|haps, be&s;ides my &s;elf, who have fallen in Love with a Woman they did not know; but for a Man to do it for no other rea&s;on than her declaring again&s;t him, is, I believe, an Honour that has been re&s;erved for your hum|ble Servant. They tell me, Madam, you
<PB N="12" REF="289">
are &s;o far from liking me your &s;elf, that you will not believe any body el&s;e can: That you find nothing agreeable in my Per&s;on, from the Crown of my Head, to the Sole of my Foot: That for my Wit, (for every body, Madam, carries &s;omewhat about them which they call Wit) it is all Affectation: That I am an Ab|&s;tract of Vanity: That I am &s;o much in Love with my &s;elf, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to be &s;o with any body el&s;e. The&s;e things, Madam, that might have put &s;ome People into Anger, have put me into Love: For as tho&s;e who are naturally peevi&s;h, will be angry at People, let them endeavour ever &s;o much to plea&s;e them; &s;o we, who are naturally Amorous, cannot a|void being in Love with a Lady, let her take ever &s;o much Pains to anger us. And indeed, Madam, did People ground their Pa&s;&s;ion upon Rea&s;on, you have given me one of the mo&s;t rea&s;onable Cau&s;es to love you in the World: For as there is no Man of Wit but knows him|&s;elf to be a Fool, &s;o he ought to have an Opi|nion of their Judgments, who find it out as well as him&s;elf. It is reported as an In&s;tance of the Bravery of the <HI>Amazons,</HI> That they would never Marry a Man, till they had fought with him fir&s;t; and if he beat them ve|ry much, he might expect to be loved very much by them. Now I, Madam, who profe&s;s as great a Veneration for Wit, as the <HI>Amazons</HI> had for Courage, cannot have &s;o good a Rea|&s;on for Love, as your having exerci&s;ed your Wit upon me: Tho it is po&s;&s;ible you may attribute my Pa&s;&s;ion to another Cau&s;e, and as

you think, I love nothing be&s;ides my &s;elf, may have &s;ome kindne&s;s for you, becau&s;e you are never like to be my Rival: However, a&s;&s;ure your &s;elf, Madam, it is no &s;uch thing, but knowing the wor&s;t you can &s;ay of me to be true, and having a natural Affection for Truth, Wit, and Women, (you will think a Man a very general Lover, that can love Truth, Wit, and Women, at the &s;ame time) I mu&s;t needs be infinitely in Love with you, in whom I find them all together. Be not however deluded into a better Opinion of me, by what any Body can &s;ay; for as it is only your Hating me that makes me Love you, as &s;oon as that cea&s;es, I am afraid my Love will do &s;o too.

<P>FOR Friend I can hardly call you, &s;ince under that Di&s;gui&s;e you have done me one of the greate&s;t Injuries in the World; and it is vain for me to guard my Territories again&s;t the malicious De&s;igns of Enemies and Rivals; when you, whom I never took for either, have more prejudiced me in an Amour, than they could with all their Forces together. But that I may not condemn you without a Cau&s;e, nor conclude you guilty till I hear what you can &s;ay in your own Ju&s;tification, I will give you a plain Account of the Bu&s;ine&s;s. Meeting one of the Ladies la&s;t Night, with whom I am in Love, &s;he began a Di&s;cour&s;e of Lovers, where|in &s;he &s;hewed the many Inconveniencies that attend the having a Man of Wit in that Ca|pacity.

<PB N="16" REF="293">
&s;he had talked of <HI>Jews</HI> or <HI>Mahometans</HI>) agreed with her in all &s;he &s;aid; when &s;he turned brisk|ly upon me, and told me, For that Rea&s;on a Woman mu&s;t have a care of having any thing to do with me. I told her that was act|ing after the manner of &s;ome late Judges; <HI>Call a thing Trea&s;on without Law, and then Hang a Man for it without Proof.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This ju&s;t Remark alludes to the Severities u&s;ed in <HI>onmouth</HI>'s Rebellion.</NOTE> That I ap|pealed to all the World for my Innocence in the Matter, and defied my greate&s;t Enemies to bring any Evidence of my Guilt. She told me &s;he had it from <HI>&s;uch a one,</HI> who had it from <HI>another;</HI> and that, in fine, the original Author of this Calumny was <HI>your &s;elf.</HI> Now tho I grant you that &s;ome People might have &s;aid &s;uch a thing as this, out of Inadvertency; yet I can hardly believe a Man of your Pru|dence to have done it upon that Account. You, who very well know, That to commend a Man for a Wit to the Women, is like com|mending him for a good Prote&s;tant to the Fa|thers of the Inqui&s;ition; and he that reported me an Eunuch among them, could not do it upon a more malicious Account. They love a tame, ea&s;y, governable Fool, and fancy all Wits ill-natur'd and proud: Have not you of|ten told me &s;o? And after that to put me upon them for one! Well, Sir, I am a Gentleman, nor &s;hall I pa&s;s by &s;uch a thing as this, with|out Satisfaction. I expect therefore you &s;hould either give it under your Hand, That you ne|ver &s;aid any &s;uch thing of me; or if you really

It is true, Madam, I took the Boldne&s;s to ad|vi&s;e them not to be over-ha&s;ty in the Affair, &s;ince they might do it afterwards at their own Convenience; and Experiments of this Nature were difficult enough to correct, when they were once ill done.

<P>THO to tell a Man that you will di&s;po&s;e of his Heart to one who &s;hall u&s;e it ill, is but a very &s;mall Encouragement for him to part with it; yet &s;ince you &s;ay you have a particular Fancy for mine, I cannot refu&s;e you &s;uch a Trifle as that, upon whatever Terms you demand it. I have inclo&s;ed it therefore in this Letter, and tru&s;ted it to the Penny-Po&s;t, le&s;t your Genero&s;ity &s;hould have made you give a Me&s;&s;enger more for the bringing it, than the thing it &s;elf is really worth. I wi&s;h, Madam, it were better for your &s;ake; and can
<PB N="20" REF="297">
a&s;&s;ure you, That were it the mo&s;t modi&s;h one in the World, it &s;hould be at your Service. As it is, Madam, I am afraid you will think it very old-fa&s;hion'd, and too much given to tho&s;e antiquated Qualities, Con&s;tancy and Fi|delity. It is probable the Lady for whom you intend it, may de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e Things, and think a Heart of that &s;ort as ridiculous as a Lover in a &s;hort Cloak, &s;la&s;h Sleeves, pinck'd Dou|blet, and trunk Ho&s;e. But let her not be pre|judic'd again&s;t things for their fir&s;t Appear|ances; I have &s;een a very awkard Beginner, come to dance very well at la&s;t; and it is not impo&s;&s;ible but by good Management the Heart may be brought quite off tho&s;e di&s;agreeable Qualities. You may plea&s;e to tell her, That it having been bred up very tenderly till now, it would be convenient to treat it a little kind|lier than ordinary at fir&s;t, le&s;t it &s;hould be apt to run away: She &s;hould encourage his Sighs now and then with a kind of Whi&s;per; and when &s;he &s;ees the Fire grow a little faint, let her give but one or two kind Looks, and it will blaze out afre&s;h. Having been troubled with an extraordinary Fever, &s;ince it was in the Pre&s;ence of a certain Lady, it ought not to be expos'd to the open Air, for fear of catching Cold; &s;he may conveniently enough confine it to her Bed-Chamber, where it may be of great U&s;e rightly manag'd, and wake her in a Morning with half a Dozen deep|fetch'd Sighs, better than any Larum-Clock. You &s;ee, Madam, what Confidence I have in your Conduct, &s;ince I tru&s;t you to di&s;po&s;e of a
<PB N="21" REF="298">
Heart for me, that I have never been able to di&s;po&s;e of my &s;elf. You will think, perhaps, it is but making a Virtue of Nece&s;&s;ity, and &s;urrendering up a Fort which I am not able to hold out again&s;t You. However, Madam, the fierce&s;t Conquerors are kind to Garri&s;ons that yield upon the fir&s;t Summons; and as I know your Power to be greater than any of theirs; &s;o I doubt not but your Virtues are an|&s;werable to them. All the Favour I &s;hall beg for my Heart, is, That it may be treated as a Pri&s;oner of War, and that I may have the Li|berty of keeping a Corre&s;pondence with it, during its Confinement. To &s;how you I intend nothing but what is fair, I am &s;atisfied you &s;hould read all the Letters I write; and that none &s;hould come to me, but by your Ap|probation. And indeed you need not fear this making any E&s;cape; for if I can gue&s;s at all at his Humour, he will prefer &s;uch a Captivity to all the Liberty in the World; and will not be &s;o proud of the Titles of Prince, or Con|queror, as that of your Pri&s;oner and Slave.</P>

<P>I Have been the&s;e &s;ix Hours in debate, Whe|ther I &s;hould &s;tab my &s;elf, or write to you fir&s;t: At la&s;t, Madam, I have determined on the latter: For I con&s;ider, that if you &s;hould hear a Fellow mounted upon a Cricket, &s;ing|ing &s;ome doleful Ballad of my Death, you would be at a lo&s;s to know the Cau&s;e of &s;o &s;ad an Accident; and, in an Age &s;o inqui&s;itive as ours, would take it much better to have a Relation of the thing from the fir&s;t Hand, than to be put to the Trouble of &s;topping to enquire of it in the Street, or tru&s;ting it to the Fidelity of a <HI>Grub-&s;treet</HI> Hi&s;torian.

Now, Madam, I am really &s;o &s;en&s;ible of my Guilt of di&s;appointing you in this Manner, that after having arraigned, judged, and condemned my &s;elf for it, I am ju&s;t now upon the point of Execution; I mu&s;t confe&s;s, &s;ome People have advi&s;ed me to the

For though it was urged in my Defence, that I had &s;ome great Bu&s;ine&s;s which called me out; and that I had little hopes you &s;hould have granted me the Honour of meeting you &s;o &s;oon; yet this Excu&s;e does not &s;atisfie me in the lea&s;t: For why a Devil &s;hould a Man pre|tend to make Love, when he has great Bu&s;ine&s;s, and little Hope?

<P>IT is &s;o long &s;ince I wrote to you, that I am almo&s;t a&s;hamed of doing it now: But, to &s;ay the Truth, I have too ju&s;t an Excu&s;e for my Neglect, being relap&s;ed into a former Ma|lady, and notwith&s;tanding all the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Philo&s;ophy, fallen in Love ten times more

I am a&s;hamed to tell you how long I have been &s;o; but I am ten times more a|&s;hamed to tell you, I do not yet find the lea&s;t decay in my Pa&s;&s;ion, tho I have rea&s;on enough to believe the Lady did not care if &s;he &s;aw me hanging up at her Gate. Well; we may put as good a Face upon the Matter as we will; but fir&s;t or la&s;t I &s;ee Con&s;tancy comes up|on us all. In the Humour I am at pre&s;ent, I had a good Mind to for&s;wear ever being in Love again. And yet upon better Thoughts, I think I had as good try it once more: For of Three Amours I have had in my Life-time, (as for Amourettes, tho&s;e are not worth men|tioning) I valued the One Mi&s;tre&s;s after I left loving her; I loved Another, after I left valu|ing her; I love and value the Third, after hav|ing lo&s;t all Hopes of her: So that, methinks, according to the Cour&s;e of my Pa&s;&s;ions, I ought to love and value the next, after having obtained her. However, from this time for|ward, upon what Follies &s;oever you fall, be plea&s;ed for my &s;ake to &s;pare tho&s;e of Love; being very well &s;atisfied, there is not one Fol|ly of that kind (except Marriage) which I have not already committed. I have been, without Raillery, in Love with the Beauty of a Woman whom I have never &s;een; with the Wit of one whom I have never heard &s;peak, nor &s;een any thing that &s;he has written; and with the He|roic-Virtues of a Woman, without knowing any one Action of her Life, that could make me think &s;he had any. Con&s;idering how very
<PB N="32" REF="309">
common the&s;e Qualities are, I &s;uppo&s;e you will not ask me if I have ever been mi&s;taken. I know not what you think in the Country; but, for my Part, I am of Opinion a Man mu&s;t re&s;olve to abandon Women or Philo&s;o|phy entirely, for they will never agree well together. After an Ab&s;ence of five or &s;ix Months from Town, I find the Ladies &s;till the &s;ame; that is to &s;ay, &s;till various. Tho&s;e who were in Love when I went from Hence, are in Love &s;till; but they are in Love with other Men. They are con&s;tant to Love, but incon&s;tant to the Lovers: And in this Point, to &s;peak the Truth among Friends, I think Here is no great Difference between the two Sexes. The Men complain of the Women's Incon&s;tancy, and the Women of the Men's; for my Part, being unwilling to di&s;oblige ei|ther, I am very apt to agree with Both. But <HI>Cupid</HI> will have it &s;o; and what can weak Mortals do again&s;t &s;o potent a God? Adieu; live plea&s;antly, that is, philo&s;ophically; and guard your Heart from the Pains of Love.</P>

<L>Lament with me! with me your Sorrows join!</L>
<L>And mingle your united Tears with mine!</L>

<L>Begin, my Mu&s;e! begin your mournful Strains!</L>
<L>Tell the &s;ad Tale through all the Hills and Plains!</L>
<L>Tell it through ev'ry Lawn and ev'ry Grove!</L>
<L>Where Flocks can wander, or where Shepherds rove!</L>
<L>Bid neighb'ring Rivers tell the di&s;tant Sea,</L>

<L>'Tis done, and All obey the mournful Mu&s;e!</L>
<L>See, Hills, and Plains, and Winds have heard the News!</L>
<L>The foaming Sea o'erwhelms the frighten'd Shoar,</L>
<L>The Vallies tremble and the Mountains roar.</L>
<L>See lofty Oaks from firm Foundations torn,</L>
<L>And &s;tately Tow'rs in Heaps of Ruin mourn!</L>
<L>The gentle <HI>Thames,</HI> that rarely Pa&s;&s;ion knows,</L>
<L>Swells with this Sorrow, and her Banks o'erflows:</L>
<L>What Shrieks are heard? what Groans? what dying Cries?</L>

<L>O! why did I &s;urvive the fatal Day,</L>

<L>Why was not I beneath &s;ome Ruin lo&s;t?</L>
<L>Sunk in the Seas, or Shipwreck'd on the Coa&s;t?</L>
<L>Why did the Fates &s;pare this devoted Head?</L>
<L>Why did I live to hear that Thou wert dead?</L>
<L>By Thee my Griefs were calm'd, my Torments eas'd;</L>
<L>Nor knew I Plea&s;ure but as Thou wert pleas'd.</L>
<L>Where &s;hall I wander now, di&s;tre&s;s'd, alone?</L>
<L>What U&s;e have I of Life, now Thou art gone?</L>
<L><HI>I have no U&s;e, alas! but to deplore</HI></L>
