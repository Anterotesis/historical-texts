<P>The Origin of every Nation is nece&s;&s;arily ob&s;cure, and always lo&s;t in a pretended Antiquity.

That Britain

however was peopled from Gaul 1000 years before Chri&s;t, appears very probable,&mdash;the arguments in favour of this opinion are de|duced from the State of Popula|tion on the Continent, and from the Progre&s;s of it in the I&s;land it|&s;elf. It has been well ob&s;erved <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By Whitaker.</NOTE> that Names de&s;criptive of na|tional Manners cannot be the original Appellations of any peo|ple, they re&s;ult from the inter|cour&s;e
<PB N="94" REF="101">
and experience of the States around them, on who&s;e territories they have dared to en|croach; the Appellation of Bri|gantes, according to Strabo, came to &s;ignify a turbulent and plun|dering race, and the Denomina|tions of Celtae and Gael came to import, even among&s;t them&s;elves, the Ferocious and the Stranger.</P>
<P>The Name of Cymri appears to have been the great hereditary Di&s;tinction of the Gauls upon the Continent, and to have been car|ried
<PB N="95" REF="102">
with them into all their Con|que&s;ts; it was not retained in our I&s;land merely by the Natives of Wales, but was equally the Appellation of a Nation in the South-We&s;t of Somer&s;et&s;hire and the North-Ea&s;t of Cornwall.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Denomination of our I&s;land was certainly Albion, a name given before the Country was inhabited; it was the Celtic Term for Heights or Eminences; the Alps &s;ome ages before the Days of Strabo were called Al|bia,
<PB N="96" REF="103">
and in his time there remain|ed two tribes on the Mountains that bore the Names of Albioeci, and Albien&s;es.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Denomination was that of Britain, derived from a Celtic Word likewi&s;e &s;ignifying <HI>Divided,</HI> not <HI>Painted</HI>; this Etymo|logy has lately been proved not to have been applied to the Re|gion, but be&s;towed on the Inhabi|ters; not previou&s;ly borne on the Continent by the original Settlers of the Country, but a&s;&s;umed o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

<P>The Title of Wel&s;h &s;eems to ari&s;e from the Word Wall or Gall, an appellation which the Britons frequently gave each other; nor will this Derivation appear forced if we add, that the Channel be|twixt France and England was denominated Sinus Vallicus, or the Gallick Strait, &s;o late as the eighth Century, and that the Dutch and Germans call the

<P>The general Denomination of Wales was not impo&s;ed on the Country by the Saxons, but was the acknowledged Appellation of the Region as early as the &s;ixth Century, if we may believe a Quotation from Talie&s;&s;in, as cited by Dr. Davies.</P>
