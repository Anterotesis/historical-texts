<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE former Part of this Trea|ti&s;e
has been cen&s;ur'd for two
Faults; fir&s;t for being ob&s;cure;
&s;econdly, for not being &s;o practi|cal
as it ought to be: As to the
Fir&s;t, I an&s;wer, That <HI>Ob&s;curity</HI> may be
taken in two Sen&s;es, as Real, or as Relative
to the Under&s;tanding of the Reader; if
Ob&s;curity is taken in the fir&s;t Sen&s;e, I will
venture to affirm, That it is unju&s;tly blam'd
upon that Account: Perhaps it may not be
all true, but I am &s;ure it is intelligible. If
Ob&s;curity is taken in the &s;econd Sen&s;e, <HI>Eu|clid</HI>'s
Elements may be &s;aid to be ob&s;cure:
I freely own that I had made too partial a
Judgment of the Capacity of &s;everal of my
Readers; and yet it is true, That many, not
bred up in the Profe&s;&s;ion of Phy&s;ick, under|&s;tood
the Whole; many, a great Part of it;
<PB REF="4">
and it was not po&s;&s;ible to write it down to the
Capacity of every Body.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Fault, of its not being &s;uffi|ciently
practical, I have endeavour'd to re|pair,
by the Addition of this Second Part,
which I was oblig'd to write in ha&s;te, when
the Di&s;tre&s;s both of my Mind and Body, be|&s;ides
Bu&s;ine&s;s, render'd me very unfit for
&s;uch an Undertaking: All I can &s;ay for it
is, That tho' it be le&s;s accurate, it may per|haps
be more u&s;eful than the fir&s;t, it being
much &s;uch a Work as an Almanack, of pub|lick
Benefit, but from which no body I be|lieve
ever propos'd any Reputation. It is a
Collection of the &s;cattered Precepts of the
Fir&s;t Part, and other new Rules, extended
to the mo&s;t common Di&s;ea&s;es as well as Con|&s;titutions
of Human Bodies. I have &s;till
follow'd the Method of the learned and in|du&s;trious
<HI>Boerhaave,</HI> who has certainly &s;tu|died
and taught this Part of the Profe&s;&s;ion
more than any that ever were before him.</P>
<P>I cannot think it trifling nor unnece&s;&s;ary
to treat this Dietetick Part of Medicine
by it &s;elf with &s;ome Accuracy, for the fol|lowing
Rea&s;ons: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Becau&s;e the Parts
of any Art or Science are often be&s;t under|&s;tood
when they are treated &s;eparately: <HI>Se|condly,</HI>
Becau&s;e the Practitioners in Phy|&s;ick
and Chirurgery are often fru&s;trated in
their Intentions by Errors in Diet com|mitted
<PB REF="5">
by their Patients, a Misfortune that
I my &s;elf have felt &s;everal times, and, as I
&s;uppo&s;e, in common with others of the Pro|fe&s;&s;ion.
<HI>Thirdly,</HI> Becau&s;e &s;ome practical
Rules of this &s;ort may be u&s;eful to &s;uch as
are remote from good Advice; and likewi&s;e
to &s;ome coar&s;e Practitioners which they are
obliged to make u&s;e of: By the Methods
pre&s;crib'd in this &s;hort Treati&s;e, which are
almo&s;t within the Reach of every Body, more
Good and le&s;s Mi&s;chief will be done in acute
Di&s;tempers, than by Medicines improperly and
un&s;ea&s;onably admini&s;tred; and great Cures
may be effected in Chronical Di&s;tempers, by
a proper Regimen of the Diet. I hope I
have done with this Subject. I was drawn
in to write the Fir&s;t Part by Accident, and
to write the Second by &s;ome Defects in the
Fir&s;t; the&s;e are the cumber&s;ome Perqui&s;ites
of Authors.</P>

as contain an acid e&s;&s;ential

<P><PB N="244" REF="10">
Several &s;orts of <HI>Plumbs,</HI> and &s;ome
&s;orts of <HI>Pears,</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hable by their
rough &s;typtick Ta&s;te.</P>
<P><HI>Quinces,</HI> which by their Quality are
often u&s;eful to weak Stomachs, and
in &s;topping of Fluxes of Blood.</P>
<P><HI>Pomegranates,</HI> which contain a Juice
&s;typtick, and extremely cooling.</P>
<P><HI>Barberries, Medlars, Cornelian Cher|ries,</HI>
all beneficial in Bloody-Fluxes.</P>
<P><HI>Sorrel,</HI> u&s;eful in Spitting of Blood,

<P><HI>Pur&s;lain,</HI> &s;ucculent, &s;ubacid, with

<P><HI>Burnet,</HI> a&s;tringent, with a gentle

<P><HI>Tamarinds,</HI> cooling, a&s;tringent, yet
laxative to the lower Belly.</P>
<P><HI>Capers,</HI> a&s;tringent and diuretick.</P>
<P>All <HI>Pickles,</HI> e&s;pecially <HI>Samphire,</HI>
which is &s;timulating. Such &s;ort of
Sub&s;tances by their Acidity and a|&s;tringent
Quality offend &s;ome Sto|machs.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="11">
There are <HI>Wines</HI> of the &s;ame Qua|lity,
known by their rough au&s;tere
Ta&s;te; as likewi&s;e all acidulated and
chalybeat <HI>Waters.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Strong Waters</HI> or <HI>&s;pirituous Liquors</HI>
contract and harden the &s;olid Parts
mo&s;t of all.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>2. Alimentary Sub&s;tances &s;oftening and
relaxing.</HEAD>
<P>The Juices of mo&s;t &s;orts of ripe
Garden Fruits, as <HI>Cherries,</HI> are cool|ing,
and laxative to the Bowels; their
Kernels are good for the Gravel in the
Kidneys.</P>
<P><HI>Strawberries,</HI> which by their fra|grant
Smell &s;eem likewi&s;e to be cor|dial.
The Seeds, which are obtain'd
by &s;haking the ripe Fruit in Water,
are an excellent Remedy again&s;t the
Stone: The Juice of Strawberries
and Limons in Spring-Water is an
excellent Drink in bilious Fevers.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="12">
<HI>Oranges,</HI> tho&s;e that are &s;weet are
more relaxing than the bitter or <HI>Se|ville</HI>
Oranges, which neverthele&s;s are
not heating; the&s;e are an excellent
Remedy again&s;t the hot Scurvy.</P>
<P><HI>Citrons</HI> and <HI>Limons,</HI> their Juices
more cooling than that of Oranges.
Sour Limons do not po&s;&s;e&s;s this re|laxing
Quality very much, they be|ing
&s;omewhat &s;typtick.</P>
<P><HI>Apples,</HI> which are likewi&s;e pecto|ral,
cooling, and lenitive; they dif|fer
con&s;iderably as to the Kinds of
them, and their Qualities may be
ea&s;ily known by their Ta&s;te.</P>
<P><HI>Pears</HI> have mo&s;t of the &s;ame Qua|lities;
&s;ome Kinds by their high Fla|vour
&s;eem to be more cordial than
Apples.</P>
<P><HI>Peaches,</HI> which are likewi&s;e cordial
and pectoral.</P>
<P>Sweet <HI>Plumbs,</HI> tho&s;e of the au&s;tere
Kind are a&s;tringent.</P>
<P><HI>Mulberries,</HI> pectoral, corrective of
the bilious Alkali.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="13">
<HI>Apricocks,</HI> unle&s;s mellow, are ra|ther
&s;omewhat &s;typtick.</P>
<P><HI>Goo&s;eberries,</HI> extremely ripe, are le|nient;
unripe, they are &s;our, and ra|ther
a&s;tringent.</P>
<P><HI>Currants</HI> are good in Spitting of
Blood, extremely cooling, and &s;ome|what
a&s;tringent. The Jelly or Rob
of Currants, mix'd with Water, is a
mo&s;t excellent Drink in bilious Fe|vers.</P>
<P><HI>Grapes</HI> taken in moderate Quanti|ties
help the Appetite and Dige&s;tion;
in great Quantities, they re&s;olve the
Bile too much, and produce Fluxes;
dry'd, they are pectoral.</P>
<P><HI>Figs</HI> are great Subduers of Acri|mony,
u&s;eful in Hoar&s;ene&s;s and
Coughs, extremely emollient, and by
relaxing the Urinary Pa&s;&s;ages, diu|retick,
u&s;eful in bloody Urine; it
has been always believed that the
immoderate u&s;e of them generates
Lice.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="14">
Plants of the low pomiferous Kind,
as <HI>Melons, Pompions, Gourds, Cucum|bers,</HI>
contain a cooling Juice, with a
nitrous Salt; that of Melons and
the <HI>Ananas</HI> is rich and cordial; they
are diuretick; and there are In&s;tances,
when eaten in great Quantities, they
have produced bloody Urine; they
ought to be taken fa&s;ting. The
Juice of Cucumbers is too cold for
&s;ome Stomachs, and ought not to
be taken by &s;uch as have thin and
poor Blood; if the Stem upon which
they grow be brui&s;ed, the Pulp of
the Fruit grows bitter, and has the
Effect of Coloquintids. The Juice
of an unripe Cucumber is purga|tive.
Cucumbers are u&s;eful in bloody
Urine.</P>
<P>All Fruits which contain a &s;ub|acid
e&s;&s;ential Salt, much Phlegm, and
a &s;mall Quantity of Oil, have this
lenient Quality; as likewi&s;e the emol|lient
Pot-Herbs; as,</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="15">
<HI>Cole, Cabbage, Coleworts,</HI> which
are &s;oft and demulcent, without any
Acidity. The Jelly or Juice of red
Cabbage, bak'd in an Oven, and
mix'd with Honey, is an excellent
Pectoral.</P>
<P><HI>Lettuce,</HI> which has a milky Juice,
with an anodyne or opiate Quality,
re&s;olvent of the Bile, proper for me|lancholy
People, diuretick, and good
in Stranguries, e&s;pecially when eat
raw; it is reckoned to increa&s;e Milk.</P>
<P><HI>Cichory</HI> and <HI>Dandelion</HI> have &s;ome
of the &s;ame Qualities, with a &s;mall
degree of Bitterne&s;s extremely agree|able
to the Stomach, and not heat|ing.
The Juice of the Dandelion is
a Remedy in intermitting Fevers.</P>
<P><HI>Spinage,</HI> emollient, but not very
nouri&s;hing; it is reckoned good in
Inflammations of the Bowels.</P>
<P><HI>Beets,</HI> emollient, nutritive, and
relaxing.</P>
<P><HI>Carrots,</HI> good in nephritical Ca&s;es,
antiacid, and fattening.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="16">
<HI>Par&s;nips,</HI> u&s;eful in phlegmatick Co|licks;
the Plant from which Apopo|nox
is taken, is a &s;ort of Par&s;nip.</P>
<P><HI>Skirrets,</HI> u&s;eful in bloody Urine,
and Spitting of Blood.</P>
<P><HI>Scorzonera,</HI> demulcent in the Small|Pox,
Meazles, and pe&s;tilential Fevers,
and for Gouty People; the expre&s;s'd
Juice better than the Decoction.</P>
<P><HI>Goats-beard,</HI> an alimentary Root,
has mo&s;t of the Qualities of Scorzo|nera.</P>
<P>Emollient likewi&s;e are all farinace|ous
or mealy Sub&s;tances.</P>
<P><HI>Barley,</HI> which is deterging, tho 
vi&s;cous in a &s;mall degree; the De|coction
and Cream of Barley are
proper in inflammatory Di&s;tem|pers.</P>
<P><HI>Rice,</HI> nouri&s;hing, good in Hae|morrages,
or Fluxes of Blood.</P>
<P><HI>Mays</HI> is not &s;o ea&s;ily brought to
Fermentation as other Grains, there|fore
more vi&s;cous.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="17">
<HI>Wheat,</HI> the propere&s;t of any Grain
for Bread, which, when not entirely
purged from the Bran, is laxative,
and &s;timulating to the Bowels.</P>
<P><HI>Rice,</HI> the Bread, more ace&s;cent
and le&s;s nouri&s;hing than that of
Wheat.</P>
<P><HI>Oats,</HI> clean&s;ing, re&s;olving, and
pectoral; Oatmeal and Butter out|wardly
apply'd dry the Scab on the
Head.</P>
<P><HI>Millet,</HI> diuretick, clean&s;ing, and
good in Di&s;ea&s;es of the Kidneys.</P>
<P><HI>Panick,</HI> aperient, boil'd with Milk,
demulcent, temperating Acrimony.</P>
<P><HI>Pea&s;e</HI> contain a &s;oft Oil, without
any &s;picy Quality; therefore are ex|tremely
demulcent, and temper Acri|mony.</P>
<P><HI>Beans</HI> and <HI>Kidney-Beans</HI> have the
&s;ame Qualities; they are reckoned
diuretick, and good for the Stone.</P>
<P>It has been commonly reckoned,
becau&s;e of the Vi&s;co&s;ity of Pea&s;e and
Beans, that People who live a &s;e|dentary
<PB N="252" REF="18">
Life &s;hould not feed much
upon them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Animal Oils; Cream, Butter,</HI>
and <HI>Marrow,</HI> are all lenient and nou|ri&s;hing:
Marrow is excellent in the
dry Scurvy with crackling of the
Bones, where it performs its natural
Office.</P>
<P>Of all Drinks, <HI>Whey</HI> is the mo&s;t
relaxing, &s;o are warm Water and De|coctions
of mealy Sub&s;tances, and
<HI>Panadas,</HI> or Bread boil'd in Water.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>3. Diluting Sub&s;tances.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Water</HI> and <HI>watery Liquors,</HI> without
any &s;aline Sub&s;tance; Decoctions of
<HI>mealy Sub&s;tances; Robs</HI> and <HI>Gellies</HI> of
Garden Fruits in Water.</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olving</HI> is bringing a Fluid which
is new concreted into the State of
Fluidity again. Such are</P>
<P>All Sub&s;tances which are &s;apona|ceous,
or contain Salt and Oil;
therefore mo&s;t ripe <HI>Garden Fruits</HI>
<PB N="253" REF="19">
have this Quality, and <HI>Honey</HI> mo&s;t of
all vegetable Sub&s;tances. Mere dilu|ting
di&s;&s;olves and carries off Salts.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>4. Anti-acid, or contrary to Acidity
or Sourne&s;s, are,</HEAD>
<P>All <HI>Animal Diet</HI> in general, be|cau&s;e
no Animal has any acid Salt
in it, e&s;pecially Fle&s;h roa&s;ted; tho'
not &s;o ea&s;y of Dige&s;tion as boil'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Animals</HI> which feed on other
Animals mu&s;t have this Quality
&s;tronger than tho&s;e who feed on acid
Vegetables; &s;uch are mo&s;t Fi&s;hes, all
Birds which feed upon Worms and
In&s;ects, &s;everal Kinds of Water-Fowl,
Woodcocks, Snipes, and &s;everal
Kinds of &s;mall Birds, which for that
Rea&s;on afford a higher Aliment than
tho&s;e that feed upon Grains or other
Vegetables.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fle&s;h</HI> of <HI>Animals</HI> differs accord|ing
as they are terre&s;trial, aquatick,
or amphibious. Fi&s;hes contain much
<PB N="254" REF="20">
Oil, and amphibious Animals par|ticipate
&s;omewhat of the Nature of
Fi&s;hes, and are oily; and the &s;ame
Species of Animals differs according
to the Soil and Air it lives in, and
the Nouri&s;hment which it takes, as
tho&s;e in Mar&s;hes and Mountains; the
Fle&s;h of Oxen, Sheep, Deer, in
different Pa&s;turage; and this is in
none more &s;en&s;ible than in Hogs
Fle&s;h.</P>
<P><HI>Young Animals</HI> from their Age and
the Nature of their Aliment have more
tender Fibres, and more &s;uperfluous
Humidity than old Animals, which
have their Fibres tougher, and the
Juices more exalted and reli&s;hing.</P>
<P><HI>Mutton</HI> by Experiment is the mo&s;t
per&s;pirable of all animal Food, and
Hogs Fle&s;h and Oy&s;ters the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fle&s;h</HI> of <HI>Animals</HI> which take
and dige&s;t a great Quantity of Food,
and con&s;equently u&s;e &s;trong Exerci&s;e,
mu&s;t be nouri&s;hing, becau&s;e they
have &s;trong Sanguification, &s;uch are
<PB N="255" REF="21">
Pigeons; and the &s;ame is true of
&s;ome Fi&s;hes.</P>
<P>The Nature of mo&s;t &s;ort of ani|mal
Diet may be di&s;covered by Ta&s;te
and other &s;en&s;ible Qualities, and &s;ome
of tho&s;e general Rules above-men|tion'd,
without particular Di&s;qui&s;i|tions
upon every Kind.</P>
<P><HI>Eggs</HI> are perhaps the highe&s;t, mo&s;t
nouri&s;hing and exalted of all animal
Food, and mo&s;t indige&s;tible, be|cau&s;e
no body can take and dige&s;t
the &s;ame Quantity of them as of
other Food.</P>
<P><HI>Shell-Fi&s;h</HI> are nouri&s;hing, and their
Oil is corrected by their Salts, which
make it pungent and &s;timulating.</P>

<P><HI>RIGOR, Coldne&s;s.</HI> A right Regi|men
during the Rigor or cold
Fit in the beginning of a Fever, is
of great Importance, and Mi&s;takes
of dangerous Con&s;equence: A long
continued Rigor is a Sign of a
&s;trong Di&s;ea&s;e, and is in it &s;elf an.
Approach towards Death; during
the Rigor, the Circulation is le&s;s
quick, and the Blood actually &s;tag|nates
in the Extremities, and pre&s;|&s;ing
upon the Heart creates great
Anxieties, and may produce Con|cretions
about the Heart, and in
other Parts of the Body; therefore a
Rigor increa&s;eth an Inflammation.
Tho&s;e who die of Quartan Fevers,
die in the cold Fit; and indeed there
<PB N="304" REF="70">
is no Mi&s;chief but what may pro|ceed
from a Rigor of long Dura|tion.</P>
<P>In &s;uch Rigors, all warm Cordials
and &s;timulating Sub&s;tances are im|proper,
for the fir&s;t acting with
force upon the right Ventricle of the
Heart, may drive the Blood with
too much Force through the Lungs;
and &s;timulating Sub&s;tances, by con|&s;tringing
the Ve&s;&s;els, often increa&s;e
the Symptom.</P>
<P>In &s;uch a Rigor, nothing is more
proper than Water, which dilutes and
relaxes at the &s;ame time, and will
&s;ooner terminate the cold Fit, and
throw the Patient into a Sweat, than
the warme&s;t Cordial; if a very &s;mall
Quantity of Rheni&s;h Wine be mix'd
with the Water, it will be &s;till more
effectual: In this Ca&s;e &s;trong Fric|tions
of the Extremities relieve.</P>
<P><HI>Anxieties.</HI> In Anxieties which at|tend
Fevers, when the cold Fit is
over, a warmer Regimen may be
<PB N="305" REF="71">
allow'd; and becau&s;e Anxieties often
happen by Spa&s;ms from Wind, Spices
are u&s;eful.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e Anxieties, Soapy Sub|&s;tances
which di&s;&s;olve the Blood, are
indicated; ripe Fruits; &s;ome of the
lacte&s;cent Plants, as Lettuce, Endive,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and e&s;pecially Honey, have this
Quality.</P>
<P><HI>Thir&s;t.</HI> In Thir&s;t attending Fevers,
Liquors &s;hould not be drank quite
cold; for cold Liquors, by con&s;tring|ing
the Glands of the Palate and
Throat, do not quench Thir&s;t &s;o
well as Liquors moderately warm:
In this Ca&s;e &s;ubacid Liquors &s;hould be
drank plentifully; all Salts increa&s;e
Thir&s;t, except Nitre, and dulcify'd Spi|rit
of Nitre mix'd with Water, is very
proper in this Ca&s;e; &s;o are Barley|Water
and Emul&s;ions, except in great
Weakne&s;s and Flatulencies of the Sto|mach,
in which Ca&s;e Water mix'd
with a &s;mall Quantity of Rheni&s;h
Wine, is be&s;t of all.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="72">
<HI>Sickne&s;s, Vomiting.</HI> This is one of
the mo&s;t trouble&s;ome Symptoms at|tending
a Fever, becau&s;e it renders
the Patient incapable of taking any
thing.</P>
<P>This Symptom is often prevented
by giving a Vomit; or cur'd by pro|moting
the Vomiting for a while by
tepid Water.</P>
<P>During the Symptom, acid Li|quors,
and ev'n &s;uch as are au&s;tere
and a&s;tringent, are indicated, becau&s;e
&s;uch &s;trengthen the Fibres of the
Stomach; and indeed Nature directs
Patients to &s;uch a Diet, for they co|vet
&s;ubacid Liquors, and abhor fat
and oily things.</P>
<P>Diluting, and &s;ometimes relaxing
the Belly, and carrying the bilious
Salts downwards, often cures this
Symptom.</P>
<P>Attention is to be given to the
Appetites of Patients, in this and
many other Ca&s;es, who have &s;ome|times
coveted odd things which
<PB N="307" REF="73">
have reliev'd them, as Salt, Vine|gar,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Vomiting, from a bilious Cau&s;e,
is cur'd by &s;ubacid Liquors; Vomit|ing,
from &s;ome putrid Cau&s;e, by
Salts of all Kinds; in &s;uch a Ca&s;e,
Water-Gruel with Cream of Tartar,
Rheni&s;h Wine and Water, Jelly of
Currants, Marmalade of Quinces,
Sorrel boil'd in Broths well skimm'd
from Fat, are beneficial.</P>
<P>If the Vomiting comes from a
phlegmatick Cau&s;e, Spices, and bit|ter
things will relieve. The Counter|poi&s;on
mu&s;t be adapted to the Cau&s;e;
for Example, in Poi&s;on from Subli|mated
Corro&s;ive, and Ar&s;enick.</P>
<P>In the Fir&s;t, alkaline Sub&s;tances;
in the Second, oily Sub&s;tances are
proper; in both, diluent.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to judge of the Cau&s;e by
the Sub&s;tances which the Patient
throws up.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="74">
Whether Vomit may be &s;afely
or properly given, mu&s;t be judg'd
by the Circum&s;tances; if there be
any Symptoms of an Inflammation
of the Stomach, a Vomit is ex|tremely
dangerous.</P>
<P><HI>Wind</HI> and <HI>Spa&s;ms</HI> are occa&s;ion'd by
the feveri&s;h Heat expanding the ae|rial
Particles in the Fluids.</P>
<P>Whatever is anodyne and quiets
Convul&s;ions, and what abates the
Heat, relieves this Symptom.</P>
<P><HI>Weakne&s;s,</HI> or the Impotence of ex|erci&s;ing
animal Motion which attends
Fevers, proceeds from too great Ful|ne&s;s
in the beginning, and too great
Inanition in the latter end of the
Di&s;ea&s;e; for whatever &s;tops or re|tards
the Circulation in the &s;malle&s;t
Ve&s;&s;els, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the Brain
(which either of the&s;e Cau&s;es will do)
produceth this Symptom. Tho&s;e
two Cau&s;es demand different Me|thods,
in the fir&s;t emptying and dilu|ting;
<PB N="309" REF="75">
in the latter, a more plentiful
Nouri&s;hment, the u&s;e of Wine dilu|ted
with Water, and Spices in &s;mall
Quantities, Jellies, Broths, the alka|le&s;cent
Quality of which may be cor|rected
with &s;ome acid, unle&s;s there
be Signs of Acidity, and in that Ca&s;e
the Diet ought to be contrary to the
Cau&s;e of the Symptom; Viper-Broth
is both anti-acid and nouri&s;hing.</P>
<P>In Debility, from great Lo&s;s of
Blood, Wine, and all Aliment that
is ea&s;ily a&s;&s;imulated, or turn'd into
Blood, is proper; Blood is required
to make Blood; a &s;mall Quantity of
Blood brings the Patient into danger
of a Drop&s;y.</P>
<P>Frictions of the extreme Parts re|lieve
Weakne&s;&s;es, as they promote
the Flux of the Juices and Spirits in
the Joints and Limbs.</P>
<P>Fat People are mo&s;t &s;ubject to this
Symptom of Weakne&s;s in Fevers,
becau&s;e the Fat, melted by the fever|i&s;h
Heat, ob&s;tructs the &s;mall Canals,
<PB N="310" REF="76">
and con&s;equently produceth this
Symptom. This is evident by the
great Lo&s;s of Fat &s;uch People &s;u&s;tain
in Fevers. In the latter end of Fe|vers,
&s;uch are weak by the Laxity of
the Fibres, and the Emptine&s;s of the
&s;maller Ve&s;&s;els; &s;uch therefore mu&s;t
be treated with particular Care, <HI>viz,</HI>
after due Evacuations, diluting
&s;trongly both by Drink and Cly&s;ters,
avoiding all things oily, and u&s;ing
Sugar, Honey, and ripe Fruits.</P>
<P>Cordials made of &s;pirituous Li|quors
are not the be&s;t Remedies for
this Debility, tho' they increa&s;e the
Force of the Heart, and are nece&s;&s;a|ry
&s;ometimes to keep up the vital
Functions, they rather coagulate the
Fluid; they add Strength to the Mill,
but congeal the Stream. Whatever
makes the Circulation more free
through the &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, is a Cor|dial.</P>
<P><HI>Heat;</HI> the Degree of which may
be known by the Thermo&s;cope, the
<PB N="311" REF="77">
Sen&s;ation of the Patient, the Inten&s;e|ne&s;s
of the red Colour of the Urine,
the Sizene&s;s of the Blood, the Di&s;&s;i|pation
of the fluid Parts, which
renders it thicker; the Hardne&s;s,
Strength, and Frequency of the
Pul&s;e, which makes the Friction the
&s;tronger, to which the Heat is pro|portional,
the bad Di&s;po&s;ition of the
Humour, and the dry Temperament
of the Body.</P>
<P>Feveri&s;h Heat is moderated by
Blood-letting, by mu&s;cular Re&s;t, by
moderate Ligatures which compre&s;s the
Veins only, and often removed from
Joint to Joint, by a mechanical Rea|&s;on,
retard the Circulation; of &s;uch
&s;ort is dry Cupping, bathing the
lower Parts, watery Liquors for Drink,
not cold, but tepid; &s;ubacid, as Jel|ly
of Currants di&s;&s;olved in tepid wa|tery
Liquors; Decoctions of mealy
Sub&s;tances acidulated, Sub&s;tances a|nodyne,
Sub&s;tances which di&s;&s;olve
Concretions, as Sugar, Honey, and
<PB N="312" REF="78">
the &s;imple Oxymel, often u&s;ed by
<HI>Hippocrates,</HI> plentiful diluting, and
re&s;toring as much Water to the Blood
as is di&s;&s;ipated by the Heat; all de|mulcent
and relaxing Sub&s;tances,
cooling the Air in the Room, open|ing
the Curtains, and removing too
thick Bed-clothes; all &s;timulating and
&s;lyptick Sub&s;tances to be avoided, be|cau&s;e

&s;olid Parts.</P>
<P><HI>Delirium.</HI> Too great Alacrity and
Promptne&s;s in An&s;wering, e&s;pecially
in Per&s;ons naturally of another Tem|per,
is a Sign of an approaching De|lirium:
In a feveri&s;h Delirium there
is a &s;mall Inflammation of the Brain;
therefore any thing which increa&s;eth
the Circulation in the lower Parts,
and dimini&s;heth the Pre&s;&s;ure on the
Brain, is beneficial, as immerging
the Feet in warm Water; nothing
relieves the Head more than the
Piles, therefore Suppo&s;itories of Ho|ney,
Aloes, and Rock-Salt, ought
<PB N="313" REF="79">
to be try'd, relaxing by emollient
and watery Sub&s;tances, both in
Drink and Cly&s;ters, e&s;pecially Bar|ley-Cream
and Barley-Gruel.</P>
<P><HI>Coma Sleepine&s;s.</HI> A Coma will
proceed either from a Pre&s;&s;ure upon
the Originals of the Nerves, by
too great Repletion; or from a
Penury of Spirits by too great Ina|nition.</P>
<P>Old Men are &s;ubject to Comas by
the Tenacity of the Fluids circula|ting
in the Brain, which being re|&s;olved
by the Fever, ob&s;truct the
&s;mall Canals of the Brain: In young
People it commonly proceeds from
Fulne&s;s, and is be&s;t cur'd by letting
Blood, and relaxing the Belly. The
Sign of &s;uch a Fulne&s;s is, a red
Countenance, and Eyes inflamed; if
it proceeds from a glutinous Oil, it
ought to be attempted to be re&s;olv'd
by Water, nitrous Salts, Soaps, and
&s;ubacid Liquors.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="80">
People recovering from Comas,
mu&s;t take at fir&s;t &s;oft Nouri&s;hment,

<P>In profu&s;e Sweats, Care at lea&s;t
&s;hould be taken, by diluting, to re|&s;tore

<P><HI>A Diarrhoea Loo&s;ene&s;s</HI> proves often a

<P>Attention is to be given to the
Cau&s;e of Acidity; it is to be cur'd
by Anti-acids; but, as in Fevers, the
Cau&s;e is more frequently alkaline and
bilious, Acid or four things re&s;olve,
and it happens that oily Sub&s;tances
by bla&s;ting the Acrimony will do
good in Diarrhoeas. Oily Sub&s;tances
of them&s;elves do not irritate or pro|voke
Diarrhoeas, they only lubricate
or make the Bowels &s;lippery. Diar|hoeas
ari&s;ing from Quantities of Fruit
are often cur'd by Emul&s;ions.</P>

warm during the Eruption; and that
then Diet be cool; for which Rea&s;on
the moderate U&s;e of Acids, as Juice

<P>A due Attention to the few Rules

Acrimony, and Ob&s;truction of the

<P>The Cau&s;es of &s;uch a Fever are
various; Errors in the Non-Naturals,
Air, Meat and Drink, Re&s;t and Mo|tion.
Such a Fever will be rais'd by
Vehement Exerci&s;e or Labour, Heat
of the Sun, by long Thir&s;t, by the
immoderate U&s;e of fermented and
&s;pirituous Liquors; and hot things,
as Spices; and by great La&s;&s;itude en|dured
any way, e&s;pecially in hot

the general Cau&s;es of Inflammations,

are a bad Conformation of the

impacted Matter. Relaxing Ali|ment,
of which Barley and all its
Preparations are the be&s;t.</P>
<P>In this State, Diureticks, which
have not much Acrimony in them,
are proper, for Fluxes of Urine re|lieve
the Lungs; for this Intention,
an Infu&s;ion of Fenel Roots in warm

and to re&s;olve and dige&s;t as much
of the feveri&s;h Matter as we can;
for the longer the Eruption is a com|ing,
and the &s;maller when it comes,
the Di&s;ea&s;e is le&s;s dangerous; there|fore
all the Methods prractis'd in
the beginning of inflammatory Di&s;|ea&s;es
are here nece&s;&s;ery, with a par|ticular
Care of clean&s;ing the ali|mentary
Duct by Vomiting and
Cly&s;ters, the Impurities of which
will be carried into the Blood.</P>
<P>There is not yet found any par|ticular
Antidote to the poi&s;onous
Stimulus of this Di&s;temper; the
learned <HI>Boerhaave</HI> is of opinion,
<PB N="416" REF="182">
that if any &s;uch could be found, it
mu&s;t be in Antimony, or Mercury
intirely de&s;titute of all Acrimony:
The Effects of Mercury on all Ul|cerations
are very manife&s;t.</P>
<P>Bleeding, which is extremely u&s;e|ful
in the beginning of the Di&s;ea&s;e,
is not &s;o proper and u&s;eful when it
is advanc'd.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Stage the whole Ha|bit
of the Body ought to be re|lax'd,
a free Per&s;piration thro' the
Skin, without violent Sweating, pro|moted;
the Vi&s;co&s;ity or Toughne&s;s
of the Fluids taken off by diluents;
the alkale&s;cent State of the Salts cor|rected;
all the&s;e things are effected
by emollient Fomentations apply'd
inwardly in Cly&s;ters, and why not
outwardly to the Skin? Such are
us'd &s;ucce&s;sfully in other Eruptions,
as Ery&s;ipelas, Shingles, by a &s;lender
Diet of Decoctions of farinaceous
Vegetables, and copious drinking
<PB N="417" REF="183">
of cooling Liquors, with nitrous
and acid Salts, and other acid Sub|&s;tances,
mix'd with them; no Fle&s;h,
unle&s;s it be &s;mall Chicken-Broth;
no Spice; the Air ought not to
be &s;poil'd by Heat, nor the Cover|ings
of the Bed &s;o thick as to pro|mote
Sweat.</P>
<P>The Greatne&s;s and Danger of
this Di&s;ea&s;e is e&s;timated by the Quan|tity
of Eruptions on the Face and
other Parts of the Head; therefore
the Matter ought to be &s;olicited by
all po&s;&s;ible Methods to the lower
Parts, e&s;pecially the Legs, by Fo|mentations,
Bathing, Epi&s;pa&s;ticks,
Bli&s;tering, and through the whole
Di&s;ea&s;e keeping the Feet and Legs
warm; the Brea&s;t and Head not
any more cover'd than to keep them
from the Impre&s;&s;ion of cold Air.</P>
<P>During the Filling and Ripening
of the Pu&s;tles, the Diet may be
more plentiful, but &s;till not hot or
<PB N="418" REF="184">
inflammatory, with the due U&s;e of
anodyne Sub&s;tances: In this State
Demulcents, or what abates Acri|mony;
and where the Circum&s;tances
of the Patient require it, a Spoon|ful
or two of Canary Wine, twice
or thrice a Day, are proper: The
Diet in this State ought likewi&s;e to
be adapted to the particular Symp|toms
of the Di&s;ea&s;e, as clean&s;ing,
attenuating, expectorating; to pro|mote
the Spitting, diuretick; when
that is &s;uppre&s;s'd, and Cly&s;ters dilu|ent,
without any Stimulus, frequent|ly
injected, are beneficial in every
Stage of the Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>When the Age, Temperament,
high Pul&s;e, and e&s;pecially a Watch|fulne&s;s
and Delirium, all would &s;eem
to demand it in any other Ca&s;e,
why not Bleeding in this State?
which I know to have been us'd
with great Succe&s;s; a great many
Ve&s;&s;els are in this State almo&s;t im|pervious
<PB N="419" REF="185">
by the Fluids; tho&s;e who
die of this Di&s;ea&s;e have inward In|flammations,
e&s;pecially in the Lungs;
tho&s;e Rea&s;ons &s;eem to ju&s;tify Bleed|ing.</P>
<P>Indeed the gangrenous Di&s;po&s;i|tion
which appears in the malig|nant
Kind, is a Rea&s;on again&s;t it,
but hardly any thing will do good
in the&s;e extremely malignant Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>In &s;uch malignant Kinds, all that
is left is at la&s;t to try evacuating
the morbifick Matter by other ways,
as Epi&s;pa&s;ticks and Stools procur'd
by lenitive Sub&s;tances, not irritating,
which would only agitate the Hu|mours
and increa&s;e the Fever.</P>

<HEAD>Gravel, Stone.</HEAD>
<P>A Stone or &s;tony Matter may
grow in any Part of a Human Bo|dy;
for when any thing in&s;oluble
&s;ticks in any Part of the Body, it
<PB N="420" REF="186">
gathers a Cru&s;t about it; a &s;mall
Drop of concreted Blood may grow
to be a Stone, for by the Evapora|tion
of the mo&s;t fluid Parts it
grows hard, and by the Attraction
of new Matter increa&s;eth Blood,
and a Human Calculus, or Stone,
yield the &s;ame Contents by Chy|mical
Trial, tho' in an inver&s;e Or|der.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;tony Concretions happen
mo&s;t commonly in the Kidneys and
Bladder; and indeed if the Tartar
and other Contents of the Urine
were not con&s;tantly voided, &s;uch
Concretions would happen to every
Human Creature; for the Urine of
the mo&s;t &s;ound Per&s;on being in|&s;pected
with a Micro&s;cope, after it
has &s;tood a while, will di&s;cover a
black Speck, which is Sand, and
wherever this Sand &s;ticks it grows
&s;till bigger, by the appo&s;ition of
new Matter: When &s;uch Concre|tions
<PB N="421" REF="187">
happen in the Kidneys, and
are expell'd or drop into the Ure|ters,
it makes what we call Gra|vel;
when they lodge and &s;tick in
the Body of the Kidneys, and
grow to &s;uch a Bulk as not to
drop into the Pelvis, or pa&s;s by
the Ureters, they make the Stone
in the Kidneys: The Symptoms
of which are a dull Pain in the
Kidney, mo&s;t commonly bloody
Water; upon a &s;udden Jolt, vio|lent
Motion, Pain in Stooping; Pain
in the Thigh, Sickne&s;s in the Sto|mach,
Colical Pains, various Changes
in the Colour of the Urine, black,
bloody, pale, occa&s;ion'd by &s;ome|thing
&s;harp or &s;cabrous wounding the
&s;mall Blood-Ve&s;&s;els; if the Stone
is &s;mooth and well bedded, per|haps
this may not happen. Fle&s;hy
Filaments, or Matter voided by
Urine, are &s;u&s;picious Symptoms of
a Stone in the Kidney, e&s;pecially
<PB N="422" REF="188">
if the Patient has been &s;ubject to
Voiding of Gravel.</P>
<P>When a &s;mall Stone is lodg'd in
the Body of the Kidney, it does
not create Pain, nor much when it
falls into the Pelvis; but when it
falls into the Ureter, and &s;ticks,
the Pain is mo&s;t acute; it often
&s;tops at the Flexure and Valve of
the Ureter, and &s;ometimes in the
Urethra, or Pa&s;&s;age of the Urine
from the Bladder; while it &s;tays in
the Bladder it creates no Pain, but
remaining there long it grows a
confirm'd Stone, too big to be pa&s;s'd
by the Urethra: The manner of
its Concretion is by concentrical
Rings, like an Onion, about the
fir&s;t Kernel, which &s;hews the Cau&s;e
to be Attraction. This is not on|ly
true of a &s;mall Stone, but any
&s;olid Body lodg'd in the Bladder
will make the Kernel of a Stone;
the Experiment of a Bullet's pro|ducing
<PB N="423" REF="189">
this Effect has been try'd
upon a Dog; and &s;uch an Acci|dent
has happen'd to a Man by a
Wound, in which a Bullet has
dropt into the Bladder.</P>
<P>The Symptoms of a Stone in the
Bladder are a Titillation about the
Neck of the Bladder, and the Parts
thereabout; a frequent Needing to
make Water; a Sen&s;ation of Weight
in the lower Belly, under the Shear-Bone,
with a great Pain, e&s;pecially
upon any &s;udden Motion, which
cau&s;eth a Concu&s;&s;ion of the Blad|der,
a Dribling, Difficulty, and a
momentary Suppre&s;&s;ion of Urine by
the Stone, &s;hutting up the Orifice
of the Bladder, attended with a Te|ne&s;mus,
or needing to go to Stool,
and a burning Pain in the Urethra;
&s;ometimes a white Mucus in the Urine;
tho' this la&s;t Symptom will happen
without a Stone in the Bladder.</P>
<P><PB N="424" REF="190">
The Regimen in the Stone in
the Kidneys is by diluent and &s;oft
Diureticks to try to expel it, if it is
&s;mall enough to pa&s;s; if the Stone
is brittle, it will often crumble and
pa&s;s in the Form of Gravel; if the
Stone is too big to pa&s;s, the be&s;t
Method is to come to a &s;ort of a
Compo&s;ition or Truce with it; the
Diet ought to be cool and diluent,
as far as po&s;&s;ible to hinder its
Growth; to u&s;e Diureticks that gent|ly
re&s;olve, as Par&s;ley, Fennel, Scor|zonera,
Sa&s;&s;afras, Mallows, and Tea,
Dandelion, Cichory, Oats, Barley,
Honey, Honey and Vinegar; Ni|trous
Salts, as Spirit of dulcify'd
Nitre; the mo&s;t &s;oft cooling Dilu|ent
of all, is Whey; the be&s;t Emol|lients
are Decoctions of Mar&s;hmal|lows,
Lin&s;eed-Tea.</P>
<P>Bathing in tepid Water, Cly&s;ters,
&s;ea&s;oning the Aliment moderately
with Sea-Salt, for the immoderate
<PB N="425" REF="191">
U&s;e of it is re&s;olving and diuretick;
the Belly, in all Ca&s;es of the Stone,
ought to be kept lax and open.</P>
<P>In a confirm'd Stone of the Kid|neys
too violent Exerci&s;e is dange|rous.</P>
<P>During the pa&s;&s;ing of a Stone,
one &s;hould avoid at fir&s;t all &s;trong
Stimulating; relaxing and lubrica|ting
the Pa&s;&s;ages, and quieting the
Spa&s;ms by Opiats is certainly the
be&s;t Method; and where Bathing
cannot be conveniently had, Ox|Bladders,
half full of warm Water,
apply'd con&s;tantly to the affected
Part may be u&s;efully &s;ub&s;tituted.
Letting of Blood taketh off a Ten|&s;ion
better than any thing, and is
very nece&s;&s;ary where the Symptoms
are violent; when the Parts are &s;uf|ficiently
relax'd, &s;timulating Diure|ticks
may be us'd more &s;afely, e&s;pe|cially
if a&s;&s;ociated with Opiats.</P>
<P><PB N="426" REF="192">
As to Di&s;&s;olvents of the Stone,
all that have hitherto been propos'd
are chimerical; <HI>Helmont</HI> talks of Bulls
Blood; Goats Blood is rather a bet|ter
Di&s;&s;olvent.</P>
<P>The &s;ure&s;t way to hinder the
Generation of a Stone, is to pro|cure
a Diarrhoea by Whey, Broth,
and a liquid Diet; and indeed what
would not one do to prevent &s;o pain|ful
a Di&s;ea&s;e?</P>
<P>When the Stone is fallen to the
Bladder, Care &s;hould be taken to
make it pa&s;s as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible,
for the Rea&s;ons above-mention'd;
if all the Symptoms abate without
the pa&s;&s;ing of the Stone, it is not
certain that the Stone remains in
the Bladder, becau&s;e a very &s;mall
Stone may pa&s;s in&s;en&s;ibly by Urine;
if the Stone has pa&s;s'd, it is not cer|tain
that the Fit is over, for there are
often more, and the u&s;ual Remedies
ought not to be left off.</P>
<P><PB N="427" REF="193">
The Irritations of the Membranes
of the Bladder by a Stone, may be
much mitigated by the Injection of
the Oil of Lin&s;eed or Almonds, in|to
the Bladder.</P>
<P>Such as are &s;ubject to the Gravel
or Stone ought to be careful of their
Diet, to u&s;e &s;uch Aliments as gene|rate
a &s;mall Quantity of Foeces, or
relax the Belly; Aliment demulcent,
as Pea&s;e; a Decoction of Chick-Pea&s;e
is a Remedy in a Fit of the
Stone; they ought to drink Whey in
the Spring, and take Honey in &s;eve|ral
Forms, if it agrees with them;
Rice, Barley, Millet, are all good
in this Ca&s;e; nothing makes Stones
or Gravel pa&s;s more ea&s;ily than
Opiats.</P>
<P>If the Stone &s;ticks in the Ure|thra,
emollient Fomentation of the
Parts, Oil injected, or in ca&s;e of
great Extremity, an In&s;trument
with a Cavity like a &s;mall Spoon,
<PB N="428" REF="194">
dipt in Oil, may fetch out the
Stone.</P>
<P>The Stone in the Bladder is not
only a painful, but a mortal Di&s;|ea&s;e,
if not extracted. The Diet of
a Patient in &s;uch a Ca&s;e is &s;uch as of
a wounded Per&s;on, nouri&s;hing, with|out
Acrimony.</P>
<P>Let the Reader look into the Ar|ticle

where there are &s;ome Direc|tions
proper for all who are &s;ubject
to the Stone or Gravel.</P>

<P>The Di&s;ea&s;e &s;eems to be an in|flammatory

Arteries, and therefore af|fecting

<P>The common Methods us'd in

<P>As for the Diet, it ought to be

<P>If there be a &s;pecifick in Aliment
is certainly Whey; I knew a Per|&s;on
&s;ubject to this Di&s;ea&s;e who could
