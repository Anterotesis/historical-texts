<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Nature of this Work &s;eeming to render &s;omething of a Preface nece&s;&s;ary, I &s;hall, for that Rea&s;on, intirely dedicate it to the Ser|vice of the Reader, in as few Words as po&s;&s;ibly I can.</P>
<P>Having formerly written a &s;hort E&s;&s;ay u|pon the Royal Family of <HI>STEWART,</HI> to which was prefixed an Hi&s;torical Account and De&s;cription of the Shire of <HI>Renfrew:</HI> I had no &s;ooner publi&s;h'd that little Book; than &s;everal Per&s;ons of eminent Di&s;tinction for their Learning and Knowledge in the Antiquities of the Nation, for who&s;e Judgment I had the mo&s;t profound Regard, &s;et upon me to write <HI>A Peerage of SCOTLAND,</HI> a Book very much wanted; which at length, by their Importunity and promi&s;ed A&s;&s;i&s;tance, I was prevailed with to undertake.</P>
<P>When I fir&s;t &s;et about this Work, as I did entirely devote and dedicate my Time to the Study of Antiquities, particularly tho&s;e of our own Country, &s;o I made it my Bu&s;ine&s;s to collect all tho&s;e Hi&s;torical and Genealogical Tracts that had been done on the No|bility, that I could come to the Knowledge of. The Olde&s;t of that Kind I have met with, was a few loo&s;e Sheets on the Ge|nealogies
<PB N="4" REF="3">
of our Nobility, &s;aid to be done by <HI>James</HI> Lord <HI>Ochil|tree,</HI> in the Hands of my very worthy Friend, and one of our be&s;t Antiquaries, Mr. <HI>Baillie</HI> of <HI>Ca&s;tlecary;</HI> but the Accounts even of the few Families that Lord treats of, are very lame; and I ob&s;erve where he goes much higher than his own Time, they are purely traditional, and therefore I could not depend on them.</P>
<P>I peru&s;ed al&s;o the large Genealogical Collections concerning the Nobility, by Sir <HI>James Balfour,</HI> who was Lord Lyon King at Arms, in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. but they are written &s;o very loo&s;ely, and I have &s;een them contradicted &s;o frequently by Writs and Charters, that I give them but little Credit. I &s;up|po&s;e Sir <HI>James</HI> never intended the&s;e Papers &s;hould have gone fur|ther than his own Clo&s;et, for he was a Learned and Curious Gentleman, as appears from his Annals, in which he is much more exact, e&s;pecially as to what occurred in his own Time.</P>
<P>I procured likewi&s;e a Copy of the Hi&s;torical E&s;&s;ay on the Prin|cipal Families of the Kingdom, Alphabetically dige&s;ted, by the learned Lord Advocate, Sir <HI>George Mackenzie</HI> of <HI>Ro&s;ehaugh;</HI> but I apprehend the&s;e Papers have been only &s;ome fir&s;t Draught of a greater Work Sir <HI>George</HI> intended, which he lived not to fini&s;h: Of this there are many Copies in &s;everal Hands, the mo&s;t exact by very far of any of them I have &s;een, was that which I had the U&s;e of from <HI>Thomas Crawfurd</HI> of <HI>Cartsburn,</HI> my Brother, who by his own Reading and Knowledge in the Antiquities of the Nation, has rectified a great many of Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Mi&s;takes, at lea&s;t of his Amanuen&s;is, and has with great Accuracy, em|belli&s;hed his own Copy with a va&s;t deal of fine Hi&s;torical Re|marks, that it well de&s;erves the Character of a curious Ma|nu&s;cript.</P>
<P>I had moreover a Sight of the Genealogies of the Nobility, collected by Mr. <HI>Dunlop,</HI> the late Principal of the College of <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> who was Hi&s;toriographer for <HI>Scotland,</HI> a Gentle|man of great Integrity and Learning, and an excellent Antiquary. I under&s;tand he intended to have written <HI>A Peerage of SCOT|LAND,</HI> and for that End made very full Collections on that Subject: But I ob&s;erve that mo&s;t of Mr. <HI>Dunlop</HI>'s Accounts are compo&s;ed of tho&s;e Genealogical De&s;cents that the Nobility have in their own Families, and are handed about by their Friends; and that ingenious Gentleman did with great Accuracy and Judg|ment,
<PB N="5" REF="4">
add Hi&s;torical Memoirs to the Genealogies, which give them a great Ornament; and he is very exact as to his Autho|rities. The M.S. was communicated to me by my very worthy Friend, Mr. <HI>Dunlop,</HI> the pre&s;ent Profe&s;&s;or of <HI>Greek</HI> in the Uni|ver&s;ity of <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> the Principal's Son.</P>
<P>But after I had made all tho&s;e Collections I have mentioned, and a great deal more of that Kind, I cannot &s;tay to particu|larize, I found I had not any tolerable Foundation for the car|rying on the Work I had undertaken, for the Honour of the Country, (the De&s;ign it was principally for) or my own Repu|tation; and therefore, by the Advice and Direction of my in|genious Friends, who had engaged me in the De&s;ign, I did with as much Humility and Mode&s;ty as I was Ma&s;ter of, addre&s;s every Peer by my&s;elf or &s;ome Friend, for the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of their own Charters and Writings, to enable me to do their Families Ju&s;tice in this Undertaking.</P>
<P>Such Helps as I &s;ought were very generou&s;ly afforded me by the greater Part of the Nobility, who allowed me the Peru&s;al of their Charter-Che&s;ts and original Writings, from which I com|po&s;ed the Accounts of their Families as they &s;tand in my Book. Severals indeed I did not &s;ee; &s;ome were unwilling to &s;hew their Family Writs for divers Rea&s;ons, &s;ome were Minors, others were Abroad, and out of the Country; and even to &s;uch I have done all the Ju&s;tice was po&s;&s;ibly in my Power. But if the Ac|counts of &s;uch Families, who&s;e Charters I have not had Acce&s;s to, be &s;horter and le&s;s connected than others, that was what cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed I could help: I took Care timeou&s;ly to ad|verti&s;e every Body concerned, and if they did not incline to &s;hew me their Writs, the Blame cannot be laid on me.</P>
<P>But that I might be the better able to carry on the Work I had undertaken with Advantage, and to form Accounts of tho&s;e noble Families who&s;e Writs I had not &s;een, and to &s;upply, if a <HI>Hiatus</HI> did happen, (as it frequently did) in &s;uch Families who&s;e Writings I had peru&s;ed I &s;earched all the Publick Offices and Libraries about <HI>Edinburgh</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">By the Publick Offices I mean the Regi&s;ters of the Great Seal, which I peru&s;ed from the Charters of King <HI>Robert</HI> I. down to our own Times, in the Laigh Parliament-Hou&s;e, and in the Chancery; I look'd over al&s;o the Records of the Ju&s;ticiary, and all the Chartularies in the Lawyers Library.</NOTE>, and noted every Thing as ex|actly
<PB N="6" REF="5">
as I could; and the Keepers of the&s;e Offices were &s;o obliging as to allow me Acce&s;s at all Hours, ordinary and extraordinary, whenever I call'd, and to whom therefore I do, with all due Gratitude, return my mo&s;t humble and hearty Acknowledg|ments.</P>
<P>But after all my Labour, I am &s;o far from being &s;o vain as to imagine this E&s;&s;ay is not capable of any further Improvement, that on the contrary I am &s;en&s;ible, I have, thro' Inadvertency, and the Errors of the Pre&s;s, e&s;pecially in Dates and Proper Names of the pre&s;ent Age, fallen into many Mi&s;takes; but I beg the ingenious Reader will pardon the&s;e Omi&s;&s;ions, which are inevitable in &s;uch Books, and where he di&s;covers an Error, he will correct it with his Pen.</P>
<P>Perhaps &s;ome may think, that I have been fuller upon &s;ome Families, (even &s;ome that are extinct) than on others who are much more ancient than tho&s;e I enlarge more upon. The Rea&s;on is plain, the Repre&s;entatives, Relations, or De&s;cendents of tho&s;e noble Families &s;hew'd me their Writs, and encouraged my De|&s;ign. If others had done &s;o, I doubt not but I &s;hould have been able to have done them as full, and vouched them as well. For I can &s;ay, and do here declare on the Word of a Gentleman, That I had no Regard in the doing of Ju&s;tice in my Province as an Author, to the Encouragement I received from any Man, otherwi&s;e than to reckon my&s;elf very much obli|ged to &s;uch; and I own I did not &s;pare either Time or Pains to di&s;cover any Particular, I thought could give an Ornament to the Antiquity, or a Lu&s;tre to the Honour of their Families.</P>
<P>But where I have been a&s;&s;i&s;ted from the Publick Records or Authentick Hi&s;tory, I have been as full on tho&s;e Families who never incouraged the De&s;ign, as I have been upon tho&s;e who gave me the greate&s;t A&s;&s;i&s;tance every Way; and for the Truth of this, I can and do appeal to &s;everals of the Nobility them|&s;elves, who will find very long deduced, and well vouched De|&s;cents of their Families, in this Peerage, who never encouraged my Undertaking in any Degree. But as I &s;aid before, That I had had no Re&s;pect to; for my chief and only Regard was, and &s;hall be Truth, and the Honour of our Country, as far as I am capable to di&s;cover the one, or defend the other.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">
As to the Work it &s;elf, I &s;hall &s;ay nothing: But after &s;o great Labour, and Expence of Time, the E&s;&s;ay (being new and never before attempted) how defective &s;oever it may be, I cannot but hope, will meet with a favourable Reception from the Ingeni|ous, and more particularly have the Approbation and Coun|tenance of Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction, who frequently read &s;uch Books, and know how u&s;eful and acceptable Undertakings of this Kind have ever been accounted in all the Polite Nations of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>

Earl of <HI>Menteth,</HI> came to that Ho|nour, and had the Earldom of <HI>Fife,</HI> by the Re&s;ignation of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Fife;</HI> both which Titles he u&s;ed, till he was rais'd to a higher Honour.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Fife</HI> and <HI>Menteth</HI> was a Per&s;on of great Parts and Spirit, which he manife&s;ted in all his Actions, both in Peace and War. His Father the King had &s;o great an E&s;teem of his Abilities, that in his old Age, he made him Governor of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and he continued in the Admini&s;tration till the Death of the King.</P>
<P>Upon the Acce&s;&s;ion of his Bro|ther <HI>Robert</HI> III. to the Crown, the King being aged and valitudinary, thought fit to continue the Earl of <HI>Fife</HI> his Brother in the Regency, and further dignified him with the Title of Duke of <HI>Albany, Anno</HI> 1399, and he di&s;charged that great Tru&s;t very well throughout the Whole of his Brother's Reign; and the Prince King <HI>James</HI> I. being a Pri&s;oner in <HI>England</HI> at the Time of his Father's Death, the Duke came of Right to be Governor of the Kingdom, and he enjoyed the Office till his Death, <HI>September</HI> 3d, <HI>Anno</HI> 1420.</P>

<P>The Duke of <HI>Albany</HI> was &s;ucceeded by <HI>Murdack</HI> his Son, both in his E&s;tate and in the Government of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but he came very far &s;hort of his Fa|ther, for being a weak Man, and of &s;mall Parts, was &s;carce able to go|vern his own Family, much le&s;s the Kingdom: But that which &s;hould attone for all his Over&s;ights, and pre|&s;erve his Memory from all unkind Reflections, was the glorious Part he acted, in conducing &s;o much toward the Re&s;tauration of King <HI>James</HI> I. in which he was the great In&s;tru|ment. Not long thereafter, the King growing jealous of the Duke's Power, which no doubt was very great, and di&s;covering &s;ome trea&s;onable Intrigue in which he was concern'd, he was fir&s;t put under Arre&s;t, and &s;ent Pri&s;o|ner to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Carlaverock;</HI> and being &s;hortly after brought to his Trial, he was found guilty of High-Trea&s;on by his Peers, for which he lo&s;t his Head on the 19th <HI>May</HI> 1425.</P>

<P>This Name has been remarkable in our <HI>Scots</HI> Hi&s;tory on &s;everal other Occa&s;ions, particularly Sir <HI>Alexander Scrimgeor,</HI> was among the fir&s;t who took the Field for King <HI>Robert Bruce,</HI> and faithfully adhered to him; in Con&s;ideration whereof, when that valiant Prince came to be e&s;tabli&s;hed on the Throne, he gave him &s;undry Lands about the Burgh of <HI>Innerkeith|ing,</HI> then in the Crown, by the Attain|der of Sir <HI>Philip de Moubray,</HI> Knight.

<P>This Lord put him&s;elf in Arms in behalf of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and march|ed with him to the Battle of <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> 3<HI>d September</HI> 1651, after which he &s;uffered much for his Loyalty, but living to &s;ee the Re&s;tauration, he received &s;ome part of amends, being created Earl of <HI>Dundee, Anno</HI> 1661, and made one of the Privy Council. His Wife was <HI>Mary</HI> Daughter of <HI>William</HI> fir&s;t Earl of <HI>Dalhou&s;ie,</HI> but dying without I&s;&s;ue, in 1668, by rea&s;on of an Entail of his E&s;tate, which (purely thro' Inadvertency) ter|minated in the Heirs Male, the King &s;ucceeded thereto as <HI>ultimus haeres,</HI> and the Honour became extinct, and lay dormant till the Year 1688, that the Title of Vi&s;count of <HI>Dundee</HI> was be&s;towed on General <HI>Graham.</HI></P>

<HEAD>MACKDUFF, Thane, afterward Earl of <HI>Fyfe.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A Thane in Ancient Times, is thought by the learned <HI>Spel|man</HI> and <HI>Selden,</HI> to have been the King's principal Mini&s;ter in a Pro|vince, no doubt inve&s;ted with a Power of Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice, to which certain honourary Priviledges were annexed. 'Tis thought it was not at the fir&s;t In&s;titution, properly a Title of Dignity, but of Service. They were of two kinds, either &s;uch as &s;erved the King in greater Places of Emi|nency, who were called <HI>Thani Ma|jores,</HI> or <HI>Thani Regis,</HI> as the Thanes of <HI>Fife, Caithne&s;s, Argyle,</HI> and <HI>Murray</HI> were, the&s;e that &s;erved under them were termed <HI>Thani Minores:</HI> But when the Title of <HI>Comes</HI> and <HI>Dux</HI> be|came Hereditary (&s;o the Learned are of Opinion) the Title and Privi|leges of <HI>Thani Majores</HI> did de&s;cend with the Lands from Fathers to their Children, tho the le&s;&s;er did not, yet they &s;till retained the old Name of Thanes and Thanedoms, as the Ba|ronies of <HI>Boyn</HI> in <HI>Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ff</HI> &s;hire and <HI>Cal|der</HI> in <HI>Murray,</HI> &amp;c. are called to this Time: And perhaps the Difference betwixt the two con&s;i&s;ted in this, That the greater <HI>Thanes</HI> derived their Power and Authority immediately from the King, and held them of the Crown <HI>in capite,</HI> for Knights Service, which by a certain Con&s;titution made them Hereditary, and were of the &s;ame kind with them that after|ward came to be Parliamentary Ba|rons. The le&s;&s;er <HI>Thanes,</HI> had only Commi&s;&s;ions from them, and were held in the ordinary way for Services done, and to be done. All our Hi|&s;tories do agree, that <HI>Mackduff,</HI> former|ly <HI>Thane,</HI> was created Earl of <HI>Fyfe,</HI> by King <HI>Malcolme Canmore, Anno</HI> 1057<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Balfour and other Scots Hi&s;torians.</NOTE>, and that in Con&s;ideration of his ex|traordinary Services to that Prince, in a&s;&s;i&s;ting him to revenge his Fa|ther's Death upon <HI>Mackbeth,</HI> and to recover his Crown, for which he gave him and his Heirs the&s;e great and noble Privileges,</P>

From this we may remark how George Buchanan, and other Hi&s;torians who copy from him, are to be relyed on, who take Ma|terials and Vouchers of their Hi&s;tories from other Authors who have wrote before them, and never looked into the National Records, where proper Materials for a Hi&s;torian are to be found: For I cannot imagine that Mr. Buchanan ever gave him&s;elf the Trouble to turn over one Roll in the publick Archives of the Kingdom, otherwi&s;e he could not but have di&s;covered the Error of Robert III's Illegitmacy, and many other Things relating both to the Royal Family, as well as to this Noble Family I now write of; for &s;ince the Time of King Robert the Bruce the Records are pretty full, &s;o that if diligently peru&s;ed, would have rectified many very gro&s;s Errors all our old Hi&s;torians have fallen into, whom Buchanan, as to the Hi&s;tory, has followed exactly; for he only turned their Books into that ornate Latine Style we now read his Hi&s;tory of Scotland in. For I cannot imagine Buchanan &s;aw the Re|cords, otherwi&s;e he could not have been &s;o Wicked, or &s;o Perver&s;e an Hi&s;torian as to have concealed Matters of Fact &s;o evident there, and of &s;uch importance to the Royal Family, except ye &s;uppo&s;e, (as indeed many do) that he was well plea&s;ed to find that any before him had wrote of the illegitimacy of King Robert III, and thereby to make it a Precedent for the Succe&s;&s;ion of another Ba&s;tard to the Crown, who was his Patron, in Prejudice of the lawful Heirs; and James Duke of Chatlerault being then the pre&s;umptive Heir of the Crown failling of Queen Mary and her young Son King James VI. I believe Mr. Buchanan had a particular View to that in his malicious and fal&s;e A&s;per&s;ions again&s;t that mo&s;t Noble and Worthy Lord and his Family, both in his Hi&s;tory, and in another &s;currilous Pa&s;quil he wrote, entitul'd, <HI>An Admonition to the true Lords,</HI> and which is the mo&s;t fal&s;e, and mo&s;t &s;candalous writing that ever flowed from the Pen of any Man of the lea&s;t Worth, which &s;hall be an&s;wered el&s;ewhere, to the Conviction of any who will allow them&s;elves to believe Truth, all clearly made out from original Writings, accidentally come into my Hands.</NOTE>,</P>

Our Enemy, is he not the &s;ame old Inveterate One, who&s;e Avarice has, by Unju&s;t Wars, &s;o often attempted to Devour our Exi&s;tence? And is not this pre&s;ent War alone &s;ufficient to make us tremble at the very Thought of, falling under the Power of Tyrants &s;o uncon&s;cionably Implacable? We cannot de&s;cend to the Terms they propo&s;e, without &s;tooping under the Imperious Yoke of a People that thir&s;t for our Blood, and who&s;e In&s;olence is whetted with Fury. Ca&s;t your Eyes, on the other Hand, on your Ancient Unalterable Allies the <HI>French;</HI> they never yet fail'd us in our greate&s;t Exigencies, and will not in the pre&s;ent Juncture of our Affairs: Neither do we want Friends in <HI>Italy:</HI> Nay, there are few Potentates in <HI>Europe,</HI> that will unconcernedly look on and be|hold our De&s;truction. Re&s;olve, in fine, Whether we had be&s;t Defend our Liberties, or give them up; Whether 'tis mo&s;t expedient to die, if it mu&s;t be &s;o, Free and Indepen|dent, or to live Eternal Slaves to our greate&s;t Foes. 'Tis true, they offer us fair Things; our Laws and Rights are, by the Treaty, to re|main untouch'd: But pray, who is Guarrantee for this? And if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hall, in an After-game, either Break or Encroach upon the Articles agreed to, Who will Re|dre&s;s our Grievances? To what Tribunal &s;hall we appeal? 'Tis a Je&s;t to offer to &s;et up either for Liberty or Property, when in effect we &s;hall have given them away. We mu&s;t begin, by &s;urrendering our Mi&s;tre&s;s to a Husband, that is, to a Ma&s;ter; which done, I don't &s;ee why he may not, as &s;uch, &s;ub|ject her Crown to his own, or ra|ther Unite and Confound them in one: And thus <HI>Scotland</HI> mu&s;t in|evitably become a County or Pro|vince of <HI>England.</HI> 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible to reflect on the Ambitious Project without Horror and Dete&s;tation: And how can we choo&s;e, but to have the meane&s;t Sentiments of, and greate&s;t Contempt imaginable

<P>The Queen Mother was intirely in Sir <HI>Alexander</HI>'s Intere&s;t, and to effectuate her Purpo&s;e cometh from <HI>Stirling</HI> to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> pretending a friendly Vi&s;it to her Son, which the Chancellor very willingly allow|ed her in the Ca&s;tle &s;everal Days: During which Time &s;he cajolled the Prince into an Obedience to her Will, and the Chancellor into a Be|lief that &s;he de&s;igned nothing but what &s;he own'd: At length &s;he told the Chancellor, that &s;he would but &s;tay one Night longer in the Ca&s;tle, being the next Day to &s;et out for <HI>Whitekirk</HI> in <HI>Buchan,</HI> to perform a Vow which &s;he had made for the Health of the King, who&s;e Per&s;on &s;he earne&s;tly recommended to his Care till &s;he &s;hould return. He a&s;&s;ured her of his Fidelity both in that and all o|ther re&s;pects, and &s;o left her. Thus all Eyes, but tho&s;e of a tru&s;ty Few being a&s;leep, the young King was carefully put up in a Che&s;t among his Mother's Furniture, and then convoyed to <HI>Leith,</HI> and from thence by Water to <HI>Stirling;</HI> where Sir <HI>Alex|ander Living&s;ton,</HI> and tho&s;e of his Party received him with great Joy.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding this great Favour of the Queen's to Sir <HI>Alexander Living&s;ton,</HI> yet, for &s;ome Rea&s;ons of State, not long thereafter, he and &s;ome of his Friends did re|&s;train her Maje&s;ty in the Liberty &s;he had &s;ome while enjoyed of the Com|pany of her Son. Which her Maje&s;ty re&s;ented as a very high Indignity: But on the 4th of <HI>September</HI> 1439, the Bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;ettled betwixt the Queen and <HI>Living&s;ton</HI> by a &s;olemn In|denture &s;till extant in the Earl of <HI>Lin|lithgow</HI>'s Cu&s;tody: And becau&s;e it &s;eems very much to correct all our Hi&s;torians, even the very late&s;t Wri|ters of the Life of King <HI>James</HI> II. in the Chronology, and &s;ets the Hi&s;tory of that Prince's Minority in a truer light, than it has been hitherto done; I &s;hall here in&s;ert the original Inden|ture.</P>

<P>Sir <HI>Alexander Living&s;toun</HI> having thus got the young King into his Cu|&s;tody, in order to countenance his after Actions; he began to carry with a very high Hand, as being a&s;&s;ured that none would dare to controul him, in &s;o much that he created many Ene|mies to him&s;elf, and among the re&s;t the Queen Mother, whom upon Su&s;|picion or Pretence that &s;he and Sir <HI>James Stewart</HI> her Husband were carrying on &s;ome Intrigue with the Earl of <HI>Douglas,</HI> committed Sir <HI>James</HI> to Pri&s;on, and the Queen her &s;elf to a narrow Apartment in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Stirling,</HI> which &s;o much incen&s;ed her, that &s;he re&s;olv'd upon Revenge, and being as yet Mi&s;tre&s;s of her Son's Inclinations, very &s;oon brought a|bout a &s;econd Turn of Affairs at Court: For while Sir <HI>Alexander Living&s;ton</HI> was at <HI>Perth,</HI> employed in the pub|lick Affairs,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Drummond's Hi&s;t. of King James the II.</NOTE> She carried on a Plot &s;o clo&s;ely and dextrou&s;ly with the Chancellor, that one Morning as the King was Hunting in the Park of <HI>Sirling,</HI> his &s;mall Retinue were on a &s;udden &s;urrounded with a Body of about 4000 Hor&s;e commanded by the Lord Chancellor in Per&s;on, &s;o that the King was carried off, without any Oppo&s;ition, to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> where he was welcomed by the Acclamations of the People.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Alexander Living&s;ton,</HI> upon Advice of what had happened, came to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and wi&s;ely con&s;idering that the Chancellor could not more proba|bly &s;tand his Ground amid&s;t &s;o many Difficulties without him, than he had done without his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, he thought the be&s;t way was to endeavour to bring him to Terms of Accommo|dation, which by the Mediation of the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Aberdeen</HI> and <HI>Murray</HI> was at length effected; the Chancellor continuing in his Office as formerly, and the Cu&s;tody of the King's Per&s;on was again committed to Sir <HI>Alexander,</HI> which high Tru&s;t he executed with great Fidelity, till the 1444, that the King now arriv'd to the Age of 14 Years, began to govern in &s;ome Mea&s;ure by him&s;elf.

<P>When his Maje&s;ty had rai&s;ed an Ar|my again&s;t the Covenanters in 1639, and was advanced as far as the Bor|ders, my Lord <HI>Lowdon</HI> was one of the Peers who &s;igned an Addre&s;s to the King, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Lamenting their ill Fortune, that their Enemies had &s;o great Credit with his Maje&s;ty as to per|&s;wade him to believe that they were or could be di&s;obedient to him; a Thing that could never enter into their loyal Hearts; that they de&s;ired nothing but to be admitted into the Pre&s;ence of their gracious Sove|reign, to lay their Grievances at his Royal Feet, and leave the Deter|mination of them entirely to his own Wi&s;dom and Plea&s;ure."</Q></P>
<P>The Humility of the Stile wrought &s;o upon the King's Nature, who thought it great Pity that any Blood &s;hould be &s;pilt in a Contention which he him&s;elf might put an End to by his own Royal Word, as &s;oon as he &s;hould hear their Complaints; That he ea&s;ily con&s;ented to bring the Bu&s;ine&s;s to a fair Treaty, to which the Earl was named one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners up|on the Part of the Covenanters, and who accordingly met with &s;uch <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners as his Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to appoint at the <HI>Berks,</HI> where they entred upon, and concluded a Pa|cification, whereby <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Armies were to be disbanded; an Act of Oblivion pa&s;s'd; the King's Forts and Ca&s;tles to be re&s;tored, and a Parliament and a General A&s;&s;em|bly to be called, for a full Settle|ment, &amp; that thereby all Factions &amp; Animo&s;ities might be reconciled and compo&s;ed."</Q> But this Peace was of a very &s;hort Duration; for the Pacification being ill kept on both Sides, the King di&s;owning what had been &s;aid to have been tran&s;|acted upon his Part, and the Co|venanters remitting nothing of their
<PB N="286" REF="296">
Zeal again&s;t the Bi&s;hops and the Liturgy, having likewi&s;e entred a Pro|te&s;tation <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That they did not intend by any Thing contained in the Treaty to vacate any of the Pro|ceedings which had been in the late General A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI>:"</Q> By the&s;e Proceedings the Breach became greater and wider, and Preparations for War began to be renewed on both Sides with more Vigour than ever. But before Things &s;hould come to the la&s;t Extremity, and that, if po&s;&s;ible, Matters might be compo&s;ed without Blood, his Maje&s;ty thought fit to re+quire the Covenanters to &s;end &s;ome Per&s;ons intru&s;ted by their Body to at|tend him, to give an Account of their Proceedings, and which was the Thing they always mo&s;t de&s;ired. Accord|ingly certain Commi&s;&s;ioners were named, of which Number the Earl of <HI>Lowdon</HI> was one. At this Time when the Commi&s;&s;ioners repaired to <HI>London</HI> there happened to be a Letter inter|cepted, and tran&s;mitted to his Maje|&s;ty, that had been &s;igned by the Earl of <HI>Lowdon</HI> and the chief of the Cove|nanters, written to the <HI>French</HI> King, &amp; directed <HI>An Roy,</HI> a Stile only u&s;ed by Subjects to their natural King: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In which they complained of the Hard|ne&s;s &amp; Inju&s;tice of the Government that was exerci&s;ed over them, put him in mind of the Dependence <HI>Scotland</HI> formerly had upon that Crown, and de&s;ired him now to take them into his Protection, and give them A&s;&s;i&s;tance<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Clarendon's Hi&s;tory of the Civil War.</NOTE>."</Q> This Let|ter being &s;een and peru&s;ed by the Lords of the Council of <HI>England,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Lowdon</HI> being examin|ed, and refu&s;ing to give any other An&s;wer than, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That it was writ before the Agreement; and there|upon re&s;erved, and never &s;ent, that if he had committed any Offence, he ought to be que&s;tioned for it in <HI>Scotland,</HI> &amp; not in <HI>England;</HI> &amp; in&s;i&s;t|ing upon his &s;afe Conduct, demand|ed Liberty to return."</Q> But notwith|&s;tanding all the Defences the Earl was able to make, he was commit|ted Pri&s;oner to the Tower, and tho his Commitment was highly re&s;ented by the Parliament, as a Breach of the publick Faith, yet he continued in Pri&s;on &s;ome Months thereafter, till, by the Interpo&s;ition and Interce&s;&s;ion of the Marquis of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> he was en|larged on the 27<HI>th</HI> of <HI>June</HI> 1640<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Burnet's Hi&s;tory of the two Dukes of Hamilton.</NOTE>, when his Lord&s;hip renewed all Pro|fe&s;&s;ions of Duty to the King, and a Readine&s;s to engage in his Service, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">oon as he &s;hould return to his native Country, (where his Power &amp; Intere&s;t was as great as any Mans,) which he did by di&s;po&s;ing all tho&s;e upon whom he had Influence to hearken to all Over tures for a Peace with his Maje&s;ty. But notwith&s;tanding all the Endea|vours of the Lord <HI>Lowdon</HI> and others, who heartily de&s;ired an Accommoda|tion, Matters came to a &s;econd Rup|ture, and upon a Party of the Cove|nanters having routed the Lord <HI>Con|way</HI> at <HI>Newburn,</HI> who appeared for the King, and having taken <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> they thought fit after that to pre|&s;ent a humble Petition and Addre&s;s to the King for a new Treaty, which his Maje&s;ty conde&s;cending to, and <HI>Rippon</HI> being named the Place of Meeting, the Earl of <HI>Lowdon</HI> was appointed one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners for the Treaty. But all they they did there was only to agree to a Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms, a &s;afe Conduct being granted to his Lord&s;hip and the re&s;t of his Collegues for going to <HI>London</HI> to carry on and conclude the Treaty there: Which they did with all po&s;&s;ible Dili|gence, and which his Maje&s;ty confir|med, and the Lords of the Privy Coun|cil were made the Con&s;ervators of the Peace, during the Interval of Par|liaments.</P>
<P>The Peace betwixt the two Nations being thus happily concluded, it was judged nece&s;&s;ary that the Treaty
<PB N="283" REF="297">
&s;hould be ratified by the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which in the 1641, his Ma|je&s;ty was plea&s;ed to hold him&s;elf in his own Royal Per&s;on, for the full Sa|tisfaction of his People, and where|in all Particulars that had been in Di&s;pute were adju&s;ted to the &s;eem|ing Joy and Satisfaction of every Man, and the Security of all that was then e&s;tabli&s;hed was &s;ufficiently provided for. In the End of the Se&s;&s;ion his Ma|je&s;ty was plea&s;ed to be&s;tow Honours and Offices on &s;ome principal Per|&s;ons, who had merited well at his Hands, and who were be&s;t able to &s;erve him; &s;o the Chancellour's Place was be&s;towed upon the Lord <HI>Lowdon,</HI> during Life, and that with the full Con&s;ent and Approbation of the Par|liament<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Re&s;cinded Acts of Parliament.</NOTE>, who looked on him, as he was throughout the whole Kingdom, as a very wi&s;e Man, excellently fitted and qualified for the Di&s;charge of that great Tru&s;t, as the Exigence of Affairs then &s;tood.</P>
<P>When the Civil War broke out in <HI>England,</HI> the Chancellour repaired to the King at <HI>York</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Clarendon's Hi&s;tory.</NOTE>, when his Maje&s;ty did &s;o fully &s;atisfy his Lord&s;hip with the Ju&s;tice and Honour of his Carriage toward his <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament, that he wrote to the <HI>Scots</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners at <HI>London,</HI> in the Name and by the Directi|on of the Lords of the Secret Council; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That they &s;hould pre&s;ent to the two Hou&s;es, the deep Sen&s;e they had of the Injuries and Indignities which were offered to the King, who&s;e ju&s;t Rights they were bound to de&s;end, and that they &s;hould conjure them to bind up tho&s;e Wounds which were made, and not to widen them by Sharpne&s;s of Language, and to give his Maje&s;ty &s;uch real Security for his Safety among them, by an effectual declaring again&s;t Tumults, and &s;uch other Actions as were ju&s;t|ly offen&s;ive to his Maje&s;ty, that he might be induced to re&s;ide nearer to them, and comply with them in &s;uch Propo&s;itions as &s;hould be rea&s;onably made<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>."</Q> Soon after which, taking leave of the King, his Lord&s;hip renew|ed all imaginable Profe&s;&s;ions of Duty to his Maje&s;ty, and a Readine&s;s to in|gage in his Service; which the King was very well a&s;&s;ured he could do.</P>
<P>In the 1643, the Chancellour was &s;ent Commi&s;&s;ioner from the Privy Council of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who called them|&s;elves <HI>the Con&s;ervators of the Peace be|tween the two Kingdoms,</HI> to his Maje&s;ty while he was at <HI>Oxford,</HI> de&s;iring to pa&s;s as a Mediator betwixt the King and the two Hou&s;es in <HI>England,</HI> when his Lord&s;hip u&s;ed all Importunity and Arguments to per&s;wade the King in private to con&s;ent to the Alteration of the Government of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> a&s;&s;uring him that it would be a Mean not only to hinder the Sub|jects of <HI>Scotland</HI> from adhering to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament, but that it would oblige them to a&s;&s;i&s;t his Maje&s;ty to the outmo&s;t, in the Vindication of all his Rights: But he found the King too &s;trongly fixed to be &s;way'd, in what he thought a Ca&s;e of Con&s;cience, by a Con&s;ideration of Convenience.</P>
<P>He then betook him&s;elf to his own proper Errand, which con&s;i&s;ted of two Parts; the one, to offer the Media|tion of the Con&s;ervators of the Peace of the Kingdom, for the Compo&s;ure of the Differences between his Maje|&s;ty and the two Hou&s;es; the other, to de&s;ire his Maje&s;ty that he would &s;ummon a Parliament in <HI>Scotland.</HI> In An&s;wer to the fir&s;t Demand of Medi|ation; His Maje&s;ty told him, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he could not find any colour or pretence of Authority granted by the Act of Pacification, by which the Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> could conceive them&s;elves intere&s;t|ed in a Faculty of Mediation; that the Clau&s;e mentioned by them re|lated only to the Differences that might grow between the two Nati|ons, which his Maje&s;ty &s;aid had
<PB N="284" REF="298">
been and &s;hould be inviolably ob|&s;erved by him; and therefore he could not admit of any &s;uch Medi|ation as they propo&s;ed."</Q> For the other Demand, of a Parliament in <HI>Scotland;</HI> The King told him and the re&s;t of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That again&s;t the Time by which they could legally demand a Parliament, naming the Day, which was to be on the fir&s;t Tue&s;day of <HI>June</HI> 1644, he would i&s;&s;ue out his Writs, and there being no emergent Cau&s;e to do it &s;ooner, he would forbear to put his Subjects there to that Trouble, which tho&s;e Meetings (how nece&s;&s;ary &s;oever) would na|turally carry with them."</Q> So his Lord&s;hip perceiving that he &s;hould not receive Satisfaction in either of the&s;e Propo&s;als, at la&s;t returned home <HI>re infecta.</HI></P>
<P>In the 1644, when his Maje&s;ty did renew his Offer of Peace to the two Hou&s;es of Parliament, which they likewi&s;e agreeing to, and <HI>Uxbridge</HI> be|ing a&s;&s;igned for the Place of Meeting, the Chancellour, the Earl of <HI>Lawder|dale,</HI> Sir <HI>Charles Erskine,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Ro|bert Barclay</HI> Member of Parliament for the Burgh of <HI>Irvine,</HI> and Mr. <HI>A|lexander Hender&s;on</HI> (in Matters only which related to the Church) were &s;ent Commi&s;&s;ioners from <HI>Scotland:</HI> But that Treaty unhappily coming to nothing, a bloody civil War thereupon en&s;ued.</P>
<P>When the King put him&s;elf into the <HI>Scots</HI> Army before <HI>New|wark,</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> po&s;itively de|manded the Delivery up of the King's Per&s;on, the Earl of <HI>Lowdon</HI> was ap|pointed to treat with the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> about that important Af|fair, where, in a free Conference with the two Hou&s;es, he publickly declar|ed, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That an eternal Infamy would ly upon the whole Nation, if they &s;hould deliver up the Per&s;on of the King, the &s;ecuring of which was equally their Duty, as it was the Parliament's, and the Di&s;po&s;al of his Per&s;on in order to that Securi|ty, did equally belong to them as to the Parliament: However he &s;aid, he would u&s;e all the Per&s;wa|&s;ion, and all the Importunity he could with the King, that his Ma|je&s;ty might yield and con&s;ent to the Propo&s;itions the Parliament had &s;ent to him."</Q></P>
<P>In the 1647, the Lord Chancel|lour was one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners appointed to attend the King from the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> while he was at the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> to treat with his Maje&s;ty anent a full Accomodati|on with that Kingdom, and which they at la&s;t concluded on Terms of great Advantage to the Nation; in Recompen&s;e of which, the Chancel|lour and his Collegues undertook to rai&s;e an Army to re&s;cue and relieve his Maje&s;ty from the Captivity he was then under, and to re&s;tore him to his ju&s;t Rights, and that no Time might be lo&s;t, as &s;oon as the Treaty was &s;ign|ed, the Chancellour departed for <HI>Scotland,</HI> where (at fir&s;t) he u&s;ed his outmo&s;t Endeavours to procure &s;uch Per&s;ons to be elected Members to the Parliament, as he knew to be mo&s;t inclined to the Service in hand, in which the Honour of the Country was &s;o much concerned.</P>
<P>When the Parliament met on the 2d of <HI>March</HI> 1648<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Re&s;cinded Acts.</NOTE>, the Lord Chancel|lour was cho&s;en Pre&s;ident of the Con|vention, wherein he employed all his Power and Intere&s;t to bring the Par|liament to comply with the Engage|ment &amp; declare for the King; &amp; tho the Affair met with great Oppo&s;ition, yet the Re&s;olution was carried in put|ting the Country in a Po&s;ture Defence, and rai&s;ing an Army to relieve the King. I need not here recount the Fate of that Army which marched in|to <HI>England</HI> under the Conduct of the Duke of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> nor how un&s;ucces|full it proved for the De&s;ign it was in|tended.<NOTE PLACE="foot">(<HI>b</HI>) Cromwel's Indemnity to the People of Scotland.</NOTE>
<PB N="285" REF="299">
All I &s;hall further ob&s;erve is, that as there had been a Party in the Parliament whom the King's Conce&s;|&s;ions did not &s;atisfy, &s;o they declared again&s;t the Engagement as unlawfull and ungodly, and the violent Party of the Clergy joining with them, they pa&s;&s;ed an Act again&s;t the <HI>Engagers,</HI> that was, all tho&s;e who had been the Promo|ters of it, ranking them into &s;everal <HI>Cla&s;ses,</HI> whereby they were exclu|ded from all Offices of publick Tru&s;t, and vote in Parliament till they had &s;atisfied the Church by a publick Pro|fe&s;&s;ion of their Repentance, for their Acce&s;&s;ion to the <HI>unlawfull Engagement</HI> as it was called.</P>
<P>When the Parliament met, after the Murder of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. the Lord Chancellour was cho&s;en Pre&s;i|dent of that Se&s;&s;ion, who by their 14 Act, proclaimed King <HI>Charles</HI> II. 'Tis beyond all Doubt the Chancel|lour gave all imaginable A&s;&s;i&s;tance he could to bring over the King from <HI>Holland,</HI> and to rai&s;e the Army that marched with his Maje&s;ty into <HI>Eng|land,</HI> but that Army being unhappily defeated at <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> and the U&s;urpers ab&s;olutely prevailing over all the three Kingdoms; the Chancellour was not only outed of his Office, but was for ced, for the Security of his Per&s;on, to fly to the <HI>Highlands,</HI> where he lay concealed, till the Earl of <HI>Glencairn</HI> by vertue of his Maje&s;ty's Commi&s;&s;ion drew together a &s;mall Body of Hor&s;e and Foot for his Maje&s;ty's Service, that the Earl of <HI>Lowdon</HI> repaired to him, for which he was for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eited by the Powers that then prevailed; and thereafter when <HI>Cromwel</HI> granted an Indemnity to the People of <HI>Scotland,</HI> both the Earl of <HI>Lowdon</HI> &amp; the Lord <HI>Ma+chline</HI> his Son were particularly excep|ted.

<P>Upon his Acce&s;&s;ion to the Honour, through the Demi&s;e of his Father, tho he was but then a very young Man, he had &s;o fair a Reputation, and was &s;o generally well e&s;teemed, that the Queen Regent thought fit in the 1553,<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Dr. Ander&s;on's Hi&s;tory of Scotland MS. in Biblioth jurid Edin.</NOTE> to give his Lord&s;hip the Command of the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> in which Station he behaved &s;o well, that he pre&s;erved him&s;elf in the good Opi|nion of the Queen's Maje&s;ty, and the whole Nation.</P>
<P>When Queen <HI>Mary</HI> returned from <HI>France Anno</HI> 1561, her Maje&s;ty hav|ing made Choice of a new Privy Council, my Lord <HI>Erskine</HI> was named one of that Number, in which Stati|on he &s;oon rendred him&s;elf very gracious to the Queen, in&s;omuch that &s;he made him a Grant of the Abbey of <HI>Inchmachomoe</HI> and diver&s;e other Church Lands then newly di&s;|&s;olved. His Intere&s;t at Court now being very great, he thought it a favourable Opportunity, and a pro|per Sea&s;on for him to renew his Claim to the Earldom of <HI>Mar,</HI> and having made good a Title through a long deduced Pedigree from <HI>Gratney</HI> Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> his Preten&s;ions being &s;upported by the Queen's Countenance,
<PB N="303" REF="313">
his Claim was allowed and ratified by Act of Parliament: And tho' my Lord <HI>Mar</HI> was a very zealous Prote|&s;tant, 'tis worthy our Remark, Queen <HI>Mary</HI> tru&s;ted him as much as &s;he could have done any of her own Profe&s;&s;ion, which &s;he did eminently manife&s;t by the Confidence &s;he repo|&s;ed in him, for as &s;oon as &s;he was hap|pily delivered of the Prince, <HI>James</HI> VI. her Maje&s;ty committed him to the Tuition and Cu&s;tody of the Earl, in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> then under his Command, and he di&s;charged that great Tru&s;t &s;o well, and was &s;o much &s;uperior to all Tentations of Infidelity that when the Earl of <HI>Bothwell</HI> had married the Queen, he could not pre|vail with my Lord <HI>Mar,</HI> either by Pro|mi&s;es or Menaces, to deliver up the Prince to him, which was the Thing in the World, that wicked Earl had &s;et his Heart mo&s;t upon, when 'tis known his Lord&s;hip could have made his own Terms: In the End, when <HI>Bothwell</HI> found all his Offers rejected, he was glad to allow the Earl to carry the Prince to <HI>Stirling</HI>-Ca&s;tle, of which he him&s;elf was heritable Governor, and then delivered up <HI>Edinburgh</HI> Ca&s;tle to <HI>Bothwell,</HI> on the 21&s;t of <HI>May,</HI> 1566, who immediately plac'd a Crea|ture of his own, Sir <HI>James Balfour,</HI> in it, by which Means, the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> became, under God, the happy In&s;tru|ment of the Prince's miraculous Pre|&s;ervation, during his long Minority: However, he &s;till retained great Duty and Affection to the Queen, even af|ter Things came to an Extremity; &s;o it would appear, that nothing but a pure Principle of Con&s;cience for the Pre&s;ervation of the Heir of the King|dom, fir&s;t engaged his Lord&s;hip in the Company of tho&s;e who &s;et the Crown upon the Head of the Prince, when he was an Infant little more than one Year old. When the Civil War began, I do'nt find this generous and prudent Lord much engaged on either Side, for his particular Province being to take Care of his Royal Pupil, he &s;tay'd him&s;elf much with him, and as he grew up in Years, gave him a Princely Education, appointing the famous Mr. <HI>Buchannan,</HI> Mr. <HI>Peter Young,</HI> Mr. <HI>David Eriskine,</HI> Commen|dator of <HI>Cambu&s;kenneth,</HI> and Mr. <HI>A|dam Erskine,</HI> Commendator of <HI>Dry|burgh,</HI> to be his In&s;tructors, Gentle|men who wanted none of tho&s;e Qua|lities which were to be wi&s;hed to be in the Per&s;ons to whom the Education of a great and hopeful Prince was com|mitted, and for framing his Mind and Manners, in his young and tender Years.</P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Mar</HI> bore no publick Of|fice in the State till the 1571, that upon the Death of <HI>Matthew</HI> Earl of <HI>Lennox,</HI> the Regent, the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> was a Nobleman &s;o generally well e&s;teemed, that he was, by the unanimous Con|&s;ent of the King's Party, cho&s;en Re|gent of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in his Room, <HI>Sept.</HI> 5, 1571. In which great Office he had, &s;ays one, <HI>Le&s;s Satisfaction than he expected, for when he had &s;trugled no le&s;s under the turbulent Councils of his own Party, than the In&s;olencies of his Adver&s;aries, died for very Grief, after he had governed only Thirteen Months, upon the</HI> 28<HI>th of</HI> October 1572, <HI>and left behind him &s;o unblemi&s;hed a Reputation, as cannot be very ea&s;ily parallel'd in the like Circum&s;tances:</HI> He was interr'd in the Vault of his Family, among his Ance&s;tors, in the Paroch Church of <HI>Alloa,</HI> under a plain Monument, with|out any other In&s;cription, than &s;igni|fying him to be the Per&s;on there in|terr'd.</P>
<P>To <HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> &s;ucceeded <HI>John</HI> his Son, then under Age, of whom I have found little memorable, till the 1582, his Lord&s;hip being then very young, he was induced to join with others of the di&s;contented Nobi|lity, who &s;eized on the King at <HI>Ruth|ven</HI>-Ca&s;tle, and petition'd his Maje&s;ty, that he would remove Sir <HI>James Stew|art,</HI>

who then &s;tiled him&s;elf Earl of <HI>Arran,</HI> from his Councils, being a Per&s;on of evil Fame, and Di&s;affection to the publick Peace of the Kingdom, and an In&s;trument of Di&s;content between the King and his Nobility: But the Way and Manner of that Enterprize being afterwards adjudged trea&s;o|nable, the Earl was obliged to give up the Command of <HI>Stirling</HI>-Ca&s;tle, and to leave his Maje&s;ty's Dominions, which he did, and tran&s;porting him|&s;elf into <HI>Ireland,</HI> from whence he came over to <HI>England,</HI> and joined the the Lord <HI>Hamiltoun,</HI> and others who had been outlaw'd during the Regency of the Earl of <HI>Mortoun,</HI> with whom he returned to <HI>Scotland Anno</HI> 1585, when he obtained his Maje&s;ty's Pardon, was re&s;tored to his Command of <HI>Stirling</HI>-Ca&s;tle, and to a more than ordinary Share of his Maje&s;ty's Favour, which his Lord&s;hip never afterward forfault|ed by any undutiful Behaviour.</P>

<P>His Maje&s;ty, upon his Acce&s;&s;ion to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> did not for|get to di&s;pen&s;e his Royal Favours to his Lord&s;hip: More particularly, he began with conferring the Garter u+pon him, the En&s;igns of which he was inve&s;ted with on St. <HI>George</HI>'s Day, <HI>A|pril</HI> 23d, 1603, and &s;hortly thereafter cau&s;ed him to be &s;worn of his Maje|&s;ty's mo&s;t honourable Privy-Council of <HI>England,</HI> and made him a Grant of &s;undry Abbacies and other Church-Lands then di&s;&s;olved from the Crown.

<P><HI>James</HI> Earl, afternam'd Marquis of <HI>Montro&s;e,</HI> was born in the 1612, hav|ing had the Misfortune to lo&s;e his Fa|ther when he was young, and being I think the only Son of the Family, his Friends, in order to rai&s;e up Heirs to his illu&s;trious Hou&s;e, pre|vail'd with him, when he was but a Youth, to marry, which he did into a very noble Family: This Marriage broke off the Cour&s;e, and gave a great Interruption to his Studies, but quick|ly finding the Lo&s;s he &s;hould &s;u&s;tain if he did not go thro' with his Edu|cation, he got good Ma&s;ters at Home, and enter'd into a clo&s;e Cour&s;e of Study, wherein he made &s;o great a Proficiency and Progre&s;s, that in a very little Time he became not only a great Ma&s;ter, but a Critick in the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> after which, for his greater Improvement, and giving an Ornament to his hopeful Per&s;on, he travel'd into Foreign Parts, where he &s;pent &s;ome Years in attaining the Language, and in learning the Exer|ci&s;es then in Vogue, in which he ex|cel'd mo&s;t Men, and came over to <HI>England,</HI> by the Time he was Twen|ty two Years of Age.</P>

both his Birth and per&s;onal Qualifica|tions did intitle him to; but in his Attendance there, meeting with &s;ome Di&s;countenance of the King, which was very artfully brought about, he left the Court, and returning to <HI>Scot|land,</HI> ju&s;t before the breaking out of the Troubles, he joined with the di&s;|contented Party, who appeared mo&s;t forward for the Redre&s;s of Grievan|ces of the Church, which was all that was at that Time pretended, in&s;omuch as he &s;oon became one of the prin|cipal and mo&s;t active Lords for the Covenant and Reformation: But af|ter the fir&s;t Expedition of the Cove|nanters into <HI>England,</HI> the Earl upon his Ob&s;ervation of the unwarrantable Pro&s;ecution of the Ends of the Cove|nant, he gave over that Party, and his Command in the Army; and made a full Tender of his Service to his Maje&s;ty, which brought him &s;o much into the Jealou&s;y of the Party he had formerly been of, that there was no Room left to doubt of his Sincerity to the King.

<P>The Alarm of <HI>Montro&s;e</HI>'s Landing &s;tartled the Parliament, which was then &s;itting at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> in &s;o much, that it gave them no Lei&s;ure to think of any Thing el&s;e, than of &s;ending Forces to hinder the Recour&s;e of others to join with him; and there|fore, &s;ent Colonel <HI>Strachan</HI> with a choice Party of the be&s;t Hor&s;e they had, to make all po&s;&s;ible Ha&s;te to|ward him, and to prevent the In&s;ur|rections which they feared would be in &s;everal Parts of the <HI>Highlands;</HI> and within few Days after, Lieutenant General <HI>Le&s;ly</HI> followed with a &s;trong|er Party of Hor&s;e and Foot.

<P>When he came to one of the Gates of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> he was met by &s;ome of the Magi&s;trates, to whom he was de|livered, and by them pre&s;ently put in|to a new Cart purpo&s;ely made, in which there was a high Chair, or Bench, upon which he &s;at, that the People might have a full View of him, being bound with a Cord drawn over his Brea&s;t and Shoulders, and fa&s;ten'd thro' Holes made in the Cart. When he was in this Po&s;ture, the Hangman took off his Hat, and rode him&s;elf before the Cart in his Livery, and with his Bonnet on; the other Officers, who were taken Pri&s;oners with him, walking Two and Two before the Cart; in this Manner he was carried to the common Goal, and received and treated as a common Malefactor.</P>
<P>Within Two Days after, he was brought before the Parliament, where the Chancellor made a very bitter

and virulent Speech again&s;t him, told him, <HI>He had broken all the Covenants by which the Nation &s;tood obliged, and had impiou&s;ly rebelled again&s;t GOD, the King and the Kingdom; that he had committed many horrible Murthers, Trea|&s;ons and Impieties, for all which he was now brought to &s;uffer condign Puni&s;h|ment;</HI> with all tho&s;e Reproaches, &s;ays my Author, again&s;t his Per&s;on and his Actions, which the Liberty of that Place gave him Leave to u&s;e.</P>

<P>A&s;&s;oon as he had ended his Di&s;|cour&s;e, he was ordered to withdraw; and, after a &s;hort Space, was again brought in; and told by the Chan|cellor, <HI>That he was, on the Morrow, be|ing the one and Twentieth of</HI> May 1650, <HI>to be carried to</HI> Edinburgh <HI>Cro&s;s, and there to be hanged up on a Gallows Thirty Foot high, for the Space of Three Hours, and then to be taken down, and his Head to be cut off upon a Scoffold, and hanged on</HI> Edinburgh <HI>Tolboth; his Legs and Arms to be hanged up in other publick Towns of the Kingdom, and his Body to be buried at the Place where he was to be executed, except the Kirk &s;hould take off his Excommunication; and then his Body might be buried in the common Place of Burial.</HI> And 'tis admirable to con&s;ider with what Magnanimity &amp; Firmne&s;s of Soul he heard the Judgment that condemned him to be quartered, con|cerning which he &s;aid to the Chancellor that pronounced it, <HI>That he was prouder to have his Head &s;et upon the Place it was appointed to be, than he could have been to have had his Picture hang in the King's Bed-Chamber: That he was &s;o far from being troubled, that his Four</HI>

<HI>Limbs were to be hang'd in Four princi|pal Cities of the Kingdom, that he hear|tily wi&s;hed he had Fle&s;h enough to be &s;ent to every City in</HI> Chri&s;tendom, <HI>as a Te&s;timony of the Cau&s;e for which he &s;uffer'd.</HI></P>
<P>He de&s;ir'd after the Sentence to have &s;aid &s;omewhat to the Parlia|ment, but was not &s;uffer'd, and &s;o was carried back to Pri&s;on; and the next Day every Part and Circum|&s;tance of the Sentence was executed upon him with all the Inhumanity imaginable; and he bore it with all the Courage and Magnanimity, and the greate&s;t Piety that a good Chri|&s;tian could manife&s;t. When he had ended all he had to &s;ay, and was ex|pecting to expire, they acted yet one Scene more of their Barbarity upon him; the Hangman brought the Book that had been publi&s;hed, of his truly Heroick Actions whil&s;t he comman|ded in the Kingdom, which, together with his Declaration, was tied in a &s;mall Cord, that was put about his Neck. At this new In&s;tance of their Malice the Marquis &s;mil'd, and thanked them for it, and &s;aid, <HI>he was glad it &s;hould be there, and was prouder of wearing it, than ever he had been of the Garter.</HI> and &s;o renewing &s;ome devote Ejacu|lations, he patiently endured the la&s;t Act of the Executioner.</P>

<P>This noble Lord was too young to have had a Part in the War under his Father: After who&s;e Death being dive&s;ted of his E&s;tate, he liv'd quietly and privately under the Powers that then prevail'd, retaining his Affection and Fidelity to the Crown, which he made manife&s;t in performing all the Offices of Fidelity and Duty to the King, throughout the whole Cour&s;e of the U&s;urpation, that a generous and worthy Per&s;on could find any Opportunity for; with which his Ma|je&s;ty was abundanty &s;atisfied and pleas'd.</P>

<P>In the 1558. the Earl of <HI>Morton</HI> was one of the Peers who entered into a Bond of A&s;&s;ociation to promote the Reformation of Religion, and the Year thereafter was &s;ent Amba&s;&s;ador to <HI>Eng|land</HI> to treat with Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> a|bout the maintaining a firm and la&s;ting Peace betwixt the Two Crowns, when he e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf &s;o much in the Favour of that Prince&s;s, that her Friend&s;hip was never in any Degree dimini&s;hed toward him till his dying Day.</P>
<P>After Queen <HI>Mary</HI> returned home from <HI>France</HI> in 1561, her Maje&s;ty made Choice of the Earl as one of her Privy-Council, and in le&s;s than a Year thereafter, he was &s;ent Amba&s;&s;a|dor to the Queen of <HI>England,</HI> in which Negotiation he behaved him&s;elf with great Prudence and Dexterity, in&s;o|much as upon his Return he was pre|fer'd to be Lord High-Chancellor; and he continued in the Office till the 20th of <HI>March</HI> 1565, he was deprived, and forced to flee to <HI>England,</HI> for alled|ged Acce&s;&s;ion to the Murder of <HI>David Rizio,</HI> the Queen's <HI>French</HI> Secretary:
<PB N="352" REF="362">
But in a &s;hort Time thereafter, by the Mediation and Interpo&s;ition of the Earl of <HI>Bothwell,</HI> he obtained his Par|don, which he paid dear for after|ward; for that Earl thought by this Favour, to bring the Earl of <HI>Morton</HI> over to his Intere&s;t; but he &s;oon found him&s;elf mi&s;taken.

And I think the Earl of <HI>Morton</HI>'s Circum&s;tances at this Time, cannot but be pitied; for if he had re|vealed the Earl of <HI>Bothwel</HI>'s De&s;ign of taking away the King's Life, it had co&s;t him his own; and his conceal|ing it then, brought him to die upon a Scaffold many Years there|after.</P>

<P>He was the natural Son of King <HI>James</HI> V. by <HI>Margaret,</HI> Daughter of <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Erskine,</HI> who being by the Care of his Father as of all the re&s;t of his illegitimate Sons were, bred to the Church; he was when very young provided to the Priory of St. <HI>Andrews, Anno</HI> 1539, then void by the Promo|tion of <HI>Patrick Hepburn,</HI> to the Epi&s;|copal See of <HI>Murray;</HI> but by Rea&s;on of his Non-age, Dr. <HI>Alexander Miln,</HI> Abbot of <HI>Cambuskenneth,</HI> and Pre&s;i|dent of the College of Ju&s;tice, was ap|pointed Admini&s;trator of the Benefice,<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Charta in Pub.

<P>By Rea&s;on of the Prior's Youth, I have met with nothing memorable of him, till the Beginning of the Refor|mation, he was among the fir&s;t who embraced the Prote&s;tant Reform'd Religion, tho'he was far from giving any Countenance to the Popular Re|formation, as is manife&s;t from the many and frequent Addre&s;&s;es he and others of the Prote&s;tant Nobility, made to the Queen Regent, that &s;he would plea&s;e to concur by her Autho|rity in reforming of the Church.</P>
<P>But the Queen peremptorily refu|&s;ing not only to comply with their Supplications, but having al&s;o violated &s;ome Articles of Pacification, &s;he had very &s;olemnly enter'd into with the Prote&s;tant Lords, of which the Prior of St. <HI>Andrews</HI> him&s;elf &s;tood Guaran|tee; he thereupon left her, and join'd him&s;elf with <HI>the Lords of the Congre|gation,</HI> as they were call'd, whereupon the Prior, the Lord <HI>James,</HI> was &s;um|mon'd before the Council, but he did not think fit to an&s;wer the Charge o|therwi&s;e, than to return this An&s;wer to the Me&s;&s;enger, <HI>That her Maje&s;ty had broken the Conditions with the Lords of the Congregation, which by Warrant from her&s;elf, he had made and entred into with them, he would have no more Med|dling in &s;uch di&s;hone&s;t Cour&s;es, and would do the be&s;t to repair Things he</HI>

<HI>could.</HI> This An&s;wer gave Occa&s;ion to the Queen to &s;ignifie to the Prior, <HI>That &s;he &s;u&s;pected that Religion was the lea&s;t Thing he or his Party had in their Thoughts, and that &s;he did not doubt, but that under the Covert and Pretext of Religion, he intended to make an At+tempt upon the Crown.</HI> The Prior in the mean Time di&s;owns the Charge, and thought him&s;elf obliged for his further Vindication, to make a very &s;olemn Prote&s;tation, that he had no other View or De&s;ign in what he had done, than the Advancement of the true Reformed Religion, and the Pre|&s;ervation of the Liberties of his Coun+try, which he could not but bewail he &s;aw &s;o &s;ignally invaded by her, at lea&s;t by tho&s;e who pretended to act by, and derive their Authority from her; after which he was &s;o hearty a Pro|moter of the Reformation, that he became the Head of the Prote&s;tant Party.</P>
<P>When Queen <HI>Mary</HI> became a Wi|dow by the Death of King <HI>Francis</HI> II. the Prior of <HI>St. Andrews</HI> was &s;ent by the Prote&s;tant Nobility, to invite the Queen home; and &s;oon after her Ar|rival, her Maje&s;ty having nam'd a new Privy Council, the Lord <HI>James</HI> her Brother was appointed one of the Number, and not long thereafter he was &s;ent with a Commi&s;&s;ion of Lieu|tenancy to the Borders, to &s;uppre&s;s an In&s;urrection that was threatned in tho&s;e Parts; and he di&s;charged the Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him with &s;uch Cou+rage and Fidelity, that upon his Re|turn the Queen was graciou&s;ly pleas'd to be&s;tow upon her Brother the Earl|dom of <HI>Mar,</HI> then in the Crown; but the Lord <HI>Erskine</HI> being found to have Right to the Earldom of <HI>Mar,</HI> that Lord was by Way of Ju&s;tice re&s;tored to that Honour, in Lieu whereof the Prior of <HI>St. Andrews</HI> was made Earl of <HI>Murray,</HI> 10th <HI>February</HI> 1562<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Charta in Pub.

<P>After this the Earl continued in the greate&s;t Favour with the Queen, without any Interruption, till the 1565 that her Maje&s;ty declared her Re&s;olu|tion to marry the Lord <HI>Darnly,</HI> that my Lord <HI>Murray</HI> and many others did oppo&s;e the Match, upon Pretext of the Danger that might ari&s;e to Reli|gion and to the State by that Union, fora&s;much as it had not been practi&s;ed at any Time, to impo&s;e a King upon the Nation without the Advice and Con&s;ent of Parliament; and in order to put a more effectual Stop thereto, <HI>They made,</HI> &s;ays Sir <HI>James Melvil, an E&s;&s;ay to take the Lord</HI> Darnly <HI>in the Queen's Company at the Raid of</HI> Baith, <HI>and as they alledged, to have &s;ent him to</HI> England: But &s;ailing in their En|terpri&s;e, they were &s;o clo&s;ely pur&s;ued by the Queen's Troops, that they thought it the &s;afe&s;t Cour&s;e for them to flee to <HI>England,</HI> where they met but with a very cold Reception from Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> tho' &s;he had very much encourag'd them under-hand to enter into tho&s;e Mea&s;ures, to di&s;turb the Peace and Tranquillity of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to fully the Glory of Queen <HI>Ma|ry</HI>'s Reign.</P>
<P>After the Queen's Marriage with the Lord <HI>Darnly,</HI> a Parliament was call'd, before which the Earl of <HI>Mur|ray</HI> and his A&s;&s;ociates were &s;ummon'd to an&s;wer a Charge of High-Trea&s;on, which was prepar'd again&s;t them, and the Earl would have undoubted|ly been denounced Rebel, and for|faulted, had not the Murther of <HI>Da|vid Rizio</HI> prevented it, which hap|pen'd Three Days before the &s;itting down of the Parliament.

Evidence came again&s;t him, and the Queen believing him innocent of <HI>Rizio</HI>'s Murther, was plea&s;ed to give him a gracious Pardon, re&s;tore him to her wonted Favour, and to place an un&s;u&s;pected Confidence in him; but the Broils of the Country &s;till in|crea&s;ing more and more, e&s;pecially af|ter the Murther of the Lord <HI>Darnly,</HI> he obtain'd the Queen's Leave to tra|vel, which he did, fir&s;t into <HI>England,</HI> and thence into <HI>France,</HI> where he re|mained till the Queen had made a Re|&s;ignation of the Government, and the Prince King <HI>James</HI> VI. her Son, &s;et upon the Throne, that he was call'd hom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> to be Regent to the young King; to which Office he was cho&s;en by tho&s;e of the Nobility who adhered to the Prince in his Ab&s;ence, on the 22d of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1567.

<P>Sir <HI>Laurence Oliphant</HI> of <HI>Aberdalgy,</HI> in his Youth went over to <HI>France,</HI> in Company with the Earl of <HI>Dougla&s;s,</HI> and other young Noblemen, to learn the Art of War<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Hathornden's Hi&s;tory.</NOTE>; and after that he travell'd into <HI>Italy</HI> and &s;everal Foreign Parts.

<P>In the 1484, the Lord <HI>Oliphant</HI> was named one of the Plenipotentiaries on the Part of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who met at the Congre&s;s at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> with others commi&s;&s;ion'd by the King of <HI>England,</HI> in order to take away all Grievances betwixt the Two Realms; by whom at Length a Truce was agreed to, which was to begin at the Ri&s;ing of the Sun on the 29th of the In&s;tant Month of <HI>September,</HI> and to la&s;t till the Setting of the Sun on the 29th of <HI>September</HI> 1487, of which his Lord|&s;hip was one of the Con&s;ervators<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Rymer.</NOTE>;

And in order to take away, as much as po&s;&s;ible, all Grounds and Occa&s;ions of Di&s;cord betwixt the Two Nations, he was one of the Amba&s;&s;adors on the Part of <HI>Scotland,</HI> authoriz'd to treat about a Marriage betwixt <HI>James</HI> Prince of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Anne de la Pool,</HI> Daughter of <HI>John</HI> Duke of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> and Niece of King <HI>Richard</HI> of <HI>England;</HI> which, tho' it was agreed to, yet by Rea&s;on of the &s;hort Life of King <HI>Ri|chard</HI> her Uncle, and the &s;ub&s;equent Revolution in <HI>England,</HI> the Marriage did never take Effect.

<P>He was a great Lover of his Coun|try, which he alwi&s;e manife&s;ted; for in the Matter of the Billoting in Par|liament, tho' he was the Parl of <HI>Middleton</HI>'s Friend, yet he could ne|ver be brought to favour that Pro|ject but oppo&s;ed it with all his Power: Which the Earl of <HI>Middleton</HI> did not re&s;ent again&s;t Sir <HI>Archbald,</HI> well know|ing, as he him&s;elf owns, that the Lord Regi&s;ter's oppo&s;ing him in the Project of the Billoting, did not pro|ceed from any Di&s;like to his Lord|&s;hips Per&s;on, but from his known Principles of Moderation, and the Earl did not only then acknowledge the Sincerity of the Regi&s;ter's Friend|&s;hip to him, but even afterwards, at a Time when Profe&s;&s;ing to be the Lord <HI>Middleton</HI>'s Friend, was not thought very meritorious.</P>

<P><HI>James</HI> Duke of <HI>Queensbery</HI> his Son and Succe&s;&s;or, was born on the 18th of <HI>December</HI> 1662, after he had gone thro' the Cour&s;e of his Studies at the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> he went into Foreign Parts, to accompli&s;h him&s;elf by Travels, <HI>Anno</HI> 1680. and upon his Return in 1684, was by King <HI>Charles</HI> II. made one of the Privy Council, and Lieutenant Colonel of a Regiment of Hor&s;e commanded by Lieutenant General <HI>Graham,</HI> there|after Vi&s;count of <HI>Dundee;</HI> and he continued in the&s;e Po&s;ts till the Year 1688, about which Time he quitted them for Ill U&s;age at Court, and upon the Account of the Di&s;agree|ment of his Principles with their Mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>The Revolution then happening to come on, he appear'd early in it, and was by the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> upon his Acceptance of the Govern|ment, made Colonel of the <HI>Scots</HI> Hor&s;e-Guards, and at the &s;ame Time one of the Privy Council, and one of the Gentlemen of his Maje&s;ty's Bed-Chamber.</P>
<P>In the 1690 King <HI>William</HI> &s;ent him into <HI>Scotland,</HI> to command a &s;eparate Body of Troops under Lieutenant Ge|neral <HI>Mackay;</HI> Two Years after, he was made one of the Lords of the Trea&s;ury; and in the Parliament 1693, he was authorized to &s;it and vote as Lord High Trea&s;urer, his Fa|ther being then alive, and he not a Peer, could not otherwi&s;e &s;it, but as an Officer of State, which depends on the Sovereign's Nomination.</P>
<P>The Duke his Father departing this Life as afore&s;aid in 1695, he laid a&s;ide all Thoughts of Military Em|ployments, quitted the Command of the Guards, and was thereupon made Lord Privy Seal, and one of the Ex|traordinary Lords of the Se&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty in 1700 was pleas'd to make him Lord High Commi&s;&s;io|ner to repre&s;ent his Royal Per&s;on in Parliament, where he held Two Se&s;|&s;ions by virtue of Two di&s;tinct Pa|tents; and upon his Return to Court, his Maje&s;ty on the 18th <HI>June</HI> 1701, was pleas'd to honour the Duke with a di&s;tingui&s;hing Mark of his Royal Favour, for that Evening, a Chapter being held of the mo&s;t noble Order of the Garter at <HI>Ken&s;ingtoun,</HI> where the Sovereign was pre&s;ent, the Duke was then elected a Companion of the Order, and in&s;tall'd at <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> the 10th of <HI>July</HI> thereafter.

The former Par|liament being di&s;&s;olved, it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary another &s;hould be call'd, as had been u&s;ual at the Entrance of all Sovereigns to the Crown; and therefore her Maje&s;ty i&s;&s;ued out Writs for the Calling of a new Parliament, which met according to Summons upon the 6th of <HI>May</HI> 1703, to which the Queen was pleas'd to honour the Duke of <HI>Queensberry,</HI> by appoint|ing his Grace to repre&s;ent her Royal Per&s;on, as Lord High Commi&s;&s;ioner. The Parliament being open'd with great Solemnity, they began chear|fully in pa&s;&s;ing an Act, recognizing her Maje&s;ty's Title to the Crown; but that Unanimity did not long continue among them; for a very &s;trong Party in the Parliament ha|ving brought in and carried an Act for the Security of the Kingdom, pre|&s;ented it to the Lord Commi&s;&s;ioner, for the Royal A&s;&s;ent; but the <HI>Act of Security</HI> being tran&s;mitted to the Court, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mini&s;try were &s;o wholly aver&s;e to it, and the Country Party in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> as &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ting to have it pa&s;s, all the Duke could well do in &s;uch a Conjuncture, was to keep it off till he &s;hould receive In&s;tructions from above; which he did with the out|mo&s;t Dexterity, till her Maj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ty ha|ving declared that &s;ome Difficulties having fallen in in that Affair, &s;o much pre&s;s'd, &s;he would take Time to con&s;ider them before &s;he could be determined to give the Royal Ap|probation; and therefore ordered the Lord High Commi&s;&s;ioner to adjourn the Parliament on the 16th of <HI>Septem|ber,</HI> after they had &s;at full Three Months, which the Lord Chancellor did in the u&s;ual Forms.</P>
<P>How great &s;oever the&s;e Services of the Duke's were e&s;teemed to be for a Time, yet 'tis certain, that in le&s;s than a Year thereafter, upon a Change of &s;ome Mea&s;ures at Court, his Grace was remov'd from all Publick Em|ployments, except that of one of the Extraordinary Lords of the Se&s;&s;ion, which was for Life, and of which he could not be deprived.</P>
<P>But upon another Change at Court in the 1705, when the Duke of <HI>Ar|gyle</HI> was declared Commi&s;&s;ioner for holding the Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament that Year, the Duke of <HI>Queensbe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ry</HI> was made Lord Privy Seal in Place of the Earl of <HI>Rothes,</HI> and one of the

<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners of both King|doms having accordingly met at <HI>Lon|don</HI> on the 16th of <HI>April</HI> 1706, the Preliminaries were ea&s;ily agreed to on the 24th.

<P>So difficult and nice a Work as incorporating the Two Kingdoms, could not be effected without very con&s;iderable Oppo&s;ition, both from within Doors and without; but his Grace being &s;upported by her Maje|&s;ty's Authority, and a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ll and hearty Concu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ce of a Majority in the Parliament, (who were well affected to the Union) went on vigorou&s;ly in the Pro&s;ecution of his Duty, and with &s;o much Di&s;patch, that the whole Treaty was enacted and ra|tified on the 16th of <HI>January</HI> 1707, by the Lord Commi&s;&s;ioner by the Touch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">f the Royal Scepter, in the u&s;ual Manner.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Queensberry</HI> having thus concluded the Union, and &s;ur|mounted all the Difficulties he met in his Way to compleat it, in <HI>April</HI> thereafter &s;et out for <HI>London,</HI> where he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ound that gracious Re|ception from the Queen which his eminent Services h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d de&s;erved: And it was but very ju&s;t that he who had expended &s;o much of his Time in the publick Service, &s;hould have &s;ome &s;uitable Compen&s;ation; and there|fore the Queen gave him the Compli|ment of a Pen&s;ion of 3000 <HI>L per An|num</HI> out of the Fo&s;t Office.

<P>Which <HI>George</HI> being a Nobleman of great Wi&s;dom and Prudence, was much e&s;teemed by King <HI>James</HI> V. who carried him over to <HI>France</HI> in the 1537, when his Maje&s;ty was e|&s;pou&s;ed to <HI>Magdalen</HI> a Daughter of that Crown: After who&s;e Death, during the Regency of the Duke of <HI>Chattlerault,</HI> he was &s;ent Amba&s;&s;ador to <HI>Denmark,</HI> in which Negociation he behav'd him&s;elf with great Pru|dence and Dexterity; and being look'd on generally throughout the King|dom as a very wi&s;e Man, he was na|med one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners to go to <HI>France,</HI> to the Queen's Marriage with the Dauphine, where he died at <HI>Deip,</HI> on the 9th of <HI>November</HI> 1558, not without Su&s;picion of being poi|&s;oned.</P>
<P>I'm heartily &s;orry, there are not &s;uch Documents in my Hands as &s;hould fully enable me to &s;et the Mar|riages of this noble Earl in a true Light. Mr. <HI>Le&s;ly</HI> gives the Preference to Lady <HI>Margaret Crichton,</HI> as the Earl's fir&s;t Lawful Wife, tho' I think his Authority is little to be valued; for 'tis clear from a Charter of <HI>George</HI> Earl of <HI>Rothes</HI> in the 1528, wherein he gives both <HI>Nicolas Somervel</HI> and <HI>Margaret Crichton</HI> a Liferent out of the &s;ame Lands; Mrs. <HI>Somervel</HI> is expre&s;ly call'd his Wife, and is fir&s;t mentioned before the other La|dy, who is no otherwi&s;e de&s;igned than by her Name, tho' &s;he was of much greater Quality of Birth than the other: Yet 'tis al&s;o clear by ano|ther Charter, in the 1542, That La|dy <HI>Margaret Crichton</HI> is de&s;igned, <HI>Coun|te&s;s of Rothes</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Charta in Pub. Arch. ad Annum 1542.</NOTE>, and then is cer|tainly his lawful Wife. For the clearing this Matter, I &s;hall humbly
<PB N="429" REF="439">
offer my Opinion about it, from &s;uch Writs, as I have &s;een relative to it. The Ca&s;e I take to have been this, The Earl of <HI>Rothes</HI> in the Heat of Youth, and without a Di&s;pen&s;ation, according to the Rites of the Chuch, for the Earl and the Lady were with|in the forbidden Degrees, did unca|nonically marry Lady <HI>Mary Crichton,</HI> the Lord <HI>Crichton</HI>'s Daughter, which then in the Con&s;truction of the Law, could not be valid without a Di&s;|pen&s;ation, or the Children con&s;ide|red as begot in lawful Marriage, tho' certainly the Earl thought otherwi&s;e him&s;elf; for when <HI>Norman</HI> his Son by her, was a very young Man, he put him in Fie of his E&s;tate, and in all the Tran&s;actions afterwards about it, upon his Forfaulture, he's never de&s;igned the Earl's natural Son, but only his Son &s;imply, and Fiar of the Earldom of <HI>Rothes,</HI></P>
<P>And probably the Earl and the La|dy di&s;agreeing, they cho&s;e to live &s;e|parate, or &s;he left him, and he mar|ried again, as was commonly done in that Time, <HI>Nicholas Somervel,</HI> Daughter of Sir <HI>John Somervel</HI> of <HI>Camnethan,</HI> and Widow of <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Fleming,</HI> by whom he had <HI>Andrew</HI> his Father's Succe&s;&s;or in the E&s;tate and Honour; and the Lady dying &s;oon thereafter, the Earl was again reconciled to Lady <HI>Margaret Chrich|ton,</HI> and legally married her, other|wi&s;e &s;he could not have been, as I ob&s;erved, &s;he was, de&s;igned Counte&s;s of <HI>Rothes;</HI> and in this State of law|ful Marriage, &s;he bare the Earl a Son, <HI>Robert Le&s;ly,</HI> the Founder of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Findra&s;&s;y;</HI> and from his being Brother to <HI>Norman</HI> the Ma&s;ter of <HI>Rothes,</HI> both of the &s;ame Father and Mother, has the Mi&s;take pro|ceeded, and the Story been patch'd up of his being, as he is call'd, the <HI>righteous Rothes;</HI> for 'tis plain, that <HI>Norman</HI> being forfaulted for the Mur|der of Cardinal <HI>Beaton,</HI> his Father the Earl redeemed his own E&s;tate again in the Terms he had made it over to him, and &s;o could not but in Ju&s;tice &s;ettle it upon his Son <HI>Andrew,</HI> who being indi&s;puteably born in law|ful Marriage, was preferable to <HI>Ro|bert,</HI> who was not born of <HI>Margaret Crichton,</HI> till very long after the Death of Dame <HI>Nicholas Somervel;</HI> for 'tis plain at fir&s;t the Earl had no other Son by <HI>Margaret Crichton,</HI> but the afore&s;aid <HI>Norman</HI> Ma&s;ter of <HI>Ro|thes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Andrew</HI> Earl of <HI>Rothes</HI> &s;o &s;ucceed|ing, his Father, was very faithful to Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> throughout her whole unfortunate Life, and was highly ho|noured by King <HI>James</HI> as a Noble|man of great Honour and Probity.

In the 1670, when a Treaty was &s;et on Foot for uniting the Two King|doms of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> the Lord <HI>Stair</HI> was named one of the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners for that important Affair; and tho the Treaty did not take Effect, yet the Lord <HI>Stair</HI> in the &s;everal Di&s;|cour&s;es that pa&s;&s;ed on that Subject, gave &s;uch clear Proofs of his great Knowledge in our Con&s;titution and the Laws, that the next en&s;uing Year Sir <HI>John Gilmoir</HI> Lord Pre&s;ident re|&s;igning his Office, his Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to confer it upon him, and his Promotion was not attended with any Envy or Di&s;like, &s;o far as I have ever heard.</P>
<P>As my Lord <HI>Stair</HI> was a great Lover of his Country, and had the true Inte|re&s;t of it always very much at Heart, &s;o he embraced every Opportunity to promote and advance the Good of the Nation; for it was the Lord Pre|&s;ident, and &s;everal other Patriots, who concur'd with him, who repre&s;ented to the Duke of <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> upon his coming down in the 1677, &s;everal A|bu&s;es and illegal Practices that had been committed; and the Duke there|upon was plea&s;ed to get &s;everal Acts of Council made correctory of the&s;e Abu&s;es, particularly that of citing Per&s;ons for Church-Irregularities, without libelling &s;pecial Circum&s;tan|ces of Time and Place, which was very ill taken, and highly re&s;ented by the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>St. Andrews,</HI> and &s;everal of his High-flying Brethren.</P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Stair</HI> did with the &s;ame Fidelity labour to di&s;&s;wade the Duke from bringing in the <HI>Highland</HI> Ho&s;t upon the We&s;t, and from obtaining an Order of Council for a Bond to be taken for di&s;covering, apprehending, and bringing to Judgment, <HI>Presbyteri|an</HI> Mini&s;ters who held Conventicles: But tho' he did not prevail in this Point, yet the Lord Pre&s;ident could never be induc'd either to &s;ub&s;cribe the Bond, or approve the <HI>Highland</HI> In|road, for Rea&s;ons founded both in Law and Religion.</P>
<P>When his Royal Highne&s;s the Duke of <HI>Albany</HI> came down to <HI>Scotland</HI> in the End of the 1679, the Lords of the Se&s;|&s;ion and other Members of the Col|lege of Ju&s;tice thought it their Duty to wait on his Highne&s;s at the <HI>Abbay</HI> of <HI>Holy-rood-hou&s;e,</HI> when the Lord Pre&s;ident made a fine congratulatory Speech in the Name of the Society, wherein among other Expre&s;&s;ions he had one to this Effect, <HI>That it was a Matter of great Joy to the Nation to &s;ee one of the Royal Family among them, af|ter being for &s;o many Years depriv'd of that Honour; and the Nation being in|tirely Prote&s;tant, it was the fitte&s;t Place his Highne&s;s could make his Rece&s;s to at that Time.</HI> His Lord&s;hip did after|ward, with a becoming Freedom and the ourmo&s;t Fidelity, di&s;&s;wade his Highne&s;s not to attempt any Thing that might &s;eem to have the lea&s;t Ten|dency to weaken the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the reform'd Religion, as it was &s;ecur'd by the Laws. In the Parliament 1681, to which his Royal Highne&s;s the Duke of <HI>Albany</HI> was his Maje&s;ty's High Com|mi&s;&s;ioner, the Lord Pre&s;ident was cho&s;en a Member for the Shire of <HI>Wigtoun.</HI> In the Beginning of the Se&s;&s;ion, his Lord&s;hip, the Earl of <HI>Ar|gile,</HI> and &s;everal others, were named on a Committee of the Articles for Religion, which by the Cu&s;tom of all <HI>Scots</HI> Parliaments was the fir&s;t Thing treated of: Accordingly the Com|mittee did prepare an Act &s;ecuring the Prote&s;tant Religion; which Act did ratifie the Act approving the Con|fe&s;&s;ion of Faith, and al&s;o the Act con|taining the Coronation Oath appoin|ted by &s;everal &s;tanding Laws and Acts of Parliament, to be taken by our Kings before their Entry to the Exer|ci&s;e of the Government: But this Draught which the Committee had prepar'd was laid a&s;ide, in re&s;pect it was thought to limit too much the Power of a Popi&s;h Succe&s;&s;or to the Crown; in Place whereof a general Statute did pa&s;s, ratifying all former Laws for &s;ettling and &s;ecuring the
<PB N="457" REF="467">
Liberty and Freedom of the Prote|&s;tant Religion. However, when the Act <HI>a&s;&s;erting the Right of Succe&s;&s;ion to the Crown, according to the Proximity of Blood, without Re&s;pect to any Difference in Religion,</HI> did pa&s;s, it was thought expedient, even by tho&s;e who promo|ted it, to have a more &s;pecial Law made for Security of the Prote&s;tant Religion: Accordingly a D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">aught of the Act about Religion was tran&s;mit|ted to the Parliament, which provided only for the Pre&s;ervation of the Prote|&s;tant Religion, as contained in the Word of GOD, which could not di&s;co|ver Papi&s;ts, who pretend to walk con|form to that Rule. The Lord <HI>Stair,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Argyle,</HI> and other Pa|triots were forward to have a particu|lar Standard of the Prote&s;tant Religi|on e&s;tabli&s;hed, that might more effe|ctually prevent <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> get|ting into Publick Offices, in the Event of a Popi&s;h Prince upon the Throne; and the Lord Pre&s;ident urged the Mat|ter with &s;o much Strength of Rea|&s;on, that the fir&s;t Clau&s;e in the <HI>Te&s;t</HI> which was agreed to, did exclude all Per&s;ons from Publick Tru&s;t in the Go|vernment, who did not &s;wear, <HI>That they own'd and &s;incerely profe&s;sed the true Prote&s;tant Religion, contain'd in the Con|fe&s;&s;ion of Faith, recorded in the Parliament</HI> 1567; <HI>and that they believed the &s;ame to be founded on and agreeable to the written Word of GOD; and that they &s;hould adhere thereunto all the Days of their Lifetime, and educate their Chil|dren therein, and that they &s;hould never con&s;ent to any Change or Alteration con|trary thereunto.</HI> Tho' the Act pa&s;&s;ed, yet the urging of that Clau&s;e by the Lord Pre&s;ident was highly re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ented by his Royal Highne&s;s the Duke of <HI>Alba|ny</HI> the Lord High Commi&s;&s;ioner, who the very Night the Act pa&s;&s;ed, &s;aid to &s;ome about him, and in his neare&s;t Confidence, <HI>That the Lord</HI> Stair, by bringing in the Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith in|to the <HI>Te&s;t, had ruined all hone&s;t Men,</HI> meaning <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI></P>
<P>Tho' the Lord Pre&s;ident was plea|&s;ed with the fir&s;t Part of the Te&s;t-Act, which &s;eem'd to be a very effectual Security again&s;t Popery; yet he could not &s;ign the latter Part of it, which &s;truck again&s;t <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Di&s;&s;enters, therein call'd <HI>Fanaticks;</HI> and therefore he went up to the King to declare &s;o much, and to de&s;ire his Maje&s;ty's Leave to retire, and to lay down his Employment; but before he arrived at <HI>London,</HI> his Behaviour in the Parlia|ment was improv'd as &s;o heavy a Charge again&s;t him at Court, that he was remov'd from his Office in the Se&s;&s;ion, without mentioning of any Cau&s;e, tho' he held his Place in the ordinary Way of Judges, <HI>ad vitam aut culpam.</HI> But his Remove from his Place was not all he was like to &s;uffer; for after that he was not allowed to live without Di&s;turbance in his Re|tirement at his Seat in the Country; for his Tenents were hara&s;&s;ed with grievous Fynes for Non-conformity; and he got a Hint from his Friend Sir <HI>George Mackenzie</HI> the Lord Advocate; that he could not &s;ecure him, that he might not be thrown in Pri&s;on. My Lord <HI>Stair</HI> finding him&s;elf in the&s;e Cir|cum&s;tances, thought it &s;afer for him to retire, and to go into a voluntary Exile into <HI>Holland</HI> in the End of 1682, where he printed his <HI>Philo&s;ophia nova Experimentalis,</HI> which, as it gain'd him great Reputation with the Learned, &s;o 'tis generally read with great Ap|plau&s;e.</P>
<P>While the Lord <HI>Stair</HI> was abroad, many Witne&s;&s;es were examined and re-examined, not only his own Dome|&s;ticks, but &s;ome of his neare&s;t Relati|ons, to find out Matter for a Crimi|nal Pur&s;uit again&s;t him; but nothing was di&s;covered, &s;ave that &s;ome Per&s;ons &s;u&s;pected to have been engaged in the Rebellion 1679 liv'd upon his Ground, or lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ked about his Hou&s;e in the Coun|try, while he attended on the Se&s;&s;ion at <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> However he was pur|&s;ued for Trea&s;on, fir&s;t before the Ju&s;ti|ciary,

and then before the Parliament, upon the common Ground of Harbour and Re&s;et of Rebels: But the Proba|tion was &s;o &s;crimp, that by their own Rules they could not condemn him; for he was a wi&s;e Man, and had taken Care to live with all po&s;&s;ible Circum|&s;pection and Caution.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Stair</HI> &s;ojourn'd in <HI>Holland</HI> till the 1688, he came over with the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> in his Expedition to <HI>Britain,</HI> to relieve the&s;e Nations from Popery and Arbitrary Power; in which glorious De&s;ign no Man en|gaged more frankly than the old Lord <HI>Stair:</HI> And when the Prince was ju&s;t &s;etting Sail for <HI>England,</HI> 'tis reported his Lord&s;hip took the Freedom to ask his Highne&s;s, <HI>What his true De&s;ign was in going to</HI> England? To which the Prince was plea&s;ed to an&s;wer, <HI>That he de&s;igned the Glory of GOD, and the Security of the Prote&s;tant Religion:</HI> Up|on which, 'tis &s;aid, the Lord <HI>Stair</HI> pul|led off his Wig, and &s;aid, <HI>Tho' I be now in the</HI> 70<HI>th Year of mine Age, I'm willing to venture that,</HI> meaning his Head, <HI>and his own and his Childrens Fortunes in &s;uch an Undertaking.</HI> This the Prince took in very good Part, and reported it to others, as that which very much en|couraged him to pro&s;ecute his De&s;ign.</P>
<P>When the Prince landed at <HI>Torby,</HI> his Highne&s;s expre&s;&s;ed a particular Concern about the Lord <HI>Stair,</HI> and &s;ent to enquire concerning his Health, and under&s;tanding his Hor&s;es were not come up, the Prince &s;ent him Hor&s;es of his for his Accomodation.</P>
<P>Upon the Advancement of the Prince and Prince&s;s of <HI>Orange</HI> to the Throne, their Maje&s;ties, who had a very great Kindne&s;s and E&s;teem for the Lord <HI>Stair,</HI> as a Per&s;on of great In|tegrity, and of unque&s;tionable Zeal for the Prote&s;tant Religion, were plea&s;ed to re&s;tore him to his Office of Pre&s;i|dent of the Se&s;&s;ion in the 1689, con|form to the <HI>Claim of Right:</HI> But their Maje&s;ties thought this Piece of Ju&s;tice was not enough to reward the Lord <HI>Stair</HI>'s great Merit; wherefore they were further plea&s;ed to rai&s;e him to the Peerage, by the Stile and Title of Vi&s;count of <HI>Stair,</HI> by Letters Patent bearing Date 20th <HI>April</HI> 1690, after which his Lord&s;hip continued with|out the lea&s;t Interruption in the favour of his Prince, and enjoyed his Office, which he had di&s;charged in all Times, with great Abilities and &s;in|gular Integrity till his Death, which happened on the 25th of <HI>November</HI> 1695, aged 76, and was with great Funeral Solemnity interred in the Ca|thedral Church of St. <HI>Giles.</HI></P>

<P><HI>John,</HI> fir&s;t Vi&s;count, thereafter Earl of <HI>Stair,</HI> was by the Care of his Father, though his elde&s;t Son, bred to the Stu|dy of the Law, and being admitted to the Bar, in &s;hort Time became very eminent in Practice; in&s;omuch as when the Earl of <HI>Argyle</HI> was pur&s;ued for High Trea&s;on in the 1681, for his giving an Explanation of the Te&s;t, when he took it, Sir <HI>John Dalrymple,</HI> who was by this Time very much ta|ken Notice of as a Lawyer of great Ability and Learning, was one of the Earl's Council: But quickly after this, the Court conceiving a Di&s;plea&s;ure a|gain&s;t the Lord <HI>Stair,</HI> Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Fa|ther, and it being well known that his own Principles were altogether a|gain&s;t the Mea&s;ures that were then taken, they had a very jealous Eye up|on him, and he became &s;o much the Object of their Envy, that in the End of the 1682, upon Pretence that he, as heritable Baillie of the Regality of <HI>Glenlace,</HI> interfeiring in Juri&s;diction with the new nam'd Ju&s;ticiar and She<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">iff of <HI>Galloway, Graham</HI> of <HI>Claver|hoa&s;e,</HI> had fined his own and his Fa|ther's Tenents too low for haunting Conventicles; and tho' he had never meddled in any publick Matters, yet he was committed Pri&s;oner to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Edinbargh,</HI> and fined in 500 <HI>lib. &s;terl.</HI> but being &s;et at Liberty, he was again in the 1684, upon various Pretences, &s;eiz'd on at his own Hou&s;e in the Country; and tho' the Officer that apprehended him, brought him to the <HI>Abbay</HI> of <HI>Holy ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d hou&s;e,</HI> in Ex|pectation that he might have been

<P>Tho' Sir <HI>John Dalrymple</HI> was very much frown'd on at this Time by the Court, he would by no Means forego his Principles, tho' his Wi&s;dom and Experience put him upon acting cir|cum&s;pectly, and with great Caution, during the Remainder of King <HI>Charles</HI> his Reign: But after King <HI>James</HI>'s co|ming to the Crown, that Prince, upon his own Ob&s;ervation of Sir <HI>John Dal|rymple</HI>'s Abilities in his Pleadings as a Lawyer, was plea&s;ed to conceive a ve|ry good Opinion of him; in&s;omuch as he was plea&s;ed to make him Lord Ad|vocate, upon the Removal of Sir <HI>George Mackenzie,</HI> who was laid a&s;ide in the 1686, for not complying with the De&s;ign of the Court, in taking a|way the penal Laws again&s;t Popery; tho' it could never be &s;aid by Sir <HI>John Dalrymple</HI>'s greate&s;t Enemies, that he had in any Degree contributed there|to; but on the contrary endeavour'd all he could to animate the Members of Parliament to &s;tand firm to their Religion, and not to open a Door to let in Popery and many other Inconve|niencies. Sir <HI>John</HI> behav'd with great Moderation and Temper while he held that Office; but Sir <HI>George Mac|kenzie</HI> having found Means to recon|cile him&s;elf to the Court, he was re&s;to|red to be Advocate, and Sir <HI>John Dal|rymple</HI> was thereupon made Ju&s;tice-Clerk, upon a Vacancy thro' the De|mi&s;e of Sir <HI>James Foulis</HI> of <HI>Colingtoun,</HI> and he continued in the Office till the Government was di&s;&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">v'd by King <HI>James</HI>'s leaving <HI>England,</HI> and retiring to <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>John Dalrymple</HI> being a very zea|lous Prote&s;tant, all the Favours he had confer'd on him by King <HI>James</HI> and others, he might have expected were no Temptations to bring him into the Court-Mea&s;ures at that Time; and the Revolution coming about, he fell heartily in with it, and with tho&s;e who were the mo&s;t zealous Promoters of it.</P>
<P>In the Convention of E&s;tates 1689, Sir <HI>John Dalrymple</HI> &s;hewed him&s;elf a &s;teady A&s;&s;erter of the Religion and Liberties of his Country, and particu|larly expre&s;&s;ed on that Occa&s;ion a hear|ty De&s;ire, that a Treaty might be &s;et on Foot for a nearer Union of the Two Nations: But that De&s;ign meeting with Oppo&s;ition from Per&s;ons of very different Principles, it was dropt at that Time; and when the grand Affair of &s;ettling the Crown came to be de|bated, the E&s;tates found at fir&s;t great Difficulty how to declare the Throne vacant; at length Sir <HI>John Dalrymple</HI> ended the Debate by &s;uch Rea&s;ons, that the Convention went into his Propo&s;als, and &s;ettled the Crown up|on the Prince and Prince&s;s of <HI>Orange.</HI> So &s;oon as it pa&s;&s;ed into an Act, he was one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;ent up from the Convention with the Offer of the Crown to the Prince and Prince&s;s of <HI>Orange,</HI> with the Nations Grievances and Claim of Right, which their High|ne&s;&s;es having accepted of, they were graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to reward Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Merit and Zeal &s;hown for their Ad|vancement to the Throne, by making him Lord Advocate in 1690, and in le&s;s than a Year thereafter he was con|&s;tituted one of the Principal Secretaries of State; and he di&s;charged the Office with eminent Sufficiency, till the 1695, that the Parliament having made &s;ome Attempts again&s;t him a|bout the Affair of the horrid Ma&s;&s;acre of <HI>Glenco,</HI> he re&s;igned his Place, mere|ly that the King might not be made unea&s;ie by his continuing in &s;o emi|nent a Po&s;t &s;o near his Royal Per&s;on, tho' his Maje&s;ty did highly re&s;ent the Treatment the Secretary had met with, and turn'd all tho&s;e out of his

<P>Tho' the Ma&s;ter of <HI>Stair</HI> did not think he had been well u&s;ed, yet he never &s;hewed the lea&s;t Re&s;entment a|gain&s;t the Court; but on the contrary by his great Wi&s;dom and Temper in|terpo&s;ed to moderate the Heats and Animo&s;ities which aro&s;e both in the Parliament and in the Country, upon the Di&s;appointments of <HI>Darien;</HI> and the Figure he made in the publick De|bates by his Speeches in Parliament were &s;ufficient to convince every Body that he might have been employed a|gain in &s;ome of the highe&s;t Offices of State, but he con&s;tantly declin'd Pre|ferment; for he was re&s;olv'd never to be further concern'd in publick Affairs, than as a Privy Councellour; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">et at the &s;ame Time, not to omit what he really thought his Duty to his Coun|try upon any Occa&s;ion.</P>

<P>The Earl of <HI>Stair</HI> had from his Youth entertained an Opinion, That an intire Union of both Kingdoms was the mo&s;t likely Way to procure the la&s;ting Tranquillity and Happi|ne&s;s of <HI>Britain,</HI> and for that End very readily concurred in the Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament 1702, that Power &s;hould be given to the Queen to name Com|mi&s;&s;ioners to treat of an Union; pur|&s;uant to which, Commi&s;&s;ioners were n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">med by h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r Maje&s;ty, of which Number the Earl him&s;elf was one: But that Treaty breaking off without coming <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o any Conclu&s;ion, it had no other Effect than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o let bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">h Nations &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e it w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s practicable; and it being ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">in re&s;umed in the 1705, by new Authority from the Parliament of both Kingdoms, his Lord&s;hip was by her Maje&s;ty named one of the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners upon the Part of <HI>Scotland;</HI> in the carrying on of which he had &s;o con&s;iderable a Share, both in the Time of the Treaty, and in the Parli|ament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> that many have thought that without the Earl of <HI>Stair</HI> it could not have been brought to a Conclu&s;ion, con&s;idering the many Difficulties were rai&s;ed again&s;t it, all which he ju&s;t liv'd to &s;ee overcome; for being exceedingly &s;ollicitous to have the Union perfected, he a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Day before his Death at the De|bates on that Subject in the Parlia|ment, pre&s;&s;ing the Point with great Earne&s;tne&s;s: And tho he walked home, and dined very chearfully with Company, yet about Four next Mor|ning he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ll into an Apoplexy, which in a few Hours put an End to his Days, the 8th of <HI>January</HI> 1707, aged 59.</P>
<P>He married <HI>Elizabeth</HI> Daughter and Heir of Sir <HI>John Dundas</HI> of <HI>New-Li&s;ton,</HI> by whom he had <HI>John</HI> the pre&s;ent Earl, of <HI>Stair</HI> Colonel <HI>William Dalrymple</HI> of <HI>Glenmure, George Dalrymple</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> one o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Barons of Exchequer; al&s;o a Daughter, <HI>Margaret,</HI> married to <HI>Hugh</HI> Earl of <HI>Loudoun.</HI></P>
<P><HI>John</HI> the pre&s;ent Earl of <HI>Stair</HI> was born at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> the 20th of <HI>July</HI> 1673. He gave very early Marks of a lively and great Genius, having &s;uc|ceeded beyond his Fellows in his fir&s;t Studies of Latin and Greek, both at home and in <HI>Holland,</HI> whether, at the De&s;ire of his Grandfather then at <HI>Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">den,</HI> our young Student was &s;ent, when he was about Eleven Years old. In a very few Months he acquired the Habit of &s;peaking <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch;</HI> in both which he has been &s;ince improved to a Degree of Per|fection, to which &s;eldom any Stranger has attained. His Ma&s;ters at <HI>Leyden</HI> were exceedingly plea&s;ed with him, and remaked, that though he &s;eem'd fond of Play, and &s;olicited his Fel|lows to it, yet he was never found
<PB N="462" REF="472">
out of his Place at School: But while he &s;eemed thus devoted to his Play, he advanc'd in his Learning as if he had minded nothing el&s;e: He was pro|moted from Cla&s;s to Cla&s;s, with the Approbation of the Magi&s;trates, Pro|fe&s;&s;ors and Ma&s;ters of the School at <HI>Leyden,</HI> and had one of the fir&s;t <HI>Prae|miums</HI> at every Promotion, accord|ing to the Cu&s;tom of that School, for di&s;tingui&s;hing the Merit of the be&s;t Scholars, and for exciting in them a greater De&s;ire of going for|ward.</P>
<P>After the Earl had made a good Progre&s;s in the Schools there, he returned to his Father in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and in the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> pur|&s;ued the Study of the Greek and La|tin, adding the Study of the Logicks and other Parts of Philo&s;ophy, under Mr. <HI>Kennedy,</HI> then Regent in that Univer&s;ity. He &s;tudied the Ma|thematicks under the learned and very ju&s;tly celebrated Doctor <HI>David Gre|gory,</HI> then Profe&s;&s;or at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and afterwards <HI>Savilian</HI> Profe&s;&s;or at <HI>Ox|ford.</HI> The Earl had al&s;o the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. <HI>Gregory</HI> the pre&s;ent Profe&s;&s;or of the Mathematicks at <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> And he had the con&s;tant Hap|pine&s;s to be the Favourite of his Ma&s;ters, and to be much beloved by his follow Students.</P>
<P>In the Beginning of the Year 1688 he went again to <HI>Holland</HI> to vi&s;it his Grandfather and Grandmother, to whom he was very dear, and return|ed in <HI>October</HI> that Year to <HI>Scotland,</HI> to rea&s;&s;ume his Studies in the Uni|ver&s;ity, but the Commotions that happened at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> in <HI>November,</HI> interrupted the &s;tated Cour&s;e of every Thing till the Revolution was com|pleted, and the Government e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in the Per&s;on of King <HI>Wil|liam.</HI> In the Beginning of the Year 1689 he went with his Father to <HI>London.</HI> From this Time forward the pre&s;ent Earl, then Mr. <HI>Dalrymple,</HI> begun to ply the Study of the living Languages, as well as that of the dead, and to improve him&s;elf in the&s;e Kinds of Exerci&s;es that belong to a young Gentleman, &s;till with the &s;ame Con&s;tancy and good Effect.</P>
<P>He returned again to <HI>Scotland</HI> with his Father, and &s;aw the Meeting of the E&s;tates, and the two fir&s;t Se&s;&s;ions of the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> under King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI> in the Year 1689 and 1690.</P>
<P>His Father being made Secre|tary of State in the Beginning of the Year 1691, his Son, the pre&s;ent Earl, had the Advantage to be much at Court, which was a new Kind of Education, that added both Orna|ment and u&s;eful Improvement to tho&s;e he had acquired before: And when his Father followed the King to <HI>Flanders,</HI> the Earl went along. In the Summer he was in the Camp, and was pre&s;ent at the Battle of <HI>Steen|kirk,</HI> where the brave Earl of <HI>Angus</HI> was kill'd on the Head of his Regi|ment, with whom the pre&s;ent Earl of <HI>Stair</HI> advanced to the Enemy as a Volunteer.</P>
<P>In the Winter the Earl returned once more to his Studies at <HI>Leyden,</HI> heard the famous Profe&s;&s;ors there read on <HI>Grotius</HI> and the In&s;titutions of the Civil Law, and had at the &s;ame Time Colleges of Hi&s;tory, imploying every Minute to the be&s;t Advantage.</P>
<P>After the&s;e Foundations laid, there remained nothing more to fit the Earl for Bu&s;ine&s;s but travelling to &s;ee how Men of different Tempers and Religions lived among them|&s;elves and other Men, and to learn from the fir&s;t Hand the Genius, Man|ners, Con&s;titutions and Languages of &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Nati|ons in <HI>Europe.</HI> He &s;et out with the Lord <HI>Lexington,</HI> who went in the Year 1700 to <HI>Vienna</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador. The Earl having been &s;ome Time at that Court went on to <HI>Italy,</HI> vi&s;iting
<PB N="*462" REF="473">
on his Way the &s;everal great Cities, Republicks and Courts in <HI>Italy.</HI> At <HI>Rome</HI> he applied him&s;elf to the Know|lege of Antiquities, Architecture, and other Things which are taught there, &s;tudying with much Application the <HI>Italian</HI> Language; and becau&s;e he could not then go into <HI>France,</HI> during the War then between King <HI>William</HI> and that Crown, he &s;tudied the <HI>French</HI> very carefully by the Help of a <HI>French Abb&eacute;,</HI> whom he found at <HI>Rome,</HI> that he might enter deeper into the Strength, Genius and Beauties of that Language &s;o univer&s;ally in U&s;e.</P>
<P>Having made the Tour of <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> he returned to <HI>England</HI> in the 1701, and that Year came to <HI>Scot|land</HI> with his Father, where he conti|nued until the 1702, at which Time there being new Regiments to be rai&s;|ed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> he went to Court, to offer his Service upon the Appearance of an approaching War. The King re|ceived him very graciou&s;ly, but a Scheme of Officers was formed for the&s;e Regiments leaving him out. His Maje&s;ty having ob&s;erved it, told, that he was re&s;olved to provide for Mr. <HI>Dalrymple,</HI> who by that Scheme was neglected, and for that Rea&s;on his Maje&s;ty re&s;olved to make him Se|cond Lieutenant Colonel of his Regi|ment of Foot Guards in <HI>Scotland.</HI> But King <HI>William</HI>'s Death happening ju&s;t then, his Commi&s;&s;ion as Second Lieu|tenant Colonel of the Regiment of Foot Guards was &s;igned by Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> on one of the fir&s;t Days of her Reign.</P>
<P>Being now in the Army (where his Inclination had ever led him to &s;erve) he embraced the fir&s;t Opportunities to appear in that Way, which &s;oon hap|pened: For the late Queen being en|gaged with the Confederates in the Second War again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> and hav|ing &s;ent over an Army under the Command of the Duke of <HI>Marlbo|rough,</HI> the Earl made the very fir&s;t Campaign as a Volunteer, and di|&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the Actions of greate&s;t Hazard and Con&s;equence, as at the taking of <HI>Venlo</HI> and <HI>Liege,</HI> and at the Cannonade of <HI>Peer.</HI> He was al&s;o im|ployed by the Duke as his <HI>Aidde Camp.</HI> It was in this Campaign that he laid the Foundation of that Friend&s;hip with which that great General has con&s;tant|ly honoured him &s;ince.</P>
<P>The Account of the Earl from that Period is &s;o interwoven with the great Events Civil and Military, that have happen'd, that tho all the Materials for going thro' with a ju&s;t and exact Hi|&s;tory were at Hand, yet the Nature of this Undertaking would not admit of pur&s;uing it, or the Share he had in the&s;e great Actions; which be&s;ides has been remarkable enough by many very con&s;iderable Circum&s;tances well known. I have therefore contented my &s;elf in a plain Way, and without enlarging on Particulars, to &s;et forth what concerns his Youth and Educa|tion, which has been one con&s;tant Series of Application to tho&s;e Things which might fit him for the eminent Station where he is now placed.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore fini&s;h what con|cerns him with the bare Enumeration of the Employments he has gone through.</P>
<P>He had a Commi&s;&s;ion as Colonel of Foot in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Service in <HI>April</HI> 1703; in the Year 1705 he &s;ucceed|ed Brigadeer General <HI>Fergu&s;&s;on</HI> decea&s;t, in a Regiment of Foot on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> E&s;tabli&s;hment; and after the Death of Lord <HI>John Hay,</HI> he had the Com|mand given him of the Royal <HI>Scots</HI> Dragoons, by the Name of the <HI>Royal Greys,</HI> by a Commi&s;&s;ion bearing Date the 24th <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1706, which he con|tinued to command till the la&s;t Year of the late Queen, when he was or|dered to &s;ell it to the Earl of <HI>Portmore.</HI></P>
<P>He commanded a Brigade of Foot at the Battle of <HI>Ramellies,</HI> and was immediately after that Battle made
<PB N="**462" REF="474">
Brigadeer. His Commi&s;&s;ion bears Date from the Day of that Battle. He was Brigadeer in the Battle of <HI>Audenard,</HI> and carried the News of the Victory into <HI>England;</HI> he com|marded as Major-General at the Bat|tle of <HI>Tanier</HI> near <HI>Mons;</HI> and was made Lieutenant-General at the Siege of <HI>Deway</HI></P>
<P>He was &s;ent Envoy Extraordinary to the King of <HI>Poland</HI> in the Winter of the Year 1709, where he re|&s;ided till <HI>May</HI> 1710, that he returned to the Siege of <HI>Doway,</HI> and having left his Secretary in <HI>Poland,</HI> continu|ed in that Character till the Year 1711, that Mr. <HI>Scot</HI> was &s;ent to that Court.</P>
<P>Since King <HI>George</HI>'s Acce&s;&s;ion to the Crown, the Earl has been made Lord of the Bedchamber; one of His Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t honourable Privy-Council in the 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">4; and in <HI>January</HI> thereafter he was &s;ent Envoy Extraor|dinary to the Court of <HI>France,</HI> but at the &s;ame time he had Powers and Cre|dentials to treat as Amba&s;&s;ador and Plenipotentiary, and when his Lord|&s;hip &s;hould judge it nece&s;&s;ary, to a&s;|&s;ume that Character.</P>

After his Return he betook him&s;elf to the Court, where he liv'd in great Reputation, under no other Character than a Gen|tleman of the mo&s;t polite Parts and
<PB N="463" REF="475">
Learning. Mr. <HI>Alexander</HI> having an Inclination and a Talent from his Youth to Poetry, he declined all other Bu&s;ine&s;s, and delivered him&s;elf up in+tirely to his own Genius, in which he made a wonderful Proficiency in the Study of the ancient Poets, by whom he form'd an excellent <HI>Gou&s;t</HI> of Poetry; in&s;omuch as in a &s;hort Time he came to be looked on as one of the mo&s;t e|minent of that Profe&s;&s;ion. K. <HI>James</HI> who then reigned, was a Prince of great Learning and Knowledge, and delighted much in the Conver&s;ation of learned Men, particularly Mr. <HI>Ale|xander,</HI> who pre&s;ented him with &s;eve|ral elegant Poems to the King's great Delight, and the gaining the Applau&s;e of Per&s;ons of the fir&s;t Rank for Quality and Wit to him&s;elf, to whom in a &s;hort Time he grew very acceptable.

Of this the Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> clears him, and &s;ays, <HI>That there was never any Ground, either then, or in all the after Part of his Life, for that Su&s;picion; but that if the Lord Trea|&s;urer had been as much depended upon to advi&s;e the Bi&s;hops in the Pro&s;ecution of the Liturgy, and for the Conduct of it, as he was to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in the carrying on what&s;oever they propo&s;ed, it is very proba|ble either &s;o much would not have been undertaken together, or that it would have &s;ucceeded better.</HI> But whatever Su&s;pi|cion &s;ome of the Bi&s;hops might enter|tain of the Lord Trea&s;urer's not being devoted to &s;ome of them, 'tis certain the King had no Jealou&s;ie of the Earl, as if he had been in any Degree corru|pted or di&s;affected to the Government as it was e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Law; in&s;omuch as when his Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed in the 1639. to call a Parliament and an A&s;&s;embly of the Clergy, in order to appea&s;e the Commotions, and to ex|tingui&s;h the Fire that the Endeavour of bringing in the Liturgy and the Book of Canons had kindled, he pitch'd on the Lord Trea&s;urer, whom he knew to be as wi&s;e a Man as the Nation then had, and very equal to the Work to re|pre&s;ent his Royal Per&s;on, both in the Parliament and the A&s;&s;embly; in that great and difficult Tru&s;t he acquitted him&s;elf to his Maje&s;ty's great Satisfa|ction, and did with the outmo&s;t Vi|gour and Fidelity a&s;&s;ert the Royal Pre|rogative, as e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law or ancient Cu&s;tom; and when he thought that was invaded either in the Parlia|ment, or in the A&s;&s;embly of the Church, he oppo&s;ed it with all his Power, and gave them all the Trouble he could.</P>
<P><PB N="483" REF="495">
As the faithful Di&s;charge of his great Tru&s;t did very much e&s;tabli&s;h and confirm the Trea&s;urer in his Ma|je&s;ty's good Opinion, &s;o it drew upon him the implacable Re&s;entment of the other Party, who pur&s;ued him with &s;o extraordinary Animo&s;ity, that in the next Parliament of 1641, they prevail|ed with his Maje&s;ty to take the White-Staff from him, and impeach'd him of High Trea&s;on, of which they likewi&s;e found him guilty; but having refer'd his Puni&s;hment to the King, his Maje|&s;ty was &s;o far from conceiving the Earl had merited &s;uch a &s;evere Pro&s;ecution, that he gave Orders, that in all Events a Pardon might be prepared under the Great Seal<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Remi&s;&s;ion I have &s;een and peru&s;ed in the Hands of the Earl of Traquair.</NOTE>, wherein his Maje&s;ty does not only very fully ab&s;olve him from the Crimes objected again&s;t him in the Impeachment, but annexes to the Remi&s;&s;ion an ample Te&s;timony of his great Abilities and &s;ingular Inte|grity in the Di&s;charge of all the great Employments he had been intru&s;ted with under the Crown:</P>
<P>But this Te&s;timony of the King's gracious Affection to the Earl did him very little Service; for during the Civil War, by Virtue of the Judg|ments that had formerly pa&s;&s;ed on him, his E&s;tate was &s;eque&s;trated and taken from him; and for the greater Security of his Per&s;on, he was forced to flee out of the Country; and tho' they allowed him to return Home, and live at his own Hou&s;e, yet he con|tinued under Re&s;traint till the 1647, that he was enlarged and &s;uffered to &s;it in the Parliament, where he endea|voured all he could to bring the Na|tion to a thorough Engagement to re|deem and relieve the King, who was then a Pri&s;oner in the I&s;le of <HI>Wight;</HI> and the Parliament having rai&s;ed an Army, the Earl of <HI>Traquair</HI> upon his own Charges levied a Regiment of Hor&s;e, and ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ched <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> the Head of them to the Battle of <HI>Pre&s;toun,</HI> where both his Lord&s;hip and the Lord <HI>Linton</HI> his Son were taken Pri&s;oners, and by Order of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament &s;ent to <HI>Warwick</HI> Ca&s;tle, where the old Earl continued for the Space of Four Years; and tho' he was &s;et at Liberty, yet the Seque&s;tration of his E&s;tate was conti|nued: Nor did the Malice of the U|&s;urpers abate toward him, till they had reduced him to the lowe&s;t Penury and Want that can be imagined, and in that di&s;con&s;olate low Condition of Fortune he &s;pent the after Part of his Life, till the End of <HI>September Anno</HI> 1659, Death put an End to his Days.</P>
